WEBVTT

00:20.788 --> 00:23.689
(elevator dings)

00:25.960 --> 00:27.593
- Why am I doing this?

00:27.628 --> 00:29.361
- Because you know that being
selected for the final round

00:29.397 --> 00:30.796
of interviews for
The One is an honor.

00:30.831 --> 00:32.765
- An honor that
I didn't ask for,

00:32.800 --> 00:33.899
considering you submitted me.

00:34.035 --> 00:37.069
Plus, I only got this far
because you produce the show.

00:37.104 --> 00:37.903
- That is not true.

00:37.938 --> 00:39.238
You got this far

00:39.273 --> 00:41.206
because you are smart,
beautiful, hilarious.

00:41.242 --> 00:44.543
- Yeah, and completely wrong
for a reality dating TV show.

00:44.578 --> 00:47.112
- Why, because when it comes
to love, you're a pessimist?

00:47.148 --> 00:48.947
- I'm not a pessimist,
I'm a realist.

00:48.983 --> 00:50.716
- What's the difference?

00:50.751 --> 00:52.418
- Well, a pessimist
sees the dark tunnel,

00:52.453 --> 00:54.153
an optimist sees the light
at the end of the tunnel,

00:54.188 --> 00:57.790
a realist sees the train coming.

00:57.825 --> 01:01.660
- Well, I see this
as an opportunity
for you to find love.

01:01.695 --> 01:03.162
What does that make me?

01:03.197 --> 01:04.863
- An opportunist.
- Hm.

01:07.868 --> 01:10.269
- And to clarify, I
do believe in love.

01:10.304 --> 01:12.838
- And yet, you do everything
you can to avoid it?

01:12.873 --> 01:14.473
- Why am I doing this?

01:14.508 --> 01:15.908
- Because you believe in love.

01:22.383 --> 01:24.116
- Stephanie, I'm Donna.
- Hi.

01:24.151 --> 01:25.851
- [Donna] I'm so glad
you decided to come in.

01:25.886 --> 01:27.119
- Yes, thank you.

01:27.154 --> 01:28.320
- [Donna] Have a seat.

01:28.355 --> 01:29.922
- Oh, um, okay.

01:31.859 --> 01:33.926
- [Donna] So, what do
you think of our show?

01:33.961 --> 01:35.694
- Camera. (chuckles)

01:35.729 --> 01:40.766
Um, all right, okay,
so I wanna be honest.

01:41.769 --> 01:44.870
While I'm flattered to
have made it this far,

01:44.905 --> 01:49.475
I, I don't think I'm the
right fit for The One.

01:49.510 --> 01:52.311
- Hm, I haven't
heard that often.

01:53.914 --> 01:58.784
- Well, I work as a recruiter.

01:58.819 --> 02:01.353
I have built a career on
finding the right person

02:01.388 --> 02:04.022
for the right job, and I
just don't think that's me

02:04.058 --> 02:05.357
in this case.

02:05.392 --> 02:08.794
I just can't get behind
the premise of the show,

02:08.829 --> 02:11.296
the idea that someone's going
to find happily ever after

02:11.332 --> 02:14.066
with a stranger that they've
only known for two weeks

02:14.101 --> 02:17.369
on a reality show is
unrealistic to say the least.

02:18.873 --> 02:20.472
And, if I'm being
totally forthright,

02:20.508 --> 02:23.976
I think the show promotes
unrealistic expectations

02:24.011 --> 02:25.878
about a relationship.

02:25.913 --> 02:27.913
It's a fantasy.

02:27.948 --> 02:30.349
- A fantasy made
reality, like love.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.652
You know Stephanie, I
think the same reasons

02:33.687 --> 02:35.587
that you believe The
One isn't for you

02:35.623 --> 02:38.190
are why you'd be perfect for it.

02:40.928 --> 02:44.863
(Stephanie giggles nervously)
Think about it.

02:44.899 --> 02:45.697
- Okay.

02:47.034 --> 02:50.903
(uplifting instrumental music)

02:53.641 --> 02:55.841
- I just can't believe
you might be on The One.

02:55.876 --> 02:57.910
I've seen every season.

02:57.945 --> 02:59.211
- I hate to disappoint you,

02:59.246 --> 03:01.079
but I'm not going
to be picked for it.

03:01.115 --> 03:03.015
Not after I spent
the entire interview

03:03.050 --> 03:05.117
telling the producer
how wrong I am for it.

03:05.152 --> 03:08.187
- Yeah, but did you tell
them how right I am for it?

03:08.222 --> 03:10.022
(Stephanie giggles)

03:10.057 --> 03:12.024
Your 3 p.m. got moved to 3:15,

03:12.059 --> 03:16.428
Logitech just sent in David
Powell's offer, and your mail.

03:16.463 --> 03:18.030
- Oh, okay.

03:27.474 --> 03:28.373
- [Liz] What is it?

03:30.644 --> 03:34.413
- Uh, it's and invitation
for my ex-fiance's wedding.

03:34.448 --> 03:37.416
- I didn't know
you were engaged.

03:37.451 --> 03:39.751
- Yeah, a couple years
ago for about a year.

03:39.787 --> 03:40.786
- And what happened?

03:42.156 --> 03:44.590
- We had many issues
before we got engaged,

03:44.625 --> 03:47.726
but planning a wedding
definitely did not help.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.761
We broke up, and he fell in love

03:49.797 --> 03:52.965
with his life-long best
friend who he is now marrying.

03:53.901 --> 03:56.268
I always thought they'd
be perfect together.

03:56.303 --> 03:58.103
That's my recruiter's instinct.

04:02.476 --> 04:03.809
What's going on in there?

04:05.546 --> 04:07.879
- They're interviewing
for the VP spot.

04:10.117 --> 04:10.916
- Great.

04:16.657 --> 04:17.956
(phone ringing)

04:17.992 --> 04:19.424
I place big claims
at big companies,

04:19.460 --> 04:20.859
and I'm great at my job.

04:20.894 --> 04:22.961
This VP position was
supposed to be my opportunity

04:22.997 --> 04:24.796
to take on more responsibility,

04:24.832 --> 04:26.965
manage a team, have
more say in the company.

04:27.001 --> 04:29.001
I mean, I thought this
promotion was mine,

04:29.036 --> 04:31.937
turns out they're not
even considering me.

04:31.972 --> 04:32.971
Why?

04:34.041 --> 04:35.974
- Did you ask why?

04:36.910 --> 04:40.979
- No, but I told them
I was interested,

04:41.015 --> 04:42.981
and they didn't
even interview me.

04:44.218 --> 04:45.450
That's a latent rejection,

04:45.486 --> 04:48.053
What do I need, a more
obvious rejection?

04:48.088 --> 04:49.888
(phone ringing)
Oh, hang on,

04:49.923 --> 04:51.723
this is probably Logitech.

04:51.759 --> 04:52.991
Hello?

04:53.027 --> 04:54.526
- [Donna] Stephanie,
it's Donna from The One.

04:54.561 --> 04:55.827
- Oh, hi.

04:55.863 --> 04:57.195
- I wanted to thank
you for coming in,

04:57.231 --> 04:58.997
tell you that we loved you--

04:59.033 --> 05:00.866
- And we picked
you for the show!

05:02.336 --> 05:04.503
(playful instrumental music)
- Are you there?

05:04.538 --> 05:05.804
Did we lose you?

05:07.107 --> 05:09.174
- You're
uncharacteristically silent.

05:10.110 --> 05:12.177
- No no, I'm here, I just.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.847
I'm sorry, I just
don't know what to say.

05:15.883 --> 05:20.018
Uh, thank you, I'm honored.

05:20.054 --> 05:22.654
I still feel the same way.

05:22.690 --> 05:25.290
- And we love that, it
makes you relatable.

05:27.127 --> 05:29.828
We're shooting in a
ranch in the mountains,

05:29.863 --> 05:33.398
it's summertime bliss,
absolutely gorgeous.

05:33.434 --> 05:36.335
- Can I let you
know in the morning?

05:36.370 --> 05:38.070
- That's perfect,

05:38.105 --> 05:39.838
can't wait to have you
on board, Stephanie!

05:39.873 --> 05:42.407
Talk soon.
- Okay, uh.

05:45.479 --> 05:48.180
That was just Lisa and her boss.

05:48.215 --> 05:50.515
They picked me for The One.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.050
(Liz gasps)
(Liz claps)

05:52.086 --> 05:52.884
I don't know.

05:56.990 --> 06:02.027
(siren wails)
(uplifting instrumental music)

06:13.507 --> 06:15.774
(door knocks)
- I brought Chinese food.

06:15.809 --> 06:18.877
It's not a bribe, but I
did bring extra egg rolls,

06:18.912 --> 06:20.412
so maybe a little incentive.

06:20.447 --> 06:21.980
- (giggles) Come on in.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.915
- And if the egg rolls
are not incentive enough,

06:23.951 --> 06:26.284
we just picked your bachelor.

06:26.320 --> 06:29.121
I cannot say much,
but he's perfect.

06:29.156 --> 06:31.289
- Mm-hm.
- He's handsome and he's kind,

06:31.325 --> 06:34.926
and he's funny, and I think
he'd be a great match.

06:34.962 --> 06:35.827
- What if he isn't?

06:35.863 --> 06:37.129
- Well, even if he isn't,

06:37.164 --> 06:38.730
you get an
all-expenses-paid vacation.

06:38.766 --> 06:43.135
You, me, Wyoming, horseback
riding, fishing, kayaking,

06:43.170 --> 06:44.803
cute boys.

06:44.838 --> 06:46.238
- Well, that is quite the combo.

06:46.273 --> 06:48.607
- Mm-hm.
- I'm not totally swayed.

06:48.642 --> 06:49.408
- All right.

06:49.443 --> 06:51.276
Cookies first, always.

06:53.147 --> 06:57.015
- Mm.
(wrappers crinkling)

06:57.050 --> 06:59.184
What does yours say?

06:59.219 --> 07:03.121
- Oh, oddly enough it says
Stephanie will be lucky in love.

07:03.157 --> 07:04.656
- What does it really say?

07:04.691 --> 07:08.126
- It's, it's, okay, it says
fortune is smiling on you.

07:08.162 --> 07:09.428
What does yours say?

07:09.463 --> 07:12.164
- When hungry, order
more Chinese food.

07:12.199 --> 07:14.399
- No, it doesn't.
- It does.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.968
- Huh.
- Even my fortune cookie

07:17.004 --> 07:18.570
is a realist.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.108
- What's going on?

07:23.210 --> 07:26.878
- (sighs) I was passed over
for the VP position today,

07:26.914 --> 07:29.614
and, uh, that.

07:31.051 --> 07:33.118
Matt's wedding invitation
arrived in the mail.

07:33.153 --> 07:35.854
It's fine, it's fine, I'm
happy for him getting married,

07:35.889 --> 07:37.155
he's found love.

07:37.191 --> 07:39.090
- But you'd be happier
if you found your love?

07:40.194 --> 07:41.960
(Stephanie groans)
Come on, Steph,

07:41.995 --> 07:43.628
this is your chance.

07:43.664 --> 07:46.031
- The thing is, I'm
really not so certain

07:46.066 --> 07:48.166
that it is my chance.

07:48.202 --> 07:50.068
- That's exactly the problem.

07:50.103 --> 07:50.902
You don't have to believe

07:51.038 --> 07:52.571
that this is your
happily ever after.

07:52.606 --> 07:54.539
You just have to be open to it.

07:55.576 --> 07:57.042
What do you have to lose?

07:59.279 --> 08:01.847
It's gonna be an adventure.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.116
Okay, you could
use an adventure.

08:06.286 --> 08:08.186
- I could use an adventure.

08:08.222 --> 08:09.020
- Mm-hm.

08:10.924 --> 08:12.991
- (laughs) Okay, yes.

08:14.261 --> 08:16.328
- Ah, okay!
- Yes, okay.

08:16.363 --> 08:17.162
- Okay.

08:19.199 --> 08:24.202
(midtempo instrumental music)
♪ La ah-ah ah-ah

08:29.877 --> 08:31.276
- Ugh, this is beautiful.

08:31.311 --> 08:33.378
It reminds me of my
grandparents' place.

08:33.413 --> 08:34.880
Mm, I miss it.

08:34.915 --> 08:36.281
- I know you do.

08:36.316 --> 08:38.116
- Did you and Donna pick
this place on purpose

08:38.151 --> 08:39.885
because you knew I
wouldn't be able to say no?

08:39.920 --> 08:43.255
- Not everything is about
you, just this reality show.

08:43.290 --> 08:44.856
(Stephanie laughs)

08:44.892 --> 08:47.726
So I know you've seen a
couple episodes of The One.

08:47.761 --> 08:49.194
- All right, I know I
am a terrible friend

08:49.229 --> 08:50.929
for not watching your show.

08:50.964 --> 08:51.763
- I did not say that.

08:51.798 --> 08:53.064
- In my defense,

08:53.100 --> 08:54.299
I have tried to watch
it many times with you,

08:54.334 --> 08:55.867
you never wanna watch it.

08:55.903 --> 08:58.403
- Of course I don't wanna
watch it, I live it.

08:58.438 --> 09:00.138
Anyway, you know the
format of the show.

09:00.173 --> 09:03.575
You and Mr. Perfect have two
weeks to fall madly in love.

09:03.610 --> 09:05.110
- No pressure.

09:05.145 --> 09:06.011
- We'll kick things off
tonight with your first date.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.747
After that there'll
be a series of dates,

09:08.782 --> 09:11.550
hiking, fishing,
kayaking, et cetera,

09:11.585 --> 09:13.218
leading up to the
big mystery date.

09:13.253 --> 09:15.287
- Oh yes, yes, I have
seen that episode.

09:15.322 --> 09:18.390
The contestants
went bungee jumping.

09:19.426 --> 09:21.293
- I'll make sure Donna does
not choose bungee jumping.

09:21.328 --> 09:22.594
- Thank you.

09:22.629 --> 09:24.296
- But you're fine
with skydiving.

09:26.633 --> 09:28.500
After the mystery date
is the final countdown

09:28.535 --> 09:29.801
to the last date.
- Mm-hm.

09:29.836 --> 09:31.102
- The ranch that
we're shooting at

09:31.138 --> 09:32.804
hosts this big summer
Founder's Day event

09:32.839 --> 09:34.639
honoring the founder of
the ranch in the town.

09:34.675 --> 09:37.275
And it is going to be
the perfect backdrop

09:37.311 --> 09:39.778
for you and your dreamboat
to hopefully decide

09:39.813 --> 09:44.316
that it is not your last date
and declare undying love.

09:44.351 --> 09:45.817
How does that sound?

09:45.852 --> 09:47.953
- Incredibly stressful.

09:47.988 --> 09:50.822
- Yeah, I was hoping you were
going to say incredibly fun,

09:50.857 --> 09:53.325
but incredibly stressful it is.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.794
(Stephanie chuckles)

09:55.829 --> 09:58.930
(gentle piano music)

10:03.637 --> 10:05.270
I'm gonna grab some
shooting permits.

10:05.305 --> 10:07.272
- Well, then I will grab
us some iced coffees.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.007
- Okay.

10:09.042 --> 10:12.277
(people chattering)

10:12.312 --> 10:13.311
- Hi.

10:23.590 --> 10:24.723
- Considering the tour?

10:24.758 --> 10:25.991
- Is it fun?

10:26.026 --> 10:27.092
- [Alex] I don't
know, I've never been.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.227
- Oh, well are there any
tours you would recommend?

10:29.262 --> 10:31.196
I love tips from locals.

10:31.231 --> 10:32.330
- What makes you
think I'm a local?

10:32.366 --> 10:33.565
- You're putting up flyers,

10:33.600 --> 10:35.133
and I dunno, you've
got that whole

10:35.168 --> 10:36.868
old-timey outdoorsy
thing goin' on.

10:36.903 --> 10:40.805
- Like 19th century wilderness
settling and bear wrestling?

10:40.841 --> 10:44.743
- Well, I'm not sure the
pioneers bear wrestled, but.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.711
(Alex laughs)
Yeah, in that vein.

10:46.747 --> 10:49.214
- Well, it just so
happens that I am a local,

10:49.249 --> 10:51.483
but in the future,
they know what they say

10:51.518 --> 10:52.851
about making assumptions.

10:53.553 --> 10:55.353
- Are you assuming that I do?

10:56.523 --> 10:57.455
- Have fun on your trip.

10:57.491 --> 10:59.491
Be sure you get all your
witty hashtags ready.

11:01.928 --> 11:03.361
- Excuse me?

11:03.397 --> 11:04.729
- Well, we're making
assumptions about each other,

11:04.765 --> 11:07.699
I assume that you're
a city girl come west

11:07.734 --> 11:10.602
to take a bunch of selfies
of your horseback riding

11:10.637 --> 11:13.905
and your kayaking and you
post them with witty hashtags.

11:15.942 --> 11:18.243
- Wow. (chuckles)

11:18.278 --> 11:19.010
You got me.

11:30.457 --> 11:32.590
I just met the
most obnoxious guy.

11:33.593 --> 11:35.593
- But he was cute, I can tell.

11:35.629 --> 11:40.398
- Cute, uh, well, maybe in that
kind of rugged mountain man,

11:40.434 --> 11:42.333
kinda, okay yeah,
he was totally cute.

11:43.236 --> 11:45.670
But not nearly as
cute as he was rude.

11:46.373 --> 11:50.375
(midtempo instrumental music)

12:04.291 --> 12:05.590
This is beautiful.

12:05.625 --> 12:07.158
- They're setting up
for your first date

12:07.194 --> 12:09.094
where you'll meet your bachelor.

12:09.129 --> 12:10.328
(Stephanie laughs)

12:10.363 --> 12:13.431
Oh Stephanie, this
is Jack and Nancy.

12:13.467 --> 12:14.599
They'll make sure you look good.

12:14.634 --> 12:17.669
- (laughs) I'm really sorry,
that's gonna be a big job.

12:17.704 --> 12:19.437
- (laughs) Nice to meet you.

12:19.473 --> 12:20.572
- Yeah, we are really
glad you're here.

12:20.607 --> 12:23.274
- Is that Stephanie?
- It is.

12:23.310 --> 12:25.744
- Oh, I am so happy to see you.

12:28.615 --> 12:29.748
I hope you don't mind the hug.

12:29.783 --> 12:31.349
My guests are all
like family to me.

12:31.384 --> 12:32.684
- Not at all.

12:32.719 --> 12:34.352
- I'm gonna go find Donna.
- Okay.

12:34.387 --> 12:35.220
- I'm Ruth Fletcher.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.455
I run the ranch along
with my son Alex,

12:37.491 --> 12:40.925
and I've been so excited
for your arrival.

12:40.961 --> 12:42.827
- Thank you.
- I love The One.

12:42.863 --> 12:45.363
I've seen every single season.

12:45.398 --> 12:46.331
- [Stephanie] Oh!

12:46.366 --> 12:47.766
- Now, I know you'll
be busy with the show,

12:47.801 --> 12:49.367
but we have all
kinds of wonderful,

12:49.402 --> 12:52.303
summertime fun
activities all day long.

12:52.339 --> 12:54.305
And I want you to meet some
of the other guests, too.

12:54.341 --> 12:56.875
I'm sure you will,
oh, here's one now.

12:56.910 --> 12:58.209
- Oh.
- He's our oldest.

12:58.245 --> 12:59.344
- That's not nice.
(Stephanie laughs)

12:59.379 --> 13:01.646
- No, I meant that he's been
coming here the longest.

13:01.681 --> 13:03.982
- Hi, I'm Jeremy.

13:04.017 --> 13:05.116
I live in Miami,

13:05.152 --> 13:06.618
but I've been coming here
twice a year for a decade.

13:06.653 --> 13:07.852
- Oh, wow.

13:07.888 --> 13:11.322
- Jeremy's our, um,
tour guide in training?

13:11.358 --> 13:12.457
- That's Ruth's
kind way of saying

13:12.492 --> 13:14.025
I still have a lot to learn.

13:14.060 --> 13:15.693
- Oh, there are other
ways I could've put that.

13:15.729 --> 13:17.462
(group laughs)

13:17.497 --> 13:18.797
Come on, let's get
you to your cabin.

13:18.832 --> 13:19.964
- Sure, sure.
- Allow me.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.268
- Thank you.
- Oh, thanks. (giggles)

13:24.037 --> 13:24.836
Good day!

13:25.672 --> 13:27.005
Oh, and this is Kelly.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.306
- Hi.

13:28.341 --> 13:29.641
- She's actually
the only other guest

13:29.676 --> 13:30.575
who's been coming here
longer than Jeremy.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.510
- Oh well hi, I'm Stephanie.

13:32.546 --> 13:33.745
- Kelly.

13:33.780 --> 13:35.046
My parents first
brought me out here

13:35.081 --> 13:36.748
when I was five years
old, and 25 years later,

13:36.783 --> 13:38.049
I am still coming back.

13:38.084 --> 13:40.585
- She's my honorary daughter.
- Oh.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.053
What an honor that would be.

13:42.088 --> 13:43.488
Except that would
make me Alex's sister,

13:43.523 --> 13:46.591
which might be weird. (laughing)

13:46.626 --> 13:47.559
If you'll excuse me, though,

13:47.594 --> 13:49.828
I actually have to go
onto a conference call.

13:49.863 --> 13:52.330
I sometimes come out
here to work remotely.

13:52.365 --> 13:53.565
- [Jeremy] And what
is it you do again?

13:53.600 --> 13:54.666
- I've told you,

13:54.701 --> 13:56.401
it's the technology behind
the apps on your phone.

13:56.436 --> 13:57.268
- Still don't get it.
(Ruth laughs)

13:57.404 --> 13:59.404
- Well, I don't get
any work done here.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.105
I would be so distracted.

14:01.141 --> 14:02.674
- Oh, I don't.

14:02.709 --> 14:04.709
Any work you see me
doing is purely for show.

14:06.112 --> 14:08.546
(gentle acoustic music)

14:08.582 --> 14:10.114
- There.

14:10.150 --> 14:11.182
- Wow.

14:11.218 --> 14:13.685
- Yeah, I renovated it myself,

14:13.720 --> 14:16.588
but my great grandmother
Aurora actually built it.

14:16.623 --> 14:18.623
- Aurora, like the Aurora Ranch.

14:18.658 --> 14:20.458
- Yeah, and like the town.

14:20.493 --> 14:21.426
- Oh.
- Mm-hm.

14:21.461 --> 14:23.728
Actually, there's copies
of her journals there,

14:23.763 --> 14:25.530
if you'd like to have a look.

14:25.565 --> 14:28.700
You know, there's sketches
of the cabin and the land.

14:28.735 --> 14:31.536
Yeah, anyway, so if there's
anything else that you need

14:31.571 --> 14:33.872
to make yourself more
comfortable, please let me know.

14:33.907 --> 14:35.673
- Thank you.
- Okay.

14:36.977 --> 14:40.111
(gentle piano music)

14:45.285 --> 14:50.288
(Stephanie sighs)
(Lisa knocks)

14:51.258 --> 14:52.724
- Five minutes until
your big introduction.

14:52.759 --> 14:55.460
Steph, it is going
to be amazing.

14:55.495 --> 14:58.429
- Okay, thank you, uh.

14:59.699 --> 15:00.765
I don't know if I'm so nervous

15:00.800 --> 15:02.600
because I'm about to be on TV,

15:02.636 --> 15:05.236
meeting a man I'm supposed
to believe is my person,

15:05.272 --> 15:09.007
or if I'm so nervous
because a part of me

15:09.042 --> 15:11.676
that has lost all reason

15:11.711 --> 15:16.014
actually kinda hopes
he might be my person.

15:16.049 --> 15:17.148
- Atta girl!

15:18.518 --> 15:22.253
(uplifting orchestral music)

15:28.962 --> 15:31.629
(birds chirping)

15:33.800 --> 15:34.933
(water splashes)
- Oh!

15:38.071 --> 15:39.337
- I am so sorry.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.007
- What are you doing here?

15:43.043 --> 15:44.342
- What are you doing here?

15:44.377 --> 15:45.410
I run the place.

15:45.545 --> 15:50.415
- No, no, Ruth runs the
place with her son, uh-huh.

15:51.685 --> 15:53.284
- Surprise.
- Mm-hm.

15:54.521 --> 15:57.555
- And you are either Stephanie
that everyone's looking for

15:57.590 --> 16:00.558
or you are way overdressed
for cleaning stalls.

16:00.593 --> 16:03.361
- I am Stephanie.
- Alex.

16:04.531 --> 16:06.798
- Well, nice to see
you again, Alex,

16:06.833 --> 16:09.634
but as you said, everyone
is looking for me,

16:09.669 --> 16:11.736
so I should be going.

16:11.771 --> 16:13.071
- Got your first big date,

16:13.106 --> 16:14.772
I hope you got your
witty hashtag ready.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.042
Good luck.

16:18.078 --> 16:19.811
- You know, what is that about?

16:19.846 --> 16:21.412
- Good luck?

16:21.448 --> 16:23.715
Oh, it's a phrase used to
express wishes for success.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.683
- No no, the smirk.

16:25.719 --> 16:27.185
- By smirk, you mean smile?

16:27.220 --> 16:29.787
I'm excited for you,
you're gonna meet your one.

16:30.991 --> 16:34.892
- Okay, all right, so you think
the whole thing is a farce,

16:34.928 --> 16:36.728
that if there is a
timeless love story,

16:36.763 --> 16:38.763
it's not boy meets
girl, boy woos girl,

16:38.798 --> 16:40.932
boy and girl profess their
love between commercial breaks.

16:40.967 --> 16:42.934
- It sounds like
that's what you think.

16:42.969 --> 16:44.802
Don't assume I do.

16:48.708 --> 16:49.774
- All right.

16:49.809 --> 16:51.743
Uh, I need to get to set.

16:52.712 --> 16:54.746
- That's right, Prince
Charming's waiting.

16:56.783 --> 17:00.518
(playful instrumental music)

17:03.623 --> 17:05.857
(gentle orchestral music)

17:05.892 --> 17:08.526
- So, I saw the guy from town.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.529
- The cute mountain man?

17:11.564 --> 17:14.298
- Yeah, yeah, it's
Alex, as in Ruth's son.

17:14.334 --> 17:15.466
(Lisa laughs)

17:15.568 --> 17:18.236
- Okay, there we go, this is
our first big introduction.

17:18.271 --> 17:21.739
Okay, just be yourself, this
is exactly like a blind date.

17:21.775 --> 17:24.542
- Yeah, except with
cameras and, like,

17:24.577 --> 17:26.377
soon-to-be millions of viewers.

17:26.413 --> 17:29.747
- Exactly.
(Lisa squeals)

17:32.685 --> 17:35.353
(birds chirping)

17:39.859 --> 17:44.896
- So, um, here?
(playful instrumental music)

17:45.298 --> 17:46.631
(sighs) Okay.

17:46.666 --> 17:47.465
- [Donna] Okay,
cue our bachelor.

17:54.174 --> 17:56.908
(gentle orchestral music)

17:56.943 --> 18:01.779
(Oliver chuckles)
(Oliver sighs)

18:01.815 --> 18:02.880
- [Oliver] Hi.

18:04.017 --> 18:04.816
- Oh, hi.

18:06.719 --> 18:09.320
- Oh, these are
Wyoming wildflowers.

18:10.790 --> 18:11.823
- Thank you.

18:13.693 --> 18:14.625
- They grow here.

18:14.661 --> 18:17.762
- In Wyoming? (laughs)
- Yeah, in Wyoming.

18:17.797 --> 18:18.830
- Funny, that.

18:19.866 --> 18:20.965
- And I'm Oliver.

18:22.836 --> 18:23.601
- I'm Stephanie.

18:29.242 --> 18:31.809
(Ruth sighs)

18:36.049 --> 18:38.449
- What, what's the look for?

18:39.853 --> 18:41.953
- I wanted this for you.

18:41.988 --> 18:43.521
- Ma.

18:43.556 --> 18:47.291
(playful instrumental music)

18:54.400 --> 18:58.002
- So, we've got two weeks to
decide if we found the one.

18:58.905 --> 18:59.971
(chuckles) Are you ready?

19:01.908 --> 19:03.374
- As ready as I'll ever be.

19:07.180 --> 19:10.381
(bright acoustic music)

19:15.555 --> 19:16.787
- I hope you've had breakfast

19:16.823 --> 19:18.122
because it's time
for your second date.

19:18.158 --> 19:19.290
- Actually, I haven't.
- Have a muffin.

19:19.325 --> 19:22.326
- Oh, um--
- Okay, first date today,

19:22.362 --> 19:24.795
second date tomorrow, then
a date every other day

19:24.831 --> 19:27.265
leading up to your mystery date.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.300
(Stephanie giggles)

19:29.335 --> 19:30.701
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:30.737 --> 19:32.036
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

19:32.071 --> 19:33.538
These are for you.

19:33.573 --> 19:36.174
- Well, that is so sweet.
(Oliver chuckles)

19:36.209 --> 19:37.341
I got this for you.

19:37.377 --> 19:39.143
- Oh, wow, why thank you.

19:39.179 --> 19:41.045
I love muffins so much.
- I didn't bake it.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.146
- No, you didn't?

19:42.182 --> 19:43.181
It's chocolate chip, too.
- It's from the buffet.

19:43.216 --> 19:45.616
- Really, oh, wow.

19:45.652 --> 19:48.186
- So, they're right there.
- Oh.

19:48.221 --> 19:50.188
- I'm actually a
little camera-shy.

19:50.223 --> 19:51.789
- Yeah, yeah, me, too.

19:51.824 --> 19:53.224
I can't believe they
picked me for this.

19:53.259 --> 19:56.160
I figured they see how
awkward I was on camera,

19:56.196 --> 19:58.196
you know, or in general.

19:58.231 --> 20:03.034
- I know, I mean, me,
like I am also awkward.

20:03.069 --> 20:04.035
- I got it.

20:04.070 --> 20:08.472
- Yeah, this is gonna be
really good. (laughing)

20:08.508 --> 20:09.473
- Are you ready for a date?

20:09.509 --> 20:11.008
- Yes, I love to hike.

20:11.044 --> 20:12.176
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

20:12.212 --> 20:13.744
- Let's go, then.
- All right.

20:13.780 --> 20:15.446
- You all set?
- Yeah.

20:16.783 --> 20:18.216
- What is he doing here?

20:18.251 --> 20:20.351
- Oh, he's our guide.

20:20.386 --> 20:23.154
- Oh.
(playful music)

20:23.189 --> 20:24.655
For the hike?

20:24.691 --> 20:26.557
- I think for all activities.

20:26.593 --> 20:28.226
- Oh.

20:28.261 --> 20:29.026
- Yeah.
- Great.

20:29.062 --> 20:30.328
- Yeah, let's go.

20:31.798 --> 20:32.930
- Beautiful day for a hike.

20:32.966 --> 20:35.266
- Sure is.
- Absolutely.

20:35.301 --> 20:37.168
- Nice muffin.
- Thanks.

20:37.203 --> 20:40.638
(gentle acoustic music)

20:41.941 --> 20:44.041
- So tell me about yourself.

20:44.077 --> 20:46.277
- Well, I work in
advertising and branding.

20:46.312 --> 20:47.078
- Mm-hm.

20:47.113 --> 20:48.279
- I run a non-profit
on the side.

20:48.314 --> 20:49.880
- Oh.
- What else, uh,

20:49.916 --> 20:51.115
born and raised in
LA, still live there.

20:51.150 --> 20:52.283
- Hey, I live in LA.

20:52.318 --> 20:53.584
- Huh, imagine that.

20:53.620 --> 20:57.188
Almost like we're
meant to be. (laughs)

20:57.223 --> 20:59.924
- So--
- Jinx.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.859
- Wait, did you just jinx me?

21:01.894 --> 21:03.027
- I did.

21:03.062 --> 21:05.029
- So now, do I talk, or?
- I don't know.

21:05.064 --> 21:08.866
I can't exactly, I don't know
that the rules of jinxing are.

21:10.069 --> 21:11.969
- Hey, you guys
wanna keep going?

21:12.005 --> 21:15.072
Don't worry, it's only a couple
more miles to the summit.

21:15.108 --> 21:16.374
- More miles?

21:17.243 --> 21:19.577
- He's joking.
- Oh.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.245
- It is a bit longer
to the overlook.

21:21.281 --> 21:22.913
We can go back.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.615
- Nah, no man, I'm fine.

21:24.651 --> 21:27.551
Just being a gentleman and
hiking slower than Stephanie,

21:27.587 --> 21:29.287
in case there are bears.

21:29.322 --> 21:32.156
- Well, if there's a bear,
I'll just wrestle it.

21:32.191 --> 21:34.058
(Stephanie chuckles)

21:34.093 --> 21:35.359
Hey, hold on a second, whoa.

21:36.763 --> 21:39.463
(birds chirping)

21:41.134 --> 21:42.733
It's a--
- Lark bunting.

21:44.671 --> 21:45.536
- How'd you know?

21:48.508 --> 21:50.308
- I guess I'm just
a quick study.

21:53.780 --> 21:54.645
(gentle orchestral music)

21:54.681 --> 21:56.414
- [Alex] Let's go.

21:56.449 --> 21:57.448
- Comin'.

21:59.385 --> 22:01.185
- This looks great.
- Ooh.

22:01.220 --> 22:03.287
- So, do you watch The One?

22:04.090 --> 22:06.991
- I've seen a few episodes.
- Yeah?

22:07.026 --> 22:08.592
- What about you,
do you watch it?

22:08.628 --> 22:10.394
- Um, no.

22:12.365 --> 22:14.532
My sister actually
submitted me for this

22:14.567 --> 22:15.533
without telling me.

22:15.568 --> 22:17.835
- My best friend submitted me.

22:17.870 --> 22:19.170
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

22:19.205 --> 22:20.805
- And I thought I'd be
with some gung-ho fan.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.373
- Oh no, more like the opposite.

22:22.408 --> 22:25.309
I just, I'm not really
sure that's how love works.

22:25.345 --> 22:27.178
- Well--
- What about you?

22:27.213 --> 22:30.348
- I can't profess to
knowing how love works.

22:30.383 --> 22:32.650
And I'm not really sold
on the idea of soulmates.

22:32.685 --> 22:34.685
You know, the idea that
there's only one person

22:34.721 --> 22:36.987
that can complete us.
- Yes.

22:37.023 --> 22:38.689
- It's just not in love's favor

22:38.725 --> 22:40.291
that out of billions of people,

22:40.326 --> 22:44.028
two soulmates have to be in the
same place at the same time.

22:44.063 --> 22:45.896
- Yeah, not to mention
both be single.

22:45.932 --> 22:47.565
- Right.
(Stephanie laughs)

22:47.600 --> 22:51.535
Just makes finding
love seem improbable.

22:51.571 --> 22:54.638
- I believe the word is lucky
that people actually use.

22:54.674 --> 22:56.374
- Uh, I don't really
believe in luck.

22:56.409 --> 22:58.509
- Hey (chuckles) me neither.

23:04.517 --> 23:06.417
(playful music)

23:06.452 --> 23:07.284
- Prince Charming.

23:11.090 --> 23:12.590
(gentle instrumental musiC)
- These are good.

23:12.625 --> 23:13.557
- So good.
- Lovely berries.

23:13.593 --> 23:16.427
(Stephanie laughs)

23:16.462 --> 23:19.063
(fire crackles)

23:24.737 --> 23:26.337
- Hey.
- Hi.

23:26.372 --> 23:28.572
- So, how was your first day?

23:30.543 --> 23:31.909
- Yeah, it was great.

23:31.944 --> 23:33.411
- So, Oliver?

23:33.446 --> 23:34.979
Tell me everything.

23:36.382 --> 23:37.314
- Lisa, there's
not much to tell.

23:37.417 --> 23:41.352
It's been one day, but
yeah, he seems great.

23:41.387 --> 23:45.689
He was smart and
sweet and funny.

23:47.226 --> 23:48.526
I guess only time will tell.

23:48.561 --> 23:51.395
- Well, 13 days
exactly will tell.

23:51.431 --> 23:52.463
- Okay.

23:52.598 --> 23:54.532
Good thing I don't have
some prefabricated timeline

23:54.567 --> 23:56.066
in which I need to fall in love.

23:58.237 --> 24:01.405
(Stephanie chuckles)

24:01.441 --> 24:05.242
(midtempo instrumental music)

24:11.184 --> 24:12.983
- [Alex] You're up early.

24:13.019 --> 24:15.286
- I'm a morning person.

24:15.321 --> 24:16.420
- Me, too, which is a good thing

24:16.522 --> 24:19.457
because there's a lot to get
done here in the morning.

24:19.492 --> 24:20.758
Believe it or not,
running a ranch

24:20.793 --> 24:22.993
isn't all scenic hikes
and grouse watching.

24:23.029 --> 24:24.328
- It was a lark.

24:24.363 --> 24:26.464
- How'd you know it was a lark?

24:26.499 --> 24:27.565
- I told you, I'm a quick study.

24:27.600 --> 24:28.833
- I could teach you more,

24:28.868 --> 24:29.834
there's a lot to
learn around here.

24:29.869 --> 24:30.835
- [Stephanie] Oh
yeah, like what?

24:30.870 --> 24:33.604
- Ever heard of mucking stalls?

24:33.639 --> 24:35.673
(hay rustles)

24:35.708 --> 24:37.141
(horse whinnies)

24:37.176 --> 24:40.010
Now this is real
ranch living. (laughs)

24:40.046 --> 24:40.911
- It's charming.

24:42.315 --> 24:44.348
- Don't muck a lot
of stalls in LA?

24:44.383 --> 24:46.784
- I clean my bathroom
occasionally, if
that's what you mean?

24:46.819 --> 24:49.587
(Alex laughs)

24:49.622 --> 24:52.022
So there are a lot of
horseshoes everywhere,

24:52.058 --> 24:53.257
like even in the cabins.

24:53.292 --> 24:55.459
- Yeah, it's the
Aurora Family emblem.

24:55.495 --> 24:57.194
- So you believe in luck?

24:57.230 --> 24:58.762
- [Alex] Yeah, of
course, don't you?

24:58.798 --> 25:01.098
- Horseshoes, and
four-leaf clovers?

25:01.133 --> 25:02.233
No, not really.

25:02.268 --> 25:04.502
- No, it's more than that,
it's believing in destiny.

25:04.537 --> 25:06.337
It's knowing that there's
some benevolent force

25:06.372 --> 25:08.205
ensuring that everything happens

25:08.241 --> 25:09.473
exactly as it should.

25:09.509 --> 25:11.775
- I think what a lot
of people think is luck

25:11.811 --> 25:14.778
is actually just hard work.

25:14.814 --> 25:16.380
- Well now,

25:16.415 --> 25:17.481
there's nothing I believe
in more than hard work.

25:17.517 --> 25:21.685
- Whoa, it appears as though
we agree on something.

25:21.721 --> 25:24.989
- (laughs) Well, one in a
million's not bad, right?

25:27.059 --> 25:32.096
- Oh, hello, hi. (laughs)

25:33.666 --> 25:34.999
Hey.
- Hey.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.534
- Good morning.
- How are ya?

25:36.569 --> 25:37.668
- Good.
- Hey.

25:37.703 --> 25:38.903
- Oh, you have something, uh.

25:38.938 --> 25:40.471
- Oh.
- Something in your hair,

25:40.506 --> 25:41.505
I wanna pluck it out.

25:41.541 --> 25:43.073
Bit of hay.

25:43.109 --> 25:45.509
- I was just uh,
mucking the stalls.

25:45.545 --> 25:46.210
- Oh, were you?

25:46.245 --> 25:48.178
- Yeah, so how did you sleep?

25:48.214 --> 25:49.880
- Eh, so-so.

25:49.916 --> 25:53.417
It's a bit quiet for me.

25:53.452 --> 25:54.285
You?

25:56.355 --> 25:57.922
- Yeah, good, good.

25:57.957 --> 26:01.592
You know, the chirping
birds, so soothing.

26:01.627 --> 26:02.893
- Yeah, it's calming,

26:02.929 --> 26:04.495
but nothing quite
calms the nerves

26:04.530 --> 26:07.364
like LA sirens all night,
you know what I mean?

26:10.937 --> 26:13.003
So, um, anyway.

26:13.039 --> 26:16.040
You know yesterday,
what I meant to say,

26:16.075 --> 26:19.743
was this all seems
a little weird.

26:19.779 --> 26:21.412
- So weird.

26:21.447 --> 26:25.649
- Yet somehow, right now,
it doesn't seem so weird.

26:27.587 --> 26:29.353
I'm starting to like reality TV.

26:30.456 --> 26:33.757
(gentle orchestral music)

26:37.029 --> 26:41.165
(gentle guitar music)
♪ Oh

26:41.200 --> 26:43.467
- You seem a little
out of your element.

26:43.502 --> 26:46.503
- Yeah, I think the only
fish outta water here is me.

26:46.539 --> 26:48.339
(Oliver laughs)

26:48.374 --> 26:50.774
Fishing isn't exactly
my go-to hobby.

26:50.810 --> 26:52.743
- Oh yeah, what is?

26:52.778 --> 26:54.845
- (sighs) I love to cook.

26:54.880 --> 26:55.779
- Oh.

26:55.815 --> 26:58.082
- But I don't do that much.

26:58.117 --> 26:59.416
- Oh no, why not?

26:59.452 --> 27:01.151
- Well, it's not as
fun to cook for one.

27:01.187 --> 27:02.853
- Hey, sounds like a slogan.

27:02.888 --> 27:04.688
Not as much fun to cook for one.

27:04.724 --> 27:06.256
- Yeah, that's right.

27:06.292 --> 27:10.494
Although I'd probably shorten
it to a single serving.

27:10.529 --> 27:13.697
- Mm.
(Oliver laughs)

27:13.733 --> 27:15.566
- It seems like
they're hitting it off.

27:16.802 --> 27:17.568
- Maybe.

27:18.604 --> 27:21.105
- I guess I'm just ready to
have someone to cook for,

27:21.140 --> 27:22.306
or with.

27:22.341 --> 27:23.540
- Why don't you?

27:23.576 --> 27:26.777
- Eh, I think in the past,

27:26.812 --> 27:29.113
I just tended to pick
the wrong partners.

27:30.216 --> 27:32.683
I'd decide someone's
right for me,

27:32.718 --> 27:34.618
then I get tunnel vision.

27:34.654 --> 27:35.452
- [Stephanie] Hm.

27:36.889 --> 27:38.188
- How about you?

27:38.224 --> 27:40.958
- Me, I don't cook.
- No?

27:40.993 --> 27:42.860
- A lotta takeout for
late nights at the office.

27:42.895 --> 27:45.195
- Ah. (chuckles)

27:45.231 --> 27:46.797
(water splashes)
Oh.

27:46.832 --> 27:48.198
(Stephanie laughs)

27:48.234 --> 27:49.533
- I'm sorry.
- Wow.

27:51.170 --> 27:53.170
- Are you okay?
- I tell you, I.

27:53.205 --> 27:54.738
- [Stephanie] Wait, oh no.

27:54.774 --> 27:55.773
- [Oliver] This looks.

27:55.808 --> 27:56.974
- Yeah, it happens, lemme
take a look at that.

27:57.009 --> 27:57.675
- Sure.
- All right.

27:58.711 --> 27:59.943
Ah geez, okay.

28:02.948 --> 28:04.515
You know what, this
is a pretty big knot,

28:04.550 --> 28:05.749
I'll untangle it later.

28:05.785 --> 28:07.351
There's a couple extra
rods on the shore,

28:07.386 --> 28:08.485
we can grab one
of those for now?

28:08.521 --> 28:09.687
- Oh, okay, sure.
- Yeah.

28:09.722 --> 28:10.521
- Thank you.

28:11.857 --> 28:16.694
(Oliver groans)
(playful instrumental music)

28:17.363 --> 28:19.930
(Alex and Stephanie chuckle)

28:19.965 --> 28:22.499
(rod buzzes)

28:23.736 --> 28:26.070
(rod buzzes)

28:26.105 --> 28:28.772
- I notice you're goin' a little
short on your casts there.

28:28.808 --> 28:30.240
- Oh, a lot of fish are missed

28:30.276 --> 28:31.842
in the excitement
of a long cast.

28:31.877 --> 28:33.343
I prefer a short cast.

28:34.980 --> 28:38.082
(rod buzzes)

28:38.117 --> 28:41.018
But what do I know, I'm
just a hashtag city girl.

28:41.053 --> 28:42.586
- You took the words
right outta my mouth.

28:42.621 --> 28:44.054
- Hey, more room for your foot.

28:44.090 --> 28:46.957
(Alex laughs)

28:46.992 --> 28:50.861
(gentle instrumental music)

28:52.331 --> 28:53.163
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:54.333 --> 28:56.233
- You don't wanna
be on the show?

28:56.268 --> 28:58.736
- Not any more
than I already am.

28:58.771 --> 28:59.803
I'm a private person.

28:59.839 --> 29:01.905
- [Alex] Ah, a life unexamined.

29:01.941 --> 29:05.275
- I think you mean a
life unbroadcasted.

29:06.412 --> 29:07.411
There's a difference.

29:10.449 --> 29:11.882
- Okay.
- All sorted out?

29:11.917 --> 29:14.451
- I think so, let's try
this again, shall we?

29:17.423 --> 29:19.089
(rod buzzes)
Ah!

29:19.125 --> 29:22.726
- You did it!
(uplifting music)

29:22.762 --> 29:24.461
Oh, hey, I got one, I got one!

29:24.497 --> 29:25.729
- Really?
- Yeah,

29:25.765 --> 29:27.798
- You got one?
- Yeah. (laughing)

29:27.833 --> 29:28.932
- Well, reel 'er in!

29:28.968 --> 29:31.068
Oh, geez.
(Stephanie laughing)

29:31.103 --> 29:34.471
Should I maybe grab it
with my hands or something?

29:34.507 --> 29:35.272
- Oh my god.

29:35.307 --> 29:36.440
Oh!
- Wow!

29:36.475 --> 29:38.675
- Hi, how is it there?

29:38.711 --> 29:40.010
- It's paradise.

29:40.045 --> 29:42.946
- [Liz] And are you
head over heels?

29:42.982 --> 29:45.849
- Well, you will just have
to wait and watch the show

29:45.885 --> 29:46.917
to find out.

29:46.952 --> 29:50.788
And mostly because I don't
really know. (laughs)

29:50.823 --> 29:52.856
- I got your emails, and
I made those phone calls,

29:52.892 --> 29:56.293
and don't worry, everything
is under control here.

29:56.328 --> 29:57.127
- Sounds good.

29:59.031 --> 30:00.164
The VP position?

30:00.199 --> 30:01.698
- They're still interviewing,

30:01.734 --> 30:04.835
so it's not too late
to talk to them.

30:04.870 --> 30:06.203
- Okay.

30:06.238 --> 30:08.972
Thank you.
(phone beeps)

30:13.012 --> 30:14.378
- Hi.
- Oh, uh, hi.

30:14.413 --> 30:16.113
- How are you, how's
the show going?

30:16.148 --> 30:17.214
- Good.

30:17.249 --> 30:18.816
- Sorry, I am just such a fan.

30:18.851 --> 30:21.218
You know, I actually applied
for the first season,

30:21.253 --> 30:22.886
and I made it through the
first round of interviews.

30:22.922 --> 30:25.189
- I can put in a good
word with Donna for you.

30:25.224 --> 30:27.991
- I know you're just
joking, but I'm not.

30:28.861 --> 30:30.861
(phone ringing)

30:30.896 --> 30:32.462
Oh shoot, I have to get this.

30:32.498 --> 30:33.997
I'm sorry, I'm supposed
to be on the clock.

30:34.033 --> 30:35.098
- Absolutely.

30:35.935 --> 30:39.603
(gentle orchestral music)

30:43.542 --> 30:45.008
- There you go, enjoy.
- Mm-mm.

30:45.044 --> 30:46.210
- [Ruth] Is that
your second plate?

30:46.245 --> 30:49.746
- No, it's my third.
(Ruth laughs)

30:49.782 --> 30:52.249
- Hey, Stephanie, now, I
hear we have you to thank

30:52.284 --> 30:54.051
for all of this fish.

30:54.086 --> 30:56.053
- Well no, it was
a group effort.

30:56.088 --> 30:57.387
- Are you being modest?

30:57.423 --> 30:59.356
- Yes I am, I caught it all.

30:59.391 --> 31:01.491
- Grab that pie, will you?
- Oh yes.

31:01.527 --> 31:03.493
- Thank you.
- Ruth, this is beautiful.

31:03.529 --> 31:05.028
- I know, it is, right?
- Mm-hm.

31:05.064 --> 31:08.565
- No, we owe all this to Aurora.

31:08.601 --> 31:10.234
Yeah, her and her
husband had a dream

31:10.269 --> 31:14.037
to bring their two kids
out west to homestead.

31:14.073 --> 31:15.405
- Yeah?

31:15.441 --> 31:17.774
- But unfortunately, by
the time they got here,

31:17.810 --> 31:19.109
he had passed away.
- Oh.

31:19.144 --> 31:21.712
- But that didn't stop Aurora.

31:21.747 --> 31:24.214
She bought this property,
bought this land,

31:24.250 --> 31:26.216
she built up this
thriving business,

31:26.986 --> 31:28.919
and she founded
the Town of Aurora.

31:29.922 --> 31:31.355
- She sounds amazing.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.090
- Amazing women
run in the family.

31:33.125 --> 31:33.924
- Oh.

31:36.128 --> 31:39.396
- There, and then she passed
the ranch onto her daughter,

31:39.431 --> 31:41.932
who then passed it
onto her daughter,

31:41.967 --> 31:46.904
who then passed
it on to me, yeah.

31:46.939 --> 31:50.707
And my husband and I ran this
ranch for 30 years together

31:50.743 --> 31:52.509
before he passed away.

31:53.479 --> 31:55.112
- Oh, I'm sorry.

31:55.147 --> 31:57.614
- And now, Alex and I run it.

31:57.650 --> 31:59.716
Although for a moment there,

31:59.752 --> 32:02.119
I thought I was going to pass
it on to Alex and his wife.

32:02.154 --> 32:04.121
- Oh.
- Well, his ex-wife.

32:04.156 --> 32:07.090
Well, it just,
wasn't in the stars.

32:08.928 --> 32:13.931
(somber piano music)
(patrons chattering)

32:17.202 --> 32:18.368
- Oh, hey.

32:19.772 --> 32:22.739
So thank you for
catching all of the fish.

32:22.775 --> 32:25.275
Without you, we would
be going hungry tonight.

32:25.311 --> 32:27.644
- Well, I guess those
short casts really work.

32:28.614 --> 32:31.815
- Here, a little bit of
my own personal recipe

32:31.850 --> 32:34.985
barbecue sauce, I like to
think it's the best in Wyoming.

32:39.558 --> 32:43.093
- It's, Wyoming's not really
known for it's barbecue.

32:43.128 --> 32:44.795
- Come on, you don't like that?

32:44.830 --> 32:46.196
(Stephanie laughs)

32:46.231 --> 32:48.098
- No, it's good, it is,
it's delicious, I just,

32:48.133 --> 32:51.034
I just always think
my grandparents make
the best barbecue.

32:51.070 --> 32:54.171
They had a ranch in Colorado
at the base of the Rockies.

32:54.206 --> 32:57.274
I went there every
summer, every vacation,

32:57.309 --> 32:58.976
until they retired and sold it.

32:59.011 --> 33:01.678
That was my happy place.

33:01.714 --> 33:05.515
(midtempo instrumental music)

33:09.088 --> 33:11.121
- Here you had me thinkin'
you were a townie.

33:11.156 --> 33:12.456
- Oh, I didn't have
you thinking anything.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.224
No, you did that
all on your own.

33:14.259 --> 33:16.793
- Okay, I think it's
probably time for us

33:16.829 --> 33:18.462
to set aside our assumptions.

33:18.497 --> 33:20.464
- Perhaps, but I
was about to come up

33:20.499 --> 33:22.366
with a really witty hashtag.

33:22.401 --> 33:23.633
- No, you weren't.

33:23.669 --> 33:26.203
(Alex laughs)
(Stephanie laughs)

33:26.238 --> 33:27.371
- Hi.

33:27.406 --> 33:28.638
- [Oliver] Hey,
how was your day?

33:28.674 --> 33:30.140
- Good, um.
- Yeah?

33:32.745 --> 33:35.545
- Did you try the fish?
- Um, I'm going to.

33:35.581 --> 33:36.847
- [Stephanie] That I caught?

33:36.882 --> 33:38.315
- You see it too, huh?

33:39.952 --> 33:42.853
(sighs) I didn't wanna say
anything in case I was wrong,

33:42.888 --> 33:45.589
or Stephanie and Oliver were
just slower to warm than usual.

33:45.624 --> 33:47.157
- But I don't think that's it.

33:47.192 --> 33:51.061
Stephanie and Oliver get
along well as friends.

33:52.431 --> 33:57.367
But there's no romance,
no sparks, no chemistry.

33:58.604 --> 34:02.172
Now, without that,
there's no show.

34:06.512 --> 34:10.747
(lively instrumental music)
♪ Ah, ah-ah

34:10.783 --> 34:12.983
♪ Ah, ah-ah

34:14.253 --> 34:16.019
- Isn't this adorable?

34:16.055 --> 34:17.854
- It's beyond adorable.

34:17.890 --> 34:21.058
- So, how is it
going with Oliver?

34:21.093 --> 34:24.594
- I feel like that's all
you ask me about these days.

34:24.630 --> 34:27.264
- Only for eight more
days, unless it's a match.

34:27.299 --> 34:29.633
- Okay, remember when we
used to talk about things

34:29.668 --> 34:30.867
other than my love life?

34:30.903 --> 34:32.402
- No, not really.

34:32.438 --> 34:35.105
And masterful deflection,
but back to Oliver.

34:36.341 --> 34:38.809
- (sighs) I don't
know, he's great.

34:38.844 --> 34:40.077
He is.

34:40.112 --> 34:42.446
- So why does it sound
like you're trying

34:42.481 --> 34:43.880
to convince yourself?

34:44.950 --> 34:46.983
- I don't know, he's wonderful,

34:47.019 --> 34:49.886
we have a lot in common, I'm
just not sure I really feel it.

34:49.922 --> 34:51.822
- That's fairly obvious.

34:51.857 --> 34:53.990
- Well, what is that
supposed to mean?

34:54.026 --> 34:56.226
- I'm just wondering that
you're not sure that you feel it

34:56.261 --> 34:57.928
because there's nothing to feel

34:57.963 --> 34:59.963
or if you're not
sure that you feel it

34:59.998 --> 35:02.632
because you're not
letting yourself feel it?

35:02.668 --> 35:04.868
- Why wouldn't I be
letting myself feel it?

35:06.939 --> 35:10.807
(uplifting instrumental music)

35:16.115 --> 35:18.915
- Oh wow, spaghetti squash
is great this season, right?

35:18.951 --> 35:20.450
- Yes.
(Alex chuckles)

35:20.486 --> 35:21.284
- Bye.

35:23.021 --> 35:23.820
Hey.

35:25.057 --> 35:26.123
- Hi.

35:28.127 --> 35:29.226
- You buyin' something?

35:29.261 --> 35:31.862
- Yeah, I'm thinking about
getting Stephanie a gift,

35:31.897 --> 35:34.598
but I don't know what she likes.

35:36.001 --> 35:41.004
- Well, um, you
should get her this.

35:41.807 --> 35:44.107
(gentle music)

35:44.143 --> 35:45.008
- Why?

35:45.043 --> 35:46.710
She doesn't believe in luck.

35:46.745 --> 35:49.146
- Exactly, maybe it'll
help her come around on it.

35:50.516 --> 35:52.315
(mischievous music)

35:52.351 --> 35:53.350
Good luck.

35:53.385 --> 35:54.718
- Hey Alex.

35:54.753 --> 35:55.886
Hi.
- Hey.

35:55.921 --> 35:56.987
Hey guys.
- Hey, Oliver, hi.

35:57.022 --> 35:58.121
- What are you two up to?

35:58.157 --> 36:00.290
- Oh, we're getting some
supplies for the painting stand.

36:00.325 --> 36:03.360
- And some extra decorations
for Founder's Day.

36:03.395 --> 36:04.694
- Yeah.

36:04.730 --> 36:06.796
- Your mom's been busy
buyin' out the store.

36:06.832 --> 36:08.298
- Oh, just a few things.

36:08.333 --> 36:09.833
I mean, a centennial deserves

36:09.868 --> 36:11.668
a little extra fuss,
don't you think?

36:11.703 --> 36:14.237
- This looks like a lot
more than a bit of a fuss.

36:14.273 --> 36:15.071
Let me help you.

36:15.107 --> 36:16.806
- Oh, thank you.
- Bye.

36:16.842 --> 36:19.142
- See ya.
- Have a good one.

36:21.446 --> 36:24.548
(gentle piano music)

36:40.265 --> 36:43.133
(Oliver laughs)

36:46.905 --> 36:49.206
Hey. (laughing)

36:50.042 --> 36:51.174
- You caught me.

36:51.210 --> 36:52.642
- I've bene lookin' for ya.

36:57.382 --> 36:59.649
I uh, I got you a
little somethin'.

37:01.553 --> 37:02.986
- Oh, thank you,

37:04.089 --> 37:04.988
- You're welcome.

37:05.090 --> 37:07.290
Now, I know neither
of us believe in luck,

37:07.326 --> 37:09.593
but there's horseshoes
all around the ranch,

37:09.628 --> 37:12.596
and I thought this might
remind you of your time here.

37:13.765 --> 37:15.966
- It's beautiful.

37:16.001 --> 37:16.766
- Like it?
- Mm-hm.

37:16.802 --> 37:19.236
- Can I put I on?
- Yes, please.

37:19.271 --> 37:20.270
- Thank you.

37:22.241 --> 37:23.039
- Here.

37:24.276 --> 37:27.377
(gentle piano music)

37:55.140 --> 37:57.407
- Oh, it's still there, okay.

37:59.278 --> 38:01.211
- I really do love the necklace.

38:03.181 --> 38:04.247
I think Lisa needed.

38:05.284 --> 38:06.249
- Yeah.
- Okay.

38:07.219 --> 38:08.285
- See ya.

38:09.288 --> 38:13.123
(midtempo orchestral music)

38:17.696 --> 38:22.732
(patrons chattering)
(children laughing)

38:28.073 --> 38:29.306
- Hey, Stephanie,
how's it going?

38:31.343 --> 38:32.375
- Fine.

38:32.411 --> 38:33.310
- Fine?

38:33.345 --> 38:34.944
Oh no, that bad?

38:34.980 --> 38:37.781
- Well, let's just say
the televised search

38:37.816 --> 38:39.849
for the unattainable
illusion of perfect love

38:39.885 --> 38:42.185
is not quite going as planned.

38:42.220 --> 38:45.422
- Mm, well, I have just
the thing for that.

38:47.059 --> 38:52.095
This is choke cherry jam
made from wild cherries

38:52.764 --> 38:54.631
that grow right here in Wyoming.

38:54.666 --> 38:56.199
- Mm!

38:56.234 --> 38:57.567
- Because sugar and pastries
make everything better.

38:57.602 --> 38:59.202
- It appears we
agree on two things.

38:59.237 --> 39:03.540
- Surprise.
(Stephanie laughs)

39:03.575 --> 39:05.709
- So what exactly is going on?

39:05.744 --> 39:10.246
- Oh, just the perils
of reality television.

39:10.282 --> 39:12.582
- Don't take all of
reality TV down with you.

39:12.617 --> 39:13.550
There's some good stuff.

39:13.585 --> 39:14.884
- Yeah, like what?

39:14.920 --> 39:17.053
- The moon landing.
(Stephanie laughing)

39:17.089 --> 39:17.754
- Apollo 11?

39:17.789 --> 39:19.322
- It's the first reality show.

39:19.358 --> 39:21.891
- Okay, well, then
I'm sure The One

39:21.927 --> 39:24.828
will try to set next
season in space.

39:24.863 --> 39:27.230
It'll be brilliant. (laughing)

39:29.868 --> 39:31.434
So Founder's Day.

39:31.470 --> 39:32.669
It's a pretty big deal.

39:32.704 --> 39:33.937
- It's our big summer event.

39:33.972 --> 39:35.372
A lot of tourists
come in for it,

39:35.407 --> 39:37.173
we get a lot of
business, a lot of press.

39:37.209 --> 39:38.742
And for the centennial,

39:38.777 --> 39:41.611
we got a bunch of big
newspapers and TV channels

39:41.646 --> 39:42.812
coming in to cover it.

39:43.915 --> 39:46.883
But it's not just the founding
of the town and the ranch,

39:46.918 --> 39:49.886
it's also a special
day for my family.

39:49.921 --> 39:53.390
It's the day where the
ranch is handed down

39:53.425 --> 39:55.425
from generation to generation.

39:55.460 --> 39:57.293
- So when will Ruth
hand it down to you?

39:57.329 --> 40:00.530
- Ah, that is the question.

40:00.565 --> 40:01.731
- Do you want the ranch?

40:01.767 --> 40:03.032
- Of course.

40:03.068 --> 40:03.967
I've been waiting my
whole life to run it.

40:04.002 --> 40:06.803
I've got ideas for
it, I wanna expand it.

40:06.838 --> 40:10.707
Build a center that can hold
weddings and summer camps

40:10.742 --> 40:12.876
and, you know, retreats.

40:12.911 --> 40:15.378
I wanna diversify and
expand the business

40:15.414 --> 40:18.848
because that is how we're
gonna really thrive.

40:20.619 --> 40:24.454
But my mom doesn't
quite see it that way.

40:24.489 --> 40:27.123
She wants to keep it as it is.

40:27.159 --> 40:28.558
Preserve Aurora's legacy.

40:29.795 --> 40:33.296
(gentle orchestral music)

40:35.167 --> 40:37.500
How about your work,
you're a recruiter, right?

40:37.536 --> 40:38.935
- Corporate recruiter.

40:38.970 --> 40:39.903
- Do you like it?

40:39.938 --> 40:40.970
- I love it.

40:41.006 --> 40:42.038
I love my job,

40:42.140 --> 40:45.275
I love helping other people
find their dream jobs.

40:45.310 --> 40:47.310
Except, well, let's just say

40:47.345 --> 40:49.646
I'm not exactly inheriting
the ranch, either.

40:51.283 --> 40:52.849
There was a big promotion,

40:52.884 --> 40:55.952
I thought it was mine, and
it turns out it wasn't.

40:55.987 --> 40:56.786
- Why not?

41:00.225 --> 41:01.291
- I don't know.

41:02.461 --> 41:03.760
- Did you ask?

41:10.302 --> 41:12.335
- Oh, I don't know.

41:12.370 --> 41:14.370
I can't paint.

41:14.406 --> 41:16.940
- Sure you can, you just
think of what you're seeing

41:16.975 --> 41:19.342
with your mind's eye, and
put it down on the canvas.

41:19.377 --> 41:23.413
- Okay, but don't
expect a masterpiece.

41:25.417 --> 41:27.951
So has your mom always
run this art stand?

41:27.986 --> 41:30.053
- Uh no, actually,
it was my dad.

41:30.088 --> 41:31.521
He was the artist in the family.

41:31.556 --> 41:32.989
- Really?

41:33.024 --> 41:33.890
- Yeah, all those
landscape paintings you see

41:33.925 --> 41:34.891
hanging in the cabins.

41:34.926 --> 41:35.592
- Yeah?

41:35.627 --> 41:36.526
- Yeah, those are his paintings.

41:37.762 --> 41:39.329
My dad loved art,

41:39.364 --> 41:41.397
thought that it taught
lessons about everything,

41:41.433 --> 41:44.868
life, love--
- Like what exactly?

41:44.903 --> 41:47.670
- Like, be humble,
embrace imperfections.

41:47.706 --> 41:49.305
- Hm.

41:49.341 --> 41:53.409
- And he used to tell me that
art was like a relationship,

41:53.445 --> 41:57.814
something that you build up
through errors and corrections

41:57.849 --> 42:00.617
until you've created something
beautiful that will last.

42:03.288 --> 42:05.255
- I think you're a romantic.

42:05.290 --> 42:06.823
(Alex laughs)

42:06.858 --> 42:10.627
- I think that deep
down, you might be, too.

42:11.530 --> 42:15.865
- Ugh. (laughs)

42:17.536 --> 42:20.403
- All right, what do you think?

42:20.438 --> 42:22.438
- Oh, well yours is really good.

42:22.474 --> 42:23.406
- Thank you.

42:23.441 --> 42:25.408
- It's much better than mine.

42:25.443 --> 42:29.345
- Well, yours is, has
its charms, it's uh--

42:29.381 --> 42:30.580
- Uh-huh, it's the blue tent.

42:33.585 --> 42:36.085
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, totally, totally.

42:37.222 --> 42:38.288
That's great.

42:38.323 --> 42:39.556
- You can have it.
- I can?

42:41.927 --> 42:45.995
(midtempo instrumental music)

42:48.099 --> 42:49.866
- [Lisa] Ready for date
number four with Oliver?

42:49.901 --> 42:53.436
- After our failed
kiss, absolutely not.

42:53.471 --> 42:56.205
(birds chirping)

43:03.615 --> 43:04.414
Hey.

43:05.717 --> 43:06.849
- Oh, hey.

43:09.287 --> 43:11.287
(playful instrumental music)

43:11.323 --> 43:12.155
- So.

43:13.925 --> 43:17.393
- So I really love the
necklace, thank you.

43:17.429 --> 43:18.928
- You're welcome.

43:20.565 --> 43:21.731
- You guys ready to go?

43:24.069 --> 43:25.735
- Safety first, eh?

43:27.672 --> 43:28.438
Ah.

43:29.407 --> 43:31.207
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah.

43:31.242 --> 43:32.041
Oh.

43:35.013 --> 43:37.780
- All right, yeah, sounds good.

43:38.750 --> 43:40.917
- Okay. (sighs)

43:44.255 --> 43:45.888
So, I heard Donna this morning

43:45.924 --> 43:48.958
whispering something about
a mystery date, yeah?

43:48.994 --> 43:50.627
- Yeah, yeah.

43:50.662 --> 43:52.095
Uh, yeah, that's the big date.

43:52.130 --> 43:54.263
It's uh, they take
us on some adventure,

43:54.299 --> 43:56.799
and the past contestants
have gone bungee jumping

43:56.835 --> 43:59.969
or paragliding, spelunking.

44:00.005 --> 44:01.471
(Oliver laughs)
(Stephanie laughs)

44:01.506 --> 44:02.839
- Spelunking.

44:02.874 --> 44:04.407
- Yeah, I know.

44:04.442 --> 44:06.242
- I think kayaking's
enough of a thrill for me.

44:07.212 --> 44:10.013
Actually, being outdoors
is enough of a thrill.

44:10.048 --> 44:12.315
Wyoming has really shown

44:12.350 --> 44:14.917
that I'm a city boy
through and through.

44:15.920 --> 44:18.254
I get nervous being three
blocks away from a coffee shop.

44:18.289 --> 44:20.790
- No, you don't.
- I do.

44:20.825 --> 44:22.425
- You're doin' good.

44:24.529 --> 44:26.696
- But you, you seem
to love it out here.

44:26.731 --> 44:30.033
- Yeah, yeah, I do.

44:30.068 --> 44:33.436
(gentle orchestral music)

44:38.410 --> 44:40.777
(water splashing)
Oh!

44:40.812 --> 44:43.379
(Oliver laughing)

44:43.415 --> 44:45.014
- Oh, almost tipped over.

44:45.050 --> 44:49.018
(Stephanie laughing)

44:49.054 --> 44:50.486
- Whoa, oh, okay.

44:50.522 --> 44:51.421
I don't like this.

44:52.724 --> 44:53.856
Not very good at this.

44:59.831 --> 45:00.697
- You remember the first
time you took Tango out

45:00.732 --> 45:02.899
and you didn't know
he wasn't broken?

45:02.934 --> 45:04.200
- (laughs) How
could I forget that?

45:04.235 --> 45:05.702
- You ended up in
the next county.

45:05.737 --> 45:08.237
(Alex laughs)
(Kelly laughs)

45:08.273 --> 45:09.105
- Oh, man.

45:11.176 --> 45:13.009
- Hey.
- Hey.

45:13.044 --> 45:15.011
- Is for horses.

45:17.248 --> 45:18.748
Terrible.

45:18.783 --> 45:21.918
- You know, I just remembered,
I actually have to run.

45:21.953 --> 45:24.554
I'm going to help Ruth today
get up for Founder's Day.

45:24.589 --> 45:26.389
- I bet she has a laundry
list of chores for you.

45:26.424 --> 45:29.859
- Oh, just a few, the farm
stand, the games, the lighting--

45:29.894 --> 45:31.928
- Oh, you've taken a
day off of work to work,

45:31.963 --> 45:33.563
how very Kelly of you.

45:33.598 --> 45:35.898
- Yeah, well, when on the
ranch, live like Aurora.

45:35.934 --> 45:37.433
What would Aurora do?

45:37.469 --> 45:40.570
(Alex chuckles)

45:40.605 --> 45:44.006
- Aurora is a really big
inspiration around here, huh?

45:44.042 --> 45:46.008
- People love her legend.

45:46.044 --> 45:51.047
Aurora's known as being
larger than life, unafraid,

45:51.950 --> 45:52.949
totally confident.

45:52.984 --> 45:54.083
But if you read her journals,

45:54.119 --> 45:55.418
you see that she's just a person

45:55.453 --> 45:57.186
trying to make a
dream come true,

45:57.222 --> 45:58.755
afraid all the way through.

46:00.992 --> 46:03.025
- Sounds like Aurora was
a lot like my grandma,

46:03.061 --> 46:04.961
the one who had the
ranch in Colorado.

46:04.996 --> 46:07.063
Whenever I was
scared growing up,

46:07.098 --> 46:09.098
she never told me
not to be afraid.

46:09.134 --> 46:13.469
Instead, she'd just say,
the fear may not go away,

46:13.505 --> 46:15.271
you might just have
to do it scared.

46:19.844 --> 46:21.077
- I like that.

46:21.112 --> 46:22.645
- (laughs) Yeah.

46:22.680 --> 46:23.980
So you goin' for a ride?

46:24.015 --> 46:25.214
- Uh, yeah.

46:26.251 --> 46:27.216
Do you ride?

46:30.088 --> 46:33.156
(birds chirping)

46:33.191 --> 46:35.057
- [Stephanie] This is stunning.

46:35.093 --> 46:36.993
- [Alex] Nothing
like this in LA, huh?

46:37.028 --> 46:40.263
- (laughs) Well, LA has
museums and concerts,

46:40.298 --> 46:43.099
and sushi burrito trucks.

46:43.134 --> 46:44.033
- Sushi burrito trucks,

46:44.169 --> 46:46.235
I'm trying to wrap my
head around that one.

46:47.472 --> 46:51.174
- They're delicious,
but this is much better

46:51.209 --> 46:53.009
than a sushi burrito truck.

46:53.044 --> 46:54.710
- Oh, you say the
sweetest things.

46:57.348 --> 47:00.583
(ducks quacking)

47:00.618 --> 47:02.351
- [Kelly] So I'm actually
just heading into the city,

47:02.387 --> 47:04.453
do you wanna come?
- Hey, guys.

47:04.489 --> 47:06.255
- Hey.
- Hey.

47:07.325 --> 47:09.258
- I was just
explaining to Oliver

47:09.294 --> 47:10.793
that I've got to go into town

47:10.829 --> 47:12.261
to get stuff for Founder's Day.

47:12.297 --> 47:13.262
- Oh.

47:13.298 --> 47:14.831
- And I was just
about to explain

47:14.866 --> 47:18.668
that I'm exhausted from
paddling, so, can't go.

47:20.038 --> 47:21.370
- You wanna go with me?

47:21.406 --> 47:23.039
- Sure.

47:23.074 --> 47:25.174
- Let's go.
- Have fun.

47:26.077 --> 47:29.745
(playful instrumental music)

47:35.820 --> 47:37.987
- So, um, Oliver's
pretty great, huh?

47:39.224 --> 47:41.023
- Yeah, yeah, he's great.

47:41.059 --> 47:44.994
I mean, the expectation that
two strangers are gonna meet

47:45.029 --> 47:46.295
and fall madly in love,

47:46.331 --> 47:48.631
I mean, it's a bit
of a stretch, right?

47:48.666 --> 47:49.999
- Oh, I don't know.

47:50.034 --> 47:51.300
Is it?

47:51.336 --> 47:52.168
I believe in love
at first sight,

47:52.203 --> 47:55.171
I just think you
need a little luck.

47:55.206 --> 47:56.706
- Do you have a boyfriend,

47:56.741 --> 47:59.842
or someone you're interested in?

47:59.878 --> 48:02.678
- Yeah, there's someone
I'm interested in.

48:04.249 --> 48:05.715
- Someone at the ranch?

48:07.085 --> 48:07.984
- Yes.

48:09.554 --> 48:11.554
But it's, nothing's
ever gonna come of it,

48:11.589 --> 48:13.256
it's way too complicated.

48:13.291 --> 48:14.357
- Why not?

48:15.026 --> 48:17.560
- It's just not meant to be.

48:17.595 --> 48:18.494
Come on, let's go.

48:21.900 --> 48:23.032
It's just right up here.

48:23.067 --> 48:23.866
- Oh.

48:25.603 --> 48:27.336
- Hey, what's goin' on, guys?

48:27.372 --> 48:30.006
- Well, Kelly just had to
run a few errands in town,

48:30.041 --> 48:31.240
I'm just tagging along.

48:31.276 --> 48:32.341
- Nice.

48:32.377 --> 48:34.110
- You know, I'm gonna run
into the hardware store,

48:34.145 --> 48:35.278
and I'll see you in a minute.

48:35.313 --> 48:37.013
- Great, I'll see you in a bit.

48:38.082 --> 48:41.183
(passersby chattering)

48:42.287 --> 48:43.853
- What's going on?

48:43.888 --> 48:47.056
- Mm, Kelly just told
me she's interested

48:47.091 --> 48:50.092
in someone at the ranch.

48:51.562 --> 48:53.562
I think it's Alex.

48:55.099 --> 48:55.898
- Oh.

48:56.668 --> 48:57.500
- Yeah.

49:02.473 --> 49:04.774
(gentle guitar music)

49:04.809 --> 49:07.610
(keys clicking)

49:07.645 --> 49:09.278
- [Alex] Morning.

49:09.314 --> 49:11.347
- Good morning.

49:11.382 --> 49:15.084
Um, I'm, I was just
checking in on work.

49:15.119 --> 49:17.153
- Can I tear you away for
a little berry picking?

49:17.188 --> 49:20.656
My mom needs berries to
make pies for Founder's Day.

49:30.635 --> 49:35.271
- Mm, I think I'm falling
in love with Wyoming.

49:35.306 --> 49:38.174
- (laughs) It looks like it's
falling in love with you, too.

49:41.245 --> 49:43.546
(laughs) So, you never
did answer my question

49:43.581 --> 49:45.781
about why you ended
up on the show.

49:45.817 --> 49:46.983
- Yeah, yeah, I told you.

49:47.018 --> 49:49.785
It was my ex-fiance--

49:49.821 --> 49:51.420
- Now what's the real reason?

49:52.256 --> 49:54.023
- I wanted an adventure?

49:54.058 --> 49:55.458
- [Alex] (laughs) Come on.

49:59.497 --> 50:04.500
- (laughs) Oh, I guess
the truth is I want love.

50:06.838 --> 50:09.205
There's a part of
me, no, you know,

50:09.240 --> 50:11.207
there's all of me,

50:11.242 --> 50:13.075
really hopes that I'll be
lucky enough to find love.

50:13.111 --> 50:15.544
- I thought you didn't
believe in luck.

50:17.448 --> 50:20.583
- (giggles) I'm not sure
what I believe in anymore.

50:20.618 --> 50:22.151
- Mm.

50:22.186 --> 50:22.952
I get it.

50:24.522 --> 50:28.157
With my divorce, I like to
say that part of the problem

50:28.192 --> 50:31.293
was ranch life, or that
we were so different, but.

50:34.565 --> 50:36.165
A big part of the
problem was me.

50:38.069 --> 50:40.169
There was a lot
that went unsaid,

50:40.204 --> 50:41.137
a lot I didn't say.

50:42.940 --> 50:45.041
I'm just not good at
puttin' myself out there.

50:47.779 --> 50:50.212
Vulnerability does
not come easy.

50:53.418 --> 50:55.684
- So what are you afraid of?

50:57.555 --> 50:59.055
- What are you afraid of?

51:01.826 --> 51:03.726
- Other than heartbreak?

51:05.096 --> 51:05.895
Heights.

51:07.265 --> 51:08.064
And you?

51:09.600 --> 51:10.666
- Lows.

51:12.904 --> 51:15.204
- You said vulnerability
didn't come easy.

51:17.608 --> 51:21.177
(gentle instrumental music)

51:23.514 --> 51:26.549
- You know what, they're
probably expecting us.

51:26.584 --> 51:27.583
We should.

51:28.753 --> 51:29.685
- Oh.

51:31.422 --> 51:32.221
Uh.

51:34.759 --> 51:36.492
- So, what are you gonna
do with your extra berries?

51:36.527 --> 51:39.462
- I'm ggoing to
make myself a pie.

51:39.497 --> 51:40.729
- For breakfast?

51:40.765 --> 51:42.965
- I told you, I'm
here for an adventure.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
But I gotta finish
some work stuff.

51:45.036 --> 51:47.403
- How's that going, any
progress on the promotion?

51:47.438 --> 51:49.305
- Uh, no, but mostly because

51:49.340 --> 51:51.574
I haven't talked
to my bosses yet.

51:51.609 --> 51:52.408
- Well, why not?

51:53.444 --> 51:58.180
- Uh, 'cause I'm afraid to ask

51:58.216 --> 52:00.149
because I'm afraid of rejection.

52:00.184 --> 52:03.886
- Or maybe afraid of
success or new heights?

52:05.790 --> 52:07.423
(Stephanie chuckles)

52:07.458 --> 52:09.792
What was that that your
grandma used to say to you?

52:11.562 --> 52:14.964
(gentle orchestral music)

52:17.201 --> 52:18.100
- Mm, yeah.

52:21.472 --> 52:24.140
(phone rings)

52:24.175 --> 52:25.774
Hey, Liz.
- Hey!

52:25.810 --> 52:26.742
- Can you set up a meeting
for me with the board?

52:26.777 --> 52:29.345
I wanna talk to them
about the VP position.

52:34.919 --> 52:36.519
- Mm-hm, want it?
- Yeah.

52:36.554 --> 52:37.486
- Are you sure?
- Give it to me.

52:37.522 --> 52:38.787
(phone dings)

52:38.823 --> 52:40.222
Oh, sorry about
all this beeping.

52:40.258 --> 52:43.159
I'm in the middle of
selling my company.

52:43.194 --> 52:45.561
- Wow, congrats.

52:45.596 --> 52:47.696
Yeah, I thought about
selling my agency,

52:47.732 --> 52:50.332
but it's always
seemed so difficult.

52:50.368 --> 52:51.400
You make it seem so easy.

52:51.435 --> 52:52.535
- I do not.

52:52.570 --> 52:56.372
- No, you do, you make
everything seem so effortless.

52:59.243 --> 53:01.577
What are you gonna do when
you sell your company?

53:01.612 --> 53:03.646
- I am gonna throw
my phone in the lake.

53:03.681 --> 53:04.813
(Oliver laughs)

53:04.849 --> 53:06.916
- Hey guys, what are you up to?

53:06.951 --> 53:08.684
- Oh, we were just
doing some crafting.

53:08.719 --> 53:11.320
- Making garlands.
- Very nice.

53:11.355 --> 53:12.988
- Come join us.
- Stephanie,

53:13.024 --> 53:15.658
so pick your project,
garlands or centerpieces.

53:15.693 --> 53:18.827
- Whichever one requires
the least artistic ability.

53:18.863 --> 53:20.729
- (laughs) You better
come and help me.

53:24.202 --> 53:25.000
Oh.

53:25.036 --> 53:25.834
- What do you think?

53:25.870 --> 53:28.237
- I, that is perfect.

53:28.272 --> 53:30.272
- Well, it should be,
you were my inspiration.

53:30.308 --> 53:33.042
- Oh, go on. (laughing)

53:34.879 --> 53:36.345
Ah, okay.

53:36.380 --> 53:40.015
- I'm sorry if I'm overstepping,
but are you and Jeremy?

53:40.051 --> 53:41.684
- Oh no, we're just friends.

53:41.719 --> 53:43.686
He's a very friendly guy.

53:43.721 --> 53:46.956
- I think what you might
see as him being friendly,

53:46.991 --> 53:49.391
he sees as him being flirty.

53:50.761 --> 53:51.827
- No.
- Yes.

53:53.130 --> 53:56.565
(gentle acoustic music)

53:59.437 --> 54:01.704
It's terrible, it's terrible.

54:01.739 --> 54:04.873
Alex makes no sense, he's
here, I'm leaving in five days,

54:04.909 --> 54:07.376
and there's Oliver, Kelly,

54:07.411 --> 54:09.778
I don't even know what's
happening with Kelly.

54:10.915 --> 54:14.383
- So why are you smiling?
- I don't know, I don't know,

54:14.418 --> 54:18.654
I just have this feeling, and
it's like there's this light--

54:18.689 --> 54:19.788
- Of a train coming.

54:19.824 --> 54:21.657
- Don't be such a realist.

54:21.692 --> 54:24.960
- I'm sorry, I--
(door knocks)

54:26.931 --> 54:28.964
- Right.
- You got this.

54:30.101 --> 54:30.899
- Yeah.

54:34.605 --> 54:36.639
- Hi.
- Hi.

54:36.674 --> 54:38.307
- Ready for our date?

54:38.342 --> 54:39.742
- Yes.

54:39.777 --> 54:43.379
(gentle instrumental music)

54:46.717 --> 54:51.754
- Ah, it's beautiful.
- Mm-hm.

54:55.326 --> 54:59.028
(Stephanie laughs)
(Oliver laughs)

54:59.063 --> 55:01.530
Uh, yeah, all the stars.

55:01.565 --> 55:02.431
You don't get that in LA.

55:02.466 --> 55:04.033
- No, no.

55:04.068 --> 55:06.902
Almost makes me not
miss the sirens here.

55:07.905 --> 55:08.737
Almost.

55:12.343 --> 55:13.942
- Hey.
Oh, hey.

55:13.978 --> 55:15.311
- We interrupting?
- No.

55:16.180 --> 55:17.446
No.

55:17.481 --> 55:18.681
- [Kelly] Great 'cause
I brought marshmallows.

55:18.716 --> 55:19.648
- [Oliver] Oh wow.

55:19.684 --> 55:21.250
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

55:23.187 --> 55:24.186
This is great.

55:24.221 --> 55:25.621
- So, I have some great news.

55:25.656 --> 55:27.222
I just sold my company.

55:27.258 --> 55:28.991
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

55:29.026 --> 55:30.693
- Wow.
- Thanks.

55:30.728 --> 55:32.027
- I had no idea you
were doing that.

55:32.063 --> 55:33.329
- Me either.

55:33.364 --> 55:34.630
I got an offer that
I couldn't refuse,

55:34.665 --> 55:37.733
and now, I'm officially
fun-employed.

55:37.768 --> 55:39.335
(Oliver laughs)

55:39.370 --> 55:42.338
- For another two minutes until
you start your next company.

55:42.373 --> 55:44.740
Even as a kid, Kelly
was an entrepreneur.

55:44.775 --> 55:46.475
Couldn't stop her from working.

55:46.510 --> 55:48.077
When she came up
here in the summer,

55:48.112 --> 55:51.747
she ran a lemonade stand that
I swear took in more money

55:51.782 --> 55:53.849
than I make right now in a year.

55:54.819 --> 55:58.987
- No, but seriously, I am
looking at taking some time off.

55:59.023 --> 56:01.490
- Well, you know, when you're
ready to get back into it,

56:01.525 --> 56:03.892
just let me know, I've placed
a lot of people in tech,

56:03.928 --> 56:05.160
I could help.

56:05.196 --> 56:06.362
- Ah, thank you,
but I actually think

56:06.397 --> 56:07.596
I'm gonna do
something different.

56:07.631 --> 56:09.932
- Oh.
- Like what?

56:09.967 --> 56:11.767
- Well, this is
gonna sound crazy,

56:11.802 --> 56:14.036
but Wyoming is
really calling me,

56:14.071 --> 56:16.605
and I have been coming
out here for 25 years,

56:16.640 --> 56:19.007
and I love the ranch life,

56:19.043 --> 56:22.878
and I know it would be hard,
and it's a lot of work,

56:22.913 --> 56:24.847
and I wouldn't really
know what I was doing,

56:27.618 --> 56:30.285
but I'd like to work
somewhere like this.

56:30.321 --> 56:32.187
- You know we're
looking for help.

56:32.223 --> 56:33.522
Do you wanna work here?

56:34.158 --> 56:35.924
- Really?
(playful music)

56:35.960 --> 56:37.860
Well that would be
like a dream come true.

56:37.895 --> 56:38.994
- Hired.
- Amazing.

56:41.132 --> 56:43.065
- Oh, so perfect.

56:44.068 --> 56:47.236
(Kelly laughs)
That's good.

56:56.981 --> 56:59.081
Really good, for you.

57:03.387 --> 57:08.424
- Okay, now just take this.
(gentle music)

57:10.261 --> 57:11.126
- It's lookin' good.

57:11.162 --> 57:13.195
- Hey, thank you.

57:13.230 --> 57:14.363
I don't mean to
toot my own horn,

57:14.398 --> 57:16.365
but it kind of is, isn't it?

57:17.234 --> 57:18.500
What are you up to?

57:18.536 --> 57:20.202
- Actually, I was
looking for you.

57:20.237 --> 57:22.704
I wanted to show you something.

57:22.740 --> 57:23.806
- [Ruth] What's this?

57:24.809 --> 57:27.709
- It's a business plan
for my expansion idea.

57:27.745 --> 57:30.546
A retreat center for
summer camps and weddings,

57:30.581 --> 57:32.648
I sat down with the
accountant, ran the numbers,

57:32.683 --> 57:34.249
and we could do this.

57:34.285 --> 57:35.083
- Honey--
- It could work.

57:35.119 --> 57:37.119
- We've already
talked about this.

57:38.222 --> 57:39.121
- I know, I know,

57:39.256 --> 57:42.024
but I was hoping that
you would reconsider.

57:43.027 --> 57:45.194
We need this, we need
to look to the future

57:45.229 --> 57:47.362
to grow and diversify
if we're gonna thrive.

57:47.398 --> 57:50.098
- Look, I know that
you want to expand,

57:50.134 --> 57:52.167
but we are fine the way we are,

57:52.203 --> 57:54.837
the way we've
always done things.

57:54.872 --> 57:57.206
Preserving Aurora's legacy.

57:57.241 --> 58:00.175
- Her legacy was
questioning legacy.

58:00.211 --> 58:02.144
She'd want us to try.

58:04.448 --> 58:08.050
- I'm sorry, son.
(somber music)

58:09.887 --> 58:12.120
- [Woman] Stephanie,
you have our attention.

58:12.156 --> 58:15.424
- Thank you for meeting with me.

58:15.459 --> 58:19.595
I know you're interviewing
for the VP position,

58:19.630 --> 58:22.331
and I know you know
that I want it.

58:24.301 --> 58:28.303
But I realize I haven't
actually asked for it,

58:28.339 --> 58:32.107
so I'm asking now.

58:33.077 --> 58:36.111
I love this company,
I'm good at what I do,

58:37.281 --> 58:39.214
and I'm ready to
take the next step.

58:39.250 --> 58:41.049
I've always prided myself
on being able to find

58:41.085 --> 58:42.851
the right person
for the right job.

58:45.289 --> 58:46.588
And I'm the right person.

58:52.263 --> 58:53.495
- [Woman] So, tell us a
little about your ideas

58:53.531 --> 58:54.363
moving forward.

59:00.204 --> 59:01.103
- Hey.
- Hi.

59:01.138 --> 59:03.238
- I just got off the
phone with the board

59:03.274 --> 59:06.074
about the VP position, and
they are considering me.

59:06.110 --> 59:07.476
- Congratulations, oh!

59:09.613 --> 59:12.414
- (laughs) Thank you,
I am riding a bit
of a high right now.

59:12.449 --> 59:15.250
- Well, ride that high right
on over the mystery date,

59:15.286 --> 59:17.953
because everyone
is waiting for you.

59:17.988 --> 59:19.955
- Yeah, your expression
is kinda scaring me.

59:19.990 --> 59:21.890
What is the mystery date?

59:22.993 --> 59:24.993
Lisa, please tell me.

59:25.029 --> 59:26.528
I can keep a secret,
but you cannot.

59:26.564 --> 59:29.097
- Yes I can, I am great
at keeping secrets.

59:29.133 --> 59:32.034
- One, no you're not,
and two, I'm your friend.

59:32.069 --> 59:33.835
- You are my friend.
- Stephanie.

59:34.805 --> 59:37.839
Mystery date awaits, let's go.

59:39.343 --> 59:42.778
(gentle acoustic music)

59:47.585 --> 59:49.651
- [Oliver] Can you believe
only three more days?

59:49.687 --> 59:52.521
- You know, I'm sad to leave.

59:52.556 --> 59:54.389
- Yeah, me too.

59:54.425 --> 59:55.958
I'm gonna miss it.

59:55.993 --> 59:59.494
I finally find the sound of
crickets as soothing as sirens.

1:00:01.065 --> 1:00:03.532
So, what do you think our
mystery date's gonna be?

1:00:03.567 --> 1:00:05.400
- I don't know, I was
hoping for a spa day,

1:00:05.436 --> 1:00:07.302
but we're on a ranch in
the middle of nowhere,

1:00:07.338 --> 1:00:08.537
I think that's kinda unlikely.

1:00:08.572 --> 1:00:13.508
- Well, maybe a mud bath.

1:00:13.544 --> 1:00:14.309
Wow.

1:00:18.515 --> 1:00:20.315
(Stephanie stammers)

1:00:20.351 --> 1:00:21.116
What's wrong?

1:00:23.253 --> 1:00:24.653
- I'm afraid of heights.

1:00:25.789 --> 1:00:27.489
- Oh, that doesn't go that high.

1:00:28.492 --> 1:00:33.528
- No, um, I get shaky on
a ladder, so. (exhales)

1:00:41.071 --> 1:00:41.870
- Hey.

1:00:44.241 --> 1:00:47.342
Oh hey, it'll be
fine, I promise.

1:00:47.378 --> 1:00:50.178
Look, this is
perfectly safe, right?

1:00:50.214 --> 1:00:51.346
- Of course.
- Right.

1:00:52.149 --> 1:00:53.915
- I'm sorry, I can't.

1:00:53.951 --> 1:00:56.551
- Oh hey, there's
nothing to be scared of.

1:00:56.587 --> 1:00:58.220
You just have to
get over your fear.

1:00:58.255 --> 1:00:59.254
- [Stephanie] Oliver.

1:00:59.289 --> 1:01:00.622
- [Oliver] Yeah?

1:01:00.658 --> 1:01:03.458
- I don't think
that's how it works,

1:01:03.494 --> 1:01:06.728
I don't think you just
get over your fear.

1:01:06.764 --> 1:01:09.931
I'm really sorry, I have to go.

1:01:09.967 --> 1:01:13.568
(somber instrumental music)

1:01:20.944 --> 1:01:23.712
(Stephanie gasps)

1:01:23.747 --> 1:01:25.480
- The hot air balloon ride?

1:01:25.516 --> 1:01:28.784
- Yes, you knew about it?

1:01:28.819 --> 1:01:30.285
- They asked where they
could park their cars,

1:01:30.320 --> 1:01:32.387
and I told them that you
were afraid of heights.

1:01:32.423 --> 1:01:34.956
- Well, I'm pretty sure
that was part of it.

1:01:34.992 --> 1:01:36.091
Makes for good TV.

1:01:36.193 --> 1:01:41.396
Unfortunately, I, I only
made it as far as the basket.

1:01:42.966 --> 1:01:45.300
- Ah, listen, I wanna take
some photos of the balloon

1:01:45.335 --> 1:01:48.570
for the website to add to
a list of local activities.

1:01:48.605 --> 1:01:49.938
Wanna take a walk?

1:01:52.176 --> 1:01:53.442
- Yes.
- All right.

1:01:56.447 --> 1:01:58.246
I've never been in
a balloon before.

1:01:58.282 --> 1:01:59.414
- [Stephanie] I thought
you were gonna ask me

1:01:59.450 --> 1:02:00.415
to get in there for the photos.

1:02:00.451 --> 1:02:01.750
- (laughs) No.

1:02:01.785 --> 1:02:05.120
I mean, I'm not not
afraid of balloons,

1:02:05.155 --> 1:02:07.923
but I'm definitely afraid
of falling out of one.

1:02:11.328 --> 1:02:12.694
Do you mind if I
take some photos?

1:02:12.730 --> 1:02:13.929
- [Man] Go right ahead.

1:02:16.533 --> 1:02:19.067
I have always wanted to
up in a hot air balloon.

1:02:20.571 --> 1:02:23.171
Sure you don't wanna go?

1:02:23.207 --> 1:02:25.674
- It's not that I don't
wanna go, I want to go.

1:02:27.411 --> 1:02:28.844
- Is there anything
I can say to help?

1:02:28.879 --> 1:02:30.812
- I'm not sure, I
mean I know logically,

1:02:30.848 --> 1:02:34.282
there's nothing to be afraid of.

1:02:34.318 --> 1:02:35.484
- I wasn't gonna say that.

1:02:35.519 --> 1:02:37.185
- What were you gonna say?

1:02:38.555 --> 1:02:40.555
- I was gonna say that
fear might not go away,

1:02:40.591 --> 1:02:42.424
you might have to do it afraid.

1:02:47.931 --> 1:02:52.134
Or I could say nothing at
all and just hold your hand.

1:02:58.675 --> 1:03:01.977
(midtempo country music)

1:03:08.018 --> 1:03:08.817
- Oh!

your fear of heights?

1:03:38.482 --> 1:03:39.347
- It helps with remembering

1:03:39.449 --> 1:03:42.417

afraid of heights.

(gentle guitar music) -

1:05:04.768 --> 1:05:05.600
- It looks great out here.

1:05:05.736 --> 1:05:08.570
- I know, well this
is all Ruth, right?

1:05:08.605 --> 1:05:10.805
- No hey, I made some
of these garlands.

1:05:10.841 --> 1:05:12.240
The misshapen ones, of course.

1:05:12.276 --> 1:05:13.541
(Stephanie laughs)
(Oliver laughs)

1:05:13.577 --> 1:05:16.912
I can't believe our
last date is tomorrow.

1:05:16.947 --> 1:05:17.746
- Yeah.

1:05:17.781 --> 1:05:18.713
- Yeah, I know
these past two weeks

1:05:18.749 --> 1:05:23.919
haven't gone exactly as
we expected or hoped.

1:05:23.954 --> 1:05:25.687
But I'm really glad I met you.

1:05:27.591 --> 1:05:28.356
- Me, too.

1:05:29.559 --> 1:05:32.594
- Oliver, you're supposed to
be helping to set up the games.

1:05:32.629 --> 1:05:33.728
- Yeah, Oliver.
- Okay, I'm--

1:05:33.764 --> 1:05:35.897
- Go on, get.
- I'm going, I'm going.

1:05:35.933 --> 1:05:38.934
(Stephanie giggles)

1:05:42.706 --> 1:05:44.739
(Ruth sighs)
- You okay?

1:05:44.775 --> 1:05:45.974
- Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.

1:05:47.210 --> 1:05:50.979
Tomorrow marks 31 years that
I've been running this ranch.

1:05:51.014 --> 1:05:54.683
You know, I remember perfectly
the Founder's Day dance

1:05:54.718 --> 1:05:56.918
where my mom stood
up and announced

1:05:56.954 --> 1:06:01.122
that I was taking over, ah.

1:06:02.192 --> 1:06:05.460
And now, I know it's time
to pass the baton to Alex.

1:06:05.495 --> 1:06:09.931
He loves this place, and
he has so many, well,

1:06:09.967 --> 1:06:11.566
interesting ideas.

1:06:13.236 --> 1:06:18.073
Yeah, but, this is all
I've ever known, you know?

1:06:20.510 --> 1:06:24.813
It's not only my
livelihood, it's who I am.

1:06:25.749 --> 1:06:27.315
It's my identity.

1:06:28.919 --> 1:06:32.020
I'm a rancher, a
mother, and a wife.

1:06:37.761 --> 1:06:38.626
I'm scared.

1:06:40.397 --> 1:06:42.831
- Well, I heard that
Aurora was scared as well.

1:06:47.070 --> 1:06:48.136
- Yeah.

1:06:49.106 --> 1:06:50.905
(phone buzzes)

1:06:50.941 --> 1:06:52.607
Oh no, oh get it, please.

1:07:02.419 --> 1:07:03.551
- Mm.

1:07:03.587 --> 1:07:05.720
- What, good news?

1:07:05.756 --> 1:07:10.792
- Yeah, yeah, I got the
promotion that I really wanted.

1:07:11.261 --> 1:07:12.260
- What?
- Yeah.

1:07:12.295 --> 1:07:14.729
Congratulations, oh!

1:07:14.765 --> 1:07:16.398
That's so amazing.

1:07:16.433 --> 1:07:17.932
- Thank you.

1:07:17.968 --> 1:07:20.101
Well, you know, and I actually
have your son, in part,

1:07:20.137 --> 1:07:21.236
to thank.

1:07:21.371 --> 1:07:23.571
He's the one who encouraged
me to ask for what I wanted

1:07:23.607 --> 1:07:25.040
even if it was scary.

1:07:26.977 --> 1:07:28.376
- He's a good one.

1:07:30.213 --> 1:07:31.012
- Yeah.

1:07:33.083 --> 1:07:34.182
Yeah, he is.

1:07:34.217 --> 1:07:37.652
(gentle acoustic music)

1:07:40.457 --> 1:07:41.222
Alex?

1:07:44.895 --> 1:07:45.693
Alex?

1:07:49.166 --> 1:07:49.998
Huh.

1:07:51.668 --> 1:07:53.735
(somber instrumental music)

1:07:53.770 --> 1:07:55.370
- You've been riding.

1:07:55.405 --> 1:07:57.806
You've been riding,
I know you have.

1:07:57.841 --> 1:08:00.075
You're too good,
there's no rust on you.

1:08:02.979 --> 1:08:06.081
Beans for lunch, but.
(Kelly laughs)

1:08:06.116 --> 1:08:07.115
It was a little, I mean.

1:08:08.085 --> 1:08:11.386
(passersby chattering)

1:08:14.124 --> 1:08:15.123
- Hey.
- Hey.

1:08:15.158 --> 1:08:16.424
- [Stephanie] What's goin' on?

1:08:16.460 --> 1:08:18.093
- We're setting up
for your last date.

1:08:19.362 --> 1:08:20.195
- Right, yeah.

1:08:21.131 --> 1:08:22.197
- What's wrong?

1:08:23.200 --> 1:08:24.999
- I just saw Kelly and Alex.

1:08:25.035 --> 1:08:27.168
- Steph, there's nothing
going on between them.

1:08:27.204 --> 1:08:28.103
- Maybe there is?

1:08:28.138 --> 1:08:29.404
Maybe there could be.

1:08:29.439 --> 1:08:32.140
Kelly has feelings for
Alex, we know that,

1:08:32.175 --> 1:08:34.309
and maybe Alex could
have feelings for Kelly.

1:08:34.344 --> 1:08:36.244
Maybe he does have
feelings for Kelly,

1:08:36.279 --> 1:08:39.547
and he's scared to express them.

1:08:40.984 --> 1:08:43.284
Kelly's going to be working
here and living here,

1:08:43.320 --> 1:08:45.153
so they make sense.

1:08:45.188 --> 1:08:47.789
- Love is not about sense.

1:08:47.824 --> 1:08:49.124
- What's it about, nonsense?

1:08:49.159 --> 1:08:50.258
- This is what you always do.

1:08:50.293 --> 1:08:52.627
You second-guess yourself
and you psych yourself out

1:08:52.662 --> 1:08:54.662
because you're scared
of taking a chance

1:08:54.698 --> 1:08:56.297
and possibly getting hurt.

1:08:56.333 --> 1:08:59.367
This is what you did when Matt
first started to pull away.

1:08:59.402 --> 1:09:01.136
You just gave up.

1:09:01.171 --> 1:09:03.438
- Well, and I made
the best decision.

1:09:03.473 --> 1:09:06.407
Matt is ending up with the
person he's supposed to be with.

1:09:08.311 --> 1:09:09.110
Right?

1:09:10.247 --> 1:09:13.248
(somber guitar music)

1:09:16.653 --> 1:09:17.852
- Hey, Alex.
- Yeah?

1:09:17.888 --> 1:09:19.554
- The fan in our
cabin isn't working.

1:09:19.589 --> 1:09:20.688
Would you mind taking a look?

1:09:20.724 --> 1:09:22.457
- Yeah sure, no problem.
- Thanks.

1:09:34.938 --> 1:09:36.671
- [Narrator] This season,
we double the romance

1:09:36.706 --> 1:09:37.906
when Stephanie has to pick

1:09:37.941 --> 1:09:40.341
between two very
different bachelors.

1:09:43.580 --> 1:09:45.079
Will it be Stephanie and Alex

1:09:45.115 --> 1:09:47.448
or will it be
Stephanie and Oliver?

1:09:48.885 --> 1:09:50.818
Which bachelor will
win Stephanie's heart?

1:09:50.854 --> 1:09:53.788
Who will she pick as the one?

1:09:56.459 --> 1:09:58.459
- So who do you think
she's gonna pick?

1:10:00.130 --> 1:10:01.129
- Alex.

1:10:14.711 --> 1:10:16.044
- Hi.

1:10:16.079 --> 1:10:16.978
- Was it your idea?

1:10:18.215 --> 1:10:19.180
- Uh, what?

1:10:19.216 --> 1:10:20.582
- For me to be on the show?

1:10:21.985 --> 1:10:24.285
- I, I don't understand.

1:10:24.321 --> 1:10:25.420
- On The One,

1:10:25.522 --> 1:10:28.223
was this some kind of setup
for ratings, or whatever?

1:10:28.258 --> 1:10:29.724
- Okay, I'm genuinely
confused right now.

1:10:29.759 --> 1:10:31.626
- I am a bachelor on the show.

1:10:31.661 --> 1:10:32.894
- No, you're not.

1:10:32.929 --> 1:10:35.296
- Yes, I am, I just
saw the title sequence.

1:10:35.332 --> 1:10:37.732
You're supposed to be
choosing between and Oliver.

1:10:39.936 --> 1:10:41.069
- I, what?

1:10:43.306 --> 1:10:44.072
- You really didn't know?

1:10:44.107 --> 1:10:45.240
- No, of course I don't.

1:10:48.111 --> 1:10:49.944
You don't believe me.

1:10:49.980 --> 1:10:50.778
- I don't know.

1:10:53.350 --> 1:10:54.482
- You think I would lie to you?

1:10:54.517 --> 1:10:56.751
You think I would trick you,
you think that's who I am?

1:10:56.786 --> 1:10:58.353
- I don't know who you are.

1:11:01.758 --> 1:11:03.024
- Wow, okay, um.

1:11:04.194 --> 1:11:05.927
You're right, you
don't know who I am,

1:11:05.962 --> 1:11:09.430
and I don't know who
you are, we just met,

1:11:11.501 --> 1:11:15.403
and maybe there was
a flirtation or,

1:11:16.873 --> 1:11:17.972
but it's not gonna go anywhere

1:11:18.074 --> 1:11:21.843
because I am leaving and you
belong with someone else.

1:11:21.878 --> 1:11:22.944
- Stephanie--

1:11:22.979 --> 1:11:24.712
- No, it's, it's fine.

1:11:26.816 --> 1:11:31.653
We're just two strangers who
have only known each other

1:11:31.688 --> 1:11:32.620
a couple weeks.

1:11:34.991 --> 1:11:36.124
- And we can never
be anything more

1:11:36.226 --> 1:11:39.494
because you don't believe in
that whole premise, do you?

1:11:40.797 --> 1:11:41.663
- I guess I don't.

1:12:00.684 --> 1:12:04.285
(lively instrumental music)

1:12:06.890 --> 1:12:11.893
(partygoers chatter)
(partygoers laugh)

1:12:14.698 --> 1:12:16.164
- How long are you gonna mope

1:12:16.199 --> 1:12:19.233
before you go and just
talk to Stephanie?

1:12:19.269 --> 1:12:21.302
- Honestly, probably forever.

1:12:22.339 --> 1:12:24.272
I can't stop thinking
about what she said to me,

1:12:24.307 --> 1:12:27.542
that I belong with someone else.

1:12:27.577 --> 1:12:29.377
What's that mean?

1:12:30.947 --> 1:12:34.048
Obviously she doesn't even
realize how I feel about her.

1:12:35.018 --> 1:12:36.784
- Of course she doesn't
realize how you feel about her

1:12:36.820 --> 1:12:38.319
because you've never told her.

1:12:39.889 --> 1:12:43.057
Listen, I get it, it's hard
putting yourself out there.

1:12:43.093 --> 1:12:46.928
It's like being on a high
wire and not having a net.

1:12:48.398 --> 1:12:50.331
And I don't wanna do it either.

1:12:52.068 --> 1:12:54.268
But you know what happens
when you don't do it?

1:12:55.338 --> 1:12:57.839
The worst thing, nothing.

1:12:59.442 --> 1:13:02.410
So go, tell Stephanie
how you feel.

1:13:08.084 --> 1:13:09.317
- I'm so sorry.

1:13:09.352 --> 1:13:10.918
- Don't apologize.

1:13:10.954 --> 1:13:12.387
- If I had known
what Donna was up to,

1:13:12.422 --> 1:13:13.621
I would never have allowed it.

1:13:13.656 --> 1:13:16.391
- It's not your
fault, and it's fine.

1:13:16.426 --> 1:13:17.458
Thank you.

1:13:18.962 --> 1:13:20.728
- Remember, you don't
have to do this last date.

1:13:20.764 --> 1:13:22.330
You could just walk away.

1:13:22.365 --> 1:13:25.066
- No, look, things didn't
end the way I had hoped,

1:13:25.101 --> 1:13:28.169
but I'm not gonna leave you
or the show high and dry.

1:13:28.204 --> 1:13:29.303
- I'll walk away, too.
(Stephanie laughs)

1:13:29.439 --> 1:13:31.906
I think I've had just about
enough reality for a while.

1:13:31.941 --> 1:13:32.940
- You love your job.

1:13:33.710 --> 1:13:34.542
Besides.

1:13:36.012 --> 1:13:39.313
I owe it to Oliver to be
standing there next to him,

1:13:39.349 --> 1:13:42.283
even if it's just to tell the
world we didn't find the one.

1:13:43.386 --> 1:13:45.119
- What about Alex?

1:13:45.155 --> 1:13:47.355
(somber orchestral music)

1:13:47.390 --> 1:13:48.756
- Yeah, um.

1:13:51.694 --> 1:13:52.960
I don't know.

1:13:54.697 --> 1:13:57.331
(phone beeps)

1:13:59.302 --> 1:14:00.101
Okay, go.

1:14:02.071 --> 1:14:03.304
It's all good.

1:14:07.377 --> 1:14:09.977
- I'll see ya out there.
- Mm-hm.

1:14:34.737 --> 1:14:38.172
(lively acoustic music)

1:14:39.843 --> 1:14:40.641
- Oliver.

1:14:42.111 --> 1:14:43.544
25 minutes until we start.

1:14:43.580 --> 1:14:44.378
- Okay.

1:14:47.884 --> 1:14:49.383
(sighs) I imagine this season

1:14:49.419 --> 1:14:51.385
must be a disappointment to you.

1:14:51.421 --> 1:14:52.587
- Not at all.

1:14:52.722 --> 1:14:55.890
My job is to help people fall
in love, and I did just that.

1:14:57.060 --> 1:14:58.526
Even if they're not
yet aware of it.

1:15:08.538 --> 1:15:10.004
- Try to loosen up a bit.

1:15:10.039 --> 1:15:13.241
This is just an organic
discussion about your feelings.

1:15:13.276 --> 1:15:15.276
- Yeah, oh, except
with the cameras

1:15:15.311 --> 1:15:17.345
and soon-to-be
millions of viewers.

1:15:17.380 --> 1:15:19.614
(group laughs)
- Exactly.

1:15:19.649 --> 1:15:22.717
So just try to relax.

1:15:22.752 --> 1:15:25.686
(Stephanie groans)

1:15:28.424 --> 1:15:29.757
- There you go.
- Okay.

1:15:33.296 --> 1:15:35.363
Stephanie, I think you're great,

1:15:35.398 --> 1:15:38.366
and I've loved
getting to know you.

1:15:39.502 --> 1:15:41.435
And I think it
wasn't just the show

1:15:41.471 --> 1:15:42.537
that brought us together,

1:15:42.572 --> 1:15:45.873
I think that maybe it was fate

1:15:47.076 --> 1:15:50.411
because being here
with you inspired me

1:15:50.446 --> 1:15:55.449
to rethink my feelings of
what love is and isn't.

1:15:57.487 --> 1:16:00.121
And being here made me
wonder if I got it all wrong,

1:16:00.156 --> 1:16:03.491
and there actually is
love at first sight,

1:16:03.526 --> 1:16:06.861
and soulmates, well.

1:16:09.365 --> 1:16:11.365
And I think we both
have found the one.

1:16:16.372 --> 1:16:19.073
Just not with each other.

1:16:19.108 --> 1:16:21.442
- (chuckles) Yeah.

1:16:22.345 --> 1:16:23.444
I think you're right.

1:16:27.016 --> 1:16:29.150
- (exhales) Well.

1:16:29.185 --> 1:16:33.521
(Stephanie laughs)
(Oliver laughs)

1:16:33.556 --> 1:16:35.189
I, I don't mean to be rude,

1:16:35.224 --> 1:16:36.524
but there's other
places we should be--

1:16:36.559 --> 1:16:37.625
- Yes, go.

1:16:40.897 --> 1:16:44.565
(gentle orchestral music)

1:16:51.307 --> 1:16:54.475

(Kelly laughing)

1:17:15.732 --> 1:17:18.032
(finger taps)
- Hello, hi.

1:17:19.535 --> 1:17:22.937
Hi, um, I'm just so happy
to have everyone here

1:17:22.972 --> 1:17:27.241
to celebrate Aurora
Ranch's centennial.

1:17:27.276 --> 1:17:31.879
(group applauds)
Yeah.

1:17:31.914 --> 1:17:35.016
Yeah, it's a very special
day for the community,

1:17:35.051 --> 1:17:40.054
and it's also a very
special day in our family.

1:17:40.990 --> 1:17:42.523
Alex, is there anything
that you wanna say?

1:17:44.727 --> 1:17:46.694
- Uh, big thank you to my mom

1:17:46.729 --> 1:17:48.896
for making this a
day to remember.

1:17:48.931 --> 1:17:52.566
How are you ever going to
outdo yourself next year?

1:17:52.602 --> 1:17:53.601
- I won't.

1:17:53.636 --> 1:17:55.202
That'll be your job.

1:18:00.076 --> 1:18:01.909
It is my pleasure
and honor and pride

1:18:05.148 --> 1:18:08.949
to announce that Alex will
be taking over for me.

1:18:09.652 --> 1:18:14.889
(group cheers)
(group applauds)

1:18:19.762 --> 1:18:21.462
- [Alex] Really, Mom?

1:18:21.497 --> 1:18:23.564
- The stage is all
yours now, sweetheart.

1:18:25.134 --> 1:18:25.933
- Uh.

1:18:28.137 --> 1:18:31.472
(gentle orchestral music)

1:18:31.507 --> 1:18:35.643
I am so honored to be
taking over the ranch

1:18:37.647 --> 1:18:41.415
and humbled to be
carrying on the legacy

1:18:41.451 --> 1:18:43.851
of such great women.

1:18:43.886 --> 1:18:47.888
women who taught me
strength and humility.

1:18:48.658 --> 1:18:50.691
- You're retiring?

1:18:50.727 --> 1:18:53.160
- Yep.
- Determination.

1:18:53.196 --> 1:18:56.097
- So does that mean you'll
finally come visit me in Miami?

1:18:57.633 --> 1:18:59.200
- I think so.

1:18:59.235 --> 1:19:03.738
- But most of all, women
who taught me how to love.

1:19:11.681 --> 1:19:14.548
And I wanna say an
extra special thank you

1:19:14.584 --> 1:19:17.451
to one very special woman,

1:19:18.488 --> 1:19:21.622
who taught me to go after
things that I want most.

1:19:26.662 --> 1:19:30.664
And I promise, no more
speeches, have fun.

she was scared to

1:20:26.789 --> 1:20:29.557

realistic or a fantasy.
