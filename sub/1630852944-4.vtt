WEBVTT

00:14.967 --> 00:16.700
Hey Kitty, where are you?
Hurry up!

00:24.033 --> 00:25.000
Nothing.

00:25.933 --> 00:28.000
Back door.

00:28.133 --> 00:30.567
And then we had to
line up in the playground,
like a fire drill.

00:30.700 --> 00:32.733
-Whose bag was it?
-Second year.

00:32.867 --> 00:34.767
Somebody saw it,
screamed "bomb" and that was it.

00:34.900 --> 00:36.167
Day was over.

00:36.300 --> 00:37.667
Anthony
and Valerie Gemmell,

00:37.800 --> 00:40.300
In accordance with
the Prevention of Terrorism Act

00:40.433 --> 00:42.267
2000 Section 41,

00:42.400 --> 00:44.033
I'm arresting you on suspicion

00:44.167 --> 00:46.300
of causing explosions
and endangering life.

00:46.433 --> 00:47.800
You do not have to say anything

00:47.933 --> 00:51.333
but it may harm your defence
if you do not mention...

01:00.600 --> 01:01.600
Just a siren.

01:03.533 --> 01:04.633
Unexploded bomb

01:04.767 --> 01:06.400
located in a bin outside

01:06.533 --> 01:07.967
Power it Out boxing gym.

01:26.333 --> 01:27.500
The barrier's stuck.

01:30.567 --> 01:31.567
What's going on?

01:32.867 --> 01:34.400
-Mum?
-It's alright, chick.

01:46.300 --> 01:47.267
I can't talk, Neil.

01:48.800 --> 01:49.800
Where are you?

01:49.933 --> 01:51.500
On campus. Trying to get out.

01:51.633 --> 01:53.933
-Sarah...
-Kitty's in the car.

01:54.067 --> 01:55.533
There's an unexploded bomb.

01:55.667 --> 01:57.100
Alleyway off Flintock Street.

01:57.633 --> 01:59.300
Shit.

01:59.433 --> 02:01.567
-Mum?
-Are you out?

02:01.700 --> 02:03.100
It's, it's all blocked.

02:03.233 --> 02:05.400
-Fuck sake!
-Have you seen it?

02:05.533 --> 02:07.433
-Have you seen the device?
-No.

02:07.567 --> 02:09.167
Report's come in
of a big margarine tub

02:09.300 --> 02:11.100
in a bin outside the boxing gym.

02:11.233 --> 02:13.533
Witnesses say
there's a whitish grey smoke.

02:14.167 --> 02:15.433
-Any smell?
-Yes.

02:16.133 --> 02:17.667
Bleach. Strong.

02:17.800 --> 02:20.433
Hydrogen peroxide.
If there's smoke,
it might have failed but...

02:20.567 --> 02:22.067
-Where are you?
-We've just picked up

02:22.200 --> 02:24.233
our two letter-writers
over in Tayport.

02:24.367 --> 02:25.767
So, unless they have
an accomplice,

02:25.900 --> 02:27.700
I don't think
they'd have had time
to plant it.

02:27.833 --> 02:29.733
-Have they got phones on 'em?
-What?

02:29.867 --> 02:31.767
Have you got their phones?

02:31.900 --> 02:33.067
-Why?
-It's too risky.

02:33.200 --> 02:34.500
They, they could ring
the bomb, Neil.

02:35.633 --> 02:36.800
I'll call you back.

02:36.933 --> 02:37.933
I've got his...

02:39.367 --> 02:41.100
This is DCI McKinven. Pull over!

02:44.600 --> 02:46.400
Get her phone! Hey!

02:47.933 --> 02:48.933
Where's the phone?

03:00.267 --> 03:02.267
Sarah, we got both phones.

03:02.400 --> 03:03.867
-We're out.
- Jesus Christ.

03:45.967 --> 03:47.067
Right. I've got it.

03:47.900 --> 03:49.133
SO-15 are on board.

03:49.267 --> 03:50.800
So we've got to get every diary.

03:50.933 --> 03:52.633
Every photograph.
Every shopping list.

03:52.767 --> 03:54.133
Let's see
if they wrote the letters.

03:54.267 --> 03:56.267
Then we grill them,
are there any more bombs
out there?

03:56.400 --> 03:57.833
I'll get the coffees in.

03:57.967 --> 03:58.967
It's gonna be a long night.

04:00.700 --> 04:02.967
With Dundee
residents living in fear...

04:03.100 --> 04:05.533
Police have made
two arrests in Tayport.

04:05.667 --> 04:07.333
Meanwhile, another device
has been found

04:07.467 --> 04:09.667
in an alleyway
near Tayside University.

04:09.800 --> 04:13.700
The device, which has
now been safely deactivated
by the bomb squad,

04:13.833 --> 04:15.133
failed to detonate

04:15.267 --> 04:17.767
and will be taken
to a specialist laboratory

04:17.900 --> 04:19.633
- for further investigation.
-Is that you?

04:19.767 --> 04:22.067
-Yep.
-Unconfirmed
eye witness reports

04:22.167 --> 04:24.267
described whitish-grey smoke...

04:24.400 --> 04:26.267
Coming from
the green council-owned bin

04:26.400 --> 04:29.300
outside city gym,
"Power It Out".

04:29.433 --> 04:31.867
The four storey building
was packed with members

04:32.067 --> 04:33.867
but all were evacuated
to safety,

04:34.067 --> 04:35.867
-with no casualties.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.567
Investigations are continuing

04:37.700 --> 04:38.967
into the incident

04:39.100 --> 04:40.800
and disruption
to the road network...

04:45.800 --> 04:47.367
-Thank you.

04:48.233 --> 04:49.200
Hey.

04:49.867 --> 04:51.433
Why are you so tiny?

04:51.567 --> 04:53.633
Can't you be a violin teacher

04:53.767 --> 04:55.967
or somebody who works
at the garden centre?

04:56.100 --> 04:58.867
-I'd really love that.
-I think we'd all love that.
Apart from Mum.

04:59.067 --> 05:00.200
Sorry everyone.

05:02.433 --> 05:05.233
Alright. Compromise.
Just don't go in tomorrow.

05:05.367 --> 05:07.300
Stay on the couch with me
and Dad can stay home

05:07.433 --> 05:09.700
and we can all watch TV
and eat crisps all day.

05:09.833 --> 05:11.900
-Absolutely not.

05:15.100 --> 05:16.300
No!

05:16.433 --> 05:18.067
-Don't answer it.

05:18.133 --> 05:20.367
-Hey.
-Bad time?

05:20.500 --> 05:24.467
-Mum?
-No sorry. I'm being wrestled
by a 15 year old.

05:24.600 --> 05:25.867
You alright?

05:26.067 --> 05:27.800
Yeah. All fine.

05:27.933 --> 05:29.600
Are you alright,
more to the point?

05:29.733 --> 05:33.100
-Yeah. We're fine.
-Get off the phone.

05:33.233 --> 05:35.667
-Sounds like it.
-Get off.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.400
-Talk tomorrow?
-Sure.

05:38.367 --> 05:39.367
Bye.

05:43.167 --> 05:46.367
We're getting it tested,
but I can see
the writing indentation.

05:46.500 --> 05:49.900
'White ethnocite'
is as clear as day
on the first blank page.

05:50.067 --> 05:52.200
We found it
in the Gemmill's flat.

05:52.333 --> 05:54.100
Any other chemicals?
Bomb-making gear?

05:54.233 --> 05:55.700
Nothing obvious.

05:55.833 --> 05:56.800
Something interesting.

05:57.733 --> 05:59.233
No broadband at their flat.

05:59.367 --> 06:02.067
-What?
-No computer, no laptop.

06:02.200 --> 06:05.267
Azra says,
there's no email address
buried in the dark web.

06:05.400 --> 06:07.400
They're completely analogue.

06:07.533 --> 06:09.100
So if they are controlling
an accomplice,

06:09.233 --> 06:11.267
a delivery rider maybe,
how are they doing it?

06:11.400 --> 06:12.400
There was one more thing.

06:13.400 --> 06:14.500
No family photographs.

06:15.867 --> 06:17.667
Nothing.

06:17.800 --> 06:19.533
Don't waste
too much time on the letters.

06:20.500 --> 06:21.767
We need to know about the bombs.

06:28.067 --> 06:29.100
Good evening Mrs Gemmell.

06:32.567 --> 06:33.567
Mrs Gemmell?

06:38.767 --> 06:39.767
Excuse me?

06:42.100 --> 06:44.067
Could you turn back around,
please Mrs Gemmell?

06:46.633 --> 06:48.067
-What was your role
in this, Mrs Gemmell?
-Boss.

06:49.167 --> 06:50.933
-Am I glad to see you?
-Gavin.

06:52.400 --> 06:54.233
-Where are we?
-Here.

06:54.367 --> 06:55.400
Mrs Gemmell?

06:57.500 --> 06:58.633
She won't
even look at him.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.633
Christ.

07:02.767 --> 07:05.167
I'm obliged to inform you,
this interview is being observed

07:05.300 --> 07:07.700
by Detective Superintendent
Gavin Blair

07:07.833 --> 07:10.100
and Detective Chief
Superintendent Tom McBride

07:10.233 --> 07:11.267
of SO- 15.

07:11.633 --> 07:12.800
SO-15?

07:12.933 --> 07:14.367
Counter terrorism to you.

07:15.133 --> 07:16.400
Big guns.

07:16.533 --> 07:19.333
Mr Gemmell. Are there
any more bombs out there?

07:22.267 --> 07:23.833
Who's been helping you
plant these bombs?

07:26.867 --> 07:28.500
How did you know
how to make these devices?

07:31.867 --> 07:33.067
Okay...

07:33.133 --> 07:35.167
We received
two anonymous letters

07:35.300 --> 07:36.733
claiming to have been written

07:36.867 --> 07:38.333
by the people responsible for

07:38.467 --> 07:41.067
planning and executing
the two Dundee explosions.

07:41.167 --> 07:43.667
As you know, there was
a match with your DNA
on one of the letters,

07:43.800 --> 07:45.433
bringing us to your address.

07:45.567 --> 07:46.967
What can you tell us
about those letters?

07:48.833 --> 07:50.067
Okay, let's see then.

07:51.367 --> 07:53.433
I'm gonna read out a passage
from the first letter.

07:53.567 --> 07:55.300
I'd like you to write down
what I say.

08:00.167 --> 08:01.900
This is a manifesto of race.

08:03.167 --> 08:04.167
One race.

08:05.567 --> 08:09.067
The Dundee we know
and love will be cleaner,

08:10.433 --> 08:11.533
more potent,

08:13.567 --> 08:14.567
more White.

08:17.067 --> 08:18.600
Despite
yesterday's arrests,

08:18.733 --> 08:21.400
police are asking people
to remain vigilant.

08:21.533 --> 08:23.233
More witness reports
of white smoke...

08:24.167 --> 08:25.233
You've got me thinking now.

08:26.500 --> 08:28.100
Are Mia and Lily going in today?

08:28.667 --> 08:29.667
No.

08:31.600 --> 08:33.933
Mum, it'll probably be fine.

08:34.067 --> 08:35.500
'Probably' doesn't quite work
for me.

08:36.633 --> 08:37.600
You're staying at home today.

08:40.233 --> 08:41.200
You look terrible.

08:42.167 --> 08:43.167
Thanks.

08:44.900 --> 08:47.367
I got
three hours sleep.

08:47.500 --> 08:49.400
Well, if you can call it sleep.

08:49.533 --> 08:51.600
Three hours lying down,
feeling sick to my stomach.

08:52.633 --> 08:53.633
Who are they?

08:54.367 --> 08:56.400
Vile, vitriolic racists

08:56.533 --> 08:58.433
that suck all air from a room.

09:06.100 --> 09:08.400
-Is that the unexploded bomb?
-Yup.

09:08.533 --> 09:09.667
I don't need to walk in
with you.

09:10.700 --> 09:13.067
-Good field trip?
-Productive.

09:13.200 --> 09:14.933
-Jean the Dean's looking
for you.
-Oh, good.

09:15.700 --> 09:16.700
Good.

09:18.533 --> 09:19.533
Kathy here?

09:20.067 --> 09:21.233
Not yet.

09:21.367 --> 09:22.633
She probably needed
the sleep.

09:23.567 --> 09:25.300
Pia cancelled her trip.

09:25.433 --> 09:28.633
Kathy's just broken,
not surprisingly.

09:28.767 --> 09:30.433
It all happened
while we were away.

09:30.567 --> 09:32.333
You should have seen her.

09:32.467 --> 09:35.133
So, we just need to be
really careful with her today.

09:36.067 --> 09:36.967
I bought chocolates.

09:42.067 --> 09:44.100
-There she is.
-Jean.

09:44.233 --> 09:46.433
I cast my eye
over the time allocation survey

09:46.567 --> 09:48.333
-and had a question.
-Of course.

09:48.467 --> 09:50.400
Santorini? A talk?

09:50.533 --> 09:52.533
Oh, the Forensic Science
Symposium?

09:52.667 --> 09:54.933
You were on the podium for,
what, an hour?

09:55.067 --> 09:56.400
Trip was six days.

09:56.533 --> 09:58.167
Day to get there.
Day to get back.

09:58.300 --> 10:01.200
-Conference was four days.
My talk was on day two.
-Right.

10:01.333 --> 10:04.667
So who paid
for you to be squirreled away
in a white, clifftop hotel

10:04.800 --> 10:05.800
for four days?

10:07.567 --> 10:10.367
It was money
earned through case work.

10:10.500 --> 10:12.767
A budget
that SIFA can draw from.

10:12.900 --> 10:14.933
It didn't come from your pot.

10:15.067 --> 10:18.800
You see? I'm getting to know
what you do and how you do it.

10:18.933 --> 10:20.833
See you later for bubbles
at the fundraiser!

10:31.000 --> 10:33.567
Hello.
Prof Finn McGuinness.

10:33.700 --> 10:35.233
Forensic Explosives Laboratory

10:35.367 --> 10:36.800
for Professor Sarah Gordon.

10:36.933 --> 10:38.600
Of course. Welcome!

10:38.733 --> 10:40.500
Here's your card.

10:40.633 --> 10:42.633
And you'll need the code
for the keypad.

10:42.767 --> 10:45.000
Down the corridor.
First door on the left.

10:45.133 --> 10:46.267
Lovely. Thank you.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.067
-I'm so glad they sent you.

10:57.533 --> 10:59.033
-Want to see a bomb?
-Sure thing.

11:00.767 --> 11:02.233
In your letter you mention

11:02.367 --> 11:03.767
the making and planting the bomb

11:03.900 --> 11:06.667
that exploded at the St Barnabus
church hall.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.233
You say it was your wife
who planted it.

11:08.967 --> 11:10.233
We've been through this.

11:10.733 --> 11:11.700
Tell me again.

11:12.767 --> 11:14.333
How did she get
to the church hall?

11:14.467 --> 11:16.700
I did it with help, of course.

11:16.833 --> 11:18.900
Our soldiers are everywhere.

11:19.067 --> 11:23.267
Together, we will sing our song
to the masses,
the masses will listen.

11:24.500 --> 11:26.500
We, the leaders of this army,

11:26.633 --> 11:30.333
are incubating a force
that has already inspired
so much.

11:31.333 --> 11:32.300
What you got on IT?

11:33.133 --> 11:34.967
There is no IT for these two.

11:35.100 --> 11:38.167
No email address.
No messaging apps
on their phones. Nothing.

11:38.300 --> 11:40.800
So, how are they instructing
this army of theirs, eh?

11:40.933 --> 11:42.767
They're lying about her
planting the bomb,

11:42.900 --> 11:44.867
so someone must have planted it
for them.

11:45.067 --> 11:46.100
That's what I thought.

11:46.233 --> 11:47.600
But then we got an ANPR

11:47.733 --> 11:49.933
on Anthony and Valerie's vehicle
near the church hall

11:50.067 --> 11:53.800
but it's an hour and 45 minutes
after the bomb went off.

11:53.933 --> 11:55.067
Nothing before.

11:55.200 --> 11:56.933
So, what were they doing there

11:57.067 --> 11:58.467
at 8:45 in the evening?

11:58.600 --> 11:59.700
After the explosion?

12:03.733 --> 12:06.267
You and your wife mention
'an army'?

12:06.400 --> 12:07.833
Will they continue
with your work?

12:07.967 --> 12:09.067
While you're both in custody?

12:09.533 --> 12:10.567
Of course.

12:12.767 --> 12:13.967
Are there bombs
planted now?

12:20.267 --> 12:21.300
Who helped you make this?

12:23.800 --> 12:26.333
It's a partly-detonated
bucket device.

12:26.467 --> 12:27.900
A third bomb in the campaign.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.167
You've told us
you're not working alone.

12:32.733 --> 12:34.200
DNA samples gone to the lab?

12:34.333 --> 12:36.333
Yep. And the CT scans are ready.

12:38.733 --> 12:42.433
Okay. The first head
we recovered from the loch.

12:42.567 --> 12:44.667
No sign of fracture. Or trauma.

12:44.800 --> 12:46.300
Male. Young adult.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.067
And our second, wrapped head.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.500
-On first glance?
-Male.

12:51.633 --> 12:54.167
Major trauma. Two impacts.
Blow to the front

12:54.300 --> 12:55.367
and then a blow to the back.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.133
Blunt force or sharp?

12:57.267 --> 12:59.700
-Blunt.
-Good. Which came first?

12:59.833 --> 13:00.967
How can anyone know that?

13:01.433 --> 13:02.567
Puppe's Law.

13:02.700 --> 13:05.067
First blow. The skull fractures.

13:05.133 --> 13:08.133
So, trace the fracture lines
coming from the centre point
of trauma.

13:08.767 --> 13:10.233
Then, second blow.

13:10.367 --> 13:11.833
The skull fractures,

13:11.967 --> 13:13.833
but no fracture lines
will cross the path
of the first.

13:13.967 --> 13:15.733
Hence we can usually tell,
which came first.

13:16.333 --> 13:17.567
-Wow!
-Next one.

13:36.900 --> 13:38.967
This was meant to cause
a lot of damage.

13:49.067 --> 13:50.500
Someone's stepped up
their game.

13:51.467 --> 13:52.433
Big time.

13:58.833 --> 14:01.167
Louise, could you get
this phone component
off to the lab

14:01.300 --> 14:03.367
for DNA and fingerprint
enhancement?

14:03.500 --> 14:05.400
And ask DCI McKinven
to come here.

14:05.533 --> 14:06.533
Of course.

14:17.933 --> 14:21.367
Louise? Wasn't there
a piece of gaffa tape
found near the first bomb.

14:21.500 --> 14:22.500
I'll go find a picture of it.

14:25.300 --> 14:26.967
Now let's see
what these two can tell us?

14:39.233 --> 14:41.133
Let's look at this head first.

14:41.267 --> 14:43.433
Wrapped. No body found.

14:47.500 --> 14:49.767
Two injury sites confirmed.

14:49.900 --> 14:51.600
Decapitation has occurred.

14:52.367 --> 14:53.533
Marks on the bone

14:53.667 --> 14:57.067
consistent with those left by
a cutting tool.

14:57.200 --> 15:00.667
Compared to this skull,
where we see no cutting marks,

15:00.800 --> 15:01.833
therefore in this case,

15:01.967 --> 15:05.367
natural disarticulation
has occurred.

15:05.500 --> 15:07.367
Head was found near the body.

15:07.500 --> 15:09.667
Confirmed as male. But younger.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.133
We've got some fusion

15:12.267 --> 15:13.200
on his femur.

15:13.333 --> 15:14.900
He was still growing.

15:15.067 --> 15:19.233
I'd say roughly aged
between 16 and 22.

15:19.367 --> 15:21.567
-So, came apart in the water?
-Yes.

15:21.700 --> 15:24.400
The differential decomposition
between the wrapped head

15:24.533 --> 15:25.933
and everything else indicates

15:26.067 --> 15:29.067
that these bones and skull,
all belong together

15:29.167 --> 15:30.833
This body
naturally disarticulated

15:30.967 --> 15:33.167
because it was in water
for so long.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.200
Given this was freshwater,
not salt,

15:35.333 --> 15:38.067
I'd put PMI
at five to 12 months.

15:39.433 --> 15:40.467
Now the wrapped head

15:40.600 --> 15:42.533
is something
completely different.

15:42.667 --> 15:45.867
The wrapping has provided
near perfect protection
from predation.

15:47.600 --> 15:48.833
There's something else here.

15:50.667 --> 15:53.267
A snake cut clean in half.

15:53.400 --> 15:54.500
Can't be many of those around.

16:08.733 --> 16:12.267
Fancy taking my place
on the SO-15
and FEL advisory meet this year?

16:13.900 --> 16:14.900
Oh my God,

16:15.067 --> 16:16.933
you will never live that down.

16:17.067 --> 16:19.700
My hands were so sweaty,
I couldn't press
the power point clicker.

16:22.233 --> 16:23.367
I'll go.

16:30.867 --> 16:32.167
I'm Finn.

16:32.300 --> 16:34.367
From the Forensic Explosives
Laboratory at Porton Down.

16:35.500 --> 16:37.067
DCI McKinven.

16:37.167 --> 16:39.767
-Sorry, we're just...
-Neil, Finn, Finn, Neil.

16:44.233 --> 16:46.133
It's a bucket bomb.
Homemade device,

16:46.267 --> 16:48.867
similar to that used in
the failed Parsons Green attack.

16:49.067 --> 16:50.100
A combination of flour

16:50.233 --> 16:51.667
and hydrogen peroxide
is the fuel,

16:51.800 --> 16:53.867
creating this
dough-like mixture.

16:54.067 --> 16:55.833
TATP is then placed in a tube

16:55.967 --> 16:57.200
and thrust in to the dough.

16:57.333 --> 16:59.533
Plus a vibrating phone component
and battery,

16:59.667 --> 17:02.267
which means the device
can be called up
from a standard phone.

17:02.400 --> 17:03.633
The vibration in the phone

17:03.767 --> 17:05.233
triggers the detonation.

17:05.367 --> 17:07.267
Which makes it possible
for the bomber
to leave the scene

17:07.400 --> 17:08.867
and detonate from afar.

17:09.067 --> 17:10.233
So why didn't it go off?

17:10.367 --> 17:12.400
TATP. The detonator.

17:12.533 --> 17:14.200
It burnt rather than exploded.

17:14.333 --> 17:15.933
It's an unstable chemical.

17:16.067 --> 17:17.267
A lot can go wrong.

17:17.400 --> 17:18.767
TATP has been used

17:18.900 --> 17:21.100
in many attacks in recent years.

17:21.233 --> 17:24.500
Including in devices
linked to Islamic extremism.

17:24.633 --> 17:27.267
-This isn't Islamic extremism.
-Sure?

17:27.400 --> 17:28.967
Can you rule it out?

17:29.100 --> 17:32.500
We can provide
a tentative identification
of peroxide brands.

17:32.633 --> 17:34.900
Sales of hydrogen peroxide
can trigger red flags

17:35.067 --> 17:38.133
and vendors have to report
odd purchasing patterns.

17:38.267 --> 17:40.067
One other thing. I'm,
I'm not a phone expert

17:40.200 --> 17:42.267
but to me this looks like
a Nokia.

17:42.400 --> 17:45.300
Cheap, available, anonymous,
no apps, no camera.

17:45.433 --> 17:48.100
We could maybe get
a serial number off this
and ID the phone.

17:48.233 --> 17:49.800
Thanks.

17:49.933 --> 17:52.667
Well, I can get Azra
to help me with that.

17:58.367 --> 17:59.667
A pocket full of rocks.

18:00.733 --> 18:02.533
That's your extra weight.

18:02.667 --> 18:04.900
Not just waterlogged.
Check the other pocket.

18:08.067 --> 18:09.067
Full of 'em.

18:13.067 --> 18:16.200
Okay, we've got a match
on the DNA database
for the wrapped head.

18:16.333 --> 18:18.667
A decapitated male body
with a snake tattoo

18:18.800 --> 18:20.300
was found 11 months ago,

18:20.433 --> 18:22.800
-on a beach near Pendower
Lighthouse in Cornwall.
-Wow!

18:22.933 --> 18:24.833
They're sending through
the CT scan of the body.

18:24.967 --> 18:27.733
Well, then. It's well-preserved.
Frozen perhaps.

18:27.867 --> 18:30.300
-What about our other remains?
-Nothing yet.

18:36.067 --> 18:37.400
How do you know him?

18:37.533 --> 18:38.967
-Phil?
-Finn?

18:41.100 --> 18:43.600
Known him for years.
We've worked
on research projects together.

18:44.167 --> 18:45.167
Right.

18:46.967 --> 18:49.400
Him being here makes it possible
for me to stay on the case.

18:49.800 --> 18:50.800
I know.

18:54.833 --> 18:56.700
I'm glad you're safe.

18:56.833 --> 18:59.433
Kitty heard your voice.
She said it sounded wobbly.

19:00.833 --> 19:01.900
Wobbly's right.

19:03.133 --> 19:04.167
I'm okay.

19:08.467 --> 19:09.467
Good.

19:16.967 --> 19:18.067
We are in broad daylight.

19:29.733 --> 19:31.067
I'm not playing games with you.

19:32.433 --> 19:33.433
No games.

19:52.900 --> 19:53.867
Azra.

19:54.600 --> 19:55.633
Where are you?

19:55.767 --> 19:57.767
I've got something
on Dundeats Riders.

19:57.900 --> 19:59.433
Just looking at the new bomb.

20:01.800 --> 20:02.967
I need you back here.

20:03.767 --> 20:04.967
You're gonna love this.

20:10.700 --> 20:11.800
Impressive, Azra.

20:12.767 --> 20:14.133
-Sorry, everyone.
-Finally.

20:14.267 --> 20:15.933
Were you locked up
in a high security lab?

20:17.133 --> 20:19.400
Right. We have results.

20:19.533 --> 20:23.167
Three food delivery companies
operating in Dundee.

20:23.300 --> 20:26.233
Dundeats, Chowcart
and Deliverdish.

20:26.367 --> 20:30.000
Four hundred and fifty
delivery riders in total.

20:30.133 --> 20:32.200
I've obtained names
and usernames

20:32.333 --> 20:34.533
for all riders
from the delivery companies.

20:34.667 --> 20:37.667
From there I searched
and recovered images

20:37.800 --> 20:39.833
for all riders
you didn't interview.

20:39.967 --> 20:41.467
Usual social media routes,

20:41.600 --> 20:43.700
but some were
from university blogs,

20:43.833 --> 20:45.433
some from Signal,

20:45.567 --> 20:47.300
Spotify profile pictures,

20:47.433 --> 20:49.867
uh, MyFitnessPal,
Amazon Wishlist, whatever.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.900
Everyone's got
a photograph online,

20:52.033 --> 20:53.400
even when they think they don't.

20:54.067 --> 20:55.467
Now, you will notice

20:55.600 --> 20:58.967
that some of the riders
are a green dot.

20:59.100 --> 21:02.067
Well, they work
for all three companies.

21:02.733 --> 21:04.500
Some are a blue dot.

21:04.633 --> 21:06.433
And they work for two companies.

21:06.567 --> 21:09.433
But 31 riders, the red dots,

21:09.567 --> 21:10.867
they just work

21:11.067 --> 21:12.400
for one company.

21:12.533 --> 21:13.800
Interestingly,

21:13.933 --> 21:16.300
those who only work
for only one company,

21:17.100 --> 21:18.633
only work for Dundeats.

21:18.767 --> 21:21.867
No one just works for Chowcart
or Deliverdish?

21:22.067 --> 21:24.533
Precisely. Here go on.
You can click it.

21:24.667 --> 21:25.833
Now it could be random.

21:26.433 --> 21:28.200
But, I thought,

21:28.333 --> 21:31.167
why would that be?
Who are these riders?

21:31.300 --> 21:32.567
What is it about Dundeats?

21:32.700 --> 21:34.100
We've met some of these guys.

21:34.233 --> 21:37.067
So go back to them.
Where are they? Who are they?

21:37.167 --> 21:38.833
Are the Gemmells
controlling them?

21:38.967 --> 21:41.133
Azra. This is incredible.

21:42.067 --> 21:44.067
Of the 31 riders,

21:44.167 --> 21:46.567
I've marked 17 with an L.

21:46.700 --> 21:48.800
All the Ls were logged on

21:48.933 --> 21:50.600
on the nights of the bombings.

21:50.733 --> 21:52.867
The bomber wouldn't log on.
That'd be the dumbest thing
he could do.

21:53.067 --> 21:54.233
Or the cleverest.

21:54.367 --> 21:56.300
Or they were just working?

21:57.067 --> 21:58.467
Some work all hours.

21:58.600 --> 22:00.400
Or maybe they're just loyal.

22:00.533 --> 22:02.233
They like working for Dundeats.

22:02.367 --> 22:06.800
Or maybe Dundeats
is the oldest company
and has the most lax security.

22:06.933 --> 22:08.933
All delivery companies,
nationally,

22:09.067 --> 22:12.067
are in the process of upgrading
their security protocol.

22:12.167 --> 22:14.967
Now, some systems have improved,

22:15.100 --> 22:17.133
but there are those riders
who signed up

22:17.267 --> 22:19.733
before those systems
were in place.

22:19.867 --> 22:22.800
So in a new company,
you can't get away with subbing

22:22.933 --> 22:24.967
-for instance.
-Subbing?

22:25.100 --> 22:26.867
It's when a rider

22:27.067 --> 22:29.267
loans out their log-in details.

22:29.400 --> 22:32.167
The named rider might not be
the actual rider.

22:32.300 --> 22:35.567
So how do we know
if any of these Dundeats riders
are who they say there are?

22:35.700 --> 22:37.800
-We don't.
-So, all this...

22:37.933 --> 22:39.700
Sorry to interrupt.

22:39.833 --> 22:42.567
Just got back from the school
where Valerie Gemmell
used to teach.

22:42.700 --> 22:45.133
Only she's not known there
as Mrs Gemmell.

22:45.267 --> 22:46.833
She's known as Mrs Callanach.

22:46.967 --> 22:49.200
Kept her ex-husband's name.
Continuity with the kids.

22:49.333 --> 22:50.733
-Mrs what?
-Callanach.

22:51.633 --> 22:52.633
Azra. Can I...

22:55.167 --> 22:56.467
I've just seen a Callanach.

22:57.533 --> 22:58.500
Come on.

23:00.067 --> 23:01.067
There.

23:02.333 --> 23:04.600
Christ. Is that her son?

23:05.933 --> 23:07.833
He's doing their dirty work
for them.

23:07.967 --> 23:09.867
There's your digital link.

23:10.067 --> 23:12.967
No wonder she denied
having a kid if she's protecting
her own son.

23:14.467 --> 23:15.433
Bring him in.

23:17.633 --> 23:21.200
Does the name
Rory Callanach mean anything
to you?

23:21.800 --> 23:23.067
No comment.

23:23.200 --> 23:25.700
Why did you deny the existence
of your son, Mrs Gemmell?

23:26.367 --> 23:27.300
No comment.

23:27.433 --> 23:29.067
Is it because your son,

23:29.133 --> 23:32.967
Rory Callanach
is the technological brain
of your little outfit?

23:33.100 --> 23:35.333
Allowing you and your husband
to be completely analogue?

23:36.567 --> 23:37.667
No comment.

23:40.867 --> 23:42.367
They haven't got the balls
to do this.

23:43.133 --> 23:44.767
-Admirable.
-What?

23:44.900 --> 23:46.833
Well, you protect them.
They protect you.

23:46.967 --> 23:48.100
I wouldn't protect him.

23:49.567 --> 23:51.667
-Why not?
-He's a racist dick.

23:51.800 --> 23:53.967
-And you're not? A racist?
-No.

23:55.367 --> 23:56.367
I'm not a racist.

23:57.067 --> 23:58.300
Okay.

23:58.433 --> 23:59.767
So, maybe it was Anthony's idea?

24:00.900 --> 24:02.267
Oh, he'd love the glory.

24:03.733 --> 24:05.867
Considers himself to be
an old school fascist.

24:06.067 --> 24:08.167
Educated. Erudite.

24:08.300 --> 24:10.067
'A gentleman'
from a previous time.

24:11.733 --> 24:13.167
She has,

24:13.300 --> 24:15.067
for reasons nobody understands,

24:15.167 --> 24:17.067
taken on his poison.

24:17.167 --> 24:18.600
When was the last time
you saw your mum?

24:19.233 --> 24:20.233
I don't know.

24:21.867 --> 24:22.967
Summer before last?

24:24.500 --> 24:25.867
Her birthday, I think.

24:26.700 --> 24:28.067
I had a row with Anthony.

24:28.167 --> 24:30.067
It all kicked off. That was it.

24:32.367 --> 24:34.867
Rory, we're searching your flat.

24:36.333 --> 24:37.567
You're quite techy.

24:37.700 --> 24:39.267
We've already picked up
all sorts.

24:39.400 --> 24:42.433
Two laptops. Hard drives.

24:42.567 --> 24:45.333
Your mother and step father
don't even own a computer.

24:45.467 --> 24:46.733
You think that's where
I come in?

24:46.867 --> 24:48.233
It's a convenient estrangement.

24:49.533 --> 24:51.333
My mother doesn't want to
know me, Detective.

24:51.900 --> 24:53.700
Why would she?

24:53.833 --> 24:55.400
She knows her husband
makes my skin crawl.

24:55.533 --> 24:57.200
We have a CCTV image

24:57.333 --> 24:58.667
of a Dundeats delivery rider

24:58.800 --> 25:01.200
close to two of the bomb sites.

25:01.333 --> 25:03.500
-It wasn't me.
-You were logged on
all three nights.

25:03.633 --> 25:05.967
I was just doing my job.

25:06.100 --> 25:09.500
Delivering fried chicken
to a bloke in a static caravan
out at Kilmany.

25:09.633 --> 25:11.500
Five nights on the trot.
I was there every night.

25:13.067 --> 25:14.067
He was a big tipper.

25:16.733 --> 25:18.200
I'm no bomber, Detective.

25:19.633 --> 25:21.567
I work for a living. That's it.

25:22.833 --> 25:24.267
I mean, it's harsh.

25:24.400 --> 25:26.067
There's no care. No loyalty.

25:27.533 --> 25:28.533
It's lonely.

25:30.700 --> 25:33.367
No real connection with anyone.

25:35.967 --> 25:36.967
But it does the job.

25:39.133 --> 25:40.100
It pays the rent.

25:41.767 --> 25:43.367
His alibi checks out.

25:43.500 --> 25:45.733
He was out at Kilmany
every night.

25:45.867 --> 25:49.067
Rory Callanach wasn't anywhere
near the bomb sites.

25:49.200 --> 25:52.400
And there's nothing
on his laptops
to suggest any contact

25:52.533 --> 25:55.300
between Valerie and Anthony
in recent months.

25:55.433 --> 25:57.733
Last phone call to Valerie
was on her birthday,

25:57.867 --> 25:58.933
19 months ago.

25:59.067 --> 26:00.233
He's telling
the truth.

26:00.367 --> 26:02.433
The Dundeats thing,
it's a coincidence.

26:02.567 --> 26:04.700
He was horrified.
To have any of this
levelled at him.

26:04.833 --> 26:06.067
There's nothing
at his flat.

26:06.133 --> 26:07.900
No bomb-making gear. No bleach.

26:08.067 --> 26:09.133
Hydrogen Peroxide.

26:09.267 --> 26:10.733
Does that rule him out
of making the bomb?

26:11.600 --> 26:12.733
I can't confirm that.

26:12.867 --> 26:14.167
What can you tell us?

26:14.300 --> 26:16.067
Only that the device
is more sophisticated,

26:16.167 --> 26:17.533
but there are parts
that didn't seem to work,

26:17.667 --> 26:18.800
which suggests some

26:18.933 --> 26:20.500
lack of knowledge
by the bomb maker.

26:20.633 --> 26:22.567
If it had worked,
it would have caused
loss of life.

26:22.700 --> 26:26.333
But, I can't tell you who did
or didn't make them.

26:26.467 --> 26:28.967
Charge them
and get on with finding
the real bombers.

26:30.500 --> 26:32.667
You,
Anthony Gemmell...

26:32.800 --> 26:35.067
Valerie Gemmell,
whilst acting together

26:35.133 --> 26:37.467
in a racially
aggravating manner,
which caused...

26:37.600 --> 26:39.067
... or was intended
to cause

26:39.167 --> 26:41.467
alarm and distress
to the general public

26:41.600 --> 26:43.700
are charged
with wasting police time.

26:46.167 --> 26:48.467
We dropped the ball
focussing on those two.

26:48.600 --> 26:50.667
We had to see that through.

26:50.800 --> 26:54.133
-They weren't nothing.
-Aye, I know. I didn't mean...

26:54.267 --> 26:55.267
I know. I know.

26:59.867 --> 27:01.467
I look at my baby

27:01.600 --> 27:03.700
and feel this quiet dread.

27:04.167 --> 27:05.867
This nausea.

27:06.067 --> 27:07.933
Of what kind of hate's
gonna come her way.

27:09.633 --> 27:10.933
But you're right.

27:11.067 --> 27:13.967
Our bomber has had two days
with no-one on their back.

27:16.200 --> 27:17.800
And they'll have been busy,
I promise you.

27:23.233 --> 27:25.133
Never really
noticed them before.

27:25.267 --> 27:27.300
But now, everywhere I look,
there they are.

27:27.433 --> 27:28.433
It's uncanny.

27:29.600 --> 27:30.767
It's some life, isn't it?

27:30.900 --> 27:33.867
"No care. No loyalty. Lonely.

27:34.933 --> 27:36.500
No real connection
with anybody".

27:49.833 --> 27:52.800
So, Cornish police are coming up
to collect the tattooed head.

27:52.933 --> 27:54.433
Nothing more for us there.

27:54.567 --> 27:56.467
But we've got DNA back
on the other parts.

27:56.600 --> 27:57.900
Confirmed that they belong
together,

27:58.067 --> 28:00.467
but no ID flagged
on the DNA database.

28:02.967 --> 28:06.067
So, no one's missed this guy.
At all.

28:06.167 --> 28:07.733
Never reported. Nope.

28:08.767 --> 28:10.633
-Wow.
-Happens.

28:13.167 --> 28:15.367
We'll need to send
the CT of the skull
and mandible off

28:15.500 --> 28:16.667
for a facial reconstruction.

28:16.800 --> 28:17.900
Someone must know this guy...

28:19.133 --> 28:20.100
I hope.

28:22.400 --> 28:23.367
Do they match?

28:24.167 --> 28:25.133
Looks like they might, yes.

28:27.067 --> 28:30.067
It's good in theory.
But it's more of the same.

28:30.200 --> 28:32.533
The lab weren't able to recover
any fingerprints or DNA.

28:32.667 --> 28:34.067
And I'm getting nothing
at my end.

28:34.200 --> 28:36.733
Whoever made this bomb
was clean as a whistle.

28:47.300 --> 28:48.633
Send this off to the lab.

28:48.767 --> 28:52.200
If he tied this knot himself,
there may be hair in here.

28:52.333 --> 28:55.067
We can do some isotopic analysis
on his toe nails.

28:55.133 --> 28:56.900
Find out what he ate, drank.

28:57.067 --> 28:59.533
Where he lived
for the last six months
of his life.

28:59.667 --> 29:02.167
No shoe size marked,
but we've measured
size 11 feet.

29:09.667 --> 29:13.367
There's a small surgical scar
on the front of his left foot.
See?

29:13.500 --> 29:16.233
It's a bit of a long shot,
but we could try
medical records.

29:16.367 --> 29:18.233
We'll deal
with the rest of the body
in the morning.

29:18.367 --> 29:19.900
Much as I would prefer
to hang out with this guy,

29:20.067 --> 29:21.833
rather than stand around
with a bunch of suits

29:21.967 --> 29:23.467
and a chocolate fountain.

29:23.600 --> 29:26.267
-Come on. You might have
a good time.
-That's doubtful.

29:26.400 --> 29:28.267
Uniform just a found
a rucksack. Near the loch.

29:29.167 --> 29:30.633
A few personal effects in there.

29:30.767 --> 29:32.233
We're hoping for an ID.

29:32.367 --> 29:34.267
I'll put a call out
after Erika mentioned a bag.

29:34.767 --> 29:35.733
I knew it.

29:50.767 --> 29:51.767
Where is she?

30:09.033 --> 30:10.033
Kathy?

30:18.033 --> 30:21.033
Don't make me go out there.
It's full of veneer.

30:24.033 --> 30:26.133
What are you wearing?
It's a fundraiser.

30:26.267 --> 30:27.400
Excuse me?

30:27.533 --> 30:28.500
Sorry, I didn't mean...

30:28.633 --> 30:29.833
Oh, you didn't mean,
"a better outfit

30:29.967 --> 30:31.733
would help deliver
the library funding deficit?"

30:31.867 --> 30:33.800
You know what I meant.
Why are you so cross?

30:36.200 --> 30:37.567
Pia's not coming over.

30:37.700 --> 30:38.767
What?

30:38.900 --> 30:41.433
She cancelled. Changed her mind.
Met someone.

30:41.567 --> 30:43.267
Oh God, I'm sorry.

30:44.067 --> 30:45.533
That's so disappointing.

30:45.667 --> 30:47.467
-Don't be sorry.
-I'm.

30:48.633 --> 30:50.967
I'd heard you needed some TLC.

30:51.100 --> 30:53.267
-Janine picked something
up from Erika.
-What?

30:54.333 --> 30:56.867
Janine was very discreet.
I promise.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.800
Erika told Janine?

30:58.933 --> 31:01.767
Erika wants to be privy
to all your bells and whistles.
Of course she does.

31:01.900 --> 31:05.200
She's, she's a PhD student.
She thinks you're superhuman.

31:05.333 --> 31:07.300
Bigger question is,
why are you discussing
your love life

31:07.433 --> 31:08.600
with Erika on a field trip?

31:20.900 --> 31:22.267
You have got to be kidding me.

31:26.633 --> 31:30.367
Beaming live via
our School of Science Media Hub

31:30.500 --> 31:32.933
I welcome you all here
this evening.

31:33.067 --> 31:35.933
To our universe
of scientific brilliance.

31:36.067 --> 31:38.833
Where we cater for thunderbolts
and lightning strikes

31:38.967 --> 31:40.833
every day of the week.

31:40.967 --> 31:42.567
We're here to thank you,

31:42.700 --> 31:44.267
our generous sponsors,

31:44.400 --> 31:48.700
for getting us to a place
where we're only
17,000 pounds away

31:48.833 --> 31:51.400
from commencing work
on our state of the art,

31:51.533 --> 31:53.433
School of Science library.

31:53.567 --> 31:55.900
A world class facility,

31:56.067 --> 31:59.567
feeding the brilliant
young scientific minds,

31:59.700 --> 32:02.367
and giving them the space
and nourishment

32:02.500 --> 32:04.167
they need to flourish.

32:04.933 --> 32:06.967
And we don't stop there.

32:07.100 --> 32:09.367
I'm also proud
to announce tonight,

32:09.500 --> 32:12.400
my vision
for a new undergraduate course

32:12.533 --> 32:14.133
in Forensic Science.

32:14.800 --> 32:16.200
Funded by you,

32:16.333 --> 32:19.100
under the stewardship
of Professor Kathy Torrance

32:19.233 --> 32:22.933
and Director of SIFA,
Professor Sarah Gordon,

32:23.067 --> 32:26.067
a scientist able to sprinkle
her pixie dust

32:26.167 --> 32:28.267
on everything she touches.

32:28.800 --> 32:30.133
So here she is,

32:30.267 --> 32:32.867
to say a few words
about our shared vision

32:33.067 --> 32:35.333
and the work that SIFA do.

32:35.467 --> 32:37.600
Professor Sarah Gordon.

32:37.733 --> 32:39.167
-Did you approve that?
-Nope.

32:45.200 --> 32:46.233
Good evening.

32:46.367 --> 32:48.533
Thank you, Jean,
for your kind words.

32:49.767 --> 32:52.700
Since her arrival,
Jean has been a champion

32:52.833 --> 32:54.367
of our work here at SIFA.

32:54.500 --> 32:56.067
She's already proved herself
to be someone

32:56.167 --> 32:57.933
who can set her own strategy,

32:58.067 --> 32:59.267
as well as having
an understanding

32:59.400 --> 33:02.367
that we're not easy,
us academics.

33:02.500 --> 33:04.233
Like a duck to water.

33:04.367 --> 33:05.367
Thank you, Jean.

33:11.967 --> 33:13.200
-You alright?
-Mmm-hmm.

33:14.167 --> 33:15.167
Come in, sit.

33:15.300 --> 33:17.500
I'll leave you to it.

33:17.633 --> 33:20.067
Come on, grab a glass.
It's a good bottle.

33:21.633 --> 33:22.967
I'm alright. Thanks.

33:23.833 --> 33:25.633
-It was great day.
-Aye.

33:25.767 --> 33:27.267
You did well.

33:27.400 --> 33:28.867
Did you look at me, and think...

33:29.067 --> 33:30.100
there she is,

33:30.833 --> 33:31.900
I'm married to her?

33:32.633 --> 33:33.867
I did.

33:34.067 --> 33:35.300
What did Super say?

33:35.433 --> 33:37.800
Hmm, I think
they're all a bit in love.

33:39.400 --> 33:40.367
I need to work.

33:43.267 --> 33:45.600
And now I have pleasure
of introducing my

33:45.733 --> 33:47.767
and one of the world's leading

33:47.900 --> 33:49.067
Forensic Anthropologists,

33:49.900 --> 33:51.167
Professor Kathy Torrance.

34:03.333 --> 34:04.333
Good evening.

34:05.867 --> 34:07.133
Space looks good.

34:07.267 --> 34:09.533
Especially the fairy lights.
Must be the pixie dust.

34:10.933 --> 34:12.167
Wow, Jean.

34:12.300 --> 34:14.067
I love that you think

34:14.133 --> 34:16.833
we're fighting the thunderbolts
and lightning strikes,
day in day out.

34:16.967 --> 34:18.967
But I may need to clear
something up there.

34:20.533 --> 34:22.533
As a scientist,

34:22.667 --> 34:24.300
those thunderbolts,
they do come.

34:24.433 --> 34:26.700
But every 30 years.

34:26.833 --> 34:28.667
So what do we do
in the mean time? Well...

34:29.967 --> 34:31.733
It's pretty uneventful.

34:31.867 --> 34:33.833
Spark-free zone.

34:33.967 --> 34:37.767
We focus on chemical
and biological analysis.

34:37.900 --> 34:39.700
We find out what evidence means.

34:40.667 --> 34:42.300
We look for ways to read "data",

34:42.433 --> 34:44.367
interpret results,
write our report

34:44.500 --> 34:45.667
and sometimes

34:45.800 --> 34:48.567
present and communicate
our evidence in court.

34:48.700 --> 34:50.833
It's a little dry.
A little slow.

34:50.967 --> 34:52.267
But it is fantastic.

34:54.333 --> 34:56.467
So, there really is no
pixie dust.

34:56.600 --> 34:57.700
Just wanted to clear that up.

35:01.400 --> 35:03.133
And the library
is going to be amazing,

35:03.267 --> 35:04.800
so thanks for your money.
Good night.

35:10.267 --> 35:11.267
What was that?

35:16.133 --> 35:18.133
With the failure
of this latest device,

35:18.267 --> 35:21.400
has the Dundee bomber
been driven underground?

35:21.533 --> 35:24.767
Will the bombers ineptitude
lead to an arrest?

35:24.900 --> 35:28.567
Police are calling on members
of the public to come forward
with any information...

36:00.933 --> 36:01.933
Thanks.

36:04.067 --> 36:05.800
Is that an apology?

36:05.933 --> 36:08.833
Sarah, Jean stood up there
and misrepresented what we do.

36:08.967 --> 36:10.933
It wasn't the time or the place
to correct her.

36:11.067 --> 36:12.467
Couldn't let it go.

36:12.600 --> 36:15.333
-Well, I guess,
that's where you and I differ.
-Yeah.

36:15.467 --> 36:18.700
She doesn't know
anything about science!
Don't you find that bewildering?

36:18.833 --> 36:21.100
The Dean
of the School of Science?

36:21.233 --> 36:23.500
You don't like her.
And last night was a chance
to play that out.

36:23.633 --> 36:25.433
You undermined her
in front of the sponsors!

36:25.567 --> 36:26.967
It was deeply unprofessional.

36:29.500 --> 36:30.433
Sorry.

36:30.567 --> 36:31.633
-Are you?
-Yes!

36:33.333 --> 36:35.567
I kind of believe you.

36:35.700 --> 36:38.833
I'll fully believe you
when you apologise
to Jean as well.

36:38.967 --> 36:41.400
I tried already. She's off sick.
Too many bubbles.

36:42.600 --> 36:43.600
You made her sick.

37:22.067 --> 37:23.133
-Hey.
-Hey.

37:23.267 --> 37:25.067
For you. Product design
threw this together.

37:25.167 --> 37:28.600
This little pincer bit
is for removing tissue,
without disturbing the pigs.

37:28.733 --> 37:30.600
Great. Just what
we've been waiting for.

37:31.867 --> 37:33.267
-Kathy?
-Yeah?

37:34.167 --> 37:35.267
-You okay?
-Yeah.

37:36.367 --> 37:37.567
Hey.

37:37.700 --> 37:39.067
Loved your speech last night.

37:39.200 --> 37:42.133
No. You are in no position
to discuss

37:42.267 --> 37:44.267
anything you may have seen
or heard

37:44.400 --> 37:46.200
or understood to be true
while we were away.

37:46.333 --> 37:47.833
No position. Do you hear me?

37:49.500 --> 37:50.667
Never do it again.

38:11.833 --> 38:13.067
I'm coming for you, Holly.

38:22.067 --> 38:23.700
So, you are
our mystery body.

38:28.267 --> 38:29.267
Hello Euan.

38:30.533 --> 38:31.533
Hey.

38:33.233 --> 38:34.233
What?

38:36.233 --> 38:37.200
Do you recognise him?

38:39.067 --> 38:40.067
No.

38:40.167 --> 38:41.900
Nineteen, six foot two,

38:42.067 --> 38:43.667
size eleven feet, white male.

38:43.800 --> 38:45.067
We got all that right.

38:45.200 --> 38:46.567
Sorry, but...

38:46.700 --> 38:47.967
One of the bodies in the loch.

38:48.100 --> 38:49.433
School of Science. Physics.

38:49.567 --> 38:50.867
He went to this university.

38:51.067 --> 38:52.567
His name was Euan Macmillan.

38:52.700 --> 38:54.600
What? A student?

38:54.733 --> 38:56.933
Looks like he filled his pockets
full of rocks,

38:57.067 --> 38:58.267
tied his feet together

38:58.400 --> 39:00.967
and jumped into a fast-moving
mountain river.

39:01.100 --> 39:02.767
There'll be
a fatal accident enquiry.

39:02.900 --> 39:05.100
Do we know
anything about him? Why?

39:05.233 --> 39:06.200
Why did he kill himself

39:06.333 --> 39:08.067
or why did nobody
report him missing?

39:08.967 --> 39:10.433
According to Charlie,

39:10.567 --> 39:13.133
Euan told his Mum,
he was heading off grid
for a few months.

39:13.267 --> 39:14.733
He said he needed a break
from his course

39:14.867 --> 39:17.367
and was taking a sabbatical
from university.

39:17.500 --> 39:20.167
She said he'd travelled before.
He took off sometimes.

39:20.300 --> 39:22.500
He just liked to break
from the noise. The technology.

39:22.633 --> 39:25.767
He was that kind of kid.
So, she didn't report
him missing.

39:26.900 --> 39:29.333
But what did he tell
the university?

39:29.467 --> 39:31.167
Because this place
didn't report him
missing either.

39:31.300 --> 39:32.300
Why was that?

39:51.800 --> 39:52.800
Ten.

39:54.967 --> 39:56.367
- Eight.

40:02.333 --> 40:03.400
He's a seven.

40:03.533 --> 40:05.900
Jumped up, pumped up
brainless dick.

40:09.433 --> 40:10.433
Whore!

40:11.800 --> 40:12.800
Whore!

40:13.300 --> 40:14.300
Whore!

40:15.867 --> 40:16.867
Whore!

40:17.633 --> 40:18.633
Whore!

40:31.100 --> 40:32.167
Okay, you bastards.

40:33.267 --> 40:34.233
Here I come.

40:49.133 --> 40:50.233
Where are you Holly?

40:56.867 --> 40:58.467
There you are.

40:58.600 --> 41:00.067
Time to meet
your handsome date.

41:32.733 --> 41:34.300
Special delivery.

41:41.967 --> 41:44.067
Oh, no, no, no.
That's not my guy,

41:44.133 --> 41:45.200
that's just an ugly piece
of shit

41:45.333 --> 41:47.267
I'd never let
inside my panties.

41:47.400 --> 41:49.500
Don't worry bitch,
you're such a dog.

41:49.633 --> 41:50.767
I wouldn't even rape you.

41:52.667 --> 41:53.700
-Hey.
-Hey.

42:00.500 --> 42:03.267
Two four four two.
Give us a few minutes, man,
this order's only just come in.

42:03.400 --> 42:04.600
No problem. I'll lock my bike.

42:06.133 --> 42:07.300
Hey.

42:07.433 --> 42:08.833
Don't leave your box here.
Stick it over there.

42:25.433 --> 42:27.600
Have fun on your date,
Holly.

42:35.467 --> 42:37.667
Guys you've got
about two minutes left
of being pretty.

42:38.667 --> 42:39.667
Enjoy!

42:44.167 --> 42:45.167
Bye bye.

43:03.900 --> 43:04.867
Woah.
