02:50.958 --> 02:53.208
- <i>Ñandú </i> means...
- Spider.

02:54.333 --> 02:57.750
And <i>káva</i> means... wasp.

03:56.583 --> 03:58.208
Voyeur!

04:02.083 --> 04:03.708
Voyeur!

04:15.083 --> 04:16.291
Malemba,

04:16.541 --> 04:18.333
who's the voyeur?

04:21.083 --> 04:22.458
Voyeur!

05:14.542 --> 05:17.250
We need the boy to confess.

05:17.375 --> 05:20.875
And for you to find a way
to dismiss all the charges.

05:22.750 --> 05:24.750
He's not talking.

05:31.542 --> 05:35.292
To free oneself of one's position,
one must first take care of it.

05:35.417 --> 05:37.875
I say this for you
and everyone else here.

05:39.875 --> 05:41.458
He won't talk.

05:42.292 --> 05:44.542
- May I?
- Please.

05:49.625 --> 05:51.208
Good morning.

05:51.333 --> 05:54.042
Ventura Prieto,
Assistant to the Magistrate.

06:02.333 --> 06:03.667
You can go.

06:04.583 --> 06:06.417
There will be no punishment.

06:15.083 --> 06:16.917
No punishment.

06:17.708 --> 06:18.917
You can go.

06:20.875 --> 06:23.125
Not without a statement.

06:34.625 --> 06:36.583
Guard,

06:36.708 --> 06:39.167
show this good man the way out.

07:06.125 --> 07:08.042
There's a fish...

07:17.625 --> 07:19.000
There's... a fish...

07:19.125 --> 07:21.208
You're still under oath.

07:23.375 --> 07:25.667
There's a fish

07:25.792 --> 07:28.000
that spends its life

07:28.125 --> 07:29.667
swimming to and fro.

07:31.333 --> 07:34.625
Fighting water
that seeks to cast it upon dry land.

07:37.167 --> 07:39.125
Because the water rejects it.

07:41.250 --> 07:43.333
The water doesn't want it.

07:52.292 --> 07:54.833
<i>These long-suffering fish,</i>

07:55.917 --> 07:59.000
<i>so attached to the element
that repels them,</i>

07:59.792 --> 08:02.625
<i>devote all their energy</i>

08:02.750 --> 08:05.250
<i>to remaining in place.</i>

08:08.708 --> 08:12.125
<i>You'll never find them
in the central part of the river,</i>

08:13.417 --> 08:14.750
<i>but always near the banks.</i>

08:30.167 --> 08:31.458
Fernandez.

08:35.042 --> 08:37.167
'My lady, my Marta,

08:38.542 --> 08:40.417
I write to you with concern.

08:40.542 --> 08:43.750
For 14 months, I've waited
for news of you

08:44.750 --> 08:46.292
and my children.'

08:49.833 --> 08:51.958
The Governor told me

08:53.125 --> 08:56.000
it won't be long before my departure.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.250
The Governor assured me

09:02.375 --> 09:05.375
that it won't be long
before my departure.

09:07.958 --> 09:09.375
What do you want?

09:11.625 --> 09:14.167
- Message for Diego de Zama.
- That's me.

09:15.167 --> 09:17.917
They're expecting you
at Getaway Beach.

09:19.958 --> 09:22.167
- Who's expecting me?
- A man.

09:51.792 --> 09:54.500
I need you to speak to the Minister,
Diego.

09:55.375 --> 09:58.333
I don't want those leeches
boarding my ship.

09:59.833 --> 10:02.833
Your relationship
with the Treasury Minister is good?

10:02.958 --> 10:06.125
Everyone here is willing to do business,
Indalecio.

10:06.250 --> 10:08.333
No payments for over a year.

10:09.208 --> 10:12.083
We've got to unload
the Oriental's brandy.

10:13.250 --> 10:15.208
He's made a fortune
in Montevideo.

10:16.083 --> 10:19.042
Now he wants to expand his business
upriver.

10:20.917 --> 10:23.958
Did Marta give you a letter for me?

10:26.208 --> 10:28.875
Marta is making many
sacrifices, Diego.

10:29.958 --> 10:31.833
Taking care of your children.

10:33.042 --> 10:34.542
They're growing.

10:41.417 --> 10:43.500
Did you see her... often?

10:46.542 --> 10:48.375
My friend, the Oriental!

10:50.083 --> 10:52.958
A man who has seen the future
from Montevideo!

10:58.542 --> 11:02.500
I'm grateful that you're willing
to help us, Don Diego.

11:09.333 --> 11:11.792
If you excuse me,
I'll now retire to rest.

11:17.333 --> 11:19.792
Do we need an armed escort?

11:21.833 --> 11:25.125
- They warned us about a 'Vicuña'.
- Vicuña is dead!

11:25.250 --> 11:27.125
He was killed 1000 times.

11:27.250 --> 11:30.125
Don't worry. You're in good hands now.

11:30.250 --> 11:31.583
Go and rest.

11:34.375 --> 11:36.125
The Oriental's son.

11:38.083 --> 11:41.292
During the voyage,
I told him who Don Diego de Zama was.

11:43.167 --> 11:45.792
The magistrate, Don Diego de Zama.

11:51.708 --> 11:54.292
A god who was born old

11:54.417 --> 11:56.000
and can't die.

11:56.125 --> 11:58.292
His loneliness is atrocious.

12:02.833 --> 12:04.333
Are you talking to me?

12:18.208 --> 12:20.708
The magistrate,
 Don Diego de Zama,

12:22.250 --> 12:23.792
vigorous,

12:23.917 --> 12:25.500
in charge.

12:27.708 --> 12:32.542
The pacifier of Indians. He who did
justice without drawing his sword.

12:40.292 --> 12:44.167
It's not Zama who hides behind
obligations without surprises or risks.

12:46.208 --> 12:47.673
Zama the corregidor.

12:48.002 --> 12:51.078
A corregidor with the
spirit of justice.

12:59.583 --> 13:01.500
A man of law.

13:01.625 --> 13:02.917
A judge.

13:03.042 --> 13:04.875
A man without fear.

13:17.167 --> 13:19.167
Good evening.

13:26.125 --> 13:27.750
Your shirt?

13:39.500 --> 13:41.625
There's no one there, Don Diego.

13:53.042 --> 13:54.250
Rita.

13:56.917 --> 13:58.417
Are you hurt?

14:42.167 --> 14:44.333
There's nothing to fear.

14:51.625 --> 14:53.417
Who goes there?

15:12.792 --> 15:14.167
What's happening?

15:17.250 --> 15:19.333
Did they rob you, Don Diego?

15:20.917 --> 15:24.333
- Was there a robbery?
- No, I arrived just in time.

15:30.042 --> 15:31.667
It's the dead boy.

15:33.667 --> 15:35.375
Was it a fair-skinned boy?

15:35.500 --> 15:38.417
No. Perhaps. I was here.

15:43.958 --> 15:45.417
Diego...

15:47.125 --> 15:48.917
I fear for my daughters.

15:50.708 --> 15:52.833
They're my treasure,

15:52.958 --> 15:54.833
magnificent women.

15:56.417 --> 16:00.667
Since my wife died,
I brush their hair every night.

16:02.042 --> 16:03.625
I fear for them.

16:04.833 --> 16:06.458
Sometimes, I get up.

16:06.583 --> 16:08.708
I go to their rooms,

16:08.833 --> 16:12.250
I fix the mosquito nets,
I close the windows...

16:12.375 --> 16:14.958
Vicuña and his men break into houses

16:16.292 --> 16:18.708
and pass their days raping women.

16:21.458 --> 16:22.458
Diego,

16:23.292 --> 16:25.458
I fear for my daughters.

16:27.333 --> 16:30.333
Vicuña and his men break into houses

16:31.333 --> 16:33.917
and spend days raping women.

16:35.708 --> 16:37.792
Vicuña has been executed.

16:37.917 --> 16:39.792
There's nothing to fear.

17:12.875 --> 17:14.791
Don Diego de Zama!

17:20.541 --> 17:22.250
Sit here.

17:34.875 --> 17:36.875
Don Ventura Prieto!

17:43.208 --> 17:44.750
Ladies...

17:58.167 --> 18:01.375
Doña Luciana Piñares de Luenga!

18:05.375 --> 18:08.458
Help me with this, it's poorly fitted.

18:08.583 --> 18:10.167
It's tight here.

18:23.167 --> 18:25.375
Good afternoon.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.458
The mulattas are here.

18:57.917 --> 19:00.083
Won't you help yourself, Don Diego?

19:01.458 --> 19:02.458
No.

19:03.417 --> 19:05.167
You prefer white girls.

19:09.250 --> 19:10.958
Yes.

19:11.083 --> 19:14.667
Your exclusive preferences
surprise me.

19:20.167 --> 19:22.083
Were you robbed at the inn?

19:22.833 --> 19:24.417
Did they rob you?

19:24.542 --> 19:27.250
- Did they?
- No, I intervened.

19:27.375 --> 19:28.917
- Who was it?
- I don't know.

19:29.042 --> 19:32.042
It seems there was a scuffle
in your room last night?

19:32.917 --> 19:34.875
Did they hurt you?

19:36.000 --> 19:40.667
Your landlord's daughter was at the market, 
very nervous about Vicuña Porto.

19:40.833 --> 19:43.750
Apparently Don Diego
confronted Vicuna.

19:50.625 --> 19:54.542
Your friend, the Oriental...
He might have cholera.

19:54.667 --> 19:56.417
There have been other cases.

19:56.542 --> 19:59.917
- Should I send for Doctor Palos?
- No, I'm already aware.

20:20.958 --> 20:25.333
To honour the visit of
Señora Luciana Piñares de Luenga,

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
our beloved Luciana,

20:28.417 --> 20:31.042
she'll hand out the ribbons
to the winner.

20:32.167 --> 20:36.958
Let's head to the gallery. You can sit
wherever you feel most at ease.

20:37.083 --> 20:42.833
In my case, I prefer the company of a
man who bears the white man's burden

20:42.958 --> 20:45.958
and is sanctified by purity.

20:47.708 --> 20:50.500
Luciana is the Treasury Minister's wife,
right?

20:50.625 --> 20:51.917
Yes.

20:53.125 --> 20:56.083
A joke has been making the rounds.

20:57.667 --> 21:01.917
They say Luciana has the most beautiful
body that Zama has ever imagined.

21:02.750 --> 21:04.417
Who said that?

21:05.167 --> 21:06.667
Over there.

21:07.958 --> 21:09.667
The bald man.

21:12.542 --> 21:15.250
Perhaps I should leave.

21:15.375 --> 21:17.042
I haven't got the strength.

21:30.500 --> 21:32.042
Doctor Palos?

21:54.583 --> 21:56.958
- Doctor Palos?
- It's the dead boy.

21:57.083 --> 21:59.458
The little saint is there.

22:52.917 --> 22:54.167
Palos?

23:21.792 --> 23:23.208
Who are you?

23:34.458 --> 23:37.292
I wish to speak
with the Minister of the Treasury,

23:37.417 --> 23:39.833
Señor Honorio Piñares de Luenga.

23:46.792 --> 23:49.417
My business can be postponed.

23:50.417 --> 23:53.667
I need to see a doctor
who is fit to practise medicine.

24:01.958 --> 24:04.417
May I speak with someone in the house?

24:11.333 --> 24:14.667
And Señora Piñares de Luenga...
Is she in?

24:17.583 --> 24:20.167
Distilled in a double alembic.

24:20.875 --> 24:24.208
So, it's distilled many times
before it's ready.

24:25.583 --> 24:27.167
You'll appreciate it.

24:28.833 --> 24:31.792
These recipes are jealously guarded.

24:34.542 --> 24:36.833
- Have you been to Buenos Aires?
- Yes.

24:36.958 --> 24:41.208
I read that many comedy troupes
put on plays with their orchestras.

24:41.333 --> 24:43.833
We have almost no occasion
for elegance here.

24:44.333 --> 24:46.542
That's not something you lack.

24:47.375 --> 24:49.125
My wife wanted to go.

24:57.625 --> 24:59.458
My wife wanted to go.

25:02.250 --> 25:04.333
Me, I'm always on the river...

25:09.875 --> 25:11.833
that comes and goes...

25:15.000 --> 25:18.458
Always far away,
for one reason or another.

25:22.875 --> 25:25.000
It's aged in casks.

25:27.833 --> 25:29.375
Such nobility!

25:31.958 --> 25:33.583
See those?

25:33.708 --> 25:35.625
Bring me the little glasses.

25:35.750 --> 25:37.542
No, the smaller ones.

25:37.667 --> 25:39.208
How beautiful.

25:41.333 --> 25:43.958
There were twelve of them.
Only eight arrived.

25:44.083 --> 25:47.708
They came in a box, well protected,
but not all of them were wrapped.

25:47.833 --> 25:49.833
Such laziness, this packaging.

25:51.042 --> 25:54.125
They were wrapped in newspapers
from Buenos Aires.

25:54.250 --> 25:57.042
And curiously enough,
with that flotilla

25:57.167 --> 26:00.250
came newspapers that
dated back further

26:00.375 --> 26:03.125
than the newspapers
wrapped round my glasses.

26:05.000 --> 26:09.958
My glasses carried more recent news
than the papers distributed here.

26:10.083 --> 26:12.167
Isn't that charming?

26:12.292 --> 26:13.833
And sad?

26:15.708 --> 26:17.583
It doesn't weigh on you, Don Diego,

26:17.708 --> 26:20.875
because you'll be transferred
any day now, I hear.

26:23.208 --> 26:24.708
It doesn't weigh on you,

26:24.833 --> 26:27.667
because you'll be transferred
any day now, I hear.

26:29.250 --> 26:31.958
Where are you hoping to be sent?

26:34.042 --> 26:35.958
To the city of Lerma.

26:36.917 --> 26:38.625
But not just yet.

26:40.750 --> 26:43.417
We have almost no occasion
for elegance here.

26:44.917 --> 26:48.583
The newspapers spoke of the uproar
caused by...

26:48.708 --> 26:50.417
I forget the play.

26:50.542 --> 26:52.167
The applause...

26:52.875 --> 26:55.333
How rare, the occasions for applause.

27:13.250 --> 27:15.917
To the actors who dare
to disguise themselves!

27:53.333 --> 27:55.833
Our friend is not well.

28:03.125 --> 28:06.958
- Should I send for Doctor Palos?
- No, I'm already aware.

28:07.708 --> 28:09.125
Diego...

28:09.875 --> 28:14.042
How timely it is for me to intercede
in favour of your friend's affairs.

28:15.625 --> 28:17.000
Luciana.

28:18.542 --> 28:19.958
Come in!

28:22.292 --> 28:23.833
Has he left?

28:23.958 --> 28:25.542
He felt indisposed.

28:25.667 --> 28:28.125
His poor manners are forgiven.

28:29.458 --> 28:32.625
- You should send for Doctor Palos.
- Of course.

28:32.750 --> 28:35.875
Once your friend recovers,
come and see me again, Diego.

28:37.500 --> 28:39.750
I'll do everything in my power.

28:40.125 --> 28:42.208
I'll send a letter to my husband,

28:42.333 --> 28:44.583
informing him of our affairs.

28:48.708 --> 28:51.792
When he's away,
he torments me with tender missives.

28:51.917 --> 28:54.208
This servant here, this black man,

28:54.333 --> 28:57.333
comes and goes with messages.
With this heat...

29:01.792 --> 29:03.167
Señora,

29:04.042 --> 29:06.250
it grieves me to learn this.

29:10.875 --> 29:14.083
Many women despise my independence.

29:14.208 --> 29:17.292
And too many men misunderstand
my conduct.

29:17.417 --> 29:19.208
Small-minded people.

29:21.083 --> 29:22.542
Yet abundant.

29:30.125 --> 29:33.375
People are less alone

29:33.500 --> 29:37.667
in the big cities, whilst knowing
each other less, don't you think?

29:41.667 --> 29:44.708
Is this summer worse,
or am I just more impatient?

29:44.833 --> 29:46.708
Houses suffocate me.

29:48.083 --> 29:49.625
I prefer the river.

29:57.208 --> 29:59.750
If only we had some cold months.

29:59.875 --> 30:03.208
Yes, time doesn't pass
when there's no winter.

30:05.292 --> 30:06.917
The snow...

30:08.292 --> 30:09.958
So elegant.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.125
The Russian princesses
wrapped in furs.

30:17.083 --> 30:18.417
The perfumes.

30:19.333 --> 30:22.000
The heated houses, with rugs.

30:23.875 --> 30:26.875
Europe is best remembered
by those who were never there.

30:27.792 --> 30:29.833
I recall nothing about it.

30:29.958 --> 30:32.458
Marriage forces you to forget.

30:32.583 --> 30:34.208
Or so I've been told.

30:51.917 --> 30:54.083
Diego, let's not be reckless.

31:22.875 --> 31:26.750
- The Governor has sent me to assist you.
- What's this circus?

31:26.875 --> 31:29.292
These people have friends
in high places.

31:30.417 --> 31:33.542
- The Governor wants to keep his position.
- My position?

31:34.000 --> 31:36.125
Yes. Yours, too.

31:45.792 --> 31:49.667
The Administration's Magistrate,
Diego de Zama.

31:50.208 --> 31:53.417
Ventura Prieto, Assistant Magistrate.

31:58.167 --> 32:01.542
We are old settlers of Concepción.

32:02.833 --> 32:05.375
Descendants of the first-comers.

32:06.208 --> 32:09.250
Our father is a direct,
blood descendant

32:09.375 --> 32:12.208
of Don Domingo Martinez de Irala.

32:13.167 --> 32:16.708
We chased the Indians
from these lands.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.667
But they came back with claims.

32:23.875 --> 32:26.458
We chased them out again,

32:27.333 --> 32:28.917
and so on.

32:30.042 --> 32:32.250
They fled into the jungle.

32:33.583 --> 32:35.625
We went looking for them,

32:37.167 --> 32:39.625
and showed no mercy.

32:41.250 --> 32:45.417
None were spared.
And now there's no one left to work.

32:46.875 --> 32:48.667
I only have my granddaughter.

32:50.667 --> 32:52.667
She has mixed blood.

32:54.833 --> 32:56.750
She was held captive.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.250
We managed to get her back.

33:05.250 --> 33:08.667
It's our right to claim an <i>encomienda.</i>

33:09.750 --> 33:12.083
Forty tame Indians.

33:17.958 --> 33:19.958
A concession of Indians?

33:25.958 --> 33:27.917
You shall have enough Indians.

33:29.292 --> 33:31.000
You may return in peace.

33:31.500 --> 33:35.750
You have the Governor's word:
His Majesty will receive your request.

34:07.667 --> 34:10.792
They haven't got title deeds
or documents. We have nothing.

34:10.917 --> 34:15.583
Find a way to retrieve them.
This noble family has suffered enough.

34:15.708 --> 34:18.750
The name of Irala isn't enough
to enslave natives.

34:21.583 --> 34:23.333
What did you say, Ventura?

34:24.125 --> 34:28.417
Taking away freedom requires more
than a paper with Irala's name on it.

34:28.542 --> 34:31.292
You disapprove of my benevolence?

34:31.417 --> 34:35.042
What title do you deem valid
to obtain an encomienda of Indians?

34:36.292 --> 34:37.875
None.

34:39.750 --> 34:43.292
Am I talking to a functionary
of the Crown?

34:43.417 --> 34:44.875
You're talking to a man

34:45.000 --> 34:48.125
astonished by how many Americans
want to pass for Spaniards,

34:48.250 --> 34:50.458
instead of being what they are.

34:53.917 --> 34:55.458
'A man, astonished by...'

35:06.167 --> 35:07.417
Such bravura!

35:07.542 --> 35:10.833
They say you almost captured
Vicuña Porto!

36:01.000 --> 36:02.333
Diego,

36:03.250 --> 36:05.000
what have they done to you?

36:05.792 --> 36:07.292
When will you return?

36:08.042 --> 36:09.875
Your children are growing.

36:10.417 --> 36:12.125
They're growing tired.

36:14.042 --> 36:15.583
And so am I.

36:18.500 --> 36:20.875
I'll be there soon, Marta.

36:22.417 --> 36:24.542
A ship is coming.

36:26.542 --> 36:28.333
With Royal Mail.

36:29.750 --> 36:31.583
For overdue payments.

36:34.792 --> 36:36.958
We must be patient, Marta.

36:57.125 --> 36:58.792
Are you hurt?

37:00.125 --> 37:01.625
He humiliated me.

37:03.250 --> 37:04.750
He bit me.

37:09.333 --> 37:10.792
So many times.

37:13.542 --> 37:15.667
Have you avenged me, Diego?

37:20.458 --> 37:24.208
He forced me to submit to his desires.
He mocked me.

37:27.458 --> 37:29.167
You avenged me.

37:31.417 --> 37:33.417
Who did this, Rita?

37:33.542 --> 37:35.417
Officer Bermudez.

37:37.250 --> 37:38.708
The bald one?

37:39.583 --> 37:42.583
He thought no one would
come to my defence.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.917
You, Zama, who have nothing.

37:48.750 --> 37:52.333
I won't let my father fight a duel.

37:54.042 --> 37:56.208
You've got nothing to lose.

37:57.292 --> 37:58.917
You avenged me.

37:59.042 --> 38:00.375
And now...

38:01.625 --> 38:03.542
that scoundrel is dead.

38:05.292 --> 38:06.500
No.

38:08.292 --> 38:10.042
I didn't kill him.

38:11.667 --> 38:13.083
Who said that?

38:13.208 --> 38:15.250
Then you must avenge me.

38:16.542 --> 38:19.875
You're capable of killing,
you have nothing to lose.

38:20.500 --> 38:22.042
Yes, I do.

38:22.875 --> 38:24.583
A Wife.

38:25.667 --> 38:27.417
I've got children, Rita.

38:28.917 --> 38:32.875
I'm the Crown's Magistrate.
A functionary.

38:35.583 --> 38:37.333
A monk has come.

38:38.292 --> 38:41.708
He said you should pay
for the funeral expenses.

38:46.667 --> 38:48.625
Who has died, Rita?

39:12.167 --> 39:14.417
Part of the payment must
be made in advance.

39:14.542 --> 39:18.125
The rest can be paid when the mourning
period allows, of course.

39:19.375 --> 39:23.083
I was told the cargo of the deceased
is being held up at customs.

39:23.208 --> 39:25.083
Have they seized it?

39:29.250 --> 39:32.958
They released two casks
to cover burial expenses.

39:33.083 --> 39:36.500
Brandy that we're selling
at a very reasonable price.

39:36.625 --> 39:39.083
People grow tired of schnapps...

39:40.875 --> 39:43.917
The other casks were confiscated.

39:45.167 --> 39:47.792
The customs officer informed me.

39:52.708 --> 39:55.375
Death imposes conditions on all of us.

39:55.500 --> 39:59.333
I'll offend his stature
if I conduct a pauper's rites.

39:59.458 --> 40:00.792
Where?

40:00.917 --> 40:02.750
Next to the boy.

40:06.500 --> 40:09.583
The preparation of the bodies
must be paid for

40:09.708 --> 40:12.042
before their transfer to Montevideo.

40:14.708 --> 40:17.917
Until then, we'll have to keep them
in our crypt.

40:18.042 --> 40:19.792
It's cooler here.

40:24.333 --> 40:26.917
We could also burn them.

40:27.042 --> 40:29.042
They died of the plague.

40:30.958 --> 40:33.292
Don't incur further expenses,
Excellency.

40:33.417 --> 40:38.500
That needs to be discussed
with the Father in charge of accounts.

40:44.750 --> 40:47.250
I would like to shave.

41:11.083 --> 41:14.625
I didn't want you to hear about
the unfortunate event from anyone else.

41:14.750 --> 41:17.000
Our friend, the Oriental, is dead.

41:24.042 --> 41:25.917
I don't need the fan.

41:38.583 --> 41:40.500
Your friend wasn't well.

41:42.292 --> 41:43.958
A dead boy?

41:47.917 --> 41:50.875
The plague in the ships is relentless.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.542
How unfortunate.

41:53.167 --> 41:55.125
Malemba wants to get married.

41:55.250 --> 41:57.625
Who is Malemba?

41:57.750 --> 42:00.296
The funeral will keep us
very busy these days.

42:00.337 --> 42:02.300
We must prepare for mourning.

42:02.917 --> 42:04.750
Let's drink in his honour.

42:04.875 --> 42:06.792
There won't be a wake.

42:07.667 --> 42:10.083
The Oriental was an austere man.

42:11.083 --> 42:14.500
The Bishop believes
we should adhere to his ways.

42:17.375 --> 42:19.042
Such austerity.

42:19.167 --> 42:20.875
What a pity.

42:21.000 --> 42:24.708
There will be no wake.
Only something modest and boring.

42:25.292 --> 42:27.750
How sad. What a shame.

42:29.208 --> 42:32.083
Who wants to get married?

42:32.208 --> 42:34.042
Malemba.

42:34.167 --> 42:37.208
She bought her freedom
and already wants to lose it.

42:37.333 --> 42:40.167
I told my husband:
she can't give her consent.

42:40.292 --> 42:42.417
Can a mute give her consent?

42:48.458 --> 42:50.708
The black man came today with letters.

42:51.500 --> 42:54.417
All men covet my body.

42:54.542 --> 42:58.250
Honorio, my own husband,
is fascinated by flesh.

42:59.500 --> 43:01.250
I despise him.

43:02.000 --> 43:05.333
And all men,
for their desire to possess.

43:08.417 --> 43:13.083
I'm grateful to have met
a woman of your character.

43:14.375 --> 43:16.500
Malemba has suffered enough.

43:17.250 --> 43:20.958
She swam across the river,
fleeing an abusive tobacco farmer.

43:21.083 --> 43:23.708
She swam not only for hours,
but how long was it?

43:25.000 --> 43:26.292
How long?

43:26.417 --> 43:31.250
Days in the water, clinging to life.
She was captured again in Chaco.

43:31.375 --> 43:33.167
They flayed her feet

43:33.292 --> 43:36.000
and rubbed that horrible plant on her.

43:41.500 --> 43:43.250
On the soles of her feet.

43:49.083 --> 43:52.958
I thought her muteness and limping
were linked.

43:53.500 --> 43:55.125
She's not mute.

43:55.250 --> 43:56.917
She has her tongue.

44:05.292 --> 44:08.250
I want to settle this marriage affair.

44:08.375 --> 44:09.792
Malemba's.

44:14.083 --> 44:16.083
Nothing prevents it.

44:16.208 --> 44:19.375
Valid consent is given
in written form.

44:19.500 --> 44:22.208
Your husband's signature will validate
the union.

44:22.333 --> 44:24.833
Your mute can get married.

44:24.958 --> 44:26.500
You deserve a kiss.

44:31.125 --> 44:32.625
Not now.

44:59.708 --> 45:02.000
A message for Diego de Zama.

45:04.500 --> 45:06.208
That's me. Speak.

45:06.333 --> 45:09.208
The Governor says you must go.

45:09.333 --> 45:10.500
I must go?

45:10.625 --> 45:12.667
To his office.

45:15.333 --> 45:17.292
Mail has arrived.

45:38.750 --> 45:40.292
It's over!

45:55.792 --> 45:57.333
Governor?

46:07.250 --> 46:10.750
'Having requested observance
of this sovereign provision

46:10.875 --> 46:13.417
and given the Royal Accord
on this case,

46:13.500 --> 46:16.667
I have resolved, by this decree
of last November 27th,

46:16.792 --> 46:19.833
declaring as I declare,
that blah, blah, blah...'

46:20.708 --> 46:22.792
I'm being transferred to Spain.

46:25.417 --> 46:27.042
Royal Mail?

46:28.000 --> 46:30.917
When did it arrive? Any news for me?

46:31.042 --> 46:32.958
No, not yet.

46:35.958 --> 46:40.500
I've been forced, due to your superior
rank, to deport Ventura Prieto.

46:45.792 --> 46:48.000
Deported for a brawl?

46:48.125 --> 46:49.750
It was just a brawl.

46:51.250 --> 46:55.625
A brawl in the street doesn't look good
for a functionary of your status.

46:57.500 --> 47:00.083
I didn't want to be
excessively severe.

47:00.875 --> 47:04.500
I've written a letter of recommendation
for Ventura Prieto.

47:04.667 --> 47:07.958
What's important is that
his reputation not be tainted.

47:08.083 --> 47:10.792
Ventura is a Spanish functionary.

47:13.458 --> 47:16.792
You can't afford such risks, Diego.

47:18.458 --> 47:20.500
You've chosen the city of Lerma.

47:20.667 --> 47:21.875
Yes.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.875
I've requested a transfer
to the city of Lerma.

47:26.042 --> 47:28.958
Ventura Prieto has chosen
the city of Lerma.

47:35.875 --> 47:37.917
The deported...

47:38.042 --> 47:40.083
gets to choose his destination

47:40.500 --> 47:42.458
and gets a recommendation?

47:44.167 --> 47:46.792
Make a copy of the Crown's resolution.

47:47.833 --> 47:50.083
And announce my departure at once.

48:49.833 --> 48:51.000
Malemba,

48:51.333 --> 48:53.625
tell your Señora I need to see her.

49:08.500 --> 49:11.500
Malemba, is someone at the door?

49:21.333 --> 49:23.208
Will you not announce me?

49:50.625 --> 49:52.417
Honorio had been asleep for a while,

49:52.500 --> 49:57.750
when suddenly I woke up startled
and saw it crawling up Honorio's neck.

49:58.292 --> 50:01.083
I couldn't move, cry or shout.

50:03.375 --> 50:05.333
What's here?

50:05.458 --> 50:07.208
It itches.

50:11.167 --> 50:13.042
At dawn, I saw it on the ground,

50:13.167 --> 50:15.292
still moving, with grubs on its back.

50:15.417 --> 50:17.625
It was the spider wasp.

50:17.750 --> 50:20.250
It lays eggs inside living spiders.

50:30.417 --> 50:32.375
Help me with this.

50:38.750 --> 50:40.833
Malemba, is someone at the door?

51:07.750 --> 51:09.792
Damask curtains...

51:10.833 --> 51:12.333
Missing.

51:13.417 --> 51:15.917
A table with ebony nails.

51:16.792 --> 51:18.958
There was a painting on that wall.

51:20.458 --> 51:23.292
A portrait of Our Majesty, the King.

51:29.750 --> 51:32.958
The Governor was very fond
of that painting, as well.

51:34.875 --> 51:37.125
The chairs with velvet upholstery?

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
They were to his liking, as well.

51:42.875 --> 51:45.625
He took the harnesses and 14 saddles.

51:46.875 --> 51:48.750
Should I record this?

52:29.708 --> 52:31.333
That's not him.

52:33.708 --> 52:35.042
It's that one.

52:48.000 --> 52:49.458
Can't he walk?

52:50.500 --> 52:52.625
Does he talk?

52:52.750 --> 52:54.583
A few words.

53:15.417 --> 53:18.917
'The sailor's wife gets rich,
when plenty are the fish!'

53:27.250 --> 53:29.625
Come, Zama. Pull up a chair.

53:31.000 --> 53:32.708
Today is a lucky day.

53:33.625 --> 53:35.708
Show him the ears.

53:41.750 --> 53:43.500
Tell him the story.

53:44.083 --> 53:47.167
The ears of Vicuña Porto,

53:47.292 --> 53:49.625
cutoff before his execution.

53:51.083 --> 53:53.042
The cruelty of men...

53:54.417 --> 53:56.250
This is what's at stake.

53:57.125 --> 53:58.417
Slowly.

54:04.208 --> 54:06.708
Governor, I've brought you a scribe.

54:06.833 --> 54:09.750
If this game will last long,
I can excuse him.

54:14.000 --> 54:15.292
A scribe?

54:16.125 --> 54:18.333
For the letter you offered to write.

54:21.375 --> 54:23.000
What letter?

54:23.958 --> 54:25.426
My request to the King

54:25.772 --> 54:28.068
on the occasion of my
becoming a father.

54:28.333 --> 54:29.917
You're a father?

54:30.042 --> 54:32.667
Bring the child. They bring luck.

54:38.375 --> 54:40.500
The ears change hands!

54:49.458 --> 54:51.000
What's in the bag?

54:51.125 --> 54:52.583
Allow me.

54:58.958 --> 55:00.500
Well, well!

55:08.667 --> 55:09.958
Magistrate.

55:12.333 --> 55:14.500
This... is worthless.

55:19.667 --> 55:22.333
Coconuts are worthless, right?

55:23.167 --> 55:24.667
Doesn't matter.

55:24.792 --> 55:26.250
I'll keep it anyway.

55:27.125 --> 55:28.458
Officer,

55:29.042 --> 55:31.417
see our friend to the city gates.

55:31.500 --> 55:33.375
Vicuña Porto is dead.

55:34.042 --> 55:35.708
One shouldn't touch them.

55:36.250 --> 55:37.667
Don't touch.

55:37.958 --> 55:39.125
No.

55:41.667 --> 55:43.958
The ears of Vicuña Porto.

55:44.958 --> 55:46.500
Vicuña...

55:48.333 --> 55:49.625
...is dead.

55:51.333 --> 55:52.958
The ears of Vicuña Porto.

55:53.083 --> 55:54.417
Governor,

55:55.000 --> 55:57.333
could you attend to the letter?

55:57.458 --> 55:58.792
Of course.

55:59.667 --> 56:02.625
A letter to the King requesting
your transfer.

56:02.750 --> 56:05.708
We'll plead to His Majesty
for my good friend.

56:32.250 --> 56:34.042
What are you writing?

56:38.000 --> 56:39.833
A book, Governor.

56:40.583 --> 56:43.500
We need to draft a letter
to be sealed and...

56:43.625 --> 56:45.417
A book?

56:46.417 --> 56:48.000
A book?

56:49.042 --> 56:50.667
Make children,

56:51.833 --> 56:53.458
not books.

56:54.208 --> 56:57.417
Learn a lesson from our Magistrate,
Manuel.

57:02.667 --> 57:05.667
I can't know
what my children will be like.

57:05.792 --> 57:08.250
But I do know
what this book will be like.

57:16.458 --> 57:19.792
Your Eminence, I believe
there's nothing to worry about.

57:29.125 --> 57:30.667
Let's go.

57:33.833 --> 57:36.667
- Should I look for another scribe?
- Let's go!

57:48.958 --> 57:51.208
Should I look for another scribe?

57:51.333 --> 57:54.333
Why write a book
inside the Government House,

57:54.458 --> 57:58.083
while others work
for the glory of His Majesty?

57:58.208 --> 57:59.833
I only wish...

58:02.708 --> 58:04.958
Were you aware of this book?

58:05.750 --> 58:08.792
Your Eminence, I believe
there's nothing to worry about.

58:08.917 --> 58:10.958
You didn't know about this book?

58:11.917 --> 58:13.833
I never knew about the book.

58:13.958 --> 58:17.500
How long have you been here, Zama?
You knew nothing about it?

58:20.167 --> 58:22.917
The Administration's
longest-serving functionary

58:23.042 --> 58:24.833
knows nothing about this book?

58:30.500 --> 58:33.167
I want to grill these fish
with their heads.

58:40.667 --> 58:44.417
Get the horses out of here.
This isn't a stable.

58:54.958 --> 58:58.208
- What is it?
- A message for Diego de Zama.

58:59.417 --> 59:02.500
- That's me. What is it?
- Inventory.

59:05.667 --> 59:07.292
What inventory?

59:07.458 --> 59:09.958
They're taking
everything to the patio.

59:14.208 --> 59:17.917
The Governor commands everyone
to clean and tidy up.

59:32.125 --> 59:33.750
Take this.

01:00:14.958 --> 01:00:18.917
I know the Governor has requested
that you report on my book.

01:00:19.042 --> 01:00:20.875
Here it is.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
For your consideration.

01:00:24.167 --> 01:00:25.583
Fernandez,

01:00:26.333 --> 01:00:29.042
I haven't yet decided
on my new residence.

01:00:29.167 --> 01:00:32.417
I need to keep my furniture
in the chapel a bit longer.

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:34.000
Let me help you.

01:00:34.583 --> 01:00:36.208
You're my first reader.

01:00:38.292 --> 01:00:40.083
Which are your things?

01:00:40.625 --> 01:00:42.042
The bed.

01:00:43.083 --> 01:00:44.833
These three chairs.

01:00:47.250 --> 01:00:49.792
Two small chests 
with my name on them.

01:01:10.958 --> 01:01:14.167
They're making an inventory
of the Government's property.

01:01:15.458 --> 01:01:17.750
Your furniture has been listed.

01:01:19.125 --> 01:01:21.000
I could remove some things.

01:01:22.375 --> 01:01:25.042
But it will come at a cost.

01:01:25.167 --> 01:01:27.208
How inadequate!

01:01:27.333 --> 01:01:29.625
When I've settled in a new residence,

01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:31.667
I'll send for my belongings.

01:01:33.667 --> 01:01:37.000
We must do it now,
and with the utmost discretion.

01:01:39.417 --> 01:01:42.500
I was told of an inn
on the outskirts of town.

01:01:43.792 --> 01:01:45.708
Let me help you.

01:01:45.833 --> 01:01:47.583
You're my first reader.

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:51.333
Take care of the move.

01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:31.250
That boy she's holding is my son.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.833
- Is that the mother?
- Yes.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.333
That one.

01:02:40.875 --> 01:02:42.208
Emilia.

01:02:45.375 --> 01:02:46.583
Fernandez,

01:02:47.292 --> 01:02:49.917
take that bed to Señora Emilia.

01:04:04.375 --> 01:04:06.292
What is this dump?

01:04:23.792 --> 01:04:25.167
The porters

01:04:25.958 --> 01:04:27.958
are afraid of this house.

01:04:32.625 --> 01:04:34.083
Leave it there.

01:04:45.417 --> 01:04:47.500
I'll only stay a few days.

01:04:49.375 --> 01:04:52.417
Until I find a proper residence.

01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:01.083
Keep the book until you finish it.

01:05:01.208 --> 01:05:02.917
I haven't made a copy.

01:05:03.042 --> 01:05:05.917
I know nothing about your book.

01:05:06.042 --> 01:05:10.625
I never knew it existed.
And no one has requested a report.

01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:13.708
The Governor feels that working hours
at the Government House

01:05:13.833 --> 01:05:15.625
are to serve the King.

01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:18.083
Your Grace,

01:05:18.375 --> 01:05:19.958
with all due respect,

01:05:21.167 --> 01:05:23.667
I have no master when I write my book.

01:05:41.125 --> 01:05:43.167
I wish it were the inexplicable.

01:05:44.958 --> 01:05:46.583
But a boy is in there.

01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:50.333
Bury this book,

01:05:50.458 --> 01:05:53.167
until all of this blows over,
Fernández.

01:06:07.625 --> 01:06:09.083
Go away!

01:06:23.917 --> 01:06:25.458
Who are you?

01:06:28.417 --> 01:06:29.833
Zumala.

01:06:31.458 --> 01:06:33.875
Bring me a chain and a lock.

01:06:35.583 --> 01:06:38.000
No one enters this house.

01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:43.292
Tell the innkeeper
to bring me a chain and a lock.

01:06:47.167 --> 01:06:48.667
He's sick.

01:06:50.792 --> 01:06:52.875
The innkeeper is sick.

01:07:07.917 --> 01:07:09.500
I need a shirt.

01:07:09.667 --> 01:07:11.292
Am I your wife?

01:07:17.833 --> 01:07:20.083
You're the mother of my son.

01:08:01.458 --> 01:08:03.958
Governor,
should I fetch another scribe

01:08:04.083 --> 01:08:07.875
for the letter to the King
that you suggested?

01:08:10.625 --> 01:08:13.292
No letter without a report.

01:08:14.167 --> 01:08:15.667
What report?

01:08:16.417 --> 01:08:18.125
Must I ask for it?

01:08:18.957 --> 01:08:21.417
A book is being written
behind the Crown's back,

01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:23.500
which is your back, as well.

01:08:23.707 --> 01:08:26.832
Your Eminence,
I don't think you should worry.

01:08:28.707 --> 01:08:30.582
You should worry.

01:08:30.707 --> 01:08:33.500
I expect a damning report, ruthless,

01:08:35.582 --> 01:08:38.292
that puts an end to this chicanery.

01:08:39.375 --> 01:08:43.332
Only then will I be willing
to make your request to the King.

01:08:44.417 --> 01:08:47.457
Leaving out, of course,
that your son is a bastard.

01:08:50.207 --> 01:08:52.417
The Magistrate knows very well

01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:57.582
that this benefit is only reserved
for a functionary's legitimate son.

01:09:03.207 --> 01:09:05.167
Governor,

01:09:06.292 --> 01:09:10.250
my transfer has suffered more delays
than can be tolerated.

01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:13.332
Here's what I think:

01:09:13.792 --> 01:09:15.625
You want to leave?

01:09:16.875 --> 01:09:18.707
Write the report.

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:33.042
He's got his ways.

01:09:34.042 --> 01:09:36.875
They say he executed Vicuña
without mercy.

01:10:42.917 --> 01:10:44.417
Zumala!

01:11:05.583 --> 01:11:06.792
Zumala...

01:11:08.042 --> 01:11:10.500
I rang the bell, and nobody answered.

01:11:11.083 --> 01:11:12.958
I'd like to eat.

01:11:13.333 --> 01:11:15.208
We were sad.

01:11:15.333 --> 01:11:16.417
She has died.

01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:17.917
Who has died?

01:11:18.042 --> 01:11:20.125
Zumala is dead.

01:11:21.292 --> 01:11:23.042
Then who are you?

01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:26.167
Tora.

01:11:27.167 --> 01:11:28.625
Tora,

01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:32.417
you should introduce me
to the other guests...

01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:36.875
- the ladies with the hair...
- You are our only guest, Zama.

01:12:42.917 --> 01:12:44.292
Magistrate...

01:12:48.333 --> 01:12:51.333
The Governor ordered
this rearrangement.

01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:38.292
At your service.

01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:03.000
These are days of scarce work

01:14:05.083 --> 01:14:06.917
for my Ministry.

01:14:08.417 --> 01:14:10.250
So I've been informed.

01:14:12.375 --> 01:14:15.125
Did the Governor mention the report?

01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:16.625
What report?

01:14:16.750 --> 01:14:18.458
You were told about it.

01:14:20.208 --> 01:14:21.500
No.

01:14:22.125 --> 01:14:25.917
The Governor only told me
to relocate here.

01:14:34.375 --> 01:14:36.000
Here!

01:14:40.167 --> 01:14:41.708
That's for me.

01:14:51.042 --> 01:14:53.333
These are Doña Emilia's fish.

01:15:01.792 --> 01:15:03.708
Gifts from Doña Emilia?

01:15:06.833 --> 01:15:08.375
They were bought.

01:15:09.167 --> 01:15:10.667
They're not gifts.

01:15:52.750 --> 01:15:55.000
Overdue payments.

01:15:55.125 --> 01:15:57.875
29 times 1000 makes 29,000.

01:16:00.458 --> 01:16:03.083
Minus 3500 already received, makes...

01:16:05.250 --> 01:16:06.833
25,500.

01:16:10.708 --> 01:16:12.583
This house is rotting.

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:15.125
Rest, Don Diego.

01:16:15.458 --> 01:16:18.708
The sealed letter is
the one that counts, Fernández.

01:16:21.833 --> 01:16:24.500
Crossing the ocean to make a plea...

01:16:53.333 --> 01:16:54.625
Take it easy.

01:17:40.875 --> 01:17:42.292
It's hot.

01:18:08.125 --> 01:18:10.042
At night,

01:18:10.167 --> 01:18:13.292
we could hear a great noise.

01:18:13.417 --> 01:18:14.958
Then they appeared.

01:18:16.417 --> 01:18:17.458
They're...

01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:20.333
round rocks,

01:18:20.458 --> 01:18:22.458
like coconuts,

01:18:22.583 --> 01:18:24.083
but made of stone.

01:18:24.667 --> 01:18:28.250
And their insides are
filled with precious stones.

01:18:30.208 --> 01:18:31.708
So pretty...

01:18:34.833 --> 01:18:36.583
What marvels!

01:18:42.458 --> 01:18:46.125
I wouldn't want
to tarnish Fernández's honour.

01:18:46.625 --> 01:18:49.500
Send him to the city of Lerma,
perhaps,

01:18:49.625 --> 01:18:51.625
with a recommendation.

01:18:52.458 --> 01:18:53.875
He's very young.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.208
A minor sentence should be
sufficient warning.

01:18:58.708 --> 01:19:00.875
Excellent.

01:19:03.208 --> 01:19:04.875
Ruthless.

01:19:07.125 --> 01:19:08.708
Such a...

01:19:09.583 --> 01:19:11.083
sharp pen.

01:19:14.917 --> 01:19:18.167
Could Your Excellency write

01:19:18.292 --> 01:19:20.625
that letter you offered me?

01:19:27.917 --> 01:19:29.500
What letter?

01:19:31.083 --> 01:19:33.417
The letter to the King,

01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:36.208
requesting my transfer.

01:19:36.333 --> 01:19:38.292
Of course. You're a father now.

01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:50.958
The first letter is very important.

01:19:52.792 --> 01:19:54.792
What do you mean, the first letter?

01:19:54.917 --> 01:19:57.250
In a year or two,
we'll send the second one.

01:19:57.375 --> 01:20:01.208
His Majesty doesn't consider
these matters until the second time.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.792
I'll send the first
letter immediately.

01:20:10.333 --> 01:20:13.583
I'll send the first
letter immediately.

01:21:15.583 --> 01:21:17.375
Don Diego de Zama.

01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:22.500
Thank you for coming.

01:21:22.625 --> 01:21:25.667
The list of your titles is impressive.

01:21:27.989 --> 01:21:29.948
You were a corregidor.

01:21:32.417 --> 01:21:36.042
It's surprising to find a volunteer
for a mission like this.

01:21:37.250 --> 01:21:39.000
Captain Parrilla

01:21:40.417 --> 01:21:42.500
is commanding the troops.

01:21:44.167 --> 01:21:46.500
Are you aware of the mission?

01:21:47.792 --> 01:21:50.375
We must get rid of Vicuña Porto.

01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:52.750
They won't beat us, Captain.

01:21:54.292 --> 01:21:56.750
What we seek is to
reactivate commerce.

01:21:57.250 --> 01:21:59.667
We must put an end to theft,

01:21:59.792 --> 01:22:01.125
to arson,

01:22:01.250 --> 01:22:03.458
to gambling houses.

01:22:03.583 --> 01:22:05.792
We must clean up the trade routes.

01:22:06.833 --> 01:22:10.083
That is what my Administration
aims to achieve.

01:22:11.958 --> 01:22:13.792
How long have you been here?

01:22:15.458 --> 01:22:17.167
A long time now.

01:22:20.250 --> 01:22:22.125
Excellent.

01:22:23.458 --> 01:22:25.875
We've got your transfer request here.

01:22:28.042 --> 01:22:33.083
His Majesty will celebrate this return
to arms and especially to victory.

01:22:33.208 --> 01:22:36.417
We must bring back
the head of Vicuña Porto.

01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:39.417
You'll get a hero's welcome.

01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:41.250
With great pomp.

01:23:35.083 --> 01:23:39.292
I woke up last night and felt
something crawling on my neck.

01:23:39.417 --> 01:23:40.958
I went like this

01:23:41.083 --> 01:23:43.875
and felt something strange.

01:23:45.167 --> 01:23:46.500
It's swollen.

01:23:51.833 --> 01:23:54.208
Must be a spider wasp.

01:23:54.333 --> 01:23:56.375
No. A spider.

01:24:38.167 --> 01:24:39.750
Is it an Indian?

01:24:40.875 --> 01:24:43.500
If so, there'll be pieces of silver.

01:24:44.417 --> 01:24:46.042
It's a dead man.

01:24:50.917 --> 01:24:54.083
The Indians, the canoeist
and the other two deserted.

01:24:58.875 --> 01:25:00.208
No silver?

01:25:00.333 --> 01:25:02.333
Nothing, only a dead man.

01:25:03.958 --> 01:25:06.875
Take some men and
capture the deserters!

01:25:24.750 --> 01:25:27.167
Don't move. Be still.

01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:38.458
500 or more of them.

01:25:47.750 --> 01:25:49.583
They're the blind.

01:25:55.167 --> 01:25:57.250
Stay calm and you'll live.

01:26:21.333 --> 01:26:23.333
They were punished.

01:26:26.208 --> 01:26:29.458
And the children were born
after the punishment.

01:26:34.208 --> 01:26:36.667
Punished by Vicuña Porto?

01:26:41.958 --> 01:26:43.833
Perhaps by you lot.

01:28:37.458 --> 01:28:39.417
They took the horses.

01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:43.875
They walk fast for blind people.

01:28:45.333 --> 01:28:48.875
They walk fast, so as not to
disappoint their children.

01:28:53.792 --> 01:28:56.625
Night-time is safer for the blind.

01:29:01.542 --> 01:29:03.833
I'd rather hide during the day.

01:29:06.958 --> 01:29:08.500
That's my sword.

01:29:10.167 --> 01:29:12.333
I should introduce myself.

01:29:20.833 --> 01:29:23.167
My name is Vicuña Porto.

01:29:28.833 --> 01:29:30.125
And you?

01:29:35.167 --> 01:29:37.917
What's the <i>corregidor's</i> name?

01:29:38.042 --> 01:29:39.292
Mercy.

01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:43.750
What did you say, <i>corregidor?</i>

01:29:51.750 --> 01:29:54.375
- Who's there?
- Diego de Zama.

01:29:56.042 --> 01:29:57.917
We're coming.

01:29:58.042 --> 01:30:01.375
They took the horses and the loads.

01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:05.458
There's nothing left.

01:30:05.542 --> 01:30:07.875
Don't say my name, and you'll live.

01:30:29.958 --> 01:30:32.667
Two <i>Guanáes</i> are coming,
don't turn around!

01:30:35.542 --> 01:30:37.250
Don't turn around.

01:30:38.250 --> 01:30:40.000
They're fantasised.

01:30:41.833 --> 01:30:43.042
'Fantasised'?

01:30:43.167 --> 01:30:44.625
Disguised.

01:30:55.875 --> 01:30:57.167
Friends.

01:30:58.917 --> 01:31:00.000
Stay still.

01:31:29.500 --> 01:31:31.750
They've invited us to a celebration.

01:31:31.875 --> 01:31:33.333
A celebration?

01:31:33.667 --> 01:31:37.292
Tell them that the King of Spain,
lord of these vast lands,

01:31:37.458 --> 01:31:40.250
sends his regards
and offers his friendship.

01:31:51.125 --> 01:31:52.667
They want the animal.

01:31:56.875 --> 01:31:58.500
They want the animal.

01:32:19.375 --> 01:32:22.542
Has the <i>corregidor</i> got
any suggestions?

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.333
Let's go.

01:34:43.542 --> 01:34:44.833
Diego de Zama.

01:34:50.167 --> 01:34:52.250
Soldier Gaspar Toledo.

01:34:58.333 --> 01:35:00.417
Soldier Giusepe Nascimento.

01:35:03.875 --> 01:35:05.708
Soldier Umbilino Maria.

01:37:18.917 --> 01:37:21.958
We can't return without Vicuña Porto.

01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:29.792
See that man with the knife?

01:37:31.250 --> 01:37:33.000
That's Vicuña Porto.

01:37:49.208 --> 01:37:50.917
Traitor.

01:37:54.250 --> 01:37:56.417
Careful!

01:37:57.250 --> 01:37:58.833
Right in the middle.

01:38:04.042 --> 01:38:05.542
Food!

01:38:13.542 --> 01:38:15.542
We've got food, Captain!

01:38:15.708 --> 01:38:18.292
- Fish today!
- The famine is over!

01:38:18.625 --> 01:38:20.000
Food!

01:38:26.833 --> 01:38:28.542
Vicuña Porto!

01:38:32.917 --> 01:38:36.292
Tell your men to line up
and lay down their arms.

01:38:43.167 --> 01:38:44.500
It's over.

01:38:53.083 --> 01:38:54.750
Traitor!

01:39:10.167 --> 01:39:11.750
That smell.

01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:25.417
The tigers will smell that arm.

01:39:27.833 --> 01:39:30.958
Dead meat makes them curious.

01:39:32.958 --> 01:39:35.000
But they won't eat it.

01:39:37.792 --> 01:39:40.083
Instead, they'll pounce on us.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.500
Don't tell them I'm sick.

01:40:03.375 --> 01:40:05.000
Traitor.

01:40:12.625 --> 01:40:14.750
Who's singing?

01:40:21.500 --> 01:40:23.167
Who sings?

01:41:23.708 --> 01:41:25.458
I've committed sins.

01:41:27.750 --> 01:41:29.792
But not all of the ones...

01:41:29.917 --> 01:41:32.000
that they blame on Vicuña Porto.

01:41:33.750 --> 01:41:35.500
Understand?

01:41:37.125 --> 01:41:38.708
That's right.

01:41:44.333 --> 01:41:48.000
The Vicuña Porto they talk about
doesn't exist.

01:41:52.500 --> 01:41:54.167
It's not me.

01:41:55.083 --> 01:41:56.750
It's no one.

01:42:07.250 --> 01:42:09.042
It's a name.

01:42:09.750 --> 01:42:11.292
A name.

01:42:12.458 --> 01:42:14.208
Understand?

01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:21.958
My name is Gaspar Toledo.

01:42:24.708 --> 01:42:26.167
What is it?

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.375
What's my name, <i>corregidor?</i>

01:42:38.958 --> 01:42:41.125
I'm not a corregidor.

01:42:42.542 --> 01:42:43.917
That's right.

01:42:44.750 --> 01:42:47.625
You're not the corregidor,

01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:50.375
and I'm not Vicuña Porto.

01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:51.958
But...

01:42:54.375 --> 01:42:56.667
my men want to get rich.

01:42:57.792 --> 01:42:59.375
My men

01:43:00.042 --> 01:43:01.667
want to be rich.

01:43:05.083 --> 01:43:07.667
I promised them it would be so.

01:43:10.375 --> 01:43:12.500
I need the corregidor

01:43:13.417 --> 01:43:15.500
to find the coconuts.

01:43:17.458 --> 01:43:19.292
What coconuts?

01:43:22.708 --> 01:43:24.917
You are the <i>corregidor,</i> right?

01:43:29.292 --> 01:43:31.000
A little water!

01:43:32.208 --> 01:43:34.542
- The captain wants water?
- Water!

01:43:53.458 --> 01:43:56.333
Don't look at me, traitor.
Not even a glance.

01:43:56.917 --> 01:43:58.417
Water.

01:44:02.167 --> 01:44:05.375
I've got a plan.
His Majesty will reward you.

01:44:07.833 --> 01:44:09.333
We'll return with honours...

01:44:55.083 --> 01:44:57.667
They want to get rich.

01:44:57.792 --> 01:44:59.000
Name the place.

01:44:59.125 --> 01:45:01.625
Anywhere North, any place will do.

01:45:01.750 --> 01:45:03.167
What place?

01:45:03.833 --> 01:45:05.333
Where the coconuts are!

01:45:06.250 --> 01:45:07.875
What coconuts?

01:45:08.500 --> 01:45:10.333
You're the corregidor.

01:45:10.458 --> 01:45:11.958
Corregidor,

01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:15.833
the place with the stones,
the round stones.

01:45:16.750 --> 01:45:18.917
The guide doesn't know the place?

01:45:19.542 --> 01:45:21.208
I'm not a guide.

01:45:21.333 --> 01:45:23.500
The <i>corregidor</i> knows the place.

01:45:23.667 --> 01:45:26.625
The coconuts, full of precious stones.

01:45:28.083 --> 01:45:29.792
The <i>corregidor</i> knows...

01:45:33.125 --> 01:45:34.750
Those stones are worthless.

01:45:34.875 --> 01:45:36.958
He's lying!

01:45:39.875 --> 01:45:41.708
They're worthless.

01:45:43.708 --> 01:45:45.292
Traitor.

01:45:49.042 --> 01:45:50.958
They're worthless.

01:45:58.083 --> 01:45:59.833
He's lying!

01:45:59.958 --> 01:46:02.042
Where are the coconuts?

01:46:04.042 --> 01:46:05.542
Those stones are worthless.

01:46:05.708 --> 01:46:07.917
The stones!

01:46:08.042 --> 01:46:09.750
You're lying!

01:46:10.375 --> 01:46:11.875
You're going to die!

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:13.500
Death to Zama!

01:46:14.083 --> 01:46:15.333
Death!

01:46:17.458 --> 01:46:19.000
Leave!

01:46:19.750 --> 01:46:21.042
Leave!

01:46:21.167 --> 01:46:23.667
I'm doing for you
what no one did for me.

01:46:23.792 --> 01:46:25.000
He's lying.

01:46:25.125 --> 01:46:26.208
Leave!

01:46:26.333 --> 01:46:28.125
I'm saying no to your hopes.

01:46:33.917 --> 01:46:36.208
Death to Zama!

01:46:41.875 --> 01:46:43.958
- Traitor.
- Hold him.

01:46:45.250 --> 01:46:47.208
Shove your stumps in the sand.

01:46:47.333 --> 01:46:49.833
If you don't bleed out,
you'll survive.

01:47:46.667 --> 01:47:48.708
Do you want to live?

01:47:58.167 --> 01:48:00.042
Do you want to live?

01:48:01.305 --> 01:48:07.283
