02:21.708 --> 02:24.165
ls there a festival today?

02:24.750 --> 02:28.374
l don't think so.
And yet, every year for 27 years..

02:28.833 --> 02:31.082
..she comes on this day,
to feed the poor.

02:31.708 --> 02:33.874
How could Bharati possibly forget!

02:34.291 --> 02:35.957
Those were momentous times.

02:44.166 --> 02:46.290
Her father Ramnath
Rai was the state's..

02:46.291 --> 02:47.957
..Chief Minister for 14 years..

02:48.208 --> 02:51.582
..but her generation's
heady romance with leftism..

02:51.583 --> 02:54.207
..had turned Bharati into a rebel.

02:54.458 --> 02:57.749
Together with her
charismatic mentor..

02:57.750 --> 03:02.624
..the idealistic Bhaskar Sanyal, she
stormed her father's public rally.

03:03.125 --> 03:07.124
lndian politics was going
through a historic churning..

03:11.875 --> 03:14.665
but Ramnath Rai was
blissfully complacent.

03:14.833 --> 03:16.832
Only his astute
political advisor and..

03:16.833 --> 03:20.999
Bharati's foster-brother, Brij
Gopal had sensed the turning winds.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.665
Comrade Bhaskar will try to
draw you into an argument.

03:24.666 --> 03:26.290
Do not fall into his trap.

03:26.791 --> 03:29.207
l've been a politician
for 20 years, Brij Gopal.

03:29.625 --> 03:31.040
l'm not a fool.

03:34.791 --> 03:38.332
Mr. Rai, we have no
intention of disturbing your rally.

03:38.333 --> 03:42.665
But, if you permit me,
l'd like to ask you..

03:42.666 --> 03:44.915
a few questions on
behalf of the people.

03:45.791 --> 03:47.957
Hey! Hey! Stop him!

03:49.458 --> 03:51.165
Let him come.

03:51.166 --> 03:54.207
The public on whose behalf,
he wants to raise questions..

03:54.791 --> 03:57.749
already knows the answers to them.

03:58.291 --> 04:02.749
And those who have been
enticed by his red flag..

04:02.750 --> 04:07.582
should also be aware of
Ramnath Rai's political sacrifices.

04:07.583 --> 04:09.915
The issue isn't about the
colour of the flag, Mr. Rai.

04:10.916 --> 04:13.999
Poverty, hunger and
unemployment do not discriminate..

04:14.000 --> 04:16.499
..on the basis of colour.

04:16.708 --> 04:19.582
These people are besieged by
their own empty stomachs, Mr. Rai.

04:20.041 --> 04:21.999
Offer them two slices of bread..

04:22.333 --> 04:23.874
make a couple of sweet promises..

04:23.875 --> 04:25.665
and they will pick up
a flag of any colour!

04:28.166 --> 04:30.540
What kind of poverty
is this, friends..

04:31.166 --> 04:35.207
which, in spite of their
schemes funded by millions..

04:35.208 --> 04:37.832
..billions of rupees..

04:37.833 --> 04:39.790
just refuses to go away!

04:43.625 --> 04:46.290
So as of this moment..!
- Sir will leave now.

04:46.291 --> 04:50.124
..we absolve you of any
worry about our poverty

04:50.125 --> 04:52.332
Enough is enough!

04:54.875 --> 04:56.207
Come on, uncle.

04:57.875 --> 04:58.999
Switch the mikes off.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.124
As soon as the ballot is cast,
you throttle democracy.

05:06.541 --> 05:08.457
Don't be under any illusion that..

05:14.583 --> 05:16.082
Have you no shame at all!

05:16.083 --> 05:18.832
Conspiring against your own father!

05:19.625 --> 05:23.249
Do you know that your revered
leader is not worth even a penny!

05:23.708 --> 05:26.207
What l do know is that for you
people's worth is measured..

05:26.208 --> 05:27.832
..only with money.

05:27.833 --> 05:28.999
Shut up!

05:31.541 --> 05:32.790
What?

05:35.041 --> 05:39.457
There is no Comrade Bharati here.
Don't ever call here again!

05:43.791 --> 05:44.999
Sir?

05:45.000 --> 05:46.207
What are you doing?

05:46.208 --> 05:48.124
Cooking khichdi..
Will you have some?

05:48.125 --> 05:50.040
- Here, allow me..
- lf you cook this..

05:50.041 --> 05:52.832
Oh, come on.. Just let me..

05:54.625 --> 05:57.915
lt's going to rain.
Let me drop you home.

06:08.666 --> 06:11.874
- Are you crazy?
- lt's the first rain, sir.

06:12.750 --> 06:14.249
l love the rain.

06:15.250 --> 06:16.707
Why don't you join me?

06:17.250 --> 06:20.374
Don't be childish..
you'll catch cold.

06:20.375 --> 06:22.124
Come on. Get inside.

06:23.791 --> 06:30.832
Listen to me.

06:33.875 --> 06:36.582
You're crazy! You'll catch a cold..

06:36.958 --> 06:38.874
Nothing will happen to me..

07:08.666 --> 07:09.999
Bharati..

07:10.000 --> 07:13.207
l take full
responsibility for what happened.

07:14.708 --> 07:18.874
You devoted
yourself completely to me.

07:20.208 --> 07:21.374
But, l turned out to be weak..

07:21.375 --> 07:23.415
and ended up betraying your trust.

07:24.375 --> 07:26.165
What is done is done.

07:26.541 --> 07:29.874
But, l will never be
free of this guilt.

07:32.291 --> 07:33.540
l'm going..

07:34.958 --> 07:36.874
leaving everything.. and everyone.

07:39.958 --> 07:42.582
l have obviously failed.

07:42.583 --> 07:44.540
My penance awaits me.

07:45.375 --> 07:46.707
Bhaskar.

08:09.166 --> 08:10.624
Get it here, hurry up..

08:23.041 --> 08:25.499
Where's my baby?

08:25.833 --> 08:27.457
Mr. Brij Gopal took him away.

08:28.833 --> 08:30.999
l just wanted to see him once..

08:49.875 --> 08:52.332
Brij Gopal convinced the
grieving Bharati into..

08:52.583 --> 08:55.332
..a marriage with Chandra Pratap.

08:55.333 --> 08:59.332
Of course, it helped that he was
the younger brother of Bhanu Pratap..

08:59.333 --> 09:01.749
the aggressive leader of the
fast-rising Rashtrawadi Party.

09:06.375 --> 09:10.707
No one realised that Brij Gopal had
killed three birds with one stone.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.957
Besides securing Bharati's future..

09:15.166 --> 09:21.457
he also got Ramnath Rai's
doddering party a strong alliance.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.540
And of course, Bhanu
Pratap's Rashtrawadi Party..

09:24.541 --> 09:28.249
harvested a windfall of
much-needed election funds.

09:36.791 --> 09:38.665
Wherever he is, he must be okay.

09:39.416 --> 09:41.082
Just send him your blessings.

09:45.166 --> 09:46.540
O Holy mother Ganga..

09:48.833 --> 09:50.624
please look after my son..

09:53.166 --> 09:54.540
wherever he may be.

09:56.833 --> 10:08.290
- Sooraj! Sooraj!

10:20.583 --> 10:21.832
Where are you going?

10:21.833 --> 10:23.249
Sooraj is playing a kabaddi match.

10:23.250 --> 10:25.457
First give me something to eat.
l have to go to the airport.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.624
Who's coming?

10:26.625 --> 10:28.540
The boss' younger son, Samar.
- ls it?

10:28.541 --> 10:30.874
He is coming from the US,
for the big boss' birthday.

10:47.500 --> 10:51.249
Sooraj is like the sun!
The new beacon of hope for..

10:51.250 --> 10:54.290
..Dalits and the lower castes.

10:54.875 --> 10:59.749
We need bright and strong
young leaders like him..

10:59.750 --> 11:01.957
..who will take us forward.

11:29.833 --> 11:31.874
Hey!

12:21.875 --> 12:23.040
Huh?

12:24.000 --> 12:25.374
Where's the car?

12:27.375 --> 12:28.457
Hey!

12:31.291 --> 12:33.915
Get away! Move!

12:34.666 --> 12:36.040
Have you lost it or what?

12:36.333 --> 12:38.499
What if something
happened to the car?

12:38.500 --> 12:40.582
He's our racing champion..

12:40.583 --> 12:42.040
faster than the wind!

12:42.041 --> 12:43.332
Champion, my foot!

12:43.708 --> 12:45.540
The car's a mess!

12:45.833 --> 12:46.999
Clean it now!

12:47.291 --> 12:51.040
lt's time for the flight. Samar
is returning from the US today.

12:51.833 --> 12:53.124
l don't wash rich people's cars.

12:53.125 --> 12:55.749
They are our masters, son.
Our livelihood depends on them.

12:55.750 --> 12:57.707
l am my own master, father.

12:58.166 --> 13:00.749
And the truth is,
their livelihood depends on us.

13:00.750 --> 13:02.874
lt's impossible to argue with you!

13:02.875 --> 13:06.332
Stop haranguing my son, will you?

13:06.333 --> 13:08.457
- l'll clean it.
- Give it to me, mother.

13:29.083 --> 13:32.665
This is for you.
lt's time you got a new watch.

13:33.583 --> 13:35.665
You never forget, young master.

13:36.916 --> 13:40.582
Just because l live far away,
how can l forget you people!

13:40.791 --> 13:42.707
We miss you, too.

13:43.125 --> 13:45.999
lt's wonderful that you've come
in time for the Diwali festival.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.457
Nothing like that.

13:47.916 --> 13:49.957
l'm here only for
Uncle Bhanu's birthday.

13:49.958 --> 13:51.290
My thesis is due next week.

13:51.291 --> 13:52.499
This year too..

13:52.500 --> 13:53.957
you won't be here for Diwali.

13:58.750 --> 14:00.582
Who's that driving like a maniac?

14:00.583 --> 14:02.124
Appears to be lndu..

14:12.000 --> 14:13.624
Couldn't you have waited for me?

14:13.625 --> 14:14.957
And how was l to
know that you were..

14:14.958 --> 14:16.457
You should know!

14:16.458 --> 14:17.582
Understood?

14:21.041 --> 14:22.249
D'you know..

14:22.625 --> 14:24.415
l was driving at 200
kmph to reach you!

14:24.708 --> 14:26.082
Who on earth gave you a license?

14:26.083 --> 14:27.124
License to..

14:27.666 --> 14:29.749
drive or..

14:30.333 --> 14:32.124
to kiss you?

14:34.083 --> 14:35.290
You're insane!

14:35.291 --> 14:36.749
You're mad.

14:38.458 --> 14:39.707
So l am.

14:40.250 --> 14:41.582
Mad about you!

14:43.875 --> 14:45.249
l missed you.

14:45.250 --> 14:48.874
"l am expecting
some happy news too."

14:50.250 --> 14:51.957
"Yes, it is."

14:54.500 --> 14:57.415
"Some things make you cry..

14:57.416 --> 15:00.790
..some times it is like a story."

15:02.333 --> 15:03.540
"Yes, it is."

15:03.541 --> 15:04.832
There you are!

15:05.500 --> 15:07.832
- Hello aunty!
- Hello.

15:07.833 --> 15:09.999
Here's your parcel
- safe and sound.

15:10.833 --> 15:11.999
l'm off to the salon.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.207
See you in the evening..

15:13.208 --> 15:14.832
at Uncle Bhanu's party.

15:15.541 --> 15:17.040
This girl is a tornado!

15:17.208 --> 15:18.415
ln the last 30 years..

15:18.416 --> 15:21.249
Bhanu and Chandra Pratap's
Rashtrawadi party had captured..

15:21.250 --> 15:23.540
..power thrice in the state.

15:24.250 --> 15:26.124
Bhanu Pratap's public
charisma and Chandra Pratap's..

15:26.125 --> 15:27.707
..astute tactical skills..

15:28.000 --> 15:29.415
had served them well indeed.

15:30.333 --> 15:32.332
When their party
couldn't win the last election..

15:32.333 --> 15:34.915
they installed Ramnath
Rai's party in the government..

15:35.083 --> 15:37.040
by supporting it from outside.

15:40.875 --> 15:43.165
Now, when they asked him to,
Ramnath Rai was reluctant to resign.

15:44.416 --> 15:49.124
Bhanu Pratap's son Veerendra knew
exactly how to handle such problems.

15:49.125 --> 15:52.249
All the dozen legislators
of his party are in the bus.

15:52.500 --> 15:55.457
Take them to the guest
house and feed them.

16:00.708 --> 16:02.457
Welcome, grandpa!

16:07.625 --> 16:11.165
Grandpa, l've hijacked
your entire party.

16:11.333 --> 16:13.082
You're a general without an army!

16:13.083 --> 16:15.124
What's the use of
tilting at windmills now?

16:15.125 --> 16:18.415
Veerendra, show some respect.

16:19.458 --> 16:22.457
Well.. let him
respectfully retire then!

16:24.916 --> 16:28.624
Father-in-law, come.
Let's go inside and talk.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.999
lt's an outrage the way you are..

16:34.208 --> 16:35.707
trying to topple my government!

16:36.291 --> 16:38.540
Only with your blessings, of course.

16:38.541 --> 16:39.915
Look here..

16:39.916 --> 16:42.999
this time my party bosses
will insist on 100 seats.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.374
You can't score even 10 seats..
Aiming for a century!

16:46.916 --> 16:49.290
Keep your national
party in Delhi. Here we..

16:49.291 --> 16:51.832
Veeru, enough.

16:52.416 --> 16:54.332
Come, father-in-law.

16:54.750 --> 16:56.665
You never call me!

16:57.458 --> 16:59.999
lt's only through your Uncle
Brij that l get news of you.

17:00.583 --> 17:03.999
Mother, it's the time
difference between here and America.

17:04.458 --> 17:07.624
Uncle Brij is a nocturnal bird.
lt's easier to talk with him.

17:08.083 --> 17:09.374
Hey!

17:11.375 --> 17:12.707
Brother!

17:18.415 --> 17:20.624
Already pouncing on mom's parathas!

17:21.708 --> 17:23.999
You've become thin! Hasn't he, mom?

17:24.208 --> 17:26.040
Let him be.. Come, eat.

17:26.040 --> 17:28.082
No, l've to go to the Party HQ.

17:28.083 --> 17:30.207
l just came to see him.

17:30.500 --> 17:32.207
While Veerendra believed
himself to be the heir..

17:32.208 --> 17:34.124
..to the political throne..

17:34.416 --> 17:37.457
Prithvi was jockeying
for the same position.

17:38.125 --> 17:40.540
Hence, it was imperative
that his supporters get..

17:40.541 --> 17:42.540
..nominated for these elections.

17:42.750 --> 17:45.790
Create so much publicity that the
party is forced to nominate them.

17:45.791 --> 17:46.999
We'll fight to get that.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.874
We'll create a chaos
in the party high court.

17:48.875 --> 17:50.790
We'll show them your power, Prithvi.

17:50.791 --> 17:51.999
Great!

17:52.000 --> 17:53.290
Let me go!

17:53.291 --> 17:55.624
They're trying to stop me!

17:55.958 --> 17:58.624
l told them l had to talk to you.

17:59.958 --> 18:01.999
We're in a meeting. Please wait.

18:08.458 --> 18:09.790
So.. that's it then.

18:09.791 --> 18:10.000
Yes, sir.

18:10.000 --> 18:10.957
You're Watching 123Movies.to
Yes, sir.

18:10.957 --> 18:12.000
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:12.000 --> 18:14.290
Move then. lt's time for the party.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:14.291 --> 18:15.582
Okay, sir.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:15.582 --> 18:16.041
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:16.041 --> 18:18.707
Jagat.. call for my car, too.
- Okay, sir.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:18.707 --> 18:22.000
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:30.416 --> 18:32.165
You seem to have forgotten me, sir.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.999
There's going to be a
fresh election, l hear.

19:08.916 --> 19:11.874
Won't you let a
woman volunteer contest?

19:16.000 --> 19:18.957
l can win, sir. Just let..

19:21.541 --> 19:24.582
Let me contest from Sitapur.

19:24.791 --> 19:26.332
l'll definitely win.

19:28.958 --> 19:30.624
l grew up there.

19:32.916 --> 19:34.915
l was the students' union president.

19:39.125 --> 19:42.749
Sir, please don't
forget me this time.

19:43.541 --> 19:45.415
The Sitapur ticket..

19:50.666 --> 19:52.499
That's the bloody
problem with politics.

19:53.250 --> 19:56.499
Everyone treats it
like public transport.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.457
Just flag it down..

20:00.000 --> 20:01.540
and mount it!

20:05.583 --> 20:07.582
l've worked very hard, sir.

20:09.083 --> 20:10.790
And will continue to do so.

20:18.416 --> 20:19.874
Let me.

20:20.291 --> 20:22.332
You handled grandpa Rai
like a seasoned politician.

20:22.333 --> 20:24.707
Then, why don't you reward your son?

20:24.708 --> 20:26.582
Everything belongs to him anyway.

20:26.958 --> 20:29.790
Father, let me select
the election candidates.

20:30.875 --> 20:33.999
That's your uncle's prerogative.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.624
That's why Prithvi..

20:36.500 --> 20:38.624
But l won't let it go on like this.

20:52.791 --> 20:54.457
So glad you're here.

20:55.083 --> 20:56.749
lt's your birthday, Uncle.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.624
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

20:58.833 --> 21:00.999
Hello.
- How are you? - Hello.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.624
Mr. Sakseria..

21:03.708 --> 21:04.999
Hello, uncle.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.374
Bless you.
- Hello.

21:07.250 --> 21:11.415
Just got his tax problems
sorted out by the Chief Minister.

21:12.125 --> 21:14.124
You never forget, Rajkumar..

21:15.291 --> 21:17.957
- and now you'll say..
- Happy Birthday to you, sir.

21:18.916 --> 21:20.832
Just saying happy birthday won't do.

21:20.833 --> 21:23.332
Always at your service.
Have l ever disappointed you?

21:34.375 --> 21:41.874
Please be seated.. quiet..

21:42.375 --> 21:44.457
After winning three elections..

21:44.708 --> 21:49.040
when the electorate rejected us..

21:50.583 --> 21:52.540
in the last election..

21:52.541 --> 21:54.665
we accepted their
decision with humility.

21:55.208 --> 21:58.249
And we helped..

21:58.916 --> 22:02.165
Mr. Ramnath Rai form a
coalition government..

22:03.041 --> 22:06.957
supporting it from outside.

22:07.125 --> 22:09.415
But, as you know..

22:09.416 --> 22:11.165
in the last 18 months..

22:11.166 --> 22:14.207
this government has
revealed it's true face.

22:15.166 --> 22:18.040
Corruption has reached its zenith..

22:18.250 --> 22:20.374
and the people are in agony.

22:21.916 --> 22:26.082
We can't bear to see the
common man's pain any longer.

22:26.541 --> 22:30.040
So, we have decided..

22:30.041 --> 22:33.124
to withdraw our support for Mr.
Rai's coalition government.

22:33.750 --> 22:40.665
Long live Rashtrawadi!

22:48.333 --> 22:49.957
The people know..

22:51.000 --> 22:54.040
that we aren't responsible..

22:58.000 --> 23:00.040
for this political turmoil.

23:01.041 --> 23:04.124
Father!
- Brother! - Father! - Brother!

23:04.416 --> 23:05.999
Call the hospital! Emergency..

23:06.000 --> 23:07.624
Get the car!

23:15.250 --> 23:22.832
Hello.

23:22.833 --> 23:25.082
Just as l handed in
the resignation, l heard.

23:25.375 --> 23:27.790
- At least, if l hadn't resigned..
- Father-in-law..

23:28.416 --> 23:29.874
..please!

23:30.666 --> 23:32.457
lncrease the pressure.

23:41.666 --> 23:44.249
Mr. Brij Gopal..

23:55.125 --> 23:57.582
Blood pressure.
- Diastolic 140.

23:57.583 --> 23:59.915
l came from
Benaras only to see you..

23:59.916 --> 24:02.207
and here l hear about this crisis.

24:02.916 --> 24:04.457
lt's serious, Uncle..

24:04.791 --> 24:06.290
l'll see.

24:06.916 --> 24:08.624
Blood pressure.

24:09.166 --> 24:10.707
While the heart has been revived..

24:11.000 --> 24:12.624
there's no movement in the body.

24:12.625 --> 24:14.290
So, is he paralysed?

24:14.291 --> 24:16.290
We'll have to wait for
the ECG reports for that.

24:16.291 --> 24:18.665
The government has fallen and
fresh elections are certain.

24:18.666 --> 24:20.915
But the leader of the
state's largest political party..

24:20.916 --> 24:23.415
is fighting for his life.

24:23.416 --> 24:26.749
- Without party
president Bhanu Pratap..

24:26.750 --> 24:28.832
- what does the future hold
for the Rashtrawadi Party?

24:28.833 --> 24:31.040
- State Hospital.
Aditi Priya. Star News.

24:31.041 --> 24:32.957
Go ahead.

24:37.666 --> 24:40.040
Before they try to pull a fast one..

24:40.041 --> 24:42.582
we should take control of the party.

24:42.583 --> 24:44.165
We support you.

24:44.375 --> 24:46.249
l'll see you all
at the party office.

24:47.291 --> 24:48.624
Yes, Mr. Bawal.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.165
Hello?

24:50.875 --> 24:52.082
What?

24:54.000 --> 24:56.332
Under no circumstances
should that meeting happen.

24:56.333 --> 25:00.249
Book the entire
lntercontinental Hotel.

25:00.250 --> 25:01.540
Got it?

25:02.833 --> 25:04.374
Listen..

25:04.375 --> 25:08.540
round up every party member
and take them to the hotel.

25:19.166 --> 25:22.165
These impatient youngsters
will destroy everything.

25:23.583 --> 25:27.457
Now, more than ever, the
party needs your guidance.

25:36.666 --> 25:39.582
Turn around. Father has
regained consciousness.

25:46.500 --> 25:48.957
As soon as he became conscious,
he called for everybody.

25:52.333 --> 25:53.790
Chandu..

25:55.208 --> 25:57.332
Yes, brother..
- The..

25:58.666 --> 26:01.707
ln these circumstances, the party..

26:01.708 --> 26:03.374
Brother, please, we'll talk later..

26:03.375 --> 26:08.749
- What?
- take charge of.. the party..

26:10.291 --> 26:13.332
as it's working president.

26:13.333 --> 26:15.415
What's the need for this, father?

26:15.416 --> 26:16.582
You..

26:18.125 --> 26:19.999
and Prithvi..

26:23.000 --> 26:26.540
will both be general secretaries.

26:26.541 --> 26:28.040
Uncle!

26:30.666 --> 26:33.374
Come on..

26:36.791 --> 26:38.624
What have you done, father!

26:39.333 --> 26:41.957
Take it back! Please..

26:43.083 --> 26:46.457
This is a humiliation for me..

26:48.041 --> 26:50.332
At least, make me the
joint working president..

26:50.333 --> 26:53.749
Veerendra.. you're family!
You should look beyond such things.

26:53.750 --> 26:55.707
Everything will finish, then..

26:55.708 --> 26:57.290
Father..

26:57.291 --> 27:00.540
Father!

27:17.125 --> 27:18.624
Go back..

27:19.500 --> 27:20.999
back to America..

27:25.041 --> 27:28.249
- Long live Prithvi!

27:28.250 --> 27:31.332
- Long live the General Secretary!

27:31.333 --> 27:34.374
- Long live Prithvi!

27:34.375 --> 27:40.749
- Long live the General Secretary!

27:40.916 --> 27:43.999
- Long live Prithvi!

27:45.041 --> 27:47.124
- Long live the General Secretary!

27:47.708 --> 27:49.040
Hi!

28:14.541 --> 28:15.790
Miss you.

28:20.208 --> 28:24.332
l want us to discuss
each candidate thoroughly.

28:24.791 --> 28:28.374
l have already made the list.
Just approve it!

28:31.375 --> 28:34.749
Veerendra, our party
follows a democratic process.

28:34.958 --> 28:37.165
Each and every
recommendation is discussed.

28:37.166 --> 28:42.040
Will you be kind enough to tell us,
which democratic process..

28:42.291 --> 28:44.874
was followed to make you
the working president?

28:44.875 --> 28:46.499
Uncle..

28:47.166 --> 28:49.040
the very president by whose grace..

28:49.041 --> 28:50.999
you're adorning that chair..

28:51.791 --> 28:53.665
has seen this list.

28:54.875 --> 28:57.082
Then, surely you have
his approval in writing.

28:58.500 --> 29:00.540
This list will prevail!

29:01.916 --> 29:04.124
Discuss all you want.

29:04.916 --> 29:08.540
How come you've put your
name against Madhopur?

29:09.000 --> 29:11.749
Mr. Bhanu Pratap has
always contested from Madhopur.

29:11.750 --> 29:14.290
And in father's absence,
the seat is rightfully..

29:14.291 --> 29:16.874
No claim for Madhopur
will be entertained.

29:17.541 --> 29:19.915
lt is reserved for
the party president.

29:19.916 --> 29:22.790
And currently,
that is Chandra Pratap.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.999
Only the party president
should contest from Madhopur.

29:28.583 --> 29:32.124
Have you even fought a
municipal election..

29:32.666 --> 29:34.665
that you're staking
your claim to Madhopur?!

29:34.666 --> 29:37.374
l will never let
your dream come true..

29:37.375 --> 29:39.624
Honourable Working President!

29:46.000 --> 29:54.874
- Long live Prithvi!

29:57.625 --> 30:02.415
He's here! The leader is here!

30:02.416 --> 30:07.707
He's come to Azad Nagar.
We all welcome him here.

30:07.708 --> 30:13.499
The people of Azad Nagar whole
heartedly welcome the leader.

30:13.500 --> 30:24.540
- Long live Prithvi!

30:26.041 --> 30:28.040
Everyone knows that..

30:28.666 --> 30:29.999
30 years ago..

30:30.000 --> 30:32.832
our party reclaimed this land from
the government and their agents..

30:32.833 --> 30:36.457
and established Azad Nagar!

30:39.291 --> 30:41.499
My heart beats for..

30:41.500 --> 30:44.332
the poor and the lower castes..

30:52.708 --> 30:53.915
Who is this?

30:53.916 --> 30:57.457
Our driver's son
- Sooraj.

30:57.458 --> 30:59.249
Also a kabaddi champion.

30:59.833 --> 31:02.874
This isn't a dance party.
Tell them to stop.

31:08.666 --> 31:12.457
l want that the
candidate for Azad Nagar..

31:13.750 --> 31:16.832
should be educated, able and..

31:16.833 --> 31:18.082
from amongst you.

31:18.083 --> 31:26.499
Sooraj is our leader!

31:26.500 --> 31:28.707
Yeah.. okay.. okay..

31:29.875 --> 31:34.290
The Rashtrawadi Party
candidate for Azad Nagar will be..

31:35.416 --> 31:36.749
Jeevan Kumar!

31:42.000 --> 31:44.290
Jeevan Kumar may
belong to our caste..

31:44.916 --> 31:46.749
but that doesn't
necessarily make him one of us.

31:47.041 --> 31:51.040
He knows nothing about Azad Nagar.

31:51.583 --> 31:54.332
He's never set foot
in our dirty lanes..

31:54.333 --> 31:56.915
and nor will he, once
the elections are over.

31:56.916 --> 31:58.332
Excuse me?

31:58.333 --> 32:00.332
Mr. General Secretary..

32:01.000 --> 32:03.290
our candidate will be one of us!

32:04.375 --> 32:06.165
Not an outsider.

32:06.375 --> 32:08.249
This isn't a kabaddi match.

32:08.583 --> 32:11.207
l am speaking of the
Legislative Assembly election.

32:11.416 --> 32:14.124
And the Rashtrawadi
candidate will definitely be..

32:14.750 --> 32:16.290
Jeevan Kumar.

32:16.291 --> 32:18.290
- We protest!

32:18.291 --> 32:19.999
- We don't want outsiders!

32:20.000 --> 32:21.332
- We protest!

32:21.333 --> 32:22.915
We don't want outsiders!

32:22.916 --> 32:36.790
Long live Sooraj!

32:36.791 --> 32:41.207
Long live!
- Prithvi!

32:41.208 --> 32:43.124
Try to understand.

32:43.125 --> 32:45.624
You're not aware that
Jeevan Kumar's grandfather..

32:45.625 --> 32:47.499
was a minister in
the Central government.

32:47.500 --> 32:48.665
So?

32:49.000 --> 32:51.124
That makes it his birthright,
does it?

32:51.958 --> 32:53.707
What does he know about us?!

32:53.708 --> 32:56.290
Educated abroad..

32:58.541 --> 33:01.582
he owns four Mercedes cars of
the kind that you chauffeur, dad!

33:01.583 --> 33:03.832
He wouldn't last a day here!

33:03.833 --> 33:05.415
How is he one of us!

33:05.708 --> 33:06.999
Enough is enough!

33:07.000 --> 33:08.332
lt's do or die this time.

33:08.333 --> 33:10.790
What is it that you people want?

33:10.791 --> 33:13.290
Whose job is it to select the
candidate - yours or the party's?

33:13.291 --> 33:15.207
We'll choose our own candidate!

33:15.208 --> 33:16.665
What?

33:16.666 --> 33:17.749
You'll rebel against the party?

33:17.916 --> 33:20.249
Without the party,
you won't garner five votes.

33:20.625 --> 33:23.332
lnstead, you'll end up
dividing the lower caste votes.

33:23.333 --> 33:24.832
So what do you suggest?

33:24.833 --> 33:26.582
That we continue to suck up..

33:26.583 --> 33:27.957
to these politicians..

33:28.250 --> 33:30.124
while they plant
their leaders on us?

33:30.583 --> 33:32.957
lt isn't like that, son.

33:33.125 --> 33:34.915
The party cares for us.

33:35.208 --> 33:36.790
They treat us like equals.

33:37.041 --> 33:38.915
Look, Samar came just for a day..

33:39.125 --> 33:41.124
but he got me a new watch.

33:41.625 --> 33:43.290
- a watch?
- Yes.

33:43.625 --> 33:45.082
So that you report to work on time.

33:45.083 --> 33:47.165
That's the problem with you guys.

33:47.375 --> 33:50.874
You've barely learnt to walk,
but want to fly!

33:50.875 --> 33:53.624
You guys are history!

33:53.625 --> 33:55.207
We generate the power.

33:55.208 --> 33:57.249
Then why should we
hand them the switch?

33:59.250 --> 34:02.582
From now on, no outside
candidates allowed in Azad Nagar!

34:03.291 --> 34:06.249
- Who ls our leader?
- Sooraj, Sooraj.

34:06.250 --> 34:09.623
- Victory to Sooraj!

34:09.625 --> 34:13.456
- Long live Sooraj!

34:18.416 --> 34:20.123
Do you know me?

34:21.250 --> 34:22.956
You're a big man.

34:24.833 --> 34:27.665
How is a nobody like me
supposed to know you, Mr. Babulal?

34:29.208 --> 34:31.123
l like your attitude.

34:32.791 --> 34:36.706
But, these speeches and
stunts will get you nowhere.

34:38.291 --> 34:40.998
Even if you win the election
as an independent.. big deal!

34:42.791 --> 34:45.790
lnstead the party will
punish Azad Nagar for its defeat.

34:48.916 --> 34:52.956
lf you really want to change
anything, join the party..

34:53.833 --> 34:55.373
and fight as its candidate.

35:10.250 --> 35:11.499
Come on!

35:11.500 --> 35:12.624
Get down.

35:13.208 --> 35:16.082
You know, l'm going to
contest the elections this time.

35:16.375 --> 35:20.624
And you'll see, l'll become
the youngest woman minister ever.

35:21.083 --> 35:22.707
- Really?
- Of course!

35:22.708 --> 35:24.124
And when you come the next time..

35:24.125 --> 35:26.082
l'll come to receive you in a
car with a flashing red light.

35:30.291 --> 35:31.499
- Wow!

35:32.666 --> 35:34.415
Such a grand lunch for
one measly vote of mine?

35:34.750 --> 35:37.290
For your vote?!

35:37.291 --> 35:40.332
Can't you be a little romantic?

35:40.958 --> 35:42.624
- With you?
- No..

35:43.000 --> 35:44.499
with this waiter!

35:44.833 --> 35:47.249
Look here, don't ruin my mood.

35:48.083 --> 35:52.040
l want to have a serious chat.

35:55.125 --> 35:56.582
That's very serious.

36:00.250 --> 36:01.499
Stop, stop!

36:03.083 --> 36:04.457
Not just like that.

36:04.458 --> 36:07.582
First propose.

36:08.333 --> 36:09.665
Okay..

36:10.000 --> 36:13.457
Let's drink to your
flashing red light.

36:13.958 --> 36:15.290
- Red light?
- Yes.

36:15.625 --> 36:17.999
When you become a minister..

36:18.000 --> 36:20.749
you will have a car with a
flashing red light, won't you?

36:21.333 --> 36:22.707
Samar!

36:23.041 --> 36:24.957
When are we getting married?

36:27.750 --> 36:29.332
Why do you look so shocked?

36:31.125 --> 36:32.540
Marriage..

36:32.958 --> 36:34.290
l..

36:34.583 --> 36:36.082
l didn't quite understand.

36:36.083 --> 36:40.374
You'll understand alright when
the priest recites the vows..

36:40.833 --> 36:42.624
and l make you take 17
rounds of the sacred fire..

36:42.625 --> 36:43.749
Stop, stop!

36:45.000 --> 36:46.207
lndu..

36:47.500 --> 36:49.165
l know how you feel about me.

36:49.875 --> 36:51.915
But my feelings aren't
the same for you, lndu.

36:53.750 --> 36:55.374
l mean, you're an amazing girl.

36:56.416 --> 36:57.790
So beautiful..

36:57.791 --> 36:59.624
full of life.. honest..

37:00.208 --> 37:01.457
just lovely, but..

37:01.458 --> 37:03.207
You can't love me!

37:05.833 --> 37:09.290
Do you know this is the first
time you've complimented me?

37:10.000 --> 37:11.916
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:11.916 --> 37:14.665
Beautiful, amazing..
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:14.665 --> 37:15.416
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:15.416 --> 37:16.957
full of life..
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:16.957 --> 37:17.458
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:17.458 --> 37:21.207
You can say all this but..
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:21.207 --> 37:21.541
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:21.541 --> 37:22.000
you can't utter three words..
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:22.000 --> 37:24.165
you can't utter three words..

37:24.166 --> 37:25.582
l love you.

37:26.125 --> 37:27.540
And here l am..

37:28.250 --> 37:29.790
madly in love with you..

37:31.208 --> 37:34.124
since childhood.

37:37.416 --> 37:38.624
l'm sorry.

37:39.083 --> 37:40.957
l won't be able to forgive myself.

37:44.875 --> 37:47.665
Have you never loved me?

37:49.000 --> 37:50.749
We're just too different, lndu.

38:00.625 --> 38:10.207
Long live Rashtrawadi!

38:10.458 --> 38:14.332
l have a simple question
for the Working President:

38:14.791 --> 38:17.499
On what basis were
the candidates chosen?

38:17.958 --> 38:20.707
Answer this first: On what basis..

38:20.708 --> 38:22.624
did you announce your
name from the Madhopur seat?

38:22.625 --> 38:23.915
Prithvi Pratap.

38:25.083 --> 38:26.207
Veerendra..

38:26.458 --> 38:30.249
you're well aware that the
core committee discusses..

38:30.250 --> 38:31.749
every candidature
before taking any decision.

38:31.750 --> 38:33.249
l want to say something.

38:37.666 --> 38:38.874
You?

38:39.916 --> 38:41.374
What the hell are you doing here?

38:41.833 --> 38:43.415
My name is Sooraj.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.249
l'm from Azad Nagar.

38:45.250 --> 38:47.290
Yeah.. yeah.. The kabaddi champ!

38:47.666 --> 38:48.999
- But, what Are you doing here?

38:49.000 --> 38:50.624
l want a ticket to
contest the election.

38:50.625 --> 38:51.999
Really now!

38:52.000 --> 38:53.582
We're running a charity fete here!

38:53.583 --> 38:55.124
You want a ticket, do you?

38:55.875 --> 38:57.582
Didn't you hear me..

38:58.416 --> 39:01.040
when you were busy dancing around?

39:02.000 --> 39:05.999
Our party's candidate for
Azad Nagar is Jeevan Kumar.

39:06.375 --> 39:07.874
Got that?

39:08.583 --> 39:09.999
Get out now!

39:10.000 --> 39:11.290
Security!

39:13.875 --> 39:15.332
l had heard you.

39:16.666 --> 39:19.499
But perhaps, you could
neither hear nor see that..

39:19.500 --> 39:23.582
the people of Azad Nagar
rejected your candidate instantly.

39:24.083 --> 39:26.082
l'm the leader of the lower castes..

39:27.583 --> 39:28.790
and they will support only me.

39:28.958 --> 39:30.165
What did you say!

39:30.166 --> 39:31.749
Who made you our leader?

39:31.750 --> 39:33.832
We sweated blood for the party..

39:33.833 --> 39:35.207
but suddenly you
become the leader, is it?

39:35.208 --> 39:37.040
Everyone knows where..

39:37.041 --> 39:39.332
the fruits of your sweat are hidden.

39:39.791 --> 39:41.582
We'll make you account
for that too one day!

39:41.583 --> 39:44.290
For now, l only want a
ticket to contest from Azad Nagar.

39:44.291 --> 39:46.499
You'll take us to task, will you?

39:46.500 --> 39:48.332
l'll show you.

39:48.666 --> 39:50.832
Son, what are you doing!

39:51.250 --> 39:52.832
ls this the way to speak here?

39:52.833 --> 39:54.957
Please, Sirs..
l apologise on his behalf.

39:55.500 --> 39:57.374
- Come..
- Father, please..

39:57.375 --> 39:58.540
Keep quiet now. Enough!

39:58.541 --> 40:00.207
- Get him out of here!
- Throw him out!

40:00.208 --> 40:01.624
Take him away.

40:01.875 --> 40:03.499
- He thinks He can
contest an election.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.374
Learn to drive instead
of dreaming of leadership.

40:09.041 --> 40:10.374
Security!
- Come on.

40:10.375 --> 40:12.124
He isn't going anywhere!

40:14.958 --> 40:17.832
- He stays here.
- here? Meaning?

40:17.833 --> 40:19.665
lt's clear, Prithviraj.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.040
Sooraj happens to be a
member of the core committee.

40:22.625 --> 40:25.457
- No one can throw him out.
- What is this nonsense!

40:25.458 --> 40:26.957
Who made him a member?

40:27.625 --> 40:28.915
l did.

40:29.625 --> 40:32.832
The secretary of the
backward and minority cell.

40:32.833 --> 40:35.540
- But, Mr. Veerendra..
- Please read the constitution.

40:36.291 --> 40:39.290
As General Secretary,
l have the right to..

40:39.291 --> 40:41.540
nominate three members.

40:43.833 --> 40:45.165
Excuse me.

40:45.166 --> 40:46.415
Come, Sooraj.

40:47.708 --> 40:49.832
Please place a chair
for him beside mine.

41:04.041 --> 41:05.832
Please sit.

41:11.625 --> 41:13.540
Respected Mr. Working President..

41:14.458 --> 41:16.499
please caution Mr. Prithviraj that..

41:16.916 --> 41:18.957
without the approval
of the core committee..

41:19.250 --> 41:22.332
he shouldn't go around
announcing candidates.

41:24.708 --> 41:26.332
And l propose..

41:26.791 --> 41:29.624
that instead of Jeevan Kumar..

41:30.291 --> 41:32.207
the party
candidate from Azad Nagar..

41:32.208 --> 41:35.624
should be Sooraj Kumar.

41:43.458 --> 41:46.082
Adjourned the meeting for now.

41:52.333 --> 41:55.457
The new proposals will have
to be included in the agenda.

41:56.125 --> 41:59.832
Hence, this meeting is
adjourned until further notice.

42:04.333 --> 42:05.582
Take this.

42:09.208 --> 42:10.999
l'm feeling
handicapped without Bhanu.

42:12.458 --> 42:14.624
lt's becoming very
hard to rein in Veerendra.

42:16.416 --> 42:19.499
He staked his claim to
Madhopur again today.

42:19.500 --> 42:22.249
So? Let him contest.

42:22.500 --> 42:24.915
C'mon, Uncle.. You know
that Madhopur is reserved..

42:24.916 --> 42:27.040
..for the party president.

42:27.291 --> 42:29.374
lf he wins from there,
he'll create havoc.

42:30.916 --> 42:32.374
He can even lose.

42:33.916 --> 42:37.124
Are you aware that
it is our safest seat?

42:37.416 --> 42:39.832
Even if we nominate a dog
from there, it will win.

42:40.125 --> 42:43.415
Brother, if the party can
make you win the election..

42:44.708 --> 42:46.290
it can also make sure you lose.

42:49.125 --> 42:53.332
Sure. But losing Madhopur
isn't good for the party.

42:53.333 --> 42:54.957
Precisely!

42:55.416 --> 42:59.040
lf he loses from there,
it'll finish his political career.

43:00.541 --> 43:05.124
Moreover, you'll get sympathy
for giving up the seat.

43:05.916 --> 43:07.207
That makes sense.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.124
But your problem isn't Veerendra.

43:10.708 --> 43:12.165
lt is Sooraj!

43:16.583 --> 43:18.624
He has created a serious situation.

43:20.333 --> 43:24.040
lf we give him Azad Nagar,
it boosts Veerendra's position.

43:24.875 --> 43:27.832
But, if we don't,
we antagonise the lower castes.

43:30.375 --> 43:31.915
l don't know what to do.

43:40.125 --> 43:42.290
We'll talk in one voice.
- Sooraj, Mr. Brij Gopal is here.

43:43.583 --> 43:45.040
Brij Gopal?

43:46.500 --> 43:47.874
How are you all?

43:51.208 --> 43:52.790
Hello.
- Okay, fine.

43:53.333 --> 43:55.790
Sir!

43:56.625 --> 43:58.832
Been a while since
l had a cup of your tea.

43:58.833 --> 44:02.540
How nice! Mr. Batukeshwar, you too?

44:03.375 --> 44:06.082
Looks like all the Dalits are here!

44:06.083 --> 44:08.165
Looks like a massive convention.

44:08.166 --> 44:10.665
Since elections are upon us..

44:10.666 --> 44:12.332
we need to look at
all possibilities.

44:12.333 --> 44:16.165
Of course, of course. After all,
this is the age of the youth.

44:17.125 --> 44:19.415
Please sit..

44:19.875 --> 44:23.082
No matter what,
we will never leave the party.

44:23.083 --> 44:25.165
The party is yours anyway.

44:25.166 --> 44:27.790
As far as
elections go, you're right.

44:28.375 --> 44:29.540
But, what about after that?

44:29.541 --> 44:32.457
l know that you
people are upset about..

44:32.458 --> 44:34.332
..the selection of your candidate.

44:34.333 --> 44:36.124
We have decided..

44:36.375 --> 44:39.582
that not just for Azad Nagar,
but every lower caste area..

44:39.583 --> 44:41.540
we only want local candidates.

44:41.541 --> 44:43.290
That is up to the party.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.415
Now that you're in
the core committee..

44:47.000 --> 44:48.749
raise this issue there.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.665
For now, the party president
has sent me to inform you that..

44:51.666 --> 44:56.332
the candidate for Azad Nagar
will be from among you.

44:59.750 --> 45:01.415
God bless you, Mr. Brij Gopal.

45:01.708 --> 45:04.165
As long as you are in the party..

45:04.708 --> 45:06.249
there will be no injustice.

45:06.250 --> 45:08.124
Bless you, Sir..

45:09.916 --> 45:12.249
for encouraging a poor man's son.

45:13.625 --> 45:15.499
Sooraj will not disappoint you.

45:15.500 --> 45:24.082
Victory to Sooraj!
Victory to Sooraj!

45:24.083 --> 45:28.957
The party has decided that
the candidate from Azad Nagar..

45:29.416 --> 45:32.957
will be the party's loyal supporter,
and your beloved..

45:37.041 --> 45:39.040
Ram Charittar!

45:42.083 --> 45:44.957
Democracy is alive
and well in our party.

45:46.500 --> 45:48.749
Sir, this is a mistake.

45:49.000 --> 45:52.832
The candidate is not me.
lt's my son, Sooraj.

45:52.833 --> 45:56.040
Ram Charittar, every father
wants his son to move ahead.

45:56.041 --> 45:58.249
But he is still inexperienced.

45:58.250 --> 46:00.790
And is there anyone here who is..

46:00.791 --> 46:03.207
more honest and
hardworking than you?

46:04.333 --> 46:06.874
Does anyone have an objection,
friends?

46:08.333 --> 46:11.832
Tell me, Sooraj.. Do you object
to your father's candidature?

46:20.041 --> 46:22.499
Why don't you people say something?

46:24.000 --> 46:25.124
Sir..

46:25.333 --> 46:27.124
how can l be a candidate?

46:27.666 --> 46:29.415
l'm a mere servant of your family.

46:29.416 --> 46:30.957
Now, you are a
servant of the people.

46:31.375 --> 46:32.665
Sir, please..

47:00.916 --> 47:03.624
The decision to nominate
my father was the right one.

47:05.708 --> 47:08.665
ln politics, there are no
right or wrong decisions.

47:09.333 --> 47:12.082
Their purpose is merely to
achieve a desired result.

47:12.958 --> 47:14.499
Whatever that might be.

47:15.625 --> 47:17.124
l shall remember that.

47:21.375 --> 47:23.457
Let's go.

47:40.291 --> 47:42.540
l'm going to Beesanpur temple..

47:42.541 --> 47:44.999
to pray for your nomination.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.874
But, why today?

47:47.125 --> 47:49.582
Because it's your day off.

47:49.583 --> 47:51.540
Father's on a long vacation now.

47:51.541 --> 47:53.290
He will no longer be a chauffeur.

47:53.291 --> 47:54.749
What?!

47:55.208 --> 47:56.665
l have decided.

47:56.666 --> 47:58.499
You're not going to
serve that family.

47:58.500 --> 48:00.040
Take the car to Beesanpur.

48:00.458 --> 48:02.290
We'll take the bus, son.

48:03.250 --> 48:05.332
The first list of candidates.
- Hello, sir.

48:05.666 --> 48:08.082
You proposed 55 names.
Of those, he cleared only 12!

48:11.583 --> 48:12.874
And, my request for funds?

48:13.250 --> 48:14.957
He refused to clear them.

48:16.583 --> 48:18.790
He will pay for this!

48:20.333 --> 48:21.790
Bad times are here.

48:22.041 --> 48:24.624
We conducted a
survey in every district.

48:24.625 --> 48:27.332
78% of the voters..

48:27.833 --> 48:29.874
connect with Chandra Pratap.

48:30.208 --> 48:31.915
He is the face of our party.

48:43.083 --> 48:46.124
Chief Minister designate!

48:46.125 --> 48:47.415
Why not?

48:47.416 --> 48:50.790
The party will decide that. Not you!

48:51.083 --> 48:53.749
- Shut up.
- No, you be quiet!

48:54.541 --> 48:57.915
This is the party office,
not your home.

48:59.041 --> 49:00.665
Respect the decorum of this office.

49:00.666 --> 49:02.874
So, you'll teach me decorum,
will you?

49:03.875 --> 49:06.499
Mr. Backward and
Minority Cell Secretary..

49:07.000 --> 49:08.790
The party has decided.

49:09.291 --> 49:11.082
He will be the Chief Minister!

49:11.791 --> 49:13.957
lf you have a problem with that..

49:14.875 --> 49:18.624
The public recognises
only one face..

49:21.791 --> 49:24.040
only one voice..

49:25.791 --> 49:27.582
that of Bhanu Pratap.

49:29.333 --> 49:35.290
And you all know who..
his rightful successor is.

49:36.708 --> 49:39.165
The party should not
fail to recognise that.

49:40.333 --> 49:41.999
Veerendra..

49:43.250 --> 49:48.124
your father has himself
approved of this decision.

49:57.041 --> 49:58.790
When did father decide this?

49:58.791 --> 50:01.457
This morning.

50:02.125 --> 50:06.790
Every decision of this party
is democratic. You know that!

50:06.791 --> 50:08.207
Of course!

50:08.208 --> 50:11.749
l know.. who is behind all this.

50:12.166 --> 50:15.624
How only 12 of my
55 candidates are approved.

50:16.583 --> 50:20.040
How all my demands for
funds are consistently denied.

50:22.791 --> 50:24.665
Mr. Working President..

50:25.791 --> 50:27.999
this decision is not
good for the party.

50:29.708 --> 50:31.915
The people will reject it!

50:32.833 --> 50:36.249
Young man,
now l call the shots here.

50:37.083 --> 50:39.540
Learn to accept that fact.

50:41.125 --> 50:44.499
Better fall in line or
fall by the wayside.

50:45.916 --> 50:47.457
Fall in line?!

50:50.166 --> 50:52.124
Wow, Mr. Working President!

50:52.125 --> 50:55.499
Enough, Veerendra Pratap!
Final warning.

50:56.541 --> 51:00.957
The same constitution
that gives you the right..

51:01.708 --> 51:04.374
to appoint him a member..
also grants me the right..

51:04.375 --> 51:07.374
to suspend you from the party.

51:08.708 --> 51:10.040
Sir..

51:10.041 --> 51:12.290
Veerendra is the general
secretary of the party.

51:12.291 --> 51:13.582
How can you..

51:13.583 --> 51:15.249
So now, you'll interfere, will you?

51:17.041 --> 51:18.332
l've been watching..

51:19.041 --> 51:21.665
the kind of games that
some people are playing.

51:23.000 --> 51:25.082
Looks like some
players will have to be..

51:25.083 --> 51:26.665
rested during this
election tournament.

52:01.333 --> 52:03.415
Fall in line!

52:05.791 --> 52:10.457
Now l have to stand in line, eh?

52:12.666 --> 52:16.707
All my life, l doled out alms..

52:18.541 --> 52:22.374
now l have to
stand in line and beg?!

52:24.791 --> 52:29.082
My father built this party..

52:30.375 --> 52:32.874
and he is trying to
kick me out of it?

52:37.708 --> 52:39.249
l'll break it!

52:41.541 --> 52:43.874
l will break this party..

52:43.875 --> 52:45.874
and form a new one.

52:45.875 --> 52:47.582
Do not make that mistake.

52:49.416 --> 52:51.124
That is what they want.

52:51.458 --> 52:53.040
This party is yours.

52:53.041 --> 52:55.332
They must leave, not you!

52:55.333 --> 52:57.082
How will you throw them out?

52:58.583 --> 53:00.249
How?

53:01.166 --> 53:02.915
See this poster?

53:04.000 --> 53:06.290
This man will become
the Chief Minister!

53:12.000 --> 53:13.915
l'll change the poster.

53:18.458 --> 53:20.665
- Mr. Chandra Pratap ls here.

53:23.041 --> 53:25.582
You're off already, son?

53:25.583 --> 53:26.749
Yes, it is okay, father.

53:26.916 --> 53:28.040
Why are you so concerned?

53:28.041 --> 53:30.165
As if you've had any time for him!

53:30.958 --> 53:33.374
You know how things have been..

53:35.791 --> 53:37.165
There's time still.

53:37.750 --> 53:39.915
Put Samar's luggage in my car.
- Okay, sir.

53:40.916 --> 53:43.457
- l'll drop him.
- You?

53:43.708 --> 53:45.624
Papa, you don't have to do this.

53:48.208 --> 53:49.499
Come.

53:49.500 --> 53:51.707
This time l really didn't
get to see you properly.

53:52.583 --> 53:54.249
Everything okay there?

53:54.250 --> 53:55.874
Your PhD?

53:56.458 --> 53:59.707
l'm done with the research.
The presentation is next week.

54:00.041 --> 54:01.749
- Next week?
- Yes, papa.

54:02.208 --> 54:03.749
l'm done with my PhD.

54:04.000 --> 54:05.332
Fantastic!

54:07.458 --> 54:10.582
So, now we'll be calling you
Dr. Samar Pratap!

54:14.791 --> 54:18.415
Tell me the title of your thesis
again. l always seem to forget..

54:19.333 --> 54:22.707
The Sub-textual Emotional Violence
of 19th Century Victorian Poetry.

54:24.000 --> 54:25.374
Wonderful!

54:25.916 --> 54:27.624
Sounds so impressive.

54:29.125 --> 54:30.707
What next?

54:32.000 --> 54:34.457
There's an offer to teach.

54:35.375 --> 54:37.415
So you aren't coming back?

54:38.666 --> 54:41.207
Well.. l suppose that's fine too.

54:42.500 --> 54:44.915
You'll be the first
teacher in our family.

54:59.250 --> 55:01.665
Papa, please.. you should go now.

55:02.791 --> 55:04.415
This security thing is too much.

55:04.416 --> 55:05.790
l'll go.

55:05.791 --> 55:07.624
- Let me see you in..
- No papa. please..

55:08.000 --> 55:09.915
You're blocking the traffic also.

55:11.333 --> 55:12.499
Okay, son.

55:13.958 --> 55:17.165
Come, give me a hug.

55:17.375 --> 55:19.249
God knows when l'll see you again.

55:20.500 --> 55:21.915
These elections..

55:27.041 --> 55:28.415
Father..

55:31.625 --> 55:33.082
Love you, son.

55:38.916 --> 55:40.165
What is it, Babulal?

55:40.666 --> 55:42.957
Mr. Bhanu's condition
has suddenly worsened.

55:44.041 --> 55:46.582
We're going to the hospital.

55:46.583 --> 55:48.457
Have the doctor call me.

55:49.000 --> 55:50.290
Okay.

55:51.833 --> 55:53.374
Take me to the hospital!

55:54.958 --> 56:01.415
"My beloved isn't speaking to me."

56:03.333 --> 56:07.749
"Doors of the heart."

56:08.208 --> 56:09.624
What were you thinking?

56:11.041 --> 56:12.749
l'm not some tragedy queen.

56:13.291 --> 56:15.999
l'll abduct you from across the
universe, if that's what it takes.

56:17.041 --> 56:18.290
Really?

56:19.041 --> 56:20.874
New profession?

56:22.375 --> 56:28.665
"My beloved isn't speaking to me."

56:29.416 --> 56:31.207
l can't live without you.

56:33.541 --> 56:34.915
l love you.

56:39.791 --> 56:41.207
lndu, l've to go.

56:43.750 --> 56:44.874
Take care.

57:00.458 --> 57:03.207
Find out what's going on!
- Security, come in.

57:10.000 --> 57:18.125
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:18.125 --> 57:22.000
Get them to move.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:22.000 --> 57:23.999
Get them to move.

57:25.458 --> 57:27.207
Clear the road..

57:46.916 --> 57:51.124
Another shocking setback to
the state's most powerful family.

57:51.125 --> 57:52.999
According to initial reports..

57:53.000 --> 57:57.374
The working president of
the Rashtrawadi party..

57:57.375 --> 57:58.790
- Mr. Chandra Pratap..

57:58.791 --> 58:00.332
- was fatally attacked
in a shocking incident.

58:00.333 --> 58:02.749
Reports state that this attack..

58:02.958 --> 58:06.332
took place on Ratanpur road on the
way to the city from the airport.

58:06.333 --> 58:09.415
Mr. Chandra Pratap was in his
car when the attack took place.

58:09.416 --> 58:12.249
lt seems that he was shot.

58:12.458 --> 58:16.999
As a result of the incident
traffic is blocked for miles.

58:17.375 --> 58:19.790
- there ls No information
about his condition.

58:19.791 --> 58:21.707
Mr. Brij Gopal for you..

58:22.708 --> 58:24.374
Uncle! How's papa?

58:24.375 --> 58:26.124
They've taken him to the hospital.

58:26.125 --> 58:28.790
l'll pick you up at the airport.

58:29.000 --> 58:30.332
Get the cars!

58:30.333 --> 58:31.624
That will take time,
l'll come by cab..

58:31.625 --> 58:33.332
Just do as l say!

58:33.333 --> 58:35.874
Those who have done this,
know that you're at the airport.

58:35.875 --> 58:37.499
You just stay there!

58:39.583 --> 58:41.249
Disconnect the cable TV..

58:41.500 --> 58:42.874
Security on red alert.

58:42.875 --> 58:44.957
My sister shouldn't know of this.
- Okay.

58:45.458 --> 58:47.874
Stop all cars outside the gate!

58:47.875 --> 58:49.332
Let's go.
- Okay, sir.

58:57.375 --> 58:59.249
Where the hell was the security?

59:00.083 --> 59:01.790
What about the police?

59:02.375 --> 59:04.499
lt's a single bullet in the throat.

59:04.500 --> 59:06.790
He's very critical.
Has lost a lot of blood.

59:06.791 --> 59:08.499
We're trying to stop it.

59:10.708 --> 59:12.332
Where is the hospital security?

59:12.541 --> 59:14.207
l have no idea, sir.

59:15.125 --> 59:17.665
- Doctor!
- Call the police chief!

59:20.750 --> 59:24.040
You guys, secure this
area from all sides.

59:24.500 --> 59:26.749
Get more people.

59:27.208 --> 59:28.624
Move it!

59:30.000 --> 59:32.707
- What happened?
- He's not answering!

59:32.958 --> 59:34.499
Call his deputy then.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.249
Okay, sir.
- Where the hell is papa's security!

59:43.375 --> 59:45.457
Who sent this son of a bitch!

59:45.875 --> 59:47.415
Check their firearm licenses.

59:48.125 --> 59:50.832
Back from the whorehouse, Sharma?

59:50.833 --> 59:52.749
Man the gates!

59:53.041 --> 59:55.124
We don't need cops here.

59:57.375 --> 01:00:00.332
You heard what l said?

01:00:00.333 --> 01:00:01.624
Out!

01:00:02.583 --> 01:00:05.124
Let the police do it's job,
Mr. Prithviraj..

01:00:05.833 --> 01:00:07.332
or else..
- Or else?

01:00:08.041 --> 01:00:10.499
What will you do?

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:12.540
Why have you come now anyway?

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:15.832
Arrest the bastard!

01:00:16.291 --> 01:00:17.624
Drag him away!

01:00:17.625 --> 01:00:20.499
Arrest me, will you?

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:22.249
You bloody pimp!

01:00:23.041 --> 01:00:25.082
You scoundrel!

01:00:25.083 --> 01:00:27.124
Let go! l'll chop you into pieces.

01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:30.499
You dare to arrest me, you beggar!

01:00:31.541 --> 01:00:32.790
What are you doing?

01:00:32.791 --> 01:00:35.165
Now do you remember your duty?

01:00:35.166 --> 01:00:37.749
Sir, you can't do this! - B negative

01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:41.624

Sir, you cannot do this!

01:00:44.708 --> 01:00:45.915
Back off!

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.582
l can do anything.

01:00:49.583 --> 01:00:50.790
Arrest him too!

01:00:50.791 --> 01:00:51.999
You will pay for this! !
You hit my brother!

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.582
l'll chop you into pieces.

01:00:53.583 --> 01:00:57.040
Get up!
- SP Sharma!

01:00:57.041 --> 01:00:59.790
Apologise to him.
- You're dead!

01:00:59.791 --> 01:01:01.124
l'll kill you.

01:01:01.125 --> 01:01:02.290
Sorry.

01:01:02.541 --> 01:01:04.207
Hey, you!

01:01:12.958 --> 01:01:14.290
Detractors.

01:01:15.291 --> 01:01:16.582
Scissors, fast.

01:01:18.666 --> 01:01:20.040
Pass the forceps.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.332
Please bring me a glass of water.

01:01:33.666 --> 01:01:35.124
Heart rate?

01:01:42.875 --> 01:01:44.999
Pass the mop.. mop.

01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:47.957
Scissors..

01:02:22.041 --> 01:02:23.915
Chandu..

01:02:24.166 --> 01:02:27.040
l've asked for a CBl inquiry.

01:02:28.083 --> 01:02:30.165
The culprit won't get away!

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.332
Given these circumstances,
l'll have to take charge of the party.

01:02:38.833 --> 01:02:40.040
Father..

01:02:42.333 --> 01:02:43.707
l need your approval.

01:02:43.708 --> 01:02:55.415
Down with police autocracy!

01:02:55.416 --> 01:03:00.249
Free Prithvi!

01:03:00.250 --> 01:03:03.332
lf the killer isn't caught,
we'll burn the city down!

01:03:03.333 --> 01:03:05.582
Our people are on the job too.

01:03:06.375 --> 01:03:07.582
How is mom?

01:03:09.250 --> 01:03:12.040
She's putting up a brave front,
but from within she..

01:03:12.041 --> 01:03:14.040
SP Sharma himself filed the report.

01:03:14.041 --> 01:03:16.290
He's charged you under
sections 353, 337 and 307.

01:03:16.291 --> 01:03:17.499
But you'll get bail.

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:19.499
l've stated in my report..

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:21.540
Mr. Prithvi had no weapons.

01:03:21.541 --> 01:03:23.624
That's my only regret.

01:03:23.958 --> 01:03:26.415
- lf l had a gun l would've..
- Prithvi!

01:03:28.333 --> 01:03:29.582
Uncle.

01:03:30.458 --> 01:03:32.499
No one touches SP Sharma.

01:03:33.083 --> 01:03:34.790
l'll deal with him myself.

01:04:34.541 --> 01:04:37.415
You've made all my dreams
come true, friend.

01:04:41.875 --> 01:04:43.374
You changed the poster!

01:04:43.375 --> 01:04:45.207
l'm screwed, sir.

01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:49.332
Now, they believe l was involved
even in your uncle's murder.

01:04:52.125 --> 01:04:53.749
lf he gets bail..

01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:56.124
he'll kill me.

01:04:56.666 --> 01:04:59.082
You didn't charge him appropriately.

01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:02.957
You should've used
sections 376 and 341.

01:05:03.458 --> 01:05:05.165
He would've been in your custody.

01:05:05.166 --> 01:05:06.707
Section 376?

01:05:07.333 --> 01:05:09.207
- That's a rape charge.
- Correct.

01:05:14.416 --> 01:05:15.874
So tell me..

01:05:17.541 --> 01:05:20.540
where should we
lodge the rape complaint?

01:05:21.041 --> 01:05:22.207
lsn't she..

01:05:22.208 --> 01:05:26.124
A totally genuine case, SP.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.749
Prithvi promised to
make her a candidate..

01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:31.749
and for three years he
sexually exploited her.

01:05:32.666 --> 01:05:34.332
lt's a serious charge.

01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:37.082
What if she backs out?

01:05:37.458 --> 01:05:38.749
Sir..

01:05:39.916 --> 01:05:41.915
l've been through hell.

01:05:44.041 --> 01:05:46.165
Finally, l'm in safe hands now.

01:05:48.833 --> 01:05:50.707
l will get an election ticket here.

01:05:51.833 --> 01:05:53.957
There's no question of backing out.

01:05:57.166 --> 01:06:00.040
- there seems to be No end to the
misery of the Rashtrawadi Party.

01:06:00.041 --> 01:06:01.540
ln a sensational twist..

01:06:01.541 --> 01:06:03.665
Prithviraj, who has already
been charged for assaulting..

01:06:03.666 --> 01:06:05.290
..a police officer,

01:06:05.291 --> 01:06:08.457
has now been accused of
raping a party worker.

01:06:08.458 --> 01:06:14.749
Denied bail, he's been remanded
to police custody for 15 days.

01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:18.957
l deny every charge
levelled against Prithvi.

01:06:20.041 --> 01:06:22.624
We shall approach the
high court for his bail.

01:06:24.291 --> 01:06:27.999
Our supreme leader, Bhanu Pratap
is still fighting for his life.

01:06:29.083 --> 01:06:30.957
First Chandra Pratap, and now this.

01:06:31.541 --> 01:06:33.624
- We Are being attacked repeatedly.

01:06:34.250 --> 01:06:35.999
- And on the pretext of
investigating, the inept..

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.374
..government ls doing nothing.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.499
- But the people demand answers.

01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:41.624
- Victory to Rashtrawadi!

01:06:41.625 --> 01:06:43.999
- Victory to Veerendra Pratap!

01:06:53.166 --> 01:06:55.874
You want me to sign this?
Have you lost it?

01:06:59.666 --> 01:07:01.832
- You don't have a choice.
- Okay.

01:07:02.541 --> 01:07:04.332
Go home and take care of mom.

01:07:04.333 --> 01:07:06.332
l can deal with these people.

01:07:06.333 --> 01:07:08.749
But that's only if you get out.

01:07:10.291 --> 01:07:12.665
Your bail application was denied.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.540
Since it is a rape charge..

01:07:14.541 --> 01:07:16.790
women's organisations and
the media are up in arms.

01:07:16.791 --> 01:07:18.999
But, how will signing this help?

01:07:23.916 --> 01:07:25.665
Leave that to me, brother.

01:07:27.166 --> 01:07:28.415
Trust me.

01:07:28.666 --> 01:07:30.249
l'll get you out of here.

01:07:44.666 --> 01:07:47.499
They'll pay for this heavily.
Everyone of them!

01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:07.915
l've made a big mistake, Sir.

01:08:08.125 --> 01:08:09.749
Am appealing to your kindness.

01:08:10.125 --> 01:08:11.415
l am younger than you..

01:08:12.166 --> 01:08:14.040
so deserve forgiveness.

01:08:18.125 --> 01:08:19.332
Sorry.

01:08:21.582 --> 01:08:22.957
Hey Sharma!

01:08:24.625 --> 01:08:25.999
Have you gone mad?

01:08:26.250 --> 01:08:28.624
That's my brother, my uncle.

01:08:29.750 --> 01:08:31.082
Come, Uncle Brij.

01:08:33.625 --> 01:08:36.082
l don't why all this is happening.

01:08:36.750 --> 01:08:39.290
Looks like someone
cast an evil eye on us.

01:08:41.332 --> 01:08:43.749
l'm sorry that you're
having to face this.

01:08:45.957 --> 01:08:47.707
But don't you worry.

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:50.582
l will take care of everything.

01:08:52.291 --> 01:08:53.457
The party..

01:08:53.957 --> 01:08:55.415
as well as the family.

01:09:00.082 --> 01:09:02.415
That's Sooraj.. he's like family.

01:09:05.125 --> 01:09:07.790
How is Aunt? Please sit.

01:09:07.791 --> 01:09:09.582
l'm taking mom to New York.

01:09:09.582 --> 01:09:12.457
The right decision. Absolutely!

01:09:12.791 --> 01:09:14.415
Don't worry about Prithvi.

01:09:14.416 --> 01:09:16.124
l'll move heaven and
earth to get him bail.

01:09:16.125 --> 01:09:18.374
Without him this election.. - My
brother won't contest the election.

01:09:21.416 --> 01:09:23.207
l'm taking him along too.

01:09:28.875 --> 01:09:31.040
He's resigned from the party post.

01:09:33.041 --> 01:09:34.749
He won't return from New York.

01:09:45.375 --> 01:09:48.540
- You mean.. he's never coming back?
- Never!

01:09:50.457 --> 01:09:52.540
The party is all yours.

01:09:53.207 --> 01:09:54.540
Just one condition.

01:09:58.333 --> 01:10:00.707
All charges against
him should be dropped.

01:10:08.166 --> 01:10:09.457
Can be done.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.082
l'll manage the
investigation report.

01:10:18.375 --> 01:10:19.665
One more thing.

01:10:23.416 --> 01:10:25.457
After three days is
his court hearing.

01:10:27.791 --> 01:10:30.040
Until then, if he..

01:10:32.291 --> 01:10:34.415
or any member of my family..

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.957
is hurt in a mishap, of any kind..

01:10:41.416 --> 01:10:43.124
l'll call this deal off.

01:10:45.833 --> 01:10:47.540
Nothing of that sort will happen.

01:11:18.583 --> 01:11:20.832
Martyr's day, indeed!

01:11:22.666 --> 01:11:24.499
What a farce!

01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:59.249
Master..

01:12:15.166 --> 01:12:16.915
All this pomp.. decorations..

01:12:16.916 --> 01:12:18.540
huge photographs..

01:12:18.541 --> 01:12:20.249
What was the need for all this?

01:12:20.250 --> 01:12:21.499
Oh?

01:12:22.166 --> 01:12:23.624
Bothering you, is it?

01:12:24.250 --> 01:12:26.290
lf you wish,
we can put up yours too.

01:12:26.291 --> 01:12:29.749
Seems the cops didn't
look after you well enough.

01:12:31.166 --> 01:12:33.874
Brother, please.. not now.

01:12:38.833 --> 01:12:41.290
Enough of this circus, Samar.

01:12:42.958 --> 01:12:44.915
Your boat has capsized.

01:12:46.333 --> 01:12:49.249
Time to exit the scene now..
for your own good.

01:12:53.375 --> 01:12:55.999
What is good for us,
and what isn't..

01:12:56.916 --> 01:12:58.790
will be our decision now, Veeru.

01:12:59.375 --> 01:13:01.499
And as soon as you step out..

01:13:03.958 --> 01:13:05.957
you'll know the
public's decision too.

01:13:08.666 --> 01:13:09.915
Come on.

01:13:11.125 --> 01:13:12.415
Leave.

01:13:13.333 --> 01:13:33.957
- Chandra Pratap!
- you are immortal..

01:13:34.166 --> 01:13:36.665
Orchestrate as many
slogans as you wish!

01:13:37.625 --> 01:13:38.999
After the funeral..

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.999
a long and dark exile awaits you!

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.499
They aren't going anywhere.

01:13:44.791 --> 01:13:47.207
They never intended to.

01:13:47.458 --> 01:13:48.749
So Samar..?

01:13:50.041 --> 01:13:52.249
Trusting him was a big mistake.

01:13:52.250 --> 01:13:53.957
l can't..

01:13:54.125 --> 01:13:57.040
accept this.

01:13:57.333 --> 01:14:00.749
Father, you have to
expel Prithvi from the party.

01:14:01.166 --> 01:14:02.665
He's a traitor.

01:14:03.125 --> 01:14:05.082
He'll destroy the party from within.

01:14:05.583 --> 01:14:07.749
Do this for your son.

01:14:07.750 --> 01:14:09.707
lf l expel Prithvi..

01:14:10.750 --> 01:14:13.332
it will trigger a..

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:20.665
wave of public sympathy..

01:14:21.833 --> 01:14:24.165
for him.

01:14:24.375 --> 01:14:27.457
But father, tolerating him
is just impossible for me!

01:14:28.125 --> 01:14:30.540
Both father and son
treated me like dirt.

01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:34.332
l hate that man.

01:14:34.333 --> 01:14:35.749
Son..

01:14:36.958 --> 01:14:39.957
this is politics.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.957
Here, keep your enemies..

01:14:45.250 --> 01:14:48.582
close to you.

01:14:49.708 --> 01:14:51.749
The real enemy isn't Prithvi.

01:14:53.791 --> 01:14:54.957
lt's Samar!

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.499
This was expected.

01:14:59.166 --> 01:15:01.707
Bhanu Pratap is a past
master of this game.

01:15:03.083 --> 01:15:04.832
He knows that
accepting the resignation..

01:15:04.833 --> 01:15:06.624
would've made Prithvi a martyr.

01:15:08.458 --> 01:15:09.790
Have you seen this?

01:15:10.916 --> 01:15:12.874
Veerendra has organized a
mammoth rally in Madhopur.

01:15:13.625 --> 01:15:16.415
He'll announce his Chief
Ministerial nomination.

01:15:17.166 --> 01:15:18.624
Hello, sir.

01:15:18.625 --> 01:15:19.915
The iron is hot.

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:47.165
- Here at the
Rashtrawadi Party's rally, where..

01:15:47.166 --> 01:15:49.207
- even as Veerendra
Pratap's helicopter landed..

01:15:49.208 --> 01:15:52.624
- on the other side,
Prithvi Pratap, Samar Pratap..

01:15:52.625 --> 01:15:55.082
..and Brij Gopal's
convoy reached the stage.

01:15:56.333 --> 01:15:58.749
- the crowd ls confused even as..

01:15:58.916 --> 01:16:02.207
- the tableau on the
stage becomes more dramatic.

01:16:03.458 --> 01:16:07.999
- From the Kothra ground, Madhopur,
this ls Malti Joshi, Star News.

01:16:08.250 --> 01:16:10.749
Please use the sofas down there.

01:16:10.750 --> 01:16:12.749
Today, only family
members on the stage.

01:16:12.750 --> 01:16:14.040
Please do cooperate..

01:16:22.458 --> 01:16:25.874
This is too much.
l'll show them their status today.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:30.707
Brother Veeru, don't act in haste.

01:16:33.041 --> 01:16:34.290
But Sooraj, they..

01:16:34.291 --> 01:16:36.790
You know you can end
their political career.

01:16:36.791 --> 01:16:39.624
You come this way. Come on.

01:16:40.208 --> 01:16:42.332
What's the meaning of
this outrage, Uncle?

01:16:42.333 --> 01:16:45.582
ln politics, it's called
hijack in broad daylight.

01:16:45.583 --> 01:16:47.290
What do you mean?
- Take care of yourselves.

01:16:47.291 --> 01:16:51.582
Long live Prithvi Pratap!

01:16:51.583 --> 01:16:54.124
Long live!
- Prithvi!

01:16:55.291 --> 01:16:56.707
My name is..

01:16:57.666 --> 01:16:59.082
Samar Pratap.

01:17:00.250 --> 01:17:01.957
l'm the youngest..

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.582
and l humbly greet you all.

01:17:07.333 --> 01:17:09.415
You've resigned from
the party, Prithvi!

01:17:09.416 --> 01:17:10.749
How will you fight now?

01:17:11.291 --> 01:17:13.457
Throw it in the dustbin, Veerendra.

01:17:13.791 --> 01:17:15.790
lf you have the guts,
throw me out in front of them.

01:17:16.541 --> 01:17:18.540
- Your wish will come true, Prithvi.

01:17:18.541 --> 01:17:21.290
l've always been kept
away from politics..

01:17:21.291 --> 01:17:25.540
and nor am l here to
talk politics today.

01:17:25.541 --> 01:17:27.499
l only want to know one thing:

01:17:27.958 --> 01:17:32.290
My father, Chandra Pratap
gave his life for you..

01:17:32.291 --> 01:17:35.582
at his elder brother's command.

01:17:35.916 --> 01:17:37.999
Does that martyrdom hold
any value for you? Or not?

01:17:41.541 --> 01:17:46.374
l only want to know one thing:
While his father lay dying..

01:17:47.166 --> 01:17:54.165
the police falsely accused Prithvi
and physically dragged him away.

01:17:54.166 --> 01:17:56.124
Does his struggle
mean nothing to you?

01:17:56.125 --> 01:18:02.665
- Prithvi, please fight on..
We are with you!

01:18:02.666 --> 01:18:05.624
There is no court higher
than the people's court.

01:18:05.625 --> 01:18:07.457
And the people of Madhopur..

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.749
have always done justice!

01:18:12.375 --> 01:18:14.290
This is the hour
of destiny, friends!

01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:16.665
ln these trying times..

01:18:17.125 --> 01:18:20.082
Rashtrawadi party needs
a strong and able leader.

01:18:20.625 --> 01:18:23.707
Someone who cares about the poor..

01:18:24.958 --> 01:18:26.665
who fights for their dignity..

01:18:27.083 --> 01:18:30.374
and who will not hesitate to
sacrifice his life for them!

01:18:34.208 --> 01:18:36.540
And you know very well who that is.

01:18:38.708 --> 01:18:42.457
And to strengthen his resolve..

01:18:42.458 --> 01:18:44.332
we have with us..

01:18:44.333 --> 01:18:46.290
our brother, Veerendra Pratap..

01:18:46.291 --> 01:18:48.124
Dalit leader, Sooraj Kumar..

01:18:48.125 --> 01:18:50.790
and our beloved, Brij Gopal.

01:18:51.291 --> 01:18:55.415
Elders, brothers, sisters, friends..

01:18:55.416 --> 01:18:57.124
that leader is your very own..

01:18:57.125 --> 01:19:09.915
Prithvi Pratap!

01:19:10.166 --> 01:19:15.749
- Victory to Prithvi Pratap!
Long live Rashtrawadi Party!

01:19:16.125 --> 01:19:18.040
To preserve..

01:19:18.625 --> 01:19:22.415
the integrity of the party..

01:19:23.666 --> 01:19:28.582
l am pained to declare..

01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:32.207
that Prithvi Pratap..

01:19:33.458 --> 01:19:37.499
is hereby..

01:19:38.791 --> 01:19:40.957
dismissed..

01:19:42.375 --> 01:19:46.499
from the Rashtrawadi Party.

01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:49.624
Sir, please..
answer to our question.

01:19:53.916 --> 01:19:57.040
lt went exactly the
way you had planned.

01:19:59.583 --> 01:20:10.000
Long live!
- Prithvi!

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.749
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!
Long live!
- Prithvi!

01:20:13.749 --> 01:20:13.750
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:17.499
By dismissing me from my own party,
they believe that..
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:17.499 --> 01:20:18.625
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:18.625 --> 01:20:21.040
l have become homeless and orphaned.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:21.458
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:21.458 --> 01:20:22.000
They're under a huge illusion.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.915
They're under a huge illusion.

01:20:24.625 --> 01:20:27.415
Even if they expel
me from the party..

01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:30.290
how can they remove
me from your hearts!

01:20:33.375 --> 01:20:35.874
My home is in your hearts..

01:20:36.166 --> 01:20:37.707
and l'm not leaving that!

01:20:37.708 --> 01:20:50.790
Long live!
- Prithvi!

01:20:50.791 --> 01:20:54.874
lt was as if the entire town
had turned up for my meeting!

01:20:55.250 --> 01:20:56.332
The people are with us.

01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:59.499
The caste-wise
combination of every constituency..

01:20:59.833 --> 01:21:01.249
the local issues..

01:21:01.250 --> 01:21:02.832
the candidates' election history..

01:21:02.833 --> 01:21:04.290
it's all here.

01:21:04.708 --> 01:21:08.290
The list of the top three
candidates from every constituency.

01:21:09.208 --> 01:21:10.707
Samar, we have only nine days..

01:21:10.708 --> 01:21:11.915
to file nominations..

01:21:11.916 --> 01:21:13.915
and our party doesn't
even have a name yet.

01:21:13.916 --> 01:21:15.124
l know, brother.

01:21:15.416 --> 01:21:17.999
Remember, you had formed
an organisation in college?

01:21:18.250 --> 01:21:20.249
Prabhu.
- Right away.

01:21:28.291 --> 01:21:30.124
That's the name of your party.

01:21:30.958 --> 01:21:32.457
You're a youth symbol..

01:21:32.458 --> 01:21:33.749
and that will be your appeal.

01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:35.874
We respect you a lot.

01:21:36.041 --> 01:21:39.665
But you are well aware that our
community has always suffered.

01:21:39.666 --> 01:21:41.249
l know that, Arif.

01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:43.999
But times have changed.

01:21:44.583 --> 01:21:46.374
You can definitely trust us.

01:21:46.541 --> 01:21:49.040
We do trust you, Brij sir but..

01:21:49.333 --> 01:21:52.457
you know that these
political issues are very delicate.

01:21:52.458 --> 01:21:54.624
We won't change our loyalty.

01:21:58.125 --> 01:21:59.790
l can understand.

01:22:00.458 --> 01:22:03.332
We shall pray for you.
- Thank you.

01:22:09.833 --> 01:22:11.832
Uncle their support is crucial.

01:22:12.958 --> 01:22:17.915
33% of the voters in the 132
constituencies are Muslims.

01:22:17.916 --> 01:22:21.790
They vote in a group and
we can't bribe their vote.

01:22:22.166 --> 01:22:24.082
Well then.. we'll need to
strengthen our position.

01:22:24.083 --> 01:22:27.249
And as that happens,
the Muslims will support us.

01:22:27.250 --> 01:22:29.415
Uncle, we also need to
gain the support of..

01:22:29.416 --> 01:22:30.665
..the small regional parties.

01:22:30.666 --> 01:22:34.082
Talks are underway, but they
are asking for a huge price.

01:22:34.958 --> 01:22:36.249
Take it.

01:22:37.083 --> 01:22:38.999
Here is the confirmation.

01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:40.790
What's this?

01:22:40.791 --> 01:22:43.624
We have removed
Prithvi's name from..

01:22:44.083 --> 01:22:46.624
every single bank
account of the party.

01:22:47.333 --> 01:22:50.790
Great! Let him thrash
about for every penny.

01:22:50.791 --> 01:22:53.457
Babulal, the businessmen?

01:22:53.458 --> 01:22:55.165
l've instructed all of them.

01:22:55.541 --> 01:22:58.082
Let him fight the
election as a beggar!

01:22:58.541 --> 01:23:05.915
Long live!
- Prithvi!

01:23:16.166 --> 01:23:18.415
We need a crowd of 300,000.

01:23:18.416 --> 01:23:21.040
You're asking for thousands,
but offering peanuts for that.

01:23:21.041 --> 01:23:23.040
l'll.. make sure
you get the balance.

01:23:23.041 --> 01:23:27.249
My dear sir, to organise crowds,
one needs advance cash. Not credit.

01:23:27.250 --> 01:23:29.249
Don't waste my time.

01:23:29.250 --> 01:23:30.457
l'll.. get it done.

01:23:30.458 --> 01:23:33.040
You've always supported us.

01:23:33.833 --> 01:23:37.332
We've already given
to the party fund.

01:23:37.333 --> 01:23:39.207
That party doesn't exist.

01:23:39.208 --> 01:23:41.957
l'm talking about Prithvi Pratap.

01:23:42.458 --> 01:23:44.457
After all, he will be
your next Chief Minister.

01:23:44.791 --> 01:23:46.832
May your words come true!

01:23:46.833 --> 01:23:48.915
We're always there for you.

01:23:49.416 --> 01:23:51.540
But times are tough.

01:23:51.791 --> 01:23:52.999
Now, that you've come personally..

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.124
please accept this offering.

01:24:06.250 --> 01:24:09.290
Looks like a couple of
zeros have been missed out.

01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:13.290
l brought receipts for 50 million..

01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:16.415
while you are
offering half a million.

01:24:17.916 --> 01:24:20.207
l respect your status.

01:24:20.208 --> 01:24:22.207
Hence, l can't accept this.

01:24:22.583 --> 01:24:25.124
l'm leaving the
receipts here, though.

01:24:25.625 --> 01:24:27.207
Thank you.

01:24:27.208 --> 01:24:30.874
- Looks like, we've suddenly
become political outcasts.

01:24:33.291 --> 01:24:36.999
l've spoken with Sakseria.
l'm going to see him.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:41.249
l don't think in these
conditions he'll bet on Prithvi.

01:24:41.791 --> 01:24:45.540
- Your father had done a
lot for him. Let's see.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:47.999
- l'll visit your
father today itself.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.749
Don't hesitate to call
for absolutely anything.

01:24:50.750 --> 01:24:52.957
For now, only what l've asked for.

01:24:52.958 --> 01:24:55.832
- Of course! 500 million
will reach you by this evening.

01:24:55.833 --> 01:24:57.957
Don't worry.
- l shall leave now.

01:24:59.583 --> 01:25:01.999
Mr. Brij Gopal!
- Hello.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:05.290
Please, come in.
- No.. just came to say hello.

01:25:05.750 --> 01:25:08.290
How is lndu?

01:25:08.291 --> 01:25:10.624
She's well.. very well.

01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:13.207
Okay then..

01:25:49.958 --> 01:25:51.290
Fuck!

01:25:56.833 --> 01:25:59.415
Mr. Samar is in the office.
Should l inform him?

01:26:01.583 --> 01:26:03.207
l'm here to meet Aunty.

01:26:10.583 --> 01:26:12.624
Why don't you get married to Samar?

01:26:12.625 --> 01:26:15.624
Then you can be with me, always.

01:26:15.875 --> 01:26:18.957
l don't need to
marry anyone for that.

01:26:20.375 --> 01:26:22.582
Samar, have you fought with lndu?

01:26:24.083 --> 01:26:27.624
lt's nothing. l'm fine.

01:26:29.166 --> 01:26:30.790
May l say something?

01:26:31.875 --> 01:26:32.957
What?

01:26:33.750 --> 01:26:35.290
l've been a fool, lndu.

01:26:37.625 --> 01:26:39.249
What are you trying to say?

01:26:40.833 --> 01:26:41.999
Just this..

01:26:43.583 --> 01:26:47.165
that not only does my mother,
but even l like you.

01:26:50.416 --> 01:26:51.957
You're lying!

01:26:52.166 --> 01:26:53.540
No!

01:26:57.375 --> 01:26:58.999
l didn't know then.

01:26:59.666 --> 01:27:00.999
l was confused.

01:27:02.083 --> 01:27:03.540
l'm sorry.

01:27:09.166 --> 01:27:10.832
Mom, l accept.

01:27:11.666 --> 01:27:13.790
Please speak with her dad.

01:27:16.458 --> 01:27:17.582
See..

01:27:18.416 --> 01:27:20.457
if this is a joke, l'll hammer you.

01:27:20.458 --> 01:27:21.790
Look at that!

01:27:22.125 --> 01:27:23.707
Threats of violence, already?

01:27:23.708 --> 01:27:26.499
Mom, do ask for an
ambulance as dowry.

01:27:26.916 --> 01:27:28.832
Who knows when l'll have
to go to the hospital.

01:27:45.250 --> 01:27:49.290
"The love is raining.
The color is all over."

01:27:49.291 --> 01:27:51.290
"The anklet is colored,
the drape is colored.

01:27:51.291 --> 01:27:53.332
"l am colored in your love."

01:27:53.333 --> 01:27:57.332
"My heart is swaying."

01:27:57.333 --> 01:28:04.707
"lt keeps swinging."

01:28:04.708 --> 01:28:07.707
"Come to me beloved.
l don't feel good without you."

01:28:19.916 --> 01:28:23.999
"The love is raining."

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.540
"The color is all over."

01:28:44.666 --> 01:28:46.874
Phenomenal response to Prithvi!

01:28:47.083 --> 01:28:50.290
His media management
is excellent, fantastic.

01:28:50.291 --> 01:28:54.915
Your younger son, Samar..

01:28:58.625 --> 01:29:01.249
l'm here to ask something for him.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.374
Anything..

01:29:03.375 --> 01:29:05.082
anything, of course!

01:29:05.083 --> 01:29:06.290
Thank you.

01:29:06.291 --> 01:29:08.165
l'm very fond of lndu.

01:29:09.125 --> 01:29:11.332
And l'm sure,
she'll keep Samar happy.

01:29:11.333 --> 01:29:15.332
l've been looking
forward to this day.

01:29:15.625 --> 01:29:17.290
And you know what..

01:29:17.291 --> 01:29:19.707
Samar will make an
excellent Chief Minister.

01:29:19.708 --> 01:29:21.957
No, it is Prithvi who'll be the CM.

01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:24.124
Samar is just helping him.

01:29:24.125 --> 01:29:25.957
That's fine too.

01:29:25.958 --> 01:29:27.957
After all, Prithvi is the leader.

01:29:28.291 --> 01:29:30.957
Then, we should let Samar be.

01:29:31.250 --> 01:29:34.290
Let lndu marry Prithvi.

01:29:42.083 --> 01:29:44.165
How can you say that!

01:29:44.375 --> 01:29:45.999
That's impossible.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.665
Moreover, lndu loves Samar.

01:29:48.666 --> 01:29:50.499
You don't worry about lndu.

01:29:50.833 --> 01:29:52.957
My choice will be her choice.

01:29:52.958 --> 01:29:56.999
See, if l am to finance a party,
then obviously l will insist..

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.957
that my daughter should
marry the CM designate.

01:30:00.166 --> 01:30:02.790
And in either case,
she will come to your family.

01:30:11.250 --> 01:30:12.624
Let's go.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.415
Have you gone mad?

01:30:15.416 --> 01:30:17.207
Stop talking nonsense.

01:30:17.208 --> 01:30:19.707
How can you even
imagine that l'll marry lndu!

01:30:19.708 --> 01:30:21.790
Samar is right, Prithvi.

01:30:25.041 --> 01:30:27.124
We don't have a choice.

01:30:27.125 --> 01:30:28.707
Of course we do!

01:30:28.708 --> 01:30:30.290
l've decided.

01:30:31.333 --> 01:30:33.124
Samar will become the CM.

01:30:33.833 --> 01:30:35.582
So what if l don't get
to sit on that chair?

01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:36.999
My brother will!

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.165
Ridiculous.
- Wait a minute.

01:30:39.166 --> 01:30:41.249
You think only you
can make sacrifices?

01:30:41.458 --> 01:30:43.290
And l can't?

01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:47.332
l don't care for a position
that takes your happiness away.

01:30:47.625 --> 01:30:48.832
Brother..

01:30:51.791 --> 01:30:54.665
my happiness lies only
in making you the CM.

01:30:55.333 --> 01:30:57.082
And, you want to know the truth?

01:31:03.583 --> 01:31:05.582
lndu knows that l don't love her.

01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:11.332
Then why did you send the proposal?

01:31:11.625 --> 01:31:12.957
Because of you.

01:31:13.750 --> 01:31:16.415
Only Sakseria can
fund your election.

01:31:16.416 --> 01:31:18.332
To hell with his money!

01:31:19.333 --> 01:31:20.957
You're my younger brother.

01:31:21.916 --> 01:31:25.165
- We'll do it on our own.
- That is no longer an option.

01:31:25.625 --> 01:31:29.499
lf we don't accept his support,
he'll offer it to Veerendra.

01:31:30.166 --> 01:31:32.374
And marry lndu to him.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.874
lndu is a very nice girl.

01:31:41.291 --> 01:31:42.874
She'll learn to love you.

01:31:44.708 --> 01:31:46.207
And l know that..

01:31:48.916 --> 01:31:50.790
you will look after her well.

01:31:57.416 --> 01:31:59.999
How can you do this!

01:32:00.916 --> 01:32:03.707
Am l only a business proposal
for you?

01:32:03.958 --> 01:32:05.540
Just another source of income.

01:32:05.958 --> 01:32:08.165
You're upset now.

01:32:08.166 --> 01:32:09.790
We'll talk about this later.

01:32:13.625 --> 01:32:16.207
Our list..
- Why are you doing this to me?

01:32:17.083 --> 01:32:18.290
Why?

01:32:20.708 --> 01:32:23.540
Come.. let's go to the other room.

01:32:30.250 --> 01:32:31.749
Let me handle this, brother.

01:32:44.416 --> 01:32:47.290
You say you don't love me.. fine!

01:32:47.875 --> 01:32:50.082
Don't want to marry me.. don't!

01:32:50.625 --> 01:32:53.749
But what right do you
have to meddle in my life?

01:32:54.250 --> 01:32:57.415
You're forgetting that it was l
who asked for your hand in marriage.

01:32:57.416 --> 01:32:59.832
So what if my father spoke nonsense?

01:33:01.041 --> 01:33:03.082
l still love you!

01:33:03.291 --> 01:33:05.832
l have forsaken his house..
his wealth..

01:33:06.041 --> 01:33:09.749
l'll go with you
wherever you take me.

01:33:10.333 --> 01:33:12.749
l can't marry anyone else.

01:33:13.666 --> 01:33:15.707
l can't live without you.

01:33:18.708 --> 01:33:20.957
ln these circumstances
l can't marry you.

01:33:22.833 --> 01:33:25.374
Please, Samar.. Don't say that!

01:33:25.666 --> 01:33:27.624
Take back your decision.

01:33:28.541 --> 01:33:31.040
l can't take a chance with
my brother's political career.

01:33:31.041 --> 01:33:32.540
And my life?

01:33:32.916 --> 01:33:35.040
You have no problem destroying it!

01:33:35.041 --> 01:33:37.290
l am not destroying your life, lndu.

01:33:38.708 --> 01:33:40.374
l'm trying to protect it.

01:33:42.291 --> 01:33:45.124
You know that if we
reject Prithvi's proposal..

01:33:45.458 --> 01:33:48.040
your father will marry
you off to Veerendra.

01:33:49.875 --> 01:33:51.832
Please try to understand, lndu.

01:33:52.458 --> 01:33:54.207
Whatever you may think of Prithvi..

01:33:54.750 --> 01:33:56.374
l know he will love you a lot.

01:33:57.458 --> 01:33:58.999
And then mom's here too.

01:33:59.833 --> 01:34:01.665
You will be very happy here.

01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:19.915
This is how it's always been, child.

01:34:23.125 --> 01:34:26.915
We are the ones who're
always expected to compromise.

01:34:59.666 --> 01:35:01.624
Hello. Hello.

01:35:02.416 --> 01:35:05.374
We are indeed
honoured by your presence.

01:35:05.375 --> 01:35:06.790
Come, sir..

01:35:08.875 --> 01:35:11.582
Hello.
- Hello. - God bless you.

01:35:12.875 --> 01:35:15.540
Mr. Sakseria, the super
Chief Minister is here.

01:35:15.833 --> 01:35:18.290
Please do introduce me.
- Hello.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.665
My father has sent this..

01:35:28.291 --> 01:35:29.707
for the bride.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:31.290
Thanks for coming.

01:35:31.708 --> 01:35:33.082
Do you seriously believe..

01:35:34.458 --> 01:35:36.790
that by selling your
brother you can win the election?

01:35:38.708 --> 01:35:40.499
Looks like you're nervous.

01:35:42.666 --> 01:35:45.124
Let Sakseria stake as
much loot as he wants..

01:35:45.875 --> 01:35:48.124
you brother will still fall flat.

01:35:48.583 --> 01:35:50.915
The fear of defeat is
clearly visible on your face.

01:35:51.875 --> 01:35:54.915
Uncle, please look after him.

01:35:56.125 --> 01:35:57.749
Enjoy the evening.

01:35:59.708 --> 01:36:01.540
Overconfident, eh?

01:36:49.666 --> 01:36:51.415
Mr. Sooraj,
an exclusive byte, please.

01:36:51.750 --> 01:36:53.874
What can l say about myself?
Speak to the people.

01:36:53.875 --> 01:36:56.707
Some personal questions, please.

01:36:57.791 --> 01:36:59.165
You must be joking.

01:37:00.166 --> 01:37:03.790
There's nothing worth
hiding in a poor person's life.

01:37:04.416 --> 01:37:05.957
My life is an open book.

01:37:07.833 --> 01:37:11.374
However, l can point you
in an interesting direction.

01:37:11.375 --> 01:37:13.124
What do you mean?

01:37:16.291 --> 01:37:17.415
Thank you, sir.

01:37:18.708 --> 01:37:20.999
Hello. Please be seated.

01:37:24.541 --> 01:37:27.165
Sir, how's your campaign doing?

01:37:27.166 --> 01:37:28.415
Fantastic!

01:37:28.416 --> 01:37:31.749
ln just 7 days, we've confirmed
200 plus candidates.

01:37:32.208 --> 01:37:35.332
And it's obvious that
the people are with us.

01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:39.999
lt seems that your entire campaign
is funded by Rajkumar Sakseria.

01:37:41.125 --> 01:37:44.332
See, ours in a new party.
Whoever has wanted to help..

01:37:44.333 --> 01:37:46.957
How much dowry did
you collect from him?

01:37:47.166 --> 01:37:48.665
Look here..

01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:51.790
let's stick to
election-related questions.

01:37:51.791 --> 01:37:53.415
Well, this question
is on everyone's lips.

01:37:53.416 --> 01:37:57.915
Even though lndu was
openly seeing your brother..

01:37:57.916 --> 01:37:59.207
how come she got married to you?

01:37:59.208 --> 01:38:02.582
This is my personal
and family matter.

01:38:02.583 --> 01:38:03.957
Then, at least tell us..

01:38:03.958 --> 01:38:06.165
about the compromises
you've made in this marriage.

01:38:06.166 --> 01:38:08.374
Are you absolutely sure that..

01:38:08.375 --> 01:38:11.832
while you are busy campaigning..

01:38:11.833 --> 01:38:13.457
your wife isn't with your brother?

01:38:13.458 --> 01:38:15.332
Hey! Shut up!

01:38:15.333 --> 01:38:16.540
Shut up!

01:38:16.541 --> 01:38:18.040
- What's the meaning of this?

01:38:18.041 --> 01:38:21.249
Stop this. Stop this at once!
- What are you doing?

01:38:21.250 --> 01:38:22.790
You asked..

01:38:23.166 --> 01:38:24.999
a very filthy question.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:26.999
You will pay for this! Shut this.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.874
Stop it! Hello.
- Shut this down!

01:38:28.875 --> 01:38:31.665
- Prithvi Pratap had
already been charged with..

01:38:31.666 --> 01:38:34.957
- assaulting a police officer
And of raping a woman party worker.

01:38:34.958 --> 01:38:38.707
- Shut this! Shut this down!

01:38:38.708 --> 01:38:40.999
Sir.. one more thing, please.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:42.249
Mr. Sooraj..

01:38:42.250 --> 01:38:44.832
what do you have to say about
Mr. Prithvi Pratap's recent outburst?

01:38:47.333 --> 01:38:49.082
My sympathies are with him.

01:38:49.458 --> 01:38:51.290
His marriage itself
was a huge compromise.

01:38:51.541 --> 01:38:53.624
Hence, it isn't surprising for
him to lose his mental balance.

01:38:53.958 --> 01:38:56.290
And it's obvious that he can't
cope with the stress of elections.

01:38:56.625 --> 01:38:58.249
He needs to rest.

01:39:35.916 --> 01:39:38.707
This for Samar.
- l.. l'll take this.

01:39:59.416 --> 01:40:01.290
Guess who this is!
- Who?

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.165
You didn't tell me she was coming!

01:40:18.166 --> 01:40:21.957
How could l - she called me
at 3 A.M. from the airport.

01:40:22.125 --> 01:40:23.540
Sarah?

01:40:49.416 --> 01:40:50.624
Look Sarah..

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.249
The two of you look
very nice together.

01:42:00.625 --> 01:42:02.624
She obviously loves you a lot.

01:42:02.875 --> 01:42:04.790
But maybe she doesn't know..

01:42:07.291 --> 01:42:09.457
that you can't love anyone.

01:42:09.708 --> 01:42:12.290
lndu, please listen to me..
- No, you listen to me!

01:42:13.125 --> 01:42:15.540
You only know how to use people.

01:42:17.833 --> 01:42:20.290
l don't even recognise this Samar.

01:42:22.083 --> 01:42:24.624
The darkness that
l see in your heart!

01:42:25.500 --> 01:42:27.832
l'm actually grateful to my father..

01:42:28.416 --> 01:42:30.749
for rejecting your proposal.

01:42:31.833 --> 01:42:34.957
Because whatever
your brother may be..

01:42:37.375 --> 01:42:38.999
he has a pure heart.

01:42:39.708 --> 01:42:41.457
You won't understand this, lndu.

01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:45.582
This much l do understand, Samar.

01:42:46.666 --> 01:42:48.582
That we don't exploit those..

01:42:50.666 --> 01:42:53.040
..who love us.

01:42:58.958 --> 01:43:01.249
Sarah may not be able to bear it.

01:43:08.333 --> 01:43:12.082
The election campaign of the
Rashtravadi party has gone up.

01:43:12.083 --> 01:43:16.124
The campaigning was at its
full flow at the district Beerpur.

01:43:16.125 --> 01:43:21.040
There were huge rallies in
several areas. The new..

01:43:21.041 --> 01:43:23.665
..president of the party Virendra
Pratap and the general secretary..

01:43:23.666 --> 01:43:26.249
..Suraj Kumar delivered
speech too. lf the presence of

01:43:26.250 --> 01:43:28.707
..the voters is taken into
consideration than this campaign..

01:43:28.708 --> 01:43:32.915
..has been thriving. Media
has already made Suraj Kumar..

01:43:32.916 --> 01:43:36.374
..a hero of the backward class.
The pace with which he has..

01:43:36.375 --> 01:43:43.040
..evolved in politics and with his
gift of gab he has already become..

01:43:43.416 --> 01:43:46.915
..a leader amongst the backward
class and would be supported by them.

01:43:46.916 --> 01:43:48.957
There is no cause for worry here.

01:43:49.166 --> 01:43:52.290
Every single person
is rooting for you.

01:43:52.791 --> 01:43:55.540
On the one hand,
you speak of our old alliance..

01:43:56.041 --> 01:43:58.374
and yet, you are being
secretive about seat-sharing.

01:43:58.958 --> 01:44:01.082
What am l supposed to
tell the High Command?

01:44:02.083 --> 01:44:05.457
Bhanu, l'll have to
declare the seats today.

01:44:05.458 --> 01:44:08.915
lf you enjoy defeat,
you can have more seats.

01:44:09.125 --> 01:44:10.249
Veerendra..

01:44:10.625 --> 01:44:12.832
don't forget that mine
is a national party.

01:44:13.541 --> 01:44:15.874
Don't force me to
take drastic decisions.

01:44:15.875 --> 01:44:17.874
Give me a break, grandpa!

01:44:18.625 --> 01:44:21.707
Don't forget that we've been
lugging your national burden.

01:44:21.708 --> 01:44:23.665
The last time you had
just 12 legislators..

01:44:23.666 --> 01:44:25.374
and yet we made you
the Chief Minister.

01:44:26.125 --> 01:44:28.832
So, this time don't expect even six.

01:44:28.833 --> 01:44:30.165
Now you decide.

01:44:30.166 --> 01:44:31.999
Veeru..

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:33.707
make that 10.

01:44:33.708 --> 01:44:35.457
We'll lose all of them.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:37.582
We can't take that chance.

01:44:37.583 --> 01:44:38.874
Bhanu..

01:44:39.416 --> 01:44:41.290
the coalition will break.

01:44:41.791 --> 01:44:43.749
Ask him to release 20 seats.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.165
We'll pay you a total of..

01:44:46.375 --> 01:44:48.082
400 million.

01:44:48.083 --> 01:44:49.582
500!

01:44:53.833 --> 01:44:57.999
- Victory to Rashtrawadi!

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:01.249
Sir, what are the terms of
alliance with Prajatantrik Party?

01:45:01.250 --> 01:45:04.415
Sir, who else is filing
nominations along with you?

01:45:04.416 --> 01:45:06.499
How many seats are they contesting?

01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:08.540
You will get to
know it all very soon.

01:45:09.916 --> 01:45:12.582
Patience.. Patience
is always rewarded.

01:45:15.041 --> 01:45:17.207
Everything is going in their favour.

01:45:17.208 --> 01:45:20.499
lf you don't do something quick,
we'll lose the plot.

01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:23.082
Samar sir, we need a masterstroke.

01:45:28.833 --> 01:45:29.999
Yes, sir?

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.207
l had asked you for
a favour, Babulal.

01:45:32.458 --> 01:45:34.999
Your favour is not so
easy to fulfill, sir.

01:45:35.541 --> 01:45:37.707
And it wouldn't be very
ethical of me, would it?

01:45:37.708 --> 01:45:41.540
True. Sorry, l disturbed you.

01:45:42.208 --> 01:45:44.457
He wasted my time.

01:45:45.625 --> 01:45:48.040
He is speaking of ethics. lmagine!

01:45:48.958 --> 01:45:52.165
Now, what are the
ethics of a bandit? Tell me.

01:46:18.125 --> 01:46:20.124
Hello.. hello?

01:46:20.125 --> 01:46:24.415
Babulal, yesterday you were
giving me a lecture on ethics..

01:46:24.583 --> 01:46:28.332
l was.. l was.. l was
completely out of line, sir..

01:46:28.333 --> 01:46:30.707
l could see that.

01:46:31.541 --> 01:46:34.415
Anyway, tell me where
l should send these photos.

01:46:34.583 --> 01:46:37.624
Please forgive me, sir..

01:46:41.500 --> 01:46:44.832
l..

01:46:46.833 --> 01:46:48.290
very..

01:46:50.041 --> 01:46:53.957
l went astray.. Please forgive me..

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.165
l.. can..

01:46:58.333 --> 01:47:03.040
l beg of you.. Please forgive me.

01:47:04.750 --> 01:47:09.124
Brother Samar..
the time is really bad.

01:47:10.916 --> 01:47:12.915
The man needs some help.

01:47:13.166 --> 01:47:14.665
What's this?

01:47:18.041 --> 01:47:19.874
l was.. helpless..

01:47:24.333 --> 01:47:26.374
You already know this to be true.

01:47:27.500 --> 01:47:29.207
Now, you only have
to state it publicly.

01:47:30.125 --> 01:47:31.582
But.. but..

01:47:31.583 --> 01:47:34.249
Never be afraid of the truth!

01:47:36.250 --> 01:47:39.124
l'm with you. Have no fear.

01:47:39.583 --> 01:47:42.499
No harm will come to you. Come.

01:47:44.666 --> 01:47:46.207
Don't you trust me?

01:47:51.375 --> 01:47:52.957
This way.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.040
Okay ready. Silence, please.

01:47:58.458 --> 01:48:00.707
Allegations and counter-allegations
during elections are..

01:48:00.708 --> 01:48:02.207
..a common occurrence.

01:48:02.208 --> 01:48:06.290
But, what we're about to
reveal now will stun you.

01:48:06.291 --> 01:48:08.124
Today we have with us..

01:48:08.125 --> 01:48:09.915
a staunch loyalist of Rashtrawadi..

01:48:09.916 --> 01:48:11.249
Mr. Babulal.

01:48:21.375 --> 01:48:24.374
Having served the party
faithfully for 25 years..

01:48:26.375 --> 01:48:28.999
it pains me to admit that..

01:48:30.708 --> 01:48:34.790
the Rashtrawadi Party has
become a den of corruption.

01:48:36.166 --> 01:48:38.457
When Mr. Bhanu Pratap was in power..

01:48:39.500 --> 01:48:40.999
his son..

01:48:41.833 --> 01:48:43.707
Veerendra Pratap took..

01:48:44.416 --> 01:48:47.249
fixed kickbacks from
every government contract.

01:48:47.666 --> 01:48:50.457
He raked in billions.

01:48:51.500 --> 01:48:53.665
Even donations meant
for the party fund..

01:48:54.333 --> 01:48:57.874
were not spared.

01:49:03.416 --> 01:49:07.207
Ever since Sooraj Kumar
became general secretary..

01:49:08.875 --> 01:49:15.499
this politics of cash..
has escalated.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.790
- ln these elections..
- Get him here!

01:49:19.791 --> 01:49:21.582
Son of a bitch!

01:49:22.208 --> 01:49:24.040
The men are on their way.

01:49:25.958 --> 01:49:28.624
l'm going to torture
the bastard to death!

01:49:30.375 --> 01:49:32.249
Veeru, please calm down.

01:49:33.375 --> 01:49:35.082
This is Samar's ploy.

01:49:36.333 --> 01:49:38.040
lt's imperative that
Babulal publicly take..

01:49:38.041 --> 01:49:39.249
..back his own statement.

01:49:47.208 --> 01:49:49.707
Don't worry at all, Babulal.

01:49:50.333 --> 01:49:51.749
Have a seat.

01:49:55.333 --> 01:49:57.707
Your safety is my
responsibility now.

01:50:04.458 --> 01:50:06.124
Tell me..

01:50:07.875 --> 01:50:10.957
That night when you called
my father at the airport..

01:50:12.708 --> 01:50:14.749
..who asked you to make that call?

01:50:16.583 --> 01:50:20.707
Wh.. what are you asking?
l.. don't understand..

01:50:22.875 --> 01:50:24.957
Who asked you to call?

01:50:26.166 --> 01:50:27.457
Phone?

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.124
l.. l didn't call.

01:50:31.666 --> 01:50:33.207
Babulal..

01:50:34.458 --> 01:50:36.124
you are one of us.

01:50:37.333 --> 01:50:39.790
l respect you a lot.

01:50:41.416 --> 01:50:43.957
Please.. don't insult me.

01:50:45.375 --> 01:50:47.957
S.. s.. sssir.. l beg of you..

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:50.999
Don't ask me this question.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.124
Who asked you to call my father?

01:50:53.958 --> 01:50:55.290
Veerendra Pratap..

01:50:55.791 --> 01:50:57.165
or Sooraj?

01:51:07.958 --> 01:51:09.582
Sooraj Kumar.

01:51:16.750 --> 01:51:17.957
Thank you.

01:51:19.458 --> 01:51:22.332
You have proved your loyalty.

01:51:23.541 --> 01:51:25.207
You're definitely one of us.

01:51:28.333 --> 01:51:29.749
You..

01:51:34.625 --> 01:51:36.999
l just need your benediction.

01:51:37.875 --> 01:51:38.957
Of course.

01:51:40.291 --> 01:51:41.915
You have my word.

01:51:43.500 --> 01:51:44.874
Here.. your phone.

01:51:46.875 --> 01:51:49.457
l've entered my
personal number into it.

01:51:50.708 --> 01:51:52.832
l'll always be in touch.

01:51:53.625 --> 01:51:56.665
Anytime.

01:52:09.666 --> 01:52:10.999
Sooraj.

01:52:13.083 --> 01:52:14.415
lt was Sooraj.

01:52:29.166 --> 01:52:30.457
Anytime..

01:54:05.875 --> 01:54:09.124
Mr. Babulal's violent
death has sent shock waves..

01:54:09.125 --> 01:54:11.040
..throughout the
state's political circles.

01:54:11.041 --> 01:54:14.457
What is being seen as more
than a mere coincidence is that..

01:54:14.458 --> 01:54:18.124
just this morning he
resigned from Rashtrawadi Party..

01:54:18.125 --> 01:54:20.832
publicly levelling
allegations of corruption..

01:54:20.833 --> 01:54:23.707
..and nepotism against
the party leadership.

01:54:24.333 --> 01:54:27.874
Mr. Babulal was killed in a car
blast on the Chhattarpur road..

01:54:27.875 --> 01:54:29.124
..while he was travelling.

01:54:29.125 --> 01:54:33.249
Both he and his driver died of
severe burn injuries on the spot.

01:54:38.375 --> 01:54:40.707
However, initial evidence suggests..

01:54:40.708 --> 01:54:42.040
..it could have been a
bomb placed in the car.

01:54:53.500 --> 01:54:56.499
- they Are not going to
rule out any possibilities.

01:55:05.083 --> 01:55:06.207
Bye.

01:55:08.208 --> 01:55:09.415
Mr. Veerendra Pratap..

01:55:09.416 --> 01:55:11.957
after Babulal's testimony on TV,
didn't you threaten him? - Rubbish!

01:55:11.958 --> 01:55:14.540
- He was a victim of a deadly
conspiracy. - Who was behind this?

01:55:14.541 --> 01:55:17.540
- He openly accused you of
corruption. So, did you?

01:55:17.541 --> 01:55:18.790
Meaning?

01:55:20.375 --> 01:55:21.790
What the hell do you mean?

01:55:22.916 --> 01:55:24.415
That l got him killed?!

01:55:26.958 --> 01:55:30.415
He was like my family.

01:55:31.375 --> 01:55:33.290
One of the founders of this party.

01:55:34.291 --> 01:55:36.707
Babulal's murder..

01:55:37.625 --> 01:55:39.499
will cost them dearly.

01:55:41.750 --> 01:55:43.207
Very dearly.

01:55:46.375 --> 01:55:48.290
They're scared..

01:55:48.750 --> 01:55:52.999
panic stricken!

01:55:54.333 --> 01:55:59.374
Their singular objective
is to destroy our unity.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:01.832
But, brothers..

01:56:02.708 --> 01:56:06.540
Rashtrawadi's
foundations aren't so weak..

01:56:06.541 --> 01:56:08.790
as to be shaken by such incidents.

01:56:13.916 --> 01:56:16.040
Baseless allegations..

01:56:16.791 --> 01:56:18.999
imaginary scandals.

01:56:19.458 --> 01:56:23.665
They're scrambling around
for dirt to throw at us!

01:56:25.083 --> 01:56:30.499
But, let them know,
that if you spit at the sky..

01:56:31.250 --> 01:56:34.790
it will land back on your own face.

01:56:40.958 --> 01:56:43.290
The repercussions will be severe.

01:56:45.250 --> 01:56:47.957
The repercussions will be severe!

01:56:57.208 --> 01:56:59.124
lnspector Sharma!

01:56:59.125 --> 01:57:01.957
Your vacation's over.
Do something useful now.

01:57:02.333 --> 01:57:03.832
Do something.

01:57:04.791 --> 01:57:06.457
We're petitioning the court to..

01:57:06.458 --> 01:57:10.457
reopen the rape
investigation against Prithvi.

01:57:11.458 --> 01:57:13.915
Mark my words,
he will be behind bars.

01:57:13.916 --> 01:57:15.374
We're also asking the
Election Commission to..

01:57:15.375 --> 01:57:17.999
disqualify him
since he is a criminal.

01:57:19.791 --> 01:57:21.249
That's fine, Veeru.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.457
But, for the election we
only need people's support.

01:57:24.458 --> 01:57:25.957
Which we are assured of anyway.

01:57:26.958 --> 01:57:29.249
- Why not let sleeping dogs lie?
- Sooraj!

01:57:29.958 --> 01:57:32.749
ln politics,
you never let dogs sleep.

01:57:34.166 --> 01:57:36.124
You keep them awake.

01:57:36.583 --> 01:57:38.124
So that when needed..

01:57:38.916 --> 01:57:40.332
they bark!

01:57:40.333 --> 01:57:42.915
Make me talk to Prithvi.
lt's urgent.

01:57:42.916 --> 01:57:46.957
lt's lnspector Bhola Singh.
Says it's urgent.

01:57:50.458 --> 01:57:52.415
Hello?
- Hello, sir.

01:57:52.416 --> 01:57:55.874
The prey is here.
ln the farm house of Mr. Veerendra.

01:57:55.875 --> 01:57:57.999
Security is very tight.
- Okay.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:57:59.749
Tell me what do l do?

01:58:00.125 --> 01:58:02.374
Get your men out of there.
l'm on my way.

01:58:04.333 --> 01:58:06.249
Head to Chhattarpur farms.

01:58:22.166 --> 01:58:23.874
Come on. Get going from here.

01:58:23.875 --> 01:58:28.499
Party president Prithvi Singh
did a road show in Madhavpur.

01:58:28.500 --> 01:58:31.957
There was a great amount of
enthusiasm in people for this.

01:58:31.958 --> 01:58:36.957
Men, women, children and even
senior citizens participated in it.

01:58:37.166 --> 01:58:41.915
First a rally at Ramna Maidan
and now a road show at Madhavpur.

01:58:41.916 --> 01:58:45.332
With this new and youthful
image of Prithvi Singh..

01:58:45.333 --> 01:58:51.040
..he is slowly gaining
popularity amongst young voters.

01:58:51.041 --> 01:58:56.124
When you play hide n seek with me,
it creates magic in my heart..

01:58:57.125 --> 01:58:59.540
Hey, Sharma!
Where were you hiding, huh?

01:58:59.541 --> 01:59:01.790
That was one long vacation!

01:59:02.291 --> 01:59:04.040
l really missed you.

01:59:04.416 --> 01:59:05.874
l.. made a big mistake, sir.

01:59:05.875 --> 01:59:07.957
Your slap packs a solid punch, pal.

01:59:08.500 --> 01:59:09.832
lt does!

01:59:10.250 --> 01:59:11.707
Why don't you give me a sample?

01:59:12.250 --> 01:59:14.082
lt was a big mistake.

01:59:14.833 --> 01:59:17.915
l did apologize.. to Brij Gopal.

01:59:26.500 --> 01:59:29.874
So? Lovely, wasn't it?

01:59:32.916 --> 01:59:34.790
You did absolutely right.

01:59:35.750 --> 01:59:37.582
l deserved it!

01:59:38.833 --> 01:59:41.124
But, now l'll be good.

01:59:43.208 --> 01:59:45.790
See, l'm the one
who made that woman..

01:59:45.791 --> 01:59:48.207
withdraw her complaint against you.

01:59:48.208 --> 01:59:51.249
Ah, that woman..

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:53.749
Glad that you reminded me of her.

01:59:53.750 --> 01:59:55.499
l've to settle her account too.

01:59:55.500 --> 02:00:00.582
l.. l'll bring her to you,
whenever you want.

02:00:00.583 --> 02:00:03.582
Good. Call her now.

02:00:14.500 --> 02:00:17.999
Mr. Sharma! What's up?

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:19.790
l'm here with the boss.

02:00:20.375 --> 02:00:22.290
He wants to meet you.

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.999
- Where Are you?- been shopping at the new market.

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:27.957
Huh? New market?

02:00:34.875 --> 02:00:37.457
Call Nathu and Ballu.

02:00:38.291 --> 02:00:40.457
They should be there.
- Wait right there.

02:00:40.458 --> 02:00:42.082

02:00:42.750 --> 02:00:44.207
- Vee.. Veerendra's

02:00:44.208 --> 02:00:45.957
Yeah, sure.

02:00:52.958 --> 02:00:56.374
Ah, l just love this one!
- This silk is from Benaras.

02:00:56.375 --> 02:00:59.915
Made by hand..
- all hand-crafted.

02:01:10.125 --> 02:01:14.249
Hey.. hey.. Let go! Let go of me.

02:01:14.250 --> 02:01:17.457
Come on, sit in the car.
- Let go off me!

02:01:17.458 --> 02:01:20.665
Come on, sit inside. Don't shout!
- Let go off me!

02:01:20.666 --> 02:01:22.290
Let go off me!

02:01:22.291 --> 02:01:26.207

02:01:30.291 --> 02:01:32.832
- Tell me..
- Sir, our men Are here.

02:01:33.250 --> 02:01:34.624
Who all?

02:01:34.625 --> 02:01:37.332
l recognized Ballu.
He moves with Prithvi.

02:01:38.375 --> 02:01:40.040
Let go! To the new market.

02:01:40.041 --> 02:01:43.957
Help me! Help!

02:01:53.750 --> 02:01:55.999
What's everybody doing?

02:02:00.125 --> 02:02:01.415
Yes, Samar..

02:02:01.416 --> 02:02:03.290
Have you gone crazy, brother?

02:02:03.291 --> 02:02:06.040
Now that everything's going well,
don't do anything stupid.

02:02:06.458 --> 02:02:08.124
lt's done.

02:02:09.708 --> 02:02:10.915
Finished!

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:13.540
You should've seen his face.

02:02:13.541 --> 02:02:15.124
Brother, please listen to me.

02:02:15.125 --> 02:02:19.040
Leave me.. leave me!

02:02:19.041 --> 02:02:20.999
Just a sec..

l'll call you later.

02:02:24.125 --> 02:02:25.999
Please get out of there, fast!

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:27.290
l'm sending some guys to clean up.

02:02:27.291 --> 02:02:29.790
Let me go..

02:02:30.916 --> 02:02:32.207
Hey..

Please, let me go.

02:02:39.333 --> 02:02:42.040
How are you, sweetheart?

02:02:43.708 --> 02:02:46.457
Now, tell me.. Where do you
want to contest from? Huh?

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:48.832
From Sitapur?

02:02:48.833 --> 02:02:50.415
Or from hell?

02:02:56.083 --> 02:02:57.415
Somebody call the police!

02:02:57.416 --> 02:03:00.165
Sarah.. please..

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:05.790
Sir, listen to us..

02:03:09.250 --> 02:03:13.499
Ma'am, one minute please.
Ma'am, did you see the kidnaper?

02:03:13.666 --> 02:03:14.999
Move back! Move back all of you.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:18.124
We have freedom of the press.
She will have to talk.

02:03:18.541 --> 02:03:19.915
You're right.

02:03:19.916 --> 02:03:21.457
The media is free.

02:03:21.750 --> 02:03:23.040
But remember..

02:03:23.833 --> 02:03:26.040
..your freedom cannot
be used to terrorise us.

02:04:12.416 --> 02:04:13.582
Come on.

02:04:22.916 --> 02:04:26.165
- Sir, this is lnspector Singh.
SP Sharma was killed around 4 PM.

02:04:26.375 --> 02:04:27.999
- We've found drugs on his body.

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:29.790
- Clean lt up.
- Okay.

02:04:29.791 --> 02:04:31.124
- l'll inform Veeru about this.

02:04:31.125 --> 02:04:32.332
No!

02:04:33.041 --> 02:04:35.915
Don't bother. l'll tell him myself.

02:04:35.916 --> 02:04:37.165
Okay.

02:04:50.750 --> 02:04:52.082
Jeez, Sarah..

02:06:27.500 --> 02:06:28.707
Sarah..

02:08:30.291 --> 02:08:31.707
Sensational news!

02:08:31.708 --> 02:08:34.499
lt is unprecedented in the
country's election history..

02:08:34.666 --> 02:08:38.415
that so many nominations of one
party have been rejected altogether.

02:08:38.416 --> 02:08:41.290
The Election Commission has
said that the nominations..

02:08:41.291 --> 02:08:43.040
..were incorrectly filed.

02:08:43.041 --> 02:08:45.874
The papers were
correctly filed, Veeru.

02:08:46.208 --> 02:08:48.499
Yes, everything was in order.

02:08:48.500 --> 02:08:50.457
ln order, my foot!

02:08:52.375 --> 02:08:55.290
lnstead of originals,
photocopies were submitted.

02:08:55.291 --> 02:08:58.040
Even the affidavits
didn't have your signatures.

02:08:58.791 --> 02:09:00.957
We lost 17 seats
without even contesting.

02:09:00.958 --> 02:09:03.415
Whose side are you on?

02:09:04.125 --> 02:09:06.249
l know whose side they're on.

02:09:07.916 --> 02:09:09.874
And who is behind this.

02:09:10.583 --> 02:09:12.249
Why did you do this?

02:09:12.875 --> 02:09:14.040
Why?

02:09:14.708 --> 02:09:16.624
Hang us if you wish, Veeru..

02:09:17.125 --> 02:09:18.874
We were compelled.

02:09:18.875 --> 02:09:21.540
You don't even deserve to be hanged.

02:09:22.083 --> 02:09:23.457
Veeru..

02:09:23.958 --> 02:09:25.165
Shut up!

02:09:25.875 --> 02:09:27.915
You leave. Leave.

02:09:27.916 --> 02:09:29.582
They were 23, now only 17 left, how?

02:09:29.583 --> 02:09:32.665
Six of Sooraj's men backed out.

02:09:32.916 --> 02:09:34.332
Exit poll result
for the first round.

02:09:34.333 --> 02:09:37.499
Of 73 seats, they're
predicting 45-47 for us.

02:09:37.500 --> 02:09:39.207
That's nonsense!

02:09:39.208 --> 02:09:41.332
Out of 73, we shall take 52.

02:09:41.333 --> 02:09:44.707
- Victory to Prithvi Pratap!

02:09:44.708 --> 02:09:46.582
- Victory to Jan Shakti!

02:09:46.583 --> 02:09:49.540
- Victory to Prithvi Pratap!

02:09:49.541 --> 02:09:53.249
- Victory to Jan Shakti!

02:09:53.250 --> 02:09:56.165
- Victory to Prithvi Pratap!

02:10:08.416 --> 02:10:09.707
l'm sorry.

02:10:17.791 --> 02:10:20.374
l failed to understand you.

02:10:29.333 --> 02:10:30.624
l love you.

02:10:41.166 --> 02:10:43.207
Even l love you very much.

02:10:46.125 --> 02:10:47.957
Just didn't know how to show it.

02:11:21.708 --> 02:11:23.999
You! You're the one l'll vote for.

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.749
For 25 years,
l voted for Rashtrawadi party.

02:11:26.750 --> 02:11:28.999
But this time, l will vote for you!

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.499
No one can defeat you.

02:11:31.500 --> 02:11:37.290
Victory to Prithvi Pratap!

02:11:40.166 --> 02:11:42.165
- Samar Pratap
seems to have boosted..

02:11:42.166 --> 02:11:44.415
- his brother Prithvi
Pratap's campaign tremendously.

02:11:44.416 --> 02:11:48.915
- in villages, towns, big cities,
in every corner of the state..

02:11:48.916 --> 02:11:52.374
The Election Commission rejected
our petition against Prithvi.

02:11:53.583 --> 02:11:55.040
- lt's waiting for
the court's decision.

02:11:55.041 --> 02:11:57.457
On the other hand, Prithvi Pratap..

02:12:04.541 --> 02:12:06.457
What the hell is going on here!

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:08.707
First Babulal..

02:12:09.666 --> 02:12:11.124
then Sharma..

02:12:11.916 --> 02:12:13.957
the nominations conspiracy!

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.457
That little brat..

02:12:18.250 --> 02:12:20.249
is now dictating our future?!

02:12:21.541 --> 02:12:23.374
And you, Sooraj?

02:12:24.250 --> 02:12:26.082
You can't do anything.

02:12:29.958 --> 02:12:32.540
lt will work out.
- Like hell it will!

02:12:33.666 --> 02:12:36.207
Just keep consoling me..

02:12:36.916 --> 02:12:38.957
since you can't
offer me any confidence!

02:12:44.750 --> 02:12:48.249
Veerendra Pratap doesn't need..

02:12:48.250 --> 02:12:50.957
anyone's support.

02:13:10.125 --> 02:13:11.249
lndu..

02:13:33.250 --> 02:13:34.540
Daya?
- Yes, sir? - Where are you off to?

02:13:34.541 --> 02:13:35.874
To the restroom, sir.

02:13:36.375 --> 02:13:38.332
They've to leave for
the airport. Hurry up.

02:13:52.541 --> 02:13:55.790
Samar!

02:13:56.208 --> 02:13:57.832
Wait!

02:13:58.416 --> 02:14:00.040
Don't go near the car. Step back!

02:14:01.833 --> 02:14:03.332
Take care of mother.

02:14:04.666 --> 02:14:06.082
Sarah, stop!

02:14:57.583 --> 02:15:20.749
"My beloved doesn't talk to me.."

02:15:22.041 --> 02:15:28.290
"He doesn't let me.."

02:15:28.958 --> 02:15:39.290
"He doesn't let me into his heart.."

02:15:40.125 --> 02:15:50.582
"My beloved doesn't talk to me.."

02:15:54.416 --> 02:15:56.832
The fever isn't subsiding at all.

02:15:57.291 --> 02:15:58.957
He is still passed out.

02:15:59.333 --> 02:16:01.749
Nothing seems to be going right.

02:16:02.916 --> 02:16:04.374
Everything will fall apart.

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.290
- Sir?
- Where ls Sooraj?

02:16:11.875 --> 02:16:13.874
What is the matter?

02:16:13.875 --> 02:16:16.040
- Where ls Sooraj?
- He ls sleeping.

02:16:16.041 --> 02:16:18.040
He has a fever.
Should l wake him up?

02:16:18.583 --> 02:16:20.082
No.

02:16:23.083 --> 02:16:24.624
You won't be able to see this.

02:16:24.625 --> 02:16:26.499
lt's better that you stay here.

02:16:26.833 --> 02:16:29.207
Sir.. please say something.

02:16:29.208 --> 02:16:30.832
What are you doing, sir!

02:16:30.833 --> 02:16:33.415
The family that fed you..

02:16:33.415 --> 02:16:35.999
supported you.. gave you a life.

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:37.749
He wants to
destroy that same family?

02:16:37.750 --> 02:16:40.457
Sooraj would never do that.
- He is doing it!

02:16:40.790 --> 02:16:42.915
You gave birth to a snake.

02:16:43.375 --> 02:16:44.790
That can't be!

02:16:44.790 --> 02:16:46.915
lf he were my own blood,
l would have believed it.

02:16:46.915 --> 02:16:49.832
But he is a blessing from God.
Everyone worships him.

02:16:51.665 --> 02:16:54.207
What did you just say?
- We were childless.

02:16:54.208 --> 02:16:55.999
lt was 27 years ago that..

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:57.457
l found him in a boat at sunrise..

02:16:57.458 --> 02:17:00.207
..near the Sukhamaniya ghats
at Benaras.

02:17:01.290 --> 02:17:02.790
He was wrapped in this cloth..

02:17:02.790 --> 02:17:05.207
and had this jewellery.

02:17:08.875 --> 02:17:10.499
No one knows about this.

02:17:11.040 --> 02:17:13.499
Sooraj himself doesn't know.

02:17:38.040 --> 02:17:41.624
How can Sooraj do this
to me when you are around?

02:17:59.458 --> 02:18:02.874
- l can't do anything to him.
- Why not?

02:18:05.750 --> 02:18:07.915
Because he is..

02:18:07.915 --> 02:18:09.874
your son.

02:18:10.833 --> 02:18:12.290
What?

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:20.999
Your first born..

02:18:22.415 --> 02:18:25.999
who l snatched from
your womb, 27 years ago.

02:18:55.750 --> 02:18:59.957
From here on,
you'll have to walk alone, sister.

02:19:26.165 --> 02:19:27.374
Please tell me..

02:19:28.415 --> 02:19:29.957
what l can do for you.

02:19:31.583 --> 02:19:34.999
An unfortunate mother has come
to ask forgiveness from her son.

02:19:37.125 --> 02:19:38.707
Your son?

02:19:39.750 --> 02:19:41.415
Who is your son here?

02:19:42.458 --> 02:19:44.207
You, Sooraj.

02:19:44.875 --> 02:19:46.415
You are my son.

02:19:48.958 --> 02:19:50.332
Listen..

02:19:51.375 --> 02:19:53.082
l understand you're in shock..

02:19:54.291 --> 02:19:55.749
l am sorry for your loss.

02:19:55.750 --> 02:19:57.124
No, Sooraj..

02:19:57.583 --> 02:19:58.999
it is true!

02:20:00.875 --> 02:20:03.415
Ram Charittar isn't your father.

02:20:05.041 --> 02:20:06.832
27 years ago..

02:20:07.208 --> 02:20:08.457
he found you..

02:20:08.458 --> 02:20:10.249
at the riverside in Benaras.

02:20:13.916 --> 02:20:15.624
What kind of a joke is this!

02:20:16.208 --> 02:20:19.540
Son, l gave birth to you.

02:20:19.541 --> 02:20:21.374
You are my first born.

02:20:23.125 --> 02:20:25.082
The elder brother of
Prithvi and Samar.

02:20:26.833 --> 02:20:28.415
You are lying!

02:20:29.208 --> 02:20:31.415
You want to protect your son.

02:20:38.458 --> 02:20:41.374
Your father was Bhaskar Sanyal.

02:20:42.791 --> 02:20:44.999
l worshipped him.

02:20:46.250 --> 02:20:48.540
One day, we got carried away..

02:20:48.833 --> 02:20:50.457
in a storm of emotions.

02:20:51.916 --> 02:20:55.415
He blamed himself..

02:20:55.416 --> 02:20:57.707
and forsook everything.

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.082
l was an unmarried girl.

02:21:02.833 --> 02:21:04.707
Please forgive me, son.

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:10.124
l was bound by the
limitations of my family's honour.

02:21:17.416 --> 02:21:19.457
So, why're you telling me this now?

02:21:20.666 --> 02:21:22.457
Come home, son.

02:21:24.333 --> 02:21:26.499
That is where you belong.

02:21:27.250 --> 02:21:29.999
Samar will happily accept you.

02:21:32.958 --> 02:21:36.082
The party will also get a boost.

02:21:38.666 --> 02:21:40.165
Moreover, you are the eldest.

02:21:41.625 --> 02:21:43.540
You should be the leader.

02:21:50.291 --> 02:21:51.874
Beg your pardon?

02:21:53.291 --> 02:21:56.207
Leader?! Wow!

02:21:57.541 --> 02:21:58.999
ln one breath you make me your son.

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:00.540
And in the next,
you play politics with me!

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.332
- No, Sooraj.. l was..
- do you really believe..

02:22:06.083 --> 02:22:08.582
that by dangling the promise of
power you can twist my integrity?

02:22:09.458 --> 02:22:11.874
You may have given birth to me..

02:22:12.125 --> 02:22:15.624
but l am the son of Ram Charittar
Kumar and Shanti Devi.

02:22:16.833 --> 02:22:19.582
My soul is that of a Dalit.

02:22:21.458 --> 02:22:23.207
Mrs. Bharati Pratap..

02:22:23.500 --> 02:22:27.582
l won't make the
same mistake you did.

02:22:28.833 --> 02:22:29.999
When l was down and out..

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:31.749
Veerendra Pratap supported me.

02:22:31.750 --> 02:22:33.540
Gave me respect.. and an identity.

02:22:35.208 --> 02:22:37.374
Only he has a right to my loyalty.

02:22:39.500 --> 02:22:41.915
Until my last breath
l will stand by him.

02:24:37.625 --> 02:24:39.332
Don't you trust me, father?

02:24:41.666 --> 02:24:44.999
l will never let the
Rashtrawadi Party go down.

02:24:46.583 --> 02:24:48.957
The final victory will be ours.

02:24:52.750 --> 02:24:55.290
God, it appears,
is testing us severely.

02:25:00.166 --> 02:25:02.082
But you will not break.

02:25:08.833 --> 02:25:10.249
Please lndu..

02:25:12.875 --> 02:25:14.832
you will have to be strong.

02:25:17.708 --> 02:25:19.790
You will have to be strong.

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:25.082
Everything is over.
- lt's over.

02:25:25.083 --> 02:25:26.957
- We Are orphaned.

02:25:27.208 --> 02:25:28.707
Samar..

02:25:28.958 --> 02:25:31.332
- now you Are our only hope.

02:25:33.666 --> 02:25:35.207
lt is true that..

02:25:37.166 --> 02:25:39.915
we have suffered a very tragic blow.

02:25:42.083 --> 02:25:43.999
But don't forget that..

02:25:45.125 --> 02:25:48.249
the resolve that our
leader Prithvi had undertaken..

02:25:49.958 --> 02:25:51.707
is alive even today.

02:25:54.041 --> 02:25:55.415
Brothers..

02:25:55.625 --> 02:25:57.290
nothing is over..

02:25:57.708 --> 02:25:59.374
and nor are we orphans.

02:26:04.291 --> 02:26:05.999
Come on.

02:26:08.875 --> 02:26:11.332
This is Mrs. lndu Prithvi Pratap.

02:26:12.041 --> 02:26:14.374
Jan Shakti party's new leader.

02:26:15.500 --> 02:26:17.957
Under her leadership,
we'll contest the elections..

02:26:18.416 --> 02:26:19.874
and be victorious!

02:26:29.291 --> 02:26:30.999
l, Brij Gopal..

02:26:31.708 --> 02:26:35.124
as the mentor of the
Jan Shakti Party..

02:26:35.583 --> 02:26:39.832
nominate Mrs. lndu Prithvi Pratap..

02:26:40.583 --> 02:26:43.999
as Jan Shakti Party's new president.

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:45.749
We support this nomination.

02:26:45.750 --> 02:26:49.374
- You have our support!

02:27:00.041 --> 02:27:03.457
- l..
- l, lndu Prithvi Pratap..

02:27:03.875 --> 02:27:09.957
take this vow,
in the presence of God..

02:27:09.958 --> 02:27:17.749
l will be a member of the
Jan Shakti Party for life..

02:27:17.750 --> 02:27:21.749
and follow every rule..

02:27:21.750 --> 02:27:26.540
and command of the party.

02:27:26.541 --> 02:27:29.082
- Long live Jan Shakti!
- Long live Jan Shakti!

02:27:29.333 --> 02:27:31.332
- Long live lndia!
- Long live lndia!

02:27:45.625 --> 02:28:45.457
- Victory to lndu Pratap!

02:28:51.791 --> 02:28:55.790
My tears haven't dried up yet.

02:28:57.541 --> 02:29:00.207
And l won't allow them to dry up.

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.707
Until l get an answer from you!

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:05.415
Tell me..

02:29:05.875 --> 02:29:08.290
how can you tolerate..

02:29:08.583 --> 02:29:11.415
these unending attacks on me?

02:29:12.916 --> 02:29:16.957
My father-in-law was
brutally murdered.

02:29:17.458 --> 02:29:18.999
But, you remained silent.

02:29:19.833 --> 02:29:22.957
His own son was humiliated..

02:29:23.208 --> 02:29:26.415
and driven out of his party.

02:29:27.875 --> 02:29:29.540
But, you remained silent.

02:29:30.250 --> 02:29:35.457
The henna applied on my hands
for my wedding hadn't even faded..

02:29:36.833 --> 02:29:40.957
and they mercilessly
made me a widow.

02:29:41.833 --> 02:29:45.207
But, even now, you remain silent!

02:29:45.583 --> 02:29:46.874
Why?

02:29:47.541 --> 02:29:49.124
Answer me!

02:29:49.916 --> 02:29:53.374
Are you going to vote
my family's killers..

02:29:53.375 --> 02:29:55.665
into power?

02:29:55.666 --> 02:29:57.457
No!

02:29:57.750 --> 02:29:59.915
ls this your sense of justice?

02:29:59.916 --> 02:30:01.582
- No!

02:30:01.583 --> 02:30:03.790
Does my sacrifice count for nothing?

02:30:03.791 --> 02:30:05.290
- lt does! lt does!

02:30:05.291 --> 02:30:07.040
Answer me!

02:30:07.041 --> 02:30:13.082
- lt does! lt does!

02:30:21.458 --> 02:30:25.249
All initial reports seem to point
towards a majority for lndu Pratap.

02:30:25.250 --> 02:30:28.999
After the history of conflict
with the Rashtrawadi Party..

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:32.249
violence was anticipated but..

02:30:32.250 --> 02:30:36.165
barring one or two incidents,
elections were peaceful.

02:30:36.166 --> 02:30:38.874
There were a few
complaints against the EVMs.

02:30:38.875 --> 02:30:40.165
From Bada Bazaar, in Balrampur..

02:30:40.166 --> 02:30:42.874
with cameraman Ram Narayan,
this is Mukta Tiwari for Star News.

02:30:42.875 --> 02:30:44.582
Muslims, Hindus, all..

02:30:44.750 --> 02:30:46.374
seem to be in one line.

02:30:46.791 --> 02:30:49.249
lt's entirely a one-sided contest.

02:30:49.958 --> 02:30:51.999
The widow is going
to sweep it all away.

02:30:56.208 --> 02:30:58.124
Hello, sir.
- Hello.

02:30:58.541 --> 02:31:01.040
How're things?
- Here we had no problems but..

02:31:01.416 --> 02:31:03.540
reports from other areas
aren't too encouraging.

02:31:05.458 --> 02:31:08.540
- Most exit polls
predict 120-130 seats..

02:31:08.541 --> 02:31:11.832
- for the Jan Shakti
party led by lndu Pratap.

02:31:11.833 --> 02:31:13.374
- Victory to lndu Pratap!
Long live lndu Pratap!

02:31:13.375 --> 02:31:15.499
- lf the result goes this way then..

02:31:15.500 --> 02:31:18.540
- in the 207-member
legislative assembly..

02:31:18.541 --> 02:31:20.540
- Jan Shakti will
hold a clear majority.

02:31:20.541 --> 02:31:22.457
- the party workers of Jan
Shakti Are already celebrating.

02:31:22.458 --> 02:31:25.665
- on the other side, the Rashtrawadi
party office ls a picture of gloom.

02:31:25.666 --> 02:31:27.457
What is the report?

02:31:27.458 --> 02:31:29.415
- there seem to have
been some stray complaints..

02:31:29.416 --> 02:31:31.207
- about the malfunctioning
of Electronic Voting Machines.

02:31:31.208 --> 02:31:34.040
The machine in our
booth just wasn't working.

02:31:34.041 --> 02:31:37.207
No matter which button we pressed,
the vote registered elsewhere.

02:31:37.208 --> 02:31:39.540
- From three other places,
similar complaints were..

02:31:39.541 --> 02:31:41.957
He has rigged the machines.

02:31:41.958 --> 02:31:43.249
l am dead sure!

02:31:58.666 --> 02:31:59.915
- Where ls the boss?

02:31:59.916 --> 02:32:02.082
He's been up all night
watching TV reports.

02:32:02.416 --> 02:32:03.957
lt's urgent.

02:32:03.958 --> 02:32:05.790
So, Raghav, tell me..

02:32:05.791 --> 02:32:07.832
are the voting machines
actually tampered with?

02:32:07.833 --> 02:32:10.040
- l'll just put him on.

02:32:10.041 --> 02:32:11.457
Sir..

02:32:12.666 --> 02:32:14.082
it's Moti.

02:32:14.791 --> 02:32:17.957
Some suspicious
activity at Bankepur.

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:23.957
- Tell me..
- Sir..

02:32:23.958 --> 02:32:27.374
Samar and his men are
here since last night..

02:32:27.375 --> 02:32:30.124
with computers,
antennae and other stuff.

02:32:30.125 --> 02:32:33.082
l heard they're tampering with
the voting machines by remote.

02:32:34.375 --> 02:32:36.207
What the..?

02:32:37.250 --> 02:32:38.874
Keep an eye on them.

02:32:38.875 --> 02:32:41.332
- l'm on my way.
- Okay.

02:32:46.416 --> 02:32:49.040
Follow me to the Bankepur area.

02:32:55.625 --> 02:32:58.082
Come on, hurry up.
- Hurry up!

02:32:59.750 --> 02:33:00.999
Where did he go?

02:33:01.625 --> 02:33:04.165
l have no idea. He just drove off.

02:33:04.166 --> 02:33:06.207
What do you mean?
Where was the security?

02:33:06.208 --> 02:33:08.332
- He must've said something.
- Nothing at all.

02:33:08.333 --> 02:33:09.957
He isn't answering his phone.

02:33:21.083 --> 02:33:23.957
- Yes, Sooraj.
Veeru.. Where Are you?

02:33:23.958 --> 02:33:26.582
Near the defunct
Bankepur cable factory.

02:33:26.583 --> 02:33:28.540
l'm on my way.
Don't get out of the car.

02:33:28.541 --> 02:33:31.707
By then that Samar would've
changed all the bloody votes.

02:33:31.708 --> 02:33:34.415
Come on.. that's impossible!

02:33:34.416 --> 02:33:37.499
What is impossible now is
to trust anyone, Sooraj.

02:33:37.958 --> 02:33:40.999
Using some fancy
hi-tech tricks, he is..

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:42.624
snatching our votes
from under our noses..

02:33:42.625 --> 02:33:43.874
and you say..

02:33:43.875 --> 02:33:46.374
Just don't get out of the car!
l'm on my way.

02:33:47.041 --> 02:33:48.332
He's here.

02:33:49.333 --> 02:33:50.540
Alone.

02:33:52.375 --> 02:33:54.040
Nobody shoots.

02:33:54.750 --> 02:33:56.707
His car is bullet-proof.

02:34:20.333 --> 02:34:22.665
Sooraj Kumar is here too, sir.

02:34:23.458 --> 02:34:24.915
Don't shoot.

02:34:34.041 --> 02:34:35.582
- Yes?
- Veeru..

02:34:36.375 --> 02:34:38.415
nothing happening here.

02:34:38.916 --> 02:34:40.374
lt's better we leave.

02:34:40.375 --> 02:34:41.957
Didn't you notice outside?

02:34:42.208 --> 02:34:44.082
l didn't see anyone outside.

02:34:45.250 --> 02:34:47.040
They're talking on the phone.

02:34:47.250 --> 02:34:49.582
We can't wait for long.

02:34:49.583 --> 02:34:52.332
They are hiding somewhere.

02:34:53.916 --> 02:34:56.415
l'll take a look.
- No! Don't step out.

02:34:57.791 --> 02:34:59.415
l'll have a look.

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:13.415
No one shoots..

02:35:13.875 --> 02:35:15.540
until Veeru steps out.

02:35:36.208 --> 02:35:37.749
Shoot, Sooraj!

02:35:38.166 --> 02:35:42.915
Shoot him, Sooraj!

02:36:26.250 --> 02:36:28.957
- Veeru.. Veeru..
- Huh?

02:36:48.500 --> 02:36:51.332
Don't close your eyes!

02:37:04.166 --> 02:37:06.957
Shoot! Shoot!

02:37:46.375 --> 02:37:47.832
Veeru..

02:38:16.666 --> 02:38:18.957
Let's finish this
war right here, Samar.

02:38:20.958 --> 02:38:22.207
Just..

02:38:22.666 --> 02:38:24.665
allow me to take
Veeru to the hospital.

02:38:25.625 --> 02:38:27.499
Then l'll come
wherever you want me to.

02:38:28.916 --> 02:38:31.165
My life is in your hands.

02:38:32.333 --> 02:38:33.957
l am bound by my commitment to..

02:38:34.291 --> 02:38:36.332
protect my friend.

02:38:37.708 --> 02:38:39.332
Come on, Veeru..

02:38:41.500 --> 02:38:43.290
What are you waiting for, Samar?

02:38:44.625 --> 02:38:46.207
He is unarmed.

02:38:46.666 --> 02:38:47.915
So?

02:38:48.250 --> 02:38:51.707
Did they kill your father
and brother on the battlefield?

02:38:52.666 --> 02:38:55.582
Don't get trapped in
questions of justice and ethics.

02:38:56.458 --> 02:38:57.957
This is the time!

02:38:58.541 --> 02:39:02.249
Don't lose sight of the goal
for which you entered this fight.

02:39:05.083 --> 02:39:07.207
Remember, in politics..

02:39:07.958 --> 02:39:09.957
victory is all that matters.

02:39:10.166 --> 02:39:11.999
And, your victory
will remain incomplete..

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:13.415
as long as he is alive.

02:39:13.416 --> 02:39:14.624
Come on.

02:39:14.625 --> 02:39:15.957
Finish him!

02:39:26.375 --> 02:39:27.790
Sooraj!

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:21.249
l..

02:40:22.125 --> 02:40:24.790
l, lndu Pratap..

02:40:25.208 --> 02:40:27.165
swear in the name of God..

02:40:27.958 --> 02:40:30.040
that l will uphold..

02:40:30.541 --> 02:40:32.957
the lndian constitution..

02:40:33.375 --> 02:40:35.999
with dedication,
honesty and respect.

02:40:36.708 --> 02:40:40.665
l shall always seek to preserve
the unity and diversity of lndia.

02:40:40.666 --> 02:40:43.540
As the Chief Minister of the state..

02:40:43.541 --> 02:40:46.124
l promise to perform my
duties with dedication..

02:40:46.125 --> 02:40:48.540
and a clear conscience.

02:41:07.166 --> 02:41:08.957
l never wanted to do..

02:41:11.166 --> 02:41:12.832
any of the things that l did.

02:41:17.958 --> 02:41:20.374
You, of all people,
know this, uncle.

02:41:23.333 --> 02:41:24.790
Please forgive me.

02:41:54.291 --> 02:41:55.665
l am sorry, lndu.

02:42:08.416 --> 02:42:10.374
l am sorry that l hurt you so much.

02:42:15.333 --> 02:42:17.790
l know that you may
never be able to forgive me.

02:42:23.916 --> 02:42:25.790
Do you really have to go?

02:42:30.125 --> 02:42:33.249
l always wanted to
stay away from politics.

02:42:37.041 --> 02:42:39.582
l feared the demons..

02:42:41.125 --> 02:42:42.957
that it brings out.

02:42:46.791 --> 02:42:48.790
But, that is exactly what happened.

02:42:51.666 --> 02:42:53.832
l couldn't escape my circumstances..

02:42:58.625 --> 02:43:01.040
and ended up losing everything.

02:43:07.125 --> 02:43:09.040
But, l know..

02:43:11.208 --> 02:43:13.457
l know that you're not like that.

02:43:15.041 --> 02:43:16.999
Your heart is pure.

02:43:18.375 --> 02:43:20.165
You'll be okay.

02:43:24.375 --> 02:43:26.332
My world was very different, lndu..

02:43:29.541 --> 02:43:31.665
in which l only had Sarah.

02:43:32.583 --> 02:43:34.790
Now, l must look after her mother.

02:43:37.083 --> 02:43:39.582
But, you'll have to return soon.

02:43:40.791 --> 02:43:43.957
There's something of
your brother with me.

02:43:44.625 --> 02:43:46.332
l am going to be the
mother of his child.

02:43:48.125 --> 02:43:49.665
Wow, lndu!

02:43:50.333 --> 02:43:52.165
Wow.. l mean that's..

02:43:53.583 --> 02:43:55.999
lt's been a long while since
this family received some good news.

02:43:56.916 --> 02:43:58.415
Congratulations!

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:01.874
Come back soon.

02:44:03.166 --> 02:44:04.874
Of course, l will.

02:44:05.708 --> 02:44:07.415
But on one condition.

02:44:09.375 --> 02:44:11.957
You have to come to receive me in
a car with the flashing red light.

02:44:23.291 --> 02:44:24.749
Bye.

02:44:34.958 --> 02:44:36.124
Sir, you?

02:44:36.458 --> 02:44:38.457
Ram Charittar is part of the family.

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:40.749
Where can he go?

02:44:41.875 --> 02:44:44.915
l am the one who has always
driven you to and from the airport.

02:44:48.291 --> 02:44:50.124
As a child, you played in my lap..

02:45:00.541 --> 02:45:02.540
Please, forgive me.

02:45:08.500 --> 02:45:09.957
No, uncle.

02:45:15.250 --> 02:45:19.999
"Dusky sky..

02:45:22.125 --> 02:45:26.457
..sees the earth."

02:45:30.666 --> 02:45:41.332
"This earth is money."

02:46:07.541 --> 02:46:15.165
"This earth bears when
there's bloodshed on the earth."

02:46:16.083 --> 02:46:25.582
"The river Ganges
flows on the back."

02:46:26.875 --> 02:46:34.957
"This earth bears when
there's bloodshed on the earth."

02:46:35.583 --> 02:46:44.957
"The river Ganges
flows on the back."

02:46:45.833 --> 02:46:50.540
"So many stars fell on
the ground and so many..

02:46:50.541 --> 02:46:53.957
..people lost their sons."

02:46:53.958 --> 02:47:02.790
"O earth. Earth is body.
Earth is money."

02:47:05.833 --> 02:47:22.290
"Earth is money."

02:47:27.416 --> 02:47:35.582
"This earth cuts into pieces
when there are distributions."

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:45.707
"This earth tears when
there's scarcity of water."

02:47:46.958 --> 02:47:55.124
"lt lives for a moment.
lt dies for a moment."

02:47:55.583 --> 02:48:04.999
"Earth is money."

02:48:23.666 --> 02:48:31.540
"Somebody wash the
stains on this earth."

02:48:32.333 --> 02:48:40.957
"Let the gardens of
the earth bloom again."

02:48:42.541 --> 02:48:50.540
"Thinking this earth turns
into dew drops every night."

02:48:50.750 --> 02:49:00.749
"O earth. Earth is money."

02:49:02.583 --> 02:49:27.290
"Dusky sky sees the earth."
