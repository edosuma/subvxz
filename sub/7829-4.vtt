"If I withhold the truth,

Milhouse, you did
the right thing.

02:26.604 --> 02:27.981
Bart, come with me
for punishment.

02:28.064 --> 02:29.691
You, too, snitchy.

02:29.774 --> 02:32.193
Now I want you to clean every
one of these organ pipes

02:32.277 --> 02:35.488
that you have befouled

02:42.412 --> 02:43.329
(door closing)

02:43.413 --> 02:44.330
You shank.

02:44.414 --> 02:46.374
How could you
tell on me?

02:46.457 --> 02:49.752
Well, I didn't want hungry
birds pecking my soul forever.

02:49.836 --> 02:54.048
Soul? Come on, Milhouse,
there's no such thing as a soul.

02:54.132 --> 02:56.009
It's just something
they made up to scare kids

02:56.092 --> 02:58.219
like the bogeyman
or Michael Jackson.

02:58.303 --> 03:00.763
But every religion
says there's a soul, Bart.

03:00.847 --> 03:02.223
Why would they lie?

03:02.307 --> 03:03.308
What would
they have to gain?

03:05.226 --> 03:07.353
I don't hear scrubbing.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.522
Well, if your soul's real,
where is it?

03:09.606 --> 03:11.566
It's kind of in here.

03:11.649 --> 03:12.984
And when you sneeze

03:13.067 --> 03:15.069
that's your soul
trying to escape.

03:15.153 --> 03:17.572
Saying "God bless you"
crams it back in.

03:17.655 --> 03:20.533
And when you die,
it squirms out and flies away.

03:20.617 --> 03:22.744
Uh-huh. What if you die
in a submarine

03:22.827 --> 03:23.786
at the bottom
of the ocean?

03:23.870 --> 03:26.080
Oh, it can swim.

03:26.164 --> 03:28.499
It's even got wheels in case
you die in the desert

03:28.583 --> 03:30.293
and it has to drive
to the cemetery.

03:30.376 --> 03:33.379
How can someone with glasses
that thick be so stupid?

03:33.463 --> 03:35.757
Listen, you don't have a soul,
I don't have a soul.

03:35.840 --> 03:38.551
There's no such thing
as a soul.

03:38.635 --> 03:39.761
Fine.

03:39.844 --> 03:42.138
If you're so sure
about that

03:42.222 --> 03:44.390
why don't you sell
your soul to me?

03:44.474 --> 03:45.808

03:45.892 --> 03:47.435
-Five bucks.

04:21.636 --> 04:23.429

04:23.513 --> 04:25.014
Oh, it is. It is.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.767

stools up to the pool table.

04:27.850 --> 04:31.312

Mm-hmm.

04:33.064 --> 04:34.482

Depository.

04:34.565 --> 04:38.319
Everybody is going to family
restaurants these days.

04:38.403 --> 04:41.114
Seems nobody wants to hang out
in a dank pit no more.

04:41.197 --> 04:43.533
You ain't thinking of getting
rid of the dank, are you, Moe?

04:43.616 --> 04:45.326
Ah, maybe I am.

04:45.410 --> 04:47.662
But, Moe, the dank, the dank.

04:47.745 --> 04:48.997
Yeah, family restaurants.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.832
That's where
the big bucks are.

04:52.625 --> 04:54.502
I could turn this joint
into a place

04:54.585 --> 04:57.130
where you wouldn't be ashamed
to bring your family, huh?

04:57.213 --> 04:58.298
I'm not ashamed.

05:00.091 --> 05:01.634

under that.

water all over me!

05:36.794 --> 05:38.254
(sighs)

05:38.338 --> 05:40.590
I wasted five bucks on these.

05:40.673 --> 05:41.591
Where did you get
five bucks?

05:41.674 --> 05:42.967
I want five bucks.

05:43.051 --> 05:44.761
I sold my soul
to Milhouse.

05:44.844 --> 05:47.472
What? How could you
do that?

05:47.555 --> 05:49.599
Your soul is the most
valuable part of you.

05:49.682 --> 05:51.559
You believe in
that junk?

05:51.642 --> 05:54.979
Well, whether or not the soul
is physically real, Bart,

05:55.063 --> 05:57.815
it's the symbol of everything
fine inside us.

05:57.899 --> 06:00.276
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Poor, gullible Lisa.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.487
I'll keep my
crappy sponges, thanks.

06:02.570 --> 06:05.490
Bart, your soul is the only
part of you that lasts forever.

06:05.573 --> 06:06.949
For five dollars,

06:07.033 --> 06:09.410
Milhouse could own you
for a zillion years.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.329
Well, if you think
he got such a good deal,

06:11.412 --> 06:13.581
I'll sell you my
conscience for 4.50.

06:13.664 --> 06:15.458
I'll throw in my sense
of decency too.

11:13.464 --> 11:16.133
It's not swim test anxiety.

11:16.217 --> 11:19.261
It almost feels like
you're missing something--

11:19.345 --> 11:20.429
something important.

11:20.513 --> 11:21.597
Like I don't have a soul?

11:21.681 --> 11:23.182
(laughing)

11:23.265 --> 11:25.309
Ah, honey,
you're not a monster.

11:33.359 --> 11:34.902
GIRL:
My soul's my best friend.

11:34.985 --> 11:37.196
GIRL 2: My soul's like a toy
that never breaks.

11:40.741 --> 11:42.243
(cackles)

11:42.326 --> 11:43.994
My soul can take your soul!

11:44.078 --> 11:46.455
<i>♪ Bart sold his soul,</i>
<i>and that's just swell ♪</i>

11:46.539 --> 11:48.666
<i>♪ Now he's going</i>
<i>straight to ♪</i>

11:48.749 --> 11:51.043
<i>♪ Hello operator,</i>
<i>give me number nine ♪</i>

11:51.127 --> 11:52.628
<i>♪ And if you disconnect... ♪</i>

11:52.712 --> 11:55.256
No soul, huh?
Don't worry.

11:55.339 --> 11:57.425
I'm still behind you.

11:57.508 --> 11:58.676
Ha-ha.

11:58.759 --> 11:59.969
Ahoy there, friends.

12:00.052 --> 12:01.804
Everybody find
a first mate.

12:01.887 --> 12:03.806
Oh, I choose Martin.

12:23.325 --> 12:24.827
Wait. Wait for me!

12:26.746 --> 12:28.622
(singsongy) Bart, it's time
to end this dream,

12:28.706 --> 12:31.333
and don't forget
the standard scream.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.210
(screaming)

12:38.799 --> 12:41.343
An alligator with sunglasses?

12:41.427 --> 12:43.179
Now I've seen everything.

12:43.262 --> 12:45.598
Hiya, folks.
Welcome to Uncle Moe's.

12:45.681 --> 12:48.726
Ah, look at all
the cute little minors.

12:48.809 --> 12:51.771
Wow. That's Moe.
The guy from the ad.

12:51.854 --> 12:53.230
Right this way, Homer.

12:53.314 --> 12:55.232
And he knows my name.

12:57.151 --> 12:58.778
Street signs indoors?

12:58.861 --> 13:00.404
(giggles)
Whatever.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.406
Now Rod, you order
anything you want

13:02.490 --> 13:04.241
for your big ten-o.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.243
Million Dollar Birthday Fries.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.037
Uh-oh.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.997
Moe gets so excited
when you order

13:10.080 --> 13:11.832
his Million Dollar
Birthday Fries

13:11.916 --> 13:14.126
he just has to celebrate.

13:14.210 --> 13:16.128
Here you go.
Here I am, Uncle Moe.

13:16.212 --> 13:17.129
Thank you, ma'am.

13:17.213 --> 13:18.297
This'll be a treat.

13:18.380 --> 13:20.716
Uncle Moe,
here I am, while you eat.

13:25.304 --> 13:26.889
Please take the fries
off my head, kid.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.766
The basket is extremely hot.

13:28.849 --> 13:31.352
How are the southwestern
pizza fingers?

13:31.435 --> 13:32.853
They're, um...

13:32.937 --> 13:34.647
"awesomely outrageous."

13:34.730 --> 13:35.981
Oh, these look good.

13:36.065 --> 13:37.775
Guilt-free
steak fish filets.

13:37.858 --> 13:39.485
No, no, let me level
with you, Marge.

13:39.568 --> 13:40.611
That's just our name

13:40.694 --> 13:41.904
for bottom-feeding
suction eel.

13:41.987 --> 13:43.405
You don't want that.

13:43.489 --> 13:46.325
Why don't you try
Moe's Hobo Chicken Chili?

13:46.408 --> 13:48.953
I start with the best part,
the neck,

13:49.036 --> 13:51.455
and then I add
secret hobo spices.

13:51.539 --> 13:53.415
Ooh, <i>tres bien.</i>

13:53.499 --> 13:54.583
Yeah.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.544
(giggles)

13:56.627 --> 13:58.712
What the hell are you doing,
you little freak?!

13:58.796 --> 14:01.006
(crying)

14:01.090 --> 14:02.550
Oh, sorry, kid.
Sorry.

14:02.633 --> 14:03.926
I'm not used to the
laughter of children.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.970
It cuts through me
like a dentist's drill.

14:06.053 --> 14:08.055
But no, no, that was funny,
that was funny

14:08.138 --> 14:09.640
taking away my dignity
like that.

14:09.723 --> 14:10.641
Ha, ha, ha.

14:10.724 --> 14:12.226
I would like
to say grace.

14:12.309 --> 14:14.019
(clears throat)

14:14.103 --> 14:16.230
Lord, have mercy
on my soul

14:16.313 --> 14:17.731
and Mom's soul

14:17.815 --> 14:19.567
and Dad's soul

14:19.650 --> 14:21.068
and Maggie's soul

14:21.151 --> 14:23.988
and that every soul
in Christendom-- Uh!

14:24.071 --> 14:25.197
Bart!

14:25.281 --> 14:26.490
I can't take
this anymore.

14:26.574 --> 14:28.534
I want my soul,
and I want it now.

14:28.617 --> 14:31.829
Bart, you didn't finish
your spaghetti and Moe Balls.

14:31.912 --> 14:33.163
<i>HOMER'S BRAIN:</i>
<i>Silence, you fool.</i>

14:33.247 --> 14:34.290
<i>It can be ours.</i>

14:35.499 --> 14:36.625
Run, boy!

14:36.709 --> 14:38.085
Run.

14:38.168 --> 14:42.172
(chewing)
Run for your life... boy.

14:45.843 --> 14:48.262
Milhouse! Milhouse.
You win!

14:48.345 --> 14:49.680
I want this nightmare to end!

14:49.763 --> 14:52.057
(creaking)

14:52.141 --> 14:53.434
(deep breathing)

14:55.394 --> 14:57.104
(sinister voice)
Leave this place.

14:57.187 --> 14:59.732
You are in great danger.

14:59.815 --> 15:01.775
Where's Milhouse?

15:01.859 --> 15:04.570
The one you call
Milhouse is gone.

15:06.447 --> 15:08.657
(normal voice) He went to his
grandma's place

15:08.741 --> 15:09.825
while we're spraying
for potato bugs.

15:11.619 --> 15:13.621
Oh. When Milhouse left

15:13.704 --> 15:15.706
did you notice if he was
carrying a piece of paper?

15:15.789 --> 15:18.042
Oh, yeah. You don't forget
a thing like that.

15:20.044 --> 15:21.003
(alarm sounding)

15:21.086 --> 15:22.004
Oh, God.

15:23.964 --> 15:25.382
Here you go!

15:25.466 --> 15:27.551
Here I am, Uncle Moe!
Thank you, ma'am.

15:27.635 --> 15:29.845
This will be a treat.
Uncle Moe! Here I am!

15:29.929 --> 15:31.263
-While you eat!
-Yay!

15:31.347 --> 15:32.765
Now do it
for Terri.

15:32.848 --> 15:34.099
What? It's your
birthday too?

15:34.183 --> 15:35.809
BOTH: We're twins.

15:35.893 --> 15:36.894
(sighs)

15:36.977 --> 15:38.312
Here you go.
Here I am.

15:38.395 --> 15:40.064
Eat your fries.
Eat them.

15:40.147 --> 15:41.732
Here's you.

15:41.815 --> 15:45.069
Ah, geez. And you got
the stink lines and everything.

15:48.364 --> 15:50.574
Oh, dude,
you did not smile.

15:50.658 --> 15:51.992
We eat for free.

15:52.076 --> 15:53.661
Come on, Shoshanna,
let's roll.

15:53.744 --> 15:54.995
(chuckles)

15:55.079 --> 15:56.580
But I sang you
the potato stuffings.

15:56.664 --> 15:59.375
Come on, I sang you
the potato stuffings!

15:59.458 --> 16:01.293
Look at the vein
on that guy's forehead.

16:01.377 --> 16:02.544
He's gonna blow.

16:02.628 --> 16:05.130
(alarm sounding)

16:05.214 --> 16:07.049
Unky Moe?

16:07.132 --> 16:09.551
What... is it,
sweetheart?

16:09.635 --> 16:10.970
My "sodie" is too cold.

16:11.053 --> 16:12.471
My "teef" hurt.

16:12.554 --> 16:14.848
Your "teef" hurt, huh?
Your "teef" hurt?

16:14.932 --> 16:16.058
Well, that's
too freaking bad!

16:16.141 --> 16:17.393
Ya hear me?
I'll tell you

16:17.476 --> 16:19.269
where you can put your
freaking "sodie" too!

16:19.353 --> 16:21.730
(all gasping)

16:21.814 --> 16:24.358
-Ow! My freaking ears!
-(gasps)

16:24.441 --> 16:25.943
Oh, let's go, dear.

16:26.026 --> 16:27.403
I expect that type
of language at Denny's

16:27.486 --> 16:28.362
but not here.

16:30.072 --> 16:31.156
Come on, folks, wait!

16:31.240 --> 16:32.408
Please, come back!

16:32.491 --> 16:33.951
Please, I got a new
offer.

16:34.034 --> 16:35.786
Whenever Uncle Moe threatens you

16:35.869 --> 16:37.746
you get a free
steak... fish.

16:37.830 --> 16:38.747
(sighs)

16:41.625 --> 16:43.168
Okay. Okay.

16:43.252 --> 16:45.713
Milhouse's grandmother
lives on 257th Street

16:45.796 --> 16:47.464
and I'm on Third.

16:47.548 --> 16:48.590
(groans)

16:48.674 --> 16:49.633
(horn blaring)

16:54.388 --> 16:55.639
(pop!)

16:55.723 --> 16:57.641
Well finally, a little luck.

16:57.725 --> 16:58.600
(squeaking)

17:00.394 --> 17:02.479
(evil laugh)

17:02.563 --> 17:06.358
(crashing)

17:13.157 --> 17:16.285
(yelling gibberish)

17:16.368 --> 17:17.911
Son, you wait here
while Daddy tries

17:17.995 --> 17:19.955
to talk some sense into
this raving derelict.

17:21.415 --> 17:25.002
(gibberish)

17:25.085 --> 17:26.128
Now slow down,
slow down.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.258
Who's been stealing
your thoughts?

17:38.432 --> 17:39.683
-Hello, Ralph.
-(gasps)

17:39.767 --> 17:41.769
Um, hi, Bart.

17:41.852 --> 17:43.562
I know you from school.

17:43.645 --> 17:44.897
Yes.

17:44.980 --> 17:47.024
A simple proposition, Ralph:

17:47.107 --> 17:48.650
how would you like
to make a dollar?

17:48.734 --> 17:51.487
Uh... I don't know.

17:51.570 --> 17:52.738
All you have to do
is sign a paper

17:52.821 --> 17:54.990
that says I can
have your soul.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.283
I need a soul, Ralph.

17:56.366 --> 17:57.701
Any soul.

17:57.785 --> 17:58.702
Yours.

17:58.786 --> 18:00.621
(whimpers)

18:00.704 --> 18:01.955
(crying)

18:02.039 --> 18:03.707
Hey, what's going on
over there?

18:03.791 --> 18:04.958
(hissing)

18:06.752 --> 18:07.961
(pounding on wood)

18:10.297 --> 18:12.049
Go on, take it all.
Get it all out of here.

18:12.132 --> 18:13.133
You know, Moe,
you might want

18:13.217 --> 18:15.094
to keep the fire
extinguishers.

18:15.177 --> 18:16.720
Nah. Too many
bad memories.

18:16.804 --> 18:18.430
Well, look on the
bright side, Moe.

18:18.514 --> 18:20.265
You still got us.

18:20.349 --> 18:23.393
Yeah. You know, that actually
makes me feel a little better.

18:23.477 --> 18:24.895
HOMER: Why?

18:24.978 --> 18:26.522
That was the problem
in the first place.

18:26.605 --> 18:27.898
You were going broke

18:27.981 --> 18:29.566
because we were
your only customers.

18:29.650 --> 18:31.777
Wasn't that the problem
in the first place?

18:31.860 --> 18:33.904
That you were
going broke?

18:33.987 --> 18:35.739
Moe? Moe?

18:35.823 --> 18:37.241
Hey, Moe?

18:37.324 --> 18:38.992
Oh, you're thinking
about all the money

18:39.076 --> 18:40.285
you blew, aren't you?

18:40.369 --> 18:43.747
What was it,
$50,000, $60,000?

18:43.831 --> 18:45.332
Moe? Look,

18:45.415 --> 18:46.917
maybe it would help
if you went over

18:47.000 --> 18:48.585
all the mistakes you made
from the beginning.

18:48.669 --> 18:49.628
-Moe?
-What?!

18:49.711 --> 18:50.629
Let me get a pad.

18:53.590 --> 18:55.092
(snoring)

18:55.175 --> 18:56.593
(knocking on door)

18:56.677 --> 18:58.595
A caller at this hour?

18:58.679 --> 19:00.347
You dial 9-1,

19:00.430 --> 19:03.767
then when I say so,
dial 1 again.

19:03.851 --> 19:05.352
(panting)

19:05.435 --> 19:06.478
Milhouse, please.

19:06.562 --> 19:08.522
Bart, I can't play now.

19:08.605 --> 19:10.190
It's 2:00 A.M.

19:10.274 --> 19:12.234
Milhouse, I got to
have my soul back.

19:12.317 --> 19:13.694
I'll do
anything you want.

19:13.777 --> 19:15.904
Uh... well...

19:15.988 --> 19:17.406
Milhouse,
give him back his soul.

19:17.489 --> 19:18.532
I've got work tomorrow.

19:18.615 --> 19:20.117
I'm really sorry.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.869
I kinda traded
your soul to the guy

19:21.952 --> 19:23.453
at the comic book store.

19:23.537 --> 19:25.789
But look, I got
some cool Pogs.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.499
Alf Pogs.

19:27.583 --> 19:28.959
Remember Alf?

19:29.042 --> 19:31.128
He's back,
in Pog form.

19:31.211 --> 19:33.422
You traded my soul
for Pogs?!

19:33.505 --> 19:35.757
No-o-o-o!

19:35.841 --> 19:37.426
GRANDMOTHER:
Close that door.

19:37.509 --> 19:38.719
You're letting
the heat out.

19:38.802 --> 19:40.637
FATHER:
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

19:47.019 --> 19:48.687
If you're waiting for
the "Hi & Lois" signing

19:48.770 --> 19:50.647
it has been moved
to the Springfield Coliseum.

19:50.731 --> 19:52.399
Please, you have
something of mine

19:52.482 --> 19:53.692
on a little piece of paper.

19:53.775 --> 19:56.653
Oh. So you're Bart Simpson, eh?

19:56.737 --> 19:58.322
Well,
since my breakfast burrito

19:58.405 --> 19:59.656
is congealing rapidly,

19:59.740 --> 20:00.657
I will be blunt.

20:00.741 --> 20:01.658
You're too late.

20:01.742 --> 20:03.327
I sold your soul
last night.

20:03.410 --> 20:07.748
Yes, yes, I found a buyer
right away for that item.

20:07.831 --> 20:09.041
Who?

20:09.124 --> 20:10.834
I'm not at liberty
to divulge the party

20:10.918 --> 20:12.669
but they were most interested
in having possession

20:12.753 --> 20:13.795
of a little boy's soul.

20:15.839 --> 20:17.174
Excuse me.

20:17.257 --> 20:19.426
No banging your head
on the display case, please.

20:19.509 --> 20:21.637
It contains
a very rare "Mary Worth"

20:21.720 --> 20:22.721
in which she has
advised a friend

20:22.804 --> 20:24.556
to commit suicide.
Thank you.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.360
Are you there, God?

20:36.443 --> 20:39.863
It's me, Bart Simpson.

20:39.947 --> 20:42.074
I know I never paid too much
attention in church

20:42.157 --> 20:46.036
but I could really use
some of that good stuff now.

20:46.119 --> 20:47.621
I'm afraid.

20:47.704 --> 20:49.706
I'm afraid
some weirdo's got my soul

20:49.790 --> 20:52.417
and I don't know
what they're doing to it.

20:52.501 --> 20:53.919
I just want it back.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.422
Please.

20:57.506 --> 20:59.049
(sobbing)

20:59.132 --> 21:00.050
(whimpers)

21:00.133 --> 21:02.594
I hope you can hear this.

21:08.141 --> 21:10.769
Lisa? You bought this?

21:10.852 --> 21:12.562
With the change
in my piggy bank.

21:12.646 --> 21:14.481
There's no change
in your piggy bank.

21:14.564 --> 21:15.899
Not in any of the ones
you know about.

21:15.983 --> 21:18.777
Oh, Lis, thank you.

21:18.860 --> 21:20.320
Happy to do it.

21:20.404 --> 21:22.364
But you know Bart,
some philosophers

21:22.447 --> 21:24.825
believe that nobody
is born with a soul,

21:24.908 --> 21:25.867
that you have to earn one

21:25.951 --> 21:26.910
through suffering

21:26.994 --> 21:28.453
and thought
and prayer

21:28.537 --> 21:30.247
like you did
last night.

21:30.330 --> 21:31.498
Uh-huh.

21:31.581 --> 21:32.708
(gulping)

21:39.840 --> 21:43.593
Ha! It's like punting on the
Thames. Stroke. Stroke.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.389
Oh!

21:47.472 --> 21:49.433
