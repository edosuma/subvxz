00:02.212 --> 00:04.005
<i>Last season on Sneaky Pete...</i>

00:04.047 --> 00:05.632
There was a... a tyre swing.

00:05.673 --> 00:07.383
That's what I remember the most.

00:07.425 --> 00:09.344
Every summer, Grandpa would fix it.

00:09.385 --> 00:11.804
Pete, would you shut the hell up?

00:12.805 --> 00:17.143
Three years in here, I feel like I've spent
every moment of that listening to this crap.

00:19.646 --> 00:20.772
You're a con man.

00:21.189 --> 00:23.650
You, what? You tried to rob
a gun range at gunpoint?

00:23.691 --> 00:26.778
I get outta here in two days, you're not
even up for parole for another two years.

00:31.366 --> 00:32.784
Hi, Grandma, Grandpa.

00:32.825 --> 00:33.785
It's me, Pete.

00:33.826 --> 00:36.287
I called the whole family over,
all your cousins.

00:36.996 --> 00:37.914
<i>Great.</i>

00:38.790 --> 00:41.084
- Taylor, I love you.
- You should be with me.

00:41.751 --> 00:44.963
I should have said it on the day
he proposed, but I am saying it now.

00:45.004 --> 00:46.589
I want my money, Otto.

00:47.465 --> 00:48.508
Oh, motherfucker...

00:50.760 --> 00:52.095
I'm here to talk about this one.

00:52.136 --> 00:55.765
He's no use to you, but he's still the
father of my son, so, I need him alive.

00:55.807 --> 00:56.683
So, talk.

01:00.228 --> 01:01.271
What're you doing?

01:01.396 --> 01:04.566
Maybe there's still time
to un-ring that bell.

01:06.025 --> 01:08.861
I don't need the money.
I need someone to launder it.

01:09.654 --> 01:11.322
<i>I need you to tail somebody.</i>

01:11.489 --> 01:14.117
If we do this, you teach us some shit.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.910
You wanna learn something?
OK, fine, first lesson:

01:15.952 --> 01:17.912
lose the boyfriend, then we'll talk.

01:19.038 --> 01:21.791
- So, what's going on?
- I need to find someone who paints houses.

01:22.375 --> 01:23.668
And all I need to know...

01:24.586 --> 01:25.670
is who you want gone.

01:26.921 --> 01:27.922
You're looking at him.

01:29.549 --> 01:31.718
Everybody get on the fucking ground!

01:42.645 --> 01:47.025
There's a cop here looking for Pete,
a New York cop named Winslow.

01:47.108 --> 01:49.694
Listen to me, Carly, I want you to
tell them that you do not consent

01:49.736 --> 01:51.112
to a search of your residence.

01:54.073 --> 01:54.949
Audrey!

01:56.117 --> 01:57.076
I'm in trouble.

01:57.118 --> 01:58.369
Grandma!

01:58.953 --> 02:01.164
You can't be a part of this!

02:01.205 --> 02:02.081
I already am.

02:09.172 --> 02:10.048
Hey, Pete.

02:10.173 --> 02:11.382
Do I know you guys?

02:11.424 --> 02:12.300
No.

02:13.217 --> 02:14.135
Gina.

02:14.385 --> 02:16.095
I want you to take us to your mother

02:17.639 --> 02:19.182
and the $11 million.

02:24.270 --> 02:26.230
- Where's your mother, Pete?
- I don't know.

02:27.398 --> 02:28.316
You don't know?

02:29.067 --> 02:31.444
The fuck kinda stupid answer
is "you don't know"?

02:31.486 --> 02:33.780
What's to keep us
from snapping your string right now?

02:34.739 --> 02:37.992
Because I know how to find her
and you don't.

02:39.327 --> 02:40.828
Huh. Let's go, then.

02:43.247 --> 02:49.170
<i>♪ Set the sails
I feel the winds a'stirring ♪</i>

02:53.424 --> 02:55.593
<i>- ♪ Towards the bright... ♪</i>
- How did you, uh...?

02:57.303 --> 02:58.554
"How did we, uh," what?

02:59.013 --> 03:01.974
How... how'd you figure it out?

03:03.643 --> 03:04.560
My mother and me?

03:06.854 --> 03:10.525
None of the guys our employer hired
before us bothered to ask

03:10.566 --> 03:13.861
what else happened at Mount Vernon
the day the 11 million was stolen.

03:14.028 --> 03:16.823
They never figured out some fucking idiot
robbed a gun range.

03:17.323 --> 03:18.533
Although I do get that a lot.

03:18.574 --> 03:20.952
People asking what kind of fucking idiot
robs a gun range.

03:20.993 --> 03:21.869
Every day.

03:22.829 --> 03:26.666
Now, where we got smart was wondering,
what if you're not an idiot?

03:27.417 --> 03:29.669
First dot we connected
was the security guard.

03:30.002 --> 03:33.089
We could put him at the gun range
right before you made your entrance.

03:33.131 --> 03:35.216
Ten minutes later, he's back at work

03:35.842 --> 03:36.968
dying in the shootout.

03:37.009 --> 03:39.929
You were trying to hold him there, huh?
Keep him from getting back?

03:40.304 --> 03:43.433
It's too bad it didn't work.
I mean, you went to jail for fucking nothing.

03:43.474 --> 03:45.309
How, how'd you know that I was out?

03:45.685 --> 03:48.020
Oh, we got a guy, built a bot

03:48.646 --> 03:50.481
looks for anything to do with you
or your mother.

03:51.774 --> 03:54.652
Last week it sees your name pop up
on an airline ticket.

03:56.654 --> 03:59.323
<i>OK, two tickets for the 5:20
to Fort Lauderdale.</i>

03:59.532 --> 04:01.492
<i>You wanna go to Buffalo
or Fort Lauderdale?</i>

04:01.534 --> 04:04.120
<i>Do we only get to go
if we have good reasons for wanting to go?</i>

04:04.245 --> 04:06.748
- You didn't board the flight.
- No, I had to buy a ticket

04:06.789 --> 04:09.167
to get through security.
We were tracing a skip.

04:10.001 --> 04:11.294
My, uh, my cousin and me.

04:11.794 --> 04:12.712
Pretty blonde?

04:32.398 --> 04:33.274
Where you going now?

04:35.568 --> 04:37.820
I'm, uh, going to New York.

04:37.862 --> 04:40.281
Terms of my parole.
I'm not supposed to be in Connecticut.

04:40.740 --> 04:42.158
Just had to see the family, huh?

04:43.242 --> 04:47.413
We'll be watching them. You try warning them,
or we see them go into hiding...

04:47.455 --> 04:48.539
But you won't do that.

04:49.040 --> 04:51.209
Cos you're gonna be too busy
trying to find your mum.

04:51.876 --> 04:54.629
You got 72 hours
before we start clipping their wires.

04:55.254 --> 04:56.881
That pretty blonde girl goes first.

05:07.308 --> 05:09.644
- You should run.
<i>- It's 11 million dollars.</i>

05:10.102 --> 05:12.188
And what happens when the FBI
picks you up

05:12.230 --> 05:13.815
for what played out in Vince's poker room?

05:13.856 --> 05:16.150
- They're not even looking for me.
<i>- Their agent was shot.</i>

05:16.192 --> 05:17.568
Money is missing. They're looking for you.

05:17.610 --> 05:21.155
Wha... but they can't prove anything.
Marjorie, come on.

05:21.197 --> 05:22.281
<i>That's not what I mean.</i>

05:22.323 --> 05:25.117
If these two goons see you
getting scooped up by the FBI

05:25.159 --> 05:28.621
and they find out that you're not Pete,
what's to stop them from killing you?

05:28.955 --> 05:30.373
<i>Well, I'll think of something.</i>

05:30.414 --> 05:33.292
Marjorie, we're talking about
11 million dollars.

05:33.543 --> 05:35.378
Alright.

05:36.254 --> 05:37.755
How do you propose on finding it?

05:38.589 --> 05:40.842
- You don't have much to go on.
<i>- I know that</i>

05:40.883 --> 05:44.512
ten minutes after Pete robbed a gun range,
there was a big shootout

05:44.554 --> 05:46.305
that left a security guard dead.

05:46.430 --> 05:48.224
There's gotta be
something online about that

05:48.266 --> 05:50.351
and then I got their license plate number.

05:50.893 --> 05:53.771
Y'know, I just don't have a computer, so--

05:53.813 --> 05:55.147
Marius, I'm retired.

05:55.189 --> 05:57.066
I just need you to do a little bit
of research.

05:57.108 --> 05:59.193
- Then I will expect a lot of money.
<i>- OK, OK.</i>

05:59.235 --> 06:01.654
- I'll give you 5% of whatever I get.
<i>- Mm.</i>

06:01.696 --> 06:03.447
I wish I didn't answer this phone.

06:04.031 --> 06:04.907
Alright.

06:05.992 --> 06:08.452
I assume there was a threat to go along
with all of this?

06:08.494 --> 06:11.414
Yeah, they said they were gonna kill
the whole family starting with Julia.

06:11.455 --> 06:12.331
<i>Oh, that's great.</i>

06:14.542 --> 06:15.751
Bernhardt Bail Bonds.

06:16.002 --> 06:16.878
<i>Audrey?</i>

06:16.961 --> 06:18.880
Uh, no, this is Julia. May I help you?

06:18.921 --> 06:19.839
<i>Little Blondie?</i>

06:20.715 --> 06:21.632
- Uh...
<i>- Shit.</i>

06:22.008 --> 06:24.385
<i>You don't remember me? This is Luis.
Luis Mercado.</i>

06:24.427 --> 06:25.553
Of course I remember you.

06:25.761 --> 06:28.097
<i>Little Blondie,
answering the phones and shit.</i>

06:28.472 --> 06:29.557
<i>Hey, is Otto around?</i>

06:29.599 --> 06:30.474
Not right now.

06:30.850 --> 06:32.268
<i>OK. Well, have him hit me back.</i>

06:32.810 --> 06:35.104
- Can I ask what this is about?
<i>- Just have him call.</i>

06:35.146 --> 06:37.648
<i>Hey, I bet you don't still wear your hair
in pigtails?</i>

06:37.690 --> 06:39.609
Heh. Not so much.

06:40.067 --> 06:40.943
<i>Ha!</i>

06:50.912 --> 06:53.456
I'm starting to think
you're just making excuses to see me.

06:54.999 --> 06:58.628
I was running the numbers and I
thought you should hear this in person.

06:58.669 --> 07:00.504
Sounds like I'm gonna be disappointed.

07:00.755 --> 07:02.924
In order to launder your 150

07:02.965 --> 07:06.010
I'm gonna have to write fake bonds
for fake people

07:06.052 --> 07:09.513
and then put their fake deposits,
your cash, in the bank.

07:09.555 --> 07:12.516
That should take three to four months.

07:14.185 --> 07:18.147
If you need it faster,
you could take it to Mohegan

07:18.606 --> 07:20.441
turn it into poker chips.

07:20.691 --> 07:21.567
Let me guess.

07:22.318 --> 07:23.945
You Googled how to launder money

07:23.986 --> 07:26.155
and the plot of that movie
with Captain Kirk came up.

07:27.573 --> 07:28.449
You see it?

07:28.991 --> 07:29.867
It's good.

07:31.118 --> 07:35.539
Anyway, what they don't say in the film
is that the casinos now have RFID

07:35.581 --> 07:37.625
in the chips to show
that they've been gambled.

07:39.794 --> 07:41.420
You want to give the money back, huh?

07:42.630 --> 07:44.465
Don't forget why you're in this situation.

07:45.091 --> 07:48.636
You offered a service to get the father
of your son out of an early grave.

07:48.886 --> 07:53.057
You withdraw that service, what's to keep
something from happening to him?

07:53.099 --> 07:56.102
Or, God forbid,
someone you actually care about.

07:56.978 --> 07:58.396
Three months is too long.

07:58.854 --> 08:00.523
I need the money back by next week.

08:36.475 --> 08:40.688
You got me where I needed to go, but...
your heart didn't seem in it.

08:42.565 --> 08:43.441
Ah, shit.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.153
I hope you don't give me
a bad review on Yelp.

08:49.905 --> 08:51.615
You wanted to talk about something?

08:53.325 --> 08:55.995
Why d'you think Sean's
been going to Hartford so much?

08:58.080 --> 09:00.499
I haven't cared about Hartford
since the Whalers left.

09:02.960 --> 09:07.798
He's been lobbying to have Connecticut
do bail bonds like Kentucky.

09:09.050 --> 09:10.092
Where the state runs it.

09:10.509 --> 09:12.094
That would put him out of business.

09:13.012 --> 09:16.849
Not if he gets the contract to run it.

09:19.977 --> 09:22.188
That'd put Grandpa and Grandma
out of business.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.107
But you...

09:26.442 --> 09:29.987
would have a shit-ton of money
to help them in their retirement.

09:30.738 --> 09:34.825
I wait for Sean's deal to go through,
and then I divorce him

09:34.867 --> 09:39.663
get half of everything, and you and I
get married on a beach in Hawaii.

09:46.170 --> 09:47.421
You don't seem thrilled.

09:51.926 --> 09:52.802
Look, I...

09:54.470 --> 09:56.722
I like money as much as the next guy

09:58.641 --> 10:00.309
but I want to be with you now.

10:01.685 --> 10:02.895
Just gotta be patient.

10:07.274 --> 10:10.486
<i>We continue this romantic journey

10:16.450 --> 10:17.326
Asleep.

10:20.121 --> 10:21.080

10:22.081 --> 10:23.624

says pink is for babies.

10:27.169 --> 10:29.672

10:40.015 --> 10:43.102
Mr Ambien is dangling a good night's sleep.

10:44.436 --> 10:47.148
Sure. But I'm keeping track
of what you owe me.

10:47.648 --> 10:48.607
Of course you are.

10:54.405 --> 10:56.907
Hey, did Pete say
where he was going when he left?

10:57.408 --> 10:58.450
No. Why?

10:59.451 --> 11:00.870
I need to talk to him about something.

11:01.954 --> 11:02.830
Night.

11:21.640 --> 11:22.516
Hey.

11:22.558 --> 11:24.727
<i>Car belongs to a leasing company in Queens.</i>

11:24.768 --> 11:27.396
To get who leased it would require
tools and skills I do not have.

<i>What about...</i>

11:28.355 --> 11:30.691

<i>Ten minutes after Pete</i>

11:37.573 --> 11:38.657
<i>walked into a gun range</i>

11:38.699 --> 11:41.869
there was a shootout at a nearby
storage facility that left three dead.

11:41.911 --> 11:43.621
<i>- Two guards and--</i>
- And a security guard.

11:43.662 --> 11:46.707
Yes, and before he shuffled off
this mortal coil

11:47.082 --> 11:50.211
the guard said two people got away,
one of whom was

11:50.252 --> 11:51.754
<i>a white woman in her fifties.</i>

11:52.004 --> 11:55.257
<i>And having recently played Pete's mum,
I know that description fits.</i>

11:55.716 --> 11:59.970
So 11 million dollars was stolen
from a storage facility?

12:00.012 --> 12:01.847
<i>No. At least, not officially.</i>

12:01.889 --> 12:02.932
<i>In none of the reports</i>

12:02.973 --> 12:06.018
is there any mention of 11 million,
or anything else being stolen.

12:06.060 --> 12:07.269
<i>What does that tell you?</i>

12:07.645 --> 12:09.688
Well, it was stolen from a criminal.

12:09.730 --> 12:12.483
<i>That's right, and any criminal
with 11 million dollars</i>

12:12.524 --> 12:13.943
isn't just any criminal.

12:14.568 --> 12:16.779
It could be some hedge fund guy, I mean...

<i>With goons who threaten to kill a family?</i>

12:18.906 --> 12:21.992
<i>Marius, before you go looking

12:22.117 --> 12:24.245
I'd say your first order of business

You're quite the creature of habit.

13:47.911 --> 13:48.871
Fuck me.

13:48.954 --> 13:51.749
You gotta think about changing up
your hunting grounds, buddy.

13:51.790 --> 13:54.793
Yeah, I don't need any of your lessons,
asshole. What do you want?

13:54.918 --> 13:55.794
Open the door.

13:56.003 --> 13:57.254
I'm looking for Gina.

13:57.546 --> 13:59.131
You and Gina can go fuck yourselves.

13:59.173 --> 14:01.091
Hey, in ten seconds
I'm gonna call for the police

14:01.133 --> 14:03.093
and then I'm gonna tell 'em
I found the guy who took my wallet.

14:03.344 --> 14:04.803
I don't have your wallet.

14:14.938 --> 14:17.232
That's your wallet, asshole.

14:20.736 --> 14:21.612
Where is she?

14:22.154 --> 14:24.990
Grandma, I strongly suggest
that you don't do this.

14:26.158 --> 14:28.744
- Father Lebec is a man of God.
- He is a man.

14:29.411 --> 14:31.288
He, he could let it slip.

14:32.247 --> 14:33.749
I'll only tell him what he can hear.

14:33.791 --> 14:35.209
- I won't--
- Please, please, Grandma.

14:35.250 --> 14:37.753
Please, I'm... I'm begging you, OK?

14:38.796 --> 14:42.341
Not now. Just give it a week.
Let this blow over.

14:42.716 --> 14:45.302
It's gonna blow over in a week?
A cop was killed.

14:46.345 --> 14:49.598
Yeah, well, Fairfield's got the case.
They're not idiots but...

14:50.015 --> 14:51.183
they're idiot-adjacent.

14:53.685 --> 14:54.561
Grandma?

14:56.688 --> 14:57.940
Tell me you will hold off.

14:57.981 --> 14:58.857
OK.

15:00.776 --> 15:01.652
OK.

15:02.820 --> 15:04.113
I gotta go, alright?

15:04.613 --> 15:06.115
Where's Carly? She need a ride?

15:06.740 --> 15:08.117
She stayed at Julia's.

15:08.826 --> 15:09.701
OK.

15:13.497 --> 15:15.082
- Grandma?
- Yeah.

15:24.883 --> 15:26.343
You gonna do what he said?

15:27.928 --> 15:29.638
That's what confession was made for.

15:30.347 --> 15:32.558
So we can be absolved of our sins.

15:34.143 --> 15:38.439
You didn't do anything that needs absolving.
It was an accident.

15:38.856 --> 15:42.484
There's a long list of bad decisions
that put me in a car with a gun.

15:44.319 --> 15:45.279
I gotta run errands.

15:46.947 --> 15:48.115
I'll stop at the shop.

15:49.158 --> 15:53.203
How are you gonna handle all this?
Just drink and stare off into the distance?

15:54.746 --> 15:55.831
It worked before.

15:57.124 --> 16:00.335
Took you ten years to surface
when you came home from Vietnam.

16:03.464 --> 16:04.673
You don't have ten years.

16:24.568 --> 16:25.986
Oh, f...!

16:57.351 --> 16:58.227
You're awake.

16:58.602 --> 16:59.478
Barely.

16:59.895 --> 17:02.481
Hey, I see Ellen's backpack on the counter.

17:02.523 --> 17:03.690
<i>Yeah, so, apparently</i>

17:03.732 --> 17:07.069
someone left her lunch in there all weekend
and it smelled like a toxic waste dump

17:07.110 --> 17:08.153
so I bought her a sandwich

17:08.195 --> 17:09.279
<i>on the way to school.</i>

17:09.321 --> 17:12.324
- Did she take her old pink backpack?
<i>- Yes, she did, no fuss.</i>

17:12.491 --> 17:13.659
<i>See, I get away with stuff</i>

17:13.700 --> 17:15.827
because I am cool Aunt Carly.

17:16.370 --> 17:19.748
- Did you look inside?
<i>- We just grabbed it and ran. Why?</i>

17:19.957 --> 17:23.252
Oh, I just left some, uh, office papers

17:23.293 --> 17:25.045
<i>in there, I'll get 'em later.</i>

17:25.087 --> 17:26.630
I was wondering. It was kinda heavy.

17:26.672 --> 17:29.508
<i>Aren't there rules about how heavy
a kid's backpack should be?</i>

17:29.633 --> 17:33.303
Probably also rules about not sending kids
down the coal mines. Killjoys.

17:33.345 --> 17:36.265
<i>- Thanks for staying and wrangling.</i>
- Yeah, my pleasure.

17:36.306 --> 17:37.724
I like ta--

17:50.862 --> 17:52.364
- Where did he find you?
- The park.

17:52.656 --> 17:54.116
I told you to mix it up.

17:54.908 --> 17:56.660
We should get going before he shows.

18:00.122 --> 18:00.998
- Sorry.
- Gavin!

18:01.582 --> 18:03.333
- O... Open the door!
- It's OK, calm down.

18:03.375 --> 18:05.627
- Gavin!
- I know you set me up with those guys.

18:05.961 --> 18:07.838
What you did was part of the game.

18:11.300 --> 18:12.676
How much did they pay you?

18:15.804 --> 18:16.680
Five hundred?

18:17.973 --> 18:18.849
More?

18:19.474 --> 18:20.350
One large.

18:22.519 --> 18:26.898
Well, what if I pay you two the same to
figure out what hotel they're staying at?

18:26.940 --> 18:28.442
- How do we--
- You figure it out.

18:29.234 --> 18:30.110
Here.

18:30.485 --> 18:32.112
Here's their license plate number

18:32.154 --> 18:34.072
and I'll give you the rest
when you find them.

18:36.283 --> 18:37.159
Go ahead, take it.

18:39.036 --> 18:40.162
Adios, amigos.

18:45.792 --> 18:46.668
Asshole.

18:47.628 --> 18:48.795
- I'm the asshole?
- Yeah.

18:49.004 --> 18:49.880
You dumped me.

18:52.591 --> 18:53.467
It's good to see you.

18:54.509 --> 18:55.385
Just drive.

19:02.768 --> 19:04.061
I'm undercover security.

19:04.269 --> 19:05.604
I'm recording this conversation.

19:05.646 --> 19:07.481
I need to hear you say you agree
to come with me.

19:09.024 --> 19:10.275
I don't agree to come with you.

19:11.026 --> 19:12.110
Then I call the cops.

19:39.971 --> 19:41.515
Ellen took the wrong backpack this morning.

19:41.598 --> 19:43.058
Thanks, I'll get it to her.

19:43.100 --> 19:44.768
I better take the one she came with.

19:45.060 --> 19:46.395
You can get them both, end of day.

19:46.812 --> 19:50.232
I left her lunch leftovers in it
and if anybody accidentally opens

19:50.273 --> 19:52.609
that sucker, there is gonna be
an airborne toxic event.

19:54.277 --> 19:56.697
You know, you really should clean out
a backpack every night.

19:57.280 --> 19:59.408
- You're right.
- I'm sure you're really busy.

19:59.449 --> 20:00.325
I am.

20:00.492 --> 20:02.828
Probably why you had the au pair
drop Ellen off this morning.

20:03.286 --> 20:04.162
The au pair?

20:06.123 --> 20:07.499
That was my sister Carly.

20:07.874 --> 20:11.211
She went to this school for a year,
back when she was Ellen's age.

20:11.253 --> 20:13.922
I remember it because that was the year
our parents were killed

20:13.964 --> 20:16.299
by a drunk driver out on Redding Road.

20:20.554 --> 20:21.513
It's pink.

20:26.476 --> 20:27.936
Sorry, Mum. Sorry, Dad.

20:31.481 --> 20:32.357
Here you go.

20:43.994 --> 20:44.995
Wrong pink backpack.

20:45.662 --> 20:47.873
- Are you sure? It's the only one I saw.
- I'm sure.

20:49.750 --> 20:51.543
Oh... Wait, uh.

20:51.585 --> 20:54.755
Shelley wasn't feeling well this morning
and her mum picked her up

20:55.005 --> 20:57.257
and I think she has a pink backpack too?

20:57.299 --> 20:59.634
Shelley... Birse?

20:59.676 --> 21:01.344
No, Shelley Martin. Who's Shelley Birse?

21:01.386 --> 21:04.097
I must've heard it wrong
when Ellen said her name.

21:04.139 --> 21:06.141
Her mum is Sarah?

21:06.808 --> 21:08.643
- Gayle.
- Wow, I really got it wrong.

21:08.894 --> 21:10.437
- You want me to call--
- No, I got it, thanks.

21:11.897 --> 21:13.815
I really should be the
one to get it back...

21:14.733 --> 21:15.734
I need an address.

21:16.276 --> 21:18.695
<i>See, this is why they invented the internet</i>

21:18.737 --> 21:20.655
so that you could search
for this stuff yourself

21:20.697 --> 21:22.657
and not have your cop
brother do it for you.

21:23.116 --> 21:24.201
Gayle Martin.

21:25.285 --> 21:26.536
She better not be a skip.

21:26.578 --> 21:28.163
<i>She's the mother
of one of Ellen's classmates.</i>

21:28.205 --> 21:30.248
We're class mums for the aquarium trip.

21:30.499 --> 21:32.667
Wait, why, why can't the school office

21:32.709 --> 21:34.336
<i>- look her up for you?</i>
- Please don't make me lie anymore.

21:35.545 --> 21:37.172
I know, I know, I know...

21:39.800 --> 21:41.802
I shouldn't feel guilty,
the guy was a hitman

21:41.843 --> 21:44.805
it's the life he chose, he had to know
something could always go sideways.

21:48.850 --> 21:49.726
What?

21:50.685 --> 21:53.522
You don't feel guilty,
you feel embarrassed.

21:53.772 --> 21:56.233
You were wallowing in self-pity
and you know it.

21:56.274 --> 22:00.070
"Oh, poor me, nobody loves me,
nobody needs me

22:00.111 --> 22:01.446
I'd be better off dead."

22:01.488 --> 22:03.782
- Fuck you, kiss my ass.
- Tell me I'm wrong.

22:04.449 --> 22:06.576
I don't know what I was thinking,
asking you over.

22:07.285 --> 22:08.370
You hit on my wife.

22:08.411 --> 22:09.996
- I should punch you in the nose.
- Do it.

22:10.372 --> 22:13.166
Be better than you sitting around
feeling sorry for yourself.

22:13.208 --> 22:15.627
- Fuck you!
- You already said that.

22:20.465 --> 22:21.466
All that day

22:23.051 --> 22:23.927
I was...

22:25.595 --> 22:29.224
I just couldn't help thinking,
"This is the last time I see my wife.

22:31.351 --> 22:32.435
See this house."

22:35.355 --> 22:38.775
So nobly tragic, it was like an Irish play.

22:40.527 --> 22:42.696
"The last time I pick my nose.

22:42.737 --> 22:45.031
The last time I scratch me balls."

22:57.836 --> 22:59.546
I'd be more comfortable the old way.

23:00.630 --> 23:02.757
The new confessional will be ready
in a month.

23:04.301 --> 23:06.553
You know,
a lot of people prefer it this way

23:07.178 --> 23:09.222
just sitting and talking.

23:11.433 --> 23:12.309
Huh.

23:23.612 --> 23:25.614
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

23:37.500 --> 23:39.169
- I saw you.
- Did you?

23:41.755 --> 23:43.006
Oh, shit.

23:43.590 --> 23:44.674
It was that other girl.

23:45.342 --> 23:46.509
You were just the distraction.

23:47.427 --> 23:49.095
That's also how we got JFK.

How the fuck do you think it's going?

Yeah, and here I thought you Buddhists
were all zen and shit.

24:53.910 --> 24:57.122
Go to Burma, see how zen and shit
those guys are.

24:57.497 --> 24:58.373
What do you want?

24:59.332 --> 25:02.919
Yeah, I need a private conversation
with my old cellie, Pete Murphy.

25:02.961 --> 25:05.755
Is your fee still $50 in your commissary?

25:06.214 --> 25:07.090
<i>Not for you.</i>

25:07.632 --> 25:09.009
- Really?
<i>- For you it's 500.</i>

25:09.551 --> 25:10.969
- Why?
- You cheated at cards.

25:11.469 --> 25:13.680
<i>- The hell I did.</i>
- The thing with the ace.

25:14.431 --> 25:16.641
That was a trick!
I bet you a pack of ramen.

25:16.850 --> 25:18.268
<i>Maybe you could show me a trick.</i>

25:18.643 --> 25:19.936
You wanna learn a card trick?

25:20.020 --> 25:21.730
<i>I got visitation on Sunday</i>

25:21.771 --> 25:24.107
and it'd be cool to show my boy something.

25:27.360 --> 25:28.486
OK. Yeah.

25:28.528 --> 25:29.571
Get a deck of cards.

26:01.853 --> 26:04.105
Well... thought you'd come by.

26:04.147 --> 26:05.565
- Did the school call?
- The school?

26:05.774 --> 26:06.649
No.

26:07.734 --> 26:10.445
These kids, you know,
they always have to have the same clothes

26:10.487 --> 26:12.238
the same backpacks, the same...

26:15.283 --> 26:17.327
Oh, this is my brother, Desmond.

26:20.038 --> 26:21.748
You didn't say what your name was.

26:25.376 --> 26:27.879
<i>OK, so now you cut the cards which means--</i>

26:27.921 --> 26:29.672
I fucking know what
cutting a deck of cards means.

26:30.090 --> 26:32.884
OK. OK, so then, just do that

26:32.926 --> 26:34.260
and start turning them over.

26:34.594 --> 26:36.638
And just keep turning them over,
you can say things like...

26:36.971 --> 26:39.599
"Is this your card? Is this your card?"
You know, when you know

26:39.641 --> 26:41.226
<i>- it isn't.</i>
- Why would I do that?

26:41.267 --> 26:43.937
<i>- Just cos it's fun to get it wrong sometimes--</i>
- I don't wanna get it wrong.

26:43.978 --> 26:45.480
I want to impress my son.

26:45.522 --> 26:47.398
OK, right, of course.

26:47.440 --> 26:51.027
So then just keep turning cards over
and when you get to whatever

26:51.069 --> 26:54.781
<i>the bottom card was before you cut the deck</i>

26:55.031 --> 26:57.575
then you'll know that the next card
is gonna be the one that he picked.

26:57.992 --> 26:58.952
Is this your card?

27:00.495 --> 27:01.371
Yeah.

27:01.621 --> 27:03.081
<i>Don't just say "Yeah."</i>

27:03.123 --> 27:04.874
<i>Act surprised, you asshole.</i>

27:05.291 --> 27:06.835
<i>Yeah, that's my card.</i>

27:07.252 --> 27:10.380
<i>- You suck.</i>
- Tenzin, your son is gonna be surprised.

27:10.630 --> 27:13.675
<i>You're damn right he'll be surprised.
This is some David Copperfield shit.</i>

27:13.716 --> 27:14.676
Yeah, just keep practising.

27:14.717 --> 27:17.053
You know, you can try it out
on people at dinner or whatever.

27:17.220 --> 27:19.013
<i>- I will, man, thanks.</i>
- Yeah, you're welcome.

27:19.055 --> 27:21.516
So you think you can get the phone
to Pete today?

27:21.558 --> 27:22.433
<i>I will.</i>

27:22.475 --> 27:24.978
As soon as you put $500 in my commissary.

27:25.478 --> 27:27.230
<i>- Five hundred? What do you mean?</i>
- That's your price.

27:28.064 --> 27:30.608
<i>The trick was just so I didn't hang up.</i>

27:34.821 --> 27:36.281
Son of a bitch.

27:44.164 --> 27:45.081
Hey. Where?

27:45.707 --> 27:48.710
<i>- Don't you wanna know how?</i>
- Honestly, I really, I...

27:48.751 --> 27:50.420
We called around,
saying we need to find our bosses

27:50.461 --> 27:52.463
job's on the line,
here's the license plate.

27:53.089 --> 27:54.465
Brilliant. So where are they?

27:54.716 --> 27:58.595
Hotel on Bank. Room 1106.
Frank and Joe Hooper.

27:58.803 --> 27:59.804
Are they there now?

28:00.430 --> 28:03.266
<i>No car in the lot.
Called the room twice, didn't get an answer.</i>

28:03.308 --> 28:07.812
Good. So get a key card,
and one of you wait in the parking lot.

28:07.854 --> 28:09.898
<i>The other, make sure the room is empty</i>

28:09.939 --> 28:11.357
and wait inside.

28:11.733 --> 28:13.401
I'll see you there in 15 minutes.

28:13.443 --> 28:14.694
How do we get a key card?

28:15.195 --> 28:16.613
Hello?

28:21.284 --> 28:22.452
Finder's fee?

28:23.411 --> 28:25.538
Thinking it's more like a shakedown fee.

28:26.039 --> 28:27.165
Call it what you want.

28:28.499 --> 28:29.375
How much?

28:34.172 --> 28:35.173
Can't do that.

28:37.091 --> 28:39.052
Des, let's just call the cops.

28:39.093 --> 28:39.969
Good idea.

28:40.136 --> 28:41.763
Look, the money's not mine.

28:43.723 --> 28:47.018
Is it OK if I at least call the person
it belongs to?

28:48.102 --> 28:49.270
Call whoever you want.

28:53.149 --> 28:54.108
Mind if I smoke?

28:54.275 --> 28:55.193
Yes, I mind.

28:55.360 --> 28:57.070
There are children living in this house.

29:05.745 --> 29:07.330
Hey. It's Julia.

29:09.374 --> 29:10.250
Where are you?

29:11.376 --> 29:12.877
Because I got a big fucking problem.

29:20.051 --> 29:21.761
- May I help you?
- I certainly hope so.

29:22.262 --> 29:23.638
I left my key in the room.

29:24.013 --> 29:25.515
- Your name, sir?
- Hooper.

29:25.556 --> 29:26.432
Frank Hooper.

29:27.141 --> 29:29.310
- And your room number?
- 1106.

29:30.353 --> 29:31.354
Very good, Mr Hooper.

29:31.396 --> 29:32.438
Do you have some ID?

29:33.106 --> 29:34.899
I do, and I left it in the room.

29:34.941 --> 29:38.152
- If you wanna come up with me I can grab--
- I don't give a fuck

29:38.194 --> 29:39.904
why they call you Kid Charlemagne!

29:40.321 --> 29:41.197
Urgh!

29:41.572 --> 29:42.615
Your "patrons"?

29:42.657 --> 29:45.660
Your patrons left you in the red, asshole!

29:45.702 --> 29:48.371
All your low-rent friends are dead.
You gotta clean that mess up

29:48.413 --> 29:50.206
or we all end up in jail.

29:50.456 --> 29:52.709
The test tubes, the scale

29:52.750 --> 29:54.585
you gotta get that shit outta there!

29:54.627 --> 29:57.338
- Ma'am?
- Don't fucking "ma'am" me.

29:58.006 --> 30:01.592
"Is there gas in the car?"
Yes, there is gas in the car!

30:06.222 --> 30:07.265
"Kid Charlemagne"?

30:07.307 --> 30:10.476
Steely Dan song. A guy that age,
no way he'd know it.

30:12.145 --> 30:14.439
- You see how well I worked him?
- Pretty slick.

30:14.772 --> 30:16.858
It's good, you and me together again.

30:16.899 --> 30:17.775
Don't push it.

30:17.817 --> 30:19.736
- I'm just saying.
- I know what you're saying.

30:26.409 --> 30:27.410
- Gayle Martin?
- Yeah.

30:27.452 --> 30:28.703
- Where is she?
- Excuse me--

30:28.745 --> 30:30.288
- Julia!
- This is my house, excuse me!

30:30.330 --> 30:32.165
- Julia, are you OK?
- Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

30:32.874 --> 30:34.334
You're better than fine

30:34.375 --> 30:36.461
You're high as a fucking kite,
I can see it in your eyes.

30:36.502 --> 30:38.087
- Lemme see your arms.
- Who are you?

30:38.838 --> 30:40.548
Who am I? Who the fuck are you?

30:40.590 --> 30:41.549
Is this your dealer?

30:41.591 --> 30:43.092
Maybe I should ask to see his arms too!

30:43.134 --> 30:45.428
The fuck are you talking about?
You can see my arms!

30:45.470 --> 30:47.722
- Tom, Tom...
- What, what part of undercover

30:47.764 --> 30:48.848
do you not understand?

30:48.973 --> 30:51.184
Huh? Is that my money on the table
right there?

30:51.225 --> 30:53.186
I had it in Ellen's old backpack
and there was a mix-up--

30:53.227 --> 30:55.313
I swear to God, if you're lying to me,
your precious little Ellen's

30:55.355 --> 30:57.231
gonna go straight
to child protective services

30:57.273 --> 30:59.442
and you're not gonna see her again
until she ages out.

30:59.484 --> 31:01.152
- No, no, please, don't...
- She's not lying!

31:01.194 --> 31:02.236
- Yeah.
- She's not lying!

31:03.988 --> 31:05.323
Who the fuck are you?

31:05.365 --> 31:06.449
I'm her fucking handler!

31:08.368 --> 31:09.285
I'm her handler.

31:10.411 --> 31:11.287
Listen...

31:11.996 --> 31:15.041
we popped her with a balloon
up her asshole at BDL

31:15.083 --> 31:17.960
and if she wants to keep her kid,
she works for us.

31:19.504 --> 31:21.297
Stop it, stop, don't touch me.

31:21.339 --> 31:23.299
Don't touch me. Don't touch...
Oh, wait.

31:23.341 --> 31:24.509
Shit, shit, shit.

31:24.550 --> 31:26.219
- Who's that?
- You wanna keep your door intact

31:26.260 --> 31:27.178
hit the mute button.

31:29.472 --> 31:32.225
Uh, yeah, that's a...
that's a No Go on Geronimo.

31:32.517 --> 31:34.936
I repeat, that's an NG on G-mo.

31:35.978 --> 31:37.480
OK, thank you.

31:37.522 --> 31:38.398
Fucking SWAT.

31:38.439 --> 31:40.650
A day without a battering ram
is like a day without sunshine.

31:40.691 --> 31:41.651
You're DEA?

31:42.193 --> 31:44.070
I think that's probably the worst question

31:44.112 --> 31:45.655
you could've asked me
at this moment in your life.

31:46.155 --> 31:47.407
Get up.

31:47.448 --> 31:48.699
- Is that all of it?
- Yes.

31:48.741 --> 31:50.034
- Get it.
- Excuse me...

31:50.076 --> 31:52.453
Take this directly to the Turk,
and if he doesn't blow your brains out

31:52.495 --> 31:54.497
because you're late or because,
I don't know, it's Tuesday

31:54.539 --> 31:57.417
and if we're able to take him down,
then maybe, maybe I'm not gonna

31:57.458 --> 32:00.128
stuff your ass down the hole in Niantic.

32:00.253 --> 32:02.046
- Go! Jesus Christ.
- You can't just walk out the--

32:02.088 --> 32:04.632
Hey, listen. Wait 48 hours,
you call this number.

32:04.841 --> 32:07.260
Whoever answers the phone, you tell 'em
Chino told you to call.

32:07.301 --> 32:10.388
You give him your details and Uncle Sam
will send you $10,000

32:10.430 --> 32:11.931
to get the front door fixed, OK?

32:12.432 --> 32:13.808
The front door's fine.

32:14.809 --> 32:16.018
They don't have to know that.

32:22.775 --> 32:23.693
You slapped me.

32:23.776 --> 32:25.820
Yeah, well, they needed
a little bit of a jolt.

32:26.028 --> 32:28.197
You rolled with it pretty good.

32:28.865 --> 32:30.116
Is that the money for Dockery?

32:30.324 --> 32:31.200
Uh...

32:31.659 --> 32:33.411
Is it OK if I don't explain it right now?

32:33.453 --> 32:35.913
As long as you don't tell the rest
of the family that I'm still in Bridgeport.

32:36.539 --> 32:37.915
Why are you still in Bridgeport?

32:40.084 --> 32:42.753
Hey, you know that gun
you keep at the office?

32:45.131 --> 32:46.007
Carry it.

32:46.549 --> 32:49.177
- You think that they'll--
- I doubt it, but you never know.

33:01.647 --> 33:02.982
Sure you don't want one of these?

33:03.274 --> 33:04.150
No.

33:13.242 --> 33:14.202
What're you doing?

33:15.369 --> 33:17.163
Mr Orr's local news homework.

33:18.623 --> 33:21.792
Oh, homework is this thing
when you do schoolwork

33:21.834 --> 33:24.337
when you get home from school...?

33:24.378 --> 33:25.671
- Never heard of it.
- Yeah.

33:25.713 --> 33:26.589
Yeah.

33:37.767 --> 33:38.976
Hey, put that out.

33:39.018 --> 33:41.270
- I'm blowing it out the window.
- No, right now.

33:43.481 --> 33:44.357
OK?

33:50.613 --> 33:52.365
- Now drink it.
- Bite me.

34:00.706 --> 34:01.624
What's going on with you?

34:03.125 --> 34:05.253
You don't want any of the clothes
I lifted at the mall.

34:05.586 --> 34:08.089
- You're this rabid anti-drug narc.
- Yep, that's me.

34:08.881 --> 34:10.508
Is it because of all the family shit?

34:10.883 --> 34:12.843
The mysterious return
of your long-lost cousin?

34:13.261 --> 34:15.054
The thing with that fucked-up cop?

34:17.890 --> 34:18.891
I don't know, I just...

34:21.060 --> 34:21.936
I don't know.

34:21.978 --> 34:22.853
OK...

34:25.648 --> 34:27.858
- Holy shit balls.
- What?

34:29.986 --> 34:30.861
That's him.

34:31.821 --> 34:34.115
That's the fucked-up cop
that I pointed the shotgun at.

34:35.408 --> 34:36.284
He's dead.

34:36.617 --> 34:37.952
Yeah, I, I see that.

34:37.994 --> 34:38.995
Who killed him?

34:43.416 --> 34:44.792
You talked to Sam?

34:45.459 --> 34:47.712
He knows me better than anybody
other than you.

34:48.379 --> 34:49.422
He hit on me.

34:50.756 --> 34:51.924
We have that in common.

34:53.342 --> 34:54.385
He didn't get anywhere.

34:54.969 --> 34:56.387
We have that in common too.

34:57.471 --> 34:58.848
How'd it go with Father Lebec?

35:01.309 --> 35:02.935
I know you better than anybody.

35:09.025 --> 35:10.234
Well, it went just fine.

35:10.610 --> 35:11.694
Told him everything.

35:12.987 --> 35:16.324
He gave me three Hail Marys
and asked me to kill the Monsignor for him.

35:21.454 --> 35:22.496
I chickened out.

35:25.041 --> 35:26.459
Didn't tell him a damn thing.

35:29.253 --> 35:31.505
I know it was an accident and all, but...

35:34.175 --> 35:35.843
I shot a man in the head.

35:37.637 --> 35:38.512
Killed him.

35:46.395 --> 35:47.271
Hey, you busy?

35:47.605 --> 35:48.481
Frantically.

35:48.773 --> 35:50.816
Make sure we keep a space open in the lot.

35:51.192 --> 35:52.109
We getting a VIP?

35:52.151 --> 35:55.821
No, it's the death car of that NYP
detective who got popped in Brett Woods.

35:55.863 --> 35:57.031
Fairfield's sending it over.

36:14.507 --> 36:15.633
Bernhardt Bail Bonds.

36:15.758 --> 36:16.634
<i>It's Moe.</i>

36:17.968 --> 36:18.886
Oh, hey.

36:19.303 --> 36:20.680
You seen that Caddy
parked around the corner?

36:20.721 --> 36:21.597
<i>Huh?</i>

36:21.889 --> 36:23.391
<i>It belongs to the housepainter.</i>

36:23.766 --> 36:25.601
<i>It's been sitting there a couple of days.</i>

36:26.936 --> 36:28.437
What the fuck happened, Otto?

36:29.689 --> 36:31.857
- You really want to know?
<i>- No, I don't.</i>

36:32.066 --> 36:34.235
I just don't need this blowing back on me.

36:34.402 --> 36:35.528
My brother and all that?

36:36.237 --> 36:39.323
Just move the fucking car. OK?

36:39.365 --> 36:40.324
<i>You owe me.</i>

36:45.663 --> 36:46.539
Who was that?

36:48.416 --> 36:49.375
Oh, it's just, um

36:50.459 --> 36:51.335
just Moe.

36:52.628 --> 36:55.548
It's end of the month,
he wants me to settle my tab.

37:17.027 --> 37:18.195
<i>He was a dirty cop.</i>

37:18.654 --> 37:20.489
<i>Had a falling out with the guys paying him.</i>

37:21.198 --> 37:23.909
<i>They drove him off the road,
put two in his chest, one in his head.</i>

37:24.285 --> 37:25.327
<i>Like the pros do.</i>

37:25.745 --> 37:26.704
Hey, Bright Eyes.

37:27.371 --> 37:28.873
Nice to know you respond to Bright Eyes.

37:29.206 --> 37:31.292
Only called your name three times.
Where'd you go?

37:32.460 --> 37:35.087
I was just thinking about
when he came in, the cop.

37:35.463 --> 37:36.422
What was his name?

37:36.756 --> 37:37.631
Oh, Winslow?

37:38.674 --> 37:41.635
I can't tell you how many people come through
that door I would never remember but...

37:42.303 --> 37:43.179
I remember him.

37:44.180 --> 37:45.097
The eye, maybe?

37:46.891 --> 37:48.768
Why'd Fairfield send it over?
They gonna do more tests?

37:49.185 --> 37:51.645
Nah, they're getting ready to wrap it up.
No witnesses.

37:52.480 --> 37:54.899
Vic had a long list of dubious asterisks
next to his name.

37:55.524 --> 37:57.818
Looks like the usual
dirtbag-on-dirtbag crime.

37:59.403 --> 38:01.238
I know we're supposed to give a shit,
brother in blue and all

38:01.280 --> 38:03.240
but I don't think there's a lot of tears
being shed.

38:05.659 --> 38:06.702
Then why is it here?

38:07.870 --> 38:10.539
Some lady detective from the NYPD
is coming up

38:10.831 --> 38:13.542
unofficially, of course, to make sure
us Connecticut yokels

38:13.584 --> 38:15.252
aren't as stupid as everyone thinks we are.

38:16.045 --> 38:17.171
They say she's the best.

38:17.463 --> 38:18.964
Highest closure rate in the city.

38:19.632 --> 38:22.551
I'm sure she's gonna wanna talk to you too,
since you're the only one that saw the guy

38:22.593 --> 38:24.303
so be sure to comb your hair, huh?

38:35.731 --> 38:37.483
- Hey, it's me.
<i>- You're late.</i>

38:37.858 --> 38:39.568
Yeah, something came up with my cousin.

38:40.611 --> 38:41.487
Where are you?

38:41.737 --> 38:42.696
<i>In the room.</i>

39:03.467 --> 39:04.802
Son of a bitch.

39:05.761 --> 39:07.179
Son of a bitch what?

39:08.222 --> 39:09.098
Uh...

39:09.974 --> 39:12.977
I came to get something out of the truck
and forgot my keys.

39:13.811 --> 39:14.687
They're in your hand.

39:16.897 --> 39:18.816
Well. That just makes it worse.

39:19.733 --> 39:22.486
I'm just happy to know I'm not the only one
losing their mind.

39:23.487 --> 39:25.698
Well, thank you, sweetheart.
That's very kind.

39:26.574 --> 39:27.491
What're you doing?

39:28.576 --> 39:29.702
I gotta go see Moe.

39:41.505 --> 39:42.464
Taylor, call me.

39:42.631 --> 39:43.716
We may have a problem.

40:19.376 --> 40:21.712
Pete, hi, how ya doin', buddy?
Thanks for calling.

40:21.754 --> 40:24.548
- Hey, Marius. How you doing, man?
<i>- Yeah, good.</i>

40:24.590 --> 40:27.134
I was a little surprised
when Tenzin said you wanted to talk.

40:27.176 --> 40:28.302
It must be important. What's going on?

40:28.344 --> 40:30.512
All that time that we were in together

40:30.554 --> 40:33.641
you, you know, you'd talk about
your grandparents and your cousin

40:33.682 --> 40:35.643
<i>- and the farm and all that.</i>
- Yeah.

40:35.684 --> 40:37.853
<i>But you never once, uh,
mentioned your mother.</i>

40:39.521 --> 40:42.149
- Yeah, so?
<i>- Well, this is the weird part.</i>

40:42.191 --> 40:45.819
I got a call yesterday from a woman
who says that she was your mother

40:45.861 --> 40:49.073
<i>and she was checking in
to see how you were doing.</i>

40:49.114 --> 40:50.282
That wasn't my mother.

40:51.116 --> 40:53.786
<i>- Are you sure? Because--</i>
- Yeah, I'm sure I'm sure.

40:54.536 --> 40:55.537
My mother's dead.

40:55.829 --> 40:56.705
She's dead?

40:57.665 --> 40:58.540
When did that happen?

41:00.000 --> 41:00.876
What do you care?

41:01.126 --> 41:03.087
- Well, we're friends, man.
<i>- Three years ago.</i>

41:03.754 --> 41:05.714
<i>She died three years ago.</i>

41:10.970 --> 41:11.845
Fuck.

41:13.722 --> 41:15.182
Alright, alright, alright...

41:33.951 --> 41:34.952
Hey, how you doing?

41:38.080 --> 41:39.123
Come on in, Pete.

41:40.541 --> 41:41.417
You go ahead.

41:42.876 --> 41:43.752
Come on.

41:49.967 --> 41:50.843
On the bed.

41:51.969 --> 41:52.928
You're right here.

41:57.182 --> 41:58.058
You know, Pete

41:58.350 --> 42:01.103
I thought you had a clear understanding
of what we expected from you

42:01.812 --> 42:06.150
and you waste a day looking into us?
What do you wanna know?

42:08.235 --> 42:11.030
We solve crimes for people
who can't go to the police.

42:12.406 --> 42:15.409
Guy who hired us tried others before,
ex-Blackwater guys

42:15.868 --> 42:18.203
but they didn't know shit
about cracking a mystery.

42:18.245 --> 42:20.914
They never found out about you
or your mother.

42:21.165 --> 42:22.249
I almost had her.

42:24.501 --> 42:26.003
Six months ago in Sedona.

42:27.463 --> 42:28.922
Saw her cross a busy street.

42:29.631 --> 42:33.469
Don't know how I spooked her,
but spook her I did.

42:33.844 --> 42:34.720
Here.

42:35.554 --> 42:36.430
Take a look at that.

42:37.097 --> 42:39.433
It might answer any questions
you still have about us.

42:41.351 --> 42:42.603
Show Pete where you are.

42:45.481 --> 42:46.648
<i>Showtime.</i>

42:49.818 --> 42:50.778
Ring a bell?

42:52.112 --> 42:52.988
Get in closer.

43:09.797 --> 43:12.508
We told you what would happen
if you fucked around.

43:21.475 --> 43:22.351
<i>Just a sec.</i>

43:25.479 --> 43:26.355
Don't.

43:27.481 --> 43:28.357
Please.

43:28.899 --> 43:31.276
I know who you are.
You don't have to do this.

43:34.738 --> 43:35.614
<i>You don't.</i>

43:35.906 --> 43:37.825
<i>Oh, but I think we do, Pete.</i>

43:38.575 --> 43:39.952
Please don't do this.

43:44.456 --> 43:45.374
Jesus.

43:49.169 --> 43:50.045
Pete?

43:50.337 --> 43:52.422
- Get your gun and shoot through the door.
<i>- What?</i>

43:52.464 --> 43:53.340
Do it! Do it!

43:54.842 --> 43:56.301
<i>Goddammit...</i>

44:06.436 --> 44:07.855
<i>He warned her. She's got a Colt</i>

44:07.896 --> 44:08.981
pointed at your heart.

44:11.316 --> 44:12.234
Can I help you?

44:12.985 --> 44:14.570
Sorry. Wrong house.

44:19.074 --> 44:23.036
What're you doing? We're just gonna go back
after dark, plug her through the window

44:23.078 --> 44:24.079
when her kids are home.

44:26.707 --> 44:27.875
Then shoot me now.

44:28.750 --> 44:29.835
Cos if you don't...

44:30.169 --> 44:33.463
and you hurt her or anyone in that family,
I will get a gun

44:33.505 --> 44:34.798
and I will fucking eat it

44:34.840 --> 44:37.050
and you will never find my mother
or the money.

44:39.428 --> 44:40.929
Now you know who I am.

44:46.059 --> 44:46.935
Wow.

45:01.116 --> 45:02.117
Spread that out.

45:02.951 --> 45:03.827
Wh... why?

45:05.579 --> 45:06.622
Spread that out.

45:15.380 --> 45:16.506
What're you doing, man?

45:19.968 --> 45:21.303
You, you

45:21.845 --> 45:22.804
stand on it.

45:23.096 --> 45:24.097
No, man.

45:25.682 --> 45:26.767
Stand on it.

45:27.392 --> 45:30.562
What're you doing, man? This is bullshit.

45:32.689 --> 45:33.815
You don't need to do this.

45:36.151 --> 45:37.027
Look at him.

45:39.529 --> 45:40.405
Listen...

45:44.284 --> 45:45.160
Choose.

45:45.702 --> 45:46.578
Choose?

45:47.079 --> 45:48.288
What the fuck does that mean?

45:49.206 --> 45:50.082
"Choose"?

45:50.165 --> 45:52.709
Choose. Or I will do them both.

45:54.544 --> 45:55.504
- Me.
- Just shut up!

45:55.545 --> 45:56.421
You shut up!

45:56.713 --> 45:58.131
- A hero?
- Listen...

45:58.548 --> 45:59.925
Fuckin' love it when I get a hero.

46:00.801 --> 46:02.970
But sometimes, just to prove a point

46:04.263 --> 46:05.389
you have to do the other one.

46:06.139 --> 46:07.933
- Stop, stop--
- No, no, no...

46:11.520 --> 46:12.396
Or not.

46:18.860 --> 46:19.820
Stop, stop...

46:22.906 --> 46:24.116
Take it out, take it out...

46:32.541 --> 46:33.750
Now you know who we are.

46:35.919 --> 46:37.087
Roll him up, sweetheart.

46:39.006 --> 46:39.881
This is on you.

47:02.612 --> 47:06.241
You get squirrely, an anonymous call
goes to a local tip-line

47:07.159 --> 47:10.954
brings your friend here to light,
with your prints and your DNA.

47:11.872 --> 47:13.123
Take the fucking knife.

47:17.169 --> 47:18.045
The rags.

47:22.591 --> 47:23.467
Fill it in.

47:33.685 --> 47:39.858
<i>♪ Don't want no streetcar love
Oh, oh no ♪</i>

47:41.443 --> 47:47.949
<i>♪ One who'll carry out a one-hour ride
Oh no, oh no ♪</i>

47:49.534 --> 47:52.829
<i>♪ I just want a little girl to... ♪</i>

48:00.212 --> 48:03.006
We've gotten further than the muscle-heads
did before us

48:03.090 --> 48:06.426
which gives us some leeway,
but not an infinite amount.

48:06.676 --> 48:09.805
We don't have to kill anybody to give 'em
the worst fucking day of their lives.

48:10.430 --> 48:12.349
Remember that when you look at your family.

48:13.475 --> 48:16.520
By my watch, you have 48 hours
to locate your mother.

48:18.188 --> 48:19.064
Get out.

48:34.996 --> 48:35.872
Gina...

48:38.417 --> 48:39.292
I'm so...

49:25.505 --> 49:27.757
- What the actual fuck?
<i>- Look, I'm sorry about that--</i>

49:27.799 --> 49:31.386
You're sorry? I almost shot someone
through my door.

49:31.428 --> 49:32.888
<i>Yeah, I was, uh...</i>

49:32.929 --> 49:34.848
I was actually watching your house.

49:34.890 --> 49:35.765
What?

49:36.391 --> 49:40.353
<i>In case that Desmond guy came back.
I, I, uh, I didn't wanna tell you</i>

49:40.395 --> 49:43.231
<i>because I... I thought I was being paranoid</i>

49:43.273 --> 49:44.566
<i>and then I saw somebody walk up</i>

49:44.608 --> 49:46.485
and I got freaked out, uh...

49:47.736 --> 49:49.362
- so then I followed him.
<i>- Who was he?</i>

49:49.404 --> 49:50.947
This guy I almost shot?

49:50.989 --> 49:53.200
<i>He was just some guy
who was selling magazines.</i>

49:53.241 --> 49:54.117
Oh, for f...

49:54.993 --> 49:56.036
Why didn't you call me?

49:58.538 --> 50:01.500
- Uh, because my phone died.
<i>- Then you borrow a phone.</i>

50:01.541 --> 50:04.753
<i>You steal a phone!
I was freaking the fuck out.</i>

50:04.794 --> 50:09.216
<i>I had the kids go to Gloria's.
I didn't know if something happened to you.</i>

50:11.218 --> 50:14.596
Well, I'm fine, you're fine.
I overreacted. I gotta go.

50:14.638 --> 50:15.514
<i>OK?</i>

50:16.973 --> 50:17.849
Pete.

50:18.099 --> 50:18.975
<i>What?</i>

50:21.353 --> 50:22.729
Thanks for looking out for me

50:23.772 --> 50:27.317
but never do anything like that again.

50:30.153 --> 50:31.029
OK.

50:35.659 --> 50:39.788
Marius... that's seriously fucked up.

50:42.749 --> 50:43.625
I know.

50:48.088 --> 50:50.340
You said you'd kill yourself
if they harmed Julia?

50:50.382 --> 50:51.633
I had to say something.

50:55.595 --> 50:56.638
I spoke to Pete.

50:58.640 --> 51:00.016
He said his mother's dead.

51:00.517 --> 51:01.434
That is not good.

51:01.810 --> 51:03.895
No, it is. He's lying.

51:05.105 --> 51:06.731
He said she died three years ago

51:06.773 --> 51:11.069
but the two assholes said that they saw her
in Sedona six months ago.

51:11.319 --> 51:13.280
But Pete could really think she's dead, so.

51:13.780 --> 51:15.657
Either way, I gotta work him to find her.

51:15.699 --> 51:17.409
On the phone? You already tried that.

51:17.450 --> 51:18.827
- I know.
- You can't go and see him

51:18.868 --> 51:20.579
- you switched your records.
- I know that too.

51:20.620 --> 51:22.998
Well, how do you plan on working him?

51:23.164 --> 51:24.165
Face-to-face.

51:25.542 --> 51:26.710
You wanna get him out?

51:27.002 --> 51:28.253
Well, I don't <i>want</i> to.

51:28.295 --> 51:32.799
Even if it was possible, it would pose
an existential threat to you, Marius.

51:32.841 --> 51:35.218
If real Pete has any contact
with his family, you're burned.

51:35.260 --> 51:37.721
At best, you'll get popped
for identity theft.

51:37.846 --> 51:38.930
You'll go back to prison.

51:38.972 --> 51:42.350
At worst, you get stabbed in the heart
and rolled up in a shower curtain.

51:47.230 --> 51:49.357
I don't see that we have any other choice.

51:51.026 --> 51:53.320
When did this become "we"?
I thought I was doing some research.

51:53.361 --> 51:55.572
Straight split, minus expenses.

51:55.614 --> 51:57.407
That could be $5 million.

51:57.449 --> 51:59.743
That's retire-on-a-beach-in-Bali money.

51:59.868 --> 52:02.871
- I don't like Bali.
- So then retire to the Geordie shore.

52:08.126 --> 52:09.836
Getting Pete out of
prison would take weeks.

52:10.670 --> 52:11.671
Do we have weeks?

52:12.380 --> 52:14.007
No, we have tomorrow.

52:16.635 --> 52:17.510
Tomorrow.

52:18.845 --> 52:19.721
Yeah.

52:22.849 --> 52:24.726
How do you feel about going to prison?
