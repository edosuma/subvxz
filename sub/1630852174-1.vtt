09:16.514 --> 09:19.517
I guess I just don't
understand what purpose
you serve at Santa Inc.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.852
Are you a secretary who
sits in on big meetings?

09:21.936 --> 09:23.437
A waitress who
never has food?

09:23.521 --> 09:25.982
Junior, I am the number two
Executive Vice President

09:26.065 --> 09:30.152
at Santa Inc. who
only answers to Santa,
Brent, and the Board.

09:30.236 --> 09:31.904
I can end that
nose of yours.

09:31.988 --> 09:33.447
I'd like to see
you try.

09:33.531 --> 09:35.533
A lotta powerful people
need this nose to glow,

09:35.616 --> 09:36.993
so they can pay
their mortgages

09:37.076 --> 09:38.661
and send their kids
to private school.

09:38.744 --> 09:41.205
So, by all means,
go ahead and try

09:41.289 --> 09:43.040
to stop this nose
from glowin'.

09:43.124 --> 09:45.418
Goddammit,
you're right.

09:45.501 --> 09:47.211
Beings of Santa Inc.,

09:47.295 --> 09:50.339
It is I,
your Chief of Staff,
Jingle Jim.

09:50.423 --> 09:51.507
(chattering)

09:51.591 --> 09:53.592
Shut up,
you worthless assholes!

09:53.676 --> 09:56.137
-(all gasping)
-(coughs)

09:56.220 --> 09:59.348
I present Saint Nicholas XIX!

09:59.432 --> 10:00.725
(cheering)

10:01.976 --> 10:04.270
Thank you all
for the very warm welcome.

10:04.353 --> 10:06.480
I just wanna tell you all
that this year, we reached

10:06.564 --> 10:09.150
more kids than ever before.

10:09.233 --> 10:14.697
One billion six thousand--
No, wait, six, four, 16 billion?

10:14.780 --> 10:15.990
Holy-- That-- You know what?

10:16.073 --> 10:17.867
I'm not good
with these big numbers.

10:17.950 --> 10:19.535
We got a lot of these
little motherfuckers.

10:19.618 --> 10:23.247
(chanting "Santa")

10:23.331 --> 10:28.169
But, this Christmas Eve,
something happened
in Seattle, Washington,

10:28.252 --> 10:31.756
that left a lump
of coal in my heart.

10:31.839 --> 10:33.716
(rock music plays)

10:35.426 --> 10:37.470
Brent? I'm Jeff Bezos.

10:37.553 --> 10:40.139
Oh my god, Jeff Bezos.
I can't believe it's you.

10:40.222 --> 10:42.850
I would like for you
to come work for me at Amazon.

10:42.933 --> 10:44.852
Do I have to use
an Amazon Fire Phone?

10:44.935 --> 10:45.978
-No.
-I'm in.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.855
What?!
This is insane!

10:47.938 --> 10:49.023
Brent's a traitor!

10:49.106 --> 10:50.941
Amazon Prime is
slow and useless!

10:51.025 --> 10:52.526
Crowd Member:
Suck a bag of dicks!

10:52.610 --> 10:54.570
(Board members muttering)

10:54.653 --> 10:58.449
I know this is shocking news,
but please, please,

10:58.532 --> 11:00.201
let's just be happy for Brent.

11:00.284 --> 11:03.245
Let's wish him luck,
even though he screwed us.

11:03.329 --> 11:06.248
Without so much as a warning.

11:06.332 --> 11:08.542
He fucked us dry, folks.
I'm just gonna say it.

11:08.626 --> 11:11.754
The warning would've been lube,
but he withheld that.

11:11.837 --> 11:15.091
So, we are all
chafed this morning.

11:15.174 --> 11:17.218
Super chafed, but...

11:17.301 --> 11:20.554
this rash will go away,
just like Brent did.

11:20.638 --> 11:24.225
It won't spread from our nethers
to cover our entire body.

11:24.308 --> 11:26.560
We will recover

11:26.644 --> 11:30.773
from this un-lub-ri-cated

11:30.856 --> 11:32.983
fucking Brent gave us.

11:33.067 --> 11:35.236
Santa, I'm here
from The North Pole Times.

11:35.319 --> 11:37.488
Since Brent was supposed
to succeed you as Santa Claus,

11:37.571 --> 11:40.408
have you decided
who will replace him
and become your Successor?

11:40.491 --> 11:42.743
Subtext, Santa's old
and knocking on death's door.

11:42.827 --> 11:45.204
Fuck you, Harold.
Uh, I mean, uh, that--

11:45.287 --> 11:47.248
Good, good question.
I'll give it some
serious thought.

11:47.331 --> 11:49.500
Ha ha. Ho ho ho. Bye.

11:49.583 --> 11:51.961
(cheering)

11:53.129 --> 11:55.589
Big Candy:
I know who the next Santa is!

11:55.673 --> 12:00.302
Candy, tell him!
It's my son, your brother!

12:00.386 --> 12:03.472

12:08.185 --> 12:10.396

12:14.191 --> 12:16.444
How could Brent
just leave?

12:16.527 --> 12:17.862
He was my mentor.

12:17.945 --> 12:20.781
He taught me everything,
everything I know.

12:20.865 --> 12:22.950
He made me love my job.

12:23.033 --> 12:24.785
He made me love him.

12:24.869 --> 12:26.912
And then he didn't
even say goodbye.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.581
Aw, poor Candy.

12:28.664 --> 12:30.207
Poor sweet Candy.

12:30.291 --> 12:33.002
I'm here for you
if you need a shoulder
to cry on.

12:33.085 --> 12:34.753
Or a dick to cry on.

12:34.837 --> 12:36.881
Obviously,
that's offensive
and you suck,

12:36.964 --> 12:40.009
but I'm just curious
how you envision
that working.

12:40.092 --> 12:42.845
Is it like, I cry
and you use my tears

12:42.928 --> 12:45.681
as lubricant
to masturbate
to my sadness?

12:45.764 --> 12:47.683
Or is it like,
I cry and my tears

12:47.766 --> 12:51.145
fall off my face
onto your penis
with a kind of like,

12:51.228 --> 12:53.314
"thwap" sound that
gives you a boner?

12:53.397 --> 12:54.356
Ehhh.

12:54.440 --> 12:57.693
Candy Smalls.
Down, but not out.

12:57.776 --> 12:59.987
So, who do you
think is gonna
be the new Santa?

13:00.070 --> 13:01.989
50 bucks it's someone
in the toy factory.

13:02.072 --> 13:04.992
Or one of those fuckin'
jacked reindeers, am I right?

13:05.075 --> 13:07.286
Like Junior.
He's so fuckin' hot.

13:07.369 --> 13:08.621
I mean, he's so jacked.

13:08.704 --> 13:10.539
You fellas know
I meant jacked, right?

13:10.623 --> 13:13.834
Yeah, ha, ha,
like what if the next
Santa is a woman.

13:13.918 --> 13:16.170
That would be so weird,
but like super cool!

13:16.253 --> 13:19.173
-(both laughing)
-A woman Santa?

13:19.256 --> 13:21.342
What if she thinks she's
handin' out candy canes,

13:21.425 --> 13:23.677
and they turn out to be
some fuckin' tampons?

13:23.761 --> 13:25.721
What if her boobies
get caught in the chimney?

13:25.804 --> 13:29.350
Or even worse:
What if she falls
in love with the sleigh?

13:29.433 --> 13:32.228
(all laughing)

13:37.149 --> 13:39.235
(rustling)

13:44.657 --> 13:49.119
(ominous music plays)

13:49.203 --> 13:52.498
Oh, Grandpa.
What're you doing
out so late?

13:52.581 --> 13:55.084
Candy Cane Lane
is the best place
for anonymous

13:55.167 --> 13:57.127
sexual encounters.

13:57.211 --> 13:59.630
Can your heart even handle
a gang bang at your age?

13:59.713 --> 14:01.382
You know what?
Don't answer that.
I don't wanna know.

14:01.465 --> 14:05.344
I won't apologize
for being a vibrant
sexual being.

14:05.427 --> 14:08.556
Nobody should ever
have to apologize
for their secret desires.

14:08.639 --> 14:11.892
It's funny you should
say that because...

14:11.976 --> 14:15.813
well, well because
I wanna be the next Santa.

14:15.896 --> 14:19.692
-Really?
-Yeah, I've been dreaming
about it my whole life,

14:19.775 --> 14:21.944
but, you know, Brent's
always been Successor,

14:22.027 --> 14:25.573
so I never
thought about it
seriously until now.

14:25.656 --> 14:26.740
Is that nuts?

14:26.824 --> 14:29.076
There have been
many Santa Clauses

14:29.159 --> 14:30.578
throughout history.

14:30.661 --> 14:32.288
Some were loved.

14:32.371 --> 14:34.123
Others loathed.

14:34.206 --> 14:36.208
Great and mediocre.

14:36.292 --> 14:40.879
Attractive and gross.
10's and 2's.

14:40.963 --> 14:43.882
Santa Claus XVII
gave lavish presents

14:43.966 --> 14:45.509
to children in
the Third Reich

14:45.593 --> 14:48.345
and escaped
the North Pole
for Argentina.

14:48.429 --> 14:52.558
The point is, Candy,
Santa Inc. is a diverse place.

14:52.641 --> 14:55.185
Humans and magical
creatures of all

14:55.269 --> 14:57.438
races and religions
living together.

14:57.521 --> 15:01.275
But the position
of Santa has mostly been
a white man's game.

15:01.358 --> 15:03.277
There have been
women prime ministers,

15:03.360 --> 15:06.363
women presidents,
even a woman mechanic,

15:06.447 --> 15:10.784
but there has never, ever
been a woman Santa Claus,

15:10.868 --> 15:12.244
or a Jewish Santa Claus.

15:12.328 --> 15:14.413
Exactly! It's fucking crazy!

15:14.496 --> 15:15.956
Things have gotta change!

15:16.040 --> 15:17.333
Grandpa Smalls:
My advice to you is,

15:17.416 --> 15:20.794
and this is important,
so listen carefully--

15:20.878 --> 15:22.713
-(gust of wind)
-Whoa!

15:22.796 --> 15:26.091
(shouts):
If I die, get rid of my porn!

15:26.175 --> 15:31.680
It's on a computer icon
called, "Tax Stuff"!

15:33.515 --> 15:35.976
(TV playing)

15:36.060 --> 15:39.229
If you become Santa,
would you put me
on the Reindeer A-team?

15:39.313 --> 15:41.982
Hell yeah, I'd bump
you straight up
to varsity.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.692
Junior can take a year off.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.736
You could lead the sleigh,
and let the other jerks

15:45.819 --> 15:48.280
get stuck smelling
your asshole for once.

15:48.364 --> 15:50.574
-(baby cries)
-Get the fucking baby, Craig!

15:50.658 --> 15:52.785
Don't yell at me
in front of your friends.

15:52.868 --> 15:53.952
Then don't be a dumbass

15:54.036 --> 15:56.205
in front
of my friends, dumbass.

15:57.665 --> 15:59.333
I thought
things were better
between you guys

15:59.416 --> 16:00.376
since the baby.

16:00.459 --> 16:01.752
What do you mean?
They are.

16:01.835 --> 16:02.961
Now listen to me, bitch.

16:03.045 --> 16:04.880
If this is your dream,
you have to at least try

16:04.963 --> 16:07.424
and talk to Santa,
and make your case, bitch.

16:07.508 --> 16:10.636
Someone like me
doesn't just walk up
to Santa's house and be all,

16:10.719 --> 16:12.179
"Dude, we need to talk."

16:12.262 --> 16:14.181
Well, go there, bitch.
Right now.

16:14.264 --> 16:17.017
You gotta get intimate
with that jolly bitch, bitch.

16:17.101 --> 16:18.227
Okay, I know you're right,

16:18.310 --> 16:19.853
but do you really
have to call me "bitch"

16:19.937 --> 16:21.480
every time you say something?

16:21.563 --> 16:25.067
Yes, bitch.
Because it's empowering
to call you bitch, bitch.

16:25.150 --> 16:26.902
A man wouldn't mind
being called a bitch.

16:26.985 --> 16:29.363
-Craig: She's right.
-Who asked you, bitch?

16:29.446 --> 16:31.532
Craig: She's wrong.
That-- That does
sting a bit.

16:31.615 --> 16:32.908
Look, you need to let Santa know

16:32.991 --> 16:35.369
you're not on his "Nice" list
or his "Naughty" list.

16:35.452 --> 16:37.830
You're on his
"Bitch" list, bitch.

16:37.913 --> 16:39.623
Okay, fuck it.
I'm doing this.

16:39.707 --> 16:42.251
I'm doing this.
I'm going over
there right now.

16:42.334 --> 16:43.377
This is so exciting!

16:43.460 --> 16:45.838
It's stressing me out
how exciting this is.

16:45.921 --> 16:47.631
-(crunches)
-Dammit, I ate my arm.

16:47.715 --> 16:48.882
Wish me luck, bitches.

16:48.966 --> 16:50.926
-Woo! You go, Candy!
-Yes, you got this, bitch!

16:51.009 --> 16:52.302
You're gonna do it!

16:52.386 --> 16:54.471
-(door opens, closes)
-What if Candy gets to be Santa,

16:54.555 --> 16:55.597
then falls in love
with the sleigh?

16:55.681 --> 16:58.058
Bitch, I was thinkin'
the same thing.

16:58.142 --> 17:03.897
-(magical music playing)
-(gates creaking open)

17:13.824 --> 17:15.451
-Ahh!
-Oh god! I'm so sorry.

17:15.534 --> 17:18.037
Clumsy, stupid asshole!

17:18.120 --> 17:21.874
Okay, Jesus, I cannot take
on this energy right now.

I, I know it's late.

17:43.270 --> 17:44.772
Oh, I'm always up.

17:44.855 --> 17:46.398
(laughs)
I have insomnia.

17:46.482 --> 17:50.194
I stay up all night making
lists of what I need to do.

17:50.277 --> 17:52.654
It rules my life,
but who cares?

17:52.738 --> 17:55.157
You don't care!
I barely care!

17:55.240 --> 17:56.617
Come on in.

you're one cupcake
away from diabetes.

18:04.082 --> 18:05.459
Fine!
Then get me some donuts!

18:05.542 --> 18:07.461
We're all out.
I don't care,
I'm not picky.

18:07.544 --> 18:09.963
And can we not fight
in front of my colleague?

18:10.047 --> 18:12.132
Candy, come in. Sit down.

18:12.216 --> 18:15.761
Invitation accepted... sir.

18:21.683 --> 18:24.353
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'll leave you two
to talk business.

18:24.436 --> 18:28.690
I have emails to read,
and packages to wrap,
and so on and so forth,

18:28.774 --> 18:30.984
and, and goodbye.

18:31.068 --> 18:32.319
What brings
you here, Candy?

18:32.402 --> 18:34.112
First, may I say,
your home is lovely.

18:34.196 --> 18:36.532
It's, it's majestic,
yet it's not ostentatious,

18:36.615 --> 18:38.826
which, I think, is a subtle
balance to achieve, sir, and I--

18:38.909 --> 18:42.037
Jesus fuckin' Christ, Candy,
enough with the "sir."

18:42.120 --> 18:44.081
Loosen up. This isn't
the principal's office.

18:44.164 --> 18:45.415
I've known you
since you were a kid.

18:45.499 --> 18:47.501
Yeah, but it's not like
we ever really talked.

18:47.584 --> 18:49.878
What're you talkin' about?
We shoot the shit all the time.

18:49.962 --> 18:53.340
No. No, we've never shot
even one tiny shit, sir.

18:53.423 --> 18:56.134
I mean-- I met your husband.
He's a huge sports nut, right?

18:56.218 --> 18:57.761
Why am I even askin'?
I remember the guy.

18:57.845 --> 19:01.223
Blue skin, horse body,
pink wings. He was hilarious.

19:01.306 --> 19:02.516
Not married, actually.

19:02.599 --> 19:03.934
Don't even have
a crush on anyone,

19:04.017 --> 19:06.019
but, uh, don't be embarrassed.
It's fine. I--

19:06.103 --> 19:08.897
You're a very busy man.
You probably don't even
know my last name.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.774
Ah, come on.
Who gives a fuck?

19:10.858 --> 19:12.401
It's not like you
know my real name.

19:12.484 --> 19:13.819
It's Llewelyn Fartini.

19:13.902 --> 19:16.071
Dammit, you do!
Now that you mention it,

19:16.154 --> 19:19.199
Brent kinda was like
the buffer between us.

19:19.283 --> 19:20.993
But, you know,
now that I look back,

19:21.076 --> 19:24.538
Brent always acted like
he was meant for bigger
things than Santa Inc.

19:24.621 --> 19:26.540
One Halloween
he came as Super Jesus.

19:26.623 --> 19:28.125
Like regular Jesus
wasn't enough.

19:28.208 --> 19:30.544
No, Brent needed
a cape and a pair of tights

19:30.627 --> 19:33.297
to show off his biceps
and his huge fuckin' dick.

19:33.380 --> 19:35.883
No one with a dick
that big is happy
in middle management.

19:35.966 --> 19:39.303
-That segues into what
I'm here for, actually.
-It does?

19:39.386 --> 19:41.638
Do you mind if I,
uh, kinda give you
the big picture?

19:41.722 --> 19:42.723
Please, tell me.

19:42.806 --> 19:45.309
When I was a kid,
I had big dreams.

19:45.392 --> 19:47.644
You know, I, I didn't
know that, as a girl,

19:47.728 --> 19:49.688
they didn't always come true.

19:49.771 --> 19:51.440
I figured if
I worked hard enough,

19:51.523 --> 19:53.567
no one could deny
me anything, so I did.

19:53.650 --> 19:56.778
I, I worked my ass off,
and I proved myself.

19:56.862 --> 20:00.324
All right, not really a segue,
more of a pivot, but I hear ya.

20:00.407 --> 20:03.076
I want my dreams to come true.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.579
I wanna be the next Successor,

20:05.662 --> 20:10.292
and the first female
Santa Claus in history!

I'm a real change agent.

20:31.188 --> 20:33.607
I'm an ally,
which I can't
label myself as,

20:33.690 --> 20:35.400
but I've been labeled
that by others.

20:35.484 --> 20:37.277
And Brent,
the first Black Successor,

20:37.361 --> 20:39.154
was a huge part of my legacy.

20:39.237 --> 20:42.407
But maybe...
it's time to make history

20:42.491 --> 20:43.992
...again.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.911
I need to think about it,
but,

20:45.994 --> 20:47.371
this could be really
fucking awesome.

20:47.454 --> 20:49.039
Okay, very cool.

(cheers and laughter)

Let's see what those
bozos are up to now. Ha!

(indistinct chatter)

20:59.549 --> 21:00.509
What is this?

21:00.592 --> 21:02.135
It's my annual
Boxing Day party.

21:02.219 --> 21:03.929
Oh, I, I never
knew about it.

21:04.012 --> 21:06.223
We bros shave
our beards every year.

21:06.306 --> 21:07.933
It's a major tradition.

21:08.016 --> 21:09.851
I'm gonna win
again this year.

21:09.935 --> 21:12.145
The hair that weighs
the most gets a prize.

21:12.229 --> 21:14.064
Let's get shaving! Yeaaah!

21:15.148 --> 21:16.233
(buzzing)

21:17.943 --> 21:19.569
Jingle Jim,
why are you here?

21:19.653 --> 21:21.154
You don't even
have facial hair.

21:21.238 --> 21:22.572
I have to shave
every week.

21:22.656 --> 21:25.242
I'm talking about
my genitals, dumb-dumb.

21:25.325 --> 21:28.286
It's a gay thing.
Yes, I am gay.

21:28.370 --> 21:30.372
And it's a valid
and wonderful lifestyle.

21:30.455 --> 21:32.332
If I wasn't straight,
I'd be gay.

21:32.416 --> 21:33.625
It's number two
on my list.

21:33.709 --> 21:35.794
I shave, too.
I shave my legs.

21:35.877 --> 21:38.255
And under my arms,
and, uh, you know,

21:38.338 --> 21:40.674
all the parts of my vulva
that face the floor.

21:40.757 --> 21:44.594
Why have I never
been invited to this,
and Jingle Jim has?

21:44.678 --> 21:46.722
And Jeremy?
Jeremy's all ice!

21:46.805 --> 21:48.432
They make mine
into a snowcone.

21:48.515 --> 21:50.851
Candy, you're more
than welcome to stay,

21:50.934 --> 21:52.185
and, and join in.

21:52.269 --> 21:53.437
But, sir,
when you hired me,

21:53.520 --> 21:55.313
you knew I wasn't
trained for vaginas.

21:55.397 --> 21:58.358
I don't wanna be
sued if I slip up
and make her infertile.

21:58.442 --> 22:00.694
(softly):
The baby needs
the hair to stay warm.

22:00.777 --> 22:04.072
Ugh! Thanks for the info
on how my body works.

22:04.948 --> 22:06.158
I can't stay anyway.

22:06.241 --> 22:09.161
I've got a ton of parties
and raves and shit to go to.

22:09.244 --> 22:11.955
I mean, if I knew earlier
I could've switched stuff
around but--

22:12.039 --> 22:14.082
Oh, thank god. I mean,
I'll, I'll walk you out.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.877
And I'm gonna think hard
about what we spoke about.

22:23.175 --> 22:24.384
