WEBVTT

00:00.126 --> 00:03.238
- Previously on Wynonna Earp.
- We need to find out why Bobo

00:03.263 --> 00:05.863
- showed up at the homestead.
- Memories, they're coming back.

00:05.896 --> 00:08.532
Four days until the door opens.

00:08.565 --> 00:10.200
Bobo's throwing a party tonight.

00:10.234 --> 00:11.935
The whole town was invited. Damn!

00:11.969 --> 00:13.604
Black Badge needs you. I need you.

00:13.637 --> 00:15.272
So Bobo's gonna try again,

00:15.305 --> 00:17.141
cross the Ghost River
Triangle with the heir.

00:17.174 --> 00:19.723
We gotta stop all these people
from drinking the champagne now!

00:19.847 --> 00:21.945
One lucky contestant
will receive the antidote.

00:21.979 --> 00:24.715
Not good! All they have to do is

00:24.748 --> 00:26.884
bring me Ms. Wynonna Earp.

00:26.917 --> 00:28.886
- Willa!
- Do you remember me now?

00:28.919 --> 00:30.888
Yes, Robert.

00:32.523 --> 00:34.291
It can't be true! How could he
have poisoned the whole town?!

00:34.324 --> 00:37.594
- The champagne!
- We need her!

00:40.664 --> 00:43.400
- Everybody, just stay calm!
- We give this Bobo fella

00:43.434 --> 00:45.402
- exactly what he wants.
- What he wants

00:45.436 --> 00:48.105
- is our resident bitch!
- Not now, Alan!

00:49.406 --> 00:51.775
- You left!
- Why, I came back.

00:51.809 --> 00:54.244
- Yeah? Did you miss me?
- I never miss.

00:54.278 --> 00:56.313
Doc!

00:56.346 --> 00:57.789
You can't shoot them. I hate them and

00:57.814 --> 00:59.346
they hate me, but they're still humans.

00:59.349 --> 01:01.585
Hey, listen, we gotta
get you out of here.

01:01.618 --> 01:03.295
I hope my sisters made it out OK.

01:03.296 --> 01:05.489
- Don't worry, we'll find them.
- No, I'll find them.

01:05.522 --> 01:08.425
You get something that
will turn the townspeople

01:08.459 --> 01:11.361
from rabid, drugged-up assholes
back into regular assholes!

01:11.395 --> 01:13.163
- Get her!
- I'm sorry about this.

01:13.197 --> 01:14.531
- For what?
- Me too.

01:14.565 --> 01:16.467
What?! AAARGH!

01:18.135 --> 01:20.037
- Antidote?
- Weapons.

01:20.070 --> 01:23.073
Angry townspeople. I
like where this is headed.

01:23.106 --> 01:25.776
One, two, three, go!

01:29.646 --> 01:31.014
Ready?

01:32.983 --> 01:35.152
Let me just look at you for a second.

01:37.120 --> 01:39.122
Oh, you are so beautiful.

01:40.891 --> 01:42.893
I wasn't sure you'd remember.

01:42.926 --> 01:45.429
It all came flooding
back the second I stepped

01:45.462 --> 01:47.631
in the treehouse.

01:47.664 --> 01:49.733
"O ye of little faith."

01:49.766 --> 01:52.803
But I make up for it in other areas.

01:54.000 --> 02:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:02.579 --> 02:05.048
They'll be plenty of
time for that out there.

02:19.463 --> 02:22.399
It's working. It's actually working.

02:22.432 --> 02:24.735
You are the true heir,

02:24.768 --> 02:26.770
and the best damn thing I ever...

02:28.472 --> 02:30.140
- I'm fine.
- Are you OK?

02:30.173 --> 02:33.076
Robert! Robert.

02:33.110 --> 02:35.646
Back! Take me back!

02:44.955 --> 02:46.990
I don't understand.

02:47.024 --> 02:49.026
The prophecy,

02:49.059 --> 02:50.494
"The Willing Heir on the Winter Solstice

02:50.527 --> 02:52.429
with the Revenant of their Choosing..."

02:52.462 --> 02:53.931
Peacemaker.

02:53.964 --> 02:57.100
The heir ain't the heir without the gun.

02:57.134 --> 02:59.136
I have it.

02:59.169 --> 03:01.438
Bobo, I have it. Look.

03:01.471 --> 03:03.640
That's not Peacemaker.

03:03.674 --> 03:06.610
No. No.

03:06.643 --> 03:08.312
Waverly!

03:08.345 --> 03:10.280
Where is your sister, pretty lady?

03:10.314 --> 03:12.916
Come on, Waverly. We just wanna talk!

03:12.950 --> 03:14.985
Forget talking. Where's Wynonna?

03:17.754 --> 03:19.690
Bullshit, they do.

03:51.221 --> 03:53.454
I had Peacemaker in my hot little hand.

03:54.124 --> 03:57.127
- I was so close!
- Alright. Just concentrate, baby.

03:57.160 --> 03:59.162
If Wynonna took Peacemaker,

03:59.196 --> 04:02.065
- she knows we're together.
- There's no way.

04:02.098 --> 04:04.234
I've given her no reason to suspect me.

04:04.267 --> 04:07.270
- She's smart.
- She's a sucker.

04:07.304 --> 04:09.306
And Waverly is useless.

04:09.339 --> 04:12.042
- She's intuitive.
- What is this?

04:12.075 --> 04:14.811
Talk-about-how-great-my-
goddamn-sisters-are day?

04:14.845 --> 04:17.581
It's the one day a year this
thing's supposed to work!

04:17.613 --> 04:20.216
What are we gonna do?

04:20.250 --> 04:22.319
What are we gonna do?

04:22.352 --> 04:25.288
OK. That's OK.

04:27.090 --> 04:29.326
We have until sundown tomorrow.

04:29.359 --> 04:31.294
I'll go get Peacemaker.

04:31.328 --> 04:33.163
You hole up in our place.

04:33.196 --> 04:36.166
We bolt, and everyone else dies.

04:37.534 --> 04:39.836
You are one sick little
puppy, you know that?

04:39.870 --> 04:41.571
And you're all mine.

04:41.605 --> 04:44.241
Maybe we have time for a quickie.

04:44.274 --> 04:45.475
OK.

04:45.508 --> 04:47.811
You screw me, and then
we screw this town.

04:51.815 --> 04:54.818
You go get that gun

04:54.851 --> 04:56.820
and we'll do both.

04:56.853 --> 04:58.922
Go.

05:02.559 --> 05:05.295
We get a sample of the
poison that Bobo used,

05:05.328 --> 05:07.497
and maybe Black Badge can
reverse engineer a cure.

05:07.530 --> 05:09.330
There's a whole whack
of it in the basement.

05:09.332 --> 05:10.696
And you know this how?

05:10.697 --> 05:12.536
'Cause I was there
when Bobo's guy made it.

05:12.569 --> 05:15.272
Shh! Hear something?

05:15.305 --> 05:17.774
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

05:17.807 --> 05:19.657
I doubt this building's
up to code. You could burn

05:19.658 --> 05:22.345
- the building down.
- This coming from the lawman

05:22.379 --> 05:23.720
packing enough heat

05:23.836 --> 05:25.982
to firebomb Texas.

05:26.016 --> 05:29.085
- You got any dynamite in there?
- No.

05:30.954 --> 05:33.356
- Snookered yet again.
- Hey.

05:33.390 --> 05:35.992
Look, we gave Wynonna
a lick and a promise

05:36.026 --> 05:37.994
that we wouldn't take out any townsfolk,

05:38.028 --> 05:40.530
but a drugged-up mob
is not our only problem.

05:40.563 --> 05:43.533
- Where are the revenants?
- Oh, I doubt they're having tea

05:43.566 --> 05:46.636
- at the trailer park.
- You never know.

05:46.670 --> 05:49.506
We all have our vices.

05:49.539 --> 05:51.808
I think it's time

05:51.841 --> 05:53.743
we talked about yours.

05:53.777 --> 05:55.879
It's not what you think.
It's just medicine.

05:55.912 --> 05:58.448
Now see, that one I have heard before.

05:58.481 --> 06:00.350
I am a doctor.

06:00.383 --> 06:02.752
Look, I've taken this since I was a kid.

06:02.786 --> 06:06.156
It helps keep me alive
and some parts of me dead.

06:07.326 --> 06:09.059
Have you seen what's going on out there?

06:09.092 --> 06:10.994
The whole town's gone 5150!

06:11.027 --> 06:13.763
Whatever you've got planned, I'm game.

06:13.797 --> 06:16.633
Hey, this is classified.

06:16.666 --> 06:19.703
Purgatory's overrun by demon revenants,

06:19.736 --> 06:22.205
a. k. a. Wyatt Earp's
resurrected outlaws.

06:22.238 --> 06:24.641
Bobo Del Rey is their
leader. I am Doc Holliday.

06:24.674 --> 06:26.710
Yes, that Doc Holliday.

06:26.743 --> 06:29.079
And Dolls here, he is just a dick.

06:31.081 --> 06:32.515
Finally! Thank you.

06:32.549 --> 06:34.584
It... Actually, It makes perfect sense.

06:34.617 --> 06:37.687
Except for the last part.

06:39.022 --> 06:40.156
Hmm.

06:41.591 --> 06:43.360
You still in?

06:43.393 --> 06:45.562
Like Flynn.

06:45.595 --> 06:48.932
- What do you need?
- OK. Find the Earp girls.

06:48.965 --> 06:51.034
See if Nedley's still vertical.

06:51.067 --> 06:54.170
We've got an antidote to steal, people.

06:54.204 --> 06:56.940
And, Agent Haught,

06:56.973 --> 07:00.310
welcome to the Black Badge Division.

07:05.882 --> 07:07.751
Willa!

07:07.784 --> 07:09.753
Waverly!

07:09.786 --> 07:12.022
Oh-oh-oh-ow!

07:12.055 --> 07:14.224
Shitty shoes!

07:14.257 --> 07:16.493
Waverly!

07:21.031 --> 07:23.199
Guys!

07:29.506 --> 07:31.641
Now there's a sight for sore eyes.

07:40.683 --> 07:42.986
Pete.

07:43.019 --> 07:45.155
You remembered my name this time!

07:45.188 --> 07:47.223
It's not all I remember.

07:49.025 --> 07:51.594
I remember, in kindergarten,
you couldn't tie

07:51.628 --> 07:53.630
your shoes, so I wore

07:53.663 --> 07:55.965
Velcro sneakers in solidarity.

07:55.999 --> 07:58.134
I remember, in high school...

07:58.168 --> 08:01.538
You know what I remember?
How you broke my heart

08:01.571 --> 08:03.940
and slept with my brother,

08:03.973 --> 08:06.810
made fun of my mama's diabetes!

08:06.843 --> 08:08.511
Yeah, I was messed up.

08:08.545 --> 08:10.713
- But I'm not that person anymore.
- No,

08:10.747 --> 08:12.749
you're just wrong.

08:12.782 --> 08:15.518
Still wrong, and that Bobo guy knows it.

08:17.220 --> 08:20.356
You're a cancer on this town.

08:20.390 --> 08:22.859
A cancer that needs to be cut out.

08:22.892 --> 08:25.295
And I need that antidote.

08:25.328 --> 08:26.830
- Ah!
- Ugh!

08:26.863 --> 08:28.531
You're sick,

08:28.565 --> 08:31.301
but I can make you
better. I can stop Bobo.

08:31.334 --> 08:33.736
I don't want to hurt you.

08:33.770 --> 08:36.072
- Ugh! Ugh!
- OK.

08:36.106 --> 08:38.073
See, I don't have that problem.

08:38.107 --> 08:40.243
Willa! Oh, my God!

08:42.412 --> 08:44.080
Oh, fighting off the local boys

08:44.114 --> 08:45.982
in your underwear? Boy, you did grow up.

08:46.015 --> 08:48.051
- What happened to you?!
- I got separated

08:48.084 --> 08:50.086
from Waves. There was
clawing and kicking

08:50.120 --> 08:52.054
and some well-chosen cuss words,

08:52.055 --> 08:55.325
and then, next thing I know,
it was me and an empty...

08:55.928 --> 08:58.831
Wynonna, where's Peacemaker?

09:02.404 --> 09:04.487
Peacemaker was in the
purse at the party.

09:04.490 --> 09:06.474
You saw it, I saw it.
Now gone, vanished.

09:06.508 --> 09:08.843
- So you lost it?
- No. Someone took it.

09:08.877 --> 09:10.812
Well then, we're really fff...

09:10.845 --> 09:13.748
Phone. My cell died, but maybe Pete's...

09:15.747 --> 09:18.119
- Why aren't you more freaked out?
- Well, 'cause

09:18.153 --> 09:20.388
I can't dial the phone and throw a fit.

09:20.422 --> 09:23.992
Awww, he saved Waverly's
number under "Cuties."

09:24.025 --> 09:25.960
Could a revenant have nabbed it?

09:25.994 --> 09:28.363
No. It fries 'em if they touch it.

09:28.396 --> 09:30.131
She's not answering.

09:30.165 --> 09:32.200
- Hey!
- Look, I know you're worried

09:32.233 --> 09:34.803
about Waverly, but Bobo
has something up his sleeve.

09:34.836 --> 09:37.072
I mean, he's psychic
electric "Koolaided"

09:37.105 --> 09:39.074
all of those meatsticks!

09:39.107 --> 09:41.142
Finding Peacemaker
needs to be our priority.

09:41.176 --> 09:42.644
Aren't you?

09:42.677 --> 09:45.447
- What?
- Worried about Waverly?

09:45.480 --> 09:47.115
Of course.

09:50.418 --> 09:52.387
Why are you bothering with that?

09:52.420 --> 09:54.389
Just shoot him and be done with it.

09:54.422 --> 09:57.025
Pete's a dumb dude,
but he's not a revenant.

09:57.058 --> 09:59.794
None of them are. I
can't just kill them.

09:59.828 --> 10:02.530
- Would you?
- Sometimes, being an Earp means

10:02.564 --> 10:04.999
making tough decisions to survive.

10:05.033 --> 10:06.968
For the greater good.

10:07.001 --> 10:09.404
Yeah, well, if there's one
thing I've learned this year,

10:09.437 --> 10:11.372
it's that good is a moving target.

10:14.476 --> 10:17.445
I don't think that
thing's rung for 15 years.

10:24.753 --> 10:27.255
Hello. Woman-you-currently-want-to-kill.
Please be Waverly.

10:27.288 --> 10:30.258
No. But I've got her!

10:30.291 --> 10:32.927
Where are my manners?
This is Chrissy Nedley!

10:32.961 --> 10:36.197
- What do you mean, you got her?
- I found her

10:36.231 --> 10:38.032
and I chloroformed
her and I tied her up.

10:38.066 --> 10:41.002
All by myself! Can you come and get her?

10:41.035 --> 10:42.904
- Yes.
- And bring your head

10:42.937 --> 10:45.707
so I can chop it off to get
the antidote for me and my dad.

10:45.740 --> 10:48.676
I'm at his office. Bye!

10:48.710 --> 10:50.445
Chrissy, wait!

10:50.478 --> 10:52.614
Shit!

10:52.647 --> 10:55.583
Change of plans.
Super-fun-times Earp family reunion.

10:55.617 --> 10:57.337
Wait. I'm just wondering,
shouldn't we go and get...

10:57.338 --> 10:58.586
Peacemaker is just a gun!

10:58.620 --> 11:00.789
Waverly is Waverly.

11:00.822 --> 11:03.424
And Chrissy sounded like
she's sniffed enough glue

11:03.458 --> 11:06.361
to bankrupt a model airplane
factory. I'm not waiting to get her.

11:06.394 --> 11:09.264
And neither are you. She's our sister.

11:10.565 --> 11:12.901
As long as I get to kick someone's ass.

11:12.934 --> 11:15.470
That can be arranged.

11:21.910 --> 11:24.145
Jesus Christ!

11:24.179 --> 11:27.115
Right initials, wrong fella. Robert,

11:27.148 --> 11:29.584
- you don't want to do this.
- Oh, but I do.

11:29.617 --> 11:31.753
I must be close to actually doing it

11:31.786 --> 11:34.189
for you to be here. Let me ask you,

11:34.222 --> 11:36.191
why negotiate with a demon

11:36.224 --> 11:38.159
instead of pleading with the human?

11:38.193 --> 11:40.161
She's too far gone.

11:40.195 --> 11:42.997
- Whatever Willa once was...
- She's so much more.

11:43.031 --> 11:45.600
Besides,

11:45.633 --> 11:48.803
what are you gonna do
about it? Tell on me?

11:49.871 --> 11:52.073
If the heir

11:52.106 --> 11:54.776
crosses the boundary

11:54.809 --> 11:57.779
with Peacemaker on this
day with hate in her heart,

11:57.812 --> 12:00.315
there won't be anybody left to tell.

12:00.348 --> 12:03.651
You know why Willa and I fell in love?

12:03.685 --> 12:06.521
- Slim pickings at the hostage hut?
- No.

12:06.554 --> 12:08.857
Because the Earp curse's
brought us both nothing but pain.

12:08.890 --> 12:10.792
You brought your pain on yourself.

12:10.825 --> 12:12.794
You have no right to be
here. You're not allowed

12:12.827 --> 12:14.896
to interfere, remember?

12:14.929 --> 12:17.098
So step aside, old man.

12:21.903 --> 12:24.339
I can save her.

12:24.372 --> 12:27.075
If we get out there,

12:27.108 --> 12:29.544
I can save us both.

12:29.577 --> 12:31.546
Save her.

12:40.488 --> 12:42.523
Chrissy, don't make me break

12:42.557 --> 12:44.325
that skinny little neck of yours!

12:44.359 --> 12:46.828
Wynonna.

12:46.861 --> 12:49.864
- God!
- My dad...

12:49.898 --> 12:52.767
Daddy's out there
somewhere. And my friends!

12:52.800 --> 12:54.736
I'm the only one who
can save them, Chrissy.

12:54.769 --> 12:57.605
- Hey!
- OW! Who the hell are you?!

12:57.639 --> 12:59.707
Another Earp.

12:59.741 --> 13:02.410
- Oh, shit.
- Chrissy!

13:02.443 --> 13:04.812
Shit!

13:04.846 --> 13:06.681
Waverly!

13:08.583 --> 13:10.618
Hi. Let's see.

13:10.652 --> 13:12.420
Ah!

13:12.453 --> 13:14.088
- There.
- You came.

13:14.122 --> 13:16.925
Of course.

13:16.958 --> 13:19.460
- Is Chrissy... Is... Argh!
- OK.

13:19.494 --> 13:22.363
- Is Chrissy OK?
- Shake it off, sis. We have

13:22.397 --> 13:24.699
- to get back to the Wainwright.
- What? What? Why?

13:24.732 --> 13:26.634
We have to find Peacemaker.

13:37.412 --> 13:39.414
You took it from me?

13:41.049 --> 13:42.383
You?

13:42.417 --> 13:44.185
Wynonna!

13:49.090 --> 13:51.292
You OK, baby girl?

13:51.326 --> 13:52.460
OK then.

14:00.802 --> 14:03.504
I think Waverly ingested the poison.

14:03.538 --> 14:06.107
- Did not!
- She's acting erratically.

14:06.140 --> 14:08.810
Because I took Peacemaker away from you?

14:08.843 --> 14:10.845
- Why?
- I saw something

14:10.878 --> 14:13.247
in Willa's eyes at the
place where Bobo held her.

14:13.281 --> 14:15.783
- What are you saying?
- I don't think

14:15.817 --> 14:18.386
the Willa that came back is our Willa.

14:18.419 --> 14:20.621
What I am is the goddamn

14:20.655 --> 14:23.291
Earp heir, and I'm running
out of goddamn time!

14:23.324 --> 14:25.760
I don't want anyone to get hurt.

14:25.793 --> 14:27.289
Nobody's getting hurt on my watch.

14:27.425 --> 14:29.797
Nobody else, you mean. Daddy, me,

14:29.831 --> 14:32.266
everyone else out there. When are you

14:32.300 --> 14:34.869
gonna take responsibility
for all that you've done?!

14:36.404 --> 14:38.339
Why did Bobo save you

14:38.373 --> 14:42.076
at the homestead? Why did you save him?

14:44.479 --> 14:46.314
Hey, I knew I recognized that ringtone.

14:46.347 --> 14:48.516
Whoa!

14:48.549 --> 14:49.650
OK. OK.

14:49.684 --> 14:51.953
Give me Peacemaker or I punch

14:51.986 --> 14:54.155
a bunch of holes in
Waverly's girlfriend.

14:54.188 --> 14:55.656
"Girlfriend"?

14:55.690 --> 14:58.259
- Um, kind of.
- Kind of?

14:58.292 --> 15:00.995
- I know you won't shoot.
- What do I care

15:01.029 --> 15:03.865
- about some ginger butch cop?
- Wynonna, she'll do it.

15:03.898 --> 15:06.100
- Waverly...
- If I don't have it in three.

15:06.134 --> 15:08.803
- No, please!
- It's the only thing that'll stop Bobo.

15:08.836 --> 15:10.171
Two.

15:10.204 --> 15:11.472
- Wynonna.
- I can't.

15:11.506 --> 15:14.375
Please. I love her.

15:15.476 --> 15:17.578
One.

15:19.013 --> 15:21.182
OK. OK!

15:28.623 --> 15:31.893
So naive, so emotional.

15:31.926 --> 15:34.395
This isn't over.

15:34.429 --> 15:36.297
I'm coming for you.

15:36.330 --> 15:39.133
Then I better slow you down.

15:40.601 --> 15:42.837
- Ah!
- Now you know

15:42.870 --> 15:45.706
what it feels like when
people take your things.

15:51.328 --> 15:52.504
- Come here.
- I want...

15:52.529 --> 15:54.398
I know, I know.

15:54.431 --> 15:56.633
No blood.

15:56.667 --> 15:59.202
- There's no blood!
- Shh-shh.

15:59.236 --> 16:01.271
If my sister joined the dark side,

16:01.304 --> 16:03.173
and you've been a
revenant this whole time,

16:03.206 --> 16:05.308
I'm just gonna call in sick tomorrow.

16:05.342 --> 16:07.444
No, I'm...

16:07.477 --> 16:09.279
wearing a bulletproof vest.

16:09.312 --> 16:12.482
It's kind of standard
operating procedure

16:12.516 --> 16:14.818
when we got a 404 on our hands.

16:16.486 --> 16:18.622
Bunch of crazy hicks off their rockers?

16:18.655 --> 16:20.729
Finally picked the smart one.

16:24.027 --> 16:25.962
I'm gonna get you to the hospital, OK?

16:25.996 --> 16:27.998
No, no. I'm just a little bit bruised.

16:28.031 --> 16:30.701
You gotta go with Wynonna
and stop your sister.

16:30.734 --> 16:32.703
Sorry, but she's kind of a dickhead.

16:32.736 --> 16:34.805
Wish Doc and Dolls were here.

16:34.838 --> 16:36.606
They went to raid Shorty's.

16:36.640 --> 16:38.675
Something about an antidote.

16:38.709 --> 16:41.244
See? Super smart.

16:43.880 --> 16:46.850
Yeah, alright. Yeah, you guys do that.

16:48.785 --> 16:50.654
Time's up, let's go!

16:50.687 --> 16:53.223
Go.

16:54.991 --> 16:57.994
- Bobo did something to her.
- She shot my girlfriend!

16:58.028 --> 17:00.197
Now, if we can just undo
it, we can get her back.

17:00.230 --> 17:04.334
- The real her.
- I'm not scared of Willa.

17:04.367 --> 17:05.935
Wynonna Earp!

17:05.969 --> 17:09.071
Well, well, well,

17:09.106 --> 17:12.108
the lady herself. Dead
or alive, I think he said.

17:12.142 --> 17:14.044
Oh, right. You guys.

17:14.077 --> 17:15.650
Come on! You sure you don't want to

17:15.675 --> 17:17.180
bring something more substantial?

17:17.214 --> 17:20.383
You don't go to war with a borrowed gun.

17:24.087 --> 17:26.790
- Guarding something for Bobo?
- I think they think

17:26.823 --> 17:28.825
they are while he gets away scot-free.

17:28.859 --> 17:31.795
Holliday and Black Badge. Get 'em, boys!

17:31.828 --> 17:34.765
Yes, let us not stand
on ceremony. Heehaw!

17:35.866 --> 17:38.869
Ah! Shorty's.

17:41.571 --> 17:43.540
Let Waverly go, and you can have me.

17:43.573 --> 17:46.676
- That sounds like a plan.
- Nedley. You seem

17:46.710 --> 17:49.012
sweatier than usual. It's
really saying something.

17:49.045 --> 17:51.882
This is quite the pickle you
got yourself into, Wynonna.

17:51.915 --> 17:53.717
You know me.

17:53.750 --> 17:55.886
You have been a plague on this town,

17:55.919 --> 17:59.189
destroyed a lot of lives

17:59.222 --> 18:01.992
and you were a royal pain in my ass.

18:04.127 --> 18:07.497
She's also the only shot we got

18:07.531 --> 18:09.666
at getting out of this mess.

18:09.699 --> 18:11.935
I know you're sick.

18:11.968 --> 18:14.437
I know that you're scared. So am I.

18:14.471 --> 18:17.574
But that man out there.
Bobo Del Rey and his ilk.

18:17.607 --> 18:19.843
They're not like us.
They've never been like us.

18:22.179 --> 18:24.114
If we do this...

18:24.147 --> 18:26.783
I mean, if we turn into

18:26.817 --> 18:28.919
the angry mob of ignorant villagers

18:28.952 --> 18:31.021
that he thinks we are,

18:31.054 --> 18:34.090
if we kill one of our
own... and make no mistake,

18:34.124 --> 18:36.560
Wynonna is what we made her...

18:36.593 --> 18:39.462
if we do that, then

18:39.496 --> 18:41.798
well, yeah, we'll be just like them.

18:46.036 --> 18:49.072
Hell, we'll be worse
because we had a choice.

18:49.105 --> 18:52.275
So that's it? You're
just gonna let her go?

18:52.309 --> 18:54.277
: No way!

18:54.311 --> 18:57.147
Leave the rest of us
to die a painful death?!

18:57.180 --> 18:59.249
No one's gonna die, Moira.

18:59.282 --> 19:02.185
Wynonna's not gonna let that happen.

19:02.219 --> 19:03.386
Right?

19:04.821 --> 19:06.625
Go. Fix this.

19:17.667 --> 19:20.804
Nedley, you sure you're OK?

19:20.837 --> 19:23.740
Ah, you remember that chili
cookout debacle in '05?

19:23.773 --> 19:25.775
This ain't nothing.

19:25.809 --> 19:28.745
Chrissy's in your office. She's alive.

19:28.778 --> 19:31.648
Thank you for that.

19:32.983 --> 19:34.651
Come on!

19:34.684 --> 19:36.653
Think we got 'em all? Ugh!

19:59.643 --> 20:01.945
I had a horse named Lavender once.

20:14.557 --> 20:16.826
Ah!

20:16.860 --> 20:19.162
Ugh! Ah...

20:19.195 --> 20:21.998
You pocketed my drugs. Argh!

20:22.032 --> 20:23.767
I brought your drugs.

20:23.800 --> 20:25.869
You are the laziest junkie I ever met.

20:34.377 --> 20:36.479
How much did you use?

20:37.681 --> 20:40.150
Argh! Ugh!

20:40.183 --> 20:42.118
Aaah!

20:42.152 --> 20:45.388
Which ones did you use?

20:45.422 --> 20:48.091
Are you sure you're up for this?

20:57.934 --> 20:59.970
You might want to stand back.

21:03.473 --> 21:05.642
Playtime's over.

21:10.814 --> 21:13.616
Aaah!

21:13.650 --> 21:16.753
- What are you?
- Aaaaaah!

21:16.786 --> 21:20.156
I guess I'm about to find out.

21:22.926 --> 21:24.407
Must be the end of the world 'cause I

21:24.432 --> 21:25.950
think I want to marry Sheriff Nedley.

21:27.797 --> 21:30.834
OK, uh... you need to
go find Doc and Dolls.

21:30.867 --> 21:33.570
And I've got something I need to do.

21:35.171 --> 21:37.140
Something only I can do.

21:53.423 --> 21:55.291
What the hell?

22:02.966 --> 22:06.369
OK, so Black Badge is gonna test
this stuff ASAP, then I'm gonna try

22:06.403 --> 22:09.239
manufacture a cure or... Oh, hey.

22:09.272 --> 22:11.808
- Hey.
- Pass this stuff out

22:11.841 --> 22:13.443
to everyone in the town.

22:13.476 --> 22:15.345
You should have seen your boy

22:15.378 --> 22:17.814
- shoot earlier. Not bad.
- Me?

22:17.847 --> 22:19.949
This one tossed big
Steve through the window.

22:21.651 --> 22:23.486
As long as you boys had fun.

22:23.520 --> 22:26.189
Look, Bobo had all these
revenants squirreled up in here,

22:26.222 --> 22:29.192
guarding the poison.
Probably to keep 'em busy

22:29.225 --> 22:31.261
while he escapes the
Ghost River Triangle.

22:31.294 --> 22:34.030
Well, he'll have help.

22:35.598 --> 22:37.934
Willa's a double agent.

22:37.967 --> 22:40.336
- They're in this together.
- What?!

22:40.370 --> 22:42.906
- They'll try to cross the line.
- The Solstice.

22:42.939 --> 22:44.841
And they've got my gun.

22:44.874 --> 22:46.709
Her gun.

22:49.045 --> 22:51.481
Hey, are you shot?

22:51.514 --> 22:53.550
Hey, whoa, whoa, don't touch me.

22:53.583 --> 22:55.185
I'm-I'm still your boss.

22:55.218 --> 22:57.454
And I had to call mine in.

22:57.487 --> 22:59.856
Lucado's coming here?

22:59.889 --> 23:03.193
- Desperate times.
- Bobo.

23:03.226 --> 23:05.862
Bobo's coming back for us.

23:05.895 --> 23:07.831
And he's playing the lead.

23:07.864 --> 23:10.467
Try. Your friend's flown
the coop without you.

23:11.434 --> 23:13.603
Stupid Carl.

23:13.636 --> 23:15.605
What's wrong with him?

23:15.638 --> 23:18.041
We need to head your
sister off at the pass.

23:18.074 --> 23:20.009
I still got to
coordinate the quarantine.

23:20.043 --> 23:22.545
- Please come.
- Two on two.

23:22.579 --> 23:25.381
One of whom is one of
the fastest gunslingers

23:25.415 --> 23:27.951
in the West. And the other...

23:30.553 --> 23:33.156
Permission to re-raid your gun safe?

23:33.189 --> 23:35.859
80-62-88. Hey, Earp,

23:35.892 --> 23:37.927
good luck.

23:44.701 --> 23:47.003
Willa?

23:47.036 --> 23:49.772
Wrong sister.

23:54.424 --> 23:55.504
Did you drink the poison?

23:55.959 --> 23:58.061
Come here to beg

23:58.095 --> 24:00.063
me for the antidote?

24:00.097 --> 24:01.832
I just want answers.

24:01.865 --> 24:05.068
- Oh?
- Robert Svane.

24:05.102 --> 24:06.603
Svane,

24:06.637 --> 24:08.438
Norwegian for swan.

24:08.472 --> 24:11.508
You never cease to impress me, Waverly.

24:11.541 --> 24:14.511
And look at you now.

24:15.679 --> 24:17.681
All grown up.

24:17.714 --> 24:20.117
- Where's Willa?
- Your sister's not here.

24:20.150 --> 24:23.053
But she's coming, isn't she?

24:23.086 --> 24:25.322
She's your lead.

24:25.355 --> 24:26.857
Bingo.

24:26.890 --> 24:29.793
The thing is, if you open that door,

24:29.826 --> 24:32.529
you're not the only
thing that can leave.

24:32.562 --> 24:34.498
All the other revenants will flee.

24:34.531 --> 24:36.633
You're letting... you're
letting filthy demons

24:36.667 --> 24:39.670
- loose into this world!
- I am one of those demons.

24:39.703 --> 24:42.339
- Oh, I know.
- They're not the only ones

24:42.372 --> 24:44.641
who'll be set free.

24:44.675 --> 24:46.810
Wyatt Earp's has been
dead and in the dark

24:46.843 --> 24:48.845
for 80 years. Maybe it's time

24:48.879 --> 24:50.814
for the rest of us to
step into the light.

24:50.847 --> 24:52.716
Including you.

24:54.117 --> 24:56.953
Is this how you did it with Willa?

24:56.987 --> 24:59.489
Talked and coerced

24:59.523 --> 25:02.659
and seduced a 13-year-old girl?

25:02.693 --> 25:04.995
I never lay a finger on her.

25:05.028 --> 25:06.997
You were her captor!

25:07.030 --> 25:09.733
I was her saviour! Those
other revenants wanted

25:09.766 --> 25:11.268
to do horrible things to her.

25:11.301 --> 25:13.503
I told them I killed her.

25:13.537 --> 25:15.639
I hid her away.

25:15.672 --> 25:18.542
Here.

25:23.113 --> 25:26.450
Sounds like one sick fairy tale.

25:26.483 --> 25:28.719
It wasn't always like this.

25:28.752 --> 25:30.354
After Clootie stole her

25:30.387 --> 25:32.222
away from me,

25:32.255 --> 25:34.725
I did go

25:34.758 --> 25:36.693
a little crazy.

25:36.727 --> 25:39.830
But days before she was due to turn 27,

25:39.863 --> 25:42.332
Constance erases her memory...

25:44.301 --> 25:46.636
and says

25:46.670 --> 25:49.072
she will only give me back Willa

25:49.106 --> 25:51.375
if I help her put
back together her boys.

25:51.408 --> 25:53.110
The bones.

25:53.143 --> 25:55.011
I rallied an army together

25:55.045 --> 25:58.081
to dig in the dirt.

25:58.115 --> 26:00.684
And I dug,

26:00.717 --> 26:03.353
and I dug, and I dug.

26:04.955 --> 26:07.691
Do you know why?

26:15.665 --> 26:18.602
Swans mate for life.

26:18.635 --> 26:21.638
Please.

26:21.671 --> 26:24.141
Please, let her go.

26:24.174 --> 26:26.977
Have you been listening to me?

26:28.278 --> 26:31.214
I used to watch you girls,

26:31.248 --> 26:34.317
and I'd wonder how a man

26:34.351 --> 26:37.521
like Ward Earp ended up
with so much goodness.

26:38.522 --> 26:40.290
And then there was the baby.

26:40.323 --> 26:43.527
And I used to think
about saving her too.

26:44.861 --> 26:47.164
Only I wasn't the heir.

26:47.197 --> 26:49.866
Ohhh,

26:49.900 --> 26:51.902
Waverly.

26:57.240 --> 26:59.176
You're not even an Earp.

26:59.209 --> 27:01.411
Robert?

27:03.447 --> 27:04.948
You need to hide.

27:04.981 --> 27:07.384
Now. Get behind that bed.

27:10.887 --> 27:14.024
Hey.

27:15.759 --> 27:17.828
- I got it.
- Yeah?

27:17.861 --> 27:19.796
Little snitch Waverly took it.

27:19.830 --> 27:21.631
We have to go, now.

27:21.665 --> 27:23.400
Come on.

27:30.640 --> 27:32.642
Come on, Doc, spit it out.

27:32.676 --> 27:34.978
- Spit what out?
- You know,

27:35.011 --> 27:37.581
the rousing old-timey speech
that's gonna make me believe

27:37.614 --> 27:39.616
I can take on my own sister.

27:39.649 --> 27:42.052
Come on. WWWD.

27:43.253 --> 27:44.888
What Would Wyatt Do?

27:47.357 --> 27:49.893
I once had a dog the name of Plucky.

27:49.926 --> 27:52.996
Your big pep talk is "Plucky"?

27:53.029 --> 27:55.165
She was a gorgeous
black and tan coonhound,

27:55.198 --> 27:57.133
but she only had one ear.

27:57.167 --> 27:59.369
Even so, she would run from miles

27:59.402 --> 28:01.338
when she heard me calling.

28:01.371 --> 28:05.175
She got bit by something in
the woods, and she went rabid.

28:05.208 --> 28:07.244
Wyatt, he offered

28:07.277 --> 28:09.846
to put her down, but

28:09.880 --> 28:11.915
I knew it had to be me.

28:13.717 --> 28:16.019
Old Yeller might owe you some royalties.

28:16.052 --> 28:18.889
I am sorry about your sister.

28:18.922 --> 28:21.291
I never was a great judge of character.

28:21.738 --> 28:23.941
Always ended up dating the drummer.

28:23.966 --> 28:26.035
I mean we could run.

28:27.597 --> 28:29.766
We could get a little
house in the country,

28:29.799 --> 28:32.135
raise chickens, grow barley.

28:32.168 --> 28:34.271
Is that why you came back?

28:34.304 --> 28:36.306
To be a farmer?

28:37.474 --> 28:40.243
No, I returned because a peculiar fellow

28:40.277 --> 28:42.212
insisted you needed my help.

28:42.245 --> 28:44.648
Was he a farmer?

28:44.681 --> 28:46.650
He was a mechanic.

28:48.752 --> 28:51.221
Willa's got Peacemaker.

28:51.254 --> 28:53.957
Bobo's got telekinetic powers.

28:53.990 --> 28:55.458
What do we got?

28:55.492 --> 28:57.861
Things that go boom.

29:00.030 --> 29:01.731
She's better than me, Doc.

29:01.765 --> 29:03.967
Faster.

29:05.001 --> 29:06.770
I don't think I can beat her.

29:06.803 --> 29:09.906
But you are still gonna try.

29:09.940 --> 29:12.943
- I have to.
- Careful, Earp.

29:12.976 --> 29:14.978
Doing what's right

29:15.011 --> 29:17.747
even in the face of ridiculous odds?

29:17.781 --> 29:20.750
You are beginning to sound like a hero.

29:22.452 --> 29:26.423
No matter what happens, Willa

29:26.456 --> 29:28.925
is not a dog.

29:28.959 --> 29:31.127
I'm not putting her down.

29:31.161 --> 29:34.164
Let's hope she still comes

29:34.197 --> 29:36.333
when you call.

29:39.469 --> 29:40.670
Ah...

29:40.704 --> 29:43.673
R&D approximates 36 hours

29:43.707 --> 29:46.109
until an antidote.

29:46.142 --> 29:48.111
Meanwhile, we're monitoring
and have handed out

29:48.144 --> 29:49.913
antipsychotics to about

29:49.946 --> 29:52.949
- 80% of the town.
- In every report you've filed

29:52.983 --> 29:56.519
you didn't once think to mention
there could be two Earp heirs?

29:56.553 --> 29:58.488
- I didn't know for sure.
- Black Badge

29:58.521 --> 30:01.758
has underestimated the situation
here, I'll give you that.

30:01.791 --> 30:04.327
If we survive this, expect us to start

30:04.361 --> 30:06.888
- being a little more hands on.
- From day one, I've been

30:06.889 --> 30:08.658
following my orders, to
make sure the revenants

30:08.683 --> 30:10.133
do not leave the Ghost River Triangle.

30:10.166 --> 30:12.102
We have new orders.

30:12.135 --> 30:14.137
If this Bobo Del Rey can open a gateway,

30:14.170 --> 30:16.106
we observe what happens when he does.

30:16.139 --> 30:18.875
And what happens next is
that people die. My people,

30:18.908 --> 30:20.810
anyone else these demons
come into contact with.

30:20.844 --> 30:23.446
There are other forces at play here.

30:23.480 --> 30:25.582
We are not to interfere.
If you can't handle that,

30:25.615 --> 30:27.550
- turn in your badge.
- Lucado,

30:27.584 --> 30:30.687
I need to assist my deputy.

30:30.720 --> 30:32.656
If you step within 50
yards of the boundary,

30:32.689 --> 30:34.557
I'll have you arrested for treason.

30:35.797 --> 30:37.360
What is it?

30:37.394 --> 30:40.797
What is it exactly that
you have against me?

30:45.902 --> 30:48.905
That you survived Kandahar

30:48.938 --> 30:51.341
when...

30:51.374 --> 30:53.376
others didn't.

30:55.879 --> 30:58.481
You are a monster.

30:59.983 --> 31:02.485
In more ways than one.

31:02.519 --> 31:04.220
I'd say to make

31:04.254 --> 31:06.556
yourself useful, but it's
pretty obvious you can't.

31:11.227 --> 31:13.096
Willa!

31:14.597 --> 31:16.599
I'll take care of these mice.

31:16.633 --> 31:19.002
- OK.
- Go.

31:42.459 --> 31:43.993
Hey!

31:44.027 --> 31:46.029
Wanna play with the big girls?

31:52.802 --> 31:54.370
Run!

32:09.619 --> 32:11.221
Doc!

32:11.254 --> 32:14.190
Doc! Doc!

32:17.994 --> 32:19.662
It's OK, love.

32:19.696 --> 32:21.297
Go on.

32:24.100 --> 32:25.969
Willa.

32:31.908 --> 32:33.643
Respect your elders, bitch!

32:33.676 --> 32:36.479
Wake up and remember
who the hell you are!

32:36.513 --> 32:39.783
- You're Willa Earp!
- And the rightful heir!

32:39.816 --> 32:42.485
Then you should know that what
you're doing is hella dumb!

32:42.519 --> 32:44.120
No! Wait! Willa!

32:44.154 --> 32:46.055
I'm serious, stop!

32:54.531 --> 32:56.432
What did you do?

32:56.466 --> 32:58.768
What I had to!

33:04.974 --> 33:07.343
OK, so what the hell was that?

33:14.150 --> 33:16.385
I did it!

33:16.386 --> 33:18.555
I am the lead! Hahaha!

33:18.588 --> 33:20.824
The prison gates are open!

33:26.029 --> 33:27.897
Willa, we can still stop this.

33:27.931 --> 33:30.099
Stop this?!

33:30.133 --> 33:32.335
This is better than I planned.

33:32.368 --> 33:34.370
Bobo and I get out,

33:34.404 --> 33:36.072
and Purgatory burns!

33:36.105 --> 33:38.241
They hate us, Wynonna.

33:38.274 --> 33:40.610
They're evil. They deserve that thing!

33:44.581 --> 33:46.883
I doubt your lover's gonna make it.

33:46.916 --> 33:50.253
- So, I go it alone.
- No, you're not alone. You have me.

33:53.861 --> 33:57.165
Willa, either make it
stop or I'll stop you.

33:57.198 --> 34:00.501
Wilaaa!

34:00.535 --> 34:02.170
Funny, that it would go down here.

34:02.203 --> 34:04.472
Mom used to bring us here.

34:04.505 --> 34:07.442
When she couldn't take
any more of Dad's fists.

34:18.886 --> 34:21.155
We have to get Peacemaker
back over the line,

34:21.188 --> 34:24.125
and then we can start
over. Just you and me.

34:24.158 --> 34:26.460
Bobo doesn't know,

34:26.494 --> 34:28.463
but he's not the only
one that came to visit me

34:28.496 --> 34:30.465
in that treehouse

34:30.498 --> 34:32.567
making promises in the dark.

34:32.600 --> 34:35.536
What kind of promises?

34:35.570 --> 34:38.739
That death can be a mercy.

34:38.773 --> 34:40.541
I know you don't believe me,

34:40.574 --> 34:43.578
but I'm doing this for you.

34:43.610 --> 34:46.581
No more Purgatory, no more Earps,

34:46.614 --> 34:48.748
no more curse.

34:56.056 --> 34:58.926
- Not me.
- Well, who then?

34:58.960 --> 35:02.330
The old one.

35:04.398 --> 35:06.934
I'm faster than you.

35:06.968 --> 35:09.203
You're my sister.

35:09.237 --> 35:10.605
I promise this will be quick.

35:10.638 --> 35:13.407
- You know you can't.
- You keep saying that.

35:20.047 --> 35:21.816
Squeak.

35:27.755 --> 35:30.758
Willa.

35:30.791 --> 35:33.961
- What happened?
- You went wrong.

35:40.801 --> 35:43.304
Did you get a clean shot?

35:43.337 --> 35:45.339
That wasn't a clean shot.

35:52.880 --> 35:54.181
See, Wynonna?

35:55.683 --> 35:59.120
You can never really go home again.

36:07.795 --> 36:10.831
Wynonna!

36:20.841 --> 36:23.144
Make your peace.

37:29.286 --> 37:30.625
Do it.

37:32.327 --> 37:34.596
Do it.

37:34.629 --> 37:36.698
I'm already in hell.

37:36.731 --> 37:39.334
Did you love her, Robert?

37:39.367 --> 37:41.503
Did you?

37:41.536 --> 37:44.305
We'll take it from here, Deputy.

37:44.339 --> 37:46.392
- What are you...?
- Taking him to a black site.

37:47.233 --> 37:49.663
- Extraordinary rendition.
- Outside of the Triangle?

37:49.826 --> 37:52.947
Wynonna! Don't let them do this!

37:52.981 --> 37:54.386
Please! Shoot me!

37:54.549 --> 37:56.496
- Shoot!
- I can't end the curse

37:56.497 --> 37:58.501
unless I send every single
revenant back to Hell!

37:58.529 --> 38:01.732
Be nice, and in a few months,
we might send him back to you.

38:01.766 --> 38:04.869
You can dispatch whatever is
left of his quivering mass.

38:07.371 --> 38:09.707
- Dolls?
- He defied

38:09.740 --> 38:12.410
a direct order from his
superiors. That's treason.

38:12.443 --> 38:15.646
- He's a good man.
- He's a good liar.

38:15.680 --> 38:18.316
You don't give a shit what he did.

38:18.349 --> 38:20.351
This is personal for you.

38:20.384 --> 38:22.086
Hahaha!

38:22.119 --> 38:24.221
You are in no position to interfere.

38:24.255 --> 38:26.424
What with your history.

38:26.457 --> 38:28.893
The Bleaker case? So I pulled

38:28.926 --> 38:31.529
- a few B&Es in the day.
- No, Wynonna.

38:31.562 --> 38:34.398
We know what you did.

38:41.439 --> 38:44.008
Did you get the town coordinates?

38:44.041 --> 38:46.477
When we're out of range,
tell control to go in hot.

38:46.510 --> 38:48.612
Tomahawks, the whole she-bang.

38:52.316 --> 38:54.919
Boom.

39:06.163 --> 39:08.566
You did aces, Wynonna.

39:08.599 --> 39:11.535
Careful now. We all know how good

39:11.569 --> 39:14.071
- you are with that thing.
- Who are you?

39:14.138 --> 39:16.440
No revenant. See?

39:17.641 --> 39:19.910
I'm outside the Ghost River Triangle.

39:19.944 --> 39:21.979
There are things out there, too.

39:22.013 --> 39:24.148
Things that want to get in.

39:24.181 --> 39:26.484
- Why?
- The Triangle is not only

39:26.517 --> 39:29.720
a prison. It's also a sanctuary.

39:31.455 --> 39:33.324
- For who?
- Not a who.

39:33.357 --> 39:35.426
A what.

39:38.796 --> 39:41.298
Listen.

39:41.332 --> 39:43.701
You know who I am?

39:43.734 --> 39:45.870
I'm the goddamn Earp heir.

39:45.903 --> 39:47.872
I got work to do.

39:47.905 --> 39:49.874
Good luck, Wynonna.

39:49.907 --> 39:52.309
We'll be watching you.

39:53.444 --> 39:54.945
Super.

40:02.119 --> 40:04.422
What did you do?

40:12.496 --> 40:15.066
We're almost over the line now.

40:23.441 --> 40:25.843
This one's gonna hurt.

41:20.931 --> 41:22.967
We all used to play here

41:23.000 --> 41:25.336
under a poplar tree.

41:25.369 --> 41:28.172
The year she was taken,
it got felled by lightning.

41:28.205 --> 41:31.075
Spring comes, I'm gonna plant a new one.

41:31.108 --> 41:34.044
For the girl she was.

41:34.078 --> 41:36.013
For my Willa.

41:36.046 --> 41:38.149
Well, that'll be lovely.

41:38.182 --> 41:40.117
But first, I'm gonna kill

41:40.151 --> 41:42.153
every single revenant from the Rockies

41:42.186 --> 41:44.155
to the big city.

41:44.188 --> 41:46.524
And then I'm gonna stop that
thing from getting in here.

41:46.557 --> 41:48.492
And the deputy marshal?

41:48.526 --> 41:51.829
Are we gonna go get him?

41:51.862 --> 41:54.965
He's in a maximum
security black ops prison,

41:54.999 --> 41:56.867
and he shot my sister.

41:58.135 --> 42:00.538
Damn straight we're gonna go get him.

42:14.418 --> 42:16.820
What do you think that is?

42:16.854 --> 42:18.722
I don't know yet.

42:18.756 --> 42:20.658
Well, it's coming.

42:20.691 --> 42:22.693
Mm-hmm.

42:22.726 --> 42:24.795
So am I.

42:30.201 --> 42:33.070
- You ready?
- Sweetheart,

42:33.103 --> 42:35.039
I'm ready for anything.
