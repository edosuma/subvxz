WEBVTT

00:10.000 --> 00:13.080
It's a hive mind.
The knowledge transmits.

00:13.120 --> 00:16.720
She wanted to hurt me.
I think she sees me as a threat.

00:16.760 --> 00:20.480
See that boy? That's just 30 grand
a year tax-free from the government.

00:20.520 --> 00:23.800
Zoe, I'm taking your advice.
We're leaving.

00:23.840 --> 00:26.320
Mummy doesn't love me any more.

00:26.360 --> 00:29.840
Of course she does.
No. Only you do.

00:29.880 --> 00:31.960
Sunny. Please.

00:45.200 --> 00:49.400
# Who would true valour see

00:49.440 --> 00:53.920
# Let him come hither...

00:53.960 --> 00:57.440
The world is constantly changing.
Species develop.

00:57.480 --> 01:00.280
Colonies need terrain.
Taking advantage of...

01:00.320 --> 01:03.640
Entire forests
and even animal life...

01:03.680 --> 01:07.320
# There's no discouragement

01:07.360 --> 01:11.360
# Shall make him once relent

01:11.400 --> 01:14.600
# His first avowed intent

01:14.640 --> 01:18.560
# To be a pilgrim

01:18.600 --> 01:23.800
# Who so beset him round...

01:23.840 --> 01:26.600
The more rapidly the planet changes,
the harder it is

01:26.640 --> 01:29.440
for evolution to keep pace.
This process of natural selection...

01:29.480 --> 01:32.280
They secretly lay their
eggs in other birds' nests.

01:32.320 --> 01:34.440
In rivers, jungles and deserts...

01:34.480 --> 01:38.480
Until a new lifeform
arrives and takes its place.

01:38.520 --> 01:40.720
# He will have a right

01:40.760 --> 01:44.560
# To be a pilgrim. #

02:03.160 --> 02:08.280
Mummy has gone.
I don't know where she went.

02:08.320 --> 02:12.480
She drove me to the house.
She said I would be happier here.

02:12.520 --> 02:16.120
She kept crying.
She made me feel sad.

02:16.160 --> 02:18.800
I didn't want her to leave.

02:18.840 --> 02:21.600
I told her but she didn't listen.

02:25.880 --> 02:27.720
So, we have them here.

02:27.760 --> 02:33.360
But then, it cuts out and it stays
like that for nearly six hours.

02:34.680 --> 02:38.840
We searched all the vehicles,
the hotel. Nothing.

02:38.880 --> 02:42.200
She hasn't contacted any
of her friends or family since.

02:42.240 --> 02:44.680
And look at this.

02:44.720 --> 02:47.680
The journey from
the hotel to the house.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.200
Every camera goes out
for exactly 30 seconds.

02:53.880 --> 02:55.960
What do the mothers know?

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Just that she left.

02:59.920 --> 03:02.080
Let's keep it that way.

03:02.120 --> 03:04.360
I just can't get my head around it.

03:04.400 --> 03:06.440
Joe's my loving little boy.

03:06.480 --> 03:11.560
How can he be the same
as Lily-Grace or Evie?

03:11.600 --> 03:14.640
They're not saying they're
the same. What are you saying?

03:14.680 --> 03:17.920
We're still trying to
work out how their mind works.

03:17.960 --> 03:21.560
But say Joe learns
something at school,

03:21.600 --> 03:26.320
or about me, about Curtis,
then the others will know it, yes?

03:26.360 --> 03:29.000
They'll know all your
dirty secrets, Rach.

03:29.040 --> 03:32.880
It's not funny.
Maybe it's time

03:32.920 --> 03:37.080
that we accept the children
for what they actually are.

03:37.120 --> 03:39.120
Which is?

03:40.120 --> 03:43.120
An evolutionary step forward.

03:43.160 --> 03:46.880
These children have come from us,
they're the next development.

03:46.920 --> 03:51.320
If they're one being, then why
do they need different parents?

03:51.360 --> 03:54.880
Why are we making
the sacrifices we've made?

03:54.920 --> 03:57.680
Cutting off from family,
seeing no friends.

03:57.720 --> 04:01.640
Because they need us. Do they?
They're not just a brain, Jane.

04:01.680 --> 04:04.760
Lily-Grace is herself.
Connor is himself.

04:04.800 --> 04:06.800
How do you know?
How can you be sure?

04:06.840 --> 04:09.920
This doesn't need to divide us.
If they can live

04:09.960 --> 04:12.240
as one harmonious being,
then why can't we?

04:12.280 --> 04:14.520
We should take a leaf
out of their book.

04:14.560 --> 04:17.000
It could actually
bring us all closer.

04:17.040 --> 04:19.760
Sure. I'd agree.

04:19.800 --> 04:21.800
Mm! Me too.

04:21.840 --> 04:25.000
That sounds great, Cassie.
But my house is divided.

04:25.040 --> 04:28.440
I have a husband who loves
one son and hates the other.

04:28.480 --> 04:31.880
You think that's weird.
The daughter of my husband's lover

04:31.920 --> 04:33.920
thinks I'm her mother.

04:40.400 --> 04:43.840
Because she knew you'd be
a better mother right? You think?

04:43.880 --> 04:49.160
Well, why else? Sunny wanted
a loving parent. They all do.

04:49.200 --> 04:52.000
I know that Evie is mine.

04:52.040 --> 04:55.200
I just... I know.

05:02.720 --> 05:05.760
Have fun.
See you later. Bye.

05:11.200 --> 05:15.560
That was a good session, Dr Zellaby.
You spoke beautifully.

05:15.600 --> 05:18.280
Well, it runs in my genes.

05:21.720 --> 05:23.800
What's wrong?

05:23.840 --> 05:26.880
Amrita Chohhan. They, er...

05:26.920 --> 05:30.000
They still can't
work out where she went.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.920
She abandoned her daughter.
That's all I need to know.

05:59.960 --> 06:03.680
She had another bad dream,
she's freezing.

06:03.720 --> 06:06.920
It's every night since Sunny came.
It'll pass.

06:06.960 --> 06:09.960
She should sleep in her own bed.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.800
Did you go to
the group meeting today?

06:13.840 --> 06:16.440
No, I forgot.

06:16.480 --> 06:19.520
I... I thought it might be helpful.

06:19.560 --> 06:23.640
I am not like those women
and I never will be.

06:47.920 --> 06:50.320
Sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.

06:50.360 --> 06:52.960
Oh, it's all right. I wasn't asleep.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.640
Any luck with Amrita?

06:55.680 --> 06:58.280
No. I'm...
I'm sure she'll call soon.

06:59.280 --> 07:01.200
You're worried about her.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.440
Did you go looking
for a place to live?

07:08.000 --> 07:10.880
No, not yet.

07:10.920 --> 07:13.160
Why?

07:13.200 --> 07:16.040
I'm not sure, um...

07:17.280 --> 07:19.200
Well, I just think it'd be better

07:19.240 --> 07:22.600
if Nathan was here
with me at the moment.

07:22.640 --> 07:26.320
Well, if it's Nathan
you're worried about...

07:28.200 --> 07:30.200
Please don't move out.

07:30.240 --> 07:32.240
Not now.

07:34.640 --> 07:36.400
OK.

08:33.640 --> 08:38.640
Steve, get me the hotel CCTV again,
before and after.

08:39.800 --> 08:42.520
What are you looking for?
Something we missed.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.800
Stop.

08:47.920 --> 08:50.880
There. Zoom in on the mirror.

08:53.760 --> 08:55.760
I don't get it.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.800
Look closer.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.800
The vans, they're different.

09:15.520 --> 09:17.640
The night that
the guest disappeared,

09:17.680 --> 09:21.480
there was a...
a white Ford van in the car park.

09:22.520 --> 09:25.840
And there was a different
one there in the morning.

09:25.880 --> 09:28.240
Yes. The morning one that's laundry.
That comes every day.

09:28.280 --> 09:32.000
And the night before?
That would be frozen deliveries.

09:32.040 --> 09:34.520
That's weekly.
Where from?

09:46.960 --> 09:51.560
DCI Paul Haynes. This is DS Mayes.
I'm looking for a van.

09:56.840 --> 09:58.840
Oh, yeah, that's the broken one.

09:58.880 --> 10:01.920
Can you take me to it?
Follow me. Thank you.

10:56.600 --> 11:00.280
She was locked in,
the wiring shorted.

11:00.320 --> 11:03.960
How did it stay that cold?
I don't know.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.880
It's impossible.
Who knows about this?

11:07.920 --> 11:12.400
No-one yet. Can you create
a story for the warehouse staff?

11:12.440 --> 11:14.760
Maybe change the name?

11:16.600 --> 11:19.320
What do we do with her body?
I'll deal with that.

11:19.360 --> 11:21.440
London will want tests in any case.

11:21.480 --> 11:24.000
Don't tell the mothers anything.

11:24.040 --> 11:26.360
And let's keep
Dr Zellaby out of this for now.

11:26.400 --> 11:28.320
She was there with me that night.

11:28.360 --> 11:30.800
Er, I have to tell her.
Tell her what exactly?

11:33.760 --> 11:36.720
I'll call the warehouse,
get our story straight.

11:41.720 --> 11:45.600
A woman has died here, a mother,

11:45.640 --> 11:47.720
you can't expect me to ignore that.

11:47.760 --> 11:50.640
DCI Haynes, I realise you're
just trying to do your job.

11:50.680 --> 11:53.600
But we have been presented
with a gift in this town.

11:55.120 --> 11:57.600
I don't pretend to understand
it any more than you.

11:57.640 --> 12:02.200
But what I do know is
we've had two years of peace.

12:02.240 --> 12:07.640
Families have bonded.
There is love in every household.

12:07.680 --> 12:10.360
One isolated incident,
of which we know nothing,

12:10.400 --> 12:14.320
can't be allowed to unravel
all the good we've done.

12:20.280 --> 12:22.280
Thank you.
Sir.

12:23.360 --> 12:25.360
Are you sure about this?

12:25.400 --> 12:28.960
After 20 years in this job,
I'm not sure of anything.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.320
But I have my orders.
Protect the asset.

12:37.840 --> 12:41.520
We're servants of the state, Bryony.
Never forget that.

12:46.520 --> 12:48.520
Bye-bye.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.920
You all right, Nathan? Joe?

12:50.960 --> 12:53.160
We're waiting for our dads.
OK.

12:53.200 --> 12:55.480
Well, I'll be inside
if you need me, yeah

13:24.600 --> 13:27.440
Dad, can I go on the swing, please?

13:27.480 --> 13:30.160
Yeah, course you can. Come on.

13:30.200 --> 13:33.800
Joe, jump off, let your brother
have a go. Then we'll go home.

13:33.840 --> 13:38.440
They're our swings. Yeah, well,
according to government reports,

13:38.480 --> 13:41.080
you're now officially
one person, aren't you?

13:41.120 --> 13:43.160
So you can share one swing.
Dave can have the other

13:43.200 --> 13:44.920
Off!

13:44.960 --> 13:46.920
Come on, boy.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.960
Holding on, yeah?

13:50.200 --> 13:52.200
Hold on.

13:52.240 --> 13:54.520
Joe, look at me.

13:56.280 --> 13:58.640
Easy now, easy now, son. Slow down.

13:58.680 --> 14:02.360
I can't.
Too high! Dad, help!

14:02.400 --> 14:04.040
Take it easy, take it... Oof!

14:04.080 --> 14:05.800
Argh! Argh!

14:05.840 --> 14:07.640
Argh! Aarrgghh!

14:14.800 --> 14:16.640
Hi.
Hi.

14:16.680 --> 14:19.800
I just wanted to follow up on our
previous conversation, if that's OK?

14:19.840 --> 14:21.800
Now's not a good time.

14:21.840 --> 14:26.240
Hi, Hannah.
Mummy, I'm hungry. I should go.

14:26.280 --> 14:28.400
I noticed you weren't
at the meeting yesterday.

14:28.440 --> 14:31.560
Was there a reason?
No reason, I just forgot.

14:32.800 --> 14:35.480
Look, I er... I realise

14:35.520 --> 14:39.720
I may not have been as receptive
as I could have been about...

14:39.760 --> 14:42.240
about what you were
suggesting the last time we spoke.

14:42.280 --> 14:45.280
And I'd really
appreciate the opportunity

14:45.320 --> 14:49.280
to continue the conversation.
I'm shattered.

14:49.320 --> 14:51.680
Hannah's been in
our bed every night, so...

14:51.720 --> 14:54.560
Is she not sleeping well?
No.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.720
Have you been
having bad dreams, Hannah?

14:56.760 --> 14:59.360
No, I haven't.
That's not true.

15:00.680 --> 15:03.160
I haven't had any dreams.

15:14.600 --> 15:17.640
Come on, son. Take your time.
You all right?

15:17.680 --> 15:21.080
Yeah, your mum's here,
go and see her. Oh, baby. Oh, baby!

15:21.120 --> 15:23.440
Just get him inside. I'll talk
to you later. What happened?

15:23.480 --> 15:27.120
Is Joe OK? He's fine, sweetheart,
I'll explain inside. Clean David up.

15:27.160 --> 15:30.880
Is everything OK?
No, everything is not OK.

15:30.920 --> 15:33.080
Curtis, don't be tough on him.
It was just an accident.

15:33.120 --> 15:36.680
An accident? My son is covered in
blood! He could've broken his arm.

15:36.720 --> 15:39.520
They did that. Out!

15:39.560 --> 15:41.920
Well, maybe if I could
just speak to Joe...

15:41.960 --> 15:45.000
Nobody's speaking to him.
This is our business.

15:45.040 --> 15:48.160
Come with me now, sunshine.
I want answers.

15:50.280 --> 15:52.520
Sam, did you see what happened?

15:52.560 --> 15:55.840
David just fell off the swings,
that's all.

15:55.880 --> 15:59.280
And who was there?
Joe and Nathan.

15:59.320 --> 16:01.480
Nathan?
Mm!

16:14.440 --> 16:16.440
Hannah.

16:16.480 --> 16:18.200
Come on.

16:36.520 --> 16:40.440
Zoe, I'm taking your advice.
We're leaving.

16:40.480 --> 16:44.320
Good luck. I'm thinking of you.

16:44.360 --> 16:46.760
If you ever get out of here,
call me.

16:46.800 --> 16:51.000
She says, "We're leaving." So, why
did she leave without her daughter?

16:51.040 --> 16:54.360
Well, why are we doing this now?
She begged me to take her number.

16:54.400 --> 16:56.600
And now, whenever I make contact,
there's no reply.

16:56.640 --> 16:59.040
There could be hundreds of
reasons why she changed her mind.

16:59.080 --> 17:01.880
She said that a man
visited her in London. What man?

17:01.920 --> 17:03.920
Jesus Christ.
Daddy.

17:05.320 --> 17:09.080
No, you stay in your own bed
tonight. Can't sleep, bad dream.

17:09.120 --> 17:11.800
You said you didn't get bad dreams.
Let her come in, she's freezing.

17:11.840 --> 17:14.360
No way. You go back, please. Daddy.
Hannah, get back in your bed.

17:34.480 --> 17:35.680
Argh!

17:35.720 --> 17:39.600
Ohhh! What did you do to me?

17:39.640 --> 17:42.440
Hannah, come with me.

17:42.480 --> 17:44.480
Ohh! Ugh!

17:44.520 --> 17:47.200
Oh!
What the hell is going on?

17:47.240 --> 17:49.800
She's just made me hurt myself.

17:49.840 --> 17:52.520
Look, you're exhausted.
You need sleep.

17:52.560 --> 17:55.240
Well, I can't because there's
no room in my fucking bed any more!

18:03.160 --> 18:05.240
You agreed to have this child.

18:05.280 --> 18:07.720
Only because you wanted it so much.

18:07.760 --> 18:09.960
I wanted you to have
a child of your own!

18:10.000 --> 18:11.800
What? You...
You think that I didn't?

18:11.840 --> 18:15.960
No-one wanted a baby as much as me,
you know that. And now you have her!

18:16.000 --> 18:18.040
I don't love her.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.800
Well, I do.

18:26.960 --> 18:28.960
And I am not even her father

18:47.720 --> 18:50.800
Hi, this is Paul Haynes.

18:50.840 --> 18:52.840
Leave your message after the beep.

18:52.880 --> 18:56.240
Is everything all right?

18:56.280 --> 18:59.920
Yeah. She had another bad dream
last night, didn't you, love?

19:00.920 --> 19:03.720
She was really cold.
Mummy warmed you, didn't she?

19:13.160 --> 19:15.680
Are you still cold, Evie?

19:29.000 --> 19:31.560
Thanks.

19:35.680 --> 19:37.840
Is, er, Joe coming to school?

19:37.880 --> 19:41.600
No school for him today. Punishment.

19:48.680 --> 19:51.800
Oi! Watch what you're doing!

19:51.840 --> 19:54.480
What the hell are you playing at?
Well, I'm sure she didn't mean it.

19:54.520 --> 19:56.520
Of course she bloody did!
You try that again,

19:56.560 --> 19:58.560
you'll have hell to pay.
You hear me?

20:03.440 --> 20:06.720
Everything all right?
These fucking kids.

20:28.640 --> 20:31.640
Harrow on the Hill
and London Marylebone.

20:31.680 --> 20:34.720
This train has five carriages.

20:34.760 --> 20:38.240
Platform five for the...

21:20.120 --> 21:22.480
Hi.

21:22.520 --> 21:25.360
Hi. Hope this isn't a bad time.

21:25.400 --> 21:27.680
Ward 300 have asked me
to get a psych report

21:27.720 --> 21:30.640
about what happened at the swings.
Oh, well, they're sleeping now.

21:30.680 --> 21:35.160
It's their rest time.
Oh, I thought it would be better to

21:35.200 --> 21:38.720
do it at the school,
don't want to upset the parents.

21:40.600 --> 21:44.120
We... We could just wake
one of them. Nathan maybe?

21:44.160 --> 21:47.000
Does Paul know about this?
Oh, yeah.

21:49.880 --> 21:52.760
Er, we'll be fine from here. Thanks.

21:58.520 --> 22:00.960
There.
Shall we come and sit over here?

22:01.960 --> 22:04.960
So, Nathan,

22:05.000 --> 22:08.760
do you know why
I want to talk to you?

22:10.440 --> 22:13.000
I just want to talk about
what happened on the swings.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.520
Nothing happened.

22:15.560 --> 22:20.000
Well, David got hurt,
so something must have happened.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
Did David make you angry?

22:25.000 --> 22:30.600
Did David's daddy make you angry,
so you hurt David?

22:37.920 --> 22:42.200
If I made you angry,
could you hurt me?

22:42.240 --> 22:44.640
I don't want to.

22:44.680 --> 22:47.160
But if you wanted to, could you?

22:55.040 --> 22:58.880
Is there someone else
that you've hurt?

22:58.920 --> 23:01.200
Someone else who made you angry?

23:03.080 --> 23:07.640
Nathan, the others are asleep,
they're not with you now. It's OK.

23:07.680 --> 23:12.280
It's OK, you can tell me,
they won't find out. They will.

23:12.320 --> 23:15.760
I can't.
Nathan, talk to me.

23:15.800 --> 23:18.280
Did Sunny's mummy make you angry?

23:21.640 --> 23:23.640
Did you hurt her?

23:25.520 --> 23:27.520
It was her fault.

23:31.640 --> 23:33.880
Why was it her fault?

23:36.560 --> 23:39.400
Because she wanted
to take Sunny away?

23:41.640 --> 23:45.320
Why are you having bad dreams?
You can tell me.

23:45.360 --> 23:48.680
Evie is cold in her dreams.
No, she isn't.

23:48.720 --> 23:51.480
Are you cold now?
You're making me cold.

23:51.520 --> 23:53.440
I'm not trying to.

23:54.440 --> 23:56.760
What's frightening you?
Stop it.

23:56.800 --> 23:59.760
What are you dreaming about,
Nathan? It's OK. Tell me, Nathan.

23:59.800 --> 24:02.920
Tell me about your dreams.
Let me out! Let us out! Let us out!

24:02.960 --> 24:05.880
Let us out!
Let us out! Let me out!

24:05.920 --> 24:09.000
Let us out! Let us out!

24:09.040 --> 24:11.960
Let us out!

24:14.440 --> 24:16.440
What's going on?
Mr Clyde. Nathan.

24:16.480 --> 24:19.960
What happened?
I didn't do anything! It was her!

24:26.160 --> 24:28.840
Local paper? Local paper, sir?

24:30.840 --> 24:34.160
Local paper? Local paper, sir?

24:34.200 --> 24:37.920
Local paper, ma'am? Local paper?

24:45.280 --> 24:48.440
You've reached Amrita Chohhan.
I can't get to the phone right now

24:48.480 --> 24:52.880
but leave a message after the beep.
Hi, Amrita. Please call me back.

24:52.920 --> 24:55.800
I'm in London.
I need to speak to you.

25:10.920 --> 25:14.320
All right, Zoe Moran,
time to come clean. What's wrong?

25:15.360 --> 25:17.840
I've spent the last two hours
talking about myself,

25:17.880 --> 25:21.640
my work, my ridiculous love life.
You've barely said a word.

25:21.680 --> 25:24.960
Sorry.
You haven't even drunk the wine.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.240
What happened to that
party girl I used to know?

25:27.280 --> 25:31.480
I can't say. Is this what
the countryside does to people?

25:31.520 --> 25:34.800
Come on. Why did you call me?

25:34.840 --> 25:38.080
Is it Sam? Are you having problems?

25:40.400 --> 25:42.600
Honestly, I can't say.

25:42.640 --> 25:45.840
Zoe, has something happened?

25:46.840 --> 25:48.840
I think I'm going mad, Jamie.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.520
It's OK.

25:53.680 --> 25:55.680
I'm really going mad.

25:56.680 --> 25:58.400
Fuck's sake.

25:58.440 --> 26:00.440
Why did you leave London?

26:00.480 --> 26:04.680
You've lost touch with all your
friends. I mean, I know you wanted

26:04.720 --> 26:07.120
a baby but a kid can't be
the only thing in your life.

26:07.160 --> 26:09.560
She's not my kid.

26:10.680 --> 26:12.680
She's not my kid.

26:13.680 --> 26:16.040
I can explain. No, no.
You don't have to explain anything.

26:16.080 --> 26:18.760
Sam Clyde called me
and he told me everything.

26:18.800 --> 26:20.800
What the hell were you doing?

26:20.840 --> 26:24.200
I needed to talk to the children.
I tried to call you.

26:24.240 --> 26:26.880
You have no authority
to speak to Nathan like that.

26:26.920 --> 26:30.040
I tried to call you three times.
You went behind my back.

26:30.080 --> 26:32.480
His mother had to pick him up.
You scared the shit out of him.

26:32.520 --> 26:34.520
Yeah, because I found something out.

26:35.520 --> 26:38.040
What exactly?

26:42.480 --> 26:44.920
The children are having
a recurrent dream.

26:44.960 --> 26:49.120
It's winter, frozen ground.

26:49.160 --> 26:51.800
A room of some kind.

26:51.840 --> 26:54.560
It's been happening
ever since Sunny came here.

26:54.600 --> 26:58.440
Their behaviour
has become more erratic.

26:58.480 --> 27:00.880
It's like they're
scared of something,

27:00.920 --> 27:03.680
something they can't tell us.

27:03.720 --> 27:06.720
I think it has something
to do with Amrita Chohhan.

27:10.760 --> 27:14.560
What? What aren't you telling me?

27:16.120 --> 27:20.960
Nothing, Susannah. No, you're
hiding something. No, not at all.

27:22.640 --> 27:25.440
I am, however,
concerned that the children

27:25.480 --> 27:27.800
may be triggering your own memories.

27:29.840 --> 27:31.840
This isn't about me.

27:31.880 --> 27:34.560
We did speak about this
when you were first employed.

27:34.600 --> 27:38.920
Spoke about what? My past is my
business and it has absolutely

27:38.960 --> 27:41.560
no relevance whatsoever
to what is happening here.

27:41.600 --> 27:44.440
You have the tendency
to see malign intentions...

27:44.480 --> 27:46.600
I did, once.
..in children.

27:52.360 --> 27:54.800
Not any more.

27:56.400 --> 27:59.400
Does your daughter
even know what happened?

28:03.840 --> 28:06.200
DCI Haynes is leading
the investigation

28:06.240 --> 28:08.360
into the disappearance
of Amrita Chohhan.

28:09.360 --> 28:11.360
Go home.

28:12.520 --> 28:14.520
Leave the children alone.

28:26.160 --> 28:28.600
What the hell was that about?

28:30.200 --> 28:33.080
There's something you need
to know about Susannah Zellaby.

28:36.280 --> 28:38.600
It's like they are
in league with the children.

28:38.640 --> 28:41.520
They watch us all the time,

28:41.560 --> 28:45.800
tell us how many visitors
we can have, what we can say,

28:45.840 --> 28:48.680
what school our kids go to,

28:48.720 --> 28:50.720
who we can call on the phone.

28:50.760 --> 28:52.920
And Sam acts like
it's totally normal.

28:54.120 --> 28:56.120
I tried to fit in, I tried so hard,

28:56.160 --> 28:58.320
but I can't.
No, of course you can't.

28:59.800 --> 29:01.800
You can't tell anyone this.

29:01.840 --> 29:05.000
I've signed NDAs,
I'm legally bound to say nothing.

29:05.040 --> 29:07.640
This is insane, Zoe.

29:09.440 --> 29:11.440
Please believe me.

29:11.480 --> 29:15.000
Yeah, of course I do. Come here.

29:19.160 --> 29:21.160
It's not OK.

29:22.560 --> 29:25.040
Hey!
It's not.

29:44.640 --> 29:46.880
Come on. Let's go to mine.

29:50.080 --> 29:52.080
It's what you wanted, isn't it?

30:00.960 --> 30:02.760
What is it?

30:02.800 --> 30:05.200
Someone's watching us.

30:05.240 --> 30:07.240
What?

30:08.680 --> 30:10.680
OK. Cab's coming. Come on.

30:12.680 --> 30:14.680
They know I'm here.

30:14.720 --> 30:16.840
What?
They let me come here.

30:16.880 --> 30:20.440
They wanted me to leave.

30:20.480 --> 30:22.640
Sorry?

30:22.680 --> 30:24.680
Oh, my God.

30:24.720 --> 30:26.720
I've been such a fool.

30:26.760 --> 30:28.760
Sam's the one they want.

30:30.200 --> 30:32.200
I've got to go. I've got to go now.

30:32.240 --> 30:36.400
Zoe! You cannot
tell anyone what I told you.

30:36.440 --> 30:39.080
You cannot say a fucking word.

30:44.280 --> 30:45.760
Jeez!

30:54.160 --> 30:57.440
Well, I guess there's
always next time, babe.

30:58.680 --> 31:00.680
Yeah, I know.

31:00.720 --> 31:02.720
Yeah, you too.

31:02.760 --> 31:06.840
All right. I'll talk to you late.

31:06.880 --> 31:09.000
Bye.

31:09.040 --> 31:11.560
What happened at the school?
They're all talking about it.

31:11.600 --> 31:13.720
They're furious.
I was trying to understand

31:13.760 --> 31:15.840
why the children are
sleeping so badly, that's all.

31:15.880 --> 31:19.920
That's not what I heard.
Evie came home in tears.

31:19.960 --> 31:22.640
Who was that on the phone?
Nora.

31:22.680 --> 31:27.000
We were supposed to be going out
tonight but now Evie needs me,

31:27.040 --> 31:30.400
so everything's screwed up.
Well, you can leave her with me.

31:30.440 --> 31:33.160
The fuck I can.
Of course you can.

31:33.200 --> 31:35.360
I'm her grandmother for God's sake.

31:35.400 --> 31:38.720
Oh, Cass, come on.
I've been looking after her

31:38.760 --> 31:42.440
with you now for two years.
You're young, you should go out

31:42.480 --> 31:47.240
and have some fun.
Everything will be fine, I promise.

31:47.280 --> 31:49.440
Trust me.

32:14.120 --> 32:16.360
This is Zoe Moran.
Please leave a message.

32:23.760 --> 32:25.240
Hey.

32:27.160 --> 32:29.480
Has something upset you?

32:39.640 --> 32:42.160
You let him shout at me, Daddy.

32:43.160 --> 32:45.160
Why did you do that?

32:59.680 --> 33:02.320
Curtis, I wanna talk to you.

33:02.360 --> 33:04.360
What's this?

33:04.400 --> 33:06.960
Look, I don't want you
shouting at my kid,

33:07.000 --> 33:10.240
accusing her of things
she didn't do, OK? Your kid?

33:10.280 --> 33:12.280
What did you say?

33:15.040 --> 33:17.040
You heard.

33:17.080 --> 33:20.160
Take that back.
I said take that back.

33:27.640 --> 33:29.440
Ugh!

33:29.480 --> 33:31.120
Argh!

33:31.160 --> 33:33.160
Ugh!

33:42.600 --> 33:43.960
Stop it!

33:45.400 --> 33:47.440
No!

34:18.000 --> 34:20.640
Where's Mummy going?

34:20.680 --> 34:25.360
Just to see a friend for a few
hours. Why didn't she say goodbye?

34:25.400 --> 34:27.840
Well, because she wouldn't
have gone if she had.

34:27.880 --> 34:32.680
She'll be back later and you
and I can spend some time together.

34:32.720 --> 34:34.720
You made her go.

34:41.080 --> 34:43.080
Where have you been?
I had a meeting.

34:43.120 --> 34:45.280
I've been trying
to call you all afternoon.

34:45.320 --> 34:48.200
He's asking after you.

34:48.240 --> 34:50.560
That fucking shrink
really terrified him.

34:50.600 --> 34:53.720
Paul, he sees you as a parent,
don't you understand?

34:53.760 --> 34:55.760
Jesus Christ,
I've just walked through the door.

34:55.800 --> 34:58.280
If I threaten to move out, then
you give me the charm offensive.

34:58.320 --> 35:00.640
Otherwise it's a brick wall.
That's not what is happening.

35:00.680 --> 35:02.480
Can I go and speak
to Nathan, please?

35:02.520 --> 35:05.360
You're lying about something.
I need to know what it is.

35:05.400 --> 35:07.600
I'm not lying.
I just wanna go and see my boy.

35:07.640 --> 35:10.920
Your boy? He's my son!

35:13.680 --> 35:17.600
I've not finished. Paul! Paul,
can you come back here, please?

35:17.640 --> 35:22.040
Paul! Come here, Nathan. Paul,
come here. Sit down. Dad? Paul!

35:22.080 --> 35:26.480
Open the door!
Open the door!

35:26.520 --> 35:31.360
Nathan, you listen to me and you
tell me truthfully. I'm his mother.

35:31.400 --> 35:34.440
Amrita Chohhan, do you know
what happened to her?

35:34.480 --> 35:37.040
What are you talking about? Did you
have anything to do with that?

35:37.080 --> 35:42.160
This is ridiculous. Nathan, if you
love me, you'll tell me the truth.

35:43.960 --> 35:47.400
No, Dad, we did nothing, I promise.

35:50.560 --> 35:52.240
OK.

35:54.120 --> 35:57.560
Nathan, the others are asleep.
They're not with you now, it's OK.

35:57.600 --> 36:01.840
It's OK, you can tell me.
They won't find out.

36:01.880 --> 36:07.040
They will. I can't. Everything's OK.
It's OK. You can tell me.

36:07.080 --> 36:11.160
Tell me, Nathan, tell me about
your dream. Hi, Granny.

36:12.680 --> 36:14.680
Jesus!

36:20.320 --> 36:22.320
I thought you were angry with me.

36:22.360 --> 36:26.000
I'm not angry.
Can we go for a walk?

36:26.040 --> 36:28.040
What, now?

36:30.040 --> 36:33.120
It's past your bedtime.
Please.

36:33.160 --> 36:36.080
I want to tell you about my dream.

36:44.240 --> 36:46.880
I didn't know you liked it out here.

36:46.920 --> 36:48.520
I love it, Granny.

36:48.560 --> 36:51.440
# Who would true valiant be

36:51.480 --> 36:53.760
# Let him come hither...

36:53.800 --> 36:55.960
You like that song, don't you?

36:56.000 --> 37:00.600
It's the school hymn.
# One here will constant be

37:00.640 --> 37:02.800
# Come wind, come weather. #

37:02.840 --> 37:07.320
Granny, did you and Mummy
used to take walks like this

37:07.360 --> 37:09.360
when she was little?

37:09.400 --> 37:11.720
Yeah, of course we did.

37:13.360 --> 37:15.600
It must have been so nice.

37:17.040 --> 37:20.160
Look, Evie,

37:20.200 --> 37:23.280
I think you should
tell me about your dream.

37:23.320 --> 37:25.760
Can we play hide and seek first?

37:25.800 --> 37:27.800
Please.

37:27.840 --> 37:29.800
OK. One game.

37:29.840 --> 37:33.040
And then we sit down
and you tell me everything,

37:33.080 --> 37:35.080
everything you know.

37:35.120 --> 37:37.400
OK. I'll hide!

37:42.640 --> 37:47.520
One, two, three, four, five,

37:47.560 --> 37:50.720
six, seven,

37:50.760 --> 37:54.000
eight, nine, ten.

37:56.160 --> 37:58.160
Coming, ready or not!

38:03.120 --> 38:05.120
Now, where could she be?

38:07.480 --> 38:09.480
Is she over here?

38:12.080 --> 38:14.080
Hmm!

38:23.800 --> 38:25.680
Who's behind here?

38:32.560 --> 38:34.040
Evie!

38:36.320 --> 38:38.280
Evie!

38:47.920 --> 38:49.920
Dad?

38:51.920 --> 38:53.920
Everything OK?

38:58.520 --> 39:01.400
Then, what is it?
Evie's worried.

39:01.440 --> 39:03.840
She thinks Dr Zellaby's
going to hurt her.

39:05.760 --> 39:09.480
Yeah, no. I... I don't know.

39:09.520 --> 39:14.000
I just have this feeling
that I should be with Evie tonight.

39:16.240 --> 39:18.080
Hold on. I'll call you back.

39:18.120 --> 39:21.360
Cassie, is your mother in?
I need to talk to her.

39:21.400 --> 39:24.640
She just texted me.
Her and Evie have gone for a walk.

39:24.680 --> 39:26.200
Where?

39:32.360 --> 39:34.360
Evie!

39:40.760 --> 39:42.920
Evie, where are you?

39:48.760 --> 39:51.120
Evie!

39:51.160 --> 39:52.960
Hi, Granny.

39:54.000 --> 39:58.840
You have a tendency to see
malign intentions in children.

39:58.880 --> 40:01.960
Not any more.

40:12.360 --> 40:14.680
# Let him in constancy

40:14.720 --> 40:16.680
# Follow the Master. #
Evie!

40:21.160 --> 40:23.160
Evie!

40:28.880 --> 40:30.320
Evie.

40:30.360 --> 40:35.160
You think we're bad.
You want us to die.

40:35.200 --> 40:37.440
Evie, get off the track.

40:39.520 --> 40:40.920
Evie!

40:52.600 --> 40:55.440
No! Evie! Please come back!

40:55.480 --> 40:56.680
No.

40:57.840 --> 40:59.640
You're going to hurt me!

41:03.680 --> 41:04.920
Evie!

41:08.600 --> 41:11.240
No! Evie!

41:11.280 --> 41:12.480
Evie!

41:12.520 --> 41:14.800
Help me!
Come to me.

41:16.280 --> 41:19.920
Mum, what's going on?
She tried to hurt me! No, Cassie.

41:19.960 --> 41:22.640
No. No, Cassie.
Mum, what have you done?

41:22.680 --> 41:24.560
Nothing.
I need you to come with me.

41:32.760 --> 41:36.520
Cassie, you have to listen to me.
He told me in the car,

41:36.560 --> 41:39.960
he told me everything.
Just leave us alone, OK?

41:41.600 --> 41:44.920
Cassie, wait. You're a liar
and you're not safe to live with.

41:54.960 --> 41:57.000
Oh, my God.
I'm OK.

41:57.040 --> 42:00.240
What happened? Who did this?

42:00.280 --> 42:03.440
Curtis. It was my fault.

42:03.480 --> 42:08.240
I... I instigated it.
Why?

42:09.760 --> 42:11.760
It was Hannah.

42:11.800 --> 42:13.800
She made me do it.

42:21.440 --> 42:24.920
I'll get some cream for the bruise.
No. Just stay with me for a bit.

42:24.960 --> 42:27.280
Please.

42:32.040 --> 42:34.640
Where did you go?

42:34.680 --> 42:37.000
Just away, Sam.

42:37.040 --> 42:39.120
Away where?

42:41.000 --> 42:44.320
It doesn't matter.
What matters is that I'm back.

42:50.960 --> 42:54.080
I wanna get out of this...

42:55.520 --> 42:57.520
..but I don't know how.

42:59.640 --> 43:01.640
It's OK.

43:01.680 --> 43:04.080
We are going to
get out of this together.

43:05.080 --> 43:07.080
We're going to find a way.

44:03.240 --> 44:05.240
I'm sorry.

44:13.200 --> 44:15.560
I'm so sorry.

45:23.600 --> 45:28.680
# In April, I open my bill

45:28.720 --> 45:34.080
# In May, I sing night and day

45:34.120 --> 45:39.400
# In June, I change my tune

45:39.440 --> 45:44.880
# In July, far off I fly

45:44.920 --> 45:51.680
# In August, away I must

45:58.080 --> 46:03.360
# What do you do?

46:06.240 --> 46:09.160
# What do you do? #

46:10.960 --> 46:12.960
