08:20.784 --> 08:22.334
Is this
how y'all do business?

08:22.336 --> 08:24.169
I'm never coming back here
again...

08:24.171 --> 08:25.453
Till tomorrow.

08:25.455 --> 08:27.305
And you better
still have this policy

08:27.307 --> 08:28.640
where you give me
a free meal

08:28.642 --> 08:30.675
if I find a bat skull
in it.

08:30.677 --> 08:33.061
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait, wait.

08:33.063 --> 08:34.095
I'm a collector.

08:34.097 --> 08:36.097
No! Bones go in trash.

08:36.099 --> 08:39.484
Hey, boy, go plug this
in that outlet over there.

08:41.355 --> 08:43.572
You bring me some chow mein,
you hear me?

08:43.574 --> 08:46.491
And it better not have one
of these bones in it.

08:46.493 --> 08:48.309
The bone man,
they called him.

08:48.311 --> 08:50.529
He got away with it
for quite some time.

08:50.531 --> 08:54.032
But then he got lazy,
started mailing it in.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.952
Is this why you call
this peking duck?

08:56.954 --> 08:59.838
I see a bunch of possum bones
"peeking" out of it.

08:59.840 --> 09:03.157
They are duck bones.
Part of the duck.

09:03.159 --> 09:04.826
So it is.

09:04.828 --> 09:06.845
I suppose
this is how y'all do here.

09:06.847 --> 09:10.015
Yes, this<i> is</i> how we do here.

09:10.017 --> 09:12.017
I see.

09:12.019 --> 09:14.052
Run, boy!

09:14.054 --> 09:17.939
Early, you're not thinking of
pulling your daddy's old hustle.

09:17.941 --> 09:21.309
Hell nah. I ain't playin'
that old man's game.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.445
I'm taking it
to the next level.

09:23.447 --> 09:25.564
Look here. I found
a possum pelvis

09:25.566 --> 09:28.483
in all four of these
steel-belted radials.

09:28.485 --> 09:29.651
Say it.

09:29.653 --> 09:30.852
What is the meaning
of this?!

09:30.854 --> 09:32.070
There ya go.

09:32.072 --> 09:35.189
And you expect me to pay
for an unlimited data plan

09:35.191 --> 09:36.791
with a rat carcass in it?

09:36.793 --> 09:37.993
I refuse!

09:37.995 --> 09:39.327
And I want
this wireless headset.

09:39.329 --> 09:40.662
Is this
how y'all do here?

09:40.664 --> 09:42.297
I'm not usually the one
to complain,

09:42.299 --> 09:45.584
but I was trying on these here
crisp new boot-cut sparkle jeans

09:45.586 --> 09:47.368
and I found a bat skull
in the pocket.

09:47.370 --> 09:48.887
Varmints in the garments --

09:48.889 --> 09:50.872
that's what I'm gonna be tellin'
everybody about this store.

09:50.874 --> 09:53.892
I also found animal bones
in these summer cargo shorts.

09:53.894 --> 09:56.511
And the breast pocket
of this hot-ass rodeo shirt.

09:56.513 --> 09:58.046
Is this how y'all do?

09:58.048 --> 10:01.399
Sir, step away from
that hot-ass rodeo shirt.

10:01.401 --> 10:03.852
Sorry, guys.
Uh, health code violation.

10:03.854 --> 10:05.570
There must be an infestation
or something

10:05.572 --> 10:06.938
around dougal county.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.440
We just had to shut down
noodle buddha.

10:08.442 --> 10:10.275
But I got a lunch appointment
there today.

10:10.277 --> 10:11.910
Oh, you
don't want to eat there.

10:11.912 --> 10:14.446
I heard somebody found a bat
skull in his cashew chicken.

10:14.448 --> 10:15.914
That was me.
We did it.

10:15.916 --> 10:17.499
<i> All you gotta do</i>
<i> is put a bone in something,</i>

10:17.501 --> 10:18.700
<i> and then they'll give it</i>
<i> to you.</i>

10:18.702 --> 10:19.868
<i> You get that?</i>

10:19.870 --> 10:22.621
Loud and clear.
Take 'em down.

10:22.623 --> 10:24.623
Wait, sheriff.
There's plenty of this

10:24.625 --> 10:25.840
to go around...

10:25.842 --> 10:27.926
For those
who can stay silent.

10:27.928 --> 10:29.461
Can I cut a deal if
I flip on him?

10:29.463 --> 10:31.463
Nunh-unh.
<i> He's</i> the one who done it.

10:31.465 --> 10:33.715
He made me do it.
You can see it.
No, you lie!
He's the one that did it.

10:33.717 --> 10:36.351
All these bones in the cell.

10:36.353 --> 10:37.752
Is this how y'all do things?

10:37.754 --> 10:39.804
I ain't giving you shit.
