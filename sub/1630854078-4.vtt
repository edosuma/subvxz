WEBVTT

00:01.044 --> 00:02.881
[June] Previously
on The Handmaid's Tale...

00:03.131 --> 00:04.551
-[June] What was that color?
-[Luke] Yeah.

00:04.635 --> 00:05.929
-What does purple mean?
-[Moira] I don't know.

00:06.012 --> 00:06.847
It's not pink, though.

00:06.931 --> 00:08.099
She's not a little girl anymore.

00:10.103 --> 00:11.231
[June] The purple color

00:11.815 --> 00:13.235
Hannah was wearing.
What does it mean?

00:13.569 --> 00:14.487
[Nick] It means she's ready.

00:15.030 --> 00:15.865
New school.

00:16.617 --> 00:17.911
Training for future wives.

00:18.245 --> 00:19.581
[exhales] Wives?

00:20.541 --> 00:23.631
How am I supposed to keep
my baby girl safe from here?

00:25.050 --> 00:26.052
[Serena] I want to stay here.

00:26.929 --> 00:30.018
[Mark] You must realize it's not
safe for women in this place.

00:30.185 --> 00:31.689
Especially unmarried women.

00:32.314 --> 00:34.736
I don't believe that will be
my situation for much longer.

00:35.320 --> 00:36.447
[mimics engine]

00:36.532 --> 00:37.909
[Janine] She's not
as tough as we think.

00:39.370 --> 00:40.205
She's scared.

00:40.330 --> 00:41.834
[Janine] Somebody... help!

00:41.917 --> 00:43.420
No! Oh, God! Janine!

00:43.754 --> 00:45.132
Dear God,

00:45.508 --> 00:47.679
please do not punish her
to teach me a lesson.

00:47.804 --> 00:49.473
I can turn things around!
I will.

00:50.350 --> 00:51.185
I promise you.

00:51.937 --> 00:53.816
[Commander Mackenzie]
We want you in Toronto.

00:54.442 --> 00:56.739
To best represent
our sacred republic.

00:57.323 --> 00:58.158
[gasps]

01:00.037 --> 01:03.126
Never touch my daughter again.

01:05.297 --> 01:07.301
-[traffic passing]
-[swing creaking]

01:14.566 --> 01:16.319
[Nichole cooing]

01:30.556 --> 01:33.478
[Nichole babbles]

01:43.916 --> 01:44.751
[woman] How old is she?

01:44.918 --> 01:46.087
-[Nichole coos]
-Excuse me?

01:46.713 --> 01:47.882
Around 14 months?

01:48.383 --> 01:49.678
-She's breathtaking.
-[chuckles softly]

01:50.513 --> 01:51.347
Thank you.

01:52.182 --> 01:53.393
It's Nichole, right?

01:56.315 --> 01:57.401
[Nichole babbles]

01:57.944 --> 01:58.779
I know who you are.

01:58.863 --> 01:59.865
Wanna go home, sweetie?

01:59.948 --> 02:01.033
-June Osborn?
-Come on.

02:01.117 --> 02:02.537
-So that's Baby Nichole.
-[Nichole coos]

02:02.787 --> 02:04.583
-[siren wailing]
-Whee!

02:05.501 --> 02:07.463
Get your boots on there.
Go home?

02:08.465 --> 02:09.926
I always wanted a girl.

02:10.010 --> 02:10.845
[Nichole babbles]

02:11.053 --> 02:12.640
Both of my pregnancies
were boys.

02:13.099 --> 02:14.018
We're gonna go home.

02:14.769 --> 02:15.772
Ready to go home?

02:20.531 --> 02:22.284
You're so lucky
you were in Gilead.

02:22.952 --> 02:23.788
[Nichole coos]

02:23.871 --> 02:26.209
Now you have
this beautiful, precious...

02:27.294 --> 02:28.463
healthy little angel.

02:29.006 --> 02:30.510
Hey, hey.
Do not touch my daughter.

02:31.093 --> 02:32.137
-But she's God's child!
-Back up!

02:32.387 --> 02:33.724
You get the fuck away from her!

02:34.851 --> 02:36.479
You don't deserve her, slut!

02:36.980 --> 02:37.816
Whore!

02:41.322 --> 02:42.324
What did you say to me?

02:43.577 --> 02:44.411
Huh?

02:49.631 --> 02:50.716
Fuck you!

03:03.116 --> 03:05.872
[Lisa] Infertility takes
a tremendous physical

03:05.955 --> 03:08.669
and psychological toll,
especially in these times.

03:09.796 --> 03:12.259
Extreme responses like
this woman's aren't uncommon.

03:12.802 --> 03:13.888
You were right to be on guard.

03:14.931 --> 03:15.766
Thank you.

03:16.309 --> 03:18.522
You were just
protecting Nichole.

03:18.731 --> 03:19.566
And so...

03:25.911 --> 03:28.333
I went
a little past protecting.

03:33.343 --> 03:34.345
[Luke] How past?

03:36.265 --> 03:37.184
Just past.

03:41.860 --> 03:42.695
It got...

03:44.741 --> 03:45.576
physical.

03:46.870 --> 03:47.705
[exhales]

03:50.670 --> 03:51.755
Was she all... all right?

03:52.130 --> 03:53.842
-[June chuckles]
-[chuckles]

03:55.763 --> 03:56.765
I didn't stop to find out.

03:58.852 --> 03:59.688
[Lisa] We knew

03:59.979 --> 04:02.401
that Serena's return
would be incredibly challenging

04:02.484 --> 04:03.987
-for June's whole--
-Her return

04:04.113 --> 04:05.281
to people praying for her.

04:05.407 --> 04:07.077
Right?
Like she's a fucking saint.

04:07.745 --> 04:08.997
Sorry, I'm sorry. Just, sorry.

04:09.708 --> 04:10.543
Just, uh,

04:11.043 --> 04:14.258
how do we know that, um,

04:14.926 --> 04:17.013
that you... that she, uh,

04:17.932 --> 04:18.767
won't...

04:20.646 --> 04:21.815
get physical again?

04:22.900 --> 04:23.736
Yeah.

04:23.819 --> 04:24.821
Yeah, it's a good question.

04:26.157 --> 04:27.451
[Lisa sighs] That...

04:29.163 --> 04:32.587
sounds like
it will be really difficult.

04:35.133 --> 04:35.968
Yeah.

04:37.179 --> 04:38.014
Yeah.

04:39.308 --> 04:40.644
[door opens, beeps]

04:44.986 --> 04:46.573
Will the Canadian government
be watching me,

04:46.656 --> 04:47.867
like the ICC has?

04:48.660 --> 04:49.746
They don't anticipate

04:49.829 --> 04:52.250
any need for
round-the-clock surveillance.

04:52.752 --> 04:54.213
So, some measure of privacy.

04:54.421 --> 04:55.256
That's a relief.

04:56.258 --> 04:57.093
Yes.

04:57.887 --> 04:59.014
I imagine it is.

04:59.891 --> 05:00.726
Serena.

05:00.810 --> 05:01.812
One last time...

05:02.104 --> 05:02.939
[honking]

05:04.149 --> 05:07.782
I strongly urge you to accept
Canada's offer of asylum.

05:09.451 --> 05:10.286
To keep you safe.

05:11.121 --> 05:12.332
As an American citizen.

05:17.259 --> 05:18.720
I'm not an American citizen.

05:19.639 --> 05:20.891
My allegiance is to God.

05:22.979 --> 05:23.814
[sighs]

05:25.358 --> 05:27.572
Then, Mrs. Waterford,
you are officially released

05:27.655 --> 05:30.160
from the custody
of the American government.

05:30.995 --> 05:33.291
You'll be restricted
to Gilead-affiliated properties

05:33.374 --> 05:35.504
in accordance with
your lack of diplomatic status.

05:44.354 --> 05:45.649
Blessed day, Mrs. Waterford.

05:45.816 --> 05:46.735
I'm Ezra Shaw.

05:47.319 --> 05:48.530
Blessed day, Mr. Shaw.

05:48.614 --> 05:50.116
It's nice
to meet you face-to-face.

05:51.076 --> 05:53.331
Mr. Shaw will be
my escort from here on in.

05:54.918 --> 05:56.671
Gilead has made
all the arrangements.

05:58.216 --> 05:59.051
Well, then.

05:59.761 --> 06:00.596
Excuse me.

06:01.973 --> 06:02.808
Good luck.

06:03.309 --> 06:04.144
With your...

06:04.812 --> 06:05.814
future endeavors.

06:08.654 --> 06:09.488
I don't need luck.

06:10.406 --> 06:11.492
I have God on my side.

06:11.576 --> 06:12.410
Hmm. Then,

06:13.412 --> 06:14.707
may He guide your steps.

06:16.085 --> 06:16.878
Please, though,

06:17.212 --> 06:18.632
step carefully.

06:19.424 --> 06:20.552
You aren't in Gilead.

06:21.261 --> 06:23.140
This is a free country,
Mrs. Waterford.

06:40.341 --> 06:41.176
[door slams]

06:42.387 --> 06:43.222
[engine starts]

06:46.437 --> 06:47.898
[Ezra] Mrs. Waterford
is now secure

06:47.898 --> 06:48.984
and en route to the Center.

06:49.819 --> 06:51.740
[man over comms] Confirmed,
Mr. Shaw. Blessed be.

07:06.811 --> 07:07.980
Your home away from home.

07:09.232 --> 07:10.068
Looks promising.

07:11.111 --> 07:11.946
Shall we?

07:12.363 --> 07:13.199
Yes.

07:22.885 --> 07:23.887
[indistinct chatter]

07:27.477 --> 07:28.772
Living quarters are upstairs.

07:43.467 --> 07:44.302
Oh!

07:44.637 --> 07:46.473
Look who finally
fucking shows up.

07:46.975 --> 07:49.437
[sighs] My apologies. I was, uh,

07:49.730 --> 07:51.316
tied up
with internal debriefings.

07:51.483 --> 07:53.530
Internal debriefings
about my kid?

07:55.491 --> 07:56.326
Hi.

07:56.536 --> 07:57.370
How is she?

07:58.164 --> 08:00.084
I, I saw her.
I didn't speak to her.

08:00.418 --> 08:01.253
She looked good.

08:01.921 --> 08:02.756
Very healthy.

08:03.508 --> 08:04.342
[Luke] Healthy?

08:04.510 --> 08:06.723
You were this close to her,
and you didn't do anything.

08:06.806 --> 08:07.641
What are you doing?

08:08.309 --> 08:10.396
We are combing through
the intel we have gathered.

08:10.522 --> 08:12.275
That's all I'm able to disclose.

08:12.610 --> 08:13.945
Well, that's just
a bullshit answer.

08:14.864 --> 08:16.283
I came to give you
the official notice

08:16.366 --> 08:17.620
from the State Department.

08:19.624 --> 08:23.005
Mrs. Waterford is
no longer under our supervision.

08:23.590 --> 08:26.512
As of today, she has been
released from ICC custody.

08:28.265 --> 08:29.184
[Luke] You let that happen.

08:30.478 --> 08:31.313
Where is she?

08:32.691 --> 08:33.526
Here.

08:33.985 --> 08:36.532
Gilead owns
pre-war property in Toronto.

08:36.699 --> 08:39.538
Canada has decided
to unfreeze this asset

08:39.664 --> 08:42.210
in an effort
to improve relations.

08:43.546 --> 08:46.093
It will technically
be considered Gilead territory.

08:46.553 --> 08:48.222
So they're
opening a damn embassy?

08:49.182 --> 08:50.184
A Cultural Center.

08:50.936 --> 08:54.569
Serena will be in residence
to represent Gilead's lifeways,

08:54.652 --> 08:56.573
advocate for their values.

09:00.162 --> 09:01.541
The images
of Serena at the funeral

09:01.624 --> 09:03.586
were very successful for Gilead.

09:03.670 --> 09:06.133
They want her
to remain visible to the world.

09:07.260 --> 09:08.304
[Moira] Pregnant miracle.

09:08.638 --> 09:09.472
[Mark] Yes.

09:10.308 --> 09:11.476
[Luke] Get the fuck
out of my house.

09:12.980 --> 09:14.399
Get the fuck out of my house.

09:17.656 --> 09:19.159
She has no standing here.

09:21.330 --> 09:22.332
She has no status.

09:23.167 --> 09:24.629
She doesn't have a passport.

09:24.712 --> 09:26.089
There's no money in her name.

09:26.173 --> 09:27.467
She can't even drive a car.

09:28.553 --> 09:29.387
She's limited.

09:30.222 --> 09:31.224
I warned you about her.

09:33.813 --> 09:34.815
You won't listen.

09:39.700 --> 09:41.704
God, you're such
a fucking disappointment.

09:44.835 --> 09:47.549
Well, perhaps your expectations
are unrealistic.

09:50.388 --> 09:51.223
Have a good evening.

09:51.516 --> 09:52.350
[Moira] I'll see you out.

09:55.649 --> 09:57.235
I'm, I'm, I'm calling the city.

09:57.318 --> 09:59.280
We're gonna find out
where that place is.

09:59.364 --> 10:02.078
I... I know a guy who works
at the House of Commons.

10:02.161 --> 10:02.996
He's gonna help us.

10:03.080 --> 10:04.416
She always gets what she wants.

10:04.834 --> 10:05.877
No, no, no. Not this time.

10:05.961 --> 10:08.925
She's not gonna pull
a fucking Gilead bullshit here!

10:09.092 --> 10:10.762
No. By, by tomorrow morning,

10:10.929 --> 10:13.434
by-- I'll... we're gonna have
the whole fucking city on this.

10:14.352 --> 10:15.187
Look, June.

10:15.981 --> 10:16.816
Hmm?

10:17.400 --> 10:18.695
June, don't worry.

10:18.945 --> 10:20.239
All right?
We're gonna stop this.

10:22.243 --> 10:23.078
I'm not worried.

11:20.819 --> 11:21.654
[car door slams]

11:21.737 --> 11:23.741
[indistinct chatter]

12:06.702 --> 12:07.537
Fuck.

12:12.756 --> 12:13.591
[grunts]

12:16.012 --> 12:16.847
Fuck!

12:19.853 --> 12:20.689
Fuck.

12:21.314 --> 12:22.149

[car pulling away]

13:21.434 --> 13:22.269
[exhales]

13:23.438 --> 13:24.273
Are you all right, ma'am?

13:25.109 --> 13:26.862
Isn't there something
that you can do?

13:27.781 --> 13:29.325
I can't stop her from driving.

13:30.662 --> 13:32.331
But if she sets foot
on the property--

13:32.414 --> 13:33.250
Right.

13:33.793 --> 13:34.628
I understand.

13:35.212 --> 13:37.133
The alarms are set.
The cameras are on.

13:37.676 --> 13:38.636
Guard's at his post.

13:41.307 --> 13:42.142
Thank you, Ezra.

13:43.563 --> 13:44.731
I'll keep you both safe, ma'am.

13:45.692 --> 13:46.527
By His hand.

13:47.403 --> 13:48.238
Praise be.

13:56.045 --> 13:57.799
-[dog barks distantly]
-[breathing heavily, sniffles]

14:02.559 --> 14:03.393
-Hey.
-Hey.

14:08.571 --> 14:09.405
Um...

14:11.744 --> 14:12.913
I just drove to her building.

14:14.958 --> 14:15.793
[sighs]

14:17.797 --> 14:18.633
Yeah.

14:20.302 --> 14:22.766
I drove to her building
like a fucking crazy person.

14:24.603 --> 14:25.437
Okay.

14:27.609 --> 14:28.694
-[grunts]
-Is that it?

14:31.240 --> 14:32.661
[chuckles]

14:37.796 --> 14:38.881
All I can think about...

14:40.342 --> 14:41.720
is shooting her
in the fucking head.

14:42.221 --> 14:45.227
And I don't know how to stop
myself from actually doing it.

14:50.112 --> 14:50.947
[exhales]

14:53.619 --> 14:54.453
I get it.

14:57.961 --> 14:58.796
Look.

14:59.046 --> 15:00.925
She's in a building, right?

15:01.050 --> 15:01.885
Yup.

15:02.177 --> 15:04.473
And I know they're trying to
make it the new fucking Gilead.

15:04.808 --> 15:05.643
-But...
-[exhales]

15:05.727 --> 15:06.687
there's no army.

15:07.104 --> 15:07.939
I know that.

15:08.023 --> 15:09.651
What there is, is building codes

15:09.735 --> 15:12.072
and neighbors and a fucking
City Council, all right?

15:12.156 --> 15:15.287
And we can use those things
to shut her down.

15:15.788 --> 15:16.623
It's not gonna...

15:18.251 --> 15:19.462
It's not... [sighs]

15:20.965 --> 15:21.800
Fuck.

15:21.884 --> 15:23.804
All right, all right. Let's say
you shoot her in the head.

15:23.888 --> 15:25.600
All right? You shoot her,
and what happens then?

15:26.518 --> 15:27.979
They take Nichole from you.

15:28.814 --> 15:29.649
You get that?

15:29.733 --> 15:32.362
Like, we, we lose our
best chance of getting Hannah.

15:34.033 --> 15:34.868
That's what happens.

15:35.536 --> 15:36.370
So...

15:38.041 --> 15:39.043
can you let me try?

15:40.755 --> 15:41.590
[sniffles]

15:42.926 --> 15:43.761
Yeah.

15:44.721 --> 15:45.556
Yeah, of course.

15:46.349 --> 15:47.811
-It's gonna work, okay?
-Mmm.

15:54.866 --> 15:55.701
[groaning]

15:59.584 --> 16:00.460
Ow! Fuck.

16:00.586 --> 16:02.005
[whimpers] Sorry.

16:03.884 --> 16:05.513
-Just... just a few more, dear.
-[groans]

16:05.596 --> 16:06.430
-A few more.
-No.

16:06.515 --> 16:08.602
These exercises
are so important.

16:08.769 --> 16:09.604
Enough.

16:09.980 --> 16:10.815
[exhales]

16:11.357 --> 16:13.486
[breathing heavily]

16:14.739 --> 16:15.575
Ugh.

16:15.867 --> 16:17.452
Remember what the Lord said.

16:18.789 --> 16:19.875
-[groans]
-"Fear not."

16:20.793 --> 16:21.879
"Believe only,

16:22.004 --> 16:23.799
and she shall be made...

16:24.634 --> 16:25.468
-whole."
-[groans]

16:26.638 --> 16:28.601
Will you stop
talking about the Bible?

16:29.351 --> 16:30.521
My legs don't work!

16:30.646 --> 16:31.565
All right. All right.

16:32.399 --> 16:33.443
Just, just rest.

16:34.445 --> 16:35.280
[breathes deeply]

16:41.960 --> 16:43.338
Has Esther woken up yet?

16:45.091 --> 16:45.927
No.

16:47.722 --> 16:48.557
Serves her right.

16:50.310 --> 16:51.145
What?

16:52.272 --> 16:53.191
How could you say that?

16:54.778 --> 16:56.072
A girl so wicked

16:57.491 --> 16:59.913
that she would kill
her own sister

17:00.665 --> 17:02.084
deserves his retribution.

17:02.877 --> 17:04.756
She's a child.

17:05.257 --> 17:07.344
Who was hurt and abused.

17:07.679 --> 17:10.433
I told you that!
I warned you about her!

17:10.559 --> 17:12.563
I gave her an opportunity

17:12.647 --> 17:14.818
to live a life
of service and grace!

17:14.901 --> 17:15.820
Or else!

17:16.445 --> 17:17.281
Right?

17:17.865 --> 17:20.203
Live a life
of service and grace,

17:20.328 --> 17:21.163
or else,

17:21.289 --> 17:23.251
you would let her rot
in The Colonies!

17:23.961 --> 17:24.754
[laughing bitterly]

17:25.923 --> 17:27.092
I know you'd just...

17:28.094 --> 17:29.263
pluck her eye out.

17:32.770 --> 17:34.607
[whimpers]

17:36.110 --> 17:36.945
I gave you...

17:38.532 --> 17:40.786
the education you needed

17:42.540 --> 17:46.882
to live a safe
and meaningful life.

17:49.512 --> 17:50.973
And here you are.

17:51.892 --> 17:52.810
Still with us!

17:52.852 --> 17:53.687
Just stop it.

17:54.689 --> 17:57.444
I know what you do,
what you do to those girls.

17:57.528 --> 17:59.281
Your precious girls.

18:01.118 --> 18:02.329
I see you!

18:03.373 --> 18:04.751
I see who you really are!

18:06.087 --> 18:07.590
I've still got
one good eye, remember?

18:10.638 --> 18:11.890
You gonna take that one too?

18:31.972 --> 18:33.976
[telephone ringing distantly]

18:36.940 --> 18:38.276
They ran out of the ecru?

18:38.569 --> 18:40.113
That was the closest shade,
Mrs. Waterford.

18:41.115 --> 18:42.618
I have Commander Lawrence
on the secure line.

18:42.952 --> 18:44.079
Oh, excellent. Thank you.

18:47.545 --> 18:48.337
[telephone beeps]

18:48.672 --> 18:49.924
Hello, Commander Lawrence.

18:51.135 --> 18:53.139
So, Mrs. Waterford.

18:53.891 --> 18:54.976
What can I do for you?

18:56.103 --> 18:56.938
Well, great news.

18:57.272 --> 19:00.111
Some of the other consulates
have extended invitations.

19:01.197 --> 19:03.994
It seems that you
or someone in your office

19:04.077 --> 19:04.996
has declined them.

19:06.165 --> 19:07.000
On my behalf.

19:08.754 --> 19:09.589
[inhales sharply]

19:09.672 --> 19:13.931
Everyone is thrilled
by your work so far. Why...

19:14.766 --> 19:16.227
why overexert yourself?

19:20.653 --> 19:22.364
It seems
that recognition efforts

19:22.447 --> 19:24.201
in South America have stalled.

19:24.994 --> 19:26.957
And that political wives
have only heard

19:27.040 --> 19:29.546
of the worst rumors
of life back home.

19:30.673 --> 19:33.386
Gilead is
the only country on the planet

19:33.469 --> 19:35.558
that has had
an increase in live births,

19:35.641 --> 19:38.479
and I believe
that I am uniquely positioned

19:38.564 --> 19:41.318
to remind the local ambassadors
of that fact.

19:41.402 --> 19:43.949
Perhaps with an afternoon tea.

19:47.623 --> 19:50.504
Venezuela has expressed interest

19:50.588 --> 19:55.096
in some of our more successful
female education programs.

19:55.221 --> 19:58.436
An informal conversation
might be useful.

19:59.062 --> 19:59.898
Over tea.

20:02.110 --> 20:03.572
Yes. A lovely idea.

20:05.576 --> 20:06.536
So, uh,

20:06.786 --> 20:09.499
anything else
you wanna chat about?

20:09.959 --> 20:10.794
Poutine?

20:11.378 --> 20:13.299
Paint colors for the nursery?

20:14.259 --> 20:19.144
Nocturnal visits
from a certain local stalker?

20:22.442 --> 20:23.695
You heard about my visitor.

20:24.989 --> 20:27.118
Yeah. Ezra said you were jumpy.

20:27.202 --> 20:28.955
I'm not that easily intimidated,
Commander.

20:29.540 --> 20:30.375
She's just...

20:31.878 --> 20:33.632
stomping her feet like a child.

20:34.509 --> 20:35.343
Posturing.

20:37.055 --> 20:41.397
That child has been known
to misbehave.

20:42.566 --> 20:43.401
Badly.

20:45.196 --> 20:49.580
I'd stay focused on work,
and avoid her.

20:53.212 --> 20:54.549
I'll take that under advisement.

20:58.807 --> 21:00.184
Blessed day, Mrs. Waterford.

21:00.351 --> 21:01.478
Blessed day, Commander.

21:02.439 --> 21:03.274
[telephone beeps]

21:39.931 --> 21:40.766
[door opens]

21:46.068 --> 21:46.903
What happened?

21:50.034 --> 21:50.953
This came for you.

22:01.558 --> 22:04.856
[paper shuffling, tearing]

22:17.297 --> 22:18.465
[Moira] Jesus Christ.

22:21.096 --> 22:21.931
June.

22:22.473 --> 22:23.475
-June.
-Don't.

22:23.643 --> 22:24.812
[Luke] We can still stop this.

22:24.896 --> 22:26.649
How?
With fucking building codes?

22:27.025 --> 22:27.860
And lawsuits?

22:29.112 --> 22:31.366
Serena has the whole
goddamn world behind her.

22:31.450 --> 22:32.368
No, she doesn't.

22:32.578 --> 22:33.622
-We--
-[June] It's gonna happen here.

22:33.705 --> 22:35.291
-No, it is not.
-She is gonna bring it here.

22:35.374 --> 22:36.711
I swear to fucking God,

22:36.920 --> 22:38.047
she is gonna bring it here.

22:38.673 --> 22:40.677
The only way to stop her,

22:40.761 --> 22:43.432
and to stop them is to put
them all in the fucking ground!

22:43.683 --> 22:44.518
[Nichole crying]

22:51.156 --> 22:51.991
Fuck!

22:53.703 --> 22:55.206
[crying continues]

22:56.709 --> 22:57.544
I got it.

22:57.795 --> 22:58.588
Okay.

23:04.934 --> 23:08.315
[whispers] I'm sorry, baby girl.
I'm here now.

23:09.694 --> 23:10.696
I'm here, sweetie.

23:11.572 --> 23:12.407
Okay.

23:15.204 --> 23:16.039
Hey.

23:16.331 --> 23:17.166
Hey.

23:17.793 --> 23:18.628
I've got her.

23:19.212 --> 23:20.047
Yeah.

23:21.676 --> 23:22.720
[June] Who's a good girl?

23:24.515 --> 23:25.349
Here we go.

23:26.143 --> 23:26.978
Shh.

23:27.688 --> 23:28.857
-[Nichole cries]
-It's okay.

23:29.984 --> 23:30.944
Hey, baby girl.

23:31.946 --> 23:33.658
-[chuckles softly]
-You're fine, baby.

23:36.371 --> 23:37.206
Shit.

23:37.331 --> 23:38.167
[sniffles]

23:41.674 --> 23:42.509
What am I doing?

23:44.680 --> 23:45.640
What the fuck was that?

23:47.728 --> 23:48.813
Being really angry?

23:49.565 --> 23:50.399
[scoffs]

23:52.780 --> 23:54.199
Please don't tell me
to calm down, okay?

23:54.282 --> 23:55.117
Wasn't gonna.

23:55.660 --> 23:56.954
He has no idea what he's doing,

23:57.288 --> 23:58.792
and he seems
to have completely forgotten

23:58.875 --> 24:00.879
that none of this shit
worked the first time.

24:04.970 --> 24:05.972
June, he's right.

24:07.893 --> 24:09.104
This is a refugee town.

24:09.730 --> 24:10.732
An overcrowded one.

24:11.149 --> 24:12.360
And any of us make trouble,

24:12.443 --> 24:14.239
people start getting
thrown in jail,

24:14.615 --> 24:16.619
shipped off for resettlement
someplace else.

24:18.038 --> 24:19.332
We have to play by the rules.

24:20.585 --> 24:21.419
Okay?

24:21.587 --> 24:23.298
We can't do
that other stuff without

24:23.758 --> 24:25.554
bad shit happening
to a lot of people.

24:28.016 --> 24:30.312
Look, I will dance
on her grave with you,

24:30.730 --> 24:31.691
soon as the dirt's in.

24:33.570 --> 24:36.283
But she's not worth
losing your family over.

24:43.631 --> 24:45.259
What if this is who I am now?

24:51.062 --> 24:52.440
I don't worry
about you being with her.

24:53.651 --> 24:54.486
Not anymore.

24:56.198 --> 24:57.200
And that's not nothing.

25:03.755 --> 25:04.590
Yeah.

25:04.673 --> 25:05.508
[Moira] Okay.

25:09.140 --> 25:10.810
I'm just gonna
hang out in here for a while.

25:13.023 --> 25:14.067
Sounds good, Momma.

25:37.321 --> 25:39.660
And we can send
a lovely gift basket to Germany.

25:39.702 --> 25:40.537
Yes, ma'am.

25:42.164 --> 25:43.584
Excuse me, Mrs. Waterford.

25:44.753 --> 25:46.131
Luke Bankole is outside.

25:47.049 --> 25:47.968
He's asked to see you.

25:51.517 --> 25:52.351
Do we have time?

25:52.644 --> 25:53.478
[Ezra] Not much.

25:53.938 --> 25:55.065
If I may, Mrs. Waterford,

25:55.149 --> 25:56.777
I, I think I should handle this.

25:57.403 --> 25:58.363
Uh...

25:58.906 --> 25:59.742
No.

26:00.994 --> 26:02.455
No, that won't be necessary.

26:03.916 --> 26:06.046
Just a friendly chat
between old acquaintances.

26:16.024 --> 26:17.193
[door beeps, opens]

26:20.659 --> 26:21.493
[door closes]

26:29.300 --> 26:31.471
Have you checked him
for any security concerns?

26:31.764 --> 26:32.766
Yes, ma'am, of course.

26:33.475 --> 26:34.770
Let's check him again, please.

26:59.528 --> 27:01.406
Thank you. Give us a moment.

27:05.915 --> 27:06.751
Praise be, ma'am.

27:09.255 --> 27:11.009
So, why are you here,
Mr. Bankole?

27:12.888 --> 27:13.723
Why are you here?

27:14.767 --> 27:16.771
I'm here to spread His word
and to show the people

27:16.854 --> 27:18.691
that there is
a better way to live.

27:19.526 --> 27:21.321
There's a crowd
of people outside right now

27:21.404 --> 27:23.492
that would love to see you
shot down in the street.

27:25.120 --> 27:26.749
From what I can see, it's, um,

27:27.333 --> 27:28.335
quite the opposite.

27:35.600 --> 27:36.434
Building codes.

27:38.313 --> 27:40.400
I've found 15 violations

27:40.484 --> 27:42.071
that could
get this place condemned.

27:42.572 --> 27:43.866
I make a couple of calls

27:43.950 --> 27:46.079
and this place is shut down
in a matter of days.

27:47.958 --> 27:49.377
Is that what you came here
to tell me?

27:50.212 --> 27:51.924
That we have issues
with the plumbing here?

27:54.178 --> 27:55.013
Well, I...

27:55.305 --> 27:57.811
I also came here to tell you
that my wife...

27:58.938 --> 27:59.940
is gonna kill you.

28:02.069 --> 28:03.698
Right? And I'm gonna let her.

28:05.618 --> 28:06.537
Is that so?

28:06.912 --> 28:07.747
[Luke] Mmm-hmm.

28:09.751 --> 28:10.587
[clicks tongue] So...

28:12.507 --> 28:13.634
You can get kicked out,

28:16.097 --> 28:16.932
you could be killed,

28:20.105 --> 28:22.611
or just help us get Hannah back.

28:27.077 --> 28:28.121
Agnes is happy.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.336
She has fit and loving parents.

28:32.505 --> 28:34.175
Just as the good Lord intended.

28:36.262 --> 28:38.726
Who am I to question God's will?

28:45.990 --> 28:46.825
You know, come to think of it,

28:46.909 --> 28:49.455
I do wonder
why you never returned to Gilead

28:49.539 --> 28:50.792
to save your daughter.

28:52.294 --> 28:54.508
I mean,
there were risks of course.

28:55.551 --> 28:56.679
Which your wife took,

28:58.306 --> 28:59.392
and she suffered for them.

29:00.477 --> 29:01.312
Many times.

29:03.483 --> 29:05.278
Then again,
she did have Nick's support.

29:05.571 --> 29:07.074
I'm sure that gave you some...

29:07.951 --> 29:09.370
small comfort knowing that.

29:21.603 --> 29:23.314
You stay away from my family.

29:24.651 --> 29:25.862
Or the next time I see you,

29:25.945 --> 29:27.448
I'm gonna fucking
kill you myself.

29:37.134 --> 29:37.969
So,

29:38.052 --> 29:40.808
another
Handmaid-on-Handmaid attack.

29:42.478 --> 29:44.733
No fatalities this time.

29:46.152 --> 29:48.657
Fortunately,
Esther is the last of the girls

29:48.824 --> 29:50.118
to be under...

29:50.953 --> 29:51.914
her influence.

29:53.416 --> 29:54.376
Can't even say her name?

29:55.922 --> 29:56.757
June.

29:59.261 --> 30:00.723
There are smoother waters ahead.

30:01.098 --> 30:01.934
There better be.

30:03.186 --> 30:07.277
Gilead is opening its doors,
just... a crack.

30:07.361 --> 30:10.618
And when the world peeks inside
at our Handmaid system,

30:11.077 --> 30:14.835
let's just say it needs
to be running smoothly.

30:14.960 --> 30:15.795
No, uh,

30:16.755 --> 30:17.966
breakdowns.

30:18.341 --> 30:19.803
No assaults.

30:21.138 --> 30:23.894
No chocolates dipped in poison.

30:26.274 --> 30:29.238
Commander Lawrence,
I have come to believe

30:29.739 --> 30:32.996
that the Handmaid system
must be reformed.

30:33.454 --> 30:34.373
A new protocol.

30:35.458 --> 30:37.630
To prevent such
harmful incidents

30:37.714 --> 30:38.799
from happening in the future.

30:39.968 --> 30:40.970
I'm all ears.

30:42.472 --> 30:43.851
[clicks tongue] Handmaids...

30:44.895 --> 30:46.982
would remain under my care.

30:48.443 --> 30:51.324
Commanders and Wives
would visit each month,

30:52.200 --> 30:54.288
when it's time
to perform the Ceremony.

30:58.379 --> 31:02.597
You mean go to the Red Center?

31:04.266 --> 31:05.101
Kind of...

31:05.686 --> 31:07.230
Handmaids hotel,

31:07.356 --> 31:09.527
where you're the concierge?

31:11.364 --> 31:13.368
I believe God
will be better served

31:13.827 --> 31:17.125
if Handmaids are not posted
in households.

31:17.417 --> 31:18.837
What are you smoking?

31:18.879 --> 31:21.092
No Commander's
gonna buy into that.

31:21.551 --> 31:23.012
They're not interested
in some quick...

31:23.847 --> 31:26.561
in and out to make a baby.

31:27.020 --> 31:28.524
-Commander--
-They want those girls

31:28.649 --> 31:29.859
in their homes.

31:30.528 --> 31:31.445
Accessible.

31:32.322 --> 31:33.534
Any time. So they can...

31:34.243 --> 31:36.038
sniff the air
after they walk by,

31:36.122 --> 31:37.959
or do whatever
the hell they want.

31:38.794 --> 31:41.007
Get their rocks off.
These are pious men.

31:41.215 --> 31:42.342
They need a little kink.

31:43.386 --> 31:44.221
You know that.

31:46.475 --> 31:47.310
Do I?

31:49.064 --> 31:49.899
Don't you?

31:52.112 --> 31:53.197
The Handmaid system

31:54.074 --> 31:55.619
is not changing. Not now.

31:56.997 --> 31:58.249
So, get a grip on your girls.

32:02.550 --> 32:03.886
Not too tight though.

32:04.470 --> 32:06.683
We can't afford
to show any scars right now.

of the window

32:22.673 --> 32:24.259

Mrs. Waterford.

32:24.468 --> 32:25.805
Well, I think we do
three setups here,

32:25.888 --> 32:27.057

to your knees

You will beg for His grace
to redeem you when Gilead...

when any of them are struggling?
