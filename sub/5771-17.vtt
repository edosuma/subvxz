00:03.371 --> 00:05.573
(Mindy)
THIS MORNING I WOKE UP IN BED
WITH DANNY CASTELLANO,

00:05.606 --> 00:09.310
BECAUSE I AM STRAIGHT UP DATING
DANNY CASTELLANO.

00:09.343 --> 00:12.146
IT'S SO NICE TO WAKE UP,
TURN OVER, AND SEE DANNY

00:12.180 --> 00:13.647
INSTEAD OF THE KNIFE I HID
TO PROTECT MYSELF.

00:13.681 --> 00:14.882
STOP IT.
GO BACK TO BED.

00:14.915 --> 00:18.052
(Mindy)
OH, AND BEST OF ALL,
THE FREE PANCAKE BREAKFASTS.

00:18.086 --> 00:21.255
DANNY, WORK IS GONNA BE SO MUCH
MORE FUN NOW THAT WE'RE DATING.

00:21.289 --> 00:22.356
WE CAN TAKE X-RAYS OF US
MAKING OUT.

00:22.390 --> 00:24.625
YEAH, I ACTUALLY WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT.

00:24.658 --> 00:26.760
I WAS THINKING
MAYBE FOR NOW,

00:26.794 --> 00:29.297
WE SHOULD JUST...
BE COOL.

00:29.330 --> 00:31.399
"BE COOL"?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

00:31.432 --> 00:35.336
WELL, LOOK, IT'S BAD ENOUGH THAT
PETER ALREADY KNOWS ABOUT THIS.

00:35.369 --> 00:38.639
EVERY TIME I SEE HIM, HE ASKS ME
IF I'VE HAD ANY HOT CHOCOLATE.

00:38.672 --> 00:40.308
TALKING ABOUT
YOUR SKIN TONE, OKAY?

00:40.341 --> 00:42.276
I JUST--
I DON'T LIKE IT.

00:42.310 --> 00:44.178
DANNY, ARE YOU
EMBARRASSED OF ME?

00:44.212 --> 00:46.680
'CAUSE I'M, LIKE,
VERY SMART AND SUCCESSFUL,

00:46.714 --> 00:48.282
AND I'M HOT, BUT I, LIKE,
DON'T EVEN KNOW IT,

00:48.316 --> 00:49.583
WHICH MAKES ME EVEN HOTTER.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

00:49.617 --> 00:51.185
NO, I'M NOT
EMBARRASSED OF YOU.

00:51.219 --> 00:52.486
IT'S JUST THAT THIS IS NEW,

00:52.520 --> 00:55.256
AND I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TALKING
ABOUT US AND MAKING IT WEIRD.

00:55.289 --> 00:57.325
OKAY.
THIS, US--

00:57.358 --> 00:59.360
YOU'RE VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.

00:59.393 --> 01:00.361
REALLY?

01:00.394 --> 01:01.595
YES.

01:01.629 --> 01:03.564
OKAY, WE CAN DATE
IN SECRET, SURE.

01:03.597 --> 01:05.233
LET'S BE COOL.
I'LL BE COOL.

01:05.266 --> 01:08.469
(Mindy)
DATING IS FUN, BUT DATING
IN SECRET IS REALLY FUN.

01:08.502 --> 01:11.372
DANNY, CAN I GET
A SECOND OPINION ON THIS CHART?

01:11.405 --> 01:12.640
YEAH, SURE.

01:12.673 --> 01:15.709
I WAS LOOKING AT IT,
AND IT DOESN'T ADD UP.

01:15.743 --> 01:17.311
[The Cars' Just What I Needed]

01:17.345 --> 01:19.113
WHOA, WHOA, LET ME
READ THE CHART FIRST,

01:19.147 --> 01:20.281
AND THEN
I'LL GIVE YOU KISSES.

01:20.314 --> 01:22.450
THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY A LIE
TO GET YOU IN HERE.

01:22.483 --> 01:24.752
YOU SLY DOG.

01:24.785 --> 01:27.421
* I KIND OF LOSE MY MIND

01:27.455 --> 01:29.757
MINDY, I JUST GOT A CALL
FROM THE HOSPITAL.

01:29.790 --> 01:32.526
YOU GAVE A PATIENT THE WRONG
MEDICATION, AND SHE'S IN A COMA!

01:32.560 --> 01:35.196
[both gasp]
IN MY OFFICE, NOW!

01:35.229 --> 01:37.198
I KNOW A GUY
WHO CAN DISAPPEAR YOU.

01:37.231 --> 01:40.534
YOU'RE BAD AT THIS.

01:40.568 --> 01:43.271
* AND WASTING ALL MY TIME

01:43.304 --> 01:44.838
[elevator bell dings]

01:44.872 --> 01:47.341
* I GUESS YOU'RE JUST WHAT
I NEEDED, JUST WHAT I NEEDED *

01:47.375 --> 01:49.810
I SAW A HEADLINE
IN THE POST TODAY.

01:49.843 --> 01:51.212
[whispering]
IT SAID, "NEWS FLASH--

01:51.245 --> 01:52.546
YOU'RE STAYING
AT MY PLACE TONIGHT."

01:52.580 --> 01:54.182
[light slap]

01:54.215 --> 01:56.350
* YOU'RE JUST WHAT I NEEDED,
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH *

01:56.384 --> 01:59.187
(Mindy)
CLANDESTINE MAKE-OUTS,
SEXY GLANCES,

01:59.220 --> 02:00.321
FOOTSIE-ING
EACH OTHER'S BRAINS OUT,

02:00.354 --> 02:04.492
AND NOT TO BRAG, BUT I HAVEN'T
BEEN HOME IN THREE DAYS.

02:07.361 --> 02:08.662
GOD, I AM SUCH A SLOB.

02:08.696 --> 02:10.164
[gasps]
I HAVE BEEN ROBBED.

02:10.198 --> 02:12.433
[hip-hop music]

02:14.502 --> 02:17.271
HEY, JEREMY, CAN I GET
FRIDAY NIGHT OFF?

02:17.305 --> 02:20.508
I GOT A REAL HOT DATE
WITH AN E.T.P.C.

02:20.541 --> 02:22.210
WHAT'S AN E.T.P.C.?

02:22.243 --> 02:24.212
AN EAGER-TO-PLEASE CHUBSTER.

02:24.245 --> 02:26.247
THIS CHICK REQUIRES
NO WORK WHATSOEVER.

02:26.280 --> 02:28.916
I GO OVER THERE,
BRING HER SOME KETTLE CORN.

02:28.949 --> 02:31.252
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
WE'RE KNOCKING BOOTS, BABY.

02:31.285 --> 02:33.287
FRIDAY IS TECHNICALLY
MINDY'S NIGHT OFF.

02:33.321 --> 02:35.389
I DID TRY TO SWITCH HER
TO THURSDAY, REMEMBER,

02:35.423 --> 02:37.225
BUT SHE WROTE
THAT JEZEBEL ARTICLE

02:37.258 --> 02:38.826
ABOUT HOW
I "RAPED HER WEEKEND."

02:38.859 --> 02:41.195
I HAVE THIS BOX OF CONDOMS
THAT'S ABOUT TO EXPIRE.

02:41.229 --> 02:42.563
SPEAKING OF HOT DATES,

02:42.596 --> 02:45.266
I WAS TALKING TO YOUR GIRLFRIEND
THIS MORNING.

02:45.299 --> 02:47.268
WHAT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN
MY GIRLFRIEND?

02:47.301 --> 02:49.403
WHO TOLD YOU I HAD A GIRLFRIEND?
I DON'T HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

02:49.437 --> 02:50.904
OKAY, YES, I AM FRIENDS
WITH LOTS OF GIRLS,

02:50.938 --> 02:52.206
LIKE YOUR BEVERLYS
AND YOUR BETSYS,

02:52.240 --> 02:53.807
BUT I DON'T HAVE
A GIRLFRIEND.
WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.909
RELAX.
I'M TALKING ABOUT BROOKE.

02:55.943 --> 02:57.211
OH, BROOKE?
YEAH.

02:57.245 --> 02:58.246
BROOKE'S IN TOWN?
YES, SHE IS.

02:58.279 --> 02:59.247
RIGHT NOW SHE'S--

02:59.280 --> 03:01.849
IS THAT MY PEN, MAN?
UGH, GROSS.

03:01.882 --> 03:03.617
BITE YOUR NAILS
LIKE AN ADULT.

03:03.651 --> 03:04.752
WHO'S BROOKE?

03:04.785 --> 03:07.655
BROOKE IS A PHARMACEUTICAL REP.
SHE COMES ONCE A YEAR.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.957
LAST YEAR HER AND DANNY
HIT IT OFF, RATHER,

03:09.990 --> 03:12.393
AND THEY SHARED
A CORNISH HANDSHAKE.

03:12.426 --> 03:13.394
[whispering]
SEX.

03:13.427 --> 03:15.229
THAT'S GREAT, RIGHT?

03:15.263 --> 03:16.230
'CAUSE IF YOU WERE DATING
SOMEONE ELSE,

03:16.264 --> 03:17.731
THEN THAT WOULD BE
KIND OF UNCOMFORTABLE FOR YOU.

03:17.765 --> 03:20.701
UNCOMFORTABLE?
UNCOMFORTABLE?

03:20.734 --> 03:23.337
I AM THE MOST COMFORTABLE
I'VE EVER BEEN.

03:23.371 --> 03:25.439
OH, CLEARLY.
YOU SEEM LOOSE.

03:25.473 --> 03:27.641
(Jeremy)
THIS IS A NEW LOW.
ARE YOU WEARING SLEEP PAJAMAS?

03:27.675 --> 03:30.378
YES. YES, I AM WEARING
A NIGHTGOWN.

03:30.411 --> 03:31.879
FOR THE RECORD,
I STILL LOOK ADORABLE.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.046
I LOOK LIKE WENDY
FROM PETER PAN.

03:33.080 --> 03:35.683
AND I'M SORRY THAT I DIDN'T HAVE
A LOT OF CLOTHES OPTIONS,

03:35.716 --> 03:37.718
BECAUSE MY APARTMENT
WAS ROBBED.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.253
[both gasp]
DE BLASIO'S BEEN MAYOR

03:39.287 --> 03:40.521
FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS,

03:40.554 --> 03:41.989
AND NOW WE'RE SUDDENLY
LIVING IN BAGHDAD?

03:42.022 --> 03:43.424
YES.
HEY, WHAT WAS THE POINT OF ME

03:43.457 --> 03:45.326
CHOOSING TO LIVE
IN A GAY NEIGHBORHOOD, OKAY,

03:45.359 --> 03:47.328
IF I CAN'T LEAVE MY DOOR
WIDE OPEN?

03:47.361 --> 03:49.730
IT'S NOT FOR THE CULTURE
AND THE ART AND ALL THE PARADES.

03:49.763 --> 03:52.566
BE CAREFUL. CRIMINALS,
THEY CAN RETURN TO THEIR MARKS.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.803
I'VE BEEN MUGGED FIVE TIMES BY
THE SAME GANG OF TEENAGE GIRLS.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.371
MAYBE SOMEBODY
SHOULD STAY WITH YOU.

03:57.405 --> 03:58.539
WELL, THAT WOULD MAKE ME
FEEL SAFER.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.808
WELL, I'M NOT GONNA
MAKE YOU ASK TWICE.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.776
I'M IN.
I'M MOVING IN INDEFINITELY

04:02.810 --> 04:05.646
UNTIL YOU FEEL SAFE.
YES.

04:05.679 --> 04:06.880
OH, MORGAN,
THAT'S VERY SWEET OF YOU,

04:06.914 --> 04:09.383
BUT MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE WOULD BE
MORE OF AN APPROPRIATE CHOICE.

04:09.417 --> 04:10.384
WHAT ABOUT DANNY?

04:10.418 --> 04:12.886
COULD YOU STAY
WITH MINDY?

04:12.920 --> 04:15.789
ADOBE ACROBAT IS STILL
UPDATING IN HERE.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.057
I GOT TO TAKE CARE OF IT.

04:17.090 --> 04:19.527
I'M SORRY. I JUST SAID
I WOULD DO IT, OKAY?

04:19.560 --> 04:21.061
I-I-I--
WHAT'S UP?

04:21.094 --> 04:23.431
[whispering]
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

04:23.464 --> 04:24.432
[whispering]
I'M SORRY.

04:24.465 --> 04:25.399
IF YOU JUST ASKED ME
IN PRIVATE,

04:25.433 --> 04:26.967
MORGAN WOULDN'T BE SLEEPING
IN YOUR APARTMENT.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.469
I KNOW.
I'M SO USED TO EVERYBODY

04:28.502 --> 04:29.703
KNOWING EVERYTHING
ABOUT MY LIFE.

04:29.737 --> 04:32.072
MORGAN KNOWS MY MENSTRUAL CYCLE,
AND I FIND IT VERY HELPFUL.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.007
LOOK, MINDY, WE HAVE
SOMETHING REALLY NICE,

04:34.041 --> 04:36.076
AND I JUST DON'T WANT
THE PEANUT GALLERY IN THE OFFICE

04:36.109 --> 04:38.946
TO STICK THEIR NOSE IN
AND SCREW THINGS UP, OKAY?

04:38.979 --> 04:40.080
SO WE STILL COOL?

04:40.113 --> 04:43.317
[normal voice]
UH, LET THIS ANSWER
YOUR QUESTION.

04:43.351 --> 04:44.385
[beatboxing]

04:44.418 --> 04:47.321
OW!
OH, GOD, I BIT MY TONGUE.

04:47.355 --> 04:49.557
[sighs]
I DON'T KNOW WHY,
BUT I STILL WANT TO HIT IT.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.191
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU DON'T KNOW WHY?

04:51.224 --> 04:54.094
(Morgan)
DR. L, IF THOSE BURGLARS TRY TO
BREAK IN AGAIN, THEY'RE TOAST.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.496
I HAVE A PLAN.

04:55.529 --> 04:57.097
I'M GONNA GET THAT DOORKNOB
PIPING HOT.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.467
SO, IF THEY TOUCH IT, SSS!
BURNS THEIR HAND.

04:59.500 --> 05:02.836
THEY KICK THE DOOR OPEN, BOOM,
PAINT CAN RIGHT IN THE HEAD.

05:02.870 --> 05:03.671
KAPUT.

05:03.704 --> 05:05.373
DID YOU LEARN THIS
FROM HOME ALONE?

05:05.406 --> 05:06.407
I DIDN'T JUST WATCH
HOME ALONE.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.976
I ALSO WATCHED
SOME GROWN-UP FILMS.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.010
LIKE GROWN UPS?

05:10.043 --> 05:10.878
I WATCHED HOME ALONE
AND GROWN UPS.

05:10.911 --> 05:12.646
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF YOU'RE GONNA STAY HERE

05:12.680 --> 05:13.947
FOR A VERY SHORT AMOUNT
OF TIME,

05:13.981 --> 05:14.782
WE HAVE TO HAVE
SOME GROUND RULES.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.850
YES, WE ARE ROOMIES
WITH BENEFITS.

05:16.884 --> 05:18.719
WHAT?
ABSOLUTELY NOT!

05:18.752 --> 05:20.521
WHAT ABOUT FRIENDSHIP?

05:20.554 --> 05:22.956
OH, YES.
YES, YES.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.358
GO TO BED.
JUST DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING.

05:24.392 --> 05:25.359
I'M NOT EVEN HERE.

05:25.393 --> 05:26.760
YOU'RE THE BEST.

05:26.794 --> 05:28.996
YOU KNOW WHAT?
NOT A LOT OF GUYS WOULD DO THIS.

05:29.029 --> 05:31.098
NO ONE IS GONNA CUT YOU UP
INTO LITTLE PIECES TONIGHT.

05:31.131 --> 05:33.100
WHAT?
I'M GONNA KEEP YOU SAFE.

05:33.133 --> 05:34.535
GO, DON'T THINK ABOUT IT.

05:34.568 --> 05:36.036
HEY, YOU LIKE
EGGS BENEDICT?

05:36.069 --> 05:37.037
I DO.

05:37.070 --> 05:39.407
SO DO I.

05:39.440 --> 05:40.641
GOOD NIGHT.

05:40.674 --> 05:41.675
GOOD-BYE.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.644
REAL QUICK--
TUTORIAL ON THE REMOTE?

05:43.677 --> 05:46.580
WHICH BUTTON IS POW--
OKAY, I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

05:46.614 --> 05:49.850
[whispering]
ALL RIGHT, COME HERE, COME HERE.
I KNOW, I KNOW, SHH.

05:49.883 --> 05:53.053
LISTEN, YOU BEGGED ME
TO COME HERE, OKAY?

05:53.086 --> 05:56.089
SO DON'T SCREW THIS UP FOR ME,
YOU LITTLE SON OF A BITCH.

05:56.123 --> 05:59.393
[smooches]
OH, MY GOD, I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

06:00.561 --> 06:03.096
NO ACCIDENTS.
THAT GOES FOR BOTH OF US.

06:03.130 --> 06:04.698
FOR THE BATH.
[puppy growling]

06:04.732 --> 06:06.434
[normal voice]
WHAT DO YOU GOT THERE?

06:06.467 --> 06:07.968
WHAT IS THAT?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:08.001 --> 06:10.438
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
STOP IT. STOP IT.

06:10.471 --> 06:13.140
GET OUT OF THERE.
IT'S MINDY'S SCRUBS.

06:13.173 --> 06:15.576
THESE ARE MEN'S SCRUBS.

06:16.677 --> 06:18.979
"DR. PETER PRENTICE."

06:21.915 --> 06:24.452
MINDY AND PETER
ARE SLEEPING TOGETHER?

06:24.485 --> 06:25.886
AAH!

06:27.855 --> 06:29.590
MORGAN, I TOLD YOU.
I CAN'T PROMOTE YOU TO DOCTOR.

06:29.623 --> 06:30.658
THAT'S NOT EVEN WHY I'M HERE.
LISTEN TO ME, LISTEN, HEY.

06:30.691 --> 06:32.626
GOD, HOW DO I
PUT THIS DELICATELY?

06:32.660 --> 06:35.596
DR. LAHIRI AND DR. PRENTICE
ARE HAVING AN AFFAIR.

06:35.629 --> 06:38.131
[laughs]

06:38.165 --> 06:40.601
PETER AND MINDY?
THAT'S RIDICULOUS, MORGAN.

06:40.634 --> 06:42.836
NO, IT'S NOT. I FOUND
HIS SCRUBS AT HER APARTMENT.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.972
AND THEY'RE ALWAYS
HANGING OUT TOGETHER.

06:45.005 --> 06:47.675
SHE TOOK HIM TO THAT WEDDING,
EVEN THOUGH I'M HER BEST FRIEND.

06:47.708 --> 06:48.942
COME ON.
ALTHOUGH...

06:48.976 --> 06:51.078
YOU KNOW WHAT? PETER DID ASK
FOR THE SAME NIGHT OFF

06:51.111 --> 06:52.245
AS MINDY YESTERDAY.

06:52.279 --> 06:54.882
COME ON.
NO, NO, BUT HE WAS
GOING ON A DATE WITH AN E.T.P.

06:54.915 --> 06:58.051
OH, GOOD GOD,
MINDY'S THE CHUBSTER.
A CHUBSTER?

06:58.085 --> 06:59.319
COME ON, MAN!
I MEAN,

06:59.352 --> 07:02.490
HOW MANY CREEPS IN THIS BUILDING
IS SHE GONNA THROW HERSELF AT?

07:02.523 --> 07:04.825
CLIFF, DESLAURIER, YOU.

07:04.858 --> 07:05.926
YEAH.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.628
SHE'S REALLY BOTTOMING OUT,
ISN'T SHE?

07:07.661 --> 07:08.796
PETER'S AWFUL TO WOMEN.

07:08.829 --> 07:10.564
YEAH, HE BROKE UP
WITH A GIRL ONE TIME

07:10.598 --> 07:11.899
ON THE KISS CAM
AT A KNICKS GAME.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.834
UGH.
I GOT TO GO TALK TO HER.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.603
THIS IS
A ROOMMATE-TO-ROOMMATE THING.

07:15.636 --> 07:16.904
IT'S JUST BETTER OFF
IF I JUST GO

07:16.937 --> 07:18.606
AND I BURST INTO HER OFFICE
AND YELL AT HER.

07:18.639 --> 07:20.641
NO, NO, NO, NO, MORGAN.
THIS IS A PERSONAL MATTER,

07:20.674 --> 07:23.944
NOT A PROFESSIONAL ONE, OKAY?
IT'S NOT OUR PLACE TO INTERFERE.

07:23.977 --> 07:26.113
OKAY, WE HAVE TO LOCK
THIS SECRET AWAY

07:26.146 --> 07:29.783
ALONG WITH THE MEMORY OF DADDY

POOR RICH DR. L.

07:39.560 --> 07:42.062
DANNY. HI.

07:42.095 --> 07:43.631
I WAS HOPING
YOU'D BE HERE.

07:43.664 --> 07:45.733
BROOKE, IT'S REALLY--
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

07:45.766 --> 07:47.134
YOU TOO.

07:47.167 --> 07:48.569
I MEAN, YOU ALWAYS HAVE

07:48.602 --> 07:51.605
SUCH INTERESTING MEDICATIONS
TO TELL US ABOUT.

07:51.639 --> 07:53.941
I HAVE A NEW KIND OF NAPROXEN
THAT WILL BLOW YOUR MIND.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.509
OH, GOOD, GOOD.

07:55.543 --> 07:57.845
NAPROXEN'S GOOD
FOR TREATING

07:57.878 --> 07:58.946
THICK UTERINE WALLS.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.715
YOU ALWAYS REMEMBER THE DETAILS
OF MY PRESENTATIONS.

08:01.749 --> 08:02.983
OH, YOU BETTER BE CAREFUL.

08:03.016 --> 08:05.553
I HAVE A VERY CONTAGIOUS RASH
ON MY ARM.

08:05.586 --> 08:07.555
I DON'T WANT
TO GIVE IT TO YOU.
OH, OKAY.

08:07.588 --> 08:09.657
I'LL SEE YOU IN THERE,
RIGHT? OKAY.
OKAY, I'M GONNA SEE YOU--

08:09.690 --> 08:10.658
YEAH, I'M GONNA
CHECK YOU OUT IN THERE.

08:14.628 --> 08:16.163
[whispering]
HEY.

08:16.196 --> 08:18.566
SHE'S VERY PRETTY.

08:18.599 --> 08:19.867
REALLY?
I DON'T THINK SO.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.301
DID YOU GUYS HAVE,
LIKE, A LITTLE THING?

08:21.334 --> 08:24.705
BROOKE AND I ARE OLD NEWS, OKAY?
IT'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

08:24.738 --> 08:26.607
I'M NOT WORRIED.
I'M COOL, DANNY.

08:26.640 --> 08:27.808
ACTUALLY, I THINK
IT'S KIND OF HOT, YOU KNOW?

08:27.841 --> 08:29.076
SHE THINKS
SHE'S GONNA GET WITH YOU,

08:29.109 --> 08:30.177
BUT SECRETLY,
YOU'RE WITH ME.

08:30.210 --> 08:31.979
YEAH.
SO WHAT'S THE DEAL?

08:32.012 --> 08:33.581
DID YOU GET RID OF MORGAN

08:33.614 --> 08:34.848

08:34.882 --> 08:36.784
WHAT?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:36.817 --> 08:39.620
IS DR. C GONNA BE

08:39.653 --> 08:41.655
WELL...

08:41.689 --> 08:44.324

08:44.357 --> 08:47.861
DR. C AND DR. L...

08:47.895 --> 08:49.630
ARE THROWING A PARTY...

08:49.663 --> 08:51.231
[laughs]
AT MINDY'S HOUSE,

08:51.264 --> 08:52.766
AND EVERYONE'S INVITED.

08:52.800 --> 08:55.669
(Morgan)
A SURPRISE HOUSEWARMING PARTY
FOR ME? I KNEW IT!

08:55.703 --> 08:57.638
(Brooke)
WITH THIS NEW
BIRTH CONTROL PILL,

08:57.671 --> 08:59.740
ANY WOMAN CAN SYNC
HER MENSTRUAL CYCLE

08:59.773 --> 09:00.908
WITH HER FRIENDS

09:00.941 --> 09:03.711
OR A LIST
OF ENDORSED CELEBRITIES.

09:03.744 --> 09:05.312
I'M ON SANDY BULLOCK'S.

09:05.345 --> 09:07.615
THAT'S ALL.
FANTASTIC PRESENTATION, BROOKE.

09:07.648 --> 09:09.750
(Peter)
YEAH, YOU MADE ME WISH
I COULD MENSTRUATE.

09:09.783 --> 09:12.753
OH, DR. CASTELLANO,
I KNOW YOU ALWAYS HAVE

09:12.786 --> 09:14.254
A LOT OF FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS.

09:14.287 --> 09:17.991
I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER THEM
ONE-ON-ONE, MAYBE TONIGHT.

09:18.025 --> 09:19.993
TONIGHT?

09:20.027 --> 09:22.262
TONIGHT WE HAVE MINDY'S PARTY.
MAYBE SHE COULD JOIN?

09:22.295 --> 09:24.031
OH, WELL, YOU KNOW HOW MINDY IS
WITH THE VELVET ROPES.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.800
I MEAN, UNLESS YOU'RE
"BENJAMIN CUMBERBEACH,"

09:26.834 --> 09:28.969
YOU KNOW,
GOOD LUCK TO YOU.

09:29.002 --> 09:30.704
(Peter)
SINCE THE GUEST LIST
IS SO TIGHT,

09:30.738 --> 09:32.673
WELL, MAYBE YOU AND I
COULD HANG OUT.

09:32.706 --> 09:35.643
YEAH,
LET ME THINK ABOUT THAT.

09:35.676 --> 09:36.977
PETER,
YOU'RE SEEING SOMEONE.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.612
THE CHUBSTER?
YEAH.

09:38.646 --> 09:39.747
IT'S JUST A HOOK-UP THING.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.214
IT'S NOT A "LIGHTS ON"
SITUATION.

09:41.248 --> 09:42.683
UH, BROOKE.
WHAT?

09:42.716 --> 09:44.852
HMM?
I THINK WHAT DANNY
WAS TRYING TO SAY

09:44.885 --> 09:46.353
WAS THAT MAYBE
HE'S SEEING SOMEONE

09:46.386 --> 09:49.389
AND HE WANTS TO SPEND TIME
WITH HER AT THE PARTY.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.992
OH. IS THAT TRUE?
YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?

09:58.298 --> 09:59.266
NOPE.

09:59.299 --> 10:00.668
HE'S FINE.
YEAH, NO GIRLFRIEND.

10:00.701 --> 10:01.669
HE'S FREE.

10:01.702 --> 10:02.903
GREAT.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.672
I'LL SEE YOU THERE.

10:04.705 --> 10:08.141
WELL, EVERYONE
WILL BE SEEING EVERYONE.

10:09.409 --> 10:12.412
(both)
YOU'RE DISGUSTING.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.247
(Morgan)
OH, MY GOD, I'M FREAKING OUT!

10:14.281 --> 10:16.283
WHAT IF NO ONE SHOWS UP?
I'LL NEVER LIVE IT DOWN.

10:16.316 --> 10:17.417
[cell phone chimes]

10:17.450 --> 10:19.119
ALL RIGHT, WELL, I ALREADY
WENT OUT AND GOT ALL NEW FOOD,

10:19.152 --> 10:20.654
'CAUSE I ATE
ALL THE OTHER FOOD.

10:20.688 --> 10:21.955
HEY, HOW DO I LOOK?

10:21.989 --> 10:23.223
[cell phone chimes]

10:23.256 --> 10:25.125
AW.
YOU LIKE IT?

10:25.158 --> 10:26.426
I FEEL LIKE
I'M BURSTING IN IT.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.428
WHAT A DWEEB.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.330
ARE YOU TEXTING
DR. PRENTICE?

10:30.363 --> 10:31.699
WHAT? NO.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.133
OKAY.

10:33.166 --> 10:34.768
DOES THIS LOOK OKAY
FROM THE BACK?

10:34.802 --> 10:35.936
'CAUSE I FEEL LIKE
LITTLE POCKETS OF FAT

10:35.969 --> 10:37.170
ARE SHOOTING OUT
FROM THE SIDE OF THE VEST.

10:37.204 --> 10:38.806
DO YOU HAVE
A DIFFERENT VEST?

10:38.839 --> 10:40.240
NO, I DON'T HAVE
A DIFFERENT VEST!

10:40.273 --> 10:41.909
I'M NOT A HEDGE FUNDER.

10:41.942 --> 10:44.111
* I STEPPED UP IN HERE
LIKE I'M KILLING 'EM ALL *

10:44.144 --> 10:46.246
HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

10:46.279 --> 10:47.748
YOU CAN TAKE
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

10:47.781 --> 10:49.282
HI!
YOU LOOK LIKE A LITTLE BEAR CUB.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.450
LET ME GET THESE BAD BOYS
IN HERE.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.953
MORGAN, THAT'S VERY NICE.
YEAH, AFTER YOU.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.822
HEY, HOW MANY PEOPLE
CAN SPEND THE NIGHT HERE?

10:54.855 --> 10:56.089
'CAUSE I TOLD EVERYBODY
THEY COULD.

10:56.123 --> 10:57.124
NONE CAN.
NO ONE CAN. NO.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.391
ZERO? OKAY.
YEAH.

10:58.425 --> 10:59.827
HAVE YOU SEEN DANNY?

10:59.860 --> 11:01.228
YEAH,
HE'S IN MY BEDROOM.

11:01.261 --> 11:02.796
WAIT.
THE LIVING ROOM?

11:02.830 --> 11:03.997
EH...

11:04.031 --> 11:05.465
OKAY, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO CALL IT THAT.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.735
I SLEEP THERE,
SO A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH.

11:07.768 --> 11:08.836
HEY.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.003
HEY.

11:10.037 --> 11:12.339
GREAT TIE.

11:12.372 --> 11:14.407
SO WHEN CAN WE LEAVE
THIS LAME PARTY?

11:14.441 --> 11:17.310
* THERE'S NO HYPE,
I LOOK NICE IN MY NIKES *

11:17.344 --> 11:18.445
HEY, BROOKE!
OH, HI.

11:18.478 --> 11:20.180
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
IN MY HOUSE?

11:20.213 --> 11:21.348
DANNY INVITED ME.

11:21.381 --> 11:22.716
HMM.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.718
OH, EVERYONE
INVITED EVERYONE.

11:24.752 --> 11:27.220
NO, REMEMBER, YOU ASKED ME
TO COME SPECIFICALLY.

11:27.254 --> 11:28.255
IT WAS LIKE A DATE.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.457
IT WAS A--OH, I DON'T--
I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS.

11:30.490 --> 11:32.826
IT WAS, LIKE, A BIG, BIG GROUP--
GROUP THING.

11:32.860 --> 11:34.327
I DON'T KNOW THAT DYNAMIC.

11:34.361 --> 11:37.831
HEARD IT'S GONNA SNOW
TOMORROW...

11:37.865 --> 11:39.132
IN APRIL.

11:39.166 --> 11:40.000
[laughs]
OH, MY GOD.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.501
DO YOU REMEMBER
THAT BLIZZARD LAST YEAR,

11:41.534 --> 11:42.870
AND WE DIDN'T LEAVE
YOUR APARTMENT

11:42.903 --> 11:43.971
FOR TWO DAYS?

11:44.004 --> 11:45.438
UH, I DON'T--
YOU DO.

11:45.472 --> 11:47.207
[gasps] OH!
OH, MY GOD.
OH, GOD.

11:50.243 --> 11:51.211
(Morgan)
NO ONE FREAK OUT--SOME GLASS
IN THE FOOD, NO BIG DEAL.

11:51.244 --> 11:52.145
YOU OKAY?
ARE YOU OKAY?

11:52.179 --> 11:54.882
I HAVE--I HAVE NO FEELINGS
IN MY HANDS...

11:54.915 --> 11:56.750
OR IN MY HEART.

11:56.784 --> 11:59.086
(Brooke)
SO WHAT'S NEW WITH YOU,
DR. LAHIRI?

11:59.119 --> 12:00.120
YOU SEEING ANYBODY?

12:00.153 --> 12:01.889
I'M NOT SEEING ANYBODY.
OH.

12:01.922 --> 12:05.092
I AM SINGLE, BECAUSE
MY BOYFRIEND WAS DECAPITATED.

12:05.125 --> 12:06.259
HE WAS WHAT?

12:06.293 --> 12:07.828
HE WAS ACTING LIKE A JERK,
AND THEN SOMEONE

12:07.861 --> 12:10.063
JUST TOOK A SCIMITAR
AND CUT HIS HEAD RIGHT OFF.

12:10.097 --> 12:12.065
SO NICE TO SEE YOU.

12:12.099 --> 12:14.001
I'M GONNA GO DRINK ALONE
IN MY BEDROOM,

12:14.034 --> 12:15.402
SO HAVE A GREAT NIGHT.
OKAY.

12:15.435 --> 12:16.469
BEV, I'M GONNA GRAB THIS
FROM YOU.

12:16.503 --> 12:18.071
THANK YOU, BEV.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.973
HEY, DANNY,
HAVE YOU SEEN

12:20.007 --> 12:21.541
SOME OF THE WEIRD FEMINIST ART
IN MINDY'S APART--

12:21.574 --> 12:23.543
WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG
WITH YOU, MAN?

12:23.576 --> 12:26.346
YOU'RE SKEEVING EVEN ME OUT.
JUST TELL EVERYBODY ABOUT MINDY.

12:26.379 --> 12:28.882
LOOK, I JUST--I NEED--
I NEED TO TAKE MY TIME.

12:28.916 --> 12:29.883
JUST TELL EVERYBODY.

12:29.917 --> 12:30.951
NO, IT'S PRIVATE.

12:30.984 --> 12:32.052
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
IT'S PRIVATE?

12:32.085 --> 12:33.353
EVERYBODY KNOWS EVERYBODY'S
BUSINESS AROUND HERE.

12:33.386 --> 12:35.055
I DON'T WANT ANYONE
TO KNOW MINE, OKAY?

12:35.088 --> 12:37.891
JUST LEAVE IT LIKE THAT,
THANK YOU.

12:37.925 --> 12:39.426
WHOA, WHOA, OVER THERE.
LOOK, LOOK.

12:39.459 --> 12:40.427
[hip-hop music]

12:40.460 --> 12:42.062
[knocking]

12:42.095 --> 12:45.098
HEY.

12:45.132 --> 12:47.434
MINDY?
MIN, WHERE ARE YOU?

12:47.467 --> 12:49.002
MINDY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:49.036 --> 12:50.971
I'M SMOKING ONE OF
DANNY'S CIGARETTES TO BE COOL.

12:51.004 --> 12:52.405
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.
STOP IT!

12:52.439 --> 12:53.573
[mumbles]
STOP IT.

12:53.606 --> 12:54.942
IT DOESN'T MAKE YOU COOL.

12:54.975 --> 12:56.476
DON'T TAKE AWAY MY CIGARETTES!
I LOVE THEM.

12:56.509 --> 12:58.211
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
UGH.

12:58.245 --> 12:59.246
CAN THEY BE
MORE DISRESPECTFUL?

12:59.279 --> 13:01.248
DRAGGING PETER IN HER BEDROOM
FOR MEANINGLESS SEX

13:01.281 --> 13:03.083
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PARTY,
IN MY HOME?

13:03.116 --> 13:04.251
WELL, MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT,
MORGAN.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.153
MAYBE WE SHOULD STEP IN.

13:06.186 --> 13:07.354
LOOK, I SAW WHAT WAS GOING
ON OUT THERE.

13:07.387 --> 13:09.122
DANNY'S BEING A REAL TOOL.

13:09.156 --> 13:11.892
WHY DOES HE WANT TO KEEP
OUR RELATIONSHIP A SECRET?

13:11.925 --> 13:14.361
I'D BE SO EXCITED TO TELL
EVERYONE THAT WE WERE DATING.

13:14.394 --> 13:16.263
I WISH YOU WOULD TELL EVERYONE
YOU WERE DATING.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.899
THEN I COULD MAKE FUN
OF YOU TWO IN PUBLIC.

13:18.932 --> 13:20.868
MAYBE IF I LOOKED
MORE LIKE BROOKE.

13:20.901 --> 13:22.903
IS DANNY EMBARRASSED
BY ME, PETER?

13:22.936 --> 13:24.004
[sighs]

13:24.037 --> 13:25.272
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG
WITH ME?

13:25.305 --> 13:27.875
COME ON, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH YOU.

13:27.908 --> 13:31.078
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW WHY GUYS
ARE SHADY ABOUT THIS STUFF.

13:31.111 --> 13:32.312
THEY DON'T LIKE
TO GO PUBLIC SOMETIMES

13:32.345 --> 13:33.847
UNLESS THEY FEEL
LIKE THERE'S A REAL CHANCE

13:33.881 --> 13:34.848
THEY'LL LOSE THEIR GIRL.

13:34.882 --> 13:36.850
SHOULD I FAKE
MY OWN KIDNAPPING?

13:36.884 --> 13:39.252
I DID THAT ONCE TO TRY
TO GET OUT OF A FUN RUN.

13:39.286 --> 13:41.188
LOOK, THERE'S THIS CHICK
THAT I'VE BEEN MACKING ON

13:41.221 --> 13:43.156
A MONTH OR SO,
ON THE D.L.,

13:43.190 --> 13:45.325
AND EVERY TIME WE GO
TO HAVE THE GIRLFRIEND TALK,

13:45.358 --> 13:47.194
I TELL HER I HAVE TO GO
TO THE CAN,

13:47.227 --> 13:49.096
AND THEN I FLAT OUT
DO NOT COME BACK.

13:49.129 --> 13:50.030
OH, MY GOD!

13:50.063 --> 13:52.866
BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT
IF I EVER THOUGHT

13:52.900 --> 13:54.567
EVEN FOR A SECOND
THAT ANOTHER DUDE

13:54.601 --> 13:56.369
WAS INTERESTED IN HER,
I WOULD LOCK IT DOWN.

13:56.403 --> 13:59.940
START CALLING HER LINDSAY
IN FRONT OF MY FRIENDS.

13:59.973 --> 14:01.341
LISA?
BUT...

14:01.374 --> 14:04.144
PETER,
THERE IS NO OTHER GUY,

14:04.177 --> 14:08.248
UNLESS YOU COUNT
PRINCE FROG.

14:08.281 --> 14:10.050
STOP IT.
OW, MY BATWING!

14:10.083 --> 14:12.419
YOU DO HAVE OTHER DUDES,
ONE IN PARTICULAR.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.154
WHO?

14:14.187 --> 14:15.088
ME.

14:15.122 --> 14:17.157
ALL RIGHT, WHAT ARE WE
WORKING WITH HERE?

14:17.190 --> 14:19.226
ALL RIGHT, WE GOT
TO SLUT YOU UP A BIT.

14:19.259 --> 14:22.262
OKAY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:22.295 --> 14:23.263
THERE WE GO,
THAT'S GREAT.

14:23.296 --> 14:25.265
I'M TRYING TO MAKE HIM THINK
WE'RE UP TO NO GOOD.

14:25.298 --> 14:26.266
OH, COME ON, PETER,

14:26.299 --> 14:28.001
DANNY'S NEVER GONNA THINK
WE'RE MESSING AROUND.

14:28.035 --> 14:29.169
IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.
IT'S ABOUT PERCEPTION.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.938
IF I SAW MY GIRLFRIEND
GO INTO A BATHROOM

14:30.971 --> 14:32.239
WITH ANDY COHEN,
I'D FREAK OUT.

14:32.272 --> 14:33.606
THIS IS WHAT
I WANT YOU TO DO--

14:33.640 --> 14:35.242
I WANT YOU TO GIGGLE
LIKE A LITTLE GIRL.

14:35.275 --> 14:36.409
[chuckles awkwardly]

14:36.443 --> 14:38.411
LIKE A--LIKE A HUMAN GIRL.

14:38.445 --> 14:40.280

I'M GONNA GAG, BUT WE'RE GONNA

15:17.250 --> 15:18.685
MAKE IT LOOK SEXY, OKAY?

15:18.718 --> 15:21.288
SHE'S ACTING LIKE A WOMAN'S
ONLY JOB IS TO SERVE A MAN.

15:21.321 --> 15:22.655
WHAT IS IT, 2008?

15:22.689 --> 15:25.192
NOTHING'S GOING ON THERE.
IT'S FRIENDSHIP.

15:25.225 --> 15:26.994
YEAH, THAT'S WHY
I'M ALL TURNED ON,

15:27.027 --> 15:28.128

15:37.537 --> 15:39.139
COME SIT ON MY LAP.

15:39.172 --> 15:40.273
ARE YOU SURE YOU MEAN ME?
THERE'S, LIKE,

15:40.307 --> 15:42.175
A LOT OF OTHER WOMEN HERE
WHO ARE A LOT SMALLER THAN ME.

15:42.209 --> 15:43.176
YES, MINDY.

15:43.210 --> 15:45.145

OKAY.

15:45.178 --> 15:47.580
YOU WANTED TO SPEAK TO ME?
YEAH, COME HERE.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.582
HEY, HEY, MINDY, CAN I--

15:49.616 --> 15:51.118

CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

15:51.151 --> 15:52.285
NO, WE'RE BUSY.
WE'RE BEING COOL.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.754
YOU TALK TO BROOKE.
YEAH, DANNY, BE COOL.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.589
HEY, WHAT'S THE DEAL?

15:56.623 --> 15:58.091
I EXTENDED MY VISIT
FOR THIS PARTY.

15:58.125 --> 15:58.992
I'M REALLY SORRY.

15:59.026 --> 16:02.062
I SHOULD'VE BEEN UP FRONT
WITH YOU, BUT...

16:02.095 --> 16:05.098
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,
I DO HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

16:05.132 --> 16:06.433
BUT YOU SHOULD
ENJOY THE CITY.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.301
I MEAN, PEOPLE SAY
THE STATUE OF LIBERTY IS CLICHE,

16:08.335 --> 16:10.270
BUT I GO SEE HER
EVERY WEEKEND.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.738
[laughing]
IT'S OKAY, DANNY.

16:11.771 --> 16:15.075
IF I KNOW YOU, YOU'LL BE SINGLE
THE NEXT TIME I'M IN TOWN.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.548
YOU'RE SITTING ON ME
LIKE A VENTRILOQUIST'S DUMMY.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.016
I FEEL SO WOODEN, YEAH.

16:23.050 --> 16:24.384
(Peter)
TURN AROUND. MAKE IT HOT.

16:24.417 --> 16:27.020
I--OKAY.
MY HIP FLEXORS ARE VERY BAD.

16:27.054 --> 16:29.022
IT'S OKAY. COME ON.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I THINK THIS IS SEXY.

16:29.056 --> 16:30.257
WE CAN DO THIS.

IS THIS LECTURE
REALLY NECESSARY?

16:34.927 --> 16:36.329
YOUR SEX LIFE
IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS...

16:36.363 --> 16:37.330
NO, IT IS NOT.

16:37.364 --> 16:38.765
BUT KEEPING TABS ON IT
IS MY HOBBY,

16:38.798 --> 16:40.800
AND I CAN'T JUST STAND HERE
AND LET YOU DATE

16:40.833 --> 16:43.570
SOME CREEP FROM OUR OFFICE
WHO TREATS YOU LIKE GARBAGE.

16:43.603 --> 16:45.305
I'M SORRY.
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.740
CAN'T YOU CORRESPOND
WITH PRISON CONVICTS

16:47.774 --> 16:48.808
LIKE NORMAL DESPERATE WOMEN?

16:48.841 --> 16:50.743
GUYS, I'M NOT THAT BAD.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.379
HE'S NOT THAT BAD.

16:52.412 --> 16:54.114
MM...
YEAH, YOU ESSENTIALLY
ARE AWFUL.

16:54.147 --> 16:56.516
WELL, I'M NOT THE ONE
THAT'S DATING MINDY.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.685
(Jeremy)
YEAH, WE KNOW YOU'RE NOT
DATING HER, PETER.

16:58.718 --> 16:59.619
YOU'RE USING HER.

16:59.652 --> 17:01.354
UGH.
YOU KNOW, AND MINDY

17:01.388 --> 17:04.657
DESERVES A MAN WHO WILL MAKE
AN HONEST CHUBSTER OUT OF HER.

17:04.691 --> 17:07.794
"CHUBSTER"?
EXQUEEZE-EZ MOI?

17:07.827 --> 17:09.396
YEAH, SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT
ABOUT YOU.

17:09.429 --> 17:10.797
YEAH, SOME PEOPLE.

17:10.830 --> 17:13.466
IT'S A DIFFERENT CHUBSTER.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.735
I, TOO, HAVE
A CONFESSION.

17:15.768 --> 17:20.440
I'M IN LOVE
WITH DR. CASTELLANO.

17:20.473 --> 17:23.143
MINDY, YOU KEEP ON DATING
THESE MEN IN OUR BUILDING.

17:23.176 --> 17:24.511
IT ALWAYS ENDS
IN DISASTER.

17:24.544 --> 17:25.812
(Jeremy)
YOU CAN'T EVEN TAKE THE STAIRS

17:25.845 --> 17:27.647
'CAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID
YOU'RE GONNA RUN INTO CLIFF.

17:27.680 --> 17:30.750
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU BREAK UP
WITH A DOCTOR IN OUR OFFICE?

17:30.783 --> 17:33.420
HE'S USING YOU
FOR YOUR PERFECT BODY

17:33.453 --> 17:37.590
AND YOUR COVERGIRL LOOKS,
AND YOU NEED TO DUMP THIS SCRUB.

17:37.624 --> 17:41.394
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, LOOK...

17:41.428 --> 17:43.263
THE TRUTH IS...

17:46.833 --> 17:49.769
MINDY AND...
[sighs]

17:49.802 --> 17:51.304
THE THING IS, MINDY--

17:51.338 --> 17:53.640
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
YOU KNOW, I HAVE A PROBLEM.

17:53.673 --> 17:56.209
I HAVE A PROBLEM.
I HAVE HIT ROCK BOTTOM.

17:56.243 --> 17:57.210
WHAT?
I'M SORRY.

17:57.244 --> 17:59.446
I AM A SEX MANIAC.

17:59.479 --> 18:01.748
I-I-I-I-I KNEW IT.
I KNEW IT.
THERE YOU GO.

18:01.781 --> 18:04.584
I'M GOING TO TAKE
A GOOD, HARD LOOK AT MY LIFE,

18:04.617 --> 18:06.253
AND I'D LOVE SOME PRIVACY.

18:06.286 --> 18:09.189
(Morgan)
NO, THANK YOU. I'M SORRY.
WE ALL--GUYS, I'M SORRY.

18:09.222 --> 18:09.989
IT'S BEEN A LONG NIGHT.

18:10.022 --> 18:10.957
I THINK MINDY AND I
REALLY JUST NEED

18:10.990 --> 18:13.793
TO UNWIND AND RELAX,
SO IF EVERYONE COULD LEAVE

18:13.826 --> 18:15.128
AND GIVE US OUR PRIVACY...

18:15.162 --> 18:16.796
(Morgan)
I'M GONNA GO TOO.

18:16.829 --> 18:19.799
I WANT YOU ALL OUT OF MY HOUSE,
INCLUDING ME.

18:19.832 --> 18:22.302
(Peter)
HEY, LISA, YEAH.
I WAS THINKING ABOUT YOU.

18:22.335 --> 18:24.571
ACTUALLY, I, UM--
I CAN'T COME OVER TONIGHT.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.706
[tires screech]
SORRY.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.641
BECAUSE I WAS HOPING MAYBE
I COULD TAKE YOU OUT TO DINNER

18:28.675 --> 18:31.644
TOMORROW NIGHT,
YOU KNOW, BEFORE WE DO IT.

18:32.745 --> 18:34.314
HEY.

18:34.347 --> 18:35.682
HEY, IS EVERYBODY GONE?

18:35.715 --> 18:39.752
YEAH, BEVERLY--SHE TOOK
ALL THE CANS AND THE BOTTLES.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.321
I HOPE THAT'S OKAY.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.690
I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS
ANYMORE.

18:43.723 --> 18:45.825
I DON'T WANT TO DATE
IN SECRET.

18:45.858 --> 18:48.595
I THINK WE SHOULD EITHER
DATE FOR REAL,

18:48.628 --> 18:50.530
OR WE SHOULD
JUST END THIS.

18:52.665 --> 18:55.302
OKAY, YEAH, I THINK...

18:56.769 --> 18:58.671
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE SHOULD CALL IT OFF.

NO, NO, DANNY.

19:01.908 --> 19:04.444

A FALSE ULTIMATUM.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.446
I READ IN A MAGAZINE
THAT'S HOW YOU GET A GUY TO--

19:06.479 --> 19:07.780
NO, I TAKE IT BACK.
I TAKE IT BACK.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.081
I DON'T WANT TO STOP.
OKAY, LISTEN.

19:09.115 --> 19:10.517
I DON'T WANT TO STOP DATING,
DANNY.
LISTEN, OKAY, PLEASE STOP.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.519
JUST LISTEN TO ME, OKAY?

19:19.826 --> 19:23.763

19:26.799 --> 19:31.471

IN MY LIFE.

19:33.440 --> 19:36.943

AND THIS--

19:36.976 --> 19:39.846

THIS IS GONNA--

NO, NO, NO, DON'T, DON'T.

WHAT I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.417
I DO. I DO.

19:44.451 --> 19:45.952
YOU DON'T WANT TO RISK
OUR GREAT FRIENDSHIP.

19:45.985 --> 19:47.554
IT'S A BUNCH OF GARBAGE.

19:50.257 --> 19:51.057
WHEN THEY WANT
TO GET OUT OF SOMETHING,

19:51.090 --> 19:52.792
BUT THEY STILL WANT
TO SEEM NICE.

19:52.825 --> 19:53.793
I--
[voice breaking]
DON'T TELL ME YOU WANT

19:53.826 --> 19:57.564
TO BE MY BEST FRIEND,
'CAUSE I HAVE FRIENDS.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.576
I MEAN, REALLY,
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN?

20:09.609 --> 20:10.810
YOU'RE GONNA GET ATTACHED
TO ME.

20:10.843 --> 20:12.445
YEAH.

20:12.479 --> 20:14.814
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA FIGHT MORE,
THEN WE'RE GONNA BREAK UP,

20:14.847 --> 20:16.949
AND--AND--AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA
GO WORK SOMEWHERE ELSE.

20:16.983 --> 20:19.686
I'M NOT GONNA SEE YOU.
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

20:19.719 --> 20:20.720
OR--
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

20:20.753 --> 20:22.789
NO, OR...

20:22.822 --> 20:26.926
OR WE FIGHT,
BUT WE MAKE UP,

20:26.959 --> 20:30.697
AND I CHANGE A LITTLE BIT,
AND YOU CHANGE A LOT.

20:30.730 --> 20:31.764

LOOK, I-I THINK
THE BEST THING FOR US TO DO...

20:51.451 --> 20:53.853
I-I THINK IT'S--I THINK
IT'S GOOD THAT WE STOP THIS NOW.

20:53.886 --> 20:54.787
I THINK YOU'LL SEE
THAT I'M RIGHT.

20:54.821 --> 20:56.823

THIS DECISION NOW?

20:56.856 --> 20:57.957

20:57.990 --> 21:01.761
WHY DID YOU KISS ME, DANNY?
