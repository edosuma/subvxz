♪♪

00:06.340 --> 00:07.873
I've never told
anybody this before.

00:07.875 --> 00:09.708
You can tell me anything.

00:09.710 --> 00:12.111
I have this dream...

00:12.112 --> 00:14.513
It's really personal
and I've always been scared of
how people would respond to it.

00:14.515 --> 00:17.416
I'm telling you,
when it comes to your dreams,
I'm the one that you tell.

00:18.953 --> 00:20.285
I want to be a Sherpa.

00:20.287 --> 00:21.854
Mmm, no, don't do that.

00:23.190 --> 00:24.957
Yeah, I'm glad
I told you.

00:26.394 --> 00:28.694
They're the people
who take you up
to Mount Everest, right?

00:28.696 --> 00:30.696
And that's what
I want to be.

00:30.698 --> 00:32.331
But not just
some regular...

00:32.333 --> 00:35.667
"Hi, I'm Evan your
friendly mountain guide."

00:35.669 --> 00:39.204
I want to help people find their
way to places they never thought
they could reach.

00:39.206 --> 00:40.305
(birds chirping)

00:40.307 --> 00:41.373
What's that, Sherpa?

00:41.375 --> 00:43.475
That's morning.

00:43.477 --> 00:46.178
What are you talking about?
It's the middle of the--

00:46.180 --> 00:48.580
Are you crazy?
Get back down!

00:49.650 --> 00:51.050
Shut your chirp hole!

00:52.253 --> 00:53.736
Have we been
talking all night?

00:53.737 --> 00:55.220
I had a wonderful time.
Can we do it again?

00:55.222 --> 00:58.090
No! No! We can't even
do it the first time.

00:58.092 --> 00:59.525
My parents are
going to kill me.

00:59.527 --> 01:01.260
They can never know.

01:01.262 --> 01:02.327
You can never know.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.066
You've been up all night!

01:07.068 --> 01:08.300
She gets this from you.

01:09.737 --> 01:10.936
How long have you
guys been there?

01:10.938 --> 01:12.538
We stayed up all
night talking, too.

01:12.540 --> 01:13.972
Wanted to see what
the big deal was.

01:15.176 --> 01:16.508
Was it a big deal?

01:16.510 --> 01:18.277
Yeah. I like him now.

01:21.115 --> 01:23.315
What about you, Riley?
Is it a big deal?

It was really great
talking to you, Evan,

02:22.109 --> 02:24.042
but I have to get
upstairs right now
before--

02:26.447 --> 02:27.779
She's wearing
the same clothes.

02:27.781 --> 02:28.914
Who's that?

02:30.417 --> 02:32.618
While we're wearing
new different clothes.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.019
Who's that?

02:34.021 --> 02:35.254
She looks sleepy to me.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.622
Yeah, that one there,
who is that?

02:36.624 --> 02:38.090
Ma-- Dad...

02:38.092 --> 02:39.525
You got caught, kid.

02:39.527 --> 02:40.926
You know what
helps though?

02:40.928 --> 02:42.027
Nothing.

02:43.931 --> 02:45.063
Yeah.

02:47.535 --> 02:50.202
Okay, this is
ridiculous.

02:50.204 --> 02:52.638
Are you really going
to make me explain myself?

02:52.640 --> 02:54.406
-What do you think? Yes.
-Yes.

02:55.442 --> 02:56.542
Okay, then fine.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.111
I have this boot on.

03:00.714 --> 03:02.514
I am hobbled.

03:03.784 --> 03:06.218
As a person
who is hobbled,

03:06.220 --> 03:07.452
all I can do is talk.

03:07.454 --> 03:09.321
I can't run...

03:09.323 --> 03:11.089
I can't hike.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.326
And you know what?

03:14.328 --> 03:16.094
This boot is fantastic.

03:17.731 --> 03:19.331
What do you want
to do today, Maya?

03:19.333 --> 03:21.233
It's not about today.
It's about last night.

03:22.503 --> 03:23.569
All we did was talk.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.572
Okay.

03:29.143 --> 03:30.409
Lucas, I'm not
allowed to talk?

03:31.378 --> 03:32.844
Sure you can.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.580
You can talk to whoever
you want, Riley.

03:37.651 --> 03:38.817
Maya...

03:38.819 --> 03:40.085
I'll take care of it.
It'll be fine.

03:41.021 --> 03:42.421
I'm really sorry, Riley.

03:43.524 --> 03:45.390
But I did really like
staying up with you
all night.

03:45.392 --> 03:48.026
Thank you, Evan,
but maybe we shouldn't
say that out loud.

03:48.028 --> 03:49.394
You're wearing
the same clothes.

03:50.598 --> 03:51.763
You look sleepy to me.

03:51.765 --> 03:53.465
Who's that?
That one there.
Who's that?

04:02.843 --> 04:04.509
Look...

04:04.511 --> 04:06.778
I know you lose your mind
over me in front
of the firelight,

04:06.780 --> 04:08.280
but is it cool
if I sit down?

04:11.252 --> 04:12.451
You can take
your chances.

04:13.921 --> 04:16.088
You know that Riley
was just talking
to that guy, right?

04:16.090 --> 04:18.858
I know. I saw.

04:18.859 --> 04:21.627
She's got that big, clunky boot
on, okay? She's probably have
trouble falling asleep anyway.

04:21.629 --> 04:23.428
So all she did was
stay up and talk
to some guy.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.597
-Would you stop
saying that?
-Why?

04:25.599 --> 04:27.432
Why does it bother you
that she talked to someone?

04:29.303 --> 04:31.069
Do you remember when
we all first met?

04:31.071 --> 04:32.571
In the subway.

04:32.573 --> 04:34.873
And then I came
into your school,

04:34.875 --> 04:36.775
and Riley and I tried
to be boyfriend
and girlfriend,

04:36.777 --> 04:38.710
but we weren't
ready for that.

04:38.712 --> 04:40.479
So then,
you and I tried,

04:40.481 --> 04:42.147
and you poured
a smoothie on my head.

04:43.083 --> 04:44.316
Best date ever.

04:46.287 --> 04:47.853
Why did you pour
a smoothie on my head?

04:56.764 --> 04:58.363
(inaudible)

05:03.237 --> 05:05.070
When do you start
to understand your
own feelings?

05:06.640 --> 05:09.441
Well, we just need some
road miles to begin
to understand who we are.

05:09.443 --> 05:11.543
How is it possible
that Maya and I
like the same boy?

05:15.616 --> 05:16.982
I'd be more surprised
if you didn't.

05:18.252 --> 05:20.252
Why?

05:20.253 --> 05:22.253
Look, it's not hard to notice
Maya's been going through some
stuff lately.

05:23.424 --> 05:25.691
Yeah. She hasn't been
herself for a while.

05:25.693 --> 05:28.060
Yeah. And why do
you think that is?

05:30.831 --> 05:32.264
Because she
became like me.

05:33.534 --> 05:36.968
I always wanted to be her
and then she became like me.

05:36.970 --> 05:39.104
Now why would
she do that?

05:39.106 --> 05:40.939
Huh?

05:40.941 --> 05:43.508
Why would someone give up
who they are to be more
like someone else?

05:43.510 --> 05:44.843
Could you just tell me?

05:46.180 --> 05:48.780
I mean, I've got
a pretty good guess.

05:48.782 --> 05:51.783
Look, you guys
are the best friends
I've ever seen.

05:54.121 --> 05:57.189
Okay? You love each other
so much, you want to share
each other's experiences.

05:58.292 --> 05:59.624
I do.

05:59.626 --> 06:02.394
Everything you do
is to protect each other.

06:03.630 --> 06:05.163
When she gave up
who she was,

06:05.165 --> 06:08.533
you went looking for her,
you got her back,
you protected her.

06:09.903 --> 06:13.038
Yeah, but why did she get
lost in the first place?

06:14.341 --> 06:17.342
Why did she want
to become like me?

06:17.344 --> 06:19.044
Why do we like
the same boy?

06:19.046 --> 06:21.279
You don't, Riley,
you don't.

06:22.750 --> 06:25.117
She's been trying
to protect you.

06:36.597 --> 06:37.729
What are you
protecting me from?

06:37.731 --> 06:39.164
Why did I pour
a smoothie on Lucas?

06:39.166 --> 06:40.599
Why'd you want
to be me, huh?

06:40.601 --> 06:43.335
I felt like I needed to make
sure what you were feeling.

06:43.337 --> 06:44.669
About what?

06:44.671 --> 06:47.606
I don't know. Okay?
All of a sudden
we're in high school.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.341
We're feeling things,
we're growing up.

06:49.343 --> 06:51.543
I just wanted to make sure
what you were feeling.

06:51.545 --> 06:52.844
You can't just ask me?

06:52.846 --> 06:54.679
Not about this
kind of stuff.

06:54.681 --> 06:57.115
-Why not?
-Because you don't even
know what you're feeling.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.717
We're letting boys
into our lives.

06:58.719 --> 07:01.420
How do I know if he's
the right guy for you.

07:01.422 --> 07:02.621
How do I know
if he's good enough?

07:04.191 --> 07:05.857
You're the only one
who's good enough for me.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.460
This we've always known.

07:22.242 --> 07:23.708
-We're going to talk
to each other?
-Yeah.

07:24.812 --> 07:27.045
So, have you chosen
between Riley and Maya?

07:27.047 --> 07:28.146
I did.

07:28.148 --> 07:29.381
Now I got
a question for you.

07:29.383 --> 07:30.449
-So who is it?
-No.

07:30.451 --> 07:32.250
-Come on, who?
-No!

07:32.252 --> 07:35.620
What does it mean that
Riley spent the whole night
talking to some other guy?

07:35.622 --> 07:38.457
It could mean that Riley's
not interested in you anymore.

07:38.459 --> 07:39.558
It could mean that?

07:39.560 --> 07:41.560
Boy, you are insecure
for a Western hero.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.931
Or it could mean that
she just enjoys talking
to someone.

07:45.933 --> 07:47.732
I don't like that
you know anything.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.837
I wonder what
you guys talked about.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.505
I told her what I wanted
to do with my life.

07:53.507 --> 07:55.774
Oh, no, she loves that.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.309
I've never told
anyone before.

07:57.311 --> 07:59.344
She loves that, too.

07:59.346 --> 08:01.346
-What did you tell her?
-I told her I wanted to be
a Sherpa.

08:01.348 --> 08:02.647
Oh, no,
don't do that.

08:04.785 --> 08:07.486
I like helping people get
to places they never thought
they could go.

08:07.488 --> 08:09.020
Is that a Sherpa
guide book?

08:09.022 --> 08:11.790
This? This is a game
we're going to play.

08:11.792 --> 08:13.692
We've had it behind
the counter for years.

08:13.694 --> 08:16.027
Yeah, I'm going to read you
come questions from this book.

08:16.029 --> 08:18.597
It's called the<i> Official Guide</i>
<i>to Who Belongs With Who.</i>

08:20.100 --> 08:21.867
The book's
gonna tell us?

08:21.869 --> 08:22.701
No!

08:26.840 --> 08:28.006
I remember that book.

08:29.877 --> 08:32.210
That book is evil.

08:33.714 --> 08:36.815
The first question is,
"if you could change
your mate

08:36.817 --> 08:38.850
"into one animal,
what would it be?"

08:38.852 --> 08:41.887
And the only answer is,
the falcon.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.155
How do you know that?

08:44.157 --> 08:45.757
Because I am the falcon.

08:50.163 --> 08:51.463
Of course, you are.

08:51.465 --> 08:53.832
-Let's play.
-Let's find out who
belongs with who?

08:53.834 --> 08:54.900
Don't do it.

08:54.902 --> 08:56.568
Nobody do it.

09:01.341 --> 09:03.475
No one ever listens
to the falcon.

09:09.316 --> 09:10.715
You all deserve
what you get.

09:16.823 --> 09:18.089
Question number one--

09:18.091 --> 09:20.725
If you could change your
mate into one animal--

09:20.727 --> 09:21.760
It's not even
the same question.

09:21.762 --> 09:22.827
Why not?

09:22.829 --> 09:24.729
Because this is
<i>Who Belongs With Who,</i>

09:24.731 --> 09:26.364
<i>The Next Generation.</i>

09:26.366 --> 09:27.832
This question's
for you guys.

09:27.834 --> 09:31.670
-Oh.
-The most important part
of any meaningful relationship

09:31.672 --> 09:33.505
is, A, romance--

09:33.507 --> 09:35.240
Yes, romance.

09:35.242 --> 09:36.875
Isn't that the whole
point of a relationship?

09:36.877 --> 09:39.678
It says any relationship,
it doesn't just mean
you guys and Lucas.

09:39.680 --> 09:42.514
Yeah, it also means
relationships with
your friends.

09:42.516 --> 09:44.950
So if the answer isn't
romance, then what else
you got?

09:45.919 --> 09:47.719
B, adventure.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.788
Yes, adventure.
Break the rules.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.923
You don't have to break
the rules to have an adventure.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.858
What do you have against
breaking the rules,
Ranger Rick?

09:53.860 --> 09:55.760
That's who he used to be, Maya.
Cost him a year of his life.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.095
I think maybe he's
learned something.

10:00.968 --> 10:02.133
Read the other choice.

10:02.135 --> 10:03.735
How do you know
there is one?

10:03.737 --> 10:05.637
In multiple choice
there are always the
answers that are close,

10:05.639 --> 10:08.740
but then there's the correct
answer and as soon as you
hear it, you know it's right.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.308
And I don't think
we've heard
the right answer yet,

10:10.310 --> 10:12.944
so I know the most meaningful
part of any relationship is C.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.279
One for us.
Next question.

10:15.248 --> 10:16.514
Can we please
hear what C is?

10:17.484 --> 10:19.484
C, conversation.

10:20.454 --> 10:21.653
Ding.

10:23.423 --> 10:26.591
-Even better.
I love these now.
-How come?

10:26.593 --> 10:29.961
Because Smackle and I have had
so many good conversations now
that I think she trusts me.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.630
-I do.
-I like these, too.

10:40.907 --> 10:44.909
So the most meaningful part
of a relationship is talking
to each other?

10:44.911 --> 10:47.812
And with the right person,
sometimes you can talk
all night.

10:51.585 --> 10:53.652
Yup, maybe so.

10:55.288 --> 10:57.522
Well, if y'all will
excuse me, I'm gonna

10:57.524 --> 10:59.991
go over there and maybe,
I don't know, kick a tree.

11:02.629 --> 11:05.030
Will y'all excuse me?
I'm going to go over there
and maybe, I don't know,

11:05.032 --> 11:06.231
save a tree.

11:10.771 --> 11:12.637
Question number two.

11:12.639 --> 11:14.205
How do you know
if you love somebody?

11:14.207 --> 11:17.008
You know what?
I'm through playing games,
I want to talk to you.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.276
-Who?
-Who?

11:24.017 --> 11:26.351
I just need to think.

11:26.353 --> 11:27.852
Yeah, I just need
to think.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.122
May I please
see that book?

11:31.124 --> 11:32.357
This book?

11:32.359 --> 11:33.892
Okay, what do you need
to see this book for?

11:33.894 --> 11:35.460
Smackle, distract him.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.002
"If you could change your mate
into one animal--"

11:44.004 --> 11:46.871
Is this the same book from when
Mister and Missus Matthews were
here last?

11:46.873 --> 11:48.740
-You were making up
the questions?
-Why would you do that?

11:48.742 --> 11:50.308
Hi.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.577
I'm Evan, your friendly
mountain guide.

11:52.579 --> 11:55.747
And I want to help people find
the way to places they never
thought they could reach before.

11:55.749 --> 11:57.315
How do you know
so much about us?

11:57.317 --> 11:59.517
I was talking with
Riley all night.

11:59.519 --> 12:02.887
You would think that for
one second we could talk
about her and me...

12:02.889 --> 12:05.056
but you guys were
all she wanted to
talk about.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.061
Tell me what
you know right now.

12:11.498 --> 12:13.431
I'm a lot younger
than my brothers
and sister.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.767
So they won't have
a relationship with
you either?

12:15.769 --> 12:17.736
So I spent a lot
of time just
watching them.

12:17.738 --> 12:19.070
So far we're still talking
about you and me.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.438
-Stop it.
-No.

12:22.375 --> 12:24.909
I've learned to be pretty
good at observing people.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.277
Understanding what's
going on with them.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.347
You sure you're
ready to hear this?

12:29.349 --> 12:30.381
Right now.

12:30.383 --> 12:31.816
-Even if it was bad for me?
-Right now.

12:33.286 --> 12:34.652
What I have observed
about you...

12:35.789 --> 12:37.655
is that you are the best friend
anyone could ever have.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.760
Maybe it's 'cause
your dad left.

12:41.762 --> 12:43.928
Maybe it's 'cause you
never felt that love...

12:43.930 --> 12:46.965
but it gave you
the greatest capacity
for love that I've ever seen.

12:51.204 --> 12:52.303
Say that again.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.473
Why, you didn't
understand it?

12:55.475 --> 12:57.442
No, I understood it.

12:57.444 --> 12:58.610
Say it again.

12:58.612 --> 13:00.478
Say it 50 times.
Say it in French.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.147
You heard me
the first time.

13:02.149 --> 13:03.815
I did.

13:03.817 --> 13:05.984
Thank you,
but you're wrong.

13:05.986 --> 13:08.286
It's Riley that's
the best friend that
you could ever have.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.654
Yeah.

13:10.791 --> 13:12.557
What I've also
noticed, Maya,

13:12.559 --> 13:14.826
is that you've cared about
Riley so much for so long,

13:14.828 --> 13:17.061
that the moment she decides
to care about somebody else--

13:17.063 --> 13:18.563
Lucas.

13:18.565 --> 13:20.131
You need to protect her.

13:21.067 --> 13:22.267
How?

13:22.269 --> 13:24.068
You needed to see
if she was safe with him.

13:24.070 --> 13:26.137
Yeah, well, how could
I possibly do that?

13:26.139 --> 13:28.006
Well, let's see,
all right?

13:28.008 --> 13:30.975
You lose yourself and become
like her so you could get to
know him like she knows him.

13:32.579 --> 13:35.146
What a great way to know
if he was good enough
for your best friend.

13:37.350 --> 13:38.416
I was protecting her?

13:39.486 --> 13:41.252
She would do
the same for you.

13:41.254 --> 13:43.822
She did.
She brought me back.

13:43.824 --> 13:45.623
And now that you're you?

13:45.625 --> 13:48.126
I don't like
Lucas like that.

13:48.128 --> 13:49.761
How do you know?

13:50.997 --> 13:53.498
I went out with him one time.
Poured a smoothie on his head.

13:54.701 --> 13:56.301
-In a cute, romantic way?
-No.

13:56.303 --> 13:59.103
In a, he's so nice I wanted
to mess him up, kind of way.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.473
He's perfect for Riley.

14:02.475 --> 14:06.144
I know, because when
you're Riley, it's hard
not to like him.

14:06.146 --> 14:07.946
That was the first thing
I found out.

14:07.948 --> 14:09.380
When you were Riley?

14:09.382 --> 14:11.983
Yes. But now I'm me.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.852
How do you feel now?

14:13.854 --> 14:17.989
I feel like...
if you know me at all...

14:17.991 --> 14:20.925
and you know the last thing
I would ever do is want
anything that was Riley's.

14:21.895 --> 14:23.027
Why?

14:24.064 --> 14:25.964
Because I love her.

14:25.966 --> 14:28.132
I always have
and she loves me.

14:28.134 --> 14:29.834
We would never take
from each other,

14:29.836 --> 14:31.803
and there's nothing
that could ever happen
to change that.

14:34.241 --> 14:35.206
Good.

14:36.676 --> 14:38.376
Good, you know,
that's a real adult
way of thinking.

14:40.247 --> 14:41.212
Thank you, Josh.

14:42.816 --> 14:44.482
Hey. Why is this
bad for you?

14:46.186 --> 14:48.887
That it isn't Lucas who
you like? That you remember
who you are now?

14:50.190 --> 14:53.892
That conversation
is the most important
part of any relationship,

14:53.894 --> 14:56.628
and that you and I just
had another amazing one?

15:00.267 --> 15:01.966
-Josh?
-What?

15:03.203 --> 15:05.670
Why have you let me
hold on to your hand
this entire time?

15:10.510 --> 15:12.143
I don't know.

15:13.747 --> 15:15.246
I don't know everything.

15:21.688 --> 15:24.622
Okay, Huckleberry,
Little golden
sunshine-head is right.

15:24.624 --> 15:28.226
This triangle needs to be put
out of its misery and there's
only one way to do it.

15:28.228 --> 15:29.427
-How?
-Well...

15:29.429 --> 15:31.062
We all know you
chose somebody.

15:31.064 --> 15:32.747
We all know what's
the right choice.

15:32.748 --> 15:34.431
And we know it's the only choice
that you could possibly make.

15:35.368 --> 15:37.201
-We do?
-Sure, we do.

15:37.203 --> 15:39.404
Because we know
you like both of us,

15:39.406 --> 15:42.807
but we also know there's only
one of us that makes your little
cowboy heart go clippity clop.

15:42.809 --> 15:45.310
You're right.
You said that right.
You said that completely right.

15:45.312 --> 15:46.611
And it's me.

15:48.148 --> 15:49.213
Uh--

15:51.418 --> 15:53.251
So it's you
and me forever?

15:53.253 --> 15:56.154
-Um--
-Also, I want you to stop
talking to that Riley girl.

15:56.156 --> 15:58.156
Maya--

15:58.158 --> 16:00.558
You can't hurt me,
can you?

16:00.560 --> 16:01.960
I can never hurt you.

16:03.263 --> 16:05.129
This is why you're
such a nice guy.

16:06.433 --> 16:08.700
This is why I really wish
I had a smoothie right now.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.838
I don't want
a nice guy?

16:13.840 --> 16:17.241
Yikes. Okay, Huckleberry,
if you care about me...

16:18.311 --> 16:19.210
here's what you do.

16:21.081 --> 16:23.348
Go find Riley...

16:23.350 --> 16:24.916
tell her you love her.

16:26.086 --> 16:27.919
-Love her?
-Just say it.
We like it.

16:31.758 --> 16:33.358
Thank you.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.326
What are friends for?

16:41.968 --> 16:44.335
What do you want?

16:44.337 --> 16:46.938
Who me? I was just
standing over there
watching that whole thing.

16:46.940 --> 16:48.806
Yeah, we get it.
You watch stuff.

16:48.808 --> 16:50.174
So what'd you think?

16:51.511 --> 16:52.744
I thought this...

16:56.316 --> 17:00.618
For me to ever think that
I don't need a friend like you
in the world,

17:00.620 --> 17:03.955
just 'cause I'm a little older,
that'd make me a lot less
mature than I want to be.

17:06.292 --> 17:08.326
You know, Boing...

17:08.328 --> 17:10.528
there are six weeks out of
the year between our birthdays

17:10.530 --> 17:12.497
when we're only
two years apart.

17:12.499 --> 17:15.233
Like, oh, I don't know,
right now, so...

17:15.235 --> 17:18.569
how about this? We get
to hold hands six weeks
out of the year.

17:18.571 --> 17:20.738
-I'll take it.
-We could do that.

17:21.741 --> 17:23.141
Or how about I like
my deal better?

17:24.544 --> 17:26.377
You once said you were
playing the long game.

17:27.347 --> 17:28.246
I like you, Josh.

17:30.350 --> 17:31.282
It's you I like.

17:34.254 --> 17:35.586
I like you, too.

17:38.425 --> 17:40.058
And I'd never want you
not to be in my life.

17:41.428 --> 17:43.528
No, how about
we try this?

17:43.530 --> 17:45.329
-Boyfriend and
girlfriend right now!
-No.

17:45.331 --> 17:46.764
Boyfriend and
girlfriend eventually.

17:49.402 --> 17:50.501
You're not saying no.

17:52.372 --> 17:53.938
You have to say
something.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.009
I'll play the long game.

17:59.712 --> 18:02.447
Live your life,
I'll live my life,
I know you're out there...

18:04.384 --> 18:05.650
and I'm out there, too.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.453
That's your deal?

18:08.455 --> 18:09.787
That's my deal.

18:12.292 --> 18:13.458
Someday?

18:15.228 --> 18:16.327
Someday.

18:20.934 --> 18:22.366
-Let go.
-Someday.

18:26.473 --> 18:29.040
See, when you bring people
to a place they've never
been before,

18:29.042 --> 18:31.476
and they realize
they've finally made it,

18:31.478 --> 18:34.278
it's this look on their faces
that makes it all worthwhile.

18:34.280 --> 18:38.449
-How do they look?
-Well, they look like the whole
world has new possibilities.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.284
It's a certain look.
I know it when I see it.

18:41.387 --> 18:43.154
I think you'll make
a great Sherpa one day.

18:44.157 --> 18:45.289
Thank you.

19:06.346 --> 19:08.880
My favorite thing in this world
is when you talk to me.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.550
It is?

19:12.551 --> 19:14.618
It's okay for you to talk
to whoever you want, Riley,

19:14.621 --> 19:16.521
you know why?
Because...

19:16.523 --> 19:20.324
I am a secure
Western hero.

19:22.095 --> 19:24.195
Yes. Yes, you are.

19:24.197 --> 19:26.364
But the important talks...

19:26.366 --> 19:30.635
the ones that we're going
to think about
and always remember.

19:30.637 --> 19:32.770
Can those just be
between you and me?

19:34.140 --> 19:36.674
Well, I don't know, Lucas.

19:36.676 --> 19:38.543
How could that happen?

19:40.480 --> 19:44.382
Well, I was thinking
that if we were...

19:44.384 --> 19:46.551
together a little more...

19:46.553 --> 19:49.987
that you would only talk
to other people a little bit,

19:49.989 --> 19:53.224
and you would
talk to me... a lot.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.028
-That's what you
were thinking?
-Yeah.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.065
I think about it
all the time.

20:04.237 --> 20:07.505
So, if there was some
dance or something,

20:07.507 --> 20:08.706
maybe we could
go together?

20:08.708 --> 20:09.941
Yeah.

20:11.177 --> 20:13.177
Without even
asking each other.

20:13.179 --> 20:15.680
And if you went out
and got a sandwich

20:15.682 --> 20:18.216
or something, maybe
you would think
to get me one, too?

20:20.520 --> 20:22.220
And a drink.

20:22.222 --> 20:23.554
And cake.

20:25.525 --> 20:27.925
So, you've been thinking
about this, too?

20:29.028 --> 20:30.161
Yeah.

20:31.264 --> 20:32.897
Yeah, I think about it
all the time.

20:36.035 --> 20:39.604
But we always said that
the most important thing
was that nobody got hurt.

20:41.341 --> 20:42.607
Will Maya be okay?

20:43.543 --> 20:45.309
She's the one
who sent me to you.

20:46.779 --> 20:48.512
So this is our moment?

20:48.514 --> 20:49.847
Mmm-hmm.

20:49.849 --> 20:51.682
I promise to you...

20:51.684 --> 20:53.417
that my moment
would be my moment.

20:55.021 --> 20:56.254
This is it.

20:59.092 --> 21:00.791
Ah, I got you this.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.127
(shouting) Maya!

21:05.565 --> 21:06.631
It's a jellybean.

21:06.633 --> 21:08.332
Stay where you are!

21:09.736 --> 21:11.002
What does it mean?

21:12.105 --> 21:14.739
We put these jellybeans
on a scale...

21:14.741 --> 21:17.808
when I was trying to think
about all of the things
that I like about you,

21:17.810 --> 21:20.011
and I was trying
to decide what
I needed to do.

21:23.216 --> 21:24.548
It means you, Riley.

21:26.486 --> 21:30.621
I choose you,
and I really want
you to choose me.

21:34.327 --> 21:35.459
I do.

21:40.433 --> 21:41.499
I always did.

21:43.569 --> 21:45.603
I have something
for you, too.

21:45.605 --> 21:46.837
You do?

21:53.613 --> 21:55.846
We have this
one little life...

21:55.848 --> 21:58.015
and for a lot of it,

21:58.017 --> 21:59.550
we just blow
around in the wind.

22:01.621 --> 22:03.654
But if we're lucky...

22:03.656 --> 22:05.623
and we believe that

22:05.625 --> 22:07.258
life knows
what's best for us...

22:08.961 --> 22:10.895
sometimes we land on
the right someone
to talk to.

22:16.869 --> 22:18.669
I'm glad I fell
into your lap.

22:21.341 --> 22:22.606
So am I.

22:25.511 --> 22:27.545
That look.

22:27.547 --> 22:29.547
That look there.

22:29.549 --> 22:31.248
Sherpa.

22:37.523 --> 22:39.557
You couldn't get them
to pack their own bags?

22:39.559 --> 22:43.127
Well, every time I came down
and tried, they were so adorable
I just couldn't do it.

22:43.129 --> 22:46.130
I'm really glad
we came here this weekend.
It was a good time.

22:46.132 --> 22:47.465
You can come here
anytime you want.

22:48.568 --> 22:50.034
Mr. Matthews...

22:50.036 --> 22:52.269
-Yes?
-My mother says hello.

22:59.479 --> 23:00.578
I'm never
coming here again.

23:03.716 --> 23:04.882
Nature!

23:15.094 --> 23:16.260
You and Lucas.

23:16.262 --> 23:17.695
We're going to try.

23:17.697 --> 23:19.730
My first boyfriend.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.065
Because you made
sure it was okay.

23:21.067 --> 23:22.600
You would do
the same for me.

23:22.602 --> 23:24.368
I hope I would.

23:24.370 --> 23:27.705
Riles, you stepped back
the minute you thought
I had feelings for him.

23:27.707 --> 23:30.408
You were ready to give him
up for me no matter what
you felt.

23:30.410 --> 23:32.443
I would do anything
for you.

23:32.445 --> 23:34.078
I know.

23:35.715 --> 23:37.681
So, you and Josh?

23:38.718 --> 23:39.950
Someday.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.354
Who knows?
Who knows anything?

23:45.091 --> 23:47.057
I do.

23:47.059 --> 23:49.627
I know that if you're
lucky in this life,

23:49.629 --> 23:51.695
you get
an extraordinary
relationship.

23:53.733 --> 23:55.466
My mother
and my father

23:55.468 --> 23:59.203
met each other very early
and stayed together for
the rest of their lives.

24:01.240 --> 24:03.474
Our first
boyfriends, Maya.

24:05.144 --> 24:07.044
Who knows how long
that's going to last?

24:08.381 --> 24:10.815
We're going to meet new
people all of the time.

24:13.453 --> 24:16.320
But if there's one thing
that I know for sure
in my life...

24:17.623 --> 24:21.659
it's that you are
my extraordinary
relationship, Maya.

24:26.399 --> 24:27.765
Thunder.

24:27.767 --> 24:28.732
Lightning.

24:29.969 --> 24:31.135
Both: Forever.
