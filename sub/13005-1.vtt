You're not going back
to the Fern School next year.

52:46.454 --> 52:49.331
-They don't want you anymore.
-Okay.

52:50.250 --> 52:52.459
I'm gonna call Miss Fern
and have her over here.

52:52.627 --> 52:55.004
No, no, no! She'll think I lied to her!

52:55.172 --> 53:00.134
-You did lie to her.
-But not to you, Mother. Not to you.

53:01.428 --> 53:02.469
Oh....

53:10.228 --> 53:12.730
Hello, Fern School?

53:13.440 --> 53:16.066
Miss Claudia Fern, please.

53:17.611 --> 53:21.906
No. No message.

53:25.076 --> 53:26.619
Well....

53:26.786 --> 53:28.704
She isn't home yet.

53:29.247 --> 53:31.957
Mother, what are you gonna do
with the medal?

53:32.125 --> 53:33.667
It's really mine.

53:36.755 --> 53:39.965
Rhoda, come here to me.

53:49.935 --> 53:52.853
It can't be true.

53:53.021 --> 53:56.023
It can't be true.

53:58.360 --> 54:02.238
Fifty, $0.75, $5, and $5 are $10.
Thank you very much, colonel.

54:02.405 --> 54:05.658
-And here's the card to go in it.
-Yes, colonel.

54:08.495 --> 54:12.873
-None of it will get broken in the mailing?
-No, it'll be packed in excelsior for that.

54:13.041 --> 54:14.959
Good. Thank you.

54:22.634 --> 54:24.176
Look, a tea set.

54:24.344 --> 54:27.721
Oh, I guess we know a daddy
who loves somebody, all right.

54:27.889 --> 54:29.598
What does the card say?

54:29.766 --> 54:34.103
"For no reason, except she's
the sweetest little girl in the world. Daddy."

54:34.271 --> 54:37.356
Oh, look, it's got a pot and everything.

54:37.524 --> 54:40.734
Mother, could I take it out
under the arbor for a while?

54:40.902 --> 54:43.362
I wanna pretend
I'm giving a garden party.

54:43.530 --> 54:47.866
Yes, dear. Oh, and, by the way, unpack
it while you're out there, will you, dear?

54:48.034 --> 54:51.704
Because this excelsior is just
getting over everything.

54:51.871 --> 54:55.291
Oh, and don't put it down the incinerator,
because it's much too large.

54:55.458 --> 54:58.085
Leave it out by the cellar doors
for Leroy to dispose of.

54:58.253 --> 54:59.962
-Yes, Mother.
-A garden party.

55:00.130 --> 55:02.047
Isn't she the perfect old-fashioned girl?

55:02.215 --> 55:05.551
By the way, do you know
you're having your supper with me tonight?

55:05.719 --> 55:08.178
Really, Aunt Monica?
Is it a special reason?

55:08.346 --> 55:11.390
Oh, no. Just that I've invited
Reginald Tasker for cocktails.

55:11.558 --> 55:13.809
You remember, Rhoda,
Granddaddy's coming tonight.

55:13.977 --> 55:17.688
I'm going to have my dinner with him.
And that's much too late for you to eat.

55:17.856 --> 55:22.026
-Wasn't that nice of Aunt Monica?
-Of course. Aunt Monica's sweet.

55:22.193 --> 55:25.446
And I'll be glad to see Granddaddy.
He's sweet too.

55:26.531 --> 55:29.158
I wish she were mine.

55:29.326 --> 55:34.163
Every time I look at her,
I wish I had just such a little girl.

55:40.253 --> 55:44.506
There she is at her little table,
playing with her little dishes...

55:44.674 --> 55:47.092
...looking cute and innocent...

55:47.260 --> 55:50.220
...looking like she wouldn't melt butter,
she's that cool.

55:50.597 --> 55:52.931
She can fool some people
with that innocent look...

55:53.099 --> 55:56.143
...she can put on and put off
whenever she wants, but not me.

55:56.311 --> 55:57.353
She can't fool me.

55:59.898 --> 56:03.609
Don't wanna talk to nobody smart, huh?
Like to talk to people she can fool...

56:03.777 --> 56:06.695
...like her mama and Mrs. Breedlove
and Mr. Emory.

56:08.907 --> 56:12.951
Here's some excelsior for you.
You talk silly all the time.

56:13.119 --> 56:15.371
I know what you do with the excelsior.

56:15.538 --> 56:17.456
You made a bed of excelsior...

56:17.624 --> 56:20.501
...down the basement,
behind that old furnace...

56:20.668 --> 56:23.962
...and you sleep there,
where nobody can see you.

56:25.215 --> 56:28.467
I've been way
behind the times heretofore...

56:28.635 --> 56:31.053
...but now I got your number, miss.

56:31.221 --> 56:34.765
I've been hearing things about you
that ain't nice.

56:34.933 --> 56:37.810
I been hearing you beat up
that Daigle boy in the woods...

56:37.977 --> 56:40.479
...and it took all of the Fern sisters
to pull you off.

56:40.647 --> 56:43.482
I heard you run him off the wharf,
he was that scared.

56:43.650 --> 56:47.277
If you tell lies like that,
you won't go to heaven when you die.

56:47.445 --> 56:50.823
I heard plenty.
I listen when people talk, not like you...

56:50.990 --> 56:53.992
...gabbing all the time,
won't let nobody get a word in edgewise.

56:54.160 --> 56:57.162
And that's why I know
what people are saying and you don't.

56:57.330 --> 57:02.042
People tell lies all the time, but I think
you tell them more than anybody else.

57:02.210 --> 57:05.504
I know what you done to that little boy
when you got him on that wharf.

57:05.672 --> 57:08.757
You better listen to me
if you want to stay out of bad trouble.

57:08.925 --> 57:11.677
What did I do, if you know so much?

57:11.845 --> 57:15.180
You picked up a stick
and you hit him with it.

57:15.348 --> 57:19.184
You hit him with it because he wouldn't
give you that medal like you told him to.

57:19.352 --> 57:23.021
I thought I seen some mean little gals
in my time...

57:23.189 --> 57:25.441
...but you're the meanest.

57:27.360 --> 57:30.446
You wanna know how I know
how mean you are?

57:30.613 --> 57:32.197
Because I'm mean.

57:32.365 --> 57:35.075
I'm smart and I'm mean.

57:35.577 --> 57:38.537
And you're smart and you're mean.

57:38.705 --> 57:40.873
And you never get caught
and I never get caught.

57:41.040 --> 57:42.207
I know what you think.

57:42.375 --> 57:46.795
I know everything you think.
Nobody believes anything you say.

57:46.963 --> 57:49.715
You wanna know what you done
after you hit him?

57:49.883 --> 57:53.969
You jerked the medal off his shirt,
and then you rolled that sweet little boy...

57:54.137 --> 57:57.222
-...off that wharf among them pilings.
-You don't know anything.

57:57.390 --> 57:58.849
None of what you said is true.

57:59.017 --> 58:01.810
You know I'm telling the gospel truth,
I got it figured out.

58:01.978 --> 58:06.565
You figured out something
that never happened, and so it's all lies.

58:06.733 --> 58:09.026
Now, take your excelsior
down to the basement...

58:09.194 --> 58:12.112
...and sleep on it
when you're supposed to be working.

58:12.280 --> 58:14.198
You ain't no dope, that I must say.

58:14.782 --> 58:18.410
That's why you didn't leave that stick
around where nobody could find it.

58:18.578 --> 58:19.703
Oh, no.

58:19.871 --> 58:22.080
You got better sense than that.

58:22.248 --> 58:25.209
You took that bloody stick...

58:25.376 --> 58:28.045
...washed it off real good,
and threw it in the woods...

58:28.213 --> 58:32.174
-...where nobody could find it.
-You know, I think you're a very silly man.

58:32.342 --> 58:35.928
It was you who was silly, thinking
you could wash off blood and you can't.

58:38.515 --> 58:41.808
-Why can't you wash off blood?
-Because you can't.

58:42.310 --> 58:44.478
And the police know it.

58:44.646 --> 58:48.815
You can wash and you can wash,
and there's always some left.

58:48.983 --> 58:50.901
Everybody knows that.

58:51.069 --> 58:53.028
I'm gonna call the police and tell them...

58:53.196 --> 58:56.949
...to start looking for that stick
in the woods.

58:57.617 --> 59:01.495
They got what they call
stick bloodhounds to help them look...

59:01.663 --> 59:07.084
...and them stick bloodhounds can find
any stick there is that's got blood on it.

59:07.252 --> 59:09.503
When they bring in that stick
you washed off...

59:09.671 --> 59:13.715
...the police are gonna sprinkle
some special blood powder they got on it.

59:14.300 --> 59:17.261
And that little boy's blood
is gonna show up on that stick.

59:18.555 --> 59:21.848
Gonna show up a pretty blue color,
like a robin's egg.

-Shh.

-Why, nothing, Mrs. Penmark.

about her little play dishes.

If you do, I'll report you.

has been washed off anything...

...a policeman can still find if it's there?

If he sprinkles some powder
on the place...

01:00:46.684 --> 01:00:48.393
...will the place really turn blue?

about such things? Leroy?

when I was out front this morning.

but I could ask Reginald Tasker.

-No, don't ask her.

-All right, Rhoda. It is not a very good act.

someone who doesn't know you...

it is quite easy to see through.

made me wonder.

Tell me,
do children ever commit murders...

01:03:51.202 --> 01:03:53.578
...or is crime something
that's learned gradually...

01:03:53.746 --> 01:03:55.747

01:03:55.915 --> 01:03:59.042

do really dreadful things?

-Oh, I'm so glad.

01:04:58.769 --> 01:05:02.439
Oh. Um, Father, this is Reginald Tasker.

01:05:03.232 --> 01:05:05.066
Reginald Tasker?

01:05:05.234 --> 01:05:07.360
-The writer fella?
-Afraid I stand convicted.

01:05:07.528 --> 01:05:10.614
-One of my favorites.
-Put you to sleep regularly, hmm?

01:05:10.781 --> 01:05:13.325
Mostly keeps me awake.
Also, I'm not forgetting...

01:05:13.492 --> 01:05:16.578
...that impressive research you've done
for the Classic Crime Club.

01:05:16.746 --> 01:05:19.956
Not half as good as the papers
they used to publish by Richard Bravo.

01:05:20.124 --> 01:05:22.334
CHRISTINE: Ha, ha.
-That old dodo?

01:05:22.501 --> 01:05:25.503
No, he's written himself out
and talked himself out.

01:05:25.671 --> 01:05:29.507
Now he just hobbles around the country,
working for a second-rate news service.

01:05:29.675 --> 01:05:32.677
I took time out because I wanted to see
my long-lost daughter.

-Where's my granddaughter?
-Oh, she's upstairs having dinner, Daddy.

01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:45.815
-She'll be down in a few minutes.
-That's fine.

01:05:45.983 --> 01:05:48.568
Oh. Sit down, huh?

01:05:48.736 --> 01:05:51.905
Say, any reason I can't have
one of those wicked-looking mixtures...

01:05:52.073 --> 01:05:56.201
-...Mr. Tasker's consuming?
-Oh, Daddy, I'm sorry.

01:05:56.369 --> 01:05:58.787
You're about ready
for another one too, aren't you?

01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:02.415
Haven't you ever considered coming back
into the criminology racket?

01:06:02.917 --> 01:06:05.335
There's been nobody like you
since you left.

...my last books didn't sell
as well as my earlier ones...

01:06:11.092 --> 01:06:14.469
...and the war came along,
and now I write filler.

01:06:14.887 --> 01:06:18.223
You've written some things
that will never be forgotten.

Let's hope.

01:06:20.267 --> 01:06:22.852
And now your daughter tells me
she's gonna try her hand.

01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:25.313
At writing? She can't even spell.

01:06:25.481 --> 01:06:27.232
REGGIE: Ha, ha.
-Oh.

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:31.736
It gets lonely here with Kenneth away.
I thought I might...

01:06:31.904 --> 01:06:34.906
...try a murder-mystery
during the evenings.

01:06:35.074 --> 01:06:37.534
Are you encouraging
this energetic competition?

01:06:37.702 --> 01:06:41.788
Well, I must admit, I didn't quite know
how to answer her first question.

01:06:41.956 --> 01:06:43.248
She was asking me...

01:06:43.416 --> 01:06:47.085
...whether criminal children
are always a product of environment.

01:06:47.253 --> 01:06:49.963
There's nothing difficult
about that, little one. They are.

01:06:50.131 --> 01:06:52.215
Mm, I always thought so too.

01:06:52.717 --> 01:06:55.260
-Always.
-Well, I couldn't prove you're wrong...

01:06:55.428 --> 01:06:58.430
...of course, sir,
but some fellow criminologists...

01:06:58.597 --> 01:07:02.767
...including some behavior scientists,
have begun to make me believe...

01:07:02.935 --> 01:07:05.812
...we've all been putting too much emphasis
on environment...

01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:08.231
...and too little on heredity.

01:07:08.399 --> 01:07:10.275
They cite a type of criminal...

01:07:10.443 --> 01:07:13.611
...born with no capacity
for remorse or guilt...

01:07:13.779 --> 01:07:15.780
...no feeling of right or wrong...

01:07:15.948 --> 01:07:19.576
...born with a kind of brain
that may have been normal in humans...

01:07:19.744 --> 01:07:21.411
...50,000 years ago.

01:07:21.579 --> 01:07:22.871
Nonsense.

01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:26.291
If you encounter a human
without compassion or pity or morals...

01:07:26.459 --> 01:07:28.877
...he grew up where these things
weren't encouraged.

01:07:29.045 --> 01:07:33.882
Or at birth, he received some pitiable
physical injuries to the brain tissues.

01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:35.592
Certainly not inherited.

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:39.471
That's final and absolute for me.
The rest is hogwash.

01:07:39.638 --> 01:07:41.973

I terminate for a refill.

-Oh, Daddy, I'm sorry. It's in the kitchen.

-Would you mind?
-Certainly not.

01:07:49.482 --> 01:07:52.358
Do you really mean to say
that nice family surroundings...

01:07:52.526 --> 01:07:54.819
...and advantages
could make no difference at all?

01:07:54.987 --> 01:07:59.699
Yes. It's as if these children
were born blind permanently...

01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:02.327
...and you just couldn't expect
to teach them to see.

01:08:02.495 --> 01:08:05.955
Well, would you notice
any brutish expressions on their faces?

01:08:06.123 --> 01:08:10.001
Sometimes, but more often,
they present a more convincing picture...

01:08:10.169 --> 01:08:11.753
...of virtue than normal folk.

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:13.546
But that's horrible.

01:08:13.714 --> 01:08:16.381
It's just that they are bad seeds...

01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:21.136
...plain bad from the beginning,
and nothing can change them.

REGGIE:
Bessie Denker? Was Bessie a bad seed?

01:08:33.067 --> 01:08:35.068
Well, yes, I should say so...

01:08:35.236 --> 01:08:38.196
...because when the full story
of her career came out...

01:08:38.363 --> 01:08:41.198
...it was realized that she must've started
at the age of 10.

all about those gloomy cases.

Mr. Tasker, would you tell me
the rest of the story?

-Did she ever use violence?
-She ended in mystery.

Just when the authorities
thought they had her dead to rights...

01:09:26.703 --> 01:09:29.497
...she disappeared, just vanished.

01:09:29.665 --> 01:09:31.916
She had quite a fortune by then.

01:09:32.084 --> 01:09:34.961
There was a rumor
that she went to Australia.

01:09:35.129 --> 01:09:40.425
A similar beauty turned up in Melbourne.
Her name was Beaulah Demerest.

01:09:40.593 --> 01:09:45.220
If it was the same person, she didn't have
to change her initials on her linen and silver.

How could she kill so many
and leave no trace?

she just took off for parts unknown...

-She wasn't convicted?

She killed him.

01:49:31.231 --> 01:49:34.024
But she's my little girl...

01:49:34.192 --> 01:49:36.777
...and I love her.

01:49:36.945 --> 01:49:39.613
Oh, my baby.

01:49:39.781 --> 01:49:45.327

CHRISTINE: "Polly put one toe out
from under the covers...

01:49:50.417 --> 01:49:52.334
...to find out how cold it was...

01:49:52.502 --> 01:49:54.878
...and it was nipping cold.

01:49:55.046 --> 01:49:58.007
She remembered why she'd wanted
to wake up and got out of bed...

01:49:58.174 --> 01:50:00.050
...very softly...

01:50:00.218 --> 01:50:03.178
...shivering and pulling on her dress
and her stockings.

01:50:03.346 --> 01:50:06.015
She'd never seen a Christmas tree
decorated and lighted...

01:50:06.182 --> 01:50:09.476
...the way they are at Christmas
in houses where children have--

01:50:12.355 --> 01:50:16.942
Where children have fathers,
and it isn't hard times.

01:50:17.110 --> 01:50:20.487
She'd promised herself
that she would see one."

01:50:21.698 --> 01:50:23.699
You have some new vitamins
to take tonight.

01:50:23.867 --> 01:50:25.159
-New ones?
-Mm-hm.

01:50:25.327 --> 01:50:27.369
-Are those the vitamins?
-Yes.

01:50:27.537 --> 01:50:29.163
May I see them, please?

01:50:30.332 --> 01:50:32.916
Why, yes, of course.

01:50:34.502 --> 01:50:36.587
They're some that Monica sent down.

01:50:36.755 --> 01:50:37.963
Oh.

01:50:39.424 --> 01:50:41.592
You know, I think Monica likes me.

01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:43.427
I'm sure she does.

01:50:43.595 --> 01:50:45.763
Swallowing pills is just a trick.

01:50:45.930 --> 01:50:48.724
Ha, ha. You're very good at it.

01:50:50.393 --> 01:50:52.227
Do you love me, Mommy?

01:50:55.231 --> 01:50:56.982
Oh, yes.

01:50:57.400 --> 01:50:59.902
Do you know about Leroy?

01:51:00.236 --> 01:51:01.278
Yes.

01:51:01.446 --> 01:51:04.948
You told me to put my shoes
in the incinerator, didn't you?

01:51:05.116 --> 01:51:08.202
-Yes.
-What did you do with the medal?

01:51:08.370 --> 01:51:10.329
I can have it now, can't I?

01:51:10.747 --> 01:51:12.831
I drove out to the playground alone...

01:51:12.999 --> 01:51:16.710
...and I went out on the pier when
it was dark and no one could see me...

01:51:16.878 --> 01:51:21.423
...and I dropped the medal by the pilings
in the water there.

01:51:21.591 --> 01:51:24.301
Mommy, Leroy had my shoes.

01:51:24.469 --> 01:51:26.804
And he said he was
gonna give them to the police...

01:51:26.971 --> 01:51:29.973
...and then tell them about me,
and they would put me in the electric chair.

01:51:30.141 --> 01:51:34.103
Shh. You don't have to say any more.

01:51:34.270 --> 01:51:36.772
Will you read more now?

01:51:37.315 --> 01:51:40.734
Yes, but first you have to take these.

01:51:42.070 --> 01:51:46.156
-So many?
-They're a new kind. I'm to take them too.

01:51:59.629 --> 01:52:03.841
I like apricot juice.
It doesn't even need ice.

01:52:13.309 --> 01:52:14.893
Mommy...

01:52:16.187 --> 01:52:21.150
...I saved a couple of matches and I lit...

01:52:21.818 --> 01:52:24.236
...the excelsior and locked the door.

01:52:24.404 --> 01:52:28.031
But it wasn't my fault, Mommy.
It was Leroy's fault.

01:52:28.199 --> 01:52:30.325
He shouldn't have said
he'd tell the police...

01:52:30.493 --> 01:52:33.328
-...and give them my shoes.
-I know.

01:52:43.798 --> 01:52:46.592
There. That's all.

01:52:52.307 --> 01:52:55.058
-Don't let them hurt me, Mommy.
-Oh.

01:52:58.354 --> 01:53:01.315
I won't let them hurt you.

01:53:07.572 --> 01:53:09.948

-Good night, Mommy.

01:53:10.116 --> 01:53:12.326

"When Polly was all dressed...

01:53:31.888 --> 01:53:35.390
...she found her shawl and crept quietly
out of the front door.

01:53:35.892 --> 01:53:39.853
The door creaked and she waited
and listened, but nobody woke up.

01:53:40.021 --> 01:53:41.563
She closed the door carefully...

01:53:41.731 --> 01:53:44.858
...and looked at the bright moon
and the shining cold snow.

01:53:45.026 --> 01:53:47.653
The Carters must have a tree.
They lived two blocks away.

01:53:47.821 --> 01:53:50.489
If they left the curtains open,
you could look in and see.

01:53:50.657 --> 01:53:52.491
If only there weren't any dogs.

01:53:53.076 --> 01:53:55.828
Polly walked carefully on the hard snow
on the walk...

01:53:55.995 --> 01:53:58.622
...keeping the warm shawl
close around her.

01:53:59.165 --> 01:54:01.875
It was further than she remembered
to the Carters' house...

01:54:02.043 --> 01:54:05.128
...but she could see
that there were lights in the windows.

01:54:05.296 --> 01:54:10.759
She came near it, only making a little
creaking noise on the snow...

01:54:10.927 --> 01:54:13.428
...and stood for a while
in front of the house...

01:54:13.596 --> 01:54:15.681
...before she dared go near.

01:54:23.106 --> 01:54:26.024
Then she gathered all her courage...

01:54:26.192 --> 01:54:30.487
...and walked across the yard,
her shoes sinking through the crust.

01:54:31.447 --> 01:54:35.117
The Christmas tree
was right in the front window...

01:54:35.285 --> 01:54:39.997
...and the lights were on in the house,
so she could see the fruits and the bells...

01:54:40.164 --> 01:54:43.792
...and the strings of popcorn and candy...

01:54:43.960 --> 01:54:49.298
...and the silver star at the top."

01:55:10.778 --> 01:55:12.321
...and I can't let them hurt you.

01:55:12.488 --> 01:55:15.407
I can't let them take you away
and shut you up.

01:55:15.575 --> 01:55:18.827
They'd stare at you
and make a show of you...

01:55:18.995 --> 01:55:23.332
...and nobody can save you from that
unless I save you.

01:55:24.667 --> 01:55:27.044
So sleep well...

01:55:27.378 --> 01:55:32.466
...and dream well, my only child
and the one I love.

01:55:33.635 --> 01:55:36.261

Again, that's what I can't understand.

Why did she do such a thing?

01:57:28.958 --> 01:57:31.626
She wasn't unhappy when I left.

01:57:31.794 --> 01:57:35.589
Maybe a little bit down
about us being separated for a while...

01:57:35.757 --> 01:57:37.632

01:58:18.174 --> 01:58:21.760
Yes. We heard the shot and ran down.
