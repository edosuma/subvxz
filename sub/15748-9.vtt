00:56.320 --> 01:00.950
I wanted you all to see the warehouse that I've
hired to store the extra stock for the sale.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.670
The Britain At Play event was
the first part of a strategy.

01:04.720 --> 01:07.110
We attracted significant attention.

01:07.160 --> 01:11.030
Now we'll capitalize by selling
like we've never sold before.

01:11.080 --> 01:14.270
We'll have rotating offers in
every department in the store.

01:14.320 --> 01:16.870
I made a personal promise
to our shareholders,

01:16.920 --> 01:19.190
and I intend to keep that promise.

01:19.240 --> 01:23.470
We need to make a lot of
profit, quickly. Frank...

01:23.520 --> 01:27.110
As you've seen, an intense advertising
campaign started this evening,

01:27.160 --> 01:30.630
with robust - some might
say aggressive - wording.

01:30.680 --> 01:32.710
How much of this do we have to sell?

01:32.760 --> 01:34.110
All of it.

01:34.160 --> 01:36.700
It'll be the Sale of the Century.

01:49.280 --> 01:51.620
You're working evenings now?

01:52.200 --> 01:55.200
I have a business meeting
with Harry later.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.870
What's in the suitcase?

01:57.920 --> 02:00.430
I was hoping to bunk
down on the couch.

02:00.480 --> 02:02.950
I've run out of money for digs.

02:04.440 --> 02:07.180
Book into lodgings for tonight - hmm?

02:08.360 --> 02:12.230
Come on. Can't you dip into
the Selfridge Estate account?

02:12.280 --> 02:15.390
No. We stick to the plan. We
take it all out in one lump sum,

02:15.440 --> 02:17.390
when the rest of the money comes in.

02:17.440 --> 02:21.030
Why's he having a business meeting
with you at this hour, anyway?

02:21.080 --> 02:25.200
As we're not together any more, I have
to take what time he offers, don't I?

02:26.400 --> 02:28.400
You'd better go.

02:38.920 --> 02:43.990
I'm sorry, sir, but there's nobody by the
name of Olga Pushkin at this residence.

02:44.040 --> 02:48.630
This arrived at the Russian Embassy with
instructions to be delivered here.

02:48.680 --> 02:50.950
There must be some mistake!

02:51.600 --> 02:53.600
Good evening.

02:54.640 --> 02:56.430
Is there a problem, Fraser?

02:56.480 --> 02:59.510
A mistaken delivery, ma'am.

02:59.560 --> 03:01.880
From the Russian Embassy.

03:15.880 --> 03:18.220
What on earth are you doing?

03:18.800 --> 03:20.800
Mama?

03:39.800 --> 03:42.670
Oh, I never thought
I'd see them again.

03:45.880 --> 03:48.350
This changes everything, Serge.

03:49.120 --> 03:51.460
Now you can build your plane.

03:51.760 --> 03:55.110
No. You've lived on your wits long
enough. I'm busy with Jacques.

03:55.160 --> 03:58.030
You can still support
Jacques and create...

03:58.080 --> 04:01.230
I'm going to sell some of these
and make your dreams come true.

04:01.280 --> 04:03.520
All through the Terror...

04:04.800 --> 04:06.800
...the running...

04:07.520 --> 04:09.920
...the relying on strangers...

04:10.800 --> 04:13.630
...one thing kept me going.

04:13.680 --> 04:15.790
You, Serge.

04:15.840 --> 04:17.839
You kept me going.

04:19.519 --> 04:22.840
Now we are in charge
of our own destiny.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.600
Darling.

04:32.080 --> 04:35.080
Harry! I thought maybe
you weren't coming.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.120
Nothing could keep me away.

04:48.480 --> 04:50.880
You haven't changed your mind?

04:51.200 --> 04:56.230
No, but if a supply merchant sees a ring like
that, it makes it even harder to haggle.

04:56.280 --> 04:58.870
Well, you could wear it if
we made an announcement.

04:58.920 --> 05:02.200
It might increase your buying
power, as my future wife.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.990
Let's just keep it
to ourselves, for now.

05:06.040 --> 05:08.510
At least until building starts.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.870
Besides...

05:10.920 --> 05:12.230
Besides...?

05:12.280 --> 05:16.910
Well, I need some time to get used
to being Harry Selfridge's wife.

05:16.960 --> 05:20.060
The project and marriage
is a lot to take in.

05:21.320 --> 05:24.550
You need an office. Come
to the store tomorrow.

05:24.600 --> 05:27.140
It'll be nice to have you around.

05:27.360 --> 05:30.080
Really? Thank you.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.120
Let's make this work.

05:58.760 --> 06:01.510
Hardly what you promised.

06:01.560 --> 06:03.790
It's not like we can
openly advertise.

06:03.840 --> 06:06.030
I am putting the word out.

06:06.080 --> 06:08.350
Rome wasn't built in a day.

06:09.360 --> 06:11.560
I'm not bankrolling Rome.

06:26.280 --> 06:27.870
Good morning.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.270
- Good morning, madam.
- Good morning.

06:30.320 --> 06:32.320
Good morning.

06:32.440 --> 06:34.780
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Good morning.

06:42.960 --> 06:44.870
And for you, madam?

06:44.920 --> 06:46.790
That's ten shillings, madam.

06:46.840 --> 06:50.470
An excellent idea, buying your
Christmas presents in advance.

06:50.520 --> 06:52.350
How long do we have
to keep this up for?

06:52.400 --> 06:54.740
Keep going. Just keep going.

06:55.640 --> 06:58.180
- May I help you?
- Oh, yes, please.

06:59.520 --> 07:02.790
I'll need more than that. We've sold
out of the butternut calfskin.

07:02.840 --> 07:05.110
Customers keep moving
things. I can't keep up.

07:05.160 --> 07:07.300
Oh, just get on with it!

07:08.280 --> 07:11.510
Is everything all right?
Can I help in any way?

07:11.560 --> 07:14.560
No. Everything's under
control. Thank you.

07:24.720 --> 07:26.860
Looks pretty busy to me.

07:27.400 --> 07:30.000
How many customers through so far?

07:31.080 --> 07:36.240
Footfall is up five times already
on this time last week.

07:37.280 --> 07:40.390
I want a till report from every
department by noon, Mr. Crabb.

07:40.440 --> 07:42.440
Yes, chief.

07:42.840 --> 07:45.110
Good morning, Mr. Selfridge.

07:48.440 --> 07:51.480
I thought I'd see you
here today, Sir Robert.

07:52.440 --> 07:54.190
What can I do for you?

07:54.240 --> 07:58.390
We've always employed a gentleman's code
of conduct between the retailers of London.

07:58.440 --> 08:02.270
We'd never spring a random
sale at Swan & Edgar.

08:02.320 --> 08:04.110
Nothing to stop you.

08:04.160 --> 08:08.310
The tone of your adverts
is unashamedly huckstering.

08:08.360 --> 08:11.270
"Buy now, while goods
are still in stock."

08:11.320 --> 08:13.910
And you've severely diminished
the amount of stock

08:13.960 --> 08:15.870
that we can lay our hands on now.

08:15.920 --> 08:18.270
So, you would compete, if you could?

08:18.320 --> 08:20.830
I doubt you would tell your
friends in the press that.

08:20.880 --> 08:25.510
You are responsible for this morning's
unfavorable editorials, I take it.

08:25.560 --> 08:28.230
Believe me - that's just the start.

08:28.640 --> 08:30.910
I've no doubt your board
will have plenty to say

08:30.960 --> 08:33.270
about the bad publicity.

08:33.320 --> 08:36.870
There are groups within the City who
found the tone of your advertising

08:36.919 --> 08:39.549
aggressive and scare-mongering.

08:39.600 --> 08:42.000
We're in business, Sir Robert.

08:42.880 --> 08:46.430
Tactics can be a little
rougher than we'd like.

08:46.480 --> 08:50.600
As for my board - like yours,
they're interested in one thing.

08:52.280 --> 08:54.280
Profit.

09:10.480 --> 09:12.480
Burton!

09:34.720 --> 09:36.720
Bitch!

09:50.120 --> 09:54.150
Do you know there's an article in here
calling our sale "un-public-spirited"?

09:54.200 --> 09:57.280
"Encouraging people to be
spendthrift." What utter rubbish!

09:59.360 --> 10:01.470
You'd better give this to Mr. Grove.

10:01.520 --> 10:04.260
The little fella might be missing it.

10:04.480 --> 10:06.820
Are you missing him, George?

10:07.040 --> 10:10.390
Well, I suppose I was playing
at happy families for a while.

10:10.440 --> 10:12.470
What with Agnes gone.

10:12.520 --> 10:16.240
Look, George, I'm sure Mr. Grove could
find a good position for you.

10:17.280 --> 10:19.070
Would you like me to ask him?

10:19.120 --> 10:21.870
I think it would be
best if I start over.

10:21.920 --> 10:23.920
Let me ask, anyway.

10:24.160 --> 10:26.160
Then you can decide.

10:33.320 --> 10:35.760
Gentlemen. Please.

10:36.480 --> 10:38.750
I take it you've seen the editorial.

10:38.800 --> 10:42.830
Sour grapes from our
competitors. Do we care?

10:42.880 --> 10:46.000
Not if Selfridge is focused
on profit, at last.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.630
As long as he shifts that
warehouse of merchandise.

10:49.680 --> 10:51.790
- What warehouse?
- Oh...

10:51.840 --> 10:55.430
He's bulk-bought at unheard-of
levels for this sale.

10:55.480 --> 10:59.270
But that's a huge gamble.
What if he doesn't shift it?

10:59.320 --> 11:01.870
The man might have
a history of gambling,

11:01.920 --> 11:04.260
but never with his own store.

11:04.520 --> 11:08.350
Look, despite the fact that
he does not consult us,

11:08.400 --> 11:10.910
I think it would be better
for future relations

11:10.960 --> 11:13.350
if we showed some support.

11:13.400 --> 11:17.270
I don't want to support something
that's going to lose me money.

11:17.320 --> 11:20.280
Why don't I go and see Mr. Crabb?

11:20.920 --> 11:22.950
He seems a reasonable fellow.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.270
I'll ask to inspect
the trading figures

11:25.320 --> 11:28.720
and see that the ship is
sailing on an even keel.

11:28.840 --> 11:31.240
Hmm. Good idea, Loxley.

11:38.800 --> 11:40.800
Come.

11:46.720 --> 11:49.390
Er... George found it this morning.

11:50.520 --> 11:52.720
It's Ernest's, of course.

11:53.160 --> 11:55.680
Yes... Thank you.

11:59.640 --> 12:02.840
Oh, I was hoping to speak
to you about George.

12:03.680 --> 12:06.230
He's looking for employment,

12:06.280 --> 12:09.080
and I thought, maybe,
with the sale...

12:10.920 --> 12:14.280
Well... let me come back to
you. I'll see what we have.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Thank you.

12:27.120 --> 12:30.270
I can't do the roof struts for
less than 30 shillings apiece.

12:30.320 --> 12:32.310
It was 25 on your estimate last week.

12:32.360 --> 12:36.070
Well, with all the rebuilding going on,
the price of timber goes up every day.

12:36.120 --> 12:38.270
You've got to toughen up
to play in this world.

12:38.320 --> 12:41.110
Does a gentleman's agreement
not count for anything now?

12:41.160 --> 12:44.830
We've already paid for the timber.
You gave Miss Webb her price.

12:44.880 --> 12:47.710
Mr. Selfridge, sir. I didn't
know the lady was with you.

12:47.760 --> 12:51.230
- Well, what difference does it make?
- Prices aren't the same for everyone.

12:51.280 --> 12:53.550
Well, in my store they are.

12:53.800 --> 12:56.630
Seeing as it's you, I'll hold
the price I gave the lady.

12:56.680 --> 12:59.020
You'll drop to 20 shillings.

12:59.520 --> 13:02.680
We can put a lot of business
your way, or none at all.

13:05.600 --> 13:08.700
- Yeah, all right.
- Sign the check, Miss Webb.

13:12.160 --> 13:14.830
- Thank you for that.
- You're welcome.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.030
I didn't like him taking
advantage of you.

13:17.080 --> 13:19.670
- I thought you were going to hit him.
- And you'd like that!

13:19.720 --> 13:22.360
No, I would not like that!

13:24.760 --> 13:28.030
Stop the sale now!

13:28.080 --> 13:30.270
Harry...

13:33.960 --> 13:36.430
Stay close to me. Excuse me.

13:43.200 --> 13:46.750
- Should we call the police?
- No. Just take the posters down.

13:46.800 --> 13:49.030
Do you want me to pull
back on the advertising?

13:49.080 --> 13:52.470
No. We forge ahead. Mr. Grove,
hire a new Head of Security.

13:52.520 --> 13:55.600
- Morning, Mr. Selfridge.
- I think I know just the person.

13:56.160 --> 13:58.950
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine. What are you going to do?

13:59.000 --> 14:03.720
Well, I'll tell you what I'm NOT going to do
- back down. They take me on at their peril.

14:09.520 --> 14:12.470
Right, Connie. We need 60 pairs
of stockings and 75 camisoles.

14:12.520 --> 14:14.790
Tell the porter to bring
every box up to Fashion.

14:14.840 --> 14:17.310
We'll have this lot sold
by the end of the day.

14:17.360 --> 14:19.710
- Well, what'll we do then?
- Oh, you needn't worry.

14:19.760 --> 14:22.760
There's a warehouse
full of replacements.

14:26.640 --> 14:28.640
Miss Mardle...

14:29.440 --> 14:31.760
Might I... have a word?

14:32.800 --> 14:34.950
Yes, of course.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.790
Tell the porter, Connie. Then
you can take your tea break.

14:37.840 --> 14:40.240
Oh, thank you, Miss Mardle.

14:43.840 --> 14:45.840
George Towler.

14:46.480 --> 14:50.270
He's perfect for the position
of Head of Security.

14:50.320 --> 14:51.870
Oh...

14:51.920 --> 14:54.310
I mean, he knows the store.

14:54.360 --> 14:56.550
He has military experience.

14:56.600 --> 14:58.390
Good, honest man.

14:58.440 --> 15:02.310
Would you ask him to come and see
me first thing in the morning?

15:02.360 --> 15:04.900
- Yes, I'd be happy to.
- Thank you.

15:05.920 --> 15:07.920
Yes.

15:08.800 --> 15:12.000
- Thank you, Miss Mardle.
- My pleasure, Mr. Grove.

15:20.040 --> 15:24.400
"Colleano's Club invites you to
join its exclusive membership."

15:25.520 --> 15:27.990
This batch is ready for posting.

15:29.160 --> 15:32.110
Mr. Barratt. Lord Sheridge.

15:32.160 --> 15:35.350
Jonathan Campbell. You
know a lot of rich people.

15:35.400 --> 15:37.830
Years of running the Palm Court.

15:37.880 --> 15:39.880
Regan will be pleased.

15:40.640 --> 15:43.470
There's only one thing
that will please Regan -

15:43.520 --> 15:45.860
turning that lot into money.

15:50.520 --> 15:53.710
I have independent means now, Harry.

15:53.760 --> 15:56.870
The Wiasemsky family jewels
have arrived out of Russia.

15:56.920 --> 15:59.790
I'm delighted for
you, Princess Marie.

15:59.840 --> 16:02.630
I will repay every single
penny of my debt to you.

16:02.680 --> 16:04.990
We can have a completely
fresh beginning.

16:05.040 --> 16:07.980
- Marie...
- Before Serge married Rosalie...

16:08.240 --> 16:11.790
...both our families had seen some...

16:11.840 --> 16:13.840
very dark times.

16:14.840 --> 16:19.270
Now there is a baby to look forward
to. New hope for the future.

16:19.320 --> 16:22.390
- Marie...
- I wanted to thank you for your kindness.

16:22.440 --> 16:25.870
I need not prevail upon
it any longer. There.

16:25.920 --> 16:29.430
You're not moving out. I
won't let you repay a thing.

16:29.480 --> 16:31.430
It's not about the money.

16:31.480 --> 16:33.350
You're part of the family now.

16:33.400 --> 16:35.400
You belong with us.

16:36.680 --> 16:40.280
And it means a lot to
me that you offered.

16:42.840 --> 16:45.950
It means a lot to
me that you refused.

16:48.040 --> 16:50.750
Rosalie, as a new mother, will
be glad of your support.

16:50.800 --> 16:53.670
Miss Webb is inexperienced
in this line of things.

16:53.720 --> 16:56.040
Ah. Miss Webb.

16:57.120 --> 17:00.160
Perhaps part of this
brighter future. No?

17:05.079 --> 17:09.950
We were going to wait for the right moment to
tell the family, so this is for your ears only.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.230
- Mmm.
- We're secretly engaged.

17:12.280 --> 17:13.869
- No?
- Yeah.

17:13.920 --> 17:17.550
Oh, congratulations! Wonderful news.

17:17.599 --> 17:21.190
So she'll be taking up a lot of
my time, and the Selfridge Estate.

17:21.240 --> 17:24.030
She has an office here now.
Why not pop in and say hello?

17:24.079 --> 17:26.079
I would love to.

17:37.080 --> 17:38.950
Very impressive.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.110
I could nearly believe in you myself.

17:41.160 --> 17:44.350
Well, the house plans are real.
We paid good money for them.

17:44.400 --> 17:47.500
That doesn't mean they're
going to get built.

17:47.760 --> 17:49.590
What do you want?

17:49.640 --> 17:52.510
The money you gave me
only covered lodgings.

17:52.560 --> 17:55.790
Well, I don't have
anything on me but...

17:55.840 --> 17:59.430
I do need you to deliver these estimates
to Mr. King at the Estate office.

17:59.480 --> 18:04.070
He keeps on asking for architect's instructions.
I'm trying to stay out of his way.

18:04.120 --> 18:06.590
He's waiting on these estimates.

18:07.360 --> 18:09.830
Please, Gus.

18:09.880 --> 18:13.480
You're enjoying this side of things
a bit too much for my liking.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.830
Is there a fire?

18:29.880 --> 18:32.750
Oh, that was Mr. Gerrard,
the architect.

18:32.800 --> 18:35.670
These creative souls can
be a bit of a handful.

18:35.720 --> 18:38.670
Harry told me your exciting news.

18:38.720 --> 18:41.110
Congratulations.

18:41.160 --> 18:43.390
I'm so happy for you both.

18:43.440 --> 18:45.190
Er... it's supposed to be a secret.

18:45.240 --> 18:48.950
Oh, don't worry. Your secret
is safe with me. I love secrets.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.750
I would like very much
for us to be friends.

18:52.800 --> 18:58.400
I feel you and I got off
on erm... wrong foot.

18:59.240 --> 19:01.240
I hadn't noticed.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.310
And you can never have
too many friends.

19:04.360 --> 19:08.470
That's exactly what I always think.

19:08.520 --> 19:11.630
- I'll have these typed up today.
- Thank you, Miss Plunkett.

19:11.680 --> 19:13.190
Oh, and...

19:13.240 --> 19:16.200
You - out. I need to
speak to Mr. Crabb.

19:20.720 --> 19:22.110
Lord Loxley...

19:22.160 --> 19:24.990
The board is very worried
about this sale.

19:25.040 --> 19:28.270
No-one came to us. Mr. Selfridge
knows what he's doing.

19:28.320 --> 19:30.790
We demand to see the trading
figures every day.

19:30.840 --> 19:34.360
Out of the question. Figures
need to be analyzed, put in -

19:35.080 --> 19:36.670
What are you doing here?

19:36.720 --> 19:39.310
The board is concerned about
a warehouse full of stock,

19:39.360 --> 19:42.550
bad press, protesters...
Is everything under control?

19:42.600 --> 19:45.110
- Loxley...
- Spiraling expenditure.

19:45.160 --> 19:48.990
How much did that Britain
At Play extravaganza cost?

19:49.040 --> 19:51.830
I don't expect you to
understand our strategy...

19:51.880 --> 19:55.510
More full pages of
advertisements this evening.

19:55.560 --> 19:59.590
Strategy, or a complete
and utter waste of money?

19:59.640 --> 20:02.590
- Get out. - I want answers.
- I don't care what you want.

20:02.640 --> 20:05.150
Reduced prices and increased advertising...

20:05.200 --> 20:08.870
Mr. Crabb, tell Mr. Edwards
to double the advertising.

20:08.920 --> 20:12.310
And we're offering an additional
ten per cent off everything.

20:12.360 --> 20:15.720
This is my store. I'll run
it my way. Now, get out.

20:29.680 --> 20:31.270
Grace, please wait.

20:31.320 --> 20:35.110
Don't do this. It's hard for
us both, but it's for the best.

20:35.160 --> 20:36.750
Why are you being like this?

20:36.800 --> 20:39.750
Look, I'm a shop girl;
you're the boss's son.

20:39.800 --> 20:42.140
We're from different worlds.

20:42.400 --> 20:45.070
I let myself down in
front of Mr. Crabb.

20:45.120 --> 20:48.190
It might not mean a lot to you, but
it certainly means a lot to me.

20:48.240 --> 20:50.110
More than I mean to you?

20:50.160 --> 20:53.390
See? You don't have to worry
about things like that.

20:53.440 --> 20:55.780
It's all mapped out for you.

20:55.960 --> 20:58.160
I have to make my own way.

20:59.680 --> 21:02.680
- Grace...
- Look, just leave me alone, Gordon.

21:03.400 --> 21:07.110
You know in your heart your
father will never approve.

21:07.160 --> 21:09.830
I don't know that.
How would I know that?

21:09.880 --> 21:12.680
You didn't tell him
about us, did you?

21:16.440 --> 21:18.440
Hold on tight, please!

21:19.200 --> 21:21.200
Grace...

21:33.360 --> 21:36.910
- I know. I know, Mr. Crabb.
- Know what?

21:36.960 --> 21:40.430
You're going to say I should
not have let Loxley get to me.

21:40.480 --> 21:45.950
That my orders about advertising and the discount
could come back to bite me in the... behind.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.920
I was going to say: let's
stick it to them.

22:02.120 --> 22:04.990
- Are we celebrating?
- Yes.

22:05.040 --> 22:07.710
Well, your new job, if you want it.

22:08.200 --> 22:10.710
Mr. Grove's offering
you Head of Security.

22:10.760 --> 22:12.760
Really?

22:13.960 --> 22:16.500
It's difficult to turn that down.

22:16.840 --> 22:19.920
Well, going back was the
right decision for me.

22:21.280 --> 22:24.110
It felt like I was
returning to family.

22:24.160 --> 22:27.560
With all the arguments that
come with family, too.

22:30.400 --> 22:33.700
Things must be better between
you and Mr. Grove.

22:34.160 --> 22:36.510
Well, they're getting better, George.

22:36.560 --> 22:38.900
Yes. They're getting better.

22:50.200 --> 22:52.800
Quiet, children, please.

22:55.680 --> 22:58.020
Please - can I just see him?

22:58.160 --> 23:01.190
Get away from my door. You
know you're not welcome here.

23:01.240 --> 23:05.550
Miss Mardle allowed me to see
Ernest. Please. I am his father.

23:05.600 --> 23:07.950
As far as Ernest is
concerned, I'm his father.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.720
Miss Mardle should not be encouraging
you to make contact with him.

23:25.120 --> 23:27.120
Things are looking up.

23:29.840 --> 23:31.950
That looks like a heavy loss to me.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.230
They'll win hard, but they'll
lose even harder.

23:35.280 --> 23:38.550
You've got board directors
over there. Bankers.

23:38.600 --> 23:41.110
These are quality punters.
You'll get your money.

23:41.160 --> 23:44.230
You'd better get some rich
losers in here, and fast.

23:44.280 --> 23:46.470
I'm running out of patience.

23:46.520 --> 23:49.620
You've got a week to
turn this place around.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.520
Right...

24:06.760 --> 24:09.300
How's the new office working out?

24:10.880 --> 24:12.880
I like being here.

24:14.120 --> 24:17.750
I like knowing that, if I want to see
you, all I do is step out that door.

24:17.800 --> 24:20.560
We make a heck of a team.

24:21.400 --> 24:24.400
We'll do good things
together, Nancy Webb.

24:25.720 --> 24:28.190
You've given my life back to me.

24:28.600 --> 24:31.340
You've changed my life... completely.

24:59.520 --> 25:00.720
Yes?

25:01.360 --> 25:04.960
- You wanted to see me?
- That man came to my house last night.

25:06.960 --> 25:08.960
To my house!

25:10.640 --> 25:12.430
What does he think
is going to happen?

25:12.480 --> 25:15.230
That I'm going to raise his
son to call him "father"?

25:15.280 --> 25:16.950
Oh, he just wants to see him.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.670
Well, that is never going to
happen. You can tell him so.

25:19.720 --> 25:22.820
- Roger...
- This is the result of your meddling.

25:24.080 --> 25:28.640
I cannot believe you let that
man see Ernest at your house.

25:29.920 --> 25:33.110
Why do you always see everything
in black and white?

25:33.160 --> 25:35.160
Right or wrong?

25:35.840 --> 25:37.550
In this instance, I'm in the right.

25:37.600 --> 25:39.430
Oh, in every instance.

25:39.480 --> 25:42.190
Well, let me tell you something.

25:42.240 --> 25:44.870
You're a hypocrite.

25:44.920 --> 25:47.430
Oh, yes, Doris let you down.

25:47.480 --> 25:52.510
But have you really forgotten that we had
an affair behind your first wife's back?

25:52.560 --> 25:54.310
How could I possibly forget?

25:54.360 --> 25:58.120
You're a constant shadow to me,
following me from place to place.

25:59.440 --> 26:02.510
You interfere in my work
and now in my private life.

26:02.560 --> 26:05.350
How could you possibly know
my feelings for Ernest,

26:05.400 --> 26:08.200
when you have no children
of your own?

26:12.760 --> 26:16.240
- Josie...
- Yes, it's true. I'm not a mother.

26:17.320 --> 26:19.390
But I am a human being.

26:20.720 --> 26:24.220
There was a time when I
thought you were one, too.

26:24.680 --> 26:28.040
- Leave me alone.
- With pleasure, Mr. Grove.

26:29.640 --> 26:31.710
With absolute pleasure.

26:35.640 --> 26:37.640
Good morning.

26:47.880 --> 26:50.820
25 English pounds.
Good day to you, sir.

26:53.720 --> 26:57.400
- Mr. Paignton, you've forgotten your receipt.
- Throw it in the bin.

27:05.120 --> 27:08.120
- Am I disturbing you?
- Not at all. Come in.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.070
For you.

27:13.120 --> 27:14.920
Oh...

27:19.600 --> 27:21.790
An Austrian crystal paperweight.

27:21.840 --> 27:24.270
From that gorgeous shop
in the Burlington Arcade.

27:24.320 --> 27:26.630
My engagement present.

27:26.680 --> 27:29.070
It's beautiful. Thank you.

27:29.120 --> 27:31.270
Oh, while I was there...

27:31.320 --> 27:33.750
...the most confusing thing happened.

27:33.800 --> 27:38.190
I saw a man who looked exactly
like your architect friend,

27:38.240 --> 27:40.580
coming out of the jeweller's.

27:40.720 --> 27:43.350
He had the same unfortunate,
abrupt manner.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.870
But they called him Mr. Paignton.

27:46.920 --> 27:50.830
Well, no wonder you're confused.
Our architect's Mr. Gerrard.

27:50.880 --> 27:53.670
Well, that's what I remembered.

27:53.720 --> 27:55.670
Well, it's a simple mistake to make.

27:55.720 --> 27:58.990
And surely, he corrected
you when you addressed him?

27:59.040 --> 28:03.630
Oh, I didn't. Like I
said, I was confused.

28:03.680 --> 28:06.710
Serve me right for not wearing
my spectacles in public.

28:08.120 --> 28:12.310
Oh, you will consult me when it comes
to making those wedding plans?

28:12.360 --> 28:14.670
I'm quite the expert, darling.

28:14.720 --> 28:16.990
I will. Thank you for this.

28:55.360 --> 28:57.230
Oh... where's Nancy?

28:57.280 --> 28:59.430
She was here just a moment ago.

28:59.480 --> 29:03.480
I er... I brought her
this engagement gift.

29:04.480 --> 29:06.950
And I think I dropped my glove.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.630
Oh, here it is.

29:09.680 --> 29:11.680
Thank you, darling.

29:17.600 --> 29:19.600
Ground, please.

29:33.920 --> 29:35.920
Gus?

29:36.640 --> 29:38.640
Are you here?

29:38.800 --> 29:40.800
Gus?

29:53.040 --> 29:56.040
I'm so glad you agreed
to come out with me.

29:57.560 --> 29:59.670
Why have you brought me here?

29:59.720 --> 30:01.670
I think you know why.

30:01.720 --> 30:04.630
Past history is best faced
before you move on.

30:04.680 --> 30:06.960
Who says I want to move on?

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
I do.

30:20.120 --> 30:23.070
Good evening, Violette.
Good to see you.

30:23.120 --> 30:25.390
Good to see you too, Victor.

30:25.440 --> 30:27.910
Are you not going to introduce us?

30:27.960 --> 30:31.320
Oh. Jacques de Sibour
- Victor Colleano.

30:32.360 --> 30:34.710
- Enchante.
- Pleasure to meet you.

30:34.760 --> 30:37.230
Enjoy your evening here. Please.

30:41.520 --> 30:44.030
- So, how have you been?
- Well.

30:44.080 --> 30:46.830
The place looks great. Very refined.

30:46.880 --> 30:49.790
Thank you. Please - enjoy.

30:49.840 --> 30:51.840
Thank you.

30:52.160 --> 30:54.160
Can we please leave?

30:54.520 --> 30:57.260
We've only just arrived. Have a seat.

31:04.080 --> 31:05.990
I feel very uncomfortable.

31:06.040 --> 31:09.190
Your former intimacy with Monsieur
Colleano doesn't bother me.

31:09.240 --> 31:12.360
It might bother any other man,
but I'm a man of the world.

31:13.720 --> 31:15.910
We are a good match.

31:15.960 --> 31:17.910
That sounds so cold.

31:17.960 --> 31:20.760
Shouldn't love figure
in the equation?

31:22.120 --> 31:25.220
Well, you've had love.
Where has it got you?

32:00.040 --> 32:02.040
Night, Pa.

32:02.960 --> 32:05.710
Your evening didn't
go well with Jacques?

32:05.760 --> 32:08.430
Depends on what you mean by "well".

32:09.160 --> 32:11.500
I think he wants to marry me.

32:13.960 --> 32:16.230
How do you feel about that?

32:17.600 --> 32:20.600
He's probably the right
kind of man for me.

32:21.200 --> 32:23.560
I can be a handful.

32:24.200 --> 32:26.340
Not too many could cope.

32:31.640 --> 32:35.400
Well, if the best he can do is
"cope", he's not the right man.

32:36.760 --> 32:39.880
You're my smart, funny,
gorgeous little handful.

32:42.240 --> 32:44.750
Whoever you decide to step out with,

32:44.800 --> 32:46.940
let it be on your terms.

32:53.120 --> 32:56.470
- Loxley.
- I didn't mean to cause alarm.

32:56.520 --> 32:59.030
Did you speak to Crabb, ask
him for trading figures?

32:59.080 --> 33:00.590
I did.

33:00.640 --> 33:03.790
He refused. Said Selfridge
knows what he's doing.

33:03.840 --> 33:05.910
- Did you believe him?
- Frankly, I don't think

33:05.960 --> 33:07.550
Crabb believes his own words.

33:07.600 --> 33:09.630
Did you tell him all our concerns?

33:09.680 --> 33:14.110
Not to mention the astronomical
cost of this advertising campaign.

33:14.160 --> 33:17.760
Selfridge burst in while
I was with Mr. Crabb.

33:18.480 --> 33:21.830
He was incandescent when I said
we wanted to offer our support.

33:21.880 --> 33:26.630
That it would help if we
could see trading figures.

33:26.680 --> 33:28.830
Sounds like the man
has something to hide.

33:28.880 --> 33:31.880
I'm not sure how to
tell you this, but...

33:35.280 --> 33:37.280
Sir...

33:41.360 --> 33:45.110
When I pressed him
on advertising costs,

33:45.160 --> 33:49.390
he told Mr. Crabb to
double advertising

33:49.440 --> 33:54.400
and ordered an extra discount of ten
per cent across the entire store.

33:55.520 --> 33:57.390
Mr. Crabb did not look happy.

33:57.440 --> 34:02.030
Damn sure he didn't. Nothing for it but
to convene an emergency board meeting.

34:02.080 --> 34:04.270
I'll get in touch with
the other board members.

34:04.320 --> 34:05.950
Is that absolutely necessary?

34:06.000 --> 34:09.389
Selfridge has to be called to account,
before he costs us money

34:09.440 --> 34:11.550
and our credibility in the City.

34:11.600 --> 34:13.870
You did your best, Loxley.

34:13.920 --> 34:16.659
It's time his board takes him on now.

34:19.679 --> 34:21.670
All the reds are on offer, madam.

34:21.719 --> 34:24.190
We have pomegranate, ruby...

34:24.239 --> 34:27.239
- Magenta surprise - that's the one for you.
- Thank you.

34:28.080 --> 34:30.550
We don't have time
for our usual patter.

34:30.600 --> 34:32.760
Close the sale quickly.

34:35.280 --> 34:38.230
Go and have your tea break.
I know we're all tired.

34:38.280 --> 34:40.550
- Oh, I'll carry on.
- This is England.

34:40.600 --> 34:43.000
No-one carries on without tea.

34:51.239 --> 34:56.510
Gentlemen - Mr. George Towler,
our new Head of Security.

34:56.560 --> 34:58.910
- Welcome back, George.
- Mr. Towler.

34:58.960 --> 35:00.830
Quite a coup you pulled
off, Mr. Grove.

35:00.880 --> 35:04.430
Miss Mardle said it was like coming back
to family. It does feel like that.

35:04.480 --> 35:08.120
Don't you dare leave home again.

35:11.320 --> 35:13.030
- Where's the ring?
- You mean the ring

35:13.080 --> 35:14.990
you got from the man
you stopped seeing?

35:15.040 --> 35:17.510
- Just tell me.
- I sold it.

35:17.560 --> 35:20.160
Stupid. Oh, stupid.

35:21.080 --> 35:23.350
How am I going to explain
that to Harry?

35:23.400 --> 35:24.950
What do I care?

35:25.000 --> 35:27.030
I want to know why you lied to me.

35:27.080 --> 35:30.990
You said you'd broken it off, and then you
go behind my back and agree to marry him.

35:31.040 --> 35:32.630
Were you trying to cut me out?

35:32.680 --> 35:34.750
I wasn't trying to cut you out.

35:34.800 --> 35:37.390
Then why did you say
yes, you'd marry him?

35:37.440 --> 35:39.440
Because I meant it!

35:50.440 --> 35:52.670
I love him, Gus.

35:55.920 --> 36:00.190
All the scams we've pulled.
Broken every rule.

36:00.240 --> 36:04.120
But the one rule you never break - you
don't fall in love with the target.

36:06.720 --> 36:08.720
I love him.

36:14.040 --> 36:16.830
I was just waiting for the
right moment to tell you.

36:16.880 --> 36:20.180
You really think you can
be Mrs. Harry Selfridge?

36:20.440 --> 36:24.710
This could be a new life for us. Hmm?

36:24.760 --> 36:27.630
And I'd look out for
you. Course I would.

36:27.680 --> 36:30.560
No more running. No more lying.

36:32.880 --> 36:35.220
We could have a proper life.

36:39.040 --> 36:42.140
And how could I pull
off being an architect?

36:42.400 --> 36:44.740
"Mr. Gerrard goes to America."

36:46.360 --> 36:49.360
You can go, just like
you've always wanted.

36:51.240 --> 36:54.430
That's why I haven't taken any
money from the Selfridge account -

36:54.480 --> 36:58.800
because, as long as that's all still
there, we haven't done anything wrong.

36:59.080 --> 37:01.510
Officially, we're clean.

37:01.560 --> 37:04.750
You've really thought this
through, haven't you?

37:04.800 --> 37:07.160
I want to stay clean.

37:10.200 --> 37:12.680
I'm going to build those houses.

37:15.360 --> 37:18.300
And I'm going to be
Mrs. Harry Selfridge.

37:22.480 --> 37:25.800
Bye, Lucy! See you tomorrow.

37:28.840 --> 37:30.190
- Miss Mardle?
- Yes?

37:30.240 --> 37:33.950
I'm checking every department, to see
where security needs to be increased.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.230
- I'll need to see you in the morning.
- Of course.

37:36.280 --> 37:38.590
- Miss Hawkins.
- George.

37:38.640 --> 37:42.400
- Mr. Towler.
- Oh, sorry...

37:57.600 --> 37:59.550
It's lovely to have you back, George.

37:59.600 --> 38:03.600
- I made the right decision.
- My little sister's delighted to see you, too.

38:04.400 --> 38:07.560
Maybe... you should think
about asking her out.

38:08.600 --> 38:12.000
And maybe... you should stop
trying to organize my love life.

38:12.560 --> 38:14.900
I can manage that myself. Ta.

38:21.880 --> 38:26.390
Sorry to disturb you, chief. Mr. Barratt's
summoning a board meeting this evening.

38:26.440 --> 38:28.230
They're demanding to see figures.

38:28.280 --> 38:32.070
We're nowhere near ready to
present. Loxley's behind this.

38:32.120 --> 38:34.270
You don't seem surprised, chief.

38:34.320 --> 38:36.790
They don't mean to see figures.

38:38.440 --> 38:40.780
I think they mean to oust me.

38:40.920 --> 38:43.060
What are we going to do?

38:43.600 --> 38:46.270
- Convene the meeting.
- Are you sure?

38:49.040 --> 38:52.550
I know how this company works,
inside and out. Loxley doesn't.

38:52.600 --> 38:54.870
I intend to stay one
step ahead of them.

38:54.920 --> 38:59.190
When you own this chair, Gordon, you
have to fight tooth-and-nail to keep it.

38:59.240 --> 39:02.540
You have to fight for
everything you hold dear.

39:34.320 --> 39:36.270
Oh...

39:36.320 --> 39:39.400
I'm here to see Miss Calthorpe,
please, Miss Pertree.

39:41.400 --> 39:44.340
It's not what you're
used to, Mr. Gordon.

39:54.560 --> 39:57.720
You won't talk to me anywhere
else, so... I had no choice.

39:58.360 --> 40:01.120
Erm... we're not usually so untidy.

40:03.480 --> 40:06.800
Is there somewhere more...
more private we could talk?

40:09.560 --> 40:11.560
I'll go.

40:26.120 --> 40:28.120
You were right.

40:28.960 --> 40:31.190
I've... I've been a coward.

40:31.240 --> 40:34.360
- Oh, Gordon, please...
- I'm here to fight for you, Grace.

40:34.880 --> 40:39.350
I want the whole world to
know... how much I love you.

40:39.400 --> 40:41.670
- Oh, Gordon...
- Just tell me you love me too,

40:41.720 --> 40:43.860
and I'll go on fighting.

40:44.320 --> 40:46.310
Of course I love you.

40:46.360 --> 40:49.880
But I can only be with you if
you tell your father about us.

40:51.400 --> 40:53.670
I should have told him
about us straightaway.

40:53.720 --> 40:55.720
I will, Grace. I will.

41:10.840 --> 41:13.310
You wanted to see me, Mr. Grove?

41:23.760 --> 41:29.440
You... You may visit Ernest
every second Sunday afternoon.

41:30.800 --> 41:35.200
We'll say you're a friend of the family.
Obviously, I'll make myself scarce.

41:35.840 --> 41:37.840
Thank you.

41:38.640 --> 41:41.110
What made you change your mind?

41:43.520 --> 41:46.060
Not everything's black and white.

41:46.240 --> 41:49.640
Sometimes you have to change
in order to move on.

41:51.360 --> 41:53.360
Thank you, Mr. Grove.

42:24.720 --> 42:28.510
- You didn't say goodbye last night.
Is everything all right? - Harry...

42:28.560 --> 42:30.900
I don't know how to tell you.

42:31.480 --> 42:33.870
- I've lost the ring.
- Oh, Nancy...

42:33.920 --> 42:36.910
I've looked everywhere. It must
have fallen off my finger.

42:36.960 --> 42:39.110
- Darling, it's just a ring.
- No, it's not,

42:39.160 --> 42:42.350
because it's the ring that
you got me. I feel awful.

42:42.400 --> 42:46.400
We'll get you another one. I'll take
you to dinner. Tell me what you like.

42:48.040 --> 42:50.040
Thank you.

42:50.920 --> 42:52.920
Thank you.

43:25.080 --> 43:27.080
- Gentlemen.
- Loxley.

43:32.080 --> 43:34.590
Ready for the board
meeting, Mr. Crabb?

43:34.640 --> 43:36.640
All set.

43:48.320 --> 43:52.320
Is Mr. Selfridge deigning
to join us any time soon?

43:53.240 --> 43:56.110
The Chairman of Selfridge's
wishes to invoke his right

43:56.160 --> 43:57.870
to a two-week postponement,

43:57.920 --> 44:03.230
according to Clause 18, Part 2,
in the Articles of Association.

44:03.280 --> 44:06.080
Thank you and good
evening, gentlemen.

44:10.200 --> 44:12.390
This is outrageous!

44:12.440 --> 44:14.640
The man is out of control.

44:17.400 --> 44:21.350
It is precisely this kind
of erratic behavior

44:21.400 --> 44:24.500
that has so troubled
Mr. Barratt and Mr. Lowe.

44:24.800 --> 44:29.360
I'm afraid to say I now fully
subscribe to their concerns.

44:30.440 --> 44:33.110
You have convinced me, gentlemen...

44:33.560 --> 44:35.760
Selfridge has to go.
