Everybody Hates Chris #046
"Caruso"
Closed Captioned

00:03.671 --> 00:04.805
CHRIS ROCK:
After two years at Corleone,

00:04.838 --> 00:07.108
I felt like things had
finally started to turn around.

00:07.141 --> 00:09.743
My grades were okay, I liked
most of my teachers

00:09.777 --> 00:11.579
and I had made friends...

00:11.612 --> 00:13.447
Make that, a friend.

00:13.481 --> 00:15.483
But he was a good one.

00:15.516 --> 00:18.319
There was only one problem
that wasn't going away.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.592
Morning, Cocoa Puffs.

00:26.660 --> 00:29.097
Caruso had made my life
a living hell.

00:29.130 --> 00:30.764
He had beaten my ass
every day

00:30.798 --> 00:32.200
and nothing kept him away.

00:32.233 --> 00:34.535
Not a 104 degree fever...

00:37.805 --> 00:39.773
...and not even
a national holiday.

00:39.807 --> 00:41.542
Happy Fourth of July, Sammy.

00:43.344 --> 00:44.712
What time is it?

00:44.745 --> 00:46.080
3:15. Why?

00:46.114 --> 00:47.448
Have you seen Caruso?

00:47.481 --> 00:49.350
He's usually punching you
in the face right now.

00:59.460 --> 01:00.461
As far as I was concerned,

01:00.494 --> 01:02.563
this was better
than Enter the Dragon.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.205
You want some more?

01:12.273 --> 01:14.108
Smart move.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.814
What are you staring at?

01:22.850 --> 01:23.884
Did you just see that?

01:23.917 --> 01:25.886
Saw it, but
I don't believe it.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.888
Other than being glad
that I wasn't next,

01:27.921 --> 01:30.624
at that moment I couldn't
have been happier.

01:30.658 --> 01:34.128
* I got joy
down in my soul... *

01:34.162 --> 01:37.365
See ya. Wouldn't want
to be ya.

02:10.498 --> 02:12.400
ROCK:
After seeing Caruso getting
a beat down,

02:12.433 --> 02:13.801
I had one question.

02:13.834 --> 02:16.837
Who is that kid anyway?

02:16.870 --> 02:17.905
His name's Bernard Yao.

02:17.938 --> 02:19.840
Apparently he's been going
here since last year.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.309
I never heard of him.

02:21.342 --> 02:22.710
How do you think Caruso's

02:22.743 --> 02:24.178
going to deal with
getting beaten up?

02:24.212 --> 02:25.279
Same way he deals
with everything--

02:25.313 --> 02:26.847
he's gonna take it out on me.

02:26.880 --> 02:29.217
Since the day I got
to Corleone,

02:29.250 --> 02:30.251
if Caruso had a problem,

02:30.284 --> 02:32.386
as far as he was concerned,
it was my fault.

02:32.420 --> 02:34.522
When he got an "F"
on his paper...

02:34.555 --> 02:35.723
"F"?!

02:39.227 --> 02:39.927
You're probably right.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.262
You wearing a cup?

02:41.295 --> 02:43.564
What

02:45.499 --> 02:46.667
Every day.

02:46.700 --> 02:47.735
You want to borrow it?

02:47.768 --> 02:50.671
No, I'm okay, thank you.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.940
Greg's cup was actually
a thimble.

02:52.973 --> 02:55.676
It's your funeral.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.411
Oh, no.
What?

02:57.445 --> 02:59.247
Holy Nicole Simpson.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.252
Can you hand me a carton
of milk, please?

03:04.285 --> 03:08.422
This is worse than I thought.

03:08.456 --> 03:10.258
Uh, Caruso, you okay?

03:10.291 --> 03:11.525
Yeah, I'm fine.

03:11.559 --> 03:12.760
And can you call me Joey?

03:12.793 --> 03:13.761
Joey?
Joey?

03:13.794 --> 03:15.195
Joey.

03:17.998 --> 03:19.533
Caruso looked about as happy

03:19.567 --> 03:21.935
as Bobby Brown in
a health food store.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.237
Did you see that?

03:23.271 --> 03:24.338
I don't blame him.

03:24.372 --> 03:25.739
If somebody roundhouse kicked
me across a street,

03:25.773 --> 03:26.874
I'd avoid him, too.

03:26.907 --> 03:30.010
Greg avoided trees 'cause
he once got a splinter.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.779
Yao didn't just
beat him down--

03:31.812 --> 03:33.414
he beat the bully
out of him.

03:38.686 --> 03:44.425
While I was free from Caruso,
my dad was free from work.

03:44.458 --> 03:45.759
You don't need to work
this morning?

03:45.793 --> 03:47.495
Your daddy's on
vacation this week.

03:47.528 --> 03:49.663
Man, I wish I could
take a week off.

03:49.697 --> 03:50.998
I need a vacation.

03:51.031 --> 03:52.800
What for? You're a kid.

03:52.833 --> 03:53.967
Your whole life's a vacation.

03:55.303 --> 03:57.838
This is a waste
of time.

03:57.871 --> 03:58.972
I should be working.

03:59.006 --> 04:01.409
You got five paid vacation days.

04:01.442 --> 04:02.776
Paid, Julius.

04:02.810 --> 04:05.279
Yeah, but they're paying me
for a 40-hour week.

04:05.313 --> 04:07.515
I average close to 70.

04:07.548 --> 04:09.583
If you think about it,
I'm actually losing money.

04:09.617 --> 04:10.884
Then don't think about it.

04:10.918 --> 04:11.852
Baby, get some rest.

04:11.885 --> 04:13.954
Pay attention to your health
for a change.

04:13.987 --> 04:16.990
There's nothing wrong
with my health.

04:17.024 --> 04:19.460
You got the gout, high blood
pressure, arthritis,

04:19.493 --> 04:23.297
a bad back, the sniffles,
an ingrown toenail, seborrhea,

04:23.331 --> 04:25.599
psoriasis,
a strained ligament,

04:25.633 --> 04:28.336
dyspepsia and gastric reflux.

04:28.369 --> 04:30.338
My mother was making
a lot of sense.

04:30.371 --> 04:32.406
Unfortunately, all
my father heard was...

04:32.440 --> 04:34.808
You got the light bill,
the gas bill, the phone bill,

04:34.842 --> 04:35.843
the heat bill, the water bill,

04:35.876 --> 04:40.448
car note, taxes,
insurance, food,
rent, clothes,

04:40.481 --> 04:42.950
heating, cooling,
washing, drying...

04:42.983 --> 04:45.919
My mother thought it was work
that gave my father stress.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.355
But she was wrong--

04:47.388 --> 04:48.356
it was debt.

04:48.389 --> 04:50.424
Which is why he did this.

04:50.458 --> 04:51.925
Hey, Frank, it's Julius.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.361
Listen, I got a few days off

04:53.394 --> 04:55.095
and I'm looking to pick up
a little work.

04:55.128 --> 04:58.699
So FYI, my sources tell me
that Yao likes using

04:58.732 --> 05:00.000
the upstairs bathroom
by the art room.

05:00.033 --> 05:01.669
What sources?

05:01.702 --> 05:03.070
What are you--
Spenser for Hire?

05:03.103 --> 05:04.405
I guess that makes me Hawk.

05:04.438 --> 05:05.305
It's not important.

05:05.339 --> 05:07.341
All that matter is
that you avoid using it.

05:07.375 --> 05:08.909
Why? Just because Yao
beat up Caruso

05:08.942 --> 05:10.811
doesn't mean he's going
to beat us up, too.

05:10.844 --> 05:12.813
Did you see the way
he was looking at us

05:12.846 --> 05:14.114
when he came out
of that alley?

05:14.147 --> 05:15.583
I'm not taking
any chances.

05:15.616 --> 05:17.685
You're overreacting.

05:18.919 --> 05:21.355
Okay, look, we don't
want any trouble.

05:21.389 --> 05:22.790
What's this?

05:22.823 --> 05:24.057
My lunch money.

05:24.091 --> 05:26.026
I always pay on time,
and I don't even mind

05:26.059 --> 05:28.061
tossing in a few extra
bucks around the holidays.

05:28.095 --> 05:29.029
What is wrong
with you guys?

05:29.062 --> 05:30.063
I don't want your money.

05:30.097 --> 05:32.466
But after what you
did to Caruso,

05:32.500 --> 05:34.368
we figured you
were taking over.

05:34.402 --> 05:35.235
I'm not taking
over anything.

05:35.268 --> 05:37.070
I just got tired of him
picking on me.

05:37.104 --> 05:38.672
That's why
I took karate.

05:38.706 --> 05:41.542
It was either that, or give up
my lunch money.

05:41.575 --> 05:44.011
If I had to pay
for karate lessons,

05:44.044 --> 05:45.879
I wouldn't have
had lunch money.

05:47.681 --> 05:50.418
Now that's what
I call relaxing.

05:50.451 --> 05:51.952
It's getting late.

05:51.985 --> 05:53.754
You'd better be going.

05:53.787 --> 05:56.390
What do you mean?
It's only 8:15.

05:56.424 --> 05:57.925
You never know.
There could be traffic.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.860
I wouldn't want you
to be late for work.

05:59.893 --> 06:02.029
I think I have time
for a cup of coffee.

06:02.062 --> 06:03.464
Oh, could you get me
another cup?

06:03.497 --> 06:05.733
Look, I'm just saying,
you know,

06:05.766 --> 06:07.701
you're still on your
three-month probation.

06:07.735 --> 06:09.637
I wouldn't want you
to have a mark on
your record.

06:09.670 --> 06:12.473
Oh, please, that office
is so disorganized.

06:12.506 --> 06:15.008
I'm gonna sit right here
and have my cup of coffee.

06:15.042 --> 06:18.546
And besides, they don't keep
records of anything anyway.

06:18.579 --> 06:22.082
Ironically, she worked
at the Department of Records.

06:22.115 --> 06:24.485
Baby, we're out of coffee,

06:24.518 --> 06:27.521
but maybe you can pick up
another cup on the way to work.

06:27.555 --> 06:31.625
Okay, all right, I get it,
I get it.

06:31.659 --> 06:34.795
You want me to leave so you can
have your day of relaxation.

06:34.828 --> 06:35.929
I get it.

06:35.963 --> 06:37.598
Have a good day.
Have a good day.

06:37.631 --> 06:38.799
All right,
get some rest.

06:38.832 --> 06:41.001
Okay.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.740
Clark Kent's got
nothing on him.

06:52.145 --> 06:53.180
I'm out.

06:54.982 --> 06:56.450
The next few days at school

06:56.484 --> 06:57.851
were the best I'd ever had
at Corleone.

06:57.885 --> 06:59.553
For the first time Caruso

06:59.587 --> 07:01.889
didn't knock the books out
of my hand when he passed me.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.123
Hi, Chris.

07:05.793 --> 07:07.728
He didn't shove me in a locker.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.530
Hi, Chris.

07:10.598 --> 07:12.866
And the only name he called me
was mine.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.935
Hey, Chris.

07:14.968 --> 07:17.671
For the first time
I could remember,

07:17.705 --> 07:19.907
I didn't have
a problem at school.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.441
Hey! Ah!

07:24.578 --> 07:26.980
Give me your lunch money.

07:27.014 --> 07:28.949
I didn't have a problem...

07:28.982 --> 07:31.084
now I had a lot of problems.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.223
ROCK:
Caruso losing the fight
with Bernard Yao

07:36.256 --> 07:37.991
was good and bad.

07:38.025 --> 07:40.494
On the upside, Caruso was
no longer on my back.

07:40.528 --> 07:43.497
On the downside, I was getting
beat like eggs at IHOP.

07:43.531 --> 07:44.765
Hey, give me
your lunch money.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.133
Hey, don't give him
your lunch money.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.568
Give me your lunch money.

07:47.601 --> 07:48.869
He's going to
give it to me.

07:48.902 --> 07:51.905
No, he's going
to give it to me.
No, he's not.

07:51.939 --> 07:53.841
Give it to me!
It's mine!

07:53.874 --> 07:55.543
This is how kids used to fight

07:55.576 --> 07:57.044
before there were guns
in school.

07:58.178 --> 08:00.013
Freedom! Freedom!

08:00.047 --> 08:01.782
Freedom!

08:07.988 --> 08:09.957
All clear.

08:09.990 --> 08:13.026
It's like there's not enough
of you to go around, man.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.862
I haven't seen
anger and violence

08:14.895 --> 08:16.129
like this since
my custody hearing.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.565
Me neither.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.567
Well, at least
outside my neighborhood.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.034
What's going on?

08:21.068 --> 08:21.969
When Yao beat up Caruso,

08:22.002 --> 08:23.871
it threw the whole school
out of whack.

08:23.904 --> 08:25.005
What do you mean?

08:25.038 --> 08:26.640
The school is like
The Godfather.

08:26.674 --> 08:28.976
There's a hierarchy,
and on top is
Don Corleone.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.979
But in our case--
Don Caruso.

08:32.012 --> 08:35.983
Caruso was the toughest
kid in school.

08:36.016 --> 08:38.151
No one dared
challenge his authority.

08:38.185 --> 08:40.087
Almost everybody
hated Caruso,

08:40.120 --> 08:42.022
but a lot of kids envied him.

08:42.055 --> 08:43.891
They wanted to be him,

08:43.924 --> 08:46.560
but were too scared to do
anything about it.

08:46.594 --> 08:47.895
When Caruso was out of the way,

08:47.928 --> 08:50.030
the school was up for grabs.

08:53.634 --> 08:55.736
It was going to be a bloodbath,

08:55.769 --> 08:57.705
and I knew that unless
I did something

08:57.738 --> 08:59.773
it was going to be my blood.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.277
Dude, how do you
know all this?

09:04.311 --> 09:06.079
When you spend a lot of time
in dark lockers

09:06.113 --> 09:07.114
you think about things.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.649
I started writing

09:08.682 --> 09:10.784
my first HBO Special
in a locker.

09:13.020 --> 09:15.355
So what do we do now?

09:15.388 --> 09:17.825
We got to put Caruso
back in power.

09:20.994 --> 09:22.630
ROCHELLE:
Mm-hmm.

09:22.663 --> 09:24.798
$47 for alimony?!

09:27.267 --> 09:28.836
DREW:
I bet you don't.

09:28.869 --> 09:29.903
TONYA:
Bet you I will.

09:29.937 --> 09:32.072
I bet you don't.
Keep dreaming.

09:32.105 --> 09:34.875
A wood chipper? Where did
she get a wood chipper from?

09:34.908 --> 09:37.878
Mm-hmm... mm-hmm...

09:39.112 --> 09:44.184
Mm-hmm,
mm-hmm...

09:44.217 --> 09:46.854
Mm-hmm...

09:46.887 --> 09:50.023
He left her for
a midget?!

09:50.057 --> 09:51.158
Uh-huh.

09:51.191 --> 09:52.960
Ma, I'm home.
Uh-huh.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.762
Right.

09:54.795 --> 09:56.163
Hey, Mom, where's Dad?

09:56.196 --> 09:57.631
He's probably sleeping.

09:57.665 --> 09:59.299
Leave him alone,
'cause he needs his rest.

09:59.332 --> 10:02.002
And, boy, close
my door. You don't
live in a barn.

10:02.035 --> 10:03.837
Uh-huh.

10:03.871 --> 10:06.173
I didn't even open
that door.

10:11.411 --> 10:13.714
Back at school,
I feared for my life.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.749
So I couldn't even enjoy
the epidemic

10:15.783 --> 10:17.284
of white-on-white violence.

10:24.892 --> 10:26.026
Look at that.

10:26.059 --> 10:27.194
Caruso's a broken man.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.331
Don't worry,
I know how to fix him.

10:31.364 --> 10:33.333
Caruso lost a fight
to the new champ.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.135
But I figured
he couldn't resist a fight

10:35.168 --> 10:37.204
with the old chump.

10:39.406 --> 10:40.974
What is wrong with you?

10:41.008 --> 10:42.743
Let go of me.
What's wrong with you?

10:42.776 --> 10:43.811
You're what's wrong with me,

10:43.844 --> 10:46.179
walking around here like a sad
Richie Cunningham.

10:46.213 --> 10:48.081
You should be kicking
some serious butt.

10:48.115 --> 10:49.750
What are you talking about?

10:49.783 --> 10:51.819
Yao kicked the crap out of you.

10:51.852 --> 10:53.220
You're just gonna take it?

10:53.253 --> 10:55.055
What do you expect?

10:55.088 --> 10:56.289
Well, maybe you can't beat him,

10:56.323 --> 10:57.858
but you can beat me.

10:57.891 --> 10:59.126
I mean, come on, punch me,

10:59.159 --> 11:01.261
kick me, push me on the ground,
something.

11:01.294 --> 11:02.963
Have you lost your mind?

11:02.996 --> 11:04.898
Yes.
Have you lost your mind?

11:04.932 --> 11:08.869
Call me Stymie, Rochester,
Tootsie Roll, Inkwell.

11:08.902 --> 11:09.870
Come on, man!

11:09.903 --> 11:11.038
What are you doing?

11:11.071 --> 11:13.473
Prompting an angry call
from Bill Cosby.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.776
Look, I-I got to go.

11:15.809 --> 11:18.211
Desperate times call for
desperate measures.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.048
You want to act like a punk,

11:21.081 --> 11:22.783
I'm gonna treat you
like a punk.

11:22.816 --> 11:25.052
Give me your
lunch money, Opie.

11:25.085 --> 11:27.220
First time I was scared
he wouldn't hit me.

11:27.254 --> 11:28.822
All right, here.

11:28.856 --> 11:30.123
Just leave me alone.

11:38.065 --> 11:40.067
Well, that didn't work.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.035
So now what?

11:42.069 --> 11:44.171
Well, we got
his lunch money.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.073
Let's go get a pizza
and think about it.

11:46.106 --> 11:50.110
We got a pizza, but eight
different bullies took a slice.

11:54.147 --> 11:56.249
Since I couldn't get Caruso
to put a stop to things,

11:56.283 --> 11:58.218
I had to go to the guy
who started it.

11:58.251 --> 11:59.887
Hey, Yao, can I talk to you
for a second?

11:59.920 --> 12:01.288
Give me your lunch money first.

12:02.522 --> 12:04.792
I'm joking.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.493
Yeah, good one, jackass.

12:06.526 --> 12:07.394
What do you want?

12:07.427 --> 12:08.395
I have a problem

12:08.428 --> 12:09.362
and I need your help.

12:09.396 --> 12:10.363
I got my own problems.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.232
I guarantee you
they cannot be worse than mine.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.167
I'm failing math.
I got work to do.

12:14.201 --> 12:15.235
I don't have time for this.

12:15.268 --> 12:17.070
Wait, you're not good at math?

12:17.104 --> 12:19.807
What, just because I'm Asian,
I have to be good in math?

12:19.840 --> 12:21.208
You're black, can you moonwalk?

12:21.241 --> 12:23.977
I didn't mean it like that.
And, no, I can't moonwalk.

12:24.011 --> 12:26.246
So, I can't use chopsticks.
I don't like watermelon.

12:26.279 --> 12:27.280
I can't make a swan
out of paper.

12:27.314 --> 12:28.415
I don't have sickle cell anemia.

12:28.448 --> 12:29.950
I don't own a dry cleaners.

12:29.983 --> 12:31.318
I bet you like rice.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.220
You know what, man,
just forget this.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.288
It's simple, I need you
to fight Caruso again.

12:35.322 --> 12:37.057
Why would I do that?

12:37.090 --> 12:38.792
At least when Caruso
was in control,

12:38.826 --> 12:40.828
we only had one person
to worry about.

12:40.861 --> 12:42.830
And now, everybody's
kicking the crap out of

12:42.863 --> 12:44.431
anybody they can get
their hands on.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.299
And nine times out of ten...

12:46.333 --> 12:47.467
it's me.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.069
I don't want to fight.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.470
If you don't
want to do it for me,

12:50.503 --> 12:52.239
then do it for the school.

12:52.272 --> 12:55.475
We may not want a bully,
but we need a bully.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.978
Look, I already fought him once
and beat him.

12:58.011 --> 12:59.847
What makes you think
he would fight me again?

12:59.880 --> 13:02.149
Let me take care of that.

13:03.316 --> 13:04.484
And what's in it for me?

13:11.358 --> 13:13.460
Caruso...

13:13.493 --> 13:15.128
I know you're in here.

13:15.162 --> 13:17.030
It's me, Chris.

13:18.431 --> 13:20.467
What?

13:20.500 --> 13:22.335
I need to talk to you.

13:22.369 --> 13:24.872
I knew I had to convince Caruso
to face Yao.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.339
Now it was the biggest
fight of my life

13:26.373 --> 13:28.041
and I wasn't even in it.

13:28.075 --> 13:29.409
I don't have
any more money.

13:29.442 --> 13:31.879
Man, would you just
come out here?

13:33.246 --> 13:36.049
Man, what is wrong with you?

13:36.083 --> 13:39.052
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I actually feel bad for you.

13:39.086 --> 13:40.854
You used to run this school.

13:40.888 --> 13:42.089
And now look at you.

13:42.122 --> 13:45.158
You're sad, pathetic and
scared out of your mind.

13:45.192 --> 13:47.227
Shoot, if you were black,
you'd be me.

13:47.260 --> 13:48.195
What do you want from me?

13:48.228 --> 13:50.330
You need to stand up to Yao.

13:50.363 --> 13:52.132
Are you crazy?

13:52.165 --> 13:54.634
He hit me in the eye
with a Siberian flying tiger.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.203
I couldn't see straight
for three days.

13:56.236 --> 13:58.238
So?

13:58.271 --> 14:00.273
When I first came
to this school,

14:00.307 --> 14:02.309
you smacked me around.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.111
But I stood up to you.

14:04.144 --> 14:05.512
Fight! Fight! Fight!

14:05.545 --> 14:07.514
And you smacked me around
some more.

14:07.547 --> 14:11.084
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!

14:11.118 --> 14:13.186
So what's your point?

14:13.220 --> 14:17.524
You see, every superhero
needs a villain.

14:17.557 --> 14:20.227
I mean, where would Superman be

14:20.260 --> 14:21.594
if it wasn't for
Lex Luthor?

14:21.628 --> 14:24.531
He'd be at the Hall of Justice
watching super TV.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.269
And the Fantastic Four,

14:29.302 --> 14:31.671
where would they be
if it wasn't for Dr. Doom?

14:31.704 --> 14:33.907
At the circus.

14:35.575 --> 14:37.444
The reason you need

14:37.477 --> 14:40.948
to stand for yourself
is because I need you.

14:40.981 --> 14:42.015
The school needs you.

14:42.049 --> 14:44.384
And unless you want

14:44.417 --> 14:47.921
to spend the rest of the school
year slinking around

14:47.955 --> 14:50.423
and being scared to let me
kick the crap out of you,

14:50.457 --> 14:53.493
you need to stand up
for yourself.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.969
You really think I can beat him?

15:02.002 --> 15:05.672
I don't think so,
I know so.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.340
After a few days

15:07.374 --> 15:09.342
of successfully working
his secret job,

15:09.376 --> 15:11.278
my dad ran into two problems--

15:11.311 --> 15:13.080
Drew and Tanya.

15:13.113 --> 15:14.214
I still don't see how

15:14.247 --> 15:15.983
you threw your back out
doing nothing.

15:16.016 --> 15:18.151
Oh, I must've slept funny.

15:18.185 --> 15:20.387
Well, you sleep
harder than you work.

15:22.589 --> 15:25.425
Hey, Dad, you probably
hurt you back carrying

15:25.458 --> 15:27.327
all those packages.
What?

15:27.360 --> 15:29.629
Yeah, this afternoon,
me and Drew saw you on

15:29.662 --> 15:31.264
Fulton Avenue

15:31.298 --> 15:32.432
when we were walking
home from school.

15:32.465 --> 15:33.733
Okay, baby, here's some aspirin.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.368
It'll relax your muscles a bit.

15:35.402 --> 15:36.436
Who did y'all see
on Fulton Avenue?

15:36.469 --> 15:38.471
Nobody.
They're just talking.

15:38.505 --> 15:39.639
Oh.

15:41.474 --> 15:42.375
Whoever that was,

15:42.409 --> 15:45.112
he looked just like you.
I hope he doesn't

15:45.145 --> 15:47.180
hit somebody in the head
with a pipe and run,

15:47.214 --> 15:49.149
because if he does,
you're going to jail.

15:49.182 --> 15:50.583
I mean, for real, Dad,

15:50.617 --> 15:52.052
he looked just like you--

15:52.085 --> 15:54.321
bald head, beard,
dark skin, everything.

15:54.354 --> 15:55.655
I even called you.

15:55.688 --> 15:57.357
I said, "Daddy...!"

15:57.390 --> 15:58.458
Sure did.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.160
Then the guy turned around
and looked right at us,

16:00.193 --> 16:01.394
covered his face
with a package

16:01.428 --> 16:02.996
and ran inside
the building.

16:03.030 --> 16:04.597
Hey, baby, you want
a beer before dinner.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.033
Oh, thanks.

16:06.066 --> 16:07.467
So who did y'all see
running into a building?

16:07.500 --> 16:09.469
Nobody.
They just playing.

16:09.502 --> 16:10.770
:
Kids.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.772
Playing all the time.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.242
Mm, okay.

16:17.477 --> 16:18.678
I don't know, Dad.

16:18.711 --> 16:21.348
If they had a look-
like-you contest,

16:21.381 --> 16:22.615
he would win.

16:22.649 --> 16:23.650
Yeah.

16:23.683 --> 16:25.552
Okay, okay, fine.

16:25.585 --> 16:27.387
It was me.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.522
I took a job delivering packages
for the week.

16:29.556 --> 16:31.024
Ooh...

16:31.058 --> 16:32.392
You're supposed
to be on vacation.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.527
Mama's gonna be mad.

16:34.561 --> 16:36.396
Not if you keep your mouth shut.

16:36.429 --> 16:39.499
You know Mom hates to be the
last to find out about stuff.

16:39.532 --> 16:41.434
And I don't want her
mad at me.

16:41.468 --> 16:43.503
Do you guys like
having a father?

16:43.536 --> 16:45.038
Yes.
Yes.

16:45.072 --> 16:47.374
Keep quiet.

16:47.407 --> 16:48.408
And I'll give you five dollars.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.243
Each?

16:50.277 --> 16:52.579
Yeah.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.247
Now shh.

16:54.281 --> 16:56.716
I had brought two fighters
of different ethnicities

16:56.749 --> 16:58.518
together for a fixed fight.

16:58.551 --> 17:01.721
I felt just like Don King.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.723
Hey, Fried Rice.
What took you so long?

17:03.756 --> 17:05.358
Why don't you ask your mother?

17:18.705 --> 17:22.709
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

17:22.742 --> 17:24.377
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight!

17:24.411 --> 17:26.413
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

17:26.446 --> 17:27.480
Where you going?

17:27.514 --> 17:28.581
Don't you want
to see who wins?

17:28.615 --> 17:29.649
What's the difference?

17:29.682 --> 17:31.184
Either way, tomorrow,

17:31.218 --> 17:32.552
someone's gonna be kicking
the crap out of me.

17:37.290 --> 17:40.260
Back on my dad's secret job,
he didn't know it,

17:40.293 --> 17:43.062
but the shipment
was about to hit the fan.

17:50.503 --> 17:52.472
Hey, excuse me,
excuse me, look.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.541
I'll give you five dollars
if you go in there

17:54.574 --> 17:55.608
and get a package for me.

17:55.642 --> 17:57.377
What are you...?

17:57.410 --> 17:59.312
You're some kind
of pervert.
No, no.

17:59.346 --> 18:02.249
No, no, no, look.
I'll give you ten, man, hey!

18:02.282 --> 18:03.516
Damn!

18:09.189 --> 18:10.890
Can I help you?

18:12.892 --> 18:13.893
Hey, baby.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.262
How you doing?

18:15.295 --> 18:16.663
If that's what
my mother looks like

18:16.696 --> 18:18.631
catching my father
with another job,

18:18.665 --> 18:20.600
it's no wonder he never had
another woman.

18:20.633 --> 18:21.701
What you doing here?

18:21.734 --> 18:23.603
I'm working.

18:23.636 --> 18:24.737
What are you doing here?

18:24.771 --> 18:26.506
Relaxing?

18:26.539 --> 18:27.607
Drew and Tanya...

18:27.640 --> 18:28.875
Yeah, Drew and Tanya.

18:28.908 --> 18:30.810
Now you're bribing
your own kids?

18:30.843 --> 18:32.879
You should be
ashamed or yourself.

18:32.912 --> 18:34.747
And you only gave them
ten measly dollars.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.283
You could've at least
gave them $20.

18:36.316 --> 18:37.917
How did you know
I was going to be here?

18:37.950 --> 18:41.754
Who do you think called for
you to pick up the package?

18:41.788 --> 18:43.823
Look, I'm just trying
to make some extra money

18:43.856 --> 18:45.492
so we can get ahead, baby.

18:45.525 --> 18:47.327
Baby, how are you
gonna get ahead

18:47.360 --> 18:48.928
if your behind is
laying in a coffin?

18:48.961 --> 18:51.664
Julius, I need for
you to relax,

18:51.698 --> 18:54.367
so I can relax.
You understand?

18:54.401 --> 18:56.469
I'm sorry.

18:56.503 --> 18:58.471
I didn't know it was
that important to you.

19:01.508 --> 19:02.475
Go home.

19:02.509 --> 19:05.478
And if you're not asleep
by the time I get home,

19:05.512 --> 19:08.515
I'm gonna knock you out.

19:08.548 --> 19:10.917
No, don't kiss me, I'm in
my place of business.

19:10.950 --> 19:12.785
Well, at least let me
get the package.

19:12.819 --> 19:15.255
There is no package.

19:19.426 --> 19:21.194
Go to sleep.

19:21.228 --> 19:24.264
And I'm keeping the ten dollars.

19:24.297 --> 19:26.533
For a few days, I had something
I'd always wished for--

19:26.566 --> 19:28.401
no Caruso.

19:28.435 --> 19:30.670
But the only thing worse
than life with him,

19:30.703 --> 19:31.604
was life without him.

19:31.638 --> 19:33.740
Everybody was talking
about the fight,

19:33.773 --> 19:38.211
but I knew how it ended
before it started.

19:38.245 --> 19:39.346
Well, you did it, man.

19:39.379 --> 19:40.680
Caruso's back.

19:40.713 --> 19:42.915
Yeah, I guess I'm a real hero--

19:42.949 --> 19:45.218
Superfool.

19:46.753 --> 19:47.754
Greg?

19:47.787 --> 19:54.227
Thanks, Sandman.

19:54.261 --> 19:56.563
Give me my money.

19:56.596 --> 19:58.531
You owe me a pizza.

20:02.502 --> 20:03.636
Thank you.

20:03.670 --> 20:04.704
Thanks, nothing.

20:04.737 --> 20:05.672
You got what you wanted,

20:05.705 --> 20:06.706
I let Caruso beat me,

20:06.739 --> 20:08.308
and now I get what I want.

20:08.341 --> 20:10.410
Either I pass my math class
or it's your ass.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.681
What's he angry about?

20:14.714 --> 20:16.983
Can't he see I'm the one
in the locker?

20:18.485 --> 20:22.689
* Everybody Hates Chris. *
