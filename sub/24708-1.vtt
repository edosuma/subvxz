This has become
A nightmare, andy--
These continual postponements.

02:51.704 --> 02:54.674
I'm not startin' a diet today.
You wanna start it,
You start it yourself.

02:55.074 --> 02:57.076
Andy, we both require
Peer reinforcement.

02:57.076 --> 02:58.945
We've discussed this.
Medavoy, shut up.

02:59.245 --> 03:01.681

[ chatter on police radio ]

03:28.808 --> 03:31.644
So, uh, she got no inkling--
Russell?

03:31.644 --> 03:33.913
I don't think so.
Where you gonna do it?

03:33.913 --> 03:37.417
I'm takin' her over
To river cafeיי.
I did it in a restaurant.

Out of dessert.

03:40.420 --> 03:43.156
You don't wanna start
On that diet today, huh?
No.

03:43.156 --> 03:45.158
We're gonna have to start
Moving greg around
On a handcart.

03:45.658 --> 03:47.660
[ sipowicz ]
So, what have we got?

03:48.127 --> 03:50.496
We got a black male,
Looks about 50. Shot
Three times in the chest.

03:50.830 --> 03:54.334
That's the guy
Who found him--
Arnold cassell.

03:54.334 --> 03:57.270
He didn't happen to see
Who dropped it off?
No.

[ man on p.a., indistinct ]
[ simone ]
Excuse me.

04:00.473 --> 04:02.842
I'm detective simone.
What can you tell us
About what happened here?

04:02.842 --> 04:06.246
I was out with my dog,
And then he started
To urinate on the trunk,

04:06.246 --> 04:09.182
And then suddenly
He got very agitated.

04:09.182 --> 04:11.884
[ dog whining ]
He was pawing at it
And whimpering.

04:12.185 --> 04:14.687
Look at him. Please.
He's still very agitated.
It's okay.

04:15.188 --> 04:16.689
Sir? That's when
You looked inside--

04:17.156 --> 04:19.791
I looked inside,
And then i saw the body.

04:20.293 --> 04:22.795
And, uh, then of course
I called 911.

04:22.795 --> 04:25.932
- that trunk was moved.
- all right.
  Thanks a lot, mr. Cassell.

04:26.332 --> 04:28.935
You see them drag marks?
That trunk got dumped
Over here...

04:28.935 --> 04:30.937
And moved by hand
Over there.

04:30.937 --> 04:34.374
- you see those humps over here?
- that's bauman and giamatti
  From the 13th.

04:34.874 --> 04:36.442
You can make book
That they're the ones
That moved it.

04:36.843 --> 04:40.847
- what do you got, andy?
- we got a dump job, bauman--
  30 feet into our precinct.

04:40.847 --> 04:43.850
- i'll start the canvass.
- yeah. Lots of luck.

04:43.850 --> 04:46.886
[ simone ] excuse me.
Is that a body
In that trunk, sip?

04:47.220 --> 04:48.821
Don't ask me what's
In the trunk again.

04:48.821 --> 04:50.790
Some lucky break
For you guys, huh, bauman?
[ horn honks ]

04:51.190 --> 04:52.992
[ brakes squealing ]
It got dragged clear out
Of your jurisdiction.

04:53.226 --> 04:56.329
-[ giamatti ]
 We resent that inference.
- [ no audible dialogue ]

04:56.329 --> 04:58.898
You just lost yourselves help
Canvassing all these witnesses.

04:58.898 --> 05:00.900
Oh, now that's
A laugh riot, bauman.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.902
You keep crackin' wise,
I'll put you in there
With the stiff.

05:03.403 --> 05:06.239
He got no i.d.
The bottom of the trunk
Is lined with the sundaypost.

05:06.539 --> 05:09.475
All right. How about this?
This driver saw the trunk
Dumped,

05:09.475 --> 05:11.644
And he saw it loaded
Onto a van on 14th street.

05:11.878 --> 05:14.714
[ driver ]
Fourteenth and avenue "c."
How likely is that--

05:15.048 --> 05:17.183
To see the thing get
Picked up and dumped off
On the same bus run?

05:17.183 --> 05:19.552
Can you tell us anything
About the people who did it?
[ siren wails ]

05:19.552 --> 05:23.823
Two black guys, average height.
Looked like they were
In their 20s.

05:23.823 --> 05:27.593
It was a beat-up chevy van--
Light brown, no plates.

05:27.593 --> 05:30.963
I got his pedigree.
Thanks a lot for stoppin'.

05:31.397 --> 05:34.233

  Or run her over.

05:34.567 --> 05:36.936
- bobby, here's a couple photos
  From the d.o.a.
- yeah.

05:37.270 --> 05:39.205
What do you say
If we actually
Clear this case, huh?

05:39.572 --> 05:41.941
You guys wanna take a ride
With us over to 14th street?
Maybe we can make an i.d.

05:42.241 --> 05:45.078
- nah.
- you got it covered.

05:45.078 --> 05:47.013
They're still workin' off
The lord's instructions--

05:47.013 --> 05:49.949
Do nothing
Till i return to earth.

05:49.949 --> 05:52.018
You puttin' on
A little weight,
Medavoy?

05:52.118 --> 05:54.987
Kiss my ass, giamatti.
Give it a big smooch.

07:29.315 --> 07:31.551
Andy, what's up?
What are you workin' on?

07:32.552 --> 07:34.554
I'm concerned
With the baby.

07:34.554 --> 07:36.556
Why, he don't feel good?
Uh--

07:36.556 --> 07:40.760
She had him taken in
For some tests. He--
He got no resistance.

07:41.227 --> 07:43.296
What, to colds?
He don't fight 'em off.

07:43.796 --> 07:46.365
He's six months old.
 He's had seven colds.

07:46.365 --> 07:48.868
Sylvia took him in
For the tests
Unbeknownst to me.

07:48.868 --> 07:50.803
-when are you supposed
 To find out about that?
- later on.

07:51.237 --> 07:52.738
She's got us goin' in
To see his doctor.

At the house.

09:36.074 --> 09:37.992
[ murmurs ]

09:38.493 --> 09:40.612
This is laila edmonds, bobby.
She recognized the polaroid.

09:40.612 --> 09:43.915
Tell him what you know,
Ma'am.
His name was afro.

09:43.915 --> 09:47.285
Do you know what his last name
Was, miss edmonds?
No. He was just "afro."

09:47.786 --> 09:49.788
I don't know why somebody
Would want to do this
To him.

09:49.788 --> 09:52.290
You know where
This afro lives?
Down the street a little.

09:52.791 --> 09:54.793
My son knows.
Arthur.

09:56.594 --> 09:59.964
Miss edmonds, were you on
The street here when this man
Was running away from us?

09:59.964 --> 10:02.767
No, i wasn't. I heard
He took a shot at you.

10:02.767 --> 10:05.770
Arthur, somebody
Killed afro.
Is that right?

10:05.770 --> 10:07.772
Your mom says maybe you know
Where this afro lived.

10:08.273 --> 10:09.724
Yeah. Yeah, just
Down the block.

10:09.724 --> 10:12.310
You wanna
Point it out to us?
Yeah, okay.

10:12.811 --> 10:14.562
Andy.

10:14.562 --> 10:19.450
Bobby, when i showed this kid
The picture, he said he didn't
Know the d.o.a.

10:19.818 --> 10:21.870
I guess i didn't get
A good look before.

10:21.870 --> 10:24.405
Yeah, that happens a lot.
Come on.

10:27.041 --> 10:29.460
Excuse me, ma'am. Police.
I need to ask you
Some questions.

10:29.961 --> 10:31.796
Did you see what happened
On the street before?
No.

10:31.796 --> 10:33.715
How about this guy?
You ever seen him?
No. Sorry.

10:33.715 --> 10:37.001
Hey.

10:37.001 --> 10:38.837
That arthur
With the other cops--
He was in on it.

10:38.837 --> 10:41.756
On what?
What happened to afro.

10:41.756 --> 10:44.259
Last night,
Him and two other guys
Were carrying the trunk...

10:44.259 --> 10:46.761
In the picture
That you showed
Out of afro's building.

10:46.761 --> 10:50.014
What's your name?
It's got nothin'
To do with me.

10:50.014 --> 10:52.350
But that arthur--
He was a part of it.

10:57.355 --> 10:59.858
[ sirens wails ]

11:01.693 --> 11:04.696
[ woman ]
No warrant-- i don't need
To let you be lookin' around.

11:04.696 --> 11:06.831
C.s.u.'s on the way.
I know my rights.

11:07.332 --> 11:10.201
[ simone ]
We appreciate the cooperation.
He was in the vietnam war.

11:10.201 --> 11:13.705
Need help with your garbage
Or the snow, he'd just
Do that for you.

11:13.705 --> 11:15.623
I got james
Keepin' an eye on arthur.

11:16.124 --> 11:19.210
Wore that hat and pin for
Africa, but never put it in
Your face like some of 'em.

11:19.210 --> 11:21.429
- did afro use drugs?
- i wouldn't know about that.

11:21.429 --> 11:25.183
Bobby.
This could be a handle
Off the footlocker.

11:25.683 --> 11:28.603
This looks like
The rest of the newspaper
We found on the body.

11:29.103 --> 11:31.890
Anything in here
Belongs to me.
This is my building.

11:31.890 --> 11:36.311
You want half the sundaypost?
Well, afro got no relatives,
And he owed me money.

11:36.311 --> 11:38.980
We're lookin' for evidence,
Rosalie. Now, if somebody
Were to come back in...

11:38.980 --> 11:41.532
After we seal the place up,
That'd be up to them.

11:41.799 --> 11:43.534
Any money in here
Is mine.

11:43.534 --> 11:45.320
I don't usually hit women,
But i don't mind,

11:45.320 --> 11:47.705
'Cause when they hit back,
It don't really
Amount to much.

11:48.206 --> 11:50.491
-he threatened me!
- calm down, rosalie.

11:50.742 --> 11:52.493
You guys'll wait
For c.s.u.?
Yeah.

11:52.493 --> 11:55.246
Andy, we should go
Talk to arthur.
Yeah.

11:55.246 --> 11:58.132
Good luck with the toss.

11:58.132 --> 12:01.135
Get abused
For cooperation.

12:01.135 --> 12:05.640
[ martinez ]
That's all you can remember?
Okay, uh--

12:07.475 --> 12:10.478
Did you find
Any clues up there?
We found some things.

12:10.478 --> 12:13.932
I'm wondering if maybe
We can talk a little more at
The station house, miss edmonds.

12:13.932 --> 12:15.900
I don't know how much more
We can tell you.

12:15.900 --> 12:17.769
Actually, we probably got
All we need from you.

12:17.769 --> 12:22.073
Maybe we can get arthur here
To give us a little more
On afro's background.

12:22.073 --> 12:25.360
Well, whatever we can do
To help you catch
Whoever did this.

12:25.360 --> 12:27.695
We'll be glad to.
Good. What do you
Say, arthur?

12:27.695 --> 12:30.665
A little more
Background there

What do you think
Happened to andy?
I don't know.

13:06.834 --> 13:09.337
He said he wasn't
Short of breath.
Right.

13:09.337 --> 13:12.840
You know, i shouldn't scapegoat
Him on my weight gain.
Uh-huh.

Another factor's
My new apartment--
Havin' my own kitchen.

Yeah, availability
Of snacks.

James, would you consider
Sharin' a diet with me?

13:22.233 --> 13:24.936
Just for gettin' me started.
Hey, greg, i'm runnin'
For delegate.

13:24.936 --> 13:26.938
I talk with the guys
All the time over doughnuts.

13:27.438 --> 13:29.440
Yeah. Hang back,
They could take it
For uppity.

That gina's
Some cute girl, huh?

13:32.360 --> 13:35.580
The new p.a.a. In anticrime.
Yeah. She seems
Very appealing.

13:35.580 --> 13:38.416
Anticrime gets her,
And we get roseanne.

13:38.916 --> 13:41.202
Which is a reference
To what, james?
Our new p.a.a.

13:41.202 --> 13:44.422
- but roseanne in what sense?
- greg, what are you
  Gettin' all excited about?

13:44.922 --> 13:47.008
Because the new p.a.a.
Carries some extra poundage,

13:47.008 --> 13:48.843
She's disqualified
From the human community?

13:48.843 --> 13:51.679
Absolutely not.
I'll tell ya, james.

13:51.679 --> 13:53.681
It's an accumulation
Of remarks over
The course of a day...

13:54.182 --> 13:56.184
That contribute
To an atmosphere
And an attitude.

13:56.184 --> 13:58.186
And i wish people
Would realize.

13:58.186 --> 13:59.971
Fine. I'd never say that
To her face, greg.

  Fifteenth detective squad.

14:26.247 --> 14:30.551
So andy got shot at?
Yeah. We got a tip the dump job
Was loaded up on 14th street.

14:30.551 --> 14:33.805
We go around there
To show the picture. This guy
Just books off the street.

14:33.805 --> 14:35.973
He throws two shots at andy
Inside a building.

14:35.973 --> 14:38.259
We chased him,
But he got away.
Who'd you bring back?

14:38.760 --> 14:42.647
There was a woman on canvass
That made him one of the guys
Who put the d.o.a. In the van.

14:42.647 --> 14:44.766
He don't know
We like him yet.
Andy's okay?

14:46.184 --> 14:47.985
Yeah.

14:52.657 --> 14:54.992
Are you readin' stuff
Off my desk here?

14:54.992 --> 14:57.445
If you don't want it read, pal,
Don't leave it written.

14:57.445 --> 15:01.199
[ scoffs ] do you wanna
Sit in on this with us?
Yeah, all right.

15:01.199 --> 15:05.119
Now, andy didn't get
Chest pains or something,
Did he?

15:05.119 --> 15:08.923
No. He's okay.
No? 'Cause he didn't
Go after that guy.

15:08.923 --> 15:12.426
He's half worried about theo.
They're runnin' some kind
Of tests on him.

15:12.426 --> 15:15.096
- 'cause he gets
  So many colds?
- yes.

15:15.096 --> 15:17.098
Are they concerned?
Should i call sylvia?

15:17.598 --> 15:19.600
I don't know.
I didn't wanna push him
With it, you know?

15:19.600 --> 15:22.603
So andy was probably
Just halfway distracted.

15:22.603 --> 15:25.056
[ door opens ]

15:28.059 --> 15:31.195
- arthur says he didn't really

- that's right.

15:32.613 --> 15:35.616
Yeah.

15:35.616 --> 15:39.620
I'm gonna tell you somethin'
Up front, arthur. We know
You had dealings with afro.

15:39.620 --> 15:43.374
Now, if you were involved
With something that had
A bad outcome there,

15:43.374 --> 15:45.743
We're absolutely prepared
To hear what happened.

15:45.743 --> 15:48.246
You gotta put it into the proper
Light. Do not stand there
And lie to us, okay?

15:48.246 --> 15:52.216
- i wasn't involved.
- arthur, this case
  Is coming into place.

15:52.216 --> 15:56.337
Now, we know that you
Helped carry afro's body
Out of his apartment.

15:56.337 --> 15:58.089
We know that.
Oh, man.

15:58.089 --> 16:00.508
So that leads me to believe
Either one of two things--

16:00.508 --> 16:02.393
You killed him,
Or somebody else did it.

16:02.393 --> 16:05.897
For whatever reason,
You're covering for 'em.
Oh, man! Oh, man!

16:05.897 --> 16:07.732
And it'd better be
A good reason there,
Arthur.

16:07.732 --> 16:10.685
Because with
The evidence we have here--
The eyewitness testimony--

16:11.185 --> 16:12.987
Right now, it'syourarm
That's lookin' at that needle.

16:12.987 --> 16:17.074
Arthur. You are not
Under arrest here, okay?

16:17.074 --> 16:20.111
Now sit down
And tell us what happened.

To do with it.

- she didn't?
- oh, she's gonna kill me
  When she finds this out.

- [ breathes deeply ] does she
  Have to find this out?
- arthur, tell us what happened.

He's flashin' around
All this money
Off his veteran check.

16:54.729 --> 16:57.565
How come he's gotta flash
That money around like that?
That's just stupid.

To his place-- this, uh,

17:01.452 --> 17:03.788
Yeah.
You went up there
With 'em?

17:03.788 --> 17:05.873
No. 'Cause i know
What hector's like.

Tried to read the newspaper.

Now, what time was this?
How long were you home?

17:12.914 --> 17:15.916
It was about, uh,
10:30 last night.

From up the street, like,
Maybe 20 minutes later.

Over at afro's.

- help 'em.

And fit him in the trunk.

About killin' him?

- hector's crazy.

 And put him in rodney's van.

But i told rodney
I'm not touchin' that.

And then hector drops his end
And the handle breaks, so then
I had to help 'em.

26:04.060 --> 26:06.762
- whereabouts?
- couple of places.

26:06.762 --> 26:09.482
-were you up
 On 14th street?
- a little while.

26:09.482 --> 26:12.485
Where you hangin' with hector,
Rodney, the little while
You were up there?

26:12.485 --> 26:15.321
- hangin' with afro?
- nope.

26:15.321 --> 26:17.606
No?
Arthur say i was?

26:17.606 --> 26:21.444
You think about who gave you up,
Rodney, not gettin' in front
Of this homicide.

26:21.444 --> 26:23.863
We know that you were
Involved with killing afro.

26:23.863 --> 26:26.532
Arthur can't put a gun
In anyone's hands, rodney.

26:26.532 --> 26:28.951
But you're gonna do this,
Or either hector is.

26:29.251 --> 26:32.338
I didn't kill nobody!
We got eyewitnesses
That put you there, rodney--

26:32.338 --> 26:34.507
During and after the fact.

26:34.507 --> 26:37.543
If hector pulled the trigger,
You gotta get that out.

26:37.543 --> 26:39.962
Rat him out,
Then do time with hector?

26:39.962 --> 26:41.964
Who says you're gonna be
In the same joint?

26:41.964 --> 26:46.435
If hector killed afro, rodney,
There must be some reason
That you stood by.

26:46.435 --> 26:48.721
Maybe you were in fear
For your life.

26:49.221 --> 26:53.559
[ scoffs ]
Man, believe that--
What i seen hector do.

26:53.559 --> 26:55.478
These other things
That you saw,

26:55.978 --> 26:58.981
You didn't try to stop 'em
'Cause they were just
Drug dealers, right?

26:58.981 --> 27:01.984
Hector takin' 'em off.
Here, he was takin' off
An innocent guy.

27:02.485 --> 27:06.322
You tried to stop him,
But you were in fear
For your life.

27:13.746 --> 27:16.415
He's crazy.

27:16.415 --> 27:18.717
You don't know
How crazy he is.

27:18.717 --> 27:20.970
You explain how many people
Hector killed,

27:20.970 --> 27:23.088
Where he created
A fear in you,

27:23.088 --> 27:25.841
The d.a.'s
Gonna understand that.

27:25.841 --> 27:28.344
Like when he shot
Them lupones.

27:28.344 --> 27:31.480
They were givin' it up,
But he did 'em anyway.
It was needless.

27:31.480 --> 27:33.482
Anybody else?
Drug rip-offs.

27:33.482 --> 27:35.768
Dino thompson--
He did him.

27:35.768 --> 27:37.903
He gets a rush off of it.

27:37.903 --> 27:40.356
He'll shoot it out with you.
He says it all the time.

27:40.356 --> 27:42.324
Five-o come,
He's drawin' down.

27:42.324 --> 27:45.194
Just tell us where we can
Look for hector, rodney.

27:45.194 --> 27:47.496
We'll take care of him
Drawin' down.

27:49.999 --> 27:52.334
I gotta give up
That other stuff too?
Yeah.

27:52.334 --> 27:54.620
You just, uh, compose
Your thoughts a little.

28:02.878 --> 28:05.014
I gotta meet sylvia
At the doctor's.

28:05.014 --> 28:07.516
I can stay.
Yeah? Thanks.

28:07.516 --> 28:11.520
Yeah. Then, uh, maybe i'll take
Greg and james-- we'll go
Look for this hector.

28:11.520 --> 28:14.523
I'll-- i'll be back.
Wait for me.

28:15.024 --> 28:17.026
Well, good luck, andy.

28:20.696 --> 28:22.698
How's it goin'?
Hi.

28:24.533 --> 28:30.039
- uh--
- so, um, what'd you get
  From rodney speck?

28:30.039 --> 28:32.374
He's gonna give up a statement,
Point us to the other guy.

28:36.078 --> 28:38.581
Good.

28:42.501 --> 28:46.889
- how's this gonna work?
- i've got a mouth full
  Of marbles.

28:46.889 --> 28:51.977
I tell you, i should just get
Back in the bag for being
A no kind of detective.

28:51.977 --> 28:54.847
-yeah? They should bust you
  Back to cop?
- yeah.

28:57.683 --> 28:59.518
I just never figured it
To go like this, diane.

29:03.188 --> 29:07.409
I'm sorry i couldn't give you
An answer right away.
Don't be sorry.

29:08.694 --> 29:11.530
I'll try to think fast.
[ chuckles ]

29:17.419 --> 29:20.606
???? [ woman vocalizing ]

29:31.300 --> 29:33.435
- it's all good news.
- [ sighs ] thank god.

29:33.435 --> 29:36.772
- all the tests are back?
- yeah, they're all back.

29:36.772 --> 29:40.809
I've told sylvia that these
Are not dangerous infections
Theo was getting.

29:40.809 --> 29:43.979
The worry was that he might
Have some problem that was
Lowering his resistance.

29:43.979 --> 29:47.199
This is the immune problem?
And his immune system
Is fine.

29:47.199 --> 29:50.119
His i.g.g. Is normal.
 His i.g.a. Is normal.

29:50.119 --> 29:52.371
He's a normal baby
Who's had a bunch of colds.

29:52.371 --> 29:54.456
Doctor,
We're so grateful.

29:54.456 --> 29:56.492
To be truthful, detective,

29:56.492 --> 29:59.328
With another baby,
I don't think i'd have
Ordered these tests yet.

29:59.328 --> 30:02.464
But i know, from sylvia,
That you're very concerned
About theo's well-being.

30:02.464 --> 30:05.250
Seven colds
In the last six months.

30:05.751 --> 30:09.805
Which is very understandable
In view of your recent loss.

30:09.805 --> 30:13.142
You a baby doctor
Or a psychiatrist?
Andy.

30:13.142 --> 30:16.812
I'm a baby doctor
Who's telling you
This son is healthy...

30:16.812 --> 30:21.266
And that happy children grow up
In an atmosphere of trust.

30:21.266 --> 30:23.185
Which includes
Believing in the future...

30:23.686 --> 30:26.822
Even though we know
There are no guarantees.

30:28.824 --> 30:30.826
I guess that makes sense.

30:33.445 --> 30:36.448
Thank you.
Enjoy your baby.

30:37.282 --> 30:40.336
Thanks for your interest.

Uh, the colds themselves--

31:44.016 --> 31:46.268
He says he was never really
Even worried about them.

My son made it over
From storage.

32:19.768 --> 32:21.603
Didn't know
He rented it out.

32:22.104 --> 32:24.389
This is where hector is?
To the left.

32:24.389 --> 32:26.725
No second exit
Because of storage.

With the buildin' inspectors.

The shots at, hector.

Nobody's comin' in here.
You get through me, you're
Outside on the streets.

I don't know, hector.
I'm hearin' a lot of
Words here, you know?

34:54.170 --> 34:56.672
You don't even
Get to your feet.

34:57.674 --> 34:59.510
Is it like this, hector--

34:59.510 --> 35:03.347
When you got the drop,
You throw shots,
Or else you just talk?

35:03.347 --> 35:05.015
Kiss my ass, pig.

35:05.015 --> 35:07.735
Talk and don't even stand up
With the window
Right over there.

35:07.735 --> 35:12.322
You hid... Like a little woman.
We both gonna know that.

35:14.441 --> 35:16.944
I was afraid, hector.
[ laughs ]

35:16.944 --> 35:19.947
I used to figure you went
When your time came,
And no point worrying.

35:19.947 --> 35:22.449
Now i'm afraid to die.

You don't wanna go
For the window?

I want a lawyer!

35:48.275 --> 35:51.612
Sure, hector.
Two eyewitnesses.

35:51.612 --> 35:54.114
We can live without
Your statement.

35:54.114 --> 35:56.617
But you just remember this,
Sweetheart.

35:57.117 --> 35:59.119

Start tomorrow.

Rather keep it in-house.

40:05.949 --> 40:09.703
They got this stuff from
That murdered dealer's
Place, huh?

40:09.703 --> 40:12.406
That, uh, vasquez?
At least he died in shape.

40:12.406 --> 40:15.325
Yeah.
[ chuckles ]

40:15.325 --> 40:19.212
- abby sullivan.
- yeah. Greg medavoy.

40:19.212 --> 40:21.498
Just got transferred to rip.

40:21.498 --> 40:24.251
I-i'm with the squad.

40:24.751 --> 40:27.471
Hope property
Never releases this stuff.
Yeah. [ chuckles ]

40:29.473 --> 40:32.059
Uh, good to meet you,
Abby.

40:32.059 --> 40:35.512
- you're not gonna work out?
- nah, uh-uh.

40:35.812 --> 40:38.432
Although, you know, i--
I'm definitely thinkin'
Of tonin' up.

40:38.432 --> 40:40.350
Takin' off some pounds.

40:40.350 --> 40:43.770
Yeah. I've even got a bet
Goin' with a friend, you know?

40:43.770 --> 40:45.522
Uh, weight-loss competition.

40:45.522 --> 40:49.192
Long trip-- small steps.
Yeah.

40:49.192 --> 40:53.196
Yeah. I like that.
That's, uh--

40:53.196 --> 40:55.082
That's better than
Old dogs-- new tricks.

40:55.082 --> 40:57.033
[ chuckles ]

40:57.033 --> 41:00.253
See ya.

41:08.678 --> 41:11.681
Okay. Okay, i guess we'll
Talk about all this
In the morning.

41:11.681 --> 41:13.683
Thank you. Yeah.

41:13.683 --> 41:17.604
What'd the lawyer say?

41:17.604 --> 41:20.474
She left me the building.

41:20.474 --> 41:22.476
I guess there's a bunch
Of notes against it.

41:22.476 --> 41:26.980
Oh, and here i was thinking
You might be rich.
Yeah, huh?

41:26.980 --> 41:30.484
Would that have
Moved me up?

41:32.452 --> 41:34.454
[ clears throat ]
Bobby?

41:34.454 --> 41:36.323
What about, like,
An open-ended engagement?

41:36.323 --> 41:39.793
[ scoffs ]

41:39.793 --> 41:42.796
You mean, like, we're engaged
But not to be married?

41:42.796 --> 41:44.664
My mom and dougie still
Need a lot of my attention.

41:44.664 --> 41:47.167
I'm just gettin' started
At the bureau, plus--

41:47.167 --> 41:49.669
[ breathes deeply ]
You're not supposed
To make life decisions...

41:49.669 --> 41:51.505
Until you've got
Some time sober.

41:51.505 --> 41:54.424
That's for 12 months, diane.
You already got 18.

41:54.424 --> 41:58.228
Yeah, well, just worrying
About this, i thought about
Drinkin' a few times.

41:58.228 --> 42:00.680
Oh, well, there it is.

42:01.181 --> 42:04.184
Th-that's the closeout, right?
I mean, i keep up after that,
I'm a jerk.

42:05.519 --> 42:07.988
I'm trying to be honest
About my feelings.

42:08.488 --> 42:10.323
Diane, just say
"i don't want to."

42:10.323 --> 42:12.859
I'm saying doing it now
Doesn't feel right.
Don't tell me what to say.

42:12.859 --> 42:15.028
Okay.

42:15.028 --> 42:17.280
[ sighs ]

42:21.668 --> 42:25.872
-look what it's already
 Done to us.
-yeah? Well, let's kick its ass.

42:54.284 --> 42:56.286
[ sighs ]

42:56.286 --> 42:59.239
So, it was 'cause of me
You had him run those tests?

42:59.239 --> 43:02.042
Andy, you lost a son.

43:05.629 --> 43:08.548
I keep being afraid
Something's gonna
Happen to him,

43:08.548 --> 43:11.551
Or it'll happen to me
And i won't have been able
To keep care of you.

43:14.554 --> 43:17.057
[ sighs ]
I, uh,

43:17.057 --> 43:19.559
Wanna take
Some weight off.

43:19.559 --> 43:21.895
And then he gets sick,
And i'm too worried
To start the diet.

43:21.895 --> 43:24.564
But now we know
They're just colds.

43:26.399 --> 43:30.353
There,
I definitely feel better--
His clean bill of health.

43:31.855 --> 43:34.858
And... Today,
I went after a guy.

43:36.359 --> 43:39.362
I been concerned
I'll be shot.

43:39.362 --> 43:41.865
But today,
I held my end up,

43:41.865 --> 43:44.367
And i didn't
Let bobby down.

43:44.367 --> 43:46.453
So that's progress too.

43:54.094 --> 43:56.096
Remember making love?

43:58.598 --> 44:00.600
What are you suggesting?
[ chuckles ]

44:13.146 --> 44:15.148
I'd hate to wake him up.

44:17.651 --> 44:20.654
Well, just don't beat your chest
And do your jungle yell.

44:24.157 --> 44:27.661
Yeah. I guess
I could leave that out.

44:27.661 --> 44:29.963
