00:04.338 --> 00:05.874
[Juliet] Jack?

00:09.218 --> 00:10.594
Jack!

00:16.726 --> 00:18.057
Jack?

00:20.938 --> 00:23.475
Jack, I need you to wake up.

00:25.234 --> 00:26.519
Jack!

00:26.611 --> 00:28.897
Can you hear me?

00:33.701 --> 00:35.157
You OK?

00:35.244 --> 00:37.030
[people shouting]

00:37.121 --> 00:40.204
- [Bernard] | just want to know why.
- What happened?

00:40.291 --> 00:42.373
[Rose] He knows something.

00:42.460 --> 00:45.042
- I want the truth!
- I don't know.

00:45.129 --> 00:47.791
I don't know why, but there's no signal.

00:47.882 --> 00:50.715
There was a signal
when you called them last night.

00:50.801 --> 00:53.338
So, what, now they're just ignoring us?

00:53.429 --> 00:55.920
How are we supposed to know?

00:56.015 --> 00:59.633
- We're not on the bloody boat, are we?
- Just watch your tone, Red.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.934
- Ijust want to know why...
- Hey.

01:02.021 --> 01:03.886
Everybody needs to calm down, OK?

01:03.981 --> 01:08.850
- Jack, these people are lying to us!
- I know they're lying. I know it.

01:08.945 --> 01:12.529
But sooner or later, their people
are gonna come back for them.

01:12.615 --> 01:16.199
And when they do,
we'll be waiting for them.

01:16.285 --> 01:18.697
- Unless they run off again.
- Listen to me...

01:18.829 --> 01:21.491
- Jack, are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:22.917 --> 01:26.910
We just have to be patient, OK?
I've gotten us this far.

01:27.004 --> 01:30.417
I said I was gonna get us
off the island, all of us.

01:31.342 --> 01:33.628
I promised that I would.

01:36.222 --> 01:37.507
Jack!

01:37.598 --> 01:39.179
Jack!

01:39.934 --> 01:41.549
Jack.

01:41.686 --> 01:43.847
Jack.

01:43.980 --> 01:45.186
Jack!

01:49.193 --> 01:51.855
[phone ringing]

02:03.624 --> 02:05.831
- Hello?
- [woman] Dr. Shephard?

02:05.918 --> 02:09.001
Just conﬁrming your 11:00 consult
with Ms. Berenberg.

02:09.088 --> 02:12.546
It was moved up yesterday. / know
how you are with your calendar...

02:12.633 --> 02:16.217
Yeah. Yeah, I remember, Jane. l'll...

02:16.345 --> 02:19.462
- I'll be in there. All right, bye.
- Thank you, Doctor.

02:38.367 --> 02:41.279
Ow. Son of a bitch.

02:54.633 --> 02:56.248
[beeps]

03:03.392 --> 03:04.677
A-Rod.

03:07.938 --> 03:10.429
[shower running]

03:15.946 --> 03:17.277
Morning.

03:17.406 --> 03:18.862
[woman] Morning yourself.

03:18.949 --> 03:20.814
I bought you a razor.

03:21.535 --> 03:24.402
- What, you don't like the scruff?
- [laughs]

03:24.497 --> 03:26.658
Razor's by the sink, Jack.

03:33.464 --> 03:35.625
[shower shuts off]

03:44.517 --> 03:45.973
Morning.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.710
"Alice took out the fan,
and as the hall was very hot

04:18.843 --> 04:22.882
she kept fanning herself all the time
she went on talking.

04:23.013 --> 04:26.005
'Dear, dear, how queer
everything is today.

04:26.100 --> 04:29.592
And yesterday things went on
just as usual.

04:29.687 --> 04:32.804
I wonder if I'd been changed
in the night.

04:32.898 --> 04:36.186
Let me think, was I the same
when I got up this morning?

04:42.867 --> 04:46.701
But if I'm not the same, the next
question is who in the world am I?

04:47.788 --> 04:50.279
Ah, that's the great puzzle."'

05:20.029 --> 05:21.735
You're a natural.

05:22.490 --> 05:23.980
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

05:25.242 --> 05:27.233
My old man used to read me that story.

05:27.369 --> 05:28.575
Really?

05:29.413 --> 05:30.994
What?

05:32.541 --> 05:35.749
It's just sweet hearing you say
nice things about your dad.

05:37.713 --> 05:40.045
I don't say nice things about my dad?

05:42.009 --> 05:44.876
Well, he was a good storyteller,
I'll give him that.

05:49.058 --> 05:50.389
Hey.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.056
You OK?

05:55.981 --> 05:57.687
Yeah.

05:57.775 --> 06:00.767
lt'sjust, l...
I love seeing you with him.

06:03.948 --> 06:06.280
I'm so glad you changed your mind.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.660
I'm so glad that you're here.

06:14.124 --> 06:15.705
Me, too.

06:30.224 --> 06:31.964
[Kate laughs]

06:35.479 --> 06:37.936
Keep him in the shade.
I'll get him some water.

06:38.023 --> 06:40.765
- Give him some air, guys.
- [gaSpS]

06:40.859 --> 06:42.144
You OK?

06:42.236 --> 06:43.817
Yeah.

06:44.822 --> 06:46.983
I'm fine. I'm good, I'm good.

06:47.491 --> 06:49.573
- What happened?
- He passed out.

06:49.702 --> 06:52.318
- You fainted?
- I'm fine. I'm just...

06:52.454 --> 06:54.706
...a little dehydrated.

06:54.790 --> 06:58.123
- You're not OK. You're burning up.
- I'm fine, ljust...

06:58.210 --> 07:00.667
ljust need to get a little rest.

07:00.796 --> 07:02.502
- Jack.
- I'm fine.

07:08.846 --> 07:10.256
[Claire gasps]

07:10.347 --> 07:13.054
- You OK?
- Yeah, just a bit woozy.

07:13.183 --> 07:16.391
- How's your head?
- It's better. Bit of a headache,

07:16.520 --> 07:19.102
but at least I'm not
seeing things anymore.

07:19.189 --> 07:22.397
- Yeah? What'd you see?
- Back off, Donger.

07:22.484 --> 07:25.772
- Just making conversation.
- Well, let's make some time.

07:25.863 --> 07:28.855
I wanna cover more ground
before we gotta camp tonight.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.782
We hoof it, we can make it
to the beach by noon tomorrow.

07:31.869 --> 07:33.951
- [distant voices]
- [noises]

07:34.038 --> 07:36.654
[distant shouting]

07:41.211 --> 07:42.792
What?

07:43.047 --> 07:44.412
Hey.

07:46.425 --> 07:49.212
- Hey!
- Who's Danielle and Karl?

07:50.387 --> 07:53.174
You mean Rousseau,
the French woman?

07:56.477 --> 07:58.718
[Aaron cries]

08:06.779 --> 08:08.315
[flies buzzing]

08:08.405 --> 08:09.656
Oh, my God.

08:11.617 --> 08:13.528
Is this your French woman?

08:23.253 --> 08:24.288
Karl.

08:25.798 --> 08:27.880
How'd you know they were down there?

08:30.094 --> 08:31.925
Your buddies do this?

08:33.347 --> 08:35.212
They're not my buddies, man.

08:36.725 --> 08:38.181
I didn't sign up for this.

08:40.938 --> 08:43.600
Can we just get out of here?
Can we just go?

08:43.691 --> 08:45.852
Yeah, yeah, of course.
But don't worry.

08:45.943 --> 08:49.902
Once we get back to the beach,
everything's gonna be fine. All right?

08:51.990 --> 08:53.946
Come on. Let's go.

09:05.129 --> 09:06.994
[groans]

09:07.131 --> 09:08.996
I hate being sick.

09:09.091 --> 09:12.458
- What do you think it is?
- lt's food poisoning.

09:13.053 --> 09:16.545
- What makes you think that?
- I've got some cramping.

09:16.640 --> 09:19.052
l'm dehydrated, nausea.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.268
I respectfully disagree.

09:23.355 --> 09:24.856
Do you?

09:24.982 --> 09:27.564
You wanna lift your shirt up?

09:31.071 --> 09:34.438
If it's food poisoning,
you got nothing to worry about.

09:55.053 --> 09:57.135
It's your appendix, Jack.

09:59.141 --> 10:01.132
When did the pain start?

10:02.603 --> 10:05.345
- Yesterday.
- Has it ruptured?

10:06.523 --> 10:07.683
Not yet.

10:09.693 --> 10:11.024
Well...

10:12.571 --> 10:15.404
...I guess we're just gonna
have to take it out.

10:21.038 --> 10:23.575
Do you remember
where the medical station is?

10:23.707 --> 10:26.699
- Yes, I remember.
- I need you to get these instruments.

10:26.835 --> 10:29.372
You'll find them in the drawers
in the exam room.

10:29.463 --> 10:30.919
Clamps? Sutures?

10:31.048 --> 10:33.460
Juliet, I don't know
what these look like.

10:33.550 --> 10:36.758
I can help you. I'm familiar
with surgical instruments.

10:36.887 --> 10:38.798
I thought you were a physicist.

10:38.889 --> 10:42.052
Yeah, well, I've done
some animal autopsies, too, so...

10:42.142 --> 10:44.007
- No.
- We can't trust them.

10:44.102 --> 10:47.560
I told you. They're convinced
we're trying to kill them.

10:47.648 --> 10:50.890
- Might as well keep playing the part.
- Damn it, Charlotte.

10:50.984 --> 10:55.398
That right there. Your attitude.
You have a very bad attitude.

10:55.489 --> 10:57.855
lt's exactly why they don't trust us.

10:57.950 --> 10:59.906
Come on.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.325
Juliet, please.

11:02.412 --> 11:05.449
Don't blame us for this,
for whatever is happening.

11:05.541 --> 11:09.204
We're scientists. We don't want
anyone to get hurt. We want to help.

11:09.294 --> 11:10.670
Please let us help.

11:14.800 --> 11:18.008
Either of them tries to run,
shoot them in the leg.

11:19.513 --> 11:22.004
- Get back here as fast as you can.
- OK.

11:22.099 --> 11:23.339
Thank you.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.270
We need to create a sterile environment.

11:27.354 --> 11:31.313
Find a hard surface, wash it down,
gather as many tarps as you can.

11:32.609 --> 11:34.725
Wait, Juliet.

11:34.820 --> 11:38.904
If everything is at the medical station,
why don't we bring Jack there?

11:38.991 --> 11:42.449
If we move him, there's a good chance
his appendix will rupture.

11:42.578 --> 11:45.365
And if that happens, he's gonna die.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.306
Don't even think about it.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.051
What?

12:06.727 --> 12:09.639
Don't look at her. Don't talk to her.

12:10.606 --> 12:12.892
Don't mess with her.

12:13.650 --> 12:15.982
You got a restraining order.
Twenty feet.

12:16.111 --> 12:19.353
- What are you, her big brother?
- No.

12:19.489 --> 12:23.448
I'm the guy who'll put a boot in your
face unless you say, "Yeah, I get ya."

12:24.536 --> 12:26.072
Yeah. I get ya.

12:37.633 --> 12:40.466
Honey, I am sure
Jack is gonna be OK.

12:41.428 --> 12:45.421
An appendectomy is just about the most
common kind of surgery there is.

12:45.557 --> 12:50.347
That is not what I was thinking about.
l was thinking why did he get sick?

12:50.479 --> 12:52.344
Why? It's just bad luck.

12:52.439 --> 12:55.055
The day before we're all
supposed to be rescued,

12:55.192 --> 12:56.898
the person that we count on most

12:57.027 --> 12:59.689
comes down
with a life-threatening condition,

12:59.780 --> 13:02.943
- you're chalking that up to bad luck?
- What are you saying?

13:03.033 --> 13:07.026
Jack did something to offend the gods?
People get sick, Rose.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.280
Not here.

13:10.582 --> 13:13.289
Here they get better.

13:22.552 --> 13:24.713
When was the last time you did this?

13:24.805 --> 13:27.968
An appendectomy
or shaving a man's stomach?

13:31.269 --> 13:35.558
In my residency.
I did a lot of 'em back then.

13:40.112 --> 13:43.149
Then you know the incision
needs to be two inches lower

13:43.240 --> 13:46.403
- than where you're shaving.
- I'm just cleaning the area.

13:46.535 --> 13:48.526
Thank you.

13:53.458 --> 13:57.042
- I want to talk you through it.
- What?

13:57.129 --> 13:59.165
I don't want to be unconscious.

13:59.256 --> 14:02.748
We can use the lidocaine
to numb the area.

14:03.635 --> 14:07.924
And then I can watch the procedure,
help you out.

14:08.015 --> 14:10.882
And how are you gonna watch,

14:10.976 --> 14:14.093
flat on your back with my hand
in your abdominal cavity?

14:14.229 --> 14:17.938
We can use a mirror.
Kate can hold it.

14:21.695 --> 14:25.358
lf someone's going to be in there,
shouldn't it be someone

14:25.449 --> 14:26.859
with medical experience?

14:26.950 --> 14:29.817
- Bernard's a dentist.
- I want it to be Kate.

14:33.957 --> 14:35.288
OK.

14:38.420 --> 14:41.412
Don't worry, Ms. Berenberg.
You're in good hands.

14:41.506 --> 14:44.464
I'll see you tomorrow at 5:00 AM.

14:44.551 --> 14:48.043
- And remember, no solid food, OK?
- Thank you, doctor.

14:51.641 --> 14:52.721
Jack?

14:54.603 --> 14:56.218
Jack?

14:56.313 --> 14:58.304
[phone rings]

14:58.398 --> 15:01.890
Will you take a look at this X-ray?
It's in the L-4.

15:01.985 --> 15:04.067
- Tell me what you think.
- L-4, yeah.

15:04.154 --> 15:06.645
Dr. Shephard, there's a call for you.

15:06.740 --> 15:09.322
It's a Dr. Stillman
from Santa Rosa Hospital,

15:09.409 --> 15:11.400
says it's about a friend of yours.

15:12.579 --> 15:16.037
He's refusing to take his meds
and he's stopped sleeping.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.408
What about his therapy sessions?

15:20.170 --> 15:23.003
Therapy's been rendered useless.

15:24.633 --> 15:26.874
And why is that?

15:26.968 --> 15:29.175
Because he doesn't think I exist.

15:30.097 --> 15:31.712
[door clicks]

15:40.732 --> 15:42.188
Hey, Hurley.

15:43.026 --> 15:44.106
Hey, Jack.

15:53.537 --> 15:55.528
Why aren't you taking your meds?

15:55.622 --> 15:57.783
'Cause we're dead.

15:59.126 --> 16:02.493
All of us. All the Oceanic Six.

16:02.587 --> 16:04.088
We're all dead.

16:05.006 --> 16:08.248
- We never got off that island.
- Hurley.

16:09.052 --> 16:11.088
That is not true.

16:11.888 --> 16:16.598
- What'd you do today?
- What did I do today? I, uh...

16:18.520 --> 16:21.182
I woke up, took a shower.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.897
Uh, Kate and l fed the baby.

16:24.985 --> 16:28.523
I thought you didn't want
anything to do with Aaron?

16:29.406 --> 16:31.738
I changed my mind after the trial.

16:33.118 --> 16:36.610
Living with Kate. Taking care of Aaron.

16:37.873 --> 16:39.454
It all seems so perfect.

16:40.417 --> 16:42.078
Just like heaven.

16:43.753 --> 16:47.666
Just because I'm happy
doesn't mean this isn't real, Hurley.

16:47.757 --> 16:49.793
l was happy too, Jack.

16:51.011 --> 16:52.592
For a while, anyway.

16:55.432 --> 16:56.968
Then I saw Charlie.

17:01.104 --> 17:04.562
He likes to sit with me on the bench
out on the front lawn.

17:05.275 --> 17:07.766
It's pretty cool, actually.

17:11.781 --> 17:14.693
OK. So what do the two of you
talk about?

17:14.784 --> 17:17.821
Well, yesterday he told me
you were gonna be coming by.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.864
He wanted me to give you a message.

17:22.959 --> 17:24.460
A message?

17:28.089 --> 17:31.707
He made me write it down,
so I wouldn't mess it up.

17:35.847 --> 17:38.589
"You're not supposed
to raise him, Jack."

17:40.977 --> 17:43.309
Does that make any sense?

17:44.522 --> 17:47.229
No, that doesn't make any sense.

17:47.317 --> 17:49.649
Do you think he means Aaron?

17:58.370 --> 18:00.406
Take your meds, Hurley.

18:01.248 --> 18:02.579
Just take 'em.

18:03.875 --> 18:05.285
Hey, Jack?

18:07.754 --> 18:10.837
Charlie said someone's
gonna be visiting you, too.

18:13.260 --> 18:14.716
Soon.

18:27.482 --> 18:28.847
We're here.

18:43.206 --> 18:44.742
Hey.

18:44.833 --> 18:47.290
Why don't you let me go first.

18:47.377 --> 18:50.835
You know, make sure everything's safe.

18:51.673 --> 18:53.584
OK.

18:54.134 --> 18:56.750
- Be careful, Dan.
- Absolutely.

19:12.444 --> 19:15.231
Where do you suppose
all this power's coming from?

19:15.322 --> 19:17.153
Add that one to the list, Dan.

19:17.240 --> 19:19.982
Let's just grab the equipment
and go, shall we?

20:07.374 --> 20:09.911
Whoa! You want a hand with the baby?

20:10.001 --> 20:12.913
- No, thanks. I'm fine.
- You sure? I'm good with kids.

20:13.004 --> 20:15.996
What part of "restraining order"
don't you understand?

20:16.091 --> 20:18.298
[rustling]

20:19.135 --> 20:21.512
- [cocks gun]
- Get behind me, Claire.

20:30.980 --> 20:32.561
Whoa! Hey!

20:32.649 --> 20:34.765
- Who the hell are you?
- Lapidus?

20:34.859 --> 20:36.315
Miles?

20:36.403 --> 20:40.146
- You two know each other?
- You gotta hide, man, right now.

20:40.281 --> 20:43.114
- What?
- Keamy's coming back.

20:43.201 --> 20:46.693
If he sees you, he'll kill all of you.
He's close. You gotta hide!

20:46.830 --> 20:48.570
- Go! Hide!
- Come on.

20:48.665 --> 20:50.530
- Just hide!
- Come on, come on.

20:50.625 --> 20:52.035
Let's go.

20:52.127 --> 20:54.459
[voices approaching]

20:57.549 --> 21:00.461
- Where's the chopper?
- About a click back that way.

21:00.552 --> 21:02.918
- Did you bring the kit?
- It's right here.

21:03.012 --> 21:05.344
He looks bad.
What the hell happened?

21:05.473 --> 21:07.805
You do yourjob, I'll do mine.

21:08.518 --> 21:09.633
[Aaron hiccups]

21:18.862 --> 21:21.274
OK, it's getting dark, man.

21:21.364 --> 21:23.275
We gotta leave now.

21:23.366 --> 21:24.867
Mr. Keamy.

21:24.993 --> 21:28.360
We gotta get back to the chopper.
Keamy, we gotta get back.

21:28.455 --> 21:32.039
I am not flying Faraday's bearings
at night. I'm not gonna do it.

21:32.125 --> 21:35.117
If you want to get back,
we gotta leave right now, sir.

21:35.879 --> 21:38.165
Fine. Lead the way.

21:40.300 --> 21:41.585
Come on.

21:44.262 --> 21:46.378
[fading voices]

21:53.521 --> 21:56.479
- Tent's all set. Everything's ready.
- Good. Thanks.

21:56.566 --> 21:59.854
I can use an extra pair of hands
in there. Want to help me out?

22:00.945 --> 22:04.403
- I don't think it's a good idea.
- It's just holding a mirror.

22:04.491 --> 22:07.358
Jack wants to watch the surgery,
talk me through it.

22:08.244 --> 22:09.825
What?

22:09.913 --> 22:13.030
I'm surprised he's not
taking it out himself by now.

22:15.835 --> 22:18.292
Jack. What are you doing?

22:18.379 --> 22:20.756
I don't need a stretcher.
I can walk 50 feet.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.421
I'll help you.

22:22.509 --> 22:25.216
They're gonna be back
with the instruments soon.

22:25.303 --> 22:28.340
We need to be ready to go
as soon as they get back.

22:28.431 --> 22:29.671
See you in there.

22:36.523 --> 22:38.605
It looks like I'm gonna be your nurse.

22:40.610 --> 22:42.601
Wouldn't be the first time.

22:46.991 --> 22:48.401
Listen, um...

22:49.327 --> 22:52.114
- ...if something happens to me...
- Shut up, Jack.

22:54.541 --> 22:55.872
Fair enough.

22:59.295 --> 23:02.128
[distant train horn blowing]

23:20.066 --> 23:21.977
[engine starts]

23:26.781 --> 23:27.987
Kate.

23:29.659 --> 23:30.990
Kate.

23:33.371 --> 23:34.907
Wake up, Kate.

23:37.041 --> 23:38.247
Hey.

23:39.085 --> 23:43.419
- What time is it?
- lt's late. ljust got home.

23:44.591 --> 23:47.082
- Were you working?
- No.

23:48.094 --> 23:51.678
| just had to stop and get something.
I just took awhile.

23:52.640 --> 23:53.846
Hey.

23:54.892 --> 23:57.178
What's going on? What's wrong?

23:58.813 --> 24:00.769
The other night,

24:00.857 --> 24:05.271
when l was reading to Aaron,
you said... that l was a natural.

24:08.281 --> 24:09.942
Do you really...

24:12.201 --> 24:15.113
Do you really think
that I'm good at this?

24:19.292 --> 24:22.580
Yeah. You're good at this.

24:40.396 --> 24:41.977
Will you marry me?

25:08.591 --> 25:09.751
Yes.

25:16.683 --> 25:18.674
Of course lwill. Yes.

25:39.288 --> 25:40.744
Look, they're back.

25:43.543 --> 25:46.831
- Did you find everything?
- Yes, ma'am. Entire list.

25:47.672 --> 25:49.503
- Is he OK?
- For now.

25:49.590 --> 25:53.378
Sun, we need to sterilize these.
There's a pot of water boiling here.

25:54.137 --> 25:56.298
- Charlotte.
- Yeah?

25:59.684 --> 26:00.719
Pardon?

26:11.988 --> 26:14.980
I'm sorry. Perhaps I can
get your wife to translate...

27:19.680 --> 27:23.343
You know, Jack, they found some
chloroform at the medical station.

27:23.434 --> 27:24.719
I could knock you out.

27:24.811 --> 27:27.894
Wouldn't you rather be dreaming
about something nice back home?

27:27.980 --> 27:29.936
No. l'll manage with the lidocaine.

27:32.860 --> 27:34.521
Kate.

27:38.741 --> 27:40.277
Hold it right there.

27:40.868 --> 27:43.905
OK, this is gonna numb the area
of the first incision.

27:43.996 --> 27:46.703
After that, lwould like
to be able to tell you

27:46.791 --> 27:50.375
you're not gonna feel a thing,
but you will.

27:53.798 --> 27:55.163
You ready?

27:59.846 --> 28:02.212
OK. Here we go.

28:07.436 --> 28:09.893
[groaning quietly]

28:14.694 --> 28:16.434
[groans]

28:27.707 --> 28:29.038
OK, Jack, one more.

28:29.125 --> 28:31.582
- [groans loudly]
- Try not to move.

28:33.421 --> 28:35.036
Just stay still.

28:35.131 --> 28:37.167
- Spreader.
- Kate, I can't see it.

28:37.258 --> 28:40.170
- I'm sorry.
- Just stay still. Spreader.

28:40.261 --> 28:42.923
[Jack, groaning] It's good, it's good.

28:46.309 --> 28:47.674
It's good.

28:49.645 --> 28:51.476
[screams]

28:51.564 --> 28:54.146
- Knock him out, Bernard.
- No, no!

28:54.233 --> 28:57.976
- I don't want to be unconscious.
- You don't want to be out of control.

28:58.154 --> 28:59.985
- Kate. No.
- You need to leave.

29:00.072 --> 29:02.563
- Bernard! Kate, you need to go.
- Kate.

29:02.658 --> 29:04.819
Bernard! Kate, get out of here!

29:04.911 --> 29:06.947
- Bernard.
- Jack.

29:07.038 --> 29:08.994
Kate. Kate, get out of here!

29:09.081 --> 29:12.539
- Damn it, Bernard, knock him out!
- I'm sorry, Jack, but I agree.

29:22.887 --> 29:24.468
Laker, Ryan.

29:24.555 --> 29:26.841
Patient is a male, 36.

29:28.309 --> 29:29.515
[beep]

29:29.644 --> 29:32.977
Osteoblastoma is present
in the posterior area of the lumbar.

29:33.064 --> 29:35.851
- I am recommending biopsy for...
- [beep]

29:38.861 --> 29:40.226
[beep]

29:46.327 --> 29:47.737
[louder beep]

29:48.412 --> 29:50.573
[door shuts]

29:51.374 --> 29:53.205
[beeping continues]

30:22.571 --> 30:24.027
[man] Jack?

30:42.508 --> 30:43.793
Jack?

30:54.937 --> 30:56.302
You OK?

30:56.397 --> 30:58.638
Uh, yeah, I'm OK.

31:02.028 --> 31:03.768
| just...

31:04.697 --> 31:08.861
The... The smoke detector was beeping.

31:08.951 --> 31:10.737
And | just...

31:11.954 --> 31:14.195
Thank you for keeping us safe.

31:16.417 --> 31:17.782
Erika? Um...

31:19.420 --> 31:22.127
- You mind doing me a favor?
- Yeah, sure.

31:22.214 --> 31:25.877
Could you write a scrip
for clonazepam?

31:27.261 --> 31:29.092
- For you?
- Yeah.

31:29.889 --> 31:31.754
Just a lot going on right now.

31:32.558 --> 31:35.516
Just a little snowed under
with all my caseload

31:35.603 --> 31:37.139
and Kate and I got engaged.

31:37.980 --> 31:41.438
Just not sleeping very well at night.

31:46.113 --> 31:47.148
Thank you.

31:48.157 --> 31:51.991
Getting engaged is supposed
to help reduce stress, not create it.

31:52.078 --> 31:55.662
Yeah, you're right.

31:56.791 --> 31:58.656
You should talk to someone.

31:59.960 --> 32:01.370
I'll do that.

32:02.213 --> 32:04.420
- Good night.
- Good night.

32:16.393 --> 32:19.806
[Kate] I'll have the nanny stay
for an extra couple of hours.

32:19.897 --> 32:22.058
Jack's never home before 8.00 anyway.

32:24.693 --> 32:26.604
I can stay for at least an hour.

32:29.615 --> 32:31.651
I gotta go. Jack's home.

32:31.742 --> 32:33.403
Yeah, OK. I'll call you later.

32:33.494 --> 32:34.904
Bye.

32:36.455 --> 32:38.036
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:38.124 --> 32:39.830
You scared me.

32:39.917 --> 32:42.408
Sorry. I thought you'd be in bed.

32:43.379 --> 32:45.040
Who was that?

32:45.131 --> 32:46.621
That was Noreen.

32:47.967 --> 32:49.423
Noreen?

32:49.510 --> 32:52.172
Yeah. She's one of the moms
from the park.

32:56.600 --> 32:58.761
- What?
- Nothing.

33:00.229 --> 33:03.562
- Never heard you mention her before.
- Well, now you have.

33:07.486 --> 33:09.101
I'll see you upstairs.

33:58.621 --> 34:01.112
[light snoring]

34:08.589 --> 34:11.126
[gasps]

34:19.642 --> 34:21.303
Dad?

34:30.486 --> 34:31.646
Hey.

34:33.155 --> 34:36.363
Don't worry. It went well.

34:37.701 --> 34:39.441
She did good.

34:41.163 --> 34:43.950
She said you can go back inside
if you want to.

34:45.334 --> 34:47.325
- Thank you.
- OK.

35:04.103 --> 35:06.515
He didn't lose that much blood.

35:06.605 --> 35:09.267
I got the appendix out
and put everything back

35:09.358 --> 35:11.098
where it belongs, I think.

35:12.987 --> 35:16.320
- So he's gonna be OK?
- He should be fine.

35:16.407 --> 35:20.446
- We just have to talk him into resting.
- Good luck with that.

35:22.413 --> 35:24.028
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

35:24.123 --> 35:27.707
Don't worry about it.
You had enough going on.

35:34.049 --> 35:35.380
You know, he kissed me.

35:36.510 --> 35:39.252
- What?
- The other day,

35:39.346 --> 35:43.134
when you came back from the other side
of the island, Jack kissed me.

35:44.727 --> 35:45.842
Oh.

35:46.729 --> 35:48.139
It was nice.

35:49.857 --> 35:52.974
But it wasn't for me, it was for him.

35:53.068 --> 35:55.935
I'm pretty sure he was trying
to prove something.

36:02.077 --> 36:04.068
That he doesn't love someone else.

36:14.506 --> 36:16.167
Thank you, Juliet.

36:20.429 --> 36:22.385
Thank you for saving his life.

36:35.319 --> 36:36.855
I know you're awake.

36:50.125 --> 36:51.456
Hey.

36:54.380 --> 36:55.665
Hey.

36:57.007 --> 36:59.464
You're home early.
Where's Veronica?

36:59.551 --> 37:01.382
I sent her home.

37:02.221 --> 37:03.381
The baby's asleep.

37:05.140 --> 37:06.596
Good.

37:09.561 --> 37:11.222
Why was she here?

37:15.359 --> 37:16.690
Sorry?

37:18.570 --> 37:19.980
The nanny.

37:20.072 --> 37:22.734
She only works 'til 4.00.

37:22.825 --> 37:24.816
I came home at 6.00.

37:24.910 --> 37:27.242
I had to run some errands,

37:27.329 --> 37:30.241
so I asked her to stay
a couple extra hours.

37:34.044 --> 37:36.535
What's going on, Jack?

37:39.967 --> 37:41.673
Why are you home so early?

37:43.095 --> 37:44.926
I went to see Hurley.

37:46.849 --> 37:50.182
- Today?
- Last Friday.

37:51.478 --> 37:54.185
Why didn't you tell me?
I would've gone with you.

37:57.609 --> 37:59.645
Because he's crazy, Kate,

37:59.736 --> 38:01.863
and I didn't want to upset you.

38:07.619 --> 38:09.120
Where were you today?

38:18.630 --> 38:22.293
I'm gonna ask you to trust me.

38:23.886 --> 38:25.797
Trust me and just leave it be.

38:33.395 --> 38:34.726
Where were you?

38:40.235 --> 38:43.068
- Jack, don't.
- I heard you on the phone last night.

38:43.989 --> 38:45.980
Who were you talking to?

38:47.451 --> 38:50.864
- Just let it go.
- No, no, lwant to know.

38:50.954 --> 38:52.330
No, Jack.

38:52.414 --> 38:54.370
I want to know where you were and...

38:54.458 --> 38:56.915
- It doesn't matter, Jack.
- Tell me. Tell me!

39:01.590 --> 39:03.922
l was doing something for him.

39:05.135 --> 39:06.250
For who?

39:08.055 --> 39:09.795
For Sawyer.

39:13.936 --> 39:15.892
I made him a promise.

39:22.152 --> 39:24.188
- What?
- It doesn't matter.

39:24.279 --> 39:27.612
- It has nothing to do with us.
- Then why won't you tell me?

39:27.699 --> 39:30.782
Because he wouldn't want me to.

39:31.578 --> 39:34.615
But he's not here, is he? No.

39:34.706 --> 39:38.619
No, he made his choice.
He chose to stay.

39:40.462 --> 39:41.963
I'm the one who came back.

39:43.715 --> 39:48.425
I'm the one who's here,
I'm the one who saved you.

39:52.182 --> 39:53.592
Jack.

39:55.602 --> 39:58.218
You can't... You can't do this.

39:58.313 --> 40:00.975
If you have problems,
you need to figure them out.

40:01.149 --> 40:03.856
I can't have you like this
around my son.

40:05.195 --> 40:06.810
Your son?

40:06.905 --> 40:09.897
You're not even related to him.

40:12.077 --> 40:13.908
[creaking]

40:19.418 --> 40:22.410
Hey, sweetpea. Hey.

40:53.368 --> 40:54.983
- [groans]
- Morning.

40:55.704 --> 40:57.865
lt's way too early for Chinese.

41:01.126 --> 41:04.618
Where's Claire? The ladies' room?

41:04.713 --> 41:06.374
Nope.

41:07.049 --> 41:09.381
She just walked off into the jungle.

41:11.136 --> 41:12.467
What?

41:13.597 --> 41:15.804
- When?
- In the middle of the night,

41:15.891 --> 41:18.598
- just got up and left.
- And you let her go alone?

41:18.685 --> 41:21.722
- She wasn't alone.
- Well, who was she with?

41:22.939 --> 41:24.725
She called him "Dad."

41:24.816 --> 41:28.604
I would've followed them,
but I have a restraining order.

41:32.866 --> 41:35.107
[Aaron crying]

41:36.078 --> 41:37.568
Claire!

41:37.663 --> 41:39.324
Claire!

41:39.998 --> 41:43.206
[Aaron continues crying]

41:57.182 --> 41:59.639
It's OK, it's OK.

41:59.726 --> 42:01.387
I got you.

42:05.774 --> 42:07.059
Claire!

42:12.280 --> 42:13.611
Claire!

42:13.740 --> 42:15.981
[Aaron continues crying]

42:17.994 --> 42:19.450
Claire!

42:21.373 --> 42:22.783
Claire!
