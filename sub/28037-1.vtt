12:15.386 --> 12:17.084
when I was little so I always

12:18.607 --> 12:20.217
...dreamed about picking up
and going with someone.

12:20.740 --> 12:21.566
Nice.

12:22.393 --> 12:24.004
Well I think you'll have fun.

12:24.482 --> 12:25.483
Yeah.

12:26.484 --> 12:28.051
I'd love to get out of here.

12:28.748 --> 12:29.487
Yeah you and me both.

12:33.056 --> 12:34.318
-Can I get you something?

12:37.452 --> 12:38.322
Miss?

12:38.366 --> 12:39.802
Can I have the check please?

12:41.499 --> 12:42.283
Okay.

13:01.911 --> 13:02.433
Hi honey.

13:03.173 --> 13:04.914
About damn time!

13:05.610 --> 13:07.177
Fucking where were you?

13:07.221 --> 13:09.179
-I was at the salon. Where
were you, here?

13:09.789 --> 13:10.093
Yes!

13:11.225 --> 13:12.008
Y-You gotta answer your phone,
okay?

13:12.879 --> 13:13.096
I'm sorry, I left it here.

13:14.184 --> 13:15.490
I-I'm in deep shit, okay?

13:16.926 --> 13:18.362
-yeah what does that mean
"I'm in deep shit?"

13:18.406 --> 13:21.017
It means that I owe Vincent
a lot of fucking money,

13:21.061 --> 13:23.759
and if I don't get it to him
he's going to kill me.

13:23.803 --> 13:24.978
Literally slit my throat.

13:25.021 --> 13:26.501
Innards everywhere!
-Okay, okay!!

13:26.544 --> 13:27.981
So measure that
-Okay! Just..

13:28.024 --> 13:29.852
into your lifes equation. So...

13:29.896 --> 13:34.030
Let's just take a breath,
and, and...um...

13:35.205 --> 13:35.945
What do you, what do you
propose that we do?

13:35.989 --> 13:37.468
I don't fucking know!

13:37.512 --> 13:39.993
I asked Ken for money but he's
a coke-head douche bag

13:40.036 --> 13:41.037
so he wouldn't give me any.

13:41.081 --> 13:42.647
Um, I asked uh...

13:42.691 --> 13:45.912
Stefan for a loan but he's still
pissed a-about the mule job

13:45.955 --> 13:47.261
that I fucked up which,

13:47.304 --> 13:49.437
how the FUCK was I supposed
to know that that

13:49.480 --> 13:52.962
dirty fucking JAP was a
GOD DAMNED RAT!?

13:54.094 --> 13:54.877
...Um

13:56.226 --> 13:57.662
- Okay well then, um, I could
take some more

13:57.706 --> 13:59.273
uh, shifts at the salon?

13:59.316 --> 14:01.753
No baby, that won't work.
We need money now!

14:02.493 --> 14:04.234
[PHONE RINGS]

14:07.194 --> 14:08.891
[PHONE RINGS]

14:09.718 --> 14:10.980
Are you gonna fucking get that?

14:11.024 --> 14:12.503
Let's, let's handle
one thing at a time

14:12.547 --> 14:14.114
-let's just let it go
to voicemail

14:14.157 --> 14:15.332
-I'll deal with
it in a second.

14:16.507 --> 14:17.726
[Voicemail]:
Hello, Tiffany?

14:17.769 --> 14:19.467
this is Marty,
uh, Mr. Maguffin.

14:19.510 --> 14:21.948
I know you've done a lot
for us and...

14:21.991 --> 14:24.951
I'd love to thank
you by taking you
for some dinner?

14:24.994 --> 14:27.127
Jamie loves you and I feel
I should do this

14:27.170 --> 14:30.304
so if you could call me at my
cell it'd be great.

14:31.044 --> 14:32.262
Yeah I'm sure.

14:33.481 --> 14:33.960
Hope to hear
from you soon!

14:34.656 --> 14:35.265
The fuck was that?

14:36.527 --> 14:38.138
That's that um, that dad of that
girl I babysit

14:38.181 --> 14:39.139
like three times a week.

14:40.488 --> 14:41.271
That rich little brat?

14:41.315 --> 14:42.316
-Yeah.

14:44.709 --> 14:46.668
He's so fucking weird, man

14:46.711 --> 14:50.672
he keeps on like, like trying
to get with me and

14:50.715 --> 14:53.022
he does't seem to understand
that I'm like

14:53.066 --> 14:55.982
way too young for him like,
like twenty years too young

14:56.025 --> 14:56.983
and I'm already dating-

14:58.071 --> 14:58.810
THAT'S IT!
-oh my god!

14:58.854 --> 14:58.985
That's fucking it!

14:59.507 --> 15:00.421
Seduce him.

15:01.552 --> 15:02.249
..What?

15:02.292 --> 15:04.773
N-n-no! Seduce him

15:04.816 --> 15:06.688
and then ask him for money,

15:06.731 --> 15:09.169
and he'll give it to you and
then we'll be free and clear

15:09.212 --> 15:10.257
I'm a fucking genuis!
-stop, STOP!

15:11.736 --> 15:13.216
I'm not going to go fuck some
other dude for money.

15:13.260 --> 15:14.391
I'm not going to go
fuck some other dude for
money. -No, shh!

15:14.435 --> 15:15.088
No I'm not saying fuck him.
God!

15:15.740 --> 15:16.959
Just, just seduce him

15:17.003 --> 15:18.700
and ask him for money,
it's that simple.

15:18.743 --> 15:20.441
Stop, no, I'm not gonna do that.

15:21.659 --> 15:23.139
You need to do this.
It's, it's gotta work.

15:23.183 --> 15:25.707
Okay? Baby? Please?
You owe me.

15:27.013 --> 15:28.623
Thats! -Whenever you left
home I took you in.

15:30.016 --> 15:31.626
Um, um that time that I fucking
bailed you out because

15:31.669 --> 15:33.410
your clepto-ass couldn't stop-
- Okay, okay, okay!

15:34.063 --> 15:35.108
I fucking..I, I get it.

15:35.151 --> 15:37.153
- I get it just, just shut up.

15:39.242 --> 15:40.635
C'mon baby please, okay?

15:40.678 --> 15:41.679
I love you.

15:42.550 --> 15:44.639
I love you and...

15:45.292 --> 15:46.946
I don't want to die.

15:47.468 --> 15:48.208
-so...

15:49.122 --> 15:50.427
..please baby?

15:53.213 --> 15:55.171
-I think I'm
being watched

15:55.215 --> 15:56.129
-Yeah by who?

15:56.912 --> 15:57.957
Cops?

16:01.786 --> 16:03.440
Put him down.

16:06.052 --> 16:09.011
Now explain to us how you
being watched by the cops.

16:15.452 --> 16:18.803
This morning, when I was at
the coffee house

16:20.109 --> 16:22.155
I-I peeked outside and I-I
saw a cop car

16:22.198 --> 16:23.634
just parked there, you know.

16:24.287 --> 16:25.375
J-just sitting there-

16:27.029 --> 16:28.988
Stop fuckin' mumbling and
get to the point.

16:29.858 --> 16:30.728
How you know it was a cop?

16:32.208 --> 16:33.775
T-the guy's a regular you know?

16:33.818 --> 16:35.907
He's been driving the same car
for two or three years.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.042
I thought maybe he was
just on the phone or somethin'

16:40.086 --> 16:41.957
but I saw him again on
my lunch break.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.263
only this time

16:44.742 --> 16:45.613
He was in an unmarked car
with two other guys.

16:46.831 --> 16:48.094
when I got home

16:49.051 --> 16:49.486
I recieved a call

16:51.010 --> 16:53.751
One of the young waitresses
said a detective came in

16:53.795 --> 16:56.493
and started asking questions
about the management.

16:59.801 --> 17:01.411
I-I hung up immediately when
I heard this! I-I

17:01.455 --> 17:02.543
I didn't know if I was
bugged or-

17:03.152 --> 17:03.413
You're coming with us.

17:09.028 --> 17:09.723
No..

17:11.117 --> 17:12.031
No.

17:15.077 --> 17:17.339
-No, no, no,

17:17.384 --> 17:18.340
NO!

17:23.520 --> 17:26.609
You stupid, slimey fuck.

17:28.395 --> 17:31.093
-You know I oughta rip
your fucking heart out.

17:33.139 --> 17:34.053
Motherfucker.

17:35.141 --> 17:37.056
How could you let this happen?

17:38.622 --> 17:39.754
You know I oughta just-

17:39.797 --> 17:42.061
Hey, hey! Just relax,
he's nervous.

17:43.497 --> 17:44.759
There's nothing wrong we still
have our connections.

17:45.977 --> 17:47.457
Now I can figure this out.

17:48.632 --> 17:49.459
-I don't think
it's that simple.

17:50.895 --> 17:53.159
I just got this, this morning.

17:53.202 --> 17:55.813
I think you have yourself
a rodent problem Vincent,

17:55.857 --> 17:57.293
Quite possibly a large one.

17:58.251 --> 17:58.990
The fuck is this?

17:59.817 --> 18:00.905
Evidence.

18:02.255 --> 18:03.647
Apparently someone's been
sticking their nose

18:03.691 --> 18:05.562
in your business and they've
given a wiff to the dogs.

18:06.389 --> 18:06.737
-Who gave you this?

18:08.391 --> 18:09.914
Luckily Vincent still has well
placed spiders who catch these

18:09.958 --> 18:11.394
things in their little webs.

18:12.178 --> 18:13.048
-Is this?

18:13.092 --> 18:14.963
Enough to arrest him? No.

18:16.182 --> 18:17.618
It is enough to push for a
search warrant though.

18:19.228 --> 18:20.403
Do we have anything here or at
the coffee house that they-

18:20.447 --> 18:21.143
There's some books and other
shit. BONES!

18:24.103 --> 18:26.192
Go there, clean house, make sure
you leave nothing for the

18:26.235 --> 18:27.410
fuckin' feds to find.

18:28.194 --> 18:29.151
Right away, sir.

18:29.195 --> 18:30.805
Hey! Tell Ray to do the
same here.

18:30.848 --> 18:31.806
Yes, sir.

18:33.068 --> 18:34.330
I may have something

18:34.374 --> 18:36.158
These emails were sent from
someone's phone.

18:37.333 --> 18:39.205
Whoever sent them missed
making it anonymous.

18:39.727 --> 18:40.206
-Really?

18:43.165 --> 18:43.818
So.

18:44.558 --> 18:46.037
Who's number is this?

18:46.995 --> 18:47.691
I don't-

18:47.735 --> 18:48.605
Who's fucking number-

18:48.649 --> 18:49.737
Just relax, I'll handle this.

18:50.999 --> 18:52.740
Do you know who's number
this is?

18:54.698 --> 18:56.222
Wait, let me check my phone.

19:03.533 --> 19:04.447
-Shit..

19:05.231 --> 19:06.188
Who?

19:06.232 --> 19:07.581
Tell us you fucking shit!

19:08.408 --> 19:08.973
-I-It's Primo's boy.

19:09.017 --> 19:09.931
WHO!?

19:10.236 --> 19:10.932
Sal!

19:11.759 --> 19:13.152
Who the fuck is Sal!?

19:13.195 --> 19:14.588
- Calm down or we'll never
figure it out.

19:17.373 --> 19:19.506
Are you talking about the guy
they found dead in November?

19:20.898 --> 19:21.595
Okay.

19:22.770 --> 19:25.076
You're telling me it's
that man's son?

19:25.120 --> 19:26.121
-Yeah.

19:27.340 --> 19:29.255
He's only worked for me since
December.

19:29.298 --> 19:32.040
I-I don't know. I just
wanted to help him.

19:33.128 --> 19:33.911
So what the fuck is he doing?

19:35.696 --> 19:37.480
He must blame you Vincent.

19:39.265 --> 19:39.830
What?

19:40.614 --> 19:40.788
-That makes sense.

19:42.006 --> 19:42.268
How the fuck does
that make sense?

19:43.834 --> 19:45.575
The shooting, down at the docks.
Crazy Cameron thought we had

19:45.619 --> 19:47.098
the feds there that night.

19:49.231 --> 19:50.885
I remember Primo's funeral.

19:52.278 --> 19:54.584
That kid had a look in his eye,
just like you do now.

19:54.628 --> 19:56.325
- So Vincent,what I think we
should do is-

19:56.369 --> 19:58.458
Fuck it, kid. Paulie you know
what

19:58.501 --> 20:01.200
you started this fuckin' shit.
Fix it.

20:05.291 --> 20:08.903
SCRAM! GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE
WHILE YOU CAN STILL FUCKING WALK

20:09.773 --> 20:10.339
-Vin.

20:12.080 --> 20:12.863
-Vin

20:12.907 --> 20:13.908
Fuck me.

20:14.387 --> 20:15.605
Look, Vin-

20:15.649 --> 20:17.694
All of you fuck OFF!
Get the fuck outta here!

20:29.706 --> 20:33.971
-A word?

20:46.157 --> 20:49.291
-Which speaking of
money, I'm going
to need some more.

20:49.335 --> 20:50.292
How much?

20:51.467 --> 20:52.816
Hundred thousand should clean up
this mess.

20:54.688 --> 20:55.993
Do you know who made you?
-Yes..

20:56.037 --> 20:57.865
and I would like to keep
it that way.

20:58.518 --> 20:59.214
Hundred thousand.

20:59.823 --> 21:00.215
Done.

21:00.955 --> 21:01.216
I may need more.

21:02.043 --> 21:03.349
Fine, what the fuck ever.

21:04.219 --> 21:05.264
Let me take you home, sir.

21:06.090 --> 21:07.091
We'll figure this out later.

21:09.050 --> 21:11.139
But I am in the middle-
-Come by tomorrow.

21:11.966 --> 21:13.272
Do not leave me out in the cold.

21:14.098 --> 21:14.447
I won't.

21:17.580 --> 21:19.408
Don't forget about the fucking
Mexican deal.

21:19.452 --> 21:20.496
- I'm already on it.

21:28.374 --> 21:30.071
♪

21:40.211 --> 21:41.952
-I don't know what Maurice
could have told you.

21:43.519 --> 21:45.521
I mean isn't that something
we do?

21:47.610 --> 21:48.611
Uh huh.

21:51.092 --> 21:52.398
Yeah check with him on that.

21:53.137 --> 21:53.529
I gotta go.

21:55.575 --> 21:58.708
- You seemed a little anxious
in there.

21:58.752 --> 22:01.232
I was beginning to think maybe
you were too busy.

22:02.146 --> 22:02.669
I'm never anxious.

22:03.365 --> 22:04.235
Look.

22:05.802 --> 22:07.282
They haven't shaken since
Vincent gave me his first job.

22:08.109 --> 22:09.893
Alright Mister no shakes.

22:16.117 --> 22:17.118
-What about you?

22:18.119 --> 22:19.338
Why were you so serious
back there?

22:20.295 --> 22:22.471
I take my business very
seriously.

22:24.212 --> 22:27.607
Oh I have not behaved like this
since like high school.

22:29.217 --> 22:30.261
Were you one of those future
business leaders of America?

22:30.305 --> 22:32.394
No, I was a lazy lazy smart kid.

22:33.090 --> 22:33.352
So a cheerleader?

22:34.483 --> 22:36.050
Captain of the
cheerleading squad.

22:36.398 --> 22:37.356
Oh yeah?

22:37.399 --> 22:38.357
Yeah.

22:42.230 --> 22:45.146
Hey, hey, hey, playtime is over
I have to get back to work.

22:48.628 --> 22:52.327
So, who were you?
Were you the nerd or the jock?

22:52.371 --> 22:53.894
Neither.

22:53.937 --> 22:56.287
I actually did my school work
and then I went to work.

22:59.160 --> 23:01.423
See it was only my mother and I
at that point

23:01.467 --> 23:03.033
and she wasn't making rent.

23:05.949 --> 23:06.863
Well that's no fun.

23:11.694 --> 23:12.652
You're tellin' me.

23:16.046 --> 23:17.178

you do.

36:04.640 --> 36:06.990
I just...ya know. Help him out.

36:07.034 --> 36:10.342
Get him places, make sure work
is serving him well.

Ya know, keep things
in order for him.

36:13.823 --> 36:16.522
That's good. Somebody probably
should be doing that.

36:19.002 --> 36:20.743
You know how much you mean
to him right?

36:22.702 --> 36:24.312
Yeah. I do.

36:24.356 --> 36:28.186
It's not easy with my parents
disowning him and everything.

36:29.230 --> 36:32.494

and sing Kumbaya but

36:32.538 --> 36:34.757

that way now does it.

be able to unfuck us. So...

40:10.799 --> 40:12.845
I mean I-I think so.

40:12.888 --> 40:15.804
It's really, it's really
complicated

40:16.457 --> 40:18.981
So his wife...

40:19.765 --> 40:21.506
Okay, let me just start over.

40:22.550 --> 40:25.248
His wife has these like
family jewels,

40:25.292 --> 40:28.948
and she's, she's been holding
onto them for a few years.

40:28.991 --> 40:31.472
She inherited from like her
grandparents or her

40:31.516 --> 40:33.256
great grandparents,
I don't know.

40:33.300 --> 40:38.218
But she spent like three fourths
of it on like clothers and

40:38.261 --> 40:41.134
jewelry and a bunch of stuff.
And now that she's got like

40:41.177 --> 40:43.441
this little portion left, she
doesn't want to get rid of it

40:43.484 --> 40:45.443
because it's got like
sentimental value.

40:45.486 --> 40:48.054
So she keeps it in this safe
that they have somewhere

40:48.097 --> 40:49.098
in their house.

40:50.622 --> 40:52.624
Wait, so you're gonna have
to steal the family jewels?

40:54.190 --> 40:56.715

wants to do.

40:58.630 --> 40:59.631

about it but I mean w-what

I don't know how to break into

41:16.604 --> 41:18.345

Shit I told him that night come
work for me.

52:50.993 --> 52:53.996
He wanted more than a job type
fucking job.

52:55.476 --> 52:57.870
So we kept in touch through
the years.

52:57.913 --> 53:00.133
He went on and got his M.B.A.

53:00.177 --> 53:02.179
He's fuckin' genius.

53:02.962 --> 53:03.702
Prodigy.

53:05.182 --> 53:07.662
Wasn't long till I realized
what he was made for.

53:08.446 --> 53:10.491
- and what's that, sir?

53:11.188 --> 53:12.885

My old driver, the dead one.

53:19.196 --> 53:21.763
brought me there to
his graduation.

53:21.807 --> 53:25.245
So he was doing all this fucking
song and dance, you know,

53:25.289 --> 53:28.248
graduation ceremonies. It took
him a while to make his way

53:28.292 --> 53:29.423
over to my car.

53:30.990 --> 53:35.212
I let him in, he handed me
his diploma without a word.

53:36.822 --> 53:38.737
I still got that motherfucker.

53:39.651 --> 53:41.218

like me.

53:43.350 --> 53:44.351

53:49.313 --> 53:52.533
It's why I brought him into
this business, to inherit it.

proud.

shaping up for a change.

ask you something.

either put up or shut up.

fuck up. Simple.

what I asked?

isn't the choice
you make.
