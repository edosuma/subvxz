WEBVTT

00:00.375 --> 00:02.007
Who killed my husband?

00:03.903 --> 00:06.910
I promised to give you answers
as we found them.

00:06.911 --> 00:09.846
So you still don't know?

00:09.847 --> 00:11.910
This royal commission of yours

00:11.911 --> 00:15.846
is set up to protect us
from gun violence

00:15.847 --> 00:18.826
and you're going to send
my youngest boy

00:18.827 --> 00:20.886
to face the bullets of ISIS?

00:20.887 --> 00:22.766
Shame on you, Miss King!

00:23.071 --> 00:25.570
"Tell her about Filipetti."

00:25.938 --> 00:28.965
Advising on ways
to avoid criminal charges...

00:28.966 --> 00:33.485
That is perverting
the course of justice, Miss King.

00:33.608 --> 00:35.587
Did you know
about the corruption commission?

00:35.588 --> 00:37.412
Obviously, Lincoln's behind it.

00:37.437 --> 00:39.315
It's not too late to pull out.

00:39.316 --> 00:42.279
Your safety is paramount.
Hey.

00:42.280 --> 00:45.324
Great things
never came from comfort zones.

00:45.325 --> 00:48.288
That gun was used
in two other crimes -

00:48.289 --> 00:52.304
the kneecapping of Felix Murphy
and the murder of Ashleigh Larsson.

00:52.305 --> 00:54.336
We need to find a way
to get to someone

00:54.337 --> 00:56.344
who knows who brought in
that first lot of guns

00:56.345 --> 00:59.356
and if no-one's picking up
the container, that someone is Felix.

00:59.357 --> 01:02.292
Whoever you owed money to paid him.
And that person?

01:02.293 --> 01:04.292
He's up to his eyeballs
in the drive-bys,

01:04.293 --> 01:05.345
the kneecappings, the murders.

01:05.346 --> 01:07.308
Who lent you the money?

01:07.309 --> 01:09.364
And I'm investing
in resources and infrastructure

01:09.365 --> 01:11.352
for the community
that gave me a start.

01:11.353 --> 01:14.530
You do exactly the same, Patrick,
unless you're outbid.

01:14.531 --> 01:18.531
I don't create a mass of gambling
addicts to fund a personal edifice.

01:18.556 --> 01:22.312
It's a leisure centre!
Bullshit! It's halfway to a casino!

01:22.313 --> 01:24.296
So who's really behind this?

01:24.297 --> 01:26.364
I guess we'll find out
when someone comes to collect it.

01:26.365 --> 01:29.324
This was the last guy
Simon hooked up with.

01:29.325 --> 01:32.285
After this, he deleted the app.

01:33.317 --> 01:35.292
Robbie Carter?

01:35.293 --> 01:36.999
How's that for a coincidence?

01:37.024 --> 01:40.972
That's not a coincidence.
It can't be.

01:42.000 --> 01:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:07.301 --> 02:09.340
Mr Carter,
do you know why you're here today?

02:09.341 --> 02:12.356
My wife's close to death because
some drug dealer rammed her car

02:12.357 --> 02:15.312
and what's Janet King do -
she sends me a summons.

02:15.313 --> 02:17.364
Who are the criminals here?
It's not my wife, it's not me.

02:17.365 --> 02:19.324
How is your wife, Mr Carter?

02:19.325 --> 02:20.443
She's deteriorating

02:20.444 --> 02:23.439
and if she dies alone in hospital
while I'm caught up in this circus

02:23.440 --> 02:25.344
I'm gonna be so pissed off.

02:25.345 --> 02:27.336
What do we think?

02:27.337 --> 02:30.320
Maybe he knew Todd
was using Simon's credit card,

02:30.321 --> 02:32.304
figured he'd dumped him
for a younger man.

02:32.305 --> 02:33.348
Simple old-fashioned jealousy?

02:33.349 --> 02:36.316
Just got to catch him in a lie,
take it from there.

02:36.317 --> 02:39.965
Mr Carter, have you ever
been in possession of a firearm?

02:40.325 --> 02:42.372
Firearm?
A gun.

02:42.373 --> 02:44.372
What sort of gun?
Any gun.

02:44.373 --> 02:47.668
A gun that shoots bullets
and can injure or kill someone.

02:47.693 --> 02:49.649
Have you ever had one?

02:50.357 --> 02:53.312
I'm not looking for an essay
on string theory here.

02:53.313 --> 02:55.329
It's a straightforward question.

02:55.329 --> 02:57.293
Yes or no, Mr Carter?

02:58.357 --> 03:01.288
Yeah.
What sort?

03:01.289 --> 03:04.308
It's, um... Actually, it's plastic.

03:04.309 --> 03:06.296
What, like a water pistol?

03:06.297 --> 03:08.309
No, it's 3D.

03:09.309 --> 03:11.300
You mean 3D printed?
Mm.

03:11.301 --> 03:13.360
And did you print this gun yourself?
I got it from a friend.

03:13.361 --> 03:16.332
Whose name is...?

03:16.333 --> 03:18.332
I can't remember exactly.

03:18.333 --> 03:21.628
It wasn't a close friend.
He was more a mate of a mate...

03:21.629 --> 03:25.159
Let me take a stab in the dark
and see if I can help you out.

03:25.184 --> 03:27.832
Was it Simon Hamilton?

03:28.313 --> 03:30.329
You do know Major Simon Hamilton?

03:31.345 --> 03:34.365
A bit.
Why did he give you a plastic gun?

03:36.349 --> 03:38.349
I think, um...

03:39.349 --> 03:41.304
..there's no real reason.

03:41.305 --> 03:44.300
He was just talking about it,
they weren't any good for the army,

03:44.301 --> 03:46.320
I was curious, so he said,
"Here you go. Have it."

03:46.321 --> 03:48.368
Right. Where is it now?
It's at home in the bedroom.

03:48.369 --> 03:51.324
Where exactly?
The top shelf of the wardrobe.

03:51.325 --> 03:53.280
Right.

03:53.281 --> 03:56.811
How would you describe your
relationship with Major Hamilton?

03:58.285 --> 04:00.348
Casual.
Really?

04:00.349 --> 04:02.369
How did you meet?
I forget.

04:02.369 --> 04:05.301
Well, let me see
if I can help you out again.

04:06.325 --> 04:07.372
That's a photograph of you

04:07.373 --> 04:10.373
on a dating app deleted
from Simon Hamilton's phone.

04:10.398 --> 04:12.324
That is how you met.

04:12.325 --> 04:15.340
Yeah, OK. So what the hell has
this got to do with firearm crime?

04:15.341 --> 04:19.320
Do you think you can just trawl
through everyone's private life?

04:19.321 --> 04:21.851
So you're sure
your relationship was casual?

04:21.875 --> 04:23.292
Yeah, it was casual.

04:23.293 --> 04:25.646
Yeah, it was physical,
but it was casual!

04:25.671 --> 04:28.280
Jeez, what is this?
Is this fuckin' 1970?

04:28.281 --> 04:30.352
Did you shoot Todd Wilson
on the 26th of January?

04:30.353 --> 04:32.353
No. I don't even know who that is.

04:32.378 --> 04:34.308
OK. If not, where were you?

04:34.309 --> 04:36.486
On the evening
of the 26th of January,

04:36.511 --> 04:40.217
before you found out about your
wife's accident, where were you?

04:41.353 --> 04:43.357
I was with Simon.

04:45.357 --> 04:47.337
Thank you, Mr Carter.

04:48.337 --> 04:50.325
Do we believe him?

04:50.325 --> 04:53.303
Could explain why
Hamilton's security system was off.

04:53.304 --> 04:54.775
Or if he knew it was off,

04:54.776 --> 04:58.306
he knows it's an alibi we
can't disprove for Todd's shooting.

04:58.331 --> 04:59.280
Convenient.

04:59.281 --> 05:01.300
Searching Robbie's house.
No sign of a weapon yet.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.348
Certainly not in his wardrobe.

05:02.349 --> 05:05.344
So he took it, used it and now
he's scrambling for a cover story.

05:05.345 --> 05:08.581
And remember, Simon's number
was in Brett Bonar's phone.

05:08.606 --> 05:10.304
As was Bao Long's -

05:10.305 --> 05:12.352
the man we now know
loaned Felix Murphy 80 grand.

05:12.353 --> 05:15.324
So... what? We think Bao
ordered Brett to shoot Felix?

05:15.325 --> 05:18.308
Probably, but that doesn't mean
he's behind the importation.

05:18.309 --> 05:20.372
Or knows who else used that gun.
They probably all are.

05:20.373 --> 05:23.292
I think there's something big here.

05:23.293 --> 05:27.058
I can smell it. And we've got
something to use against Simon now.

05:27.083 --> 05:29.083
You going to take that or...?

05:30.369 --> 05:33.280
See if the major can come in
this afternoon.

05:33.281 --> 05:35.105
I'll be back in an hour or two.

05:36.325 --> 05:38.324
It's quite simple, really.

05:38.325 --> 05:40.364
Our State Corruption Commission
is about to tell you

05:40.365 --> 05:43.348
that Wednesday next week
is the public hearing

05:43.349 --> 05:46.281
into your alleged misconduct.

05:47.285 --> 05:51.285
I felt the least I could do was give
you the courtesy of forewarning.

05:51.310 --> 05:52.352
Sporting gesture.

05:52.353 --> 05:55.328
Respect for the condemned,
one might say.

05:55.329 --> 05:57.308
Not that
you're predicting the outcome.

05:57.309 --> 05:59.348
The actual findings
don't really matter.

05:59.349 --> 06:02.308
The inevitable outcome,
regardless of the findings,

06:02.309 --> 06:03.373
being that by the end of the hearing

06:03.373 --> 06:05.360
your reputation
will be torn to pieces.

06:05.361 --> 06:09.279
I hope you'll offer me a drink
if you invited me just to say that.

06:09.280 --> 06:11.457
Let's just cut to the chase,
shall we?

06:12.325 --> 06:16.320
The SCC's charter
is to investigate public figures.

06:16.321 --> 06:19.356
Now, if you were no longer
a public figure -

06:19.357 --> 06:22.352
say, if you were to resign
as royal commissioner,

06:22.353 --> 06:26.341
retire from the bar - then I could
instruct the SCC not to proceed.

06:27.341 --> 06:29.340
I just felt it was only fair

06:29.341 --> 06:32.328
to give you enough time
to consider your position.

06:32.329 --> 06:34.332
Generous to a fault.

06:34.333 --> 06:36.569
That's my middle name -
Generosity.

06:36.594 --> 06:40.288
What did you want, Lincoln?
Did you ever want me to succeed?

06:40.289 --> 06:42.284
My agenda is what benefits me

06:42.285 --> 06:43.373
and is what's best
for the Government.

06:43.373 --> 06:48.292
Quick success by you would
have achieved both those goals.

06:48.293 --> 06:49.344
You know, in the beginning,

06:49.345 --> 06:52.360
I really hoped you would find
who was behind all this nonsense.

06:52.361 --> 06:55.479
But the longer you went on
without any success at all,

06:55.480 --> 06:57.833
the more my agenda
could only be achieved

06:57.858 --> 07:00.356
by giving the public your head.

07:00.357 --> 07:02.368
That's the simple truth.

07:02.369 --> 07:05.280
So really I have two choices -

07:05.281 --> 07:07.280
I either resign from public life

07:07.281 --> 07:11.304
or produce a sudden success
so you can claim a glorious victory.

07:11.305 --> 07:14.364
Well, technically, yes,
although I'm assuming

07:14.365 --> 07:18.280
the second option is completely
unrealistic at this point

07:18.281 --> 07:22.332
and certainly beyond your power
to control it anyway.

07:22.333 --> 07:24.364
So that only leaves...

07:24.365 --> 07:26.329
..resignation.

07:27.329 --> 07:30.309
Or a completely ruined reputation.

07:54.349 --> 07:57.368
The state's corruption watchdog
has you in their crosshairs.

07:57.369 --> 08:00.284
When will you resign
from the royal commission?

08:00.285 --> 08:01.332
Not today, thank you.

08:01.333 --> 08:04.292
Have you lost the Premier's
confidence, Commissioner King?

08:04.293 --> 08:06.296
Have you spoken
to the Attorney-General yet?

08:06.297 --> 08:09.709
So you still won't say
who you were with or where you were.

08:09.734 --> 08:12.280
It's getting harder to remember,
actually.

08:12.281 --> 08:15.352
It was Australia Day, Major Hamilton,
not any ordinary day of the week.

08:15.353 --> 08:19.316
You know American psychologists ran
a test on 3,000 witnesses of 9/11?

08:19.317 --> 08:20.364
Yes, I'm aware of that.

08:20.365 --> 08:23.304
They all thought they'd never forget
who they were with.

08:23.305 --> 08:26.285
They were interviewed a day
later, one year later, two years...

08:26.285 --> 08:28.371
Three years, yes,
and they were only 57% accurate.

08:28.372 --> 08:31.372
Though they swore that their memory
of that day was crystal clear.

08:31.373 --> 08:34.344
Great. But we're talking
about a couple of months ago.

08:34.345 --> 08:37.304
And the thing is, we have evidence
from another witness

08:37.304 --> 08:39.288
saying he was with you that night.

08:39.289 --> 08:41.312
Do you have any idea
who that might be?

08:41.313 --> 08:44.308
He might have just thought he
was with me. Memory is unreliable.

08:44.309 --> 08:46.324
OK, let's come back to that
in a second.

08:46.325 --> 08:48.336
How about we deal
with an indisputable fact?

08:48.337 --> 08:51.396
Earlier in January,
your mobile was called by a phone

08:51.397 --> 08:52.476
belonging to a man
called Brett Bonar.

08:52.477 --> 08:55.332
That phone call lasted nine minutes.

08:55.333 --> 08:57.333
Do you recall talking to Mr Bonar?

08:57.358 --> 08:59.301
No.

08:59.301 --> 09:02.333
Well, this memory thing's tricky,
isn't it?

09:04.337 --> 09:06.455
OK, let me see
if I can help you out.

09:09.361 --> 09:12.284
This was deleted from your phone
a few months ago,

09:12.285 --> 09:14.324
but not before you organised
to meet the man in that photo,

09:14.325 --> 09:17.149
who, by the way,
is known to us as Robbie Carter,

09:17.174 --> 09:20.098
and who told us
you and he had met many times.

09:21.297 --> 09:24.304
So our question to you,
our specific question,

09:24.305 --> 09:26.336
notwithstanding
your appalling memory,

09:26.337 --> 09:28.316
is was the night of Australia Day

09:28.317 --> 09:31.259
one of the nights
you and he spent together or not?

09:33.297 --> 09:35.368
"If we really want to hide something,
we usually can."

09:35.369 --> 09:39.487
That was in your statement at the
inquest into Corporal Allman's death,

09:39.488 --> 09:40.559
wasn't it, Major Hamilton?

09:40.560 --> 09:43.324
Your denial and evasiveness
implies to me

09:43.325 --> 09:46.336
that you have a connection to the
crimes under our terms of reference,

09:46.337 --> 09:49.308
the details of which
I can assure you will be published

09:49.309 --> 09:52.427
unless other more innocent
explanations come to light.

09:52.452 --> 09:55.496
So, Mr Hamilton,
the phone call with Brett Bonar...

10:06.317 --> 10:07.494
I...I never met him.

10:10.281 --> 10:12.321
It was just the one... one call.

10:13.321 --> 10:16.316
Robbie had told him
about a 3D gun I'd given him.

10:16.317 --> 10:18.316
What, you just gave him the gun?

10:18.317 --> 10:19.372
They don't work that well.

10:19.373 --> 10:21.344
It was more like a souvenir.

10:21.345 --> 10:24.289
The program
came out of an army trial.

10:25.345 --> 10:28.332
I was never gonna use it
a-a-and Robbie found it fascinating,

10:28.333 --> 10:30.324
so I said, "Fine. Take it."

10:30.325 --> 10:34.324
Then he knew
this... other guy somehow

10:34.325 --> 10:36.304
and the next thing I know

10:36.305 --> 10:38.776
he's calling up
saying, "Can we do a deal?"

10:38.801 --> 10:41.789
If I printed out 100 or so,
he'd buy them off me.

10:42.305 --> 10:45.305
And you said...?
I told him to piss off and grow up.

10:45.305 --> 10:48.717
I wasn't about to become
an arms dealer. I love my country.

10:48.742 --> 10:51.390
OK. And what about the night
of Australia Day?

10:57.317 --> 10:59.289
Alright.

11:00.289 --> 11:01.368
Yes...

11:01.369 --> 11:04.328
..I was at home.

11:04.329 --> 11:06.317
With Robbie.

11:07.317 --> 11:09.293
And he came over about six.

11:10.325 --> 11:11.373
And left when?

11:16.313 --> 11:19.308
Well, he... he got the call

11:19.309 --> 11:22.296
about his... wife's accident.

11:22.297 --> 11:23.592
It was maybe nine-ish.

11:23.617 --> 11:25.617
He left straight for the hospital.

11:26.349 --> 11:28.324
His wife...?

11:28.325 --> 11:30.301
Yes.

11:31.301 --> 11:34.654
Thank you, Major Hamilton.
Let's take a short adjournment.

11:34.679 --> 11:36.683
Now?
Half an hour.

11:45.297 --> 11:48.289
There's Karen
getting into Todd's car.

11:51.297 --> 11:53.300
And Todd driving off.

11:53.301 --> 11:55.332
Keep going.

11:55.333 --> 11:57.317
Bit longer.

11:59.369 --> 12:02.296
There. See that car
turning around to follow him?

12:02.297 --> 12:04.945
What was Jane Carter driving
when she crashed?

12:04.970 --> 12:06.332
Ford Falcon. QRP-278.

12:06.333 --> 12:08.292
She was already following him.

12:08.293 --> 12:10.324
Maybe she learned
the other person in their marriage

12:10.325 --> 12:11.443
was Simon Hamilton.

12:11.468 --> 12:13.316
Let's look Simon up.

12:13.317 --> 12:17.259
We won't see a picture of Simon,
because he's ex-SAS, still serving.

12:17.284 --> 12:19.240
But there it is - click on that.

12:19.369 --> 12:21.352
Todd Wilson.

12:21.353 --> 12:23.308
The website he set up.

12:23.309 --> 12:25.340
Impersonating Simon Hamilton
to buy the Ferrari,

12:25.341 --> 12:27.344
but using his real work address.

12:27.345 --> 12:31.308
So Jane Carter takes her husband's
plastic gun from the wardrobe,

12:31.309 --> 12:34.280
goes to the address,
sees Todd knock off work,

12:34.281 --> 12:35.870
thinks it's Simon Hamilton.

12:35.895 --> 12:37.304
Follows him...

12:37.305 --> 12:38.600
Oi, mate!
..shoots him.

12:38.625 --> 12:41.288
The barrel of the gun flies back,

12:41.289 --> 12:45.172
which explains that injury on her
forehead with the plastic shards.

12:45.197 --> 12:48.244
And the woman Keisha heard screaming
wasn't a witness - it was Jane.

12:48.373 --> 12:52.304
So she speeds off with concussion,
isn't really watching the road

12:52.305 --> 12:54.324
and smashes into George Healy.

12:54.325 --> 12:56.304
And the gun's plastic.

12:56.305 --> 12:58.328
So it melted.

12:58.329 --> 13:00.316
So it was Jane the whole time.

13:00.317 --> 13:01.372
What the hell's going on?

13:01.373 --> 13:03.356
I thought you said
we hadn't finished yet.

13:03.357 --> 13:06.312
Look, I think we've got all we need.
What does that mean?

13:06.313 --> 13:08.324
What are you putting
in your report? At least...

13:08.325 --> 13:10.288
I'd advise you to move away.

13:10.289 --> 13:13.172
Alright, alright. Five minutes, yes?
Stay up here.

13:14.293 --> 13:15.352
Come to my office.

13:18.341 --> 13:20.340
I have a right to privacy

13:20.341 --> 13:23.340
and I'm tired of the way you look
at me like I'm a thickhead bully.

13:23.341 --> 13:25.577
Be honest with yourself,
Major Hamilton

13:25.602 --> 13:29.352
I am. Privacy and honesty
are not mutually exclusive.

13:29.353 --> 13:31.312
I thought you'd understand that.

13:31.313 --> 13:34.296
Aren't you facing a public hearing
over a personal text message?

13:34.297 --> 13:36.364
There's no reason to say more
about your actions in my report

13:36.365 --> 13:39.324
than I need to.
You've got no need to say anything.

13:39.325 --> 13:42.325
Major, the gun that killed
Todd Wilson came from you

13:42.326 --> 13:44.329
and ironically
the bullet was meant for you.

13:44.330 --> 13:47.324
These facts have to be included
in my report.

13:47.325 --> 13:49.372
You cannot keep saying
that you have nothing to do

13:49.373 --> 13:52.284
with the tragedies
that happen around you.

13:52.285 --> 13:54.292
Are you referring
to Corporal Allman's suicide?

13:54.293 --> 13:56.324
If you want to raise that.
What was my crime there?

13:56.325 --> 13:58.312
No crime, but no honesty either.

13:58.313 --> 14:00.289
Obviously he wasn't coping

14:00.289 --> 14:02.340
and can I suggest
you haven't coped in the past either?

14:02.341 --> 14:05.753
But rather than that breeding
compassion, it bred contempt.

14:05.778 --> 14:09.014
You said the bullet
was meant for me. What did you mean?

14:13.321 --> 14:15.304
The Ferrari that was bought
in your name,

14:15.305 --> 14:18.541
that was Todd Wilson as you -
he'd stolen your identity.

14:18.542 --> 14:20.778
And the bullet that... that killed him

14:20.803 --> 14:24.478
came from your Liberator
3D printed gun.

14:25.305 --> 14:27.289
Jane?

14:28.329 --> 14:30.325
That's all I'm prepared to say.

14:31.349 --> 14:35.284
Two men have died and a woman
is close to death, in large part,

14:35.285 --> 14:38.638
I believe, because you've
never been honest with yourself.

14:39.373 --> 14:41.336
My report will state the facts

14:41.337 --> 14:44.926
and sequence of events relating
to firearm crime - that's all.

15:28.313 --> 15:30.324
Are you gonna charge her?

15:30.325 --> 15:32.373
If she wakes up.

15:34.305 --> 15:37.280
That's a matter for the police.

15:37.281 --> 15:40.296
But given the circumstances, I'll...

15:40.297 --> 15:43.945
..I'll be referring it to them
and recommending murder charges.

15:47.353 --> 15:50.324
It's all my fault.
You didn't fire the gun.

15:50.325 --> 15:52.353
Well, I may as well have.

15:57.361 --> 15:59.332
It's gonna go public, isn't it?

15:59.333 --> 16:03.316
And then all those people
that came out to help us...

16:03.317 --> 16:05.333
Yes.

16:09.317 --> 16:11.317
I love her.

16:13.357 --> 16:15.416
It was never meant to be like this.

16:18.365 --> 16:20.361
I never wanted to lose her.

16:50.333 --> 16:52.284
Elaheh.

16:52.285 --> 16:56.300
No. No. Miss King,
we are on our way to the airport.

16:56.301 --> 16:57.356
Are you all going back?
No, just Sam.

16:57.357 --> 16:59.308
Please, we have the answers.

16:59.309 --> 17:01.312
Please go.
Answers hardly matter now.

17:01.313 --> 17:04.078
We know who killed Todd -
why, what for. Please.

17:04.103 --> 17:07.045
Hear it from me
before it's out there for everyone.

17:11.333 --> 17:13.288
It's OK, you stay.

17:13.289 --> 17:15.333
It doesn't bother us.

17:26.289 --> 17:27.584
Please take care, Sam.

17:27.608 --> 17:30.617
It's OK. I'll be fine.

17:46.369 --> 17:49.312
Mistaken identity.

17:49.313 --> 17:52.320
So it was all
just a stupid accident?

17:52.321 --> 17:54.309
It was a tragedy of errors.

17:55.353 --> 17:58.316
His actions did lead
to his own death,

17:58.317 --> 18:00.788
but it's also true
that Todd wasn't the man

18:00.813 --> 18:02.781
Jane was trying to hurt.

18:04.293 --> 18:07.316
We were looking for an enemy,
when sadly he didn't have one.

18:07.317 --> 18:09.296
Which I told you all along.

18:09.297 --> 18:11.336
But you never believed me.

18:11.337 --> 18:14.514
Everyone kept telling me
that I didn't know my husband,

18:14.539 --> 18:15.352
but I did.

18:15.353 --> 18:18.329
I knew that he never had enemies.

18:19.365 --> 18:22.836
I know that he wasn't perfect,
but he wouldn't hurt anybody.

18:26.301 --> 18:29.332
Maybe you don't really have an enemy
either, Janet.

18:29.333 --> 18:32.297
Maybe you create them.

18:34.325 --> 18:37.309
Dogs only chase people who run away.

18:43.293 --> 18:44.368
After all that effort,

18:44.369 --> 18:47.328
Todd's murder didn't help us
solve the big picture at all.

18:47.329 --> 18:50.304
Well, never assume everything's
part of a big conspiracy,

18:50.305 --> 18:51.894
because most things aren't,

18:51.919 --> 18:55.851
they're just individual moments
of idiocy and desperation.

18:56.349 --> 18:58.348
So who's behind it all?

18:58.349 --> 19:00.328
We know these weapons
are being imported

19:00.329 --> 19:02.292
by someone Brett was working for.

19:02.293 --> 19:04.340
On the other hand,
Brett took any job he was offered.

19:04.341 --> 19:07.352
We can narrow it down to one of
the guys on his 'dirty jobs' phone.

19:07.353 --> 19:10.942
Which means it was either a name
so far totally off our radar,

19:10.967 --> 19:16.280
like Ahmed or Luigi or Simon,
Robbie, Bao Long or Patrick.

19:16.281 --> 19:19.288
Whoever it is has so far made
no attempt to pick up a container

19:19.289 --> 19:21.324
that would give them
a multimillion-dollar payday.

19:21.325 --> 19:24.300
Nonetheless, we have to prove
who it is before next Wednesday,

19:24.301 --> 19:27.066
before the corruption commission
hearing starts.

19:27.091 --> 19:28.324
Or...?
We've lost.

19:28.325 --> 19:30.321
Everything.

19:34.301 --> 19:36.292
So instead of sitting here
staring at each other

19:36.293 --> 19:37.344
let's keep asking questions.

19:37.345 --> 19:40.352
Why was Patrick talking to Brett?
Any ideas?

19:40.353 --> 19:43.340
He never mentioned him to me.
Would he tell us if we asked him?

19:43.341 --> 19:46.812
He'd tell us something -
we'd have to work out if it's true.

19:46.837 --> 19:48.304
Patrick's not a liar.

19:48.305 --> 19:49.541
Well, time's ticking.

19:49.566 --> 19:53.498
Let's see if you're right, shall we?

19:57.281 --> 19:59.328
How long have you known Patrick?

19:59.329 --> 20:02.447
10 years maybe. I don't think
he'd be into this stuff.

20:02.472 --> 20:06.316
But you never know, I guess.
Janet, have any of you lost an iPad?

20:06.317 --> 20:09.082
Because I found this in the bin
around the side.

20:09.107 --> 20:12.316
Yeah. Just hang on a sec.
Yep, cool.

20:18.321 --> 20:20.373
Yep?

20:20.373 --> 20:22.369
Yeah, sure. Coming now.

20:24.337 --> 20:26.336
Change of plan - you're on.

20:26.337 --> 20:29.345
Right. Can you finish that
and let me know?

20:31.349 --> 20:33.344
OK, you go with Heather now.
Any questions?

20:33.345 --> 20:36.288
No, all good and
if I have to work with her again,

20:36.289 --> 20:38.288
I guess I'll cope.
You might learn something.

20:38.289 --> 20:40.356
About hair curlers or interrogation?
Do I get a loading for this?

20:40.357 --> 20:42.328
Just keep an open mind, OK?

20:42.329 --> 20:44.300
Always.

20:44.301 --> 20:45.348
So this is yours?
Yes.

20:45.349 --> 20:47.360
Where was it?
Just around the side.

20:47.361 --> 20:49.324
It was under the big green bins.

20:49.325 --> 20:51.344
I was just chucking some stuff out
and I saw it.

20:51.345 --> 20:53.404
And it went missing the night after

20:53.405 --> 20:55.464
she said she saw that Asian guy
hanging around, didn't it?

20:55.465 --> 20:57.368
Yeah.
Have you seen him again?

20:57.369 --> 21:00.312
Um, no. He was just here that once.

21:00.313 --> 21:03.328
But he was over there
and that was around here.

21:03.329 --> 21:06.288
Do you want me to show you?
Yeah, I'll...

21:06.289 --> 21:07.352
You go back inside,
I'll take a look.

21:07.353 --> 21:09.321
Thanks, Peta.
No, that's OK.

21:15.305 --> 21:18.300
Did I, did I tell you my
proposal for the recreation centre

21:18.301 --> 21:20.288
might be coming back into favour?

21:20.289 --> 21:22.368
Fantastic. You match what Bao Long
was gonna pay for the land?

21:22.369 --> 21:28.284
No. A... report hit the press about
the use of poker machines in NSW.

21:28.285 --> 21:30.304
Even though there were
300 less of them last year,

21:30.305 --> 21:32.600
$3 billion more
got pumped through them.

21:32.601 --> 21:35.778
Yep, direct correlation
with divorce rates, depression,

21:35.803 --> 21:37.324
domestic abuse, etc.

21:37.325 --> 21:40.502
So, politically, it's
a touchy subject all of a sudden.

21:40.503 --> 21:42.534
Funny how reports hit the press
at opportune times.

21:42.535 --> 21:44.328
Isn't it, though?

21:44.329 --> 21:47.280
I've often had that sort of luck.

21:47.281 --> 21:48.368
Just born under a good star,
I suppose.

21:48.369 --> 21:52.365
Still, I'm sure you're not really
here to discuss netball courts.

21:52.365 --> 21:55.660
No, we're here to ask you
about a guy called Brett Bonar.

21:55.685 --> 21:57.372
Who we know you knew.

21:57.373 --> 22:01.308
Well, I had a few conversations
with him. I wouldn't go too far.

22:01.309 --> 22:03.721
A shame we didn't hear about that
earlier.

22:03.722 --> 22:06.722
And not much just slips your mind,
does it, Patrick?

22:06.747 --> 22:09.280
No.
No, it was a deliberate omission.

22:09.281 --> 22:10.360
Guilty as charged.

22:10.361 --> 22:12.324
I'm sorry, Heather.

22:12.325 --> 22:14.293
So what were the conversations?

22:15.293 --> 22:17.308
You know how those boys
broke into my car, right?

22:17.309 --> 22:19.015
You said you didn't know who.

22:19.040 --> 22:21.980
I think I was careful
with the way I worded that.

22:22.333 --> 22:24.332
Look, full disclosure -

22:24.333 --> 22:28.284
I found my car had been broken into,
I got a mate of mine on the force

22:28.285 --> 22:30.332
to access the CCTV footage
of the car park,

22:30.333 --> 22:32.312
look up the license plate
on their car

22:32.313 --> 22:33.364
and get me Brett's phone number.

22:33.365 --> 22:35.660
He accessed the police database
for you?

22:35.685 --> 22:37.284
Who said it was a he?

22:37.285 --> 22:40.308
And I'm not dropping him in it,
so don't ask me for names, alright?

22:40.309 --> 22:43.324
There are many people in
the south-west who owe me a favour.

22:43.325 --> 22:46.284
When you called Brett,
what did you say to him?

22:46.285 --> 22:47.372
I told him
I wanted my cigar box back.

22:47.373 --> 22:49.324
I mean, I liked Brett.

22:49.325 --> 22:51.308
And he did try and make amends.
How?

22:51.309 --> 22:53.308
He bought me a bottle of Scotch
to say sorry

22:53.309 --> 22:54.356
when he couldn't.

22:54.357 --> 22:58.308
Apparently, Todd had already
passed it on to a mate of his.

22:58.309 --> 22:59.344
Who?

22:59.345 --> 23:04.284
Look, I'm not certain and it might
just sound like sour grapes...

23:04.285 --> 23:05.320
Patrick.

23:05.321 --> 23:07.316
That box was full of cigars.

23:07.317 --> 23:09.328
Puente Estate Real.

23:09.329 --> 23:13.324
And if you check some photos
in the local paper last week,

23:13.325 --> 23:15.316
you'll see a certain businessman

23:15.317 --> 23:18.297
happens to be smoking
just that brand.

23:21.317 --> 23:23.364
You didn't hear it from me.

23:23.365 --> 23:26.360
So Brett was working for Bao,
so was George Healy.

23:26.361 --> 23:29.308
Bao has the setup and contacts
to offload those guns

23:29.309 --> 23:30.368
in the quantities
we're talking about.

23:30.369 --> 23:32.664
I take it his DNA
isn't on the database.

23:32.689 --> 23:36.288
No criminal record, so at the moment
we couldn't test to see

23:36.289 --> 23:39.304
if he was the second man with Brett
at George's murder anyway.

23:39.305 --> 23:41.364
Let's get a sample of his DNA then.

23:41.365 --> 23:44.376
How? He won't give consent and we
can't just take it. That's a crime.

23:44.377 --> 23:47.296
Well,
not if it's freely discarded.

23:47.297 --> 23:49.316
We get him in here,
question, question, question.

23:49.317 --> 23:51.284
As long
as he leaves something behind

23:51.285 --> 23:55.050
or throws something in the bin,
like a paper cup or a gum wrapper

23:55.075 --> 23:56.131
or a tissue,
then we're home and hosed.

23:57.317 --> 23:59.329
Can we... can we do this tomorrow?

23:59.330 --> 24:01.340
Good luck.
Thanks!

24:01.341 --> 24:04.284
In the meantime, let's find out
as much as we can, OK?

24:04.285 --> 24:05.368
Known associates,
patterns of movement,

24:05.369 --> 24:07.372
when and how long the calls lasted
with Brett.

24:07.373 --> 24:10.324
We need him to concentrate so much
on his answers,

24:10.325 --> 24:12.620
he's not thinking
about things like DNA.

24:17.289 --> 24:19.364
Don't you ever answer
that bloody phone of yours?

24:19.365 --> 24:22.356
Sorry.
I thought you might be a no-show.

24:22.357 --> 24:25.312
Why? Grounds for appeal
aren't that strong, are they?

24:25.313 --> 24:27.304
Still gonna be stressful.
Come on, Tony.

24:27.305 --> 24:29.352
If anyone knows
confrontation in court, it's me.

24:29.353 --> 24:33.284
This case is personal. You were
drained after the first hearing.

24:33.285 --> 24:35.328
Appeals are about points of law.
It's totally different.

24:35.329 --> 24:37.284
There's nothing personal about today

24:37.285 --> 24:40.933
as long as you eat her up and spit
her out as soon as possible.

24:40.958 --> 24:44.606
Great. Well, I'm glad you've
got life in perspective today.

24:44.631 --> 24:48.296
In the appeal of Deborah Larsson
against Janet King,

24:48.297 --> 24:51.356
we have considered the appellant's
grounds for appeal

24:51.381 --> 24:55.296
and the respondent's submissions
to the contrary.

24:55.297 --> 24:59.352
We are in a position
to make a decision today.

24:59.353 --> 25:03.292
Mrs Larsson, you are
representing yourself, correct?

25:03.293 --> 25:04.344
Yes, Your Honour.

25:04.345 --> 25:06.640
Your Honour's gonna
roast her for lunch.

25:06.665 --> 25:10.292
Mr Gillies?
Appearing for Ms King, Your Honour.

25:10.293 --> 25:12.328
You can sit down, Mr Gillies.

25:14.325 --> 25:16.304
Your best points, Ms Larsson.

25:16.305 --> 25:18.304
I'm sorry. I... I, um...

25:18.305 --> 25:20.658
I'm not used to the way
things work here.

25:20.683 --> 25:22.731
We'll make allowances, Ms Larsson.

25:24.337 --> 25:27.573
But I believe that Justice Stanton's
findings in my case

25:27.598 --> 25:29.606
were incorrect in law.

25:31.329 --> 25:34.624
In granting possession
of the fertilised embryo to Janet,

25:34.649 --> 25:39.324
she failed to answer the fundamental
question posed by my application.

25:39.325 --> 25:43.340
Is the fertilised embryo capable
of being classified as property?

25:43.341 --> 25:46.288
Or is it something else entirely?

25:46.289 --> 25:48.324
Legally, is it a potential life?

25:48.325 --> 25:51.324
That's exactly the line
I'd have taken.

25:51.325 --> 25:53.292
And if this is the case,

25:53.293 --> 25:56.308
Justice Stanton should have given
more weight to what happened to it.

25:56.309 --> 26:01.284
You argue that the fertilised embryo
should be declared potential life

26:01.285 --> 26:04.324
and therefore its usage should be
determined in line with this?

26:04.325 --> 26:07.855
Yes and because Justice Stanton
failed to make that decision,

26:07.880 --> 26:09.844
her ruling should be overturned.

26:11.293 --> 26:13.764
Which... which brings me
to my final point.

26:13.789 --> 26:17.709
I see this embryo
as a potential baby of mine

26:18.225 --> 26:22.284
and a potential niece or nephew of
my sister, who's no longer with us.

26:22.285 --> 26:24.292
Where is the law in this,
Your Honour?

26:24.293 --> 26:27.308
There is an absence of direct
precedent concerning this area.

26:27.309 --> 26:28.356
You'd be quite aware of that.

26:28.357 --> 26:32.308
I thought we'd be required to base
our arguments in law, Your Honour.

26:32.309 --> 26:34.364
The appellant may not have
your training, Mr Gillies,

26:34.365 --> 26:36.364
but she has a right to be heard.

26:36.365 --> 26:38.321
Sit down.

26:43.321 --> 26:45.297
Will we talk about usage?

26:46.329 --> 26:50.284
I intent to use that embryo
to fulfil its potential.

26:50.285 --> 26:52.280
I want to see that baby live

26:52.281 --> 26:55.285
and that's what my sister Ash
wanted as well.

26:57.293 --> 26:59.764
- ButwhatdoesJanetwant?
- Your Honour!

26:59.789 --> 27:02.296
She doesn't know.

27:02.297 --> 27:03.365
Probably, because she's so busy,

27:03.365 --> 27:06.280
she'll just let it sit there
in that facility

27:06.281 --> 27:08.929
until it's too late
and she has to destroy it.

27:08.954 --> 27:12.954
She'd rather keep that embryo on ice
than give it the chance to live.

27:13.329 --> 27:16.297
And that is not what Ash wanted.

27:21.325 --> 27:23.293
Mr Gillies?

27:24.293 --> 27:26.360
Your Honour,
our position is clear at law.

27:26.361 --> 27:28.479
I ask to keep the emotion out of it.

27:28.504 --> 27:30.352
Your point, Mr Gillies?

27:30.353 --> 27:33.292
For the fertilised embryo

27:33.293 --> 27:34.340
to be determined a potential life,

27:34.341 --> 27:37.283
there needs to be some certainty
of this happening.

27:37.308 --> 27:40.308
Ms Larsson is 39 -
the chances of a woman her age

27:40.309 --> 27:42.074
having a successful implanting

27:42.099 --> 27:45.320
of a single embryo
that's been frozen for four years

27:45.321 --> 27:47.304
is less than 10%.

27:47.305 --> 27:49.894
For the embryo to be declared
potential life,

27:49.919 --> 27:53.332
its chances of a successful implant
need to be greater?

27:53.333 --> 27:55.320
Thank you, Your Honour.

27:55.321 --> 27:58.312
This embryo is stored at a facility.

27:58.313 --> 28:00.608
Ms King and her partner
Ashleigh Larsson

28:00.633 --> 28:03.284
entered into a contract
with this facility.

28:03.285 --> 28:06.300
They signed the consent form,
they paid the bills.

28:06.301 --> 28:09.596
Legally, this embryo has always
had standing as property.

28:09.621 --> 28:15.280
Ash Larsson left her property to
Ms King in the event of her death.

28:15.281 --> 28:20.281
As such, this embryo
belongs to the respondent.

28:21.321 --> 28:24.373
And what does Ms King intend to do
with this embryo?

28:26.301 --> 28:28.340
Your Honour, as it's her property,

28:28.341 --> 28:32.312
my client's intentions
are irrelevant.

28:32.313 --> 28:34.312
Very well.

28:34.313 --> 28:37.308
The court will take
a short adjournment

28:37.309 --> 28:40.313
to consider its judgment.

28:54.325 --> 28:57.332
Things are going well then?
With the girlfriend?

28:57.333 --> 28:59.372
I'm not sure
we've made it that official.

28:59.373 --> 29:01.372
Are you dating anyone else?
No.

29:01.373 --> 29:03.550
Would you?
If the opportunity came up?

29:04.361 --> 29:07.280
No.
She's as good as your girlfriend.

29:07.281 --> 29:08.356
You'll be signing a lease together
next.

29:08.357 --> 29:11.372
Probably not.
She's about to head overseas.

29:11.373 --> 29:15.284
How's your frequent flyer
balance?

29:19.309 --> 29:20.604
Janet, how's it going?

29:20.629 --> 29:23.300
Is Andy back with my iPad?
I haven't seen him.

29:23.301 --> 29:25.348
Can you tell him I shouldn't be
too much longer here.

29:25.349 --> 29:27.702
And to text me
with any information, yes?

29:27.727 --> 29:30.671
Right, sure.
Thanks.

29:48.289 --> 29:50.309
It was you, wasn't it?

29:52.373 --> 29:56.289
The anonymous call
that could end my career.

30:06.337 --> 30:08.808
What do you think Ash
would say about that?

30:08.833 --> 30:11.288
I did not mean for it to...

30:11.289 --> 30:13.289
..blow up like that.

30:14.289 --> 30:16.054
And we're really sorry, Janet.

30:16.079 --> 30:19.320
But Ash said that embryo
could be mine.

30:19.321 --> 30:21.337
It was meant for me.

30:23.321 --> 30:25.333
And that's what Ash really wanted.

30:28.353 --> 30:30.353
It really was.

30:31.373 --> 30:33.373
We're back.

30:57.361 --> 31:02.320
In the appeal of Deborah Larsson
against Janet King,

31:02.321 --> 31:05.285
we have considered both submissions
carefully.

31:06.341 --> 31:11.372
This is a complex matter and future
judges may choose to revisit it.

31:11.373 --> 31:14.352
As the law stands, however,

31:14.353 --> 31:18.336
Ms King, as the de facto partner

31:18.337 --> 31:21.280
of the deceased
at the time of her death,

31:21.281 --> 31:23.280
has title to that embryo.

31:23.281 --> 31:25.458
Therefore, we find
for the respondent.

31:25.483 --> 31:30.439
The appeal is dismissed and the
decision of the trial judge stands.

31:47.365 --> 31:49.365
Come on, Janet.

32:08.337 --> 32:11.288
Congratulations.
Did he rule on potential life...

32:11.289 --> 32:12.345
They ruled it's my property.

32:12.345 --> 32:14.368
I knew it. It had to be.
It's not alive.

32:14.369 --> 32:17.351
Keep the definitions black and
white, they had to rule your way.

32:17.352 --> 32:19.823
But it's an embryo.
Frozen, not developing.

32:19.848 --> 32:21.320
But fertilised.
Obviously.

32:21.321 --> 32:24.851
Do you believe it's property?
Or was it just to win the case?

32:25.297 --> 32:27.320
I'm just curious, that's all.

32:27.321 --> 32:31.280
Well, just because it might
become life doesn't mean it will.

32:31.281 --> 32:33.348
And if it isn't yet,
then it's property.

32:33.349 --> 32:36.526
When does it become life, though?
That's the grey area.

32:36.551 --> 32:39.364
When do you think it does?
I don't know, I...

32:39.365 --> 32:42.424
Well, earlier than I would have said
a few weeks ago.

32:42.449 --> 32:46.324
Examining the case law has
challenged my preconceptions too.

32:46.325 --> 32:48.284
You're not, are you?
Yeah.

32:48.285 --> 32:50.284
Fantastic!
Congratulations.

32:50.285 --> 32:52.285
What?
She's pregnant!

32:53.297 --> 32:56.288
I...I thought you couldn't,
'cause you had...

32:56.289 --> 32:59.284
Idiopathic infertility.
So did I.

32:59.285 --> 33:02.308
Well done for Taterhead?
Little spuds.

33:02.309 --> 33:04.288
You told them.
Yeah, they guessed.

33:04.289 --> 33:06.878
I don't know how,
I didn't say anything much.

33:06.903 --> 33:08.867
Techies brought in the...

33:09.301 --> 33:10.357
Thanks.

33:12.341 --> 33:15.364
It had prints all over it.
Lots of people have picked it up.

33:15.365 --> 33:17.364
Why pick it up and dump it?

33:17.365 --> 33:19.320
It could have been kids

33:19.321 --> 33:21.352
who picked it up
and couldn't guess your password,

33:21.353 --> 33:23.308
so they threw it away.

33:23.309 --> 33:26.341
The tech guys say
it hasn't been opened for 11 days.

33:27.357 --> 33:29.356
Alright.

33:29.357 --> 33:32.281
Well, it looks like
everything's here.

33:34.313 --> 33:36.369
Hang on.
What?

33:37.369 --> 33:41.289
Well... there was a whole album here.

33:42.289 --> 33:43.341
What's happened?

33:44.365 --> 33:46.333
Looks like it's been deleted.

33:47.333 --> 33:50.628
There were photos of Ash and...
You sure they were there?

33:50.653 --> 33:53.645
Yes! It was definitely here
and it's been deleted.

33:59.293 --> 34:01.292
When did you say this was dumped?

34:01.293 --> 34:03.293
11 days ago?
Yeah, at least.

34:05.293 --> 34:08.315
I want to move... move home tonight.

34:08.317 --> 34:10.348
That's pretty sudden.
I've been thinking about it.

34:10.349 --> 34:13.702
If Ash's killer wanted to hurt me,
they would have by now.

34:13.726 --> 34:15.904
They're just trying
to scare me and...

34:16.353 --> 34:18.368
..I'm tired of running, Andy.

34:18.369 --> 34:22.348
If I live in that motel, they win.
And...

34:22.349 --> 34:25.315
..it would be a lot cheaper
for the Federal Police

34:25.317 --> 34:28.280
just to put a bodyguard at my house.

34:28.281 --> 34:31.320
OK. I'll get it organised,
move your stuff back.

34:31.321 --> 34:33.321
I'll get you a spare key.

34:42.341 --> 34:44.312
Peta.

34:44.313 --> 34:46.348
Um, I'm sorry, Janet,
I've just cleaned up the machine.

34:46.349 --> 34:48.585
No, no. I just wanted
to say thank you.

34:48.610 --> 34:51.331
Thank you for finding my iPad,
thank you...

34:51.333 --> 34:53.371
Thank you for plying us
with good quality caffeine.

34:53.373 --> 34:56.280
As you can tell,
we live on the stuff, so...

34:56.281 --> 34:58.634
Well, I stop at six
and I move onto wine.

34:58.659 --> 35:00.352
A girl after my own heart.

35:00.353 --> 35:02.706
I'll be at the Belly Black Bar
in an hour

35:02.731 --> 35:05.288
if you want to share a glass
with me.

35:05.289 --> 35:07.304
Or not. No, I mean...

35:07.305 --> 35:09.300
If you think it's inappropriate.
No, no.

35:09.301 --> 35:11.328
Or you're probably busy
because I know you're...

35:11.329 --> 35:13.296
..you're pretty important right now.

35:13.297 --> 35:14.344
I wouldn't get too carried away.

35:14.345 --> 35:16.336
Then the offer stands,
if you're interested.

35:16.337 --> 35:19.632
A splash of cold climate chardonnay
to wash away the day.

35:19.633 --> 35:21.810
You know your wines, do you?
Yeah.

35:21.835 --> 35:24.281
Evidence of a misspent youth, sadly.

35:24.281 --> 35:26.284
Or an anxiety management program.

35:26.285 --> 35:28.815
Give you a tip -
long term, it doesn't work.

35:28.840 --> 35:30.803
So I might see you there then?

35:32.329 --> 35:34.293
I'll see you there.

35:58.365 --> 36:00.344
Mm, now that looks...

36:00.345 --> 36:02.344
..expensive.

36:02.345 --> 36:04.757
Least I can do
for a wine connoisseur.

36:07.305 --> 36:09.305
Thank you.

36:12.373 --> 36:14.372
You driving?

36:14.373 --> 36:18.281
Yeah, I was going to.
But, well...

36:20.329 --> 36:22.329
I'll get a cab.

36:24.365 --> 36:26.365
Cheers.
Cheers.

36:35.289 --> 36:37.324
So...

36:37.325 --> 36:40.292
..tell me about the coffee business.
Mm.

36:40.293 --> 36:43.300
Well, it's not the most
exciting profession.

36:43.301 --> 36:46.317
People make it bearable.
Just bearable?

36:47.321 --> 36:52.289
OK, certain people make it...
mildly satisfactory.

37:00.313 --> 37:02.280
And, um...

37:02.281 --> 37:05.046
..how do you have fun
outside of business hours?

37:05.071 --> 37:08.288
I like to read.
Old dead Brits mostly.

37:08.289 --> 37:12.309
I like wine...
Literature and wine, a noble union.

37:13.321 --> 37:15.439
And we have something else
in common.

37:15.464 --> 37:17.352
But I'm sorry, it's, um...

37:17.353 --> 37:20.333
..it was a Google stalk.

37:22.333 --> 37:24.297
I've also lost a loved one.

37:28.289 --> 37:32.280
He got sick fast. So...

37:32.281 --> 37:34.320
And by that stage,
there was nothing they could do.

37:34.321 --> 37:36.324
The end was pretty quick.

37:36.325 --> 37:39.855
I mean, he wouldn't have felt much.
I guess that's something.

37:41.369 --> 37:44.288
When was this?

37:44.289 --> 37:45.642
It was a few years ago.

37:47.289 --> 37:49.345
I'msorry.
Yeah.

37:49.345 --> 37:52.285
It still sucks.

37:54.281 --> 37:57.870
I mean, it's really like looking
down this horrible black hole

37:57.895 --> 38:00.288
and it's just swallowing
all my energy.

38:00.289 --> 38:03.280
I don't know how deep that hole is.

38:03.281 --> 38:05.336
But if he'd been murdered, that...

38:05.337 --> 38:07.455
..that would have
done me in totally.

38:07.480 --> 38:09.460
That on top of everything.

38:10.313 --> 38:12.372
I don't know how you survived that.

38:14.281 --> 38:15.458
No, I didn't either.

38:16.353 --> 38:19.313
But then you do... somehow.

38:20.341 --> 38:22.348
You will too.

38:22.349 --> 38:24.305
One day, you'll feel stronger.

38:26.183 --> 38:29.360
It helps having the right people
around you. I don't...

38:29.361 --> 38:32.352
I don't think I could have
got through it without my kids.

38:32.353 --> 38:34.344
Yeah, I don't have
that support system.

38:34.345 --> 38:36.308
It doesn't need to be children.

38:36.309 --> 38:38.604
You just need
to find someone who can...

38:39.309 --> 38:41.320
..help you let him go.

38:41.321 --> 38:43.349
What if I think I have?

38:45.349 --> 38:48.938
Well, it has to be right for them
too. That's the tricky part.

38:49.349 --> 38:51.305
Yeah.

38:55.301 --> 38:57.353
We should get something to eat.

39:29.313 --> 39:31.368
I brought Not Donuts.

39:31.369 --> 39:33.487
I hear they've got
half the calories.

39:33.512 --> 39:36.448
Mm. Come in.

39:39.301 --> 39:41.324
Have you got any sisters?

39:41.325 --> 39:44.308
Otherwise, half of this
is going to charity.

39:44.309 --> 39:45.357
I have two.

39:46.357 --> 39:48.364
This is great.

39:48.365 --> 39:52.280
This will cover me
for both their birthdays,

39:52.281 --> 39:54.336
Christmas, next birthdays.

39:54.337 --> 39:56.320
Wow.

39:56.321 --> 39:58.300
Mm.

39:58.301 --> 40:01.292
So have you thought anymore about
meeting up at some stage?

40:01.293 --> 40:02.372
I have thought about it a lot.

40:02.373 --> 40:04.726
You don't have to get
on the same flight.

40:04.727 --> 40:07.139
Just whenever
the commission's wrapped up.

40:07.164 --> 40:09.320
It's neat in theory, but...

40:09.321 --> 40:14.292
..but the truth is I feel
like I've been treading water a bit.

40:14.293 --> 40:16.332
You know, professionally speaking.

40:16.333 --> 40:18.451
I'm at a critical juncture right now

40:18.452 --> 40:19.515
in terms
of where my career's headed.

40:19.516 --> 40:24.324
You could still work, once your
'critical juncture' has passed.

40:24.325 --> 40:26.324
Half of me wants to book a flight
right now,

40:26.325 --> 40:28.796
and the other half knows
I just... I can't.

40:28.821 --> 40:32.312
Well, I have no use
for half a boyfriend.

40:32.313 --> 40:34.368
I need 100% unadulterated Richard.

40:34.369 --> 40:36.368
When are you coming back?

40:36.369 --> 40:38.373
I don't know.

40:40.281 --> 40:44.372
Maybe I'll get sick of hostels
and run home in three months.

40:44.373 --> 40:47.336
Or maybe I'll fall in love
with Switzerland,

40:47.337 --> 40:50.320
get a job at a dairy farm
and stay two years.

40:50.321 --> 40:52.320
That is adorably specific.

40:52.321 --> 40:54.333
I've been doing a lot of reading.

40:58.369 --> 41:00.353
Look...

41:02.369 --> 41:05.320
I just...

41:05.321 --> 41:08.674
I just think that meeting you
has been kind of miraculous.

41:09.349 --> 41:11.348
It feels easy.

41:11.349 --> 41:14.317
It feels right.

41:37.349 --> 41:39.349
Nice to meet you, Barry.

41:52.305 --> 41:54.304
Until the commission's over,

41:54.305 --> 41:56.717
we'll be maintaining
household protection.

41:56.742 --> 41:59.722
They asked me if I wanted the job.

42:00.345 --> 42:02.337
Thank you for saying yes.

42:10.313 --> 42:14.285
OK. Home, sweet home.

42:17.325 --> 42:20.316
So, um...

42:20.317 --> 42:23.435
Tell me, how does this...
how does this actually work?

42:23.460 --> 42:25.328
Well, however you want it to.

42:25.329 --> 42:27.308
I won't be in your face 24/7.

42:27.309 --> 42:30.324
I'll be doing shifts in the car.

42:30.325 --> 42:33.372
It should feel
like I'm... not here.

42:33.373 --> 42:37.304
OK. But actually,
I wouldn't mind some company now.

42:37.305 --> 42:39.360
Unless your car's more appealing.

42:39.361 --> 42:41.832
If you don't want to be alone,
just say so.

42:41.857 --> 42:43.857
No, no. That's not what I mean.

42:45.285 --> 42:46.340
The last couple of weeks, you know,

42:46.341 --> 42:50.316
I've had to face a lot of things
about me, work and...

42:50.317 --> 42:52.376
..after the last two years, it's...

42:52.401 --> 42:55.312
..you know,
all these issues with Ash's sister

42:55.313 --> 42:58.365
and the corruption commission and...

43:00.293 --> 43:02.588
But now I feel like I'm ready,
you know,

43:02.613 --> 43:04.689
to face stuff, life and things.

43:06.297 --> 43:07.533
You know what I mean?

43:08.353 --> 43:11.589
That's the most confusing thing
I've ever heard you say.

43:19.361 --> 43:24.324
♪ Some days

43:24.325 --> 43:27.332
♪ You haunt

43:27.333 --> 43:31.329
♪ Do you feel it?

43:38.285 --> 43:42.300

43:42.301 --> 43:45.336

and I would... ♪

44:24.301 --> 44:25.369
Morning.

44:26.369 --> 44:30.300
Dutch analysis on the full human
genome of George and Ash's killer

44:30.301 --> 44:32.280
finally came through.

44:32.281 --> 44:36.336
Would you like me
to take you through it?

44:36.337 --> 44:39.304
Did I miss something?

44:39.305 --> 44:41.288
DNA results.

44:41.289 --> 44:43.288
Confirmation
of what we already know.

44:43.289 --> 44:45.364
Male, mixed ethnicity.
Part Caucasian.

44:45.365 --> 44:48.340
The rest is a United Nations.
Polynesian, Asian, Indigenous.

44:48.341 --> 44:51.364
Very hard without full morphology
to tell what this bloke'd look like.

44:51.365 --> 44:53.483
Any number of traits could dominate.

44:53.484 --> 44:56.471
Light brown hair, brown-green eyes.
Could be a million people.

44:56.472 --> 44:58.312
Can we get that morphology?

44:58.313 --> 45:01.372
They're doing it now,
but we have to pay more for it.

45:01.397 --> 45:05.280
Couldn't be evidence at trial,
so we can't use the police budget.

45:05.281 --> 45:07.304
That alright. I'll pay for it.

45:07.305 --> 45:10.288
There's a lot of information
without the full-face morphology.

45:10.289 --> 45:12.296
Like when he looks into the light,
he sneezes.

45:12.297 --> 45:14.308
Folds his arms left over right.

45:14.309 --> 45:15.356
We can tell that from DNA?

45:15.357 --> 45:18.333
There's a lot we can tell
with an 80%-90% likelihood.

45:18.333 --> 45:21.336
But often you have to combine the
mutation with environmental factors

45:21.337 --> 45:24.299
to know if it's activated -
I've only skimmed the headlines.

45:24.300 --> 45:25.348
There are pages here.

45:25.349 --> 45:28.316
It is the whole genome,
with over 70 listed mutations.

45:28.317 --> 45:31.304
Which is about average.
Wheredoesthisleavefreewill?

45:31.305 --> 45:33.340
Beyond my brief.
It's incredible, though, isn't it?

45:33.341 --> 45:35.459
What you can find out about someone?

45:35.484 --> 45:37.720
Bao Long's here.
When you're ready.

45:39.289 --> 45:42.284
Bao Long? I doubt he'll give you
a big confession.

45:42.285 --> 45:44.284
I'd settle for anything
at the moment.

45:44.285 --> 45:46.320
We might get some DNA,
which might link him to George,

45:46.321 --> 45:48.316
but the only thing
that'll save me now

45:48.317 --> 45:50.364
is nailing whoever's behind
this gun importation.

45:50.365 --> 45:53.332
Could be Bao Long too.
Yeah, buthowdoIprovethat?

45:53.333 --> 45:56.316
You need to set a trap.
How?

45:56.317 --> 45:59.332
And please, at this point in time,
there's no such thing as a bad idea.

45:59.333 --> 46:03.098
I'll look at anything. That importer
will lead me to Ash's killer

46:03.123 --> 46:06.107
and vice versa -
solve one, I get the other.

46:08.337 --> 46:11.344
Felix Murphy owed you
a substantial amount of money.

46:11.345 --> 46:13.300
Yeah, I don't recall.

46:13.301 --> 46:15.292
Mr Long, contempt of this commission

46:15.293 --> 46:18.360
and provision of false or misleading
evidence are punishable offences.

46:18.361 --> 46:21.773
You mean Felix? Yes,
I did extent him a line of credit.

46:21.798 --> 46:23.352
How much?

46:23.353 --> 46:26.328
In excess of $80,000 from memory.

46:26.329 --> 46:28.506
Are you still in touch
with Mr Murphy?

46:28.531 --> 46:31.356
Well, I heard
that he left the country.

46:31.357 --> 46:34.336
Recently?

46:34.337 --> 46:36.985
I don't recall where I learned that,
actually.

46:37.010 --> 46:40.069
Well, the money that he owed you,
do you recall that?

46:41.293 --> 46:43.292
Yes. I onsold it.

46:43.293 --> 46:44.360
To who?

46:44.361 --> 46:46.336
Let me see...

46:46.337 --> 46:47.360
Um...

46:47.361 --> 46:49.320
Mr Long.

46:49.321 --> 46:52.348
If you think that I shot Felix,
you're completely off.

46:52.349 --> 46:55.324
My nose is absolutely clean.
So who did shoot him?

46:55.325 --> 46:58.561
'Cause I can't believe
you wouldn't have heard anything.

46:58.586 --> 47:00.352
I don't know.
Whoboughtthedebt?

47:00.353 --> 47:03.530
Well, there are a number of agents
I sell bad debts to.

47:04.333 --> 47:08.324
I often went through Brett Bonar,
God rest his soul.

47:08.325 --> 47:11.620
May have been him. Although
he's really just a middleman.

47:11.645 --> 47:15.341
So where the debt ended up
and who went after him for it,

47:15.341 --> 47:17.296
I can't really tell you that.

47:17.297 --> 47:18.592
George Healy, perhaps?

47:18.617 --> 47:21.280
Well, I'd have to see
if I kept my records.

47:21.281 --> 47:23.340
Sometimes I do.
MrLong, yourevidence

47:23.365 --> 47:27.312
has been characterised
by alarming lapses of memory.

47:27.313 --> 47:30.332
Please, can you reacquaint yourself
with your financial records

47:30.333 --> 47:33.360
before we reconvene
at a date to be advised?

47:33.361 --> 47:36.316
You're excused.

47:36.317 --> 47:38.345
Yes, Commissioner.

48:06.357 --> 48:08.313
Fuck!

48:12.373 --> 48:14.369
I'll check on surveillance.
Sure.

48:15.369 --> 48:17.368
Hey, Janet. Can I have a word?

48:17.369 --> 48:19.369
Yes.

48:21.321 --> 48:23.340
After this...

48:23.341 --> 48:26.372
..I've decided
not to return to the DPP.

48:26.373 --> 48:29.308
At least, not immediately.

48:29.309 --> 48:31.284
I'll stay to the end
of the commission,

48:31.285 --> 48:33.320
however long you need me,
and I'll tell Tony tomorrow.

48:33.321 --> 48:35.288
But I wanted you to know first.

48:35.289 --> 48:36.333
Reasons?

48:38.329 --> 48:40.341
I think it's time.

48:43.325 --> 48:45.308
So what will...

48:45.309 --> 48:47.296
..what will you do?

48:47.297 --> 48:50.308
I'm gonna take the bar exam.
It'satoughjob, Richard.

48:50.309 --> 48:54.192
Theisolatednatureofthebaris...
I wasn't actually asking for advice.

48:55.337 --> 48:59.329
Ofcourse.
I'm sorry, it's just...

48:59.329 --> 49:02.284
..there's something I need to do.

49:02.285 --> 49:04.756
And who knows?
It might all end very badly.

49:04.781 --> 49:05.845
I don't think so.

49:07.297 --> 49:09.289
It's been an honour, Janet.

49:10.361 --> 49:13.364
Really, it has been.

49:13.365 --> 49:16.341
I've loved working with you.

49:17.341 --> 49:20.281
So have I, Richard.

49:21.373 --> 49:24.317
Janet,
you should check this out.

49:35.313 --> 49:37.288
Is there any movement?

49:37.289 --> 49:39.352
Still nothing.

49:39.353 --> 49:42.288
But this has just come through.

49:42.289 --> 49:44.304
Is everybody ready?
Thank you for coming.

49:44.305 --> 49:46.305
It's, um, it's with great pleasure

49:46.330 --> 49:49.284
that I announce
the Boccaro Group's proposal

49:49.285 --> 49:51.348
to build a state-of-the-art
sport and recreation centre

49:51.349 --> 49:55.296
in Western Sydney has been approved
by the municipal council.

49:55.297 --> 49:59.296
Now this visionary development
has only been made possible

49:59.297 --> 50:02.304
by your state government
agreeing to sell the Crown land

50:02.305 --> 50:04.305
on which this centre will be built

50:04.330 --> 50:06.366
for the nominal sum of one dollar.

50:07.337 --> 50:10.316
Now the long-term benefits
to the community

50:10.317 --> 50:12.356
and the state are huge.

50:12.357 --> 50:15.372
This project
will create hundreds of jobs

50:15.373 --> 50:17.356
and leave a wonderful legacy

50:17.357 --> 50:19.475
for the people
of the local community

50:19.500 --> 50:21.292
without relying on gambling.

50:21.293 --> 50:24.470
And if there's one thing
NSW does not need any more of,

50:24.495 --> 50:27.280
that's poker machines.

50:27.281 --> 50:32.312
Yes, Mr Boccaro,
your centre creates community.

50:32.313 --> 50:34.284
It doesn't destroy it.

50:34.285 --> 50:36.356
It's the sort of place
we want for our grandchildren.

50:36.357 --> 50:40.372
This is a great deal
for the people of Western Sydney.

50:40.373 --> 50:44.315
Thank you, Mr Attorney-General.
I'm just delighted I have the chance

50:44.340 --> 50:47.988
to give something back to the place
which has given me so much.

50:50.369 --> 50:52.324
You got to admire

50:52.325 --> 50:56.324
the way Lincoln Priest
always looks like the people's hero.

50:56.325 --> 50:58.345
Guy's got a real knack for it.

51:07.317 --> 51:09.316
I'm sure you'll be shocked
and surprised

51:09.317 --> 51:11.304
to hear that the Attorney-General

51:11.305 --> 51:14.325
thinks he can force me
to resign as commissioner.

51:14.325 --> 51:16.343
Except, you know,
the more I think about it,

51:16.344 --> 51:19.639
the more it strikes me
that he wouldn't go down that path

51:19.664 --> 51:21.841
unless he had a replacement lined up.

51:22.293 --> 51:23.352
Am I right?

51:23.353 --> 51:25.530
Might have been
a conversation or two.

51:25.555 --> 51:28.571
So what would it take for you to be
an ally, rather than an enemy?

51:29.353 --> 51:31.364
Janet, I've got a lot of options
on the table

51:31.365 --> 51:33.424
and this ship is sinking right now.

51:33.449 --> 51:35.429
Help us save it.

51:36.325 --> 51:38.328
Who's us?

51:38.329 --> 51:40.304
Me and Bianca.

51:40.305 --> 51:41.894
You know, if you join us...

51:41.919 --> 51:43.891
..we can do it.

51:44.357 --> 51:46.321
How?

51:59.329 --> 52:02.324
The shadow
caused by my impending appearance

52:02.325 --> 52:04.502
before
the State Corruption Commission

52:04.503 --> 52:06.550
means we are unable to fulfil
our wider brief.

52:06.551 --> 52:08.312
While I refuse to resign,

52:08.313 --> 52:10.368
I have no choice but to suspend
this royal commission

52:10.369 --> 52:13.320
until that investigation
has been completed

52:13.321 --> 52:15.364
and my future clarified
by their findings.

52:15.365 --> 52:18.320
All sessions of the commission
have been cancelled

52:18.321 --> 52:21.284
and all current operations
will cease immediately.

52:21.285 --> 52:22.344
Commissioner King?

52:22.345 --> 52:24.522
I have nothing more to add.
Thank you.

52:24.547 --> 52:26.724
Commissioner King.

52:29.349 --> 52:32.356
Along here.
Down there.

52:32.357 --> 52:35.300
Step back, please.
Away from your desk.

52:35.301 --> 52:38.317
We have to secure everything.
Move away, please.

52:41.325 --> 52:43.502
Thanks, everyone -
shut down computers

52:43.527 --> 52:45.586
and switch off your phones, please.

53:37.289 --> 53:38.332
It'son.
Camera?

53:38.333 --> 53:41.292
They're in the container now.
Who's this?

53:41.293 --> 53:42.340
Holy fuck.

53:42.341 --> 53:45.284
Of course now,
you'll never know the answer

53:45.285 --> 53:47.280
to the one murder
you most wanted to solve.

53:47.281 --> 53:49.634
For Christ's sake, Richard.
Of all cases!

53:49.659 --> 53:52.324
First principles, Janet!
First principles.

53:52.325 --> 53:54.341
DNA face morphology.

53:54.341 --> 53:56.344
How's the likeness?
Stillloading.

53:56.345 --> 53:59.372
Janet, what is it?
It's almost a photograph!

53:59.373 --> 54:01.340
Get back-up, Andy, and get there.

54:01.341 --> 54:05.341
OK, guys, I need cars at the RC and
we gotta go now! We gotta go now!
