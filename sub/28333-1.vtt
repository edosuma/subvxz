03:21.425 --> 03:22.459
Bubblegum Teddybear?

03:24.357 --> 03:25.592
Yes. Hi.

03:26.124 --> 03:28.591
I'm Jeff87. Or just Jeff is
fine.

03:36.459 --> 03:38.326
Bubblegum Teddybear.

03:41.358 --> 03:43.825
So your parents were Mr.
and Mrs. Teddybear?

03:45.126 --> 03:46.624
When my mom was in her 40s,

03:46.626 --> 03:48.593
she got her doctorate in
philosophy.

03:48.893 --> 03:50.593
Ah. So she had a few quirks.

03:51.426 --> 03:53.727
So they were Mr. and Dr.
Teddybear.

03:56.593 --> 03:58.593
Okay. Wow.

03:59.592 --> 04:01.591
I'd sure like to party with
those guys.

04:01.593 --> 04:02.660
I wish you could.

04:30.528 --> 04:31.595
Painful right?

04:34.260 --> 04:36.593
I guess you hold a certain
amount of the power

04:36.595 --> 04:37.793
when a first date is terrible

04:37.795 --> 04:39.829
because you're the one making it
terrible.

04:45.128 --> 04:47.892
I know. I'm coming off as such a
weirdo.

04:47.894 --> 04:50.095
Which is odd, because I'm not a
weirdo.

04:50.862 --> 04:52.761
I'm ridiculously unremarkable.

04:56.328 --> 04:58.062
And it's certainly not his
fault.

04:58.562 --> 04:59.393
I mean...

04:59.395 --> 05:01.559
Jeff and I should get along
great.

05:01.561 --> 05:04.095
He's also ridiculously
unremarkable.

05:07.362 --> 05:09.797
Maybe I'm not ready to be dating
again.

05:12.795 --> 05:13.826
Hey Davey?

05:13.828 --> 05:15.397
Will you show the next reel?

05:16.429 --> 05:17.431
Yeah.

05:21.129 --> 05:22.164
Uhh...

05:25.463 --> 05:27.130
Okay. Umm...

05:41.830 --> 05:43.198
Okay. So.

05:43.598 --> 05:45.596
This will all make a whole lot
more sense

05:45.598 --> 05:47.498
once you know a couple things
about me.

05:48.163 --> 05:49.831
My parents died a while ago.

05:51.397 --> 05:54.595
Oh. Poor little damaged lady.

05:54.597 --> 05:57.264
She's so messed up and
mysterious.

05:57.598 --> 05:58.595
No.

05:58.597 --> 05:59.595
I'm not.

05:59.597 --> 06:00.596
Shut up.

06:00.598 --> 06:01.832
I'm not special.

06:02.298 --> 06:03.399
Parents die.

06:03.631 --> 06:05.363
If yours haven't already, then
they're

06:05.365 --> 06:07.597
going to die soon. Just
look at how old they are.

06:07.599 --> 06:08.598
Gross.

06:09.599 --> 06:10.596
Okay.

06:10.598 --> 06:12.599
So, the other thing you
need to know about me...

06:14.198 --> 06:15.733
This is me back in Kansas.

06:18.131 --> 06:19.196
I'm waiting for a ride

06:19.198 --> 06:20.632
to my boyfriend's funeral.

06:26.565 --> 06:27.397
The funny thing is

06:27.399 --> 06:29.563
this is the strongest memory I
have

06:29.565 --> 06:31.100
of that wretched day.

06:32.166 --> 06:33.130
And I couldn't tell you why

06:33.132 --> 06:36.066
but I remember feeling in this
moment like

06:37.466 --> 06:39.167
Scarlett O'Hara.

06:45.565 --> 06:46.666
Fiddle dee dee.

06:51.333 --> 06:52.865
I'm not the type to delude
myself

06:52.867 --> 06:54.597
or fill my head with
misconceptions

06:54.599 --> 06:57.232
I'm not going to tell you
he was the perfect man

06:57.234 --> 06:58.598
or my soulmate

06:58.600 --> 07:00.101
or some such ipecac.

07:00.367 --> 07:01.732
We probably would have

07:01.734 --> 07:04.068
broken up just like everybody
does.

07:04.267 --> 07:04.765
But then he-

07:04.767 --> 07:05.568
So...

07:06.600 --> 07:07.667
Where are you from?

07:08.800 --> 07:09.801
Died.

07:10.666 --> 07:13.233
People will try to tell you that

07:13.235 --> 07:15.102
as long as you remember them,

07:15.567 --> 07:17.535
your loved ones are never really
gone.

07:18.235 --> 07:20.569
That you always have a piece
of them in your heart.

07:21.434 --> 07:22.802
Maybe that's true, but

07:23.468 --> 07:25.069
the opposite is also true.

07:30.868 --> 07:33.435
If I love someone and they die

07:33.869 --> 07:35.701
a part of me dies with them.

07:58.535 --> 07:59.537
Sup?

08:01.602 --> 08:02.602
Nuzibundin

09:42.874 --> 09:44.538
There she is.

09:44.540 --> 09:46.271
Burn the witch!

09:46.273 --> 09:47.840
Burn her!

10:19.341 --> 10:20.506
Have you seen Mickey?

10:20.508 --> 10:21.508
Sorry. I can't help.

10:21.708 --> 10:22.775
Is he in your place?

10:23.207 --> 10:24.205
Who?

10:24.207 --> 10:25.475
I don't know anyone named Nikki.

10:26.375 --> 10:27.443
Mickey.

10:29.609 --> 10:31.809
I'm sure I don't know anyone
named Mickey.

10:44.342 --> 10:46.743
Hey Davey? Will you put on the
Mickey reel?

10:47.675 --> 10:50.406
I don't have it ready to go.

10:50.408 --> 10:52.576
Can you give me a few minutes to
find it?

10:53.144 --> 10:54.108
No problem.

10:54.110 --> 10:56.474
I haven't been to Yoga since I
left Kansas.

10:56.476 --> 10:58.610
So. I'm probably due to check it
out.

11:00.344 --> 11:02.144
I've got the Yoga clip right
here.

11:03.842 --> 11:05.843
Yeah. Could you put that one on?

11:28.511 --> 11:30.445
I'm here for the 10 o'clock
class.

11:31.244 --> 11:32.344
Namaste.

11:33.245 --> 11:35.579
Have you ever taken a class with
us before?

11:36.310 --> 11:37.578
Not at this studio.

11:39.811 --> 11:42.609
Could you please fill out this
form?

11:42.611 --> 11:44.611
I have a few questions for you.

11:49.711 --> 11:52.612
Have you ever had any heart
problems?

11:54.178 --> 11:56.446
I've done Yoga lots of times.

11:58.479 --> 12:00.144
Can I ask where you're from?

12:00.146 --> 12:02.212
I can't quite place your accent.

12:03.578 --> 12:05.479
I don't have an accent.

12:06.578 --> 12:07.579
Midwest?

12:13.246 --> 12:15.511
The first class will be ten
dollars.

12:15.513 --> 12:16.580
Miss...

12:19.446 --> 12:20.580
Teddybear?

12:25.913 --> 12:28.613
We recommend that you
drink plenty of water.

12:32.914 --> 12:35.613
You forgot to fill out your
email address.

12:44.615 --> 12:48.182
No one ever recommends that
you don't drink water.

12:50.580 --> 12:51.581
Mmm-hmm.

12:55.182 --> 12:56.449
Namaste.

12:57.515 --> 12:58.749
Namaste.

12:59.447 --> 13:00.478
Alright, you dogs.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.312
Get your faces down on the mats.

13:05.449 --> 13:06.849
Keep your chin up, dipstick.

13:11.382 --> 13:13.249
Watch your balance, moron.

13:19.481 --> 13:20.579
Focus.

13:20.581 --> 13:21.582
Focus.

13:22.749 --> 13:23.817
Focus. Focus.

13:35.682 --> 13:36.683
And now

13:37.717 --> 13:39.783
we will have a few moments
of peaceful silence.

13:43.683 --> 13:45.747
Peaceful silence

13:45.749 --> 13:49.117
peaceful silence, peaceful
silence...

14:14.284 --> 14:15.285
Not now.

14:21.584 --> 14:22.582
Davey?

14:22.584 --> 14:23.718
Do you have that Mickey reel?

14:51.219 --> 14:54.586
So, your parents were Mr.
and Mrs. Teddybear?

14:55.319 --> 14:56.420
Mister and Doctor.

14:57.586 --> 14:58.587
That's great.

14:58.819 --> 14:59.820
Listen.

15:00.887 --> 15:02.154
Can I tell you something?

15:10.586 --> 15:11.587
Okay.

15:12.521 --> 15:14.651
I'm having a really nice time
with you.

15:14.653 --> 15:15.654
You're kidding.

15:16.186 --> 15:17.187
Not at all.

15:18.520 --> 15:20.687
I don't know how your last
boyfriend treated you.

15:20.921 --> 15:21.986
Dead.

15:21.988 --> 15:25.418
Or if your parents raised
you in some weird way.

15:25.420 --> 15:27.122
Also dead. Everybody's dead.

15:27.453 --> 15:29.322
But I can tell you've been hurt.

15:30.820 --> 15:33.389
Death. So much death.

15:34.587 --> 15:36.154
I'm sure you're a tough woman.

15:36.588 --> 15:37.753
But I think you're putting up

15:37.755 --> 15:39.222
an even tougher exterior.

15:40.555 --> 15:43.188
I see so much more in you.

15:44.522 --> 15:45.522
Oh no.

15:46.787 --> 15:49.155
Davey, can you get me out of
here?

15:52.755 --> 15:54.585
I think you're just...

15:54.587 --> 15:55.587
Don't.

15:55.589 --> 15:56.656
Beautiful.

16:07.588 --> 16:09.422
Ugh. He's at lunch.

16:09.822 --> 16:12.586
I said you're beautiful.

16:12.588 --> 16:14.323
Yeah. I caught that.

16:14.589 --> 16:16.157
I'm not beautiful.

16:16.823 --> 16:18.458
Sure you are.

16:18.923 --> 16:20.690
I don't want to argue about it.

16:23.589 --> 16:24.590
Sorry.

16:26.589 --> 16:29.356
Sorry I said you're beautiful.

16:34.422 --> 16:37.257
Don't ever call me beautiful.

16:40.258 --> 16:42.754
Look. Dude, I get it.

16:42.756 --> 16:44.787
You're trying to pay me a
compliment.

16:44.789 --> 16:46.424
Or whatever.

16:46.723 --> 16:48.188
You need to know

16:48.190 --> 16:49.756
that beautiful isn't something

16:49.758 --> 16:52.155
that everyone strives to be.

16:52.157 --> 16:54.723
I am actually morally opposed

16:54.725 --> 16:56.456
to being a human being who

16:56.458 --> 16:58.192
radiates beauty outwardly.

16:58.658 --> 17:00.425
That makes no sense.

17:00.691 --> 17:01.789
Every morning

17:01.791 --> 17:03.588
I look in the mirror and I say,

17:03.590 --> 17:06.323
'You are not beautiful.
You are not beautiful.'

17:06.325 --> 17:07.256
It's my mantra.

17:07.258 --> 17:09.825
Sometimes, it's the high point
of my day.

17:12.590 --> 17:15.358
You want me to tell you
that you're not beautiful?

17:23.526 --> 17:24.589
Do you want me to tell you

17:24.592 --> 17:25.656
that you're not beautiful?

17:25.659 --> 17:26.756
Bubblegum?

17:26.758 --> 17:28.455
Everything okay?

17:28.458 --> 17:30.589
I'm fine. He called me
beautiful.

17:30.591 --> 17:31.656
Uh oh.

17:31.658 --> 17:32.659
Well?

17:33.492 --> 17:34.493
Well what?

17:34.826 --> 17:36.591
Do you want me to tell you

17:36.593 --> 17:38.360
that you're not beautiful?

17:38.627 --> 17:41.427
I don't want you to tell me
anything.

17:44.759 --> 17:45.760
You saw that?

17:46.660 --> 17:47.591
You don't know what
you're doing here

17:47.593 --> 17:48.593
but I do.

17:49.392 --> 17:50.290
You're here

17:50.292 --> 17:52.694
because you're grasping at
connection.

17:53.360 --> 17:54.293
You need to know

17:54.295 --> 17:56.593
that other spirits are haunting
this land.

17:57.592 --> 17:58.594
We're all around you.

18:00.593 --> 18:01.727
Just reach out.

18:03.894 --> 18:06.594
I just want you to give it a
chance.

18:07.593 --> 18:08.594
Nice!

18:09.694 --> 18:11.228
Shut up, Davey.

18:13.827 --> 18:15.394
I know why I'm here.

18:17.427 --> 18:19.591
I'm here with you because
there were technical

18:19.593 --> 18:21.262
problems with the Mickey reel.

18:22.661 --> 18:24.262
You're not giving it a chance.

18:25.861 --> 18:27.129
I don't know if I can.

18:27.594 --> 18:28.595
Huh?

18:30.829 --> 18:33.596
You probably are an interesting
guy.

18:34.261 --> 18:35.395
I don't know.

18:36.528 --> 18:38.862
But I haven't said one normal
thing this whole time.

18:39.294 --> 18:40.595
You just sit there. You know?

18:41.729 --> 18:43.397
It's hard to respect it.

18:44.195 --> 18:46.361
I wish you would just get up and
leave.

18:46.363 --> 18:48.226
And go. And find a girl who
wants

18:48.228 --> 18:49.362
to be called beautiful.

18:49.595 --> 18:50.763
Go and be happy.

18:51.763 --> 18:53.463
I could respect that.

19:13.364 --> 19:14.261
I had this friend

19:14.263 --> 19:15.796
back in Kansas who
was a photographer.

19:16.264 --> 19:19.098
She knew all about soft
lights and soft focus.

19:19.730 --> 19:21.328
She would take pictures

19:21.330 --> 19:23.330
of fat people and make them look
thinner.

19:23.797 --> 19:25.495
She'd make people look younger.

19:25.497 --> 19:27.594
She hid aspects of their
appearance.

19:27.596 --> 19:29.395
And emphasized others.

19:29.397 --> 19:31.598
She made people look beautiful.

19:36.831 --> 19:39.265
I am this and I never want to be
beautiful.

19:39.731 --> 19:42.399
I especially never want
to be made beautiful.

20:44.334 --> 20:46.102
I had a nice time with you
tonight, Buffy.

20:46.767 --> 20:48.134
Me too, Biff.

20:51.666 --> 20:53.469
Is it okay if we park here?

20:54.433 --> 20:55.431
For a while?

20:55.433 --> 20:57.599
I mean, it's okay if you
need to go home or...

20:57.601 --> 20:58.565
Oh.

20:58.567 --> 20:59.568
Anything or...

21:00.434 --> 21:01.669
If you want.

21:13.402 --> 21:14.598
You look really pretty tonight.

21:14.600 --> 21:15.602
What was that?

21:17.602 --> 21:18.401
I'm sorry.

21:19.601 --> 21:21.436
I think there are coyotes out
there.

21:29.468 --> 21:31.204
There's no coyotes around here.

21:45.537 --> 21:46.604
Bubblegum.

21:47.603 --> 21:48.603
Yes?

21:48.937 --> 21:50.534
I have the Mickey reel.

21:50.536 --> 21:51.600
I'm sleeping.

21:51.602 --> 21:52.603
Wake up.

21:57.769 --> 21:59.734
I just had the strangest dream.

21:59.736 --> 22:00.803
What happened?

22:01.703 --> 22:03.371
I never remember my dreams...

22:04.604 --> 22:06.635
...something about seatbelts?

22:06.637 --> 22:09.604
So? Do you want me to run this?

22:15.371 --> 22:16.839
Yeah. Go ahead.

22:51.605 --> 22:52.606
So.

22:53.872 --> 22:55.607
Bubblegum Teddybear.

22:59.206 --> 23:01.303
My name is Bubblegum Teddybear.

23:01.305 --> 23:02.474
Everyone is dead.

23:02.673 --> 23:04.504
I'm from Kansas but I don't like

23:04.506 --> 23:05.571
people to know that because

23:05.573 --> 23:07.271
it irritates me when someone
says

23:07.273 --> 23:08.803
I don't think we're there
anymore.

23:08.805 --> 23:11.237
I'm not beautiful because beauty
is a thing

23:11.239 --> 23:13.606
that should be taken in, not
projected out.

23:19.306 --> 23:21.140
Do you want to go see a rock and
roll show?

23:29.908 --> 23:32.608
These guys are friends of yours?

23:33.607 --> 23:35.508
The guy is my neighbor.

23:36.275 --> 23:38.442
The... singer?

23:40.541 --> 23:42.375
I have no idea.

23:58.608 --> 23:59.609
Huh.

24:01.208 --> 24:03.209
He doesn't know I'm alive.

24:09.708 --> 24:11.609
I think I'm gonna go.

24:18.942 --> 24:20.607
This is the greatest thing

24:20.609 --> 24:22.609
I've ever seen in my life.

25:48.712 --> 25:50.511
We are Mickey and the Slippers.
Thank you.

25:50.513 --> 25:52.247
Thank you. Good night.

25:58.880 --> 25:59.880
Hi.

26:00.580 --> 26:02.311
You guys were awesome.

26:02.313 --> 26:03.478
That was so much fun.

26:03.480 --> 26:04.481
I'm your neighbor.

26:05.712 --> 26:06.745
Hi.

26:06.747 --> 26:07.747
I'm Mickey.

26:08.447 --> 26:09.512
I know.

26:09.514 --> 26:11.546
I've been waiting for
this reel my whole movie.

26:11.548 --> 26:12.848
I'm Bubblegum Teddybear.

26:13.748 --> 26:14.748
Of course you are.

26:15.880 --> 26:16.882
This is Ingrid.

26:17.346 --> 26:18.781
I'm a performance artist.

26:19.480 --> 26:20.481
This is Babette.

26:21.380 --> 26:22.614
I'm a prop.

26:24.614 --> 26:25.615
Bubblegum.

26:26.447 --> 26:27.448
Bubblegum.

26:28.680 --> 26:30.149
You wanna go to a party?

26:34.347 --> 26:36.482
Davey, that's way too far ahead!

26:37.847 --> 26:39.181
Sorry.

26:44.581 --> 26:45.582
That's better.

26:46.781 --> 26:47.782
You wanna go to a party?

26:48.481 --> 26:49.612
Umm...

26:49.614 --> 26:51.313
I don't think I should.

26:51.315 --> 26:52.313
Why not?

26:52.315 --> 26:53.813
I'm terrified.

26:53.815 --> 26:55.350
Give it time.

26:55.615 --> 26:56.712
Hey Bubblegum.

26:56.714 --> 26:57.715
Watch this.

27:05.449 --> 27:06.450
How?

27:08.516 --> 27:09.617
Nice to meet you Bubblegum.

27:20.949 --> 27:22.447
You know how every time you love

27:22.449 --> 27:23.584
someone, they die?

27:23.849 --> 27:25.585
Mickey changed everything.

27:28.584 --> 27:29.849
And before you get ahead of
me...

27:29.851 --> 27:31.518
Mickey and I don't fall in love.

27:34.184 --> 27:35.183
I promise.

27:38.683 --> 27:40.251
Is that him at the door?

27:41.217 --> 27:42.218
Mickey.

27:43.118 --> 27:44.182
He's the guy who made life
interesting

27:44.184 --> 27:45.617
and my dreams boring.

27:46.851 --> 27:49.486
I'm actually dreaming right now.

28:22.552 --> 28:24.416
You're not beautiful. You're not
beautiful.

28:24.418 --> 28:25.452
You're not beautiful.

28:43.753 --> 28:44.753
It's 11:30.

28:46.787 --> 28:47.817
Barry?

28:47.819 --> 28:49.286
What are you doing here?

28:50.954 --> 28:52.155
Gary.

28:55.586 --> 28:57.485
I shouldn't have to have
to walk away from you

28:57.487 --> 28:58.584
to earn your respect.

28:58.586 --> 28:59.618
I was polite to you.

28:59.620 --> 29:00.618
And nice.

29:00.620 --> 29:02.222
I was even pretty charming.

29:03.320 --> 29:05.288
Everybody's nervous on a first
date.

29:05.620 --> 29:06.420
What do you want from me?

29:07.787 --> 29:09.455
Do you know how to use a French
press?

29:11.187 --> 29:12.286
Yeah.

29:12.288 --> 29:13.288
Prove it.

29:13.954 --> 29:15.318
I'll be right back.

29:15.320 --> 29:16.754
I'm going to go get cleaned up a
bit.

29:26.489 --> 29:27.889
I think you owe me an apology.

29:34.722 --> 29:35.722
Do you mind?

29:37.655 --> 29:39.453
The guy who shows up at my house

29:39.455 --> 29:41.453
uninvited and wakes me up,

29:41.455 --> 29:43.619
is worried about drinking
some of the coffee

29:43.621 --> 29:45.420
he made for me.

29:45.422 --> 29:47.620
You see? That right there.

29:47.622 --> 29:49.457
You are so rude to me.

29:50.189 --> 29:51.253
I can't stop thinking about

29:51.255 --> 29:52.623
how impolite you are.

29:52.856 --> 29:54.856
I don't deserve to be treated
like this.

29:58.623 --> 29:59.623
I...

30:02.590 --> 30:04.424
I need to get into the arts.

30:05.289 --> 30:06.590
I want to be an artist.

30:07.323 --> 30:08.325
Do you paint?

30:08.590 --> 30:09.588
No.

30:09.590 --> 30:10.591
Can you draw?

30:10.957 --> 30:12.158
Not really.

30:13.723 --> 30:15.723
What kind of artist are you
going to be?

30:25.356 --> 30:26.357
I'm...

30:27.857 --> 30:28.858
I'm sorry.

30:30.323 --> 30:31.324
I was rude to you.

30:35.891 --> 30:37.456
I wanna be a rock and roll

30:37.458 --> 30:39.621
performance artist kind of
artist.

30:39.623 --> 30:40.622
Go to Amsterdam.

30:40.624 --> 30:41.625
Have a fun life.

30:42.524 --> 30:44.425
I have a cousin that went to
Amsterdam.

30:44.759 --> 30:47.590
Everyone has a cousin
who went to Amsterdam.

30:47.592 --> 30:49.359
I want to be the cousin.

31:17.625 --> 31:18.658
Boyfriend?

31:18.660 --> 31:19.660
No.

31:20.227 --> 31:21.227
Gary.

31:26.426 --> 31:27.427
Bye.

31:29.593 --> 31:30.591
Hey.

31:30.593 --> 31:31.594
What are you doing?

31:32.960 --> 31:34.161
Nothing.

31:34.594 --> 31:35.595
Going out.

31:36.426 --> 31:37.427
Wanna come?

31:47.893 --> 31:49.461
So tell me about yourself.

31:50.627 --> 31:53.259
I...

31:53.261 --> 31:55.429
...can move things with my mind.

31:57.627 --> 31:58.625
What's the biggest thing

31:58.627 --> 31:59.628
you ever tried to move?

32:01.195 --> 32:02.629
South America.

32:03.261 --> 32:04.625
I tried to make it West America,

32:04.627 --> 32:06.596
but the thing wouldn't budge.

32:07.827 --> 32:08.627
Pity.

32:11.329 --> 32:13.596
I can also start fires with my
mind.

32:20.396 --> 32:22.196
I bet that comes in handy.

32:30.963 --> 32:32.164
So...

32:34.695 --> 32:35.696
So.

32:38.629 --> 32:40.497
So tell me about you.

32:48.296 --> 32:49.594
How is it?

32:49.596 --> 32:50.597
It's perfect.

32:52.597 --> 32:54.598
I collect astronaut trading
cards.

32:55.597 --> 32:56.594
Sounds fulfilling.

32:56.596 --> 32:57.597
It's a passion.

32:58.596 --> 32:59.597
In my life.

33:01.429 --> 33:03.364
Okay, now tell me something
true.

33:07.463 --> 33:09.595
I thought hanging out with you
would be fun

33:09.597 --> 33:10.664
Turns out, it's not.

33:14.431 --> 33:15.599
Not that true!

33:16.498 --> 33:18.396
I'm sorry. That was really rude
of me.

33:18.398 --> 33:19.629
I don't know where that came
from.

33:19.631 --> 33:20.629
That was perfect.

33:20.631 --> 33:22.132
No really. I'm sorry.

33:22.497 --> 33:23.798
I don't know where that came
from.

33:29.598 --> 33:30.599
Let's start over.

33:32.532 --> 33:33.599
Absolutely.

33:36.897 --> 33:38.599
So, what do you do?

33:39.731 --> 33:41.466
My parents were well off.

33:41.666 --> 33:43.733
When they died, everything
they had became mine.

33:45.199 --> 33:46.697
I don't know what's going to
happen

33:46.699 --> 33:47.729
when I die.

33:47.731 --> 33:48.732
I don't have a will.

33:49.798 --> 33:51.565
I don't do anything.

33:52.933 --> 33:55.334
I thought I wanted to work with
animals.

33:56.633 --> 34:00.634
What would you say is
your greatest strength?

34:04.332 --> 34:05.633
I'm a hard worker.

34:06.266 --> 34:07.631
I work well individully

34:07.633 --> 34:08.632
or in a group.

34:19.666 --> 34:23.766
And what would you say is
your greatest weakness?

34:25.433 --> 34:26.833
I have a violent temper.

34:28.600 --> 34:30.598
Will you tell me about a time
when you

34:30.600 --> 34:32.599
had a lot of stress at work

34:32.601 --> 34:34.599
and what did you do to manage

34:34.601 --> 34:35.601
the sitution?

34:37.600 --> 34:39.900
I've never known how to
answer that question.

34:40.601 --> 34:41.701
No one does, right?

34:48.635 --> 34:51.632
One time, it was somebody's
birthday

34:51.634 --> 34:52.601
and there was a cake.

34:52.936 --> 34:54.768
But I didn't want any cake.

34:56.202 --> 34:57.599
Everyone kept asking me

34:57.601 --> 34:59.599
why didn't I want any cake

34:59.601 --> 35:01.600
and was I sure I didn't want any
cake.

35:01.602 --> 35:03.600
And, "Shouldn't you be having
some cake?"

35:03.602 --> 35:05.803
"Why don't you want any cake?"

35:07.734 --> 35:09.603
I ate a piece of cake.

35:14.402 --> 35:15.604
I'm dying.

35:16.635 --> 35:19.636
I can't seem to place your
accent.

35:21.368 --> 35:23.469
I don't have an accent.

35:23.703 --> 35:25.603
They were in a car
accident.

35:25.936 --> 35:27.633
We were together for two
years.

35:27.635 --> 35:29.637
I've never stopped loving her.

35:30.636 --> 35:32.637
I hope she'll show up
again one of these days.

35:32.969 --> 35:35.601
But I also hope she doesn't show
up here.

35:35.603 --> 35:36.403
You know?

35:37.737 --> 35:39.738
He just stopped
breathing.

35:49.603 --> 35:50.604
Bubblegum?

35:53.603 --> 35:54.404
Bubblegum!

35:57.504 --> 35:59.605
Give me a few more minutes to be
alive.

36:00.604 --> 36:01.603
What is that?

36:01.605 --> 36:02.602
Nothing.

36:02.604 --> 36:03.603
It's Davey.

36:03.605 --> 36:05.606
He's trying to change the scene.

36:06.604 --> 36:08.471
You can hear Davey?

36:10.471 --> 36:11.635
Yeah. I can see him too.

36:11.637 --> 36:13.635
He's that guy up there in the
booth.

36:13.637 --> 36:14.738
What's he doing up there?

36:15.437 --> 36:16.605
He's a metaphor.

36:17.404 --> 36:18.602
What do you want, Davey?

36:18.604 --> 36:20.602
I have the Ingrid reel.

36:20.604 --> 36:21.603
Oh.

36:21.605 --> 36:23.604
Okay, I like this one.

36:23.606 --> 36:24.607
Go ahead.

36:26.438 --> 36:27.439
Wait.

36:27.804 --> 36:29.572
Is he, like,

36:30.305 --> 36:31.640
watching me all the time?

36:33.272 --> 36:34.606
Get your own metaphor.

36:49.373 --> 36:51.173
Hey Bubblegum, can I talk you
for a minute?

36:51.606 --> 36:52.607
Uh.

36:53.240 --> 36:54.241
Sure.

36:56.840 --> 36:57.841
Hey.

36:58.539 --> 36:59.605
There's nothing between me

36:59.607 --> 37:00.908
and Mickey. I was just...

37:01.607 --> 37:03.605
I don't know what I was doing.

37:03.607 --> 37:04.874
Oh. Yeah. I know.

37:05.307 --> 37:06.605
There's nothing going on

37:06.607 --> 37:07.604
between me and Mickey either.

37:07.606 --> 37:08.605
Really?

37:08.607 --> 37:09.572
Yeah.

37:09.574 --> 37:11.604
He's still in love with that
mystery woman

37:11.606 --> 37:12.606
from the other side
of the proverbial

37:12.608 --> 37:13.605
train line.

37:13.607 --> 37:14.705
Line?

37:14.707 --> 37:15.708
Uh. Who is she?

37:16.274 --> 37:17.275
Huh?

37:17.740 --> 37:19.742
Oh. Right. My line.

37:21.541 --> 37:22.605
Who is she?

37:22.607 --> 37:23.606
Listen.

37:23.608 --> 37:25.506
I got a chance to go back home

37:25.508 --> 37:27.605
and haunt some old friends in
New York.

37:27.607 --> 37:29.672
It's to good for me to pass up.

37:29.674 --> 37:30.675
You're leaving?

37:31.309 --> 37:32.309
It's up to you.

37:34.208 --> 37:35.608
I don't want to mess up the
band.

37:36.741 --> 37:38.742
I want you to replace me.

37:39.576 --> 37:41.373
I can't do what you do.

37:41.375 --> 37:42.175
It's easy.

37:42.608 --> 37:44.607
All you have to do is become a
magnet

37:44.609 --> 37:46.272
for all of creation's beauty

37:46.274 --> 37:47.606
and for all that is grotesque.

37:47.608 --> 37:48.739
You reflect this to everyone

37:48.741 --> 37:50.609
as the music dictates.

37:51.309 --> 37:52.309
Ah.

37:52.576 --> 37:53.576
I'll show you.

38:28.777 --> 38:30.678
Are you allergic to flour?

38:31.610 --> 38:32.611
I don't know.

38:32.910 --> 38:33.912
You would know.

39:37.846 --> 39:39.281
How do I look?

39:41.913 --> 39:43.680
I think you need a little
eyeliner.

39:45.379 --> 39:46.378
You're not beautiful.

39:46.380 --> 39:48.148
You're not beautiful.
You're not beautiful.

39:48.614 --> 39:49.815
You're grotesque.

40:05.614 --> 40:06.615
Hi?

40:07.248 --> 40:08.613
Hi. It's me.

40:08.615 --> 40:09.615
Bubblegum?

40:09.948 --> 40:11.613
What are you doing in there?

40:11.615 --> 40:13.616
Come. See. My band.

40:15.381 --> 40:16.612
You learned music?

40:16.614 --> 40:17.615
YOU LEARNED MUSIC?

40:21.614 --> 40:22.479
What?

40:22.481 --> 40:24.613
I'm supposed to invite everyone
I know

40:24.615 --> 40:25.616
but I don't know anyone.

40:27.581 --> 40:29.582
7 o'clock. Tonight.

40:29.914 --> 40:32.414
Okay. Okay.

40:32.416 --> 40:33.480
Wouldn't you rather

40:33.482 --> 40:35.315
come over on this side with me?

40:45.749 --> 40:47.415
Check this out.

41:56.384 --> 41:57.383
Dude.

41:57.385 --> 41:58.686
That was so much fun.

41:59.852 --> 42:01.453
It was a very good night.

42:02.286 --> 42:03.983
When we did Photocopy Love
Notes,

42:03.985 --> 42:05.849
I completely forgot the
choreography.

42:05.851 --> 42:07.618
And I tried to look at Babbette
and

42:07.620 --> 42:08.617
the light was shining in my
eyes.

42:08.619 --> 42:09.618
I couldn't see a thing.

42:09.620 --> 42:10.617
I just had to wing it.

42:10.619 --> 42:11.618
And so at the end of the song

42:11.620 --> 42:12.886
the whole audience cheered.

42:13.620 --> 42:14.618
Cheered.

42:14.620 --> 42:15.621
We were rock stars.

42:16.886 --> 42:18.785
It was rad.

42:18.787 --> 42:20.786
It was heaven.

42:22.953 --> 42:24.520
It's a fine line

42:25.620 --> 42:26.617
A what?

42:26.619 --> 42:27.850
A fine line.

42:27.852 --> 42:29.720
Between rad and heaven.

42:30.619 --> 42:31.586
Line?

42:31.588 --> 42:32.588
Where is Babette?

42:33.220 --> 42:34.221
Huh?

42:34.587 --> 42:35.588
Oh.

42:36.353 --> 42:37.587
Thanks Davey.

42:37.787 --> 42:38.788
Where is Babette?

42:40.220 --> 42:41.219
I don't know.

42:41.221 --> 42:42.355
She left with that guy.

42:43.721 --> 42:44.722
What guy?

42:45.621 --> 42:46.618
That guy.

42:46.620 --> 42:47.621
At the show?

42:48.288 --> 42:49.288
Which one?

42:50.520 --> 42:51.321
I don't know.

42:51.921 --> 42:53.922
He came by himself and left with
Babette.

42:57.355 --> 42:59.623
Davey, can you show my
insecurity?

43:02.621 --> 43:04.353
So, Babette.

43:04.355 --> 43:05.620
That's an unusual name.

43:05.622 --> 43:06.623
Is it French?

43:08.755 --> 43:09.756
Oui.

43:11.721 --> 43:12.856
Tell me about your parents.

43:13.554 --> 43:14.886
They're still totally alive.

43:14.888 --> 43:16.587
And they love me so much.

43:16.589 --> 43:18.457
I can call them any time I want.

43:20.888 --> 43:22.489
You're so beautiful.

43:23.255 --> 43:24.620
I really am.

43:24.622 --> 43:25.623
It's the best.

43:28.223 --> 43:30.757
And I am still so in my
twenties.

43:32.623 --> 43:34.454
Beautiful and young.

43:34.456 --> 43:36.320
And I am totally going through

43:36.322 --> 43:37.624
a hussy phase right now.

43:47.989 --> 43:49.622
What are you doing?

43:49.624 --> 43:50.689
I'm practicing.

43:50.691 --> 43:51.589
If I'm ever in a movie

43:51.591 --> 43:53.625
and I need to wake up from a
nightmare.

43:57.757 --> 43:59.458
That was fun.

44:01.791 --> 44:02.788
Do you think Babette is

44:02.790 --> 44:03.791
prettier than me?

44:04.656 --> 44:05.721
Oh yeah.

44:05.723 --> 44:07.790
She's much, much prettier than
you.

44:09.756 --> 44:10.757
I see.

44:11.624 --> 44:12.921
I don't mean that in a bad way.

44:12.923 --> 44:14.623
I mean, you're pretty...

44:14.625 --> 44:16.626
in an ex-girlfriend kind of a
way.

44:18.692 --> 44:20.559
What way is that?

44:21.857 --> 44:23.556
You know when you're dating a
woman

44:23.558 --> 44:24.622
and you think she's

44:24.624 --> 44:25.456
the prettiest woman in the world

44:25.458 --> 44:26.422
and you want to kiss her and
kiss her

44:26.424 --> 44:28.625
and want to kiss her a million
more times?

44:29.624 --> 44:30.855
And then you break up with her

44:30.857 --> 44:32.625
and you never want to kiss her
again.

44:33.624 --> 44:35.623
But isn't she as pretty

44:35.625 --> 44:36.656
as she ever was?

44:36.658 --> 44:37.690
Yes. Exactly.

44:37.692 --> 44:38.524
Super pretty.

44:38.526 --> 44:40.692
In an all-kissed-out kind of a
way.

44:41.358 --> 44:42.592
And that's you.

44:42.859 --> 44:43.860
Super pretty.

44:45.792 --> 44:48.592
But boys don't want to kiss me.

44:49.625 --> 44:50.624
No.

44:50.626 --> 44:51.627
Some of them do.

44:52.626 --> 44:54.624
All of them want to kiss
Babette.

44:54.626 --> 44:55.627
I mean...

44:57.626 --> 44:58.627
Look at her.

45:00.427 --> 45:02.628
Say something nice to me.

45:08.227 --> 45:09.628
You're a rock star.

45:17.526 --> 45:18.527
Hell yeah.

45:32.628 --> 45:33.629
Hey Bubblegum.

45:33.828 --> 45:34.829
Come on in.

45:36.428 --> 45:37.793
Yeah. I called him.

45:37.795 --> 45:38.795
So what?

45:50.361 --> 45:51.893
I was just going to make some
coffee.

45:51.895 --> 45:52.896
Do you want some?

45:53.394 --> 45:54.729
Do you have anything stronger?

45:55.861 --> 45:56.862
Sure.

46:16.495 --> 46:18.560
Did you have a nice time last
night?

46:18.562 --> 46:19.628
Oh yeah.

46:19.630 --> 46:20.627
I meant to tell you.

46:20.629 --> 46:21.628
You guys were great.

46:21.630 --> 46:22.627
Really, really fun.

46:22.629 --> 46:24.628
I still can't dance though.

46:24.630 --> 46:25.627
Yeah.

46:25.629 --> 46:26.628
Thanks.

46:26.630 --> 46:27.631
It was fun.

46:31.231 --> 46:33.398
I didn't see you after the show.

46:33.730 --> 46:34.727
I didn't think I was

46:34.729 --> 46:35.730
invited to the party.

46:36.796 --> 46:37.797
What party?

46:38.696 --> 46:40.632
Isn't there always a party
afterwards?

46:41.297 --> 46:42.298
Barely.

46:43.598 --> 46:44.598
So what did you do?

46:45.264 --> 46:46.265
Came home.

46:47.597 --> 46:48.598
By yourself?

46:50.663 --> 46:51.664
You're jealous.

46:52.598 --> 46:53.598
I'm not.

46:54.598 --> 46:55.462
Who is it?

46:55.464 --> 46:56.596
Who is the girl that makes you
jealous?

46:56.598 --> 46:57.596
I'm not jealous.

46:57.598 --> 46:58.464
Tell me...

46:58.466 --> 47:00.632
and I'll tell you if she's still
here.

47:01.631 --> 47:03.629
I'm not jealous of any woman.

47:03.631 --> 47:05.633
Especially one with a fake
French name.

47:06.632 --> 47:07.629
Yeah.

47:07.631 --> 47:08.563
You of all people

47:08.565 --> 47:10.632
should totally make fun of
people's names,

47:10.932 --> 47:12.633
Bubblegum Teddybear.

47:15.398 --> 47:16.399
Is she here?

47:16.932 --> 47:17.963
Who?

47:17.965 --> 47:19.167
Babette.

47:21.232 --> 47:22.233
Bubblegum.

47:22.632 --> 47:23.866
Look at me.
No.

47:26.600 --> 47:29.597
I have never known anyone named
Babette.

47:29.599 --> 47:31.597
I came home alone last night.

47:31.599 --> 47:33.396
You and I are in the middle

47:33.398 --> 47:35.464
of an incredibly passionate love
affair.

47:35.466 --> 47:36.898
I've known about it for some
time.

47:36.900 --> 47:38.834
But you've only realized it
recently.

47:48.633 --> 47:49.834
Love is stupid.

47:58.734 --> 47:59.735
Try this:

48:12.268 --> 48:13.699
I can't do that.

48:13.701 --> 48:14.835
No one can.

48:15.300 --> 48:16.334
Try.

48:19.602 --> 48:20.602
No.

48:21.401 --> 48:22.401
Like this:

48:29.635 --> 48:31.636
I tried. I can't.

48:32.567 --> 48:33.600
Please.

48:33.602 --> 48:35.369
It's important to me. Try again.

48:40.236 --> 48:41.236
You did it.

48:42.703 --> 48:43.799
I thought you don't like

48:43.801 --> 48:45.399
being called beautiful.

48:45.401 --> 48:46.402
I don't.

48:56.970 --> 48:59.171
I shouldn't have had all that
coffee.

48:59.802 --> 49:00.801
Hang on.

49:00.803 --> 49:01.803
I'm coming out.

49:08.636 --> 49:10.437
Well, this just won't do.

49:12.937 --> 49:14.634
I've read all the books.

49:14.636 --> 49:16.637
I've seen all the movies.

49:17.003 --> 49:18.770
I know about structure.

49:30.604 --> 49:32.604
This was my life.

49:32.837 --> 49:34.604
This is my movie.

49:34.971 --> 49:36.769
I don't want it to be some...

49:36.771 --> 49:37.570
Tragedy.

49:39.938 --> 49:41.869
Things are starting to go well
for me.

49:41.871 --> 49:43.602
And they're only going to keep
getting

49:43.604 --> 49:44.603
better and better

49:44.605 --> 49:45.602
until the very end

49:45.604 --> 49:47.604
and then, POOF!

49:47.870 --> 49:49.602
Death and misery.

49:49.604 --> 49:50.604
Well, I won't have it.

49:52.404 --> 49:53.405
Davey?

49:54.239 --> 49:55.239
Yeah?

49:56.639 --> 49:57.636
What else have you got

49:57.638 --> 49:58.639
ready to go up there?

49:59.504 --> 50:00.503
I don't know.

50:00.505 --> 50:01.636
Um.

50:01.638 --> 50:02.639
A bunch of stuff.

50:03.005 --> 50:04.569
What do you want?

50:04.571 --> 50:06.403
Pain and misery.

50:06.405 --> 50:08.636
I want everything to wrong

50:08.638 --> 50:10.304
and be awful

50:10.306 --> 50:11.604
until the very end.

50:11.606 --> 50:12.603
And then, POOF!

50:12.605 --> 50:13.604
I'm Cinderella.

50:13.606 --> 50:15.604
Okay. Ummm.

50:15.606 --> 50:16.603
I've got...

50:16.605 --> 50:18.605
Bubblegum and Gary...

50:18.607 --> 50:19.438
fall in love.

50:19.440 --> 50:21.338
That's exactly what I don't
want.

50:21.340 --> 50:22.605
In fact, destroy it.

50:22.607 --> 50:23.604
Okay, there's...

50:23.606 --> 50:25.604
Bubblegum Looks in the Mirror,

50:25.606 --> 50:27.604
Macaroni and Cheese,

50:27.606 --> 50:29.605
Bubblegum Goes to the Store,

50:29.607 --> 50:31.705
Bubblegum Finds Money,...

50:31.707 --> 50:33.208
Those all sound boring.

50:33.607 --> 50:36.175
Uh... Bubblegum and Gary Don't
Kiss...

50:37.341 --> 50:38.538
Yes.

50:38.540 --> 50:39.637
What's that one?

50:39.639 --> 50:40.806
Put that one on.

50:45.306 --> 50:46.508
I hate this.

50:47.773 --> 50:48.940
Just watch.

50:50.640 --> 50:51.972
Are you sure we don't kiss?

50:51.974 --> 50:53.608
It looks like we're about to
kiss.

50:53.840 --> 50:55.841
I want to kiss you Bubblegum.

50:56.940 --> 50:57.941
Barf.

50:59.841 --> 51:00.842
No.

51:01.707 --> 51:02.708
Yay.

51:06.507 --> 51:07.608
What's the problem?

51:20.774 --> 51:22.475
You annoy me.

51:25.642 --> 51:26.507
That's because

51:26.509 --> 51:28.639
you don't know how irritating
you are.

51:28.641 --> 51:30.639
You are far, far more annoying

51:30.641 --> 51:31.642
than I am.

51:43.408 --> 51:44.441
No, no, no.

51:44.443 --> 51:45.610
Stop this.

51:46.609 --> 51:47.608
See?

51:47.610 --> 51:49.608
You don't kiss.

51:49.610 --> 51:51.608
That was way worse.

51:51.610 --> 51:52.607
That was exactly the wrong

51:52.609 --> 51:53.608
kind of awful.

51:53.610 --> 51:55.541
What else to you have up there?

51:55.543 --> 51:56.609
Okay.

51:56.611 --> 51:57.611
There's um...

51:58.611 --> 52:00.442
Bubblegum Makes Peace With the

52:00.444 --> 52:02.007
Demons of Her Past,

52:02.009 --> 52:03.644
Citizen Kane,...

52:03.910 --> 52:05.475
Citizen Kane?

52:05.477 --> 52:06.507
Yeah.

52:06.509 --> 52:07.508
Oops.

52:07.510 --> 52:09.642
Uh... That's mine.

52:09.644 --> 52:11.645
Everyone says I should watch it.

52:11.877 --> 52:12.908
Ugh.

52:12.910 --> 52:14.975
All of these end badly for me.

52:14.977 --> 52:17.276
Is Citizen Kane in public
domain?

52:17.278 --> 52:18.279
Nope.

52:18.611 --> 52:19.608
Fine.

52:19.610 --> 52:20.844
Put on Mac and Cheese.

52:25.612 --> 52:27.476
That's my place back in Kansas.

52:27.478 --> 52:28.479
I know.

52:31.778 --> 52:33.443
This is boring.

52:33.445 --> 52:34.445
I know.

52:39.812 --> 52:40.778
Oh wow.

52:41.712 --> 52:42.712
That's it.

52:44.644 --> 52:46.543
I never had strong opinions
about

52:46.545 --> 52:47.913
macaroni and cheese.

52:49.546 --> 52:51.547
But he loved the stuff.

52:52.278 --> 52:53.509
I wanted to make

52:53.511 --> 52:55.812
some for him when he got back
home.

52:57.512 --> 52:58.513
But.

53:00.613 --> 53:02.612
He never came back home.

53:06.280 --> 53:07.281
Bubblegum?

53:10.746 --> 53:11.747
I just...

53:14.279 --> 53:15.611
I just have to get out of here

53:15.613 --> 53:16.614
for a little while.

53:32.014 --> 53:32.946
You're not beautiful.

53:32.948 --> 53:35.814
You're not beautiful. You're not
beautiful.

54:29.616 --> 54:30.615
Mickey?

54:30.617 --> 54:31.614
Bubblegum?

54:31.616 --> 54:32.617
I'm in here.

54:37.750 --> 54:39.416
What are you doing?

54:40.616 --> 54:41.617
Lydia's here.

54:42.016 --> 54:43.218
Not here, here.

54:43.617 --> 54:44.614
But here.

54:44.616 --> 54:45.617
Lydia?

54:45.983 --> 54:47.185
The one?

54:47.617 --> 54:48.618
The one.

54:49.850 --> 54:52.248
So you're, um, getting ready for
her?

54:52.250 --> 54:53.617
Having a little bath?

54:59.584 --> 55:00.652
What are you doing here?

55:07.352 --> 55:08.452
I got scared.

55:10.485 --> 55:11.486
Where's Gary?

55:12.817 --> 55:13.818
You know Gary?

55:14.517 --> 55:15.685
How long was I gone?

55:17.917 --> 55:19.483
Best advice:

55:19.485 --> 55:20.486
Find him.

55:23.251 --> 55:25.617
I don't want any. Love.

55:25.619 --> 55:26.483
Can't I just...

55:26.485 --> 55:28.619
...avoid him until Lydia gets
here?

55:31.618 --> 55:32.818
She's behind you.

55:37.519 --> 55:38.516
Bubblegum, Lydia...

55:38.518 --> 55:39.519
...Lydia, Bubblegum.

55:41.985 --> 55:44.517
You are the most beautiful thing

55:44.519 --> 55:46.017
I have ever seen

55:46.019 --> 55:47.853
in heaven or on Earth.

55:48.620 --> 55:49.787
Hello Bubblegum.

55:49.987 --> 55:52.188
I can't place your accent.

55:52.786 --> 55:54.587
I don't have an accent.

55:55.919 --> 55:57.720
Of course not.

55:58.354 --> 56:00.018
I'm sorry. I don't mean to
disrupt your

56:00.020 --> 56:01.221
throughline.

56:01.454 --> 56:02.618
Line?

56:02.620 --> 56:04.284
Well, it looks like you two have
plans.

56:04.286 --> 56:05.352
I should be going.

56:05.354 --> 56:06.354
Huh?

56:08.454 --> 56:09.454
Well, um.

56:09.787 --> 56:11.788
It looks like you two have
plans.

56:13.821 --> 56:15.384
I should be going.

56:15.386 --> 56:17.353
Maybe we can all catch up later?

56:20.821 --> 56:21.821
Later gator.

56:23.854 --> 56:24.855
I'd like that.

56:25.520 --> 56:27.522
It was nice to meet you,
Bubblegum.

56:46.787 --> 56:48.789
I didn't watch the Falling in
Love reel.

56:49.522 --> 56:50.523
Is that us?

56:51.321 --> 56:52.389
Are we a thing?

56:53.689 --> 56:54.689
Where is this going?

56:56.321 --> 56:57.456
We need to talk.

56:58.022 --> 56:59.657
That old line.

57:01.022 --> 57:02.223
Line?

57:02.788 --> 57:03.789
We do need to talk.

57:08.323 --> 57:09.757
We do need to talk.

57:11.023 --> 57:12.224
No.

57:19.624 --> 57:20.924
We have talked about it.

57:22.322 --> 57:24.354
Maybe you don't remember every
reel,

57:24.356 --> 57:25.357
but I do.

57:27.623 --> 57:28.821
You push me away.

57:28.823 --> 57:30.355
And push me away.

57:30.357 --> 57:31.921
What do you think is going to
happen

57:31.923 --> 57:33.257
if you keep pushing?

57:37.324 --> 57:39.325
I just don't want another
tragedy.

57:40.923 --> 57:41.924
Forget all that.

57:42.625 --> 57:43.622
Just tell me

57:43.624 --> 57:44.888
once and for all

57:44.890 --> 57:46.892
how you feel about me.

59:01.861 --> 59:02.892
Aren't you just

59:02.894 --> 59:03.891
supposed to me tell me

59:03.893 --> 59:05.794
that it's all gonna be alright?

59:07.028 --> 59:09.229
It's all going to be alright.

59:12.527 --> 59:13.528
It's not though.

59:14.861 --> 59:15.859
You think that

59:15.861 --> 59:17.360
doom and despair is coming

59:17.362 --> 59:18.726
because you're not miserable

59:18.728 --> 59:19.725
in this moment.

59:19.727 --> 59:20.729
But you don't know.

59:23.628 --> 59:24.627
Maybe this is

59:24.629 --> 59:26.629
the worst moment in your life.

59:27.829 --> 59:29.359
Maybe you'll die

59:29.361 --> 59:30.628
when you close your eyes.

59:35.527 --> 59:36.528
I'm fine.

59:42.895 --> 59:43.892
Gary?

59:43.894 --> 59:45.729
What can I do for you?

59:47.928 --> 59:48.929
Maybe

59:50.428 --> 59:52.430
on the next arbitrary holiday

59:53.363 --> 59:54.363
you can

59:54.596 --> 59:56.427
rush to meet me at an

59:56.429 --> 59:57.630
arbitrary place.

59:58.362 --> 59:59.529
Like at 8:00 PM.

01:00:00.963 --> 01:00:02.660
It'll be 7:59

01:00:02.662 --> 01:00:04.295
and I'll be sure you're not
coming.

01:00:04.297 --> 01:00:06.364
And then you'll show up.

01:00:07.631 --> 01:00:08.631
And then I'll know.

01:00:09.996 --> 01:00:11.198
Really know.

01:00:12.329 --> 01:00:13.730
That it's all going to be okay.

01:00:16.463 --> 01:00:18.430
You're really not making this
easy for me.

01:00:19.364 --> 01:00:20.798
What do I like about you again?

01:00:22.631 --> 01:00:23.628
I'm interesting

01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:24.765
and I take beauty in.

01:00:26.998 --> 01:00:28.499
Now close your eyes.

01:00:34.997 --> 01:00:36.932
There's this canal in Amsterdam.

01:00:39.330 --> 01:00:40.598
I've seen pictures of it.

01:00:42.932 --> 01:00:44.629
I can see it in my head.

01:00:44.631 --> 01:00:45.632
And I'm

01:00:46.298 --> 01:00:47.695
projecting it into your head

01:00:47.697 --> 01:00:48.698
right now.

01:00:52.498 --> 01:00:53.500
Can you see it?

01:01:01.465 --> 01:01:02.466
Yeah.

01:01:02.899 --> 01:01:03.900
I think so.

01:01:04.466 --> 01:01:06.465
I've seen pictures like that
before.

01:01:10.766 --> 01:01:11.767
Good.

01:01:14.633 --> 01:01:15.630
Meet me there.

01:01:15.632 --> 01:01:16.633
At 8:00 PM.

01:01:17.499 --> 01:01:19.666
On the next arbitrary holiday.

01:01:22.799 --> 01:01:23.800
Sure.

01:01:35.532 --> 01:01:36.533
Hey.

01:01:39.034 --> 01:01:40.632
If your lead singer gets a
girlfriend,

01:01:40.634 --> 01:01:41.834
does your band break up?

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:44.368
That's not the hardline.

01:01:45.601 --> 01:01:46.599
Line?

01:01:46.601 --> 01:01:47.466
Bubblegum.

01:01:47.468 --> 01:01:48.366
Come here for a minute.

01:01:48.368 --> 01:01:49.232
You've got to see this.

01:01:49.234 --> 01:01:50.632
Hey Bubblegum. Come here for a
minute.

01:01:50.634 --> 01:01:52.234
You've got to see this.

01:01:53.334 --> 01:01:54.466
Huh?

01:01:54.468 --> 01:01:55.465
No. Really.

01:01:55.467 --> 01:01:56.468
Come here.

01:01:57.333 --> 01:01:58.734
Okay. Hang on.

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:01.599
Who are you talking to?

01:02:01.601 --> 01:02:02.598
It's Davey.

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:03.601
He's a metaphor.

01:02:04.433 --> 01:02:05.531
I'll be right back.

01:02:05.533 --> 01:02:07.402
You have to stop pushing me
away.

01:02:09.901 --> 01:02:11.635
I'm in love with you.

01:02:11.834 --> 01:02:12.834
I...

01:02:15.635 --> 01:02:16.636
What?

01:02:22.335 --> 01:02:23.335
Look.

01:02:26.635 --> 01:02:27.636
Why is that there?

01:02:27.936 --> 01:02:29.033
I don't know.

01:02:29.035 --> 01:02:30.634
I didn't design the place.

01:02:30.636 --> 01:02:31.636
I just work here.

01:02:55.737 --> 01:02:56.737
Hey Davey.

01:02:56.937 --> 01:02:58.534
Can you get me out of here

01:02:58.536 --> 01:02:59.971
if I run into any trouble?

01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:02.271
Prolly.

01:03:02.637 --> 01:03:04.505
I'm going to lunch now, though.

01:04:47.907 --> 01:04:48.908
Merci.

01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:51.606
So.

01:04:51.608 --> 01:04:53.609
At last you have come to visit
me.

01:04:54.674 --> 01:04:55.675
Oui.

01:04:56.409 --> 01:04:57.409
And?

01:05:04.475 --> 01:05:05.841
Très bien.

01:05:07.408 --> 01:05:09.343
I cannot place your accent.

01:05:09.776 --> 01:05:11.609
Je suis American.

01:05:12.575 --> 01:05:13.507
Ah.

01:05:13.509 --> 01:05:15.643
Let me know if you'd like
another drink.

01:05:18.376 --> 01:05:19.610
Yes. What is it?

01:05:23.009 --> 01:05:25.310
That is the question, isn't it?

01:05:25.542 --> 01:05:26.974
Why are we here?

01:05:26.976 --> 01:05:29.611
Why is anything anything?

01:05:30.410 --> 01:05:32.607
You may not have the
answer to this question.

01:05:32.609 --> 01:05:33.610
But I do.

01:05:34.377 --> 01:05:36.607
Life is pain.

01:05:36.609 --> 01:05:37.811
And meaningless.

01:05:38.342 --> 01:05:40.608
You are here to throw away love

01:05:40.610 --> 01:05:42.642
and joy into the gutter

01:05:42.644 --> 01:05:44.642
until you are lying in the
gutter

01:05:44.644 --> 01:05:45.878
in your own suffering.

01:05:50.344 --> 01:05:51.475
Yes.

01:05:51.477 --> 01:05:52.679
Meaningless. All of it.

01:05:53.377 --> 01:05:54.709
What is it you want?

01:05:54.711 --> 01:05:56.645
A life full of love?

01:05:57.011 --> 01:05:58.645
An end without tragedy?

01:05:58.910 --> 01:05:59.911
Oui.

01:06:00.343 --> 01:06:01.344
Oui.

01:06:07.544 --> 01:06:08.643
Then there are two things

01:06:08.645 --> 01:06:09.611
you must do.

01:06:10.044 --> 01:06:11.309
Embrace the moments

01:06:11.311 --> 01:06:12.608
that are not meaningless

01:06:12.610 --> 01:06:14.844
in this tragedy that was your
life.

01:06:23.745 --> 01:06:24.746
Et?

01:06:25.779 --> 01:06:27.543
Stay out

01:06:27.545 --> 01:06:29.512
of French Basements.

01:06:36.545 --> 01:06:37.542
Ah. No, no.

01:06:37.544 --> 01:06:38.577
Not that way.

01:06:38.579 --> 01:06:39.780
That is my bedroom.

01:06:53.946 --> 01:06:54.945
Au revoir

01:06:54.947 --> 01:06:56.977
Bubblegum.

01:06:56.979 --> 01:06:59.214
Au revoir, French Bartender.

01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:10.647
Where'd he go?

01:07:12.513 --> 01:07:13.514
Davey?

01:07:17.481 --> 01:07:18.481
C'est la vie.

01:07:30.447 --> 01:07:31.647
I'll be right back.

01:07:31.649 --> 01:07:33.612
You have to stop pushing me
away.

01:07:33.614 --> 01:07:34.613
I'm in love with you.

01:07:34.615 --> 01:07:35.716
I'll be right back.

01:07:38.015 --> 01:07:39.612
Stop pushing me away.

01:07:39.614 --> 01:07:40.615
I'm in love with you.

01:07:44.281 --> 01:07:45.283
I'll be right back.

01:07:45.615 --> 01:07:47.513
Stop pushing me away, Bubblegum.

01:07:47.515 --> 01:07:48.616
I'm in love with you.

01:07:49.515 --> 01:07:50.849
I'm in love with you too, Gary.

01:07:57.649 --> 01:07:59.649
I love you.

01:08:00.650 --> 01:08:01.650
I love you, Gary.

01:08:04.449 --> 01:08:06.513
I'm in love with you too, Gary.

01:08:06.515 --> 01:08:08.416
How hard would that have been?

01:08:20.484 --> 01:08:21.716
No way.

01:09:07.319 --> 01:09:08.319
This isn't good.

01:09:13.486 --> 01:09:14.617
Bubblegum?

01:09:14.618 --> 01:09:15.620
In here.

01:09:18.853 --> 01:09:19.853
Whatcha doin'?

01:09:20.819 --> 01:09:21.819
Packing.

01:09:23.618 --> 01:09:24.587
Bunch of headbands?

01:09:25.653 --> 01:09:26.653
Check.

01:09:27.986 --> 01:09:29.587
Old lady underwear?

01:09:30.319 --> 01:09:31.321
Check.

01:09:33.719 --> 01:09:34.720
Passport?

01:09:37.819 --> 01:09:39.553
I think it's still in the car.

01:09:40.519 --> 01:09:41.618
What's up?

01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:42.618
Nothing.

01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:43.617
Lydia wanted me to

01:09:43.618 --> 01:09:44.617
see what you were doing.

01:09:44.618 --> 01:09:45.618
She hopes that you don't

01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:46.888
think she's too weird.

01:09:48.319 --> 01:09:50.620
Dude. I think she's perfect.

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:53.255
I'll tell her you said that.

01:09:53.618 --> 01:09:54.621
Go ahead.

01:09:56.686 --> 01:09:57.688
Where're you going?

01:09:58.787 --> 01:09:59.788
Amsterdam.

01:10:00.453 --> 01:10:01.722
Do you know how to get there?

01:10:01.954 --> 01:10:03.655
Go to Europe and turn left.

01:10:05.454 --> 01:10:06.888
That shouldn't be too hard.

01:10:13.821 --> 01:10:14.822
Do you need a ride?

01:10:15.454 --> 01:10:16.486
I don't think you can

01:10:16.488 --> 01:10:17.654
drive to Amsterdam.

01:10:22.389 --> 01:10:23.389
Are you really leaving?

01:10:23.621 --> 01:10:24.623
When are you coming back?

01:10:24.954 --> 01:10:26.019
What airline?

01:10:26.021 --> 01:10:27.622
Airline?

01:10:27.921 --> 01:10:28.985
I'm coming back.

01:10:28.987 --> 01:10:30.386
Don't worry about me.

01:10:30.388 --> 01:10:32.389
There's just something I have to
do.

01:10:33.321 --> 01:10:34.420
Did you catch that?

01:10:34.422 --> 01:10:35.423
Yeah.

01:10:40.822 --> 01:10:41.823
'kay bye.

01:10:52.656 --> 01:10:53.656
Do you need help?

01:10:54.422 --> 01:10:55.656
No. I got it.

01:11:42.625 --> 01:11:44.389
Bubblegum, what is the matter?

01:11:44.391 --> 01:11:45.389
Hi.

01:11:45.391 --> 01:11:46.391
Hi?

01:11:46.625 --> 01:11:48.489
What is with "Hi?"

01:11:48.491 --> 01:11:50.290
I need to get to Holland in a
hurry.

01:11:50.292 --> 01:11:51.757
Can I please go through your
bedroom?

01:11:51.759 --> 01:11:53.593
To catch a train from France?

01:12:04.958 --> 01:12:06.826
If it's not too much trouble.

01:12:07.625 --> 01:12:08.624
Young lady.

01:12:08.626 --> 01:12:09.891
I cannot understand a word

01:12:09.893 --> 01:12:10.894
you are saying.

01:12:12.659 --> 01:12:13.659
Ah.

01:12:20.726 --> 01:12:22.524
Yes. Of course.

01:12:22.526 --> 01:12:23.826
What does it matter to me?

01:12:25.926 --> 01:12:27.293
Merci.

01:12:47.626 --> 01:12:49.628
It couldn't have been Paris,
right?

01:15:51.834 --> 01:15:52.836
Beautiful.

01:16:33.671 --> 01:16:34.637
Hey, Davey?

01:16:34.970 --> 01:16:35.971
What time is it?

01:16:39.569 --> 01:16:41.004
Thanks.

01:16:53.337 --> 01:16:54.339
Hey!

01:17:58.407 --> 01:17:59.407
What.

01:18:28.641 --> 01:18:30.641
He's coming.

01:19:27.477 --> 01:19:28.644
Fiddle dee dee.

01:19:44.644 --> 01:19:45.646
Tragedy.

01:19:46.444 --> 01:19:47.646
Again.

01:19:49.877 --> 01:19:51.509
Maybe it's enough to stay out of

01:19:51.511 --> 01:19:52.646
French Basements.

01:19:55.444 --> 01:19:57.646
I'll just embrace the small
moments of...

01:20:28.646 --> 01:20:30.646
Bubblegum.
