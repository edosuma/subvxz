02:30.784 --> 02:34.245
Standing in the door,
I could see...

02:34.246 --> 02:36.491
...the lights on a drop zone.

02:36.498 --> 02:41.794
And I had to assume that was
our drop zone, way ahead of us.

02:41.795 --> 02:44.589
And...

02:44.590 --> 02:48.009
So we had the red light.

02:48.010 --> 02:51.971
I had everybody standing up,
ready to jump.

02:51.972 --> 02:56.142
So when the plane started
to get hit, and suddenly...

02:56.143 --> 03:00.521
...the pilot gives me the green light,
I'm out the door.

03:00.522 --> 03:05.735
Got such an opening blast
or opening shot from the prop blast...

03:05.736 --> 03:11.908
...that it broke this chinstrap
that we had on the helmet liner.

03:11.909 --> 03:16.245
That's when I lost this famous leg bag
everybody talks about.

03:16.246 --> 03:22.126
Just from the shock of the opening.
It just flew right off my foot.

03:22.127 --> 03:24.879
We came from the sky.

03:24.880 --> 03:31.385
We hit, and in any direction you went,
there would be enemy. You knew it.

03:31.386 --> 03:35.097
And that was all part of what
you accepted.

03:35.098 --> 03:39.018
How do you prepare yourself mentally?

03:39.019 --> 03:42.230
Each man must do that himself.

03:42.231 --> 03:46.400
Each man must prepare
himself mentally...

03:46.401 --> 03:49.487
...to make that jump.

03:49.488 --> 03:53.783
In the back of your mind,
you wonder what's gonna happen.

03:53.784 --> 03:57.078
You know you've been trained
and trained...

03:57.079 --> 04:01.332
...and what your job is
and what you're supposed to do.

04:01.333 --> 04:07.463
That's what you gotta think about.
We lost a lot of people that night.

04:07.464 --> 04:13.675
But you try to put
it all out of your mind.

05:08.066 --> 05:10.401
Smith!

05:10.402 --> 05:13.541
Give me a light.

05:43.101 --> 05:46.145
Lip! Did Evans make it?

05:46.146 --> 05:51.401
Yes, sir.
He's in Lt. Meehan's stick, sir.

05:59.159 --> 06:02.703
Lt. Meehan. Lt. Meehan.

06:02.704 --> 06:06.082
Will could use some help.

06:13.173 --> 06:14.924
Will!

06:14.925 --> 06:18.576
Will, hey! Will!
I need your help here.

07:49.603 --> 07:52.396
Get ready!

07:52.397 --> 07:55.127
Stand up!

07:55.817 --> 07:58.273
Hook up!

07:59.821 --> 08:03.313
Equipment check!

08:07.162 --> 08:10.581
- Sound off for equipment check!
- Ten okay!

08:10.582 --> 08:12.792
- Nine okay!
- Eight okay!

08:12.793 --> 08:14.627
- Seven okay!
- Six okay!

08:14.628 --> 08:16.504
- Five okay!
- Four okay!

08:16.505 --> 08:18.673
- Three okay!
- Two okay!

08:18.674 --> 08:20.448
One okay!

08:55.752 --> 08:58.170
Jesus Christ!
Let's go, let's go!

08:58.171 --> 09:01.757
- Does that light look green to you?
- Let's go!

09:01.758 --> 09:04.488
I'm hit!

09:15.480 --> 09:19.939
Jesus! Tell Meehan
to get them out of there!

09:30.871 --> 09:32.997
Two o'clock!

09:32.998 --> 09:35.568
Oh, Jesus Christ!

10:00.525 --> 10:02.318
- Go!
- He won't jump, sir!

10:02.319 --> 10:05.321
- Don't listen!
- He's staying on the plane!

10:05.322 --> 10:08.199
He's not jumping.

10:08.200 --> 10:11.953
- He's okay! Go, sir! Go!
- All right!

10:11.954 --> 10:14.763
Son of a bitch.

10:27.678 --> 10:29.736
Where's the goddamn DZ?

10:29.763 --> 10:34.642
- Maybe three minutes on this bearing!
- We get lower, we won't need...

10:34.643 --> 10:36.811
...any frigging parachutes!

10:36.812 --> 10:40.106
- Slow down!
- We gotta get some altitude!

10:40.107 --> 10:43.234
They can't jump at this speed!

10:43.235 --> 10:45.885
We there?

10:46.446 --> 10:47.905
Oh, God!

10:47.906 --> 10:50.044
Oh, no!

10:52.536 --> 10:55.266
Let's go!

11:43.629 --> 11:46.672
- Flash.
- Shit.

11:46.673 --> 11:49.383
That's not the correct reply,
trooper.

11:49.384 --> 11:55.083
- I say "flash," you say "thunder."
- Yes, sir. Thunder, sir.

11:58.101 --> 12:00.956
Musette bag.

12:03.357 --> 12:07.818
Coach? Sir, it's Hall, sir.
I was on the basketball team.

12:07.819 --> 12:10.446
- Leg bag?
- Prop blast got it, sir.

12:10.447 --> 12:14.542
- And my radio and batteries with it.
- Mine too.

12:14.743 --> 12:18.235
Landed somewhere behind those trees.

12:19.373 --> 12:22.103
Okay.

12:22.584 --> 12:25.279
Follow me.

12:31.134 --> 12:33.864
To hell with that!

12:55.409 --> 12:58.423
Wait until they reload.

13:00.622 --> 13:03.158
Go.

13:05.794 --> 13:10.367
- Aren't you D Company?
- Able, sir.

13:10.757 --> 13:13.718
Means one of us
is in the wrong zone.

13:13.719 --> 13:17.336
Yeah, or both of us.

13:17.973 --> 13:22.386
- Do you have a weapon, sir?
- Just my knife.

13:24.646 --> 13:28.104
Do you have any idea
where we are, sir?

13:30.235 --> 13:32.726
Some.

13:34.406 --> 13:37.742
- So you're a radioman.
- Yes, sir.

13:37.743 --> 13:43.080
I was until I lost my radio on the jump.
I'll get chewed out for that.

13:43.081 --> 13:49.170
If you were in my platoon, I'd say you
were a rifleman first, radioman second.

13:49.171 --> 13:54.508
Maybe you could say that to my leader.
When we find him. If we find him.

13:54.509 --> 13:56.427
It's a deal.

13:56.428 --> 14:02.266
First, I need your help. Locate some
landmarks to get our bearings.

14:02.267 --> 14:06.437
Keep your eyes peeled
for buildings, farmhouses...

14:06.438 --> 14:11.454
...bridges, roads, trees.

14:14.404 --> 14:17.448
I wonder if the rest
are as lost as we are.

14:17.449 --> 14:22.227
We're not lost, private.
We're in Normandy.

14:59.324 --> 15:04.693
- Who's that?
- Lt. Winters? Is that you?

15:08.458 --> 15:11.127
- Sit down. Any weapon?
- No, sir.

15:11.128 --> 15:15.631
I hit the prop blast, no more leg bag.
I have a knife and TNT.

15:15.632 --> 15:18.634
- The 82nd boys got M-1 s though.
- 82nd?

15:18.635 --> 15:22.138
- Where are we?
- Sir, I saw a sign back there.

15:22.139 --> 15:25.517
It said "Sainte-Mere-Eglise."

15:31.398 --> 15:33.900
Flashlight?

15:33.901 --> 15:35.151
Raincoat?

15:35.152 --> 15:38.689
- You got a raincoat?
- Yeah, yeah.

16:01.220 --> 16:06.432
Seven kilometers from our objective.
Four hours from our deadline.

16:06.433 --> 16:10.561
So, we got a lot of walking
ahead of us.

16:10.562 --> 16:13.898
You'll stick with us
until we find your unit.

16:13.899 --> 16:15.942
Let's go.

16:15.943 --> 16:19.111
- Where are we going?
- Causeway 2, Utah Beach.

16:19.112 --> 16:23.074
Germans in the fields.
We need to clear it for our boys.

16:23.075 --> 16:28.246
Five of us won't secure a road.
That looey don't even have a weapon.

16:28.247 --> 16:31.374
I don't recall railroads
near our objective.

16:31.375 --> 16:34.919
This is the spur line,
parallel to the river.

16:34.920 --> 16:38.047
- We'll see a road and bridge.
- How do you know?

16:38.048 --> 16:41.824
Because I studied
the sand tables, all right?

16:44.972 --> 16:48.432
Probably a frigging train or...

16:48.433 --> 16:51.572
- Flash.
- Thunder.

16:51.937 --> 16:54.230
Lieutenant, is that you?

16:54.231 --> 16:56.148
- Malarkey.
- Sir. Sir.

16:56.149 --> 16:58.693
- Glad to see you, sir.
- Hey, fellas.

16:58.694 --> 17:01.404
- Everybody okay?
- Good to see you.

17:01.405 --> 17:02.947
- Guarnere?
- Sir.

17:02.948 --> 17:05.950
You and Hall up front.

17:05.951 --> 17:08.681
Who the hell is Hall?

17:40.736 --> 17:44.831
Lipton. Go. Guarnere.

18:05.761 --> 18:07.853
Wait for my command.

18:30.369 --> 18:33.144
Grenade!

18:49.972 --> 18:53.225
That's enough, Guarnere!

18:54.351 --> 18:58.366
- Everyone okay?
- Yes, sir.

18:58.647 --> 19:04.443
Next time I say wait for my command,
you wait for my command, sergeant.

19:04.444 --> 19:06.980
Yes, sir.

19:13.078 --> 19:16.968
Here you go, lieutenant.
Kraut weapon.

19:19.835 --> 19:23.054
Fine, Quaker.

19:26.967 --> 19:30.011
- What's that guy's problem?
- Gonorrhea.

19:30.012 --> 19:31.470
Really?

19:31.471 --> 19:35.057
His name, dummy.
Guarnere, gonorrhea, get it?

19:35.058 --> 19:38.394
So besides a shitty name,
what's his problem?

19:38.395 --> 19:41.480
None of your fucking business, cowboy.

19:41.481 --> 19:44.817
- All right, let's move out.
- Sir.

19:44.818 --> 19:47.548
Quietly.

20:04.171 --> 20:08.424
- You see him? He just sat there.
- He didn't have a weapon.

20:08.425 --> 20:12.762
- What's he gonna do, shout?
- Shouts at me for killing Krauts.

20:12.763 --> 20:15.848
He just wanted you to wait
for his command.

20:15.849 --> 20:19.182
Joe, he don't even drink.

20:35.953 --> 20:39.047
Lipton! Wynn!

21:17.828 --> 21:22.367
Anybody need supplies or ammo,
now's the time to get it.

21:26.253 --> 21:28.880
McDowell!
You okay?

21:28.881 --> 21:31.815
- Yes, sergeant.
- Well, let's go.

21:41.268 --> 21:45.688
I promised my brother I'd bring
him a Luger. I got first dibs.

21:45.689 --> 21:48.384
Check that one.

21:52.404 --> 21:54.947
- The Navy!
- Landings have started.

21:54.948 --> 21:57.241
- Move it out.
- Right on time.

21:57.242 --> 22:00.870
- Yeah? Tell that to him, cowboy.
- My name's Hall.

22:00.871 --> 22:04.123
- That so?
- Let's move out.

22:04.124 --> 22:08.002
- Learn to return his fire.
- It ain't about you.

22:08.003 --> 22:12.178
- He heard his brother...
- Malarkey, shut your yap.

22:12.633 --> 22:17.126
His brother got it at Cassino.
Found out before we jumped.

22:29.983 --> 22:31.442
Morning, sir.

22:31.443 --> 22:34.654
- Battalion will be happy to see you.
- Where?

22:34.655 --> 22:36.364
At the farm, sir.

22:36.365 --> 22:40.326
Top of the morning to you, fellas.
Enjoying the war?

22:40.327 --> 22:43.102
Where you from, son?

22:43.455 --> 22:46.249
Eugene, Oregon.

22:46.250 --> 22:49.210
Eugene?
You gotta be kidding me.

22:49.211 --> 22:52.547
Popeye, did you hear this?
I'm from Astoria.

22:52.548 --> 22:56.300
- You don't say.
- Yeah. Orange Street.

22:56.301 --> 23:00.680
- Why are you in a Kraut uniform?
- Volksdeutsche.

23:00.681 --> 23:04.600
- Come again?
- My family answered the call.

23:04.601 --> 23:08.020
All true Aryans should return
to the Fatherland.

23:08.021 --> 23:11.065
- Joined up in '41.
- You're shitting me.

23:11.066 --> 23:16.320
Hey, Malarkey! Stop fraternizing
with the enemy! Get over here!

23:16.321 --> 23:19.740
- What got you to Eugene?
- I was born in Eugene.

23:19.741 --> 23:21.640
Really?

23:33.839 --> 23:36.090
Popeye.

23:36.091 --> 23:38.946
Hey, Popeye!

23:39.511 --> 23:42.346
- Hey, Harry!
- Carry on.

23:42.347 --> 23:45.315
Easy Company.

23:45.517 --> 23:47.894
- Hey, Popeye.
- Good to see you.

23:47.895 --> 23:51.731
- This here's Hall, Able Company.
- Known as Cowboy.

23:51.732 --> 23:53.858
- You from Texas?
- Manhattan.

23:53.859 --> 23:56.236
Lt. Winters!

23:57.863 --> 24:01.241
- What's the holdup?
- Not sure.

24:01.617 --> 24:05.661
Five'll get you ten
it's got something to do with that.

24:05.662 --> 24:07.413
It's good to see you.

24:07.414 --> 24:10.416
Yeah, you too, Buck.
What's the situation?

24:10.417 --> 24:14.587
Not good. Ninety percent of
the men are unaccounted for.

24:14.588 --> 24:18.716
- Lt. Meehan?
- No one's seen him.

24:18.717 --> 24:20.384
If he is missing...

24:20.385 --> 24:25.197
...wouldn't that put you in line
to be the next commander of Easy?

24:27.726 --> 24:30.820
Hey, Lt. Speirs.

24:31.939 --> 24:34.941
How many men of Dog Company
got assembled?

24:34.942 --> 24:38.527
- Maybe 20.
- You the only officer that made it?

24:38.528 --> 24:40.738
So far.

24:40.739 --> 24:45.117
Still waiting for orders.
You got some cigarettes?

24:45.118 --> 24:47.688
Yeah.

24:48.914 --> 24:50.248
Keep the pack.

24:50.249 --> 24:53.084
Yeah, so I was in the plant in '39.

24:53.085 --> 24:58.214
I was at Monarch tooling propeller
shafts. What are the chances?

24:58.215 --> 25:02.385
You and me a hundred miles apart,
working at the same job.

25:02.386 --> 25:06.264
- Hey, Malark! We're waiting on you.
- Yeah, I'm coming.

25:06.265 --> 25:08.808
I gotta run.
I'll see you around.

25:08.809 --> 25:13.268
Yeah, see you around.

25:23.156 --> 25:25.533
Zigaretten?

25:26.910 --> 25:29.162
Here you go.

25:31.665 --> 25:34.156
Danke.

25:35.669 --> 25:37.318
Danke.

25:39.381 --> 25:41.599
Thank you.

25:50.601 --> 25:53.102
Shit.

25:53.103 --> 25:55.563
Easy Company?

25:55.564 --> 25:57.899
Easy?

25:57.900 --> 26:01.676
Hey, any of you guys know
where Easy Company is?

26:02.237 --> 26:04.906
- You seen Lt. Meehan?
- No, not yet.

26:04.907 --> 26:09.076
Well, Maj. Strayer wants
Easy Company's CO up front.

26:09.077 --> 26:11.412
- That means you, Dick.
- Come on.

26:11.413 --> 26:13.710
Son of a bitch.

26:15.667 --> 26:19.503
Hey, Malark, where's the best chow?

26:19.504 --> 26:22.279
In Berlin.

26:26.136 --> 26:29.138
- Let's round them up.
- Okay. Get them.

26:29.139 --> 26:32.099
- And the MGs?
- I'd say around here, sir.

26:32.100 --> 26:34.830
But I can't be sure.

26:34.978 --> 26:39.899
There's Kraut 88s. Ahead
and to the right about 300 yards.

26:39.900 --> 26:43.945
Through the gardens. They're
between us and Causeway 2.

26:43.946 --> 26:46.531
Firing on the boys landing at Utah.

26:46.532 --> 26:48.783
- Can Easy handle it?
- Yes, sir.

26:48.784 --> 26:53.118
My guess is, they're doing
some terrible damage there.

26:53.288 --> 26:57.124
Does the major know we
only have 12 Easy Company men?

26:57.125 --> 26:59.168
No.

26:59.169 --> 27:03.756
The 88s we've heard
have been spotted in a field...

27:03.757 --> 27:06.259
...down the road a ways.

27:06.260 --> 27:09.178
Major Strayer wants us
to take them out.

27:09.179 --> 27:13.432
There are two guns that we know of,
firing on Utah Beach.

27:13.433 --> 27:16.185
Plan on a third and a fourth...

27:16.186 --> 27:20.022
...here and here.
The Germans are in the trenches...

27:20.023 --> 27:25.027
...with access to the entire battery.
Machine gun covering the rear.

27:25.028 --> 27:30.397
We establish a base of fire and move
under it with two squads of three.

27:30.450 --> 27:33.244
How many Krauts
you think we're facing?

27:33.245 --> 27:37.818
- No idea.
- No idea?

27:39.126 --> 27:43.045
We'll take some TNT along with us.
Despite the guns.

27:43.046 --> 27:45.339
- Your responsibility.
- Yes, sir.

27:45.340 --> 27:49.427
Liebgott, take the first machine gun,
with Petty A-gunner.

27:49.428 --> 27:53.639
Plesha, Hendrix, you take the other.
Who does that leave?

27:53.640 --> 27:57.935
Compton, Malarkey,
Toye, Guarnere. Okay.

27:57.936 --> 28:01.439
We'll be making the main assault.
Understood?

28:01.440 --> 28:02.857
Yes, sir.

28:02.858 --> 28:05.428
Let's pack it up, boys.

28:06.236 --> 28:09.363
Shouldn't you be with
the Able Company guys?

28:09.364 --> 28:12.298
See you around, Hall.

28:16.914 --> 28:22.501
Lipton, when you see we've captured
the first gun, I want your TNT fast.

28:22.502 --> 28:24.151
Yes, sir.

28:25.130 --> 28:28.758
Okay. Just weapons and ammo,
drop everything else.

28:28.759 --> 28:32.428
Got spare ammo in a pack
or a musette bag, bring it.

28:32.429 --> 28:36.766
Lieutenant, sir? I was wondering,
you need an extra hand?

28:36.767 --> 28:39.518
- Ain't you Sink's jeep driver?
- So?

28:39.519 --> 28:40.811
Oh, shit.

28:40.812 --> 28:43.105
What's your name, trooper?

28:43.106 --> 28:46.150
- Lorraine, sir.
- You're with me, Lorraine.

28:46.151 --> 28:48.569
- Compton, second squad.
- Yes, sir!

28:48.570 --> 28:53.188
All right, you heard the word.
Let's move! Let's move!

28:59.706 --> 29:01.958
Fire!

29:28.151 --> 29:30.642
Go.

29:32.114 --> 29:34.889
Three cannons.

29:40.497 --> 29:44.041
Petty, we've got enfilading fire.

29:44.042 --> 29:47.500
All right, let's go. Stay down.

29:59.224 --> 30:04.770
MG42s. I'll draw fire to the right of
the truck. Take two men and hit them...

30:04.771 --> 30:06.522
...from the left. Go.

30:06.523 --> 30:08.661
Right.

30:13.530 --> 30:18.451
Take Ranney, envelop right, give
covering fire. Lorraine, machine gun.

30:18.452 --> 30:21.120
Don't give away your position early.

30:21.121 --> 30:24.790
I want TNT as soon as we've
captured the first gun.

30:24.791 --> 30:27.441
- Go.
- Yes, sir.

30:44.478 --> 30:45.967
Go.

30:51.944 --> 30:54.912
I can't see nothing.

31:44.162 --> 31:46.892
Come on, Buck.

32:13.567 --> 32:15.295
Shit!

32:20.365 --> 32:22.457
Let's go! Let's go!

32:22.868 --> 32:24.926
Follow me!

32:33.587 --> 32:36.123
Come on!

32:37.549 --> 32:41.439
Fuck! My ass!

32:44.932 --> 32:47.423
Sorry, sir.

32:50.145 --> 32:52.556
Jesus Christ!

32:56.235 --> 32:58.152
Fucking jeep jockey.

32:58.153 --> 33:03.363
Shit! I'm sorry, sir.
I screwed up.

33:04.952 --> 33:07.286
Grenade!

33:07.287 --> 33:10.289
Joe! Toye! Roll on! Roll on!

33:10.290 --> 33:13.099
Get off!

33:14.378 --> 33:15.586
Shoot!

33:15.587 --> 33:18.203
One lucky bastard, Joe.

33:26.139 --> 33:30.473
Guarnere! Malarkey! Lorraine!
Secure that gun!

33:32.729 --> 33:36.619
- Compton, covering fire!
- Yes, sir!

33:47.578 --> 33:50.997
- Where you hit, Pop?
- I fucked up my ass, sir.

33:50.998 --> 33:53.648
Your ass?

33:55.252 --> 33:57.086
- Shit.
- How bad is it?

33:57.087 --> 34:03.184
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to
fuck up. I don't think it's too bad.

34:03.886 --> 34:06.679
- Can you make it back yourself?
- Yes.

34:06.680 --> 34:08.681
Let's move out.

34:08.681 --> 34:13.393
Here we go. Drop your weapon, Pop,
drop your weapon. Come on.

34:13.395 --> 34:16.022
One, two, three!

34:16.023 --> 34:18.161
Get down, Dick, get down!

34:18.442 --> 34:21.235
Pop!

34:21.235 --> 34:24.091
Popeye! Get down!

34:24.864 --> 34:28.701
Winters! One o'clock!

34:28.702 --> 34:30.119
Grenade!

34:30.120 --> 34:35.208
Toye! Let's go! Get out of there!
Get out of there!

34:35.208 --> 34:37.779
Toye!

34:37.793 --> 34:41.088
- Joe!
- Jesus Christ.

34:41.089 --> 34:44.387
Fucking twice.

34:46.637 --> 34:49.935
Jesus Christ!

34:51.016 --> 34:53.684
Lorraine! Move! Go!

34:53.685 --> 34:56.380
Malark!

35:02.152 --> 35:05.610
Ranney!
Let's move! They got the first gun!

35:13.080 --> 35:15.998
- There's the second gun.
- Grenades first.

35:15.999 --> 35:18.330
- Then keep going. Go!
- Right.

35:24.424 --> 35:26.835
Okay.

35:27.553 --> 35:30.567
Go!

35:38.564 --> 35:40.273
Shut up.

35:40.274 --> 35:42.191
- No make dead.
- Shut up.

35:42.192 --> 35:46.287
- No make dead.
- Shut the fuck up!

35:51.326 --> 35:54.745
Toye, stay down.
Stay down!

35:54.746 --> 35:58.636
- Compton!
- All right. Cover for me.

36:00.419 --> 36:04.297
They're so confused,
they're firing on the third gun!

36:04.298 --> 36:07.049
Better blow this
before they realize it.

36:07.050 --> 36:12.385
- I'm gonna find Lipton.
- All right. Toye! Cover the lieutenant!

36:15.100 --> 36:18.019
- One of the dead Krauts has a Luger!
- So?

36:18.020 --> 36:20.813
Keep your head low, Petty.
Move it!

36:20.814 --> 36:25.860
- Have a little suppressing fire!
- Jesus Christ!

36:25.861 --> 36:28.636
Malarkey!

36:29.740 --> 36:32.033
- Now you stop firing?
- Stay low!

36:32.034 --> 36:35.369
- Shit.
- Christ, they must think he's a medic.

36:35.370 --> 36:37.663
He's gonna need a damn medic.

36:37.664 --> 36:40.082
Okay, okay, okay.

36:40.083 --> 36:42.539
Malarkey!

36:43.712 --> 36:47.048
- Stay low!
- What the hell's he doing?

36:47.049 --> 36:49.141
Come on!

36:53.764 --> 36:59.736
Forgot your frigging Luger? Want I
should go get it for you? Stupid mick!

37:01.605 --> 37:05.858
- Where's Lipton with that TNT?
- Don't know, sir.

37:05.859 --> 37:08.236
- You'll be all right.
- I'm sorry.

37:08.237 --> 37:09.779
- Don't be.
- Sarge?

37:09.780 --> 37:12.448
- Yeah?
- Think this is a ticket home?

37:12.449 --> 37:16.259
- Maybe.
- Shit, I just got here.

37:22.084 --> 37:23.543
Hiya, Cowboy!

37:23.544 --> 37:27.046
Shut your fucking guinea trap,
Gonorrhea.

37:27.047 --> 37:30.466
- He's all right.
- You got a whole Kraut platoon.

37:30.467 --> 37:32.802
- More, captain.
- You need help?

37:32.803 --> 37:36.722
I need ammo, sir!
Lots of it. And TNT!

37:36.723 --> 37:41.899
- I got TNT, sir!
- Good job, private!

37:45.941 --> 37:48.671
Jesus.

37:48.694 --> 37:50.194
Hall! Ready?

37:50.195 --> 37:53.368
I don't have any way
to set it off, sir.

38:10.883 --> 38:14.216
Fire in the hole!

38:17.347 --> 38:23.269
Plesha! Covering fire. Third gun here.
Lorraine, grab more potato mashers...

38:23.270 --> 38:27.888
...and follow me!
Malarkey, Hall, you two. Go!

38:45.876 --> 38:49.337
- Running low on ammo, sir!
- And you, Malarkey?

38:49.338 --> 38:51.505
Okay.

38:51.506 --> 38:56.093
- Got enough to take the third gun?
- We'll see! Malarkey, let's go!

38:56.094 --> 38:58.471
Toye! Cover us!

38:58.472 --> 38:59.847
Okay, Hall.

38:59.848 --> 39:02.225
Keep your head down.

39:02.226 --> 39:06.685
Hall!
Leave your TNT!

39:14.029 --> 39:15.928
Fire in the hole!

39:21.787 --> 39:25.836
Malarkey, cover the front.
Go to the cannon. Go!

39:56.697 --> 39:59.782
I'm looking
for Battalion Headquarters!

39:59.783 --> 40:02.827
Are you kidding?
It's back thataway!

40:02.828 --> 40:05.364
You mean over...?

40:07.249 --> 40:10.343
Fire in the hole!

40:21.805 --> 40:23.848
TNT!

40:23.849 --> 40:26.767
- TNT!
- Don't need it!

40:26.768 --> 40:29.907
- What?
- Don't need it!

40:30.314 --> 40:34.807
- Hall!
- Hall?!

40:35.068 --> 40:38.526
Where'd he come from?

40:40.741 --> 40:43.910
Winters!
Hester said you needed ammo!

40:43.911 --> 40:48.956
Malarkey!
As much as you can for everyone.

40:48.957 --> 40:52.293
Mind if D Company takes
a shot at the next gun?

40:52.294 --> 40:55.379
- All yours!
- Let's go, Dog Company!

40:55.380 --> 40:59.634
- Let's get them, D Company!
- Compton!

40:59.676 --> 41:02.815
- Who is that, Speirs?
- Out! Get out!

41:07.809 --> 41:10.519
What's he doing out of the trench?

41:10.520 --> 41:13.898
- What the hell's he doing?
- Too late!

41:13.899 --> 41:16.708
Oh, Jesus.

41:20.322 --> 41:21.739
Sir!

41:21.740 --> 41:25.949
Had a little trouble getting
through that first field.

41:26.828 --> 41:29.747
- Oh, Christ.
- We need it at the next gun.

41:29.748 --> 41:34.161
- Once it's blown, pull out. Go!
- Yes, sir.

41:35.337 --> 41:41.036
Compton, police them both, then
pull out! Lorraine! Toye! Move out!

41:48.725 --> 41:51.561
Move out! Move out! Move it out!

41:51.562 --> 41:53.256
MGs first.

41:53.814 --> 41:56.649
Fall back to your original positions.

41:56.650 --> 42:00.904
Everyone else,
maintain your base of fire.

42:05.075 --> 42:09.204
Okay! Back to battalion! Go! Go!

42:19.673 --> 42:24.510
They were 105s. We disabled them
and pulled out. There's maybe...

42:24.511 --> 42:28.180
...40 Krauts manning three
MG42s to the rear.

42:28.181 --> 42:30.224
- Hey, Pop.
- Coming through!

42:30.225 --> 42:33.394
- Forty?
- Yes, sir.

42:33.395 --> 42:36.147
We killed maybe
around 20, so...

42:36.148 --> 42:38.816
...probably there's 40 left.

42:38.817 --> 42:43.993
I think we need artillery or maybe
mortars might do the job.

42:56.210 --> 42:59.304
- Going my way?
- Sure.

42:59.546 --> 43:01.631
Sir.

43:01.632 --> 43:05.593
Careful, don't hurt yourself.

43:05.594 --> 43:09.639
- Nice ride you got here, Nix.
- Straight from Utah Beach.

43:09.640 --> 43:13.576
We should put them to work
before they're missed.

43:19.733 --> 43:23.361
2nd Battalion had
secured Sainte-Marie-du-Mont.

43:23.362 --> 43:29.061
Elements of the 4th Division began
to move men and material inland.

43:31.328 --> 43:36.624
The 101st Airborne, including Easy
Company, was scattered over Normandy.

43:36.625 --> 43:42.380
Success of the invasion was uncertain.
We had an hour to rest and find food...

43:42.381 --> 43:47.477
...before we had to move south
and secure the town of Culoville.

43:50.514 --> 43:54.892
- I don't wanna die in this truck.
- You're stepping on my legs!

43:54.893 --> 43:59.355
- Jesus, let me out of here.
- Light. Light discipline.

43:59.356 --> 44:01.524
Guarnere, close that flap.

44:01.525 --> 44:04.937
Let the Krauts cook
their own goddamn food.

44:05.112 --> 44:07.196
- How we doing, Malark?
- Good.

44:07.197 --> 44:08.406
- Good?
- Yeah.

44:08.407 --> 44:10.950
The Irish don't know how to cook.

44:10.951 --> 44:16.205
If you have a reservation someplace
else, I'd be happy to go with you.

44:16.206 --> 44:19.618
- Thank you.
- Shit.

44:24.214 --> 44:27.865
Jesus Christ, give me some air.

44:33.849 --> 44:36.783
Oh, God.

44:36.935 --> 44:39.312
- Evening.
- Hello, sir.

44:39.313 --> 44:44.091
- Something die in here?
- Yeah, Malarkey's ass.

44:45.152 --> 44:49.645
- Any word on Lieutenant Meehan, sir?
- No, not yet.

44:51.742 --> 44:55.161
Don't that make you our
commanding officer, sir?

44:55.162 --> 44:57.380
Yeah, it does.

44:59.750 --> 45:04.243
- Sir.
- Joe, the lieutenant don't drink.

45:06.131 --> 45:09.225
It's been a day of firsts.

45:14.556 --> 45:16.887
Don't you think, Guarnere?

45:19.645 --> 45:22.454
Yes, sir.

45:23.941 --> 45:25.233
Carry on.

45:25.234 --> 45:27.109
- Night, sir.
- Good night.

45:27.110 --> 45:30.321
- Oh, sergeant?
- Sir.

45:30.322 --> 45:33.814
I'm not a Quaker.

45:36.203 --> 45:40.059
- He's probably a Mennonite.
- What's a Mennonite?

45:43.919 --> 45:46.629
Hey!

45:46.630 --> 45:48.506
Dick!

45:48.507 --> 45:53.956
You know that map you found?
It had every Kraut gun in Normandy.

45:55.597 --> 45:58.167
Here.

45:59.268 --> 46:02.144
Don't ever get a cat.

46:02.145 --> 46:04.730
What's on your mind?

46:04.731 --> 46:07.608
I lost a man today.

46:07.609 --> 46:09.235
Hall.

46:09.236 --> 46:13.114
Thanks.
A John Hall. New Yorker.

46:13.115 --> 46:15.783
Got killed today at Brecourt.

46:15.784 --> 46:19.245
- I never knew him.
- Yeah, you did.

46:19.246 --> 46:23.819
Radio op. 506th basketball team,
Able Company.

46:25.085 --> 46:27.253
He was a good man.

46:27.254 --> 46:32.066
Man.
Not even old enough to buy a beer.

46:35.929 --> 46:38.863
Not hungry.

46:39.808 --> 46:42.458
Hey, Dick.

46:42.978 --> 46:45.730
I sent that map up to Division.

46:45.731 --> 46:49.143
I think it's gonna do some good.

47:30.025 --> 47:35.446
That night I thanked God for
seeing me through that day of days.

47:35.447 --> 47:39.656
And prayed I would make
it through D + 1.

47:39.993 --> 47:44.372
And if somehow I managed
to get home again...

47:44.373 --> 47:47.542
...I promised God and myself...

47:47.543 --> 47:51.504
...that I would find
a quiet piece of land someplace...

47:51.505 --> 47:55.839
...and spend
the rest of my life in peace.
