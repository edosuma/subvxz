00:10.148 --> 00:11.631
I'm telling you, okay,

00:11.632 --> 00:13.426
that rich old lady who
lived here died last year.

00:13.427 --> 00:15.014
This place gives me the creeps.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.498
Oh just, come on.

00:16.499 --> 00:18.328
I mean, who knows
what we could find?

00:31.307 --> 00:32.101
Sweet.

00:33.240 --> 00:34.034
Come on.

01:17.318 --> 01:19.838
You know, we could probably...

01:23.152 --> 01:24.014
Trevor?

01:35.440 --> 01:36.716
You jerk.

01:36.717 --> 01:39.098
Ooh, it's what you get.

01:44.828 --> 01:46.416
Someone's downstairs.

01:50.869 --> 01:52.111
Dude.

02:07.575 --> 02:09.129
Go, go, go!

02:41.506 --> 02:42.678
Mac!

02:42.679 --> 02:44.439
Coming!

02:44.440 --> 02:45.268
Hey, thought I was gonna have

02:45.269 --> 02:46.579
to drag you out of bed.

02:46.580 --> 02:47.822
No, I was up late
last night writing.

02:49.272 --> 02:50.686
And yet you still got up
to volunteer for my project.

02:50.687 --> 02:51.654
What a guy!

02:51.655 --> 02:53.172
You told me I had no choice.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.759
True.

02:54.760 --> 02:55.967
But if my dad and I are
gonna finish this project

02:55.968 --> 02:58.177
we have to marshal
all of our resources.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.869
Thank you, by the way, for
delaying the work on your house.

03:00.870 --> 03:01.973
Oh, I don't mind the delay.

03:01.974 --> 03:03.389
I like the little writing pad

03:03.390 --> 03:04.942
and my mostly nice landlady.

03:04.943 --> 03:06.012
Mostly?

03:06.013 --> 03:07.220
You might want to rethink that

03:07.221 --> 03:08.773
if you want a ride
to the Forest house.

03:08.774 --> 03:10.258
Oh, I'm gonna have
to meet you there.

03:10.259 --> 03:11.742
I'm picking up my niece
at the ferry this morning.

03:11.743 --> 03:13.019
That's right. Today's the day.

03:13.020 --> 03:14.469
- Mm-hmm.
- I am all ready.

03:14.470 --> 03:16.816
I have clean sheets on
the bed in the guestroom.

03:16.817 --> 03:18.300
Are you sure about this?

03:18.301 --> 03:19.646
I mean, I have a teenager
in your house for two weeks?

03:19.647 --> 03:21.717
I hear that teenagers
are people, too.

03:21.718 --> 03:24.169
Seriously, I am excited
to get to know her.

03:25.481 --> 03:26.757
Well, I'll bring
Callie by the house then.

03:26.758 --> 03:28.483
Then you can put a
power tool in her hand.

03:28.484 --> 03:30.692
Let's start with a paintbrush.

03:31.521 --> 03:32.453
Yeah.

03:32.454 --> 03:34.143
Better idea. Okay.

03:34.144 --> 03:35.248
- I'll see you there.
- Right.

03:51.092 --> 03:52.852
Wow, look at all the volunteers.

03:52.853 --> 03:53.819
Morning.

03:53.820 --> 03:55.130
Although I still can't believe

03:55.131 --> 03:57.063
that the bank actually
donated this house.

03:57.064 --> 03:58.513
Why do you say that?

03:58.514 --> 04:00.031
The mortgage for my BNB
is with the same bank.

04:00.032 --> 04:03.311
And let's just say I try very
hard not to miss a payment.

04:03.312 --> 04:04.174
Hm.

04:15.772 --> 04:18.258
Oh, this is great.

04:20.156 --> 04:21.674
Hey, Marie.

04:21.675 --> 04:23.779
Shannon. Hello.

04:23.780 --> 04:25.022
The big day is finally here.

04:25.023 --> 04:26.610
We are very excited.

04:26.611 --> 04:28.715
Jen, this is Marie Bishop.

04:28.716 --> 04:31.649
She is the executive director
of Sunnyside Housing.

04:31.650 --> 04:33.306
It was her idea
to turn this house

04:33.307 --> 04:35.204
into apartments for
her low income clients.

04:35.205 --> 04:36.827
Such a great idea.

04:36.828 --> 04:39.623
It will be, if we can
get it done in time.

04:39.624 --> 04:41.867
That's Dave Drummond over there.

04:43.179 --> 04:44.317
I think you met him?

04:44.318 --> 04:46.043
Yeah, the vice
president of the bank.

04:46.044 --> 04:47.147
Yeah, he's checking to see

04:47.148 --> 04:48.632
if the bank president
will show up

04:48.633 --> 04:50.150
for the photo op that I
set up with the newspaper.

04:50.151 --> 04:51.359
That would be great.

04:51.360 --> 04:52.292
More publicity will
mean more volunteers.

04:52.293 --> 04:53.982
That's the idea.

04:53.983 --> 04:55.052
All right, we'll
see you guys inside.

04:55.053 --> 04:55.847
- You bet.
- Pleased to meet you.

04:55.847 --> 04:56.675
You too.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.815
So what did she mean?

04:59.816 --> 05:00.748
If you pull it off.

05:02.163 --> 05:04.164
Donation to nonprofits,
come with conditions.

05:04.165 --> 05:05.476
The condition on this one is,

05:05.477 --> 05:08.030
it has to be done in a
three month timeframe.

05:08.031 --> 05:10.309
Otherwise the house
reverts back to the bank.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.587
Shannon, that
isn't a lot of time.

05:12.588 --> 05:13.589
We'll get it done.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.005
So is Mr. Potter coming?

05:17.006 --> 05:19.490
Yeah, Patrice said she
put it on his calendar

05:19.491 --> 05:21.492
and he didn't say
he's not coming.

05:21.493 --> 05:23.322
That doesn't sound promising.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.978
Well, he lost the vote.

05:24.979 --> 05:28.224
Board approved the donation
and he needs to get over it.

05:46.898 --> 05:49.037
Uncle Mac!

05:49.038 --> 05:50.971
Callie! Look at you!

05:52.421 --> 05:54.422
You're like a foot taller
than when I saw you last.

05:54.423 --> 05:55.802
Well, at least an inch anyway.

05:55.803 --> 05:57.563
Yeah, how was that ferry ride?

05:57.564 --> 05:58.771
Thrilling.

05:58.772 --> 06:00.048
Oh, well say goodbye
to those thrills.

06:00.049 --> 06:01.601
I'm putting you to work
for the next two weeks.

06:01.602 --> 06:02.431
On what?

06:02.431 --> 06:03.293
Well, you'll see.

06:07.953 --> 06:09.265
Oh, there you are. Just.

06:10.611 --> 06:12.923
So all these people keep
asking me where they should go

06:12.924 --> 06:15.097
and I have no idea
what to tell them.

06:15.098 --> 06:15.927
Oh.

06:15.928 --> 06:17.168
Hi, hi, Sean.

06:17.169 --> 06:17.998
Jennifer, hey.

06:17.998 --> 06:18.895
Hey.

06:18.895 --> 06:19.724
Wow, it's, it's been awhile.

06:19.725 --> 06:21.690
Mm-hmm, yeah.

06:21.691 --> 06:24.244
Hope you're okay getting a
little paint on that outfit.

06:24.245 --> 06:25.832
Oh, little, little
splash of color.

06:25.833 --> 06:29.905
Might brighten things up.
You know, so.

06:29.906 --> 06:32.840
So do any of these people
know what they're doing or?

06:33.979 --> 06:35.186
Well, if they don't,
we can teach them.

06:35.187 --> 06:37.085
I taught you, didn't I?

06:37.086 --> 06:39.190
Dad, I thought it would have
Jen start a sign up sheet.

06:39.191 --> 06:41.089
She could get people's
contact information

06:41.090 --> 06:43.160
and then see if they have
any skills that we could use.

06:43.161 --> 06:44.644
Good idea.

06:44.645 --> 06:47.129
Sean, grab a couple of boys
and unload the supplies, okay?

06:47.130 --> 06:48.994
We'll set up a
command center inside.

06:50.340 --> 06:51.169
Yes, sir.

06:52.688 --> 06:55.793
Hm, I always thought
Sean was kind of cute.

06:59.280 --> 07:00.316
Okay.

07:01.282 --> 07:02.282
Alright everyone.

07:02.283 --> 07:03.422
Can I get a line
up of volunteers

07:03.423 --> 07:05.769
along the wall here, please?

07:05.770 --> 07:06.702
Good morning.

07:15.745 --> 07:17.919
What a turnout, huh?

07:17.920 --> 07:19.507
Yeah, it's good to
see people pitching in

07:19.508 --> 07:21.336
for a good cause.

07:21.337 --> 07:23.581
Oh my gosh, you're him!
Maclntyre Sullivan.

07:24.547 --> 07:26.548
Wow, I finally get to meet you.

07:26.549 --> 07:28.205
Hi, I'm Whitney Sloane.

07:28.206 --> 07:29.206
I own Beacon Books.

07:29.207 --> 07:31.104
Oh, yeah, love that place.

07:31.105 --> 07:32.485
This is my niece, Callie.

07:32.486 --> 07:33.349
Hello.

07:33.350 --> 07:34.798
Hi.

07:34.799 --> 07:37.041
Now Sloan, any relation to Tommy
Sloane, the police officer?

07:37.042 --> 07:39.388
Yeah, he's my brother.

07:39.389 --> 07:40.976
He's said that he knows you

07:40.977 --> 07:42.599
and I've been bugging him to ask

07:42.600 --> 07:44.464
if you'd do a
signing at my shop.

07:45.603 --> 07:47.432
Well, now you can
bug me yourself.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.159
Shall we? Come on.

07:57.546 --> 08:00.168
So we'll use our guys to frame
in the walls here and here.

08:00.169 --> 08:02.758
And then we'll use volunteers
to hang the Sheetrock.

08:03.897 --> 08:05.899
It's gonna take a
lot of quality control.

08:08.177 --> 08:09.660
Hey there, Marie.

08:09.661 --> 08:11.904
I want to introduce you
to one of our families.

08:11.905 --> 08:14.009
This is Jim Hopkins
and his son Elliot.

08:14.010 --> 08:15.252
Hey.

08:15.253 --> 08:16.047
They're slated to get
one of the apartments

08:16.048 --> 08:17.530
when you're done.

08:17.531 --> 08:18.945
Yes, and I'm told none
of this would be possible

08:18.946 --> 08:21.016
if you two didn't
volunteer and take charge.

08:21.017 --> 08:22.639
So thank you.

08:22.640 --> 08:24.399
Happy to help.

08:24.400 --> 08:27.264
This will be the first home
of their own and over a year.

08:27.265 --> 08:31.130
Yes, I lost my job when
the cement plant shut down.

08:31.131 --> 08:34.927
It hasn't been easy, but
with all this going on,

08:34.928 --> 08:37.136
it looks like things
are looking up.

08:37.137 --> 08:39.310
So Elliot, are you gonna
help with the renovation?

08:39.311 --> 08:40.415
Ah, yeah.

08:40.416 --> 08:41.623
Oh, well, don't like sleeping

08:41.624 --> 08:43.349
on my cousin's couch
too much, so.

08:43.350 --> 08:44.902
Well, in return
for your hard work,

08:44.903 --> 08:47.836
you and your dad could pick out
the apartment you like best.

08:47.837 --> 08:49.286
Yeah.

08:49.287 --> 08:50.529
Oh, the newspaper
people should be here now.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.116
So come on, Elliot.

08:52.117 --> 08:54.153
Let's go say cheese
for the cameras.

08:55.224 --> 08:56.363
- Okay.
- Picture time.

09:00.263 --> 09:02.023
Hey, Mac, you are just in time

09:02.024 --> 09:04.543
to be memorialized in
The Lighthouse Cove News.

09:04.544 --> 09:05.751
Wow.

09:05.752 --> 09:07.684
You must be Callie.

09:07.685 --> 09:09.064
Pleased meet you.

09:09.065 --> 09:10.411
Very pleased to meet you.

09:12.310 --> 09:14.449
Okay, everyone, come on in.

09:14.450 --> 09:16.865
Come on, we're gonna
do the photo, everyone.

09:16.866 --> 09:19.109
- Yep.
- Come on in, nice and close.

09:19.110 --> 09:21.767
Okay, everyone,
squeeze together.

09:21.768 --> 09:23.907
Okay, come on, come on.

09:23.908 --> 09:25.391
Get in there.

09:25.392 --> 09:27.774
Okay, everyone get in,
sort of squeeze together.

09:34.194 --> 09:35.228
Wait.

09:38.785 --> 09:41.614
Ah, so Charles deigned
to show his face after all.

09:41.615 --> 09:42.926
Mr. Potter, Patrice.

09:42.927 --> 09:45.100
So glad you could make it.

09:45.101 --> 09:46.068
Wouldn't miss it.

09:47.621 --> 09:48.588
Everyone, make room

09:48.589 --> 09:50.003
for the president of the bank.

09:56.112 --> 09:56.941
Oh.

09:57.907 --> 10:00.357
Okay, everybody, smile.

10:02.843 --> 10:05.534
Okay, we're splitting up
the volunteer assignments

10:05.535 --> 10:08.917
between those that require
expertise and those that don't.

10:08.918 --> 10:10.229
Terrific, I'll take
these to Jennifer.

10:10.230 --> 10:11.679
In a few minutes

10:11.680 --> 10:14.336
you'll be hearing the sweet
sounds of construction.

10:14.337 --> 10:15.786
Thanks, Dad.

10:15.787 --> 10:17.546
Now, Mr.
Potter, my sources tell me

10:17.547 --> 10:19.618
you oppose this donation.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.205
I make no apologies for that.

10:21.206 --> 10:23.622
It's my job to ensure
a profit for the bank.

10:23.623 --> 10:26.107
It's also my job to
carry out the wishes

10:26.108 --> 10:27.695
of my board of directors.

10:27.696 --> 10:30.352
And so I will be keeping
an eye on the renovation

10:30.353 --> 10:32.666
and making sure the
donation is used properly.

10:34.150 --> 10:35.910
I have just
one more question though,

10:35.911 --> 10:36.945
about the project.

10:36.946 --> 10:38.257
And I understand
from my sources...

10:38.258 --> 10:39.638
I'm guessing he's
the one that came up

10:39.639 --> 10:41.812
with the three month deadline.

10:41.813 --> 10:43.365
Good guess.

10:43.366 --> 10:44.677
I should get back to the bank.

10:44.678 --> 10:46.161
Let me know if there's
anything else I can do

10:46.162 --> 10:48.578
to help move the project along.

10:49.718 --> 10:51.512
Thanks, Dave.
You've been awesome.

10:53.135 --> 10:56.620
So what is my work
assignment for today?

10:56.621 --> 10:58.139
First thing you
can go to my truck

10:58.140 --> 11:01.349
and in the back, you'll find
an extra pair of work boots.

11:01.350 --> 11:04.524
Okay, well
how about I handle lunch?

11:04.525 --> 11:05.354
That would be great.

11:05.354 --> 11:06.182
Okay.

11:07.149 --> 11:08.667
Oh, great, you're a plumber.

11:08.668 --> 11:09.909
You're gonna be joining
the crew in the basement.

11:09.910 --> 11:11.462
Thank you.

11:11.463 --> 11:13.154
Hello ladies.

11:13.155 --> 11:15.674
I'm gonna have you sanding
cabinets in the kitchen.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.192
Thanks very much.

11:17.193 --> 11:18.849
Hey Andy, how's it going?

11:18.850 --> 11:20.679
You're up painting in
the master bedroom.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.163
Thanks.

11:22.164 --> 11:24.856
Aren't you worried that that
one is a spy for Mr. Potter?

11:26.789 --> 11:27.721
Who, Patrice?

11:31.621 --> 11:32.829
Hi there.

11:32.830 --> 11:33.796
I'm gonna have you
offloading supplies

11:33.797 --> 11:36.142
just at the side of the house.

11:36.143 --> 11:39.214
You just know she's the one
that writes those letters,

11:39.215 --> 11:41.182
the ones that make you
feel like they're about

11:41.183 --> 11:43.736
to snatch your
purse away from you.

11:43.737 --> 11:45.117
I'm gonna get you
in the cleanup crew.

11:45.118 --> 11:46.497
It's on the third floor.

11:46.498 --> 11:49.259
So I'm guessing that
you have a mortgage

11:49.260 --> 11:50.536
with this bank, also?

11:50.537 --> 11:51.744
My bookstore.

11:51.745 --> 11:53.573
Recently, I tried to refinance,

11:53.574 --> 11:56.369
but even though the loan
officer approved it,

11:56.370 --> 11:57.958
Potter shot it down.

11:58.959 --> 12:00.408
Oh, he's a
micromanager, all right.

12:00.409 --> 12:01.478
He's worse than that.

12:01.479 --> 12:02.722
He is... Donut?

12:07.174 --> 12:08.830
Look at that, my fave.

12:08.831 --> 12:10.176
Well, I wanted to make
sure you both got one

12:10.177 --> 12:11.178
before they're gone.

12:13.525 --> 12:14.354
So good.

12:16.321 --> 12:19.116
Looks like someone
took a saw to this.

12:19.117 --> 12:21.187
I worked 25 years at my job.

12:21.188 --> 12:22.706
And?

12:22.707 --> 12:25.157
It's not my fault
the cement plant shut down.

12:25.158 --> 12:26.779
It's not my problem.

12:26.780 --> 12:28.022
What kind of a man are you?

12:28.023 --> 12:29.023
The kind of man

12:29.024 --> 12:30.818
who doesn't rely
on the handouts?

12:38.309 --> 12:40.724
Excuse me, is everything okay?

12:40.725 --> 12:42.761
Are you in charge
of this renovation?

12:42.762 --> 12:44.038
Yeah, my dad and I.

12:44.039 --> 12:45.764
If that's the quality
of help you have,

12:45.765 --> 12:47.455
I'd be worried about
making your deadline.

12:47.456 --> 12:49.837
I'm sorry, Mr. Potter,
but is there a problem?

12:49.838 --> 12:52.391
I just saw one of our
clients looking very upset.

12:52.392 --> 12:54.911
Ms. Bishop, I've been
wanting to talk to you.

12:54.912 --> 12:57.430
I have reason to believe
that Dave Drummond duped

12:57.431 --> 13:01.021
our board of directors into
approving this donation.

13:02.436 --> 13:04.784
You can't be serious.

13:06.302 --> 13:08.821
Are you saying, you
know nothing about it?

13:08.822 --> 13:11.617
I'm saying that
you must be mistaken.

13:11.618 --> 13:13.239
And what about you?

13:13.240 --> 13:15.724
Did Drummond offer you
something to stay quiet.

13:15.725 --> 13:17.519
Stay quiet about what?

13:17.520 --> 13:20.419
Mr. Potter, I don't know
what you think is happening,

13:20.420 --> 13:23.698
but Shannon has volunteered
her time and her expertise...

13:23.699 --> 13:26.011
Most volunteers I know
ladle soup in the kitchen.

13:26.012 --> 13:28.703
They don't work
gratis for months.

13:28.704 --> 13:31.326
Unless they expect to
get something in return.

13:31.327 --> 13:32.603
Well, what I get in return

13:32.604 --> 13:35.917
is the satisfaction
of helping people.

13:35.918 --> 13:38.024
Well, for your sake,
I hope that's true.

13:42.994 --> 13:43.823
Wow.

13:45.514 --> 13:48.102
I hope this hasn't made you
rethink taking on this project.

13:48.103 --> 13:49.758
No, no. Don't worry about it.

13:49.759 --> 13:51.830
I am not easily intimidated,

13:51.831 --> 13:54.281
but that guy is riled
up about something.

13:56.939 --> 13:59.113
There you go, third floor.

13:59.114 --> 14:01.770
Sean, wow, this
place looks great.

14:01.771 --> 14:04.152
It's amazing how fast
you get all those together.

14:04.153 --> 14:05.016
That's 'cause I've
had a little help

14:05.017 --> 14:06.292
from my new supply crew.

14:06.293 --> 14:10.089
I was wondering,
is this a real job

14:10.090 --> 14:12.229
or just very sick kids?

14:12.230 --> 14:16.268
Well, this is actually the
hub of the entire operation.

14:16.269 --> 14:18.408
Hey, just letting you
know I'm leaving now.

14:18.409 --> 14:20.099
This is for you, my card,

14:20.100 --> 14:22.205
if you want to set
up that book signing.

14:22.206 --> 14:23.689
You should do it, Uncle Mac.

14:23.690 --> 14:26.243
Never been to one of your
books signings before.

14:26.244 --> 14:27.762
Ah, thanks.

14:27.763 --> 14:29.039
Yeah, I'll pick a date and
I'll, I'll give you a call.

14:29.040 --> 14:30.420
Great.

14:32.664 --> 14:33.941
You mean I could get a chance

14:33.942 --> 14:37.254
to stand in line and
get your autograph.

14:37.255 --> 14:38.635
You're making fun of me.

14:38.636 --> 14:40.430
No. Yes.

14:40.431 --> 14:41.363
A little.

14:47.853 --> 14:49.405
And, this is your room.

14:51.511 --> 14:52.994
And your uncle is right out back

14:52.995 --> 14:54.444
if you need to talk to him.

14:54.445 --> 14:55.377
Or I can just text him.

14:55.378 --> 14:58.206
He writes pretty funny texts.

14:58.207 --> 15:00.415
He does write funny texts.

15:00.416 --> 15:02.866
He's really happy
that you're here.

15:02.867 --> 15:05.213
I missed him, like, so much.

15:05.214 --> 15:07.112
I wish he hadn't moved away.

15:07.113 --> 15:09.459
But I guess I don't blame
him after all that drama

15:09.460 --> 15:11.117
from him calling
off the wedding.

15:12.601 --> 15:14.636
Bathroom's down that way, right?

15:14.637 --> 15:17.260
Mac, he was engaged?

15:17.261 --> 15:18.331
Thought you knew.

15:19.504 --> 15:20.816
Pretend I didn't say that.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.476
He was engaged.

15:36.452 --> 15:37.281
What?

15:40.353 --> 15:41.525
This seriously may be one

15:41.526 --> 15:43.389
of the prettiest
places I've ever been.

15:43.390 --> 15:45.081
Wait to see the house
that your uncle bought.

15:45.082 --> 15:46.323
It's right on the water.

15:46.324 --> 15:47.946
Shannon's renovating
that one too.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.637
Although he
doesn't make it easy.

15:49.638 --> 15:51.708
Always adding changes
that he wants.

15:51.709 --> 15:53.365
He's a very demanding client.

15:53.366 --> 15:55.850
I think the words you're
looking for is discriminating.

15:55.851 --> 15:57.748
No, that's not
the word I'm looking for.

15:59.234 --> 16:01.821
I propose a toast to Callie's
arrival in Lighthouse Cove.

16:01.822 --> 16:02.651
To Callie.

16:05.274 --> 16:06.103
Excuse me.

16:09.244 --> 16:10.072
What?

16:10.073 --> 16:11.590
What's up?

16:11.591 --> 16:13.109
Some tiles we
need first thing tomorrow

16:13.110 --> 16:15.732
didn't make the
delivery truck today.

16:15.733 --> 16:17.182
I better text Sean.

16:17.183 --> 16:19.701
See if he can help me get
them to the job site tonight.

16:19.702 --> 16:21.393
Well, uncle Mac,
you can help her.

16:21.394 --> 16:23.498
No, it's your first night here.

16:23.499 --> 16:24.431
It's not a big deal.

16:24.432 --> 16:26.329
Yeah, I'm gonna hang with you.

16:26.330 --> 16:28.434
Well, my favorite
show is on tonight, so...

16:28.435 --> 16:29.884
I'll watch it with you.

16:29.885 --> 16:31.955
I'm not gonna leave you
alone in an unfamiliar place.

16:31.956 --> 16:33.301
I don't need a babysitter.

16:33.302 --> 16:34.476
I'm almost 15.

16:36.409 --> 16:37.479
That is pretty old.

16:39.136 --> 16:40.723
So then you can help Shannon.

16:45.073 --> 16:46.384
Apparently it's settled.

16:47.937 --> 16:50.215
Well then I propose
another toast to Callie.

16:50.216 --> 16:51.562
I think that's good idea.

17:15.931 --> 17:17.760
I wonder who that was?

17:23.456 --> 17:25.353
Nice of someone to leave
the light on in the garage.

17:25.354 --> 17:26.872
The garage should
be locked up tight.

17:26.873 --> 17:28.874
Sean wouldn't have
left it open like that.

17:28.875 --> 17:31.084
Well maybe he came back
to get some work done.

17:33.086 --> 17:34.812
Something isn't right.

17:50.966 --> 17:51.794
On no!

17:54.003 --> 17:56.040
That's Charles Potter,
the bank president.

18:05.118 --> 18:06.739
I can't find a pulse.

18:31.800 --> 18:33.801
Okay, you said you saw
pickup parked out front

18:33.802 --> 18:35.285
when you arrived?

18:35.286 --> 18:37.494
Yeah, a Ford. It pulled
away as soon as we got here.

18:37.495 --> 18:40.118
I'm pretty sure it was
blue with a white hate top,

18:40.119 --> 18:41.120
like an older model.

18:42.259 --> 18:43.777
Any idea who it belonged to?

18:44.813 --> 18:46.089
No.

18:46.090 --> 18:48.091
And you don't know why
Potter was here tonight

18:48.092 --> 18:49.644
or who else might've
been here with him?

18:49.645 --> 18:51.646
No, but when he was
here earlier today,

18:51.647 --> 18:54.304
he rubbed a lot of
people the wrong way.

18:54.305 --> 18:55.134
Like who?

18:55.135 --> 18:56.169
Me, for one.

18:57.515 --> 19:00.310
Marie Bishop, the
director of the nonprofit,

19:00.311 --> 19:03.279
he had words with one of
the volunteers, Jim Hopkins.

19:03.280 --> 19:05.660
Well, the coroner's
pretty sure we're looking

19:05.661 --> 19:08.767
at the cause of death as blunt
force trauma to the head.

19:08.768 --> 19:10.527
Could it have been
with a crescent wrench?

19:10.528 --> 19:12.288
Why would you say that?

19:12.289 --> 19:15.154
While we were waiting I
noticed one of ours is missing.

19:16.293 --> 19:17.362
That peg is empty.

19:17.363 --> 19:18.880
When I left work earlier today,

19:18.881 --> 19:20.710
there was a crescent
wrench hanging from it,

19:20.711 --> 19:22.471
a black and red grip.

19:23.679 --> 19:26.716
Oh, tell him what
else you noticed.

19:26.717 --> 19:28.235
The hem of Potter's pants.

19:28.236 --> 19:31.307
If you look along the bottom,
there's darker stains.

19:31.308 --> 19:34.033
They're fading now, but they
were darker when we got here.

19:34.034 --> 19:35.242
Yeah, it looked to us

19:35.243 --> 19:36.416
like the bottom of
his pants were wet.

19:48.808 --> 19:51.742
Well, it's faint, but I see
it now that you point it out.

19:53.122 --> 19:56.297
You make sure Ed gets a
picture before dries anymore.

19:56.298 --> 19:58.713
I took a picture right
after I called you guys,

19:58.714 --> 19:59.715
if you want.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.396
Callie's sound asleep.

20:26.397 --> 20:29.020
Good. That means
she's comfortable.

20:31.954 --> 20:32.748
You okay?

20:34.405 --> 20:36.200
I don't understand.

20:38.789 --> 20:39.583
Yeah.

20:40.687 --> 20:42.240
I mean the years
I covered crime,

20:42.241 --> 20:44.587
I could never come up with
a satisfactory explanation

20:44.588 --> 20:47.625
for why murder
happened so often.

20:49.662 --> 20:52.560
I guess that's why I feel
compelled to write about it.

20:52.561 --> 20:54.114
To try and make sense of it.

20:56.013 --> 20:58.117
I think it's just hitting me.

20:58.118 --> 21:00.154
A guy that I talked
to just hours ago,

21:00.155 --> 21:03.261
murdered in such
a way brutal way.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.503
That's not an image

21:04.504 --> 21:06.919
I'm gonna get out of
my mind anytime soon.

21:06.920 --> 21:08.576
What?

21:08.577 --> 21:10.510
Someone you know was murdered?

21:13.237 --> 21:17.827
Here, hot cocoa, it'll
make you feel sleepy again.

21:17.828 --> 21:19.035
Thanks, Uncle Mac.

21:19.036 --> 21:20.795
But I don't need
that to fall asleep.

21:20.796 --> 21:21.866
I'm not a little kid.

21:22.729 --> 21:24.212
Oh, well, more for me then.

21:24.213 --> 21:25.870
I'll drink it 'cause I like it.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.394
I can't believe someone
was killed in that house,

21:33.395 --> 21:35.534
practically right
where I was standing.

21:35.535 --> 21:37.606
I'm sorry you had
to find out like this.

21:40.437 --> 21:42.921
Do you think the killer
was someone you know?

21:42.922 --> 21:45.304
Let's say no more
questions for tonight, okay?

21:46.684 --> 21:50.273
You know, when I was
young and would worry,

21:50.274 --> 21:52.724
my mom would tell me that
if I would quiet my mind

21:52.725 --> 21:55.899
and listen really
well that I could hear

21:55.900 --> 21:57.763
all of the good
things in the world

21:57.764 --> 21:59.696
and that they
outweighed the bad.

22:11.606 --> 22:12.538
There's a lot of people...

22:12.539 --> 22:13.607
Dad, the project is resuming.

22:13.608 --> 22:15.056
- We'll let you know.
- Okay.

22:15.057 --> 22:16.126
Thanks for volunteering.

22:16.127 --> 22:17.335
- Okay. Take care.
- Bye.

22:17.336 --> 22:18.784
Well, that's the
second volunteer

22:18.785 --> 22:20.993
that's had a terrible
story about Charles Potter.

22:20.994 --> 22:23.100
I'm getting the
strangest reactions too.

22:24.481 --> 22:25.964
We should write down what
people are telling us.

22:25.965 --> 22:28.415
Maybe one of the stories will
lead to her killed Potter.

22:28.416 --> 22:31.003
Or maybe you could
leave that to the police.

22:31.004 --> 22:32.246
Dad, hi.

22:32.247 --> 22:35.042
What I meant was that
I would be passing

22:35.043 --> 22:37.113
these stories along to Tommy.

22:37.114 --> 22:39.909
It's his job to
collect them. Not yours.

22:39.910 --> 22:41.117
You start asking questions

22:41.118 --> 22:42.429
to someone who happens
to be the killer,

22:42.430 --> 22:43.465
what happens to then?

22:45.053 --> 22:46.605
You find the killer.

22:46.606 --> 22:49.815
Yeah, but it's kind of like
putting a target on yourself.

22:49.816 --> 22:51.507
Last time you were
curious about a murder,

22:51.508 --> 22:52.888
you put your life in danger.

22:54.165 --> 22:56.167
Promise me you'll let
the police handle this.

22:57.583 --> 23:00.033
Come on, Shannon, you don't
want your dad worry, do ya?

23:01.897 --> 23:02.864
No, I don't.

23:04.279 --> 23:07.731
I promise that I leave the
question asking to the police.

23:08.766 --> 23:09.973
Thank you.

23:09.974 --> 23:12.493
I'm gonna go pick up
the hoist for tomorrow.

23:12.494 --> 23:13.357
Okay.

23:14.738 --> 23:17.015
Jennifer, maybe we could
go grab a bite to eat,

23:17.016 --> 23:18.811
go to a movie sometime.

23:20.295 --> 23:23.159
Sure, a movie sounds great.

23:23.160 --> 23:24.367
Okay.

23:24.368 --> 23:26.852
- Yeah, bye.
- See ya.

23:26.853 --> 23:29.890
A totally think he
just asked you on a date.

23:29.891 --> 23:31.961
I think that you might be right.

23:31.962 --> 23:33.169
So listen, tell me,

23:33.170 --> 23:35.344
why haven't you Mac
ever gone to the movies?

23:36.829 --> 23:41.764
Oh, we, uh, neither of us
are in dating mode right now.

23:41.765 --> 23:45.077
Okay, but you've gone for
dinner a few time, right?

23:45.078 --> 23:46.424
You consider that a date?

23:46.425 --> 23:47.804
Yes.

23:47.805 --> 23:49.427
I don't know.

23:49.428 --> 23:50.738
We made this agreement

23:50.739 --> 23:53.431
that both of us are
fine just being friends.

23:53.432 --> 23:54.847
- So.
- Mm-hmm.

23:55.744 --> 23:56.573
Sure.

23:56.574 --> 23:57.987
Okay.

23:57.988 --> 23:59.264
What's next?

24:02.164 --> 24:04.372
A week from Friday looks good.

24:04.373 --> 24:06.029
That'll be something fun
for Callie's last night.

24:06.030 --> 24:07.686
Wonderful.

24:07.687 --> 24:09.654
I am sure that you'll
get a great turnout.

24:09.655 --> 24:11.276
So many people have
heard that you live here

24:11.277 --> 24:12.588
and they've all been
asking about you.

24:12.589 --> 24:14.279
Now they finally
get to meet you.

24:14.280 --> 24:16.524
Well, I'm about to put
you in such a good mood.

24:17.490 --> 24:19.457
Sounds awful doesn't it,

24:19.458 --> 24:22.633
to be in such a good mood
when Charles Potter is dead.

24:23.807 --> 24:26.187
I mean, it's awful
he was murdered,

24:26.188 --> 24:28.051
but I can't help
but be relieved.

24:28.052 --> 24:30.468
He won't be making my
life so difficult anymore.

24:30.469 --> 24:33.471
And I'm sure I'm
not the only one.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.783
You know, someone who
might've wanted him, uh...

24:35.784 --> 24:38.269
My uncle would like to buy
these books for me please.

24:39.650 --> 24:41.686
I mean, you always say books
are a worthy investment.

24:41.687 --> 24:43.204
I do say that.

24:43.205 --> 24:45.690
Well, I can tell you all the
great reading spots in town.

24:45.691 --> 24:49.383
Although, the best one by
far is at Rocky Point Park.

24:49.384 --> 24:51.489
There's a bench that
overlooks the water

24:51.490 --> 24:53.249
and it's so quiet and peaceful.

24:53.250 --> 24:56.148
It's the best spot ever
to escape from the world.

24:56.149 --> 24:57.565
Thanks, we'll check it out.

25:00.326 --> 25:01.983
Great choices.

25:03.502 --> 25:04.536
Yes. Thank you.

25:04.537 --> 25:05.606
We really appreciate it.

25:05.607 --> 25:07.470
Alright, bye.

25:07.471 --> 25:09.023
Alright. Who is next?

25:09.024 --> 25:10.508
Well, we just have a few more,

25:10.509 --> 25:11.957
but I mean, I can't, I
can't read their writing.

25:11.958 --> 25:14.132
Is that a five or
is that a three?

25:18.344 --> 25:19.827
That's it?

25:19.828 --> 25:21.692
That is the blue truck we
saw leaving here last night

25:22.797 --> 25:24.867
just before we
found Potter's body.

25:24.868 --> 25:26.663
Wait, so what, you think
that that could be his killer?

25:36.673 --> 25:37.536
Shannon.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.679
So Charles Potter was
killed here last night.

25:43.680 --> 25:45.335
As in like right here.

25:45.336 --> 25:48.649
Well, out back by
the garage, but yes.

25:48.650 --> 25:49.892
Wow.

25:49.893 --> 25:50.825
That's terrible.

25:52.481 --> 25:55.587
I mean, look, I didn't
exactly like him. Right?

25:55.588 --> 25:57.693
But you heard him,

25:57.694 --> 26:00.455
how he implied a real man
wouldn't take a handout.

26:01.732 --> 26:03.837
I didn't hear what
he was saying to you,

26:03.838 --> 26:05.804
but I did hear

26:05.805 --> 26:08.152
somebody saw your truck
parked here last night.

26:10.810 --> 26:12.743
Well, yeah, it
was me and Elliot.

26:14.227 --> 26:16.678
We, uh, came by to take a
look at our future house,

26:18.335 --> 26:22.546
parked awhile, talked, made
plans for the new place.

26:23.616 --> 26:25.066
Did you see anybody come or go?

26:27.068 --> 26:28.587
No, nobody.

26:30.071 --> 26:31.589
Hey, if we're not gonna work
today, I'm gonna get going.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.315
So let me know if you need me.

26:36.629 --> 26:38.181
Hey, well, we don't
have your number.

26:38.182 --> 26:39.011
Bishop has it.

26:46.087 --> 26:47.605
He's definitely in a
hurry to get out of here.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.572
Shannon, you definitely
just broke your promise

26:49.573 --> 26:51.505
to your dad asking Jim
all those questions.

26:51.506 --> 26:54.301
I know. You know
me, I cannot help it.

26:54.302 --> 26:56.544
Shannon, what if
he is the killer?

26:56.545 --> 26:59.031
He's probably gonna figure
out that you were the witness.

27:00.446 --> 27:01.723
Oh good, it's Tommy.

27:08.799 --> 27:10.731
Hey Tommy, you gotta go
catch up with Jim Hopkins-

27:10.732 --> 27:12.630
That's exactly who I'm looking for.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.114
After you told us he
had words with Potter,

27:14.115 --> 27:15.633
I ran a background check.

27:15.634 --> 27:18.394
He's got a record in his DMV
printout shows that he drives...

27:18.395 --> 27:20.430
A blue truck.
He was just here.

27:20.431 --> 27:22.950
He admitted that he
was here last night.

27:22.951 --> 27:24.503
He went that way.

27:28.439 --> 27:29.992
Just hate to think
that a single father

27:29.993 --> 27:33.202
who has to take care of a
kid would commit murder.

27:33.203 --> 27:34.514
I know, me too.

27:37.103 --> 27:40.002
Hey, do you think it would be
breaking my promise to my dad

27:40.003 --> 27:43.281
if I tried to find out why
Jim Hopkins has a record?

27:43.282 --> 27:44.214
I guess not.

27:45.560 --> 27:47.492
What if I asked Marie Bishop

27:47.493 --> 27:50.391
how Jim Hopkins became a
client of Sunnyside Housing.

27:50.392 --> 27:53.119
Okay, that would definitely
be breaking your promise.

27:54.396 --> 27:55.294
You're probably right.

27:55.294 --> 27:56.122
Yeah.

27:57.468 --> 27:58.711
What if you ask for me?

28:01.265 --> 28:02.888
Shannon? No.

28:04.717 --> 28:07.168
And don't think you'll be able
to talk me into it this time.

28:12.207 --> 28:13.621
How does she do it?

28:13.622 --> 28:16.003
How does she talk
me into these thing?

28:16.004 --> 28:17.246
Dave, Dave, stop!

28:17.247 --> 28:18.800
This conversation
is not finished.

28:19.939 --> 28:22.700
You can't just pretend
it didn't happen.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.426
What did you
expect me to do. Hm?

28:43.411 --> 28:46.344
Shannon, been
wondering where were.

28:46.345 --> 28:47.932
At the Forest House,
waiting for my dad

28:47.933 --> 28:49.623
to drop a hoist off.

28:49.624 --> 28:50.866
You wouldn't happen

28:50.867 --> 28:52.971
to be near a computer
right now, would you?

28:52.972 --> 28:54.904
Yeah, just trying to
squeeze out a few paragraphs

28:54.905 --> 28:55.837
while I wait for Callie.

28:55.838 --> 28:57.320
Running to the park in a bit.

28:57.321 --> 28:59.633
Good, so tell me, how would you,

28:59.634 --> 29:01.635
as an investigative reporter

29:01.636 --> 29:04.258
find out someone's
prior convictions?

29:04.259 --> 29:07.124
Well, I'd probably do a
quick search of public records.

29:09.023 --> 29:10.299
What's his name?

29:10.300 --> 29:12.992
Jim Hopkins.
Probably James Hopkins.

29:14.407 --> 29:16.616
James Hopkins.

29:18.135 --> 29:19.308
Give it a sec.

29:19.309 --> 29:20.585
Even in the internet age,

29:20.586 --> 29:23.830
it takes some time to
pry open a man secrets.

29:23.831 --> 29:27.454
Hm, maybe I should have conducted
an online search on you.

29:27.455 --> 29:30.181
Me? You I have secrets?

29:30.182 --> 29:32.873
I don't know. Do you?

29:32.874 --> 29:35.703
Ah, search results coming in.

29:35.704 --> 29:38.603
So Jim Hopkins, is he a suspect?

29:38.604 --> 29:40.191
He showed up here
in the blue truck

29:40.192 --> 29:41.779
that we saw last night.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.401
Tommy says he has a record.

29:43.402 --> 29:44.678
He does.

29:44.679 --> 29:46.956
He's a, was convicted
for grand theft auto,

29:46.957 --> 29:48.407
Mathis County, July, 1997.

29:49.339 --> 29:50.477
20 years ago.

29:50.478 --> 29:53.376
So nothing else,
nothing violent.

29:53.377 --> 29:54.654
That's all it comes up.

29:55.828 --> 29:57.070
Okay. Thanks.

29:57.071 --> 29:58.623
Hey, gotta go
before my dad thinks

29:58.624 --> 30:00.212
I'm putting a target on my back.

30:02.110 --> 30:03.077
Target?

30:03.078 --> 30:05.734
Hey, what are you.

30:09.359 --> 30:10.669
Ready to go?

30:10.670 --> 30:11.499
Yep.

30:17.125 --> 30:19.438
Okay, gently,
slide her down, slowly.

30:20.335 --> 30:21.164
That's it.

30:22.786 --> 30:23.924
There you go.

30:23.925 --> 30:25.201
Thanks, Sean.

30:25.202 --> 30:26.547
Thank you.

30:26.548 --> 30:27.825
We can get it the
rest of the way.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.034
Oh, almost forgot.

30:30.035 --> 30:31.036
Have a look at this.

30:32.209 --> 30:33.934
I was finishing the
paperwork for the county

30:33.935 --> 30:36.662
and took another
look at the appraisal

30:38.112 --> 30:40.872
and I thought this can't be
the appraisal for this house.

30:40.873 --> 30:43.047
Maybe they gave
us the wrong one.

30:43.048 --> 30:44.358
It's the right address.

30:44.359 --> 30:46.671
Yeah, but look at
the appraisal value.

30:46.672 --> 30:48.500
Yeah, that can't be
right. It's too low.

30:48.501 --> 30:51.020
This house is worth at
least three times as much.

30:51.021 --> 30:52.539
Absolutely.

30:52.540 --> 30:53.747
I wonder if that's what
he was talking about?

30:53.748 --> 30:55.129
What who was talking about?

30:56.613 --> 30:58.200
I'm gonna head down to the
bank, see how this happened.

30:58.201 --> 30:59.684
Will you just give it
to me, I'll handle it.

30:59.685 --> 31:01.756
No, you guys keep
working. I got it.

31:20.671 --> 31:22.569
I'm gonna walk around a bit.

31:22.570 --> 31:23.398
Mm-hmm.

31:46.214 --> 31:47.456
Hey Elliot.

31:47.457 --> 31:48.458
Hey Callie.

31:49.804 --> 31:51.494
Nice spot, huh?

31:51.495 --> 31:52.427
Yeah.

31:59.987 --> 32:02.506
So I heard my uncle
talking on the phone.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.163
He said police think your
dad had something to do

32:05.164 --> 32:06.510
with that old man
getting killed?

32:07.856 --> 32:08.788
I guess.

32:10.549 --> 32:12.170
Dad made me leave
when the police came

32:12.171 --> 32:13.828
to search my cousin's house.

32:15.450 --> 32:17.487
I still saw them put
him in a police car.

32:21.732 --> 32:22.630
That's terrible.

32:24.839 --> 32:26.288
Do you think that?

32:26.289 --> 32:28.947
Are you asking me if I think
my dad killed Mr. Potter?

32:46.999 --> 32:47.966
Apparently.

32:47.967 --> 32:49.483
Well, you've got to tell him!

32:51.245 --> 32:52.521
Elliot?

32:52.522 --> 32:53.316
Callie?

32:55.214 --> 32:56.560
Everything okay?

33:16.511 --> 33:17.925
Patrice.

33:17.926 --> 33:19.582
Oh, hi!

33:19.583 --> 33:23.862
Sorry, I'm just, I'm just
packing up Mr. Potter things

33:23.863 --> 33:25.726
to make way for the
new acting president.

33:25.727 --> 33:26.934
I don't mean to interrupt.

33:26.935 --> 33:28.453
I was just wanting
to talk to you

33:28.454 --> 33:31.147
about the appraisal for the
house donated to Sunnyside.

33:32.286 --> 33:34.632
Oh, well, you should
ask Mr. Drummond,

33:34.633 --> 33:36.806
who's also the new
acting president,

33:36.807 --> 33:38.084
at least until the
border appoints him

33:38.085 --> 33:40.293
to the position permanently.

33:40.294 --> 33:42.536
Drummond got Potter's job?

33:42.537 --> 33:43.813
Yes.

33:43.814 --> 33:45.885
He's always wanted to be
president of this bank.

33:47.922 --> 33:49.405
Oh, let me help you with that.

33:49.406 --> 33:50.200
Thank you.

33:55.757 --> 33:56.689
What is it?

33:56.690 --> 33:58.552
It's heavier than I thought.

33:58.553 --> 34:02.522
Maybe we could find a security
guard to help carry it.

34:02.523 --> 34:04.593
Right, I'll ask Brad.

34:18.194 --> 34:19.849
Oh, I didn't see you there.

34:19.850 --> 34:22.128
What, what are you doing here?

34:22.129 --> 34:23.475
You're moving in already?

34:24.614 --> 34:25.786
I suppose it's bad form

34:25.787 --> 34:28.135
to move into Charles's
office so fast.

34:30.447 --> 34:32.139
Maybe I should
wait a week or two.

34:33.312 --> 34:35.555
Yeah, I don't know the
protocol on that one.

34:35.556 --> 34:36.832
I was just wondering

34:36.833 --> 34:38.075
if you might take a
look at this for me.

34:38.076 --> 34:40.836
It's the appraisal
on the Forest House.

34:40.837 --> 34:43.081
Would you tell me if anything
looks strange to you?

34:45.876 --> 34:49.189
The value for the property
doesn't seem too low.

34:49.190 --> 34:50.778
Oh, well that can't be right.

34:52.193 --> 34:53.607
You didn't know?

34:53.608 --> 34:55.506
If the board voted
to donate the house

34:55.507 --> 34:57.094
at that value than it's?

34:57.095 --> 34:59.199
Well, I'm not a voting
member of the board.

34:59.200 --> 35:01.996
So I don't know exactly
what value they approved.

35:03.170 --> 35:05.895
Wouldn't it be in
the meeting minutes?

35:05.896 --> 35:08.829
You're right and I
will try to dig those up.

35:08.830 --> 35:10.624
You know, I'd be happy to
track the appraiser down,

35:10.625 --> 35:12.039
see why the number's so off.

35:12.040 --> 35:13.075
Hold on. That's okay.

35:13.076 --> 35:14.870
You know what? I will do that.

35:14.871 --> 35:16.803
I'd like to get an explanation
for all the paperwork

35:16.804 --> 35:19.495
that I'm gonna have to do
to correct this mistake.

35:19.496 --> 35:21.083
All right, well, when
you get it, let me know,

35:21.084 --> 35:23.637
because I need to
file accurate numbers

35:23.638 --> 35:26.088
to file with the county
for the renovation.

35:26.089 --> 35:27.572
Yeah, I'll do that.

35:27.573 --> 35:28.402
Right.

35:31.508 --> 35:32.681
Yeah.

35:43.693 --> 35:46.626
So, I'm thinking this book
signing will draw a big crowd

35:46.627 --> 35:48.283
and I'm wondering if you
can help me figure out

35:48.284 --> 35:49.630
what to do about parking.

35:52.391 --> 35:53.392
Earth to Tommy.

35:54.669 --> 35:55.601
Sorry, can we talk
about that tomorrow?

35:55.602 --> 35:57.292
I'm kind of busy right now.

35:57.293 --> 35:59.743
I just got back the
autopsy results on Potter.

36:02.608 --> 36:04.471
What's it say?

36:04.472 --> 36:05.921
Well, no big surprises.

36:05.922 --> 36:08.026
So is it true that
you have a suspect?

36:08.027 --> 36:10.478
Uh, Tommy? Do
you have a minute.

36:14.310 --> 36:15.965
Hey, Jen? Can I
call you right back?

36:15.966 --> 36:18.036
I was about to call Tommy.

36:18.037 --> 36:19.521
No, you don't have
to call me back.

36:19.522 --> 36:20.867
I just want you to know
that I went to Sunnyside,

36:20.868 --> 36:22.420
but I wasn't able to
talk to Marie Bishop.

36:22.421 --> 36:25.596
She was in the middle of
some kind of an argument and...

36:25.597 --> 36:27.563
Wait, an argument? With who?

36:27.564 --> 36:29.047
Oh, that vice
president from the bank.

36:29.048 --> 36:31.774
What's his name? Dave Drummond.

36:31.775 --> 36:32.604
Really?

36:37.022 --> 36:39.575
Chief, this is Elliot Hopkins.

36:39.576 --> 36:42.510
Oh son, just tell Chief Jensen
here what you just told me.

36:45.168 --> 36:47.928
Last night, me and my
dad went to the store

36:47.929 --> 36:50.724
and I asked him if we
could stop at our new house

36:50.725 --> 36:52.174
on the way back.

36:52.175 --> 36:53.762
So we did.

36:53.763 --> 36:55.937
And we just kind of
parked there for awhile.

36:56.904 --> 36:59.768
Okay. So for how long?

36:59.769 --> 37:02.115
I don't know, like 20 minutes.

37:02.116 --> 37:04.704
So did either of you get
out of the truck at any time?

37:04.705 --> 37:06.878
Not for any reason at all?

37:06.879 --> 37:07.914
No. No.

37:07.915 --> 37:10.468
We just talked and made plans.

37:10.469 --> 37:12.953
Like I want an Xbox.

37:12.954 --> 37:15.887
So you were with your
father, the entire 20 minutes.

37:15.888 --> 37:17.131
You never left his sight?

37:18.132 --> 37:19.546
No, sir.

37:19.547 --> 37:20.823
And you didn't see anyone coming

37:20.824 --> 37:22.412
or going from the
property, correct?

37:23.931 --> 37:26.933
Sorry, your job
to ask questions.

37:26.934 --> 37:28.521
My dad didn't do anything wrong.

37:28.522 --> 37:30.040
You shouldn't be keeping here.

37:31.904 --> 37:34.458
Well, Elliot, we only
brought your father

37:34.459 --> 37:35.907
in for questioning.

37:35.908 --> 37:37.875
But seeing as nothing
turned up in a search

37:37.876 --> 37:40.603
and now that you have
accounted for his time,

37:42.087 --> 37:44.848
well, I think that we can
let him go home with you.

37:46.540 --> 37:47.781
Thank you, sir.

37:47.782 --> 37:49.266
Okay, but if either,
if you think of anything

37:49.267 --> 37:50.853
you might have seen when
you were in front of the...

37:54.341 --> 37:55.858
Tommy it's Shannon.

37:55.859 --> 37:58.136
There's something down at
the bank I need you to see.

37:58.137 --> 37:59.345
And what about the meeting

37:59.346 --> 38:01.692
with the south branch
manager on Thursday?

38:03.281 --> 38:04.695
Officer Sloane.

38:04.696 --> 38:06.490
You didn't tell us you'd
be coming back today.

38:06.491 --> 38:07.663
Yeah, I just need to look

38:07.664 --> 38:09.148
around Potter's
office one more time.

38:12.048 --> 38:13.428
I had a few questions.

38:13.429 --> 38:15.222
I thought a licensed
contractor might help with.

38:15.223 --> 38:18.536
That's me, I'm very licensed.

38:18.537 --> 38:20.125
Which of course, you know.

38:29.065 --> 38:30.237
It's starting to irritate me

38:30.238 --> 38:31.964
how she keeps popping
up around here.

38:33.828 --> 38:35.553
These marks around the lock.

38:35.554 --> 38:38.901
Someone tried to break into the
drawer with something sharp.

38:38.902 --> 38:41.904
I see it all the time with
old houses that I work on,

38:41.905 --> 38:43.768
people lose keys to the locks

38:43.769 --> 38:46.046
and someone tries
to force them open.

38:46.047 --> 38:48.325
The gouges in the
wood are fresh.

38:48.326 --> 38:49.809
Yeah, I'd say so.

38:49.810 --> 38:52.052
They weren't here earlier
when we searched the office.

38:52.053 --> 38:54.054
Do you know
what's in the drawer?

38:54.055 --> 38:56.850
No, it seems Potter
had the only key,

38:56.851 --> 38:59.163
but it wasn't on
him when he died.

38:59.164 --> 39:00.613
I was planning on
going to his house,

39:00.614 --> 39:02.062
see if his wife could
come up with it.

39:02.063 --> 39:03.581
But if somebody somebody's
already gotten to what's inside.

39:03.582 --> 39:05.997
No, if somebody
forced this lock open,

39:05.998 --> 39:08.137
it would be impossible
to lock it again.

39:08.138 --> 39:09.415
That's true.

39:09.416 --> 39:10.968
I have a tool in my truck.

39:10.969 --> 39:13.211
I could get this drawer
open if you wanted.

39:13.212 --> 39:14.628
We need a warrant for that.

39:16.008 --> 39:17.665
Or permission from
Dave Drummond.

39:18.494 --> 39:19.494
You know what?

39:19.495 --> 39:21.012
The day Potter was killed,

39:21.013 --> 39:22.704
he mentioned to Marie Bishop,

39:22.705 --> 39:25.189
he thought that Drummond
had duped the board

39:25.190 --> 39:27.916
into donating the Forest House.

39:27.917 --> 39:29.780
And you're only
telling me this now?

39:29.781 --> 39:32.817
Well, he also insinuated
that I was taking money

39:32.818 --> 39:34.025
under the table.

39:34.026 --> 39:35.544
So I didn't take
him very seriously.

39:35.545 --> 39:38.340
But I saw the appraisal today.

39:38.341 --> 39:40.100
The numbers are really low.

39:40.101 --> 39:41.412
Drummond says he didn't know,

39:41.413 --> 39:43.035
but I don't see how he couldn't.

39:45.383 --> 39:46.832
I need to talk to Drummond.

39:53.080 --> 39:54.701
Mr. Drummond.

39:54.702 --> 39:56.358
How can I help
you Officer Sloane?

39:56.359 --> 39:57.842
First of all, I need
the bank's permission

39:57.843 --> 40:01.052
to get into a locked drawer
inside Charles Potter's desk.

40:01.053 --> 40:03.123
Yeah, sure. Whatever you need.

40:03.124 --> 40:04.643
All right, I'll
get my toolbox then.

40:06.058 --> 40:07.645
Also I'd like you to find
some time this afternoon

40:07.646 --> 40:10.372
to maybe come down to the
station, answer a few questions.

40:10.373 --> 40:11.580
Hey!

40:11.581 --> 40:12.133
Well, what kind of questions?

40:12.134 --> 40:13.548
Hey.

40:13.549 --> 40:14.756
Just sit tight for a second.

40:14.757 --> 40:15.758
Why? What's wrong?

40:16.931 --> 40:18.761
My missing wrench,
red and black grip.

40:23.179 --> 40:25.802
Mr. Drummond, do I have
permission to open your back door?

40:27.321 --> 40:28.702
Yeah, I guess.

40:30.738 --> 40:32.050
Unlock it for me, please.

40:42.750 --> 40:44.717
Hey, I've never
seen that before.

40:44.718 --> 40:46.236
I don't know how
that got in there.

40:50.068 --> 40:52.138
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask
you to get out of your car.

40:52.139 --> 40:54.278
Somebody else
put that in my car.

40:54.279 --> 40:56.005
Step out of your
car, please, sir.

40:57.972 --> 40:58.801
Hey! Hey!

40:59.871 --> 41:00.699
Stop!

41:11.434 --> 41:12.504
Stop the car!

41:17.716 --> 41:19.511
All right, Drummond,
show me your hands!

41:22.272 --> 41:23.308
Step out of the car.

41:27.726 --> 41:28.624
Step out of the car.

41:28.624 --> 41:29.487
Okay.

41:32.455 --> 41:33.662
And you think
it was Dave Drummond.

41:33.663 --> 41:36.389
His lawyer won't let
him say two words to me.

41:36.390 --> 41:37.666
And he did swear up and down

41:37.667 --> 41:39.599
that the wrench was
planted in his car.

41:39.600 --> 41:42.360
And the lab confirmed
it is the murder weapon.

41:42.361 --> 41:43.603
I'm sorry.

41:43.604 --> 41:45.122
I thought I had an extra
copy of the appraisal.

41:45.123 --> 41:46.710
I can't find it.

41:46.711 --> 41:48.297
All right, I guess
I'll have to figure out

41:48.298 --> 41:50.368
another way of tracking
down this appraiser.

41:50.369 --> 41:51.818
I wish I could
tell you who it was.

41:51.819 --> 41:54.787
I was so focused on the number
I didn't catch the name.

41:54.788 --> 41:56.616
Yeah and the judge
that's in tomorrow

41:56.617 --> 41:58.100
won't be asking me to
sign search warrants

41:58.101 --> 42:00.033
for Drummond's
office and computer.

42:00.034 --> 42:01.760
Should have them in
the next day or two.

42:02.865 --> 42:03.968
Bye.

42:03.969 --> 42:05.729
Oh, hey Tommy, how's it going?

42:05.730 --> 42:07.006
Busy.

42:07.007 --> 42:07.939
Hey, I heard you're
doing a book signing

42:07.940 --> 42:09.905
at my sister's bookstore.

42:09.906 --> 42:11.079
Thanks for doing that.

42:11.080 --> 42:12.599
Yeah well I'm
looking forward to it.

42:15.222 --> 42:16.602
What was he doing here?

42:16.603 --> 42:19.915
Oh, looking for
something I don't have.

42:19.916 --> 42:21.158
What is that?

42:21.159 --> 42:22.884
Uncle Mac won this guy
for me at the arcade.

42:22.885 --> 42:24.679
I'm gonna go post some
pictures of him online.

42:24.680 --> 42:27.889
Wow. It looks
like you guys had fun.

42:27.890 --> 42:29.062
We did. We did.

42:29.063 --> 42:30.788
I haven't been doing
arcade in years.

42:30.789 --> 42:33.135
I mean they had all
sorts of retro games.

42:33.136 --> 42:34.378
It was fun. We should go.

42:34.379 --> 42:36.588
You and me? Do you
mean like a date?

42:38.003 --> 42:39.557
No, no, no.

42:40.696 --> 42:42.317
That is, I mean, I
know you're not ready

42:42.318 --> 42:44.009
for anything like
that yet, right?

42:45.114 --> 42:46.632
Are you?

42:46.633 --> 42:48.703
I mean, I know that
you might have reasons

42:48.704 --> 42:50.429
to not wanna go there.

42:57.954 --> 43:00.681
You guys have no idea
how to communicate, do you?

43:12.659 --> 43:14.176
It's my dad.

43:14.177 --> 43:15.764
Chief Jensen cleared us to go
back into the Forest House.

43:15.765 --> 43:17.077
The project is back on.

43:22.600 --> 43:23.600
Hey guys.

43:23.601 --> 43:25.774
Ah, glad you're here.

43:25.775 --> 43:28.121
Listen, I wanted to thank
you for helping us out

43:28.122 --> 43:29.951
with that police situation.

43:29.952 --> 43:30.780
No problem.

43:32.023 --> 43:34.231
So pretty quiet here today.

43:34.232 --> 43:35.991
Yeah, where all the volunteers?

43:35.992 --> 43:37.821
Well, I guess most of
them haven't realized

43:37.822 --> 43:39.374
we're back in business yet.

43:39.375 --> 43:42.515
Wow. Jennifer told us that
Callie's on pink crew today.

43:42.516 --> 43:43.723
Great.

43:43.724 --> 43:46.312
Oh, well, let me give
you a rundown, Callie.

43:46.313 --> 43:47.694
I can show her what to do.

43:49.143 --> 43:51.629
Good, then Sean could
show me how to hang drywall.

43:53.182 --> 43:55.252
Right this way, Mr. Drywall.

43:59.050 --> 44:02.224
The appraisal. Yes!

44:02.225 --> 44:04.537
Of course. We keep extra
copies of everything.

44:04.538 --> 44:06.125
You know that.

44:06.126 --> 44:08.023
Dad, you are awesome.

44:09.232 --> 44:10.370
Hey, have you seen
Mac yet this morning?

44:10.371 --> 44:11.269
No, I haven't.

44:12.408 --> 44:14.409
Hey guys, it's
already 10 o'clock.

44:14.410 --> 44:16.411
I still had over
half the assignments

44:16.412 --> 44:18.413
and no one to give them to.

44:18.414 --> 44:19.656
I really hoped more volunteers

44:19.657 --> 44:20.933
would be trickling in by now.

44:20.934 --> 44:22.382
I know, I called a few of them

44:22.383 --> 44:23.660
to see why they're
not showing up.

44:23.661 --> 44:26.110
And, I mean, everyone
is saying same thing.

44:26.111 --> 44:27.491
They're upset about the murder.

44:27.492 --> 44:29.631
- You know.
- They don't feel safe.

44:29.632 --> 44:31.495
No, I don't know who
can feel safe in this town

44:31.496 --> 44:32.842
until the killer is caught.

44:35.258 --> 44:38.260
Dad, you have to let me
out of that promise I made.

44:38.261 --> 44:40.850
I want to help figure out
who killed Charles Potter?

44:41.989 --> 44:43.887
The police have Dave
Drummond in custody.

44:43.888 --> 44:44.957
But they haven't charged him.

44:44.958 --> 44:46.993
I don't think they have enough.

44:46.994 --> 44:48.374
So give them time.

44:48.375 --> 44:51.032
They might have
time, but we don't.

44:51.033 --> 44:52.378
If this murder
isn't solved soon,

44:52.379 --> 44:54.276
this project is in real trouble.

44:54.277 --> 44:55.553
I understand that...

44:55.554 --> 44:57.383
No, the house is gonna
revert back to the bank.

44:57.384 --> 44:58.833
Look...

44:58.834 --> 45:00.558
Everybody counting on having
a home here won't have it.

45:05.530 --> 45:07.151
I've been planning
this project for a year

45:07.152 --> 45:10.707
and barely three days in
it's already in jeopardy.

45:10.708 --> 45:12.294
We're going do our best.

45:12.295 --> 45:13.710
And you might pull it off.

45:13.711 --> 45:16.264
But I need to tell our clients

45:16.265 --> 45:18.266
that they might need
to make other plans.

45:18.267 --> 45:19.716
At least wait till
the end of the week.

45:19.717 --> 45:21.648
They might charge Dave Drummond.

45:21.649 --> 45:23.616
I don't believe Dave did it.

45:23.617 --> 45:26.136
Dave has been our
champion this entire time

45:26.137 --> 45:29.104
and he's a good person.

45:29.105 --> 45:31.210
And yet you are arguing with him

45:31.211 --> 45:32.039
outside your office yesterday.

45:32.040 --> 45:33.557
Why was that?

45:33.558 --> 45:34.800
Did it have anything to do

45:34.801 --> 45:37.664
with the appraisal of
this property being off?

45:37.665 --> 45:38.838
I, I...

45:48.884 --> 45:51.195
Mac, are you okay?

45:51.196 --> 45:52.646
I don't know what happened.

45:53.578 --> 45:54.578
I was.

45:54.579 --> 45:55.752
It's okay.

45:55.753 --> 45:58.168
We allow for sheet rock
loss our her budget.

45:58.169 --> 45:59.548
So I did exactly what
Sean told me to do.

45:59.549 --> 46:02.759
I was just replacing a
little damaged section.

46:02.760 --> 46:04.381
I'll take a look at it,

46:04.382 --> 46:06.279
but I need you to
do something for me

46:06.280 --> 46:09.386
that might be a little better
suited to your skillset.

46:09.387 --> 46:11.698
Track down this
appraiser for me.

46:11.699 --> 46:12.769
This guy here.

46:12.770 --> 46:14.667
See why he valued this property

46:14.668 --> 46:16.807
at about a 1/3 of
what it's worth.

46:16.808 --> 46:18.636
I want to know before
I bring this to Tommy.

46:18.637 --> 46:21.433
Okay. It's gotta be
easier than hanging drywall.

46:28.199 --> 46:29.786
What's going on, Chief.

46:29.787 --> 46:31.719
You're not letting
this guy go, are you?

46:32.962 --> 46:33.791
Stay put.

46:39.624 --> 46:42.074
I'm cutting Drummond
loose for the moment.

46:42.075 --> 46:43.420
Okay, I know it's a problem

46:43.421 --> 46:45.008
his prints aren't on the weapon,

46:45.009 --> 46:46.457
but the wrench was
found in his car.

46:46.458 --> 46:47.942
That's solid evidence.

46:47.943 --> 46:51.117
Well, it's not enough to
charge him and the DA agrees.

46:51.118 --> 46:52.016
We can't hold him.

46:54.259 --> 46:54.984
Yes, sir.

46:58.677 --> 47:01.127
Okay, you are free to go,

47:01.128 --> 47:03.716
but don't plan on
making any trips.

47:03.717 --> 47:05.511
I'm not going anywhere.

47:05.512 --> 47:07.582
I didn't do anything wrong.

47:20.216 --> 47:21.838
And what exactly
is it you're doing?

47:21.839 --> 47:24.426
That's strange.
This wood is damp.

47:29.847 --> 47:31.572
You see that?
That's water damage.

47:40.788 --> 47:44.032
I'm getting high
moisture numbers.

47:44.033 --> 47:47.208
You see how the edges of
the tile here buckled.

47:47.209 --> 47:48.037
- Mm-hmm.
- It means the wood

47:48.038 --> 47:49.590
underneath is warped.

47:51.316 --> 47:54.456
I would say that this room was
flooded with water recently.

47:54.457 --> 47:56.770
Maybe it seeped through
a crack in the vanity.

47:58.806 --> 48:00.255
This entire floor has got

48:00.256 --> 48:01.878
to be torn up and replaced.

48:01.879 --> 48:04.846
Who know how far water even
seeped into other rooms.

48:04.847 --> 48:07.400
But isn't that gonna add
more time to the renovation?

48:07.401 --> 48:09.747
Three, maybe four days.

48:09.748 --> 48:12.543
I checked this room
before I took the job.

48:12.544 --> 48:14.339
I would have noticed
a couple tiles.

48:19.344 --> 48:20.758
Look at this.

48:20.759 --> 48:22.484
Someone took a
wrench to this pipe.

48:22.485 --> 48:23.728
These marks are fresh.

48:25.730 --> 48:28.595
I think someone created a leak
under the sink on purpose.

48:31.563 --> 48:34.703
The bottom of Potter's
pants were wet.

48:34.704 --> 48:36.119
Hey, wait a minute,
you think that Potter,

48:36.120 --> 48:38.086
he caught some trying to cause
water damage to the house.

48:38.087 --> 48:41.469
No, I think someone
caught Potter causing damage

48:41.470 --> 48:43.920
to the house and it led
to a terrible fight.

48:43.921 --> 48:46.923
What if Potter was
sabotaging this project?

48:46.924 --> 48:48.476
Trying to make it take so long

48:48.477 --> 48:50.720
that the house would
revert back to the bank.

48:52.136 --> 48:54.552
Jen, I think we just found
a motive for his murder.

49:01.214 --> 49:02.042
Shannon.

49:24.030 --> 49:26.583
Jim. You're still here.

49:26.584 --> 49:29.828
Yeah. I thought I heard
a knock or something.

49:31.140 --> 49:33.210
It's probably the broom.

49:33.211 --> 49:36.041
Shannon, we're gonna
call Tommy now, right?

49:36.042 --> 49:38.044
Yeah, I'm gonna call him.

49:41.323 --> 49:43.117
The paint looks good.

49:43.118 --> 49:43.981
Thanks.

49:55.716 --> 49:56.648
So I have a copy here
of the appraisal done

49:56.649 --> 49:58.339
on the Forest House last March.

49:58.340 --> 49:59.857
That is your signature, right?

49:59.858 --> 50:01.205
Yeah. That's me.

50:02.620 --> 50:04.483
All right, do you
remember doing the appraisal?

50:04.484 --> 50:05.416
I do four

50:05.417 --> 50:06.693
or five appraisals every day.

50:07.625 --> 50:08.935
They all kind of blur together.

50:08.936 --> 50:10.661
This was a really big house

50:10.662 --> 50:11.938
and sort of hard to forget.

50:11.939 --> 50:13.458
Let me see if this
jogs your memory.

50:14.908 --> 50:16.909
Well, like I said, I'm
not gonna remember a house

50:16.910 --> 50:17.738
that I did months ago...

50:17.739 --> 50:19.015
Look at the value.

50:19.016 --> 50:21.362
It's a little low for
a seven-bedroom house.

50:21.363 --> 50:22.191
Wouldn't you say?

50:23.123 --> 50:24.917
What the? That's not.

50:24.918 --> 50:27.644
Not what? You're saying
that number isn't accurate?

50:27.645 --> 50:31.096
No, that's not the
number I came up with.

50:31.097 --> 50:32.201
So you do remember?

50:34.376 --> 50:35.998
And that
appraisal's been altered.

50:38.345 --> 50:39.759
You seem pretty
angry about that.

50:39.760 --> 50:41.244
Oh, you think?

50:41.245 --> 50:42.900
Well, why would you be if
somebody altered your appraisal?

50:42.901 --> 50:44.109
Because then it makes people

50:44.110 --> 50:45.420
like you show up
asking me questions.

50:45.421 --> 50:46.353
Oh, and you don't want
me to ask you questions.

50:46.354 --> 50:47.491
No, that wasn't the...

50:47.492 --> 50:48.459
Wasn't the what?

50:49.425 --> 50:51.082
The deal? The arrangement?

50:52.290 --> 50:53.842
I don't know what
you're talking about.

50:53.843 --> 50:55.189
What sort of deal did
you have with Dave Drummond?

50:55.190 --> 50:56.845
Look, I don't know
any Dave Drummond.

50:56.846 --> 50:57.675
Who ordered this this appraisal?

50:57.676 --> 50:59.158
Was it Charles Potter?

50:59.159 --> 50:59.987
Do you have some sort of
deal with Charles Potter?

50:59.988 --> 51:01.127
Look, back off, man.

51:02.990 --> 51:05.923
Fine, I'll give
this to the police.

51:05.924 --> 51:07.064
Tell them to handle it.

51:08.237 --> 51:10.066
Hey, there's no reason for that.

51:10.067 --> 51:12.068
Well, not if you tell me

51:12.069 --> 51:13.967
what sort of deal
you had with Potter.

51:18.247 --> 51:19.696
So this is the
pipe under the sink

51:19.697 --> 51:22.423
and Shannon thinks that
someone purposely damaged it.

51:22.424 --> 51:25.391
So you can see the work
tiles need to be replaced.

51:25.392 --> 51:26.634
She said to ask if you remember

51:26.635 --> 51:28.705
that the bottom of
Potter's pants were wet.

51:28.706 --> 51:29.947
'Cause she thinks
that it's possible

51:29.948 --> 51:31.501
that Potter was the
one that did this

51:31.502 --> 51:32.917
to sabotage the renovation.

51:34.332 --> 51:35.712
And why are you the one
that's telling us this?

51:35.713 --> 51:37.196
Yeah, and who
took these pictures?

51:37.197 --> 51:38.439
Shannon did, but
she texted them to me

51:38.440 --> 51:40.373
because she got a call
from Mac Sullivan.

51:44.998 --> 51:47.310
I'm here to see Patrice Moore.

51:47.311 --> 51:48.105
Thanks.

51:54.041 --> 51:55.628
I'll ask you one more time.

51:55.629 --> 51:58.907
I don't see why you had to
go behind Mr. Potter's desk.

51:58.908 --> 52:00.358
Oh, hi Shannon.

52:01.773 --> 52:04.327
I was just telling Patrice that
I brought Mrs. Potter a card

52:04.328 --> 52:07.813
to thank her for donating
the books to my shop.

52:07.814 --> 52:09.435
I just thought if I put
it in with this mail,

52:09.436 --> 52:11.265
it would get to her, I'm sorry.

52:11.266 --> 52:14.509
I, if you want to give a
true yourself, that's fine.

52:14.510 --> 52:15.786
I should be back volunteering

52:15.787 --> 52:17.995
at the Forest House by tomorrow.

52:20.378 --> 52:21.862
Patrice, are you okay?

52:23.140 --> 52:24.830
Did Whitney upset you?

52:24.831 --> 52:26.350
What? Her?

52:27.799 --> 52:30.939
No, I just, I heard
that Mr. Drummond was released

52:30.940 --> 52:34.151
and well, I don't know if
he's coming back to work or...

52:36.291 --> 52:38.534
Do you think he could
have killed Mr. Potter?

52:39.535 --> 52:40.777
I don't know.

52:40.778 --> 52:42.366
That's what we're
trying to find out.

52:43.953 --> 52:44.713
We?

52:48.026 --> 52:50.166
Whitney, hi.

52:50.167 --> 52:51.719
Not who I expected to see.

52:51.720 --> 52:54.066
Did you see the ad in the
paper for your book signing?

52:54.067 --> 52:55.481
Already got a lot
of phone calls.

52:55.482 --> 52:57.174
Well, that's great.

52:59.037 --> 53:00.348
Oh good, you're here.

53:00.349 --> 53:01.454
Yeah.

53:04.388 --> 53:07.287
About that movie,
how about this weekend?

53:08.978 --> 53:11.464
Um, sure, I'd love that.

53:12.637 --> 53:14.673
If you don't bury me in
paint supplies first.

53:16.676 --> 53:19.403
Hey guys, you want to come
give Jennifer a hand here?

53:23.648 --> 53:25.201
I wonder what
that was all about?

53:25.202 --> 53:26.443
I don't know.

53:26.444 --> 53:27.755
I think they're planning
a mutiny or something.

53:31.000 --> 53:34.521
Okay, what have we got here?

53:35.626 --> 53:36.729
You lied to the police.

53:36.730 --> 53:38.317
I had to.

53:38.318 --> 53:39.836
So the night Mr.
Potter was killed,

53:39.837 --> 53:42.219
you weren't actually with
your dad the whole time?

53:43.461 --> 53:45.290
No, we parked out front.

53:45.291 --> 53:48.120
He said he had to go
check on something

53:48.121 --> 53:49.467
and he got out of the truck.

53:50.848 --> 53:52.505
Then he disappeared
into the dark.

53:53.816 --> 53:55.438
It was only like five minutes.

53:55.439 --> 53:57.130
It doesn't mean
he killed anyone.

54:00.167 --> 54:02.446
Please, please don't tell them.

54:06.277 --> 54:07.829
So this appraiser
says the Potter paid him

54:07.830 --> 54:10.418
to come in low on certain
houses owned by the bank.

54:10.419 --> 54:13.663
But not too low, 40,000, 50,000.

54:13.664 --> 54:15.492
We're thinking so
he could sell low

54:15.493 --> 54:18.115
to the same developer
or house flipper.

54:18.116 --> 54:20.291
We think that Potter
was taking kickbacks.

54:21.844 --> 54:24.156
This isn't news to you.

54:24.157 --> 54:27.298
I overheard Mr. Drummond
accused Mr. Potter of that.

54:28.679 --> 54:31.301
They were arguing
over the Forest House.

54:31.302 --> 54:33.614
Mr. Potter already
had a buyer lined up.

54:33.615 --> 54:35.271
But Drummond got the board

54:35.272 --> 54:39.171
to approve the donation
to Sunnyside instead.

54:39.172 --> 54:41.380
But I don't see why altering
the appraisal would help.

54:41.381 --> 54:44.383
Well, a donation
under a million dollars

54:44.384 --> 54:46.523
doesn't need approval
by the bank president.

54:46.524 --> 54:48.663
That's how Drummond
got around him.

54:48.664 --> 54:51.183
I think Potter was
trying to outsmart Drummond

54:51.184 --> 54:54.082
by sabotaging the project,
making it take so long

54:54.083 --> 54:55.291
we'd miss our deadline

54:55.292 --> 54:57.914
and the house would
revert back to the bank.

54:57.915 --> 54:59.502
Do you think he would
do something like that?

54:59.503 --> 55:01.952
I hope not. That would,
that would be terrible.

55:01.953 --> 55:03.195
We're hoping you
could help us prove

55:03.196 --> 55:05.093
that Potter was
taking kickbacks.

55:05.094 --> 55:07.026
If you had a list of house sales

55:07.027 --> 55:09.546
that Potter was
directly involved with,

55:09.547 --> 55:11.824
maybe to the same buyer

55:11.825 --> 55:12.757
I couldn't do that.

55:12.758 --> 55:14.689
I could get in a lot of trouble.

55:14.690 --> 55:15.932
I don't know.

55:15.933 --> 55:17.347
I mean, home sales
are public record.

55:17.348 --> 55:19.280
We could just look
them up ourselves.

55:19.281 --> 55:22.007
But if you told us what
houses we were looking for,

55:22.008 --> 55:24.389
it would save us a lot of time.

55:24.390 --> 55:27.184
Look, it's not that
I don't want to help,

55:27.185 --> 55:29.601
but those records are
password protected.

55:29.602 --> 55:30.878
How about hard copies?

55:30.879 --> 55:32.156
We could take photos.

55:33.468 --> 55:38.473
Well, I, I
suppose I could lead you

55:39.405 --> 55:41.199
to the file room
in the basement.

55:42.373 --> 55:44.064
Tell you which
drawer to look in.

55:45.652 --> 55:46.481
Thank you.

55:53.695 --> 55:55.489
Those file cabinets there.

55:55.490 --> 55:58.423
Look for sales to
Mulford industries.

55:58.424 --> 55:59.665
Thank you, Patrice.

55:59.666 --> 56:01.218
Oh, and, and leave
the door propped open.

56:01.219 --> 56:04.360
It locks automatically and I
don't dare give you my keys.

56:04.361 --> 56:06.639
No, no, we don't want
you to get in trouble.

56:08.813 --> 56:10.401
And please hurry.

56:11.540 --> 56:12.369
Okay.

56:14.578 --> 56:16.233
She said Mulford?

56:16.234 --> 56:17.476
Yeah, think so.

56:17.477 --> 56:19.168
McCarthy, Mulford.

56:27.280 --> 56:32.112
Wait, this appraisal lists
previous owner is James Hopkins.

56:33.251 --> 56:35.322
This bank foreclosed
on Jim's house.

56:42.744 --> 56:43.572
Hey!

56:45.988 --> 56:48.611
No cell signal, however,

56:48.612 --> 56:50.716
someone's bound to
come down eventually.

56:50.717 --> 56:52.304
Right?

56:52.305 --> 56:53.754
No. It's the computer age.

56:53.755 --> 56:55.446
I think filing is
an afterthought

56:56.585 --> 56:57.999
But I think I could
get us out of here

56:58.000 --> 57:00.726
if I found the right tools.

57:00.727 --> 57:01.969
Such as?

57:01.970 --> 57:05.422
Something long and
thin like a nail.

57:12.256 --> 57:13.188
Or a pin.

57:13.189 --> 57:14.257
Okay, now I just need something

57:14.258 --> 57:16.052
to drive it with like a hammer.

57:16.053 --> 57:17.054
All right.

57:25.096 --> 57:27.443
So Callie tells me
how much she misses you

57:27.444 --> 57:28.858
since you've moved away.

57:28.859 --> 57:30.618
Yeah, I miss her like crazy.

57:30.619 --> 57:31.689
How about a stapler?

57:33.208 --> 57:36.453
She also sort of told
me why he moved away.

57:38.938 --> 57:40.766
Should have seen that coming.

57:40.767 --> 57:42.597
You never told me
you were engaged.

57:44.081 --> 57:46.289
Never told you that I left
my bride to be at the alter

57:46.290 --> 57:48.913
and gained the reputation
as the world's biggest cad?

57:50.259 --> 57:51.191
You're not a cad.

57:52.434 --> 57:54.091
There must be more to the story.

57:56.058 --> 57:58.715
Well, that makes you
one of the few people

57:58.716 --> 58:01.131
who gives me the
benefit of the doubt.

58:01.132 --> 58:03.065
I'd love to know what happened.

58:04.066 --> 58:05.895
No.

58:05.896 --> 58:07.691
It's okay, I understand.

58:14.699 --> 58:17.942
My fiance had truth issues,

58:19.047 --> 58:22.049
which I learned about
when she told me

58:22.050 --> 58:25.466
that technically I was not
gonna be her first husband,

58:25.467 --> 58:28.055
because technically
she never got around

58:28.056 --> 58:29.436
to filing for divorce.

58:31.024 --> 58:33.267
But instead of telling everybody

58:33.268 --> 58:35.649
why you didn't go
through with the wedding,

58:35.650 --> 58:37.927
you let them think
you were the bad guy.

58:41.172 --> 58:42.691
That must've been very painful.

58:46.005 --> 58:50.664
That's one word for it.

58:50.665 --> 58:52.251
And that's why you told me

58:52.252 --> 58:53.840
you weren't ready to date again.

58:56.325 --> 58:57.154
Yeah.

59:02.055 --> 59:02.884
So.

59:05.852 --> 59:07.785
Now you know my reason.

59:09.546 --> 59:11.858
Why don't you tell me yours?

59:15.310 --> 59:17.657
Got the pins out
and we are free.

59:27.184 --> 59:29.530
Oh, Shannon. Hello.

59:29.531 --> 59:31.532
Marie, are you okay?

59:31.533 --> 59:34.052
Yes. I, I am looking for Dave.

59:34.053 --> 59:36.606
I heard the police let him
go and I need to talk to him.

59:36.607 --> 59:37.814
He's not here.

59:37.815 --> 59:39.645
At least he wasn't
in his office.

59:40.784 --> 59:44.027
Oh, well I'm sure
he'll call me back soon.

59:44.028 --> 59:44.960
Thanks.

59:44.961 --> 59:46.236
Were you here to talk to him

59:46.237 --> 59:48.307
about the appraisal
on the Forest House?

59:48.308 --> 59:49.758
We know that he altered it.

59:50.897 --> 59:52.519
You knew, didn't you?

59:53.797 --> 59:55.314
That's why you were
arguing with him

59:55.315 --> 59:56.972
that day after
Potter was killed.

59:58.733 --> 1:00:02.149
Okay, yes, but I
swear, I didn't know,

1:00:02.150 --> 1:00:03.288
before Potter was killed.

1:00:03.289 --> 1:00:04.531
And if I had known...

1:00:08.743 --> 1:00:11.192
You don't know how
difficult it was

1:00:11.193 --> 1:00:13.470
to deal with someone
like Charles Potter.

1:00:13.471 --> 1:00:15.956
He had a way of making
good people do things

1:00:15.957 --> 1:00:18.130
that they would
otherwise never do.

1:00:18.131 --> 1:00:20.305
Making them feel that
it's perfectly reasonable

1:00:20.306 --> 1:00:22.653
to do the wrong thing,
to get the right result.

1:00:25.207 --> 1:00:26.587
Sorry.

1:00:26.588 --> 1:00:28.831
I'm just, uh, ignore me.

1:00:28.832 --> 1:00:30.211
I'm just upset.

1:00:30.212 --> 1:00:31.041
But I have to go.

1:00:33.630 --> 1:00:35.078
Did it sound like
she was just about

1:00:35.079 --> 1:00:36.493
to confess to the murder.

1:00:36.494 --> 1:00:37.461
Well, or she's figured out

1:00:37.462 --> 1:00:39.152
that it was Drummond who did it.

1:00:44.088 --> 1:00:46.642
We should go let Tommy know
everything we found out today.

1:00:46.643 --> 1:00:47.850
All right, I gotta
pick up Callie.

1:00:47.851 --> 1:00:48.645
I'll meet you back
at your place.

1:00:48.645 --> 1:00:49.438
Okay.

1:01:13.014 --> 1:01:15.325
What are you doing here?

1:01:15.326 --> 1:01:16.568
Waiting for you.

1:01:16.569 --> 1:01:17.397
- Please, please.
- No, please don't.

1:01:17.398 --> 1:01:18.674
Step back.

1:01:18.675 --> 1:01:20.054
Not until you hear
what I have to say.

1:01:20.055 --> 1:01:21.677
I'm sorry if I scared you,

1:01:21.678 --> 1:01:23.264
I just, I don't know
where else to turn it.

1:01:23.265 --> 1:01:24.645
And you seem to
be the one person

1:01:24.646 --> 1:01:26.959
who actually cares about
finding out the truth.

1:01:29.893 --> 1:01:30.721
I'm listening.

1:01:31.998 --> 1:01:34.448
You have no idea what
it's like being framed

1:01:34.449 --> 1:01:35.863
for something that
you didn't do.

1:01:35.864 --> 1:01:37.314
You altered the appraisal.

1:01:38.487 --> 1:01:39.625
I did, I did.

1:01:39.626 --> 1:01:41.110
But it was for a good cause.

1:01:41.111 --> 1:01:43.906
And just once I wanted to
beat Charles at his own game,

1:01:43.907 --> 1:01:45.114
but I'm not good at it.

1:01:45.115 --> 1:01:47.185
I don't have his
talent for corruption.

1:01:47.186 --> 1:01:49.671
You mean the kickbacks
that he's been pocketing?

1:01:50.983 --> 1:01:52.121
Yeah.

1:01:52.122 --> 1:01:54.157
I knew something was wrong.

1:01:54.158 --> 1:01:55.400
A friend of mine who works

1:01:55.401 --> 1:01:56.608
at the Green Meadows
Credit Union said

1:01:56.609 --> 1:01:58.748
that Charles had opened
a safe deposit box

1:01:58.749 --> 1:01:59.991
under an assumed name.

1:01:59.992 --> 1:02:01.475
Did you tell this to the police?

1:02:01.476 --> 1:02:02.959
No! My lawyer won't let
me tell them anything.

1:02:02.960 --> 1:02:05.030
He says, all they care
about is proving me guilty,

1:02:05.031 --> 1:02:06.307
which is why I'm here

1:02:06.308 --> 1:02:09.034
because I need someone
to prove me innocent.

1:02:09.035 --> 1:02:11.209
Please, I have a
wife, I have kids

1:02:11.210 --> 1:02:12.589
and I cannot end up in prison

1:02:12.590 --> 1:02:14.075
for a murder I didn't commit.

1:02:16.284 --> 1:02:17.525
Please.

1:02:23.843 --> 1:02:25.119
Drummond was waiting for you

1:02:25.120 --> 1:02:27.018
and you didn't call the police.

1:02:27.019 --> 1:02:29.262
Sh, you're gonna wake Callie.

1:02:30.332 --> 1:02:31.747
You should have called Tommy.

1:02:31.748 --> 1:02:33.059
You should have called me.

1:02:35.959 --> 1:02:36.993
I did call Tommy.

1:02:36.994 --> 1:02:38.270
He's out on a lead.

1:02:38.271 --> 1:02:39.547
He said he would be
here in the morning.

1:02:39.548 --> 1:02:43.414
But the thing is, is
I believe Drummond.

1:02:44.899 --> 1:02:47.935
Shannon, he lied to your
face about the appraisal.

1:02:47.936 --> 1:02:49.799
If he's being framed for murder,

1:02:49.800 --> 1:02:51.421
can you blame him
for being desperate?

1:02:51.422 --> 1:02:53.285
He lied to you before
he was a murder suspect,

1:02:53.286 --> 1:02:55.599
before you found the
murder weapon in his car.

1:02:57.912 --> 1:03:00.741
That's true.

1:03:00.742 --> 1:03:02.191
But if he's guilty,

1:03:02.192 --> 1:03:04.194
why would he want me to
prove that he's innocent?

1:03:05.643 --> 1:03:07.645
Why would a murderer want
you want you on his side?

1:03:10.338 --> 1:03:12.270
Look, I don't want you and
Callie alone in this house

1:03:12.271 --> 1:03:14.168
with that guy running around.

1:03:14.169 --> 1:03:16.793
I'd feel better if I
could sleep on the couch.

1:03:21.832 --> 1:03:22.695
'Kay.

1:03:35.087 --> 1:03:36.259
Does was my heart good

1:03:36.260 --> 1:03:38.054
to see fresh flowers
on your mother's grave.

1:03:38.055 --> 1:03:39.504
Yeah.

1:03:39.505 --> 1:03:40.989
Didn't expect to see you here.

1:03:43.164 --> 1:03:44.716
I come here
once or twice a week,

1:03:44.717 --> 1:03:47.270
to say hello to the
love of my life.

1:03:47.271 --> 1:03:48.824
So do I.

1:03:48.825 --> 1:03:50.826
Sometimes I feel like I can
hear her saying hello back.

1:03:50.827 --> 1:03:54.761
Mm, you know what she'd
be seeing right now?

1:03:56.177 --> 1:03:58.523
Dad, if you're gonna tell
me that I shouldn't be butting

1:03:58.524 --> 1:04:00.490
into the murder
investigation again...

1:04:00.491 --> 1:04:02.216
Not what I was gonna say.

1:04:02.217 --> 1:04:03.839
Oh.

1:04:03.840 --> 1:04:05.047
So I'm not a mind reader.

1:04:05.048 --> 1:04:06.772
Hm.

1:04:06.773 --> 1:04:09.879
I was gonna say,
she'd be wondering

1:04:09.880 --> 1:04:11.191
when you gonna
turn your attention

1:04:11.192 --> 1:04:12.849
to finding the
love of your life.

1:04:16.749 --> 1:04:19.579
We can't all be as
lucky as you and mom were.

1:04:20.960 --> 1:04:21.823
Darlin',

1:04:23.860 --> 1:04:26.517
love is less about luck

1:04:28.002 --> 1:04:31.177
and more about the willingness
to open your heart.

1:04:34.974 --> 1:04:35.837
Hm.

1:04:38.840 --> 1:04:40.254
It's ringing a bell.

1:04:40.255 --> 1:04:42.395
I think I heard
it in a song once.

1:04:45.674 --> 1:04:47.537
You always make a joke
every time someone brings up

1:04:47.538 --> 1:04:48.711
your love life, huh.

1:04:48.712 --> 1:04:49.885
Or lack thereof.

1:04:49.886 --> 1:04:51.472
See what I mean?

1:04:51.473 --> 1:04:53.303
I've watched you
since you were born.

1:04:54.787 --> 1:04:57.616
I watched how you once open
your heart to the world.

1:04:57.617 --> 1:05:01.000
And when your mother died,
I watched how you withdrew.

1:05:04.624 --> 1:05:07.731
Yes, well, we all did.

1:05:09.181 --> 1:05:12.079
True, but you were so young
and your heart was so broken,

1:05:12.080 --> 1:05:15.980
you developed this
habit of being cautious

1:05:15.981 --> 1:05:17.636
before you had the
time to understand

1:05:17.637 --> 1:05:19.191
how resilient the heart can be.

1:05:22.401 --> 1:05:24.920
If you thought this
about me, why didn't you?

1:05:24.921 --> 1:05:27.233
I know. Why didn't
I tell you before?

1:05:28.648 --> 1:05:30.511
'Cause I hadn't seen you
with anyone where I thought

1:05:30.512 --> 1:05:32.998
maybe it's worth it,
throwing caution at the wind.

1:05:35.932 --> 1:05:37.312
You think Mac is worth it.

1:05:39.211 --> 1:05:42.041
Question is, do you think he is?

1:05:45.424 --> 1:05:47.012
Talk to your mother about it.

1:05:48.703 --> 1:05:49.875
Love you.

1:06:06.652 --> 1:06:07.963
Jennifer called.

1:06:07.964 --> 1:06:09.930
Asked if she could
take you downtown,

1:06:09.931 --> 1:06:12.209
recruit more volunteers
for the renovation.

1:06:13.590 --> 1:06:15.074
Is that something
you want to do?

1:06:17.111 --> 1:06:17.974
Callie?

1:06:19.113 --> 1:06:19.976
You okay?

1:06:22.495 --> 1:06:25.429
What if you know something,
but you promised not to tell?

1:06:26.396 --> 1:06:27.845
What's the right thing to do?

1:06:31.366 --> 1:06:33.091
Hey Tommy, what's up?

1:06:33.092 --> 1:06:34.817
Well, I've been going through
these pictures you sent me,

1:06:34.818 --> 1:06:37.647
trying to figure out
Potter's kickback scheme.

1:06:37.648 --> 1:06:40.685
There's some acronyms in these
files I don't understand.

1:06:40.686 --> 1:06:43.688
Try calling Patrice, I bet
she could help with that.

1:06:43.689 --> 1:06:44.517
Well, that's the thing.

1:06:44.518 --> 1:06:45.724
I called the bank.

1:06:45.725 --> 1:06:46.657
They said she didn't
show up for work today.

1:06:46.657 --> 1:06:47.589
She didn't call either.

1:06:47.590 --> 1:06:49.866
Hm, that's strange.

1:06:49.867 --> 1:06:51.351
Yeah, it's bothering me.

1:06:51.352 --> 1:06:52.628
You said she was worried

1:06:52.629 --> 1:06:55.458
about repercussions for
showing you this stuff.

1:06:55.459 --> 1:06:56.391
You know what?

1:06:56.392 --> 1:06:57.633
She lives in my neighborhood.

1:06:57.634 --> 1:06:59.497
Why don't I stop by and
make sure she's okay.

1:06:59.498 --> 1:07:01.086
All right, thanks, Shannon.

1:07:05.918 --> 1:07:08.368
So, Elliot, really think
you're ready for power tools?

1:07:08.369 --> 1:07:09.266
Oh, he's ready.

1:07:16.963 --> 1:07:17.826
Sorry, Elliot.

1:07:19.104 --> 1:07:20.036
But I had to tell.

1:07:21.934 --> 1:07:25.212
Jim, you want to come with
me to talk to the police

1:07:25.213 --> 1:07:26.835
or should I have them come here?

1:07:44.715 --> 1:07:47.096
So you're telling me, the
night of Potter's murder

1:07:47.097 --> 1:07:49.305
you did get out of your truck?

1:07:49.306 --> 1:07:50.307
Yes, that's right.

1:07:52.447 --> 1:07:54.034
The front door was open.

1:07:54.035 --> 1:07:57.382
I saw a shadow and then
someone leaving the house.

1:07:57.383 --> 1:07:59.212
So I got out of my
truck to check it out.

1:07:59.213 --> 1:08:00.628
And he saw who it was.

1:08:04.149 --> 1:08:05.804
I didn't say
anything up until now,

1:08:05.805 --> 1:08:10.155
because, well, you already
hauled me in once and so

1:08:11.328 --> 1:08:14.227
I didn't want to make
things worse for myself.

1:08:14.228 --> 1:08:16.401
That doesn't even
make any sense.

1:08:16.402 --> 1:08:18.852
I asked you 10 times
if you saw anyone.

1:08:18.853 --> 1:08:20.509
I'm an ex con.

1:08:20.510 --> 1:08:22.511
I know it doesn't
pay to point a finger

1:08:22.512 --> 1:08:25.341
at someone who's
related to a cop.

1:08:25.342 --> 1:08:27.586
He saw your sister, Tommy.

1:08:29.381 --> 1:08:30.622
That's right.

1:08:30.623 --> 1:08:31.934
The woman I saw
leaving the house

1:08:31.935 --> 1:08:35.420
that night was Whitney Sloane.

1:08:48.607 --> 1:08:49.435
Patrice?

1:09:13.494 --> 1:09:15.219
No, she's breathing okay.

1:09:15.220 --> 1:09:16.738
Her eyes haven't opened yet.

1:09:18.050 --> 1:09:19.741
Okay, I'll wait
till you get here.

1:09:23.055 --> 1:09:24.538
Whitney, what happened here?

1:09:24.539 --> 1:09:26.022
I got here right before you did.

1:09:26.023 --> 1:09:28.060
She was already
lying here like that.

1:09:29.095 --> 1:09:31.131
But what are you doing here?

1:09:31.132 --> 1:09:33.307
I don't know what
you mean. I should go.

1:09:37.414 --> 1:09:39.347
Whitney, where are you going?

1:09:53.361 --> 1:09:56.812
It says here exactly
what you told me.

1:09:56.813 --> 1:09:59.159
At approximately 7:40 p.m.
outside the Forest House,

1:09:59.160 --> 1:10:01.851
you witnessed Whitney Sloane
exit through the front door.

1:10:01.852 --> 1:10:03.128
If that's correct

1:10:03.129 --> 1:10:04.717
then please sign your
statement right here.

1:10:08.859 --> 1:10:10.240
I'm sorry it came to this.

1:10:11.414 --> 1:10:14.555
Yeah, well, we prefer
to deal in facts here.

1:10:15.832 --> 1:10:17.178
So if those are the facts.

1:10:21.389 --> 1:10:23.425
I'm gonna go check on the kids.

1:10:23.426 --> 1:10:24.254
Yeah, thanks.

1:10:29.708 --> 1:10:31.018
You know, even if
Whitney was there,

1:10:31.019 --> 1:10:33.435
she had nothing to do
with Potter's murder.

1:10:33.436 --> 1:10:35.231
That girl, she cries
over dead bugs.

1:10:41.892 --> 1:10:43.134
Officer Sloane.

1:10:43.135 --> 1:10:44.239
It's Shannon.

1:10:44.240 --> 1:10:46.241
Patrice was injured.

1:10:46.242 --> 1:10:49.485
There's something I have
to tell you about Whitney.

1:10:53.249 --> 1:10:54.077
Yes, sir.

1:11:01.049 --> 1:11:03.844
The chief says Whitney's not
at home or at the bookstore.

1:11:03.845 --> 1:11:06.330
He just issued an APB on her.

1:11:06.331 --> 1:11:08.470
Whitney said she do it, right?

1:11:08.471 --> 1:11:09.988
It could have been Drummond.

1:11:09.989 --> 1:11:11.025
It could have been.

1:11:12.095 --> 1:11:13.164
She's conscious now.

1:11:13.165 --> 1:11:14.372
Pupils responsive.

1:11:14.373 --> 1:11:16.719
No signs of contusions
just a cut on her head.

1:11:16.720 --> 1:11:18.549
Luckily whoever hit her,
didn't hit too hard,

1:11:18.550 --> 1:11:20.758
but we'll take her for a
CT scan just to be sure.

1:11:20.759 --> 1:11:22.278
You can talk to
her before we go.

1:11:23.589 --> 1:11:24.796
I don't know if I should.

1:11:24.797 --> 1:11:26.420
I mean, not if she's
gonna accuse my sister.

1:11:27.317 --> 1:11:28.524
I'll call the chief.

1:11:28.525 --> 1:11:30.493
See if he thinks I
should recuse myself.

1:11:31.942 --> 1:11:34.599
Officer Sloane, I know
why your sister was here.

1:11:34.600 --> 1:11:37.119
She, she, she was
looking for the letter.

1:11:37.120 --> 1:11:38.431
Ma'am, you should probably wait

1:11:38.432 --> 1:11:39.846
- to tell this letter to your...
- What letter?

1:11:39.847 --> 1:11:41.848
You remember when
she came by the bank

1:11:41.849 --> 1:11:43.884
to drop off a card
for Mrs. Potter.

1:11:43.885 --> 1:11:47.129
I caught her looking through
Mr. Potter's mail basket.

1:11:47.130 --> 1:11:48.752
I found what she
was looking for.

1:11:49.650 --> 1:11:51.547
It's right there on the counter.

1:11:51.548 --> 1:11:52.859
Read it, please.

1:11:52.860 --> 1:11:55.551
You need to know,
everyone needs to know.

1:12:03.974 --> 1:12:06.010
It's Whitney's
handwriting, all right.

1:12:06.011 --> 1:12:07.736
It's a letter to Potter.

1:12:17.229 --> 1:12:18.748
Whitney threatened to kill him.

1:12:23.339 --> 1:12:25.478
Hey, she isn't here.

1:12:25.479 --> 1:12:26.720
What do you mean?

1:12:26.721 --> 1:12:27.515
The ambulance was only
10 minutes ahead of us,

1:12:27.516 --> 1:12:28.722
she's gotta be here.

1:12:28.723 --> 1:12:30.311
I made them check three times.

1:12:32.140 --> 1:12:34.314
Hey, excuse me, miss.

1:12:34.315 --> 1:12:36.247
You brought our friend Patrice.

1:12:36.248 --> 1:12:38.353
We brought her here, but
she refused to come in,

1:12:38.354 --> 1:12:40.078
said she had to get to work.

1:12:40.079 --> 1:12:42.495
Concussions can do that and
make a person disoriented.

1:12:42.496 --> 1:12:44.704
So you let her just walk away?

1:12:44.705 --> 1:12:46.982
People walk away against
medical advice all the time.

1:12:46.983 --> 1:12:48.708
Well, you picked
her up from her house.

1:12:48.709 --> 1:12:49.985
Isn't there a responsibility to...

1:12:49.986 --> 1:12:51.227
It's okay, we'll track her down.

1:12:51.228 --> 1:12:52.022
Thank you.

1:12:53.230 --> 1:12:55.060
Maybe we can find
her at the bank.

1:12:56.475 --> 1:12:57.510
You know what?

1:12:57.511 --> 1:12:58.752
You go look for Patrice.

1:12:58.753 --> 1:13:00.340
I think I know where
Whitney might be.

1:13:00.341 --> 1:13:01.307
Okay.

1:13:21.673 --> 1:13:26.022
Well, if someone had to
find me at least it's you.

1:13:28.334 --> 1:13:29.819
You didn't want to be found.

1:13:34.582 --> 1:13:38.414
What I want is to not
be so afraid anymore.

1:13:39.829 --> 1:13:42.417
I've been so terrified ever
since I sent that letter.

1:13:42.418 --> 1:13:44.902
You threatened to
kill Charles Potter.

1:13:44.903 --> 1:13:47.352
I was so desperate
when I wrote that letter.

1:13:47.353 --> 1:13:48.802
I got a notice from
the bank saying

1:13:48.803 --> 1:13:50.425
they were gonna
foreclose on my shop.

1:13:50.426 --> 1:13:54.014
And so I called and I begged
him to give me more time.

1:13:54.015 --> 1:13:56.845
He basically told me
that it was all my fault.

1:13:56.846 --> 1:13:59.226
And then he hung up on me.

1:13:59.227 --> 1:14:02.367
He upset me so much, I just
wanted to upset him too.

1:14:02.368 --> 1:14:05.025
I didn't really
want to kill him.

1:14:05.026 --> 1:14:06.820
But when he ended up murdered,

1:14:06.821 --> 1:14:09.686
I knew that that letter
would make me look so guilty.

1:14:10.722 --> 1:14:11.929
A witness saw you

1:14:11.930 --> 1:14:14.001
at the Forest House the
night he was killed.

1:14:18.419 --> 1:14:19.902
I lost my phone that morning

1:14:19.903 --> 1:14:21.421
and I thought that I
left it at the house.

1:14:21.422 --> 1:14:23.010
So I went there to look for it.

1:14:23.907 --> 1:14:25.183
The last thing in the world

1:14:25.184 --> 1:14:27.738
I expected to see was
Potter with a wrench.

1:14:27.739 --> 1:14:29.809
Well, why did you
report him that night?

1:14:29.810 --> 1:14:31.293
Tell your brother, someone.

1:14:31.294 --> 1:14:32.122
I don't know.

1:14:32.123 --> 1:14:33.502
Okay, I don't know.

1:14:33.503 --> 1:14:34.745
I don't know.

1:14:34.746 --> 1:14:36.332
I thought maybe he had
a reason for being there

1:14:36.333 --> 1:14:39.163
and then I lost my temper

1:14:39.164 --> 1:14:41.165
and I said some things I
probably shouldn't have said,

1:14:41.166 --> 1:14:43.236
but that's all, I swear.

1:14:43.237 --> 1:14:44.825
I did not kill him.

1:14:46.102 --> 1:14:47.379
Then who did?

1:14:55.007 --> 1:14:56.283
Patrice?

1:15:07.917 --> 1:15:10.953
What are you doing here?

1:15:10.954 --> 1:15:12.299
I'm gonna ask you again.
What are you doing here?

1:15:12.300 --> 1:15:13.508
I'm looking for Patrice.

1:15:13.509 --> 1:15:14.681
When I asked you
to keep digging,

1:15:14.682 --> 1:15:16.165
I didn't mean digging here.

1:15:16.166 --> 1:15:18.064
I was an idiot for thinking
that you believe me, wasn't I?

1:15:18.065 --> 1:15:20.343
You just want to
prove me guilty too.

1:15:21.862 --> 1:15:23.346
You need to back up.

1:15:24.934 --> 1:15:29.939
You think I'm gonna hurt you?

1:15:32.735 --> 1:15:33.736
No. God, no.

1:15:50.891 --> 1:15:51.788
What is it?

1:15:52.996 --> 1:15:55.067
You really didn't
kill Charles Potter.

1:15:59.485 --> 1:16:01.659
I don't know who hurt Patrice,

1:16:01.660 --> 1:16:04.489
but she told me that she thinks
she knows who killed Potter

1:16:04.490 --> 1:16:06.561
and she thought
she could prove it.

1:16:06.562 --> 1:16:08.010
When did she tell you that?

1:16:08.011 --> 1:16:10.219
When she called to say
that she'd give me the letter

1:16:10.220 --> 1:16:11.462
if I brought her the books.

1:16:11.463 --> 1:16:12.636
But I already put the
books on the shelf.

1:16:12.637 --> 1:16:14.293
Books, what books?

1:16:16.226 --> 1:16:20.333
Miss Sloane, I'm gonna
need you to come with me.

1:16:39.318 --> 1:16:42.045
Patrice was working hard
to get in this drawer.

1:16:45.704 --> 1:16:47.429
It was Patrice
who tried to break

1:16:47.430 --> 1:16:49.845
into Potter's desk the
morning after he was killed.

1:16:49.846 --> 1:16:52.366
Although, I have no idea
what she was looking for.

1:16:53.747 --> 1:16:55.368
Do you think it could
have been some kind of book

1:16:55.369 --> 1:16:56.956
because Whitney says
that Patrice called her

1:16:56.957 --> 1:16:59.061
to trade her threatening
letter for some books.

1:16:59.062 --> 1:17:00.615
Why would she?

1:17:00.616 --> 1:17:02.617
Wait, Mrs. Potter donated

1:17:02.618 --> 1:17:05.550
all her husband's books
to Whitney's shop.

1:17:05.551 --> 1:17:06.897
Yeah, Whitney says
that she put them

1:17:06.898 --> 1:17:08.381
on her shelves for sale.

1:17:08.382 --> 1:17:09.038
You think one of the books
could have been worth

1:17:09.039 --> 1:17:10.452
a lot of money.

1:17:10.453 --> 1:17:12.040
I did see her flipping
through them as she was packing.

1:17:12.041 --> 1:17:14.801
Maybe something was
hidden inside one of them.

1:17:14.802 --> 1:17:16.251
Maybe.

1:17:16.252 --> 1:17:17.908
Is it possible that
Patrice gave herself the cut

1:17:17.909 --> 1:17:20.600
on her forehead and
faked being unconscious

1:17:20.601 --> 1:17:23.534
to get rid of Whitney
just to find the books?

1:17:23.535 --> 1:17:26.710
No idea. I'll call Tommy,
tell him your theory.

1:17:26.711 --> 1:17:28.159
But...
Yes.

1:17:28.160 --> 1:17:30.299
Tell him I'm headed to Whitney's
shop to find those books.

1:17:32.648 --> 1:17:33.510
Wait, Shannon!

1:18:01.677 --> 1:18:04.575
I see you found the book
you've been looking for.

1:18:04.576 --> 1:18:07.337
That must be the key to
Potter's safe deposit box.

1:18:11.203 --> 1:18:13.136
You don't know what
you're talking about.

1:18:14.034 --> 1:18:15.620
You're his assistant.

1:18:15.621 --> 1:18:18.175
If anyone had a chance to see
him slip a key inside a book

1:18:18.176 --> 1:18:20.385
and lock it inside a
drawer, it was you.

1:18:22.352 --> 1:18:25.941
Is that why you killed
him? To get the money?

1:18:28.220 --> 1:18:31.257
I know Potter was secretly
trying to sabotage my work site

1:18:31.258 --> 1:18:33.086
for another kickback.

1:18:33.087 --> 1:18:34.881
What I don't know is if you
were at the Forest House,

1:18:34.882 --> 1:18:36.641
helping him with the sabotage.

1:18:36.642 --> 1:18:38.367
I would never do that.

1:18:38.368 --> 1:18:39.575
I would never do anything

1:18:39.576 --> 1:18:40.818
that would cost
people their homes.

1:18:40.819 --> 1:18:41.786
That's what he did.

1:18:43.201 --> 1:18:45.237
He let the bank take
my father's house.

1:18:46.411 --> 1:18:48.068
Wouldn't lift a
finger to stop it.

1:18:50.070 --> 1:18:52.278
I wouldn't never help that man.

1:18:52.279 --> 1:18:53.831
So if you weren't
there to help him,

1:18:53.832 --> 1:18:55.626
then you must've
followed him there.

1:18:55.627 --> 1:18:59.216
I knew what he was doing
and I was gonna get proof,

1:18:59.217 --> 1:19:01.426
take pictures, expose him.

1:19:02.289 --> 1:19:04.566
Did he catch you? Is that it?

1:19:04.567 --> 1:19:08.363
I hated that man, but I
didn't mean to kill him.

1:19:08.364 --> 1:19:09.537
I had to defend myself.

1:19:12.161 --> 1:19:12.989
Shannon!

1:19:15.820 --> 1:19:17.027
Are you okay?

1:19:17.028 --> 1:19:18.442
Yeah, go
around. I'll follow her.

1:19:18.443 --> 1:19:19.995
Okay.

1:19:29.557 --> 1:19:30.386
Where is she?

1:19:30.387 --> 1:19:31.593
I don't know.

1:19:31.594 --> 1:19:32.837
I think I know where
she was headed.

1:19:36.012 --> 1:19:37.944
It's the place
Drummond mentioned,

1:19:37.945 --> 1:19:40.844
Green Meadows Credit
Union, we're almost there.

1:19:40.845 --> 1:19:42.293
We'll be careful.

1:19:42.294 --> 1:19:43.985
So Tommy looked up
Patrice's father.

1:19:43.986 --> 1:19:46.711
He died a year ago,
just a few months

1:19:46.712 --> 1:19:49.129
after the bank
foreclosed on his house.

1:19:58.103 --> 1:19:59.794
Do you see her?

1:19:59.795 --> 1:20:00.623
Uh-uh.

1:20:04.800 --> 1:20:05.628
There she is.

1:20:15.811 --> 1:20:18.191
Excuse me, do you have
a washroom I could use?

1:20:18.192 --> 1:20:19.331
- Back there.
- Thank you.

1:20:21.057 --> 1:20:23.508
I'll follow her, see if
there's a way out the back.

1:21:04.825 --> 1:21:06.550
Why couldn't you
just leave me alone,

1:21:06.551 --> 1:21:07.621
let me get the money.

1:21:08.967 --> 1:21:10.312
I would've given
most of it back.

1:21:10.313 --> 1:21:11.936
I just needed
enough to get away.

1:21:13.178 --> 1:21:14.765
You don't have to run.

1:21:14.766 --> 1:21:16.215
Not if it was self defense.

1:21:16.216 --> 1:21:17.631
No one's gonna believe me.

1:21:18.908 --> 1:21:19.805
I believe you.

1:21:27.296 --> 1:21:28.744
But I forged Potter's signature

1:21:28.745 --> 1:21:31.575
to get access to his
safe deposit box.

1:21:31.576 --> 1:21:33.991
That makes it look
like I planned it.

1:21:33.992 --> 1:21:37.064
Or it makes it look like you
wanted of what he was doing.

1:21:38.410 --> 1:21:40.240
Patrice listen to me.

1:21:41.724 --> 1:21:44.796
I know that your father died
after the bank took his house.

1:21:46.591 --> 1:21:48.213
It was the shame
that killed him.

1:21:49.387 --> 1:21:50.975
He couldn't bear
to feel such shame.

1:21:52.908 --> 1:21:54.012
And now I understand.

1:22:05.713 --> 1:22:07.645
Patrice, I am on your side.

1:22:07.646 --> 1:22:10.165
I know how much it
hurts to lose someone.

1:22:10.166 --> 1:22:14.583
I understand too, the feeling
of injustice when he died,

1:22:14.584 --> 1:22:16.516
wanting to right that wrong.

1:22:16.517 --> 1:22:18.243
I know it's not your fault.

1:22:20.349 --> 1:22:21.694
Look at me.

1:22:21.695 --> 1:22:23.523
I meant what I said.

1:22:23.524 --> 1:22:25.629
I'll go with you to the police.

1:22:25.630 --> 1:22:27.113
I can help explain.

1:22:27.114 --> 1:22:28.252
I'll talk to them.

1:22:28.253 --> 1:22:29.185
They know me.

1:22:30.048 --> 1:22:32.463
Please let me help you.

1:22:32.464 --> 1:22:34.707
You don't have to do this.

1:22:34.708 --> 1:22:36.917
We can make it right.

1:22:37.953 --> 1:22:41.059
Just talk to me, please.

1:22:42.958 --> 1:22:45.752
No, it's too late.

1:22:45.753 --> 1:22:46.513
No!

1:22:50.655 --> 1:22:52.968
It's all right. It's okay.

1:22:56.281 --> 1:22:57.558
It's all right.

1:23:20.512 --> 1:23:21.996
I know I've said it before,

1:23:21.997 --> 1:23:24.343
but I have to thank you again
for finding out the truth

1:23:24.344 --> 1:23:26.483
and for saving the renovation.

1:23:26.484 --> 1:23:29.624
And your dad tells us you'll
come in right on schedule.

1:23:29.625 --> 1:23:30.557
I think he will.

1:23:30.558 --> 1:23:31.729
I need to thank you too.

1:23:31.730 --> 1:23:33.007
It means the world to me

1:23:33.008 --> 1:23:34.767
that I'll be able to
give my son a home.

1:23:34.768 --> 1:23:36.182
Thank you for all
the volunteer hours

1:23:36.183 --> 1:23:37.666
you've been putting in.

1:23:37.667 --> 1:23:39.841
Oh, hey, if you got a
volunteer job, I'm your man.

1:23:39.842 --> 1:23:40.670
I'll take it.

1:23:40.671 --> 1:23:41.877
Come on, Uncle Mac.

1:23:41.878 --> 1:23:43.051
You can't be late for
your book signing.

1:23:43.052 --> 1:23:44.916
Yeah, Uncle Mac,
your fans are waiting.

1:23:50.335 --> 1:23:51.923
See you guys later.

1:23:53.373 --> 1:23:55.960
Don't tell me the
famous writer is nervous?

1:23:55.961 --> 1:23:59.619
I am, but not about that.

1:23:59.620 --> 1:24:02.209
About, uh, what I
want to tell you.

1:24:03.590 --> 1:24:05.039
What is it?

1:24:06.248 --> 1:24:07.420
You're right.

1:24:07.421 --> 1:24:08.939
Ever since my
wedding that wasn't,

1:24:08.940 --> 1:24:12.426
I've been in no hurry
to start a relationship.

1:24:13.738 --> 1:24:15.015
I understand caution.

1:24:16.051 --> 1:24:18.984
But lately, when I'm with you,

1:24:20.055 --> 1:24:23.989
I'm feeling a
definite impatience.

1:24:25.681 --> 1:24:27.820
The truth is I'm
crazy about you.

1:24:27.821 --> 1:24:29.546
And I know you've
been in no hurry

1:24:29.547 --> 1:24:31.652
to start a relationship and I respect...

1:24:36.623 --> 1:24:38.555
Come on.

1:24:38.556 --> 1:24:39.763
I have to go stand in line

1:24:39.764 --> 1:24:41.800
to get an autograph
from my favorite writer.
