<i>I heard from Kay and Rick
you were sick.</i>

01:45.924 --> 01:48.991
<i>I'm so sorry, I didn't know
that, honey.</i>

01:48.993 --> 01:52.862
<i>I'd love to hear how

01:52.864 --> 01:54.797

cheese burritos, please?</i>

02:00.372 --> 02:02.138
<i>And a small Pepsi.</i>

02:02.140 --> 02:04.006
<i>We don't serve Pepsi, ma'am
we only have coke.</i>

02:04.008 --> 02:05.975
<i>No, no, I always...
Only coke, ma'am.</i>

02:05.977 --> 02:07.777
<i>Cathy

02:07.779 --> 02:11.447

Am I on Eucalyptis?</i>

02:11.449 --> 02:12.849

Oh, right, how sick you are...</i>

02:44.716 --> 02:45.782
Fuck.

03:01.131 --> 03:03.666
There's our New York City boy!

03:03.668 --> 03:05.101
That's right. Hi, grandma.

03:05.103 --> 03:06.969
They gotcha workin' this party?

03:06.971 --> 03:09.906
It's good to work. Good for ya!

03:09.908 --> 03:13.176
You know, I'm glad that you're
movin' home for a bit.

03:13.178 --> 03:17.580
Your mom's gonna need a lotta
help. She does not deserve this.

03:17.582 --> 03:19.782
You know, Rebeccah and Alex
helped set up, too!

03:19.784 --> 03:21.984
We did it all...
You were "writing."

03:21.986 --> 03:23.920
Are you drinking?
You're like 15-years-old.

03:23.922 --> 03:25.855
I'm 17.
Alex, didn't help at all.

03:25.857 --> 03:27.824
You were gone picking up friends
for like five hours.

03:27.826 --> 03:29.492
Please tell me, not Paige.

03:29.494 --> 03:32.161
I haven't talked to Paige since,
like, middle school.

03:32.163 --> 03:34.964
Oh, hey there, is this where
I can get some chips?

03:34.966 --> 03:36.966
Oh!

03:36.968 --> 03:41.671
Oh, hi, my name's Fletcher, just
live here in the neighborhood.

03:41.673 --> 03:43.193
Hi, Fletcher.
Hoping to get some chips.

03:47.912 --> 03:49.545
Oh, my god.
That's funny.

03:49.547 --> 03:51.481
Isn't that great?
99 cents at the gas station.

03:51.483 --> 03:52.782
99 cents.
Isn't that something?

03:52.784 --> 03:55.751
David! David, what do you hear
about your show?

03:55.753 --> 03:57.553
Uh, it didn't get picked up...

03:57.555 --> 04:00.656
So they don't pick it up,
you know, it's over.

04:00.658 --> 04:03.659
Yeah, but ya never know, maybe
they'll change their minds!

04:03.661 --> 04:05.795
That's not really how it works.

04:05.797 --> 04:08.231
Ya know, we turned on SNL
the other week...

04:08.233 --> 04:09.832
Lookin' for ya on there!

04:09.834 --> 04:12.768
Uh, why? I don't work there.

04:12.770 --> 04:16.539
Well, it's only a matter of time
before we see ya on there!

04:16.541 --> 04:19.742
Well, I'm a writer, so I'd never
actually be like,<i> on</i> the show...

04:19.744 --> 04:22.678
Sure you're gonna get a lot
of material tonight.

04:22.680 --> 04:24.547
Won't he, grandpa?

04:24.549 --> 04:26.849
I'll give you some material.
Whaddya need?

04:26.851 --> 04:28.150
David!

04:28.152 --> 04:29.852
You just need these.
This is a sketch.

04:29.854 --> 04:31.787
David?
Give these to Lorne Michaels.

04:31.789 --> 04:33.589
Okay, I gotta show you this.

04:33.591 --> 04:36.659
Remember that wand that I bought
on the Internet?

04:36.661 --> 04:37.960
The one that can heal people?

04:37.962 --> 04:40.897
Yes, and can you believe
at only $400?

04:40.899 --> 04:42.031
I mean, that's crazy.

04:42.033 --> 04:43.666
Everyone at your church
bought one?

04:43.668 --> 04:46.002
Yeah, well, my pastor sells them
on his website.

04:46.004 --> 04:50.172
And, uh, anyway, I looked it up,
and it <i> doesn't</i> cure cancer.

04:50.174 --> 04:51.941
Well...

04:51.943 --> 04:54.176
Yeah, so it just works on, if
you like, throw your back out...

04:54.178 --> 04:56.045
Or something, but boy,
is it amazing.

04:56.047 --> 04:58.281
Thanks for researching that,
that's good to know.

04:58.283 --> 05:01.551
How you doin', Sacramento?
Here it comes...

05:04.021 --> 05:07.156
We were gonna dedicate this
first song to Joanne...

05:07.158 --> 05:09.926
But she's still upstairs
gettin' ready apparently.

05:09.928 --> 05:12.562
So get your butt down here,
Joanne!

05:12.564 --> 05:15.298
Jo-anny! Come on down!
Hey, Joanne!

05:15.300 --> 05:19.969
Well, we got our New York City
boy in the house tonight.

05:19.971 --> 05:22.338
You're not too good for us now,
are you?

05:22.340 --> 05:25.141
No.
Okay.

05:25.143 --> 05:28.044
We're gonna start you off
with a lil' appetizer.

05:58.742 --> 06:00.776
I'm almost ready, I'm so sorry!

06:00.778 --> 06:02.144
No, no rush.

06:02.146 --> 06:05.381
Taking me forever.
Sit down for one minute.

06:08.719 --> 06:10.353
How's it going down there?

06:10.355 --> 06:12.088
Patti brought her wand.

06:12.090 --> 06:16.225
She did? Of course, she did!
Hm...

06:16.227 --> 06:18.027
She says it doesn't work
on cancer, though.

06:18.029 --> 06:19.161
Darn!

06:21.698 --> 06:23.699
Don't bite.

06:23.701 --> 06:26.002
Isn't this dress pretty?

06:26.004 --> 06:31.741
It is, I feel like it's too
subtle... maybe?

06:31.743 --> 06:32.875
Yeah, you think so?

06:32.877 --> 06:34.844
Something more, maybe?

06:34.846 --> 06:36.178
Do you know that I got this
dress for this '70s party...

06:36.180 --> 06:37.680
That your dad dragged me to.

06:37.682 --> 06:38.648
Did I ever tell you about
that party?

06:38.650 --> 06:40.282
No.

06:40.284 --> 06:42.084
Well, it was for people at his
school, so you get the idea.

06:42.086 --> 06:43.119
It's like, you know,
you think he's bad...

06:43.121 --> 06:45.054
These people are the worst.

06:45.056 --> 06:47.056
So your dad makes this big deal,
like we have to get our 70's co-

06:47.058 --> 06:49.091
like he was very excited
about this party.

06:49.093 --> 06:50.993
So I get this dress,
which is beautiful.

06:50.995 --> 06:52.962
We go to the party,
we walk in...

06:52.964 --> 06:55.798
And literally <i> no one</i> is dressed
up in 70's costumes...

06:55.800 --> 06:58.200
Except for me and your father,
can you imagine?

06:58.202 --> 07:00.870
Oh, my god.
It was so embarrassing.

07:00.872 --> 07:02.171
Why was I not there?
No one, David!

07:02.173 --> 07:04.206
God as my witness.
I don't know.

07:04.208 --> 07:06.776
These people... they had
like one little...

07:06.778 --> 07:10.012
One little banner that said
"groovy", and then they were...

07:10.014 --> 07:11.380
They didn't even play
70's music...

07:11.382 --> 07:13.249
They were playing like
Phil Collins music.

07:13.251 --> 07:15.951
Ugh.
I'm so sorry, that sucks!

07:15.953 --> 07:17.987
I know, but it's so funny
in retrospect.

07:17.989 --> 07:19.255
So has everyone already
left yet?

07:19.257 --> 07:23.025
Actually you missed
the whole year.

07:23.027 --> 07:26.462
It's probably not a terrible
idea.

07:26.464 --> 07:28.964
Should we go down?
And join?

07:32.703 --> 07:34.770
You don't have to move back,
you know that, right?

07:34.772 --> 07:35.871
I know.

07:35.873 --> 07:38.340
I just want to tell you.
I know.

07:38.342 --> 07:41.377
Don't bite, David, stop,
come on.

08:16.881 --> 08:18.814
<i>Paul hey, this is Paul.</i>

08:18.816 --> 08:22.518
<i>I'm not here right now, so
leave a message after the beep.</i>

08:22.520 --> 08:26.188
Hey, it's me.

08:26.190 --> 08:31.427
Just calling
to say that I landed.

08:31.429 --> 08:34.330
And um...

08:34.332 --> 08:39.101
Which I guess I don't need
to do that... any more.

08:39.102 --> 08:41.937
Anyway. Yeah, mom's fine.

08:41.938 --> 08:46.442
Or... you know, fake fine, um...

08:46.444 --> 08:50.146
We're just all doing
new year's stuff.

08:50.148 --> 08:53.015
Sorta feels like this little
play that we're all putting on.

08:53.017 --> 08:55.918
Boo!
Agh! Fuck!

09:19.176 --> 09:25.080
Uh, hey, you holding up?

09:25.082 --> 09:27.516
Yeah.

09:30.187 --> 09:32.588
You want company?

09:33.890 --> 09:35.357
No, thank you.

09:39.462 --> 09:43.032
Got any new year's resolutions?

09:47.170 --> 09:49.839
I dunno.

09:49.841 --> 09:54.076
All right, I love you, bud.

09:57.981 --> 10:02.051
10... 9... 8... 7...

10:02.053 --> 10:06.088
6... 5... 4... 3...

10:06.090 --> 10:08.424
2... 1...

10:22.038 --> 10:23.639
Okay.

10:29.012 --> 10:30.079
Are you okay?

10:30.081 --> 10:31.614
I'm so sorry, I missed a little.

10:31.616 --> 10:34.016
That's okay.
Yeah, I'm okay, I'm okay.

10:37.354 --> 10:39.188
Thank you, thank you, honey.

11:27.404 --> 11:30.406
So, how's Paul doing?

11:30.408 --> 11:33.709
This is a long time for you
to be away from him.

11:33.711 --> 11:38.547
He understands. He's fine.
Oh, good.

11:38.549 --> 11:39.949
Well, listen, I really wanna
pay for your rent...

11:39.951 --> 11:41.617
For the next few months...

11:41.619 --> 11:44.620
Just so it's one less thing
for you guys to worry about.

11:44.622 --> 11:46.221
Dad's not gonna like that.

11:46.223 --> 11:48.958
Well, I don't care
if he likes it.

11:48.960 --> 11:50.459
Well, thank you.

11:50.461 --> 11:52.461
Of course.

11:52.463 --> 11:55.698
Have you used that gym
membership that he got you?

11:55.700 --> 11:57.533
Might be nice for you
to have somewhere to go...

11:57.535 --> 11:58.600
If you want to get outta
the house at night.

11:58.602 --> 12:00.569
I will, yeah.

12:00.571 --> 12:02.304
Okay, good.

12:02.306 --> 12:03.739
Work on my fitness.

12:03.741 --> 12:06.008
Yeah... can you see it?

12:06.010 --> 12:09.645
Hm?
Can you see it?

12:09.647 --> 12:12.481
No, looks normal.

12:12.483 --> 12:16.151
Ah, hooray.

12:52.088 --> 12:53.455
Hey! David?

12:53.457 --> 12:54.690
David? Mulcahey?

12:54.692 --> 12:57.292
Oh... hey!
Hey! I thought that was you.

12:57.294 --> 12:59.661
Hey, how's it goin?
Good, good.

12:59.663 --> 13:01.196
Just baggin...

13:01.198 --> 13:02.798
Oh... wow.
Yeah.

13:02.800 --> 13:05.067
That's cool.
Yeah, it's good to see you!

13:05.069 --> 13:07.636
Yeah, I saw on Facebook,
you're a writer now, right?

13:07.638 --> 13:10.205
Yeah.
Cool, cool, me, too.

13:10.207 --> 13:11.340
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

13:11.342 --> 13:15.077
Like novels and Sci-Fi
fantasy shit.

13:15.079 --> 13:17.112
Oh, okay.
Yeah, it's fun.

13:17.114 --> 13:18.180
Well, cool.

13:18.182 --> 13:20.082
Yeah, what are you writing?

13:20.084 --> 13:23.318
Uh, I was working on this pilot
for TV for like a year.

13:23.320 --> 13:24.620
Okay.

13:24.622 --> 13:30.225
But... Then it didn't get
picked up, so...

13:30.227 --> 13:33.395
Now I'm just writing
for "Saturday night live".

13:33.397 --> 13:35.697
Oh, fuck, what? Are you...

13:35.699 --> 13:37.566
Oh, my god... shit.
Yeah.

13:37.568 --> 13:39.301
I should probably... I should
probably get going.

13:39.303 --> 13:41.470
Yeah, yeah, hey, you know, um...

13:41.472 --> 13:44.139
I've been meaning
to message you.

13:44.141 --> 13:47.409
I uh, I heard about your
family situation. Uh...

13:47.411 --> 13:48.710
Yeah.
Yeah.

13:48.712 --> 13:50.546
How are your sisters doing?

13:50.548 --> 13:55.184
I mean, everyone's sad, but you
know...

13:55.186 --> 13:58.554
Really? I didn't think
Rebeccah would care...

13:58.556 --> 14:00.823
And your little sister.

14:00.825 --> 14:02.458
Wait, what are you
talking about?

14:02.460 --> 14:05.160
You know, you... Michelle Lima
said that you came out?

14:05.162 --> 14:08.597
And your family kind of took it
poorly or something like that?

14:08.599 --> 14:14.403
Yeah, that was like
nine years ago or something.

14:14.405 --> 14:16.105
I mean, my dad still won't talk
about it...

14:16.107 --> 14:18.640
But he's a fucking asshole, so...

14:18.642 --> 14:21.443
Wait, what were you talking
about?

14:21.445 --> 14:27.182
Oh, uh, now my mom has cancer.

14:28.685 --> 14:31.587
But...

14:31.589 --> 14:33.622
You should rent her a DVD.

14:33.624 --> 14:34.857
No, no, that's okay.

14:34.859 --> 14:36.892
No, have you seen these things?

14:36.894 --> 14:39.194
They're like Netflix, but even
better, they're awesome.

14:39.196 --> 14:40.696
I have.
Come on.

14:40.698 --> 14:43.132
I got an employee discount.
Man, it's not a big deal.

14:43.134 --> 14:44.833
I can get you a free rental.

14:44.835 --> 14:46.702
You really don't have to do
that. They're only a dollar. I...

14:46.704 --> 14:48.704
No, no, come on, hey, please,
let me get you something.

14:48.706 --> 14:51.607
Do you know if there's any
non-new releases...

14:51.609 --> 14:52.908
That she'd want to see?

14:52.910 --> 14:55.878
Ooh, ooh, okay, watch your hair.

14:55.880 --> 15:00.215
Good girl, get it out,
get it out.

15:00.217 --> 15:02.584
Just breathe, mom.

15:02.586 --> 15:06.221
Here we go. You're doing
all right, baby.

15:08.758 --> 15:10.926
Thank you, sweetie.

15:10.928 --> 15:13.529
You okay, mom?
David, yeah, I'm okay.

15:13.531 --> 15:17.599
How was your day?
Get any writing done?

15:17.601 --> 15:19.368
Um, a lot, actually.

15:19.370 --> 15:22.504
Hey, you know that gym has
boxing classes.

15:22.506 --> 15:24.439
I thought that might be fun!

15:24.441 --> 15:26.608
Can someone please put dono
outside?

15:26.610 --> 15:28.710
I can't stand to see him
licking his penis.

15:28.712 --> 15:31.246
Dono, no! Stop it!
Dono, no, stop!

15:31.248 --> 15:32.714
Dono, no!
Dono, out!

15:32.716 --> 15:33.849
Stop.
No!

15:48.898 --> 15:50.799
<i>Gabe David, hi, it's Gabe.</i>

15:50.801 --> 15:52.834
<i>I am in town and want you to
know that we are going...</i>

15:52.836 --> 15:54.536
<i>To the gayest bar in Sacramento
tonight.</i>

15:54.538 --> 15:56.338
<i>You, of course, have no choice.</i>

15:56.340 --> 15:58.740
<i>Please pick me up promptly,
thank you, goodbye.</i>

16:01.578 --> 16:03.212
Oh, hey.

16:03.214 --> 16:06.982
Oh, uh, hi. I'm looking
for Gabe Stewart?

16:06.984 --> 16:09.818
Oh, he's in the shower, yeah.
David, right?

16:09.820 --> 16:11.620
What, you're Justin?
The only and only!

16:11.622 --> 16:14.256
Except for Timberlake and
Bieber, but whatever.

16:14.258 --> 16:16.592
You were a baby like
a second ago!

16:16.594 --> 16:19.361
You can come in and wait
in my room if you want.

16:19.363 --> 16:23.432
Just know that I know,
it needs of a full redec.

16:23.434 --> 16:25.500
Okay.
Who am I kidding?

16:25.502 --> 16:27.502
This whole house needs
a full redec, honestly.

16:27.504 --> 16:28.737
Yeah, I won't judge it.

16:28.739 --> 16:31.540
This is my bedroom.

16:31.542 --> 16:33.508
Wow! This is really nice.

16:33.510 --> 16:35.277
Do you like it?
I do.

16:35.279 --> 16:38.614
So for my birthday, I wanna tear
down this whole entire wall...

16:38.616 --> 16:40.349
And put up solid Carrera.

16:40.351 --> 16:42.284
Do you know Carrera?

16:42.286 --> 16:43.719
I think... is she like a singer?

16:43.721 --> 16:45.854
No, it's a marble, it's so
tasteful.

16:45.856 --> 16:47.589
I actually think you'll
really like it.

16:47.591 --> 16:49.424
See this laptop case?
Uh-huh.

16:49.426 --> 16:50.692
It's Carrera.

16:50.694 --> 16:52.894
Oh, wow, that's really nice.
Yeah.

16:52.896 --> 16:54.963
It's fake, but it'll do.

16:54.965 --> 16:56.498
My tastes are a little bit
outside my father's...

16:56.500 --> 16:59.001
Financial means, and I'm
sensitive to that.

16:59.003 --> 17:01.703
And he works so hard, he's
a single parent...

17:01.705 --> 17:03.272
So I try to cut corners
where I can.

17:03.274 --> 17:04.973
That's really nice of you.

17:04.974 --> 17:06.907
I really like your shirt,
by the way.

17:06.910 --> 17:08.710
Oh, well, thank you...

17:08.712 --> 17:11.480
I was actually very nervous
about it since meeting you.

17:11.482 --> 17:13.548
It's so cute, you're really
cute.

17:14.584 --> 17:17.386
David. Hi!
Gabe.

17:17.387 --> 17:19.021
How are you?

17:19.022 --> 17:21.656
I'm good. A very young boy
just told me I looked cute.

17:21.659 --> 17:24.326
Yes, he did, I'm not surprised.

17:24.328 --> 17:26.395
Um, Justin, we're gonna go, be
good.

17:26.396 --> 17:28.396
Uh, of course, I'll be good,
please, please.

17:28.398 --> 17:29.731
It was so nice to meet you.

17:29.733 --> 17:31.333
It was so nice to meet you.

17:31.335 --> 17:33.735
Come on, hug me. Let's do this.

17:33.737 --> 17:35.570
Thank you.

17:35.572 --> 17:37.005
Ah, Justin, I'm so sorry,
you can't come with us.

17:37.007 --> 17:38.807
Oh, no, it's fine,
I have work to do.

17:38.809 --> 17:41.376
Honestly, just please go off,
have fun, do your thing.

17:41.378 --> 17:43.045
We will. And, Justin, please
don't burn the house down...

17:43.047 --> 17:44.646
With your candles while
I'm gone.

17:44.648 --> 17:46.815
Oh, my god, Gabe, please stop!

17:46.817 --> 17:48.650
I'm sorry, I'm joking.
I'm joking.

17:48.652 --> 17:51.386
He's furious, because he ran out
of candles this afternoon.

17:51.388 --> 17:54.356
Ho-ly shit.

17:54.358 --> 17:57.959
I can't believe your dad has to
raise <i> that</i> kid all by himself.

17:57.961 --> 17:59.728
Okay, remember junior year...

17:59.730 --> 18:02.931
How my mom got sick like five
minutes after they adopted him?

18:06.103 --> 18:08.503
Okay wait, so where are we
going?

18:08.505 --> 18:09.938
I didn't even know
Sacramento had gay bars.

18:09.940 --> 18:12.074
Oh, you'll see,
it's... pure heaven.

18:15.746 --> 18:20.816
This is hand's down the worst
building I've ever been in.

18:20.818 --> 18:23.485
Okay, you say that now, but if
you meet your husband here,

18:23.487 --> 18:25.127
I'm gonna make the speech
at your wedding.

18:26.689 --> 18:31.460
Uh, let me toast now, um, to
being back home.

18:31.462 --> 18:34.096
Mm, to being in Sacramento.

18:34.098 --> 18:36.798
Don't be rude, David.
Okay, this is your home.

18:36.800 --> 18:39.101
Your gorgeous, gorgeous home.

18:39.103 --> 18:41.770
Okay, you can say that, because
you're here for the weekend.

18:41.772 --> 18:43.071
I have been here two months.

18:43.073 --> 18:44.706
No, it's true, it's not fair.

18:44.708 --> 18:46.041
I don't have to deal with your
fucking dad.

18:46.043 --> 18:47.776
I mean, he's been good
with my mom.

18:47.778 --> 18:50.479
We just don't talk about that.

18:50.481 --> 18:52.647
That? So you mean, how he cut
you off and made you pay...

18:52.649 --> 18:53.715
For school when you came
out to him?

18:53.717 --> 18:55.617
Yes, that!

18:55.619 --> 18:57.152
Right, how he's never seen Paul.
How he's never met Paul once.

18:57.154 --> 18:58.987
That!
Right, right, right, that, that.

18:58.989 --> 19:00.622
Yes, that.
What is this, 2008?

19:00.624 --> 19:02.157
Jesus. I feel like I'm in
brokeback mountain.

19:02.159 --> 19:03.425
I know.

19:05.161 --> 19:07.095
Hi.

19:07.097 --> 19:08.897
Hi.

19:08.899 --> 19:12.534
Do you teach, or...?

19:12.536 --> 19:14.536
You don't know?
You don't know?

19:14.538 --> 19:18.006
Okay... um, how are you
and Paul? Is it weird now?

19:18.008 --> 19:19.775
It was mutual.
Yeah.

19:19.777 --> 19:21.143
So mutually... weird.
Yeah.

19:21.145 --> 19:22.677
I guess.

19:22.679 --> 19:24.146
How long were you all together,
like four years?

19:24.148 --> 19:25.614
Five.
Oh, god!

19:25.616 --> 19:26.681
Oh, god.

19:26.683 --> 19:27.682
What the fuck?
Hi.

19:27.684 --> 19:28.684
Hi.

19:30.187 --> 19:31.887
You should do grindr
while you're here.

19:31.889 --> 19:33.722
I would never do grindr...

19:33.724 --> 19:35.457
Especially in Sacramento.

19:35.459 --> 19:36.758
That's disgusting.
What?

19:36.760 --> 19:39.060
You should try ok cupid, come on!

19:39.062 --> 19:42.431
It's more gentle, it's like
for small children.

19:42.433 --> 19:44.099
No.
Why? What?

19:44.101 --> 19:45.467
What's wrong with ok cupid?

19:45.469 --> 19:47.035
I do it every time I'm home.

19:47.037 --> 19:49.604
I hooked up with that guy from
Sheldon...

19:49.606 --> 19:51.540
Who was a year younger than us,
Nate chapin?

19:51.542 --> 19:52.941
Nate chapin?
Mm-hm.

19:52.943 --> 19:53.975
How was that?

19:53.977 --> 19:55.844
He had the grossest penis...

19:55.846 --> 19:57.112
But he lived right next
to Jack in the box...

19:57.114 --> 20:00.682
So two birds, one dick.

20:00.684 --> 20:03.919
<i>Ugh! I'm gonna come so hard!</i>
Ew. Oh my god, oh my god!

20:03.921 --> 20:05.787
<i>I'm gonna come all over the
place.</i>

20:07.857 --> 20:10.659
That is definitely the guy
from the burger place!

20:10.661 --> 20:11.793
Yes, I told you.

20:11.795 --> 20:13.762
How did you recognize him?

20:13.764 --> 20:16.765
Because look at that dumb-ass
tattoo on his arm.

20:16.767 --> 20:18.133
I mean, who else has that
tattoo. No one has that tattoo.

20:18.135 --> 20:20.035
<i>Fuck, yeah.</i>
Oh, he's gonna do it.

20:20.037 --> 20:21.970
He's gonna do it.

20:21.972 --> 20:23.738
<i>Nothing will be spared in here.</i>
He's close, he's close!

20:23.740 --> 20:24.706
<i>I'm gonna come all over the
whole room.</i>

20:24.708 --> 20:27.676
He came!
He did it!

20:27.678 --> 20:29.878
Yes! He did it!
He came on the chair!

20:29.880 --> 20:31.713
Hey, thank you.

20:31.715 --> 20:34.716
And she didn't wanna slowly lose
her hair, so she shaved it.

20:34.718 --> 20:40.222
Last week... and we did this big
hair-cutting ceremony...

20:40.224 --> 20:42.123
And she was really joke-y
and funny...

20:42.125 --> 20:44.659
And then when it was over,
she started crying.

20:44.661 --> 20:46.027
My mom did the same thing.

20:46.029 --> 20:48.029
The chemo's not even working.

20:48.031 --> 20:52.868
And it's like now I'll have no
mom, and basically no dad...

20:52.870 --> 20:55.904
And no boyfriend, and no job...

20:55.906 --> 20:58.940
No, no, no, David, you came
here to be with her.

20:58.942 --> 21:00.742
Just focus on that.

21:00.744 --> 21:03.211
That's all, and let everything
else fall into place, okay?

21:03.213 --> 21:06.515
There's no one to fucking talk
to here, except for you...

21:06.517 --> 21:07.983
And you're never here.

21:07.985 --> 21:10.151
So I just said, and I think
about morbid shit...

21:10.153 --> 21:12.954
Like, where will I be
when she dies?

21:12.956 --> 21:14.189
How are your sisters?

21:14.191 --> 21:16.157
Will it be summer or winter?

21:16.159 --> 21:21.229
Or like, will September 27th
just always suck...

21:21.231 --> 21:22.697
For the rest of my life?

21:22.699 --> 21:25.066
I don't know.

21:25.068 --> 21:27.035
This all just feels like...

21:27.037 --> 21:30.238
Something that happens
to other people.

21:30.240 --> 21:33.975
Yeah, well, now you're other
people to other people.

22:17.987 --> 22:22.257
All right, we have two burgers,
two fries, and two cokes.

22:22.259 --> 22:24.726
It'll be about five minutes,
we'll bring it right out to you.

22:27.096 --> 22:29.898
Hi. What can I get you?

22:29.900 --> 22:32.167
I like your tattoo.

22:32.169 --> 22:35.837
Oh, eh, it's like how we're all
created, you know?

22:35.839 --> 22:38.073
Yeah.
Yeah.

22:38.075 --> 22:39.908
What can I get you?

22:39.910 --> 22:43.945
Um, yeah, I'll just do three
medium chocolate shakes...

22:43.947 --> 22:45.914
With no whip cream... please?

22:45.916 --> 22:47.882
What size?

22:47.884 --> 22:49.651
Medium.

22:49.653 --> 22:51.820
And would you like
whip cream on that?

22:51.822 --> 22:54.389
No, no whip.

22:54.391 --> 22:55.957
And what flavor?

22:55.959 --> 22:57.692
Chocolate.

22:57.694 --> 22:59.227
Chocolate, great.

22:59.229 --> 23:04.099
Three medium no whip
chocolate shakes. What size?

23:04.101 --> 23:07.235
Okie-doke...

23:07.237 --> 23:10.238
I still feel like Alex and Becca
should be here if they want to.

23:10.240 --> 23:12.974
No, I don't want them
to hear this.

23:12.976 --> 23:15.276
But they might want to.
No.

23:15.278 --> 23:18.179
No, I don't want them here. No.

23:18.181 --> 23:24.886
Okay, um, obviously this is just
precautionary.

23:24.888 --> 23:28.256
It's actually important that we
all have one of these.

23:28.258 --> 23:30.759
Even you should have one,
I can help you fill it out...

23:30.761 --> 23:32.160
Later if you want.

23:34.096 --> 23:37.132
You look good!
You enjoying the gym?

23:37.134 --> 23:39.901
Yeah.
Cool.

23:39.903 --> 23:43.071
Okay, section one,
designation of agent...

23:43.073 --> 23:46.975
I've designated myself as agent.

23:46.977 --> 23:49.978
It just means that I would be
making health care decisions...

23:49.980 --> 23:51.413
If mom can't.

23:51.415 --> 23:53.314
Meaning he can kill me.

23:53.316 --> 23:58.887
Yeah, yeah, as soon as I get my
info down here, I can kill her.

23:58.889 --> 24:00.922
And, if it's okay with you...

24:00.924 --> 24:05.794
You are designated first
alternate agent...

24:05.796 --> 24:09.931
It just means you're my
second in command.

24:09.933 --> 24:12.100
No, I don't want him in that
position.

24:12.102 --> 24:14.402
Joanne, it's precautionary.
Absolutely not, no.

24:14.404 --> 24:16.738
No, sorry, then put Nina down.
It's not gonna happen.

24:16.740 --> 24:18.373
Mom, it's really fine.

24:18.375 --> 24:20.341
It's not fine. You should not
have to be put in that position.

24:20.343 --> 24:22.177
No, the answer is no.

24:22.179 --> 24:27.716
Okay, if you want Nina,
we'll do Nina.

24:27.718 --> 24:31.986
Uh, section 2.1,
end-of-life decisions.

24:31.988 --> 24:34.255
"Donation of organs at death".

24:34.257 --> 24:36.391
Do you want to be an
organ donor?

24:36.393 --> 24:38.960
No, I don't want to...
Who's gonna want my organs?

24:38.962 --> 24:41.096
My organs have tumors
all over them.

24:41.098 --> 24:47.068
Your eyes, you could do your
eyes, pretty blue eyes.

24:47.070 --> 24:49.237
All right, fine, my eyes.

24:51.407 --> 24:53.975
Okay, I'll make sure about that.

24:53.977 --> 25:01.977
Here's another fun topic,
um... cremation?

25:02.052 --> 25:04.853
No, I'm not get... we talked
about this.

25:04.855 --> 25:06.321
I know we talked about it,
I just want to...

25:06.323 --> 25:08.123
I'm not gonna be burned up,
okay?

25:08.125 --> 25:11.392
How would you like it if someone
set you on fire? No, thank you.

25:11.394 --> 25:14.496
Well, it's not like they light
you, I mean, you're...

25:14.498 --> 25:17.332
I don't want to be lit on fire.
I don't like that.

25:17.334 --> 25:19.300
I don't like camping and I don't
like fires...

25:19.302 --> 25:22.871
And I don't want to
be personally lit on fire, no.

25:22.873 --> 25:24.939
I want to be frozen. Do they
have that as an option?

25:24.941 --> 25:26.508
Frozen, can I be frozen?

25:26.510 --> 25:28.276
You want to be frozen?
Check the frozen option.

25:28.278 --> 25:31.045
Frozen like a pea?
Yeah, exactly, like a pea.

25:31.047 --> 25:32.547
Um...

25:32.549 --> 25:34.449
I want to be frozen and then
propped up on our couch...

25:34.451 --> 25:36.317
In our living room, and I can
watch you to make sure...

25:36.319 --> 25:37.318
You don't cheat on me
when I'm gone.

25:37.320 --> 25:39.287
You're gonna...

25:39.289 --> 25:41.122
You think it's funny,
but that's what I'm gonna do.

25:41.124 --> 25:43.424
But you won't have eyes,
because you donated your eyes.

25:43.426 --> 25:46.127
Mm, that's too bad, then I guess
I'll be buried.

25:46.129 --> 25:48.963
Okay, just hear me out on this.

25:51.300 --> 25:54.002
Burial, you know, it's...

25:54.004 --> 25:55.303
What?

25:55.305 --> 25:59.574
Think about it, I mean,
the coffin, a plot...

25:59.576 --> 26:01.943
I mean, do we really want
to do all that?

26:01.945 --> 26:03.578
What? Norman...
I mean, that's what they did...

26:03.580 --> 26:06.114
No. I don't want to
talk about this anymore.

26:06.116 --> 26:07.515
Olden times.
I don't care if it's olden...

26:07.517 --> 26:09.217
I just think...
I like the olden times.

26:09.219 --> 26:12.453
We could scatter your ashes
someplace meaningful.

26:12.455 --> 26:14.322
No.
I think it could be beautiful.

26:14.324 --> 26:16.124
Why are you trying to make me
mad, Norman, I keep saying no!

26:16.126 --> 26:17.926
I'm not!
And you're pushing me.

26:17.928 --> 26:20.962
Please stop, I told you,
I don't want to be cremated.

26:20.964 --> 26:22.564
And I don't care if you think
it's a dumb idea!

26:22.566 --> 26:25.166
I do not want to be cremated,
okay? I don't like it.

26:25.168 --> 26:27.068
It makes me uncomfortable.
Okay.

26:27.070 --> 26:29.170
I don't like it, I have a right
to say that I don't...

26:29.172 --> 26:30.872
I don't fucking want to be
fucking cremated.

26:30.874 --> 26:34.976
Okay, baby. Okay.
I'm sorry.

26:34.978 --> 26:38.146
And I hate this stupid wig, I
look like a fucking dead person.

26:43.285 --> 26:45.987
You don't have to be cremated.

26:45.989 --> 26:48.590
Okay, good. I don't want
to be cremated.

26:53.495 --> 26:56.631
We could do a green burial?

26:56.633 --> 26:59.934
It's this thing I saw on
"six feet under".

26:59.936 --> 27:03.238
It's like a burial, but they...

27:03.240 --> 27:07.475
There's no coffin, or plot,
it's totally natural.

27:07.477 --> 27:10.511
They just put you in the
earth...

27:10.513 --> 27:14.382
In like a pretty park or
something.

27:14.384 --> 27:17.452
Good, I want to do that.
I want to do David's idea.

27:17.454 --> 27:19.420
Okay, we'll do that.
Okay.

27:19.422 --> 27:21.322
We'll go green.

27:24.193 --> 27:26.027
I'll figure that out.

27:26.029 --> 27:28.196
I don't wanna come to this
stupid place anymore...

27:28.198 --> 27:30.665
Because that guy is literally
doing that the whole time.

27:33.136 --> 27:35.136
Ridiculous.

27:38.241 --> 27:40.441
I hate this.
I know.

27:44.079 --> 27:47.115
I hate it! I told her
not to do the arm.

27:47.117 --> 27:49.017
I told her that there's
no veins there.

27:49.019 --> 27:50.518
I told her to try the hand.

27:50.520 --> 27:52.587
But she still did the arm, and
she kept poking me.

27:52.589 --> 27:55.390
Baby, we do not... listen...

27:55.392 --> 27:57.125
I'm sorry.

27:57.127 --> 27:58.526
We don't have to do this
anymore.

27:58.528 --> 28:02.096
No, I don't want them
to see me quit.

28:02.098 --> 28:04.399
Well, then, take this one...
Nobody's quitting.

28:04.401 --> 28:06.601
Listen to me, this is what
we're going to do.

28:06.603 --> 28:08.202
We're gonna do one more round...
No.

28:08.204 --> 28:10.505
And we're gonna see
how you feel, okay?

28:10.507 --> 28:12.006
That's what we're gonna do,
okay?

28:12.008 --> 28:14.375
Well, why do they keep
getting bigger?

28:14.377 --> 28:17.278
Why do they keep getting bigger?
I don't know.

28:22.184 --> 28:24.385
I think we need to think
about the port.

28:24.387 --> 28:26.187
No, I don't wanna look
like a robot.

28:26.189 --> 28:28.256
You're not gonna look
like a robot, baby.

28:28.258 --> 28:30.191
I don't want to look
like a robot!

28:30.193 --> 28:32.026
You're not gonna be able
to see it.

28:32.028 --> 28:34.395
The doctor said it would be
totally covered by your shirt.

28:34.397 --> 28:37.198
No.
Honey...

28:38.600 --> 28:41.302
I hate this.
I know.

28:45.708 --> 28:47.408
<i>Rachel ray yum, yum, and yum...</i>

28:47.410 --> 28:49.210
<i>So now we're gonna take our
chicken...</i>

28:49.212 --> 28:51.379
<i>With the cheese literally
coming out the sides.</i>

28:51.381 --> 28:53.214
<i>I know!</i>

28:53.216 --> 28:55.516
<i>Note to self, don't put your
kitchen towel...</i>

28:55.518 --> 28:57.018
<i>Too close to the stove.</i>

29:00.022 --> 29:02.256
You know, your mother was
supposed to be born dead.

29:02.258 --> 29:04.993
So she's still very, very lucky.

29:04.995 --> 29:06.160
Oh, grandpa!

29:06.162 --> 29:09.430
It's true. Ask her doctor!

29:09.432 --> 29:12.734
I mean, he's dead, but if he
wasn't, you could.

29:12.736 --> 29:14.635
He hung himself.

29:14.637 --> 29:18.740
See, grandma was already
pregnant and somehow she got...

29:18.742 --> 29:21.009
Pregnant again with your mother,

29:21.011 --> 29:26.247
and your mother absorbed the
first child in the womb.

29:26.249 --> 29:27.782
That's true.

29:27.784 --> 29:30.184
The doctor thought your mom was
either gonna be born dead...

29:30.186 --> 29:35.289
Or with the other baby's hands
comin' outta her face.

29:35.291 --> 29:37.191
Grandpa!

29:37.193 --> 29:40.695
It's true, Ruthie! God as my
witness. But she didn't.

29:40.697 --> 29:44.632
No, she didn't. Her face was
fine. You've seen it.

29:44.634 --> 29:46.467
Yes. I've seen it.

29:46.469 --> 29:48.503
But she does got those
big bunions!

29:48.505 --> 29:51.139
Those could be her sister!

29:51.141 --> 29:52.573
Oh, god.

29:54.143 --> 29:55.810
Where are the girls?

29:55.812 --> 29:59.814
Um, I think Alex and her friends
went to Rebecca's work to eat...

29:59.816 --> 30:02.483
And then they were going
to a concert or something.

30:02.485 --> 30:05.053
Well, why didn't you go
with them?

30:05.055 --> 30:06.287
I was just feelin' kind
of out of it.

30:06.289 --> 30:11.125
Well, you still shoulda gone!

30:11.127 --> 30:13.261
I'm gonna use the bathroom.
Okay.

30:13.263 --> 30:15.696
He's a nice boy.
He's a great boy.

30:15.698 --> 30:17.665
He looks good, too.

30:23.505 --> 30:26.207
Oh, David...

30:26.209 --> 30:29.310
Did you hear what happened
to Mary Elsenpeter?

30:29.312 --> 30:33.281
Uh... No! I'm in the bathroom!

30:33.283 --> 30:37.218
Her family lives in that red
cabin down on ten mile?

30:37.220 --> 30:39.220
Well, she got her head
got torn off.

30:39.222 --> 30:42.090
Grandpa! He's in the
bathroom.

30:42.092 --> 30:44.459
Well, it's true.
It is true!

30:44.461 --> 30:49.230
It got torn right off!
Yeah.

30:49.232 --> 30:52.533
Poor thing, she had just
gotten into Bemidji state!

30:52.535 --> 30:55.670
Crazy.
Yeah.

30:55.672 --> 30:58.773
She was swimming and a boat
decapitated her.

30:58.775 --> 31:02.777
But she didn't die right away,
she swam around for an hour.

31:02.779 --> 31:05.813
Oh! Maybe a minute or two.
No, no!

31:05.815 --> 31:08.349
At least a half-hour!
No.

31:08.351 --> 31:11.619
The medic said she was trying to
climb up onto Hoffman's dock...

31:11.621 --> 31:14.255
Without her head.

31:14.257 --> 31:17.592
He's making this up.
Oh, no, it's true.

31:17.594 --> 31:21.129
Okay, I think I'm gonna
get going.

31:21.131 --> 31:23.798
You leaving?
Yeah.

31:28.637 --> 31:30.771
This is just so hard.

31:35.277 --> 31:39.247
She's your mom,
but she's our little girl.

31:39.249 --> 31:41.649
Oh, Ronnie, don't be...

31:44.419 --> 31:47.922
You just never know what's
gonna happen in this life.

32:41.743 --> 32:44.212
Are you mad I'm stopping?

32:46.982 --> 32:49.617
No.

32:49.619 --> 32:53.955
Nothing's shrinking them.

32:53.957 --> 32:58.859
I'd rather have a good few
months or a year... 50 years.

33:05.734 --> 33:07.835
Are you scared?

33:09.338 --> 33:12.673
No... not scared.

33:14.443 --> 33:18.346
I'm sorry for all the mean
things I said when you came out.

33:18.348 --> 33:21.549
That's... that's okay.

33:23.518 --> 33:26.254
No, I'm your mother.

33:26.256 --> 33:29.724
I want to ask your forgiveness
for that whole time.

33:32.661 --> 33:34.662
I forgive you.

33:36.932 --> 33:39.634
And when you were little,
I dropped you...

33:39.636 --> 33:41.869
And you hit your head
on the edge of a table.

33:41.871 --> 33:45.873
I think you're fine, but I'm
really sorry that I did that.

33:47.609 --> 33:49.877
It was very bad.

33:56.685 --> 34:02.690
My wish for you is to not be so
stressed. It's not worth it.

34:02.692 --> 34:04.825
You can be stress, stress,
stress...

34:04.827 --> 34:07.328
And still end up like this.

34:14.536 --> 34:16.637
That's a really good photo
of me.

34:16.639 --> 34:18.706
Yeah, it's pretty.

34:18.708 --> 34:22.443
Your mother was a model, David,
just so you know.

34:26.581 --> 34:29.717
Oh well.

34:33.822 --> 34:36.023
I wish we could just like...

34:36.025 --> 34:39.393
Go travel the whole world
real quick...

34:39.395 --> 34:43.563
So you could just see
everything.

34:43.565 --> 34:47.034
I get to see my whole world
at dinner tonight.

34:57.079 --> 34:59.680
All I ever wanted was
to be a mother,

34:59.682 --> 35:01.849
that's all I ever wanted.

35:01.851 --> 35:05.453
And I got to do that three
times...

35:05.455 --> 35:10.091
So whatever happens, happens.

35:10.093 --> 35:13.627
But I am coming to New York next
month to see you perform!

35:13.629 --> 35:18.132
Mm-hm, you can cross that one
off the board.

35:22.537 --> 35:24.638
I'll cross it out.

35:26.942 --> 35:30.711
But I don't know if I'll be here
for their things, though.

35:30.713 --> 35:32.947
I think you will.

35:40.422 --> 35:42.156
Are you gonna have kids?

35:46.828 --> 35:49.764
I want to.

35:49.766 --> 35:53.100
I love Paul, he's such
a nice guy.

35:53.102 --> 35:54.568
Yeah.

35:54.570 --> 35:56.971
You think you're gonna
marry him?

35:59.408 --> 36:01.842
Maybe, yeah.

36:01.844 --> 36:05.413
Yeah, I think you will.

36:14.022 --> 36:16.023
I farted.

36:16.025 --> 36:19.794
I'm so sorry.
That was disgusting.

36:19.796 --> 36:23.864
Wow, that smells so bad.
I'm kind of impressed.

36:23.866 --> 36:27.067
I'm sorry. Your mother
is disgusting.

36:27.069 --> 36:30.571
No... yes.

36:31.874 --> 36:34.542
All right, everyone, you ready?

36:34.544 --> 36:36.076
It's time for your next team.

36:36.078 --> 36:40.714
Put your hands together for,
"Mrs. Roboto!"

36:53.995 --> 36:57.865
Hi, guys! How y'all doin'?

36:59.801 --> 37:02.136
We are "Mrs. roboto"
and we are about to do...

37:02.138 --> 37:03.971
A fully improvised show for you.

37:03.973 --> 37:08.209
We just need a volunteer we can
interview about their hometown.

37:08.211 --> 37:10.177
So can I have a volunteer?

37:10.179 --> 37:14.748
Yeah, yes! Bright in the pink,
perfect, yeah.

37:14.750 --> 37:17.251
So, everybody clap for her.

37:17.253 --> 37:22.189
Oh, hello, so nice to meet you,
so nice to meet you, yes, yes.

37:22.191 --> 37:24.792
I can't do this, okay,
we actually know her.

37:24.794 --> 37:25.926
This is David's mom.

37:27.028 --> 37:29.997
So, I can't lie. I can't lie.

37:29.999 --> 37:32.066
I just can't lie to you.

37:32.068 --> 37:33.868
Have a seat.

37:33.870 --> 37:35.870
So, I just have some questions
I'm gonna ask you...

37:35.872 --> 37:38.839
About where you're from,
why don't you answer that?

37:38.841 --> 37:41.976
Um, I'm originally
from Austin, Minnesota.

37:41.978 --> 37:43.677
So what was it like
growing up there?

37:43.679 --> 37:46.013
What was like your family,
what'd you guys do?

37:46.015 --> 37:49.283
Um, well, we lived above a
restaurant called the old mill.

37:49.285 --> 37:50.818
The old mill?

37:50.820 --> 37:52.152
Because my father owned the
restaurant.

37:52.154 --> 37:53.254
Oh! Okay!

37:53.256 --> 37:55.589
So did you like work...

37:55.591 --> 37:57.224
Did you work there or eat
there or what'd you do?

37:57.226 --> 37:59.193
Well, no matter what I was
doing...

37:59.195 --> 38:00.794
Whether it was day or night...

38:00.796 --> 38:03.931
My father would call me and make
me come wash dishes.

38:03.933 --> 38:05.666
What?

38:05.668 --> 38:07.668
No matter what I was doing,
whether I was doing homework...

38:07.670 --> 38:12.106
Or on a date...
That's awful, right?

38:12.108 --> 38:14.575
Yeah, exactly.

38:14.577 --> 38:16.544
And I had a grandmother
named vi.

38:16.546 --> 38:18.679
Okay.
And this is a funny story.

38:18.681 --> 38:20.915
One Christmas, god as my
witness...

38:20.917 --> 38:24.552
All my brothers got boxes...

38:24.554 --> 38:27.721
With all her dead husbands'
old belts as presents.

38:27.723 --> 38:29.757
What?
Just all like...

38:29.759 --> 38:31.058
Like all messed up in a bag.

38:31.060 --> 38:34.194
Like a tangled up bag of belts?
Of belts.

38:34.196 --> 38:36.096
That is a truly horrible gift.
From her dead husband.

38:36.098 --> 38:37.898
Yes.
Wow, grandma.

38:37.900 --> 38:41.101
And then, that same year, she
gave me old bed sheets...

38:41.103 --> 38:45.005
That were ripped up into
sections for me to use as pads.

38:45.007 --> 38:49.643
What? That's an insane
thing to do.

38:49.645 --> 38:51.579
That's a weird thing.

38:51.581 --> 38:53.080
That was my grandmother vi.
Okay.

38:53.082 --> 38:55.950
Um, you're lovely.
Thank you.

38:55.952 --> 39:00.120
And I think we're good. Guys,
please give it up for Joanne!

39:01.856 --> 39:02.957
You can go have a seat.

39:10.865 --> 39:12.866
You know I love you.
Yeah, I love you, too.

39:12.868 --> 39:16.937
And I just feel like it's time
to take this to the next level.

39:16.939 --> 39:18.305
Oh, my god, I knew you were
going to do this.

39:18.307 --> 39:20.674
I knew you were going
to do this. I'm...

39:20.676 --> 39:22.109
Here you go.

39:22.111 --> 39:24.678
A lot of belts tangled up.
Yeah.

39:24.680 --> 39:29.917
This is incredible. Oh, my god.
You really love me.

39:29.919 --> 39:33.754
Girl, did he give you belts?
Yes!

39:33.756 --> 39:36.090
Damn!
It's so big!

39:36.092 --> 39:37.825
God, that means
he fucking loves you!

39:37.827 --> 39:40.361
I know!
Oh, my god!

39:40.363 --> 39:43.230
Don't untangle them!
Oh, I'm sorry.

39:43.232 --> 39:45.766
Push! Okay, he's coming, he's
coming.

39:45.768 --> 39:48.268
And there you go!

39:48.270 --> 39:50.070
That's great, the breathing
and everything...

39:50.072 --> 39:52.873
But if you could try and do some
dishes while...

39:52.875 --> 39:57.244
Here, let's have the baby do
some dishes, too.

39:57.246 --> 40:01.782
Agh! Cut the cord! Cut the cord!

40:04.953 --> 40:07.087
It's crazy, though!

40:07.089 --> 40:08.956
Wait, I have an even better one.

40:08.958 --> 40:11.392
So, some of you might know,
I'm a second-grade teacher.

40:11.394 --> 40:13.060
I don't know if David told you.

40:13.062 --> 40:14.962
So we're on the floor, doing
show-and-tell...

40:14.964 --> 40:16.163
Like we do every day.

40:16.165 --> 40:18.165
Show and tell!

40:18.167 --> 40:20.234
And yeah, you remember the days.

40:20.236 --> 40:22.770
And we get to my little student
Roberto...

40:22.772 --> 40:24.171
Who David knows I talk about
this cute...

40:24.173 --> 40:25.939
Little boy all the time.

40:25.941 --> 40:27.408
He's just like about the cutest
little boy in the world...

40:27.410 --> 40:29.343
A head full of silver teeth.

40:29.345 --> 40:31.245
So he says to me...

40:31.247 --> 40:34.181
"Mrs. Mulcahey, my show n tell's
still in my backpack".

40:34.183 --> 40:36.083
And I said, "that's okay, honey,
go get it out."

40:36.085 --> 40:38.852
He pulls out a fully dead
chicken...

40:38.854 --> 40:41.021
With the feathers still on it.

40:45.694 --> 40:49.797
You guys, your mom is so pretty.
She's like gorgeous!

40:49.799 --> 40:51.198
You both have her eyes.

40:51.200 --> 40:53.333
Yeah, she looks great!
Is she still...?

40:53.335 --> 40:56.770
Yeah, yeah, she's still...

40:56.772 --> 40:58.706
Okay, yeah, no, I was,
like when I saw her...

40:58.708 --> 41:00.774
I was like, "oh, I guess
she's better."

41:00.776 --> 41:04.078
And I was confused, because I
remember you said that um...

41:04.080 --> 41:09.249
Yeah, no, I mean she's off
chemo.

41:09.251 --> 41:15.789
So, the chemo was makes you
sick, so she's...

41:15.791 --> 41:17.091
All right...

41:17.093 --> 41:18.425
Feeling better.

41:18.427 --> 41:22.796
Well, how long will she be
off the chemo?

41:22.798 --> 41:27.334
Um, she's not doing it anymore.

41:32.073 --> 41:36.110
Well, can they try, like,
radiation or...?

41:36.112 --> 41:41.482
Yeah, we've already been
through all that, and...

41:41.484 --> 41:47.054
It's a weird form of cancer,
it doesn't really respond...

41:47.056 --> 41:51.291
It's basically just too far
spread, it's okay.

41:56.831 --> 41:58.899
David Mulcahey!

41:58.901 --> 42:00.868
Hi...

42:00.870 --> 42:04.071
Oh my god! I saw you at the
show, I was like, "it's David!"

42:04.073 --> 42:06.153
Cuz the other day I was like,
"where has David been?"

42:06.374 --> 42:08.475
You hate me, don't you?

42:08.477 --> 42:09.943
Yeah, I've been hiding.

42:09.945 --> 42:11.812
I knew it! You do, you hate me.
No, no.

42:11.814 --> 42:13.847
He hates me.

42:13.849 --> 42:17.184
It's okay, I'm not really mad,
I have been gone, too, so...

42:17.186 --> 42:20.420
My cousin had a wedding in
Philly, so I was gone for that.

42:20.422 --> 42:23.056
Then I broke my ankle...
Oh, no.

42:23.058 --> 42:25.125
And that was a whole thing,
and then I had another wedding.

42:25.127 --> 42:28.128
And then I like just didn't let
my ankle heal properly.

42:28.130 --> 42:30.330
So now you know my
crazy friends.

42:30.332 --> 42:32.366
- Yeah.
- That was really fun.

42:32.368 --> 42:34.001
I feel kind of tipsy.

42:34.003 --> 42:36.937
Is this it?
This is it.

42:36.939 --> 42:38.539
I like the gray brick.

42:38.541 --> 42:40.507
The neighborhood is actually
really nice...

42:40.509 --> 42:43.143
If you just walk like
six blocks that way.

42:43.145 --> 42:46.880
There's a good pizza place.

42:46.882 --> 42:49.416
I apologize in advance
for the 9,000 stairs...

42:49.418 --> 42:52.853
You're about to climb, but, uh...

42:52.855 --> 42:54.087
Are you gonna come up?

42:54.089 --> 42:55.222
I c...

42:57.992 --> 43:00.861
Really?
Please don't.

43:00.863 --> 43:05.165
Okay, come on, let's go!
Should we go up?

43:05.167 --> 43:07.034
Let's go.

43:08.236 --> 43:10.237
Ooh, I like the band-aid
on the floor...

43:10.239 --> 43:12.840
It matches the walls.

43:19.480 --> 43:21.348
Hey!
Hi, Paul!

43:21.350 --> 43:23.584
Hi!
It's so nice to see you.

43:23.586 --> 43:25.052
You, too.

43:25.054 --> 43:28.455
Hi. I like the shirt.
Oh, thank you.

43:28.457 --> 43:30.891
Looking good.
Hi! How you doing?

43:30.893 --> 43:32.326
Good, how are you?

43:34.028 --> 43:36.063
Thanks for doing this.

43:36.065 --> 43:38.131
Of course.

43:38.133 --> 43:42.903
So, here is our living room,
slash, family room, slash...

43:42.905 --> 43:44.371
Dining room, slash, kitchen.

43:44.373 --> 43:46.406
And you've seen our gorgeous
foyer.

43:46.408 --> 43:48.942
You don't need anything
more than this!

43:48.944 --> 43:51.111
You've got everything here.

43:51.113 --> 43:53.213
Nice sexy, shiny bedspread.

43:53.215 --> 43:56.250
Oh, sexy, shiny...
Thanks, Alex.

43:56.252 --> 43:57.985
It's pretty sexy.

43:57.987 --> 44:00.454
Hey, I'm sorry that
I wasn't at the show.

44:00.456 --> 44:02.956
This server who's a liar
called in sick.

44:02.958 --> 44:04.157
Oh, it's okay.

44:04.159 --> 44:06.326
It was a great show.
It was so funny.

44:06.328 --> 44:09.263
You've gotta tell Paul
the... news.

44:09.265 --> 44:11.198
What?

44:11.200 --> 44:15.502
Yeah, I saw the artistic
director after...

44:15.504 --> 44:18.372
And he mentioned this ABC show
that's staffing...

44:18.374 --> 44:20.274
And he knows the show-runner.

44:20.276 --> 44:23.076
So I'm gonna send in a spec.

44:23.078 --> 44:25.946
That's great! You already have
that one you can send.

44:25.948 --> 44:30.284
I mean, it needs a lot of work,
but...

44:30.286 --> 44:33.220
Where's your dad?

44:33.222 --> 44:36.423
He's standing downstairs.

44:39.227 --> 44:40.994
Do you have any wine?

44:40.996 --> 44:42.529
Uh, yeah, yeah, we do.

44:42.531 --> 44:45.365
Isn't he waiting?

44:45.367 --> 44:48.268
He is waiting!
Do you have any wine?

44:48.270 --> 44:50.003
I'm just in the mood
for a glass of wine.

44:53.442 --> 44:57.010
Thanks for cleaning.
Yeah, no problem.

44:57.012 --> 45:02.082
Your sisters are starting to
look <i> so</i> much like your mom.

45:02.084 --> 45:04.651
Really?
Yeah, like identical.

45:11.526 --> 45:16.663
Our lease is up on the 30th.

45:16.665 --> 45:18.665
Yeah, I know.

45:18.667 --> 45:21.368
Yeah, so, I'm gonna resign it,
but you don't need to worry...

45:21.370 --> 45:23.337
About it. You can leave
your stuff here.

45:23.339 --> 45:26.673
Can we talk about that not now?

45:26.675 --> 45:29.443
Please?
Okay.

45:44.192 --> 45:47.094
Do you want me to...
No, no, I...

45:53.034 --> 45:56.470
I finished like three days ago.
I know, shut up, shut up.

45:58.639 --> 46:00.374
Let's just start over.

46:05.179 --> 46:07.547
David, you're kinda...
I know, I...

46:07.549 --> 46:10.584
Okay, but you're making
a murder face.

46:29.737 --> 46:31.371
Oh, fuck...

46:31.373 --> 46:34.207
I'm sorry, that sucked.

46:38.047 --> 46:40.580
I think that's the best
we've ever had.

46:40.582 --> 46:48.321
It was kind of tantric.

46:51.593 --> 46:54.161
Did you wax your butthole?

46:54.163 --> 46:55.695
Haha, what?

46:55.697 --> 46:58.098
You did!

46:58.100 --> 47:01.234
You wa... who are you?

47:01.236 --> 47:06.206
I was just trying it!
You know I hate hair.

47:06.208 --> 47:10.143
So are you, like,
having sex, then?

47:10.145 --> 47:12.179
Why can't I just wax it for me?

47:12.181 --> 47:16.183
Well, you can, but that seems
like a stupid thing to do.

47:16.185 --> 47:20.454
It's fine, if you've had sex.
That's fine.

47:20.456 --> 47:23.790
I know it's fine.

47:23.792 --> 47:26.560
So you have?

47:26.562 --> 47:28.862
No.

47:28.864 --> 47:32.232
You paused, so, you have.

47:32.234 --> 47:34.434
You're creating one
of your fights.

47:34.436 --> 47:36.770
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.

47:36.772 --> 47:40.841
Also, having sex with
other people would be healthy.

47:40.843 --> 47:45.545
You should try it. Or at least,
you know, date, flirt. Whatever.

47:45.547 --> 47:48.515
Yeah, right. That's me.

47:48.517 --> 47:53.420
Okay, fine, you just sit
inside your head all day.

48:00.728 --> 48:07.567
Okay, so, I haven't had sex...

48:07.569 --> 48:13.406
But I did masturbate like nine
times in one day last week.

48:13.408 --> 48:15.175
Wow, nine?

48:15.177 --> 48:19.880
Yeah, ten years later, I'm back
on that same twin bed...

48:19.882 --> 48:23.350
Just goin' at it like old times.

48:23.352 --> 48:24.851
You sound wistful.

48:24.853 --> 48:28.388
It was kind of nice, yeah.

48:28.390 --> 48:34.528
I got this huge mahogany desk
when I was little.

48:34.530 --> 48:36.229
It's still in there...

48:36.231 --> 48:39.266
And I remember asking
specifically for it...

48:39.268 --> 48:40.800
For my 8th birthday.

48:40.802 --> 48:42.802
Yeah, and of course you asked
for a mahogany desk...

48:42.804 --> 48:44.838
For your 8th birthday.

48:44.840 --> 48:48.341
And one of the drawers has
a lock and key...

48:48.343 --> 48:53.246
So it made sense for me to keep
all of my porn in there.

48:53.248 --> 48:56.883
But it wasn't porn, it was like
the ads from the Sunday paper.

48:56.885 --> 49:00.220
So there would be like this
guy standing there...

49:00.222 --> 49:04.724
In a JC Penney swim suit from
the late 90's...

49:04.726 --> 49:07.794
Just working it and...
Working it?

49:07.796 --> 49:10.397
And um, I would steal it...
Uh-huh.

49:10.399 --> 49:13.200
And masturbate to the same
JC Penney man for like months.

49:13.202 --> 49:16.469
Can you imagine masturbating
to something like that now?

49:16.471 --> 49:20.273
No, I need like full fucking
and novelty.

49:20.275 --> 49:22.876
Right. The worst part...
Mm-hm.

49:24.512 --> 49:27.581
Oh, my god.

49:27.583 --> 49:30.283
Was that when I went
to college...

49:30.285 --> 49:36.990
I was so worried that my parents
would find these photos that...

49:36.992 --> 49:40.727
Instead of just throwing them
away like a normal person...

49:40.729 --> 49:45.498
I would cut each of the photos
into tiny, little strips...

49:45.500 --> 49:48.001
And then I would soak
them in water.

49:48.003 --> 49:49.903
What?

49:49.905 --> 49:55.275
And then I divvied the soggy bits
up into different trash bags...

49:55.277 --> 49:58.411
And then threw them away into
different garbage cans...

49:58.413 --> 49:59.779
Wait, in case...
Of my neighbors'...

49:59.781 --> 50:01.481
Just on the street.
Like you were worried...

50:01.483 --> 50:03.316
Someone was gonna piece them
back together?

50:03.318 --> 50:04.985
I know.

50:04.987 --> 50:07.654
You think like Sherlock Holmes
was trying to out you?

50:07.656 --> 50:10.290
I don't know.
Going through the trash?

50:10.292 --> 50:11.658
I don't know.

50:14.562 --> 50:16.029
I was an insane person.

50:16.031 --> 50:19.899
Oh, poor, tiny, terrified,
little David.

50:23.504 --> 50:27.707
That's truly horrible.
Hey...

50:27.709 --> 50:31.378
I'm sorry I was an asshole
about your butthole.

50:31.380 --> 50:33.713
It's okay.

50:33.715 --> 50:37.384
I got it done at this place
called wax poetic.

50:37.386 --> 50:39.452
No, you didn't.
Yeah, I did.

50:39.454 --> 50:42.555
But the guy who did it,
didn't say a single word.

50:42.557 --> 50:45.959
He just like basically grunted.

50:45.961 --> 50:49.963
Did it hurt?
Yeah, it hurt... so bad.

50:53.934 --> 50:56.436
Do you want me to spoon you?

50:56.438 --> 50:57.771
You don't have to.

50:57.773 --> 51:01.741
I know, but I want to.
I want to.

51:05.379 --> 51:08.348
Just pretend I'm the guy
from the JC Penney ad.

51:08.350 --> 51:10.684
Oh, in your dreams.

51:10.686 --> 51:13.920
I got sand on my feet in a
moderately-priced...

51:13.922 --> 51:16.790
Modest swim trunk.

51:23.932 --> 51:27.000
It's such a beautiful day.
Mm-hm.

51:27.002 --> 51:28.935
I might run a little bit.
Okay.

51:28.937 --> 51:30.603
You want to run with me,
just kinda...?

51:30.605 --> 51:31.971
Yeah.

51:31.973 --> 51:34.474
Yeah, I just want to get my
heart rate up.

51:34.476 --> 51:36.643
Okay.
I wanna run.

51:52.593 --> 51:54.527
Hey.

51:54.529 --> 51:56.396
Beccah's at work. I was gonna
go for a walk.

51:56.398 --> 51:57.931
Would you wanna come?

51:57.933 --> 52:00.667
Oh, I'm okay. Thanks, though.

52:00.669 --> 52:03.570
I'm gonna... I gotta finish this.
Okay.

52:32.099 --> 52:33.700
Fuck it.

53:32.460 --> 53:34.961
Do you have any idea
what we're about to witness?

53:34.963 --> 53:38.131
I don't know, per Se, but what I
do know is that it is called...

53:38.133 --> 53:40.967
"An evening of movement
and dance for my father...

53:40.969 --> 53:43.636
"Rod Stewart,
on his 60th birthday."

53:43.638 --> 53:47.674
And you'll notice right when you
open it up there's a rose petal.

53:47.676 --> 53:50.677
Which is v-tasteful,
I'm very proud.

53:50.679 --> 53:54.514
I never realized your dad's
name is actually rod Stewart.

53:54.516 --> 53:57.050
Yeah, it's been very hard
for him.

53:57.052 --> 54:01.120
Hi, everybody. Hey, hello,
hello.

54:01.122 --> 54:04.991
Well, first of all, thank you
for coming to my birthday.

54:04.993 --> 54:06.493
And I just got the word
from Justin...

54:06.495 --> 54:07.727
That he's ready to come down,
so...

54:07.729 --> 54:09.629
No, I...

54:09.631 --> 54:12.232
Sorry, ignore that. We don't
know where he's gonna come from.

54:12.234 --> 54:15.602
Oh, and he wanted me to say,
please make sure all your...

54:15.604 --> 54:20.540
Phones are completely on and
that the flash is also on.

54:20.542 --> 54:23.576
All right, uh, I'm supposed
to hit play, hold on.

54:25.579 --> 54:26.713
<i>Justin ladies and gentlemen...</i>

54:26.715 --> 54:28.081
<i>A quick note before the show.</i>

54:28.083 --> 54:30.583
<i>I, Justin, could not be
with you tonight.</i>

54:30.585 --> 54:32.886
<i>So instead, sit back, relax...</i>

54:32.888 --> 54:37.757
<i>And enjoy dancing from my best
friend... Justina Carrera.</i>

55:43.258 --> 55:44.824
Oh my god.

56:00.241 --> 56:02.075
Yes, yes, yes.

56:08.950 --> 56:11.184
Can we be arrested for this?

56:11.186 --> 56:15.021
I feel like we all can and
should go to jail.

56:15.023 --> 56:17.390
Okay, you're just jealous,
because this kid's 1000 times...

56:17.392 --> 56:19.058
More confident than
you'll ever be.

56:27.769 --> 56:31.871
Oh, my god! Ah!

56:34.208 --> 56:36.309
Stunning!

56:36.311 --> 56:39.412
That was so stressful.

56:39.414 --> 56:42.148
I mean, that was the best thing
I've ever seen...

56:42.150 --> 56:44.017
In my entire life.

56:49.423 --> 56:51.324
Did I tell you that me
and my family...

56:51.326 --> 56:54.694
Went to New York last month?
No.

56:54.696 --> 56:58.097
And I took them by to
see me and Paul's apartment.

56:58.099 --> 57:00.400
And my dad wouldn't come up.
No!

57:00.402 --> 57:03.936
Yes, and we were having such
a nice time, before that.

57:03.938 --> 57:06.205
Do the... have you told them that
you're not together any more?

57:06.207 --> 57:08.941
No, I haven't told them.
Oh, god, David.

57:08.943 --> 57:12.779
It's just...

57:12.781 --> 57:16.749
I just want my mom to die
thinking I'm doing okay.

57:16.751 --> 57:18.985
That's all.

57:33.033 --> 57:35.768
Do you ever cry about your mom?

57:35.770 --> 57:37.904
Now?
Mm-hm.

57:40.774 --> 57:44.711
No. You know, I mean,
I get sad...

57:44.713 --> 57:48.948
And you know, it comes in waves.

57:48.950 --> 57:54.353
But I haven't like cried,
cried, in like, awhile?

57:57.291 --> 57:59.926
We haven't been in church in
like three months.

57:59.928 --> 58:03.162
Your family? That's huge.
Mm-hm.

58:03.164 --> 58:06.766
I thought this was the time
where I'm was supposed to get...

58:06.768 --> 58:08.234
All "religious-y".

58:08.236 --> 58:11.137
And I keep waiting for that
beautiful moment...

58:11.139 --> 58:13.106
Of revelation about life.

58:13.108 --> 58:16.109
I mean, I thought when your mom
dies, you get like a moment...

58:16.111 --> 58:19.045
Where you're both like sitting
on a park bench...

58:19.047 --> 58:24.951
On a beautiful day, and then,
all of a sudden...

58:24.953 --> 58:30.123
You hear the voice of god and
just everything becomes clear.

58:31.492 --> 58:37.063
I want that...
I want that moment.

58:39.967 --> 58:41.200
I...

58:44.805 --> 58:49.242
I weirdly had like,
that moment, sort of.

58:49.244 --> 58:51.177
Yeah?
Yeah.

58:51.179 --> 58:53.179
I remember when my mom died,
everyone at church was like...

58:53.181 --> 58:55.214
Like, you know, uh you know...

58:55.216 --> 58:58.084
"At least she'll be looking down
on you, you know, from heaven."

58:58.086 --> 59:01.487
Which is... I mean, it is the
worst thing that you can hear.

59:01.489 --> 59:03.222
Yes.

59:03.224 --> 59:05.858
But the one meaningful thing
anyone said to me...

59:05.860 --> 59:09.228
In that entire time,
was from my mom.

59:09.230 --> 59:11.798
We were outside...
Good start.

59:11.800 --> 59:16.269
Um, just a warning, this is
gonna get very gay.

59:16.271 --> 59:18.337
Okay.

59:18.339 --> 59:22.341
We were in our backyard, and...

59:22.343 --> 59:28.147
I remember her saying something about how much she
loved birch trees, you know, which I already knew.

59:28.149 --> 59:32.518
But then she said, "when I die,
I'm gonna be a birch tree.

59:32.520 --> 59:34.921
"So when you see one,
that's me."

59:34.923 --> 59:37.857
And, you know, I fully
should've forgotten it...

59:37.859 --> 59:40.893
'Cause it's such a small, random
thing and people say bullshit...

59:40.895 --> 59:43.062
Like that all the time, but it
has always stuck with me...

59:43.064 --> 59:46.232
Because you know, now I
literally always think of her...

59:46.234 --> 59:49.569
When I see a birch tree,
and it is so nice.

59:49.571 --> 59:50.970
Yeah.

59:50.972 --> 59:52.872
You know, and I do not
believe...

59:52.874 --> 59:54.974
In the "she's looking down
on you" thing, at all.

59:54.976 --> 59:57.577
But, you know, she said she was
a birch tree.

59:57.579 --> 59:59.512
And I know she's not
really one...

59:59.514 --> 01:00:03.583
But... I don't know,
she sort of is.

01:00:03.585 --> 01:00:05.305
'Cause now every time
I see one, I'm like...

01:00:06.353 --> 01:00:09.322
"There's mom".

01:00:09.324 --> 01:00:12.458
So I didn't learn some huge
lesson...

01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:17.997
But that was my Jesus-y moment,
you know, sans Christ.

01:00:17.999 --> 01:00:20.399
And I will always have it.

01:00:20.401 --> 01:00:22.501
That's really nice.

01:00:33.348 --> 01:00:37.016
Don't look at us,
we're drug addicts!

01:00:37.018 --> 01:00:38.918
Hello.

01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:40.152
David, don't.

01:00:40.154 --> 01:00:42.088
What's going on?

01:00:42.090 --> 01:00:44.957
We're drug addicts, David,
it's time that you knew.

01:00:44.959 --> 01:00:48.895
Okay. Is dad okay?

01:00:48.897 --> 01:00:53.432
Dad has to give his report
on the school tomorrow...

01:00:53.434 --> 01:00:55.368
He has to go into the...

01:00:58.238 --> 01:01:00.206
He has to go to the district
office...

01:01:00.208 --> 01:01:02.341
And give this school report.

01:01:02.343 --> 01:01:04.410
You know what your speech should
just be, Norman?

01:01:04.412 --> 01:01:06.946
You should go in...

01:01:08.382 --> 01:01:11.050
"Attention, here's my progress
report...

01:01:11.052 --> 01:01:14.320
"My wife is dying and we smoked
too much pot...

01:01:14.322 --> 01:01:16.389
"And they had to take us
to the emergency room...

01:01:16.391 --> 01:01:19.959
"Because my wife ate too
many potato chips."

01:01:19.961 --> 01:01:21.460
Wait, you went to the
emergency room?

01:01:21.462 --> 01:01:22.628
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.

01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:24.664
What'd they say?

01:01:24.666 --> 01:01:27.300
They said you took too much pot
and you gotta go home.

01:01:27.302 --> 01:01:30.670
They said you took too much pot,
get your ass out of here.

01:01:30.672 --> 01:01:32.505
Very... high.

01:01:32.507 --> 01:01:35.308
They said, get your...

01:01:37.244 --> 01:01:38.511
That's what they said.

01:01:38.513 --> 01:01:41.113
They said, hey...

01:01:43.350 --> 01:01:46.519
I thought you didn't wanna try
medical marijuana.

01:01:46.521 --> 01:01:49.622
Well, I tried it!

01:01:49.624 --> 01:01:53.526
I see that. But why are you
so stoned?

01:01:53.528 --> 01:01:55.361
How much butter did you use?

01:01:55.363 --> 01:01:56.963
Just one stick!

01:01:56.965 --> 01:01:59.432
You used a whole stick?
Mm-hm.

01:01:59.434 --> 01:02:01.133
Wait, how do you know
how much goes in there?

01:02:01.135 --> 01:02:05.004
Because I smoke pot.
I'm stoned right now.

01:02:06.707 --> 01:02:08.407
Drink some water.

01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:13.312
Good for you, David.
Live your life.

01:02:13.314 --> 01:02:14.447
I will.

01:02:14.449 --> 01:02:17.383
Live your life, you too, Norman.

01:02:17.385 --> 01:02:19.218
When I die, you gotta live
your life.

01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:21.253
Except you can't date
anyone for a year...

01:02:21.255 --> 01:02:24.123
And you can't date that slut
who came to the door today.

01:02:24.125 --> 01:02:26.525
As in Lisa, the one that
brought you a pie?

01:02:26.527 --> 01:02:29.295
Eh, only a slut would come to
the door with dessert.

01:02:29.297 --> 01:02:31.497
You're supposed to bring a
lasagna or something like that.

01:02:31.499 --> 01:02:33.299
I didn't know that.

01:02:33.301 --> 01:02:37.503
Well, I'm gonna go find Alex
and Beccah... have fun.

01:02:38.672 --> 01:02:41.273
Come in!

01:02:41.275 --> 01:02:42.441
Hi.

01:02:42.443 --> 01:02:43.676
Did you see mom?

01:02:43.678 --> 01:02:45.578
Yes. What happened?

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:47.346
I came home from work and
they were like that.

01:02:47.348 --> 01:02:49.215
It's your fault.

01:02:49.217 --> 01:02:50.750
I didn't wanna tell them they
were putting too much butter...

01:02:50.752 --> 01:02:53.185
Because then they were gonna
ask how I know.

01:02:53.187 --> 01:02:54.720
Ask how you know?
Alex, look at your shirt!

01:02:54.722 --> 01:02:56.489
They know you do drugs.

01:02:56.491 --> 01:02:58.324
Look at your shirt!
They didn't know you were gay!

01:02:58.326 --> 01:03:00.159
This is just blue.

01:03:00.161 --> 01:03:03.295
It was like my favorite night
with them like, ever.

01:03:03.297 --> 01:03:04.497
That's nice.

01:03:04.499 --> 01:03:06.332
You shoulda been there.

01:03:06.334 --> 01:03:09.368
They're like pot jolly ranchers
if you wanna do em sometime.

01:03:09.370 --> 01:03:11.504
Yeah... maybe.

01:03:11.506 --> 01:03:15.608
Does that mean no?
No, it means maybe.

01:03:15.610 --> 01:03:17.676
Well, I'm gonna put mom
to bed now.

01:03:17.678 --> 01:03:20.046
And then maybe do you
wanna hang out?

01:03:20.048 --> 01:03:21.814
Oh, that's okay.

01:03:21.816 --> 01:03:24.383
Thanks, but I'm gonna try and do
some writing while she's asleep.

01:03:24.385 --> 01:03:26.719
Always writing.

01:03:46.239 --> 01:03:49.775
I'm glad we're doing this.
Yeah.

01:03:49.777 --> 01:03:52.845
Yeah, the school looks pretty.

01:03:55.849 --> 01:03:58.818
I like the birch trees.

01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:02.288
You like birch trees, right?

01:04:02.290 --> 01:04:03.290
Mm-hm.

01:04:08.361 --> 01:04:10.396
Okay, ladies, ladies, ladies...

01:04:10.398 --> 01:04:13.732
Ladies and gentleman...
Thank you.

01:04:13.734 --> 01:04:16.102
To the start of another
good year!

01:04:16.104 --> 01:04:17.803
And for having Joanne
with us today!

01:04:17.805 --> 01:04:19.605
Cheers!
To Joanne!

01:04:21.141 --> 01:04:22.641
Joanne, do not judge my room.

01:04:22.643 --> 01:04:25.111
I know that it is
a disaster zone.

01:04:25.113 --> 01:04:26.579
Your mother always had her
room set up...

01:04:26.581 --> 01:04:29.181
Weeks before the
school year started.

01:04:29.183 --> 01:04:31.183
We hated her.

01:04:31.185 --> 01:04:33.752
I guess I have a tough act
to follow then, huh?

01:04:33.754 --> 01:04:35.754
Well, if you teach with us,
all that matters is...

01:04:35.756 --> 01:04:37.156
Do you like wine?

01:04:37.158 --> 01:04:39.758
Exactly.
Oh, my god, yes!

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:43.529
Joanne, she's gonna take over
for you just fine.

01:04:43.531 --> 01:04:45.631
Joanne, I really like this top.

01:04:45.633 --> 01:04:47.666
Target.
Where?

01:04:47.668 --> 01:04:49.568
Target.
Target.

01:04:49.570 --> 01:04:50.903
You always have the cutest
stuff.

01:04:50.905 --> 01:04:52.404
You really do.

01:04:52.406 --> 01:04:54.673
And target has really
good stuff.

01:04:54.675 --> 01:04:56.809
They really do! I love it there.

01:04:56.811 --> 01:04:59.578
Vicki, Vicki?

01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:03.215
Vicki, you're getting Roberto's
little brother this year.

01:05:03.217 --> 01:05:05.184
Oh, good luck.

01:05:05.186 --> 01:05:06.785
I'm sorry, who am I...
Who am I getting?

01:05:06.787 --> 01:05:08.921
Roberto's little brother
this year.

01:05:08.923 --> 01:05:10.856
Roberto's brother, the one
with the silver teeth.

01:05:10.858 --> 01:05:15.761
Mm-hm.
Uh-huh.

01:05:15.763 --> 01:05:21.400
Roberto. I had him two years
ago. He brought the chicken.

01:05:23.870 --> 01:05:28.174
His little brother is in our
clas... your class, this year.

01:05:28.176 --> 01:05:31.744
See, that's why Joanne's
retiring.

01:05:33.213 --> 01:05:34.446
I see.

01:05:34.448 --> 01:05:36.448
I like Roberto.

01:05:36.450 --> 01:05:39.351
We can leave whenever
you want, okay?

01:05:39.353 --> 01:05:40.719
And now what was the
chicken story, though?

01:05:40.721 --> 01:05:42.354
I missed that.

01:05:42.356 --> 01:05:44.423
Joanne, you gotta tell her.
Yeah, tell her.

01:05:46.793 --> 01:05:53.299
We were doing show n tell, and
he pulled out his backpack...

01:05:53.301 --> 01:05:54.366
His what?

01:05:54.368 --> 01:05:57.236
His backpack.

01:05:57.238 --> 01:06:03.709
He says, "Mrs. Mulcahey,
I brought this chicken"...

01:06:03.711 --> 01:06:04.944
Eww.

01:06:04.946 --> 01:06:09.248
I'm sorry, what was going on?

01:06:09.250 --> 01:06:10.816
It was show n tell.

01:06:10.818 --> 01:06:14.353
Oh, I didn't... I missed that
part! Ah, go on.

01:06:14.355 --> 01:06:16.689
You tell the story. You can
tell...

01:06:16.691 --> 01:06:19.425
No, go on, please, go on.

01:06:19.427 --> 01:06:21.527
Okay, so... I mean, Joanne
tells it better, but...

01:06:21.529 --> 01:06:23.229
So he pulls out this backpack...

01:06:23.231 --> 01:06:27.266
And inside is a like legit,
full-on dead chicken.

01:06:27.268 --> 01:06:32.871
Not from a store, with feathers
on it, newly dead.

01:06:32.873 --> 01:06:35.374
Oh, no!

01:06:35.376 --> 01:06:38.010
We laughed so hard I thought
I was gonna pee my pants.

01:06:38.012 --> 01:06:39.878
Joanne did.

01:06:46.886 --> 01:06:48.754
My mom wanted me to give you
these.

01:06:48.756 --> 01:06:51.557
They're little boxes that she
made for the kids...

01:06:51.559 --> 01:06:54.260
With their names on 'em and all
their pencils...

01:06:54.262 --> 01:06:55.761
And little candies and stuff.

01:06:55.763 --> 01:06:59.365
Oh my god. Joanne!

01:06:59.367 --> 01:07:02.434
This is too much.
You did not have to do this.

01:07:02.436 --> 01:07:04.303
One less thing for you
to have to do.

01:07:04.305 --> 01:07:06.872
And I put a candy in each one...

01:07:06.874 --> 01:07:09.041
But you can take it out,
if you want to.

01:07:09.043 --> 01:07:11.043
Thank you so much.

01:07:11.045 --> 01:07:14.680
Your mother is the best. She's
just the be St.

01:07:14.682 --> 01:07:20.853
All right, okay, um,
well, come visit!

01:07:20.855 --> 01:07:23.989
You know, stop by any time,
it's your classroom.

01:07:23.991 --> 01:07:27.793
I'm just babysitting, so...

01:07:27.795 --> 01:07:29.295
Okay.

01:07:32.932 --> 01:07:34.833
You okay?

01:07:42.876 --> 01:07:44.476
Okay.

01:07:59.392 --> 01:08:02.594
You're lucky, I was gonna
finish off your fries.

01:08:02.596 --> 01:08:03.996
I bet you can't get fries
that good...

01:08:03.998 --> 01:08:06.031
In any fancy New York diner.

01:08:06.033 --> 01:08:09.335
Nope.

01:08:09.337 --> 01:08:10.969
So, Alex, have you decided
what you want to do...

01:08:10.971 --> 01:08:12.771
For your birthday?

01:08:12.773 --> 01:08:14.606
It's October.

01:08:14.608 --> 01:08:17.843
Yeah, but December 1st is gonna
be here before you know it.

01:08:25.085 --> 01:08:30.656
Does anybody have any questions
about what's going on with mom?

01:08:32.625 --> 01:08:36.462
This is... her body is shutting
down.

01:08:36.464 --> 01:08:39.732
That's... that's what
you're noticing.

01:08:46.673 --> 01:08:48.474
How's Daniel?

01:08:48.475 --> 01:08:50.442
Good.
Good.

01:08:50.444 --> 01:08:52.111
Working a lot.

01:08:52.113 --> 01:08:55.013
I'm so grateful that you've
had him through this.

01:08:55.015 --> 01:08:56.814
Yeah.

01:08:56.817 --> 01:08:58.149
How about you?
You dating anybody?

01:08:58.152 --> 01:09:00.419
When would I do that?

01:09:00.421 --> 01:09:02.921
Well, what about... what's his
name, Pete?

01:09:02.923 --> 01:09:04.923
From... the homecoming guy?

01:09:04.925 --> 01:09:06.792
Ew. He has little,
baby corn teeth.

01:09:06.794 --> 01:09:09.461
I loved his teeth.

01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:15.033
How about you, David?
How's the writing going?

01:09:19.139 --> 01:09:20.805
It's great.

01:09:20.808 --> 01:09:23.175
Yeah, did you turn in
the ABC script?

01:09:23.176 --> 01:09:24.542
Yeah.

01:09:25.612 --> 01:09:27.712
That's good!

01:09:27.715 --> 01:09:30.515
And how's Paul?

01:09:30.518 --> 01:09:34.620
He's good. Thanks for asking.

01:09:36.890 --> 01:09:39.925
Ooh, it's grandma.
I'll be right back.

01:09:42.429 --> 01:09:44.729
Hey Ruth-Anne...

01:09:44.732 --> 01:09:48.700
It's like, what the fuck?
He still can't ask about Paul?

01:09:48.702 --> 01:09:51.636
You've never asked about me
or Rebeccah.

01:09:51.639 --> 01:09:53.538
What, Alex? Yes, I have.

01:09:53.541 --> 01:09:58.577
Other people are sad, too.

01:09:58.579 --> 01:10:02.047
I know that.

01:10:02.049 --> 01:10:05.117
What ev...

01:11:13.119 --> 01:11:17.723
So, on a scale of one to,
like, a fucking million...

01:11:17.725 --> 01:11:20.826
How terrible is
everyone on ok cupid?

01:11:20.828 --> 01:11:22.127
What?

01:11:22.129 --> 01:11:24.596
Like a fucking trillion, right?

01:11:24.598 --> 01:11:26.532
Well, I mean, they're not
that bad. We're on it.

01:11:26.534 --> 01:11:28.767
Well, yeah, I mean we're great.
We're fantastic people.

01:11:28.769 --> 01:11:33.272
But like everyone else,
fucking lunatics, right?

01:11:34.874 --> 01:11:38.010
It might just be 'cause
it's Sacramento.

01:11:38.012 --> 01:11:40.012
I kind of like Sacramento.

01:11:40.014 --> 01:11:41.213
Really?

01:11:41.215 --> 01:11:42.681
Yeah.

01:11:42.683 --> 01:11:43.916
I'm like, kind of drunk,
I think.

01:11:43.918 --> 01:11:45.150
Really?
Yeah.

01:11:45.152 --> 01:11:49.254
You know, I'm feeling good.

01:11:49.256 --> 01:11:52.157
I'm not.

01:11:52.159 --> 01:11:55.127
I mean, I guess I just thought
that we were like eating.

01:11:55.129 --> 01:11:56.895
When I said 9:00...

01:11:56.897 --> 01:11:59.731
I just thought it was implied
it was just drinks only.

01:11:59.733 --> 01:12:03.201
You are just trying to make
me black out.

01:12:03.203 --> 01:12:06.171
What? No, I'm not, no.
Aren't you?

01:12:06.173 --> 01:12:07.606
I'm kidding.

01:12:07.608 --> 01:12:09.675
Right.

01:12:22.889 --> 01:12:24.723
So, we are we going?

01:12:24.725 --> 01:12:26.825
Um...
Next.

01:12:26.827 --> 01:12:28.994
We could go watch
a movie at my place.

01:12:28.996 --> 01:12:30.929
I got mirror, mirror at the
grocery store.

01:12:30.931 --> 01:12:33.098
Oh, my fucking god.

01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:34.232
That's just all they had.

01:12:34.234 --> 01:12:36.301
That's all they had?

01:12:38.271 --> 01:12:40.806
I'm gonna get a pen.
Okay.

01:12:55.688 --> 01:12:58.223
I really would love to watch
a movie with you...

01:12:58.225 --> 01:13:02.094
It's just, I have to be up
at like 6:00...

01:13:02.096 --> 01:13:03.695
To help my mom,
that's not a line.

01:13:03.697 --> 01:13:05.631
Your mom?
Yeah, she's sick.

01:13:05.633 --> 01:13:07.766
Oh.
No, it's fine.

01:13:07.768 --> 01:13:10.802
No, I'm sorry about that,
it's not fine.

01:13:10.804 --> 01:13:15.374
She just started hospice, so now
is most definitely not fine.

01:13:15.376 --> 01:13:19.044
But... it's fine.

01:13:22.048 --> 01:13:23.649
Okay, I think I need to go
to the bathroom.

01:13:23.651 --> 01:13:25.384
Okay.

01:13:25.386 --> 01:13:26.985
I'm really sorry, I feel like
I'm being the weird one...

01:13:26.987 --> 01:13:29.254
On this date, which I'm normally
the normal one.

01:13:29.256 --> 01:13:31.790
It's okay.
On dates.

01:13:31.792 --> 01:13:33.992
But I'll just be right back.

01:13:55.248 --> 01:13:56.848
Fuck.

01:14:31.718 --> 01:14:34.252
I'm back.
Hey.

01:14:34.254 --> 01:14:35.921
Are you okay?
Yeah.

01:14:35.923 --> 01:14:40.258
No, I just... I was just...

01:14:40.260 --> 01:14:44.296
I threw up on my face.

01:14:46.799 --> 01:14:48.133
<i>Norman hey, it's dad.</i>

01:14:48.135 --> 01:14:49.434
<i>You must be still at the gym.</i>

01:14:49.436 --> 01:14:51.203
<i>Maybe boxing or something.</i>

01:14:51.205 --> 01:14:54.239
<i>Anyway, would you mind picking
up some toilet paper...</i>

01:14:54.241 --> 01:14:55.974
<i>And some laxatives?</i>

01:14:55.976 --> 01:14:58.744
<i>Just make sure to get
the suppository kind.</i>

01:14:58.746 --> 01:15:00.879
<i>Okay? Thank</i> you!

01:15:00.881 --> 01:15:03.014
Fuck.

01:15:09.389 --> 01:15:11.957
<i>Announcer mm.
You're listening to the lineup.</i>

01:15:11.959 --> 01:15:14.426
<i>Urging you to love somebody
tonight.</i>

01:15:14.428 --> 01:15:18.163
<i>This next song is going out
to Alan in Iraq.</i>

01:15:18.165 --> 01:15:20.532
<i>Your fiance Trish loves you
very much...</i>

01:15:20.534 --> 01:15:24.169
<i>And thanks you for all that
you do for your country.</i>

01:15:24.171 --> 01:15:28.306
<i>Alan, here's "drops of Jupiter".</i>

01:15:28.308 --> 01:15:30.909
Oh my fucking fuck!

01:15:38.117 --> 01:15:39.951
Where is the medicine?

01:15:39.953 --> 01:15:42.053
Toothpaste.

01:15:42.055 --> 01:15:45.857
Medicine!

01:15:45.859 --> 01:15:50.295
Okay, where are the fucking
laxatives?

01:15:52.465 --> 01:15:56.368
What the fuck? Aisle 5,
medicine, health, wellness...

01:15:56.370 --> 01:15:59.404
I literally need something
that is all of these things.

01:16:02.041 --> 01:16:05.010
Where the fuck is it?

01:16:06.078 --> 01:16:08.413
Oh, my god, oh, my god.

01:16:08.415 --> 01:16:11.082
Bunch of fucking bouncy balls
in the medicine aisle...

01:16:11.084 --> 01:16:13.485
But there's no fucking medicine.

01:16:13.487 --> 01:16:17.189
Hello? Anyone? Am I
in a ghost store?

01:16:19.992 --> 01:16:24.296
Hi. I was just looking
for your laxatives.

01:16:24.298 --> 01:16:26.898
Not for me.
Yeah, that'll be aisle 5.

01:16:29.368 --> 01:16:31.603
Okay. Okay.

01:16:31.605 --> 01:16:35.106
Go back to aisle 5...
With the fucking medicine...

01:16:35.108 --> 01:16:37.209
And no laxatives.

01:16:37.211 --> 01:16:40.979
That's what I'll do, I'll look
at all the same shit...

01:16:40.981 --> 01:16:42.214
I already looked at.

01:16:42.216 --> 01:16:44.950
My god, I fucking hate this
place.

01:16:44.952 --> 01:16:48.186
I fucking hate this, aspirin,
I fucking hate this...

01:16:48.188 --> 01:16:51.423
Fucking Robitussin, fucking
q-tips.

01:16:51.425 --> 01:16:54.092
What the fuck, this fucking
lady?

01:16:54.094 --> 01:16:58.430
Fucking... oh, my god.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:05.303
What the fuck?
Where the fuck is it?

01:17:05.305 --> 01:17:07.472
I'm a fucking good person.

01:17:07.474 --> 01:17:10.575
I'm a fucking good person!
Where are the laxatives?

01:17:10.577 --> 01:17:13.211
I just fucking want
to find the laxatives.

01:17:13.213 --> 01:17:17.182
Where the fuck are the
laxatives?

01:17:22.388 --> 01:17:24.489
Are you okay?

01:17:28.027 --> 01:17:33.965
Um... I was just looking
for laxatives.

01:17:35.601 --> 01:17:39.404
They're right here...
In front of you.

01:17:44.343 --> 01:17:46.211
Thank you.

01:17:46.213 --> 01:17:48.914
Hope you feel better.

01:19:33.619 --> 01:19:37.222
Hey... you okay?

01:19:39.291 --> 01:19:41.526
I didn't get the show, so...

01:19:41.528 --> 01:19:45.263
Oh... shoot, I'm sorry.

01:19:45.265 --> 01:19:48.533
Yeah, this other guy got it.
I found out on Twitter.

01:19:48.535 --> 01:19:51.136
Oh, that's frustrating.

01:19:55.107 --> 01:19:58.343
Mike Madrigan, he's like eleven.

01:19:58.345 --> 01:20:01.613
An eleven-year-old.

01:20:01.615 --> 01:20:06.584
Maybe you weren't supposed
to get this job...

01:20:06.586 --> 01:20:09.387
So that you could be here.

01:20:09.389 --> 01:20:11.689
Everything happens for a reason.

01:20:11.691 --> 01:20:13.792
Yeah, I don't believe that.

01:20:23.636 --> 01:20:28.773
Listen, um...

01:20:28.775 --> 01:20:33.578
If you wanna invite
him to dinner sometime...

01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:37.682
Him, who?
That'd be...

01:20:37.684 --> 01:20:40.151
Paul.
Paul?

01:20:40.153 --> 01:20:42.620
Paul.
We broke up.

01:20:42.622 --> 01:20:45.123
So, you're too late.

01:20:45.125 --> 01:20:47.792
I'm sor... I didn't know you...
I didn't know you broke up.

01:20:47.794 --> 01:20:52.797
Oh my god. Oh, my god!
I just wanted to...

01:20:52.799 --> 01:20:56.367
We were together five years,
and he can come to dinner now?

01:20:56.369 --> 01:20:59.804
David, I just want...
What is this? What...

01:20:59.806 --> 01:21:03.374
You and I bought fucking diapers
together for her today.

01:21:03.376 --> 01:21:06.511
We sat with the hospice and
picked up medicine together.

01:21:06.513 --> 01:21:11.182
I've been fucking living
with you in your house...

01:21:11.184 --> 01:21:16.254
For 10 months...
And it's been good...

01:21:16.256 --> 01:21:19.757
Because I keep thinking, "oh, I
like the way he's helping mom".

01:21:19.759 --> 01:21:22.127
Or "maybe he's getting more
accepting"...

01:21:22.129 --> 01:21:23.661
But then it's like, you won't
even come up to my apartment...

01:21:23.663 --> 01:21:25.463
Whenever we're in New York?

01:21:25.465 --> 01:21:29.267
It's like this one little thing
and you won't do it!

01:21:29.269 --> 01:21:31.669
You won't!

01:21:31.671 --> 01:21:35.306
I'm gonna be fucking
30-years-old!

01:21:35.308 --> 01:21:38.476
And mom's gonna be dead,
and then what?

01:21:38.478 --> 01:21:46.251
Um, are we gonna be closer then?
Like, do I still come home?

01:21:46.253 --> 01:21:49.587
Or, what? Because I want to!
Of course, you come home.

01:21:49.589 --> 01:21:56.361
I want to want to! But it's
just... it's been ten years...

01:21:56.363 --> 01:22:02.233
And I will not be nervous saying
"he" or "boyfriend"...

01:22:02.235 --> 01:22:04.736
Around you anymore,
because it fucking sucks!

01:22:04.738 --> 01:22:07.605
It fucking sucks!

01:22:07.607 --> 01:22:10.842
And I've had such a shitty,
lonely year.

01:22:10.844 --> 01:22:16.347
And I can't bother mom
with any of this...

01:22:16.349 --> 01:22:18.316
And I can't talk to you
about any of this.

01:22:18.318 --> 01:22:19.851
So, what am I supposed to do?

01:22:19.853 --> 01:22:21.653
I can't even talk to you
about the fact that I'm gay.

01:22:21.655 --> 01:22:24.322
Of course, you can talk to me.
No, I can't.

01:22:24.324 --> 01:22:29.761
About that, David, I've always
said, I'm available any time...

01:22:29.763 --> 01:22:33.264
You want to debate that.
It's not a fucking debate!

01:22:35.467 --> 01:22:37.602
It's not a fucking debate.

01:22:48.347 --> 01:22:51.683
I'm sorry I keep cursing at
church, but I feel a lot better.

01:22:51.685 --> 01:22:53.484
I don't give a shit.

01:22:55.955 --> 01:22:57.989
And I haven't been working out.

01:22:57.991 --> 01:22:59.657
I went to the gym once...

01:22:59.659 --> 01:23:02.360
And I just sat in my car
and read us weekly.

01:23:07.967 --> 01:23:10.868
Anything else you want
to talk about?

01:23:13.272 --> 01:23:17.909
When mom dies, Paul's coming.

01:23:17.911 --> 01:23:21.613
I want him here,
so Paul's coming.

01:23:35.494 --> 01:23:38.363
Hi, Joanne! Can you see me?

01:23:38.365 --> 01:23:39.430
Hi.
We can see you, hi!

01:23:39.432 --> 01:23:40.865
<i>Can you see me, guys?</i>

01:23:40.867 --> 01:23:43.501
Yes, we can see you, Patti,
just talk!

01:23:43.503 --> 01:23:44.736
<i>Can you see me?</i>

01:23:44.738 --> 01:23:46.371
Yes, just talk.
Just say anything.

01:23:46.373 --> 01:23:47.805
What's wrong?
<i>Other than, can you see me.</i>

01:23:47.807 --> 01:23:50.608
<i>Can you see me, all of you?</i>
Mm-hm.

01:23:50.610 --> 01:23:53.411
Oh, Joanne, look at you!
You look beautiful!

01:23:53.413 --> 01:23:55.413
Thank you.

01:23:55.415 --> 01:23:58.549
<i>Joanne, Fletcher's here!</i>
Steve... that's funny.

01:23:58.551 --> 01:24:00.685
Love those.
<i>Joanne, I forgot to tell you!</i>

01:24:00.687 --> 01:24:02.687
<i>I'm glad that I didn't heal
you with that wand.</i>

01:24:02.689 --> 01:24:05.790
<i>That pastor's in prison now,
computer scam or something.</i>

01:24:05.792 --> 01:24:07.659
<i>I don't want to hog this...</i>

01:24:07.661 --> 01:24:08.960
<i>Because everyone's been wanti"
to say hi to you.</i>

01:24:08.962 --> 01:24:10.528
<i>Hi, Joanne!</i>

01:24:10.530 --> 01:24:11.896
Hey!
Bride, the blushing bride!

01:24:11.898 --> 01:24:13.498
<i>Hi!</i>
You look so pretty.

01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:14.966
<i>Wait, what was that?</i>

01:24:14.968 --> 01:24:17.502
Joanne said you look so pretty.
You look so pretty.

01:24:17.504 --> 01:24:20.004
Joanne wants you to know how
gorgeous you look.

01:24:20.006 --> 01:24:22.707
<i>Oh, thank you, thank you,
so do you!</i>

01:24:22.709 --> 01:24:24.575
I dressed up for your wedding.

01:24:24.577 --> 01:24:26.711
She's all dressed up.
She's got her party dress on.

01:24:26.713 --> 01:24:28.546
<i>Oh!</i>

01:24:28.548 --> 01:24:29.781
She's wearing that 70's dress
from new year's.

01:24:29.783 --> 01:24:31.582
With the boots, remember
the white boots?

01:24:31.584 --> 01:24:33.885
She just wanted to get
dressed up.

01:24:33.887 --> 01:24:37.855
<i>Oh! Hey! It's Lynne!
Is that you? It is you!</i>

01:24:37.857 --> 01:24:40.491
Hi.
<i>Hi! It's Lynne!</i>

01:24:40.493 --> 01:24:42.427
I like your hair.
<i>What?</i>

01:24:42.429 --> 01:24:43.995
Joanne... she likes your hair.
She likes your hair.

01:24:43.997 --> 01:24:45.997
Your hair, yes, it's short.

01:24:45.999 --> 01:24:47.665
Your hair.
Your hair.

01:24:47.667 --> 01:24:49.334
<i>What?
Is this a movie?</i>

01:24:49.336 --> 01:24:50.668
<i>What are we looking at?</i>

01:24:50.670 --> 01:24:52.103
Hi, grandma and grandpa.

01:24:52.105 --> 01:24:53.571
Who's that?

01:24:53.573 --> 01:24:55.373
That's grandma and grandpa.

01:24:55.375 --> 01:24:58.376
<i>Get in, so she can see.</i>
It's too many people.

01:24:58.378 --> 01:25:00.878
<i>Hi! Hi, mom!</i>

01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:05.350
Oh, Becc, you look so beautiful.

01:25:05.352 --> 01:25:07.985
She says you look so beautiful.

01:25:07.987 --> 01:25:10.722
<i>Thank you, mom, you do, too.</i>

01:25:10.724 --> 01:25:12.890
I wore my new year's dress.

01:25:12.892 --> 01:25:14.926
<i>Okay, Joanne, we gotta
get seated.</i>

01:25:14.928 --> 01:25:17.061
<i>I love you, mom,
I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

01:25:17.063 --> 01:25:19.764
I love you the whole world,
Beccah.

01:25:19.766 --> 01:25:21.632
<i>Say bye!
Bye!</i>

01:25:21.634 --> 01:25:23.101
<i>Say goodbye, everybody!</i>

01:25:23.103 --> 01:25:25.036
<i>Bye! Bye!
Bye!</i>

01:25:25.038 --> 01:25:29.507
<i>I love you! Miss you!</i>

01:25:29.509 --> 01:25:32.510
<i>Pastor to have and to
hold, from this day forward.</i>

01:25:32.512 --> 01:25:34.846
<i>In sickness and in health.</i>

01:25:34.848 --> 01:25:37.615
<i>So long as you both shall live?
I do.</i>

01:25:37.617 --> 01:25:40.785
<i>Then with the power vested in
me, by the Lutheran church...</i>

01:25:40.787 --> 01:25:42.653
<i>And the state of Minnesota...</i>

01:25:42.655 --> 01:25:44.689
<i>I pronounce you husband
and wife.</i>

01:25:44.691 --> 01:25:46.858
<i>So you may kiss the bride.</i>

01:25:57.669 --> 01:25:59.704
It's really nice out.

01:25:59.706 --> 01:26:02.940
I might just sit down just
for like a minute.

01:26:02.942 --> 01:26:04.675
Yeah.

01:26:37.709 --> 01:26:39.477
Mom?

01:26:41.547 --> 01:26:46.851
You're okay. It's okay,
you're okay.

01:26:46.853 --> 01:26:48.486
Help me up...

01:26:48.488 --> 01:26:52.857
Use my arm.
David, I was trying to...

01:26:52.859 --> 01:26:55.993
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay, it's okay.

01:26:57.930 --> 01:27:01.699
You're okay. You're okay.

01:27:01.701 --> 01:27:04.168
That scared me.

01:27:07.072 --> 01:27:11.776
You're okay.
I feel so embarrassed.

01:27:11.778 --> 01:27:14.645
It happens.

01:27:16.515 --> 01:27:20.117
I'm embarrassed.
Don't be.

01:27:21.954 --> 01:27:26.924
Oh, David, at the wedding,
they saw me...

01:27:26.926 --> 01:27:31.128
They saw me and they felt bad
for me, I got so confused.

01:27:33.532 --> 01:27:36.901
I don't want to do this anymore.

01:27:36.903 --> 01:27:41.239
I hate that this
is happening to you.

01:27:44.243 --> 01:27:51.115
I'm tired. I don't want you
to think I'm giving up.

01:27:51.117 --> 01:27:55.620
No, if it's time for you to
rest, we want you to rest.

01:27:55.622 --> 01:28:01.859
I tried so hard.
I know, you did.

01:28:08.033 --> 01:28:11.068
Thank you for coming here.
So nice of you to come here.

01:28:11.070 --> 01:28:13.304
I know it's hard for you.

01:28:13.306 --> 01:28:16.974
I really appreciate it.

01:28:20.245 --> 01:28:23.681
Paul and I broke up.

01:28:23.683 --> 01:28:26.083
I know.

01:28:31.123 --> 01:28:34.091
It's okay.

01:28:34.093 --> 01:28:41.232
And I didn't get that job,
but I promise I'm gonna be okay.

01:28:41.234 --> 01:28:42.800
You don't have to worry
about me.

01:28:42.802 --> 01:28:44.702
I don't worry.

01:28:44.704 --> 01:28:47.305
There's something else
that I'm working on...

01:28:47.307 --> 01:28:52.710
And I know my apartment
is small, but I'll be okay.

01:28:52.712 --> 01:28:54.979
No, yeah.

01:28:54.981 --> 01:28:58.049
Just see your sisters.

01:28:58.051 --> 01:29:01.953
What?

01:29:01.955 --> 01:29:07.692
I used to be so scared
you'd all forget about me.

01:29:07.694 --> 01:29:10.294
But I walked by the pictures
of the three of you...

01:29:10.296 --> 01:29:14.231
And I see me in each of you.

01:29:14.233 --> 01:29:16.634
So I know that you won't
forget about me...

01:29:16.636 --> 01:29:20.204
Because I'm right there
in all your faces.

01:29:20.206 --> 01:29:22.773
We could never forget about you.

01:29:23.809 --> 01:29:27.044
That's nice.

01:29:27.046 --> 01:29:30.314
When you miss me
and you want to see me...

01:29:30.316 --> 01:29:33.951
You just come home
and see your sisters.

01:29:33.953 --> 01:29:35.853
You gotta be good to them,
David.

01:29:35.855 --> 01:29:40.157
Take care of them.
Be a good big brother, okay?

01:29:40.159 --> 01:29:42.159
They're your sisters.

01:29:44.930 --> 01:29:46.931
I promise, I will, I'm sorry.

01:29:46.933 --> 01:29:49.400
Nothing else matters.

01:29:49.402 --> 01:29:52.169
I will, I promise.
See your sisters.

01:29:52.171 --> 01:29:54.205
It's very important.
I promise, I will.

01:29:54.207 --> 01:29:56.307
Nothing else matters.

01:29:56.309 --> 01:29:59.143
I promise.

01:29:59.145 --> 01:30:00.878
You have such a big heart.

01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:02.747
I love you.

01:30:02.749 --> 01:30:06.250
Take care of them, okay? Because
they're your little sisters.

01:30:06.252 --> 01:30:10.221
I will, I promise, I promise.

01:30:19.031 --> 01:30:23.034
Oh, she's gone. She's gone.

01:30:23.036 --> 01:30:26.871
We love you.

01:30:26.873 --> 01:30:29.840
We love you so much.

01:30:31.276 --> 01:30:34.378
I love you.
I love you.
