01:51.671 --> 01:53.572
What?

03:11.717 --> 03:13.585
Katie, you in there?

03:16.823 --> 03:18.991
Katie, time to go.

03:26.165 --> 03:28.067
I'm staying in Hammonton
tonight.

03:28.100 --> 03:29.434
It's no problem.

04:09.775 --> 04:11.010
What are you doing here?

04:11.878 --> 04:13.813
I need a ride, too.

04:27.727 --> 04:28.861
Stop.

04:55.021 --> 04:59.424
<i>Hey, Alicia,
I just wanted to see if you're all right.</i>

05:00.126 --> 05:02.594
<i>I heard Tyler got married
last night.</i>

05:04.764 --> 05:06.098
<i>Okay. Call me.</i>

06:25.644 --> 06:27.013
Oh, God.

06:47.199 --> 06:48.634
Hm.

07:27.339 --> 07:28.908
Good morning.

07:28.941 --> 07:30.676
Good morning, Lilith.

07:30.709 --> 07:32.344
Did you enjoy yourself
last night?

07:32.378 --> 07:34.280
Always.

07:34.313 --> 07:36.682
I'd say it was a
success, wouldn't you?

07:36.715 --> 07:37.750
I'd say.

07:37.783 --> 07:39.251
Did you sleep well?

07:40.186 --> 07:41.586
Oh, yeah.

07:42.254 --> 07:43.289
I did, too.

07:44.356 --> 07:46.826
I found since I quit drinking,
I sleep much better.

07:47.660 --> 07:49.128
I wouldn't know anything
about that.

07:49.161 --> 07:50.362
Mm-hmm.

07:50.396 --> 07:52.064
Why are you up so early?

07:52.798 --> 07:55.034
I received a phone call
I thought you should know about.

07:55.067 --> 07:56.969
Uh, anything important?

07:57.937 --> 08:01.040
It seems Katie Marro
was in an accident last night.

08:02.041 --> 08:05.077
Adorno, you know we invested
heavily in Katie.

08:05.111 --> 08:06.212
I know.

08:07.079 --> 08:08.881
She's not your average pop-tart.

08:10.249 --> 08:12.785
It's too bad it didn't work out.

08:12.818 --> 08:14.253
It happens.

08:14.286 --> 08:18.157
Well, with stardom comes power
and influence.

08:18.190 --> 08:19.692
You know that.

08:20.192 --> 08:21.994
I don't think you understand.

08:23.963 --> 08:26.198
Things did not proceed
as planned.

08:27.733 --> 08:28.767
Which part?

08:29.301 --> 08:30.769
None of it.

08:31.170 --> 08:32.671
What do you mean?

08:33.239 --> 08:35.307
There was an accident?

08:35.341 --> 08:38.910
They all died except Katie.

08:39.410 --> 08:40.779
Katie's alive?

08:41.981 --> 08:46.185
She is, she's in serious
condition, but she is alive.

08:46.218 --> 08:47.820
Where is she?

08:47.853 --> 08:48.954
Hammonton?

08:49.755 --> 08:50.990
I see.

08:52.825 --> 08:54.827
Where was it to take place?

08:54.860 --> 08:56.095
Her lake house.

08:57.163 --> 08:58.831
Do you think she caught on?

08:58.864 --> 09:00.299
Well, how should I know?

09:00.332 --> 09:02.701
We need to clean this up.
Henry was in that car.

09:02.735 --> 09:05.304
We need to have his information
redacted from the police report.

09:06.472 --> 09:09.108
Who do we have in Hammonton?

09:09.808 --> 09:11.076
No need.

09:11.110 --> 09:12.478
There's a woman.

09:12.511 --> 09:15.347
Alicia Gazzara. She has a copy.

09:15.381 --> 09:19.018
Apparently, she's an investigative
journalist with the Hammonton Herald.

09:19.051 --> 09:21.253
Ugh, I hate small towns.

09:22.054 --> 09:23.422
That's not all.

09:23.455 --> 09:27.259
Katie and this Alicia
were close, apparently.

09:28.894 --> 09:32.131
I'm assuming Alicia and the entire
town will take an interest in this.

09:32.164 --> 09:36.769
Oh, well, it looks like all the
stars aligned for Katie Marro.

09:37.336 --> 09:39.772
Too bad I'm going to have
to un-align them.

09:40.439 --> 09:44.877
I'll consult with my people about
preparing an official story for the media.

09:44.910 --> 09:48.147
I think Alicia Gazzara might
have a different story, my dear.

09:48.180 --> 09:50.316
Oh, of course.

09:52.918 --> 09:57.156
Hello, Alicia Gazzara
of bumble fuck Hammonton.

09:59.058 --> 10:01.293
Welcome to the rabbit hole.

10:12.571 --> 10:15.841
I can't believe she missed
another meeting this morning.

10:15.874 --> 10:17.142
I hope everything's okay.

10:17.176 --> 10:19.011
I'm gonna talk to her.

10:19.044 --> 10:20.813
The elections are coming up
and I'm going to be really busy.

10:20.846 --> 10:23.215
I can't do my job
if she doesn't do hers.

10:23.249 --> 10:24.950
I understand.

10:26.418 --> 10:28.120
Is she's still covering the red,
white and blueberry festival meetings?

10:28.153 --> 10:30.222
Yeah.

10:30.256 --> 10:32.858
Did I leave my lake water quality
committee folder in your office?

10:32.891 --> 10:34.927
You did. Yeah.
I made some additional notes

10:34.960 --> 10:36.929
and I think you should include
interviews with the Lake residents.

10:36.962 --> 10:38.163
I want to know their opinions.

10:38.197 --> 10:39.431
Good idea.

10:53.279 --> 10:56.849
Uh, do me a favor and take this
to the filing room. Thank you.

10:57.149 --> 10:58.584
Hey, Alicia.

10:58.617 --> 11:00.352
Can I have the accident report
in my office?

11:00.386 --> 11:02.388
Already got it. I was up early.

11:02.421 --> 11:04.890
Did you know Katie Marro was in
a car crash early this morning?

11:05.424 --> 11:06.558
Just heard about it.

11:07.727 --> 11:11.230
The chamber meeting you missed,
my room when you're ready.

11:17.303 --> 11:20.572
She was up early,
stayed up late is more like it.

11:22.308 --> 11:24.543
Go over my notes.

11:24.576 --> 11:28.280
Main issue seems to be the lowering of
the length and whether it's not necessary.

11:28.314 --> 11:30.349
Which month,
how many feet, duration?

11:30.382 --> 11:32.284
I don't think some of the Lake
residents are happy about it.

11:32.318 --> 11:33.252
Did you find out why?

11:33.285 --> 11:34.353
I'm on it.

11:35.921 --> 11:38.090
Hi, Rusty.

11:38.123 --> 11:40.192
Hey, Giana.

11:40.225 --> 11:43.462
About Katie's accident, I was wondering
if I could work on this today.

11:43.495 --> 11:47.066
I've been researching the passengers
and something doesn't add up.

11:47.099 --> 11:48.967
What's up?

11:49.001 --> 11:51.503
Well, the three men that were
in the car with Katie all died.

11:51.537 --> 11:53.472
Katie's the only survivor.

11:54.039 --> 11:56.141
Okay.

11:56.175 --> 11:58.645
Well, one of the guys, the guy in
the passenger seat, Henry Lee Lucas,

11:58.678 --> 12:01.280
he was a self-confessed
convicted serial killer.

12:01.313 --> 12:03.182
Are you serious?

12:03.215 --> 12:05.584
And Jon De Bauer who was
in the backseat with Katie,

12:05.617 --> 12:09.621
he was heir to the global
pharmaceutical giant BNB enterprises.

12:09.656 --> 12:11.357
I haven't gotten
to the third guy yet.

12:11.390 --> 12:14.159
Maybe he's a lion
that needed some courage.

12:15.160 --> 12:17.196
I'm sorry.

12:17.229 --> 12:19.198
The serial killer thing just struck
me as being a little farfetched.

12:19.231 --> 12:21.668
I know it sounds crazy,
but it's true.

12:21.701 --> 12:23.502
I'd really like to keep
working on this.

12:23.535 --> 12:25.504
Katie and I
used to be really close.

12:25.537 --> 12:27.005
Yeah, I remember.

12:27.039 --> 12:28.440
You were friends
with Katie Marro?

12:28.474 --> 12:30.376
Katie Marro was born
and raised here.

12:30.409 --> 12:32.478
I know that.
Everybody knows that.

12:32.511 --> 12:34.546
- I just...
- Didn't think we'd be friends?

12:34.580 --> 12:37.216
- No, I just...
- You just what, Giana?

12:37.983 --> 12:39.985
I just didn't think you two
were the same age.

12:40.018 --> 12:41.253
Thanks.

12:41.286 --> 12:43.622
Alicia,
I didn't mean it like that.

12:43.656 --> 12:46.358
I think your relationship
with Katie is a good thing.

12:46.392 --> 12:48.994
Just be sure to work with someone
that could double check your research.

12:49.027 --> 12:50.329
That's all.

12:50.362 --> 12:52.331
I don't need help
with my research.

12:52.364 --> 12:53.565
You can look up the names yourself.
Here's the police report.

12:53.599 --> 12:55.100
No, I trust your research.

12:55.134 --> 12:56.969
You just weren't yourself
last week.

12:57.002 --> 12:59.104
So I thought collaborating
with someone in the beginning

12:59.138 --> 13:01.473
might be helpful until you
get your life back on track.

13:01.507 --> 13:06.078
It's unprofessional to bring up a coworker's
personal life during a meeting, Giana.

13:06.111 --> 13:08.447
It's unprofessional
to skip meetings

13:08.480 --> 13:10.549
and expect others
to do the work for you.

13:10.582 --> 13:13.653
I don't expect anything,
especially from a 22-year-old,

13:13.686 --> 13:15.621
who can't even begin to understand
what I was going through.

13:15.655 --> 13:18.557
All right. Let's move on.

13:19.191 --> 13:22.428
Rusty, I'm gonna go call my aunt.
She works at the hospital.

13:22.461 --> 13:23.730
That might be helpful.

13:23.763 --> 13:25.197
Is that okay?

13:25.230 --> 13:26.432
Yeah, it's fine.

13:37.576 --> 13:40.747
Rusty, I need this story.
I can do this.

13:40.780 --> 13:43.081
The Marros were like
a second family to me.

13:43.115 --> 13:45.384
No one else has my connections
to this family.

13:45.417 --> 13:47.986
This is personal.

13:48.020 --> 13:51.590
This is Katie's story and a lot of people
in this town are interested in it already.

13:51.623 --> 13:53.158
Your research has to be spot on.

13:53.192 --> 13:55.227
My research is always spot on.

13:55.260 --> 13:57.329
So Katie's in serious condition

13:57.362 --> 14:00.032
and the other three male
passengers are definitely dead.

14:00.065 --> 14:03.335
My aunt also said that it's a
really weird scene at the hospital.

14:03.368 --> 14:06.739
A lot of out-of-towners wearing
black and carrying two phones.

14:07.439 --> 14:09.007
Thanks, Giana.

14:10.342 --> 14:11.343
Thanks again for covering the
chamber meeting this morning.

14:11.376 --> 14:12.344
I appreciate it.

14:12.377 --> 14:14.079
No problem.

14:14.112 --> 14:15.981
Let me know if you need help
with anything else.

14:21.153 --> 14:24.189
Rusty, my research
is meticulous.

14:24.223 --> 14:26.391
I worked at one of the best
newspapers in Philadelphia.

14:26.425 --> 14:28.160
Not anymore.

14:28.460 --> 14:30.697
You work here now and you've
barely been doing that lately.

14:30.730 --> 14:35.033
Last week was difficult for me for
personal reasons, but that's all over.

14:35.067 --> 14:36.435
I'm back on track.

14:36.468 --> 14:38.437
Last week,
you were late more than once.

14:38.470 --> 14:40.773
You missed a chamber meeting
and you missed two deadlines.

14:40.807 --> 14:43.810
And I also noticed that you left
early on Friday to go to a nada.

14:43.843 --> 14:46.646
Friday was my worst day.
That's not who I am.

14:46.679 --> 14:48.681
I should've taken
a mental health day.

14:48.715 --> 14:51.383
Yet, well, when you're at
work, I need you to be focused.

14:51.416 --> 14:55.420
Hammonton turns a 150 in March, and we're going
to get busier than usual covering events.

14:59.157 --> 15:00.592
We were just asked
by the Kiwanis Club

15:00.627 --> 15:02.294
to do a story
on this commemorative blanket.

15:02.327 --> 15:05.264
Rusty, please.
Let me do this story on Katie.

15:05.297 --> 15:08.668
I feel inspired and I haven't
felt this way in a while.

15:08.701 --> 15:10.770
I can't write
about a fucking blanket.

15:10.803 --> 15:15.340
I need a story that will give me
back my focus. And this is it.

15:17.342 --> 15:19.144
You know why
I hired you back, Alicia?

15:20.479 --> 15:22.047
It wasn't charity.

15:22.080 --> 15:25.384
You have the credentials, but if I give
you Katie's story and you mess it up,

15:27.352 --> 15:28.587
that'll be your last chance.

15:29.956 --> 15:32.624
I won't mess this up. You have my word.
That's all in the past.

15:32.659 --> 15:35.327
I won't let you down. I promise.

15:38.263 --> 15:41.768
Let me think about it.

15:42.635 --> 15:46.138
Well, can I at least stop by later
to show you what I've done so far?

15:47.907 --> 15:49.842
Yeah, it'd be fine.

17:06.417 --> 17:09.821
Passenger number
one, the driver.

17:09.856 --> 17:13.826
General Mitchell Black,
retired army intelligence officer

17:13.859 --> 17:16.863
who specialized
in psychological operations.

17:16.896 --> 17:20.432
Wrote a book titled,
<i>Silent Weapons for Silent Wars</i>,

17:20.464 --> 17:23.636
which lays out a step-by-step
plan to conquer the world

17:23.670 --> 17:28.205
through propaganda,
currency devaluation, economic shock,

17:28.240 --> 17:30.475
and constant warfare.

17:30.977 --> 17:33.813
His second book was titled,

17:33.846 --> 17:38.751
<i>Sex, Drugs, and Rock & Roll: How the Aquarian
Conspiracy Killed the American Family.</i>

17:39.284 --> 17:42.487
His third book was titled,
<i>A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing,</i>

17:42.521 --> 17:45.892
<i>The Fabian Society</i>,
<i>Tavistock and the Beatles.</i>

17:45.925 --> 17:48.961
He also co-wrote
the Satanic Bible.

17:49.862 --> 17:51.731
Sounds like a nice guy,
easy going.

17:53.498 --> 17:55.902
Passenger number two, backseat.

17:55.935 --> 17:57.970
Jon De Bauer the fourth,

17:58.004 --> 18:01.808
billionaire heir to the family
pharmaceutical fortune BNB enterprises

18:01.841 --> 18:03.876
worth about 26 billion.

18:04.476 --> 18:07.814
Personal net worth
an estimated one billion.

18:07.847 --> 18:11.751
Founded the charity
World Vision Global Foundation,

18:11.784 --> 18:16.321
which is currently under investigation
for a food for sex scandal in Haiti.

18:17.056 --> 18:21.359
He has been described
as a jet setter who enjoys polo,

18:21.393 --> 18:23.395
playmates and philanthropy.

18:23.428 --> 18:24.463
Wow.

18:26.632 --> 18:29.702
Passenger number
three, Henry Lee Lucas,

18:29.736 --> 18:34.040
passenger seat,
a self-confessed serial killer.

18:34.073 --> 18:39.411
He was sentenced to between 20 to 40
years imprisonment for killing his mother.

18:39.444 --> 18:42.614
While in custody,
he confessed to over 60 murders.

18:42.648 --> 18:45.484
Some of his alleged treatment
was odd for someone

18:45.517 --> 18:48.620
whom the police believed
to be a cunning mass murderer.

18:48.654 --> 18:54.493
He was rarely handcuffed, often allowed
to wander police stations in jails at will

18:54.526 --> 18:57.529
and even knew the codes
to the security doors.

18:58.597 --> 19:02.068
He also confessed
to being a professional assassin

19:02.101 --> 19:06.973
and that his murders were not
random, just made to look that way.

19:07.006 --> 19:09.842
He was pardoned one week before
he was scheduled to be executed

19:09.876 --> 19:12.879
by then governor of Texas,
George W. Bush,

19:12.912 --> 19:15.815
who had his death sentence
commuted to life in prison.

19:16.448 --> 19:21.888
Besides murder, he was involved with a
Satanic cult called the Hand of Death Cult.

19:22.822 --> 19:25.992
He was also friends with Otis
Toole, the serial killer,

19:26.025 --> 19:29.394
who confessed
to murdering Adam Walsh.

19:29.427 --> 19:33.666
And not one news outlet to date
has even mentioned his name.

19:33.699 --> 19:35.968
In literally,
every article I read online,

19:36.002 --> 19:39.304
these guys are mentioned
as the other passengers.

19:40.539 --> 19:41.974
Can't figure it out.

19:42.642 --> 19:45.544
I'm not a conspiracy theorist,
but this.

19:45.577 --> 19:47.747
We have to consider
all the possibilities

19:47.780 --> 19:51.483
and it might be true that the rich
and powerful entities in Hollywood

19:51.516 --> 19:55.453
want this to go away because
Katie's new movie comes out soon.

19:58.057 --> 20:03.562
Passenger number four,
Catherine Heather Marro. Backseat.

20:03.595 --> 20:09.467
Hammontonian, former Blueberry Queen,
University of the Arts graduate,

20:09.501 --> 20:12.805
Broadway actress,
and soon to be international movie star

20:12.839 --> 20:17.009
when her film, <i>The Supernatural
Secrets of Big Business Success</i>

20:17.043 --> 20:18.978
is released on Halloween.

20:20.713 --> 20:22.547
Okay.

20:24.150 --> 20:28.386
So, most likely, these guys
were taking Katie to her house.

20:28.955 --> 20:30.923
Was she commuting
to New York City?

20:30.957 --> 20:32.124
She could have.

20:32.158 --> 20:33.592
New York's only 90 miles
from here.

20:33.625 --> 20:35.628
And yet a world away.

20:35.661 --> 20:41.499
So where were they coming from?
That's the question.

20:42.001 --> 20:44.402
We could ask Joeboy
to check the GPS.

20:44.904 --> 20:45.771
Good idea.

20:46.939 --> 20:51.509
Why were these four people
in the same car?

20:52.178 --> 20:54.113
That's what you're going
to find out.

20:54.847 --> 20:57.582
Thank you. I won't let you down.

20:57.616 --> 21:00.452
I've been up all night
working on this.

21:00.485 --> 21:02.420
I can tell. It's impressive.

21:03.723 --> 21:04.824
Good job.

21:06.225 --> 21:12.397
Well, it's getting late. You must
be exhausted. Let's call it a day.

21:12.965 --> 21:15.433
Maybe we could grab lunch
tomorrow

21:15.467 --> 21:17.136
and begin to wrap our heads
around all this.

21:17.169 --> 21:18.905
I'd love to hear your thoughts.

21:19.839 --> 21:23.608
Yeah, working lunch
would be fine.

21:23.643 --> 21:24.944
Annata at one?

21:24.977 --> 21:25.878
Sounds good.

21:26.611 --> 21:28.748
Rusty, thanks again.

21:28.781 --> 21:31.117
It means the world to me
that you gave me this story,

21:31.150 --> 21:32.952
especially after the week
I have had.

21:33.786 --> 21:36.055
I matched the right person
with the right story.

21:37.189 --> 21:38.891
I thought you were perfect
for this.

21:38.925 --> 21:41.928
I'm ready for bed.

22:14.160 --> 22:16.262
Rusty. How are you?

22:16.295 --> 22:17.763
How are you?

22:17.797 --> 22:19.497
What's Miss New Jersey
doing home?

22:19.531 --> 22:21.634
Back to find your roots?

22:21.667 --> 22:24.270
Sure. I really wanted to see
Katie, but they wouldn't let me in.

22:24.303 --> 22:25.537
So sad.

22:25.570 --> 22:26.706
Yeah, absolutely.

22:26.739 --> 22:27.740
Brendan's off this weekend.

22:27.773 --> 22:28.674
Have you guys met?

22:28.708 --> 22:29.909
We've not met. Big fan.

22:29.942 --> 22:30.977
- Oh, really?
- Absolutely.

22:31.010 --> 22:33.145
Awesome.

22:33.179 --> 22:34.647
What happened last weekend? Pulled the
flag on you a little earlier there.

22:34.680 --> 22:36.215
Yeah, I threw
the caution note out

22:36.248 --> 22:38.084
before I took the lead
so I ended up getting third.

22:38.117 --> 22:40.186
Criminal. Criminal.

22:40.219 --> 22:42.121
Well, it'd be great to get
an interview before you go.

22:42.154 --> 22:45.124
Ah, maybe. I'm leaving town,
so might miss me.

22:45.157 --> 22:46.792
- Next time. We'll see you.
- All right. Next time.

22:46.826 --> 22:48.027
Nice to see everybody.
Hey, nice to meet you.

22:48.060 --> 22:49.128
- Nice to meet you.
- Take care.

22:50.562 --> 22:52.231
Hey, ladies.

22:52.264 --> 22:54.100
- How is everybody doing? Good?
- Hey, how are you?

22:54.133 --> 22:56.568
You, too. Get that subscription
back, all right?

23:06.212 --> 23:08.114
Hey, Rusty.

23:09.915 --> 23:11.217
Anything new?

23:21.360 --> 23:25.231
Still no mention of the pastor's
identities anywhere.

23:25.264 --> 23:29.668
How Henry Lee Lucas
isn't front page news is beyond me?

23:29.702 --> 23:30.970
Should've lost sleep
over that guy?

23:31.771 --> 23:34.106
People like that
live in a parallel universe

23:34.140 --> 23:36.876
and rarely come in contact
with the little people.

23:37.309 --> 23:39.712
What do you mean?

23:39.745 --> 23:42.915
Have you ever crossed paths with an
international playboy billionaire

23:42.948 --> 23:45.918
from one of the most
elite families on Earth

23:45.951 --> 23:51.323
or a former army intelligence
officer and published author?

23:52.191 --> 23:55.761
Or a convicted murderer who
spent most of his life in jail?

23:55.795 --> 23:57.129
No, and I wouldn't want to.

23:57.163 --> 24:00.800
Well, Lucas is a whole
other story.

24:00.833 --> 24:06.705
It's just intriguing that somehow
they were in Katie's circle.

24:07.339 --> 24:09.008
I know.

24:10.810 --> 24:13.879
It's difficult for me to believe that Katie
would willingly go anywhere with men like that.

24:14.380 --> 24:17.817
We're in the big leagues now
where the rules don't apply.

24:19.151 --> 24:20.152
In what way?

24:21.153 --> 24:23.889
What did everyone in that car
have in common?

24:23.923 --> 24:28.027
They were either rich,
powerful or connected.

24:28.894 --> 24:30.229
Well, to get dirty.

24:30.262 --> 24:31.831
Ah, that goes without saying.

24:31.864 --> 24:34.166
My mom used to say,
"If you see a rich man,

24:34.200 --> 24:37.736
you better believe he stepped on a
whole bunch of people to get there."

24:38.871 --> 24:40.239
I don't believe that.

24:40.806 --> 24:42.408
I know a lot of well-off people
who live in this town

24:42.441 --> 24:44.677
and who do a lot
for this community.

24:45.377 --> 24:48.114
They're not the people
I'm talking about.

24:48.147 --> 24:53.385
The people we know are average people
who were smart with their money.

24:53.419 --> 24:57.256
I'm talking about the very rich
and the very wealthy

24:57.289 --> 24:59.658
and the very
well-connected people

24:59.692 --> 25:02.228
that we peasants
never come in contact with.

25:03.395 --> 25:05.297
They own
billion-dollar companies

25:05.331 --> 25:08.234
and don't pay taxes
and live above the law

25:08.267 --> 25:11.237
and control just about
everything on this planet.

25:12.972 --> 25:14.974
Now you sound like
a conspiracy theorist.

25:15.007 --> 25:19.945
I'm the opposite of a
conspiracy theorist. I'm a realist.

25:20.980 --> 25:22.414
Let me ask you something.

25:23.816 --> 25:27.419
Do you believe that anyone with
any real power is a good person?

25:28.220 --> 25:30.189
I prefer not to make
blanket statements.

25:31.123 --> 25:32.858
The answer is no.

25:33.859 --> 25:36.195
Oh, and how are you so sure?

25:36.228 --> 25:41.467
Look at the world we live in. It's evil
and the fish rots from the head down.

25:41.500 --> 25:43.936
And here's the thing.
I don't blame them.

25:43.969 --> 25:46.705
Most people can't think
for themselves,

25:46.739 --> 25:49.141
so they're just begging
to be taken advantage of.

25:49.175 --> 25:51.143
That's why our
medium is so powerful

25:51.177 --> 25:54.213
and why we need to be
so careful with this story.

25:55.814 --> 25:56.882
Do you have any specials?

25:56.916 --> 25:58.083
Hi, June. How are you?

25:58.117 --> 25:59.418
Hey, I'm good, Rusty.

25:59.451 --> 26:01.320
Uh, we have eggplant parm today.

26:01.353 --> 26:04.190
Uh, I'll take that and an
iced tea with lemon. Thanks.

26:04.223 --> 26:06.759
- Same. Thanks, June.
- You got it.

26:08.460 --> 26:14.333
So in your opinion,
those men were in Katie's social circle.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.971
Or she knew who they were.
Look at the Epstein case.

26:19.004 --> 26:22.441
People from all different walks of
life were connected to that guy.

26:24.977 --> 26:26.912
So what are you trying to say?

26:26.946 --> 26:30.149
There must be a connecting
factor that we're missing.

26:31.850 --> 26:36.222
Maybe we should check to see if Jon
De Bauer invested in any of Katie's movies.

26:37.122 --> 26:40.526
If that's the case, then she could
have been taking him back to her place.

26:40.559 --> 26:43.262
Oh, come on,
Katie never struck me as that type.

26:43.295 --> 26:45.164
Look what came out
with Weinstein.

26:45.197 --> 26:47.299
A lot of women felt
they had no option.

26:47.333 --> 26:50.035
They either slept with the
producer or never worked again.

26:51.203 --> 26:52.738
It's crazy.

26:54.273 --> 26:57.843
Supposedly, his behavior was well-known
in Hollywood, yet they were complicit.

26:57.876 --> 27:00.346
Yeah, the casting couch
has been around forever.

27:00.379 --> 27:01.413
It doesn't make it right.

27:01.447 --> 27:02.881
Oh, I know.

27:02.915 --> 27:05.050
Another thing,

27:05.084 --> 27:07.486
Katie's not super-famous yet but she
will be when the film is released.

27:07.519 --> 27:09.288
So we got to get
the story out by then.

27:09.321 --> 27:11.790
Her film is set to be released
on Halloween.

27:11.824 --> 27:14.560
Mm-hmm, yeah, well, I feel like
I stepped into the twilight zone.

27:14.593 --> 27:16.128
I know.

27:17.496 --> 27:19.565
I don't want this story to read
like some crazy conspiracy theory

27:19.598 --> 27:21.333
that makes me look ridiculous.

27:22.034 --> 27:24.236
Facts are facts.
The truth is the truth.

27:24.270 --> 27:26.905
Does the truth still exist
in our business?

27:26.939 --> 27:29.475
It does and it always will.

27:29.508 --> 27:32.044
The truth is what
actually happened, period.

27:33.012 --> 27:37.016
Not sure how far into Lucas
has criminal past I should go.

27:38.951 --> 27:41.954
Do I mention
the Satanic cult thing

27:41.987 --> 27:45.291
or what about the general
co-writing a Satanic Bible?

27:45.324 --> 27:46.892
What's up with that?

27:48.260 --> 27:50.362
I'd rather play up the
rich and powerful De Bauer family

27:50.396 --> 27:51.830
and Katie, then movie star.

27:52.965 --> 27:57.936
Let me think about it. Listing Lucas's
entire rap sheet isn't necessary.

27:58.470 --> 28:00.239
I mean, how does someone
like that even get pardoned?

28:00.272 --> 28:01.307
I don't know.

28:01.340 --> 28:03.442
I mean, he signed a confession.

28:03.475 --> 28:05.444
Why would a future president
of the United States

28:05.477 --> 28:08.280
and someone from such a
prominent political family

28:08.314 --> 28:09.515
pardon someone like that?

28:09.548 --> 28:12.318
He wasn't actually pardoned.

28:12.351 --> 28:16.989
His sentence was commuted to life in
prison instead of the death penalty

28:17.022 --> 28:20.559
because they couldn't prove
that the one murder

28:20.592 --> 28:25.030
for which he was sentenced to death
was actually committed by him.

28:25.064 --> 28:27.099
Great. I feel better now.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.301
So when are you going to talk
to Katie's family.

28:29.335 --> 28:30.969
I'm going first thing
in the morning.

28:31.003 --> 28:32.504
Good.

28:32.538 --> 28:34.306
See what information
you can find out from Peter.

28:34.340 --> 28:36.308
Maybe she got in
with a bad group,

28:36.342 --> 28:37.609
maybe something
as simple as that.

28:37.644 --> 28:39.011
Drugs.

28:39.611 --> 28:40.647
It was an issue before.

28:40.680 --> 28:42.414
True.

28:42.448 --> 28:45.317
The whole thing could have been
a drug deal gone bad.

28:46.251 --> 28:49.388
The drug world
makes strange bedfellows.

29:09.074 --> 29:10.576
Hi, Mr. Marro.

29:10.609 --> 29:13.646
Alicia, it's been a long time.
How have you been?

29:13.680 --> 29:16.348
I'm so sorry about Katie.
How is she?

29:17.249 --> 29:18.550
She's improving.

29:18.584 --> 29:20.285
Uh, the surgery
went well yesterday.

29:20.319 --> 29:21.420
That's good news.

29:21.453 --> 29:23.288
Yeah.

29:23.322 --> 29:25.624
So, I... I hear you're back
in town, working at the Herald.

29:25.658 --> 29:27.092
Yep.

29:27.126 --> 29:29.228
I've been here
almost six months.

29:29.261 --> 29:31.096
Good for you.

29:31.463 --> 29:34.133
I like it when the young choose to
bring their talents back to town.

29:34.734 --> 29:37.536
- It's good to be home.
- Yeah, yeah.

29:38.437 --> 29:40.072
Oh, Katie bought a home here.

29:40.539 --> 29:43.643
Yeah, we love having her
so close.

29:43.676 --> 29:45.477
Yeah, I heard.

29:45.511 --> 29:47.680
We've just never crossed paths.

29:48.580 --> 29:50.549
- Until now.
- Yeah.

29:52.284 --> 29:55.722
So, um, will the, uh, Herald be
writing a story about the accident?

29:55.755 --> 29:57.156
I think so.

29:58.290 --> 30:00.159
You've probably had a ton
of media interest, right?

30:01.293 --> 30:02.261
Not really.

30:03.562 --> 30:06.331
Who are all these people?

30:06.365 --> 30:07.667
I'm not sure.

30:07.700 --> 30:10.202
Supposedly Katie's manager
sent them.

30:11.303 --> 30:12.538
Makes sense.

30:12.571 --> 30:14.573
Not much else does.

30:17.309 --> 30:18.711
Hey, Eddie.

30:18.745 --> 30:21.681
Um, Alicia,
this is Katie's friend Eddie.

30:21.714 --> 30:23.650
I haven't seen you in forever.

30:23.683 --> 30:25.517
Yeah. And where have you been?

30:25.551 --> 30:27.986
I've been working in Philly
the past seven years.

30:28.020 --> 30:30.456
Oh, cool.
I heard you were back in town.

30:30.489 --> 30:34.259
Yep, started to work at the
Herald about six months ago.

30:35.461 --> 30:37.029
Cool.

30:37.062 --> 30:38.430
You, uh, you writing a story
about Katie?

30:38.464 --> 30:39.998
Yeah, most likely.

30:40.032 --> 30:42.100
So I heard you got the band
back together.

30:42.134 --> 30:44.136
- How's that going?
- It's great.

30:44.169 --> 30:47.506
Yeah, we, uh, we never broke up though.
We just took a hiatus.

30:47.539 --> 30:49.408
Our drummer went into rehab
so...

30:49.441 --> 30:50.677
Did you find a new drummer?

30:50.710 --> 30:52.611
No. No, Andy's back now.
He's great.

30:52.645 --> 30:55.180
He, um, he's actually expecting
a baby the next few months.

30:55.214 --> 30:56.683
Oh, great.

30:57.416 --> 30:59.251
What else have you been up to?

30:59.284 --> 31:01.654
You know, uh,
schedule's pretty packed, actually.

31:01.688 --> 31:05.324
We pretty much playing out everywhere we
can and play at Vinyl every Friday night.

31:05.357 --> 31:09.194
Uh, got a pretty big gig there coming
up for their 150th celebration.

31:09.228 --> 31:12.498
Oh, everyone has their own
definition of success.

31:12.531 --> 31:15.067
Truth. Yeah.

31:15.100 --> 31:18.370
You know, I find it, uh, kind of funny you're
the one writing the story about Katie.

31:20.172 --> 31:21.373
Yeah, we were close.

31:22.474 --> 31:25.077
I just hope I can give Katie
the story she deserves.

31:26.578 --> 31:30.616
Um, listen, uh, Alicia, well, we
should talk, okay, but... but not here.

31:30.650 --> 31:32.584
Let me give you my card.

31:32.618 --> 31:35.420
Um, give me a call tomorrow
if you get a minute.

31:38.490 --> 31:40.727
I'm, uh, I'm going to head in.

31:41.628 --> 31:42.561
Yeah.

31:42.594 --> 31:43.529
You sing to her?

31:44.731 --> 31:45.765
Yeah.

31:46.733 --> 31:48.467
Maybe I'll catch you at Vinyl.

31:49.301 --> 31:50.369
Cool.

31:52.504 --> 31:56.843
Peter, I got to go.
I will call you tomorrow. I promise.

31:56.876 --> 31:58.577
I'd appreciate that.
I really would.

32:00.579 --> 32:02.214
- We'll talk soon.
- Take care.

32:21.634 --> 32:22.835
Oh.

32:23.703 --> 32:25.638
Back off, bitch.

32:32.177 --> 32:34.479
- <i>Well, hello.</i>
- <i>Hey, Jack, can we meet?</i>

32:34.513 --> 32:36.315
<i>I miss you, too.</i>

32:36.348 --> 32:38.150
<i>I wanna talk to you
about Katie Marro.</i>

32:38.183 --> 32:39.618
<i>That's so crazy.
Did you read my piece today?</i>

32:39.652 --> 32:41.420
<i>I doubt she'll ever be the same.</i>

32:41.453 --> 32:43.422
<i>I did read it
and I have some questions.</i>

32:43.455 --> 32:45.223
<i>Can we meet tomorrow?</i>

32:45.257 --> 32:47.159
<i>Actually, I can probably
meet you tomorrow.</i>

32:47.192 --> 32:48.695
<i>I'll be passing Hammonton
on my way from the shore.</i>

32:48.728 --> 32:50.395
<i>I'll text you when I leave.
Good?</i>

32:50.429 --> 32:51.864
<i>Let's meet at the lake.</i>

32:51.898 --> 32:53.766
<i>I like it.
See you then, doll.</i>

33:28.233 --> 33:29.568
God, I miss those boots.

33:29.601 --> 33:31.370
How's the Drum?

33:31.403 --> 33:32.604
Great.

33:32.639 --> 33:33.873
- How's the Herald?
- Temporary.

33:33.906 --> 33:35.808
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

33:35.842 --> 33:37.644
You're too good to be writing
stories about tumbleweeds.

33:37.677 --> 33:39.812
Why didn't your article
on Katie's accident

33:39.846 --> 33:42.815
include any
of the passenger's identities?

33:42.849 --> 33:44.684
Uh, well, you're right.

33:44.717 --> 33:46.518
It mostly revolved around Katie Marro.
That's correct.

33:46.551 --> 33:48.821
Oh, why not cover
everyone equally?

33:48.855 --> 33:50.188
Because not everyone is equal.

33:50.823 --> 33:52.892
Come on, Jack.

33:52.925 --> 33:55.594
It wasn't an in-depth investigative
report if that's what you mean.

33:55.628 --> 33:58.296
We didn't get into every detail
of the passengers' lives.

33:58.330 --> 34:03.268
"Katie Marro suffers a major head
and back injuries in car crash."

34:03.301 --> 34:05.404
Yeah, that'll get
your attention.

34:05.437 --> 34:08.340
"There were three other people in
the vehicle, including the driver."

34:08.373 --> 34:09.942
And according
to the police report,

34:09.976 --> 34:12.444
all three were pronounced dead
at the scene.

34:12.476 --> 34:14.647
Names of the deceased
will not be released

34:14.681 --> 34:16.983
until their families
are contacted."

34:17.016 --> 34:18.650
Well, it's important
to be sensitive.

34:18.685 --> 34:20.351
Take into account
those families' feelings.

34:20.385 --> 34:22.688
Bullshit. I know you better
than that, Jack.

34:22.722 --> 34:26.625
The article goes on to mention
Katie's new film,

34:26.659 --> 34:29.661
her alcohol
and drug-induced past

34:29.696 --> 34:32.464
and her rumored affair
with her co-star

34:32.496 --> 34:35.233
and you end
with some random doctor

34:35.266 --> 34:38.235
stating that she could
have permanent brain damage.

34:38.270 --> 34:41.841
What the fuck? Do you even know
who was in that car with her?

34:41.873 --> 34:43.676
That's what people wanna read.

34:43.710 --> 34:45.342
She's even lucky
I said that much.

34:45.377 --> 34:46.779
Her name doesn't sell papers.

34:46.813 --> 34:47.914
It might sell
the Hammonton Herald, but...

34:47.947 --> 34:50.348
Did you even research those men?

34:50.650 --> 34:52.583
Where's this going?

34:52.617 --> 34:54.453
Henry Lee Lucas.

34:55.353 --> 34:56.856
I couldn't verify
his information.

34:56.889 --> 34:59.524
He was a convicted murderer,
Jack.

34:59.558 --> 35:02.260
Would a person like that even
have reliable identification?

35:02.294 --> 35:03.696
He wasn't carrying
identification.

35:03.730 --> 35:05.430
He was fingerprinted
at the scene.

35:05.464 --> 35:06.966
Didn't I read
that he was pardoned?

35:08.067 --> 35:12.905
I also read that he confessed to
being a professional assassin,

35:12.939 --> 35:15.675
- a member of the Hand of Death Cult,
- Uh-huh.

35:15.708 --> 35:19.746
those associated with kidnapping,
human trafficking, and Satanism.

35:19.779 --> 35:21.748
What the fuck was Katie doing
with that guy?

35:21.781 --> 35:24.684
I also read that his confessions
were mostly hoaxes.

35:24.717 --> 35:26.618
The guy was a pathological liar.

35:26.652 --> 35:30.890
I also read that his treatment
in prison was highly unusual.

35:30.923 --> 35:34.060
He was allowed to...
he was allowed to roam around the jail

35:34.093 --> 35:36.461
and he knew the codes
to the security doors?

35:36.495 --> 35:38.563
Oh, yeah, where'd you read that,
Wikipedia?

35:38.597 --> 35:40.066
Come on, Alicia.

35:40.099 --> 35:43.770
Then Bush commutes his sentence
to life in prison.

35:44.603 --> 35:46.839
Why?

35:46.873 --> 35:49.876
Bush was a big proponent of the death
penalty while he was governor of Texas.

35:49.909 --> 35:51.376
Bush looked at the evidence

35:51.409 --> 35:52.779
and realized
that the guy was lying

35:52.812 --> 35:54.747
about the murder
he was sentenced to die for.

35:54.781 --> 35:56.983
His confessions
were mostly lies.

35:57.016 --> 35:59.652
You can't sentence someone
to death for lying.

35:59.685 --> 36:03.488
Or did certain people want to
keep him around a little longer

36:03.522 --> 36:05.758
and use him
as their personal hitman?

36:05.792 --> 36:07.894
That's crazy talk.

36:07.927 --> 36:10.295
You know a hell of a lot more
than what you put in this article.

36:16.401 --> 36:18.303
I miss seeing you at work
every day.

36:22.374 --> 36:23.743
Did you get work done?
'Cause you look incredible.

36:23.776 --> 36:26.411
No, I can't afford
to get any work done.

36:26.444 --> 36:27.345
Oh.

36:29.548 --> 36:32.051
Do you know this woman named Giana?
She sent me her resume.

36:32.084 --> 36:35.587
Ugh. She's the worst.
I'm always fixing her shit.

36:35.620 --> 36:36.923
Really?

36:36.956 --> 36:39.457
Yeah.
My next stop is New York City.

36:39.491 --> 36:40.927
I can't wait to get the fuck
outta here.

36:40.960 --> 36:42.327
The Big Apple.

36:42.762 --> 36:44.997
- Any offers?
- Not yet.

36:45.031 --> 36:46.833
Maybe this story
will get me noticed.

36:46.866 --> 36:49.068
Yeah,
it'll get you noticed all right.

36:49.769 --> 36:52.705
Aren't you getting any good
assignments here in Hamilton?

36:52.738 --> 36:54.040
Hammonton.

36:55.407 --> 36:56.408
Right.

36:57.409 --> 37:01.479
Jack, is there something
you're not telling me?

37:01.513 --> 37:02.849
I know you.

37:04.116 --> 37:07.619
Why are you ignoring the most
bizarre facts about the story?

37:07.653 --> 37:10.622
Look, your mind is in overdrive.
Okay? I get it.

37:11.090 --> 37:13.491
You're stuck here
in this small town.

37:13.525 --> 37:16.461
You've had a hell of a year and
you're going stir crazy. I get it.

37:17.697 --> 37:19.098
But take it
from a fellow writer,

37:19.131 --> 37:23.870
all work and no play
makes Jack a dull boy.

37:23.903 --> 37:25.805
I'm not crazy, Jack.

37:25.838 --> 37:28.473
I just think this story is news.

37:28.506 --> 37:29.474
I don't.

37:29.507 --> 37:30.542
Stop gaslighting me.

37:30.575 --> 37:31.811
I'm not gaslighting you.

37:31.844 --> 37:33.145
Alicia, stop.

37:33.913 --> 37:35.480
Okay?

37:35.513 --> 37:37.149
You need a work environment
that's gonna...

37:37.183 --> 37:39.118
that's gonna guide
your intuition.

37:39.151 --> 37:40.619
Not confuse it.

37:41.220 --> 37:42.989
Don't let these
basic people insist

37:43.022 --> 37:44.957
that you write them
a sensational story

37:44.991 --> 37:47.459
just because they're bored
with their lives.

37:47.492 --> 37:48.761
You're too good for that.

37:48.794 --> 37:50.029
If you want to make it
in New York,

37:50.062 --> 37:50.997
you're going about it
the wrong way.

37:51.030 --> 37:51.964
Get smart.

37:51.998 --> 37:53.465
You just don't get it.

37:53.833 --> 37:55.635
Look, I got to go, okay?

37:55.668 --> 37:59.038
Don't let this story screw up
your chances for New York.

37:59.071 --> 38:02.507
If no other news outlet is making a big
deal out of it, there must be a reason.

38:04.911 --> 38:06.178
What's the reason?

38:06.979 --> 38:08.047
Let it go.

38:09.682 --> 38:10.783
Do you understand?

38:11.549 --> 38:12.985
Let it go.

38:14.954 --> 38:16.656
Trust me on this one.

38:41.948 --> 38:43.481
Hello.

38:43.515 --> 38:46.218
Well, you look every inch
the movie star.

38:46.252 --> 38:47.820
Where have you been all night?

38:47.853 --> 38:49.689
- Swimming with the sharks?
- Oh.

38:49.722 --> 38:50.957
Hope you're a good swimmer.

38:50.990 --> 38:52.191
I learned from the best.

38:53.993 --> 38:56.829
So you came to a costume party
dressed as yourself.

38:56.862 --> 39:00.866
This, my friend, is one of the
most important uniforms in history.

39:00.900 --> 39:04.036
If not for us, the world would
be a much different place.

39:04.070 --> 39:07.006
We... we were agents of change.

39:07.039 --> 39:08.975
That's one way of putting it.

39:09.008 --> 39:11.711
We made people
love their servitude

39:11.744 --> 39:18.117
by providing a painless concentration camp,
full of sex, drugs, and rock and roll.

39:18.150 --> 39:19.919
And you are proud of that?

39:19.952 --> 39:22.922
Yeah, I'm proud of my role
in history.

39:23.789 --> 39:26.192
It's not my fault
people are stupid.

39:26.225 --> 39:28.961
It's survival of the fittest
out there, baby.

39:28.995 --> 39:31.030
The fittest or the trickiest?

39:31.731 --> 39:37.103
Why so glum? You're going to be super
famous. You should feel empowered.

39:37.136 --> 39:39.705
I don't feel so empowered.

39:39.739 --> 39:42.108
Don't sound so ungrateful.

39:42.141 --> 39:45.543
You were chosen
to be part of a plan.

39:45.577 --> 39:47.913
Art is very powerful.

39:47.947 --> 39:49.815
Is it art or is it propaganda?

39:49.849 --> 39:53.152
Oh!
Let me let you in on something.

39:53.185 --> 39:55.921
- Do you remember Charles Manson?
- Yes.

39:55.955 --> 39:59.591
Well, he was part of our
social circle in Laurel Canyon.

39:59.624 --> 40:01.827
The Beach Boys
recorded a song he wrote,

40:01.861 --> 40:04.930
I think it was called
"Cease to Exist."

40:04.964 --> 40:09.935
Manson single-handedly destroyed
the anti-war movement overnight.

40:09.969 --> 40:12.171
All that peace and love.

40:12.204 --> 40:17.643
Now, why do you suppose we would have
anything to do with a serial killer?

40:17.676 --> 40:19.311
Like attracts like.

40:19.345 --> 40:21.080
Get smart.

40:21.113 --> 40:22.748
They're on to you.

40:23.349 --> 40:25.818
Why do you care
about the little people?

40:25.851 --> 40:27.119
Because I am one.

40:27.153 --> 40:29.688
They want to be
the beautiful people.

40:29.722 --> 40:31.791
No, they don't.

40:31.824 --> 40:34.760
And the people who think that they
do just don't know the truth yet.

40:35.261 --> 40:37.562
All the world's a stage.

40:38.030 --> 40:40.866
And all the men and women
merely players.

40:40.900 --> 40:44.270
They have their exits
and their entrances.

40:44.303 --> 40:47.873
And one man in his time
plays many parts.

40:50.009 --> 40:54.914
<i>♪ In the pines, in the pines ♪</i>

40:54.947 --> 40:58.918
<i>♪ Where the sun never shines ♪</i>

40:58.951 --> 41:04.657
<i>♪ I'd shiver
When the cold wind blows ♪</i>

41:06.058 --> 41:09.895
<i>♪ There's a grave in the past ♪</i>

41:09.929 --> 41:13.699
<i>♪ Where the sun never shines ♪</i>

41:13.732 --> 41:20.139
<i>♪ There's a grave that's shaded
With pine ♪</i>

41:22.374 --> 41:23.776
Meg.

41:24.977 --> 41:27.880
Do you ever wonder why there
are so many sad stories

41:27.913 --> 41:29.348
about the entertainment
industry?

41:30.049 --> 41:37.022
Um, I don't know,
maybe the fame or the drugs?

41:38.791 --> 41:41.360
See, you're not more
hopelessly enslaved

41:41.393 --> 41:44.163
than those that falsely believe
they are free.

41:44.930 --> 41:50.202
Ah, gird up, minds like that
hardly exist anymore.

41:51.270 --> 41:52.771
So tragic.

41:53.405 --> 41:55.708
One always has a choice.

41:59.178 --> 42:00.713
Ahem.

42:04.316 --> 42:06.685
Do you like the new merch
for Katie's film?

42:09.155 --> 42:13.192
"The Supernatural Secrets
of Big Business Success."

42:15.861 --> 42:16.996
I love it.

42:19.932 --> 42:21.867
It's too bad she didn't die.

42:22.935 --> 42:25.404
Could have sold a lot of merch.

42:27.106 --> 42:28.274
How old are you?

42:28.307 --> 42:31.143
Wait, don't answer that.

43:04.109 --> 43:05.945
Joeboy?

43:08.480 --> 43:11.417
Hey, Joeboy, yo, you here?

43:11.450 --> 43:13.252
Alicia, what's up?

43:13.285 --> 43:15.821
I have some questions
about Katie's accident.

43:15.854 --> 43:16.989
You have a minute?

43:17.423 --> 43:18.991
Sure.

43:20.660 --> 43:25.397
If there's a fatality involved, the car goes
to 11th Street. Is that still the case?

43:25.431 --> 43:28.367
Yeah. Car is there now
at the town impound now.

43:28.400 --> 43:30.936
So we still have the car?
For how long?

43:32.271 --> 43:34.206
Till they're done
with the investigation.

43:34.240 --> 43:37.109
Those, man, could be six
weeks, it could be six years.

43:37.142 --> 43:41.981
So you could get me the
car's GPS information, right?

43:43.249 --> 43:46.485
Uh, I'd have to ask the police
for permission

43:46.518 --> 43:48.821
but, you know,
accident that bad,

43:48.854 --> 43:50.856
they probably already
cut the battery.

43:50.889 --> 43:55.261
Could you check for me, please,
and let me know?

43:57.162 --> 43:58.063
Sure.

43:58.464 --> 44:00.266
Thanks.

44:00.299 --> 44:02.334
Yeah, well,
it's one of the worst I've ever seen.

44:02.368 --> 44:03.469
Yeah, it was really bad.

44:03.502 --> 44:05.838
It's a miracle Katie survived.

44:07.373 --> 44:09.441
I knew that dude
as soon as I got there.

44:10.476 --> 44:12.144
Saw the shooters.

44:13.178 --> 44:14.380
Shooters?

44:15.414 --> 44:16.348
What do you mean?

44:19.118 --> 44:21.153
The one I've ever seen. I've...

44:21.186 --> 44:24.523
People got killed,
was getting knocked out of their shoes.

44:25.391 --> 44:26.292
It's weird.

44:27.926 --> 44:29.194
Yeah.

44:29.228 --> 44:31.196
Never heard of that.
I wonder why.

44:33.098 --> 44:38.304
I mean, like, it's like the soul
gets taken right out of it.

44:42.207 --> 44:44.977
Well, thanks, Joeboy,
I appreciate it.

44:45.477 --> 44:52.117
Sure. Wait, so, I'm sorry,
how are you doing? You okay?

44:54.019 --> 44:57.423
I'm not going to say anything
bad about Hammonton to you.

44:57.456 --> 45:00.259
And that's a good thing. You better not.

45:00.292 --> 45:01.560
And, uh...

45:03.329 --> 45:05.464
And they're not saying anything
bad about our girl, either.

45:05.497 --> 45:07.099
- Okay, Joeboy.
- I'm serious.

45:07.132 --> 45:08.334
Let me know.

45:43.035 --> 45:44.136
Hi, Peter.

45:44.169 --> 45:45.170
Alicia.

45:46.171 --> 45:48.474
Hey, remember this?

45:49.676 --> 45:52.679
Wow. Look at my hair.

45:52.712 --> 45:54.546
That was seventh grade.

45:54.580 --> 45:57.583
I remember that light blue
sparkly sweater.

45:58.718 --> 46:01.920
I don't think my mother kept one
picture of me from middle school.

46:06.458 --> 46:07.993
Thanks for meeting me here.

46:09.428 --> 46:11.463
I try and stop by every day.

46:11.497 --> 46:13.565
It's beautiful back here.

46:13.599 --> 46:15.401
It's Katie's favorite place
on Earth.

46:17.202 --> 46:18.570
We had a great summer here.

46:19.571 --> 46:20.906
Just, um...

46:22.441 --> 46:23.942
I just closed the pool.

46:25.611 --> 46:30.149
I can't imagine how difficult this is for
you and your family. You're all so close.

46:31.250 --> 46:37.122
Now, Katie has been
pulling away from us for a while.

46:39.057 --> 46:40.159
What happened?

46:41.527 --> 46:44.530
People she surrounded herself
with, they isolated her from us.

46:48.133 --> 46:50.436
World doesn't work
the way we think it does.

46:54.707 --> 46:56.442
Nothing is as it seems.

46:57.409 --> 46:58.977
What does that mean?

47:00.747 --> 47:03.650
Katie was getting, uh,
disillusioned with Hollywood.

47:03.683 --> 47:05.317
She told me she wanted
to quit acting

47:05.350 --> 47:06.985
and go back to the...
back to school.

47:07.019 --> 47:09.188
Did she say why?

47:09.221 --> 47:13.125
Well, I pressed her at one point and
she said the less I know the better.

47:14.694 --> 47:17.062
Everything is a big secret
with Katie.

47:17.463 --> 47:18.665
I don't understand.

47:19.766 --> 47:22.267
Why quit now when she's about
to become a huge star?

47:22.301 --> 47:24.102
How do you walk away from that?

47:24.704 --> 47:25.705
Maybe you don't.

47:29.041 --> 47:30.677
Everything comes at a price.

47:37.316 --> 47:40.319
Was Katie getting involved
with the wrong types of people?

47:40.720 --> 47:42.054
You could say that.

47:45.991 --> 47:46.826
Right after Katie was admitted
to the hospital,

47:46.860 --> 47:48.728
I kept having
these strange feelings,

47:48.761 --> 47:52.197
my intuition, I guess,
that she wasn't safe.

47:53.499 --> 47:55.400
And then one day,
I pulled up in her driveway

47:55.434 --> 47:57.236
and caught someone
breaking into the house.

47:57.269 --> 47:58.604
The window had already
been smashed.

47:58.638 --> 47:59.639
Are you kidding?

47:59.672 --> 48:00.707
No.

48:02.074 --> 48:03.676
Had cameras installed
the next day

48:03.710 --> 48:06.078
and I had the police helping me
keep an eye on the place.

48:06.111 --> 48:07.714
What do you think
they were looking for?

48:09.682 --> 48:10.616
Peter?

48:11.550 --> 48:13.218
What do you think
they were looking for?

48:17.222 --> 48:18.791
I think
they were looking for this.

48:18.825 --> 48:20.158
What is it?

48:21.326 --> 48:23.128
- Katie's diary.
- Can I see?

48:23.161 --> 48:24.664
Yeah. I want you to read it.

48:25.632 --> 48:28.267
It'll give you an idea
what my daughter's up against.

48:29.636 --> 48:33.138
In her last entry, she wrote
about going to see a Violet.

48:33.806 --> 48:35.107
Yeah.

48:36.241 --> 48:38.443
Violet reached out to me
right after Katie's accident.

48:38.477 --> 48:41.480
She was the one who told me to
collect all of Katie's personal things

48:41.513 --> 48:45.384
that might be lying around the
house, especially the diary.

48:45.417 --> 48:49.121
Thank God I got here in time.
I mean, without that, we have nothing.

48:51.189 --> 48:53.525
Katie's memory
might not be the same.

48:53.559 --> 48:55.093
Don't say that.

48:55.127 --> 48:57.195
We don't know.
The doctors don't know.

48:57.563 --> 49:00.767
That's all we've got right now.
That, and Violet.

49:00.800 --> 49:02.167
Who's Violet?

49:03.302 --> 49:04.637
It's not a real name.
She doesn't go by her real name.

49:04.671 --> 49:09.441
Apparently, she's a child actress
and she's pretty well-known.

49:09.474 --> 49:10.743
Can I talk to her?

49:14.146 --> 49:18.818
Alicia, as a friend,
as Katie's friend,

49:19.852 --> 49:23.723
you have to understand what you're
getting into before you go any further.

49:25.758 --> 49:27.760
This, this goes deep.

49:27.794 --> 49:31.196
I mean,
deeper than you can imagine it.

49:32.197 --> 49:35.233
If you write that article,
you could be in the same danger as Katie.

49:36.401 --> 49:38.136
What else did Violet say?

49:42.174 --> 49:43.475
Things I'll never get over.

49:44.744 --> 49:46.445
Things I can't repeat.

49:48.347 --> 49:50.750
Children, abuse, torture.

49:52.250 --> 49:53.619
If you knew the truth,
I mean, I...

49:54.586 --> 49:58.256
How the power structure really
works, you wouldn't be able to sleep.

49:58.290 --> 50:02.729
I mean, these are people you know in...
in the movies, in TV, politicians,

50:02.762 --> 50:04.196
people I once admired.

50:04.931 --> 50:06.733
Is Violet willing to talk to me?

50:06.766 --> 50:10.268
Yes. She... might
be risking her life in doing so.

50:10.302 --> 50:12.739
I understand. Can you give
me her contact information?

50:12.772 --> 50:14.406
She'll contact you.

50:15.574 --> 50:18.510
Please, Alicia,
she has to be able to trust you.

50:18.543 --> 50:20.612
Both of us have to be
able to trust you.

50:20.647 --> 50:24.717
You know you can trust me
but she has to reach out soon.

50:24.751 --> 50:26.485
My boss is getting frustrated.

50:26.518 --> 50:27.820
I can arrange that.

50:29.656 --> 50:32.659
Are you okay?
You seem frightened.

50:34.827 --> 50:36.228
Katie needs our help.

50:36.829 --> 50:38.731
And we need you, Alicia.

50:40.432 --> 50:43.903
By getting the whole story out in a... in
the legitimate media outlet, she's safer.

50:43.936 --> 50:45.772
We all are.

50:45.805 --> 50:47.372
I mean, even if it's our own
little small-town newspaper.

50:47.406 --> 50:48.975
Nothing small anymore
with the internet.

50:49.008 --> 50:50.643
And that's what we're hoping
is true,

50:50.677 --> 50:52.444
because we want the story
to go viral.

50:52.477 --> 50:53.846
That is our goal.

50:54.914 --> 50:57.282
Violet says she can help
make that happen.

50:58.550 --> 51:01.721
Wow, okay. I just need
to get my head around this

51:02.689 --> 51:05.892
because until now,
I wasn't sure what Katie's story would be.

51:06.759 --> 51:10.697
Once I read the diary and talk to
Violet, I'll get in touch with you.

51:12.031 --> 51:16.669
Peter, thank you for coming to me first.
I won't let you down.

51:18.905 --> 51:20.907
Okay, I gotta...
I gotta get going.

51:20.940 --> 51:23.308
I gotta get back
to the hospital.

51:23.341 --> 51:26.813
Katie doesn't know how lucky she is
to have such a supportive family.

51:27.446 --> 51:29.816
That is the biggest advantage
in life.

51:32.617 --> 51:33.820
She knows.

51:35.655 --> 51:36.889
Thank you, Alicia.

51:40.059 --> 51:41.661
Friendship is sacred.

52:01.080 --> 52:02.614
What are you doing?

52:02.648 --> 52:04.483
Waiting for Rusty.
What are you doing?

52:04.516 --> 52:06.451
I've come to give Rusty
my notes.

52:06.485 --> 52:07.820
I'll make sure he gets them.

52:07.854 --> 52:09.254
I'll wait.

52:12.557 --> 52:15.627
How's the story on the
commemorative blanket going?

52:16.328 --> 52:17.964
Great. How's your story going?

52:17.997 --> 52:20.398
Great.
I think I'm onto something big.

52:20.432 --> 52:21.834
Yeah, that's good.

52:22.702 --> 52:24.070
- Hello.
- Hi, Rusty.

52:24.103 --> 52:27.506
Hi, Rusty.
I just got a huge lead today.

52:28.841 --> 52:31.343
Giana, can you come back
in about 15 minutes?

52:31.376 --> 52:34.046
That's fine. I just wanted to give
you my report in the chamber meeting.

52:34.080 --> 52:35.047
Let me know what you think.

52:35.081 --> 52:36.481
Thanks. I will.

52:37.083 --> 52:38.785
Bye, Giana.

52:40.720 --> 52:41.888
What's that?

52:41.921 --> 52:43.488
Katie's diary.

52:43.522 --> 52:45.091
- Oh, where did you get it?
- Katie's dad.

52:45.124 --> 52:46.424
Anything interesting?

52:46.458 --> 52:48.728
Uh, yeah, to say the least.

52:48.761 --> 52:51.097
- What does Peter think?
- About what?

52:52.698 --> 52:54.667
About the diary.
Why did he give it to you?

52:54.700 --> 52:56.736
He wants me to read it and
see if I can find anything new

52:56.769 --> 52:58.503
that might shed some light
on things.

52:58.537 --> 53:00.539
And did you find anything new?

53:00.572 --> 53:02.842
The name Violet
keeps popping up.

53:02.875 --> 53:04.777
I'm thinking about following up.
What do you think?

53:05.410 --> 53:07.345
What do I think?

53:08.580 --> 53:09.749
I don't know what I think.

53:11.918 --> 53:15.855
You even notice that Katie's
accident isn't in news anymore?

53:15.888 --> 53:19.324
Yeah. So it's just
the news cycles have changed.

53:20.092 --> 53:23.428
Like you may have turned me
into a conspiracy theorist.

53:23.461 --> 53:25.932
Facts are facts.
You taught me that.

53:32.638 --> 53:34.406
We're spending way too much time
thinking about this story.

53:35.942 --> 53:38.845
Got a lot of other work to do.
And so do you. I want you to wrap this up.

53:38.878 --> 53:41.881
I just need a little bit more time
so I can follow up with Violet.

53:41.914 --> 53:43.515
Are you having second thoughts?

53:43.548 --> 53:46.585
I just... I want to proceed
with caution.

53:48.721 --> 53:50.756
What do you mean?

53:50.790 --> 53:53.726
I mean, that I have a responsibility
to everyone who works here.

53:54.160 --> 53:55.862
I understand your concern.

53:56.595 --> 54:00.166
I wrote about drug gangs in
Philadelphia and it was scary,

54:00.199 --> 54:01.901
but I was doing my job.

54:01.934 --> 54:04.971
That's what journalists do.
We tell the truth.

54:05.004 --> 54:07.472
I really think Violet
is the missing link.

54:07.505 --> 54:10.076
All right,
let's talk about this later. Okay?

54:10.609 --> 54:11.911
I have to return a call.

54:44.677 --> 54:46.812
Do you know what you do?

54:46.846 --> 54:47.914
I don't know what you mean.

54:48.981 --> 54:51.784
Oh, what a wonderful
little actress you are.

54:51.817 --> 54:53.518
I don't act in real life.

54:53.551 --> 54:55.755
That would make me
a psychopath, not an actress.

54:55.788 --> 54:57.723
What is it that you hope
to gain?

54:57.757 --> 54:58.925
My freedom.

54:58.958 --> 55:01.459
Mm, not possible.

55:01.493 --> 55:05.497
I have a modicum of self-respect
left and I am leaving with it.

55:05.530 --> 55:07.099
I will keep my word.

55:07.133 --> 55:09.601
I will promote this film.

55:09.635 --> 55:11.671
I will keep my mouth shut.

55:12.204 --> 55:14.472
Please, Lilith, let me go.

55:14.506 --> 55:16.175
You know I can't do that.

55:17.176 --> 55:19.111
I answer to a higher power.

55:19.145 --> 55:20.545
What does that mean?

55:21.147 --> 55:24.784
It means we own your influence.

55:25.617 --> 55:27.053
There's no going back.

55:28.754 --> 55:31.190
Do you know that power
we gave you?

55:32.091 --> 55:33.625
We own that power.

55:34.126 --> 55:35.861
- Ah...
- Oh.

55:36.796 --> 55:39.531
You said the magic words, Katie.

55:39.865 --> 55:44.136
You said you were willing
to do anything.

55:44.870 --> 55:46.238
I was wrong.

55:46.272 --> 55:48.941
This anxiety you're feeling,
Katie,

55:48.975 --> 55:54.512
is just the end of your old life
and the beginning of your new one.

55:55.081 --> 55:59.251
And all that excitement can feel like
nerves. I've seen it a thousand times.

56:01.153 --> 56:02.254
Take a rest.

56:03.222 --> 56:05.992
I'm going to have my personal
driver take you home.

56:06.993 --> 56:09.962
And then you can call me next week
when you get back to New York.

56:10.963 --> 56:13.165
We'll decide
on everything together.

56:14.100 --> 56:17.036
The premiere, the gown,

56:18.037 --> 56:22.708
the magazine covers,
it's all here.

56:23.709 --> 56:25.845
Everything you ever wished for.

56:28.147 --> 56:32.018
You take a rest
and clear your head.

56:33.753 --> 56:35.254
How does that sound?

56:36.255 --> 56:39.591
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I just need a break.

56:39.624 --> 56:41.593
And a good night's sleep.

56:43.696 --> 56:44.764
Goodbye, Katie.

57:31.143 --> 57:32.978
You're a lot taller
in real life.

57:33.012 --> 57:33.913
What the hell?

57:34.880 --> 57:36.015
Do I know you?

57:36.982 --> 57:38.350
I don't know.

57:38.384 --> 57:39.785
Why are you here?

57:41.087 --> 57:42.922
- I want to ask you something.
- What?

57:44.223 --> 57:46.959
I want to ask you
what you hope to accomplish

57:46.992 --> 57:50.796
by writing that ridiculous
article about Katie's accident.

57:50.830 --> 57:54.133
- Finding the truth.
- The truth?

57:55.101 --> 57:57.736
You don't even tell yourself
the truth.

57:57.770 --> 57:59.305
What's that supposed to mean?

57:59.338 --> 58:02.141
Raised by a single mom.

58:03.275 --> 58:04.944
She pretty much ignored you.

58:06.112 --> 58:08.047
Never told you
who your real father was.

58:09.782 --> 58:13.285
You've been lying to yourself
from a very young age, Alicia.

58:13.319 --> 58:14.787
What are you saying?

58:15.354 --> 58:18.858
However, your work ethic,
it impresses me.

58:20.192 --> 58:22.761
It's what got you
to the Philadelphia Drum.

58:22.795 --> 58:25.998
You met a nice man.
You got married.

58:27.032 --> 58:29.768
Then you resented him once you
found out that you're pregnant.

58:30.402 --> 58:31.403
Miscarriage.

58:32.238 --> 58:33.772
That's the official story.

58:34.907 --> 58:36.342
Started sleeping with your boss.

58:37.476 --> 58:38.811
Your husband moved.

58:40.446 --> 58:43.282
Things didn't work out
with the boss. They never do.

58:44.150 --> 58:47.453
And just like that,
all of it was gone.

58:47.486 --> 58:48.521
Get out.

58:49.722 --> 58:52.691
You begged for your job back
at the Hammonton Herald.

58:54.193 --> 58:57.930
Rusty, he was nice enough
to give you the job.

58:57.963 --> 58:59.999
A second chance.

59:00.032 --> 59:02.067
You know it's funny,

59:02.101 --> 59:04.436
life has a certain way of nudging
us back to where we belong.

59:05.204 --> 59:07.206
So why don't you want me
to write the article?

59:07.239 --> 59:09.275
I don't think it's going
to make a difference.

59:09.308 --> 59:11.010
Then why are you here?

59:12.144 --> 59:17.316
Well, think twice before you
cast pearls before swine.

59:19.051 --> 59:22.121
We have them so confused,

59:22.154 --> 59:25.124
that if I were to tell them
that snow is black,

59:26.358 --> 59:29.795
they would believe
that snow is black.

59:30.296 --> 59:31.764
Who do you work for?

59:31.797 --> 59:34.466
Call it a Think Tank.

59:34.500 --> 59:36.268
I don't believe
this is happening.

59:37.002 --> 59:39.438
Your belief is not required
to make it true.

59:40.272 --> 59:42.775
You're not stupid,
are you, Alicia?

59:43.909 --> 59:46.078
You just can't fathom
the enormity of it all.

59:46.111 --> 59:47.313
What do you mean?

59:50.549 --> 59:53.719
Hm, well, that's nice.

59:55.421 --> 59:59.491
A little relic from your stint
in Alcoholics Anonymous.

59:59.525 --> 01:00:02.161
My grandfather gave it to me.

01:00:02.194 --> 01:00:05.931
You have family with something
so valuable to pass along to you?

01:00:06.999 --> 01:00:08.500
Perhaps they're not all wolves.

01:00:08.534 --> 01:00:11.136
No. Some of us are fighters.

01:00:15.074 --> 01:00:19.979
I do like seeing Jesus nailed to
the cross like that. I really do.

01:00:21.313 --> 01:00:24.783
I think one of those should be in
every Christian home, don't you?

01:00:24.817 --> 01:00:31.090
One should be reminded daily of what happens
to the truth and the light on this planet.

01:00:32.825 --> 01:00:34.393
Who sent you?

01:00:34.426 --> 01:00:36.161
Um,
if you don't know your enemy,

01:00:36.195 --> 01:00:41.333
Sun Tzu says,
you should not engage in battle.

01:00:43.135 --> 01:00:45.938
I think that's the problem
with the world, don't you?

01:00:45.971 --> 01:00:47.039
What's that?

01:00:49.241 --> 01:00:50.442
People...

01:00:52.511 --> 01:00:56.282
don't read.

01:01:18.404 --> 01:01:20.439
Alicia.

01:01:20.873 --> 01:01:22.341
Are you okay?

01:01:22.374 --> 01:01:24.343
I think so.

01:01:24.376 --> 01:01:27.579
I had to call you. I'm sorry,
I didn't get dressed.

01:01:27.613 --> 01:01:30.282
Someone doesn't want us
to write this story.

01:01:30.316 --> 01:01:32.051
Did he try to hurt you?

01:01:32.084 --> 01:01:34.486
No, but he broke into my house
when I was in a shower.

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.255
Did he threaten you?

01:01:36.288 --> 01:01:38.190
Not in a direct way.

01:01:38.223 --> 01:01:39.625
Jesus.

01:01:39.659 --> 01:01:41.860
I think we should get
the police involved.

01:01:41.894 --> 01:01:45.064
No. Why? He's not going to stop
us from writing this story.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.904
I'm not worried about the story.

01:01:54.973 --> 01:01:56.375
It's Katie's people.

01:01:57.009 --> 01:01:59.511
They are just trying
to control the narrative.

01:02:03.215 --> 01:02:05.050
Yeah, you sure about that?

01:02:05.084 --> 01:02:07.019
I have something
I want to talk to you about.

01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:11.490
I'll be right back. Just...
In the bedroom.

01:02:18.597 --> 01:02:22.134
I know you have reservations
about reaching out to Violet.

01:02:22.167 --> 01:02:25.104
But after tonight,
it just makes sense.

01:02:25.672 --> 01:02:27.906
- Really?
- Yes.

01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:32.211
Joeboy called me today. He couldn't
get the GPS. We're at a big dead end.

01:02:32.244 --> 01:02:34.413
This is all we've got.

01:02:34.446 --> 01:02:36.915
That guy said I needed
to know my enemy.

01:02:36.949 --> 01:02:39.385
And maybe we need
to look into this.

01:02:39.418 --> 01:02:40.986
- He said that?
- Yes.

01:02:41.019 --> 01:02:42.187
Come on.

01:02:42.621 --> 01:02:43.956
What do you think?

01:02:45.524 --> 01:02:50.162
I think everyone is actually safer if
I write this story, put it out there.

01:02:50.195 --> 01:02:52.097
Even Peter says so.

01:02:56.736 --> 01:02:57.936
All right.

01:02:58.937 --> 01:03:01.240
Call her. Just promise me,
you won't meet her

01:03:01.273 --> 01:03:02.675
or anyone else by yourself.

01:03:02.709 --> 01:03:04.009
I promise.

01:03:05.244 --> 01:03:07.146
Are you sure you don't want me
to get the police involved?

01:03:07.179 --> 01:03:08.514
I'm sure.

01:03:08.547 --> 01:03:10.249
What's wrong?

01:03:10.282 --> 01:03:13.619
I just... I don't have
a good feeling about this.

01:03:15.187 --> 01:03:16.422
Let's have a glass of wine.

01:03:17.589 --> 01:03:22.261
It's been such a crazy week.
Let's just talk about it.

01:03:25.297 --> 01:03:26.965
I should go.

01:03:26.999 --> 01:03:28.333
- You sure?
- Yeah.

01:03:28.768 --> 01:03:30.469
Call me later
if you talk to Violet.

01:03:30.502 --> 01:03:32.104
I wanna know what she says.

01:03:32.137 --> 01:03:36.643
Rusty, stay with me.
Have a glass of wine.

01:03:43.015 --> 01:03:44.116
I can't.

01:03:45.384 --> 01:03:49.588
I am... I got a lot of work
to catch up on, you know, and...

01:03:52.458 --> 01:03:55.327
I mean, this thing is just...

01:03:56.528 --> 01:03:58.564
it's just so troubling.

01:03:58.597 --> 01:04:00.265
And I've never had to deal with
anything like this before and...

01:04:05.170 --> 01:04:06.639
I don't know how to help you.

01:04:09.676 --> 01:04:12.444
I'll be home all night.
Call me if you need anything.

01:04:13.813 --> 01:04:15.013
Yeah.

01:04:16.348 --> 01:04:17.483
Thanks for coming.

01:05:11.570 --> 01:05:13.238
- Violet?
- Yeah.

01:05:13.272 --> 01:05:14.674
Hi, I'm Alicia.

01:05:14.707 --> 01:05:15.742
Hey.

01:05:16.643 --> 01:05:18.477
- Are you here alone?
- Yes.

01:05:21.513 --> 01:05:23.048
Do you live here?

01:05:45.872 --> 01:05:49.241
- So, you wanna ask some questions about Katie Marro?
- Yes.

01:05:49.274 --> 01:05:50.609
- And you're a journalist?
- Yes.

01:05:50.643 --> 01:05:52.244
Can I see some credentials?

01:05:57.549 --> 01:05:59.451
- Hammonton Herald.
- Yes.

01:05:59.484 --> 01:06:01.186
I also worked
for the Philly Drum.

01:06:01.219 --> 01:06:02.855
I was an investigative reporter.

01:06:02.889 --> 01:06:05.123
Okay.

01:06:07.359 --> 01:06:08.661
What do you wanna know?

01:06:08.895 --> 01:06:11.597
Why your name
is all over Katie's diary?

01:06:14.834 --> 01:06:16.134
We were friends.

01:06:17.235 --> 01:06:18.071
How do you know her?

01:06:19.639 --> 01:06:21.874
We met at a party
at Ceiling Mansion.

01:06:25.243 --> 01:06:27.412
She mentions that place
in her diary.

01:06:28.313 --> 01:06:31.918
Katie and I were required
to attend certain mixers there.

01:06:31.951 --> 01:06:33.352
Why?

01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:36.488
It's very hard to get anywhere
in the entertainment industry

01:06:36.521 --> 01:06:38.357
if you don't attend
those parties.

01:06:38.825 --> 01:06:39.826
I don't understand.

01:06:42.394 --> 01:06:44.529
If you want the fame,
you have to play the game.

01:06:45.397 --> 01:06:49.836
It's all about owning influence, and you can't
be owned unless you've been compromised.

01:06:49.869 --> 01:06:51.169
Compromised?

01:06:51.638 --> 01:06:52.639
Yes.

01:06:53.873 --> 01:06:55.607
People who arranged
these parties,

01:06:55.642 --> 01:06:57.609
they know exactly
what they're doing.

01:06:58.510 --> 01:07:00.412
What about those
who attend them?

01:07:01.279 --> 01:07:04.616
I would say everybody knows
and everybody is complicit.

01:07:07.252 --> 01:07:10.923
How does General Black
fit into all this?

01:07:12.692 --> 01:07:15.594
Certain intelligence
agencies work very closely

01:07:15.627 --> 01:07:18.263
with some people
in the entertainment industry.

01:07:19.264 --> 01:07:21.600
Certain projects.
It's propaganda.

01:07:22.835 --> 01:07:24.937
Molding public opinion.

01:07:26.304 --> 01:07:31.510
It's all about controlling the
public's perception of reality.

01:07:32.011 --> 01:07:34.479
So why would he put it all
out there in his books?

01:07:35.748 --> 01:07:37.516
Don't even try
to hide it anymore.

01:07:39.118 --> 01:07:44.589
General Black is also responsible for
blackmailing a lot of the entertainers.

01:07:44.623 --> 01:07:47.860
Why go through all that trouble
to compromise entertainers?

01:07:47.894 --> 01:07:51.664
The entertainment industry has a lot
of influence over people.

01:07:51.698 --> 01:07:53.666
It's like a spell.
Think about it.

01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:55.902
Ask yourself this question

01:07:55.935 --> 01:08:00.505
because so many people be so in line on
so many issues, statistically speaking.

01:08:00.907 --> 01:08:06.278
They certainly push an agenda but no
one with a job takes them seriously.

01:08:08.715 --> 01:08:10.248
You sure about that?

01:08:11.718 --> 01:08:14.386
How is Jon De Bauer involved?

01:08:16.656 --> 01:08:18.758
His family owned
Ceiling Mansion.

01:08:19.491 --> 01:08:21.961
That's where Katie was
on the night of the accident.

01:08:22.627 --> 01:08:24.496
Where is Ceiling Mansion
located?

01:08:24.529 --> 01:08:28.567
Cossart Avenue,
near Pennsylvania-Delaware border,

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:31.502
where the trees grow away
from the Sun.

01:08:36.475 --> 01:08:41.647
The De Bauer family also owns an
island in the Car... in the Caribbean.

01:08:42.682 --> 01:08:45.718
It's where most
of the blackmailing takes place.

01:08:47.486 --> 01:08:49.689
Presidents have been
to that island.

01:08:49.721 --> 01:08:51.389
Sick what goes on there.

01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:53.926
Has Katie been compromised?

01:08:54.993 --> 01:08:56.028
Yeah.

01:08:58.462 --> 01:09:01.801
There was also a man
named Henry Lee Lucas.

01:09:03.035 --> 01:09:05.303
Yeah, I know Lucas.

01:09:06.371 --> 01:09:07.974
He used to hang out
at the mansion.

01:09:08.808 --> 01:09:11.644
Do you think Lucas
was in that car to hurt Katie?

01:09:12.645 --> 01:09:14.578
I think he was there
to kill Katie.

01:09:16.015 --> 01:09:19.786
You can't just walk away when you're
about to be handed that much fame.

01:09:19.819 --> 01:09:21.854
So Katie wanted out?

01:09:21.888 --> 01:09:25.524
And the powers that rule over
that industry wouldn't allow it?

01:09:25.557 --> 01:09:26.959
Exactly.

01:09:26.993 --> 01:09:28.995
And they were gonna make
an example out of her.

01:09:29.028 --> 01:09:30.395
What about you?

01:09:31.731 --> 01:09:32.965
What about me?

01:09:32.999 --> 01:09:35.433
Did you walk away?

01:09:39.906 --> 01:09:43.375
I was a child in this business.

01:09:44.442 --> 01:09:46.078
No business for a child.

01:09:47.379 --> 01:09:49.715
And I held up my end
of the bargain until now.

01:09:50.683 --> 01:09:52.084
I'm not afraid anymore.

01:09:53.019 --> 01:09:54.987
What's the end game?

01:09:55.021 --> 01:09:58.758
With the entertainment industry
working with intelligence agencies

01:09:58.791 --> 01:10:01.359
pushing a certain agenda
for what?

01:10:01.393 --> 01:10:02.594
You're living it.

01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:06.866
These people serve dark state.
They've sold their souls to it.

01:10:06.899 --> 01:10:08.768
Dark state?

01:10:08.801 --> 01:10:12.638
Where they will reign in hell
rather than serve in heaven.

01:10:12.672 --> 01:10:14.006
What does that mean?

01:10:15.607 --> 01:10:21.379
They want a one world government run by
global elites and unelected bureaucrats.

01:10:21.948 --> 01:10:25.751
They're currently depopulating to
make it all a bit more manageable.

01:10:25.785 --> 01:10:27.987
Goodbye, America.
Goodbye, freedom.

01:10:29.121 --> 01:10:30.890
These people believe in slavery.

01:10:30.923 --> 01:10:33.358
Oh, I feel like Americans
wouldn't let that happen.

01:10:34.193 --> 01:10:35.728
They already have.

01:10:40.498 --> 01:10:41.834
Why speak out now?

01:10:44.203 --> 01:10:46.571
Dark state is about to make
its move.

01:10:49.075 --> 01:10:51.110
The moment of truth is now

01:10:51.143 --> 01:10:53.813
and every single one of us is
gonna have to make a decision.

01:10:54.914 --> 01:11:00.418
You can choose to be in service to others or
you can choose to be in service to yourself.

01:11:01.153 --> 01:11:02.621
Light versus dark.

01:11:03.222 --> 01:11:04.724
Game on.

01:11:04.757 --> 01:11:06.759
Are you doing this
because of Katie?

01:11:12.865 --> 01:11:14.000
You should go.

01:11:17.003 --> 01:11:18.938
You have the information
you need.

01:11:20.572 --> 01:11:23.709
So go write your story
if you have the guts.

01:11:23.743 --> 01:11:27.213
Aren't you afraid?
Living out here all alone?

01:11:27.246 --> 01:11:32.184
If dark state is as powerful as you
say they are, why speak out now?

01:11:33.485 --> 01:11:35.453
Nobody gets out of here alive.

01:11:48.701 --> 01:11:50.736
Thanks for taking the ride
with me.

01:11:50.770 --> 01:11:51.971
Told you I would.

01:11:52.972 --> 01:11:55.473
- So Violet confirmed the address?
- Yes.

01:11:55.507 --> 01:11:57.509
According to her,

01:11:57.542 --> 01:11:59.845
Katie and the boys were at a
house party on Cossart Avenue

01:11:59.879 --> 01:12:01.747
at Pennsylvania-Delaware border.

01:12:01.781 --> 01:12:03.515
And guess who owns the house?

01:12:03.816 --> 01:12:05.851
- Who?
- The De Bauer family.

01:12:06.719 --> 01:12:09.021
That's right. From Delaware.

01:12:09.989 --> 01:12:12.091
So we're just taking a ride.
No knocking on doors.

01:12:12.124 --> 01:12:14.226
No way.

01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:16.561
It's owned by the De Bauers,
we won't even be able to get close.

01:12:16.594 --> 01:12:20.866
Probably tons of security.
Just really curious. Aren't you?

01:12:21.533 --> 01:12:24.870
We finally know where Katie was
the night of her accident.

01:12:24.904 --> 01:12:28.641
And it happens to be at a house owned
by the one and only De Bauer family?

01:12:28.674 --> 01:12:30.710
It's only an hour and 13 minutes
from here.

01:12:30.743 --> 01:12:32.144
It's so strange.

01:12:32.979 --> 01:12:34.780
Let's get this over with.

01:12:34.814 --> 01:12:36.115
Tonight, we celebrate.

01:12:37.783 --> 01:12:38.884
Promise?

01:12:41.586 --> 01:12:43.255
- Hm?
- Promise.

01:12:49.996 --> 01:12:51.097
Hold on.

01:12:52.098 --> 01:12:53.632
This is newsworthy.

01:13:59.632 --> 01:14:01.333
Watch out!

01:14:04.837 --> 01:14:06.571
Oh, my God.

01:14:10.042 --> 01:14:11.277
Wait here.

01:14:15.381 --> 01:14:16.849
Hello.

01:14:28.761 --> 01:14:30.129
Hello.

01:14:32.331 --> 01:14:35.134
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy.

01:14:35.167 --> 01:14:36.836
You're on private property.

01:14:36.869 --> 01:14:38.838
- Sir, we're trying to help.
- Shut up.

01:14:45.811 --> 01:14:49.315
Ah! No! No! Ah!

01:14:50.382 --> 01:14:52.985
Ah! Ugh!

01:14:53.018 --> 01:14:54.286
Help!

01:14:59.191 --> 01:15:01.293
No! No!

01:15:02.094 --> 01:15:05.164
Ah! Ah! Ah!

01:15:05.865 --> 01:15:08.234
- I'm not gonna tell you again.
- Don't hurt her.

01:15:09.468 --> 01:15:12.404
Ah! Help!

01:15:13.172 --> 01:15:14.673
Last warning.

01:15:14.707 --> 01:15:15.708
- Don't hurt her!
- Ah!

01:16:04.823 --> 01:16:08.961
So, this is Alicia Gazzara.

01:16:10.429 --> 01:16:12.398
In the flesh and blood.

01:16:13.432 --> 01:16:15.234
Do you know
why I brought you here?

01:16:15.267 --> 01:16:17.403
I brought you here

01:16:17.436 --> 01:16:20.773
because I have a feeling you and
I may be able to work together.

01:16:20.806 --> 01:16:22.041
Doing what?

01:16:23.042 --> 01:16:24.777
What's your superpower?

01:16:25.844 --> 01:16:27.046
I can write.

01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:30.015
Pen is mightier than the sword.

01:16:31.850 --> 01:16:35.120
Alicia, do you know
what a lie suggests?

01:16:36.822 --> 01:16:42.761
It suggests that the person you are lying
to doesn't deserve to know the truth.

01:16:42.795 --> 01:16:43.996
Okay.

01:16:44.797 --> 01:16:48.367
The unwashed masses have
successfully dumbed themselves

01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:51.036
down to the level of beasts.

01:16:51.070 --> 01:16:55.841
And they deserve
every fucking lie we tell them.

01:16:56.242 --> 01:16:58.877
I resent that I breathe
the same air as them.

01:16:59.545 --> 01:17:00.879
True.

01:17:02.982 --> 01:17:05.184
I like you so much, Alicia.

01:17:05.918 --> 01:17:07.853
So I ask you again.

01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:12.791
Why are you here?
And not in that field with Rusty?

01:17:12.825 --> 01:17:15.494
You want me to work for you.

01:17:16.295 --> 01:17:17.496
You might say that.

01:17:18.530 --> 01:17:22.901
The media does more
than inform and entertain.

01:17:22.935 --> 01:17:26.805
It shapes public opinion.
That's real power.

01:17:27.373 --> 01:17:30.042
That's what
our programming does.

01:17:30.075 --> 01:17:34.346
People think
what we tell them to think.

01:17:35.447 --> 01:17:38.217
Why do you think
we need to do that?

01:17:38.250 --> 01:17:39.451
I'm not sure.

01:17:40.687 --> 01:17:45.824
No person with a strong
moral compass seeking truth

01:17:45.858 --> 01:17:47.192
can be brainwashed.

01:17:48.093 --> 01:17:52.564
So, we take responsibility
for those who refuse

01:17:52.598 --> 01:17:55.000
to take responsibility
for themselves.

01:17:55.601 --> 01:17:58.270
The unwashed masses.

01:17:58.304 --> 01:18:03.175
It is their collective and willful
ignorance that is enslaving humanity.

01:18:03.208 --> 01:18:05.177
Not a few people at the top.

01:18:05.210 --> 01:18:06.412
I agree.

01:18:06.445 --> 01:18:08.247
Will you help us?

01:18:10.482 --> 01:18:11.550
What would I get?

01:18:12.351 --> 01:18:15.587
Then I ask you.
What do you want?

01:18:17.589 --> 01:18:19.958
What are your deepest desires?

01:18:19.992 --> 01:18:21.593
Let me ask you this.

01:18:23.028 --> 01:18:24.263
Where are we?

01:18:26.498 --> 01:18:29.501
When the Lightbringer
was cast out of heaven

01:18:29.535 --> 01:18:33.906
for refusing to serve mankind,
where did he fall?

01:18:34.306 --> 01:18:35.307
Earth.

01:18:35.974 --> 01:18:38.110
Now, I ask you,

01:18:39.545 --> 01:18:43.382
where are we? Who do we serve?

01:18:45.150 --> 01:18:50.456
Alicia, I am giving you an opportunity to
align yourself with the God of this world.

01:18:50.489 --> 01:18:55.994
And if you do, you will have
anything you've ever wanted.

01:18:57.629 --> 01:18:59.365
What do you want?

01:19:00.332 --> 01:19:02.401
You have to say it, Alicia.

01:19:06.405 --> 01:19:11.577
I want a career as a top writer in the
most prestigious magazine in New York City.

01:19:11.610 --> 01:19:16.215
I want everything Katie had and more, the
parties, the fame, the access, I want it all.

01:19:16.248 --> 01:19:19.551
I want to be rich
and I want respect.

01:19:20.185 --> 01:19:22.187
I worked hard to get where I am.

01:19:22.689 --> 01:19:26.659
I want the respect my family never gave me.
That's what I want, respect.

01:19:27.359 --> 01:19:28.494
Mm.

01:19:29.528 --> 01:19:30.963
And what would you be willing
to do to get it?

01:19:30.996 --> 01:19:32.030
Anything.

01:19:34.133 --> 01:19:35.067
Say it.

01:19:36.068 --> 01:19:38.036
I'm willing to do anything.

01:19:40.072 --> 01:19:41.440
It's all I needed to hear.

01:19:41.473 --> 01:19:44.143
I'll make a few phone calls
on your behalf.

01:19:45.010 --> 01:19:46.145
Thank you.

01:19:47.546 --> 01:19:49.047
What about Rusty?

01:19:49.081 --> 01:19:50.482
Oh, that's all taken care of.

01:19:51.250 --> 01:19:52.451
I'll be in touch.

01:19:55.487 --> 01:19:57.322
Shall I take her on the tour?

01:19:57.990 --> 01:19:59.191
Absolutely.

01:20:16.643 --> 01:20:19.679
Free will is a beautiful thing.

01:20:52.110 --> 01:20:53.345
What?

01:20:54.613 --> 01:20:56.181
Alicia, help.

01:20:58.450 --> 01:20:59.686
Help me.

01:21:03.589 --> 01:21:04.691
I'm hurt badly.

01:21:08.260 --> 01:21:09.294
I can't.

01:21:23.075 --> 01:21:24.777
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:21:24.811 --> 01:21:28.046
Rusty is still alive.
Check his phone.

01:23:02.507 --> 01:23:05.177
Ladies.

01:23:07.914 --> 01:23:12.217
Wow! This house is so beautiful.
Uh, who exactly owns it?

01:23:13.285 --> 01:23:16.588
I don't know, but I was given
free rein all weekend.

01:23:16.622 --> 01:23:18.891
This is amazing.
Look at this view.

01:23:18.925 --> 01:23:20.425
Oh, toast.

01:23:20.459 --> 01:23:21.360
Ah!

01:23:21.393 --> 01:23:22.862
To Alicia.

01:23:22.895 --> 01:23:25.765
Congratulations on a new job
at Hudson Magazine

01:23:25.798 --> 01:23:29.702
and to your first interview on
location at the Cannes Film Festival.

01:23:30.502 --> 01:23:33.305
And to you being given this
house for the weekend to party in

01:23:33.338 --> 01:23:34.841
and inviting us
to celebrate with you.

01:23:34.874 --> 01:23:36.709
Cheers!

01:23:36.743 --> 01:23:38.210
You sure know
how to make a comeback.

01:23:38.243 --> 01:23:41.213
New York City
and the French Riviera.

01:23:41.246 --> 01:23:44.249
- Oh, this is good champagne.
- Oh, it is good.

01:23:44.282 --> 01:23:45.918
Drink up. There's more
where that came from.

01:23:45.952 --> 01:23:47.954
True story, the bar is stocked.

01:23:47.987 --> 01:23:50.322
The good life.

01:23:50.355 --> 01:23:52.925
Who would have thought, just a few
months ago you would be the big star

01:23:52.959 --> 01:23:54.794
coming out of town?

01:23:54.827 --> 01:23:57.629
I was working on some things.
I just never mentioned it.

01:23:57.664 --> 01:23:59.832
Hm, everybody is talking
about you.

01:23:59.866 --> 01:24:03.803
Yesterday, I heard you were the new
editor-in-chief at Catwalk magazine.

01:24:03.836 --> 01:24:07.439
You know Hammonton,
what they don't know, they make up.

01:24:08.507 --> 01:24:10.743
Rusty would be so proud.

01:24:13.412 --> 01:24:15.313
I can't believe
they found the carjacker.

01:24:15.347 --> 01:24:16.949
Yeah, it's about time.

01:24:16.983 --> 01:24:19.384
Hey, have any of you
read Katie's tweets lately?

01:24:19.418 --> 01:24:21.486
Crazy. Literally.

01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:22.989
Honestly, what do you think
is going on with her?

01:24:23.022 --> 01:24:24.489
Brain damage.

01:24:24.523 --> 01:24:26.291
- Lisa.
- I'm not the only one saying it.

01:24:26.893 --> 01:24:28.427
I talked to her
after the accident.

01:24:28.460 --> 01:24:30.395
- She seems fine.
- Okay.

01:24:30.429 --> 01:24:31.931
But her tweets are creepy.

01:24:31.964 --> 01:24:33.900
And she wasn't like that
before the accident.

01:24:33.933 --> 01:24:35.768
Head injuries are serious.

01:24:35.802 --> 01:24:37.704
Could a head injury change
her personality like that?

01:24:37.737 --> 01:24:38.838
It's possible.

01:24:38.871 --> 01:24:40.338
I heard she's back on drugs.

01:24:40.372 --> 01:24:41.841
I don't believe that.

01:24:41.874 --> 01:24:45.011
I never believed Katie did drugs
and I never will.

01:24:45.044 --> 01:24:47.446
Yeah, she drank.

01:24:47.479 --> 01:24:50.783
But every time I see her, she's jogging
around town completely clear-eyed.

01:24:50.817 --> 01:24:52.952
And then I read
that she's back in rehab,

01:24:52.985 --> 01:24:55.855
which is totally untrue because she is
sitting right next to me at Casciano's.

01:24:56.656 --> 01:24:58.256
I don't know how the media
gets away with that.

01:24:58.691 --> 01:25:02.394
Oh, here we go.
She has a whole bunch of tweets.

01:25:03.595 --> 01:25:08.400
Oh, my God. This is so sad.

01:25:08.433 --> 01:25:10.435
Someone get this girl
a tinfoil hat.

01:25:10.469 --> 01:25:12.270
Maybe I'll get her one.

01:25:12.304 --> 01:25:15.007
She had so many opportunities
and she squandered them.

01:25:15.041 --> 01:25:16.976
Spoiled little brats
usually do that.

01:25:17.009 --> 01:25:18.577
Can't get arrested. No.

01:25:18.610 --> 01:25:22.048
Alicia, that's harsh.
She worked hard.

01:25:22.081 --> 01:25:23.850
She worked her way to New York.
Just like you did.

01:25:26.018 --> 01:25:28.855
Her parents paid for her college
free and clear,

01:25:28.888 --> 01:25:30.757
supported her financially
in New York City

01:25:30.790 --> 01:25:32.759
while she went on auditions all
day, whatever she did.

01:25:32.792 --> 01:25:35.393
She didn't work
and pay for her apartment.

01:25:35.427 --> 01:25:37.930
Do you know where I'd be
right now if I had that?

01:25:38.931 --> 01:25:40.833
She does have talent though.

01:25:40.867 --> 01:25:43.368
She made it on Broadway and
in Hollywood because of that,

01:25:43.401 --> 01:25:45.370
not because her parents paid
for her apartment.

01:25:45.403 --> 01:25:47.940
You're right.
It wasn't just her parents.

01:25:47.974 --> 01:25:51.043
I'm sure she had a little help
from the casting couch as well.

01:25:51.077 --> 01:25:53.512
You really think
the world is rigged, don't you?

01:25:53.545 --> 01:25:55.313
I know it is.

01:25:55.347 --> 01:25:57.984
Girls, we're here to celebrate.

01:25:58.017 --> 01:26:02.755
Listen, I like Katie.
I always have. I wish her well.

01:26:03.455 --> 01:26:06.993
Here's to Katie.
Without her I wouldn't be here.

01:26:11.898 --> 01:26:13.699
Oh, I had a house on the beach,
I would never leave.

01:26:13.733 --> 01:26:16.636
Oh, she tweeted.
Katie just tweeted.

01:26:16.669 --> 01:26:17.770
I'm going to read it.

01:26:18.871 --> 01:26:20.673
"I'm free."

01:26:31.616 --> 01:26:36.088
<i>I'm free.
I'm free by choice.</i>

01:26:37.757 --> 01:26:40.726
<i>We are as free as we are moral.</i>

01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:44.964
<i>As our morality increases,
our freedom increases.</i>

01:26:44.997 --> 01:26:49.802
<i>As our morality decreases,
our freedom decreases.</i>

01:26:51.070 --> 01:26:53.505
<i>I worship truth.</i>

01:26:53.538 --> 01:26:57.877
<i>Truth dictates the quality
of your life. It's valuable.</i>

01:26:58.978 --> 01:27:03.515
<i>The less truth you have in your
life, the more you will suffer.</i>

01:27:05.685 --> 01:27:08.420
<i>Stop lying to yourself.</i>

01:27:09.889 --> 01:27:13.425
<i>The dark state will fail.</i>

01:27:13.860 --> 01:27:16.461
<i>The war is on.</i>

01:27:18.197 --> 01:27:20.900
<i>You cannot stand up</i>

01:27:21.466 --> 01:27:25.805
<i>against the force of creation
and win.</i>

01:27:29.608 --> 01:27:30.943
<i>Godspeed.</i>
