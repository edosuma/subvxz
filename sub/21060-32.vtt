"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.482 --> 00:36.551
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.586 --> 00:39.103
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:39.137 --> 00:40.655
in a court of law.

00:42.793 --> 00:45.586
-I met my wife when we were
in college together.

00:45.620 --> 00:48.137
Right after college I went
to the police academy.

00:48.172 --> 00:50.931
And she knew the commitment
that she was making
to be a police wife,

00:50.965 --> 00:54.551
because her dad is a career-long
police officer.

00:54.586 --> 00:57.206
It'’s a completely invaluable
asset that I have.

00:57.241 --> 01:00.620
And I wouldn'’t have been able
to do this job this long
without her.

01:00.655 --> 01:04.551
-Woman [over radio]:
[indistinct] ...for criminal
mischief there.

01:04.586 --> 01:07.724
-It'’s fictitious.
Uh, I got this green car
in front of us

01:07.758 --> 01:10.310
with a temp tag on it,
and, uh...

01:10.344 --> 01:15.379
it shows that it expires June,
but the system shows
that it expires March.

01:15.413 --> 01:19.448
Now, sometimes they'’ll cover
these temp tags up, uh,
so they can use '’em longer.

01:19.482 --> 01:21.620
So I'’m gonna make a stop
on it and contact the driver.

01:21.655 --> 01:23.793

coming to Steele.

01:43.034 --> 01:46.275

-Okay, we'’re coming up
to 86th here.

02:18.517 --> 02:20.586
Still northbound.

02:21.931 --> 02:24.068
All right, we'’re gonna be
eastbound 86th.

02:24.103 --> 02:27.551
It dead-ends up here,
so stand by for a foot bail
if he goes.

02:29.137 --> 02:31.862
-Woman [over radio]: Copy.
Foot bail to dead end, probably.

02:34.862 --> 02:37.724
-Coming in to the, uh,

along the south side
of the, uh, water
treatment plant.

02:49.379 --> 02:52.689
Again, we are off-road
in the in the grassy

02:54.413 --> 02:58.379
-Woman [over radio]:
Copy. Still on the grass
at the water treatment plant.

03:00.758 --> 03:03.310
-All right, he'’s
kind of losing it up here.

03:03.344 --> 03:05.551
And he'’s gonna foot bail.

03:05.586 --> 03:08.241
He'’s-- Yep, crashed out,

03:29.275 --> 03:33.379

-Out of the car, pal.

-Get on the ground.

-You got any guns on you?
-No.

04:04.586 --> 04:06.827
-One in custody.
Code four.

04:06.862 --> 04:09.034
Let'’s get him up.

04:09.068 --> 04:11.448
-Can I put my shoes on, sir?
-No.

04:13.103 --> 04:15.448
-Can I get a drink
of my water before I go?

04:15.482 --> 04:18.724
-You'’re not
in much of a position
to be asking questions, man.

04:18.758 --> 04:21.379
-I need some water, sir.
-Well, we could all
use some water,

04:21.413 --> 04:23.482
but right now,
we don'’t all get what we want.

04:23.517 --> 04:25.586
-Take him to my car
and put him in the back?

04:25.620 --> 04:28.034
What'’s your first name?
-Jon.

04:28.068 --> 04:30.689
-You said Jonathan?
I'’ll get the doors, brother.

04:36.827 --> 04:38.413
-Have a seat.

04:40.206 --> 04:41.379
-All right.

04:41.413 --> 04:44.310
-So, are
our cars crashed?
-No.

04:44.344 --> 04:46.896
-Good job.
-Yeah. No cars crashed.

04:46.931 --> 04:49.103
I thought he was gonna
foot bail here, but...

04:49.137 --> 04:50.896
he went ahead and took
the, uh...
-Scenic route?

04:50.931 --> 04:53.482
-...the scenic route,
the one less taken.

04:53.517 --> 04:56.413
All right, Jon.
We'’ll start with this...

04:57.620 --> 05:00.103
How come you ran from me
when I tried to stop you?

05:01.379 --> 05:03.758
-You'’re after me
'’cause I got a felony warrant.

05:03.793 --> 05:06.344
-You got a felony warrant?
What do you have a warrant for?

05:06.379 --> 05:09.310
-Auto theft.
-You got a warrant
for auto theft?

05:09.344 --> 05:11.862
-Is it your car?
-It'’s my girlfriend's car.

05:11.896 --> 05:13.620
-It'’s your girlfriend's car?
Okay.

05:13.655 --> 05:16.034
I mean, what was going
through your head when
you took off running, man?

05:16.068 --> 05:17.931
I mean, how many times
have you ran from the police?

05:17.965 --> 05:19.275
-Twenty-six times.

05:19.310 --> 05:23.103
-You ran from the police
26 times?

05:23.137 --> 05:25.965
And how old are you?
-Twenty-eight.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.482
-You'’re 28 years old
and you'’ve ran from the police
26 times?

05:29.517 --> 05:32.689
Do you have any kids, Jon?
-Yeah, I have one,
a four-year-old daughter

05:32.724 --> 05:36.275
that I would like to call
real quick '’cause they don't get
collect phone calls.

05:36.310 --> 05:39.931
-Have you ever considered
what type of an impact
that has on your daughter?

05:39.965 --> 05:41.206
You know?
Man, look at me.

05:41.241 --> 05:43.241
You can change that, dude.
Your four-year-old daughter--

05:43.275 --> 05:45.586
-One time I was the best dad
around, bro.

05:45.620 --> 05:49.241
I worked every day...
made good money,

05:49.275 --> 05:52.344
took my daughter out
almost every day.

05:52.379 --> 05:55.241
But... they took her
from me, bro.

05:55.275 --> 05:57.034
-Do you use drugs, man?

05:57.068 --> 05:59.517
-Yeah.
-What kind of drugs do you use?

05:59.551 --> 06:03.068
-Meth.
-Meth?
Did you use today?

06:03.103 --> 06:04.862
-Every day, bro.
-Every day?

06:04.896 --> 06:06.379
-It'’s the only thing
that keeps me sane.

06:06.413 --> 06:07.586
-Do you think
that this is gonna be

06:07.620 --> 06:09.896
a turning point
for you in your life?

06:09.931 --> 06:11.482
And be honest.

06:11.517 --> 06:15.068
-Hope so, and, like,
I'’ve been trying to change, bro.

06:15.103 --> 06:17.862
Like, I haven'’t been
stealing cars.

06:17.896 --> 06:21.448
I haven'’t been hurting people
or doing anything
like that, like--

06:21.482 --> 06:23.103
-I want you to be
a father.

06:23.137 --> 06:25.758
'’Cause I'm not just
out here to arrest people
and chase the bad guys.

06:25.793 --> 06:28.689
It'’s fun, dude, but I'm
really out here to change lives.

06:28.724 --> 06:32.413
-I understand, sir.
-So I hope that for you.

06:32.448 --> 06:35.068
-It'’s hard.
It'’s really hard.

06:35.103 --> 06:38.413
-All right, man.
Well, the car'’s not
a reported steal

06:38.448 --> 06:42.620
as of now, so,
because you weren'’t able
to get out of the car and run,

06:42.655 --> 06:45.586
you'’re gonna be
going to jail today
for a felony charge

06:45.620 --> 06:49.827
of vehicular eluding,
and you got a felony warrant
for motor vehicle theft out,

06:49.862 --> 06:51.137
and you know that, right?

06:51.172 --> 06:53.896
-Mm, I should have
two other ones.

06:53.931 --> 06:55.448
-Well, you might have
a couple other ones,

06:55.482 --> 06:56.896
but that'’s the one
I know about right now.

06:56.931 --> 06:59.275
All right, Jon.
Just sit tight.
-[car door shuts]

07:01.862 --> 07:05.758
-Yeah, the adrenaline rush
that I have with-- call to call,

07:05.793 --> 07:09.758
different, different calls,
different days, never the
same call.

07:09.793 --> 07:11.379
Never know when
that adrenaline'’s gonna kick in,

07:11.413 --> 07:14.620
and you'’re gonna wanna
have to take off after somebody

07:14.655 --> 07:16.655
or possibly get in a fight
with someone.

07:17.965 --> 07:19.793
We'’re heading
to a wanted person.

07:19.827 --> 07:23.206
Individual called, saying
there'’s a wanted person
inside a residence.

07:23.241 --> 07:25.344
We verified that he has
two warrants through the county

07:25.379 --> 07:27.137
and a possible one
through another city.

07:27.172 --> 07:30.310
So we'’re gonna,
hopefully, locate him
before he takes off on us.

07:33.241 --> 07:35.827
Is there any doors on that side?

07:35.862 --> 07:37.931

-Uh, no--
-Did you see the cars
drive by?

11:08.206 --> 11:10.103
-Uh-uh.
-'’Cause you were walking
with the dog.

11:10.137 --> 11:12.000
-Yeah.
-You had the dog and then
you walked back

11:12.034 --> 11:14.275
into the apar--
into the duplex, and then
you bolted on me.

11:14.310 --> 11:16.827
-Nah-- Yeah?
-Yeah.

11:16.862 --> 11:19.689
-I was just doing
my evening ride.

11:19.724 --> 11:21.068
-Your evening ride?
-Yeah.

11:21.103 --> 11:23.344
-Why didn'’t you stop
when I had the sirens on?

11:23.379 --> 11:25.172
-I didn'’t know they were
for me, I thought you were--

11:25.206 --> 11:26.896
-Who else was out there?
Nobody else was out there.

11:26.931 --> 11:28.655
-I thought there was a car
driving by or something.

11:28.689 --> 11:30.586
-All right.
All right, well, tonight
you'’re gonna be booked

11:30.620 --> 11:33.758
for your two warrants,
possibly the one
through Goddard,

11:33.793 --> 11:36.517
and obstruct,
because you took off on me.

11:36.551 --> 11:37.655
-Yeah, I know.
-Got it?

11:37.689 --> 11:39.827
All right, real quick.
Did you think you had me?

11:39.862 --> 11:41.034
-Yeah.
-You think you did?

11:41.068 --> 11:42.517
-Yeah.
-All right.

11:42.551 --> 11:45.379
-I would'’ve had him for sure.
-You would'’ve had him for sure?

11:45.413 --> 11:48.551
-Well, lesson for next time,
think a little bit, all right?

11:48.586 --> 11:50.724
Keeps you from getting hurt
and myself from getting hurt.
Got it?

11:50.758 --> 11:52.068
-Yeah.
-All right, Jeremy.

11:52.103 --> 11:54.206
-I'’m gonna say [bleep]
hid in that alleyway, though.

11:54.241 --> 11:55.482
-Oh? That--
-On that bike.

11:55.517 --> 11:57.137
-That'’ll get you.
All right?

11:57.172 --> 11:59.482
-Those people out there
screaming because I almost
ran into their car.

11:59.517 --> 12:01.965
-See? Then you would'’ve
had a destruction of property
on you.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
-I know.
-All right, Jeremy.
See you next time.

12:04.034 --> 12:06.344
-Thank you.

12:06.379 --> 12:09.000
-I'’ll take this bike,
and, uh, he gave me
permission to give it

12:09.034 --> 12:12.241
to the lady
that stays at this address
that he ran from.

12:12.275 --> 12:14.517
So I'’m gonna speak
with her real quick.

12:17.241 --> 12:18.689
-[knocking on door]

12:21.137 --> 12:23.241
-How'’s it going?
-Did you get him?

12:23.275 --> 12:24.827
-Oh, yeah.
-All right.

12:24.862 --> 12:26.413
-So who is he?

12:26.448 --> 12:29.068
-He is a friend of my son.
-A friend of your son?

12:29.103 --> 12:32.137
-Yeah, he'’s been here
for about two weeks.

12:32.172 --> 12:35.344
Um, I found out
two days ago...
-Mm-hm?

12:35.379 --> 12:40.862
-that he had an armed robbery
with a weapon or something
like that.

12:40.896 --> 12:45.379
He was on 905,
adult probation.
-Okay.

12:45.413 --> 12:47.172
-And he ran from everything.
-Okay.

12:47.206 --> 12:50.620
Um, basically, right before,
right as he walked in,

12:50.655 --> 12:52.137
I think he knew I was coming.
-Mm-hm.

12:52.172 --> 12:54.206
-He saw me in the alleyway.
-He threw his dog in here.

12:54.241 --> 12:56.862
-He put the dog in
and came out, and got
on the bike and bounced on me.

12:56.896 --> 12:58.827
Uh, you probably saw us
run after him.
-Yeah.

12:58.862 --> 13:00.551
-Uh, but we caught him--
we got him down the street.

13:00.586 --> 13:02.413
Uh, that'’s his bike.
That'’s his hat.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.482
He said it would be okay
if we can leave it with you.

13:04.517 --> 13:05.758
You have a better night, okay?

13:05.793 --> 13:07.758
-All right.
-All right, thank you.

13:09.862 --> 13:13.000
-Worked for Stockton PD
for about 14 years.

13:13.034 --> 13:14.103
It'’s a fun place to work.

13:14.137 --> 13:16.862
My partner and I work
in a proactive unit.

13:16.896 --> 13:19.413
The thing that keeps me
motivated is, uh,
the people here.

13:19.448 --> 13:22.517
Uh, I enjoy getting out
and talking to people,

13:22.551 --> 13:25.034
working on the problems
that they'’re having
in their area.

13:25.068 --> 13:28.413
Trying to take care
of whatever the issues are.

13:28.448 --> 13:31.896
That'’s a real motivator for me.

13:31.931 --> 13:36.241
-We'’re gonna go contact
some subjects, just, uh, one
ducked down behind a car.

13:37.275 --> 13:40.551
He has, uh... bushy hair.

13:42.827 --> 13:44.758
Looks like he'’s in the rear
passenger seat.

13:44.793 --> 13:47.655
-Yep.
-And two more going
in the store.

13:52.206 --> 13:54.482
What are you guys doing?
-Nothing.

13:54.517 --> 13:55.862
-Anybody on probation or parole?

13:55.896 --> 13:58.068
What are you reaching
down there for?

13:58.103 --> 14:00.379
Oh, you got a monitor.

14:00.413 --> 14:02.413
So you must be on probation
or parole.

14:02.448 --> 14:04.000
Which one?

14:04.034 --> 14:05.413
-Parole.
-Parole?

14:05.448 --> 14:07.689
What are you on parole for?
-Uh, firearm.

14:07.724 --> 14:09.137
-Firearm.
All right.

14:09.172 --> 14:12.034
Any firearms in the car?

14:12.068 --> 14:14.448
-No?
-Two just went in the store.

14:14.482 --> 14:17.137
-[indistinct]

14:17.172 --> 14:20.379
-All right.
-Go ahead, pop on out.

14:20.413 --> 14:22.482
Face that way,
hands on top of your head.

14:26.793 --> 14:29.034
-You on probation
or parole?
-I'’m on parole.

14:29.068 --> 14:30.413
-All right.

14:30.448 --> 14:32.827
What are you on parole for?

14:32.862 --> 14:35.517
-For guns.
-For guns?

14:35.551 --> 14:37.620
Any guns in the car?
-Nope.

14:39.310 --> 14:42.620
Come on out.
Turn around and face the car.

14:42.655 --> 14:44.586
What are those pills
you just dropped?
-Vicodin.

14:44.620 --> 14:45.689
Do you have a prescription?

14:45.724 --> 14:48.000
-No, I don'’t.
-You don'’t.

14:48.034 --> 14:49.413
Step over them.

14:50.689 --> 14:52.448
Spread your feet.

14:54.172 --> 14:56.896
Hey, another with a red shirt
inside the store.

14:56.931 --> 14:59.172
-Red shirt, red shirt
and black T-shirt.

14:59.206 --> 15:00.655
-Can you pull my pants
up for me, sir?

15:00.689 --> 15:03.103
-Can you relax?
-Just '’cause they're
falling down...

15:03.137 --> 15:04.482
-Okay.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.931
Got some pills here.
He dropped two when I got him
out of the car.

15:11.965 --> 15:15.275
He'’s got another pill bottle
in the glove box.

15:15.310 --> 15:18.068
And then another one
in the center console here.

15:18.103 --> 15:22.206
These two on the passenger side
were on, uh, both on parole.

15:22.241 --> 15:24.655
It says hydrocodone,
but we'’ll have to double-check.

15:24.689 --> 15:27.862
Looks like they'’re trying
to probably sell some pills.

15:30.551 --> 15:33.482
-You got, uh,
packaging materials
right here, Kevin.

15:33.517 --> 15:36.068
-You got what?
-Packaging materials.

15:36.103 --> 15:39.448
-Typically used
for narcotic sales.

15:39.482 --> 15:43.068
-A little bit of weed,
and then a large amount
of cash.

15:43.103 --> 15:45.551
I'’ll go check with the, uh,
the store manager, make sure

15:45.586 --> 15:47.413
they didn'’t toss anything
in there.

15:47.448 --> 15:48.931
-Okay.

15:48.965 --> 15:51.931
The guy in this seat
stuck something in the back
of this seat.

15:51.965 --> 15:54.275
Burner phones, so they buy
these cheap phones,

15:54.310 --> 15:56.448
and then they only turn '’em on
when they'’re gonna do deals,

15:56.482 --> 15:59.620
and then shut '’em off
so they can'’t be tracked.

16:02.206 --> 16:06.068
They didn'’t ditch anything
in the aisles, but he'’s,
you know, just putting his hands

16:06.103 --> 16:09.172
in his pants or something.

16:09.206 --> 16:11.551
-Oh, man, he'’s totally
stuffing something up there,

16:11.586 --> 16:13.931
up in his pants.

16:13.965 --> 16:18.275
-And he says he has, uh,
hemorrhoids, but it'’s probably
just his bag of dope.

16:18.310 --> 16:20.551
-You know you gotta
go get that, right, partner?

16:20.586 --> 16:23.862
-We'’ll see.
-[laughs]

16:23.896 --> 16:25.137
-What'’d you shove
down your pants?

16:25.172 --> 16:27.241
-Huh?
-I said, what did you shove
down your pants?

16:27.275 --> 16:29.241
-I didn'’t shove [bleep]
down my pants.
-You sure?

16:29.275 --> 16:30.689
-I'’m positive.
-If I search you right now,

16:30.724 --> 16:32.827
you'’re not gonna have
a bag of weed
or nothing like that?

16:32.862 --> 16:35.689
-Nah, nothing.
-Were you just adjusting
yourself or what?

16:35.724 --> 16:37.862
-Huh? I was just tightening
my shorts, look, I just

16:37.896 --> 16:39.241
tightened my shorts,
that'’s it.

16:39.275 --> 16:42.206
-What did we do wrong?
-There'’s narcotics in the car.

16:42.241 --> 16:44.758
-Huh?
-There'’s narcotics in the car.

16:44.793 --> 16:48.241
-There'’s a scale
and there'’s material
for packaging marijuana.

16:48.275 --> 16:50.482
-[laughing]
-And there'’s also codeine--

16:50.517 --> 16:52.965
And there'’s also codeine.
-You laugh like I didn'’t
find anything.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.896
-You laugh like we sell weed.
We smoke weed for ailments.

16:55.931 --> 16:57.517
-What about the codeine?

16:57.551 --> 17:00.172
-Huh?
-What about all the codeine
with no prescription?

17:00.206 --> 17:01.793
-What codeine?
-All the codeine in there?

17:01.827 --> 17:05.241
-[bleep] I use all of that.
-Really? Where'’s
your prescription?

17:05.275 --> 17:07.344
-It'’s in the house.
-Where'’s your prescription?

17:07.379 --> 17:10.586
-At the house.
-Oh, so then, it'’s a felony
for not having it with you.

17:10.620 --> 17:12.827
-How'’s it--
All right. I ain'’t gonna
argue with you.

17:12.862 --> 17:14.310
-Not so funny anymore,
is it?

17:14.344 --> 17:15.620
-It'’s all right.
-No.

17:15.655 --> 17:17.896
-Can I go buy my water?
I'’m hot as [bleep].

17:17.931 --> 17:20.206
-Oh, it'’ll be about another
couple minutes, all right?

17:22.000 --> 17:25.896
-There'’s hydrocodone in there.
Who'’s is it?

17:25.931 --> 17:27.689
Huh?
-Let'’s go.

17:27.724 --> 17:29.482
-Let'’s go?
That'’s your answer?

17:29.517 --> 17:34.137
-It ain'’t mine. Did you find
any in my vicinity,
anywhere by me?

17:34.172 --> 17:35.206
-Okay.
-All right.

17:35.241 --> 17:37.172
That'’s all you wanna say?

17:37.206 --> 17:39.655
-You gonna put some charges
on me?

17:39.689 --> 17:41.896
-That'’s all you got to say?

17:41.931 --> 17:44.517
-I got nothing to say.
-Okay. Nothing to say?

17:44.551 --> 17:45.586
Cool.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.724
-What do you wanna do?
-They all need to go, for this.

17:50.758 --> 17:53.068
-Okay.
-'’Cause nobody's
coming upon it.

17:53.103 --> 17:58.379
-All right. What did we find?
Just the pills and what else?

17:58.413 --> 18:02.241
-Pills. Money. Phones.
-Okay.

18:02.275 --> 18:04.275
You'’re going to the jail
for the stuff that
was in the car,

18:04.310 --> 18:06.793
the pills and so forth.
It'’s not a huge charge,
not a big deal.

18:08.172 --> 18:10.068
Scoot over there, Caesar.

18:10.103 --> 18:11.758
Because the stories
don'’t match up, unfortunately,

18:11.793 --> 18:14.758
we gotta take all you guys.
Okay?

18:20.241 --> 18:23.965
You need two hands
to get it out or one hand?

18:24.000 --> 18:26.379
Is it just in a single bag?

18:26.413 --> 18:29.068
-It'’s also a health
and safety issue for yourself.

18:30.620 --> 18:32.000
-Well, obviously
it'’s not weed.

18:32.034 --> 18:34.482
-I'’ll say where it's at,
but they can'’t hear me, right?

18:34.517 --> 18:37.241
They'’ll get mad
'’cause they don't know I use it.

18:37.275 --> 18:39.310
-No. Right.
-It'’s a misdemeanor.

18:40.827 --> 18:41.931
-I snort it.

18:43.068 --> 18:45.103
-How long you been
doing that?

18:45.137 --> 18:47.655
-I think the last three years.
-The last three years?

18:48.689 --> 18:50.344
-Go ahead, stand up for me.

18:53.137 --> 18:55.482
-[indistinct]

18:55.517 --> 18:57.586
-Yeah, we'’ll talk about that.
Can you grab it out right now?

18:57.620 --> 18:59.379
-[indistinct]

18:59.413 --> 19:01.689
-Okay.
-It'’s in my ass cheeks.

19:03.137 --> 19:04.689
-I didn'’t look.

19:04.724 --> 19:07.310
It'’s in there, though.

19:07.344 --> 19:08.793
-It'’s in there.

19:11.482 --> 19:12.724
-I appreciate your honesty.

19:12.758 --> 19:15.034
-No problem, sir.
I was just scared.

19:15.068 --> 19:17.379
-Hey, it'’s nothing big.

19:17.413 --> 19:19.379
-All right, thank you, sir.
-Yep.

19:21.137 --> 19:24.413
-Hey, sir?
You guys said you'’re gonna
let me get that call, right?

19:24.448 --> 19:26.793
-Yeah, we'’ll talk
about that down there.
-No problem.

19:26.827 --> 19:28.413
-Feet.

19:28.448 --> 19:30.689
-Put a sample?
-Do you know where
he really put it?

19:30.724 --> 19:33.758
-So he admitted to putting this
in his ass cheeks'’ area.

19:33.793 --> 19:35.137
-You wanna hold it?
-No.

19:35.172 --> 19:37.724
-Uh, he says it'’s personal use,
and he snorts it.

19:37.758 --> 19:40.206
-All right.
-So he retrieved it
for me. We'’re good.

19:40.241 --> 19:41.931
-Good thing
you'’re wearing gloves.

19:41.965 --> 19:43.793
-Yeah.
-All right.

19:44.965 --> 19:46.482
This case really stinks.

19:46.517 --> 19:48.137
[laughter]

19:49.448 --> 19:51.620
-132 and Bush,
I'’ve got him at gunpoint.

19:51.655 --> 19:53.551
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:53.586 --> 19:54.758
Cover is code three.

19:54.793 --> 19:57.724
-[overlapping
police radio chatter]

20:04.241 --> 20:06.206
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'’ll still send
a code three.

20:06.241 --> 20:09.344
-[theme music playing]
