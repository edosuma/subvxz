14:14.922 --> 14:21.928
Fresh produce is for
sale on Tripoli streets.

14:21.929 --> 14:24.063
If you were a small restaurant,

14:24.064 --> 14:25.731
or shopping for a big family,

14:25.732 --> 14:27.866
you'd bring cash, a wheelbarrow,

14:27.867 --> 14:31.938
and load up on what you need.

14:31.939 --> 14:36.175
But the revolution has
brought changed tastes.

14:36.176 --> 14:37.910
Libyans, especially young

14:37.911 --> 14:45.911
Libyans, hunger for
more than just freedom.

14:45.953 --> 14:51.490
They hunger for
places like this.

14:51.491 --> 14:52.491
Kentucky fried chi

14:55.628 --> 14:55.895
chicken.

14:55.896 --> 14:59.165
The colonel, his buddies, the

14:59.166 --> 15:00.399
king and the crown have not made

15:00.400 --> 15:03.669
it here given the uncertainty
of the situation.

15:03.670 --> 15:04.836
In the meantime, places like

15:04.837 --> 15:05.871
this have been popping up.

15:05.872 --> 15:06.306
Uncle Kentucky.

15:06.307 --> 15:13.679
Awesome.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.181
You know where Kentucky is?

15:15.182 --> 15:17.183
Kentucky is from USA.

15:17.184 --> 15:17.884
A part.

15:17.884 --> 15:18.418
Yeah.

15:18.419 --> 15:20.219
This place is new?

15:20.220 --> 15:24.590
Yeah.

15:24.591 --> 15:24.857
It's new.

15:24.858 --> 15:27.226
Before Gaddafi... not possible.

15:27.227 --> 15:27.660
Now it's normal.

15:27.661 --> 15:32.398
Oh, that's nice.

15:32.399 --> 15:33.799
How you found it?

15:33.800 --> 15:37.469
Spicy, delicious.

15:37.470 --> 15:42.274
Johar, like many Libyans his
age, fought to overthrow

15:42.275 --> 15:42.509
Gaddafi.

15:42.510 --> 15:43.709
He was there, gun in hand, when

15:43.710 --> 15:48.380
they stormed Gaddafi's
palace compound.

15:48.381 --> 15:49.781
Happy, excited?

15:49.782 --> 15:52.451
Nice feeling.

15:52.452 --> 16:00.452
Nice feeling that Gaddafi
he killed my cousin.

16:05.032 --> 16:07.499
I don't want anyone
to die in war.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.235
He's killed for nothing.

16:09.236 --> 16:16.642
The first thing I think
that killing people is bad.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.244
He's leave me do that.

16:18.245 --> 16:21.113
Because if I don't kill
him, he kills any.

16:21.114 --> 16:22.148
It's nice to see freedom.

16:22.149 --> 16:23.815
It's nice to see
the bad guy done.

16:23.816 --> 16:24.317
It's nice.

16:24.318 --> 16:25.884
I feel welcome here.

16:25.885 --> 16:27.253
Finally.

16:27.254 --> 16:30.589
We say no on him.

16:30.590 --> 16:32.458
He's now died.

16:32.459 --> 16:35.661
That's what we wanted.

16:35.662 --> 16:39.131
To Johar, a few pieces of

16:39.132 --> 16:41.900
greasy fried chicken eaten in a

16:41.901 --> 16:49.901
brightly colored fast food
setting means more.

16:52.245 --> 16:53.412
My country.

16:53.413 --> 16:55.147
I want the feeling of
the taste of freedom.

16:55.148 --> 16:57.616
The taste of freedom.

16:57.617 --> 17:04.256
It's a nice taste.

17:09.296 --> 17:12.897

Outside Tripoli's
center, there's this.

17:32.652 --> 17:37.022
One time axis of all
power and untold evil.

17:37.023 --> 17:41.460
Sinister offices, barracks,

17:41.461 --> 17:47.266
residences, on top of secret
tunnels and underground

17:47.267 --> 17:48.767
facilities.

17:48.768 --> 17:56.768
Gaddafi's enormous compound.

17:57.710 --> 18:00.011
Most everything belonging to or

18:00.012 --> 18:08.012
associated with Gaddafi
was destroyed.

18:15.094 --> 18:19.598
On August 3rd, 2011,
it fell to rebels.

18:19.599 --> 18:25.337
Gaddafi and his
family having fled.

18:25.338 --> 18:31.277
This is what's left
of Gaddafi's palace.

18:55.402 --> 18:58.804
So when's the last

18:58.805 --> 19:03.775
Last time is when the
revolution is finishing.

19:03.776 --> 19:09.815
The machinery, going in fast.

After then, coming
a lot of people.

Listening about something
expensive here.

Like the salt.

He wants us to stop
filming right now.

19:20.527 --> 19:20.827
Okay.

19:20.828 --> 19:22.761
While talking, we didn't notice

19:22.762 --> 19:24.696
several pickup trucks of local

19:24.697 --> 19:28.166
militia had closed in on us.

Whatever the case, they're
the group in charge today.

19:47.053 --> 19:54.326
An argument ensues between
our guys and their guys.

19:54.327 --> 19:55.561
All of whom fought against the

19:55.562 --> 20:02.902
same forces on this
ground a year ago.

20:11.344 --> 20:11.578
Okay.

20:11.579 --> 20:19.579
Let's go.

20:21.688 --> 20:22.021
Hold it down.

20:22.022 --> 20:25.090
Hold it down.

20:25.091 --> 20:26.693
Hold it down.

20:37.103 --> 20:39.905
Libya denied there's an
imminent threat to safety of

20:39.906 --> 20:41.106
westerners in Benghazi.

20:41.107 --> 20:42.541
This follow's Britain’s advice

20:42.542 --> 20:43.542
on Thursday that westerners

20:43.543 --> 20:45.110
should get out of the city.

20:45.111 --> 20:50.616
Warning of a specific
and imminent threat.

20:50.617 --> 20:51.850
If you follow the news you'll

20:51.851 --> 20:53.251
be reminded about how the lack

20:53.252 --> 20:54.720
of centralized power in the wake

20:54.721 --> 20:57.656
of the 2011 conflict has seen an

20:57.657 --> 21:01.460
increase in Islamic
militancy in lib Libya.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.362
Westerners and Libyans are
still very concerned.

21:03.363 --> 21:05.997
What you see is not encouraging.

21:05.998 --> 21:09.034
Kidnappings in Algeria,
unrest in Mali.

21:09.035 --> 21:10.235
Terrorist cells to the south.

21:10.236 --> 21:12.971
Deadly riots in Egypt.

21:12.972 --> 21:14.873
Of course, extremist attacks in

21:14.874 --> 21:16.308
Benghazi that killed the U.S.

21:16.309 --> 21:16.609
Ambassador.

21:16.610 --> 21:19.244
All those things are
very real concerns.

21:19.245 --> 21:20.712
But if you only look at what's

21:20.713 --> 21:23.114
on the news, you can miss maybe

21:23.115 --> 21:29.821
what's a bigger picture.

21:29.822 --> 21:33.592
Another morning in Tripoli
and life goes on.

21:33.593 --> 21:36.528
Vendors are out.

21:36.529 --> 21:42.668
People go about their
daily routines.

21:42.669 --> 21:46.271
This is our traditional
breakfast.

21:46.272 --> 21:50.676
What is this dish called?

21:50.677 --> 21:52.711
An overstretched
doughnut, I suppose.

21:52.712 --> 21:53.045
Right.

21:53.045 --> 21:53.446
With an egg.

21:53.447 --> 21:54.546
With an egg on top.

21:54.547 --> 21:57.082
What's a little pancake
they put on top?

21:57.083 --> 21:58.216
Just to hold the egg in?

21:58.217 --> 21:59.685
Just to hold the egg in.

21:59.686 --> 22:02.521
It's like a hat to
cover up something.

22:02.522 --> 22:03.855
You can get them with cheese,

22:03.856 --> 22:06.792
you can get them with chili

22:06.793 --> 22:08.660
paste, with honey, with sugar.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.496
How do you like yours?

22:10.497 --> 22:12.163
I like mine cooked,
to be honest.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.232
What's the name of
this neighborhood?

22:14.233 --> 22:16.368
This is a cradle
of the revolution.

22:16.369 --> 22:18.336
This was the first
neighborhood to rise up?

22:18.337 --> 22:18.971
Yes.

22:18.972 --> 22:20.372
This is the first
place to rise up.

22:20.373 --> 22:24.810
Why do you think
this neighborhood?

22:24.811 --> 22:27.846
It's been always liked
here by the regime.

22:27.847 --> 22:28.947
They made them feel like they're

22:28.948 --> 22:32.350
not from this country,
to be honest.

22:32.351 --> 22:38.590
Uh-huh.

22:38.591 --> 22:40.492
And we go for it.

22:40.493 --> 22:42.127
Oh, yeah, dip.

22:42.128 --> 22:42.995
Right in the egg.

22:42.996 --> 22:44.496
Dip it in the egg.

22:44.497 --> 22:45.097
Delicious.

22:45.098 --> 22:47.198
So where were you
when it all started?

22:47.199 --> 22:48.366
I was in London.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.702
Actually, Manchester
at the time.

22:50.703 --> 22:50.937
Why?

22:50.938 --> 22:53.572
By the 27th, I was in Libya.

22:53.573 --> 22:55.707
We went out to see
his house yesterday.

22:55.708 --> 22:56.443
The compound.

22:56.444 --> 22:57.576
I was one of the guys who

22:57.577 --> 22:58.877
entered from the Southern gates.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.011
The northern gates.

23:00.012 --> 23:03.314
Akram is in the
security business.

23:03.315 --> 23:06.818
A thriving industry here as
you can probably imagine.

23:06.819 --> 23:07.953
A lot of things happened in a

23:07.954 --> 23:11.322
lot of different parts of the

23:11.323 --> 23:12.658
country sort of simultaneously.

23:12.659 --> 23:15.093
Kind of amazing all these people

23:15.094 --> 23:15.862
came together pretty fast.

23:15.863 --> 23:16.995
How did it happen?

23:16.996 --> 23:17.864
Ease city.

23:17.864 --> 23:18.130
Twitter.

23:18.130 --> 23:18.531
Twitter?

23:18.532 --> 23:19.631
It was really like that?

23:19.632 --> 23:23.134
Yes.

23:23.135 --> 23:24.135
We sent so much information.

23:24.136 --> 23:26.071
We get a phone call from Tripoli

23:26.072 --> 23:30.809
or Benghazi or whatever.

23:30.810 --> 23:32.243
Google earth.

23:32.244 --> 23:36.081
We verify that's the location
that needs to be hit.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.348
Then it's gone.

23:37.349 --> 23:38.017
Really?

23:38.018 --> 23:39.451
How does that feel knowing you

23:39.452 --> 23:44.389
can call in a tomahawk
missile over there?

23:44.390 --> 23:46.558
It's out of the movies.

23:46.559 --> 23:49.294
Did anyone think in their

23:49.295 --> 23:52.798
lifetime they'd see the end
of this son of a bitch?

23:52.799 --> 23:54.700
A lot of people said
they never dreamed.

23:54.701 --> 23:57.202
I don't know if you call
them hope, dreams, wishes.

23:57.203 --> 23:59.404
It was just something
in the sky.

23:59.405 --> 24:00.072
Something I look at every night.

24:00.073 --> 24:02.340
When I hit that point and got in

24:02.341 --> 24:06.311
and stood on Gaddafi's body,
any dream will come true.

24:06.312 --> 24:09.247
What's the situation now?

24:09.248 --> 24:10.816
It's fluid.

24:10.817 --> 24:12.884
It can swing any direction.

24:12.885 --> 24:15.353
Well, look, what happened in

24:15.354 --> 24:16.722
Benghazi a few months ago, I

24:16.723 --> 24:18.724
mean, what does this
mean to the country?

24:18.725 --> 24:21.660
I think there is a dark
mysterious hand that doesn't

24:21.661 --> 24:23.529
like this country to prosper.

24:23.530 --> 24:25.130
They see system and organization

24:25.131 --> 24:29.034
as a big enemy to them.

24:29.035 --> 24:31.603
These are slowly
getting diminished.

24:31.604 --> 24:34.372
A matter of time before
we can get rid of them.

24:34.373 --> 24:36.575
How hard is that going to be?

24:36.576 --> 24:37.709
Not at all.

24:37.710 --> 24:39.477
We got rid of Gaddafi.

24:39.478 --> 24:39.979
Nothing else is hard.

24:39.980 --> 24:42.514
I like your attitude.

24:42.515 --> 24:44.482
The fluid situation in Libya has

24:44.483 --> 24:46.718
been intensifying
since our arrival.

24:46.719 --> 24:51.590
We've had to change our
behavior, constantly moving.

24:51.591 --> 24:53.692
Should I be wearing one of these

24:53.693 --> 24:56.928
cool journalist safari
jackets at this point?

24:56.929 --> 24:58.764
So it seemed a good
time or maybe not.

24:58.765 --> 24:59.532
Saddle up.

24:59.533 --> 25:02.100
To go to Misrata.

25:02.101 --> 25:03.535
Okay, guys.

25:03.536 --> 25:03.803
We can go.

25:03.804 --> 25:06.271
Roger that.

25:06.272 --> 25:08.974
Since the revolution, Misrata

25:08.975 --> 25:10.942
has been the most secure city in

25:10.943 --> 25:11.844
Libya, but over the last two

25:11.845 --> 25:15.747
weeks in a hail of bullets and

25:15.748 --> 25:19.485
hand-thrown grenade attacks, an

25:20.953 --> 25:21.520
imam, security forces and a

25:21.521 --> 25:25.591
police officer have
all been killed.

25:25.592 --> 25:28.594
I want you to move forward.

25:28.595 --> 25:29.195
Come past me.

25:29.196 --> 25:32.831
All along the narrow
congested highway, there are

25:32.832 --> 25:33.800
checkpoints manned mostly by

25:33.801 --> 25:36.501
local militias, and I want to

25:36.502 --> 25:38.570
stress most of them
are friendly enough.

25:38.571 --> 25:40.972
We are, however, in a hurry to

25:40.973 --> 25:43.508
get to Misrata before dark.

25:43.509 --> 25:51.509
Traveling at night around
here is not advised.

26:03.162 --> 26:04.630
Drop the camera.

26:04.631 --> 26:05.364
Yep, yep.

26:05.365 --> 26:09.801
Stop the camera.

26:09.802 --> 26:11.670
Pulling in a town after dark,

26:11.671 --> 26:18.243
it doesn't feel like a happy
place to be right now.

26:18.244 --> 26:20.511
Misrata is where some of the
fiercest and most heroic

26:20.512 --> 26:22.614
struggles of the war occurred.

26:22.615 --> 26:23.449
Resistance was the most

26:23.450 --> 26:26.484
determined, and the response by

26:26.485 --> 26:31.022
the Gaddafi forces
especially merciless.

26:31.023 --> 26:32.357
We've just learned that earlier

26:32.358 --> 26:33.925
in the day, a city councilman

26:33.926 --> 26:36.227
who was a hero of the revolution

26:36.228 --> 26:39.965
was assassinated, and it's not

26:39.966 --> 26:42.067
clear who's responsible.

26:42.068 --> 26:45.470
Misrata is on full lockdown.

26:45.471 --> 26:48.439
Another checkpoint.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.676
Looking around at the price

26:50.677 --> 26:51.843
this city paid for freedom, you

26:51.844 --> 26:54.112
can see why they don't want to

26:54.113 --> 27:00.720
lose what they
fought so hard for.

27:11.163 --> 27:15.133
Morning in Misrata?

27:15.134 --> 27:16.902
How is it?

27:16.903 --> 27:18.704
Daylight reveals the extent

27:18.705 --> 27:26.705
of the fighting that took
place here not so long ago.

27:32.752 --> 27:39.958
This here used to be
a vegetable market.

27:39.959 --> 27:43.762
Close, one of Gaddafi's
soldiers here closed.

27:43.763 --> 27:45.396
He left him here and ran?

27:45.397 --> 27:49.434
That's what they did in Tripoli.

27:49.435 --> 27:50.702
Just lose their clothes and run

27:50.703 --> 27:52.403
away in the streets
so nobody would know.

27:52.404 --> 27:54.305
This is Hanid, one of the

27:54.306 --> 27:57.242
guys we called the Misrata boys,

27:57.243 --> 27:58.443
basically militia members from

27:58.444 --> 28:00.678
the area who looked out for us

28:00.679 --> 28:07.318
here and Tripoli when thinks
started getting hinky in

28:07.319 --> 28:08.787
neighboring areas.

28:08.788 --> 28:10.421
Hujab these days is hunting down

28:10.422 --> 28:12.523
former Gaddafi supporters.

28:12.524 --> 28:14.325
So the Gaddafi forces rolled in.

28:14.326 --> 28:18.563
They'd use these tanks to
fire... around the city.

28:18.564 --> 28:18.865
Around.

28:18.866 --> 28:26.866
This was the
operation room here.

28:27.706 --> 28:35.706
♪

28:43.489 --> 28:48.726
Now if you had any doubt about
the terrible odds these

28:48.727 --> 28:49.295
young revolutionaries were

28:49.295 --> 28:49.929
facing during the early days of

28:49.929 --> 28:50.629
the fighting, especially in the

28:50.630 --> 28:51.797
months before NATO came in with

28:51.798 --> 28:57.735
air support, check out
Misrata's war museum.

28:57.736 --> 28:58.870
What did this fire?

28:58.871 --> 29:00.806
Fired a rocket.

29:00.807 --> 29:01.073
Homemade.

29:01.073 --> 29:01.707
There's a rocket here.

29:01.708 --> 29:03.909
You had to have some serious

29:03.910 --> 29:06.477
courage to ride around
with this thing.

29:06.478 --> 29:08.646
Why?

29:08.647 --> 29:09.248
We trust our people.

29:09.249 --> 29:11.850
There are a lot of
homemade things here.

29:11.851 --> 29:12.819
This is homemade, too.

29:12.820 --> 29:13.919
Fires rockets.

29:13.920 --> 29:15.286
This is homemade.

29:15.287 --> 29:16.354
This one.

29:16.355 --> 29:18.656
This was from... yes.

29:18.657 --> 29:19.325
We got it.

29:19.326 --> 29:22.027
You took it off a helicopter
and you put it on a car?

29:22.028 --> 29:22.661
Uh-huh.

29:22.662 --> 29:25.931
And you know what this is for?

29:25.932 --> 29:27.498
So it's basically a cross bow

29:27.499 --> 29:30.501
that fires Molotov cocktails.

29:30.502 --> 29:31.602
Try it sometimes.

29:31.603 --> 29:34.973
You're shooting this at
people who have mortars.

29:34.974 --> 29:36.908
And tanks.

29:36.909 --> 29:37.176
Tanks.

29:37.176 --> 29:37.443
Yeah.

29:37.444 --> 29:39.377
You're shooting this at tanks.

29:39.378 --> 29:40.478
Yeah.

29:40.479 --> 29:41.813
That's what we got at the time.

29:41.814 --> 29:42.281
It's what you had.

29:42.282 --> 29:45.050
It's awesome.

29:45.051 --> 29:51.289
The next president of Libya,

29:51.290 --> 29:57.295
the one who's going to be
in charge, this is his.

29:57.296 --> 29:58.230
He has to think twice
before he sits on it.

29:58.230 --> 29:58.898
Never screw your people.

29:58.899 --> 30:00.765
Here, this is Gaddafi stuff.

30:00.766 --> 30:05.236
This was all taken
from the compound.

30:05.237 --> 30:06.038
That's his chair.

30:06.039 --> 30:07.072
Preferred hair products.

30:07.073 --> 30:08.739
His shaving kit.

30:08.740 --> 30:11.242
See he was wearing a mask.

30:11.243 --> 30:11.978
Beauty mask.

30:11.979 --> 30:13.979
I could use some of that.

30:13.980 --> 30:20.485
Gaddafi, he's
beautiful, you know.

30:20.486 --> 30:23.421
And this is the first.

30:23.422 --> 30:23.890
That's the first.

30:23.891 --> 30:27.292
Yeah, that's the first one.

30:27.293 --> 30:28.493
That's a normal guy that went

30:28.494 --> 30:30.195
out to protest the first rally

30:30.196 --> 30:32.330
and somebody come
in and shoot him.

30:32.331 --> 30:34.832
So next day the whole
city came out.

30:34.833 --> 30:36.567
That's when everything started.

30:36.568 --> 30:41.806
These are photos of those
killed during the uprising.

30:41.807 --> 30:44.943
Combatants and bystanders alike.

30:44.944 --> 30:50.781
Her name is Muna.

30:50.782 --> 30:54.485
She was 6 days when she died.

30:54.486 --> 31:02.486
Killed in their homes,
tortured to death in prisons,

31:04.363 --> 31:05.131
snipers.

31:05.132 --> 31:13.132
They killed him, with,
like, a grenade.

31:18.877 --> 31:19.611
Yeah.

31:19.612 --> 31:21.412
You know what he was saying?

31:21.413 --> 31:26.784
He's saying, what's
going on, guys?

31:26.785 --> 31:27.919
Why are you doing that?

31:27.920 --> 31:35.920
We still have the T-shirt
with the blood in it.

31:49.275 --> 31:51.009
Do you know any of these people?

31:51.010 --> 31:54.112
Yeah, I know a couple of them.

31:54.113 --> 31:55.680
I knew a couple.

31:55.681 --> 31:58.549
This guy's Egyptian.

31:58.550 --> 31:59.684
Not even his fight.

31:59.685 --> 32:02.487
He didn't want to leave.

32:02.488 --> 32:07.458
This died in Tripoli.

32:07.459 --> 32:08.127
These are brothers and sister.

32:08.128 --> 32:10.095
One, two, three, four.

32:10.096 --> 32:12.197
They died on the same
day, the same house.

32:12.198 --> 32:15.633
The mother when we found her,
she was holding the kid.

32:15.634 --> 32:16.934
They were both dead and
holding each other.

32:16.935 --> 32:24.935
It was a very sad moment.

33:03.915 --> 33:05.850
I don't know if you noticed,

33:05.851 --> 33:08.753
I'm going full blitzer
on this shoot.

33:08.754 --> 33:13.924
The Mediterranean sea defines
Libya's northern border.

33:13.925 --> 33:15.526
In shacks built along the coast,

33:15.527 --> 33:16.961
people get together on weekends

33:16.962 --> 33:18.463
to do what people do everywhere

33:18.464 --> 33:20.298
in the world in one form or

33:20.299 --> 33:25.002
another since the
beginnings of society.

33:25.003 --> 33:25.904
Like barbecue?

33:25.905 --> 33:27.338
Who does not like barbecue?

33:27.339 --> 33:31.342
There he is.

33:31.343 --> 33:34.745
They sure like him here.

33:34.746 --> 33:35.247
Chase down on animal.

33:35.248 --> 33:39.684
Kill it.

33:39.685 --> 33:44.655
Cycle of life.

33:44.656 --> 33:46.357
Cut it into pieces.

33:46.358 --> 33:50.695
And throw it on a flame.

33:50.696 --> 33:53.298
Freedom fighters.

33:53.299 --> 33:55.933
Ex-freedom fighters.

33:55.934 --> 33:57.602
Chilling, having fun,
making barbecue.

33:57.603 --> 34:04.309
To start, they grill a lamb
in small pieces with a few

34:04.310 --> 34:04.576
veggies.

34:04.577 --> 34:07.178
A beer.

34:07.179 --> 34:13.684
Been a week without any
alcohol of any kind.

34:13.685 --> 34:16.754
I'm enjoying my new
clean living lifestyle.

34:16.755 --> 34:17.623
That's hospitality.

34:17.623 --> 34:19.190
I said it before.

34:19.190 --> 34:20.525
I'll say it again.

34:20.525 --> 34:22.793
Barbecue may not be the road to

34:22.793 --> 34:27.431
world peace, but it's a start.

34:27.433 --> 34:28.433
Awesome food.

34:28.434 --> 34:28.699
Yeah.

34:28.701 --> 34:33.103
Laid back.

34:33.105 --> 34:34.405
In America, laid back.

34:34.406 --> 34:37.775
A stew made of kidneys, liver

34:37.775 --> 34:40.210
and heart served family style.

34:40.212 --> 34:42.980
Feel free to eat with hands.

34:42.981 --> 34:48.085
Right hand only, please.

34:48.085 --> 34:49.587
And a really traditional thing

34:49.588 --> 34:54.958
left over from the Italians,

34:54.960 --> 34:57.728
basically pasta with ragout.

34:57.729 --> 35:05.729
What's this dish called?

35:09.241 --> 35:09.675
It's good.

35:09.676 --> 35:12.610
The Italians left
you one nice thing.

35:12.611 --> 35:17.047
A few nice buildings and pasta.

35:17.048 --> 35:19.250
So the story of Misrata, the

35:19.251 --> 35:21.219
story of Libya seems to be

35:21.220 --> 35:22.887
ordinary people suddenly called

35:22.888 --> 35:24.722
upon to do extraordinary things.

35:24.723 --> 35:27.192
Where were you when
war broke out?

35:27.193 --> 35:30.428
I was in Canada, Montreal.

35:30.429 --> 35:31.796
Studying medicine.

35:31.797 --> 35:32.063
Yes.

35:32.064 --> 35:34.232
The doctor put her medical

35:34.233 --> 35:35.966
studies on hold to help tend all

35:35.967 --> 35:37.235
manner of horrible war injuries.

35:37.236 --> 35:39.069
What kind of procedures were you

35:39.070 --> 35:41.206
doing on a regular basis?

35:41.207 --> 35:41.707
Everything.

35:41.708 --> 35:46.411
Everything. Without prior
practice and practice and

35:46.412 --> 35:48.213
trying to pick up things.

35:48.214 --> 35:49.914
How many patients did
you treat a day?

35:49.915 --> 35:53.284
60, 70, like a lot.

35:53.285 --> 35:54.085
The whole hospital was full.

35:54.086 --> 35:59.790
When you heard he
had been killed?

35:59.791 --> 36:00.025
Relief?

36:00.025 --> 36:00.892
Relief.

36:00.893 --> 36:02.760
I was like realizing that, okay,

36:02.761 --> 36:04.595
it's over and trying to heal my

36:04.596 --> 36:05.763
own wounds because in the middle

36:05.764 --> 36:07.932
of it you just go, go, go, and

36:07.933 --> 36:12.036
you never realize how much
injuries and trauma you get

36:12.037 --> 36:13.538
inside yourself.

36:13.539 --> 36:14.240
Right.

36:14.241 --> 36:15.373
Because before you never

36:15.374 --> 36:17.242
think we're going to survive and

36:17.243 --> 36:18.709
we'll have a fry Libya.

36:18.710 --> 36:19.710
Just like going with the state

36:19.711 --> 36:21.346
of mind that I'm going to do my

36:21.347 --> 36:23.147
best and I'm ready in peace with

36:23.148 --> 36:27.752
myself if I die, and then
you find yourself here now.

36:27.753 --> 36:32.122
It's like... now
it's the gray area.

36:32.123 --> 36:33.691
She risked her life along

36:33.692 --> 36:37.495
with the men, but traditional

36:37.496 --> 36:40.431
rules of conduct do not allow

36:40.432 --> 36:42.467
her to sit with
them during dinner.

36:42.468 --> 36:44.335
She's relegated to what might be

36:44.336 --> 36:46.304
the called the kids' table.

36:46.305 --> 36:47.805
What can one say, we who think

36:47.806 --> 36:50.408
of ourselves as more
enlightened in this area?

36:50.409 --> 36:51.277
I don't know.

36:51.278 --> 36:57.882
Rightly or wrongly
I said nothing.

36:57.883 --> 36:59.384
What does freedom mean?

36:59.385 --> 37:03.921
I don't know that
either, I guess.

37:03.922 --> 37:05.590
For sure it does mean the

37:05.591 --> 37:08.893
freedom to enjoy be a afternoon

37:08.894 --> 37:10.861
no one thought possible only a

37:10.862 --> 37:12.663
little while ago, the freedom,

37:12.664 --> 37:15.032
at least, to joke, to laugh, to

37:15.033 --> 37:23.033
be for a while
relatively carefree.

37:25.844 --> 37:29.615
♪

37:57.576 --> 38:01.078
The road to Tripoli, a
healthy supreme court fast.

38:01.079 --> 38:02.680
Oh, liver sandwich.

38:02.681 --> 38:04.515
When they talk about a high-risk

38:04.516 --> 38:09.954
environment, I think they
were talking about this.

38:09.955 --> 38:17.955
That's good.

38:19.230 --> 38:23.501
Halfway back to Tripoli, the

38:23.502 --> 38:31.376
magnificent ruins
of Leftus Magna.

38:31.377 --> 38:33.043
Arguably the most intact remains

38:33.044 --> 38:41.044
of a Roman city in the world.

38:41.453 --> 38:47.525
It's worth noting that the
emperor was himself Libyan.

38:47.526 --> 38:48.193
That's pretty amazing.

38:48.194 --> 38:56.194
Born right here.

38:56.835 --> 39:04.835
Someone chipped
off all the legs.

39:06.478 --> 39:08.012
No that I was looking.

39:08.013 --> 39:09.914
Everyone else in the world is

39:09.915 --> 39:12.750
overrun with tourists,
but, look, no one.

39:12.751 --> 39:17.655
You're free to
wander as you wish.

39:17.656 --> 39:19.490
Quite a backdrop, you know,

39:19.491 --> 39:21.759
seeing a little dinner theater

39:21.760 --> 39:28.466
production of "our town" a
couple thousand years ago.

39:28.467 --> 39:31.368
Not bad.

39:31.369 --> 39:33.170
The only other visitors today

39:33.171 --> 39:38.142
are a troupe of
Libyan boy scouts.

39:38.143 --> 39:41.679
Bizarrely enough, Gaddafi
himself was once a scout and

39:41.680 --> 39:42.980
this is one of the only

39:42.981 --> 39:44.749
organizations allowed to remain

39:44.750 --> 39:46.150
independent of the government.

39:46.151 --> 39:47.852
Maybe I ought to go down there

39:47.853 --> 39:50.855
and introduce myself,
exchange some boy scout lore.

39:50.856 --> 39:56.427
Yes, yes, I was once
a boy scout, too.

39:56.428 --> 39:56.895
Hello.

39:56.896 --> 39:58.463
Drilled into their heads is

39:58.464 --> 40:04.535
something that was long
ago drilled into mine.

40:04.536 --> 40:07.905
I promise to be trustworthy,
loyal, helpful, friendly,

40:07.906 --> 40:14.211
courteous, kind, obedient,
thrifty, brave, clean and

40:14.212 --> 40:20.185
reverent.

40:54.820 --> 40:57.154
You know, it's been a really

40:57.155 --> 40:59.056
difficult shoot for a
whole lot of reasons.

40:59.057 --> 41:07.057
It's not easy to shoot here.

41:07.566 --> 41:09.133
But in spite of all of that, for

41:09.134 --> 41:14.572
me this was a happy show.

41:14.573 --> 41:15.306
It's Libya.

41:15.307 --> 41:16.507
It was supposed to be the bad

41:16.508 --> 41:21.011
guys, a bad country filled
with bad people, right?

41:21.012 --> 41:22.647
I don't think so.

41:22.648 --> 41:27.051
I met a lot of really
nice people here.

41:27.052 --> 41:30.220
Nobody is saying we're going
to be perfect tomorrow.

41:30.221 --> 41:32.056
Everybody seems to be saying,

41:32.057 --> 41:37.728
you know, look at
us in five years.

41:37.729 --> 41:40.698
Today that's a pretty
reasonable attitude.

41:40.699 --> 41:42.366
This is a place that's filled a

41:42.367 --> 41:43.201
lot of extraordinary people who

41:43.202 --> 41:45.435
have done an extraordinary thing

41:45.436 --> 41:50.808
on very short notice under very

41:50.809 --> 41:53.310
difficult circumstances and at a

41:53.311 --> 41:54.579
very difficult time who are

41:54.580 --> 41:56.346
continuing to do the best they

41:56.347 --> 41:58.316
can, and I wish them well.
