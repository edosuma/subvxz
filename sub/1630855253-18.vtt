00:23.523 --> 00:25.900
Well, I don't see your hand
encrusted in sapphire.

00:25.900 --> 00:29.362
God has chosen me to guide the worthy
through the final judgment.

00:29.362 --> 00:31.072
[Zeke] We all dealt with Chloe's death.

00:31.072 --> 00:32.907
I think this is what I needed to do,

00:32.907 --> 00:34.409
and yet I don't feel any better.

00:34.409 --> 00:36.244
- [Evie] I got this.
- Evie!

00:36.244 --> 00:38.329
How'd you know Evie?
She was my best friend.

00:38.329 --> 00:40.331
I almost died of congestive heart failure.

00:40.331 --> 00:43.334
- I needed a transplant. She was my donor.
- [Zimmer] You've been transferred.

00:43.334 --> 00:44.753
- [Saanvi] Ben!
- [Ben] Saanvi!

00:44.753 --> 00:46.880
They're ahead of us.
Saanvi's not the only scientist

00:46.880 --> 00:48.840
to figure out there's a volcano
under New York.

00:48.840 --> 00:51.843
Once my guards have cleared out,
passengers will get what they want.

00:51.843 --> 00:53.845
We can't leave them here.
These are human beings.

00:53.845 --> 00:55.430
The decision has been made.

00:55.430 --> 00:58.224
The whole point of no strings
is that it's never awkward.

00:58.224 --> 01:00.643
This...
This hasn't been a thing for a while.

01:00.643 --> 01:02.520
[Vance]
Here's the key to the ALNI patients.

01:02.520 --> 01:05.065
They were on life support.
They need special care.

01:05.065 --> 01:08.943
- I didn't get a Calling. I got all of 'em!
- We can still help solve the Callings.

01:08.943 --> 01:11.404
Giving you the chance
to survive the Death Date.

01:11.404 --> 01:15.658
- The red river, it leads to a volcano.
- The world's ending, and we know how.

01:21.289 --> 01:24.209
[woman] What's happening in New York
is consistent with what you're hearing

01:24.209 --> 01:26.628
from your intelligence counterparts
across the globe.

01:28.421 --> 01:31.424
Understood, Mrs. Secretary.
I'll see to it myself.

01:32.008 --> 01:34.135
If I'm not going home,
neither is the asset.

No matter what we do,
it's continuing to grow.

01:53.696 --> 01:55.949
[Saanvi] Of course it is.
I told you that it would.

01:57.534 --> 01:58.952
You're not working hard enough.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.412
The Secretary of Defense
created this lab for one reason.

02:01.412 --> 02:02.831
Yeah, yeah. To imprison me.

02:03.414 --> 02:07.377
You're not a prisoner.
You're an asset with valuable perspective.

02:07.377 --> 02:10.547
An asset that can't go anywhere.
I can't call anybody.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.841
I can't do anything
without cameras tracing my every move.

02:12.841 --> 02:15.385
We are facing an extinction-level event.

02:15.385 --> 02:19.139
The public has no idea
what the seismic activity portends.

02:19.139 --> 02:22.016
If we are to avoid mass panic,
they must never know.

02:22.016 --> 02:25.728
Know what? That unless the passengers
survive our final judgment,

02:25.728 --> 02:27.856
life as we know it will end in two days.

02:27.856 --> 02:31.776
Look, we know that whatever
or whyever this volcano is,

02:31.776 --> 02:34.404
it's reacting to signals
from the God frequency.

02:35.029 --> 02:37.157
Sorry, ultralow frequency.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.742
So it stands to reason
that if we could block the ULF,

02:39.742 --> 02:42.120
we could stop the volcano
from ultimately erupting.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.788
How would you block the ULF?

02:43.788 --> 02:45.999
By using an electromagnetic pulse?

02:45.999 --> 02:47.375
That's interesting.

02:48.626 --> 02:50.044
Let's get proof of concept.

02:52.130 --> 02:53.715
The black box emits ULF, no?

02:53.715 --> 02:56.384
See if an electromagnetic blast
would work on that.

02:56.384 --> 02:59.137
Troy, you'll wipe out all of our data.

02:59.137 --> 03:02.307
If the volcanoes around the world erupt,
what good will our data be?

03:02.307 --> 03:04.017
This could be our only hope.

All right, Cal. Let's hear it.
What's going on?

04:48.913 --> 04:50.832
Uh, Captain Amuta.

04:52.250 --> 04:57.171
I sat in your seat, and I saw some game
like boccie meets baseball.

04:57.171 --> 04:59.799
Cricket. I used to play,
growing up in Jamaica.

05:00.508 --> 05:04.554
There are cricket fields in Prospect Park.
My mom used to take me there all the time.

05:04.554 --> 05:07.098
Okay, great.
Since you're familiar with the area,

05:07.098 --> 05:09.684
why don't we fold Amuta
into your team for the day?

05:09.684 --> 05:11.853
[Ben] Be careful going out of the tunnel.

05:11.853 --> 05:15.315
And remember, if anyone IDs you
or thinks you're a passenger, you--

05:15.315 --> 05:17.734
Split up, take three different modes
of transportation back.

05:18.693 --> 05:20.903
[Cal] Uh, Mick, you also had one. Um...

"Every life is worth saving."
At least, I think that's what it said.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.243
It's okay. I'll figure it out.

Anyway, my sister's birthday
is just the half of it.

06:27.011 --> 06:29.180

Hopefully, it's enough.

07:09.971 --> 07:11.556

can cover for Henry at the lab.

07:13.891 --> 07:16.853

or something, but look here.

12:23.242 --> 12:26.370
- [Ben] What are those? They look like--
- [Vance] Solar panels. New ones too.

12:26.370 --> 12:28.414
See, according to this requisition form,

12:28.414 --> 12:30.916
looks like ConEd installed the panels
months ago.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.586
The buzzing sound in your Calling.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.588
It sounded like something high-voltage.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.047
High-voltage is right.

12:37.047 --> 12:40.092
These things are generating enough power
to light the Vegas strip.

12:40.092 --> 12:43.137
More power
than any one building would need.

12:43.137 --> 12:44.638
Especially an abandoned one.

12:44.638 --> 12:46.807
Yeah, I have a feeling
my Calling wants me to go here.

12:46.807 --> 12:48.726
- On my way.
- [Cal] Yeah, me too.

12:48.726 --> 12:51.729
Me three. If this is what I think,
you're gonna want me by your side.

12:52.938 --> 12:54.940
[phone ringing]

13:05.785 --> 13:08.746
Okay, Zeke, I have no idea
what's in store for me here,

13:08.746 --> 13:10.748
but you knew this space
better than anyone,

13:10.748 --> 13:15.503
so on the off chance you can hear me,
I could really use a sign.

13:18.297 --> 13:19.465
No? Okay.

13:32.520 --> 13:36.607
Okay, I know this might look silly,
but it works. Trust me.

13:37.107 --> 13:38.734
Uh-huh. According to who?

13:38.734 --> 13:39.693
Evie.

13:39.693 --> 13:40.861
Mmm.

13:40.861 --> 13:43.906
She wrote down all her problems on a note.

13:43.906 --> 13:47.076
Anything from high school boyfriends
to your mom.

13:47.952 --> 13:51.956
She'd read it out loud, and then
she attached the note to the balloon.

13:51.956 --> 13:53.165
She let it go.

13:54.291 --> 13:55.751
Unburdening herself.

13:56.460 --> 13:59.588
This isn't some high school dilemma.
It's Chloe.

13:59.588 --> 14:01.048
Zeke, if you don't free your mind,

14:01.048 --> 14:05.094
you're not gonna be able to help
your patients, your intern, anyone.

14:06.428 --> 14:07.388
You gotta just try.

14:07.972 --> 14:10.516
I'd feel more inclined to try this
if... if you did it with me.

14:11.225 --> 14:14.311
Maybe another day,
but today it's... it's about you.

14:16.105 --> 14:17.064
Come on.

14:18.357 --> 14:19.191
Read the note.

14:19.984 --> 14:20.818
You read it.

14:25.364 --> 14:29.243
"Chlo, I know I wasn't always
there for you the way I should've been,

14:30.160 --> 14:32.997
but somehow
you never held that against me."

14:35.165 --> 14:37.793
Zeke, come on. Please.

14:40.296 --> 14:45.092
"You were the brightest light.
The kindest heart. The gentlest soul."

14:45.092 --> 14:47.845
"You never showed me
anything less than love."

14:48.345 --> 14:50.723
[voice breaking] "A love
I took for granted until..."

14:50.723 --> 14:51.932
[whimpers]

14:51.932 --> 14:53.100
I can't.

14:55.227 --> 14:57.021
"Until you couldn't show me anymore."

14:58.564 --> 14:59.523
Hey.

15:04.445 --> 15:05.362
Okay.

15:12.119 --> 15:13.746
[inspirational music plays]

15:29.720 --> 15:31.889
Excuse me. Can I help you?

15:31.889 --> 15:34.642
- Uh, no, I was just looking--
- [woman] Oh my God.

15:35.225 --> 15:36.894
You're Zeke Landon's wife.

15:38.187 --> 15:40.397
How are you not in that detention center?

15:40.397 --> 15:43.651
No, no, no, please. Please don't call
the cops. I'm... I'm begging you.

15:43.651 --> 15:45.319
[suspenseful music swells]

15:48.030 --> 15:48.906
[sighs]

15:50.324 --> 15:51.742
All right, what is it?

15:52.826 --> 15:54.870
Something's bumming you out big time.

15:55.496 --> 15:57.748
Everything is bumming me out, Troy.

15:59.667 --> 16:02.044
This is something else.
Something specific.

16:02.044 --> 16:04.338
Like right now. You know I know you.

16:09.009 --> 16:11.971
Know what? Forget I asked.
Mind handing me that input cable?

16:14.348 --> 16:16.225
No. You know what? This is stupid.

16:16.225 --> 16:19.061
- Aha! I knew it!
- I'm serious. We have to get out of here.

16:19.061 --> 16:21.939
I suppose it is borderline cray-cray
to try and stop a volcano.

16:21.939 --> 16:24.566
No, there is no point
in trying to stop volcanoes

16:24.566 --> 16:27.403
if the divine doesn't want them
to be stopped.

16:27.403 --> 16:29.947
We need to figure out how passengers
can survive their judgment.

16:29.947 --> 16:32.741
We only have two fricking days left
to do that! Two!

16:32.741 --> 16:37.871
But that would mean breaking out
into hallways accessed by key cards.

16:37.871 --> 16:39.206
Cards we don't have.

16:39.707 --> 16:43.168
Hate to say it. If you want out,
we have to stop the volcano,

16:43.669 --> 16:45.546
which means testing that pulse.

16:48.215 --> 16:51.635
That pulse can wipe out
every electrical signal, right?

16:51.635 --> 16:53.762
- Saanvi? No.
- [Saanvi] Yes.

16:53.762 --> 16:56.932
If we can crank it to 11,
we can disable every camera, every lock.

16:56.932 --> 16:58.100
We can get out of here.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.435
We could get arrested.

16:59.435 --> 17:02.980
Do you wanna live the rest of your life
in fear or go out like a hero?

17:04.940 --> 17:05.983
We're doing it.

For one of the trusted members
of my flock? Always.

17:26.462 --> 17:30.841
Can we go somewhere more private?
It concerns another member of the flock.

If you don't want me to call the cops,
you gotta tell me why you're here.

18:15.135 --> 18:18.555
I just need to look around for a second.
I know that sounds really weird, but...

18:18.555 --> 18:21.391
You gotta go.
Oscar! Oscar, a little help here!

18:22.226 --> 18:24.019
You heard her. She said go.

for one second, please.

[mysterious music plays]

Find what we're looking for
before the bad guys catch us.

[Jared] The only thing I found
is that we were right about Astrid.

19:46.351 --> 19:48.020
There's gotta be something else going on.

Hey, uh, speaking of,

19:51.440 --> 19:53.901
I'd hate myself if I made things awkward.

Awkward?

For you and Mick?

19:57.529 --> 20:00.991
This thing,
it was supposed to be no strings.

20:00.991 --> 20:03.327
It was until I saw
you had one hell of a string.

20:03.327 --> 20:05.370
Yeah, but you weren't the only one
who saw.

20:05.871 --> 20:08.457
You can't tell me this last month
has been easy for Mick.

Who can blame her?
This is a crazy situation that we're in.

Drea, I don't know. If we can just make it
through the next couple of days,

20:14.630 --> 20:16.298
there's no doubt in my mind

20:16.298 --> 20:19.051
that we all are going to be able
to navigate this situation together.

- I don't hear anything.
- Exactly.

No sirens. No flashing lights.

21:38.463 --> 21:40.716
The only thing between us
and whatever's inside

21:40.716 --> 21:42.551
is this simple steel door.

This should be all the data we need.

Four numbers. One, one, two, one.

It wasn't so long ago when you showed me
that my life was worth living.

23:08.470 --> 23:09.638
What?

23:09.638 --> 23:13.308
Nothing. I, um, just can't get that phrase
out of my head today.

23:13.308 --> 23:15.143
It's more than a phrase here.

23:15.143 --> 23:17.604
- Yeah.
- This is why I was drawn to this place.

- You sound like my husband.

He taught me everything.

23:27.072 --> 23:28.031
You're Zeke's intern.

23:28.907 --> 23:30.867
He talked about you all the time.

23:30.867 --> 23:31.993
You too.

23:31.993 --> 23:37.165
Zeke always said you were his rock,
his North Star, his Gemini.

23:38.250 --> 23:41.503
There's nothing more important than
helping others, than making a connection.

23:45.132 --> 23:47.634
When my wife and I met,
we stumbled upon this petrograph,

23:47.634 --> 23:49.886
and it spoke to us.

23:50.971 --> 23:52.139
And from that moment on,

23:52.139 --> 23:55.100
we've supported each other
and held each other up.

23:56.351 --> 23:58.019
Without my wife, without Gemini,

23:59.146 --> 24:00.439
I wouldn't be here today,

24:01.982 --> 24:04.818
'cause there was a moment
when I thought life wasn't worth living,

24:05.360 --> 24:08.697
and she reached across space and time
to... to help me realize

24:08.697 --> 24:12.075
that it's not just my life
that's worth living, but every life.

24:13.243 --> 24:14.202
Every single one.

24:15.162 --> 24:16.663
I got something to show you.

24:31.553 --> 24:35.557
We've been together a long time,
brothers and sisters, waiting for this.

24:35.557 --> 24:38.185
The righteous end to our wicked world.

24:38.977 --> 24:43.356
Many of you have shown me your faith,
and yet we are still one too many.

24:44.733 --> 24:46.443
So I must ask.

24:48.653 --> 24:51.823
Have you been faithful, brother Paul?
Do you believe?

24:59.456 --> 25:00.916
And you, brother Eagan?

25:13.303 --> 25:15.472
Are you praying for salvation?

25:16.932 --> 25:18.600
I'm praying you'll say yes.

25:21.686 --> 25:24.731
When this world comes crashing down
and you're standing there,

25:25.774 --> 25:27.734
you're not gonna want
to be standing there alone.

25:28.443 --> 25:31.488
And the truth is,
I don't wanna be alone either.

25:31.488 --> 25:33.323
We're both broken souls.

25:34.574 --> 25:35.575
But maybe,

25:36.785 --> 25:38.245
as crazy as it sounds,

25:39.454 --> 25:40.664
we could come together,

25:41.540 --> 25:42.666
comfort each other.

25:43.375 --> 25:44.584
So I'm asking you

25:45.961 --> 25:48.463
from one broken-hearted person to another.

25:50.465 --> 25:52.259
Be the other half of my heart?

[mysterious music plays]

- Yes. Yeah.
- Yeah?

[clapping]

26:26.334 --> 26:27.460
Oh my God!

26:27.961 --> 26:31.798
Oh my God. I can't believe you're here.
I thought I'd never see you again.

26:31.798 --> 26:33.383
I didn't know where they'd taken you.

26:33.383 --> 26:35.468
You've been cooped up
in this place for nine months?

26:35.468 --> 26:36.636
It's a long story.

26:37.512 --> 26:40.765
- How'd you know we were here?
- I didn't. A Calling did.

26:41.891 --> 26:44.227
No, but we lost our Calling.

26:44.227 --> 26:46.980
No, no, we just lost our ability
to receive them.

26:47.564 --> 26:49.899
But not Cal. He can access all of them.

26:49.899 --> 26:52.777
Over the past month, dozens of us
have been sneaking out of the DC,

26:52.777 --> 26:54.029
solving them one by one.

26:54.029 --> 26:56.656
[Vance] Wanna solve any more,
we should get the hell out of here.

26:56.656 --> 26:59.200
- It's only a matter of time--
- [footsteps approaching]

26:59.200 --> 27:00.452
Guards.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.078
This way. Quick!

27:03.371 --> 27:04.372
[Ben] Go, go, go, go!

27:12.797 --> 27:14.674
Oh my God. Is this...

27:14.674 --> 27:17.594
After Zeke left, I found that in his desk.

27:17.594 --> 27:21.348

If you're getting any ideas, don't.

42:44.311 --> 42:47.815
First, we must lead the flock
past end times.

42:47.815 --> 42:52.528
Then we can focus
on the Godly task of repopulation.

42:53.696 --> 42:54.572
[chuckles]

42:55.239 --> 42:56.073
[clears throat]

42:56.991 --> 43:01.328
Actually, I was, uh,
kind of thinking of depopulation.

43:02.413 --> 43:03.497
There were ten.

43:04.623 --> 43:07.501
Now there's nine,
and soon there'll be eight.

43:08.836 --> 43:12.506
Just makes me wonder
whatever happened to Astrid.

43:14.883 --> 43:16.302
She didn't make the cut.

43:16.844 --> 43:19.597
So she met her judgment on God's time.

43:21.557 --> 43:24.810
But I'm glad you proved yourself worthy.
You almost didn't.

43:24.810 --> 43:26.395
[both chuckle]

43:31.734 --> 43:33.319
[knocking]

43:33.819 --> 43:35.821

43:45.164 --> 43:47.249
What are you doing here?
I told you not to come.

43:47.249 --> 43:50.169
It can't wait any longer.

43:56.675 --> 43:58.677
[beeping]

43:58.677 --> 44:00.763
