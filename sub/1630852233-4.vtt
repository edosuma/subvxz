WEBVTT

00:01.251 --> 00:04.004
Okay, let's move on to "ard."
Ard.

00:04.004 --> 00:05.630
Right, which means "all right."

00:05.714 --> 00:08.550
So, the kids here use
a lot of Philadelphia slang,

00:08.550 --> 00:10.510
or as we call it,
"Philly slang."

00:10.510 --> 00:13.722
So I like to incorporate it
as sight words,

00:13.722 --> 00:15.515
which are words that
kids recognize

00:15.515 --> 00:17.142
without sounding them out.

00:17.142 --> 00:19.644
For instance,
"boul" means "boy,"

00:19.728 --> 00:21.354
so I'd say like,

00:21.438 --> 00:23.356
"Ooh, I have a crush on boul."

00:23.440 --> 00:26.359
Or, <i>Boul Meets World</i>
is my favorite show.

00:26.443 --> 00:29.279
"Cheesesteak."
Cheesesteak.

00:29.279 --> 00:30.530
And let's go to "boul."

00:30.530 --> 00:32.323
Boul.

00:32.407 --> 00:34.242
Right. Sometimes it's spelled
B-U-L, which is interesting.

00:34.242 --> 00:35.827
What is going on
in this classroom?

00:35.827 --> 00:37.579
Hey, Mrs. Howard.

00:37.579 --> 00:39.289
I'm just teaching the kids
some sight words.

00:41.166 --> 00:45.879
It's a helpful teaching tool,
because these kids use these --

00:45.879 --> 00:48.715
Jawns.
- ...jawns all the time.

00:48.715 --> 00:50.425
You're abandoning
the phonics principle

00:50.425 --> 00:52.552
that these children need.

00:52.552 --> 00:55.305
This is a classroom,
not a hoagie stand.

00:55.305 --> 00:56.973
Oh, boom. Hoagie.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.600
Hoagie.

00:58.600 --> 01:02.103
We had it on the board, so...

01:02.187 --> 01:03.646
Hm.

01:05.190 --> 01:06.399
Okay, kids.

01:06.483 --> 01:09.194
Let us move on to
"oldhead," one word.

01:09.194 --> 01:10.987
Oldhead.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.697
Young bouls are
so disrespectful.

01:12.781 --> 01:13.740
Mm.

01:26.211 --> 01:28.171
They said that --
Oh, they do. Look.

01:28.171 --> 01:29.464
Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:29.464 --> 01:31.424
What it do,
Abbott teaching crew?

01:31.508 --> 01:33.009
Damn, the last time
I was up this early

01:33.093 --> 01:34.636
was to cuss out the mailman.

01:34.636 --> 01:36.304
I don't need
all them bills coming.

01:36.388 --> 01:38.556
Uh, I thought breakfast
was being provided.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.225
Don't act like you don't see
these little boxes of cereal

01:40.225 --> 01:41.643
right here.

01:41.643 --> 01:43.395
So, listen up.

01:43.395 --> 01:46.022
Your favorite HBIC, AKA me,

01:46.106 --> 01:48.441
has acquired some
new learning technology

01:48.525 --> 01:50.402
that will help our little ones
with their reading.

01:50.402 --> 01:51.861
Well, the school district
mandated it.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.571
It's a city-wide push.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.240
What are you doing here?

01:55.240 --> 01:56.783
This isn't for
6th through 8th grade teachers.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.034
I'm just here for
the camaraderie,

01:58.118 --> 02:00.036
and this tasty breakfast.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.622
You guys, I have been
reading up on this,

02:02.706 --> 02:05.333
and our students are gonna get
a huge boost

02:05.417 --> 02:06.584
from this software.

02:06.668 --> 02:07.836
I mean, our kids
are gonna be reading

02:07.836 --> 02:09.379
at the speed of light.

02:09.379 --> 02:10.839
Well, I, for one, prefer
the tried and true methods

02:10.839 --> 02:13.133
over whatever the latest
doohickey is.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.218
I mean, I have yet to see
the program

02:15.218 --> 02:18.930
that can do what I do
by, you know, teaching.

02:19.014 --> 02:22.892
Well,
old-school teaching is great,

02:22.976 --> 02:25.770
but the latest doohickey
can be a helpful addition.

02:25.854 --> 02:27.564
Yeah, tech has its place.

02:27.564 --> 02:29.816
Like when you haven't been
with a man for a few years.

02:31.776 --> 02:34.279
Um, are subs gonna
have to do this?

02:34.279 --> 02:36.239
I thought I'd mainly be
showing Pixar movies.

02:36.239 --> 02:39.242
You guys, all I'm saying is,
we should keep an open mind.

02:39.242 --> 02:41.494
There was a great website
called AtoZOneTwoThree

02:41.578 --> 02:43.288
that taught me how to read
when I was a kid.

02:43.288 --> 02:45.290
My parents certainly
weren't around to do it.

02:45.290 --> 02:48.251
I had to potty-train myself.

02:48.335 --> 02:50.086
Overshare.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.213
Well, I do not need
some young Zuckerburn --

02:52.297 --> 02:53.631
Zuckerberg.

02:53.715 --> 02:56.009
Pimple-faced kid
fresh from the Smart Bar --

02:56.009 --> 02:58.345
- Genius Bar.
- ...telling me how to teach!

02:58.345 --> 03:00.138
Good morning.

03:00.138 --> 03:01.514
You're the tech teacher?

03:01.598 --> 03:02.849
Sure am.

03:02.849 --> 03:05.101
Can't keep us old folks down,
right?

03:05.185 --> 03:07.020
All right, what I'm
providing you with today

03:07.020 --> 03:08.938
will revolutionize
your classrooms.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.982
It not only helps in
teaching students how to read,

03:11.066 --> 03:13.318
it delivers up-to-the-minute
data on their progress

03:13.318 --> 03:15.737
that will be analyzed
at the end of each day.

03:15.737 --> 03:17.739
And the better the results,
the more funding we get,

03:17.739 --> 03:19.282
- so this is good, y'all.
- Mm-hmm.

03:19.366 --> 03:20.700
Each of you will
get one of these.

03:20.784 --> 03:21.951
New tablets!

03:22.035 --> 03:23.578
Yeah!

03:24.412 --> 03:27.791
Okay, who do you got to bang
to get into the analytics annex?

03:27.791 --> 03:30.502
It's really very easy.

03:30.502 --> 03:31.920
Just use the highlight tool

03:31.920 --> 03:33.713
to pinpoint
the pronunciation mistakes,

03:33.797 --> 03:36.383
create a word cloud,
output a ranks list,

03:36.383 --> 03:39.344
see the percentage of your
students that missed that word,

03:39.344 --> 03:41.346
and that'll determine whether
it becomes a "TAI,"

03:41.346 --> 03:43.306
or "Targeted Area
for Improvement."

03:43.390 --> 03:44.766
- Easy-peasy, keep it breezy!
- Oh.

03:47.352 --> 03:48.937
Hey. How's it going, Barb?

03:48.937 --> 03:51.731
- Oh. Easy-peasy.
- Mm-hmm.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.318
Yeah, sure.

03:55.402 --> 03:58.029
I am so excited
that Barbara is so confused,

03:58.113 --> 04:00.782
because it means I get to
help her with something.

04:00.782 --> 04:02.409
I need her help every day,

04:02.409 --> 04:03.993
so if I can return the favor
just once,

04:04.077 --> 04:05.370
it means I'm no longer
a newbie --

04:05.370 --> 04:06.788
I'm her peer.

04:08.039 --> 04:11.751
Gregory. Broseph. Brotato.

04:11.835 --> 04:14.170
Yeah, I'm still, uh --
still finding that.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.006
What's up, man? I'm just looking
for some creamer.

04:16.006 --> 04:17.257
Listen, you're the new guy here.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.883
I've been here a month.

04:18.967 --> 04:21.011
I am the second-year vet.
I figured I would, you know,

04:21.011 --> 04:23.096
show you a few things
around here.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.639
No, I'm just, uh, looking for --

04:24.723 --> 04:27.017
So, we've got
Ms. Cooper over there.

04:27.017 --> 04:28.393
I've been here
a year and a half.

04:28.393 --> 04:29.853
She's been pregnant
the whole time.

04:29.853 --> 04:31.187
I don't ask questions.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.814
I'll even take powdered creamer.

04:32.814 --> 04:34.190
That's Mrs. Robertson.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.359
Watch out,
she will talk your ear off.

04:36.443 --> 04:39.154
And, uh, oh, you know Melissa,
of course.

04:39.154 --> 04:42.198
She's, uh -- you know,
the Southern Philly type.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.534
'Scuse me?

04:44.534 --> 04:46.244
You talking about me?

04:46.244 --> 04:47.495
Yeah, uh -- I was --

04:47.579 --> 04:49.664
I was saying you are a, uh --

04:49.748 --> 04:51.332
a -- a Southern Philly Type.

04:51.416 --> 04:53.335
<i>- South</i> Philly.
- Right. Right.

04:53.335 --> 04:54.878
That's what I said. Right.

04:54.878 --> 04:56.671
Honestly, it's like --
it's like the best part

04:56.755 --> 04:58.381
of our beautiful city.

04:58.465 --> 05:00.884
I love how you guys
will just, like, park anywhere.

05:00.884 --> 05:02.635
Yeah, okay.

05:02.719 --> 05:04.262
You know, I'm actually
teaching a lesson right now

05:04.346 --> 05:05.680
about the unions in the city

05:05.764 --> 05:07.849
and how many of them
started in South Philly.

05:07.849 --> 05:09.184
Oh, no way.

05:09.184 --> 05:10.643
I know some guys
that were part of that.

05:11.853 --> 05:13.897
I'm glad you're
teaching that to the kids.

05:14.939 --> 05:16.733
Good job.

05:19.444 --> 05:21.237
Just like I said...

05:21.321 --> 05:25.033
she is a shady lady. Mm.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.659
That's why you and me,
we got to stick together, man.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.953
You know?
Like coffee and creamer.

05:31.456 --> 05:32.916
All right, in.

05:34.376 --> 05:36.795
Ugh. Teach the children
to read with this?

05:36.795 --> 05:38.797
I can hardly read this.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.678
Now, who took
that picture of me?

05:44.678 --> 05:46.096
Barbara.

05:46.096 --> 05:48.306
Oh, sorry.

05:48.390 --> 05:50.725
Hey, how's it going
with the new program?

05:50.809 --> 05:53.103
Oh, it's, uh,
a little hard to understand,

05:53.103 --> 05:54.729
but I'm getting
the hang of it.

05:54.813 --> 05:56.564
Okay, yeah.

05:56.648 --> 05:59.275
Just wanted to check in
in case this was tricky for you.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.527
You know,
I grew up with this stuff

06:00.527 --> 06:01.903
- and it gets me sometimes.
- Okay.

06:01.903 --> 06:04.364
I somehow lost my crypto wallet.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.116
But you come from
a different generation,

06:06.116 --> 06:08.159
and so it would be
totally understandable

06:08.243 --> 06:09.911
if you were
having trouble with it.

06:09.911 --> 06:11.246
Are you kidding me?

06:11.246 --> 06:13.498
I'm Miss Tech, you know.
I love tech.

06:13.498 --> 06:16.292
Shop at the App Store.
Got a Hotmail.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.086
I once even rode in a Tesla.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.755
I'm already ahead on
the first couple of lessons.

06:20.839 --> 06:22.007
- Wow.
- Yeah.

06:22.007 --> 06:23.633
Well, that's great. Can I see?

06:23.717 --> 06:25.468
- No.
- Oh.

06:25.552 --> 06:28.471
Janine,
you're disturbing my students.

06:28.555 --> 06:29.931
I'm -- I'm whispering.

06:30.015 --> 06:31.182
It's just your...

06:31.266 --> 06:32.767
overall presence,

06:32.851 --> 06:35.895
so if you wouldn't mind
just excusing yourself?

06:35.979 --> 06:39.524
I'm a little behind
on my Hotmail correspondences.

06:39.524 --> 06:41.317
Okay.

06:41.401 --> 06:45.155
Barbara says she's doing well,
but this program is really hard.

06:45.155 --> 06:47.532
She just has a ton of pride,

06:47.532 --> 06:51.327
so I'm gonna wait for her
to come and ask me for help.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.621
Oh, I can't wait.

06:53.705 --> 06:56.833
And that is how union
and non-union workers

06:56.833 --> 06:58.710
came together and worked as one

06:58.710 --> 07:04.257
to help solve the labor crisis
in South Philly, okay?

07:04.341 --> 07:06.760
All right,
we are going to have to

07:06.760 --> 07:10.138
grab a noun from
the Noun Pool --

07:10.138 --> 07:12.599
I don't get this.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.392
Sweetheart, neither do I.

07:14.476 --> 07:16.436
Okay, so here's what
I'm going to do.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.730
I'm going to continue teaching
my students how to read

07:18.730 --> 07:21.232
like I have been for 30 years.

07:21.316 --> 07:25.236
I'll input whatever information
I need to into that program,

07:25.320 --> 07:27.489
and then I'll just keep doing
what I have been doing,

07:27.489 --> 07:31.326
and everybody else
will just have to back off.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.163
Hey, Hill.

07:35.163 --> 07:36.790
That lesson, that was garbage.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.249
- That's not what happened.
- Okay, well,

07:38.333 --> 07:39.668
I've read several books
on the subject.

07:39.668 --> 07:42.087
I think I know the history
of the lesson.

07:42.087 --> 07:44.047
Well, me and my family <i>lived</i> it,
so I think we know the history.

07:44.047 --> 07:45.548
I've also listened to
several podcasts.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.300
Look, how about this?

07:47.384 --> 07:49.219
I know a guy who was actually
a captain back in the day.

07:49.219 --> 07:51.012
How about I hook you up,
he can come to the class

07:51.096 --> 07:53.181
and do like an eyewitness
account for the kids?

07:54.724 --> 07:57.018
Unexpected, but I am so happy

07:57.102 --> 07:58.603
Melissa's bringing in
a police captain.

07:58.687 --> 07:59.979
He's gonna be able
to talk to the kids

08:00.063 --> 08:01.564
about how this is done
peacefully.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.817
I'm just really happy Vinny,
the strike captain,

08:03.817 --> 08:05.485
is out of jail
so he can do this.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.654
It's also gonna count towards
his community service.

08:07.654 --> 08:10.907
Just 100 more hours,
and his record's cleared.

08:10.907 --> 08:13.034
Good morning.

08:13.118 --> 08:14.619
Come on down.

08:14.703 --> 08:15.912
You ready for a good day?

08:15.912 --> 08:17.497
That's what I'm talking about.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.457
<i>Morning,
Abbott Elementarians!</i>

08:19.541 --> 08:22.460
<i>It turns out one of our
teachers is just too good!</i>

08:22.544 --> 08:24.421
<i>According to
our new reading program,</i>

08:24.421 --> 08:26.089
<i>Mrs. Howard's kindergartners
are reading</i>

08:26.089 --> 08:28.466
<i>- at a 4th grade level!</i>
- No.

08:28.550 --> 08:31.553
<i>Mrs. Howard, you are,
once again, that girl.</i>

08:31.553 --> 08:32.971
Barbara?

08:32.971 --> 08:37.225
No. No. No. Okay. Thank you.

08:37.225 --> 08:38.476
No. Okay, that's enough.

08:38.560 --> 08:40.854
When I say "Mrs.,"
you say "Howard."

08:40.854 --> 08:42.230
Mrs...
Howard!

08:42.230 --> 08:43.648
- Mrs...
- Howard!

08:43.732 --> 08:46.901
- Mrs...
- Howard!

08:49.988 --> 08:52.157
Hey, Barbara.

08:52.157 --> 08:54.242
I just wanted to say that
I'm sorry.

08:54.242 --> 08:56.327
You clearly knew
what you were doing,

08:56.411 --> 08:59.873
and I arrogantly assumed --
or hoped, rather --

08:59.873 --> 09:03.126
that you would need my help,
but once again, I need yours.

09:03.126 --> 09:06.046
You are officially Yoda
with better edges.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.673
Okay, which one of you
Young Sheldons

09:08.757 --> 09:10.008
is gonna get me to Mars

09:10.008 --> 09:11.509
witcha little smart
reading selves?

09:11.593 --> 09:13.678
There's actually no need
for all of this.

09:13.762 --> 09:15.305
I'm just doing my job.

09:15.305 --> 09:16.598
But don't forget,
it was your girl

09:16.598 --> 09:18.141
that brought in
that dope program.

09:18.141 --> 09:19.976
Oh, my God. Look at me,
not even taking credit

09:20.060 --> 09:22.228
for something I had
so much to do with.

09:22.312 --> 09:25.899
Barbara, you know what?
Since so many of us need help,

09:25.899 --> 09:27.692
what if you put on, like,
a little presentation

09:27.776 --> 09:29.110
for the rest of us?

09:29.194 --> 09:30.570
You're thinking too small,
Janine.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.197
We should have an assembly
and have

09:32.197 --> 09:34.115
one of Barbara's students read
to the whole school.

09:34.199 --> 09:36.117
Show these little illiterate
fools how to literate.

09:36.201 --> 09:38.036
Yes! Not the second part. Yes!

09:38.036 --> 09:39.412
Okay.

09:39.496 --> 09:41.206
We can have Khalil read.

09:41.206 --> 09:42.665
No, not Khalil.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.334
Everybody knows
that little dork can read.

09:44.334 --> 09:46.711
I was thinking him.
Whoo-hoo!

09:49.214 --> 09:51.383
5 years old,
reading at a 4th grade level?

09:51.383 --> 09:53.635
You performed a damn miracle
on that boy.

09:55.220 --> 09:56.471
That was a pretty tough time
for me --

09:56.471 --> 09:58.139
Hey. He's here.
He's on his way in.

09:58.223 --> 09:59.516
Oh. Oh.
That's fantastic, Melissa.

09:59.516 --> 10:00.934
Okay, let me, um,
set him up for the --

10:00.934 --> 10:02.394
Uh, students.

10:02.394 --> 10:06.147
We are about to hear from
a heroic, upstanding

10:06.231 --> 10:07.982
citizen of this city, okay,
who helped to peacefully end

10:08.066 --> 10:09.359
one of --

10:09.359 --> 10:11.945
Kids, meet Vinny Romano.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.863
Call me The Tire Iron.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.536
Uh, hello, Mr. Iron.

10:19.536 --> 10:23.039
Um, is there anything else
we could call you?

10:23.123 --> 10:24.916
Nope.

10:27.752 --> 10:29.337
Okay, come on now. Here we go.

10:29.421 --> 10:31.756
I don't think Will is
ready to read just yet,

10:31.840 --> 10:33.800
but I have read from this book
so many times,

10:33.800 --> 10:36.177
he practically has it memorized.

10:36.261 --> 10:38.513
I'm sure he'll have no problem.

10:38.513 --> 10:41.766
- "Jack...and... Jill..."
- Yes.

10:41.850 --> 10:45.603
- "...went up the..."
- The.

10:45.687 --> 10:51.192
Okay, Will,
it's your name with an "H."

10:51.276 --> 10:52.485
Hilliam!

10:52.569 --> 10:54.362
No.

10:54.446 --> 10:56.823
Barbara, can I borrow
some gold stars?

10:56.823 --> 10:58.324
I gave all mine out
this morning.

10:58.408 --> 10:59.993
My kids are amazing.
Uh, I'll even take red.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.327
Oh, sure.

11:01.411 --> 11:02.954
Thank you.

11:03.038 --> 11:06.082
Oh, well, if it isn't Abbott's
brightest little reader.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.168
Are you excited to
show the school your skills?

11:08.168 --> 11:10.086
Yeah?

11:13.882 --> 11:16.801
- Here you go.
- Hmm.

11:16.885 --> 11:19.012
- Is he okay?
- Oh, he's fine.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.805
This child has just
gained entry

11:20.889 --> 11:22.766
into the magical world
of books,

11:22.766 --> 11:26.394
so please, Janine,
allow him time to celebrate.

11:26.478 --> 11:28.897
Okay. Yeah.

11:28.897 --> 11:30.398
Good morning, kids.

11:32.650 --> 11:34.819
Good morning to you all,
as well.

11:37.489 --> 11:38.698
Subbing here has been...

11:38.782 --> 11:39.949
fine.

11:41.618 --> 11:43.453
I haven't even gotten past
teaching the kids my name,

11:43.453 --> 11:45.455
let alone that
confusing reading program.

11:45.455 --> 11:47.832
I'm hoping once they learn
those things,

11:47.916 --> 11:50.001
then we can just
start watching movies.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.505
- Hey, Gregory.
- Hey.

11:53.505 --> 11:54.839
Hi.

11:54.923 --> 11:56.758
Um, how are you settling in?

11:56.758 --> 11:58.009
- It's going well.
- Yeah?

11:58.093 --> 11:59.844
I'm figuring out
where everything is,

11:59.928 --> 12:02.222
- who everyone is.
- Yeah. Well, I'm Janine.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.516
That I know.

12:05.934 --> 12:08.144
Hmm...

12:09.396 --> 12:11.272
Uh, my gosh.
How are you doing

12:11.356 --> 12:12.649
with this
new reading program?

12:12.649 --> 12:14.109
Oh. I'm not gonna lie.

12:14.109 --> 12:15.402
It's got me even more confused

12:15.402 --> 12:17.112
than I already was
teaching here.

12:17.112 --> 12:19.531
I cannot get past a single
lesson without an error message.

12:19.531 --> 12:21.825
- It's really annoying.
- Why don't we get together

12:21.825 --> 12:23.201
- after school...
- Mm-hmm.

12:23.201 --> 12:24.494
...and we can figure it out?

12:24.494 --> 12:27.372
Um, I would love that.

12:27.372 --> 12:28.790
You kidding me?

12:28.790 --> 12:30.083
Oh, my God, but, shoot.
My boyfriend

12:30.083 --> 12:31.584
is picking me up
after school today.

12:31.668 --> 12:32.961
- Oh.
- You know what?

12:32.961 --> 12:34.212
You can come hang with us.

12:34.212 --> 12:35.880
I mean,
we're just going to IKEA.

12:35.964 --> 12:37.674
You can help us pick out a bed.

12:37.674 --> 12:40.301
Oh, okay. Yeah, um...

12:40.385 --> 12:42.095
Oh, God. Um...

12:42.095 --> 12:43.596
I actually have somebody
picking me up after school.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.056
- Oh.
- She's a girl...

12:45.140 --> 12:46.516
- Oh.
- She's a woman, I mean.

12:46.516 --> 12:47.851
Like, it's a car
full of women and...

12:47.851 --> 12:50.061
What?

12:50.145 --> 12:52.105
Nothing.

12:52.105 --> 12:55.525
Oh. Okay, well, see you later.
I'll see you around school.

12:55.525 --> 12:56.901
Yeah, yeah. All right, you, too.

12:56.985 --> 12:58.403
Hey, enjoy the bed.

12:58.403 --> 13:00.280
- Oh, we will.
- Ha!

13:00.280 --> 13:02.115
Uh, I was just kidding.
But see you later!

13:02.115 --> 13:04.200
- Uh-huh.
- Bye.

13:05.285 --> 13:08.538
So hundreds of us
come piling off this bus, right?

13:08.538 --> 13:10.331
And the punk firefighters,

13:10.415 --> 13:12.417
they didn't even show their
pretty little faces, you know?

13:12.417 --> 13:15.712
And the pigs, they were mad
'cause we were throwing rocks.

13:15.712 --> 13:17.589
It's like, hey, just relax.

13:17.589 --> 13:18.965
They're just freakin' rocks,
you know?

13:20.550 --> 13:22.719
So, anyway, we tell that, uh,
lousy, stinkin'...

13:22.719 --> 13:24.179
He's great, right?

13:24.179 --> 13:25.972
Why did you bring him here?

13:26.056 --> 13:28.141
- Uh, didn't we agree to this?
- I thought you were bringing

13:28.141 --> 13:30.268
a <i>police</i> captain.

13:30.352 --> 13:31.936
Someone to talk about how the
union worked together in peace?

13:32.020 --> 13:33.563
That's not the real story.
This is the truth.

13:33.563 --> 13:35.815
He's giving them an
eyewitness account to history.

13:35.899 --> 13:38.151
Eyewitness? I think
the term is "accomplice."

13:38.151 --> 13:40.362
This is the problem I have
with people like you.

13:40.362 --> 13:41.946
You want to romanticize
this city,

13:42.030 --> 13:43.615
but you won't acknowledge
the truth.

13:43.615 --> 13:44.991
Like, you want to run up
the Rocky steps,

13:45.075 --> 13:46.951
but you can't take
a punch in the face.

13:47.035 --> 13:48.411
I can take a punch in the face.

13:48.495 --> 13:49.871
What -- What --
What are you saying?

13:49.871 --> 13:52.165
I'm some kind of, like,
hipster poseur?

13:52.165 --> 13:55.418
Look, I care, okay?
I am here, teaching, every day.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.587
No, I'm saying you can't
teach the kids right

13:57.671 --> 13:59.631
if you don't respect
where they're from.

13:59.631 --> 14:01.257
It's about respect.

14:03.385 --> 14:05.178
Me and the rest of the class
are going on strike

14:05.178 --> 14:07.180
until there are no more
pop quizzes.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.394
Lights.

14:14.062 --> 14:16.856
We are here to celebrate
Barbara's genius kindergartners.

14:16.940 --> 14:19.567
This is a tremendous opportunity
for this school.

14:19.651 --> 14:22.612
Before we begin, I would like
to detail all the ways

14:22.696 --> 14:24.948
that I personally
made this happen.

14:24.948 --> 14:26.533
It all started when I was
watching <i>Coach Carter</i>

14:26.533 --> 14:28.159
for the 17th time. Now...
Jack fell down

14:28.243 --> 14:30.995
and broke his crown,
and Jill came tumbling after.

14:31.079 --> 14:32.247
Perfect!

14:32.247 --> 14:34.666
Now, when we get up on stage,

14:34.666 --> 14:38.128
you're gonna do it
just like that, okay?

14:38.128 --> 14:40.588
No. And no dancing.

14:40.672 --> 14:43.842
But that's what I do,
Ms. Howard!

14:43.842 --> 14:45.218
Hey, Mrs. Howard.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.845
Hey, after the assembly,

14:46.845 --> 14:49.055
do you think you can
come help me with the program?

14:49.139 --> 14:50.849
My kids are struggling,

14:50.849 --> 14:52.100
and I know I ask you for help
all the time,

14:52.100 --> 14:53.351
but what can I say?

14:53.435 --> 14:54.602
You're the best.

14:54.686 --> 14:56.354
- Janine --
- Sometimes I wonder

14:56.438 --> 14:57.647
if I put you
on too high a pedestal,

14:57.731 --> 14:59.149
but then I think
it's not high enough.

14:59.149 --> 15:01.401
I say, "Janine,
she's just a person like you --"

15:01.401 --> 15:02.652
Anyway...
- You know what?

15:02.736 --> 15:05.196
I'm sorry, I'm rambling.
You make --

15:05.280 --> 15:06.656
I'm sorry.

15:06.740 --> 15:08.992
You make me want to be
a better teacher.

15:11.494 --> 15:12.829
Okay.

15:12.829 --> 15:14.998
I'm starting to
forget the words.

15:14.998 --> 15:16.750
Oh, gotta go!

15:16.750 --> 15:18.293
Like, look at this guy
get a whole movie about him.

15:18.293 --> 15:20.003
I've done more for this school
in one year

15:20.003 --> 15:21.671
than he did for the whole movie,
so I --

15:21.755 --> 15:24.257
Okay, thank you.
Oh, I guess it's time to go.

15:24.341 --> 15:26.009
That kid's a reading fool.

15:26.009 --> 15:28.386
Good afternoon, Abbott.

15:28.470 --> 15:33.058
My student, William,
will be reading <i>Jack and Jill.</i>

15:33.058 --> 15:35.268
Oh! Change of plans.

15:35.352 --> 15:37.312
My copy of Michelle Obama's
book just came in,

15:37.312 --> 15:40.106
and since Will reads at
a 4th grade level,

15:40.190 --> 15:42.067
- that shouldn't be a problem.
- Oh, no. I really think

15:42.067 --> 15:43.902
that Will
would prefer to read --

15:43.902 --> 15:45.445
Don't nobody want to hear about
pails and water and whatnot.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.405
We want to hear what
"Michelle O" got to say.

15:47.489 --> 15:48.990
I hope there's
a section in there

15:49.074 --> 15:51.159
about her meet cute
with my man, Barry Hussein.

15:51.159 --> 15:52.786
All right.

15:55.789 --> 16:00.418
Okay. Here goes.

16:02.170 --> 16:05.048
Okay, that's enough.

16:05.048 --> 16:07.884
Everybody, um,
my student, Will,

16:07.884 --> 16:12.347
is a wonderful student
and dancer,

16:12.347 --> 16:15.350
but he cannot read this book
just yet.

16:15.350 --> 16:18.937
The truth is, I was actually
able to log into the program,

16:18.937 --> 16:21.773
but, um, I was just
pushing buttons.

16:21.773 --> 16:23.525
I did not mean to say

16:23.525 --> 16:27.070
that they could read
at a 4th grade level.

16:27.070 --> 16:30.740
I know how to
teach these kids how to read.

16:30.824 --> 16:33.827
I just can't use that program.

16:35.453 --> 16:37.330
So I lied.

16:39.249 --> 16:42.002
I can't believe Barbara
lied to me.

16:43.086 --> 16:45.088
Normally, I encourage cheating,
but, girl,

16:45.088 --> 16:46.965
you gots to let me know.

16:46.965 --> 16:48.591
Barbara. Who would have thought?

16:49.884 --> 16:54.222
Hey, Barbara. Another great
Abbott Elementary assembly.

16:56.266 --> 16:57.976
Um...

16:57.976 --> 17:00.854
Why wouldn't you
let me help you?

17:00.854 --> 17:02.814
I was handling it
the best way I could.

17:02.814 --> 17:05.108
By lying instead of
letting me help you?

17:05.108 --> 17:06.860
That is not what this is about.

17:06.860 --> 17:09.195
Then what is it about?
Because I don't get it.

17:12.198 --> 17:16.786
I am good at this job,
and I know how to do it well,

17:16.870 --> 17:19.789
but admitting that I couldn't
figure this program out,

17:19.873 --> 17:23.251
it was like I was saying,
"I am getting too old."

17:23.335 --> 17:26.171
And you don't know
what that feels like --

17:26.171 --> 17:29.382
all these new people
and this new tech.

17:29.466 --> 17:30.967
It just made me feel like

17:31.051 --> 17:32.761
I was being pushed out to sea.

17:34.888 --> 17:37.182
Okay, well, if you're
being pushed out,

17:37.182 --> 17:41.019
then I'm being pushed out, too,
because it's hard for me.

17:41.019 --> 17:43.605
It's hard for all of us,
even the kids,

17:43.605 --> 17:45.690
and they come out of the womb
selling NFTs.

17:45.774 --> 17:49.027
See? I don't even know
what that is.

17:49.027 --> 17:51.321
So I guess I'm just an oldface.

17:51.321 --> 17:53.990
- Oldhead.
- And that, too.

17:54.074 --> 17:56.076
I don't know what NFT means,
either.

17:56.076 --> 17:57.911
Hm.

18:00.080 --> 18:05.085
What if we figured out
this stuff together?

18:07.087 --> 18:09.339
I'd like that.

18:10.715 --> 18:12.759
Okay.

18:14.719 --> 18:16.805
Are we having a moment
right now?

18:17.764 --> 18:20.308
Are those jelly beans
on your belt?

18:23.103 --> 18:25.480
I wanted to teach Barbara
something so bad

18:25.480 --> 18:28.733
that I never considered
what she might be going through.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.861
But we did have a little
bonding moment back there.

18:31.945 --> 18:34.030
I ruined it, but it happened.

18:34.114 --> 18:35.615
You got that, right?

18:37.367 --> 18:38.827
Hey.

18:38.827 --> 18:41.287
I brought you some lasagna
as a peace offering.

18:41.371 --> 18:42.789
You know, I don't just
eat Italian,

18:42.789 --> 18:44.624
or am I a stereotype to you?

18:44.708 --> 18:46.710
Oh, my God, no. Of course not.
I'll -- I'll throw it out.

18:46.710 --> 18:49.087
Hey, hey. What am I, an idiot?
Give it to me.

18:51.965 --> 18:54.259
- Oh!
- Um.

18:54.259 --> 18:56.636
Melissa, I...

18:56.720 --> 19:00.473
I made some dumb assumptions
about you, about South Philly.

19:00.557 --> 19:03.727
I was condescending.
Basically, I was a jerk.

19:03.727 --> 19:06.438
I wish my ex-husband
could ever admit that much.

19:06.438 --> 19:08.481
Well, I'm really sorry.

19:08.565 --> 19:10.817
Listen, you're trying to
sanitize this place

19:10.817 --> 19:12.402
and its history --
it doesn't need it.

19:12.402 --> 19:15.071
This is who we are,
the good, the bad, and the ugly.

19:15.155 --> 19:17.615
Tire Iron, of course,
representing the ugly.

19:17.699 --> 19:20.201
Well, I wouldn't say that...
to his face.

19:20.285 --> 19:22.662
Hey, I know
you mean well, hon.

19:22.746 --> 19:24.622
You want the best for your kids.

19:24.706 --> 19:27.334
Just next time, have a more
open mind, that's all.

19:27.334 --> 19:29.711
I will. And -- And thank you.

19:29.711 --> 19:32.005
My students got a lot
out of what Vinny had to say.

19:32.005 --> 19:33.715
- Oh, good.
- They collectively bargained,

19:33.715 --> 19:35.008
and they all have pensions now.

19:36.593 --> 19:38.470
Solid.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.557
- But...
- There you go!

19:42.557 --> 19:44.184
- Yes!
- Yes!

19:44.184 --> 19:47.312
It can be daunting when a new
technology is introduced

19:47.312 --> 19:49.481
and it's changing the way
you do things,

19:49.481 --> 19:51.483
but this is the future.

19:51.483 --> 19:53.735
- I got in.
- I've mastered it.

19:53.735 --> 19:55.111
Girrrrllls...

19:55.195 --> 19:56.738
and Young Idris.

19:56.738 --> 19:58.740
Turns out the software
we've been using

19:58.740 --> 20:01.117
was invented by
the Pennsylvania Penal System

20:01.201 --> 20:02.494
to collect data for prisons.

20:02.494 --> 20:04.079
Prisons?

20:04.079 --> 20:05.538
Something about
the correlation

20:05.622 --> 20:07.290
between lower reading levels

20:07.374 --> 20:08.708
and the amount of prison beds
they're supposed to build?

20:08.792 --> 20:09.959
Oh, my God.

20:10.043 --> 20:11.336
Apparently, it's illegal.

20:11.336 --> 20:15.173
I am just as disgusted
as you all are.

20:15.173 --> 20:16.883
Disgraceful.

20:16.883 --> 20:19.135
You're gonna sell those,
aren't you?

20:19.219 --> 20:21.763
And what would you rather I do,
Melissa?

20:23.640 --> 20:26.351
That's a shame.
I really liked that feature

20:26.351 --> 20:30.605
where I could teach a whole
class on just one letter.

20:30.689 --> 20:32.232
You know what?

20:32.232 --> 20:35.652
I think I might know something
we can use instead.

20:35.652 --> 20:36.903
- It's pretty simple. And then...
- Very.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.154
...the fun thing
about this is...

20:38.238 --> 20:41.783
"At 54,
I'm still in progress,

20:41.783 --> 20:44.786
and I hope I always will be."

20:45.495 --> 20:46.788
- Did he just --
- Oh, my God.

20:46.788 --> 20:48.331
- You -- You just read!
- You just read!

20:48.415 --> 20:49.582
He just read!

20:49.666 --> 20:51.292
- You're a baby genius!
- Yes!

20:51.376 --> 20:54.295
- Wow.
- Ooh, yes!

20:54.379 --> 20:55.755
Oh, my goodness!

20:57.007 --> 20:58.842
Yes, yes!

21:00.135 --> 21:02.345
"Failure is a feeling

21:02.429 --> 21:06.850
long before it becomes
an actual result."

21:06.850 --> 21:08.560
Mm. I know that's right.

21:08.560 --> 21:09.936
Can I have a break?

21:10.020 --> 21:11.604
No, keep reading.
It's just getting good.

21:12.939 --> 21:15.400
Mnh-mnh-mnh.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.944
Absolutely not. Let's go.

21:18.028 --> 21:19.487
- Come on, Barbara!
- Come on.

21:21.281 --> 21:23.700
You owe me
an Audible membership!
