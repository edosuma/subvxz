three minutes and dies within seven.

07:21.344 --> 07:23.744
So if this were an accident,
as the defense claims,

07:23.746 --> 07:27.263
and Mr. Cox ran right down to that dock

07:27.344 --> 07:28.810
as soon as he heard the splash,

07:28.812 --> 07:31.113
he would have had at least seven minutes

07:31.115 --> 07:33.448
- to rescue his wife?
- WOMAN: Yes.

07:33.450 --> 07:36.151
Thank you. Pass the witness.

07:36.153 --> 07:39.354
According to the toxicology
report, on the night she died,

07:39.356 --> 07:41.023
Mrs. Cox had a blood alcohol level

07:41.025 --> 07:43.392
of .26% and the prescription drug Xanax

07:43.394 --> 07:44.826
and Valium in her system,

07:44.828 --> 07:46.395
- correct?
- I'm aware.

07:46.397 --> 07:48.697
Could she have passed out from all that?

07:48.699 --> 07:50.298
I suppose, but we don't know
that's how it happened.

07:50.300 --> 07:52.234
Well, let me ask you this...

07:52.236 --> 07:54.903
one of the reliable signs
of drowning at autopsy

07:54.905 --> 07:57.105
is the presence of a fine, white froth

07:57.107 --> 07:58.770
around the nose and the mouth, correct?

07:58.795 --> 07:59.914
Yes.

07:59.916 --> 08:01.063
What does that indicate?

08:01.088 --> 08:02.889
That the victim was struggling for air.

08:02.956 --> 08:04.155
And to be struggling for air,

08:04.157 --> 08:05.723
the victim would
have to be conscious, right?

08:05.725 --> 08:06.531
Yes.

08:06.556 --> 08:07.859
Referring you
to state's exhibit 14 here...

08:07.861 --> 08:11.496
did you find any fine, white froth

08:11.498 --> 08:14.142
around the nose and mouth at autopsy?

08:16.162 --> 08:16.820
No.

08:17.829 --> 08:19.170
So if the victim
wasn't struggling for air,

08:19.172 --> 08:20.671
surely it's reasonable to conclude

08:20.673 --> 08:22.240
that she was unconscious.

08:23.146 --> 08:24.599
I can't rule it out.

08:24.600 --> 08:26.645
Exactly. And if she was unconscious

08:26.647 --> 08:27.945
when she hit that water,

08:27.947 --> 08:29.547
how long would it take for her to die?

08:34.006 --> 08:35.572
30 to 45 seconds.

08:35.573 --> 08:37.712
30 to 45 seconds.

08:39.445 --> 08:41.682
That's not much time
to make a rescue, is it?

08:42.815 --> 08:44.748
<i>My toxicologist was great.</i>

08:44.750 --> 08:46.950
He had the whole jury convinced
that she must have passed out

08:46.952 --> 08:48.385
before she hit the water.

08:48.387 --> 08:51.321
Put his report in, rested my case.

08:51.323 --> 08:52.789
You didn't put your guy on the stand?

08:52.791 --> 08:55.225
Didn't need to. The D.A.
didn't prove his case.

08:55.227 --> 08:57.461
Guys, come on, I know what I'm doing.

08:57.463 --> 08:58.662
I'm gonna win this case.

08:58.664 --> 09:00.130
And then you're gonna make me partner.

09:39.559 --> 09:41.693
tailor-made. That's not off the rack.

09:42.270 --> 09:43.895
- How you doing, Shawn?
- Oh, man.

09:45.399 --> 09:46.564
Look at you, Jackie,

09:46.566 --> 09:48.210
you just bossin'.

09:48.493 --> 09:49.434
Been a long time.

09:50.606 --> 09:51.786
Yeah, it has.

09:52.853 --> 09:54.271
Come here. (grunts)

09:54.273 --> 09:55.173
(laughs)

09:55.175 --> 09:58.310
All right. 25 years, man. Unbelievable.

10:00.013 --> 10:03.148
So, uh, what are you
guys doing in Houston?

10:03.679 --> 10:05.537
We live here. You live here?

10:05.539 --> 10:07.264
And we need your help with something.

10:07.266 --> 10:08.477
It's with Boots.

10:08.479 --> 10:09.716
Got arrested this morning.

10:10.564 --> 10:11.579
What for?

10:11.932 --> 10:14.039
Assault with a deadly weapon.

10:14.401 --> 10:15.967
And they got him locked up

10:15.969 --> 10:17.569
over at county. He needs a lawyer,

10:17.571 --> 10:18.724
we got to get him out ASAP.

10:18.726 --> 10:21.177
Guys... I'd really love to help you out,

10:21.179 --> 10:22.941
but I'm in the middle of a huge trial.

10:22.943 --> 10:24.225
There's no way I can leave right now.

10:26.377 --> 10:28.547
Listen, you walked out on us
once and we dealt with that,

10:28.549 --> 10:32.017
but this isn't about you
right now. This is about us.

10:32.019 --> 10:33.518
You, me, Shawn and Boots.

10:33.520 --> 10:35.934
Yeah, well, I know a lot
of good lawyers, all right?

10:36.268 --> 10:37.589
I'm gonna refer you to
someone who specializes...

10:37.591 --> 10:39.991
The guy Boots attacked was Darryl.

10:47.095 --> 10:48.300
Darryl from Quitman?

10:51.689 --> 10:53.203
Now you get what we're saying.

10:53.205 --> 10:55.841
Jackie, Boots was our brother.

10:56.728 --> 10:58.811
He doesn't need just any lawyer.

10:59.211 --> 11:00.378
He needs you.

11:06.487 --> 11:09.093
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

11:11.444 --> 11:13.544
You ever seen this guy before?

11:13.546 --> 11:15.746
(raspy gasping, labored breathing)

11:15.748 --> 11:17.548
Was anybody else with him?

11:17.550 --> 11:19.650
(loud coughing)

11:19.652 --> 11:21.352
All right.

11:21.354 --> 11:22.244
Just take it easy, Darryl.

11:22.246 --> 11:23.796
We're gonna find who did this.

11:24.624 --> 11:27.091
- Don't worry.
- (breathing loudly)

11:27.093 --> 11:30.394
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

11:35.239 --> 11:37.735
JACKSON: <i>Boots, hurry up.</i>

11:37.737 --> 11:39.136
(door opens)

11:39.138 --> 11:41.105
Thank you.

11:43.362 --> 11:45.600
(door closes)

11:49.934 --> 11:51.381
Hey, come here.

11:56.789 --> 11:59.176
You doing okay?

12:02.600 --> 12:04.126
I... I've been better.

12:04.549 --> 12:06.516
You don't have to worry. I'm here now.

12:06.518 --> 12:07.701
I'm gonna take care of you, okay?

12:08.487 --> 12:10.822
(sighs)

12:10.824 --> 12:12.104
Where's Gil and Shawn?

12:12.706 --> 12:13.733
Outside.

12:14.333 --> 12:15.565
We have to talk alone,

12:15.567 --> 12:17.334
or it waives attorney-client privilege.

12:17.672 --> 12:20.103
Did you say anything to the detectives?

12:20.758 --> 12:22.439
- No.
- Good.

12:22.441 --> 12:25.475
You have me now, so they're not
gonna bother you anymore.

12:26.165 --> 12:27.363
I'm gonna speak to the D.A.,

12:27.365 --> 12:28.750
we're gonna get that arrest report.

12:28.752 --> 12:30.380
We're gonna figure out a
way to fix this mistake.

12:30.819 --> 12:32.290
This wasn't a mistake.

12:33.629 --> 12:35.919
You're sitting there acting like
you don't know who this was.

12:36.979 --> 12:38.106
It was Darryl.

12:38.635 --> 12:41.291
I saw him in the street, and
I recognized him, and I just...

12:42.258 --> 12:43.260
Yeah.

12:45.281 --> 12:46.563
I just snapped.

12:48.896 --> 12:50.561
And I'm not sorry about it, either.

12:51.448 --> 12:53.028
As far as I'm concerned,
he had it coming.

12:55.705 --> 12:57.307
They all do.

13:00.484 --> 13:02.785
JACKSON: <i>The woman we hit didn't die,</i>

13:02.787 --> 13:05.988
<i>but there was hell to pay.</i>

13:06.524 --> 13:08.390
<i>We each got nine months</i>

13:09.067 --> 13:11.325
<i>at one of the worst places on Earth...</i>

13:12.133 --> 13:14.362
<i>Quitman.</i>

13:36.172 --> 13:38.339
<i>We were like lambs to the slaughter.</i>

13:39.909 --> 13:42.209
MAN: Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

13:42.211 --> 13:43.932
We ain't got all day!

13:44.280 --> 13:46.113
Clothing and shoes and belt in the tray.

13:46.115 --> 13:48.089
Personal effects in the bag.

13:48.418 --> 13:49.750
Let's hurry it up, ladies.

13:55.642 --> 13:56.771
Sir?

13:57.885 --> 13:59.178
That's Gil's money.

14:02.471 --> 14:03.737
(gasps)

14:09.689 --> 14:11.127
Did I ask you to talk?

14:12.021 --> 14:14.031
Ain't nothing here that's yours anymore.

14:19.008 --> 14:20.968
Don't y'all worry about the warden.

14:21.634 --> 14:24.111
He knows how we run things around here.

14:24.671 --> 14:26.497
Let's move it, chicken little!

14:28.850 --> 14:30.277
DARRYL: Hey.

14:30.643 --> 14:32.143
Better stop crying.

14:32.145 --> 14:34.112
Do that inside, and you're dead meat.

14:40.620 --> 14:41.819
(pool balls clink)

14:42.442 --> 14:43.687
SHAWN: So you really can't tell us

14:43.690 --> 14:45.823
- what he said?
- No.

14:47.976 --> 14:49.093
You're getting him out, though, right?

14:49.095 --> 14:50.431
I don't know.

14:51.111 --> 14:52.477
The arraignment's tomorrow.

14:53.997 --> 14:56.066
Geez, what-what... what's the hurry?

14:56.069 --> 14:57.802
I told you one drink, okay?

14:57.804 --> 15:01.263
SHAWN: What's...? Jackie,
come on, another drink

15:01.265 --> 15:02.927
on us. We got it. We got it.

15:03.581 --> 15:04.785
Jackson?

15:05.489 --> 15:06.632
Jessie.

15:14.069 --> 15:15.890
What...? What are you doing here?

15:17.093 --> 15:18.826
Gil invited me.

15:19.381 --> 15:20.995
I'll go get you a chair.

15:23.588 --> 15:24.899
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:31.086 --> 15:32.373
GIL: Okay, here we go.

15:32.375 --> 15:33.808
(laughs)

15:34.619 --> 15:36.810
Isn't this amazing? We got
the whole gang back together?

15:36.812 --> 15:38.513
- SHAWN: What up, sis?

16:15.485 --> 16:17.945
Hey, I'm gonna head out.

16:18.605 --> 16:20.505
SHAWN: Sis! No!

16:20.507 --> 16:22.107
It was good to see you, Jackson.

16:22.109 --> 16:23.808
You, too.

16:23.810 --> 16:25.610
See you two later.

16:25.613 --> 16:26.746
You're just gonna... you're just gonna

16:26.748 --> 16:28.080
- leave your boys like that?
- I'm out.

16:28.082 --> 16:29.482
And she's out.

16:29.484 --> 16:31.150
She's out.

16:31.152 --> 16:34.286
All right, well,
now we can talk about it.

16:34.288 --> 16:35.621
About what?

16:35.623 --> 16:36.849
About what?

16:37.959 --> 16:39.525
Time for payback.

16:39.527 --> 16:40.726
We're not having this conversation, Gil.

16:40.728 --> 16:41.861
The hell we aren't.

16:41.863 --> 16:43.829
You know, I say we start with the warden

16:43.831 --> 16:45.464
and those sons of bitches Red and Bobby.

16:45.466 --> 16:46.766
Bobby's still at Quitman.

16:46.768 --> 16:48.567
Terry, Dennis and Eddie
are gonna be harder,

16:48.569 --> 16:50.269
but that's where you come in.

16:50.271 --> 16:52.638
You find them, you get me close to them,

16:53.379 --> 16:54.073
and they'll be the next to go.

16:54.075 --> 16:56.175
Are you insane? I'm not gonna do that.

16:56.177 --> 16:58.166
We need you, Jackie. We need a plan.

16:58.246 --> 17:00.257
I'm a lawyer for God sake.

17:00.259 --> 17:01.664
Do you even understand
what you're asking?

17:01.666 --> 17:02.748
We didn't start this, man. They did.

17:02.750 --> 17:04.138
You're saying you don't want revenge?

17:04.164 --> 17:05.250
You're talking about

17:05.252 --> 17:07.520
- committing a crime.
- No, we're talking about justice!

17:07.521 --> 17:08.753
SHAWN: G.

17:08.756 --> 17:10.356
G!

17:10.358 --> 17:13.693
You know, for everything
that they did to us.

17:16.137 --> 17:17.837
The past is the past, Gil.

17:17.839 --> 17:19.271
I'm about to get married.

17:19.272 --> 17:21.240
Do you think I'm gonna throw
that away just so you can...?

17:21.242 --> 17:22.624
- Did you forget what happened?
- Yes, I did!

17:26.373 --> 17:28.021
So should you.

17:30.806 --> 17:32.218
You're lying.

17:35.669 --> 17:37.144
You know you remember.

17:39.585 --> 17:41.349
That's why you still
have the nightmares.

17:42.653 --> 17:45.664
That's why your heart aches
every time you see a little kid.

17:46.563 --> 17:50.035
This thing will haunt you, Jackie.

17:51.284 --> 17:54.907
Whatever they did to us
in that prison...

17:57.706 --> 17:59.186
...we're still there.

18:00.453 --> 18:03.110
And we are never getting out
until we do something about it.

18:06.358 --> 18:08.629
I said I'd help you out
with Boots, and I will,

18:08.631 --> 18:11.601
but that is it, you understand?

18:11.724 --> 18:13.123
No, Jackie, that's not it.

18:17.799 --> 18:19.031
Stay away from me.

18:19.637 --> 18:20.532
Both of you.

18:21.224 --> 18:23.071
Come on, Jackie, just...

18:23.602 --> 18:24.667
Man!

18:26.887 --> 18:28.012
We lost him.

18:28.488 --> 18:29.954
Shut up. We didn't lose him.

18:29.956 --> 18:31.979
How you know? Because he remembered.

18:35.684 --> 18:37.896
Hey, hey, can we get some more drinks?

18:37.898 --> 18:39.364
Another round.

18:39.366 --> 18:41.533
What's your problem?

18:41.535 --> 18:43.268
Let it go, G.

18:46.306 --> 18:48.706
(groaning) What? Huh?

18:48.708 --> 18:49.941
(indistinct shouting)

18:49.943 --> 18:51.910
(grunting)

18:53.547 --> 18:54.612
Get off him! Gil!

19:00.966 --> 19:02.127
I'm sorry.

19:04.170 --> 19:06.151
Come on, don't be mad.

19:06.706 --> 19:08.640
(sighs)

19:08.642 --> 19:10.455
Okay, you want to know
why I'm mad at you?

19:10.797 --> 19:12.102
Because you invited me for drinks,

19:12.127 --> 19:14.660
and you didn't tell me
Jackson was gonna be there.

19:14.923 --> 19:16.256
I thought you'd like it.

19:16.258 --> 19:19.049
You haven't seen him in 25 years.

19:24.072 --> 19:25.698
Am I wrong? Have you two been in touch?

19:26.858 --> 19:30.737
No. I just... I just think it's strange

19:30.739 --> 19:33.040
that, all of a sudden, he's
just back in our lives.

19:33.042 --> 19:35.609
Well, Jessie,
it was one night of drinks.

19:35.611 --> 19:37.277
And it was weird.

19:37.957 --> 19:39.146
Is something going on?

19:39.148 --> 19:41.214
No.

19:42.261 --> 19:44.116
He missed us, he reached out,
we had a couple drinks.

19:44.119 --> 19:46.368
I don't understand why you're upset.

19:46.370 --> 19:48.664
I'm upset because you
obviously didn't tell him

19:48.666 --> 19:49.859
that we were together.

19:50.760 --> 19:52.727
Listen, Jackson is my brother.

19:52.729 --> 19:54.563
I'm not gonna keep it from him.

19:54.965 --> 19:56.798
Okay, so you're gonna tell him?

19:56.800 --> 19:57.562
Yeah.

19:58.602 --> 19:59.938
When the time is right.

20:02.906 --> 20:04.872
Okay.

20:06.731 --> 20:07.909
Let me see your hand.

20:12.483 --> 20:14.482
You're really an idiot sometimes.

20:16.762 --> 20:17.657
What?

20:19.148 --> 20:20.388
No, you're right.

20:51.296 --> 20:52.583
TERRY: Where you think you're going?

20:53.331 --> 20:54.967
I have to pee.

20:55.567 --> 20:57.099
TERRY: The bathroom belongs to me.

20:57.101 --> 21:00.236
You want to go, you got to pay.

21:03.306 --> 21:04.721
Leave him alone.

21:08.433 --> 21:10.580
What you gonna do about it?

21:10.582 --> 21:11.675
Hmm?

21:14.284 --> 21:16.651
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

21:17.701 --> 21:19.726
What the hell's going on, Terry?

21:20.636 --> 21:22.252
Caught him trying to steal my stuff.

21:22.879 --> 21:24.124
No, I wasn't!

21:24.614 --> 21:25.272
He's lying.

21:25.274 --> 21:26.152
Back in your bunks.

21:26.500 --> 21:27.555
All of you now!

21:27.987 --> 21:29.629
But he has to go to the bathroom.

21:30.986 --> 21:32.223
You're gonna be the problem, huh?

21:32.225 --> 21:34.558
I didn't do anything! Ugh!

21:34.560 --> 21:36.060
What are you doing?

21:36.567 --> 21:37.394
Get off me.

21:38.052 --> 21:39.063
(Jackson yells)

21:39.065 --> 21:40.331
(whimpers)

21:40.333 --> 21:41.499
(belt continues striking)

21:41.501 --> 21:43.667
(Jackson continues yelling)

21:47.907 --> 21:50.875
(siren wailing in distance)

22:01.136 --> 22:02.585
All right, how did this happen?

22:03.585 --> 22:05.156

34:36.011 --> 34:37.310
What are you doing, Gil?

34:37.312 --> 34:38.699
Darryl's here.

34:39.402 --> 34:41.902
Same hospital I just watched
my friend die.

34:43.277 --> 34:44.117
What are you gonna do?

34:44.119 --> 34:45.851
You're gonna walk in there
and shoot him in his bed?

34:45.853 --> 34:48.888
- Eye for an eye, brother.
- Gil, stop. Stop.

34:49.868 --> 34:51.891
I know you're upset about Boots.

34:52.473 --> 34:54.177
- So am I.
- Shut up. Shut up.

34:54.650 --> 34:55.802
You don't get to say that.

34:55.804 --> 34:57.483
You left us. I'm right here.

34:57.887 --> 34:59.564
I'm right here now, Gil.

35:01.090 --> 35:02.691
This is just so much bigger
than you know.

35:02.918 --> 35:04.151
What the hell are you talking about?

35:04.176 --> 35:05.542
I spoke to Gangs Squad today.

35:05.567 --> 35:08.267
They said Darryl works
for Terry and Eddie

35:08.364 --> 35:10.498
running drugs, guns,
God knows whatever else.

35:10.500 --> 35:11.438
They're in deep with the cartels.

35:11.471 --> 35:12.185
So?

35:12.210 --> 35:14.297
So these guys are connected, Gil.

35:14.838 --> 35:16.504
I've been looking into this.

35:16.506 --> 35:18.072
You remember the night of the riot?

35:20.122 --> 35:22.477
The warden, his guards,

35:22.954 --> 35:24.712
they all walked out on us. They left us.

35:24.714 --> 35:26.414
They said they lost control of E House.

35:26.416 --> 35:28.983
They said they were scared for
their safety. That was a setup.

35:28.985 --> 35:30.618
- That was all planned.
- Who the hell cares?

35:30.620 --> 35:34.722
You do! A year later, they sold
Quitman to a private company.

35:34.724 --> 35:36.509
Guess who ended up vice president.

35:37.614 --> 35:38.793
Warden Carroll.

35:39.336 --> 35:41.662
Ten years later, guess who's the
head of the state parole board.

35:41.664 --> 35:42.997
Warden Carroll.

35:42.999 --> 35:44.867
They made him lieutenant governor.

35:44.981 --> 35:47.448
He is running for congress,
for God's sake.

35:47.450 --> 35:48.981
You can't just walk up on the street
and shoot him.

35:49.006 --> 35:49.851
Watch me.

35:49.853 --> 35:53.555
The way to get these guys is to
expose them for what they did.

35:53.557 --> 35:56.691
We get 'em all arrested and they
spend the rest of their lives

35:56.693 --> 35:59.139
- in prison.
- You don't get it, do you?

35:59.629 --> 36:02.230
(scoffs)

36:02.232 --> 36:04.566
I'd rather die

36:04.568 --> 36:07.715
than have anyone know
what happened to us.

36:08.738 --> 36:11.321
You don't mean that, Gil.

36:14.244 --> 36:16.644
- I swear to God, Jackie.
- Gil...

36:16.646 --> 36:17.946
Why not?

36:17.948 --> 36:19.113
Gil, look at me. Look at me.

36:19.115 --> 36:21.903
I'm your brother. I'm your brother.

36:22.097 --> 36:24.031
And I've got you. I've got you.

36:24.033 --> 36:25.499
Put it down.

36:25.501 --> 36:29.436
Hey. I'm here. I got you.

36:40.133 --> 36:41.490
Nobody's perfect.

36:43.361 --> 36:45.894
And when we put the past
under a microscope,

36:45.896 --> 36:48.240
it's-it's easy
to second-guess ourselves.

36:49.706 --> 36:53.157
Are there things that we did
that we regret?

36:54.843 --> 36:58.237
<i>Are there things that we didn't
do that we-we wish we had?</i>

36:59.886 --> 37:02.486
<i>I think the answer's yes for all of us.</i>

37:04.478 --> 37:06.225
Because we're human beings.

37:06.226 --> 37:08.971
We... we feel.

37:10.454 --> 37:11.630
<i>We love.</i>

37:12.950 --> 37:15.633
<i>We-we hurt. We cry.</i>

37:16.151 --> 37:17.432
<i>But no one really knows</i>

37:17.434 --> 37:19.860
what is truly in our hearts.

37:21.741 --> 37:23.641
And that's the problem
the State has here.

37:24.053 --> 37:26.657
They have the burden to prove,
beyond a reasonable doubt,

37:27.144 --> 37:29.429
that my client knowingly

37:29.431 --> 37:32.318
and intentionally threw his wife
off that dock

37:32.320 --> 37:33.951
and watched her drown.

37:34.795 --> 37:36.191
But they haven't done that.

37:36.193 --> 37:37.888
They haven't even come close.

37:37.890 --> 37:39.815
Yes, there was an argument that night.

37:41.276 --> 37:42.017
But you know what?

37:42.019 --> 37:43.324
People fight all the time.

37:44.111 --> 37:46.845
<i>They get angry, and we get upset.</i>

37:46.847 --> 37:48.454
<i>But we don't commit murder.</i>

37:48.815 --> 37:50.204
<i>Because we're resilient.</i>

37:51.017 --> 37:54.445
<i>We're strong, and we just walk away.</i>

37:55.281 --> 37:57.428
<i>That is exactly what Frank Cox did.</i>

37:58.077 --> 38:02.459
This was nothing more than a terrible,

38:02.462 --> 38:04.516
tragic accident.

38:05.672 --> 38:08.966
So I ask you to return
the only just verdict,

38:08.969 --> 38:10.573
which is not guilty.

38:12.517 --> 38:15.955
It's time to let this man
get on with his life.

38:17.349 --> 38:18.943
AARON: <i>All right, everybody, listen up.</i>

38:19.781 --> 38:21.146
First, to a job well done

38:21.148 --> 38:24.215
and a not guilty
verdict in <i> State v. Cox.</i>

38:24.217 --> 38:26.551
(applause) And second,

38:27.141 --> 38:28.475
to our newest partner.

38:30.547 --> 38:34.366
Who will now be working not for
but with his future wife.

38:34.942 --> 38:37.414
- Congratulations,Jackson.
- Hear, hear!

38:37.416 --> 38:39.397
I'm so proud of you.

38:43.416 --> 38:45.182
Been looking forward to this day.

38:45.184 --> 38:46.851
So impressive. It was a great speech.

38:46.853 --> 38:49.253
- (phone rings)
- Succinct and simple. I liked it.

38:49.255 --> 38:51.222
- Nice.
- Less is more.

38:51.224 --> 38:53.190
Excuse me.

38:54.828 --> 38:55.797
Hello?

38:55.876 --> 38:58.396
MAN: You really don't want
to kick this rock.

39:01.239 --> 39:02.338
Who is this?

39:02.340 --> 39:03.906
You better be careful, Counselor.

39:03.908 --> 39:05.875
I don't like people asking questions.

39:06.532 --> 39:08.345
I know what you did.

39:10.046 --> 39:11.013
JESSIE: <i>Who was on the phone?</i>

39:11.015 --> 39:12.248
JACKSON: <i>I have no idea.</i>

39:12.917 --> 39:14.183
It doesn't make any sense.

39:14.185 --> 39:16.053
Nobody knows what happened.

39:16.454 --> 39:18.556
RED: What are you gonna do, Jackie?!

39:19.157 --> 39:20.857
Well, I sure didn't tell anyone.

39:22.313 --> 39:24.071
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

39:24.073 --> 39:25.995
(thunder crashes)

39:29.468 --> 39:30.250
<i>Jessie, I'm gonna</i>

39:30.275 --> 39:32.336
ask you something,
and you have to answer me

39:32.338 --> 39:33.579
honestly.

39:34.140 --> 39:35.258
Did you tell Gil?

39:35.474 --> 39:36.774
No. I mean it.

39:36.776 --> 39:37.708
I just... Jackson,

39:37.710 --> 39:39.977
I didn't tell him. I...

39:39.979 --> 39:41.554
I didn't tell anybody.

39:41.814 --> 39:44.092
Not one person in all these years.

39:44.483 --> 39:45.573
I don't want...

39:46.429 --> 39:47.813
I don't want to go jail.

39:47.815 --> 39:49.353
No one's going to jail, Jessie.

39:49.355 --> 39:51.455
No one is going to jail.

39:54.961 --> 39:57.228
- (grunting)
- JESSIE (muffled): Jackson!

39:57.230 --> 39:58.729
Stop!

40:06.448 --> 40:09.291
I'm sorry that I got you into this.

40:09.316 --> 40:11.072
I'm sorry that I left.

40:13.288 --> 40:14.791
(sighs)

40:16.526 --> 40:18.927
- You can't do this to me.
- Jessie...

40:18.929 --> 40:20.772
- I'm just... I'm just tr...
- I mean it.

40:23.701 --> 40:25.567
You got to stay out of my life.

40:33.024 --> 40:36.344
JACKSON: <i>There are lies we tell
to make ourselves feel better.</i>

40:40.101 --> 40:41.987
<i>About who we are.</i>

40:43.916 --> 40:46.716
<i>About what we're capable of.</i>

40:47.291 --> 40:49.557
PRIEST: ...this body we commit
to the ground,

40:49.559 --> 40:52.994
earth to earth, ashes to ashes,

40:52.996 --> 40:55.130
dust to dust.

40:55.132 --> 40:58.466
Blessed are the dead
who die in the Lord. Amen.

41:06.147 --> 41:08.596
<i>We all wanted to move on with our lives.</i>

41:09.580 --> 41:10.951
<i>To forget what happened to us.</i>

41:11.205 --> 41:12.338
Bye, baby.

41:13.465 --> 41:15.441
<i>But the past is never the past.</i>
Love you.

41:17.148 --> 41:18.778
<i>If it were,</i>

41:18.780 --> 41:20.593
<i>there would be no tragedy.</i>

41:44.088 --> 41:45.071
Detective.

41:47.327 --> 41:48.808
What's going on?

41:49.839 --> 41:52.043
Darryl Williams died this morning.

41:55.319 --> 41:56.325
I'm sorry to hear that.

41:57.118 --> 41:59.394
He wasn't in the hospital.
He was at home.

42:01.549 --> 42:02.926
We found him on his kitchen floor

42:03.053 --> 42:04.677
with three bullet holes in his chest.

42:05.853 --> 42:08.469
Just wondering if you gentlemen
might know anything about that.
