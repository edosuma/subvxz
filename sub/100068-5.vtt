ANNOUNCER :
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome

00:24.154 --> 00:26.200
-Just a reminder that...
-Damn it. Where is Frank?

00:26.243 --> 00:27.549
I'm not missing
this lion feeding.

00:27.592 --> 00:29.333
CHARLIE:
Oh, lions are cool, man.

00:29.377 --> 00:30.769
For sure. But, you know,
the best exhibit's

00:30.813 --> 00:32.336
-the meerkats. You know?
-Meerkats!

00:32.380 --> 00:34.643
-Hey, man, you know,
they have those bubbles,

00:34.686 --> 00:36.862
you know, where you can pop
your head up out of the ground

00:36.906 --> 00:38.125
-and look around.
-Yeah, you're looking around.

00:38.168 --> 00:39.343
It's like you area meerkat.

00:39.387 --> 00:40.997
No, I'm not waiting for Frank.
I'm-I'm just gonna go in.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.477
-No.
-'Cause I-I don't want
to wait here for the guy.

00:42.520 --> 00:44.479
I know.
But I think we should...

00:44.522 --> 00:46.350
I really feel like
we need to stick together.

00:46.394 --> 00:48.135
-CHARLIE: Huh?
-Dee, will you calm down?
She got lost at the zoo

00:48.178 --> 00:49.919
-when we were seven. It's fine.-I-I got trampled

00:49.962 --> 00:52.356
-by wild animals at the zoo
when I was seven.
-Sheep.

00:52.400 --> 00:53.531
-At the petting zoo.
-Goats!

00:53.575 --> 00:55.272
-It was.
-You don't have to worry
about that. Okay, guys?

00:55.316 --> 00:57.535
Because modern technology
has figured this out for us.

00:57.579 --> 00:59.711
We're all connected now.

00:59.755 --> 01:01.583
That is why I started
this group text chain.

01:01.626 --> 01:04.150
You know? So we can stay
in constant communication.

01:04.194 --> 01:05.543
I'm just gonna hit up Frank
real quick,

01:05.587 --> 01:07.154
-and we'll find out what's up.

01:07.197 --> 01:09.547
Guys, this way,
nobody is gonna get lost,

01:09.591 --> 01:11.984
because the texting
keeps us all on the same page.

01:12.028 --> 01:13.899
-Okay.
-Oh. Well, see, there you go.

01:13.943 --> 01:15.466
-Frank's five minutes away.
-Great.
-No, no, no.

01:15.510 --> 01:17.120
No, everybody knows
that "five min away"

01:17.164 --> 01:19.122
actually means
20 minutes away, okay?

01:19.166 --> 01:20.384
I'm not missing
this live feeding, okay?

01:20.428 --> 01:22.256
Dude, why the big deal
about watching a-a lion

01:22.299 --> 01:23.300
eat a pile of dead meat?

01:23.344 --> 01:25.128
Oh, no, no, no. Wrong. Alive.

01:25.172 --> 01:27.261
Okay? Quite alive,
I assure you.

01:27.304 --> 01:29.132
-That's a thing? Zoos do that?
-That's a thing.

01:29.176 --> 01:31.395
What's this?

01:31.439 --> 01:32.527
-Dennis has a boner? He does?
-Yes.

01:32.570 --> 01:34.572
-CHARLIE: No, he doesn't.
-Well, goddamn it, he did.

01:34.616 --> 01:36.574
I did. It's gone now.

01:36.618 --> 01:38.402
Uh, do we have to do
this whole texting thing?

01:38.446 --> 01:40.752
-I mean, Dee's already annoying.-She's always been annoying,Charlie.

01:40.796 --> 01:42.406
That's why we ditched her
when she was seven.

01:42.450 --> 01:44.626
-You... ditched me?
-Oh, shut up, Dee. Shut up!

01:44.669 --> 01:46.323
God, don't make this
all about you.

01:46.367 --> 01:48.151
-I'm-I'm going in.
I don't-I don't want to wait.
-Well, then I'm gonna

01:48.195 --> 01:50.066
-go with you, 'cause I don't
want to get ditched again.
-Fine. Whatever.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.415
-Yeah, we'll catch up with you.-DEE: Look, look, look.

01:51.459 --> 01:53.025
And just text us
when he gets here.

01:53.069 --> 01:54.201
Who? Frank?

01:54.244 --> 01:56.855
Yes, Frank. Who else
would we be talking about?

01:56.899 --> 01:59.771
-Oh, well, I just want to makesure we're all on the same page.-DEE: Oh, my God.

01:59.815 --> 02:01.599
Text us when Frank gets here!

02:01.643 --> 02:03.297
Huh?!

02:03.340 --> 02:05.168
-Frank. Text...-Frank! What? Text us! Text us!

02:05.212 --> 02:07.214
BOTH:
Text us when Frank gets here!

02:07.257 --> 02:08.866
I can't... I can't...
You know what?

02:08.911 --> 02:10.304
-I can't... Let me just...
I'm-a...
-Text 'em now.

02:10.347 --> 02:12.436
I'm gonna text y...
Check your phone!

02:12.480 --> 02:14.438
-I'm gonna text you!

02:40.160 --> 02:43.598
- God, I'm so thirsty.
-Yeah.

02:43.641 --> 02:45.034
Well, that's the cinnamon
in the churro.

02:45.077 --> 02:47.036
-That'll make you thirsty.
- You know what?

02:47.079 --> 02:49.299
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna update the group.

02:50.474 --> 02:52.563
-Why are you texting that?

02:52.607 --> 02:56.350
Oh, well, I just wanted to, uh,update the group on my status.

02:56.393 --> 02:58.308
Yeah, but that's, like,
a sexual thing, man.

02:58.352 --> 02:59.440
That means you're thirsting
for something,

02:59.483 --> 03:00.919
which means you're horny for it.

03:02.399 --> 03:04.227
Dennis is funny
with the texts, man.

03:04.271 --> 03:05.228
Huh.

03:05.272 --> 03:07.622
Aw, come on. Too late, Dee.

03:07.665 --> 03:09.624
Goddamn it. Where is Frank?

03:09.667 --> 03:11.452
I'm just... You know what?
I'm just gonna text him again,

03:11.495 --> 03:12.888
'cause I don't know
what the hell's going on.

03:12.931 --> 03:14.455
Where you be?

03:14.498 --> 03:16.283
Huh.

03:16.326 --> 03:17.936
What does that mean? He's...

03:17.980 --> 03:20.591
-It's a dancing woman,
a smiley face and a gun.
-Oh.

03:20.635 --> 03:22.158
I know what that means.

03:22.202 --> 03:25.161
He's stuck behind a woman driverand he wants to shoot himself.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.728
-Oh.
-Mm-hmm.

03:26.771 --> 03:29.600
All right. Well, I'm just
gonna update everybody.

03:29.644 --> 03:31.602
-"Late."
-Yeah, but come on, man.

03:31.646 --> 03:33.865
You keep sending updates
with no new information.

03:33.909 --> 03:36.172
No, no, I'm just keeping
the whole group updated

03:36.216 --> 03:38.392
the way a meerkat might.

03:38.435 --> 03:39.958
Yeah, but a meerkat's efficientin how it updates.

03:40.002 --> 03:41.308
You know what I mean?
Like, one little chirp,

03:41.351 --> 03:43.745
it can warn a whole group of,
like, an eagle or whatever.

03:43.788 --> 03:45.529
It doesn't need to,
like, chirp over

03:45.573 --> 03:47.183
and over and over again,
you know?

03:47.227 --> 03:49.533
I-I'm sorry, a-are you schoolingme on meerkat knowledge?

03:49.577 --> 03:51.492
-Seems like I have to.
-Oh, oh, is that right?

03:51.535 --> 03:52.841
Well, first of all,
smarty-pants,

03:52.884 --> 03:54.712
they don't chirp.
They chirrup.

03:54.756 --> 03:56.714
Oh, yeah? You think you know
a ton about the meerkat?

03:56.758 --> 03:58.890
Well, did you know that
the alpha pair will scent-mark

03:58.934 --> 04:00.675
the subordinate to show
that it's the leader?

04:00.718 --> 04:03.199
If they find the weak one,they start pissing all over it.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.331
Yes. Of course I know that,
Charlie.

04:04.374 --> 04:05.897
We watched the same documentary.

04:05.941 --> 04:08.117
By the way, I'm not the onethat passed out halfway through

04:08.160 --> 04:09.336
and scent-marked
all over himself.

04:09.379 --> 04:11.207
-I drank a case of beer, man.
-So did I.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.383
-I also drank a case of beer,
and I didn't piss myself.

04:13.427 --> 04:14.732
All I'm saying is
you don't have to text, like,

04:14.776 --> 04:16.517
-every three seconds, you know?-

04:16.560 --> 04:18.432
Aw, goddamn it.
Where is Frank? I just...

04:18.475 --> 04:19.954
-You're gonna text it again?
-Yeah, I'm gonna...

04:19.998 --> 04:21.696
-I just got to make sure
everybody knows.
-It just means that you're...

04:21.738 --> 04:23.306
you want... you're horny. Oh.

04:23.350 --> 04:25.221
Ah, Dennis g...
Dennis nailed it.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.441
-What-what does that mean?
-A peach is a butt.

04:27.484 --> 04:29.007
You're horny for a butt.

04:29.051 --> 04:31.227
-I'm-I'm horny for a butt?
-'Cause you're gay.
-FRANK: Hey-o!

04:31.271 --> 04:32.576
-Sorry I'm late. I had...
-Oh.

04:32.620 --> 04:35.013
...had to get a bag of bananas
so I could taunt the gorilla.

04:35.057 --> 04:37.015
It took you two hours
to get bananas?

04:37.059 --> 04:39.148
Yeah, well, I was stuck
behind that woman driver.

04:39.191 --> 04:40.541
I thought I texted you that.

04:40.584 --> 04:41.585
Yeah, we got that.

04:41.629 --> 04:42.760
-Let's just go inside.
-I...

04:42.804 --> 04:44.675
Aw, c... Too late, Dee. Come on.

04:44.719 --> 04:46.329
-She sucks.
-Pick up the pace with it,

04:46.373 --> 04:47.896
-you know?
-She sucks.

04:47.939 --> 04:50.464
-I texted a peach.
-I already did that, Dee.

04:50.507 --> 04:52.466
Oh, yeah. There it is.

04:52.509 --> 04:54.163
You know, speed's very importantin comedy texting, Dee.

04:54.206 --> 04:55.947
If it looks like you thought
about it for a while,

04:55.991 --> 04:56.948
it's pretty lame.

04:56.992 --> 04:58.559
-Yeah. I know.
-Yeah.

04:58.602 --> 05:01.562
Ooh, you know what I'll do?
I'll do a fist. Right?

05:01.605 --> 05:03.955
So it's like he's thirsty fora fist in the butt.

05:03.999 --> 05:06.131
I don't think
anybody's gonna get that.

05:06.175 --> 05:08.438
You know? Plus, the moment
is long gone. I mean...

05:08.482 --> 05:10.440
-Goddamn it. What...

05:10.484 --> 05:12.355
No, that... I was wrong.
That was funny. I...

05:12.399 --> 05:13.617
Oh, Dee.

05:13.661 --> 05:15.750
Well, you guys are too fast
on this thing.

05:16.881 --> 05:18.448
-Don't answer. I got this.
-Let me just...

05:18.492 --> 05:20.276
-I can... No, no! No.
-But you're... Okay, go, go.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.886
I got it, I got it. Okay.

05:25.499 --> 05:27.370
What's a... funny thing I can...

05:27.414 --> 05:29.198
Oh, my God. Stop. I...

05:31.809 --> 05:33.376
-Go.
-Well, I mean...

05:33.420 --> 05:34.508
-Look at that.
-Yeah, but...

05:34.551 --> 05:36.031
-Quick. Concise. Job done.
-Whatever.

05:36.074 --> 05:37.511
-Okay.
-No confusion.

05:40.557 --> 05:42.646
-All right.
Sea lions, here we are.
-Okay.

05:42.690 --> 05:44.518
-All right. Where are they?
-Yeah.

05:44.561 --> 05:45.388
I don't know.

05:51.699 --> 05:53.527
-Mm?
-Wait a minute.

05:53.570 --> 05:55.398
-He said in front.
He's not in front.
-Eh.

05:55.442 --> 05:57.400
-Exhibit ent...
-Entrance?

05:57.444 --> 05:59.576
Oh, come on.
I got to go rescue these guys

05:59.620 --> 06:01.317
at the exhibit entrance?
Excuse me, sir?

06:01.361 --> 06:02.884
Sir? Yeah.

06:02.927 --> 06:05.234
Um, h-how long do we have
till the lion begins feeding?

06:05.277 --> 06:06.670
Uh, we're five minutes out.

06:06.714 --> 06:08.672
Five minutes out? Okay.Thank you, thank you. All right.

06:08.716 --> 06:10.282
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Slowdown. I don't want to get lost.

06:10.326 --> 06:11.980
No, I will not adjust my gait
to accommodate

06:12.023 --> 06:13.895
your weird insecurities
about sheep.

06:13.938 --> 06:15.679
It was a goat,
and it was a lunatic.

06:15.723 --> 06:16.637
Its eyes were going
in every direction.

06:16.680 --> 06:18.073
Oh, were they? Fascinating.

06:18.116 --> 06:19.422
-Tell me more!
-He pounced on me,

06:19.466 --> 06:21.642
and then all of his friends
moved in for the kill.

06:21.685 --> 06:23.426
-Ooh! Terrifying. Ooh!
-Don't do that.

06:23.470 --> 06:24.427
It was so scary!

06:29.301 --> 06:30.694
-Oh.
-What does that mean?

06:30.738 --> 06:33.001
Shit, he's-he's having fun
without us.

06:33.044 --> 06:35.569
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Mac, that's sarcastic.

06:35.612 --> 06:38.485
If he was having fun, it would
have an exclamation point.

06:38.528 --> 06:40.574
I'm gonna de-escalate.
I'm gonna de-escalate.

06:40.617 --> 06:42.619
-Probably pissed
he can't find us.
-Wait.

06:45.709 --> 06:47.145
-Oh, shit.
-What does that mean?

06:47.189 --> 06:48.712
-Oh...
-That's not g...
What it means is

06:48.756 --> 06:50.105
that he's already given
the information

06:50.148 --> 06:51.585
and he doesn't want
to have to repeat himself.

06:51.628 --> 06:53.325
-So you got to scroll up
and see.
-So, what... Scroll up.

06:53.369 --> 06:54.457
-Scroll up.-Dennis hates to repeat himself.

06:54.501 --> 06:56.024
Well, let's find what he's...

06:56.067 --> 06:57.895
Ah.

06:57.939 --> 07:00.507
"Went to C lions."

07:00.550 --> 07:02.726
Oh. Shit.

07:02.770 --> 07:04.946
Dude, do you think
he went to the sea lions

07:04.989 --> 07:06.600
or he went to go seethe lion?

07:06.643 --> 07:08.689
-Ooh...
-Oh. I don't know.

07:08.732 --> 07:10.212
I don't know. Let me ask.

07:13.128 --> 07:14.477
Oh. Yeah, yeah, I...

07:14.521 --> 07:16.087
What'd you get wrong there?

07:19.656 --> 07:22.616
-Sea.  Um...
-Dude, just let me, all right?

07:22.659 --> 07:23.834
-Well, it's-it's
the predictive te...
-It's better...

07:23.878 --> 07:25.662
it's better with pictures.

07:27.664 --> 07:29.666
-Went to sea lion or...
-Lions.

07:30.885 --> 07:32.974
...see a lion?

07:33.017 --> 07:34.410
Right.

07:35.803 --> 07:37.500
-Oh. He's mad.
-Oh, no, but...
-Yeah.

07:37.544 --> 07:39.284
-No.
-No, it's got
an exclamation point.

07:39.328 --> 07:40.851
-That means it's happy.
-No, it's all...
-He's-he's screaming at you.

07:40.895 --> 07:42.505
-Yeah, it's all caps.
-It's all caps.
-Screaming?

07:42.549 --> 07:44.420
-Yeah. That's not good.
-That's...

07:44.464 --> 07:46.248
What is this?

07:47.597 --> 07:49.077
-What-what is...
-What does that mean?

07:49.120 --> 07:51.209
What does that mean? I don't
know. Dee-Dee sucks, man.

07:51.253 --> 07:52.515
-I don't know.
-She-she sucks.

07:52.559 --> 07:54.343
-All right, watch this.

07:54.386 --> 07:55.649
How about that
with the eggplant?

07:55.692 --> 07:56.998
-Oh. Ooh. We're coming.
-All right, let's go.

07:57.041 --> 07:58.695
-All right, let's go.
-Yeah.

07:58.739 --> 08:01.089
Oh, yeah. "We're coming."

08:01.132 --> 08:02.525
Charlie made it work.

08:02.569 --> 08:03.657
-Oh.
-Nice. Nice.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.093
Idiots went
to the wrong exhibit.

08:05.136 --> 08:06.442
All right,
let-let-let's get back there.

08:06.486 --> 08:07.574
I don't want to miss anything.
Come on.

08:07.617 --> 08:09.532
Okay. All right.
Well, stop walking like...

08:09.576 --> 08:12.230
Hey, pal. How's it going?

08:12.274 --> 08:13.754
Uh... where's the lion?

08:13.797 --> 08:15.103
-Are we close? Are we close?
-Oh.

08:15.146 --> 08:16.757
Yeah, you just missed it.
Yeah, he's fed.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.541
-He's back in his cage.
-Oh.

08:18.585 --> 08:20.804
He ate the kill?
He-he devoured the kill?

08:20.848 --> 08:22.806
-And I wasn't here?
-No, the feeding. Yeah, yeah.

08:22.850 --> 08:24.808
-You just missed it.
It was awesome.
-No.

08:24.852 --> 08:26.897
Man, you said
we were five minutes out.

08:26.941 --> 08:28.899
-Yeah, right.
-Yeah, but that was only
ten minutes ago.

08:28.943 --> 08:30.466
C-Correct.

08:30.510 --> 08:31.685
No, but nobody does it that way.

08:31.728 --> 08:34.470
The five minutes means
20 minutes, man. You can't...

08:34.514 --> 08:35.993
-It's the whole reason I'm here!-Uh...

08:36.037 --> 08:37.604
Yeah, I don't know
what to tell you.

08:37.647 --> 08:39.736
Hey, man. You missed it.
It was awesome.

08:39.780 --> 08:42.957
-Uh-huh. Yeah.
-Oh.

08:47.831 --> 08:49.572
-Uh...

08:49.616 --> 08:51.705
Oh, oh. He's thanking us
for something, so that's good.

08:51.748 --> 08:53.402
Dude, how are you
so bad at this, man?

08:53.445 --> 08:55.404
He probably missed the feeding.He's blaming us.

08:55.447 --> 08:56.623
-Yeah.
-What?

08:56.666 --> 08:57.841
Shit. You think?

08:57.885 --> 08:59.626
-Yeah.
-Probably.

08:59.669 --> 09:01.149
No. Hold on.

09:01.192 --> 09:03.717
I'm just gonna send him
something real quick

09:03.760 --> 09:05.066
and make sure
everything's all good.

09:05.109 --> 09:06.415
-Mm.
-Oh, yeah.

09:06.458 --> 09:07.590
He says he's great,
so we're fine.

09:07.634 --> 09:09.418
-Dude.

09:09.461 --> 09:11.507
-He's screaming at you, man.
-Yeah.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.813
Screaming?

09:12.856 --> 09:14.292
Dude, this whole texting thing
is your idea,

09:14.336 --> 09:15.859
and you don't know
how texting works?

09:15.903 --> 09:17.078
No, he's... He just did it
in all capitals.

09:17.121 --> 09:18.645
-That's screaming.
-That's a scream.

09:18.688 --> 09:20.864
-That's what you do
when you're screaming.
-That's not scream...

09:20.908 --> 09:22.649
This is just all
one big misunderstanding

09:22.692 --> 09:25.086
due to the sea lions, all right?I know what to do.

09:25.129 --> 09:26.783
I'm just gonna
speak from the heart.

09:26.827 --> 09:28.959
Let me just text
s-something from the heart

09:29.003 --> 09:31.701
that he's gonna understand,
something a little bit...

09:31.745 --> 09:33.442
-All right.
-Mmm.

09:33.485 --> 09:34.835
Smell good.

09:34.878 --> 09:37.533
Not really normal to the...
if I...

09:37.577 --> 09:39.970
-Come on.
-Is there a...?

09:40.014 --> 09:42.494
What rhymes with "limber"?
What rhymes with it?

09:43.713 --> 09:45.541
-Hinder.
-How do you not get "timber"?

09:45.585 --> 09:47.543
-Timber.
-Timber. And...

09:47.587 --> 09:49.023
-Oh. Salutations.
-And send.

09:49.066 --> 09:50.328
-Okay.
-Ah, dude.

09:50.372 --> 09:51.852
So, let's just
give him a chance.

09:51.895 --> 09:53.201
He's probably gonna take
some time and respond to...

09:53.244 --> 09:54.550
-Oh!

09:54.594 --> 09:56.030
-Yeah.
-Uh, "K."

09:56.073 --> 09:59.076
- You're dead to him.-Yeah, he's blowing you off,man.

09:59.120 --> 10:00.730
-"K" means "okay."
-He is pissed, dude.
-"K."

10:00.774 --> 10:01.905
-Yeah.
-He is...
-"K" means "okay."

10:01.949 --> 10:03.907
-No.
-He didn't even bother
to read your thing!

10:03.951 --> 10:05.430
-He just sent "K."
-How could he possibly
read that whole...?

10:05.474 --> 10:07.128
-He read it!
-He is pissed off at you.

10:07.171 --> 10:08.999
-Dennis is the fastest reader
in America.
-Can we just...?

10:09.043 --> 10:10.261
-Oh, now he's calling me.

10:10.305 --> 10:11.567
-He's calling?
-Oh, good. Good, good, yeah.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.047
You could just text, but no.
Call me, call me!

10:13.090 --> 10:15.571
-I want to hear from you.
-Okay. You're gonna like this.

10:17.747 --> 10:20.097
-Uh, what is that?
-I called him the "F" word.

10:20.141 --> 10:22.230
It's a bundle of sticks.

10:22.273 --> 10:24.798
No. Dee, no. You can't do that.That's not funny.

10:24.841 --> 10:25.712
Okay, y-you can't say that word.

10:25.755 --> 10:27.148
I didn't say the word.
I did the pictures.

10:27.191 --> 10:28.715
But it doesn't matter.
That's offensive, okay?

10:28.758 --> 10:31.065
And it's off-putting, and
it's not a good color on you.

10:31.108 --> 10:32.806
Blue? You're gonna go blue?
Don't go blue.

10:32.849 --> 10:34.634
That tells me that
you're just not funny at all.

10:35.722 --> 10:37.593
- Yeah.
-What?

10:37.637 --> 10:39.943
Frank nailing it again.

10:41.945 --> 10:43.468
What's so funny
about what you did?

10:43.512 --> 10:45.470
Well, it works
on two levels, Dee.

10:45.514 --> 10:46.950
It-it says that,
uh, Frank's on fire

10:46.994 --> 10:48.952
and also that, uh,
Mac is a raging flamer,

10:48.996 --> 10:50.954
which is still
totally acceptable, for now.

10:50.998 --> 10:53.130
I have an idea. I have an idea.Check this out.

10:55.785 --> 10:56.830
What is that?

10:56.873 --> 10:59.180
I'm joking that maybe
we should get the Jew lawyer

10:59.223 --> 11:01.922
and have an arbitration aboutwhat words we can and can't use

11:01.965 --> 11:03.967
to describe Mac's sexuality.

11:06.796 --> 11:08.624
Cool! Super funny

11:08.668 --> 11:10.539
and not the least bit
anti-Semitic.

11:10.582 --> 11:12.933
You get it!
You get it.

11:12.976 --> 11:14.108
Should we just get out of here?

11:14.151 --> 11:15.631
-Let's do that.
-Yeah. Well, hold on.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.764
-Well, okay, but hang on.

11:17.807 --> 11:19.635
Wait, Dennis.
Hey, excuse me.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.202
Whoa! Whoa, whoa.
Dennis, wait, wait,

11:21.245 --> 11:23.857
wait, wait, wait, wait.
Okay. Where'd you go?

11:23.900 --> 11:25.859
Where'd you go? Oh, no.

11:25.902 --> 11:27.991
Oh, no.

11:28.035 --> 11:29.601
Dennis!

11:31.255 --> 11:34.084
Why won't Dennis
answer my calls?

11:34.128 --> 11:36.391
Dude, who cares? Man, I'm
so sick of this texting shit.

11:36.434 --> 11:39.002
-Come on.
-It's like we're not even
enjoying the zoo, man.

11:39.046 --> 11:40.569
-No see no animals.
-"Missed your calls."

11:40.612 --> 11:42.005
-That's what it is.
-Jesus Christ.

11:42.049 --> 11:43.006
-Oh, dude, he...
-He missed them.

11:43.050 --> 11:44.747
-He's lying to you.
-He's avoiding you.

11:44.791 --> 11:46.227
Look, can we just
go see the meerkats?

11:46.270 --> 11:47.445
-Please? Let's just drop it.

11:47.489 --> 11:48.795
We'll go to the meerkats.
We'll have fun.

11:48.838 --> 11:50.971
I want to go taunt the gorillasbefore they get fed

11:51.014 --> 11:52.320
and they're not hungry anymore.

11:52.363 --> 11:54.365
Why do you even want to taunt
a gorilla? What is that?

11:54.409 --> 11:55.453
Oh, it's hysterical.

11:55.497 --> 11:57.629
I sit there,
eat a banana real slow,

11:57.673 --> 11:58.979
and he comes up to the glass,

11:59.022 --> 12:01.938
and he's banging on the glass
like the dumb ape he is.

12:01.982 --> 12:05.376
It will bang its hands bloody
trying to get the banana.

12:05.420 --> 12:06.682
How is that funny?

12:06.726 --> 12:09.685
It's funny 'cause
he can't get the banana.

12:09.729 --> 12:10.991
All right, dude. You know what?

12:11.034 --> 12:12.470
Go ahead. Go taunt the gorillas,all right?

12:12.514 --> 12:14.472
But I'm going to the meerkats.
I'm not going with you.

12:14.516 --> 12:16.387
Suit yourself.

12:16.431 --> 12:17.693
All right,
can we just go to the meer...?

12:17.737 --> 12:18.912
What are you doing now?

12:18.955 --> 12:19.826
-What is this?-I'm just sending one last text.

12:19.869 --> 12:21.349
You're gonna send another gi...Another gi...

12:21.392 --> 12:23.655
-Okay, it's gonna take
a little bit of... Oh!
-Oh.

12:23.699 --> 12:25.005
Oh, he read that so fast.

12:25.048 --> 12:26.397
-He didn't read it at all!
-I think...

12:26.441 --> 12:28.051
Dude, he doesn't want
to talk to you!

12:28.095 --> 12:29.836
Can we just please
go to the meerkats, dude?

12:29.879 --> 12:30.837
No. You know what I'm gonna do?

12:30.880 --> 12:33.143
I'm just gonna hang out
in the bathroom for a while.

12:33.187 --> 12:35.493
You're gonna hang out
in the bathroom?

12:35.537 --> 12:37.844
-Yeah, for a while.
-Why?

12:37.887 --> 12:39.715
It's a gay thing, so you reallywouldn't understand.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.151
-What?
-Yeah, you know, it's, like,

12:41.195 --> 12:43.284
bathrooms at zoos are, like,

12:43.327 --> 12:45.808
big Grindr spots
for closeted dads.

12:45.852 --> 12:47.679
Dude, I know what's up here.
You're ditching me, man.

12:47.723 --> 12:49.029
You're-you're ditching me

12:49.072 --> 12:50.944
so you can go beg forgiveness
from Dennis, dude.

12:50.987 --> 12:52.859
-It's so pathetic, man.
-No, I am not, Charlie.

12:52.902 --> 12:54.643
-It's so pathetic, dude.
Dude, you're no meerkat.
-I am not!

12:54.686 --> 12:56.514
-I'm not doing th...
I am a... Don't...
-I'll tell you...

12:56.558 --> 12:57.864
-You're nota meerkat.

12:57.907 --> 12:59.169
-Don't be...
-Meerkats stick together, Mac!

12:59.213 --> 13:00.431
Don't be like that, Charlie.

13:00.475 --> 13:02.172
Of course I'm a meerkat,
all right?

13:02.216 --> 13:03.957
Bullshit! Then why aren't you
hanging with me?!

13:04.000 --> 13:06.089
I just want to go meet my needsreal quick...

13:06.133 --> 13:07.743
What about the needs
of the group, Mac?

13:07.787 --> 13:09.745
I'm gonna meet the needs ofthe group, Charlie, after that,

13:09.789 --> 13:10.964
-but I just feel like...
Are you...

13:11.007 --> 13:12.269
are you pissing on me?!

13:12.313 --> 13:13.967
-Yeah.
-Oh, uh...

13:14.010 --> 13:15.272
Direct eye contact?

13:15.316 --> 13:16.273
Yeah!

13:19.886 --> 13:22.105
-Your neck's very high.
-Yeah.

13:22.149 --> 13:23.759
-Okay, I'm done.
-Oh.

13:26.109 --> 13:27.937
Don't look at me.

14:00.013 --> 14:02.015
Goddamn it!

14:18.858 --> 14:20.163
Dennis.

14:20.207 --> 14:21.817
Y-You came to talk to me.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.732
Unless this is, like,
a Grindr situation?

14:23.775 --> 14:24.864
I came to piss.

14:25.995 --> 14:27.823
Look, man, I know
that you're mad at me,

14:27.867 --> 14:29.477
but when you said that thing
about "C lions,"

14:29.520 --> 14:31.958
-Charlie was like...
-Oh, that's a lie.

14:32.001 --> 14:34.177
That's just a lie,
because Charlie can't read.

14:34.221 --> 14:36.919
All right, it was all my fault,but it was an honest mistake.

14:36.963 --> 14:38.181
One thing, Mac.

14:38.225 --> 14:40.923
I mean, I came here
to see one goddamn thing,

14:40.967 --> 14:42.969
and you ruined it
with your texting nonsense.

14:43.012 --> 14:44.971
Yes, but I have
some new information.

14:45.014 --> 14:47.625
There's going to be
another live feeding.

14:49.889 --> 14:52.065
-Go on.
-Yeah.

14:52.108 --> 14:54.154
A goat is to be sacrificed.

14:54.197 --> 14:56.721
I heard an employee in here.
He was talking about it.

14:56.765 --> 15:00.203
-Now, I offered to blow him,
but he was like, "Nah, I'm..."
-Goat?

15:02.423 --> 15:05.034
That's some Jurassic Parkshit.I like it.

15:07.471 --> 15:08.777
But if you're gonna join me,

15:08.820 --> 15:10.866
you must follow my every commandbecause, I swear to God,

15:10.910 --> 15:12.868
if you make me
miss this one, too,

15:12.912 --> 15:16.350
I will feed you
to the lions myself.

15:16.393 --> 15:18.134
Okay.

15:19.657 --> 15:21.137
Are you pissing on me?

15:21.181 --> 15:23.313
Yeah.

15:25.228 --> 15:27.578
You guys grinding?

15:27.622 --> 15:30.277
Ah.

15:31.278 --> 15:32.975
Hey!
Where you a...

15:33.019 --> 15:35.804
Where you at,
you big, dumb baboon?

15:35.847 --> 15:38.807
Huh?

15:38.850 --> 15:40.026
Uh, excuse me.

15:40.069 --> 15:43.116
Excuse me.
Where's the, uh...

15:43.159 --> 15:45.988
Where's the big animal?
The-- Uh.

15:46.032 --> 15:48.338
Ah. Annoying bird.

15:48.382 --> 15:49.818
-The what?
-Nah.

15:49.861 --> 15:52.038
No, it's just the phones are...they're so distracting.

15:52.081 --> 15:55.128
Now, where's the big, dumb,
you know, the ape, the animal?

15:55.171 --> 15:56.259
The-the-the silverback?

15:56.303 --> 15:57.782
Yeah, the dummy. Yeah.

15:57.826 --> 15:59.132
Yeah. Uh, well, that's Andy.
Uh, Andy...

15:59.175 --> 16:01.047
-Andy the dummy.
-: Yeah.

16:01.090 --> 16:02.918
-He can be pretty shy.
-Yeah... He can be... Yeah.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.050
So, yeah.
So, sometimes you have to

16:04.093 --> 16:05.703
-look to find him 'cause...
-Ah... Oh, excuse me.

16:05.747 --> 16:08.924
-What does this bitch...

16:08.968 --> 16:11.057
What is she talking about?

16:11.100 --> 16:13.276
I...

16:13.320 --> 16:16.062
Hey! Hey!

16:16.105 --> 16:17.150
Hey!

16:17.193 --> 16:19.369
You big, dumb...
Where's my bananas?!

16:19.413 --> 16:21.719
Son of a...

16:21.763 --> 16:23.156
You bastard!

16:23.199 --> 16:24.505
Give me those bananas!

16:36.256 --> 16:38.301
Come on.

17:02.151 --> 17:04.153
Learn to read, idiot.

17:12.291 --> 17:13.554
Goddamn it!

17:13.597 --> 17:15.251
-Okay.

17:15.295 --> 17:17.775
So, this should be getting
started any minute.

17:17.819 --> 17:19.994
I'm gonna drop a quick pin
because I think the guys

17:20.039 --> 17:21.344
-are gonna want to see this.
-Yeah.

17:21.387 --> 17:23.259
You know, I got to say,
something feels a little off

17:23.303 --> 17:25.914
to me a-about all this.
W-Why are we in the exhibit?

17:25.957 --> 17:27.220
That doesn't feel safe,
you know.

17:27.262 --> 17:30.310
And why are a bunch of childrenin the exhibit as well?

17:30.353 --> 17:32.964
Yes, that does seem
a little strange, doesn't it?

17:33.008 --> 17:35.271
DENNIS:
Hi-hi. Uh, sir? Excuse me.

17:35.315 --> 17:37.360
Uh, yeah.

17:37.404 --> 17:39.275
When is the goat
to be slaughtered?

17:39.319 --> 17:41.234
Excuse me?

17:41.277 --> 17:44.150
When is the goat
going to be fed to the lion?

17:44.193 --> 17:47.022
Uh, my friend engaged in asexual exchange for information

17:47.066 --> 17:49.372
and was told there was
going to be a sacrifice.

17:49.416 --> 17:51.766
Well, he tried but I said no.

17:51.809 --> 17:53.159
-Oh, that's...
-It's not what you think.

17:53.202 --> 17:55.770
I think there's beensome miscommunication.

17:55.813 --> 17:57.380
This is the-the petting zoo.

17:57.424 --> 18:00.514
We're feeding the goats.
We're not slaughtering them.

18:04.561 --> 18:07.260
Uh...

18:07.303 --> 18:09.088
-Dennis, I, uh...
-It's fine.

18:11.046 --> 18:13.266
No, it's fine, Mac.

18:13.309 --> 18:15.833
This is all fine.

18:15.877 --> 18:18.836
-Why don't we just go
to the next exhibit.
-Oh.

18:18.880 --> 18:21.317
Cool. Yeah, I thought you wereactually gonna be upset with me.

18:23.667 --> 18:25.191

18:27.106 --> 18:29.412

18:29.456 --> 18:32.763

18:42.686 --> 18:45.080
-No. What's this?
-Okay, kids.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.081
Let's go!

18:47.213 --> 18:48.431

19:10.497 --> 19:12.455
No, get away from me.
