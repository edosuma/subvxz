WEBVTT

02:22.851 --> 02:23.810
It's late.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.187
I'm gonna call it a night.

02:38.283 --> 02:41.578
I don't need any details,
but you really like this girl?

02:42.620 --> 02:43.454
Uh...

02:45.415 --> 02:46.457
I do, yeah.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.043
And you've got... protection?

02:50.461 --> 02:51.546
Yes, Dad.

02:52.547 --> 02:54.048
-Jeez, what?
-I'm just saying.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.009
Be smart.

02:56.634 --> 02:57.844
Good night.

02:58.928 --> 02:59.888
Good night.

03:05.935 --> 03:07.312
Is everything okay?

03:10.356 --> 03:12.442
Yeah, my dad's just being weird.

03:14.611 --> 03:16.571
That carnival opens up tomorrow night.

03:18.239 --> 03:19.240
You wanna go?

03:20.658 --> 03:23.995
Maybe they have a tunnel of love?

03:26.247 --> 03:27.957
I was thinking the same thing.

03:38.176 --> 03:40.470
<i>♪ You call the shots, babe ♪</i>

03:40.803 --> 03:43.181
<i>♪ I just wanna be yours ♪</i>

03:45.016 --> 03:48.269
<i>♪ Secrets I have held in my heart ♪</i>

03:48.353 --> 03:51.689
<i>♪ Are harder to hide than I thought ♪</i>

03:51.773 --> 03:53.650
Think we could stay here forever?

03:56.069 --> 03:57.403
What about the world?

03:58.529 --> 03:59.697
Wouldn't we be missed?

04:00.323 --> 04:01.366
I don't care.

04:02.325 --> 04:06.871
I'm just so, so happy you're here.

04:08.289 --> 04:09.290
With me.

04:11.334 --> 04:12.335
Thanks to you.

04:14.629 --> 04:15.630
Only to you.

04:18.716 --> 04:20.593
And now that I have you back,

04:21.928 --> 04:23.638
I'm never letting you go.

04:32.981 --> 04:34.190
Sweet dreams.

04:47.996 --> 04:50.123
- Nick?

04:50.873 --> 04:52.500
Nick, what's wrong?

04:53.710 --> 04:55.253
-You're okay.
-No.

04:55.336 --> 04:57.714
-It's just a nightmare. Shh.
-It was him.

04:57.797 --> 04:58.631
No.

04:58.715 --> 04:59.674
He was here.

05:01.509 --> 05:02.719
The Dark Lord.

05:02.802 --> 05:03.845
No.

05:03.928 --> 05:04.971
No, he's not.

05:06.055 --> 05:08.099
He is far away.

05:08.683 --> 05:10.018
He can't hurt you anymore.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.566
Everything's gonna be all right now.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.204
It's okay.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.543
No, no, Roz...

05:36.169 --> 05:37.253
Nick's doing great.

05:38.421 --> 05:39.547
It's just...

05:42.842 --> 05:44.427
I wanna spend the day with him.

05:44.510 --> 05:50.224
Like the whole day, so I was hoping
you could maybe cover for me at school?

05:50.308 --> 05:52.393
<i>-We're talking about the carnival.</i>
-A carnival tonight?

05:52.477 --> 05:54.228
Yeah, that sounds amazing.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.066
<i>-I have a ride.</i>
<i>-</i>Sure.

05:58.524 --> 06:00.193
When and where shall we meet you?

06:01.277 --> 06:02.362
See you then.

06:10.953 --> 06:11.829
Babe?

06:11.913 --> 06:13.623
-I'm gonna go to breakfast.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.750
Will you come down when you're done?

06:16.417 --> 06:17.418
Absolutely.

06:33.351 --> 06:34.268
<i>No!</i>

06:40.566 --> 06:41.442
<i>No!</i>

06:43.611 --> 06:46.364
So, how's poor Nicholas doing, darling?

06:47.156 --> 06:48.408
Here we go.

06:48.491 --> 06:50.743
-As well as can be expected.
-Yeah?

06:50.827 --> 06:52.328
How's his little foot?

06:52.703 --> 06:57.417
Well, his malformation is a remnant
of having the Dark Lord inside him.

06:58.126 --> 07:01.129
Um... given enough time,
it should revert back on its own.

07:01.963 --> 07:03.005
Probably.

07:04.257 --> 07:07.260
Well, you must be so happy
now that he's back in your arms,

07:07.343 --> 07:08.678
all safe and cozy?

07:08.761 --> 07:10.346
And in your bed.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.640
I imagine it was quite the reunion.

07:12.723 --> 07:15.560
All we did was talk
and hold each other, Aunt Zee,

07:15.643 --> 07:17.395
and that is all I'm gonna say about that.

07:17.478 --> 07:19.605
Well, then, I know what we can discuss.

07:20.481 --> 07:23.734
The sheer insolence of you going to Hell
without our permission.

07:24.235 --> 07:25.736
You could have been killed.

07:25.820 --> 07:27.947
You could have gotten your friends killed.

07:28.489 --> 07:29.949
Oh, honestly.

07:30.032 --> 07:32.452
First Purgatory, now Hell.
What's next? Heaven?

07:32.535 --> 07:36.247
Bet you missed this while you were gone.
Breakfast with a side of inquisition.

07:36.330 --> 07:37.915
Ambrose, as you know,

07:37.999 --> 07:40.293
we've reopened the Academy
in your absence,

07:40.376 --> 07:41.461
and we're short of teachers.

07:41.544 --> 07:44.297
I cannot be a teacher if that is
what you're asking me, Auntie Zee.

07:45.047 --> 07:45.923
Why can't you?

07:47.425 --> 07:49.927
The thing is,

07:51.012 --> 07:55.016
my time abroad has illuminated me
to everything I do not know.

07:55.099 --> 07:57.977
Magicks beyond our experience
and imagination.

07:58.060 --> 08:01.856
If I'm to be a master of the mystic arts,
I must read, I must research.

08:01.939 --> 08:04.025
Well, then, you can be
the Academy's librarian.

08:04.442 --> 08:05.485
What about Cassius?

08:05.568 --> 08:07.695
Oh. He's on death's doorstep.

08:07.778 --> 08:08.946
-Hmm.

08:10.364 --> 08:11.532
Zelda?

08:12.033 --> 08:13.451
Are you coming down with a cold?

08:13.534 --> 08:16.078
How dare you?
I've never been sick a day in my life.

08:19.749 --> 08:22.126
- Morning, everyone.
-Morning, my darling.

08:22.210 --> 08:24.378
Hey, have a seat. I've saved you a plate.

08:24.462 --> 08:27.465
No, that's all right, Ms. Spellman,
I'm not really hungry.

08:27.548 --> 08:30.468
Actually, we should get going.
Nick's walking me to school.

08:30.551 --> 08:32.720
And then straight to the Academy, I hope.

08:32.887 --> 08:35.389
You've been gone too long, Mr. Scratch.

08:35.473 --> 08:37.266
And Sabrina, I'll be expecting you

08:37.350 --> 08:39.227
as soon as your day
at Baxter High is finished.

08:39.310 --> 08:42.313
-3:30, shall we say?
- Absolutely.

08:42.396 --> 08:43.439
I'll be there.

08:48.444 --> 08:51.280
Obviously, we're not going
to the Academy today.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.032
And I'm not going to Baxter High.

08:53.115 --> 08:54.408
-We're not?
-No.

08:55.159 --> 08:56.160
We're playing hooky.

08:56.244 --> 08:59.455
I just got you back.
I wanna spend the whole day with you.

08:59.539 --> 09:02.291
And then Roz said
there's a carnival opening tonight.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.293
-How does that sound?
- Divine.

09:05.044 --> 09:06.837
But simply not meant to be.

09:07.505 --> 09:08.506
Lilith.

09:08.589 --> 09:10.091
Mr. Scratch, did you miss me?

09:10.174 --> 09:12.093
You won't take me back.
I'd sooner die first.

09:12.176 --> 09:14.845
I'm not here for you.
Sabrina is needed at court.

09:14.929 --> 09:16.180
-Sabrina is?
-I am?

09:16.264 --> 09:18.099
Why would Sabrina be needed in Hell?

09:20.184 --> 09:23.938
It's a long story,
but in order to get you out of Hell,

09:24.021 --> 09:25.606
I had to...

09:26.816 --> 09:27.900
claim the throne.

09:30.528 --> 09:32.363
So you did as Lucifer asked?

09:33.531 --> 09:34.615
You're Queen of Hell?

09:34.699 --> 09:37.326
Well, technically, yes, but not really.

09:37.410 --> 09:40.329
I made Lilith my regent
so she could handle the day-to-day.

09:40.413 --> 09:45.167
Yes, but you foolishly threatened
the Infernal Court with a reformation.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.753
And now they're demanding
to hear your plans.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.797
They've gathered
at Pandemonium, so if you--

09:49.880 --> 09:52.383
Oh, I'm not going.
I have plans with Nick.

09:53.843 --> 09:56.887
As regent, there's only so much I can do.

09:56.971 --> 09:58.514
That's fine, but like I said--

09:58.598 --> 09:59.849
I think you should go.

10:02.018 --> 10:03.853
- What?
-That is,

10:03.936 --> 10:06.397
I mean, if this is something
that you need to do--

10:06.480 --> 10:07.565
It is.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.318
I don't feel right about leaving you.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.361
Sabrina...

10:14.155 --> 10:15.072
go.

10:16.198 --> 10:19.118
Do what you do best
and be a total badass.

10:21.162 --> 10:22.913
And we can meet up at the Academy.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.792
I'll be back by lunch.

10:43.017 --> 10:46.354
-Order! There will be order.
- Yes.

10:46.437 --> 10:47.688
Order?

10:47.772 --> 10:50.024
We are the lords of disorder.

10:50.733 --> 10:53.444
You demanded an audience with the Queen.

10:53.527 --> 10:54.987
Now you must let her speak.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.407
Outline her reformation.

11:00.409 --> 11:01.661
For starters,

11:02.453 --> 11:04.955
I want a grand accounting
of all the souls in Hell.

11:06.582 --> 11:11.837
Until then, I want a freeze
on any more deal-making with mortals.

11:11.921 --> 11:15.216
What about pre-existing contracts?

11:15.299 --> 11:17.051
We must collect on them.

11:17.134 --> 11:19.345
Only after I review each contract

11:19.428 --> 11:21.597
and make a decision
on a case-by-case basis.

11:21.681 --> 11:25.643
Respectfully, does she have the time,

11:25.726 --> 11:27.728
what with all her cheerleading and such?

11:29.980 --> 11:33.442
Silence! Silence!

11:35.403 --> 11:37.697
If you'll let the Queen finish.

11:37.780 --> 11:38.823
We've heard enough.

11:41.951 --> 11:45.538
I, Caliban, demon prince of Hell,

11:45.621 --> 11:47.873
challenge the Morningstar
to her seat on the throne.

11:52.253 --> 11:53.629
Look upon this scroll.

11:54.755 --> 11:59.802
I have gathered 666 signatures
of the highest born of Hell

11:59.885 --> 12:01.512
to endorse my challenge.

12:02.346 --> 12:06.767
By infernal law of the court of Hell,
it must be accepted.

12:06.851 --> 12:08.477
-What?
-Is that true?

12:08.561 --> 12:10.104
Technically, yes.

12:10.771 --> 12:12.523
Or you can simply forfeit the throne.

12:12.940 --> 12:14.442
Oh, don't even.

12:14.525 --> 12:17.820
Then I challenge you on a quest for...

12:19.071 --> 12:20.990
the Unholy Regalia.

12:26.537 --> 12:29.957
The regalia are the three most powerful
occult objects in history.

12:30.791 --> 12:34.879
Relics that have been lost to the ages,
mind you.

12:34.962 --> 12:38.591
Legend has it, he who finds
and collects the relics

12:38.674 --> 12:42.970
may take his seat on the throne,
whether they be Morningstar or not.

12:43.596 --> 12:47.475
Do you accept my challenge, Sabrina?

12:47.558 --> 12:49.351
Yes. Accept it.

12:50.519 --> 12:51.771
I accept.

12:56.025 --> 12:59.195
Then begin with Herod's crown.

12:59.278 --> 13:03.908
All hail King Herod,
who slaughtered innocent babes.

13:05.326 --> 13:06.410
Yes.

13:07.995 --> 13:10.039
Find his crown,

13:10.664 --> 13:15.085
return it to its rightful place
in Pandemonium,

13:15.669 --> 13:19.799
and you will be one step closer
to the throne.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.265
<i>What if it's rigged?</i>

13:29.266 --> 13:30.476
The contest.

13:32.603 --> 13:35.314
What if Caliban and the kings
already know where the regalia is,

13:35.397 --> 13:36.941
and this is just a setup?

13:37.024 --> 13:38.234
It's true.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.569
I put nothing past them,

13:41.695 --> 13:44.114
but no one knows where the items are.

13:44.532 --> 13:47.618
Not even the Dark Lord.
Else he would have destroyed them.

13:47.701 --> 13:52.706
So, if I find Herod's crown,
will that put to bed Caliban's challenge?

13:52.790 --> 13:55.042
There's a trinity of objects, so...

13:56.460 --> 13:58.838
probably end up being
the best two out of three.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.716
Nothing's ever easy.

14:06.929 --> 14:08.806
No, it is not.

14:16.856 --> 14:20.776
There's a leadership opportunity
I wish to discuss with you, Prudence.

14:22.528 --> 14:25.447
I'd like to designate you
Prefect of Students.

14:26.448 --> 14:28.367
Oh, uh... what would my duties be?

14:28.450 --> 14:29.660
Administrative.

14:29.743 --> 14:32.329
Helping me, teaching,
of course, in addition--

14:32.413 --> 14:34.665
High Priestess. It's awful.

14:34.748 --> 14:35.958
You must come at once.

14:42.006 --> 14:43.757
What in Lilith's name?

14:45.342 --> 14:47.052
More of the Dark Lord's handiwork?

14:47.136 --> 14:48.637
No, it's Gerald.

14:49.179 --> 14:50.848
Just Gerald. He tried to fly, but...

14:52.933 --> 14:54.852
He's never fallen like this before.

14:55.603 --> 14:56.979
Stupid boy.

14:58.230 --> 15:00.357
As if we weren't already short
on warlocks.

15:02.943 --> 15:04.111
Elspeth?

15:04.695 --> 15:07.072
Elspeth, have you caught a cold?

15:07.156 --> 15:08.449
Get thee to a warm bed.

15:08.949 --> 15:10.451
And tell your classmates:

15:10.534 --> 15:13.621
Henceforth,
there is to be no unsupervised flying.

15:14.705 --> 15:16.957
Not till we understand
what's happening to us.

15:22.463 --> 15:24.340
<i>The coven is in crisis.</i>

15:25.466 --> 15:28.802
A warlock dead, coven members
stricken with fevers and weakness.

15:28.886 --> 15:31.805
-Zelda, are you sure you're okay?

15:31.889 --> 15:33.015
I'm fine, Hilda.

15:33.098 --> 15:36.101
Except for the fact that we're clearly
under some kind of mystical attack.

15:36.185 --> 15:37.311
A curse?

15:37.394 --> 15:38.520
From another coven?

15:38.604 --> 15:40.564
Look, the Council, when they were here,

15:40.648 --> 15:44.026
they talked of experiencing
a loss of potency.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.738
For now, until we know more,
it is business as usual.

15:47.821 --> 15:49.907
Hilda, tend to the sick.

15:49.990 --> 15:52.409
Distract them,
so they do not ask too many questions.

15:55.746 --> 15:57.581
These are trying times, witches,

15:59.541 --> 16:01.001
but we must stand together.

16:01.710 --> 16:03.045
And we will prevail.

16:12.012 --> 16:15.182
Mrs. Meeks,
I have those attendance reports for you.

16:15.808 --> 16:19.353
Ms. Wardwell, are you going
to opening night of the carnival?

16:19.853 --> 16:22.523
Everyone in town is buzzing about it.

16:23.440 --> 16:24.817
A carnival?

16:27.277 --> 16:29.738
Adam and I used to go
to carnivals together.

16:33.117 --> 16:33.993
<i>Hey, Harvey.</i>

16:34.076 --> 16:35.077
Hm?

16:35.869 --> 16:38.122
You and Roz are going
to that carnival, right?

16:38.664 --> 16:39.540
Yeah.

16:39.790 --> 16:42.418
Apparently, with Sabrina and Nick.

16:43.502 --> 16:45.212
You can totally come with us too.

16:50.509 --> 16:53.470
I was actually thinking about asking
that new guy Robin to go with me.

16:56.306 --> 16:57.599
That's awesome.

16:58.767 --> 17:00.394
His hair is so cool.

17:00.477 --> 17:01.979
-You totally should.

17:04.648 --> 17:05.899
The only thing is...

17:07.651 --> 17:09.737
I've never asked anyone out before.

17:10.404 --> 17:11.363
Gotcha.

17:13.198 --> 17:14.158
What if...

17:15.200 --> 17:16.994
you asked him to go with all of us?

17:17.953 --> 17:18.996
As a group thing?

17:20.497 --> 17:24.418
But then we can all peel off
and leave you two alone.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.629
Yeah, that sounds slightly less scary.

17:28.797 --> 17:30.007
To tell you the truth,

17:31.383 --> 17:35.429
I'm feeling a little nervous
with Roz these days too.

17:36.889 --> 17:40.225
I think she wants us to take it
to the next level.

17:40.809 --> 17:44.563
But I... I've never been to the next level
and I just, you know,

17:44.646 --> 17:48.150
wanna be ready for when it happens,
if it happens...

17:49.151 --> 17:51.111
...but, like,
do I bring it up to her or...

17:51.737 --> 17:52.738
Hey, guys.

17:53.697 --> 17:54.865
Sorry I'm late.

17:56.950 --> 17:57.868
What?

17:58.410 --> 17:59.453
What did I miss?

18:02.873 --> 18:05.084
So my little cousin is Queen of Hell?

18:05.167 --> 18:07.503
Shh! Not so loud, Ambrose.

18:08.670 --> 18:10.214
Not so loud. Okay.

18:11.423 --> 18:13.008
I'm assuming, because you're still alive,

18:13.092 --> 18:14.927
-that the aunties do not know?
-No.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.387
Where is Lilith in all of this?

18:17.471 --> 18:19.973
Lilith is my regent.
She's handling most the workload,

18:20.057 --> 18:22.726
but this prince of Hell
challenged my queenship,

18:22.810 --> 18:25.938
and now I have to find
King Herod's crown before he does,

18:26.021 --> 18:28.190
and I am praying you can help me.

18:29.024 --> 18:34.154
Wait a sec. You're on an Arthurian quest
for the Unholy Regalia?

18:34.238 --> 18:35.781
Starting with Herod's crown.

18:36.615 --> 18:37.616
Will you help me?

18:38.826 --> 18:40.911
How can I say no to a queen?

18:41.787 --> 18:43.705
My sentiments exactly.

18:43.789 --> 18:46.125
Nick, I was just gonna come find you.

18:46.208 --> 18:48.335
That's okay. I found you instead.

18:50.045 --> 18:52.756
Do you have plans for lunch?
'Cause I know a place.

19:04.726 --> 19:09.982
I can't tell you how much it fortifies me,
after this morning's wretched incident,

19:10.065 --> 19:13.360
to see you so enthralled
by your Satanic scriptures.

19:13.443 --> 19:17.531
Oh, we're not reading scriptures,
Directrix Spellman.

19:17.614 --> 19:19.533
What are you reading, if not your studies?

19:22.411 --> 19:23.453
What's this?

19:24.913 --> 19:27.875
-What's happening?
-It's <i>Buxom and the Beast.</i>

19:28.625 --> 19:30.669
It's a witchy romance novel.

19:30.752 --> 19:32.171
Everyone's obsessed.

19:34.381 --> 19:38.010
"Bodice ripper,
in the most delicious of ways.

19:38.093 --> 19:42.347
This tale of a humble witch
and her incubus lover...

19:43.724 --> 19:49.021
being terrorized by the witch's
loveless spinster hag of a...

19:50.939 --> 19:51.899
sister."

19:54.234 --> 19:56.403
By Helga Stillwell.

20:04.995 --> 20:08.457
"And as she stood
before her incubus lover,

20:08.624 --> 20:13.420
his member throbbing
beneath his sweat-drenched jodhpurs,

20:14.379 --> 20:17.049
she felt the firm leather riding crop
in her hand

20:17.758 --> 20:21.303
and was reminded of what it was
to love and be loved."

20:21.386 --> 20:22.804
Hilda Spellman!

20:22.888 --> 20:26.391
Or should I say, Helga Stillwell?

20:26.934 --> 20:28.352
Care to explain this trash?

20:28.435 --> 20:29.728
Hey, don't call it that.

20:30.354 --> 20:32.356
Look, you asked me
to keep the children distracted.

20:32.439 --> 20:37.736
I did, but not with some poorly written,
luridly plotted roman-à-clef.

20:37.819 --> 20:39.238
Have you no shame?

20:39.321 --> 20:40.739
Well, clearly not.

20:40.822 --> 20:41.865
And how did you get this

20:41.949 --> 20:43.575
worth-less-than-a-penny
dreadful published?

20:43.992 --> 20:44.993
Dr. Cee helped me.

20:45.077 --> 20:46.161
-Oh, did he?
-Mm-hmm.

20:46.245 --> 20:49.289
And did he also tell you to paint me,
your very own sister,

20:49.373 --> 20:51.625
as some desiccated villain?

20:52.042 --> 20:54.002
Write what you know,
isn't that what they say?

20:55.545 --> 20:56.380
What?

20:59.549 --> 21:00.467
-Hilda.
-All right.

21:00.550 --> 21:04.012
Now is not the time to reinvent yourself
as a pulp novelist.

21:04.930 --> 21:07.432
We are in a moment of grave crisis.

21:07.516 --> 21:10.477
Your responsibility is to the Academy,
and only the Academy.

21:10.560 --> 21:11.812
No, it's not!

21:12.688 --> 21:14.982
It's not. I care, of course I care.

21:15.065 --> 21:18.819
I'll do what I can
to help protect these little lambs.

21:18.902 --> 21:22.489
But the Academy,
it's your calling, it's not mine.

21:22.572 --> 21:25.242
You wanted to be Directrix.
You wanted to be High Priestess, not me.

21:25.325 --> 21:27.286
You are a Spellman. You have a duty--

21:27.369 --> 21:29.871
I have a duty to myself to be happy.

21:31.999 --> 21:33.208
We'll talk about this tonight.

21:33.292 --> 21:37.170
No, we won't, because I'm going
to the carnival tonight with Dr. Cee.

21:37.754 --> 21:40.215
So, you cook your own dinner.

21:41.758 --> 21:42.801
Fine.

21:43.468 --> 21:45.762
Well, you can forget
about your fledgling career

21:45.846 --> 21:47.806
as a purveyor of lurid fiction.

21:49.391 --> 21:51.351
-There.

21:53.603 --> 21:54.813
Much better.

22:08.243 --> 22:09.161
Hey, Robin.

22:10.662 --> 22:13.373
Oh, hey, Theo. What's up?

22:15.292 --> 22:16.418
Have you seen these fliers?

22:17.461 --> 22:21.173
I guess there's, like, a carnival in town
and opening night's tonight.

22:21.757 --> 22:22.674
Cool.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.136
Wanna go?

22:28.722 --> 22:32.976
With me and my friends,
it'd be like a group thing.

22:34.561 --> 22:36.146
Yeah. Sure.

22:36.229 --> 22:37.147
Really?

22:37.731 --> 22:38.690
Awesome.

22:39.483 --> 22:41.068
Cool.

22:42.361 --> 22:43.236
Cool.

22:52.204 --> 22:53.747
Oh, my gosh.

22:56.917 --> 22:58.418
- Hey.
- What?

23:00.128 --> 23:01.671
-Roz, hey.
-Well, I was...

23:01.755 --> 23:02.839
Harvey.

23:02.923 --> 23:04.341
Harvey. Hey.

23:05.467 --> 23:07.761
We were just talking about the carnival.

23:07.844 --> 23:10.764
You are not gonna believe
what Billy's phobia is.

23:14.267 --> 23:15.102
Clowns?

23:17.854 --> 23:18.688
What?

23:19.189 --> 23:21.108
They're friggin' terrifying.

23:21.191 --> 23:22.692
You're still taking me, Billy.

23:23.318 --> 23:26.196
Roz, wanna come with?
There's room in Billy's car for one more.

23:27.364 --> 23:30.283
Oh, I'm good. I-- I have a ride.

23:30.367 --> 23:33.954
I'm going with friends,
but I will see you guys there,

23:34.037 --> 23:35.205
clowns, or no clowns.

23:35.288 --> 23:38.542
If one comes near me,
I'll knock him on his ass.

23:48.218 --> 23:49.052
What?

23:50.971 --> 23:52.097
Going with friends?

23:52.556 --> 23:54.516
Roz, I thought we were more than that.

23:55.976 --> 23:57.352
Of course we are.

23:58.437 --> 24:01.898
I only said we were going with friends
because we are, aren't we?

24:03.358 --> 24:04.401
Yeah, we are, but...

24:05.277 --> 24:06.528
So we're good?

24:08.447 --> 24:09.656
Yeah, we're good.

24:09.739 --> 24:10.699
Okay.

24:20.417 --> 24:22.335
How'd your reformation go over?

24:22.419 --> 24:25.630
You know, shockingly,
the Kings of Hell didn't embrace my ideas

24:25.714 --> 24:27.757
with the gusto I was hoping for.

24:28.425 --> 24:29.468
No kidding.

24:29.551 --> 24:32.053
You think they'd be excited
to have a 16-year-old witch

24:32.137 --> 24:34.389
tell them how to do their business,
but no.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.057
Not so much.

24:36.141 --> 24:37.434
Mind if we join you?

24:38.477 --> 24:39.311
Actually...

24:42.939 --> 24:45.358
So, Nick, how's your foot doing?

24:47.068 --> 24:49.654
It's fine, Agatha. Why do you ask?

24:50.363 --> 24:53.867
Word on the street is
you've got a thick, fleshy clubfoot now.

24:53.950 --> 24:55.911
-Well, that's only temporary.
-No, but really,

24:55.994 --> 24:58.538
what's it like having been
with both Sabrina and her daddy?

24:58.622 --> 25:02.083
Yeah, Nicky, we heard
the Dark Lord made you his bitch.

25:02.167 --> 25:04.085
-Shut up, you half-wit.
-I'm warning you two.

25:04.169 --> 25:06.254
All this time,
you're pretending to crush on Sabrina

25:06.338 --> 25:09.674
when really it's her dad
you had the hots for, huh?

25:10.509 --> 25:12.802
You so don't wanna be pushing me
right now, Agatha.

25:12.886 --> 25:14.346
Or what, Nicky?

25:14.930 --> 25:18.058
Will you wrestle us into submission
the way the Dark Lord wrestled you?

25:18.141 --> 25:19.684
Okay, that's enough.

25:20.310 --> 25:21.269
You know what?

25:26.191 --> 25:27.943
You two skanks can go to heaven.

25:32.364 --> 25:36.952
You are so lucky the Church of Night
only has, like, 12 members right now.

25:37.035 --> 25:39.746
Otherwise,
I would totally smite your asses.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.461
-Sabrina?
-Ambrose, I gotta find Nick.

25:46.545 --> 25:49.839
I believe I may have found Herod's crown.
Or at least generally.

25:50.882 --> 25:52.634
Time is of the essence, is it not?

25:56.263 --> 25:57.639
How'd you find it?

25:57.722 --> 26:00.141
Good old-fashioned research
into its provenance.

26:00.225 --> 26:03.562
I started with its last known whereabouts,
namely the tomb of Herod.

26:03.645 --> 26:05.605
Officially, Herodiam, as it is called,

26:05.689 --> 26:09.359
was first excavated
by Italian archaeologists in 1962.

26:09.442 --> 26:10.819
And unofficially?

26:10.902 --> 26:15.323
By an American archaeologist
and warlock, Edward Robinson, in 1838.

26:15.824 --> 26:19.411
From there, the crown changed hands
several times from one Jakey Huisman

26:19.494 --> 26:20.829
to Aleister Crowley

26:20.912 --> 26:24.040
to, well, an American soldier,
Private Benjamin Blossom,

26:24.124 --> 26:27.627
who recovered the crown
from Hitler's bunker in 1945.

26:27.711 --> 26:30.213
Now from there, Blossom,
and here's the kicker,

26:30.297 --> 26:33.216
sneaked the crown back
to his home town of...

26:33.300 --> 26:34.968
If you say Greendale, I'll lose my mind.

26:35.051 --> 26:36.511
Close, but no.

26:36.595 --> 26:39.639
-Riverdale, where he was murdered.
-Of course.

26:39.723 --> 26:41.641
By a group of occultists
who were after the crown,

26:41.725 --> 26:44.603
-but they never found it.
-Well, how are we gonna find the crown?

26:44.686 --> 26:46.021
Riverdale's a big, scary place.

26:46.104 --> 26:47.022
True...

26:49.357 --> 26:51.318
but we have this.

26:54.654 --> 26:55.655
A compass?

26:56.489 --> 26:57.782
An immoral compass.

26:57.866 --> 27:00.118
Now this one belonged
to <i>the</i> Flying Dutchman,

27:00.201 --> 27:02.287
or was it the Ancient Mariner?

27:02.370 --> 27:05.582
I don't remember, but yours truly
has recalibrated this one

27:05.665 --> 27:09.502
to be highly sensitive
to energies from occult items.

27:10.545 --> 27:12.422
For instance, your <i>Book of the Beast.</i>

27:19.512 --> 27:21.514
Ambrose, you're a genius.

27:21.598 --> 27:22.766
Once we reach Riverdale,

27:22.849 --> 27:25.185
we follow the compass
to wherever it leads us.

27:53.004 --> 27:54.464
I don't understand.

27:55.465 --> 27:58.426
They didn't hide it in the ground.
They hid it in the tree.

27:59.469 --> 28:00.804
Clever Blossoms.

28:10.230 --> 28:11.398
Another, Gray.

28:14.651 --> 28:16.444
Perhaps you should stop
while you're ahead?

28:16.528 --> 28:18.655
You're looking a tad...
what's the word?

28:19.197 --> 28:20.865
Busted, dear Nick.

28:21.783 --> 28:25.161
So are you.
You're breaking out like a teenager.

28:28.248 --> 28:29.833
You needn't torture yourself.

28:30.250 --> 28:33.128
I've known plenty of heathens
who've had the Dark Lord inside them.

28:33.962 --> 28:37.257
They were somewhat battered, yes.

28:38.007 --> 28:39.467
But in the end, they recover.

28:40.218 --> 28:44.514
I mean, a few even say they reached
a new almost transcendent level of pain.

28:45.181 --> 28:46.433
Where it became pleasure.

28:49.269 --> 28:50.103
You know...

28:52.063 --> 28:53.481
this place used to be fun.

28:55.150 --> 28:56.901
Shall I summon a playmate for you?

28:57.610 --> 28:58.528
Or two?

29:02.449 --> 29:05.076
Tempting, but no.

29:08.079 --> 29:09.205
You'll be back.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.125
They always come back.

29:18.548 --> 29:19.591
Look alive.

29:32.937 --> 29:34.397
The crown of Herod.

29:38.109 --> 29:39.611
Will wonders never cease?

29:40.945 --> 29:42.322
Give it to me. The ax?

29:42.405 --> 29:43.990
Wait, what are you going to do?

29:44.073 --> 29:46.242
Destroy it
so no one can use it against me,

29:46.326 --> 29:49.037
-then return what's left of it to Hell.
-Wait now. Hold on, cousin.

29:49.120 --> 29:51.831
This crown is radiating
an enormous amount of energy.

29:51.915 --> 29:54.250
The compass could sense it. I can feel it.

29:54.709 --> 29:58.755
If I could borrow it for a few hours
to study its properties,

29:59.464 --> 30:01.424
I might be able to harness its power,

30:02.175 --> 30:03.760
restore our coven's strength.

30:05.428 --> 30:06.805
I don't know, Ambrose.

30:06.888 --> 30:08.807
Go to the carnival with your friends,

30:09.933 --> 30:11.684
that should give me enough time.

30:12.143 --> 30:14.103
Then you may do with it as ye see fit.

30:15.772 --> 30:18.233
Fine, fine.
But then we destroy it together.

30:18.691 --> 30:19.609
Promise?

30:57.772 --> 30:58.815
Melvin?

31:01.901 --> 31:03.319
Have you seen Nick anywhere?

31:03.862 --> 31:06.614
I've been looking all over for him.
Elspeth said to try the library.

31:06.698 --> 31:10.034
Yeah, he was in here
researching something.

31:10.118 --> 31:11.703
He'd been at Dorian's.

31:12.287 --> 31:14.622
And then he asked
if the Desecrated Church was empty.

31:24.215 --> 31:25.758
Auto amputation?

31:26.301 --> 31:27.385
What the heaven?

31:32.765 --> 31:33.725
Oh, no.

31:35.643 --> 31:39.063
Nick, Nick! Stop. What are you doing?

31:39.147 --> 31:40.481
It won't cut through.

31:40.565 --> 31:42.734
It won't even draw blood.
I can't get rid of this thing.

31:42.817 --> 31:45.486
-Nick, what?

31:45.570 --> 31:50.658
It is going to take some time,
but it will change back. Okay?

31:50.742 --> 31:52.577
Aunt Hilda said so.

31:52.660 --> 31:54.120
Ambrose said so.

31:54.203 --> 31:56.205
But please, don't hurt yourself.

31:56.289 --> 31:57.999
He's still inside me, Sabrina.

31:59.792 --> 32:03.463
I can feel his residue inside of me.

32:03.546 --> 32:05.965
No, no, no. He's not.

32:06.049 --> 32:08.968
It's after effects, like PTSD.

32:19.604 --> 32:21.856
I don't feel like myself anymore, Sabrina.

32:23.316 --> 32:24.275
Nick.

32:25.443 --> 32:27.362
Nick, what can I do?

32:27.445 --> 32:28.363
Nothing.

32:30.239 --> 32:31.574
I'm sorry, Sabrina.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.455
Do you understand, it was such a total...

32:37.538 --> 32:39.958
I can only imagine.

32:43.586 --> 32:46.506
So, let's start filling your head
with good things.

32:47.256 --> 32:48.257
Okay?

32:51.761 --> 32:55.598
Like, are you still up
for the carnival tonight?

33:12.031 --> 33:13.825
The crown of Herod.

33:14.993 --> 33:17.453
Could the crown be tapped
as a source of power,

33:17.537 --> 33:20.456
of energy for the witches of Greendale?

33:40.184 --> 33:41.352
We're saved.

33:49.736 --> 33:53.906
The crown appears to be
charging my wand with its energies.

33:55.491 --> 33:57.285
What makes you so powerful?

33:59.037 --> 34:01.581
Is it magnetism? Is it hexcraft?

34:02.457 --> 34:06.669
Is it the blood magic
of 1,000 babes slaughtered?

34:09.756 --> 34:13.217
Why... do I smell maple syrup?

34:21.768 --> 34:23.895
I went to sleep with my crown,

34:23.978 --> 34:29.609
but someone disturbed my slumber
and took my beloved.

34:30.985 --> 34:33.780
Was it you?

34:34.447 --> 34:35.907
I would never...

34:36.824 --> 34:39.035
<i>Le-heh Lishon Achshav.</i>

34:47.877 --> 34:51.047
My beloved,

34:51.923 --> 34:54.008
tell me...

34:54.467 --> 34:57.595
who awoke us?

34:57.678 --> 34:59.722
<i>Sabrina.</i>

34:59.806 --> 35:03.935
<i>The girl who would be Queen.</i>

35:17.782 --> 35:21.452
Sabrina.

35:25.998 --> 35:31.546
Welcome to Professor Carcosa's
traveling carnival and phantasmagoria.

35:31.629 --> 35:32.713
-Thank you.
-Corn dog.

35:32.797 --> 35:34.924
Step right up.

35:35.925 --> 35:37.468
To quote a friend,

35:38.719 --> 35:40.763
"We show you things that you don't know,

35:41.430 --> 35:44.142
we tell you of places you'll never go.

35:44.225 --> 35:47.937
From mountains
where maddened winds did blow...

35:48.020 --> 35:50.731
the islands where zephyrs breathed

35:51.482 --> 35:52.817
sweet and low.

35:53.234 --> 35:56.529
We've risen to Heaven, plunged below...

36:00.158 --> 36:03.327
...for we wanted
to make it one hell of a show."

36:07.081 --> 36:08.082
You okay?

36:08.457 --> 36:09.292
Yeah.

36:09.834 --> 36:13.004
Yeah, I just thought
I saw something for a second.

36:13.713 --> 36:15.631
Oh, there they are. Sabrina.

36:17.258 --> 36:19.302
-Something bad?
- Hey, guys.

36:20.303 --> 36:21.345
Sorry, we're late.

36:21.637 --> 36:22.889
You're right on time.

36:22.972 --> 36:25.183
Harvey's about to inhale
his third funnel cake.

36:25.266 --> 36:28.060
You must be Robin.
I'm Sabrina. This is my boyfriend, Nick.

36:28.144 --> 36:29.020
Hey.

36:29.103 --> 36:31.189
It's nice to meet you.

36:31.272 --> 36:33.274
Hey, Scratch. How's it going?

36:34.275 --> 36:35.401
Fine, Kinkle.

36:36.027 --> 36:37.278
How's it going with you?

36:38.362 --> 36:40.198
Dude, relax, it was just a question.

36:41.282 --> 36:43.034
-I am relaxed.
-Okay.

36:43.618 --> 36:45.661
-Shall we go in?
-Great idea.

36:45.745 --> 36:47.622
Let's see what rides they have.

36:47.705 --> 36:48.789
Rides!

36:48.873 --> 36:50.499
Oh my, yes.

36:50.583 --> 36:51.918
A gamut of them.

36:52.710 --> 36:57.089
Bumper cars, a tilt-a-whirl,
a haunted house.

36:58.174 --> 36:59.217
Okay.

36:59.675 --> 37:01.052
-Cool, good.
-Great.

37:02.887 --> 37:04.931
- That was weird.
- I know.

37:21.447 --> 37:23.449
I didn't expect her
to actually like

37:23.532 --> 37:24.659
what I'd written in my book.

37:24.742 --> 37:26.410
She'll get over it, Hilda. It's--

37:26.494 --> 37:28.704
Well, I don't know that she will, Dr. Cee.
Or read it.

37:28.788 --> 37:32.041
I mean, she has never yet accepted
that we're just different witches,

37:32.124 --> 37:35.002
and we just want different things
and different lives.

37:35.086 --> 37:41.300
I just want to grow old
in a little cottage with a fire

37:41.384 --> 37:42.843
and my spiders and a dog.

37:42.927 --> 37:44.178
Not a stuffed one.

37:44.679 --> 37:47.223
And I just, I don't know,

37:47.306 --> 37:51.560
I wanna knit and read and watch reruns
of <i>The Munsters</i> on TV.

37:52.270 --> 37:53.646
I want that too, Hilda.

37:54.814 --> 37:56.691
I've wanted it for a while now.

37:57.733 --> 37:58.859
-Hilda?
<i>-</i>Yeah.

38:00.403 --> 38:02.947
You all right? What are you doing?

38:03.531 --> 38:04.615
No.

38:05.491 --> 38:06.450
Dr. Cee.

38:06.534 --> 38:08.619
I've been waiting
for the right moment to ask.

38:12.832 --> 38:15.459
Hildegarde Antoinette Spellman,

38:16.919 --> 38:18.129
will you marry me?

38:22.216 --> 38:23.843
Yeah.

38:23.926 --> 38:25.761
Yeah. Absolutely.

38:34.228 --> 38:36.439
Step right up. Step right up.

38:36.522 --> 38:37.648
Test your virility.

38:38.232 --> 38:39.608
You, sir, perhaps you?

38:39.692 --> 38:40.860
Are you a He-Man,

38:41.277 --> 38:43.279
or a 98-pound weakling?

38:47.908 --> 38:50.244
-Yeah, I'll give it a try.
-That's a brave fellow.

38:50.328 --> 38:51.454
Prove your mettle.

38:53.873 --> 38:55.624
It's just like a pickax in the mines.

38:55.708 --> 38:56.792
You got this, babe.

39:14.435 --> 39:15.770
Tough luck, young buck.

39:15.853 --> 39:17.521
Don't be displeased.

39:17.605 --> 39:19.940
It's not every man who bests Hercules.

39:20.024 --> 39:20.983
Who's next?

39:21.067 --> 39:22.234
I'll take a shot.

39:24.111 --> 39:27.948
All right, Kinkle? Step aside.
See how a real man does it.

39:34.997 --> 39:36.999
-Hey.
-Billy, that was amazing.

39:37.083 --> 39:38.459
Can I pick which prize you get?

39:40.878 --> 39:41.879
Whichever one you want.

39:44.048 --> 39:46.801
Yeah, better at that than you,
that's what I'm saying.

39:46.884 --> 39:47.802
Yeah.

40:07.947 --> 40:09.448
Would you like a palm reading?

40:11.158 --> 40:12.076
Please.

40:14.203 --> 40:15.121
Sit.

40:30.511 --> 40:31.720
Curious.

40:32.763 --> 40:38.644
This is your lifeline.
It shows me you have a question.

40:40.938 --> 40:42.898
Um... I...

40:45.109 --> 40:47.903
I had a fiancé...

40:48.696 --> 40:49.655
Adam.

40:52.408 --> 40:55.119
I fear something terrible
has befallen him.

40:57.288 --> 40:58.789
I'm so sorry.

40:59.707 --> 41:01.125
He is gone forever.

41:04.462 --> 41:05.963
But you already know this.

41:07.465 --> 41:09.258
Because you were there.

41:09.758 --> 41:10.759
I...

41:12.219 --> 41:13.262
I wasn't.

41:15.598 --> 41:17.892
At least, I don't remember.

41:20.102 --> 41:20.978
Wait.

41:22.980 --> 41:24.023
Tell me.

41:24.815 --> 41:29.403
You did not consummate your relationship
with Adam?

41:29.487 --> 41:30.905
What?

41:31.572 --> 41:34.158
How dare you?

41:36.452 --> 41:38.913
No. No, you did not.

41:40.623 --> 41:41.707
Good day...

41:43.959 --> 41:45.044
Madame.

42:12.947 --> 42:14.156
It's cold up here.

42:24.375 --> 42:25.459
Is that better?

42:30.965 --> 42:31.840
Wait.

42:32.758 --> 42:34.677
There's something
you should know about me.

42:36.095 --> 42:36.971
I...

42:37.555 --> 42:40.808
I didn't always look like me. I was...

42:43.269 --> 42:44.728
I used to be different.

42:47.606 --> 42:49.358
I wasn't born Theo...

42:53.571 --> 42:55.030
It's okay.

42:57.199 --> 42:58.784
I mean, you're Theo now.

43:00.411 --> 43:01.412
And, um...

43:02.663 --> 43:04.373
in case it wasn't obvious,

43:06.792 --> 43:08.294
I really like you, Theo.

43:12.881 --> 43:14.508
I like you too, Robin.

44:56.402 --> 44:57.361
There you are.

44:59.697 --> 45:00.531
Are you okay?

45:04.535 --> 45:05.786
Why'd you leave?

45:06.704 --> 45:09.665
I'm fine, but let's get outta here.

45:35.983 --> 45:38.777
I know you're probably not
in the carnival mood,

45:39.945 --> 45:41.155
but thanks for rallying.

45:50.080 --> 45:54.042
Hey, your dad must be pretty happy, huh?
In the end, he got what he wanted.

45:55.461 --> 45:57.504
You on the throne, his daughter.

45:58.505 --> 46:02.342
-Ruling Hell.
-I did that for you, Nick, not for him.

46:03.761 --> 46:06.096
Yeah, still,
a part of you must like it, right?

46:06.638 --> 46:07.473
Nick.

46:11.185 --> 46:13.145
We haven't talked about it yet, but...

46:14.563 --> 46:15.939
what was it like for you?

46:17.065 --> 46:18.609
Inside the flesh Acheron?

46:19.610 --> 46:21.403
Uh, Sabrina, I...

46:22.529 --> 46:25.032
Right now, I don't wanna think about that.

46:26.200 --> 46:27.075
I just...

46:28.869 --> 46:32.790
want to ride the tunnel of love
with my girlfriend.

46:34.333 --> 46:35.459
Is that cool?

46:36.251 --> 46:37.252
Sure.

46:37.336 --> 46:38.295
Yeah.

46:38.462 --> 46:39.421
Yes.

46:50.849 --> 46:51.934
That's 20.

47:25.801 --> 47:27.177
- Nick!
-Sabrina, run!

47:27.261 --> 47:30.347
You stole my crown.

47:30.430 --> 47:32.975
Disturbed my sleep.

47:36.061 --> 47:37.521
-Go!
-What's happening?

47:37.604 --> 47:39.523
It's part of the show, but just go.

47:40.065 --> 47:41.233
<i>Angustos in via!</i>

47:47.948 --> 47:50.075
<i>Ad quos eieci te ad infernum daemonium--</i>

48:03.589 --> 48:04.715
Caliban.

48:04.798 --> 48:05.757
Help me.

48:05.841 --> 48:07.593
Beautiful as you are, I am tempted.

48:08.635 --> 48:09.595
No.

48:09.678 --> 48:10.721
I think not.

48:12.097 --> 48:13.932
My crown.

48:14.016 --> 48:16.727
My beloved.

48:20.147 --> 48:21.023
Nick!

48:21.523 --> 48:24.860
You awoke me and started this misery.

48:26.403 --> 48:31.491
You will weep at the rending of your skin
when I flay you alive.

48:31.575 --> 48:35.287
Then I will slaughter all of the innocents
of this place,

48:35.370 --> 48:38.081
as I did centuries ago in Judea.

48:38.665 --> 48:43.587
I will start with your flesh.

48:44.671 --> 48:46.882
<i>Explodere Centena Millia!</i>

48:59.519 --> 49:02.773
I followed his bloody footprints.

49:03.273 --> 49:04.191
And...

49:07.194 --> 49:08.278
We need to go.

49:09.237 --> 49:10.113
Now.

49:10.864 --> 49:14.576
I'm weak, but I could probably
clean up this mess

49:14.660 --> 49:16.536
before teleporting myself home.

49:26.588 --> 49:27.798
I have a question.

49:28.882 --> 49:31.885
Who was the guy that looks like Thor
and stole Herod's crown?

49:32.260 --> 49:33.136
Uh...

49:33.220 --> 49:36.682
...that's Caliban.
He's literally the worst.

49:36.765 --> 49:40.435
He's a prince of Hell,
and he's made of clay, which is weird.

49:40.519 --> 49:41.561
Uh-huh.

49:41.645 --> 49:43.897
But we don't have to
talk about that right now.

49:43.981 --> 49:45.983
Let's just go home. Get cleaned up.

49:48.610 --> 49:53.031
Actually, I, um...
I wanna go back to the Academy.

49:55.033 --> 49:57.703
To my own bed,
till I get things back to normal.

49:58.662 --> 50:00.205
Nick, are you okay?

50:00.622 --> 50:01.456
Yes.

50:02.624 --> 50:03.583
Yes, Spellman.

50:06.294 --> 50:07.295
I'm fine.

50:07.921 --> 50:08.922
Promise.

50:13.301 --> 50:16.513
That's the first time you've called me
Spellman since you came home.

50:22.394 --> 50:23.228
Yeah.

50:42.706 --> 50:43.832
Nicky boy.

50:43.915 --> 50:45.250
Rough night?

50:45.333 --> 50:47.294
I was attacked by King Herod.

50:48.920 --> 50:50.213
She might not see it yet,

50:50.297 --> 50:52.924
but I'm pretty sure
my girlfriend has a new suitor.

50:54.051 --> 50:55.552
Isn't that always the way?

50:56.720 --> 50:59.347
-Let me get you an absinthe.
-The bottle, Gray.

51:00.515 --> 51:02.517
And the playmates you offered me before?

51:03.060 --> 51:04.936
I changed my mind. I want them.

51:06.438 --> 51:07.481
One of each.

51:09.149 --> 51:10.859
As you wish.

51:17.991 --> 51:20.368

52:21.805 --> 52:23.557
What happened to you, Adam?

52:27.310 --> 52:28.687
What happened to me?

52:34.317 --> 52:40.991
Caliban! Caliban!

52:43.952 --> 52:45.078
Yeah!

52:47.956 --> 52:48.999
There you are.

52:51.626 --> 52:53.295
What does my lady think?

52:53.920 --> 52:56.423
It's just temporary
until I win the infernal crown, of course.

53:00.051 --> 53:02.846
We could have died.
Why didn't you help us?

53:02.929 --> 53:03.972
Help you?

53:04.848 --> 53:06.391
This is a competition.

53:07.184 --> 53:08.476
I was watching you.

53:09.019 --> 53:09.895
Closely.

53:09.978 --> 53:11.021
If you were watching me,

53:11.104 --> 53:13.648
did you know King Herod
was coming for his crown?

53:13.732 --> 53:17.986
My lady, everyone knows
King Herod is a guardian.

53:19.279 --> 53:20.780
I assumed you would kill him.

53:21.781 --> 53:22.908
Or he would kill you.

53:23.575 --> 53:24.534
Or perhaps...

53:25.994 --> 53:27.662
you would kill each other.

53:28.455 --> 53:30.498
A true monarch knows strategy.

53:31.041 --> 53:33.043
Now, you didn't answer my question.

53:34.794 --> 53:37.005
The crown suits me, don't you agree?

53:46.223 --> 53:47.641
The first round's yours.

53:48.391 --> 53:49.643
Enjoy it.

53:49.726 --> 53:51.228
It's the last one you'll win.

53:51.811 --> 53:53.063
And I swear,

53:53.897 --> 53:57.192
I'll slice your throat ear-to-ear
before I let you have my throne.

53:57.275 --> 54:01.655
Sabrina.

54:17.504 --> 54:21.466
The Kinkle boy,
you can smell the innocence on him.

54:21.549 --> 54:23.343
The spinster Wardwell too.

54:23.885 --> 54:25.053
She's a virgin.

54:25.136 --> 54:26.596
The Putnam child...

54:29.599 --> 54:31.393
is vestal, as well.

54:33.186 --> 54:34.980
There is a seer who runs with them.

54:36.106 --> 54:38.900
-She could pose a threat to us.
-Leave her to me.

54:41.152 --> 54:42.529
The earth is ready.

54:46.658 --> 54:49.160
This seed is ready.

54:55.125 --> 54:57.210
Bring the blood sacrifice.
