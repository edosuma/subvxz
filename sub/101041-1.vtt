if you would take

31:24.280 --> 31:27.080

31:27.110 --> 31:29.620
And I want you

31:29.650 --> 31:30.880
on one side of the pick.

31:30.920 --> 31:32.490
So if you took a--

31:32.520 --> 31:33.820
you write "2H."

31:33.850 --> 31:34.990
Okay, and I'll show it around,

31:35.020 --> 31:37.120
so that you got

31:37.160 --> 31:38.320
And once that's done,

31:40.730 --> 31:42.030

31:42.060 --> 31:44.230

31:44.260 --> 31:45.630

31:45.670 --> 31:46.630
- I believe I did.

31:46.670 --> 31:47.970

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
I'll try to write it legibly,

31:50.040 --> 31:51.400
- Okay, perfect.

31:51.440 --> 31:54.910
And now,

31:54.940 --> 31:59.150

32:06.020 --> 32:08.550

32:08.590 --> 32:09.860

[light music]

32:22.830 --> 32:23.900

32:23.940 --> 32:25.370
Do you want these on top

32:25.410 --> 32:26.440
It's your choice.

32:26.470 --> 32:27.940
- I want them on top.

32:27.970 --> 32:29.940

32:34.280 --> 32:36.520
Cut the deck.

32:36.550 --> 32:40.590
Now, let's review.

32:40.620 --> 32:43.560
You used a pick to pick a card,

32:43.590 --> 32:45.490
of your card on

32:45.520 --> 32:48.830
Penn, you picked a number

32:48.860 --> 32:50.660
and you wrote your number

32:50.700 --> 32:51.900
- Mm-hmm.

32:51.930 --> 32:53.270
- And you're comfortable

32:53.300 --> 32:54.530
- I am.

32:54.570 --> 32:55.670
- Do you wanna change

32:55.700 --> 32:57.000
- I do not.

32:57.040 --> 32:58.540
Now, I'm gonna count down

32:58.570 --> 33:00.210
I'll do it as quick as I can,

33:00.240 --> 33:03.740
Since you said 47,

33:03.780 --> 33:06.380
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

33:06.410 --> 33:11.280

41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47.

33:28.530 --> 33:31.000
I'm going to place the 47th

33:31.040 --> 33:33.710
Now, Penn, if you had said

33:33.740 --> 33:36.270
we would've landed on one

33:36.310 --> 33:37.680
If you had said

33:37.710 --> 33:40.310
we would've landed on one

33:40.350 --> 33:41.880
And in a moment,

33:41.910 --> 33:43.120
in the center of the theater,

33:43.150 --> 33:44.750
trying to figure out

33:44.780 --> 33:46.990
And there are gonna be three

33:47.020 --> 33:48.890
And I'd like to address them

33:48.920 --> 33:50.960
Yes, Teller, at the very

33:50.990 --> 33:52.390
I offered you the option

33:52.430 --> 33:54.960
one of six different

33:54.990 --> 33:56.930
You happened to choose

33:56.960 --> 33:59.530
but it was a completely

33:59.560 --> 34:01.330
Number two.

34:01.370 --> 34:03.070
this is an ordinary

34:03.100 --> 34:05.570
and you're more than welcome

34:05.600 --> 34:06.810
And number three--

34:06.840 --> 34:08.980
and this is the one

34:09.010 --> 34:10.679
Yes, Penn,

34:10.710 --> 34:12.780
after you wrote your

34:12.810 --> 34:15.650
I even asked if you wanted to

34:15.679 --> 34:18.420
And you could have.

34:18.449 --> 34:19.620
- I said no.

34:19.650 --> 34:21.650
- So for the first time,

34:21.690 --> 34:24.760
that guitar pick and show us

34:24.790 --> 34:28.690
- It's the jack of diamonds.

34:28.730 --> 34:31.300
- Well, there's only one

34:31.330 --> 34:34.630
And that is, if this card

34:34.670 --> 34:39.270
did this trick fool

34:39.300 --> 34:42.340
[cheers and applause]

34:44.040 --> 34:48.010
But Penn, Teller,

34:48.050 --> 34:50.449
you were gonna choose

34:50.480 --> 34:52.920
And I was pretty sure you

34:52.949 --> 34:56.860
And I was positive you

34:56.889 --> 34:58.390
In fact,

34:58.420 --> 35:01.730
I actually made a prediction

35:01.760 --> 35:05.030
Penn, would you take out

35:06.100 --> 35:07.600
And would you roll it

35:07.630 --> 35:09.970
until you could see

35:10.000 --> 35:11.370
Do you see it?

35:11.400 --> 35:12.610
Now, I hope you

35:12.640 --> 35:15.340
'cause it's really small print.

35:15.370 --> 35:20.050
- "You selected a blue pick,

35:20.080 --> 35:23.920
and number 47."

[cheers and applause]

35:27.950 --> 35:30.960
- Paul Gertner!

35:34.890 --> 35:37.400
So where are you

35:37.430 --> 35:38.700
- Uh...

35:38.730 --> 35:40.130
[laughter]

35:40.170 --> 35:42.230
Maybe between the other two,

35:42.270 --> 35:43.300
- [laughs]

35:43.340 --> 35:44.300
- They were watching

35:44.340 --> 35:46.440
- Oh, they're gonna be so mad.

35:46.470 --> 35:48.140
[laughter]

35:48.170 --> 35:49.840
So, when did you come up

35:49.880 --> 35:51.740
- Well, this trick,

35:51.780 --> 35:53.550
And this trick was designed

35:53.580 --> 35:55.110
- Is it harder to fool them

35:55.150 --> 35:57.620
because they know you

35:57.650 --> 35:59.020
- I think that's what

35:59.050 --> 36:00.890
They know a little bit

36:00.920 --> 36:03.490
um, and I know a little bit

36:03.520 --> 36:04.720
So it becomes sort of like

36:04.760 --> 36:07.160
a, uh, jiujitsu match,

36:07.190 --> 36:08.490
- Right.

36:08.530 --> 36:09.730
- And I wanted them to come up

36:09.760 --> 36:11.230
'cause if--if it fools them,

36:11.260 --> 36:12.900
they had the best view

36:12.930 --> 36:14.300
- Yeah.

36:14.330 --> 36:16.640
- Okay, Paul.

36:16.670 --> 36:18.800
Let's see if Penn

36:18.840 --> 36:20.070
- Okay.

36:20.110 --> 36:22.110
- Paul, how you doing?

36:22.140 --> 36:24.110
- Fourth time,

36:24.140 --> 36:26.610
to have us sit right up

36:26.650 --> 36:27.880
- [laughs]

36:27.910 --> 36:29.780
- You know, you have got

36:29.820 --> 36:32.720
you are great, and you

36:32.750 --> 36:34.490
And also today,

36:34.520 --> 36:38.220
you have me kind of going

36:38.260 --> 36:40.590
'cause you brought out

36:40.630 --> 36:42.300
And I don't know

36:42.330 --> 36:43.500
but I'm a bass player.

36:43.530 --> 36:44.930
- Mm-hmm.

36:44.960 --> 36:46.800
- And now I mostly play jazz,

36:46.830 --> 36:49.800
But you may not know this,

36:49.840 --> 36:51.740
early '80s,

36:51.770 --> 36:54.070
I would play my electric bass,

36:54.110 --> 36:55.470
And I would play with a pick,

36:55.510 --> 36:58.010
and I would use so much force,

36:58.040 --> 37:00.050
Not this gentle

37:00.080 --> 37:02.050
but real force on that pick.

37:02.080 --> 37:07.120
It was a rough, rough time,

37:07.150 --> 37:10.190
Bebop, not as rough and tough

37:10.220 --> 37:13.030
But I'll tell you one thing,

37:13.060 --> 37:16.000
And you gave me the pen

37:16.030 --> 37:18.560
A joke about my name.

37:18.600 --> 37:21.400

37:21.430 --> 37:23.970

37:24.000 --> 37:27.770
"Hey, Penn, got a pencil?"

37:27.810 --> 37:32.080
I should have an index

37:32.110 --> 37:35.510

37:35.550 --> 37:37.080
maybe more--more--

37:37.120 --> 37:39.280
It was amazing.

37:39.320 --> 37:42.360
