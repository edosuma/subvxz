<i>"The sweetest honey is</i>
<i>loathsome in his own deliciousness,</i>

01:27.837 --> 01:30.381
<i>and in the taste confounds the appetite.</i>

01:30.465 --> 01:32.759
<i>Therefore, love moderately."</i>

01:33.510 --> 01:36.513
Romeo and Juliet,<i> Act II, Scene 6.</i>

01:38.139 --> 01:39.349
<i>"Love moderately"?</i>

01:39.432 --> 01:43.436
<i>Did Shakespeare really believe</i>
<i>you could control how deeply you fall?</i>

01:43.520 --> 01:45.939
<i>Like your heart is something</i>
<i>you can pour into a measuring cup</i>

01:46.022 --> 01:47.899
<i>and stop at the two-thirds line?</i>

01:55.782 --> 01:56.616
Apollo.

01:58.451 --> 01:59.285
Apollo.

02:01.329 --> 02:04.457
Don't go near the last one.
Someone's having a serious party in there.

02:17.846 --> 02:18.680
Apollo?

02:26.354 --> 02:29.065
-Theo.
-What in the name of Lilith...

02:29.149 --> 02:31.776
What's wrong with him? Theo, wake up!

02:31.860 --> 02:34.112
-He can't hear you.
-Theo.

02:34.195 --> 02:35.697
What happened to him?

02:37.031 --> 02:39.200
I don't know. I don't remember.

02:39.284 --> 02:41.661
What do you mean? What happened to Theo?

02:41.744 --> 02:44.914
I told you, I don't remember.

02:46.541 --> 02:47.375
Shit.

02:49.294 --> 02:51.254
Your parents are looking for you.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.841
Your mom called mine.
She told them I'd been there.

03:02.348 --> 03:03.683
Our hearts drive us.

03:04.475 --> 03:07.103
Duty and logic lead us.

03:08.021 --> 03:08.980
What?

03:11.357 --> 03:14.152
Are you really reciting
the Guild Creed, Apollo?

03:14.235 --> 03:15.445
Yes, Calliope, I am.

03:16.529 --> 03:18.740
Because I don't know what else to do.

03:25.997 --> 03:27.498
Our hearts drive us.

03:29.167 --> 03:31.169
Duty and logic...

03:33.213 --> 03:34.839
Duty and logic...

03:36.299 --> 03:38.426
You guys have gotta get out of here.

03:38.509 --> 03:40.637
Police are still looking for you.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.723
The stay-at-home order makes anyone
on the streets easier to question.

04:38.653 --> 04:41.823
-My brother.
-I know there are no words.

04:41.906 --> 04:43.825
There's nothing I can do.

04:44.659 --> 04:47.161
But my phone will be
in my hands at all times, okay?

04:47.245 --> 04:48.371
-Okay.
-Go.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.331
I'm right behind you.

06:29.847 --> 06:30.848
What are we gonna say?

06:33.851 --> 06:34.769
I'll tell them.

06:36.562 --> 06:40.274
-They should hear the truth from me.
-What is the truth, Apollo?

06:40.358 --> 06:41.567
Theo's gone.

06:42.819 --> 06:43.820
I'm responsible.

06:45.571 --> 06:48.574
-That's the only truth that matters.
-That makes no sense.

06:48.658 --> 06:49.992
If we tell them Theo's gone,

06:50.076 --> 06:53.454
the first thing they'll ask
is what happened and you can't remember.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.458
Look, listen. Okay, hold on.

07:38.541 --> 07:40.418
He was big.

07:40.501 --> 07:41.586
He had muscles

07:41.669 --> 07:44.881
and he grabbed me by the neck,
I'm like, you strong.

07:44.964 --> 07:47.300
-And then he threw me.
-I heard that one before.

07:47.383 --> 07:49.469
Your dad just asked
if he can have your steaks.

07:50.052 --> 07:51.721
That's right, you snooze, you lose.

07:51.804 --> 07:53.848
Yo. Bro. I was just telling Mom and Pops

07:53.931 --> 07:56.184
about how you saved my ass
at the Legacy raid.

07:59.061 --> 08:00.438
-What?
-He claims

08:00.521 --> 08:02.982
you two took out some bodybuilder vamp.

08:04.901 --> 08:07.653
Oh. Yeah, that guy.

08:07.737 --> 08:10.281
That guy was the size of an ox.

08:10.364 --> 08:13.618
Callie, you weren't there,
but I'm talking fangs the size of tusks.

08:13.701 --> 08:16.496
Only reason I'm here
is because Apollo had my back.

08:17.288 --> 08:18.122
Okay.

08:20.333 --> 08:23.586
"Callie"? You've absolutely
never called me that before.

08:25.004 --> 08:25.963
Like, ever.

08:27.548 --> 08:28.424
Hmm.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.719
Tell us your last words to him. Come on.

08:32.929 --> 08:35.264
Oh, I don't remember.

08:36.557 --> 08:38.518
"I don't remember."
Don't be all modest now.

08:38.601 --> 08:40.561
-You know what you said.
-Come on.

08:40.645 --> 08:42.897
"You been juicing, bloodsucker?"

08:46.150 --> 08:47.777
All right, just quick housekeeping.

08:47.860 --> 08:50.530
So, that Nightcrawler
you were never going to see again?

08:50.613 --> 08:54.617
Sent me a text you were at her house,
and Paolo was picking you up.

08:54.700 --> 08:57.537
And Savannah PD called.

08:58.204 --> 09:00.665
You're no longer a person of interest
in the Cook case.

09:01.499 --> 09:03.209
It pays to have connections.

09:03.292 --> 09:05.753
Guild wouldn't have done that
if they didn't trust us.

09:06.337 --> 09:07.672
I'm thinking that we're okay.

09:07.755 --> 09:11.008
But we probably wouldn't be if he
hadn't gotten the monster out of here.

09:11.509 --> 09:14.428
That doesn't mean she should have
been here in the first place.

09:20.268 --> 09:21.394
You okay, Theo?

09:23.020 --> 09:24.814
Yeah, just a little heartburn.

09:25.898 --> 09:26.857
You sure?

09:27.692 --> 09:32.280
Yeah, I'm just, I'll go
lay down for a second. Excuse me.

09:34.323 --> 09:36.576
Let me know if you want me
to bring you something.

09:36.659 --> 09:37.493
-Okay?
-Okay.

09:39.912 --> 09:43.291
That boy can take on a vamp,
but not a little heartburn?

09:44.083 --> 09:45.960
Babe, pass me one of them biscuits.

10:21.829 --> 10:22.663
Oh, my God.

10:54.195 --> 10:56.614
If you trust me, I'll get what we want.

11:41.701 --> 11:45.121
What the hell, sweet little,
you almost hit my car.

11:45.830 --> 11:48.874
-Maybe I should have.
-Someone sounds hangry.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.626
Have you fed today?

11:55.965 --> 11:59.009
-Where did you find that?
-Where did you leave it?

12:00.845 --> 12:03.723
Easy with the interrogation,
Sebastian Junior.

12:04.724 --> 12:07.143
I had a lovely dinner

12:07.226 --> 12:10.938
and I don't need your petulance
affecting my digestion.

12:17.111 --> 12:20.740
I asked you a question
and I want an answer.

12:24.243 --> 12:26.078
-Elinor!
-Juliette!

12:36.839 --> 12:37.673
Okay, then.

12:38.507 --> 12:42.970
I am exhausted, sticky,
and I need a shower.

12:44.263 --> 12:47.600
But if you have a point,
I'll allow you to make it.

12:52.354 --> 12:54.190
Calliope is devastated.

12:57.526 --> 13:00.029
And there's nothing I can do
to make it better.

13:01.030 --> 13:04.533
You knew how much she meant to me,
and you destroyed her family anyway.

13:05.117 --> 13:07.369
She will never recover from this.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.789
The whole Burns family
will never recover from this.

13:09.872 --> 13:13.042
What about your own family, Juliette?

13:14.001 --> 13:16.420
Her family just tried to kill me,

13:17.463 --> 13:20.090
but you are so wrapped up
in this hunter girl

13:20.174 --> 13:22.718
that you don't give a shit
about your own sister.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.804
No matter how much hell you raise,

13:25.429 --> 13:29.141
no matter how many lives you destroy,
you never feel bad about any of it.

13:29.225 --> 13:31.977
It is like you are completely devoid of--

13:32.061 --> 13:34.522
In Lilith's great name, I am so tired

13:34.605 --> 13:38.025
of having this moral compass
conversation with you.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.904
We are Legacy vampires.

13:41.987 --> 13:44.573
We don't follow rules. We make them.

13:44.657 --> 13:49.954
You are one confusing sappy version
of who we are,

13:50.037 --> 13:51.997
and I'm the version we should be.

13:53.082 --> 13:54.834
Truly, you're unteachable,

13:54.917 --> 13:58.337
-and I am exhausted from trying.
-I get it.

13:58.420 --> 14:01.215
This is the point where the Gaslight Queen
convinces her subject

14:01.298 --> 14:02.675
that she's the problem.

14:03.259 --> 14:06.846
Not this time. The truth is the truth.
And I am so tired of this.

14:06.929 --> 14:09.473
I am such an idiot
for taking so long to see this.

14:09.557 --> 14:13.602
You are a soulless murderer
and I am completely done with you.

14:19.859 --> 14:20.693
Good night.

14:25.155 --> 14:26.323
And get out.

14:42.172 --> 14:44.258
You wanna play truth till it hurts?

14:44.341 --> 14:48.971
None of us, you, me,
our dad who is still shedding,

14:49.054 --> 14:51.807
or those Burns brothers,
would be in this situation

14:51.891 --> 14:55.227
if you had just drained that
hunter girl dry when you had a chance.

14:55.311 --> 14:58.480
Or given your cowardice,
simply stayed away from her.

14:58.564 --> 15:01.108
Everything that has happened to all of us

15:01.191 --> 15:04.111
happened because
you didn't do the right thing.

15:05.279 --> 15:07.281
Theo's blood is on your hands.

15:08.198 --> 15:12.786
And as far as I'm concerned,
that is one Burns down, four to go.

15:17.082 --> 15:19.126
I will never forgive you for this.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.212
You better hope I forgive you.

15:42.358 --> 15:44.068
I can't believe you didn't want this.

15:46.487 --> 15:47.696
I'm just not hungry.

15:50.115 --> 15:51.533
I'm going to go see about Theo.

15:54.745 --> 15:55.663
Actually...

15:57.998 --> 15:59.375
we wanted to talk to you.

16:00.417 --> 16:03.337
Baby, will you leave us alone
with your sister?

16:04.838 --> 16:08.467
Um, well, actually,
I'm not finished eating, so...

16:08.550 --> 16:10.302
But you just said that you...

16:12.930 --> 16:14.640
Okay, eat then. Come on, Cal.

16:33.534 --> 16:37.371
Baby girl, we're concerned,
and clearly you've been on edge,

16:37.454 --> 16:38.747
which makes us suspicious.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.333
We have to assume it has something
to do with the vamp.

16:41.417 --> 16:45.045
It doesn't. I just have a lot on my mind.

16:45.129 --> 16:48.507
Calliope, there's been too many lies
told in this house,

16:48.590 --> 16:51.552
and I don't have the patience for more.
So here's where we are.

16:51.635 --> 16:55.723
The Guild helped clear your name,
but they're still watching us.

16:55.806 --> 16:58.058
Yeah, we've seen two vehicles
do drive-bys today.

16:58.142 --> 17:00.352
-And we know it's them.
-New rules.

17:00.436 --> 17:03.063
You don't leave this house
unless you're with one of us.

17:03.147 --> 17:04.982
We're getting you a new phone.

17:05.065 --> 17:07.484
Which means
you have to turn the old one in tonight.

17:08.193 --> 17:10.237
Hey, thanks for dinner, Mom.

17:10.320 --> 17:12.114
Yeah. You're welcome, baby.

17:13.282 --> 17:14.283
Come on.

17:14.366 --> 17:18.370
Cal, being anywhere near her
puts this whole family in jeopardy.

17:18.454 --> 17:21.415
And since clearly the severing
didn't break you up,

17:22.166 --> 17:24.126
we have to do what we have to do.

17:24.209 --> 17:26.837
Okay. Yeah, I get it.

17:27.546 --> 17:28.380
It's fine.

17:32.009 --> 17:33.010
May I be excused?

17:35.429 --> 17:38.474
Um, yeah. Yeah.

17:38.557 --> 17:42.603
And leave your room door open
at all times, so we can check on you.

17:42.686 --> 17:45.105
From now until we get out of this town.

17:45.189 --> 17:46.857
Okay, I will.

21:01.009 --> 21:03.011
Put your hands in the air, now!

21:03.929 --> 21:06.181
Sebastian?

21:11.728 --> 21:14.898
Excuse me, what's happening?
You cannot enter my home.

21:14.982 --> 21:16.483
Excuse me. Who is in charge here?

21:16.566 --> 21:18.485
Who is in-- Where's the warrant?

21:18.568 --> 21:20.821
-Where is your warrant?
-Dad!

21:20.904 --> 21:23.323
-Get her out of here.
-Where is your warrant?

21:23.407 --> 21:24.574
-Elinor!
-Hands up!

21:24.658 --> 21:26.201
I am the DA of Savannah.

21:26.285 --> 21:29.705
You cannot enter my home
without a goddamn warrant. Elinor.

21:29.788 --> 21:31.873
Do not fight, do not say a word.

21:32.457 --> 21:35.168
I will call a lawyer.
You'll be home in an hour.

22:09.536 --> 22:10.912
Maybe he wasn't dead.

22:10.996 --> 22:12.164
He was dead.

22:15.125 --> 22:18.337
-I'm gonna be sick.
-What are you two doing?

22:20.672 --> 22:21.548
What the hell?

22:25.010 --> 22:25.844
Theo?

22:27.846 --> 22:28.680
Theo?

22:30.640 --> 22:31.933
-Theo.
-Mom!

22:35.562 --> 22:38.148
-Mom, help me...
-No!

22:38.231 --> 22:39.483
Jack!

22:39.566 --> 22:41.693
Oh, my God. Baby, it's fine...

22:43.612 --> 22:44.905
Jack!

22:45.989 --> 22:48.825
Baby. Please.

22:48.909 --> 22:51.828
No!

22:51.912 --> 22:53.288
Jack!

22:54.581 --> 22:55.874
What are you doing?

22:55.957 --> 22:56.875
Stop!

22:56.958 --> 22:58.418
Let me go. No!

22:58.502 --> 23:00.837
Theo, stop fighting. Stop fighting!

23:01.630 --> 23:03.757
-Let me go!
-Stop fighting. Please.

23:10.889 --> 23:13.100
Be careful. Don't hurt him.

23:14.184 --> 23:16.019
Theo.

23:16.103 --> 23:19.064
Please help me understand how the hell
that this happened to you.

23:19.147 --> 23:21.191
If either of you know something,
tell me now.

23:23.402 --> 23:24.653
No, we don't.

23:27.989 --> 23:29.741
Cal, look at me. Baby.

23:29.825 --> 23:33.578
Go upstairs. All right?
You shouldn't see your brother like this.

23:33.662 --> 23:35.080
Yes. She should.

23:35.914 --> 23:38.333
She needs to see what vampires truly are.

23:38.834 --> 23:42.337
Why she needs to stay away
from that daywalking bloodsucker.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.172
He's her brother, Jack.

23:45.090 --> 23:47.426
No, he isn't.

23:48.009 --> 23:48.927
Dad.

23:50.720 --> 23:53.765
-Not anymore.
-Why would you say that?

23:53.849 --> 23:56.685
-Mom, no! Why would you say that?
-Come with me.

23:56.768 --> 23:59.187
-Come on, it's okay.
-Mom, no. He's wrong.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.440
-Please, do what Mommy says.
-Theo.

24:01.523 --> 24:03.483
-Theo! Mom...
-Baby, come on.

24:03.567 --> 24:05.861
-Cal! Cal!
-He's wrong.

24:07.070 --> 24:08.447
-Theo!
-Cal.

24:08.530 --> 24:10.240
-Theo!
-Come on, baby.

24:15.579 --> 24:18.331
-Ms. Fairmont...
-Nope. Lawyer.

24:21.293 --> 24:23.295
Sure you don't want to talk to me?

24:25.046 --> 24:26.923
I suppose this is the part where you say

24:27.007 --> 24:29.926
if I have anything to share,
it's a good time to do it.

24:33.346 --> 24:35.348
There is something, actually.

24:38.602 --> 24:41.938
The flecks of marinara
on your tie match perfectly

24:42.022 --> 24:44.149
with the ones stuck in your teeth.

24:45.817 --> 24:47.861
You know, life behind bars?

24:47.944 --> 24:50.697
It's a long time
for a pretty young thing like you.

24:50.780 --> 24:53.241
How fortunate for me that I'll never know.

24:55.994 --> 24:57.871
<i>A buck says that's my lawyer.</i>

24:58.622 --> 25:00.081
-About time.

25:03.793 --> 25:07.672
That'll be all, detective.
I trust my client's been treated well.

25:13.428 --> 25:14.262
Counselor.

25:22.354 --> 25:23.313
Counselor.

25:24.856 --> 25:26.691
She's lawyered up, turn it off.

25:28.276 --> 25:30.695
Aren't you going to say, "I object"?

25:30.779 --> 25:33.949
Or, you know, something equally sassy?

25:34.658 --> 25:38.161
I object to your unkempt hair,

25:38.245 --> 25:41.289
your repulsive presence,
and your dumb grin.

25:41.373 --> 25:44.668
I knew she was weak, but I can't believe
Juliette let you talk her into this.

25:44.751 --> 25:46.002
Is that what you think happened?

25:46.086 --> 25:48.380
She couldn't have pulled it off
on her own.

25:48.463 --> 25:50.924
And therein lies your fatal flaw.

25:51.007 --> 25:54.302
Your bloated sense of self
makes you underestimate everyone.

25:54.928 --> 25:56.429
You crushed her soul, El.

25:57.722 --> 26:01.977
You gave her a reason to hate you.
A reason to destroy you by any means.

26:03.478 --> 26:04.312
So she did.

26:04.396 --> 26:08.775
I tried to shape my little sister
into a proper Legacy.

26:09.693 --> 26:11.736
The same way Mother molded me.

26:11.820 --> 26:13.947
Wounded animals are dangerous,

26:14.030 --> 26:16.908
especially when they know where
you keep the key to your Murder Locker.

26:19.327 --> 26:20.704
You remember Mr. Green?

26:25.625 --> 26:26.459
I loved him.

26:27.961 --> 26:28.962
I begged Mom...

26:32.674 --> 26:33.508
Margot...

26:34.884 --> 26:36.052
to let me bring him home.

26:37.554 --> 26:38.388
I was two.

26:39.806 --> 26:41.057
But you hated him.

26:41.141 --> 26:42.934
His tank smelled like a sewer.

26:43.768 --> 26:45.437
I can't believe you still have that.

26:59.993 --> 27:03.955
Are you seriously trying to blame
your stupid turtle's death on me?

27:05.332 --> 27:08.251
That is some next-level
toxic masculinity, Oliver.

27:08.335 --> 27:09.377
No, I killed him.

27:11.254 --> 27:12.881
With my little five-year-old hands.

27:14.841 --> 27:19.179
With an assist from my manipulative
evil-from-birth twin, I did it.

27:20.639 --> 27:24.267
<i>But let's not forget about our old</i>
<i>camp counselor Stephanie.</i>

27:25.393 --> 27:29.898
<i>And then there was super-kind</i>
<i>Dr. Deborah, our therapist.</i>

27:33.193 --> 27:36.988
<i>"Drain her and you won't have to take</i>
<i>those yucky pills anymore," you told me.</i>

27:38.239 --> 27:40.825
<i>And you never would have had</i>
<i>your first kill.</i>

27:41.701 --> 27:43.828
-You're welcome.
-You're a sociopath.

27:44.579 --> 27:46.289
You made everyone believe I was evil.

27:48.458 --> 27:49.584
But it was all you.

27:57.550 --> 28:00.845
You know, I spent most of my time in exile
trying to answer one question:

28:03.390 --> 28:06.935
-"Why?"
-That's what you were focused on?

28:07.686 --> 28:11.064
What a waste of five good years
of your life.

28:11.147 --> 28:13.817
You could've actually gone to law school.

28:13.900 --> 28:14.734
Yeah.

28:20.615 --> 28:22.826
Can you tell me, Elinor?

28:27.122 --> 28:28.123
I really need to know.

28:29.207 --> 28:31.292
You really want to know, huh?

28:31.376 --> 28:32.377
I really do.

28:42.303 --> 28:43.805
I just felt like it.

28:47.016 --> 28:49.477
When Dad finds out you were here...

28:50.395 --> 28:51.229
Excuse me?

28:54.107 --> 28:55.150
Did you say Dad?

28:57.277 --> 29:00.196
Elinor, you really should have
paid more attention

29:00.280 --> 29:01.906
when they shipped me off to Prague.

29:02.574 --> 29:04.075
Oh, let me guess.

29:05.201 --> 29:10.039
Dad told you to stay quiet,
just be a good Fairmont.

29:14.252 --> 29:17.505
And Mom told you that everything
would be okay, right?

29:20.091 --> 29:21.593
They won't leave me here.

29:23.595 --> 29:24.596
They already did.

29:25.889 --> 29:27.223
It's a matriarchy,

29:27.807 --> 29:30.101
nothing matters more
than protecting the reputation

29:30.185 --> 29:31.478
of the Keeper of the Malkia.

29:36.024 --> 29:38.401
I'm really gonna love watching you burn.

30:40.296 --> 30:41.130
Jack.

30:42.215 --> 30:43.049
Honey.

30:43.591 --> 30:45.760
Do me a favor,
and move away from that cabinet.

30:46.803 --> 30:47.804
Why?

30:49.013 --> 30:50.890
You're making me nervous.

30:53.685 --> 30:57.397
How could you be so calm
when the whole goddamn world is ending?

30:57.480 --> 30:59.482
I can't afford to be anything but.

30:59.566 --> 31:01.442
That's how we've always done it, baby.

31:02.277 --> 31:04.779
When one is weak, the other is strong.

31:04.863 --> 31:08.283
And which one of us
is the weak one right now, huh?

31:08.366 --> 31:10.743
Someone's gotta make sure
you won't use anything

31:10.827 --> 31:12.912
inside of that on our son.

31:12.996 --> 31:16.332
And I'd feel a lot better
if you'd come sit down.

31:17.125 --> 31:18.668
So we can figure this out.

31:19.335 --> 31:23.381
There's nothing to figure out, T.

31:26.092 --> 31:28.845
My son, my blood...

31:30.471 --> 31:32.682
cannot be this thing.

31:34.517 --> 31:36.644
I can't let it stand.

31:36.728 --> 31:39.689
You know, I don't even know
what that means, Jack.

31:41.232 --> 31:45.236
You can't "let it stand."
What else can we do but let it stand?

31:45.320 --> 31:47.363
-You know what I mean.
-I don't know anything,

31:47.447 --> 31:50.575
because there is no way
you're going to do anything--

31:50.658 --> 31:54.162
-I have to put him down, Talia.
-You're not killing our son.

31:54.245 --> 31:59.042
That vampire chained in the basement
is no more my boy

31:59.125 --> 32:03.254
-than the monster who turned him.
-He is still Theseus Burns, Jack.

32:03.338 --> 32:06.257
Named after your grandfather
and your great-grandfather.

32:06.341 --> 32:09.260
-He cannot live in this hou--
-Over my dead body.

32:12.388 --> 32:13.222
There.

32:13.932 --> 32:15.308
You made me say it.

32:17.018 --> 32:22.106
You will kill our son over my dead body.

32:57.100 --> 32:58.518
You're exhausted.

33:00.311 --> 33:02.438
Maybe you should try to go to bed.

33:02.522 --> 33:05.942
We have lost two of our children.
Sleep is the last thing on my mind.

33:06.025 --> 33:07.318
We haven't lost them.

33:07.402 --> 33:11.197
Oliver is Oliver. I always hold out hope
he'll come around, and Elinor...

33:12.365 --> 33:14.325
Maybe prison
will be a learning experience.

33:14.409 --> 33:15.743
Why would she stay in prison?

33:15.827 --> 33:19.038
Not only does she drain humans for fun,
she has that memory reset power

33:19.122 --> 33:21.207
we've asked her
a million times not to use.

33:21.290 --> 33:23.626
I have to say, sweetheart,
you're ridiculously calm

33:23.710 --> 33:27.005
for someone whose daughter
just put us at risk in both of our worlds.

33:33.469 --> 33:34.470
She won't do it.

33:35.013 --> 33:36.014
Why wouldn't she?

33:36.723 --> 33:38.850
It's still about power with Elinor.

33:39.600 --> 33:43.980
She wants to be the Keeper too badly
to massacre a whole police department,

33:44.522 --> 33:47.859
and get banished by the clan
for the attention it brings.

33:51.362 --> 33:54.365
I remember your mother screaming,
telling you you'd be sorry

33:54.449 --> 33:57.076
if you had children
with "that vampire" you made.

33:57.160 --> 33:59.954
Maybe it wasn't just anger,
and she knew something we didn't.

34:00.038 --> 34:02.540
-That our bloodlines weren't meant to mix.
-Hey.

34:05.293 --> 34:08.546
It's Mother's usual nonsense.
You know she's a bigot.

34:09.380 --> 34:10.214
Was.

34:18.139 --> 34:20.308
I realize that we show
affection differently,

34:20.391 --> 34:22.477
but I love our children, Sebastian.

34:23.311 --> 34:25.730
-With my whole heart.
-But your primary responsibility

34:25.813 --> 34:27.315
is to the Emerald Malkia.

34:27.398 --> 34:29.859
I know that, and the Keeper vows
to lay down her life

34:29.942 --> 34:31.736
to protect the mother serpent.

34:31.819 --> 34:35.198
Elinor was the Keeper-in-Waiting,
and it didn't make her any less reckless,

34:35.281 --> 34:37.241
so I think she'll have
to stay put a while.

34:37.325 --> 34:40.119
The Legacy Families?
How do we explain this?

34:41.496 --> 34:43.998
Council in Budapest is six months away.

34:44.832 --> 34:47.376
That gives us plenty of time to come up

34:47.460 --> 34:51.255
with a plausible reason
for Mother's disappearance.

34:51.339 --> 34:55.301
Till then... we focus on Juliette.

34:57.553 --> 34:59.055
She's our beacon of hope.

35:01.015 --> 35:03.518
She doesn't want our life, sweetheart.

35:03.601 --> 35:07.021
She will, once she gets over
that hunter girl.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.816
And she will.

35:11.901 --> 35:15.238
Young love never lasts.

35:17.031 --> 35:17.865
Ours did.

35:38.469 --> 35:43.015
This is exactly what I want from you,
for the next thousand years.

35:47.145 --> 35:47.979
A thousand?

35:48.646 --> 35:50.148
You promised me eternity.

35:59.740 --> 36:00.658
Come on.

36:21.679 --> 36:24.432
Awfully late for a delivery, isn't it?

36:30.646 --> 36:31.606
What's going on?

36:34.025 --> 36:35.067
Legacy Sentry.

36:36.319 --> 36:37.403
He delivered this.

36:41.949 --> 36:44.452
"You are hereby notified
the Legacy Council

36:44.535 --> 36:48.915
is challenging the fitness
of Keeper of the Malkia, Davina Atwood.

36:48.998 --> 36:51.959
As the Keeper-in-Waiting,
your presence is required to appear

36:52.043 --> 36:55.796
in front of the Council Court
on the first Monday after the New Moon."

36:55.880 --> 36:57.173
That's in two days.

36:58.925 --> 37:03.971
Okay, let's not panic.
That gives us two days to figure this out.

37:04.055 --> 37:05.932
What is there to figure out?

37:06.015 --> 37:09.227
The Legacy Council is challenging
Mother's fitness as the Keeper,

37:09.310 --> 37:13.814
and I doubt that she will be there
to defend herself, given that you ate her.

38:00.486 --> 38:02.780
You stay away from my fucking son.

38:21.882 --> 38:22.758
Does it hurt?

38:24.719 --> 38:25.845
Stupid question.

38:28.264 --> 38:31.225
I mean, this is my fault.

38:32.101 --> 38:34.437
I know I did this to you, and I just...

38:35.187 --> 38:39.275
I wish I could remember why or how.
I just-- I don't.

38:42.111 --> 38:42.987
I'm sorry.

38:51.996 --> 38:53.372
Come on, think, Apollo.

38:54.498 --> 38:55.499
Come on, focus.

39:02.590 --> 39:05.343
<i>I remember chopping it up with Elinor.</i>

39:06.218 --> 39:07.845
But I was completely sober.

39:09.638 --> 39:11.640
I only took one sip.

39:14.643 --> 39:18.647
And I know I would have tried to help you.
I know I would have tried.

39:29.450 --> 39:31.577
She's involved in this somehow.

39:36.123 --> 39:38.209
Do you hear me? Yo!

39:41.504 --> 39:42.463
Theo, let me go!

39:47.426 --> 39:48.761
Are you gonna kill me?

39:50.930 --> 39:53.057
Do it. Do it!

39:57.353 --> 40:01.023
I deserve to die.
I'm the reason this happened to you.

40:02.191 --> 40:04.568
I'm sorry. Go ahead.

40:05.486 --> 40:06.612
I'm sorry.

40:16.038 --> 40:18.833
Theo, don't do it! Theo!

40:22.420 --> 40:23.254
Theo!

40:25.840 --> 40:26.674
Theo!

40:29.510 --> 40:30.678
Shit!

40:33.389 --> 40:34.223
Theo!

40:38.936 --> 40:39.770
Wait.

40:41.313 --> 40:42.690
Theo, stop!

40:47.278 --> 40:49.071
Theo, I don't wanna fight you.

41:00.916 --> 41:03.919
Theo, this isn't you.
I don't want to fight you.

41:06.964 --> 41:09.800
Please, stop fighting before you get hurt.

41:15.806 --> 41:16.974
Oh, God.

41:40.873 --> 41:41.874
Hold on.

41:41.957 --> 41:42.791
Wait.

41:45.085 --> 41:45.920
Please.

41:47.004 --> 41:50.007
It's not his fault. He's confused.

41:52.259 --> 41:53.219
And he's hungry.

41:54.178 --> 41:55.513
He's just been turned.

41:55.596 --> 41:58.182
-You'd know, your sister did this to him.
-I can help him.

41:58.265 --> 41:59.934
How can a monster help?

42:01.769 --> 42:04.438
-Is it okay if I come closer?
-Absolutely not.

42:08.817 --> 42:13.697
To a new vampire,
every sound is too much noise.

42:16.116 --> 42:18.494
The thirst for blood feels unquenchable.

42:20.079 --> 42:22.873
It's impossible to think through it all
until it feeds from...

42:27.670 --> 42:28.879
the one who made it.

42:50.442 --> 42:51.610
Cal.

42:52.278 --> 42:53.946
-You did this?
-No.

42:54.029 --> 42:56.073
-No.
-You turned my brother?

42:56.156 --> 42:58.492
-Can you come with me...
-I'm sorry.

43:04.832 --> 43:06.625
-Cal, I can explain--
-What, Juliette?

43:07.585 --> 43:09.211
What could you possibly say to me?

43:11.005 --> 43:12.298
He asked for my help.

43:42.244 --> 43:45.331
Help me.

44:15.569 --> 44:19.615
<i>I was trying to drain him,</i>
<i>so he could die with dignity.</i>

44:21.033 --> 44:22.660
I hope you're at peace now.

44:30.542 --> 44:32.878
Elinor is responsible for Theo's death.

44:34.171 --> 44:38.092
I just wanted to make things right,
or as right as I could.

44:38.175 --> 44:41.679
As right as you could?
Thought you were some kind of savior?

44:42.721 --> 44:45.474
No. I didn't know what I'd done.

44:45.557 --> 44:48.185
-I never would've--
-You turned my brother into a monster.

44:48.852 --> 44:49.895
-Cal--
-That's what you did.

44:49.978 --> 44:51.980
And you knew that's not what
he was asking you to do.

44:52.064 --> 44:54.024
So enough
with always playing the innocent.

44:55.025 --> 44:58.404
The "I don't know what I am,
I don't know how this works" bullshit.

44:59.697 --> 45:01.240
When you sank your fangs into him,

45:01.323 --> 45:04.743
you knew there was a chance
you could turn him. True or false?

45:06.620 --> 45:10.165
Let's go with true.
You know what else is true?

45:12.209 --> 45:16.922
You made him the thing he was raised
to hate and trained to kill.

45:17.005 --> 45:19.091
The thing that murdered his mother.

45:20.426 --> 45:22.136
-That wasn't your choice to make.
-No.

45:23.095 --> 45:24.722
I know that and I'm sorry.

45:24.805 --> 45:26.390
Sorry won't bring my brother back.

45:26.473 --> 45:27.391
I know that.

45:28.934 --> 45:30.769
So then why are you still standing here?

45:33.480 --> 45:35.107
-Please. Leave.
-Cal.

45:35.190 --> 45:36.942
-Now.
-Cal, don't do this!

45:37.025 --> 45:39.570
You'll give Elinor exactly what
she wanted, what they all wanted:

45:39.653 --> 45:40.988
for us to not be together.

45:41.071 --> 45:42.990
Do you think I care
what your family wants?

45:44.491 --> 45:46.744
Let me make this as plain to you as I can.

45:47.411 --> 45:50.122
-Stay the hell away from me.
-I love you.

45:52.374 --> 45:53.751
And I know you love me.

45:54.501 --> 45:57.588
There is no way you can just turn
your feelings off for me like that.

46:01.341 --> 46:02.885
I'm not telling you again.

46:25.324 --> 46:27.451
You can stake me
if it'll make you feel better.

46:28.327 --> 46:30.329
But you know I won't die.

46:33.749 --> 46:34.583
That's right.

46:36.043 --> 46:38.504
You're a very "special" kind of monster.

46:40.798 --> 46:45.093
But I will spend the rest of my life
trying to figure out

46:45.177 --> 46:47.763
how to kill you and every Legacy like you.

46:52.976 --> 46:53.811
I'm sorry.

46:55.437 --> 46:56.688
I'm so, so sorry.

47:08.492 --> 47:10.410
<i>She needs to see</i>
<i>what vampires truly are.</i>

47:11.829 --> 47:14.873
<i>Why she needs to stay away</i>
<i>from that daywalking bloodsucker,</i>

47:14.957 --> 47:16.625
<i>I have to put him down!</i>

47:23.340 --> 47:24.508
There's no other option.

47:27.886 --> 47:29.555
We put him down tonight.

47:29.638 --> 47:31.932
Pops, please. Wait, I'm...

47:33.600 --> 47:35.018
Give me the tape.

47:35.102 --> 47:37.145
-Come on, hurry up. Give me the tape.
-Pops...

47:39.356 --> 47:41.859
-No!
-I don't wanna hear it.

47:44.903 --> 47:47.281
A beast like this killed his mother.

47:48.240 --> 47:52.244
Theo and I promised each other
we would avenge her death.

47:52.327 --> 47:55.414
We talked about
which weapons we would use.

47:56.373 --> 47:57.666
We were going to celebrate.

47:58.667 --> 48:01.587
Right down to the 16-year-old
bottle of Scotch

48:01.670 --> 48:03.463
that we'd open in her honor.

48:04.047 --> 48:07.509
Jack, our son is sick.

48:07.593 --> 48:08.510
My son.

48:10.304 --> 48:15.559
My son... the one I love
with everything in me,

48:16.268 --> 48:18.103
wouldn't want to live this way.

48:19.771 --> 48:25.068
If I really love him, then I have to kill
the beast that has taken him.

48:26.069 --> 48:27.988
I'm Theo's mother, Jack.

48:29.865 --> 48:33.327
I'm Theo's mother, Jack!

48:34.870 --> 48:37.289
And I have been since he was 7 years old.

48:38.749 --> 48:43.879
You know, I can't just stand by
while you take my baby.

48:46.632 --> 48:50.469
Apollo, please help your father

48:50.552 --> 48:53.513
understand that
we're not killing your brother.

48:54.264 --> 48:55.557
Please.

48:57.601 --> 48:58.727
Please.

48:59.686 --> 49:01.980
I don't want to live in a world
without my brother.

49:05.067 --> 49:06.401
But my brother's gone.

49:08.153 --> 49:08.987
Dad's right.

49:17.871 --> 49:19.873
Jack, we have always been
on the same page.

49:20.791 --> 49:21.917
Always.

49:22.918 --> 49:27.130
So I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong.

49:28.590 --> 49:34.388
But if you tell me I'm wrong,
and you really believe it,

49:35.389 --> 49:40.310
-I will stand by you, but my heart...
-Come on.

49:40.394 --> 49:41.353
Okay.

49:48.276 --> 49:49.111
I'm sorry.

49:52.781 --> 49:56.201
I love you,
and I'll never be good without you.

49:58.203 --> 50:00.539
It's the Burns brothers forever, right?

50:05.794 --> 50:08.922
It's the Burns brothers forever,
all right? I'm sorry.

50:11.258 --> 50:14.469
I need to say goodbye,
and then I want to do it myself.

50:14.553 --> 50:17.472
-No, I'm not with that.
-Yes.

50:19.349 --> 50:21.309
Take some time, just you and him.

50:22.728 --> 50:24.354
And then we do it together.

50:28.525 --> 50:29.359
Okay.

50:31.319 --> 50:32.696
Okay. Together.

50:34.865 --> 50:35.699
Okay.

50:54.426 --> 50:56.553
You are everything to me.

51:00.098 --> 51:02.851
From the first time I laid eyes on you...

51:06.104 --> 51:07.814
you have been my heart.

51:10.442 --> 51:13.195
I'm still going to be around
whether I marry your dad or not.

51:15.238 --> 51:16.281
You know why?

51:22.454 --> 51:27.292
Because I love you... with my whole heart.

51:32.255 --> 51:33.632
My whole heart.

51:41.473 --> 51:42.682
My whole heart.

52:22.139 --> 52:23.056
Shit.

52:36.820 --> 52:38.238
What have you done, Tee?

52:47.289 --> 52:49.499
<i>Hi, you've reached Talia's voicemail.</i>

52:49.583 --> 52:51.293
<i>Leave a message after the beep.</i>

53:15.233 --> 53:20.822
<i>Act II, Scene 6,</i>
<i>Friar Laurence advises Romeo</i>

53:20.906 --> 53:23.241
<i>that violent delights</i>
<i>have violent endings.</i>

53:23.325 --> 53:25.368
-Juliette!
-<i>"Therefore, love moderately."</i>

53:27.370 --> 53:29.080
<i>It makes sense to me now.</i>

53:30.749 --> 53:31.917
<i>I fell too deeply.</i>

53:34.794 --> 53:38.965
<i>Had I never met Juliette Fairmont,</i>
<i>maybe I could have loved moderately.</i>

53:39.591 --> 53:43.553
<i>Had I never met Calliope Burns,</i>
<i>maybe I could have loved moderately.</i>

53:44.679 --> 53:47.891
<i>And I never would have been</i>
<i>in this much pain.</i>

54:37.107 --> 54:39.484
Okay. Come on. It's okay.

54:41.653 --> 54:46.658
No. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

54:48.159 --> 54:49.828
Come on. Come on.

54:57.961 --> 54:59.587
You will always be my son.

55:02.382 --> 55:03.758
No matter what.

55:07.345 --> 55:09.264
You will always be my son.

55:09.806 --> 55:10.724
Okay?

55:14.894 --> 55:18.606
Now, I know you have to feed,
but don't hurt anyone, okay?

55:18.690 --> 55:22.944
Please, just be careful.
You're a trained warrior.

55:23.778 --> 55:25.989
You know how to look out
for trained warriors?

55:27.324 --> 55:32.454
And you never forget that in here,
you are human.

55:33.621 --> 55:34.456
Okay?

55:35.832 --> 55:36.708
My baby.

55:48.887 --> 55:50.889
Thank you for doing this, Oliver.

55:55.518 --> 55:57.562
You're the best mom
I've ever met, Ms. Talia.

55:58.897 --> 56:00.857
I'm happy to help you in any way.

56:01.733 --> 56:02.650
This is my son.

56:04.319 --> 56:05.153
You hear me?

56:05.695 --> 56:06.946
He's in good hands.

56:20.835 --> 56:24.214
It's okay.
Welcome to your new family, brother.

56:30.261 --> 56:32.472
Please, after you.

56:48.947 --> 56:51.366
I came back to Savannah
for one reason, Theseus.

56:53.243 --> 56:54.619
To ruin some lives.

56:55.495 --> 56:56.746
And as you can see...

56:58.623 --> 57:00.083
I brought some friends with me.

57:01.543 --> 57:04.754
You, me and this woman...

57:08.591 --> 57:10.218
we're gonna run this bitch.
