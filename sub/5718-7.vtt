Good morning,
cubicle monkeys.

00:07.833 --> 00:10.445
Here are the invitations
for the Welltopia banquet.

00:10.532 --> 00:12.403
Now, due to this frivolous
expenditure,

00:12.490 --> 00:14.144
I'm afraid we're gonna
have to go back
to low-speed internet.

00:15.972 --> 00:18.192
Anybody has a problem
with that, they can email me.

00:18.279 --> 00:20.585
Or if you want
quicker results,
you can write an email,

00:20.672 --> 00:23.240
print it up,
and walk it over
to my office.

00:23.327 --> 00:25.808
Low-speed internet?
Pat, we do tons
of charting online.

00:25.895 --> 00:28.071
You are not the only one
affected by this.

00:28.158 --> 00:29.290
I mean, it's gonna
take me forever

00:29.377 --> 00:31.205
to download my por...

00:36.862 --> 00:38.342
Welltopia banquet?

00:38.429 --> 00:41.171
Yeah, it is turnt up!

00:41.258 --> 00:44.609
Open bar,
both alcohol and taco,

00:44.696 --> 00:48.178
and the best doctor/performer
in the valley doing his thang.

00:48.265 --> 00:50.267
Ken gets up on stage
and makes fun of people.

00:50.354 --> 00:51.703
It's called satire,
Damona.

00:51.790 --> 00:53.140
Yeah, Damona.

00:53.227 --> 00:54.750
He holds a mirror up

00:54.837 --> 00:57.013
to the daily foibles
of the medical profession.

00:57.100 --> 00:59.798
Okay, do near-sighted guy
giving a urine sample.

00:59.885 --> 01:01.148
Okay.

01:06.588 --> 01:08.285
He can't even
see the cup!

01:18.165 --> 01:20.210
Hey.
Where are the kids?

01:20.297 --> 01:21.951
[DOOR SLAMS] Dave's upstairs.
Molly's not home.

01:22.038 --> 01:23.735
Really? Just us?

01:23.822 --> 01:26.173
[CHUCKLES]
Bring it, yeah. [CHUCKLES]

01:27.304 --> 01:28.958
Wait.

01:29.045 --> 01:30.612
What's with your mouth?
What do you got
planned there?

01:30.699 --> 01:31.830
You'll see.

01:34.137 --> 01:37.314
[CLEARS THROAT]

01:37.401 --> 01:40.187
Congrats on still having
a spark and everything,
but yuck.

[DOOR CLOSES]

01:41.797 --> 01:43.364
Okay, get this.

01:43.451 --> 01:46.541
I have to write an essay
on what I want
my career to be.

01:46.628 --> 01:48.673
I'm about the journey,
not the destination.

01:50.980 --> 01:53.635
Look, it's a
school assignment.
You got to do it.

01:53.722 --> 01:55.202
Yeah, everything in life
involves things

01:55.289 --> 01:56.681
you don't want to do. Thank you.

01:56.768 --> 01:58.074
Like in work. Yes.

01:58.161 --> 02:00.903
Or in marriage. What?

02:00.990 --> 02:03.906
But I'm 16.
I don't know what
my calling's gonna be.

02:03.993 --> 02:07.257
Speaking of calling, oh,
it's your homework assignment.

02:07.344 --> 02:09.520
Uh-huh. It says,
"You complete me."

02:09.607 --> 02:10.434
[BOTH CHUCKLE]

02:12.001 --> 02:13.394

02:13.481 --> 02:15.744
[LAUGHING]
Yes, he is.

02:15.831 --> 02:18.921
Your dad might be
the funniest primary care
physician in the valley.

02:19.008 --> 02:21.489
You heard your mom.
Funniest person in the world.

02:24.579 --> 02:27.103
And if you're a fan
of my comedy,
and I know I am...

02:27.190 --> 02:29.323
You're gonna love me
at this banquet.

Oh. "Oh" what?

02:39.855 --> 02:43.032
No, it's just, I think
this is the Kevin O'Connell
I dated in med school.

02:43.902 --> 02:45.339
[LAUGHING] Oh, yeah!

02:45.426 --> 02:48.516

about seeing Kevin McPale,

Oh, come on,
it'll be fine.

03:10.799 --> 03:12.540
And I'm sure
he'll be cool with it, too,

03:12.627 --> 03:14.672

away from the whiskey
and women's skirts.

You know, 'cause Irish guys
wear those plaid skirts.

03:18.285 --> 03:19.982
Or maybe
it's the Scottish.

03:20.069 --> 03:21.549
Don't' worry,
I'll be warmed up
by show time.

03:30.862 --> 03:33.735
Oh, here's my invitation
to the banquet in case
you want to take someone.

03:33.822 --> 03:35.258
Whoa,
you're not going?

03:35.345 --> 03:37.565
No. Big parties
make me nervous.

I am not good
at schmozing.

03:40.698 --> 03:42.222
Okay, well, you better
get good at it.

03:42.309 --> 03:44.224
You want to specialize
in internal medicine, right?

03:44.311 --> 03:46.835
Yes. I'm all about

Yep, don't need
the back story.

Listen, I'm trying
to help you out here.

about this other
Dr. Kevin O'Connell,

by Irish parents.

she's been in her entire life.

about hypertension.

I'm your attending
and your mentor.

06:05.887 --> 06:07.018
You should be asking me.

06:07.105 --> 06:08.759
I did,
but you were busy

06:08.846 --> 06:10.761
botching an imitation
of Christopher Walken.

06:13.198 --> 06:14.852
It's an impression.

Uh, besides, Dr. O'Connell
is a plastic surgeon,

06:17.986 --> 06:20.292
so unless your patient
wants giant fake boobs,

have to tell me.

it's attractive.

I read that one.

06:57.678 --> 06:59.070
Because usually
when studies come,

06:59.157 --> 07:00.637
you do that thing where
you throw them in the trash

07:00.724 --> 07:01.856
and say,
"I already got the job."

07:04.946 --> 07:06.643

I read this one in bed,

07:06.730 --> 07:08.906
and I was not impressed.

and vigorously made love
to my wife, who was awake.

been our dad?

that way.

you wouldn't be you.

for the banquet,

08:39.867 --> 08:42.043
so I invited him over
for dinner.

in the kitchen.

No, no, no.

to say wow.

I'm saying wow.
[MOCKINGLY] Wow.

09:01.845 --> 09:03.630
Why the hell
would you bring
him here?

09:03.717 --> 09:06.110
Because
I'm petty and dramatic.

09:06.197 --> 09:07.677
And I wanted to see
the look on your face

09:07.764 --> 09:09.897
when you got caught
in a big fat lie,
and it did not disappoint.

Why didn't you ever tell me
what this guy looked like?

09:14.118 --> 09:15.946
I don't know!
You never asked.

if a guy named
Kevin O'Connell

happens to be the hottest
Korean guy in the world?

09:21.169 --> 09:23.214
I didn't tell you
because of this.

09:23.301 --> 09:26.478
I knew how you'd react,
and it wasn't worth it.

09:26.566 --> 09:30.395
Oh, oh.
I'm not upset about him.
I'm upset about the lie.

09:30.482 --> 09:31.788
You're also upset
about him.

09:31.875 --> 09:34.008
Of course
I'm upset about him!

He's Korean Channing Tatum!

I'm sure you have an ex

than you let on.

09:40.449 --> 09:43.583

myself better.

Remember Karen,
the cute girl
I dated in college?

09:48.631 --> 09:50.241
I totally made her up.

09:50.328 --> 09:52.330
But you said
she dumped you.

09:52.417 --> 09:54.637
I wanted
to make it believable.

09:54.724 --> 09:56.639
Look, I admit
I was wrong not
to tell you about Kevin,

09:56.726 --> 09:59.163
but it was
20 years ago, Ken.

09:59.250 --> 10:01.165
You need to put on
your big-boy pants
and act like a grownup.

10:01.252 --> 10:03.385
[SCOFFS]
This is not the time

10:03.472 --> 10:05.822
to mock my slight frame
and delicate features.

10:08.782 --> 10:10.784
Molly was just telling me
how she wants to be a doctor.

10:10.871 --> 10:12.873
You never said
you wanted to be a doctor.

10:12.960 --> 10:15.702
That was before.
Kevin inspired me.

10:15.789 --> 10:17.181
He's a real role model.

10:19.662 --> 10:21.882
Dad, look.
Kevin helped me
finish the DNA model

10:21.969 --> 10:23.274
I asked you
to help me with,

10:23.361 --> 10:25.973
and you said,
"Not now, son.
We'll do it later."

10:26.060 --> 10:27.148
And two years went by.

10:30.064 --> 10:32.066
Kevin, this is
so embarrassing,

10:32.153 --> 10:33.371
but we're gonna have
to take a rain check
on dinner.

10:33.458 --> 10:34.764
What?

10:36.679 --> 10:37.941
I hope
everything's okay.

10:38.028 --> 10:40.683
Oh, yeah,
it's just my friend,

10:40.770 --> 10:42.206
Barb Rutledge. [CHUCKLES]

10:42.293 --> 10:44.774
We're throwing her
an intervention.

10:44.861 --> 10:46.036
It's paint fumes.

10:46.689 --> 10:47.951
And pot.

10:49.910 --> 10:52.652
[CLEARS THROAT]
She's been huffing...

10:53.217 --> 10:55.219
And puffing.

10:55.306 --> 10:56.656
We're worried she might
blow her house down.

10:58.875 --> 11:00.616
Anyway,
we're really sorry.

11:00.703 --> 11:02.705
Uh, it's all good.

11:02.792 --> 11:04.533
You know, gives me a chance
to hit the gym,
grab a workout.

11:04.620 --> 11:06.143
Yeah, that's clearly
what you need.

11:07.754 --> 11:10.017
Catch you guys
at the banquet tomorrow?

11:10.104 --> 11:11.801
It was good seeing
you again, Alli. [CHUCKLES]

11:29.732 --> 11:32.866
Why is "comedy"
in quotes?

11:32.953 --> 11:34.302
Yeah, that's what
everyone's looking at.

11:36.957 --> 11:38.567
Hey, you two look great.

11:38.654 --> 11:40.482
I feel great

11:40.569 --> 11:42.614
for someone
who's been lied to
for the past 20 years.

11:44.355 --> 11:46.053
Glad you found a tux
that fit a big, fat baby.

11:48.098 --> 11:50.274
Okay, your small talk
leaves something
to be desired.

11:58.195 --> 11:59.196
Hi. Ooh!

12:00.458 --> 12:02.460
Wow.

12:02.547 --> 12:04.071
I told you
I'm terrible
at networking.

12:04.158 --> 12:06.421
It's okay, I got you.

12:06.508 --> 12:08.336
Um, okay,
don't look now.

12:08.423 --> 12:10.425
11 o' clock, it's the chief
of internal medicine.

12:10.512 --> 12:13.167
Great.
I will be back
in three hours.

12:13.254 --> 12:14.385
What? No.

12:14.472 --> 12:16.518
[CHUCKLES]
The blond by the bar.

12:16.605 --> 12:17.649
Talk to him.

12:18.476 --> 12:20.000
[SIGHS] God, okay.

12:21.436 --> 12:22.959
Here I go.

12:23.046 --> 12:24.700
Need four gin and tonics
for table six.

12:27.659 --> 12:30.053
Hi.
I'm Dr. Julie Dobbs.

12:30.140 --> 12:31.925
Austin.

12:32.012 --> 12:33.317
Can I get you something?

12:33.404 --> 12:36.364
Oh, that's so nice of you.
No, I'm fine.

12:36.451 --> 12:37.582
Augh. [CHUCKLES]

12:39.323 --> 12:40.890
Um...

12:40.977 --> 12:45.286
So, uh, what do
you like to do
when you're not at work?

12:45.373 --> 12:48.419
Um, I play bass
in a garage band.

12:48.506 --> 12:49.290
I like to snowboard.

12:49.377 --> 12:51.335
Oh! Me too.

12:51.422 --> 12:52.597
Really?No.

12:54.469 --> 12:56.819
Okay,
I'm really not good
at this whole thing.

12:56.906 --> 12:58.168
I just...

12:58.255 --> 12:59.996
Austin, I just
wanted to say

13:00.083 --> 13:02.259
that I would love to work
for you one day.

13:02.346 --> 13:03.521
Really?Yeah.

13:03.608 --> 13:06.002
And if you let me,

13:06.089 --> 13:07.787
you would see
that no one works as hard
or wants it more than I do.

13:10.485 --> 13:11.529
Word.

13:11.616 --> 13:12.617
Thank you so much.

13:12.704 --> 13:14.271
No big. Peace.

13:15.185 --> 13:16.099
Peace.

13:18.928 --> 13:19.799
How did it go?

13:21.104 --> 13:22.627
Really well.

13:22.714 --> 13:24.455
For the first time,

13:24.542 --> 13:26.588
I feel like I took
a big step forward
in my career, you know?

13:26.675 --> 13:28.242
Aww. See?

13:28.329 --> 13:29.417
Aww.

13:30.505 --> 13:31.811
So good.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.987
Come. Sit.

13:34.074 --> 13:35.684
Oh, there they are.
[CHUCKLES]

13:35.771 --> 13:37.207
Oh, Alli, how'd it go
with your friend Barb?

13:38.469 --> 13:40.167
Oh, she's fine.

13:40.254 --> 13:41.908
She's...in the army now.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.650
Oh, cool.

13:45.737 --> 13:47.435
Uh, Ken, man,
I am pumped to see
your skits tonight.

13:47.522 --> 13:49.480
Yeah, thanks, buddy.

13:49.567 --> 13:50.786
Will you excuse me?

13:54.529 --> 13:56.226
He just referred
to what I do as "skits".

13:56.313 --> 14:00.927
Oh, my God,
what a gorgeous idiot.

14:01.014 --> 14:04.060
They're not skits.
They're biting
satirical commentary.

14:04.147 --> 14:05.409
He just crossed the line.

14:05.496 --> 14:07.411
Wait,
that crossed a line?

14:07.498 --> 14:09.892
Not that he
upstaged you at work
or pleasured your wife.

14:11.372 --> 14:12.764
Who said
he pleasured her?

14:12.852 --> 14:14.375
Oh, yeah.

14:14.462 --> 14:15.855
Yeah, I'm sure
that must've been
a pretty grim slog.

14:21.512 --> 14:24.254
Welcome, everyone.
Uh, just a quick announcement.

14:24.341 --> 14:28.606
Seems we've all gone
a little scan-happy
with the new MRI machine.

14:28.693 --> 14:30.565
Remember,
that's very expensive
to operate,

14:30.652 --> 14:32.697
so when it comes
to diagnosing patients,

14:32.784 --> 14:35.570
let's not discount the value
of good, old-fashioned...

14:35.657 --> 14:36.876
guesswork.

14:39.530 --> 14:42.533
Now, if you could all
feign interest
in a brief video tribute

14:42.620 --> 14:45.275
to this year's honoree,
Dr. Kevin O'Connell.

14:48.844 --> 14:50.193
It just happens.
It just...

14:52.761 --> 14:53.980
What are you doing?

14:54.067 --> 14:55.851
All of the old stuff is out.

14:55.938 --> 14:58.636
Tonight is Operation
Shred Kevin O'Connell,

14:58.723 --> 15:01.117
which is my way
of saying I'm gonna
shred Kevin O'Connell.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.294
Now help me think
of his flaws.

15:04.381 --> 15:06.122
[EXHALES DEEPLY]

15:06.209 --> 15:08.559
Oh, this is good.

15:08.646 --> 15:12.346
Do you happen to know
if he's punctual?

15:12.433 --> 15:16.045
Because, you know,
if not, that can be
mildly annoying.

15:18.004 --> 15:20.267
Oh, who am I kidding?

15:20.354 --> 15:21.094
No one would mind
waiting five minutes
for that.

15:22.834 --> 15:23.879
Whose side are you on?

15:23.966 --> 15:25.315
Yours, always.

15:25.402 --> 15:27.143
[GASPS]

15:27.230 --> 15:29.015
Did he say something
about wanting me
on his side?

15:30.407 --> 15:32.192
I can't stand that guy!

15:32.279 --> 15:35.369
He's not even a real doctor.
He's just a plastic surgeon.

15:35.456 --> 15:39.851
His whole world
is just nips and noses,
lips and butts.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.158
My work isn't about
restoring appearance.

15:42.245 --> 15:43.943
It's about restoring dignity.

15:45.422 --> 15:47.076
NARRATOR:
After the earthquake,

15:47.163 --> 15:50.123
Dr. O'Connell
rushed to Haiti
to help the children.

15:50.210 --> 15:52.647
KEVIN:
When a child sees a reflection

15:52.734 --> 15:54.257
and the physical scars
are healing,

15:55.955 --> 15:57.913
well, maybe then

15:58.000 --> 15:59.567
the emotional ones
can begin to heal, as well.

16:02.178 --> 16:04.311
You notice
how he's always
rubbing his shoulder?

16:04.398 --> 16:05.399
[CHUCKLES]

16:05.486 --> 16:07.792
Dude, you're ripped.
We get it.

16:07.879 --> 16:10.926
"Oh, look at me,
I have discernible shoulders.

16:11.013 --> 16:14.408
"When I put on a backpack,
it doesn't just slide off."

16:14.495 --> 16:16.453
Wait, is that why
you never wear
a backpack?

16:16.540 --> 16:19.021
That and if it's too heavy,
I fall backwards, okay?

16:20.849 --> 16:22.720
But I can work with this.
He's shoulder-proud.

16:22.807 --> 16:24.331
Nobody likes that.

16:24.418 --> 16:28.639
[CHUCKLES]
"Shoulder...proud."

16:28.726 --> 16:31.686
NARRATOR:
As Dr. O'Connell ran out
of the crumbling building,

16:31.773 --> 16:33.905
carrying the two children
to safety,

16:33.993 --> 16:37.648
the roof collapsed,
shattering his shoulder.

16:37.735 --> 16:39.520
But not the puppy
cradled beneath it.

16:41.609 --> 16:43.132
KEVIN: You know,
shoulders can be replaced.

16:44.046 --> 16:45.265
Lives can't.

16:47.310 --> 16:48.964
[APPLAUSE]

16:49.051 --> 16:50.183
[CHEERS]

16:52.837 --> 16:53.838
Wow.

16:53.925 --> 16:55.362
[APPLAUSE]

16:55.449 --> 16:57.799
Okay, hot crowd.
Hot crowd!

16:57.886 --> 16:59.148
[LAUGHS]

16:59.235 --> 17:00.323
Whoo! Yeah. Go, go, go.

17:00.410 --> 17:01.672
Wow, there really
is just nothing there.

17:01.759 --> 17:04.458
Okay.

17:04.545 --> 17:07.678
Wow, that is
some inspiring stuff.

17:07.765 --> 17:10.116
Oh, I just...
I would not want
to have to follow that.

17:12.161 --> 17:15.295
Up next,
the comedy stylings
of Dr. Ken Park.

17:15.382 --> 17:16.687
[LIGHT APPLAUSE]

17:16.774 --> 17:18.341
[LAUGHS] Whoo!

17:18.428 --> 17:19.560
[BARKS]

17:19.647 --> 17:20.778
[LAUGHS]

17:20.865 --> 17:22.911
So, let's get into it.

17:22.998 --> 17:26.480
How about our honoree,
Dr. Snip and Tuck?

17:26.567 --> 17:27.350
Oh!

17:29.439 --> 17:30.527
Hey, nothing annoying

17:30.614 --> 17:32.877
about how he rubs
his shoulder so much.

17:32.964 --> 17:35.315
We get it, Kev,
you go to the gym.

17:35.402 --> 17:36.968
I guess he needs
those strong shoulders

17:37.056 --> 17:38.840
to haul those giant bags
of boob juice

17:38.927 --> 17:40.059
into everyone's chest.
[LAUGHS]

17:42.670 --> 17:43.627
Boob juice?

17:48.458 --> 17:49.372
Um...

17:51.374 --> 17:52.941
Okay, who likes
impressions?

17:54.943 --> 17:56.988
Me too.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.686
Um, uh,
this is my impression

17:58.773 --> 18:01.080
of one of Dr. O'Connell's
patients at a funeral.

18:05.171 --> 18:10.306
"I so sad."

18:10.393 --> 18:12.221
Oh, because
their skin is so tight
that all they can do is...

18:12.308 --> 18:13.527
I got some others. Um...

18:15.224 --> 18:18.227
Uh, I mean,
there are pimps out there

18:18.314 --> 18:20.534
who haven't cut
as many faces as
that guy, am I right?

18:21.317 --> 18:22.318
[LAUGHS]

18:24.451 --> 18:25.452
[COUGHS]

18:26.409 --> 18:27.454
Come on.

18:27.541 --> 18:29.151
That guy's
raised more eyebrows

18:29.238 --> 18:31.849
than an interracial couple
in 1957!

18:31.936 --> 18:33.068
[LAUGHS]

18:35.070 --> 18:36.463
Uh, you know, it's okay
to laugh, everyone.

18:36.550 --> 18:38.943
I don't mind.
Laughter is the
best medicine.

18:39.030 --> 18:40.206
[LIGHT LAUGHTER]

18:42.817 --> 18:44.340
Of course
he's prescribing laughter.

18:44.427 --> 18:46.255
Tomorrow
he'll charge you five grand

18:46.342 --> 18:47.996
to blast your own ass fat
into those laugh lines.

18:48.823 --> 18:50.085
[LAUGHING]

18:51.956 --> 18:54.437
Hey, do Mr. T-cell!

18:54.524 --> 18:56.439
Aw, it's kind of dated.

18:56.526 --> 18:58.267
I pity the fool who don't
respect my immune system!

18:58.354 --> 18:59.529
[GRUNTS]

18:59.616 --> 19:01.183
[LAUGHTER]

19:01.270 --> 19:04.273
If your urine tastes
like lemonade concentrate,

19:04.360 --> 19:06.667
you might be a diabetic.

19:06.754 --> 19:08.669
[LAUGHING]

19:08.756 --> 19:11.019
That's all my time.
See you next year!

19:11.106 --> 19:12.238
[CHEERS]

19:12.325 --> 19:13.282
[APPLAUSE]

19:20.246 --> 19:21.638
Thanks.For what?

19:21.725 --> 19:23.292
Well, I was
dying up there.

19:23.379 --> 19:25.033
Even though
you were pissed at me,
you laughed anyway.

19:25.120 --> 19:26.730
Bailed me out.

19:26.817 --> 19:28.732
I wasn't bailing you out.
You were funny.

19:28.819 --> 19:30.778
Look, I know
I was a jerk about Kevin.

19:30.865 --> 19:32.258
I'm sorry.

19:32.345 --> 19:34.173
Yeah, you really
outdid yourself.

19:34.260 --> 19:36.087
I couldn't help it.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.959
Just thinking
about you with that guy

19:38.046 --> 19:40.266
made me feel like
the lonely, insecure doctor
I was when we met.

19:41.267 --> 19:43.443
Well, I get that.

19:43.530 --> 19:45.793
I guess sometimes
I was jealous of Karen.

19:45.880 --> 19:48.012
You know,
before I found out
she wasn't real.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.799
Ken,
he has nothing on you.

19:51.886 --> 19:54.280
I mean,
he is charming.

19:54.367 --> 19:55.194
Yeah, I don't see it.

19:57.674 --> 19:59.676
And attractive.

19:59.763 --> 20:01.939
It's a very
specific look.

20:02.026 --> 20:03.724
But there was no spark.

20:03.811 --> 20:05.726
Dating a guy like Kevin

20:05.813 --> 20:07.336
made me realize
I didn't want
someone perfect.

20:07.423 --> 20:10.034
I wanted you.

20:10.121 --> 20:13.386
Oh, babe, that is so close
to being a compliment.

20:13.473 --> 20:15.126
[BOTH CHUCKLE]

20:15.214 --> 20:18.260
Besides, I could
never end up with
someone like him.

20:18.347 --> 20:19.435
He's kind of pretentious.

20:19.522 --> 20:21.698
[LAUGHS] Kind of?

20:21.785 --> 20:25.528
"Look at me, I save lives
and can wear a backpack."

20:25.615 --> 20:28.923
"Look at me,
I restore dignity and
can do a million sit-ups."

20:29.010 --> 20:30.011
[LAUGHS]

20:30.098 --> 20:31.839
"Look at me,

20:31.926 --> 20:33.406
"I suffer from
an embarrassing
sexual dysfunction."

20:34.450 --> 20:35.495
No?

20:43.851 --> 20:45.200
Here's your dessert. Oh.

20:45.287 --> 20:46.462
And an application.

20:46.549 --> 20:47.855
What?

20:47.942 --> 20:50.466
Get it in quick,
you can work a bar mitzvah
this Sunday.

20:50.553 --> 20:53.077
Oh, Julie,
you're such an idiot.

20:53.164 --> 20:54.818
Hey, cut that out.

20:54.905 --> 20:56.646
At least
you put yourself
out there.

20:56.733 --> 20:59.736
You shouldn't be upset.
You should be celebrating.

20:59.823 --> 21:02.826
You're right.
Thanks, Damona.

21:02.913 --> 21:04.698
Uh, waiter, two glasses
of champagne

21:04.785 --> 21:06.134
for me and my friend.

21:06.221 --> 21:07.527
Excuse me?

21:07.614 --> 21:08.963
I'm the chief
of thoracic surgery.

21:10.007 --> 21:11.487
Okay.

21:11.574 --> 21:13.228
Yeah, maybe you should
fill this out.

21:13.315 --> 21:15.099
Yeah.

21:15.186 --> 21:16.840
I'm sorry to bug you guys.

21:16.927 --> 21:18.059
I've had a little
too much to drink,

21:18.146 --> 21:20.409
and my judgment's
kind of impaired.

21:20.496 --> 21:21.497
Can one of you guys
give me a ride home?

21:23.194 --> 21:24.326
I'll do it! I got it!

21:24.413 --> 21:25.545
No, no, no, no!
I got it!

21:25.632 --> 21:27.242
