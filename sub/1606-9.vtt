[Bell on PA] Chapman to
processing. Chapman to processing.

01:30.816 --> 01:33.567
I know I said toasted, Scott.

01:33.568 --> 01:35.027
If you cover it with a paper towel,

01:35.028 --> 01:38.290
it'll still be warm when
I finish the cavity search.

01:46.706 --> 01:48.985
- Take the N train.
- Thank you.

01:51.754 --> 01:53.471
Off you go.

01:54.672 --> 01:55.757
[Bell] Cough.

01:55.758 --> 01:57.633
[coughs]

01:57.634 --> 02:01.146
You can do better than
that. Shake out that pink.

02:03.724 --> 02:06.568
[coughs loudly]

02:07.394 --> 02:10.354
What could I possibly be
trying to take out of prison?

02:10.354 --> 02:14.242
It's procedure. Don't
look for logic. Stand up.

02:17.529 --> 02:20.707
[woman speaking indistinctly on PA]

02:21.825 --> 02:23.960
Change into these.

02:24.912 --> 02:27.880
Hurry up. Some of us have bagels to eat.

02:29.082 --> 02:32.584
Do you understand you will be subjected
to a urinalysis upon your return

02:32.585 --> 02:36.213
and said test is your own
financial responsibility?

02:36.214 --> 02:37.298
Yes.

02:37.299 --> 02:40.092
You may not purchase, sell,
possess, use, consume, or administer

02:40.093 --> 02:43.805
any narcotic drugs, marijuana,
alcohol, or intoxicants of any form

02:43.806 --> 02:45.722
or frequent places where such articles

02:45.723 --> 02:48.893
are unlawfully sold, dispensed,
used, or given away.

02:48.894 --> 02:50.519
- That was really impressive.
- Thanks.

02:50.520 --> 02:53.772
I sing it to the tune of Poker
Face in my head to remember.

02:53.773 --> 02:56.733
Lady Gaga? You wanna hear?

02:56.734 --> 02:58.328
No, that... that's okay.

03:00.363 --> 03:02.614
Go ahead, little bird. Fly free.

03:02.615 --> 03:03.950
[Cal] Pipette!

03:03.951 --> 03:05.034
[O'Neill] Is that your ride?

03:05.035 --> 03:07.119
Pegged you more for a yuppie than a hippie.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.662
See you in 48 hours, inmate.

03:08.663 --> 03:10.257
[squeals]

03:11.249 --> 03:13.843
[Cal] Come inside the Green Machine!

03:15.587 --> 03:17.847
[Piper] Oh! [Chuckles]

03:19.632 --> 03:20.967
- What?
- [sniffs]

03:20.968 --> 03:22.468
Why does it smell like tempura?

03:22.469 --> 03:25.596
Oh, yeah, vegetable oil. Get hip to it.

03:25.597 --> 03:28.933
Neri barters with this Teppanyaki
place up the road from us.

03:28.934 --> 03:31.944
Yuki loves Neri's fairy coats.

03:33.438 --> 03:34.739
[sighs]

03:35.482 --> 03:36.783
What's up?

03:38.068 --> 03:39.994
Just can't believe she's dead.

03:40.821 --> 03:43.206
I know. I know.

03:44.157 --> 03:46.325
If it makes you feel any
better, you didn't miss much.

03:46.326 --> 03:48.202
She just slept for a few days,

03:48.203 --> 03:51.423
and then the sleep stopped being temporary.

03:52.499 --> 03:55.209
I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.

03:55.210 --> 03:56.969
I told her for you.

03:58.171 --> 03:59.639
She knew, Piper.

04:01.216 --> 04:04.352
Ready? Seat belts, please.

04:08.295 --> 04:09.640
[man speaking indistinctly on PA]

04:09.641 --> 04:11.401
[Vee] Next.

04:12.394 --> 04:15.729
Three Mrs. Dash's Table Blend,

04:15.730 --> 04:21.277
four lemon juices, five adobo
powders, and two onion powders.

04:21.278 --> 04:23.695
Whoo-wee, chickadee.

04:23.696 --> 04:26.532
What do you need with all
these spices these days?

04:26.533 --> 04:28.868
Oh, that's none of your business.

04:28.869 --> 04:31.412
You must have a pretty hefty fund, huh?

04:31.413 --> 04:34.882
Those no-good sons finally
doing the right thing?

04:36.293 --> 04:38.502
Dmitri hit it big with a scratcher ticket?

04:38.503 --> 04:40.880
Don't you dare talk about my family.

04:40.881 --> 04:43.549
Maybe your little market turned around

04:43.550 --> 04:46.010
in spite of the economy and everything.

04:46.011 --> 04:47.629
Let's keep the line moving, inmates.

04:47.630 --> 04:50.181
- The spices, please.
- [Vee] All righty.

04:50.182 --> 04:55.144
[sighs] It just warms my heart to
see you finding your way in here,

04:55.145 --> 04:58.480
settling in with the AARP crowd.

04:58.481 --> 05:02.327
Gardening looks like a
comfortable little life.

05:03.070 --> 05:04.153
Next.

05:04.154 --> 05:06.748
Nicky. Nicky!

05:07.615 --> 05:08.782
I need a favor.

05:08.783 --> 05:10.409
Well, that's gonna cost you.

05:10.410 --> 05:11.577
What's your price?

05:11.578 --> 05:12.869
Oatmeal pies.

05:12.870 --> 05:16.790
The Little Debbie ones that leave
that oily residue all over your hands,

05:16.791 --> 05:18.551
but are still somehow delicious.

05:19.544 --> 05:20.962
Done.

05:20.963 --> 05:24.631
I need you to bring all the girls
to the greenhouse tomorrow...

05:24.632 --> 05:26.092
at dinnertime.

05:26.093 --> 05:29.761
That'll run you two boxes.
And if you want my opinion,

05:29.762 --> 05:31.763
you're going about this all wrong.

05:31.764 --> 05:34.683
This is going to be really special.

05:34.684 --> 05:37.519
You know, another layer
of icing on a shit cake

05:37.520 --> 05:38.937
doesn't make it taste good.

05:38.938 --> 05:40.647
I don't understand what you...

05:40.648 --> 05:43.400
Well, you know what you haven't said, Red?

05:43.401 --> 05:45.328
[door opens]

05:59.292 --> 06:02.336
498! Interfering with a staff
member in performance of duties.

06:02.337 --> 06:05.047
Didn't your boyfriend teach you how
to treat a staff member, Floppy Tits?

06:05.048 --> 06:08.425
That's a shot! Hey! What's
on your shirt there, Pigpen?

06:08.426 --> 06:13.430
Shit? Tears? Potato chips?
330! Being unsanitary.

06:13.431 --> 06:19.429
Shot! I don't like your
face. 312. Insolence. Shot!

06:21.356 --> 06:22.648
Huh.

06:22.649 --> 06:25.577
Mendez is back, bitches.

06:31.824 --> 06:33.242
What the hell is he doing here?

06:33.243 --> 06:35.244
Why, yes, John, it's a beautiful morning.

06:35.245 --> 06:37.121
Peaceful, even.

06:37.122 --> 06:39.206
He endangers the inmates,
and you know it, sir.

06:39.207 --> 06:42.469
I mean, it can't even be
legal to have him here, can it?

06:44.003 --> 06:46.263
- Would you like to have a seat?
- No.

06:48.133 --> 06:51.009
His suspension is up, so we're
gonna have to deal with it.

06:51.010 --> 06:52.719
And between you and me,

06:52.720 --> 06:56.515
some of the administration
feel there's a job to do.

06:56.516 --> 06:58.975
No one else is up to the task.

06:58.976 --> 07:00.144
I'm up to the task.

07:00.145 --> 07:03.406
Good. Prove it.

07:04.357 --> 07:05.825
I will.

07:08.153 --> 07:11.572
Why don't we start with why
you're here. In your opinion.

07:11.573 --> 07:15.835
Well, it was... suggested to me...

07:16.828 --> 07:18.412
by more than one person.

07:18.413 --> 07:21.873
So... [sighs] Uh, Dr. Maser...

07:21.874 --> 07:24.886
Oh, just "Chris," please. I'm not a doctor.

07:25.878 --> 07:28.848
[sighs] Maybe this was a bad idea.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.551
Well, it's okay to be uncomfortable, Sam.

07:32.552 --> 07:35.804
It's a feeling I would
encourage you to embrace.

07:35.805 --> 07:38.065
Embrace it? I live it.

07:39.267 --> 07:41.235
My whole life is uncomfortable.

07:42.104 --> 07:45.439
All these women, criminals,
bureaucratic idiots.

07:45.440 --> 07:48.275
I don't even feel at home
in my own home anymore.

07:48.276 --> 07:51.570
And now I'm sitting in an office
with some weird painting of frogs,

07:51.571 --> 07:54.240
which I'm guessing is
supposed to be soothing.

07:54.241 --> 07:58.160
Sam, I'm hearing a lot of stress.

07:58.161 --> 08:00.581
Yeah, well, that doesn't
even begin to cover it, okay?

08:01.331 --> 08:03.675
Do you like your job?

08:05.502 --> 08:09.013
I used to. I really did.

08:10.132 --> 08:11.715
I felt useful.

08:11.716 --> 08:13.509
And what changed?

08:13.510 --> 08:15.261
Hell if I know.

08:15.262 --> 08:16.854
I got older.

08:18.640 --> 08:20.567
Maybe I care less.

08:22.894 --> 08:26.021
Maybe I've seen enough to know
that I won't make a difference.

08:26.022 --> 08:27.856
That it's all a waste.

08:27.857 --> 08:30.076
You know... [sighs]

08:30.860 --> 08:35.405
sometimes we get stuck seeing
things from one perspective,

08:35.407 --> 08:40.327
but if we can just shift our
perspective even a little bit,

08:40.328 --> 08:42.246
makes all the difference.

08:42.246 --> 08:43.923
That's it?

08:44.999 --> 08:48.001
That's your fancy, $75-an-hour advice?

08:48.002 --> 08:50.921
Are you uncomfortable
with the amount I charge?

08:50.922 --> 08:55.935
I thought we just established that
I'm uncomfortable with everything!

08:57.429 --> 08:59.263
Are you always this quick to anger?

08:59.264 --> 09:01.649
Are you always a condescending cunt?

09:06.438 --> 09:10.492
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

09:11.651 --> 09:13.026
[sighs]

09:13.027 --> 09:15.862
Well, I think we have
our work cut out for us.

09:15.863 --> 09:17.624
My shoes feel tight.

09:18.908 --> 09:21.160
But I'm saying this guy, Heinrich Dreser,

09:21.161 --> 09:23.912
deserves to be right up
there on the bad-guy shelf.

09:23.913 --> 09:27.666
So, our buddy Heinrich oversaw
the development of heroin at Bayer.

09:27.667 --> 09:32.296
Yep. So, the corporate suits at
Bayer sold this shit over the counter

09:32.297 --> 09:35.882
as a non-addictive morphine
substitute in the early 1900s,

09:35.883 --> 09:37.509
and you know why they called it heroin?

09:37.510 --> 09:38.927
'Cause when they started testing it,

09:38.928 --> 09:42.306
people said it made
them feel heroic. Right?

09:42.307 --> 09:48.562
I'd like to stand up here and
be all inspiring and recovered

09:48.563 --> 09:51.482
and tell you I'm over it,

09:51.483 --> 09:54.485
but I miss it every fucking day, you know?

09:54.486 --> 09:59.999
Uh, heroin is the love of my
life, she's my best girlfriend...

10:01.075 --> 10:03.369
she's my soul mate,

10:03.370 --> 10:06.538
'cause, you know, she makes
me feel better than anything.

10:06.539 --> 10:07.840
[chuckles]

10:08.833 --> 10:10.885
So, in closing, uh...

10:12.044 --> 10:14.305
fuck the Germans. [Snickers]

10:16.216 --> 10:19.385
Okay, that's it for today, kids.

10:19.386 --> 10:24.265
Strength to accept what you cannot change,

10:24.266 --> 10:28.570
magical fairy dust, unicorns, etcetera.

10:31.523 --> 10:33.815
Hey. Rosa, right?

10:33.816 --> 10:35.567
How kind of you to remember.

10:35.568 --> 10:38.069
Did you read this? It's
about kids with cancer.

10:38.070 --> 10:40.656
I don't know why the sick fuck
wanted to write about this.

10:40.657 --> 10:44.200
Anyway, I... I thought it
might be right up your alley.

10:44.201 --> 10:47.037
I got enough depressing shit in my life.

10:47.038 --> 10:48.955
I don't need it in my books, too.

10:48.956 --> 10:52.584
So, what's your escape, then,
huh? Is it pain pills, booze?

10:52.585 --> 10:55.379
Everybody needs a little bit of
help with reality now and then.

10:55.380 --> 10:58.257
The thing about reality...

10:58.258 --> 11:02.228
is it's still there waiting
for you the next morning.

11:04.597 --> 11:07.599
Nice talk. They must've
loved you on the debate team.

11:07.600 --> 11:08.684
Oh, yeah.

11:08.685 --> 11:11.353
I was first place Original
Oratory two years running.

11:11.354 --> 11:14.230
You know, until I got expelled
for breaking my coach's toe.

11:14.231 --> 11:16.567
Long story, not for now.

11:16.568 --> 11:17.901
Maybe one day.

11:17.902 --> 11:20.162
Uh, yeah, sure.

11:21.113 --> 11:23.833
[man speaking indistinctly on PA]

11:42.969 --> 11:44.771
[clears throat]

11:45.805 --> 11:47.889
I am here to unburden you.

11:47.890 --> 11:49.433
You got my goods?

11:49.434 --> 11:51.101
You got most of them already.

11:51.102 --> 11:55.105
Ooh, I'm not fluent in Russian,
but in Spanish and English,

11:55.106 --> 11:57.566
"most of them" means not all of them.

11:57.567 --> 12:01.069
Gloria, you know me. The
rest will be here soon.

12:01.070 --> 12:02.446
I'm a woman of my word.

12:02.447 --> 12:05.616
And I'm a woman who gets
paid on time in full.

12:05.617 --> 12:08.494
Reznikov, you're out of bounds.

12:08.495 --> 12:09.962
What did you call me?

12:10.830 --> 12:12.330
Get back in bounds right now.

12:12.331 --> 12:14.416
Since when do you care where I am?

12:14.417 --> 12:16.292
That's a shot.

12:16.293 --> 12:18.920
307, refusing to obey an
order from a staff member.

12:18.921 --> 12:20.756
He's your bulldog now?

12:20.757 --> 12:22.007
Oh, no. Don't look at me.

12:22.008 --> 12:24.342
He's off leash, and I don't
want to get bitten, either.

12:24.343 --> 12:25.937
I'll see you around.

12:27.805 --> 12:30.015
Don't let me catch you
anywhere near the kitchen again.

12:30.016 --> 12:31.650
You know the drill.

12:35.647 --> 12:39.158
You're going to make a great father.

12:50.119 --> 12:52.922
[woman speaking indistinctly on PA]

12:56.709 --> 12:58.344
[Anita] You okay, hon?

12:59.170 --> 13:01.547
Fine, yes. Thank you.

13:01.548 --> 13:04.726
It's an adjustment. That's what they say.

13:05.718 --> 13:07.511
Your commissary come through yet?

13:07.512 --> 13:09.555
- No.
- No? Me, either.

13:09.556 --> 13:12.599
Haven't brushed my teeth
since we came in yesterday.

13:12.600 --> 13:15.060
Starting to feel like an
angora sweater in there.

13:15.061 --> 13:17.363
[woman speaking indistinctly on PA]

13:20.066 --> 13:21.567
[Anita] Oh, uh...

13:21.568 --> 13:25.403
There's this lady in here, Carla,
she'll wanna do that for you.

13:25.404 --> 13:28.582
I've been around before. I got it.

13:30.993 --> 13:33.254
I gotta take a leak.

13:38.417 --> 13:41.262
You Parker? Rhonda.

13:42.171 --> 13:45.224
Brought you some stuff,
a little welcome basket.

13:46.383 --> 13:48.060
We'll see you at breakfast.

13:50.096 --> 13:51.522
I don't eat breakfast.

13:52.306 --> 13:54.275
It upsets my stomach.

14:00.022 --> 14:03.826
You eat it now. Let's go.

14:10.783 --> 14:11.992
Want some of this?

14:11.993 --> 14:13.494
No, thank you.

14:13.495 --> 14:16.547
Three toothbrushes in
here. It's just showing off.

14:17.915 --> 14:20.802
Here. Take one, please.

14:23.254 --> 14:24.596
Thank you.

14:26.298 --> 14:28.634
[Vee] Get some toothpaste, too.

14:28.635 --> 14:31.270
You're very kind.

14:34.140 --> 14:37.308
[sighs] You got assigned a work detail yet?

14:37.309 --> 14:39.645
Kitchen.

14:39.646 --> 14:41.229
That's a plum gig.

14:41.230 --> 14:44.274
Yes, feels like home.

14:44.275 --> 14:47.653
My family, we own a small
market, and I serve food there.

14:47.654 --> 14:50.822
Yeah? You a good cook?

14:50.823 --> 14:53.918
I am very good. And get this.

14:54.952 --> 14:58.163
I use the same produce people
that the kitchen here uses.

14:58.164 --> 15:00.415
Although, if they delivered
me the shit they send here,

15:00.416 --> 15:02.918
I would throw it in their faces.

15:02.919 --> 15:05.262
They knew to give me the good stuff.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.057
They owed me.

15:09.091 --> 15:11.342
Now they really owe me.

15:11.343 --> 15:13.679
Neptune. Stupid name.

15:13.680 --> 15:17.316
I told them Neptune is
for seafood, not fruit.

15:19.476 --> 15:21.019
You know a vendor?

15:21.020 --> 15:24.698
Know them? They're here because of me.

15:25.858 --> 15:28.151
And I'm here because of them.

15:28.152 --> 15:31.747
You need to use that.
Make your life here better.

15:32.782 --> 15:35.167
Breaking rules got me in here.

15:36.703 --> 15:39.871
Yeah, well, I'm not telling
you what to do, you know.

15:39.872 --> 15:42.008
I'm just telling you how to survive.

15:49.924 --> 15:51.842
[Poussey] Next.

15:51.843 --> 15:56.387
Only one. I just learned I like a smoke
after I read my sexy-time novellas.

15:56.388 --> 16:00.016
It feels glamorous, but like, I'm
still not a real smoker, you know?

16:00.017 --> 16:03.186
Yeah, all right. Just make sure you
reshelve this book in its proper place.

16:03.187 --> 16:04.980
We on Dewey decimal and shit in here.

16:04.981 --> 16:08.066
Don't let me find no aquatic
sports over in paranormal phenomena.

16:08.067 --> 16:10.068
- Got it.
- All right.

16:10.069 --> 16:11.361
[woman speaking indistinctly on PA]

16:11.362 --> 16:12.704
Fuck you.

16:18.035 --> 16:19.879
[Poussey sighs]

16:23.165 --> 16:25.876
Oh, thanks, man. Heavy flow day over here.

16:25.877 --> 16:27.669
[both laugh]

16:27.670 --> 16:28.920
Ouch.

16:28.921 --> 16:30.546
I break your hand?

16:30.547 --> 16:33.049
Get back to your job.

16:33.050 --> 16:34.977
[doorbell buzzes]

16:35.928 --> 16:37.604
[sighs]

16:44.103 --> 16:48.106
Hi, I rang the bell. Is that weird?
I didn't wanna just walk right in.

16:48.107 --> 16:52.419
It... It's fine. You're fine. Wow, it's...

16:52.904 --> 16:54.905
You're actually here. It's crazy.

16:54.906 --> 16:56.457
Yeah.

16:57.241 --> 16:59.200
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:59.201 --> 17:00.744
- [Cal] No touching!
- [yelps]

17:00.745 --> 17:02.528
Sorry. I'm just trying
to ease your transition.

17:02.529 --> 17:04.539
Too much, too fast can
be a shock to the system.

17:04.540 --> 17:06.374
Like when POWs finally get to eat,

17:06.375 --> 17:08.795
and then they eat too much
and their stomachs explode?

17:09.796 --> 17:11.762
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:16.089 --> 17:17.593
- We can touch, though.
- Yeah, hello.

17:17.594 --> 17:19.012
Hello, good to see you.

17:19.012 --> 17:21.022
[Piper] Oh, my God.

17:21.766 --> 17:25.769
You never remember what home smells
like until you've been gone for a while.

17:25.770 --> 17:28.814
I remember that I always used to think
about that when I got back from camp,

17:28.815 --> 17:31.066
that I was smelling
what my friends smelled.

17:31.067 --> 17:32.451
What's it like?

17:33.110 --> 17:34.495
You.

17:38.700 --> 17:41.418
Laundry detergent. That, um...

17:42.328 --> 17:44.996
Those candles from Anthropologie.

17:44.997 --> 17:48.634
And... coffee.

17:49.501 --> 17:51.670
Coffee? Coffee?

17:51.671 --> 17:53.171
- Sure.
- Yeah.

17:53.172 --> 17:54.681
[Larry clears throat]

17:56.342 --> 17:59.010
Hey, is this all... is this all my stuff?

17:59.011 --> 18:00.095
It's your stuff.

18:00.096 --> 18:03.306
Why do I have so many clothes? My God.

18:03.307 --> 18:06.685
Did I really think that
I needed all of these?

18:06.686 --> 18:09.520
Oh, my God. Oh, my God,
my cashmere sweater!

18:09.521 --> 18:10.939
[Cal scoffs]

18:10.940 --> 18:13.233
Larry, which one has all my pants in it?

18:13.234 --> 18:15.318
Those are probably over at Polly's already.

18:15.319 --> 18:17.454
Oh, how is she?

18:17.989 --> 18:19.906
- Polly? Um...
- Yeah.

18:19.907 --> 18:23.118
She's fine. She's fine, I think. You know?

18:23.119 --> 18:28.539
She's probably not gonna make it tomorrow.
She's sleep training the baby and...

18:28.540 --> 18:29.624
[Piper] Oh...

18:29.625 --> 18:32.711
she said it's been... It's
been really tough on her, so...

18:32.712 --> 18:34.129
[sighs]

18:34.130 --> 18:37.465
Hey, I'm sorry about...
sorry about Celeste.

18:37.466 --> 18:38.591
Thanks, Bloomer.

18:38.592 --> 18:40.186
Oh, it's fine.

18:41.303 --> 18:42.929
No, it's not fine.

18:42.930 --> 18:45.482
It's not. Do you remember
that pillow that Mom had?

18:46.267 --> 18:49.770
The one with the cow on its back
and its legs were all up in the air?

18:49.771 --> 18:53.439
Uh, under the cow it
says, "I'm fine, really."

18:53.440 --> 18:55.566
What a stupid fuckin' pillow.

18:55.567 --> 18:57.693
Oh, I have it now.

18:57.694 --> 18:59.279
[grunts softly]

18:59.280 --> 19:01.281
Mmm. [Gulps]

19:01.282 --> 19:03.209
That's really good. [Chuckles]

19:04.285 --> 19:09.381
Ooh, upholstery. Upholstery is really good.

19:12.543 --> 19:16.587
You, uh... you could
stay here... if you want.

19:16.588 --> 19:21.060
Wow. You couldn't even try to
make that sound like you meant it.

19:22.344 --> 19:24.720
Well, lucky for you,

19:24.721 --> 19:27.933
it's in my furlough paperwork that
I have to stay with my parents.

19:27.934 --> 19:29.843
You know, I can wait in the
car if you guys would like...

19:29.844 --> 19:31.770
No. What do you want, Larry?

19:31.771 --> 19:32.854
I don't know.

19:32.855 --> 19:37.409
Okay, see, that's exactly how I do
not wanna spend these next two days.

19:38.194 --> 19:39.778
If I can't be with Grandmother,

19:39.779 --> 19:42.873
I'm going to at least
enjoy this trip for her.

19:43.699 --> 19:45.459
You know what we're gonna do?

19:46.368 --> 19:49.788
The Spotted Pig. Right?

19:49.789 --> 19:53.666
Burgers and rye Manhattans. That's
what we're gonna do. Who's with me?

19:53.667 --> 19:55.418
Aren't you not supposed to drink?

19:55.419 --> 20:01.267
Larry Abraham Bloom, I am
free for the next 48 hours.

20:02.009 --> 20:04.135
Do not ruin this by being a pussy.

20:04.136 --> 20:05.595
- [chuckles]
- Please.

20:05.596 --> 20:06.679
I could eat.

20:06.680 --> 20:08.056
See? Great. Cal?

20:08.057 --> 20:12.477
Yeah, you know, this sounds
great. I like where your head's at.

20:12.478 --> 20:16.231
It's great to know that you're still
a rule-breaking criminal at heart.

20:16.232 --> 20:19.775
But there's this one thing...

20:19.776 --> 20:23.122
- [piano playing]
- [guests whispering indistinctly]

20:23.823 --> 20:25.448
[Carol] Thank you for coming.

20:25.449 --> 20:28.076
Thank you for coming.

20:28.077 --> 20:30.661
Oh, good to see you,
darling. Thanks so much.

20:30.662 --> 20:31.746
[Bill] Thanks for coming.

20:31.747 --> 20:32.831
Nice to see you. Thanks.

20:32.832 --> 20:34.082
[Carol] Hi.

20:34.083 --> 20:35.583
Thank you so much for coming.

20:35.584 --> 20:37.460
She was great, yes.

20:37.461 --> 20:39.170
No, she doesn't have another granddaughter.

20:39.171 --> 20:41.965
That's actually me.
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. The felon.

20:41.966 --> 20:44.009
No, I am out. I'm just not out-out.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.343
It's called furlough.

20:45.344 --> 20:47.303
It's temporary, yeah.

20:47.304 --> 20:48.388
Forty-eight hours.

20:48.389 --> 20:52.017
It... It was nice of them to trust me.

20:52.018 --> 20:54.986
No, see? No handcuffs.

20:56.596 --> 20:57.756
How are you holding up, dear?

20:57.757 --> 20:59.308
How much longer do you
think this is gonna be?

20:59.309 --> 21:01.192
Not long. An hour or so?

21:01.193 --> 21:02.671
Okay, well, I was thinking that I might...

21:02.672 --> 21:07.615
Everyone's coming back to the house at
7:00, so we have to be there before then.

21:07.616 --> 21:11.536
Funeral's tomorrow at noon,
so eat a good breakfast.

21:11.537 --> 21:14.039
Everyone's very excited to visit with you.

21:14.040 --> 21:18.793
So they can all stare at
me like a lion in a zoo.

21:18.794 --> 21:21.462
Been a difficult day for everyone, dear.

21:21.463 --> 21:24.674
Hello, Mary. Thank you for coming.

21:24.675 --> 21:28.970
Celeste despised her. She
always wore kitten heels.

21:28.971 --> 21:32.182
You know how Grandmother felt about them.

21:32.183 --> 21:34.142
"The boiled carrots of footwear."

21:34.143 --> 21:36.061
[Carol chuckles]

21:36.062 --> 21:37.904
[indistinct conversations]

21:39.315 --> 21:43.068
Stick your fingers in a fucking
socket? What's wrong with your hair?

21:43.069 --> 21:47.072
Jesus Christ. What's
wrong with you, inmate?

21:47.073 --> 21:51.492
You meditating? Get some food.
Put some meat on your bones, shit.

21:51.493 --> 21:52.660
I'm not eating.

21:52.661 --> 21:55.580
I can see that, with my normal-people eyes.

21:55.581 --> 21:59.209
Bet those slits make it
hard for you to see, huh?

21:59.210 --> 22:02.545
I will report you to the administration.

22:02.546 --> 22:07.934
Ladies! Inmate... "Soso"?

22:08.719 --> 22:10.186
You're shittin' me, right?

22:10.930 --> 22:12.222
[Pornstache chuckles]

22:12.223 --> 22:18.386
Inmate Soso here seems to be
violating essential prison regulations

22:18.687 --> 22:22.949
with her insubordinate
attitude, does she not?

22:24.026 --> 22:26.745
[whispering] Take that, you tattletale.

22:28.905 --> 22:30.865
I am staging a hunger strike

22:30.866 --> 22:33.951
in protest of the reprehensible
conditions in this facility!

22:33.952 --> 22:35.989
I invite you all to join
in, in standing up...

22:35.990 --> 22:38.999
Oh, 212! Engaging in or
encouraging a group demonstration!

22:39.000 --> 22:42.293
Let's go talk about a little
extra work duty, shall we, Soso?

22:42.294 --> 22:44.262
[inmates whooping]

22:45.464 --> 22:48.309
Hey. Hey!

22:52.179 --> 22:55.774
Just... keep it down, please.

22:57.726 --> 23:00.278
[inmates talking indistinctly]

23:04.233 --> 23:05.650
[indistinct conversations]

23:05.651 --> 23:08.078
[Piper] Mmm. Mmm!

23:10.072 --> 23:12.207
Ooh, man.

23:13.075 --> 23:14.325
[crunching]

23:14.326 --> 23:17.453
Can't believe you're
wasting your time on lettuce.

23:17.454 --> 23:20.048
Do you know how long it's been since...

23:21.167 --> 23:24.302
I had a vegetable that actually crunched?

23:32.010 --> 23:33.636
Mmm.

23:33.637 --> 23:35.221
Whoa, easy there, Tiger. [Chuckles]

23:35.222 --> 23:38.817
Mmm. [Gulps] But it's so delicious.

23:41.770 --> 23:43.530
[Larry sighs]

23:45.857 --> 23:47.743
What are you doing?

23:49.945 --> 23:52.655
Mmm. I missed you.

23:52.656 --> 23:55.700
I missed you, too, Pipes.

23:55.701 --> 23:57.077
You wanna...

23:57.078 --> 23:59.537
No, I don't... I don't know, I...

23:59.538 --> 24:01.706
Oh, come on, Larry.

24:01.707 --> 24:03.874
How long has it been

24:03.875 --> 24:10.131
since you came in a real live
vagina and not in your hand?

24:10.132 --> 24:11.216
Huh?

24:11.217 --> 24:12.717
- Okay.
- Come on, let's go upstairs.

24:12.718 --> 24:16.104
No, I need to... I'm
gonna use the bathroom.

24:18.557 --> 24:20.984
I don't think you're supposed
to be drinking, honey.

24:21.768 --> 24:26.606
What's "supposed to," anyway,
you know? Who makes those rules?

24:26.607 --> 24:29.609
I believe it's the Federal Department
of Corrections in this case.

24:29.610 --> 24:31.068
Fuck 'em.

24:31.069 --> 24:33.779
The last thing anyone needs is
you getting your sentence extended

24:33.780 --> 24:35.531
for some silly furlough violation.

24:35.532 --> 24:37.125
Really, Dad?

24:38.160 --> 24:42.913
Is that the last thing that anyone needs,
or is that the last thing that you need,

24:42.914 --> 24:46.626
because you refuse to come visit
your only daughter in prison

24:46.627 --> 24:49.003
and you'd rather not have that
weighing on your conscience

24:49.004 --> 24:51.297
for any longer than it has to?

24:51.298 --> 24:55.060
Piper, can we not do this now,
please? My mother has died.

24:58.847 --> 25:02.600
Fine. Sorry.

25:02.601 --> 25:04.736
Celeste was so proud of you.

25:05.937 --> 25:07.230
From the moment you were born.

25:07.231 --> 25:09.607
It's hard to imagine that's true anymore.

25:09.608 --> 25:13.745
It was. I even think she liked
me more for having fathered you.

25:14.488 --> 25:15.914
[Bill sighs]

25:16.698 --> 25:19.960
I'm sorry, honey. I just
can't see you like that.

25:21.119 --> 25:22.537
Like what?

25:22.538 --> 25:24.205
You're my little girl.

25:24.206 --> 25:28.218
That woman in there,
that's not who you are.

25:30.212 --> 25:33.264
That's exactly who I am.

25:41.640 --> 25:43.057
[knocks on door]

25:43.058 --> 25:44.767
Larry?

25:44.768 --> 25:46.436
I'm in here, hello?

25:46.437 --> 25:49.146
- Hey, hey, hey! Pipes...
- Larry!

25:49.147 --> 25:50.565
- Whoa, whoa!
- [moans]

25:50.566 --> 25:53.276
Okay. Piper, not here. What if...

25:53.277 --> 25:56.904
Piper. Jesus, Piper. Oh,
God, are you sure about this?

25:56.905 --> 26:00.366
Is the door locked? Is the
door locked? Is the door locked?

26:00.367 --> 26:03.629
Shit. Oh, my God.

26:04.330 --> 26:06.757
[both grunting and moaning]

26:12.421 --> 26:13.722
- Fuck me.
- [unzipping]

26:14.798 --> 26:18.175
Okay. Okay, just move your leg over.

26:18.176 --> 26:20.303
- [Piper] Okay. Like that?
- Mmm-hmm.

26:20.304 --> 26:21.429
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

26:21.430 --> 26:23.306
Okay. [Moaning]

26:23.307 --> 26:27.017
- [grunts] Shit.
- What? Oh.

26:27.018 --> 26:29.354
- Fuck.
- It's okay. Let me help. Let me help.

26:29.355 --> 26:31.439
I'm sorry. I can't stop thinking
about your dad walking in.

26:31.440 --> 26:34.191
No! No! Oh, Jesus, Piper,
you don't have to...

26:34.192 --> 26:37.862
Oh, fuck. Come on, this is weird.
We're mourning. We're... [sighs]

26:37.863 --> 26:39.947
Ah... We haven't done this in
so long. We're not even together.

26:39.948 --> 26:41.824
Larry. Shut up.

26:41.825 --> 26:43.243
[breathes heavily]

26:43.244 --> 26:45.879
Fuck, I slept with someone.

26:51.877 --> 26:53.503
- Really?
- I'm sorry.

26:53.504 --> 26:57.214
You decide to tell me that with
your flaccid dick in my mouth?

26:57.215 --> 26:59.392
Ssh! It was a semi.

27:00.636 --> 27:03.271
Do not defend your boner to me right now.

27:04.055 --> 27:05.523
[sighs]

27:06.308 --> 27:07.859
[scoffs]

27:09.561 --> 27:11.687
[breathing heavily]

27:11.688 --> 27:13.230
I'm sorry. I know this is...

27:13.231 --> 27:14.532
[zipping]

27:15.609 --> 27:18.569
tough for you. Is there
anything you wanna ask me or...

27:18.570 --> 27:20.413
No. God, no.

27:25.744 --> 27:29.414
Maybe. Is it someone that I know?

27:29.415 --> 27:30.540
Yes. [Sighs]

27:30.541 --> 27:32.417
That's it. I don't
wanna know anything else.

27:32.418 --> 27:33.702
Please don't tell me anything else.

27:33.703 --> 27:38.172
Yeah, well, it's much worse when
you can imagine it in your own head.

27:38.173 --> 27:39.891
Trust me.

27:51.562 --> 27:53.071
[sighs]

27:59.945 --> 28:02.413
This is really over, isn't it?

28:07.453 --> 28:10.130
I don't... I don't want it to be.

28:13.875 --> 28:15.426
Yes, you do.

28:17.128 --> 28:18.596
[sighs]

28:23.259 --> 28:25.729
But it feels so shitty actually saying it.

28:42.112 --> 28:43.622
I know.

28:48.619 --> 28:50.461
[sighs heavily]

28:54.375 --> 28:57.427
[sighs] Fuck, I'm gonna miss you.

29:03.967 --> 29:05.769
I love you.

29:14.310 --> 29:16.321
I love you, too. [Sighs]

29:25.572 --> 29:28.783
You don't have to come to my
grandmother's funeral tomorrow.

29:28.784 --> 29:30.626
Oh, thank God.

29:31.870 --> 29:33.954
- Yeah.
- [sighs]

29:33.955 --> 29:36.582
[woman speaking indistinctly on PA]

29:36.583 --> 29:40.335
You ain't gonna get a gold
star for showin' up early.

29:40.336 --> 29:43.839
That guard, that [grunts] awful, awful man.

29:43.840 --> 29:45.174
Which one?

29:45.175 --> 29:48.719
That new guard. D-list Burt
Reynolds but more rapey.

29:48.720 --> 29:49.887
Pornstache.

29:49.888 --> 29:52.014
Yeah. He gave me extra work duty.

29:52.015 --> 29:54.349
He's punishing me for
believing in something.

29:54.350 --> 29:59.239
Well, people don't like conviction
around here. Okay? No, sir.

30:00.065 --> 30:01.649
Well, I'm gonna show them.

30:01.650 --> 30:03.901
Soon, no one will be
eating, and then they'll see.

30:03.902 --> 30:05.235
Why ain't we eating?

30:05.236 --> 30:08.197
[Brook] In protest of
the conditions in here.

30:08.198 --> 30:10.541
Well, that's just super stupid.

30:11.577 --> 30:15.913
And dumb. And mean and cruel and stupid.

30:15.914 --> 30:21.251
And, yeah, I said "stupid" twice,
only to emphasize how stupid that is.

30:21.252 --> 30:23.546
Hey, leave Mulan alone.

30:23.547 --> 30:26.424
It's Brook, actually. Soso.

30:26.425 --> 30:28.018
[Pennsatucky snorts]

30:28.760 --> 30:30.595
You know what? You're right, Soso.

30:30.596 --> 30:33.305
You know, look around this
place. We're criminals,

30:33.306 --> 30:36.016
but that don't mean we don't deserve
to be treated like normal people.

30:36.017 --> 30:37.527
Exactly.

30:38.437 --> 30:41.772
Since when do you care
about the conditions, Leanne?

30:41.773 --> 30:44.233
Since always.

30:44.234 --> 30:46.611
Nobody likes to live like an animal.

30:46.612 --> 30:50.114
So, you wanna join me?

30:50.115 --> 30:54.002
It depends on what they're serving
for lunch today, but I'll think on it.

30:55.120 --> 30:57.580
Okay. You know, I could tell you more about

30:57.581 --> 31:00.958
the efficacy of prison hunger
strikes historically, if you want.

31:00.959 --> 31:04.211
That sounds real interesting.

31:04.212 --> 31:09.309
Great. Lilo and Stitch starving
themselves to save the world. This is...

31:14.430 --> 31:15.774
She's Lilo, isn't she?

31:16.558 --> 31:19.735
So, you're saying that I'm
Stitch, you friendless freak?

31:20.937 --> 31:23.656
No one likes you.

31:24.983 --> 31:26.576
[grunts]

31:27.903 --> 31:29.537
[Leanne groans]

31:32.824 --> 31:35.210
[breathing heavily]

31:44.670 --> 31:49.674
Aw, are you guys lost? We
ain't ready for breakfast yet.

31:49.675 --> 31:53.969
But today, we have cream of
wheat. Yay. Old-people food.

31:53.970 --> 31:55.888
Didn't your mother teach you manners?

31:55.889 --> 31:58.974
Why you old people always
gotta be so cranky all the time?

31:58.975 --> 32:02.186
Yeah, you here to teach us
a morality lesson and shit?

32:02.187 --> 32:03.688
[inmates laughing]

32:03.689 --> 32:05.648
We're here to collect what belongs to Red.

32:05.649 --> 32:07.316
Well, we don't know
nothing about that, so...

32:07.317 --> 32:09.160
[inmates snickering]

32:09.861 --> 32:12.530
Aren't you cute?

32:12.531 --> 32:16.292
Did you get caught up in
your boyfriend's drug game?

32:16.993 --> 32:18.920
You wanna know what I did?

32:19.621 --> 32:25.167
Cut my husband's dick off with a
butcher knife, and it wasn't even sharp.

32:25.168 --> 32:27.127
I still dream about it,

32:27.128 --> 32:32.475
all the blood, the way it
flopped around in my fist.

32:34.385 --> 32:38.564
Hmm. Best thing I ever did. [Chuckles]

32:41.226 --> 32:45.571
[Irma] It's so disappointing
being underestimated as you age.

32:47.691 --> 32:50.109
I don't know what happened.
Nobody tells the new girl.

32:50.110 --> 32:52.778
One day, she was running
things, large and in charge.

32:52.779 --> 32:56.531
And the next, poof, gone. So long, Rhonda.

32:56.532 --> 33:00.410
Something major must've happened
for her to be sent down to max, no?

33:00.411 --> 33:03.748
Yeah, well, who knows how
stuff works around here?

33:03.749 --> 33:06.541
You hear Anita had a
heart attack last night?

33:06.542 --> 33:08.460
The guido who rooms with us?

33:08.461 --> 33:09.920
[scoffs]

33:09.921 --> 33:12.933
Probably too much ragù in her arteries.

33:13.759 --> 33:15.134
Speaking of...

33:15.135 --> 33:17.103
[man speaking indistinctly on PA]

33:23.434 --> 33:24.894
Put your hand in.

33:24.895 --> 33:26.937
Oh, God. That's unsanitary.

33:26.938 --> 33:29.157
Just do it.

33:31.276 --> 33:32.577
Pull.

33:36.156 --> 33:37.364
Holy shit.

33:37.365 --> 33:39.617
Not too bad for a white girl, hmm?

33:39.618 --> 33:44.288
[chuckles] Not too bad at
all. You selling already?

33:44.289 --> 33:47.457
A little. Here and
there. Testing the waters.

33:47.458 --> 33:49.760
I don't wanna get in over my head.

33:50.962 --> 33:55.132
Shit, you gonna be running things
around here in a few months.

33:55.133 --> 33:57.936
We'll see. Slow and steady.

33:59.095 --> 34:01.481
But I do thank you for your advice.

34:03.474 --> 34:08.395
Hey, Vee, I'm sorry to bother you,
but the one without the eyebrows,

34:08.396 --> 34:10.313
she ain't got her money.

34:10.315 --> 34:12.775
Figured you'd wanna deal
yourself like you told us.

34:12.775 --> 34:14.452
I'll be right there.

34:16.571 --> 34:19.623
I better get going. We can talk more later.

34:20.826 --> 34:22.210
I'm impressed, Red.

34:28.330 --> 34:29.833
[Dayanara] Red helped me with Mendez.

34:29.835 --> 34:31.960
Does the entire prison know?

34:31.962 --> 34:36.757
That's it. I promise.
Babe, you need to relax.

34:36.757 --> 34:39.217
How can you act like everything
is fine when he's back here?

34:39.219 --> 34:43.398
He could ruin our lives. He
could... He could ruin my life.

34:44.639 --> 34:45.975
[grunts]

34:45.976 --> 34:48.936
Everything's gonna be
fine. Red's on our side.

34:48.937 --> 34:50.645
And Mendez doesn't even try to talk to me.

34:50.646 --> 34:53.357
Good, I mean, I'm sure they
probably... [breathes heavily]

34:53.358 --> 34:56.150
I'm sure they probably told him
to stay as far away as possible.

34:56.152 --> 34:58.904
Just feels a little weird since, you
know, he's in love with me or whatever.

34:58.905 --> 35:01.531
You would think that he'd try to say hi.

35:01.532 --> 35:03.117
Okay, you know, I...

35:03.118 --> 35:05.298
I'm gonna tell Caputo
that Mendez is the father.

35:06.496 --> 35:08.122
But that's a lie.

35:08.123 --> 35:10.341
But didn't he have sex with you?

35:10.917 --> 35:12.752
- Yeah.
- Okay, so he's a criminal,

35:12.753 --> 35:14.544
he deserves to go to prison.

35:14.545 --> 35:17.256
But you have sex with me. Used to, anyways.

35:17.257 --> 35:19.884
That's different. I... I love you.

35:19.885 --> 35:21.176
So does he.

35:21.177 --> 35:23.387
Are you actually defending him right now?

35:23.388 --> 35:25.890
I just can't believe that you would
send an innocent man to prison.

35:25.891 --> 35:29.226
I'm sorry, what? The whole... The
whole plan was to send him to prison.

35:29.227 --> 35:31.353
I mean, that's why you fucked him
in the first place, was it not?

35:31.354 --> 35:33.239
It's just... It just didn't work.

35:34.065 --> 35:36.608
I don't know what I was
doing. They talked me into it.

35:36.609 --> 35:38.994
You know how scary my mom can be.

35:40.071 --> 35:42.656
But I've had time to
reflect, and he's innocent.

35:42.657 --> 35:46.118
Oh, come on, Daya, you know he
deserves to go to prison for something.

35:46.119 --> 35:48.370
- This is... This is just how life works.
- [sighs]

35:48.371 --> 35:50.497
Well, I need time to think.

35:50.498 --> 35:53.292
Don't you go doing nothing
without talking to me.

35:53.293 --> 35:54.594
You hear me?

35:55.670 --> 35:58.181
Now, you want me to finish or what?

35:59.632 --> 36:00.715
Yes.

36:00.716 --> 36:02.935
- [clicking tongue]
- [Leanne clears throat]

36:03.929 --> 36:05.554
Red light special, please.

36:05.555 --> 36:09.433
[sighs] Man, you people are
like a 3D "Don't do drugs" ad.

36:09.434 --> 36:10.818
Ain't that the code?

36:12.854 --> 36:14.554
[Poussey] Damn, you want that many?

36:15.106 --> 36:16.866
Isn't that what it costs?

36:17.608 --> 36:18.692
What are you talkin' about?

36:18.693 --> 36:20.235
The stuff.

36:20.236 --> 36:21.695
You can say, "cigarette."

36:21.696 --> 36:26.241
What? [Sighs] No. The special stuff.
I know the black girls are selling it.

36:26.242 --> 36:27.910
You saying we all look alike?

36:27.911 --> 36:31.705
Come on, my face is all achy. I
need to not feel it for a while.

36:31.706 --> 36:35.835
Then go buy some aspirin from
commissary. Get out of here.

36:35.836 --> 36:37.803
And I'm keeping these for my time.

36:38.797 --> 36:40.464
[sighs]

36:40.465 --> 36:41.766
Go.

36:42.843 --> 36:44.352
[sighs]

36:46.888 --> 36:51.058
This one Christmas, I was
allowed to help Grandmother

36:51.059 --> 36:55.312
make her really famous sugar
cookies for the very first time.

36:55.313 --> 36:59.483
I think most of you have probably received
a tin of her cookies over the years.

36:59.484 --> 37:01.704
[Cal] If you didn't,
Grandmother didn't like you.

37:02.778 --> 37:03.988
I'm just sayin'.

37:03.989 --> 37:08.826
Anyway, it took less than
five minutes for me to mess up,

37:08.827 --> 37:11.829
and I poured too much
baking soda into the dough

37:11.830 --> 37:14.081
and I immediately started crying.

37:14.082 --> 37:18.636
I thought I had completely
ruined Christmas.

37:19.504 --> 37:21.681
But instead of yelling at me,

37:22.673 --> 37:25.509
Grandmother told me that
they were gonna be fine,

37:25.510 --> 37:28.604
and she said better, even. And then...

37:30.640 --> 37:36.862
And then she said to me, "Piper,
life is made in the mistakes."

37:40.233 --> 37:43.994
In retrospect, I'm sure she
remade them after I left, you know?

37:46.364 --> 37:47.489
I'm sorry.

37:47.490 --> 37:49.033
It's okay. It's okay.

37:49.034 --> 37:50.418
Um...

37:51.702 --> 37:56.040
I mean, the woman's name
was Celeste, for God's sake.

37:56.041 --> 37:58.708
Uh, sorry. Sorry. Sorry, Father.

37:58.709 --> 38:02.337
Um, I don't know if any of you have ever
heard one of those things played before.

38:02.338 --> 38:08.878
A celeste, I mean, but it is
this magical, ethereal experience.

38:09.179 --> 38:13.399
All these steel plates that ting
and sound like, I don't know, like,

38:14.100 --> 38:18.112
if an ocean were to suddenly make music.

38:18.563 --> 38:21.982
Um... That's... That's not
really like Grandmother,

38:21.983 --> 38:24.068
but she was, she was special.

38:24.069 --> 38:26.486
She... She made you feel like there
was something important about you

38:26.487 --> 38:32.377
even when you knew you were nothing but
a polyp in the sea of human mundanity.

38:33.536 --> 38:36.881
Lot of ocean imagery here. But look,

38:37.623 --> 38:40.709
the point is that Grandmother
was a wonderful woman.

38:40.710 --> 38:44.046
That's the point I'm trying to
make. And she should be celebrated.

38:44.047 --> 38:48.133
And my sister, Piper, is here,
and that is truly incredible

38:48.134 --> 38:51.886
because she is technically a
ward of the federal government.

38:51.887 --> 38:57.026
Or... just returned
from Africa, Aunt Kathy.

38:57.268 --> 39:01.105
Um... Either way, today
is a day to celebrate life.

39:01.106 --> 39:04.742
Today is a day to celebrate today.

39:05.901 --> 39:07.202
And that is why...

39:10.031 --> 39:12.958
that is why I can't think
of a better time to do this.

39:15.370 --> 39:18.788
Come on. Come on, my
little hen of the woods.

39:18.789 --> 39:19.914
[Neri giggling]

39:19.915 --> 39:22.385
- [woman] Who is she?
- [Cal] Aah!

39:23.086 --> 39:26.796
[chuckles] Friends, family...

39:26.797 --> 39:28.798
- Do something.
- ... lovers,

39:28.799 --> 39:31.426
older family friends that I
can never remember the names of,

39:31.427 --> 39:33.979
Neri and I are getting married...

39:35.140 --> 39:36.223
right now...

39:36.224 --> 39:37.682
[people gasping]

39:37.683 --> 39:39.893
with all of you as our witnesses.

39:39.894 --> 39:42.687
Our friends are here, Piper's on furlough,

39:42.688 --> 39:46.025
our buddy, Sam, got ordained
last week just for us.

39:46.026 --> 39:47.985
Thank you, Sam.

39:47.986 --> 39:49.653
Neri's family is here.

39:49.654 --> 39:50.737
- We're here!
- Hi.

39:50.738 --> 39:53.490
Pam and Joe in the back. Hi, guys.
You're so cute. You are awesome.

39:53.491 --> 39:56.118
Thank you for coming. Love you. And...

39:56.119 --> 39:57.494
[Joe] So happy to be here.

39:57.495 --> 40:00.506
I think that Celeste...

40:01.541 --> 40:06.170
would be pleased with our judicious
use of the free flowers and food,

40:06.171 --> 40:08.547
if not a tiny bit judgmental.

40:08.548 --> 40:11.883
And I think that she would
admire our spirit, right?

40:11.884 --> 40:14.729
- [giggles]
- Ah. [Moans]

40:15.555 --> 40:17.147
Pipes.

40:20.018 --> 40:22.019
We're gonna eat the world.

40:22.020 --> 40:24.113
[people cheering]

40:29.027 --> 40:30.328
Sorry, Mom.

40:34.574 --> 40:37.292
[man speaking indistinctly on PA]

40:39.954 --> 40:42.331
- Yo.
- Yo, what the hell are you doin'?

40:42.332 --> 40:45.542
I need to talk to you. I
think Vee's bringin' in drugs.

40:45.543 --> 40:49.504
P, ain't you bored of havin' the
same damn conversation every day?

40:49.505 --> 40:50.880
Shit, I know I am.

40:50.881 --> 40:52.966
Yo, just listen, all right?
One of them meth heads...

40:52.967 --> 40:56.928
No! Why don't you listen
and stop running your mouth?

40:56.929 --> 41:01.015
Who cares what she's
doing? That's her business.

41:01.016 --> 41:06.480
She's been real good to me, and I
am not about to turn away from that.

41:06.481 --> 41:08.408
Vee is my family.

41:09.400 --> 41:10.609
Thought I was your family.

41:10.610 --> 41:13.237
You both are my family, yo, like...

41:13.238 --> 41:14.513
What if we was...

41:14.514 --> 41:16.299
What if we was drownin'
in the middle of the ocean,

41:16.300 --> 41:18.408
and you could only save one of us?

41:18.409 --> 41:19.534
Why can't I save both of you?

41:19.535 --> 41:20.921
I don't know. Because you can't.

41:20.922 --> 41:22.596
'Cause there's not enough room in the boat.

41:22.597 --> 41:24.581
It's, like, the world's
tiniest boat or some shit?

41:24.582 --> 41:25.957
Yes, okay? Yes.

41:25.958 --> 41:28.710
It's like a little raft for
kiddies and shit, all right?

41:28.711 --> 41:31.546
- Can you just play the game with me?
- Listen up, pussy.

41:31.547 --> 41:35.925
I love you, but I am done as a
burnt burger talkin' about this shit.

41:35.926 --> 41:39.596
No more talkin' about
Vee to me or to anyone.

41:39.597 --> 41:43.233
And, P, that woman don't play around.

41:44.810 --> 41:46.361
Don't get in her way.

41:47.105 --> 41:49.615
Or mine. You hear?

41:50.775 --> 41:52.076
Yeah.

41:58.449 --> 42:00.117
What happened, Doggett? [Sighs]

42:00.118 --> 42:02.753
You know I get mad sometimes.

42:04.289 --> 42:07.257
I know I've been a bully. I know.

42:10.085 --> 42:13.222
But I was really trying to turn a new leaf.

42:18.969 --> 42:22.139
[sobbing] Please...

42:22.140 --> 42:25.642
Please don't send me down
to SHU, Mr. Healy, please.

42:25.643 --> 42:29.363
It is truly awful down there.

42:32.650 --> 42:36.496
Doggett, have you always
been quick to anger?

42:37.447 --> 42:38.655
What you mean?

42:38.656 --> 42:43.076
I mean, does it sit
right below the surface?

42:43.077 --> 42:46.830
Does it bubble up and surprise
you when you're not expecting it?

42:46.831 --> 42:49.833
Do you have a pounding right here?

42:49.834 --> 42:51.668
Like, feels like a vein's gonna explode?

42:51.669 --> 42:53.012
Yeah.

42:53.713 --> 42:55.672
Are you a psychic or something?

42:55.673 --> 42:56.756
No.

42:56.757 --> 43:00.009
How are you in my head, then, right now?

43:00.010 --> 43:03.022
Because I've had anger issues of my own...

43:04.390 --> 43:08.736
and what I've found is that a change of
perspective can make all the difference.

43:10.104 --> 43:13.523
Do you mean, like, looking left
rather than right kind of thing?

43:13.524 --> 43:15.409
Exactly like that.

43:16.361 --> 43:18.788
Instead of me sending you down to SHU,

43:19.822 --> 43:22.949
I want you to come and
visit me once a week.

43:22.950 --> 43:24.627
What would we do?

43:28.038 --> 43:29.590
Talk.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.501
What will we talk about?

43:32.502 --> 43:35.837
I could counsel you through
some of these issues.

43:35.838 --> 43:38.891
Yes, thank you. Yes.

43:40.426 --> 43:42.802
That's so awfully nice of you, Mr. Healy.

43:42.803 --> 43:46.273
I'm a nice guy. That's the truth.

43:52.730 --> 43:54.022
Maybe they're runnin' late.

43:54.023 --> 43:56.816
Nah, it's a prison. They
didn't get lost in the moment.

43:56.817 --> 43:58.568
- [Nicky] ...take whatever.
- Hey.

43:58.569 --> 44:02.239
No, I mean, Jesus, why you
fucking breaking my balls?

44:02.240 --> 44:06.743
Man, this took way more convincing than
two boxes of oatmeal pies are worth.

44:06.744 --> 44:11.831
Please, sit. I thought we could
enjoy a family meal together.

44:11.832 --> 44:13.124
You made this?

44:13.125 --> 44:14.709
How the fuck you do this without a kitchen?

44:14.710 --> 44:16.253
I'm a good improviser.

44:16.254 --> 44:19.088
And I had some help from
the baddest bitches around.

44:19.089 --> 44:20.924
- [inmates laugh]
- It smells wonderful, Red.

44:20.925 --> 44:22.050
Doesn't mean it tastes good.

44:22.051 --> 44:25.595
Ooh! Daddy's getting blotto tonight, huh?

44:25.596 --> 44:27.064
[inmates chuckle]

44:30.435 --> 44:32.686
Thank you for coming. I
know you didn't have to.

44:32.687 --> 44:36.022
Hey, Red. Got to let us in on the
secret. I mean, this shit is crazy.

44:36.023 --> 44:38.442
You're my family.

44:38.443 --> 44:40.535
All of you are very important to me.

44:41.362 --> 44:46.115
And I... let a lot of things get in
the way of that these past few months.

44:46.116 --> 44:47.784
- I truly...
- [Big Boo] Hey!

44:47.785 --> 44:51.788
Golden oldies. How about I get
some of that slop down here, huh?

44:51.789 --> 44:54.759
- Seriously. Food me.
- [Nicky] Yeah.

44:55.209 --> 44:57.293
- Ow!
- I'm trying to have a moment.

44:57.294 --> 44:59.138
Now shut up and eat.

45:03.718 --> 45:05.144
Thank you.

45:06.679 --> 45:08.272
As I was saying,

45:09.181 --> 45:12.609
I realize I never said
the most important thing...

45:16.939 --> 45:19.574
I'm sorry.

45:22.952 --> 45:24.696
You know, Red, we've done okay without you.

45:24.697 --> 45:28.241
I know you have, but I want
you to do better than okay.

45:28.242 --> 45:31.620
Yeah, but maybe there are some
parts that we didn't miss so much.

45:31.621 --> 45:33.497
Like being pushed around.

45:33.498 --> 45:34.799
Or burned.

45:35.875 --> 45:39.711
Gina, I don't know that
I'll ever have the words

45:39.712 --> 45:42.597
to express the regret I feel
for what happened to you.

45:44.967 --> 45:46.643
I made a mistake.

45:47.428 --> 45:50.480
I hope you accept my apology.

45:55.853 --> 45:57.154
Okay.

45:58.606 --> 46:02.692
I'm willing to make this more of a
democracy, if that's what you all want.

46:02.693 --> 46:04.870
I just want my family back.

46:05.571 --> 46:08.165
Oh, get over here, Red.

46:09.742 --> 46:11.034
Right?

46:11.035 --> 46:12.160
[chuckles]

46:12.161 --> 46:15.414
Norma. My dear Norma,

46:15.415 --> 46:19.208
you've been by my side for many years.

46:19.209 --> 46:22.253
You stood beside me, listened to me,

46:22.254 --> 46:25.840
plucked the hair out of that
weird mole on the back of my arm.

46:25.841 --> 46:27.008
[inmates chuckle]

46:27.009 --> 46:31.856
You're my best friend,
and I miss you so much.

46:38.563 --> 46:42.190
Thank you for giving me another chance.

46:42.191 --> 46:43.608
What about me?

46:43.609 --> 46:47.153
Don't you have a special dedication for me?

46:47.154 --> 46:51.950
Boo, thank you, for always
being a pain in my ass.

46:51.951 --> 46:55.369
- [inmates laugh]
- Let's stick together from now on, huh?

46:55.370 --> 46:58.548
[all toasting in Russian]

47:01.293 --> 47:02.803
Uh-huh.

47:04.338 --> 47:05.680
Ah.

47:10.845 --> 47:12.396
[grunts]

47:14.056 --> 47:16.390
What do you want?

47:16.391 --> 47:19.519
Hear you have a pretty good system
worked out for yourself in here.

47:19.520 --> 47:24.273
Norma... get the nice young woman a form.

47:24.274 --> 47:27.151
Write down what you
want, and I'll do my best.

47:27.152 --> 47:30.747
We're a little overwhelmed
with orders lately, though.

47:31.782 --> 47:35.377
I ain't here to place no
orders. Here to buy the company.

47:36.370 --> 47:38.454
It's not for sale, sorry.

47:38.455 --> 47:40.507
You don't even wanna hear the offer?

47:41.250 --> 47:42.416
Try me.

47:42.417 --> 47:46.546
You get to stay in cozy minimum security.

47:46.547 --> 47:48.765
Oh, and we don't break your ribs.

47:50.050 --> 47:56.565
You, my dear, have chosen the one
fight in here that can't be won.

47:57.767 --> 48:00.268
Go run to your mommy,

48:00.269 --> 48:05.649
tell her Red needs to talk to her,
then the adults will discuss this.

48:05.650 --> 48:09.068
You know that's a real stupid move, right?

48:09.069 --> 48:11.788
I mean, I'm happy to go get her for you.

48:13.032 --> 48:15.825
Today has been kind of boring, anyhow.

48:15.826 --> 48:19.004
Go. Go, go, go.

48:26.461 --> 48:28.171
I'm sorry. Maybe I'm just an idiot.

48:28.172 --> 48:30.674
'Cause I'm having a hard
motherfucking time understanding

48:30.675 --> 48:33.677
how three little old ladies
come in here and stole from us.

48:33.678 --> 48:35.261
They was really scary.

48:35.262 --> 48:38.107
Yeah, and one of 'em
looked like a Disney witch.

48:38.515 --> 48:40.391
[exclaims in Spanish]

48:40.392 --> 48:42.686
You know what? Go!
Get... Get out of my face.

48:42.687 --> 48:44.029
Yo.

48:45.690 --> 48:47.908
Red sends her apologies.

48:53.197 --> 48:55.040
I hate this kitchen.

48:55.908 --> 48:59.211
[woman speaking indistinctly
on walkie-talkie]

49:11.882 --> 49:14.894
What the fuck is this? Huh?

49:15.720 --> 49:17.187
What is this?

49:17.579 --> 49:19.764
You think you can just get
away with this shit in here?

49:19.765 --> 49:23.485
You think I'm gonna turn a
blind eye? Think I'm a pussy?

49:24.854 --> 49:27.531
It's time for a good
old-fashioned search, ladies.

49:37.241 --> 49:39.543
Oh, what is this?

49:40.452 --> 49:42.504
Illegal contraband?

49:43.873 --> 49:46.290
You're awfully quiet, inmate.
Got nothing to say now?

49:46.291 --> 49:50.419
You scared? 'Cause you fucking should be!

49:50.420 --> 49:54.308
I'm in control! I'm in charge!

50:05.310 --> 50:07.603
- Fuckin'...
- Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Buddy!

50:07.604 --> 50:09.573
Ssh! Ssh! Ssh! Ssh!

50:11.066 --> 50:13.359
We are gonna fucking crack
down on you! On all of you!

50:13.360 --> 50:16.362
Hey! [Softly] You're gonna
get yourself fired, pal.

50:16.363 --> 50:18.156
[Pornstache shushing]

50:18.157 --> 50:20.960
It's okay. Come on.

50:21.952 --> 50:25.538
You all right? Come on.
Let's get you out of here.

50:25.539 --> 50:30.635
Everything's okay, ladies. Just
clean this shit up, all right?

50:32.087 --> 50:33.930
[breathing heavily]

50:46.060 --> 50:49.228
Sorry for the fuss. Come on.

50:49.229 --> 50:50.313
[Bennett whimpering]

50:50.314 --> 50:52.616
[Pornstache] You're all
right, buddy. Come on.

50:55.610 --> 50:57.371
[door closes]

50:58.363 --> 51:02.867
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
for the very first time,

51:02.868 --> 51:05.161
the bride and the groom.

51:05.162 --> 51:06.996
[indistinct talking and laughter]

51:06.997 --> 51:09.799
It's so wonderful that
you could be here, Piper.

51:10.835 --> 51:12.677
[Gene] How are you doing?

51:14.254 --> 51:17.298
Fine. I'm fine.

51:17.299 --> 51:22.095
We would be so heartbroken for our
Julie if she were in your position.

51:22.096 --> 51:25.223
[Louise] You know what, we
were just talking earlier

51:25.224 --> 51:27.892
about what a wonderful kid you were.

51:27.893 --> 51:32.864
Always in the newspaper for
something and always achieving.

51:33.733 --> 51:37.651
We just want you to know, dear,
we still see you as that person.

51:37.652 --> 51:41.915
[Gene] I'm sure you're anxious
to return to your old self.

51:45.452 --> 51:47.296
[Neri laughing]

51:53.043 --> 51:55.054
I'm not, actually.

53:34.979 --> 53:37.656
[woman speaking indistinctly on PA]

53:38.440 --> 53:39.741
[Big Boo] Well, now.

53:40.650 --> 53:43.611
There's the black beauty
I've been waitin' for.

53:43.612 --> 53:45.154
[Vee] Can I help you?

53:45.155 --> 53:47.823
I think that's the
other way around, sistah.

53:47.824 --> 53:51.452
Jesus. Can't even brush your teeth around
here without getting into something.

53:51.453 --> 53:52.745
What do you want, man?

53:52.746 --> 53:57.634
How much would it be worth to
you to find another route in?

53:59.419 --> 54:01.045
Depends on where the route goes.

54:01.046 --> 54:05.008
Oh, now, you know I
can't give you information

54:05.009 --> 54:06.969
unless I know what I'm getting for it.

54:06.970 --> 54:08.103
[spits]

54:08.929 --> 54:11.481
And I'm supposed to be interested in that?

54:13.642 --> 54:16.936
I know how Red's importing contraband.

54:16.937 --> 54:18.897
Interested in that?

54:18.898 --> 54:22.984
'Cause I also know that the
guards are hot on your trail.

54:22.985 --> 54:25.861
So you're gonna need a new cover, right?

54:25.862 --> 54:28.540
I want 20% of tobacco intake.

54:29.283 --> 54:31.492
[both laughing]

54:31.493 --> 54:33.827
You are a smug little dyke, aren't you?

54:33.828 --> 54:38.582
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I am a big, smart dyke.

54:38.583 --> 54:40.969
Yes, ma'am.

54:43.213 --> 54:44.681
10%.

54:46.883 --> 54:48.727
Got yourself a deal.

54:49.428 --> 54:50.729
[spits]

54:55.809 --> 54:57.527
[whispering]

54:58.478 --> 55:01.197
[man speaking indistinctly on PA]

55:02.732 --> 55:06.069
Did you get your pack of
wild dogs under control?

55:06.070 --> 55:07.403
They're always obedient.

55:07.404 --> 55:12.542
Good. Then I'll look forward to
never seeing them in here again.

55:15.079 --> 55:17.547
Who do you think gave the order, Red?

55:20.167 --> 55:21.250
You're my friend.

55:21.251 --> 55:24.763
I don't remember us
exchanging woven bracelets.

55:26.881 --> 55:30.969
You're not taking over
my business. I started it.

55:30.970 --> 55:33.929
Come on. Can't we share?

55:33.930 --> 55:36.474
Didn't I give you the
idea in the first place?

55:36.475 --> 55:37.850
Now all of a sudden, it's yours?

55:37.851 --> 55:39.903
What did you do to Rhonda?

55:41.771 --> 55:43.772
Here's what's gonna happen.

55:43.773 --> 55:46.034
You're gonna keep taking
orders and filling them.

55:46.901 --> 55:52.281
My girls will be distributing the
goods and collecting the payments.

55:52.282 --> 55:54.117
I'll tell Healy.

55:54.118 --> 55:56.002
Oh, Red.

55:56.953 --> 55:59.663
[sighs] You do that,

55:59.664 --> 56:04.303
and I will make sure that you
end up exactly like Rhonda.

56:05.129 --> 56:08.797
You are not taking this from me.

56:08.798 --> 56:12.311
Your first mistake is not having backup.

56:14.554 --> 56:16.440
Oh!

56:20.227 --> 56:22.020
Go ahead.

56:22.021 --> 56:23.822
[Red groaning]

56:38.537 --> 56:40.505
[Red continues groaning]

56:52.176 --> 56:53.893
[whimpering]

56:55.011 --> 56:56.521
[Red sobbing]

56:58.515 --> 57:00.149
[shushing]

57:09.025 --> 57:12.111
Hey, I got a gift for you.

57:12.112 --> 57:14.414
Shit, it's not even my birthday.

57:15.532 --> 57:18.502
First one's free. Let
me know if you want more.

57:24.499 --> 57:26.217
[Nicky chuckles]

57:32.049 --> 57:36.844
When I said prove it, I meant
it in a Coach Taylor kind of way.

57:36.845 --> 57:41.307
Not a "terrify all the inmates,
get yourself suspended" way.

57:41.308 --> 57:44.977
Sorry, sir. I don't know what...
I don't know what got into me.

57:44.978 --> 57:46.687
I don't have time for any more headaches

57:46.688 --> 57:49.022
on top of everything
else right now, Bennett.

57:49.023 --> 57:52.526
I understand. I'm just...
just under a lot of stress

57:52.527 --> 57:55.038
with the shot quota and some, uh...

57:56.073 --> 57:57.740
some personal stuff.

57:57.741 --> 58:01.660
Yes, and your personal crap belongs
at home next to your tchotchkes.

58:01.661 --> 58:06.090
Well, that's the thing, sir, I...
can't exactly leave this stuff at home.

58:07.251 --> 58:09.135
What are you trying to tell me?

58:12.589 --> 58:16.726
Diaz is pregnant. Dayanara.

58:18.011 --> 58:19.353
What?

58:22.932 --> 58:24.693
Must've been Mendez.

58:31.024 --> 58:32.992
