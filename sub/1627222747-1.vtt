00:29.495 --> 00:30.496
<i>Can you stay with me?</i>

00:30.528 --> 00:31.597
<i>Please?</i>

00:31.629 --> 00:33.465
<i>I need a sunset shot
for the end of the movie.</i>

00:35.601 --> 00:37.970
Ok. Show me this
new fancy camera

00:38.003 --> 00:40.139
your parents spent way
too much money on.

00:40.171 --> 00:42.007
You won't regret it.

00:44.876 --> 00:46.879
Look at that picture.

00:46.912 --> 00:48.915
It's perfect, mom.

00:50.949 --> 00:52.751
I can't wait to show dad.

01:59.952 --> 02:01.086
Excuse me, but-

02:10.761 --> 02:13.098
Not exactly JFK, huh?

02:15.868 --> 02:17.803
Your grandfather said
he'd be here.

02:17.836 --> 02:20.505
I wonder where he is.

02:20.539 --> 02:22.542
Are you getting a signal?

02:32.850 --> 02:33.785
Hey!

02:33.819 --> 02:35.455
Kangaroo!

02:38.290 --> 02:40.025
Made you look.

02:45.230 --> 02:46.732
<i>Why are we even here?</i>

02:46.765 --> 02:49.601
We're here to spend time
with your grandfather.

02:49.635 --> 02:51.070
I've never even met this guy.

02:51.102 --> 02:53.171
We're moving in
with a total stranger.

03:17.261 --> 03:19.864
That's Dad's dad?

03:19.898 --> 03:21.968
I don't know who that is.

03:27.939 --> 03:30.041
You must be Gloria.

03:30.075 --> 03:31.543
I'm Jules.

03:31.576 --> 03:34.078
Spencer sent me to fetch ya.

03:34.112 --> 03:37.082
Nice to meet you.

03:37.114 --> 03:39.751
You must be Ridley.

03:39.785 --> 03:40.853
How're ya goin', mate?

03:40.886 --> 03:42.588
Hey.

03:43.355 --> 03:44.991
I'll grab the bags.

03:46.190 --> 03:48.560
I'm sorry to hear
about Bryce.

03:48.594 --> 03:49.929
You knew my husband?

03:49.962 --> 03:51.030
Of course.

03:51.063 --> 03:53.732
We were mates from school.

03:53.765 --> 03:55.968
I used to fight him
for his lunch money.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.003
Never got it, though.

03:58.035 --> 04:00.271
I'm surprised he never
mentioned me.

04:00.304 --> 04:01.505
No, sorry.

04:01.540 --> 04:05.911
He uh, he talked a lot about his
mom and someone named Julie?

04:05.944 --> 04:06.879
Ha.

04:06.911 --> 04:08.914
The bugger.

04:08.946 --> 04:10.214
That's me.

04:10.248 --> 04:11.850
Julie.

04:11.882 --> 04:14.587
I hated being called that.

04:14.619 --> 04:16.887
It made Bryce happy.

04:16.922 --> 04:18.791
He'll be missed.

04:20.190 --> 04:22.194
You must be proud
of your dad, mate.

04:22.227 --> 04:24.129
I heard he saved seven people.

04:24.162 --> 04:25.263
Three.

04:25.297 --> 04:26.198
What?

04:26.230 --> 04:27.766
He saved three people.

04:27.799 --> 04:30.102
Still, not bad, hey?

04:30.134 --> 04:31.202
Yeah, no.

04:31.235 --> 04:33.605
Totally worth it.

04:35.273 --> 04:37.309
Well, let's hit the track, hey?

04:45.249 --> 04:48.187
<i>Is all of this
Spencer's land?</i>

04:48.220 --> 04:50.922
As far as the eye can see.

05:52.384 --> 05:53.653
Woah!

05:55.252 --> 05:56.788
Are you ok, honey?

06:06.398 --> 06:07.398
<i>Spencer?</i>

06:07.432 --> 06:09.068
So they tell me.

06:12.470 --> 06:15.107
It's very nice to uh, finally
meet you in person, Gloria.

06:15.139 --> 06:17.742
Welcome to Buckley's Chance.

06:18.143 --> 06:20.145
Goats scare ya?

06:20.177 --> 06:21.713
I was not scared.

06:21.747 --> 06:24.215
Good day, Ridley.
How're ya goin'?

06:24.249 --> 06:27.453
Hi, uh, grandpa.

06:27.485 --> 06:30.122
Spencer. Call me Spencer.

06:30.155 --> 06:33.059
The dingo got in under
the fence again.

06:34.326 --> 06:36.128
They steal the eggs
and spook the hens.

06:36.160 --> 06:37.463
They're a bloody nuisance.

06:37.496 --> 06:39.098
Are they dangerous?

06:39.131 --> 06:42.201
If you see any around here,
tell us.

06:42.234 --> 06:45.370
The only place they belong
is deep in the outback.

06:45.403 --> 06:47.239
Or deep in the ground.

06:47.271 --> 06:49.373
Well, this is lovely.

06:49.407 --> 06:51.877
I reckon it could use
a woman's touch.

06:51.910 --> 06:54.246
Take the bags in,
you Galah.

06:55.112 --> 06:57.281
Touchy, touchy.

06:57.314 --> 07:01.819
So does everyone out here
run a sheep farm?

07:01.852 --> 07:03.788
No.

07:03.821 --> 07:06.292
Come on, let's show
Riddles his room.

07:09.895 --> 07:11.731
Riddles?

07:31.115 --> 07:32.283
Hey, Ridley, look.

07:32.316 --> 07:34.987
It's your dad playing rugby.

07:35.020 --> 07:36.955
Yeah, cool.

07:36.987 --> 07:40.191
Bryce never told me
he played.

07:40.225 --> 07:41.426
Was he good?

07:41.458 --> 07:43.161
Good?

07:43.194 --> 07:45.062
He was better than good.

07:45.095 --> 07:46.999
Aye, Spence?

07:49.400 --> 07:51.436
He was the best player to ever
come out of these parts,

07:51.468 --> 07:52.537
that's for sure.

07:52.571 --> 07:53.672
Maybe you should focus
on unloading

07:53.706 --> 07:58.376
the rest of the bags and spare
us the sports review.

08:01.612 --> 08:02.713
When you've done that,

08:02.747 --> 08:05.316
get some of the boys to double
check the south lines.

08:05.350 --> 08:06.852
I'm pretty sure I saw
a pack of them

08:06.884 --> 08:09.187
digging and tearing up
the fence.

08:09.220 --> 08:10.889
Right-o.

08:14.059 --> 08:15.795
Ok.

08:24.302 --> 08:26.104
Not bad, huh?

08:26.136 --> 08:29.208
This place is bigger than
our whole apartment.

08:34.913 --> 08:36.048
When you're ready, Riddles,

08:36.080 --> 08:37.948
we'll take a look around
the place.

08:37.982 --> 08:39.482
It's Ridley.

08:39.515 --> 08:41.318
What?

08:41.352 --> 08:44.423
Can you call me Ridley?

08:44.455 --> 08:46.490
Right then.

08:46.524 --> 08:47.993
I'll let you two get settled.

08:48.025 --> 08:49.828
You're next door.

08:52.963 --> 08:54.933
Would it kill you to be nice?

08:54.966 --> 08:56.501
Would it kill him to say
my name right?

08:56.534 --> 08:57.870
It's cute.

08:57.902 --> 08:59.872
He wants to give you
a nickname.

08:59.905 --> 09:02.207
I think it's an
Australian thing.

09:02.240 --> 09:06.311
Hey, at least be polite.

09:06.343 --> 09:08.446
Is it too early to say
I hate it here?

09:08.479 --> 09:10.481
Yes.

09:10.515 --> 09:12.951
What option do we have?

09:12.983 --> 09:15.586
How about leaving and going
back to New York?

09:15.620 --> 09:16.989
No.

09:17.021 --> 09:19.257
We tried it your way, remember?

09:25.195 --> 09:27.231
It's funny, this is
the last place

09:27.265 --> 09:31.604
your dad would ever have
expected us to end up.

10:19.383 --> 10:21.152
Oy, Riddles.

10:21.185 --> 10:21.987
Come on.

10:22.020 --> 10:24.290
Come and have a look around,
mate.

10:27.592 --> 10:29.461
It's Ridley.

10:33.464 --> 10:36.000
Hey, Riddles.

10:36.034 --> 10:38.102
Climb up the ladder.

10:38.136 --> 10:39.570
Go on.

10:39.603 --> 10:41.540
You're not scared of heights,
are ya?

10:41.573 --> 10:43.007
No.

10:52.483 --> 10:53.651
Oy.

10:59.357 --> 11:00.559
Eh?

11:02.160 --> 11:05.463
Check out that cheeky fella.

11:07.799 --> 11:11.169
I'm surprised not to see
his pack nearby.

11:11.202 --> 11:15.073
Dingos run in packs
for the most part.

11:15.106 --> 11:17.009
They play together,
hunt together,

11:17.041 --> 11:19.043
stay safe together.

11:19.077 --> 11:22.047
One big happy family.

11:22.079 --> 11:27.352
But sometimes one of the
young ones gets kicked out

11:27.385 --> 11:32.090
or wants to go out on his own
for whatever reason.

11:32.122 --> 11:35.059
So what will happen to him?

11:35.093 --> 11:42.199
Probably get killed, either
by a hunter, a farmer.

11:42.232 --> 11:45.170
A few make it
on their own.

11:45.203 --> 11:52.377
But sometimes they find their
own way back to their pack.

11:54.578 --> 11:57.516
Hey, look over there.

12:00.551 --> 12:03.654
That's where you're gonna
go to school.

12:03.688 --> 12:05.557
Budgie's Knob.

12:08.693 --> 12:10.295
Hey, don't look at me, mate.

12:10.328 --> 12:12.831
White fellas named that.

12:12.863 --> 12:17.234
So how am I supposed to get
to Budgie's Knob every day?

12:17.267 --> 12:19.103
School bus.

12:19.136 --> 12:22.574
If old Barney hasn't put it
into a ditch.

12:22.607 --> 12:26.111
Or you can ride
the four wheeler.

12:26.444 --> 12:28.713
Go on, hop on.

12:28.746 --> 12:30.381
Ok.

12:30.415 --> 12:32.184
Here.

12:32.217 --> 12:34.785
Keep that in a safe place.

12:34.819 --> 12:38.457
Ok, there's your brakes
on both sides.

12:38.490 --> 12:41.460
That lever down there
is your gears.

12:41.492 --> 12:43.661
You'll lift it up, ok?

12:43.694 --> 12:45.396
There's your start button
on the left.

12:46.430 --> 12:48.300
When you wanna take off...

12:52.536 --> 12:54.238
That's the throttle.

13:10.655 --> 13:11.790
Jules!

13:11.823 --> 13:15.593
Ridley needs a helmet if
he's gonna ride one of those.

13:17.594 --> 13:19.363
Helmet!

13:35.914 --> 13:38.650
Isn't it dangerous out there?

13:40.952 --> 13:42.654
Very.

14:17.789 --> 14:19.958
Shouldn't Ridley be back
by now?

14:19.991 --> 14:22.294
He's probably having
too much fun.

14:22.327 --> 14:23.761
Spencer,
Ridley's from the city.

14:23.795 --> 14:26.198
He doesn't know
what's out there.

14:26.231 --> 14:29.634
Well, now's his chance
to find out.

14:29.666 --> 14:31.235
Are you gonna go look
for him?

14:31.269 --> 14:33.272
Or do I have to?

14:43.814 --> 14:46.285
Hit the trench, did ya?

14:47.684 --> 14:51.256
Were you not looking
at the road?

14:51.789 --> 14:54.726
Were you looking in the camera
when you were driving?

14:56.526 --> 14:59.497
Yeah, well that was
bloody stupid.

14:59.530 --> 15:02.434
Give me a hand turning it over,
will ya?

15:06.971 --> 15:08.674
There you go.

15:15.913 --> 15:17.549
See? It's fine.

15:17.582 --> 15:19.684
Follow me back to the house.

15:19.717 --> 15:21.987
And if I see your face
in a camera

15:22.020 --> 15:24.923
I'll toss it in a billabong!

15:24.955 --> 15:28.926
Yeah, well, I don't even know
what a billabong is!

15:39.404 --> 15:41.606
So, can we make a deal?

15:41.639 --> 15:45.644
No more wild AVT rides?

15:45.676 --> 15:47.678
It's ATV.

15:47.712 --> 15:48.580
Whatever.

15:48.612 --> 15:52.550
No more Mad Max-ing around
the outback.

15:52.583 --> 15:56.420
Yeah, well, I don't think I'm
allowed to drive them anymore.

15:56.453 --> 15:59.357
Did Spencer say that?

15:59.390 --> 16:00.357
Yeah.

16:00.391 --> 16:03.461
He said I need to learn
to be responsible first.

16:03.493 --> 16:05.429
Whatever that means.

16:05.463 --> 16:08.033
He's just worried about you.

16:08.400 --> 16:09.567
That's a lie.

16:09.601 --> 16:12.971
He's more worried about his
stupid ATVs getting broken.

16:13.003 --> 16:14.071
He's a jerk.

16:14.104 --> 16:16.974
<i>He is not a jerk,
he's your grandfather.</i>

16:17.007 --> 16:20.545
<i>Yeah? Then why didn't
he come to Dad's funeral?</i>

16:20.578 --> 16:22.380
<i>Where did that
come from?</i>

16:22.413 --> 16:23.648
<i>It was over a year ago.</i>

16:23.680 --> 16:26.417
<i>Why are you bringing
that up now?</i>

16:27.885 --> 16:29.087
I don't know.

16:29.120 --> 16:31.990
It's just weird.

16:32.022 --> 16:34.725
I don't know why he didn't come
to Dad's funeral,

16:34.758 --> 16:37.061
but I'm sure he has
his reasons.

16:37.094 --> 16:38.495
Get some sleep.

16:38.529 --> 16:40.399
Big day tomorrow.

16:41.598 --> 16:42.967
Yeah.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.803
<i>Goodnight, sweetie.</i>

16:44.835 --> 16:46.637
<i>Love you.</i>

16:52.910 --> 16:54.545
Up and at 'em!

16:54.578 --> 16:57.048
School starts in six weeks,
there's lots to be done.

16:57.080 --> 17:00.351
Meet me out the front
in 10 minutes.

17:01.419 --> 17:02.754
What time is it?

17:02.786 --> 17:03.987
<i>Let's go!</i>

17:55.906 --> 17:58.976
This has to be done every day.

17:59.010 --> 18:00.511
Why every day?

18:00.544 --> 18:04.115
'Cause there's over 80
kilometres of fencing.

18:05.849 --> 18:07.084
How far is that in miles?

18:07.117 --> 18:09.854
I'm not sure,
maybe 50 miles I reckon.

18:09.886 --> 18:11.589
Here, you try.

18:15.992 --> 18:17.495
Go on.

18:18.262 --> 18:22.768
Uh, I think... uh...
kind of like this.

18:24.769 --> 18:26.805
Were you not watching me do it?

18:26.838 --> 18:27.806
Not really.

18:27.838 --> 18:29.107
Come here.

18:33.677 --> 18:34.212
What?

18:34.244 --> 18:35.780
Shh.

18:49.092 --> 18:50.661
What're you doing?

18:50.694 --> 18:53.231
Eating a banana.
What does it look like?

18:53.263 --> 18:54.998
You're gonna shoot them?

18:55.031 --> 18:57.468
If I kill one the rest
will stay away.

18:57.501 --> 18:59.971
Leave the body by the fence,
the others won't cross.

19:00.003 --> 19:01.238
You're gonna shoot a dog?

19:01.271 --> 19:08.146
It may look like a dog, Ridley,
but they're more wolf than dog.

19:08.178 --> 19:10.514
You ever shoot one of these?

19:16.287 --> 19:17.956
Now's as good a time as any
to learn.

19:17.989 --> 19:20.525
This is a 30/30
lever action rifle.

19:20.558 --> 19:21.725
It's called a lever action

19:21.759 --> 19:25.530
because you use the lever
to load the gun.

19:25.930 --> 19:27.632
Here. Take it.

19:30.934 --> 19:32.736
First rule of using a rifle.

19:32.770 --> 19:36.007
Never aim it at anyone,
even if it's not loaded.

19:36.040 --> 19:37.841
Never put your finger
on the trigger

19:37.875 --> 19:39.978
unless you're absolutely sure
you wanna shoot something.

19:40.011 --> 19:41.579
Come here.

19:42.879 --> 19:44.215
Get in there.

19:49.119 --> 19:54.258
Ok, now breathe slowly,

19:54.291 --> 20:00.164
and when you're ready put
your finger on the trigger.

20:00.196 --> 20:01.565
<i>That's it.</i>

20:01.598 --> 20:07.004
<i>Now, let out a breath of air...
and shoot.</i>

20:11.709 --> 20:15.547
Yeah, well, that was a waste
of a bullet.

20:38.069 --> 20:39.803
- Hey.
- Morning.

20:43.206 --> 20:45.576
How was he this morning?

20:45.609 --> 20:47.911
Well, it wasn't all bad.

20:47.944 --> 20:49.681
Not all bad?

20:50.748 --> 20:51.749
How's it going?

20:51.781 --> 20:52.884
What can I get you?

20:52.916 --> 20:54.051
Uh, I'll take a coffee.

20:54.085 --> 20:55.053
Mmmhmm.

20:55.086 --> 20:56.020
Another long black, Spencer?

20:56.052 --> 20:57.754
Sure.

20:57.788 --> 21:00.223
How's the meat pie?

21:00.257 --> 21:01.458
Well, put it like this.

21:01.492 --> 21:04.761
If you ask my husband to choose
between me and the meat pie,

21:04.794 --> 21:06.029
he'd choose the pie.

21:07.164 --> 21:09.600
<i>Ok. I'll take that.</i>

21:09.634 --> 21:11.136
<i>Coming right up.</i>

21:12.770 --> 21:14.872
How did chores go?

21:14.905 --> 21:17.875
Well, he got his first shot
at a dingo today.

21:17.907 --> 21:20.144
He shot a gun at a dog?

21:20.176 --> 21:22.746
It wasn't a gun.

21:22.780 --> 21:24.115
It was a rifle.

21:24.147 --> 21:26.717
And besides, he missed.

21:26.751 --> 21:28.653
Spencer, I am not comfortable

21:28.685 --> 21:32.089
with Ridley shooting a gun
or a rifle.

21:32.123 --> 21:34.158
Yeah, well dad had a gun.

21:34.191 --> 21:35.360
That was different.

21:35.393 --> 21:37.328
He knew how to use it.

21:37.360 --> 21:39.296
And it was for protection.

21:39.329 --> 21:41.633
I can appreciate the British
should need a hand gun

21:41.665 --> 21:45.736
to go to the mall but out here
a rifle can save your life.

21:45.770 --> 21:52.644
It's not a weapon out here,
it's a tool for survival.

21:52.676 --> 21:54.344
Ok.

21:54.377 --> 21:57.848
But only if Spencer's
supervising.

21:57.882 --> 22:02.020
And I'd prefer he shoots
at cans, not animals.

22:02.886 --> 22:04.222
Here you go, mate.

22:04.922 --> 22:06.124
Wow.

22:19.770 --> 22:21.772
<i>You must be proud
of your dad, mate.</i>

22:21.806 --> 22:25.309
<i>I heard he saved seven people.</i>

22:32.316 --> 22:36.254
Spencer and I were talking,
and what do you think about

22:36.287 --> 22:38.923
you guys going out into
the outback for a night?

22:38.955 --> 22:42.459
What do you say, Ridley?
A few days in the bush?

22:42.492 --> 22:45.429
<i>Did your dad ever
take you camping?</i>

22:56.206 --> 22:57.207
Maybe you should let him go.

22:57.242 --> 22:59.277
There's nothing out there
that's gonna hurt him.

22:59.309 --> 23:01.412
He just needs some space to blow
off a little steam, is all.

23:01.444 --> 23:02.946
He'll be back.

23:04.181 --> 23:05.383
What did I say?

23:05.415 --> 23:08.319
It's not you.

23:08.351 --> 23:11.455
Camping was Bryce
and Ridley's thing.

23:11.489 --> 23:13.156
They loved it.

23:13.190 --> 23:15.460
When Ridley came back
from a trip with his dad

23:15.492 --> 23:18.195
I could not get him
to stop talking.

23:18.229 --> 23:21.165
He'd go on and on.

23:21.197 --> 23:25.436
Now I can't get him
to say anything.

23:28.271 --> 23:31.175
That's your doing.

23:31.207 --> 23:33.977
If Plunkett leaves, all their
offers go with them.

23:34.011 --> 23:36.981
Without your land
the whole deal is off.

23:37.013 --> 23:39.382
Cooper, I thank you not to
talk to me like that

23:39.415 --> 23:41.385
in front of my daughter-in-law.

23:41.417 --> 23:42.753
Daughter-in-law?

23:42.787 --> 23:45.256
That's right, my
daughter-in-law.

23:45.289 --> 23:47.357
You're Bryce's wife?

23:50.327 --> 23:52.763
I'm sorry for your loss, ma'am.

23:52.797 --> 23:55.800
Excuse the intrusion.

23:55.832 --> 23:57.334
Thank you.

23:59.936 --> 24:02.240
They don't need all your land,
Spencer.

24:02.272 --> 24:04.375
Just the northeast quarter.

24:04.407 --> 24:05.642
Lord knows you got enough.

24:05.675 --> 24:09.946
It's my bloody land and I'll do
with it what I bloody please.

24:09.980 --> 24:11.949
It's no wonder your
only son up-

24:11.982 --> 24:14.519
Leave my son out of this.

24:19.589 --> 24:22.359
Maybe we should talk
about this outside.

24:22.393 --> 24:23.494
Good idea.

24:23.527 --> 24:25.930
Easy, Coop.

24:25.963 --> 24:28.232
We're not done here, Spencer.

24:40.911 --> 24:42.847
Are they serious?

24:42.879 --> 24:45.282
Don't give them
a second thought.

25:02.132 --> 25:03.968
Hey, Riddles!

25:04.001 --> 25:05.837
It's Ridley!

25:05.869 --> 25:07.237
You out for a run, are ya?

25:07.271 --> 25:09.005
Leave me alone!

25:09.039 --> 25:10.508
Where're you goin'?

25:10.540 --> 25:12.309
Back to New York.

25:12.342 --> 25:14.411
Are you gonna run
all the way there?

25:14.444 --> 25:16.112
Maybe.

25:16.146 --> 25:18.148
Well, there's nothing much
in that direction

25:18.182 --> 25:21.986
for about 2,000 K's.

25:22.019 --> 25:27.258
If you're heading home
your best bet is to head south.

25:31.628 --> 25:35.265
How about I give you a lift back
to Buckley's, aye?

25:35.299 --> 25:37.602
And you can figure it out
from there.

25:37.635 --> 25:38.936
What do you reckon?

25:43.173 --> 25:46.143
After the outhouse exploded

25:46.175 --> 25:49.347
Bryce hid until
he thought I'd left.

25:49.379 --> 25:51.915
You should have seen his face
when he saw me.

25:51.948 --> 25:55.218
Bryce was the most stubborn kid
you can imagine.

25:55.251 --> 25:57.655
He stayed in there
for two hours.

25:57.687 --> 25:59.290
But I knew he was in there.

25:59.322 --> 26:01.324
I was determined
to wait him out.

26:01.357 --> 26:05.296
And Bryce was the stubborn one?

26:05.328 --> 26:07.665
Well... when he finally
came out and he saw me,

26:09.366 --> 26:11.368
he just started running.

26:19.076 --> 26:21.078
Yeah, that boy sure could run.

26:23.446 --> 26:24.648
How old was he?

26:26.149 --> 26:30.220
About Ridley's age, maybe 13,
I reckon.

26:30.253 --> 26:31.488
Speaking of 13 year-olds,

26:31.521 --> 26:34.090
looks like Jules has one
in his truck.

26:34.124 --> 26:35.025
Is he ok?

26:35.059 --> 26:36.559
Yeah. He's taking him back
to Buckley's.

26:36.592 --> 26:39.195
He'll be fine.

26:40.263 --> 26:42.132
Thank you.

26:42.165 --> 26:43.333
It's no bother.

26:43.367 --> 26:45.904
I mean, for everything.

27:01.652 --> 27:03.554
Everything ok?

27:09.460 --> 27:11.629
He'll be alright.

27:11.662 --> 27:13.364
Just give him a bit of time.

27:13.396 --> 27:15.366
That's all he needs.

27:15.799 --> 27:18.069
Thanks for bringing him back.

27:18.101 --> 27:21.104
No worries.

27:21.137 --> 27:24.641
You know, I see a lot of Bryce
in that young fella.

27:32.549 --> 27:33.451
Yes.

27:33.483 --> 27:35.052
Bugger.

27:35.653 --> 27:37.621
Riddles is a good runner,
you know?

27:37.654 --> 27:39.490
<i>Don't be getting
too involved with Ridley.</i>

27:39.522 --> 27:40.757
<i>Stay clear of him.</i>

27:40.790 --> 27:41.858
This is temporary.

27:41.892 --> 27:44.195
They wouldn't be here at all
if it wasn't for the kid

27:44.228 --> 27:46.330
being thrown out of every school
he's ever been put in.

27:46.363 --> 27:48.265
<i>Hopefully some hard work
and discipline</i>

27:48.298 --> 27:50.001
<i>will set him straight.</i>

27:50.033 --> 27:52.102
<i>Well, there's not a lot
of distractions out here.</i>

27:52.136 --> 27:53.003
<i>Yeah, for them maybe.</i>

27:53.037 --> 27:54.271
<i>I'm trying to run
a sheep station,</i>

27:54.305 --> 27:58.643
<i>not babysit some grieving widow
and her pain in the ass son.</i>

28:00.411 --> 28:02.179
You coulda said no.

28:02.212 --> 28:04.581
And turn my back on family,
throw that on my conscience?

28:04.615 --> 28:06.083
I can't do that,

28:06.116 --> 28:09.020
they're still my grandson
and my daughter-in-law.

28:11.355 --> 28:13.624
What're you complaining
about then?

28:15.192 --> 28:17.528
Oh, shut up.

28:37.146 --> 28:40.617
We were supposed to be
on the road 30 minutes ago.

28:40.651 --> 28:41.586
I know.

28:41.618 --> 28:44.821
Well, if you knew, why didn't-
never mind.

28:44.855 --> 28:47.223
Your gear and your water
are there.

28:47.257 --> 28:49.527
It's going to get
very hot very fast

28:49.559 --> 28:52.629
which is why it would have been
better to leave 30 minutes ago.

28:54.498 --> 28:55.499
This too?

28:55.531 --> 28:57.233
<i>Yep.</i>

28:57.267 --> 28:58.636
What if it goes off?

28:58.668 --> 29:00.604
It's not loaded.

29:32.235 --> 29:33.270
Are there snakes out here?

29:33.302 --> 29:34.405
Yep.

29:50.887 --> 29:54.125
Try to keep up and put
the camera away.

30:04.167 --> 30:05.802
These are heavy.

30:05.836 --> 30:09.707
Well, the good news is they can
only get lighter as we go.

30:14.377 --> 30:17.747
I would wait if I were you.

30:17.780 --> 30:22.252
You want it but
you don't need it.

30:26.690 --> 30:27.491
Go on! Get on!

30:27.523 --> 30:29.893
Hyah! Hyah!

30:36.800 --> 30:37.902
Good morning, Jules.

30:37.934 --> 30:39.470
Good morning, sis.

30:39.502 --> 30:41.739
How can I help out around here?

30:41.771 --> 30:43.741
Don't know.

30:43.773 --> 30:47.244
You know anything about sheep?

31:07.364 --> 31:10.201
Don't fill your belly,
you'll get a cramp.

31:10.233 --> 31:12.837
Those have to last us.

31:17.241 --> 31:19.944
If we didn't have water
how long would we last?

31:19.976 --> 31:22.946
Like, before we die.

31:22.980 --> 31:26.684
Well, that's a good question,
and the answer is it depends.

31:26.716 --> 31:29.219
In this heat, two or three days

31:29.252 --> 31:31.888
depending on how much
you exert yourself.

31:31.922 --> 31:32.990
An even better question is:

31:33.022 --> 31:36.492
<i>How do I find water out here
should I need it?</i>

31:36.526 --> 31:39.930
Oh, no. Not the bloody
camera again.

31:39.963 --> 31:40.998
Come on.

31:41.030 --> 31:43.800
It'll be like a documentary
on desert survival.

31:43.834 --> 31:45.469
Like Bear Grillis.

31:45.501 --> 31:47.503
What, like a doco?

31:47.537 --> 31:48.606
A what?

31:48.638 --> 31:50.674
You know.

31:50.706 --> 31:52.943
Just pretend like you're
talking to me.

31:52.975 --> 31:55.478
Well, I am talking to you.

31:55.511 --> 31:58.715
I mean, pretend like
the camera isn't here.

32:01.617 --> 32:03.553
Ok, go ahead.

32:03.587 --> 32:05.888
If you're out here
without water

32:05.922 --> 32:08.358
there are a few ways
to find water.

32:08.392 --> 32:10.394
The first is animal tracks.

32:13.396 --> 32:14.298
The second-

32:14.331 --> 32:17.534
That's the biggest snake
I have ever seen!

32:18.034 --> 32:22.705
Don't worry, it's not poisonous.

32:22.739 --> 32:23.874
How can you tell?

32:23.906 --> 32:25.074
Experience.

32:25.107 --> 32:27.778
Besides, if you don't bother
them, they won't bother you.

32:27.810 --> 32:31.415
Tuck your pants into your socks.
You'll be fine.

32:31.447 --> 32:36.019
If it was poisonous, do you
have to suck the blood out?

32:36.052 --> 32:38.988
No, that's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

32:39.021 --> 32:42.592
Once the venom's in your
system you can't suck it out.

32:42.626 --> 32:45.596
So what happens?

32:46.963 --> 32:48.398
You die.

32:48.432 --> 32:49.900
What?!

32:51.568 --> 32:55.973
Well, depends on the snake
and the size of the victim,

32:56.005 --> 33:00.643
but a boy your size
and a brown snake,

33:00.676 --> 33:02.812
yeah, probably die.

33:02.846 --> 33:04.415
The key is to remain calm.

33:04.447 --> 33:07.517
The faster your heart beats
the faster the poison

33:07.550 --> 33:10.486
enters your system and tries
to shut it down.

33:10.520 --> 33:13.389
Ideally, you would get the
victim to hospital in time

33:13.423 --> 33:16.493
but out here what are
the chances?

33:27.436 --> 33:28.905
Who's Buckley?

33:31.073 --> 33:33.976
Mr. William Buckley.

33:34.010 --> 33:37.080
Ok, who's William Buckley?

33:37.880 --> 33:42.418
Mr. William Buckley was sent
to Australia as a prisoner

33:42.452 --> 33:48.826
on a ship and the day that
Buckley's ship landed ashore,

33:48.858 --> 33:53.530
well he escaped
and ran into the bush.

33:53.562 --> 33:55.565
What happened to him?

33:55.598 --> 34:02.539
Well, most people thought that
Mr. William Buckley was dead.

34:02.571 --> 34:09.847
Thirty years later he walks out
of the bush, fit and healthy.

34:09.879 --> 34:14.684
You know, some Australians say
you got little or no chance,

34:14.717 --> 34:16.652
you got a Buckley's.

34:16.685 --> 34:19.956
You know, when Spencer opened
this sheep station

34:19.989 --> 34:23.893
they said he had
a Buckley's chance.

34:23.926 --> 34:26.362
But he made it work.

34:27.563 --> 34:32.969
Spencer may be strict
but he's fair.

34:33.002 --> 34:35.438
Is that why Bryce left?

34:35.472 --> 34:38.775
I tried to get him to talk about
it but he never wanted to.

34:38.809 --> 34:40.944
Fathers and sons.

34:40.976 --> 34:43.679
Don't try to understand Spence.

34:43.713 --> 34:46.684
It'll be easier on everyone.

35:16.213 --> 35:21.084
Can I use that knife?

35:53.984 --> 35:55.853
No, keep it.

36:03.193 --> 36:06.729
My dad never let me
have a knife.

36:06.763 --> 36:08.232
Why not? It's a tool.

36:08.265 --> 36:10.600
A bloody good tool.

36:10.633 --> 36:13.002
He told me the story of how
he got the scar on his stomach.

36:13.035 --> 36:14.604
What story is that?

36:14.638 --> 36:17.107
Three guys were hassling
this girl

36:17.140 --> 36:21.211
so dad went over
and told them to stop.

36:21.243 --> 36:23.546
They didn't like that.

36:23.580 --> 36:28.051
Dad got two of them
but the third guy...

36:28.084 --> 36:30.687
the third guy got him right here
in the stomach.

36:30.720 --> 36:32.222
Right here?

36:35.225 --> 36:38.595
That's not how he got
that scar.

36:38.627 --> 36:40.796
He watched the movie
The Great Escape

36:40.830 --> 36:43.634
and the damn fool tried to jump
an ATV over the fence

36:43.667 --> 36:45.736
like Steve bloody McQueen.

36:45.769 --> 36:47.037
What happened?

36:47.069 --> 36:48.705
Dummy never came close.

36:48.738 --> 36:50.107
When I found him he was hanging
from the wire

36:50.140 --> 36:52.242
crying like a baby.

36:52.274 --> 36:55.177
Bloody pain in the ass.

36:55.211 --> 36:57.281
It runs in the family.

36:57.314 --> 36:59.950
Excuse me?

36:59.982 --> 37:02.618
Well, if my dad was
a big pain in the ass

37:02.651 --> 37:04.754
then his son must be, too.

37:04.787 --> 37:06.255
- What about my mom?
- That's enough.

37:06.289 --> 37:08.892
- Is she a pain in the ass?
- That's enough.

37:08.925 --> 37:10.993
I heard you talking to Jules
last night.

37:11.026 --> 37:12.762
Yeah? What'd you hear?

37:12.796 --> 37:13.964
Why don't you just be honest?

37:13.997 --> 37:16.300
You don't want me
or my mom here.

37:16.332 --> 37:17.867
You figured that out
all by yourself?

37:17.901 --> 37:19.703
You're quite the Sherlock
Holmes.

37:19.736 --> 37:21.772
Listen, your dad walked out
of here a long time ago

37:21.805 --> 37:23.040
and he never came back.

37:23.073 --> 37:24.308
He turned his back on me,

37:24.341 --> 37:26.310
but I won't turn my back
on his family.

37:26.343 --> 37:28.011
He and I may not have always
gotten along

37:28.044 --> 37:30.747
but he was still my son and
you're still my bloody grandson,

37:30.780 --> 37:32.883
like it or not.

37:32.915 --> 37:35.151
I always used to think my dad
moved to New York

37:35.185 --> 37:37.988
because he hated Australia.

37:38.021 --> 37:40.790
He never left because
he hated Australia.

37:40.823 --> 37:44.227
He left because he hated you!

37:46.796 --> 37:49.265
Yeah, go on, run away!

37:53.303 --> 37:55.873
Clearly your father's son!

38:10.086 --> 38:11.254
Ow!

38:44.053 --> 38:46.389
Take it easy, boy.

38:46.423 --> 38:48.825
I'm not gonna hurt ya.

38:57.901 --> 39:02.373
I'm gonna take this
off your leg, ok?

39:17.019 --> 39:19.055
It's ok, boy.

39:38.040 --> 39:41.912
Uh, you're welcome?

40:26.522 --> 40:29.158
That was the stupidest
bloody thing I've ever seen.

40:29.191 --> 40:32.295
He could have been on your neck
in an instant.

40:43.039 --> 40:47.444
<i>If you're out here without
water there are a few ways to find it.</i>

40:47.477 --> 40:50.981
<i>That's the biggest snake
I have ever seen.</i>

40:51.013 --> 40:54.216
<i>Don't worry,
it's not poisonous.</i>

40:54.249 --> 40:55.852
<i>How can you-</i>

41:47.636 --> 41:49.004
G'day, Spencer.

41:49.037 --> 41:50.039
Spencer.

41:50.073 --> 41:51.341
What do you want?

41:51.374 --> 41:54.044
Oh, we've come to apologize
on behalf of Cooper.

41:54.077 --> 41:55.511
He's got a hot head, aye?

41:56.278 --> 41:57.446
Yeah.

41:59.214 --> 42:01.050
But we're all trying to do
what's best for everyone here.

42:01.084 --> 42:04.921
I'm not interested.

42:04.953 --> 42:07.089
I understand, mate.

42:07.122 --> 42:10.025
Hey, look, Spencer,

42:10.059 --> 42:12.095
Plunkett could up their offer.

42:12.127 --> 42:13.363
So if you're holding out
for more money-

42:13.396 --> 42:16.399
The answer's no.

42:16.432 --> 42:18.435
You could profit by this,
Spencer.

42:18.468 --> 42:20.370
You'll come out ahead.

42:20.403 --> 42:23.106
This is private property.
Bugger off.

42:26.008 --> 42:28.377
Why are you pointing
that thing at me?

42:28.944 --> 42:32.381
Oh, sorry mate, I didn't realize
what I was doing.

42:32.414 --> 42:34.316
The fact remains
this is private property

42:34.350 --> 42:36.086
and it's gonna stay that way.

42:36.118 --> 42:37.453
You're making a big mistake.

42:37.486 --> 42:39.622
Be that as it may.

42:41.390 --> 42:44.394
Someone needs to knock
some sense into you, old man.

42:44.426 --> 42:46.396
You're standing in the way
of progress.

42:46.428 --> 42:48.898
You're standing in the way
of a 12-gauge shot gun

42:48.932 --> 42:51.001
that's about to go off.

42:54.970 --> 43:01.143
One way or another, Spencer,
you're gonna get on board.

44:47.249 --> 44:50.285
<i>I thought you guys only traveled
in packs.</i>

44:50.318 --> 44:53.222
<i>Where are the rest
of your buddies?</i>

45:03.732 --> 45:07.136
♪ I saddled up and away
I did go, ♪

45:07.169 --> 45:13.042
♪ riding alone in the dark ♪

45:14.410 --> 45:15.678
That was a good one.

45:41.703 --> 45:43.106
Mick, no!

45:43.138 --> 45:44.673
Oh right, this way.

45:44.707 --> 45:45.575
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

45:51.314 --> 45:52.082
Mick! Mick!

45:55.450 --> 45:57.453
<i>A bucket.</i>

45:57.486 --> 45:58.687
<i>Mick! Mick!</i>

45:58.720 --> 45:59.789
Mick!

45:59.821 --> 46:01.825
You're gonna get us caught.

46:01.857 --> 46:05.095
Ok. time to teach
this old bastard a lesson.

46:05.127 --> 46:05.794
Yeah.

46:05.827 --> 46:06.528
Let's do this.

46:06.562 --> 46:07.397
Yeah, yeah.

46:07.696 --> 46:09.198
Oh, that hurt a bit.

46:09.231 --> 46:10.300
- I'm sorry.
- No worries.

46:10.332 --> 46:12.601
<i>Anyway, I'm so sick
of that old bastard</i>

46:12.635 --> 46:14.470
<i>poncing around town
telling us what to do.</i>

46:14.504 --> 46:15.472
<i>Yeah, me too.</i>

46:15.504 --> 46:16.472
<i>It's our time, Micky.
It's our time.</i>

46:16.506 --> 46:18.241
<i>It's our time to shine.
Let's go.</i>

46:18.274 --> 46:19.142
<i>I'm ready to shine.</i>

46:19.175 --> 46:20.810
Anyway, give us the petrol.

46:23.879 --> 46:26.482
I- I thought you grabbed
the petrol.

46:29.252 --> 46:29.853
Bloody idiot.

46:29.885 --> 46:31.287
<i>Yeah, sorry.</i>

46:49.338 --> 46:51.473
Good boy.

46:51.506 --> 46:53.342
Easy now.

47:01.184 --> 47:03.720
Where's the gas?

47:03.752 --> 47:05.722
There's a dingo.

47:05.754 --> 47:06.555
What?

47:06.589 --> 47:08.725
There's a bloody-
there's a dingo.

47:08.758 --> 47:11.493
Near the truck.

47:11.526 --> 47:12.427
A dingo.

47:12.461 --> 47:13.330
Yeah.

47:15.830 --> 47:19.635
You want something done right you
gotta bloody well do it yourself.

47:19.669 --> 47:21.771
What does that mean?

47:28.377 --> 47:29.512
Nothing.

47:29.544 --> 47:30.546
No dingo, mate.

47:30.580 --> 47:31.848
<i>I tell you Oscar,
he was right there.</i>

47:31.881 --> 47:33.517
Yeah, well he's not here now.

47:43.725 --> 47:45.828
Told ya.

47:47.495 --> 47:48.330
Get the rifle.

47:48.363 --> 47:49.932
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

48:00.709 --> 48:02.711
Someone's up!
Let's get outta here!

49:00.035 --> 49:01.003
I checked the bedroom.

49:01.037 --> 49:04.741
His shoes are gone and
his camera is missing.

49:04.774 --> 49:06.476
Do you think he ran away?

49:06.508 --> 49:08.644
All the four-wheelers and
the trucks are still here.

49:08.678 --> 49:10.946
So wherever he went,
he went on foot.

49:10.979 --> 49:12.781
Well, then he couldn't
have gotten far.

49:12.814 --> 49:14.316
Exactly.

49:25.394 --> 49:26.896
Hmm?

49:47.515 --> 49:49.851
I called the police and emailed
them pictures of Ridley.

49:49.885 --> 49:52.488
Well, I put out a message
on the CB to all the truckies

49:52.521 --> 49:54.423
and the farmers just in case
they see him.

49:54.457 --> 49:56.326
Grab that table.

49:57.626 --> 50:01.430
Now, if he's on foot

50:01.464 --> 50:05.535
he couldn't have gone more
than 10, 20K.

50:05.568 --> 50:06.569
Not in this heat.

50:06.602 --> 50:07.502
Right. We're here.

50:07.537 --> 50:09.972
Let's say we search within
20 kilometres.

50:10.004 --> 50:11.673
Jules, you take
the northwest section.

50:11.707 --> 50:13.710
Will, you and John cover
the east corner

50:13.743 --> 50:15.345
and I'll take
the south section.

50:15.377 --> 50:16.446
Ok, what about me?

50:16.479 --> 50:17.446
I- I can't just sit here.

50:17.479 --> 50:19.048
You don't know the area
and I need someone here

50:19.080 --> 50:21.318
in case he comes back.

50:21.718 --> 50:24.553
Also, someone to give detailed
descriptions to the police

50:24.586 --> 50:26.055
if they call.

50:26.722 --> 50:28.390
Stay on the CB.

50:32.595 --> 50:33.897
Shit.

50:36.097 --> 50:37.666
What the hell are we supposed
to do with him?

50:37.700 --> 50:38.768
I don't know.

50:38.801 --> 50:40.569
I mean, trashing a barn
is one thing,

50:40.602 --> 50:43.438
Oscar, but this...
this is bloody kidnapping.

50:43.472 --> 50:44.841
Shut up, Micky.

50:44.874 --> 50:47.577
No one's kidnapping anyone.

50:49.444 --> 50:51.814
So you're gonna let me go?

50:54.883 --> 50:56.485
Chuck him in there.

50:56.519 --> 50:57.819
In the bathroom?

50:57.852 --> 50:59.789
In the bathroom.

51:08.531 --> 51:13.103
Just... duck in there
for a sec for us?

51:17.772 --> 51:19.475
Come on, tick-tock.

51:23.611 --> 51:25.615
Thanks, buddy. Yeah.

51:25.914 --> 51:27.716
It'll just be a couple of
minutes, alright?

51:35.591 --> 51:38.060
No one's kidnapping anyone.

51:38.093 --> 51:40.897
We just forced a kid into
the bathroom and locked him in.

51:40.930 --> 51:42.932
Technically, I think
we're kidnapping him right now.

51:42.964 --> 51:44.800
Listen.

51:44.834 --> 51:46.836
That little bugger must've hid
in the back of the truck

51:46.868 --> 51:47.736
back at Spencer's place.

51:47.769 --> 51:48.970
Yeah.

51:49.004 --> 51:51.874
As far as I'm concerned I'm
holding on to that little thief

51:51.906 --> 51:53.075
until the coppers get here.

51:53.107 --> 51:54.709
That's good.

51:59.714 --> 52:00.850
Who is it, Mick?

52:00.883 --> 52:02.518
It's the cops.

52:02.551 --> 52:03.920
Did you already call 'em?

52:03.952 --> 52:05.921
No, you idiot.

52:05.955 --> 52:07.657
Go and talk to 'em.

52:08.790 --> 52:10.459
What am I supposed to say?

52:12.694 --> 52:14.763
Tell 'em you had to use
the toilet.

52:16.231 --> 52:17.766
But we're in the outback.

52:17.800 --> 52:19.635
The whole thing's
a potential toilet.

52:19.667 --> 52:22.137
Well... tell them
you're fancy then,

52:22.171 --> 52:24.640
you need a proper bowl
or you can't go.

52:24.673 --> 52:25.841
Listen.

52:25.874 --> 52:27.944
If they find that kid in here
we're both going to jail.

52:27.977 --> 52:29.479
What?

52:29.944 --> 52:31.213
Go on.

52:40.222 --> 52:41.591
G'day, Officer.

52:41.624 --> 52:43.559
G'day.

52:43.591 --> 52:46.095
Can I ask what
you're doing here?

52:46.127 --> 52:48.930
I- I just had to use
the facilities, you know?

52:48.964 --> 52:51.968
So I just thought
I'd duck in there.

52:52.001 --> 52:54.669
Did you not see the signs around
the property to keep out?

52:54.702 --> 52:56.071
Oh, shit.

52:56.104 --> 53:00.208
I- it's just... you know,
when nature calls.

53:00.242 --> 53:02.511
Well, nature calling or not,
that's trespassing.

53:02.544 --> 53:04.113
Yep.

53:06.582 --> 53:08.050
Oh, g'day Officer.

53:08.082 --> 53:10.086
G'day.

53:12.687 --> 53:17.026
I was just asking your friend
what you guys are doing here.

53:17.059 --> 53:20.662
Oh, my brother, he had to use
the facilities.

53:20.696 --> 53:22.832
He's fancy that way.

53:22.865 --> 53:27.035
Needs a proper bog, y'know?

53:27.068 --> 53:28.971
Uh-huh.

53:36.345 --> 53:37.847
I'm on the lookout for a boy.

53:37.879 --> 53:38.680
Oh.

53:38.714 --> 53:39.282
Ridley Anderson.

53:39.314 --> 53:40.148
Oh.

53:40.182 --> 53:43.652
Is he about 14 years old,
dark hair?

53:43.685 --> 53:45.254
Yeah, that fits the description.

53:45.287 --> 53:48.256
Oh yeah, no, I seen a kid
like that about an hour ago.

53:48.289 --> 53:49.824
Really? That's funny,
'cause I didn't see him.

53:49.857 --> 53:52.227
Oh, you were too busy
whining about needing a toilet.

53:52.260 --> 53:53.061
Remember that?

53:53.095 --> 53:53.863
Oh, yeah.

53:53.896 --> 53:54.964
Station, this is Madge.

53:54.997 --> 53:56.799
We may have a possible sighting
of the Anderson boy.

53:56.832 --> 53:58.167
Where exactly?

53:58.200 --> 54:02.071
Up the road probably 20K
or so south.

54:02.104 --> 54:05.207
Somewhere in the vicinity
of kilometre marker 875

54:05.240 --> 54:07.243
heading to location now.
Over.

54:11.981 --> 54:13.149
No, I-

54:13.182 --> 54:14.216
Excuse me?

54:14.249 --> 54:15.785
I...

54:19.821 --> 54:21.256
Um... I don't think
I flushed.

54:22.790 --> 54:24.059
Sorry.

54:32.334 --> 54:34.636
The next time you see
a kid out here alone,

54:34.669 --> 54:36.372
stop and see if he needs help,
for Pete's sake.

54:36.405 --> 54:37.740
Right, aye.

54:37.772 --> 54:39.341
And get out of here.
You're trespassing.

54:39.374 --> 54:41.276
- Yes, Officer.
- Ma'am.

55:52.080 --> 55:54.283
He couldn't have gotten far.

55:56.017 --> 55:57.986
You think he would just
head back to the mine?

55:58.019 --> 55:59.320
Where else is he gonna go?

55:59.354 --> 56:02.091
Yeah.

56:07.296 --> 56:09.799
Eventually he'll have
to come back.

56:09.832 --> 56:13.002
And I'll teach that little
bastard a lesson when he does.

56:22.077 --> 56:26.915
Um... can we get something
to eat?

56:33.955 --> 56:35.925
Guess not.

57:05.254 --> 57:06.289
Ha!

57:11.859 --> 57:13.495
Not in there.

58:13.622 --> 58:15.223
You.

58:16.325 --> 58:17.894
Hey buddy.

58:19.961 --> 58:21.797
How's the leg?

58:26.868 --> 58:28.470
Easy. Easy.

58:29.338 --> 58:32.006
Ok, alright. Alright.

58:32.039 --> 58:34.042
Hey. Hey, buddy.

58:37.412 --> 58:40.049
That leg's looking better.

58:46.321 --> 58:49.357
<i>It's just not like him
to leave like this.</i>

58:49.390 --> 58:54.930
Don't worry, we'll find him.

58:54.963 --> 58:59.368
What happened between you two
last night?

58:59.401 --> 59:02.872
He accused me of
not wanting you here.

59:02.905 --> 59:05.240
I told him I'd never turn
my back on family

59:05.274 --> 59:08.077
and he stormed off.

59:08.109 --> 59:09.979
After a few minutes
I went after him,

59:10.011 --> 59:12.948
I stood on a ridge and watched
the damn fool rescue a dingo

59:12.981 --> 59:14.950
caught in a fence.

59:14.982 --> 59:16.151
What?

59:16.184 --> 59:17.553
He went right up
and calmed him,

59:17.586 --> 59:20.155
released the leg hold
to free him.

59:20.187 --> 59:22.023
I mean, there was no way
the dingo would have made it

59:22.057 --> 59:26.162
through the night, it
was heroic but stupid.

59:26.896 --> 59:28.129
Anyway, he came back
to the camp site,

59:28.164 --> 59:31.165
went straight to bed, we got up
at first light and headed home.

59:31.198 --> 59:33.202
I haven't spoken to him since.

59:35.202 --> 59:37.438
Is that what happened to Bryce?

59:37.472 --> 59:39.508
He woke up one morning and left?

59:39.540 --> 59:40.742
That's right.

59:40.776 --> 59:44.113
He left and never came home.
That's exactly what happened.

59:44.146 --> 59:47.415
Your track record is not very
good with sons or grandsons.

59:47.448 --> 59:48.950
If you think you can
come here and-

59:48.984 --> 59:51.287
<i>Come in, Spencer. Over.</i>

59:51.319 --> 59:54.622
This is Spencer. Come in.

59:54.656 --> 59:56.592
<i>Spencer, I spoke to the patrol
woman from the quarry.</i>

59:56.624 --> 59:58.459
<i>She said she'll meet me up
there in about 10 minutes, over.</i>

59:58.493 --> 01:00:00.363
Copy that, Jules.
We'll be there.

01:01:29.184 --> 01:01:31.519
I don't think he's coming back,
Oscar.

01:01:31.553 --> 01:01:35.624
Yeah, I reckon you're right.

01:01:35.656 --> 01:01:38.093
Listen, Mick.

01:01:38.126 --> 01:01:41.463
We need to keep this between us.

01:01:41.495 --> 01:01:45.133
If the cops find out we had him
out here and he dies

01:01:45.167 --> 01:01:47.036
then we're both going
to jail.

01:01:47.068 --> 01:01:48.369
I don't wanna go to jail.

01:01:48.403 --> 01:01:50.238
No, you don't, Mick.

01:01:50.272 --> 01:01:53.509
We need to find that kid
before the coppers do.

01:01:53.542 --> 01:01:57.379
Yeah, 'cause if we find him
then we'll be heroes.

01:01:57.412 --> 01:02:00.381
Maybe that'd make Spencer
change his mind

01:02:00.414 --> 01:02:02.183
about the Plunkett deal.

01:02:02.216 --> 01:02:04.153
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

01:02:04.185 --> 01:02:05.421
Yeah.

01:02:05.453 --> 01:02:07.656
And how're we gonna explain what
we're doing in Spencer's barn

01:02:07.689 --> 01:02:09.357
in the middle of
the bloody night?

01:02:09.390 --> 01:02:13.361
Yeah, right.

01:02:13.394 --> 01:02:14.695
Come on, let's just
get out of here

01:02:14.729 --> 01:02:17.533
and come back when it's light.

01:02:17.566 --> 01:02:20.836
If we can find that kid
before the cops do

01:02:20.868 --> 01:02:23.338
maybe we can talk some sense
into him and get him home.

01:02:23.370 --> 01:02:24.338
Good idea.

01:02:24.372 --> 01:02:25.540
I know.

01:02:40.321 --> 01:02:41.856
You see anything?

01:02:41.890 --> 01:02:43.559
Nothing.

01:02:47.294 --> 01:02:49.197
Jules, come in.

01:02:49.231 --> 01:02:50.665
<i>This is Jules, over.</i>

01:02:50.698 --> 01:02:52.200
Any news your end?

01:02:52.234 --> 01:02:54.436
<i>Negative, Spencer.
All quiet here at the ranch.</i>

01:02:54.468 --> 01:02:57.738
<i>There's no news from the police
or search parties. Over.</i>

01:02:57.772 --> 01:02:59.275
Copy that.

01:03:04.211 --> 01:03:06.414
Gloria. Gloria.

01:03:06.448 --> 01:03:07.883
We'll find him.

01:03:07.915 --> 01:03:11.586
We'll find him, I promise you
we'll find him.

01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:13.856
I promise you.

01:03:15.189 --> 01:03:16.791
There you are.

01:03:43.185 --> 01:03:44.453
<i>Are you ready
for this weekend?</i>

01:03:44.486 --> 01:03:46.321
Yes. I've taken care
of all of it.

01:03:46.354 --> 01:03:47.289
The most important thing?

01:03:47.321 --> 01:03:48.756
First aid kit,
and it's packed.

01:03:48.789 --> 01:03:49.757
Good man.

01:03:49.790 --> 01:03:51.526
And did you go through
my old first aid book?

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:56.298
Yeah. I did burns,
setting a wound, and CPR,

01:03:56.330 --> 01:03:57.566
and I think that's it.

01:03:57.598 --> 01:04:00.202
Right. So if I get hurt I can
count on you to take care of me?

01:04:00.234 --> 01:04:01.769
I'm your man, Dad.

01:04:01.803 --> 01:04:04.240
<i>Ok, good to know.</i>

01:04:09.611 --> 01:04:11.480
How are you going?

01:04:11.513 --> 01:04:13.781
Are you hungry?

01:04:14.548 --> 01:04:16.551
Want some jerky?

01:04:16.984 --> 01:04:18.187
Hey.

01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:19.522
Alright, come on.

01:04:21.423 --> 01:04:22.390
Come on.

01:04:22.423 --> 01:04:24.159
Good boy.

01:04:24.827 --> 01:04:27.595
You wanna-you wanna come
lie down?

01:04:30.531 --> 01:04:32.367
Yeah, you're ok.

01:04:32.934 --> 01:04:34.435
Hey, buddy.

01:04:34.970 --> 01:04:36.539
Hey.

01:04:45.981 --> 01:04:48.684
Maybe I should give you a name.

01:04:50.718 --> 01:04:52.854
What about Jerky?

01:04:53.622 --> 01:04:55.357
Yeah, no.

01:04:55.390 --> 01:04:57.225
That's not great.

01:04:57.959 --> 01:04:58.961
Hmm.

01:05:00.528 --> 01:05:03.432
I know. Buckley.

01:05:03.464 --> 01:05:09.303
Yeah. Yeah, Buckley.
You like it, hey bud?

01:05:09.336 --> 01:05:10.338
Buckley.

01:05:14.376 --> 01:05:16.745
Buckley it is.

01:05:19.981 --> 01:05:20.848
Jules, this is Spencer.

01:05:20.881 --> 01:05:22.818
It's getting too dark
to keep looking.

01:05:22.850 --> 01:05:25.421
We're gonna go back
to Buckley's. Over.

01:06:58.979 --> 01:07:00.682
Hey! Hey!

01:07:05.886 --> 01:07:06.988
- Is that him?
- What?

01:07:07.021 --> 01:07:08.557
Over there.

01:07:13.627 --> 01:07:14.963
It's a bloody dingo, you dummy.

01:07:14.995 --> 01:07:16.030
Oh.

01:07:16.064 --> 01:07:17.098
Sorry.

01:07:17.131 --> 01:07:18.533
Give me that.

01:07:28.109 --> 01:07:29.711
Come on. Come here.

01:07:29.743 --> 01:07:30.778
Come on!

01:07:30.812 --> 01:07:32.414
You're gonna get us caught!

01:07:38.586 --> 01:07:39.388
Get down, Buckley.

01:07:39.421 --> 01:07:40.422
Get down!

01:07:44.526 --> 01:07:45.461
Get down!

01:07:51.198 --> 01:07:52.166
Come on. Come on.

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:53.502
Come here. Come here.

01:07:53.535 --> 01:07:54.102
Yeah. Get down.

01:07:54.135 --> 01:07:55.002
Get down.

01:07:55.035 --> 01:07:55.903
See?

01:07:55.937 --> 01:07:57.573
I told you, you should have
got down.

01:07:58.506 --> 01:07:59.975
Ah, dammit.

01:08:01.876 --> 01:08:03.778
He moved.

01:08:03.812 --> 01:08:05.047
You saw it.

01:08:05.613 --> 01:08:07.948
Besides, I think the sight
on this thing is off, anyway.

01:08:12.019 --> 01:08:13.621
Alright.

01:08:14.823 --> 01:08:16.691
Come on.

01:08:16.723 --> 01:08:18.493
Come on.

01:08:28.167 --> 01:08:29.937
Morning, Spencer.
Any luck?

01:08:29.970 --> 01:08:31.506
Nothing, I'm afraid.

01:08:31.537 --> 01:08:32.573
Jules and I covered the area

01:08:32.606 --> 01:08:35.176
from Stirling Pass through
east of Maynard's place.

01:08:35.209 --> 01:08:37.145
We gave it a good once over.

01:08:37.176 --> 01:08:39.013
We thoroughly searched the area
he was reported in

01:08:39.046 --> 01:08:40.915
but there's just no sign.

01:08:40.948 --> 01:08:43.885
Where were you when they told
you they'd spotted Ridley?

01:08:43.917 --> 01:08:45.921
Up at the old Patterson quarry,
why?

01:08:45.953 --> 01:08:47.656
Well, that's miles from here.

01:08:47.689 --> 01:08:49.591
Maybe he got a ride somehow.

01:08:49.622 --> 01:08:50.524
Anyway, it's worth a shot.

01:08:50.559 --> 01:08:52.060
I'll head up there
and take a look around.

01:08:52.091 --> 01:08:53.194
I'll meet you up there.

01:08:53.227 --> 01:08:54.595
I'm coming with you.

01:08:54.627 --> 01:08:56.064
Are you sure you don't wanna
stay here?

01:08:56.095 --> 01:08:57.631
Yeah.

01:08:59.934 --> 01:09:02.236
Cooper, now is not
a good time.

01:09:02.270 --> 01:09:06.207
I heard about your grandson
on the CB.

01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:10.011
I'm here to help.

01:09:10.743 --> 01:09:11.912
Good on you, mate.

01:09:11.944 --> 01:09:13.848
Jules'll bring you up to speed.

01:09:15.883 --> 01:09:17.453
We'll find him, love.

01:10:08.136 --> 01:10:11.806
Ok, Buckley. Where can
I find water?

01:10:11.838 --> 01:10:15.676
Spencer said to look for animal
tracks and they lead to water.

01:10:15.709 --> 01:10:16.778
Hey, let me...

01:10:23.851 --> 01:10:26.087
My camera!

01:10:26.119 --> 01:10:27.721
Oh no.

01:10:27.754 --> 01:10:29.624
No! No!

01:10:32.126 --> 01:10:33.695
Come on!

01:10:33.727 --> 01:10:37.632
Are you serious?

01:10:37.664 --> 01:10:38.899
No way.

01:10:38.932 --> 01:10:40.734
This is a pro-zoom camera!

01:10:40.767 --> 01:10:42.604
<i>I'm not even gonna
pretend I know what that means.</i>

01:10:42.637 --> 01:10:43.738
<i>You like it?</i>

01:10:43.770 --> 01:10:46.107
I love it! Thank you.

01:10:47.175 --> 01:10:49.043
<i>I did mention it wasn't cheap.</i>

01:10:49.077 --> 01:10:50.044
I'll take good care of it.

01:10:50.078 --> 01:10:51.146
I swear.

01:10:53.247 --> 01:10:54.316
No!

01:10:54.348 --> 01:10:57.985
No! No!

01:10:58.019 --> 01:10:59.253
No!

01:10:59.287 --> 01:11:01.789
Go away, you stupid dog!

01:11:29.117 --> 01:11:31.319
Did they say what
they were doing here?

01:11:31.351 --> 01:11:34.221
That they needed to use
the toilet.

01:11:34.254 --> 01:11:36.056
The whole outback is a toilet.

01:11:36.089 --> 01:11:37.092
Exactly.

01:11:37.124 --> 01:11:38.659
I thought that was a bit off.

01:11:38.693 --> 01:11:40.794
We'll take a drive up there
and look around.

01:11:40.828 --> 01:11:42.263
I'll leave channel four
open for you.

01:11:42.296 --> 01:11:44.999
Thanks. I'll let you know
if we need anything.

01:11:50.404 --> 01:11:53.941
Was Ridley close with Bryce?

01:11:53.975 --> 01:11:55.677
Yeah.

01:11:55.709 --> 01:11:58.680
Bryce was Ridley's hero.

01:11:58.712 --> 01:12:02.249
Always wanted to be
just like dad.

01:12:02.283 --> 01:12:05.720
Bryce never wanted to be
anything like me.

01:12:05.753 --> 01:12:07.222
That boy wanted out of here

01:12:07.254 --> 01:12:10.124
the moment he found out
that was an option.

01:12:10.158 --> 01:12:12.394
Once he realized rugby
was his best chance

01:12:12.427 --> 01:12:16.397
of getting out of this place he
got pretty focused pretty fast.

01:12:16.431 --> 01:12:18.833
He always had a great head
for the game.

01:12:18.865 --> 01:12:20.834
It was like he knew where
the ball was going to be

01:12:20.868 --> 01:12:23.672
long before it got there.

01:12:23.704 --> 01:12:27.074
The day that Sarah and I
came home from the doctor's

01:12:27.107 --> 01:12:30.945
with the news that she
was terminal,

01:12:30.977 --> 01:12:34.015
Bryce got a letter from the
Australian National Rugby Association

01:12:34.047 --> 01:12:37.051
inviting him to train
for four months in Sydney.

01:12:39.887 --> 01:12:42.757
You didn't tell him.

01:12:42.789 --> 01:12:45.025
You never told him
she was terminal.

01:12:45.059 --> 01:12:46.727
He didn't know what he was
giving up,

01:12:46.761 --> 01:12:48.463
he was just a kid.

01:12:48.495 --> 01:12:50.330
It was the opportunity
of a lifetime.

01:12:50.364 --> 01:12:53.834
I didn't want him on the farm
in 20 years

01:12:53.868 --> 01:12:55.470
and he didn't wanna be there
in 20 years

01:12:55.503 --> 01:12:58.206
and there was bloody nothing
he could have done for Sarah.

01:13:00.141 --> 01:13:04.412
Six weeks after Bryce left
Sarah died.

01:13:04.445 --> 01:13:09.951
Bryce came home, found out
what we'd kept from him.

01:13:09.984 --> 01:13:11.453
How did he take it?

01:13:11.485 --> 01:13:13.689
Not well.

01:13:14.321 --> 01:13:15.723
We had the funeral

01:13:15.757 --> 01:13:18.760
and afterwards I came home
and he'd gone.

01:13:18.793 --> 01:13:21.463
Bags were packed.

01:13:21.495 --> 01:13:24.365
I never saw him again.

01:13:50.357 --> 01:13:53.128
Do you-do you-
do you hear that?

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:55.163
Do you hear that?

01:13:59.867 --> 01:14:00.834
What is it?

01:14:00.868 --> 01:14:01.468
I'm not sure.

01:14:01.502 --> 01:14:02.971
I thought I saw something.

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:09.144
What is that?

01:14:10.511 --> 01:14:12.446
It's Ridley's camera!

01:14:16.350 --> 01:14:18.386
Ridley!

01:14:29.129 --> 01:14:31.165
Come in, this is Spencer. Over.

01:14:31.199 --> 01:14:32.267
<i>Go ahead, Spencer.</i>

01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:34.369
It looks like Ridley was here.
We found his camera.

01:14:34.401 --> 01:14:37.504
And it looks like he built
a fire.

01:14:37.538 --> 01:14:39.440
Ridley!

01:14:39.472 --> 01:14:43.177
<i>We're six miles
southwest of the quarry. Over.</i>

01:14:43.211 --> 01:14:44.412
<i>Copy that.
I'm on my way.</i>

01:14:44.445 --> 01:14:45.847
Copy that.

01:14:45.879 --> 01:14:48.182
He was here, Spencer!
He was here!

01:14:48.216 --> 01:14:49.984
The police are on their way.

01:14:50.016 --> 01:14:52.253
That's his fire pit, alright.

01:14:53.253 --> 01:14:55.390
He can't have gotten far.

01:15:27.989 --> 01:15:30.058
You have to be kidding me.

01:15:30.757 --> 01:15:33.126
Where do you think he's gone?

01:15:33.159 --> 01:15:36.396
Well, if he left the quarry
and ended up here,

01:15:36.430 --> 01:15:38.633
he's headed south.

01:15:38.665 --> 01:15:40.901
You think he's trying to get
back to Buckley's?

01:15:40.935 --> 01:15:45.240
Maybe. He's a strong lad.
This'll make him stronger.

01:15:45.272 --> 01:15:48.275
You can't have strength
without struggle.

01:15:48.575 --> 01:15:49.510
What did you say?

01:15:49.543 --> 01:15:51.312
Oh, it's just something
my dad used to say.

01:15:51.345 --> 01:15:53.013
I used to say it to Bryce.

01:15:53.047 --> 01:15:54.949
Why?

01:15:54.981 --> 01:15:56.551
No reason.

01:15:59.352 --> 01:16:00.254
He was here.

01:16:00.288 --> 01:16:01.321
He must have slept here.

01:16:01.355 --> 01:16:02.323
This is his camera.

01:16:02.355 --> 01:16:04.057
Did you see what was on it?

01:16:04.091 --> 01:16:06.394
Uh, we tried but the battery
is dead.

01:16:09.163 --> 01:16:11.098
What the hell is that?

01:16:17.204 --> 01:16:18.339
Stay there, mate!

01:16:18.372 --> 01:16:19.973
We'll come and get ya!

01:16:20.007 --> 01:16:21.209
You're a liar!

01:16:21.242 --> 01:16:23.578
No, no, no,
everyone's looking for ya!

01:16:23.610 --> 01:16:25.247
It's Ridley!

01:16:32.285 --> 01:16:34.122
I don't believe you!

01:16:34.154 --> 01:16:36.957
He's telling the truth,
you stupid kid!

01:16:36.990 --> 01:16:38.292
That's not helpful, mate.

01:16:38.325 --> 01:16:39.993
Oh.

01:16:40.026 --> 01:16:41.629
Sorry, mate!

01:16:43.698 --> 01:16:44.633
Come on.

01:16:44.665 --> 01:16:46.700
Let's just head to the bridge,
cross there,

01:16:46.734 --> 01:16:48.202
and get him on the other side.

01:16:48.235 --> 01:16:49.337
There's nowhere for him to go.

01:16:49.369 --> 01:16:52.006
Aye, what's up with that dingo?

01:16:52.038 --> 01:16:54.441
Oh, do you reckon that's
the one that you shot at?

01:16:54.475 --> 01:16:58.579
And missed by heaps?

01:16:58.611 --> 01:16:59.713
Yep.

01:16:59.747 --> 01:17:00.847
Just-whatever.

01:17:00.882 --> 01:17:02.951
Kid must have been right there
the whole bloody time.

01:17:02.984 --> 01:17:03.952
Yeah.

01:17:03.985 --> 01:17:05.220
Come on. Let's go.

01:17:11.124 --> 01:17:13.261
Where do you think
they're going?

01:17:16.129 --> 01:17:19.100
Would it kill you to have
an opinion once in a while?

01:17:27.475 --> 01:17:31.745
Water must lead us
to civilization, right?

01:17:31.779 --> 01:17:34.149
Can you swim?

01:17:44.458 --> 01:17:47.262
I thought you said
you could swim!

01:18:24.230 --> 01:18:26.700
We need to keep this between us.

01:18:26.734 --> 01:18:29.504
No one can know about this.

01:18:29.537 --> 01:18:33.408
If anyone asks, we've been
tending the hogs all day.

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:34.307
Yeah?

01:18:34.341 --> 01:18:35.810
Yeah.

01:18:35.842 --> 01:18:37.611
Ok.

01:18:37.645 --> 01:18:38.745
Come on.

01:18:38.779 --> 01:18:42.649
Let's just get back to the truck
before it's too dark.

01:18:53.159 --> 01:18:56.096
Let's have a look.

01:18:59.467 --> 01:19:01.469
Who's that?

01:19:02.069 --> 01:19:04.605
Bloody hell, that's Mick
and Oscar Wallace.

01:19:04.637 --> 01:19:06.540
They've got a hog farm
south of here.

01:19:06.574 --> 01:19:09.444
Those are the same men
that reported seeing Ridley.

01:19:09.476 --> 01:19:12.646
What are you bastards doing
at my farm?

01:19:14.481 --> 01:19:16.784
Ridley must have hidden
in the truck.

01:19:26.726 --> 01:19:29.596
Do you-do you think
they'd hurt Ridley?

01:19:29.629 --> 01:19:31.364
They may not be the best boys
or the smartest

01:19:31.397 --> 01:19:33.200
but they'd never hurt him.

01:19:33.234 --> 01:19:35.336
I think if we find Oscar
and Mick,

01:19:35.369 --> 01:19:36.671
I reckon we'll find Ridley.

01:19:36.704 --> 01:19:37.705
Attention all units.

01:19:37.739 --> 01:19:42.677
I need an APB out on a Mick
and Oscar Wallace.

01:19:42.709 --> 01:19:44.445
<i>Copy that, Madge.</i>

01:19:58.825 --> 01:20:00.595
Oh, sh-

01:20:07.568 --> 01:20:08.903
They've got Oscar and Mick
in custody.

01:20:08.936 --> 01:20:10.605
They've pretty much
told us everything.

01:20:10.637 --> 01:20:11.872
Did they see Ridley?

01:20:11.905 --> 01:20:14.274
They saw Ridley not more than
two hours ago down by the falls.

01:20:14.307 --> 01:20:15.510
Is he ok?

01:20:15.543 --> 01:20:17.512
They said he looked fine.

01:20:17.544 --> 01:20:19.279
Thank goodness.

01:20:20.346 --> 01:20:21.447
What else?

01:20:21.481 --> 01:20:23.417
Well, they said that when
they got to the other side

01:20:23.449 --> 01:20:25.153
of the river Ridley was gone

01:20:25.186 --> 01:20:28.189
and they fished one of his shoes
out of the water

01:20:28.221 --> 01:20:29.723
near the edge of the falls.

01:20:29.757 --> 01:20:31.759
We've already got a search crew
heading there now.

01:20:31.792 --> 01:20:33.261
Just because they found his shoe

01:20:33.293 --> 01:20:35.363
doesn't mean he went
over the falls.

01:20:35.395 --> 01:20:36.329
Come on.

01:20:36.363 --> 01:20:37.664
It's not far from here.

01:20:37.698 --> 01:20:39.467
Oh, wait.

01:20:39.499 --> 01:20:41.401
They said there was a dingo
with him.

01:20:41.435 --> 01:20:43.604
Do you guys know anything
about that?

01:20:43.637 --> 01:20:44.872
What?

01:20:44.904 --> 01:20:46.706
Yeah, I thought it was weird,
but they made a point of saying

01:20:46.739 --> 01:20:48.876
Ridley and the dingo
were travelling together.

01:20:48.909 --> 01:20:49.911
Are you sure?

01:20:49.944 --> 01:20:51.312
Yep.

01:20:51.345 --> 01:20:53.681
I asked them to repeat
that part.

01:22:51.565 --> 01:22:55.069
What have I always told you?

01:22:55.101 --> 01:22:58.738
If there's no struggle,
there's no strength.

01:22:58.771 --> 01:23:01.275
And don't forget it.

01:23:43.650 --> 01:23:45.753
Anything?

01:23:48.154 --> 01:23:53.427
We've got divers in the water.
They haven't found anything.

01:24:15.449 --> 01:24:17.051
Gloria, you need
to eat something.

01:24:17.083 --> 01:24:19.787
I- I don't want it.

01:24:19.820 --> 01:24:22.890
Gloria, you need to eat.

01:24:22.922 --> 01:24:24.925
I don't want a damn sandwich.

01:24:24.958 --> 01:24:26.727
Ok.

01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:28.428
It's ok, we're gonna find him.

01:24:28.462 --> 01:24:30.964
Stop telling me we're gonna
find him!

01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:34.602
Because we're not gonna
find him.

01:24:34.635 --> 01:24:35.503
We're gonna find him.

01:24:35.535 --> 01:24:36.736
We're not gonna find him!

01:24:36.770 --> 01:24:38.039
Come here.

01:24:38.605 --> 01:24:39.674
There.

01:24:40.007 --> 01:24:41.876
Ok. Ok.

01:26:06.726 --> 01:26:09.062
Dingo, you say?

01:26:09.096 --> 01:26:10.964
Yep.

01:26:10.998 --> 01:26:12.934
Dingo.

01:26:17.037 --> 01:26:20.507
Never seen a dingo
do that before.

01:26:33.086 --> 01:26:34.521
Ridley!

01:26:37.857 --> 01:26:39.226
Ridley!

01:26:42.729 --> 01:26:44.065
Oh! Ridley!

01:26:45.598 --> 01:26:47.267
Oh, Ridley.

01:26:58.044 --> 01:27:00.847
It's ok.

01:27:00.881 --> 01:27:02.749
I miss dad.

01:27:04.251 --> 01:27:06.954
I really miss him.

01:27:06.986 --> 01:27:08.722
I miss him, too.

01:27:39.186 --> 01:27:40.387
Come on, Spencer.

01:27:40.421 --> 01:27:43.257
If it's not about the money then
do it for the other farmers.

01:27:43.289 --> 01:27:45.325
It's getting harder
and harder, mate.

01:27:45.359 --> 01:27:46.660
Please.

01:27:46.693 --> 01:27:47.927
Reconsider selling.

01:27:47.961 --> 01:27:49.663
It's not my land.

01:27:49.695 --> 01:27:50.698
What're you talking about?

01:27:50.730 --> 01:27:51.965
I signed that portion
of my land

01:27:51.998 --> 01:27:55.668
over to Gloria and Ridley
two days ago.

01:27:55.702 --> 01:28:00.240
If you wanna convince someone
you best talk to her.

01:28:17.423 --> 01:28:19.959
Oh, good-good dingo.

01:28:19.993 --> 01:28:21.128
Buckley, be nice.

01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:22.163
Sit.

01:28:24.230 --> 01:28:25.832
Good boy.

01:28:27.333 --> 01:28:29.302
Sorry about your camera.

01:28:29.336 --> 01:28:31.105
Is it not working?

01:28:31.137 --> 01:28:32.405
It's stuffed.

01:28:32.439 --> 01:28:33.740
It's ok, though.

01:28:33.774 --> 01:28:36.110
The tech on phones now
is really good.

01:28:36.142 --> 01:28:37.711
I can shoot this in 4k.

01:28:37.744 --> 01:28:41.848
4k? Wow, that's incredible.

01:28:41.882 --> 01:28:43.317
You have no idea
what I'm talking about.

01:28:43.350 --> 01:28:44.651
No.

01:28:48.855 --> 01:28:52.793
How about you spend the next
two weeks mending these fences

01:28:52.825 --> 01:28:56.096
and we'll head into the city
and find you a new camera?

01:28:56.128 --> 01:28:57.997
- Really?
- Sure.

01:28:58.030 --> 01:29:00.167
You gotta do a good job, though.

01:29:00.199 --> 01:29:04.704
The tougher the job,
the tougher I get.

01:29:04.738 --> 01:29:08.342
No strength without struggle,
huh, grandpa?

01:29:08.374 --> 01:29:10.176
So we got a deal.

01:29:10.209 --> 01:29:11.845
You sure about this?

01:29:11.878 --> 01:29:14.014
Heard it can be a pain
in the arse.

01:29:18.985 --> 01:29:22.790
What do you say we get
this movie started?

01:29:22.823 --> 01:29:24.091
You got it.

01:29:24.123 --> 01:29:25.258
Come on.

01:29:26.092 --> 01:29:27.293
Come on.

01:29:30.396 --> 01:29:32.298
You're gonna make me look good,
right?

01:29:32.332 --> 01:29:33.700
Definitely.

01:29:33.734 --> 01:29:36.203
This'll be the best doco
you've ever seen.

01:29:48.214 --> 01:29:49.717
This is cool.

01:29:55.855 --> 01:29:57.023
Sit down for a second.

01:29:57.056 --> 01:29:58.458
I just need to sort
something out.

01:29:58.492 --> 01:29:59.927
Ok.

01:30:02.229 --> 01:30:04.498
Come on, Spencer.
Sit down.

01:30:04.530 --> 01:30:06.100
<i>What're you doing up there?</i>

01:30:13.006 --> 01:30:16.343
Uh, it's on?

01:30:16.376 --> 01:30:18.945
<i>You got it?
Am I in focus?</i>

I'm Bryce. My name is Bryce.

You can call me, Dad.

01:30:24.184 --> 01:30:25.186

<i>Give me a superhero pose,
Dad.</i>

Dear god.

I just said that.</i>

<i>You want me to do that
three times fast?</i>

<i>Can I have a look?</i>

01:31:15.968 --> 01:31:17.270
Buckley?

01:31:18.137 --> 01:31:19.539
Hey, where are you?

01:31:24.110 --> 01:31:25.780
Buckley?

01:31:48.501 --> 01:31:50.137
Oh.
