09:41.696 --> 09:43.399
It's just going to storage.

09:43.465 --> 09:45.036
Why would you want
to store that?

09:45.102 --> 09:47.574

so fragile?

09:47.641 --> 09:49.044
The fragility is the point.

09:49.110 --> 09:50.514

of the precious scars.

09:50.580 --> 09:51.415

I'm just being stupid.

No, you're being honest

We get territorial.

made you practice

‐Aw, thanks.

willingly gave up your seat

it's supposed to be.
