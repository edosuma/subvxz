WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:00.320
.

00:05.960 --> 00:07.520
The Geordies are back

00:07.600 --> 00:10.320
and we're leaving the Toon
and hitting Greece.

00:10.400 --> 00:12.920
Greece, you're about to get done.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.760
(cheering)

00:14.840 --> 00:16.320
Come on!

00:17.760 --> 00:19.360
It's gonna be pool parties.

00:19.440 --> 00:21.920
Boat parties.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.120
More drama.

00:24.520 --> 00:25.840
Fuck this shit!

00:27.680 --> 00:28.800
More tashing on.

00:31.680 --> 00:33.200
More fucking tragedy.

00:33.280 --> 00:35.560
(shouting)

00:37.040 --> 00:38.640
(sighs)

00:38.720 --> 00:41.160
Don't fucking ever
speak to me again.

00:44.360 --> 00:45.880
Total carnage.

00:48.520 --> 00:50.760
Fuck. Shit. What have I done now?

00:54.000 --> 00:55.800
And a shit load of bucking, like.

00:58.920 --> 01:03.480
Greece, the Geordie gods are coming.
Time to get immortal.

01:07.040 --> 01:09.080
We're in fucking Greece.

01:10.080 --> 01:11.560
Aaron.

01:11.640 --> 01:15.040
The pulling competition
is sending these two over the edge.

01:17.960 --> 01:19.880
You do not understand me!

01:19.960 --> 01:23.680
None of us know what's happening
with this Holly and Kyle situation.

01:23.760 --> 01:26.120
I fucking solid can understand you.

01:26.200 --> 01:28.520
Everything I do just seems wrong.

01:28.600 --> 01:31.360
Fuck this shit!
I'm not doing it any more, man!

01:31.440 --> 01:36.040
All you've talked about is Kyle!
Every minute of every day!

01:36.120 --> 01:39.160
It's all just kicking off.
Don't ever speak to me again.

01:39.240 --> 01:41.320
I never wanted it
to turn out like this.

01:41.400 --> 01:43.120
All I wanted was my best friend.

01:44.600 --> 01:47.360
Last night,
I was horny and wanting the finger.

01:47.440 --> 01:49.680
You can't catch feelings
on the finger.

01:53.160 --> 01:56.240
Scott reckons he's made
a pinky promise with Chloe.

01:56.320 --> 01:57.600
What a fucking wanker.

01:59.440 --> 02:01.640
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

02:01.720 --> 02:04.120
I'd never kiss anyone
without a six pack.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.720
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

02:06.800 --> 02:08.760
I'm gonna tear the place up.

02:08.840 --> 02:11.080
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

02:11.160 --> 02:12.800
I'm preened to perfection.

02:12.880 --> 02:15.000
I'm cheeky and full of mischief.

02:15.080 --> 02:16.840
I'm fit, flirty and I've got FFs.

02:16.920 --> 02:19.240
I'm gonna make sparks fly.

02:19.320 --> 02:21.960
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:30.280 --> 02:32.000
Tonight is Aaron's birthday,

02:32.080 --> 02:35.120
so we're getting ready
to hit Malia hard.

02:38.360 --> 02:41.280
Me and the girls
fucking cannot wait for tonight.

02:43.480 --> 02:45.640
I'm gonna get absolutely mortal.

02:45.720 --> 02:48.160
When I'm mortal,
I get horny as fuck.

02:48.240 --> 02:51.120
Chloe's saying that
she's gonna get fucking smashed.

02:51.200 --> 02:54.320
Let's hope she doesn't kick off
and ruin Aaron's birthday.

02:54.400 --> 02:57.640
Like, it's just...
No-one is having a lot of sex.

02:57.720 --> 03:01.040
Normally, when I walk in a bedroom
at the house in Newcastle,

03:01.120 --> 03:02.840
I smell a massive aroma of cum.

03:02.920 --> 03:05.160
But this time,
it hasn't happened once.

03:05.240 --> 03:07.120
It's just dead fresh and stuff.

03:07.200 --> 03:09.560
We need to change this.
This needs to stop.

03:09.640 --> 03:12.360
And I'm gonna make sure
that this starts tonight.

03:12.440 --> 03:15.200
Me and Kyle haven't been having
as much sex as usual,

03:15.280 --> 03:18.400
but tonight I will fight any fucker
for that shag pad.

03:21.760 --> 03:24.640
I can't wait to go fucking radge
on me birthday.

03:30.160 --> 03:34.320
Let's get this fucking party
started, bitches!

03:36.760 --> 03:40.000
We get in the club, and
it's bouncing. Let's get mortal.

03:42.760 --> 03:44.480
Tonight is gonna be proper epic

03:44.560 --> 03:47.400
cos tonight is all about pulling.
Waxer!

03:55.760 --> 04:00.480
It's not my fault we haven't banged.
We've had nowhere to have sex.

04:02.960 --> 04:06.240
I just don't feel as though
we're as close any more.

04:06.320 --> 04:08.480
I feel like
we're a boring couple now.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.840
So I pulled again,
and I brung a friend for Aaron.

04:17.920 --> 04:19.840
Happy fucking birthday, mate.

04:22.200 --> 04:24.600
This birthday just keeps
getting better.

04:24.680 --> 04:28.200
Me and Scott have pulled a bird each
and there's no arguing.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.840
(Chloe) Scott's pulled a girl.

04:31.920 --> 04:35.160
I'm not gonna kick off.
I'm gonna try to have a good time.

04:37.200 --> 04:41.240
Chloe's on a mission.
She is so keen to pull tonight.

04:41.320 --> 04:44.520
She does not want Scott
to make her look like a mug.

04:44.600 --> 04:45.920
And I've seen a fittie.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.320
Fucking hell,
he's kinda good-looking, you know.

04:49.400 --> 04:53.200
Yes! Chloe has pulled someone
and he's fit.

04:53.280 --> 04:54.800
I'm so fucking proud of her.

04:57.640 --> 04:59.760
Everyone's pulled again, bar me.

04:59.840 --> 05:03.320
That's because my standards
are up with the cream of the crop,

05:03.400 --> 05:05.400
not the fucking pit of the barrel.

05:09.240 --> 05:11.920
It's time to take this bird back

05:12.000 --> 05:14.440
and give her a blast
on me helter-skelter.

05:17.880 --> 05:20.280
I thought I was getting
some birthday cake,

05:20.360 --> 05:22.680
but I've just got a birthday pie.
Fuck off.

05:24.640 --> 05:28.240
Scott's the only one
who's managed to bring someone back.

05:28.320 --> 05:31.480
Let's hope that neither Aaron
or Chloe gets jealous over it.

05:31.560 --> 05:34.400
Shut the door, man.
Shut the door, man.

05:40.760 --> 05:43.120
We get back and everyone's mortal.

05:46.080 --> 05:48.120
Kyle and Holly
have got the shag pad,

05:48.200 --> 05:51.200
which is wicked cos
we can leave them to argue in peace.

05:51.280 --> 05:53.960
I have to take this bird
to some new terrain.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.080
This night turned out shit.
Scott's brought a girl back.

05:58.160 --> 05:59.200
All I want is me bed.

06:00.520 --> 06:04.520
Holly's in the shag pad, and Kyle's
more interested in making food.

06:04.600 --> 06:07.160
There's something not right here.

06:07.240 --> 06:08.920
Me and Charlotte decide

06:09.000 --> 06:12.800
we're gonna go and spy on Scott
banging his bird on the balcony.

06:18.440 --> 06:20.040
(both laugh)

06:24.560 --> 06:25.640
This is hilarious.

06:25.720 --> 06:28.480
Scott is shagging
and we're torturing him.

06:28.560 --> 06:30.320
This is almost as good as sex.

06:31.320 --> 06:32.360
Ha!

06:32.440 --> 06:34.120
Charlotte hoys a pillow down.

06:34.200 --> 06:37.120
Perfect timing.
She needs a bit of a neck support.

06:37.200 --> 06:39.600
Scott, it's the police.

06:39.680 --> 06:41.920
Holly's waiting for us
in the shag pad,

06:42.000 --> 06:43.760
but this is just too good to miss.

06:43.840 --> 06:46.960
Scott, you're under arrest
for shit shagging.

06:48.240 --> 06:51.680
Just cos you're jealous
it's not you, Charlotte.

06:51.760 --> 06:54.360
Instead of dicking Holly
in the shag pad,

06:54.440 --> 06:57.040
Kyle's dicking around with me
outside,

06:57.120 --> 07:00.880
watching Scott dig a random girl.
Dickhead.

07:00.960 --> 07:03.280
Enough of seeing Scott
get his end away.

07:03.360 --> 07:06.160
I'm gonna put this shag pad
through its paces.

07:08.480 --> 07:10.400
(Holly)Finally, Kyle has arrived.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.840
I don't know what he's been doing,

07:12.920 --> 07:14.880
but finally I can hop on the cock
now.

07:14.960 --> 07:17.760
(moans)

07:21.800 --> 07:24.880
Sunlight's just beaming through
on me face,

07:24.960 --> 07:28.280
so I decide to fuck this off
and go and sleep with the lads.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.480
I've waited for hours
while he's pissed about.

07:35.560 --> 07:38.080
We finally have sex
and now he wants to leave.

07:38.160 --> 07:41.240
He's treating me
like a one night stand.

07:44.840 --> 07:47.880
The reason Holly's saying that
is to get a bite out of us.

07:52.560 --> 07:54.480
There's no fucking next time.

07:56.800 --> 07:59.360
Who would have sex
with their girlfriend

07:59.440 --> 08:01.480
and then walk out and leave them?

08:06.600 --> 08:09.520
When he treats me like this,
I feel used and rejected.

08:09.600 --> 08:10.840
Does he just not get it?

08:15.680 --> 08:18.840
Once again, he's made me feel
completely worthless.

08:31.640 --> 08:34.360
How come you're here?
I thought it was Kyle's night.

08:34.440 --> 08:36.840
It was supposed to be
Holly and Kyle's night,

08:36.920 --> 08:38.960
but she's woken up
in the girls' room.

08:39.040 --> 08:42.080
Something doesn't make sense.
It never does with them.

08:42.160 --> 08:44.640
Well, it was Kyle's night
so we still had sex.

08:44.720 --> 08:46.240
We were trying to get to sleep

08:46.320 --> 08:48.640
and the sun was blaring through
the thingy.

08:48.720 --> 08:50.160
So he went downstairs.

08:50.240 --> 08:53.720
Last night, not only did I get
a bang, but I also had an audience.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.680
I bet they enjoyed the show.

08:55.760 --> 08:58.160
Scott,
me and Charlotte seen you shagging.

08:58.240 --> 09:01.520
Fuck me, it was like you were
putting her through the balcony.

09:01.600 --> 09:02.760
Smashing the chair.

09:02.840 --> 09:05.960
Scott picked a very public place
to have sex.

09:06.040 --> 09:08.040
Me and Kyle couldn't help but watch.

09:08.120 --> 09:10.760
It's weird, the way he has sex.
It's like...

09:10.840 --> 09:13.240
You know how normal people would,
like...

09:14.920 --> 09:18.640
Like a boy would thrust up and down,
he goes round.

09:18.720 --> 09:20.640
Yeah.
I've seen him do that before.

09:20.720 --> 09:22.960
Yeah, he's done that with me.
It's shit.

09:23.040 --> 09:25.320
Er, that's awful.
It's shit.

09:25.400 --> 09:27.760
That's exactly why
I never went there.

09:27.840 --> 09:30.960
Who does he think he is?
That technique was shit.

09:31.040 --> 09:33.960
I know, deep down,
if I'd seen him shagging that girl,

09:34.040 --> 09:35.560
I'd be heartbroken.

09:43.240 --> 09:46.040
I'm still thinking about
me argument with Holly.

09:46.120 --> 09:47.800
I don't know what to do any more.

09:49.880 --> 09:52.640
Yeah, I know, mate.
I couldn't even sleep in there.

09:54.960 --> 09:57.360
Dip, do one. Smash, gnash.

09:57.440 --> 10:00.840
That's what you do, Kyle, to
a random bird, not your girlfriend.

10:00.920 --> 10:05.520
And then we ended up arguing cos
she said it was her night with me.

10:10.120 --> 10:12.000
Kyle's head is all over the place.

10:12.080 --> 10:13.920
I wanna have a laugh with the lads.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.560
I do get jealous
of them pulling sometimes.

10:16.640 --> 10:20.520
I shouldn't be getting ground down
every night by stupid arguments.

10:20.600 --> 10:23.520
I'm only young.
I should be pulling with the lads.

10:30.120 --> 10:34.080
I need to talk to Charlotte about
last night. I'm still feeling crap.

10:34.160 --> 10:37.440
We'd gone to bed, we'd had sex,
and we'd laid there for a bit.

10:37.520 --> 10:40.240
Then he was like,
"I'm gonna go to the boys' room."

10:40.320 --> 10:43.880
Holly got piped by her own boyfriend.
This is bad.

10:43.960 --> 10:45.880
It felt like massive rejection.

10:45.960 --> 10:48.480
Kyle never understands
why I'm hurt or upset.

10:48.560 --> 10:50.360
Every girl wants to be cuddled.

10:50.440 --> 10:53.040
Best part about having a boyfriend
is cuddles.

10:56.640 --> 10:58.880
I won't tell no-one.
OK, good.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.840
(phone ringing)

11:06.560 --> 11:08.000
Shit.

11:08.080 --> 11:11.160
I hope it's not Anna.
I can't be arsed with work today.

11:11.240 --> 11:12.640
Hi, Anna. You all right?

11:15.840 --> 11:16.880
We're going back?

11:16.960 --> 11:19.880
I'm buzzing. We're going back
to Zante. I might pull.

11:23.280 --> 11:25.800
OK. Bye, Anna.

11:27.720 --> 11:30.080
We're going back to Zante.
Pack your bags.

11:34.480 --> 11:36.440
We're off to the airport. Buzzing.

11:41.680 --> 11:43.400
Malia, done and dusted.

11:49.120 --> 11:50.800
Zante. Time for round two.

11:51.840 --> 11:55.480
Back in Zante, we're going straight
to a boat party. Fucking mint.

11:57.840 --> 12:01.840
We're going to a party!
P-A-R-T-E-Y.

12:02.760 --> 12:04.280
Boat party!

12:08.400 --> 12:10.080
The boat is looking sick.

12:10.160 --> 12:13.160
I've got a feeling that
this is gonna be an amazing day.

12:13.240 --> 12:14.840
Everybody, top deck.

12:14.920 --> 12:16.600
(all cheer)

12:23.480 --> 12:27.480
I am getting on it.
Try and stop me now, bitches!

12:35.600 --> 12:39.480
Been on this boat five minutes and
I've got a bird all hands on dick.

12:39.560 --> 12:42.160
Chloe looks like
she's gonna hoy us overboard.

12:44.160 --> 12:48.440
Seeing Scott actually pulling this
girl, it's made me really jealous.

12:55.800 --> 12:58.720
I can't believe I have to wear
the shit orange jacket.

12:58.800 --> 13:02.760
No boy would be interested in a girl
who looks like a giant orange shit.

13:07.920 --> 13:10.920
I look around the boat
and everyone's having a mint time.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.840
And I'm just stuck with Holly.
Things are still weird between wuh.

13:16.200 --> 13:17.360
Are you all right?

13:24.400 --> 13:25.800
I'm meant to be having fun,

13:25.880 --> 13:28.880
but I'm stuck in a corner
talking about me relationship.

13:28.960 --> 13:30.600
I'm too young for this, like.

13:30.680 --> 13:33.840
Like, do you wanna be out there
pulling with the lads?

13:33.920 --> 13:36.480
I know that me and Kyle
have been arguing a lot,

13:36.560 --> 13:39.840
but he loves me and our relationship
is worth fighting for.

13:49.720 --> 13:51.440
I care about Holly so much,

13:51.520 --> 13:54.800
but the more I think about it,
I'm just not happy.

13:58.160 --> 14:01.440
(Chloe) I look over,
he's having the time of his life.

14:01.520 --> 14:04.240
Fuck it,
I wanna cock block him to fuck.

14:06.600 --> 14:08.280
Er... No.

14:09.600 --> 14:14.120
Scottie's pulled, and surprise,
surprise, Chloe's kicked off. Shock.

14:29.240 --> 14:32.680
Chloe's mortal and she's kicking off
and making loads of noise.

14:32.760 --> 14:35.560
(screams)
Hold it! Hold it.

14:35.640 --> 14:38.080
Chlo! Chlo! Chlo! Chlo! Chlo!

14:39.600 --> 14:42.960
(Nathan)Chloe's getting annoyed
at Scott for pulling girls.

14:43.040 --> 14:44.600
If you like him, tell him.

14:44.680 --> 14:46.520
But maybes not in that jacket.

14:56.560 --> 14:59.520
My head's been all over the place
these past few days,

14:59.600 --> 15:02.520
but I've come to a decision
and I've gotta tell someone.

15:12.560 --> 15:14.560
This isn't a massive surprise.

15:18.320 --> 15:19.920
I'm not gonna be with Holly.

15:25.280 --> 15:27.320
I've been in Kyle's position before,

15:27.400 --> 15:31.080
but he got pressured into getting
in a relationship, and I didn't.

15:31.160 --> 15:33.600
I did what I wanted to do.
That was bang birds.

15:33.680 --> 15:35.280
That's what Kyle wants to do.

15:43.360 --> 15:46.600
This boat party's absolutely mint.
I'm off me fucking tree.

15:48.440 --> 15:49.960
Scott's brought a girl back.

15:50.040 --> 15:52.760
Chloe is paralytic.
What could possibly go wrong?

15:59.640 --> 16:01.000
I'm absolutely mortal.

16:01.080 --> 16:04.240
And seeing him with this girl
is making me so angry.

16:05.840 --> 16:09.760
Chloe is on one. She's kicking off
left, right and centre.

16:09.840 --> 16:10.840
(screams)

16:10.920 --> 16:12.720
Maybe she doesn't like boats.

16:12.800 --> 16:16.000
(shouts)

16:16.080 --> 16:18.800
I'm arguing with
every single person on the boat.

16:18.880 --> 16:21.480
Listen, listen.
Who do you think you are?

16:21.560 --> 16:22.760
Fuck's sake.

16:25.520 --> 16:29.080
Everyone's having a wicked day
and then Chloe kicks off.

16:29.160 --> 16:32.520
Scott will pull every day.
She's just his backup plan.

16:32.600 --> 16:34.480
Chlo, Chlo, Chlo, Chlo...

16:34.560 --> 16:36.680
I'm trying to help her.
Fucking idiot.

16:36.760 --> 16:39.360
Chloe kicking off
has ruined the vibe.

16:39.440 --> 16:42.440
I think it's about time
I got on some dry land.

16:42.520 --> 16:45.600
I think I'm feeling a bit seasick.
Or it could be the vodka.

16:48.720 --> 16:51.160
Who the fuck are you to say...

16:51.240 --> 16:53.640
I don't even remember
getting off the boat,

16:53.720 --> 16:55.720
and now I'm arguing with Holly.

17:02.720 --> 17:04.680
How dare she even say
that I was a slag?

17:04.760 --> 17:07.480
How would she know
what the hell's gone on in my life?

17:07.560 --> 17:11.240
I'm a slag.
You wanna get out of this car now.

17:11.320 --> 17:13.280
Chloe said it in the wrong way,

17:13.360 --> 17:16.760
but everyone did like Holly better
when she wasn't with Kyle.

17:23.640 --> 17:25.240
This is really awkward,

17:25.320 --> 17:29.080
because me and Marnie do quite agree
with some of what Chloe is saying.

17:29.160 --> 17:31.000
For you to turn around and say to me

17:31.080 --> 17:33.480
that my boyfriend
doesn't wanna be with us.

17:33.560 --> 17:37.120
That is wrong. No, it's fine.
I'm actually gonna get out now.

17:37.200 --> 17:39.360
Holly got out of the taxi
and comes over.

17:39.440 --> 17:41.440
I know for a fact
this cannot be good.

17:41.520 --> 17:44.040
Literally she has just kicked off
with me.

17:44.120 --> 17:47.360
Starts basically saying
that you don't care about us,

17:47.440 --> 17:49.000
and that you moaned to her

17:49.080 --> 17:52.440
that you basically don't give a shit
about me. No, no, no, no.

17:52.520 --> 17:55.480
What the fuck
are you telling her that for?

17:55.560 --> 17:58.520
Why are you telling her
I don't care? Of course I care.

17:58.600 --> 18:00.400
(both shout)

18:00.480 --> 18:04.200
Chloe needs to shut the fuck up.
First of all, I do care about Holly.

18:04.280 --> 18:07.280
Second, how does she know
I'm gonna finish with her?

18:07.360 --> 18:10.520
I care about her so much.
You're a fucking idiot, man.

18:10.600 --> 18:14.080
You're a little kid and you need
to be put on the naughty step.

18:14.160 --> 18:17.280
Naughty step?
And then what you gonna do, Kyle?

18:17.360 --> 18:20.680
Take away her pocket money
and send her to bed with no dinner?

18:20.760 --> 18:23.080
Chloe, right,
get in the fucking taxi now.

18:23.160 --> 18:25.920
I've caught up with Chloe
to try and calm her down.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.800
I don't want her
to go through any trouble.

18:28.880 --> 18:31.160
But she was kind of in the wrong.

18:31.240 --> 18:32.920
Just get in and shut up.

18:34.120 --> 18:36.600
Thank you. Fucking hell.

18:36.680 --> 18:39.880
I'm here to fucking tell yous
how it fucking is, right?

18:39.960 --> 18:41.320
But why...

18:41.400 --> 18:45.040
If anyone's bitchy to me,
I will not stand for it!

18:46.680 --> 18:49.840
It was like, "How do you know
about me and my boyfriend?"

18:51.080 --> 18:54.440
I told someone how exactly I feel.
It was totally fucking right.

18:58.480 --> 18:59.840
We get back to the house.

18:59.920 --> 19:02.320
Holly is still
foaming her nut off at Chloe.

19:02.400 --> 19:05.480
She said that everybody preferred me
when I was a slag,

19:05.560 --> 19:06.680
because I was real.

19:06.760 --> 19:08.880
(Charlotte)But Chloe
did have a point.

19:08.960 --> 19:11.920
You were much more fun
when you had a cock in your mouth.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.080
Then she brought Kyle into it.
You've done fuck all wrong.

19:15.160 --> 19:18.840
She said, "He doesn't give a fuck
about you, and everyone says that."

19:18.920 --> 19:22.200
Just shut the fuck up, Holly.
You're making it worse.

19:22.280 --> 19:26.640
"He doesn't give a fuck about you.
I'll tell you cos I'm your friend."

19:26.720 --> 19:29.080
Yous two just need
to fucking split up.

19:29.160 --> 19:32.720
Don't ever, ever talk to me
like that.

19:32.800 --> 19:36.080
Me and Marnie have been stuck
with Chloe.

19:36.160 --> 19:37.880
At least we're back at the villa.

19:37.960 --> 19:39.600
Here they are.
Ow!

19:39.680 --> 19:41.920
Everyone duck, they're coming.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.520
Hide me, hide me!

19:46.560 --> 19:48.680
I've just got in
and I'm fucking mortal.

19:48.760 --> 19:50.640
I wanna grab a pint of milk,

19:50.720 --> 19:53.040
then I'm gonna cuddle up
next to Scott.

19:57.440 --> 20:01.360
I know I need to apologise to Holly,
but I can barely get me words out.

20:04.760 --> 20:07.920
Chloe,
in her drunken mess of a state,

20:08.000 --> 20:11.040
is trying to apologise with
a fucking smirk on her face.

20:11.120 --> 20:13.520
I'll talk to you
when you're being sincere.

20:13.600 --> 20:14.920
No, I am being sincere.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.600
Right, well, that apology was shit.

20:18.880 --> 20:20.120
Wanna make some food?

20:23.120 --> 20:27.360
Going to bed. Out every weekend.

20:27.440 --> 20:30.720
I was looking forward to the boat
party. It's been a disaster.

20:30.800 --> 20:34.080
I'm gonna lie here,
pass out and go to sleep.

20:35.080 --> 20:38.200
(Gaz)It looks like
nothing's gonna get sorted tonight.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.600
Everyone needs to get some food,
get to bed

20:40.680 --> 20:43.480
and hopefully
everything will be sorted tomorrow.

21:03.080 --> 21:04.480
Chloe was on one yesterday

21:04.560 --> 21:07.600
and it ended up getting her
in trouble with everyone.

21:07.680 --> 21:10.840
But in the end, it mainly boiled down
to her and Holly.

21:10.920 --> 21:14.080
You said, "Look, you've changed now."

21:14.160 --> 21:16.840
"Everyone preferred you
when you were a slag."

21:16.920 --> 21:19.440
You said,
"Kyle doesn't wanna be with you."

21:19.520 --> 21:20.800
No, I didn't.
You did.

21:20.880 --> 21:21.880
Oh, my God.

21:21.960 --> 21:25.400
I should be barred from booze
and boats for the rest of me life.

21:25.480 --> 21:28.840
Got a bit angry about Scott's girl.
No, oh, nah.

21:28.920 --> 21:31.240
You said,
"So you gonna suck him off, then?"

21:31.320 --> 21:34.640
And then she went, "I don't know,
why? Have you shagged him?"

21:34.720 --> 21:36.560
You went, "Yeah, he's shit."

21:36.640 --> 21:38.080
(both laugh)

21:38.160 --> 21:41.760
The reason I got pissed off
last night is because Scott pulled.

21:41.840 --> 21:44.640
I know I say I don't care,
but I do, I really like him.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.520
I couldn't handle it last night.

21:56.800 --> 21:58.680
Yesterday was fucking off it.

21:58.760 --> 22:01.800
Honestly, I don't really know
where it all went wrong.

22:01.880 --> 22:05.440
I wasn't even involved in
any of the arguments on the boat.

22:05.520 --> 22:07.280
She's just a silly little girl.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.800
Last night for me
was a massive head fuck.

22:09.880 --> 22:13.040
The fact is,
it's just not working here.

22:13.120 --> 22:15.760
How dare she even use that word
towards me?

22:15.840 --> 22:19.040
I know this shouldn't have hurt me,
but it fucking did.

22:19.120 --> 22:21.280
I'm sick of it being brought up, man.

22:21.360 --> 22:22.760
I can't believe this.

22:22.840 --> 22:25.680
All Kyle's worried about
is how it makes him look.

22:25.760 --> 22:29.080
Are you having a laugh?
I'm sick of it being brought up.

22:29.160 --> 22:31.320
Fucking joke. You're a fucking joke.

22:31.400 --> 22:32.960
I'm going.
What?

22:33.040 --> 22:36.800
Fuck this. I'm not gonna sit here
and argue with her, again.

22:36.880 --> 22:39.360
This is exactly why I wanna end it.

22:52.640 --> 22:53.760
Fuck's sake, man!

22:55.760 --> 22:59.480
Holly and Kyle are at it again.
Do these two ever fucking stop?

22:59.560 --> 23:01.480
Why are we arguing right now?

23:03.480 --> 23:05.920
Stop pushing me away, for one. Yeah?

23:07.440 --> 23:09.960
I deserve a bit more than that,
do you not think?

23:10.040 --> 23:12.400
Kyle told me
he was gonna finish with Holly.

23:12.480 --> 23:15.760
By the sounds of that, it looks
like he hasn't changed his mind.

23:19.320 --> 23:20.880
(phone ringing)

23:28.040 --> 23:29.040
Boss.

23:29.120 --> 23:31.360
The phone rings and it's Anna.
Buzzing.

23:31.440 --> 23:34.040
I love hearing
what that bint has to tell us.

23:35.320 --> 23:36.480
Aye, how you doing?

23:42.280 --> 23:44.760
Wahey! Who's going?

23:44.840 --> 23:48.000
It better not be me,
cos I'm too hungover to do anything.

23:50.040 --> 23:51.760
Right, see you. Bye-bye.

23:51.840 --> 23:53.800
Me, Chloe and Nathan
are at work.

23:53.880 --> 23:57.480
Last night, Chloe kicked off again.
It does make it a bit awkward.

23:57.560 --> 23:58.840
People at work today...

23:58.920 --> 24:02.640
You, you and me.
(Charlotte)Yes!

24:02.720 --> 24:05.480
Get in! See you later, fuckers.

24:07.160 --> 24:08.720
I'm pissed that I'm working,

24:08.800 --> 24:11.040
but I'm more pissed off
I'm with Scott.

24:11.120 --> 24:14.000
I'm trying to avoid him.
What the hell am I gonna do?

24:15.080 --> 24:17.200
Anna's said
that we need wuh snorkels,

24:17.280 --> 24:20.960
but if Chloe kicks off, I'm
gonna stuff mine reet up her arse.

24:28.640 --> 24:31.120
(Kyle) I'm not going back
on what I told Gaz.

24:31.200 --> 24:32.880
I am gonna finish with Holly.

24:32.960 --> 24:34.920
I just need to figure out
how to do it.

24:39.400 --> 24:42.200
All right, Hol?
Yeah. How are you?

24:42.280 --> 24:44.520
Kyle said
he was gonna finish with Holly,

24:44.600 --> 24:48.120
but please tell me he is not gonna
do it right here, right now.

24:48.200 --> 24:50.960
Erm... Do you wanna go for a drink?
Yeah.

24:51.040 --> 24:53.400
Me and Kyle have
still got a lot to talk about.

24:53.480 --> 24:56.240
Having time away from this house
will do us a favour.

24:56.320 --> 24:57.800
Do I have time to get ready?

24:57.880 --> 25:01.040
Get ready. We'll stick some stuff on,
then we'll go.

25:01.120 --> 25:02.160
Sound.

25:03.600 --> 25:06.880
This isn't gonna be easy.
But it's gotta be done.

25:16.120 --> 25:20.360
Hi, guys.
Welcome to Tashos Touros. Come on.

25:20.440 --> 25:21.680
We've just got to work.

25:21.760 --> 25:24.800
I want to do a really good job
to make up for last night.

25:24.880 --> 25:27.720
I'm just gonna ignore Scott.

25:27.800 --> 25:31.520
It's time to get this party started.
This game is diving for dicks.

25:31.600 --> 25:34.320
It's all about getting that dick
out the tub,

25:34.400 --> 25:37.280
and putting it in your mouth.
This is my type of game.

25:37.360 --> 25:40.640
Why you putting the snorkel
in your mouth, idiot?Fuck off.

25:40.720 --> 25:44.640
I'm trying to ignore Scott, but it's
really hard. I fancy him so much.

25:44.720 --> 25:46.240
Go.

25:46.320 --> 25:49.120
I'm doing a demonstration,
which is strange.

25:49.200 --> 25:51.960
Normally it's everyone else
diving for my dick.

25:52.040 --> 25:54.280
Go.
Go on! Go on!

25:54.360 --> 25:56.440
Get that dick in your mouth.

25:56.520 --> 25:59.280
She could do it if it was mine.
You can do it! Come on!

25:59.360 --> 26:02.520
Come on, get your fucking cock
in your mouth!

26:02.600 --> 26:03.840
(laughs)

26:03.920 --> 26:05.440
We won!
Well done, guys.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.960
You're shit. You're shit.
You're shit.

26:08.040 --> 26:11.200
Guys, I hope you've had a good time,
but we need to bounce.

26:11.280 --> 26:13.240
I've had a pure wicked time at work.

26:13.320 --> 26:15.960
Chloe hasn't kicked off.
Fucking winner.

26:16.040 --> 26:18.120
Get your ass in the car.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.800
I've had a great day with Nathan
and Scott, but I need to apologise.

26:22.880 --> 26:24.600
I was so out of order last night.

26:24.680 --> 26:26.440
I'm sorry for last night, Scott.

26:26.520 --> 26:29.120
I never ever would want
to stop you from pulling.

26:29.200 --> 26:32.560
You know why I stayed? Cos
you're my Scott in the house. OK?

26:32.640 --> 26:36.000
You're my Scott. OK?

26:36.080 --> 26:39.960
Fuck. I'm getting carried away.
So much for playing it cool.

26:40.040 --> 26:42.480
They're fucking embarrassing.

26:48.960 --> 26:51.600
Hello.
Oy-oy.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.440
So where you going, Hols?

27:00.520 --> 27:02.560
Kyle's just asked us
to go for a drink.

27:02.640 --> 27:06.360
Have you spoke?
Well, we've not really spoke, nah.

27:06.440 --> 27:09.320
Me and Kyle haven't
properly sorted things out.

27:09.400 --> 27:11.800
Hopefully,
we can finally resolve things.

27:11.880 --> 27:14.000
Maybe it's good
to get out the house,

27:14.080 --> 27:17.000
where no-one's around
and yous can talk, just yous two.

27:17.080 --> 27:19.680
I really hope
that Holly and Kyle sort this out,

27:19.760 --> 27:23.440
because all I can see happening
is they get drunk, they argue again

27:23.520 --> 27:26.200
and then everything's
in a shit place for all of us.

27:26.280 --> 27:29.080
Imagine if he finished us?
God, don't say that.

27:29.160 --> 27:33.360
That'd be hilarious. I'd be like,
"Well, girls, I'm single".

27:33.440 --> 27:36.200
I don't know why I'm worrying.
It's gonna be fine.

27:36.280 --> 27:40.040
It'd be a bit pathetic if it was to
end over a stupid little argument.

27:40.120 --> 27:41.640
I'm sure we'll be fine.

27:41.720 --> 27:43.920
I'll tell you about it later.
Right, OK.

27:56.200 --> 27:58.760
The way things have been going
recently,

27:58.840 --> 28:01.720
I can't see any other way
than having to break up.

28:03.240 --> 28:04.320
Bye.

28:04.400 --> 28:07.080
Nothing we argue over
is big enough to break up for.

28:07.160 --> 28:10.720
We're gonna be able to make it
through this, no matter what.

28:16.640 --> 28:19.520
You think last night kicked off?

28:20.360 --> 28:23.200
Holly and Kyle haven't gone
for a romantic meal.

28:23.280 --> 28:24.720
Where have they gone?

28:24.800 --> 28:27.960
Kyle is going to finish Holly.
Shut up, man.

28:28.040 --> 28:31.680
Kyle is gonna break up with Holly,
and I feel pretty bad for her.

28:31.760 --> 28:35.200
If he isn't happy... We could
all tell that he's not happy.

28:35.280 --> 28:40.680
It's best to do now before it gets
too... more and more serious.

28:40.760 --> 28:43.880
I was like,
"Look, the harder it's gonna get."

28:43.960 --> 28:46.840
If Kyle's stayed true to his word
and finished Holly,

28:46.920 --> 28:50.360
tonight will either be full of tears
or World War fucking Three.

28:59.160 --> 29:02.040
Oh, God.
Drink!

29:08.360 --> 29:11.480
We get to the bar and I'm so nervous.

29:14.920 --> 29:17.120
I can't even look at Holly
in the face,

29:17.200 --> 29:19.160
cos I know what I'm about to do.

29:19.240 --> 29:21.800
I'm sorry about this morning.

29:21.880 --> 29:26.200
Er... Like, I genuinely am.

29:29.920 --> 29:33.520
I love you more than any other person
I've ever met in my life.

29:38.640 --> 29:42.280
There's something on his mind, but
I'm just not sure what it is yet.

29:42.360 --> 29:43.800
But...

29:45.160 --> 29:47.840
But I can't put you through this
any more.

29:47.920 --> 29:49.000
What?

29:49.080 --> 29:51.040
I can't put you through this
any more.

29:51.120 --> 29:54.120
I'm literally breaking your heart
every fucking night.

29:58.200 --> 30:00.000
So you're breaking up with us?

30:03.360 --> 30:04.600
Yeah.

30:05.440 --> 30:06.560
He's ended it.

30:06.640 --> 30:09.760
(cries) After everything
that we've been through.

30:11.480 --> 30:14.480
If we break up,
we can never get back together.

30:14.560 --> 30:18.200
It's making me feel as though
everything that we've been through

30:18.280 --> 30:19.960
is completely pointless.

30:20.040 --> 30:22.160
I know things are bad,
I know they are.

30:22.240 --> 30:24.560
But yesterday,
when we were on that boat,

30:24.640 --> 30:30.200
you sat there and you obviously
told me a massive bunch of lies.

30:31.560 --> 30:34.360
In the long term,
this is better for both of wuh.

30:37.000 --> 30:41.560
Why? Why is it so difficult?
Why can't we make it through?

30:43.200 --> 30:45.560
You are...
Honestly, I am being serious here

30:45.640 --> 30:47.960
and this is from
the bottom of my heart.

30:48.040 --> 30:51.320
You're the right person for me,
but it's the wrong time.

30:51.400 --> 30:53.960
It's the wrong time for both of us.

30:54.040 --> 30:57.160
This is really hard for us,
but we argue too much.

30:57.240 --> 30:59.880
And this is the only option
for wuh now.

31:03.200 --> 31:06.920
Every single night I'm gonna have
to watch him having fun.

31:07.000 --> 31:10.240
If he gets with anybody else,
it's gonna break my heart,

31:10.320 --> 31:14.480
but I don't know how my heart could
possibly broken any more than it is.

31:46.200 --> 31:47.720
He's ended it.

31:47.800 --> 31:50.680
(cries) After everything
that we've been through.

31:55.840 --> 31:58.120
All I wanna do right now
is see the girls,

31:58.200 --> 32:01.760
because I know
they're gonna make us feel better.

32:01.840 --> 32:03.000
You all right, Hols?

32:03.080 --> 32:06.440
Holly's back from her drinks
with Kyle, alone.

32:06.520 --> 32:08.160
What the hell's happened?

32:12.320 --> 32:13.920
(cries)

32:14.000 --> 32:16.680
We all moaned about
Holly and Kyle's arguments,

32:16.760 --> 32:19.320
but I don't think
we stopped to realise

32:19.400 --> 32:23.480
just how in love she is with that
boy. This is her world crashing.

32:29.320 --> 32:33.040
I never thought that I'd have to tell
the girls that we had broken up.

32:33.120 --> 32:37.960
He said
that he can't hurt us any more.

32:39.400 --> 32:41.080
And that he loves us so much,

32:41.160 --> 32:43.720
but he just can't see
another way through it.

32:43.800 --> 32:46.280
I thought that we were strong.

32:46.360 --> 32:50.000
How can two people who love each
other so much just not make it work?

32:50.080 --> 32:53.200
She's heartbroken. All us girls
need to be there for her.

32:53.280 --> 32:56.200
Sometimes it just doesn't work
and you can't make it.

32:56.280 --> 32:57.880
You can't try any longer.

32:57.960 --> 33:00.480
You couldn't have
been a better girlfriend.

33:00.560 --> 33:04.520
When you get dumped, you get fucked,
don't you? Let's do some shots.

33:04.600 --> 33:06.840
I don't know
how the hell I'm doing this,

33:06.920 --> 33:10.560
but I'm single and single girls
go out and get fucked.

33:27.520 --> 33:29.800
He's literally just got out
of the taxi.

33:33.160 --> 33:35.920
Where the fuck's the wine?

33:36.000 --> 33:37.640
Fuck me. That was bad, like.

33:37.720 --> 33:40.680
Kyle's telling us that
he's just broke up with Holly.

33:40.760 --> 33:41.960
I'm part of the lads,

33:42.040 --> 33:45.320
but I can't help feeling,
"What is Holly going through?"

33:52.840 --> 33:53.840
Yeah.

33:57.920 --> 34:01.800
These four lads can be dickheads,
but they're being really supportive.

34:01.880 --> 34:05.400
They're like brothers to us,
and I'm massively appreciative.

34:06.760 --> 34:08.880
It's gonna be hard
in the next few weeks.

34:08.960 --> 34:12.200
It's gonna be shit, but
I've got to put myself through it.

34:19.920 --> 34:21.800
Girls!

34:23.680 --> 34:26.080
I can't even look Kyle in the eye
right now.

34:26.160 --> 34:28.760
All I wanna do is get in the taxi,
get to the club

34:28.840 --> 34:31.520
and avoid him
as much as I possibly can.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.600
We've got to the club.
It's so awkward.

34:47.680 --> 34:50.040
You could cut the tension
with a knife.

34:53.080 --> 34:54.800
I do feel sorry for Holly.

34:54.880 --> 34:58.240
She's in a club with the person
who has just dumped her.

35:03.400 --> 35:05.520
I don't even know
why I'm here tonight.

35:05.600 --> 35:08.640
This is the worst night out
I've had in my entire life,

35:08.720 --> 35:10.760
and all I want is to be left alone.

35:14.720 --> 35:16.520
It's a bit of a weird situation,

35:16.600 --> 35:19.320
being on a night out
with your ex-girlfriend.

35:19.400 --> 35:21.480
But I just want to make sure
she's OK.

35:23.280 --> 35:27.440
So Kyle has gone over to Holly.
Is he having a laugh?

35:29.320 --> 35:31.680
Kyle's saying
he doesn't know what to do.

35:33.520 --> 35:36.600
I don't fucking know what to do,
Kyle. You finished it.

35:39.720 --> 35:41.640
This is getting so awkward.

35:43.640 --> 35:47.440
Kyle's just spoke to Holly. I'm now
gonna have to see if she's OK.

35:55.680 --> 35:59.440
I can't be here and watch him
have a good time. I'm heartbroken.

36:01.040 --> 36:03.200
Holly is in bits.
I don't blame her.

36:03.280 --> 36:05.720
If I'd gone through
what she's gone through,

36:05.800 --> 36:08.080
I certainly would not
be dancing in a club.

36:10.040 --> 36:13.240
I can't be in this club
with the boy who just broke my heart.

36:13.320 --> 36:14.760
I need to go home.

36:30.280 --> 36:33.280
Holly's gone and
I'm actually a little bit relieved.

36:33.360 --> 36:36.640
I feel like I can relax now
and actually enjoy my night.

36:38.440 --> 36:40.520
I know that Marnie's got a boyfriend.

36:40.600 --> 36:42.440
But if she was to break up with him,

36:42.520 --> 36:45.160
I'd swim in there
like an eagle on a fucking raft.

36:51.080 --> 36:55.320
Scott's just told us that
he fancies Marnie. Is he kidding?

37:04.880 --> 37:06.720
Scott wants what he can't have,

37:06.800 --> 37:10.000
and I just hope he doesn't
fuck Marnie's relationship up.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.400
Nathan's saying
I need to think about Chloe,

37:17.480 --> 37:20.040
but I can't stop everything
cos a girl likes us.

37:20.120 --> 37:23.160
There's a queue as long
as the Nile to dive on my chopper.

37:30.680 --> 37:34.000
For the first time in a long time,
I'm having a good night

37:34.080 --> 37:36.080
and having a mint time with the lads.

37:36.160 --> 37:39.480
And there's actually
a few nice girls knocking about.

37:47.680 --> 37:48.840
Yeah, yeah.

37:53.560 --> 37:56.720
I'm actually starting
to feel like a single lad again.

37:57.960 --> 38:00.400
Wait a second.
What the fuck is Kyle doing?

38:02.960 --> 38:05.760
Kyle is talking with a girl
and getting very flirty.

38:05.840 --> 38:08.800
Have you not realised that
Marnie is in the fucking club?

38:15.040 --> 38:17.400
What the fuck?
Kyle's just kissed a girl.

38:22.640 --> 38:25.880
Everyone looks mortal,
so it's time to get out of here.

38:25.960 --> 38:27.800
What the hell's wrong with Marnie?

38:29.760 --> 38:32.080
I'm fucking fuming.
That lad is a snake.

38:32.160 --> 38:35.120
You're a fucking liar!
I've just watched you do it!

38:35.200 --> 38:36.880
Marnie is losing her shit

38:36.960 --> 38:40.160
because I pecked this girl
on the lips. It wasn't that bad.

38:40.240 --> 38:43.600
You're still lying.
Go on. You wanna challenge me?

38:43.680 --> 38:48.280
You wanna challenge me?
You manipulative little...

38:55.560 --> 38:59.120
Holly needs to know exactly
what type of person Kyle really is.

38:59.200 --> 39:02.520
I didn't wanna tell her,
but it's about time she found out.

39:02.600 --> 39:06.040
I'm gonna tell me best friend
what you've just fucking done.

39:06.120 --> 39:08.160
Kyle.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:08.240 --> 39:09.800
Yeah, yeah.

39:09.880 --> 39:11.080
Oh, shit.

39:11.160 --> 39:12.960
Marnie's gone to wake up Holly.

39:13.040 --> 39:14.840
What the fuck is happening?

39:29.120 --> 39:30.200
In front of us.

39:30.280 --> 39:31.400
(both) Who?
Kyle!

39:31.480 --> 39:33.440
Kyle has kissed a girl?

39:33.520 --> 39:35.000
He's a fucking arsehole.

39:35.080 --> 39:37.240
What a fucking wanker!

39:41.720 --> 39:47.080
You fucking dick!
You fucking dick!

39:47.160 --> 39:48.720
Holly comes out screaming

39:48.800 --> 39:51.080
and blowing everything
out of proportion.

39:51.160 --> 39:52.920
Marnie has shit stirred this.

39:55.840 --> 39:59.240
(cries) You fucking hurt me.
No, man.

39:59.320 --> 40:02.080
I have been gone for five minutes
out of that club,

40:02.160 --> 40:03.840
and Kyle is kissing a girl.

40:03.920 --> 40:07.520
What the fuck was our relationship?
It was totally pointless.

40:08.800 --> 40:11.520
You're a fucking liar!
Stop lying now.

40:11.600 --> 40:13.440
I seen you with my own eyes.

40:13.520 --> 40:16.120
Why deny something
when I've blatantly seen it?

40:16.200 --> 40:17.600
He's a fucking scumbag.

40:17.680 --> 40:20.440
Don't lie. For once
in your fucking life. Admit it.

40:20.520 --> 40:23.960
You just believe Marnie?
What? Are you having a laugh?

40:24.040 --> 40:27.360
I've seen you kiss that lass.
(shouts)

40:27.440 --> 40:29.000
(both shout)

40:33.040 --> 40:34.800
I've literally lost control.

40:34.880 --> 40:38.000
I've started throwing stuff
and trying to attack him.

40:38.080 --> 40:40.960
Someone needs to get him
out of me sight.

40:42.480 --> 40:45.240
Poor Holly
has had a horrible day and night.

40:45.320 --> 40:48.360
It feels like there's
definitely no way back from here.

40:53.240 --> 40:55.240
How could you do that to us?

40:55.320 --> 40:56.960
You did.

40:59.840 --> 41:01.200
I loved you.

41:01.280 --> 41:03.960
I did see some kind of future with us
at one point,

41:04.040 --> 41:08.560
but right now, there will never, ever
be a me and you ever again.

41:08.640 --> 41:12.520
I've had the worst day of
my entire life, and I feel so alone.

41:13.760 --> 41:16.720
Tonight I felt free and single.

41:16.800 --> 41:19.680
But the reality is,
living with Holly,

41:19.760 --> 41:21.800
it's just not gonna be like that.

41:22.000 --> 41:22.200
.
