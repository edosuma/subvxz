00:00.397 --> 00:02.047
Previously on
<i>Warehouse 13...</i>

00:02.072 --> 00:04.435
H.G.'s not really here.
She's a hologram.

00:04.656 --> 00:06.814
That thing is projecting her.

00:07.101 --> 00:09.895
I drew my gun on Mrs. Fredrick,
and she fired me.

00:13.045 --> 00:15.069
How can my mom be a Regent
and not have told me?

00:15.137 --> 00:16.841
Collodi's Bracelet.

00:16.908 --> 00:19.071
I think it fell
into the hands of a young boy.

00:19.139 --> 00:21.041
The bracelet gave him control
of his own body,

00:21.109 --> 00:23.940
enabling him to walk.

00:24.008 --> 00:25.110
But it would have planted

00:25.178 --> 00:27.789
a seed of darkness
in his soul.

00:35.277 --> 00:37.684
Claudia, now would be a good
time to pinpoint that signal.

00:37.752 --> 00:38.919
I'm trying,
but whatever's transmitting

00:38.986 --> 00:40.186
from inside the warehouse

00:40.254 --> 00:42.221
has slowed the whole system
to a crawl.

00:42.289 --> 00:43.122
Pete, Myka.

00:43.190 --> 00:44.392
Any sign of the intruder, yet?

00:44.459 --> 00:46.263
Letter 36-J?

00:46.330 --> 00:47.330
It's quiet.

00:47.398 --> 00:50.136
Ditto,
in Montgomery.

00:50.204 --> 00:51.670
84-K.

00:55.408 --> 00:57.943
Clean in the Farnsworth aisle.

00:58.011 --> 00:59.778
The archive is safe.

00:59.846 --> 01:01.013
Well, keep looking.

01:01.081 --> 01:03.815
Someone or something
is still transmitting.

01:05.217 --> 01:07.018
Pete, you enter dark vault.

01:07.086 --> 01:08.286
And Myka, you go to aisle--

01:08.354 --> 01:09.989
Gotcha.

01:10.056 --> 01:12.258
Sulaco, 84-C.
It's there.

01:12.326 --> 01:14.295
Sulaco, 84-C.

01:14.362 --> 01:16.597
That's right
near the art gallery.

01:16.664 --> 01:19.370
Let's go, Claudia.

01:19.437 --> 01:21.940
Bring the scanner.

01:29.219 --> 01:32.256
That's why the computers
have been so glitchy lately.

01:32.324 --> 01:33.325
We've got bugs.

01:33.392 --> 01:34.826
To be specific, nanites.

01:34.894 --> 01:36.696
Aw, man.

01:36.763 --> 01:37.831
What are nanites?

01:37.899 --> 01:39.167
I don't know.

01:39.235 --> 01:40.702
Tiny, self-replicating
microscopic robots.

01:40.769 --> 01:42.871
Mechanical fleas slash spies.

01:42.939 --> 01:44.306
Could have hitched
a ride on anything.

01:44.374 --> 01:46.542
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Not these.

01:46.610 --> 01:48.578
These were planted
on that Van Gogh

01:48.646 --> 01:51.183
that Sally Stukowski
helped us retrieve.

01:51.251 --> 01:53.285
That painting is now
exactly one gram lighter.

01:53.353 --> 01:56.023
That grab was a setup.

01:56.090 --> 01:57.424
If she's working
for that psychopath

01:57.492 --> 01:58.492
that tried to kill my mom--

01:58.560 --> 01:59.961
Walter Sykes?

02:00.029 --> 02:00.896
They're downloading
a massive amount of data

02:00.963 --> 02:01.897
and transmitting it.

02:01.965 --> 02:02.898
To where?

02:02.965 --> 02:03.932
I can't tell yet.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.634
I want those things

02:05.702 --> 02:06.835
out of my warehouse, now.

02:06.903 --> 02:07.970
It could take me days
to interface

02:08.037 --> 02:09.305
with their coding, Artie.

02:09.372 --> 02:12.407
Then plan B.
When you got bugs,

02:12.475 --> 02:13.408
you zap 'em.

02:13.476 --> 02:16.678
Okay, everybody, back up.

02:16.746 --> 02:20.615
Say hello to my little friend.

02:23.652 --> 02:25.186
Oh, crap.

02:25.254 --> 02:28.657
Oh, no, no, no, no!

02:28.725 --> 02:30.025
Oh,
what are you doing?

02:30.093 --> 02:32.896
Something wrong here, Tyler?

02:32.964 --> 02:36.867
Uh, no,
Mr. Sykes, I--

02:36.935 --> 02:38.837
I think the warehouse found

02:38.905 --> 02:41.974
and shut down all the nanites.

02:42.042 --> 02:43.743
Before you got
what I needed?

02:43.811 --> 02:44.778
No, uh,
I got it.

02:44.846 --> 02:46.247
Um, you'll be happy.

02:46.314 --> 02:47.915
Have you decrypted
the data yet?

02:47.983 --> 02:52.620
I'm-I'm working on it, sir.

02:52.688 --> 02:54.089
Finish it.

02:54.157 --> 02:56.491
Then I'll be happy.

02:56.559 --> 02:58.861
Yes, sir.

03:03.934 --> 03:06.436
These nanites could be
a fatal breach.

03:06.504 --> 03:08.071
Do we have any idea
what Sykes was after?

03:08.139 --> 03:09.373
I'm typing as fast as I can.

03:09.441 --> 03:11.609
Okay, first, he rifled
through some inventory.

03:11.677 --> 03:13.778
Looking for the
Collodi Bracelet, I'll bet.

03:13.846 --> 03:15.113
Then he downloaded a file.

03:15.181 --> 03:16.615
"Atlas-66."

03:16.683 --> 03:19.485
But it's majorly encrypted.

03:19.553 --> 03:21.287
That file is
for Regent use only.

03:21.355 --> 03:22.922
Well, here's hoping.

03:22.990 --> 03:24.090
What do you think?

03:24.158 --> 03:25.392
Sykes could have
opened that file?

03:25.459 --> 03:27.961
Uh, I'm not even sure

03:28.028 --> 03:29.262
I could crack it.

03:29.330 --> 03:31.397
Well, you don't have to.
Jane has access.

03:31.465 --> 03:32.766
She can tell us
what's in the file,

03:32.833 --> 03:35.135
and we can finally
get ahead of Sykes.

03:35.202 --> 03:36.536
That's not how we'll proceed.

03:36.604 --> 03:38.605
But this could be our chance
to shut Sykes down.

03:38.672 --> 03:41.341
The Regents have a plan
in place, Agent Bering.

03:41.409 --> 03:44.811
So you're not gonna tell us
what's in Atlas-66?

03:44.879 --> 03:46.746
Perhaps
I haven't been clear.

03:46.814 --> 03:48.515
We have a plan in place.

03:48.583 --> 03:50.284
Well, perhaps
I haven't been clear.

03:50.351 --> 03:54.255
We need to know
what's in that file.

03:54.323 --> 03:55.823
Right, Pete?

03:55.891 --> 03:59.394
- Hmm?
Uh, well--

03:59.462 --> 04:01.563
Myka, if she says
there's a plan in place,

04:01.631 --> 04:04.266
we need to respect that, right?

04:04.334 --> 04:07.703
I mean, she is wearing
the Remati Shackle.

04:07.771 --> 04:13.143
So, Warehouse protection
is her call.

04:13.210 --> 04:14.978
Thank you, Pete.

04:15.046 --> 04:19.583
Now, excuse me.
I need to speak to Mr. Kosan.

04:19.649 --> 04:21.451
Excuse me,
I need to tag some stuff

04:21.519 --> 04:22.886
in the motorbike aisle.

04:22.954 --> 04:26.422
And with that, we all just
left it alone, right?

04:26.490 --> 04:27.523
Of course.

04:27.591 --> 04:28.958
Right.

04:35.799 --> 04:37.967
Lattimer!

04:38.035 --> 04:39.169
What the hell
is going on?

04:39.236 --> 04:40.470
Trust me, Myka.

04:40.538 --> 04:42.472
Arguing with my mother
will get you nowhere.

04:42.540 --> 04:44.141
So you're just
gonna lie down?

04:44.208 --> 04:45.275
Who are you?

04:45.343 --> 04:46.243
A guy who knew
you'd follow me.

04:50.482 --> 04:55.587
Old chum,
welcome to the Pete Cave.

04:55.654 --> 04:58.490
Sit down. I got
something to show you.

04:58.558 --> 05:00.459
You're not gonna make me
watch <i>Porky's</i> again, are you?

05:00.527 --> 05:03.329
No.

05:07.969 --> 05:10.971
So, you're not
just sitting back.

05:11.039 --> 05:12.540
Please.

05:12.607 --> 05:15.076
Okay. Now,
these are the facts.

05:15.144 --> 05:17.545
Walter Sykes,
paralyzed as a child,

05:17.612 --> 05:19.079
gets his hands
on the Collodi Bracelet,

05:19.147 --> 05:20.647
which allows him to walk again,

05:20.715 --> 05:23.650
but apparently, it turns him
into like, the worst guy ever.

05:23.718 --> 05:25.018
Right.

05:25.086 --> 05:27.787
The Warehouse snags it.
Sykes wants it back.

05:27.855 --> 05:30.423
He makes millions
in hedge funds.

05:30.491 --> 05:32.692
Then, ten years ago,
he cashes out

05:32.759 --> 05:34.894
and apparently vanishes
off the face of the Earth.

05:34.961 --> 05:36.161
So he's been planning a run
at the Warehouse

05:36.229 --> 05:37.762
for a long time?

05:37.830 --> 05:39.464
Right, but the minions he's
hired to do his dirty work

05:39.532 --> 05:41.633
all have one thing in common.

05:41.700 --> 05:42.967
They're dead.

05:43.035 --> 05:44.602
Well, the obit says
that Stukowski died

05:44.670 --> 05:46.303
of an undetected heart defect.

05:46.371 --> 05:49.306
Yeah, right.

05:49.374 --> 05:53.611
So, who's working
for Walter Sykes, now?

05:53.678 --> 05:54.745
Everything okay?

05:54.813 --> 05:57.381
- Yeah.
- Stay close.

05:57.449 --> 06:00.851
I'm going to need you two
to collect something important.

06:00.919 --> 06:03.087
We're ready.

06:03.155 --> 06:07.155
<font color=#00FF00>♪ Warehouse 13 3x11 ♪</font>

Original Air Date on October 3, 2011

== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

06:18.304 --> 06:21.640
You wanted to talk to me,
Mr. Sykes?

06:21.708 --> 06:25.077
Steve, you're still trying
to decide if you can trust me?

06:25.144 --> 06:28.013
Well, the enemy of my enemy
is my friend, right?

06:28.080 --> 06:31.683
Look, I just want my life back.

06:31.750 --> 06:33.617
My old job, my reputation.

06:33.685 --> 06:35.186
The Warehouse burned you.

06:35.253 --> 06:37.388
It burned me, too.

06:37.456 --> 06:40.157
You know, the Regents have
a nasty habit of reaching out

06:40.225 --> 06:42.393
and destroying people's lives.

06:42.461 --> 06:44.895
Believe me.
I've noticed.

06:44.963 --> 06:50.000
So, if I help you get
the Collodi Bracelet back,

06:50.068 --> 06:51.568
you can get me reinstated
at the ATF?

06:51.636 --> 06:53.070
Yeah.

06:53.137 --> 06:54.805
Or you can have a blank check
and start a new life.

06:54.872 --> 06:56.039
That's your call.

06:56.107 --> 06:58.809
Tyler cracked the first part
of the file.

06:58.876 --> 07:01.545
We know where it is.

07:01.612 --> 07:03.247
The only lead we have left
is this man

07:03.314 --> 07:04.782
who I clocked in Atlanta.

07:04.849 --> 07:06.717
It's just the face in a car.
It's not much to go on.

07:06.785 --> 07:08.519
Okay.
So, we profile, right?

07:08.587 --> 07:10.888
I mean, what kind of person
goes to work

07:10.956 --> 07:12.556
for a man
like Walter Sykes?

07:12.624 --> 07:15.359
A guy like Tyler Struhl.

07:15.427 --> 07:17.428
Hey,
did you follow us here?

07:17.496 --> 07:19.230
No, I've known about
the Pete Cave forever.

07:19.298 --> 07:21.332
Who do you think keeps it
stocked with cream soda?

07:21.399 --> 07:23.033
Really?
That was you?

07:23.101 --> 07:24.335
Wait,
who's Tyler Struhl?

07:24.403 --> 07:26.004
The hacker slash perv who was
killing women

07:26.071 --> 07:27.338
with the Golem Necklace.

07:27.406 --> 07:28.773
Hacker codes are
like a signature,

07:28.841 --> 07:30.441
and Tyler's
all over the nanites.

07:30.509 --> 07:32.210
Could he hack
into the Regent file?

07:32.277 --> 07:33.678
If I can, he can.

07:33.746 --> 07:35.113
I mean, I haven't been able to
open the whole thing,

07:35.181 --> 07:36.481
but I did dig out an address.

07:36.549 --> 07:38.417
Lincoln High School,
Cheyenne, Wyoming.

07:38.484 --> 07:39.551
Well, Cheyenne is only like,
two hours from here.

07:39.619 --> 07:41.052
We should check it out.

07:41.120 --> 07:42.687
Against Jane's orders?

07:42.755 --> 07:44.789
What's she gonna do?
Ground me?

07:44.857 --> 07:46.658
Anyway, I'm not going to sit
around here and wait

07:46.726 --> 07:47.592
for the next bad thing
to happen.

07:47.660 --> 07:48.593
I agree with Pete.

07:48.661 --> 07:49.928
I'll run interference.

07:49.995 --> 07:53.298
Go. Go now while she's
still with Kosan.

07:53.365 --> 07:54.866
This is a dangerous game.

07:54.934 --> 07:56.535
We must bring the rest of
Regents in on your plan.

07:56.602 --> 07:57.769
No.

07:57.837 --> 07:59.538
Sykes has already
tortured and killed

07:59.605 --> 08:00.939
Regents to get information.

08:01.007 --> 08:02.674
The less they all know,
the better.

08:02.742 --> 08:05.577
This is a great burden
for you to bear alone.

08:05.645 --> 08:07.947
Perhaps we should simply
eliminate Walter Sykes now and--

08:08.015 --> 08:10.449
Evan...

08:10.517 --> 08:12.852
We all agreed that we needed to
know his endgame.

08:12.920 --> 08:14.988
Without that knowledge,
even with Sykes gone,

08:15.055 --> 08:20.394
the Warehouse is still
vulnerable.

08:20.462 --> 08:23.097
There's more that's
troubling you.

08:23.165 --> 08:26.034
My son is on the frontline
of this war.

08:26.102 --> 08:28.436
If I'm wrong...

08:28.504 --> 08:31.806
I could lose a lot more than
the Warehouse.

08:35.144 --> 08:37.812
I'm going to take upstairs.
You take down.

08:43.751 --> 08:46.053
Hey, Myks.
You got anything?

08:46.121 --> 08:47.721
I think I found what Sykes
was looking for.

08:47.789 --> 08:48.756
You found the artifact?

08:48.823 --> 08:50.624
Not quite.

08:57.731 --> 08:59.732
H.G. Wells is--is here?

08:59.800 --> 09:02.034
What-she--she broke out
of Regent jail

09:02.102 --> 09:03.969
to come here?

09:04.036 --> 09:05.036
I wanna go talk to her.

09:05.104 --> 09:06.938
Ah, Myka, no.

09:07.006 --> 09:08.406
You-you know how
lethal she is.

09:08.474 --> 09:09.440
We don't know
what she's up to.

09:09.508 --> 09:10.975
Just wait there for me.

09:14.613 --> 09:16.413
Helena.

09:16.481 --> 09:18.549
Hello.

09:18.617 --> 09:20.551
Are you looking for somebody?

09:20.619 --> 09:22.453
Do the Regents know
you're here?

09:22.521 --> 09:24.122
Um--

09:24.189 --> 09:25.356
I'm sorry,
you must be lost.

09:25.424 --> 09:26.624
The main office is
straight down the hall.

09:26.692 --> 09:28.559
Look, we don't
have time for games.

09:28.627 --> 09:32.030
Some very dangerous people know
that you're here.

09:32.097 --> 09:34.465
Um, okay, uh--

09:34.533 --> 09:36.701
there must be some mistake here.

09:36.769 --> 09:38.836
Uh, let's just school security
and then--

09:38.904 --> 09:43.107
- Freeze!
- Ah!

09:43.175 --> 09:45.309
Now that's new.

09:45.377 --> 09:47.578
Why'd you come in here,
all guns a-blazing?

09:47.646 --> 09:49.513
It's an escaped H.G. Wells,
Myks.

09:49.581 --> 09:50.548
What if she was
having one of her

09:50.615 --> 09:51.649
let's-end-the-world days?

09:51.716 --> 09:53.083
No, something's wrong,
okay?

09:53.151 --> 09:55.018
She's acting like she doesn't
even know who I am.

09:55.086 --> 09:57.921
Well, at least we know
what Sykes is after.

09:57.989 --> 10:00.090
But what he wants
with lady cuckoo?

10:03.761 --> 10:05.595
Hello.

10:05.663 --> 10:06.663
Hi.

10:06.731 --> 10:08.632
Who are you people?

10:08.700 --> 10:10.034
What do you want from me?

10:10.101 --> 10:11.936
We're United States
Secret Service.

10:12.004 --> 10:15.073
We may be dealing with a case
of identity theft.

10:15.140 --> 10:17.142
We just need to see
your driver's license.

10:19.613 --> 10:20.980
It's in my purse.

10:21.047 --> 10:22.815
Careful, Myka.

10:22.883 --> 10:24.751
Well, it could be booby trapped.

10:26.000 --> 10:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:45.439 --> 10:50.076
Pete, look at this.

10:50.144 --> 10:53.246
Who the heck is Emily Lake?

10:58.485 --> 11:01.320
I don't suppose we could put
a doggy door in the umbilicus?

11:02.689 --> 11:04.589
Doggy door.

11:04.657 --> 11:07.558
You're silly.

11:07.626 --> 11:08.526
Whatcha doing?

11:08.594 --> 11:11.062
Ah, you know.

11:11.130 --> 11:12.964
Updating the firewalls,
reviewing inventory,

11:13.032 --> 11:17.769
blah bitty blah.
The ushe.

11:20.840 --> 11:22.474
Fine.

11:22.542 --> 11:24.276
Okay.

11:24.344 --> 11:27.346
You got me.

11:27.414 --> 11:29.315
I'm playing fruit combat.

11:29.383 --> 11:33.787
Until Jane tells us the plan,
I am bored, so--

11:33.854 --> 11:35.255
All right.
I'm going to my room.

11:35.323 --> 11:37.157
Trailer.

11:43.566 --> 11:45.867
Busted.

11:45.935 --> 11:47.936
Did you just
Mrs. Frederic'd me?

11:48.004 --> 11:49.171
Tell me that that is not

11:49.239 --> 11:51.273
the Regents' encrypted
Atlas file,

11:51.341 --> 11:53.375
and that you are not
doing the one thing

11:53.443 --> 11:55.477
that you were explicitly
told not to do.

11:55.545 --> 11:56.712
That would be lying
and if there's one thing

11:56.780 --> 11:57.846
I'll never do--

11:57.914 --> 12:00.649
Where are Pete and Myka?

12:02.318 --> 12:03.952
I still don't know
why the Secret Service

12:04.020 --> 12:05.387
has to see my apartment,

12:05.455 --> 12:08.623
but here it is.

12:08.691 --> 12:12.327
I-I'm not this Helena,
whoever that is.

12:12.394 --> 12:15.596
Look, it's not--it's not
that we don't believe you.

12:15.664 --> 12:18.699
It's just we want to understand
what's going on.

12:20.368 --> 12:21.201
There's something
in the kitchen.

12:21.269 --> 12:22.535
Oh, Dickens.

12:22.603 --> 12:24.003
Mommy's home.

12:24.071 --> 12:26.438
H.G. Wells is a...

12:26.506 --> 12:28.174
Cat lady?

12:28.241 --> 12:31.611
Yeah, good boy.

12:31.678 --> 12:34.546
Hello.

12:34.614 --> 12:36.148
Dickens is hungry.

12:36.216 --> 12:38.183
And scared.

12:38.251 --> 12:40.018
- Just like his mommy.
- Oh.

12:40.086 --> 12:43.087
I'm gonna feed him.

12:43.155 --> 12:47.192
Shoot me if you have to.

12:47.260 --> 12:48.827
Myka, we don't have time
for this, okay?

12:48.894 --> 12:53.165
Sykes could be
on his way here right now.

12:53.232 --> 12:55.066
Bills, magazines--

12:55.134 --> 12:57.936
they're all addressed
to Emily Lake.

12:58.004 --> 12:59.504
Okay, so she fooled
the post office.

12:59.572 --> 13:00.505
It's not that hard to do.

13:00.573 --> 13:02.073
Myka, don't buy this.

13:02.141 --> 13:03.642
She is a lunatic killer,

13:03.710 --> 13:06.678
and she's just--
she's hiding it somehow.

13:06.746 --> 13:08.880
Pete...

13:08.948 --> 13:13.184
Oh, my God.
Look at this.

13:13.252 --> 13:15.954
There's no reflection
in the mirror.

13:16.022 --> 13:17.455
She wasn't really there.

13:17.523 --> 13:20.325
These--these are all fakes.

13:20.393 --> 13:21.659
Somebody must have created

13:21.727 --> 13:24.796
a-a new identity for her.

13:24.863 --> 13:26.998
Who does that sound
like to you?

13:27.066 --> 13:28.366
The Regents?

13:28.434 --> 13:30.402
Some sort
of Witness Protection program?

13:30.469 --> 13:33.739
We got this info
from the Atlas file.

13:33.806 --> 13:36.008
Atlas-66.

13:36.076 --> 13:37.276
That's--that's it.

13:37.344 --> 13:40.613
H.G. Wells was born
in Atlas House in 1866.

13:40.681 --> 13:42.382
I can't believe
that I missed that.

13:42.449 --> 13:43.984
Yeah, sloppy.

13:44.051 --> 13:45.118
We gotta get her
somewhere safe

13:45.186 --> 13:47.688
before Sykes finds her.

13:47.755 --> 13:50.891
Let me go.

13:50.959 --> 13:53.126
I've-I've got a knife.

13:53.194 --> 13:54.360
All right.
Let's not do that, okay?

13:56.630 --> 13:59.498
Do you see?
H.G. knows Kempo.

13:59.566 --> 14:01.000
If she wanted to hurt you,

14:01.068 --> 14:03.369
you'd be lying in a pool
of your own blood right now.

14:03.436 --> 14:05.237
I-I-I don't want
to hurt anyone.

14:05.304 --> 14:06.304
I just--

14:06.372 --> 14:08.373
Wait.

14:11.510 --> 14:12.511
What is it?

14:12.578 --> 14:13.812
I got a vibe.

14:13.880 --> 14:15.714
A bad one.

14:46.880 --> 14:49.849
Aw.
You just missed her.

14:49.917 --> 14:50.950
Where is she?

14:51.018 --> 14:53.286
What does Sykes want
with H.G.?

14:53.354 --> 14:55.689
Time machine,
Minoan Trident?

14:55.757 --> 14:58.726
Or just another homicidal maniac
to add to his roster?

14:58.794 --> 15:01.263
He was right.
You are a talker.

15:01.330 --> 15:02.931
Who was right?

15:52.643 --> 15:54.277
Hey.

15:54.345 --> 15:55.511
You guys okay?

15:55.579 --> 15:56.946
Pete.

15:57.013 --> 15:58.380
Steve, what--

15:58.448 --> 16:01.450
He took my Tesla.

16:01.518 --> 16:02.918
You're working for Sykes?

16:02.986 --> 16:03.986
Where's Marcus?

16:04.053 --> 16:05.720
Marcus?

16:05.788 --> 16:08.023
Oh, oh. Is that--is that
your new partner?

16:08.091 --> 16:10.559
The guy who just tried
to kill me?

16:12.562 --> 16:14.130
I've got some
bad news for you, pal.

16:19.069 --> 16:20.670
What the hell?

16:20.738 --> 16:21.671
Is that H.G.?

16:21.739 --> 16:23.574
Yes.

16:23.641 --> 16:25.976
Then we're done.

16:32.984 --> 16:34.819
No!

16:55.311 --> 16:57.078
Farnsworth.

16:57.146 --> 16:59.080
You are both in big trouble.

16:59.148 --> 17:01.449
You don't know
the half of it.

17:01.516 --> 17:02.550
We lost her, Artie.

17:02.618 --> 17:04.285
W-wait.
Lost who?

17:04.353 --> 17:05.618
Emily Lake.

17:05.686 --> 17:08.588
You two found Emily Lake?

17:08.656 --> 17:09.623
Where is she?

17:09.691 --> 17:11.058
Sykes has her.

17:11.126 --> 17:13.895
Damn it! This is why
you follow orders!

17:13.962 --> 17:15.896
Look, Sykes would have
gotten her either way,

17:15.964 --> 17:17.031
and we wouldn't have
known about it.

17:17.098 --> 17:19.133
We know who's working
for him, Artie.

17:19.201 --> 17:21.368
A guy by the name of Marcus
who just

17:21.435 --> 17:24.439
walked away
from a five-story fall.

17:24.506 --> 17:25.606
What?

17:25.674 --> 17:27.342
And someone else.

17:27.409 --> 17:29.477
Someone we know.

17:29.545 --> 17:30.979
No.

17:31.047 --> 17:32.114
No way, that's--

17:32.182 --> 17:33.983
Artie,
that's not even possible.

17:34.051 --> 17:35.451
Steve would never turn on us.

17:35.519 --> 17:37.053
We're his friends.

17:37.121 --> 17:38.354
He's-he's--must be being
controlled or blackmailed,

17:38.422 --> 17:39.355
or maybe there's an arti--

17:39.423 --> 17:40.357
Claudia, Claudia.

17:40.424 --> 17:41.491
He Tesla'd Pete and Myka.

17:41.559 --> 17:43.160
He kidnapped H.G.

17:43.228 --> 17:45.796
No one was forcing him
to do those things.

17:45.864 --> 17:47.464
Then this is
the Regents' fault.

17:47.532 --> 17:48.966
They burned him.
They gave him no choice.

17:49.034 --> 17:52.102
Everyone has a choice.

17:52.170 --> 17:53.103
And as I've discovered,

17:53.170 --> 17:55.538
people often make the wrong one.

18:04.346 --> 18:06.281
Please.

18:06.349 --> 18:09.084
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

18:09.152 --> 18:11.754
I've never even heard
of any...

18:11.822 --> 18:13.689
Warehouse 13.

18:13.757 --> 18:16.593
You are H.G. Wells.

18:16.660 --> 18:18.194
That's insane.

18:18.262 --> 18:20.964
My name is Emily Lake.

18:21.032 --> 18:24.034
Emily Hannah Lake!
I grew up in Omaha--

18:29.074 --> 18:30.941
You're lying.

18:34.812 --> 18:37.080
She's telling the truth.

18:37.148 --> 18:38.648
You're absolutely certain?

18:38.716 --> 18:40.650
You know I can tell,
and she's not lying.

18:40.718 --> 18:42.952
Or at least she believes what
she's saying is true.

18:43.020 --> 18:44.720
Well, I got a gift too,
Steve.

18:44.788 --> 18:49.559
Getting people
to tell me things.

18:49.627 --> 18:51.828
Cecil B. Demille's riding crop.

18:51.895 --> 18:53.530
It won't work.

18:53.597 --> 18:56.233
It lets you bend people's
actions to your will.

18:56.301 --> 18:57.634
But you can't control
their minds.

18:57.702 --> 19:00.538
You've collected quite
a few artifacts.

19:00.606 --> 19:02.607
Yeah,
enough to even up the odds.

19:02.675 --> 19:05.544
I'm inclined to trust
your gift, Steve.

19:05.611 --> 19:07.679
I mean, after all,
that is why we sought you out.

19:07.747 --> 19:09.314
So we'll leave Ms. Lake alone,

19:09.381 --> 19:13.150
and give Tyler enough time to
crack the rest of that file.

19:13.218 --> 19:15.252
Hopefully, the answers
are inside.

19:18.990 --> 19:20.223
For her sake.

19:23.594 --> 19:26.061
What exactly did
you do to H.G.?

19:26.129 --> 19:28.697
Myka,
it was the most humane option.

19:28.765 --> 19:31.700
After the near-catastrophe
at Yosemite,

19:31.768 --> 19:33.335
well, the Regents
had to do something.

19:33.403 --> 19:37.473
The punishment was unusual,
but it wasn't cruel.

19:37.541 --> 19:39.408
We searched for something
that would give H.G.

19:39.476 --> 19:41.844
a chance at a normal life
while still allowing us

19:41.912 --> 19:43.746
to use her as a resource.

19:43.814 --> 19:45.048
Claudia,

19:45.115 --> 19:47.117
I assume you cracked
the rest of Atlas-66.

19:47.184 --> 19:48.051
Yup.

19:50.321 --> 19:52.455
A Janus coin.

19:52.523 --> 19:53.423
Two heads.

19:53.491 --> 19:54.791
It facilitates the separation

19:54.859 --> 19:57.594
of a person's consciousness
from their body.

19:57.662 --> 19:59.162
Like the Zoetrope did to Hugo.

19:59.230 --> 20:01.197
The Zoetrope is a machete.

20:01.265 --> 20:04.034
The Janus coin
is a finely honed scalpel.

20:04.102 --> 20:06.370
Artie, show them the video.
It will make it clear.

20:10.842 --> 20:13.644
So...

20:13.711 --> 20:16.713
How exactly will this work?

20:16.781 --> 20:18.715
In Roman mythology,

20:18.783 --> 20:21.151
Janus is
the God of transitions.

20:21.219 --> 20:23.553
There's two heads,

20:23.621 --> 20:25.155
looking opposite directions.

20:25.223 --> 20:27.958
Forward

20:28.026 --> 20:29.426
and back.

20:29.494 --> 20:32.663
My past life
and my future life.

20:32.731 --> 20:34.431
Yes.

20:34.499 --> 20:37.001
And the coin will separate
the two.

20:40.939 --> 20:44.308
So, I'll lose all knowledge
of the Warehouse.

20:44.376 --> 20:45.476
Yes.

20:45.544 --> 20:47.645
And everyone I've ever known?

20:47.713 --> 20:48.579
Yes.

20:57.990 --> 21:01.093
One request.

21:01.160 --> 21:04.462
May I keep my love
of literature?

21:04.530 --> 21:06.398
That can be arranged.

21:19.912 --> 21:22.748
We'll start
with your earliest memories.

21:22.815 --> 21:23.648
Mother and father.

21:27.653 --> 21:30.589
That's right.
Move through your childhood.

21:30.657 --> 21:32.624
Your young adulthood.

21:32.691 --> 21:34.992
Your first day at Warehouse 12.

21:37.262 --> 21:39.729
Tell me what you're thinking.

21:39.797 --> 21:41.865
I met an old man.

21:41.932 --> 21:44.267
He was my teacher.

21:44.334 --> 21:47.303
His name was Caturanga.

21:47.370 --> 21:48.471
Tell me his name again.

21:48.538 --> 21:49.372
I--

21:53.545 --> 21:55.012
I don't remember.

21:55.079 --> 21:57.014
Good.

21:57.082 --> 22:01.352
Think about your inventions,
your experiments, your writings.

22:01.420 --> 22:06.257
Picture Kempo and weaponry.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.292
People...

22:08.360 --> 22:12.229
Friends, family, lovers.

22:14.532 --> 22:17.668
Let the images come to you.
Conjure them.

22:17.735 --> 22:20.637
Your whole life in England,
let it go.

22:20.705 --> 22:22.405
You're American now.

22:27.043 --> 22:27.977
Who are you?

22:28.044 --> 22:29.879
I'm Mr. Kosan.

22:33.384 --> 22:35.318
You had a terrible accident.

22:35.386 --> 22:36.586
And you lost your memory.

22:36.654 --> 22:40.991
But I'm going to help you
get it back.

22:41.059 --> 22:42.994
Thank you.

22:43.062 --> 22:45.096
They sent her to Wyoming,
gave her a place to live,

22:45.164 --> 22:46.364
a cat,

22:46.432 --> 22:48.399
photos of the past
that never existed,

22:48.467 --> 22:50.134
and we gave her a job.

22:50.202 --> 22:52.036
School teacher.

22:52.104 --> 22:53.137
Like you.

22:53.205 --> 22:54.339
As for the rest,
well,

22:54.406 --> 22:56.441
the human mind is
pretty inventive.

22:56.508 --> 22:58.543
Given enough time
and stimulation,

22:58.610 --> 23:00.911
it fills in the gaps
all by itself.

23:00.979 --> 23:02.913
So if H.G.'s memory's
been wiped,

23:02.981 --> 23:04.348
then who's the hologram
we've been talking to

23:04.416 --> 23:05.416
the last few months?

23:05.484 --> 23:08.452
Not wiped.
Stored.

23:08.520 --> 23:09.954
On the Janus coin.

23:10.022 --> 23:12.591
Which, according to the file,
is kept in a Regent vault

23:12.658 --> 23:14.025
in Elk Ridge, South Dakota.

23:14.093 --> 23:17.562
Sykes is going to send
Marcus and Steve for the coin.

23:17.630 --> 23:19.164
Look, I know that the Regents
have a plan,

23:19.231 --> 23:22.100
but we can't risk Sykes
getting a hold of that coin.

23:22.168 --> 23:24.202
If he already has Emily Lake,

23:24.270 --> 23:26.238
if he tries to put H.G.
back together...

23:26.305 --> 23:27.472
You're both right.

23:27.540 --> 23:29.007
You and Myka need
to retrieve that coin,

23:29.074 --> 23:30.542
and bring it back here.

23:41.687 --> 23:45.423
Mr. Sykes!
Mr. Sykes!

23:47.760 --> 23:48.660
I got it.

23:48.727 --> 23:50.061
I found what you're looking for.

23:50.129 --> 23:51.196
And the best part is

23:51.264 --> 23:52.531
it's not even in the Warehouse.

24:01.795 --> 24:03.529
So, how do we get
into this vault?

24:03.597 --> 24:05.665
Mom said all we'd need
is this fancy key

24:05.732 --> 24:08.367
and this list of stuff to buy.

24:12.240 --> 24:14.575
This is the Regent vault?

24:14.642 --> 24:15.809
Of course it is.

24:15.877 --> 24:17.511
Hidden in plain sight.

24:17.579 --> 24:18.612
That's what they do.

24:18.680 --> 24:19.647
You got our list?

24:19.714 --> 24:21.782
Alfred, let's go shopping.

24:30.491 --> 24:31.424
That's weird.

24:31.492 --> 24:33.126
Not when you get to know us.

24:33.194 --> 24:35.261
I gotta get my manager.

24:37.831 --> 24:38.931
Okay.

24:38.999 --> 24:43.202
Fruits, grain, meats,
alcohol, honey.

24:43.269 --> 24:45.537
These are all items
that the ancient Egyptians

24:45.605 --> 24:48.373
used to leave for their Kings
in the burial tombs--

24:48.441 --> 24:49.942
Which were also
known as vaults.

24:50.009 --> 24:51.377
Right.

24:51.444 --> 24:53.846
Man, the Regents really love
the Egyptian stuff, huh?

24:53.914 --> 24:55.815
It's like a fetish.

25:00.020 --> 25:03.656
Wow, definitely
in the right grocery store.

25:03.723 --> 25:04.723
Come with me.

25:25.011 --> 25:26.112
The key.

25:26.180 --> 25:27.013
Oh.

25:34.857 --> 25:36.391
He's not very chatty,
is he?

25:36.458 --> 25:37.325
No, he's not.

25:46.036 --> 25:48.371
I'll be in the stock room.

25:53.543 --> 25:56.612
Okay, so,
here's the sphere.

25:56.680 --> 25:57.747
Where's the Janus coin?

25:57.815 --> 26:01.717
I remember seeing a slot.
Ah-ha.

26:01.785 --> 26:03.753
See?
I always loved piggy banks.

26:03.821 --> 26:05.489
- What?
- Let me see.

26:05.557 --> 26:07.891
So, then if a coin

26:07.959 --> 26:10.929
is like the hard disk,

26:10.996 --> 26:16.702
then to reboot,
I just slide it back in.

26:23.244 --> 26:24.745
Oh, hello.

26:24.812 --> 26:27.314
What's this?
Uh, another mission?

26:27.381 --> 26:30.183
Lady, we've got
a lot to tell you.

26:34.989 --> 26:37.891
Living with a cat
in Wyoming?

26:37.958 --> 26:39.292
Also, you have
an American accent

26:39.360 --> 26:42.596
and a really girly scream.

26:42.664 --> 26:46.166
So, my body's out there
teaching high school English?

26:46.234 --> 26:48.969
And your students love you.

26:49.037 --> 26:50.404
But a cat?

26:50.472 --> 26:51.906
Dickens is solid.

26:51.974 --> 26:53.674
Saved my bacon.

26:53.742 --> 26:54.809
Yes,

26:54.877 --> 26:56.244
I don't know
what that means,

26:56.311 --> 26:58.579
but what does this
Mr. Sykes want from me?

26:58.647 --> 27:02.416
We were kinda hoping
you could tell us.

27:02.484 --> 27:05.319
Uh--I'm afraid I have
absolutely no idea.

27:07.021 --> 27:07.921
Get her here
as fast as you can,

27:07.989 --> 27:08.889
and keep your eyes open.

27:08.957 --> 27:10.023
And be careful.

27:10.091 --> 27:11.091
Stick to the back roads.

27:11.159 --> 27:12.226
The back roads?

27:12.293 --> 27:14.995
Driving from Elk Ridge
to Univille?

27:15.063 --> 27:16.863
Good point.

27:16.931 --> 27:17.764
Stay alert.

27:23.938 --> 27:25.339
I don't have a good feeling
about all this.

27:25.406 --> 27:27.374
I'm not used to
military maneuvers.

27:27.442 --> 27:28.943
I'm an
elementary school teacher.

27:29.010 --> 27:32.613
Elementary school teacher
to Regent.

27:32.681 --> 27:33.648
Strange trajectory.

27:33.716 --> 27:34.849
Not at all.

27:34.917 --> 27:36.685
Each Regent is selected

27:36.752 --> 27:39.588
for his or her
area of expertise.

27:39.655 --> 27:41.256
Each brings
a unique perspective.

27:41.324 --> 27:45.126
I was chosen for my insight
into children.

27:45.194 --> 27:46.561
Jane...

27:46.629 --> 27:50.698
What's the downside
to the Collodi Bracelet?

27:50.766 --> 27:53.701
If the user wears it
for too long,

27:53.769 --> 27:57.037
it plants a seed of darkness
in the soul

27:57.105 --> 28:00.741
and creates
an insatiable longing.

28:00.808 --> 28:05.212
And at the same time,
this longing hardens the heart.

28:05.280 --> 28:08.716
The wearer cannot give
or receive love.

28:08.784 --> 28:14.956
Is it possible,
all those years ago,

28:15.024 --> 28:16.757
we didn't get
to the boy in time?

28:22.031 --> 28:22.964
Hey, Myka.

28:23.032 --> 28:25.834
I, uh--I have a thought.

28:25.901 --> 28:27.802
About a way to protect
the Warehouse,

28:27.869 --> 28:28.803
but--

28:28.870 --> 28:29.704
But what?

28:31.506 --> 28:33.007
You might not like it.

28:33.075 --> 28:35.509
Well, if it protects the
Warehouse, I like it already.

28:35.577 --> 28:38.045
What is it?

28:38.113 --> 28:40.147
Whoa,
where are we going?

28:40.215 --> 28:41.048
Off road.

28:46.888 --> 28:50.958
We have to destroy
the Janus coin.

28:51.026 --> 28:52.526
What?

28:52.594 --> 28:54.361
I know you're gonna think
this is personal--

28:54.429 --> 28:55.863
How could I not?

28:55.931 --> 28:58.932
You're--you're talking about
killing a human being.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.067
No, I'm talking
about destroying

29:00.135 --> 29:01.802
the thing that Sykes is after.

29:01.870 --> 29:02.736
We can stop it,
right here.

29:02.804 --> 29:04.071
Right now.

29:04.139 --> 29:06.974
She has one of
the greatest minds in history!

29:07.042 --> 29:09.944
It's--it would be like
burning down a library

29:10.012 --> 29:13.281
w-with a friend
trapped inside.

29:13.348 --> 29:15.583
I know.

29:15.651 --> 29:16.851
But we're at war,

29:16.919 --> 29:19.120
and unfortunately,
wars have casualties.

29:19.188 --> 29:20.822
No.

29:20.889 --> 29:23.291
Okay, so you're willing
to live with the possibility

29:23.359 --> 29:25.126
that Sykes might get
what he wants.

29:25.194 --> 29:27.195
H.G. would never help him.

29:27.262 --> 29:29.830
Myka, the man has proven
he can get information

29:29.898 --> 29:31.099
from anyone.

29:31.167 --> 29:32.967
Even Steve's working
for him.

29:33.035 --> 29:34.302
No, he's not.
I know he's not.

29:34.370 --> 29:36.504
Okay, just hold up.
Both of you.

29:36.571 --> 29:38.940
We have to deal with reality.

29:39.007 --> 29:40.775
Wait, Claudia.
Claudia!

29:43.645 --> 29:46.780
Like, I'm just thinking
of the greater good.

29:46.848 --> 29:48.315
As long as that coin exists,

29:48.382 --> 29:51.083
it can be used
against the Warehouse.

29:51.151 --> 29:53.586
The answer is still no.

29:53.653 --> 29:59.825
We cannot--I will not
destroy H.G. Wells.

29:59.893 --> 30:03.428
May I offer an opinion?

30:03.496 --> 30:05.163
I figured she should be
part of this discussion.

30:05.230 --> 30:06.898
There is no discussion.

30:06.966 --> 30:09.901
Agreed.

30:09.969 --> 30:11.803
If you truly want
to protect the Warehouse,

30:11.871 --> 30:15.472
you must destroy the coin.

30:16.874 --> 30:18.074
Destroy the coin,

30:18.142 --> 30:19.609
and whatever Sykes wants from me

30:19.677 --> 30:22.378
will be lost with it.

30:22.446 --> 30:24.614
Wait.

30:24.682 --> 30:27.617
You'd be gone, you'd--

30:27.684 --> 30:32.188
you'd be dead.

30:32.256 --> 30:33.456
The price is too high.

30:38.062 --> 30:41.398
What about Emily Lake?

30:41.465 --> 30:45.101
If Sykes thinks he can
put her back together,

30:45.169 --> 30:47.337
she's in a lot of danger.

30:50.974 --> 30:56.278
Destroy me, and she'll be
of no value to him.

30:56.346 --> 30:59.248
Myka, you say she's a teacher

30:59.316 --> 31:04.087
and her students love her.

31:04.154 --> 31:07.156
Then, let me
live on through her.

31:07.224 --> 31:10.793
We could rescue Emily Lake.

31:10.861 --> 31:13.029
I can promise you that.

31:13.097 --> 31:14.864
I have every confidence
that you will.

31:20.805 --> 31:26.643
Myka, we have to think
rationally, not emotionally.

31:26.711 --> 31:28.778
And quickly.

31:28.846 --> 31:32.282
Before I remember
that I'm not this noble.

31:32.350 --> 31:35.151
It's the right thing to do,
Myka.

31:35.219 --> 31:38.855
You know that,
don't you?

31:38.922 --> 31:41.190
Pete, um--I think you'll have
to be the one to---

31:41.258 --> 31:42.625
I know.

31:42.693 --> 31:45.895
I will.

31:45.963 --> 31:48.065
And...

31:48.132 --> 31:49.399
Thanks for everything,
Helena.

31:57.009 --> 32:01.347
I regret I won't be here
to see you reach your destiny.

32:01.415 --> 32:05.317
It will surely be
a glorious one.

32:05.385 --> 32:08.287
I don't know
about that.

32:08.355 --> 32:09.788
Then, you're the only one.

32:15.561 --> 32:17.795
How do you say goodbye
to the one person

32:17.863 --> 32:20.064
who knows you better
than anyone else?

32:20.132 --> 32:22.166
I wish I knew.

32:22.234 --> 32:24.235
Be brave.

32:24.303 --> 32:26.137
I need your strength.

32:32.246 --> 32:34.514
The last thing I want
to see is the sky.

32:54.903 --> 32:59.140
Pete.

32:59.208 --> 33:02.778
I can't watch this.

33:02.846 --> 33:03.679
Me neither.

33:25.570 --> 33:27.404
Forgive me for this.

33:39.550 --> 33:41.684
Why can't I move?

33:41.752 --> 33:44.320
Because I'm controlling
your body now.

33:44.388 --> 33:47.590
I'll get the coin.

33:47.658 --> 33:49.158
Not one move!

33:52.396 --> 33:53.998
Myka,
he has an artifact.

33:54.065 --> 33:55.299
How'd you find us?

33:55.367 --> 33:57.034
Traced the signal
on Claudia's cell.

33:57.102 --> 33:58.669
You're a traitor.

33:58.737 --> 34:01.840
Traitor.

34:01.908 --> 34:03.475
Stop or Marcus is dead!

34:03.543 --> 34:06.111
Yeah, well, Marcus doesn't
usually stay dead for long.

34:10.049 --> 34:12.817
Then I'll shoot you,
Steve.

34:12.885 --> 34:16.087
I don't think
that you will.

34:16.155 --> 34:18.190
Just in case...

34:18.257 --> 34:20.192
No!

34:21.226 --> 34:23.795
Myka!

34:23.862 --> 34:24.696
Claudia!

34:42.882 --> 34:45.617
Give me the coin.

34:45.685 --> 34:46.985
You know what?
I got a better idea.

34:47.053 --> 34:49.021
How about you
fill in the blanks?

34:49.088 --> 34:50.889
Tell me how we went
from being partners and friends

34:50.956 --> 34:52.724
to you pointing a gun at me?

34:52.792 --> 34:54.359
How could you work for Sykes?

34:54.427 --> 34:55.694
There are things
that you don't know.

34:55.762 --> 34:57.029
About the Regents,
about Jane.

34:57.096 --> 35:02.167
Now, give me the coin.

35:02.235 --> 35:03.802
I know this.

35:03.870 --> 35:05.204
You want this coin?

35:09.909 --> 35:11.877
You're going to have
to shoot me.

35:13.747 --> 35:14.780
Claudia!

35:14.848 --> 35:17.149
Claudia!

35:17.217 --> 35:19.385
I don't care
what I have to do.

35:19.453 --> 35:20.386
You're dead, man.

35:20.454 --> 35:21.386
You're dead!

35:21.454 --> 35:23.489
You're very perceptive.

35:23.556 --> 35:25.190
Hey, where's Claudia?
Where is she?

35:25.258 --> 35:26.558
Do you have the coin?

35:26.626 --> 35:28.127
Let's go.

35:28.194 --> 35:29.928
Now, you can help
Claudia and Myka,

35:29.996 --> 35:30.963
or you can follow us.
That's your choice.

35:31.031 --> 35:32.932
- You selfish--
- Pete!

35:33.000 --> 35:34.333
If you're gonna help Claudia,

35:34.401 --> 35:38.037
you have to hurry up.

35:48.014 --> 35:50.382
- Claudia!
- Claude?

35:50.450 --> 35:51.383
Are you all right?

35:51.451 --> 35:52.351
Yeah, I'm fine.

35:52.419 --> 35:54.052
Claudia!

35:54.120 --> 35:57.489
Claudia!

35:57.557 --> 35:58.456
Claude!

35:58.524 --> 35:59.857
Please keep it down.

35:59.925 --> 36:01.993
- Why didn't you answer us?
- Is Steve gone?

36:02.061 --> 36:03.328
He told me to wait
until he was gone.

36:03.396 --> 36:04.697
Wait--wait for what?
Claudia, what's going on?

36:04.765 --> 36:05.698
And how did he get the coin?

36:05.766 --> 36:07.800
I gave it to him.

36:07.868 --> 36:09.402
What?

36:09.470 --> 36:11.437
He told me your mom's plan.

36:11.505 --> 36:15.242
You want this coin?

36:15.309 --> 36:18.913
You're gonna
have to shoot me.

36:20.115 --> 36:21.682
Listen, Claudia.
Listen to me.

36:21.750 --> 36:23.952
I am undercover.

36:24.019 --> 36:25.153
The whole thing has been
a setup.

36:25.220 --> 36:26.754
Mrs. F fired me in Atlanta,

36:26.822 --> 36:28.823
Jane and the Regents
burning me--

36:28.891 --> 36:30.892
my mission is
to gain Sykes' trust,

36:30.959 --> 36:32.560
so I can learn
what he's planning.

36:32.628 --> 36:35.196
Now can you calm down, now?

36:37.500 --> 36:38.633
Yeah?

36:42.571 --> 36:45.007
But you Tesla'd Pete and Myka.

36:45.074 --> 36:46.942
Better than letting
Marcus shoot them.

36:55.349 --> 36:56.716
I wish...

36:56.784 --> 36:58.685
That you could look in my eyes

36:58.753 --> 37:01.787
and see that I'm not lying.

37:01.854 --> 37:03.255
I'm still on your side, Claude.

37:03.323 --> 37:05.390
I always have been.

37:08.928 --> 37:11.096
I am so sorry that I didn't
tell you the truth,

37:11.164 --> 37:13.465
but it was the safest way.

37:13.533 --> 37:14.700
Whatever Sykes is planning

37:14.768 --> 37:16.469
is bad for everyone
in the Warehouse.

37:16.537 --> 37:19.138
I've never seen anyone
so filled with hate.

37:19.206 --> 37:21.407
Then, get out of there.

37:21.475 --> 37:22.941
Why are you taking
this huge risk,

37:23.009 --> 37:25.411
getting chummy
with those psychos?

37:25.478 --> 37:28.347
Because...

37:28.415 --> 37:33.386
I couldn't save my sister.

37:33.454 --> 37:35.755
But I can protect you.

37:51.139 --> 37:52.506
Show this to Pete and Myka.
It's where he is.

37:52.573 --> 37:53.773
And don't make a sound

37:53.841 --> 37:56.609
till you know I'm gone.

37:56.676 --> 37:57.943
Cover your ears.

37:58.011 --> 37:59.678
So brave.

38:15.429 --> 38:17.597
That's why Jane
couldn't tell us.

38:17.665 --> 38:22.436
Steve is the plan.

38:22.504 --> 38:25.338
It all rests on him.

38:25.406 --> 38:26.773
He volunteered.

38:26.841 --> 38:30.509
He had a lot of experience
going undercover at ATF.

38:30.577 --> 38:32.144
And he'd been here
the briefest.

38:32.212 --> 38:33.779
It would seem more plausible

38:33.847 --> 38:35.614
that he would turn
than anyone else.

38:41.119 --> 38:43.554
Why did he help Sykes
find Emily Lake and H.G.?

38:43.622 --> 38:45.790
Without him,
it wouldn't have happened.

38:45.858 --> 38:47.625
His orders were
to embed himself.

38:47.693 --> 38:49.127
Learn what Sykes' plan is.

38:49.195 --> 38:51.597
And even assist him
when needed.

38:54.068 --> 38:56.236
When Sykes enters
his end game,

38:56.303 --> 38:57.771
Agent Jinks will get us
a message.

38:57.838 --> 38:58.938
Oh,
we got the message.

38:59.006 --> 39:00.207
Skybrook Three.

39:00.274 --> 39:02.209
It's a decommissioned airport
in Featherhead.

39:02.276 --> 39:03.810
It must be hanger three.

39:03.878 --> 39:06.246
That son of a bitch was
under our noses the whole time.

39:06.313 --> 39:07.847
We're on our way there now.

39:07.915 --> 39:11.717
Pete, be careful.
I--

39:11.785 --> 39:12.985
I love you, too, Mom.

39:28.102 --> 39:29.936
Let's see if
this really works, huh?

39:30.004 --> 39:32.539
W-what are you doing?
What is that?

39:32.607 --> 39:34.175
The end of Emily Lake?

39:34.242 --> 39:35.509
No.

39:38.681 --> 39:41.149
Now, just remember.

39:41.217 --> 39:43.819
Just relax and remember.

40:08.942 --> 40:10.777
H.G. Wells?

40:16.417 --> 40:18.184
It would appear you got
to the coin

40:18.252 --> 40:20.152
before Pete could destroy it.

40:20.220 --> 40:21.553
You must be Mr. Sykes.

40:25.125 --> 40:26.625
It's a pleasure
to finally meet you.

40:30.930 --> 40:32.330
Um--

40:32.398 --> 40:35.967
the plane's ready
if you wanna go.

40:44.811 --> 40:46.645
Steve, I want you to know
none of this

40:46.713 --> 40:48.181
would have been possible
without your help, buddy.

41:13.443 --> 41:14.809
Damn it,
they're gone.

41:14.877 --> 41:17.045
Too late.

41:25.989 --> 41:27.456
Pete?

41:27.524 --> 41:29.357
What is it?
What's wrong?

41:29.425 --> 41:31.159
Nothing.
They're gone.

41:31.227 --> 41:32.727
Let's get back to the car.

41:32.795 --> 41:33.961
What's wrong?

41:34.029 --> 41:37.364
Claudia, I said
get back to the car!

41:37.432 --> 41:39.132
Pete?

41:39.200 --> 41:44.604
What is it?

41:44.672 --> 41:49.511
Please get back to the car.

41:53.517 --> 41:55.518
Pete...

41:55.543 --> 41:59.543
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

42:01.092 --> 42:04.761
No!

42:04.829 --> 42:08.465
Claudia!

42:08.533 --> 42:11.368
Claudia!

42:32.521 --> 42:36.521
<font color=#00FF00>♪ Warehouse 13 3x12 ♪</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Stand</font>
Original Air Date on October 3, 2011

42:36.522 --> 42:40.522
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

42:52.044 --> 42:53.010
Hey.

42:53.078 --> 42:55.847
I, uh, I told Artie.

42:55.914 --> 42:58.683
So the Regents are going
to send someone to get--

43:02.521 --> 43:07.225
for Steve.

43:07.292 --> 43:09.161
Pete?

43:10.429 --> 43:12.331
How could this happen?
It's--

43:17.370 --> 43:18.304
Claudia?

43:18.371 --> 43:19.572
Listen to me.

43:19.639 --> 43:21.773
We need you to hack
into that laptop, okay?

43:21.841 --> 43:23.709
There could be
something there that--

43:23.777 --> 43:25.377
Claude, listen to me.

43:25.445 --> 43:27.645
We need to find Sykes, right?

43:27.713 --> 43:28.913
We need to find him

43:28.981 --> 43:30.614
and we need to stop him.

43:30.682 --> 43:31.915
Claudia?

43:31.983 --> 43:34.751
Myka.

43:34.819 --> 43:35.785
Yeah?

43:35.853 --> 43:37.587
Steve is dead.

43:37.655 --> 43:39.923
How can you just be
business as usual?

43:39.990 --> 43:42.225
Because if I don't,

43:42.292 --> 43:45.061
I will lose it.

43:45.129 --> 43:46.930
So you need to help me.

43:57.642 --> 43:59.343
I'll stay with him.

44:17.164 --> 44:19.531
They ran a fat man
on the memory.

44:19.599 --> 44:20.966
What's a fat man?

44:21.033 --> 44:23.201
Fat man and little boy.
It's a deletion program.

44:23.269 --> 44:24.969
It's a hacker nuclear bomb.

44:25.037 --> 44:27.137
This hard drive is a crater.

44:33.310 --> 44:36.045
This was for nothing.

44:44.489 --> 44:47.258
Sykes needed H.G.
for something.

44:47.325 --> 44:48.793
We need to find him.

44:48.860 --> 44:49.694
Oh, we're gonna find him.

44:49.761 --> 44:52.598
And when we find him...

44:52.665 --> 44:54.767
We're gonna get payback.

45:03.309 --> 45:06.045
You're not too talkative,
Ms. Wells.

45:06.113 --> 45:07.780
Penny for your thoughts?

45:07.847 --> 45:10.382
You killed that young man
in cold blood.

45:10.449 --> 45:12.150
Really?

45:12.218 --> 45:15.453
What temperature
was your blood when you killed?

45:15.521 --> 45:17.087
'Cause you got a bigger body
count than I do.

45:17.155 --> 45:18.689
And I'm seriously considering

45:18.757 --> 45:21.425
adding one more to that list.

45:21.493 --> 45:22.460
Go ahead.

45:23.896 --> 45:25.730
Go ahead.

45:25.798 --> 45:26.698
Go ahead.

45:26.766 --> 45:28.066
Go on.

45:29.769 --> 45:33.606
Kill me.

45:33.674 --> 45:36.776
Cecil B. Demille's riding crop.

45:36.844 --> 45:37.944
Look at that.

45:38.012 --> 45:41.146
Lets my mind control your body.

45:41.214 --> 45:42.882
It's pretty damn cool,
don't you think?

45:45.685 --> 45:46.952
What do you want from me?

45:47.020 --> 45:48.320
Some advice.

45:48.388 --> 45:51.590
I'd strongly recommend
a good psychologist.

45:56.261 --> 45:58.795
Advice on what?

45:58.863 --> 46:02.599
Opening a certain lock.

46:02.667 --> 46:06.103
According to this,

46:06.171 --> 46:08.071
you got an old friend
who taught you

46:08.139 --> 46:09.273
how to do it, right?

46:09.340 --> 46:10.774
Something named Caturanga.

46:10.842 --> 46:12.677
Ms. Wells?

46:17.917 --> 46:20.018
What do you smell?

46:20.085 --> 46:23.020
Ms. Wells?

46:23.088 --> 46:25.255
What do you smell?

46:25.323 --> 46:26.456
Apples?

46:26.524 --> 46:28.892
Yes. You do.

46:28.960 --> 46:31.595
Most people do not
smell the apples.

46:31.663 --> 46:33.263
The Warehouse likes you.

46:33.331 --> 46:35.666
Buildings do not have
personal affinities, sir.

46:35.733 --> 46:38.435
This is not,
as you will discover,

46:38.503 --> 46:41.003
just a building,
Miss Wells.

46:41.071 --> 46:44.674
Welcome to Warehouse 12.

46:44.742 --> 46:45.975
I am Caturanga.

46:46.043 --> 46:47.310
And you're in charge here?

46:47.378 --> 46:49.346
Oh, no! My job is to teach

46:49.413 --> 46:51.748
and to solve puzzles,

46:51.816 --> 46:52.716
we shall say.

46:52.784 --> 46:54.117
What kind of puzzles?

46:54.185 --> 46:56.887
Many sorts,
and to design them, too.

46:56.954 --> 47:01.725
Sometimes to house a dangerous
artifact, like that one.

47:01.793 --> 47:02.960
Uh-uh-ah.

47:03.028 --> 47:05.696
Sometimes, to brew
the perfect cup of tea.

47:05.764 --> 47:06.964
This is England,

47:07.032 --> 47:09.033
so a good cup of tea
is not hard to find.

47:09.101 --> 47:10.034
Yes,

47:10.102 --> 47:12.370
but...

47:12.437 --> 47:15.106
The perfect cup of tea--

47:15.173 --> 47:16.574
that's a puzzle.

47:17.777 --> 47:18.810
I've read some
of your stories.

47:18.878 --> 47:20.745
You are very gifted.

47:20.813 --> 47:23.348
I thought my imagination
knew no boundary,

47:23.415 --> 47:24.349
but to stand here,

47:24.416 --> 47:27.452
amidst this wonderment--

47:28.521 --> 47:31.990
There's always more to learn.

47:32.058 --> 47:33.792
I will teach you.

47:35.995 --> 47:38.230
I'll die before I help you.

47:38.298 --> 47:40.866
Oh, you'll help me.

47:40.934 --> 47:43.169
Whether you live or die
is entirely up to you.

47:47.173 --> 47:49.274
It doesn't get easier,
does it?

47:49.342 --> 47:51.009
To lose a fellow Agent.

47:51.077 --> 47:52.978
I've lost fellow agents...

47:53.045 --> 47:55.046
partners,

47:55.114 --> 47:56.614
friends,

47:56.682 --> 47:58.183
Steve...

47:58.251 --> 48:00.152
he was my responsibility.

48:00.219 --> 48:05.590
You might have told me
that he was undercover.

48:05.658 --> 48:06.958
Are you angry?

48:07.025 --> 48:08.726
Does it matter?

48:08.794 --> 48:10.661
There's always a cost.

48:19.804 --> 48:20.905
What is Sykes planning?

48:20.972 --> 48:22.273
And how are
we going to stop him?

48:22.341 --> 48:24.342
The Regents are
assembling to regroup.

48:24.410 --> 48:28.113
I'll keep you posted.

48:28.180 --> 48:30.949
The Warehouse has
always endured, Arthur.

48:37.123 --> 48:39.157
Remember this watch?

48:39.225 --> 48:40.959
Used to argue over it.

48:41.027 --> 48:43.529
I think you should have it.

48:43.597 --> 48:45.664
Good luck, old friend.

48:45.732 --> 48:47.299
I imagine you're
going to need it.

49:31.644 --> 49:33.511
You guys all right?

49:39.384 --> 49:40.618
We are...

49:40.686 --> 49:44.589
On the other side of the world
from all right.

49:44.657 --> 49:45.890
How did they do it?

49:45.958 --> 49:48.160
An injection.

49:48.227 --> 49:50.829
They made it look
like a heart attack.

49:50.897 --> 49:52.464
Found this stuff on him.

49:52.532 --> 49:54.500
I didn't even know
the guy smoked.

49:54.568 --> 49:56.569
He didn't.

49:56.636 --> 50:00.306
His father was a chain smoker.
Steve hated smoking.

50:03.610 --> 50:06.046
That's my boy.

50:06.113 --> 50:08.515
What is that?

50:08.583 --> 50:10.384
Steve doing his job.

50:17.258 --> 50:19.826
Hey, guys.

50:19.894 --> 50:21.061
Bad news is
if you're watching this,

50:21.128 --> 50:24.264
I'm probably screwed.

50:24.332 --> 50:26.899
So, I'll keep it short.

50:26.967 --> 50:29.168
Still nothing
on Sykes' end game.

50:29.236 --> 50:31.471
He plays it
pretty close to the vest.

50:31.538 --> 50:32.705
But I can tell you
that he's made

50:32.773 --> 50:33.840
travel arrangements
to Hong Kong.

50:33.908 --> 50:35.141
I don't know why.

50:35.209 --> 50:36.576
But it's definitely
not a pleasure trip.

50:36.643 --> 50:37.977
There's one other thing.

50:38.045 --> 50:40.146
Sykes' number two--
Marcus Diamond--

50:40.214 --> 50:41.281
the guy who doesn't die,

50:41.349 --> 50:42.749
something's strange about him.

50:42.817 --> 50:44.317
He gets this look
when Sykes brings out

50:44.385 --> 50:45.351
this wooden box.

50:45.419 --> 50:46.319
It's probably an artifact.

50:46.387 --> 50:48.855
Artie, you should check it out.

50:48.923 --> 50:50.790
Agent Steve Jinks signing off.

50:50.858 --> 50:52.959
Good luck, you guys.

50:53.027 --> 50:55.429
Claude.

50:55.496 --> 51:00.366
Keep the faith.

51:02.002 --> 51:03.870
Good work, Jinxy.

51:03.937 --> 51:06.005
Indeed.

51:06.072 --> 51:08.173
Agent Jinks may have given us

51:08.241 --> 51:10.509
the final piece to the puzzle.

51:10.576 --> 51:12.044
Why?
What's in Hong Kong?

51:12.111 --> 51:15.780
Something we thought was gone
and buried forever.

51:15.848 --> 51:17.482
Walter Sykes may have uncovered

51:17.549 --> 51:20.385
the ancient Regent Sanctum.

51:28.543 --> 51:29.810
If the Regent Sanctum
was constructed

51:29.878 --> 51:32.180
during the era
of Warehouse 7,

51:32.247 --> 51:35.183
it predates H.G. by centuries.

51:35.250 --> 51:37.118
What does Sykes want with her?

51:37.186 --> 51:38.420
No idea.

51:38.487 --> 51:39.554
All knowledge of the sanctum

51:39.622 --> 51:40.822
was purged
from warehouse records

51:40.890 --> 51:42.191
when it was finally
shut down for good.

51:42.258 --> 51:44.226
That was over 100 years ago.

51:44.294 --> 51:45.294
And...

51:45.362 --> 51:46.662
if it was just
a meeting place,

51:46.729 --> 51:47.963
why would he even care about it?

51:48.030 --> 51:49.531
I got it.
Three tickets to Hong Kong.

51:49.599 --> 51:51.133
Purchased from
Tyler's IP address.

51:51.200 --> 51:52.134
Three?

51:52.201 --> 51:54.169
Sykes, Tyler, Marcus, H.G.?

51:54.237 --> 51:56.004
Somebody did not make that trip.

51:56.072 --> 51:57.172
They're gonna get there
before us.

51:57.240 --> 51:58.407
And he has an advantage.

51:58.475 --> 52:01.344
He knows where it is,
and we don't.

52:01.411 --> 52:02.878
I found this
in the Escher Vault.

52:02.946 --> 52:05.381
It was worn by the Regents
of Warehouse 7.

52:05.449 --> 52:06.782
Claudia?

52:06.850 --> 52:09.118
See if you can get us
the history on this thing.

52:09.186 --> 52:10.152
Wait.

52:10.220 --> 52:11.387
That's the Chinese symbol for...

52:11.454 --> 52:12.888
Aperture.

52:12.956 --> 52:15.591
Aperture could be a facility
that manufactures cameras?

52:15.659 --> 52:17.827
Or a location
that acts as an aperture.

52:17.895 --> 52:19.996
Somewhere, light hits
a certain way.

52:20.063 --> 52:22.131
Oh, how very Indiana Jones.

52:22.198 --> 52:24.133
The roads.
The--the--the roads in--

52:24.200 --> 52:25.134
Roads, I remember--

52:25.201 --> 52:26.135
there's something--

52:26.202 --> 52:28.971
See, the roads kind of--

52:29.039 --> 52:30.773
see that? They connect...

52:30.840 --> 52:31.774
In almost forms a--

52:31.841 --> 52:32.942
Might see the--

52:33.009 --> 52:33.976
You two know
you haven't actually

52:34.044 --> 52:35.545
finished a sentence yet,
right?

52:35.612 --> 52:37.947
Well, the same symbol
that--that means aperture

52:38.015 --> 52:39.749
can also mean eye.

52:39.817 --> 52:41.051
As in...

52:41.119 --> 52:42.352
The eye of Horus.

52:42.420 --> 52:45.989
Now, look, this is
Hong Kong circa...1600.

52:46.056 --> 52:48.324
These roads--the roads today,

52:48.392 --> 52:50.059
are all based on these roads.

52:50.127 --> 52:53.162
And--take a look at this.
Look.

52:53.230 --> 52:55.030
The roads form
an Eye of Horus.

52:55.098 --> 52:56.632
Iris of the eye.

52:56.699 --> 52:57.799
It's a city.
Tai Po.

52:57.867 --> 52:59.301
Good a place to start as any.

52:59.369 --> 53:01.203
We'll, uh, we'll check in
when we get there.

53:04.674 --> 53:06.375
Claudia...

53:06.442 --> 53:07.609
I think it'd be a good idea--

53:07.677 --> 53:11.113
Excuse me.

53:11.181 --> 53:13.016
Claudia?

53:19.858 --> 53:21.993
You have every right
to be angry.

53:22.061 --> 53:24.829
Agents Jinks was a good man.

53:24.897 --> 53:26.531
And what happened was a tragedy.

53:26.598 --> 53:28.099
And?

53:28.166 --> 53:30.200
And what?

53:30.268 --> 53:34.204
And I'm really sorry
I sent him to his death?

53:34.271 --> 53:36.139
Steve died alone.

53:36.206 --> 53:37.573
Cut off from everybody
who had his back.

53:37.641 --> 53:38.574
And for what?

53:38.642 --> 53:40.042
Why?

53:40.110 --> 53:42.110
Agent Jinks did not want
to put any of you at risk.

53:42.178 --> 53:43.712
He volunteered for--

53:43.779 --> 53:45.914
To take down Walter Sykes
for the good of the world.

53:45.982 --> 53:47.482
But let's face it, Jane.

53:47.550 --> 53:49.517
This was never about
the good of the world, was it?

53:49.585 --> 53:53.689
This was about your guilt.

53:53.757 --> 53:55.257
You made Walter Sykes.

53:55.325 --> 53:56.258
No, Claudia.

53:56.326 --> 53:58.027
I tried to prevent Walter Sykes

53:58.095 --> 53:59.329
from being made.

53:59.396 --> 54:00.697
If we had gotten
to the artifact in time--

54:00.764 --> 54:02.899
But you didn't and he became
a psychopathic killer.

54:02.967 --> 54:05.168
And now all you care about
is fixing your mistake,

54:05.236 --> 54:06.736
no matter who gets hurt
or killed along the way.

54:06.804 --> 54:08.437
That's not true!
It's just not--

54:11.908 --> 54:13.342
You're upset.

54:13.409 --> 54:15.110
This is not the time to discuss
whether Agent Jinks was--

54:15.178 --> 54:16.111
Steve!

54:16.179 --> 54:18.813
His name was Steve.

54:18.881 --> 54:20.982
You know,
I see you and the Regents

54:21.050 --> 54:24.585
for what you really are.

54:24.653 --> 54:27.355
Cowards.

54:27.423 --> 54:29.190
Steve was worth
a thousand of you.

54:43.366 --> 54:45.066
This is exactly
where the eye would be,

54:45.134 --> 54:47.702
but maybe it's
just a restaurant.

54:47.770 --> 54:50.572
Then why did I get a vibe
that almost knocked me over?

54:50.640 --> 54:53.341
I'm here in a Chinese
restaurant, Myks.

54:53.409 --> 54:54.877
And I'm not hungry.

54:54.944 --> 54:57.279
I know there's something here.

54:57.347 --> 54:59.983
We--we are at the dead center
of the city,

55:00.050 --> 55:01.818
and--

55:01.885 --> 55:02.852
What?

55:02.920 --> 55:04.154
What is it?

55:04.222 --> 55:07.558
If the sanctum was built
that long ago...

55:07.625 --> 55:10.060
What if the restaurant
isn't the sanctum?

55:13.230 --> 55:14.964
What if it's on top...

55:15.031 --> 55:16.899
of the sanctum?

55:29.312 --> 55:32.014
Well, I would say that
we're in the right place.

55:34.451 --> 55:35.785
What do you got?

55:35.852 --> 55:38.454
Well, I doubt H.G.
and a stock boy

55:38.522 --> 55:40.356
wear the same locket.

55:50.634 --> 55:52.501
Somebody there?

56:07.751 --> 56:09.319
Nothing.

56:09.386 --> 56:10.720
I don't know.

56:10.788 --> 56:14.591
Maybe they realized
it was the wrong place and left.

56:15.759 --> 56:16.726
But...

56:16.794 --> 56:18.761
why do I still have a vibe?

56:18.829 --> 56:21.563
Because H.G. left
that locket as a clue.

56:21.631 --> 56:23.699
I know it.

56:23.767 --> 56:24.667
Pete?

56:24.735 --> 56:25.668
Yeah?

56:25.736 --> 56:27.136
Look at this.

56:27.204 --> 56:28.971
It looks like something swept

56:29.039 --> 56:30.440
across the floor.

56:33.010 --> 56:33.943
What is it?

56:34.011 --> 56:34.944
A--like a--

56:35.011 --> 56:37.279
a door, or...

56:37.347 --> 56:40.783
Opening?

56:40.850 --> 56:42.684
Maybe we can--

56:50.092 --> 56:52.461
the Eye of Horus.

56:52.528 --> 56:54.263
I believe the phrase is

56:54.330 --> 56:56.165
aha.

57:19.223 --> 57:21.958
Please, Mr. Sykes,
don't make me do this.

57:22.026 --> 57:25.862
Tyler, make the move
the lady suggested.

57:25.930 --> 57:28.031
Now.

57:28.098 --> 57:29.465
This is lunacy.

57:29.533 --> 57:31.168
It's not a move.
It's a guess.

57:31.235 --> 57:32.669
I don't care.

57:32.737 --> 57:34.471
We don't know
if we don't play.

57:34.539 --> 57:35.472
Now move that piece.

57:40.545 --> 57:42.213
The first two were wrong.

57:42.280 --> 57:43.213
The third could--

57:43.281 --> 57:47.251
Enough!

57:47.319 --> 57:48.586
Tyler,

57:48.654 --> 57:50.188
what are you waiting for?

57:50.255 --> 57:52.856
Look at those skulls.
They're all cracked in half.

57:52.924 --> 57:54.825
Yeah, I think I see why.

57:59.763 --> 58:00.830
Please, Mr. Sykes.

58:00.898 --> 58:02.865
Don't make him do it.

58:02.933 --> 58:04.099
Tyler,

58:04.167 --> 58:06.635
you got to be in it
to win it.

58:06.702 --> 58:08.136
Now.

58:13.542 --> 58:17.178
Good lad.

58:17.246 --> 58:18.346
Checkmate.

58:22.185 --> 58:24.619
No!

58:27.491 --> 58:29.158
First show's over.

58:29.226 --> 58:30.793
Lattimer and Bering?

58:30.861 --> 58:32.696
Come on down!

58:36.333 --> 58:37.734
Myka, are you all right?

58:37.801 --> 58:38.735
I didn't do that.

58:38.802 --> 58:40.403
No, I'm--I'm fine.

58:40.471 --> 58:42.305
Myka, that's only because
I control where she shot.

58:42.372 --> 58:44.073
Next time, her aim is going
to be a lot better.

58:44.141 --> 58:45.175
Okay?
Let's go, guys.

58:45.242 --> 58:47.110
Guns on the floor, please?

58:50.514 --> 58:52.849
Or the next shot is going
to be right between

58:52.916 --> 58:54.750
Ms. Bering's beautiful eyes.

59:16.605 --> 59:17.805
You son of a--

59:19.408 --> 59:21.342
Stop it!

59:21.409 --> 59:22.343
I don't understand.

59:22.410 --> 59:23.844
Why is there a torture device

59:23.912 --> 59:25.079
in the Regent Sanctum?

59:25.147 --> 59:27.347
It's not a torture device,
honey.

59:27.415 --> 59:28.683
It's a lock.

59:28.750 --> 59:31.185
It was invented
by a man named Caturanga.

59:31.253 --> 59:32.419
He was rather the Claudia

59:32.487 --> 59:34.221
of Warehouse 12

59:34.289 --> 59:35.623
and my teacher.

59:35.691 --> 59:38.026
That's why you needed Helena
to open it.

59:38.093 --> 59:40.929
She's the only living person
who knew this...

59:40.997 --> 59:42.431
Caturanga.

59:42.498 --> 59:44.233
See, the pieces are set
so the player's in check.

59:44.300 --> 59:45.234
You win the game,

59:45.301 --> 59:46.569
and the lock opens.

59:46.637 --> 59:47.670
You lose the game,

59:47.738 --> 59:49.172
and your skull opens.

59:49.240 --> 59:51.408
When the Regents shut down
the Sanctum a century ago,

59:51.476 --> 59:54.245
Caturanga designed the lock.

59:54.313 --> 59:56.414
Now, the secret to opening it

59:56.482 --> 59:57.882
is not in the journals.

59:57.950 --> 59:59.617
But he writes a lot about
Ms. Wells, here.

59:59.684 --> 01:00:01.152
She's his favorite student.

01:00:01.219 --> 01:00:02.753
I think she knows about it.

01:00:02.821 --> 01:00:04.421
Caturanga taught me
a thousand things,

01:00:04.489 --> 01:00:07.056
but I have never seen
the chess lock before.

01:00:07.124 --> 01:00:08.558
I don't know how to open it.

01:00:08.625 --> 01:00:09.458
I know, and you
clearly demonstrated

01:00:09.526 --> 01:00:10.459
with young Tyler, here.

01:00:10.527 --> 01:00:11.493
You did that.

01:00:11.561 --> 01:00:12.828
I tried to stop you!

01:00:12.896 --> 01:00:13.829
I swear it.

01:00:13.896 --> 01:00:14.963
You know what?

01:00:15.031 --> 01:00:17.599
Maybe I used
the wrong incentive.

01:00:17.667 --> 01:00:18.767
No!

01:00:19.903 --> 01:00:20.970
Myka!
Myka!

01:00:23.073 --> 01:00:26.375
Now that there's somebody
in the chair you care about,

01:00:26.443 --> 01:00:29.245
maybe your memory
will come back.

01:00:42.359 --> 01:00:43.426
What is that?

01:00:43.494 --> 01:00:45.127
A gift from
a former employer.

01:00:45.195 --> 01:00:47.696
What do you want from me?
I'm just an innkeeper.

01:00:47.764 --> 01:00:52.300
Oh, we both know you're
more than that, don't we?

01:00:52.368 --> 01:00:54.302
If you think
that I'm gonna help you

01:00:54.370 --> 01:00:55.470
break into the warehouse,

01:00:55.538 --> 01:00:57.105
you're in for a surprise.

01:00:57.173 --> 01:00:58.540
No.

01:00:58.607 --> 01:01:00.642
No, you see,
it's you people

01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:02.544
who are gonna be surprised.

01:01:19.732 --> 01:01:21.666
What is that?

01:01:21.734 --> 01:01:23.901
Something's wrong at Leena's.
Pull up the security feed.

01:01:23.969 --> 01:01:25.770
Way ahead of you.

01:01:30.608 --> 01:01:33.476
It's him.

01:01:33.544 --> 01:01:35.078
Leena.

01:01:35.145 --> 01:01:36.246
Ah!

01:01:36.313 --> 01:01:39.649
All right, all right.

01:01:39.717 --> 01:01:42.319
If we unlock this thing,
what are we going to find?

01:01:42.386 --> 01:01:43.853
You'll see.

01:01:43.921 --> 01:01:45.989
Have you considered that we
might be unlocking an artifact

01:01:46.057 --> 01:01:48.959
deemed too dangerous to be kept
in Warehouse 7?

01:01:49.027 --> 01:01:50.461
She's right, you know.

01:01:50.529 --> 01:01:52.030
The Regents must have had
a reason to keep people out.

01:01:52.097 --> 01:01:53.464
Don't tell me
about the Regents

01:01:53.532 --> 01:01:54.866
or the reasons, okay?

01:01:54.934 --> 01:01:56.068
You have one choice.

01:01:56.135 --> 01:01:57.970
Open the lock,

01:01:58.038 --> 01:01:59.004
or she's gonna die.

01:01:59.072 --> 01:02:00.606
Now, how do we beat it?

01:02:00.674 --> 01:02:02.374
This was Caturanga's passion.

01:02:02.442 --> 01:02:04.309
We played every day for years.

01:02:04.377 --> 01:02:05.643
You beat him all the time?

01:02:05.711 --> 01:02:07.645
Not once.

01:02:09.214 --> 01:02:10.748
Oh, great.

01:02:10.816 --> 01:02:11.816
All right.

01:02:11.884 --> 01:02:16.087
Time to make a move.

01:02:16.155 --> 01:02:20.490
With Tyler, I--I chose
the King's gambit.

01:02:20.558 --> 01:02:22.793
Caturanga would have
expected that.

01:02:22.861 --> 01:02:26.597
Perhaps--

01:02:26.665 --> 01:02:30.268
yes, perhaps
the--the Dragon's variant.

01:02:30.335 --> 01:02:31.602
Myka,

01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:34.472
King's Knight...

01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:36.407
to E-6.

01:02:49.855 --> 01:02:51.222
Check.

01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:57.562
You're distracting
the player, Pete.

01:03:04.737 --> 01:03:07.005
Queen's Bishop...

01:03:07.073 --> 01:03:09.941
to h-4.

01:03:23.256 --> 01:03:24.523
Check.

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:29.227
I don't know what else to do!

01:03:29.295 --> 01:03:30.295
Helena.

01:03:30.363 --> 01:03:31.796
Continuing.

01:03:31.864 --> 01:03:33.198
Sorry, Myka.

01:03:33.265 --> 01:03:35.100
Helena, listen to me.

01:03:35.168 --> 01:03:37.836
I am not going to die
here today, okay?

01:03:37.904 --> 01:03:39.905
Because you are going
to take a breath,

01:03:39.973 --> 01:03:42.574
and you're gonna save my life.

01:03:42.642 --> 01:03:45.043
This isn't
what I signed up for.

01:03:45.111 --> 01:03:47.478
These Regents of yours are
gravely mistaken

01:03:47.546 --> 01:03:49.780
if they think I shall be
carrying around this.

01:03:49.848 --> 01:03:51.648
The Webley Mark One
.450 caliber,

01:03:51.716 --> 01:03:54.551
standard issue of the Royal Navy
and police constabularies.

01:03:54.618 --> 01:03:55.585
A fine weapon.

01:03:55.653 --> 01:03:56.586
Guns have no place

01:03:56.654 --> 01:03:59.355
in a civilized society, sir.

01:03:59.423 --> 01:04:01.057
Now, the Regents
set the rules,

01:04:01.125 --> 01:04:02.693
and their rules states

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:05.329
all warehouse agents
must carry a firearm.

01:04:05.397 --> 01:04:07.566
But there is always
an alternative to killing.

01:04:07.633 --> 01:04:11.069
I agree.

01:04:11.137 --> 01:04:14.139
That is not standard issue.

01:04:14.207 --> 01:04:15.541
I changed the rules.

01:04:15.608 --> 01:04:16.542
Wells,

01:04:16.609 --> 01:04:18.010
time for target practice.

01:04:23.049 --> 01:04:24.250
Is he dead?

01:04:24.317 --> 01:04:25.918
No, no.

01:04:25.986 --> 01:04:28.687
Agent McShane
is merely stunned.

01:04:28.755 --> 01:04:32.391
When the rules do not
agree with one,

01:04:32.459 --> 01:04:35.994
it is sometimes necessary
to change them.

01:04:36.062 --> 01:04:37.529
Change the rules.

01:04:37.597 --> 01:04:39.031
What?

01:04:39.098 --> 01:04:40.566
Change the rules.

01:04:40.633 --> 01:04:41.700
Myka,

01:04:41.768 --> 01:04:42.935
D-3...

01:04:43.003 --> 01:04:44.403
to E-8.

01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:45.838
Helena, I-I--

01:04:45.906 --> 01:04:47.741
I can't move my pawn like that.

01:04:47.808 --> 01:04:48.909
I know.

01:04:48.976 --> 01:04:50.811
Change the rules.

01:05:08.865 --> 01:05:10.332
Checkmate.

01:05:13.436 --> 01:05:17.706
Whatever it is,
I think it's about to open.

01:05:21.544 --> 01:05:23.378
Do it.

01:05:35.093 --> 01:05:36.827
Artie, what's that?

01:05:36.895 --> 01:05:37.862
Black Barty's Cannon.

01:05:37.929 --> 01:05:39.130
Black Barty?

01:05:39.197 --> 01:05:40.465
Black Barty was one
of the most successful

01:05:40.532 --> 01:05:41.866
pirate captains
of the golden age.

01:05:41.933 --> 01:05:43.534
And his cannon from his ship

01:05:43.602 --> 01:05:47.071
was rumored to have
artifact-augmented firepower.

01:05:47.138 --> 01:05:48.572
Are you telling me
that Walter Sykes' plan

01:05:48.639 --> 01:05:50.807
is to fire a cannonball
at the Warehouse?

01:05:50.875 --> 01:05:52.141
A cannonball
wouldn't worry me,

01:05:52.209 --> 01:05:54.110
but a cannonball
from that cannon?

01:05:54.178 --> 01:05:56.178
I'm approaching worry.

01:05:56.246 --> 01:05:57.146
I'm not.

01:06:00.616 --> 01:06:01.583
What the hell's happening?

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:31.814
What just happened?

01:06:31.882 --> 01:06:33.349
The Remati Shackle
sensed an attack

01:06:33.416 --> 01:06:36.519
and activated a protective
barrier around the Warehouse.

01:06:36.586 --> 01:06:37.520
We're safe.

01:06:37.587 --> 01:06:38.653
I gotta get to Leena's.

01:06:38.721 --> 01:06:39.855
Once the shackle
is activated,

01:06:39.922 --> 01:06:42.090
I'm afraid no one
can get in or out.

01:06:42.158 --> 01:06:43.091
Claudia!

01:06:43.159 --> 01:06:44.125
I want you to--

01:06:44.193 --> 01:06:45.126
Artie,

01:06:45.194 --> 01:06:46.828
I have a bad feeling.

01:06:46.896 --> 01:06:49.197
I have a bad vibe.

01:06:49.265 --> 01:06:51.232
But you said
that nothing could get in

01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:52.767
once the barrier was up.

01:06:52.835 --> 01:06:54.101
True, but it can't stop

01:06:54.169 --> 01:06:55.937
something
that's already inside.

01:07:18.897 --> 01:07:22.500
The Regents wanted
to know our vulnerability.

01:07:22.567 --> 01:07:24.935
I think we just found it.

01:07:27.205 --> 01:07:28.772
Amazing.
The warehouse.

01:07:34.645 --> 01:07:36.179
You guys! Run!

01:07:43.622 --> 01:07:45.590
Bastard.

01:07:45.658 --> 01:07:46.491
No!

01:08:07.247 --> 01:08:08.615
No.

01:08:08.683 --> 01:08:10.517
They must have shut it down
from the other side.

01:08:10.584 --> 01:08:12.285
I hope you don't mind.

01:08:12.353 --> 01:08:15.522
I let myself in.

01:08:15.590 --> 01:08:18.626
Initiating the barrier
automatically triggered

01:08:18.693 --> 01:08:20.227
the emergency exit portal--

01:08:20.295 --> 01:08:22.363
To the ancient sanctum.

01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:24.163
When the Regents
abandoned the portal,

01:08:24.232 --> 01:08:25.532
they locked it up,
but it wasn't enough

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:27.100
just to trigger
on one side.

01:08:27.169 --> 01:08:29.437
You had to unlock
the Hong Kong side as well.

01:08:29.505 --> 01:08:30.872
Which is why you needed H.G.

01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:32.808
You'd have been
proud of her.

01:08:32.876 --> 01:08:33.975
She only killed
one guy doing it.

01:08:34.044 --> 01:08:36.045
Peter, are you hurt?

01:08:36.112 --> 01:08:37.145
No.

01:08:37.214 --> 01:08:38.848
A little tired
of this guy, though.

01:08:38.916 --> 01:08:40.550
You'll never get
what you want.

01:08:40.618 --> 01:08:42.252
Difference of opinion, Jane.

01:08:42.319 --> 01:08:44.187
See, I think I'm gonna get
exactly what I want.

01:08:44.254 --> 01:08:45.555
Artie, no!

01:08:47.723 --> 01:08:48.622
Oh!

01:08:48.691 --> 01:08:49.825
Artie!

01:08:49.892 --> 01:08:51.059
That'll be
your only warning.

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:52.460
Play nice.

01:08:52.528 --> 01:08:53.928
Artie, I'm sorry.

01:08:53.996 --> 01:08:55.196
It's his crop.

01:08:55.263 --> 01:08:56.529
It's got wicked mojo.
Are you okay?

01:08:56.598 --> 01:08:58.265
I've been better.

01:08:58.332 --> 01:08:59.600
Why don't you just kill us?

01:08:59.667 --> 01:09:01.502
I'm going to.

01:09:01.569 --> 01:09:03.504
But we're going to go find
the Collodi Bracelet, first.

01:09:03.571 --> 01:09:04.805
And this time, Jane,

01:09:04.872 --> 01:09:08.808
you're going to watch your son
hand it to me.

01:09:08.876 --> 01:09:12.578
There's gotta be another way
to open this. I just--

01:09:12.645 --> 01:09:14.514
I have to think.

01:09:16.649 --> 01:09:18.850
Myka,

01:09:18.919 --> 01:09:21.620
I'm sorry.

01:09:21.688 --> 01:09:24.089
About what?

01:09:24.157 --> 01:09:25.791
You should have destroyed
the Janus coin

01:09:25.859 --> 01:09:27.126
the moment you found it.

01:09:27.193 --> 01:09:28.961
Then I wouldn't have caused
all of this.

01:09:29.028 --> 01:09:30.761
I wish that you would stop
doing that.

01:09:30.830 --> 01:09:31.729
Doing what?

01:09:31.796 --> 01:09:33.064
You're not the bad guy, okay?

01:09:33.131 --> 01:09:34.564
I believed in you,
and I was right.

01:09:34.633 --> 01:09:36.801
So get off your--your cross,

01:09:36.868 --> 01:09:40.470
and help me figure this out.

01:09:41.706 --> 01:09:43.908
Righty-ho, then.

01:09:43.975 --> 01:09:45.309
Old times,

01:09:45.377 --> 01:09:46.544
Wells and Bering,

01:09:46.612 --> 01:09:48.580
solving puzzles,
saving the day.

01:09:48.648 --> 01:09:50.482
Bering and Wells.

01:09:53.252 --> 01:09:56.088
There are consequences
to using the Collodi Bracelet.

01:09:56.156 --> 01:09:58.924
There were consequences
to not using it.

01:09:58.992 --> 01:10:00.826
It's a part of me.

01:10:00.894 --> 01:10:03.930
I close my eyes,
and I can see it.

01:10:03.998 --> 01:10:05.164
Without it,
there's a hole in my soul.

01:10:05.232 --> 01:10:06.632
That's what it does to you.

01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:07.667
It's not real.

01:10:07.734 --> 01:10:09.068
It's not a real need.

01:10:09.136 --> 01:10:11.971
It is real to me!

01:10:14.974 --> 01:10:16.074
Oh, no.

01:10:16.142 --> 01:10:17.409
Or did you not know that,
Jane?

01:10:17.476 --> 01:10:20.044
Wearing the bracelet creates
a insatiable longing--

01:10:20.112 --> 01:10:21.879
It hardens your heart.
It darkens your soul.

01:10:21.947 --> 01:10:23.648
And if we let you
keep the bracelet,

01:10:23.716 --> 01:10:25.150
you never would have
been able to love,

01:10:25.217 --> 01:10:26.318
or be loved.

01:10:26.385 --> 01:10:27.685
If you did everything right,

01:10:27.753 --> 01:10:29.087
then why are we here?

01:10:29.154 --> 01:10:30.588
We didn't get to you
soon enough.

01:10:30.656 --> 01:10:33.225
The seeds of darkness
had already taken root.

01:10:33.293 --> 01:10:34.893
You've killed
a lot of people, Walter.

01:10:34.961 --> 01:10:36.962
But I take responsibility
for that.

01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:38.330
Oh, that's big of you,
Jane.

01:10:38.398 --> 01:10:39.665
It's not too late.

01:10:39.733 --> 01:10:42.401
We could still try to save you.

01:10:42.469 --> 01:10:43.936
Mom, please.

01:10:44.004 --> 01:10:45.538
I don't think
you're going to hurt me.

01:10:45.605 --> 01:10:47.906
I think you understand
what I'm saying.

01:10:47.974 --> 01:10:51.309
I think you know there's been
enough damage done.

01:10:51.377 --> 01:10:53.011
I think you're ready
to stop this.

01:10:53.079 --> 01:10:56.714
But, Jane,
then you'd have solace.

01:10:56.782 --> 01:11:00.184
I want you to feel
the guilt and the pain.

01:11:00.252 --> 01:11:01.585
Like I have.

01:11:01.653 --> 01:11:03.220
You should have opted
for the opportunity

01:11:03.288 --> 01:11:05.623
I just gave you.

01:11:05.690 --> 01:11:08.559
I will take the risk.

01:11:08.627 --> 01:11:11.462
And the bracelet.

01:11:11.530 --> 01:11:13.364
Pete?

01:11:23.207 --> 01:11:25.008
Marcus.

01:11:25.076 --> 01:11:26.910
I have it.

01:11:26.978 --> 01:11:28.411
Go ahead.

01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:32.650
You'll never win.

01:11:32.718 --> 01:11:33.885
Pete and Myka and the others--

01:11:33.953 --> 01:11:35.019
they'll fight back.

01:11:35.087 --> 01:11:38.657
Possibly.

01:11:40.059 --> 01:11:41.960
But you would have had
a heart attack by then.

01:11:42.027 --> 01:11:43.995
Put that syringe down,
Mr. Diamond.

01:11:46.965 --> 01:11:47.898
I'm impressed.

01:11:47.965 --> 01:11:49.099
Imagine my delight.

01:11:49.166 --> 01:11:51.568
Drop it, please.

01:11:57.474 --> 01:11:59.408
It's about time.

01:11:59.475 --> 01:12:00.509
I didn't think
you'd let me kill her.

01:12:00.577 --> 01:12:02.144
And I knew you'd wait for me.

01:12:02.212 --> 01:12:03.479
You never should have come.

01:12:03.546 --> 01:12:06.182
I made you a promise
a long time ago.

01:12:06.249 --> 01:12:08.484
I honor my commitments.

01:12:08.552 --> 01:12:12.087
This is Marcus Diamond,
former Baltimore City Detective.

01:12:12.155 --> 01:12:13.856
Shot in the line of duty.

01:12:13.924 --> 01:12:15.858
Three times.

01:12:15.926 --> 01:12:16.859
Dead center.

01:12:16.927 --> 01:12:18.194
And you lived?

01:12:18.262 --> 01:12:19.862
Bullets are
still in his heart.

01:12:19.930 --> 01:12:21.030
If you know
that much about me,

01:12:21.098 --> 01:12:22.365
you know
that metal won't kill me.

01:12:22.433 --> 01:12:23.566
Yes.

01:12:23.634 --> 01:12:25.301
But it will cause you
unending pain.

01:12:25.369 --> 01:12:27.870
You have no idea
what's about to happen.

01:12:27.937 --> 01:12:29.538
Oh, but I do.

01:12:36.111 --> 01:12:39.347
Finally.

01:12:39.414 --> 01:12:41.282
Right where it belongs.

01:12:56.266 --> 01:12:58.634
You got what you wanted.

01:12:58.702 --> 01:12:59.635
Get out.

01:12:59.703 --> 01:13:01.470
No, this is just step one.

01:13:01.538 --> 01:13:02.738
Before you die,

01:13:02.806 --> 01:13:04.206
I want you to know
what it feels like

01:13:04.274 --> 01:13:05.274
when something you love

01:13:05.341 --> 01:13:07.175
is ripped away from you.

01:13:11.881 --> 01:13:13.147
No, please.

01:13:20.007 --> 01:13:20.940
I'm responsible.

01:13:21.008 --> 01:13:23.510
Kill me.

01:13:24.645 --> 01:13:25.612
Myka,

01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:26.613
thank God!

01:13:26.681 --> 01:13:29.917
Come on!

01:13:31.286 --> 01:13:32.219
You guys, circle around.

01:13:32.287 --> 01:13:33.888
Don't let him in the portal.

01:13:33.955 --> 01:13:36.823
Myka!

01:13:36.891 --> 01:13:38.191
H.G.!

01:13:38.259 --> 01:13:39.959
Rigging rope from
the <i>Mary Celeste.</i>

01:13:40.027 --> 01:13:41.127
Hang on.

01:13:41.194 --> 01:13:42.595
No, Myka, don't--

01:13:43.630 --> 01:13:45.330
Touch the rope?

01:13:45.398 --> 01:13:48.333
I imagine it's
the rest of that sentence.

01:13:50.770 --> 01:13:52.838
If you pull at it,
it only gets tighter.

01:13:52.906 --> 01:13:55.741
Oh, that's good to know.

01:13:58.479 --> 01:14:00.714
Will you ever learn
not to play with these things?

01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:07.155
Let's go.

01:14:24.639 --> 01:14:26.541
Hey...

01:14:26.608 --> 01:14:29.243
You're too young to have seen
the Frazier Ali fight, right?

01:14:29.311 --> 01:14:31.879
What?

01:14:31.947 --> 01:14:34.583
They never saw
his right uppercut coming.

01:14:38.154 --> 01:14:39.588
You know I think we're beyond

01:14:39.656 --> 01:14:41.824
needing to make your death
look like an accident.

01:14:41.892 --> 01:14:43.726
No!

01:14:54.472 --> 01:14:55.572
Claudia, what is that?

01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:58.441
No.

01:14:58.509 --> 01:15:02.011
This is
Johann Maelzel's metronome.

01:15:02.079 --> 01:15:04.847
Sykes uses it
to keep Marcus alive.

01:15:13.557 --> 01:15:15.391
That was for Steve.

01:15:27.270 --> 01:15:29.505
Thank God,
Myka left it open.

01:15:37.314 --> 01:15:39.148
Get away from her!

01:15:47.791 --> 01:15:49.592
Walk into this!

01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:52.128
Walter!

01:15:52.196 --> 01:15:54.230
Walter, take my hand.

01:16:05.143 --> 01:16:06.777
Mom.

01:16:06.845 --> 01:16:08.179
Are you--
are you okay?

01:16:08.246 --> 01:16:09.447
Yes.
You?

01:16:09.514 --> 01:16:10.648
Yeah.

01:16:10.715 --> 01:16:14.385
Walter Sykes
has left the building.

01:16:14.453 --> 01:16:16.220
The portal's kaput.

01:16:16.288 --> 01:16:19.123
And you're gonna need
to fly back.

01:16:19.191 --> 01:16:20.158
All right, so,

01:16:20.225 --> 01:16:21.459
get home safe, okay?

01:16:21.527 --> 01:16:23.928
And, um, Mom.

01:16:23.996 --> 01:16:25.530
I love you.

01:16:25.598 --> 01:16:27.633
I love you, too,
honey.

01:16:30.670 --> 01:16:31.670
Pete!

01:16:31.737 --> 01:16:32.937
What happened?
Where are they?

01:16:33.005 --> 01:16:34.572
What took you guys so long?

01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:36.674
Just lazy, I guess. Sykes?

01:16:36.742 --> 01:16:38.309
- Dead.
- Is Jane all right?

01:16:38.377 --> 01:16:39.743
Well, she's got
a 15-hour plane ride

01:16:39.811 --> 01:16:41.945
ahead of her,
but, yeah, she's okay.

01:16:57.963 --> 01:16:59.631
Thank you.

01:16:59.699 --> 01:17:02.768
Anytime.

01:17:09.609 --> 01:17:10.576
Claude, hey.

01:17:10.644 --> 01:17:11.811
Are you okay?

01:17:11.878 --> 01:17:13.045
Yes, and so are Leena
and Mrs. Frederic.

01:17:13.113 --> 01:17:14.513
Marcus is dead.

01:17:14.581 --> 01:17:16.081
It's over.

01:17:16.149 --> 01:17:17.750
Why is that light still--

01:17:17.818 --> 01:17:18.718
What--what is it?

01:17:18.785 --> 01:17:21.520
They're all--

01:17:21.588 --> 01:17:22.588
Artie?

01:17:22.655 --> 01:17:24.390
Artie, what's wrong?

01:17:26.526 --> 01:17:27.793
Wait.

01:17:27.861 --> 01:17:29.228
Mrs. Frederic.

01:17:29.296 --> 01:17:31.030
How long should the barrier
normally stay active?

01:17:31.098 --> 01:17:32.632
Once the danger
to the Warehouse passes,

01:17:32.699 --> 01:17:34.734
it dissipates instantly.

01:17:34.802 --> 01:17:36.336
Well, then,
why is it still up?

01:17:36.404 --> 01:17:39.473
The Warehouse isn't
in danger anymore.

01:17:39.541 --> 01:17:40.874
Is it?

01:17:40.942 --> 01:17:42.843
Was he just gonna collect
the Collodi artifact

01:17:42.911 --> 01:17:44.345
and walk out of here?

01:17:44.412 --> 01:17:45.980
He said he was
gonna kill us all,

01:17:46.048 --> 01:17:47.982
but he never tried to.

01:17:48.050 --> 01:17:51.519
A man who can walk
does not need--

01:17:51.587 --> 01:17:52.954
He planned
on leaving it behind.

01:17:55.691 --> 01:17:57.491
Yeah, but why?

01:18:03.599 --> 01:18:04.733
Uh-oh.

01:18:04.801 --> 01:18:06.368
I know that writing.

01:18:06.435 --> 01:18:08.503
That's from
the House of Commons in London.

01:18:08.571 --> 01:18:09.905
Oh, no.

01:18:09.973 --> 01:18:11.140
How bad?

01:18:11.207 --> 01:18:12.507
The House of Commons
was partially destroyed

01:18:12.575 --> 01:18:14.009
during the Blitzkrieg
of World War II.

01:18:14.076 --> 01:18:15.577
And there was
a piece of masonry.

01:18:15.645 --> 01:18:17.545
It was said to absorb
the concussive force

01:18:17.613 --> 01:18:23.117
of the entire German <i>Luftwaffe.</i>

01:18:23.185 --> 01:18:26.187
This is an artifact
nuclear device...

01:18:26.254 --> 01:18:27.655
and it's counting down.

01:18:34.730 --> 01:18:37.098
The Ovoid quarantine can offer
some protection

01:18:37.165 --> 01:18:39.066
to the rest of the Warehouse,
but I-I doubt it.

01:18:39.134 --> 01:18:40.034
I don't understand.

01:18:40.101 --> 01:18:41.836
I mean, who builds a force field

01:18:41.903 --> 01:18:43.137
that locks you in?

01:18:43.205 --> 01:18:46.040
Well, the barrier
was initiated first...

01:18:46.108 --> 01:18:48.276
as a way...

01:18:48.343 --> 01:18:50.444
of dealing with external danger.

01:18:55.383 --> 01:18:58.618
The barrier's still active.

01:18:58.686 --> 01:18:59.819
All right,

01:18:59.887 --> 01:19:00.954
the primary function
of the Warehouse

01:19:01.022 --> 01:19:02.789
is to protect
the world's artifacts,

01:19:02.857 --> 01:19:05.458
but the barrier, now, its
mandate has shifted--

01:19:05.525 --> 01:19:07.326
To containing the blast
and protecting the world

01:19:07.394 --> 01:19:08.561
from an artifact fallout and--

01:19:08.629 --> 01:19:09.929
If there is a big, ugly
explosion,

01:19:09.996 --> 01:19:12.731
and unfortunately,
if there are agents inside,

01:19:12.799 --> 01:19:14.567
that's just collateral damage.

01:19:14.634 --> 01:19:17.036
There's less than two minutes
left on the detonator.

01:19:17.103 --> 01:19:19.005
All right.

01:19:20.774 --> 01:19:23.777
Let me at that thing.

01:19:23.844 --> 01:19:26.547
I'm not finding anything yet.

01:19:26.615 --> 01:19:27.882
Keep looking.

01:19:27.949 --> 01:19:28.782
Something's gotta
neutralize that bomb.

01:19:28.850 --> 01:19:30.217
Something.

01:19:30.285 --> 01:19:31.652
Can't find anything
on the databases, either.

01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:33.554
Okay, so why can't we just go
to the Warehouse,

01:19:33.622 --> 01:19:34.789
and find a way
to break them out?

01:19:34.857 --> 01:19:36.691
Even if we cannot
stop the explosion--

01:19:36.759 --> 01:19:37.792
We can't get
through the barrier.

01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:39.327
Besides, there isn't time.

01:19:39.394 --> 01:19:41.028
Can I maybe hack my way in

01:19:41.096 --> 01:19:42.730
and deactivate
the barrier that way?

01:19:42.798 --> 01:19:44.899
The power isn't derived
from the main system.

01:19:44.967 --> 01:19:46.467
It's derived
from the Remati Shackle.

01:19:49.905 --> 01:19:52.273
Claudia.

01:19:52.341 --> 01:19:56.711
You're going to have to give me
back that metronome, please.

01:20:00.383 --> 01:20:02.550
Now, please.

01:20:02.618 --> 01:20:05.353
No.

01:20:05.421 --> 01:20:06.955
You know
we can't use artifacts.

01:20:07.023 --> 01:20:10.125
What I know is
I'm tired of arbitrary rules.

01:20:12.328 --> 01:20:14.163
The metronome is for Steve.

01:20:14.230 --> 01:20:16.098
I'm bringing him back.

01:20:21.538 --> 01:20:22.805
Nope.

01:20:22.872 --> 01:20:24.206
Takes a licking
and keeps on

01:20:24.274 --> 01:20:25.440
trying to kill us.

01:20:25.508 --> 01:20:26.808
Okay, the portal's closed.

01:20:26.876 --> 01:20:28.176
There's--there's
no back door.

01:20:28.244 --> 01:20:30.078
No, no back door outside
the barrier, anyway.

01:20:30.146 --> 01:20:31.246
Come on, Myka.

01:20:31.314 --> 01:20:32.180
We've gotten
out of worse than this.

01:20:32.248 --> 01:20:33.682
No, we have--we have.

01:20:33.749 --> 01:20:35.284
There's a solution,
and we can find it.

01:20:35.352 --> 01:20:36.786
All we have to do
is keep a cool head.

01:20:36.853 --> 01:20:39.522
We'll find it in...

01:20:39.590 --> 01:20:41.424
56 seconds.

01:20:50.101 --> 01:20:53.403
He did say
that we'd go out together.

01:20:53.471 --> 01:20:55.072
I always figured we would.

01:20:55.139 --> 01:20:57.774
Not me. I was planning on
outliving both of you lunatics.

01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:05.583
And here we go.

01:21:05.651 --> 01:21:06.951
Hey.

01:21:07.019 --> 01:21:09.353
Helena?

01:21:09.421 --> 01:21:11.756
What are you doing?

01:21:12.825 --> 01:21:15.126
She's trapped us.

01:21:15.194 --> 01:21:16.927
Helena, what is this?

01:21:16.995 --> 01:21:18.195
Sorry.

01:21:21.967 --> 01:21:25.937
It was the only way I could
think to save you.

01:21:26.005 --> 01:21:27.605
What have you done?

01:21:27.673 --> 01:21:29.540
There was no other way.

01:21:29.608 --> 01:21:32.643
An anomaly
in the system allowed me

01:21:32.710 --> 01:21:34.778
to re-route a portion
of the outer barrier

01:21:34.846 --> 01:21:37.313
to that spot on the floor.

01:21:37.381 --> 01:21:40.450
I just hope it lasts.

01:21:40.517 --> 01:21:42.485
You've protected us
from the blast.

01:21:42.553 --> 01:21:44.053
You should be safe now.

01:21:44.121 --> 01:21:46.889
But you're--

01:21:46.957 --> 01:21:48.557
you're out there.

01:21:48.625 --> 01:21:51.794
It had to be initiated
from outside the barrier.

01:21:51.861 --> 01:21:53.229
No, listen.

01:21:53.296 --> 01:21:54.463
You gotta let us help you.

01:21:54.531 --> 01:21:56.065
It doesn't
have to be this way.

01:22:01.772 --> 01:22:03.506
Yes.

01:22:10.547 --> 01:22:13.449
I smell apples.

01:23:23.221 --> 01:23:27.356
Claudia, the Warehouse--

01:23:27.424 --> 01:23:29.959
Mrs. Frederic!

01:24:02.524 --> 01:24:03.624
That was his plan.

01:24:03.692 --> 01:24:08.895
To destroy the entire Warehouse.

01:24:08.963 --> 01:24:12.733
We lost, Artie.

01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:17.337
We lost.

01:24:17.405 --> 01:24:20.892
Not yet.
