00:12.160 --> 00:16.400
So, Pat, before we show you to your cell,

00:16.480 --> 00:18.680
we should probably settle on a nickname.

00:18.760 --> 00:20.520
Very important in here.

00:20.600 --> 00:22.480
We do have a lot of Pats already.

00:22.560 --> 00:27.480
We've got a Pat Pat,
a Fat Pat, a Black Pat and a White Pat.

00:27.560 --> 00:30.640
So, off the top of my head,

00:30.720 --> 00:35.760
you could opt for
Fat Black Pat or Black Fat Pat.

00:36.880 --> 00:38.040
What you feeling most?

00:38.640 --> 00:41.600
You might wanna think about it
the way people choose a name for a pet.

00:41.680 --> 00:44.160
You know, what's it gonna sound like
when you call it across the park?

00:44.240 --> 00:46.520
Or, in your case, the canteen.

00:46.600 --> 00:48.880
So, "Fat Black Pat!"

00:48.960 --> 00:51.000
Or, "Black Fat Pat!"

00:52.400 --> 00:53.840
I mean, I'm leaning towards--

00:53.920 --> 00:55.040
Patricia.

00:55.120 --> 00:56.120
Interesting.

00:57.760 --> 01:03.280
Pa-tri-cia.

01:12.200 --> 01:14.160
Date's come through for my TED Talk.

01:14.800 --> 01:17.520
"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings:

01:17.600 --> 01:20.560
How Women in Prison Thrive
Through Music and Song."

01:24.440 --> 01:29.280
<i>That is my idea and apparently</i>
<i>it is an idea worth spreading.</i>

01:29.360 --> 01:32.240
And on July 22nd,

01:32.320 --> 01:36.760
I shall be spreading it liberally
all over the Birmingham Exhibition Centre.

01:36.840 --> 01:37.960
Exciting.

01:39.160 --> 01:41.040
I've gotta cut it down a little bit.

01:41.120 --> 01:43.680
It's currently running
at just over an hour and a half.

01:43.760 --> 01:47.600
My allotted time is 25 minutes,
which is a shame,

01:47.680 --> 01:49.920
but them the rules.

01:50.720 --> 01:53.600
Laura, can I just say, you're amazing.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.520
The way your mind works.

01:55.600 --> 01:59.400
"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,"
it works on so many different levels.

01:59.480 --> 02:03.880
"Birds" also means women,
"caged birds," women in prison,

02:03.960 --> 02:07.200
and, of course, "sings" as in sings.

02:07.280 --> 02:08.720
I could cry at your brilliance.

02:08.800 --> 02:10.000
Why can't you be supportive?

02:10.080 --> 02:12.000
-I am. I'm your number two.
-Mmm.

02:12.080 --> 02:15.720
Yeah, and as much as I hate
the idea of having a number two,

02:15.800 --> 02:19.600
I'd prefer it was a pleasant experience
rather than an uphill struggle.

02:19.680 --> 02:21.720
No one wants a number two
that's been an uphill struggle.

02:21.800 --> 02:23.360
-Exactly.
-I'm sorry.

02:23.440 --> 02:26.680
You're right.
You deserve a decent number two.

02:26.760 --> 02:27.760
Thank you.

02:27.840 --> 02:29.600
It's the last time
I'm getting you one of these.

02:29.680 --> 02:31.240
-Unless you want me to puke in it.
-What?

02:31.320 --> 02:32.960
I can't stand the smell of coffee no more.

02:33.040 --> 02:34.560
Oh. All right.
Well, I'll drink it really quickly.

02:35.360 --> 02:36.360
No, it's too hot.

02:36.440 --> 02:38.600
She'll drink it really quickly
when it cools down.

02:38.680 --> 02:41.560
-My God. You two are as bad as each other.
-He's worse than I am.

02:48.880 --> 02:50.080
Ah!

02:50.160 --> 02:51.880
Didn't fucking know I was there, did you?

02:51.960 --> 02:54.880
Did you know I was there?
'Cause I crawled under there.

02:54.960 --> 02:56.280
I was crawling on me knees.

02:56.360 --> 02:57.960
Did you get that on your camera?

02:58.040 --> 03:00.400
I got a-- I got a camera on my phone.

03:00.480 --> 03:03.280
I got a camera on my phone, but they
take it off youse when you come in.

03:03.360 --> 03:06.080
Like, did they take-- Do you got--
Have you got a mobile phone?

03:06.160 --> 03:07.680
Did they take it off youse?

03:07.760 --> 03:10.160
They take it off you when you come in.
Because if they've not,

03:10.240 --> 03:13.360
and you've got your mobile phone on you,
you'd get it robbed in here.

03:13.440 --> 03:15.640
Have you got your mobile phone on you?
'Cause I'd rob you.

03:15.720 --> 03:17.560
If I knew where your phone is,
I'd rob you.

03:17.640 --> 03:18.760
Know what I'm saying?

03:18.840 --> 03:20.240
'Cause you know why?

03:20.320 --> 03:21.560
'Cause we're all thieves.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.360
You fucking sucker.

03:25.960 --> 03:28.760
I'm only fucking joking.
I'll give it back to youse 'cause you're--

03:28.840 --> 03:31.280
I'm just saying, you're fucking--
You know, come on.

03:38.200 --> 03:39.840
I need to get out of this place.

03:39.920 --> 03:42.640
If I don't, there is a real chance
I could die in here.

03:42.720 --> 03:45.720
I strive to look for the good in people.

03:45.800 --> 03:47.320
I honestly do.

03:47.400 --> 03:48.920
But it is getting harder.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.520
Oh, Ange, you poor thing!

03:50.600 --> 03:52.320
I don't know what to say, what a mess.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.520
It can be hard in here at times.

03:56.840 --> 03:59.880
I mean, just when I thought
I'd found a way around prison life,

03:59.960 --> 04:02.600
I get my face smashed into a wall
for nothing.

04:02.680 --> 04:05.400
Never said anything. I didn't do anything.

04:05.480 --> 04:07.160
We all didn't do anything, love.

04:15.480 --> 04:18.960
I have it on good authority
Anastasia misunderstood the situation.

04:19.040 --> 04:21.079
I'm here to apologize. Sorry.

04:21.839 --> 04:24.480
First rule of Fight Club:
Don't talk about Fight Club.

04:24.560 --> 04:25.800
Second rule of Fight Club:

04:25.880 --> 04:27.680
If you smash someone's head
against the wall,

04:27.760 --> 04:29.360
and it's not their fault, say sorry.

04:29.440 --> 04:30.600
Third rule of Fight Club:

04:30.680 --> 04:31.920
Bring biscuits.

04:35.160 --> 04:36.640
Are we good?

04:54.680 --> 04:56.760
What's good today then?
Any recommendations?

04:56.840 --> 04:57.960
I brought my own.

04:58.040 --> 05:01.880
Smart choice from a smart lady.

05:01.960 --> 05:03.080
What's the filling du jour?

05:03.160 --> 05:04.280
Cheese.

05:04.360 --> 05:06.240
Spectaculoso!

05:09.120 --> 05:10.120
Right.

05:11.520 --> 05:13.600
I ain't got time
to gab with you all day, missus.

05:13.680 --> 05:14.680
Okay.

05:17.360 --> 05:18.400
Catch you later.

05:20.280 --> 05:21.280
Okay.

05:25.760 --> 05:27.080
She don't like you, mate.

05:29.200 --> 05:30.480
She don't like you.

05:32.200 --> 05:34.360
-You joker.
-Yeah.

05:35.720 --> 05:36.720
Yeah.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.080
Yeah.

05:40.920 --> 05:42.400
â™ª <i>Ba-ba-da-da,</i>

05:44.040 --> 05:45.520
You ladies not eating?

05:45.600 --> 05:47.800
-No appetite today.
-Yeah.

05:48.720 --> 05:49.800
That would be right.

05:51.800 --> 05:53.400
Will I take that muffin off your hands?

05:54.280 --> 05:55.840
Let's just focus on our task.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.160
Oh, yeah. What, your jigsaw thing?

05:58.240 --> 05:59.400
-Impossipuzzle.
-Impossipuzzle.

05:59.480 --> 06:00.480
Ah, yeah.

06:01.600 --> 06:05.240
Yeah, it'd be nice
to get that finished beforeâ€¦ You know.

06:05.320 --> 06:06.360
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

06:09.400 --> 06:11.360
-So are those sausages--
-Help yourself.

06:25.840 --> 06:27.800
Cal is being released.

06:28.600 --> 06:29.840
It's not good for optics

06:29.920 --> 06:32.560
that someone who was charged
with a relatively minor offense

06:32.640 --> 06:35.160
is still locked up
nearly three years later.

06:35.240 --> 06:38.240
I had to spring it on her
so she couldn't get up to her old tricks.

06:38.320 --> 06:40.680
Cal, you were only supposed
to serve three months.

06:40.760 --> 06:42.600
You've strung it out
for a long, long time.

06:42.680 --> 06:43.960
'Cause I met Sal.

06:44.040 --> 06:45.680
And I'll be honest, if I met

06:45.760 --> 06:48.880
the love of my late-onset-lesbian-life
in prison doing ten years,

06:48.960 --> 06:50.400
I'd probably do the same thing.

06:51.320 --> 06:53.240
But we've come to the end of the line.

06:53.320 --> 06:55.600
I can't turn a blind eye any longer.

06:55.680 --> 06:57.240
It won't work anymore.

06:57.320 --> 06:59.160
Intimidating behavior.

06:59.240 --> 07:00.520
Taking the guards hostage.

07:00.600 --> 07:02.800
Defecating on the parole officer's desk?

07:02.880 --> 07:04.440
I'm afraid not.

07:06.920 --> 07:09.480
-When?
-Tomorrow.

07:12.680 --> 07:13.840
I've got a new business.

07:14.440 --> 07:17.520
-What's your new business?
-I'm making lots of dough.

07:17.600 --> 07:20.360
-Got it wrong again, haven't I?
-I will miss you.

07:23.320 --> 07:24.480
I feel sick.

07:31.320 --> 07:32.680
I look really fat.

07:34.480 --> 07:35.960
I'm like a hamster.

07:36.800 --> 07:38.080
I'm gonna keep it there.

07:38.160 --> 07:40.200
How long can I keep the sausage
in me mouth?

07:40.800 --> 07:43.520
I do feel bad for those two.
It's really sad.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.320
It is. It's really sad.

07:47.320 --> 07:49.160
Things are going great for me though.

07:49.920 --> 07:51.840
Sebastian couldn't be more
in love with me.

07:51.920 --> 07:53.960
Which means there's nothing
he wouldn't do for me.

07:54.040 --> 07:56.560
Which means he put shitloads of money
into the joint account.

07:56.640 --> 07:58.520
Which I transferred over to my mammy.

07:58.600 --> 07:59.880
Which is fantastic.

08:00.800 --> 08:02.200
It came as a shock to him though.

08:02.280 --> 08:05.920
It was a shock, Rosalind, when I saw
that our bank account was empty.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
It was a shock to my eyes.

08:08.080 --> 08:09.720
A shock to my heart.

08:09.800 --> 08:10.800
It was a shock.

08:10.880 --> 08:13.280
I know, Sebastian. I know.

08:13.360 --> 08:16.720
What were you thinking?
To drain our bank account of funds?

08:17.600 --> 08:20.680
-It was a--
-Shock. And I'm sorry. I got carried away.

08:20.760 --> 08:25.040
But I found us the perfect camper van
and I just wanted to buy it for us.

08:25.120 --> 08:26.680
Surprise!

08:26.760 --> 08:28.720
Or rather, shock!

08:30.240 --> 08:32.560
For one terrible moment, it occurred to me

08:32.640 --> 08:36.120
that you had drained our bank account
of funds for your own personal use.

08:36.200 --> 08:38.280
That your love for me was a show.

08:38.360 --> 08:41.039
And that you saw me as nothing more
than a meal ticket.

08:47.559 --> 08:50.200
That'sâ€¦ silly.

08:53.240 --> 08:55.280
Silly Sebastian.

08:55.800 --> 08:58.120
It was the devil at work.

08:58.200 --> 09:01.080
Corrupting my faith, making me doubt.

09:01.160 --> 09:04.160
How could I think such a thing
of my Rosalind?

09:04.240 --> 09:09.200
My wonderful, innocent,
soon-to-look-like-this Rosalind.

09:12.560 --> 09:13.560
Oh.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.520
All right, stop.

09:37.240 --> 09:38.240
What's going on?

09:38.320 --> 09:40.080
-It's just a bit shit, innit?
-All right.

09:40.160 --> 09:42.560
What's the point of this anyway?
We ain't getting any better.

09:42.640 --> 09:46.120
-People don't even know their lines.
-Shut up. You can't even dance, you whale.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.200
-I was sidestepping, so that's a lie.
-Sidestepping?

09:48.280 --> 09:50.000
Guys, let's put this energy to good use.

09:50.080 --> 09:51.800
Everyone,
get in your places for the fight scene.

09:51.880 --> 09:53.280
That sounds like a plan.

09:53.360 --> 09:56.640
Uh, Heather, now that Big Viv's gone,
who is it that I'm stepping in to fight?

09:56.720 --> 09:58.080
Step, step.

09:58.160 --> 09:59.760
Good point, well made.

10:01.280 --> 10:02.800
For fuck's sake.

10:03.400 --> 10:05.640
<i>Can't believe I'm saying this,</i>
<i>but I'm missing Big Viv.</i>

10:05.720 --> 10:08.320
I mean, she was terrifying,
but at least she had stage presence.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.120
Don't fucking fuck with the melody, hen.

10:17.200 --> 10:21.360
But she's now stuck in solitary,
and I'm beginning to regret this.

10:25.720 --> 10:27.920
I mean, she is superb.

10:31.040 --> 10:32.440
Oh, ho!

10:33.920 --> 10:35.360
You nailed it, Cheryl.

10:35.440 --> 10:36.800
-No.

10:38.600 --> 10:40.480
We've only got a few pieces to go.

10:40.560 --> 10:41.920
I can't believe we're here.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.040
We're nearly finished!

10:44.120 --> 10:45.440
Shut up!

10:45.520 --> 10:47.480
-Go on! You've got this.

10:47.560 --> 10:49.120
Look at you guys.

10:49.200 --> 10:51.120
Oh!

10:51.200 --> 10:52.880
Let's do the final piece together.

10:52.960 --> 10:54.600
-Aw!
-Have you got it?

10:54.680 --> 10:56.160
-No.
-Pulling my leg?

10:56.240 --> 10:57.720
No, I haven't got it.

10:57.800 --> 11:00.160
Oh, come on, you pair of jokers.
Put the last piece in.

11:00.240 --> 11:02.040
No, honestly, I don't have it.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.240
Neither do I.

11:03.880 --> 11:06.640
-Oh, no!
-It'll be here somewhere.

11:07.440 --> 11:10.040
It was a brand-new jigsaw. It was sealed.

11:10.120 --> 11:13.200
Oh, Cal. Oh, someone must have taken it.

11:14.440 --> 11:15.440
Some--

11:16.880 --> 11:18.320
Where is it?

11:18.400 --> 11:21.120
-I haven't got it.
-Come on. Stop your messing.

11:21.200 --> 11:23.600
-Just give us the last piece.
-I haven't got it.

11:23.680 --> 11:26.280
Listen, these ladies
have worked their asses off,

11:26.360 --> 11:28.320
and no one's laughing
at your stupid little prank.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.960
-I haven't got it, you fucking moron.
-Oh, fuck off!

11:33.400 --> 11:35.040
-Stop it!
-Guys.

11:37.680 --> 11:39.880
Come on! Girls, come on!

11:39.960 --> 11:41.160
Stop it!

11:43.560 --> 11:48.240
Has it ever occurred to you that the rest
of the world might not be against you?

11:48.960 --> 11:51.800
Why do you have to make it so hard?

11:53.080 --> 11:57.840
We're all in here making the best of it,
supporting each other.

11:57.920 --> 12:01.440
But you've just caused nothing
but upset and negativity.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.040
Today is Cal's last day.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.920
There's no way I'm gonna let you ruin it.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
Now give us back our jigsaw piece,
you dreadful little cunt.

12:17.480 --> 12:18.960
Ooh.

12:36.640 --> 12:37.960
<i>People don't like me.</i>

12:39.000 --> 12:40.880
<i>I don't care. I'm used to it.</i>

12:41.720 --> 12:45.040
It's not like I'm missing much.
They always let you down anyway.

12:45.920 --> 12:48.640
No, I'd rather be on my own.
Prefer it that way.

12:49.440 --> 12:52.000
Be an asshole to them
before they're an asshole to you.

12:53.800 --> 12:56.160
<i>I mean, how do you</i>
<i>even make friends anyway?</i>

12:56.240 --> 12:57.640
<i>How would you do that?</i>

12:59.360 --> 13:00.400
Uh--

13:19.320 --> 13:20.720
Stay with the herd, boo.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.600
-I'm going for a piss.
-Oh.

13:23.560 --> 13:25.160
Don't mind me.

13:25.240 --> 13:26.600
-Don't mind me.
-Heather Trott!

13:26.680 --> 13:30.080
I know you got some celebrating to do.
I'm just gonna leave this here.

13:30.160 --> 13:33.240
Uh, it's not too late to join us
in the show, <i>Songs From The Inside</i> .

13:33.320 --> 13:35.720
-Whoo!
-Not as many songs as it was before.

13:35.800 --> 13:39.320
So yeah, put your name down--
someone, anyone, please.

13:39.400 --> 13:42.480
It's gonna be a laugh, innit, eh?
Eh? Eh? Maybe.

13:42.560 --> 13:43.560
Anywayâ€¦

13:44.160 --> 13:46.840
What with Cal leaving,
I can feel my panic rising.

13:46.920 --> 13:49.720
I don't think anyone realizes
the scale of what we're trying to do here,

13:49.800 --> 13:50.920
and it's all on my shoulders.

13:59.680 --> 14:02.160
Oh! Ooh! Uh, after you.

14:02.240 --> 14:05.000
What are we doing now?
We're dancing, are we?

14:05.080 --> 14:07.840
Hey, there she goes. See you later.

14:10.520 --> 14:13.520
What a fantastic group of women we are.

14:13.600 --> 14:14.760
Absolutely.

14:14.840 --> 14:16.920
We're not afraid to be heard.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.400
-No, we're not.
-We're not afraid to make mistakes,

14:19.480 --> 14:22.080
because God knows
we wouldn't be in here if we were.

14:24.080 --> 14:26.880
And we're not afraid to change.

14:27.880 --> 14:31.520
I can honestly say
I've had the time of my life in here.

14:31.600 --> 14:33.760
-Aw!
-We'll miss you, Cal.

14:33.840 --> 14:36.120
So thank you. All of you.

14:37.280 --> 14:38.400
Especially you.

14:38.480 --> 14:40.920
-Aw!
-We'll miss you, Cal.

15:18.360 --> 15:20.000
Hey.

15:24.840 --> 15:29.120
I'm sorry to leave before the show,
but do us all proud.

15:29.200 --> 15:31.400
<i>Songs From The Inside</i> .

15:31.480 --> 15:33.120
-Yeah!
-<i>Songs From The Inside</i> !

15:37.680 --> 15:40.640
All right.
Let's keep it pre-watershed, boos.

15:53.640 --> 15:57.160
-I don't want to say goodbye.
-Then don't, 'cause it's not.

15:57.240 --> 15:58.920
It's time, ladies.

16:05.720 --> 16:06.920
I've got a new business.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.040
What's your new business?

16:10.120 --> 16:11.520
I'm a baker.

16:12.600 --> 16:13.760
How's business?

16:13.840 --> 16:16.360
I'm making lots of dough.

16:18.680 --> 16:19.680
Yes!

16:29.120 --> 16:30.120
We love you!

16:30.200 --> 16:32.080
-Whoo!
-We love you!

16:41.160 --> 16:43.880
-Are you drinking coffee again?
-Oh, it is decaf.

16:43.960 --> 16:45.880
Doesn't matter. It still smells of coffee.

16:45.960 --> 16:48.560
You're like a bloodhound. It is very hot.

16:52.640 --> 16:53.640
Oh, God.

16:55.800 --> 16:57.560
All gone.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.360
Satisfied?

17:01.440 --> 17:02.760
Mmm.

17:03.360 --> 17:05.760
How is da baba?

17:05.840 --> 17:06.920
What?

17:07.000 --> 17:08.600
How's da baba?

17:09.359 --> 17:11.240
Da baba in da tum-tum?

17:11.319 --> 17:12.520
Again, what?

17:12.599 --> 17:16.440
I'm thinking "baba" means baby,
and-- correct me if I'm wrong, Laura--

17:16.520 --> 17:19.079
"baba in da tum-tum"
means "baby in the tummy."

17:19.160 --> 17:21.079
So, if my Spidey-Sense is on point,

17:21.160 --> 17:24.280
I believe the question you're being asked
is, "How is your unborn child?"

17:24.359 --> 17:26.240
-Mmm.
-She's booting me.

17:26.319 --> 17:27.440
Just like her dad.

17:28.440 --> 17:30.079
Bloody hell. She's gone mental. Feel that.

17:30.160 --> 17:31.960
Not sure that's appropriate
in the workplace.

17:32.040 --> 17:33.800
-Oh, let me have a go.
-Even less appropriate.

17:37.760 --> 17:40.320
Baba kicking da mum-mum in da tum-tum.

17:43.240 --> 17:44.720
I mean, that was weird.

17:47.640 --> 17:49.160
Oh, my God!

17:49.240 --> 17:50.440
Oh!

17:50.520 --> 17:53.440
Look at this! What?

17:53.520 --> 17:56.200
<i>The scenery's arrived from</i>
<i>another musical, which is set in New York.</i>

17:56.280 --> 17:59.400
Unlike ours, which is set in Kent.
But it was too late to change it.

17:59.480 --> 18:01.040
Come on. Chin up, Cheryl.

18:01.120 --> 18:03.280
Musicals about gang violence
work in any setting.

18:03.360 --> 18:05.240
<i>It's a notoriously adaptable genre.</i>

18:05.320 --> 18:06.680
<i>It's set in Kent, Martin.</i>

18:06.760 --> 18:10.280
Yes. And the revolving Manhattan skyline
will only be a bonus.

18:10.360 --> 18:13.320
I don't want to spook anyone,
but I think this could all go to shit.

18:13.400 --> 18:15.360
-We've got fire hydrants.
-Please stop.

18:15.440 --> 18:17.360
-Look at that.
-This is so cool!

18:17.440 --> 18:19.880
-Oh, my God. Look at all this stuff.
-This is amazing.

18:19.960 --> 18:21.200
-Umbrellas.
-Oh, my goodness.

18:21.280 --> 18:22.240
I found my knife.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.480
-Look at that.
-Oh! Bloody hell!

18:25.560 --> 18:28.520
Look at that. Look at that. Look at that.
That doesn't even hurt.

18:28.600 --> 18:31.280
-Look. That didn't hurt me.
-Oh, you're having that, are you?

18:33.040 --> 18:36.600
I'll wear the hat.
I'm wearing a hat. I'll wear that.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.360
Umbrella. Is it raining outside?

18:38.440 --> 18:40.520
Welcome to the Big Apple, ladies.

18:40.600 --> 18:42.120
Windows are practical. Oh!

18:42.200 --> 18:44.280
-All right. All right.

18:44.360 --> 18:47.240
Keep it down, you lot, or I'll turn
one of them fire hydrants on you.

18:47.320 --> 18:49.480
Right, ladies.
The scenery is pretty impressive.

18:49.560 --> 18:51.960
It makes no sense, but at least
it'll be something to look at.

18:52.040 --> 18:53.480
Anastasia's jumped right in.

18:53.560 --> 18:55.480
-Fuck off.

18:55.560 --> 18:58.240
Can she dance? Can she sing?
Doesn't matter. We're on in four days.

18:58.320 --> 19:00.240
Only joking. It's gonna be great.

19:00.320 --> 19:03.680
Cal's gone too, which leaves Sal's
vocal weakness very much exposed.

19:03.760 --> 19:08.480
But hey, we've got fire hydrants!
Yeah. So it's gonna be a good show.

19:08.560 --> 19:09.600
And Ange, yeah?

19:09.680 --> 19:12.840
She's now doing props, which I doubt will
make a difference one way or another.

19:12.920 --> 19:15.440
Anyway, let's start with the intro.
Five, six, seven, eight.

19:15.520 --> 19:17.720
Sorry. Could somebody
actually please give me a hand?

19:17.800 --> 19:20.160
-Come down, will you! Jump!

19:22.160 --> 19:26.440
I have it on good authority that the case
against me is collapsing.

19:26.520 --> 19:28.040
I don't want to speak too soon,

19:28.120 --> 19:30.360
but it feels like
my prayers have been answered.

19:30.440 --> 19:32.960
And Big Viv apologized.

19:33.040 --> 19:34.400
It's a good day.

19:35.000 --> 19:40.200
It's like I always say, never
underestimate how good people can beâ€¦

19:42.720 --> 19:43.720
mostly.

19:48.040 --> 19:49.720
-I wasn't asleep!

19:49.800 --> 19:50.800
Hello.

20:06.800 --> 20:10.720
I mean, it's a good one.
It's good. I'm looking forward to it.

20:10.800 --> 20:12.880
Actually, it's my day off.
I won't be there.

20:14.160 --> 20:16.280
I ain't coming in.
Don't need it that much.

20:16.360 --> 20:18.680
I mean, how good is it gonna be?

20:18.760 --> 20:19.800
Not that good.

20:41.280 --> 20:43.160
Yeah. I thought, "Why not join in?"

20:43.240 --> 20:44.920
So, I did.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.720
And I'm enjoying it. And I'm good at it.

20:48.800 --> 20:51.680
I mean, some of the girls took me
through the routines at lunchtime,

20:51.760 --> 20:55.160
<i>and they didn't have to do that,</i>
<i>so they obviously don't hate me.</i>

20:56.800 --> 20:59.160
I don't-- What do you
want me to say? It's fun.

20:59.240 --> 21:00.800
Okay?

21:42.280 --> 21:44.320
Sort of like that? I don't know.

21:44.400 --> 21:46.600
-Whoa!
-Yeah!

21:46.680 --> 21:50.280
Someone's gonna wind up
at the Oscars.

21:52.520 --> 21:55.080
Tiramisu has got coffee in it, hasn't it?

21:55.160 --> 21:57.080
It most certainly has.

21:57.160 --> 21:59.520
Although, interestingly,
I had it this one time--

21:59.600 --> 22:00.600
Nope.

22:00.680 --> 22:02.480
Okay. Catch you later.

22:03.240 --> 22:04.440
No, you hang up.

22:05.320 --> 22:06.760
No, you hang up.

22:07.560 --> 22:08.720
No, you hang up.

22:10.240 --> 22:11.280
I'll hang up.

22:20.640 --> 22:23.360
-Do you want some company?
-I'm all right. Thank you, love.

22:23.440 --> 22:26.560
Well, I'll just be here
if you change your mind, like.

22:30.400 --> 22:31.760
Try to eat a little something.

22:36.000 --> 22:40.160
Where the fuck is the tiramisu?

22:42.240 --> 22:44.040
-Love tiramisu.
-Love tiramisu.

22:44.120 --> 22:45.600
-Go on. You go.
-Go on. You go.

22:45.680 --> 22:47.160
-Fuck off.
-Fuck off.

23:20.800 --> 23:24.000
The thing about Laura is
she sort of creeps up on you.

23:24.080 --> 23:26.400
On first impressions, she's a cringe fest.

23:26.480 --> 23:30.560
Like this irritating, withering old ball
of embarrassment.

23:30.640 --> 23:34.120
But she's got this other side to her
which you can't help but like.

23:34.200 --> 23:38.800
Yeah, you know what? Laura's all right.
I mean, this musical, it ain't nothing.

23:38.880 --> 23:40.520
It means a lot to people.

23:40.600 --> 23:42.000
Means a lot to me.

23:42.080 --> 23:44.080
Never had a chance like this before.

23:44.160 --> 23:45.520
I think it's gonna be amazing.

23:45.600 --> 23:48.560
I think we're all gonna be amazing,
and that's down to her.

23:48.640 --> 23:50.920
Plus, that desk job has been a lifesaver,

23:51.000 --> 23:53.440
because my ankles did get really puffy.

24:26.480 --> 24:32.400
s-
