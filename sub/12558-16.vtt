13:19.841 --> 13:22.799
AND THE WIND MOVED THEM.

13:22.844 --> 13:24.630
AND I REMEMBER...

13:24.679 --> 13:27.671
NIGHT SKIES.

13:27.765 --> 13:29.381
NIGHT SKIES...

13:29.475 --> 13:32.388
<i>LIKE ENDLESS
BLACK VELVET.</i>

13:32.478 --> 13:35.015
<i>WITH STARS...</i>

13:35.106 --> 13:37.063
<i>SOMETIMES A MOON...</i>

13:37.150 --> 13:40.313
HUNG AS IF
SUSPENDED BY WIRES...

13:40.361 --> 13:41.977
LIT FROM INSIDE.

13:42.071 --> 13:44.984
WHAT'S NIGHT,
CAPTAIN?

13:45.074 --> 13:46.405
NIGHT...

13:46.492 --> 13:48.654
NIGHT WAS A
QUIET TIME, JO-JO,

13:48.745 --> 13:51.032
WHEN THE EARTH
WENT TO SLEEP.

13:51.122 --> 13:54.706
KIND OF LIKE A COVER THAT
IT PULLED OVER ITSELF.

13:54.792 --> 13:58.001
NOT LIKE HERE WHERE
WE HAVE THE TWO SUNS

13:58.087 --> 14:00.340
ALWAYS SHINING,
ALWAYS BURNING.

14:00.381 --> 14:02.372
IT WAS DARKNESS, JO-JO.

14:02.467 --> 14:05.710
<i>DARKNESS THAT
FELT LIKE...</i>

14:05.803 --> 14:07.419
<i>[sighs]</i>

14:07.513 --> 14:09.379
<i>...LIKE A COOL HAND</i>

14:09.474 --> 14:13.342
JUST BRUSHED
PAST TIRED EYES.

14:13.436 --> 14:16.519
AND THERE WAS SNOW
ON THE WINTER NIGHTS--

14:16.606 --> 14:18.517
GOSSAMER STUFF THAT--

14:18.608 --> 14:20.440
FLOATED DOWN

14:20.526 --> 14:22.437
<i>AND COVERED THE EARTH,</i>

14:22.528 --> 14:25.691
<i>MADE IT ALL
WHITE, COOL.</i>

14:25.782 --> 14:27.614
AND IN THE MORNINGS,

14:27.700 --> 14:31.068
WE COULD GO OUT
AND BUILD A SNOWMAN.

14:31.162 --> 14:34.371
SEE OUR BREATH IN THE AIR.

14:34.457 --> 14:37.199
AND IT WAS GOOD THEN.

14:37.293 --> 14:38.704
IT WAS RIGHT.

14:38.795 --> 14:41.207
CAPTAIN, WHY DID
YOU LEAVE THERE?

14:41.255 --> 14:43.963
WELL, WE THOUGHT
WE COULD FIND

14:44.050 --> 14:46.382
ANOTHER PLACE
LIKE EARTH

14:46.469 --> 14:48.710
BUT WITH DIFFERENT
BEAUTIES, JO-JO.

14:48.805 --> 14:52.423
<i>AND WE FOUND
THIS PLACE.</i>

14:52.517 --> 14:54.633
<i>WE THOUGHT WE
COULD ESCAPE WAR.</i>

14:54.727 --> 14:57.469
WE THOUGHT WE COULD...

14:57.563 --> 15:00.225
WELL, WE THOUGHT
THAT WE COULD BUILD

15:00.316 --> 15:01.932
AN EVEN BETTER PLACE.

15:02.026 --> 15:04.484
<i>AND IT TOOK US
3O YEARS TO FIND OUT</i>

15:04.570 --> 15:07.653
<i>THAT WE'D LEFT OUR HOME
A BILLION MILES AWAY</i>

15:07.740 --> 15:11.278
TO BE ONLY VISITORS
HERE, TRANSIENTS...

15:11.369 --> 15:15.158
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PUT DOWN
ROOTS IN THIS GROUND.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.159
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.491
SO WE SPENT 3O YEARS

15:19.585 --> 15:23.954
WATCHING A CLOCK
AND A CALENDAR.

15:24.048 --> 15:25.755
<i>[faint whirring]</i>

15:28.511 --> 15:32.175
<i>[whirring continues]</i>

15:32.265 --> 15:36.509
AND WAITING.

15:36.602 --> 15:41.563
BUT WE'RE NOT GOING
TO WAIT ANY LONGER, JO-JO.

15:41.607 --> 15:43.939
WE CAN'T WAIT ANOTHER...

15:44.026 --> 15:45.937
DAY...

15:46.028 --> 15:49.942
NOT ANOTHER HOUR.

15:50.032 --> 15:53.366
WE'RE GOING BACK
TO THE EARTH...

15:53.453 --> 15:57.947
RIGHT NOW.

15:58.040 --> 16:04.662
<i>[loud whirring]</i>

16:04.755 --> 16:07.713
<i>[low rumbling]</i>

16:07.800 --> 16:10.667
AL BAINES?

16:10.761 --> 16:13.890
AL BAINES!

16:13.973 --> 16:15.509
AL!

16:15.600 --> 16:17.307
YOU HEAR
THAT NOISE?

16:17.351 --> 16:20.639
ALL OF YOU,
DO YOU HEAR THAT?

16:20.730 --> 16:23.643
THAT'S NOT A METEOR.

16:23.733 --> 16:26.725
THAT'S NOT
WISHFUL THINKING.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.355
THAT'S NOT...

16:28.446 --> 16:31.734
MAKE-BELIEVE
OR A PHANTOM.

16:31.824 --> 16:36.068
THOSE ARE ROCKETS.

16:36.162 --> 16:38.324
THAT'S THE SHIP.

16:38.372 --> 16:41.080
[crowd talking and exclaiming]

16:41.167 --> 16:43.078
THE SHIP IS HERE.

16:43.169 --> 16:45.331
[loud humming]

17:13.574 --> 17:14.951
[metal grinding]

17:38.099 --> 17:39.635
MR. BENTEEN?

17:39.725 --> 17:42.638
I'M BENTEEN.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.639
COLONEL SLOANE,
COMMANDING THE <i>GALAXY</i> V/.

17:44.730 --> 17:48.223
OUR ORDERS ARE TO TRANSPORT
YOU ALL BACK TO EARTH.

17:48.317 --> 17:50.900
[shouting and yelling]

17:57.785 --> 18:02.746
(female voice)
OH, WELCOME, SIR!

18:02.832 --> 18:04.573
(Benteen)
COLONEL...

18:04.667 --> 18:07.409
<i>COLONEL, COLONEL, WHAT
TOOK YOU SO LONG'?</i>

18:07.461 --> 18:10.419
VVELL, VVE'\/E BEEN
TRAVELING FOR SIX MONTHS...

18:10.464 --> 18:11.841
OH, A HUNDRED
TIMES MORE.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.665
WE'VE BEEN
WAITING 3O YEARS.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.670
WE GOT YOUR MESSAGE
TWO MONTHS AGO

18:15.761 --> 18:17.752
THEN WE LISTENED
AND LISTENED...

18:17.847 --> 18:18.757
WE DID IT.

18:18.848 --> 18:19.929
WE DID IT.

18:20.016 --> 18:21.302
...THEN NOTHING MORE.

18:21.392 --> 18:22.803
WE TRIED TO
TRANSMIT TO YOU,

18:22.893 --> 18:24.600
BUT WE SIMPLY
COULDN'T GET THROUGH.

18:24.645 --> 18:26.761
BUT WHEN WE HEARD
YOUR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT,

18:26.814 --> 18:29.021
WE KNEW YOU'D RECEIVED
THE INITIAL MESSAGE.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.770
DOES IT ALL LOOK LIKE THIS?
THE VVHOLE PLACE?

18:31.861 --> 18:33.443
YES, IT ALL
LOOKS LIKE THIS.

18:33.487 --> 18:35.228
CRAGGY MOUNTAINS,

18:35.323 --> 18:37.439
<i>SALT FLATS, TWO SUNS,
PERPETUALLY SHINING.</i>

18:37.533 --> 18:39.649
YES, IT ALL
LOOKS LIKE THIS.

18:39.744 --> 18:40.700
3O YEARS.

18:40.786 --> 18:42.197
YES, 3O YEARS.

18:42.288 --> 18:44.529
SOME HERE HAVE NEVER
SEEN EARTH.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.787
SOME OLDER PEOPLE DON'T
REMEMBER VVHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

18:47.835 --> 18:51.453
THEY'LL SEE IT NOVV. OUR ORDERS ARE TO
GET YOU ON BOARD AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

18:51.505 --> 18:53.997
WE FIGURED YOU SHOULD BE
READY TO LEAVE THURSDAY.

18:54.091 --> 18:56.503
THAT'D GIVE YOU THREE
DAYS TO ARRANGE THINGS.

18:56.594 --> 18:59.803
UNFORTUNATELY, YOUR PEOPLE VVILL ONLY
BE ABLE TO TAKE VVHAT THEY CAN CARRY.

18:59.889 --> 19:01.471
THERE ARE
OVER 150, RIGHT?

19:01.557 --> 19:03.389
187-- MEN, WOMEN
AND CHILDREN.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.888
BUT THEY'LL MAKE THIS TRIP
STANDING ON THEIR HEADS.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.140
I DON'T THINK THAT'LL
BE NECESSARY.

19:08.189 --> 19:11.648
IT'LL BE A LITTLE CROVVDED,
BUT VVE'LL FIT YOU ALL IN.

19:11.692 --> 19:13.023
I CAN SEE YOU'RE
VERY MUCH USED

19:13.110 --> 19:14.145
TO A GREAT DEAL
OF SPACE, SIR.

19:14.236 --> 19:15.567
SPACE... AND HEAT!

19:15.655 --> 19:17.646
YES, I CAN
BELIEVE IT.

19:17.698 --> 19:19.564
JO-JO WOULD LIKE
TO MEET THE COLONEL.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.741
COLONEL SLOANE,
THIS IS JO-JO.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.329
WELL, HOW DO YOU DO?

19:23.371 --> 19:25.157
CAN I GIVE YOU
A KISS, CAPTAIN?

19:25.206 --> 19:26.913
YOU SURE CAN.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.990
CAN JO-JO INSPECT
THE SHIP, COLONEL?

19:29.085 --> 19:30.951
CERTAINLY, TAKE HIM
RIGHT UP THERE.

19:31.045 --> 19:32.410
THE EARTH!

19:32.505 --> 19:34.416
COLONEL, HAS
THE EARTH CHANGED?

19:34.507 --> 19:35.747
NO, NOT TOO MUCH.

19:35.841 --> 19:37.172
IS IT STILL GREEN?

19:37.259 --> 19:38.590
IT'S STILL GREEN.

19:38.678 --> 19:39.964
AND THE CITIES?

19:40.054 --> 19:41.385
AND THE CITIES
STILL STAND.

19:41.472 --> 19:43.304
AND WAR?

19:43.391 --> 19:45.348
ONE POPS UP HERE,
ANOTHER DIES OUT THERE,

19:45.434 --> 19:47.516
BUT THROUGH A MIRACLE
AND THE GRACE OF GOD

19:47.561 --> 19:49.347
WE NEVER HAD
THE HYDROGEN WAR.

19:49.397 --> 19:50.353
CAPTAIN BENTEEN.

19:50.439 --> 19:51.941
GEORGE, GEORGE.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.890
COLONEL SLOANE,
THIS IS GEORGE MORRIS.

19:53.984 --> 19:54.849
HOW DO YOU DO?

19:54.902 --> 19:56.563
PLEASURE.

19:56.654 --> 19:58.190
NO, I THINK
YOU'LL FIND IT

19:58.239 --> 20:00.697
VERY MUCH AS YOU
LEFT IT, MR. BENTEEN.

20:00.783 --> 20:02.444
CAPTAIN BENTEEN.

20:02.535 --> 20:03.775
CAPTAIN BENTEEN.

20:03.869 --> 20:05.576
THAT'S WHAT
PEOPLE CALL ME.

20:05.663 --> 20:08.075
THIS PLACE VVAS MY
RESPONSIBILITY FOR 3O YEARS.

20:08.165 --> 20:09.701
YOU'VE DONE
QUITE A JOB.

20:09.792 --> 20:11.203
BUT YOU CAN
REST EASY NOW.

20:11.252 --> 20:13.414
WE'LL HANDLE
THE RESPONSIBILITY.

20:13.504 --> 20:15.620
WELL, I'VE BECOME
USED TO THE FUNCTIONS.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.626
YOUR QUARTERS,
THEY'RE UNDERGROUND.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.082
AS I WAS SAYING--

20:19.176 --> 20:20.758
IS IT COOLER THERE,
MR. BENTEEN?

20:20.845 --> 20:23.257
I... VVHERE? I DIDN'T
HEAR VVHAT YOU SAID.

20:23.347 --> 20:25.725
YOUR UNDERGROUND ROOMS,
ARE THEY COOLER?

20:25.808 --> 20:27.219
<i>THEY'RE REFRIGERATED.</i>

20:27.309 --> 20:28.811
<i>BUT IT'S
CAPTAIN BENTEEN.</i>

20:28.894 --> 20:31.272
CAPTAIN BENTEEN'S
KEPT US ALIVE HERE.

20:31.355 --> 20:33.346
I BELIEVE IT,
CAPTAIN BENTEEN.

20:33.441 --> 20:35.398
CAN I SHOW YOU
THE SHIP, GENTLEMEN?

20:35.484 --> 20:37.350
YES, YES.

20:47.663 --> 20:48.994
(Benteen)
AL...

20:49.081 --> 20:52.244
AL BAINES.

20:52.293 --> 20:53.533
WHERE'S YOUR SLING?

20:53.627 --> 20:55.209
IT'S A MAGNESIUM BAND.

20:55.296 --> 20:57.287
COLONEL SLOANE SAYS
MY ARM WILL BE PERFECT

20:57.381 --> 21:00.169
BY THE END OF THE WEEK.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.875
LOOK AT JULIE'S CHEEK.

21:01.969 --> 21:04.256
ISN'T IT
INCREDIBLE, CAPTAIN?

21:04.346 --> 21:06.963
LOOK, COLONEL SLOANE
GAVE IT TO ME.

21:07.057 --> 21:08.468
<i>IT'S A
MEDICINAL BANDAGE.</i>

21:08.559 --> 21:10.345
<i>YOU WEAR IT
FOR 24 HOURS...</i>

21:10.436 --> 21:12.973
<i>IT ACCELERATES THE
GROWTH OF NEW SKIN.</i>

21:13.063 --> 21:16.897
YOU CAN HARDLY
SEE THE BRUISE.

21:16.984 --> 21:18.486
IT REALLY
IS INCREDIBLE.

21:18.569 --> 21:20.856
LOOKS LIKE I'VE
LOST MY PRACTICE.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.107
AL, DO ME A FAVOR.

21:22.198 --> 21:23.688
PUT THAT
IN A SLING.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.365
I'VE TREATED HUNDREDS
OF BROKEN ARMS

21:25.451 --> 21:27.158
AND THE ONLY
WAY TO CURE THEM--

21:27.244 --> 21:28.575
IS TO KEEP
THEM IMMOBILE.

21:41.509 --> 21:44.217
AS YOU ALL KNOVV, IN
LESS THAN 36 HOURS,

21:44.303 --> 21:46.135
WE'LL BE DEPARTING.

21:46.222 --> 21:49.010
WEIGHT ALLOWANCE HAS BEEN
SET AT 14 POUNDS PER PERSON.

21:49.099 --> 21:51.761
WHEN WE LEAVE HERE, WE'LL
BEGIN A PROCESS OF NOTATION

21:51.852 --> 21:54.310
TO ESTABLISH WHAT YOUR
PERSONAL BELONGINGS WILL BE

21:54.396 --> 21:57.809
AND WHAT THEY WILL--

21:57.858 --> 21:59.360
COLONEL SLOANE.

21:59.443 --> 22:01.480
HOPE I'M NOT
INTRUDING, CAPTAIN.

22:01.529 --> 22:03.065
OF COURSE NOT.

22:03.155 --> 22:04.486
IWAS GIVING
WEIGHT REQUIREMENTS.

22:04.573 --> 22:06.314
WE'LL HANDLE
THAT TOMORROW.

22:06.367 --> 22:08.233
WHEN I HEARD
YOU WERE MEETING,

22:08.327 --> 22:10.364
I BROUGHT ENGLE
AND RAFFERTY.

22:10.454 --> 22:13.788
YOU'VE ALL BEEN ASKING SO
MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT EARTH

22:13.874 --> 22:16.081
ITHOUGHT WE'D
ANSWER A FEW MORE.

22:16.168 --> 22:19.377
THE PURPOSE OF THIS MEETING IS TO
DEAL VVITH DEPARTURE PROBLEMS.

22:19.463 --> 22:21.875
COLONEL, MY FOLKS
WERE FROM SAN DIEGO.

22:21.966 --> 22:23.331
WHAT'S CALIFORNIA LIKE?

22:23.425 --> 22:25.257
SUNNY AND WARM,
MOST OF THE TIME.

22:25.344 --> 22:28.678
LOS ANGELES IS THE BIGGEST
CITY IN THE VVORLD NOVV.

22:28.764 --> 22:31.927
I FEEL THAT THESE QUESTIONS
CAN BEST BE ANSVVERED

22:32.017 --> 22:33.428
AT A LATER TIME.

22:33.519 --> 22:34.759
DO THEY STILL HAVE
PUBLIC SCHOOLS?

22:34.854 --> 22:36.686
OH, YES.

22:36.772 --> 22:39.104
<i>AND THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH
THE SAME AS THEY WERE.</i>

22:39.191 --> 22:41.683
<i>EXCEPT THEY'RE LARGER,
BETTER-EQUIPPED,</i>

22:41.777 --> 22:43.734
<i>MORE ADEQUATELY STAFFED.</i>

22:43.821 --> 22:46.404
<i>THERE'S A WHOLE NEW SYSTEM
OF VISUAL AIDS NOW.</i>

22:46.490 --> 22:48.151
<i>MANY CLASSES
ARE TELEVISED.</i>

22:48.242 --> 22:50.574
<i>IF A STUDENT IS
LEARNING ABOUT, OH...</i>

22:50.661 --> 22:52.447
<i>WE'LL SAY THE
GRAND CANYON,</i>

22:52.538 --> 22:55.951
THEY DO AN ACTUAL PROGRAM
RIGHT THERE ON THE SCENE

22:56.041 --> 23:00.376
THAT'S FED INTO THE CLASSROOM
ON A NEVV TAPE DEVICE.

23:00.462 --> 23:03.295
COLONEL SLOANE, ARE THERE
STILL MAJOR LEAGUES?

23:03.382 --> 23:05.794
MY DAD USED TO TELL
ME ALL ABOUT BASEBALL

23:05.885 --> 23:07.216
AND THE WORLD SERIES.

23:07.303 --> 23:08.793
TWO LEAGUES,
SAME AS BEFORE.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.219
AMERICAN AND NATIONAL.

23:10.306 --> 23:12.047
WHAT CITY HAS
THE DODGERS NOW?

23:12.141 --> 23:13.597
STILL LOS ANGELES.

23:13.684 --> 23:16.392
THEY CAME IN TENTH
LAST SEASON.

23:16.437 --> 23:17.802
LET'S IMPROVISE
A BALL AND A BAT

23:17.897 --> 23:20.059
THEY DESPERATELY
NEED A PITCHER.

23:20.149 --> 23:24.234
AFTER VVE'RE FINISHED HERE, LET'S
IMPROVISE A BALL AND A BAT.

23:24.320 --> 23:27.028
IT'S MUCH TOO HOT FOR
THAT KIND OF ACTIVITY.

23:27.114 --> 23:28.946
WE MIGHT SING
HERE IN THE CAVE.

23:29.033 --> 23:31.195
WE HAVEN'T DONE
THAT IN SOME TIME.

23:31.285 --> 23:34.152
<i>WHY DON'T WE SHOW THE COLONEL
THE MUSIC WE CAN MAKE?</i>

23:34.246 --> 23:36.453
LET'S LET HIM HEAR
SOME REAL HARMONY.

23:51.639 --> 23:54.472
[cheering and clapping]

23:54.558 --> 23:56.640
[whistling]

23:56.727 --> 23:58.434
(female voice)
TWO MORE.

23:58.520 --> 24:05.358
(male voice) COME
ON, BABY, COME ON.

24:05.444 --> 24:08.357
THAT IS THE UNIVERSAL
LANGUAGE, CAPTAIN.

24:08.447 --> 24:09.357
BASEBALL?

24:09.448 --> 24:11.064
MM-HMM.

24:11.158 --> 24:13.445
YOU HAVE A VERY LIMITED
VOCABULARY, COLONEL.

24:13.535 --> 24:15.151
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

24:15.245 --> 24:17.737
WHAT THE TEMPERATURE
IS OUT HERE RIGHT NOW?

24:17.831 --> 24:20.869
VVELL, NOT BY DEGREES BUT
CERTAINLY BY DISCOMFORT.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.076
AT THIS TIME OF DAY
IT'S ABOUT 110.

24:23.170 --> 24:25.332
DON'T KNOW ABOUT
YOUR CREW MEMBERS

24:25.422 --> 24:27.163
BEING ABLE TO STAND
THAT HEAT,

24:27.257 --> 24:29.464
BUT I DO KNOW
ABOUT MY OWN PEOPLE.

24:29.551 --> 24:33.010
THEY'RE GOING TO SUFFER FOR
THIS LITTLE ATHLETIC E\/ENT.

24:33.097 --> 24:35.555
FOR SOME OF THE OLDER PEOPLE,
IT MIGHT BE SERIOUS.

24:35.641 --> 24:37.973
AW, IT'S ONLY
A GAME, BENTEEN.

24:38.060 --> 24:39.550
IF THEY'RE SUFFERING,

24:39.645 --> 24:42.262
MY GUESS IS THAT IT
MIGHT BE WORTH IT.

24:46.568 --> 24:50.607
COLONEL, VVHEN VVE GET ABOARD
YOUR SHIP, YOU'LL BE IN COMMAND.

24:50.698 --> 24:53.110
YOU TELL US WHAT TO DO,
WHERE TO GO,

24:53.200 --> 24:55.282
AND WE'LL FALL
RIGHT INTO LINE.

24:55.369 --> 24:57.485
BUT HERE,
IN THIS PLACE,

24:57.538 --> 24:59.028
I'M IN COMMAND.

24:59.123 --> 25:00.739
NOW, MR. BENTEEN...

25:00.833 --> 25:02.540
CAPTAIN BEN...

25:02.626 --> 25:05.163
I'M NOT TRYING TO USURP
YOUR AUTHORITY, CAPTAIN.

25:05.254 --> 25:06.710
I JUST DON'T SEE
WHAT HARM

25:06.797 --> 25:08.379
A LITTLE BASEBALL
GAME COULD BE.

25:08.465 --> 25:10.672
THAT'S NOT YOUR CONCERN,
IS IT, COLONEL?

25:10.718 --> 25:13.756
THE VVELL-BEING OF THESE
PEOPLE, THEIR HEALTH...

25:13.846 --> 25:15.803
THAT'S MY CONCERN.

25:20.853 --> 25:23.515
[crowd cheering]

25:23.564 --> 25:27.023
GALAXY CREW MEMBERS,
INSIDE THE SHIP.

25:27.067 --> 25:28.353
LOWER THE PORT.

25:28.444 --> 25:29.775
( <i>Groaning</i> )

25:29.862 --> 25:31.398
NOW, MY FRIENDS,
TIME TO REST.

25:31.488 --> 25:33.445
GO TO YOUR HOMES.

25:33.532 --> 25:35.944
I'LL ANNOUNCE
WHEN THE NEW DAY WILL BEGIN.

25:36.035 --> 25:37.525
GO TO YOUR HOMES.

25:52.217 --> 25:53.469
HAPPY NOW, CAPTAIN?

25:53.552 --> 25:55.168
I WAS NEVER UNHAPPY.

25:55.262 --> 25:57.003
I KNOVV WHAT'S RIGHT
AND WHAT'S VVRONG.

25:57.097 --> 25:58.929
I SEE.

25:59.016 --> 26:01.257
COLONEL, I HA\/E TO ASK YOUR
MEN TO STAY ON THE SHIP

26:01.351 --> 26:02.807
DURING THE REST PERIOD.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.556
I DON'T WANT
THE PEOPLE DISTRACTED.

26:04.646 --> 26:06.853
YOU DO HAVE A
WEIGHTY FIST, CAPTAIN.

26:06.940 --> 26:09.557
HAD IT BEEN ONE OUNCE LIGHTER,
THERE'D BE NO ONE HERE

26:09.610 --> 26:11.521
TO GO BACK WITH
YOU, COLONEL.

26:11.612 --> 26:17.073
L'\/E HELD THESE PEOPLE TOGETHER- BY VVILL.
JUST BY VVILL.

26:17.117 --> 26:19.609
THEY'D HA\/E DIED IF THEY HADN'T
HAD SOMEONE TO HANG ONTO.

26:19.703 --> 26:21.740
<i>THEY'D HAVE
WITHERED AWAY.</i>

26:21.830 --> 26:23.662
HMM.

26:23.749 --> 26:26.992
VVELL, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO
VVITHER AVVAY NOVV, CAPTAIN.

26:27.086 --> 26:28.918
WHY DON'T YOU JUST RELAX?

26:28.962 --> 26:32.421
THAT'S A LUXURY I'\/E NEVER
BEEN ABLE TO AFFORD.

26:32.466 --> 26:34.423
I'VE NEVER TAKEN A WIFE.

26:34.468 --> 26:38.086
L'\/E NEVER BEEN ABLE TO
THINK ONLY OF MYSELF.

26:38.180 --> 26:39.511
I'VE...

26:39.598 --> 26:44.092
I'VE BEEN
CONFESSOR, GOVERNOR,

26:44.186 --> 26:46.348
FATHER FIGURE,
IF YOU WILL.

26:46.438 --> 26:48.270
AND IF I HADN'T BEEN,

26:48.357 --> 26:50.519
<i>THERE'D BE NO
LIFE HERE TODAY.</i>

26:50.609 --> 26:53.021
THOSE ARE MY
PEOPLE, COLONEL.

26:53.112 --> 26:55.604
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

26:55.656 --> 26:57.146
MYPEOPLE.

27:03.497 --> 27:05.113
WHAT'S WITH HIM,
COLONEL?

27:05.165 --> 27:06.496
WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM?

27:06.583 --> 27:08.620
OH, SUFFER HIM
A WHILE LONGER.

27:08.669 --> 27:11.832
HE'S REALLY QUITE
A GUY, YOU KNOW.

27:11.922 --> 27:13.708
QUITE A GUY.

27:13.799 --> 27:16.541
HE JUST HAS
ONE ABERRATION:

27:16.635 --> 27:18.842
HE THINKS HE'S A GOD.

27:18.929 --> 27:21.136
AND WE'RE BOOTING HIM
OUT OF HIS HEAVEN.

27:27.646 --> 27:32.140
<i>(me/e presenter) TWILIGHT ZONE I/V/LL

28:16.195 --> 28:17.356
COLONEL SLOANE?

28:17.446 --> 28:18.607
<i>(Sloane)
YES.</i>

28:18.697 --> 28:20.062
CAPTAIN BENTEEN IS HERE.

28:20.157 --> 28:24.276
OH, YES.

28:24.369 --> 28:26.531
OH, COME IN, CAPTAIN.
COME IN.

28:26.580 --> 28:27.786
COLONEL.

28:27.873 --> 28:30.535
WELL, HOW
ARE YOU TODAY?

28:30.584 --> 28:31.949
FINE. THANK YOU.

28:32.044 --> 28:33.705
I HAVE A LIST
OF YOUR PASSENGERS,

28:33.754 --> 28:35.870
AND THEIR
APPROXIMATE WEIGHTS.

28:35.964 --> 28:38.581
ALSO, THE WEIGHT
OF THEIR BELONGINGS

28:38.675 --> 28:40.086
NOTED AFTER EACH NAME.

28:40.177 --> 28:41.588
WE WEIGHED ON OUR SCALE,

28:41.678 --> 28:43.294
AND I'M AFRAID
IT'S AN OLD-TIMER,

28:43.388 --> 28:44.970
UNDERWEIGHS ABOUT
FIVE POUNDS.

28:45.057 --> 28:48.721
ALL I WANTED WAS AN
APPROXIMATION, CAPTAIN.

28:48.769 --> 28:50.476
OH, THIS WILL
DO JUST FINE.

28:50.562 --> 28:52.599
WE'LL WEIGH THEM OUT
ON OUR OWN EQUIPMENT

28:52.689 --> 28:55.147
BEFORE WE BLAST
OFF ANYWAY.

28:55.234 --> 28:58.067
WELL, CAPTAIN,
TODAY'S WEDNESDAY.

28:58.111 --> 28:59.647
TOMORROW WE LEAVE.

28:59.738 --> 29:02.730
TOMORROW YOU GO BACK
TO MOTHER EARTH.

29:02.783 --> 29:06.151
BACK TO MODERN TIMES.

29:06.245 --> 29:07.610
THOUGH I
HONESTLY WONDER

29:07.704 --> 29:09.570
WHETHER lT'LL BE
TO YOUR LIKING.

29:09.665 --> 29:11.531
BECAUSE THE WAY
YOU'LL BE LIONIZED

29:11.625 --> 29:13.536
WHEN YOU GET
BACK TO EARTH...

29:13.627 --> 29:16.244
YOU'RE REFERRED TO IN THE
PRESS AS "THE LOST PIONEERS."

29:16.338 --> 29:18.921
THEY'RE GONNA MAKE QUITE A THING
OUT OF YOU VVHEN YOU LAND.

29:18.966 --> 29:20.456
I SUPPOSE
IT'S INEVITABLE.

29:20.550 --> 29:22.803
THAT SEEMS
TO BE YOUR FATE.

29:22.886 --> 29:24.593
AND WHEREVER
YOUR PEOPLE SETTLE,

29:24.680 --> 29:26.341
THEY'LL BE MET
BY BRASS BANDS,

29:26.431 --> 29:28.923
WELCOMING COMMITTEES,
KEYS TO THE CITY...

29:28.976 --> 29:32.264
KEYS TO THE CITY.

29:32.354 --> 29:34.345
YEAH, THE GOVERNMENT
HAS HAD INQUIRIES

29:34.439 --> 29:36.976
FROM LITERALLY
THOUSANDS OF RELATIVES.

29:37.067 --> 29:39.934
THEY'LL JUST HA\/E TIME TO
LOOK INTO A TELEVISION CAMERA

29:40.028 --> 29:42.440
AND THEN THEY'LL SCATTER
ALL OVER THE 5O STATES.

29:42.531 --> 29:44.613
WE WON'T BE SCATTERED,
WE'LL GO TOGETHER.

29:46.618 --> 29:48.859
I VVAS TALKING ABOUT VVHEN YOU
GET BACK ON EARTH, CAPTAIN.

29:48.954 --> 29:50.444
OH, SO AM I, COLONEL.

29:50.497 --> 29:51.953
WE WON'T BE SPLITTING UP.

29:52.040 --> 29:54.122
NOT THOSE PEOPLE,
NOT MY PEOPLE.

29:54.167 --> 29:55.953
WE'LL STAY TOGETHER.

29:56.003 --> 29:58.495
YOU MEAN THIS IS VVHAT
YOU'VE ALL DECIDED TO DO?

29:58.588 --> 30:01.171
NO DECISION
WAS NECESSARY.

30:01.258 --> 30:03.966
YOU HAVE ASKED THEM,
HAVEN'T YOU?

30:04.052 --> 30:07.636
COLONEL, ASKING THEM VVOULD BE
EXACTLY LIKE ASKING A CHILD

30:07.681 --> 30:09.797
IF HE WANTS SOME
MORE ICE CREAM.

30:09.850 --> 30:12.717
THEY'RE CHILDREN, COLONEL.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.973
THE MAJORITY OF
THEM ARE ADULTS.

30:15.063 --> 30:16.724
CHRONOLOGICALLY, YES.

30:16.815 --> 30:19.307
THEY RANGE IN AGE FROM
6 MONTHS TO 6O YEARS.

30:19.359 --> 30:22.351
BUT PSYCHOLOGICALLY AND
SOCIALLY, THEY'RE CHILDREN.

30:22.446 --> 30:26.405
I'VE KEPT THESE PEOPLE ALIVE
AND TOGETHER ALL THESE YEARS.

30:26.491 --> 30:28.073
WHEN WE GET
BACK TO EARTH,

30:28.160 --> 30:30.401
I WILL SIMPLY HAVE TO
CONTINUE THE PROCESS.

30:30.495 --> 30:32.486
HAVE YOU
TOLD THEM THIS?

30:32.539 --> 30:35.998
THERE'S NO NEED TO TELL THEM,
THEY KNOVV IT ALREADY.

30:36.084 --> 30:42.171
YOU MEAN THEY KNOW THAT
AFTER 3O YEARS OF WAITING,

30:42.215 --> 30:44.172
AFTER 3O YEARS OF
LIVING IN A COMPOUND,

30:44.217 --> 30:46.299
THAT THEY'RE GONNA
TRAVEL A BILLION MILES

30:46.386 --> 30:48.423
JUST TO WALK SINGLE FILE
INTO ANOTHER ONE.

30:48.513 --> 30:50.379
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE IT
ANY OTHER WAY.

30:50.474 --> 30:54.092
COLONEL, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND,
AND I DON'T BLAME YOU,

30:54.186 --> 30:56.348
THAT THESE
PEOPLE ARE CHILDREN.

30:56.396 --> 30:58.854
AND TO TRANSPORT
THEM A BILLION MILES

30:58.940 --> 31:02.683
AND THEN LAND THEM IN A STRANGE
PLACE AND ABANDON THEM

31:02.736 --> 31:04.693
WOULD BE AN
ACT OF CRUELTY.

31:04.780 --> 31:06.691
<i>IT WOULD BE A CRIME.</i>

31:06.782 --> 31:09.865
WOULD YOU DO ME
A SMALL FAVOR, CAPTAIN?

31:09.910 --> 31:10.866
<i>OF COURSE.</i>

31:10.911 --> 31:12.822
ASK THEM.

31:17.209 --> 31:20.622
OUTSIDE THE CITIES ON EARTH,
THERE ARE SUBURBAN AREAS.

31:20.712 --> 31:24.626
THIS WAS A MAJOR LIVING CHANGE
THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE 1950s:

31:24.716 --> 31:27.424
DECENTRALIZATION OF
THE POPULATION AREAS.

31:27.511 --> 31:29.548
THERE'S CERTAIN ASPECTS
OF EARTH LIVING

31:29.638 --> 31:31.254
THAT WE SHOULD
TOUCH ON PASSING.

31:31.348 --> 31:33.555
<i>WE WILL NOT
CONCERN OURSELVES</i>

31:33.600 --> 31:35.932
<i>WITH LIVING IN THE COLDER
AREAS, THE NORTHEASTERN STATES</i>

31:36.019 --> 31:38.556
<i>OR SOME UPPER SECTIONS
OF THE GREA T PLAINS.</i>

31:38.647 --> 31:41.480
CAPTAIN, I WANT
TO LIVE IN WISCONSIN.

31:41.566 --> 31:44.399
SO YOU BETTER TELL US
ABOUT FROSTBITE.

31:44.444 --> 31:45.980
[laughter]

31:46.071 --> 31:47.607
WHAT ABOUT THE STATE
OF OREGON?

31:47.697 --> 31:50.405
THAT'S WHERE BETTY AND I
WANT TO SETTLE.

31:50.450 --> 31:52.282
<i>I CAN REMEMBER
THE FORESTS THERE.</i>

31:52.369 --> 31:54.576
VVHAT ABOUT THE EASTERN
SEABOARD, CAPTAIN?

31:54.621 --> 31:56.157
THE FINGER
LAKE DISTRICT

31:56.248 --> 31:58.285
IN UPPER NEW YORK
STATE, CAPTAIN?

31:58.375 --> 32:00.616
(male voice) IS THERE
STILL A NEW YORK CITY?

32:00.710 --> 32:02.212
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

32:02.295 --> 32:04.582
I'D LIKE TO MAKE
ONE THING VERY CLEAR.

32:04.673 --> 32:06.960
YOU'LL ALL BE ABLE
TO MEET YOUR RELATIVES

32:07.050 --> 32:10.259
AND POSSIBLY VISIT WITH THEM
FOR EVEN A WEEK OR MORE.

32:10.345 --> 32:12.427
<i>BUT WE'LL STAY
TOGETHER AS A COMMUNITY</i>

32:12.514 --> 32:15.097
<i>IN WHATEVER LAND GRANT WE
CAN GET FROM THE GOVERNMENT</i>

32:15.142 --> 32:18.260
<i>OR WHATEVER PRESCRIBED
AREA CAN BE ARRANGED FOR.</i>

32:18.311 --> 32:20.268
I'D ALSO LIKE
TO ASSURE YOU THAT--

32:20.313 --> 32:22.975
AND, I HOPE,
PUT ALL YOUR FEARS TO REST--

32:23.066 --> 32:26.775
I'M CERTAINLY GOING TO CONTINUE
AS YOUR GUIDE AND CONSULTANT.

32:26.820 --> 32:30.609
I GUARANTEE NONE OF YOU WILL
WANT FOR MY HELP OR ADVICE.

32:30.657 --> 32:32.864
CAPTAIN?

32:32.951 --> 32:34.612
JULIE AND I...

32:34.703 --> 32:37.616
JULIE AND I
WERE PLANNING ON FARMING.

32:37.706 --> 32:39.788
<i>THAT'S A WONDERFUL IDEA,
A FINE IDEA.</i>

32:39.875 --> 32:41.616
<i>OF COURSE WE'LL FARM.</i>

32:41.710 --> 32:43.826
AS VVE FARMED HERE, ONLY
BETTER-- MORE RAINFALL.

32:43.920 --> 32:46.457
REMEMBER? I TOLD YOU ABOUT IT.
AND ONE SUN, NOT TVVO.

32:46.506 --> 32:49.294
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SHIELD
YOUR CROPS FROM THE SUN.

32:49.384 --> 32:51.045
THE SUN HELPS THEM.

32:51.136 --> 32:53.503
<i>WE'LL FARM, AL,
CERTAINLY WE'LL FARM.</i>

32:53.597 --> 32:56.806
BUT JULIE HAS RELATIVES
IN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON.

32:56.850 --> 32:58.466
WE'RE GONNA
SETTLE THERE.

32:58.518 --> 33:01.135
IT WOULD BE TOO COLD
FOR YOU THERE, AL.

33:01.188 --> 33:03.680
IT WOULD BE TOO COLD
FOR ALL OF YOU.

33:03.773 --> 33:05.275
NOW, WHEREVER WE SETTLE,

33:05.358 --> 33:07.690
I GUARANTEE THERE
WILL BE GOOD FARMING.

33:07.777 --> 33:09.313
<i>I'LL SEE
TO THAT.</i>

33:15.202 --> 33:17.990
WELL, NOW, WHAT'S
THE MATTER WITH YOU?

33:18.038 --> 33:26.038
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH ALL OF YOU?

33:26.713 --> 33:28.374
YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND, CAPTAIN.

33:28.465 --> 33:30.672
WE, UH...

33:30.717 --> 33:32.924
WE DON'T PLAN
TO STAY TOGETHER.

33:33.011 --> 33:35.048
WELL, YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND, AL.

33:35.138 --> 33:37.926
YOU NEVER DID UNDERSTAND
MUCH OF ANYTHING.

33:38.016 --> 33:40.178
NOW, AL, IF WE DID SPLIT UP,

33:41.853 --> 33:44.686
I SERIOUSLY DOUBT
IF WE COULD SURVIVE.

33:44.731 --> 33:47.598
YOU EXPLAIN IT TO
HIM, AL, GO AHEAD.

33:47.692 --> 33:49.023
YES, GO ON,
TELL HIM, AL.

33:49.069 --> 33:50.525
WE'LL SURVIVE, CAPTAIN.

33:50.612 --> 33:52.694
IF ANY OF US WANT
TO STAY TOGETHER,

33:52.739 --> 33:54.355
THAT'LL BE THEIR RIGHT.

33:54.449 --> 33:56.861
IF ANY OF US VVANT TO
GO OFF ON THEIR OVVN,

33:56.952 --> 33:59.284
<i>(Al) THAT'LL BE
THEIR RIGHT, TOO.</i>

33:59.371 --> 34:02.955
AM I WRONG,
COLONEL?

34:03.041 --> 34:04.907
NO, YOU'RE
NOT WRONG.

34:05.001 --> 34:08.210
OUR ORDERS ARE TO TAKE YOU
BACK TO EARTH AS A GROUP.

34:08.255 --> 34:11.088
ONCE ON EARTH, YOU'RE FREE
TO DO WHATEVER YOU PLEASE.

34:11.174 --> 34:13.290
COLONEL SLOANE,
I TELL YOU NOW

34:13.385 --> 34:17.049
TO LET US SETTLE
OUR DIFFERENCES ALONE.

34:17.138 --> 34:19.721
THERE ARE NO
DIFFERENCES, CAPTAIN.

34:19.766 --> 34:21.552
THERE ARE DIFFERENCES!

34:21.601 --> 34:25.310
THERE ARE CHANGES THAT
HA\/E TAKEN PLACE ON EARTH

34:25.397 --> 34:27.559
THAT NONE OF US
ARE PREPARED FOR.

34:27.649 --> 34:30.812
NOW, THESE... THESE PEOPLE,

34:30.902 --> 34:33.234
<i>THEY MAKE IT SEEM
LIKE A BIG HOLIDAY,</i>

34:33.321 --> 34:35.813
<i>LIKE EVERYTHING'S EASY,
LIKE THE GOOD LIFE...</i>

34:35.907 --> 34:37.568
<i>YOU CAN PLUCK IT
OFF A TREE!</i>

34:37.659 --> 34:39.900
WELL, MY PEOPLE,

34:39.953 --> 34:43.161
I DON'T VVANT ANY ONE OF
YOU TO BE DISILLUSIONED.

34:43.248 --> 34:45.080
I TELL YOU NOW

34:45.125 --> 34:49.335
THAT WHEREVER MEN LIVE,
THEY GRUB AND THEY STRUGGLE.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.331
THEY DIG TO STAY ALIVE.

34:51.422 --> 34:52.833
THIS I KNOW.

34:52.924 --> 34:56.087
THIS IS TRUE, THIS IS A FACT.

34:56.136 --> 35:01.347
BUT TOGETHER--
THAT'S THE WORD, TOGETHER--

35:01.433 --> 35:04.846
WE MUST STAY TOGETHER.

35:04.936 --> 35:07.519
<i>I WANT YOU TO
THINK OF THAT NOW</i>

35:07.606 --> 35:10.769
<i>AND I WANT YOU TO
SAY IT WITH ME OUT LOUD.</i>

35:10.859 --> 35:13.271

35:13.320 --> 35:15.311
"TOGETHER."

35:15.405 --> 35:16.941

TOGETHER.

35:16.990 --> 35:18.651

36:50.458 --> 36:51.914
WELL, I FIGURED OUT

36:52.001 --> 36:54.129
THE COMPARTMENT
ASSIGNMENTS, CAPTAIN.

36:54.212 --> 36:56.374
I'D LIKE TO GO
OVER THEM WITH YOU.

36:56.464 --> 36:58.296
THE COMPARTMENT
ASSIGNMENTS.

36:58.383 --> 36:59.873
THERE ISN'T MUCH TIME.

36:59.926 --> 37:01.883
WE STILL HAVE
CHECKING TO DO.

37:01.928 --> 37:03.885
THERE'S A DECOMPRESSION
PROBLEM,

37:03.972 --> 37:05.963
ALSO A MOMENT
OF WEIGHTLESSNESS

37:06.057 --> 37:08.264
SHORTLY AFTER WE LEAVE
THE ATMOSPHERE...

37:08.351 --> 37:11.139
COLONEL, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT WE CALLED YOU?

37:11.229 --> 37:12.731
THE MESSIAH.

37:12.772 --> 37:15.890
WE CALLED YOU
THE MESSIAH.

37:15.984 --> 37:17.395
YOU DID?

37:17.485 --> 37:20.898
WE SAID YOU'D
BRING...FREEDOM.

37:20.989 --> 37:24.072
THAT'S NOT WHAT
YOU'VE BROUGHT AT ALL.

37:24.117 --> 37:25.983
WHAT DID WE
BRING, CAPTAIN?

37:26.077 --> 37:28.910
SELFISHNESS.

37:28.997 --> 37:31.739
DISSATISFACTION,
DIVISIVENESS.

37:31.791 --> 37:34.249
WITH ALL THE MISERY
WE'VE HAD HERE,

37:34.294 --> 37:37.958
THOSE WERE GERMS
WE NEVER SUFFERED.

37:38.047 --> 37:39.913
CAPTAIN BENTEEN, UH...

37:39.966 --> 37:43.084
I BROUGHT NOTHING
BUT A SHIP AND A CREW--

37:43.136 --> 37:45.594
UH, A MEANS OF ESCAPE.

37:45.638 --> 37:48.972
YOU SAY YOU HAVE
NO DISEASES, NO VIRUSES.

37:49.058 --> 37:51.925
WELL, HAS IT EVER
OCCURRED TO YOU WHY?

37:51.978 --> 37:55.187
IT'S BECAUSE YOU LIVE
IN A TEST TUBE, CAPTAIN.

37:55.273 --> 37:57.435
ANTISEPTIC
AND GERM-FREE.

37:57.484 --> 37:59.270
AND ALSO STERILE.

37:59.360 --> 38:02.489
OH, SURE, YOU'RE A GROUP,
SURE, YOU'RE A CELL,

38:02.572 --> 38:04.483
BUT THAT'S ALL OVER
WITH NOW, CAPTAIN.

38:04.574 --> 38:08.033
NOVV IT'S TIME TO BE VVHAT
GOD MEANT YOU TO BE-

38:08.119 --> 38:09.496
INDIVIDUALS.

38:09.579 --> 38:11.820
A MAN, A WOMAN,
A CHILD, A BEING.

38:11.915 --> 38:14.282
IT'S TIME TO BREAK
THAT TEST TUBE.

38:14.375 --> 38:16.958
IT'S TIME TO REJOIN
THE RACE OF MEN.

38:17.045 --> 38:20.629
I REMEMBER THE RACE
OF MEN, COLONEL.

38:20.715 --> 38:25.585
I REMEMBER THE EARTH.

38:25.637 --> 38:27.924
IT'S INCREDIBLE.

38:27.972 --> 38:31.306
ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE.

38:31.392 --> 38:34.054
FOR 3O YEARS,
I'VE BEEN WRONG.

38:34.145 --> 38:36.477
3O YEARS I'\/E BEEN
LYING TO MY PEOPLE.

38:36.564 --> 38:41.650
L'\/E TOLD THEM ABOUT AN
EARTH THAT DOESN'T EXIST.

38:41.736 --> 38:45.070
I'VE TOLD THEM ABOUT
AN IMAGINARY GARDEN.

38:45.156 --> 38:48.319
I'VE BEEN TELLING THEM ABOUT A
PLANET A BILLION MILES AVVAY

38:48.409 --> 38:51.492
THAT HAS NO MORE
SUBSTANCE THAN A WISH.

38:51.579 --> 38:54.287
WE CAN'T GO BACK
TO EARTH, COLONEL.

38:54.332 --> 38:58.576
IT'S TOO LATE FOR US.

38:58.670 --> 39:01.332
WE CANNOT GO BACK THERE.

39:06.594 --> 39:09.837

39:32.036 --> 39:34.528
I VVANT TO TELL YOU SOME
THINGS ABOUT THE EARTH

39:34.622 --> 39:36.704

HEARD BEFORE.

39:36.791 --> 39:38.202
THINGS THAT ARE UGLY.

39:38.293 --> 39:40.705
THINGS THAT ARE WRONG.

39:40.795 --> 39:45.289
THINGS THAT CANNOT
BE LIVED WITH.

39:45.383 --> 39:47.545
THERE IS VIOLENCE ON EARTH.

39:47.594 --> 39:49.835
THERE ARE HATREDS.

39:49.929 --> 39:51.840
<i>AND JEALOUSY .</i>

39:51.931 --> 39:54.423

39:58.688 --> 40:01.680
<i>THE EARTH IS A PLACE

40:01.774 --> 40:06.268
IT IS A SOCIETY

IF WE LEAVE HERE...

40:09.699 --> 40:15.615
WE WILL DIE, WE WILL <i>D/E!</i>

40:15.705 --> 40:17.446
<i>WE'LL BE
COMMITTING SUICIDE</i>

40:17.540 --> 40:19.406
<i>IF WE GO BACK

40:19.459 --> 40:21.120
<i>WE WILL DIE</i>

40:21.210 --> 40:26.296

NEVER EXPERIENCED BEFORE--

40:26.382 --> 40:29.625
LONELINESS.

40:29.719 --> 40:36.432
LONELINESS, LIKE
ANIMALS IN A ZOO.

40:36.476 --> 40:41.971
WE DO NOT BELONG THERE.

40:42.065 --> 40:46.650
<i>WE DO NOT BELONG

WE DO NOT BELONG THERE.

40:54.327 --> 40:55.943
CAPTAIN BENTEEN?

40:56.037 --> 40:58.495
VVHY DON'T YOU LET YOUR
CHILDREN \/OTE ON IT?

40:58.581 --> 41:02.245
ONLY IF THEY KNOW
WHAT'S WAITING FOR THEM.

41:02.335 --> 41:07.501
ONLY IF THEY KNOVV THAT THE
EARTH IS NOT A GARDEN.

41:07.590 --> 41:09.581
NEVER WAS A GARDEN!

41:09.676 --> 41:12.418
AND IT NEVER
WILL BE A GARDEN.

41:12.512 --> 41:13.502
FAIR ENOUGH!

41:13.596 --> 41:17.931
FAIR ENOUGH.

41:18.017 --> 41:20.258
THEN I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT EARTH IS.

41:20.353 --> 41:25.519
IT'S A RACE OF MEN,
STRUGGLING FOR SURVIVAL.

41:25.608 --> 41:27.519
JUST AS YOU
HAVE SURVIVED.

41:27.610 --> 41:29.521
AND CAPTAIN BENTEEN
IS QUITE RIGHT

41:29.612 --> 41:31.148
<i>WHEN HE TELLS YOU</i>

41:31.239 --> 41:32.695

41:32.782 --> 41:34.193
<i>WE MAY YET HAVE WARS</i>

41:34.283 --> 41:36.536

REMAINS PREJUDICE.

41:36.619 --> 41:38.860
AND I SUPPOSE
AS LONG AS MEN WALK

41:38.955 --> 41:42.664
THERE WILL BE ANGRY MEN,
JEALOUS MEN, UNFORGIVING MEN.

41:42.709 --> 41:47.203
BUT IT HAS ONE THING
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE.

41:47.296 --> 41:49.333
ONE THING.

41:49.382 --> 41:51.874
IT LETS EVERY MAN
BE HIS OWN MASTER.

41:51.968 --> 41:54.335
<i>THERE WON'T BE
ANY CAPTAIN BENTEENS</i>

41:54.387 --> 41:55.969

<i>AND JOYCE VAN PATTEN.</i>

50:40.412 --> 50:42.540
I'M PREPARED TO PAY YOU DOUBLE
THE AMOUNT OF YOUR TICKETS

50:42.623 --> 50:43.954
IF YOU'LL ABANDON
YOUR PLANS.

50:44.041 --> 50:45.702
NOT A CHANCE.

50:45.793 --> 50:49.377
YOU'RE DRIVING
ME TO EXTREMES.

50:49.463 --> 50:51.625
HOWEVER, IF YOU LEAVE
THE LADYANNE NOW,

50:51.715 --> 50:53.626
<i>I'LL GIVE YOU
THE EQUIVALENT</i>

50:53.717 --> 50:55.299
OF 5,000
AMERICAN DOLLARS.

50:55.386 --> 50:56.672
AND I'LL
MATCH THAT.

50:56.762 --> 50:58.719
MAKING IT A TOTAL
OF 10,000.

50:58.806 --> 51:00.217
EVER SINCE WE
PICKED THIS TUB,

51:00.307 --> 51:01.718
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
TRYING THEIR BEST

51:01.809 --> 51:03.140
TO DISCOURAGE US.
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

51:03.227 --> 51:04.308
FORGET IT.

51:04.395 --> 51:05.931
AND LEAVE US ALONE.

51:06.021 --> 51:07.557
GREAT NEWS.
VERY IMPORTANT,

51:07.648 --> 51:09.434
SINCE WE'VE BEEN
TALKING IT OVER,

51:09.525 --> 51:11.391
MILLIE AND OLD BURGESS
AND THE REST OF US,

51:11.485 --> 51:13.476
AND WE'VE
COME TO THE CONCLUSION

51:13.571 --> 51:15.562
<i>THAT YOU WON'T HAVE TO
LEAVE THE SHIP AFTER ALL.</i>

51:15.656 --> 51:17.397
WHAT MY HUSBAND
IS TRYING TO SAY

51:17.491 --> 51:20.483
IS THAT YOU WON'T
HAVE TO DIE AFTER ALL.
