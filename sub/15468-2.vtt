Osu, Grasshopper.

01:40.225 --> 01:41.852
Osu, Grandmaster.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.604
-You're here early.
-No, I'm here right on time.

01:44.688 --> 01:48.817
- Yo, how did he get in here?
- Um, this is the Fantastic Four Plus One.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.944
Yeah, this is the crew.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.405
This is my wordsmith.

01:53.488 --> 01:56.325
He's the dude that
rocked the mic at your jam.

01:57.284 --> 01:58.910
Osu, Grandmaster.

01:58.994 --> 02:01.288
Over here, I got the system set up.

02:01.371 --> 02:03.290
Organized just like yours, man.

02:03.373 --> 02:07.419
Matching Technics SL-23 turntables,
just like yours.

02:07.502 --> 02:09.378
If I could just show you...

02:11.048 --> 02:12.466
Woo-hoo.

02:15.010 --> 02:17.346
All right,
everyone sit zazen in front of me.

02:25.896 --> 02:28.106
Sneaking out of the house
in the middle of the night,

02:28.190 --> 02:29.691
you're gonna get grounded.

02:29.858 --> 02:33.111
But I know this is not how
you wanted to spend your summer.

02:33.195 --> 02:37.574
It's fine. Five days a week in a soup
kitchen might be the best thing for me.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.951
Look at you.

02:40.035 --> 02:43.413
My baby's becoming a woman.
What happened to your friend Ezekiel?

02:43.497 --> 02:45.832
Papi said he's not
playing piano for us no more.

02:45.916 --> 02:47.000
I don't know.

02:47.959 --> 02:50.420
What a shame.
That boy never missed a beat.

02:50.545 --> 02:51.713
<i>Buenos días.</i>

02:51.797 --> 02:55.092
-Cisco. I'm surprised to see you here.
-One for you.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.761
The punished girl can have a treat, right?

02:59.054 --> 02:59.930
My savior.

03:00.013 --> 03:03.558
Live out your sentence with dignity,
and you shall soon be free.

03:05.435 --> 03:08.063
Until then... head high.

03:10.857 --> 03:13.193
Universal DJ rule 17, Grasshopper.

03:13.276 --> 03:15.612
"In order to fly,
a DJ must trust his wings."

03:15.695 --> 03:17.614
-And are these your wings?
-Yes, Grandmaster.

03:17.697 --> 03:19.408
Then you must learn to trust them.

03:20.617 --> 03:23.829
I have, in my hand, the key
to my Quick Mix theory.

03:23.912 --> 03:26.373
- A crayon, Grandmaster?
- What's the crayon for?

03:26.456 --> 03:27.416
Nice.

03:27.499 --> 03:29.459
- You're not messing with me?
- No.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.336
Well, what about the get-down?

03:31.420 --> 03:33.422
You were supposed to show me
how to do what you do.

03:33.505 --> 03:36.383
Do not underestimate the crayon.

03:39.803 --> 03:43.390
I promised you the secret,
not the answer, Grasshopper.

03:43.473 --> 03:47.519
To earn the answer,
you must solve the mystery as one.

03:47.602 --> 03:51.440
And when you unlock the gate,
we will walk through it together as one.

03:52.357 --> 03:55.318
Put your hand out
in the position of Sun Tzu's offering.

03:55.402 --> 03:57.779
I hand you the magic,

03:57.863 --> 04:00.907
the mystery, the opening, Grasshopper.

04:01.616 --> 04:05.662
You have 24 hours, or my offer expires.

04:05.746 --> 04:06.955
Osu.

04:08.331 --> 04:12.043
Twenty-four hours.

04:15.297 --> 04:18.341
- Fixing Jesus?
<i>- Sí.</i>

04:18.425 --> 04:21.928
I thought he was supposed to be fixing us.
A little bit to the left there.

04:22.012 --> 04:23.472
<i>Eso, eso, eso.</i>

04:27.726 --> 04:29.144
I brought you an Icee.

04:29.227 --> 04:30.896
Lemon-cherry.

04:30.979 --> 04:33.398
-I'm not hungry.
-It ain't steak, bro.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.235
Why you here, Francisco?

04:37.319 --> 04:41.698
So, a little <i>pajarito </i> in the tree tells me
you're struggling to fill seats here.

04:41.782 --> 04:46.745
As it happens, I see a bunch of sinners
on my walk over...

04:47.579 --> 04:50.165
- I tell them about Sunday service.
- Is that so?

04:50.248 --> 04:53.460
<i>Seguro que sí.</i> Bro, you gonna have
about a dozen more <i>Boricuas </i> here

04:53.543 --> 04:55.253
just looking to see the light.

04:55.337 --> 04:58.006
You better bring out the secret weapon.

04:58.089 --> 04:59.174
Secret weapon?

05:00.133 --> 05:03.678
- You mean Mylene?
- That's why everybody comes here, right?

05:04.554 --> 05:07.557
I mean, of course and...
you're great, too.

05:07.641 --> 05:10.185
Just trying to help.
If you want me to tell them not to come--

05:10.268 --> 05:12.771
No, no, no.
You did the right thing.

05:18.568 --> 05:19.653
<i>Oye...</i>

05:20.403 --> 05:21.822
Myle, she...

05:23.240 --> 05:25.367
she came to me the other night
pretty rattled.

05:25.450 --> 05:28.036
-Because she defied me.
-Defied you?

05:28.119 --> 05:30.455
She's a teenager.
That's what they do. They defy.

05:30.539 --> 05:33.166
Yes, but my job
is to protect her from herself.

05:33.250 --> 05:37.629
<i>Esta bien,</i> and I support that.
But your grip, man, it's too tight.

05:38.213 --> 05:39.589
You gotta loosen up a little bit.

05:39.673 --> 05:42.551
She's not your daughter.
She's my daughter.

05:42.634 --> 05:45.887
You... You're lucky
I don't cut her off from you.

05:45.971 --> 05:47.681
- Cut her off?
- Ramon?

05:47.764 --> 05:49.683
-<i>¿Todo bien?</i>
-Jesus' pin-up girl.

05:49.766 --> 05:51.685
-Diablo.
-We're just finishing here, Lydia.

05:52.519 --> 05:55.021
Okay. Take your time.

05:57.274 --> 06:00.443
Cut me off? Then cut me off, man.
Are you threatening me?

06:00.527 --> 06:01.945
You're a bad influence.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.364
She sees your lifestyle. She sees it.

06:04.447 --> 06:08.326
- Easy come, easy go.
- The-- The money.

06:08.410 --> 06:11.788
Yeah, the money that paid for the
fucking opera house that you had to have?

06:11.871 --> 06:14.332
I can go back to street preaching
if I have to.

06:14.416 --> 06:15.917
I answer to Christ our Savior.

06:16.001 --> 06:18.795
You know, you need to get off
of your high, proud horse, Ramon.

06:18.878 --> 06:21.381
I need you to speak to me of pride?
I know where that sin leads.

06:21.464 --> 06:25.176
And no daughter of mine is going to go
where I have been. Now you stay--

06:25.260 --> 06:26.303
Man--

06:30.515 --> 06:31.683
Keep away from her, Francisco.

06:34.936 --> 06:37.063
I apologize, <i>hermano.</i>

06:39.649 --> 06:43.570
Forgive me for trying to talk sense
into His Holiness.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.329
There you are.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.955
Inspector Mooch.

06:54.039 --> 06:56.416
Annie, most days I can tolerate
Sonny Boy here

06:56.499 --> 06:58.835
and his charming, mirthful disposition.

06:58.918 --> 07:01.296
-This is not one of those days.
-Get lost a while, Clarence.

07:01.379 --> 07:04.049
But if this concerns the shooting,
this concerns business.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.384
And if this concerns business,
this concerns me.

07:06.468 --> 07:08.428
-Say it walking, Clarence.
-Better obey Mommy.

07:13.391 --> 07:14.309
Devil.

07:15.185 --> 07:17.812
Yeah, I know. The drug business.

07:17.896 --> 07:20.398
I'm shutting everything down
until this thing calms down.

07:20.482 --> 07:22.525
-Good.
-Look, I'm losing money here.

07:22.609 --> 07:25.403
-Who's behind shooting up my club?
-Don't know yet.

07:25.487 --> 07:27.864
But make no mistake, this was a hit.

07:27.948 --> 07:28.865
A hit on you.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.368
And what I can tell you for certain

07:31.451 --> 07:34.371
is the dead assassin
was a Savage Warlord, El Viejo.

07:34.454 --> 07:37.290
He was their chief.
So, whoever paid them to do this,

07:37.374 --> 07:39.668
the Warlords took the gig serious.

07:39.751 --> 07:42.337
-Think Harlem paid them to take me out?
-Maybe.

07:42.420 --> 07:45.840
I want more for my money than maybes,
Moran.

07:49.427 --> 07:50.720
You and me both.

07:50.804 --> 07:54.641
Look, I'm neck-deep in this myself.
I will get to the bottom of this.

07:54.724 --> 07:58.937
In the meantime, I'd love for your boys
at Bronx homicide to get off my back

07:59.020 --> 08:02.440
and get my club reopened.
I can handle the rest.

08:03.733 --> 08:07.445
El Viejo had a little brother in the gang.
Napoleon.

08:07.529 --> 08:09.072
Have Wolf and Sonny Boy find him.

08:09.155 --> 08:10.407
-Bring him in.
-I can do that.

08:11.157 --> 08:12.993
And please...

08:14.369 --> 08:16.037
no more dead bodies,

08:16.121 --> 08:19.499
or we will have a problem
that even I can't solve.

08:22.794 --> 08:27.298
"I hand you the magic, Grasshopper."

08:28.133 --> 08:30.885
"Do not underestimate the crayon."

08:30.969 --> 08:32.595
Look at Dizzee.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.889
"You must solve the mystery as one."

08:34.972 --> 08:37.558
What the fuck
are you looking at it like that, bro?

08:37.642 --> 08:39.102
It's just so elegant.

08:40.895 --> 08:46.818
<i> ♪ A hip, a hop</i>
<i>A hip, a hip, a hop, a hip, a hop ♪</i>

09:03.668 --> 09:05.920

09:06.588 --> 09:08.715
- No, you get it. You got it.
- I get it.

09:11.634 --> 09:12.469
Yo.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.138
Be serious, nigga.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.557
We only got like 20 hours left.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.853
"Twenty-four hours,
or my offer expires."

09:44.626 --> 09:47.045
Hey, <i>qué tal</i>, Cisco?

09:47.128 --> 09:48.588
You wanted to see me?

09:49.172 --> 09:50.882
This is such bullshit, man.

09:50.965 --> 09:52.175
The house is white.

09:52.258 --> 09:54.135
The picket fence is white.

09:54.219 --> 09:57.722
But do all the model people
have to be white?

09:57.806 --> 09:59.432
These motherfuckers.

10:00.266 --> 10:02.936
They can't even conceive...

10:04.020 --> 10:07.107
of brown people,
black people owning homes, man.

10:07.190 --> 10:09.818
That's messed up. Yo, what is all this?

10:10.568 --> 10:12.362
That's the future, man.

10:12.445 --> 10:16.533
-That's 'cause you're a visionary, man.
-And I'm building it.

10:16.616 --> 10:17.659
Lopez...

10:18.910 --> 10:20.578
can you bring us a couple of Yoo-hoo's?

10:22.205 --> 10:27.377
- So... how's the music biz, maestro?
- I need a vacation.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.797
I'm producing three albums
by two top-20 artists.

10:30.880 --> 10:35.969
On top of which, I sold these up-tempo
ballads to Diana Ross and Tony Orlando.

10:36.052 --> 10:37.804
Did you get those, 
the record albums?

10:37.887 --> 10:41.182
And the, and the Tangier Records
satin jackets that I left for you?

10:41.266 --> 10:44.060
I did.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.354
That's not the package
I was looking for, Jackie.

10:46.437 --> 10:49.566
Cisco, I know I'm-- I know I'm behind.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.819
You know, from the poker games,
you know, that I owe you.

10:53.361 --> 10:55.905
Twenty-five grand, music man.

10:56.614 --> 10:59.075
It's not to me.
The good brothers of <i>Hijos Boricuas.</i>

10:59.159 --> 11:03.246
The house, I know that, and I got
the money, but, you know, it's not liquid.

11:03.329 --> 11:07.333
It's currently, temporarily...
It's accounting, Cisco.

11:07.417 --> 11:09.794
You know, it's like these snafus,
you know?

11:09.878 --> 11:13.298
Jackie, your payment
is long past due, man.

11:13.965 --> 11:16.843
And the <i>Hijos Boricuas,</i>
they're not patient like I am.

11:16.926 --> 11:19.345
And their club bylaws,
the bylaws are very clear.

11:19.429 --> 11:21.014
<i>¡La violencia!</i>

11:21.848 --> 11:23.308
Violence...

11:25.018 --> 11:26.686
is discouraged...

11:28.438 --> 11:29.856
but not prohibited.

11:30.940 --> 11:34.402
-Cisco, me and you got history.
-Come on, man.

11:34.485 --> 11:37.530
- I mean...
- Please.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.198
Stop, bro.

11:39.282 --> 11:40.450
I don't know.

11:41.409 --> 11:44.871
I guess, maybe,
if you were to do me a favor...

11:44.954 --> 11:46.539
Absolutely.

11:49.083 --> 11:50.543
Something legal, though, right?

11:50.668 --> 11:52.795
It's better than legal, Jackito.

11:53.463 --> 11:55.673
This shit... is spiritual.

11:56.799 --> 12:00.637
Man, what if...?
What if there ain't no mystery, man?

12:00.720 --> 12:02.722
Yo, what you talking about, Ra?

12:03.473 --> 12:06.601
Look, man... what if...

12:07.393 --> 12:10.146
what if Flash just straight
played us, man?

12:10.229 --> 12:12.523
He right. Give me...

12:12.649 --> 12:14.484
We're staring at a crayon.

12:14.567 --> 12:15.985
A crayon.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.362
Like we're special ed.

12:17.987 --> 12:21.574
And the only mystery I know
is how your ass fell for that shit.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.076
Hey, yo. Chill out, both of you.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.036
Grandmaster's real.

12:25.703 --> 12:26.913
I'm real.

12:26.996 --> 12:30.416
This crayon,
I don't understand it yet, but it's real.

12:30.500 --> 12:33.920
And if you ain't real, it's time to bounce
your little midget ass outta here.

12:34.003 --> 12:36.005
Go find Snow White
and the rest of the Six Dwarves.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.465
And you, too, nigga.

12:37.548 --> 12:40.051
Shao, breathe man, breathe.

12:40.134 --> 12:42.053
We still got 18 hours.

12:42.679 --> 12:43.846
Shi--

12:43.930 --> 12:47.183
-I'm sorry. I was literally just trying--
-My fucking crayon!

12:47.266 --> 12:48.977
Your wall is just bumpy, man!

12:49.060 --> 12:50.853
- I'm fucking sorry, bro!
- Yo, hey!

12:50.937 --> 12:52.563
Hey. Hey, bro, I'm sorry!

12:53.147 --> 12:54.899
-Hey.
-Thought if I drew something on the wall,

12:54.983 --> 12:57.235
something would incarnate,
like a portal or something, bro.

12:57.318 --> 12:58.611
I'm so fucking sorry, man.

12:58.695 --> 13:01.280
-It's like Harold, man.
-Who the fuck is Harold, Dizzee?

13:01.364 --> 13:04.409
-Harold and the goddamn magic crayon.
-Harold, man.

13:05.451 --> 13:06.619
Come on. Let's go.

13:06.703 --> 13:09.080
Mom making that Rice-A-Roni
with that non-federal cheese

13:09.163 --> 13:10.540
and that ground-meat chili.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.041
I'm just out, man.

13:13.543 --> 13:14.669
I'm sorry, Shao.

13:15.837 --> 13:16.838
Let's roll, Ra.

13:19.716 --> 13:21.092
Yo, peace, E.

13:22.051 --> 13:24.095
- Yeah. You can go, too, if you need to.
- No. No.

13:24.178 --> 13:25.638
If I'm gonna rhyme, I need a beat.

13:25.722 --> 13:28.683
One that don't retire 'cause Ma's
making Rice-A-Roni with real cheese

13:28.766 --> 13:31.019
-and the chili ground meat.
-You can get yourself dinner.

13:31.102 --> 13:35.398
I need a DJ who spins 1010 WINS
and don't give up over no crayon, man.

13:36.274 --> 13:38.568
Here comes the judge and I'm the lawyer.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.153
He Huck Finn and I'm Tom Sawyer.

13:40.236 --> 13:44.741
-I-- I get it, man.
-If you believe in Flash, then I do, too.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.582
<i>True as the night turns black</i>

13:52.665 --> 13:54.167
<i>This ain't no fairy tale</i>

13:56.669 --> 13:59.213
<i>Never drawn no moon</i>
<i>For a midnight stroll</i>

14:00.715 --> 14:03.342
<i>With all them dope fiends to regale</i>

14:05.511 --> 14:09.265
<i>But what if you trade one needle</i>
<i>For another?</i>

14:09.724 --> 14:12.518
<i>Ain't alone no more</i>
<i>'Cause now I'm your brother</i>

14:13.770 --> 14:15.980
<i>Don't gotta look through</i>
<i>Rose-colored glasses</i>

14:16.064 --> 14:18.733
<i>To see you out the shadows</i>
<i>Rising out the ashes</i>

14:20.401 --> 14:24.280
<i>Me and you</i>
<i>Let's spin it in a different mode</i>

14:24.364 --> 14:26.449
<i>All we gotta do is crack the code</i>

14:28.785 --> 14:31.287
<i>Purple crayon</i>
<i>Lock and key</i>

14:32.038 --> 14:34.457
<i>From desert sands</i>
<i>Through forest trees</i>

14:35.750 --> 14:37.752
<i>What could be your mystery?</i>

14:44.967 --> 14:46.636
<i>"Let's quit," she said</i>

14:48.346 --> 14:49.847
<i>But I won't quit</i>

14:53.351 --> 14:55.436
<i>Forget blank pages</i>
<i>I wanna live my life</i>

14:55.520 --> 14:56.729
<i>Amazing, outrageous, sure</i>

14:56.813 --> 14:58.523
<i>But when I step on the stage</i>

14:59.690 --> 15:03.403
<i>Whoa, in my head</i>
<i>From off the page</i>

15:04.487 --> 15:06.197
<i>What more do you want from me?</i>

15:08.533 --> 15:10.076
<i>Can't you see what I could be?</i>

15:13.538 --> 15:14.831
<i>Purple crayon</i>

15:16.416 --> 15:17.834
<i>My possibility</i>

15:37.353 --> 15:38.771
Hey, Mama.

15:38.855 --> 15:41.023
When you was my age,
what did you wanna be?

15:42.066 --> 15:45.069
-I wanted to be a good, obedient daughter.
-No.

15:45.153 --> 15:49.073
Like, if you could've been anything...
what would it be?

15:49.157 --> 15:51.659
I didn't think like that, <i>querida.</i>

15:52.452 --> 15:56.038
Well, I just thought that,
maybe, if you had a dream,

15:56.122 --> 15:58.791
you could understand.

15:58.875 --> 16:00.710
- Hello.
<i>- Lydia, I need Mylene.</i>

16:00.793 --> 16:03.129
<i>I gotta make her a dress.</i>
<i>It's going to be ivory.</i>

16:03.254 --> 16:05.548
<i>-¿La niña? ¿Ahora?</i>
<i>-Mira, es importante.</i>

16:05.631 --> 16:08.092
<i>-I had a vision from God.</i>
<i>-¿De verdad?</i>

16:08.176 --> 16:10.761
<i>Get her here please, por favor, pronto.</i>

16:10.845 --> 16:12.096
-Okay.
<i>-Ciao, baby.</i>

16:13.931 --> 16:18.478
Señora Lopez wants you to go
to her dress shop for measurements.

16:19.061 --> 16:21.689
-She's insisting.
-Me? For what?

16:21.772 --> 16:25.568
She said she had a vision from God,
and it was you in an ivory dress.

16:25.651 --> 16:28.571
Of course she has a vision
when I'm locked in soup jail.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.576
And Dad grounded me.

16:33.659 --> 16:35.286
How am I gonna go to the dress shop?

16:38.748 --> 16:40.791
I wanted to be a veterinarian.

16:40.875 --> 16:44.253
-What?
-When I was young, that was my dream.

16:44.337 --> 16:45.838
A dream.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.341
Shoot.

16:48.424 --> 16:50.593
You know,
I gotta send somebody to the store.

16:51.469 --> 16:54.514
It'll probably take a long time.

16:54.597 --> 16:55.765
It's a big list here.

17:07.359 --> 17:08.569
Tight, right?

17:09.069 --> 17:11.739
Ooh, ooh. Okay, let's see.

17:11.821 --> 17:13.616
Let's get you out here.

17:13.699 --> 17:15.242
Made the coop myself.

17:15.326 --> 17:19.789
All right, Penny... meet Zeke.
Zeke, meet Penny.

17:20.289 --> 17:21.207
Careful.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.501
Let her know that you're calm
and in control.

17:23.584 --> 17:24.752
She'll settle down.

17:25.461 --> 17:27.505
-Just like the ladies, right?
-Yeah.

17:28.714 --> 17:31.008
Dang, this is kind of cool.

17:31.092 --> 17:32.885
All right. So, you ready for the show?

17:36.931 --> 17:37.974
Hold this down.

17:39.642 --> 17:41.269
Hold it down.

17:41.352 --> 17:42.728
Okay, here we go.

17:43.312 --> 17:44.522
-You ready?
-Yeah.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.649
Open it up. Come on.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.943
Come on out. Come on out, guys.
Come on out. Come on out.

17:49.026 --> 17:50.987
Come on out. Come on out. Come on out.

17:53.155 --> 17:54.824
Come on out. Come on out.
Come on out.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.284
Come on, come on, come on.

17:56.409 --> 17:59.078
Yeah. Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

17:59.203 --> 18:00.788
Whoo!

18:02.623 --> 18:05.126
-They do that natural, or they was taught?
-They do it natural.

18:05.668 --> 18:09.046
Everything they do,
it got a natural purpose.

18:09.547 --> 18:11.549
Nigga got wings,
a nigga gotta fly, right?

18:11.632 --> 18:13.050
I wish I could fly.

18:15.386 --> 18:17.096
Last night you were writing, weren't you?

18:17.638 --> 18:18.681
So?

18:18.764 --> 18:20.766
So, it probably means you're smart.

18:21.392 --> 18:22.685
I mean, I ain't dumb.

18:23.352 --> 18:27.148
So, when you're off... being all smart
and reading and writing

18:27.231 --> 18:31.485
and thinking on smart shit,
you're flying, man.

18:31.569 --> 18:32.862
Like Flash.

18:33.362 --> 18:35.031
-How he controls the crowd.
-I guess, yeah.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.116
How he moves the crowd, man.

18:38.284 --> 18:39.201
That's...

18:39.744 --> 18:42.288
That's gonna be my... my flying.

18:43.205 --> 18:47.126
<i>♪ Fly, fly ♪</i>

18:53.174 --> 18:55.676
-You ever thought of quitting?
-What?

18:56.469 --> 18:59.013
You talking about the crayon?
Man, we gonna get that shit.

18:59.096 --> 19:01.515
No, no, no. Inferno.

19:01.641 --> 19:04.685
-You talking about hustling?
-You're working for drug dealers.

19:04.769 --> 19:08.105
Trigger-happy gangsters,
shooting people who don't deserve to die.

19:08.773 --> 19:11.567
Man, that's how I earn my keep. But...

19:12.276 --> 19:13.986
I do got some money saved up.

19:14.570 --> 19:17.365
Maybe take a summer holiday,
focus on the get-down.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.200
I'll focus on my rhyming.

19:20.618 --> 19:22.453
Throw some parties, get some girls...

19:23.037 --> 19:25.039
not named Mylene.

19:28.626 --> 19:30.753
A little vacation could be good.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.755
-No bosses.
-Just music.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.006
All day, every day.

19:35.883 --> 19:38.010
Nigga got wings, nigga gotta fly, right?

19:40.471 --> 19:42.473
Like these pigeons and shit.

19:44.058 --> 19:45.142
Circling.

19:45.893 --> 19:46.727
Spinning.

19:47.603 --> 19:49.313
Spinning and grinning?

19:49.397 --> 19:51.482
Spinning and grinning, Zeke.

19:51.565 --> 19:54.568
Spinning and grinning, man.

19:55.653 --> 19:56.904
Spinning.

19:57.780 --> 19:59.699
Spinning and spinning.

20:00.366 --> 20:01.367
Yo.

20:02.284 --> 20:04.036
<i>The get-down plays on one...</i>

20:04.120 --> 20:06.455

20:21.220 --> 20:23.013
All right. Play it again.
Just the get-down.

20:23.097 --> 20:24.306
All right. All right.

20:24.390 --> 20:26.308
I gotta find it.

20:26.434 --> 20:28.602
See, you say you gotta find it, right?

20:28.686 --> 20:30.396
Maybe this shit will help.

20:30.479 --> 20:31.689
-Got it?
-All right.

20:31.772 --> 20:34.358
- That's it?

Damn.

21:13.522 --> 21:16.192
<i>♪ It takes two to make a thing go right ♪</i>

21:26.827 --> 21:27.912
Coming.

21:28.662 --> 21:30.164
Hi, is Ezekiel home?

21:31.165 --> 21:33.793
- Who's asking?
- Tell them Jehovahs to get out of here.

21:33.876 --> 21:35.711
I'm his English teacher, Ms. Green.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.798
-You must be...?
-His aunt, Wanda.

21:39.465 --> 21:41.634
-Isn't school out?
-I just wanted to check in with him.

21:41.717 --> 21:44.845
- He left his essay in my office.
- Okay. Thank you.

21:44.929 --> 21:47.139
I also-- I wanted to talk to you.

21:49.266 --> 21:51.143
Your nephew's one
of my brightest students,

21:51.227 --> 21:55.189
and there's this program
run by Francisco Cruz.

21:55.272 --> 21:58.108
You know, from the community center?
Ezekiel could go to college.

21:58.192 --> 22:00.236
He can go to an Ivy League college.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.404
-But we really need to start now.
-Ivy League?

22:02.488 --> 22:03.489
Yes.

22:04.365 --> 22:06.242
Who's gonna pay? You?

22:07.952 --> 22:10.788
That kid spends enough time
in the clouds, okay?

22:10.871 --> 22:15.626
It's hard as it is to keep him here
in the real world. This is not helping.

22:15.709 --> 22:20.256
Ezekiel knows a whole lot more
about the real world than you think.

22:20.881 --> 22:22.508
Why don't you do him a favor?

22:23.175 --> 22:25.010
Just read that.

22:31.809 --> 22:34.061
I thought you were gonna help me
when you came to church.

22:34.144 --> 22:36.021
-Why you ain't at the dress shop?
-I--

22:36.564 --> 22:38.107
Wait, how did you know about that?

22:38.190 --> 22:42.069
Because I'm gonna owe Señora Lopez
like an arm for fibbing to your mother.

22:42.152 --> 22:42.987
You set that up?

22:43.153 --> 22:45.531
<i>Seguro que yes.</i>
I'm sitting there waiting for you.

22:49.034 --> 22:50.786
Now imagine, it's Sunday.

22:51.996 --> 22:56.041
You step forward for your solo...
in your pretty new dress.

22:56.166 --> 22:57.835
Maybe a flower in your hair.

22:57.918 --> 22:59.169
Nothing too decadent.

22:59.253 --> 23:00.462
A lily.

23:00.546 --> 23:01.964
And in that moment...

23:04.341 --> 23:06.385
you gonna shine, <i>niña.</i>

23:06.969 --> 23:10.014
I want you to act like it's the last song
you ever gonna sing.

23:10.097 --> 23:14.935
Because in the crowd, there's gonna be
a man in a fancy suit, not me.

23:15.019 --> 23:18.939
-A music producer.
-I knew it. I fucking knew it.

23:19.023 --> 23:21.066
-Hey. <i>Respeta.</i>
-Sorry. <i>Lo siento.</i>

23:21.150 --> 23:23.986
Hey, this has gotta be a secret.
Your parents cannot know.

23:25.988 --> 23:28.073
Thank you, <i>tío.</i>

23:28.240 --> 23:29.908
Ya-ya-ya-ya.

23:29.992 --> 23:32.286
Now get to the dress shop
before we both get found out.

23:32.369 --> 23:33.245
Okay.

23:33.704 --> 23:35.414
<i>-Niña.</i>
-<i>Sí.</i>

23:35.497 --> 23:38.292
You make us all proud?

23:40.127 --> 23:41.837
- <i>Oye,</i> it's Francisco.
<i>- Hola.</i>

23:41.920 --> 23:43.714
- Myle's on her way. 
<i>- Esta bien.</i>

23:43.881 --> 23:45.424
Remember what I said about the dress.

23:45.507 --> 23:46.508
Make it simple but modest.

23:46.675 --> 23:48.344
<i>Pero que acentúe su cuerpo.</i>

23:48.469 --> 23:51.513
No, no, no.
Don't accentuate nothing, I mean it.

23:51.597 --> 23:54.183
She gotta shine,
but she gotta do it in God's house.

23:54.308 --> 23:57.186
<i>Claro</i>, Francisco.
<i>Muy sencillo. No te preocupes.</i>

23:57.269 --> 23:59.897
Yeah. "Don't worry."
"Don't worry," my ass.

24:31.428 --> 24:34.306
Ooh. That looks lovely.

24:34.390 --> 24:37.643
Sit down and have some with me.

24:38.644 --> 24:40.688
I like my steak well done.

24:40.771 --> 24:42.856
I like my mens well done.

24:42.940 --> 24:45.359
But a good steak's like a prize fight.

24:45.943 --> 24:48.112
It ain't good unless it's bloody.

24:48.195 --> 24:49.530
Check that.

24:54.243 --> 24:57.454
Can I talk to you a minute?

24:57.538 --> 24:59.623
-I got an opportunity, Annie.
-Opportunity?

24:59.707 --> 25:02.751
It's nothing that competes
with what's going on here.

25:02.835 --> 25:05.546
-You leaving here?
-Just for a while.

25:05.629 --> 25:06.588
I mean, yes.

25:07.089 --> 25:09.049
Yes, I'm leaving here.

25:09.174 --> 25:10.634
Can I have your blessing?

25:11.343 --> 25:13.303
I've invested in you.

25:13.429 --> 25:16.598
I've been grooming you.
I was about to promote you.

25:17.808 --> 25:18.976
I'm disappointed.

25:19.351 --> 25:22.312
It's something good for me, Annie,
and I'm good at it.

25:22.396 --> 25:25.983
-A music thing, you know?
-You got the gift for graft, boy.

25:26.066 --> 25:28.777
-And you wanna go blow a horn?
-It's not a horn. It...

25:29.445 --> 25:31.613
-It's--
-It doesn't matter what it is.

25:31.905 --> 25:33.907
You overestimate yourself.

25:33.991 --> 25:37.161
Another ghetto clown
thinks he's Miles Davis.

25:37.244 --> 25:40.789
Ends up miles from putting food
on the table, a roof overhead.

25:44.334 --> 25:45.169
Okay.

25:52.760 --> 25:55.596
When you need the other half of this,
you come see Annie.

25:56.513 --> 25:59.850
But it ain't gonna be so easy here
for you the next time.

26:01.268 --> 26:02.478
<i>Well done.</i>

26:02.561 --> 26:06.982
You unlocked the secret of the crayon,
but that's only the first step.

26:07.065 --> 26:10.402
Now once you've marked the get-down part,
you must dig.

26:10.486 --> 26:14.364
Dig, dig, dig a tunnel
where the get-down sits.

26:15.199 --> 26:17.493
All right,
now pay attention and listen to this.

26:18.952 --> 26:21.580
<i>-♪ Don't go breaking my heart ♪</i>
-Now you hear that?

26:21.663 --> 26:25.542
That is a void of useless nothing.
The wackness.

26:25.626 --> 26:26.502
But here we go.

26:30.547 --> 26:34.510
That is life and destiny.

26:34.593 --> 26:38.889
That is the get-down beat.
That is what the B-boys get down to.

26:38.972 --> 26:45.103
Now, because he possesses two turntables,
a DJ exists in two time zones, all right?

26:45.187 --> 26:49.441
One turntable plays music that the dancers
are partying to right now,

26:49.525 --> 26:51.109
and the other is playing music

26:51.193 --> 26:54.112
that they will be partying to
in the imminent future.

26:54.196 --> 26:55.781
Now...

26:55.864 --> 26:57.658
Future. All right?

26:57.741 --> 26:58.909
Check this out.

26:59.868 --> 27:01.995
Now pay attention,
and watch my hands.

27:02.079 --> 27:05.707
Remember, Grasshopper,
it's all about math.

27:05.791 --> 27:08.460
Watch the mark.

27:12.047 --> 27:15.342
-So, be in the moment, yes.
-But give the future your attention.

27:15.425 --> 27:17.052
Exactly, wordsmith.

27:17.135 --> 27:20.013
Making sure the get-down part
is ready to depart, all right?

27:20.222 --> 27:22.474

27:22.558 --> 27:27.229

27:28.230 --> 27:29.356
Under the needle.

27:29.439 --> 27:31.650
Wait. What is...
What does "under the needle" mean?

27:31.733 --> 27:34.403
That means the beat is locked,
loaded and ready to go.

27:36.280 --> 27:38.240
Now that beat is fresh, right?

27:38.323 --> 27:40.534
But you're racing
against the imminent wackness.

27:40.617 --> 27:42.911
So, remember it's all about math,
Grasshopper.

27:43.871 --> 27:47.916
Two, three, four. Check.

27:48.000 --> 27:48.876
Under the needle.

27:48.959 --> 27:51.503
One, two, three, four.

27:51.628 --> 27:55.215
- Ooh. You see that?
- Two, three, four.

27:55.299 --> 27:57.259
Check. Under the needle.

27:57.342 --> 27:59.720
One, two, three, four.

27:59.803 --> 28:03.223
You must be like Bruce Lee,
young Grasshopper. Flow like water.

28:04.224 --> 28:07.603
It must be zen, in the moment.
It's a sonic and physical fight.

28:08.186 --> 28:10.606
Whoo. Look at him go, Books.

28:10.689 --> 28:13.191
Never in disarray. Every time.

28:13.275 --> 28:15.068
Arrive, depart.

28:15.611 --> 28:17.404
Arrive, depart.

28:19.156 --> 28:21.450
Now first...

28:21.533 --> 28:23.744
you must master one record.

28:24.578 --> 28:28.582
Manifest one single, infinite beat.

28:29.499 --> 28:30.417
And, Grasshopper...

28:31.710 --> 28:36.214
choose one you can live with
for a looonnnng time.

28:36.298 --> 28:39.593
So choose wisely, or madness be thy name.

28:39.676 --> 28:41.929
- Madness?
- You'll see.

28:42.012 --> 28:47.517
Excruciating torment,
Chinese water-torture madness.

28:51.688 --> 28:53.065
How did you do that, Grandmaster?

28:53.190 --> 28:56.652
I know time.

29:00.447 --> 29:03.992
-You fucking see that, man?
-He walked around the whole room.

29:04.076 --> 29:06.828
Man. I fucking told you.
I told you.

29:06.912 --> 29:10.290
-And he came back on the beat. Man.
-On the beat. That was--

29:10.374 --> 29:11.291
I told you, didn't I?

29:13.710 --> 29:15.629
Your uncle
got a hot record producer

29:15.712 --> 29:17.381

29:17.464 --> 29:21.927
Listen, you gotta sing better than Donna
and Gloria and Thelma put together.

29:22.010 --> 29:25.514
Yeah. Some next-level shit.

29:28.558 --> 29:30.227

29:51.039 --> 29:53.041
Mylene, no.

29:53.625 --> 29:58.547
You can't sing that crusty Jesus shit
to some hotshot music man.

29:58.630 --> 30:01.091
Hello?
Are you forgetting where I'm singing?

30:01.174 --> 30:03.468
At least the song shows my range.

30:03.552 --> 30:05.595
Please tell me you're joking.

30:08.682 --> 30:11.268
Fuck. You're not.

30:11.351 --> 30:14.646
You're right.
There's no way a producer's gonna be like:

30:14.730 --> 30:19.067
"Yo, that girl right there praising Jesus,
she's the next disco star of America."

30:19.151 --> 30:21.737

-This is my joint right here.

- So, who's this for, anyway?

to be helping the South Bronx

44:16.529 --> 44:18.156

44:38.301 --> 44:39.510

44:44.140 --> 44:45.141
I know.

44:45.224 --> 44:47.768
- I never get why.
- Collect the insurance money.

44:47.852 --> 44:50.479
If it's more than they're making in rent,
it's profitable, I guess.

44:51.522 --> 44:54.025
Yo, is that our spot?

44:54.108 --> 44:56.235

44:56.319 --> 44:58.404
- Shao!
- My fucking records!

44:58.613 --> 44:59.864
Hey, they didn't--

44:59.947 --> 45:00.990
What about the rest of the gear?

45:01.073 --> 45:03.951
- I got the turntable.
- You left the records?

45:43.491 --> 45:44.784
Yo, Shao!

45:44.867 --> 45:46.160

46:26.283 --> 46:28.494

46:59.316 --> 47:01.360
He could hire us for some extra help.

47:01.444 --> 47:04.655
We could make money, replace everything
we lost without selling our asses

47:04.739 --> 47:06.657
-to Fat Annie and--
-"Selling our ass"?

47:06.741 --> 47:08.951

47:20.629 --> 47:24.050

What?

51:23.038 --> 51:25.582
-Papi, my solo.
-No, no, no. No more solos.

51:25.666 --> 51:27.042
-<i>Por favor</i>, Papi--
-I am sorry.

51:27.126 --> 51:29.086
I wish I had come to it sooner.

51:29.878 --> 51:31.630
And may the Lord forgive us both.

51:33.590 --> 51:34.883
Now you go.

51:53.819 --> 51:55.112
Praise him!

51:57.114 --> 51:59.116
<i>A nuestro senor.</i>

52:03.746 --> 52:06.623
See the truth. <i>La verdad.</i>

52:06.707 --> 52:09.376
Praise him, sister. Praise him, sister.

52:09.460 --> 52:10.669
Yes. Yes.

52:10.753 --> 52:12.671
Thank you, Jesus. Praise him.

52:12.755 --> 52:14.882
<i>A nuestro Señor.</i>

52:17.051 --> 52:18.218
<i>Buenos días.</i>

52:19.178 --> 52:20.637
<i>¿Cuál es tu nombre?</i>

52:20.721 --> 52:23.974
-Jackie.
-Jackie. Welcome, Jackie.

52:24.933 --> 52:28.187
Jackie, the Lord has a message for you.

52:28.270 --> 52:30.397
<i>Paciencia y fe.</i>

52:30.481 --> 52:32.232
<i>Paciencia y fe.</i>

52:38.947 --> 52:40.282
<i>Gracias Señor.</i>

52:40.366 --> 52:42.951
<i>¡Porque murió Jesús Cristo!</i>

52:46.497 --> 52:49.333
By whose grace do we walk?

52:50.959 --> 52:53.003
Praise him. Praise him!

52:53.504 --> 52:56.590
Let him fill you with <i>conviccion profunda</i>.

52:59.093 --> 53:00.803
Praise him. Praise God.

53:12.564 --> 53:14.942
Let him fill you with the Holy Spirit.

53:15.025 --> 53:18.404
<i>Espíritu Santo. Espíritu Santo.</i>

53:18.487 --> 53:19.822
Hallelujah!

53:28.997 --> 53:30.374
<i>Yo veo la maldad.</i>

53:30.457 --> 53:32.709
I see the evil in your eyes.

53:32.793 --> 53:35.963
You have many talents.
Why do you throw them away?

53:39.133 --> 53:40.342
<i>¡Ante la gloria de Dios!</i>

53:40.426 --> 53:41.510
<i>¡Ante la gloria de Dios!</i>

45:53.334 --> 45:54.460
Shao.

45:56.253 --> 45:58.673
At least Dizz got a turntable,
you see that?

45:59.340 --> 46:01.634
I mean, it's kind of crispy, but right?

46:04.720 --> 46:06.430
You okay, Shao?

46:11.143 --> 46:12.645
Never better, B.

46:13.813 --> 46:15.439
Never better.

46:16.440 --> 46:19.568
You tender-hearted, Books.
I like that about you.

46:20.194 --> 46:22.947
But that shit back there ain't nothing
more than supply and demand.

46:23.030 --> 46:26.200
Now we the ones in need of supply
of cash for our new equipment.

46:26.283 --> 46:28.494
And we gotta go out there and demand it.

46:28.577 --> 46:30.621
Shaolin, I should've known
you was already on

46:30.705 --> 46:34.083
-to masterminding a new master plan.
-So, what you think?

46:36.127 --> 46:38.629
Tomorrow, go to Les Infernos,
see Fat Annie.

46:38.713 --> 46:41.007
She give us some work, we make crazy loot.

46:41.090 --> 46:43.009
Quick fast, in a hurry.

46:43.926 --> 46:45.511
I don't like that place.

46:46.470 --> 46:48.431
Definitely don't like
that motherfucker, Cadillac.

46:48.514 --> 46:51.392
Yo, it ain't about what you like.
You down for the cause or not?

46:51.475 --> 46:54.854
I'm down by law, B.
Fantastic Four Plus One all day, but yo...

46:54.937 --> 46:58.315
I mean, my uncle, he...
he's a handyman, you know?

46:58.399 --> 46:59.233
He's always hustling.

46:59.316 --> 47:01.360
He could hire us for some extra help.

47:01.444 --> 47:04.655
We could make money, replace everything
we lost without selling our asses

47:04.739 --> 47:06.657
-to Fat Annie and--
-"Selling our ass"?

47:06.741 --> 47:08.951
Yo, who the fuck is selling they ass?
Not me.

47:09.035 --> 47:10.786
-No, I'm saying--
-Not me, nigga.

47:10.870 --> 47:12.329
I'm saying let's go see my uncle.

47:12.413 --> 47:14.457
I ain't counting pennies
with your damn uncle.

47:14.540 --> 47:17.877
-Well, I ain't working for Fat Annie.
-Then get out my way.

47:18.919 --> 47:20.546
Step aside, nigga.

47:20.629 --> 47:24.050
No, I can't. 'Cause you and me,
we a team, remember? I got your back.

47:24.133 --> 47:28.512
And not in that fake, corny, "wherever
you go, I go," mack-bullshit kind of way.

47:28.596 --> 47:30.056
No, I mean for real.

47:30.139 --> 47:31.223
Me, you and the crew.

47:31.307 --> 47:34.727
Tonight, Shao, man, we were
the fucking Fantastic Four Plus One.

47:34.810 --> 47:38.355
And I quote my DJ when I say one day
we're gonna be bigger than the Yankees,

47:38.439 --> 47:41.317
biggest thing in the whole Bronx,
biggest thing in the whole world.

47:41.400 --> 47:43.402
Fantastic Four Plus One
has our own plan of attack.

47:43.486 --> 47:45.738
We don't need to sell out
to no gangster motherfuckers--

47:45.821 --> 47:49.283
Shut the fuck up, man!
I'm Shaolin Fantastic, B.

47:49.366 --> 47:51.994
I make magic, you make excuses.

47:52.078 --> 47:55.956
This ain't Disneyland,
this shit is the fucking Bronx.

47:56.040 --> 47:57.875
Either you be strong, or you be gone.

47:57.958 --> 48:00.419
All I find, all I keep.

48:00.503 --> 48:02.922
Either you beat the world,
or you get beat.

48:05.341 --> 48:08.511
Yo... you ever see me again...

48:09.178 --> 48:11.972
nigga, cross the street.

48:14.266 --> 48:15.601
Fucking wordsmith.

48:16.268 --> 48:17.853
Wonderbread ass.

48:47.299 --> 48:49.301
<i>A pious man and his gal</i>

48:51.762 --> 48:55.516
<i>They had a child</i>

49:02.148 --> 49:04.191
<i>Raised in the Bronx</i>

49:08.154 --> 49:10.239

49:12.408 --> 49:14.952

49:23.085 --> 49:25.421
<i>And the dears</i>

50:04.418 --> 50:06.545
<i>Sí,</i> we all love Mrs. Carmela

50:06.629 --> 50:10.341
but, well, the church needs more people
like you, Ezekiel.

50:10.424 --> 50:13.385
Talented and lively and bright.

50:13.469 --> 50:15.429
We'd be happy to have you
play for us today.

50:15.512 --> 50:17.264
<i>Gracias</i>, Señora Cruz.

50:41.205 --> 50:43.040
<i>Mylene, ven aca.</i>

50:47.753 --> 50:49.672
I have examined my soul.

50:51.507 --> 50:53.259
I have made a mistake.

50:56.053 --> 50:57.346
I realize it now.

50:57.429 --> 51:01.183
I have nurtured in you
the cardinal sin of pride.

51:01.267 --> 51:02.351
What do you mean?

51:02.434 --> 51:04.895
They come to hear you sing, <i>es la verdad.</i>

51:04.979 --> 51:11.235
I put you in the spotlight because
I want to fill the seats, to save souls.

51:12.152 --> 51:15.447
Ignoring the damage
to my own daughter's soul.

51:15.531 --> 51:19.159
From now on, you will sing
at the back of the chorus.

51:19.243 --> 51:20.494
What?

51:23.038 --> 51:25.582
-Papi, my solo.
-No, no, no. No more solos.

51:25.666 --> 51:27.042
-<i>Por favor</i>, Papi--
-I am sorry.

51:27.126 --> 51:29.086
I wish I had come to it sooner.

51:29.878 --> 51:31.630
And may the Lord forgive us both.

51:33.590 --> 51:34.883
Now you go.

51:53.819 --> 51:55.112
Praise him!

51:57.114 --> 51:59.116

Praise him, sister. Praise him, sister.

52:09.460 --> 52:10.669
