[Brian] Previously on
What About Brian:

00:01.917 --> 00:05.125
I don't want a relationship.
I want to focus on my career.

00:05.125 --> 00:09.041
You can do both, you know.
Have a career and
a social life. I do.

00:09.041 --> 00:12.917
That's exactly why I'm going
to find a buyer for
this house before you.

00:12.917 --> 00:15.125
I'm the one who destroyed
this marriage.

00:15.125 --> 00:16.625
I can't do this anymore.

00:17.834 --> 00:19.458
Angelo had a great life.

00:19.458 --> 00:23.291
He got married,
we were starting a family.

00:23.291 --> 00:24.875
He finally got a part
in a movie.

00:24.875 --> 00:28.917
He really did do everything
he wanted to do.

00:28.917 --> 00:30.709
- Want a lap dance?
- Yes, please.

00:30.709 --> 00:34.500
- My real name, it's Heather.
- I'm sure Heather
is a great girl.

00:34.500 --> 00:38.166
- But you're throwing
away everything?
- This is Heather Hillman.

00:38.166 --> 00:39.667
We just got married!

00:46.417 --> 00:48.291
The girls are down.

00:48.291 --> 00:50.041
Why do parents
always say that

00:50.041 --> 00:53.542
like you hid behind
the couch and shot them
with a tranquilizer?

00:53.542 --> 00:56.625
- You got a tranquilizer gun?
- Bet they have one at Cosmart.

00:56.625 --> 01:00.083
- They have everything.
- Yeah. What the hell is this?

01:00.083 --> 01:01.583
The food
for Adam's party.

01:01.583 --> 01:03.834
You're throwing
a wedding party for Adam.

01:03.834 --> 01:06.375
Can't serve everybody
pretzels and party mix.

01:06.375 --> 01:08.375
- You're right.
- Of course I'm right.

01:08.375 --> 01:09.834
Gotta have
the mini-quiche.

01:11.208 --> 01:14.083
- Spinach, meat, cheese, bacon.
- What I'm talking about.

01:14.083 --> 01:16.041
- You order the 12-foot subs?
- Yes.

01:16.041 --> 01:20.208
Did you ask Deena to switch
with you next weekend
to help me with the prep?

01:20.208 --> 01:21.875
She's not gonna do it.

01:23.417 --> 01:26.917
- What?
- Dude, it's all about
the nanny days.

01:26.917 --> 01:30.166
I have the girls on weekdays,
Maria picks them up
after school.

01:30.166 --> 01:34.041
If Deena has them on weekends
Maria watches them
while she sells cupcakes.

01:34.041 --> 01:36.250
It's like Maria has them
seven days a week.

01:36.250 --> 01:39.333
You lost me at "nanny days."
Do not let me down
on this party.

01:39.333 --> 01:40.875
It has got to be great.

01:40.875 --> 01:43.542
- Why, for Adam?
- For Adam and also because

01:43.542 --> 01:45.417
I want to invite, um...

01:45.417 --> 01:47.083
- ...Bridget.
- Oh.

01:47.083 --> 01:49.583
Well, she'll
definitely say no.

01:49.583 --> 01:52.917
No, she won't.
I'll get her to come if
it's the last thing I do.

01:52.917 --> 01:55.125
She just needs to get
to know me, at my best,

01:55.125 --> 01:57.750
and that's when I'm with
you guys, all my friends.

01:57.750 --> 02:01.041
First of all,
you're not all that great
when you're with us.

02:01.041 --> 02:03.375
And second of all,
she already rejected you.

02:03.375 --> 02:06.417
- Something's
standing in the way.
- Why you gotta do that?

02:06.417 --> 02:07.917
Go for a girl
you can't have?

02:07.917 --> 02:10.208
- I don't always.
- You always do.

02:10.208 --> 02:13.542
You should take a page
out of Adam's book
and go for the easy pick.

02:13.542 --> 02:16.750
Heather's an easy pick?
A girl who dances naked
for other men?

02:16.750 --> 02:19.417
Listen,
if my wife got naked

02:19.417 --> 02:23.625
and actually danced
for me, I'd be with her
for the rest of my life.

02:23.625 --> 02:26.125
- A simple man
with simple needs.
- Mark my words,

02:26.125 --> 02:29.333
we're throwing
a 50th anniversary party
for Adam and Summer.

02:29.333 --> 02:31.250
- Heather.
- Whoever.

02:31.250 --> 02:34.583
[loud music]

02:43.375 --> 02:47.500
Oh, God. Oh, baby,
we woke you. I am so sorry.

02:47.500 --> 02:50.000
- Hi, Adam.
- Hey, Betty.

02:51.375 --> 02:53.625
Jasheika got thrown out
of her apartment

02:53.625 --> 02:55.500
and she didn't have
anywhere to go.

02:55.500 --> 02:57.333
No, I'm not
coming home!

02:57.333 --> 03:00.166
No, I'm not going
to tell you where I am.

03:00.166 --> 03:02.333
OK, they can be crazy,
but they're sweet.

03:02.333 --> 03:04.166
They need a shoulder
sometimes.

03:04.166 --> 03:05.667
I have to get up
in three hours.

03:05.667 --> 03:08.208
I know. They're leaving, OK?
Come on. Let's...

03:08.208 --> 03:10.000
Oh, wait, you're
gonna eat these?

03:12.959 --> 03:16.291
- What did he say?
- He says he loves me.

03:20.208 --> 03:23.542
- I don't know what to do.
- Yes, you do.
You stand firm.

03:23.542 --> 03:25.291
You don't want
to go back there.

03:25.291 --> 03:28.166
Jasheika, he is
never gonna change.

03:28.166 --> 03:30.125
And you'll never
get out of this rut

03:30.125 --> 03:33.083
until you look in the mirror
and say "I'm a stone fox

03:33.083 --> 03:36.000
- and I don't
deserve this."
- Yeah.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.208
It's like when Heather
was with Manny,

03:38.208 --> 03:40.250
and all that bad stuff
was going down.

03:40.250 --> 03:42.458
- She got out of it.
- Who's Manny?

03:42.458 --> 03:45.333
Ancient history.
I'll tell you
some time.

03:45.333 --> 03:47.667
- [alarm blaring]
- Is that your alarm?

03:47.667 --> 03:50.667
- [Adam] Oh, God!
- Better get in the shower.

03:50.667 --> 03:53.333
Oh, God! Oh, God!

03:57.291 --> 04:01.875
[Nicole] It's the movie
he was doing in Italy...
when he died.

04:01.875 --> 04:05.583
They're having a screening
for distributors
and they're inviting me.

04:07.041 --> 04:09.208
I don't think
I should go.

04:09.208 --> 04:12.125
- Is this your husband?
- Yeah.

04:12.125 --> 04:15.625
If my husband looked like this
I'd never get over him.

04:15.625 --> 04:17.542
[group chuckles]

04:19.917 --> 04:23.166
The hardest thing
about losing my brother

04:23.166 --> 04:26.583
is that I'm never
gonna see him...

04:26.583 --> 04:28.667
...walk into a room again

04:28.667 --> 04:30.917
or hear him talk.

04:30.917 --> 04:33.083
If there was footage
on him anywhere,

04:33.083 --> 04:34.959
I would want to see it.

04:41.583 --> 04:44.458
Topping the leaderboard
once again,

04:44.458 --> 04:46.750

04:46.750 --> 04:49.583
Debuting at number seven,
Mr. Brian Davis.

04:49.583 --> 04:51.709
You probably all think
he just got lucky

04:51.709 --> 04:53.625
being my son
and caught a good gig,

04:53.625 --> 04:55.417
but remember
what I taught you.

04:55.417 --> 04:57.750
In this business
you make your own luck.

04:57.750 --> 04:59.750
Wonder if they got him
a car yet.

05:00.834 --> 05:02.125
Interest rates are down.

05:02.125 --> 05:04.375
We got four new listings
on the Westside.

05:04.375 --> 05:07.250
I want them all in escrow
by the end of the week.

05:07.250 --> 05:08.750
Let's do it.

05:08.750 --> 05:11.625
[chattering]

05:12.750 --> 05:14.333
Congratulations.

05:14.333 --> 05:17.458
- Thank you. You too.
- What was the car comment?

05:17.458 --> 05:21.417
He gets you a company car
if you sell a listing
over $3 million.

05:21.417 --> 05:23.250
- Oh, God.
- Oh, no, take it.

05:23.250 --> 05:26.000
Next time you won't have me
to help you sell a listing.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.667
You won't have me
to get you
your next listing.

05:28.667 --> 05:30.375
[laughs] Hmm.

05:32.750 --> 05:34.917
I'm gonna miss
riding with you.

05:37.542 --> 05:42.000
I'm throwing a party
Friday night at my place.
You want to come?

05:43.125 --> 05:45.375
- I can't.
- Why?

05:46.917 --> 05:49.709
Because I'm kind of seeing
someone off and on.

05:49.709 --> 05:53.458
And what you're asking me
is on a date.

05:53.458 --> 05:57.333
It's a party. We're friends.
I thought we already
figured all this out.

05:57.333 --> 06:00.458
I'm sorry.
I should probably say no.

06:01.625 --> 06:03.458

since I was 15 years old.

11:23.333 --> 11:26.291
There was no money
from the folks
or friends to bail me out.

11:26.291 --> 11:29.834
So I will keep my money
wherever I please.

11:29.834 --> 11:32.375
I'm going to work.
Don't wait up.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.792
- Don't bring the
two strippers over.
- Most men would kill for that.

11:37.792 --> 11:39.000
[door slams]

11:41.458 --> 11:44.458
[Nicole] Thanks for
coming with me, Dave.

11:44.458 --> 11:47.333
I'm kind of excited
to see Angelo again.

11:47.333 --> 11:50.250
I'm nervous, like
he's going to see me.
Isn't that crazy?

11:50.250 --> 11:51.542
Whole thing's crazy.

11:51.542 --> 11:53.583
If you told me
a year ago I'd be single

11:53.583 --> 11:55.542
and Ang would be gone...

11:57.875 --> 12:02.583
Oh, that's Valeria Giacho.
She's the star of
the movie with Angelo.

12:02.583 --> 12:05.000
- Wow.
- Yeah.

12:06.375 --> 12:08.208
- Ready? Let's do it.
- Yeah.

12:10.834 --> 12:14.709
[actors speaking Italian]

12:22.834 --> 12:24.291
Are you OK?

12:24.291 --> 12:26.500
Come on, let's
get out of here. OK?

12:26.500 --> 12:28.750
You stay.
You watch the film.

12:28.750 --> 12:30.291
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

12:53.792 --> 12:54.875
[chattering]

12:54.875 --> 12:56.625
Why was she
crying like that?

12:56.625 --> 12:59.417
I don't know, Nic.
Maybe she thought
the movie sucked.

12:59.417 --> 13:01.125
Why is her arm in a sling?

13:01.125 --> 13:03.208
- Was she in an accident?
- Come on, you...

13:03.208 --> 13:05.333
- Angelo was in an accident.
- Cut it out.

13:05.333 --> 13:08.083
In Naples.
What was he doing in Naples

13:08.083 --> 13:10.291
when he was supposed
to catch a plane in Rome

13:10.291 --> 13:13.542
- to come home to see me?
- Whatever is in
your head is nonsense

13:13.542 --> 13:16.375
- so let it go.
- What if there is
something, a secret?

13:16.375 --> 13:19.125
- How could I walk away
and ignore that?
- How?

13:19.125 --> 13:22.625
I wish I didn't know
all of Deena's secrets
or about Richard.

13:22.625 --> 13:26.500
I would never have slept
with Suzanne, I'd still
have my job, wife, family.

13:26.500 --> 13:30.792
I am telling you
that Angelo loved you
and Deena loved me.

13:30.792 --> 13:33.792
And, now, I wish to God
I would've been happy
with that.

13:37.959 --> 13:42.917
So, Sven, what else
do you do besides coffee?

13:43.917 --> 13:45.333
What do you mean?

13:45.333 --> 13:47.542
I mean, most people
have a dream,

13:47.542 --> 13:50.750
something else
they'd like to...

13:50.750 --> 13:53.792
Oh, yeah. Not me.

13:53.792 --> 13:55.875
No, I really like
being a barista.

13:55.875 --> 13:58.500
- More time for surfing.
- Right.

14:01.542 --> 14:03.000
You are super hot.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.542
- Thanks.
- Deena?

14:04.542 --> 14:07.000
Hey. Hey, T.K.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.667
What... What are you
doing here?

14:09.667 --> 14:12.375
I'm having a drink
with some colleagues.

14:12.375 --> 14:13.834
What are you doing?

14:13.834 --> 14:17.333
This is, um...
my friend... Sven.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.417
- What's up, dude?
- Hey. T.K. How are you?

14:20.417 --> 14:22.208
- I'm gonna hit the john.
- OK.

14:30.083 --> 14:33.208
So are you
on a date with him?

14:33.208 --> 14:34.583
I mean, not a real date.

14:34.583 --> 14:39.250
- I'm just, um...
practicing.
- Hmm. Practicing what?

14:39.250 --> 14:42.333
How to have
a conversation with
someone who's brain-dead.

14:42.333 --> 14:46.542
Well, look, if you need
any practice with
insecure rich guys...

14:46.542 --> 14:48.792
- Do you know any?
- I know one.

14:48.792 --> 14:51.375
He's available
tomorrow night, if you are.

14:53.375 --> 14:56.166
I can't.
I can't two nights
in a row. My kids.

14:56.166 --> 14:58.208
I just...
How about this weekend?

14:59.333 --> 15:01.667
I got to go to Australia
for a few weeks.

15:01.667 --> 15:03.041
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:03.041 --> 15:06.125
Well, look, maybe I'll run
into you again sometime.

15:09.375 --> 15:11.083
I'll work something out.

15:11.083 --> 15:13.083
- You sure?
- Yeah.

15:13.083 --> 15:15.083
- OK.
- OK.

15:15.083 --> 15:16.417
I'll call you.

15:26.041 --> 15:27.959
- You look better today.
- [laughs]

15:27.959 --> 15:30.917
- Yeah, I got
a full night's sleep.
- Heather didn't work?

15:30.917 --> 15:34.417
Oh, no. She worked,
and she slept on the couch.

15:35.083 --> 15:36.959
- Uh-oh.
- Yeah.

15:38.750 --> 15:41.917
Listen... Adam...

15:42.709 --> 15:44.333
Um...

15:46.417 --> 15:50.083
If a friend knows something,
something important,

15:50.083 --> 15:54.291
about another friend,
should the friend
tell the other friend,

15:54.291 --> 15:57.208
even if it might
cost them the friendship?

15:57.208 --> 16:00.458
If a friend has a friend,
and that friend is me,

16:00.458 --> 16:02.709
then yes, you should
tell them everything.

16:02.709 --> 16:05.000
All right. Um...

16:05.000 --> 16:07.667
I ran a record check...

16:08.750 --> 16:10.291
- ...on Heather.
- What?

16:10.291 --> 16:13.917
I was at the courthouse
and I... I just did it.

16:13.917 --> 16:17.166
After hearing what you said
about not knowing her...

16:17.166 --> 16:20.750
Look, I wouldn't even
have brought it up, but...

16:22.625 --> 16:24.583
...there's something on it.

16:27.083 --> 16:29.959
- I asked Ivy
what I should do...
- You showed Ivy?

16:29.959 --> 16:31.667
No. I asked her
if I should tell you.

16:33.875 --> 16:36.625
Well, I don't want it.
And I won't read it.

16:36.625 --> 16:39.458
Heather might be the mother
of your children someday.

16:39.458 --> 16:41.542
- You should know.
- How about I ask her?

16:41.542 --> 16:44.166
- What if she lies?
- You're pissing me off,
Jimmy.

16:44.166 --> 16:47.375
Look, well,
throw it away, then.
But it's yours now.

16:49.125 --> 16:50.667
I did what I thought
was right.

17:04.500 --> 17:07.333
- I like this one,
the apple spice.
- Figured you would.

17:07.333 --> 17:08.917
I like the chocolate.

17:08.917 --> 17:11.583
Dave, you think
it would be weird
if I invited my dad?

17:11.583 --> 17:13.959
- I met his wife,
she seems really cool.
- Yeah.

17:13.959 --> 17:18.500
Are you guys having
a church wedding
or a civil ceremony?

17:18.500 --> 17:20.667
- No, we're not...
- We're not the couple.

17:20.667 --> 17:22.875
It's for a buddy of ours,
just got married.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.875
Whatever you guys say.

17:26.208 --> 17:28.959
- I don't think he believed us.
- You're not helping.

17:28.959 --> 17:31.875
- [cell phone rings]
- That's probably
Hanson from work.

17:34.291 --> 17:35.875
It's the school.

17:36.959 --> 17:38.000
Hello?

17:39.083 --> 17:42.750
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm Larissa's father.

17:42.750 --> 17:46.166
- Yeah, I'll be right there.
- [phone beeps off]

17:46.166 --> 17:47.750
Everything OK?

17:47.750 --> 17:49.667
Larissa
got into a fistfight.

17:50.875 --> 17:52.750
They're suspending her
from school.

17:56.417 --> 18:00.417
Larissa? Can you tell
your mommy and daddy
what happened at recess?

18:01.542 --> 18:05.000
I punched Connor Carter
in the face.

18:05.792 --> 18:07.625
You punched a boy?

18:07.625 --> 18:11.458
Yes. And he has
some pretty serious
bruising and swelling.

18:11.458 --> 18:14.417
Oh, honey, why would you
do something like that?

18:14.417 --> 18:17.709
Because he said
I didn't have a daddy.

18:19.250 --> 18:21.542
Honey, that is
just not true.

18:21.542 --> 18:24.417
I know. That's
why I punched him.

18:24.417 --> 18:28.375
It's important for you both
to spend as much time
as you can with the girls.

18:28.375 --> 18:30.875
We do. We spend
a lot of quality time.

18:30.875 --> 18:34.041
- I got them on the weekends.
- And I'm with them
on weeknights.

18:34.041 --> 18:38.083
Except when she goes
for her dates.
That's when we have Maria.

18:38.083 --> 18:39.792
Her dates?

18:39.792 --> 18:43.000
Well, last night
was her practice one,

18:43.000 --> 18:45.125
but tonight's
her real one.

18:45.125 --> 18:49.000
She picked out
a beautiful dress.
I helped her.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.333
That's sweet, honey.

18:59.709 --> 19:02.291
[Dave] I asked if you could
switch days, you said no,

19:02.291 --> 19:04.792
you didn't want the girls
with the nanny again.

19:04.792 --> 19:06.875
You go on two dates
in a row. What's that?

19:06.875 --> 19:09.709
I didn't plan on getting
asked out. It just happened.

19:09.709 --> 19:12.959
Well, did you ever hear
of the word "no," Deen?
How about that?

19:12.959 --> 19:16.917
Are you mad the girls
are with a sitter or
the fact I had two dates?

19:16.917 --> 19:18.750
I don't care
if you have 100 dates.

19:18.750 --> 19:21.041
I don't care if there's
a line around the street.

19:21.041 --> 19:22.583
Do it on the weekends.

19:22.583 --> 19:25.792
The weekdays you're supposed
to be here with your daughters,

19:25.792 --> 19:28.625
and you're not here.
You're out on
some weird date

19:28.625 --> 19:30.500
when your daughters
need you.

19:30.500 --> 19:33.959
- Wow, I really
hate you sometimes.
- Guess what? I hate you back.

19:33.959 --> 19:36.625
- I've given my life
to these girls.
- Here we go.

19:36.625 --> 19:39.000
I have been here
for every nightmare

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
and every earache
and every tantrum

19:41.000 --> 19:43.166
while you were out
making video games!

19:43.166 --> 19:45.333
- Which is my job!
- Since they were babies!

19:45.333 --> 19:47.834
Don't you dare tell me
I am neglecting my children

19:47.834 --> 19:51.375
- because I take one night...
- One night? It was two nights!

19:51.375 --> 19:53.709
Two nights, Dave,
to do something for me!

19:59.959 --> 20:01.625
Girls, go to your room.

20:13.375 --> 20:15.583
[sighs]

20:15.583 --> 20:17.458
Of course
you're not a bad mother.

20:19.542 --> 20:21.709
- You're the best mother.
- No, I'm not.

20:23.667 --> 20:25.041
I'm a bad mother.

20:27.041 --> 20:30.125
I feel so guilty
because sometimes
I got mad, you know,

20:30.125 --> 20:32.667
'cause I missed out
on things...

20:32.667 --> 20:35.917
...because
I've been doing babies
for the last six years.

20:35.917 --> 20:38.083
It's natural
to feel that way.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.917
You know, when that
teacher called,

20:42.917 --> 20:46.875
I was making four dozen cupcakes
for another kid's birthday.

20:48.458 --> 20:51.917
Honey. Please don't cry.

20:51.917 --> 20:54.917
- And I don't hate you.
- I don't hate you either.

20:57.875 --> 21:00.542
Did you hear that, girls?
I don't hate your mother.

21:02.875 --> 21:04.750
[forlorn chuckle]

21:04.750 --> 21:06.917
What the hell
are we going to do?

21:09.375 --> 21:11.583
Wow! Nice car.

21:11.583 --> 21:13.750
- Everyone's talking about it.
- Thanks.

21:13.750 --> 21:15.834
- How does it drive?
- Good.

21:17.500 --> 21:21.375
- Are you mad at me?
- No.

21:21.375 --> 21:23.458
Why are you giving me
the cold shoulder?

21:23.458 --> 21:25.583
Why didn't you tell me
you had a boyfriend?

21:25.583 --> 21:28.417
Before the Elizadé house,
the bedroom and champagne?

21:28.417 --> 21:30.417
Didn't want to
jeopardize the sale?

21:30.417 --> 21:33.333
No, no. It had nothing
to do with that.

21:34.667 --> 21:36.125
Why am I even
telling you this?

21:37.125 --> 21:40.208
You know what? You're me.

21:40.208 --> 21:43.792
You're me in a dress.
You yank people around.

21:43.792 --> 21:47.917
"I like you, I don't like you,
come closer, go away.
I'm seeing someone."

21:49.208 --> 21:51.625
I've been doing that
for years.

21:51.625 --> 21:54.709
And I finally see why
all the girls I've dated
hate me so much.

21:56.125 --> 21:57.542
I'm a real jerk.

22:02.083 --> 22:05.917
[Nicole] Hello, is there
someone who speaks English?

22:05.917 --> 22:11.000
Uh, I'm calling from
the Cliffwood Insurance
Company in the U.S.

22:12.333 --> 22:14.583
Thank you.

22:14.583 --> 22:17.125
Yes, I'm calling regarding
a fatal accident

22:17.125 --> 22:19.375
that occurred on November 4

22:19.375 --> 22:21.166
in one of your rental cars.

22:21.166 --> 22:23.083
We got all the records
back in Italian

22:23.083 --> 22:25.333
and I can't
decipher them all.

22:25.333 --> 22:28.875
The victim's name
is Varzi.

22:28.875 --> 22:31.542
R-Z, yes. Thank you.

22:33.333 --> 22:35.792
And there was
a passenger in the car?

22:38.834 --> 22:40.375
There was.

22:43.834 --> 22:46.834
Valeria Giacho.

22:49.500 --> 22:51.959
Grazie mille.

23:10.834 --> 23:12.875
[sobs]

23:26.083 --> 23:28.166
I got the Evite
for your party.

23:28.166 --> 23:29.875
That was a mistake.

23:32.417 --> 23:34.375
Look, I don't want
to yank you around.

23:34.375 --> 23:36.834
I don't want to be
that girl.

23:36.834 --> 23:39.208
You said
we could be friends.

23:39.208 --> 23:42.291
I'll tell you something,
I can really use
a friend tonight.

23:42.291 --> 23:45.417
- What happened?
- Oh, God, I don't know.

23:45.417 --> 23:49.083
And that guy, he's just
not always so nice.

23:49.083 --> 23:50.583
Well, then, he's an idiot.

23:51.667 --> 23:53.208
So am I.

23:55.041 --> 23:58.417
[sighs]
You want to get a drink?

24:01.375 --> 24:03.041
Are you buying?

24:05.542 --> 24:07.917
- Yeah.
- Sure. Let's go.

24:07.917 --> 24:11.250
And when we get good
and drunk you'll call
that guy and dump him.

24:11.250 --> 24:12.583
You got it.

24:27.125 --> 24:28.959
"I'm sorry.
This is our house,

24:28.959 --> 24:32.834
so I got us a cleaning lady.
Love, your husband."

25:05.083 --> 25:07.625
[♪ Tom Petty
and the Heartbreakers:
Breakdown ]

25:07.625 --> 25:08.959
You want it?

25:10.959 --> 25:14.000
I think you've proven
you've drinking me
under the table.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.834
I come by it naturally.
My father is a very charming,

25:16.834 --> 25:20.208

who I could never
count on, so...

25:20.208 --> 25:23.166
So we have

25:24.542 --> 25:25.750
Yes.

25:28.083 --> 25:30.333
You have a dog bed.

25:30.333 --> 25:32.875
But no dog.
I had a dog for a while,

25:32.875 --> 25:34.959
but... Car Girl took him.

25:34.959 --> 25:37.291
It was very
Kramer vs. Kramer.

25:37.291 --> 25:39.291
Did you just say
Car Girl?

25:39.291 --> 25:42.458
She's, um...
a girlfriend I had.

25:44.250 --> 25:46.875
So what would that make me,
Real Estate Girl?

25:46.875 --> 25:48.917
Actually,
you don't have a name.

25:48.917 --> 25:51.041
I mean,
it's Bridget, but...

25:51.041 --> 25:54.458
...we only name girls
who we know we don't
really like.

25:55.667 --> 25:57.875
Why do you like me?

25:57.875 --> 26:00.041
I'm so mean.

26:06.208 --> 26:08.875
You're mean
because you don't want
people to know

26:08.875 --> 26:11.208
you're all soft and
vulnerable underneath.

26:12.875 --> 26:14.291
And that's very sexy.

26:15.709 --> 26:17.792
- I gotta go home.
- You can't drive home.

26:17.792 --> 26:19.875
- Drive me home.
- I'll drive you home

26:19.875 --> 26:22.000
if you call on-and-off guy
and break up.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.083
- You call on-and-off guy.
- His number?

26:24.083 --> 26:27.583
Don't call him. It's too late.
I promise I'll do it tomorrow.

26:30.542 --> 26:33.000
Tonight I want to do
something to piss him off.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.333
What's that?

26:36.000 --> 26:37.250

Why didn't you wake me up
last night?

27:42.500 --> 27:45.500
- I had some reading to do.
- Oh, yeah? For school?

27:46.500 --> 27:47.875
No.

27:52.667 --> 27:54.500
If you wanted to know
about my past,

27:54.500 --> 27:56.375
all you had to do was ask.

27:56.375 --> 27:58.125
Jimmy did that.

27:59.333 --> 28:01.625
I didn't read it.

28:01.625 --> 28:04.834
- I don't want to know
what's in it.
- I'll tell you what's in it.

28:04.834 --> 28:08.458
I was arrested twice,
for cocaine possession.

28:10.041 --> 28:12.500
The second time I went
to jail for three months.

28:12.500 --> 28:16.125
- Why wouldn't you tell me that?
- Didn't put it
on the questionnaire.

28:16.125 --> 28:19.291
"You have a criminal record?"
I never would've
thought of that.

28:19.291 --> 28:23.709
- Why'd you do the check?
- This is about keeping
secrets from me.

28:23.709 --> 28:27.542
I don't want the girls
down at the strip club
knowing more about you.

28:27.542 --> 28:29.667
I don't care about them.

28:29.667 --> 28:32.917
I don't care if
I never see them again.

28:34.166 --> 28:35.375
But you...

28:37.625 --> 28:39.709
You don't want me to leave.

28:39.709 --> 28:43.875
I keep trying to tell myself
that this is great
as long as it lasts,

28:43.875 --> 28:47.250
and... if it ends,
I'll get back on my feet.

28:48.542 --> 28:52.375
- But I don't know if I will.
- Hey, come on.

28:55.709 --> 28:59.709
I'm here. I love you.

28:59.709 --> 29:04.166
And as far as security
goes, there is none.

29:04.166 --> 29:06.834
Dave and Deena ruined
their whole marriage

29:06.834 --> 29:10.083
because they kept
too many secrets. I don't
want to make that mistake.

29:11.750 --> 29:14.125
I was also arrested
another time.

29:16.083 --> 29:18.000
For shoplifting
when I was 16.

29:19.250 --> 29:22.458
- [Summer laughs]
- Well...

29:22.458 --> 29:26.417
...I stole a hot dog off
of old man Beeman's barbecue
in the fifth grade.

29:26.417 --> 29:28.667
I don't know if
I can live with that.

29:29.667 --> 29:31.000

29:47.250 --> 29:49.250
It is you, right?

29:49.250 --> 29:50.709
Angelo's Nicole?

29:53.625 --> 29:56.583
Angelo talked about you
all the time.

29:56.583 --> 29:58.417
He couldn't wait
to see the baby.

29:58.417 --> 30:00.250
He wanted to raise it
in Rome.

30:00.250 --> 30:04.083
He kept asking my advice
on how to convince you
to move to Italy.

30:06.250 --> 30:08.917
He was a very...

30:08.917 --> 30:10.959
...very Italian man.

30:13.041 --> 30:15.125
Is that your way
of telling me that...

30:16.291 --> 30:18.041
...he was having
an affair with you?

30:23.500 --> 30:26.959
I know that you were
in the car with him
when the accident happened.

30:28.291 --> 30:30.667
I wasn't with him
when he died.

30:31.625 --> 30:33.375
We were both unconscious.

30:34.500 --> 30:35.959
He died in the hospital.

30:35.959 --> 30:39.375
So were you having
an affair with him?

30:39.375 --> 30:41.125
It wasn't an affair.

30:41.125 --> 30:44.834
It was...
a moment, that's all.

30:46.083 --> 30:47.834
Angelo wanted you.

30:47.834 --> 30:51.333
You meant more to him
than I ever could.

30:51.333 --> 30:54.291
I don't care about that.
I just want to know
the truth.

30:54.291 --> 30:55.834
That is the truth.

30:57.834 --> 31:00.875
I hate this.

31:00.875 --> 31:04.542
I hate that he's gone,
I hate that he lied to me.

31:04.542 --> 31:06.542
That something like this
could happen

31:06.542 --> 31:09.542
and we just have to go on
with our stupid little lives.

31:10.208 --> 31:12.792
But he was here.

inside you.

A baby, ready to come out
and grow up

31:19.709 --> 31:22.875

and fall in love.

for Australia.

32:05.750 --> 32:08.458
I'm supposed
to be on a date,
but you canceled it.

32:08.458 --> 32:10.709
I'm sorry. I just had
to be with my girls.

32:10.709 --> 32:12.792
- It's OK, I get it.
- Yeah.

32:12.792 --> 32:14.333
I didn't want
to interrupt.

32:14.333 --> 32:17.834
I didn't want to be
gone for so long
without giving you this.

- You shouldn't have.
- Come on, open it up.

your practice dates.

So can I come in
for a minute?

I want to ask you in.
It's just that my husband, uh...

32:54.583 --> 32:58.625
- Ex... is in there.
- Right.

33:00.291 --> 33:03.041
I'm sorry I had to cancel
our date. I didn't want to.

I wanted to go on.

39:47.500 --> 39:49.792
- It'll be too late.
- If that's what he wants,

39:49.792 --> 39:51.792
I'll support him
every step of the way.

39:52.834 --> 39:53.875
Cool.

40:14.041 --> 40:18.083
[sirens in distance]

40:18.083 --> 40:20.083
Hey.

40:20.083 --> 40:22.125
I don't even know
what to say to you.

40:24.458 --> 40:28.125
- All the lies you told me.
- I never told you a lie.

40:28.125 --> 40:31.542
I told you that I was
seeing someone off and on.

40:31.542 --> 40:33.333
And that's him?

40:33.333 --> 40:35.917
Brian, I haven't...

40:35.917 --> 40:39.417
...been with him
in almost three months.

40:39.417 --> 40:43.166
And the other day,
before the staff meeting,
he scolded me about you.

40:43.166 --> 40:45.083
He told me
to stay away from you.

40:45.083 --> 40:49.125
- And so you did what he said?
- I didn't know what else to do!

40:49.125 --> 40:51.750
I thought that if you knew
about me and your father

40:51.750 --> 40:55.125
that you would never see me
in a romantic way again.

40:55.125 --> 40:56.792
You're right, I won't.

40:59.250 --> 41:01.959
[sighs] Brian...

41:03.917 --> 41:08.041
...all that, um...
All that "just friends"
stuff?

41:10.125 --> 41:11.750
That was all an act.

41:14.125 --> 41:16.834
I wish, more than anything
in the whole wide world,

41:16.834 --> 41:20.375
that I would have
never gotten involved
with your father.

41:20.375 --> 41:22.959
And it's not
because he's my boss,

41:22.959 --> 41:26.917
and it's not because...
he's married

41:26.917 --> 41:29.834
or because he's
30 years older than me.

41:31.375 --> 41:33.291
It's because of you.

41:33.291 --> 41:36.959
Because the first time
that I ever
laid eyes on you,

41:36.959 --> 41:38.625
I thought...

41:39.583 --> 41:41.333
"Oh, no.

41:42.834 --> 41:45.750
This is a guy I could
fall in love with."

41:45.750 --> 41:47.875
And I know that there is
no hope for us.

41:47.875 --> 41:49.208
I get it.

41:49.208 --> 41:51.333
But I just
wanted you to know.

41:54.041 --> 41:55.667
It was real.

41:55.667 --> 41:58.166
