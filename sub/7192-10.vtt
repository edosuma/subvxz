00:03.211 --> 00:04.671
- Are you okay?

00:04.754 --> 00:05.630
- Yeah.

00:05.714 --> 00:07.757
It's all just kind
of rushing kind of fast.

00:13.346 --> 00:14.264
- What's wrong?

00:14.347 --> 00:15.849
- I just remembered everything.

00:15.932 --> 00:17.100
- That's great!

00:17.183 --> 00:18.226
- I remembered how
I ended up in my other life.

00:20.895 --> 00:22.147
You chose Jax over me.

00:23.690 --> 00:24.149
I was gonna walk you home.

00:26.234 --> 00:27.527
I reached out and I thought

00:27.610 --> 00:30.113
you were gonna to take my hand
but you took Jax's.

00:30.196 --> 00:31.239
And then all of a sudden
I was just...

00:31.322 --> 00:32.490
Bam!

00:32.573 --> 00:34.534
In the Everglades.

00:34.617 --> 00:36.953
- That's not exactly
how it happened!

00:37.036 --> 00:39.998
I waited a long time before
I took Jax's hand.

00:40.081 --> 00:41.124
- Why?

00:41.207 --> 00:42.542
Why did you pick him?

{\an8}- Why did you pick Jax over me?

01:16.743 --> 01:17.786
{\an8}Is it because he's a wizard

01:17.869 --> 01:18.995
{\an8}and I'm just a human?

01:19.078 --> 01:22.081
{\an8}- Would it make it
easier if I said yes?

01:22.165 --> 01:24.042
{\an8}- I don't know.

01:24.125 --> 01:27.212
I just want a reason
so I can understand.

01:27.295 --> 01:29.005
- There isn't a reason.

01:29.088 --> 01:30.465
Nothing I can put into words.

01:30.548 --> 01:32.342
It was just...

01:32.425 --> 01:33.510
a feeling.

01:33.593 --> 01:35.053
- That you want to be
with him and not me.

01:37.430 --> 01:39.015
- I care about both of you.

01:39.098 --> 01:40.225
- You just care for him more.

01:41.684 --> 01:42.769
- Yes.

01:42.852 --> 01:45.772
- Emma, why did you
do this to me?

01:45.855 --> 01:47.857
- I didn't know picking
Jax would send you away!

01:47.941 --> 01:48.775
- Not that.

01:48.858 --> 01:51.528
Why did you bring me here?

01:51.611 --> 01:54.322
Why couldn't you just
leave me in the Everglades?

01:54.405 --> 01:55.532
-Because this is your life!

01:55.615 --> 01:57.617
- So was that.

01:57.700 --> 01:58.743
I was happy.

01:58.827 --> 02:00.411
I had everything I wanted.

02:00.495 --> 02:01.621
Now it's gone
and I have nothing.

02:01.704 --> 02:04.249
- That's not true.

02:04.332 --> 02:06.626
You've got your life back,
your family, your friends...

02:06.709 --> 02:09.336
- I don't have you.

02:09.419 --> 02:10.338
I don't have Mia.

02:10.420 --> 02:12.257
I don't even have Billy.

02:12.340 --> 02:14.384
You've got to bring
back Billy at least.

02:14.467 --> 02:15.385
- I can't.

02:15.468 --> 02:16.135
He's not a part of this life.

02:16.219 --> 02:18.137
- But he was a part of my life!

02:19.180 --> 02:20.557
I've had him for ten years.

02:20.640 --> 02:21.808
Ever since he was a baby.

02:22.517 --> 02:23.726
He's never lived in the wild.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.562
He wouldn't survive out there.

02:25.645 --> 02:27.480
- There's nothing I can do.
I'm sorry.

02:27.564 --> 02:27.939
- I know.

02:28.022 --> 02:29.566
You're sorry.

02:31.484 --> 02:32.777
I think you should go now.

02:32.861 --> 02:34.779
- Daniel, come on.
- Emma, please.

02:46.165 --> 02:48.126
- MissInformation here
at the Seven,

02:48.209 --> 02:51.004
serving Miami's
finest French fries!

02:51.087 --> 02:53.756
Where a huge party is in
the works for Daniel Miller.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.216
Let's get the scoop.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.301
So, Diego.

02:56.384 --> 02:58.636
I see you're having
a party for Daniel.

02:58.720 --> 03:02.098
MissInformed minds
want to know, where's he been?

03:02.181 --> 03:04.475
- Um...

03:04.559 --> 03:05.935
Fort Lauderdale!

03:06.019 --> 03:08.605
Yeah, he had to go there to...

03:08.688 --> 03:10.815
- To--to pick up
some, some...

03:10.899 --> 03:12.692
- Stuff...

03:12.775 --> 03:14.611
- For his dad.

03:14.694 --> 03:16.779
- And now he's back!

03:17.947 --> 03:19.449
- So Daniel went
to Fort Lauderdale

03:19.532 --> 03:20.450
to pick up some "stuff"

03:20.533 --> 03:22.619
and you're having a party
because he's back?

03:22.702 --> 03:24.829
- Yeah.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.497
- Don't you throw parties
for your friends

03:26.581 --> 03:27.790
when they go away
and come back?

03:27.874 --> 03:29.500
- Not when they only
go 30 miles away.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.128
- Some friend you are.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.381
- Even I can't make
a blog post out of that.

03:36.841 --> 03:38.801
- Put-- Put that...

03:38.885 --> 03:40.345
- We nailed that one.
- Totally.

03:41.763 --> 03:42.972
DIEGO: Wait...

03:43.056 --> 03:44.474
Where's our guest of honor?

03:44.557 --> 03:45.016
And Emma.

03:45.099 --> 03:46.976
And Andi.
And Jax?

03:47.060 --> 03:49.354
- You texted them all, right?

03:49.437 --> 03:50.730
- Yeah, but I'll
text them again.

03:50.813 --> 03:51.397
(phones beeping)

03:55.610 --> 03:56.527
(phone chirps)

03:59.072 --> 03:59.238
- (scoffs)

04:01.741 --> 04:03.076
Yeah, right!

04:05.495 --> 04:07.288
- This may sound silly
but bring back Billy.

04:09.832 --> 04:10.667
What?

04:10.750 --> 04:13.002
(goat baaing)

04:13.086 --> 04:13.252
Billy goat.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.339
From Zanzibar to West Samoa

04:16.422 --> 04:17.839
bring back
that seven foot boa.

04:19.007 --> 04:23.012
Not feather boa, real boa!

04:23.096 --> 04:24.180
Daniel's boa!

04:25.390 --> 04:26.391
This isn't a game!

04:27.892 --> 04:30.395
Who am I talking to?

04:30.478 --> 04:31.396
I'm driving myself
crazy with this!

04:34.107 --> 04:35.733
Daniel feels the loss
and his heart aches

04:35.817 --> 04:36.943
at least bring
back the snake.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.363
What in the...

04:40.446 --> 04:43.074
(doorbell rings)

04:43.157 --> 04:45.034
Ahh!

04:45.118 --> 04:46.035
No.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.078
Ba-a-aad goat.

04:47.161 --> 04:48.371
(goat baaing)

04:56.421 --> 04:57.714
- I came as soon as you called.

04:57.797 --> 04:58.673
(sniffing)

04:58.756 --> 05:01.384
Why does it smell like
a barn in here?

05:01.467 --> 05:02.510
- Goat.

05:02.593 --> 05:03.511
B--Billy goat.

05:03.594 --> 05:04.554
Wearing a feather boa.

05:04.637 --> 05:06.097
Ate the mail.

05:06.180 --> 05:07.265
Hope nothing important.

05:07.348 --> 05:08.433
- Okay, take a deep breath.

05:13.062 --> 05:14.647
- I'm trying to bring back
Daniel's snake,

05:14.731 --> 05:16.399
but I can't figure out how.

05:16.482 --> 05:17.275
- You know why you can't.

05:17.358 --> 05:19.193
Because he's from
Daniel's other life.

05:19.277 --> 05:22.322
- But you should have
seen his face, Lily!

05:22.405 --> 05:23.322
Please, you have to help me!

05:23.406 --> 05:24.907
- Emma, we warned you
of the consequences

05:24.991 --> 05:27.201
of the Continuum Break.

05:27.285 --> 05:29.954
And now that it's done,
you have to live with them.

05:30.038 --> 05:32.373
- I shouldn't have done it!

05:32.457 --> 05:33.666
Why did I tell
him about the Break?

05:33.750 --> 05:34.709
He was happy!

05:34.792 --> 05:35.918
And now...

05:36.002 --> 05:38.713
I have to bring Billy back.

05:38.796 --> 05:40.757
If I can get Billy back,
he won't feel

05:40.840 --> 05:43.176
so alone and he'll
forgive me and not hate me!

05:48.681 --> 05:49.223
- (screaming)

05:49.307 --> 05:50.850
Jax!
What are you--

05:50.933 --> 05:52.643
Oh!

05:52.727 --> 05:54.187
My white sofa!

05:54.270 --> 05:56.189
- How did you get involved
with my mother?

05:56.272 --> 05:57.315
- Oh, no.

05:57.398 --> 05:59.317
You cannot just transport
in here, and--

05:59.400 --> 06:04.113
and make me spill my tea
and then demand answers!

06:04.197 --> 06:05.364
Would you mind doing a...

06:06.324 --> 06:08.576
... to lift that stain, please?

06:08.659 --> 06:10.411
- Not until you answer
my questions.

06:10.870 --> 06:13.122
- All right.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.917
She came to us, okay?

06:16.000 --> 06:17.627
She thought Jessie
might be in danger

06:17.710 --> 06:19.545
and she wanted us
to help her.

06:19.629 --> 06:24.258
- She didn't even know my father
was a wizard until the very end.

06:24.342 --> 06:26.260
And how would she know anything
about the Van Pelt coven?

06:26.344 --> 06:28.805
And that you would
even help her?

06:28.888 --> 06:32.475
- Hey, our family name
happens to be very important

06:32.558 --> 06:33.643
in the magical realm!

06:35.353 --> 06:35.978
Oh, whatever little wizard boy.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.731
Someone must've told her.

06:38.815 --> 06:39.607
Now would you mind?

06:40.650 --> 06:42.527
Actually, a brand new cushion
might be better.

06:49.075 --> 06:51.452
There, thank you.

06:52.328 --> 06:52.495
Was that so hard?

06:55.581 --> 07:01.170
Ahh!

07:01.170 --> 07:03.089
- No, you let me hide first,

07:03.172 --> 07:05.591
then you try and find me!

07:05.675 --> 07:07.009
Weren't you, like,
friends with a game book

07:07.093 --> 07:08.511
that taught you these things?

07:08.594 --> 07:09.637
(doorbell)

07:09.720 --> 07:12.390
<i>DISTORTED VOICE: Delivery</i>
<i>for Mr. Novoa!</i>

07:12.473 --> 07:14.517
- You hide first, now!

07:14.600 --> 07:15.518
Then I'll come and find you.

07:20.648 --> 07:22.066
- (distorted) Gotcha.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.860
- What are you doing here?

07:23.943 --> 07:25.570
- Getting the Hex back.

07:25.653 --> 07:26.863
- The what?

07:26.946 --> 07:29.031
- Don't even try with me,
booknapper!

07:29.115 --> 07:29.740
- I'm getting my father!

07:29.824 --> 07:32.201
- Go ahead.
- Oh, Father!

07:32.285 --> 07:34.996
We have... an intruder!

07:35.079 --> 07:35.705
(banging)

07:35.788 --> 07:37.540
- That was definitely Hexie!

07:37.623 --> 07:38.708
Where are you, Hexie?

07:40.001 --> 07:40.835
- Wait!
You can't come in here.

07:40.918 --> 07:43.045
You don't have a...
search warrant!

07:44.630 --> 07:46.716
(banging)

07:46.799 --> 07:47.550
No! You can't
go in there.

07:47.633 --> 07:48.801
My dad keeps
his dragons in there!

07:48.885 --> 07:51.512
- Really?

07:51.596 --> 07:52.597
Awesome!

07:52.680 --> 07:53.639
(banging)

07:57.268 --> 07:58.978
- It's not what it looks like.

07:59.061 --> 08:00.354
We were playing.

08:00.438 --> 08:01.981
- Is this true, Hexie?

08:03.107 --> 08:04.358
- We were hanging out.

08:04.442 --> 08:06.861
He even let me read him.
Right?

08:08.529 --> 08:10.114
I even learned some new spells.

08:10.198 --> 08:11.407
Check them out.

08:11.490 --> 08:12.909
Andi pushed her way
into my house,

08:12.992 --> 08:14.535
let's see how she
likes being a mouse.

08:16.287 --> 08:16.871
- (high pitched)
Nice try.

08:16.954 --> 08:18.789
Oh, no!

08:18.873 --> 08:20.041
What happened to my voice?

08:20.124 --> 08:21.042
- It worked!

08:21.125 --> 08:22.251
Kind of!

08:22.335 --> 08:23.252
- No.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.378
Not at all.

08:28.966 --> 08:29.842
- Bye, Hex!

08:29.926 --> 08:31.761
See you soon.

08:31.844 --> 08:33.511
- Sympathizing with
your booknapper?

08:33.596 --> 08:35.097
What'd she do,
pagewash you?

08:37.515 --> 08:38.392
- Andi?

08:38.476 --> 08:39.809
You hanging out with my
sister again?

08:39.894 --> 08:41.938
- No, I had to
liberate the Hex

08:42.020 --> 08:44.357
from her scheming
little paws.

08:44.440 --> 08:44.899
By the way,
Emma texted me.

08:44.982 --> 08:46.901
Daniel made it!

08:46.984 --> 08:48.236
- I know.

08:48.319 --> 08:50.780
Did she mention that she saved
him with a kiss?

08:50.863 --> 08:51.906
- She did what now?

08:51.989 --> 08:53.574
What--
Details, please!

09:00.373 --> 09:02.416
- And at the last second
literally,

09:02.500 --> 09:03.918
it all just came
rushing back to him.

09:04.001 --> 09:05.253
Just like that!

09:05.336 --> 09:06.545
- Just like that, huh.

09:06.629 --> 09:08.130
Nothing to do with
that little lip-lock?

09:08.214 --> 09:10.216
Jax told me about it.

09:10.299 --> 09:11.592
- What else did Jax say?
- Nothing.

09:11.676 --> 09:16.138
Not surprisingly he didn't
want to talk about it.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.474
Emm, thinking back on it now,

09:18.557 --> 09:20.434
do you kinda wish you
would've left Daniel alone?

09:20.518 --> 09:23.354
- What? Why does everybody
keep asking that?

09:23.437 --> 09:24.605
- Everybody like who?

09:24.689 --> 09:26.190
- You...

09:26.274 --> 09:28.150
Daniel...

09:28.234 --> 09:29.610
Okay, mostly just
you and Daniel.

09:29.694 --> 09:30.820
But still!

09:30.903 --> 09:31.404
What did he really lose?

09:31.487 --> 09:33.864
- Umm, his girlfriend?

09:33.948 --> 09:34.991
- But it was Mia!

09:35.074 --> 09:36.200
So it wasn't really a loss.

09:36.284 --> 09:39.620
And I'm sorry about Billy,
but he's got everything else:

09:39.704 --> 09:42.873
his family, his friends,
his awesome life here.

09:42.957 --> 09:45.126
- Emma, Andi,

09:45.209 --> 09:47.962
class starts in 47 seconds!

09:48.045 --> 09:49.922
Chop, chop!

09:50.006 --> 09:51.507
- Speaking of Daniel's family,

09:51.591 --> 09:53.384
did the good T-3, the ones
who rescue animals,

09:53.467 --> 09:54.010
make it back too?

09:54.093 --> 09:56.178
- Oh, Emm.

09:56.262 --> 09:57.305
Forget something?

10:02.518 --> 10:04.145
ANDI: Guess not.

10:06.314 --> 10:07.940
- "Bon Appetit.

10:08.024 --> 10:08.899
The Millers."

10:08.983 --> 10:11.861
Daniel!

10:14.822 --> 10:16.699
- Ahh, just like old times.

10:20.536 --> 10:22.997
- Hmm, too pink.

10:24.206 --> 10:25.416
Too red.

10:27.043 --> 10:28.836
Too pinky-red.

10:30.171 --> 10:30.671
Too reddish-pink.

10:32.965 --> 10:34.342
- Hey, anybody seen Jax?

10:34.425 --> 10:36.344
- No, he didn't show up to swim
practice again this morning.

10:36.427 --> 10:38.721
- He wasn't
in history class.

10:38.804 --> 10:39.347
- Or chemistry.

10:39.430 --> 10:41.390
I love when he says...

10:41.474 --> 10:43.225
(imitating accent)
"H-2-C-O-3"!

10:44.894 --> 10:45.686
EMMA: Daniel!

10:47.063 --> 10:49.023
Daniel, come back!
We need to talk.

10:49.106 --> 10:50.608
- There's nothing
left to talk about.

10:52.276 --> 10:54.070
- Oh, Daniel Miller.

10:54.153 --> 10:55.112
- Mr. Alonso.

10:55.196 --> 10:57.073
Looking...

10:57.156 --> 10:58.366
the same, as always...

10:58.449 --> 11:00.076
- Yes, thanks to you.

11:00.159 --> 11:01.160
In my office.

11:01.243 --> 11:02.411
You know the way.

11:08.125 --> 11:09.293
- Jax!

11:09.377 --> 11:10.419
- What do you want, Emma?

11:10.503 --> 11:12.755
- You weren't at school today.

11:12.838 --> 11:14.715
You haven't been
answering my texts.

11:14.799 --> 11:16.175
Are you feeling okay?

11:16.258 --> 11:16.842
- Really, that's what
you're gonna go with?

11:18.969 --> 11:19.929
Okay, I'll play along.

11:21.680 --> 11:23.891
I think I've come
down with a touch of

11:23.974 --> 11:25.935
my-girlfriend-kissed-
another-guy flu.

11:26.018 --> 11:28.145
- It's not what
it looked like.

11:28.229 --> 11:30.648
Jax, please,
let's talk about this.

11:46.247 --> 11:46.914
- All right.
You've got my attention.

11:46.997 --> 11:48.916
- If you won't let me explain,

11:48.999 --> 11:50.334
you just have to see
for yourself.

11:52.628 --> 11:55.005
Jax must see that
it's all right

11:55.089 --> 11:56.632
Take us back to last night.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.304
- Whoa.

12:02.388 --> 12:05.307
First breaking down my door,
and now you want a time jump?

12:05.391 --> 12:07.143
Giving your powers a bit
of a workout, aren't you?

12:07.226 --> 12:08.644
- Just watch.

12:08.727 --> 12:11.147
Daniel, we were
more than friends.

12:11.230 --> 12:12.481
You were my first love.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.900
I cared about you more than
anything in the world.

12:14.984 --> 12:16.902
- You want me to relive this?

12:16.986 --> 12:17.903
That's just plain mean.

12:17.987 --> 12:18.779
- Just stop talking and watch.

12:24.452 --> 12:27.580
Daniel, what are you doing?

12:29.957 --> 12:31.542
- I thought it might
do the trick!

12:31.625 --> 12:32.835
- No!

12:32.918 --> 12:34.670
I'm sorry,
but I'm with Jax!

12:35.963 --> 12:37.673
See?

12:37.756 --> 12:38.883
- Wow.

12:38.966 --> 12:41.427
Don't I feel like
a grade-A jerk.

12:41.510 --> 12:43.262
- Yeah.

12:43.345 --> 12:45.806
But you're my grade-A jerk.

12:50.436 --> 12:51.729
- I didn't do it!

12:51.812 --> 12:53.063
- As usual.

12:53.147 --> 12:56.275
But this time, you were kind
enough to leave the evidence.

12:56.358 --> 12:57.735
"Bon Appetit, The Millers."

12:57.818 --> 12:59.236
- Why would I sign
my name to a prank?

12:59.320 --> 13:01.697
- Because...

13:01.780 --> 13:03.032
Good question.

13:03.115 --> 13:04.200
I don't know why you kids

13:04.283 --> 13:05.743
do most of the things
you do, but--

13:05.826 --> 13:06.994
(phone beeping)

13:08.162 --> 13:09.330
Yes?

13:09.413 --> 13:10.331
What?

13:10.414 --> 13:12.500
I'll be right there.

13:13.876 --> 13:15.211
I should have called
in sick today.

13:15.294 --> 13:17.796
Library emergency.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.048
Again.

13:19.131 --> 13:20.424
I'm not through with you.

13:20.508 --> 13:20.966
Don't go anywhere.

13:32.686 --> 13:32.937
- Troublemakers.

13:42.988 --> 13:45.616
- Okay, 44 dresses,

13:45.699 --> 13:47.368
65 pairs of shoes...

13:47.451 --> 13:49.328
And one, two, thr--

13:49.411 --> 13:52.164
172 accessories.

13:52.248 --> 13:53.582
Is that enough for two events?

13:53.666 --> 13:55.125
Oh, Maddie!

13:55.209 --> 13:56.669
Good.

13:56.752 --> 13:59.588
I am making the shopping list
for the Van Pelt reunion.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.383
Now, how many accessories
do you think?

14:02.466 --> 14:04.093
More than 172 right?

14:04.176 --> 14:04.843
I knew it.
I know--

14:04.927 --> 14:07.012
- Has it been a year already?

14:07.096 --> 14:08.264
- I know!

14:08.347 --> 14:09.598
I know!

14:09.682 --> 14:11.100
Now, this year,

14:11.183 --> 14:12.810
instead of us being
so matchy-matchy.

14:12.893 --> 14:16.480
I think I'd like us
to be a little more,

14:16.564 --> 14:17.815
"Oh! Look at that.

14:17.898 --> 14:19.567
Their outfits just

14:19.650 --> 14:23.153
randomly complement
each other so perfectly!"

14:23.237 --> 14:26.073
- I think I'm gonna
bring Proxy this year.

14:26.156 --> 14:27.741
It's time the family
got to know him.

14:27.825 --> 14:30.244
- (gasping)
No.

14:30.327 --> 14:32.121
No, Maddie, no, no.

14:32.204 --> 14:33.872
No, that's a bad idea.

14:35.207 --> 14:35.666
- No, it's not.

14:35.749 --> 14:36.458
It's a great idea.

14:36.542 --> 14:38.210
- Oh, Maddie.

14:38.294 --> 14:39.587
You can't.

14:42.881 --> 14:45.426
- Daniel, what are you doing?

14:45.509 --> 14:46.885
- I thought it might
do the trick.

14:47.928 --> 14:49.430
- No!

14:49.513 --> 14:51.265
I'm sorry,
but I'm with Jax!

14:53.934 --> 14:55.227
- Aww, show me again.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.313
- Jax, come on.

14:57.396 --> 14:58.063
It's not nice.

14:58.147 --> 15:00.357
- Oh, you wanted me to see it.

15:00.441 --> 15:01.984
- I didn't mean eight times.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.235
- Oh, please?

15:03.319 --> 15:04.695
Just to the part where
you push him away

15:04.778 --> 15:06.530
and tell him you're with me?

15:06.614 --> 15:08.991
- This is the last time,
then we're leaving.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.495
No!

15:13.579 --> 15:15.080
I'm sorry,
but I'm with Jax!

15:17.499 --> 15:19.835
- Jessie, my dear.

15:19.918 --> 15:22.212
At the next school visit, when
they ask you what you're looking

15:22.296 --> 15:24.340
for in a school,
try not to say "the exit."

15:24.423 --> 15:26.300
- Sorry, Dad.

15:26.383 --> 15:27.509
- (chuckling)

15:27.593 --> 15:28.010
Showed you have
a quick wit, though.

15:30.554 --> 15:31.972
Hm, that's odd.

15:46.737 --> 15:48.614
- Oh, Maddie, you can't.

15:48.697 --> 15:50.157
You just can't.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.368
- Why not?

15:52.451 --> 15:54.244
- Hmm, I don't know,
let me think.

15:54.328 --> 15:56.455
I got it.

15:56.538 --> 15:58.582
His Kanay stench.

15:58.666 --> 16:01.085
He's gonna ruin
everybody's appetite.

16:01.168 --> 16:04.505
And the hors d'oeuvres are
always so delectable!

16:04.588 --> 16:06.423
- So, I'll keep him away
from the food.

16:06.507 --> 16:08.425
No biggie.
- Oh, it's a biggie!

16:08.509 --> 16:11.345
It's a big biggie
you bringing him there!

16:11.428 --> 16:13.681
Revealing to the entire
Van Pelt coven

16:13.764 --> 16:17.101
that my daughter
dates one of them?

16:17.184 --> 16:19.061
- "One of them?"

16:19.144 --> 16:21.188
There are only,
like, two left on Earth!

16:21.271 --> 16:22.231
- Uh, yea!

16:22.314 --> 16:24.149
And you had to end up
with one of them!

16:24.233 --> 16:24.858
- They're gonna find out
eventually!

16:24.942 --> 16:28.112
- Oh, maybe that's not true.

16:28.195 --> 16:28.570
- What's that supposed to mean?

16:28.654 --> 16:31.031
- Maddie Winkie.

16:31.115 --> 16:34.535
I'm okay with this little phase
that you're going through

16:34.618 --> 16:36.495
of dating inappropriate boys
because,

16:36.578 --> 16:39.581
heaven knows I did the same
thing once upon a time...

16:39.665 --> 16:43.335
Anyway, I know that eventually
you'll come around

16:43.419 --> 16:46.004
and start dating
a nice wizard boy.

16:46.088 --> 16:47.673
- Diego is not a "phase."

16:47.756 --> 16:49.299
He's my boyfriend.

16:49.383 --> 16:52.136
And either he comes with me,
or I'm not coming at all.

16:54.263 --> 16:55.264
- Maddie Winkie.

16:56.432 --> 16:57.057
Princess.

16:59.184 --> 17:01.645
Can we come to some
sort of agreement?

17:01.729 --> 17:03.522
A compromise, perhaps?

17:03.605 --> 17:05.648
- Yeah, I don't know
what that could be.

17:12.656 --> 17:14.282
- I'm sorry I ever doubted you,
Emma.

17:14.366 --> 17:15.242
Can you forgive me?

17:15.325 --> 17:18.287
- Well, you'll have
to make it up to me,

17:18.369 --> 17:19.913
but this is a good start.

17:19.997 --> 17:22.040
- Well, thanks for not
giving up on me.

17:22.124 --> 17:25.711
Busting down my door
and risking time jump--

17:26.753 --> 17:27.296
Dad!

17:27.378 --> 17:28.297
- Jax.

17:28.380 --> 17:30.507
Emma.

17:30.591 --> 17:31.633
Where are you
just getting back from?

17:31.717 --> 17:33.969
- Oh, you know, just...

17:34.052 --> 17:36.722
here and there,
everywhere...you know?

17:36.805 --> 17:39.558
- You forgot
to mention "back."

17:39.641 --> 17:41.685
- Back?
- Back in time.

17:41.769 --> 17:43.687
Well, that's where you're
really coming from, right?

17:47.691 --> 17:48.942
- Big news, Proxy!

17:49.026 --> 17:51.069
You know how every year there's
a big Van Pelt Family Reunion?

17:51.153 --> 17:53.655
- You're taking me?
Maddie, that's amazing!

17:53.739 --> 17:54.823
I have so much to do!

17:54.907 --> 17:57.284
I-- I need to get new shoes!
My suit needs pressing.

17:57.367 --> 17:57.951
A haircut.

17:58.035 --> 18:00.204
For me, not, not the suit.

18:00.287 --> 18:00.829
- Let's slow down a little.

18:00.913 --> 18:03.040
- Why does he get to go?

18:03.123 --> 18:05.417
- Yeah.
It was so fun last time!

18:05.501 --> 18:06.627
- The food was amazing.

18:06.710 --> 18:07.961
They had a bottomless
shrimp bowl.

18:08.045 --> 18:09.296
- Oh come on,
all you can eat shrimp?

18:09.379 --> 18:10.631
That doesn't
sound so amazing.

18:10.714 --> 18:12.841
- No, the shrimp bowl
was literally bottomless.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.635
You could see all the way
to the center of the Earth.

18:14.718 --> 18:16.512
And the shrimp
kept shooting out,

18:16.595 --> 18:18.514
cooked by the Earth's
molten core!

18:18.597 --> 18:20.682
I burned my tongue
but it was worth it!

18:20.766 --> 18:22.601
- Maddie, I'd love to go.

18:24.269 --> 18:25.771
This is a big step.

18:25.854 --> 18:27.314
It means that your mom
is finally accepting us

18:27.397 --> 18:29.233
being together despite
our differences.

18:29.316 --> 18:31.193
- Maybe not 100 percent.

18:31.276 --> 18:33.529
- Okay...well, what percent
of us being together

18:33.612 --> 18:34.905
has she finally accepted?

18:34.988 --> 18:37.241
- Somewhere between 75%...

18:38.450 --> 18:39.701
And zero percent.

18:42.454 --> 18:44.706
- I don't get it--so then
why is she letting you take me?

18:44.790 --> 18:45.707
- She's not.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.209
- We still get to go!

18:47.292 --> 18:48.168
Yay!

18:48.252 --> 18:49.545
- Too soon, Sophie.

18:49.628 --> 18:50.712
DIEGO: I don't get it.

18:50.796 --> 18:53.423
You came in here
to tell me about it.

18:53.507 --> 18:55.134
What was the big news?

18:55.217 --> 18:57.302
- That she's willing to let you
make the hors d'oeuvres?

19:02.641 --> 19:03.976
Proxy, come on.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.730
- Time jumps are only to be used
in emergencies, Emma.

19:08.814 --> 19:10.983
You should know that by now.

19:11.066 --> 19:14.027
Abusing them
is a very serious offense.

19:14.111 --> 19:15.863
The Council are going
to be very upset.

19:15.946 --> 19:18.031
- It was just a little jump!

19:18.115 --> 19:19.408
And it was an emergency.

19:21.577 --> 19:23.620
- Hence the popcorn.

19:23.704 --> 19:24.913
- I can explain that!
JAKE: I don't want to know.

19:24.997 --> 19:28.041
It could make me an accessory.

19:29.543 --> 19:30.878
But I'm sure you had your
reasons

19:30.961 --> 19:32.880
and you can explain it
all at the trial.

19:32.963 --> 19:33.964
- Dad!

19:34.047 --> 19:35.591
- Trial?

19:35.674 --> 19:37.342
Would they really put me
on trial for this?

19:37.426 --> 19:40.721
- Well, it's too serious for
the Council to deal with.

19:40.804 --> 19:42.264
They'll have to kick it up to
Realm Criminal Court.

19:44.224 --> 19:45.434
- Can't you just let it go?

19:45.517 --> 19:46.101
I won't do it again.

19:46.184 --> 19:48.604
- As a member of the Board,

19:48.687 --> 19:50.480
I have an obligation.

19:50.564 --> 19:53.942
Then again, I'd hate to see you
get into any trouble.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.360
- He's bluffing.

19:55.444 --> 19:56.904
He's just trying to scare you
so that he can control you.

19:56.987 --> 19:58.280
It's one of his moves.

19:58.363 --> 19:58.780
- Jax, how dare you?

19:58.864 --> 20:00.782
- It's buttered.

20:00.866 --> 20:03.285
I know you like it plain,
but live a little.

20:03.368 --> 20:04.369
Come on, Emma,
let's get out of here.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.208
- This is awkward.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.629
- (sighing)

20:13.712 --> 20:14.546
Let's get out of here.

20:19.217 --> 20:21.303
- Jax, why did you get
in a fight with your dad?

20:21.386 --> 20:22.846
I could be
in serious trouble.

20:22.930 --> 20:23.931
- You aren't.

20:24.014 --> 20:25.140
Because if you get in trouble,
I get in trouble.

20:25.223 --> 20:28.143
And if I get in trouble,
it makes him look bad.

20:28.226 --> 20:29.478
And that's all
he cares about,

20:29.561 --> 20:32.481
so he's not gonna
let that happen.

20:32.564 --> 20:34.399
- I hope you're right.

20:34.483 --> 20:35.817
But why are you
so angry at him?

20:35.901 --> 20:37.945
Is this about Jessie?

20:38.028 --> 20:39.279
- That's just the beginning.

20:42.157 --> 20:42.366
Emma...

20:44.743 --> 20:47.287
My mom's still alive
and I went to go and see her.

20:47.371 --> 20:48.372
- What?

20:49.748 --> 20:50.540
How can that be?

20:50.624 --> 20:52.334
- She's been hiding
all these years

20:52.417 --> 20:53.669
and my dad cast a spell on me

20:53.752 --> 20:55.712
to make me think
that she was dead.

20:55.796 --> 20:57.339
It's all been one big lie.

20:57.422 --> 20:58.507
- Why would he do that?

20:58.590 --> 21:00.676
- I'm still trying to
figure that out.

21:00.759 --> 21:02.386
- What was it like
to see her?

21:03.595 --> 21:04.805
- It's hard to explain.

21:04.888 --> 21:06.056
It was...

21:06.139 --> 21:08.850
scary, it was crazy,
it was sad,

21:08.934 --> 21:11.520
but it was also really great!

21:11.603 --> 21:13.480
'Cause she's my mom,
you know?

21:13.563 --> 21:14.856
- Jax, that's amazing!

21:14.940 --> 21:17.734
I'm so happy for you.

21:17.818 --> 21:21.363
I can only imagine what it would
be like to see my mom again.

21:21.446 --> 21:23.365
- Emma, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...

21:23.448 --> 21:25.117
- No, this is great.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.493
It's the best news.

21:44.761 --> 21:47.055
- Got a lot of nerve
showing up here.

21:47.139 --> 21:48.098
- Why?

21:48.181 --> 21:49.391
What did I do?

21:49.474 --> 21:51.268
- You think I don't
know Emma dumped you?

21:51.351 --> 21:52.394
- How did you know that?

21:52.477 --> 21:55.063
- I get like 20 MissInformation
updates a day!

21:55.147 --> 21:56.773
I've tried to unsubscribe
but no matter what,

21:56.857 --> 21:59.401
every 15 minutes,

21:59.484 --> 22:01.361
it's "You've been MissInformed".

22:02.654 --> 22:03.905
- Oh.

22:03.989 --> 22:05.323
- So I know she picked
Jemma over Demma

22:05.407 --> 22:08.243
and now you are here trying
to jumpstart Dia.

22:08.326 --> 22:09.536
- Dia?

22:09.619 --> 22:10.746
Oh...
Daniel and Mia right?

22:10.829 --> 22:11.913
I don't really read Gigi's blog
that much it's kinda...

22:11.997 --> 22:13.248
- Sorry to break it you

22:13.331 --> 22:15.417
but I'm not
your consolation prize.

22:15.500 --> 22:16.668
- That's not why I'm here.

22:16.752 --> 22:18.003
- Oh, really?

22:18.086 --> 22:19.504
Then let's hear it.

22:19.588 --> 22:20.756
I'm all ears.

22:20.839 --> 22:21.339
- You really don't remember.

22:21.423 --> 22:23.341
- Don't remember what?

22:23.425 --> 22:24.509
- You.

22:24.593 --> 22:25.802
Me.

22:25.886 --> 22:27.054
The Everglades.

22:27.137 --> 22:27.387
- What are you talking about?

22:29.556 --> 22:30.682
- Okay, this is going to--

22:33.685 --> 22:36.855
This is going to sound crazy
but you have to believe me.

22:36.938 --> 22:37.773
- Crazier than me
and your ex-girlfriend

22:37.856 --> 22:39.775
getting stuck in a zombie
video game?

22:39.858 --> 22:41.943
- True, actually you
might believe this.

22:42.027 --> 22:43.945
- This oughta be good.

22:44.029 --> 22:45.447
- When Emma chose Jax
something happened.

22:45.530 --> 22:47.908
I was bumped out of this world
and into another one.

22:47.991 --> 22:50.660
The Everglades.

22:50.744 --> 22:54.372
- Okay, that's slightly
insane, but go on.

22:54.456 --> 22:55.957
- And you were there, too.

22:56.458 --> 22:57.959
You were with me.

22:58.043 --> 22:59.961
And things felt how
they were supposed to feel.

23:00.045 --> 23:01.171
All along.

23:01.254 --> 23:04.257
- And now, you've officially
passed "just crazy enough"

23:04.341 --> 23:05.967
and entered "too crazy to
believe" territory.

23:06.051 --> 23:07.719
- It's true, I swear!

23:07.803 --> 23:11.306
- Man, getting dumped really
did a number on you, huh?

23:11.389 --> 23:12.849
Good talk.
But I gotta go.

23:12.933 --> 23:13.934
- Wait.

23:15.060 --> 23:16.353
- Let go of me, Daniel.

23:16.436 --> 23:18.355
I'm warning you.

23:18.438 --> 23:18.814
- Ow.

23:18.897 --> 23:20.816
- Bye, Daniel.

23:20.899 --> 23:22.234
And don't come back.

23:22.317 --> 23:23.193
- Fine.

23:23.276 --> 23:24.319
I'm leaving.

23:24.402 --> 23:25.654
For now.

23:25.737 --> 23:26.655
But I'm not
giving up on you.

23:26.738 --> 23:28.448
I remember what we had,
even if you don't.

23:33.954 --> 23:35.705
- I mean, of course
I'm glad that my mom's alive.

23:35.789 --> 23:38.125
It's just...

23:38.208 --> 23:40.961
She didn't even bother to come
and see me all these years.

23:41.044 --> 23:43.171
- Did she explain why
she only took Jessie?

23:43.255 --> 23:44.589
- Yeah, it had something to do

23:44.673 --> 23:45.382
with me having my powers
already.

23:45.465 --> 23:47.259
But every time
I tried to ask,

23:47.342 --> 23:49.219
Maddie's mom just
kept butting in.

23:49.302 --> 23:49.928
- Maddie's mom?

23:50.011 --> 23:52.347
What was she doing there?

23:52.430 --> 23:54.266
- She said that the Van Pelts
were protecting her

23:54.349 --> 23:55.517
from my dad finding them.

23:55.976 --> 23:56.935
- The Van Pelts?

23:57.018 --> 23:59.187
Mrs. Van Pelt?

23:59.271 --> 24:00.313
Protecting them?

24:00.397 --> 24:02.190
- Yeah, it's almost
harder to believe

24:02.274 --> 24:03.400
than the rest of it.

24:04.359 --> 24:06.778
- So when are you gonna
go see her again?

24:10.157 --> 24:11.575
Jax, you've got to.

24:11.658 --> 24:13.869
She's your mom
and she loves you.

24:13.952 --> 24:16.705
You need to go back to her
and ask more questions.

24:16.788 --> 24:18.957
- Yeah, but...

24:19.040 --> 24:20.876
What if I don't
like the answers?

24:20.959 --> 24:22.210
- What do you mean?

24:22.294 --> 24:23.295
- What if she really
didn't want to be my mom?

24:23.378 --> 24:26.047
- Oh, she's not
gonna say that!

24:26.131 --> 24:27.382
You'll see!

24:27.465 --> 24:28.967
- I'll think about it.

24:29.885 --> 24:31.219
- Go!

24:31.303 --> 24:32.262
- What like now?

24:32.345 --> 24:33.513
- Yes, now!

24:35.265 --> 24:37.184
- What are you doing?

24:37.267 --> 24:38.810
- Motivating you.

24:38.894 --> 24:40.020
- Ow!

24:42.022 --> 24:43.023
Hey!

24:44.107 --> 24:46.026
All right.
Okay, I'm going!

24:46.109 --> 24:47.110
I'm going!

24:51.239 --> 24:54.492
- Ugh.
My life is over.

24:54.576 --> 24:58.371
- Don't you think you're
being a little dramatic?

24:58.455 --> 24:59.497
- The opposite!

24:59.581 --> 25:01.333
Dramatic would be like this:

25:01.416 --> 25:03.585
My life is over!

25:06.129 --> 25:09.424
Thank you, thank you,
my beloved audience!

25:09.507 --> 25:11.927
- So you and Diego
had one fight.

25:12.010 --> 25:14.930
You had hundreds of fights with
Daniel, and always made up.

25:15.013 --> 25:16.389
- Except the last time.

25:18.225 --> 25:20.769
- But <i> I</i> was always
mad at him.

25:20.852 --> 25:22.020
Now Proxy is mad at me!

25:22.103 --> 25:24.481
This is...

25:24.564 --> 25:26.024
un-president-y!

25:26.107 --> 25:27.943
- You mean "unpreced--"

25:28.026 --> 25:32.280
Well, have you tried
apologizing to him?

25:32.364 --> 25:34.449
- Oh, that's
a great idea!

25:34.532 --> 25:35.450
I'll just apologize

25:35.533 --> 25:37.369
and everything will
be back to normal!

25:38.787 --> 25:40.247
How do you
do that again?

25:41.706 --> 25:43.500
- Can I help you?
<i>BIRD: Can I help you?</i>

25:43.583 --> 25:46.211
- Yeah, hi, my name is Jax,
I'm looking for my mom.

25:46.294 --> 25:47.295
- Your mother?

25:47.379 --> 25:49.381
Sorry, there's no mothers here,
it's just me.

25:49.464 --> 25:50.548
<i>BIRD: Just me.</i>

25:50.632 --> 25:52.008
- And my birds.
- Birds?

25:53.843 --> 25:55.136
Wait, I'm talking about Liana?

25:55.220 --> 25:57.138
- Who?
- It's okay.

25:57.222 --> 25:58.306
I'm actually her son.

25:58.390 --> 25:59.933
I'm not a spy
for Jake Novoa.

26:00.517 --> 26:02.519
Are you a Van Pelt?

26:02.602 --> 26:04.813
Because Ursula
knows who I am.

26:04.896 --> 26:07.440
- Okay, it seems like
somebody's been

26:07.524 --> 26:09.526
playing too many
video games.

26:09.609 --> 26:10.485
This is the real world
now, buddy.

26:10.568 --> 26:12.279
- Wait, how long have
you lived here?

26:12.362 --> 26:14.531
- Ah, I just moved in.

26:14.614 --> 26:15.657
I've been eyeing this place
for years and then, bam,

26:15.740 --> 26:18.910
it went up for sale so...
I jumped right on it.

26:18.994 --> 26:20.495
<i>BIRD: Right on it!</i>

26:21.496 --> 26:22.747
- Okay.

26:22.831 --> 26:24.165
I'll get out of here then,
sorry to bother you.

26:24.249 --> 26:26.001
- Oh, no, no bother.

26:26.084 --> 26:27.752
But hey, just remember.

26:27.836 --> 26:29.421
This is the real world.

26:29.504 --> 26:31.631
You can't just snap your
fingers and transport away.

26:32.549 --> 26:34.342
- Right.
Thanks.

26:45.854 --> 26:47.188
- You know what?

26:47.272 --> 26:49.065
I think I'll join you.

26:49.149 --> 26:50.108
- What's the matter?

26:50.191 --> 26:51.818
- Eh.

26:51.901 --> 26:52.902
Me and Maddie had a fight.

26:52.986 --> 26:56.406
- And you want to make up?
That's easy, you just...

26:56.489 --> 26:58.199
BOTH: say you're sorry
and buy her something.

26:58.283 --> 27:00.785
- Yeah, but you know,
but this time, I'm not sorry.

27:00.869 --> 27:02.787
Boxing me out of her family
reunion like that?

27:02.871 --> 27:03.872
- Dude...

27:03.955 --> 27:06.041
- After everything
that we've been through!

27:06.124 --> 27:07.334
- Dude...
- What, is she worried

27:07.417 --> 27:08.543
something's
gonna happen if I'm there?

27:08.626 --> 27:09.794
I'm gonna go all Kanay
and light the curtains on fire?

27:09.878 --> 27:10.670
- Dude!

27:13.798 --> 27:15.050
- Okay, but that will
most definitely

27:15.133 --> 27:16.509
not happen if I'm there!

27:16.593 --> 27:18.470
- I don't know what
to tell you, bro.

27:18.553 --> 27:20.847
I've got Kanay-related
problems on my own.

27:20.930 --> 27:22.182
With Mia.

27:22.265 --> 27:23.391
- Tell 'em to Doctor Diego.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.560
- (sighs) She doesn't remember
the life we had together.

27:25.643 --> 27:28.104
She only remembers
what happened here.

27:28.188 --> 27:29.606
Which ended...

27:29.689 --> 27:31.399
- Bad.
- Bad.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.443
- They're so hard
to figure out.

27:33.526 --> 27:34.486
- Who?

27:34.569 --> 27:35.737
Kanays or witches?

27:35.820 --> 27:35.862
- Girls.

27:38.573 --> 27:39.574
- Word.

27:40.575 --> 27:41.618
- Music.

27:41.701 --> 27:45.538
How is that song lineup
thingy coming?

27:45.622 --> 27:48.291
- It's called
a playlist, Mother.

27:48.375 --> 27:49.709
- Maddie Winkie, I...

27:49.793 --> 27:51.127
- Sorry.

27:51.211 --> 27:52.712
It's coming along fine.

27:52.796 --> 27:54.964
- Really?
Let's hear it.

27:55.048 --> 27:56.299
(sad violin music)

27:56.383 --> 27:59.219
- What--what--
What is that?

27:59.302 --> 28:00.261
- What's the problem?

28:00.345 --> 28:02.764
- Maddie, it's not a funeral!

28:02.847 --> 28:04.849
It's a joyous
family occasion

28:04.933 --> 28:07.685
in which we all pretend not to
be jealous of each other!

28:07.769 --> 28:10.397
- Well, I am in charge
of the playlist,

28:10.480 --> 28:13.108
so it's going
to reflect my mood.

28:13.191 --> 28:14.692
- Maddie Winkie,

28:14.776 --> 28:19.114
this is a very important
Van Pelt family reunion.

28:19.197 --> 28:21.282
A new leader of the coven
is going to be selected

28:21.366 --> 28:23.159
and I have big plans.

28:23.243 --> 28:24.702
- Really?

28:24.786 --> 28:27.455
You think I'm ready to lead
the whole coven?

28:27.539 --> 28:30.333
This calls for
another bedazzled sash!

28:30.417 --> 28:32.043
- Not you.

28:32.127 --> 28:33.795
Me!

28:33.878 --> 28:35.505
- Oh...
Really?

28:35.588 --> 28:36.923
- Yes, really!

28:37.006 --> 28:39.843
I would make a fabulous leader
of the Van Pelt coven.

28:39.926 --> 28:41.636
- Of course you would.

28:41.719 --> 28:45.306
And I'm gonna
vote for you, too.

28:45.390 --> 28:48.143
Unless the family
demands that I run,

28:48.226 --> 28:49.519
in which case...

28:49.602 --> 28:50.770
(doorbell rings)

28:50.854 --> 28:52.480
Oh, goody!
Pizza's here.

28:58.903 --> 29:00.613
- That'll be $8.50.

29:00.697 --> 29:01.823
- Keep the change.

29:01.906 --> 29:02.866
- Thanks.

29:05.535 --> 29:06.703
- That's it?

29:06.786 --> 29:08.746
How did that plan not work?

29:11.791 --> 29:13.585
- Gone?
- Moved out!

29:13.668 --> 29:15.753
And now there's some guy
living there with...

29:15.837 --> 29:16.629
birds!
- Oh, no!

29:16.713 --> 29:19.090
Did you faint right
on the doorstep?

29:19.174 --> 29:20.717
- No, I managed to keep
my consciousness.

29:20.800 --> 29:24.345
- Jax, that's so great!
So proud of you.

29:24.429 --> 29:25.847
- Thanks.

29:25.930 --> 29:28.391
But anyway,
back to my mom disappearing.

29:28.475 --> 29:29.767
- Right, sorry.

29:29.851 --> 29:31.060
Where do you think she went?

29:31.144 --> 29:32.770
- I have no idea.

29:32.854 --> 29:35.565
She's been moving around all
these years hiding from my dad,

29:35.648 --> 29:38.026
maybe my dad finally
found out where she was.

29:39.944 --> 29:40.612
Maybe he followed me!

29:40.695 --> 29:43.072
Great, I led him
straight to her!

29:43.156 --> 29:44.199
- You don't know that.

29:44.282 --> 29:46.284
- No, but I'm gonna find out.

29:46.367 --> 29:47.827
- You're going to
confront your dad?

29:47.911 --> 29:50.288
- No, I'd never get
a straight answer from him.

29:50.371 --> 29:52.165
I'll have to
go to another source.

29:52.248 --> 29:53.541
Coming?
- Where?

29:53.625 --> 29:55.335
- To a place I never thought
I'd have to go again.

29:59.255 --> 30:01.049
- Diego's already seen me
in this outfit today!

30:13.061 --> 30:13.978
- $8.50?

30:14.062 --> 30:15.605
- Ten even.
You ordered extra cheese.

30:18.149 --> 30:19.025
- Proxy, wait.

30:20.443 --> 30:22.445
There's something
I want to say to you.

30:22.529 --> 30:25.907
I-- I'm not really
good at this.

30:25.990 --> 30:27.742
It's really hard for me.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.163
Okay.
Here it goes.

30:34.499 --> 30:36.918
$1.50 for extra cheese?
That's highway robbery!

30:40.713 --> 30:41.589
Wait!

30:41.673 --> 30:43.091
Can I get a do-over?

30:44.050 --> 30:46.302
- Hey Gigi, can I get
an "Andi Special."

30:46.386 --> 30:48.054
- What is that?

30:48.137 --> 30:51.891
- Two slices of mushroom and
onion pizza, hold the onion!

30:51.975 --> 30:54.018
I've only been ordering it
for like the past ten years!

30:54.519 --> 30:55.520
- 'Sup, Andi?

30:55.603 --> 30:56.896
Yo, I'm doing that delivery.

30:56.980 --> 30:59.399
You think you can handle
things while I'm back?

30:59.482 --> 31:00.817
- You can't leave again!

31:00.900 --> 31:03.027
We're swamped and I'm live
blogging Sebastian

31:03.111 --> 31:04.279
arguing with his girlfriend!

31:07.991 --> 31:09.450
- They don't look
like they're arguing.

31:09.534 --> 31:10.785
- They are.

31:10.868 --> 31:12.120
According to my blog.

31:12.203 --> 31:13.079
(phone beeping)

31:13.162 --> 31:14.122
- Anyway you wanna come along?

31:14.205 --> 31:14.706
I could use the company.

31:14.789 --> 31:16.624
- Where?
- Maddie's.

31:16.708 --> 31:18.293
She wants to apologize
but she doesn't know how,

31:18.376 --> 31:19.627
so she keeps ordering pizzas

31:19.711 --> 31:21.254
to get me to come over there.

31:21.337 --> 31:23.214
- That's so Maddie it hurts.

31:23.298 --> 31:26.467
- It would be kind of cute
if I wasn't so mad at her.

31:26.551 --> 31:28.344
Anyway, you wanna come along?

31:28.428 --> 31:30.471
Andi Special on me
when we get back.

31:31.889 --> 31:32.890
- Another one?

31:32.974 --> 31:34.684
Did you say anything
to him this time?

31:34.767 --> 31:35.643
- No.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.770
It's so frustrating!

31:37.854 --> 31:39.439
Especially since I'm not
bringing him to the reunion

31:39.522 --> 31:40.481
to protect him.

31:40.565 --> 31:41.482
- From what?

31:41.566 --> 31:44.319
- Hearing my horrible
relatives insult him.

31:44.402 --> 31:45.903
My relatives will use
any reason to put him down.

31:47.864 --> 31:49.157
But I can't even
explain that to him

31:49.240 --> 31:50.825
or else he'll hate
my whole family!

31:50.908 --> 31:51.743
- Yeah.

31:51.826 --> 31:53.077
That's a pickle, all right.

31:56.539 --> 31:57.999
- Pizza is a treatza

31:58.082 --> 31:59.584
we all like to eatza.

31:59.667 --> 32:01.294
Come and take a seatza,

32:01.377 --> 32:03.254
kick up your tired featza,

32:03.338 --> 32:05.882
and have a slice of pizza!

32:07.759 --> 32:09.302
- Oh, hi kids.

32:09.385 --> 32:10.178
Maddie's on the patio.

32:10.261 --> 32:13.222
- Actually, I came
to talk to you.

32:13.306 --> 32:14.682
- Oh.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.100
Well, that's lovely.

32:16.184 --> 32:19.354
But you see, I'm planning
the Van Pelt Family Reunion,

32:19.437 --> 32:20.980
tons of arrangements to make,

32:21.064 --> 32:22.607
so I'll have to take
a rain check on that chat.

32:22.690 --> 32:24.651
Okay?
Good, great, fabulous--

32:24.734 --> 32:26.694
- Mrs. Van Pelt, please!

32:26.778 --> 32:28.029
This will only take a minute.

32:32.325 --> 32:36.245
- I went to go and visit my mom
again, except she was gone.

32:36.329 --> 32:37.330
But you already knew that.
Didn't you?

32:37.413 --> 32:40.375
- Now why would you assume
that I'd know that?

32:40.458 --> 32:42.001
I don't know everything.

32:42.085 --> 32:45.296
As a matter of fact,
there's a lot I don't know.

32:46.214 --> 32:48.049
That did not come out right.

32:48.132 --> 32:50.385
- You said she was under
the protection of the Van Pelts.

32:50.468 --> 32:51.469
And you were there
when I was there.

32:51.552 --> 32:51.969
So I know you know.

32:54.138 --> 32:55.139
- All right.

32:55.223 --> 32:58.893
Yes, I know, but,
I can't tell you.

32:58.976 --> 33:00.103
- Why not?
Did she tell you not to tell me?

33:02.814 --> 33:04.732
- He has a right to know.
He's her son.

33:04.816 --> 33:06.192
- (mumbling)

33:06.275 --> 33:07.652
- Come on,
Mrs. Van Pelt.

33:07.735 --> 33:09.112
We're not little children.

33:09.195 --> 33:10.530
Is it 'cause of his dad?

33:11.989 --> 33:12.990
- I won't tell him.

33:13.074 --> 33:13.449
I promise.

33:13.533 --> 33:15.493
We barely speak.

33:17.662 --> 33:18.830
- Oh, really?

33:18.913 --> 33:21.582
Then I suppose it was just
a coincidence that he got there

33:21.666 --> 33:23.334
like one minute after you left.

33:23.418 --> 33:24.377
- That is why she left!

33:24.460 --> 33:27.588
- I barely got her out
of there in time, Jax!

33:27.672 --> 33:28.548
She didn't even
wanna come with me

33:28.631 --> 33:30.591
because you tried
to turn her against me.

33:30.675 --> 33:32.510
- Please, tell me
where she is!

33:32.593 --> 33:35.596
- Or you'll do what?

33:36.639 --> 33:37.974
(gasps)

33:38.057 --> 33:39.267
Maddie!

33:40.560 --> 33:41.436
You wouldn't dare.

33:41.519 --> 33:43.646
- Not if you tell me
what I need to know.

33:44.939 --> 33:46.149
- What now, Mother?

33:47.275 --> 33:48.985
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa...

33:49.068 --> 33:50.903
I'd lower that hand
if I were you.

33:50.987 --> 33:52.864
- Stay out of this, Maddie.
- Me?

33:52.947 --> 33:54.782
I'm the one whose mother
is being threatened!

33:54.866 --> 33:58.286
- Yeah, Emma,
I'm surprised at you.

33:58.369 --> 33:59.495
I know Jax is difficult,

33:59.579 --> 34:00.788
but I always thought
you were fairly reasonable.

34:00.872 --> 34:03.416
- Well, maybe you thought wrong!

34:03.499 --> 34:04.917
Now back off.

34:08.379 --> 34:08.880
- Just tell him
where his mother is

34:08.963 --> 34:10.630
and nobody has to...

34:10.715 --> 34:12.967
- Get turned into
an ice sculpture.

34:13.050 --> 34:15.303
- Ooh, an ice sculpture?

34:15.386 --> 34:18.181
We can use it at the party
to keep the caviar cold.

34:18.264 --> 34:19.139
- Maddie!

34:19.223 --> 34:20.975
They're talking about me!

34:21.058 --> 34:21.601
- Oh!

34:21.684 --> 34:23.811
Yeah, never mind.

34:23.895 --> 34:24.270
Everybody back off!

34:25.980 --> 34:28.900
- Whoa!
What's going on in here?

34:28.983 --> 34:30.109
- Proxy, help!

34:30.193 --> 34:31.485
It's a code pink!

34:34.614 --> 34:36.866
- You have your own color-coded
emergency system?

34:36.949 --> 34:38.159
- "Obvi."

34:38.242 --> 34:40.661
- Nobody touches Maddie,
or else.

34:40.745 --> 34:42.830
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
okay, everybody simmer down!

34:42.914 --> 34:44.581
I mean,
we're all friends here...

34:44.665 --> 34:46.501
kind of, right?

34:47.335 --> 34:48.920
Can somebody
please explain to me

34:49.003 --> 34:49.795
why we are having
this magic meltdown?

34:49.879 --> 34:53.007
(all shouting at once)

34:53.090 --> 34:55.134
- And Maddie called out
a code pink!

34:55.217 --> 34:58.763
- Okay, well, that really
cleared things up.

34:58.846 --> 35:01.557
Regardless,
everybody relax,

35:01.641 --> 35:03.142
and let's not do something
we might regret later.

35:06.729 --> 35:07.814
Good.

35:08.606 --> 35:11.692
Okay, Emma, Jax,

35:11.776 --> 35:13.945
you guys should go.

35:14.028 --> 35:16.572
- What? Us?
Why not them?

35:16.656 --> 35:18.324
- We live here, genius.

35:18.407 --> 35:19.700
- It's our house.

35:19.784 --> 35:21.077
- Right.

35:21.160 --> 35:21.744
- Come on, Jax.

35:21.828 --> 35:25.123
- Well, would you at least

35:25.206 --> 35:26.582
give this to my mother?

35:26.666 --> 35:28.626
Let her decide whether
she wants to trust me or not.

35:35.842 --> 35:37.677
- Yes, I'll give it to her.

35:38.803 --> 35:41.097
- Now was that so hard?

35:41.180 --> 35:42.390
MADDIE: (scoffs)

35:42.473 --> 35:43.307
ANDI: (whispering)
Let's go.

35:48.521 --> 35:50.690
MADDIE: Proxy, you were
so brave back there.

35:50.773 --> 35:52.567
- Nobody messes with my girl,

35:52.650 --> 35:54.402
Chosen One or not.

35:54.485 --> 35:57.071
- Can you believe Emma
threatened me like that?

35:57.154 --> 35:59.115
What's gotten into her?

35:59.198 --> 35:59.240
She's...

36:02.118 --> 36:02.577
I'm still your girl?

36:02.660 --> 36:05.705
- Of course.

36:05.788 --> 36:08.082
Me being upset with you
doesn't change that.

36:08.165 --> 36:09.750
- Proxy, I...
KATIE: Soph!

36:09.834 --> 36:11.794
What are you doing?

36:11.878 --> 36:13.504
- I was trying
to hang the piñata.

36:13.588 --> 36:14.964
But this is way more fun!

36:15.047 --> 36:17.174
- Maddie, could you just...

36:20.511 --> 36:22.471
- Wow.

36:22.555 --> 36:25.099
The decorations have
really come a long way.

36:25.182 --> 36:26.684
I'm sure the Van Pelts
are gonna be very impressed.

36:26.767 --> 36:28.060
- Well, okay.

36:28.144 --> 36:31.272
This is getting
a bit too awkward.

36:31.355 --> 36:33.024
Sophie, let's go inside.

36:33.107 --> 36:35.651
- But awkwardness
is my favorite feeling!

36:37.737 --> 36:39.780
- I'm sure the Van Pelts
are gonna love everything.

36:39.864 --> 36:41.407
Especially since
I won't be there.

36:42.533 --> 36:43.743
- Proxy!

36:43.826 --> 36:45.369
It's not like that.

36:45.453 --> 36:47.330
- Then what is it like?

36:47.413 --> 36:50.291
- This reunion
is serious family business!

36:50.374 --> 36:51.959
They're electing a new leader
of the Van Pelt's

36:52.043 --> 36:53.753
and all signs indicate
that it's going to be me.

36:53.836 --> 36:56.005
- And you don't you want me
there to share your big night?

36:56.923 --> 36:59.800
- Proxy, please understand.

36:59.884 --> 37:01.636
Everyone there
is going to be a witch.

37:03.512 --> 37:06.849
And they all feel the same way
my mom does about Kanays.

37:06.933 --> 37:08.559
- I thought that we
were going to change

37:08.643 --> 37:10.645
what people thought about
witches and Kanays.

37:10.728 --> 37:12.313
- We are...

37:12.396 --> 37:14.482
but there are
just too many of them.

37:15.232 --> 37:17.944
And they're all
so horrible.

37:18.027 --> 37:20.029
Come on.
It's just for one night.

37:20.112 --> 37:23.532
- If it's just for one night,
why does it matter?

37:23.616 --> 37:24.742
I can handle it!

37:24.825 --> 37:26.243
- I'm trying to spare
your feelings!

37:26.327 --> 37:26.827
But you're the one
making this difficult.

37:26.911 --> 37:28.663
- You know what?

37:31.415 --> 37:33.501
Maybe this relationship
is too difficult.

37:33.584 --> 37:34.168
- Maybe it is.

37:34.251 --> 37:36.295
- I guess that's it then.

37:36.379 --> 37:37.505
- I guess it is.

37:37.588 --> 37:38.923
- Fine.
- Fine.

37:45.096 --> 37:46.472
(crying)

37:46.555 --> 37:47.348
KATIE: What happened?

37:47.932 --> 37:50.518
- I think we just...

37:51.769 --> 37:53.270
- You just... what?

37:53.938 --> 37:54.814
Oh!

37:54.897 --> 37:56.899
Oh, no...

38:04.657 --> 38:05.658
- That was intense back
there at Maddie's.

38:05.741 --> 38:09.161
- I shouldn't have let
things get out of hand.

38:09.245 --> 38:11.163
But I was just
looking out for Jax.

38:11.247 --> 38:14.041
I mean--he has the chance
to have a mother again!

38:14.125 --> 38:14.875
- And could you believe
I was the peacemaker?

38:14.959 --> 38:17.336
Usually, I'm the hothead.

38:17.420 --> 38:19.922
Could that be a result
of the Continuum Break?

38:20.006 --> 38:21.465
Has my personality shifted?

38:38.607 --> 38:39.692
- Whoa...

38:39.775 --> 38:41.819
It's like a laser
light show in here,

38:41.902 --> 38:43.612
but way cooler...

38:43.696 --> 38:45.072
Why are you doing all this?

38:45.156 --> 38:46.782
- There have been reports
from the Realm

38:46.866 --> 38:49.744
that we might be entering
a period of trouble.

38:50.828 --> 38:51.704
Don't worry.

38:51.787 --> 38:54.331
I would never let
anything happen to you.

38:54.415 --> 38:55.958
- No one's gonna mess with me.

38:56.042 --> 38:57.168
I'll hit 'em
with one of my spells

38:57.251 --> 38:58.586
and knock 'em out.

38:58.669 --> 39:00.463
I'm the champion
of the world!

39:00.546 --> 39:02.506
I mean, the realm!

39:05.301 --> 39:06.886
- All right.

39:06.969 --> 39:08.637
Now, let's take care
of my office.

39:16.520 --> 39:17.021
- (giggling)
Hi, Jax.

39:17.104 --> 39:18.397
- What is going on?

39:18.481 --> 39:21.233
- Looks like Dad's
new security system works.

39:21.317 --> 39:23.778
- Dad got a new
security system? Why?

39:23.861 --> 39:24.862
- He says there's realm
trouble coming.

39:24.945 --> 39:28.949
But I kinda have this
feeling it's about Mom.

39:29.033 --> 39:32.119
- But these are anti-magic traps
and Mom's a human.

39:32.203 --> 39:33.996
Why would he be worried about
her coming here when

39:34.080 --> 39:36.332
she's the one who's been hiding
from him for ten years?

39:36.415 --> 39:37.958
- That's what you say,

39:38.042 --> 39:41.045
but it never really seemed like
we were hiding from anybody.

39:41.128 --> 39:44.632
And you say Dad is bad,
but I don't see that.

39:44.715 --> 39:45.841
- He's fooling you
with his charm.

39:45.925 --> 39:48.052
I'm sorry, Jessie.

39:48.135 --> 39:50.805
I know he's our dad,
but he's a bad guy.

39:50.888 --> 39:52.139
- No he's not.
Take that back.

39:52.223 --> 39:52.807
- No.

39:52.890 --> 39:54.975
- Okay, fine.

39:55.059 --> 39:57.561
Then you'll spend
all night in there.

39:57.645 --> 39:58.687
- Jessie!

39:58.771 --> 40:00.397
Jessie!

40:00.481 --> 40:01.565
Fine.

40:01.649 --> 40:02.441
I take it back.

40:10.199 --> 40:11.826
(laughing) I had
my fingers crossed!

40:11.909 --> 40:14.411
- What!
(growls)

40:17.498 --> 40:18.833
- Why won't you just
leave me alone?

40:18.916 --> 40:20.042
- Because I know something is up
with you and Maddie.

40:20.126 --> 40:21.460
Fact: You didn't have

40:21.544 --> 40:23.879
your daily morning
emoji conversation.

40:23.963 --> 40:26.090
- We don't have a daily
morning emoji conversation.

40:26.173 --> 40:27.550
- Yes, you do.

40:27.633 --> 40:29.844
Usually by now you've sent her
heart eyes, face throwing

40:29.927 --> 40:32.513
a kiss, smiling cat
face with heart shaped eyes.

40:32.596 --> 40:35.474
And she's sent back the couple
with heart, kissing cat face

40:35.558 --> 40:37.852
with closed eyes,
and a growing heart.

40:37.935 --> 40:39.436
- How do you know that?

40:39.520 --> 40:41.188
- Uh... wild guess?

40:41.272 --> 40:43.566
- You hacked my phone,
didn't you?

40:43.649 --> 40:44.692
Your own brother?

40:46.193 --> 40:47.695
Mom and Dad are not gonna
be happy about this.

40:47.778 --> 40:48.696
- Oh, you wouldn't.

40:48.779 --> 40:49.738
- Oh, try me.

40:52.867 --> 40:53.367
- Emma.

40:53.451 --> 40:55.786
How good of you to come.

40:55.870 --> 40:57.329
- What did you want
to see me about?

40:57.413 --> 40:59.373
- We've received
an anonymous report

40:59.456 --> 41:02.877
that says that you did
a Time Jump.

41:04.295 --> 41:05.713
- Anonymous?

41:05.796 --> 41:07.631
Gee, thanks, Mr. Novoa.

41:08.966 --> 41:11.093
- Nobody said anything
about Jake Novoa.

41:11.177 --> 41:12.887
- Uh-huh.

41:12.970 --> 41:15.681
Well, is that it?

41:15.764 --> 41:18.184
- We are very
concerned about it.

41:18.267 --> 41:20.144
- What a surprise!

41:20.227 --> 41:22.563
You are very concerned.

41:22.646 --> 41:24.064
What was the last thing I did

41:24.148 --> 41:26.233
that didn't have you
very concerned?

41:26.317 --> 41:28.402
- Emma, we're not here
to criticize you.

41:28.485 --> 41:29.945
We're here to help you.

41:30.029 --> 41:30.738
- You could help me
by not worrying

41:30.821 --> 41:33.782
about every
little thing I do.

41:33.866 --> 41:36.410
Maybe you should spend your time
looking into real problems.

41:36.493 --> 41:38.162
Oh, like Jake Novoa.

41:38.245 --> 41:39.079
- What do you mean?

41:39.163 --> 41:41.248
- For starters,
he put a spell on Jax

41:41.332 --> 41:43.209
to make him think
his mother was dead!

41:43.292 --> 41:44.585
Did you know about that?

41:44.668 --> 41:46.420
What about Jax's mom?

41:46.503 --> 41:48.255
Did you know she's been in
hiding from Jax's dad

41:48.339 --> 41:49.632
for ten years?

41:51.258 --> 41:52.343
Why won't you say something?

41:52.426 --> 41:53.594
What are you afraid of?

41:53.677 --> 41:55.429
- Jake Novoa
is very powerful.

41:55.512 --> 41:56.931
He doesn't take it lightly
if somebody crosses him.

41:57.014 --> 41:59.266
EMMA: (laughing)

41:59.350 --> 42:01.477
You are afraid of him!

42:01.560 --> 42:03.896
Is that how things
work in the Realm?

42:03.979 --> 42:06.857
You get your way by making
people afraid of you?

42:06.941 --> 42:08.108
Maybe I ought to try it out

42:08.192 --> 42:09.735
because all I get
out of being nice is,

42:09.818 --> 42:11.445
(mocking tone)
"We are very concerned."

42:11.528 --> 42:12.738
- Emma, please.

42:12.821 --> 42:13.614
- I've been silent
too long it's time to roar

42:13.697 --> 42:16.242
so on this Council
start a downpour.

42:16.325 --> 42:16.659
- Oh, no!

42:20.120 --> 42:21.247
- How about this?

42:21.330 --> 42:22.957
Does this concern you?

42:25.918 --> 42:28.796
- How are you still
eating pizza?

42:28.879 --> 42:31.048
- It's a treatza...

42:41.267 --> 42:41.725
- Come on, Soph!

42:45.604 --> 42:47.231
- Dude, I'm here for you.

42:47.314 --> 42:49.316
Whatever you need.
Okay?

42:49.400 --> 42:51.193
- Thanks, man.

42:51.277 --> 42:52.152
- You know what?

42:52.236 --> 42:55.155
We should do some kind of
healing ritual,

42:55.239 --> 42:58.409
delete Mia and Maddie's
number off our phone!

42:58.492 --> 42:59.493
Wait.

42:59.576 --> 43:01.495
I don't even have Mia's number.

43:01.578 --> 43:03.789
We should both delete Maddie's
number off our phone.

43:05.040 --> 43:07.585
Number, trash bin, delete!

43:10.087 --> 43:12.840
- Wait, how did you even know
that me and Maddie broke up?

43:12.923 --> 43:14.967
I didn't even tell...

43:15.050 --> 43:16.260
Gigi!

43:18.304 --> 43:20.347
- I can't believe you
said that to the Council.

43:20.431 --> 43:21.890
And then a rainstorm?

43:23.142 --> 43:24.101
Are you sure that
was a good idea?

43:24.184 --> 43:26.186
- What can they do to me?

43:26.270 --> 43:27.563
- They're the Council.

43:27.646 --> 43:28.772
They're powerful.

43:28.856 --> 43:30.691
- That's just it.

43:30.774 --> 43:32.151
I don't think they really are.

43:32.234 --> 43:33.694
All this time,
I've been afraid of them

43:33.777 --> 43:36.780
but it turns out, they're
the ones who are afraid.

43:36.864 --> 43:38.615
(door bell ringing)

43:41.952 --> 43:43.454
Hi.
Can I help you?

43:43.537 --> 43:44.413
- I hope so.

43:44.496 --> 43:45.372
My name is Liana.

43:45.456 --> 43:47.041
I'm looking for Jax Novoa.

43:47.124 --> 43:48.542
He said I could
find him here?

43:48.625 --> 43:50.419
- Mrs. Novoa...

43:50.502 --> 43:51.462
- It's Woods.

43:51.545 --> 43:52.546
Ms. Woods.

43:52.629 --> 43:54.089
Is Jax here?

43:54.173 --> 43:55.049
- Not right now.

43:55.132 --> 43:55.924
But he will be soon.

43:56.008 --> 43:57.885
- Do you think
I could wait inside?

43:57.968 --> 44:00.262
I don't think it's
safe for me out here.

44:00.346 --> 44:02.014
I think I'm
being followed.
