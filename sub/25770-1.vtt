12:13.347 --> 12:15.049
Goodness. Mommy!

12:16.449 --> 12:18.182
[Bruce] She's ruined.

12:18.184 --> 12:19.219
I can fix it.

12:21.288 --> 12:23.524
Get out!
[pants]

12:25.391 --> 12:26.526
My bad.

12:27.460 --> 12:28.461
[Lucas sighs]

12:30.497 --> 12:33.133
Don't let your man cave
become your tomb, Bruce.

12:38.405 --> 12:39.406
[door closes]

12:45.045 --> 12:46.046

[somber music]

13:04.296 --> 13:05.495
[sighs heavily]

13:05.497 --> 13:08.736
Even your belt doesn't want
to be around you, Mr. Kent.

13:09.569 --> 13:10.570
I know.

13:11.637 --> 13:13.437
I know.

13:13.439 --> 13:15.072
[Lisp] It's taken me years

13:15.074 --> 13:18.143
of science and mathematics
and calibrations.

13:18.145 --> 13:20.544
But once this doomsday device
is complete,

13:20.546 --> 13:23.313
we will have the most epic,

13:23.315 --> 13:25.783
devastating, doomsday device
in existence.

13:25.785 --> 13:27.085
I love it.

13:27.087 --> 13:28.820
But first, we need an army.

13:28.822 --> 13:30.488
Ooh, could we dress them up
like little clowns?

13:30.490 --> 13:32.557
Yes, clowns.

13:32.559 --> 13:34.725
And then I need
the Star Death Krypto Tesseract

13:34.727 --> 13:36.226
to power the device.

13:36.228 --> 13:38.129
I just happen to know a guy.

13:38.131 --> 13:41.566
But first, we need to kidnap
Superbat's son.

13:41.568 --> 13:42.833
Yeah, anything
to annoy Superbat.

13:42.835 --> 13:44.101
[giggles]

13:44.103 --> 13:45.736
And we take the superpowered DNA

13:45.738 --> 13:47.438
that lies dormant in his system.

13:47.440 --> 13:49.273
I'll leave that nerdy stuff
up to you.

13:49.275 --> 13:52.409
And we splice his DNA
with my current henchmen,

13:52.411 --> 13:54.379
- making super soldiers!
- Okay, enough!

13:54.381 --> 13:55.482
Geez!

13:56.116 --> 13:57.117
[grunts]

13:57.818 --> 14:00.453
Wow, that looks really...

14:01.454 --> 14:03.187
dumb, Lisp.

14:03.189 --> 14:04.456
It looks like a coffee machine

14:04.458 --> 14:06.323
with a bunch
of science stuff taped to it.

14:06.325 --> 14:09.793
Oh, but, Jokester.
Looks are deceiving.

14:09.795 --> 14:12.596
[Lisp] Once this device
is complete,

14:12.598 --> 14:15.432
we'll have the whole world
bending at the kneecaps.

14:15.434 --> 14:16.567
Don't get too excited

14:16.569 --> 14:18.302
about your silly
little doomsday device.

14:18.304 --> 14:20.304
Its powers are insignificant

14:20.306 --> 14:22.273
next to the naughtiness
of the farce.

14:22.275 --> 14:24.374
Oh. The farce?

14:24.376 --> 14:26.878
Please don't try to threaten me
with some mumbo...

14:26.880 --> 14:29.681
[groans]
Gosh, what's this?

14:29.683 --> 14:32.517
I find your lack
of humor disturbing.

14:32.519 --> 14:34.418
[Lisp gasps, laughs]

14:34.420 --> 14:36.589
Stop it! You're tickling me!
Stop!

14:37.424 --> 14:38.655
Stop it! Stop it!

14:38.657 --> 14:39.791
- I'm gonna pee, I swear.
- Ah, ah, ah!

14:39.793 --> 14:43.827
The importance of this mission
is no laughing matter.

14:43.829 --> 14:45.800
- [Jokester laughs]
- Ooh! Put me down.

14:47.733 --> 14:49.701
[groans, gasps]

14:49.703 --> 14:52.669
Dark Jokester, you're a clown.

14:52.671 --> 14:55.405
Laughing is the only thing
that matters.

14:55.407 --> 14:56.609
[Jokester] I can still hear you.

14:57.376 --> 14:58.378
Idiot.

[El Capitan] Oh, gracias, amigo.

15:12.892 --> 15:16.628
So she says to me, "Hey!
You forgot to save my husband."

15:16.630 --> 15:18.428
And I was like, "No, I didn't."

15:18.430 --> 15:22.167

Well, well, well.
If it isn't Ironing Man himself?

15:55.234 --> 15:57.368
Cute boots and belt, SuperFat.

15:57.370 --> 15:58.372
[Bruce] Thank you.

- I wouldn't know.
- Hm.

16:01.841 --> 16:03.508
No, seriously.
That suit could use a trip

16:03.510 --> 16:05.409
to one of my four million
dry cleaners worldwide.

16:05.411 --> 16:06.878
- [Bruce] Could it?
- [Tony] Super clean.

16:06.880 --> 16:09.379
Super fast. Super cheap.

16:09.381 --> 16:11.682
Super what?

16:11.684 --> 16:13.518
Here's a five-dollar coupon

16:22.828 --> 16:25.830
and she, uh, wanted me
to offer you...

16:25.832 --> 16:27.398
I don't know.
Some sort of position.

16:27.400 --> 16:28.466
Not interested.

16:28.468 --> 16:29.533
I don't know why
she would call you.

16:29.535 --> 16:30.601
I'm doing fine.

16:30.603 --> 16:31.638
Speak of the she-devil.

16:32.705 --> 16:34.304
- Hi.
- [Tony] Jean Wonder.

16:34.306 --> 16:36.240
You're looking wonderful
in those jeans.

16:36.242 --> 16:39.009
Oh, Tony. You always know
how to talk to women.

My kids are dying to meet you.

Can you blame them?
I'm dying to meet myself.

Come here.

17:02.668 --> 17:03.734
Happy birthday, kids.

17:03.736 --> 17:05.336

17:32.965 --> 17:35.700
But we're outnumbered.
Even Tony Starch is here.

at least six other kids

22:39.172 --> 22:41.238
at home and we planned
a trip to Mexico to visit

22:41.240 --> 22:42.239
my wife's parents
before the new kid arrives

22:42.241 --> 22:43.374
so I can't really commit
to a rescue right now.

22:43.376 --> 22:45.776
In fact, I should be home.
Yes, I'm definitely late.

22:45.778 --> 22:47.612
I trust you understand
my position

22:47.614 --> 22:48.779
and I hope that another
mission presents itself

22:48.781 --> 22:50.114
in the near future at which
time you should contact me

22:50.116 --> 22:52.749
and perhaps
we can work together then.

22:52.751 --> 22:54.218
It's been a lovely party, yeah,

22:54.220 --> 22:55.856
um, I wish you the best.

23:00.126 --> 23:01.826
I'm really sorry, Superbat,

23:01.828 --> 23:05.663
but I've gotta get home
and feed my cats their spiders

23:05.665 --> 23:07.233
and my spiders their cats,

23:08.166 --> 23:10.233
and my spider cats.

23:10.235 --> 23:11.671
I don't know what they eat yet.

23:13.205 --> 23:14.206
[Bruce] Thorbacca?

23:15.907 --> 23:18.041
[grunts]

23:18.043 --> 23:19.943
Bruce, I really want to,
but you know,

23:19.945 --> 23:21.412
it's a very busy time
of the year you know,

23:21.414 --> 23:24.181
with the convention of the gods,
and, uh...

23:24.183 --> 23:27.417
But may our paths cross again
in another shared universe.

23:27.419 --> 23:31.355
Now, I, I bid thee farewell!

23:31.357 --> 23:33.726
[both growl]

23:35.427 --> 23:37.630
- [thunder rumbles]
- [poofs]

23:39.298 --> 23:40.634
Come on.

23:47.973 --> 23:49.009
[sighs]

23:50.777 --> 23:52.078
[Jokester] <i>It's not fair.</i>

23:52.979 --> 23:54.244
[thuds]

23:54.246 --> 23:56.749
She's more powerful
than I had imagined.

23:57.316 --> 23:58.883
[rattles]

23:58.885 --> 24:00.684
She's just a girl!

24:00.686 --> 24:03.119
- It's not! No!
- [thwacking]

24:03.121 --> 24:06.222
Not! It's not fair!

24:06.224 --> 24:08.826
It is not!

24:08.828 --> 24:10.728
[grunts, pants]

24:10.730 --> 24:12.762
Whoa, this place is awesome!

24:12.764 --> 24:15.165
Oh. Sour toxic shocks,
I love these.

24:15.167 --> 24:16.933
But soon...

24:16.935 --> 24:22.440
you will learn to harness
all your powers,

24:22.442 --> 24:26.713
and we will rule
the galaxy together.

24:27.879 --> 24:29.181
- Okay.
- Here.

24:29.816 --> 24:30.881
[clatters]

24:30.883 --> 24:33.049
Have some candy, boy.

24:33.051 --> 24:34.286
Just one, just one.

24:38.758 --> 24:40.293
I suppose
it's good to get it out.

24:44.297 --> 24:45.799
[Bruce] Sweet, sweet Mommy.

24:46.866 --> 24:49.036
Mommy. I'm so sorry.

24:50.502 --> 24:52.438
- Bruce!
- [gasps]

24:54.240 --> 24:55.873
Goodness! You are filthy, honey.

24:55.875 --> 24:57.107
Take a shower.

24:57.109 --> 24:59.442
Okay. So I was thinking,

24:59.444 --> 25:02.747
Dark Jokester said there's
a naughty side of the farce.

25:02.749 --> 25:04.147
So if there's a naughty side,

25:04.149 --> 25:06.416
there must be a nice side
as well.

25:06.418 --> 25:08.155
I know somebody
who knows about this stuff.

25:09.222 --> 25:11.023
Who? Gandalf?

25:12.023 --> 25:13.089
Dumbledore?

25:13.091 --> 25:14.357
Obi Wan?

25:14.359 --> 25:16.126
Professor Xavier?

25:16.128 --> 25:18.264
Ah, Old Rocky Balboa!

25:18.998 --> 25:20.367
Jean Roqua?

25:22.335 --> 25:25.035
- From <i>Never Back Down?</i>
- Maybe.

25:25.037 --> 25:26.836
This isn't some stupid
science fiction

25:26.838 --> 25:28.538
or coming-of-age
martial arts story.

25:28.540 --> 25:30.207
This is serious.

25:30.209 --> 25:33.376
I'm talking about
my former yoga instructor,

25:33.378 --> 25:35.014
Master Yoga.

25:36.382 --> 25:38.782
Oh, he is incredible!

25:38.784 --> 25:39.884
I texted him.

25:39.886 --> 25:40.751
You know, I'm not really

25:40.753 --> 25:42.853
into all that new age
nonsense, honey,

25:42.855 --> 25:44.288
it's just, I'm not.

25:44.290 --> 25:47.791
My father knew Dark Jokester.
My real father.

25:47.793 --> 25:50.827
A long time ago, Dark Jokester
came to destroy his planet.

25:50.829 --> 25:53.297
And that's why he put me
in that gold spaceship

25:53.299 --> 25:55.165
that my Earth parents
found me in.

25:55.167 --> 25:57.233
And then my Earth parents melted
the spaceship down

25:57.235 --> 25:59.238
and cashed in the gold
for billions.

26:00.306 --> 26:01.872
I never knew that about you.

26:01.874 --> 26:02.740
Me neither.

26:02.742 --> 26:04.874
I had to read it
on my Wikipedia page.

26:04.876 --> 26:06.810
Then it must be true.
[scoffs]

26:06.812 --> 26:08.380
- [cell phone chimes]
- Oh.

26:09.549 --> 26:11.414
[Jean] Oh, Master Yoga replied.

26:11.416 --> 26:14.551
He says, "I know about The Farce
and will train your husband."

26:14.553 --> 26:17.387
So cute!
He put this little Farce emoji.

26:17.389 --> 26:19.056
[chuckles]

26:19.058 --> 26:21.424
- Aw.
- All right, I have a question.

26:21.426 --> 26:25.162
What if Lucas
is just done with us?

26:25.164 --> 26:27.030
Think about it.
I mean, he's 17 years old.

26:27.032 --> 26:28.868
Maybe it's time
that we just let him go.

26:29.601 --> 26:31.067
Let him go?

26:31.069 --> 26:32.403
Do you have bats in your brain?

26:32.405 --> 26:33.604
No, uh...

26:33.606 --> 26:35.405
I'm just saying.
All of this, you know,

26:35.407 --> 26:37.343
it all can't be just bad luck.

26:39.444 --> 26:42.048
You take that back
right now, Bruce Kent!

26:43.081 --> 26:44.147
I want you to think

26:44.149 --> 26:46.083
and be very clear
with your words.

26:46.085 --> 26:47.951
You want me to be clear
with my words?

26:47.953 --> 26:50.487
Okay, how's this for clear?
I have no job, no money,

26:50.489 --> 26:52.489
and my powers are evaporating.

26:52.491 --> 26:54.024
I just killed Tony Starch,

26:54.026 --> 26:55.992
and now the kids
don't want me around anymore.

26:55.994 --> 26:57.862
And my marriage
to Jean Wonder is,

26:57.864 --> 27:00.564
surprise, surprise.
Not wonderful.

27:00.566 --> 27:03.032
Now my car got stolen
by your son,

27:03.034 --> 27:05.035
who's working
with my father's murderer

27:05.037 --> 27:06.470
to become my new archenemy.

27:06.472 --> 27:07.404
And to top it all off,

27:07.406 --> 27:10.143
I am now covered
in my dead mother's ashes.

27:11.174 --> 27:11.374
Is that clear enough for you?

27:11.376 --> 27:13.477
Then leave!

27:13.479 --> 27:15.144
I'm not leaving.
This is my house.

27:15.146 --> 27:16.249
Fine, I'll leave.

27:17.515 --> 27:19.215
[scoffs]

27:19.217 --> 27:20.820
What happened
to the man I married?

27:21.253 --> 27:22.421
[sighs]

27:27.393 --> 27:28.862
[sighs heavily]

27:35.635 --> 27:36.837
Mommy.

27:44.510 --> 27:45.878
[Jean] Raya!

27:47.280 --> 27:48.381
Raya!

27:49.048 --> 27:50.647
Bruce!

27:50.649 --> 27:52.115
- [sighs]
- [Bruce] What?

27:52.117 --> 27:53.651
Raya's gone!

27:53.653 --> 27:56.220
- Oh, really? Come on!
- Yes!

27:56.222 --> 27:57.624
[sighs heavily]

27:58.491 --> 27:59.593
You know,

28:00.659 --> 28:02.428
you say one thing to that girl.

28:03.361 --> 28:05.261
[Bruce] Raya Gladys Kent!

28:05.263 --> 28:07.096
[Jean] You really upset her
last night.

28:07.098 --> 28:08.531
[Bruce] Please!
I was just talking to her.

28:08.533 --> 28:10.169
She's so emotional at that age.

28:11.103 --> 28:13.369
- Raya!
- [Jean] Raya!

28:13.371 --> 28:14.337
[cell phone chimes]

28:14.339 --> 28:16.941
- [Jean] Oh! She just texted.
- [Bruce] Really?

28:16.943 --> 28:18.011
- Read it.
- [Jean] Yeah.

28:19.211 --> 28:20.443
- Out loud, please.
- Oh.

28:20.445 --> 28:22.348
"Gone to look for Lucas
and save family."

28:23.049 --> 28:24.381
All right, gosh.

28:24.383 --> 28:26.083
I'm gonna call Lando.
I think he can fix this.

28:26.085 --> 28:28.986
No, no! I do not trust Lando.

28:28.988 --> 28:30.323
Why? Because he has dreads?

28:30.990 --> 28:32.155
No!

28:32.157 --> 28:33.557
Because he has an eye patch.

28:33.559 --> 28:35.392
All right? I don't trust people
with eye patches.

28:35.394 --> 28:37.961
Pirates have eye patches.
Do you trust a pirate?

28:37.963 --> 28:39.462
Bruce!
What are we supposed to do?

28:39.464 --> 28:41.065
Both of our kids have gone
somewhere. I mean I...

28:41.067 --> 28:42.266
Oh, hey, hey, hey.
[shushes]

28:42.268 --> 28:46.103
It's okay. Calm down. All right?
I will take care of this.

28:46.105 --> 28:49.405
You go talk to Lando
and find Raya.

28:49.407 --> 28:51.307
And I will go see
your Master Yoga,

28:51.309 --> 28:52.643
- and look for Lucas, okay?
- Really?

28:52.645 --> 28:54.144
- Yes.
- Thank you.

28:54.146 --> 28:55.746
We've gotta get
our family back, right?

28:55.748 --> 28:57.047
Yes.

28:57.049 --> 28:58.115
- Okay.
- [Jean] Okay.

28:58.117 --> 28:59.049
- All right, I'm gonna go.
- Okay.

28:59.051 --> 29:00.718
But, uh, I'm gonna go
put some pants on.

29:00.720 --> 29:01.922
- Yep.
- [Bruce] Yep.

29:02.722 --> 29:03.654
- Raya!
- [line ringing]

29:03.656 --> 29:06.089
Help me, Lando Fury.
You're my only hope.

29:06.091 --> 29:07.357
[line ringing]

29:07.359 --> 29:12.061
[Lisp] First, we locate
Lucas's superpower DNA

29:12.063 --> 29:14.631
that lies dormant in his system,

29:14.633 --> 29:19.002
and we mash it together
with henchman number one's DNA.

29:19.004 --> 29:21.771
Thus, making clown trooper
number one.

29:21.773 --> 29:22.839
Okay.

29:22.841 --> 29:24.575
[Lisp] And then, I will take
that clown trooper,

29:24.577 --> 29:26.676
and put it into
another henchman's body.

29:26.678 --> 29:29.113
Then that clown trooper
makes another clown trooper...

29:29.115 --> 29:31.315
- I'm confused.
- ...and so on and so forth,

29:31.317 --> 29:34.151
until we have
a large enough army

29:34.153 --> 29:36.487
to your liking, Lord Jokester.

29:36.489 --> 29:39.189
Sounds clowny and cloney.
[giggles]

29:39.191 --> 29:41.191
Let's do it!
[laughs]

29:41.193 --> 29:44.196
Henchman number one,
enter the device.

29:45.063 --> 29:47.232
[foreboding music]

29:48.768 --> 29:50.002
[door squeaks]

29:51.302 --> 29:53.170
[lock clinks]

29:53.172 --> 29:55.107
[Lisp] Lucas, my dear boy...

29:55.674 --> 29:57.644
enter the device.

30:01.047 --> 30:02.348
- [lock clinks]
- [door squeaks]

30:04.617 --> 30:06.019
[sighs]

30:07.118 --> 30:08.221
Watch your cape.

30:13.626 --> 30:15.392
This ain't gonna hurt him,
is it?

30:15.394 --> 30:17.430
You might want
to stand back for this.

30:19.298 --> 30:20.396
Coming.

30:20.398 --> 30:22.234
Winter is...

30:23.069 --> 30:24.334
[thuds]

30:24.336 --> 30:28.638
Yes! Yes! Yes!

30:28.640 --> 30:30.740
Feel it!

30:30.742 --> 30:33.579
Yes! Yes!

30:34.280 --> 30:35.578
[clanks]

30:35.580 --> 30:37.583
[beeping]

30:39.484 --> 30:41.384
[lock clinks]

30:41.386 --> 30:44.223
And a clown is born.
[chuckles]

30:52.164 --> 30:54.530
What a glorious day.

30:54.532 --> 30:56.301
Glorious, indeed.

30:57.770 --> 30:59.039
That tickled.

31:10.648 --> 31:12.651
[dreamy music]

31:26.764 --> 31:27.800
Hello?

31:28.533 --> 31:29.701
Master Yoga!

31:33.204 --> 31:34.441
This place is a dump.

31:39.444 --> 31:40.579
It's weird.

31:41.713 --> 31:43.146
It almost feels like...

31:43.148 --> 31:44.250
[Master Yoga] Like what?

31:45.483 --> 31:47.284
Who said that?

31:47.286 --> 31:48.885
- I'm right here.
- Oh, god!

31:48.887 --> 31:50.921
Oh! Oh, man!

31:50.923 --> 31:52.192
[sighs]

31:53.158 --> 31:55.491
You must be Master Yoga.

31:55.493 --> 31:57.728
[Bruce] Wow, you're a lot bigger
than I thought you'd be.

31:57.730 --> 31:58.828
And your body is...

31:58.830 --> 32:00.599
Good for you! You're ripped!

32:01.433 --> 32:03.200
Namaste.

32:03.202 --> 32:05.338
[Bruce] Nice to meet you too.
Pleasure.

32:06.838 --> 32:08.739
[screams]

32:08.741 --> 32:09.776
[thuds]

32:11.510 --> 32:13.210
I know.

32:13.212 --> 32:17.181
But we're not here to talk
about my glorious body.

32:17.183 --> 32:20.450
To rescue your son
from Dark Jokester,

32:20.452 --> 32:23.420
you must learn the ways
of the Farce.

32:23.422 --> 32:24.457
Oh.

32:26.224 --> 32:28.491
[Bruce] Everyone keeps talking
about this farce.

32:28.493 --> 32:30.195
I mean, I don't get it.

32:30.963 --> 32:32.429
Farce this.

32:32.431 --> 32:35.199
You gotta do it... what... Okay.

32:35.201 --> 32:37.634
- It is in each one of us.
- I don't think it's in me.

32:37.636 --> 32:41.641
It is the ability to embrace
the naughty or the nice...

32:42.441 --> 32:43.675
in any situation.

32:46.578 --> 32:49.980
But to truly understand
the ways of The Farce,

32:49.982 --> 32:53.252
one must have
the deepest commitment.

32:54.319 --> 32:55.786
Oh, sweet!

32:55.788 --> 32:57.721
Red belt the first day.
I earned this.

32:57.723 --> 32:59.522
- Hey!
- Ow!

32:59.524 --> 33:00.726
You are not ready.

33:01.894 --> 33:03.359
Then why
would you give it to me?

33:03.361 --> 33:06.698
You either do or you do not.

33:09.401 --> 33:12.172
There is no trying, crying,

33:12.937 --> 33:16.306
whining, complaining,

33:16.308 --> 33:18.442
- questioning...
- What time's lunch?

33:18.444 --> 33:19.611
- ...or quitting.
- Okay.

33:20.646 --> 33:21.845
Do you understand?

33:21.847 --> 33:22.882
Yep.

33:25.350 --> 33:27.351
Let's put those things
somewhere safe.

33:27.353 --> 33:28.955
- That...
- [clatters]

33:32.390 --> 33:33.825
I will do whatever it...

33:34.960 --> 33:37.797
First, the toilet you must fix.

33:38.797 --> 33:40.497
The toilet?

33:40.499 --> 33:41.768
No, I'm not the guy.

33:43.469 --> 33:44.934
No questions.

33:44.936 --> 33:48.305
<i>His Naughty training
should begin immediately!</i>

33:48.307 --> 33:50.440
- Yes, my Master.
- <i>And you, Lisp Luther,</i>

33:50.442 --> 33:52.476
<i>is your device operational?</i>

33:52.478 --> 33:54.411
Almost.

33:54.413 --> 33:55.612
The device will be ready soon.

to the successes of your plan.</i>

33:59.318 --> 34:01.317
- <i>What about the girl?</i>
- Oh, you mean my sister?

34:01.319 --> 34:05.455
Uh, she's, uh, a lot stronger
than I anticipated,

34:05.457 --> 34:07.524
- Your Honor.
- She won't be a problem.

34:07.526 --> 34:10.025
I'll see to it myself,
my master.

34:10.027 --> 34:11.726
My master!

34:11.728 --> 34:13.264
<i>Later, haters.</i>

34:19.871 --> 34:22.906
Know your place, Lisp!

You are one minion away
from being my clown trooper.

34:27.478 --> 34:29.045
Dark Lucas,

34:29.047 --> 34:31.417
you ready to begin
your naughty training?

34:32.051 --> 34:33.286
[Jokester] Let's go.

34:38.022 --> 34:39.790
"Let's go, Dark Lucas."

34:57.343 --> 34:58.845
Be at peace.

35:00.745 --> 35:01.814
Now,

35:02.747 --> 35:04.450
tell me about your powers.

35:04.917 --> 35:06.616
Powers?

35:06.618 --> 35:07.920
Really not much to tell.

35:08.854 --> 35:09.787
You know,

35:09.789 --> 35:11.888
I really don't have
too many powers now.

35:11.890 --> 35:15.359
Although recently,
the more angry I get,

35:15.361 --> 35:18.495
I guess the more powerful I am.
I'm getting stronger,

35:18.497 --> 35:20.397
but I mean,
I used to be forgetting.

35:20.399 --> 35:23.466
I was as powerful
as a locomotive.

35:23.468 --> 35:25.535
I, I used to be faster
than a speeding bullet.

35:25.537 --> 35:27.571
I mean, I used to fly. I mean...

35:27.573 --> 35:30.640
Jean and I would fly daily.
Like, every day.

35:30.642 --> 35:32.942
Sometimes,
two, three times a night.

35:32.944 --> 35:36.113
Oh, boy did we fly.

35:36.115 --> 35:39.149
Um, but then, you know,
we had the twins,

35:39.151 --> 35:40.683
and that took up
a lot of her time.

35:40.685 --> 35:43.053
And then, I figured
I'd just fly by myself.

35:43.055 --> 35:44.321
But then you know,
you're up there,

35:44.323 --> 35:46.923
and you're like, uh, I'm just
a weird dude flying by myself.

35:46.925 --> 35:48.658
People looking at me.
Do they feel strange?

35:48.660 --> 35:49.758
I feel strange.

35:49.760 --> 35:53.029
It's a very self-conscious thing
to be flying around,

35:53.031 --> 35:55.631
and no one really notices.
Or are they noticing?

35:55.633 --> 35:57.066
That's the weird thing.

35:57.068 --> 35:58.134
So then you're just like,
forget it.

35:58.136 --> 35:59.669
I'm not going to fly anymore.
But then one day,

35:59.671 --> 36:00.904
I wanted to fly again,

36:00.906 --> 36:03.607
and then, ooh,
I couldn't do it, so...

36:03.609 --> 36:05.478

- [man 1] Maybe.

36:26.497 --> 36:27.964
But aren't you a private eye?

36:27.966 --> 36:29.135
Correction.

36:31.035 --> 36:32.604
I have a private eye.

36:33.539 --> 36:35.040
Oh, hence the eye patch.

36:37.575 --> 36:38.844
Clever lady.

36:40.578 --> 36:41.745
Look, baby girl,

36:41.747 --> 36:44.513
I could find a black cat
in a coal mine,

36:44.515 --> 36:46.651
so my services
are gonna cost you.

36:47.919 --> 36:49.722
So, what do you got
for me today?

36:50.955 --> 36:52.557
Like cash? Right now?

36:54.193 --> 36:57.028
Yes. Like cash. Right now.

Good luck finding your kid.

soon have my daughter.

Please?

37:29.827 --> 37:31.828
Have you talked to Tony Starch?

37:31.830 --> 37:34.763
Maybe he could get
the team together for you.

37:34.765 --> 37:37.167
Let's just say we have
some wrinkles to iron out.

stay put here

that'd be dandy.

from Lando, either.

- Yeah.

They're so beautiful.
Do you want some breakfast?

47:02.332 --> 47:03.368
That sounds great.

47:06.203 --> 47:07.573
Take care of this,
would you, Alfred?

47:09.240 --> 47:11.506
What brings an overgrown rodent
like you to my home?

47:11.508 --> 47:14.109
Yoga doesn't need me
to help you today.

47:14.111 --> 47:15.812
So, I thought
he could help me look for Raya,

47:15.814 --> 47:17.479
and also fix the AC.

47:17.481 --> 47:18.548

[Lisp] Wrong.

48:12.437 --> 48:16.138
You only fulfilled half
of your half of the bargain.

48:16.140 --> 48:18.241
That's only a quarter
of the bargain.

48:18.243 --> 48:20.375
I will fulfill my half
of the bargain

48:20.377 --> 48:23.578
once you complete the whole
of your other half

48:23.580 --> 48:27.850

I'm just trying to get this

This reminds me
of an old saying.

"An eye for an eye leaves
the whole world blind."

48:36.327 --> 48:38.326
[Lisp] But I disagree
with that sentiment.

48:38.328 --> 48:40.729
What I believe is,

48:40.731 --> 48:44.366
"An eye for an eye leaves
the whole world blind,

48:44.368 --> 48:47.870
except for one remaining
one-eyed man."

59:13.229 --> 59:16.298

Let's face it.

59:47.832 --> 59:52.334
He is pure, uncut, raw.

I'm sure there's nothing

Cool.

However...

chiseled out of granite.

01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:12.854
Okay, thank you.
You're not helping.

01:00:12.856 --> 01:00:16.058
You're actually making me feel
much worse about myself.

01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:18.326
Where'd you get
these burritos, too? They stink.

01:00:18.328 --> 01:00:22.263
That is why I got you a present.

01:00:22.265 --> 01:00:24.031
I hope it's not another one
of these burritos.

01:00:24.033 --> 01:00:25.500
And I'm not cleaning
the bathroom again.

Don't even ask.

01:00:27.071 --> 01:00:29.337
Last time,
I should've got hazard pay.

to make that sign back there.

- They're custom.

Or...

01:00:46.022 --> 01:00:50.959
- That's what they told me.
- Wow, this is really nice.

01:00:50.961 --> 01:00:53.227
I mean, when my mother passed,
she gave me her pearls,

01:00:53.229 --> 01:00:55.162
but I've never gotten
a pair of boots before.

01:00:55.164 --> 01:00:56.466
I can promise you...

01:01:19.289 --> 01:01:22.591
Oh, you mean what did Lando Fury
do with Jean?

01:01:22.593 --> 01:01:24.426
I knew I couldn't trust
that guy.

Oh, don't worry.

Now, Dark Jokester,

01:02:06.669 --> 01:02:09.072
it's time
to stop your grinning...

01:02:10.374 --> 01:02:12.406
and drop your linen.

just a little fella, and...

Mm-mm-mm.

01:02:18.582 --> 01:02:19.647
How things have changed.

01:02:19.649 --> 01:02:23.086

That's it?

01:02:51.048 --> 01:02:54.515
Well, that was anticlimactic.

We have Jean and Raya.

01:03:06.330 --> 01:03:08.062
Now give me my damn eye!

01:03:08.064 --> 01:03:09.663
What eye?

01:03:09.665 --> 01:03:11.600
- That one!
- [Lisp] Oh, this eye.

01:03:11.602 --> 01:03:13.100
- [Lando] Yeah.
- This eye right here?

01:03:13.102 --> 01:03:15.973
Oh, this isn't your eye.
This is someone else's.

Aw, nasty.

01:03:17.475 --> 01:03:20.441

01:03:20.443 --> 01:03:24.513
Yeah, I'm a super villain.
It's what we do.

01:03:24.515 --> 01:03:26.214
You're so evil.

01:03:26.216 --> 01:03:28.716
I might be evil,
but I'm also fair.

When I wage my war

01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:34.089
and send this world
into an icy apocalypse,

01:03:34.091 --> 01:03:36.625
I'll allow you
to stand by my side.

01:03:36.627 --> 01:03:38.660
So you won't give me
my eye back,

01:03:38.662 --> 01:03:41.263
and then you threaten
my world with war?

01:03:41.265 --> 01:03:43.365
Soon, you're going to wish
you never betrayed me.

01:03:43.367 --> 01:03:44.598
Ah.

01:20:31.173 --> 01:20:32.339
Well, then, I'll block
