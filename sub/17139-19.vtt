00:03.920 --> 00:05.570
- Hello, brother.
- Kelvin.

00:05.760 --> 00:07.762
- Oh, you remember?
- What are you doing here?

00:07.920 --> 00:09.206
Same reason as you.

00:09.440 --> 00:10.805
So what do you say we help each other out?

00:11.000 --> 00:14.641
You help us track down Kelly Kline,
and you'll be welcomed back into the fold.

00:14.880 --> 00:16.450
And you have the power to do that?

00:16.640 --> 00:18.290
Oh, no, I can't. I'm just the messenger.

00:18.720 --> 00:19.926
But Joshua can.

00:20.160 --> 00:22.447
<i>All we ask is that you hear us.</i>

00:23.800 --> 00:26.201
Come on, Cass.
I've called you three times now.

00:29.120 --> 00:30.281
And you said you were a demon.

00:30.520 --> 00:33.729
I'm a demon, you're Rosemary,
complete with baby.

00:33.960 --> 00:38.443
<i>Kelly, the angels? The Winchesters?
The good guys?</i>

00:38.720 --> 00:39.926
<i>They want you dead.</i>

00:40.120 --> 00:43.124
<i>But I can protect you.
I can protect your son.</i>

00:43.680 --> 00:46.524
Cass, it's me. I've been trying to
get a hold of you for days.

00:47.800 --> 00:49.131
Stay cool and walk with me.

00:49.360 --> 00:50.441
We wanna help.

00:50.640 --> 00:51.721
You call this helping?

00:51.960 --> 00:53.086
She's here.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.651
- You hear anything from Cass yet?
- No, he's still MIA.

01:14.920 --> 01:16.922
- You think he's all right?
- I don't know.

01:17.120 --> 01:21.170
Apparently, Mick let Sam and Dean
get their hands on the bloody Colt.

01:22.160 --> 01:23.685
Welcome back, sweetheart.

01:38.200 --> 01:39.247
DAGON: Hey.

01:39.840 --> 01:40.841
Vitamin time.

01:44.160 --> 01:45.321
Don't.

01:47.520 --> 01:48.567
No.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.484
Be a good girl.

01:58.600 --> 01:59.886
There.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.126
Really, Kel?

02:03.200 --> 02:05.202
<i>Not taking your pills,
picking at your food...</i>

02:06.280 --> 02:07.725
Refusing to bathe?

02:09.880 --> 02:13.043
Stop disrespecting the god inside of you.

02:14.240 --> 02:16.049
He's gonna kill me.

02:16.920 --> 02:18.046
Yeah.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.887
And he's not gonna stop there.

02:22.240 --> 02:26.848
Every sad, weak human,
every tight-ass angel,

02:27.080 --> 02:32.610
every sniveling demon,
they'll all be consumed.

02:34.280 --> 02:35.486
<i>So, go ahead.</i>

02:35.920 --> 02:37.251
<i>Play your games.</i>

02:37.400 --> 02:43.282
But whether you're healthy or sick,
filthy or clean, he will be born.

02:47.120 --> 02:48.531
Good times.

02:50.200 --> 02:52.009
But until then...

02:55.920 --> 02:57.445
Do us both a favor?

02:59.360 --> 03:00.771
Take a bath.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.291
KELLY: <i>I love you.</i>

03:52.320 --> 03:54.527
<i>But we won't ever be together.</i>

03:56.600 --> 03:59.843
<i>There is no happy ending for either of us.</i>

04:00.360 --> 04:02.727
<i>And if what she said is true,</i>

04:03.320 --> 04:05.926
<i>if this is what you really are,</i>

04:06.880 --> 04:09.201
<i>what you'll do to the world,</i>

04:10.240 --> 04:13.608
<i>all that pain, all that death,</i>

04:14.280 --> 04:16.168
I can't let that happen.

04:26.200 --> 04:28.009
I'm sorry.

04:29.200 --> 04:30.531
I'm sorry.

06:04.840 --> 06:05.841
Whoa.

06:07.160 --> 06:08.764
What's up, <i>Beautiful Mind?</i>

06:09.800 --> 06:11.882
Guess I just figured
we can't exactly track Dagon,

06:12.080 --> 06:13.127
so I've been reading up on Nephilim,

06:13.320 --> 06:14.890
trying to figure
how much time we have before...

06:15.080 --> 06:16.764
- 'Lil Lucifer pops?
- Yeah.

06:17.200 --> 06:20.124
Okay, so we know Kelly got pregnant
sometime in early December.

06:20.440 --> 06:24.365
According to the lore, Nephilim don't
need nine months to get to full term,

06:24.560 --> 06:29.566
so I think she will be
giving birth around May 18th.

06:30.040 --> 06:32.281
- Which means...
- We have less than a month to find her.

06:32.480 --> 06:35.211
Yeah, and exactly no idea where to start.

06:35.520 --> 06:38.649
Okay, but even if we do find her,
what then?

06:40.120 --> 06:41.121
I don't know.

06:42.080 --> 06:43.206
I mean, I...

06:47.640 --> 06:48.641
Cass?

06:49.080 --> 06:50.081
Hello.

06:50.560 --> 06:51.561
SAM: <i>Hey.</i>

06:51.920 --> 06:53.365
<i>You're all right. Um...</i>

06:54.280 --> 06:55.406
<i>Where have you been?</i>

06:55.800 --> 06:57.529
Let me rephrase that for Sam.

06:57.840 --> 06:59.490
Where the hell have you been?

06:59.680 --> 07:01.603
And why have you ignored our phone calls?

07:02.840 --> 07:06.162
Where I was, the reception was poor.

07:07.040 --> 07:08.326
No bars?

07:08.640 --> 07:09.641
No bars.

07:09.840 --> 07:11.604
That's his excuse. Wow.

07:11.840 --> 07:14.571
I was in Heaven.
I was working with the angels.

07:18.040 --> 07:22.011
When I saw Dagon had captured Kelly,
I thought they could help.

07:22.240 --> 07:23.321
And?

07:25.280 --> 07:26.281
Nothing.

07:26.920 --> 07:28.684
Well, at least you're back.

07:29.400 --> 07:30.401
We're glad you're back.

07:30.640 --> 07:31.687
Really?

07:33.960 --> 07:34.961
No, I'm sorry.

07:35.200 --> 07:37.931
Okay? 'Cause, while you were
striking out in Heaven,

07:38.120 --> 07:41.124
we had a shot at Dagon, and we lost.

07:42.240 --> 07:44.083
I know. I...

07:44.440 --> 07:45.566
Received your messages.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.001
Oh, you did...
You did receive the messages?

07:47.160 --> 07:48.207
Okay, that's good.

07:48.520 --> 07:50.568
- Dean.
- So, not only were you ditching us,

07:50.840 --> 07:52.604
but you were also ignoring us?

07:52.840 --> 07:54.046
That's great.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.889
'Cause, we really
could've used the backup.

07:58.560 --> 08:02.087
- But you were too busy with...
- What was it?

08:02.360 --> 08:03.521
- Nothing?
- Dean, I...

08:03.720 --> 08:04.926
What the hell is wrong with you, man?

08:08.000 --> 08:09.843
You know, whatever. That's...

08:10.800 --> 08:12.131
Yeah. Welcome back.

08:13.200 --> 08:14.201
Dean...

08:38.360 --> 08:39.407
Sorry, Dean.

08:41.039 --> 08:42.041
Um...

08:44.560 --> 08:47.530
I just wanted to return this.

08:54.640 --> 08:55.721
It's a gift.

08:58.680 --> 08:59.806
You keep those.

09:02.960 --> 09:03.961
Oh.

09:08.480 --> 09:09.481
Cass.

09:09.960 --> 09:11.485
<i>You can't...</i>

09:12.040 --> 09:15.010
With everything that's going on,
you can't just go dark like that.

09:15.560 --> 09:17.085
<i>We didn't know what happened to you.</i>

09:18.440 --> 09:20.010
We were worried. That's not okay.

09:20.480 --> 09:22.482
Well, I didn't mean
to add to your distress.

09:25.480 --> 09:26.481
I...

09:29.320 --> 09:31.846
Dean, I just keep failing.

09:32.720 --> 09:33.926
Again and again.

09:34.160 --> 09:35.161
When you were taken,

09:35.360 --> 09:37.010
I searched for months
and I couldn't find you.

09:37.280 --> 09:39.886
And then Kelly escaped on my watch,
and I couldn't find her.

09:40.160 --> 09:42.561
And I just wanted it...

09:42.880 --> 09:46.566
I needed to come back here
with a win for you.

09:48.600 --> 09:49.726
For myself.

09:50.040 --> 09:52.361
You think you're the only one
rolling snake eyes here?

09:54.720 --> 09:56.449
Me and Sam, we had her.

09:57.200 --> 09:59.009
We had Kelly and we lost her.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.570
And if you find her again?

10:01.840 --> 10:03.080
Sam's working on it.

10:04.680 --> 10:06.045
Of course,
he's hell-bent on finding something

10:06.280 --> 10:09.045
that doesn't mean killing her or her kid.

10:09.360 --> 10:11.681
Right. And if he doesn't find something?

10:12.760 --> 10:14.000
If you run out of time,

10:14.280 --> 10:19.002
could either of you kill an innocent?

10:25.640 --> 10:27.085
We will find a better way.

10:29.520 --> 10:30.567
You mean, we?

10:30.800 --> 10:32.609
Yes, dumb-ass. We.

10:35.720 --> 10:40.851
You, me, and Sam,
we're just better together.

10:41.400 --> 10:44.563
So, now that you're back,
let's go, Team Free Will.

10:46.720 --> 10:48.085
Let's get it done.

10:49.080 --> 10:50.286
I'd like that.

10:51.200 --> 10:52.361
Great.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.081
And I'd like a beer.

11:22.680 --> 11:23.920
What did you do?

11:36.320 --> 11:37.731
He wouldn't let me die.

11:47.480 --> 11:50.484
Hey, come on, man.
Get some sleep, all right?

11:50.680 --> 11:52.045
You're not gonna find Dagon tonight.

11:52.760 --> 11:57.209
Dean, what if we've been going about
this whole thing the wrong way, you know?

11:57.520 --> 12:00.490
I mean, we can't track Dagon, right?

12:00.760 --> 12:03.570
We know that. We've tried.
But what if we can track the Nephilim?

12:06.320 --> 12:07.401
How?

12:09.760 --> 12:10.921
Well...

12:11.600 --> 12:14.683
Okay. The baby's half-angel, right?

12:14.960 --> 12:16.883
So, remember Gadreel?

12:17.160 --> 12:19.845
The psycho angel who took your body
for a test drive? Yeah, what about him?

12:20.160 --> 12:23.369
All right, well, there was this...

12:23.760 --> 12:25.569
There was this spell.
Cass and I were working on it to...

12:25.840 --> 12:27.842
- To find him.
- Yeah, but it didn't work.

12:28.680 --> 12:30.091
- Yeah.
<i>- You needed Gadreel's grace,</i>

12:30.320 --> 12:31.526
and he couldn't yank enough out of you.

12:33.320 --> 12:34.924
Of course.

12:35.520 --> 12:36.760
"Of course" what?

12:37.160 --> 12:38.764
Of course I am an idiot.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.480
- Well, there's no argument there.
- No, stop. Dean.

12:42.320 --> 12:43.890
The grace extraction.

12:45.520 --> 12:47.921
The tracking spell was a bust, right?

12:48.200 --> 12:50.680
But the extraction ritual worked.

12:50.960 --> 12:53.566
- So?
- So, what if Cass used it on Kelly's kid?

12:54.120 --> 12:57.488
I mean, a Nephilim's just
a human soul with angelic grace, right?

12:57.760 --> 12:58.966
So, you remove the grace...

12:59.200 --> 13:00.929
- Kid's just a kid.
- Kid's just a kid.

13:01.360 --> 13:04.284
That way, Kelly wouldn't have to die,
and neither would her baby.

13:08.040 --> 13:09.405
- Hot damn.
- Hot damn.

13:09.840 --> 13:11.922
I mean, we still obviously
have to find Kelly in the first place,

13:12.160 --> 13:14.891
- and it's just a theory, but...
- No, no, no. That's...

13:16.000 --> 13:17.001
This is it.

13:18.160 --> 13:19.207
This is it, Sam.

13:19.720 --> 13:20.721
I'll get Cass.

13:23.720 --> 13:24.721
Cass?

13:26.200 --> 13:27.725
Yo, Cass!

13:45.640 --> 13:48.086
You really thought that was gonna work?

13:49.000 --> 13:52.891
You get the chance
to be Mary of Nazareth, Part 2.

13:53.120 --> 13:54.884
Evil Jesus Edition.

13:55.080 --> 13:56.081
He's not.

13:56.240 --> 13:58.004
- Excuse me?
- He's not.

13:58.280 --> 14:00.362
My baby's not evil. He saved me.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.045
That's what you think happened?

14:04.880 --> 14:06.928
He saved himself.

14:07.880 --> 14:10.042
He doesn't care about you.

14:10.440 --> 14:11.851
Nothing's changed.

14:12.200 --> 14:14.771
He's born, you die.

14:17.440 --> 14:18.965
But don't worry.

14:19.440 --> 14:21.761
I'll be there, right by his side,

14:22.000 --> 14:27.962
to nurture him, love him,
to help him to kill...

14:29.520 --> 14:30.760
Everything.

14:32.080 --> 14:35.687
You know, like a mother should.

14:56.640 --> 14:58.210
Hello, brother.

14:58.520 --> 14:59.521
Is it done?

15:02.640 --> 15:03.641
Yes.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.001
Bullets?

15:10.360 --> 15:14.126
There were only two in the chamber,
and I couldn't exactly ask for more.

15:14.960 --> 15:16.200
It's enough.

15:16.680 --> 15:18.682
- One for Dagon?
- Yeah.

15:19.640 --> 15:20.721
One for Kelly.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.685
- They're close.
- The celestial pulse we felt,

15:27.120 --> 15:29.043
Joshua tracked it to a house nearby.

15:39.600 --> 15:41.204
You're doing the right thing, you know.

15:41.440 --> 15:45.570
Committing to Joshua's plan,
putting angelkind above the Winchesters.

15:45.960 --> 15:47.689
I mean, your reputation in Heaven is...

15:47.880 --> 15:50.724
This has nothing to do with my reputation.

15:50.960 --> 15:53.008
I am doing this for the Winchesters.

15:53.360 --> 15:57.001
I stole the Colt
to keep them out of this mission

15:57.200 --> 15:58.850
and to keep them safe from Dagon.

15:59.040 --> 16:00.041
And I...

16:01.920 --> 16:03.729
I will kill this girl...

16:05.040 --> 16:07.202
So that Sam and Dean don't have to.

16:09.800 --> 16:10.801
Hozai.

16:11.440 --> 16:12.441
Castiel.

16:12.720 --> 16:15.564
Dagon, the girl, they're in the house.

16:17.840 --> 16:18.887
Showtime.

16:31.680 --> 16:32.886
HOST: <i>And now
we've got five seconds</i>

16:33.080 --> 16:34.605
<i>to see more of the Super Catchphrase</i>

16:34.920 --> 16:36.763
<i>and win the bank. Here we go.</i>

16:42.640 --> 16:45.450
<i>Cindy, for $350, tell us what it is.</i>

16:45.720 --> 16:46.960
CINDY: <i>Pumping iron?</i>

16:47.240 --> 16:48.241
HOST: <i>Not right.</i>

16:48.680 --> 16:50.444
Chip and Cindy...

16:50.840 --> 16:52.763
<i>Got a lot of people in the audience
who think they know,</i>

16:53.000 --> 16:54.843
<i>but we have a Toss-Up Catchphrase for you.</i>

16:59.320 --> 17:00.845
<i>Now, your opponent knows,
but she can't guess.</i>

17:01.400 --> 17:02.606
<i>It's only you who are entitled.</i>

17:02.880 --> 17:04.450
<i>There's $400 in the bank.</i>

17:04.720 --> 17:06.404
<i>- Chip, what is it?</i>
- CHIP: <i>The Iron Curtain!</i>

17:06.640 --> 17:08.722
HOST: <i>No!</i>

17:08.960 --> 17:10.040
CHIP: <i>Yes!</i>

17:18.160 --> 17:21.800
HOST: <i>I got so excited there myself
that I went to the opposite thing.</i>

17:22.160 --> 17:23.685
DAGON: <i>Well, whatcha know?</i>

17:35.040 --> 17:36.451
Hey, find the girl.

17:57.240 --> 17:58.401
Castiel?

18:17.720 --> 18:19.324
CASTIEL: <i>This is my voicemail.</i>

18:19.600 --> 18:21.602
<i>Make your voice a mail.</i>

18:25.680 --> 18:26.761
Let me guess. No answer?

18:27.000 --> 18:30.243
I mean, how did Cass even get the Colt
out of the safe in the first place?

18:33.040 --> 18:35.805
Dean, you...
You put the Colt back in the safe, right?

18:36.480 --> 18:37.481
Dean?

18:37.720 --> 18:38.721
It was under my pillow.

18:38.960 --> 18:40.644
- It...
- I like to keep it close.

18:41.720 --> 18:43.370
He came into my room and he played me.

18:43.680 --> 18:44.681
Yeah, he played us both.

18:44.920 --> 18:47.207
Well, I say we find him
and we kick his feathered ass.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.246
Dean, Cass wouldn't have taken the Colt

18:49.560 --> 18:50.891
if he wasn't
going up against something big.

18:51.160 --> 18:52.844
Okay, I say we find him,
figure out what's going on,

18:53.040 --> 18:54.405
and then we kick his feathered ass.

19:03.880 --> 19:05.803
Guess you finally caught me.

19:08.880 --> 19:11.451
Back there in the basement...

19:13.560 --> 19:15.050
You came to kill me.

19:23.320 --> 19:24.526
But you didn't.

19:30.760 --> 19:31.807
Thank you.

19:32.120 --> 19:33.326
Please don't thank me.

19:34.520 --> 19:36.363
I had a mission and I failed.

19:42.440 --> 19:43.521
And now?

19:44.240 --> 19:45.730
Now, I don't know.

19:47.280 --> 19:50.762
I'm just trying to put as much distance
between you and Dagon as I can.

19:51.760 --> 19:53.091
Everything's fine.

19:54.600 --> 19:56.967
Just put the container down for a nap.

19:57.200 --> 19:58.440
LUCIFER: <i>Did you?</i>

19:59.360 --> 20:00.361
<i>Dagon...</i>

20:01.560 --> 20:04.166
I know you're lying to me.

20:06.080 --> 20:07.127
What happened?

20:07.640 --> 20:10.450
- My Lord, I...
- Tell me.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.483
Look, I...

20:17.880 --> 20:19.006
The angels...

20:19.640 --> 20:20.687
They found us.

20:24.960 --> 20:26.007
One of them took her.

20:27.640 --> 20:28.641
Which one?

20:29.400 --> 20:31.209
Castiel.

20:36.320 --> 20:39.164
Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

20:39.480 --> 20:44.008
So you let the Winchesters' purse dog
take my son?

20:53.200 --> 20:54.326
I didn't...

20:56.920 --> 20:57.921
I will find them.

20:58.160 --> 21:01.528
Yes, you will,
or that little fantasy of yours,

21:01.760 --> 21:05.401
ruling Heaven and Earth, you, me,
baby makes three...

21:05.600 --> 21:08.365
It's not a fantasy.
That was your promise to me.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.968
Here's another promise for you.
Find my boy,

21:12.360 --> 21:17.605
or the torments I will visit upon you
will be infinite.

21:18.680 --> 21:19.727
Promise.

21:23.040 --> 21:24.883
You make this right, Dagon.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.531
Make it right.

21:27.800 --> 21:28.881
I will.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.210
What's going on?

21:54.520 --> 21:56.522
I was communicating with Joshua.

21:58.360 --> 21:59.600
He's an angel. I...

22:01.000 --> 22:02.411
I was getting my orders.

22:05.360 --> 22:06.930
I couldn't kill you back there.

22:07.800 --> 22:11.122
But now, I will take you to Heaven.

22:11.600 --> 22:14.365
Your life will end, and your baby's, too.

22:14.600 --> 22:17.171
- It'll be swift and painless...
- No.

22:18.320 --> 22:20.800
No, you don't know...

22:23.840 --> 22:25.001
What if it doesn't work?

22:25.320 --> 22:28.767
No human form
can step through that gate and survive.

22:30.040 --> 22:32.884
Your souls, they'll ascend to Heaven,

22:33.480 --> 22:37.565
and every cell of your beings
will return to the universe.

22:41.120 --> 22:42.849
<i>I am sorry, Kelly.</i>

22:43.760 --> 22:45.603
<i>He's the son of Lucifer.</i>

22:46.200 --> 22:49.443
This is a human-archangel hybrid.

22:51.280 --> 22:54.921
That power, it's beyond comprehension.

22:55.120 --> 22:59.648
Your child could
bring the universe to its knees.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.962
Or lift it to its feet.

23:04.960 --> 23:07.930
<i>This baby, nothing is born evil.</i>

23:08.440 --> 23:10.329
I can't take that chance.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.371
None of us can.

23:29.640 --> 23:30.641
I don't know.

23:31.160 --> 23:32.161
Right.

23:32.400 --> 23:35.483
Suicide mission, no contingencies...
Blah, blah, blah.

23:37.880 --> 23:38.927
I believe you.

23:39.760 --> 23:41.489
You don't know where Castiel is.

23:41.720 --> 23:45.008
But he's an angel, you're an angel.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.641
Got a feeling, ya dig deep enough,

23:50.040 --> 23:52.441
you can make an excellent guess.

23:53.240 --> 23:54.571
Why would I tell you?

23:55.680 --> 24:00.527
You're just Lucifer's
desperate, clingy side piece.

24:04.320 --> 24:06.891
'Cause being Lucifer's side piece...

24:08.360 --> 24:09.521
Has its perks.

24:13.880 --> 24:14.881
Now think.

24:15.880 --> 24:17.041
Where's he going?

24:19.760 --> 24:22.570
WWCD.

24:22.920 --> 24:25.002
"What would Castiel do?"

24:31.880 --> 24:34.963
You need to keep out of sight
until I can get us back on the road.

24:40.840 --> 24:43.207
I'm thirsty. I just want...

24:43.440 --> 24:45.966
Just sit.

25:05.120 --> 25:06.884
Something happened to me, Castiel.

25:12.080 --> 25:14.765
I lost hope. I tried to...

25:17.320 --> 25:18.606
I killed myself.

25:23.200 --> 25:24.486
I slit my wrists.

25:30.440 --> 25:31.726
I died.

25:33.880 --> 25:35.041
And then...

25:37.680 --> 25:39.170
He saved me.

25:42.400 --> 25:43.811
He brought me back to life.

25:47.080 --> 25:48.650
Well, that was the pulse.

25:50.680 --> 25:51.886
We felt that in Heaven.

25:52.120 --> 25:53.360
His power...

25:54.840 --> 25:59.880
His soul surged through me,
and it was good.

26:01.240 --> 26:03.322
Pure. I feel...

26:03.960 --> 26:06.804
I know he is good.

26:07.400 --> 26:08.526
Kelly...

26:10.480 --> 26:13.324
What your child did,
that's a testament to his power,

26:13.560 --> 26:16.131
but it's not proof of some goodness.

26:16.840 --> 26:18.285
He needs you alive.

26:20.240 --> 26:21.241
Maybe.

26:23.840 --> 26:25.171
Or maybe it was a miracle.

26:27.320 --> 26:28.321
<i>Maybe...</i>

26:28.640 --> 26:30.688
<i>Maybe everything that I've been through,</i>

26:30.920 --> 26:32.843
<i>everything that
I still have to go through,</i>

26:33.520 --> 26:37.002
is happening for a reason. Maybe...

26:37.840 --> 26:39.604
It's part of some plan.

26:39.840 --> 26:41.126
No, it isn't.

26:43.680 --> 26:48.527
I used to believe in a plan.

26:49.040 --> 26:51.691
I used to believe that I had some mission.

26:52.880 --> 26:57.568
But I have been through enough now
to know that everyone is just winging it.

26:59.320 --> 27:00.765
Some of us quite badly.

27:02.000 --> 27:05.049
Lucifer, he's just breaking toys.

27:05.280 --> 27:11.049
He's sowing destruction and chaos,
and there is no grand purpose at work.

27:11.560 --> 27:14.643
And there's no special role for you.

27:14.880 --> 27:16.882
When Lucifer took over Rooney's body...

27:18.240 --> 27:19.241
I'm sorry.

27:20.400 --> 27:22.801
You were just there.

27:29.440 --> 27:31.920
I know my baby can be good for this world.

27:32.160 --> 27:34.242
Kelly, if he's born...

27:36.600 --> 27:38.568
That is not something you can survive.

27:40.400 --> 27:42.289
So, even if you are right,

27:42.760 --> 27:45.127
and even if the worst isn't inevitable,

27:46.440 --> 27:50.411
then who will care for him
when you're gone?

27:52.280 --> 27:53.281
Who?

27:53.760 --> 27:58.891
Who is strong enough to protect him
and to keep him from evil influences

27:59.320 --> 28:01.607
and to keep him on the righteous path?

28:07.280 --> 28:08.281
What?

28:08.720 --> 28:10.848
He just... He just kicked.

28:12.760 --> 28:13.966
Do you want to...

28:14.960 --> 28:16.121
Oh, no.

28:16.520 --> 28:20.047
It's not a big deal, Castiel.
He does it, like, 20 times a day.

28:36.760 --> 28:37.807
You stay away from her.

28:44.040 --> 28:45.041
Kelly?

28:57.120 --> 28:58.963
Yeah, that's mine.

29:04.240 --> 29:05.480
What the hell are you thinking, huh?

29:05.800 --> 29:07.211
- Dean?
- What?

29:07.480 --> 29:08.641
Dean!

29:16.600 --> 29:17.601
Kelly?

29:20.000 --> 29:21.365
- Hey.-
- Hey.-

29:21.720 --> 29:22.846
How did you find us?

29:24.680 --> 29:26.284
Well, while you were
scamming me for the Colt,

29:26.520 --> 29:28.045
Sam put a tracking app on your phone.

29:30.160 --> 29:32.845
Cass, when you came back,
you didn't even look us in the eye.

29:34.040 --> 29:35.530
You wanna explain what's going on here?

29:36.400 --> 29:37.640
Yeah. I found Dagon.

29:37.800 --> 29:38.801
- And?
- Did you kill her?

29:39.000 --> 29:40.923
No, but...

29:41.560 --> 29:43.369
She's difficult to kill, okay?

29:43.640 --> 29:45.130
- Yeah.
- You think?

29:47.440 --> 29:49.522
All right, so what
are you doing here, then?

29:50.040 --> 29:51.041
I...

29:52.800 --> 29:54.211
My truck broke down.

29:55.680 --> 29:57.887
Then why didn't you call us?
Cass, we could've helped you.

29:58.120 --> 30:01.203
I know. I wanted to keep you out of this.

30:01.520 --> 30:02.760
I was trying to keep you safe.

30:03.040 --> 30:04.690
You're not our babysitter, Cass, okay?

30:04.880 --> 30:06.291
That is not your job.

30:06.800 --> 30:09.007
And when in our whole lives
have we ever been safe?

30:09.280 --> 30:12.727
This is my responsibility,
because it is my plan.

30:12.960 --> 30:13.961
Your plan?

30:15.080 --> 30:16.206
He's taking me to Heaven.

30:16.400 --> 30:17.401
You...

30:18.080 --> 30:19.286
You're taking her to the sandbox?

30:21.040 --> 30:22.041
Yes.

30:22.840 --> 30:24.888
I'm ending this, once and for all.

30:25.120 --> 30:27.202
Kelly and her baby have to die.

30:27.400 --> 30:28.845
No, they don't. Listen.

30:29.160 --> 30:30.400
We found another way.

30:30.640 --> 30:32.369
And you would know that
if you would answer your phone.

30:32.640 --> 30:33.846
Wait, what are you talking about?

30:34.080 --> 30:36.128
What you did with me,
with Gadreel, remember?

30:36.400 --> 30:39.290
The... The grace extraction.
We take the grace from the baby,

30:39.600 --> 30:40.965
from the Nephilim,
and then the baby just becomes...

30:41.160 --> 30:42.241
- Human.
- Human.

30:42.480 --> 30:44.926
Wait a minute.
That extraction, it nearly killed you.

30:45.160 --> 30:46.924
- Yeah, but it didn't.
- Because we didn't finish it.

30:47.240 --> 30:48.241
We don't even know if this would work.

30:48.440 --> 30:50.966
There are kinks, yes, but it's a plan.

30:51.520 --> 30:53.284
And it beats
the hell out of certain death.

30:55.440 --> 30:56.441
Am I right?

31:00.080 --> 31:01.161
No.

31:04.160 --> 31:06.606
Hey, Kelly. Kelly.
Hey, wait, wait. Wait a second, look.

31:06.920 --> 31:08.570
We can't imagine
what you've been through, okay?

31:08.800 --> 31:10.325
But we promised we'd find another way,
and we did.

31:10.520 --> 31:13.091
- We found a better way. This can work.
- I'm going with Castiel.

31:13.280 --> 31:16.727
No, Kelly, if you go with Cass, you die.
Your baby dies.

31:16.960 --> 31:18.803
I go with you, you take away
the thing that makes him special.

31:18.960 --> 31:20.121
How does that matter if you're both dead?

31:20.280 --> 31:21.281
That's the only thing that matters.

31:21.480 --> 31:22.845
- This girl has lost her mind.
- CASTIEL: Hey, Dean...

31:23.080 --> 31:24.684
SAM: Meanwhile, can we
take this conversation elsewhere?

31:24.920 --> 31:26.729
Guys, we're kind of
sitting ducks out here.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.321
Sam's right. Dagon is after Kelly.
Your truck is broke down.

31:29.520 --> 31:31.568
Why don't we get in the Impala,
we'll head back to the bunker,

31:31.800 --> 31:33.643
- and we'll talk? We'll figure it out.
- Right.

31:38.480 --> 31:39.606
Okay, we'll talk.

31:40.320 --> 31:41.481
- Great.
- Great.

31:41.720 --> 31:43.324
- It's like herding cats.
- Yeah.

31:44.480 --> 31:46.209
Okay, so what? We go back to the bunker

31:46.480 --> 31:49.006
and we just try to
convince them to stay there forever?

31:49.280 --> 31:50.361
- Dean.
- No...

31:50.600 --> 31:51.601
it's locked.

32:12.040 --> 32:14.281
It's not supposed to happen this way.

32:26.520 --> 32:27.760
CASTIEL: <i>Kelly.</i>

32:28.640 --> 32:29.641
What are you doing?

32:31.200 --> 32:33.123
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey, hey!

32:41.120 --> 32:42.929
Turn around.

32:43.160 --> 32:44.889
- Where are you going?
- To Heaven.

32:45.520 --> 32:48.603
The sandbox,
if you tell me how to get there.

32:48.960 --> 32:51.531
Kelly, I can make you stop this car.

32:52.040 --> 32:53.121
Why haven't you?

32:54.240 --> 32:56.004
Okay, why are you doing this?

32:56.560 --> 32:58.847
Because he chose you, Castiel.

33:00.240 --> 33:04.086
When you put your hand on my stomach,
I heard him. He spoke to me.

33:04.320 --> 33:08.530
He told me that even if it seems scary,
if I just went to the gate,

33:09.120 --> 33:12.090
if I just followed your plan,

33:12.920 --> 33:14.809
that you would make sure he was born.

33:17.680 --> 33:21.765
Sam and Dean, they want to take away
his powers because they're scared.

33:23.040 --> 33:24.724
- But I'm not.
- Kelly, you...

33:24.920 --> 33:28.561
You asked me who would protect him,
guide him when I'm gone.

33:28.760 --> 33:29.761
I know now.

33:31.720 --> 33:32.881
It's you.

33:33.560 --> 33:35.085
Me? That's...

33:36.080 --> 33:37.081
I...

33:37.600 --> 33:42.766
I am not someone
that you should put your faith in, Kelly.

33:44.080 --> 33:46.128
I couldn't kill Dagon back there.

33:46.480 --> 33:50.644
I lost two of my men.
I betrayed my friends, my family.

33:50.960 --> 33:52.200
KELLY: <i>Before all this happened,</i>

33:52.400 --> 33:54.926
I was a cut-rate political flack

33:55.160 --> 33:59.449
in an embarrassingly unprofessional
relationship with my boss.

34:02.280 --> 34:04.123
I don't know why it's me.

34:05.880 --> 34:07.166
And I don't know why it's you.

34:07.440 --> 34:11.126
But I know that
we are destined for something here.

34:12.520 --> 34:13.806
Something great.

34:14.960 --> 34:16.803
Well, I wish I had your faith.

34:18.679 --> 34:19.761
You will.

34:28.639 --> 34:30.085
SAM: How did this happen?

34:30.360 --> 34:32.328
What, the lying? The Heaven plan?

34:32.520 --> 34:34.409
Or the fact that
I'm working on this stupid truck?

34:34.639 --> 34:36.529
No, I mean, what's wrong with Cass?

34:37.199 --> 34:39.009
Well, he hasn't exactly had a banner year.

34:39.239 --> 34:44.041
I mean, think about it.
Between Lucifer, killing Billie, Ramiel,

34:44.760 --> 34:45.966
everything's been blowing up in his face.

34:46.159 --> 34:48.766
And he's so desperate for a win right now,
he can't even see straight.

34:49.159 --> 34:50.525
Go ahead and give it a try.

35:10.040 --> 35:11.166
This is it?

35:11.360 --> 35:12.600
This is it.

35:14.520 --> 35:16.045
Kelly, are you sure?

35:17.600 --> 35:18.601
Yeah.

35:20.040 --> 35:22.520
As long as you're here,
I know it's gonna be okay.

35:40.560 --> 35:41.721
Castiel.

35:42.040 --> 35:43.087
Kelly.

35:43.600 --> 35:44.601
It's good to see you.

35:45.120 --> 35:46.121
Hello, Joshua.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.570
I know you must be scared.

35:55.200 --> 35:56.201
But don't be.

35:59.640 --> 36:00.721
Ugh.

36:01.920 --> 36:03.046
Hey, girl.

36:04.720 --> 36:05.767
Wow!

36:06.040 --> 36:08.008
You two got so close!

36:08.520 --> 36:12.650
If I hadn't made it here
at the last possible second...

36:14.240 --> 36:18.802
JK. Flipped your pal Kelvin ages ago,
then smoked him.

36:21.400 --> 36:23.323
I've been here for hours.

36:24.040 --> 36:25.451
You stay away from her.

36:25.880 --> 36:27.120
What, no Colt?

36:28.120 --> 36:29.121
Wait.

36:29.400 --> 36:31.767
You don't even have it anymore?

36:32.440 --> 36:33.487
Hilarious.

36:43.440 --> 36:46.489
Look at him, your angelic defender.

36:47.800 --> 36:50.007
You really thought he was gonna save you?

36:50.840 --> 36:54.765
This sad, fluttering, aimless little moth?

36:55.840 --> 36:56.841
No.

37:23.320 --> 37:24.321
Yeah.

37:24.520 --> 37:27.490
Time to take this off the board.

37:30.240 --> 37:31.401
No!

37:38.480 --> 37:39.561
Okay.

37:39.920 --> 37:41.445
Who wants ice cream?

37:49.000 --> 37:52.163
Oh, kid, come on. It's just getting sad.

37:54.640 --> 37:55.687
Run.

38:07.040 --> 38:08.121
Aw!

38:08.360 --> 38:10.362
Adorbs!

38:25.120 --> 38:26.406
- Cass!
- No!

38:33.600 --> 38:34.681
How...

38:37.160 --> 38:38.810
Call it a miracle.

39:15.840 --> 39:16.921
Cass?

39:18.520 --> 39:19.601
What was that?

39:20.120 --> 39:21.645
It was...

39:22.400 --> 39:23.447
It was me.

39:25.680 --> 39:27.284
But it was also...

39:33.480 --> 39:34.481
You're hurt.

39:45.080 --> 39:47.287
Thank you for coming to fight for us.

39:47.880 --> 39:49.882
- Are you okay?
- I am.

39:52.800 --> 39:54.484
I've been so lost.

39:57.320 --> 39:58.651
I'm not lost anymore.

39:59.120 --> 40:04.763
And I know now that this child
must be born with all of his power.

40:05.080 --> 40:06.889
You can't actually mean that.

40:07.160 --> 40:08.161
Yes.

40:08.640 --> 40:10.483
I do. I have faith.

40:16.240 --> 40:17.321
<i>We have to go.</i>

40:19.440 --> 40:22.364
Hey, Cass, wait a second.
Wait, hold on. Just...

40:23.720 --> 40:25.131
You have to just trust me.

40:25.440 --> 40:26.680
No, no, no, wait. Okay...

40:26.960 --> 40:29.361
Whatever that thing did to you,
we're not just gonna let you walk away.

40:29.560 --> 40:32.131
- Yeah, that's not gonna happen.
- Yes, it is.

40:33.040 --> 40:34.041
You...

40:34.560 --> 40:35.561
Don't.

40:38.880 --> 40:40.086
I'm sorry.

41:05.320 --> 41:08.005
- What did he tell you?
- He didn't tell me.

41:08.720 --> 41:10.131
He showed me.

41:11.920 --> 41:13.126
The future.
