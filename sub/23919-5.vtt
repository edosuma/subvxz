Okay, hold on, son.

01:02.018 --> 01:03.759
What type of petty person

Um, the usual.

01:15.162 --> 01:17.990
No. Course not.

01:18.034 --> 01:20.210
She don't be thinking
about nothing else, either.

01:20.254 --> 01:22.038
With that fine ass,

01:22.082 --> 01:23.561
You know what I'm saying?
It's all good.

01:23.605 --> 01:25.694
When I get my income tax,

01:25.737 --> 01:29.176
or-or I'm-a buy my own
WNBA team, one of those...

01:29.219 --> 01:30.394
-Yo, Bibby.

01:30.438 --> 01:32.396
-Hey, man, let me let you go.

01:32.440 --> 01:34.398
I got somebody
sitting in the chair.

01:34.442 --> 01:36.792
Yeah, he's a little hostile.
I got to jet. I'll let you go.

01:36.835 --> 01:39.534
Yeah, it's gonna probably take

01:39.577 --> 01:42.406

Sorry about that, man. So what'd

01:54.375 --> 01:56.203

01:56.246 --> 01:57.813
-All right, then,
the usual it is. -Yeah.

01:57.856 --> 02:01.338
Hey. Let me ask you a question.
Did you see the news last night?

02:01.382 --> 02:03.862
Them savages from Atlanta that
went into that T-Mobile store,

02:03.906 --> 02:05.603
drove they car in there,

02:05.647 --> 02:07.997
-got away with about 100 phones.
-Yeah, man. It's crazy out here.

02:08.040 --> 02:10.173
I mean, it's-it's that time
of year though, I guess.

02:10.217 --> 02:11.827
Yeah. Crazy.

02:11.870 --> 02:13.437
Hey, yo, and that reminds me,
listen.

02:13.481 --> 02:15.570
If you know somebody
that needs a iPhone,

02:15.613 --> 02:17.267
tell them to holla at me
if they with T-Mobile.

02:17.311 --> 02:19.226
-I got the hookup on the low.
-Got you, man.

02:19.269 --> 02:20.401
-I appreciate that.
-All right.

02:20.444 --> 02:22.185
So what we doing now?

02:22.229 --> 02:24.579
Like I said, man, the usual.

02:24.622 --> 02:26.233
All right, the usual, damn.

02:26.276 --> 02:27.408
Usual, gonna have the usual.

02:27.451 --> 02:29.453
You don't want to do
nothing different?

02:29.497 --> 02:31.629
No, man. Look, I got, I got
a photo shoot coming up, man.

02:31.673 --> 02:33.457
-So I just... want to look good.
-Oh!

02:33.501 --> 02:34.893
Oh, you got a photo shoot
coming up.

02:34.937 --> 02:37.287
-Yeah, man. I mean...

02:37.331 --> 02:38.593
Nah, man. It's just a write-up
for me in a magazine.

02:38.636 --> 02:39.985
Yeah. My boy done
went all Hollywood.

02:40.029 --> 02:41.073
It's a write-up in a magazine,

02:41.117 --> 02:42.205
and they want
to take some pictures,

02:42.249 --> 02:43.859
so that's-that's what I'm doing.

02:43.902 --> 02:46.078
Hey, you dating Kim Kardashian
now

02:46.122 --> 02:48.211
-No, Bibby, man. -My boy done
went straight Hollywood on me.

02:48.255 --> 02:49.865
-That's good, though.
-It ain't no Hollywood, Bibby.

02:49.908 --> 02:51.301
-I ain't going
no Hollywood, man.

02:51.345 --> 02:53.303
You know what, that reminds me,
as a matter of fact,

02:53.347 --> 02:55.087
I'm glad you brought
that Hollywood shit up.

02:55.131 --> 02:58.047
Me and my girl snuck in the AMC
the other day, see a movie.

02:58.090 --> 03:00.049
We was looking at
the movie posters on the wall,

03:00.092 --> 03:02.225
and guess how many movie posters
they got on there

03:02.269 --> 03:04.227
with black people on them.

03:04.271 --> 03:06.838
-Guess!
-One.

03:06.882 --> 03:08.275
-Zero!
-Zero.

03:08.318 --> 03:09.406
It's sad, man.

03:09.450 --> 03:11.713
Key and Peele put a movie out
with a cat in it,

03:11.756 --> 03:13.323
they put the cat on the poster.

03:13.367 --> 03:14.890
They dressed the cat up
like a nigga instead of

03:14.933 --> 03:16.674
putting two niggas that made
the movie on the poster.

03:16.718 --> 03:18.894
So was it a cat in a suit
or just looked like a nigga?

03:18.937 --> 03:20.330
It was...
You know, you know a cat,

03:20.374 --> 03:21.288
what a, what a nigga cat
look like!

03:21.331 --> 03:22.463
Okay. All right, man. I got it.

03:22.506 --> 03:24.508
-It's fucked up. I know.
-It is.

03:24.552 --> 03:26.423
Shit's nuts out here. I'm glad
somebody agree with me.

03:26.467 --> 03:28.251
See, that's why I like you.
You smart.

03:28.295 --> 03:31.515
Smarter than a lot of them.
Why I like you.

03:35.302 --> 03:37.173
Oh, you got somewhere to be?

03:37.217 --> 03:39.306
-Yes! Bibby, man. Yeah, I said
that, man. -Oh, shit, my bad.

03:39.349 --> 03:41.482
-Hey, I didn't know. My bad.
Hey. -Just...

03:41.525 --> 03:44.267
-Hey, no big deal,
baby. Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

03:44.311 --> 03:45.921
No big deal.
You should've said that.

03:45.964 --> 03:48.097
-All right, man. We good.
-I'll get you squared away.

03:48.140 --> 03:49.751
-Oh, shit.
Don't worry about that.

03:49.794 --> 03:51.318
Don't worry.
That ain't nothing.

03:51.361 --> 03:55.322
Yeah, I got the cut, the usual.
Uh-huh.

03:55.365 --> 03:57.541
Get you ready for Hollywood.

03:57.585 --> 04:00.501
That reminds me, hey, did you
see that basketball player

04:00.544 --> 04:02.938

the club in that invisible car?

04:02.981 --> 04:04.287
-That shit on YouTube.
-Yeah, man.

04:04.331 --> 04:06.289
-I-I know about it.
-That is the funniest vi...

04:06.333 --> 04:08.552
You got to see this shit.

04:08.596 --> 04:10.337
-Yeah, man.
-Shit here is funny.

04:10.380 --> 04:12.339
But I ain't got to,

04:12.382 --> 04:13.557
Uh-uh. You got to watch this.

04:13.601 --> 04:14.776
You need to watch this,
trust me.

04:14.819 --> 04:17.126
-Yeah, watch that right quick.

04:17.169 --> 04:18.910
I'm-a use the bathroom, though.

04:18.954 --> 04:21.217
-Let me just...

04:24.612 --> 04:26.527
Hey, Bibby, man. Somebody...

04:26.570 --> 04:28.311
Somebody calling

Raindrops, peach emoji?

04:32.402 --> 04:34.361
Hello

04:34.404 --> 04:36.450
Uh-uh. Don't do that.
Don't go through that. Hello?

04:36.493 --> 04:39.322
Baby, baby, baby,

04:39.366 --> 04:41.977

04:43.848 --> 04:45.981

05:01.388 --> 05:02.954
-Come on.
-Bibby, I ain't going...

05:02.998 --> 05:04.347

05:14.314 --> 05:15.619
You trying to go

Oh, goddamn.

05:37.598 --> 05:39.600

05:43.865 --> 05:46.998
Hey, fam, what your cable

05:47.042 --> 05:49.044
-Yeah, your cable.

05:49.087 --> 05:51.263
'Cause, listen,
I'm with Clear Cable now.

05:51.307 --> 05:53.004
I'm working with them
on the side.

05:53.048 --> 05:55.659
So if you sign up with me, I'll
make sure you're taken care of.

05:55.703 --> 05:57.661
-You know what I'm talking
about? -I'm straight, Bibby.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.624
Well, fine.
Do this for me, then.

06:03.667 --> 06:05.582
Take these business cards,
pass them out at your show

06:05.626 --> 06:07.279
or take them to a studio
or something.

06:07.323 --> 06:09.064
Throw them at the crowd,
whatever you got to do.

06:09.107 --> 06:11.545
Make sure you pick up
my loosies, though,

06:11.588 --> 06:13.634
'cause them ain't cheap.

06:13.677 --> 06:16.680
"Klear Cable." With a "K."

06:16.724 --> 06:18.943
Clever, right?

06:21.555 --> 06:23.252
Toothpick?

06:23.295 --> 06:24.688
50 cent.

06:24.732 --> 06:26.298
I'm good, man.

06:26.342 --> 06:28.300
â™ª

06:48.103 --> 06:51.715
Hey. Yo, my man. Hey.
Where your mom at, boy?

06:51.759 --> 06:53.238
Where your...?
Oh, baby, I'm here!

06:53.282 --> 06:54.588
You a hour late.
Come on, Omari.

06:54.631 --> 06:55.893
Hour late?
What you talking about?

06:55.937 --> 06:57.329
Let's go.
We're going. Let's go.

06:57.373 --> 06:59.070
-Come on. -Wait, baby.
Calm down. Calm down.

06:59.114 --> 07:00.550
Bibby, I ain't got time
for this.

07:00.594 --> 07:02.552
-Move! -Baby, I'm here now.
What you doing?

07:02.596 --> 07:04.249
-This ain't none of my fault.

07:04.293 --> 07:06.600
It's his fault!

07:06.643 --> 07:08.123
You always got
some type of excuse, man!

07:08.166 --> 07:09.516
No, this not
no excuse this time.

07:09.559 --> 07:11.474
Seriously, this is his fault.

07:11.518 --> 07:13.084
He called me, talking about
his car was broke down.

07:13.128 --> 07:14.912
You know what I'm talking about?
And I was on my way home to you.

07:14.956 --> 07:16.740
I had told him.
He said, could I help him.

07:16.784 --> 07:18.350
I was like, "Nah, I got to go
do the right thing."

07:18.394 --> 07:19.351
You know what I'm saying?

07:19.395 --> 07:20.614
But he start crying and stuff.

07:20.657 --> 07:22.137
Talking about his engine.

07:22.180 --> 07:23.530
Yeah, he had queef engine
or something like that.

07:23.573 --> 07:25.314
And his carburetor had jaundice.

07:25.357 --> 07:26.489
So I then had to go and pick him
up off the side of the road.

07:26.533 --> 07:28.317
'Cause only reason
why I did that

07:28.360 --> 07:29.710
is 'cause of all that Jesus
stuff you've been teaching me.

07:29.753 --> 07:31.712
You're supposed to help.
-Mm-hmm.

07:33.714 --> 07:36.760
He a magician!
How I supposed to know?

07:36.804 --> 07:38.719
Listen, baby, look.
Look, now.

07:38.762 --> 07:40.111
I'm trying to do
the right thing.

07:40.155 --> 07:41.765
I only did this 'cause of you.

07:41.809 --> 07:42.984
You've been trying
to get my life right.

07:43.027 --> 07:44.507
It's been 'cause of you
I'm doing this.

07:44.551 --> 07:46.596
I wouldn't even help the nigga
had it not been for you.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.206
That's why I even came
over here to tell you.

07:48.250 --> 07:49.556
I wanted to thank you
for all the stuff...

07:49.599 --> 07:52.428
You-You done changed my life.
Thank you, baby.

07:54.822 --> 07:57.607
-Hurry up.
-Thank you.

07:57.651 --> 08:00.001
Come on, baby. Here.

08:08.618 --> 08:10.794
My man, come on, let's get it.
Let's go.

08:10.838 --> 08:13.231
I ain't got all day.

08:15.233 --> 08:18.933
Oh... hey.
I wasn't talking to you.

08:18.976 --> 08:21.370
I was talking to my man.
Come on, bro.

08:21.413 --> 08:22.937
Bibby, man, I know you
kidding me with this shit.

08:22.980 --> 08:24.460
I know you ain't just
gonna cut his hair

08:24.504 --> 08:26.157
after driving me around
damn creation, man!

08:26.201 --> 08:27.550
Listen, I know, but he had
an appointment, though.

08:27.594 --> 08:29.204
-Nigga, so did I!
-That's true.

08:29.247 --> 08:31.249
But, technically,
his was before yours.

08:31.293 --> 08:33.730
Know what I'm sayin'?
Just calm down, man.

08:33.774 --> 08:35.558
We gonna be here five minutes.
He... he just need a line.

08:35.602 --> 08:37.212
-Go on, Bibby, man! Shit!
-Thank you, man.

08:37.255 --> 08:38.953
Come on now.
It's all good.

08:38.996 --> 08:41.999
Five more minutes.

08:42.043 --> 08:44.045
â™ª

09:01.105 --> 09:02.803
All right, little man.
There you go.

09:02.846 --> 09:04.631
-MARY: Bibby!

09:04.674 --> 09:05.806
The water's not running.

09:05.849 --> 09:07.634
I thought you said
you paid the bill.

09:07.677 --> 09:08.809
I did pay the bill!

09:08.852 --> 09:10.767
Well, I guess
I'm imagining things, huh?

09:10.811 --> 09:12.813
Thought I paid that bill.

09:17.774 --> 09:20.255
You're a magician?

09:20.298 --> 09:21.996
No.

09:22.039 --> 09:23.693
That's what Bibby said.

09:23.737 --> 09:26.304
-Well, Bibby's an idiot.
-That's mean.

09:28.089 --> 09:29.612
Can you show me a trick?

09:29.656 --> 09:34.225
Little man. I just told you
I wasn't a magician, okay?

09:34.269 --> 09:37.489
What's wrong with your hair?

09:37.533 --> 09:40.623
Are you sick or something?

09:44.714 --> 09:46.281
MARY:
And now the power?!

09:46.324 --> 09:49.240
-Bibby, you said you paid that!
-I did pay it, baby.

09:49.284 --> 09:51.242
You know Donald Trump
and them biz out here.

09:51.286 --> 09:53.636
The devil always trying
to steal our j...

09:53.680 --> 09:56.900
You did not just steal from me.

09:56.944 --> 09:58.510
This for the boy haircut!

09:58.554 --> 10:00.556
I got to go, baby.
God bless you now.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.776
-Bibby.

10:02.819 --> 10:04.516
Bibby!

10:05.561 --> 10:08.259
This nigga! Shit!

10:13.569 --> 10:15.832
Hey, man.
Sorry about all that.

10:15.876 --> 10:19.314
You know how crazy
these hos can get.

10:19.357 --> 10:22.012
Hey, guess I'm staying with my
other woman tonight, you know...

10:22.056 --> 10:23.927
Bibby, man, just take me back
to the shop, all right?

10:23.971 --> 10:25.363
I ain't playing with you, Bibby.

10:25.407 --> 10:27.844
Okay, all right.
All right.

10:27.888 --> 10:29.759
You must be starving
though, right?

10:29.803 --> 10:30.673
Hell yeah, man.

10:30.717 --> 10:32.719
My whole day been fucked up
so far. Yes.

10:32.762 --> 10:35.896
Good. Let me get you something
to eat. It's the least I can do.

10:35.939 --> 10:37.332
-I'm-a take care of you.

10:37.375 --> 10:38.812
Take you right back
to the shop after that.

10:38.855 --> 10:41.249
We're gonna eat.
Hey, you like Zaxby's?

10:41.292 --> 10:44.818
Nigga, don't be rude.

10:44.861 --> 10:47.255
-Of course I love Zaxby's.
-I got you.

10:47.298 --> 10:49.692
Thank you.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.651
Talking 'bout. Shit.

10:56.307 --> 10:58.266
What...?

10:58.309 --> 11:00.964
-Yeah.

11:01.008 --> 11:02.400
Come on, man, you know
I dabble in construction

11:02.444 --> 11:04.098
from time to time.
Come on, you got to eat!

11:04.141 --> 11:05.577
Nigga, this ain't no restaurant!

11:05.621 --> 11:07.928
You coming or not?
Come on!

11:07.971 --> 11:10.408
Here we go.

11:10.452 --> 11:11.801
Zaxby's!

11:14.456 --> 11:16.414
Nigga, these your leftovers?

11:16.458 --> 11:20.114
No! I mean, I did eat the
chicken wings. And the sauce.

11:20.157 --> 11:22.856
And part of that bread. But them
chicken tenders right there,

11:22.899 --> 11:24.205
that's all you, my man.

11:24.248 --> 11:26.990
Take me back to the shop, now,
'cause I swear,

11:27.034 --> 11:28.992
you keep playing with me, Bibby,

11:29.036 --> 11:30.167
and I'm-a fuck you up,
all right?

11:30.211 --> 11:32.430
Listen. You the one
said you was hungry.

11:32.474 --> 11:34.084
I was just trying
to help you out,

11:34.128 --> 11:35.999
but we can go back to the shop.

11:36.043 --> 11:37.131
Thank you. Let's go, man.

11:37.174 --> 11:38.872
Hey, yo, just help me
get this lumber

11:38.915 --> 11:40.830
-in the back of my truck...
-Man, fuck that, man!

11:40.874 --> 11:42.571
Finish my hair!

11:42.614 --> 11:44.007
Man, help me get this lumber.
I promise,

11:44.051 --> 11:45.748
the faster we do this,
the faster I can cut your hair.

11:45.792 --> 11:48.446
I'm taking you right back to
the shop after this, I promise.

11:48.490 --> 11:51.362
Just help me load this up.
I promise!

11:51.406 --> 11:54.191
Fuck, man!

11:54.235 --> 11:56.193
Nigga, three?
You better pick up five.

11:56.237 --> 11:58.674
-Use your back, too, bitch.
-I don't have that many muscles.

11:58.718 --> 11:59.719
Come on, man.

12:02.286 --> 12:05.899
Perfect. Just got
one more bundle, my man.

12:05.942 --> 12:07.944
Shit!

12:09.511 --> 12:11.818
Hey, yo, Al, let's go, man.

12:11.861 --> 12:15.386
What do you think you're doing?
You stealing my lumber?

12:15.430 --> 12:17.258
-What the... What are you, uh...
-Hey, ma'am, calm...

12:17.301 --> 12:19.390
What the hell do you think
you're doing on my property?

12:19.434 --> 12:21.001
-Ma'am, calm down.
-You're trespassing.

12:21.044 --> 12:22.350
I know, ma'am.
Just calm down. Listen.

12:22.393 --> 12:24.047
No, I will not calm down.
Who the hell are you?

12:24.091 --> 12:25.135
Listen, I work
for the contractors

12:25.179 --> 12:26.397
that's building
the house, right?

12:26.441 --> 12:28.835
I loaned ya'll this lumber
as collateral.

12:28.878 --> 12:30.837
-And then ain't nobody paid
us... -I'm calling the cops.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.186
-Bibby.
-Don't call the... Listen.

12:32.229 --> 12:33.622
All that ain't necessary, ma'am.

12:33.665 --> 12:34.841
I had to reconfiscate this wood

12:34.884 --> 12:36.668
'cause ain't nobody
paid me my money.

12:36.712 --> 12:37.931
So, you should speak
to your husband,

12:37.974 --> 12:39.193
-so we can get paid.

12:39.236 --> 12:41.195
Oh, I will call my husband,
and then the police.

12:41.238 --> 12:43.980
Well, do it then, beige lady!
Call 'em!

12:44.024 --> 12:46.287
Hey! You son of a bitch.

12:46.330 --> 12:48.028
We're gonna sue you!

12:48.071 --> 12:50.639
Sue! But you need to talk
to your husband,

12:50.682 --> 12:53.511
'cause we ain't had
no contracts, 'cause he cheap.

12:55.252 --> 12:57.298
â™ª

12:58.908 --> 13:00.823
That's my wood!

13:08.135 --> 13:11.312
Hey. You don't think
she called the police, do you?

13:11.355 --> 13:16.099
I'm still on probation, nigga,
so I hope the fuck not.

13:16.143 --> 13:18.972
Nah, she ain't call 'em.
We all right. It's all good.

13:19.015 --> 13:20.843
Do I even have to say it, Bibby?

13:23.150 --> 13:24.760
-We should probably... -Should
probably head back to the shop.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.457
-Just head on back to the shop,
yeah.  That's right.

13:26.501 --> 13:29.417
I'm-a take you right on back,
get you cut up real quick.

13:29.460 --> 13:32.028
I got you, Paper Boi.

13:41.124 --> 13:43.126
-Oh, hell no!

13:45.172 --> 13:46.869
â™ª

13:54.790 --> 13:57.575
Bibby, goddamn it, man!
What are you doing?!

13:57.619 --> 14:00.796
-It's all good. It's all good.
-Fucking toothpicks, man. Shit!

14:07.063 --> 14:08.935
How you gonna do that when
I got no seat belt on, nigga?

14:08.978 --> 14:10.284
My bad. You should wear
your seat belt at all times.

14:10.327 --> 14:12.025
Yeah, no shit.
Why is your shit...?

14:12.068 --> 14:13.722
-Yeah, that's the only thing.
-Man, Bibby...

14:13.765 --> 14:15.115
Fuck it.

14:15.158 --> 14:16.638
Oh, yeah, that one
don't work good.

14:23.601 --> 14:25.603
Shit.

14:25.647 --> 14:28.563
Lamar!

14:28.606 --> 14:29.912
Look, Pops...

14:29.956 --> 14:31.783
Hey, tell me
they just kidnapped you.

14:31.827 --> 14:34.003
I know good and goddamn well
you ain't out here

14:34.047 --> 14:35.135
skipping school again.

14:35.178 --> 14:36.484
Tell me you're not skipping
school again.

14:36.527 --> 14:37.789
-I'm sorry, Pops!
-Nah, don't be sorry.

14:37.833 --> 14:39.269
-Shit.
-Don't be sorry now.

14:39.313 --> 14:40.923
You think I work hard
at these three jobs

14:40.967 --> 14:44.187
so you can walk around town with
your little nigglet friends,

14:44.231 --> 14:46.189
skipping school all day?

14:46.233 --> 14:48.104
I work hard, man.

14:48.148 --> 14:51.194
But y'all think y'all grown,
don't you

14:51.238 --> 14:53.631
Well, since y'all grown,
please tell me you put up

14:53.675 --> 14:55.633
the street team posters
I gave you today.

14:55.677 --> 14:57.200
Man, we put up a couple.

14:57.244 --> 14:58.593
-We put up a couple!

14:58.636 --> 15:00.377
-We put up a couple!

15:00.421 --> 15:02.902
Give them to me.
Give them to me.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.080
Man, y'all barely made a dent!

15:07.123 --> 15:09.082
You had one thing to do today.

15:09.125 --> 15:11.171
We ain't gonna never
get this $35 now.

15:11.214 --> 15:14.000
And I trusted you
to do this for me.

15:14.043 --> 15:15.958
You little niggas
ain't shit, man.

15:16.002 --> 15:17.568
That's all right, though.

15:17.612 --> 15:19.788
'Cause I got somebody here
for you, matter of fact.

15:19.831 --> 15:20.963
Hey, yo, Alfred!

15:23.009 --> 15:25.011
The hell you want, Bibby?

15:25.054 --> 15:26.969
Hey! Come inspire the youth!

15:27.013 --> 15:29.232
-Man, I ain't in this!
-Alfred, this is my son.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.019
Yo, is that

15:33.062 --> 15:34.803
Yeah, that's right.
That is Paper Boi.

15:34.846 --> 15:36.022
And I brought him up here
to inspire y'all,

15:36.065 --> 15:37.240
since y'all don't listen to me.

15:37.284 --> 15:39.155
Hey, yo!
How come you don't look fresh?

15:39.199 --> 15:42.245
-You don't look fresh or famous.

15:42.289 --> 15:45.031
Y-Your hair is raggedy as shit.
Damn!

15:45.074 --> 15:46.902
You out here looking
like a Super Saiyan.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.164
Your hair is fucked up, man.

15:48.208 --> 15:50.253
Like, damn. Oh, shit.

15:50.297 --> 15:52.386
What the fuck did you do
to his hair, yo?

15:52.429 --> 15:54.475
-Lamar. Not right now.
Not right now. -Pops. Pops.

15:54.518 --> 15:56.129
Not right now.

15:59.132 --> 16:01.090
You know why
it's fucked up? Hey.

16:01.134 --> 16:02.613
You know why it's fucked up?

16:02.657 --> 16:04.093
'Cause your crazy-ass daddy
was supposed

16:04.137 --> 16:05.834

16:05.877 --> 16:08.228
And what the hell
it matter anyway, nigga?

16:08.271 --> 16:09.707
I'm a regular-ass person.

16:09.751 --> 16:11.231
I need to get
my hair cut sometimes.

16:11.274 --> 16:12.841
Famous people need to eat
and shit

16:12.884 --> 16:15.713
and brush their goddamn teeth!

16:15.757 --> 16:17.889
I'm regular, bruh, all right?

16:19.500 --> 16:22.068
Yo, so, um... can you put me on?

16:22.111 --> 16:24.157
What?

16:24.200 --> 16:25.636
I got a fire mixtape.

16:25.680 --> 16:26.986
I'm like Lonzo Ball.

16:28.770 --> 16:30.598
It's actually pretty good.

16:30.641 --> 16:33.209
I'm done, man. Yup.

16:33.253 --> 16:35.733
I'm done, bruh. That's it.

16:35.777 --> 16:37.170
We done!

16:37.213 --> 16:39.041
We done.
I'm going back to the shop,

16:39.085 --> 16:41.087
cut his hair 'cause that's
what grown people do...

16:41.130 --> 16:43.176
Yo, Lamar! Man, get your ass
in the car.

16:43.219 --> 16:45.308
-Come over here.
-Bibby, let's go, man!

16:45.352 --> 16:47.702
We... Come on, let's go.

16:47.745 --> 16:49.486
Take y'all asses to school!

16:54.796 --> 16:57.320
-Pops, I said I was sorry.
Hey! My man,

16:57.364 --> 16:59.409
you don't have to be
sorry to me at all.

16:59.453 --> 17:00.976
You can save that.
I don't care at all.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.543
Hey, you got to explain that
to your mama.

17:02.586 --> 17:05.067
-Please do not tell Mama. God!
Don't tell your mama?

17:05.111 --> 17:06.677
Well, I'm calling her right now.

17:06.721 --> 17:08.549
She got to know.
Shit, she the one wanted you.

17:08.592 --> 17:10.290
-Bibby...

17:10.333 --> 17:12.205
-I know. The kids these days,
right? -The road, man...

17:12.248 --> 17:14.555
-The road, Bibby.

17:14.598 --> 17:16.122
-Now you got Paper Boi mad.
-Bibby, the road, man.

17:16.165 --> 17:17.210
-Yeah. I got this!

17:17.253 --> 17:18.776
Nigga, if you kill me,
I swear to God,

17:18.820 --> 17:20.909
-I'm-a fuck you up, boy.
-It's all good. I got this.

17:20.952 --> 17:22.215
Oh, that's it.
Him asking me for favors,

17:22.258 --> 17:23.129
you know what I'm talking about?

17:23.172 --> 17:25.218
-These kids these days.

17:25.261 --> 17:26.567
I ask you for favors
all the time.

17:26.610 --> 17:28.003
You don't know nothing
about nothing!

17:28.047 --> 17:29.265
Huh. Shit.

17:29.309 --> 17:30.919
"Son, can you take
the trash out?"

17:30.962 --> 17:32.312
-Bibby.

17:32.355 --> 17:34.227
-The road, bruh.
-I-I'm fine.

17:34.270 --> 17:37.447
-Damn. "Son, could you please
stop skipping school?" -Bibby.

17:37.491 --> 17:39.362
-"Son, could you not jack off
with my good lotion?" -Bibby.

17:39.406 --> 17:41.147
Right in front
of Paper Boi? -That kind.

17:41.190 --> 17:42.148
-Simple. Simple...
-Bibby. Bibby!

17:44.063 --> 17:46.804
-Bibby, man... Fuck!

17:46.848 --> 17:48.154
-Nigga, man... -I'm fine.

17:48.197 --> 17:49.938
Man, I got weed
in my fucking pockets, Bibby!

17:49.981 --> 17:51.157
It's okay. Okay.
Everybody good.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.115
-Everybody good.
-Get the fuck off me, man.

17:53.159 --> 17:54.986
All right. It's good.
Everything good. Hey, listen.

17:55.030 --> 17:56.379
Hey, y'all,
this what we gonna do.

17:56.423 --> 17:57.989
Hey, hop in the driver's seat
right quick.

girlfriend immediately in jail.

19:27.253 --> 19:28.819
Hello?

19:28.863 --> 19:30.473
Smooth, what's good, baby?

19:30.517 --> 19:32.606
Oh, no, baby. I ain't busy.

You should've been called me.
I got that on me right now.

No, I'll bring it to you

19:38.089 --> 19:40.570
I'm on my way.
I'll be right over there.

19:40.614 --> 19:43.356
Yeah, I'm on my way.
No big deal.

19:43.399 --> 19:46.315
Hey. I left something
in my truck.

19:52.756 --> 19:55.324
Let's get you that haircut.

20:07.989 --> 20:09.382
All righty.

20:09.425 --> 20:11.427
My man. There you go.

20:11.471 --> 20:14.387
See, no problem.
Looking good.

20:14.430 --> 20:16.215
Ready.

20:18.478 --> 20:21.394

20:21.437 --> 20:24.875
Hey, um, you forgot to pay me.

20:24.919 --> 20:27.356
ALFRED: Nigga, you got to be
fucking kidding me.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.315
Nah. You haven't paid me.

20:29.358 --> 20:31.882
You know,

20:31.926 --> 20:33.536

20:33.580 --> 20:35.321

with the fucking cops,

20:35.364 --> 20:38.933

with your goddamn driving, man.

20:38.976 --> 20:42.197
Ruined?
Nigga, we had a good day today.

20:42.241 --> 20:45.200
I took you to mentor
to some kids. You're welcome.

20:45.244 --> 20:46.767
And then we-we ate
at that white lady house.

20:46.810 --> 20:48.986
