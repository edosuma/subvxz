00:55.520 --> 01:02.085
Once upon a time,
long ago in Fantabularasa

01:02.100 --> 01:06.037
- there was a baby
- who was a Princess.

01:06.175 --> 01:09.873
But then this mean old
witch showed up at her christening

01:10.050 --> 01:12.986
and put a curse on the Princess.

01:13.156 --> 01:18.652
If she gets pricked by something
before she turns eighteen

01:18.766 --> 01:22.294
she and everyone in the castle
will fall asleep just like that.

01:22.507 --> 01:24.703
Nighty night! For a hundred years!

01:24.845 --> 01:27.679
Unless someone comes along

01:27.884 --> 01:29.352
or someone without a horse

01:29.488 --> 01:33.550
who loves the Princess a whole bunch
and gives her a kiss.

01:33.763 --> 01:35.391
- But her dad
- the king

01:35.633 --> 01:37.534
is still really scared

01:37.737 --> 01:40.400
the witch might come back
and prick his little girl.

01:40.610 --> 01:45.207
That's why he made her
wear this suit of armor.

01:45.453 --> 01:47.251
That must have been really uncomfortable.

01:47.390 --> 01:49.484
And she had to wear it all the time,

01:49.595 --> 01:51.621
even when she was almost
a grown up already...

01:51.832 --> 01:55.064
- in the castle...
- of Fantabularasa.

02:54.625 --> 02:57.026
So you've lost the key
to your chastity belt again?

02:57.197 --> 02:58.529
Fear not. We've all been there.

02:58.699 --> 03:02.158
Mosey on down to Jebediah Runkelsteen's,
the fastest blacksmith in town.

03:02.407 --> 03:04.876
And if bed bugs are keeping you up at night.
Burn your mattress.

03:05.113 --> 03:05.773
Duh!

03:05.947 --> 03:09.179
And now for the weather
forecast our very own druid. Steve...

03:20.510 --> 03:21.808
Princess?

03:22.380 --> 03:24.349
- Rose?
- Jack!

03:27.190 --> 03:28.681
You're in danger!

03:28.893 --> 03:31.192
Dellamorta! She knows about our love!

03:31.332 --> 03:33.733
- Dellamorta?
- She knows about you!

03:34.438 --> 03:35.701
Is she here?

03:36.975 --> 03:39.501
She has ears everywhere.

03:40.416 --> 03:43.147
And you are the only one
who could lift her curse!

03:43.255 --> 03:46.248
- You have to hide!
- Hide? Where?

03:47.130 --> 03:48.655
Somewhere safe.

03:49.267 --> 03:51.668
Somewhere she won't find me.

03:52.307 --> 03:53.900
Let's tarot it!

03:57.217 --> 03:59.743
Here! In the deep Underwood...

03:59.921 --> 04:02.982
- beyond the seven... uh...
- Beyond the seven hills?

04:03.162 --> 04:06.291
Yes. Beyond the hills
in the green wood shade...

04:07.337 --> 04:10.330
where the 7 dwarfs
their dwelling have made...

04:11.111 --> 04:13.248
I thought that's just a fairy tale.

04:13.249 --> 04:14.683
You'll be safe there.

04:15.052 --> 04:18.648
Stay there until
the celebration here at court is over.

04:18.892 --> 04:21.226
And in case Dellamorta's curse should...

04:21.732 --> 04:25.032
come true, then you, my hero,

04:25.139 --> 04:28.473
will come back and save me
and the whole castle

04:28.612 --> 04:30.604
with the kiss of true love.

04:30.783 --> 04:34.550
Yes, that's true. I love you, Rose.

04:34.791 --> 04:37.192
Here! For you!

04:37.664 --> 04:43.695
Wear it close to your heart!
This way, I'll always be near you.

04:48.319 --> 04:50.311
Are you alone, Rose?

04:50.490 --> 04:53.358
Er... yes, of course I am, Daddy!

04:53.496 --> 04:55.727
Well, who are you talking to then?

04:55.933 --> 04:58.129
Nobody. I'm just...
e... practicing my speech

04:58.539 --> 04:59.802
for my birthday...

05:00.042 --> 05:02.910
Right. Very good, my child.

05:48.906 --> 05:52.343
Guys! We need to get back to basics.

05:52.480 --> 05:54.847
It's fairy cake time

08:02.340 --> 08:03.831
Where's Bobo?

08:32.900 --> 08:34.493
- Hey!
- Oups!

08:35.873 --> 08:38.001
Hello, I'm kind of lost.

08:39.514 --> 08:42.541
I'm Jack, little man, and who are you?

08:43.188 --> 08:46.488
Hello Jack little-man. I'm Bobo.

08:46.594 --> 08:49.533
Be careful, Bobo,
your shoelaces are untied.

08:49.534 --> 08:52.368
Oh no, not again...

08:53.275 --> 08:56.211
No worries. I know how to tie my shoes.

08:56.381 --> 08:58.282
Wow! Good.

09:00.489 --> 09:03.459
We're baking a birthday cake
for Princess Rose

09:03.862 --> 09:06.593
and I'm supposed to pick
the apple to go on top...

09:06.701 --> 09:10.069
For Rose? For my Rose?

09:21.531 --> 09:23.523
Ah, oh, what a nice song.

09:23.668 --> 09:26.194
- Bobo!
- Just a minute Jack.

09:26.908 --> 09:28.774
Bobooo!

09:32.620 --> 09:36.682
Wow! Thanks, Ja! Eeh... Jack?...

09:39.200 --> 09:41.567
Jack Littleman?

10:05.886 --> 10:08.219
Bobo's still not here

10:08.325 --> 10:11.159
I'm sure he'll be here any moment now...

10:12.633 --> 10:15.000
- Bo...
- Yahhhh...

10:19.647 --> 10:21.707
Got it! Safe!

10:22.686 --> 10:24.552
Bobo, you klutz!

10:24.624 --> 10:27.617
The cake is ruined.
Do you know what that means?

10:28.832 --> 10:31.324
Cake fight!

10:57.723 --> 11:01.023
Very funny. I'm not...

11:04.770 --> 11:09.401
What are we going to give Princess Rose
for her birthday now?

11:10.048 --> 11:14.816
No problem. I always keep an emergency cake
in my feast aid kit.

11:16.160 --> 11:17.856
Seriously?

11:22.606 --> 11:24.097
One for all...

11:24.710 --> 11:26.906
and all at once.

11:39.106 --> 11:41.302
Put me down! Let me go!

11:47.356 --> 11:49.120
That's not funny!

11:50.796 --> 11:53.163
Delicious.

12:32.780 --> 12:34.544
What are you going to do with me?

12:34.817 --> 12:38.379
If you plan to eat me,
let me tell you I taste horrible.

12:38.525 --> 12:41.427
I know what I'm talking about.
I work in a kitchen.

12:42.766 --> 12:43.790
Let me go!

12:44.036 --> 12:47.200
Princess Rose has sent me on a mission,
which I must fulfill.

12:47.409 --> 12:51.369
She's the love of my life!
Surely you know the meaning of love?

12:52.553 --> 12:54.215
Burner!

12:59.500 --> 13:02.129
Dellamorta! YOU!

13:04.777 --> 13:07.747
Soon, I'll have my revenge, kitchen boy.

13:08.051 --> 13:10.816
How precious!

13:15.599 --> 13:17.227
Up you go!

13:18.805 --> 13:24.676
It's too bad that you won't be there
to see my wrath. Isn't it?

13:27.789 --> 13:31.055
You will not touch a single hair
on her head, witch!

13:31.999 --> 13:35.163
Temper, temper...

13:36.007 --> 13:39.341
You won't even get into the castle
what with all the guards and stuff.

13:39.780 --> 13:46.619
You may be right, but
what if I am inside it already...?

14:09.139 --> 14:13.201
Dear, hipi, hapa, houp,
hapless, finder.

14:13.414 --> 14:15.849
I lost this mirror in the woods.

14:16.320 --> 14:19.290
But I hadn't noticed yet that it was lost.

14:19.493 --> 14:22.588
Which means, I won't be cooking,
eh... looking for it.

14:22.733 --> 14:27.942
So if you want,
you can use it as a bluevtagroup.

14:27.943 --> 14:30.469
Birthday gift, for the princess.

14:30.615 --> 14:32.982
But we already have a present for Rose!

14:34.623 --> 14:36.285
Not anymore...

14:36.494 --> 14:37.393
Huh?

14:37.696 --> 14:40.598
Hmmm...
this could be a highly sophisticated trap!

14:43.007 --> 14:44.066
On the other hand

14:44.243 --> 14:47.839
How could we distrust something
with such an adorable ribbon?

14:48.017 --> 14:51.715
Well, there's that.
Okay, let's load the mirror up and forge ahead!

14:51.924 --> 14:53.517
Yeah

15:40.021 --> 15:41.785
What do you think,
does size really matter?

15:41.991 --> 15:42.287
Oh, yeah.

15:42.425 --> 15:44.917
Cinderella, what went through your mind
when you lost the shoe?

15:45.064 --> 15:47.431
- I guess my foot's gonna get cold.
- Over here, please!

15:47.536 --> 15:49.027
One minute! One minute!

15:49.173 --> 15:51.870
Smile, please! Oh fabulous,
I love your smile. I love it!

15:52.112 --> 15:54.274
Watch out, dwarf!

15:57.022 --> 16:00.356
Welcome to Red Riding Hood TV...

16:00.929 --> 16:04.366
Everyone who's anyone is here.
I see Puss in Boots...

16:04.503 --> 16:05.562
So, where are the pussies?

16:05.672 --> 16:07.937
- So I says to her, you wanna kiss me,
- Frog Prince...

16:08.077 --> 16:09.568
eat a mint. You never know,
one thing leads to another...

16:09.713 --> 16:12.308
Ali Baba and the 40 thieves...

16:14.056 --> 16:16.218
Everyone is gossiping about whether or not

16:16.460 --> 16:19.055
Princess Rose will succumb
to the witch's curse.

16:19.199 --> 16:21.964
Will she prick her finger
and fall into a 100 year sleep...

16:22.105 --> 16:24.870
along with the rest of the court?
What do you think, Wolfie?

16:25.011 --> 16:29.107
Well, first, I have to say,
You look delish.

16:29.253 --> 16:33.020
Oh oh, what's that?
Birthday Girl's BFF is just arriving.

16:36.700 --> 16:37.565
Huh...?

16:41.076 --> 16:43.307
Wow!

16:51.998 --> 16:55.127
- Snow White!
- Stop!

16:55.772 --> 16:58.037
No pointy objects!

16:58.044 --> 17:03.108
Oh, no! A dwarf never takes off his hat.
It's bad luck.

17:03.287 --> 17:04.949
They're with me.

17:05.692 --> 17:08.388
Don't worry, sweetheart.

17:09.465 --> 17:13.130
You know the way to the V.I.P. entrance?
Have a great night.

17:13.273 --> 17:15.140
Not a chance!

17:19.152 --> 17:22.680
Drop your gifts on the gift table, dwarfs.

17:23.294 --> 17:26.025
Excuse me... don't mind me...

17:29.840 --> 17:33.470
oh, oh wait! Watch out!
Please don't step on it!

17:33.714 --> 17:37.981
I designed this as an emergency escape
for Princess Rose.

17:38.691 --> 17:41.661
It has the latest in slide technology!

17:43.868 --> 17:45.962
Nothing can go wrong...

17:52.585 --> 17:54.281
- Daddy...?
- Oh my darling,

17:54.456 --> 17:57.153
you look radiant in that dress...

18:01.070 --> 18:03.198
You look, like, awesome, girl.

18:04.943 --> 18:08.038
Rose! May I introduce you to my friends?

18:10.054 --> 18:14.754
How nice. Oh hello children.

18:15.798 --> 18:19.667
Bella! These are the 7 dwarfs!

18:20.108 --> 18:22.111
The 7 dwarfs!

18:22.112 --> 18:24.547
Let me guess, you are...?

18:24.850 --> 18:27.115
- I love quizzes!
- Sunny.

18:27.455 --> 18:30.254
- Who else! Umpf.
- You are Cloudy.

18:31.630 --> 18:34.293
- You must be Ralphy.
- Are you okay?

18:34.503 --> 18:36.631
- No.
- Cooky. I Well...

18:38.444 --> 18:39.935
You certainly are Tshakko.

18:40.148 --> 18:42.879
- How do you know?
- Speedy, I am sure.

18:43.754 --> 18:44.722
But...

18:45.825 --> 18:47.384
who are you?

18:48.999 --> 18:50.524
I am Bobo.

18:50.668 --> 18:54.628
Oh, my God!
I'm so happy, you could make it!

18:54.809 --> 18:55.777
Well...

18:55.978 --> 18:57.344
And as for Jack...

18:57.815 --> 18:58.180
little man?

18:58.250 --> 18:59.650
If anyone should ask.

18:59.853 --> 19:03.813
You never heard of Jack,
and he never was at your house. Understood?

19:04.329 --> 19:06.025
- Who is Jack?
- Never heard of him.

19:06.233 --> 19:08.828
There was never a Jack at our house.

19:09.039 --> 19:15.036
Good. Perfect. Very convincing...
By the way, your shoelaces are untied.

19:21.930 --> 19:23.159
Got it!

19:26.073 --> 19:29.202
- I hope, they have ginger bread
- Not again

19:34.256 --> 19:39.752
Tempus reversus hora...

19:45.845 --> 19:51.113
Tempus reversus hora... Now!

19:53.227 --> 19:56.197
I smell... dwarf!

19:57.135 --> 20:00.401
I hate dwarfs!

20:19.779 --> 20:22.544
Snow White! Snow White! Snow White!

20:22.652 --> 20:25.087
Look into the mirror! Look into the mirror!

20:25.257 --> 20:27.089
I'd love to...

20:27.328 --> 20:31.424
Well, you little mirror, mirror on the wall...
Who is the fairest of them all?

20:31.703 --> 20:35.299
No, no, don't say... Of course! Snow White!

20:35.478 --> 20:38.505
- Dear people of Fantabularasa!
- Hats up! Dellamorta...

20:38.584 --> 20:42.043
- Dellamorta is here!
- Shhh, Bobo, be quiet,

20:42.291 --> 20:44.283
the king is talking to us.

20:45.364 --> 20:48.425
- Everything under control again.
- No.

20:49.139 --> 20:53.873
It gives me great pleasuer
to introduce my beloved daughter...

21:08.544 --> 21:11.605
You all know what that means to us?...

21:13.854 --> 21:19.851
18 long years are over now.
Fear and terror are over.

21:20.034 --> 21:25.405
As of this minute,
Dellamorta's curse is history...

21:32.525 --> 21:34.653
Ooohhhh...

22:12.071 --> 22:21.344
Happyyyyyyy Biiiiiirthdayyyy
toooooooo youuuuuuuuuu!

22:24.662 --> 22:33.696
It's time to turn history into my story.
Now, my curse shall fall upon you!

22:33.914 --> 22:35.280
Dellamorta.

22:35.818 --> 22:38.413
- Why?
- You're too late.

22:38.790 --> 22:41.487
It's after midnight, witch!

22:41.796 --> 22:44.664
That's what you think my dear.

22:44.902 --> 22:47.201
SHE CHANGED THE CLOCK!

22:48.477 --> 22:50.275
Seize the witch!

23:29.192 --> 23:31.354
Burner, Sit!

23:34.202 --> 23:39.607
Dear guests, don't be afraid!
Dellamorta cannot do us any harm.

23:39.846 --> 23:43.442
Whatever she may plan,
the curse will not afflict us for long,

23:43.754 --> 23:46.588
because Someone will come
and awaken me and us all.

23:46.860 --> 23:49.489
WITH THE KISS OF TRUE LOVE!

23:51.369 --> 23:56.501
You mean your brave little kitchen boy,
Jack? Don't you?

23:58.083 --> 24:02.282
But oh, but woe, where is he,
your hero, your savior?

24:02.491 --> 24:03.515
Did he get lost?

24:03.527 --> 24:06.554
On his way over the hills
in the green wood shade,

24:06.766 --> 24:10.396
where the 7 dwarfs
their dwelling have made?

24:11.910 --> 24:13.936
- Who is Jack?
- I don't know Jack.

24:14.115 --> 24:15.378
- What Jack?
- Jack is gone.

24:15.517 --> 24:17.509
- Ringeling, doesn't ring a bell.
- Not really...

24:17.688 --> 24:20.021
- I didn't see anyone.
- No, no, dwarfs!

24:20.160 --> 24:23.392
You can admit it now,
the charade is over... Right?

24:23.567 --> 24:25.058
Ww... What charade?

24:25.604 --> 24:26.469
Oh.

24:44.408 --> 24:46.240
What have you done with Jack?

24:46.346 --> 24:48.815
I know Jack. I met him in the forest.

24:49.118 --> 24:51.519
He picked up an apple for me... hihi...

24:53.693 --> 24:56.959
Burner! You greedy Monster!

24:57.201 --> 24:59.193
I have everything under control here!

24:59.338 --> 25:03.742
Fly back to the lair
and look after our prisoner!

25:08.189 --> 25:16.689
And as for you, my pretty...
Spiritus mesmoriso!

25:19.979 --> 25:23.609
Must prick finger.

25:24.055 --> 25:25.284
No!

25:25.958 --> 25:29.053
Must prick finger.

25:29.832 --> 25:33.291
Must prick finger.

25:34.275 --> 25:41.409
Must prick... hugh?

25:42.725 --> 25:44.785
Oh, this won't be good.

25:47.267 --> 25:49.202
Oh, I saw that coming.

26:18.129 --> 26:19.563
Check!

26:25.944 --> 26:28.778
What happened? Where am I?

26:40.874 --> 26:43.969
How was she supposed to prick me
in the finger with this?

26:44.281 --> 26:45.647
No idea.

26:46.052 --> 26:48.647
Maybe you just have to press here...

26:48.991 --> 26:50.152
Oopsi!

26:50.494 --> 26:51.985
Ouch!

27:01.883 --> 27:04.580
Miau! These boots were made for walking!

27:05.090 --> 27:06.649
Back in a minute.

27:08.663 --> 27:12.395
Dwarfs, it's time to leave this building,
a... a... a... as fast as we can.

27:12.704 --> 27:16.402
We've to get out of here!
Follow me, dwarfs!

27:16.679 --> 27:17.476
Why not?

27:17.648 --> 27:19.378
Speedy, let's follow Snow White!

27:21.756 --> 27:22.724
Why?

27:29.872 --> 27:31.670
Take another way!

27:32.711 --> 27:34.612
No way.

27:36.285 --> 27:38.254
Anyone got a ladder in their pocket.

27:59.965 --> 28:02.764
- An emergency slide!
- I loooove emergency slides!

28:02.904 --> 28:04.202
Why am I not surprised?

28:04.375 --> 28:05.843
Any idea as to the final destination?

28:05.944 --> 28:09.108
- Nope.
- 'Emerge' sounds good, doesn't it?

28:19.038 --> 28:20.802
Oh no...

29:07.300 --> 29:10.134
All right, everybody!
Dwarfs are tough, we don't bluff.

29:10.373 --> 29:11.864
We ain't meek and we protect the weak.

29:12.144 --> 29:12.839
We're going in!

29:13.079 --> 29:16.572
Never forget,
We're small, but that means nothing at all.

29:17.487 --> 29:19.718
That's not what she said.

29:39.798 --> 29:41.858
Oh, Rose!

30:13.132 --> 30:18.799
Sometimes,
a little bad luck is all you need.

30:26.225 --> 30:29.787
Revenge is best served cold...

30:32.037 --> 30:33.869
ice cold!

32:39.224 --> 32:41.750
Sorry, eh... I was just deep in thought.

32:41.929 --> 32:43.022
Which thought would that be?

32:43.032 --> 32:44.000
I don't know.

32:44.134 --> 32:45.261
Thought so.

32:45.436 --> 32:46.870
Rose!

32:58.028 --> 32:59.826
It's all my fault.

32:59.965 --> 33:02.696
No, it's not ALL your fault.

33:02.904 --> 33:05.305
What do you mean exactly?

33:05.509 --> 33:08.741
Well, maybe a little bit.
An teensy weensy bit.

33:08.916 --> 33:13.320
Who would have thought that such a thick thorn
would fit into such a tiny, round ring...

33:13.459 --> 33:16.224
Fault is really the wrong word.

33:16.598 --> 33:18.692
Why is everyone asleep?

33:18.836 --> 33:20.998
It could have happened to anyone.
Any one of us.

33:21.108 --> 33:22.167
It could have been much worse.

33:22.310 --> 33:24.074
Unlikely.

33:27.086 --> 33:28.452
Bobo?!

33:29.124 --> 33:31.093
Where are you going?

33:33.098 --> 33:37.468
I... uh... I have to fix this somehow.

33:38.542 --> 33:41.205
Bobo! You can't even tie your shoes!

33:41.448 --> 33:46.182
Are you nuts? That's ridiculous,
of course I can.

33:48.429 --> 33:51.024
I have to find Jack
and bring him back here.

33:51.201 --> 33:54.069
But what if you get hungry along the way?

33:54.574 --> 33:56.475
You don't even know the way

33:56.578 --> 34:00.310
Keep cool.
Good things come to those who wait.

34:00.486 --> 34:03.320
Who's going to remove the rocks in your path?

34:03.492 --> 34:06.621
And who's going to tickle you
if you're feeling blue?

34:06.765 --> 34:09.030
And who's going to prevent that?

34:19.090 --> 34:21.525
Where am I? Who am I?

34:21.828 --> 34:25.889
What am I doing here?
And what about Rose?

34:26.705 --> 34:31.040
Rose! Oh! I failed!

34:31.214 --> 34:34.116
Don't be too hard on yourself.
The slide was great!

34:34.219 --> 34:37.088
- Yes! Let's...
- Forget it.

34:37.527 --> 34:41.623
All right, time to get a move on
to save the scullion.

34:41.835 --> 34:47.672
Into the lion's den I go,
or the dragon's den maybe, whatever! Oh...

34:48.014 --> 34:53.351
Now the curse got me after all,
even though I hid in the grandfather's clock.

34:53.659 --> 34:56.025
Shouldn't have drilled those air holes in it.

34:56.965 --> 34:59.298
I'm getting too old for this.

35:07.186 --> 35:11.055
Confound it! I must save the scullion
from Dellamorta's clutches.

35:11.194 --> 35:13.026
Don't worry. We'll take care of that.

35:13.265 --> 35:16.030
You? Oh! You have no chance.

35:16.204 --> 35:17.172
Why not?

35:17.440 --> 35:21.104
Dellamorta is powerful.

35:21.281 --> 35:24.080
And we are the 7 dwarfs.

35:24.154 --> 35:26.146
My point exactly.

35:27.226 --> 35:31.163
You have to go across deep canyons,
dry deserts,

35:31.334 --> 35:40.835
raging waters, over icy mountain ridges
to a place where no dwarf has gone before.

35:41.454 --> 35:43.685
- No! Don't fall asleep!
- Stay awake!

35:43.792 --> 35:45.920
- Hey!
- Please, you have to help us.

35:46.097 --> 35:47.998
If we can be helped.

35:48.101 --> 35:51.469
I feel, I won't make it.
Give me my bag...

35:55.282 --> 35:57.683
I have three potions..

35:58.155 --> 36:03.150
This... this one here
will make you undefeatable.

36:04.867 --> 36:08.133
And eh... And this one
will make you invisible.

36:08.842 --> 36:15.578
And this?... What was this again?
Oh, right, that's just floor polish.

36:15.656 --> 36:17.386
Dwarf huddle!

36:21.301 --> 36:23.429
- We'll take the floor polish.
- Is it lemon?

36:23.572 --> 36:26.098
What? For Merlin's sake, think again...

36:26.244 --> 36:29.681
Remember This will make you
UN DE FEATABLE!

36:35.195 --> 36:39.656
Okay, now we understand.
So, we choose the floor polish.

36:43.211 --> 36:48.115
Good luck with all that.
Rose's fate is now in your hands.

36:52.496 --> 36:53.520
Wait, wait, wait!

36:53.932 --> 36:54.763
What now, Bobo?

36:55.035 --> 36:58.199
Does anyone know the way
to Dellamorta's hidden castle?

37:01.448 --> 37:02.780
Hello...

37:03.151 --> 37:04.244
Yes

37:08.795 --> 37:10.661
Did anyone understand that?

37:11.267 --> 37:13.065
No. You?

37:13.138 --> 37:15.198
- He drives...
- He said...

37:15.309 --> 37:16.436
Yes

37:23.959 --> 37:27.088
- Follow...
- Yes? What?

37:27.199 --> 37:30.795
The little signpost!

37:32.009 --> 37:33.568
Now... good luck.

37:36.684 --> 37:38.152
Snacks.

37:38.388 --> 37:39.378
Lookin' good!

37:45.502 --> 37:46.868
Yep!

37:46.938 --> 37:48.167
Hey, look!

37:49.143 --> 37:51.135
The little signpost!

37:51.214 --> 37:52.978
That way, really?

37:58.795 --> 38:00.957
Like the old man said 'Let's follow it!

38:01.067 --> 38:02.330
Yeah!

38:10.853 --> 38:12.822
Should I leave it
open for when we come back?

38:13.091 --> 38:16.118
Coming back is not really
the problem at this juncture.

38:22.409 --> 38:26.369
There's only one thing to be done
Blindly onward!

39:21.160 --> 39:22.355
We made it!

39:22.529 --> 39:24.293
Oh... Is that...?

39:24.433 --> 39:25.901
Dellamortas Island.

39:26.037 --> 39:28.029
So all we need now is a boat

39:28.174 --> 39:29.870
There must be some around
here somewhere.

39:30.045 --> 39:31.411
Does anyone have sunscreen?

39:31.581 --> 39:33.209
Get a grip, Sunny!

39:33.318 --> 39:36.811
- Do you want me to get sunburn?
- If need be, yes.

39:36.958 --> 39:40.895
Don't argue, guys.
We're this close to getting there.

39:41.367 --> 39:45.134
- Sunny! Stop whining!
- I'm not whining.

39:45.308 --> 39:47.106
Oh, that's not whining?

39:49.350 --> 39:50.784
Those are sirens.

39:50.919 --> 39:53.650
What? Where? Fire? Is there a fire?

39:53.825 --> 39:55.726
Actually, it sounds like mermaids.

39:55.829 --> 39:58.162
Unusual, for this time of year.

40:01.741 --> 40:03.607
Mermaids!

40:13.732 --> 40:18.466
Man, Jellyfish! I thought you brought
this to Orca to get fixed.

40:20.946 --> 40:22.710
Dude, salmon swim upstream, you know?

40:22.816 --> 40:25.454
He caught himself a new one.
Pretty fishy, man.

40:25.455 --> 40:27.287
Not a carp, dude?

40:27.459 --> 40:30.691
She's a carp, all right, jellyfish.
Did you check her scales?

40:31.000 --> 40:35.335
Forget it! Might as well go for a halibut,
know what I mean?

40:37.980 --> 40:39.846
Give me some fin, man!

40:41.554 --> 40:42.749
Uhm, excuse us?

40:42.890 --> 40:46.383
Might you possibly be able
to assist us in some small way?

40:46.731 --> 40:48.791
Hey, what kind of lobster is this dude?

40:48.935 --> 40:52.428
Don't bother the lobster, dude.
You know what I mean?

40:52.609 --> 40:54.544
Maybe Orca sent this guy.

40:55.382 --> 40:57.518
Ey jo, you here for the tang?

40:57.519 --> 41:01.718
Enough with the sweet water.
I said we don't have the dough.

41:02.095 --> 41:04.121
Are you mermaids?

41:04.333 --> 41:06.666
Jellyfish, man, what's up with that cod?

41:06.804 --> 41:08.363
What's all this fuss, Gus.

41:08.474 --> 41:11.706
Do we look like girls?
We're Sherman and Herman.

41:11.914 --> 41:13.405
- The merman!
- The merman!

41:13.651 --> 41:15.415
Haven't you heard of our new single?

41:15.555 --> 41:18.423
Seaweed Clan: a.k.a Return of Fishy Smalls.

41:18.661 --> 41:21.130
A.k.a Merman's Paradise?

41:22.202 --> 41:24.967
No... uhm..Nope!

41:25.475 --> 41:26.499
Seriously?

41:26.811 --> 41:29.178
Well it'll be bustin' up
the charts soon enough.

41:29.416 --> 41:32.443
O.k., so, what you crawfish needin'?

41:32.623 --> 41:34.558
We have to get to that island.

41:40.505 --> 41:43.202
Bad waters.
Wouldn't touch it with my tail fin.

41:43.344 --> 41:47.111
Death lurks in every corner!
It's dark, cold and scary!

41:47.452 --> 41:49.580
And don't forget the dragon.

41:49.991 --> 41:52.256
Oh man, he'll barbecue you!

41:52.496 --> 41:55.056
And you crawfish really want to go there?

41:56.804 --> 41:59.433
We have to save somebody
who needs our help. Jack!

41:59.510 --> 42:02.446
You little shrimps?
Fat chance, dude.

42:02.582 --> 42:04.744
Hey, don't go all emo on them, man.

42:04.920 --> 42:06.320
Like yo Momma said,

42:06.424 --> 42:10.259
"You only got no chance,
if you don't give yourself none."

42:10.432 --> 42:13.163
Ok, maybe we don't have a chance

42:13.271 --> 42:16.173
but we're going to use it! Come on men!

42:16.410 --> 42:19.539
Eh, eh, eh... Dwarf shrimps! Hang on a sec!

42:25.729 --> 42:29.097
Hey, Shrimps!
Wanna go for a joyride?

42:29.670 --> 42:31.400
YOU have a boat?

42:31.540 --> 42:33.441
Yeah, we used it for our video.

43:03.071 --> 43:05.939
How boring...

43:06.310 --> 43:10.873
Boring fatso house cats in
outdated boots!

43:10.986 --> 43:15.822
Totally boring slime ball amphibians!

43:16.097 --> 43:18.931
Deadly boring princes and princesses!

43:19.036 --> 43:24.634
Even boringer dwarfs! Boring old ma...!

43:29.089 --> 43:32.526
I don't smell any dwarfs.

43:37.939 --> 43:40.704
They are gone!

43:52.636 --> 43:56.073
I hate dwarfs

44:04.960 --> 44:10.194
What are they planning,
those tiny little creatures?

44:10.538 --> 44:12.131
Burner!

44:18.588 --> 44:20.056
What's this hole for?

44:20.325 --> 44:22.419
How else is the water supposed to get in?

44:22.662 --> 44:24.290
- Is that a good thing?
- As good as a tsunami.

44:24.466 --> 44:28.301
Ralphy, quick, make another hole
so that the water can get out again.

44:28.474 --> 44:29.703
No problem.

44:59.202 --> 45:01.171
What's so funny now?

45:05.415 --> 45:06.280
Check.

45:12.829 --> 45:14.058
Gotcha!

45:19.309 --> 45:20.800
Oh, no!

45:27.158 --> 45:28.888
It's alive!

45:29.096 --> 45:30.689
Sure!

45:30.965 --> 45:32.297
See Ya!

45:32.402 --> 45:33.563
Good bye!

45:34.005 --> 45:40.639
80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86,
87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93...

45:41.687 --> 45:48.719
712, 713, 714, 715, 716,

45:48.868 --> 45:52.805
twenty eight thousand two hundred four...

45:53.177 --> 45:58.514
twenty eight thousand two hundred six, no, five...

45:58.687 --> 46:01.816
Shoot, I lost track!
Now I will have to start all over again.

46:01.960 --> 46:03.724
No! Bobo! No!

46:14.219 --> 46:17.383
That's pretty deep.
How are we going to get down there.

46:17.659 --> 46:19.423
Dwarf sled!

46:20.731 --> 46:21.960
Ready!

46:23.771 --> 46:24.704
Set.

46:26.310 --> 46:27.505
Go!

46:27.979 --> 46:29.880
Yoohoo!

46:46.817 --> 46:49.309
No, we're not doing that again.

46:50.358 --> 46:51.917
Guys! Follow me!

47:07.058 --> 47:08.651
The dragon!

47:09.796 --> 47:12.766
Keep cool.
This dragon doesn't bite!

47:18.314 --> 47:19.839
Phew.

48:23.777 --> 48:26.611
Hello? Guys?!

48:45.254 --> 48:47.553
Hello, are you there?

48:47.792 --> 48:51.729
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

49:10.471 --> 49:16.900
Buuurner! Buuurner!

49:39.329 --> 49:44.700
The dwarfs have escaped,
gone, run away!

49:44.939 --> 49:49.343
I have no idea
where those little pointy hats could be,

49:49.616 --> 49:52.313
but I won't take any risks.

49:52.555 --> 49:56.959
I cannot allow them
to free that kitchen boy.

49:57.031 --> 49:59.262
So finish him!

50:00.938 --> 50:04.773
I want you to flamb? E him, the creature.

50:04.946 --> 50:10.681
Grill him! Barbecue him! And hurry up!

50:30.397 --> 50:32.161
We're too late!

50:36.743 --> 50:39.042
What did she do with Jack?

50:40.551 --> 50:41.883
Sorry...

50:43.423 --> 50:45.119
Let's ask him!

50:47.598 --> 50:49.123
Do you have any idea
what happened to Jack?

50:49.335 --> 50:50.394
I'm Jack.

50:51.072 --> 50:53.007
Uh huh! Says who?
Can you prove it?

50:53.176 --> 50:55.145
Well, I'm the only one here.

50:55.614 --> 50:59.073
I think he kind of looks like a Jack,
if you ask me.

50:59.255 --> 51:01.019
No one is asking you.

51:01.092 --> 51:05.928
I knew a Jack once,
but he didn't look anything like him.

51:06.102 --> 51:07.730
Enough of this nonsense!
We're on a mission!

51:07.938 --> 51:11.136
If you are really Jack, you should be able
to answer one simple question.

51:12.181 --> 51:16.277
Two dragons are flying at the exact
same velocity as two Canadian barn owls

51:16.423 --> 51:19.086
with a combined weight
of 3.2 pounds before the moult.

51:19.595 --> 51:23.054
After 21 minutes and 33 seconds,
the first dragon meets up with the first owl.

51:23.170 --> 51:25.969
45 seconds later,
the second owl has lost 3 feathers.

51:26.109 --> 51:27.975
What time is it in Tirana?

51:28.080 --> 51:29.571
6.37 a.m.

51:29.649 --> 51:31.481
Absolutely right! Jack Pott!

51:31.653 --> 51:33.417
Now that that's settled,
could you unchain me?

51:33.557 --> 51:36.493
I really have to get back
to save princess Rose.

51:37.064 --> 51:39.090
But of course!
Time is of the essence, Gentlemen.

51:39.202 --> 51:41.171
- I say, we blow the chains up!
- Could you just...

51:41.406 --> 51:44.205
Maybe Ralphy could tear
the chains off the wall.

51:44.378 --> 51:46.176
Sure! It's like they say,

51:46.182 --> 51:48.981
Give me the place to stand
and I shall move the world.

51:49.088 --> 51:51.956
Maybe we should just detach his arm...

51:52.161 --> 51:56.292
Or we could wait for the sun
and melt the lock with a magnifying glass.

51:56.636 --> 51:59.504
HEY! Just use the key.

52:16.943 --> 52:19.139
By the way, who are you guys?

52:19.248 --> 52:22.150
Who are we? We are the 7 dwarfs!

52:23.190 --> 52:26.752
So, why are there only six of you?

52:29.936 --> 52:31.336
Where is Bobo?

53:39.942 --> 53:41.342
Oh oh!

53:48.126 --> 53:50.960
'Don't hurt me!
Don't hurt me! I'm your friend!

53:55.240 --> 53:57.471
This is pointless!

54:03.089 --> 54:06.116
You... you can talk?!?

54:06.562 --> 54:08.724
Of course I can talk.

54:09.168 --> 54:11.535
But no one ever wants to talk to me!

54:16.849 --> 54:18.818
But Dellamorta...

54:18.988 --> 54:21.082
She only gives me orders.

54:21.159 --> 54:23.628
Oh, you're Burner?

54:25.133 --> 54:27.500
My friends call me Burnie.

54:28.006 --> 54:30.976
Problem is I have no friends.

54:46.209 --> 54:47.768
What's wrong?

54:48.446 --> 54:50.312
I'm burnt out.

54:50.684 --> 54:51.447
Why?

54:51.652 --> 54:55.326
Dellamorta always makes me do things
I don't want to do.

54:55.327 --> 54:56.852
What kind of things?

54:57.064 --> 54:59.898
Bad things. You don't want to know.

55:03.309 --> 55:06.541
So just do things that you like.

55:09.655 --> 55:11.920
Forget it. No chance.

55:12.094 --> 55:13.960
Well, I like playing dwarf chess.

55:14.098 --> 55:19.002
Would you like to play?
It's a board game. It's easy!

55:20.277 --> 55:21.245
Check!

55:22.781 --> 55:24.249
Your turn!

55:24.885 --> 55:25.944
I don't want to.

55:26.122 --> 55:27.249
No?

55:27.357 --> 55:29.690
Then what would you like to do?

55:30.397 --> 55:32.059
- I'd like...
- Yeah?

55:32.200 --> 55:34.362
- Oh, I don't want to say.
- Why?

55:34.538 --> 55:37.838
Because it's not what real dragons do.

55:38.079 --> 55:39.342
Come on!

55:39.415 --> 55:41.281
- No.
- Please!

55:42.421 --> 55:45.482
- No.
- Pretty please!

55:45.894 --> 55:47.294
But don't laugh!

55:47.531 --> 55:50.660
- Never!
- I swear to you... If you laugh!

55:53.376 --> 55:56.471
I... like... tap dancing.

56:58.639 --> 57:00.403
Leave me alone!

57:00.410 --> 57:04.347
I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to laugh!

57:09.928 --> 57:11.362
Bobo!

57:13.736 --> 57:15.102
We've got Jack!

57:15.273 --> 57:16.332
Hello!

57:16.542 --> 57:17.942
Let's get out of here.

57:18.981 --> 57:21.384
Take cover, dwarfs!
Dragon at twelve o'clock.

57:21.385 --> 57:22.512
It's already twelve?

57:22.687 --> 57:25.282
Nonsense, we're on daylight savings time.

57:25.393 --> 57:26.486
Shut up!

57:27.497 --> 57:30.092
Ah, Jack Littleman. I need your help.

57:30.236 --> 57:32.034
The dragon wants to jump off the cliff.

57:33.142 --> 57:34.166
Really?

57:34.478 --> 57:35.377
Yes.

57:35.580 --> 57:36.741
Great!

57:37.384 --> 57:39.444
But it's MY fault.

57:40.323 --> 57:42.690
Well done! Back to Fantabularasa!

57:42.828 --> 57:46.196
You are a hero, Bobo!
Let's get back to Rose!

57:51.011 --> 57:53.105
But I have to help him.

57:54.852 --> 57:56.411
Bobo! Come back!

57:56.555 --> 58:00.390
Stop, stop, stop! Burnie!

58:01.465 --> 58:03.400
What did you just call me?

58:03.469 --> 58:05.665
Two good friends of mine once said,

58:05.807 --> 58:09.903
"You only got no chance
if you don't give yourself none."

58:10.617 --> 58:12.313
Nein!

01:01:20.396 --> 01:01:22.262
Now that really brings me down.

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:24.028
Dwarf catapult!

01:01:40.970 --> 01:01:43.667
Guys, a little help!

01:01:44.778 --> 01:01:46.303
Dwarfs!

01:01:49.788 --> 01:01:51.654
Here we go, here we go...
Alright... OK...

01:01:51.792 --> 01:01:53.158
Oh, guys!

01:01:54.064 --> 01:01:55.692
Jack come help us!

01:02:01.111 --> 01:02:06.709
I got it, I got it, I got it...
gooot iiit! I don't got it.

01:02:06.855 --> 01:02:08.619
A dwarf needs help!

01:02:28.298 --> 01:02:30.426
You saved us!

01:02:31.304 --> 01:02:34.206
Well... that's what friends are for!

01:02:34.444 --> 01:02:35.745
All for one...

01:02:35.746 --> 01:02:37.942
And all at once!

01:02:38.085 --> 01:02:40.054
Yeaaah!

01:02:40.389 --> 01:02:43.723
We can't waste time.
We have to get back to Fantabularasa.

01:02:43.862 --> 01:02:45.296
But... Dellamorta!

01:02:45.433 --> 01:02:48.926
I'm not afraid of that witch! And you?
What about you, guys?

01:02:49.174 --> 01:02:51.609
- Afraid?
- Us? I Nooo.

01:02:52.213 --> 01:02:52.942
Well...

01:02:53.182 --> 01:02:54.946
Concerned. Perhaps.

01:02:55.119 --> 01:02:57.213
If I'm to be honest...

01:02:57.457 --> 01:02:59.926
maybe we are afraid.

01:03:00.129 --> 01:03:03.065
But if you were on our side...

01:03:03.268 --> 01:03:06.727
If we really want
to win against Dellamorta,

01:03:08.111 --> 01:03:10.808
you're going to need weapons.

01:04:03.088 --> 01:04:05.114
And? Where is your weapon?

01:04:05.292 --> 01:04:05.452
Wait! Wait! Wait!
I... I just have to... I'm nearly finished.

01:04:19.053 --> 01:04:20.817
Come with me!

01:04:22.827 --> 01:04:26.696
The great big dragon flies in a circle,

01:04:27.903 --> 01:04:31.032
wraps his tail around itself

01:04:33.382 --> 01:04:37.285
and lets the little dwarf fly right through...

01:04:47.209 --> 01:04:48.370
here!

01:04:48.578 --> 01:04:52.106
I got it! I got it! I got it!

01:04:57.096 --> 01:05:00.555
I got it! I got it! I got it...

01:05:02.907 --> 01:05:06.275
Rose, my sword is out and here we come!

01:05:06.548 --> 01:05:10.110
Please place your pointy hats
in an upright position...

01:05:13.895 --> 01:05:15.989
Buuuuuurner!

01:05:18.138 --> 01:05:20.403
I'm not going to answer that.

01:05:49.167 --> 01:05:54.071
I hope you grilled that kitchen boy
like a piece of shrimp?!

01:05:56.514 --> 01:05:59.780
I smell dwarf! I hate dwarf!

01:05:59.921 --> 01:06:01.981
Is your head up your tail?

01:06:02.994 --> 01:06:06.590
You useless, lazy, overgrown.

01:06:07.937 --> 01:06:09.803
Lizard!

01:06:11.377 --> 01:06:13.676
I'll put you on ice...

01:06:14.717 --> 01:06:16.845
kitchen boy!

01:06:20.362 --> 01:06:23.457
Get away from my friend, you witch!

01:06:25.372 --> 01:06:27.034
Burner!

01:06:27.509 --> 01:06:31.503
You're treading on very thin ice!

01:06:40.035 --> 01:06:43.972
You come with me,
my delicious kitchen boy.

01:07:14.236 --> 01:07:15.670
Jack?

01:07:20.582 --> 01:07:22.949
No, Bobo, Stop! Stay where you are!

01:07:23.154 --> 01:07:24.122
Why?

01:07:24.290 --> 01:07:26.384
Don't go any further.

01:07:44.830 --> 01:07:47.129
We lost Burner.

01:07:47.236 --> 01:07:49.137
We lost Jack.

01:07:49.273 --> 01:07:51.970
- All is lost.
- You're right.

01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:57.986
Maybe not!

01:07:58.258 --> 01:08:00.386
The geysir will help us get out of here.

01:08:00.529 --> 01:08:02.555
Let's move the pot over to the crater.

01:08:05.038 --> 01:08:07.735
Move!

01:08:08.078 --> 01:08:10.445
Move!...

01:08:10.749 --> 01:08:13.309
Move!...

01:08:13.955 --> 01:08:15.082
No way!

01:08:16.194 --> 01:08:18.162
We need... we need...

01:08:18.363 --> 01:08:20.424
the floor polish.

01:08:29.854 --> 01:08:31.550
- Ralphy!
- Sure!

01:08:31.890 --> 01:08:33.154
Hep!

01:08:54.170 --> 01:08:55.694
You thought,

01:08:56.174 --> 01:09:01.578
you were no 'real' dragon,
because you could'nt spit fire.

01:09:02.152 --> 01:09:07.250
But to me you are the best
tapdancing dragon in the world!

01:09:19.086 --> 01:09:20.850
Bobo! It's about to blow!

01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:22.685
Bobo, hurry up!

01:09:28.337 --> 01:09:29.169
Hep!

01:09:38.291 --> 01:09:39.850
If my ballistic calculations are correct,

01:09:40.028 --> 01:09:42.622
our point of impact will be right in
the middle of the throne room.

01:09:42.733 --> 01:09:43.631
And if they're not?

01:09:43.768 --> 01:09:46.430
Then it won't be right in
the middle of the throne room.

01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:08.215
Perfect landing!

01:10:11.524 --> 01:10:13.117
Jack!

01:10:14.697 --> 01:10:16.325
Thank goodness!

01:10:16.534 --> 01:10:17.695
You're alive!

01:10:18.204 --> 01:10:21.402
Come, all you have to do now
is to kiss Rose...!

01:10:23.181 --> 01:10:27.642
Well, looky here! Visitors!

01:10:30.495 --> 01:10:33.397
Jack, Rose is counting on you.

01:10:33.634 --> 01:10:37.867
All right, let him kiss her
if he really wants to.

01:10:38.177 --> 01:10:41.341
Jack! What are you waiting for?...

01:10:41.517 --> 01:10:45.648
- A written invitation?
- I... love...

01:10:46.327 --> 01:10:48.159
Dellamorta.

01:10:49.133 --> 01:10:53.503
Apparently, the boy is under
the spell of my beauty.

01:10:53.641 --> 01:10:58.875
- I... love... Dellamorta.
- What have you done with him?

01:10:59.086 --> 01:11:02.215
- She hypnotized him.
- You're a meanie!

01:11:02.392 --> 01:11:06.227
- I... love... Dellamorta.
- Come here, my sweetheart.

01:11:08.304 --> 01:11:10.034
Excuse me, Princess.

01:11:10.575 --> 01:11:14.239
I love...

01:11:17.589 --> 01:11:18.579
Hey!

01:11:20.361 --> 01:11:23.263
I hate these punky heads.

01:11:28.044 --> 01:11:31.503
I... love...

01:11:58.404 --> 01:12:02.808
I... love... er...Rooooose!

01:12:02.913 --> 01:12:06.315
No! You just wait!

01:12:10.728 --> 01:12:13.391
Hey, you bring it on!

01:12:46.333 --> 01:12:49.303
This one will make you undefeatable.

01:12:55.852 --> 01:12:57.411
Uopsi!

01:13:03.334 --> 01:13:06.634
- I fear, we are about to loose.
- Not necessarily.

01:13:06.907 --> 01:13:09.342
This potion will make you undefeatable.

01:13:09.513 --> 01:13:11.277
Interesting point.

01:13:12.385 --> 01:13:15.583
You're not kissing anyone awake!

01:13:15.725 --> 01:13:18.388
- Get him out of my sight.
- No.

01:13:36.533 --> 01:13:38.399
Burni! You're alive.

01:13:38.604 --> 01:13:42.541
One for all and all at once!

01:13:45.384 --> 01:13:49.515
Well, well, well, I'm very impressed!
How did you get here?

01:13:49.793 --> 01:13:52.388
Somebody left the gate open!

01:14:10.434 --> 01:14:13.563
My Lady, I hereby resign.

01:14:21.023 --> 01:14:23.720
Oops... A great vintage...

01:14:38.557 --> 01:14:42.927
Jack! Jack! Come out, wherever you are!

01:14:48.477 --> 01:14:49.945
Bobo, hey, come here!

01:14:50.081 --> 01:14:53.415
Did you make sure that kitchen boy
doesn't get to the princess!?

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:56.080
Bobo, I need you to distract the witch.

01:15:30.494 --> 01:15:32.258
And now?

01:15:33.534 --> 01:15:35.503
What happens now?

01:15:38.811 --> 01:15:39.835
I don't know.

01:15:39.981 --> 01:15:42.007
But every time my shoe laces are undone,

01:15:42.285 --> 01:15:45.483
there's chaos and something goes wrong.

01:15:49.632 --> 01:15:51.498
Catch the dwarrrrf!

01:15:52.672 --> 01:15:54.004
Oh, hi there!

01:15:54.676 --> 01:15:56.508
My love...

01:15:56.981 --> 01:15:58.973
Stand still, mortal!

01:16:04.863 --> 01:16:05.592
No,

01:16:06.533 --> 01:16:09.025
no. Watch out, Jack!

01:16:10.374 --> 01:16:13.674
Noooo...

01:16:28.210 --> 01:16:29.542
Bobo!

01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:36.625
- Is he...? Is he...?
- He hit his head.

01:16:36.626 --> 01:16:39.619
Oh no, he wasn't wearing his hat.

01:16:41.069 --> 01:16:42.662
I can't look!

01:16:50.955 --> 01:16:52.821
Here. I got it!

01:17:05.684 --> 01:17:07.550
Check!... Mate!

01:20:53.773 --> 01:20:57.039
And they all lived happily ever after.

01:20:57.281 --> 01:20:59.443
Does anyone have a light?

01:20:59.987 --> 01:21:01.353
Sure!

01:21:05.063 --> 01:21:07.191
- Burni!
- Oops!

01:21:18.823 --> 01:21:20.291
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:20.984
Hugh?

01:21:21.162 --> 01:21:23.495
- What now, Bobo?
- Nothing

01:21:24.305 --> 01:21:30.226
