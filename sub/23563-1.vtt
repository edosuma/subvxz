I'd like to have my gun back, Dee.

47:10.280 --> 47:12.236
Robbie.

47:31.240 --> 47:36.109
Still picking up after your brother.
Mama would be proud of that.

47:36.560 --> 47:38.755
Seen Mama lately?

47:39.160 --> 47:41.549
Not since the funeral.

47:42.400 --> 47:43.674
Mama's dead?

47:43.880 --> 47:47.555
I buried her six weeks to the day
after Appomattox.

47:47.720 --> 47:49.790
It was raining.

47:52.240 --> 47:55.471
- She didn't suffer?
- Only in her mind.

47:57.520 --> 48:00.990
- Because of me, you mean.
- You're the one who said that.

48:01.160 --> 48:04.038
I killed her. That's what you mean.

48:04.480 --> 48:08.189
You never did her any good, Dee.
That's what I mean.

48:08.560 --> 48:11.074
The day she found
you joined Quantrill...

48:11.240 --> 48:14.391
...she started going downhill
for the last time.

48:14.560 --> 48:17.313
And when you fellows burnt
Lawrence, Kansas...

48:17.520 --> 48:20.398
...after that, she never spoke
another word. She just...

48:20.560 --> 48:22.949
...sat by the fire...

48:23.280 --> 48:25.555
...and didn't say anything.

48:26.800 --> 48:30.110
Hey, Robbie. Here's a mama for you.

48:30.280 --> 48:33.795
One boy goes with Quantrill,
the other goes with Sherman.

48:33.960 --> 48:37.236
One helps burn down a town,
the other helps burn down a state.

48:37.440 --> 48:40.716
The one that burned the town
is the one that done in his mama.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.878
Sherman was war, Dee.

48:44.040 --> 48:46.918
Quantrill was meanness.

48:53.320 --> 48:55.788
Well, what about this big sheriff
and his bunch?

48:55.960 --> 48:58.110
Think he's gonna cross the border?

49:00.200 --> 49:04.318
A South Texas sheriff who once
rode with Nathan Bedford Forrest.

49:04.480 --> 49:08.393
A man who was made a fool of
in his own town.

49:08.560 --> 49:10.755
He'll cross it.

50:10.080 --> 50:12.469
If there's something
you know that we don't...

50:12.640 --> 50:15.837
...I think you'd better tell us
what it is. You're with us.

50:16.000 --> 50:21.028
Whatever happens to us happens to you.
Maybe even more so.

50:23.240 --> 50:27.028
The country we have been through
between here and the Rio Grande...

50:27.200 --> 50:30.192
...is patrolled by the federales.

50:30.360 --> 50:34.638
From here to south
is the territorio bandolero.

50:34.800 --> 50:37.917
Well, what's that,
"territorio bandolero"?

50:38.080 --> 50:43.234
Bandit country.
They kill every gringo they can find.

50:43.720 --> 50:47.474
- You don't look too worried.
- I am not a gringo.

50:50.040 --> 50:53.476
Well, there's a town called
Sabinas just south of here.

50:53.640 --> 50:57.349
- It is a three-day ride.
- We'll be safe there.

50:57.520 --> 50:59.988
The sheriff won't follow us
that deep in.

51:00.160 --> 51:02.071
He will follow.

51:02.240 --> 51:04.390
What makes you so certain?

51:04.560 --> 51:08.439
Because you have something
he has wanted for a long time.

51:08.600 --> 51:12.149
- What's that?
- Me.

51:47.080 --> 51:51.039
Four, maybe five hours.

52:09.000 --> 52:12.629
This is the first time I have been
in my country since I left.

52:12.800 --> 52:15.917
I always knew
I would come back again...

52:16.080 --> 52:18.514
...but not quite this way.

52:19.120 --> 52:23.557
How'd you come to marry
your husband, Mrs. Stoner?

52:25.800 --> 52:28.439
He bought me, Mr. Bishop.

52:28.600 --> 52:31.797
He found me in the backroom
of a cantina.

52:31.960 --> 52:35.953
He liked me, and he bought me.

52:36.400 --> 52:40.678
He gave my father five cows
and a gun.

52:40.920 --> 52:44.037
It made my father the richest man
in our village.

52:44.840 --> 52:47.434
Did you ever come to love him?

52:48.400 --> 52:50.072
No.

52:50.680 --> 52:53.194
But he was kind to me.

52:53.360 --> 52:55.999
He was considerate.

52:56.320 --> 53:00.154
And he took me from something
I never felt a part of.

53:00.520 --> 53:03.080
He gave me a home.

53:03.520 --> 53:05.112
Now here I am.

53:05.320 --> 53:10.872
Well, from the looks of you, Mrs. Stoner,
you have a long way yet to go.

53:12.360 --> 53:14.920
- Want some coffee?
- No.

53:15.080 --> 53:16.911
Excuse me.

54:01.840 --> 54:05.879
Mace, if you're ever alone
with Pop and his little boy...

54:06.040 --> 54:08.713
...don't you turn your back on them.
- I know.

54:08.880 --> 54:11.269
I can't decide which of us
they hate the most.

54:11.480 --> 54:14.597
- Oh, it's you.
- I think you're right.

54:14.960 --> 54:19.875
Mace, I ain't had a chance to tell you,
but it sure is real good to see you again.

54:20.040 --> 54:24.113
And sometimes I think back
to how it used to be with you and me.

54:24.280 --> 54:27.716
- You remember when...?
- Dee, that was yesterday.

54:27.920 --> 54:30.957
Now, let's talk about today.

54:31.120 --> 54:34.317
All right. What about today?

54:34.480 --> 54:37.950
Now, why do you ride
with men like these?

54:38.680 --> 54:42.195
Oh, I don't know. I just got used to it,
I guess, through the years.

54:42.360 --> 54:45.750
You know, you begin to go one way
and keep on going that way...

54:45.920 --> 54:48.115
...pretty soon, there's no other way.

54:48.320 --> 54:50.675
You really believe that?

54:51.400 --> 54:54.358
No, I guess not.

55:00.440 --> 55:02.670
BABE: You sure are pretty.
- Pretty.

55:02.880 --> 55:05.997
A pretty woman ain't good
for nothing but smelling sweet...

55:06.160 --> 55:08.469
...and laying around the house.

55:08.840 --> 55:10.273
Just so pretty.

55:10.480 --> 55:14.359
Is it after a little kiss you are, Babe?
Oh, he's a great kisser, ma'am.

55:14.520 --> 55:17.318
He's the best damn lady-kisser
in the whole of Texas.

55:17.480 --> 55:18.879
[MEN LAUGHING]

55:19.040 --> 55:21.156
Leave the woman alone.

55:21.360 --> 55:22.679
Oh...

55:22.840 --> 55:26.389
Hell, he wouldn't harm a hair
on her head, laddie.

55:26.600 --> 55:30.479
She's a lady. Treat her like one.

55:42.040 --> 55:44.190
It's time you got some sleep.

56:10.320 --> 56:12.754
How far are we going, July?

56:12.920 --> 56:14.797
I mean, are we just gonna...

56:14.960 --> 56:17.633
...keep following them
till we come up on them...

56:17.800 --> 56:19.711
...or what?
No matter how far they go?

56:19.880 --> 56:21.552
That's right.

56:21.720 --> 56:24.029
Suppose they just keep
going on forever?

56:24.200 --> 56:26.555
Then we'll just keep going on forever.

56:26.720 --> 56:28.711
What if we lose them?

56:29.120 --> 56:31.998
There's only a couple of places
they could be headed.

56:32.160 --> 56:34.754
There's only a couple of places
with water.

56:34.920 --> 56:37.115
I won't lose them.

56:37.320 --> 56:43.236
I'll find them, or I'll find their bones,
but I won't lose them.

57:23.440 --> 57:25.670
HAWKINS:
Hold up, July!

57:27.320 --> 57:29.231
This don't make sense no more, July.

57:29.440 --> 57:32.876
- What don't make sense, Hawkins?
- We've come too far already.

57:33.040 --> 57:36.794
Ain't no telling where we'll end up,
dead most likely, if we keep going.

57:36.960 --> 57:38.234
You wanna turn back?

57:38.400 --> 57:42.313
Wanting ain't part of it.
I'm turning back.

57:42.480 --> 57:44.710
Anybody going with me?

57:47.040 --> 57:49.315
Ain't nobody coming with me?

57:52.520 --> 57:54.397
Maybe he's right, Johnson.

57:54.560 --> 57:58.519
It don't make no sense no more.
I mean, it just don't make sense.

57:59.160 --> 58:02.436
Goodbye, Ross, Hawkins.

58:06.240 --> 58:08.435
HAWKINS:
You coming with us?

58:20.560 --> 58:24.269
It's not the Bishop gang he's after now,
it's the Stoner woman.

58:24.440 --> 58:26.032
Just like Carter said.

59:17.360 --> 59:20.318
Hey! Wait up there! Wait for me!

59:21.040 --> 59:25.352
What are you hurrying so for? That sheriff
can't go any faster than we can.

59:25.520 --> 59:27.238
Are you giving out, Pop?

59:27.400 --> 59:32.315
Oh, it's just that I don't see no sense
in hurrying, that's all.

59:32.480 --> 59:36.473
So the old bastardo is not as tough
as he smells.

59:59.560 --> 01:00:01.915
How can two brothers be so different?

01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:05.356
Who, Mace? Oh, he believes
in the goodness of his fellow man.

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:07.670
He's never seen it,
but he believes in it.

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:09.910
I don't believe in it.

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:12.594
- What do you believe in?
- I believe in myself.

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:16.548
You fool nobody but yourself.
And I don't believe you even do that.

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:19.632
You really think you had a hard life,
don't you, Dee?

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:22.314
- You don't understand.
- No?

01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:25.631
What would you know about
having to scrape for a living?

01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:28.109
I could tell you a lot
about the hard life...

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:30.669
...but you'd have to live it
to understand it.

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:32.478
Yes, I believe that.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.956
CORT:
Johnson!

01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:57.590
We ain't going no further. This is it.

01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:00.075
We're turning back.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.637
- All of you?
- All of us.

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:07.349
- You just ain't gonna find them.
- I'll find them.

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:11.229
Do you know how big this country is?
Why, it just swallowed them up.

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:13.709
- For all we know, they...
- Now, who's missing?

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:17.475
We came into that pass with 10 men.
I count eight of us now.

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:20.958
Clyde Anderson ain't with us, July.

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:24.118
Wade Phillips is missing too.

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:30.159
July.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.869
All right, Cort, you and the men can
ride back home if you want to.

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:47.235
Course, that's the only way.

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:50.358
Unless you wanna ride
50 miles around.

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:59.553
All right, then.
You stay here till we get back.

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:31.711
Stay where you are.
You wouldn't recognize him anyway.

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:37.151
I reckon the other one's
around here somewhere.

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:41.950
- The Indians, July?
- No, bandits.

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:48.157
If you wanna ride for home,
you leave right now from here.

01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:52.108
I'll understand. I'll tell the others
I sent you home to report.

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:54.199
I'll stay with you, July.

01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:58.239
Now, you don't have to.
I just want you to know that.

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.231
No, I'll stick.

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:02.550
Then if anybody ever says to me:

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:06.508
"Did you ride all over Mexico
with July Johnson?"

01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:09.114
I can say to him, "Yep...

01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:14.033
...I rode all over Mexico
with July Johnson."

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:20.669
You're a good boy. I always said it.

01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:38.077
You stop picking your nose, boy.
It ain't mannerly.

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:41.710
- You had no call to do that.
- Now, none of your lip.

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:44.952
You're raising up your boy
to be a good Christian, I see.

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:47.793
POP: I'm learning him
what my pa learned me.

01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:50.872
The Almighty rest his damn bones.

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:53.999
There's three things
a man ought never do:

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:58.790
Spit in church, scratch himself
in front of his ma...

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:01.875
...and pick his nose. Yes, sir.

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:06.830
That's what my pa learned me,
and it stood me in good stead.

01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:09.790
I don't imagine your pa
ever mentioned...

01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:13.236
...shooting people and burning houses
and things like that.

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:17.228
I'm talking about mannerly things,
Mr. Bishop.

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:20.392
I ain't talking about making a living.

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:21.788
Oh.

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:31.910
What the hell, Bishop?

01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:34.230
You were leaning on my saddle,
Mr. Chaney.

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:36.595
You lean on your own saddle.

01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:39.320
Babe, get out there
and see if anything's moving.

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:41.238
Dee.

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:52.398
- Something wrong?
- Things have been wrong a long time.

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:55.438
Don't you think it's about time
we have a talk?

01:05:55.600 --> 01:06:00.628
- Well, I'll tell you the truth...
- Yeah, liars always start that way.

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:03.030
No, Mace, I'll tell you the truth.

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:06.237
I can't remember a single instance
where talking's ever...

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:07.674
...gotten me anyplace.

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:11.549
But go ahead. Tell me what you wanna
talk about, maybe I'll join you.

01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:15.554
All right. I wanna talk about us
having a place of our own.

01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:18.109
Our own ranch.
How's that sound to you?

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:20.111
Not worth a rooster without a hen.

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:23.397
How come? Seems to me
I can remember back to a time...

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:26.028
...you wanted a place
of your own awful bad.

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:28.589
That was before the war.
We were younger then.

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:30.352
Well, not that much younger.

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:32.829
Young enough to think
about a good woman.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:37.039
You know how long it's been since
I been with a woman I could respect?

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:42.836
I may not be good, but I sure do know
what good's supposed to be.

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:46.669
We were young enough back in
those days to think about children.

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:49.348
You're not saying
you're too old to be a father?

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:53.433
I'm just saying you reach a time
when all them things are lost to you.

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:57.036
They're not lost to you, Dee.
They're not lost.

01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:00.590
You may have thrown some of them
away. They're not lost to you.

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:36.273
DEE:
Get up, Babe.

01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:37.589
[SCREAMS]

01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:39.478
Get up!

01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:48.277
Honest, Dee, I wasn't gonna do
nothing but kiss her.

01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:50.954
Well, what's wrong
with a little old kiss?

01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:54.032
Ain't nothing wrong
with a little old kiss, Dee.

01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:56.634
A little old kiss never hurt nobody.

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:24.037
From now on, you and me are gonna be
close together whether you like it or not.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.560
I can't stand the thought
of something like him...

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:47.790
...with his hands
on something like you.

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:50.234
I thought he was your friend.

01:08:50.399 --> 01:08:53.596
He is, but that don't make him
any less disgusting.

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:56.877
Matter of fact,
all my friends are disgusting.

01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:58.917
You take Pop, for instance.

01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:01.957
He was due to be shot
the day he was born.

01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:06.033
And that heart of his is nothing
but a festering sore.

01:09:06.319 --> 01:09:09.710
His kid, he's something, ain't he?

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:14.549
If you feel that way about them,
why are you with them?

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:16.870
I know where they stand.

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:19.917
I've never known
where respectable people stood.

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:23.117
Maybe they don't know themselves.

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:26.752
You say the sheriff's
always wanted you?

01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:29.832
He is a good man.

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:31.515
I...

01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:34.796
I reckon he's got you
all to himself now.

01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:39.908
He's a good man,
but I feel nothing for him.

01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:41.993
[CHUCKLES]

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:44.631
Why do you laugh?

01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:50.352
I was just thinking. We'd make
a perfect pair, you and me.

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:53.318
I'm broke, without a woman...

01:09:53.479 --> 01:09:56.358
...and you're rich and without a man.

01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:47.272
- This ain't Sabinas, is it, laddie?
- Is this what you brung us to?

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:34.876
DEE: This is the town.
MACE: Why, it's a ghost.

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:39.591
DEE: Looks that way, Mace.
Sure does look that way.

01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:47.668
MACE: A lot of horses
through here lately, Dee.

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:51.152
Maybe not more than a day or so.

01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:54.314
Mostly barefoot.

01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:58.395
This is your country. What do you
think happened to these people?

01:11:58.560 --> 01:11:59.913
Bandoleros.

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:02.715
They demand too much of the people.

01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:05.440
When they grow tired
of being raided, they leave.

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:07.079
As they have done here.

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:10.198
You mean to say a whole town
just packs up and leaves...

01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:11.679
...and never comes back?

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:14.070
Well, sometimes
they go to a larger town...

01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:17.755
...where they can be protected
by the soldiers of Benito Juarez.

01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:23.040
Mace, we'll put up over in that cantina.
That's the best place around.

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:07.795
What do you plan on doing now, Dee?

01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:12.158
Well, I'll just rest up here
a few days...

01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:16.836
...ride on to Hidalgo for supplies
and push on to Matamoros.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.560
I got friends in Matamoros.

01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:22.359
Well, what about Mrs. Stoner?

01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:30.875
Mace, you think we could
make a go of it in Montana?

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:34.396
Dee, there's a town up there
called Missoula.

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:37.438
- Prettiest place you ever saw.
- What about the Indians?

01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:41.195
And the Rockies, they're snowcapped,
and the slopes are forested...

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:44.557
...and there are lots of lakes and...
- What about the Indians?

01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:46.551
And there's deer in Montana, Dee.

01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:48.278
And antelope and elk...

01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:51.876
- Mace, what about the Indians?
...and black bear and...

01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:53.712
What Indians?

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:56.633
Ain't there no Indians in Montana?

01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:59.758
Well, a few.

01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:02.195
Ain't there Northern Cheyenne
in Montana?

01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:05.875
The Northern...
Well, the Northern Cheyenne...

01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:09.396
- I wouldn't lie to you.
- The Crow and the Sioux?

01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:12.154
- Well, they're around.
- What else, Mace?

01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:14.749
- Listen, Dee...
- What else?

01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:18.515
Well, the Blackfeet...

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:21.433
...and Chippewa.
- Some Cree?

01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:23.870
Yes. Yes, there are Cree in Montana.

01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:27.038
And the Shoshone and the Kootenai
and the Stoney.

01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:29.077
Just what are you trying to say?

01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:33.239
I'm trying to say there's a lot of
goddamn Indians in Montana, Mace.

01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:37.154
- You're impossible to talk to.
- Wait a minute.

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:39.311
Will you sit down, Mace?

01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:43.510
I'm tired, Mace. Bone-tired.

01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:47.195
I can't even remember what it feels like
to get up in the morning...

01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:50.432
...feeling rested and clean,
having a good breakfast.

01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:52.556
I can't remember
what it feels like...

01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:56.992
...to slip down in between
some cool, clean sheets.

01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:01.596
Mace, we'll need money.
Have you thought about that?

01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:04.911
I think I know where I can get
my hands on some.

01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:07.310
Your brother won't never make it.

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:09.391
There's only one way for him...

01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:13.235
...for me, for any of us.

01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:18.588
MACE:
Well, what way is that, Mr. Chaney?

01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:22.070
This way. The way we know.

01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:24.674
The way we growed.

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:29.833
Well, now, that may be so for you,
but for my brother, it's different.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.958
I don't care if he is your brother.
The son of a bitch...

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:39.476
Now...

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:44.630
...before you apologize, I'm gonna
tell you something, Mr. Chaney.

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:48.475
My brother and I are the sons
of an honest dirt farmer.

01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:51.638
A man who slaved all his life
from sunup to sundown...

01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:54.712
...and never took time
except to deliver his children...

01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:59.192
...and go to meeting on Sunday.
A man who died of old age at 45...

01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:03.512
...and who never saw more than
$ 10 at one time in his whole life.

01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:06.877
We're the sons of a woman
that married him for his goodness...

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:09.031
...because she was good!

01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:13.239
And now you can apologize
for slandering my family, Mr. Chaney.

01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:16.233
I'll blow your head off.

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:24.398
You ain't no killer.
You ain't got the stomach for it.

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:26.994
Apologize!

01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:32.831
I'm sorry, Mr. Bishop.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.912
I didn't mean no harm.

01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:46.159
I'm going outside, Dee.

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:50.279
I'd appreciate it if you see
I don't get shot in the back.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.638
- July?
- Mmm?

01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:18.108
What if she won't have you?

01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:21.472
Why shouldn't she have me?

01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:26.589
Well, I don't know.
It's just, she might not want you.

01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:30.589
You trying to tell me something, Roscoe?

01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:32.796
No, July, it's just...

01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:35.599
Well, because you want her
doesn't mean that...

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:38.593
...she's gotta want you right back.

01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:41.877
Does it?

01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:46.877
I don't wanna talk about it.

01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:49.118
- Why?
- What?

01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:52.477
- Why don't you wanna talk about it?
- Roscoe, I just don't.

01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:56.315
Now, Roscoe, you been
a good boy all of these years.

01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:01.239
Now, don't spoil it.

01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:09.159
Who's standing guard?

01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:11.990
Jeeters.

01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:16.711
Well, I reckon I'll go spell him.

01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:10.792
MACE: Well, there's another one'll
never make it to Matamoros.

01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:13.918
DEE: How many does that make?
- Three.

01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:18.835
Looks to me like we'll be
mostly walking when we leave.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.912
You two have gotten pretty close,
haven't you?

01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:30.232
- Nothing's been said.
- Well, nothing has to be said.

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:34.393
It's just a feeling, Mace.
You know, it's just a feeling, but...

01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:36.437
But what?

01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:39.433
I don't know if she has
the same feeling.

01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:42.239
Have you thought about asking her?

01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:44.789
- Asking?
- Dee...

01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:47.315
...I know you don't believe in talking...

01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:50.438
...and you've said that talking
never got you anywhere...

01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:53.273
...but how are you ever gonna
find out anything...

01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:56.637
...from anybody if you don't talk?

01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:16.353
There will be coffee soon.

01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:20.189
- I wanna ask you something.
- Yes?

01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:23.875
I know I've done you real wrong...

01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:26.708
...and even if I wanted...

01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:29.872
...it's kind of late for apologizing.

01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:33.359
I know there's no reason
in this whole world...

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:36.671
...why you wouldn't like to
step on something like me...

01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:41.108
...but do you think you could ever
take to a man who...

01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:45.990
...dragged you from your home
and done you the way I done you?

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:09.833
Well, I'll be damned.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:13.276
- What'd she say?
- Nothing.

01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:15.715
Oh, well, you two are gonna be
very happy.

01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:17.472
Mace, what'd she mean by that?

01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:20.552
She just looked at me, hugged me.
Didn't say nothing.

01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:22.199
Oh, boy.

01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:26.194
Oh, you're a sorry...
Dee, you're so dumb.

01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:27.998
- I am?
- Yes, you are.

01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:32.199
- How'd you like a knock in your teeth?
- No, listen to me, Dee.

01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:35.033
Do you wanna go up to Montana
with me or don't you?

01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:37.873
Do you wanna help me build
our spread up there?

01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:40.793
- I reckon, yeah.
- And the children, what about them?

01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:42.871
- What children?
- Children of your own.

01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:45.270
The ones you used to want.
What about them?

01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:48.079
And her? Do you want her
to go with you to Montana?

01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:51.471
- It'd be right nice, yeah.
- Well, then go and tell her.

01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:56.111
You're right. That's right, Mace.
Now, why didn't I think of that?

01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:01.197
ROSCOE:
Bishop, close the door.

01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:24.991
Come on in.

01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:30.914
All right, tell them it's over, Roscoe.

01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:50.516
Now, just so we understand
one another...

01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:53.831
...you make one move
I don't like, and I'll kill you.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.594
Now, what's your real name?

01:23:56.760 --> 01:24:00.548
- Mace Bishop.
- Bishop. You're brothers.

01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:03.234
You hear that, Roscoe?
They're brothers.

01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:07.792
All right, brothers.
Where'd you hide the bank money?

01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:12.112
- What bank money?
- Oh, it's gonna be that way, is it?

01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:18.150
The $ 10,000 your brother there
took out of the Val Verde Bank.

01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:21.955
$ 10,000 that he helped himself to
when the rest of you lit out.

01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:24.628
That's what bank money.

01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:28.236
You robbed a bank? You, Mace?

01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:30.994
Well, Dee, the bank was there...

01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:35.517
...and I was there, and there wasn't
very much of anybody else there...

01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:38.752
...and it just seemed like
the thing to do.

01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:42.390
You know, it's not like
something you never heard of.

01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:49.428
Lot of people rob banks
for all sorts of different reasons.

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:52.797
You just walked into a bank
and helped yourself to $ 10,000...

01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:55.349
...because it seemed like
the thing to do?

01:24:55.520 --> 01:25:00.719
That's about the way it was, yeah.
That's as well as I can remember, yeah.

01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:02.792
I don't know what to say to you.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.878
Well, just don't say anything, Dee.
Don't say a word.

01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:07.752
Why, you old bastard.

01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:12.038
Now I know what you meant by,
"I might be able to get some money."

01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:14.395
You planned on us...

01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:17.358
We were gonna start our new spread
on stolen money?

01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:20.193
Just a thought, Dee. Just a thought.

01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:23.512
Well, I'm sure glad Mama
ain't around to hear all this.

01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:27.793
Well, I sure wish Papa
was around to hear all this.

01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:31.794
Wouldn't it be wonderful to see
$ 10,000 in Papa's hands?

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.434
$ 10,000 in the hands of a man...

01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:37.956
...that didn't know there was that
much money in the whole world.

01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:41.675
I think I'm gonna be
sick to my stomach.

01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:45.270
Tie them up. Tie them all up!

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.151
We're going home in the morning,
ain't we, July?

01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:10.950
I sure hope so.

01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:20.510
JOHNSON: I've found a place
for you to sleep tonight, ma'am.

01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:22.750
I don't mind sleeping here.

01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:27.078
Oh, yes, ma'am,
but I don't think you should.

01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:30.199
It just don't seem right, somehow.

01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:54.116
Right over there.

01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:04.238
Now, there's no need to worry. There'll
be somebody on guard all night long.

01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:16.678
Now, this isn't much,
but it's the best I could find.

01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:18.990
You'll be safe here.

01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:21.515
I was not worried about my safety.

01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:24.478
You don't have to be with
them Bishops now.

01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:28.239
You know, I like them.

01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:30.436
Beg your pardon, ma'am?

01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:35.871
I said, I like them. Both of them.

01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:45.269
I'd like to talk to you
about something, Maria.

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:48.877
You have ridden a long way
for nothing if it was for me.

01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:51.310
- Look, I'm stable.
- I know.

01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:54.153
- And I'm reliable.
- I know, July, but don't you...?

01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:56.436
Roscoe said just because I like you...

01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:59.797
...you don't have to like me back,
and that's the truth, but...

01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:05.713
Oh, what are you looking for, ma'am?

01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:07.797
Nothing.

01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:12.080
I have found it.

01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:32.752
You men!
Pack all the water we can tote.

01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:35.718
Throw away everything we don't need.

01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:44.391
All right, I'm gonna ask you again.

01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:46.630
And I don't wanna hear
about your mama.

01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:51.032
I don't wanna hear nothing about
how disappointed you are in each other.

01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:54.676
I don't wanna hear nothing about
how the Lord will forgive you...

01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:57.434
...for sinking so low.
Where'd you hide the money?

01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:04.950
You know, it'd go a lot easier on you
if you told me where it was hid.

01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:07.515
What about my brother?

01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:10.877
Money or no money,
your brother's gonna hang.

01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:14.114
Your kind don't live long
in prison, Mace.

01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:16.191
Why don't you tell him where it is.

01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:18.555
Go on, give it to him.

01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:26.150
Well, sheriff...

01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:29.596
...I figure if I ever want money
bad enough again...

01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:31.955
...I can always rob another bank.

01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:34.270
I never knew it was so easy.

01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:35.839
Come on, help me up.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:39.072
Don't do it, Bishop.
We'll get you out of this.

01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:41.794
You ain't getting out of nothing,
so shut up.

01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:44.155
It's a long way to the border, sheriff...

01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:47.517
...and I'm gonna take special pleasure
in cutting your...

01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:51.193
Tough world, isn't it, Mr. Chaney?

01:29:56.480 --> 01:29:58.550
There it is...

01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:01.029
...resting like a baby.

01:30:02.680 --> 01:30:05.638
Is that really the best
you could hide it?

01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:12.676
Go tell July we're ready.

- Untie us!
- Get back on the floor!

01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:53.908
Come on, sheriff,
untie us and give us guns!

01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:56.469
You'll never hold off that many!

01:30:57.960 --> 01:31:01.396
- All right, Cort, turn them loose!
- Come on!

All right, Dee.

Pa.

01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:03.358
Leave me be, boy!

MACE:
Pa! Get back in here!

01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:24.755
I hope they kill you, you hear me?
I hope you die!

My God.

When you hugged me,
did that mean yes or no?

01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:36.079
It meant yes.

01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:40.273
You really would've been my woman?
My wife, I mean?

01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:42.032
Yes.

01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:45.875
- You'd have gone to Montana with us?
- Yes.

Did you hear that, Mace?

01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:55.715
You here, Mace?

I'm here, Dee.

Did you mean what you said
to my brother?

For the first time in my life.

I'm awful glad.

It just...

It was always hard for Dee to see
the light at the end of the trail.
