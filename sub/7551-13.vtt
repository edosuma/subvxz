00:46.142 --> 00:48.509
What are you doing to my desk?

00:48.543 --> 00:50.912
Beckett: Oh, uh, well,
Gates is on vacation,

00:50.946 --> 00:53.714
so I figured why not do
my paperwork from home

00:53.749 --> 00:55.115
with my husband?

00:55.150 --> 00:57.718
That is, if you want to play hooky with me.

00:57.753 --> 01:00.087
Is it technically playing
hooky if we're working?

01:00.121 --> 01:03.857
Well, we could work for a bit
and then maybe take a nap.

01:03.892 --> 01:06.093
Oh, I like naps.

01:06.127 --> 01:07.227
[Cellphone rings] Yeah, naps are good.

01:07.262 --> 01:08.862
Hang on.

01:08.897 --> 01:12.032
Oh,
it's a call forwarded from the P.I. office.

01:12.066 --> 01:14.133
Richard Castle Investigations.

01:14.153 --> 01:15.704
Speaking.

01:15.828 --> 01:17.271
Yes.

01:17.702 --> 01:19.891
Oh, great. I will see you in 20 minutes.

01:19.911 --> 01:20.874
All right. Bye.

01:20.909 --> 01:22.876
[Beep] Well, for once in the relationship,

01:22.911 --> 01:24.711
I'm the one getting the call.

01:24.745 --> 01:27.047
- I have a potential client.
- Castle, that's fantastic.

01:27.081 --> 01:29.382
No, it's not.
No, I was gonna spend the day with you.

01:29.417 --> 01:31.270
It's fine. It's not like I
don't leave at a moment's notice

01:31.290 --> 01:32.771
when there's a homicide.

01:32.791 --> 01:35.188
Well, then maybe if I'm done soon,

01:35.223 --> 01:37.857
I can swing by later for, you know, a nap.

01:37.892 --> 01:39.192
If you do, you'll be napping alone.

01:39.227 --> 01:41.194
Because if you're going to your office,
then I'm going to mine.

01:41.229 --> 01:44.096
- Oh.
- Knock 'em dead, babe.

01:51.871 --> 01:52.972
Hey.

01:53.007 --> 01:54.007
Well, hello, there.

01:54.041 --> 01:56.208
You must be Mrs. Whitfield.
I'm Richard Castle.

01:56.243 --> 01:58.210
Ooh, ouch. What happened there?

01:58.245 --> 02:00.126
[Laughs] Just cut myself.

02:00.146 --> 02:02.681
Richard. Really?

02:02.715 --> 02:04.883
Come on, Richard Rodgers,
you really don't remember me?

02:04.918 --> 02:09.163
Faircroft Prep, A.P. chem...
I used to cheat off you.

02:09.183 --> 02:11.623
Eva! Eva Hendricks! Eva, yeah.

02:11.658 --> 02:13.892
[Laughs] Well, I'm...
I'm Eva Whitfield now.

02:13.927 --> 02:16.201
- Oh, yeah. I'm Richard Castle now.
- I know. I've read your books,

02:16.221 --> 02:17.863
followed your adventures with the NYPD.

02:17.897 --> 02:19.447
I heard you were a P.I.

02:20.166 --> 02:22.534
So, well, I, uh...

02:22.569 --> 02:25.238
Uh, why don't we go inside and talk?

02:26.256 --> 02:29.240
So, Eva, tell me, what can I do for you?

02:29.275 --> 02:32.858
Um, it's my husband, Cole.

02:33.267 --> 02:35.880
- What about him?
- He's a stockbroker.

02:35.914 --> 02:38.249
He's, um... he's bright.
He's handsome, charming.

02:38.284 --> 02:40.418
We got married, and it was so wonderful.

02:40.453 --> 02:42.687
Um, but then, in the last few years,

02:42.721 --> 02:45.837
it's gotten [Sighs] so difficult.

02:46.160 --> 02:48.207
I'm sorry.

02:48.592 --> 02:51.428
Rick, I think he's cheating on me.

02:52.513 --> 02:54.896
And what makes you think that?

02:55.182 --> 02:57.174
[Sniffles] The way he acts, um...

02:57.194 --> 02:58.836
The hours he keeps.

02:58.870 --> 03:01.538
I mean, I should have known it was coming.
He insisted on a prenup.

03:01.573 --> 03:03.107
[Breathes deeply] I just...

03:03.141 --> 03:04.842
I have to find out the truth.

03:04.876 --> 03:07.043
Can you help me?

03:07.969 --> 03:10.013
I'm... I'm sorry, Eva.

03:10.047 --> 03:11.748
This is really not the kind
of work I like to take on.

03:11.782 --> 03:14.951
Please, Rick, I-I just...
I just want to know

03:14.986 --> 03:16.853
if there's anything left in
my marriage to fight for.

03:17.546 --> 03:20.239
Please. Please.

03:21.070 --> 03:22.651
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah?

03:22.671 --> 03:25.795
Um, I'll just need Cole's
information and a recent photo.

03:27.358 --> 03:28.865
Thank you.

Woman: That's ridiculous. Completely...

03:42.012 --> 03:43.979
Man: No. No, no.
I woke you up this morning.

03:44.014 --> 03:45.581
- Are you even listening? I mean...
- Yeah.

03:45.616 --> 03:47.450
Cole: No, no, no, no.

03:47.484 --> 03:49.785
What I'm talking about
here is knowing about...

03:49.819 --> 03:51.820
knowing what you have
and getting what's right.

03:51.855 --> 03:53.252
Scott: Oh, oh, okay, okay.

03:53.272 --> 03:55.824
But you do realize this
could be a serious payday.

03:55.859 --> 03:57.893
Please, it's chump change, Scott.

03:57.927 --> 03:59.895
Cole... Now, dd-don't be glib, Cole.

03:59.929 --> 04:00.896
It's a legitimate point.

04:00.930 --> 04:02.330
- Scott.
- What?

04:02.365 --> 04:03.966
Do you trust me?

04:04.000 --> 04:05.600
Of course, I trust you.

04:05.981 --> 04:07.198
Robert?

04:07.495 --> 04:08.836
Yes.

04:08.856 --> 04:10.405
[Claps]

04:10.439 --> 04:11.840
Then we're not selling the company,

04:11.875 --> 04:15.177
at least not at this time
and not at that price.

04:15.211 --> 04:16.946
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

04:16.966 --> 04:18.336
Agreed.

04:19.378 --> 04:20.615
Thanks for coming in. Thank you.

04:20.649 --> 04:21.649
[Sighs] All right.

04:21.684 --> 04:24.286
Cole, you, uh,
need a ride back to the office?

04:24.320 --> 04:25.853
No, I have a doctor's appointment.

04:25.888 --> 04:27.855
Okay, I will see you there.

04:27.890 --> 04:28.856
Robert.

04:33.137 --> 04:34.829
[Click]
Hey.

04:34.863 --> 04:35.730
So I've got this pain,

04:35.764 --> 04:39.044
and, uh, I could either go see a doctor,

04:39.064 --> 04:41.550
or I could come see you.

04:42.111 --> 04:44.939
Yeah. Oh, I like the sound of that.

04:44.973 --> 04:47.374
Oh, I'm coming. [Chuckles]

04:47.409 --> 04:49.457
I'll see you soon.

04:56.116 --> 04:58.452
Beckett:
So her husband was having an affair,

04:58.486 --> 04:59.786
and you caught him cheating?

04:59.821 --> 05:01.988
Caught him red-handed and bare-bottomed.

05:02.023 --> 05:03.890
Oh, poor Eva.

05:03.925 --> 05:06.059
- Well how is she taking it?
- Not well, I spent the last half-hour

05:06.094 --> 05:08.128
on the phone with her... lots of crying.

05:08.148 --> 05:10.548
She's packing up now to leave him.
She just wants me to drop

05:10.568 --> 05:12.032
- these pictures by first.
- Wait, tonight?

05:12.066 --> 05:14.701
Yeah, she wants to see firsthand
that her marriage is over.

05:14.736 --> 05:15.736
What am I gonna tell her? No?

05:15.770 --> 05:18.143
Just don't let her cry on
your shoulder too long.

05:18.163 --> 05:20.340
Beckett, remind me never to
take this kind of case again.

05:20.374 --> 05:21.407
Look, you're the one who said

05:21.442 --> 05:22.975
that you're gonna have to
pay your dues as a P.I.

05:23.009 --> 05:25.311
Yeah, that before I knew what it meant.

05:25.346 --> 05:27.690
Would it help at all if I
cooked you dinner tonight?

05:27.963 --> 05:29.249
Immeasurably.

05:29.283 --> 05:30.650
Okay, what time can you make it home?

05:30.684 --> 05:32.151
Uh, Westchester and back?

05:32.185 --> 05:34.153
Factoring in time for shoulder-crying,

05:34.187 --> 05:35.654
8:30, 9:00?

05:35.688 --> 05:36.922
I'll see you then. I love you. [Groans]

05:36.957 --> 05:39.258
It's like you're not even trying.
Would you just pl... hey.

05:39.292 --> 05:40.826
- Hey.
- What's going on with Castle's case?

05:40.861 --> 05:43.929
- Now, don't try to change the subject.
- I'm not talking about this anymore, bro.

05:43.964 --> 05:45.697
What are you not talking about?

05:45.732 --> 05:48.000
Ryan is all up on my back
'cause I'm not dating anyone

05:48.034 --> 05:49.101
- right now.
- Tell her why.

05:49.136 --> 05:50.770
- Okay, so...
- Look, a while ago,

05:50.804 --> 05:54.740
we buy this couples weekend ski trip,
and it's next month.

05:54.774 --> 05:57.066
Oh, except Lanie and Espo
are broken up yet again.

05:57.086 --> 05:58.401
Yeah.

05:59.945 --> 06:00.879
What, you guys have. Come on.

06:00.913 --> 06:02.547
Yeah,
but that's no reason for him and Jenny

06:02.582 --> 06:04.139
to think I can't find anyone else to take.

06:04.159 --> 06:06.599
I mean, come on.
I have no problem getting girls.

06:06.619 --> 06:08.853
But that's the thing.
You don't have to get one.

06:08.888 --> 06:10.621
Jenny and I already have.
We... we have a friend...

06:10.656 --> 06:12.623
Wait, are you talking about a blind date?

06:12.658 --> 06:13.792
Oh, hell no!

06:13.826 --> 06:15.260
Espo, just hear him out.

06:15.294 --> 06:17.461
Her name is Stacy. She's fantastic.

06:17.496 --> 06:20.464
She runs a music store. She's into sports.

06:20.499 --> 06:23.968
And we told her all about you.
She wants to meet.

06:24.003 --> 06:24.935
Hmm. Take a look at her picture.

06:24.969 --> 06:27.004
[Sighs] Come on, man.

06:35.387 --> 06:36.580
She's all right.

06:36.615 --> 06:38.582
She's all right? Espo, she's stunning,

06:38.617 --> 06:41.041
and you won't even meet with her.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.886
Okay, maybe I will.

06:42.921 --> 06:44.454
But only because she's
so excited to meet me,

06:44.488 --> 06:47.110
and you know I don't like
to disappoint the ladies.

06:48.703 --> 06:51.681
Nice. Good job.

- Wait, slow down.

10:25.002 --> 10:28.104
- What's... what's going on?
- Eva was murdered by her husband.

10:28.139 --> 10:30.256
He killed her, and I couldn't...

10:30.674 --> 10:34.032

10:41.446 --> 10:43.697
Castle: Detective Neely,
as I already told you,

10:43.717 --> 10:45.462
I followed Cole Whitfield up here.

10:45.482 --> 10:47.249
He must have knocked me out

10:47.284 --> 10:49.980
because when I came to,
he gone and so was my car.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.954
And why did you go to his
house in the first place?

10:51.988 --> 10:53.722
To give the photos to Eva.

10:53.756 --> 10:54.856
That's when I heard the screaming,

10:54.891 --> 10:58.166
and I saw him dragging her
body through the kitchen.

10:58.186 --> 11:00.896
Before I could do anything,
he drove off with her.

11:00.916 --> 11:04.600
Mr. Castle, it says here
you only got your P.I. license a month ago.

11:04.634 --> 11:06.218
Yes, so?

11:06.238 --> 11:09.737
- So, are you sure about what you saw?
- Of course, I'm sure. I...

11:09.757 --> 11:12.640
Detective, I know Castle.
If he says it happened, it did.

11:12.674 --> 11:14.442
Part of his story checks out.

11:14.477 --> 11:17.812
We found his car parked on an access road
about a hundred yards from here.

11:17.846 --> 11:18.846
Whitfield must have hid

11:18.880 --> 11:20.781
in Castle's car in order
to make his getaway.

11:20.816 --> 11:22.750
Castle: Detective, I am not making this up.

11:22.784 --> 11:24.785
The Whitfield house is a crime scene.

11:24.820 --> 11:27.154
If we go to that kitchen,
we will find blood...

11:27.188 --> 11:28.789
Eva's blood.

Do you have a few minutes to talk?

11:35.230 --> 11:37.264
Yeah, come on in.

11:43.369 --> 11:45.439
So, what is this all about?

11:45.473 --> 11:46.840
What can I do for you folks?

11:46.874 --> 11:50.046
Mr. Whitfield, is your wife, Eva, home?

11:51.374 --> 11:53.550
No. Why?

11:53.570 --> 11:55.119
Do you know where she is?

11:55.355 --> 11:58.618
No, I don't.
I got home about 20 minutes ago.

11:58.653 --> 12:02.288
Found this lovely note from Eva.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.891
She figured out I'm having an affair,
and she left me.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.559
[Scoffs] She left him?

12:06.593 --> 12:08.728
I can't believe this guy.
He forged that note.

12:08.763 --> 12:10.363
I can't even get in touch with her.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.365
I tried calling her. I tried calling her.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.425
The phone just goes straight to voice-mail.

12:14.445 --> 12:16.902
Do you drive a black model "S"?

12:16.936 --> 12:20.673
No, that's... No, that's, uh, Eva's car.

12:21.775 --> 12:24.410
- Has something happened to Eva?
- We're not quite sure,

12:24.444 --> 12:26.745
but you're saying you only
got home 20 minutes ago?

12:26.780 --> 12:29.348
Yeah, right. Uh, around 9:30.

12:29.383 --> 12:32.181
And where were you at 7:45 tonight?

12:34.167 --> 12:36.655
I was, um... I was still in the city.

12:36.690 --> 12:37.923
I was at work.

12:37.957 --> 12:40.392
You know what? I-I think I need a refill.

12:40.412 --> 12:42.087
Excuse me.

12:43.862 --> 12:46.831
He's lying. He's lying about everything.

12:46.865 --> 12:49.734
If you're right, there should be
blood evidence in the kitchen.

12:50.425 --> 12:51.753
It was here.

12:51.773 --> 12:54.573
It happened right here.
He must have cleaned it up.

12:54.607 --> 12:57.175
Why else would he invite us
so freely into his house?

12:57.210 --> 12:59.578
If he did,
he did a hell of a good job of it.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.580
U.V. shows no sign of residue.

13:01.614 --> 13:02.880
Castle...

13:02.915 --> 13:04.882
Kate, I know what I saw. T-there! There!

13:04.917 --> 13:06.666
See? I knew it.

13:06.686 --> 13:09.854
Cole: Knew what? What is going on?

13:09.888 --> 13:11.821
Sir, there's blood residue here.

13:11.841 --> 13:14.584
Mr. Whitfield,
do you know where this came from?

13:16.991 --> 13:18.237
Yes.

13:18.257 --> 13:19.763
My wife is a klutz.

13:19.797 --> 13:22.299
She broke a jar and cut
her hand cleaning it up.

13:22.334 --> 13:24.935
Bled everywhere until
she finally bandaged it.

13:24.969 --> 13:28.467
Why...
why are you looking for blood residue?

13:32.716 --> 13:35.525
Are you suggesting that I
did something to my wife?

13:35.545 --> 13:39.482
No, we're not suggesting, Mr. Whitfield.

13:41.646 --> 13:44.387
Get out.
Get out of my house.

13:44.421 --> 13:46.211
Get out now.

14:01.447 --> 14:02.805
Hey.

14:02.839 --> 14:04.974
How long have you been up?

14:05.199 --> 14:07.410
He probably came home,

14:07.444 --> 14:09.530
saw that Eva was about to leave him,

14:09.550 --> 14:11.847
and killed her in a fit of rage.

14:11.882 --> 14:13.448
I told her everything
was gonna be all right.

14:13.483 --> 14:15.450
I promised her.

14:15.470 --> 14:17.352
I'm sorry, babe.

14:17.571 --> 14:19.454
Have you heard from detective Neely?

14:19.780 --> 14:22.958
She said that search teams
didn't find anything in the woods.

14:22.993 --> 14:24.093
Yeah.

14:24.127 --> 14:26.928
That's because Cole knew he
couldn't leave her out there,

14:26.962 --> 14:29.298
not once I was onto him,
so he put her back in the car

14:29.332 --> 14:31.866
and dumped it and the body someplace else.

14:31.886 --> 14:34.603
Westchester has got a
bolo out on Eva's car,

14:34.637 --> 14:36.204
and they've flagged her credit cards.

14:36.238 --> 14:37.806
Have they pinged her cellphone?

14:37.840 --> 14:40.842
They tried, but it's either off or dead.

14:40.876 --> 14:44.946
Yeah, I want to go with dead.
What about his alibi?

14:44.980 --> 14:46.805
Well, he wasn't at work like he said.

14:46.825 --> 14:50.018
His business partners said
that he left at 6:00 p.m., not at 8:00.

14:50.052 --> 14:52.381
Plenty of time to get back
to Westchester by 7:45.

14:52.401 --> 14:55.645
But when detective Neely confronted
him about it, he revised his story.

14:55.665 --> 14:57.125
He said that he was with his mistress,

14:57.159 --> 15:01.061
Taylor McKinley, that woman
that you took pictures of, until 8:00 p.m.

15:01.095 --> 15:02.996
We need to talk to her.

15:03.031 --> 15:04.832
Castle, I don't have any jurisdiction.

15:04.866 --> 15:06.200
This isn't my case.

15:06.234 --> 15:09.069
Yes, but it's my case. Eva hired me.

15:09.103 --> 15:10.444
She was my friend,

15:10.464 --> 15:12.906
and he killed her right in front of me.

15:14.067 --> 15:15.008
[Sighs]

15:15.043 --> 15:17.144
Okay. I'll talk to the mistress.

15:17.976 --> 15:22.429
But just me, not you.
You're too close to this.

15:27.343 --> 15:30.190
So? We had an affair, and his wife left.

15:30.225 --> 15:32.290
What's the big deal?
That stuff happens every day.

15:32.310 --> 15:35.027
Except wives don't go missing every day.

15:35.062 --> 15:38.064
It's a little soon to say she's missing,
isn't it?

15:38.309 --> 15:40.233
I'm sure she'll be back.

15:40.267 --> 15:43.154
Um, Ms. McKinley,
how long have you known Mr. Whitfield?

15:43.174 --> 15:45.152
Since he started my yoga class a year ago.

15:45.172 --> 15:47.374
And when did the affair begin?

15:47.408 --> 15:49.408
About a week later.

15:50.215 --> 15:51.406
What?

15:51.580 --> 15:54.341
He's hot, and rich.

15:54.775 --> 15:57.684
What time did he come to
your apartment last night?

15:57.704 --> 16:00.186
Like I told the other detective,

16:00.220 --> 16:03.635
he showed up right around 6:00
and he left just after 8:00.

16:03.655 --> 16:07.259
So, the two of you were in
the apartment the whole time?

16:07.569 --> 16:09.327
Yep.

16:11.714 --> 16:14.747
- Ryan: Well, what did you think?
- She was confrontational

16:14.767 --> 16:16.935
and a little too ready with her answers.

16:16.969 --> 16:18.537
You think she's lying?

16:18.571 --> 16:20.038
Go down to her building,

16:20.072 --> 16:22.440
see if anyone else saw Cole
Whitfield there last night.

16:22.474 --> 16:24.042
And let's look into Mr. Whitfield,

16:24.076 --> 16:25.743
find out what else he's hiding from us.

16:25.778 --> 16:27.701
All right. [Elevator bell dings]

16:41.444 --> 16:45.535
What's in the bags, Cole,
and where are you taking them?

17:03.538 --> 17:05.473
- What the hell are you doing?
- I was...

17:05.493 --> 17:08.452
You accuse me of murder,
then you come stalking around my home?

17:08.472 --> 17:09.686
What the hell is your damage, man?

17:09.721 --> 17:11.521
- What? My damage?
- Yeah.

17:11.556 --> 17:12.888
I'm not the one who killed my wife.

17:12.924 --> 17:15.625
You're insane, you know that? Eva's alive.

17:15.660 --> 17:18.028
She just called me 20 minutes ago.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.941
- You're a liar.
- Yeah, I wish.

17:20.961 --> 17:22.433
Because she told me to go screw myself

17:22.467 --> 17:25.289
and that she cleaned out
our joint bank accounts.

17:25.309 --> 17:28.076
Yeah, you don't believe me,
you can check with my bank.

17:28.096 --> 17:29.706
While you guys were searching my house,

17:29.740 --> 17:32.114
the bitch stole $7.4 million from me.

17:32.134 --> 17:33.095
[Siren chirps]

17:33.115 --> 17:35.969
Mr. Whitfield, is there a problem?

17:36.366 --> 17:39.464
Yes. This man is harassing me.

17:39.799 --> 17:42.814
Hey, you'll never prove a thing.

17:44.854 --> 17:45.988
He...

17:46.562 --> 17:49.039
Are you crazy? What were you thinking?

17:49.059 --> 17:51.727
You saw him last night. He's cocky.

17:51.761 --> 17:53.496
And what do all cocky men do?

17:53.530 --> 17:54.663
Make mistakes.

17:54.698 --> 17:56.332
Exactly.

17:56.366 --> 17:58.634
Wait, you're talking about me now,
aren't you?

17:58.668 --> 18:00.669
You're the only witness,
and you are ruining

18:00.704 --> 18:02.738
your credibility when
I'm trying to help you.

18:02.772 --> 18:04.406
What if this gets back to Gates?

18:04.440 --> 18:05.975
I'm just trying to find some proof.

18:06.009 --> 18:08.110
Right now, the proof lies with Cole.

18:08.144 --> 18:10.779
Eva's phone records confirm a
call to him at 9:35 this morning,

18:10.814 --> 18:13.582
and there's also that $7.4 million transfer

18:13.617 --> 18:15.245
to a Swiss bank account last night.

18:15.265 --> 18:17.819
Yes, he's creating reasonable doubt,

18:17.853 --> 18:19.787
building a narrative
that she stole from him,

18:19.822 --> 18:20.888
that she's on the run.

18:20.923 --> 18:23.721
That's why we can't find the body.
That's his plan.

18:23.741 --> 18:25.960
Yo, I just got back from the mistress'
apartment building.

18:25.995 --> 18:27.962
No one remembers seeing
Whitfield at all last night.

18:27.997 --> 18:29.364
Proving he wasn't there.

18:29.398 --> 18:31.333
Proving that no one saw him.

18:31.367 --> 18:32.367
Without a body,

18:32.401 --> 18:34.468
we're gonna need something
more solid than that.

18:34.503 --> 18:35.970
Ryan: Hey, guess what.

18:36.005 --> 18:37.972
Turns out Whitfield was married before,

18:38.007 --> 18:39.173
in Los Angeles.

18:39.207 --> 18:40.241
Mallory Whitfield...

18:40.275 --> 18:42.877
she had an inheritance worth
several million dollars.

18:42.911 --> 18:45.130
- Had?
- Yeah, she died in a hiking accident

18:45.150 --> 18:47.782
in Angeles national forest...
fell into a ravine.

18:47.816 --> 18:50.351
- Guess who the only witness was.
- Her husband, Cole.

18:50.385 --> 18:53.187
Bingo. The cops tried to make a murder case
against him, but he had all the answers.

18:53.221 --> 18:55.156
They could never make
any of the charges stick.

18:55.190 --> 18:58.159
Her entire estate went to Cole,

18:58.193 --> 18:59.693
which he used to start his
business and build his fortune.

18:59.727 --> 19:01.061
So, he got away with it before,

19:01.095 --> 19:02.840
and now he's trying to do it again.

19:02.860 --> 19:06.551
This was no crime of passion.
He planned the whole thing.

19:09.267 --> 19:11.916
So, Cole's first wife dies suspiciously,

19:11.936 --> 19:14.270
and then the second one disappears.

19:14.305 --> 19:15.981
No way that's a coincidence.

19:16.001 --> 19:18.865
This guy's a black widow...
or, rather, black widower.

19:18.885 --> 19:20.410
Only this time, there's no body.

19:20.444 --> 19:22.412
He's trying to create the
illusion that Eva's still alive.

19:22.446 --> 19:25.910
Yeah, and he's going to some major
trouble to make that illusion seem real.

19:26.084 --> 19:29.323
Castle, you said that Cole Whitfield was at
home in Westchester this morning, right?

19:29.343 --> 19:30.420
That's right. He never left.

19:30.454 --> 19:32.288
Well,
I just got the data back from Eva's phone.

19:32.323 --> 19:35.058
The call to Cole pinged
off a tower in Manhattan.

19:35.653 --> 19:38.175
He must have had someone use
Eva's phone to make that call.

19:38.195 --> 19:39.528
He's got an accomplice.

19:39.562 --> 19:42.304
And whoever that is
made that call somewhere near 31st and 4th.

19:42.324 --> 19:44.405
That's where I took those photos.

19:44.425 --> 19:46.142
His mistress, Taylor, lives on that block.

19:46.162 --> 19:48.570
If Taylor lied about his alibi,
she might have made that phone call.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.105
Why don't you guys go and pick her up?

19:50.140 --> 19:52.374
Oh, damn, that means I'm gonna
have to cancel that lunch date

19:52.408 --> 19:54.776
- with Stacy, bro.
- No, no, no, no, no, you can't.

19:54.811 --> 19:56.678
Uh,
you have to make a good first impression.

19:56.713 --> 19:58.547
Oh, for heaven's sake. You know what?

19:58.581 --> 20:01.222
Go enjoy your date.
Ryan and I will go and get her.

20:02.860 --> 20:04.753
I already answered all your questions.

20:04.787 --> 20:06.755
And now we have more

20:06.789 --> 20:08.790
because new information has come to light.

20:08.825 --> 20:11.460
- What new information?
-Before we get to that, I'd like to revisit

20:11.494 --> 20:14.040
something that you said
at our last meeting.

20:14.060 --> 20:18.137
You said that Cole was at your apartment
between 6:00 and 8:00 last night.

20:18.157 --> 20:19.767
Are you still saying that now?

20:19.801 --> 20:21.202
Yep.

20:21.237 --> 20:22.737
None of your neighbors saw him.

20:22.771 --> 20:24.472
Well, he's very discreet.

20:24.506 --> 20:27.865
Did he tell you to say that
he was at your apartment?

20:28.089 --> 20:29.076
No.

20:29.110 --> 20:31.612
Did he ask you to call him
from someone else's cellphone?

20:31.646 --> 20:32.780
[Door opens]

20:32.814 --> 20:34.415
Taylor, don't say another word.

20:34.449 --> 20:35.349
[Door closes]

20:35.384 --> 20:37.818
Aubrey Haskins, attorney for Ms. McKinley.

20:37.853 --> 20:40.053
- Wait, who are you?
- It's okay. Cole sent me.

20:40.088 --> 20:41.914
I'm general counsel for his company.

20:41.934 --> 20:44.091
- Just let me do the talking.
- Taylor, listen to me.

20:44.125 --> 20:46.293
If you provided a false alibi,
that makes you an accomplice.

20:46.327 --> 20:47.594
That means jail.

20:47.628 --> 20:49.296
Accomplice to what, exactly?

20:49.330 --> 20:51.631
- The murder of Eva Whitfield.
- Eva's not dead.

20:51.665 --> 20:53.400
Cole spoke with her this morning.

20:53.434 --> 20:54.902
Or he spoke to someone using her cellphone.

20:54.936 --> 20:56.303
That call pinged off of a tower

20:56.337 --> 20:59.406
right next to your apartment
building at 9:35 a.m.

20:59.440 --> 21:01.747
- Detective, unless you have proof...
- Wait.

21:02.045 --> 21:04.811
Are you accusing me of making that call?

21:04.845 --> 21:07.414
I was at work at 9:35 at the yoga studio.

21:07.448 --> 21:09.482
Taylor, I've got your schedule.
You don't work in the mornings.

21:09.517 --> 21:12.819
No, but I got called in to cover
for another instructor who was sick.

21:12.853 --> 21:14.521
I was there from 9:30 a.m. to 11:00.

21:14.555 --> 21:17.491
- You can check that.
- We're done here, detective.

21:29.807 --> 21:31.359
That was a crafty move.

21:31.379 --> 21:33.672
Cole sent his in-house lawyer
to silence his girlfriend.

21:33.706 --> 21:35.774
He's keeping this thing contained,
in the family.

21:35.809 --> 21:37.609
Yeah, but now that Taylor's lawyered up,

21:37.644 --> 21:38.677
how are we gonna break her?

21:38.711 --> 21:40.312
By digging into her story.

21:40.346 --> 21:42.714
I'll call her work and
check into her alibi.

21:42.749 --> 21:43.515
Hey.

21:43.550 --> 21:45.350
Hey, partner. How did the date go?

21:45.384 --> 21:46.952
Can we talk about it out here?

21:46.986 --> 21:49.555
Oh. What did you think of Stacy?

21:49.589 --> 21:52.390
Oh, man, she was great.

21:52.425 --> 21:54.667
Mm-hmm. Until I started getting
a stalker vibe from her.

21:54.687 --> 21:55.466
What?

21:55.486 --> 21:57.194
Yeah,
we were right in the middle of appetizers,

21:57.228 --> 21:59.229
and that's when she told
me that the blue shorts

21:59.264 --> 22:00.797
I was wearing during the triathlon

22:00.832 --> 22:02.899
made my legs look sexy, which is true,

22:02.934 --> 22:05.836
but how did she even know I competed,

22:05.870 --> 22:08.405
never mind what color shorts I was wearing?

22:08.440 --> 22:10.907
And that's when she told
me that she saw the photo

22:10.942 --> 22:12.342
on my profile.

22:12.376 --> 22:13.643
[Laughs]

22:13.678 --> 22:15.878
Oh, this is funny to you?

22:15.898 --> 22:18.715
You signed me up for match.
Com behind my back?

22:18.749 --> 22:19.649
Well, technically, Jenny did.

22:19.684 --> 22:22.719
I've...
I've only been managing your profile.

22:22.753 --> 22:24.554
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

22:24.589 --> 22:26.089
I almost arrested that girl.

22:26.123 --> 22:28.324
Well,
we were hoping that you'd be so into her

22:28.359 --> 22:29.459
that you'd just let it go.

22:29.493 --> 22:32.549
What the hell is wrong with you?
I can find my own dates.

22:32.569 --> 22:33.863
I know, but you haven't.

22:33.897 --> 22:36.732
And the ski weekend is coming up, so...

22:36.766 --> 22:37.733
Look, look, look, look.

22:37.767 --> 22:39.902
We were just trying to help.

22:40.631 --> 22:42.728
I don't need your help.

22:43.212 --> 22:45.140
This isn't over.

22:49.412 --> 22:50.746
Nah.

22:51.281 --> 22:55.584
The manager at the yoga studio
verified that Taylor was at work from 9:30

22:55.619 --> 22:57.360
- till 11:00 a.m.
- Then the manager's lying.

22:57.380 --> 23:00.055
Castle,
she had a classroom full of 30 people.

23:00.089 --> 23:03.425
She didn't make that call,
but whoever did made sure to do it

23:03.459 --> 23:04.559
right by Taylor's building.

23:04.593 --> 23:07.695
Which means someone wants
us to believe it was Taylor.

23:07.730 --> 23:10.500
And we would have if she
didn't get called into work.

23:11.257 --> 23:13.292
Called into work.

23:14.170 --> 23:15.570
Of course.

23:15.604 --> 23:17.138
Taylor getting called into work

23:17.172 --> 23:19.774
is the one thing the person behind this
couldn't have foreseen.

23:19.808 --> 23:21.809
- That person being Cole.
- No.

23:21.844 --> 23:22.944
- No?
- No.

23:22.978 --> 23:25.980
Beckett, the murder was staged.

23:26.015 --> 23:27.949
This whole thing, i-it's a work of fiction.

23:27.983 --> 23:30.919
I-it's a Hitchcock movie
with me cast as the witness.

23:30.953 --> 23:32.486
I'm Jimmy Stewart in "Vertigo."

23:32.521 --> 23:34.922
The reason we haven't found a body

23:34.956 --> 23:37.189
is because there is no body.

23:37.209 --> 23:38.992
Eva's still alive.

23:39.027 --> 23:41.795
Eva's alive? Castle,
that's not what you believed a moment ago.

23:41.829 --> 23:43.630
It didn't hit me until just now.

23:43.665 --> 23:45.732
Eva is the one person who would want Cole

23:45.767 --> 23:48.302
to look like a murderer and
his mistress an accomplice.

23:48.336 --> 23:51.004
Wait... you saw Cole kill Eva.

23:51.039 --> 23:52.405
I mean, y-you did, didn't you?

23:52.440 --> 23:54.800
I saw what she wanted me to see.

23:55.877 --> 23:58.845
That's why she wanted me to
drop off the photos that night.

23:58.880 --> 24:01.147
Eva's been behind this from the start,

24:01.182 --> 24:03.784
and I'm the gullible P.I. that fell for it.

24:03.818 --> 24:05.786
Why would she go to that length?

24:05.820 --> 24:08.788
Because Eva wanted more than
just out of the marriage.

24:08.822 --> 24:10.957
She wanted Cole to suffer.

24:10.991 --> 24:12.492
She set him up.

24:12.526 --> 24:16.975
He swore that she called him
because she did call him.

24:16.995 --> 24:20.533
She also transferred
the $7.4 million to the swiss bank account.

24:20.568 --> 24:22.502
[Telephone ringing] It's
her walking-away money.

24:22.536 --> 24:24.136
I'm telling you, Beckett,
I am right about this.

24:24.170 --> 24:25.972
Beckett.

24:26.215 --> 24:27.704
When?

24:28.174 --> 24:30.497
Okay. Thanks.

24:32.346 --> 24:34.346
Castle, I'm sorry but...

24:34.380 --> 24:37.016
No, Beckett, I know it sounds crazy,
but Eva is still alive.

24:37.050 --> 24:38.484
No, she's not.

24:38.504 --> 24:40.519
They found her body in the Hudson.

24:40.553 --> 24:41.987
Eva's dead.

24:47.507 --> 24:49.908
There is no way Eva is really dead.

24:49.943 --> 24:52.985
In a classic hitchcockian twist,
it won't be her body.

24:53.005 --> 24:55.381
- Mark my words.
- Then who did we pull out of the river?

24:55.415 --> 24:58.132
- Someone who can pass for Eva.
- Okay, we'll run her prints.

24:58.152 --> 25:00.152
That should clear up
whether it's Eva or not.

25:00.187 --> 25:03.922
Except her prints will be altered,
her face, unrecognizable,

25:03.957 --> 25:06.963
all part of Eva's plan to
commit the perfect crime.

25:07.646 --> 25:08.996
You'll see.

25:15.337 --> 25:18.570
Whoa. She looks just like Eva.

25:18.605 --> 25:20.438
That's because it is Eva.

25:20.473 --> 25:22.640
Her prints match. This is your girl.

25:22.990 --> 25:24.675
No, it can't be.

25:24.710 --> 25:27.479
I checked her dental records, too, Castle.
It's her.

25:27.513 --> 25:29.680
I wish I could tell you it wasn't.

25:29.715 --> 25:33.084
I take it that the cause of death
is blunt-force trauma.

25:33.119 --> 25:35.019
It looks like a massive skull fracture

25:35.053 --> 25:37.254
in the parietal region,
but she just came in,

25:37.288 --> 25:39.247
so I've only done a preliminary exam.

25:39.267 --> 25:41.358
Once I've finished my autopsy,
I'll give you a call.

25:41.392 --> 25:42.965
Okay.

25:48.710 --> 25:50.668
Castle, I'm sorry about your friend.

25:51.343 --> 25:53.391
Yeah, me too.

25:53.763 --> 25:56.507
Now that we have a body,
maybe that will give us some leverage.

25:57.970 --> 25:59.109
[Elevator bell dings]

26:00.179 --> 26:02.779
Taylor, we need to talk.

26:02.813 --> 26:04.290
My lawyer said not to speak with you.

26:04.310 --> 26:06.450
Fine. Then just listen.

26:06.484 --> 26:08.652
I don't know what Cole told you,
but his wife is dead.

26:08.686 --> 26:11.953
Her body was found less than two hours ago.

26:12.723 --> 26:13.957
Oh, my God.

26:13.991 --> 26:15.558
Listen, Taylor,

26:15.592 --> 26:17.027
if you want to stay out of prison,

26:17.061 --> 26:19.386
now's the time to tell us the truth.

26:25.503 --> 26:27.870
Beckett: Ms. Haskins, welcome back.

26:27.904 --> 26:32.408
You seem to be representing
everyone in this matter.

26:32.442 --> 26:34.310
Before we begin,

26:34.344 --> 26:36.312
Mr. Whitfield is here only because you said

26:36.346 --> 26:38.581
you have information on
his wife's whereabouts.

26:38.615 --> 26:40.916
Cole, you said that you
spoke with Eva this morning.

26:40.950 --> 26:42.579
What did she say?

26:42.599 --> 26:45.173
She said it was over and
that she was leaving town.

26:45.193 --> 26:48.223
Detective,
did you find Mrs. Whitfield or not?

26:48.257 --> 26:52.030
Oh, we found her... In the Hudson...

26:52.390 --> 26:54.663
Murdered by you.

26:54.698 --> 26:55.698
That's a lie.

26:55.732 --> 26:57.432
Taylor gave you up.

26:57.466 --> 26:59.601
She said that you weren't
with her last night.

26:59.635 --> 27:01.869
You spoke to my client without me?

27:01.904 --> 27:02.970
She waived her right.

27:03.005 --> 27:05.773
Mr. Whitfield,
if you weren't with Taylor last night,

27:05.808 --> 27:07.742
- then where were you?
- Don't answer that.

27:07.776 --> 27:09.877
Are you pressing charges?

27:11.278 --> 27:13.032
Inevitably, yeah.

27:13.052 --> 27:14.683
Cole, let's go.

27:23.791 --> 27:24.726
Hey.

27:25.121 --> 27:26.151
Hey!

27:26.171 --> 27:27.616
I know you did it.

27:27.636 --> 27:29.563
- Do not speak to my client.
- You killed her.

27:29.598 --> 27:31.599
- I saw you.
- Castle, Castle, hey.

27:31.633 --> 27:33.734
Detective,
what the hell kind of precinct is this?

27:33.768 --> 27:35.173
Just take your client and go home.

27:35.193 --> 27:38.675
- We'll be coming back for you soon enough.
- Let's go.

27:41.629 --> 27:44.745
- Castle, what was that?
- I know. I know. I'm sorry.

27:44.779 --> 27:47.781
Castle, you're stressed.
Go home and try to relax.

27:47.815 --> 27:49.049
I'll be fine.

27:49.083 --> 27:51.417
I know you will.
But right now, you just need to walk away.

27:53.107 --> 27:54.235
Yeah.

27:54.255 --> 27:55.789
Yeah, you're right.

27:55.823 --> 27:56.957
Okay.

27:56.991 --> 27:58.658
[Cellphone rings]

27:59.845 --> 28:00.627
[Beep]

28:00.661 --> 28:02.229
Lanie, what do you got?

28:02.263 --> 28:03.830
During the autopsy, I discovered

28:03.865 --> 28:05.996
that Eva's fingernail on her left index

28:06.016 --> 28:08.635
had been split down the middle.

28:08.669 --> 28:13.405
Wedged in that crack
were these three hairs.

28:14.559 --> 28:17.142
These hairs must have gotten
transferred during the struggle.

28:17.176 --> 28:18.423
Most likely.

28:18.443 --> 28:20.322
Lanie, how fast can you test these?

28:20.342 --> 28:21.846
Cole's DNA is still on file

28:21.881 --> 28:24.449
from when he was suspected
of murdering his first wife.

28:24.484 --> 28:26.752
I already ran them, and they're a match.

28:26.786 --> 28:29.487
Cole Whitfield is your man.

28:29.521 --> 28:30.789
[Knock on door]

28:30.823 --> 28:33.792
Kemp: Mr. Whitfield!

28:35.084 --> 28:38.646
Mr. Whitfield,
we have a warrant for your arrest.

28:42.894 --> 28:44.702
No answer, not a the front or the back.

28:44.736 --> 28:46.704
His S.U.V.'s in the driveway.

28:46.738 --> 28:49.774
- Should we take the door?
- There's no need.

28:51.510 --> 28:53.844
Mr. Whitfield? [Gun cocks]

28:53.878 --> 28:55.279
Show yourself.

28:55.314 --> 28:58.282
Let's not make this
harder than it has to be.

29:30.952 --> 29:33.152
Are you doing okay?

29:33.388 --> 29:35.523
I just never thought the
story would end like this.

29:35.557 --> 29:37.024
Yeah, I bet Cole didn't either.

29:37.058 --> 29:40.516
Yeah, but suicide? What did the M.E. say?

29:40.536 --> 29:42.529
That it looks like he wrapped
the cord around his neck

29:42.564 --> 29:44.665
and stepped off the balcony.

29:44.699 --> 29:46.700
Look, I'm sorry.

29:46.734 --> 29:49.825
I know that this isn't
how you wanted it to end.

29:57.578 --> 29:59.266
Beckett?

30:00.693 --> 30:02.582
Beckett, are you still awake?

30:02.877 --> 30:04.184
No.

30:04.218 --> 30:05.985
Good. Something's bothering me.

30:06.019 --> 30:08.654
Yeah? Something's bothering me, too.

30:08.689 --> 30:11.078
Why would a guy like Cole commit suicide?

30:11.098 --> 30:14.064
Because a guy like Cole
didn't think he could face going to prison.

30:14.084 --> 30:15.761
As wealthy and connected as he was?

30:15.796 --> 30:17.697
W-would he have even gone to prison?

30:17.731 --> 30:20.122
The case against him was circumstantial.

30:20.142 --> 30:21.701
He could have beaten it in court.

30:21.735 --> 30:23.907
Well, evidently, he didn't think so.

30:24.763 --> 30:26.071
It's too clean.

30:26.106 --> 30:29.208
Castle, stop chasing the mice in your head.

30:29.242 --> 30:31.457
But what if they're
leading me to the truth?

30:31.477 --> 30:34.684
Then we'll deal with it in the morning.

31:04.839 --> 31:06.076
Castle?

31:06.111 --> 31:09.431
Hey,
I brought you some coffee on my way to...

31:09.728 --> 31:11.218
Wow.

31:11.478 --> 31:14.944
You definitely don't need any more coffee.

31:14.964 --> 31:16.486
[Chuckling] What is this?

31:16.521 --> 31:17.868
Uh, timeline.

31:17.888 --> 31:22.323
Eva is red, Cole is green,
and Taylor is blue.

31:22.343 --> 31:24.594
A timeline for a case that's closed?

31:24.629 --> 31:26.894
Not yet. Cole didn't kill himself.

31:26.914 --> 31:28.265
Based on what?

31:28.299 --> 31:30.000
Based on his personality.

31:30.035 --> 31:32.302
Cole is cocky. He's entitled.

31:32.336 --> 31:34.604
He's far too much of a
narcissist to commit suicide.

31:34.639 --> 31:37.641
So if he didn't kill himself,
that means he was murdered.

31:37.675 --> 31:39.842
Castle, that's a pretty big "if."

31:39.877 --> 31:41.278
It changes everything.

31:41.312 --> 31:44.481
Because if Cole didn't kill himself,
it follows that he didn't murder Eva.

31:44.515 --> 31:45.482
Someone else did.

31:45.516 --> 31:47.651
That's why he was staged
to look like a suicide,

31:47.685 --> 31:50.252
so the police would conclude
that he was the guilty party.

31:50.287 --> 31:53.022
Then whoever killed Cole also killed Eva.

31:53.057 --> 31:54.256
And who would that be?

31:54.291 --> 31:57.274
The man I saw "attacking" her.
Whoever hit me in the woods.

31:57.294 --> 31:59.334
Who you said was Cole.

31:59.354 --> 32:01.597
He wanted me to believe he was Cole.

32:01.631 --> 32:03.305
It was just all theater.

32:03.325 --> 32:05.000
Okay, Castle, let's say for a second,

32:05.034 --> 32:07.276
that someone snuck into the
house disguised as Cole,

32:07.296 --> 32:10.138
and attacked Eva.
How could they possibly know

32:10.173 --> 32:11.940
that you were gonna be there to witness it?

32:11.974 --> 32:14.009
Well,
he had to have been in on it with Eva.

32:14.043 --> 32:17.408
If Eva is a part of the setup,
then why is she in the morgue?

32:17.428 --> 32:20.486
Because, in classic Hitchcock fashion,

32:20.506 --> 32:22.818
her co-conspirator double-crossed her.

32:22.852 --> 32:25.821
"The articles of incorporation
for Whitfield & Galloway."

32:25.855 --> 32:27.055
Cole's company?

32:27.090 --> 32:28.489
It took me two boxes of cronuts

32:28.524 --> 32:30.658
to get that out of the
county clerk's office.

32:30.693 --> 32:32.994
See, Cole and his partner Scott Galloway

32:33.029 --> 32:34.796
were in business together,
but in that document,

32:34.831 --> 32:36.464
it says if anything happens

32:36.498 --> 32:38.566
to one of them,
the other one gains control of the company.

32:38.601 --> 32:42.237
You're suggesting that Scott Galloway
was Eva's co-conspirator.

32:42.271 --> 32:44.572
I listened to the recording
I made of their lunch.

32:44.607 --> 32:46.207
This could be a serious payday.

32:46.242 --> 32:48.008
Please, it's chump change, Scott.

32:48.043 --> 32:50.044
Now, d-d-don't be glib, Cole.

32:50.078 --> 32:52.046
They were getting a major
offer to buyout their firm,

32:52.080 --> 32:55.597
an offer that Cole was against,
so I did a credit check on Scott Galloway.

32:55.617 --> 32:57.852
He was in massive debt.

32:57.886 --> 32:59.653
A buyout would have fixed all that.

32:59.687 --> 33:01.255
But in order for that to happen,

33:01.289 --> 33:03.557
he needed control of the company.

33:03.591 --> 33:06.560
Eva wanted out of her marriage,
and she wanted Cole punished.

33:06.594 --> 33:09.730
So they teamed up to take
Cole out of the picture.

33:09.765 --> 33:11.898
Castle,
there's no evidence that supports this.

33:11.932 --> 33:15.472
It was Scott Galloway. It has to be.

33:15.492 --> 33:18.572
Beckett,
will you please just check Scott's alibi?

33:18.606 --> 33:20.227
Would you do that for me?

33:20.247 --> 33:23.801
I will. But listen to me.
Eva was your friend.

33:23.821 --> 33:25.879
She came here to this very
office and asked for your help,

33:25.913 --> 33:27.947
and now she's dead,
and you feel responsible,

33:27.982 --> 33:29.986
and that can make you see ghosts.

33:31.786 --> 33:34.720
Wait, we're looking into
Scott Galloway now? Why?

33:34.755 --> 33:37.023
I thought everything pointed to
Cole Whitfield being the killer.

33:37.057 --> 33:38.028
It does.

33:38.048 --> 33:40.726
Oh, you believe this theory of Castle's?

33:40.746 --> 33:43.196
I believe that he's been
right too many times

33:43.230 --> 33:45.213
not to consider it.

33:56.854 --> 33:59.088
[Dialing]

34:00.146 --> 34:01.546
[Cellphone rings]

34:01.580 --> 34:04.290
[Beep] Hey, I was just about to call you.

34:04.310 --> 34:06.251
Castle: Listen,
I've been thinking about it,

34:06.286 --> 34:08.695
and with the benefit of hindsight,
y-you're right.

34:08.715 --> 34:11.656
I can see how I might have
tumbled down the rabbit hole.

34:11.690 --> 34:13.406
Scott Galloway probably has
nothing to do with this.

34:13.426 --> 34:14.893
No, he doesn't.

34:14.928 --> 34:17.228
His alibi checks out,
but you were right, Castle.

34:17.262 --> 34:19.464
We found proof that Cole didn't kill Eva.

34:19.797 --> 34:23.335
And I know who did.

34:23.920 --> 34:26.138
Scott Galloway is in the clear.

34:26.940 --> 34:30.038
At 7:45, when Eva was supposedly attacked,

34:30.058 --> 34:32.118
he was at his son's basketball game.

34:32.138 --> 34:34.494
But you said you had proof
that Cole didn't kill Eva.

34:34.527 --> 34:36.407
- What is it?
- Your theory about Scott didn't pan out,

34:36.427 --> 34:38.991
but we did due diligence
and looked at other people in Cole's life,

34:39.011 --> 34:41.858
and that's when we found this.

34:42.454 --> 34:43.436
Is that Cole's S.U.V.?

34:43.469 --> 34:46.551
It is. Street cams show
that Cole was in this house,

34:46.571 --> 34:48.904
which is in scarsdale,
from 6:00 and 8:00 p.M.

34:48.924 --> 34:50.976
Therefore,
Cole Whitfield could not have been the man

34:51.012 --> 34:52.359
that you saw attack Eva.

34:52.379 --> 34:54.214
Esposito: And here's another fun fact.

34:54.248 --> 34:55.581
Cole visited that house on a regular basis

34:55.616 --> 34:57.652
between 6:00 and 8:00 p.M.

34:57.672 --> 34:58.584
Whose house is that?

34:58.619 --> 35:00.208
Robert James,

35:00.228 --> 35:03.589
one of the other executives
at Whitfield & Galloway.

35:03.624 --> 35:06.092
He was at the lunch, but what was
Cole doing at Robert James' house?

35:06.127 --> 35:07.627
Oh, he wasn't there to see Robert James.

35:07.661 --> 35:09.229
Turns out,
he always worked late at the office,

35:09.263 --> 35:11.435
but Mrs. James was there.

35:12.725 --> 35:14.165
Are you kidding?

35:14.185 --> 35:17.099
Cole was having a second affair
with his colleague's wife?

35:17.119 --> 35:19.806
Which is probably why he lied
about where he was that night.

35:19.840 --> 35:22.700
Esposito: The wife confirmed the affair,
but she thought that nobody knew about it.

35:22.720 --> 35:26.518
Can we put Robert James near
the Whitfield house that night?

35:26.980 --> 35:29.081
Damn right we can.

35:29.766 --> 35:31.283
[Door opens]

35:31.318 --> 35:33.852
Mr. James, uh,
thank you so much for coming in.

35:33.886 --> 35:36.288
Of course, though I'm not
quite sure how I can help you.

35:36.323 --> 35:38.290
Well,
you can start by telling me where you were

35:38.325 --> 35:39.839
two nights ago at 8:00 p.M.

35:39.859 --> 35:41.760
Well, I work late. I was at the office.

35:41.794 --> 35:43.662
No, you weren't.

35:43.696 --> 35:48.834
In fact,
this is you at a tollbooth at 7:04 p.M.

35:48.868 --> 35:52.042
Heading to Cole's house in Westchester.

35:52.749 --> 35:56.174
There is no need for lying here.

35:57.080 --> 35:59.677
When Eva found out that Cole
was sleeping with your wife,

35:59.697 --> 36:02.842
she came to you with a plan.

36:03.921 --> 36:04.715
Yes.

36:04.749 --> 36:06.517
He had betrayed the both of you.

36:06.551 --> 36:08.612
You wanted revenge.

36:08.848 --> 36:10.021
[Scoffs]

36:10.055 --> 36:12.619
The man looked me in the eye every day,

36:12.639 --> 36:15.626
and then he went to my home, to my wife.

36:16.002 --> 36:18.161
He deserved what he got.

36:18.997 --> 36:23.166
So,
you staged the attack on Eva in her house?

36:23.201 --> 36:26.403
Yes, so that P.I. would see it

36:26.437 --> 36:28.806
and the trail would lead straight to Cole.

36:28.840 --> 36:30.307
It was all for show, of course.

36:30.341 --> 36:31.876
Cole gets arrested,

36:31.910 --> 36:34.244
Eva gets his money and disappears.

36:34.521 --> 36:36.079
So, how did Eva end up dead?

36:36.114 --> 36:37.214
I-I don't know.

36:37.248 --> 36:39.349
I-I spoke to her the next morning.

36:39.384 --> 36:41.818
Eva was stressed-out, regretful.

36:41.852 --> 36:44.247
Said the plan was never her
idea in the first place.

36:44.267 --> 36:46.390
- Whose plan was it?
- I don't know.

36:46.424 --> 36:48.591
But... but she was having second thoughts

36:48.626 --> 36:51.093
about seeing Cole convicted for her murder.

36:51.128 --> 36:52.996
And she was thinking about coming forward.

36:53.030 --> 36:55.398
And that would have ruined you,
which is why you killed her?

36:55.432 --> 36:57.366
No, no, no, no. All I did was help Eva.

36:57.401 --> 36:59.201
I-I had nothing to do with her murder.

36:59.236 --> 37:00.202
Yeah, Mr. James,

37:00.237 --> 37:04.073
when was the last time
that you actually saw Eva?

37:04.107 --> 37:06.442
After we got back from the woods,

37:06.476 --> 37:10.279
we cleaned up her house,
and then I gave her a key

37:10.313 --> 37:12.168
to one of the company's
corporate apartments,

37:12.188 --> 37:14.016
and I left.

37:14.051 --> 37:15.418
Corporate apartment?

37:15.452 --> 37:17.386
She needed a place to stay

37:17.421 --> 37:19.688
until she could get out of the country.

37:19.820 --> 37:22.223
So,
Robert James was nowhere near Westchester

37:22.258 --> 37:24.259
at the time of Cole's death.

37:24.293 --> 37:26.227
That pretty much rules
him out for both murders.

37:26.262 --> 37:27.395
Could also mean he was telling the truth,

37:27.430 --> 37:30.191
that it was someone other than
Eva that planned the set up.

37:30.211 --> 37:32.367
And I think I know who that is.

37:32.401 --> 37:33.635
CSU checked on that corporate apartment.

37:33.670 --> 37:37.562
They found Eva's fingerprints,
but that's not all they found.

37:47.124 --> 37:49.484
I'm just putting Cole's affairs in order.

37:49.518 --> 37:50.918
I'm busy. Do you need something?

37:50.953 --> 37:51.986
Ms. Haskins,

37:52.020 --> 37:54.055
you should know that Cole
Whitfield's blood work

37:54.090 --> 37:56.935
came in, showing high levels of sedatives.

37:56.955 --> 37:59.927
So high, in fact,
he wouldn't have been able to hang himself.

37:59.962 --> 38:02.179
We re-checked his phone records

38:02.199 --> 38:05.132
and noticed that you called his
house on numerous occasions.

38:05.166 --> 38:07.762
Of course I did.
I'm general counsel for Cole's company.

38:07.782 --> 38:11.438
Yeah, but most of these phone calls came in
after Cole was already at work.

38:11.473 --> 38:13.503
Eva consulted with me, as well.

38:13.523 --> 38:16.443
That's how you found out her
marriage was falling apart

38:16.478 --> 38:18.445
and about her prenup.

38:18.480 --> 38:20.080
So you whispered in her ear,

38:20.115 --> 38:22.951
told her how she could punish Cole

38:22.971 --> 38:25.351
and make a little walking-away
money in the process.

38:25.371 --> 38:28.922
Really? And why would I do that?

38:28.956 --> 38:31.324
You know, we were surprised to learn

38:31.358 --> 38:33.259
that Cole's first wife, Mallory,

38:33.293 --> 38:36.540
was a sorority sister of yours in college,

38:36.560 --> 38:38.965
and you were devastated by her death.

38:39.841 --> 38:40.871
We all were.

38:40.891 --> 38:42.936
Yeah,
but you were the one that told friends

38:42.970 --> 38:44.470
that he got away with murder.

38:44.505 --> 38:47.273
So, why, after all of these years,

38:47.307 --> 38:50.987
would you leave a top-level law firm
to join Cole's company?

38:52.613 --> 38:54.219
Here's a theory.

38:54.239 --> 38:57.350
You took the job
to insinuate yourself into Cole's life,

38:57.384 --> 38:59.137
searching for the right way,

38:59.157 --> 39:01.854
the right moment to get
revenge for Mallory,

39:01.888 --> 39:04.275
and you found it with Eva.

39:04.945 --> 39:06.391
That's absurd.

39:06.425 --> 39:07.726
Is it? Eva called your cellphone

39:07.761 --> 39:10.056
from the the corporate-apartment landline

39:10.076 --> 39:12.397
after she was already supposedly dead.

39:12.431 --> 39:14.232
Eva got cold feet.

39:14.267 --> 39:16.468
She wanted to come forward,
but you couldn't have that,

39:16.502 --> 39:18.570
not after all those years,
after all that planning.

39:18.604 --> 39:20.738
So you decided Eva's fake murder

39:20.773 --> 39:22.829
would have to become a real one.

39:22.849 --> 39:26.105
And killing Cole was just a
way of tying up loose ends.

39:27.346 --> 39:29.080
Wow.

39:29.114 --> 39:31.216
That's an exciting story, Mr. Castle.

39:31.250 --> 39:33.553
Maybe it will make a great book,

39:33.573 --> 39:35.241
but it doesn't make for much of a case.

39:35.261 --> 39:36.457
We got a warrant.

39:36.477 --> 39:40.031
We found Eva's blood and DNA
in the trunk of your car.

39:41.383 --> 39:43.629
It's over, Ms. Haskins.

39:47.153 --> 39:48.816
I doubt it.

39:53.175 --> 39:54.405
Well, we'll take it from here.

39:54.439 --> 39:56.774
Again, thanks for everything.

You're probably right.
I should sleep on it.
