01:23.234 --> 01:25.934
Hey, guys, get your money out,
I'm going to make you rich.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.133
What's up, Tony?

01:27.200 --> 01:29.267
I got a tip on a fight
on the island.

01:29.334 --> 01:30.601
We can't lose.
You know how I know?

01:30.667 --> 01:32.267
He's fighting you?

01:32.334 --> 01:33.968
Better than that.

01:34.033 --> 01:35.334
Nothing's better than that.

01:35.400 --> 01:37.167
Thank you.

01:37.234 --> 01:39.067
I heard these two guys talking
in the gym

01:39.133 --> 01:40.968
about this light heavyweight
named Johnson, right?
Yeah? Yeah?

01:41.033 --> 01:42.501
He's got a broken right hand,

01:42.567 --> 01:44.067
but he's going to fight anyway
'cause he needs the money.

01:44.133 --> 01:45.801
Ooh, that sounds
good to me.
I'm in.

01:45.868 --> 01:47.167
Me, too.
I'm in. I'm in.

01:47.234 --> 01:48.834
Hey, Latka, do you
want to get in on this bet?

01:48.901 --> 01:49.834
A bet?
Yeah.

01:49.901 --> 01:51.167
Okay.

01:51.234 --> 01:52.467
Oh, come on, guys.

01:52.534 --> 01:53.467
What?

01:53.534 --> 01:54.634
ALEX:
Yeah, What?

01:54.701 --> 01:56.400
Do you have to get
Latka involved in this?

01:56.467 --> 01:58.400
Elaine, listen,
we know you get
a little irrational

01:58.467 --> 01:59.634
when it come to
gambling, so...

01:59.701 --> 02:01.033
No, it's not that.

02:01.100 --> 02:02.968
It's just that, you know,
Latka doesn't make much money

02:03.033 --> 02:04.300
and he has
to work so hard,

02:04.367 --> 02:06.267
and he's sending money
to people back home. Besides,

02:06.334 --> 02:08.601
I bet he doesn't even know
what he's betting on.

02:08.667 --> 02:09.734
TONY:
Sure he does.

02:09.800 --> 02:11.000
That's right.

02:11.067 --> 02:12.501
Okay, what are you betting on?

02:12.567 --> 02:14.300
Uh...

02:14.367 --> 02:16.100
the horse racing.

02:16.167 --> 02:17.734
No.

02:17.801 --> 02:19.133
Uh... football.

02:19.200 --> 02:20.567
Nope.

02:20.634 --> 02:21.968
Badminton?

02:23.133 --> 02:24.400
Latka...

02:24.467 --> 02:26.801
Chin-punching.

02:27.567 --> 02:28.734
Latka,
it's boxing,

02:28.801 --> 02:30.434
and it's
a sure thing.

02:30.501 --> 02:31.534
There's no sure thing.

02:31.601 --> 02:32.667
Hey, listen, Latka,
it's your money

02:32.734 --> 02:33.801
and you can do
what you want.

02:33.868 --> 02:34.901
That's right, Latka.

02:34.968 --> 02:36.300
What would
you do, Alex?

02:36.367 --> 02:38.701
Me?
Yeah.

02:38.767 --> 02:40.167
What do you mean,
if I was you?
Yeah.

02:40.234 --> 02:42.367
I would tell Elaine, uh...

02:42.434 --> 02:45.801
( <i>in Latka's voice</i> ):
Elaine, Elaine...

02:45.868 --> 02:48.234
this fellow has
a broken hand,

02:48.300 --> 02:49.968
and I could win many dollars,

02:50.033 --> 02:52.434
and that would make
my family and me very happy.

02:52.501 --> 02:53.767
Thank you very much.

03:00.167 --> 03:01.334
You may laugh,

03:01.400 --> 03:03.667
but I know people
who talk like that.

03:08.467 --> 03:10.200
I'm in.

03:10.267 --> 03:11.467
There we go.
All right.

03:11.534 --> 03:12.567
Listen, I'll call the bet in,
all right?

03:12.634 --> 03:13.767
Thanks
a lot, Alex.

03:13.834 --> 03:15.901
Hey, come on...

03:15.968 --> 03:18.267
Are you going
to bet, too, boss?

03:18.334 --> 03:21.133
I have one very firm
rule in my life:

03:21.200 --> 03:23.334
I don't eat at
the same table,

03:23.400 --> 03:24.934
bet on the same side,

03:25.000 --> 03:28.067
or climb on the same
airplane as losers.

03:28.133 --> 03:29.334
Be gone, Iggy.

03:29.400 --> 03:31.467
Okey-doke.

03:32.467 --> 03:33.734
ALEX:
Hey, Tony,

03:33.801 --> 03:35.334
thanks a lot for
letting us in on that tip.

03:35.400 --> 03:36.634
Hey, don't mention it, Alex.

03:36.701 --> 03:38.033
Oh, it's a sweet one.

03:38.100 --> 03:40.601
Hey, Tony? Tony, the guy's name
is Johnson, right?

03:40.667 --> 03:42.400
That's right,
that's our man

03:42.467 --> 03:43.968
and he's going down.

03:44.033 --> 03:47.100
Yeah, well, the guy Johnson's
fighting is named Johnson, too.

03:47.167 --> 03:48.934
Wow.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.167
What a coincidence.

03:50.234 --> 03:52.033
I wonder how many Johnsons
there could be?

03:52.100 --> 03:55.634
At least two, and they're
fighting each other tonight.

03:55.701 --> 03:57.934
What do we do, Tone?

03:58.000 --> 03:59.200
Oh, geez...

03:59.267 --> 04:01.167
Just bet on one of them.

04:01.234 --> 04:04.133
We got a 50-50 chance
on a sure thing.

04:04.200 --> 04:06.634
Listen, you just have
a nice day, okay?

04:06.701 --> 04:08.200
Yeah, thanks a lot.

04:08.267 --> 04:12.501
You must all promise to keep me
informed of your flight plans.

04:12.567 --> 04:15.133
ALEX:
Elaine...

04:15.200 --> 04:17.033
if you value our friendship,

04:17.100 --> 04:18.466
you will not put that smirk
into words.

04:18.534 --> 04:19.934
Oh, I'm sorry, guys.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.834
I don't mean to make
you feel any worse than you do.

04:22.901 --> 04:25.834
It's just that I see
you guys miss every day.

04:25.901 --> 04:28.968
Every day you come in here
with some sure thing

04:29.033 --> 04:30.567
and it never works out.

04:30.634 --> 04:32.400
And every day at that gallery

04:32.467 --> 04:34.467
I see rich people
getting richer.

04:34.534 --> 04:37.367
I mean, they are always
gambling, and it never misses.

04:37.434 --> 04:40.067
Just once, I'd like
to see somebody like us

04:40.133 --> 04:41.267
make some money.

04:41.334 --> 04:42.400
Oh, me, too.

04:42.467 --> 04:44.267
But how?

04:44.334 --> 04:46.601
By making intelligent
investments,

04:46.667 --> 04:47.767
you know, like in art
for example.

04:47.834 --> 04:49.033
Art?

04:49.100 --> 04:51.133
You bet on painters?

04:51.200 --> 04:54.367
Yeah, in a way.

04:54.434 --> 04:56.033
See, I find paintings

04:56.100 --> 04:57.701
that I know are going
to go up in value

04:57.767 --> 04:59.801
and then I get other
people to invest in them

04:59.868 --> 05:00.934
and then they become rich.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.300
Hey, wait a
minute, Elaine.

05:02.367 --> 05:04.200
If you could do it
for other people,

05:04.267 --> 05:05.434
you could do it for us.

05:05.501 --> 05:06.934
You could do it
for yourself.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.167
Oh, no,
I don't think so.

05:08.234 --> 05:09.601
Come on, Elaine, Elaine,
We can pool our money

05:09.667 --> 05:11.033
and you can
invest it

05:11.100 --> 05:12.367
in some art
for us.

05:12.434 --> 05:14.767
I'm in, and there'll be
more tomorrow

05:14.834 --> 05:16.534
when I get my fight money.

05:16.601 --> 05:18.033
Oh, please.

05:18.100 --> 05:19.934
No, guys, I don't like
to look at art that way.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.801
See, I was just using
art as an example.

05:22.868 --> 05:26.267
Oh, no, but, Elaine, you
have inside information.

05:26.334 --> 05:29.200
I know I've got
inside information, but, um,

05:29.267 --> 05:32.701
I love art, and I hate using it
to make money.

05:32.767 --> 05:34.868
Besides, how much
could we raise?

05:34.934 --> 05:36.234
As much as we need.

05:36.300 --> 05:37.801
Come on, come on,
let's do it.

05:37.868 --> 05:40.067
Yeah, Yeah, come on,
what do you say, huh?

05:40.133 --> 05:42.567
No, No, No. I promised myself
I'd never do it. No.

05:42.634 --> 05:44.501
This could be
the best thing

05:44.567 --> 05:46.467
that's ever
happened for us.

05:46.534 --> 05:48.167
No, guys, I mean,
this is final.

05:48.234 --> 05:49.701
That's it, forget it.

05:49.767 --> 05:51.901
Boy.

05:54.200 --> 05:57.968
I don't think you ever had
any inside information.

05:58.033 --> 06:01.200
I think you were just
trying to impress us.

06:01.267 --> 06:02.467
As a matter of fact,

06:02.534 --> 06:04.033
I know of a great
investment right now.

06:04.100 --> 06:06.200
You do?

06:06.267 --> 06:08.367
Yes. There's an artist
named Max Duffin,

06:08.434 --> 06:10.167
and he's going to
be so big. I mean,

06:10.234 --> 06:12.234
next week at an auction
we could get a painting
for $2,000,

06:12.300 --> 06:13.801
and by the end
of the year

06:13.868 --> 06:15.334
it'd be worth $5,000.

06:15.400 --> 06:16.868
$5,000?

06:16.934 --> 06:19.000
We could make a fortune if we
kept doing that.

06:19.067 --> 06:21.234
Yeah, well, maybe
not a fortune

06:21.300 --> 06:22.701
but $100,000 apiece.

06:22.767 --> 06:25.434
100... well, it would
still be worth it.

06:25.501 --> 06:27.901
Listen, Elaine, please,
come on, okay? Come on.

06:27.968 --> 06:30.534
Yeah, come on, Elaine,
don't deny us a Duffin.

06:30.601 --> 06:32.234
No.

06:32.300 --> 06:35.601
Elaine, Elaine, don't
let this chance slip by.

06:35.667 --> 06:37.033
Do you remember "If"?

06:37.100 --> 06:38.234
"If"?

06:38.300 --> 06:39.634
Yeah, "If"
by Rudyard Kipling.

06:39.701 --> 06:43.100
"If you could make one heap
of all your winnings

06:43.167 --> 06:46.934
"and risk it on one turn
of pitch-and-toss, and lose

06:47.000 --> 06:48.734
"and start again
at your beginnings

06:48.801 --> 06:50.033
"and never
breathe a word

06:50.100 --> 06:51.067
about your loss..."

06:51.133 --> 06:53.200
"If you can talk
with crowds

06:53.267 --> 06:55.234
"and keep
your virtue

06:55.300 --> 06:59.167
"or walk with kings--
nor lose the common touch.

06:59.234 --> 07:03.033
"If neither foes nor loving
friends can hurt you.

07:03.100 --> 07:06.133
"If all men count with
you, but none too much.

07:06.200 --> 07:08.767
"If you can fill
the unforgiving minute

07:08.834 --> 07:11.567
"with sixty seconds' worth
of minutes run

07:11.634 --> 07:13.601
"then yours
is the earth

07:13.667 --> 07:15.968
"and everything that's in it

07:16.033 --> 07:20.133
and, which is more,
you will be a man, my son!"

07:26.267 --> 07:28.801
Where the hell did I learn that?

07:30.467 --> 07:32.634
Okay, you got me.

07:32.701 --> 07:33.834
We did?

07:33.901 --> 07:35.200
Yeah, we'll do it.
We'll do it.

07:35.267 --> 07:36.200
( <i>all cheer</i> )

07:36.267 --> 07:37.367
Okay, now, you're sure

07:37.434 --> 07:39.400
this guy's work
is going to go up, right?

07:39.467 --> 07:40.801
I'm positive.

07:40.868 --> 07:43.434
Well, because there's
this thing, you know,

07:43.501 --> 07:46.000
um, that I really
don't want to talk about

07:46.067 --> 07:48.968
because it's terrible
and sort of ghoulish.

07:49.033 --> 07:50.100
Well, what is that?

07:50.167 --> 07:52.100
Well... well, okay.

07:52.167 --> 07:54.567
It's kind of morbid, you know,

07:54.634 --> 07:58.033
but it's a reality
of the art business.

07:58.100 --> 08:00.934
See, um...
Max Duffin is an old man,

08:01.000 --> 08:03.267
and he's in very bad health.

08:03.334 --> 08:07.968
And, well, uh, an artist's work
always goes up in value

08:08.033 --> 08:09.934
after the artist... dies.

08:12.434 --> 08:13.567
Oh, yeah?

08:13.634 --> 08:15.100
Yeah, I've known works

08:15.167 --> 08:17.367
to triple and
quadruple in value

08:17.434 --> 08:20.000
the day after
the artist passed away.

08:20.067 --> 08:23.033
Oh, I'm feeling so creepy
even talking about it.

08:23.100 --> 08:25.367
Yeah, ooh, let's not talk
about that, no.

08:26.400 --> 08:28.367
How sick is he?

08:29.934 --> 08:32.734
Louie, I don't want
to talk about it.

08:32.801 --> 08:33.967
Well, you don't
have to give me

08:34.033 --> 08:36.801
the gruesome details.

08:36.868 --> 08:39.133
Can he eat solid food?

08:40.133 --> 08:42.000
Does he recognize visitors?

08:42.067 --> 08:43.667
Is he on any machines?

08:43.734 --> 08:47.067
I mean, is there a plug
somebody might accidentally...

08:47.133 --> 08:48.734
Whoop! Trip over?

08:48.801 --> 08:50.367
Hey, Louie, what do you care?

08:50.434 --> 08:52.767
Well, suddenly,
this investment interests me.

08:52.834 --> 08:55.234
I mean, as I see it, buying one
of the old geezer's paintings

08:55.300 --> 08:57.334
is like betting
he's going to die.

08:57.400 --> 08:58.467
We can't lose.

08:58.534 --> 08:59.567
What do you
mean "we"?

08:59.634 --> 09:01.501
I want in.

09:01.567 --> 09:02.567
Hey, forget it, Louie.

09:02.634 --> 09:03.667
No way, Louie.

09:03.734 --> 09:05.400
No, wait a minute, hold on.

09:05.467 --> 09:08.267
You two dumb bozos can't
decide for everybody.

09:08.334 --> 09:10.734
All the dumb bozos
have to have a say.

09:12.767 --> 09:15.434
All right, let's be
democratic about it.

09:15.501 --> 09:16.601
All those
in favor

09:16.667 --> 09:18.734
of keeping Louie
out of this deal

09:18.801 --> 09:21.000
signify so by
spitting on
his shoes.

09:21.067 --> 09:22.534
Now, wait,
hold on, here.

09:22.601 --> 09:24.234
You better
think this over.

09:24.300 --> 09:26.033
I mean, this is not
penny-ante stuff here.

09:26.100 --> 09:29.300
I mean, we're dealing with
big stakes here, boys and girls.

09:29.367 --> 09:32.200
You need somebody
who's got a bankroll.

09:32.267 --> 09:35.133
I got money.

09:36.868 --> 09:38.434
Why don't we vote on it?

09:38.501 --> 09:39.667
Maybe we should.

09:39.734 --> 09:41.200
BOBBY:
Oh, we don't
need to vote...

09:41.267 --> 09:43.701
No, I think we do.
Uh, Louie...

09:43.767 --> 09:45.501
Would you mind giving us
a little privacy

09:45.567 --> 09:46.968
so we can talk about this?

09:47.033 --> 09:48.601
Why, certainly.

09:48.667 --> 09:51.067
I'll just sit over here

09:51.133 --> 09:53.167
turn my back away and,
uh, you know,

09:53.234 --> 09:55.467
you just pretend
I'm not in the room,

09:55.534 --> 09:57.767
and I'll respect
the confidentiality

09:57.834 --> 09:59.100
of your discussion.

10:02.634 --> 10:03.801
I hate him.

10:03.868 --> 10:05.634
Okay, look,
maybe he's right.

10:05.701 --> 10:07.400
Maybe we do
need his money.

10:07.467 --> 10:09.334
No. Come on,
we got enough
amongst ourselves.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.100
How much you said
we needed, $2,000?

10:11.167 --> 10:12.434
Yeah.

10:12.501 --> 10:14.067
Okay. How much are we
all going to throw in?

10:14.133 --> 10:15.067
A ballpark
figure, Tony.

10:15.133 --> 10:16.067
What do you think?

10:16.133 --> 10:17.234
Oh, 200 bucks.

10:17.300 --> 10:18.434
All right. Bobby?

10:18.501 --> 10:19.434
About the same.

10:19.501 --> 10:21.067
Elaine?
Maybe $250?

10:21.133 --> 10:22.133
ALEX:
Good. Latka?

10:22.200 --> 10:24.434
350 <i>Brokniks.</i>

10:24.501 --> 10:26.767
How much is that
in American money?

10:26.834 --> 10:28.167
Nothing.

10:29.100 --> 10:30.200
Jim, Jim...

10:30.267 --> 10:31.267
$18.

10:31.334 --> 10:32.634
Is that all?

10:32.701 --> 10:34.868
Hey, I can buy and sell Latka.

10:37.367 --> 10:39.300
Okay, uh, so
without you, Alex,

10:39.367 --> 10:40.567
we have about $700

10:40.634 --> 10:42.167
and with you
we have...?

10:42.234 --> 10:43.701
A desperate need for Louie.

10:43.767 --> 10:46.200
I'm sorry. I blew my whole
bankroll on that skiing trip.

10:46.267 --> 10:47.334
I'm sorry.

10:47.400 --> 10:48.400
Okay, but no-- guys,
this is our chance.

10:48.467 --> 10:50.067
Come on, this
one painting

10:50.133 --> 10:51.334
could do it for us.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.434
Really. Whatever we have
to do we should do it.

10:53.501 --> 10:54.434
Trust me on this.

10:54.501 --> 10:56.200
I'm the practical
one, remember?

10:56.267 --> 10:58.801
Guess there's only
one way to settle it.

10:58.868 --> 11:00.267
Let's vote.

11:00.334 --> 11:02.334
Okay, but look, let's make
it unanimous-- unanimous.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.434
Otherwise, he's
not in, okay?

11:04.501 --> 11:05.667
( <i>all agree</i> )
Jim.

11:05.734 --> 11:08.033
All those in favor
of keeping Louie in,

11:08.100 --> 11:09.801
raise your hands.

11:16.801 --> 11:20.968
Raise it or lose
it, Wheeler.

11:21.968 --> 11:23.634
That a boy.

11:38.567 --> 11:42.033
You know, I... I've-I've heard
that there's a thrill

11:42.100 --> 11:44.434
associated with coming
in contact with great art,

11:44.501 --> 11:47.234
but I never realized how true
it was until this very moment.

11:47.300 --> 11:49.100
Bobby, these are just prints.

11:49.167 --> 11:51.434
They're copies
of original paintings.

11:51.501 --> 11:53.100
They're almost
worthless.

11:53.167 --> 11:54.467
The actual paintings
for auction

11:54.534 --> 11:56.434
are in the other room.

11:56.501 --> 11:57.667
Oh.

11:58.834 --> 12:00.801
Alex, just so you'll be
informed,

12:00.868 --> 12:03.167
I want to explain
what this paddle is for.

12:03.234 --> 12:04.167
You see, you use it...

12:04.234 --> 12:05.701
I know what
it's for, Elaine.

12:05.767 --> 12:07.000
I'm not a total dummy.

12:07.067 --> 12:09.067
I know something
about the world of culture.

12:09.133 --> 12:10.400
Okay.

12:10.467 --> 12:12.067
Hey, what's it for?

12:12.133 --> 12:14.267
What do you mean,
this paddle?
Yeah.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.334
Well, it's for making your bid.
Well, it's for making
your bid.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.000
You hold it up to be
You hold it up to be

12:18.067 --> 12:20.334
recognized by
the auctioneer.
recognized by the auctioneer.

12:20.400 --> 12:21.834
Does that explain it
for you, Bob?

12:30.934 --> 12:33.634
Oh, good, you gave Latka
the day off.

12:33.701 --> 12:35.567
Yeah, I told him
that all he had to do

12:35.634 --> 12:39.267
is fix the problem in cab 643,
he could come with us.

12:39.334 --> 12:40.734
Oh, did you
get it fixed?

12:40.801 --> 12:42.167
Uh... almost.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.634
What's that?

12:46.701 --> 12:49.667
Uh... uh...
I don't know.

12:49.734 --> 12:52.167
That's the problem.

12:52.834 --> 12:54.501
Oh, no.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.133
Jim...

13:02.200 --> 13:04.667
I thought you were
going to dress up.

13:04.734 --> 13:06.534
Yeah, I loaned
you a suit. What happened?

13:06.601 --> 13:10.734
I know, but it didn't
fit me, except the tie.

13:10.801 --> 13:12.200
As luck would have it,

13:12.267 --> 13:15.567
we've got the
same tie size.

13:15.634 --> 13:18.567
Yeah, that
is lucky.

13:18.634 --> 13:19.634
Guys, why
don't we go in

13:19.701 --> 13:20.667
and get
a good seat.

13:20.734 --> 13:22.000
Oh, okay.

13:27.267 --> 13:28.367
Whew. Hey, Elaine

13:28.434 --> 13:30.667
better tell us
what to do in there.

13:30.734 --> 13:33.067
We never been to
nothing like this.

13:33.133 --> 13:35.033
Oh, Tony, don't worry
about it, just relax.

13:35.100 --> 13:36.567
I'm going to take
care of the bidding,

13:36.634 --> 13:40.067
so, uh, you guys just try to
maintain an air of dignity.

13:43.968 --> 13:45.234
So...

13:45.300 --> 13:47.567
Miss Nardo,
which one is ours?

13:47.634 --> 13:49.434
( <i>whispers</i> )

13:49.501 --> 13:50.667
Oh.

13:51.868 --> 13:55.033
This is worth
2,000 bucks?

13:55.100 --> 13:58.400
Yes, and it's
going up as we're
talking about it.

13:58.467 --> 14:00.067
Gee, you know, it's untitled.

14:00.133 --> 14:02.267
For 2,000 bucks, you'd think
they'd throw in a name.

14:04.100 --> 14:05.901
You... you
know something?

14:05.968 --> 14:07.200
I like it.

14:07.267 --> 14:08.501
LATKA:
Me, too.

14:08.567 --> 14:09.801
It is
very pretty.

14:09.868 --> 14:10.868
Yeah?

14:10.934 --> 14:12.033
Well, enjoy it all
you want now,

14:12.100 --> 14:13.801
because we're only
holding onto this rag

14:13.868 --> 14:16.133
until the old
geezer croaks,

14:16.200 --> 14:18.234
and then it's gone.

14:18.300 --> 14:20.200
Well, on that
inspiring note,

14:20.267 --> 14:22.601
I think we better
take our seats.

14:22.667 --> 14:26.200
Why don't we sit in the front
where we can be heard?

14:26.267 --> 14:28.567
But there's only
one seat left in the front.

14:28.634 --> 14:30.133
Not for long.

14:31.968 --> 14:34.901
( <i>starts to cough</i> )

14:34.968 --> 14:36.234
( <i>clears throat</i> )

14:36.300 --> 14:39.567
( <i>hawks up phlegm</i> )

14:39.634 --> 14:41.667

14:41.734 --> 14:43.868

14:43.934 --> 14:47.734

14:49.000 --> 14:49.934
( <i>snorts</i> )

14:50.000 --> 14:53.300
( <i>coughing</i> )

14:54.334 --> 14:56.167
Way to go, Louie.

15:06.501 --> 15:08.167
It's just what
I expected--

15:08.234 --> 15:09.968
they estimate our
painting will sell

15:10.033 --> 15:13.300
for between $1,000
and $1,800.

15:13.367 --> 15:15.801
We only have $2,000.

15:15.868 --> 15:19.033
Louie, are you sure you
can't go any further?

15:19.100 --> 15:21.467
I told you, I got
every penny I own

15:21.534 --> 15:22.901
sunk into this deal.

15:22.968 --> 15:25.734
I thought you said you
had a lot of money.

15:25.801 --> 15:27.434
Yeah, but it's
not in cash.

15:27.501 --> 15:30.400
Most of my assets are
tied up in investments.

15:30.467 --> 15:33.400
I know I'm going to
regret asking this:

15:33.467 --> 15:35.300
what sort of investments

15:35.367 --> 15:37.767
are your assets
tied up in, Lou?

15:37.834 --> 15:41.167
Well, right now all my money's
in a nursing home in Jersey.

15:41.234 --> 15:43.501
I mean, you know, nursing homes
are a really good deal.

15:43.567 --> 15:46.501
The only problem is
the people that run this one

15:46.567 --> 15:48.434
spend too much money on upkeep,
you know,

15:48.501 --> 15:51.267
and there's not enough profits
to go around.

15:51.334 --> 15:53.167
Why don't you
straighten them out, Lou?

15:53.234 --> 15:55.501
I tried. I told them,

15:55.567 --> 15:58.434
"Those people don't eat
three meals a day." I mean,

15:58.501 --> 16:00.167
their memories are so bad

16:00.234 --> 16:03.434
they don't know whether they
had three meals or a cracker.

16:03.501 --> 16:05.534
I say let them sleep.

16:05.601 --> 16:06.767
Louie?

16:06.834 --> 16:08.901
What?

16:08.968 --> 16:11.634
You're a
slime, Louie.

16:11.701 --> 16:14.701
Ladies and gentlemen, we're
about to begin the auction.

16:14.767 --> 16:15.868
All right,
all right,

16:15.934 --> 16:18.601
let's settle down here
and concentrate.

16:18.667 --> 16:20.400
Our first item today

16:20.467 --> 16:23.234
will be a painting
by Wallace Leidegger

16:23.300 --> 16:25.234
entitled <i>Nude at Daybreak.</i>

16:25.300 --> 16:26.634
All right!

16:34.634 --> 16:37.734
My God, I know her!

16:44.300 --> 16:47.734
She's dyed her hair,
but that's her.

16:47.801 --> 16:49.801
Jim, Jim,
sit down.

16:51.067 --> 16:54.200
And may we have $1,800
to start, please?

16:54.267 --> 16:57.167
$1,800. Thank you--
$1,800 is bid.

16:57.234 --> 16:59.934
19 for it-- $1,900.
Now $2,000.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.334
LOUIE:
Hey, Elaine, our
painting's next.

17:02.400 --> 17:04.800
Now, as I see it,
it's in our best interest

17:04.867 --> 17:06.166
that we make
everybody else think

17:06.233 --> 17:07.166
it's worthless, right?

17:07.233 --> 17:09.701
Louie, please.

17:09.767 --> 17:13.200
Our next painting is
another work by Max Duffin.

17:13.267 --> 17:14.534
Yike!

17:14.601 --> 17:16.067
Whew!

17:16.133 --> 17:18.233
How did that
get in here?

17:18.300 --> 17:20.133
( <i>blows a raspberry</i> )

17:20.200 --> 17:21.534
Yuck!

17:21.601 --> 17:23.601
Ugh!

17:23.666 --> 17:26.666
This painting is untitled.

17:26.733 --> 17:28.133
I got one for it.

17:28.200 --> 17:29.934
How about "Garbage"?

17:30.000 --> 17:31.701
( <i>all shushing Louie</i> )

17:31.767 --> 17:33.300
What is
wrong with you?

17:33.367 --> 17:35.634
Okay, listen,
everybody, this is it.

17:35.701 --> 17:37.200
Now, pay attention.

17:37.267 --> 17:39.767
May we have $1,000
to start this painting, please?

17:39.834 --> 17:41.000
$1,000--
Thank you.

17:41.067 --> 17:42.234
$1,000...
$1,000.

17:42.300 --> 17:43.467
$1,100.

17:43.534 --> 17:45.534
now at 11-- $1,100 is bid-- 12.

17:45.601 --> 17:47.300
$1,200...
Now at 12.

17:47.367 --> 17:48.267
$1,300, please.

17:49.300 --> 17:50.901
$1,300 is
bid... 14.

17:50.968 --> 17:52.100
$1,400.

17:52.167 --> 17:53.434
It's going too fast.

17:53.501 --> 17:54.734
Fifteen.

17:54.801 --> 17:56.400
$1,500...

17:56.467 --> 17:57.968
Going at
14... 15.

17:58.033 --> 17:59.534
$1,500.

17:59.601 --> 18:00.934
Oh, you...

18:01.000 --> 18:02.467
What's with
this guy?

18:02.534 --> 18:03.934
It's getting too high!

18:04.000 --> 18:06.267
Well, let's bring
it down a little.

18:06.334 --> 18:09.968
One hundred bucks,
and that's my final offer!

18:10.033 --> 18:11.267
At $1,500.

18:11.334 --> 18:14.634
$1,600... and don't
do that again, sir.

18:14.701 --> 18:16.601
$1,600 once... and 17.

18:17.534 --> 18:19.801
You're getting on my nerves!

18:22.133 --> 18:23.667
18... $1,800
is bid.

18:23.734 --> 18:26.234
19... $1,900... now at $1,900.

18:26.300 --> 18:28.434
$2,000...
$2,000.

18:28.501 --> 18:30.501
$2,000 at two.

18:30.567 --> 18:32.901
At $2,000 once...

18:32.968 --> 18:34.400
We got it, we got it.

18:34.467 --> 18:35.834
$2,000 twice...

18:35.901 --> 18:37.467
Oh, we got it,
we got it, we got it!

18:37.534 --> 18:39.968
$2,000 third...

18:40.033 --> 18:41.634
and $2,100
is bid.

18:41.701 --> 18:43.968
You better hope you don't
spend your twilight years

18:44.033 --> 18:45.167
at Sunset Acres!

18:45.234 --> 18:46.267
( <i>growls</i> )

18:50.501 --> 18:52.467
Hey, listen,
we need more money!

18:52.534 --> 18:54.167
Yeah. Louie, don't
you have any more?

18:54.234 --> 18:55.434
I told you
it's all I got!

18:55.501 --> 18:56.734
Somebody's got to
have some money, man.

18:58.434 --> 19:00.767
I can't believe we're
going to lose this
painting for $100.

19:00.834 --> 19:02.701
$2,200.

19:02.767 --> 19:03.868
For $200.

19:03.934 --> 19:05.133
$2,200...
23...

19:05.200 --> 19:07.434
Oh, great, now all
we need is $400.

19:07.501 --> 19:08.567
Now may we hear 25?

19:08.634 --> 19:09.767
May we see 25?

19:09.834 --> 19:12.033
Thank you,
sir, $2,500.

19:12.100 --> 19:14.133
25, 26... going to ask 27, 28...

19:14.200 --> 19:16.234
go for broke-- what do you care?

19:16.300 --> 19:17.901
Look at your
nice suit...!

19:17.968 --> 19:21.133
You probably got a maid
and a butler!

19:21.200 --> 19:22.634
( <i>chair crashing</i> )

19:22.701 --> 19:25.901
You got maids,
you got everything!

19:25.968 --> 19:27.267
At 2,500...

19:29.400 --> 19:30.868
At 25...
may we have

19:30.934 --> 19:32.467
$2,700, please?

19:32.534 --> 19:34.133
May we... $2,700.

19:34.200 --> 19:36.300
$2,700...
now 29.

19:36.367 --> 19:38.434
$2,900,
$2,900 is bid...

19:38.501 --> 19:40.200
At $2,900.

19:40.267 --> 19:42.467
At $2,900
once...

19:42.534 --> 19:45.400
at $2,900 twice...

19:45.467 --> 19:48.534
at $2,900...

19:48.601 --> 19:49.701
and sold

19:49.767 --> 19:54.367
for $2,900,
number 498.

19:58.801 --> 20:02.133
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have some bad news for you.

20:04.067 --> 20:06.868
I have just been
handed a note

20:06.934 --> 20:08.601
that Max Duffin, the artist

20:08.667 --> 20:11.000
of the last two paintings
that we sold,

20:11.067 --> 20:13.100
died this morning
at his home in New Mexico.

20:13.167 --> 20:14.634
Oh, no!

20:14.701 --> 20:16.100
That's not fair!

20:16.167 --> 20:17.467
That's not...

20:17.534 --> 20:19.033
God, why, God?

20:21.067 --> 20:22.300
Well...

20:22.367 --> 20:24.334
this should be
a lesson to me.

20:24.400 --> 20:26.834
I thought maybe,
maybe just this once,

20:26.901 --> 20:30.267
maybe once, I could have
some dealings with losers

20:30.334 --> 20:31.601
and not get burned.

20:31.667 --> 20:32.801
It can't be done.

20:32.868 --> 20:34.434
It just cannot be done.

20:34.501 --> 20:36.567
But, you know, if you guys
were at Normandy,

20:36.634 --> 20:38.968
we'd all be eating strudel
right now.

20:39.033 --> 20:40.901
Oh, come on, Louie,
knock it off.

20:40.968 --> 20:41.901
We feel as bad
as you do.

20:41.968 --> 20:43.234
No, you don't.

20:43.300 --> 20:44.634
Now you don't.

20:44.701 --> 20:47.100
Defeat and humiliation
are a way of life for you.

20:47.167 --> 20:48.567
It's bad for my system.

20:49.601 --> 20:50.934
Elaine, what happened?

20:51.000 --> 20:52.200
How come everything

20:52.267 --> 20:54.100
was more than
we could afford?

20:54.167 --> 20:56.167
It just goes to
prove one thing:

20:56.234 --> 20:58.534
You got to <i>have</i>
money to <i>make</i> money.

20:58.601 --> 21:00.634
I must admit
I feel pretty silly

21:00.701 --> 21:02.968
getting all dressed
up for nothing.

21:05.133 --> 21:06.367
Come on.

21:06.434 --> 21:08.400
Come on, let's go to Mario's,
have a beer.

21:08.467 --> 21:09.501
Okay, yeah.

21:10.534 --> 21:11.901
You guys
go on ahead.

21:11.968 --> 21:13.434
I'm going
to stay here

21:13.501 --> 21:15.334
and look around
for a while.

21:15.400 --> 21:16.267
Look around at what?

21:16.334 --> 21:17.701
I came here to buy

21:17.767 --> 21:19.033
a... piece of art.

21:19.100 --> 21:23.400
I feel like...
buying a piece of art.

21:23.467 --> 21:25.868
I mean, uh, I'm going to buy
one of these things.

21:27.734 --> 21:29.534
They are for sale, aren't they?

21:29.601 --> 21:30.667
Mm-hmm.

21:30.734 --> 21:32.634
So, they may not be original.

21:32.701 --> 21:34.868
I mean, I may not make
any money from it.

21:34.934 --> 21:36.200
I'm not, am I?

21:37.567 --> 21:39.767
So what? I'm going to
buy something I like.

21:39.834 --> 21:43.534
Well...
actually, I...

21:43.601 --> 21:46.601
there is some stuff here
I kind of like, too.

21:46.667 --> 21:48.000
Yeah, maybe I'll
buy something, too.

21:48.067 --> 21:49.367
I got some wall
space to cover up.

21:49.434 --> 21:51.367
Well, yeah, let's look around.

21:51.434 --> 21:52.968
And, you know, if you don't see
anything you like here,

21:53.033 --> 21:55.334
I know a lot of places.

21:55.400 --> 21:56.334
Okay.

21:56.400 --> 21:57.667
Yeah.

22:00.033 --> 22:01.501
LOUIE:
Nardo...

22:01.567 --> 22:03.667
I mean, what's
the big deal here?

22:03.734 --> 22:05.934
I mean, why buy
any of this junk

22:06.000 --> 22:07.300
if it's worthless?

22:07.367 --> 22:09.434
Louie, I think
it has a value

22:09.501 --> 22:11.467
that you can't
understand.

22:11.534 --> 22:13.000
Hold on, here.

22:13.067 --> 22:15.467
Now, correct me if I'm wrong,

22:15.534 --> 22:18.834
but I think
you just called me a slob.

22:18.901 --> 22:20.133
I mean,

22:20.200 --> 22:22.734
I'll show you
what kind of slob I am.

22:22.801 --> 22:25.000
Hey, there, cookie.

22:25.067 --> 22:27.801
I want one of your
classiest things here--

22:27.868 --> 22:31.767
something by... Vincent Van
Patten, or one of those guys.

22:34.734 --> 22:35.801
ALEX:
Hey, Elaine?

22:35.868 --> 22:38.000
This is a reproduction,
isn't it?

22:38.067 --> 22:39.367
Mm-hmm.

22:39.434 --> 22:40.767
Is it good?

22:40.834 --> 22:42.133
Do you like it?

22:42.200 --> 22:44.167
Yeah, I like it
a lot.

22:44.234 --> 22:45.767
Then that's good.

22:45.834 --> 22:47.434
Then I'm going to buy it.

22:47.501 --> 22:49.100
Okay.

22:49.167 --> 22:50.934
Come on...

22:51.000 --> 22:52.834
with me.

24:05.334 --> 24:07.634

Night, Mr. Walters.
