00:16.880 --> 00:18.980
_

00:28.182 --> 00:31.551
So, based on the
photos, this is the spot.

00:31.619 --> 00:33.787
Uh, I'm just trying to, uh...

00:37.725 --> 00:39.025
Hello?

00:43.864 --> 00:46.566
Okay, I just want to find a spot

00:46.634 --> 00:49.469
that I can watch without being seen.

00:57.077 --> 00:59.045
Whoa.

00:59.113 --> 01:00.680
That was crazy.

01:00.748 --> 01:05.051
Must have been some kind
of nocturnal cat, maybe.

01:05.119 --> 01:07.053
But we are still... Ah!

01:11.125 --> 01:13.660
♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom ♪

01:13.727 --> 01:16.262
♪ Bang, bang, bang, bang ♪

01:16.330 --> 01:18.765
♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom ♪

01:18.833 --> 01:20.266
♪ How, how, how, how ♪

01:20.334 --> 01:21.868
♪ Hey, hey ♪

01:28.109 --> 01:29.276
♪ You gotta come on. ♪

01:35.649 --> 01:37.750
You look like you got here real early.

01:37.818 --> 01:39.085
Uh, no.

01:39.153 --> 01:40.386
I stayed up really late.

01:40.454 --> 01:42.055
I was up all night going through

01:42.122 --> 01:45.592
the files Winchester gave me
on Deputy Director Van Cleef.

01:45.659 --> 01:47.499
Did you read his grade
school transcripts, too?

01:47.500 --> 01:49.462
I might as well have.

01:49.530 --> 01:51.431
He dumped every file

01:51.498 --> 01:53.266
on every mission that
Van Cleef has worked on

01:53.334 --> 01:54.901
for the past seven years.

01:54.969 --> 01:59.138
This... this is every mission
he ever led personally,

01:59.206 --> 02:00.707
including when I worked with him.

02:00.774 --> 02:02.375
- Way to go, Winchester.
- Yeah.

02:02.443 --> 02:05.445
I guess after saving both
his life and his career

02:05.512 --> 02:08.080
taking down that DIA mole,
he was feeling generous.

02:08.148 --> 02:09.883
Read your file yet?

02:09.949 --> 02:12.285
You know, after all these
years, I don't know.

02:12.353 --> 02:14.888
I just... I couldn't.

02:14.915 --> 02:16.235
You'll read it when you're ready.

02:16.236 --> 02:17.657
Yeah.

02:17.725 --> 02:20.960
Anyway, I did go through the
other operations, though.

02:21.028 --> 02:22.295
Find a pattern of behavior?

02:22.363 --> 02:24.898
It's the way he handled
disciplinary actions.

02:24.965 --> 02:28.801
He cited 15 senior female field agents

02:28.869 --> 02:31.671
for things like breaches of
protocol, poor judgment.

02:31.739 --> 02:33.473
They all had otherwise clean records.

02:33.540 --> 02:34.741
Any male agents?

02:34.808 --> 02:36.576
Three. But...

02:36.644 --> 02:38.244
they had all been previously disciplined

02:38.245 --> 02:39.612
by other supervisors.

02:39.680 --> 02:40.947
Hmm.

02:41.015 --> 02:42.849
I'm beginning to think,

02:42.917 --> 02:45.285
unconsciously or not,

02:45.352 --> 02:47.787
Van Cleef has a problem
with female field agents.

02:47.815 --> 02:49.255
You really think it was unconscious?

02:49.256 --> 02:50.957
- I'm being kind.
- Mm.

02:51.025 --> 02:52.665
Well, you really did
dig into the pattern.

02:52.693 --> 02:54.594
Let's look into promotions,
demotions, firings.

02:54.662 --> 02:56.095
And let's see if there's any

02:56.144 --> 02:57.664
gender-based trends in the areas, too.

02:57.665 --> 02:59.933
- Look, Tammy, you don't have to.
- Are you kidding?

03:00.000 --> 03:01.100
If this is what's really...

03:01.168 --> 03:02.702
I'm kicking a hornet's nest.

03:04.004 --> 03:05.939
If this pattern really does exist,

03:06.006 --> 03:07.526
then that's a nest that needs kicking,

03:07.541 --> 03:08.808
and I'm all in.

03:08.876 --> 03:09.996
I'm sure Pride will be, too.

03:10.044 --> 03:11.924
Pride already went to bat
for me with Van Cleef.

03:11.992 --> 03:13.752
I don't want him sticking
his neck out again.

03:13.753 --> 03:15.140
Okay.

03:24.425 --> 03:25.825
- Dwayne.
- Linda,

03:25.893 --> 03:28.628
what... what are you doing here?

03:28.696 --> 03:30.697
It's nice to see you, too.

03:30.764 --> 03:34.067
Sorry. I just, I just
wasn't expecting...

03:34.134 --> 03:36.536
What, your ex-wife showing
up without calling or texting?

03:36.603 --> 03:38.571
- Exactly.
- Well, it's the big

03:38.639 --> 03:41.007
- planning of the wedding weekend.
- I just thought that

03:41.075 --> 03:43.242
that would start, you
know, on-on the weekend.

03:43.310 --> 03:44.477
Well, it is.

03:44.545 --> 03:46.412
But Laurel, I mean, she's...

03:46.480 --> 03:48.314
we only have two days.

03:48.382 --> 03:50.582
There's venues and there's
flowers and there's catering,

03:50.583 --> 03:52.819
and so I just came a little early.

03:52.886 --> 03:55.922
Right. Well...

03:55.990 --> 03:57.190
welcome.

03:57.257 --> 03:58.524
Uh, can I get you a coffee?

03:58.592 --> 04:00.360
- Or breakfast, or...?
- No, no, I'm good.

04:00.427 --> 04:01.761
I actually just came in

04:01.829 --> 04:03.663
for an awkward hello.

04:03.731 --> 04:06.933
And then go and make my rounds.

04:07.001 --> 04:09.836
Well, mission accomplished.

04:09.903 --> 04:12.071
All right, I admit it.

04:12.139 --> 04:14.107
I mean, I knew you bought the place.

04:14.174 --> 04:17.777
But I just kind of wanted
to see it for myself and

04:17.845 --> 04:22.382
tell you that I'm really
glad that it's finally yours.

04:22.449 --> 04:24.517
Thank you.

04:25.753 --> 04:28.021
How's everything in, uh, in Houston?

04:28.088 --> 04:29.088
It's good.

04:29.156 --> 04:31.457
Ted and I celebrated
our fourth anniversary.

04:31.525 --> 04:34.027
Wow. Congratulations.

04:34.094 --> 04:36.095
- How are you and Rita?
- We're great.

04:36.163 --> 04:37.230
Hmm.

04:37.297 --> 04:39.385
Let me just make you something to
eat before you have to rush out.

04:39.386 --> 04:41.546
- No, no, I'm not gonna put you out.
- Let me get this.

04:41.547 --> 04:43.068
You're not putting me... out at all.

04:43.103 --> 04:45.138
Okay?

04:47.941 --> 04:51.077
Um, it's, it's a case.

04:51.145 --> 04:54.080
Yeah. It-It's okay. I-I-I
have a lot to get done,

04:54.148 --> 04:55.381
so...

04:55.449 --> 04:56.949
It was great to see you.

05:07.227 --> 05:09.328
Morning. What've we got?

05:09.396 --> 05:11.931
Victim was Lieutenant Daniel Sloan.

05:11.999 --> 05:13.566
Naval microbiologist.

05:13.634 --> 05:15.514
Looks like the body was
dragged out of the water

05:15.569 --> 05:17.804
and mauled by some kind of wild animal.

05:17.871 --> 05:20.191
- How long was it in the water?
- A few hours.

05:20.207 --> 05:23.076
- Probably went in somewhere upstream.
- Time of death?

05:23.143 --> 05:25.945
I'm putting it somewhere
around six to ten hours ago.

05:26.013 --> 05:27.180
Middle of the night.

05:29.076 --> 05:30.516
What the hell was he doing out here?

05:30.517 --> 05:32.285
Good question.

05:32.352 --> 05:34.272
The local sheriffs are
still canvassing the area,

05:34.273 --> 05:36.756
but no sign of any vehicle or
witnesses for that matter.

05:36.824 --> 05:38.158
So it could've been dumped.

05:38.225 --> 05:40.560
These waters aren't a bad
place to dump a body.

05:40.561 --> 05:42.095
Another day or so, alligators could've

05:42.162 --> 05:44.162
- disposed of the corpse.
- You thinking foul play?

05:44.163 --> 05:45.331
Can't rule it out.

05:45.399 --> 05:46.999
We'll see when we get to the morgue.

05:47.067 --> 05:48.634
Okay.

05:48.702 --> 05:51.871
Let's start digging into
Lieutenant Sloan's life.

05:56.443 --> 05:57.910
Hey.

05:59.246 --> 06:00.613
You got a sec?

06:00.641 --> 06:02.241
Well, if this is about that fancy bottle

06:02.242 --> 06:03.616
of whiskey you loaned me,

06:03.684 --> 06:05.818
- I'll buy you a new one.
- It's not about that.

06:05.886 --> 06:08.221
It's about Deputy Director Van Cleef.

06:08.288 --> 06:09.555
You were right.

06:09.623 --> 06:12.391
He was responsible for my
demotion as team leader.

06:12.459 --> 06:15.695
- And there is a history there.
- That you don't have to explain.

06:15.762 --> 06:17.663
I don't need to know.
It's not my business.

06:17.731 --> 06:18.865
No, it's okay, I want to.

06:18.932 --> 06:21.033
Here's the thing, I've been trying

06:21.101 --> 06:23.136
to locate people... women...

06:23.203 --> 06:24.803
who have had similar
experiences to mine,

06:24.804 --> 06:25.805
to talk to.

06:25.873 --> 06:27.424
You want to tank his DOD appointment?

06:27.425 --> 06:30.009
I want to make sure all the
relevant information is out there.

06:30.077 --> 06:32.411
I never took you for the
David and Goliath type.

06:32.479 --> 06:35.816
Neither did I but... here I am.

06:35.883 --> 06:37.717
What do you need?

06:37.784 --> 06:39.864
You said that you worked
with someone at Pearl Harbor

06:39.865 --> 06:42.088
who had a run-in with Van Cleef?

06:42.156 --> 06:44.236
Look, I think the name of
that woman is Emily Landau.

06:44.291 --> 06:46.058
And I've been trying
to get ahold of her,

06:46.126 --> 06:49.095
but she doesn't work for NCIS anymore.

06:53.133 --> 06:54.500
You know what? Never mind.

06:54.568 --> 06:57.904
I can find her, if that's what you want.

06:57.971 --> 07:00.540
If she's open to talking to
you, I can connect you.

07:00.607 --> 07:02.175
But if she's not, I won't.

07:02.242 --> 07:04.210
You're protective of her. I get it.

07:04.278 --> 07:07.079
Van Cleef is a powerful
man with powerful friends.

07:07.147 --> 07:08.781
He could hurt her and he can hurt you.

07:08.849 --> 07:10.416
- You, too.
- Yeah, but...

07:10.484 --> 07:12.084
I hate a bully.

07:12.152 --> 07:13.586
And I love a fight.

07:13.634 --> 07:14.754
I couldn't believe it

07:14.755 --> 07:16.122
when I heard he was dead.

07:16.190 --> 07:18.191
- I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

07:18.258 --> 07:20.793
It's all anyone can talk about.

07:20.861 --> 07:23.196
Do you know of anyone who
would want to hurt him?

07:23.263 --> 07:24.263
Dan? Are you kidding?

07:24.331 --> 07:25.464
He was a great guy.

07:25.532 --> 07:27.200
What was he working on here?

07:27.267 --> 07:29.769
We've been optimizing the
diagnosis and prevention kits

07:29.836 --> 07:32.305
for infectious diseases
in different areas.

07:32.372 --> 07:34.052
Any idea what he was
doing out in the bayou

07:34.107 --> 07:35.274
in the middle of the night?

07:35.342 --> 07:36.943
Everybody could tell you that.

07:37.010 --> 07:38.978
He was hunting monsters.

07:39.046 --> 07:42.215
Dan's hobby was myth-busting.

07:42.282 --> 07:43.583
Seriously?

07:43.650 --> 07:44.817
Yeah, he believed there was

07:44.885 --> 07:47.753
a scientific explanation for everything.

07:47.821 --> 07:50.102
- He was gonna do a podcast about it.
- You know what, uh,

07:50.103 --> 07:53.292
what creature he was
out there chasing, or...?

07:53.360 --> 07:55.728
Dan had heard something about
some nocturnal swamp creature,

07:55.796 --> 07:57.129
I forget what it's called.

07:57.197 --> 07:58.497
The, uh, the tougaloo?

07:58.565 --> 08:00.600
Rougarou! It's the bayou werewolf.

08:00.667 --> 08:01.768
That's awesome. Wow.

08:01.836 --> 08:03.169
What a great idea for a podcast.

08:03.237 --> 08:04.397
I've got some theories myself

08:04.404 --> 08:05.964
that I've been working on... nothing...

08:07.207 --> 08:09.175
Dan saw a bunch of photos online

08:09.243 --> 08:10.810
a couple weeks ago. Supposedly

08:10.877 --> 08:12.578
sightings of the whatchamacallit.

08:12.646 --> 08:14.947
- Rougarou.
- He talked about it all the time.

08:15.015 --> 08:16.495
He went out there to see for himself.

08:16.550 --> 08:18.484
Maybe it... maybe it's real after all?

08:18.552 --> 08:19.786
- No.
- Maybe.

08:27.011 --> 08:29.579
I think I would've liked
Lieutenant Sloan.

08:29.647 --> 08:31.114
Really?

08:31.182 --> 08:34.017
Yeah, he was a scientist with
a soft spot for urban legends.

08:34.085 --> 08:35.852
You know? What's not to like?

08:35.919 --> 08:37.640
I know we're not supposed
to think that way.

08:37.640 --> 08:40.190
It's never wrong to
acknowledge the humanity

08:40.258 --> 08:41.825
of the victims we encounter.

08:41.893 --> 08:44.160
- Well, what happened to him?
- Bruising of the back

08:44.227 --> 08:46.496
of the neck, petechial
hemorrhaging in the eyes.

08:46.564 --> 08:49.132
- He was strangled?
- I am ruling it as a homicide,

08:49.200 --> 08:50.967
but the cause of death is drowning.

08:51.035 --> 08:53.070
He had significant water in his lungs.

08:53.137 --> 08:55.539
So the killer held his head
underwater until he drowned.

08:55.606 --> 08:57.541
That's consistent with my findings.

08:57.608 --> 08:59.710
Well, what about these maulings?

08:59.777 --> 09:02.257
The lack of bleeding suggests
the injuries were inflicted

09:02.258 --> 09:03.313
postmortem.

09:03.381 --> 09:04.514
Any idea what caused them?

09:04.582 --> 09:06.483
This part you're gonna like.

09:06.551 --> 09:10.754
I found what appears to be
animal hair in the wounds.

09:10.822 --> 09:12.756
I'm sending it to the lab for analysis.

09:12.824 --> 09:15.392
Hair? You know, uh, rougarou's got hair.

09:15.460 --> 09:18.261
And it, uh, supposedly
it-it suffocates its victims

09:18.329 --> 09:19.696
before it eats them.

09:19.764 --> 09:21.331
So...

09:21.399 --> 09:23.559
I'm not saying that there's
a bayou werewolf out there.

09:23.560 --> 09:26.002
Okay?

09:26.070 --> 09:27.771
A guy can dream, right?

09:29.407 --> 09:31.441
Emily Landau's phone number.

09:31.509 --> 09:33.443
You talked to her?
She's willing to talk?

09:33.511 --> 09:34.911
She's willing to listen.

09:34.979 --> 09:36.446
Now, she lives in Virginia.

09:36.514 --> 09:38.715
You can videoconference her
before the end of the day,

09:38.783 --> 09:40.283
as long as the connection is secure.

09:40.351 --> 09:41.885
- Today?
- The sooner the better.

09:41.953 --> 09:43.120
Before she gets cold feet.

09:43.187 --> 09:44.387
Look, if you're gonna do this,

09:44.455 --> 09:45.889
you need to do it before

09:45.957 --> 09:47.591
Van Cleef's confirmation hearing.

09:47.658 --> 09:48.925
Or it's pointless.

09:48.993 --> 09:51.261
You're right.

09:53.131 --> 09:54.931
Thank you.

10:00.070 --> 10:01.570
_

10:01.572 --> 10:02.572
Thank you so much

10:02.640 --> 10:03.640
for coming down here.

10:03.708 --> 10:05.275
So this is, uh,

10:05.343 --> 10:07.778
what Laurel's got her heart set on?

10:07.845 --> 10:09.579
Yeah, I, um...

10:09.647 --> 10:11.581
She was on lunch, I FaceTimed her,

10:11.649 --> 10:13.583
and she flipped over it.

10:13.651 --> 10:17.254
And since we're both breaking
our piggy banks for this,

10:17.321 --> 10:19.790
I just wanted to make
sure that you saw it

10:19.857 --> 10:22.859
before I made the deposit.

10:24.362 --> 10:26.630
Okay. It's pricey.

10:26.697 --> 10:28.598
But you have to admit,

10:28.666 --> 10:29.666
it's really lovely.

10:29.700 --> 10:32.202
- This is for one night?
- Yeah.

10:33.738 --> 10:35.172
Laurel loves it?

10:35.239 --> 10:36.373
Yes.

10:39.410 --> 10:41.144
Let's do it.

10:41.212 --> 10:42.979
Okay. I'm gonna pull the trigger.

10:43.047 --> 10:44.981
Yeah.

10:45.049 --> 10:48.285
You know, I'm starting to feel
like this whole wedding thing

10:48.352 --> 10:49.986
is really real.

10:50.054 --> 10:52.289
I've actually been thinking
about that all day.

10:52.356 --> 10:53.623
Our little girl,

10:53.691 --> 10:56.426
walking around with that
stuffed pig every day?

10:56.494 --> 10:58.128
Part of me was hoping that Laurel

10:58.196 --> 11:00.664
was gonna call and say,
"Cancel everything".

11:00.731 --> 11:02.833
Yeah, wouldn't that be nice?

11:05.536 --> 11:06.870
Are we awful?

11:06.938 --> 11:08.104
Probably.

11:08.172 --> 11:11.174
But it's just so sudden.

11:11.242 --> 11:14.110
I mean, she's marrying a
cop. That's a huge mistake.

11:14.178 --> 11:17.514
You're kidding, right?

11:20.418 --> 11:21.551
Look,

11:21.619 --> 11:23.453
David's a great guy.

11:23.521 --> 11:26.656
I'm sure he's a great guy, but
he's a great guy with a badge.

11:26.724 --> 11:29.192
I mean, why are you hoping
that they're gonna call it off?

11:29.260 --> 11:32.696
I just felt like they're
just going too fast.

11:32.763 --> 11:35.532
But I got no problem with his career.

11:35.600 --> 11:36.967
Of course not.

11:37.034 --> 11:39.202
I mean, it means you get the last word.

11:39.270 --> 11:40.270
What's that mean?

11:40.304 --> 11:42.172
Laurel is marrying a cop.

11:42.240 --> 11:44.975
Just like Dad. I mean, come on.

11:45.042 --> 11:47.344
Laurel has made her
peace with what it means

11:47.411 --> 11:50.180
to live with a cop.

11:50.248 --> 11:53.183
As a daughter. Not a wife.

11:53.251 --> 11:55.518
Do you really want her waiting,

11:55.586 --> 11:58.054
worrying for the rest of her life?

11:58.122 --> 11:59.322
Wasn't always that bad, Linda.

11:59.390 --> 12:00.423
Really?

12:00.491 --> 12:01.892
Thanks for feeling that for me.

12:01.959 --> 12:03.093
That's not what I meant.

12:03.160 --> 12:05.161
I meant that there were good times, too.

12:05.229 --> 12:06.496
Of course there were.

12:06.564 --> 12:09.199
But the bad times
landed on my shoulders.

12:09.267 --> 12:11.268
Because it wasn't a problem for you.

12:11.335 --> 12:12.655
- Linda, come on.
- You know what?

12:12.656 --> 12:13.870
You were off being a hero,

12:13.938 --> 12:15.505
you were saving the city.

12:15.573 --> 12:16.907
But you're right.

12:16.974 --> 12:18.909
It was not the job.
It was never the job.

12:18.976 --> 12:21.845
Because you treated it like a calling,

12:21.913 --> 12:23.246
not a career.

12:23.314 --> 12:25.515
Why is it a crime to love my work?

12:25.583 --> 12:26.950
It's not.

12:27.018 --> 12:28.685
But the way you do it,

12:28.753 --> 12:31.388
there's not any room for anything else.

12:31.455 --> 12:34.858
And no matter how much I loved you,

12:34.926 --> 12:36.526
God, it-it would've been easier

12:36.594 --> 12:38.528
having a mistress.

12:38.596 --> 12:40.397
All those broken people,

12:40.464 --> 12:43.066
I couldn't compete with them.

12:43.134 --> 12:44.734
You're the one who left.

12:44.802 --> 12:45.802
You're the one

12:45.836 --> 12:47.604
who broke up the family, not me.

12:47.672 --> 12:49.739
I might've left last, but you were

12:49.807 --> 12:50.974
the first one to leave.

12:51.042 --> 12:53.276
Don't do that. We both agreed.

12:53.344 --> 12:55.478
We both agreed that
we needed time apart.

12:55.546 --> 12:58.348
I am not talking about
the separation, Dwayne.

12:59.617 --> 13:03.987
When you came home, you
promised to be present.

13:04.055 --> 13:05.455
To work at it.

13:05.523 --> 13:08.892
But I did. I was.

13:08.960 --> 13:10.493
For Laurel.

13:10.561 --> 13:13.330
You were a great dad.

13:13.397 --> 13:15.966
I would never deny you that.

13:16.033 --> 13:19.736
But you were not there for me.

13:30.247 --> 13:32.649
Pride.

13:34.652 --> 13:36.586
The SAC?

13:36.654 --> 13:38.989
Fine. But I'm in the middle
of something right now.

13:39.056 --> 13:41.992
I'll get there when I get there.

13:42.059 --> 13:43.960
- Just go.
- No. No.

13:44.028 --> 13:45.495
I want to finish this.

13:45.563 --> 13:47.464
We're finished, Dwayne.

13:47.531 --> 13:49.899
I really don't want to
fight with you anymore.

13:51.268 --> 13:53.269
I'm done.

13:56.674 --> 13:57.974
I found the photos

13:58.042 --> 14:00.043
Sloan found online of the swamp thing.

14:00.111 --> 14:02.351
It's called the rougarou. Do
the photos actually show it?

14:02.352 --> 14:04.881
What? No. Not even close,
'cause it's not a real thing.

14:04.949 --> 14:07.650
Yeah, I... You know that I
know that. I don't know why...

14:07.718 --> 14:09.718
Why is everyone treating
me like I don't know that?

14:09.719 --> 14:12.320
'Cause you still kind of
hope, and it's pathetic.

14:12.757 --> 14:14.624
_

14:14.692 --> 14:17.027
I mean, that's not
exactly proof positive.

14:17.094 --> 14:18.561
Must have intrigued him.

14:18.629 --> 14:21.297
Any info on who posted
the photos online?

14:21.365 --> 14:23.066
I.P. address belongs

14:23.134 --> 14:25.035
to a Cajun Creatures Swamp Tour.

14:25.102 --> 14:26.302
Hmm.

14:32.143 --> 14:34.044
Sure, I remember this
guy. Nice young man.

14:34.111 --> 14:36.513
He took the tour once or twice.

14:36.580 --> 14:38.548
He was, uh, interested in the rougarou.

14:38.616 --> 14:40.336
A lot of people who come on our tours

14:40.337 --> 14:41.818
believe in that foolishness.

14:41.886 --> 14:43.720
Well, I don't know if
I'd call it foolishness.

14:43.788 --> 14:46.108
Just because we run a swamp
tour doesn't mean we're morons.

14:46.157 --> 14:48.124
Oh, sure, but I'm just saying
that, you know, there's probably

14:48.125 --> 14:49.559
a lot of very smart people

14:49.627 --> 14:51.261
out there who keep an open mind

14:51.328 --> 14:53.396
- about this kind of thing.
- Of course.

14:53.464 --> 14:55.198
It's not our place to judge.

14:55.266 --> 14:58.501
Well, you do more than that,
right? You fuel interest in it?

14:58.569 --> 14:59.736
Not following.

14:59.804 --> 15:01.171
The photos online.

15:01.238 --> 15:02.798
We traced the I.P. address back to you.

15:02.799 --> 15:04.040
Oh, those. W...

15:04.108 --> 15:05.875
Well, they're good for business.

15:05.943 --> 15:07.844
Oh? So you get customers

15:07.912 --> 15:11.948
based on photos of dead animals
with scratched-up carcasses?

15:12.016 --> 15:13.416
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Imagine if

15:13.484 --> 15:14.717
there was an escalation

15:14.785 --> 15:17.087
from dead animal to dead human.

15:17.154 --> 15:18.954
- Attacked by a rougarou.
- Mm-hmm.

15:18.955 --> 15:21.057
What are you suggesting?
You think we killed him?

15:21.125 --> 15:23.445
That's not... We would never
do something like that. Never.

15:23.446 --> 15:25.166
Well, what would you
do if you found a body?

15:25.167 --> 15:26.382
If I found a body?

15:28.365 --> 15:30.867
Say that again. Say "I've found a body".

15:30.935 --> 15:33.369
- What?
- He's the one who called 911.

15:33.437 --> 15:34.871
Vincent, is that true?

15:34.939 --> 15:37.440
Oh, what if I did find it?

15:37.508 --> 15:39.709
Uh, calling 911 was
the decent thing to do.

15:39.777 --> 15:41.417
You didn't think to
mention that up front?

15:41.418 --> 15:44.314
- I didn't kill him.
- Well, then, what were you gonna...

15:44.381 --> 15:46.950
You were gonna post photos
of the mauled body online,

15:46.977 --> 15:48.577
you were gonna blame it on the rougarou.

15:48.578 --> 15:49.719
I took some pictures,

15:49.787 --> 15:51.821
but I didn't post 'em.
I realized it wasn't...

15:51.889 --> 15:53.089
Classy?

15:53.157 --> 15:54.324
I didn't kill him.

15:54.391 --> 15:55.425
He's not a killer,

15:55.492 --> 15:56.993
he's just an idiot.

15:58.195 --> 15:59.796
What aren't you telling us?

15:59.864 --> 16:00.864
Nothing, I...

16:01.899 --> 16:03.833
He came by one day last week.

16:03.901 --> 16:06.669
He was wanting to know
about the photos online,

16:06.737 --> 16:08.671
and he wanted to know
where they were shot.

16:08.739 --> 16:11.508
And I told him, couple miles upstream,

16:11.575 --> 16:14.077
and he said he was gonna
check out that area.

16:16.480 --> 16:17.914
I really appreciate this.

16:17.982 --> 16:19.282
Quentin says you're good people.

16:19.350 --> 16:20.590
But I don't have a lot of time.

16:20.611 --> 16:22.011
I've got to get back to the office.

16:22.012 --> 16:23.653
Okay, I'll get right to the point.

16:23.721 --> 16:27.323
You left NCIS after an incident
at your posting at Pearl Harbor.

16:27.391 --> 16:29.092
Counterintelligence
sting that went wrong?

16:29.160 --> 16:31.027
I can't get into those details.

16:31.095 --> 16:32.595
Okay, you don't have to.

16:32.663 --> 16:35.431
You just have to confirm that
Director Van Cleef demoted you.

16:35.499 --> 16:39.269
He didn't. I resigned before he could.

16:39.336 --> 16:41.971
Are you aware that Director Van Cleef

16:42.039 --> 16:43.973
is up for a promotion at DOD?

16:44.041 --> 16:46.142
No. No, when?

16:46.210 --> 16:48.278
As soon as he gets Senate confirmation.

16:48.345 --> 16:50.213
He's gonna be Chief of Naval Operations.

16:50.281 --> 16:51.447
Mommy?

16:51.515 --> 16:52.815
Oh, hey, Zoey, honey, uh,

16:52.883 --> 16:54.484
Mommy's doing something for work here.

16:55.152 --> 16:56.352
Have Amy

16:56.420 --> 16:57.555
fix you a snack, huh?

16:57.557 --> 16:59.291
- I'll be right there.
- Okay.

17:00.357 --> 17:01.524
Uh, sorry about that.

17:01.592 --> 17:03.726
No, no, no, it's okay. I, um...

17:03.794 --> 17:05.994
I was reviewing your
file from Pearl Harbor.

17:06.063 --> 17:09.332
It looks like you were building
a case against a hacker

17:09.400 --> 17:11.634
who broke into the base network,

17:11.662 --> 17:13.061
but you cut your key witness loose?

17:13.063 --> 17:15.538
I made a judgment call.

17:15.606 --> 17:19.175
I pulled a witness because
her story kept changing.

17:19.242 --> 17:20.577
Case fell apart.

17:20.644 --> 17:22.512
Van Cleef claimed I was responsible

17:22.579 --> 17:24.814
for not vetting the witness properly

17:24.882 --> 17:27.817
and for possibly falsifying

17:27.885 --> 17:29.219
statements.

17:29.286 --> 17:30.687
There was no point in fighting it,

17:30.754 --> 17:32.188
so I took early retirement.

17:32.256 --> 17:33.590
Did you ever feel like Van Cleef

17:33.657 --> 17:35.725
treated you differently
because you're a woman?

17:39.063 --> 17:41.397
When I, uh, I left NCIS,

17:41.465 --> 17:44.767
I moved into the private sector
as a security consultant.

17:44.835 --> 17:47.503
My firm has multiple contracts
with the government,

17:47.571 --> 17:50.373
most of which require DOD approval.

17:50.441 --> 17:52.308
It's a good living.

17:53.911 --> 17:57.280
Look, I know that coming forward
is high-risk and low-reward.

17:57.348 --> 17:58.715
I worry about my own career.

17:58.782 --> 18:01.084
But I also know that if people

18:01.151 --> 18:03.353
like you and me don't come forward,

18:03.420 --> 18:04.921
nothing will ever change.

18:04.989 --> 18:07.090
I have two daughters to support.

18:07.157 --> 18:10.193
I have a daughter, too.
And aren't you sick of it?

18:10.261 --> 18:12.301
Watching your mediocre
male colleagues just drift up

18:12.302 --> 18:15.231
the ladder with a slap on
the back and an attaboy?

18:15.299 --> 18:17.467
While people like you and
me work twice as hard

18:17.534 --> 18:19.202
just to stay in the game,

18:19.270 --> 18:21.604
and still get demoted and disciplined?

18:21.672 --> 18:24.407
Am I sick of swimming in a
sea of white male privilege?

18:24.475 --> 18:25.808
Of course I am.

18:25.876 --> 18:27.610
If Deputy Director Van Cleef gets DOD,

18:27.678 --> 18:29.812
how will things ever
change for our girls?

18:29.880 --> 18:33.750
It took me a long time to get
over what Van Cleef did to me.

18:33.817 --> 18:37.553
I'm a single mom. I've
made a good life for us.

18:37.621 --> 18:39.255
I'm not just gonna throw that away.

18:39.323 --> 18:40.890
I understand.

18:40.958 --> 18:42.992
Do you?

18:43.060 --> 18:44.627
Because I can't become another one

18:44.695 --> 18:47.063
of Van Cleef's casualties.

18:47.131 --> 18:49.565
I'm not gonna end up like Maya Caldwell.

18:49.633 --> 18:50.633
Who?

18:50.668 --> 18:54.137
Maya. The one who died.

18:57.408 --> 18:59.442
Agent Pride.

18:59.510 --> 19:01.477
Deputy Director Van Cleef.

19:01.545 --> 19:03.813
I apologize for not
doing this on the phone,

19:03.881 --> 19:05.615
but, as I'm sure you understand,

19:05.683 --> 19:07.784
certain things need to
be handled face-to-face.

19:07.851 --> 19:09.619
Of course. I didn't
know you were in town.

19:09.687 --> 19:11.287
I shouldn't be.

19:11.355 --> 19:13.690
I should be in D.C.
prepping for confirmation.

19:13.757 --> 19:15.124
I heard about your promotion.

19:15.192 --> 19:16.859
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

19:16.927 --> 19:19.462
Chief of Naval Operations. Big deal.

19:19.530 --> 19:21.331
I'll be a member of the Joint Chiefs,

19:21.398 --> 19:24.167
military advisor to the
National Security Council.

19:24.234 --> 19:27.203
Yes, sir, that's very prestigious.

19:27.271 --> 19:29.031
I've been working toward
a position like this

19:29.032 --> 19:30.139
for nearly four decades.

19:30.207 --> 19:32.675
And yet you're here with me.

19:32.743 --> 19:35.678
The only thing standing
between me and my future

19:35.746 --> 19:37.947
is a Senate confirmation hearing.

19:38.015 --> 19:40.983
And that was all but a
formality until yesterday.

19:41.051 --> 19:43.219
What happened yesterday?

19:43.287 --> 19:44.620
Hannah Khoury.

19:44.688 --> 19:46.556
Did you really think I wouldn't hear

19:46.623 --> 19:47.990
about what she's been doing?

19:48.058 --> 19:49.692
She never accepted her demotion.

19:49.760 --> 19:51.194
I'm not sure what you think...

19:51.261 --> 19:53.029
I'm not speculating. I know.

19:53.097 --> 19:54.297
I have eyes and ears

19:54.365 --> 19:56.032
everywhere at NCIS,

19:56.100 --> 19:58.460
and all the way up and down the
chain of command at the DOD.

19:58.461 --> 20:00.136
She's trying to find dirt on me.

20:00.204 --> 20:02.684
And this never would've happened
if she'd been put in her place

20:02.685 --> 20:03.806
like I wanted.

20:03.874 --> 20:06.642
Honestly, sir, this is news to me.

20:06.710 --> 20:08.478
Well, maybe she's
playing you for a fool.

20:08.545 --> 20:10.380
Or maybe you're in it together.

20:10.447 --> 20:11.967
But it doesn't matter. She's reckless,

20:11.982 --> 20:13.983
emotional, and out of control.

20:14.051 --> 20:18.388
Call her off, or hers won't be
the only career that she ends.

20:28.776 --> 20:30.910
Dwayne, I was just about to call you...

20:30.978 --> 20:32.112
Lab results?

20:32.179 --> 20:33.613
Animal hair found

20:33.681 --> 20:37.550
in the claw marks on the
body was from a bobcat.

20:37.618 --> 20:39.786
Sebastian was hoping for a rougarou.

20:39.854 --> 20:41.388
Let him down gently.

20:47.128 --> 20:49.062
One of those days?

20:49.130 --> 20:51.231
Yeah. That's an understatement.

20:51.298 --> 20:52.599
Just got my ass handed to me

20:52.666 --> 20:54.968
by Deputy Director Van Cleef.

20:55.036 --> 20:56.403
What's he upset about?

20:56.470 --> 20:57.670
I'm not quite sure yet.

20:57.738 --> 20:59.939
- He didn't tell you?
- I didn't ask.

21:00.007 --> 21:01.341
Okay.

21:01.409 --> 21:03.843
But I-I think it has something
to do with Hannah.

21:03.911 --> 21:06.479
But I haven't had a chance to
ask her because she's busy

21:06.547 --> 21:08.648
doing whatever it is that's
pissing Van Cleef off.

21:08.716 --> 21:10.116
I'm sure she had a good reason.

21:10.184 --> 21:12.519
And that's just one front I'm fighting.

21:12.586 --> 21:15.955
Linda's in town to do some
wedding planning for Laurel.

21:16.023 --> 21:17.357
I take it it's not going well.

21:17.425 --> 21:18.591
It was fine.

21:18.659 --> 21:22.128
At first. Awkward but pleasant.

21:22.196 --> 21:23.696
What happened?

21:23.764 --> 21:25.632
20 years of baggage.

21:25.699 --> 21:27.600
Sorry.

21:27.668 --> 21:29.369
We both moved on.

21:29.437 --> 21:32.639
We're both happy with the
people we're with, but...

21:32.706 --> 21:36.042
Sometimes when a wound
hasn't properly healed,

21:36.110 --> 21:38.678
it doesn't take much to
aggravate the injury.

21:38.746 --> 21:40.613
She said I abandoned her for the people

21:40.681 --> 21:43.283
I was trying to save on the job.

21:43.350 --> 21:44.484
Worst part is,

21:44.552 --> 21:46.886
she's not wrong.

21:46.954 --> 21:50.323
That's me in a nutshell.

21:50.391 --> 21:53.159
It takes a big man to
admit something like that.

21:53.227 --> 21:56.996
Oh, I-I didn't admit it to her.

21:57.064 --> 21:59.065
Everything that's happened in my life...

22:01.068 --> 22:04.204
...goes back to my
mother, Red and Cassius.

22:04.271 --> 22:07.207
Even the failure of my marriage.

22:07.274 --> 22:09.175
Those are powerful insights.

22:09.243 --> 22:11.277
Insights don't change the past.

22:15.816 --> 22:18.051
I'm sorry I didn't come to you first,

22:18.119 --> 22:20.400
- I'm sorry I kept you out of the loop.
- Don't apologize.

22:20.401 --> 22:22.255
But just please tell me what's going on.

22:22.323 --> 22:23.923
I don't know where to start.

22:23.991 --> 22:25.758
How about the beginning?

22:25.826 --> 22:28.261
You have a past with Van Cleef.

22:28.329 --> 22:31.931
You wouldn't tell me about
it before. But now...

22:35.596 --> 22:37.036
Seven years ago, there was an attack

22:37.037 --> 22:38.738
on our naval base in Bahrain.

22:38.806 --> 22:40.440
I was working counterterrorism.

22:40.508 --> 22:42.675
We tied the attack to
an ISIS cell in Algeria.

22:42.743 --> 22:44.410
I was sent to scoop them up,

22:44.478 --> 22:47.213
D.C. sent their man to supervise.

22:47.281 --> 22:48.515
Van Cleef?

22:48.582 --> 22:51.217
We clashed from the start.

22:51.285 --> 22:52.805
He didn't want to use local resources.

22:52.820 --> 22:54.754
Thought everyone was a double agent.

22:54.822 --> 22:56.956
Wanted a clean mission.

22:57.024 --> 22:59.526
But I was boots on the ground,
I knew there was no such thing,

22:59.593 --> 23:02.061
so I set up a network of informants.

23:02.129 --> 23:03.563
Only way to get intel.

23:03.631 --> 23:05.565
Yeah, I cultivated one
who was the real deal.

23:05.633 --> 23:07.767
Young man named Farid.

23:07.835 --> 23:09.269
He took some convincing.

23:09.336 --> 23:11.538
His wife didn't want
him to get involved.

23:11.605 --> 23:13.445
The intelligence he
provided led to the capture

23:13.446 --> 23:15.308
of the entire ISIS cell.

23:15.376 --> 23:16.976
- But...
- Somehow his identity

23:17.044 --> 23:19.245
was leaked t-to the Algerian press.

23:19.313 --> 23:22.315
The next day his face was
all over the newspapers,

23:22.383 --> 23:25.451
the... television.

23:25.519 --> 23:27.453
I guaranteed his safety.

23:27.521 --> 23:29.722
He was beaten to death in his own home,

23:29.750 --> 23:31.270
in front of his wife and his children.

23:31.271 --> 23:33.326
27 years old, just trying
to do the right thing.

23:33.394 --> 23:35.428
I didn't get to him in time.

23:35.496 --> 23:36.829
How was his identity leaked?

23:36.897 --> 23:38.498
Van Cleef accused me.

23:38.566 --> 23:41.206
I did everything by protocol. I don't
know how it could've been me.

23:41.207 --> 23:43.603
I-I asked him to launch an
investigation, but he wouldn't.

23:43.671 --> 23:45.071
So all the blame landed on you.

23:45.139 --> 23:46.906
Yeah, I was transferred and disciplined.

23:46.974 --> 23:48.340
That's painful.

23:48.342 --> 23:49.343
I'm sorry.

23:49.410 --> 23:51.344
But that was a long time ago.

23:51.412 --> 23:52.612
Why go after Van Cleef now?

23:52.680 --> 23:54.147
Something that Carter said

23:54.215 --> 23:56.082
when we found out Van
Cleef was going to DOD.

23:56.150 --> 23:57.830
He said that there was
another female agent

23:57.831 --> 23:59.752
who'd had a bad
experience with Van Cleef.

23:59.820 --> 24:02.255
That she got a raw deal, just like me.

24:02.323 --> 24:04.490
Something just clicked.

24:04.558 --> 24:09.495
I've been living with the guilt
of Farid's death for so long.

24:09.563 --> 24:11.698
I knew that Van Cleef
had a problem with me.

24:11.765 --> 24:14.534
I-I just never considered
it could be more than that.

24:14.602 --> 24:17.337
Who gave you access
to Van Cleef's files?

24:17.404 --> 24:20.206
Winchester. I tried to keep it quiet.

24:20.274 --> 24:22.008
Van Cleef knows what you're doing.

24:22.076 --> 24:25.378
I'm so sorry you got dragged into this.

24:25.446 --> 24:28.448
You got nothing to apologize to me for.

24:28.515 --> 24:30.650
But since I'm in,

24:30.718 --> 24:32.952
why don't you show me what you got?

24:34.788 --> 24:37.156
NOPD found Daniel Sloan's car,

24:37.224 --> 24:39.392
exactly where the swamp
tour dude said it would be.

24:39.460 --> 24:40.900
Yeah, he was out there myth-busting.

24:40.961 --> 24:42.721
There's another set of tire tracks.

24:42.722 --> 24:44.364
Yeah, two cars went
in, only one went out.

24:44.431 --> 24:46.399
We get any more
information on these tracks?

24:46.467 --> 24:50.370
Nothing useful. But I did find
a phone in Daniel Sloan's car.

24:50.437 --> 24:52.071
And what did you learn?

24:52.139 --> 24:53.906
He uses his birthday as his password.

24:53.974 --> 24:56.342
And he seems to have a girlfriend.

24:56.410 --> 24:58.044
Meet Stacy Ulrich.

24:58.105 --> 24:59.545
Wait, how did we not know about her?

24:59.546 --> 25:01.147
The texts only go back a few weeks.

25:01.215 --> 25:02.915
Seems like a new relationship.

25:02.983 --> 25:04.484
Sebastian, let's go talk to Stacy.

25:04.485 --> 25:05.552
Yeah.

25:06.153 --> 25:09.422
You definitely have the
data to back up your claims.

25:09.490 --> 25:11.658
He was disciplining female agents

25:11.725 --> 25:13.860
at almost five times the
rate as male agents.

25:13.928 --> 25:16.128
Yeah, and all of the women
had otherwise clean records.

25:16.129 --> 25:17.196
None of the men did.

25:17.264 --> 25:19.332
What I don't have is
human corroboration.

25:19.400 --> 25:21.167
What can I do to help?

25:21.235 --> 25:24.904
I don't know, this thing has
taken on a life of its own.

25:24.972 --> 25:26.439
There is one thing.

25:26.507 --> 25:29.075
There's a woman that I heard
about, a Maya Caldwell.

25:29.143 --> 25:32.445
She was on a mission with Van
Cleef out of Kuala Lumpur.

25:32.513 --> 25:33.880
I don't remember that name.

25:33.947 --> 25:35.515
It's not there.

25:35.582 --> 25:38.217
I don't have access to the
file. It's from ten years ago.

25:38.285 --> 25:40.325
Winchester only gave me
seven years' worth of files.

25:40.326 --> 25:42.055
Well, what do you know
about the mission?

25:42.122 --> 25:44.924
Nothing. It was classified.

25:44.992 --> 25:46.626
All I know is that Maya Caldwell

25:46.694 --> 25:48.861
died in a car crash

25:48.929 --> 25:51.698
less than a year after her
assignment with Van Cleef.

25:51.765 --> 25:53.900
And that her family lives in Atlanta.

25:53.967 --> 25:57.870
You think her death was
somehow connected to Van Cleef?

25:57.938 --> 26:00.807
Emily Landau sure does.

26:02.109 --> 26:04.310
Hannah, look, I'm here to support you.

26:04.378 --> 26:06.879
And I don't want to rush
in and try to save the day.

26:06.947 --> 26:08.414
I know you got this.

26:08.482 --> 26:11.884
So you tell me, what do you want to do?

26:11.952 --> 26:15.922
I need to know more about
how Maya Caldwell died.

26:15.989 --> 26:17.890
Then let's go to Atlanta.

26:17.958 --> 26:19.559
Okay.

26:28.240 --> 26:29.640
NCIS.

26:35.542 --> 26:36.843
Clear!

26:36.910 --> 26:38.311
Clear.

26:38.379 --> 26:39.912
She's not here.

26:39.980 --> 26:41.881
What the hell's going on here?

26:50.984 --> 26:52.984
_

26:54.030 --> 26:56.565
We were so close growing up.

26:56.632 --> 26:59.201
Sometimes it's hard to believe
that it's been almost ten years

26:59.268 --> 27:01.236
since my sister died.

27:01.304 --> 27:03.972
She never met my husband, my kids.

27:04.040 --> 27:05.907
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

27:05.975 --> 27:08.343
She was an amazing person, but...

27:08.411 --> 27:10.378
you're not here to listen
to me gush about Maya.

27:10.446 --> 27:13.715
I'm interested in her time at NCIS.

27:13.783 --> 27:15.317
Especially her last mission.

27:15.384 --> 27:17.886
- What do you know about it?
- Not much.

27:17.954 --> 27:21.089
She was in Kuala Lumpur for
about a year, and then home.

27:21.157 --> 27:22.757
Did she tell you what
she was working on?

27:22.825 --> 27:24.192
She never talked about work.

27:24.260 --> 27:25.861
And most of it was classified.

27:25.928 --> 27:27.896
That was one of the hardest things,

27:27.964 --> 27:29.698
especially after she came home.

27:29.765 --> 27:31.266
She couldn't talk about any of it.

27:31.334 --> 27:33.902
Maya really needed to talk to someone.

27:33.970 --> 27:35.337
Did she ever say anything

27:35.404 --> 27:37.672
about a supervisor named Van Cleef?

27:37.740 --> 27:40.075
Ah, yeah.

27:40.142 --> 27:41.743
That name I heard a lot.

27:41.811 --> 27:43.111
Uh, nothing specific,

27:43.179 --> 27:44.346
but...

27:44.413 --> 27:46.214
I could tell he'd done something to her.

27:46.282 --> 27:48.116
- Done something?
- He was the reason

27:48.184 --> 27:49.351
she left NCIS.

27:49.418 --> 27:50.886
- She said that?
- Yeah.

27:50.953 --> 27:52.187
Whatever happened there,

27:52.255 --> 27:53.521
it was the beginning

27:53.589 --> 27:55.190
of the end for her.

27:55.258 --> 27:57.425
What was her transition
like to the private sector?

27:57.493 --> 27:59.427
There wasn't one. She
took some time off,

27:59.495 --> 28:01.263
tried to transition into teaching.

28:01.330 --> 28:02.764
- Teaching?
- She said

28:02.832 --> 28:04.299
teaching was all she could do.

28:04.367 --> 28:05.700
She knew seven languages.

28:05.768 --> 28:07.803
She didn't look for security positions?

28:07.871 --> 28:10.105
With her background and
experience, she should have had

28:10.106 --> 28:11.340
her pick of consulting jobs.

28:11.374 --> 28:13.174
She just said she couldn't
work in that field.

28:13.175 --> 28:14.276
No one would hire her.

28:14.343 --> 28:16.645
Van Cleef may have gotten
her clearance revoked.

28:18.147 --> 28:21.082
She never said that,
but it explains a lot.

28:21.150 --> 28:24.219
She kept saying that
man ruined her future.

28:26.289 --> 28:28.056
I think she was depressed.

28:28.124 --> 28:29.457
I know she was self-medicating.

28:29.525 --> 28:31.960
First alcohol, then pills.

28:32.028 --> 28:34.062
Before, Maya was...

28:34.130 --> 28:36.898
she was a force of nature.

28:36.966 --> 28:41.169
Confident, funny, generous.

28:41.197 --> 28:42.757
Sounds like she was a great big sister.

28:42.758 --> 28:44.239
Yeah, the best.

28:44.307 --> 28:48.076
But when she came home,
she was smaller, somehow.

28:48.144 --> 28:49.444
She f-folded in

28:49.512 --> 28:51.012
on herself.

28:51.080 --> 28:53.248
Van Cleef wasn't in Maya's
car the night she wrapped it

28:53.316 --> 28:55.850
around that tree, but he
might as well have been.

28:57.720 --> 29:00.188
As far as I'm concerned,
he's the reason she's dead.

29:03.893 --> 29:05.460
Okay, thanks. Yep.

29:05.528 --> 29:09.130
So, Carter, uh, found a
neighbor who heard screaming

29:09.198 --> 29:11.299
and a loud male voice
coming from Stacy's house.

29:11.367 --> 29:13.168
Oh. How neighborly not to call the cops.

29:13.235 --> 29:15.503
I guess Stacy was
abducted from her house.

29:15.571 --> 29:17.272
Listen, we need to rethink this.

29:17.340 --> 29:19.674
Whoever abducted
Stacy killed Daniel, too,

29:19.742 --> 29:21.109
so who are we looking for?

29:21.177 --> 29:22.610
What's the motive?

29:22.678 --> 29:24.398
Well, I mean, I'm-I'm
just spitballing here,

29:24.399 --> 29:26.114
but maybe it's a-a romantic rival?

29:26.182 --> 29:28.702
Well, that would explain killing
Daniel and keeping Stacy alive.

29:28.769 --> 29:29.769
If she is still alive.

29:29.837 --> 29:32.020
I think she is, but who
knows for how long.

29:32.088 --> 29:33.655
I got something.

29:33.723 --> 29:35.523
- But it's dark.
- Let's hear it.

29:35.591 --> 29:37.726
I was looking for any
kind of online footprint

29:37.793 --> 29:40.662
that would include Daniel
Sloan and Stacy Ulrich.

29:40.730 --> 29:42.564
Now, aside from the
dating app they met on,

29:42.631 --> 29:44.232
I found a site on the darknet

29:44.300 --> 29:45.900
that mentioned them both by name.

29:46.101 --> 29:47.401
_

29:47.403 --> 29:49.070
Well, who posted it?

29:49.138 --> 29:50.805
Well, it's anonymous.

29:50.873 --> 29:52.833
But it's a website where
the participant can write

29:52.834 --> 29:54.909
their murder/rape/whatever fantasy.

29:54.977 --> 29:56.544
He wrote a fantasy about having sex

29:56.612 --> 29:58.680
with Stacy in the
aftermath of the murder

29:58.748 --> 30:00.915
of her previous boyfriend Daniel Sloan.

30:00.983 --> 30:02.423
People write stuff like this online?

30:02.485 --> 30:04.925
Of course, Sebastian. There's
a lot of twisted crap out there.

30:04.926 --> 30:06.521
They get off on having an audience.

30:06.589 --> 30:08.723
They feel safely hidden
behind firewalls.

30:08.791 --> 30:10.658
This is a major firewall.

30:10.726 --> 30:13.228
Okay. So maybe this is a-a stalker

30:13.296 --> 30:15.296
who thought that Daniel
Sloan was his only obstacle

30:15.297 --> 30:17.165
- to getting what he wanted?
- Right.

30:17.233 --> 30:20.168
So he shows up at her
house, she's not smitten.

30:20.236 --> 30:22.871
Nothing's going
according to the fantasy.

30:22.938 --> 30:24.773
He has to abduct her to get her to go

30:24.840 --> 30:26.674
wherever he wants her to go.

30:26.742 --> 30:29.177
That would infuriate him,
and if that's the case,

30:29.245 --> 30:31.246
he'd start to decompensate,

30:31.313 --> 30:34.883
meaning he'd become more
delusional, more erratic,

30:34.950 --> 30:36.051
more violent.

30:36.118 --> 30:37.358
I need that I.P. address, fast.

30:37.426 --> 30:38.546
I'm looking for a back door.

30:38.547 --> 30:39.587
I'm in.

30:39.615 --> 30:40.735
I.P. address is an apartment

30:40.736 --> 30:42.924
leased to a Kevin McCabe.

30:42.992 --> 30:44.672
That's the lab tech who
worked with Daniel.

30:44.673 --> 30:46.540
All right, send it to my GPS.

30:50.332 --> 30:51.800
Federal agents!

30:51.867 --> 30:52.901
Kevin McCabe,

30:52.968 --> 30:54.436
put your hands up.

30:54.503 --> 30:56.204
Come on, Kevin, you
don't want to do that.

30:56.272 --> 30:57.439
Let her go.

30:57.506 --> 30:58.573
I had to tie her up.

30:58.641 --> 31:00.708
She wasn't being nice to me!

31:00.776 --> 31:02.277
Because you're scaring her.

31:03.479 --> 31:05.080
She's afraid of you.

31:05.147 --> 31:07.715
If it wasn't for Dan,

31:07.783 --> 31:08.883
we could've been together.

31:08.951 --> 31:10.318
I had to get rid of him.

31:10.386 --> 31:13.455
But Stacy just needs some time.

31:13.522 --> 31:14.656
Right, Stacy?

31:16.525 --> 31:18.560
You just need a little time.

31:18.627 --> 31:20.128
No...

31:20.196 --> 31:22.063
See?

31:22.131 --> 31:24.499
She wants it to work
between the two of you.

31:29.205 --> 31:30.338
She does?

31:30.406 --> 31:31.506
Yeah.

31:33.042 --> 31:34.676
Look at her face. She's not lying.

31:43.419 --> 31:45.720
It's over. Okay?

31:46.555 --> 31:47.555
Yeah.

31:49.425 --> 31:50.892
You're gonna be okay. All right?

31:51.894 --> 31:52.994
You lied to me.

31:53.062 --> 31:56.364
Yeah. I did.

31:56.432 --> 31:59.000
Not bad for a day's work.

31:59.068 --> 32:01.603
Yeah. You know, you were
really impressive up there.

32:01.670 --> 32:03.671
Zoned right in on his pathology.

32:03.739 --> 32:05.607
- Saved two lives.
- Thanks.

32:05.674 --> 32:07.976
- Not too shabby yourself.
- Thank you.

32:08.043 --> 32:10.478
Though I got to say
this case has really just

32:10.546 --> 32:12.180
killed my interest in the rougarou.

32:12.248 --> 32:13.815
Good.

32:13.883 --> 32:16.551
What, are you taking joy
in my shattered illusion?

32:16.619 --> 32:17.886
No, I'm not taking joy in it.

32:17.953 --> 32:19.621
I'm just happy you're
ditching the idiocy.

32:19.628 --> 32:20.662
Idiocy?

32:20.689 --> 32:21.849
I call it like I see it, bro.

32:21.891 --> 32:23.925
You know what, maybe I won't give it up.

32:23.993 --> 32:25.026
Oh, here we go.

32:25.094 --> 32:26.227
I mean, these creatures,

32:26.295 --> 32:27.729
mythical or not, they, uh...

32:27.796 --> 32:29.164
they make the world interesting.

32:29.231 --> 32:31.151
So, basically, this case
reinforced your pathetic

32:31.152 --> 32:33.535
fascination with a
stupid swamp creature?

32:33.602 --> 32:36.638
No, actually you did back there when...

32:36.705 --> 32:38.173
Wait a minute.

32:38.240 --> 32:39.841
- What?
- I know what you just did.

32:39.909 --> 32:41.242
You reverse-psychology'd me.

32:41.310 --> 32:42.630
- Oh, get out of here.
- No. Yeah.

32:42.631 --> 32:44.271
You said something was
stupid and pathetic

32:44.272 --> 32:45.647
to get my hackles up.

32:45.714 --> 32:47.274
Because you knew how I was gonna react.

32:47.275 --> 32:48.275
You're crazy. I did not.

32:48.317 --> 32:49.350
Yeah, you did.

32:49.418 --> 32:50.985
Hey, knock it off.

32:51.053 --> 32:52.613
- You know what, Tammy Gregorio?
- What?

32:52.614 --> 32:54.255
You may have this prickly exterior,

32:54.323 --> 32:56.057
but I see your soft and creamy center.

32:56.125 --> 32:58.226
You're disgusting.

32:58.228 --> 33:00.028
It was not the right
choice of words, I agree.

33:00.029 --> 33:01.829
- You want a creamy pop?
- What are you doing?

33:01.830 --> 33:03.064
Why are you coming over here?

33:03.131 --> 33:04.632
Leave me alone. I'm a federal agent!

33:06.402 --> 33:08.503
How'd it go in Atlanta?

33:08.571 --> 33:09.737
It was sad.

33:09.805 --> 33:11.406
The sister couldn't help?

33:11.473 --> 33:13.274
No.

33:13.342 --> 33:15.877
None of the women who
Van Cleef screwed over

33:15.945 --> 33:17.245
wanted to come forward, so...

33:17.313 --> 33:18.913
I don't know. Maybe I'm in over my head.

33:18.914 --> 33:20.915
Maybe I should just let it go.

33:20.983 --> 33:22.784
I don't think so.

33:22.851 --> 33:24.953
There's something I need to tell you

33:25.020 --> 33:26.754
about your mission in Algeria.

33:28.424 --> 33:29.591
How'd you know about that?

33:29.658 --> 33:30.692
I read the file.

33:30.760 --> 33:32.201
Well, I don't need to read the file,

33:32.202 --> 33:33.286
- I lived it.
- Fair enough.

33:33.295 --> 33:35.096
But I did need to read it.

33:35.164 --> 33:38.233
And I know about the informant
who got exposed, his death.

33:38.300 --> 33:40.568
And that Van Cleef submitted
a report blaming you

33:40.636 --> 33:42.070
for the whole fiasco.

33:42.137 --> 33:43.438
The thing is,

33:43.505 --> 33:45.306
he wrongly blamed you for it.

33:45.374 --> 33:46.741
Well, it was complicated.

33:46.809 --> 33:48.142
No, not really.

33:48.210 --> 33:50.111
What did you find?

33:50.179 --> 33:52.547
A photo of your informant was
leaked to the Algerian press.

33:52.615 --> 33:53.715
I tracked the photo down.

33:53.782 --> 33:55.316
- Why?
- 'Cause I wanted to figure out

33:55.384 --> 33:56.751
how it got leaked.

33:56.819 --> 33:59.654
It was an official NCIS informant photo.

33:59.722 --> 34:01.122
It was hacked from someone's phone.

34:01.123 --> 34:03.443
They never figured out who,
Van Cleef was sure it was mine.

34:03.444 --> 34:06.661
Yeah, well, they didn't have
Patton Plame on the payroll.

34:06.729 --> 34:08.728
Don't tell me that you got
Patton involved in this.

34:08.731 --> 34:09.764
He wouldn't shut up

34:09.831 --> 34:12.000
until I agreed to let him help.

34:12.067 --> 34:14.469
He dug into the metadata
found in the JPEG image,

34:14.536 --> 34:16.103
tracked it back to the cell phone

34:16.170 --> 34:17.639
from where it was hacked.

34:17.706 --> 34:19.274
It wasn't your phone, Hannah.

34:19.341 --> 34:21.109
It was Van Cleef's.

34:21.176 --> 34:23.645
- Are you sure about this?
- Yeah.

34:23.712 --> 34:25.313
He threw you under the bus to cover

34:25.380 --> 34:26.748
for his own security breach.

34:26.815 --> 34:29.117
- You can prove this?
- Yeah.

34:29.184 --> 34:31.063
Patton and I will stand up
behind whatever it is

34:31.065 --> 34:32.299
you want to do with this.

34:35.024 --> 34:38.426
So... what's it gonna be?

34:39.893 --> 34:41.829
I'm gonna go public.

34:51.237 --> 34:53.705
I'm heading back to D.C. in two hours.

34:53.773 --> 34:56.608
I need to know that you've got
this Khouri mess under control.

34:56.676 --> 34:57.796
Oh, it's taken care of, sir.

34:57.797 --> 34:59.911
I hope you're not just
placating me, Pride.

34:59.979 --> 35:03.015
And that you understand
the severity of the situation.

35:03.082 --> 35:04.549
My Senate hearing is on the calendar

35:04.617 --> 35:05.851
for the end of the month.

35:05.918 --> 35:09.287
If Special Agent Khoury is
within a hundred-mile radius

35:09.355 --> 35:10.689
of D.C. at that time...

35:10.757 --> 35:14.059
Please go on. What will you do?

35:14.127 --> 35:16.028
What the hell is she doing here?

35:16.095 --> 35:17.963
Don't talk to him. You can talk to me.

35:18.031 --> 35:20.032
What happens if I go anywhere near D.C.?

35:20.099 --> 35:21.867
You arrange this?

35:21.894 --> 35:23.094
You'll ruin my career?

35:23.095 --> 35:24.903
Have my clearance revoked?

35:24.971 --> 35:26.171
Frame me for a leak?

35:26.239 --> 35:28.159
Damn it, Pride, I told you
to rein this woman in.

35:28.160 --> 35:29.574
This woman has a mind of her own.

35:29.642 --> 35:31.882
I've already notified the Senate
Armed Services committee

35:31.883 --> 35:34.746
that I'm going to testify at
your confirmation hearing.

35:34.814 --> 35:38.083
So I guess I will see you in D.C.

35:38.151 --> 35:40.052
You'll be committing career suicide.

35:40.119 --> 35:42.054
- Both of you.
- No. We're doing the right thing.

35:42.121 --> 35:44.356
It's you who's committing
career suicide.

35:45.458 --> 35:47.626
I know about Algeria.

35:47.694 --> 35:50.128
I know that the leak
that killed Farid Mokrani

35:50.196 --> 35:51.530
came from your phone, not mine.

35:51.597 --> 35:54.599
- And I can prove it.
- You'll look like a vindictive shrew.

35:54.667 --> 35:56.802
I can show patterns of gender bias

35:56.869 --> 35:59.438
in missions that you
led going back years.

35:59.505 --> 36:01.907
Patterns in the way that
you disciplined, demoted,

36:01.974 --> 36:03.475
and fired female agents.

36:03.543 --> 36:05.544
You don't have access to
that kind of intelligence.

36:05.545 --> 36:09.781
Algeria, Seoul, Naples,
Romania, Manila, Pearl Harbor.

36:09.849 --> 36:11.009
Who have you been talking to?

36:11.017 --> 36:13.018
It's all true, and I can prove it.

36:13.086 --> 36:14.886
You think you're gonna
come out of this clean?

36:14.887 --> 36:16.588
Your record will be scrutinized.

36:16.656 --> 36:17.789
Picked apart.

36:17.857 --> 36:19.524
- They'll crucify you.
- Maybe.

36:19.592 --> 36:21.512
But maybe I'll be the one
to open the floodgates,

36:21.513 --> 36:24.429
and they can't crucify all of us.

36:24.497 --> 36:27.032
I'm willing to bet on
myself. How about you?

36:27.100 --> 36:29.835
- What do you expect me to do?
- Resign.

36:29.902 --> 36:32.204
Take a job in the private sector.

36:38.611 --> 36:41.179
I blame you for this.

36:51.624 --> 36:56.161
You are the fiercest field
agent I have ever known.

36:56.229 --> 36:58.230
I wish I was a fly on that wall, though.

36:58.297 --> 36:59.865
True. I got to say I'm impressed.

36:59.933 --> 37:01.466
I don't know, guys, I keep waiting for

37:01.467 --> 37:03.267
the director to call me
and tell me I'm fired.

37:03.269 --> 37:05.629
Oh, please, they can't fire you
for speaking truth to power.

37:05.697 --> 37:06.897
Actually, I'm pretty sure

37:06.898 --> 37:08.006
they do that all the time.

37:08.074 --> 37:09.394
Yeah, well, not this time.

37:09.442 --> 37:11.042
Just got off the phone
with the director.

37:11.043 --> 37:12.177
God.

37:12.245 --> 37:14.312
No, it's all good.

37:14.380 --> 37:16.314
Van Cleef submitted his resignation,

37:16.382 --> 37:18.016
effective immediately.

37:18.084 --> 37:20.986
What? Because of what we did?

37:21.053 --> 37:22.187
What you did.

37:22.255 --> 37:24.055
You made yourself heard.

37:24.123 --> 37:26.591
You gave other agents a voice.

37:26.659 --> 37:29.027
Maybe this is just the beginning.

37:29.095 --> 37:31.429
I can't believe it.

37:31.497 --> 37:32.864
Thank you.

37:32.932 --> 37:34.599
I was just along for the ride.

37:34.667 --> 37:35.867
You did all the heavy lifting.

37:35.868 --> 37:36.868
All of you.

37:36.903 --> 37:38.236
Thank you so much.

37:38.304 --> 37:40.072
I asked, and you guys were both there.

37:40.139 --> 37:41.173
Oh, stop.

37:41.220 --> 37:42.340
Let's not get all sappy now.

37:42.341 --> 37:43.581
We've got too much to celebrate

37:43.609 --> 37:45.209
to be sitting in this kitchen, drinking.

37:45.244 --> 37:46.578
Can we go to the bar, please?

37:46.646 --> 37:47.679
You go ahead.

37:47.747 --> 37:49.414
- Laurel's coming in tonight.
- Okay.

37:49.442 --> 37:51.042
I got some things I need to take care of

37:51.043 --> 37:52.310
before she gets here.

37:54.153 --> 37:56.555
You made a difference.

37:56.622 --> 37:57.856
Thanks.

37:58.858 --> 38:00.992
All right, come on, let's
go. What are we doing?

38:00.993 --> 38:03.153
All right, I'm wiped. One
drink but only if I'm buying.

38:03.154 --> 38:04.688
No argument from me. Carter?

38:06.165 --> 38:07.199
Mm...

38:07.267 --> 38:09.067
Oh, come on. I'm not
taking no for an answer.

38:09.068 --> 38:10.068
Get your ass to the bar

38:10.136 --> 38:11.816
and let me buy you
that thank-you cocktail.

38:11.817 --> 38:13.885
Okay, okay, just this one time.

38:13.886 --> 38:15.386
Wow. Please.

38:18.277 --> 38:19.811
Dwayne.

38:21.647 --> 38:23.715
Thank you for seeing me.

38:25.351 --> 38:28.386
Um, I've been thinking
about what you said.

38:28.414 --> 38:29.894
No, I don't think we should go there.

38:29.895 --> 38:31.790
I just want to say one thing.

38:31.858 --> 38:32.924
You say one thing,

38:32.992 --> 38:34.326
then I say something back,

38:34.393 --> 38:36.094
- and then we're...
- Linda, damn it.

38:37.730 --> 38:38.897
Will you let me talk?

38:38.965 --> 38:40.799
Please?

38:51.043 --> 38:54.846
All I'm trying to say is...

38:54.914 --> 38:58.483
I'm sorry. You were right.

39:01.554 --> 39:02.954
I didn't expect that.

39:03.022 --> 39:05.957
I've learned some things
about myself recently,

39:06.025 --> 39:09.127
about my past, why I do
some of the things that I do.

39:09.195 --> 39:12.664
What you said about me
needing to rescue people,

39:12.732 --> 39:16.301
be a hero... it's true.

39:16.369 --> 39:18.303
But until you said it,

39:18.371 --> 39:22.340
I hadn't thought about
how it had affected you.

39:22.408 --> 39:25.610
You never needed me to rescue you.

39:27.013 --> 39:28.780
No, I didn't.

39:28.848 --> 39:33.618
I did the best that I knew
how to do at the time.

39:33.686 --> 39:35.320
It just wasn't enough.

39:35.388 --> 39:37.155
Not for us.

39:37.223 --> 39:38.723
Dwayne,

39:38.791 --> 39:40.091
I...

39:41.794 --> 39:43.795
Thank you.

39:49.235 --> 39:50.302
Okay.

39:50.369 --> 39:52.137
Uh...

39:55.808 --> 39:58.810
You want to grab a drink at the
Carousel Bar, or you want...?

39:58.878 --> 40:01.012
You know, maybe we, um...

40:01.080 --> 40:03.214
we just quit while we're ahead.

40:17.663 --> 40:19.431
What are you doing here?

40:19.498 --> 40:21.499
You think you're gonna win, don't you?

40:21.567 --> 40:24.169
Gonna prove some kind of point. Right?

40:24.236 --> 40:26.104
Look, honestly, you need to leave.

40:26.172 --> 40:28.740
No matter how many of you
crawl out of the woodwork

40:28.808 --> 40:30.375
to claw at me,

40:30.443 --> 40:32.410
it won't make any difference.

40:32.478 --> 40:33.798
Because I've spent too many years

40:33.846 --> 40:35.914
working my way up the ladder.

40:35.982 --> 40:38.416
I know you think you're
a very important man,

40:38.484 --> 40:41.219
and I understand that.

40:41.287 --> 40:45.957
But right now you're a
trespasser on my property.

40:46.025 --> 40:47.759
And you have two options.

40:47.827 --> 40:50.395
You can leave, or I will call the cops

40:50.463 --> 40:53.264
and have them remove you.

40:53.332 --> 40:56.601
Please choose the second option.
