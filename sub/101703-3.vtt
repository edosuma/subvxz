WEBVTT

06:43.027 --> 06:44.278
Bastards.

07:56.684 --> 08:00.313
Hey, you,
what happened to Fortress Germany?

08:00.938 --> 08:02.732
Where the hell've you been?

08:03.608 --> 08:04.609
Finland.

08:06.736 --> 08:07.904
Fighting the Russians.

08:11.449 --> 08:12.742
Allied bombers.

08:13.951 --> 08:16.662
Apparently,
"Fortress Germany" has great walls,

08:17.163 --> 08:18.498
but no roof.

08:32.553 --> 08:34.931
Lieutenant Voss, 11th GebirgsjÃ¤ger.

08:35.598 --> 08:39.769
Welcome home, Voss. I am told
you are familiar with the Vosges?

08:40.603 --> 08:44.357
Yes, sir.
My grandparents had a home in Pirmasens.

08:45.066 --> 08:47.527
Well,
the Americans are in their front yard.

08:48.236 --> 08:50.988
It is your job to keep them
from entering the house.

18:13.258 --> 18:15.928
Henrich. Get ready.

26:13.780 --> 26:14.781
Home?

26:18.577 --> 26:19.661
My girlfriend.

26:21.162 --> 26:23.790
She is working in a hospital in Frankfurt.

26:26.459 --> 26:28.712
They are being bombed day and night.

26:29.588 --> 26:32.799
I had a leave a month ago.

26:34.676 --> 26:37.429
I was going home to see my parents.

26:43.852 --> 26:47.022
One week before I was to leave,
their block was bombed.

26:49.482 --> 26:50.734
Killed them both.

26:54.529 --> 26:57.282
This wasn't the world I envisioned
four years ago.

27:05.206 --> 27:06.791
None of us did.

32:14.140 --> 32:15.475
It's an officer.

33:06.109 --> 33:07.068
Wait.

34:14.510 --> 34:16.054
Why didn't we shoot?

34:19.057 --> 34:20.266
Because we had a choice.

43:30.482 --> 43:31.400
My God.
