WEBVTT

00:35.833 --> 00:40.125
TO NICK AND SAMUEL, WHO HAVE
TAUGHT ME ABOUT FILM AND SOUND

00:43.916 --> 00:48.916
NEW MOTOR-RAIL TRAINS WITH SLEEPING BERTHS

00:49.000 --> 00:53.791
PARIS TO MONT-BLANC PARIS TO NICE

01:20.000 --> 01:21.458
"Take happiness. for example…

01:24.333 --> 01:26.541
If he was looking for something,

01:28.500 --> 01:29.833
I was, too.

01:33.208 --> 01:37.500
Even honor, for him.

01:41.958 --> 01:44.000
If he had no desire,

01:45.416 --> 01:46.541
neither did I.

01:49.333 --> 01:55.166
So I gave up my desires, for him.

01:59.375 --> 02:00.791
When he was silent,

02:02.625 --> 02:04.583
he was like me.

02:07.583 --> 02:10.625
My only desires were his."

02:17.458 --> 02:21.458
-Where do I leave the whisky?
-There.

02:24.500 --> 02:27.833
-Do you want new towels?
-Yes, please.

02:53.916 --> 02:57.625
-What's the population of Atlantic City?
-63,000.

02:57.708 --> 03:00.166
Maybe more than 62,500.

03:03.250 --> 03:07.833
There was a heavy police crackdown
on motorists last weekend.

03:07.916 --> 03:10.083
In Paris too.

03:10.166 --> 03:16.166
Wasn't the Communist Party
defeated here last year?

03:16.250 --> 03:19.291
Seems they were going to requisition
all the bathrooms.

03:24.625 --> 03:25.833
Thanks.

03:58.583 --> 04:01.416
Still just as beautiful, Miss Nelson.

04:03.083 --> 04:05.583
What are you doing here?

04:05.666 --> 04:08.416
-What do you want?
-To talk with you.

04:08.500 --> 04:09.500
What?

04:09.583 --> 04:11.291
Not here in the corridor.

04:32.125 --> 04:36.291
So, you want to talk? Go ahead.

04:36.375 --> 04:39.208
The war in Morocco made you cruel.

04:41.125 --> 04:45.166
You know, the war ended for me long ago.

04:48.250 --> 04:51.583
Yes, it's well over.

04:52.291 --> 04:57.083
It's never over! Trafalgar, Sedan,
Le Chemin des Dames,

04:57.166 --> 05:02.041
Mers el-Kebir, Leningrad,
Okinawa, Berlin, Hanoi.

05:02.125 --> 05:06.375
The names change but it's the same.
The proof!

05:06.458 --> 05:07.625
What proof?

05:09.583 --> 05:14.125
-What are you doing here anyway?
-You're a jerk!

05:18.750 --> 05:20.166
A real jerk.

05:25.416 --> 05:29.125
So, what do you have to tell me?

05:30.291 --> 05:31.250
Eh…

05:46.375 --> 05:48.416
How did Richard die?

05:49.625 --> 05:51.333
Was it really a heart attack?

05:52.666 --> 05:56.583
How should I know?
I read it in the newspaper.

05:56.666 --> 06:01.166
-And I came immediately.
-Immediately, right!

06:02.708 --> 06:05.916
-You weren't there when it happened?
-Why me?

06:06.000 --> 06:12.125
Mr Typhus, if you want to talk to me,
you'd better get on with it.

06:12.208 --> 06:15.583
I rushed here this morning,
without even unpacking.

06:18.416 --> 06:24.250
I got off the train at 8:13.
And I walked here from the station.

06:24.333 --> 06:28.791
I crossed the street
and saw you entering the hotel.

06:28.875 --> 06:33.083
I asked for your room number,
took one next to it

06:33.166 --> 06:35.750
and came straight to talk to you.

06:35.833 --> 06:39.416
Why can't we work together?

06:39.500 --> 06:43.083
-We have in the past!
-Not with me.

06:43.750 --> 06:48.375
With Dick, maybe. Work at what anyway?

06:53.375 --> 06:56.666
-Work at what?
-We're both looking for the same thing.

06:56.750 --> 07:00.500
Oh, really?
And what is it we're looking for?

07:01.541 --> 07:03.541
You know very well, Paula.

07:03.625 --> 07:08.916
You're just trying to find out
if I know more than you.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.291
More about what?
You're getting on my nerves.

07:13.083 --> 07:17.416
I got the telegram three days ago.
I was only able to come yesterday.

07:18.541 --> 07:20.333
We hardly saw each other anymore.

07:21.791 --> 07:24.375
I don't know if I even still love him.

07:25.833 --> 07:28.708
But I owed him something
because of that love.

07:30.541 --> 07:36.500
I was told he had been taken
to the hospital of the 5th district.

07:36.583 --> 07:42.416
I thought the newspaper said
he had been buried already.

07:42.500 --> 07:46.083
I don't know.
They didn't tell me anything.

07:47.416 --> 07:50.500
Now tell me something
that I don't already know.

07:52.458 --> 07:55.166
You know very well that it's a secret.

07:55.750 --> 07:59.666
-What secret?
-Don't start playing games.

07:59.750 --> 08:03.750
Never mind, I can do it myself.

08:10.375 --> 08:15.625
You know, there must
be some scared people in Paris.

08:15.708 --> 08:20.541
The Information Bureau,
and maybe even the government itself.

08:20.625 --> 08:23.625
You think the situation is serious?

08:25.916 --> 08:29.375
Yes, it's serious. Extremely serious.

08:32.041 --> 08:36.541
If we work together,
will we share the benefits?

08:36.625 --> 08:40.250
Yes, alright. OK.

08:43.791 --> 08:46.833
Which shoes go better with my dress?

08:47.583 --> 08:49.916
-Blue or white?
-The blue ones.

08:59.958 --> 09:02.791
<i>Already fiction wins over reality.</i>

09:03.833 --> 09:05.875
<i>Already there's blood and mystery.</i>

09:07.750 --> 09:11.375
<i>Already I feel like I'm in a Disney movie,</i>

09:11.458 --> 09:16.166
<i>but one starring Humphrey Bogart,</i>
<i>is therefore in a political movie.</i>

10:33.041 --> 10:37.000
DOCTOR KORVO IS THE CORONER

10:37.083 --> 10:41.708
What have you done to Uncle Edgar?
What have you done to Uncle Edgar?

10:41.791 --> 10:43.958
-Are you his nephew?
-Yes, madam.

10:47.833 --> 10:50.166
-Don't mind me.
-Is he dead?

10:50.708 --> 10:51.625
No.

11:05.458 --> 11:07.791
I am the one he wanted to talk to.

11:09.583 --> 11:12.416
-Are you going to tell the police?
-I won't say a thing.

11:13.875 --> 11:17.041
-What's your name?
-David Goodis.

11:25.500 --> 11:29.208
-And who's this girl?
-The girl I love.

11:31.750 --> 11:34.125
Doris Misoguchi.

11:39.250 --> 11:42.916
We were on holiday in Paris.
Uncle Edgar invited us.

11:51.291 --> 11:53.708
How long were you in Paris for?

11:53.791 --> 11:56.833
-Exactly?
-Yes, exactly.

12:41.375 --> 12:43.958
-How long were you there?
-Exactly?

12:44.041 --> 12:45.625
Exactly?

12:46.166 --> 12:47.916
Exactly…

12:51.541 --> 12:55.625
-127 years.
-Really? That's what I thought.

12:55.708 --> 12:58.708
You mustn't have seen her often
during that time.

12:58.791 --> 13:03.375
Hardly ever, she lived too far away.
I'd see her only everyday.

13:03.458 --> 13:08.166
For breakfast, lunch, tea,

13:08.250 --> 13:10.208
sometimes before dinner,

13:10.291 --> 13:12.958
and we went to the cinema after dinner.

13:13.583 --> 13:18.125
She couldn't come more often, because
she lived too far away, in Levallois.

13:19.166 --> 13:22.583
Since Levallois isn't Paris,
and Paris isn't France,

13:22.666 --> 13:26.083
she had to get a visa
every time she came to see me.

13:26.166 --> 13:28.958
Couldn't you go to see her?

13:29.666 --> 13:35.000
Yes, but only outside breakfast,
lunch, tea and dinner.

13:36.541 --> 13:38.708
You really are an idiot.

13:41.625 --> 13:44.291
If I were an idiot,
I wouldn't speak French.

13:48.625 --> 13:51.541
What are you in Atlantic City for?

13:56.750 --> 13:59.875
"I'm trapped alive in this mirror.

13:59.958 --> 14:04.625
I'm real, like an angel,
and not like reflections."

14:07.791 --> 14:09.333
What are you writing?

14:10.416 --> 14:14.083
A novel that will never end.
I'll call it<i>The unfinished novel</i>.

14:26.416 --> 14:33.000
"Who's the actress with deep eyes,
black like a bouquet?

14:34.500 --> 14:38.833
That Japanese girl
suddenly has something of a Manet.

14:40.208 --> 14:44.625
Maybe, like me, she is
just tired of their conversations.

14:45.666 --> 14:48.500
But the girl just uses simple words.

14:48.583 --> 14:50.125
You'll miss me, honey,

14:50.708 --> 14:54.000
One of these days. Some of these days.

14:56.125 --> 14:59.916
How can I explain
this feeling of endless pain?

15:00.541 --> 15:03.458
My life, the world,

15:04.041 --> 15:06.541
who could still believe in it?

15:08.000 --> 15:12.250
She only loved things which happen.
I was the color of time.

15:13.041 --> 15:16.958
She kept speaking of other places.

15:17.041 --> 15:18.833
I would listen and dream.

15:20.250 --> 15:23.791
A woman is a gateway to the unknown.

15:23.875 --> 15:28.291
A woman is always
the victory of bare feet.

15:29.500 --> 15:34.125
Do you remember the words
of her solemn song?"

15:34.208 --> 15:35.708
I can't find a rhyme for that bit.

15:37.458 --> 15:42.875
"One day, alas, you'll be gone, Alice,

15:43.625 --> 15:45.875
Along with Lewis Carroll."

15:48.291 --> 15:50.541
Thank you, Madam.
Will you help me if I'm stuck again?

15:50.625 --> 15:53.708
I will, if you help me too.

15:54.958 --> 15:58.541
Dan't say anything to the police, OK?

16:11.625 --> 16:14.458
-Does he still work at…?
-No, they fired him.

16:17.416 --> 16:20.250
When he wakes up, say I disappeared.

17:28.791 --> 17:31.708
<i>Are you really the one who died,</i>

17:32.291 --> 17:35.250
<i>Richard, my king?</i>

17:38.000 --> 17:43.291
<i>In what kind of second-class tragedy</i>
<i>do I have to play for you?</i>

18:56.291 --> 18:59.541
<i>Fortunately, I was now a brunette,</i>

18:59.625 --> 19:03.875
<i>and Dr Korvo didn't recognize</i>
<i>the blonde student from Agadir.</i>

19:28.166 --> 19:29.458
-You don't look happy.
-Yes, yes.

19:29.541 --> 19:30.833
Haven't you found it?

19:34.125 --> 19:35.500
-Isn't this funny?
-No.

19:35.583 --> 19:36.416
Okay.

19:39.333 --> 19:41.625
-Hello, Thomas.
-Hello Sir.

19:41.708 --> 19:47.041
Don't call me sir, call me Barman or Paul.

19:47.125 --> 19:49.750
I'm not much older than you.

19:52.583 --> 19:53.833
-Please!
-Yes.

19:53.916 --> 19:55.375
Another baby, sir.

19:55.458 --> 19:57.458
Here you go, Miss Nelson.

19:59.916 --> 20:03.833
Don't call me sir, call me barman or Paul.

20:03.916 --> 20:08.583
-I'm not much older than you.
-Then how old are you? I'm 22.

20:08.666 --> 20:13.041
-In 22 years, you'll be twice that.
-Yes, in 22 years, I'll be 26.

20:13.125 --> 20:16.500
She is wrong, sir, sorry, barman or Paul.

20:16.583 --> 20:19.208
In 22 years, she'll be 44.

20:19.291 --> 20:23.083
You are good at maths,
but her French is better than yours.

20:23.166 --> 20:26.750
I can catch her, I'm only two years older.

20:26.833 --> 20:31.958
-I didn't know you were 19.
-Come on, 22 plus 35 isn't 19.

20:32.041 --> 20:37.166
Except during the war.
The result of 70 plus 14 was 40.

20:37.250 --> 20:39.750
As you're so good at maths,

20:39.833 --> 20:41.916
-I got something to ask you.
-Yes.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.333
Count every object in the bar,
for the inventory.

20:45.416 --> 20:47.166
-What's a bar?
-Coming!

20:47.250 --> 20:51.875
A bar is… A place, I mean, a room.

20:51.958 --> 20:55.708
It's several people who gather
under the eye of a barman,

20:55.791 --> 21:00.166
and also a room where liquids are served.

21:00.250 --> 21:04.500
It's several people who gather
under the eye of a barman,

21:04.583 --> 21:06.666
and also a room.

21:06.750 --> 21:09.208
A bar can't be two things.

21:09.291 --> 21:14.125
Can she be a woman and a crocodile?

21:14.833 --> 21:16.416
Embarrassing question.

21:17.041 --> 21:20.416
I'll think about it,
but tell me what objects are here.

21:20.916 --> 21:26.166
I can see a glass, bottles, a rose,

21:26.250 --> 21:29.375
windows to my right,

21:29.458 --> 21:33.833
a door that is both
in front of me and behind you.

21:33.916 --> 21:38.958
You see, one thing can be
in two different places. Go on.

21:39.041 --> 21:41.625
-A barman.
-Where is he?

21:41.708 --> 21:46.416
-Right in front of me, it's you!
-Right, I couldn't see myself.

21:46.500 --> 21:49.750
-Go on.
-An ashtray,

21:50.625 --> 21:56.250
cups, plates,
a coffee machine, three taps…

21:57.000 --> 22:02.083
-A cigarette, a striped dress.
-Four walls around the bar,

22:02.166 --> 22:06.000
the floor under our feet, a worker and me,

22:06.083 --> 22:10.083
Paula, in a situation
from which she sees no way out.

22:10.166 --> 22:13.875
You gather words at random.
You have to order them.

22:13.958 --> 22:19.208
-What for, Barman or Paul?
-What are words for, Miss?

22:19.291 --> 22:22.041
-Is it really necessary?
-I believe so.

22:22.125 --> 22:25.333
I make sentences, but I don't like it.

22:25.416 --> 22:27.416
Why don't you like it?

22:27.500 --> 22:31.125
Sentences are pointless or empty words.

22:31.208 --> 22:32.875
That's what the dictionary says.

22:32.958 --> 22:35.875
But it also says

22:35.958 --> 22:39.458
that sentences put words together…

22:41.500 --> 22:44.958
-…to make them meaningful.
-I don't agree at all.

22:45.041 --> 22:47.666
-Why?
-What's wrong with her definition?

22:48.250 --> 22:52.500
Sentences can't be meaningless
and make words meaningful.

22:52.583 --> 22:56.333
You're complicating things.
If you don't make sentences,

22:56.416 --> 22:59.958
I can't understand you,
and I can't serve you a drink.

23:00.041 --> 23:02.791
OK, Barman or Paul, I'll give it a try.

23:04.083 --> 23:06.500
The glass is not in the wine.

23:07.500 --> 23:11.416
The barman is in the pocket
of the pencil's jacket.

23:12.458 --> 23:15.708
The counter kicks the girl.

23:18.125 --> 23:20.541
The floor is stubbed out on a cigarette.

23:22.583 --> 23:25.250
The tables stand on top of the glasses.

23:25.333 --> 23:27.750
The ceiling is hung from the light.

23:30.958 --> 23:34.250
The window looks the girl in the eyes.

23:35.458 --> 23:39.583
I open them and see the door
sitting on the stool.

23:40.333 --> 23:42.458
The telephone has three bars.

23:44.958 --> 23:47.416
The coffee is filled with vodka.

23:48.208 --> 23:51.708
The Cinzano is surrounded by four walls.

23:53.166 --> 23:56.291
But the dictionary only has three windows.

23:57.250 --> 24:00.541
One American and two French ones.

24:03.333 --> 24:05.291
The doors jump out the window.

24:06.416 --> 24:09.916
The barman fills a cigarette with whisky.

24:10.958 --> 24:12.750
He lights up the tap.

24:14.333 --> 24:16.708
I am what you are.

24:18.583 --> 24:20.625
He is not what we are.

24:23.708 --> 24:25.375
They are what you are.

24:26.750 --> 24:28.291
I have what you have.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.500
He has what they have.

24:36.833 --> 24:38.541
They have what we don't have.

24:45.291 --> 24:48.625
-What do you want?
-If they ask you, say you don't know.

25:18.166 --> 25:20.166
Say something at least.

25:39.541 --> 25:41.916
"What's the maximum speed for love?

25:42.500 --> 25:46.041
The answer is 68 kilometers per hour.

25:46.125 --> 25:49.833
One kilometer more
flips you around the wrong way."

25:58.333 --> 25:59.291
Fine.

26:22.875 --> 26:28.750
ARMED FORCES WILL BE DISPATCHED
TO PROTECT THE 535 CANDIDATES

26:28.833 --> 26:33.750
IN SUNDAY'S ELECTIONS

26:36.500 --> 26:40.750
-Say something at least.
-I'm sick of this.

28:36.708 --> 28:40.791
-This is the address you asked for.
-Thanks.

28:43.583 --> 28:45.208
Whatever I do,

28:46.041 --> 28:50.291
I can't escape my responsibilities
towards others.

28:52.833 --> 28:56.833
My silence has the same effect on him
as my words.

28:58.791 --> 29:02.875
My departure troubles him,
as does my presence.

29:05.416 --> 29:10.791
My indifference can be his downfall,
as much as my help can.

29:12.791 --> 29:16.625
My concern, sometimes thoughtless,

29:18.041 --> 29:19.500
kills him.

29:24.666 --> 29:29.125
This life is either nothing,
or it has to be everything.

29:31.041 --> 29:35.875
Considering losing it,
rather than making it absurd,

29:36.875 --> 29:40.083
I place at the heart
of my relative existence

29:40.708 --> 29:43.166
an absolute standard

29:44.375 --> 29:45.875
called ethics.

29:52.958 --> 29:55.875
The absolute in this sense
is nowhere else.

29:56.708 --> 29:58.833
No past justifies it.

30:00.250 --> 30:02.416
No future could promise it.

30:04.041 --> 30:08.291
I chose to live to become more faithful

30:09.250 --> 30:10.541
to myself,

30:11.333 --> 30:12.625
to Dick

30:14.041 --> 30:15.458
and to the others.

30:19.250 --> 30:24.083
<i>Miss Daisy Canion,</i>
<i>please go to the solarium.</i>

30:24.166 --> 30:28.000
<i>Miss Daisy Canion,</i>
<i>please go to the solarium.</i>

30:35.125 --> 30:40.833
<i>Miss Ruby Gentry, please go</i>
<i>to the oxygenation room.</i>

30:44.416 --> 30:47.500
This way.

30:57.208 --> 31:02.666
<i>Calling Dr Edward Ludwig.</i>
<i>Dr Edward Ludwig.</i>

31:09.583 --> 31:15.166
<i>Calling Dr Edward Ludwig.</i>
<i>Dr Edward Ludwig.</i>

31:40.666 --> 31:44.375
-Is it you?
-Yes, Miss…?

31:44.458 --> 31:45.833
Paula Nelson.

31:46.333 --> 31:48.875
If you need a special consultation,
this is not the place.

31:48.958 --> 31:50.166
No.

31:50.250 --> 31:52.500
I just want to ask you something.

31:53.666 --> 31:56.791
-Are you a journalist?
-Who told you that?

31:57.708 --> 31:58.916
You came from Paris?

31:59.708 --> 32:02.416
I just want to know
if it's true that Dick…

32:02.916 --> 32:06.708
That Richard P… died of a heart attack.

32:08.791 --> 32:10.875
-Are you his sister?
-No.

32:11.916 --> 32:13.875
We were supposed to get married
two years ago.

32:15.958 --> 32:18.416
When things went wrong in Marseilles.

32:19.083 --> 32:21.583
Why don't you answer my question?

32:28.125 --> 32:29.458
Yes, look.

32:31.125 --> 32:33.750
This is his record, it's no secret.

32:37.500 --> 32:40.541
Yes, but even in the concentration camps,

32:40.625 --> 32:43.958
people ended up dying of a heart attack.

32:47.083 --> 32:49.500
What did he do
before coming to Atlantic City?

32:50.458 --> 32:52.000
Did you work together?

32:54.916 --> 32:56.916
Excuse me.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.250
Tell Mr Widmark
that you-know-who has called.

33:07.875 --> 33:10.958
Why did they call you
to certify his death?

33:11.041 --> 33:15.291
Because I saw him often,
we played tennis three times a week.

33:15.375 --> 33:18.291
I am the president of the club.
He was lonely.

33:18.375 --> 33:22.625
I introduced him to some friends.
He was very lonely.

33:23.416 --> 33:26.375
Loneliness doesn't kill a man.

33:26.458 --> 33:29.000
How can't you see the relationship

33:29.083 --> 33:32.833
between loneliness and illness?

33:32.916 --> 33:35.500
Why are you telling me stories

33:35.583 --> 33:37.541
when all I ask is the truth?

33:50.833 --> 33:54.416
If you don't like stories, it's a mistake.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.666
Dickens, Melville or Hammett

33:56.750 --> 34:00.625
can be more useful than movies
if you want the truth.

34:01.833 --> 34:06.708
Weren't you
the mayor's secretary until 67?

34:07.958 --> 34:11.041
He was a communist.

34:12.125 --> 34:13.583
He, too, was killed

34:15.750 --> 34:18.083
in an explosion at a gas station.

34:19.208 --> 34:23.708
The communist utopia doesn't lie
in a revolution, like 40 years ago.

34:24.500 --> 34:28.875
You sure he had no family?
We'd have to tell them.

34:28.958 --> 34:30.500
He had only me.

34:31.708 --> 34:35.666
-I'll avenge him.
-I don't understand.

34:35.750 --> 34:39.958
Well, then. There's no point in going on

34:40.041 --> 34:42.083
with this stupid conversation.

34:48.250 --> 34:50.208
<i>I got it immediately:</i>

34:50.291 --> 34:53.958
<i>this case had to remain a mystery</i>
<i>for everybody</i>

34:54.041 --> 34:55.583
<i>and I was risking my life.</i>

34:58.666 --> 35:02.083
<i>But I might also find something</i>

35:02.166 --> 35:05.458
<i>that I could later sell</i>
<i>to the opposition's press office.</i>

35:47.333 --> 35:51.250
<i>To get back Richard's belongings,</i>

35:51.333 --> 35:56.791
<i>I went back in the afternoon</i>
<i>to the address I had been given.</i>

35:56.875 --> 36:02.916
<i>Again, the weather was perfect</i>
<i>for making a color movie outdoors.</i>

36:11.541 --> 36:15.375
<i>I'd spoken to a stranger</i>
<i>who told me to go to a garage.</i>

36:16.125 --> 36:19.750
<i>I thought she had the northern accent</i>
<i>of the typist</i>

36:19.833 --> 36:22.416
<i>who had run away with him.</i>

36:37.291 --> 36:38.541
Where am I?

36:44.875 --> 36:49.041
I am traveling across countries
full of blood.

36:55.375 --> 36:57.208
War is war,

36:59.416 --> 37:01.583
no matter what it's called.

37:04.291 --> 37:05.333
War…

37:07.916 --> 37:09.041
And life?

37:11.541 --> 37:13.833
Has it been anything apart from war?

37:17.416 --> 37:19.041
Killing less than war,

37:21.833 --> 37:23.541
is that the rule in this life?

37:31.958 --> 37:33.041
Where am I?

37:44.791 --> 37:46.750
Please

37:52.125 --> 37:54.958
Why was I told
he was in a military hospital?

37:55.041 --> 37:57.500
Who gave you this address?

37:58.041 --> 37:59.708
Someone from the neighborhood.

38:00.708 --> 38:03.708
And I remembered that he liked cars.

38:04.500 --> 38:05.750
And I saw his Alfa Romeo.

38:05.833 --> 38:10.541
I asked that idiot, Donald, to burn it.

38:14.291 --> 38:17.125
-Was it because of the elections?
-Maybe.

38:18.375 --> 38:21.916
-You killed him.
-What makes you think that?

38:23.791 --> 38:26.083
The dead man at the doctor's.

38:29.416 --> 38:32.583
Dr Korvo? I know nothing about that.

38:33.500 --> 38:36.916
You might fool a movie audience,
but not me.

38:37.666 --> 38:39.750
Why do you want to avenge P…?

38:41.750 --> 38:44.750
It may surprise you, but for my ideals.

38:45.625 --> 38:46.583
True.

38:47.875 --> 38:50.208
He once wrote in an editorial:

38:51.041 --> 38:54.375
"Fascism is the dollar of ethics."

38:54.458 --> 38:58.208
-What did they do to him?
-You're mistaken.

38:58.958 --> 39:03.208
It was Dr Korvo who told Ludwig
that you had come.

39:03.291 --> 39:06.333
How did you get to Atlantic City so fast?

39:07.083 --> 39:10.541
-Who hit me?
-I'm the one asking questions.

39:10.625 --> 39:13.041
So you may as well answer them.

39:13.125 --> 39:15.875
He had kept evidence
of the mayor's murder.

39:16.666 --> 39:18.583
It had to be destroyed.

39:19.250 --> 39:23.125
Thus committing a crime again.

39:24.666 --> 39:29.291
The situation here was worse
than in Marseilles or Chicago.

39:31.916 --> 39:36.666
You know, I am the one in charge
of the settlement

39:36.750 --> 39:39.583
of the fifth district.

39:39.666 --> 39:40.750
No.

39:42.666 --> 39:45.125
If you kill me, you get no information.

39:46.833 --> 39:48.833
Your theory doesn't make sense.

39:50.791 --> 39:55.125
The main thing is to find out
if you know where it is.

39:55.666 --> 39:56.500
I don't.

39:59.875 --> 40:03.166
I tell her I know what she is looking for.

40:03.833 --> 40:09.250
She found out about P…'s death
and she thought things would be easy.

40:09.333 --> 40:13.000
And I answer that all this
is double Dutch to me.

40:23.750 --> 40:24.791
Cold.

40:28.791 --> 40:30.083
Very cold.

40:33.791 --> 40:35.666
Still very cold.

40:37.083 --> 40:38.583
South Pole.

40:41.458 --> 40:43.041
Still South Pole.

40:44.833 --> 40:46.833
Still South Pole.

40:51.500 --> 40:53.250
Still South Pole.

40:55.458 --> 40:57.166
It's getting warmer.

41:00.250 --> 41:01.458
Warmer.

41:06.500 --> 41:08.125
We pass the Equator.

41:13.083 --> 41:14.416
The Sahara.

41:16.208 --> 41:18.000
It's starting to burn.

41:20.875 --> 41:22.541
It's burning.

41:23.583 --> 41:24.708
It's burning.

41:29.750 --> 41:31.583
Come and listen to it.

41:46.625 --> 41:51.291
<i>Paragraph three.</i>
<i>Permanent revolution only makes sense</i>

41:51.375 --> 41:55.375
<i>if the diversity and seriousness</i>
<i>of the political and economical team</i>

41:55.458 --> 41:58.666
<i>allow one to get past the hazards</i>
<i>of the situation.</i>

42:00.458 --> 42:02.125
<i>Paragraph seven.</i>

42:02.666 --> 42:06.916
<i>What Robespierre and St. Just</i>
<i>had already sensed</i>

42:07.000 --> 42:09.041
<i>in the elaboration of a program…</i>

42:10.166 --> 42:13.708
<i>What Robespierre and St. Just</i>
<i>had already sensed</i>

42:13.791 --> 42:17.125
<i>in the elaboration</i>
<i>of a still to be defined program,</i>

42:17.208 --> 42:22.541
<i>but surprisingly topical,</i>
<i>others have ideas sketched out.</i>

42:22.625 --> 42:27.083
<i>I am one such person</i>
<i>and you shouldn't blame us, comrades.</i>

42:29.166 --> 42:33.333
<i>Paragraph 12.</i>
<i>As the independence of the colonies</i>

42:33.416 --> 42:37.791
<i>ends the fatalist evolution of the regime,</i>

42:37.875 --> 42:42.000
<i>the internal conquest and the fight</i>
<i>for the presidency of the Republic</i>

42:42.083 --> 42:45.375
<i>should open a new scope</i>
<i>in the activity of the clubs.</i>

42:45.875 --> 42:50.291
-Now I have changed my mind.
-Why did I go to Dr Korvo's?

42:52.333 --> 42:55.833
Why did I go to the military solarium?

42:57.416 --> 42:59.250
There was no danger.

43:02.625 --> 43:05.041
I could kill you right away.

43:07.750 --> 43:11.291
I stand here in my black suit

43:11.958 --> 43:13.666
and with a colorful tie.

43:18.166 --> 43:22.583
I tell her I still have
many friends in Paris

43:23.708 --> 43:26.250
who will be back in power one day.

43:27.166 --> 43:28.125
<i>The case is closed.</i>

43:28.208 --> 43:29.250
OK.

43:29.333 --> 43:33.250
<i>We ask nations not to base</i>
<i>their public opinion on the analysis</i>

43:33.333 --> 43:37.041
<i>of contradictory debates</i>
<i>with limited scopes,</i>

43:37.125 --> 43:42.000
<i>nor on the analysis</i>
<i>of solid proofs, but on…</i>

43:42.083 --> 43:48.333
<i>but on secret information</i>
<i>that leaked from some officials.</i>

43:48.416 --> 43:52.166
<i>Such methods, comrades… I'll start again.</i>

43:52.833 --> 43:56.666
<i>We ask nations not to base</i>
<i>their public opinion on the analysis</i>

43:56.750 --> 43:59.875
<i>of contradictory debates</i>
<i>with limited scopes,</i>

44:00.500 --> 44:04.208
<i>nor on the analysis of solid proof,</i>

44:04.291 --> 44:10.416
<i>but on secret information</i>
<i>that leaked from some officials.</i>

44:10.500 --> 44:15.291
<i>Such methods, comrades,</i>
<i>characterise a police state.</i>

45:41.541 --> 45:44.250
<i>As I looked at them both together,</i>

45:45.000 --> 45:49.833
<i>I understood the meaning</i>
<i>of the adjective "parallel"</i>

45:49.916 --> 45:51.041
<i>if applied to the police.</i>

46:27.000 --> 46:30.750
<i>The inspector looked as if</i>
<i>he had studied political sciences.</i>

46:31.458 --> 46:36.500
<i>He shouted to me to be careful</i>
<i>with those from the land settlement.</i>

46:37.833 --> 46:39.625
Dick had no secrets.

46:40.583 --> 46:43.666
He was a liar, I knew him well.

46:43.750 --> 46:48.166
Someone killed Typhus.
It wasn't me or you.

46:48.250 --> 46:51.958
Someone else is looking
for the same thing as we are.

46:54.791 --> 46:57.916
Help me. I'll help you.

46:58.708 --> 47:00.041
We'll share the benefits.

47:02.333 --> 47:04.333
Why would a cock flatter a cuckoo?

47:04.416 --> 47:07.458
-I don't understand.
-Usually the cuckoo flatters the cock.

47:07.541 --> 47:11.208
Mr Kruschev's speech to the Komsomols!

47:11.291 --> 47:13.791
I'm sure you killed Dick.

47:14.875 --> 47:18.750
Why? I don't know yet. It makes no sense.

47:19.833 --> 47:22.375
Yes, it does.

47:23.000 --> 47:24.166
You'll see.

47:25.083 --> 47:27.125
-Then you did it.
-You're annoying.

47:32.291 --> 47:34.916
-Not really.
-I don't get it.

47:39.125 --> 47:40.916
Let's say I didn't do it alone.

47:42.958 --> 47:49.000
What if I told him what I know,
what I reckon?

47:49.083 --> 47:54.666
You won't do that.
He thinks you killed Typhus.

47:54.750 --> 47:58.541
I'm the only one who knows
I was with you at that time.

47:59.500 --> 48:02.625
He doesn't look too cruel
for someone from homicide.

48:03.333 --> 48:07.458
His parents shot mine
in Dakar and Mers el-Kebir.

48:07.541 --> 48:12.000
They worked for Bony and Lafont.
My parents, in London,

48:12.083 --> 48:17.000
for Colonel Passy,
the one we used to call:

48:19.708 --> 48:23.166
-I'll take care of her.
-OK.

48:23.250 --> 48:24.916
I'll be right back.

48:45.583 --> 48:47.875
Talk.

49:14.583 --> 49:16.166
Enough.

49:26.750 --> 49:31.416
You don't know how much I hate the police.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.375
-It's her.
-You don't know how much…

49:42.458 --> 49:46.125
-She killed Uncle Edgar.
-Can't you see? He's crazy.

49:46.208 --> 49:48.750
-It's her.
-I told you to wait outside. Out!

49:51.125 --> 49:52.333
It's her.

49:57.250 --> 50:01.791
You don't know how much I hate the police.

50:06.000 --> 50:09.125
You had some business going on
with Mr Typhus, right?

50:10.375 --> 50:14.500
-I did not. You are mistaken.
-Really?

50:15.833 --> 50:17.541
That's what I thought.

50:19.166 --> 50:22.666
So, you and Mr Typhus
were only friends then?

50:23.375 --> 50:28.208
-Let's say we met several times.
-I see.

50:28.833 --> 50:31.000
You don't know how much…

50:31.083 --> 50:35.208
-What do you want?
-I'm from <i>The Atlantic City Magazine</i>.

50:35.833 --> 50:39.083
Mr Typhus, wasn't he
the Lieutenant of Jo Attila?

50:39.166 --> 50:42.500
-No comment.
-Always the same.

50:44.625 --> 50:48.625
Why are the Paris police
so scornful of local newspapers?

50:52.125 --> 50:54.500
Do you want to say anything, Miss?

50:56.833 --> 50:59.208
You knew Richard P… well?

51:00.791 --> 51:02.416
No comment either.

51:05.041 --> 51:06.791
25, rue Benech?

51:06.875 --> 51:10.916
He worked there 3 months.
From January 25th to April 25th.

51:12.500 --> 51:14.791
-Is that all?
-Yes, see you in the car.

51:44.166 --> 51:46.208
What secret?

51:46.291 --> 51:49.750
Richard P… died a natural death.
At worst, he committed suicide.

51:49.833 --> 51:53.041
A bullet to the back of the head
from three millimeters away?

51:53.125 --> 51:56.041
It wouldn't be the first time.

51:56.125 --> 51:58.125
I asked her her real name.

51:59.125 --> 52:00.541
Marie Dufour.

52:01.166 --> 52:03.458
Was she the girl who called me?

52:06.041 --> 52:07.041
Yes.

52:08.625 --> 52:09.541
Why?

52:13.500 --> 52:15.583
I told her not to be scared.

52:16.500 --> 52:19.041
Because I tried to kill myself.

52:19.125 --> 52:20.833
Why kill yourself?

52:22.333 --> 52:24.833
Was it long after Richard's death?

52:29.375 --> 52:33.750
-Or because they tortured you?
-With a razor blade.

52:34.250 --> 52:36.083
Richard told you something.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.458
They tortured you
in order to find out what?

52:42.833 --> 52:44.708
With a razor blade.

52:47.750 --> 52:49.541
What did he tell you?

52:50.708 --> 52:53.875
You're afraid they'll do it again
if you talk to me?

52:55.375 --> 52:56.541
Yes.

52:59.208 --> 53:02.375
FREEDOM

53:02.458 --> 53:06.875
NO PARKING - TRUCK EXIT

53:41.750 --> 53:45.166
Excuse me, sir. I'm Richard's sister.

53:46.041 --> 53:48.666
He worked here in February or March.

53:48.750 --> 53:49.833
Yes

53:49.916 --> 53:54.500
-Did he leave a letter or parcel for me?
-I don't know.

54:01.250 --> 54:02.750
Hello, sir.

54:08.500 --> 54:12.750
CLOSE THE DOOR

54:32.916 --> 54:34.166
Miss…

54:36.625 --> 54:39.375
What is it?

54:40.291 --> 54:43.458
Did I hear you earlier
mentioning the name Richard P…?

54:44.791 --> 54:48.041
I heard it from the accountant's office.

54:48.791 --> 54:52.791
They are scared. They doubled
our salary so we won't speak.

54:53.833 --> 54:59.166
But Mr P… was really nice with me.
He was the only one.

55:01.041 --> 55:05.875
Once he asked me to go to his house
to help with his accounts,

55:05.958 --> 55:08.875
to a villa in the suburbs.

55:08.958 --> 55:12.083
-Where?
-Close to the military aerodrome.

55:12.166 --> 55:15.375
Rue Preminger, or something like that.

55:15.458 --> 55:17.708
-That's all I know.
-Thank you.

55:24.000 --> 55:25.166
Well, well.

55:37.208 --> 55:39.208
You found anything?

55:39.291 --> 55:42.291
-No more than you.
-What makes you think that?

55:42.375 --> 55:47.083
You would either leave me alone
or make me disappear.

55:49.000 --> 55:52.208
Officer Aldrich looks more intelligent.

55:53.458 --> 55:58.208
You know what he'll do
if he finds out first who killed Typhus?

55:58.291 --> 56:01.833
He takes himself too seriously.

56:01.916 --> 56:03.458
He gets on my nerves.

56:05.125 --> 56:07.166
I have to find a way.

56:07.250 --> 56:11.208
-Did he say what he thought of me?
-What do I care?

56:11.291 --> 56:15.541
I'm in charge of the fifth district,
not him!

56:15.625 --> 56:18.541
Yes, of course.

56:19.250 --> 56:22.833
-What did you tell him?
-Tell who?

56:22.916 --> 56:24.333
David Goodis.

56:26.375 --> 56:30.458
When Aldrich questioned him again,
he got nothing.

56:32.291 --> 56:34.833
He said all this was a misunderstanding,

56:36.083 --> 56:38.166
that you looked like someone else,

56:39.291 --> 56:41.958
that he never saw you with his uncle.

56:43.500 --> 56:47.875
-What did you tell him?
-Nothing.

56:49.750 --> 56:51.541
I've been thinking.

56:53.125 --> 56:57.291
Whoever killed Typhus is probably
the same person

56:57.375 --> 56:59.333
that attacked you.

57:02.375 --> 57:07.166
I know it's silly, but it proves
that he found nothing either.

57:07.666 --> 57:09.916
-And Dr Ludwig?
-What?

57:10.000 --> 57:11.208
It might be him.

57:14.375 --> 57:15.875
I really don't understand.

57:22.666 --> 57:26.583
I really don't understand.

57:26.666 --> 57:28.916
-Why wouldn't he be involved?
-Yes.

57:29.000 --> 57:34.583
-Like you, he is my precious hostage.
-Do you really think so?

57:35.250 --> 57:38.125
What if Richard was just a dreamer.

57:38.208 --> 57:40.875
You know any communist dreamers?

57:40.958 --> 57:43.708
He was evicted from the Party
when Picasso died.

57:43.791 --> 57:47.041
That was all arranged.

57:47.125 --> 57:49.166
All arranged.

57:49.250 --> 57:50.083
What?

57:50.750 --> 57:54.708
You believed it, like everyone else.

58:07.750 --> 58:10.833
<i>The deputy who had lent him his Citroën</i>

58:10.916 --> 58:13.541
<i>had taken it back for the weekend</i>

58:14.083 --> 58:18.500
<i>and Widmark took me to the hotel</i>
<i>in his killers' Chrysler.</i>

58:18.583 --> 58:22.083
<i>I couldn't go out or I would be killed</i>

58:22.166 --> 58:25.333
<i>since I refused to tell him</i>
<i>where the villa was.</i>

58:31.291 --> 58:36.083
THE ROOM ON THE FIRST FLOOR

58:36.166 --> 58:37.958
RIPOLIN - THE MODERN PAINT

58:38.041 --> 58:43.416
WILL BE, TO US,

58:52.208 --> 58:56.375
…DES JARDINS…

58:56.458 --> 59:00.375
LIKE PARADISE.

59:18.375 --> 59:22.208
DO YOU HAVE…

59:36.916 --> 59:41.000
<i>So, since the police still suspected me</i>

59:41.083 --> 59:44.000
<i>and Widmark had me locked up,</i>

59:44.083 --> 59:48.000
<i>I gave him another call to tell him the</i>
<i>name of someone</i>

59:48.083 --> 59:52.916
<i>who, we thought, could have killed Typhus.</i>

59:56.708 --> 59:58.500
<i>Paragraph 19.</i>

59:59.458 --> 1:00:02.250
<i>Comrades, times have changed.</i>

1:00:02.333 --> 1:00:05.250
<i>But lies are still here.</i>

1:00:05.333 --> 1:00:08.125
<i>With those you know well,</i>

1:00:08.208 --> 1:00:15.000
<i>those who feel their patriotic</i>
<i>influence threatened.</i>

1:00:15.583 --> 1:00:20.083
<i>The government uses patriotic speeches</i>

1:00:20.166 --> 1:00:23.208
<i>and the excitement</i>
<i>of the nuclear adventure</i>

1:00:23.291 --> 1:00:27.500
<i>to prevent people</i>
<i>from noticing the social awakening.</i>

1:00:33.333 --> 1:00:35.208
<i>Paragraph 47.</i>

1:00:35.291 --> 1:00:40.916
<i>Dumouriez already denounced</i>
<i>the right wing's taste for parades</i>

1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:45.000
<i>that gives the mass the easy sensation</i>
<i>of courage with no danger</i>

1:00:45.083 --> 1:00:47.625
<i>and pride with no sacrifices.</i>

1:00:48.583 --> 1:00:50.291
Politics.

1:00:50.375 --> 1:00:51.416
Money.

1:00:53.375 --> 1:00:55.750
I wonder why it doesn't make me puke

1:00:55.833 --> 1:00:58.291
to have been involved in all that
for so long.

1:00:59.291 --> 1:01:00.833
Richard!

1:01:00.916 --> 1:01:02.791
<i>Paragraph 48.</i>

1:01:03.666 --> 1:01:06.625
<i>Someone asked me, with outraged eloquence,</i>

1:01:06.708 --> 1:01:11.541
<i>how French politics can aim</i>
<i>to release us from this huge power</i>

1:01:11.625 --> 1:01:18.041
<i>when part of the government</i>
<i>contributes to such crimes?</i>

1:01:19.250 --> 1:01:21.666
<i>Comrades, I'll answer this question.</i>

1:01:21.750 --> 1:01:26.750
<i>It wouldn't be the first time</i>
<i>a government had been divided between</i>

1:01:26.833 --> 1:01:31.416
<i>catholic courts and protestant lords.</i>
<i>What about Danton? Dumouriez?</i>

1:01:31.500 --> 1:01:34.833
<i>Would it be the first time</i>
<i>politics swing right and left,</i>

1:01:34.916 --> 1:01:38.041
<i>shared between the requisites</i>
<i>of a superior power…</i>

1:01:39.125 --> 1:01:42.791
<i>Would it be the first time</i>
<i>politics swing right and left,</i>

1:01:42.875 --> 1:01:46.125
<i>between the whims of an old power</i>

1:01:46.208 --> 1:01:50.125
<i>imposed on the people</i>
<i>at the expense of food</i>

1:01:50.208 --> 1:01:52.333
<i>and the next generation,</i>

1:01:52.416 --> 1:01:56.458
<i>who know they won't be able to</i>
<i>feed the nation.</i>

1:01:56.541 --> 1:01:58.750
<i>Paragraph 89.</i>

1:01:59.916 --> 1:02:02.666
<i>The main cause for our mistakes</i>

1:02:02.750 --> 1:02:08.166
<i>is that left-wing politicians</i>
<i>still accept communist votes</i>

1:02:08.250 --> 1:02:12.750
<i>while signing agreements</i>
<i>with the opposition.</i>

1:02:12.833 --> 1:02:18.666
<i>What progress can there be with</i>
<i>politicians like Lecanuet, Pinay, Pleven</i>

1:02:18.750 --> 1:02:24.333
<i>who say that only the anti-American</i>
<i>voices inside the government</i>

1:02:24.416 --> 1:02:27.083
<i>separate our politics from theirs?</i>

1:02:27.166 --> 1:02:30.875
<i>How can we want the end</i>
<i>of the present government</i>

1:02:30.958 --> 1:02:34.958
<i>when the only possible results</i>
<i>are the following:</i>

1:02:35.041 --> 1:02:36.791
<i>the survival of De Gaulle's Party,</i>

1:02:36.875 --> 1:02:41.666
<i>even if they lose the next elections,</i>

1:02:41.750 --> 1:02:46.541
<i>or a lasting discredit</i>
<i>for the democratic regime</i>

1:02:46.625 --> 1:02:51.583
<i>if the non-communist left came into power</i>

1:02:51.666 --> 1:02:54.583
<i>together with the progressive republicans.</i>

1:02:55.333 --> 1:02:57.791
<i>It is to avoid, comrades…</i>

1:02:57.875 --> 1:03:00.791
<i>It is to avoid, comrades…</i>

1:03:00.875 --> 1:03:04.333
<i>It is to avoid such options</i>

1:03:04.416 --> 1:03:08.541
<i>that the communist party</i>
<i>will keep fighting</i>

1:03:08.625 --> 1:03:11.375
<i>for a real victory of the left.</i>

1:03:12.541 --> 1:03:17.958
<i>That's probably</i>
<i>what the anti-communists fear.</i>

1:03:18.041 --> 1:03:20.916
<i>They don't want the left to win.</i>

1:03:21.583 --> 1:03:23.041
<i>It's probably…</i>

1:03:23.791 --> 1:03:25.333
That's what I thought.

1:03:26.166 --> 1:03:30.500
<i>To retaliate against his boss,</i>
<i>who no longer wanted his help,</i>

1:03:30.583 --> 1:03:34.791
<i>Donald brought me photos</i>
<i>of Richard's death.</i>

1:03:35.625 --> 1:03:37.958
<i>It was really a political movie.</i>

1:03:38.041 --> 1:03:41.875
<i>Just like a Walt Disney movie,</i>
<i>only with blood.</i>

1:03:43.500 --> 1:03:48.708
<i>He also told me</i>
<i>he had killed Typhus and his niece,</i>

1:03:49.416 --> 1:03:52.708
<i>just because they caught him</i>
<i>searching my room.</i>

1:03:53.916 --> 1:03:58.333
<i>He was looking for a treasure,</i>
<i>but now he was scared.</i>

1:03:58.416 --> 1:04:03.166
<i>He didn't believe there was a secret</i>
<i>document or a political mystery.</i>

1:04:03.250 --> 1:04:05.083
<i>He only believed in money.</i>

1:04:06.291 --> 1:04:09.041
<i>He confirmed there was a villa</i>

1:04:09.125 --> 1:04:13.375
<i>and offered to take me there</i>
<i>for two million francs.</i>

1:04:13.458 --> 1:04:16.291
<i>He wanted to go to South America,</i>

1:04:16.375 --> 1:04:18.791
<i>and, as the idealist he was,</i>

1:04:19.375 --> 1:04:24.916
<i>finance an army of killers</i>
<i>to eliminate, once for all,</i>

1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:29.458
<i>all the Jews, Black people,</i>
<i>Chinese and Indians.</i>

1:04:30.708 --> 1:04:32.125
If you had to die,

1:04:33.541 --> 1:04:38.083
would you prefer to be warned
or a sudden death.

1:04:38.166 --> 1:04:39.250
Sudden death.

1:04:44.875 --> 1:04:46.041
Mummy!

1:04:48.125 --> 1:04:49.166
Mummy!

1:04:50.750 --> 1:04:51.750
Mummy!

1:04:54.250 --> 1:04:59.458
<i>That's probably</i>
<i>what the anti-communists fear.</i>

1:05:01.166 --> 1:05:04.000
<i>To find out why Richard died</i>

1:05:04.083 --> 1:05:06.750
<i>was to find out why I would live.</i>

1:05:22.458 --> 1:05:24.583
"He finds in memories…

1:05:31.750 --> 1:05:33.958
…the lock of brown hair."

1:05:38.791 --> 1:05:41.958
-Won't you help me anymore?
-Yes.

1:05:43.500 --> 1:05:45.958
"He no longer believes…"

1:05:47.625 --> 1:05:48.541
And then?

1:05:48.625 --> 1:05:52.125
Go now, the police are here.
Help me, madam.

1:05:53.083 --> 1:05:56.791
"In our two strange destinies."
At the villa in an hour. Go.

1:05:58.041 --> 1:06:02.041
-You can leave the city if you want.
-Really? Thanks.

1:06:02.125 --> 1:06:04.125
I'm not investigating Typhus anymore.

1:06:04.208 --> 1:06:05.083
Okay.

1:06:05.875 --> 1:06:07.041
It's always the same.

1:06:09.000 --> 1:06:12.291
Orders came from Paris
to close the case temporarily.

1:06:13.375 --> 1:06:16.375
-It mustn't surprise you.
-I don't care.

1:06:18.791 --> 1:06:21.125
Was the false suspect your idea?

1:06:21.208 --> 1:06:23.041
False suspect?

1:06:23.125 --> 1:06:27.916
According to Widmark, someone called…

1:06:31.208 --> 1:06:34.666
Marc Dickson, a private detective,
killed Typhus.

1:06:34.750 --> 1:06:35.875
It's plausible.

1:06:36.583 --> 1:06:39.291
Result of an old feud
between two Moroccan War veterans.

1:06:43.500 --> 1:06:46.750
Have you arrested Mr Marc Dickson?

1:06:46.833 --> 1:06:49.583
I think it's impossible.

1:06:49.666 --> 1:06:53.791
-Why's that?
-He died in a fire near Agadir.

1:06:54.708 --> 1:06:58.375
Then why do you want to arrest him?
I don't get it.

1:06:58.458 --> 1:07:02.458
He'll be condemned in absentia.

1:07:02.541 --> 1:07:03.958
Only two people know he's dead.

1:07:04.041 --> 1:07:07.625
One is me; I was engaged to his sister.

1:07:07.708 --> 1:07:10.458
-The other one is…
-Widmark?

1:07:11.791 --> 1:07:13.208
No, not him.

1:07:15.333 --> 1:07:18.833
It's a woman with a nice dress.

1:07:18.916 --> 1:07:20.666
Exactly the same as yours.

1:07:20.750 --> 1:07:23.041
Is it orange or yellow?

1:07:23.125 --> 1:07:26.250
Isn't the case closed?

1:07:26.333 --> 1:07:27.791
Yes, I know.

1:07:28.916 --> 1:07:30.791
Did you suspect me?

1:07:30.875 --> 1:07:35.791
I didn't, but I had to consider
all the possibilities.

1:07:35.875 --> 1:07:38.791
He was killed in your room.
Did you let him in?

1:07:38.875 --> 1:07:42.375
No. Maybe he was looking for something,

1:07:43.250 --> 1:07:44.833
something to steal.

1:07:50.583 --> 1:07:52.625
Were you in the same hotel by chance?

1:07:52.708 --> 1:07:53.541
No.

1:07:54.250 --> 1:07:56.458
Had you arranged to meet?

1:07:56.541 --> 1:08:01.166
No, I didn't expect to find him there.

1:08:01.250 --> 1:08:05.375
I read in the newspaper
that Richard P… was dead.

1:08:06.208 --> 1:08:10.125
So I came. I believe he did the same.

1:08:10.208 --> 1:08:14.500
-Who did you vote for two years ago?
-It's none of your business.

1:08:15.833 --> 1:08:17.791
I can easily find out.

1:08:19.083 --> 1:08:23.166
You worked for<i>L'Express</i> earlier, in '66?

1:08:23.250 --> 1:08:26.041
-Yes, so what?
-Nothing.

1:08:26.750 --> 1:08:31.583
This Richard P… is the one
who signed the editorials?

1:08:31.666 --> 1:08:34.208
Yes, he stayed.

1:08:34.291 --> 1:08:37.166
I quit when
they started accepting advertisements.

1:08:37.250 --> 1:08:38.125
Why?

1:08:38.791 --> 1:08:43.083
Because advertising is a form of fascism.

1:08:46.458 --> 1:08:50.333
When Goodis reconsidered
his declaration, I understood.

1:08:50.416 --> 1:08:51.958
I'm not as stupid as you think.

1:08:52.666 --> 1:08:55.958
You're mixed up in a political matter

1:08:56.041 --> 1:08:58.666
where personal feelings play a part:

1:08:59.583 --> 1:09:02.500
revenge, jealousy, friendship.

1:09:03.791 --> 1:09:05.708
If I were you, I'd go back to Paris.

1:09:05.791 --> 1:09:07.708
Something bad is going to happen.

1:09:08.541 --> 1:09:09.958
Do yourself a favor.

1:09:10.666 --> 1:09:15.416
We are living in an old part
of the universe

1:09:16.041 --> 1:09:19.041
where nothing happens,

1:09:19.125 --> 1:09:23.250
when somewhere else, galaxies
are still being created by explosions.

1:09:24.916 --> 1:09:25.875
Goodbye.

1:09:39.916 --> 1:09:42.916
<i>GOODBYE TO LIFE. GOODBYE TO LOVE.</i>

1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:48.125
Quiet! Quiet!
You'll get everybody into trouble.

1:09:48.208 --> 1:09:49.708
I don't believe it.

1:10:04.083 --> 1:10:06.541
Tell Ludwig I'll call him tonight.

1:10:06.625 --> 1:10:08.416
OK, but it's the last time.

1:10:37.916 --> 1:10:40.333
-What's your name?
-Robert MacNamara.

1:10:40.416 --> 1:10:44.291
-Aren't you fed up with killing?
-It's my job. Makes me happy.

1:10:46.250 --> 1:10:49.708
-What about you?
-Richard Nixon, I agree.

1:10:49.791 --> 1:10:52.541
Let's see your boss.

1:10:52.625 --> 1:10:54.541
-I don't know where he is.
-I do.

1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:14.416
Get moving.

1:11:17.208 --> 1:11:18.333
FREEDOM

1:11:20.958 --> 1:11:23.166
I still wear the yellow and red dress

1:11:24.166 --> 1:11:25.750
but my has voice changed.

1:11:27.208 --> 1:11:30.541
I told him it was barbaric
to torture the woman

1:11:30.625 --> 1:11:32.333
to get the address of the villa.

1:11:37.541 --> 1:11:42.708
I answered that it's not the first time
I have blood on my hands.

1:11:48.750 --> 1:11:52.041
Agadir, the subway in Charonne…

1:11:53.541 --> 1:11:55.166
…Mehdi Ben Barka.

1:11:58.541 --> 1:12:01.875
I paid that fat woman 100,000 francs

1:12:01.958 --> 1:12:05.083
to invent a story to justify her burns.

1:12:08.916 --> 1:12:12.125
Always blood, fear,

1:12:12.208 --> 1:12:15.125
politics, money.

1:12:16.666 --> 1:12:19.166
I wonder why it doesn't make me puke

1:12:19.250 --> 1:12:21.250
to have been involved in all that
for so long.

1:12:24.083 --> 1:12:25.666
Richard!

1:12:25.750 --> 1:12:27.083
THE LEFT, YEAR ZERO

1:12:27.166 --> 1:12:31.083
<i>It is to avoid such options</i>
<i>that the communist party</i>

1:12:31.166 --> 1:12:35.333
<i>will keep fighting</i>
<i>for a real victory of the left.</i>

1:12:35.416 --> 1:12:38.708
-I dismissed the others.
-Richard killed Lacroix.

1:12:38.791 --> 1:12:42.291
-If I have to kill her, I want no one.
-The fire was nothing.

1:12:42.375 --> 1:12:44.208
The Party met at the villa…

1:12:44.291 --> 1:12:49.625
-The Party blamed the socialists.
-Without its own members.

1:12:50.833 --> 1:12:54.166
-It was good for them.
-Two years ago, in '67…

1:12:54.750 --> 1:12:57.500
-They killed Richard…
-…they split from the left.

1:12:57.583 --> 1:12:59.375
…because he was too involved.

1:12:59.458 --> 1:13:00.541
Ran away.

1:13:00.625 --> 1:13:03.791
That's how it started. That's my opinion.

1:13:04.416 --> 1:13:07.375
-Lacroix, the mayor,
-As for me…

1:13:07.458 --> 1:13:08.791
-Richard P…,
-I'm sinking.

1:13:09.500 --> 1:13:14.375
-…all had to shut up.
-I should've gone back to Paris.

1:13:14.458 --> 1:13:17.750
Because of her, the fight goes on.

1:13:18.916 --> 1:13:23.208
-Now I have to end it.
-Killing and eliminating opponents…

1:13:23.291 --> 1:13:27.083
-Play, pretend, lie.
-…instead of quietly using power…

1:13:27.166 --> 1:13:29.375
I'd rather be on an Italian beach.

1:13:29.458 --> 1:13:33.583
-…to open dams and boost the economy.
-Dreams of sun and water.

1:13:40.083 --> 1:13:44.083
We can't trust each other,
it's impossible.

1:13:44.583 --> 1:13:47.708
There is too much to lose. It's a pity.

1:13:48.833 --> 1:13:53.583
We won't get anywhere
if we keep spying on each other.

1:13:57.208 --> 1:13:59.500
Don't forget who killed Typhus.

1:14:00.458 --> 1:14:02.083
Maybe you're right.

1:14:02.958 --> 1:14:05.875
We should trust each other.

1:14:05.958 --> 1:14:07.916
That's what I've just said.

1:14:11.875 --> 1:14:14.000
I'll speak frankly, Paula.

1:14:16.708 --> 1:14:22.166
Even if you swore on all Lenin's works
that it were sunny outside,

1:14:22.250 --> 1:14:27.125
I wouldn't believe you
without checking it for myself.

1:14:28.208 --> 1:14:30.958
I can't trust you,

1:14:32.041 --> 1:14:33.791
it's absolutely impossible.

1:14:33.875 --> 1:14:36.291
-I think there's a way.
-What's that?

1:14:37.583 --> 1:14:39.375
I provide you with a weapon

1:14:39.958 --> 1:14:43.583
that turns against me if I betray you.

1:14:45.083 --> 1:14:46.875
I really don't understand.

1:14:49.791 --> 1:14:51.166
I write a letter

1:14:52.250 --> 1:14:55.750
in which I say I killed Typhus.

1:14:57.166 --> 1:14:58.958
I sign it.

1:15:00.375 --> 1:15:02.125
Then I give it to you.

1:15:02.208 --> 1:15:04.791
That's clever.

1:15:05.291 --> 1:15:07.291
That's not a bad idea.

1:15:07.375 --> 1:15:09.708
That way, I can trust you.

1:15:09.791 --> 1:15:12.875
Yes. But you too.

1:15:13.750 --> 1:15:17.791
-Me too, what?
-You have to write a letter, too.

1:15:17.875 --> 1:15:21.708
To say what?
That I killed Typhus? Are you stupid?

1:15:23.708 --> 1:15:25.750
No, you'll write that you killed Richard.

1:15:34.625 --> 1:15:38.166
<i>I'd stay alive at any price.</i>

1:15:38.250 --> 1:15:40.666
<i>Otherwise, sooner or later,</i>

1:15:40.750 --> 1:15:46.083
<i>I'd end up like the 17 witnesses</i>
<i>to Kennedy's death, killed too,</i>

1:15:46.625 --> 1:15:50.000
<i>as</i> Le Monde <i>stated on October 10th</i>.

1:15:51.625 --> 1:15:56.833
-"I killed Richard P…"
-"I killed Edgar Typhus."

1:15:56.916 --> 1:15:59.125
"He tried to extort money from me."

1:15:59.791 --> 1:16:02.375
"He came into my room."

1:16:02.458 --> 1:16:05.083
"His death was an accident."

1:16:05.166 --> 1:16:07.500
"We argued."

1:16:07.583 --> 1:16:10.416
"Dr Ludwig knows all about it."

1:16:10.500 --> 1:16:13.125
"I knocked him out with an ashtray."

1:16:13.208 --> 1:16:18.125
"He helped me hide the facts
thanks to his political contacts."

1:16:18.208 --> 1:16:20.583
"September 17th, 1968."

1:16:20.666 --> 1:16:23.791
"Paul Widmark, September 17th, 1968."

1:16:23.875 --> 1:16:25.166
"Paula Nelson."

1:16:26.666 --> 1:16:28.583
-Is it OK?
-Sure.

1:16:37.125 --> 1:16:40.041
-Hands in the air!
-What's wrong?

1:16:40.125 --> 1:16:41.750
Don't move.

1:16:45.708 --> 1:16:48.000
Now I know you've found it.

1:16:52.833 --> 1:16:55.625
That's why you got the idea of the letter.

1:16:56.666 --> 1:16:58.166
I haven't found anything.

1:16:59.833 --> 1:17:02.541
There's no secret, no mystery.

1:17:02.625 --> 1:17:04.416
You're lying.

1:17:04.500 --> 1:17:09.000
I don't have any reason to lie.

1:17:10.041 --> 1:17:11.208
Not anymore.

1:17:12.791 --> 1:17:15.416
Because you know you're going to die?

1:17:15.500 --> 1:17:16.500
Yes.

1:17:21.625 --> 1:17:23.375
Thanks, David.

1:17:25.916 --> 1:17:29.416
"Far from time and space…

1:17:31.166 --> 1:17:32.958
…people are confused…

1:17:35.833 --> 1:17:37.625
…as thin as hairs…

1:17:39.583 --> 1:17:41.291
…as large as dawn.

1:17:44.291 --> 1:17:45.958
They have foamy ears,

1:17:48.750 --> 1:17:50.708
disgusted eyes.

1:17:52.916 --> 1:17:57.750
They stretch their hands forward
to touch the scenery,

1:17:58.583 --> 1:18:00.166
a non-existent scenery."

1:18:04.250 --> 1:18:07.625
Thanks, Madam.
This way, I can finish my novel.

1:18:07.708 --> 1:18:09.166
No, David.

1:18:13.541 --> 1:18:17.708
No, David. You have to prepare to die.

1:18:21.250 --> 1:18:23.458
The truth mustn't be revealed.

1:18:24.291 --> 1:18:27.083
If you finish it,
the world will learn the truth.

1:18:27.166 --> 1:18:29.375
Poetry shows the truth.

1:18:29.458 --> 1:18:32.750
Why do you always use metaphors?

1:18:32.833 --> 1:18:34.625
If I speak about time,

1:18:35.625 --> 1:18:37.250
it's still to come.

1:18:38.541 --> 1:18:42.208
If I speak about a place,
it has disappeared.

1:18:43.791 --> 1:18:45.583
If I speak about time,

1:18:46.958 --> 1:18:48.708
it's gone already.

1:18:51.208 --> 1:18:53.041
If I speak about a man…

1:18:55.041 --> 1:18:56.541
…he's about to die.

1:19:01.375 --> 1:19:05.500
Paula, you stole my youthfulness.

1:19:11.875 --> 1:19:13.041
David…

1:19:17.625 --> 1:19:19.041
Sadness.

1:19:23.583 --> 1:19:27.958
<i>Where am I? Am I the one talking?</i>

1:19:28.041 --> 1:19:31.375
<i>Can I say that I am</i>
<i>this language that I speak,</i>

1:19:31.458 --> 1:19:33.458
<i>invaded by my thoughts?</i>

1:19:34.166 --> 1:19:38.041
<i>Can I say that I am</i>
<i>these murders I committed,</i>

1:19:38.125 --> 1:19:42.250
<i>which I don't see as a job,</i>
<i>not only when it's over,</i>

1:19:43.083 --> 1:19:45.375
<i>but before it even starts?</i>

1:19:47.041 --> 1:19:50.625
<i>Can I say that I am</i>
<i>the life I feel inside of me?</i>

1:19:51.666 --> 1:19:54.875
<i>It's all around me at incredible times of…</i>

1:20:00.000 --> 1:20:04.750
The night is as long as the day

1:20:04.833 --> 1:20:06.916
in this never-ending equinox.

1:20:09.416 --> 1:20:10.625
When it comes,

1:20:11.791 --> 1:20:13.041
I go on.

1:20:14.458 --> 1:20:16.500
I'll go before dawn.

1:20:20.583 --> 1:20:21.541
<i>Birth.</i>

1:20:22.541 --> 1:20:23.875
<i>Death.</i>

1:20:24.708 --> 1:20:27.208
<i>The life of things around me.</i>

1:20:27.291 --> 1:20:30.166
<i>The life of my own body,</i>

1:20:30.250 --> 1:20:32.375
<i>the body that Richard would kiss.</i>

1:20:33.166 --> 1:20:38.000
<i>This knowledge is by its very nature</i>
<i>incomplete and misleading</i>

1:20:38.083 --> 1:20:41.875
<i>because it comes only</i>
<i>from changes to my body</i>

1:20:41.958 --> 1:20:42.791
<i>and to my thoughts.</i>

1:20:46.291 --> 1:20:48.416
The problem of my consciousness

1:20:50.208 --> 1:20:54.125
is that, having lost my world,
I attempt to survive,

1:20:55.041 --> 1:20:57.375
but this attempt causes my death.

1:21:04.208 --> 1:21:05.416
Philippe!

1:21:24.333 --> 1:21:26.583
Why are you here?

1:21:26.666 --> 1:21:31.333
I'm making a documentary
about Châteauroux. And you?

1:21:32.125 --> 1:21:35.625
I got mixed up in a bad case.

1:21:35.708 --> 1:21:38.583
-I killed two men.
-I can't believe it.

1:21:39.208 --> 1:21:41.458
-Can you give me a lift?
-OK.

1:21:51.333 --> 1:21:54.333
THE LEFT, YEAR ZERO

1:21:58.291 --> 1:21:59.875
You shouldn't be scared.

1:22:00.541 --> 1:22:03.416
-Fascism won't happen.
-Yes,

1:22:04.208 --> 1:22:08.416
On the contrary,
it has to happen, and it will,

1:22:08.500 --> 1:22:14.125
like sailing boats, miniskirts,
rock and roll.

1:22:16.375 --> 1:22:19.041
We've years of fighting ahead of us,

1:22:20.750 --> 1:22:22.875
often fighting within ourselves.

1:22:27.125 --> 1:22:28.625
That's why I am scared,

1:22:30.333 --> 1:22:32.416
scared of being tired beforehand,

1:22:33.583 --> 1:22:37.083
scared of abandoning the fight.

1:22:40.291 --> 1:22:43.708
-Have you got a cigarette?
-In the glove compartment.

1:22:49.416 --> 1:22:51.416
-Want one?
-No, thanks.

1:22:58.041 --> 1:22:59.750
You know,

1:23:01.708 --> 1:23:04.625
I think Richard's death was a revenge.

1:23:05.166 --> 1:23:09.083
But none of it's very clear.

1:23:09.166 --> 1:23:11.291
Was Ben Barka's case clear?

1:23:11.375 --> 1:23:15.541
-That's an old story.
-True,

1:23:15.625 --> 1:23:17.625
but I have principles.

1:23:20.250 --> 1:23:23.250
-Do you still work for that paper?
-Yes.

1:23:24.166 --> 1:23:27.750
Are you going to write an article

1:23:27.833 --> 1:23:32.333
or a book, like the one
you wanted to write about Oswald?

1:23:32.416 --> 1:23:33.500
Probably.

1:23:34.416 --> 1:23:37.958
Then don't say you have principles.

1:23:44.458 --> 1:23:45.291
No.

1:23:46.875 --> 1:23:51.333
You won't ever change.

1:23:51.416 --> 1:23:52.416
What?

1:23:53.875 --> 1:23:57.125
Remember Elisabeth,
in<i>Les Enfants Terribles</i>?

1:24:00.833 --> 1:24:03.166
The left and the right are the same.

1:24:04.291 --> 1:24:06.916
They won't ever change.

1:24:09.625 --> 1:24:10.916
The right,

1:24:11.875 --> 1:24:14.458
because its cruelty makes it stupid,

1:24:16.375 --> 1:24:19.291
and the left because it's too sentimental.

1:24:20.083 --> 1:24:23.875
Actually, the right and the left

1:24:24.541 --> 1:24:26.833
are obsolete terms.

1:24:30.500 --> 1:24:32.375
We shouldn't phrase it like that.

1:24:33.208 --> 1:24:34.416
What should we say then?

1:24:53.791 --> 1:24:56.250
THE END
