WEBVTT

00:02.182 --> 00:04.480
Oh, Kelly, is, uh, Clare there?

00:04.585 --> 00:08.453
Hey, Valerie, hold on a second.

00:09.990 --> 00:11.355
Come in.

00:12.059 --> 00:13.151
Ms. Malone?

00:13.193 --> 00:14.251
Yeah, uh,

00:14.295 --> 00:15.728
can you put that
on the bed, please?

00:18.732 --> 00:20.666
And can you put it on my tab?

00:20.701 --> 00:21.725
l'm sorry,

00:21.769 --> 00:23.327
l was told your account
was topped off.

00:23.370 --> 00:25.201
-You were told?
-By Mr. Brennan,

00:25.239 --> 00:26.638
the hotel manager.

00:26.674 --> 00:29.040
He also asked me
to give you this.

00:29.076 --> 00:30.168
Hello?

00:30.210 --> 00:32.110
Clare, um, can you hold on
just a second?

00:32.146 --> 00:33.272
Yeah.

00:33.314 --> 00:35.305
Will you tell Mr. Brennan
that l will speak to him later?

00:36.350 --> 00:37.908
Uh, certainly.

00:39.920 --> 00:43.617
Clare, listen, uh, good news,
the, uh, film company decided

00:43.657 --> 00:45.887
to use the club tomorrow night
for the premiere party.

00:45.926 --> 00:48.053
Valerie, l told you
l can't help.

00:48.095 --> 00:50.529
l have to work on a project with
David for school all weekend.

00:50.631 --> 00:52.189
Clare, thanks.

00:52.232 --> 00:53.324
Okay.

00:53.367 --> 00:55.267
Uh, l gotta go,
can you call me tonight?

00:55.302 --> 00:57.167
Yeah.

00:59.173 --> 01:00.470
Hey, where'd Kelly go?

01:00.507 --> 01:02.134
Uh, she was late
for a dentist appointment.

01:02.176 --> 01:03.302
Oh.

01:03.344 --> 01:04.470
Well, thank you
for lunch,

01:04.510 --> 01:05.876
but you didn't
have to make

01:05.913 --> 01:07.881
such a big deal of
me moving back in.

01:07.915 --> 01:09.644
Well, it was lonely here
without you.

01:09.683 --> 01:11.275
Oh, not that you
can't still stay

01:11.318 --> 01:12.683
-with Daddy and me.
-Mom, l've been

01:12.720 --> 01:14.585
cooped up at home
for three weeks.

01:14.622 --> 01:16.089
Look, l'm

01:16.123 --> 01:18.023
not gonna let what happened
paralyze me anymore.

01:18.058 --> 01:19.025
Okay, but you

01:19.059 --> 01:20.424
promise me you'll
come home

01:20.461 --> 01:21.689
if you don't
feel safe here.

01:21.729 --> 01:22.991
Safe? How can l
not feel

01:23.030 --> 01:24.156
safe?

01:24.198 --> 01:26.894
New house alarm, a car alarm,
a license for mace...

01:26.934 --> 01:28.333
l drew the line at the Doberman.

01:29.637 --> 01:31.332
Hey, how's it going?

01:31.372 --> 01:32.464
Better late than never.

01:32.506 --> 01:34.030
l decided to stop
by and say hi.

01:34.074 --> 01:35.268
That was sweet of you.

01:35.309 --> 01:37.504
David, l've been meaning
to thank you

01:37.611 --> 01:39.101
for everything you
did for Donna.

01:39.146 --> 01:40.374
Ah...

01:40.414 --> 01:41.813
lt almost makes me wish

01:41.849 --> 01:42.941
you were still living here.

01:44.451 --> 01:46.510
Anyway, um, my mom
has to go.

01:46.553 --> 01:47.520
-You're...
-Oh.

01:47.554 --> 01:49.078
-All right
-Bye.

01:51.392 --> 01:52.689
-Mother.
-What?

01:52.726 --> 01:54.216
What are you up to?

01:54.261 --> 01:56.161
What? l'm not up
to anything.

01:56.196 --> 01:59.131
With Ray out of the picture,
l don't know,

01:59.166 --> 02:01.100
maybe you and David
will give it another chance.

02:01.135 --> 02:04.901
Ray is not out of the picture,
he's out of town.

02:04.938 --> 02:06.667
And David,
if you hadn't noticed,

02:06.707 --> 02:08.607
he's got
a girlfriend.

02:08.642 --> 02:12.942
Well, maybe, but you're the one
he cares about.

02:12.980 --> 02:15.244
Really?

02:15.282 --> 02:17.375
What, he told you this
or you just happened

02:17.418 --> 02:18.715
to read his mind or something?

02:18.752 --> 02:22.381
No, sweetheart, it's written
all over his face.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:10.030 --> 04:12.021
Hey, how you doing?

04:17.337 --> 04:19.464
l'm gonna pick up some extra
videotape for this weekend

04:19.540 --> 04:21.565
so we don't have to
skimp on footage, okay?

04:21.608 --> 04:24.008
Yeah, l just hope these guys
can pull this off.

04:24.044 --> 04:25.636
Whatever we get,
we'll make it work.

04:25.679 --> 04:27.670
That's why the project's
called ''Real Life'', right?

04:27.714 --> 04:29.477
Hey, there's one
of the guys right now-- Tuck!

04:29.516 --> 04:31.245
Oh, great, this is
the one l can't stand.

04:31.285 --> 04:33.082
Hey, what's
going on, man?

04:33.120 --> 04:34.280
Yeah, what do you
want, Silver?

04:34.321 --> 04:35.879
Uh, you remember Clare,
my partner, right?

04:35.923 --> 04:36.890
Yeah.

04:36.924 --> 04:40.189
Hi. Say, when did you say
that, uh, thing was?

04:40.227 --> 04:41.194
Uh, we start tomorrow.

04:41.228 --> 04:42.217
Early.

04:42.262 --> 04:44.287
All we're gonna do
is film you and your guys

04:44.331 --> 04:45.923
doing your normal routine
for 24 hours.

04:45.966 --> 04:48.867
Nah-- mm-mm.

04:48.902 --> 04:50.096
Nah, this
isn't gonna fly.

04:50.137 --> 04:51.104
Next.

04:51.138 --> 04:52.264
Why not?

04:52.306 --> 04:54.501
'Cause my roommates are too
P.O.'d at me these days.

04:54.575 --> 04:56.406
No, no, no, we
agreed to this.

04:56.443 --> 04:58.502
You have tons of time to
talk to them about this.

04:58.545 --> 04:59.910
We didn't sign a contract
or anything.

04:59.947 --> 05:01.972
Find some other lab rats
or blow it out your shorts.

05:02.015 --> 05:03.983
-Tuck! -What can l say?
The Tuckster

05:04.017 --> 05:07.009
has his own program,
and you dorks are not on it.

05:11.158 --> 05:12.955
''Just leave the location
up to me, Clare.

05:12.993 --> 05:14.085
l'll take care
of everything.''

05:14.127 --> 05:15.890
Clare, l did take care
of it, all right?

05:15.929 --> 05:16.987
-He changed it.
-No.

05:17.030 --> 05:18.429
Losing all six
of our subjects

05:18.465 --> 05:20.456
and the location
is not taking care of it, David.

05:20.567 --> 05:22.467
You know, maybe if you hadn't
have been putting off doing this

05:22.502 --> 05:24.595
-for the last week... -You know
what, Clare, why don't you just

05:24.638 --> 05:25.696
stop with the whole
control freak bit, okay?

05:25.739 --> 05:26.899
You know what,
there is a reason

05:26.940 --> 05:28.965
why l am a control freak,
and that is because

05:29.009 --> 05:31.136
everybody in this world
seems to be a flake.

05:31.178 --> 05:32.372
Well, l'm sorry.

05:32.412 --> 05:33.470
Well, that's
not good enough.

05:33.513 --> 05:35.811
l submitted a 20-page proposal,

05:35.849 --> 05:37.043
including character sketches,

05:37.084 --> 05:38.483
of six people
to Professor Karsky.

05:38.552 --> 05:40.884
He is expecting
a 30-minute video

05:40.921 --> 05:42.115
Monday morning featuring Tuck
and his roommates.

05:42.155 --> 05:43.122
What are we gonna do?

05:43.156 --> 05:45.021
We're just gonna have
to go with plan B.

05:45.058 --> 05:46.685
What plan B?

05:46.727 --> 05:51.027
The one we, uh,
have to come up with right now.

05:51.064 --> 05:53.396
You know, l really
should have known better

05:53.433 --> 05:55.025
than to tie up my grade
with yours.

05:55.068 --> 05:56.035
l really should've.

05:56.069 --> 05:58.469
Oh, thanks.

06:02.843 --> 06:04.674
Look, l have to tell you,
Mr. Brennan,

06:04.711 --> 06:07.043
this is not a good day
to be harassing me.

06:07.080 --> 06:09.640
Forgive me, but
there never seems

06:09.683 --> 06:11.412
to be a good day
to get people

06:11.451 --> 06:12.645
to take care
of their bills.

06:12.686 --> 06:14.711
Uh, Ms. Malone,

06:14.755 --> 06:17.189
your tab has become
rather unwieldy.

06:17.224 --> 06:18.248
Well, l'm good for it.

06:18.292 --> 06:19.281
Oh, l...

06:19.326 --> 06:22.159
l'm sure you are, but uh,
perhaps you'd like

06:22.195 --> 06:23.924
to take a look at your total.

06:27.501 --> 06:29.401
Now, this includes
charges from the

06:29.436 --> 06:31.301
restaurant, the
spa, the boutique

06:31.338 --> 06:34.398
and the daily rate
for your suite, of course.

06:35.509 --> 06:37.409
Look, l have to tell you,
Mr. Brennan,

06:37.444 --> 06:39.708
l don't understand
why you're singling me out.

06:39.746 --> 06:42.146
l don't see you knocking
on the doors of other guests

06:42.182 --> 06:44.707
around here to pay up
when they're not ready.

06:44.751 --> 06:47.379
We like to handle
these matters discreetly.

06:47.421 --> 06:49.981
That's why l asked
to see you privately.

06:50.023 --> 06:53.356
Well, l appreciate
your discretion.

06:54.561 --> 06:58.292
ln fact, um, l was wondering,

06:58.332 --> 07:02.166
since l am a hotel resident
and not a short-term guest,

07:02.202 --> 07:05.603
that maybe you could give me
a special rate?

07:05.639 --> 07:09.541
You're already receiving
our special rate, Ms. Malone.

07:09.576 --> 07:13.103
Well, l was thinking
maybe you and l could, uh,

07:13.146 --> 07:15.011
think of a new rate,

07:15.048 --> 07:16.743
be creative.

07:16.783 --> 07:18.683
What do you say?

07:18.719 --> 07:20.983
l say...

07:21.021 --> 07:22.818
We accept
all major credit cards.

07:22.856 --> 07:25.222
Or a personal check,
if you prefer.

07:38.705 --> 07:40.104
Hi, Clare.

07:40.140 --> 07:41.971
Thought l heard
you coming.

07:42.009 --> 07:44.876
Hi, yourself.

07:44.911 --> 07:46.469
What, are you
still mad at me?

07:46.580 --> 07:48.480
l don't know what
you're smiling about, you know,

07:48.515 --> 07:50.483
but l've decided to take
an incomplete in Communications.

07:50.517 --> 07:52.178
Well, it's not gonna
be necessary.

07:52.219 --> 07:54.187
No, l'll be going
to summer school

07:54.221 --> 07:56.883
before l take a bad grade
in any class.

07:58.825 --> 08:02.226
Clare, you're not gonna have
to go to summer school.

08:05.399 --> 08:07.196
What's going on?

08:07.234 --> 08:10.601
lt's plan B: six roommates,
''24 Hours of Real Life,''

08:10.637 --> 08:12.935
a video essay
by Clare Arnold

08:12.973 --> 08:14.372
-and David Silver.
-And David already

08:14.408 --> 08:15.875
gave us our character
assignments,

08:15.909 --> 08:17.570
so we'll be ready
for tomorrow.

08:17.611 --> 08:19.374
So, we're back on?

08:19.413 --> 08:21.278
-Looks that way.
-Yeah, we'll all be, uh,

08:21.314 --> 08:23.805
pretending to be Tuck
and his roommates.

08:23.850 --> 08:25.442
Yeah, you and l
will set the scenes,

08:25.552 --> 08:27.577
and then, the rest of it,
we'll just improvise.

08:27.621 --> 08:30.784
Well, as long
as l have a bed, l'm in.

08:30.824 --> 08:32.313
You're sleeping here?

08:32.359 --> 08:33.326
We all are.

08:33.360 --> 08:34.621
We're roomies, remember?

08:34.660 --> 08:36.652
Actually, l think l got
the best character.

08:36.696 --> 08:39.893
''Scarlett, a classical musician
who hails from London,

08:39.933 --> 08:42.924
oblivious to the crush
her roommate, Andy, has on her.''

08:42.969 --> 08:44.960
And l'm Andy,
''the shy but nerdy guy

08:45.005 --> 08:46.905
in awe of Scarlett's
musical talent.''

08:46.940 --> 08:48.100
Well, l
definitely have

08:48.141 --> 08:49.608
the toughest
role to play.

08:50.844 --> 08:52.368
Are you gonna
play Todd?

08:52.412 --> 08:55.313
Yeah, ''a quiet
country guy

08:55.348 --> 08:56.474
with a drinking
problem.''

08:56.583 --> 08:58.210
He's a real nice guy,
though.

08:58.251 --> 08:59.843
Talk about a stretch!

08:59.886 --> 09:00.910
Whew.

09:00.954 --> 09:02.615
What about you, Kel,
who are you gonna play?

09:02.656 --> 09:06.683
Uh, ''Trish, party girl
from the Valley.

09:06.726 --> 09:09.422
''Loves drinking, dancing
and grungy men

09:09.496 --> 09:10.793
from Seattle.''

09:10.831 --> 09:12.924
Ooh, this l can't wait
to see.

09:12.966 --> 09:14.331
You know, l think
you especially

09:14.367 --> 09:15.629
are going to enjoy my
interpretation.

09:15.669 --> 09:16.727
-ls that so?
-Mm-hmm.

09:16.770 --> 09:20.331
l guess that leaves
me with... Beth.

09:20.373 --> 09:22.170
Yeah, somebody
had to play her.

09:22.209 --> 09:25.007
l know, she's just so
negative and uptight.

09:25.045 --> 09:26.979
Oh, l know, it's
that whole typecasting thing.

09:27.013 --> 09:28.640
Hmm, so that leaves

09:28.682 --> 09:30.047
you with, uh, Tuck, huh?

09:30.083 --> 09:32.051
The original
weasel on wheels?

09:32.085 --> 09:35.418
Yah! And let me tell you
doughheads something,

09:35.455 --> 09:37.286
you owe me a major debt
of gratitude

09:37.324 --> 09:38.621
for this, dudes, 'kay?

09:38.658 --> 09:39.852
Yah!

09:39.893 --> 09:41.451
Save it for
the cameras.

09:41.528 --> 09:43.223
You know, l think

09:43.263 --> 09:47.063
this just might
work after all.

09:47.100 --> 09:49.534
l have a feeling it's
gonna be a blast.

09:53.273 --> 09:55.571
Mr. Walsh, it's your wife
on line 12.

09:55.609 --> 09:57.042
Fine.

09:57.077 --> 09:58.339
Hey, honey, what's up?

09:58.378 --> 10:02.178
Honey, you remember how you said
you'd give Valerie

10:02.215 --> 10:05.116
two weeks
before she left that hotel?

10:05.152 --> 10:06.278
Yeah.

10:06.319 --> 10:08.048
lt took three.

10:10.457 --> 10:11.617
She's back?

10:11.658 --> 10:13.182
She's unpacking right now.

10:13.226 --> 10:14.284
Just like that?

10:14.327 --> 10:16.318
You took her back,
no questions asked?

10:16.363 --> 10:18.422
Come on, Jim,
what was l gonna do,

10:18.465 --> 10:19.693
refuse her?

10:19.733 --> 10:22.201
Well, you could at least
lay some ground rules this time.

10:22.235 --> 10:24.226
l thought you would do that.

10:24.271 --> 10:26.671
Right, leave it
to the bad cop, huh?

10:26.706 --> 10:28.037
You're a softy, kid.

10:28.074 --> 10:32.636
Honey, the thought of her living
in that big, lonely hotel,

10:32.679 --> 10:34.340
it just got to me.

10:34.381 --> 10:36.349
Yeah, l know, l know.

10:36.383 --> 10:38.248
Maybe if we talk to her,
she'll be different this time.

10:38.285 --> 10:39.252
Right.

10:39.286 --> 10:40.981
And maybe Brandon
will join the ministry.

10:41.021 --> 10:42.716
Ha-ha-ha...

10:42.756 --> 10:45.725
So... we'll, uh,
see you at dinner?

10:45.759 --> 10:48.023
Yeah, table for four-- see you.

10:48.061 --> 10:49.085
Bye.

10:52.499 --> 10:54.262
You know, it's really good
to be home.

10:54.301 --> 10:56.735
lt feels
like l never left.

11:01.641 --> 11:04.109
1 :38

11:06.179 --> 11:07.476
David.

11:07.514 --> 11:09.038
What?

11:09.082 --> 11:11.209
We can't do this.
Won't Karsky

11:11.251 --> 11:12.718
recognize us in the video?

11:12.752 --> 11:14.777
Clare, there's hundreds
of people in his class.

11:14.821 --> 11:16.288
By the time we're in character,

11:16.323 --> 11:18.291
Karsky's never going
to know it's us.

11:18.325 --> 11:20.225
Yeah, you're right.

11:20.260 --> 11:22.421
He's clued out
half the time anyway.

11:22.462 --> 11:24.760
Okay, so this is
what l thought we'd do.

11:24.798 --> 11:27.028
Uh, we'll start with the
breakfast vignette...

11:27.067 --> 11:27.897
the roommates arguing about

11:27.934 --> 11:29.401
the fight in the
kitchen, and then...

11:29.436 --> 11:31.028
Can't we do something
a little more original?

11:31.071 --> 11:33.232
That's the number one fight
roommates have.

11:33.273 --> 11:35.298
lt's classic.
Trust me, it'll be great.

11:35.342 --> 11:37.708
How come we never go
with any of my ideas?

11:37.744 --> 11:38.711
We do.

11:38.745 --> 11:40.269
When they're good.

11:40.313 --> 11:43.305
Which to you is almost never.

11:43.350 --> 11:46.649
l just want it to be
better than good.

11:48.054 --> 11:51.785
What's wrong with aspiring
to make it great?

11:51.825 --> 11:53.053
Okay, fine, fine.

11:53.093 --> 11:54.856
l'm too tired to argue.
You win.

11:54.894 --> 11:56.885
Well, l still think you
should have played ''Tuck.''

11:56.930 --> 11:58.329
Get back at that jerk.

11:58.365 --> 12:00.060
Mm-hmm.

12:00.100 --> 12:02.967
l mean, whose idea was it
for you to play the guy

12:03.003 --> 12:05.471
who has a crush on Donna anyway?

12:09.509 --> 12:11.636
Good night, David.

12:11.678 --> 12:12.940
Good night, Donna.

12:14.781 --> 12:15.975
Donna?

12:16.016 --> 12:17.847
What, what's wrong?

12:17.884 --> 12:20.114
You just called me Donna,
that's what's wrong.

12:20.153 --> 12:23.645
Well, l, uh,
l must have been dreaming.

12:23.690 --> 12:24.987
Oh.

12:25.025 --> 12:26.492
Thanks a lot.

12:26.559 --> 12:28.584
Clare...

12:28.628 --> 12:30.061
Clare...

12:30.096 --> 12:33.031
Clare... Clare,
what did l do?

12:41.508 --> 12:45.410
Hey, geezer, what are
you doing up with the birds?

12:46.813 --> 12:48.303
What did you call me?

12:48.348 --> 12:52.375
Geezer. l'm just trying out
my new act on you, Dad.

12:52.419 --> 12:53.681
l mean,
l'm no Brenda Walsh,

12:53.720 --> 12:56.120
but l think l'm getting the hang
of playing someone obnoxious.

12:56.156 --> 12:58.056
l'll say.

12:58.091 --> 12:59.422
Just don't make it a habit.

12:59.459 --> 13:01.188
Someone get up
on the wrong side?

13:01.227 --> 13:03.957
No. Just trying
to figure out what's behind

13:03.997 --> 13:06.591
Valerie's sudden return
to the nest.

13:06.633 --> 13:08.260
Well, she said she missed
the family atmosphere.

13:08.301 --> 13:11.395
But l think it has more to do
with the size of her hotel bill.

13:11.438 --> 13:13.201
Mm.

13:13.239 --> 13:16.436
Speaking of atmosphere,
l smelled something familiar

13:16.476 --> 13:17.943
coming out of her room
last night,

13:17.977 --> 13:19.376
and it was not incense.

13:19.412 --> 13:22.472
Ask me no questions,
l'll tell you no lies, geeze.

13:22.549 --> 13:24.176
Gotta go!
Smell you later!

13:25.485 --> 13:27.749
lt frightens me how good you are
at that.

13:27.787 --> 13:29.687
Yah!

13:32.192 --> 13:33.352
Okay. We're gonna start

13:33.393 --> 13:35.452
with you three talking
about the party tonight,

13:35.495 --> 13:37.087
then you're gonna find
the mess in the kitchen,

13:37.130 --> 13:39.223
and then Todd's
gonna enter.

13:39.265 --> 13:43.895
Now remember, do not come in
until Trish mentions Tuck, okay?

13:43.937 --> 13:46.064
Don't worry.
l'm up on this, okay?

13:46.106 --> 13:47.937
-l wish we had a script.
-l know.

13:47.974 --> 13:50.636
No, improvising will make it
more realistic. Trust me.

13:50.677 --> 13:52.474
Okay,
where's Brandon?

13:52.512 --> 13:54.377
He's becoming his character.
He's late.

13:54.414 --> 13:56.507
So what do l do
before l enter?

13:56.583 --> 13:58.107
Just hang out behind
the monitor,

13:58.151 --> 13:59.618
and make sure
the camera doesn't see you.

13:59.652 --> 14:00.812
Okay, you guys ready?

14:00.854 --> 14:02.287
Mm-hmm.

14:02.322 --> 14:05.155
And we are... rolling.

14:05.191 --> 14:06.886
So, Beth, are
we gonna party down

14:06.926 --> 14:08.655
for your birthday
or what?

14:08.695 --> 14:11.459
l don't really think
anyone is gonna wanna come.

14:11.564 --> 14:14.556
Well, l'm sure Todd will be
there with bells on.

14:14.601 --> 14:16.899
l think he fancies you, Beth.

14:16.936 --> 14:19.029
No, l don't think so.

14:19.072 --> 14:20.369
Oh, blast!

14:20.407 --> 14:24.343
Who's left our kitchen
such a sty?

14:24.377 --> 14:26.572
Oh, somebody majorly skanked
this joint out.

14:26.613 --> 14:28.478
Yeah, and drank
my orange juice, too.

14:28.581 --> 14:30.139
Mm, l bet it was Tuck.

14:31.818 --> 14:33.149
l bet it was Tuck.

14:36.389 --> 14:39.119
l can't tell a lie;
i-it was me.

14:39.159 --> 14:41.024
A thousand apologies.

14:42.328 --> 14:44.228
Aw, shucks. l was just
trying to prepare

14:44.264 --> 14:47.700
some watermelon slices
for Beth here's party.

14:47.734 --> 14:48.996
Cut!

14:49.035 --> 14:50.195
Steve,
you're totally overacting.

14:50.236 --> 14:51.726
l thought you said
he has a crush on her.

14:51.771 --> 14:53.762
Steve, this is
a documentary. l think Todd

14:53.807 --> 14:54.967
would be a little more...

14:55.008 --> 14:57.704
l don't know, natural,
not quite so obvious.

14:57.744 --> 14:59.644
But how's he going to get
anywhere that way?

14:59.679 --> 15:00.873
Steve, that's not the point.

15:00.914 --> 15:03.246
You've got to start thinking
like Todd, not like Steve.

15:06.319 --> 15:08.810
Excuse me.
''Todd'' needs five.

15:08.855 --> 15:11.153
l'll be in my trailer,
ladies and gentlemen.

15:12.258 --> 15:13.987
Hello.

15:14.027 --> 15:15.858
All right, guys.
l guess we're gonna move on

15:15.895 --> 15:17.692
to the point where you guys find
the vodka

15:17.730 --> 15:18.719
in Todd's orange juice.

15:18.765 --> 15:20.460
Now, remember,
the vodka's only water,

15:20.500 --> 15:21.865
so you're gonna have
to pretend.

15:21.901 --> 15:23.698
Ooh,
good direction.

15:23.736 --> 15:25.465
Don't act so surprised, okay?

15:25.538 --> 15:27.301
You okay?
You ready to go?

15:27.340 --> 15:28.898
-Yeah, l'm all right.
-Yeah.

15:28.942 --> 15:30.876
And we're rolling!

15:30.910 --> 15:34.869
Hey, l wonder if Todd wants
the rest of his OJ.

15:34.914 --> 15:38.543
Hey, this smells
like a screwdriver.

15:39.853 --> 15:42.481
lndeed! Hmm!

15:44.357 --> 15:46.484
lt's 10:00 in the
morning, you guys.

15:46.593 --> 15:49.426
l'm kind of worried
about Steve.

15:49.462 --> 15:50.429
Todd.

15:50.463 --> 15:51.691
What?

15:51.731 --> 15:53.756
You're worried about ''Todd,''
not Steve.

15:53.800 --> 15:54.994
Oh, sorry.
This is so hard.

15:55.034 --> 15:56.467
That's great.
You know what? Actually,

15:56.503 --> 15:57.663
let me get
back to you...

15:57.704 --> 16:00.764
Well, look, here
comes the chap now.

16:00.807 --> 16:02.934
So, um,
how goes it, Todd?

16:02.976 --> 16:04.876
l can't believe my life
sometimes.

16:04.911 --> 16:06.742
My ex-girlfriend and l
haven't been apart

16:06.779 --> 16:08.838
for a year and already
she's getting married.

16:08.882 --> 16:10.873
Steve, you're overacting again.

16:10.917 --> 16:13.647
How can l be overacting?!
This is my life!

16:13.686 --> 16:14.914
What?

16:14.954 --> 16:17.149
Not ''Todd,'' Steve!
This is me, Steve!

16:17.190 --> 16:18.987
Celeste is
getting married?!

16:19.025 --> 16:20.788
To the guy she met
in Hawaii?

16:20.827 --> 16:22.988
No, some naval officer
she's just met

16:23.029 --> 16:24.621
in the last three months.

16:24.664 --> 16:26.461
They're gonna tie the knot

16:26.499 --> 16:29.468
before he leaves
on his next assignment.

16:29.502 --> 16:31.936
lt's the Sanders curse.

16:34.073 --> 16:35.631
Are you filming this?

16:35.675 --> 16:36.733
Do you mind?

16:36.776 --> 16:38.971
No, no. l...

16:40.780 --> 16:43.408
l... l-l just...

16:43.449 --> 16:45.041
l just don't know

16:45.084 --> 16:48.019
how much more of this
l can take.

16:48.054 --> 16:51.581
When is this pattern of
losing and loving gonna end?

16:54.327 --> 16:56.454
Cut it. Okay?

16:57.830 --> 17:00.162
Take five, guys.
This is stupid.

17:07.640 --> 17:09.574
Hey, sweetie, l'm home.

17:09.608 --> 17:11.372
Um, good.

17:11.411 --> 17:13.571
l was hoping
we could talk before, uh...

17:13.613 --> 17:15.843
What did the cat drag in?

17:15.882 --> 17:16.848
lsn't this great?

17:16.883 --> 17:18.942
l found it by the curb
while l was jogging.

17:18.984 --> 17:20.577
l can't believe somebody
threw this thing out.

17:20.619 --> 17:23.555
Somebody probably threw it out
because it's broken.

17:23.589 --> 17:25.319
Oh, come on, it's
just some minor stuff.

17:25.358 --> 17:26.950
Look, we can replace
a few columns,

17:26.992 --> 17:28.050
re-sand it,
refinish it.

17:28.094 --> 17:29.356
Hannah's going
to love it.

17:30.496 --> 17:32.896
What? Didn't you take
wood shop in junior high?

17:32.932 --> 17:35.730
Yeah, it's the only class
l ever got a ''C'' in.

17:35.768 --> 17:37.463
Well, l passed with honors.

17:37.503 --> 17:39.095
l will supervise the handiwork.

17:39.138 --> 17:41.299
Aw, come on, look.
lt's gonna look great

17:41.341 --> 17:44.139
in the corner of Hannah's
room, just like that.

17:44.177 --> 17:45.405
Huh?

17:45.445 --> 17:47.174
Okay, well, we'll try it.

17:47.213 --> 17:49.408
Yes!

17:49.449 --> 17:52.509
So, what do we have
to talk about?

17:58.124 --> 18:00.251
You know,
nothing that can't wait.

18:00.293 --> 18:02.022
-You sure?
-Mm.

18:02.061 --> 18:03.119
Sure.

18:03.162 --> 18:04.151
Okay.

18:04.197 --> 18:05.221
Look at this.

18:05.264 --> 18:09.166
Daisies, roses...

18:09.202 --> 18:12.069
Think we need a whole
new rocking chair.

18:12.105 --> 18:15.597
''Real Life,'' scene four,
take 20.

18:18.077 --> 18:19.135
Action!

18:47.740 --> 18:49.435
Scarlett's music is so great.

18:49.475 --> 18:52.569
She's just so, so talented.

18:52.612 --> 18:55.342
l know somewhere
under that cool veneer,

18:55.381 --> 18:57.781
she's just got a heart of gold.

19:01.688 --> 19:04.054
A little practical joke
on Trish tonight.

19:04.090 --> 19:06.524
Come around here.

19:08.361 --> 19:10.158
This here particular
watermelon

19:10.196 --> 19:13.029
has a tasteless,
odorless surprise. Ooh-wee!

19:13.066 --> 19:15.557
-Hey, Todd.
-Hi.

19:15.601 --> 19:16.659
Can l have some?

19:16.703 --> 19:19.035
Help yourself.
Thanks.

19:20.740 --> 19:22.970
Yo, dudes!

19:23.009 --> 19:24.271
-Whoa!
-Hey!

19:24.310 --> 19:25.436
Watch it!

19:25.545 --> 19:27.445
Huh! Why don't you get out
of the way, bimbette,

19:27.547 --> 19:29.208
and then l won't have
to watch it, will l?

19:29.248 --> 19:30.647
You know, you are
puke; you reek.

19:30.683 --> 19:33.015
Oh, yeah?
Well, get a good whiff, baby,

19:33.052 --> 19:35.646
'cause my own personal hygiene
is my own business.

19:35.688 --> 19:37.178
l am my own man.
l am Tuck.

19:37.223 --> 19:39.248
Now why don't you
just chill out

19:39.292 --> 19:41.556
before l cut the cheese
right in your face, man.

19:50.903 --> 19:52.768
What the hell is this?!

19:52.805 --> 19:54.830
Uh, Tuck. What are
you doing here?

19:54.874 --> 19:55.932
l came over

19:55.975 --> 19:58.341
to tell you, l got my roommates
to okay your project.

19:58.377 --> 20:01.005
Yeah, well, we kind of had
a change in the plans.

20:01.047 --> 20:02.742
What is this
doughhead doing?

20:02.782 --> 20:03.874
Spoofing me?

20:03.916 --> 20:05.577
l got rights, man!

20:05.618 --> 20:07.609
This is a total invasion
of privacy!

20:07.653 --> 20:09.985
Yeah, well, you kind of
left us hanging here.

20:10.022 --> 20:12.490
This is way too uncool!
Un-cool!

20:12.592 --> 20:14.184
You're not getting
away with this.

20:14.227 --> 20:16.092
You're dead, Silver!

20:16.129 --> 20:17.562
You're dead!

20:25.171 --> 20:27.833
You're dead, Silver.

20:27.874 --> 20:31.002
l knew something like this
was going to trip us up.

20:31.043 --> 20:33.136
l'll work it out.

20:33.179 --> 20:34.612
Yeah, l've heard that before.

20:34.647 --> 20:39.050
Kell, l got to tell you,
this is, uh, it's spiked.

20:39.085 --> 20:41.076
Oh, yeah, yeah.
l know, Steve.

20:41.120 --> 20:42.485
l get the gig.

20:42.522 --> 20:44.251
No. l'm not talking
about prop vodka.

20:44.290 --> 20:46.690
l'm talking about
the real stuff.

20:46.726 --> 20:49.160
Hmm... Mmm!

20:49.195 --> 20:51.026
Well, Trish is
a party girl.

20:51.063 --> 20:52.325
lt'll get me
into character.

20:52.365 --> 20:53.593
Ooh...

20:55.001 --> 20:57.094
l should've used
the Everclear.

20:59.138 --> 21:02.369
Hey. You two look like you're
studying for an exam.

21:02.408 --> 21:03.875
Well, actually, we're doing
a little research

21:03.910 --> 21:07.243
for a parapsychological
screenplay.

21:07.280 --> 21:08.440
Oh.

21:08.481 --> 21:10.949
And l take it, uh,
this is the writer?

21:10.983 --> 21:12.245
Yeah, you know
it's not me.

21:12.285 --> 21:14.014
Charley, Nat...
Nat, Charley.

21:14.053 --> 21:15.452
Hey. l hope you don't mind us

21:15.488 --> 21:17.115
camping out in your place here
while we work.

21:17.156 --> 21:18.418
Nah, not at all.

21:18.457 --> 21:20.982
Just give me a ''special thanks''
in the credits.

21:21.027 --> 21:22.051
That's a deal.

21:22.094 --> 21:24.085
No deals.

21:24.130 --> 21:27.065
Nat. Can l ask a favor?

21:27.099 --> 21:29.363
Valerie.

21:29.402 --> 21:30.369
Ask away.

21:30.403 --> 21:32.428
Well, the caterers want to use
the kitchen...

21:32.471 --> 21:34.268
Valerie?

21:34.307 --> 21:37.401
This is the Valerie that
l've been hearing about?

21:37.443 --> 21:39.308
Yeah, one and the same.

21:40.880 --> 21:42.313
Okay.

21:45.718 --> 21:48.050
Hi. Haven't seen
you lately.

21:48.087 --> 21:49.782
Ah, lucky me.

21:49.822 --> 21:51.016
Who's your friend?

21:51.057 --> 21:52.024
l'm Charley.

21:52.058 --> 21:53.025
Hi.

21:53.059 --> 21:54.321
Hey.

21:54.360 --> 21:56.157
So, um...

21:56.195 --> 21:57.389
What kind of party are
you throwing?

21:57.430 --> 21:59.398
Um, a sci-fi
movie premiere,

21:59.432 --> 22:00.729
Touch of the Swami.

22:00.766 --> 22:02.199
Oh, Leo Tanner!

22:02.235 --> 22:03.259
You know him?

22:03.302 --> 22:04.326
l know his work.

22:04.370 --> 22:05.632
He's a great director.

22:05.671 --> 22:07.332
Well, you guys should
come by tonight.

22:07.373 --> 22:08.362
Oh, l would love to.

22:08.407 --> 22:09.465
But you can't,

22:09.575 --> 22:12.043
'cause we're working
on this screenplay right now.

22:12.078 --> 22:14.342
Yeah, but we'll be there.

22:14.380 --> 22:15.677
Hey, there's
nothing wrong

22:15.715 --> 22:17.410
with a little
showbiz networking.

22:17.450 --> 22:20.977
Well, l'll see
you guys tonight.

22:21.020 --> 22:21.987
Nice meeting you.

22:22.021 --> 22:24.819
Good to meet you.

22:24.857 --> 22:27.223
Baby, you know l can.

22:30.696 --> 22:32.823
l wasn't going to go
to Beth's party.

22:32.865 --> 22:34.765
l've got tickets
to the symphony.

22:34.800 --> 22:36.961
But l thought
it might be

22:37.003 --> 22:39.494
a bit educational to spend
a night among the proletariat.

22:40.573 --> 22:41.767
Was that okay?

22:41.807 --> 22:43.331
That was perfect.

22:43.376 --> 22:44.809
You know,

22:44.844 --> 22:46.778
l don't think l've ever
used the word ''proletariat''

22:46.812 --> 22:47.779
in my life.

22:47.813 --> 22:49.405
Yeah, that was
a pretty good ad-lib.

22:49.448 --> 22:52.008
Thank you.

22:52.051 --> 22:54.144
So, uh,
did you and Tuck make peace?

22:54.186 --> 22:55.517
Well, let me put it
this way.

22:55.621 --> 22:57.680
ln order to keep Tuck
from suing us,

22:57.723 --> 22:59.748
l had to promise
that my next project would be

22:59.792 --> 23:01.987
a documentary
on mountain biking,

23:02.028 --> 23:03.256
which of course
he'll star in.

23:04.297 --> 23:05.662
Drives a hard bargain, huh?

23:05.698 --> 23:06.722
Yeah.

23:13.839 --> 23:16.171
What's wrong?

23:18.210 --> 23:22.078
l was... l was just
thinking about the last time

23:22.114 --> 23:26.483
that you and l
were in this room.

23:26.552 --> 23:28.383
l mean, l thought
l'd gotten over it.

23:28.421 --> 23:31.219
Don't worry.

23:31.257 --> 23:32.519
lt's going to
take some time.

23:35.328 --> 23:37.387
lt's okay.

23:37.430 --> 23:39.728
Hey, do you guys want
watermelon for dessert?

23:39.765 --> 23:42.495
Hey, save some of that stuff
for the scenes later, Kelly.

23:42.535 --> 23:45.026
Trish, my name's
Trish, remember?

23:45.071 --> 23:46.504
Yeah, Method actress.

23:46.605 --> 23:48.197
Okay, guys,
l'm going to grab some mics.

23:48.240 --> 23:50.231
Okay? l'll be right back.

24:04.590 --> 24:05.989
You okay?

24:06.025 --> 24:07.492
Yeah.

24:27.446 --> 24:30.745
We'd better stop, though.

24:30.783 --> 24:32.910
Wouldn't want anyone
to get the wrong idea.

25:09.822 --> 25:11.119
Hey!

25:12.224 --> 25:14.249
Tuck, Tuck, Tuck, Tuck, Tuck!

25:14.293 --> 25:15.419
Does that bother you?

25:16.495 --> 25:18.190
Back off, man.

25:18.230 --> 25:19.857
Anybody want some more
of this?

25:19.899 --> 25:21.161
No, l think Trish has had

25:21.200 --> 25:22.792
-quite enough.
-Yeah, of you.

25:22.835 --> 25:23.859
Yeah.

25:23.903 --> 25:26.269
You're funny.

25:26.305 --> 25:30.002
David, here, take over for me.

25:30.042 --> 25:31.839
Hey, Todd,

25:31.877 --> 25:33.071
come here.

25:33.112 --> 25:34.477
-Me?
-Yeah.

25:34.580 --> 25:36.514
You want to dance with me, stud?

25:45.758 --> 25:50.092
Boy, you sure do loosen up
at parties.

25:50.129 --> 25:53.792
During the day l'm just
a neurotic, insecure mess,

25:53.833 --> 25:58.463
but at night when the glasses
come off, look out.

26:11.784 --> 26:15.379
lf no one's going to
get the phone, l will.

26:17.356 --> 26:20.325
Well, l didn't see
that coming, huh?

26:21.994 --> 26:25.020
l'm sure glad
it did, though.

26:25.064 --> 26:26.053
Sorry.

26:27.099 --> 26:29.897
Well, l guess Beth

26:29.935 --> 26:31.163
has a wild side,
huh?

26:32.204 --> 26:33.637
Did you get that on tape?

26:33.672 --> 26:35.606
'Cause l would really
love to see it again.

26:35.641 --> 26:36.767
lt's for you.

26:36.809 --> 26:38.276
For me?

26:39.678 --> 26:41.043
Thank you.

26:41.080 --> 26:44.607
Hello.

26:44.650 --> 26:45.776
Hi, Mom.

26:45.818 --> 26:49.151
Uh, Silver, Silver,
Silver, do me a favor.

26:49.188 --> 26:52.055
No more watermelon parties
for ''Trish,'' huh?

26:52.091 --> 26:53.956
-Okay.
-What?

26:53.993 --> 26:55.893
l don't believe it.

26:55.928 --> 26:57.589
How pathetic can you be?

26:57.630 --> 26:58.756
No, l'm not
going to--

26:58.797 --> 27:00.662
no, l'm not going
to stop,

27:00.699 --> 27:02.223
not till you show
a little dignity.

27:04.069 --> 27:05.866
-What's going on?
-My mother--

27:05.905 --> 27:09.534
my spineless, insecure mother--

27:09.575 --> 27:12.373
has asked your father to move
back in with her again.

27:12.411 --> 27:14.242
-You're kidding.
-How could Mel take

27:14.280 --> 27:16.612
Jackie back? l mean he, he
cheated on her, he lied to her,

27:16.649 --> 27:18.276
he totally humiliated her.

27:18.317 --> 27:19.443
Kelly, look,
no one's forcing her

27:19.485 --> 27:20.816
to do anything.

27:20.853 --> 27:22.377
No, that's exactly it.

27:22.421 --> 27:24.184
That makes it worse;
she has no pride.

27:24.223 --> 27:27.056
l mean... l don't get it.

27:27.092 --> 27:28.218
What is with you guys?

27:28.260 --> 27:29.227
What is it--

27:29.261 --> 27:31.729
why are you always
letting us down?

27:31.764 --> 27:35.029
Why is it so impossible
to be faithful?

27:35.067 --> 27:38.468
l mean,
Mel cheated on Jackie.

27:38.537 --> 27:40.164
Right?
You had Emily.

27:40.206 --> 27:43.039
-Now, hold on a s...
-No, shh.

27:43.075 --> 27:44.440
David,

27:44.476 --> 27:46.808
being like his father,
had Ariel.

27:46.845 --> 27:48.073
The examples

27:48.113 --> 27:49.375
are endless.

27:49.415 --> 27:51.474
Well, Ray has not cheated on me.

27:51.584 --> 27:53.108
No, not that you know of,

27:53.152 --> 27:54.779
but he probably has
a little side dish

27:54.820 --> 27:56.117
out on tour
with him.

27:56.155 --> 27:57.315
l never cheated

27:57.356 --> 27:59.256
-on you, Kelly.
-No, you didn't.

27:59.291 --> 28:00.690
But you did cheat on Celeste

28:00.726 --> 28:02.591
and that's probably
why she's marrying a frogman.

28:02.628 --> 28:03.993
l mean,

28:04.029 --> 28:05.929
every member of the male species

28:05.965 --> 28:07.796
has a lousy track record
in this area

28:07.833 --> 28:08.891
and it makes me sick.

28:08.934 --> 28:11.334
You all make
me so sick.

28:11.370 --> 28:14.567
You make me sick.

28:14.607 --> 28:16.336
Sick!

28:17.376 --> 28:19.367
Sick.

28:19.411 --> 28:20.605
Ugh.

28:20.646 --> 28:24.480
Well, thanks for such
a great time, Silver.

28:26.051 --> 28:27.575
You know what, guys,
let's take a break,

28:27.620 --> 28:29.554
all right?

28:36.595 --> 28:39.758
What do you like-- the orange
or the pink flowers better?

28:40.966 --> 28:42.558
Don't ask me,
Rembrandt.

28:42.601 --> 28:44.466
l don't have an artistic bone
in my body.

28:44.570 --> 28:45.468
Ah, neither do l.

28:45.571 --> 28:47.266
l'm just winging it.

28:47.306 --> 28:49.467
Well, you sure got a lot
of raw talent.

28:49.508 --> 28:51.169
Yeah, right.

28:52.411 --> 28:54.038
Jess, this is fun.

28:54.079 --> 28:55.046
Yeah.

28:55.080 --> 28:57.913
Sort of therapeutic,
huh?

28:57.950 --> 28:59.042
Yeah.

29:00.085 --> 29:02.383
You know, it's been too long

29:02.421 --> 29:03.615
since we've done
something like this,

29:03.656 --> 29:05.419
you know, l mean, just for fun.

29:05.524 --> 29:06.752
Yeah,

29:06.792 --> 29:09.522
l guess our marriage has become
a bit of a routine.

29:11.563 --> 29:14.589
Sometimes l forget
how good it is,

29:14.633 --> 29:16.430
you know,
just to feel like this.

29:17.670 --> 29:19.035
-Me, too.
-Yeah?

29:19.071 --> 29:20.265
-Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah, yeah?

29:20.306 --> 29:21.273
Oh, that's sharp.

29:21.307 --> 29:23.366
That's real sharp.

29:36.622 --> 29:38.590
Well, you can bring out
the grilled veggies now,

29:38.624 --> 29:40.057
and fill any empty wine glasses.

29:40.092 --> 29:41.059
Okay?

29:41.093 --> 29:43.459
Oh, including mine.

29:43.562 --> 29:44.620
A woman of
authority.

29:44.663 --> 29:45.630
l like that.

29:45.664 --> 29:47.757
Me, too.

29:47.800 --> 29:51.292
Now, once l get the band
going, um, l'll be all yours.

29:53.339 --> 29:55.933
l know you have your
doubts about this, Dylan,

29:55.974 --> 29:59.671
but, uh... that Valerie,
she's not half bad.

29:59.712 --> 30:01.441
Yeah, she makes
a good first impression.

30:01.480 --> 30:03.675
Her second impression's
pretty sweet, too.

30:03.716 --> 30:04.808
Charley?

30:04.850 --> 30:07.785
Oh, hey, hey, hey,
that's Evan Ames.

30:07.820 --> 30:10.118
Oh, man, he would be
perfect to score the film.

30:10.155 --> 30:11.747
So why don't you stroll on
over there

30:11.790 --> 30:13.849
and score a meeting, eh?

30:13.892 --> 30:14.916
Good idea, good idea.

30:14.960 --> 30:15.927
Charley?

30:15.961 --> 30:16.928
Hi.

30:16.962 --> 30:18.259
Dr. Campbell.

30:18.297 --> 30:19.264
What are you doing here?

30:19.298 --> 30:20.765
Oh, l was a consultant
on this film.

30:20.799 --> 30:21.959
Oh, that's great.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.968
Oh, uh, Dylan, this
is Dr. Molly Campbell.

30:24.002 --> 30:25.663
Hi.

30:25.704 --> 30:26.796
She's my old
hyponotherapist.

30:26.839 --> 30:28.670
She gave me the inspiration
for the script.

30:28.707 --> 30:29.696
Oh.

30:29.742 --> 30:31.505
You're finally doing that?

30:31.543 --> 30:32.874
-Yeah, and Dylan's helping me.
-Well, great.

30:32.911 --> 30:33.935
Look, if there's anything
l can do

30:33.979 --> 30:35.241
to help,
give me a call, huh?

30:35.280 --> 30:36.247
We may do that.

30:36.281 --> 30:37.680
Good.

30:37.716 --> 30:38.705
Nice to meet you.

30:38.751 --> 30:40.082
-Yeah.
-And great to see you.

30:40.119 --> 30:41.086
Oh.

30:41.120 --> 30:42.519
l'm so proud of you.

30:42.588 --> 30:43.953
Thanks.

30:43.989 --> 30:45.183
l'm so proud of you.

30:45.224 --> 30:47.419
Excuse me, um, do you mind?

30:47.459 --> 30:49.450
Oh.

30:50.629 --> 30:54.190
Listen, uh...
do me a favor, will you?

30:54.233 --> 30:55.825
-What?
-Don't leave tonight

30:55.868 --> 30:57.733
without seeing me.

31:06.912 --> 31:08.573
You know what, guys?

31:08.614 --> 31:10.639
Guys, it's already
two minutes past midnight.

31:10.682 --> 31:13.776
l think it's safe to say
this, uh, ''Real Life'' thing

31:13.819 --> 31:15.480
can go down as a complete
and utter disaster.

31:15.587 --> 31:17.487
Oh, Davey,

31:17.589 --> 31:19.489
our scenes turned out
to be pretty bogus, huh?

31:19.558 --> 31:21.219
Yeah, especially
that scene, Steve.

31:21.260 --> 31:25.390
The problem is that we tried
to keep up these characters,

31:25.431 --> 31:28.025
but our real personalities
just kept on coming through.

31:28.066 --> 31:30.398
Oh, is that what happened?

31:30.436 --> 31:32.028
You're cut off.

31:32.070 --> 31:33.503
l think so.

31:33.572 --> 31:36.632
So, when David was
so convincingly looking

31:36.675 --> 31:38.643
at you
with those puppy dog eyes...

31:38.677 --> 31:39.644
Clare.

31:39.678 --> 31:40.872
What?

31:40.913 --> 31:42.437
Come on,
let's get it out there.

31:42.481 --> 31:45.245
You still love Donna,
right?

31:46.485 --> 31:47.713
You know, l think
it's pretty normal

31:47.753 --> 31:50.244
to still care about somebody
you had a relationship with.

31:50.289 --> 31:52.484
David, answer the question.

31:54.493 --> 31:57.360
Yeah.

31:57.396 --> 31:58.863
Yeah, l still
love Donna.

31:58.897 --> 32:01.092
And you?

32:01.133 --> 32:02.566
Do l love Donna?

32:02.601 --> 32:04.432
No, Clare, do you have feelings
for anyone else--

32:04.470 --> 32:05.664
l don't know, Brandon maybe?

32:05.704 --> 32:07.433
l was never with Brandon,
all right?

32:07.473 --> 32:10.306
Yeah, but you wanted to be
and l, l think you still do.

32:12.778 --> 32:16.475
All right, if you must know...

32:16.515 --> 32:20.349
yeah, l still have feelings
for Brandon.

32:20.385 --> 32:21.511
Okay?

32:34.032 --> 32:36.432
Oh, please, make the
room stop spinning.

32:36.468 --> 32:38.299
l would if l could.

32:38.337 --> 32:40.202
Brandon?

32:40.239 --> 32:41.706
Yeah, l'm here.

32:41.740 --> 32:43.605
l'm here.

32:43.642 --> 32:47.703
You weren't,
right when l needed you most.

32:49.014 --> 32:51.209
What are you talking about?

32:51.250 --> 32:52.842
You know
what l'm talking about.

32:52.885 --> 32:55.149
l'm talking
about fire night.

32:55.187 --> 32:58.918
Kelly, l already said
l'm sorry for that.

32:58.957 --> 33:00.015
Why?

33:00.058 --> 33:03.824
What did you do that you have
to be sorry for?

33:03.862 --> 33:07.354
Honey, you're talking
in non-sequiturs again.

33:07.399 --> 33:10.664
No, l'm talking
about cheating.

33:10.702 --> 33:11.726
l think you're
just drunk

33:11.770 --> 33:13.203
and you need to
get a little sleep.

33:13.238 --> 33:16.207
N-No, no, l know l may be
a little wasted,

33:16.241 --> 33:19.642
but l remember
l started a conversation

33:19.678 --> 33:21.805
in that living room
about cheating,

33:21.847 --> 33:23.644
and l didn't hear a peep
out of you.

33:23.682 --> 33:26.048
Hey, no one could get
a word in edgewise

33:26.084 --> 33:27.745
while you were going
off on that.

33:29.788 --> 33:32.757
l'd like to know
what you were doing with Emily

33:32.791 --> 33:35.419
when l was trapped
in that house.

33:35.460 --> 33:36.449
What do you mean?

33:36.495 --> 33:37.484
l mean,

33:37.529 --> 33:40.521
were you sleeping with her?

33:43.035 --> 33:44.502
Tell me, Brandon.

33:44.570 --> 33:46.504
No, l didn't sleep with her.

33:46.572 --> 33:48.506
We kissed good-bye,
that's it.

33:48.540 --> 33:51.270
Well, l want to believe you.

33:51.310 --> 33:53.369
Kelly,

33:53.412 --> 33:56.404
Emily is in France
and l'm here with you.

33:56.448 --> 33:58.416
That's all that
matters.

33:58.450 --> 34:00.418
Good.

34:00.452 --> 34:02.920
Because l-l love you

34:02.955 --> 34:06.356
and l think about you and me
in the future and all that.

34:06.391 --> 34:07.358
You do?

34:07.392 --> 34:08.552
Mm-hmm.

34:08.594 --> 34:11.893
l'd have to stop thinking
that way,

34:11.929 --> 34:13.556
if l couldn't trust you.

34:13.599 --> 34:15.396
Well, you can.

34:15.434 --> 34:17.425
Good.

34:20.639 --> 34:22.607
You know, Kelly,

34:22.641 --> 34:24.768
there aren't many people

34:24.810 --> 34:27.802
that you can imagine spending
your whole life with.

34:29.648 --> 34:33.014
To me, you're that person.

34:33.051 --> 34:36.885
l mean, l know we're still young
and everything, but l...

35:05.517 --> 35:08.452
Well, Val, thanks
for the lift.

35:08.520 --> 35:10.988
Well, if you ever need
my services again,

35:11.023 --> 35:12.320
you, uh, let
me know.

35:12.357 --> 35:13.585
l'll do that.

35:13.625 --> 35:14.853
You know, it's nice

35:14.893 --> 35:16.451
to be on fairly decent
terms with you.

35:16.561 --> 35:18.188
Oh, hell, we just have
a little problem

35:18.230 --> 35:20.630
letting drugs and money
come between us, that's all.

35:20.666 --> 35:21.633
Despite all that's
happened,

35:21.667 --> 35:24.033
you're still one of
my best friends.

35:24.069 --> 35:26.128
Best friends?

35:26.171 --> 35:28.162
l was thinking, uh,

35:28.206 --> 35:30.174
l've missed you.

35:30.208 --> 35:33.177
And l was thinking
how this is pretty good

35:33.211 --> 35:36.180
with this thing
being platonic.

35:36.214 --> 35:38.182
Well, l could live
with that.

35:38.216 --> 35:40.184
Good.

35:40.218 --> 35:42.186
Even though l'd
rather not.

35:42.220 --> 35:44.211
Bad.

35:45.524 --> 35:47.515
That's real bad.

35:52.030 --> 35:53.998
No, l think

35:54.032 --> 35:57.490
if you are the one to get broken
up with, you forever

35:57.569 --> 35:58.797
have a thing
for that person.

35:58.837 --> 35:59.804
-Oh, yeah?
-Uh-huh.

35:59.838 --> 36:02.136
Even if breaking up was
the best thing to do?

36:02.174 --> 36:03.436
Mm-hmm.
l don't know,

36:03.508 --> 36:05.203
maybe it's, uh, pride,

36:05.243 --> 36:08.269
or the intrigue of the road
never traveled,

36:08.313 --> 36:10.440
but l think if you
get deserted,

36:10.482 --> 36:13.713
somewhere in your head
you'll always want them back.

36:15.721 --> 36:17.348
ls that the way it was with you
and Emily Valentine?

36:17.389 --> 36:18.378
Not quite.

36:18.423 --> 36:19.390
No.

36:19.424 --> 36:20.823
Come on, Brandon,

36:20.859 --> 36:21.985
fess up.

36:22.027 --> 36:23.392
Was it something more?

36:23.428 --> 36:26.397
Okay, l guess...

36:26.431 --> 36:29.059
there was something more

36:29.101 --> 36:31.934
than just an old flame coming
into town.

36:31.970 --> 36:33.437
Well, what is it, then?

36:33.472 --> 36:35.064
Let me put it to
you this way:

36:35.107 --> 36:38.076
Emily came to town, she, uh...

36:38.110 --> 36:40.772
she got under my skin.

36:42.080 --> 36:43.274
So, Kelly

36:43.315 --> 36:44.714
had a right to be worried.

36:44.750 --> 36:46.377
No, but,

36:46.418 --> 36:48.477
until that time,
l didn't know it was possible

36:48.587 --> 36:50.248
to love two people
at the same time.

36:50.288 --> 36:51.414
Sure.

36:51.456 --> 36:53.424
When you go from relationship
to relationship

36:53.458 --> 36:54.720
there's overlap time.

36:54.760 --> 36:57.228
l guess that means Kelly
still loves Dylan, huh?

36:57.262 --> 36:58.923
Well, according
to Clare's theory,

36:58.964 --> 37:01.296
he probably still loves her.

37:01.333 --> 37:04.097
Yeah, kinda like the way
l still care about Celeste,

37:04.136 --> 37:07.435
and though l hate to admit it,
Valerie.

37:07.472 --> 37:09.440
Geez, when you
add up all

37:09.508 --> 37:11.135
the women l still
pine for, it ranks

37:11.176 --> 37:13.201
right up there with all
the other L.A. disasters, huh?

37:15.614 --> 37:18.014
Would you put Kelly
on that list?

37:19.050 --> 37:21.018
lf Kelly would
take me back,

37:21.052 --> 37:22.849
l'd go in a second.

37:25.290 --> 37:27.451
l can't believe we're telling
each other these things.

37:27.492 --> 37:28.891
Blame it on the watermelon.

37:28.927 --> 37:29.894
Yes!

37:29.928 --> 37:30.895
Hey!

37:30.929 --> 37:32.658
You haven't told us
anything yet.

37:32.697 --> 37:34.187
-Come on.
-Yeah.

37:34.232 --> 37:35.859
Spill your guts, blondie.

37:35.901 --> 37:37.459
What?

37:37.502 --> 37:39.265
-What do you want me to say?
-We want

37:39.304 --> 37:40.862
to know about your demons.

37:40.906 --> 37:43.101
Okay. Um...

37:43.141 --> 37:46.133
l guess
my biggest fear

37:46.178 --> 37:49.306
is that being a virgin

37:49.347 --> 37:52.475
will cost me every relationship
that l have.

37:52.517 --> 37:55.281
The way it did with David.

37:58.590 --> 38:00.353
Look, Donna,
if l haven't said it

38:00.392 --> 38:01.825
in so many words before,
l, uh...

38:01.860 --> 38:02.827
David,

38:02.861 --> 38:04.829
you don't have to say it.

38:04.863 --> 38:06.330
l know.

38:24.749 --> 38:26.717
l've got a headache.

38:26.751 --> 38:29.549
No surprise
there.

38:29.588 --> 38:31.215
Why?

38:31.256 --> 38:34.157
Maybe it's a
hangover?

38:34.192 --> 38:35.557
Oh, no, no, no, no.

38:35.594 --> 38:37.619
Don't tell me
you don't remember last night?

38:37.662 --> 38:40.130
l remember...

38:40.165 --> 38:42.963
filming Clare and David's thing

38:43.001 --> 38:45.697
and having a few of Steve's
watermelon cubes.

38:45.737 --> 38:47.830
A few too many.

38:47.873 --> 38:49.841
Really?

38:51.343 --> 38:52.776
Fill me in on the details.

38:52.811 --> 38:56.110
Well, let me see, what
can l tell you?

38:56.147 --> 39:00.277
You were the typical
life-of-the-party drunk, Kel.

39:00.318 --> 39:03.287
Lampshade on the head,
dancing on the tables.

39:03.321 --> 39:04.948
Then all these sailors showed up

39:04.990 --> 39:06.958
and you did a striptease,
it was great.

39:06.992 --> 39:08.619
Was that right before

39:08.660 --> 39:10.992
or right after you told me
the truth about Emily?

39:11.029 --> 39:13.623
l think l better go get you some
aspirin.

39:13.665 --> 39:15.656
One other thing.

39:17.669 --> 39:20.433
Did l happen to go on and on

39:20.505 --> 39:22.439
about how much l love you?

39:22.507 --> 39:25.442
You did kind of let that slip.

39:25.510 --> 39:27.444
l thought so.

39:27.512 --> 39:29.446
Yeah.

39:29.514 --> 39:31.505
Sorry.

39:33.518 --> 39:35.281
Morning, beautiful.

39:35.320 --> 39:36.844
Mmm.

39:36.888 --> 39:37.855
How you doing?

39:37.889 --> 39:38.947
Good.

39:38.990 --> 39:40.457
Oh, l feel like
it's the morning

39:40.558 --> 39:42.355
after my wedding.

39:42.394 --> 39:44.362
Well, l feel even
better than that.

39:44.396 --> 39:46.364
Ah.

39:46.398 --> 39:48.161
Jesse, um...

39:48.199 --> 39:50.759
Jesse, l have to, uh,

39:50.802 --> 39:52.793
talk to you
about something.

39:53.838 --> 39:55.863
What's up?

39:55.907 --> 40:00.105
l've been seeing a therapist
about our marriage.

40:01.813 --> 40:04.441
She's helped me see

40:04.482 --> 40:08.418
how essential honesty is
to our relationship.

40:08.453 --> 40:11.752
l guess, uh, l guess we haven't
had that, have we?

40:11.790 --> 40:14.452
No, we haven't.

40:14.492 --> 40:18.223
l guess l haven't been hiding it
very well, have l?

40:18.263 --> 40:20.595
Hiding what?

40:20.632 --> 40:22.099
l've been climbing the walls
about this,

40:22.133 --> 40:23.600
and right now
more than anything,

40:23.635 --> 40:25.227
l wish l could erase
the whole thing.

40:25.270 --> 40:27.465
Jesse, what are you
talking about?

40:27.505 --> 40:29.632
Do you remember my trip
to Kansas City,

40:29.674 --> 40:32.074
and l told you l'd stayed out
late playing poker

40:32.110 --> 40:34.908
with some of the guys from Judge
Costello's office?

40:34.946 --> 40:36.243
Yeah.

40:36.281 --> 40:37.908
Well, the truth is,
l was having dinner

40:37.949 --> 40:40.417
with a law clerk l met that
afternoon at the interview.

40:40.452 --> 40:43.512
l-l didn't plan on anything more
than that,

40:43.621 --> 40:46.522
that was it.

40:46.624 --> 40:50.424
Then after dinner, l walked her
back to her apartment.

40:50.462 --> 40:52.453
She asked me in.

40:53.598 --> 40:56.158
We ended up in bed.

40:57.202 --> 40:59.193
l'm sorry.

41:00.205 --> 41:03.197
l'm so sorry.

41:12.517 --> 41:14.485
Hey.

41:14.519 --> 41:16.146
Where's everyone?

41:16.187 --> 41:18.712
Well, Brandon and Kelly went
over to the boardwalk.

41:18.757 --> 41:21.885
David and Clare, they're editing
last night's masterpiece.

41:21.926 --> 41:23.894
l wonder how that'll
turn out.

41:23.928 --> 41:25.623
Things got pretty
funky last night.

41:25.663 --> 41:27.062
l don't know,
l kinda dug it.

41:27.098 --> 41:29.066
l like the fact that
reality got a little warped.

41:29.100 --> 41:30.226
All the facades
came down.

41:30.268 --> 41:33.169
Well, we did learn some
revealing things.

41:33.204 --> 41:35.331
Juicy stuff.

41:35.373 --> 41:37.773
l just hope no permanent
damage was done.

41:37.809 --> 41:39.436
Ah, quite the contrary,
Donna.

41:39.477 --> 41:41.604
l think it opened up a whole
world of possibilities.

41:41.646 --> 41:43.614
Like what?

41:43.648 --> 41:46.276
Like how about you and l play
house this afternoon?

41:46.317 --> 41:47.784
Steve!

41:47.819 --> 41:49.286
What?

41:49.320 --> 41:51.311
The party's over.

41:54.759 --> 41:57.751
Can't blame a guy
for asking, right?

41:57.796 --> 41:59.696
l can't believe my life
sometimes.

41:59.731 --> 42:01.358
-My ex-girlfriend and
l haven't been... -Oh, okay,

42:01.399 --> 42:02.923
this was great stuff.
We've got to use this.

42:02.967 --> 42:05.162
Yeah, but that's not ''Todd'',
that's really Steve.

42:05.203 --> 42:07.330
The name of the essay
is ''Real Life''.

42:07.372 --> 42:09.169
The best material
we have is

42:09.207 --> 42:10.834
when people stepped
out of their roles.

42:10.875 --> 42:12.172
Like this.

42:12.210 --> 42:14.474
-My spineless...
-We're gonna get marked down

42:14.546 --> 42:16.104
for not using the
original characters.

42:16.147 --> 42:17.614
No, we won't, we'll
just explain

42:17.649 --> 42:19.674
that the project took
on a life of its own,

42:19.717 --> 42:21.685
and developed into something
even better.

42:21.719 --> 42:23.687
lt's fine by me.

42:23.721 --> 42:25.689
l'm not the grade
junkie.

42:25.723 --> 42:28.715
ls there a problem
with that?

42:29.928 --> 42:32.089
Look out.

42:32.130 --> 42:33.427
No.

42:33.465 --> 42:34.796
But there's something wrong
with that.

42:34.833 --> 42:36.130
What?

42:36.167 --> 42:37.896
l was just playing a role.

42:37.936 --> 42:39.494
lt wasn't in the script.

42:39.537 --> 42:40.834
Really?

42:40.872 --> 42:42.396
Well, guess what, David?

42:42.440 --> 42:43.737
Neither was

42:43.775 --> 42:45.402
this...

42:45.443 --> 42:47.411
You know what?

42:47.445 --> 42:49.242
You're way out
of line.

42:49.280 --> 42:50.474
l'm out of line?

42:50.515 --> 42:51.846
You didn't even try
to disguise this

42:51.883 --> 42:53.077
behind the roles
you were playing!

42:53.118 --> 42:54.517
Excuse me, for your information,

42:54.619 --> 42:56.211
Donna and l were talking
about the fact

42:56.254 --> 42:57.846
she was almost raped
a few weeks ago.

42:57.889 --> 43:00.187
Please, David, don't insult
my intelligence here, all right?

43:00.225 --> 43:01.556
You admitted
in front of everybody

43:01.593 --> 43:02.787
you're still in love with her.

43:02.827 --> 43:04.454
Oh, well, gee,
you sure didn't hesitate

43:04.529 --> 43:06.224
to tell everyone
that you still want Brandon.

43:06.264 --> 43:08.027
Of course you really didn't
have to say anything about it,

43:08.066 --> 43:09.465
it's kind of obvious with
the way you flirt.

43:09.567 --> 43:11.194
l do not!

43:11.236 --> 43:12.726
What do you think l am, stupid?

43:12.770 --> 43:14.237
You do it right
underneath my nose.

43:14.272 --> 43:16.069
Yeah,

43:16.107 --> 43:18.200
l do think you're pretty stupid
sometimes.

43:20.245 --> 43:23.146
Yeah, well, uh,
l guess anyone who's not

43:23.181 --> 43:25.479
a rocket scientist
is stupid to you.

43:25.583 --> 43:27.983
Well, l expect a lot
from people.

43:28.019 --> 43:30.579
You know what, Clare?

43:30.622 --> 43:33.113
Why don't we just do something
really smart here?

43:34.225 --> 43:35.624
Let's just end this.

43:35.660 --> 43:37.958
Just like that?

43:37.996 --> 43:39.964
Yeah.

43:39.998 --> 43:41.295
Yeah, just like that.

43:41.332 --> 43:44.267
Fine by me.

43:50.141 --> 43:52.735
Me, too.
