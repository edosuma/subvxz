11:16.385 --> 11:17.969
Ha!

11:18.011 --> 11:19.846
Never. You know me.

11:19.888 --> 11:21.515
- Well...
- We can't start

11:21.556 --> 11:23.266
this meeting without Pitzer.
Try him again.

11:23.308 --> 11:25.769
Sorry, dude. I got to go.

11:25.811 --> 11:27.187
Wait...

11:28.688 --> 11:30.690
Damn it.

11:38.281 --> 11:39.801
Anyway, I told him
the dividends weren't there.

11:39.825 --> 11:41.743
I kept telling him that.
He wouldn't believe me.

11:41.785 --> 11:44.037
And now he's spending money
instead of making it.

11:44.079 --> 11:45.539
What an idiot.

11:45.580 --> 11:47.165
This is so good.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.167
Mmm. Ow!

11:49.209 --> 11:50.585
What?!

11:50.627 --> 11:52.170
Honey, that's a bone.

11:52.212 --> 11:55.382
The animal that chicken
comes from has them.

11:55.424 --> 11:58.385
I knew that.
I just never bit one.

11:58.427 --> 12:00.554
Why don't you try
swallowing them whole?

12:00.595 --> 12:02.389
There's candy on the inside.

12:02.431 --> 12:06.476
Ruby, not everyone can afford
unprinted food.

12:06.518 --> 12:07.519
How's work, Dad?

12:07.561 --> 12:08.520
Well, the merger shouldn't

12:08.562 --> 12:09.563
really affect much.

12:09.604 --> 12:11.164
If we come to terms
with the divestment,

12:11.189 --> 12:12.691
it will be smooth sailing.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.151
I'm sorry
if I'm losing you, Ingrid.

12:14.192 --> 12:17.195
I tried to dumb it down
as much as I could.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.655
Oh, no, I'm following fine.

12:18.697 --> 12:20.782
- It's just not interesting.
- Uh-huh.

12:20.824 --> 12:22.552
So I ran into Carter
in Venice the other day,

12:22.576 --> 12:24.202
and he was asking about you.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.663
- Hmm.
- You know he's divorced now,
right?

12:26.705 --> 12:28.707
So another option maybe,
if you lose a few.

12:28.748 --> 12:31.585
You know he gave Gwen HPV,
right?

12:31.626 --> 12:33.003
And I'm with Nathan.

12:33.044 --> 12:34.629
Oh, we know.

12:34.671 --> 12:36.131
Are there bones in this, too?

12:36.173 --> 12:37.716
- No, sweetie.
- Oh.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.843
I understand Nathan
is a neighbor of David Choak.

12:39.885 --> 12:41.696
Maybe he'll finally
learn something about business.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.638
- Uploads still
can't work, Daddy.

12:43.680 --> 12:46.475
- Oh.
- Did you get your Horizen bill
this month?

12:46.516 --> 12:48.143
How much is he costing you?

12:48.185 --> 12:50.520
Mm. Less than you spend
on Botox, Mom.

12:50.562 --> 12:52.689
You mean less
than I spend on her Botox?

12:52.731 --> 12:54.917
Well, if you didn't pay the
bills, what good would you be?

12:54.941 --> 12:57.235
Do you guys always talk
to each other like this?

12:57.277 --> 12:59.404
- Like how?
- Crazy mean.

12:59.446 --> 13:02.032
Huh. I guess we do.

13:02.073 --> 13:03.325
It's kind of fun, right?

13:07.037 --> 13:08.872
For real, though,
children are the future.

13:08.914 --> 13:10.582
I volunteer
at the Y on weekends,

13:10.624 --> 13:13.126
teaching kids
and inspiring them.

13:13.168 --> 13:15.462
What do you...
what do you teach them?

13:15.504 --> 13:18.381
If you see something you want,
anything,

13:18.423 --> 13:22.385
don't let anyone tell you
that you can't have it.

13:22.427 --> 13:24.346
What...?

13:24.387 --> 13:27.182
What if it belongs
to another kid?

13:27.224 --> 13:29.851
Yeah, then I just tell them,
"Do not be a Beta."

13:31.561 --> 13:33.271
Be an Alpha.

13:39.736 --> 13:41.363
Oh.

13:41.404 --> 13:43.990
Thanks for coming by
to check in on me, Nathan.

13:44.032 --> 13:47.327
Having a cold is no fun.

13:47.369 --> 13:48.870
Why are you paying extra
for this?

13:48.912 --> 13:50.330
Isn't it, like,
a dollar a minute?

13:50.372 --> 13:52.916
Well, when you've been here
a little longer,

13:52.958 --> 13:56.294
you'll see that having no fun
can be kind of fun.

13:56.336 --> 13:59.256
My nose is actually stuffed up,
just like real life.

14:00.715 --> 14:02.425
Zach, you want some honey
in your tea?

14:02.467 --> 14:04.052
Yes, please.

14:04.094 --> 14:05.720
- Here you go.
- Oh.

14:05.762 --> 14:08.557
- Oh, yes.
- Aw, poor thing.

14:12.310 --> 14:14.187
Um, could you?

14:15.814 --> 14:18.275
Geez.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.114
Spit 'em out!

14:24.155 --> 14:25.699
What? Occupied!

14:25.740 --> 14:27.492
Cease crunching!

14:27.534 --> 14:28.994
Fuck you!

14:29.035 --> 14:33.206
Thank you! My "fingers
and dicks" file is bulging.

14:33.248 --> 14:34.624
When do you start taking dicks?

14:34.666 --> 14:36.167
When there's no more fingers.

14:37.752 --> 14:41.131
What about toes?
You're skipping toes!

14:41.172 --> 14:43.883
Nathan's your uncle, right?
Mommy says

14:43.925 --> 14:45.645
- he's nothing but a sponge.
- I don't think

14:45.677 --> 14:47.721
she can hear you with all
that chewing she's doing.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.851
- We have an eater.
- So, Nevaeh, what's the plan?

14:52.892 --> 14:54.870
How are you gonna grow up
to be successful so you can eat

14:54.894 --> 14:56.896
- like this every night?
- I don't know.

14:56.938 --> 14:58.648
- "I don't know"?
- Just like our Ingrid.

14:58.690 --> 15:01.526
Talks with her mouth full
and doesn't have a future.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.570
At least I'm not an old bitch.

15:03.612 --> 15:06.573
I'm in sales, guys,
and doing well.

15:06.615 --> 15:09.492
- We'll see how that sticks.
- I'm sure Nathan hopes it does.

15:09.534 --> 15:12.162
Okay, who's ready for dessert?

15:12.203 --> 15:14.539
I made crème caramel.

15:14.581 --> 15:17.292
- Oh.
- Ew. No, thank you.

15:17.334 --> 15:20.128
No.

15:22.213 --> 15:23.632
Yeah, I'll have some.

15:24.966 --> 15:26.926
This whole dinner
was really amazing.

15:26.968 --> 15:30.972
Thanks, Nevaeh.
It's nice to be appreciated.

15:31.014 --> 15:32.599
You can give mine
to the little piggy.

15:34.684 --> 15:37.187
Okay, you know what?
Get out.

15:38.730 --> 15:41.274
- Please leave!
- What?

15:41.316 --> 15:42.859
All of you out my door now!

15:42.901 --> 15:44.903
Let Nevaeh and I start
our sleepover.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.447
- Go! Go!
- Daddy, listen to how
she's talking to us.

15:48.823 --> 15:50.992
- Oh, no.
- Get out.

15:51.034 --> 15:54.162
Who's the bitch now, Ingrid?

15:59.084 --> 16:01.086
Let's do our hair the same.

16:02.545 --> 16:04.839
Okay, for real, though,
aren't you scared

16:04.881 --> 16:07.092
- of working with ghosts?
- Stop calling them ghosts.

16:07.133 --> 16:09.969
- They're not ghosts.
- But they're not alive, right?

16:10.011 --> 16:11.513
They're not dead, either.

16:11.554 --> 16:13.515
You know, I've given this
a lot of thought.

16:13.556 --> 16:15.016
And some
of the best conversations

16:15.058 --> 16:16.643
I've ever had are...

16:16.685 --> 16:19.020
It's on me. Yes!

16:19.062 --> 16:21.690
Boom. Alpha.

16:21.731 --> 16:24.359
Oh. Thanks.

16:24.401 --> 16:27.153
So, where to next?

16:27.195 --> 16:31.116
Uh, you mean your place or mine?

16:31.157 --> 16:34.953
No, like,
more of the talking part?

16:34.994 --> 16:36.913
Do you think

16:36.955 --> 16:39.791
that maybe sex could be hot
later if we knew each other?

16:41.126 --> 16:42.335
Like, it would make it

16:42.377 --> 16:43.795
more interesting somehow?

16:43.837 --> 16:45.755
I don't know.
I sound like a complete pervert.

16:45.797 --> 16:48.133
No, that's...

16:48.174 --> 16:50.260
That sounds nice.

16:51.636 --> 16:53.012
I think it's cool

16:53.054 --> 16:54.889
you want to learn more about me.

16:54.931 --> 16:57.142
Okay, now you're making me sound
like a real creep.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.018
No.

17:00.270 --> 17:02.981
Ugh.

17:03.022 --> 17:03.982
Gordita Crunch?

17:04.023 --> 17:05.567
First one's free!

17:05.608 --> 17:07.402
- No.
- Are you sure?

17:07.444 --> 17:09.446
- Yes.
- Yes to the Gordita Crunch?

17:09.487 --> 17:11.781
- No.
- No, you're not sure?

17:11.823 --> 17:14.492
- Yes.
- All right. Get your crunch on!

17:14.534 --> 17:16.536
Wha... I... no...

17:18.037 --> 17:20.790
Ice-cold.

17:20.832 --> 17:22.917
Angel?

17:22.959 --> 17:24.711
Oh, never mind.

17:24.753 --> 17:26.880
Dude.

17:30.633 --> 17:33.678
Dream on, Mittens.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.306
You know you can get 'em back
if you just say "sorry."

17:36.347 --> 17:38.558
Fine. I'm sorry
you're such a fart.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.059
Okay.

17:41.686 --> 17:43.521
Dude, did you just...?

17:43.563 --> 17:46.566
- Yup.
- Angel supervisor?

17:46.608 --> 17:48.169
Wait. No, no, no.
I can fix it. I can fix it.

17:48.193 --> 17:50.737
Here you go.

17:52.238 --> 17:53.740
Balls below, please.

17:53.782 --> 17:55.074
Thank you.

17:56.743 --> 17:59.245
Hi.

17:59.287 --> 18:01.706
Uh, sir, is this angel
forcing you

18:01.748 --> 18:04.542
to do something
you don't want to do?

18:04.584 --> 18:06.544
No. No, no.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.421
Let me see your hands.

18:10.965 --> 18:12.801
Where are his fingers?!

18:12.842 --> 18:15.428
Angel, goddamn it!
This is a fireable offense.

18:15.470 --> 18:21.392
Wait. I won't press charges
if she says she's sorry.

18:22.977 --> 18:25.522
Me apologize?

18:25.563 --> 18:27.649
N... that's too far.

18:27.690 --> 18:30.151
Apologize to the client, angel.

18:30.193 --> 18:33.196
He is being very reasonable!

18:33.238 --> 18:35.406
He... I... What?!

18:35.448 --> 18:37.575
He... You...

18:37.617 --> 18:39.452
You're the... I... I...

18:39.494 --> 18:41.454
Gotcha!

18:41.496 --> 18:42.997
Don't worry about it.
We're cool.

18:43.039 --> 18:44.582
It's just a game we play.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.709
Busting each others' balls.

18:48.586 --> 18:51.214
- For real?
- Yeah, I got it from the Army.

18:51.256 --> 18:53.299
We always fucked
with each other. Good times.

18:53.341 --> 18:55.635
This angel's cool.
If you got some kind of

18:55.677 --> 18:57.804
Employee of the Month thing...

18:57.846 --> 19:00.014
No, we don't.
We don't do that.

19:00.056 --> 19:02.392
I mean, you could tip her.

19:02.433 --> 19:05.019
Mm... nah.

19:05.061 --> 19:07.647
No, I wouldn't, either.

19:07.689 --> 19:10.358
What is that muscle
from there to there?

19:10.400 --> 19:13.027
- There. Yeah.
- That? Oh. Trapezius.

19:13.069 --> 19:14.946
I like it.

19:14.988 --> 19:16.966
- I cannot figure you out.
- Figure me out, can you?

19:16.990 --> 19:19.033
Here.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.664
Thanks. And don't worry.

19:24.706 --> 19:28.459
I won this battle,
but you will also lose the war.

19:28.501 --> 19:29.961
We'll see.

19:33.464 --> 19:34.799
Oh, fuck.

19:37.135 --> 19:39.137
Whoa!

19:39.178 --> 19:41.556
- This is it.
- Wow. This is dope.

19:41.598 --> 19:43.850
- Hey.
- Hey. Is Lucy still here?

19:43.892 --> 19:47.604
Oh, she just left.
And I live to angel another day.

19:47.645 --> 19:49.939
- Who is this?
- What's up?

19:49.981 --> 19:51.649
I am Byron, her date.

19:51.691 --> 19:54.152
He wanted to see where I worked.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.779
Wow. Crazy night.

19:56.821 --> 19:58.239
Okay.

19:58.281 --> 20:00.033
Well, you two have fun.

20:00.074 --> 20:02.118
Yeah.

20:05.371 --> 20:06.915
Fuck on Lucy's table.

20:09.042 --> 20:12.337
Um, uh, well, this is my desk.

20:12.378 --> 20:14.672
Ooh, this is wild.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.674
Can I, can I see one?

20:16.716 --> 20:19.177
I mean,
they're probably all asleep.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.304
Oh, what about this guy?

20:21.346 --> 20:23.097
Looks like he's up.

20:23.139 --> 20:24.515
Uh...

20:27.769 --> 20:29.479
Okay.

20:34.359 --> 20:35.610
Whoa.

20:35.652 --> 20:37.612
He looks so real.

20:37.654 --> 20:39.322
He is real.

20:39.364 --> 20:41.866
Look, he's doing
a little painting.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.326
It's like,

20:43.368 --> 20:45.244
"Dude, why? You're dead."

20:45.286 --> 20:47.789
Dead man painting.

20:47.830 --> 20:50.541
Wait, can you print that out?

20:50.583 --> 20:53.252
'Cause I would love
to put that on my fridge.

20:53.294 --> 20:55.546
Okay, so you have
a really weird job.

20:55.588 --> 20:56.547
Would you like to
get out of here

20:56.589 --> 20:57.548
and go back to my place?

20:57.590 --> 20:59.175
Actually, I just realized,

20:59.217 --> 21:01.803
I'm so behind on work stuff,

21:01.844 --> 21:04.847
so I think I'm gonna stay here

21:04.889 --> 21:07.058
and just try to
get through some of it.

21:07.100 --> 21:08.476
Rain check?

21:09.811 --> 21:11.813
- Okay.
- Okay.

21:18.194 --> 21:19.254
It was nice getting
to know you, Norma.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.489
- Oh...
- And I know your name's Nora.

21:21.531 --> 21:23.783
That's a nickname.
I added the "mmm"

21:23.825 --> 21:26.327
because you're "mmm-mmm" good.

21:26.369 --> 21:27.662
I'll see you later.

21:37.922 --> 21:39.424
Needs more Tokyo blue.

21:39.465 --> 21:42.010
Don't look at it,
it's not finished.

21:43.177 --> 21:45.179
How was your date?

21:45.221 --> 21:49.267
Well, it's 10:30,
and I'm at work, so...

21:49.308 --> 21:51.477
So, really good.

21:53.896 --> 21:56.000
Hey, I've been meaning to ask,
what's your office look like?

21:56.024 --> 22:00.820
Well, it's a lot of brick,
some linoleum.

22:00.862 --> 22:02.947
Wow, I feel like I'm there.

22:02.989 --> 22:05.158
You should write novels.

22:05.199 --> 22:06.200
What do you want from me?

22:06.242 --> 22:07.326
It's an office.

22:07.368 --> 22:10.455
I mean, what a weird question.

22:14.500 --> 22:15.710
Pick it up.

22:17.837 --> 22:18.921
- Hello?
- Hey.

22:18.963 --> 22:21.174
Who is this?!
How'd you get this number?!

22:25.928 --> 22:30.224
Well, as you can see,
the office is deserted.

22:30.266 --> 22:32.185
So, if you said "angel now,"

22:32.226 --> 22:35.021
you would get an outsourced one
from Finland

22:35.063 --> 22:36.105
or Kenya.

22:36.147 --> 22:38.399
Hmm. Where's your desk?

22:38.441 --> 22:40.610
Uh, this is...

22:40.651 --> 22:41.986
where I work.

22:42.028 --> 22:43.654
And Aleesha sits next to me.

22:43.696 --> 22:44.739
Uh, wait. Who?

22:44.781 --> 22:47.158
Oh, shit, uh,

22:47.200 --> 22:50.036
that's the tall one's name.

22:50.078 --> 22:52.371
Luke's angel.

22:52.413 --> 22:54.290
Wait, who's that?

22:54.332 --> 22:56.375
That's my ex-husband, Carl.

22:56.417 --> 22:58.211
- What?
- He gets out of prison
next month.

22:58.252 --> 22:59.337
Oh.

22:59.378 --> 23:01.422
Kidding. It's my dad.

23:03.591 --> 23:07.095
My boss works up there...

23:07.136 --> 23:09.180
and that's the break room
through there.

23:09.222 --> 23:11.432
It's pretty shitty.

23:13.059 --> 23:14.435
It's fantastic.

23:14.477 --> 23:16.270
Wait, what?

23:16.312 --> 23:19.941
The real world.
It's amazing.

23:19.982 --> 23:22.151
Okay, please.

23:29.325 --> 23:33.621
This... is amazing.

23:39.710 --> 23:41.587
Beautiful.

23:45.174 --> 23:47.260
We never get to see
the stars in L.A.

23:47.301 --> 23:49.720
'cause of all the light
pollution.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.305
Same in New York.

23:53.349 --> 23:55.351
It's nice we get to
see them here.

23:57.770 --> 24:00.815
Mint chip is the best, huh?

24:00.857 --> 24:01.983
Mm-hmm.

24:02.024 --> 24:04.819
That was Nathan's favorite.

24:07.071 --> 24:08.489
I really miss him.

24:08.531 --> 24:12.535
I know. Me, too.

24:14.662 --> 24:16.539
Here.

24:18.040 --> 24:19.876
I have a surprise.

24:21.210 --> 24:22.211
I'll be right back.

24:27.091 --> 24:29.468
This is for you.

24:36.434 --> 24:37.727
It was his.

24:39.312 --> 24:42.148
I snuck back into his car
the night that he died

24:42.190 --> 24:45.526
to turn on
"Prioritize Occupant."

24:45.568 --> 24:47.486
Not that it made any difference.

24:49.488 --> 24:52.241
Anyway...

24:52.283 --> 24:54.827
I grabbed it so I could wear it
on the way home.

24:54.869 --> 24:59.498
And I, uh...
I want you to have it.

25:04.712 --> 25:08.507
Do you think Nathan's lonely?

25:08.549 --> 25:11.552
I'd be so lonely.

25:23.606 --> 25:28.527
Hey, can I tell you a secret?

25:28.569 --> 25:30.571
You have to promise to keep it,

25:30.613 --> 25:32.698
'cause it could get me
in a lot of trouble.

25:32.740 --> 25:34.242
Yeah, of course.

25:34.283 --> 25:36.285
But, I mean,
is it really a secret

25:36.327 --> 25:39.413
if they record all our
conversations anyway?

25:39.455 --> 25:42.541
They can't record everything.
You have to turn a button on.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.796
But just in case.

25:49.382 --> 25:51.092
It's about your memories.

25:51.133 --> 25:53.636
I found out

25:53.678 --> 25:56.389
they were damaged
after your scan.

25:56.430 --> 25:57.807
And some of them

25:57.848 --> 26:00.518
were deleted from my computer
after I took them home.

26:00.559 --> 26:01.811
You took them home?

26:01.852 --> 26:03.896
So I could try and fix them.

26:03.938 --> 26:05.189
What'd you find?

26:05.231 --> 26:06.750
You were about to sell
something called

26:06.774 --> 26:09.986
"Beyond" with a friend, Jamie.

26:10.027 --> 26:13.698
And you disagreed
about selling it.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.866
Does any of this ring a bell?

26:15.908 --> 26:18.494
I mean, a little.

26:18.536 --> 26:22.039
I think...

26:22.081 --> 26:25.167
I think what happened to you
wasn't an accident.

26:28.546 --> 26:32.508
Yeah, David Choak thinks
I was murdered.

26:32.550 --> 26:35.761
That whatever I was working on
was big.

26:35.803 --> 26:38.889
I mean, is it possible
Jamie did something to my car?

26:38.931 --> 26:41.517
Everyone says that
self-driving cars don't crash,

26:41.559 --> 26:45.313
but... I mean,
that's crazy, right?

26:46.981 --> 26:49.900
I don't know.

26:49.942 --> 26:53.571
But it all seems really freaky.

26:57.158 --> 26:58.176
Hey, let's change the subject.

26:58.200 --> 27:01.037
- Okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

27:01.078 --> 27:03.331
Yeah.

27:03.372 --> 27:07.460
Yeah, maybe something
non-murder related.

27:09.003 --> 27:11.047
Whatcha got?

27:15.301 --> 27:16.844
You're my favorite person here.

27:18.888 --> 27:20.681
Yeah.

27:20.723 --> 27:25.644
We, uh, have
a really nice friendship.

27:25.686 --> 27:28.022
I just...

27:28.064 --> 27:30.733
I feel more optimistic
when you're around.

27:30.775 --> 27:34.487
I'm really glad
you came back tonight.

27:34.528 --> 27:36.822
Not that...

27:36.864 --> 27:39.116
not that I was rooting
for your date to fail,

27:39.158 --> 27:41.160
but I'm being honest.

27:41.202 --> 27:43.537
I did get a little jealous.

27:48.042 --> 27:49.585
You okay?

27:54.382 --> 27:55.883
You know, for an L.A. douchebag,

27:55.925 --> 27:59.095
you're the best L.A. douchebag
I've ever met.

27:59.136 --> 28:02.223
Yeah? How many others you met?

28:02.264 --> 28:04.850
You're my one and only.

28:26.539 --> 28:28.707
Wake up, ho!

28:29.750 --> 28:31.502
Nora!

28:31.544 --> 28:33.337
What the fuck?!
