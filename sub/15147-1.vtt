00:57.824 --> 01:01.021
Alex, is that ten grand
or are you just happy to see me?

01:01.094 --> 01:03.528
It's there.
Let's go.

01:06.499 --> 01:09.696
How did a bonehead like Wolf
wind up in the fight ring...

01:09.769 --> 01:11.964
with Minoso Torres?

01:12.038 --> 01:16.236
Word is Wolf stepped in on a beef
Torres had with Gabriel Caine.

01:16.309 --> 01:19.472
Caine's too smart
to get on Torres' bad side...

01:19.546 --> 01:21.480
unless he had a reason
for getting there.

01:22.282 --> 01:24.273
Find him.

01:39.466 --> 01:40.899
Wait here.

01:48.408 --> 01:51.070
It's there. Let's go.

02:40.460 --> 02:42.724
- Put this on.
- Fuck you.

02:42.795 --> 02:45.389
Put this on or I'll break your glasses
and feed you to Lester in D block...

02:45.465 --> 02:46.898
you little gerbil.

02:54.140 --> 02:56.074
- Right over the grate.
- What grate?

02:56.142 --> 02:58.235
- Just keep crawling.
- Hot! Jesus!

02:58.311 --> 03:00.711
- Good.
- Damn!

03:00.780 --> 03:04.011
- Stop.
- Can I take it off now?

03:04.083 --> 03:07.018
You could, but if you do the man
on the other side will kill you.

03:07.086 --> 03:09.179
If you show
a certain degree of wisdom...

03:09.255 --> 03:11.189
he'll put you on a boat,
take you across the lake...

03:11.257 --> 03:14.055
pick you up in a car and then drive you
across the state line.

03:14.127 --> 03:15.856
Whatever you decide to do,
please do so with haste.

03:15.929 --> 03:17.521
- What is it?
- Yeah.

03:18.765 --> 03:21.029
You're going outside.

03:21.100 --> 03:23.466
The showers won't be the same
without you.

03:40.954 --> 03:42.888
Get up!

03:59.472 --> 04:01.667
Get your fat ass up!

04:19.459 --> 04:22.360
Don't you know you're not
supposed to smoke in bed?

04:22.428 --> 04:24.089
Gabe.

04:24.163 --> 04:26.188
You want to say good night
to your little sister...

04:26.266 --> 04:28.860
and your ugly dogs in Diggstown?

04:28.935 --> 04:30.869
Thanks.

04:32.939 --> 04:34.998
You're a good friend.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.210
I don't know, Wolf.

04:39.779 --> 04:42.145
I never should have
let you fight Torres.

04:42.215 --> 04:44.479
Arert you gonna
sing and dance with him?

04:47.954 --> 04:49.683
It did do the trick, though.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.385
- So you're here to cheer me up.
- Yeah.

04:54.460 --> 04:57.896
You're gonna make me
a rich man, right?

04:58.965 --> 05:00.694
That I am.

05:00.767 --> 05:03.736
So you're a good friend.

05:03.803 --> 05:06.363
Maybe the best I ever had.

05:06.439 --> 05:10.808
Nobody ever took the time
to teach somebody like me.

05:10.877 --> 05:14.506
And nobody
ever gave me a chance...

05:14.580 --> 05:17.242
to make the kind of money
we made today.

05:18.418 --> 05:22.514
So you're a good friend, okay?

05:23.589 --> 05:25.489
Get some rest, partner.

05:25.558 --> 05:27.025
Yeah.

05:28.695 --> 05:31.186
In the 18 years
I've been running Winfield...

05:31.264 --> 05:33.289
there have only been
six escapes.

05:33.366 --> 05:35.698
Five of them
since you arrived here.

05:35.768 --> 05:39.864
Like little old Alex Dupree
who disappeared last night.

05:42.041 --> 05:44.373
What do you think about that,
Mr. Caine?

05:44.444 --> 05:48.813
I think the important thing is not
to take it as a personal rejection.

05:56.789 --> 05:59.553
Warden, I owe you an apology.

05:59.625 --> 06:02.822
Guys said your clip was full of blanks,
but I didn't know they meant your gun.

06:02.895 --> 06:04.920
I don't carry blanks.

06:06.966 --> 06:09.491
God, that was clumsy of me.

06:09.569 --> 06:12.470
Scared me.
Did it scare you?

06:13.906 --> 06:15.430
You're smart, Caine.

06:15.508 --> 06:19.000
How did they catch
a boy as smart as you?

06:19.078 --> 06:21.171
Let's just say you might want
to change careers...

06:21.247 --> 06:24.182
and sell phony art
to rich people.

06:24.250 --> 06:29.210
Make sure your painter doesn't use
acrylics on 18th-century landscapes.

06:29.288 --> 06:31.279
I'll remember that.

06:31.357 --> 06:33.018
I will.

06:33.092 --> 06:35.185
And you remember this:

06:35.261 --> 06:37.195
I'll find out
how you've been doing it...

06:37.263 --> 06:39.925
before you're released
next week.

06:39.999 --> 06:44.129
- Keith.
- So this means Club Med is out?

06:50.209 --> 06:53.372
- Jesus. What if they find the tunnel?
- So what?

06:53.446 --> 06:55.812
- You think I left my name on it?
- I don't know.

06:57.784 --> 06:59.217
Queen.

06:59.285 --> 07:01.981
What are the chances
of another queen?

07:02.054 --> 07:06.150
Two showing, ten cards down?
Looks like two out of forty to me.

07:06.225 --> 07:08.090
Unless, of course...

07:08.161 --> 07:09.685
Son of a bitch!

07:09.762 --> 07:13.163
Unless there's one queen left 'cause
the other one isn't where you put it.

07:14.567 --> 07:16.228
Ten thousand come out okay
with Alex?

07:16.302 --> 07:18.600
Leave it to you
to make 50 grand in jail.

07:18.671 --> 07:21.231
A mere bag of shells,
but it should get us started.

07:21.307 --> 07:23.241
How are those farm boys
looking in Diggstown?

07:23.309 --> 07:25.709
Nothing Roy can't handle.
I've seen them all.

07:25.778 --> 07:27.837
- How's he doing?
- Roy's doing good.

07:27.914 --> 07:30.075
I talked to him.
He's really excited.

07:30.149 --> 07:31.548
- Yeah? Good.
- Yeah.

07:33.986 --> 07:36.216
It's time to set the hook
in Diggstown.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.985
- Do it just like I told you.
- Yeah.

07:39.058 --> 07:41.185
Exactly like I told you.

07:44.096 --> 07:46.690
Then the party's on me
when it's over.

07:46.766 --> 07:49.599
Gabe, when it's over...

07:49.669 --> 07:53.161
we'll all be lucky to get away
before they kill us.

07:53.239 --> 07:55.969
What's the difference between
a hustler and a good con man?

07:56.042 --> 08:00.706
- What?
- A hustler has to leave town quickly...

08:00.780 --> 08:05.808
but a good con man doesn't have
to leave until he wants to.

08:25.838 --> 08:28.170
We're in business.

08:29.242 --> 08:31.107
- Fitz, man.
- Corny.

08:31.177 --> 08:32.974
- Right.
- How are you?

08:33.044 --> 08:35.342
Remember I promised to introduce you
to some of the guys?

08:35.414 --> 08:36.847
You certainly did.

08:36.916 --> 08:39.714
- This is Frank and Sam.
- Hello.

08:39.784 --> 08:42.515
That's Tank there. Over there
playing pool is Robby and Billy.

08:42.587 --> 08:45.523
- This is the big fertilizer man.
- Randall Patrick O'Shannon Fitzpatrick.

08:45.591 --> 08:48.526
- Call me "Fitz. "
- I hear you're good with card tricks.

08:48.594 --> 08:50.653
- You did?
- How are you at the real thing?

08:52.598 --> 08:55.032
You don't want me
sitting in here.

08:55.101 --> 08:57.035
Cards just turn to money
in these hands.

08:57.103 --> 08:58.968
Back home they call me
"The Cleveland Collector. "

08:59.038 --> 09:00.471
He told me that.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.202
They'll call you the "Cleveland Clown"
after we're through with you.

09:03.276 --> 09:05.267
They will?

09:05.344 --> 09:07.278
Sit your ass down.

09:09.015 --> 09:11.006
Seriously?

09:11.083 --> 09:14.610
I don't want any hard feelings here.
I'll take all your money.

09:18.724 --> 09:22.421
I hope I got enough money
to get in this game.

09:22.495 --> 09:24.087
Cut 'em.

09:27.066 --> 09:30.194
Luck be a lady tonight.
Thank you.

09:32.338 --> 09:36.502
I'm sorry. Really.

09:37.977 --> 09:39.342
Must be my lucky day.

09:41.280 --> 09:44.738
Sam, thank you.
Thank you kindly.

09:44.817 --> 09:46.614
Ouch.

09:55.227 --> 09:57.923
This is fun.
Isn't this fun?

09:57.997 --> 10:00.363
- Shit.
- Damn.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.867
- Is this his?
- It must be.

10:03.936 --> 10:05.699
This is a nice truck.

10:05.771 --> 10:07.705
I'd give my dick
for a truck like this.

10:07.773 --> 10:09.365
What would be the use
of having it?

10:09.442 --> 10:10.875
Yeah, right.

10:13.045 --> 10:15.605
I better be going.
I'll see you around.

10:15.681 --> 10:17.706
All right, Robby.
Talk to you later.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.216
Yeah.

10:24.056 --> 10:26.684
God, I love this building.

10:26.759 --> 10:29.023
Yeah, you were a genius
to buy this place.

10:29.095 --> 10:32.394
No, I was a genius
to have the town buy this place...

10:32.465 --> 10:34.456
and then hire me to manage it.

10:34.533 --> 10:35.966
That's genius.

10:37.169 --> 10:40.161
You know, Daddy,
you are this town.

10:40.239 --> 10:42.070
Yes, I am.

10:43.275 --> 10:44.799
You left yourself wide-open.

10:44.877 --> 10:48.813
I'll tell you something, there are
several ways of getting things done.

10:48.881 --> 10:51.406
It's time you start learning
what they are.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.918
Someday Diggstown will be yours.

10:55.254 --> 10:57.347
I'm ready whenever you say, sir.

10:57.423 --> 11:00.620
I'm sure you are, Robby Gillon.

11:00.693 --> 11:04.060
Every day it becomes more and more
important to how people see you.

11:04.130 --> 11:06.064
You want to make goddamn sure...

11:06.132 --> 11:09.693
they don't ever see anything
you don't want them to see.

11:09.769 --> 11:11.202
You got that?

11:12.505 --> 11:14.439
Yeah, I guess so.

11:14.507 --> 11:15.940
Good boy.

11:17.076 --> 11:18.976
There's my boy.

11:19.045 --> 11:23.539
Then I think maybe they should get used
to seeing how good you look.

11:26.952 --> 11:31.412
In a 1958 red and white Corvette.

11:34.527 --> 11:35.960
Oh, my God, Daddy.

11:39.265 --> 11:41.631
- You're next, Robby.
- I can't believe this.

11:41.701 --> 11:44.295
- That's what that car says.
- She's beautiful, Daddy.

11:51.143 --> 11:54.408
I know you're in a hurry,
but it would mean a lot to me...

11:54.480 --> 11:57.643
if you could stop
and say hi to my dogs.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.742
"Say hi to your dogs"?
Are you joking?

11:59.819 --> 12:02.788
- What is that?
- They'd smell me on this.

12:02.855 --> 12:06.484
Wolf, you'll be out of here
in two weeks. Please.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.789
But I've been gone a long time.
I know they miss me.

12:08.861 --> 12:10.522
It won't be no trouble.

12:10.596 --> 12:12.427
They're at the boardinghouse
with my sister.

12:12.498 --> 12:15.331
That's right. I don't want anyone
to know that you and I know each other.

12:15.401 --> 12:17.028
Come on, think about this.

12:17.103 --> 12:19.970
How will talking to my dogs
tell her that?

12:20.039 --> 12:23.202
We'll need Emily's help
on this thing we're setting up.

12:23.275 --> 12:25.539
I can't ask her to do that.
I don't know her. She's your sister.

12:25.611 --> 12:28.603
You have to ask her when you get out.
Use your head.

12:28.681 --> 12:32.777
She hates me! I wouldn't see her
when she come up here.

12:32.852 --> 12:34.547
She won't return my letters.

12:35.788 --> 12:37.813
I'll say hi to your fucking dogs
for you, okay?

12:37.890 --> 12:39.983
Oh, thanks.

12:43.996 --> 12:47.727
State of Georgia might be through
with you, Caine, but I'm not.

12:47.800 --> 12:51.201
You know what you need?
You need to get out more often.

12:51.270 --> 12:54.034
You're spending way too much time
in the company of men.

12:54.106 --> 12:55.698
Be seeing you, Caine.

12:57.009 --> 12:59.773
In your fucking dreams.
Come on, open up.

12:59.845 --> 13:01.335
I got a whole world waiting.

13:01.413 --> 13:02.846
Hey, baby.

13:13.225 --> 13:17.525
Shit, not even a damn kiss
on the cheek.

13:17.596 --> 13:19.029
What a stud.

13:34.914 --> 13:37.576
Gabriel, has it been
two years already?

13:39.285 --> 13:41.583
The action hasn't been
the same without you.

13:41.654 --> 13:44.953
They credit you two-for-one these days,
if you don't use a gun.

13:45.024 --> 13:47.049
God bless the liberals.

13:47.126 --> 13:49.185
Paulo.

13:49.261 --> 13:52.958
I'm setting something up, Victor.
The money will run half a million...

13:53.032 --> 13:55.865
and I'll need an establishment type,
like the esteemed Victor Corsini...

13:55.935 --> 13:57.459
to hold the money.

13:57.536 --> 14:00.528
- You interested?
- How about this guy?

14:02.208 --> 14:04.335
You know I can't resist
watching you work...

14:04.410 --> 14:07.436
but where did you
ever get $500,000?

14:08.647 --> 14:10.080
From you.

14:14.787 --> 14:17.722
Don't make me
have to kill you.

14:17.790 --> 14:20.691
You know how I hate it
when I have to kill my friends.

14:20.759 --> 14:25.219
Far be it for me to ruin your day.
Do I have it or not?

15:04.270 --> 15:06.932
Come on, boy!
Give him a left hook!

15:08.941 --> 15:12.069
For crying out loud!
What kind of a fight do you call that?

15:16.382 --> 15:18.316
You in the wrong seat, boy.

15:21.720 --> 15:23.654
Nobody gave seating assignments.

15:23.722 --> 15:26.156
I'm about ready
to give you one.

15:26.225 --> 15:28.819
This is Mr. Gillors chair.

15:28.894 --> 15:32.227
You must be our Floridian tourist.

15:32.298 --> 15:34.994
You certainly have wonderful taste
in automobiles.

15:35.067 --> 15:38.525
Yeah, though it's
kind of a limp color.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.538
Snowflake white.

15:40.606 --> 15:43.200
But I figured
better a limp color...

15:43.275 --> 15:47.143
than a limp model
like the 300.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.180
At least
I had enough change left over...

15:50.249 --> 15:52.649
to buy myself a proper
pair of socks.

15:54.920 --> 15:56.945
I'm just fucking with you.
You want your seat back?

15:57.022 --> 15:59.923
Please, feel free.
I was bored shitless anyway.

16:00.859 --> 16:03.327
Our boxing here in Diggstown...

16:03.395 --> 16:05.693
is not to your satisfaction, Mr...

16:08.334 --> 16:09.926
- John Gillon.
- Nice to meet you.

16:10.002 --> 16:12.869
- Can I be frank with you?
- Please.

16:12.938 --> 16:16.305
It's never too satisfying knowing who
will win. You know what I mean?

16:16.375 --> 16:17.933
Take this mamaluke
in the white trunks.

16:18.010 --> 16:21.946
Halfway through the first round,
I know he'll be kissing canvas.

16:22.014 --> 16:24.107
He's already done it twice.

16:24.183 --> 16:28.051
So what do you think? Will he
kiss canvas the third time? Yes.

16:28.120 --> 16:30.520
All right!

16:30.589 --> 16:33.353
Guys, I'm as surprised as you are.
Believe me, that was a lucky shot.

16:35.060 --> 16:36.823
Should we up the bet again?

16:36.895 --> 16:39.159
We better take him
while he's still able to stand.

16:39.231 --> 16:44.168
Always go with what you know, Frank.
My cardinal rule of gambling.

16:44.236 --> 16:45.703
You ready for 300 a game?

16:45.771 --> 16:49.332
Three thousand. I'll play the kid
for pink slips if he wants.

16:49.408 --> 16:52.571
You really serious?
That truck?

16:52.644 --> 16:55.135
Hell, yeah.
I always wanted a Corvette.

16:55.214 --> 16:57.205
Besides, a man never bets
what he can't back up.

16:57.282 --> 17:00.046
- Right?
- That's right.

17:00.119 --> 17:01.552
Let's do it.

17:04.790 --> 17:07.190
So you're saying
you think this man...

17:07.259 --> 17:09.954
over here in the red trunks
will win this fight?

17:12.064 --> 17:13.861
Is there an acoustical problem
in here?

17:13.932 --> 17:16.730
I don't think
he'll win this fight.

17:16.801 --> 17:19.566
I know he'll win this fight.

17:19.637 --> 17:21.070
I have to split.

17:21.140 --> 17:23.938
By the way,
I'd bet a thousand on it.

17:24.009 --> 17:26.739
But would you bet 2,000 bucks on it?

17:33.819 --> 17:35.252
Are you joking?

17:35.320 --> 17:39.654
There's two things we never joke about
in Diggstown, Mr. Caine:

17:39.725 --> 17:42.057
Our boxing and our betting.

17:42.127 --> 17:44.027
It's one minute.

17:46.131 --> 17:47.894
Go get 'em!

17:49.501 --> 17:50.661
A minute ten.

17:53.472 --> 17:54.632
Fifteen.

17:54.706 --> 17:56.867
17, 18, 19!

17:59.978 --> 18:01.946
One minute, 19 seconds.

18:02.014 --> 18:03.447
Huh?

18:07.519 --> 18:10.454
That's very good.
He's good. You're good.

18:10.522 --> 18:12.456
Why don't you save the effort
and concede?

18:12.524 --> 18:15.618
No, I've done that good before.

18:15.694 --> 18:18.162
Question is: Can I do it now?

18:21.967 --> 18:23.400
Great.

18:27.072 --> 18:28.505
Buck!

18:50.095 --> 18:53.462
Nobody sits in my seat.

18:53.532 --> 18:55.022
A minute, ten.

18:56.268 --> 18:57.667
Twelve.

19:01.006 --> 19:04.100
15, 16, 17.

19:06.445 --> 19:10.211
Yes! I can't believe it!

19:15.754 --> 19:17.187
Keys.

19:18.690 --> 19:20.419
Come on.

19:26.398 --> 19:27.865
Thank you.

19:27.933 --> 19:29.400
Drinks on me!

19:35.574 --> 19:37.007
Hustling?

19:38.710 --> 19:40.644
Now ain't that a bitch?

19:42.214 --> 19:44.182
Did I ask you to shoot pool?

19:47.419 --> 19:50.354
Or beg to play poker
with you guys? Hell, no!

19:50.422 --> 19:52.856
I told you I was gonna win!

19:52.925 --> 19:55.359
Now you're upset
because you didn't listen?

19:55.427 --> 20:00.194
I'm sorry. You're just a little bit
full of shit on this one.

20:03.769 --> 20:06.533
Like this sorry nonsense right here.

20:06.605 --> 20:10.006
You saying something
about Charles Macum Diggs, hotshot?

20:11.610 --> 20:13.544
Come on, Frank.

20:13.612 --> 20:16.547
Charles Macum Diggs
is one of the most overrated...

20:16.615 --> 20:19.607
would-be-but-never-was
heavyweights of modern times.

20:19.685 --> 20:21.812
It's a wonder he didn't get killed
in that last fight...

20:25.624 --> 20:30.220
Charles Macum Diggs was one
of the greatest boxers of all time.

20:30.295 --> 20:32.889
I've seen him put away
as many as five men in one day...

20:32.965 --> 20:34.830
when he was training.

20:34.900 --> 20:38.233
You name anybody
you've ever seen do that, loudmouth.

20:39.638 --> 20:41.128
"Honey" Roy Palmer.

20:42.207 --> 20:43.674
Who?

20:43.742 --> 20:47.075
The most underrated...

20:48.146 --> 20:50.410
heavyweight of modern time.

20:56.321 --> 20:58.789
I never heard of him.

20:58.857 --> 21:02.020
You never heard of him
because he never got a shot.

21:02.094 --> 21:04.688
He could take on
any ten of you in a day.

21:04.763 --> 21:09.200
- Any ten, any day!
- Nobody can take ten men.

21:10.369 --> 21:13.202
I got $10,000
against your thousand...

21:13.272 --> 21:15.240
says he can take on
any ten Diggstown men...

21:15.307 --> 21:17.036
and walk away from every one.

21:17.109 --> 21:20.442
- Let's take him, Frank.
- Don't tell me what I know.

21:21.513 --> 21:24.880
Wanda,
I'm in fierce need of libation.

21:24.950 --> 21:28.147
How's about your $100,000...

21:28.220 --> 21:30.051
against my 10,000?

21:30.122 --> 21:31.851
Hell, yeah. Why not?

21:31.923 --> 21:34.357
You got yourself a bet, sonny.

21:39.965 --> 21:45.164
- Who are you?
- John Clayton Gillon is who I am.

21:45.237 --> 21:48.400
Former manager
and forever champion...

21:48.473 --> 21:51.237
of Charles Macum Diggs.

21:51.310 --> 21:55.872
When were you thinking of putting on
this little event, Mr...

21:55.947 --> 21:59.383
You? You're not serious.

21:59.451 --> 22:02.181
Yeah, I am serious.

22:02.254 --> 22:06.691
I brought my $10,000 cash
just to show you how serious.

22:07.759 --> 22:09.920
Surely, you have your 100,000?

22:11.963 --> 22:14.523
You own my sors car, I understand.

22:14.599 --> 22:16.863
That's got to be won'th 25.

22:16.935 --> 22:19.529
I've seen that fancy rig
of yours outside.

22:19.604 --> 22:22.004
At least they said it was yours.
That's another 25.

22:22.074 --> 22:24.668
That's 50.
That leaves 50 cash.

22:24.743 --> 22:26.370
A high roller like yourself...

22:26.445 --> 22:31.212
I'm sure you have $50,000 cash
on you at all times.

22:31.283 --> 22:33.046
Because if you don't...

22:33.118 --> 22:36.747
You know what we call that
around here?

22:36.822 --> 22:39.120
A forfeit.

22:39.191 --> 22:41.591
And right now.

22:43.795 --> 22:48.425
- I didn't necessarily mean $10,000.
- I'll back him.

22:54.806 --> 22:56.899
Are you a fan
of "Honey" Roy Palmer's too?

22:56.975 --> 23:01.844
I don't even know who he is.
I just want to see you eat ten grand.

23:01.913 --> 23:03.710
Your man as good as you say, stud?

23:04.816 --> 23:06.340
Fucking well better be.

23:06.418 --> 23:08.352
I don't want any more money
kept with this sheriff either.

23:08.420 --> 23:11.218
You know Dubber Wiseman in Vegas,
Victor Corsini in Miami?

23:11.289 --> 23:13.018
I know Mr. Corsini.

23:13.091 --> 23:15.025
Has an excellent reputation.

23:15.093 --> 23:17.891
Have no problem
with him escrowing our wager.

23:17.963 --> 23:22.866
Monday morning you make sure the funds
are wired to Mr. Corsini in Miami.

23:22.934 --> 23:25.459
How's two weeks from tonight
for the event?

23:26.972 --> 23:28.405
Done.

23:28.473 --> 23:30.771
I'll be back Wednesday
to work out the fight rules.

23:30.842 --> 23:33.367
Fair enough.

23:33.445 --> 23:37.108
Chubby, the vehicles
will remain here in town.

23:37.182 --> 23:40.879
Somebody remind me
in church Sunday morning...

23:40.952 --> 23:43.716
to thank God for making fools.

23:54.966 --> 23:58.902
Morning, Fitz!
Come on.

24:00.305 --> 24:03.001
Yes. Nice look.

24:03.074 --> 24:05.508
Seven pitchers of beer.

24:05.577 --> 24:07.841
I told you the pills would keep you
from getting drunk.

24:07.913 --> 24:12.282
The hangover, on the other hand,
is pretty much nonnegotiable.

24:12.350 --> 24:13.783
Nice face.

24:15.720 --> 24:17.347
Can I get you something?

24:18.590 --> 24:22.458
Anchovies and milk?
Some deviled eggs?

24:22.527 --> 24:26.793
You've got to take me to the airport.
I gotta go to Texas and get Roy now.

24:26.865 --> 24:30.858
Why do you have to get Roy? There's
no problem with him coming on his own.

24:30.936 --> 24:34.235
There is if he doesn't know
he's supposed to. Sugar?

24:35.941 --> 24:37.374
What?

24:40.045 --> 24:44.038
- Yes?
- Roy's in, right?

24:44.115 --> 24:46.549
Did Roy say he isn't in?

24:46.618 --> 24:49.052
No, he's in.
I mean, pretty much.

24:49.120 --> 24:51.782
He hasn't said that he's out.

24:55.427 --> 24:57.224
Yes?

24:57.295 --> 25:00.594
What did he say
when you asked him if he's in?

25:04.236 --> 25:06.397
I haven't asked him yet.

25:08.807 --> 25:12.004
No good?
How about some pork tartar?

25:13.411 --> 25:15.345
Some goulash maybe?

25:15.413 --> 25:17.677
How about a little Spam and yogurt?

25:17.749 --> 25:20.217
How about some moo goo gai pan?

25:20.285 --> 25:22.014
Keep your eyes on the man.

25:22.087 --> 25:25.352
Keep that right hand where you can
feel it 'cause you can't see it.

25:25.423 --> 25:28.392
Let's try the double jab.
One, two! All right.

25:28.460 --> 25:32.021
Remember: Keep your elbows in
and turn that punch over.

25:32.097 --> 25:36.193
I got a trick here for you.
This one's a double jab and...

25:39.871 --> 25:43.034
- You got my money?
- Not exactly, but...

25:43.108 --> 25:44.973
Then get out of here.

25:45.043 --> 25:49.412
- Stop trying to be mad at me.
- I'm not trying. I am mad at you.

25:49.481 --> 25:53.941
You're sulking because
of that last night in Moline.

25:54.019 --> 25:58.479
Hold it.
Jose, you take over.

25:58.557 --> 26:01.151
You looked hurt, Roy,
so I stopped the fight.

26:03.194 --> 26:05.389
You lost faith in me.
It was a cash fight.

26:05.463 --> 26:09.729
You kept drilling me that half
of the money is in the acting.

26:09.801 --> 26:11.496
$92,000, man.

26:14.406 --> 26:17.239
I know you're here to piss me
on something, but I'm off the con.

26:17.309 --> 26:19.504
I'm out, completely, forever.

26:26.918 --> 26:28.351
All right.

26:29.888 --> 26:31.321
What do you mean?

26:31.389 --> 26:34.517
If you're not interested,
you're not interested.

26:36.428 --> 26:39.693
- Take care of yourself.
- Yeah.

26:42.934 --> 26:45.425
- How's Mary?
- What?

26:49.174 --> 26:51.699
- She's fine.
- Good.

27:04.889 --> 27:08.052
Why don't you come
to the house for dinner tonight.

27:08.126 --> 27:10.356
Dinner. Good. Great.

27:10.428 --> 27:12.658
- 7:00?
- Yeah.

27:12.731 --> 27:16.030
- I'll bring the wine.
- You got it.

27:16.101 --> 27:19.798
- One condition.
- What?

27:19.871 --> 27:21.805
No business.

27:43.595 --> 27:45.927
He's great with the kids
at the YMCA.

27:45.997 --> 27:48.363
- You're really good with them.
- I like it.

27:48.433 --> 27:51.698
Keeps them off the street
and out of those gangs.

27:51.770 --> 27:55.103
Plus, I get to work out
for nothing.

27:55.173 --> 27:58.199
It's important to stay in shape.

27:58.276 --> 28:01.803
There could be a seniors bout
sometime in your future.

28:05.050 --> 28:10.613
Mary Ellen, is it possible you've become
a more fantastic cook since Moline?

28:10.689 --> 28:14.989
You want some more wine?
Let me just fill that up.

28:16.127 --> 28:17.890
Good night.

28:17.962 --> 28:19.896
You two look really happy together.

28:19.964 --> 28:23.923
You've got a wonderful home,
terrific job. You done good, partner.

28:24.002 --> 28:27.062
Yeah, it's a start.

28:27.138 --> 28:29.072
I gotta go.

28:31.242 --> 28:32.834
We were the best.

28:53.198 --> 28:55.962
You get your sorry butt
back in this bed.

28:56.034 --> 28:58.434
He's playing you
like a cat on a string.

28:58.503 --> 29:03.497
- I just have to make a phone call.
- Who you calling at this hour?

29:05.043 --> 29:06.874
People who are up at this hour.

29:22.560 --> 29:25.825
You son of a bitch.

29:25.897 --> 29:28.161
Not only do you put this into play
without talking to me...

29:28.233 --> 29:32.829
but you get yourself in a money deal
with Corsini that will get you killed!

29:32.904 --> 29:34.838
I don't believe you.

29:34.906 --> 29:37.340
And don't think
I don't know why you did it.

29:37.408 --> 29:39.000
I know.

29:39.077 --> 29:41.841
You think Roy will jump on his horse
and save your scheming ass.

29:41.913 --> 29:44.677
You think I won't tell you
to go to hell.

29:44.749 --> 29:47.513
You've got a big surprise
coming your way.

29:51.256 --> 29:53.383
Pick me up at 8:00.

29:55.927 --> 29:58.862
I found "Honey" Roy Palmer
in some old books.

29:58.930 --> 30:02.366
His last recorded fight was in '72.

30:04.435 --> 30:06.528
How old is this boy?

30:06.604 --> 30:09.038
Forty-eight.

30:09.107 --> 30:11.371
With ten men,
he won't last ten seconds.

30:11.442 --> 30:15.037
His knockout record
was uneard of.

30:15.113 --> 30:17.707
Out of 36 fights,
31 by knockouts...

30:17.782 --> 30:21.047
three by technical knockouts
and only one by decision.

30:21.119 --> 30:25.351
Damn.
At least he lost two.

30:25.423 --> 30:28.859
Both to the same fighter:
A guy named Hammerhead Hagan.

30:28.927 --> 30:31.054
One by decision,
the other by technical knockout.

30:31.129 --> 30:32.687
Then he just faded away.

30:32.764 --> 30:35.733
Congratulations
on your new truck, John.

30:37.402 --> 30:39.233
You know what
that book doesn't show?

30:39.304 --> 30:43.001
- What's that?
- All his cash fighting since then.

30:43.074 --> 30:46.271
Those records don't lie.

30:46.344 --> 30:48.608
You fellows better remember,
this is a man...

30:48.680 --> 30:51.274
who knocks people unconscious...

30:51.349 --> 30:54.250
with a single blow.

30:54.319 --> 30:58.415
I consider any such man
extremely dangerous...

30:58.489 --> 31:01.083
even at 48 years old.

31:01.159 --> 31:02.683
Ben.

31:04.262 --> 31:06.196
- How you doing?
- Great.

31:07.932 --> 31:11.868
Ben is not what you would call
one of Gillors most ardent fans.

31:11.936 --> 31:16.373
He is the only one in town,
besides Gillon, who owns his own land.

31:16.441 --> 31:17.874
How'd you manage that?

31:17.942 --> 31:20.877
While everybody else was trying
to get rich off Diggs' last fight...

31:20.945 --> 31:22.708
I went fishing.

31:22.780 --> 31:25.544
It was a real bad time here.

31:25.617 --> 31:29.451
People lost farms
been in the family for years.

31:29.520 --> 31:31.954
Folks really got hurt.

31:34.559 --> 31:35.992
Here it is.

31:38.630 --> 31:42.828
The very ring that Charlie Diggs
himself trained in.

31:42.901 --> 31:46.166
I fixed it up
just the way you wanted.

31:46.237 --> 31:49.263
- What's it doing here?
- Diggs used to work for me.

31:49.340 --> 31:54.403
Asked to put it up so him and his
friends would have a place to practice.

31:54.479 --> 31:58.245
Bought a place over on the river
once he was doing good.

31:58.316 --> 32:00.250
He's still there.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.692
I hear he's kind of a vegetable now.

32:08.760 --> 32:11.695
Oh, he's got his moments.

32:11.763 --> 32:14.231
Mostly sits in his chair
staring out at nothing.

32:43.628 --> 32:45.061
Jesus.

32:46.631 --> 32:49.725
Who's Willie?
Who's Waylon?

32:49.801 --> 32:53.396
I bet you're little Dolly
because you're so pretty.

32:53.471 --> 32:55.234
Yes. Look. See?

32:57.275 --> 32:59.903
Who's Dolly? Who's the pretty one?
You're pretty.

32:59.978 --> 33:02.071
Are you Elvis?
Are you...

33:09.554 --> 33:12.955
You're a friend of my brother's,
aren't you? I'm Emily.

33:14.592 --> 33:17.993
You're... No, actually,
I was just looking at the dogs.

33:18.062 --> 33:21.691
You're a friend of Wolf's
or they'd have torn your arm off by now.

33:21.766 --> 33:26.100
It's his shirt, isn't it?
How is he?

33:26.170 --> 33:31.039
He's good.
He's looking forward to coming home.

33:31.109 --> 33:33.703
Yeah, me too.
I miss him.

33:33.778 --> 33:35.712
Excuse me.

33:37.615 --> 33:39.207
I take it you're Mr. Caine.

33:39.283 --> 33:42.218
Whole towrs talking about you
and your partner after the other night.

33:42.286 --> 33:44.083
"Partner"?

33:44.155 --> 33:46.783
I just met that Mr. Fitz.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.758
I see.
A coincidence?

33:48.826 --> 33:51.556
- Yeah, that's it.
- Imagine that.

33:51.629 --> 33:53.756
You know my brother from prison.

33:53.831 --> 33:56.231
You and this other fellow
show up days apart...

33:56.300 --> 33:58.029
and just before
Wolf's coming home...

33:58.102 --> 34:02.971
and suddenly there's this huge bet
on a fight that sounds impossible.

34:03.041 --> 34:07.137
Coincidence just seems
to follow you around, doesn't it?

34:07.211 --> 34:09.645
You sure
you're Wolf Forrester's sister?

34:09.714 --> 34:12.181
People say I take after my mother.

34:12.250 --> 34:15.185
She was smart enough to get out of
this town while I was still in diapers.

34:17.255 --> 34:22.123
Wolf begged me to visit his dogs
when I got out, so I did. That's that.

34:22.193 --> 34:25.219
But let's not let anybody else
get the wrong idea...

34:25.295 --> 34:29.130
about me knowing Wolf
and being in prison.

34:29.199 --> 34:31.225
It's like our little secret.
What do you say?

34:33.404 --> 34:35.167
I have to go back to work.

34:35.239 --> 34:38.072
I have to ready Miss Parkins' basement
for a new tenant.

34:38.141 --> 34:39.768
I thought you worked
at the bank.

34:39.844 --> 34:42.074
Extra money.
I'm leaving soon.

34:47.819 --> 34:50.514
- Do we have a deal?
- I don't make deals with strangers...

34:50.588 --> 34:52.783
and little secrets
are for little children.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.617
Do I look like a child to you?

34:56.694 --> 34:59.857
No, ma'am,
you most assuredly do not.

34:59.931 --> 35:01.865
Good day, Mr. Caine.

35:01.933 --> 35:05.164
Son of a bitch. Ten ounces
and ten rounds? Forget about it!

35:05.236 --> 35:06.828
Nobody lives in town.

35:06.904 --> 35:11.500
Twenty-four hours, and forget your
fight. They've always been five rounds.

35:11.576 --> 35:14.545
Bullshit to your eight-ounce gloves
and five-round fights!

35:14.612 --> 35:18.673
- Ten ounces and ten rounds or forget it!
- Do I look that stupid...

35:18.749 --> 35:20.683
or have y'all been breeding too close
to the gene pool?

35:20.751 --> 35:22.378
I think you have.

35:23.688 --> 35:28.489
Diggstown is Olivair County.

35:29.760 --> 35:35.392
A day is 24 hours.

35:51.916 --> 35:54.350
Tell you what.

35:54.418 --> 35:56.079
Mr. Caine...

35:56.154 --> 35:59.282
my son and his friend...

35:59.357 --> 36:02.758
are trying desperately
to regain their honor...

36:02.827 --> 36:04.556
and his car.

36:05.630 --> 36:07.564
While I admire
their courage as men...

36:07.632 --> 36:10.396
I worry a great deal
about their safety.

36:10.468 --> 36:12.402
They're boys.

36:12.470 --> 36:17.169
Let them wear the headgear,
just those two...

36:17.241 --> 36:19.436
and you can have your 24-hour day.

36:22.713 --> 36:27.582
But Diggstown is
in Olivair County.

36:27.652 --> 36:31.315
Any man residing
in the county...

36:31.389 --> 36:33.550
is a Diggstown man.

36:46.003 --> 36:47.903
I'll tell you what.

36:47.972 --> 36:52.773
Any man residing inside
the county line today...

36:52.843 --> 36:55.038
and can prove it...

36:55.112 --> 36:56.773
is a Diggstown man.

36:58.349 --> 37:01.011
Why, Mr. Caine...

37:01.085 --> 37:05.044
you certainly don't think I'd stoop
to bringing in a ringer, do you?

37:21.472 --> 37:22.905
Not now I don't.

38:11.989 --> 38:13.957
- Yeah!
- Jesus!

39:01.605 --> 39:03.903
So what's his time like
for the mile, Buster?

39:03.974 --> 39:06.067
Seven minutes, three seconds.

39:06.143 --> 39:10.637
That's good.
Why don't you put down 8:40.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.528
Evening.

39:39.176 --> 39:41.337
- Come on!
- What was that all about?

39:41.412 --> 39:45.246
Sorry. They just like you
'cause they think you're Wolf's friend.

39:55.893 --> 39:58.589
- It's hot.
- You get used to it.

40:03.467 --> 40:06.368
So, what does our new tenant think
about what you did with the basement?

40:06.437 --> 40:08.837
I wouldn't know.
I never met him.

40:10.474 --> 40:11.907
Me neither.

40:22.686 --> 40:25.246
Damn it.
Look at him go.

40:25.322 --> 40:28.257
There's only five days left, John.

40:28.325 --> 40:31.522
Shouldrt you be deciding on those
last three fighters pretty quick?

40:31.595 --> 40:34.223
I already decided on two:

40:34.298 --> 40:36.425
Buck Holland
and Sonny Hawkins.

40:37.601 --> 40:39.535
What about the last one?

40:40.704 --> 40:42.831
What last one?
We may not need a last one.

40:42.907 --> 40:46.343
The way Coach has been
working our boys, he may not...

40:46.410 --> 40:48.469
- Morning.
- Good morning.

40:48.546 --> 40:51.140
Look how he just suddenly appears
out of nowhere.

40:51.215 --> 40:52.648
What's going on over at Culver's?

40:53.784 --> 40:55.718
Here's his running times,
Mr. Gillon.

40:55.786 --> 40:58.118
I shot a whole roll of film too.

40:58.189 --> 41:01.317
Get it over to Verrs
and tell him to put a rush on it.

41:01.392 --> 41:04.190
I'm getting anxious
to take a look at this old boy.

41:04.261 --> 41:05.694
- This is it?
- Uh-huh.

41:05.763 --> 41:08.425
That's as fast as he can go?

41:08.499 --> 41:13.869
Looks like age has finally caught up
with our poor, old "Honey" Roy Palmer.

41:13.938 --> 41:17.772
Take this, Corny, and run on back.
We're gonna kill something now.

41:17.842 --> 41:20.003
Thank you.
See you later.

41:20.077 --> 41:21.772
Just dip your shoulder.

41:21.846 --> 41:23.780
Buster says he dips his shoulder
before he throws it.

41:23.848 --> 41:26.248
Now dip your shoulder.

41:26.317 --> 41:28.012
- Good. One more time. Let me see it.
- That's good, Roy.

41:28.085 --> 41:29.746
Come on, dip.

41:31.355 --> 41:33.482
Yeah, good.

41:33.557 --> 41:35.582
By the way...

41:35.659 --> 41:39.186
I saw Mr. Charles Macum Diggs
the other day.

41:39.263 --> 41:40.696
- Is that so? Good.
- Yeah.

41:40.764 --> 41:44.700
He didn't get that way
from a whole lot of hits in the head.

41:44.768 --> 41:46.497
Tell me what happened.

41:47.605 --> 41:49.038
You know what happened.

41:49.106 --> 41:50.971
- It was in all the papers.
- Yeah?

41:51.041 --> 41:54.499
- What wasrt in the papers?
- What do you mean?

41:54.578 --> 41:56.409
The guy got hurt.
It happens.

41:56.480 --> 41:58.812
It happens to fighters.
I thought you knew that.

41:58.883 --> 42:01.647
- I know when you're conning me.
- Stop it.

42:01.719 --> 42:04.415
- Tell me.
- Stop fucking around and get to work.

42:04.488 --> 42:07.286
What happened?

42:07.358 --> 42:09.519
Come on. Speak up.

42:09.593 --> 42:12.221
Gillon doped him
in the last fight.

42:12.296 --> 42:13.957
He doped him.
The money was long.

42:14.031 --> 42:15.589
I guess he figured
he could make a killing.

42:15.666 --> 42:18.567
Forget about the title shot.
What can I tell you?

42:18.636 --> 42:21.332
He drugged the guy.
End of story. Let's go to work.

42:22.473 --> 42:24.338
- How'd he do it?
- Not important.

42:25.976 --> 42:27.068
Goddamn it!

42:30.180 --> 42:32.978
Keep your mind on business, instead of
ancient history that you can't change.

42:33.050 --> 42:35.780
- You hear me?
- My mind is on business.

42:35.853 --> 42:38.686
Now tell me
how did he do it?

42:38.756 --> 42:42.089
He shot him up with amyl nitrite
between rounds.

42:42.159 --> 42:45.754
Gillon knew that Charles Macum Diggs
would never take a fall...

42:45.829 --> 42:47.763
so he put the dope
in his nasal spray.

42:50.067 --> 42:53.366
How that man went the distance
is anybody's guess.

42:53.437 --> 42:55.132
But there is one thing for sure:

42:55.205 --> 42:58.106
His brain didn't.

42:58.175 --> 43:00.769
There.

43:00.844 --> 43:02.709
- You happy now?
- What's wrong?

43:06.250 --> 43:08.514
Nothing. Just taking a break.

43:10.421 --> 43:14.118
- Did you see Buster?
- Going great. Right on schedule.

43:14.191 --> 43:16.659
Gave me a list of Gillors fighters.

43:16.727 --> 43:19.389
Buster says he can lay a whammy
on four guys...

43:19.463 --> 43:21.522
suggests we approach
the Busby brothers direct.

43:21.599 --> 43:23.032
- Buy them? Thanks.
- Yeah.

43:23.100 --> 43:25.432
Good. That leaves four fights
that aren't fixed...

43:25.502 --> 43:27.970
including two high school kids
with headgear.

43:28.038 --> 43:29.471
Any word on the tenth fight?

43:29.540 --> 43:31.007
- Nothing yet.
- Gillors playing with us.

43:31.075 --> 43:33.805
We probably won't know his ace
in the hole until the night of...

43:38.649 --> 43:42.585
You say you're my brother's friend?
You could be his worst enemy.

43:42.653 --> 43:46.350
You're using things he told you to cheat
people around here for some money.

43:46.423 --> 43:48.983
You think I'm here to steal dimes
and quarters out of cookie jars?

43:49.059 --> 43:51.152
I wish I knew why you were here.

43:51.228 --> 43:53.162
Just promise me
you'll wait till Wolf gets home...

43:53.230 --> 43:55.630
before you pass judgment
or say anything to anybody.

44:19.023 --> 44:21.389
You can, but I wouldn't
suggest you go over there.

44:21.458 --> 44:23.619
- I want to go see.
- Come on, honey.

44:33.203 --> 44:35.262
Move away from there!

44:35.339 --> 44:36.863
I think it's Wolf.

44:36.940 --> 44:38.430
- Is it Wolf?
- Oh, my God!

44:38.509 --> 44:41.273
- It is!
- Get back here.

44:45.716 --> 44:47.581
I saw it.

44:47.651 --> 44:50.711
- Stay back.
- It's Wolf.

45:07.271 --> 45:08.704
- I'm sorry.
- Why is my brother dead?

45:08.772 --> 45:10.399
- I don't know.
- You know something!

45:10.474 --> 45:12.567
- I wish I knew.
- Tell me now!

45:12.643 --> 45:16.477
- I'll tell them you fixed that fight!
- I don't know why Wolf is dead!

45:16.547 --> 45:19.812
It's not because he was escaping.
Nobody runs with a week to go.

45:19.883 --> 45:23.717
- What are you talking about?
- I'm saying that Wolf...

45:23.787 --> 45:26.688
Maybe Wolf was never
supposed to come home.

45:31.095 --> 45:34.428
Your brother accidentally found out
something he wasrt supposed to know:

45:34.498 --> 45:37.194
That Gillon fixed Diggs' last fight.

45:37.267 --> 45:38.962
Before he even realized
what he knew...

45:39.036 --> 45:41.869
he was the county drug lord
being can'ted off to prison.

45:41.939 --> 45:44.066
He never had a chance
to tell you this.

45:57.621 --> 45:59.680
I need your help.

45:59.757 --> 46:03.716
I need you to find out
how much money Gillors really got.

46:11.368 --> 46:13.302
Wolf was going to ask you.

46:14.938 --> 46:16.872
He was a part of this.

46:17.941 --> 46:20.842
They won't even bury him right.

46:20.911 --> 46:23.004
I promise you...

46:23.080 --> 46:26.345
your brother will have the best funeral
this town has ever seen.

46:26.416 --> 46:29.180
Jesus

46:29.253 --> 46:35.158
My Jesus

46:36.794 --> 46:38.694
Your love

46:38.762 --> 46:42.323
Means so much

46:42.399 --> 46:48.167
To me

47:00.350 --> 47:02.341
Your love

47:02.419 --> 47:06.947
Is all that I need

47:07.024 --> 47:09.083
Yeah

47:34.918 --> 47:36.351
Hey, guys.

47:41.558 --> 47:42.991
Five thousand dollars.

47:46.263 --> 47:48.493
Mr. Gillon says
he'll pay $10,000...

47:48.565 --> 47:50.624
to the man who knocks
"Honey" Roy Palmer out.

47:50.701 --> 47:53.067
But, Ham, how do we know
we'll get to fight him...

47:53.136 --> 47:54.763
before somebody else
knocks him out?

47:54.838 --> 47:57.602
Besides, look,
Gillon ain't going to let us go first.

47:57.674 --> 47:59.869
Ham, that's money in the hand.

47:59.943 --> 48:03.208
That's absolutely right, Slim.

48:03.280 --> 48:04.713
What do you say, Ham?

48:05.916 --> 48:07.349
Come on.

48:09.019 --> 48:11.613
- All right.
- Yes!

48:11.688 --> 48:14.350
- Wait a minute.
- What?

48:14.424 --> 48:17.791
Make it look real.
Listen to Roy in the ring.

48:17.861 --> 48:19.522
Don't wave that around.

48:21.131 --> 48:22.564
You hear the man?

48:22.633 --> 48:25.101
Now you hide this good
where nobody can find it.

48:25.168 --> 48:28.069
Don't worry about me.
I hide this plenty good.

48:54.728 --> 48:57.219
Good evening.

48:57.298 --> 49:01.792
I'm Roy Palmer.
I'm the one fighting tonight.

49:01.869 --> 49:03.837
Maybe you didn't hear.

49:05.906 --> 49:08.841
In a way,
it's like you I'm fighting.

49:10.077 --> 49:12.341
But I know it ain't.

49:25.492 --> 49:28.825
I heard what happened,
what they did to you.

49:32.700 --> 49:36.966
Yeah,
things were rough back then.

49:38.873 --> 49:43.640
Sometimes I wonder what would have
happened if I had done things their way.

49:43.711 --> 49:47.238
But you can't fight the money.

49:47.314 --> 49:49.248
That's what I learned.

49:50.718 --> 49:53.687
Hope you never have
to wonder about that, man.

50:29.823 --> 50:31.256
What you doing?

50:31.325 --> 50:33.122
Nothing.

50:33.193 --> 50:36.287
Just trying to get everything ready
for those bank examiners.

50:40.200 --> 50:42.634
What would I do without you?

50:45.706 --> 50:47.230
Don't work too late.

50:47.308 --> 50:49.139
Wouldrt want to miss the fight.

51:09.897 --> 51:12.832
- What?
- You were right.

51:12.900 --> 51:15.994
These are the bank records.
Gillon owns the whole town.

51:16.070 --> 51:18.538
- What is all this?
- He's won'th almost $2 million.

51:18.605 --> 51:20.835
- What is this?
- That last Diggs fight...

51:20.908 --> 51:22.341
He put everyone's money
on the other fighter.

51:22.409 --> 51:25.674
- He sold farms? He foreclosed?
- Land, stores, farms.

51:25.746 --> 51:27.441
- Everything around here.
- How much cash has he got?

51:27.514 --> 51:30.449
He's got $720,000.

51:30.517 --> 51:32.781
So he used their money
and then foreclosed on them?

51:32.853 --> 51:35.287
- Exactly.
- And stole the town.

51:35.356 --> 51:38.792
This Gillon is some piece of work.
You gotta love the guy.

51:40.194 --> 51:45.689
This information can get you killed.
You know that, right?

51:49.203 --> 51:50.761
You're incredible.
This is...

51:55.509 --> 51:56.942
Thank you.

52:00.381 --> 52:02.474
I gotta get cookir.

52:08.055 --> 52:09.920
I'll see you at the fight.

52:32.679 --> 52:37.116
Ladies and gentlemen,
only 22 minutes until midnight.

52:37.184 --> 52:40.779
Quite an exciting way
to lose $50,000.

52:40.854 --> 52:43.618
I'm willing to side another 50,000
that I don't.

52:43.690 --> 52:45.783
Just you and me.

52:45.859 --> 52:47.622
Personal?

52:47.694 --> 52:49.958
Luckily, I brought my banker...

52:50.030 --> 52:53.466
who just happens to have
two drafts here that I can sign.

52:53.534 --> 52:56.469
How fortunate. I'm sure Mr. Corsini's
people have done the same for me.

52:56.537 --> 53:00.803
Thank you. Do you have a pen, Paulo?
No, thanks. Just put one out.

53:02.543 --> 53:07.139
I congratulate you on your choice
of starting times:

53:07.214 --> 53:12.652
Making our farm men fight
when they're used to being fast asleep.

53:12.719 --> 53:14.653
Very clever.
I like that.

53:14.721 --> 53:19.954
12:01 a. m. Is when Saturday starts.
Why waste the day?

53:21.929 --> 53:24.489
Hey, Fish.
How's the Big Apple?

53:24.565 --> 53:27.500
A snore compared to what you got
going down here tonight.

53:27.568 --> 53:29.160
You boys have outdone yourself.

53:29.236 --> 53:32.603
Just keep his eyes open and his cuts
closed, and we'll all go home rich.

53:32.673 --> 53:34.436
- Count on it.
- I am.

53:34.508 --> 53:36.442
Buster got us
the top half of the lineup.

53:36.510 --> 53:39.445
I figure Gillon will see how it goes
before he picks the rest.

53:39.513 --> 53:41.572
This looks great for us.
Buck's the only real fight.

53:41.648 --> 53:45.106
Buster had a bimbo come in last night
and wear out Billy all night long.

53:45.185 --> 53:47.779
So he's out of there. Sam Lester
gets the brown bottle treatment.

53:47.855 --> 53:49.823
He'll leave skid marks
from here to Savannah.

53:49.890 --> 53:51.949
The only thing you've got to do, Roy,
is help make these bums look good.

53:52.025 --> 53:53.617
Otherwise, the side action will stink.

53:53.694 --> 53:55.628
I'll make it look like
the "Thrilla in Manila. "

53:55.696 --> 53:57.755
Be sure to keep your mind
on your business.

53:57.831 --> 53:59.594
- Will you stop?
- I'll never stop.

53:59.666 --> 54:02.635
Slim and Ham are covered.
This cost us five grand.

54:02.703 --> 54:04.193
You want the world to know?

54:04.271 --> 54:07.138
You fighters,
the first two rounds...

54:07.207 --> 54:10.643
you do exactly what I say,
you make $1,000, guaranteed.

54:10.711 --> 54:14.306
After that, I don't care.
Knock the man out. That's up to you.

54:14.381 --> 54:16.975
Buck, we're starting with you
because of this right hand.

54:17.050 --> 54:18.984
I want you to work on his left eye.

54:19.052 --> 54:21.145
I want you to cut it,
knock it out. I don't care how.

54:21.221 --> 54:23.314
Just tear it out of his head.
You got that?

54:23.390 --> 54:26.154
- I'll knock it out for sure.
- That a boy.

54:27.528 --> 54:29.928
You're next.
You're our lefty.

54:29.997 --> 54:32.761
You work on the right eye.
Do you understand that?

54:32.833 --> 54:35.495
This man reads nothing but Braille
from now on because of you.

54:35.569 --> 54:37.969
Fair enough?
Which brings us to you, Billy.

54:38.038 --> 54:42.202
You get inside.
Start working on his solar plexus.

54:42.276 --> 54:44.369
He can't hurt you.
You'll have headgear on.

54:44.444 --> 54:45.877
Yes, sir.

54:45.946 --> 54:48.608
Now it's you.
You get the honors! How about that?

54:48.682 --> 54:52.277
All those years I was on you
about too many roundhouses.

54:52.352 --> 54:53.944
Now they're gonna pay off.

54:54.021 --> 54:56.114
The mars midsection
will be broken.

54:56.190 --> 54:58.715
He'll be as blind
as Tidwell's goat.

54:58.792 --> 55:03.126
Now you use the roundhouses
and you knock him down and out, right?

55:03.197 --> 55:05.631
You can bet on that.

55:05.699 --> 55:08.065
I already have.

55:08.135 --> 55:09.796
Who's next?

55:09.870 --> 55:13.806
See this? This man stood up!
That's because he knows he wants it.

55:13.874 --> 55:15.967
In the pressure cooker,
this man wants it.

55:16.043 --> 55:18.637
If "Honey" Roy Palmer
is still standing...

55:18.712 --> 55:20.475
by some freakish reason...

55:20.547 --> 55:22.481
then you put
these big anvils to work...

55:22.549 --> 55:24.813
and put him down
once and for all.

55:24.885 --> 55:26.648
- You got that, Hambone?
- Yes, sir.

55:26.720 --> 55:29.655
- I whoop him good, sir.
- No, you whoop him bad, sir.

55:29.723 --> 55:31.588
- Yes, sir.
- Excuse me, Daddy.

55:31.658 --> 55:34.923
I'd like to switch places with Billy
and fight in the first half.

55:34.995 --> 55:38.590
- It's all right with me.
- Switching places is out!

55:38.665 --> 55:42.260
I need you in the second lineup.
Don't you understand?

55:42.336 --> 55:45.897
All of you guys better understand
if "Honey" Roy Palmer...

55:45.973 --> 55:50.273
is still standing
after 25 rounds of boxing...

55:50.344 --> 55:51.936
don't you know what that means?

55:52.012 --> 55:55.209
That doesn't mean he has boxing skill.
That means he's got a heart!

55:55.282 --> 55:57.978
The man can fight!

55:58.051 --> 56:02.283
But this is what keeps him going...
and this is where you come in.

56:02.356 --> 56:06.952
You take this right hand
and you break the bones in his face.

56:07.027 --> 56:11.464
Then you go in with that Gillon hand
and crush his brain!

56:11.531 --> 56:13.965
You got that, Robby?
You crush his brain.

56:14.034 --> 56:18.630
Everybody grab hands. Come on.
Let's go. Make a circle.

56:21.041 --> 56:23.134
Dear Lord...

56:23.210 --> 56:26.976
please give us
the strength and courage...

56:27.047 --> 56:30.505
to tear this man
from limb to limb.

56:41.667 --> 56:44.431
Let's go, Buck!
Good luck!

56:52.511 --> 56:54.604
Get your hot popcorn!

57:39.324 --> 57:41.918
You got your instructions downstairs.
Watch your low blows.

57:41.993 --> 57:45.258
In case of a knockdown,
go to the neutral corner. Understand?

57:45.330 --> 57:47.958
- Hit gloves, come out fighting.
- Get him, Buck!

57:56.174 --> 57:57.641
Fight!

57:57.709 --> 57:58.869
Boo!

58:03.715 --> 58:04.647
The eye!

58:08.120 --> 58:09.747
Keep moving!
That a boy.

58:13.125 --> 58:16.617
Don't go toe-to-toe!
Just box him! Get off the ropes!

58:18.930 --> 58:19.897
That's it.

58:20.999 --> 58:22.432
Don't get clever, Roy!

58:24.236 --> 58:25.931
Yes!

58:30.409 --> 58:33.810
Six, seven, eight...

58:40.986 --> 58:42.180
Yes!

58:44.089 --> 58:45.488
- All right!
- Come on!

58:46.925 --> 58:48.916
- Fuck, let's go.
- Not now.

58:48.994 --> 58:50.689
- Get him!
- I got him.

58:50.762 --> 58:52.787
All right.
Thanks. Beautiful.

58:52.864 --> 58:56.027
Looking good, Buck.
Look at me.

58:56.101 --> 58:58.899
- How does it feel?
- He's doable.

58:58.970 --> 59:00.597
That's all I want to hear.

59:02.073 --> 59:04.633
Unless, of course,
he gets lucky.

59:04.709 --> 59:06.472
You can always get lucky, you know.

59:06.545 --> 59:08.206
- That's not what I want to hear.
- I know.

59:08.280 --> 59:10.510
But since I was taking
all the punches...

59:10.582 --> 59:12.948
only fair you share
in some of the anxiety.

59:14.553 --> 59:15.986
Fight!

59:17.422 --> 59:19.856
Come on! Step back!
Get off the ropes!

59:21.092 --> 59:24.687
Get your guard up!
Why are you... Yeah!

59:31.670 --> 59:33.160
Get moving!

59:34.239 --> 59:37.037
- Welcome to Diggstown!
- Yeah!

59:38.109 --> 59:39.542
You're killing him!

59:40.846 --> 59:44.907
20 to 180.
Thank you very much!

59:44.983 --> 59:48.475
- You're hell on wheels!
- I'm taking his ass down myself!

59:52.991 --> 59:55.687
Keep moving, Roy.
Get off the ropes.

59:55.760 --> 59:58.354
Come on! Combinations!

59:59.531 --> 01:00:03.831
Yes! Hard! Take him down!
Put him away!

01:00:08.507 --> 01:00:12.170
- Yes!
- Get up, you fat fuck!

01:00:12.244 --> 01:00:16.044
Five, six, seven...

01:00:16.114 --> 01:00:18.275
eight, nine!

01:00:18.350 --> 01:00:19.874
Out!

01:00:25.757 --> 01:00:29.022
My compliments, Fitz.
He was everything you said he was.

01:00:29.094 --> 01:00:31.961
- He's a real slugger.
- He certainly is.

01:00:32.030 --> 01:00:33.964
I'm so impressed...

01:00:34.032 --> 01:00:36.466
I'm actually willing
to double our side bet.

01:00:36.535 --> 01:00:40.471
- Just you and me.
- Done. That makes it 100,000.

01:00:40.539 --> 01:00:41.972
The man can add.

01:00:48.413 --> 01:00:49.846
Hit him!

01:01:04.396 --> 01:01:06.990
Mix it up, kid.
I ain't made of glass.

01:01:07.065 --> 01:01:10.728
Break it up. Let's go.
Fight!

01:01:15.507 --> 01:01:17.600
Get at him now!

01:01:24.149 --> 01:01:25.844
Let's do it! Come on!

01:01:31.823 --> 01:01:35.452
- He's giving a lousy performance.
- He's embarrassing. Business stinks.

01:01:35.527 --> 01:01:37.791
- Put him away and go for Billy.
- All right.

01:01:38.663 --> 01:01:40.096
Fight!

01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:50.132
To your corner.

01:01:50.208 --> 01:01:53.735
- One, two, three, four...
- Yes!

01:01:53.812 --> 01:01:56.280
- Get up!
- Five, six...

01:01:56.348 --> 01:01:59.283
seven, eight, nine!

01:01:59.351 --> 01:02:00.545
He's out!

01:02:02.988 --> 01:02:04.421
Fight.

01:02:07.058 --> 01:02:08.958
The body, Roy!

01:02:15.567 --> 01:02:17.034
40 to win 80!

01:02:30.081 --> 01:02:32.845
With all that headgear,
it's like trying to fight Darth Vadar.

01:02:32.917 --> 01:02:36.080
You gotta stay with his head.
You got that? Yeah?

01:02:36.154 --> 01:02:39.021
Only an 18-year-old could drink and fuck
all night and still look that good.

01:02:39.090 --> 01:02:41.957
You'd like to put a grand
on the kid going three?

01:02:42.027 --> 01:02:43.619
Cheap Ray Bans, a grand.

01:02:54.239 --> 01:02:57.675
One, two, three...

01:02:57.742 --> 01:03:02.645
four, five, six, seven...

01:03:02.714 --> 01:03:06.844
- You sure you want this?
- He's right, son.

01:03:06.918 --> 01:03:10.217
- You can walk out of here proud.
- Fuck you, nigger.

01:03:20.265 --> 01:03:23.132
Eight, nine!
He's out!

01:03:25.036 --> 01:03:26.503
Nice work, kid.

01:03:26.571 --> 01:03:28.334
Gut shots are the worst.

01:03:28.406 --> 01:03:31.432
- The worst.
- The worst is yet to come.

01:03:31.509 --> 01:03:33.443
Sam's up next.
Remember?

01:03:36.981 --> 01:03:41.441
You can send your next man up,
if you've got any more willing.

01:03:41.519 --> 01:03:45.615
I think I'll be able to still find me
a couple hands not shaking so bad...

01:03:45.690 --> 01:03:48.454
that we couldn't get gloves on them.

01:03:48.526 --> 01:03:51.290
How about your own there?

01:03:51.362 --> 01:03:53.296
You ready to sign
another bank draft?

01:03:53.364 --> 01:03:55.628
- Absolutely.
- Good.

01:03:57.035 --> 01:03:59.469
Your man here, "Honey" Roy...

01:03:59.537 --> 01:04:02.062
Inspirational.

01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:04.768
I'm so inspired that...

01:04:04.843 --> 01:04:09.780
I'm thinking of upping our side bet
to an even quarter million dollars.

01:04:09.848 --> 01:04:11.281
How about you?

01:04:14.052 --> 01:04:15.485
A quarter mil.

01:04:17.222 --> 01:04:19.281
You must have
some pretty big guns coming up...

01:04:19.357 --> 01:04:24.124
but consider me inspired.

01:04:24.195 --> 01:04:26.823
Jeez!
Damn, Sam, you're killing me.

01:04:26.898 --> 01:04:29.833
- Just give me some water.
- What's wrong with you?

01:04:33.304 --> 01:04:35.295
Yeah, drink it up.

01:04:36.341 --> 01:04:38.275
We're very bad.

01:04:38.343 --> 01:04:40.436
At least we're safe.

01:04:40.512 --> 01:04:42.446
I am. Good luck.

01:04:43.548 --> 01:04:44.981
Fight!

01:05:17.882 --> 01:05:20.680
Get a muffler for that thing!

01:05:20.752 --> 01:05:23.812
- Oh, my God.
- That was something.

01:05:26.057 --> 01:05:30.994
$5,000 under the seat
of the cab of your truck.

01:05:31.062 --> 01:05:33.929
Don't lie to me, boy.

01:05:36.835 --> 01:05:38.769
I'm a generous man.

01:05:39.838 --> 01:05:42.773
As I see it,
you've got two choices.

01:05:42.841 --> 01:05:47.210
You can whoops him good
and win your fight tonight...

01:05:47.278 --> 01:05:52.113
or you can lose it
and bury your brother here...

01:05:52.183 --> 01:05:53.878
at first light tomorrow.

01:05:56.688 --> 01:06:00.454
I will get a "yes, sir" on that.

01:06:03.895 --> 01:06:05.487
- Fight!
- Come on, Ham, jab him!

01:06:18.476 --> 01:06:20.137
Son of a...

01:06:21.646 --> 01:06:23.307
Roy, get out of the corner!

01:06:25.884 --> 01:06:27.681
Keep dancing!

01:06:29.287 --> 01:06:31.915
Push him back, Roy!
That's it!

01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:34.925
Goddamn it, get off the ropes!

01:06:34.993 --> 01:06:38.429
Pick it up.
Let's go.

01:06:40.198 --> 01:06:41.927
Stop him, ref, right now!

01:06:44.135 --> 01:06:46.035
Son of a bitch!

01:06:48.506 --> 01:06:50.337
What's going on?

01:06:56.180 --> 01:07:00.048
What's up with these Busbys?
One won't start, the other won't stop.

01:07:00.118 --> 01:07:03.281
Don't take any chances. Either Ham's
decided to fuck us or Gillon outbid us.

01:07:03.354 --> 01:07:05.845
- Tell him to go down right now.
- What if he won't?

01:07:16.868 --> 01:07:19.803
Hey, man, it's time.
Let me have your chin.

01:07:19.871 --> 01:07:22.135
Give me your chin, man.

01:07:28.379 --> 01:07:29.346
Yeah! Go get him!

01:07:31.382 --> 01:07:33.077
Stick and move!

01:07:33.151 --> 01:07:35.642
All right, keep floating!

01:07:38.723 --> 01:07:41.817
Back it up! Put him away!
That's it!

01:07:42.994 --> 01:07:45.690
- Ref, break it up!
- Let's go! Break!

01:07:45.763 --> 01:07:47.424
Corner!

01:07:49.167 --> 01:07:53.103
You, 20 to win 80!
I'll be by the hot dog stand!

01:07:53.171 --> 01:07:56.163
Getting old on me?
You go 15 rounds, you're wheezing.

01:07:58.009 --> 01:08:01.137
I don't know what's worse:
Fighting him or listening to your mouth.

01:08:01.212 --> 01:08:03.612
- That's motivation.
- You call that motivation?

01:08:03.681 --> 01:08:05.774
It gets the anger up.
It's good for you.

01:08:05.850 --> 01:08:08.148
When I want anger,
all I gotta do is remember Moline.

01:08:08.219 --> 01:08:11.450
- Don't start with Moline again.
- Motivation, my ass.

01:08:11.522 --> 01:08:13.114
Just get in the ring
and fight this guy.

01:08:22.265 --> 01:08:25.167
Back off!
Make him do the work!

01:08:25.236 --> 01:08:28.330
- Let's go! Pick it up!
- Go get him, boy!

01:08:28.406 --> 01:08:30.033
Fight!

01:08:30.108 --> 01:08:31.575
Come on.

01:08:38.383 --> 01:08:41.910
He's killing you. He's busting you up.
You gotta finish him off now.

01:08:41.986 --> 01:08:45.319
Show this double-crossing son of a bitch
why they call you "Honey" Roy Palmer.

01:08:45.390 --> 01:08:46.982
Do your sweet thing.

01:08:47.058 --> 01:08:48.957
And you do it now!
You hear me?

01:08:55.233 --> 01:08:59.169
One, two, three...

01:08:59.237 --> 01:09:01.569
- four, five...
- He's out!

01:09:01.639 --> 01:09:06.337
Six, seven, eight, nine!

01:09:18.256 --> 01:09:20.417
- Neutral corner.
- Get up!

01:09:20.491 --> 01:09:24.393
Three, four, five...

01:09:24.462 --> 01:09:29.832
six, seven, eight, nine!

01:09:58.896 --> 01:10:00.557
God, no!

01:10:02.066 --> 01:10:06.594
- Come on, son. Let's move back.
- Get him out of the way.

01:10:06.671 --> 01:10:09.003
- Goddamn you!
- Watch out, boy! Get on back!

01:10:09.073 --> 01:10:12.338
- Get back right now!
- Get off of me!

01:10:12.410 --> 01:10:15.345
- Move back, boy!
- It's all right. It's okay.

01:10:15.413 --> 01:10:18.007
Let me have him.
Come on, man.

01:10:18.082 --> 01:10:21.176
- You gotta be cool.
- They just killed him, Roy!

01:10:30.261 --> 01:10:31.626
I don't believe that.

01:10:31.696 --> 01:10:35.496
Looks like poor Slim had all his hopes
on winning that money.

01:10:36.701 --> 01:10:38.293
- Come on, Ham.
- Be strong.

01:10:38.369 --> 01:10:40.633
Settle down now.
We gotta get you to the station.

01:10:40.705 --> 01:10:44.038
- You'll have to answer some questions.
- Sorry, Ham.

01:10:44.108 --> 01:10:47.168
That was one courageous fight
you just fought out there, sir.

01:10:47.245 --> 01:10:49.179
You know what I mean.

01:10:50.681 --> 01:10:54.811
Ham, did your brother try
to commit suicide before?

01:10:54.886 --> 01:10:57.980
- Suppose you'll want to take a break.
- You think I need a break from you...

01:10:58.055 --> 01:11:02.822
- Keep them coming, you son of a bitch!
- Goddamn it, that's what he wants!

01:11:02.894 --> 01:11:04.657
- Take a nap.
- I want your ass in the ring!

01:11:04.729 --> 01:11:07.630
We'll take your break!

01:11:10.568 --> 01:11:13.332
The names mean
absolutely nothing to me.

01:11:13.404 --> 01:11:16.669
I gotta have faces
to go with the names.

01:11:16.741 --> 01:11:20.541
Then fax me pictures of anybody
ever connected with Gabriel Caine.

01:11:20.611 --> 01:11:25.412
Buster, just get me Gillors
second-half lineup right now!

01:11:31.222 --> 01:11:32.382
Shit!

01:11:43.935 --> 01:11:46.301
How's it hanging?

01:11:46.370 --> 01:11:49.635
Kind of all at once, Paulo.
How's things with you?

01:11:49.707 --> 01:11:51.641
- Better and better since you got out.
- Good.

01:11:51.709 --> 01:11:53.643
Looks like
I'll finally get to kill you.

01:11:53.711 --> 01:11:55.474
There's that
distinct possibility...

01:11:55.546 --> 01:11:58.310
although I'd bet four dollars
against an hour with your mother...

01:11:58.382 --> 01:12:00.612
that it doesn't happen that way.

01:12:06.224 --> 01:12:08.624
I'm really sorry.
That was insulting.

01:12:08.693 --> 01:12:10.126
Five bucks.

01:12:15.733 --> 01:12:18.031
Mr. Corsini felt a reminder
of your obligations...

01:12:18.102 --> 01:12:20.263
would be
in your own best interest...

01:12:20.338 --> 01:12:21.771
seeing what just happened
in town.

01:12:21.839 --> 01:12:23.272
It's kind of working.

01:12:23.341 --> 01:12:28.540
Not that you could have any doubt
who would kill you the worst.

01:12:28.613 --> 01:12:30.137
No, sir.

01:12:30.214 --> 01:12:33.479
Come midnight,
you better win.

01:12:37.555 --> 01:12:41.082
Don't ask.
Just Victor doing me a favor.

01:12:41.158 --> 01:12:44.958
Would you untie me so I can
get this off my neck, please?

01:12:46.197 --> 01:12:48.461
I hate being hung.

01:12:48.532 --> 01:12:50.796
I just hate it!

01:12:54.238 --> 01:12:55.671
The plars changed.

01:12:55.740 --> 01:13:01.303
Gillors got over 700 grand in cash,
and I say we gut the prick.

01:13:01.379 --> 01:13:05.372
If you guys want out,
I'll understand.

01:13:08.886 --> 01:13:10.979
This ain't about money anymore.

01:13:11.055 --> 01:13:13.148
All right.

01:13:36.013 --> 01:13:37.605
Buster get the lineup
for the second half?

01:13:37.682 --> 01:13:39.274
Sonny's up first,
but he's all show.

01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:41.113
Robby Gillors next.
You know what he's about.

01:13:41.185 --> 01:13:43.278
- Grab me some towels.
- Where are they?

01:13:43.354 --> 01:13:46.448
- Back there.
- And then there's Frank and Tank.

01:13:46.524 --> 01:13:47.957
- They covered?
- Yep.

01:13:48.025 --> 01:13:51.119
So we'll wing it with the last man.
Gillon will save him to the end.

01:13:51.195 --> 01:13:54.289
Ray will be fine. I've seen every
cracker on every farm in the county.

01:13:54.365 --> 01:13:57.960
That's five fights to finish up
by midnight, in five hours.

01:13:58.035 --> 01:13:59.468
Can you do that?

01:13:59.537 --> 01:14:03.132
Shit! Is he breathing?

01:14:03.207 --> 01:14:05.300
Get him.
Watch his neck.

01:14:05.376 --> 01:14:07.469
- Somebody get his legs.
- I got them.

01:14:09.947 --> 01:14:12.973
Get him back.
Watch his head.

01:14:13.050 --> 01:14:14.483
He's alive.

01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:18.655
This jaw looks terrible, Fish.

01:14:18.723 --> 01:14:21.157
How's that eye?
Is it hemorrhaging?

01:14:21.225 --> 01:14:23.887
His nose is busted.

01:14:23.961 --> 01:14:25.826
The right eye is hemorrhaging.

01:14:25.896 --> 01:14:29.559
- Got a pulse.
- Who am I? Do you know who I am?

01:14:29.633 --> 01:14:31.567
My hat.

01:14:31.635 --> 01:14:34.468
- I lost my hat. Find my hat.
- Easy, buddy.

01:14:36.474 --> 01:14:39.034
I told you about that. I don't want
to see that thing in here again.

01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:40.543
Okay, let's go.

01:14:40.611 --> 01:14:42.943
You want to bet?
Let's bet!

01:14:43.013 --> 01:14:46.005
I need one-five, Victor.
A million and a half dollars.

01:14:46.083 --> 01:14:47.812
Or I forfeit
and you can kill me now.

01:14:59.029 --> 01:15:01.793
There it is.
All of mine against all of yours.

01:15:01.866 --> 01:15:03.299
Now there's only one question:

01:15:03.367 --> 01:15:06.029
You got any balls
or just that two-inch dick?

01:15:06.103 --> 01:15:10.540
I wish I had a bar of soap
to wash your mouth out with.

01:15:10.608 --> 01:15:12.473
We here to talk
about what's in your bathroom...

01:15:12.543 --> 01:15:14.306
or what's in your fucking vault?

01:15:14.378 --> 01:15:16.278
Are you going or not?

01:15:16.347 --> 01:15:19.805
That's quite a sum of money.

01:15:19.884 --> 01:15:22.318
It's just a tad more
than what I really have.

01:15:22.386 --> 01:15:23.785
I tell you what...

01:15:23.854 --> 01:15:25.913
why don't you throw in
that property you own around town?

01:15:25.990 --> 01:15:28.652
Then we'll just call it even.

01:15:28.726 --> 01:15:32.287
You seem to know quite a bit
about my finances.

01:15:32.363 --> 01:15:34.422
What I know about you...

01:15:34.498 --> 01:15:38.195
would make Charles Macum Diggs
himself get up and walk.

01:15:39.837 --> 01:15:42.237
A million five.

01:15:44.175 --> 01:15:49.636
Take a man with a big set of balls
to want to make a bet like that.

01:15:53.017 --> 01:15:57.681
Go over to my bank, Chet.
Bring my safe deposit box here now.

01:16:02.193 --> 01:16:04.661
I'll accept your wager.

01:16:04.728 --> 01:16:09.427
Of Mr. Corsini's money, of course.

01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:26.144
Somebody has to take him
to the hospital.

01:16:26.217 --> 01:16:28.879
- Will you do it?
- Sure.

01:16:28.953 --> 01:16:32.411
Ladies and gentlemen,
here comes Sonny Hawkins!

01:16:32.490 --> 01:16:35.823
Sonny Hawkins
is now entering the ring!

01:16:35.893 --> 01:16:37.827
The fight is about to begin at last!

01:16:37.895 --> 01:16:41.956
We would like to thank you
for your continued patience...

01:16:42.032 --> 01:16:44.000
during all the delays.

01:16:44.068 --> 01:16:46.093
We have merely three hours left
until midnight.

01:16:46.170 --> 01:16:47.762
With five fights still to go...

01:16:47.838 --> 01:16:50.136
I don't think we will see
any more delays.

01:16:50.207 --> 01:16:52.437
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

01:17:09.860 --> 01:17:11.555
Gentlemen,
to the center of the ring.

01:17:19.136 --> 01:17:20.660
You had your instructions.

01:17:20.738 --> 01:17:24.174
No low blows.
Hit gloves, come out fighting.

01:17:24.241 --> 01:17:27.904
- Sonny, we love you, honey!
- Come on, Sonny! Do it!

01:17:43.694 --> 01:17:45.218
What the hell was that?

01:17:45.296 --> 01:17:47.764
Get the next one up here.

01:17:47.831 --> 01:17:49.731
One, two...

01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:51.165
Come on! Get up!

01:17:58.776 --> 01:18:02.872
Robby, I need you
to do something for me.

01:18:02.947 --> 01:18:06.314
You can't go up there
and fight right now.

01:18:10.187 --> 01:18:13.156
Daddy, I'm not afraid of him at all.

01:18:13.223 --> 01:18:15.953
Listen to me.
It has nothing to do with that.

01:18:16.026 --> 01:18:19.120
Remember what I told you downstairs
about his mind?

01:18:19.196 --> 01:18:21.756
About capturing his mind?

01:18:21.832 --> 01:18:25.290
Right now his mind
is in a whole different place.

01:18:25.369 --> 01:18:29.567
I need you to walk out there,
step up onto the apron...

01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:33.974
look him right in the eye
and then walk out.

01:18:34.044 --> 01:18:36.979
Then we got him.

01:18:42.219 --> 01:18:45.382
Daddy, I'm gonna look like a fool.

01:18:46.490 --> 01:18:48.651
Daddy, I can't do that.

01:18:48.726 --> 01:18:50.489
Do it.

01:18:55.899 --> 01:18:58.094
Don't fuck with me on this!

01:18:58.168 --> 01:19:00.398
Get Robby out here!

01:19:18.856 --> 01:19:22.883
Hit him, Rob! Let's go!
Cut him down!

01:19:57.961 --> 01:20:01.419
- What was that all about?
- Survival, I guess.

01:20:01.498 --> 01:20:04.934
- One less fight.
- Who's next?

01:20:05.002 --> 01:20:08.665
The guy who kicked your ass
at Nel's Bar.

01:20:08.739 --> 01:20:10.934
Rip his tits off.

01:20:14.812 --> 01:20:17.303
Hit that son of a bitch!

01:20:19.516 --> 01:20:21.177
Get up, you bum!

01:20:22.152 --> 01:20:23.414
Neutral corner.

01:20:31.195 --> 01:20:32.526
Disqualified.

01:20:55.385 --> 01:20:57.979
- Who's next?
- Tank.

01:20:58.055 --> 01:21:01.024
283½ pounds of Tank.

01:21:05.062 --> 01:21:06.825
Holy shit.

01:21:06.897 --> 01:21:09.661
Those big arms can't hurt you
if you stay inside.

01:21:09.733 --> 01:21:13.669
- Work him close. Just stay close.
- Right. Close.

01:21:15.706 --> 01:21:17.469
You!

01:21:20.244 --> 01:21:21.677
Fight!

01:21:24.248 --> 01:21:27.342
Close! Come on! Get close!

01:21:33.724 --> 01:21:35.055
Too close!

01:21:36.393 --> 01:21:37.655
Shit!

01:21:42.166 --> 01:21:43.599
Jesus.

01:21:49.373 --> 01:21:52.035
Break it up.
Let's go.

01:21:52.109 --> 01:21:54.236
Thank you.
It's 80.

01:21:55.345 --> 01:21:57.813
- God.
- Close ain't gonna make it.

01:21:57.881 --> 01:22:00.315
Look, he's bigger than you are.
He's tougher, he's faster.

01:22:00.384 --> 01:22:03.148
He's younger than you are.
He hasn't fought 22 rounds today.

01:22:03.220 --> 01:22:06.348
But remember this:
You are black.

01:22:07.391 --> 01:22:10.155
- What's that mean?
- I don't know.

01:22:10.227 --> 01:22:13.162
I'm trying to inspire you.
It's a Roots kind of thing.

01:22:13.230 --> 01:22:17.894
- It's like a motivation thing.
- You are shit at motivation.

01:22:24.074 --> 01:22:25.769
Now you got him!

01:22:27.578 --> 01:22:29.011
That's it, Tank!

01:22:31.448 --> 01:22:34.212
Cut loose!

01:22:35.519 --> 01:22:38.613
Yes! Put him away!

01:22:44.328 --> 01:22:45.761
He's out.

01:22:51.869 --> 01:22:53.803
All right,
throw out your secret weapon.

01:22:53.871 --> 01:22:56.965
And you better have papers
if we've never seen him before.

01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:59.474
That's hardly the case.

01:22:59.543 --> 01:23:03.673
Actually, I believe that this man
is an old acquaintance of Mr. Palmer's.

01:23:14.725 --> 01:23:18.422
- Who is that?
- That's Hammerhead Hagan.

01:23:18.495 --> 01:23:22.431
Your Hammerhead Hagan?
This guy is a ringer.

01:23:22.499 --> 01:23:25.627
There's no way he was living around here
when we made the bet. Forget about it.

01:23:25.702 --> 01:23:29.297
I think you'll remember
that our agreement was signed...

01:23:29.373 --> 01:23:31.933
four days after the wager.

01:23:32.009 --> 01:23:33.806
It clearly stated,
any man residing...

01:23:33.877 --> 01:23:37.313
within Olivair County on that day
was eligible.

01:23:37.381 --> 01:23:40.111
This rent receipt verifies
that Mr. Hagan moved to Diggstown...

01:23:40.183 --> 01:23:42.014
two days before.

01:23:43.687 --> 01:23:46.121
Wait a minute.
This is where I live.

01:23:46.189 --> 01:23:48.123
This is my boardinghouse.

01:23:48.191 --> 01:23:51.786
You snuck this guy
into the basement under my nose?

01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:55.430
Time's wasting.

01:23:55.499 --> 01:23:59.731
Mr. Palmer, he's all yours.

01:24:18.055 --> 01:24:20.489
Thought you'd be dead by now.

01:24:20.557 --> 01:24:24.493
You will be before the night's over.
Man, you look bad.

01:24:25.562 --> 01:24:27.052
How does this feel?

01:24:29.232 --> 01:24:32.429
- Get out of there!
- Yeah! Kill him!

01:24:32.502 --> 01:24:34.163
Get off the ropes!

01:24:37.007 --> 01:24:39.874
One, two, three...

01:24:39.943 --> 01:24:42.275
- four, five, six...
- Get up, boy!

01:24:42.346 --> 01:24:45.281
Keep moving, Roy!
Don't get near him!

01:24:45.349 --> 01:24:49.718
Be alive!
Just move, side by side. Stay away.

01:24:51.621 --> 01:24:54.454
Get out of the corner!

01:24:55.525 --> 01:24:57.755
Come on!
Stick and jab!

01:24:59.396 --> 01:25:03.696
- Get off the ropes!
- Baby, this ain't no dance.

01:25:26.123 --> 01:25:28.591
Come on, boy, get up.
It ain't over yet.

01:25:28.658 --> 01:25:32.822
Two, three, four, five, six...

01:25:36.333 --> 01:25:38.893
Come on. Uppercut.

01:25:39.836 --> 01:25:41.895
- That's the way!
- Yes!

01:25:44.408 --> 01:25:47.275
Break it up.
Let's go.

01:25:54.484 --> 01:25:56.611
Can you hear me?

01:25:56.686 --> 01:25:59.280
I'm stopping it right now!
I'm stopping it here!

01:25:59.356 --> 01:26:01.381
Don't lose faith in me twice.

01:26:01.458 --> 01:26:03.892
Don't make me watch you die.
I'm stopping the fight.

01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:07.623
You really have to work
on that motivation thing.

01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:11.690
Keep dancing, Roy.
Keep moving.

01:26:17.641 --> 01:26:20.735
One, two, three...

01:26:20.811 --> 01:26:24.645
four, five, six, seven...

01:27:43.894 --> 01:27:45.885
You're through!

01:27:45.962 --> 01:27:48.590
Two times! Right now!

01:27:56.506 --> 01:27:58.906
Go for the belly, Roy!
Yes!

01:27:58.975 --> 01:28:00.738
Bring it to him!

01:28:02.746 --> 01:28:05.271
Put him away!

01:28:06.683 --> 01:28:08.116
Yes!

01:28:11.454 --> 01:28:13.718
- That's it!
- Go! Kill him!

01:28:20.030 --> 01:28:23.056
Two, three...

01:28:24.167 --> 01:28:26.431
Fuck, man.

01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:32.273
Yes!

01:28:37.614 --> 01:28:39.605
You did it!

01:28:41.518 --> 01:28:43.179
Excuse me!

01:28:47.490 --> 01:28:49.981
What time did you want
to start the last fight?

01:28:50.060 --> 01:28:52.995
There is no last fight!
There were ten! You lost! Give it up!

01:28:53.063 --> 01:28:55.998
The bet was ten,
but your man only fought nine.

01:28:56.066 --> 01:28:59.035
What are you talking about?
Your kid punked out. He forfeited.

01:28:59.102 --> 01:29:00.694
A forfeit counts,
didn't you know that?

01:29:00.770 --> 01:29:03.000
Of course it counts,
when there's a forfeit.

01:29:03.073 --> 01:29:07.942
But, in this case, there's no forfeit
because Robby never entered the ring.

01:29:09.980 --> 01:29:12.210
What kind
of kindergarten bullshit is this?

01:29:13.583 --> 01:29:16.074
Is that right?

01:29:16.152 --> 01:29:18.143
I'm afraid he's right.

01:29:21.791 --> 01:29:25.022
Our tenth fighter is ready
whenever you are.

01:29:35.372 --> 01:29:39.604
- Minoso Torres?
- Right.

01:29:39.676 --> 01:29:41.803
There's no way.

01:29:41.878 --> 01:29:43.778
The prison is in Winfield.

01:29:43.847 --> 01:29:47.248
That's right,
which happens to be in Olivair County.

01:29:53.056 --> 01:29:57.322
I believe you know
my old friend Warden Bates.

01:29:58.161 --> 01:30:00.925
I said I'd be seeing you again.

01:30:02.532 --> 01:30:07.902
Never try and hustle a hustler.

01:30:27.924 --> 01:30:29.357
I'm sorry, Roy.

01:30:34.531 --> 01:30:37.125
So what's the front page
on the Mexican?

01:30:38.234 --> 01:30:40.168
Dirty as they come.

01:30:40.236 --> 01:30:44.172
Tough as nails. Pain is some kind
of voodoo thing with him.

01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:48.472
He cut Wolf Forrester to pieces
in a ring fight in prison.

01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:08.026
Come on, Torres!
Flatten that boy!

01:31:08.098 --> 01:31:10.498
Yeah!

01:31:29.919 --> 01:31:32.285
That's it!

01:31:32.355 --> 01:31:35.017
Get up!

01:31:40.864 --> 01:31:41.853
He's out!

01:31:46.202 --> 01:31:48.636
I can't believe it!

01:31:49.873 --> 01:31:53.673
- Yes!
- I did it!

01:31:56.012 --> 01:31:58.378
- We did it!
- I told you!

01:32:10.393 --> 01:32:12.327
- Did I tell you?
- How did you pull that off?

01:32:12.395 --> 01:32:16.889
- How did you get Torres in?
- I always take care of my friends!

01:32:16.966 --> 01:32:19.161
You're something else!

01:32:20.970 --> 01:32:24.497
Actually, I believe it goes:
"Never con a con man. "

01:32:24.574 --> 01:32:26.337
Especially one
who's better than you are.

01:32:27.410 --> 01:32:29.503
You beat me fair and square.

01:32:37.854 --> 01:32:41.290
Do you mind? I just lost
this whole piece of shit town.

01:32:44.527 --> 01:32:46.791
There's a picture
won'th about a word.

01:32:46.863 --> 01:32:48.455
Come on!
Out of here!

01:32:48.531 --> 01:32:51.625
Gym's closed.
Let's go. Everybody out.

01:32:51.701 --> 01:32:55.637
Why are you guys so depressed?
You didn't just lose everything.

01:32:55.705 --> 01:32:57.798
We'll get them next time.
You know what I need you to do?

01:32:57.874 --> 01:33:00.138
- Take every armed patrolman...
- You don't need me to do nothing.

01:33:00.210 --> 01:33:03.805
I'm not your fucking flunky no more.
I'm out of it! It's over!

01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:06.474
- Just lose, will you?
- It's never over until it's over!

01:33:06.549 --> 01:33:08.813
You should have done that
a long time ago like I told you.

01:33:08.885 --> 01:33:12.321
- When have you ever told me anything?
- Calm down, John.

01:33:12.388 --> 01:33:16.381
Sorry to interrupt your lovers' spat.
You got a week to get out of your house.

01:33:16.459 --> 01:33:18.484
- Actually, it's my house.
- I can give you a ride to the motel.

01:33:18.561 --> 01:33:21.121
- We can take my new Corvette.
- The law is the law.

01:33:22.732 --> 01:33:24.165
Who are you? Wyatt Twerp?

01:33:24.234 --> 01:33:26.862
- You want to see the law?
- John, what are you doing?

01:33:33.109 --> 01:33:34.599
You deserve to lose!

01:33:41.284 --> 01:33:44.549
Brother, my hands hurt.
You want to do this?

01:34:14.050 --> 01:34:16.143
What you did tonight...

01:34:18.388 --> 01:34:20.322
It couldn't be done.

01:34:25.228 --> 01:34:27.321
Now you motivate me.
