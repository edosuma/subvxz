You did.

[gasps]

01:40.682 --> 01:43.025
Hey, hey. Shh...

01:43.125 --> 01:45.268
You're having
the nightmares again.

01:45.368 --> 01:48.832
You didn't kill me, okay?
You know you didn't.

01:48.932 --> 01:50.934
[groans]

01:52.857 --> 01:55.921
I found out you cheated.
Anything is possible.

01:56.021 --> 01:59.405
That was thirdhand information
from two criminals.

01:59.505 --> 02:03.050
Neither knew me
or who I was or what we had.

02:03.150 --> 02:05.813
-Have.
-You're just a projection.

02:05.913 --> 02:08.336
I can make you say
anything I want.

02:13.082 --> 02:14.664
See?

02:14.764 --> 02:16.346
When you talk, it's me talking,

02:16.446 --> 02:17.548
so I can't trust
anything you say

02:17.648 --> 02:19.650
since I can't trust myself.

02:21.973 --> 02:24.556
You know me, Bell.

02:24.656 --> 02:26.659
Do I? Did I?

02:28.381 --> 02:31.765
I'll tell you exactly
who put this in your head. Her.

02:31.865 --> 02:33.808
Don't say it. Do not say it.

02:46.083 --> 02:48.085
And as much as it pains me
to say it,

02:49.006 --> 02:51.089
you can service my needs.

03:07.549 --> 03:09.552
Shit.

03:12.155 --> 03:14.258

-Bless you.

03:14.358 --> 03:16.060
Sounds like a sneeze, you know?

03:16.160 --> 03:18.223
-Yeah.
-Palanko! [laughs]

03:18.323 --> 03:20.145
Kind of?

03:20.245 --> 03:23.069
Hello? Is this thing on?

03:23.169 --> 03:25.892
I wouldn't point your gun
straight at your face.

03:29.537 --> 03:33.842
So not bad for a case
you were told
wasn't yours to pursue.

03:33.942 --> 03:37.246
Obvious question,
but isn't our actual goal

03:37.346 --> 03:40.851
to reduce the criminal
population of Okaloosa County?

03:40.951 --> 03:44.575
Officer Lorde, I know
Bell Prescott got in your head,

03:44.675 --> 03:46.258
but I'm gonna warn you.

03:46.358 --> 03:49.061
He is leading you down
a dangerous path.

03:49.161 --> 03:52.265
Now, maybe you think
you can fix him.

03:52.365 --> 03:54.388
You wouldn't be
the first woman to try.

03:54.488 --> 03:56.470
Hmm.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.112
[Southern accent] Oh, no.

03:58.212 --> 03:59.955
Bell Prescott
has gotten in my head,

04:00.055 --> 04:02.057
and now my heart's
all aflutter.

04:02.818 --> 04:04.400
[normal voice] No,
that is not happening here.

04:04.500 --> 04:06.082
Good.

04:06.182 --> 04:08.185
Then consider this
friendly advice.

04:09.706 --> 04:12.971
Stay away from Prescott
for your own good.

04:13.071 --> 04:16.175
And don't kid yourself.

04:16.275 --> 04:19.999
One solve
does not make you a detective.

04:21.441 --> 04:23.444
Did you have tuna for lunch?

04:24.124 --> 04:25.907
Was it a sandwich
or a StarKist Snack Pack?

04:26.007 --> 04:28.190
-Snack Pack.
-Ah.

04:28.290 --> 04:29.431
Why don't you do us
both a favor

04:29.531 --> 04:31.714
and get back
to your actual job?

04:31.814 --> 04:33.837
[upbeat music playing]

04:33.937 --> 04:35.599
You got it, boss.

04:35.699 --> 04:37.701

04:38.142 --> 04:40.144
[whispers] Snack Pack.

04:40.705 --> 04:42.707
[man on video call] You should
not be doing that.

04:45.150 --> 04:47.734
You think you can beat me
by getting inside my head,

04:47.834 --> 04:49.256
but you're wrong, Skramstad.

04:49.356 --> 04:53.261
No, I think I can beat you
by just beating you.

04:53.361 --> 04:55.784
Can't know
what anyone else is thinking.

04:55.884 --> 04:57.946
You may think you know them,
but it's a lie.

04:58.046 --> 05:02.472
Their lying hearts will one day
deceive and destroy you.

05:02.572 --> 05:03.794

05:34.532 --> 05:36.474
Bellwether, I have an idea.

05:36.574 --> 05:37.676
I've been thinking.

05:37.776 --> 05:39.638
Maybe a good therapist can--

05:39.738 --> 05:40.800
Charge me a fortune?

05:40.900 --> 05:42.602
Prescribe me drugs
I haven't already tried?

05:42.702 --> 05:44.084
Say things like
"We just had a breakthrough,"

05:44.184 --> 05:45.726
which they will only say
because I give

05:45.826 --> 05:46.807
excellent breakthrough face.

05:46.907 --> 05:48.910
Have you seen
my breakthrough face?

05:49.911 --> 05:52.414
This face got me out of two
different rehab facilities.

05:52.514 --> 05:54.857
Or maybe a therapist
can help you.

05:54.957 --> 05:56.419
You're getting worse again.

05:56.519 --> 05:59.262
-Solving that murder was--
-A good thing.

05:59.362 --> 06:01.425
Generally, solving murder
is a good thing

06:01.525 --> 06:02.747
unless you're the one
doing the murdering,

06:02.847 --> 06:04.149
which I most certainly am not.

06:04.249 --> 06:06.071
Was it? A good thing, I mean?

06:06.171 --> 06:07.553
Sure.

06:07.653 --> 06:09.555
Aside from someone
accusing my dead wife

06:09.655 --> 06:11.778
of extramarital copulation,
it was a blast.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.142
Stop! Stop.

06:15.663 --> 06:17.445
Every time
you go into that barn,

06:17.545 --> 06:21.370
you get morose
and obsessed and depressed,

06:21.470 --> 06:23.472
and I won't have it.

Turn that damn thing off.

Come on, dude,
it's the Village High
Marching Band

06:56.633 --> 06:57.975
at Shrimp Fest 2018.

06:59.837 --> 07:01.840
-[cymbal crashes]
-That was me. Sweet.

07:02.321 --> 07:03.542
My mother put you up to this?

07:03.642 --> 07:06.346
Yeah, she wanted you
out of the barn.
Mission accomplished.

Hey, hey, don't make me
punch you in the face.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.309
I don't want to break
your nose again.

whether I've been
mourning an adulteress

or a love for the ages.

What are you doing?

07:39.487 --> 07:41.349
[Checotah] Don't do it.
Don't do it. Don't do it.

07:41.449 --> 07:42.831
This was the emergency?

07:42.931 --> 07:46.195
Remove this man at once,
or I will hold you
all in contempt.

07:46.295 --> 07:48.678
Hey, Cammie, looking good.
You change your beauty regime?

07:48.778 --> 07:50.841
A little something
I like to call
not showering for a week.

07:50.941 --> 07:54.085
Ah! Any more of this,
and I cannot be held
accountable for what I do.

07:54.185 --> 07:56.568
Is anyone even listening to me?

07:56.668 --> 07:58.710
Hey, as much as I love this,
Checotah.

07:59.752 --> 08:01.374
All right.

08:01.474 --> 08:03.376
Sorry, ma'am.

08:03.476 --> 08:05.479
-See you later, Bell.
-Bye.

08:08.162 --> 08:10.165
[sighs]

08:14.410 --> 08:16.452
That wasn't an intruder.
That was your friend.

08:19.737 --> 08:21.879
I need you.

08:21.979 --> 08:23.121
For what?

08:23.221 --> 08:25.243
To find out how a person lies.

08:25.343 --> 08:27.506
Your whole life is a lie,
but you walk around
seemingly okay with it.

08:28.828 --> 08:31.711
Wow, you're like
a heat-seeking insult missile.

08:36.317 --> 08:38.320
Oh, boy.

08:38.800 --> 08:40.623
Turns out I know everything
about the world

08:40.723 --> 08:42.024
and nothing about my wife.

08:42.124 --> 08:44.127
You're very dramatic.
You know that, right?

08:45.048 --> 08:47.551
I don't see how
I can help you here.

08:47.651 --> 08:48.673
Didn't know her.

08:48.773 --> 08:50.915
She seems like
she was interesting though.

08:51.015 --> 08:52.718
Do you remember algebra class?

08:52.818 --> 08:55.281
You have a very annoying way
of talking. Just get to it.

08:55.381 --> 08:57.844
They always ask you
to show your work.
You know why?

08:57.944 --> 09:01.088
'Cause one wrong move
early in the equation
throws the whole thing off.

09:01.188 --> 09:03.451
You can't get the answer
if you work off
the wrong hypothesis,

09:03.551 --> 09:06.374
and I've been working off
the wrong god damn hypothesis.

09:06.474 --> 09:07.696
So if I have this right,

09:07.796 --> 09:09.779
you want me to help you
solve your wife's murder

09:09.879 --> 09:12.943
so that you can figure out
if she really loved you.

09:13.043 --> 09:15.045
Well, when you say it
like that, it sounds insane.

09:17.608 --> 09:18.830
Here's the problem.

09:18.930 --> 09:21.794
I saw the file, and I think
the cops got it right.

09:21.894 --> 09:24.537
Vida Prescott had a fight
with her husband.

09:25.618 --> 09:28.162
She took off to the bayou,

09:28.262 --> 09:31.806
probably to buy drugs
from the drifters at the Muck.

09:31.906 --> 09:33.608
She had on expensive jewelry.

09:33.708 --> 09:36.171
Someone killed her for it,
and when the cops showed up,

09:36.271 --> 09:40.737
the drifters booked it
to the Everglades
or Epcot or Tony Roma's

09:40.837 --> 09:42.840
or wherever the hell
people book it to
when they're in Florida.

09:43.480 --> 09:45.483
Whoever killed her...

09:46.684 --> 09:49.888
I'm sorry, Bell, but they're
long gone from Boggsville.

09:52.932 --> 09:55.355
I accept that as a possibility.

09:55.455 --> 09:58.759
I just ask you to entertain
an alternative.

09:58.859 --> 10:01.763
That the investigation
was wrapped up
in a hypothetical bow

10:01.863 --> 10:03.525
because no one
wants to look under

10:03.625 --> 10:05.408
the Panhandle's
dirty little rocks.

10:05.508 --> 10:08.532
But look, if you're content
being the town traffic cop,

10:08.632 --> 10:11.976
if the Palanko arrest
is the crowning achievement
in a forgettable career,

10:12.076 --> 10:13.418
then move along.

10:13.518 --> 10:15.660
Nothing to see here.

10:15.760 --> 10:17.763
I can do this without you.

10:19.485 --> 10:21.488
Okay. Fine.

10:30.338 --> 10:32.461
[dramatic music playing]

10:38.709 --> 10:40.711
[sighs]

10:46.479 --> 10:48.481
I have one condition.

10:53.687 --> 10:55.109
I want all of it.

10:55.209 --> 10:58.113
All of the evidence from all
of the cases that you solved

10:58.213 --> 11:00.236
and did nothing about.

11:00.336 --> 11:02.338
Why?

11:02.979 --> 11:04.681
Because for half a minute
there yesterday,

11:04.781 --> 11:06.844
I thought
I could do something real.

11:06.944 --> 11:08.946
Maybe I was right.

11:09.908 --> 11:11.910
I'm sick of being
the town traffic cop.

11:17.197 --> 11:18.138
If you need help with these--

11:18.238 --> 11:19.299
Has it ever occurred to anyone

11:19.399 --> 11:21.402
that I'm a fully
capable person?

11:23.044 --> 11:24.225
Honestly, it hadn't
till you just said that.

11:24.325 --> 11:26.328
[sighs]

11:29.612 --> 11:31.614
I see it now.

11:32.936 --> 11:34.118
What?

11:34.218 --> 11:37.221
The whole not showering thing,

11:38.062 --> 11:40.065
it works for you.

11:41.747 --> 11:43.750
Oh, I almost forgot.

11:46.593 --> 11:48.596
Got it back from Okahoochee.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.139
I am sincerely moved.

11:51.239 --> 11:53.241
Don't be.

I don't know,
but I bet I can find out.

Ooh, I'm telling you,
that boy is gonna see red now.

12:39.138 --> 12:43.243
He thinks that I'm not gonna
hear about his bachelor party
just 'cause it's in Pensacola.

12:43.343 --> 12:44.605
[laughs]

12:44.705 --> 12:46.808
What happens in Pensacola
sure as hell
don't stay in Pensacola.

12:46.908 --> 12:48.810
Especially if what happens
there is herpes.

12:48.910 --> 12:50.532
-Oh.
-What?

12:50.632 --> 12:52.335
Unkind, but true.

12:52.435 --> 12:53.536
Hey, Cammie.

Oh, thank the Lord.

-Hey, girl.
-[both smooch]

12:57.481 --> 12:59.624
You finally gonna
let me attack that problem
on top of your head, huh?

12:59.724 --> 13:01.306
Ooh!

13:01.406 --> 13:02.567
What you see as a problem,
I see as something
that takes no time.

13:02.647 --> 13:03.909
Mm-hmm.

13:04.009 --> 13:06.432
Not that I have anybody
to impress, just by the way.

13:06.532 --> 13:09.436
Oh, well, you don't do
your hair for the men.

13:09.536 --> 13:11.078
You do your hair for yourself.

13:11.178 --> 13:12.840
And who came up
with that shit? You?

13:12.940 --> 13:16.164
[chuckles] I'm doing this
to make Odell go insane.

13:16.264 --> 13:19.088
Uh-huh, which will make
you feel good,

13:19.188 --> 13:20.770
which proves my point.

13:20.870 --> 13:22.893
Okay, see, that there
is what's known as a tautology.

13:22.993 --> 13:24.855
That's like saying the sky
is blue 'cause the sky is blue.

13:24.955 --> 13:26.657
Now, see, I'm over here
trying to spread wellness,

13:26.757 --> 13:29.461
and you "tautologilizing"
all over my shit.

13:29.561 --> 13:30.782
-[laughter]
-Whatever.

13:30.882 --> 13:32.625
You know what
I was trying to say. Shoot.

13:32.725 --> 13:34.106
But since
I ain't fixing your hair,

13:34.206 --> 13:35.508
you finally ready
to change your life?

13:35.608 --> 13:38.872
Uh, girl, please,
my life is perfection already.

13:38.972 --> 13:41.396
Girl, your hair
is pulled back so tight
you can barely see straight.

13:41.496 --> 13:45.000
[all laughing]

13:45.100 --> 13:50.046
Okay, okay, fine.
I came for the brain trust.

13:50.146 --> 13:52.850
Anybody know
where JoJo McDunnough went
after he won the lottery?

13:52.950 --> 13:54.612
Hmm, well,
I know his cousin's ex-cousin.

13:54.712 --> 13:55.934
I can ask her.

13:56.034 --> 13:58.216
How do you become
somebody's ex-cousin?

13:58.316 --> 14:01.541
-You heard of--
-Oh, never mind. Florida.

14:01.641 --> 14:02.702
Or you could just ask me.

14:02.802 --> 14:04.464
-Hmm?
-Okay, with the details.

14:04.564 --> 14:07.107
Okay, this is why
I love my crew.

14:07.207 --> 14:08.069
Where is he?

14:08.169 --> 14:10.151
So word is,
JoJo blew all his winnings

14:10.251 --> 14:12.034
on bingo and "massage parlors."

14:12.134 --> 14:13.716
Moved into an apartment
on Northside.

14:13.816 --> 14:15.818
-[all] Oh.
-Yeah.

14:16.619 --> 14:18.922
-Guess I'm going to Northside.
-I guess so.

14:19.022 --> 14:20.965
-Y'all pray for me.
-I will.

14:21.065 --> 14:22.366
Pack your holy water.

14:22.466 --> 14:24.469
[all laughing]

14:40.288 --> 14:41.750
[knocking]

14:41.850 --> 14:44.213
[JoJo] I told you!
No god damn credit!

14:45.495 --> 14:47.357
JoJo McDunnough--
Boggsville PD!

14:47.457 --> 14:49.560
[intense music playing]

14:49.660 --> 14:51.923
-Hey!
-[both grunting]

14:52.023 --> 14:54.286
Damn.
This is a dumb idea, JoJo.

14:54.386 --> 14:56.388
[panting]

14:59.432 --> 15:00.894
That looks uncomfortable.

15:00.994 --> 15:03.497
Ah, how fare the arrests?

15:03.597 --> 15:05.740
They fare like shit because
I can't read your handwriting.

15:05.840 --> 15:08.303
I yearn for the days
of penmanship, flourishes,

15:08.403 --> 15:10.146
curlicues and arm exercises.

15:10.246 --> 15:13.149
I'll take a course.
Fantastic idea.

15:13.249 --> 15:14.831
Great, well,
before you sign up,

15:14.931 --> 15:16.934
can you tell me what this says?

15:20.338 --> 15:21.640
Ah.

15:21.740 --> 15:23.762
The McDunnough case.

15:23.862 --> 15:25.565
Yeah, that says "Eisenhower."

15:25.665 --> 15:29.730
Corresponding with
the third and sixth numbers
in the sequence, 55 and 57.

15:29.830 --> 15:31.332
Stop by when you're done.

15:31.432 --> 15:32.774
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait, can you repeat that

15:32.874 --> 15:35.377
with slightly less respect
for my math skills?

15:35.477 --> 15:38.060
Really? Seemed obvious to me.

15:38.160 --> 15:41.384
Eisenhower was president
in 1955 and 1957,

15:41.484 --> 15:44.428
indicating those numbers
were likely abbreviations,

15:44.528 --> 15:47.031
as in what one does
when one buys a lottery ticket

15:47.131 --> 15:49.034
using birthdates
as one's totem.

15:49.134 --> 15:50.796
Birthdates, which, as I recall,

15:50.896 --> 15:52.598
belong to
Emilia McDunnough's parents.

15:52.698 --> 15:54.080
Yeah, obviously, I was just--

15:54.180 --> 15:55.682
-I was just double checking.
-[hangs up]

15:55.782 --> 15:57.785
[clears throat]

15:58.545 --> 16:00.288
[sighs]

16:00.388 --> 16:03.291
On May 12th, 2021,

16:03.391 --> 16:07.096
you broke into
Emilia McDunnough's apartment

16:07.196 --> 16:09.980
and pushed her out
the back window.

16:10.080 --> 16:11.982
You got a thing
for back windows, JoJo?

16:12.082 --> 16:14.906
You know, she's my aunt.

16:15.006 --> 16:17.589
If my fingerprints was there,
it was 'cause
I was helping her out.

16:17.689 --> 16:20.793
What if I told you I knew
that she bought the ticket,
not you?

16:20.893 --> 16:23.436
Oh, yeah, sure.

16:23.536 --> 16:24.678
But she bought it for me.

16:24.778 --> 16:26.320
-Oh, she bought it for you?
-Mm-hmm.

16:26.420 --> 16:30.545
Because you wanted to play
6-15-55-9-22-57.

16:32.588 --> 16:33.449
Yeah.

16:33.549 --> 16:35.491
The birthdate
of both of her parents?

16:35.591 --> 16:39.076
Right, right, right.
Right, her parents are...

16:39.797 --> 16:41.419
My grandparents?

16:41.519 --> 16:43.101
Right.

16:43.201 --> 16:46.545
Oh, you got
a lot of friends, JoJo,

16:46.645 --> 16:48.868
a lot of real skinny friends.

16:48.968 --> 16:51.091
-So? I'm popular.
-Oh, yeah?

16:52.252 --> 16:53.474
Bet you are.

16:53.574 --> 16:54.916
What are you doing?

16:55.016 --> 16:57.939
I'm just going
on a little Easter egg hunt.

17:01.063 --> 17:04.047
Except instead of searching
for Easter eggs,

17:04.147 --> 17:06.149
I'm searching for...

17:07.151 --> 17:08.653
a-ha.

17:08.753 --> 17:10.935
Crack.

17:11.035 --> 17:12.738
Hmm.

17:12.838 --> 17:15.461
[upbeat music playing]

17:15.561 --> 17:17.563
-Crack.
-[moans]

17:22.049 --> 17:24.052
Oh. [grunts]

17:24.652 --> 17:26.555
Crackety-crack-crack-crack.

17:26.655 --> 17:28.157
Man, how the hell
do you know where it all is?

17:28.257 --> 17:30.319
Well, because every time
you look somewhere,

17:30.419 --> 17:33.183
I know that that's where
the crack bunny
hid some crack.

17:36.627 --> 17:38.409
Wow, you are so dumb.

17:38.509 --> 17:39.931
[scoffs]

17:40.031 --> 17:42.034
-Hey, hey!
That's a family heirloom!
-Uh-huh.

17:42.795 --> 17:44.797
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho!

17:47.801 --> 17:49.583
Take that.

17:49.683 --> 17:51.185
Hey.

17:51.285 --> 17:52.627
Oops.

17:52.727 --> 17:55.230
[glass cracking]

17:55.330 --> 17:58.174
Ah, that feels good.

18:01.097 --> 18:02.920
-Oh, jeez.
-I know, I know.

18:03.020 --> 18:05.363
I should be writing tickets,
but people shouldn't get away
with murder.

18:05.463 --> 18:06.604
Cam, before you go in there--

18:06.704 --> 18:08.707
Later, Urleen.
I have a Confederate to book.

18:10.749 --> 18:12.211
Hello, Cammie.

18:12.311 --> 18:13.253
Long time.

18:13.353 --> 18:15.355
[dramatic music playing]

18:22.284 --> 18:23.786
What do you want, Marcus?

18:23.886 --> 18:25.868
Just a friendly conversation.

18:25.968 --> 18:27.070
Cut the shit.

18:27.170 --> 18:28.952
You're here
about Arvin Palanko.

18:29.052 --> 18:30.474
You think that you can play
on our relationship

18:30.574 --> 18:32.236
so you can get a quote
for your damn paper.

18:32.336 --> 18:34.359
Well, here's a quote. Go away.

18:34.459 --> 18:36.682
And here's a second quote.
No, we don't validate.

18:36.782 --> 18:40.246
And here's a third quote.
You look like a preppy asshole.

18:40.346 --> 18:41.488
-[laughs]
-And here's a fourth quote.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.450
-You don't get a damn quote.
-Are you gonna let me talk?

18:43.550 --> 18:44.892
Or are you just gonna keep
barking at me?

18:44.992 --> 18:46.854
Well, spit it out.
What do you want?

18:46.954 --> 18:48.957
I want a little time
with Tyler.

18:51.600 --> 18:53.603
[scoffs]

18:55.084 --> 18:57.868
You haven't seen him in a year
and now you just show up?

18:57.968 --> 19:00.912
I know, I know.
I feel bad, Cammie.

19:01.012 --> 19:03.675
I feel really bad, but
there's no hidden agenda here.

19:03.775 --> 19:05.317
I'm just trying to do
the right thing.

19:05.417 --> 19:07.420
I don't...

19:09.222 --> 19:10.844
Look, now's not a good time.

19:10.944 --> 19:13.087
-Cammie.
-Now, I have work to do.

19:13.187 --> 19:14.248
Just give me a second,
all right?

19:14.348 --> 19:15.810
Tickets won't write
themselves, Marcus.

19:15.910 --> 19:17.913
-I gotta keep Boggsville safe.
-Cammie.

19:20.316 --> 19:22.499
[dramatic music playing]

19:22.599 --> 19:24.601
[Vida] You don't
have to do this, Bell.

19:26.243 --> 19:28.326
You think I wanna do this?

19:32.971 --> 19:35.875
Please tell me there
is a simple explanation

19:35.975 --> 19:38.178
for why someone would think
you were having an a--

19:39.379 --> 19:42.884
You know I love you, carino.

19:42.984 --> 19:45.307
I know you use Spanish
when you're trying
to seduce me.

19:47.950 --> 19:50.133
But I do love you.

19:50.233 --> 19:53.938
Yeah, moving here
to the middle of nowhere
wasn't ideal,

19:54.038 --> 19:56.340
and living with your mother--

19:56.440 --> 19:58.864
I mean, I like your mum,
but you're over 30.

19:58.964 --> 20:02.368
-This is about my mother?
-It's a little Norman Bates-y.

20:02.969 --> 20:05.071
There were issues.

20:05.171 --> 20:07.314
You're moody.
You hated my family.

20:07.414 --> 20:08.996
You think you're smarter
than everyone.

20:09.096 --> 20:11.880
You're drunk all the time.
I'm drunk all the time.

20:11.980 --> 20:14.082
I stabbed you in the back
with a letter opener once.

20:14.182 --> 20:15.805
-Just regular, everyday issues.
-[hissing outside]

20:15.905 --> 20:17.687
[sniffs]

20:17.787 --> 20:19.789
What's that smell?

20:20.791 --> 20:22.052
Hey, Bell.

20:22.152 --> 20:25.196
Your mama told me
there was a drunk,
self-pitying pest inside.

20:28.400 --> 20:30.403
Darby, I'm falling apart.

20:32.645 --> 20:34.648
What did she tell you?
Was she cheating?

20:38.132 --> 20:40.375
The truth is, I don't know.

20:44.220 --> 20:46.523
Vida was worried about you.

20:46.623 --> 20:50.908
You changed, before all this
and after your dad, you just...

20:52.270 --> 20:54.272
[sighs]

20:55.033 --> 20:56.415
Vida did come to me.

20:56.515 --> 20:58.217
[soft dramatic music playing]

20:58.317 --> 21:00.320
She wanted help,
but I didn't know how.

21:03.644 --> 21:05.646
I don't know
if she was having an affair.

21:07.649 --> 21:10.032
All I can say
was that she was lost.

21:10.132 --> 21:12.134
She felt alone.

21:13.576 --> 21:17.661
And I think
you digging into this now...

21:21.466 --> 21:23.468
it's not gonna change anything.

21:27.273 --> 21:29.276
[thunder rumbles, rain patters]

21:33.120 --> 21:34.422
Vida!

21:34.522 --> 21:37.186
[intense music playing]

21:37.286 --> 21:39.488
[sobbing] Vida!

21:46.016 --> 21:46.878
Vida.

21:46.978 --> 21:48.980
[twig snaps]

21:55.188 --> 21:57.190
[thunder booms]

21:58.632 --> 21:59.693
Sup, dawg?

21:59.793 --> 22:01.796
[gasps]

22:06.041 --> 22:08.224
In the months
after Vida was killed,

22:08.324 --> 22:10.467
I reconstructed her last day.

22:10.567 --> 22:12.810
Receipts, phone calls,
people she saw.

22:14.171 --> 22:16.574
That was before the...
accusation.

22:17.736 --> 22:20.319
-Maybe I missed something.
-Hmm.

22:20.419 --> 22:22.682
Like a booty call
from her side piece?

22:22.782 --> 22:25.445
Booty call? I swear
I'm gonna slap this bitch.

22:25.545 --> 22:27.368
That attitude is not helpful.

22:27.468 --> 22:29.370
Really? You're trying
to figure out

22:29.470 --> 22:30.732
whether or not
she was cheating,

22:30.832 --> 22:33.055
and I can't even infer
a cheating scenario

22:33.155 --> 22:34.777
without you getting
all up in my ass?

22:34.877 --> 22:37.140
What word would you
like me to use?

22:37.240 --> 22:40.744
Instead of affair,
should I use a fun codeword
like lollipop?

22:40.844 --> 22:42.847
-That is not funny.
-[distant thunk]

22:44.609 --> 22:46.672
[Cammie] Oh, Jesus.

22:46.772 --> 22:47.953
Oh, he'll be fine.

22:48.053 --> 22:50.076
He'll be assassinating
rice rats in no time.

22:50.176 --> 22:52.178
Slingshots, for the most part,
are totally safe.

22:53.660 --> 22:55.663
This is insane. I gotta go.

22:56.263 --> 22:58.366
I heard about JoJo.

22:58.466 --> 23:00.469
You want more of those, right?

23:02.391 --> 23:04.534
Can I mention the lollipop

23:04.634 --> 23:06.697
which we're trying
to figure out,

23:06.797 --> 23:08.799
or are you gonna
act all freaky?

23:09.520 --> 23:11.522
You may mention the, uh...

23:12.524 --> 23:14.526
unmentionable.

23:15.287 --> 23:17.149
I just need you
for a few hours.

23:17.249 --> 23:20.313
We'll retrace her steps
and find out
what she was hiding.

23:20.413 --> 23:22.616
[both] You're really gonna
leave the property again?

23:23.417 --> 23:26.201
I'm filled with...

23:26.301 --> 23:28.303
confidence.

23:33.069 --> 23:34.050
Stop, stop.

23:34.150 --> 23:36.153
-[tires skid]
-[Cammie] What?

23:36.834 --> 23:38.216
I'm having second thoughts.

23:38.316 --> 23:40.258
Yeah, I get that.

23:40.358 --> 23:42.020
[engine revs]

[screaming continues]

23:52.173 --> 23:53.394
[panting]

23:53.494 --> 23:55.497
Would you stop? Stop.

23:58.140 --> 24:00.043
I'm fine.

24:00.143 --> 24:02.145
-Are you sure?
-I'm fine.

24:04.148 --> 24:05.850
It was here.

24:05.950 --> 24:07.492
The day started here.

24:07.592 --> 24:09.775
She came around 11:00 alone.

24:09.875 --> 24:11.697
She ordered torrijas
and cafe con leche.

24:11.797 --> 24:13.059
I know that from the receipt.

24:13.159 --> 24:15.021
Also, she forgot
to leave a tip.

24:15.121 --> 24:17.124
Or she came here
with her boy toy.

24:18.766 --> 24:22.831
Yeah, they paid separately
because that's what you do
when you're sneaking around.

24:22.931 --> 24:24.933
She probably
didn't forget the tip.
He paid it.

24:26.976 --> 24:28.598
Sorry, not sorry.

24:28.698 --> 24:30.701
What's next?

24:31.301 --> 24:33.204
[brakes squeak]

24:33.304 --> 24:34.726
She got gas at Raceway,

24:34.826 --> 24:36.828
filled her tank
at full service prices.

24:37.589 --> 24:38.530
[Cammie] Who does full service?

24:38.630 --> 24:40.253
Vida.

24:40.353 --> 24:41.855
She always said
she didn't wanna

24:41.955 --> 24:43.997
deprive the attendants
of their livelihood.

24:45.118 --> 24:47.341
Or this was the guy.

24:47.441 --> 24:49.444
Pumping her full of...

24:50.806 --> 24:52.508
gas.

24:52.608 --> 24:54.751
-You proud of that one?
-No, not really.

24:54.851 --> 24:58.475
Started off strong,
but then it ended up
turning into a flatulence pun.

24:58.575 --> 24:59.917
-Keep driving.
-Okay.

25:00.017 --> 25:02.841
[Bell] Gas was at 12:12,
then hiking.

25:02.941 --> 25:04.322
She could've gone out
to the trails

25:04.422 --> 25:07.046
near the Air Force base
or the Rocky Bayou trails,

25:07.146 --> 25:09.689
but I think she came out
this way near the River Trail.

25:09.789 --> 25:12.693
Or hiking was a lie
so she could be off the grid,

25:12.793 --> 25:14.255
unreachable.

25:14.355 --> 25:15.737
[sighs]

25:15.837 --> 25:17.659
Welcome to my world.

25:17.759 --> 25:20.042
Finest speed trap on I-10.

25:22.084 --> 25:24.087
I can make the town six grand
on a good weekend.

25:26.249 --> 25:27.872
You stare at him all day?

25:27.972 --> 25:29.193
[Cammie] Who, Spray Tan Sam?

25:29.293 --> 25:30.355
I don't know,

25:30.455 --> 25:32.457
he's kind of attractive.

25:33.819 --> 25:35.761
She could have been anywhere.

25:35.861 --> 25:38.365
She could've been hiking,
she could've been fornicating,

25:38.465 --> 25:40.888
talking about life
with a know-it-all
and his gun-toting mother.

25:40.988 --> 25:42.209
What the hell am I thinking?

25:42.309 --> 25:43.411
Are you gonna spiral out here?

25:43.511 --> 25:44.492
Because if
you're gonna spiral--

25:44.592 --> 25:45.774
I'm currently spiraling.

25:45.874 --> 25:48.217
I have been spiraling
the entire time!

25:48.317 --> 25:51.000
I am currently mid-spiral,
in case you hadn't noticed.

25:52.682 --> 25:54.545
Okay.

25:54.645 --> 25:57.709
Well, let's just say that
there are a couple of hours
that we can't account for.

25:57.809 --> 26:00.832
She got a parking ticket
at 2:46.

26:00.932 --> 26:02.595
-Where?
-I don't know.

26:02.695 --> 26:06.199
Meter number 51163013.

26:06.299 --> 26:08.322
I remember
because it's the coordinates
for Chernobyl,

26:08.422 --> 26:09.964
without the decimal minutes,
of course.

26:10.064 --> 26:11.606
[scoffs]

26:11.706 --> 26:15.250
You remember that,
but you can't remember
which parking meter?

26:15.350 --> 26:17.213
There is only so much
one can accomplish

26:17.313 --> 26:19.836
from the confines
of one's home, even me.

26:21.678 --> 26:23.060
Okay.

26:23.160 --> 26:24.141
Wow.

26:24.241 --> 26:26.484
[quirky music playing]

26:34.054 --> 26:36.056
[Bell groans]

26:37.578 --> 26:41.363
[high-pitched ringing]

26:41.463 --> 26:43.465
[Cammie] Chernobyl, you coming?

26:45.788 --> 26:47.290
-Bell, you okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

26:47.390 --> 26:49.393
All right.

26:49.713 --> 26:51.776
[moans]

26:51.876 --> 26:54.419
-Ugh. Come on--
-I said I'm fine.

26:54.519 --> 26:56.521
God, all right.

26:58.884 --> 27:00.887
Hey, did Vida
have health issues?

27:02.609 --> 27:04.611
[pensive music playing]

27:07.575 --> 27:08.677
Is that gonna hurt?

27:08.777 --> 27:10.078
No more than when it went in.

27:10.178 --> 27:12.401
But from now on,
let's remember not...

27:12.501 --> 27:13.843
Ah! Ho!

27:13.943 --> 27:16.687
...to stand behind fishermen
who are casting their lures.

27:16.787 --> 27:17.928
Oh, that's good.

27:18.028 --> 27:19.931
You really need
to write that down?

27:20.031 --> 27:23.074
[distant pained shouting]

27:25.998 --> 27:28.741
The Wright Institute
for Facial Regeneration.

27:28.841 --> 27:31.545
Facial Regeneration? Seriously?

27:31.645 --> 27:34.348
He's gonna waste his talents
on people's vanity.

27:34.448 --> 27:36.271
I'm going to nip, tuck,
and fill my way

27:36.371 --> 27:38.834
to a six bedroom estate
on Jackson Lake.

27:38.934 --> 27:41.157
Boat dock, mm.
It's gonna be nice.

27:41.257 --> 27:43.440
You know you can have
all that here.

27:43.540 --> 27:45.682
Oh, did I not mention
the prime draw?

27:45.782 --> 27:47.124
It's not in the Panhandle.

27:47.224 --> 27:49.287
Mm, I hear you on that one.

27:49.387 --> 27:50.528
We've come for information.

27:50.628 --> 27:52.331
Vida was here
the day of her murder.

27:52.431 --> 27:53.933
Yeah, well, I wasn't.

27:54.033 --> 27:55.695
I know,
but you took over the practice

27:55.795 --> 27:57.938
from Dr. Vicstein, and with it
came his patient files.

27:58.038 --> 27:59.940
Patient files covered
under HIPAA.

28:00.040 --> 28:02.063
Doctor-patient confidentiality.

28:02.163 --> 28:06.669
Information can be disclosed
to law enforcement officials
for law enforcement purposes.

28:06.769 --> 28:08.471
You write tickets.

28:08.571 --> 28:09.993
Expensive tickets.

28:10.093 --> 28:12.416
And I'm on a first name basis
with Judge William DeBolt.

28:13.497 --> 28:14.799
Billy.

28:14.899 --> 28:18.163
So I can be back in an hour
with a warrant that'll

28:18.263 --> 28:21.086
make your patients rethink
their primary care provider,

28:21.186 --> 28:23.930
or you could do yourself
a favor and cooperate.

28:24.030 --> 28:26.293
Your choice, doctor.

28:26.393 --> 28:28.015
I know that speech.

28:28.115 --> 28:30.338
Law and Order season three.

28:30.438 --> 28:33.562
Logan goes after that doctor
who was an angel of death.

28:35.484 --> 28:37.026
Season three.

28:37.126 --> 28:39.549
-When the show found itself.
-So right.

28:39.649 --> 28:41.231
-[Cammie sighs]
-Logan and Briscoe.

28:41.331 --> 28:43.154
The show was never the same
after Jerry Orbach.

28:43.254 --> 28:45.256
Call me crazy, I like Ed Green.

28:46.738 --> 28:48.120
You know,
has anyone ever told you

28:48.220 --> 28:51.124
you have, like,
a Jesse Martin thing happening?

28:51.224 --> 28:52.445
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

28:52.545 --> 28:54.167
-You think so?
-Oh, I know so.

28:54.267 --> 28:56.010
-Nah.
-[chuckles]

28:56.110 --> 28:57.932
Not cool, man.

28:58.032 --> 29:00.215
Sorry, sorry.

29:00.315 --> 29:03.940
Oh, and by the way,
Jesse Martin was at least
25% hotter than you.

29:04.040 --> 29:05.221
So not cool.

29:05.321 --> 29:07.324
[door creaks]

29:08.445 --> 29:09.827
Find something?

29:09.927 --> 29:11.669
No.

29:11.769 --> 29:14.072
She wasn't even here that day.
No appointment, no bloodwork,

29:14.172 --> 29:17.076
which makes no sense because
we know she parked right here.

29:17.176 --> 29:18.197
Chernobyl.

29:18.297 --> 29:20.300
Maybe she was here
but not here.

29:22.542 --> 29:24.485
That used to be
a lawyer's office.

29:24.585 --> 29:26.087
I remember because
I came here for an ultrasound,

29:26.187 --> 29:27.248
and when I saw Tyler move,

29:27.348 --> 29:29.812
I knew Marcus
couldn't be a part of it,

29:29.912 --> 29:32.855
so I went next door,
checked his rates.

29:32.955 --> 29:34.958
Couldn't afford it, so I left.

29:35.919 --> 29:37.922
My point is, maybe...

29:39.163 --> 29:41.166
maybe she was here
to see a lawyer, Bell.

29:43.368 --> 29:47.794
So you're saying Vida
wasn't just having an affair,

29:47.894 --> 29:49.896
she was also
going to divorce me?

29:51.178 --> 29:53.180
[chuckles]

29:54.502 --> 29:55.523
[moans]

29:55.623 --> 29:57.606
No, no, no, no, no.

29:57.706 --> 29:59.709
Ooh!

30:02.312 --> 30:03.814
He practiced here for years.

30:03.914 --> 30:05.896
You don't have
a forwarding number?

30:05.996 --> 30:07.999
For old clients?

30:08.840 --> 30:11.964
Yeah, I know he moved
to Boggsville,
but he left years ago. Go!

30:13.365 --> 30:14.908
This is a police issue.

30:15.008 --> 30:17.010
I need to discuss
a case with him.

30:17.411 --> 30:19.954
-Boynton Beach, Cocoa Beach...
-[beeping]

30:20.054 --> 30:22.958
-Hello, you there?
-Dania Beach, Daytona Beach...

30:23.058 --> 30:24.760
You kidding me?

30:24.860 --> 30:26.722
It's just a mantra.

30:26.822 --> 30:28.324
[Cammie sighs]

30:28.424 --> 30:30.367
Florida cities with "Beach,"
alphabetically.

30:30.467 --> 30:32.469
No, no, no, not you.
Just, the call dropped.

30:33.350 --> 30:34.772
This Wi-Fi's shit.

30:34.872 --> 30:36.875
[upbeat music playing]

30:38.477 --> 30:40.179
What?

30:40.279 --> 30:42.922
-Get me out of here now.
-Okay. Can you--

30:44.644 --> 30:46.387
All right, come on.

30:46.487 --> 30:48.489
[grunts]

30:50.211 --> 30:52.354
-[sighs]
-[Bell groans]

30:52.454 --> 30:54.456
[bell dinging]

30:57.781 --> 30:59.683
[Cammie] Beekeeping, really?

30:59.783 --> 31:01.285
What the hell?

31:01.385 --> 31:02.406
[Bell] It's the middle
of the night.

31:02.506 --> 31:03.808
Don't tell me
you're ice fishing.

31:03.908 --> 31:05.330
So on top
of all your other shit,

31:05.430 --> 31:07.092
you have a chess compulsion?

31:07.192 --> 31:09.595
Skramstad is the best hacker
north of the 60th parallel.

31:11.117 --> 31:13.700
[groans] You woke up Mother.

31:13.800 --> 31:15.803
His mother?

31:16.203 --> 31:18.907
Oh, my God, he's like
the Scandy version of you.

31:19.007 --> 31:20.909
Mother is the name
of my mastiff.

31:21.009 --> 31:22.231
He needs his sleep.

31:22.331 --> 31:24.954
Why would you name
your male dog Mother?

31:25.054 --> 31:26.997
Irony. Who is this?

31:27.097 --> 31:28.639
Nobody.

31:28.739 --> 31:31.563
I need you to find
the Wi-Fi connections
on my wife's cell phone.

31:31.663 --> 31:33.565
I take it you want to track
her secret life,

31:33.665 --> 31:36.208
see which networks were known
and logged into,

31:36.308 --> 31:38.051
which will give you
some degree of closure?

31:38.151 --> 31:39.573
Is everyone a therapist
these days?

31:39.673 --> 31:41.735
Yes.

31:41.835 --> 31:45.179
Plug the phone
into the USB, turn it on,
and wait for my call.

31:45.279 --> 31:47.282
[line beeps]

31:48.724 --> 31:50.726
Okay.

31:51.167 --> 31:54.391
I hope you're hungry.
I made frog's legs.

31:54.491 --> 31:56.634
I like frogs.
I don't wanna eat them.

31:56.734 --> 31:58.836
-You like cows?
-Yeah.

31:58.936 --> 32:00.358
-How 'bout pigs?
-Sure.

32:00.458 --> 32:02.241
You like hamburgers
with bacon on them?

32:02.341 --> 32:05.084
-It's my favorite.
-Uh-uh. No.

32:05.184 --> 32:07.407
You like them,
and you eat them. That's life.

32:07.507 --> 32:10.411
For one thing to survive,
another thing has to go.

32:10.511 --> 32:12.013
[Cammie] We'll talk
about this later, Ty.

32:12.113 --> 32:15.777
It's my fault.
Indigo never really
understood kids.

32:15.877 --> 32:19.422
He talked to Bell
like he was an adult
from the day he was born.

32:19.522 --> 32:21.524
What was your dad like?

32:24.408 --> 32:26.410
[Bell] Mm...

32:30.375 --> 32:32.378
He's dead.

32:32.939 --> 32:34.941
Tell me about your dad.

32:35.342 --> 32:38.005
He's okay.
I don't see him much.

32:38.105 --> 32:40.088
How about other relatives?

32:40.188 --> 32:41.890
Grandparents, aunts, uncles?

32:41.990 --> 32:43.492
We have lots
of these old photos around.

32:43.592 --> 32:45.014
I bet you have
some good ones too, right--

32:45.114 --> 32:47.116
We don't dwell in the past.

32:48.398 --> 32:49.459
You do that long enough,

32:49.559 --> 32:52.283
you get so stuck
you barely leave the house.

32:56.047 --> 32:58.050
[bell dings]

32:59.211 --> 33:00.953
[Skramstad] OysterHaven.

33:01.053 --> 33:02.515
That's a bar in Fort Walton.

33:02.615 --> 33:04.518
Diddleys-on-the-water.

33:04.618 --> 33:06.040
Bar in Panama City.

33:06.140 --> 33:07.842
I sense a theme here.

33:07.942 --> 33:09.364
We liked to drink.

33:09.464 --> 33:11.246
Shared pastimes
are good for a marriage.

33:11.346 --> 33:12.648
Had your liver checked lately?

33:12.748 --> 33:15.491
Is that it? 14 saved networks?

33:15.591 --> 33:17.334
Fiifteen, one more.

33:17.434 --> 33:19.436
[chuckles] Probably
a bar somewhere.

33:20.397 --> 33:26.745
DRM-8GL-V8GR.

33:26.845 --> 33:28.848
-Not familiar?
-No.

33:30.089 --> 33:31.712
How do we find it?

33:31.812 --> 33:35.396
You don't. You won't find it
without a router ID
or a spectral analyzer,

33:35.496 --> 33:37.278
which even you don't have.

33:37.378 --> 33:39.381
Oh, and by the way,

33:40.582 --> 33:41.924
checkmate.

33:42.024 --> 33:44.007
[line beeps]

33:44.107 --> 33:47.611
Dream-8. Glove-8.

33:47.711 --> 33:51.416
Dorm-8. Galivate?
What's galivate?
That's nothing.

33:51.516 --> 33:53.138
-If it were a word,
I'd know it.
-Bell.

33:53.238 --> 33:54.900
Think.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.102
It's a lead.

33:56.202 --> 33:57.704
Bell.

33:57.804 --> 33:59.826
We toured the town,
I stayed for lunch,

33:59.926 --> 34:01.148
I have to take Tyler to karate.

34:01.248 --> 34:02.390
That can wait. This is big.

34:02.490 --> 34:04.632
No, please stop talking.

34:04.732 --> 34:06.715
You know what's big
for that kid in there?

34:06.815 --> 34:09.518
The one that you used to get
information out of me?

34:09.618 --> 34:12.122
-Karate.
-I need you here.
This is my life.

34:12.222 --> 34:14.044
And you know that class?

34:14.144 --> 34:16.127
The one
that you want Tyler to miss?

34:16.227 --> 34:18.850
That's his life,
which is my life,

34:18.950 --> 34:20.172
which is real.

34:20.272 --> 34:22.014
Okay? Whatever it is
that you're chasing,

34:22.114 --> 34:24.397
we don't know
if it's real at all, do we?

34:25.718 --> 34:27.721
[dramatic music playing]

34:36.091 --> 34:38.094
[Moseley growls]

34:44.261 --> 34:46.004
Am I a bad person?

34:46.104 --> 34:48.046
-No.
-Absolutely.

34:48.146 --> 34:51.410
Seriously, am I selfish,
self-absorbed?

34:51.510 --> 34:53.513
Both.
All those things, you know?

34:54.674 --> 34:56.817
You don't really listen
to anybody.

34:56.917 --> 34:59.821
Don't really care about
anybody but yourself.

34:59.921 --> 35:01.503
And your follow-through
is piss-poor, man.

35:01.603 --> 35:04.266
Okay, I will not have you
insult my man.

35:04.366 --> 35:05.628
You screwed
my whole family over

35:05.728 --> 35:07.310
when you flaked
on the seafront thing.

35:07.410 --> 35:09.513
We were gonna open
a restaurant,

35:09.613 --> 35:11.115
rent kayaks and shit.

35:11.215 --> 35:14.079
I hate to say it,
you're kinda universally hated
by this whole town.

35:14.179 --> 35:16.522
There's gotta be
another explanation.

35:16.622 --> 35:18.624
[Checotah] For everybody
to hate you?

35:19.545 --> 35:21.648
For this supposed lover.

35:21.748 --> 35:22.649
I have to find him.

35:22.749 --> 35:24.732
Maybe he was obsessed
with Vida.

35:24.832 --> 35:27.936
Maybe she refused
to sleep with him,

35:28.036 --> 35:30.539
and that made him insane,
and he killed her.

35:30.639 --> 35:34.564
And maybe that's why
she went to the lawyer,
to get a restraining order.

35:37.327 --> 35:39.330
Maybe I'm making it worse.

35:40.171 --> 35:42.173
What should I do?

35:43.174 --> 35:45.177
I don't know, man.

35:46.178 --> 35:50.323
Find a good doctor,
priest, or lawyer,

35:50.423 --> 35:52.326
you know,
someone with, like, a necktie.

35:52.426 --> 35:54.428
They're all dumber than me.

35:55.149 --> 35:57.572
[quirky music playing]

35:57.672 --> 35:59.675
You could try talking
to the toad.

36:00.957 --> 36:02.378
Toad?

36:02.478 --> 36:04.341
[mysterious music playing]

36:04.441 --> 36:06.303
The toad has the answers?

36:06.403 --> 36:10.749
5-MeO-DMT. Total pantera shit.

36:10.849 --> 36:12.591
Oh, like ayahuasca.

36:12.691 --> 36:15.314
Drink a little tea,
get a little clarity?

36:15.414 --> 36:17.878
Ayahuasca's like
a three-hour bus tour
of Paris museums.

36:17.978 --> 36:21.282
5-MeO-DMT is like strapping
yourself to the nose

36:21.382 --> 36:23.525
of a rocket that flies
into the sun and evaporates.

36:23.625 --> 36:25.207
And that's a good thing?

36:25.307 --> 36:28.391
People say it's like 15 years
of psychotherapy in 15 minutes.

36:29.111 --> 36:31.114
[sighs]

36:33.237 --> 36:34.338
What happens next?

36:34.438 --> 36:36.441
I don't know, man.

36:36.801 --> 36:38.803
Ask the toad.

36:50.938 --> 36:51.960
Anything?

36:52.060 --> 36:54.663
[slow moaning]

37:06.438 --> 37:08.440
Lightweight.

37:10.683 --> 37:12.685
[mysterious music playing]

37:16.530 --> 37:18.533
Checotah?

37:20.856 --> 37:22.858
[toad croaking]

37:44.685 --> 37:46.688
[young Bell] William Moseley!

37:56.540 --> 37:57.922
Dad?

37:58.022 --> 38:00.465
It's a gift that comes
with responsibility,
Bellwether.

38:01.786 --> 38:04.209
If you don't take care
of the things you love,

38:04.309 --> 38:06.312
you lose them.

38:15.363 --> 38:17.366
[young Bell]
Don't fight the toad, Bell.

38:28.179 --> 38:30.322
Indigo?

38:30.422 --> 38:31.523
No, Mum, don't.

38:31.623 --> 38:33.486
[gasps]

38:33.586 --> 38:35.588
[dramatic music playing]

38:38.872 --> 38:40.875

[sinister music playing]

39:12.314 --> 39:14.797
[panting]

39:19.122 --> 39:22.306
Stop running and follow me
to the lighthouse.

39:22.406 --> 39:25.110
I can't go there.

39:25.210 --> 39:27.212
It's a dream.
You can go anywhere.

39:39.548 --> 39:41.811
[sirens echoing distantly]

39:41.911 --> 39:43.913
Cammie.

39:46.276 --> 39:48.278
This isn't about you.

39:48.759 --> 39:50.061
[hand thuds]

39:50.161 --> 39:52.163
[banging]

39:53.725 --> 39:55.728
[thunder rumbles]

39:59.372 --> 40:01.375
Oh.

40:03.257 --> 40:04.559
Pay attention, Bell.

40:04.659 --> 40:06.661
You can manage that, right?

40:12.789 --> 40:14.972
[gasps] Oh!

40:15.072 --> 40:16.093
I've got it.

40:16.193 --> 40:19.377
The toad told me
who Vida was sleeping with.

40:19.477 --> 40:21.380
Dude,
it's been like five minutes.
This shit lasts for--

40:21.480 --> 40:23.382
[flies buzzing]

40:23.482 --> 40:24.584
Bell?

40:24.684 --> 40:26.025
I need Cammie.

40:26.125 --> 40:28.128
[mellow music playing]

40:30.971 --> 40:34.035
Hey, hey, hey.
You sure about this?

40:34.135 --> 40:36.278
You're sure she was having
an affair with Sam Lund?

40:36.378 --> 40:38.381
The Wi-Fi network
that we couldn't track,

40:39.021 --> 40:40.203
it's on his billboard.

40:40.303 --> 40:42.866
"Dream Big, Live Bigger."
The eights are B's.

40:43.987 --> 40:45.209
Well, at least
she had good taste.

40:45.309 --> 40:47.672
You're awfully cruel
for a unicorn, don't you think?

40:50.035 --> 40:52.458
I-- I don't even wanna know.

40:52.558 --> 40:54.421
But you do know he's here.

40:54.521 --> 40:57.024
Yeah, yeah, Bitty's ex-husband
knows a guy whose third wife

40:57.124 --> 40:58.826
is Sam Lund's
assistant's sister.

40:58.926 --> 41:01.750
Listen, Bell.
Before we do this,

41:01.850 --> 41:03.852
finding the truth
about someone you love

41:04.813 --> 41:06.956
doesn't always end well.

41:07.056 --> 41:09.059
Oh, you beautiful unicorn,
I know it, but...

41:10.781 --> 41:12.763
I can't help it. [chuckles]

41:12.863 --> 41:14.866
Okay. All right, come on.

41:16.668 --> 41:18.691
Excuse me.

41:18.791 --> 41:20.793
All right, clear a path.
Thank you.

41:21.794 --> 41:24.778
-Boggsville PD.
-Whoa.

41:24.878 --> 41:26.941
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You okay?

41:27.041 --> 41:28.943
-[mumbling]
-Can you do this?

41:29.043 --> 41:32.988
Fort Walton Beach.
Hallandale Beach.

41:33.088 --> 41:35.512
Highland Beach.

41:35.612 --> 41:39.737
Holmes Beach.

41:41.619 --> 41:43.782
There. Hey!

41:45.103 --> 41:49.128
You cuckolded me,
you god damn bastard!

41:49.228 --> 41:51.291
I'm talking to you,
you Packsaddley devil!

41:51.391 --> 41:52.773
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Bell, calm down.

41:52.873 --> 41:55.176
I will not calm down.
This man seduced my wife.

41:55.276 --> 41:56.578
Maybe he killed her.
I don't know.

41:56.678 --> 41:58.540
But I am owed some answers,

41:58.640 --> 42:00.102
and he has horns!

42:00.202 --> 42:03.186
Everyone, this man has horns!

42:03.286 --> 42:04.548
[crowd muttering]

42:04.648 --> 42:06.109
He doesn't have horns, does he?

42:06.209 --> 42:08.212
Mm, not so much.

42:09.534 --> 42:11.356
Bell Prescott.

42:11.456 --> 42:13.458
Vida's husband.

42:17.503 --> 42:19.506
Mm.

42:20.547 --> 42:22.550
J'accuse.

42:23.551 --> 42:25.213
Bell! Hey!

42:25.313 --> 42:26.455
[both struggling]

42:26.555 --> 42:27.456
Hey, hey!

-[gunshots]
-[crowd shouts]

42:30.039 --> 42:32.382
-[guns cocking]
-Everybody freeze!

42:32.482 --> 42:34.224
-[man] Don't move!
-Sammy?

42:34.324 --> 42:36.988
-Oh, my God. Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

42:37.088 --> 42:40.272
Apparently
this gentleman thinks
that I slept with his wife.

42:40.372 --> 42:42.154
[quirky music playing]

42:42.254 --> 42:44.257
Wait, you're...

42:45.698 --> 42:47.841
Paul and I
have been together for years.

42:47.941 --> 42:49.944
We have two kids.

42:52.667 --> 42:54.670
So you and Vida weren't...

42:55.791 --> 42:57.974
She logged into your Wi-Fi
regularly.

42:58.074 --> 43:00.777
Yeah, well, she was looking
to rent a seafront apartment,

43:00.877 --> 43:02.660
and she had
very particular tastes.

43:02.760 --> 43:04.762
An apartment? But--

43:07.886 --> 43:08.787
Oh.

43:08.887 --> 43:10.029
Yeah.

43:10.129 --> 43:12.131
She was looking to move out.

43:12.492 --> 43:14.494
Go figure.

43:17.338 --> 43:19.340
Okay. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
We're done here.

43:20.221 --> 43:22.224
Drop it.

43:28.031 --> 43:30.054
Sorry, Bell.

43:30.154 --> 43:32.336
I know this hurts.

43:32.436 --> 43:34.799
Maybe it was always
as simple as the police said.

43:36.321 --> 43:38.764
We had a fight,
she ran to the swamp,
and that's that.

43:41.007 --> 43:43.009
Nothing more.

43:46.774 --> 43:49.558
[line ringing]

43:49.658 --> 43:53.362
-It's Sam. Sam Lund.
-The real estate guy?

43:53.462 --> 43:55.245
You told me if I ever had
a certain visitor

43:55.345 --> 43:56.927
asking questions to call you.

43:57.027 --> 43:58.449
Yes.

43:58.549 --> 43:59.690
I'm calling.

43:59.790 --> 44:01.793
[foreboding music playing]

44:06.479 --> 44:08.742
Can we visit
the Prescotts again?

44:08.842 --> 44:10.944
Um, we'll see.

44:11.044 --> 44:13.868
-I like Ms. Millicent.
-I know.

44:13.968 --> 44:15.970
Where's my grandma?

44:16.891 --> 44:18.393
I'm not sure, bug.

44:18.493 --> 44:20.356
How come
we don't have any pictures?

44:20.456 --> 44:22.458
You mean like family pictures?

44:25.382 --> 44:27.385
Well, you see, um...

44:27.785 --> 44:29.607
the thing is,

44:29.707 --> 44:32.731
some people,
they like to live in the past.

44:32.831 --> 44:36.376
But me, I like it now
because I have you.

44:36.476 --> 44:37.417
[both chuckle]

44:37.517 --> 44:40.761
And we have each other,
and that's all I need.

44:42.243 --> 44:44.826
So good night, doggie lovey.
Mwah!

44:44.926 --> 44:46.548
[both giggling]

44:46.648 --> 44:50.313
Good night, ruffly guy.

44:50.413 --> 44:52.195
-He's a stegosaurus.
-Oh, that's right.

44:52.295 --> 44:53.597
I knew that. I knew that.

44:53.697 --> 44:55.920
-Hmm?
-Aw, okay, good night.

44:56.020 --> 44:58.022
Mm. [kisses]

45:03.830 --> 45:06.072
Yeah, it just says
no recent sightings.

45:08.916 --> 45:11.319
Can you just put me
on an alert list
if anything changes?

45:14.122 --> 45:16.125
I appreciate it.

45:19.850 --> 45:21.852
[knocking]

45:26.578 --> 45:28.601
Get lost on the way
to the porn star's house?

45:28.701 --> 45:30.703
-We need to talk.
-Twice a year.

45:31.344 --> 45:33.967
Christmas and birthdays.

45:34.067 --> 45:37.051
I know,
and I wanna change that.

45:37.151 --> 45:39.094
What are you--
Did you find God or something?

45:39.194 --> 45:41.196
It's been a tough year, okay?

45:42.878 --> 45:44.821
The paper's losing money.

45:44.921 --> 45:46.923
Nobody believes
in news anymore.

45:48.285 --> 45:50.287
I had a heart attack.

45:51.809 --> 45:53.832
I'm fine.

45:53.932 --> 45:56.515
But I had to make some changes.

45:56.615 --> 45:58.317
I was thinking that things
could be different.

45:58.417 --> 46:00.921
This is not about
what's best for me.

46:01.021 --> 46:02.483
This is about
what's best for Tyler.

46:02.583 --> 46:03.604
Hmm.

46:03.704 --> 46:06.267
I'm asking you nicely,
Cammie, this time.

46:08.190 --> 46:09.211
What is that supposed to mean?

46:09.311 --> 46:11.313
It means I'm asking me-to-you.

46:12.515 --> 46:14.457
But if you make me
ask you officially,

46:14.557 --> 46:16.420
if we have to walk
into a courtroom,

46:16.520 --> 46:18.542
what name would you use,
exactly,

46:18.642 --> 46:20.645
since we both know
Cammie Lorde is made up?

46:22.567 --> 46:23.829
Leave.

46:23.929 --> 46:26.072
Your secrets are safe, Cam.

46:26.172 --> 46:27.634
I just wanna see him.

46:27.734 --> 46:29.736
[soft dramatic music playing]

46:33.941 --> 46:36.425
[both panting]

46:40.470 --> 46:43.253
Come on, Bell,
finish what you started
for once in your life.

46:43.353 --> 46:44.895
Shut up.

46:44.995 --> 46:46.697
Do you hear me?

46:46.797 --> 46:48.780
Shut the hell up.

46:48.880 --> 46:51.603
[both panting]

46:54.968 --> 46:57.110
-[man] Am I interrupting?
-[gasps]

46:57.210 --> 46:58.752
Papa?

46:58.852 --> 47:00.855
[curious music playing]

47:02.056 --> 47:04.059
Everything okay?

47:04.820 --> 47:06.162
Yeah, fine.

I knocked. No one answered.

47:08.705 --> 47:10.707

47:11.228 --> 47:13.230

So you heard I'm looking
into Vida's past, that it?

47:18.877 --> 47:20.980
You here to defend
your daughter's honor?

47:21.080 --> 47:23.082
No, not at all.

47:24.444 --> 47:26.447
I'm here to tell you the truth.
