<i>Previously on "Manhattan"...</i>

00:02.227 --> 00:04.662
Charlie: <i>They said it'd
be just like Cambridge.</i>

00:04.696 --> 00:07.398
-<i> Harvard with sand.</i>
- Charlie, this doesn't look like Cambridge.

00:07.432 --> 00:09.233
Akley: <i>You're looking at the best
equipped lab in the country.</i>

00:09.235 --> 00:12.202
Two Van de Graaff accelerators,
our own cyclotron.

00:12.237 --> 00:13.988
You're building
an atomic bomb.

00:14.039 --> 00:16.040
Is that Frank Winter?

00:16.074 --> 00:18.575
<i>He's got a band of misfits
working on an alternate design.</i>

00:18.577 --> 00:22.079
Whatever we're doing here,
please tell me it's worth it.

00:22.130 --> 00:24.415
I don't know what's gotten into
him since we've gotten here.

00:24.417 --> 00:28.168
Half the time he's brooding and the
other half it's like our honeymoon.

00:28.219 --> 00:29.753
Liza: <i>They're all
like that at first.</i>

00:29.755 --> 00:31.221
<i>It's easier than talking.</i>

00:31.256 --> 00:32.923
<i>Eventually they stop
doing either.</i>

00:32.974 --> 00:34.894
- What?
- No, you can't go to school in New York.

00:34.926 --> 00:37.094
So I'm just supposed to stay
here in this prison camp?

00:37.096 --> 00:39.730
<i>Get knocked up by one of the guards?
Why are we even here?</i>

00:39.764 --> 00:41.265
Everything is a secret.

00:41.316 --> 00:42.599
There's something
I need to tell you.

00:42.651 --> 00:44.685
There's a problem
with Thin Man.

00:44.736 --> 00:47.404
We're dead in the water. So what are we gonna do about it?

00:47.439 --> 00:49.273
What happened between you?

00:49.324 --> 00:51.692
He asked me to do things
no one ever should.

00:51.743 --> 00:54.445
I don't know
who Charlie is anymore.

00:54.447 --> 00:57.414
- I'm going home, Charlie.
- The army won't allow it.

00:57.449 --> 01:00.117
They will if we're divorced.

01:00.168 --> 01:01.585
Are you gonna invite me in?

01:01.619 --> 01:04.087
You can whisper
fission rates in my ear.

01:04.122 --> 01:07.041
<i>Tell me secrets you can't
share with your wife.</i>

01:07.092 --> 01:08.792
There's a leak in this lab.

01:08.843 --> 01:10.627
Someone's been smuggling technical
schematics off the Hill.

01:10.629 --> 01:12.296
My mother died yesterday.

01:12.347 --> 01:14.631
Your new office will be waiting
for you when you get back.

01:14.633 --> 01:17.267
I won't be gone long. They said I
wouldn't have to meet in person.

01:17.302 --> 01:19.803
Only under
extraordinary conditions.

01:19.805 --> 01:22.139
Implosion is taking
center stage.

01:22.141 --> 01:24.641
-<i> They think that you're a spy.</i>
- Charlie.

01:24.693 --> 01:26.310
<i>Your wife is sitting
in the next room.</i>

01:26.361 --> 01:30.147
She has been betraying you for
months with your neighbor.

01:30.149 --> 01:33.283
Frank, it's Charlie. They're
shipping him off the Hill.

01:33.318 --> 01:35.652
- They think he's a traitor.
- What's wrong?

01:35.654 --> 01:37.654
We're building an atomic bomb

01:37.706 --> 01:41.658
that will explode with the
power of 20,000 tons of TNT.

01:43.461 --> 01:45.662
I've done things
I'm not proud of,

01:45.664 --> 01:48.832
but I swear I did all of it
with you and Callie in mind.

01:48.834 --> 01:52.302
A few months ago, a physicist
from another design group and I

01:52.337 --> 01:54.338
<i>engaged in
a secret conspiracy</i>

01:54.389 --> 01:57.674
to co-opt the resources
of his group for implosion.

01:57.676 --> 02:00.844
<i>Akley promoted Charlie Isaacs
to cover up our tracks.</i>

02:00.846 --> 02:03.680
<i>They think he is a spy,
but he had no idea.</i>

02:03.682 --> 02:06.683
You sold the President
of the United States

02:06.735 --> 02:09.019
a Buck Rogers fantasy.

02:09.020 --> 02:10.937
There is a backup plan.

02:10.989 --> 02:12.689
<i>The director of
the implosion group</i>

02:12.691 --> 02:14.608
<i>is one of the brightest

02:14.659 --> 02:16.527
<i>This is Dr. Charles Isaacs.</i>

Charlie!
Just wait! Please.

02:50.563 --> 02:54.565
So the dawn--
the dawn of the atomic age

02:54.599 --> 02:58.268
being ushered in by a Jewish
cardshark whose family crash-landed

02:58.303 --> 03:00.571
- on the American shores less than 50 years ago.
- You shouldn't be down here.

03:00.573 --> 03:02.156
No, just one quote.
One quote.

03:02.207 --> 03:06.493
Would you compare this
to Promethean theft?

03:06.544 --> 03:08.378
Man stealing fire
from the gods?

03:08.413 --> 03:10.380
- Or is it more--
- They pay you by the metaphor?

03:10.415 --> 03:11.665
Hey!

03:11.716 --> 03:13.951
Escort Edward R. Murrow
here to Site B!

03:13.985 --> 03:15.919
If he comes back, you have
permission to shoot him.

What? God.

03:19.324 --> 03:22.593

Whoa! Charlie! Charlie!

03:25.230 --> 03:27.397
Fritz! You're here.

03:27.432 --> 03:30.400
- Yeah.
- I'm glad.

03:30.435 --> 03:33.770
Grab a radio. Make sure the circuit
cables don't short out in the rain.

03:33.772 --> 03:35.772
Whoa, whoa! We're supposed to
meet 10 weather conditions

03:35.824 --> 03:37.107
before we pull the trigger.

03:37.109 --> 03:39.193
Visibility over 45 miles,

03:39.244 --> 03:41.912
- humidity below 85%--
- Yeah, I read the report.

03:41.946 --> 03:45.199
You got to talk to the
colonel, delay the test.

03:45.250 --> 03:47.850
The colonel and I aren't
on the best of terms.

03:50.455 --> 03:52.289
Look, at any given moment,

03:52.340 --> 03:54.958
there are 3,000 thunderstorms
somewhere on the planet.

03:55.009 --> 03:56.627
No, no.
This one is special.

03:56.629 --> 03:59.963
Gulf air at 17,000 feet,
two inversion layers.

04:00.014 --> 04:02.766
They're not going to call
the game for rain.

04:02.800 --> 04:04.801
Let's just hope
it blows over.

04:04.853 --> 04:08.055
It'll blow radioactive fallout
from Roswell to Socorro.

04:08.106 --> 04:09.439
I'm sympathetic.
The Army isn't.

04:09.474 --> 04:11.594
Either way,
I take responsibility.

The War Department

The president wrote us a

You're handing the project

07:48.095 --> 07:50.255
It's Isaacs.
Charlie McCarthy's a--

07:50.264 --> 07:53.049
A wooden dummy
on a ventriloquist's knee

07:53.100 --> 07:54.684
with Robert's hand
up your ass.

07:55.519 --> 07:57.053
We have a working design.

07:57.104 --> 07:59.889
And in the space
between a working design

07:59.891 --> 08:03.059
and a weapon that works,
empires burn.

08:03.110 --> 08:06.062
So, Dr. Isaacs,
how soon can you deliver?

08:06.113 --> 08:08.531
A month? A year? 10?

08:10.117 --> 08:12.285
I don't, um...

08:13.904 --> 08:16.122
Well, I'd have to, uh...

08:20.945 --> 08:22.712
Dr. Oppenheimer.

08:22.747 --> 08:24.914
Do you ride, Charlie?

08:24.916 --> 08:28.752
I'm a Jew

08:28.803 --> 08:30.503
When a horse
won't take the saddle,

08:30.554 --> 08:32.922
you can send it
to the glue factory.

08:32.924 --> 08:34.557
It's not an option
with physicists.

08:34.592 --> 08:37.260
They're still in there
debating the science.

08:37.311 --> 08:38.928
Not a lot of fans
of implosion.

08:38.929 --> 08:40.764
<i>20 old men out of 2,000.</i>

08:40.765 --> 08:42.265
Win the confidence

08:45.936 --> 08:48.271
You gonna make an
announcement to the staff?

08:48.322 --> 08:49.773
You are.

08:58.332 --> 09:01.117
Where's Frank Winter?

09:01.168 --> 09:02.952
It's just implosion
is Frank's baby.

09:02.954 --> 09:05.121
You're going to
have to deliver it.

09:05.172 --> 09:06.589
In 50 years, no one will know

09:06.624 --> 09:08.124
the name Frank Winter,
but yours--

09:08.175 --> 09:10.535
I can't take credit
for someone else's work.

09:13.597 --> 09:15.765
You made your career stealing
the work of another physicist

09:15.800 --> 09:17.434
and passing it off
as your own.

09:21.188 --> 09:23.807
Glen Babbive gave
an interesting exit interview.

09:35.820 --> 09:37.787
Then why'd you pick me
for the job?

09:39.206 --> 09:41.124
Saddle the horse, Charlie.

09:41.158 --> 09:44.598
I assure you, there's more
profit in moving forward.

09:46.464 --> 09:48.214
( Knocks )

09:51.385 --> 09:52.669
Dr. Winter?

09:52.671 --> 09:54.471
He hasn't been home
in two days.

09:54.505 --> 09:56.639
He's probably in his office
hiding behind an equation.

09:56.674 --> 09:57.841
Ma'am, we're not here
for your husband.

09:57.892 --> 09:59.843
We're here for your things.

09:59.894 --> 10:01.845
- My--
- Personal effects.

10:01.896 --> 10:03.513
Furniture stays

10:03.515 --> 10:06.182
We have you slotted for a
duplex apartment in Row H.

10:06.233 --> 10:08.685
In regard to your husband.

10:12.239 --> 10:15.191
What does this mean,
"reassigned"?

10:15.242 --> 10:17.610
Who reassigned him?

10:17.661 --> 10:19.696
He put in for a voluntary
transfer three days ago.

10:19.698 --> 10:22.198
- Where?
- Even if I--

10:22.249 --> 10:23.700
You're telling me my husband

10:23.751 --> 10:26.202
has abandoned his family
with no explanation,

10:26.253 --> 10:27.370
not even
a forwarding address?

10:27.372 --> 10:28.621
I'm sorry.

10:28.672 --> 10:29.873
We'll be back with boxes.

10:46.690 --> 10:48.858
That son of a bitch
always was crazy

indeterminate variables.

10:52.029 --> 10:56.699
C-A-L-L-I-E.

10:58.786 --> 11:01.070
I wonder how long before
Frank's daughter turns 18.

11:01.072 --> 11:03.740
I thought you packed off,
Crosley, for Omaha.

11:03.791 --> 11:05.492
Or was it Idaho?

11:05.543 --> 11:07.877
Dayton, Ohio, actually.

11:07.912 --> 11:11.047
Next stop on my whistle tour
of American boomtowns.

11:11.081 --> 11:13.883
Doesn't make any sense.

11:13.918 --> 11:16.669
Oppenheimer hands Frank the
project on a silver platter

11:16.720 --> 11:19.422
and he skips town for some
kind of secret promotion?

11:19.424 --> 11:21.424
Really?

11:21.475 --> 11:23.693
That's what you lured me
here to talk about, Fritz?

11:23.727 --> 11:25.428
- Frank's career path?
- Lure you?

11:25.430 --> 11:27.263
<i>What are you talking about?
I didn't lure you.</i>

11:27.314 --> 11:29.482
- Yes, you did.
- No, I got a note from--

11:31.318 --> 11:32.902
Oh, it's the duchess

11:32.937 --> 11:35.271
and the boy with
his finger in the dike.

11:35.322 --> 11:37.722
Just give him five minutes.

11:39.109 --> 11:40.527
Charlie: <i>There's going
to be an announcement.</i>

11:40.578 --> 11:41.978
I'm taking over
the implosion group.

11:41.996 --> 11:43.413
Fritz: You?

11:43.447 --> 11:45.698
None of the Indian maids
available, eh?

11:45.749 --> 11:47.917
I need to reach Frank.
Have your heard anything?

11:47.952 --> 11:49.586
No more than Fritzy here,
I gather.

11:49.620 --> 11:51.120
They haven't told you
about their little

11:51.172 --> 11:52.755
scientific ménage à
trois, have they?

11:52.790 --> 11:54.290
Paul.

11:54.341 --> 11:56.926
So why would you
want to find Frank?

11:56.961 --> 11:59.546
You're the force of nature that
fills up the Frank-shaped vacuum.

11:59.597 --> 12:00.930
He's just trying to help.

12:00.965 --> 12:02.298
I see.
It's for her benefit.

12:02.349 --> 12:04.851
A bit of Kabuki theater
to impress a girl.

12:06.520 --> 12:08.438
Well, if I see Frank in Ohio,

12:08.472 --> 12:11.140
I'll be sure to send
along your regards.

12:14.311 --> 12:17.313
( Glass shatters )

12:17.364 --> 12:19.983
What did he mean?
What's a ménage à trois?

12:21.368 --> 12:22.648
I'm not trying
to impress anyone.

12:22.653 --> 12:24.954
I was in a bind.
Now I'm not.

12:24.989 --> 12:26.956
I think Frank helped me out

12:26.991 --> 12:29.742
and he's paying the price.

12:29.793 --> 12:32.328
And Oppenheimer
won't tell you where he is?

12:32.379 --> 12:34.797
We're not even sure he knows.

12:34.832 --> 12:36.132
Well, somebody does.

13:10.417 --> 13:14.370
Hey, X-4.
What's his name?

13:14.421 --> 13:16.372
That information
is not in our files.

13:16.423 --> 13:18.503
Well, I got to talk to him.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.051
<i>( Knocks on door )</i>

13:34.108 --> 13:36.609
- Hello.
- Abby.

13:38.062 --> 13:40.063
Um, he's not here.

13:42.232 --> 13:44.033
What? You want to
check under the bed?

13:44.068 --> 13:45.568
I'm not here to see Charlie.

13:55.462 --> 13:57.830
Is it true that you were
going to have a baby

13:57.881 --> 13:58.915
and then you didn't?

14:01.251 --> 14:03.086
Charlie told you that?

14:04.088 --> 14:06.839
Did you take care of it?

14:06.890 --> 14:08.257
What is this?

14:10.644 --> 14:14.597
Trust me, Helen, if I had any
friends here to turn to,

14:14.648 --> 14:16.265
any friends here at all...

14:18.902 --> 14:20.436
I need to know how
you went about doing it.

14:20.487 --> 14:22.271
Why would you want to do
a thing like that,

14:22.273 --> 14:24.473
Mrs. Ladies' Home Journal?

14:25.909 --> 14:27.110
It's private.

14:27.161 --> 14:29.662
I need to get dressed.

14:36.670 --> 14:38.671
Charlie wasn't
the only one who cheated.

14:40.524 --> 14:41.874
And he found out.

14:41.925 --> 14:44.293
You had an affair?

14:44.295 --> 14:47.096
Who's the guy?

14:47.131 --> 14:49.298
You don't know him.

14:49.300 --> 14:51.934
- But he got you pregnant.
- It's Charlie's.

14:56.523 --> 14:57.857
You sure?

14:59.693 --> 15:01.144
Yes, I'm sure.

15:06.950 --> 15:10.319
I had an abortion
two years ago in New Jersey.

15:10.321 --> 15:12.989
Doctor's probably practicing
medicine in a jail cell.

15:12.991 --> 15:14.907
But if you needed one now,

15:14.958 --> 15:16.659
you must have some idea
of where you'd go.

15:16.710 --> 15:18.161
You know it's a felony.

15:22.966 --> 15:24.133
Some of the girls in the dorm

15:24.168 --> 15:26.502
have been to a clinic
in Santa Fe

15:26.553 --> 15:29.505
near the bus stop
on Junction.

15:29.556 --> 15:32.175
You're supposed to say
you have obstructed menses.

15:35.562 --> 15:37.346
Did it hurt?

15:41.985 --> 15:44.520
Listen, Abby,

15:44.571 --> 15:47.273
I don't regret it.

15:48.024 --> 15:49.425
But you will.

15:57.367 --> 15:58.751
Do you love Charlie?

16:02.589 --> 16:04.207
Then you won't tell him.

16:19.022 --> 16:20.022
Woman on phone:
<i>Operator.</i>

16:20.057 --> 16:22.024
Yeah, I need an outside line.

16:22.059 --> 16:23.893
<i>Where to?</i>

16:23.944 --> 16:26.195
The Soviet consul
in New York.

16:26.230 --> 16:28.981
<i>I-- I'm not authorized
to make that call.</i>

16:29.032 --> 16:30.733
I'm authorizing
you right now.

16:30.735 --> 16:33.102
<i>Sir, even trying
to telephone the Soviets,</i>

16:33.137 --> 16:35.777
<i>you'll get yourself hauled into the
office of the secretary of war.</i>

16:35.789 --> 16:37.406
Do you have any idea
who you're talking to?

16:37.408 --> 16:39.792
<i>I-- no.</i>

16:41.628 --> 16:43.996
You got a pencil?

16:44.047 --> 16:46.749
My badge number is X-4.

17:02.613 --> 17:04.313
(Indistinct distant chatter)

17:06.238 --> 17:09.073
Do you sleep closer to the door
when you're home with Abby?

17:10.709 --> 17:13.044
What?

17:13.078 --> 17:15.713
People always end up
on the same side of the bed.

17:15.747 --> 17:20.550
It's like a designated
parking spot.

17:21.386 --> 17:23.471
It's old habit.

17:28.477 --> 17:30.557
Your marriage
is an old habit, too.

17:32.114 --> 17:33.781
<i>People fall back into it.</i>

17:36.118 --> 17:38.336
When's the last time
you saw Abby?

17:40.789 --> 17:43.758
In 36 hours...

17:43.792 --> 17:47.295
I need to lay out my vision

17:47.346 --> 17:49.297
for the future of the project

17:49.348 --> 17:51.766
to 2,000 physicists.

17:51.800 --> 17:53.601
I got nothing.

17:56.972 --> 18:00.452
Delay the announcement till we
figure out what to do about Frank.

18:01.477 --> 18:04.946
Agent X-4 seems to be
on permanent vacation.

18:04.980 --> 18:07.482
Why don't you just
tell the truth?

18:07.533 --> 18:09.784
Stand up in front
of the entire tech area

18:09.818 --> 18:13.454
and tell them G-2 made one of
the group heads disappear?

18:15.491 --> 18:18.159
Probably stick me in whatever
hole they stuck Frank,

18:18.161 --> 18:21.579
then you'd have to
run implosion.

18:21.630 --> 18:23.798
Why is that funny?

18:23.832 --> 18:27.335
I probably know the physics
better than you do.

18:27.386 --> 18:30.171
You think you could hold your
own against Oppenheimer?

18:30.173 --> 18:33.591
Those bloodsuckers
in the senior leadership?

18:33.642 --> 18:36.594
You think you can?
Oppenheimer picked you

18:36.645 --> 18:39.013
because he knows
that he can control you.

18:39.015 --> 18:42.400
All right.
You know, never mind.

18:44.403 --> 18:46.404
I have a speech to write.

18:47.656 --> 18:50.825

19:44.247 --> 19:46.047
Yeah, Meeks.

19:46.081 --> 19:48.249
This isn't the Waldorf.
We're not bellboys.

19:48.251 --> 19:49.584
What are you doing

19:49.635 --> 19:51.168
It's moving day.

You're not the Oberfuhrer.

20:47.526 --> 20:50.945
Is there any sign
of Colonel Cox?

20:50.979 --> 20:52.947
Colonel Cox
has been redeployed

20:52.981 --> 20:55.316
to a post more suitable
to his talents.

20:55.318 --> 20:57.438
Does he have those?
Talents?

20:59.321 --> 21:01.122
So that would make you...

21:01.156 --> 21:03.124
Colonel Emmett Darrow.

21:03.158 --> 21:05.638
The king is dead.
Long live the king.

21:07.129 --> 21:09.413
Well, I've squandered
enough of your time.

21:09.464 --> 21:11.332
High priests
at the security desk

21:11.334 --> 21:14.335
tell me my transfer form
is missing a signature.

21:14.337 --> 21:16.754
Leave it with the girl.

21:16.805 --> 21:19.140
All I need
is a drop of ink, sir.

21:19.174 --> 21:20.975
Dayton site expected me
two days ago.

21:21.009 --> 21:24.312
I won't bore you with
the technical subtleties.

21:24.346 --> 21:29.016
Harvesting polonium-210
for the neutron initiators.

21:29.018 --> 21:31.152
Dayton is adequately staffed.

21:31.186 --> 21:33.186
This hill,
on the other hand...

21:34.573 --> 21:35.906
is not.

21:38.360 --> 21:40.778
Sir, I can't stay
on this hill.

21:40.829 --> 21:42.446
It's a personnel matter.

21:42.497 --> 21:44.532
- Personnel?
- Personal.

21:44.583 --> 21:46.334
I can't work
for Charlie Isaacs.

21:46.368 --> 21:48.836
<i>It seems we both fancied
the same woman.</i>

21:52.207 --> 21:54.287
Would you close
the door, please?

22:09.057 --> 22:10.358
Get down on your knees.

22:13.862 --> 22:16.063
You're pulling my leg.
( chuckles )

22:16.114 --> 22:18.566
No one can see you.

22:18.617 --> 22:20.401
Take a knee.

22:20.403 --> 22:22.870
<i>Or did you change your mind
about the transfer?</i>

22:34.383 --> 22:37.585
Now...

22:37.636 --> 22:39.720
ask Jesus for forgiveness.

22:42.090 --> 22:44.425
I'm sorry?

22:44.427 --> 22:45.893
Jesus.

22:50.649 --> 22:53.401
Forgive me, Jesus.

22:53.435 --> 22:56.904
And what is the nature
of your sin?

22:56.938 --> 22:58.239
I don't know.

22:58.273 --> 23:02.109
Yes, you do.
It's weakness.

23:05.113 --> 23:08.699
God buried an atom under
a million tons of rock

23:08.750 --> 23:10.618
so that America
could split it in two

23:10.669 --> 23:12.586
and redraw
the maps of the world.

23:12.621 --> 23:15.873
And you want
to run off to Dayton

23:15.924 --> 23:19.084
because some girl didn't
ask you to the prom?

23:40.532 --> 23:43.684
Half the Hill woke up with eviction
papers tacked to our doors

23:43.718 --> 23:46.287
by order of the office
of the colonel.

23:46.321 --> 23:48.489
You picked a hell
of a week to leave town.

23:48.491 --> 23:51.492
I mean, not that you
picked-- oh, Jesus.

23:51.494 --> 23:54.929
You should talk to Jeannie.
She's got two dead parents.

23:54.963 --> 23:58.666
Jim, I'm so sorry
about your mother.

23:58.717 --> 24:00.301
They won't give you
more time?

24:00.335 --> 24:03.304
Uh, she'd want me here
serving my country.

24:03.338 --> 24:05.139
I don't even know
who we're serving.

24:05.173 --> 24:07.675
- Frank's gone.
- What?

24:07.726 --> 24:09.677
- Where?
- I don't know.

24:09.728 --> 24:11.808
But I know it's not good.

24:24.860 --> 24:27.161
So you're going to give it to
her on a bench in the plaza?

24:27.195 --> 24:28.946
I saved up for a hotel room.

24:28.997 --> 24:31.165
She's a virgin, right?

24:31.199 --> 24:34.668
Don't forget to sprinkle rose
petals on the bedspread.

24:34.703 --> 24:37.171
On E-3 salary?

24:37.205 --> 24:39.340
He'll be lucky
if the room has a bed.

24:39.374 --> 24:41.542
Liza:
<i>Where's my daughter?</i>

24:41.544 --> 24:43.177
Mrs. Winter-- Doctor.

24:43.211 --> 24:45.713
I think she's on an overnight
with the Mason Scouts.

24:45.747 --> 24:49.300
Yes, she was. And then she went
AWOL, apparently to meet you.

24:49.351 --> 24:51.352
Callie and I
had social plans.

24:51.386 --> 24:53.554
She took an early bus and we
were going to meet for dinner.

24:53.556 --> 24:55.973
Where?

24:56.024 --> 24:57.308
A restaurant?

24:57.959 --> 25:00.227
I'll save you a bus ticket.

25:10.238 --> 25:12.573
Are you going somewhere?

25:12.607 --> 25:14.041
Get in the car.

25:15.744 --> 25:17.962
<i>( Door opens, closes )</i>

25:26.054 --> 25:28.055
<i>( door opens )</i>

25:38.266 --> 25:40.351
I see you got my message.

25:40.402 --> 25:43.020
Prince of implosion.

25:43.071 --> 25:45.606
I'd have thought you'd
have better things to do

25:45.608 --> 25:47.942
than play grab-ass
with a telephone.

25:47.993 --> 25:51.028
What's wrong?
OSS can't take a joke?

25:51.079 --> 25:52.613
Strategic Services
is a clubhouse

25:52.615 --> 25:54.782
for overbred schoolboys.

25:54.833 --> 25:57.785
I serve at the pleasure
of a humbler master.

25:57.836 --> 25:59.837
General Groves.

26:01.089 --> 26:02.673
Freedom.

26:03.842 --> 26:05.626
<i>Nice office.</i>

26:05.628 --> 26:08.629
- A lot of turnover.
- Yes, well,

26:08.631 --> 26:11.432
the third time's a charm.

26:11.466 --> 26:12.800
You don't see it yet,
Charlie,

26:12.851 --> 26:14.551
but I am your friend.

26:14.603 --> 26:18.272
Most of my friends
have names.

26:18.306 --> 26:21.475
I want you to tell me the truth.
Can you do that?

26:21.526 --> 26:25.279
What do you think,
I'm some Bela Lugosi spook?

26:25.313 --> 26:28.482
I am the reason you're sitting
behind that desk instead of--

26:28.533 --> 26:30.651
Where?

26:30.653 --> 26:32.119
Where is Frank Winter?

26:32.153 --> 26:34.455
<i>You pack him off
to wherever it was</i>

26:34.489 --> 26:37.825
<i>you were going to send me
to torture him?</i>

26:37.876 --> 26:41.462
Ah, that's what this is.

26:41.496 --> 26:43.797
A soldier's loyalty.

26:43.832 --> 26:47.084
Let me guess. Frank isn't
the man I think he is.

26:47.135 --> 26:48.836
He wasn't.

26:48.887 --> 26:52.006
What about me? Am I the
guy you thought I was?

26:53.892 --> 26:57.311
<i>See, I don't think
you're a spook.</i>

26:57.345 --> 27:00.514
I think you're a bureaucrat.

27:00.516 --> 27:05.352
I think you're the guy at the border
checkpoint asking for papers.

27:06.688 --> 27:08.656
Hmm.

27:15.530 --> 27:19.700
Do you know the Banat
province in eastern Europe

27:19.751 --> 27:22.870
doesn't exist anymore

27:22.872 --> 27:25.205
except on a few old maps?

27:26.708 --> 27:28.125
Before Christ turned up,

27:28.176 --> 27:31.512
it belonged to the Thracians

27:31.546 --> 27:34.348
<i>until the Romans
bled them dry.</i>

27:34.382 --> 27:36.517
Then the Goths,
the Huns, the Gepidae,

27:36.551 --> 27:40.354
the Avars, followed by the
Slavs, then the Magyars.

27:40.388 --> 27:43.857
Four calling birds, three
French hens, I get it.

27:43.892 --> 27:45.526
Then the Hungarians
set up shop

27:45.560 --> 27:48.896
until the Ottoman Turks
cut them down.

27:48.947 --> 27:52.533
That's when
my family arrived.

27:52.567 --> 27:54.234
Merchants.

27:54.285 --> 27:56.904
Salt, mostly.

27:56.955 --> 28:00.541
They fought with the Serbs
to beat back the Turks.

28:00.575 --> 28:02.543
Then the son
of a Bosnian farmer

28:02.577 --> 28:05.829
put a bullet in a Hapsburg
and the world caught fire.

28:05.880 --> 28:09.750
<i>And then it became
the Banat Republic</i>

28:09.752 --> 28:12.970
for all of two weeks.

28:15.223 --> 28:19.560
It was a haven for Jews

28:19.594 --> 28:23.180
until the Axis rolled in
and Hitler...

28:23.231 --> 28:24.765
( laughs )

28:31.773 --> 28:36.193
Hitler solved the Jewish
problem once and for all.

28:36.244 --> 28:38.779
Now the Russians
are knocking at the gate.

28:40.627 --> 28:42.374
When you've lived in a place

28:42.399 --> 28:44.519
where borders
have no meaning,

28:44.546 --> 28:47.965
borders come to mean
a great deal.

28:49.918 --> 28:51.752
20 years I've lived
in this country,

28:51.754 --> 28:55.723
yet still I keep a packed
suitcase by the front door.

28:59.144 --> 29:00.761
Good.

29:02.597 --> 29:05.566
Let's throw it in the car,
go for a drive,

29:05.600 --> 29:07.101
pick up Frank.

29:09.771 --> 29:11.739
He's gone, and he's
never coming back.

29:11.773 --> 29:13.941
What does that mean, gone?

29:18.780 --> 29:20.164
He's dead?

29:22.951 --> 29:24.668
I don't believe you.

29:27.289 --> 29:28.872
You knew the man.

29:28.923 --> 29:31.959
Do you think Frank Winter
would surrender quietly?

29:31.961 --> 29:34.378
Sands shift during wartime.

29:34.429 --> 29:38.132
No one--
no one has tenure.

29:38.183 --> 29:41.969
The ones who survive
are the ones who adapt.

29:44.806 --> 29:47.274
Next time, call me directly.

29:48.643 --> 29:52.646
My name is Avram Fisher.

29:58.653 --> 30:00.154
Where are my manners?

30:00.205 --> 30:03.907
- Congratulations.
- For surviving or adapting?

30:03.958 --> 30:05.492
For the baby.

30:05.494 --> 30:09.213
Mazel tov to you
and your wife.

30:14.052 --> 30:17.187
<i>( Door opens, closes )</i>

30:37.082 --> 30:40.083
You invited Callie to dinner

30:41.034 --> 30:42.402
at a filling station?

30:42.554 --> 30:44.755
Ralph and Betty's Cafe.
This is it.

30:47.308 --> 30:50.060
<i>( Music playing )</i>

30:50.094 --> 30:52.930
( overlapping chatter )

31:02.957 --> 31:04.508
Where's my daughter?

31:18.807 --> 31:20.641
Elena?

31:21.810 --> 31:23.527
<i>( Door opens )</i>

31:26.197 --> 31:27.448
I sent her home.

31:30.318 --> 31:31.952
Where were you?

31:34.656 --> 31:35.823
Out.

31:37.826 --> 31:39.660
-<i> Abby.</i>
- Hmm?

31:39.711 --> 31:41.662
Is there something
that you need to tell me?

31:41.664 --> 31:43.997
You know, Charlie, I think
we dug up all the skeletons

31:43.999 --> 31:45.759
the last time you stopped by.

31:45.800 --> 31:48.418
I'm sure the neighbors
can give you a transcript.

31:48.470 --> 31:50.003
Are you pregnant?

31:59.013 --> 32:00.814
She told you.

32:03.852 --> 32:06.687
I had to hear it
from the Angel of Death.

32:06.738 --> 32:08.655
- What?
- Abby.

32:08.690 --> 32:10.023
Charlie.

32:14.245 --> 32:16.485
You were going to
sign the divorce papers

32:16.498 --> 32:19.199
and sneak out
the back door with Joey?

32:19.250 --> 32:20.834
This is a sign.

32:20.869 --> 32:22.836
I don't believe
in signs, Charlie.

32:22.871 --> 32:24.454
<i>Fine, it's better
than a sign.</i>

32:24.506 --> 32:28.208
It's a chance.

32:28.259 --> 32:29.877
It's too late.

32:34.265 --> 32:36.466
There's a lunatic in Europe

32:36.518 --> 32:39.052
making orphans out of a
thousand Jewish kids a day.

32:39.054 --> 32:41.188
You want two more to grow
up without their father?

32:41.222 --> 32:43.473
You think I don't know
about Europe?

32:43.525 --> 32:45.526
Honestly?

32:53.735 --> 32:58.205
You remember that first
doctor at Mass General?

32:58.239 --> 33:00.874
<i>The one who looked
like Calvin Coolidge?</i>

33:00.909 --> 33:04.912
A medical improbability.
That's what he called it.

33:07.549 --> 33:12.252
And I told you we could raise
Siamese cats for all I care.

33:13.755 --> 33:17.507
But you wanted
a daughter so badly.

33:17.559 --> 33:20.894
We both did.

33:20.929 --> 33:22.930
And you proved
the doctors wrong.

33:27.318 --> 33:31.939
Right out of the gates,
you said it felt like a boy,

33:31.941 --> 33:36.644
and you were right
about that, too.

33:42.917 --> 33:45.085
Thought I'd never
see you again.

33:45.136 --> 33:46.720
I mean, for all I knew,
you were dead.

33:46.755 --> 33:48.389
And then you came in the door

33:48.423 --> 33:52.559
and you said that
I poisoned our marriage.

33:52.594 --> 33:55.345
Listen.

33:55.397 --> 33:59.733
Whatever happened
between me and you

33:59.768 --> 34:03.353
or me and her

34:03.405 --> 34:05.939
- or you and--
- Charlie.

34:07.609 --> 34:10.610
It's not us.

34:10.612 --> 34:13.580
It's this place.

34:13.614 --> 34:15.949
I treated you
like every other jerk

34:15.951 --> 34:18.034
on this hill treats his wife.

34:18.186 --> 34:20.353
I underestimated you.

34:22.891 --> 34:25.225
I forgot what I had.

34:26.895 --> 34:29.062
But there's a kid in there.

34:29.063 --> 34:32.866
He doesn't know
his father screwed up.

34:32.900 --> 34:36.320
His world doesn't
even exist yet.

34:36.371 --> 34:38.739
We can do better.

34:44.913 --> 34:46.547
I can be better.

35:01.763 --> 35:03.564
It feels like a girl.

35:05.433 --> 35:08.235
<i>- ( Music playing )
- ( plates clattering )</i>

35:16.778 --> 35:18.612
Callie's on her way.

35:18.663 --> 35:20.530
Good.

35:20.582 --> 35:23.250
20 minutes, tops. There was
a message at the barracks.

35:23.284 --> 35:25.764
I goofed. I sent her to
the wrong restaurant.

35:27.956 --> 35:29.957
You left it in
your jacket pocket.

35:31.960 --> 35:34.795
So where were you really
going to meet Callie?

35:38.600 --> 35:42.936
Premarital sex
was not invented in 1944.

35:42.971 --> 35:46.291
There's a hotel off the plaza.
We haven't actually--

35:47.809 --> 35:49.776
I wanted to wait
until we were married,

35:49.811 --> 35:51.612
but I...

35:55.817 --> 35:58.151
Do you love her?

36:01.623 --> 36:03.824
She's the most perfect
person I've ever met.

36:07.378 --> 36:08.996
Is she happy?

36:17.639 --> 36:18.839
What?

36:20.842 --> 36:23.343
Callie took some pills
about a month back.

36:23.394 --> 36:25.634
Methyl something.
They were blue.

36:27.181 --> 36:30.817
Methylphenobarbital.

36:30.852 --> 36:32.602
They're mine.

36:32.654 --> 36:35.934
I don't think that she
was really trying to--

36:39.327 --> 36:43.196
She said it runs
in the family.

36:45.033 --> 36:48.201
There was an incident
when we lived in Ithaca.

36:50.204 --> 36:51.872
I made a mistake.

36:53.875 --> 36:57.210
Were you... trying?

36:59.681 --> 37:01.682
I know that Callie's afraid

37:01.716 --> 37:05.852
that she has what I have,

37:05.887 --> 37:09.389
but she's not like me.

37:09.391 --> 37:10.857
I spent half of my life

37:10.892 --> 37:14.227
looking for
a trapdoor out of it.

37:18.700 --> 37:22.069
<i>( Vehicles approaching )</i>

37:35.717 --> 37:37.918
Man: We picked her up
at a hotel in Santa Fe.

37:37.969 --> 37:39.252
Liza:
Callie!

37:39.303 --> 37:41.922
You can thank us
back at the Hill.

37:43.725 --> 37:46.059
Sorry, ma'am.

37:46.094 --> 37:48.054
If you took her away,
I'd never see her again.

37:49.931 --> 37:51.565
It's time to go.

38:13.616 --> 38:17.069
<i>( Door opens, closes )</i>

38:22.241 --> 38:23.659
How do you like your coffee?

38:23.710 --> 38:25.877
In my own living room.

38:25.912 --> 38:27.879
<i>2,000 miles from here.</i>

38:31.467 --> 38:35.220
<i>So what happens when a Nobel
laureate stays out past curfew?</i>

38:35.254 --> 38:37.422
You call out
the 101st Airborne?

38:37.424 --> 38:40.425
A Nobel laureate with a
packed suitcase in his car?

38:40.927 --> 38:43.061
Is that a crime?

38:43.196 --> 38:47.365
<i>Liza Winter, PhD, second
in her class at Barnard.</i>

38:47.367 --> 38:49.367
<i>Not a charm school.</i>

38:49.369 --> 38:51.536
I'm going to assume
you weren't born yesterday.

38:51.587 --> 38:53.672
I hope you'll extend me
the same courtesy.

38:53.706 --> 38:55.540
( Scoffs )

38:55.542 --> 39:00.178
Colonel Darrow, is it?

39:00.213 --> 39:02.798
My husband dragged us here
and now he's gone,

39:02.849 --> 39:04.800
and no one will tell me where
you're sending his check.

39:04.851 --> 39:06.802
So, under the circumstances,

39:06.853 --> 39:10.388
I would be grateful if I could
be released with time served.

39:13.226 --> 39:16.194
Colonel,
I can't spill secrets

39:16.229 --> 39:18.864
I wasn't entrusted with
in the first place.

39:22.235 --> 39:25.403
I understand you have a
job to do, but so do I.

39:25.405 --> 39:27.205
If you let me
just go back to Princeton,

39:27.240 --> 39:28.824
you'll never hear
from me again.

39:28.875 --> 39:30.915
Frank on tape:
<i>...set off a chain reaction</i>

39:30.960 --> 39:35.247
<i>that will explode with the
power of 20,000 tons of TNT.</i>

39:36.883 --> 39:39.634
<i>Powerful enough
to wipe cities off the map.</i>

39:41.387 --> 39:43.839
Liz on tape:
<i>Cities full of people?</i>

39:43.890 --> 39:47.759
You recorded
our conversations?

Frank on tape:
<i>No, the Army will detonate it</i>

39:49.562 --> 39:51.346
<i>someplace where
it can't hurt anyone.</i>

39:51.397 --> 39:53.398
<i>When the Axis sees
what we're capable of,</i>

39:53.432 --> 39:55.267
<i>they'll have no choice.
They will have to surrender...</i>

39:55.269 --> 39:56.434
For how long?

39:56.486 --> 39:58.436
Your husband
is at another site

39:58.438 --> 40:01.606
proving his loyalty
to his country.

40:01.657 --> 40:04.242
You can help him by proving

40:04.277 --> 40:05.610
that you can be a discreet,

40:05.661 --> 40:07.863
productive member
of this community.

40:07.914 --> 40:10.081
Frank: <i>We're writing the

<i>a history of peace.</i>

<i>I've made mistakes.</i>

<i>I've done things
I'm not proud of,</i>

40:26.682 --> 40:29.684
<i>but I swear I did all of it

40:31.304 --> 40:32.804
<i>A few months ago,</i>

40:32.806 --> 40:34.890
<i>a physicist from
another design group</i>

<i>came to me and he told me</i>

40:36.692 --> 40:40.111
<i>that his model wasn't
going to work.</i>

40:40.146 --> 40:44.900
<i>So Reed Akley and I engaged
in a secret conspiracy</i>

40:44.951 --> 40:48.653
<i>to co-opt the resources

40:48.704 --> 40:51.289
<i>You remember Charlie Isaacs?</i>

40:51.324 --> 40:53.909
<i>We set him up
to cover our tracks.</i>

40:53.960 --> 40:56.127
<i>The irony is
the only way we were able</i>

40:56.162 --> 40:58.296
<i>to crack implosion
was by stealing...</i>

40:58.331 --> 41:00.966
I may know what it is
you're building here...

41:03.502 --> 41:06.504
but my daughter does not.

41:06.506 --> 41:09.391
<i>...but he had no idea.</i>

41:53.052 --> 41:56.388

<i>All white badge holders

42:46.272 --> 42:48.406

42:48.441 --> 42:51.242
The Army said Frank was
transferred to another site.

42:51.277 --> 42:52.777
One suit, one shirt,
one necktie,

42:52.828 --> 42:54.779
one pair of shoes?

42:54.830 --> 42:56.781
That's all he took.

42:56.832 --> 43:00.201
All his clothes
are boxed up at the house.

43:00.252 --> 43:01.619
He even left
his security badge.

43:01.621 --> 43:05.540
Does that sound
like a transfer to you?

43:05.591 --> 43:09.260
I don't know what law of
physics he's broken now,

43:09.295 --> 43:10.795
but I think you do.

43:10.846 --> 43:12.097
Man: <i> Ma'am?</i>

43:13.632 --> 43:16.112

It's all right.
Hey, she's fine.

43:49.135 --> 43:50.802
Thanks very much.

43:50.836 --> 43:52.876

43:54.340 --> 43:55.673
Thank you.

43:58.144 --> 44:00.311
Dr. Oppenheimer...

44:00.346 --> 44:04.849
asked me to say a few words
about the road ahead.

44:04.900 --> 44:08.060
But I want to talk about
the road that got us here.

44:09.355 --> 44:11.489
I had a teacher
in St. Louis.

44:11.524 --> 44:15.693
He used to say that science
isn't a quest for truth,

44:15.695 --> 44:20.115
but a process of
correcting your errors.

44:20.166 --> 44:23.366
We've racked up more than
our share on this hill.

44:25.004 --> 44:27.124
And I want to
correct one right now.

44:32.928 --> 44:35.513
The fact that
we're all standing here,

44:35.548 --> 44:37.549
that there is a path forward,

44:37.551 --> 44:39.134
we owe it to one man,

44:39.185 --> 44:40.802
and he isn't
standing here with us.

44:40.853 --> 44:45.640
The implosion model exists
because of Frank Winter.

44:45.691 --> 44:48.726
( Murmuring )

44:48.778 --> 44:52.530
He was the crank
in the wilderness

44:52.565 --> 44:56.151
rubbing two sticks together
when no one believed.

44:56.202 --> 44:59.370
He fed the spark.

44:59.405 --> 45:00.655
He fought off the wolves.

45:00.706 --> 45:04.576
<i>He corrected his errors.</i>

45:07.213 --> 45:09.453
You should be listening
to Frank right now.

45:16.222 --> 45:19.924
But the War Department
has asked him

45:19.975 --> 45:24.062
to take the reins on another
project at another site.

45:24.064 --> 45:26.014
Their gain is our loss.

45:26.065 --> 45:28.566
I talked to Frank on the
phone a little while ago.

45:28.601 --> 45:30.568
He gave me his blessing

45:30.603 --> 45:33.938
and I gave him
my sincere thanks.

45:33.989 --> 45:35.940
We all should.

45:35.942 --> 45:37.775
- ( Applause )
- Did he talk to him?

45:46.619 --> 45:48.453
As for the road ahead...

45:51.006 --> 45:52.624
there is no road.

45:52.626 --> 45:55.210
<i>We have to dig it
out of the dirt.</i>

45:55.261 --> 45:58.429
It's no longer a thought problem.
It's not a theory.

45:58.464 --> 46:01.432
We're all going home
with blood on our sleeves.

46:01.467 --> 46:02.967
We're going to build
a working gadget.

46:03.018 --> 46:04.302
We're going to
drop it on Berlin.

46:04.304 --> 46:06.437
If those doubting Thomases

46:06.472 --> 46:08.306
in Washington
don't believe us,

46:08.308 --> 46:09.807
then they can fly out here

46:09.809 --> 46:11.249
and stick their fingers
in the wound.

46:11.277 --> 46:15.063
'Cause on July 4th, 1945,

46:15.114 --> 46:18.983
we're going to put on the biggest
firework show since the Book of Genesis.

46:19.034 --> 46:22.237
We're going to test the
gadget in our own backyard.

46:22.288 --> 46:24.455
( Crowd murmuring )

46:24.490 --> 46:25.990
A nuclear test in a year?

46:26.041 --> 46:28.459
Whose bloody sleeve
did he pull that out of?

46:28.494 --> 46:31.574
He just pushed in all his chips.
It's a bluff.

46:32.831 --> 46:35.750
Charlie:
<i>Now, I've heard it said</i>

46:35.801 --> 46:39.504
<i>that physics is
a gentleman's sport.</i>

46:40.606 --> 46:43.575
<i>Some of you may think
I'm hitting above my weight.</i>

46:43.599 --> 46:45.226
_

46:45.227 --> 46:46.895
I'm 28 years old.

46:48.063 --> 46:50.181
<i>I grew up in Missouri</i>

46:50.232 --> 46:53.518
in a cold-water tenement.

46:53.520 --> 46:55.436
Red blood, not blue.

46:55.487 --> 46:58.072
<i>My mother used to scrub it
out of my school clothes.</i>

46:59.858 --> 47:04.862
See, I had to learn
to hit above my weight.

47:06.532 --> 47:10.034
<i>We all do.</i>

47:10.085 --> 47:11.965
<i>'Cause the guys
in the other corner,</i>

47:13.004 --> 47:14.872
they invented
quantum mechanics.

47:15.424 --> 47:19.043
<i>They split the atom.
They beat us to the punch.</i>

47:19.045 --> 47:20.795
That's another error
we're going to correct.

47:20.846 --> 47:23.681
<i>And when it's over,</i>

47:23.716 --> 47:25.883
<i>when we've corrected
that error in Germany</i>

47:25.935 --> 47:27.815
right off the face
of the earth...

47:29.722 --> 47:33.224
<i>then we're all going home</i>

47:33.275 --> 47:35.893
where we belong,

47:35.895 --> 47:37.645
<i>secure in the knowledge</i>

47:38.196 --> 47:40.698
that we did the right thing.

47:40.733 --> 47:42.734
<i>( Applause, cheering )</i>

47:51.791 --> 47:53.792
<i>( line ringing )</i>

48:00.333 --> 48:02.167
Man:
<i>Polk residence.</i>

48:15.181 --> 48:18.149
I left my wallet
at the depot in Santa Fe.

48:18.184 --> 48:20.151
I swear I'll set
the land-speed record.

48:20.186 --> 48:22.487
( Chuckles )

48:22.522 --> 48:26.358
Listen, I lost my
mother this week, okay?

48:28.361 --> 48:29.995
- All right, then.
- Thank you.

48:30.029 --> 48:31.196
Go ahead.

49:07.400 --> 49:09.784
<i>( Thunder rumbles )</i>

49:43.436 --> 49:45.570
I know I broke
protocol, but--

49:45.605 --> 49:47.105
Get in.

49:56.115 --> 49:58.867
I, uh...

49:58.918 --> 50:01.586
The car.
I have a flat tire, so--

50:01.621 --> 50:04.255
You. The thespian.

50:04.290 --> 50:06.458
The role of a lifetime.

50:06.460 --> 50:08.009
Germans or Soviets?

50:09.295 --> 50:12.764
Uh, there's
some kind of mix-up.

50:12.798 --> 50:16.468
You are in a world of trouble
from sea to shining sea.

50:16.470 --> 50:18.269
I am your only friend,

50:18.304 --> 50:21.439
so I advise you to
think very carefully

50:21.474 --> 50:23.775
about your next answer.

50:23.809 --> 50:25.944
Who recruited him?

50:29.315 --> 50:30.982
What?

50:30.984 --> 50:33.318
Frank Winter recruited you.

50:33.369 --> 50:34.986
<i>Who recruited Frank Winter?</i>

50:37.490 --> 50:39.491
( gasping )

50:50.553 --> 50:53.138
<i>( thunder crashes )</i>

50:58.844 --> 51:00.895
-<i> ( music playing on radio )</i>
- ( choking )

51:10.356 --> 51:11.690
<i>( gunshot )</i>

51:11.741 --> 51:13.742
- ( shrieks )
-<i> ( music continues )</i>

51:16.362 --> 51:18.663
( breathing quickly )

51:21.834 --> 51:24.369
( panting )

51:30.760 --> 51:32.844
You all right?

51:36.382 --> 51:38.049
Get the legs.

51:43.389 --> 51:45.890
<i>( Thunder crashes )</i>

51:53.399 --> 51:55.200
Pellegrin: <i>You want a
volunteer to climb</i>

51:55.234 --> 51:57.318
-<i> a 100-foot steel lightning rod.</i>
- Charlie: Yes.

51:57.369 --> 51:59.204
Fritz: To babysit Shiva,
the God of Death,

51:59.238 --> 52:00.739
in the middle of
an electrical storm.

52:00.790 --> 52:03.908
Well, maybe the Japs
can spare a kamikaze pilot.

52:03.959 --> 52:06.544
- I'll do it.
- No way.

52:06.579 --> 52:09.581
If the colonel wants to double-check
the detonators, he can do it himself.

52:09.583 --> 52:12.217
No wife. No kids.
I'll do it.

52:12.251 --> 52:14.552
No, you're more
valuable on the ground.

52:14.587 --> 52:17.589
- Jim, you don't have to.
- It's okay.

52:18.340 --> 52:20.592
It should be
someone you trust.

52:31.270 --> 52:34.272
Man:
<i>Hey! Hey, you!</i>

52:36.275 --> 52:38.515
The Boy Wonder
said to give you this.

52:57.930 --> 53:00.799
Start the clock.

53:00.850 --> 53:03.468
Zero minus 160 minutes.

53:03.519 --> 53:06.805
By 0430 hours,

53:06.856 --> 53:08.606
every tent,
including this one,

53:08.641 --> 53:11.442
will be collapsed
and loaded for transport

53:11.477 --> 53:13.629
to the 10,000-meter
perimeter.

53:15.632 --> 53:19.268
And if anyone sees Dr. Frank
Winter on the premises,

53:19.302 --> 53:20.469
arrest him.

53:21.855 --> 53:24.306
If he resists,
you have the authority

53:24.357 --> 53:27.109
to use all necessary force.
