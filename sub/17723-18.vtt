00:17.951 --> 00:19.685
Dads <i>is recorded in front</i>
<i>of a live studio audience.</i>

00:19.687 --> 00:21.787
No.

00:21.789 --> 00:22.955
What?

00:22.957 --> 00:23.989
Tights aren't pants.

00:23.991 --> 00:25.524
This is a workplace.

00:26.626 --> 00:28.293
No, these are pants.

00:28.295 --> 00:31.463
Were they in the underwear
section or the pants section?

00:31.465 --> 00:32.664
It's a Korean clothing store.

00:32.666 --> 00:34.533
Everything's in one bin.
Oh.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.135
I'll tell you what--
bring all your clothes

00:36.137 --> 00:37.536
over to my house tonight.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.371
You can try everything on,
and I'll tell you

00:39.373 --> 00:41.040
what's underwear and what isn't.
Mmm.

00:41.042 --> 00:44.043
Perfect. Then we can go buy
clothes for you at Build-A-Bear.

00:45.378 --> 00:48.447
Freedom!

00:49.549 --> 00:51.550
<i>Braveheart. </i>
<i>George Michael.</i>

00:51.552 --> 00:53.719
I prefer George Michael,
but this time it's neither.

00:53.721 --> 00:56.288
It's freedom from my dad.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.059
Oh, my gosh, is this...?

01:00.061 --> 01:01.493
Yes, it is.
Do-do you mean...?

01:01.495 --> 01:03.395
I do.
And-and he...?

01:03.397 --> 01:05.564
Uh-huh!

01:05.566 --> 01:07.332
Will somebody just say
a complete sentence?

01:07.334 --> 01:08.333
Tights aren't pants.

01:08.335 --> 01:10.569
(groans)

01:10.571 --> 01:12.037
You look very happy right now.

01:12.039 --> 01:13.205
I am happy, Eli.
(laughs)

01:13.207 --> 01:14.373
I'm very happy. You know why?

01:14.375 --> 01:16.041
'Cause my dad's finally getting

01:16.043 --> 01:18.410
his ankle monitor bracelet
off tonight.

01:18.412 --> 01:21.847
Which means tomorrow, he gone.

01:21.849 --> 01:23.182
VERONICA:
Wait.

01:23.184 --> 01:24.516
Your dad has
an ankle monitor bracelet?

01:24.518 --> 01:25.517
Yeah, yeah.

01:25.519 --> 01:26.552
Well, a few years ago,

01:26.554 --> 01:27.920
he got tricked
into taking a job.

01:27.922 --> 01:29.388
And then...
then he took the fall

01:29.390 --> 01:31.356
for all the illegal stuff
they'd been doing.

01:31.358 --> 01:33.192
How did they trick him
into taking the job?

01:33.194 --> 01:36.862
They said, "Crawford,
would you like a job?"

01:36.864 --> 01:37.863
Yeah.

01:37.865 --> 01:38.931
So he's finally free

01:38.933 --> 01:40.566
to live wherever he wants.

01:40.568 --> 01:42.601
And Camila and I can go back
to having sex

01:42.603 --> 01:44.036
anywhere in the house.

01:44.038 --> 01:45.404
But what about
your kids?

01:45.406 --> 01:46.572
Oh, no, they're cool.

01:46.574 --> 01:48.574
They-they don't care
about that stuff.

01:48.576 --> 01:50.876
Well, wait, I mean,
where's your dad gonna go?

01:50.878 --> 01:52.544
I don't know.
You know, I figure

01:52.546 --> 01:54.379
I put one of those
umbrella hats on him

01:54.381 --> 01:56.548
and just drop him off
at a national park.

01:56.550 --> 01:57.583
Hey, you guys
should come

01:57.585 --> 01:59.251
to the ankle monitor bracelet

01:59.253 --> 02:00.385
removal ceremony tonight.

02:00.387 --> 02:01.386
ELI:
Oh!

02:01.388 --> 02:03.455
I'm in. Just being
around a leaving dad

02:03.457 --> 02:05.224
gives me hope
for the future.
Right?

02:05.226 --> 02:06.725
Uh, I can't.

02:06.727 --> 02:07.726
I have a date.

02:07.728 --> 02:08.961
Oh, yeah? Is he Asian?

02:08.963 --> 02:11.029
No.
Racist.

02:13.733 --> 02:16.935
¶ Daddy took me to the zoo

02:16.937 --> 02:18.971
¶ <i>Na, na, na, na</i> ¶

02:18.973 --> 02:22.975
¶ Just to see
something brand-new ¶

02:22.977 --> 02:25.077
¶ <i>Na, na, na</i> ¶

02:25.079 --> 02:29.248
¶ So many stars up in the sky

02:29.250 --> 02:33.752
¶ So many questions have I

02:33.754 --> 02:35.787
¶ <i>Na, na, na, na</i> ¶

02:35.789 --> 02:38.490
¶ Daddy took me for a ride.

02:41.594 --> 02:43.762
Edna, what are you doing?

02:43.764 --> 02:45.831
I clean these cobwebs off TV.

02:47.300 --> 02:49.368
That's <i>Spider-Man.</i>

02:51.437 --> 02:52.938
Hey, guys.

02:52.940 --> 02:55.607
Oh, my God, Dad,
have you moved at all today?

02:55.609 --> 02:56.675
No.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.443
But neither did Stephen Hawking.

02:58.445 --> 03:01.113
You gonna go bug him?

03:01.115 --> 03:02.481
All right, guys,
I'm heading out.

03:02.483 --> 03:03.949
Where you going?

03:03.951 --> 03:05.617
I'm going to Warner's.

03:05.619 --> 03:09.121
They are having a party
because Crawford is leaving.

03:09.123 --> 03:11.523
Can you say "leaving"?

03:11.525 --> 03:13.358
Leaving?

03:13.360 --> 03:14.693
Come on, Daddy, you can do it.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.128
Leaving.

03:16.130 --> 03:18.463
Oh, that's
a good daddy!

03:18.465 --> 03:21.466
I can't believe we're finally
getting our house back.

03:21.468 --> 03:24.469
I know. I can't believe
this is really happening.

03:24.471 --> 03:26.305
I feel like we're watching
an animal be released

03:26.307 --> 03:28.373
back into the wild.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.047
That's it?

03:35.049 --> 03:36.915
That's it.
You're free to go.

03:39.719 --> 03:42.721
Go on, boy.

03:42.723 --> 03:45.090
Go on. You can do it.

03:47.727 --> 03:49.161
(gasps)

03:49.163 --> 03:50.629
(Crawford chuckles)

03:54.834 --> 03:57.803
He probably smells my dad on me.

03:59.339 --> 04:00.939
He'll be good to go
in a day or two.

04:02.508 --> 04:04.343
So... so that's it?

04:04.345 --> 04:05.677
Done?
Yeah.

04:05.679 --> 04:07.379
Oh, uh, unless you'd
like to discuss

04:07.381 --> 04:10.916
some exciting new developments
in the federal tax law.

04:12.885 --> 04:14.219
No?

04:14.221 --> 04:15.587
Okay.

04:20.059 --> 04:22.894
Well, that's that.

04:22.896 --> 04:26.231
Now to begin
the long, arduous task

04:26.233 --> 04:28.767
of finding a new place to live.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.435
Strap yourselves in, guys.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.938
This could take weeks,
months, maybe even...

04:32.940 --> 04:34.873
Found it!

04:34.875 --> 04:36.775
What?

04:36.777 --> 04:38.210
Wow, look at that.

04:38.212 --> 04:40.078
It's a senior condo facility.

04:40.080 --> 04:43.048
With golf and-and tennis and...

04:43.050 --> 04:44.549
Aw!

04:44.551 --> 04:46.084
Look, they have
one of those cats

04:46.086 --> 04:49.554
that climbs up on your lap
when you're about to die.

04:49.556 --> 04:52.057
What, you-you think
I should live here?

04:52.059 --> 04:53.925
Yeah, it'll be great.

04:53.927 --> 04:56.928
Well, don't you think we should
look at some other places or...?

04:56.930 --> 04:59.731
Shh. Hey. Hey.

04:59.733 --> 05:02.267
Crawford, you're free.

05:02.269 --> 05:04.736
(laughs):
I'm free.

05:04.738 --> 05:07.739
We're all free.

05:07.741 --> 05:10.409
Warner! Warner,
she's hurting me!

05:10.411 --> 05:12.077
Okay, stop.

05:12.079 --> 05:14.112
Okay, Eli, get a Xanax
and a <i>People</i> magazine.

05:14.114 --> 05:15.914
Honey, stop it.
No, no, not the one

05:15.916 --> 05:17.749
with Tori Spelling on the cover.

05:17.751 --> 05:21.253
They all have
Tori Spelling on the cover!

05:21.255 --> 05:23.121
(banging pan)

05:23.123 --> 05:25.924
(groans)

05:25.926 --> 05:27.459
Edna!

05:27.461 --> 05:29.928
Could you please be quiet?

05:29.930 --> 05:32.097
I really need to rest.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.999
Okay, I be quiet!

05:34.001 --> 05:37.069
(music sung in Spanish playing)

05:38.604 --> 05:40.939
Edna, please!

05:40.941 --> 05:42.441
What? That no Edna.

05:42.443 --> 05:45.177
That radio!

05:47.447 --> 05:49.348
I'm gonna go up to my room.

05:49.350 --> 05:51.783
I'm too weak to give a specific.

05:51.785 --> 05:55.754
But consider Mexican music
insulted generally!

05:57.790 --> 05:59.858
(turns up volume)

06:14.874 --> 06:16.675
This is best part!

06:16.677 --> 06:19.311
(whoops)

06:19.313 --> 06:21.713
<i>Arriba!  Arriba!  Arriba!</i>

06:26.052 --> 06:27.886
Dad! Dad!

06:27.888 --> 06:30.055
Edna, what happened?

06:30.057 --> 06:31.990
He died.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.558
What?

06:33.560 --> 06:35.060
Oh, so sorry.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.895
<i>¿Cómo se dice?</i>

06:36.897 --> 06:39.297
He almost died.

06:41.501 --> 06:43.001
Oh, my God! Doc! Doc!

06:43.003 --> 06:44.836
Is he gonna be all right?
Wow.

06:44.838 --> 06:47.239
You sounded
like Marty McFly just then.

06:47.241 --> 06:49.574
Now, uh,

06:49.576 --> 06:52.344
your dad has had
what we doctors call

06:52.346 --> 06:54.212
an adult-sized bangeroo

06:54.214 --> 06:56.515
of a heart attack.

06:56.517 --> 06:58.250
A heart attack?

06:58.252 --> 07:00.552
Oh, my God.
Dad, please wake up.

07:00.554 --> 07:01.853
I'm so sorry we
were fighting.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.021
We-we were
arguing earlier.

07:03.023 --> 07:05.056
Do you think that had
anything to do with it?

07:05.058 --> 07:06.057
Well, yeah.

07:06.059 --> 07:07.459
Duh.

07:10.730 --> 07:13.732
Boy, I really can't believe
what happened to David, hmm?

07:13.734 --> 07:15.100
You mean the heart attack?

07:15.102 --> 07:16.234
No.

07:16.236 --> 07:18.737
How fat he got.

07:18.739 --> 07:21.406
Yeah, you could really see it
in that hospital gown.

07:21.408 --> 07:22.874
It is such a shame.

07:22.876 --> 07:24.910
Yeah.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.211
Well, it looks like
you're almost packed.

07:26.213 --> 07:27.712
Are-are you
excited to finally

07:27.714 --> 07:30.081
get your own place and be
the captain of your own ship?

07:30.083 --> 07:32.050
I guess.

07:32.052 --> 07:34.419
(laughing):
Oh, come on.

07:34.421 --> 07:36.621
Oh, come on, this is
gonna be good for you.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.056
Look what happened
to David.

07:38.058 --> 07:39.558
You know,
he's cooped up with Eli,

07:39.560 --> 07:40.725
and it-it's not healthy.

07:40.727 --> 07:42.461
Don't you want
to make new friends?

07:43.596 --> 07:45.630
You're my friend.

07:47.900 --> 07:50.435
I... of cour...
of course I'm your friend.

07:50.437 --> 07:52.571
Yeah.
But I'm also your son.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.639
And-and, you know,
and that's...

07:54.641 --> 07:56.074
makes that impossible.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.776
Oh, come...

07:57.778 --> 07:59.478
You're gonna love this place.

07:59.480 --> 08:01.279
That's funny.

08:01.281 --> 08:04.416
I said exactly
the same thing to you

08:04.418 --> 08:06.651
right before I accidentally
shipped you off

08:06.653 --> 08:08.320
to that special-needs camp.

08:08.322 --> 08:09.788
Oh.

08:09.790 --> 08:12.123
Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah.

08:12.125 --> 08:13.925
Yeah, I remember.
Boy, you brought back

08:13.927 --> 08:15.494
so many trophies.
Yeah.

08:19.098 --> 08:21.099
Come on, Dad.

08:21.101 --> 08:22.100
Come back.

08:22.102 --> 08:23.668
(door opens)

08:24.937 --> 08:27.005
How's he doing?

08:28.941 --> 08:30.141
What?

08:30.143 --> 08:31.943
Shouldn't you be telling me?

08:31.945 --> 08:33.445
Okay, fine.

08:33.447 --> 08:37.349
I guess I will just do
everything around here.

08:37.351 --> 08:39.618
Where did you go
to medical school?

08:39.620 --> 08:42.621
Um, a little school
called Putnam Valley.

08:42.623 --> 08:44.956
Heard of it?

08:44.958 --> 08:47.626
No.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.728
Everyone says that.

08:51.797 --> 08:54.299
You've got a really
terrible bedside manner.

08:54.301 --> 08:58.203
And you are a tiny dad killer.

09:02.808 --> 09:04.809
(door closes)

09:04.811 --> 09:07.045
Oh, my God, Edna, what
if he doesn't make it?

09:07.047 --> 09:08.880
The last
conversation we had

09:08.882 --> 09:10.482
was him asking
me for help

09:10.484 --> 09:12.484
and me yelling at him.

09:12.486 --> 09:14.619
What the hell is wrong with me?

09:16.656 --> 09:19.524
I should've been a better son.

09:19.526 --> 09:22.394
I mean, I know he wasn't
always the greatest dad.

09:22.396 --> 09:24.696
And yes, he is
a completely

09:24.698 --> 09:28.199
self-obsessed
egomaniacal baby.

09:28.201 --> 09:30.001
That's why he's lived 65 years

09:30.003 --> 09:31.303
and doesn't have
a single friend.

09:34.340 --> 09:37.242
But this heart attack
was my fault.

09:37.244 --> 09:40.946
He extended his heart to me,
and I literally broke it.

09:43.015 --> 09:46.251
I just want to tell him
how sorry I am.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.253
Tell him that...

09:48.255 --> 09:50.221
I love him.

09:50.223 --> 09:51.556
Even if it means I get

09:51.558 --> 09:53.358
one of his disgusting
kisses on the lips

09:53.360 --> 09:55.493
followed by the coffee
and anchovy cross breeze.

09:57.930 --> 10:01.199
It's whitefish,
and I love you, too.

10:01.201 --> 10:03.268
Dad! Oh, my God,
you're awake!

10:03.270 --> 10:04.903
Edna, he's awake!

10:04.905 --> 10:06.271
Edna!

10:08.207 --> 10:10.942
Oh. Hey.

10:15.581 --> 10:19.551
Finally some peace and
quiet without your dad.

10:19.553 --> 10:22.387
Do you know how refreshing it is
to open the refrigerator

10:22.389 --> 10:25.557
and not have bite marks
in the cheese?

10:25.559 --> 10:27.559
(laughs)

10:27.561 --> 10:31.563
I know, it's so great having
the place to ourselves, right?

10:31.565 --> 10:32.564
Yeah.

10:32.566 --> 10:34.065
Did you talk to him today?

10:34.067 --> 10:35.634
Are you kidding me? No.

10:35.636 --> 10:37.602
I did... No, of course not, no.

10:37.604 --> 10:39.070
You know, I mean, I, you know,

10:39.072 --> 10:42.273
I tried to call him
a few times, and...

10:42.275 --> 10:45.010
sent him a few e-mails
or whatever.

10:46.412 --> 10:49.080
A few texts.

10:49.082 --> 10:50.749
But other than that,
no, I didn't...

10:50.751 --> 10:52.651
I didn't think about him at all.

10:54.086 --> 10:55.553
So, what do you want
to do tonight?

10:56.589 --> 10:59.057
I'm actually
feeling kind of gassy.

11:00.459 --> 11:02.527
I think I just gonna
go upstairs and try.

11:03.829 --> 11:05.296
Wish me luck.

11:05.298 --> 11:06.965
Okay. Yeah, good luck.

11:06.967 --> 11:08.933
Oh, hey, be careful, you know.

11:08.935 --> 11:12.804
Last time, you... you popped
a blood vessel in your eye.

11:12.806 --> 11:15.707
Don't tell me how to poop!

11:19.278 --> 11:21.946
David, it's so wonderful
that you're awake.

11:21.948 --> 11:24.349
Don't say "wonderful"
to another guy.

11:25.851 --> 11:27.352
Hey, hey, David!

11:27.354 --> 11:28.520
Crawford?

11:28.522 --> 11:29.988
Oh.

11:29.990 --> 11:31.456
There.

11:31.458 --> 11:32.957
What is that for?

11:32.959 --> 11:35.727
I bet him 20 bucks I'd have
a heart attack before he did.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.130
Hi.
Hey.

11:39.132 --> 11:40.365
Remember me?

11:40.367 --> 11:42.834
Yeah, I left you a few messages.

11:42.836 --> 11:43.968
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.

11:43.970 --> 11:45.637
You know, from the time I get up

11:45.639 --> 11:48.973
at 11:00 a.m. until 5:30
when we all go to bed,

11:48.975 --> 11:53.044
it is just activity,
activity, activity, activity.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.145
You know?

11:54.147 --> 11:56.381
I see you got
a-a cool headband tan.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.650
Yeah, I thought I'd, uh,
get back into playing tennis,

11:58.652 --> 12:00.185
and I'd start with the headband.

12:00.187 --> 12:01.720
Ah!

12:01.722 --> 12:03.354
Okay.

12:03.356 --> 12:04.856
Here you go, Crawf.
Oh, hey, T.

12:04.858 --> 12:05.890
Hey.
Ah, thank you.

12:05.892 --> 12:07.392
Uh, gang, this is Todd.

12:07.394 --> 12:08.560
Hey, guys.

12:08.562 --> 12:09.561
Hi.

12:09.563 --> 12:10.895
You-you work, uh...

12:10.897 --> 12:12.330
you work at the condo?

12:12.332 --> 12:14.532
Yeah, Todd has been
like a son to me.

12:14.534 --> 12:16.167
In fact, Warner,

12:16.169 --> 12:18.369
I want to thank you
for kicking me out.

12:18.371 --> 12:21.539
I've really gotten
to love this new community

12:21.541 --> 12:24.008
and-and my new friend Todd.

12:24.010 --> 12:26.377
I think I can finally
make a life there.

12:26.379 --> 12:29.581
Well, I-I'm glad
we're all happy.

12:29.583 --> 12:30.582
You bet.

12:30.584 --> 12:31.716
Yeah.

12:31.718 --> 12:33.017
Crawford, we should go.
Oh!

12:33.019 --> 12:34.853
Yeah, right,
we left our golf cart

12:34.855 --> 12:36.988
in the ambulance space.

12:38.357 --> 12:39.891
Oh, my God, David, you're okay!

12:39.893 --> 12:41.926
I'm so sorry. I got here
as soon as I could.

12:41.928 --> 12:44.028
As soon as you could?
He's been here three days.

12:44.030 --> 12:45.230
(Veronica sighs)

12:45.232 --> 12:47.398
Sorry. I was away
for the weekend in Big Sur.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.400
What were you doing there?
My dad almost died.

12:49.402 --> 12:51.436
Well, actually...

12:51.438 --> 12:53.071
I got engaged.

12:53.073 --> 12:54.105
(quiet laugh)

12:54.107 --> 12:56.174
(squealing):
Oh, my...

13:06.719 --> 13:09.554
Engaged?
But what about us?

13:09.556 --> 13:10.889
Us?

13:10.891 --> 13:12.257
There's no us.

13:12.259 --> 13:13.725
Hey...
(stammers)

13:13.727 --> 13:14.893
I'm gonna... I'm gonna...

13:14.895 --> 13:15.894
(whistles)

13:15.896 --> 13:18.263
Yeah, okay.

13:18.265 --> 13:20.632
(door opens and closes)

13:21.967 --> 13:23.902
Pretend I'm not here.

13:23.904 --> 13:26.137
Engaged?
(chuckles)

13:26.139 --> 13:27.272
I didn't...

13:27.274 --> 13:28.740
How-how long
have you had a boyfriend?

13:28.742 --> 13:29.908
Six months.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.910
Six months? Wow.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.278
Why didn't you tell me?

13:33.280 --> 13:34.979
Why would I?

13:34.981 --> 13:37.148
Ooh.

13:38.951 --> 13:40.418
Be-Because...

13:40.420 --> 13:42.921
well, well,
because we're friends, right?

13:42.923 --> 13:45.757
Um, so, what's his name?

13:45.759 --> 13:47.625
Uh, his name is Colt.

13:47.627 --> 13:49.794
Is he a horse?

13:49.796 --> 13:52.330
In a way.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.433
Look, I know we haven't been

13:55.435 --> 13:58.803
seeing each other long,
but when you know, you know.

13:58.805 --> 14:00.104
(both laugh)

14:00.106 --> 14:02.173
That's great. That's great.

14:04.143 --> 14:06.611
Do you have a problem with this?
No.

14:06.613 --> 14:07.779
I'm just surprised.

14:07.781 --> 14:09.113
I'm just so surprised.
That's all.

14:09.115 --> 14:10.448
Of course,
I'm-I'm happy for you.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.116
Thanks.
Congratulations.

14:12.118 --> 14:13.117
Thank you.
(both laugh)

14:13.119 --> 14:15.620
DAVID:
Just a hug?

14:15.622 --> 14:16.754
What a wuss.

14:19.291 --> 14:21.793
(droning beep, man groaning)

14:21.795 --> 14:24.229
Wrong guy.

14:27.499 --> 14:30.034
So, Veronica
and Colt, huh?

14:30.036 --> 14:31.302
(groans) Colt.

14:31.304 --> 14:33.371
What a terrible name!

14:34.807 --> 14:37.108
So, your dad and Todd, huh?

14:39.712 --> 14:41.779
Todd!

14:45.150 --> 14:47.151
You know, I-I Googled his name,

14:47.153 --> 14:49.888
and all this creepy stuff
came up.

14:49.890 --> 14:52.390
Probably 'cause I didn't have
his last name, but...

14:53.492 --> 14:54.692
Hey, guys.

14:54.694 --> 14:56.194
Uh, this is my boyfriend.

14:56.196 --> 14:57.996
Uh, my fiancé.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.397
Weird!
Weird!

14:59.399 --> 15:01.733
Uh, my fiancé Colt.

15:01.735 --> 15:03.234
Uh, Colt, this is
Warner and Eli.

15:03.236 --> 15:04.335
Hey.
Hey.

15:04.337 --> 15:05.670
Wow.

15:05.672 --> 15:08.172
Uh, I cannot believe
I'm meeting Eli Sachs.

15:08.174 --> 15:09.707
My head is just like...

15:09.709 --> 15:11.042
(imitates an explosion)

15:11.044 --> 15:13.544
Uh, it's such an honor.

15:13.546 --> 15:14.545
What? Really?

15:14.547 --> 15:16.014
You're a legend.

15:16.016 --> 15:18.750
I read about you
in <i>Gamer Weekly</i> back in '08.

15:18.752 --> 15:21.419
Oh, yeah?
You came across
so smart and funny.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.187
(laughs)
Well, thanks.

15:23.189 --> 15:25.857
That joke you made about, uh,
h-having a business partner

15:25.859 --> 15:28.026
is like swimming the
English Channel with a dead guy

15:28.028 --> 15:29.060
strapped to you neck?

15:29.062 --> 15:30.695
(all three laughing)

15:30.697 --> 15:32.597
Dude, that was epic.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.365
Dead guy, yeah...

15:34.367 --> 15:36.234
Wait, what?

15:36.236 --> 15:38.202
I can't tell you--

15:38.204 --> 15:41.606
I'm so jealous Veronica
gets to work here with you.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.741
Yeah, she's very lucky.

15:43.743 --> 15:45.243
Oh, hey, um,

15:45.245 --> 15:47.445
I heard you're a fan
of vintage pinball machines?

15:47.447 --> 15:48.546
A big fan.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.381
You should come over.
I got a vintage

15:50.383 --> 15:52.784
Elton John <i>Captain Fantastic</i>
<i>machine in the garage.</i>

15:52.786 --> 15:54.552
Whoa!
Yeah, it is so old,

15:54.554 --> 15:56.220
he's actually
ogling women in it.

15:56.222 --> 15:58.423
(laughs)
Wow, that's so cool.

15:58.425 --> 15:59.757
Thanks.
Uh, you...

15:59.759 --> 16:01.392
Colt and I should
really get going.

16:01.394 --> 16:03.528
Oh, I just got here!
Oh, he just got here!

16:04.630 --> 16:06.898
I know, but we have
so much wedding stuff to do.

16:06.900 --> 16:08.433
We have to find
a venue, register.

16:08.435 --> 16:10.568
Register?
What is he-- a sex offender?

16:10.570 --> 16:12.470
(both laugh)
Nice one!

16:12.472 --> 16:13.738
(laughs)

16:13.740 --> 16:14.906
All right, come on.
Let's go.

16:14.908 --> 16:15.907
All right, well, we'll talk!

16:15.909 --> 16:16.975
Yeah, yeah, no, okay.

16:16.977 --> 16:17.976
And ball out!

16:17.978 --> 16:19.143
Right on, man, we'll play...

16:19.145 --> 16:20.745
we'll play some pinball!
All right.

16:20.747 --> 16:21.980
(laughs)

16:21.982 --> 16:24.849
I hate him.

16:25.617 --> 16:27.986
(rain pattering)

16:27.988 --> 16:30.488
(thunder rumbling)

16:30.490 --> 16:31.489
Hey.

16:31.491 --> 16:32.490
Hey, hey, hey.

16:32.492 --> 16:33.658
Are you all right, sweetie?

16:33.660 --> 16:35.593
Yeah. Why?

16:35.595 --> 16:37.762
You cried during sex
at a different time

16:37.764 --> 16:39.497
than you usually do.

16:42.434 --> 16:45.370
I was just... I was just
thinking about my dad.

16:48.107 --> 16:50.808
Okay, um, that's
disturbing.

16:50.810 --> 16:52.443
No.

16:52.445 --> 16:53.945
No, I was just...
I was just

16:53.947 --> 16:56.481
thinking about him
not being here.

16:56.483 --> 16:58.116
But...

16:58.118 --> 16:59.283
I thought that's
what we wanted, right?

16:59.285 --> 17:00.284
Yeah.

17:00.286 --> 17:01.619
Uh, of course,
but, you know,

17:01.621 --> 17:03.354
now that he's gone,
I'm just... I just...

17:03.356 --> 17:06.491
I'm just... I started
to realize that, uh...

17:06.493 --> 17:08.793
What?

17:08.795 --> 17:10.962
You know, I just... I just...

17:10.964 --> 17:13.664
miss having him around,
I guess, uh...

17:13.666 --> 17:16.534
I mean, you know,
I know... I know he can be

17:16.536 --> 17:18.302
a pain in the bum, and...

17:18.304 --> 17:20.438
pardon my language,
but-but, uh...

17:23.208 --> 17:25.543
But, you know,
I-I love my dad, you know?

17:25.545 --> 17:27.478
And I-I just...
I just don't want him

17:27.480 --> 17:30.114
living in a...
in a retirement condo.

17:31.817 --> 17:34.952
With Todd.

17:36.822 --> 17:38.823
So...?

17:38.825 --> 17:40.758
What are you saying?

17:42.895 --> 17:44.395
Uh... (stammers)

17:44.397 --> 17:46.464
I want... I want my dad back.

17:49.334 --> 17:51.669
Well, if you really
want him back,

17:51.671 --> 17:54.872
then I guess we'll
make it work.

17:54.874 --> 17:57.575
Really?

17:57.577 --> 17:59.377
Yes, really.

17:59.379 --> 18:02.180
Babe, if it makes you happy,
then, of course, I'm on board

18:02.182 --> 18:03.347
100%.
It makes me happy.

18:03.349 --> 18:05.550
I love you.
I love you.

18:05.552 --> 18:07.018
Now, go, go!

18:07.020 --> 18:08.886
Okay, okay.

18:08.888 --> 18:11.155
You're-you're gonna want
something for this, aren't you?

18:12.758 --> 18:14.192
Yes.

18:14.194 --> 18:17.428
A Kobe-Bryant-forget-about-
those-rape-charges diamond.

18:24.369 --> 18:26.037
Hey, Dad, how you feeling?

18:26.039 --> 18:28.739
Jewish.

18:28.741 --> 18:29.907
What are you doing there?

18:29.909 --> 18:32.076
I'm writing
an alphabetical list

18:32.078 --> 18:36.714
of all the people I should
apologize to before I die.

18:36.716 --> 18:38.216
Did you put the cast

18:38.218 --> 18:40.885
of <i>Menopause The</i>
<i>Musical</i> on there?

18:40.887 --> 18:43.621
Kidding? They owe me an apology.

18:43.623 --> 18:44.889
(laughs)

18:44.891 --> 18:47.391
Well, I'm glad you're
feeling better.

18:47.393 --> 18:49.460
Eli?

18:51.730 --> 18:54.265
Listen to me.

18:54.267 --> 18:56.901
I realized why I get

18:56.903 --> 18:59.070
angry at everybody.

18:59.072 --> 19:02.640
It's because I lived
a life of regret.

19:02.642 --> 19:06.577
I don't want you to make
the same mistake as me.

19:06.579 --> 19:09.147
I haven't.

19:09.149 --> 19:10.581
You sure?

19:10.583 --> 19:12.316
Why don't you tell her?

19:12.318 --> 19:13.751
Tell who?

19:13.753 --> 19:15.653
You know, Veronica.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.088
Veronica?

19:17.090 --> 19:18.422
Yeah.

19:18.424 --> 19:21.592
The Oriental.

19:21.594 --> 19:23.761
You want to... you're
gonna want to go ahead

19:23.763 --> 19:26.330
and put her name down
on that list, too.

19:27.766 --> 19:30.601
She's engaged, Dad.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.770
What am I supposed to do?

19:32.772 --> 19:35.439
If I knew that...

19:35.441 --> 19:37.942
(chokes up)

19:37.944 --> 19:40.545
I wouldn't need this list.

19:41.947 --> 19:44.115
You'll figure it out.

19:44.117 --> 19:46.117
You're smart.

19:46.119 --> 19:49.887
You're smarter

19:52.024 --> 19:54.292
Thanks, Dad.

19:54.294 --> 19:56.360
Mm-wah!

19:58.197 --> 20:01.032
Now, go.

20:01.034 --> 20:03.301
You go get her, Mr. Eli!

20:03.303 --> 20:05.536
Yeah? You sure she's the one?

20:05.538 --> 20:07.138
She Chinese with boobs.

20:07.140 --> 20:09.540
Yeah, she the one!

20:13.679 --> 20:15.746

20:34.033 --> 20:36.100
Dad!

20:38.070 --> 20:39.704
Warner?!

20:39.706 --> 20:41.706
What the hell
are you doing here?

20:41.708 --> 20:43.841
I came to bring you home, Dad.

20:43.843 --> 20:46.077
Warner, this is my home now.

20:46.079 --> 20:49.380
Dad, I'm-I'm not gonna
let you cripple me

20:49.382 --> 20:51.015
emotionally and financially,

20:51.017 --> 20:53.351
and then just walk away.

20:53.353 --> 20:54.352
Excuse me, visiting hours...

20:54.354 --> 20:56.887
Oh, stuff it, Todd!

20:56.889 --> 20:59.090
Come on, Dad,
let's go home.

20:59.092 --> 21:00.091
(chuckles)

21:00.093 --> 21:01.425
That's my son.

21:01.427 --> 21:02.593
All right!

21:02.595 --> 21:03.728
WARNER:
Thank you.

21:03.730 --> 21:05.896
MAN:
Way to go, Crawford!

21:05.898 --> 21:08.266
Way to go!

21:08.268 --> 21:10.334
Oh, no.

21:18.043 --> 21:21.145
