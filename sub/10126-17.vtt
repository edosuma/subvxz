00:24.567 --> 00:25.767
YEAH, IT DID.

00:25.767 --> 00:27.100
THEN TELL ME.

00:27.100 --> 00:29.967
I CAN'T, OK?
YOU JUST GOT TO TALK
TO TOPANGA.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000

THAT SHE CAN'T MOVE

00:55.100 --> 00:57.667
WILL YOU JUST GIVE ME
A HUG AND A KISS AND SAY
GOOD-BYE TO ME?

NO.

CAME TO AMERICA,

01:20.000 --> 01:22.567
WE REALLY HAVEN'T BEEN ON
VERY MANY DATES, YOU KNOW.

01:22.567 --> 01:23.867
ISN'T THAT SO, ROSIE?

01:23.867 --> 01:25.033
YES, AND I

THEY HAVE A LITTLE

CAN SIT ON A COUCH,

01:40.500 --> 01:44.300
BUT YOU WERE CLEVER ENOUGH
TO CHOOSE THE COZY CHAIR.

01:47.200 --> 01:49.400
CLEVER INDEED.

01:49.400 --> 01:53.367
ARE YOU JUST AS CLEVER?

01:57.100 --> 01:58.300
HELLO, TOPANGA, HI!

01:59.300 --> 02:02.600

THE PHONE RING, BECKY?

FOR SOMEBODY TO BE
ON IT.

A girl named Topanga.

03:56.800 --> 03:58.400
Come here.

04:00.066 --> 04:05.600
YOU SEE, WE FIRST MET
WHEN WE WERE 8 MONTHS OLD
IN A SANDBOX.

04:05.600 --> 04:07.400
SHE WAS YOUR
FIRST GIRLFRIEND, THEN.

04:07.400 --> 04:09.367
I'M PRETTY SURE.

04:09.367 --> 04:11.400
AND I ALWAYS THOUGHT
WE WERE MEANT TO BE
TOGETHER

04:11.400 --> 04:12.700
FOR THE REST
OF OUR LIVES,

SHE MOVED TO PITTSBURGH,

04:15.734 --> 04:20.100
AND I NEVER GOT A CHANCE
TO SAY GOOD-BYE

04:20.100 --> 04:21.700
AND THAT I LOVE HER.

WHAT IF I NEVER GET
A CHANCE TO TELL HER?

04:25.567 --> 04:26.800
WILL SHE KNOW?

THAT IS
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
AND HEARTFELT THING

IF I CRIED MY EYES OUT
JUST RIGHT NOW?

WITH FRANCESCA.

THERE WAS LOT
OF HEARTACHE,

TIME STEPPED IN

05:43.667 --> 05:45.834
AND I GOT OVER
MY DEVASTATING LOSS.

05:45.834 --> 05:47.467
WHO'S FRANCESCA?

05:47.467 --> 05:49.700

DRIVE DOWN TO PITTSBURGH

SOME SUPPLIERS,

06:01.000 --> 06:03.600
AND YOU CAN
SPEND SOME TIME
WITH TOPANGA.

06:03.600 --> 06:05.500
I DON'T THINK THAT'S
THE BEST IDEA, ALAN.

06:05.500 --> 06:06.967
MOM, YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:06.967 --> 06:08.367
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL, OK?

06:08.367 --> 06:11.600
YOU'VE MADE IT
REAL CLEAR HOW YOU FEEL.

06:11.600 --> 06:13.600
MY FEELINGS ARE FOR YOU.

06:13.600 --> 06:15.800
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO BE IN PAIN.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.400
NO. YOU JUST DON'T WANT
ME AND TOPANGA TO BE
TOGETHER.

06:18.400 --> 06:22.100
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO BE SICK OVER TOPANGA.

06:22.100 --> 06:23.200

ANYMORE.

06:23.200 --> 06:24.600
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

06:24.600 --> 06:27.033
I THINK THIS
PRESENTS YOU WITH
A GOOD OPPORTUNITY

06:27.033 --> 06:28.600
TO GET TO KNOW
OTHER GIRLS.

06:28.600 --> 06:31.867
MOM, I DON'T WANT
TO KNOW OTHER GIRLS, OK?

06:31.867 --> 06:34.133
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S HEALTHY.

06:34.133 --> 06:35.767
TOPANGA AND I WOULD'VE
BEEN TOGETHER

06:35.767 --> 06:36.900
FOR THE REST
OF OUR LIVES.

06:36.900 --> 06:39.100
NO, YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN.

06:39.100 --> 06:41.367
YOU BOTH HAVE TO GET
TO KNOW OTHER PEOPLE

06:41.367 --> 06:43.200
TO MAKE A CHOICE
LIKE THAT.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.400
I HAD RELATIONSHIPS
WITH 4 OTHER MEN

06:45.400 --> 06:47.300
BEFORE I MET YOUR FATHER.

06:47.300 --> 06:48.667
MA!

06:48.667 --> 06:49.900
I KNOW 3.

06:51.900 --> 06:53.100
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT, MOM,

06:53.100 --> 06:54.500
I'M SURE YOU'LL BE
REAL HAPPY TO KNOW

06:54.500 --> 06:56.667
THAT I'M NOT GOING
TO GO TO PITTSBURGH, OK?

06:56.667 --> 06:59.000
WHY NOT?
YOU AND TOPANGA
HAVE A FIGHT?

06:59.000 --> 07:01.500
NO. NO FIGHT.
I JUST REALIZED
THAT I'M THE ONE

07:01.500 --> 07:02.934
MAKING ALL
THE PHONE CALLS.

07:02.934 --> 07:04.100
I'M THE ONE WRITING
ALL THE LETTERS,

07:04.100 --> 07:05.800
BUT I WILL NOT
BE THE ONE WHO
TRAVELS 300 MILES

07:05.800 --> 07:07.200
TO BE REJECTED
AND LOOK LIKE
A FOOL.

07:07.200 --> 07:10.000
SO IF LIFE DOESN'T
WANT ME AND TOPANGA
TOGETHER,

07:10.000 --> 07:11.300
THEN YOU CAN'T
FIGHT LIFE, CAN YOU?

07:13.233 --> 07:15.100
CORY.

07:15.100 --> 07:16.834
TOPANGA!

07:23.400 --> 07:25.033
AREN'T YOU GOING
TO HUG ME?

07:25.033 --> 07:28.100
WELL, YOU KNOW,
WET AND EVERYTHING.

07:32.567 --> 07:34.934

I MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

07:37.667 --> 07:39.100
HI, HONEY.

07:39.100 --> 07:41.834
DO YOUR PARENTS
WANT TO COME IN?

07:41.834 --> 07:45.000
ACTUALLY THERE
ARE NO PARENTS.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.300
SO YOUR PARENTS
DROPPED YOU OFF?

07:47.300 --> 07:48.600
I'M BETTING NO.

07:48.600 --> 07:51.000
I COULDN'T BE
WITHOUT YOU.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.700
I WASN'T DOING
TOO GOOD EITHER.

07:52.700 --> 07:56.600
TOPANGA, YOUR PARENTS
DON'T KNOW YOU'RE HERE,
DO THEY?

07:56.600 --> 08:00.100
NO.
NO, THEY DON'T.

08:01.500 --> 08:04.567
TOPANGA,
YOUR PARENTS ARE GOING TO BE
VERY WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

08:04.567 --> 08:06.767
WHY WOULD THEY
BE WORRIED ABOUT ME NOW?

08:06.767 --> 08:09.033
THEY WEREN'T WORRIED
ABOUT ME WHEN THEY
DECIDED TO MOVE.

08:09.033 --> 08:10.700
I TOLD THEM HOW MUCH
CORY MEANT TO ME

08:10.700 --> 08:12.300
AND HOW I COULDN'T
BE AWAY FROM HIM.

08:12.300 --> 08:14.500
THEY SAID I WAS
TOO YOUNG TO SAY THINGS
LIKE THAT,

08:14.500 --> 08:15.867
THAT I DIDN'T KNOW.

08:15.867 --> 08:17.600
SO YOU RAN AWAY FROM THEM?

08:17.600 --> 08:19.900
I RAN AWAY TO CORY.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.900
OK. IT JUST GOT SERIOUS NOW.

08:22.900 --> 08:25.100
TOPANGA, I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO CALL THEM.

08:25.100 --> 08:27.700
NO, MOM. DIDN'T YOU HEAR
WHAT SHE JUST SAID?

08:27.700 --> 08:29.400
HER PARENTS DON'T
UNDERSTAND HER, OK?

08:29.400 --> 08:31.467
JUST LIKE YOU TWO
DON'T UNDERSTAND ME.

08:31.467 --> 08:34.400
WE WANT TO BE TOGETHER.
THAT'S WHAT WE WANT.

08:34.400 --> 08:36.667
TOPANGA, I KNOW
YOU MISS CORY,

08:36.667 --> 08:39.000
BUT TO COME HERE
WITHOUT YOUR PARENTS'
PERMISSION,

08:39.000 --> 08:40.133
THAT'S JUST WRONG.

08:40.133 --> 08:41.400
HOW CAN IT BE WRONG

08:41.400 --> 08:43.467
IF SHE LOVES ME
ENOUGH TO DO THAT?

08:43.467 --> 08:45.967
I MEAN, I'M SORRY
I DIDN'T DO IT MYSELF.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.200
HELP ME, ALAN.

08:49.200 --> 08:51.000
FIRST OF ALL,

08:51.000 --> 08:55.467
WE ARE NOT THE ENEMY.

08:55.467 --> 08:57.800
WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU TWO
WANT TO BE TOGETHER,

08:57.800 --> 09:00.967
BUT THIS IS NOT THE WAY
TO GO ABOUT IT.

09:00.967 --> 09:02.834
I'M CALLING.

09:05.867 --> 09:08.867
I PROMISE NO ONE
IS GOING TO TAKE YOU
AWAY FROM ME. I PROMISE.

09:14.133 --> 09:16.000
WE HAVE TO.

09:21.033 --> 09:22.900
SO THE FIRST DAY
WE DIDN'T CONNECT
WAS MONDAY,

09:22.900 --> 09:24.400
BUT I FIGURED
YOU WERE BUSY
WITH SCHOOL

09:24.400 --> 09:25.834
AND YOU HAD A LOT
OF OTHER STUFF
TO DO,

09:25.834 --> 09:28.233
BUT THEN WE MISSED
TUESDAY AND
WEDNESDAY,

09:28.233 --> 09:30.900
AND I STARTED
WONDERING WHO
WERE YOU WITH?

09:30.900 --> 09:33.967
I COULD'VE SAT
AND TALKED TO YOU
ON THE PHONE EVERY DAY,

09:33.967 --> 09:35.033
BUT IT WAS JUST THE PHONE,

09:35.033 --> 09:37.834
AND EVERY TIME I HUNG UP
IT GOT HARDER FOR ME.

09:37.834 --> 09:39.400
I JUST TRIED
TO STAY BUSY.

09:39.400 --> 09:41.000
WELL, DOES BUSY INCLUDE

09:41.000 --> 09:43.500
GOING TO
THE SCHOOL DANCE
WITH YOUR NEW FRIENDS?

09:43.500 --> 09:44.834
HOW'D YOU KNOW?

09:46.500 --> 09:48.233
IT WAS A GUESS.

09:48.233 --> 09:50.000
IT WAS JUST
SOMETHING TO DO.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.967
AND I HAD A LOUSY TIME
BECAUSE ALL I THOUGHT
ABOUT WAS YOU.

09:54.867 --> 09:56.600
YOU MISSED
A PHONE CALL OR TWO.
WHAT WERE YOU UP TO?

09:56.600 --> 09:58.033
LISTEN, IF I MISSED
A PHONE CALL,

09:58.033 --> 10:01.400
IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS
OUT AT THE MAILBOX
CHECKING FOR A LETTER.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.467
HEY, CORY!
THE SPARROW SISTERS CALLED.

10:03.467 --> 10:06.200
THEY WANT TO SEE US AGAIN.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.000
HI, TOPANGA.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.667
NATURALLY, I TOLD THEM
YOU WERE MARRIED.

10:11.900 --> 10:13.734
SO THE SPARROW SISTERS.

10:13.734 --> 10:14.767
THEY WERE IN YOUR MAILBOX,
WERE THEY?

10:14.767 --> 10:17.600
TRUST ME.
I LOVE YOU.

10:17.600 --> 10:19.900
I KNOW YOU DO.
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

10:22.033 --> 10:24.834
OK, YOUR HAIR'S WET,
YOU'RE WEARING CORY'S
CLOTHES.

10:24.834 --> 10:26.000
YOU RAN WAY,
DIDN'T YOU?

10:27.300 --> 10:30.867
SHE GETS THAT FROM ME.

10:30.867 --> 10:32.300
HEY, SHE RAN AWAY!

10:34.600 --> 10:35.800
BAD, BAD, BAD GIRL!

10:38.967 --> 10:41.600
WE CALLED YOUR FOLKS,
TOPANGA, TO LET THEM
KNOW THAT YOU'RE HERE

10:41.600 --> 10:43.767
AND THAT YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.
AND LATER ON--

10:43.767 --> 10:45.300
AND LATER ON, WHAT,
MOM?

10:45.300 --> 10:47.300
SHE'S GOING BACK
TO HER HOUSE?
THEN, FINE.

10:47.300 --> 10:49.400
I'M GOING WITH HER.
WE CAN DO THIS
AGAIN THERE.

10:49.400 --> 10:53.000
CORY, YOU LIVE HERE.
TOPANGA LIVES
IN PITTSBURGH.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.100
I DIDN'T DO IT.
STOP JUMPING ON ME.

10:56.100 --> 10:57.400
NO, NO, MOM.
I'M NOT JUMPING ON YOU

10:57.400 --> 10:58.934
BECAUSE OF WHERE
WE LIVE.

10:58.934 --> 11:00.667
I'M JUMPING ON YOU
BECAUSE YOU SEEM HAPPY
ABOUT THIS.

11:00.667 --> 11:03.367
WHY DON'T YOU WANT US
TO BE TOGETHER?

11:03.367 --> 11:05.800
I HEAR YELLING.

11:05.800 --> 11:07.967
ERIC, UPSTAIRS.

11:07.967 --> 11:11.133
NO, NO, I HEAR YELLING.
I'M NOT INVOLVED.
I'M STAYING.

11:11.133 --> 11:14.100
YOU CANNOT MAKE
ADULT LIFE DECISIONS

11:14.100 --> 11:16.500
WITHOUT ADULT LIFE
EXPERIENCES BEHIND
THOSE DECISIONS

11:16.500 --> 11:17.934
TO MAKE THEM STAND UP.

11:17.934 --> 11:21.300
MOM, I LOVE HER.

11:21.300 --> 11:22.867
SO YOU SAY, CORY.

11:22.867 --> 11:28.300
BUT WHAT DOES LOVE MEAN
TO YOU AT 16 YEARS OLD?

11:28.300 --> 11:31.200
I HAVE BEEN WITH YOUR FATHER
FOR 22 YEARS,

11:31.200 --> 11:32.467
AND I AM JUST NOW

11:32.467 --> 11:36.100
BEGINNING TO REALIZE
WHAT LOVE REALLY MEANS.

11:36.100 --> 11:36.867
WAIT RIGHT THERE.

11:36.867 --> 11:39.033
WAS I A BIG SURPRISE?

11:40.467 --> 11:42.400
OK, CORY,
YOU EDUCATE ME.

11:42.400 --> 11:45.033
YOU TELL ME WHAT
LOVE MEANS TO YOU.

11:45.033 --> 11:47.467
MOM, LISTEN,
I HAVEN'T BEEN
TOGETHER WITH TOPANGA

11:47.467 --> 11:50.300
FOR 22 YEARS,
BUT WE HAVE BEEN
TOGETHER FOR 16, OK?

11:50.300 --> 11:54.367
THAT'S A LOT LONGER
THAN MOST COUPLES
HAVE BEEN TOGETHER.

11:54.367 --> 11:56.133
I MEAN,
WHEN WE WERE BORN,

11:56.133 --> 11:58.000
YOU TOLD ME THAT
WE USED TO TAKE WALKS

11:58.000 --> 12:00.133
IN OUR STROLLERS
TOGETHER
AROUND THE BLOCK.

12:00.133 --> 12:03.233
WHEN WE WERE 2,
WE WERE BEST FRIENDS.

12:03.233 --> 12:04.900
I KNEW EVERYTHING
ABOUT THIS GIRL.

12:04.900 --> 12:06.400
I KNEW
HER FAVORITE COLOR.

12:06.400 --> 12:07.734
I KNEW HER
FAVORITE FOOD.

12:07.734 --> 12:11.834
THEN WE GOT TO BE 6,
AND ERIC MADE FUN OF ME

12:11.834 --> 12:14.200
BECAUSE IT WASN'T COOL
TO HAVE A BEST FRIEND
THAT'S A GIRL

12:14.200 --> 12:15.667
OR TO EVEN KNOW A GIRL.

12:15.667 --> 12:19.200
YEAH, AND YOU LISTENED
TO ME. IDIOT.

12:19.200 --> 12:22.800
SO FOR THE NEXT 7 YEARS,
I THREW DIRT AT HER.

12:22.800 --> 12:25.000
I LIKE TO CALL THOSE
THE LOST YEARS.

12:26.800 --> 12:29.000
YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO MADE HIM
THROW DIRT AT ME?

12:29.000 --> 12:30.500
YOU WERE A GIRL,
NOOGIEHEAD.

12:32.400 --> 12:33.867
THEN WHEN I WAS 13, MOM,

12:33.867 --> 12:35.567
SHE PUT ME
UP AGAINST MY LOCKER,

12:35.567 --> 12:37.967
AND SHE KISSED ME.

12:37.967 --> 12:39.900
I MEAN, SHE GAVE ME
MY FIRST KISS.

12:39.900 --> 12:42.100
SHE TAUGHT ME
HOW TO DANCE.

12:42.100 --> 12:44.600
SHE ALWAYS WAS TALKING
ABOUT THESE CRAZY
THINGS,

12:44.600 --> 12:47.400
AND I NEVER UNDERSTOOD
A WORD SHE SAID.

12:47.400 --> 12:48.800
ALL I UNDERSTOOD
WAS THAT

12:48.800 --> 12:52.500
SHE WAS THE GIRL
I SAT UP EVERY NIGHT
THINKING ABOUT.

12:52.500 --> 12:57.400
AND WHEN I'M WITH HER,
I FEEL HAPPY
TO BE ALIVE,

12:57.400 --> 12:59.867
LIKE I CAN DO ANYTHING.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.467
EVEN TALK TO YOU
LIKE THIS.

13:06.233 --> 13:09.400
SO THAT'S--THAT'S WHAT
I THINK IS LOVE, MOM:

13:09.400 --> 13:12.200
WHEN I'M BETTER
BECAUSE SHE'S HERE.

13:16.367 --> 13:17.400
AND NOW SHE WON'T BE.

13:19.834 --> 13:21.500
SO I'M FINISHED.

13:26.700 --> 13:30.300
I THINK IT'S A GOOD THING
THAT CORY'S THE ONLY BOY
I'VE EVER LOVED.

13:30.300 --> 13:32.200
I WAS LOOKING FORWARD

13:32.200 --> 13:35.600
TO DOING ALL THE THINGS
THAT PEOPLE DO WHO ARE
IN LOVE...

13:35.600 --> 13:37.100
WITH CORY...

13:37.100 --> 13:40.467
AND NOT WITH JUST
SOME GUY IN PITTSBURGH
BECAUSE I'M THERE.

13:42.600 --> 13:43.834
WELL, SHOULD I CALL
THE CATERERS?

13:45.967 --> 13:46.967
[DOORBELL RINGS]

13:46.967 --> 13:49.000
NEVER MIND.
THEY'RE HERE.

13:51.100 --> 13:53.600
NO. THAT WOULD BE
TOPANGA'S AUNT.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.800
MY AUNT?
AUNT PRUDENCE?

13:55.800 --> 13:58.734
YOUR PARENTS SAID
THEY WERE GOING TO CALL HER.

13:58.734 --> 14:00.700
HEY, MAYBE SHE'LL BE
ON OUR SIDE.

14:00.700 --> 14:02.233
NO, NOT MY AUNT.

14:02.233 --> 14:04.967
WELL, MAYBE
SHE'LL REALIZE THAT
WE'RE ROMEO AND JULIET.

14:04.967 --> 14:06.200
WE BELONG TOGETHER.

14:06.200 --> 14:08.567
MY AUNT HAS
NEVER BEEN IN LOVE,
NEVER BEEN MARRIED,

14:08.567 --> 14:10.233
AND WOULDN'T KNOW WHO
ROMEO AND JULIET WERE.

14:15.967 --> 14:17.600
HELLO. I'M TOPANGA'S AUNT.

14:17.600 --> 14:20.133
OK. NOW,
HOW'S THAT POSSIBLE?

14:20.133 --> 14:22.934
BECAUSE MY AUNT LOOKS
LIKE AN ELEPHANT.

14:22.934 --> 14:25.900
THAT IS MY SISTER
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

14:25.900 --> 14:27.200
SHE DOES, MAN.

14:28.900 --> 14:30.200
HI. I'M ALAN MATTHEWS.

14:30.200 --> 14:32.300
THIS IS MY WIFE AMY.

14:32.300 --> 14:33.467
PRUDENCE CURTIS.

14:33.467 --> 14:34.800
HELLO, TOPANGA.

14:34.800 --> 14:36.233
AUNT PRU.

14:36.233 --> 14:39.233
AND THIS MUST BE
THE YOUNG MAN WHO HAS
MY NIECE SO SMITTEN.

14:39.233 --> 14:40.834
HI, UH, I'M
CORY MATTHEWS.

14:40.834 --> 14:42.400
LISTEN, YOU'RE
MY LAST CHANCE.

14:42.400 --> 14:44.033
PLEASE DON'T TAKE HER AWAY.

14:44.033 --> 14:48.300
I'M SORRY, CORY,
BUT MY INSTRUCTIONS ARE
TO TAKE TOPANGA HOME WITH ME

14:48.300 --> 14:51.233
AND PUT HER
ON THE TRAIN TO PITTSBURGH
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.

14:51.233 --> 14:52.233
CORY, HELP.

14:52.233 --> 14:53.867
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO, OK?

14:53.867 --> 14:57.800
EVERYONE SEEMS
TO WANT US APART.
EXCEPT DAD.

14:57.800 --> 15:00.667
DAD, YOU REALLY HAVEN'T
SAID ANYTHING DURING
THIS WHOLE TIME.

15:00.667 --> 15:03.000
ARE YOU GOING TO LET HER
TAKE HER AWAY?

15:05.367 --> 15:09.000
I DON'T THINK
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.500
WHAT?

15:10.500 --> 15:14.934
WELL, YOU KNOW,
YOU MAY HAVE KNOWN TOPANGA
SINCE YOU WERE BORN,

15:14.934 --> 15:18.600
BUT I'VE KNOWN YOUR MOTHER,
LIKE, FOREVER, OK?

15:18.600 --> 15:19.767
SO?

15:19.767 --> 15:22.667
SO, WHAT I KNOW
ABOUT YOUR MOTHER,

15:22.667 --> 15:25.500
BESIDES HER FAVORITE
FOOD AND COLOR,

15:25.500 --> 15:28.000
SPAGHETTI AND RED,

15:28.000 --> 15:31.233
AND THE THING THAT I
RESPECT IN HER THE MOST

15:31.233 --> 15:35.300
IS THAT SHE HAS ALWAYS
PUT HER FAITH IN LOVE,

15:35.300 --> 15:38.300
WHEN SHE SEES IT,
WHEN SHE RECOGNIZES IT.

15:41.600 --> 15:44.000
WHICH IS WHY
SHE CHOSE ME...

15:44.000 --> 15:48.200
WHEN HER PARENTS
TOLD HER NOT TO.

15:48.200 --> 15:51.100
YEAH, BUT, DAD,
SHE WANTS US TO HAVE
OTHER RELATIONSHIPS.

15:51.100 --> 15:52.667
LOVE IS FAITH, CORY.

15:52.667 --> 15:55.367
DO YOU LOVE YOUR MOTHER?

15:55.367 --> 15:58.200
YEAH,
OF COURSE I DO.

15:58.200 --> 16:00.967
THEN HAVE FAITH.

16:13.033 --> 16:15.000
IT WOULD BE...

16:16.133 --> 16:18.900
WRONG...

16:18.900 --> 16:20.700
FOR TOPANGA
TO GO BACK TO PITTSBURGH.

16:23.567 --> 16:25.834
GUESS I HAVE
A LOT TO LEARN.

16:27.467 --> 16:29.500
CERTAINLY YOU'RE
NOT SUGGESTING

16:29.500 --> 16:33.133
THAT I LET SOME PUPPY LOVE
BETWEEN TWO 16-YEAR-OLD
CHILDREN

16:33.133 --> 16:34.834
INTERFERE WITH HER
PARENTS' WISHES?

16:34.834 --> 16:40.700
I AM SUGGESTING
THAT TOPANGA WAS BORN
IN PHILADELPHIA

16:40.700 --> 16:42.967
AND HAS SPENT
HER ENTIRE LIFE HERE.

16:42.967 --> 16:46.700
ALL OF HER FRIENDS,
EVERYTHING SHE KNOWS
IS HERE.

16:46.700 --> 16:49.133
AND TO RIP HER
OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL
IN HER JUNIOR YEAR

16:49.133 --> 16:50.900
AND DRAG HER TO PITTSBURGH

16:50.900 --> 16:52.500
WHERE SHE HAS TO MAKE
NEW FRIENDS FOR ONE YEAR,

16:52.500 --> 16:54.834
AND THEN HAVE TO LEAVE
AGAIN FOR COLLEGE IS...

16:54.834 --> 16:56.400
IRRESPONSIBLE.

16:56.400 --> 17:00.400
ARE YOU SAYING THAT MY
SISTER AND BROTHER-IN-LAW
ARE IRRESPONSIBLE?

17:01.967 --> 17:03.300
YES, I AM.

17:03.300 --> 17:06.100
THEN KEEP TALKING.

17:11.600 --> 17:15.000
I HAVE KNOWN TOPANGA
FOR 16 YEARS, TOO.

17:18.400 --> 17:20.100
IT'S HARD
NOT TO LOVE HER.

17:22.734 --> 17:25.834
EVERYTHING CORY
SAYS SHE IS, SHE IS.

17:29.834 --> 17:32.667
AND NO MATTER HOW OLD
CORY IS,

17:32.667 --> 17:35.967
IT WILL BE HARD FOR HIM
TO FIND BETTER.

17:37.700 --> 17:39.233
MOM...

17:40.767 --> 17:42.500
YOU'RE MY SON.

17:42.500 --> 17:45.100
I NEVER WANT YOU
TO BE IN PAIN.

17:46.600 --> 17:49.367
TOPANGA, CORY,

17:49.367 --> 17:52.767
WOULD YOU EXCUSE US
SO THAT I MAY SPEAK
TO MR. AND MRS. MATTHEWS?

18:03.133 --> 18:05.934
OH, I'M STAYING.

18:10.600 --> 18:14.834
MR. MATTHEWS,
MISS LAWRENCE.

18:14.834 --> 18:16.900
NO, NO. THIS ISN'T
THE CLASSROOM,
MR. MATTHEWS.

18:16.900 --> 18:18.900
AS YOU WERE.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.700
EVEN THOUGH THIS
ISN'T THE CLASSROOM
AT THE MOMENT,

18:23.700 --> 18:28.400
WOULD YOU MIND
IF I TAUGHT YOU
A LESSON ANYWAY?

18:28.400 --> 18:30.500
PLEASE.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.133
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

18:32.133 --> 18:34.800
THERE WAS A TIME
IN MY LIFE

18:34.800 --> 18:37.867
WHEN I CARED
FOR SOMEONE
AS DEEPLY

18:37.867 --> 18:41.033
AS YOU TWO CARE
FOR EACH OTHER NOW.

18:41.033 --> 18:44.400
YOU BELIEVE
WE LOVE EACH OTHER?

18:44.400 --> 18:47.200
AND FOR NO REASON
I UNDERSTOOD,

18:47.200 --> 18:49.400
MY WIFE
WAS TAKEN FROM ME,

18:49.400 --> 18:53.400
AND I HAVEN'T BEEN
SO DEEPLY IN LOVE SINCE.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.867
FEENY BELIEVES
WE LOVE EACH OTHER.

18:55.867 --> 18:58.300
I BELIEVE THAT
WHEN YOU FIND LOVE,

18:58.300 --> 19:00.734
YOU HOLD ONTO IT

19:00.734 --> 19:02.867
AND CHERISH IT,

19:02.867 --> 19:06.800
BECAUSE THERE IS
NOTHING FINER,

19:06.800 --> 19:08.500
AND IT MAY NEVER
COME AGAIN.

19:08.500 --> 19:10.100
AND THAT, MY DEARS,

19:10.100 --> 19:13.967
IS THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING THAT
I COULD TEACH YOU.

19:13.967 --> 19:15.900
WHO IS THAT GUY?

19:17.233 --> 19:18.700
THAT'S MR. FEENY.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.600
HE KNOWS EVERYTHING.

19:20.600 --> 19:22.467
NO, HE DOESN'T.

19:25.500 --> 19:28.400
BEG YOUR PARDON?

19:28.400 --> 19:30.033
PRUDENCE CURTIS.

19:30.033 --> 19:31.500
I'M TOPANGA'S AUNT.

19:31.500 --> 19:33.233
GEORGE FEENY.

19:33.233 --> 19:34.834
I'M TOPANGA'S TEACHER.

19:34.834 --> 19:37.000
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
THAT I APPRECIATE

19:37.000 --> 19:39.100
WHAT YOU'RE TEACHING
THESE CHILDREN, SIR.

19:39.100 --> 19:41.300
TO PLANT WILD IDEAS
ABOUT TRUE LOVE

19:41.300 --> 19:43.300
IN YOUNG
UNDEVELOPED MINDS

19:43.300 --> 19:46.900
IS AS IRRESPONSIBLE AS MY
SISTER AND BROTHER-IN-LAW

19:46.900 --> 19:48.467
RIPPING HER FROM
THE ONLY ENVIRONMENT
SHE'S EVER KNOWN

19:48.467 --> 19:51.567
AT THIS DELICATE TIME.

19:51.567 --> 19:56.667
MADAM, IF YOU
CHOOSE TO QUESTION
MY OPINIONS,

19:56.667 --> 19:58.367
THEN YOU DISREGARD
38 YEARS

19:58.367 --> 20:01.500
IN THE PUBLIC
SCHOOL SYSTEM

20:01.500 --> 20:05.834
WHERE I HAVE BORNE
THE RESPONSIBILITY
OF THOSE OPINIONS

20:05.834 --> 20:08.467
FOR 30,000 STUDENTS,

20:08.467 --> 20:10.800
NONE HELD
IN HIGHER REGARD

20:10.800 --> 20:13.400
THAN MR. MATTHEWS
AND MISS LAWRENCE.

20:13.400 --> 20:14.400
YOU LIKE ME?

20:14.400 --> 20:16.600
STAY OUT OF THIS.

20:16.600 --> 20:19.300
THE ONLY THING
I PRESUME, SIR,

20:19.300 --> 20:22.400
IS THAT YOU ARE AS VERBOSE
AS YOU ARE SNAPPY.

20:25.834 --> 20:26.734
WELL, THEN...

20:29.467 --> 20:32.700
THERE WE ARE.

20:32.700 --> 20:35.500
TOPANGA, YOUR AUNT
HAS SOMETHING TO TELL YOU.

20:39.967 --> 20:42.000
I HAVE SPOKEN
TO YOUR PARENTS,

20:42.000 --> 20:47.467
AND WHILE I DON'T CONDONE
THE INTENSITY OR EXCLUSIVITY
OF THIS RELATIONSHIP,

20:47.467 --> 20:50.900
I ALSO CANNOT CONDONE
THE ACTIONS OF MY SISTER
AND BROTHER-IN-LAW.

20:50.900 --> 20:55.133
THEREFORE I'VE DECIDED,
AND THEY HAVE AGREED,

20:55.133 --> 20:56.834
THAT IF YOU'D LIKE
TO LIVE WITH ME

20:56.834 --> 20:59.100
DURING THE REMAINDER
OF YOUR HIGH SCHOOL
EDUCATION,

20:59.700 --> 21:02.467
I'D BE HAPPY TO HAVE YOU.

21:02.467 --> 21:04.133
<i>I'M </i>VERBOSE?

21:06.600 --> 21:08.100
DID YOU HEAR
WHAT SHE SAID?

21:08.100 --> 21:09.767
YEAH, SHE SAID
YOU'RE STAYING HERE.
