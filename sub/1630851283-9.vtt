THERE'S SO MUCH CARGO ARRIVING
FROM ASIA THAT SOME OF IT HAS
BEEN DIVERTED TO OTHER PORTS IN

02:45.365 --> 02:54.107
THE COUNTRY.
IT'S LED TO AN EPIC TRAFFIC JAM
THAT NO ONE SEEMS ABLE TO

03:11.691 --> 03:17.564
WE WANTED TO SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE
IN THE BUSIEST PORTS IN THE
COUNTRY.
BUT FIRST, WE HAD TO GET ON

03:17.630 --> 03:27.240
BOARD.
SPACE AT THE LONG BEACH DOCKS IS
SO TIGHT THAT WHEN A SLOT OPENED
UP AT 1:00 A.M., THE PORT PILOTS

03:27.307 --> 03:40.687
WASTED NO TIME.
THEY SPED OFF INTO THE DARK.
AND SO DID WE, FOLLOWING CAPTAIN
JAMES DWYER UP A ROPE LADDER AS

03:40.753 --> 03:47.894
HE CLIMBED ABOARD TO GUIDE THE
GIANT SHIP, THE "EVER LINKING,"
TO AN OPEN BERTH.
>> Captain James Dwyer: WE'RE

03:47.961 --> 03:54.634
INBOUND FOR L.A. BERTH 405.
>> Whitaker: STEERING THE SHIP
THROUGH THE HARBOR, HE TOLD US
PILOTS ARE HANDLING TWICE THE

03:54.701 --> 04:01.207
USUAL NUMBER OF VESSELS.
>> Dwyer: RIGHT NOW, WE'RE IN--
JUST IN OUR SLOW TURN TO PORT,
TO GET ONTO THE MAIN CHANNEL.

04:01.274 --> 04:09.582
>> Whitaker: WITH THE PORT
GLITTERING IN THE DISTANCE,
CAPTAIN DWYER FROM THE BRIDGE,
SLOWLY TURNED THE 100,000-TON

04:09.649 --> 04:14.887
SHIP AROUND.
>> Dwyer: STOP ENGINE, BILL.
>> Whitaker: WE'LL BACK UP?
>> Dwyer: YES, SIR, WE'RE GOING

04:14.954 --> 04:21.461
TO GO STERN-FIRST.
BOW STOP.
>> Whitaker: WE FOUND THIS FEAT
OF PARALLEL PARKING,

04:21.527 --> 04:27.900
<i>UNPARALLELED.</i>
>> Dwyer: PUSH EASY.
>> Whitaker: FOR THE LAST FEW
YARDS AND INCHES, CAPTAIN DWYER

04:27.967 --> 04:35.642
STUCK HIS HEAD OUT THE WINDOW TO
GUIDE THE BEHEMOTH IN BY SIGHT.
>> Dwyer: CAN WE LET GO OF THE
TUG LINE AFT, LET GO OF THE TUG

04:35.708 --> 04:41.414
LINE, EASY, EASY.
>> Whitaker: IT TURNS OUT
DOCKING A SHIP THE SIZE OF THREE
FOOTBALL FIELDS IS THE EASY

04:41.481 --> 04:47.153
PART.
HOW ABOUT THAT!
GETTING THE GOODS FROM HERE TO
STORE SHELVES IS PROVING TO BE A

04:47.220 --> 04:56.629
LOT MORE DAUNTING.
IT USED TO TAKE TWO DAYS TO GET
CARGO OFF THE DOCKS.
NOW, IT TAKES NINE.

04:56.696 --> 05:07.173
TO SEE WHY, WE TOOK TO THE AIR
WITH RYAN PETERSEN, C.E.O. OF
FLEXPORT, A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY
THAT BUYS AND SELLS CARGO SPACE.

05:07.240 --> 05:13.312
LOOK AT HOW PACKED THIS IS HERE.
>> Ryan Peterson: YEAH, TOTALLY
PACKED.
>> Whitaker: WE FLEW OVER THE

05:13.379 --> 05:21.187
SPRAWLING PORTS OF LOS ANGELES
AND LONG BEACH-- 40% OF ALL U.S.
IMPORTS COME THROUGH HERE.
WE SAW STACKS OF MAROONED

05:21.254 --> 05:32.665
CONTAINERS, DORMANT CRANES,
LOADED RAIL CARS SITTING IDLE.
THE COUNTRY'S BUSIEST PORTS
PACKED TO THE GILLS.

05:32.732 --> 05:40.773
AND OUT AT SEA?
MORE THAN 80 SHIPS STRETCHED TO
THE DISTANCE-- A NEW RECORD.
THEY USED TO PULL RIGHT IN.

05:40.840 --> 05:47.146
NOW, THEY CAN WAIT WEEKS.
PETERSEN TOLD US THIS BACKLOG
HAS BEEN BUILDING SINCE THE
START OF THE PANDEMIC.

05:47.213 --> 05:50.616
IS IT GETTING WORSE?
>> Peterson: IT'S DEFINITELY
GETTING WORSE.
IT'S AS BAD AS IT'S EVER BEEN

05:50.683 --> 05:54.487
RIGHT NOW.
RIGHT THERE, DO YOU SEE ALL
THOSE BLUE CRANES?
THERE'S NO SHIP--

05:54.554 --> 05:57.623
>> Whitaker: THAT MAKES NO
SENSE.
>> Peterson: THAT'S WHAT--
THAT'S WHAT I SAY.

05:57.690 --> 06:03.396
IT MAKES NO SENSE.
UNTIL YOU REALIZE, HEY, THE YARD
IS TOTALLY FULL.
SEE HOW HIGH THOSE STACKS ARE?

06:03.463 --> 06:08.401
TOTALLY JAMMED UP.
>> Whitaker: SO, WHEN YOU SEE
THIS, WHAT-- WHAT DOES THIS SAY
TO YOU?

06:08.468 --> 06:13.806
>> Peterson: I THINK A LOT OF
BUSINESSES ARE AT RISK, IF THEY
CAN'T GET THEIR PRODUCTS IN-- IN
TIME FOR THE HOLIDAY SEASON.

06:13.873 --> 06:17.076
AND OF COURSE, IT ALSO MEANS
CONSUMERS ARE GOING TO PAY
REALLY HIGH PRICES FOR
EVERYTHING.

06:17.143 --> 06:22.482
>> Whitaker: SO THIS IS WHAT
INFLATION LOOKS LIKE?
>> Peterson: YEAH, THIS IS
INFLATION FIRST-HAND.

06:22.548 --> 06:29.188
>> Whitaker: THE PROBLEMS AT THE
PORTS HAVE CASCADED ACROSS THE
COUNTRY.
SO WE FOLLOWED THE SUPPLY CHAIN,

06:29.255 --> 06:37.730
FROM THE CHOKED PORTS OF L.A.
AND LONG BEACH TO RAIL YARDS IN
CHICAGO.
ALONG THE WAY WE FOUND CHAOS,

06:37.797 --> 06:50.877
FINGER-POINTING, HUGE PROFITS,
AND MASSIVE LOSSES.
AND EVERYWHERE, FRUSTRATION.
BOBBY DJAVAHERI'S FRUSTRATION

06:50.943 --> 06:56.149
WAS PALPABLE WHEN HE LIFTED HIS
WAREHOUSE DOOR TO SHOW US
INSIDE.
SO, WHAT-- WHAT SHOULD THIS LOOK

06:56.215 --> 07:04.423
LIKE?
>> Bobby Djavaheri: YEAH, YOU--
YOU, RIGHT HERE, YOU WOULDN'T BE
ABLE TO WALK IN HERE.

07:04.490 --> 07:08.761
I MEAN, WE GOT BOXES ALL THE WAY
TO THE CEILING.
THIS WOULD BE FULLY FULL.
>> Whitaker: SO WHAT DO YOU

07:08.828 --> 07:12.899
THINK WHEN YOU SEE IT LIKE THIS?
>> Djavaheri: IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
THERE'S NEVER BEEN A MONTH
THAT'S-- THAT'S-- THAT'S EMPTY--

07:12.965 --> 07:16.135
EVER.
THE FACT THAT CHRISTMAS IS
AROUND THE CORNER AND IT'S
EMPTY, IT'S SHOCKING.

07:16.202 --> 07:23.242
>> Whitaker: DJAVARHERI RUNS
YEDI HOUSEWARE, HE IMPORTS
HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES FROM CHINA.
HE TOLD US HIS GOODS HAVE BEEN

07:23.309 --> 07:33.119
DELAYED FOR SIX MONTHS.
NOW, HE HAS THOUSANDS OF ORDERS
HE CAN'T FILL, AND HIS SHIPPING
COSTS HAVE SOARED FROM $2,000 A

07:33.186 --> 07:39.325
CONTAINER TO AS HIGH AS $25,000.
HE BLAMES THIS CRISIS ON THE
OCEAN CARRIERS.
>> Djavaheri: I CALL THEM

07:39.392 --> 07:44.630
PIRATES OF THE SEA.
THEY'RE 100% PRICE-GOUGING, AND
NO ONE'S DONE ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
>> Whitaker: IT'S NOT JUST

07:44.697 --> 07:50.269
MARKET FORCES?
>> Djavaheri: NO.
NO, I-- I REALLY DON'T BUY IT.
IT'S PRICE-GOUGING, AND IT'S

07:50.336 --> 07:53.673
SOMEONE TAKING ADVANTAGE.
>> Whitaker: AND IT'S HURTING
YOUR BUSINESS?
>> Djavaheri: YEAH, IT'S HURTING

07:53.739 --> 07:58.411
MY BUSINESS, AND MANY OTHER
PEOPLE'S BUSINESSES.
>> Gene Seroka: THERE'S TOO MUCH
COMING IN THROUGH THE U.S.

07:58.477 --> 08:03.316
SUPPLY CHAIN, AND IT'S NOT
LEAVING THE PORT FAST ENOUGH.
>> Whitaker: SO THAT'S WHY
YOU'VE GOT THESE SHIPS BACKED UP

08:03.382 --> 08:08.154
HERE?
>> Seroka: THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Whitaker: GENE SEROKA IS THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE L.A.

08:08.221 --> 08:16.362
PORT.
HE TOLD US THE ENTIRE SYSTEM HAS
BEEN OVERWHELMED BY THE TSUNAMI
OF ORDERS FLOODING IN FROM ASIA.

08:16.429 --> 08:22.435
WHO IS MAKING MONEY OFF OF THIS?
WHO IS BENEFITING FROM THIS
BACKLOG?
>> Seroka: LINER SHIPPING

08:22.501 --> 08:28.040
COMPANIES WILL MAKE RECORD
PROFITS THIS YEAR, AGAIN.
THEY'RE BOOKING MORE CARGO THAN
EVER BEFORE.

08:28.107 --> 08:32.511
THERE'S A SUPPLY/DEMAND ISSUE.
>> Whitaker: SO THE PRICE JUST
KEEPS GOING UP AND UP?
>> Seroka: PRICES SKYROCKETED ON

08:32.578 --> 08:37.583
THESE TRANS-PACIFIC TRADE
ROUTES.
THERE'S MONEY BEING MADE.
>> Whitaker: THIS MONTH, THE

08:37.650 --> 08:46.926
WORLD'S LARGEST SHIPPING LINE,
MAERSK, REPORTED RECORD PROFITS
OF $16 BILLION-- UP 68% FROM
LAST YEAR.

08:46.993 --> 08:54.333
THE OCEAN CARRIERS-- MOST
HEADQUARTERED IN EUROPE OR ASIA-
- SAY DEMAND FOR CARGO SPACE
KEEPS RISING.

08:54.400 --> 09:02.208
THEY BLAME A SHORTAGE OF
TRUCKERS AT THE PORT.
TAKE AN EMPTY IN, TAKE A FULL
CONTAINER OUT.

09:02.275 --> 09:07.947
WHERE IS THIS FALLING APART?
>> Matt Schrap: IN THE FACT THAT
WE, BECAUSE OF THE BOOKING
SYSTEMS, HAVE RESTRICTIONS ON

09:08.014 --> 09:14.453
THE TYPE OF CONTAINER THAT YOU
CAN BRING IN.
>> Whitaker: MATT SCHRAP, OF THE
HARBOR TRUCKING ASSOCIATION,

09:14.520 --> 09:20.626
TOLD US THERE'S NO DRIVER
SHORTAGE AT THE PORTS.
HE SAYS IT'S THE ANTIQUATED
BOOKING SYSTEM THAT'S GUMMING UP

09:20.693 --> 09:26.899
THE WORKS.
SCHRAP TOLD US, NORMALLY,
TRUCKERS MAKE AN APPOINTMENT TO
RETURN AN EMPTY CONTAINER BEFORE

09:26.966 --> 09:33.806
PICKING UP A FULL ONE.
BUT WITH SO LITTLE SPACE AT THE
PORTS, THERE ARE NEW
RESTRICTIONS ON EVEN THE<i> COLOR</i>

09:33.873 --> 09:39.712
OF CONTAINERTHAT CAN BE
RETURNED.
TRUCKERS CAN WAIT HOURS IN LINE
ONLY TO BE TURNED AWAY BECAUSE

09:39.779 --> 09:46.819
THERE'S NO ROOM.
SOME OF THE TERMINALS WILL SAY
THAT THE NO-SHOWS OF YOUR
DRIVERS-- 50% OF THE TIME THEY

09:46.886 --> 09:51.824
DON'T SHOW UP.
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT?
>> Schrap: WELL, WE MAKE
APPOINTMENTS BECAUSE WE DON'T

09:51.891 --> 09:57.196
KNOW SOMETIMES UNTIL THE DAY OF,
WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE GOING TO BE
ABLE TO RETURN AN EMPTY
CONTAINER BACK INTO THAT MARINE

09:57.263 --> 10:01.801
TERMINAL.
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE
DAY OF, THEY SAY, "SORRY, WE'RE
NOT TAKING ANY MORE RUST-COLORED

10:01.867 --> 10:06.605
CONTAINERS."
SO IT'S JUST-- YOU KNOW, IT'S
JUST-- IT'S A GAME OF WHACK-A-
MOLE, LITERALLY.

10:06.672 --> 10:15.348
>> Whitaker: THE RESULT?
LOTS LIKE THIS, FULL OF EMPTY
CONTAINERS SITTING ON CHASSIS,
THE UNDERCARRIAGE THAT HOLDS THE

10:15.414 --> 10:19.685
CONTAINER AND ATTACHES TO A
TRUCK.
>> Schrap: WITHOUT A CHASSIS,
YOU CANNOT MOVE THOSE CONTAINERS

10:19.752 --> 10:25.491
OFF OF DOCK.
AND THE MAJORITY OF CHASSIS ARE
SITTING UNDER EMPTY CONTAINERS,
STREWN AROUND CALIFORNIA.

10:25.558 --> 10:31.497
>> Whitaker: SO, THE CHASSIS ARE
NECESSARY TO MOVE THE FULL
CONTAINERS OUT OF THE PORT?
>> Schrap: ABSOLUTELY.

10:31.564 --> 10:36.702
>> Whitaker: BUT MOST OF THESE
CHASSIS ARE NOW BEING USED JUST
TO HOLD EMPTY CONTAINERS.
>> Schrap: THAT'S CORRECT.

10:36.769 --> 10:41.340
>> Whitaker: THIS IS THE
DEFINITION OF A BOTTLENECK.
>> Schrap: ABSOLUTELY.
>> Rick Woldenberg: PEOPLE ARE

10:41.407 --> 10:46.912
ORDERING EARLY AND...
>> Whitaker: THAT'S NOT THE ONLY
CHOKE POINT.
IN CHICAGO, WE MET RICK

10:46.979 --> 10:59.225
WOLDENBERG AT HIS FAMILY'S TOY
BUSINESS, LEARNING RESOURCES.
EVERY YEAR, HE IMPORTS TOYS FROM
CHINA AND BRINGS THEM HERE BY

10:59.291 --> 11:07.366
RAIL.
HE TOLD US, THIS YEAR HAS BEEN A
NIGHTMARE.
HOW LONG IS IT TAKING TO GET THE

11:07.433 --> 11:14.173
PRODUCT FROM LOS ANGELES HERE?
>> Woldenberg: I'D ESTIMATE THAT
THE DOMESTIC LEAD TIME IS 45
DAYS.

11:14.240 --> 11:20.613
AND THAT'S UNBELIEVABLY SLOW.
PONY EXPRESS COULD HAVE GOTTEN
IT HERE FASTER.
>> Whitaker: WOLDENBERG TOLD US

11:20.679 --> 11:26.185
HE TRIED TO AVOID THE BACKLOG BY
PLACING HIS CHRISTMAS ORDERS IN
<i>MAY...</i>
>> Woldenberg: IT'S A TOY IN IT

11:26.252 --> 11:33.926
FOR CHRISTMAS.
>> Whitaker: ...ONLY TO HIT A
MONUMENTAL SNAG IN CHICAGO.
THERE WAS SO MUCH CARGO AT THE

11:33.993 --> 11:39.765
RAIL YARDS, THAT HIS CONTAINERS
GOT STUCK AT THE BOTTOM OF A
PILE FOR NINE WEEKS.
HE TOLD US IT WAS LIKE HAVING

11:39.832 --> 11:46.806
HIS TOYS HELD HOSTAGE.
THE KICKER?
THE RAIL LINE CHARGED HIM FOR
"STORAGE."

11:46.872 --> 11:53.646
THIS, ON TOP OF PAYING $30,000
FOR A CONTAINER FROM CHINA-- TEN
TIMES WHAT HE PAID LAST YEAR.
>> Woldenberg: IF THAT WERE AS

11:53.712 --> 12:00.419
BAD AS IT WAS, THAT WOULD STILL
BE HORRIBLE, BUT IT GETS WORSE,
BECAUSE WE GET PENALIZED FOR
STORAGE.

12:00.486 --> 12:12.431
AND THAT'S WHERE IT BECOMES THE
THEATRE OF THE ABSURD.
SO, THE $25,000 TO $30,000 IS
THE MARKET GONE BERSERK, BUT

12:12.498 --> 12:17.636
PENALTIES ARE A PUNISHMENT THAT
IS UNCONSCIONABLE.
>> Whitaker: SO, WAIT A MINUTE.
YOUR-- YOUR CARGO IS BEING HELD

12:17.703 --> 12:22.141
UP?
>> Woldenberg: RIGHT.
>> Whitaker: FOR NOTHING YOU
HAVE DONE WRONG?

12:22.208 --> 12:26.545
>> Woldenberg: CORRECT.
>> Whitaker: YOU CAN'T GO PICK
IT UP?
>> Woldenberg: CORRECT.

12:26.612 --> 12:31.817
>> Whitaker: BUT YOU HAVE TO PAY
FOR IT TO BE STORED?
>> Woldenberg: CORRECT.
>> Whitaker: THE RAIL YARDS TOLD

12:31.884 --> 12:39.825
US IT WAS ALL DUE TO CONGESTION.
RICK WOLDENBERG TOLD US HE PAID
ALMOST A MILLION DOLLARS IN
STORAGE FEES IN SEPTEMBER ALONE.

12:39.892 --> 12:45.331
>> Whitaker: CAN YOU AFFORD
THIS?
>> Woldenberg: NO, I CAN'T.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO ABSORB THIS

12:45.397 --> 12:53.506
KIND OF EXPENSE.
SO WE HAD TO RAISE OUR PRICES.
THESE PENALTIES ARE GRATUITOUS.
THEY'RE NOT INCURRING EXTRA

12:53.572 --> 12:59.545
EXPENSES BECAUSE OF THIS.
>> Whitaker: IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'RE SAYING THEY'RE CHARGING
YOU EXTRA BECAUSE THEY CAN.

12:59.612 --> 13:06.318
>> Woldenberg: SURE FEELS LIKE
IT.
>> Whitaker: NOW, WITH INFLATION
THE HIGHEST IN 30 YEARS AND THE

13:06.385 --> 13:14.026
HOLIDAYS FAST-APPROACHING,
THERE'S A FLURRY OF PLANS TO
BREAK THE LOGJAM.
STARTING TOMORROW, GENE SEROKA,

13:14.093 --> 13:21.634
WHO RUNS THE L.A. PORT, SAYS
HE'LL FINE THE SHIPPING LINES
FOR ANY CARGO THAT SITS ON THE
DOCKS MORE THAN NINE DAYS.

13:21.700 --> 13:28.807
AND LAST MONTH, PRESIDENT JOE
BIDEN ANNOUNCED THE PORTS HAD
AGREED TO WORK ROUND-THE-CLOCK.
BUT IT HASN'T HAD MUCH EFFECT.

13:28.874 --> 13:35.748
>> Seroka: WE TYPICALLY WORK
ABOUT 19 HOURS A DAY HERE.
IT'S THAT 3:00 TO 8:00 A.M.
SHIFT THAT WE'VE ADDED, AND

13:35.814 --> 13:41.487
TRIED TO GET OTHERS TO WORK WITH
US DURING THOSE TIMES AS WELL.
>> Whitaker: SO YOU MIGHT BE
WORKING 24/7, BUT THE WAREHOUSES

13:41.554 --> 13:46.225
ARE NOT.
>> Seroka: THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Whitaker: SO THEY HAVE NO
PLACE FOR THESE GOODS TO GO,

13:46.292 --> 13:51.197
AFTER THEY GET OFF THE SHIP AT
3:00 IN THE MORNING.
>> Seroka: AND THERE, YOU'VE
JUST DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM.

13:51.263 --> 13:57.870
THE CARGO HAS NOWHERE TO GO.
WE'VE GOT TO GET A WORKFORCE IN
THE WAREHOUSES AND THE TRUCKING
INDUSTRY THAT ARE COMPLEMENTARY

13:57.937 --> 14:01.907
TO ALL THIS CARGO THAT IS--
THAT'S COMING IN RIGHT NOW.
>> Whitaker: THERE IS A LOT OF
FINGER-POINTING.

14:01.974 --> 14:06.478
>> Seroka: YES, THERE IS.
>> Whitaker: THE TRUCKERS BLAME
THE TERMINALS; THE TERMINALS
BLAME THE SHIPPERS; THE

14:06.545 --> 14:13.786
RETAILERS BLAME THE TRUCKERS AND
THE SHIPPERS.
HOW DO YOU GET THAT CONTENTIOUS
GROUP TO SIT AT THE TABLE, STOP

14:13.852 --> 14:18.991
POINTING FINGERS, AND ACTUALLY
CLEAR OUT THIS BACKLOG?
>> Seroka: THAT'S BEEN THE
TOUGHEST PART.

14:19.058 --> 14:22.528
WE HAVEN'T MOVED THE NEEDLE YET,
BUT IT'S NOT FOR A LACK OF
TRYING.
AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO JUST

14:22.595 --> 14:27.866
DOUBLE DOWN.
>> Whitaker: THE WHOLE SUPPLY
CHAIN MESS HAS PUT A SPOTLIGHT
ON GLARING DEFICIENCIES IN U.S.

14:27.933 --> 14:36.342
INFRASTRUCTURE.
FLEXPORT'S RYAN PETERSON SAY
THERE'S NO QUICK FIX, AND THE
$17 BILLION IN THE

14:36.408 --> 14:42.114
INFRASTRUCTURE BILL FOR
UPGRADING AMERICA'S PORTS MAY
NOT BE ENOUGH.
>> Peterson: SEE, SINGAPORE

14:42.181 --> 14:46.252
ALONE IS BUILDING A $20 BILLION
CONTAINER TERMINAL RIGHT NOW.
>> Whitaker: HOW DID WE GET TO
THIS?

14:46.318 --> 14:52.958
I MEAN, I'VE SEEN THE PORTS IN
ROTTERDAM AND IN HONG KONG, AND
THEY ARE LIGHT YEARS AHEAD OF
US.

14:53.025 --> 14:59.932
>> Peterson: ONE PROBLEM WITH
THE U.S. SYSTEM IS, WE-- THE
PORTS ARE OWNED BY THE CITIES
THAT THEY'RE IN.

14:59.999 --> 15:06.572
AND ULTIMATELY, THE CAPITAL
EXPENDITURE FOR BUILDING
TERMINALS, FOR DREDGING, FOR,
YOU KNOW, FOR INVESTING IN THESE

15:06.639 --> 15:11.944
PORTS, COMES DOWN TO DECISIONS
MADE AT A LOCAL LEVEL.
YOU KNOW, THIS IS A NATIONAL
INFRASTRUCTURE.

15:12.011 --> 15:16.749
IT'S TO SERVE THE ENTIRE
COUNTRY.
SO, THERE'S A REAL ROLE FOR
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO COME IN

15:16.815 --> 15:23.022
AND STEP IN.
>> Whitaker: THE WHITE HOUSE HAS
PUT A TOP-LEVEL TASK FORCE ON
THE PROBLEM, BUT OTHER THAN

15:23.088 --> 15:30.195
TWISTING ARMS AND WRANGLING
CONCESSIONS, THERE'S NOT MUCH IT
CAN DO IN AN INDUSTRY DOMINATED
BY PRIVATE COMPANIES, FOREIGN

15:30.262 --> 15:37.369
SHIPPING LINES, AND LOCAL PORT
AUTHORITIES.
AND NO ONE WE SPOKE WITH EXPECTS
A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE.

15:37.436 --> 15:40.005
(<i> TICKING</i> )

15:46.745 --> 15:53.485
>> Scott Pelley: ANDREW SULLIVAN
HAS BEEN AN INFLUENTIAL AND
CONTROVERSIAL VOICE FOR MORE
THAN 30 YEARS.

15:53.552 --> 16:01.327
HE'S A CONSERVATIVE AUTHOR,
EDITOR AND BLOGGER.
AS A BRITISH-AMERICAN, HIS STYLE
COMBINES THE PERCEPTION OF AN

16:01.393 --> 16:08.300
OUTSIDER WITH THE DEVOTION OF A
NATIVE SON.
WHEN WE MET, AT HIS HOME ON CAPE
COD, WE FOUND SULLIVAN ANXIOUS

16:08.367 --> 16:15.674
ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE
REPUBLIC.
TOO MANY AMERICANS, HE TOLD US,
ARE NO LONGER THE CITIZENS THAT

16:15.741 --> 16:23.248
THE FOUNDERS WERE COUNTING ON.
>> Andrew Sullivan: THE AMERICAN
CONSTITUTION WAS SET UP FOR
PEOPLE WHO CAN REASON AND ARGUE

16:23.315 --> 16:28.754
AND AREN'T AFRAID OF IT, AND
THEN REACH COMPROMISES.
THE WHOLE THING IS DESIGNED THAT
WAY.

16:28.821 --> 16:35.160
WELL, IF YOU'RE IN A TRIBE, AND
ALL THAT MATTERS IS THE VICTORY
OF YOUR TRIBE, AND YOU HAVE ALL
THE TRUTH, AND YOUR OTHER TRIBE

16:35.227 --> 16:41.233
HAS NONE OF IT; AND YOU HAVE ALL
THE VIRTUE, AND THE OTHER SIDE
HAS NONE OF IT; YOU CAN'T BEHAVE
THAT WAY.

16:41.300 --> 16:49.074
YOU CAN'T MAKE IT WORK.
THIS COUNTRY CAME TO THE POINT
WHERE WE HAD VIOLENCE IN THE
USUAL PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF

16:49.141 --> 17:00.819
POWER.
THAT IS A HUGE WARNING TO HOW
UNSTABLE OUR SYSTEM CAN BE, IF
WE REMAIN TRIBALISTS IN A SYSTEM

17:00.886 --> 17:09.395
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE DESIGNED
FOR REASONABLE CITIZENS.
>> Pelley: YOU KNOW, WE WRING
OUR HANDS ABOUT THE STRIDENT

17:09.461 --> 17:15.300
NATURE OF POLITICS TODAY.
BUT HASN'T IT ALWAYS BEEN THAT
WAY?
>> Sullivan: OH, YEAH.

17:15.367 --> 17:23.909
THERE'S A LOT OF WHAT YOU MIGHT
CALL ROUGH AND TUMBLE, SHARP
RHETORIC.
AND THAT'S HEALTHY.

17:23.976 --> 17:31.250
WHAT'S NOT HEALTHY IS WHEN THAT
ISN'T JUST RETAINED AND KEPT IN
THE POLITICAL AREA, BUT BECOMES
PERSONAL, BECOMES SOMETHING YOU

17:31.316 --> 17:35.354
BRING TO THE SUPERMARKET,
BECOMES SOMETHING YOU BRING TO
THANKSGIVING DINNER, BECOMES
SOMETHING THAT PERMEATES

17:35.421 --> 17:42.961
EVERYTHING.
AND THAT SEPARATION BETWEEN
POLITICS AND LIFE IS WHAT WE'RE
LOSING, AND THAT'S A TERRIBLE

17:43.028 --> 17:51.370
THING TO LOSE.
>> Pelley: ANDREW SULLIVAN, 58,
GREW UP IN EAST GRINSTEAD IN
RURAL, SOUTHERN ENGLAND.

17:51.437 --> 18:00.579
HE WON A SCHOLARSHIP TO OXFORD,
WHICH LED TO HARVARD AND A Ph.D.
IN POLITICAL SCIENCE INSPIRED BY
BRITISH CONSERVATIVE MICHAEL

18:00.646 --> 18:06.752
OAKESHOTT.
>> Sullivan: AND HE DEFINED
CONSERVATISM AS, REALLY, A
DEFENSE OF WHAT<i> IS.</i>

18:06.819 --> 18:15.360
A LOVE OF WHAT YOU ALREADY HAVE,
AND FEAR THAT IT COULD ALL
DISAPPEAR.
A SENSE OF THE FRAGILITY OF THE

18:15.427 --> 18:23.001
WORLD, AND THE IMPORTANCE OF
BEING PRAGMATIC.
NOT HAVING SOME IDEOLOGICAL
ABSTRACTION YOU WANT TO FORCE

18:23.068 --> 18:30.642
ONTO REALITY, BUT UNDERSTANDING
REALITY AS SOMETHING THAT CAN
GIVE YOU OCCASIONS FOR CHANGE,
WHICH WE DO NEED.

18:30.709 --> 18:38.250
BUT ALSO WARNINGS FOR EXCESSIVE
CHANGE AND EXCESSIVE RADICALISM.
>> Pelley: IN 2006, YOU WROTE A
BOOK CALLED "THE CONSERVATIVE

18:38.317 --> 18:43.856
SOUL."
WHAT WERE YOU SAYING?
>> Sullivan: I WAS SAYING THAT
CONSERVATISM HAD LOST ITS WAY.

18:43.922 --> 18:51.396
BECAUSE IT HAD BECOME TOO SURE
OF ITSELF.
IT WAS FULL OF HUBRIS.
IT BELIEVED IT HAD THE ANSWER,

18:51.463 --> 19:02.674
THE TRUTH; BECAME INTOLERANT OF
LIBERALS AND OF LIBERALISM, AND
IT BECAME HARDENED BY RELIGIOUS
FUNDAMENTALISM, WHICH BROOKS NO

19:02.741 --> 19:11.416
COMPROMISE, EITHER.
SO, IT BROKE THE CONSERVATIVE
VIRTUES OF HUMILITY, SKEPTICISM,
DOUBT.

19:11.483 --> 19:20.726
>> Pelley: IN THE BOOK, YOU TALK
ABOUT RESCUING CONSERVATISM.
HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT THAT?
>> Sullivan: YOU WAIT FOR THESE

19:20.792 --> 19:26.999
TERRIBLE PASSIONS AND THE
CURRENT CULT-WORSHIP OF A HUMAN-
- INDIVIDUAL HUMAN BEING, DONALD
TRUMP.

19:27.065 --> 19:35.407
YOU WAIT AND HOPE THAT WILL
PASS, SO THAT WE CAN GET BACK TO
THE PRAGMATIC PROCESS OF
GOVERNING REALITY.

19:35.474 --> 19:41.246
AND THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE
ENGAGED IN NOW.
WE'RE FLYING FROM REALITY.
WE'RE INVENTING ABSTRACTIONS AND

19:41.313 --> 19:51.323
IDEOLOGIES.
WE'RE FIGHTING EACH OTHER.
WE'RE DEMONIZING EACH OTHER.
THE SYSTEM CAN STILL WORK.

19:51.390 --> 19:59.831
IT'S WE WHO ARE BROKEN.
>> Pelley: THE IDEAS OF
TOLERANCE, REASON, AND DEBATE
CAME TO SULLIVAN EARLY IN LIFE,

19:59.898 --> 20:08.974
WHEN HE REALIZED HE WAS
CONSERVATIVE, CATHOLIC, AND GAY.
YOU HAVE WRITTEN THAT YOU FIRST
ACKNOWLEDGED BEING GAY WHILE

20:09.041 --> 20:19.151
TAKING COMMUNION.
>> Sullivan: YEAH.
I ALWAYS, AS A KID, HAD AN
INTENSE SPIRITUALITY.

20:19.217 --> 20:27.459
AND, AS IT WELLED UP IN ME THAT
I WASN'T LIKE OTHER BOYS, THE
ONLY PERSON I THOUGHT I COULD
TAKE IT TO WAS GOD.

20:27.526 --> 20:34.399
SO, HE WAS THE FIRST PERSON I
CAME OUT TO.
JUST, "PLEASE, GOD," I DIDN'T
EVEN HAVE THE WORD FOR IT.

20:34.466 --> 20:42.908
BUT JUST, "HELP ME WITH THAT."
THAT'S WHY, WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME,
YOU KNOW, "HOW CAN YOU BE OPENLY
GAY AND CATHOLIC?", MY RESPONSE

20:42.975 --> 20:49.781
<u>'M</u>
IS, "I'M OPENLY GAY<i> BECAUSE</i>
A CATHOLIC.
BECAUSE I KNOW GOD LOVES ME.

20:49.848 --> 20:58.457
AND I KNOW THAT GOD WOULD WANT
ME TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT
MYSELF.
>> Pelley: IS THAT DICHOTOMY,

20:58.523 --> 21:05.063
CATHOLICISM AND HOMOSEXUALITY,
THE REASON THAT YOU CAN HOLD TWO
COMPETING IDEAS IN YOUR HEAD AT
THE SAME TIME?

21:05.130 --> 21:12.671
>> Sullivan: WELL, I THINK IT
HELPS.
ONE THING ABOUT COMING OUT EARLY
AND BEING HONEST ABOUT THAT, IS

21:12.738 --> 21:18.877
THAT SEEKING TRUTH AND CLARITY
BECOMES A HABIT, AND YOU GET A
LIBERATION FROM THAT.
SO, I SAID THE TRUTH, I THOUGHT

21:18.944 --> 21:24.149
THE WORST WOULD HAPPEN, AND I'M
OKAY.
SO WHY CAN'T I TELL THE TRUTH
ABOUT OTHER THINGS, OR WHY CAN'T

21:24.216 --> 21:31.523
I JUST FERRET IT OUT?
>> Pelley: ANDREW SULLIVAN BEGAN
"SEEKING TRUTH" IN AMERICA IN
1986.

21:31.590 --> 21:39.297
HE NEEDED A JOB, AND THE LEFT-
LEANING "NEW REPUBLIC" MAGAZINE
OFFERED HIM AN INTERNSHIP.
IN FIVE YEARS, HE WAS THE

21:39.364 --> 21:47.906
EDITOR.
SULLIVAN WAS IN A HURRY, BECAUSE
HE EXPECTED TO DIE.
HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH H.I.V. IN

21:47.973 --> 21:55.847
1993.
>> Sullivan: THE THING ABOUT
THAT EXPERIENCE WAS THAT, AS YOU
TOOK CARE OF PEOPLE YOU LOVED,

21:55.914 --> 22:04.456
WHO WERE DYING VERY YOUNG IN--
AND THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE FORGET--
IN REALLY HORRIBLE
CIRCUMSTANCES-- MEDIEVAL

22:04.523 --> 22:13.065
TORTURES: BLINDNESS, SORES,
LESIONS, NEUROPATHY.
THE HUMILIATION OF IT.
AND YOU KNOW, AS I WAS DOING

22:13.131 --> 22:19.171
THAT, THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE
ME.
THAT'S WHY I WROTE THE BOOK
"VIRTUALLY NORMAL: THE CASE FOR

22:19.237 --> 22:25.944
GAY MARRIAGE," BECAUSE I THOUGHT
I ONLY HAD A FEW YEARS LEFT.
AND IF I WANTED TO CONTRIBUTE
SOMETHING, I WOULD TRY AND NAIL

22:26.011 --> 22:33.418
DOWN THE IRONCLAD ARGUMENT FOR
MARRIAGE EQUALITY BEFORE I DIED.
>> Pelley: BUT YOUR ARGUMENT AT
THE TIME WAS THAT SAME-SEX

22:33.485 --> 22:38.657
MARRIAGE SHOULD BE A
CONSERVATIVE GOAL.
>> Sullivan: WELL, IT SHOULD BE,
SHOULDN'T IT?

22:38.724 --> 22:46.131
WHY WOULD SUPPORTING GAY MEN IN
RELATIONSHIPS NOT BE
CONSERVATIVE?
WHY WOULD HELPING FOSTER

22:46.198 --> 22:53.438
RESPONSIBILITY TO TAKE CARE OF
EACH OTHER NOT BE CONSERVATIVE?
OF COURSE, THESE ARE
CONSERVATIVE VALUES.

22:53.505 --> 23:04.416
>> Pelley: SULLIVAN MARRIED HIS
HUSBAND, AARON TONE, IN 2007.
THERE HAVE BEEN SIX BOOKS,
INCLUDING "I WAS WRONG," A

23:04.483 --> 23:13.425
COMPILATION OF HIS FULL-THROATED
CAMPAIGN FOR WAR IN IRAQ WHICH
HE NOW REGRETS.
RECENTLY, IN HIS BLOG, THE

23:13.492 --> 23:22.701
WEEKLY DISH, AND ON HIS PODCAST,
SULLIVAN'S WEIGHED IN ON BLACK
LIVES MATTER AND ON CRITICAL
RACE THEORY, WHICH SAYS RACISM

23:22.768 --> 23:29.374
IS SYSTEMIC AND PERPETUATES
INEQUALITY TO THIS DAY.
>> Sullivan: HERE'S WHAT I THINK
IS GOOD ABOUT IT.

23:29.441 --> 23:38.450
I THINK WE SHOULD BE ABSOLUTELY
VIGILANT ABOUT POLICE ABUSE.
AND WE'VE SEEN IT.
WE'VE PROVEN IT TO BE RACIALLY

23:38.517 --> 23:47.159
TARGETED IN SOME PLACES-- NOT
ALL PLACES.
I THINK WE'VE ALSO TOO OFTEN
WHITEWASHED OUR PAST;

23:47.225 --> 24:00.005
WHITEWASHED THE TRUE HORRORS OF
WHAT IT WAS TO LIVE IN THE
SEGREGATED GULAGS OF THE SOUTH
DURING SLAVERY.

24:00.071 --> 24:11.216
IN ANOTHER SENSE, HOWEVER, ONE
OF ITS KEY ARGUMENTS IS THAT THE
OPPRESSION OF NON-WHITE PEOPLE
IS THE TRUE, CORE MEANING OF

24:11.283 --> 24:18.390
THIS COUNTRY.
NOW, I THINK IT'S ONE IMPORTANT
PART TO UNDERSTAND THIS COUNTRY,
BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S THE MOST

24:18.456 --> 24:24.296
IMPORTANT PART.
AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT'S AN
ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF AMERICA
TODAY.

24:24.362 --> 24:30.168
I DO THINK WE'VE MADE ENORMOUS
STRIDES.
I DO THINK OUR RACIAL PANORAMA
IS MUCH MORE COMPLEX AND DYNAMIC

24:30.235 --> 24:38.043
THAN IT USED TO BE.
AND I DON'T BELIEVE THIS
COUNTRY'S FUNDAMENTALLY EVIL AND
NEEDS TO BE DISMANTLED.

24:38.109 --> 24:45.984
>> Pelley: ANOTHER CONTROVERSY
ABOUT RACE HAS FOLLOWED SULLIVAN
FOR NEARLY 30 YEARS.
BACK IN 1994, AS EDITOR OF THE

24:46.051 --> 24:54.259
"NEW REPUBLIC," HE RAN AN
EXCERPT OF THE BOOK, "THE BELL
CURVE," WHICH IMPLIED AFRICAN
AMERICANS, GENETICALLY, HAVE

24:54.326 --> 25:04.402
LOWER I.Q.s.
THE EXCERPT RAN 10,000 WORDS.
SULLIVAN PRINTED REBUTTALS THAT
RAN 19,000 WORDS.

25:04.469 --> 25:10.508
BUT, HE'S CRITICIZED FOR AIRING
THE DEBATE AT ALL.
SCHOLARS HAVE SINCE DISCREDITED
THE BOOK.

25:10.575 --> 25:18.650
SULLIVAN HAS DEFENDED IT.
YOU HAVE WRITTEN THAT THE BOOK
HAS "HELD UP," THAT THE BOOK WAS
"BRILLIANT."

25:18.717 --> 25:23.321
>> Sullivan: THE DATA IS STILL
THERE.
WE DON'T KNOW.
AND I THINK IT'S BEEN UNFAIRLY

25:23.388 --> 25:31.329
PRESENTED.
THE BOOK IS AGNOSTIC ABOUT THE
MIX OF GENES AND ENVIRONMENT IN
TERMS OF INTELLIGENCE.

25:31.396 --> 25:38.970
AND THAT GOES FOR EVERYONE.
WE DON'T KNOW.
>> Pelley: BUT THIS RAISES A
QUESTION IN THE VIEWER'S MIND:

25:39.037 --> 25:46.144
DOES HE BELIEVE THAT AFRICAN
AMERICANS ARE INHERENTLY LESS
INTELLIGENT THAN WHITE PEOPLE?
>> Sullivan: ABSOLUTELY NOT.

25:46.211 --> 25:51.383
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE FOR THAT.
>> Pelley: WHY WAS THIS AN
IMPORTANT DEBATE TO HAVE?
>> Sullivan: THAT'S A VERY GOOD

25:51.449 --> 25:58.556
POINT, SCOTT.
I'M NOT SURE WE SHOULD, TO BE
HONEST WITH YOU.
THE DEBATE WAS GOING TO HAPPEN,

25:58.623 --> 26:07.232
REGARDLESS.
AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
HELPFUL TO HAVE IT PUT OUT, IN--
IN ALL ITS FORM; BOTH THE CASE

26:07.299 --> 26:11.636
FOR, AND THEN ALL THE CASES
AGAINST.
I THOUGHT THAT WAS A RESPONSIBLE
WAY TO RESPOND TO THE EMERGENCE

26:11.703 --> 26:20.512
OF THIS BOOK AND THIS PIECE.
AND I MAY HAVE MADE THE WRONG
CALL, BUT I DID IT-- I DID IT IN
GOOD FAITH, AND I DID IT BECAUSE

26:20.578 --> 26:28.453
I THINK IT IS ALWAYS BETTER TO
AIR THIS STUFF THAN TO SUPPRESS
IT, HOWEVER FEELINGS MAY BE
HARMED.

26:28.520 --> 26:33.758
BUT I THINK IF I WERE PRESENTED
WITH THAT THING TODAY, I
WOULDN'T.
I'LL BE PERFECTLY HONEST WITH

26:33.825 --> 26:38.930
YOU, I WOULD'T.
I THINK THE HARM OUTWEIGHS THE
GOOD.
>> Pelley: HE DOESN'T MEAN HE'S

26:38.997 --> 26:48.473
GIVING UP ON DEBATE.
HE TOLD US, TOO MANY NEWSROOMS
THESE DAYS PANDER TO THE LEFT
AND RIGHT, AND ARE INTIMIDATED

26:48.540 --> 26:54.079
BY POLITICAL CORRECTNESS.
>> Sullivan: WHEN I RAN THE "NEW
REPUBLIC," IT WAS A CONSTANT
INTERNAL WAR.

26:54.145 --> 26:58.249
PEOPLE FELT PASSIONATE ABOUT
SUBJECTS.
ONE WOULD WRITE ONE WEEK IN ONE
POSITION.

26:58.316 --> 27:03.321
ANOTHER ONE WOULD WRITE THE NEXT
WEEK AGAINST IT.
AND PEOPLE WOULD BE FASCINATED
BY THIS INTERNAL STRUGGLE.

27:03.388 --> 27:11.296
I LOVE THAT.
I HATE THIS FEELING I'M READING
THE CHURCH ENCYCLICAL EVERY WEEK
OR EVERY DAY, AND IT'S TELLING

27:11.363 --> 27:16.835
ME HOW I NEED TO BE PERFECTLY
WOKE OR HOW I NEED TO BE
PERFECTLY "TRUMPY."
LIBERAL DEMOCRACY IS BETTER

27:16.901 --> 27:24.576
DEFENDED IF IT RESTS ON FORMAL
CIVIC MORAL EQUALITY.
>> Pelley: IF THE STAKES FOR
AMERICA SEEM PERSONAL IN

27:24.642 --> 27:34.519
SULLIVAN, IT HELPS TO KNOW HE
HAD TO FIGHT TO BE AMERICAN.
FOR 22 YEARS, THE U.S. BANNED
CITIZENSHIP TO THOSE WITH H.I.V.

27:34.586 --> 27:44.662
HE ARGUED AGAINST THE BAN, WHICH
WAS LIFTED IN 2010.
PROOF AGAIN, HE SAYS, OF WHAT
CAN COME OF PATIENCE AND REASON.

27:44.729 --> 27:51.369
>> Sullivan: WE CAN FIGHT OVER
ARGUMENTS, BUT NOT DEBATE EACH
OTHER'S GOOD FAITH OR CHARACTER,
OR DISMISS PEOPLE BECAUSE OF

27:51.436 --> 27:59.577
THEIR RACE OR SEX OR WHATEVER.
WE CAN LEAVE ALL THAT BEHIND AND
BE CITIZENS, ARGUING, REASONING.
"DELIBERATION" IS WHAT THE

27:59.644 --> 28:08.186
FOUNDERS CALLED IT.
IF WE'RE NOT LIKE THAT, THIS
SYSTEM WILL FAIL, AS IT IS
ALREADY FAILING.

28:08.253 --> 28:16.227
>> Pelley: SO, WHAT GIVES YOU
HOPE?
>> Sullivan: WELL, I WOULD SAY
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

28:16.294 --> 28:23.368
OPTIMISM AND HOPE.
I'M NOT PARTICULARLY OPTIMISTIC,
GIVEN THE TRENDS THAT WE'RE
SEEING.

28:23.435 --> 28:29.340
BUT HOPE'S DIFFERENT.
HOPE IS A SENSE THAT GRACE CAN
HAPPEN.
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S AROUND THE

28:29.407 --> 28:37.782
CORNER.
MAYBE THERE'LL BE SOMETHING IN
THE FUTURE-- A LEADER, A FIGURE,
OR THERE MUST BE A SORT OF

28:37.849 --> 28:44.089
GROUNDSWELL OF PEOPLE, SAYING,
ENOUGH OF THIS.
ENOUGH OF THIS.
THE NOISE, THE RAGE, IT'S

28:44.155 --> 28:49.194
DEAFENING, AND WE'RE BETTER THAN
THIS.

1969, AND THE BEATLES ARE
UNRECOGNIZABLE FROM THE WIDE-

29:05.577 --> 29:10.715
EYED MOP-TOPS WHO APPEARED ON
THE "ED SULLIVAN SHOW" JUST FIVE
YEARS PRIOR.
THEIR POPULARITY IS UNRIVALLED.

29:10.782 --> 29:19.290
THEY'VE STOPPED TOURING, AND
FAME IS EXACTING ITS PRICE.
NOW COMES A SELF-IMPOSED STRESS:
THEY'VE GIVEN THEMSELVES THREE

29:19.357 --> 29:25.530
WEEKS TO RECORD 14 SONGS THAT
THEY'LL PLAY TO A LIVE AUDIENCE,
ALL THE WHILE TRAILED BY
CAMERAS.

29:25.597 --> 29:32.070
THE ASTONISHINGLY INTIMATE
FOOTAGE WAS RECENTLY EXTRACTED
FROM A LONDON VAULT AND PLACED
IN THE CAPABLE HANDS OF

29:32.137 --> 29:38.576
FILMMAKER PETER JACKSON.
HIS RESULTING THREE-PART
DOCUMENTARY SERIES, "GET BACK,"
DROPS THANKSGIVING WEEKEND ON

30:25.623 --> 30:29.794
FASCINATING.
AND AFTER 50 YEARS, YOU'D HAVE
EVERY RIGHT TO BELIEVE THAT
EVERYTHING WITH THE BEATLES HAD

30:29.861 --> 30:34.566

EVERY BIT OF FILM HAD BEEN SEEN,
EVERY BIT OF MUSIC HAD BEEN

YEARS HANGING OUT WITH JOHN,

>> Wertheim: SO, GIVE US SOME
HISTORICAL CONTEXT HERE.

UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES WAS
THIS FOOTAGE SHOT?
>> Jackson: THEY'VE LOST WHAT
THEY LOVED AS TEENAGERS.

31:24.515 --> 31:30.555
THEY'VE LOST BEING THE FOUR GUYS
PLAYING IN A BAND.
SO, THEY'RE GOING TO RECORD A
NEW ALBUM WITH SONGS THAT ONLY--

31:30.622 --> 31:33.891
THAT THEY'RE ONLY GOING TO PLAY
LIVE.
AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO ANY

31:33.958 --> 31:38.496
THERE'S GOING TO BE NO
MULTITRACKING.

31:44.502 --> 31:50.708

WILL MAKE IT NOT CORNY, IS IF WE

SO IT'S-- "I'M IN LOVE FOR THE
FIRST TIME."

32:02.120 --> 32:07.091
>> Wertheim: THE MONTHS'-WORTH
OF FILMING YIELDED ONLY THE
FORGETTABLE 80-MINUTE
DOCUMENTARY, "LET IT BE,"

32:07.158 --> 32:17.702
RELEASED A YEAR LATER, AFTER THE
BEATLES BROKE UP.
A LIFELONG BEATLES FAN, PETER
JACKSON HAD ALWAYS WONDERED,

32:17.769 --> 32:24.275
WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO ALL THOSE
HOURS OF UNSEEN FOOTAGE?
>> Jonathan Clyde: SO, HERE WE
ARE IN VAULT NUMBER THREE.

32:24.342 --> 32:30.048
>> Wertheim: HIS TOLKIEN-LIKE
QUEST TOOK HIM DEEP UNDER THE
LONDON HEADQUARTERS OF APPLE
CORPS, THE BEATLES' LABEL.

32:30.114 --> 32:36.187
>> Jackson: THEY JUST SAID,
"WE'VE GOT IT ALL.
WE'VE GOT 57 HOURS OF FOOTAGE.
WE'VE GOT 130 HOURS OF AUDIO."

32:36.254 --> 32:43.061
AND THEN THEY SAID THAT THEY
WERE THINKING ABOUT MAKING A
DOCUMENTARY USING THE FOOTAGE.
I JUST PUT UP MY HAND AND SAID,

32:43.127 --> 32:49.901
"WELL, IF-- IF YOU ARE LOOKING
FOR SOMEBODY TO MAKE IT?
DON'T-- PLEASE JUST-- THINK--
THINK OF ME."

32:49.967 --> 32:56.674
>> Wertheim: BACK IN NEW
ZEALAND, JACKSON BEGAN THE
ULTIMATE BINGE-WATCH, SCREENING
THIS MUSICAL MOTHER LODE, FRAME

32:56.741 --> 33:05.683
BY FRAME.
GIVEN THAT ANY BEATLES FAN WILL
TELL YOU THAT "LET IT BE" COMES
SHROUDED IN SADNESS-- FOREVER

33:05.750 --> 33:12.490
ASSOCIATED WITH THE GREAT
DIVORCE IN ROCK AND ROLL
HISTORY-- JACKSON BRACED FOR THE
GLOOMY WORST.

33:12.557 --> 33:18.229
>> Jackson: I WAS WATCHING, I
WAS WAITING FOR IT TO GET BAD.
I WAS WAITING FOR THE NARRATIVE
THAT I'D BELIEVED OVER THE YEARS

33:18.296 --> 33:23.334
TO START HAPPENING.
I WAS WAITING FOR THE ARGUMENTS.
WAITING FOR THE DISCONTENT.
WAITING FOR THE MISERY.

33:23.401 --> 33:27.872
AND, YOU KNOW, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.
I MEAN, IT SHOWS-- YOU KNOW, IT
SHOWS ISSUES.
IT SHOWS PROBLEMS.

33:27.939 --> 33:33.177
BUT-- BUT ANY BAND, ANY TIME,
HAS THO-- HAS THOSE-- HAS THOSE
PROBLEMS.
THIS IS NOT A BAND THAT'S

33:33.244 --> 33:37.682
BREAKING UP.
THESE ARE NOT GUYS THAT DISLIKE
EACH OTHER.
THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M-- WHAT--

33:37.749 --> 33:44.021
WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE.
THAT'S NOT WHAT WAS BEING
FILMED.

33:46.124 --> 33:50.595
>> John Lennon: YEAH, BUT THE
WAY I WAS PLAYING IT, IT WAS
STARTING ON F.
>> Wertheim: HERE'S WHAT<i> WAS</i>

33:50.661 --> 33:58.436
BEING FILMED: THE FOUR
LIVERPUDLIANS IN THEIR LATE 20s,
WORKING COLLABORATIVELY,
SURROUNDED BY A STRIKINGLY

33:58.503 --> 34:08.346
SMALL, TIGHT ENTOURAGE.
THERE'S LINDA-- LINDA EASTMAN,
AT THE TIME-- TAKING PHOTOS.
AND, OF COURSE, YOKO ONO.

34:08.413 --> 34:14.318
AS LONG AS WE'RE HERE, LET'S
DISPENSE NOW WITH THAT FAMOUS
BIT OF BEATLES BREAK-UP
MYTHOLOGY.

34:14.385 --> 34:21.092
THE CASUAL FAN LOOKING FOR "YOKO
ONO BROKE UP THE BEATLES"
MIGHT COME AWAY FROM THIS
DISAPPOINTED, I SUSPECT.

34:21.159 --> 34:26.831
>> Giles Martin: YEAH, I THINK
THAT'S A GOOD THING, YOU KNOW.
I MEAN, YOKO DIDN'T BREAK UP THE
BEATLES.

34:26.898 --> 34:30.268
AND-- AND NO ONE THING BROKE UP
THE BEATLES.
>> George Martin: THAT'S THE
ORIGINAL.

34:30.334 --> 34:34.405
>> Giles Martin: THAT'S THE
ORIGINAL.
>> Wertheim: GILES MARTIN IS THE
SON OF LATE BEATLES PRODUCER

34:34.472 --> 34:41.212
GEORGE MARTIN.
GILES GREW UP IN THE BEATLES
ORBIT, AND HAS SINCE REMIXED
MOST OF THE BAND'S ALBUMS.

34:41.279 --> 34:48.453
WHEN PETER JACKSON ENLISTED HIM
FOR THIS SERIES, MARTIN PLOWED
THROUGH ALL THE HUNDREDS OF
HOURS OF AUDIO AND VIDEO.

34:48.519 --> 34:54.992
>> Giles Martin: YOU CAN SEE THE
CRACKS APPEARING.
THE ONE THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE
IS THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHY

34:55.059 --> 34:59.797
THEY WERE GETTING TIRED OF EACH
OTHER.
BECAUSE YOU GET THE SENSE OF
WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE IN A ROOM

34:59.864 --> 35:06.437
WITH THEM, WHICH IS SUCH A
PRIVILEGE FOR ALL OF US.
>> Wertheim: DESPITE THOSE
CRACKS, THE BEATLES ALCHEMY

35:06.504 --> 35:15.746
REMAINS POTENT.
>> Jackson: AT ONE POINT, WE
HAVE FOOTAGE OF PAUL McCARTNEY
SORT OF STRUMMING ON-- ON HIS

35:15.813 --> 35:22.253
BASS, WHICH HE USES AS A GUITAR
HALF THE TIME.
JUST SORT OF STRUMMING.
I THINK IT'S EARLY IN THE

35:22.320 --> 35:30.895
MORNING, AND THEY'RE WAITING FOR
JOHN TO-- HASN'T ARRIVED YET.
HE'S JUST BIDING SOME TIME.
HE SLOWLY FINDS THE TUNE.

35:30.962 --> 35:37.468
♪("GET BACK")

35:39.403 --> 35:43.941
>> Jackson: AND SO, YOU SEE THIS
SONG KIND OF JUST BE PLUCKED OUT
OF THIN AIR.
>> McCartney: LEFT HIS HOME IN

35:44.008 --> 35:48.546
TUCSON, ARIZONA.
>> Lennon: IS TUCSON IN ARIZONA?
>> McCartney: YEAH.
IT'S WHERE THEY MAKE "HIGH

35:48.613 --> 35:53.584
CHAPARRAL."
LIKE, I CAN MAKE SENSE OF IT.
JOJO LEFT HIS HOME, HOPING IT
WOULD BE A BLAST, PRETTY SOON HE

35:53.651 --> 35:59.657
FOUND THAT HE'D HAVE TO BE A
LONER WITH SOME CALIFORNIA
GRASS.
AND NOW YOU THINK, OKAY, THAT

35:59.724 --> 36:06.397
MAKES SENSE, BUT IT DOESN'T SING
GOOD.
>> Wertheim: THE BEATLES HAD
ALWAYS BEEN FURIOUSLY

36:06.464 --> 36:17.008
PRODUCTIVE, BUT THIS WAS THE
CREATIVE PROCESS IN DOUBLE TIME:
14 SONGS IN 22 DAYS.
WAS THAT AS MUCH AN ABSURD TIME

36:17.074 --> 36:22.280
PRESSURE IN 1969 AS IT WOULD
APPEAR TO BE TODAY?
>> Giles Martin: YEAH.
THIS IS THE BIGGEST BAND ON THE

36:22.346 --> 36:27.451
PLANET, SAYING WE'RE GOING TO
DO-- WE'RE GOING TO DO OUR FIRST
SHOW IN THREE YEARS, IN THREE
WEEKS' TIME.

36:27.518 --> 36:33.124
BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S
GOING TO BE, AND WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT SONGS WE'RE GOING TO PLAY.
>> Wertheim: AS YOU LISTEN TO

36:33.190 --> 36:39.897
ALL THE RECORDINGS FOR THIS
PROJECT, WHAT IMPRESSIONS DID
YOU ARRIVE AT, IN TERMS OF THEIR
CHEMISTRY?

36:39.964 --> 36:47.338
>> Giles Martin: MY IMPRESSION
OF IT IS THAT PAUL AND JOHN KIND
OF KNEW THAT THEY WERE GROWING
APART, AND "LET IT BE" WAS

36:47.405 --> 36:54.378
ALMOST LIKE A MARRIAGE THAT'S
FAILING, AND THEY WANT TO GO
BACK ON THEIR DATE NIGHTS AGAIN.

36:55.746 --> 37:02.486
>> Wertheim: COMPOUNDING
MATTERS, GEORGE HARRISON--
RESTLESS IN HIS ROLE AND
BRISTLING UNDER PAUL McCARTNEY'S

37:02.553 --> 37:07.658
DRIVING AMBITION-- LEAVES THE
BAND AFTER A WEEK.
>> Jackson: IT'S THE MOST LOW-
KEY WALK-OUT THAT YOU'VE EVER

37:07.725 --> 37:12.697
SEEN IN YOUR LIFE.
IT'S JUST-- "I'M LEAVING NOW."
"WHAT?"
"I'M LEAVING THE BAND NOW."

37:12.763 --> 37:17.702
AND THEN HE GOES.
THERE'S NO FIGHT, THERE'S NO
ARGUMENT, THERE'S NO
DISAGREEMENT.

37:17.768 --> 37:24.809
>> Wertheim: JOHN WAS IN LOVE
WITH YOKO AND, IN HIS WORDS, HE
WAS MISTREATING HIS BODY.
THE BAND WAS COMPETING FOR HIS

37:24.875 --> 37:30.481
ATTENTION-- NOT ALWAYS
SUCCESSFULLY.
>> Lennon: WHEN I WAS YOUNGER,
MUCH YOUNGER THAN TODAY, I NEVER

37:30.548 --> 37:39.757
NEEDED ANYBODY'S HELP IN ANY
WAY.
BUT NOW MY LIFE HAS CHANGED IN
OH-SO-MANY WAYS, A WOP-BOP-

37:39.824 --> 37:46.998
ALOOMA, A-WOP-BAM-BOO.
>> McCartney: WE CAN'T CARRY ON
LIKE THIS INDEFINITELY.
>> Lennon: WE SEEM TO BE.

37:47.064 --> 37:54.572
>> McCartney: WE SEEM TO, BUT WE
CAN'T.
SEE, WHAT YOU NEED IS A SERIOUS
PROGRAM OF WORK, NOT AN AIMLESS

37:54.639 --> 38:01.579
RAMBLING AMONGST THE CANYONS OF
YOUR MIND.
>> Wertheim: PAUL HAD,
GRUDGINGLY, BECOME THE BAND'S

38:01.646 --> 38:08.252
HALL MONITOR, MORE LEAD THAN
SINGER.
GEORGE WAS PERSUADED TO COME
BACK, BUT WITH THE LIVE

38:08.319 --> 38:15.259
PERFORMANCE APPROACHING, THE
BEATLES DECIDED THEY NEEDED A
CHANGE OF SCENERY.
THEY RELOCATED TO A MAKESHIFT

38:15.326 --> 38:21.732
STUDIO IN THE BASEMENT OF APPLE
RECORDS.
>> Lennon: I DIG A PYGMY BY
CHARLES HAWTREY AND THE DEAF

38:21.799 --> 38:28.839
AIDS.
PHASE ONE, IN WHICH DORIS GETS
HER OATS.

38:30.374 --> 38:37.181
>> Wertheim: A SURGE OF FRESH
ENERGY ALSO CAME IN THE FORM OF
A KEYBOARD PLAYER: BILLY
PRESTON, A 22-YEAR-OLD TEXAN

COMES IN AND THEY JUST HAD TO
SUDDENLY IMPROVE THEIR PLAYING,

39:07.378 --> 39:13.551
BECAUSE THEY HAD THIS FORCE OF
NATURE IN THE ROOM WITH THEM.
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT HE DID.
I THINK HE WORKED AS A CATALYST

39:13.617 --> 39:22.927

BUT PETER JACKSON'S "GET BACK"

39:31.268 --> 39:38.109
SERIES DOESN'T JUST RESTORE LOST
FOOTAGE, OR THE BEATLES' MUSIC;
IT RESTORES SOMETHING MUCH
DEEPER.
