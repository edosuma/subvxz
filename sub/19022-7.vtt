WEBVTT

00:00.434 --> 00:02.013
Previously on "Six"...

00:02.016 --> 00:04.131
The target is Nilofar Kazbekov.

00:04.134 --> 00:06.293
Agency sources tell us
she may have information

00:06.296 --> 00:07.885
leading to Rip in West Africa.

00:07.888 --> 00:09.574
Got the computer.

00:09.577 --> 00:11.597
Are you prepared for the next phase?

00:11.600 --> 00:13.075
I'm going to get the SEAL.

00:13.078 --> 00:14.551
Not without approval.

00:14.554 --> 00:16.763
He's a distraction from your mission.

00:19.308 --> 00:20.728
This is unexpected.

00:20.731 --> 00:22.149
Our alliance with Boko Haram

00:22.152 --> 00:24.389
is the key to our expansion into Africa.

00:24.392 --> 00:25.345
Of course, but I...

00:25.348 --> 00:27.993
So then why do you go and you
kill their leader and his men?

00:27.996 --> 00:31.191
I made a tactical decision.
It wasn't safe to conta...

00:31.194 --> 00:32.983
You stole my trust.

00:32.986 --> 00:36.485
Your best option is to
trade me and those girls

00:36.488 --> 00:38.857
for 20 of your imprisoned
Jihadist brothers.

00:38.860 --> 00:41.409
Give your boy to Boko Haram.

00:41.412 --> 00:43.072
Meet your new cellmate.

00:45.648 --> 00:47.117
Hello.

00:47.118 --> 00:50.407
He said that a SEAL killed
a prisoner in cold blood.

00:50.408 --> 00:52.457
This guy has Rip or knows who has him.

00:52.458 --> 00:53.661
Can't send it to Intel,

00:53.664 --> 00:55.787
because they they'll know what
Rip said in the video is true.

00:55.788 --> 00:57.827
It'd be the word of a
terrorist against us.

00:57.828 --> 00:59.068
This is bigger than Rip.

00:59.071 --> 01:01.117
It's bigger than the girls,
and it's bigger than us.

01:01.118 --> 01:02.962
He wants to be the next Osama Bin Laden.

01:33.144 --> 01:35.683
Hey.

01:35.684 --> 01:38.563
I need some, too.

01:38.564 --> 01:40.684
Say "please."

01:46.474 --> 01:47.804
Please.

02:13.684 --> 02:16.143
Say "thank you."

02:16.144 --> 02:19.103
This is a misunderstanding.
I'll be out of here soon.

02:19.104 --> 02:21.853
You'd be better off
keeping your mouth shut.

02:21.854 --> 02:24.013
I don't know. Dad looked
pretty disappointed in you.

02:24.014 --> 02:25.224
He's not my father.

02:25.225 --> 02:26.896
No, no, no, no, no.

02:26.899 --> 02:28.603
He's the Butcher of Khost.

02:28.604 --> 02:32.393
Insha'allah, he kills one
more before the end of the day.

02:32.394 --> 02:35.014
Well, I'd be careful of
that, 'cause it might be you.

02:39.514 --> 02:41.763
You're a long way away from Detroit.

02:41.764 --> 02:43.223
Go to hell.

02:43.224 --> 02:45.473
Dearborn, right?

02:45.474 --> 02:48.643
Where the Muslims live.

02:48.644 --> 02:50.803
Most of them don't betray their country.

02:50.804 --> 02:52.683
You wanna talk about betrayal?

02:52.684 --> 02:56.226
My father was an engineer in Lebanon.

02:56.229 --> 02:57.973
He was respected.

02:57.974 --> 03:02.393
In America, he worked two jobs
at minimum wage for 40 years.

03:02.394 --> 03:04.643
Slave labor.

03:04.644 --> 03:08.264
He paid his taxes, he
voted, and for what?

03:09.974 --> 03:14.803
If you don't have ...loads of
money in America, you're nobody.

03:14.804 --> 03:17.303
You're trash.

03:17.304 --> 03:19.063
America betrayed us.

03:19.064 --> 03:21.973
Yeah, you and 50 million other people.

03:21.974 --> 03:24.853
But I guess you're special, right?

03:24.854 --> 03:27.013
You think you're owed something.

03:27.014 --> 03:29.893
How can you do what you do?

03:29.894 --> 03:34.723
The Koran does not condone
the killing of innocent people.

03:34.724 --> 03:38.523
The cross is dipped in far more blood

03:38.526 --> 03:40.066
than the crescent moon.

03:43.564 --> 03:47.513
You are worse than Boko Haram.

03:47.514 --> 03:51.063
They are just thugs.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.473
You?

03:53.474 --> 03:56.514
You couch your murders in pretty words.

03:56.517 --> 03:59.910
You use God to justify your barbarity.

04:02.604 --> 04:04.684
We all think God is on our side.

04:10.347 --> 04:11.766
Did you watch the video?

04:11.769 --> 04:13.724
- I watched it.
- We have a translation.

04:13.727 --> 04:16.908
I speak Pashto, Caulder.
He says Rip did it.

04:16.911 --> 04:17.624
Did he?

04:17.627 --> 04:19.764
Dude's a terrorist.
Nobody's gonna believe him.

04:19.767 --> 04:23.063
But you do, or you
wouldn't be asking me to...

04:23.064 --> 04:24.763
to do what, exactly?

04:24.764 --> 04:26.513
He must have Rip.

04:26.514 --> 04:28.263
He might even have the Nigerian girls.

04:28.264 --> 04:30.353
We have to get this into
the intelligence community

04:30.354 --> 04:32.393
and figure out who he
is so we can get them.

04:32.394 --> 04:34.966
Without our fingerprints?

04:34.969 --> 04:36.872
I know it's a big favor to ask.

04:36.875 --> 04:38.933
Do you realize how much
trouble we could be in?

04:38.934 --> 04:41.103
What I should do is give it to NCIS.

04:41.104 --> 04:43.303
Let them decide if it's true or not.

04:43.304 --> 04:44.974
We think the guy in
the video's American.

04:47.644 --> 04:50.143
What happens if he comes back, huh?

04:50.144 --> 04:52.103
What happens if he's
not on a watch list?

04:52.104 --> 04:53.973
What happens if he kills more people?

04:53.974 --> 04:55.519
Who gave you this video?

04:55.520 --> 04:57.063
Give it to NCIS.

04:57.064 --> 05:00.103
Do whatever you think is right,

05:00.104 --> 05:01.643
after we get him back,

05:01.644 --> 05:04.144
after we get those girls
back to their families.

05:48.434 --> 05:49.802
Anything?

05:49.805 --> 05:51.473
Fung still hasn't gotten back to me,

05:51.474 --> 05:53.013
so either we're going after Rip,

05:53.014 --> 05:55.763
or the NCIS dickheads come knocking,

05:55.764 --> 05:57.353
and we may end up in Leavenworth.

05:57.354 --> 05:59.563
So this is it.

05:59.564 --> 06:01.433
We get Rip or we throw away our careers.

06:01.434 --> 06:03.853
Yeah. This is it.

06:03.854 --> 06:05.563
Nice.

06:05.564 --> 06:07.564
And I just got here.

06:12.264 --> 06:15.513
That line you told me
about between good and evil,

06:15.514 --> 06:17.513
remind me which side we're on again.

06:17.514 --> 06:21.183
Things aren't as simple as
that. You told me that, remember?

06:21.184 --> 06:24.513
Jesus, Bear. Rule number
one... Never take my advice.

06:26.974 --> 06:28.264
That's right.

06:46.974 --> 06:49.143
Where'd you go to school?

06:49.144 --> 06:50.563
What do you care?

06:50.564 --> 06:52.933
You're a college boy.

06:52.934 --> 06:56.303
I can tell.

06:56.304 --> 06:59.893
Bet you own a scholarship.

06:59.894 --> 07:02.563
Doctor.

07:02.564 --> 07:04.013
Or lawyer.

07:04.014 --> 07:07.433
I dropped out of Michigan...

07:07.434 --> 07:10.433
after my father was beaten
half to death for being Muslim,

07:10.434 --> 07:11.495
by men like you.

07:11.498 --> 07:14.803
Well, white trash like me
don't get to go to college.

07:14.804 --> 07:17.643
Either jail or the
military for people like me.

07:17.644 --> 07:19.810
Yeah, it's your country.

07:19.813 --> 07:22.600
You know, my old man...

07:22.603 --> 07:25.663
He got drunk one night,

07:25.666 --> 07:28.375
went to town on me with a metal pipe.

07:28.378 --> 07:31.013
Broke my arm, lacerated my kidney.

07:31.014 --> 07:33.143
So I chose door number two,

07:33.144 --> 07:35.564
'cause I wanted to be the
baddest dude on the planet.

07:37.172 --> 07:41.051
That son of a bitch was
never gonna hit me again.

07:41.052 --> 07:42.722
I became a SEAL.

07:44.379 --> 07:47.418
I started negotiations for you.

07:47.421 --> 07:50.234
Farouk Mohammad and 20
Jihadists out of Guantanamo.

07:52.741 --> 07:55.359
Boko Haram doesn't want our
money. They want your head.

07:55.362 --> 07:57.301
You wanted to sacrifice
yourself for the cause.

07:57.302 --> 07:59.511
This is your chance.

07:59.512 --> 08:00.677
The girls come with me.

08:00.678 --> 08:01.841
No.

08:01.842 --> 08:03.841
Our Muslims brothers need wives.

08:03.844 --> 08:05.761
They'll go back to Boko Haram with you.

08:05.762 --> 08:07.471
No. Please. Please, you can't do that.

08:07.472 --> 08:09.801
We are not going back
there! We are not going back!

08:09.802 --> 08:12.091
There is no deal without
them, 'cause I won't go.

08:12.092 --> 08:13.882
You don't have a choice now, do you?

08:17.932 --> 08:20.051
Akmal, look at me.

08:20.052 --> 08:22.645
Akmal.

08:22.762 --> 08:24.261
Akmal!

08:44.047 --> 08:45.454
Thanks.

09:08.886 --> 09:11.006
All I know is death.

09:13.796 --> 09:17.846
Everything I see,
everything I... touch...

09:20.096 --> 09:21.596
I destroy.

09:31.556 --> 09:33.136
Just go.

09:44.676 --> 09:46.885
Joe?

09:46.886 --> 09:49.256
I don't think we should have a child.

10:22.506 --> 10:23.631
Hello?

10:23.632 --> 10:24.755
Hey, Dharma.

10:24.756 --> 10:25.926
How are you?

10:25.927 --> 10:27.095
Hey, I was wondering if maybe

10:27.096 --> 10:28.756
you wanted to grab coffee
or lunch or something

10:28.758 --> 10:31.505
- so we can...
- How am I? I'm not really here.

10:31.506 --> 10:34.175
I'm in the air, in the ocean.

10:34.176 --> 10:35.845
I'm everywhere and nowhere.

10:35.846 --> 10:37.425
Don't bother to leave a message.

10:37.426 --> 10:39.465
I won't return your call. Beeeeep.

10:43.016 --> 10:43.976
Give it back to me!

10:43.979 --> 10:44.937
Hold on!

10:44.940 --> 10:45.878
It's mine.

10:45.881 --> 10:48.426
Anabel, just give him the shell.

10:48.429 --> 10:49.796
- Anabel, I hate you!
- Hey!

10:49.799 --> 10:50.622
- It's your fault!
- Hey, come on.

10:50.624 --> 10:51.871
- That's enough.
- You did it!

10:51.874 --> 10:53.363
Hey, come on, guys. Chill.

10:53.366 --> 10:55.463
Who wants some ice
cream, huh? Well, sorbet.

10:55.466 --> 10:56.744
Oh, no, no. I have to get back.

10:56.747 --> 10:59.215
I have that dinner tonight.
It's an important client, Ricky.

10:59.216 --> 11:02.055
Yeah, of course. Huh,
you're gonna get it, right?

11:02.056 --> 11:04.903
We're gonna be fine. Huh?
We got this, right, guys?

11:04.906 --> 11:06.055
Mm-hmm.

11:06.056 --> 11:07.715
Hey.

11:07.716 --> 11:09.095
Hey.

11:09.096 --> 11:13.055
What's up? Que pasa, juanita? Huh?

11:13.056 --> 11:16.255
I'm just gonna say it.

11:16.256 --> 11:18.505
I don't wanna go to dance school.

11:18.506 --> 11:21.095
What?

11:21.096 --> 11:24.555
What do you mean? This has
been your dream, like, forever.

11:24.556 --> 11:25.944
It's been your dream.

11:25.947 --> 11:27.282
Oh, you're going to that school.

11:27.285 --> 11:29.055
No, I'm not.

11:29.056 --> 11:31.498
It's not fun anymore. I
want to be with my friends.

11:31.501 --> 11:33.555
Your father is leaving
the Service so you can go.

11:33.556 --> 11:35.675
I took the job to pay
for it. You're going.

11:35.676 --> 11:37.135
I'm not going.

11:37.136 --> 11:38.675
- Anabel!
- Well...

11:44.613 --> 11:46.822
You have to be back before
I leave for this dinner.

11:46.825 --> 11:48.425
I don't know what time I'll be back.

11:48.426 --> 11:49.511
Ricky...

11:49.512 --> 11:50.596
It's about Rip.

12:12.683 --> 12:14.201
At ease.

12:14.202 --> 12:16.491
I think you all know Ms. Houlding,

12:16.492 --> 12:18.741
the National Security Advisor.

12:18.742 --> 12:21.201
Jim Beauchamp, White House Counsel.

12:21.202 --> 12:24.201
Boys, we caught a break.

12:24.202 --> 12:29.031
We think we know who
has Rip and the girls.

12:29.032 --> 12:32.331
We just stumbled on reliable
intel that leads us to this man...

12:32.332 --> 12:34.411
Michael Nasry.

12:34.412 --> 12:37.621
Born in Dearborn, Michigan,
dropped out of U of M.

12:37.622 --> 12:40.911
Same flag from the
Tanzania and Dubai bombings

12:40.912 --> 12:43.291
is behind Rip in the confession video.

12:43.292 --> 12:45.201
Sir, are we any closer to a location?

12:45.202 --> 12:48.411
The computer you snatched
from Nilofar in Panama

12:48.412 --> 12:50.911
puts her brother in an
abandoned Soviet cement plant

12:50.912 --> 12:52.241
in Southern Chad.

12:52.242 --> 12:53.661
They got sloppy.

12:53.662 --> 12:56.201
We picked up low-level voice intercept

12:56.202 --> 12:58.121
about an American hostage.

12:58.122 --> 13:00.451
So there's a very good chance

13:00.452 --> 13:03.451
that Nasry is at this
location with Taggart.

13:03.452 --> 13:06.701
Sir, is this the same
group that killed Buck?

13:06.702 --> 13:08.951
Looks like it.

13:08.952 --> 13:10.492
Ma'am.

13:12.702 --> 13:15.911
The White House is quietly
negotiating Taggart's release.

13:15.912 --> 13:18.713
The girls, too, if they're there.

13:18.716 --> 13:22.385
We're hoping to avoid another
military adventure in West Africa,

13:22.386 --> 13:25.135
but if negotiations don't work,

13:25.136 --> 13:27.595
you go in and you bring them back.

13:27.596 --> 13:30.135
Ma'am, what about Nasry?

13:30.136 --> 13:31.927
We just gonna let him
go for Rip's exchange?

13:31.930 --> 13:34.095
The minute those hostages are safe,

13:34.096 --> 13:37.175
we incinerate the...

13:37.176 --> 13:41.095
White Squadron is wheels up, two hours.

13:41.096 --> 13:42.885
Tidy up your home life.

13:51.176 --> 13:52.596
Hey.

13:55.096 --> 13:58.215
Take Buck's saw on this op, all right?

13:58.216 --> 14:00.096
Roger that.

14:15.256 --> 14:18.247
Is it true?

14:18.250 --> 14:22.465
Are we really going back
there, with those men?

14:22.466 --> 14:24.005
You're coming with me.

14:24.006 --> 14:26.019
Don't lie to her, Richard.

14:26.022 --> 14:27.942
There's nothing you can do.

14:34.426 --> 14:36.256
You're the recruiter, right?

14:38.205 --> 14:39.455
The man with the golden tongue?

14:41.506 --> 14:44.345
Recruit Akmal.

14:44.346 --> 14:46.795
To do what?

14:46.796 --> 14:48.216
To kill your boss.

14:49.846 --> 14:52.675
Your brother died for that man.

14:52.676 --> 14:55.755
That's what you said, right?

14:55.756 --> 14:57.596
This is how he repays loyalty?

15:04.056 --> 15:07.255
How can you sit there

15:07.256 --> 15:10.505
and do nothing?

15:10.506 --> 15:12.676
Does your life really
mean that little to you?

15:14.739 --> 15:18.029
What do you know about
the value of a human life?

15:24.556 --> 15:26.256
You're a coward.

15:48.636 --> 15:51.715
The exchange for Rip is in two days.

15:51.716 --> 15:54.715
A Ranger element will
provide cordon force security

15:54.716 --> 15:56.675
in case the exchange falls through

15:56.676 --> 15:58.135
and we have to go in.

15:58.136 --> 16:00.675
One Troop will be the QRF.

16:00.676 --> 16:03.005
Now as soon as Rip is safe,

16:03.006 --> 16:05.381
either through the exchange
or we go in and get him,

16:05.384 --> 16:07.215
we'll have our JTAC's
disappear the place

16:07.216 --> 16:09.965
with a couple of 2,000-pounders.

16:09.966 --> 16:11.006
What about the girls, sir?

16:11.009 --> 16:13.425
ISR and our birds are
blocked by the concrete roofs,

16:13.426 --> 16:15.175
so we don't have eyes on 'em.

16:15.176 --> 16:16.595
So they might not even be there.

16:16.596 --> 16:19.425
That's what we have to find out.

16:19.426 --> 16:21.715
They have food but no water,

16:21.716 --> 16:24.229
which is delivered every
other day by a Nigerian,

16:24.232 --> 16:26.425
a local Baggara Arab who looks Libyan,

16:26.426 --> 16:27.965
and another local grunt.

16:27.966 --> 16:29.795
We've identified the route they take.

16:35.136 --> 16:38.311
Salaam Alaikum.

16:49.176 --> 16:51.505
Hands! Down!

16:51.506 --> 16:53.795
Out. Come on! Down! Down! Down!

16:53.796 --> 16:55.380
We got two minutes.

16:55.383 --> 16:56.583
Clean that blood up.

17:11.296 --> 17:12.845
Radio check. Radio check.

17:16.175 --> 17:17.795
QRF will launch if it goes sideways.

17:17.796 --> 17:19.596
- Yeah, to pick up the pieces.
- Ah.

17:19.598 --> 17:21.595
Chase, you good?

17:21.596 --> 17:24.296
Yeah.

17:41.676 --> 17:43.505
Should be me going in there.

17:43.506 --> 17:46.505
Yeah. You'd fit right in.

18:02.484 --> 18:03.864
Akmal?

18:04.151 --> 18:06.277
_

18:06.984 --> 18:09.019
_

18:09.022 --> 18:10.513
_

18:10.516 --> 18:12.661
_

18:13.266 --> 18:14.936
_

18:15.087 --> 18:17.762
_

18:17.976 --> 18:20.821
_

18:24.841 --> 18:29.526
_

18:29.658 --> 18:30.843
_

18:32.085 --> 18:33.914
_

18:34.141 --> 18:35.960
_

18:36.588 --> 18:39.486
_

18:40.390 --> 18:43.327
_

18:44.160 --> 18:46.314
_

18:57.302 --> 18:59.010
_

19:07.362 --> 19:10.151
_

19:10.154 --> 19:11.824
They'll obey him now.

19:13.817 --> 19:16.934
_

19:16.937 --> 19:20.217
_

19:21.194 --> 19:22.754
He'll kill you, too...

19:23.301 --> 19:25.981
_

19:30.324 --> 19:35.233
Akmal, I can help you, if you help me.

19:35.234 --> 19:36.733
You think Muttaqi would have thought

19:36.734 --> 19:39.573
of getting the SEAL to confess?

19:39.574 --> 19:42.653
You have to convince him to free me.

19:42.654 --> 19:46.073
We are on a new path
to Jihad, you and I.

19:46.074 --> 19:48.283
I saw your face when you recognized

19:48.284 --> 19:50.983
everything we worked
for was coming true.

19:50.984 --> 19:55.573
Muttaqi is stuck in the
past. We're the future.

19:55.574 --> 19:58.733
All you are to him is a strong back,

19:58.734 --> 20:02.823
a slave like the Zanj who rebelled
against the Abbasid Caliphate.

20:02.824 --> 20:06.823
Join me. Be like Ali ibn Muhammad.

20:06.824 --> 20:10.283
You killed your commander once

20:10.284 --> 20:13.153
in the name of Allah.

20:13.154 --> 20:15.283
Do it again...

20:15.284 --> 20:18.324
for our cause, Akmal.

20:20.694 --> 20:23.863
Muttaqi was right.

20:23.864 --> 20:25.574
You have no loyalty.

20:45.364 --> 20:47.573
Richard,

20:47.574 --> 20:50.783
I understood a little of
what they said in Arabic.

20:50.784 --> 20:53.073
Somebody got shot,

20:53.074 --> 20:56.323
some... something about the big guy,

20:56.324 --> 20:58.073
Akmal's sister,

20:58.074 --> 21:01.904
not being able to reach her on a game.

21:03.904 --> 21:05.194
Okay.

21:12.614 --> 21:15.943
Akmal's got a sister?

21:15.944 --> 21:17.784
Is she a terrorist, too?

21:19.734 --> 21:22.653
This game...

21:22.654 --> 21:24.574
This game's a video game, right?

21:26.944 --> 21:30.783
Now you know we know all about that.

21:30.784 --> 21:34.523
That's how you guys communicate, right?

21:34.524 --> 21:36.614
Private chat room.

21:38.234 --> 21:40.693
A bunch of you guys join,

21:40.694 --> 21:44.024
create your own encrypted message board.

21:46.154 --> 21:48.574
You think it's untraceable.

21:50.041 --> 21:51.121
I know it is.

21:51.124 --> 21:53.216
Not if one of your
computers gets snatched.

21:55.324 --> 21:58.573
Maybe Akmal's sister isn't talking

21:58.574 --> 22:00.693
because she's been compromised.

22:00.694 --> 22:02.073
You don't know that.

22:02.074 --> 22:05.523
Well, Akmal seemed to
be worried about it.

22:05.524 --> 22:07.824
I bet Muttaqi would be
worried about it, too.

22:09.734 --> 22:11.443
You're playing a dangerous game.

22:11.444 --> 22:13.613
And what choice do we have?

22:13.614 --> 22:15.523
Come on.

22:15.524 --> 22:17.903
Come on.

22:17.904 --> 22:18.967
What do you want?

22:18.970 --> 22:21.153
I want you to let her go.

22:21.154 --> 22:24.217
I want you to let those girls go.

22:24.220 --> 22:26.705
They deserve a chance to live.

22:26.708 --> 22:29.023
They deserve a chance at a good life.

22:29.024 --> 22:30.359
What do I get?

22:30.360 --> 22:31.693
You get me.

22:44.172 --> 22:45.921
Remember, don't speak.

22:45.922 --> 22:48.252
Limit your eye contact. Think meek.

22:56.483 --> 22:58.273
Fellas, here we go.

23:37.062 --> 23:38.482
_

23:38.482 --> 23:40.010
_

23:40.013 --> 23:42.006
_

23:42.472 --> 23:43.509
_

23:43.512 --> 23:45.882
He's asking who Fishbait is.

23:46.076 --> 23:47.701
_

23:47.704 --> 23:49.069
_

23:52.052 --> 23:53.801
What's he saying?

23:53.802 --> 23:55.961
It's too far away. I can't hear it.

23:55.962 --> 23:58.131
Come on.

23:58.132 --> 23:59.962
Come on, Fish.

24:00.256 --> 24:01.329
_

24:02.107 --> 24:03.588
_

24:03.826 --> 24:05.656
_

24:06.680 --> 24:08.652
_

24:08.655 --> 24:09.945
They could be compromised.

24:09.948 --> 24:11.462
Get the QRF ready now.

24:12.986 --> 24:14.503
_

24:19.038 --> 24:20.628
Look, sir. Look.

24:23.342 --> 24:25.422
All right, belay my last.

24:31.450 --> 24:32.633
What's going on?

24:32.636 --> 24:34.127
Truck camera's failing.

24:36.021 --> 24:38.399
All right, lock on as
many faces as you can.

24:38.402 --> 24:39.512
Yes, sir.

24:39.515 --> 24:41.672
Starting with the guy out front.

24:43.873 --> 24:46.447
_

24:55.809 --> 24:56.867
Got him.

24:56.868 --> 24:58.487
Facial recon has a match on that guy.

24:58.488 --> 25:01.367
Akmal Barayev, former Russian Spetsnaz.

25:01.368 --> 25:03.339
Nilofar's brother.

25:03.342 --> 25:04.822
I guess we knocked on the right door.

25:09.463 --> 25:11.477
_

25:14.353 --> 25:16.596
_

25:19.265 --> 25:20.546
_

25:21.752 --> 25:24.132
I.D. that guy that
just grabbed the water.

25:25.672 --> 25:28.422
Facial recognition's
got a lock on him, sir.

25:31.302 --> 25:33.171
His name is Akhmed...

25:33.172 --> 25:36.091
He's a Chechen.

25:36.092 --> 25:38.961
Wait. Pull up that guy in the suit.

25:38.962 --> 25:40.382
Zoom in.

25:44.632 --> 25:45.842
Holyshit.

25:45.843 --> 25:47.051
Yeah.

25:47.052 --> 25:48.591
Muttaqi's with this guy Michael Nasry.

25:48.592 --> 25:49.842
Lock it up.

25:52.062 --> 25:53.891
We have a confirmation.

25:53.894 --> 25:55.961
Emir Hatim Al-Muttaqi.

25:55.962 --> 25:58.302
All right, push that
to the Joint Chiefs.

26:05.386 --> 26:06.756
Where's he going?

26:13.136 --> 26:15.402
Rewind. What was down that hall?

26:20.028 --> 26:21.738
Whatever it was, we missed it.

26:29.252 --> 26:31.631
Freeze. Zoom in.

26:31.632 --> 26:34.341
Zooming in.

26:34.342 --> 26:36.307
Look at their rifles.

26:36.310 --> 26:38.421
Definitely the same guys
we dumped in the BH village.

26:38.422 --> 26:40.962
- Mm-hmm.
- All right, correlate these images

26:40.965 --> 26:42.737
With the blueprints
and get a head count.

26:42.738 --> 26:44.511
Sir.

27:01.462 --> 27:02.962
_

27:11.152 --> 27:12.641
_

27:12.976 --> 27:14.211
_

27:14.379 --> 27:15.799
_

27:15.802 --> 27:18.711
French?

27:18.712 --> 27:20.172
Harvard.

27:37.512 --> 27:39.091
All stations, Delta Four.

27:39.092 --> 27:41.301
We are egressing from target. Break.

27:41.302 --> 27:43.841
Confirmed eyes on at
least one female hostage.

27:43.842 --> 27:46.801
I say again, one female
hostage is confirmed.

27:46.802 --> 27:48.044
I knew it.

27:48.047 --> 27:50.053
- There's no Rip.
- They must keep them separated.

27:50.055 --> 27:52.342
All right, push that up the chain.

27:55.842 --> 27:57.841
Tell me about your brother.

27:57.842 --> 27:59.212
Why?

28:01.052 --> 28:03.711
Well, I shot him.

28:03.712 --> 28:04.962
I'd like to know.

28:06.922 --> 28:08.421
Do you have a brother?

28:08.422 --> 28:09.756
Yeah.

28:09.759 --> 28:11.587
Younger?

28:11.588 --> 28:13.251
Eight years older.

28:13.252 --> 28:14.712
Did you want to be him?

28:16.632 --> 28:18.961
When I got out from
underneath my father's thumb.

28:18.962 --> 28:21.421
Mm. Omar wanted to be me.

28:21.422 --> 28:23.631
Same school, same major,

28:23.632 --> 28:27.631
same sports, same blonde girls.

28:27.632 --> 28:29.212
The Cause.

28:30.752 --> 28:33.671
You recruited him?

28:33.672 --> 28:35.931
Omar was braver than me, smarter.

28:35.934 --> 28:39.511
He learned Pashto and
Arabic faster than me.

28:39.512 --> 28:42.301
He insisted on the
most dangerous missions.

28:42.302 --> 28:46.961
Muttaqi would send him into
your bases to get intel.

28:46.962 --> 28:49.341
Your people never suspected him.

28:49.342 --> 28:51.302
Can I see his picture?

28:56.342 --> 28:58.592
Show it to me.

29:14.882 --> 29:17.252
If it weren't for me,
he'd still be alive.

29:21.212 --> 29:26.011
We have a saying... in my world...

29:26.012 --> 29:27.882
You can't feed a lion lettuce.

29:30.882 --> 29:32.552
That's what I am.

29:41.092 --> 29:42.512
I'm sorry.

29:53.172 --> 29:55.052
It's what we are.

30:03.302 --> 30:05.142
Hey!

30:05.145 --> 30:08.762
Muttaqi! I got something to say!

30:08.765 --> 30:10.632
I wanna talk to the Butcher of Khost!

30:12.342 --> 30:13.881
Shut up!

30:16.512 --> 30:18.592
- What do you want?
- I want to talk to your boss.

30:18.595 --> 30:20.922
_

30:22.882 --> 30:25.671
Akmal's sister's been taken.

30:25.672 --> 30:27.711
I overheard him.

30:27.712 --> 30:29.712
He tried to reach out to her on a game.

30:32.422 --> 30:36.461
It's true, Akmal. She's not answering.

30:36.462 --> 30:38.921
Your communication's been compromised.

30:38.922 --> 30:40.447
My people smell you, Muttaqi.

30:40.450 --> 30:42.421
They're on their way here right now.

30:42.422 --> 30:43.902
I know what you're trying to do.

30:43.903 --> 30:45.381
Ask him.

30:45.413 --> 30:46.529
Ask him!

30:46.532 --> 30:49.048
_

30:49.750 --> 30:51.360
_

30:52.273 --> 30:53.877
_

30:54.398 --> 30:55.171
_

30:56.364 --> 30:59.924
_

30:59.927 --> 31:02.715
_

31:03.746 --> 31:05.203
_

31:08.012 --> 31:11.341
Justice is coming to you,
Michael, quicker than I thought.

31:25.644 --> 31:28.265
Based on the intel that
Chase and Malouf here gave us,

31:28.267 --> 31:30.973
we believe that the girls
are in the northwest sector.

31:30.974 --> 31:33.353
Now we're still unsure
at to Rip's location,

31:33.354 --> 31:35.903
but we're gonna push
through and press the target

31:35.906 --> 31:37.695
until we find him.

31:37.698 --> 31:40.407
Delta, we're gonna air-land on the X,

31:40.408 --> 31:43.327
move toward our primary entry point.

31:43.328 --> 31:47.027
Chalk Two, with Echo, are
gonna insert on the roof.

31:47.028 --> 31:49.327
Chalk Three, with Bravo,

31:49.328 --> 31:52.027
are gonna insert on the
south side and breach here.

31:52.028 --> 31:53.238
Questions?

31:53.239 --> 31:54.447
What about the Cordon Element?

31:54.448 --> 31:56.472
Rangers are gonna come in and
tighten the noose once we're inside.

31:56.474 --> 31:58.487
Nobody gets in, nobody gets out.

31:58.488 --> 32:00.787
Pack your kit. Keep studying this.

32:00.788 --> 32:03.367
Know your deconfliction
points. All right?

32:03.368 --> 32:05.197
Sir, take a look.

32:05.198 --> 32:07.697
Those four men just came on station.

32:07.698 --> 32:09.327
They posted a guard outside.

32:09.328 --> 32:10.448
All right, give me those.

32:22.328 --> 32:24.407
Delta Eight, this is Delta One.

32:24.408 --> 32:25.827
Do you have eyes on the hostile

32:25.828 --> 32:27.578
on the south side of the target? Over.

32:30.198 --> 32:33.117
Delta One, Roger. He just came out.

32:36.028 --> 32:38.287
Bastard has night vision.

32:38.288 --> 32:40.287
Roger that. Sit tight. Over.

32:42.698 --> 32:44.533
So we have NODs now.

32:44.534 --> 32:46.367
That's a game changer.

32:46.368 --> 32:47.298
They see us on insert,

32:47.301 --> 32:49.582
they kill Rip and the girls
before we even get close, sir.

32:53.796 --> 32:56.367
_

32:56.370 --> 32:57.796
_

32:57.799 --> 32:59.105
_

32:59.468 --> 33:00.564
_

33:00.677 --> 33:01.597
_

33:02.186 --> 33:04.275
_

33:05.129 --> 33:06.638
_

33:06.982 --> 33:08.284
_

33:08.634 --> 33:10.599
_

33:11.096 --> 33:12.876
_

33:12.879 --> 33:15.305
_

33:21.288 --> 33:23.367
- You guys hearing that?
- What?

33:30.238 --> 33:33.867
Metal on metal, voices,
footsteps, a lot of activity.

33:33.868 --> 33:35.367
So what do you make of it?

33:35.368 --> 33:37.077
Something's rattled them.

33:37.078 --> 33:40.027
They're getting ready to move.

33:45.137 --> 33:46.223
_

33:46.519 --> 33:47.858
_

33:48.121 --> 33:49.865
_

33:55.578 --> 33:57.118
Man, check this out.

33:59.658 --> 34:01.327
White phosphor.

34:01.328 --> 34:04.447
These new babies are crisp, man.

34:04.448 --> 34:07.867
All right, listen up. We
just got word from JSOC.

34:07.868 --> 34:10.077
Negotiations for Rip broke down.

34:10.078 --> 34:12.577
SIGINT picked up some
Boko Haram chatter,

34:12.578 --> 34:15.027
and a group based north of Benin City

34:15.027 --> 34:19.697
is sending a truck to rendezvous
near a cement factory in Chad.

34:19.697 --> 34:21.592
Our cement factory?

34:21.594 --> 34:23.487
There's only one in Chad.

34:23.487 --> 34:26.237
Predator's tacking the truck,
and they're two hours out.

34:26.237 --> 34:28.697
The President pulled the trigger.

34:28.697 --> 34:31.368
H-Hour is 0600, local time.

34:33.118 --> 34:34.023
First light.

34:34.025 --> 34:35.987
You want to get Rip and those girls,

34:35.991 --> 34:37.658
It's first light.

34:39.447 --> 34:41.117
Sir.

34:41.118 --> 34:44.286
Okay, everyone, we leave at 0600.

34:44.288 --> 34:46.788
Another daytime hit.

34:52.237 --> 34:56.288
You need to know why Rip
wanted you to take the team.

34:58.618 --> 35:00.617
He knew I had a family.

35:00.618 --> 35:03.287
He knew I cared about them as
much as I care about the team.

35:03.288 --> 35:06.527
He thought it would weigh on me.

35:06.528 --> 35:07.948
He was right.

35:12.118 --> 35:15.737
Still remember the
quote he burned into me.

35:15.738 --> 35:17.907
"Out of every 100 men,

35:17.908 --> 35:20.787
10 shouldn't be in combat,
80 are just targets,

35:20.788 --> 35:24.367
9 are real fighters,

35:24.368 --> 35:27.907
but one...

35:27.908 --> 35:30.027
one is a warrior,

35:30.028 --> 35:32.158
and he will bring the others back."

35:33.948 --> 35:36.327
You are the one, Joe.

35:36.328 --> 35:38.027
You will bring us home.

35:38.028 --> 35:41.368
You will bring Rip and those girls back.

35:43.288 --> 35:45.447
That's why you're team leader, brother.

37:30.140 --> 37:32.743
Time to load the birds.

37:34.914 --> 37:37.623
Get those girls out, find Rip,

37:37.624 --> 37:40.583
then we'll sink some
J-dams into that structure

37:40.584 --> 37:41.769
wipe it off the map.

37:42.954 --> 37:45.413
And, Joe, I don't care

37:45.414 --> 37:48.373
what really happened
with Rip in Afghanistan.

37:48.374 --> 37:49.833
You just bring him home.

37:49.834 --> 37:51.164
Yes, sir.

38:15.454 --> 38:19.043
What do I tell the girls?

38:19.044 --> 38:21.663
Esther?

38:21.664 --> 38:25.099
If you get a chance to run, you take it.

38:25.102 --> 38:27.203
If you can save just
one of those girls...

38:32.164 --> 38:34.283
It's time.

38:39.164 --> 38:41.083
Richard?

38:41.084 --> 38:43.123
Where's Muttaqi?

38:43.124 --> 38:45.874
You are dead to him already.

38:49.291 --> 38:50.561
Teacher? Mr. Rip?

38:51.835 --> 38:53.125
Let's go.

39:10.124 --> 39:11.783
Ugh!

40:03.164 --> 40:05.624
Don't do this.

40:06.704 --> 40:08.084
Akmal!

40:11.784 --> 40:13.994
You will serve Allah now, Michael.

40:14.198 --> 40:16.553
_

40:17.151 --> 40:19.628
_

40:21.864 --> 40:22.948
He'll kill you now.
