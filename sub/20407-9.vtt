00:00.841 --> 00:02.609
Previously, on <i>Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:03.701 --> 00:04.901
In the profitability
challenge...

00:04.968 --> 00:06.736
Okay

00:06.804 --> 00:08.004
The Chefs faced off to determine

00:08.071 --> 00:09.005
who had the best
meat dishes.

00:09.073 --> 00:11.140
I like it.
Lentils got plenty of flavor.

00:11.208 --> 00:13.009
And it all came down
to Sabrina,

00:13.077 --> 00:15.078
clearly, the red team's
most controversial member...

00:15.145 --> 00:17.447
She has no experience.
We're just sick of carrying her.

00:17.514 --> 00:20.316
Who surprised everyone
or her team.

00:22.019 --> 00:23.219
I said I wasn't gonna cry.

00:23.287 --> 00:24.987
But when you're this happy,

00:25.055 --> 00:26.055
like, it's okay.

00:26.123 --> 00:27.290
Aah!

00:27.358 --> 00:28.458
Then...

00:28.525 --> 00:29.792
<i>Out the front door, quickly!</i>

00:29.860 --> 00:31.127
Just before dinner,

00:31.195 --> 00:32.427
Chef Ramsey announced
an important milestone.

00:32.496 --> 00:33.496
Tonight, Hell's Kitchen
is gonna be open

00:33.564 --> 00:35.331
for its 100th dinner service.

00:35.399 --> 00:37.367
And among the many
v.I.P.S attending

00:37.434 --> 00:40.336
were past
<i>Hell's Kitchen</i> winners.

00:40.404 --> 00:42.372
You can be part
of that elite group.

00:42.439 --> 00:44.607
They are my inspiration.

00:44.675 --> 00:47.210
Chef Ramsey's expectations
were at an all-time high.

00:47.277 --> 00:48.945
<i>My customers</i>
<i>deserve the best!</i>

00:49.012 --> 00:51.114
This is a bit night
on a lot of scales.

00:51.181 --> 00:52.915
In the red kitchen,
Nona on the appetizers...

00:52.983 --> 00:54.150
Delicious.

00:54.218 --> 00:55.752
And Jillian on fish...

00:55.819 --> 00:56.419
<i>That lobster's</i>
<i>perfectly cooked.</i>

00:56.487 --> 00:57.587
Thank you, Chef!

00:57.654 --> 00:59.856
Rose to the occasion.

00:59.923 --> 01:02.125
But Trev was a disaster
on garnish.

01:02.192 --> 01:03.359
Wake up!

01:03.427 --> 01:04.894
Oh, my God.

01:04.962 --> 01:06.696
In the blue kitchen...

01:06.764 --> 01:07.997
<i>Hey, don't do this to me</i>
<i>tonight!</i>

01:08.065 --> 01:09.365
Boris sank on appetizers.

01:09.433 --> 01:11.601
Agh! Stop panicking,
just focus!

01:11.668 --> 01:13.035
And Vinny on fish...

01:13.103 --> 01:15.905
All three of them,
chewy.

01:15.973 --> 01:17.740
You forgot
the Chicken!

01:17.808 --> 01:19.275
Had their worst
performances yet.

01:19.343 --> 01:21.444
Get out!
Get out of here.

01:21.512 --> 01:24.781
Get out! Out!

01:24.848 --> 01:26.983
The red team had
an excellent dinner service.

01:27.050 --> 01:28.251
Ladies, well done.
Clearly you won tonight.

01:28.318 --> 01:29.452
Despite...

01:29.520 --> 01:32.288
Trevor, absolute disastrous.

01:32.356 --> 01:34.090
And the blue team
had to nominate two people

01:34.158 --> 01:35.425
for elimination.

01:35.492 --> 01:37.427
First nominee tonight,
Chef, is Boris.

01:37.494 --> 01:39.262
But they couldn't even do that.

01:39.329 --> 01:40.830
It's tied between
me and Vinny.

01:40.898 --> 01:42.432
<i>You can't even come together</i>

01:42.499 --> 01:43.599
<i>with a simple decision.</i>

01:43.667 --> 01:45.601
<i>Vinny, Rob, Boris.</i>

01:45.669 --> 01:47.637
Step forward!

01:47.704 --> 01:49.472
Chef Ramsey quickly
made his decision.

01:49.540 --> 01:51.073
Boris, give me your jacket.

01:51.141 --> 01:53.142
And the catering Chef
from New Jersey

01:53.210 --> 01:58.080
became the eighth person
to go home.

01:58.148 --> 01:59.315
But Chef Ramsey...

01:59.383 --> 02:00.716
I'm not finished yet.

02:00.784 --> 02:01.851
Shocked everyone

02:01.919 --> 02:03.052
by calling up
one more Chef.

02:03.120 --> 02:05.521
Trev, get your ass up here.

02:05.589 --> 02:08.390
Find out what happens to Trev,

03:18.428 --> 03:20.263
After nearly ruining Hell's Kitchen's

03:20.330 --> 03:22.265
100th dinner service.

03:22.332 --> 03:23.866
Big man, give me your jacket.

03:23.934 --> 03:24.700
Boris is sent home.

03:24.768 --> 03:26.068
Good luck, guys.

03:26.136 --> 03:27.370
But Chef Ramsey...

03:27.437 --> 03:29.438
I'm not finished yet.

03:29.506 --> 03:31.541
Feels someone else needs
to be held accountable.

03:31.608 --> 03:33.609
Trev.

03:33.677 --> 03:34.510
Get your ass up here.

03:38.815 --> 03:41.751
Let me tell you something
really important.

03:41.818 --> 03:42.885
The girls

03:42.953 --> 03:45.288
<i>had a solid service.</i>

03:45.355 --> 03:48.090
You fell apart.

03:48.158 --> 03:49.992
Take your jacket off!

03:54.998 --> 03:58.568
'Cause you're going
back in the men's team.

04:00.604 --> 04:01.771
<i>Hey, big boy.</i>

04:01.838 --> 04:03.539
Yes, Chef?
<i>Last chance.</i>

04:03.607 --> 04:05.541
You dodged the bullet tonight.

04:05.609 --> 04:07.076
I'm not gonna tolerate one more
service like that from you.

04:07.144 --> 04:08.678
Yes, Chef.

04:08.745 --> 04:10.413
<i>The battle of the sexes</i>
<i>is alive again.</i>

04:10.480 --> 04:12.515
Guys, Off
out of here.

04:12.583 --> 04:13.849
<i>Ladies, good night.</i>

04:13.917 --> 04:15.151
Good night, Chef.

04:15.218 --> 04:15.885
<i>Holy .</i>

04:18.288 --> 04:20.055
Bye, Trevor.

04:20.123 --> 04:21.591
Go back to your little boys,

04:21.658 --> 04:24.894
'cause you know
what they're gonna do.

04:24.962 --> 04:27.029
Where you belong.
Peace out.

04:28.465 --> 04:30.900
Those chicks let me hang out
to Dry.

04:30.968 --> 04:32.668
I don't feel that the red team
had my back

04:32.736 --> 04:34.203
as much as I've had theirs.

04:34.271 --> 04:36.539
But here I am,
back with the boys.

04:36.607 --> 04:38.975
And I can honestly say
I'm glad to be back.

04:39.042 --> 04:40.943
<i>I'm so glad he got</i>
<i>put back on that team.</i>

04:41.011 --> 04:42.612
He was pissing me off.

04:42.679 --> 04:45.581
Seriously. God, he was such
a crybaby, dude.

04:45.649 --> 04:47.216
All I did was try
and help 'em,

04:47.284 --> 04:47.984
and I hope they crash
and burn.

04:48.051 --> 04:49.051
I really do.

04:49.119 --> 04:51.020
Got me good tonight.

04:51.088 --> 04:53.122
I can't believe
I let that happen.

05:00.831 --> 05:02.598
The teams are back
to men versus women.

05:04.368 --> 05:07.036
And while the women's morale
is at an all-time high,

05:07.104 --> 05:08.938
the men are looking
to bounce back.

05:09.006 --> 05:10.239
Morning, morning.

05:10.307 --> 05:11.107
Good morning, Chef.

05:11.174 --> 05:12.308
<i>Okay...</i>

05:12.376 --> 05:13.843
Have a good
look around, yes?

05:13.910 --> 05:15.311
The field's been cut
in half, yeah?

05:15.379 --> 05:16.579
<i>One of you will become</i>
<i>the head Chef</i>

05:16.647 --> 05:18.881
of the la market.

05:18.949 --> 05:20.182
<i>Now...</i>

05:20.250 --> 05:22.284
La market is on
the main floor

05:22.352 --> 05:24.186
of the brand-new
JW Marriott.

05:24.254 --> 05:27.523
You are gonna see some of
the most famous faces

05:27.591 --> 05:29.525
from across the world
staying there.

05:29.593 --> 05:32.261
And the kitchen is also
responsible for

05:32.329 --> 05:33.396
room service.

05:33.463 --> 05:34.430
<i>Yes, Chef.</i>

05:34.498 --> 05:35.564
Yeah?

05:35.632 --> 05:37.333
Scott.

05:37.401 --> 05:39.135
<i>I brought</i>
<i>in room service items.</i>

05:39.202 --> 05:41.871
<i>Staples across</i>
<i>any five-star hotel.</i>

05:41.938 --> 05:43.339
Yes?
Yes, Chef.

05:43.407 --> 05:44.974
Now, I'm interested
in your opinions, yeah?

05:45.042 --> 05:46.008
Yes, Chef.
Yes, Chef.

05:46.076 --> 05:47.576
So have a little taste.

05:47.644 --> 05:49.178
Chef Ramsey has hand-picked

05:49.246 --> 05:50.613
four unique dishes
for the Chefs to taste.

05:50.681 --> 05:52.415
A little taste.
Pass 'em round.

05:52.482 --> 05:53.683
But what the Chefs don't know

05:53.750 --> 05:55.317
is that only one
of these dishes

05:55.385 --> 05:56.752
is actually
from a five-star hotel's

05:56.820 --> 05:57.753
room service menu.

05:59.356 --> 06:02.224
The others, well, they're
not exactly fine dining.

06:04.327 --> 06:05.695
That chicken salad sandwich...

06:05.762 --> 06:07.063
Those two, please.

06:07.130 --> 06:08.064
Is from a gas station.

06:08.131 --> 06:09.365
Nice.

06:09.433 --> 06:10.633
That spaghetti marinara...

06:10.701 --> 06:11.801
Thank you very much.

06:11.868 --> 06:12.668
Is from a food truck.

06:14.037 --> 06:15.337
And the egg rolls...

06:15.405 --> 06:16.672
Thank you
very much indeed.

06:16.740 --> 06:17.873
Are chinese delivery.

06:17.941 --> 06:19.809
The only dish from an actual

06:19.876 --> 06:22.344
five-star room service menu
is the chicken wings.

06:22.412 --> 06:24.547
Did you guys have a wing?
Yes, Chef.

06:24.614 --> 06:26.115
And they're from Chef Ramsay's
restaurant,

06:26.183 --> 06:27.650
the London West Hollywood.

06:27.718 --> 06:28.718
Now, Sabrina,

06:28.785 --> 06:30.019
which one was your favorite?

06:30.087 --> 06:32.054
This one.
The roll.

06:32.122 --> 06:33.689
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>
<i>The rolls.</i>

06:33.757 --> 06:35.257
<i>I really liked</i>
<i>the dipping sauce.</i>

06:35.325 --> 06:36.258
This had a ginger--
it was good.

06:36.326 --> 06:37.960
I liked it.
<i>Yeah? Nona.</i>

06:38.028 --> 06:39.628
I thought the chicken sandwich
was actually the best.

06:39.696 --> 06:40.129
<i>The mixture was nice.</i>

06:41.965 --> 06:43.532
<i>Rob.</i>
I was a fan of the wings.

06:43.600 --> 06:44.667
<i>You're a fan of the wings!</i>

06:44.735 --> 06:45.968
<i>Good.</i>

06:46.036 --> 06:49.505
So I've learned
a lot about you from this.

06:49.573 --> 06:51.240
The biggest thing I've learnt
about you

06:51.308 --> 06:53.309
is that your palates
need work!

06:55.712 --> 06:56.979
<i>Let me tell you why.</i>

06:57.047 --> 06:59.415
Every dish except for one

06:59.483 --> 07:00.783
<i>on this trolley</i>

07:00.851 --> 07:03.285
is from a fast food
restaurant.

07:03.353 --> 07:04.653
Ohh.

07:04.721 --> 07:06.355
I knew there was some kind
of trick to this.

07:06.423 --> 07:07.823
There's always
some kind of trick

07:07.891 --> 07:09.258
or twist
with Chef Ramsey.

07:09.326 --> 07:10.726
The chicken sandwich,
for instance,

07:10.794 --> 07:12.194
that, Nona, you preferred.

07:12.262 --> 07:13.629
That is from a gas station!

07:13.697 --> 07:15.965
!

07:16.032 --> 07:18.968
Well, it was pretty good
for a gas station sandwich.

07:19.035 --> 07:20.469
The egg rolls...

07:20.537 --> 07:23.072
That's from
a chinese take-away.

07:23.140 --> 07:25.841
I am literally stunned.

07:25.909 --> 07:27.176
The wings.

07:27.244 --> 07:28.911
These are actually
from a hotel.

07:28.979 --> 07:29.979
My hotel.

07:30.046 --> 07:31.447
Rob, well done.

07:31.515 --> 07:34.517
That was the only dish.

07:34.584 --> 07:37.153
I didn't care for the wings.

07:37.220 --> 07:38.387
Shh.

07:38.455 --> 07:39.922
<i>The truth</i>
<i>of the matter is</i>

07:39.990 --> 07:41.457
<i>that your palate</i>

07:41.525 --> 07:44.560
is in need of desperate work.

07:44.628 --> 07:46.695
Which brings me
to our next challenge.

07:46.763 --> 07:47.696
The blind taste test.

07:47.764 --> 07:48.998
Yeah!

07:49.065 --> 07:50.266
Let's go.

07:50.333 --> 07:51.901
Chef Ramsey believes

07:51.968 --> 07:53.369
that great cooking techniques
can be taught,

07:53.436 --> 07:55.304
but a finely-tuned palate
is something a Chef

07:55.372 --> 07:57.306
has to be blessed with.

07:57.374 --> 07:59.875
That is why the blind taste test
is the perfect indicator

07:59.943 --> 08:01.677
a Chef's true potential.

08:01.745 --> 08:03.345
Let's start with
Russell and Gail.

08:03.413 --> 08:05.080
<i>Let's go, Rusty.</i>

08:05.148 --> 08:06.248
Each Chef must
attempt to identify

08:06.316 --> 08:07.349
four items.

08:07.417 --> 08:09.251
The team with the most
correct answers

08:09.319 --> 08:10.186
will win the challenge.

08:10.253 --> 08:11.921
Right. Number one.

08:11.988 --> 08:13.789
Grapefruit.

08:13.857 --> 08:15.691
Blue is on a losing streak
hard right now.

08:15.759 --> 08:17.359
We lost the past two
challenges.

08:17.427 --> 08:19.128
We really wanna win this.

08:19.196 --> 08:20.663
We want this one
really, really bad.

08:20.730 --> 08:21.730
What was that?

08:21.798 --> 08:22.932
Grapefruit.

08:24.167 --> 08:25.868
What was that?
Grapefruit.

08:25.936 --> 08:27.236
<i>Well done.</i>

08:27.304 --> 08:28.537
Yes! We're off
to a good start.

08:28.605 --> 08:29.905
Let's go, come on.

08:29.973 --> 08:31.640
Number two, sea bass.

08:33.210 --> 08:35.711
Mmm, easy.
What is that?

08:35.779 --> 08:37.546
Crab.

08:37.614 --> 08:38.714
<i>What is that?</i>

08:38.782 --> 08:39.948
Salmon?

08:41.051 --> 08:42.818
Sea bass.

08:42.885 --> 08:44.920
Sea bass.

08:44.988 --> 08:49.625
Dummy.

08:49.693 --> 08:51.126
<i>Mmm.</i>

08:51.194 --> 08:52.461
What is that?

08:52.529 --> 08:53.662
Romaine.

08:53.730 --> 08:55.331
Ohh!

08:55.398 --> 08:57.666
Iceberg.

08:57.734 --> 08:58.834
What was that?
Romaine?

08:59.903 --> 09:01.170
Ohh.

09:01.238 --> 09:02.872
Okay, it's all right.
We're tied.

09:02.939 --> 09:04.306
I'm okay
with being tied right now.

09:04.374 --> 09:05.441
As long as if they get a point,
we have to get a point.

09:05.508 --> 09:06.675
Black truffle.

09:11.681 --> 09:13.249
What is that?

09:14.885 --> 09:16.185
Truffles?

09:16.253 --> 09:17.419
Nice.

09:17.487 --> 09:18.354
There you go.
<i>Well done.</i>

09:18.421 --> 09:19.521
What is that?

09:22.792 --> 09:23.993
Watercress?

09:24.060 --> 09:25.227
Ohh.

09:25.295 --> 09:26.862
Watercress?

09:26.930 --> 09:28.097
<i>Oh, wow.</i>

09:28.164 --> 09:29.265
Black truffle.

09:29.332 --> 09:30.799
Oh, ho ho.
Damn it!

09:30.867 --> 09:32.701
It's really much harder
than it looks.

09:32.769 --> 09:34.503
<i>Okay, two one.</i>

09:34.571 --> 09:36.272
, Sabrina.

09:36.339 --> 09:37.973
<i>Rob, let's go, big boy.</i>

09:38.041 --> 09:39.475
<i>Go, Sabrina!</i>
<i>Come on, robby!</i>

09:39.542 --> 09:41.243
<i>Whoo!</i>
<i>Get 'em, big boy!</i>

09:41.311 --> 09:43.145
Oh, this is gonna be
a complete lay-up, you know?

09:43.213 --> 09:44.980
I've had a lot of flavors
in my time.

09:45.048 --> 09:46.148
I think I'm gonna
be okay on this one.

09:46.216 --> 09:47.383
Here we go.

09:50.620 --> 09:52.354
Come on, Rob.
What is that?

09:52.422 --> 09:53.589
Bok choy.

09:53.657 --> 09:54.556
Ohh.

09:54.624 --> 09:55.758
Ohh!

09:57.661 --> 09:58.961
What is that?

09:59.029 --> 10:00.229
Bok choy, Chef?

10:00.297 --> 10:01.563
What?

10:01.631 --> 10:02.698
White asparagus.

10:02.766 --> 10:04.466
Oh, .

10:04.534 --> 10:07.369
Oh, I felt like
such a dumbass.

10:07.437 --> 10:09.204
Okay, let's knock it
down a touch.

10:09.272 --> 10:10.639
Let's go a little bit
simpler.

10:10.707 --> 10:12.574
A nice slice of filet mignon.

10:12.642 --> 10:13.742
Oh.
Oh, come on.

10:17.514 --> 10:18.681
<i>What is that?</i>

10:18.748 --> 10:19.748
Chicken, Chef.

10:19.816 --> 10:20.883
Ooh!

10:20.951 --> 10:23.252
Oh, man.

10:23.320 --> 10:25.688
He Eats enough.

10:27.624 --> 10:28.691
Filet mignon.

10:28.758 --> 10:29.892
Oh, my God.

10:29.960 --> 10:31.126
What is that?

10:31.194 --> 10:32.227
Chicken, Chef!

10:32.295 --> 10:33.362
Ohh!

10:33.430 --> 10:35.297
Filet mignon.
Aggh!

10:35.365 --> 10:37.066
You, Rob.

10:37.133 --> 10:39.134
You can't taste the difference
between beef and chicken,

10:39.202 --> 10:40.035
I don't even know
why you're here.

10:40.103 --> 10:42.338
Two to one, to the men.

10:42.405 --> 10:44.673
Rob and Sabrina
have missed the first two items.

10:44.741 --> 10:46.709
At least they have
the same palate.

10:46.776 --> 10:47.609
And are hoping
to redeem themselves

10:47.677 --> 10:48.544
with the next item.

10:50.013 --> 10:51.080
American cheese, Chef.

10:51.147 --> 10:52.781
Ohh!
Come on!

10:52.849 --> 10:53.749
Provolone cheese?

10:53.817 --> 10:55.417
What?!

10:55.485 --> 10:57.186
But instead
fall further from grace.

10:57.253 --> 10:58.854
That's creamy,
mature cheddar.

10:58.922 --> 10:59.822
On their final try...

11:01.658 --> 11:03.058
Rob...
Octopus, Chef?

11:03.126 --> 11:04.393
Octopus?

11:04.461 --> 11:06.161
Chokes again,

11:06.229 --> 11:08.097
giving Sabrina an opportunity
to tie the score

11:08.164 --> 11:09.298
for the women.

11:09.366 --> 11:10.332
What is that?

11:10.400 --> 11:11.300
Smoked...

11:11.368 --> 11:13.569
Say it.

11:13.636 --> 11:16.705
Say mussels.
Mussels, mussels, mussels.

11:16.773 --> 11:18.374
Um, smoked ham?

11:19.609 --> 11:21.710
What?! No!

11:21.778 --> 11:23.212
Smoked mussels.

11:23.279 --> 11:24.947
Cheddar cheese, asparagus,
filet mignon!

11:25.015 --> 11:27.016
Zero!

11:27.083 --> 11:28.917
Zero, bro.

11:28.985 --> 11:31.286
It felt horrible to not put
any points up for my team.

11:31.354 --> 11:32.888
You know, if we lose,

11:32.956 --> 11:34.656
it's gonna come back
to haunt me.

11:34.724 --> 11:36.525
With neither Rob or Sabrina

11:36.593 --> 11:38.494
able to score a point
for their team...

11:38.561 --> 11:40.062
<i>Jillian and Vinny, let's go.</i>

11:40.130 --> 11:41.897
Come on, Jillian.

11:41.965 --> 11:43.198
The blue team
is still up by one.

11:43.266 --> 11:44.733
Come on, Jillian.

11:44.801 --> 11:46.502
Now it's up to line cook Vinny

11:46.569 --> 11:47.503
to do battle
with sous Chef Jillian

11:47.570 --> 11:49.171
and maintain the men's lead.

11:49.239 --> 11:51.073
Y.
Hot dog.

11:51.141 --> 11:52.474
Both Vinny and Jillian...

11:52.542 --> 11:53.509
Smoked ham.

11:53.576 --> 11:55.477
Salami?

11:55.545 --> 11:57.112
Incorrectly identify hot dog.

11:57.180 --> 11:59.381
Hot dog.
Hot dog, .

11:59.449 --> 12:01.683
But quickly redeem themselves
by correctly identifying...

12:01.751 --> 12:03.619
Cooked potatoes?

12:03.686 --> 12:04.753
And mozzarella cheese.

12:04.821 --> 12:05.788
Fresh mozzarel.

12:07.524 --> 12:09.691
You can't give Vinny "boombatz"
from Queens, New York

12:09.759 --> 12:11.160
mozzarel and think
that I'm gonna flounder it.

12:11.227 --> 12:12.828
Back in line, guys.

12:12.896 --> 12:14.696
With both Vinny and Jillian

12:14.764 --> 12:16.365
earning a respectable
two points each,

12:16.433 --> 12:18.667
the blue team's margin
remains razor-thin

12:18.735 --> 12:20.185
going into the final round.

12:20.253 --> 12:22.087
Here we go.
Nona, Trev.

12:22.155 --> 12:23.589
And the men
are counting on Trev

12:23.656 --> 12:25.491
to bring it home
for the blue.

12:25.558 --> 12:27.025
<i>Let's go for something simple.</i>

12:28.461 --> 12:29.361
Pear.
Oh, pear.

12:29.429 --> 12:30.929
They'll both know this.

12:30.997 --> 12:32.631
Let's go.
This is your one time to shine.

12:32.699 --> 12:34.266
So them bitches that they

12:34.334 --> 12:35.267
Up sending you
over here; Let's go.

12:35.335 --> 12:37.002
What is that?

12:37.070 --> 12:38.137
Apple.

12:41.174 --> 12:42.841
What is that?

12:42.909 --> 12:45.778
Come on, Nona, pear.
Come on, Nona.

12:45.845 --> 12:46.912
It's apple or jicama.

12:46.980 --> 12:47.946
Ohh.

12:48.014 --> 12:49.081
Ugh.
Ohh.

12:49.149 --> 12:50.649
Damn it!
We need to tie up.

12:50.717 --> 12:51.650
We need to tie up,
we need to tie up.

12:55.188 --> 12:56.421
Come on, Nona.

12:56.489 --> 12:58.390
What is that?
Halibut?

12:58.458 --> 13:00.192
He missed scallops.

13:00.260 --> 13:01.860
And he's cooked them
in both kitchens.

13:01.928 --> 13:02.995
Th kitchens.

13:03.062 --> 13:05.564
What is that?

13:05.632 --> 13:07.499
Come on, Nona, scallops.

13:07.567 --> 13:09.268
Come on, Nona, make a tie,
make a tie, make a tie.

13:09.335 --> 13:10.335
Scallop?

13:10.403 --> 13:11.837
Yes!

13:11.905 --> 13:13.872
Yes! Yes! Yes!

13:13.940 --> 13:15.007
Four to four.

13:15.074 --> 13:15.974
We're even now.

13:16.042 --> 13:17.309
Son of a bitch.

13:17.377 --> 13:20.012
Yes!
<i>Okay...</i>

13:20.079 --> 13:22.347
With both Trev and Nona
correctly identifying...

13:22.415 --> 13:23.415
Squash.
Squash.

13:23.483 --> 13:25.184
Yes, got it.
Yes.

13:25.251 --> 13:26.552
The competition
remains deadlocked.

13:26.619 --> 13:28.320
Me, man.

13:28.388 --> 13:30.355
And there's only
one item left.

13:30.423 --> 13:32.958
It all comes down to this.

13:33.026 --> 13:34.860
Okay...

13:40.466 --> 13:43.068
Trev, come on.
Save my ass.

13:43.136 --> 13:44.369
If Trev doesn't
pull this out,

13:44.437 --> 13:46.071
the 'S on me.

13:46.139 --> 13:47.573
<i>Come on, Nona.</i>

What is that?

13:51.277 --> 13:52.277
Arugula?

13:53.580 --> 13:55.547
Damn!

13:55.615 --> 13:57.649
Come on, Nona, come on, Nona.
You've got this, girl.

13:57.717 --> 13:59.618
We have to win this challenge.

13:59.686 --> 14:00.519
What is that?

14:03.890 --> 14:04.756
Um...

14:11.601 --> 14:13.569
The score is tied
in the final round

14:13.637 --> 14:15.204
of the blind taste test.

14:15.283 --> 14:16.224
Five to five.

14:16.324 --> 14:18.822
With only one item left,
line cook Trev

14:18.830 --> 14:20.064
failed to correctly
identify endive.

14:20.131 --> 14:21.398
Arugula?

14:21.466 --> 14:23.167
Giving sous Chef Nona...

14:23.234 --> 14:24.968
Um...

14:25.036 --> 14:26.070
The opportunity to win it
for the red team.

14:29.574 --> 14:30.874
Endive?

14:32.277 --> 14:33.911
You've got to be Me.

14:33.978 --> 14:37.815
Yes! We win!
We win, we win, we win!

14:37.882 --> 14:39.083
Nona!

14:39.084 --> 14:43.620
[Women

14:43.688 --> 14:44.922
Nona is the bane
of my existence,

14:44.989 --> 14:46.256
I'll be honest with you.

14:46.324 --> 14:48.292
For some reason,
she's my Kryptonite.

14:51.229 --> 14:52.896
Three out of four!
You have the best palate.

14:52.964 --> 14:54.965
Well done, Nona.
Amazing.

14:55.033 --> 14:56.433
Three out of four,

14:56.501 --> 14:57.634
Thank you, Chef.

14:57.702 --> 14:59.236
I've brought us back.

14:59.304 --> 15:01.405
I saved the day,
and it feels great.

15:01.473 --> 15:02.940
<i>Okay, ladies,</i>

15:03.007 --> 15:07.511
you're gonna have
a tasting sensation today.

15:07.579 --> 15:09.813
To Michael Mina's
restaurant, XIV.

15:11.449 --> 15:13.317
That's one of the best
restaurants in L.A.

15:13.385 --> 15:14.918
How Amazing.
Are you kidding me?

15:14.986 --> 15:17.554
Before we go,

15:17.622 --> 15:19.123
<i>Yes!</i>

15:34.873 --> 15:36.006
Zero for four.

15:36.074 --> 15:37.708
This really sucks.

15:37.776 --> 15:39.343
I mean, I feel horrible
that I didn't get any points.

15:39.411 --> 15:41.178
I mean, I'm embarrassed.

15:41.246 --> 15:43.447
Your punishment.

15:43.515 --> 15:45.682
We are always ahead of the times
here in Hell's Kitchen.

15:45.750 --> 15:48.719
And we believe
in being green.

15:48.787 --> 15:51.054

16:15.280 --> 16:16.480
goes in the blue bins,

16:16.548 --> 16:18.649
<i>and all non-recyclable waste</i>

16:18.716 --> 16:20.117
<i>goes in the black bins.</i>

16:24.322 --> 16:26.757
6% of waste
from restaurants

16:26.825 --> 16:28.192
<i>is recyclable.</i>

16:30.795 --> 16:33.797
I saw all those bags--
boom, boom, boom,

16:33.865 --> 16:34.832
falling out.

16:34.899 --> 16:36.433
I felt like the garbage

16:36.501 --> 16:38.035
being pushed out
of that Truck.

16:42.340 --> 16:44.441
We haven't won any
of the last challenges, bro.

16:44.509 --> 16:46.343
Don't put this on me, man.

16:46.411 --> 16:48.512
<i>I should put it on me</i>
<i>or Vinny that got a couple--</i>

16:48.580 --> 16:50.514
no, I'm not saying
you should put it on anyone.

16:50.582 --> 16:51.148
I think it was a team loss,
don't you think?

16:51.216 --> 16:52.649
Nope.

16:52.717 --> 16:54.251
I was thinking about tossing Rob
out with the trash,

16:54.319 --> 16:55.085
but I can't pick him up.

16:55.153 --> 16:56.787
So I said my piece and...

16:56.855 --> 17:00.224
Wanted him to just own up
and take some responsibility.

17:00.291 --> 17:02.259
Hey, uh, if anybody wants
that chicken salad sandwich--

17:02.327 --> 17:05.762
<i>oh, yeah, yeah!</i>

17:05.829 --> 17:07.564
<i>Hell, this I</i>

17:07.632 --> 17:10.067
I see sunlight!

17:12.569 --> 17:14.037
Give us a hug!

17:14.105 --> 17:15.271
No!

17:15.339 --> 17:17.241
Don't you miss me?

17:17.308 --> 17:18.709
Just a little bit?

17:18.776 --> 17:20.210
<i>Come on!</i>

17:20.278 --> 17:22.179
<i>See you guys later.</i>
Bye!

17:22.247 --> 17:23.446
<i>How 'bout that</i>
<i>red team, Trev?</i>

17:23.515 --> 17:24.815
Don't get used to it.

17:24.883 --> 17:25.983
<i>That's what you get!</i>

17:26.050 --> 17:28.819
You, Sabrina!

17:28.887 --> 17:32.155
While Trev works out
his issues,

17:32.223 --> 17:35.192
the women indulge in a little
retail therapy.

17:35.260 --> 17:36.360
What?

17:36.427 --> 17:39.162
This is so cute.
I want this.

17:39.230 --> 17:41.198
We walk in and racks upon racks

17:41.266 --> 17:43.634
upon racks of clothes
upon clothes.

17:43.701 --> 17:45.035
So happy to be shopping!

17:45.103 --> 17:46.770
Do you have these ones
in a seven?

17:48.373 --> 17:51.308
I love the pants!
I love the pants!

17:51.376 --> 17:53.911
I think that they
designed everything...

17:53.978 --> 17:55.379
Just for me,

17:55.446 --> 17:57.948
because everything
fit me perfectly.

17:58.016 --> 18:00.083
Is it a little much?
Is it a little much?

18:00.151 --> 18:01.218
A little much.
You think Chef
is gonna like it?

18:01.286 --> 18:02.619
I think Chef might like it.

18:02.687 --> 18:04.521
Look at me.
Superstar.

18:04.589 --> 18:06.290
Let me see your shoes!

18:06.357 --> 18:08.525
Oh, my God.

18:08.593 --> 18:10.193
The four of us could be

18:10.261 --> 18:12.496
like the spice girls
of <i>Hell's Kitchen.</i>

18:12.564 --> 18:13.497
Why not?

18:13.565 --> 18:14.498
Let's go, let's go.

18:14.566 --> 18:15.866
Thank you!

18:17.235 --> 18:19.403
Whoo! Yummy!

18:19.470 --> 18:21.238
How you doin', fellas?

18:21.306 --> 18:22.873
<i>Fantastic.</i>
<i>What's going on,</i>
<i>Chef Scott?</i>

18:22.941 --> 18:24.074
<i>Why don't you guys</i>
<i>take a break?</i>

18:24.142 --> 18:25.409
I got some lunch
here for you.

18:25.476 --> 18:26.977
Grab a seat.
Have a sandwich.

18:27.045 --> 18:30.581
Chef Scott came out with some
single Slices of cheese

18:30.648 --> 18:32.983
wrapped in their own plastic,
and then some white bread.

18:33.051 --> 18:35.719
So it was kind of like being
on prison detail or something.

18:38.856 --> 18:40.691
While the men
swallow their pride,

18:40.758 --> 18:42.759
the women...
How are you guys?

18:42.827 --> 18:44.861
Enjoy a decadent feast
with Chef Ramsey.

18:44.929 --> 18:46.229
<i>L.A. Market is not gonna be</i>

18:46.297 --> 18:47.698
five or six on the line.

18:47.765 --> 18:48.865
It's gonna be
a big restaurant

18:48.933 --> 18:50.400
with a huge brigade.

18:50.468 --> 18:52.603
And I need to find
that leader, quick.

18:52.670 --> 18:53.937
<i>And I need you guys</i>
<i>to open up</i>

18:54.005 --> 18:55.405
and start becoming leaders.

18:55.473 --> 18:56.506
There's only
four of you here.

18:56.574 --> 18:58.275
Chef always inspires me.

18:58.343 --> 19:00.444
He really wants to see
the leader in me.

19:00.511 --> 19:03.313
And I know that that's what
I'm gonna have to give him.

19:03.381 --> 19:04.615
Now to the boys.

19:04.682 --> 19:05.515
Yeah?

19:11.823 --> 19:13.757
Hi.
Hello.

19:13.825 --> 19:15.559
The women return
from their reward refreshed.

19:18.930 --> 19:21.064
And ready to continue
their winning streak.

19:21.132 --> 19:24.267
But on the blue team, Trev's
first day back with the men...

19:24.335 --> 19:25.202
Saute 'em with what?

19:27.972 --> 19:30.307
Is not living up
to his expectations.

19:30.375 --> 19:31.608
I need another towel
for a second.

19:31.676 --> 19:32.709
<i>Somebody give me one.</i>

19:32.777 --> 19:33.543
You need towels?
<i>I need towels.</i>

19:33.611 --> 19:35.278
I don't have one.

19:35.346 --> 19:37.214
I'm not happy to have Trevor
back on the blue team.

19:37.281 --> 19:38.782
We want to get rid of him.

19:38.850 --> 19:39.883
So it's gonna
get a little grimy.

19:39.951 --> 19:40.984
It's gonna get a little dirty.

19:41.052 --> 19:41.752
Let's just
let the games begin.

19:41.819 --> 19:42.753
Do we have any towels?

19:46.157 --> 19:48.225
I don't know
what's going on with them.

19:48.292 --> 19:50.227
I can just tell that
things have Changed.

19:50.294 --> 19:51.928
Salmon's done?
Don't know.

19:51.996 --> 19:53.363
Yeah, thanks a lot.

19:53.431 --> 19:54.431
I feel like
I'm the odd man out,

19:54.499 --> 19:55.565
which I Am.

19:55.633 --> 19:57.567
Rusty, give me a hand
with this?

19:57.635 --> 19:59.569
Bro, you're on your own.

19:59.637 --> 20:01.171
If I don't shine,
if I don't stand out,

20:01.239 --> 20:02.339
they're gonna send me home.

20:02.407 --> 20:03.573
Let's go, guys, please.

20:11.939 --> 20:13.740
Tonight will be Trev's
first dinner service

20:13.808 --> 20:14.808
back on the blue team.

20:14.876 --> 20:15.775
Saute 'em with what?

20:18.679 --> 20:21.815
And so far, he isn't exactly
feeling the love.

20:21.883 --> 20:23.250
Rusty, can you give me
a hand with this?

20:23.317 --> 20:24.317
Bro, you're on your own.

20:26.154 --> 20:28.555
Hey, they don't want
to listen to what I have to say,

20:28.623 --> 20:29.890
well, there's a couple of
different ways

20:29.957 --> 20:30.690
this can work out.

20:30.758 --> 20:31.958
We can bicker and fight,

20:32.026 --> 20:33.960
ck it down
and get it done.

20:34.028 --> 20:35.629
But, ultimately,
we have to win.

20:35.696 --> 20:37.130
Good luck, Vinny.
Thank you, Chef.

20:37.198 --> 20:39.065
I appreciate it.
Hey, you guys ready?

20:39.133 --> 20:40.901
It's terrible when Chef Scott
has to wish us good luck

20:40.968 --> 20:41.935
to get through the night.

20:44.238 --> 20:45.805
Let's go, guys, please.

20:45.873 --> 20:47.541
The blue team has come up empty

20:47.608 --> 20:49.075
on the last three challenges
and dinner services.

20:49.143 --> 20:50.777
Come on...Let's go.

20:50.845 --> 20:53.213
And
is definitely concerned.

20:53.281 --> 20:54.681
You guys are gluttons
for punishment.

20:54.749 --> 20:56.249
What's the matter with you?

20:56.317 --> 20:57.450
I'm not happy about it.
I'm Pissed.

20:57.518 --> 20:59.052
Can't you win a challenge?

20:59.120 --> 21:01.154
<i>I've never had</i>
<i>such a run of bad luck</i>

21:01.222 --> 21:02.556
from the blue team

21:02.623 --> 21:04.224
in the history
of <i>Hell's Kitchen.</i>

21:04.292 --> 21:06.159
<i>The big question,</i>
<i>to all of you:</i>

21:06.227 --> 21:07.627
Are you gonna
turn it around tonight?

21:07.695 --> 21:08.728
Yes, Chef.

21:08.796 --> 21:09.863
'Cause this
is where it counts.

21:09.931 --> 21:11.331
It's four and four.

21:11.399 --> 21:13.266
<i>There's nowhere to hide,</i>
<i>for any of you.</i>

21:13.334 --> 21:14.734
Let's go, yeah?
Yes, Chef.

21:14.802 --> 21:16.403
Right, James...
Yes, Chef?

21:16.470 --> 21:17.837
Open Hell's Kitchen, please.

21:17.905 --> 21:18.371
<i>Let's go.</i>
Chef.

21:20.000 --> 21:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

21:31.786 --> 21:33.520
I'm gonna start with
the scallops.

21:33.588 --> 21:35.222
I'm going to have
the halibut.

21:35.289 --> 21:36.623
I'll have the rib eye.
Very good.

21:36.691 --> 21:38.225
Hey.

21:38.292 --> 21:40.994
Go, ladies.
Here we go.

21:41.062 --> 21:42.796
Six orders away.
Table 31.

21:42.863 --> 21:43.930
<i>Two scallops, two spaghetti,</i>
<i>two risotto.</i>

21:43.998 --> 21:45.398
Easy ticket.
Yes, Chef!

21:45.466 --> 21:47.334
Here we go, five orders.
Table 22.

21:47.401 --> 21:49.336
<i>Three risotto, one spaghetti,</i>
<i>one truffle salad.</i>

21:49.403 --> 21:50.537
How easy is that?
Yes, Chef.

21:50.605 --> 21:52.505
<i>Let's go, Trev!</i>

21:52.573 --> 21:53.540
With orders flying
into the kitchen,

21:53.608 --> 21:55.041
Trev on appetizers...

21:55.109 --> 21:56.743
<i>Trev, that risotto...</i>

21:56.811 --> 21:58.245
Yeah, it tastes fantastic.
Keep every one like that.

21:58.312 --> 22:00.447
Earns some much-needed respect

22:00.514 --> 22:02.482
by getting his team off
to a pt.

22:02.550 --> 22:04.517
This is
we got a shot here, let's go!

22:04.585 --> 22:06.286
Over in the red kitchen...

22:06.354 --> 22:07.887
Are you ready, Jill?
Ready!

22:07.955 --> 22:08.989
<i>Two risottos, Chef!</i>

22:09.056 --> 22:10.991
Jillian on appetizers.

22:11.058 --> 22:13.193
<i>Very nice, that risotto.</i>
Thank you, Chef!

22:13.261 --> 22:14.961
And Sabrina...
Walking scallops!

22:15.029 --> 22:15.996
On fish...

22:16.063 --> 22:17.430
My scallops are ready.

22:17.498 --> 22:18.898
Are also helping to impress.

22:18.966 --> 22:20.033
<i>Sabrina...</i>
Yes, Chef?

22:21.836 --> 22:23.803
They're nicely colored,
those scallops.

22:23.871 --> 22:25.171
I want all those scallops
cooked like that, yes?

22:25.239 --> 22:26.373
Yes, Chef!

22:26.440 --> 22:28.275
Heh,
they were perfect.

22:28.342 --> 22:30.076
Service please.

22:30.144 --> 22:31.911
I got my team
off to a great start.

22:31.979 --> 22:33.246
We gotta beat those stupid,
sorry-ass boys.

22:33.314 --> 22:35.849
Come on, guys, let's
Kick their ass.

22:35.916 --> 22:37.550
With appetizers quickly making
their way to the dining room...

22:37.618 --> 22:38.918
First table, entrees:

22:38.986 --> 22:41.154
One halibut,
two chicken, two beef.

22:41.222 --> 22:42.789
The women are already
moving on to entrees.

22:42.857 --> 22:44.324
<i>Exactly the way I want it!</i>

22:44.392 --> 22:45.191
<i>Working appetizers</i>
<i>and entrees.</i>

22:45.259 --> 22:46.293
Appetizers, entrees!

22:46.360 --> 22:48.295
Yes, Chef!

22:48.362 --> 22:50.196
While diners enjoy their food
on the red side...

22:50.264 --> 22:53.166
On the blue side...

22:53.234 --> 22:55.702
One diner is still waiting
for an appetizer.

22:55.770 --> 22:57.671
Oh, come on.
Rob!

22:57.738 --> 23:00.206
And it looks like her wait
is far from over.

23:00.274 --> 23:01.675
<i>Look, come here.</i>
<i>Look.</i>

23:01.742 --> 23:03.643
Where's the sear
on the scallops?

23:03.711 --> 23:04.911
That's curry powder!

23:04.979 --> 23:06.179
Just eat that!

23:06.247 --> 23:08.982
The whole Thing.
Eat it.

23:09.050 --> 23:11.017
Yeah.
Eat it!

23:11.085 --> 23:13.653
<i>It's a mouthful of curry!</i>

23:13.721 --> 23:15.055
Rob!
Yes, Chef?

23:15.122 --> 23:17.057
Wake up!
Yes, Chef!

23:17.124 --> 23:19.492
But I don't even think it was
that bad, the scallops.

23:19.560 --> 23:21.594
Chef Ramsey's got standards
that are really, really high.

23:21.662 --> 23:24.698
And he's kind of like all over
my Right now.

23:24.765 --> 23:27.500
Come on, I can't send the next
table till this one goes out.

23:27.568 --> 23:29.602
They're on their fifth ticket.
You're on your second.

23:29.670 --> 23:31.705
We gotta come back with this.
Let's go!

23:31.772 --> 23:33.173
Push it out!
<i>Come on, Rob!</i>

23:33.240 --> 23:34.341
Yes, Chef.
Move it, big boy.

23:34.408 --> 23:36.142
Yes, Chef!

23:36.210 --> 23:37.077
Rob, move!
<i>Yes, Chef!</i>

23:42.183 --> 23:43.883
There's no color on there.

23:43.951 --> 23:46.653
He's just not starting
with the pan hot enough.

23:46.721 --> 23:50.523
I've got no Color
on m

23:52.059 --> 23:53.693
for 'S sake!

23:53.761 --> 23:55.495
Come on, let's get through

23:55.563 --> 23:57.330
a Service, please!

23:57.398 --> 23:58.965
They're raw-raw!

23:59.033 --> 24:00.700
<i>I gave 'em</i>
<i>a minute each side.</i>

24:00.768 --> 24:01.935
What's that got to do with it?
Where's your oil?

24:02.002 --> 24:03.503
That's Raw!

24:03.571 --> 24:05.905
You take them out
when they're Cooked.

24:05.973 --> 24:07.874
That table's eating,
bar one!

24:07.942 --> 24:09.909
Ninth service, and Rob still
can't cook scallops.

24:09.977 --> 24:12.011
Rob, the largest one
is the thickest one.

24:12.079 --> 24:13.613
So that comes out last.

24:13.681 --> 24:15.982
, Rob, are you
a complete Idiot?

24:16.050 --> 24:17.717
Sorry about the delay.
Let's go.

24:17.785 --> 24:19.519
It won't happen again, guys.
I got it.

24:19.587 --> 24:21.688
No thanks to Rob...
Service, please.

24:21.756 --> 24:23.790
Rob, gotta turn it
around, bro.
Let's go,
we gotta catch up.

24:23.858 --> 24:24.824
Scallops have finally
left the blue kitchen.

24:24.892 --> 24:26.226
Oh, my gosh.

24:26.293 --> 24:28.228
And in the red kitchen...

24:28.295 --> 24:29.529
Two chicken, two beef,
one Wellington, one halibut.

24:29.597 --> 24:30.663
Chef Ramsey is hoping

24:30.731 --> 24:31.865
to keep up the momentum
on entrees.

24:31.932 --> 24:33.166
How long?
Four minutes.

24:33.234 --> 24:34.634
Let's Go!

24:34.702 --> 24:36.269
<i>Nona, what I don't</i>
<i>understand</i>

24:36.337 --> 24:38.238
is why that chicken's
taking so Long?

24:38.305 --> 24:40.206
Because I didn't drop it
right when you called for it.

24:40.274 --> 24:42.175
Oh, Hell.

24:42.243 --> 24:44.144
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>Nona!</i>

24:44.211 --> 24:46.946
Move your ass!
<i>Four minutes.</i>

24:47.014 --> 24:49.115
<i>Damn, I can't</i>
<i>cut this chicken.</i>

24:52.319 --> 24:54.053
Come on, you Piece
of Chicken.

24:54.121 --> 24:57.624
Dude! Chicken is, like,
so easy.

24:57.691 --> 25:00.427
I have to take charge before
it gets out of control.

25:00.494 --> 25:02.729
We're ready to walk
in two minutes, right, Nona?

25:02.797 --> 25:04.497
<i>Minute and a half!</i>
<i>Minute and a half!</i>

25:04.565 --> 25:05.331
How long for halibut garnish,
Gail?

25:05.399 --> 25:06.766
Halibut garnish is ready!

25:06.834 --> 25:08.001
Okay, I'm walking
my halibut.

25:08.068 --> 25:09.402
We got this, we got this.

25:09.470 --> 25:10.437
I'm cutting the chicken!

25:10.504 --> 25:11.471
Walking halibut.

25:14.675 --> 25:16.342
Sabrina!
Yes, Chef?

25:16.410 --> 25:17.510
That's perfectly cooked
halibut.

25:17.578 --> 25:19.212
Thank you, Chef!

25:19.280 --> 25:20.713
Keep pushing it, ladies, okay?
We can't stop.

25:20.781 --> 25:22.415
Service.

25:22.483 --> 25:23.783
Under Sabrina's
surprising leadership...

25:23.851 --> 25:25.151
Bringing chicken.

25:25.219 --> 25:26.686
The women are back on track.

25:26.754 --> 25:27.854
Chicken here, please.
Thank you.

25:27.922 --> 25:30.857
So next up is a Wellington
and two halibut!

25:30.925 --> 25:32.759
But over in the blue kitchen...

25:32.827 --> 25:33.593
Let's go--two halibut
and one beef.

25:33.661 --> 25:34.627
Are you close?

25:34.695 --> 25:36.196
Halibut is a minute behind.

25:36.263 --> 25:37.897
Rob's halibut is threatening

25:37.965 --> 25:39.265
to derail the men's
flow of entrees.

25:39.333 --> 25:40.633
Talk to me, bro!

25:40.701 --> 25:42.168
I'm close.
I am close.

25:42.236 --> 25:43.903
<i>Let's go!</i>
<i>Go to the window!</i>

25:43.971 --> 25:45.338
I think I'm gonna need
a little more on the halibut.

25:45.406 --> 25:46.439
Just go!

25:46.507 --> 25:47.574
<i>Beef's right here, Chef.</i>

25:47.641 --> 25:48.741
Left-hand side, beef.

25:48.809 --> 25:50.510
Halibut coming now, Chef.

25:57.017 --> 25:58.818
Off.

25:58.886 --> 26:00.553
N.

26:00.621 --> 26:02.055
Come here, you.

26:02.122 --> 26:03.790
Look at that.
It's like split vomit.

26:03.858 --> 26:04.958
Look at that.
Hold on.

26:05.025 --> 26:06.559
It gets worse.

26:06.627 --> 26:09.128
Raw. !

26:09.196 --> 26:10.930
Damn it, let's go!
Focus!

26:10.998 --> 26:12.298
Sorry, bro, sorry.

26:12.366 --> 26:13.466
<i>Quit saying sorry</i>
<i>and just go!</i>

26:13.534 --> 26:14.934
<i>Guys, we need to go!</i>

26:15.002 --> 26:16.236
Here we go yet again.

26:16.303 --> 26:18.638
Nothing's coming out!

26:18.706 --> 26:20.440
Hey, you. Come here, you.
Come here, you.

26:20.508 --> 26:22.041
<i>Come here, you.</i>
<i>Come here, you.</i>

26:27.114 --> 26:29.415
There goes Rob.

26:29.483 --> 26:30.650
Bye, Rob.

26:38.364 --> 26:41.066
It's just over an hour
into dinner service...

26:41.133 --> 26:42.000
Look at that.
Raw.

26:42.068 --> 26:43.802
Off.

26:43.869 --> 26:45.236
And Rob's problems
on the fish station

26:45.304 --> 26:46.705
have prevented the men

26:46.772 --> 26:47.639
from getting out
any of their entrees.

26:47.707 --> 26:49.574
Let's go! Focus!

26:49.642 --> 26:52.143
And that has pushed Chef Ramsey
to the brink.

26:52.211 --> 26:54.512
Hey, you.
Come here, you.

26:54.580 --> 26:57.015
Come here, you.
Come here, you.

26:57.083 --> 26:58.416
Oh, , here we go.

26:58.484 --> 27:00.118
Chef calls him out
to the d

27:00.186 --> 27:02.020
that's not a good thing.

27:02.088 --> 27:03.555
You've got five minutes
to wake up,

27:03.622 --> 27:05.056
otherwise, you're history.

27:05.124 --> 27:07.258
Yeah, hey...Hey.
Hey, big boy,

27:07.326 --> 27:08.426
and I mean five minutes.

27:08.494 --> 27:09.861
I'll do it my Self,

27:09.929 --> 27:11.596
and I'll do
on the station myself,

27:11.664 --> 27:14.432
and I'll run the Whole
plate on my Own!

27:14.500 --> 27:16.368
Whew, that was a close call.

27:16.435 --> 27:18.203
From now on, I'm gonna
keep my head together,

27:18.270 --> 27:19.771
and I gotta do better.

27:19.839 --> 27:21.473
All right, bro, sorry.

27:21.540 --> 27:23.742
This is not the time
to go down--let's go!

27:23.809 --> 27:25.043
Rob was going down
in a ball of flame,

27:25.111 --> 27:26.444
so I'm just gonna start
putting my foot down

27:26.512 --> 27:28.680
and smashing guts, ya heard?

27:28.748 --> 27:30.248
<i>How long on the re-fire?</i>

27:30.316 --> 27:31.583
Let me check the fish.
Hold on.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.418
Damn it, let's go!
Focus!

27:33.486 --> 27:35.954
Sometimes Russell can turn
into a bossy little bitch.

27:36.022 --> 27:38.456
He gets loud when Chef Ramsey's
on our side.

27:38.524 --> 27:39.657
Where are we at?

27:41.360 --> 27:43.495
Then, like, it's crickets
when he leaves.

27:43.562 --> 27:45.130
He shuts down, he shuts up,
he doesn't help anybody,

27:45.197 --> 27:46.431
and he does his thing.

27:46.499 --> 27:48.133
Talk to me.

27:48.200 --> 27:49.601
Come on, Rob!

27:49.668 --> 27:51.136
Come on, Rob.
Get your Together.

27:51.203 --> 27:52.203
Let's go, guys!

27:52.271 --> 27:53.705
Halibut coming now, Chef.

27:53.773 --> 27:55.040
Psh, whatever, man.

28:02.081 --> 28:03.782
Service, please.

28:03.849 --> 28:05.750
Rob has finally
delivered a halibut

28:05.818 --> 28:08.553
to Chef Ramsey's standards.
Mmm.

28:08.621 --> 28:10.722
And diners on the blue side
are enjoying their entrees.

28:10.790 --> 28:12.257
This is really good.

28:12.324 --> 28:13.458
But diners on the red side

28:13.526 --> 28:14.359
are now waiting for theirs.

28:14.427 --> 28:15.727
I'm pretty hungry now.

28:15.795 --> 28:17.595
Can't believe how long
we've been waiting.

28:17.663 --> 28:19.531
And all eyes are on Nona

28:19.598 --> 28:20.765
on the meat station.

28:20.833 --> 28:22.233
Two beef!
How long?

28:22.301 --> 28:23.334
<i>We're about six minutes.</i>

28:23.402 --> 28:24.869
Just why is it so long?

28:24.937 --> 28:26.071
I've got one beef--
one beef going,

28:26.138 --> 28:27.038
one beef resting.

28:27.106 --> 28:28.239
So you forgot a beef?

28:28.307 --> 28:29.307
<i>No, I didn't forget it.</i>

28:29.375 --> 28:31.076
Come here.

28:31.143 --> 28:32.844
Let me explain something to you
in plain english.
Yes?

28:32.912 --> 28:34.979
By now, these meats
should be seared.

28:35.047 --> 28:36.281
Yes, Chef.
One's seared,

28:36.348 --> 28:38.183
one's just gone
in the pan.

28:38.250 --> 28:39.617
This late in the day,

28:39.685 --> 28:41.853
I'm amazed that there's
only one beef.

28:41.921 --> 28:43.321
Yes, Chef!
Yeah.

28:43.389 --> 28:44.689
Next ticket's three beef,
one salmon.

28:44.757 --> 28:45.690
Yes, Chef!

28:45.758 --> 28:47.225
Where's the three beef?

28:47.293 --> 28:49.027
I'm putting 'em in
right now, Chef.

28:49.095 --> 28:50.562
Hey, look at me.

28:50.629 --> 28:52.497
You're not even listening!
I'm trying to help you!

28:52.565 --> 28:53.698
I know, and I'm taking
what you're saying--

28:53.766 --> 28:55.233
well, these should be
Seared by now!

28:55.301 --> 28:56.367
Yes, Chef!

28:56.435 --> 28:57.635
It would help
if the pan was on.

28:57.703 --> 28:58.803
It's on, Chef!

28:58.871 --> 29:00.305
Me.
Out of my way.

29:00.372 --> 29:01.806
Look at that, does that
look Hot

29:01.874 --> 29:03.341
to sear three beef?

29:03.409 --> 29:04.776
Let me show you something.
Look.

29:04.844 --> 29:06.211
There you go.

29:06.278 --> 29:07.278
There, it's hot, Chef.

29:07.346 --> 29:08.246
<i>I just put 'em in!</i>

29:10.149 --> 29:11.316
Get out of my way.

29:11.383 --> 29:13.518
Get out
of my Way.

29:13.586 --> 29:15.487
Get out of my Way!

29:15.554 --> 29:17.522
I'm not in your way!

29:17.590 --> 29:18.923
Get upstairs then!

29:18.991 --> 29:20.425
All right, fine.
Off.

29:20.493 --> 29:22.260
S, Chef?

29:22.328 --> 29:23.695
Start working that section.
You got it, Chef.

29:26.265 --> 29:28.366
You know, I get
kicked out of the kitchen...

29:28.434 --> 29:30.468
And, you know, I was just
starting to emerge

29:30.536 --> 29:33.271
showing Chef that I can try
and lead this team.

29:33.339 --> 29:34.939
I have so much more to show,

29:35.007 --> 29:36.541
and so much more to prove.

29:41.514 --> 29:43.948
While Nona ponders her future
in <i>Hell's Kitchen,</i>

29:44.016 --> 29:45.517
over on the blue side...

29:45.584 --> 29:47.385
What?
I don't know.

29:47.453 --> 29:49.487
Chef Ramsey's patience
is wearing thin.

29:49.555 --> 29:50.788
Honestly, I'm gonna let rip
in a minute.

29:50.856 --> 29:52.157
I swear to God.

29:52.224 --> 29:53.191
Mistakes are piling up.

29:53.259 --> 29:54.826
It's cooked to .

29:54.894 --> 29:56.060
And Vinny's spinach with egg...

29:56.128 --> 29:57.896
Has raised some questions.

29:57.963 --> 29:59.230
<i>Are you serious?</i>

30:01.133 --> 30:02.500
Oh, what the ?

30:02.568 --> 30:04.269
Hey, come here.
All of you, come here.

30:04.336 --> 30:06.004
Just touch that egg.
Just touch that.

30:06.071 --> 30:07.338
Yeah, look.
Just touch it, Vinny.

30:07.406 --> 30:09.174
I don't know what
the You're doing.

30:09.241 --> 30:10.475
I'm sorry, Chef.

30:10.543 --> 30:13.411
Look, a big os ass.

30:15.414 --> 30:16.915
You don't want to put up
anything in the window

30:16.982 --> 30:18.416
that's even questionable.

30:18.484 --> 30:20.185
And for him to put up
that rock-hard egg,

30:20.252 --> 30:21.619
that's not good enough.

30:21.687 --> 30:23.688
Who cooked the gnocchi?
I did, Chef.

30:23.756 --> 30:26.224
Yeah. Ah.
Crispy one side...

30:26.292 --> 30:28.326
And raw...
Raw the next.

30:28.394 --> 30:30.828
I'll fix it.
Hey...Get out!

30:30.896 --> 30:32.830
Fix your Hair!

30:32.898 --> 30:34.399
Off,
out, upstairs!

30:34.466 --> 30:36.601
Get out!
Off.

30:36.669 --> 30:39.537
Of all things, Gnocchi.
Gnocchi, of all things.

30:39.605 --> 30:42.173
Garnish is in the window.
<i>Coming to the window,</i>
<i>chicken.</i>

30:45.077 --> 30:46.811
My Head's dropping.

30:52.051 --> 30:53.251
Okay, can I
send this one?

30:53.319 --> 30:55.420
Get out, Russell!
Get out!

30:55.487 --> 30:58.056
'Cause the chicken's raw.

30:58.123 --> 31:00.558
Hey, big boy, one more
Up, you're next.

31:00.626 --> 31:01.759
Except it
may not be up there.

31:01.827 --> 31:03.161
Stay out there!

31:03.229 --> 31:04.662
Chef Ramsey's pissed.

31:04.730 --> 31:05.930
Fumin'.

31:05.998 --> 31:07.599
We're going down
in a sinking ship,

31:07.666 --> 31:09.634
and there are
no lifeboats left.

31:09.702 --> 31:12.036
Come on, let's finish
this out, Robbie.
You got it.

31:12.104 --> 31:14.038
As the remaining Chefs
in the blue kitchen

31:14.106 --> 31:15.907
try to fight back,
the Chefs on the patio...

31:15.975 --> 31:17.442
I don't Believe it.

31:17.509 --> 31:18.910
Are fighting mad.

31:18.978 --> 31:20.411
30 more seconds
in the Pan

31:20.479 --> 31:21.746
with those
Gnocchis,

31:21.814 --> 31:23.314
and I would have been
totally caught up.

31:23.382 --> 31:24.983
I made one mistake
the whole night.

31:25.050 --> 31:26.584
<i>And I got sent out because</i>

31:26.652 --> 31:28.119
I feel the wrath
from all you guys

31:28.187 --> 31:29.921
<i>getting screamed at.</i>

31:29.989 --> 31:32.023
Even though I had
a great performance today,

31:32.091 --> 31:33.191
I'm really Pissed
that I got kicked out

31:33.259 --> 31:34.726
on my first Mistake.

31:34.793 --> 31:35.793
<i>It's like a domino.</i>

31:35.861 --> 31:37.328
<i>One thing goes wrong,</i>

31:37.396 --> 31:40.665
and it's so hard
to Recover.

31:40.733 --> 31:42.233
I'm guessing it didn't
go to well for you, either.

31:42.301 --> 31:44.369
Mm-mmm.

31:44.436 --> 31:47.171
As the Chefs on the patio
continue to vent,

31:47.239 --> 31:48.806
back in the red kitchen...

31:48.874 --> 31:50.041
How long on the one
Wellington medium?

31:50.109 --> 31:52.043
Five minutes, Chef.

31:52.111 --> 31:54.112
The women make a push
for the finish line.

31:54.179 --> 31:55.847
Let's just get it, ladies!
Last two tickets after this.

31:55.914 --> 31:57.215
Come on.
And in the blue kitchen,

31:57.283 --> 31:58.983
all Chef Ramsey needs is a...

31:59.051 --> 32:00.952
Halibut!
Halibut right here!

32:03.622 --> 32:04.622
Sauce is coming.
Sorry.

32:04.690 --> 32:08.092
Sauce.

32:08.160 --> 32:08.993
<i>Sauce is ready.</i>

32:10.663 --> 32:13.498
Come here.
Get out.

32:13.565 --> 32:15.867
Get out.

32:15.934 --> 32:18.102
Huh?
Did I hear that right?

32:18.170 --> 32:20.271
Hey.
Come here.

32:20.339 --> 32:23.308
Why? 'Cause the halibut's
Raw.

32:23.375 --> 32:25.877
<i>That's why,</i>
<i>Chef Rob.</i>

32:25.944 --> 32:27.278
Get out!

32:34.162 --> 32:35.595
It's more than two hours

32:35.663 --> 32:37.097
into dinner service.

32:37.165 --> 32:38.298
Three Chefs have already
been kicked out

32:38.366 --> 32:39.933
of the kitchen.

32:40.001 --> 32:41.435
It'd be a whole lot better
if we just Shut

32:41.502 --> 32:42.669
the kitchen down.

32:42.737 --> 32:43.336
And much to Rob's confusion...

32:43.404 --> 32:44.304
Get out.

32:44.372 --> 32:45.639
Get out.

32:45.706 --> 32:47.407
He's about to join them.

32:47.475 --> 32:49.142
Hey. Why?

32:49.210 --> 32:51.011
'Cause the halibut's
Raw.

32:51.079 --> 32:52.779
<i>That's why,</i>
<i>Chef Rob.</i>

32:52.847 --> 32:54.147
Get out.

32:54.248 --> 32:56.349
Which leaves only one Chef left

32:56.417 --> 32:57.818
to complete dinner service
in the blue kitchen.

32:57.885 --> 32:59.886
And ironically...

32:59.954 --> 33:01.721
Uh.
Hi.

33:01.789 --> 33:03.523
It's Trev.

33:03.591 --> 33:05.792
Boom. The whole service
just fell on my shoulders.

33:05.860 --> 33:07.427
I'm ready.
And I have to push

33:07.495 --> 33:08.862
the fear down
and fight through it.

33:08.930 --> 33:11.932
Salmon.
Good to go.

33:11.999 --> 33:15.035
Ooh la la la la.

33:15.103 --> 33:16.837
Well done, Trev.

33:16.904 --> 33:18.872
Service.

33:18.940 --> 33:21.675
Like a big light just
kind of opened in a dark sky,

33:21.742 --> 33:23.276
and I'm getting.

33:23.344 --> 33:24.744
Trevor, jump on desserts.
Just go.

33:24.812 --> 33:26.279
Sign up
for dessert?

33:26.347 --> 33:27.681
While Trev managed to rise

33:27.748 --> 33:29.082
from the rubble
in the blue kitchen,

33:29.150 --> 33:30.851
the remaining Chefs
on the red team

33:30.918 --> 33:32.219
worked together cohesively.

33:32.286 --> 33:33.720
Coming right now, Chef.

33:33.788 --> 33:35.188
<i>Service, please.</i>

33:35.256 --> 33:36.456
And both kitchens

33:36.524 --> 33:37.390
were able
to complete dinner service.

33:37.458 --> 33:38.291
Mm-hmm.
Perfect.

33:38.359 --> 33:38.859
Me and you,
we rocked it.

33:40.795 --> 33:42.963
Well done, Trev.
Thank you, Chef.

33:43.030 --> 33:44.664
<i>I got a taste</i>
<i>of what all this is about,</i>

33:44.732 --> 33:45.298
and I want more,
believe me.

33:48.903 --> 33:51.838
Tonight
was a Disaster.

33:53.975 --> 33:56.810
Just complete disarray.

33:56.878 --> 33:59.613
We started with a total
of eight Chefs.

33:59.680 --> 34:02.349
<i>We finished with half</i>

34:02.416 --> 34:04.718
in the dorms.

34:04.785 --> 34:05.852
It's not good enough.

34:05.920 --> 34:07.988
<i>There were two Chefs</i>

34:08.054 --> 34:11.858
that stood out
in a positive manner.

34:11.926 --> 34:14.928
And they are Sabrina
and Jillian.

34:14.996 --> 34:16.530
Well done.
Thank you, Chef.

34:16.597 --> 34:18.498
Yes, Chef.
So the losing team tonight

34:18.565 --> 34:21.001
<i>on a horrible streak</i>

34:21.068 --> 34:22.668
is the blue team.

34:24.705 --> 34:26.540
By the end of service,
I had one Chef

34:26.607 --> 34:29.009
<i>left in your kitchen.</i>

34:29.076 --> 34:31.210
Best of the worst tonight,
you,

34:31.279 --> 34:32.978
<i>Trev, last man standing.</i>

34:33.047 --> 34:35.649
Glad you're back
on the men's team?

34:35.716 --> 34:38.685
Get upstairs and come up with
two nominees for elimination.

34:38.753 --> 34:39.920
<i>Think hard.</i>

34:39.987 --> 34:43.056
Now Off.

34:43.123 --> 34:44.658
Nona.
Yes, Chef.

34:44.725 --> 34:45.891
You, here.

34:48.563 --> 34:51.031
Madam,
listen carefully.

34:51.098 --> 34:54.067
I was so impressed
this morning.

34:54.135 --> 34:57.036
You've got the most important
In the crowd,

34:57.103 --> 34:59.339
and that's the palate.

34:59.407 --> 35:02.475
But it's not your job
to stand there

35:02.543 --> 35:04.644
and argue when you've done
a big Mistake.

35:04.712 --> 35:05.679
Yes, Chef.

35:05.746 --> 35:06.947
Okay?
Yes.

35:07.014 --> 35:08.982
I'm sorry
for arguing with you.

35:09.050 --> 35:10.917
It was disrespectful.
Don't forget that.

35:10.985 --> 35:13.820
Yes, Chef.

35:17.225 --> 35:18.491
I'm pissed
at myself.

35:18.559 --> 35:20.694
I'm so disappointed.

35:20.761 --> 35:22.128
I want to show
what I've got.

35:22.196 --> 35:23.563
Come here.

35:23.631 --> 35:25.765
You know, I just--
I screwed it up tonight.

35:25.833 --> 35:27.601
It's okay.
We won.

35:27.668 --> 35:30.604
You'll be all right, non.
We ain't going home.

35:30.671 --> 35:33.206
One of the boys
is gone.

35:33.274 --> 35:35.742
With Trev being named
best of the worst...

35:35.810 --> 35:37.811
Trust me. Nobody wants to be
in your shoes, bro.

35:37.878 --> 35:39.546
The men must plead their case

35:39.614 --> 35:41.615
to remain
in Hell's Kitchen.

35:41.682 --> 35:43.950
I got crucified tonight
having somebody fire.

35:44.018 --> 35:45.518
But nobody
is selling his case harder

35:45.586 --> 35:46.586
than Russell.

35:46.654 --> 35:47.821
Trevor has the biggest heart

35:47.888 --> 35:48.955
<i>and the biggest drive</i>

35:49.023 --> 35:50.991
out of all of us.

35:51.058 --> 35:52.259
The only question is,

35:52.326 --> 35:54.160
is Trev buying?

35:54.228 --> 35:55.829
You have to think
about who's gonna help you

35:55.896 --> 35:56.896
get where you need
to get.

35:56.964 --> 35:57.864
And you know
I got your back.

35:57.932 --> 35:59.099
Yeah.
You had my back.

35:59.166 --> 36:01.301
<i>I'll give you that.</i>

36:01.369 --> 36:02.869
I need another towel
for a second.

36:02.937 --> 36:03.670
You need towels?
<i>I need towels.</i>

36:03.738 --> 36:05.805
<i>I don't have one.</i>

36:05.873 --> 36:07.641
Russell's definitely selling

36:07.708 --> 36:09.843
snake oil to Trev,
and Trev is buying.

36:09.910 --> 36:12.078
I can't really look
at Russell.

36:12.146 --> 36:13.480
I don't want to Stand up
for myself.

36:13.547 --> 36:15.015
At the end of the day,

36:15.082 --> 36:15.749
I was the last one in there
with you.

36:15.816 --> 36:17.183
I know.

36:17.251 --> 36:19.152
<i>Those two got booted out.</i>

36:19.220 --> 36:20.086
<i>We could have won</i>
<i>if they were all in there,</i>

36:20.154 --> 36:21.488
and that's all I'm saying.

36:21.555 --> 36:23.657
Rob, all the fish
kept getting sent back.

36:23.724 --> 36:25.058
<i>All the fish.</i>

36:25.126 --> 36:27.193
Rob was just a Disaster
tonight.

36:27.261 --> 36:29.329
I got buried
because of Rob.

36:29.397 --> 36:32.198
Chef Ramsay told you
to think long and hard.

36:32.266 --> 36:34.367
I am.
And I'm telling you straight up,

36:34.435 --> 36:36.102
<i>Russell seems to, like, have</i>
<i>a unanimous pass.</i>

36:36.170 --> 36:38.238
That ain't fair.

36:38.306 --> 36:40.173
Russell, he likes to say,
you know, I've had your back.

36:40.241 --> 36:41.641
Let's be honest,
you know,

36:41.709 --> 36:42.909
he's absolutely
in it for himself.

36:42.977 --> 36:44.210
There's nobody that has helped
more people

36:44.278 --> 36:46.079
on our team
than me.

36:46.147 --> 36:49.015
I think I have been
an incredible team player

36:49.083 --> 36:50.884
<i>with everyone</i>
<i>the entire way through.</i>

36:50.951 --> 36:54.321
I am clearly the person
that everyone leans on.

36:54.388 --> 36:56.156
Who was the last one
in the kitchen with you?

36:56.223 --> 36:58.024
I don't know.
It's a tough decision.

36:58.092 --> 36:59.859
I don't know
what the I'm gonna do.

36:59.927 --> 37:01.795
Rob killed me
on the fish station.

37:01.862 --> 37:03.830
Vinny was dragging
on garnish.

37:03.898 --> 37:06.666
And, Russ, he's the golden boy
in our kitchen.

37:06.734 --> 37:09.936
But all he did was really yell
and scream tonight.

37:10.004 --> 37:11.338
Do what you got to do,
Trev.

37:11.405 --> 37:12.305
I don't like this,
man.

37:12.373 --> 37:13.773
What the !

37:13.841 --> 37:14.741
You got to kick somebody
to the curb.

37:28.289 --> 37:29.789
Right.
Trev.

37:29.857 --> 37:31.224
First nominee.

37:31.292 --> 37:33.693
<i>And why.</i>
First nominee...

37:35.529 --> 37:39.699
Rob.

37:42.236 --> 37:44.437
And second nominee
and why.

37:44.505 --> 37:46.506
Second nominee is...

37:57.119 --> 37:58.385
The blue team has continued

37:58.453 --> 37:59.487
its losing streak.

37:59.554 --> 38:01.088
And Chef Ramsay has asked Trev

38:01.156 --> 38:01.822
to nominate
two of his teammates

38:01.890 --> 38:03.691
for elimination.

38:03.758 --> 38:04.892
He has already made
his first selection...

38:04.960 --> 38:06.494
Rob.

38:06.561 --> 38:08.095
And must now choose
between Vinny

38:08.163 --> 38:09.230
and Russell.

38:09.297 --> 38:10.598
Second nominee
and why.

38:10.665 --> 38:12.666
Second nominee is...

38:16.938 --> 38:19.540
Russell.

38:20.709 --> 38:22.109
Russell.

38:22.177 --> 38:24.078
Reason I've put Russ up

38:24.146 --> 38:25.346
is he was supposed
to be driving the team tonight.

38:28.650 --> 38:30.451
<i>And there was a lot</i>
<i>of yelling</i>

38:30.519 --> 38:32.186
going on and stuff,
but it wasn't really motivation.

38:32.254 --> 38:34.288
<i>And to put up</i>
<i>a pink chicken</i>

38:34.356 --> 38:35.923
<i>and get kicked out,</i>

38:35.991 --> 38:37.925
it just--it let me down
a little bit personally.

38:41.163 --> 38:44.765
Okay, Russell and Rob,
step forward.

38:50.872 --> 38:52.673
Okay.
Russell.

38:52.741 --> 38:55.843
I never expect
a Chef of your caliber

38:55.911 --> 38:58.779
to send me pink chicken.

38:58.847 --> 39:00.314
I did everything right
tonight,

39:00.382 --> 39:02.383
and then
it all went downhill

39:02.450 --> 39:04.618
in one fell swoop,
and I take full responsibility

39:04.686 --> 39:05.953
<i>for that.</i>
<i>I'm concerned.</i>

39:06.021 --> 39:07.221
<i>There are cracks appearing,</i>

39:07.289 --> 39:12.092
and they are getting wider.

39:12.160 --> 39:13.761
<i>Rob,</i>

39:13.828 --> 39:16.230
you tell me why you think you
should stay in Hell's Kitchen.

39:16.298 --> 39:18.098
Chef, I've walked
to the end tonight.

39:18.166 --> 39:19.466
I was one of the last Chefs
in the kitchen.

39:19.534 --> 39:20.868
I mean, yeah, I was
a little slow out of the gate

39:20.936 --> 39:22.203
with the scallops,
and I'll admit that,

39:22.270 --> 39:23.704
I'll take ownership for that,

39:23.772 --> 39:24.705
but I don't think
I was the worst Chef

39:24.773 --> 39:26.674
in the kitchen tonight.

39:26.741 --> 39:28.976
Who was the worst Chef
in the kitchen tonight?

39:29.044 --> 39:31.011
It's hard to say. I think
it was a team effort on that.

39:31.079 --> 39:32.913
You're avoiding
the question.

39:32.981 --> 39:36.550
So if you're not telling me
who is the worst Chef

39:36.618 --> 39:39.119
<i>in the blue team,</i>
<i>then I presume it's you.</i>

39:39.187 --> 39:42.089
It's not, Chef, because I was
there to the end fighting,

39:42.157 --> 39:43.924
<i>and you saw that.</i>
<i>Let's do it this way.</i>

39:43.992 --> 39:46.026
Are you a better Chef
than Russell?

39:46.094 --> 39:48.128
Yes, I am. I believe I am.
No, he's not.

39:48.196 --> 39:49.630
If he doesn't think so,
whatever, I do.

39:53.168 --> 39:54.368
<i>Okay...</i>

39:56.538 --> 39:59.373
My decision is...

40:00.976 --> 40:01.809
Russell.

40:05.981 --> 40:08.315
Wow.

40:08.383 --> 40:09.683
Back in line.

40:09.751 --> 40:12.253
Rob, give me your jacket.

40:12.320 --> 40:13.954
<i>You've outstayed your welcome,</i>
<i>big boy.</i>

40:14.022 --> 40:14.788
I can't--
I can't put up with it.

40:14.856 --> 40:16.090
<i>Thank you, Rob.</i>

40:19.060 --> 40:20.160
Sorry you feel that way.

40:20.228 --> 40:21.295
Thanks for the opportunity.

40:21.363 --> 40:22.162
Thank you.
Take care.

40:22.230 --> 40:24.465
Good night.

40:28.370 --> 40:30.437
You know, I had
a one in seven shot

40:30.505 --> 40:32.306
at this point
to win the prize,

40:32.374 --> 40:34.375
and I'm just pissed
I didn't make it further.

40:34.442 --> 40:36.510
It's unfortunate,
because I think the wrong guy

40:36.578 --> 40:38.078
went home tonight,
but I guess everybody says that.

40:38.146 --> 40:40.214
Gentlemen,

40:40.282 --> 40:41.448
get a grip, guys,
yeah?

40:41.516 --> 40:42.916
Yes, Chef.

40:42.984 --> 40:44.718
Time, right now,
is not your friend.

40:44.786 --> 40:46.353
<i>Four versus three.</i>

40:46.421 --> 40:47.921
Here's the worry.

40:47.989 --> 40:49.657
The final four could be
all female.

40:51.826 --> 40:53.327
Now Off.

40:55.063 --> 41:00.868
I cannot believe
that Trev did that to Russell.

41:00.935 --> 41:03.404
The blue team
is self-destructing.

41:03.471 --> 41:04.938
They are falling apart
at the seams.

41:05.006 --> 41:05.973
Wow.
Throwing me under the bus.

41:07.442 --> 41:08.475
Didn't throw you
under the bus.

41:08.543 --> 41:10.110
Just got dirty.

41:10.178 --> 41:11.779
Did not throw you
under the bus.

41:11.846 --> 41:13.881
It just got grimy,
bro.

41:13.948 --> 41:16.317
You really Up
tonight, Trevor.

41:16.384 --> 41:18.052
You put me up there,
bro,

41:18.119 --> 41:21.021
I came out alive,
and you are in so much trouble.

41:21.089 --> 41:23.490
Watch out, because I am going
to Bury you.

41:26.428 --> 41:27.961
If the size of one's waist
corresponds

41:28.029 --> 41:29.363
to the size of one's talent,

41:29.431 --> 41:31.131
then Rob would be
c Chef.

41:31.199 --> 41:34.068
Instead, he just wears
gigantic pants.

41:39.541 --> 41:41.842
The winner of <i>Hell's Kitchen</i>
will become head Chef

41:41.910 --> 41:43.110
of the brand-new,
multimillion-dollar restaurant

41:43.178 --> 41:45.813
la market
at the JW Marriott Hotel

41:45.880 --> 41:47.247
in downtown Los Angeles...

41:47.315 --> 41:49.249
The salary--
$1/4 million.

41:51.286 --> 41:53.454
And they will also tour
the country

41:53.521 --> 41:55.823
as the official spokesperson
of Rosemount Estate winery.

41:55.890 --> 41:58.292
Next time
on <i>Hell's Kitchen,</i>

41:58.360 --> 42:00.594
some Chefs have been waiting
to play their hand.

42:00.662 --> 42:02.363
I think there might be
a changing in a guard.

42:02.430 --> 42:04.365
It might be my turn
to lead.

42:04.432 --> 42:05.766
But with the black jackets
in sight...

42:05.834 --> 42:07.267
We're at seven people
right now.

42:07.335 --> 42:08.335
We have to get down
to six.

42:08.403 --> 42:10.003
Someone's gonna be going home.

42:10.071 --> 42:11.271
The time for waiting is over.

42:11.339 --> 42:12.873
It's now or never.
Ah!

42:12.941 --> 42:14.108
To make it to the final six,

42:14.175 --> 42:15.542
these Chefs put their hearts...

42:15.610 --> 42:17.277
You're not gonna [Bleak me.

42:17.345 --> 42:18.912
Let's go, Trev!

42:18.980 --> 42:20.280
Souls...

42:20.348 --> 42:21.515
I got no place else to go.

42:21.583 --> 42:22.883
I have to win.

42:22.951 --> 42:24.485
And bodies on the line.

42:24.552 --> 42:26.053
<i>Oh, no!</i>

42:26.121 --> 42:28.188
I burned my hand.
That's why I dropped it.

42:28.256 --> 42:29.923
And while dinner service

42:29.991 --> 42:31.525
is one
of the most intense ever...

42:31.593 --> 42:32.626
What the
Is going on?

42:32.694 --> 42:34.328
The bass is raw!

42:36.664 --> 42:38.365
You won't believe...

42:38.433 --> 42:39.967
Oh, you got to be
Kidding me.

42:40.034 --> 42:41.135
What happens...

42:41.202 --> 42:42.636
<i>Who should not make it</i>

42:42.704 --> 42:43.504
to the final six?
At elimination.

42:43.571 --> 42:44.905
He didn't pull his weigh tonight.

42:44.973 --> 42:46.340
I don't think a 22-year-old
is going to be able

42:46.408 --> 42:47.975
to run LA Market.

42:48.042 --> 42:50.010
<i>His attitude sucks.</i>

42:50.078 --> 42:51.345
Find out who makes
the final six...

42:51.413 --> 42:53.614
I've got one jacket here.
Who wants it?

42:53.681 --> 42:56.326
Next time on <i>Hell's Kitchen.</i>
