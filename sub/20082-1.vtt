05:30.456 --> 05:33.042
<i>London.</i>

05:53.785 --> 05:56.086
<i>Heil Hitler!</i>

05:59.576 --> 06:01.584
<i>Doktor.</i>

06:46.074 --> 06:48.725
<i>Captain Alan Thorndike, Engländer.</i>

06:48.794 --> 06:52.985
<i>T- H-O-R-N-D-I-K-E.</i>

06:53.052 --> 06:55.059
<i>K- E.</i>

07:19.676 --> 07:23.539
<i>Langsam. Langsam.</i>

07:39.868 --> 07:41.875
Please be seated, Captain Thorndike.

07:46.429 --> 07:48.796
Thank you.

07:56.893 --> 07:58.900
Have a cigarette.

08:00.349 --> 08:02.651
Thank you.

08:02.717 --> 08:06.776
You know, if you just walked up to
this house in a normal way, instead of, uh-

08:08.351 --> 08:12.028
you would've been invited
to lunch by our führer.

08:12.095 --> 08:15.411
I've anticipated the pleasure
of meeting you for years.

08:16.862 --> 08:18.804
I'm afraid I don't know-

08:18.878 --> 08:22.173
Like you, my dear Thorndike,
I had but one passion in life...

08:22.239 --> 08:24.442
and that is the hunting of big game.

08:24.511 --> 08:27.063
I'm convinced that I would've
become more famous even than yourself...

08:27.134 --> 08:30.233
if I hadn't renounced it
in favor of politics.

08:30.302 --> 08:32.244
Politics?

08:32.318 --> 08:35.832
Yes, I, uh, find it a more exciting
field of action-

08:35.903 --> 08:38.357
my branch of it.

08:38.431 --> 08:41.082
You're surprised that
I know your name so well.

08:41.150 --> 08:45.275
I was in Nairobi on my own safari the year
that all Kenya rang with your exploits.

08:45.344 --> 08:48.344
So you see, it's quite natural that
I should know who you are.

08:48.416 --> 08:50.969
Yes.

08:51.040 --> 08:54.422
And also you've taken, uh...

08:54.495 --> 08:56.437
my passport.

08:56.511 --> 08:59.708
Nonetheless, my dear Thorndike,
I should've recognized you on sight-

08:59.776 --> 09:02.427
a man whose brother was a guest
in this house only last September.

09:02.496 --> 09:04.733
So you know my brother?

09:04.800 --> 09:08.182
When Lord Risborough was sent here by
your prime minister on a mission of appeasement.

09:10.784 --> 09:12.824
I found him a credulous simpleton.

09:15.680 --> 09:19.095
Do you know, Thorndike, that this is
the most closely guarded house in the world?

09:20.192 --> 09:22.102
Rather.

09:22.177 --> 09:24.185
I would've staked my life
that no living thing...

09:24.257 --> 09:27.453
could've entered this area
without being seen.

09:27.521 --> 09:29.856
But then, of course,
we didn't count upon a creature...

09:29.921 --> 09:32.157
that has learned to stalk
the most cunning animal...

09:32.226 --> 09:34.265
that can catch scents
upon the Wind...

09:34.337 --> 09:38.527
that has mastered the trick of moving
through a forest as if he were transparent.

09:38.594 --> 09:42.074
Look out there.
For 500 yards, not a tree, not a shrub.

09:42.145 --> 09:46.618
A man running towards this house would
be cut down before he'd taken five steps.

09:48.258 --> 09:50.843
And yet on that ledge above...

09:50.914 --> 09:53.053
was a man with a precision rifle...

09:53.122 --> 09:57.017
and a High degree of intelligence
and skill that is required to use it.

09:58.434 --> 10:01.730
Your judgment of distance
is uncanny, Thorndike.

10:01.794 --> 10:06.267
The sights were set at 550 yards,
only 10 feet short of the exact range.

10:06.339 --> 10:08.346
I checked it.

10:12.643 --> 10:17.913
Obviously, my dear Thorndike,
such a man cannot be allowed to live.

10:19.139 --> 10:22.238
Surely you don't think
I'm an assassin.

10:22.308 --> 10:24.609
You were stopped
before you could shoot.

10:24.676 --> 10:27.163
But I could have easily.

10:27.235 --> 10:30.552
<i>Good heavens, man,
I never Intended to shoot.</i>

10:30.627 --> 10:33.595
I merely wanted to find out
if it were possible.

10:33.668 --> 10:36.482
That was the excitement of it-
the danger, the fun.

10:36.548 --> 10:39.712
It was that fellow jumping me
that made my gun go off.

10:39.780 --> 10:41.788
You disappoint me, Thorndike.

10:43.525 --> 10:45.761
I daresay I have been a bit thick...

10:45.828 --> 10:49.276
but, well, from the way you talked
about hunting and all that...

10:49.348 --> 10:52.031
I assumed you knew
it was a sporting stalk.

10:52.100 --> 10:54.272
A what?

10:54.341 --> 10:58.978
A sporting stalk. Stalking the game
you're after for the fun of it- not to kill.

11:00.356 --> 11:02.364
Oh, I'm not begging off
from any consequences...

11:02.437 --> 11:06.114
but you will permit me to doubt
your claims as a hunter of big game...

11:06.181 --> 11:10.207
if you fail to understand the fascination
for a man who's hunted all commoner game...

11:10.277 --> 11:12.416
of hunting the biggest game
on Earth.

11:12.485 --> 11:14.656
That's it. Precisely.

11:14.725 --> 11:17.627
The most dangerous
of all animals- man.

11:17.701 --> 11:21.891
But you don't kill.
The sport is in the chase, not the kill.

11:21.957 --> 11:24.805
I don't kill any longer,
not even small game.

11:24.869 --> 11:27.619
<i>I know what I can do with a rifle.</i>

11:27.687 --> 11:31.942
If I can stalk an animal and get within range,
the rest is a mathematical certainty.

11:32.006 --> 11:34.853
And that's sheer cruelty,
and I don't like cruelty.

11:34.918 --> 11:38.595
The real fun is matching my wits
against the instinct of an animal...

11:38.662 --> 11:40.996
<i>that Isn't going to let me
get near enough to shoot.</i>

11:41.062 --> 11:43.844
Your conversation
fascinates me, Thorndike.

11:43.911 --> 11:48.253
But this softness in your nature with
regard to the ultimate purpose of firearms...

11:48.326 --> 11:53.215
betrays the weakness, the decadence,
not only of yourself but of your entire race.

11:53.287 --> 11:56.254
Yes, you're symbolic
of the English race.

11:56.327 --> 11:58.237
I'm beginning to think that
you're symbolic of yours.

11:58.312 --> 12:00.962
We Nazis are finding a new life,
a new vitality for our people...

12:01.031 --> 12:02.973
by returning to
the primitive virtues.

12:03.047 --> 12:05.219
Such as going back
to the barbarism of decapitation?

12:05.287 --> 12:08.483
We do not hesitate to destroy
in order to create a new world.

12:08.551 --> 12:10.690
God help it.
I'm sorry for you.

12:10.759 --> 12:13.890
And I for you, Thorndike-
you and your world.

12:18.568 --> 12:20.870
<i>- Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler!</i>

12:36.808 --> 12:38.783
<i>Heil Hitler!</i>

12:52.681 --> 12:54.688
You will leave this country
a free man.

12:54.761 --> 12:57.608
You can return to your position and
friends in spite of what you've done.

12:57.673 --> 13:00.673
- On what condition?
- Your name signed to this.

13:00.745 --> 13:04.487
Later, it will be witnessed by the chief
of secret police and other officials.

13:04.554 --> 13:07.554
What is it? A suicide note?

13:10.986 --> 13:14.531
It is a confession that on
this 29th day of July, 1939...

13:14.602 --> 13:16.774
you have attempted to
assassinate our führer...

13:16.842 --> 13:21.032
and that you have undertaken this crime
with the approval of your government.

13:23.306 --> 13:25.248
I what?

13:25.322 --> 13:27.972
That you have acted
as an assassin for the British government.

13:28.042 --> 13:32.265
I can't believe you're serious.
Do you expect me to sign a lie?

13:32.331 --> 13:34.568
- You still insist you had no intention to shoot?
- Of course.

13:34.635 --> 13:36.577
I told you it was a sporting stalk.

13:36.651 --> 13:40.328
- Then why didn't you leave your rifle behind?
- Uh-

13:40.395 --> 13:42.883
I've asked myself that.

13:42.955 --> 13:46.272
And I think the answer is that-

13:46.347 --> 13:49.892
that it wouldn't have been sporting,
it wouldn't have been playing the game.

13:49.963 --> 13:54.338
Nothing betrays the hypocrisy of the English
more than their use of ‘‘playing the game. "

13:54.411 --> 13:57.095
- One plays a game to win, Thorndike.
- Nonsense.

13:57.163 --> 13:59.465
I don't expect you to understand.

13:59.532 --> 14:02.434
Even pulling the trigger
on an empty gun was a-

14:02.508 --> 14:04.680
oh, a kind of cheating with myself.

14:04.748 --> 14:08.610
- It-It didn't prove anything. I did, you know?
- Oh, naturally.

14:08.684 --> 14:12.808
It had to be a loaded rifle
with my finger on the trigger...

14:12.876 --> 14:15.723
with only my individual will,
my civilized conscience...

14:15.788 --> 14:19.050
- between me and the extermination of your strutting little Caesar.
- Thorndike!

14:19.116 --> 14:23.241
I mean no insult, but how do you expect me
to describe a man who wants to play God...

14:23.309 --> 14:25.960
<i>and have everyone else in the world
run around and say, ‘‘Heil Hitler"?</i>

14:26.029 --> 14:28.775
- Thorndike, I warn you.
- Oh, no, thank you.

14:47.342 --> 14:49.349
Oh.

14:51.662 --> 14:53.604
For the last time,
will you sign this document?

14:53.678 --> 14:56.777
You are in no position to refuse.

14:56.846 --> 14:59.267
That's for me to decide, isn't it?

14:59.342 --> 15:01.611
You're thinking it is easy
to throw away your life.

15:01.678 --> 15:04.134
Yes, it is.

15:04.206 --> 15:09.258
But, uh, how well do you stand pain?

15:09.326 --> 15:12.622
If you won't listen to me,
you'll have to talk it over with these men.

15:12.687 --> 15:15.557
I would save you from their persuasion.

15:17.583 --> 15:21.511
Very well.

15:59.792 --> 16:04.681
Tell him His Excellency, the German
ambassador, desires to speak with him.

16:06.161 --> 16:08.168
Of course he was there, sir-
all the time.

16:10.321 --> 16:13.736
- The German ambassador is on the telephone, my lord.
- What?

16:13.809 --> 16:17.038
Has a man no privacy even in his own home
in the middle of the night?

16:17.105 --> 16:19.822
I told him I would see
if you were still up, my lord.

16:19.889 --> 16:22.410
Oh, very well, very well.

16:22.481 --> 16:25.677
Hello. Hello.

16:25.745 --> 16:29.772
Yes, Risborough Speaking.
Uh, good evening, Your Excellency.

16:29.842 --> 16:32.842
A pleasure, I assure you.

16:32.914 --> 16:36.526
I heard some rumor that Captain Thorndike
is visiting our country.

16:36.594 --> 16:40.685
I'm sure I don't know, Your Excellency.
Have you called his club?

16:40.754 --> 16:46.384
I wish to telegraph my friends in Berlin
to see that he's taken care of properly.

16:49.394 --> 16:53.454
We cannot, of course, neglect any member
of Your LordShip's family.

16:53.523 --> 16:58.738
It's extremely gracious of Your Excellency,
but I'm sure you're mistaken.

16:58.803 --> 17:00.811
I haven't seen him for weeks.

17:00.883 --> 17:03.435
Sportsman, you know.

17:03.506 --> 17:08.209
Always running off to the end of the world
to catch a fish or some such nonsense.

17:08.275 --> 17:11.406
I'm positive he's not on the Continent.

17:11.474 --> 17:16.079
He may be on his ranch in Canada.
Spends a lot of time there.

17:16.146 --> 17:18.155
Not at all. Not at all.

17:18.228 --> 17:21.042
Why, a great pleasure, I assure you.

17:22.612 --> 17:27.598
The man is a fool,
but absolutely honest.

17:27.667 --> 17:30.155
The gestapo are a pack of-

17:31.828 --> 17:34.828
- Send this message to Berchtesgaden.
- Yes, sir.

17:36.276 --> 17:39.211
I should hesitate to
question the efficiency...

17:39.283 --> 17:41.967
of the gestapo agent...

17:42.036 --> 17:45.136
who claims to be holding Thorndike.

17:45.205 --> 17:49.328
But after my conversation
with Lord Risborough...

17:49.397 --> 17:54.131
I am convinced Thorndike
cannot possibly be your man.

17:54.197 --> 17:57.513
‘‘Clearly a case of mistaken identity.

17:57.589 --> 18:01.266
<i>Always glad to be of service. " Idiot.</i>

18:24.053 --> 18:27.349
<i>Doktor.</i>

19:01.656 --> 19:03.630
Thorndike.

19:04.760 --> 19:08.535
<i>Thorndike!</i>

19:08.600 --> 19:11.447
You're being exasperatingly
stubborn.

19:11.512 --> 19:14.643
You must realize that
this cannot Continue much longer.

19:14.712 --> 19:17.429
Are you ready to sign?

19:21.047 --> 19:24.529
Believe me, my dear fellow,
I don't want you to die.

19:28.153 --> 19:32.463
- Just sign your name and it'll be
important for us that you live.

19:32.537 --> 19:34.446
You will receive the best
of medical treatment.

19:34.521 --> 19:37.783
You will be free to go home,
free to live on that fine estate of yours...

19:37.849 --> 19:40.783
free to do anything you like,
except to leave England.

19:44.761 --> 19:47.576
Are you being so foolish as to
imagine yourself a martyr for England?

19:47.642 --> 19:50.325
Is that why you refuse?

19:50.394 --> 19:52.663
<i>- No.
- Why refuse then?</i>

19:52.729 --> 19:54.802
Why keep on torturing yourself?

19:54.874 --> 19:58.169
<i>Because I don't llke force.</i>

19:58.233 --> 20:02.325
<i>You force your own people
to keep In line, and...</i>

20:03.674 --> 20:05.616
<i>you think you can force
everyone else.</i>

20:05.690 --> 20:09.487
<i>Well, I'm one man saylng you can't.</i>

20:10.938 --> 20:12.946
<i>As you wish.</i>

20:13.019 --> 20:16.052
I'm not responsible for your suffering.

20:16.122 --> 20:18.937
You are, in fact, taking your own life.

20:24.731 --> 20:28.560
<i>That's going to be hard
to explain, Isn't It?</i>

20:28.635 --> 20:32.247
<i>- What is?
- My suicide.</i>

20:32.315 --> 20:35.129
<i>Lots of questions going to be asked.</i>

20:36.282 --> 20:40.473
<i>- High places.
- High places.</i>

20:43.292 --> 20:47.034
That's one place where
no questions will be asked.

20:47.099 --> 20:50.547
You've given me the key
I've been searching for.

20:51.836 --> 20:53.778
You won't change your mind
about this?

20:53.852 --> 20:56.951
<i>- Certainly not.
- Very well.</i>

20:57.020 --> 21:01.176
Identification is essential
in the High places.

21:01.243 --> 21:04.627
We'll give you back your passport
and your wallet, clean you up and-

21:04.701 --> 21:09.108
<i>Doktor.</i>

22:02.783 --> 22:04.758
<i>Doktor.</i>

22:22.016 --> 22:24.634
There are people in England that...

22:24.704 --> 22:28.479
know that men of my character
don't do this sort of thing.

22:28.544 --> 22:31.839
Men of your character
have accidents.

22:31.903 --> 22:34.456
Tomorrow the Doktor and I
will go hunting.

22:34.527 --> 22:38.389
No one will question what we find
when we've found it.

22:38.463 --> 22:41.245
This ledge is treacherous.

27:33.579 --> 27:36.329
<i>The skipper ought to be back by now...</i>

27:36.395 --> 27:38.468
<i>If we're going to sail tonight.</i>

27:38.540 --> 27:41.387
<i>Right you are, sir.</i>

27:52.748 --> 27:56.425
If the blighters don't let us sail pretty soon,
we might as well all go ashore.

28:00.076 --> 28:02.531
- Good night.
- Good night.

28:31.757 --> 28:34.092
I say.

28:44.270 --> 28:46.245
<i>Ah, sein Paß.</i>

28:50.734 --> 28:53.996
My word. You seem to be
knocked about a bit.

28:55.374 --> 28:57.382
Yeah.

28:59.023 --> 29:01.260
Would you mind closing that door?

29:04.015 --> 29:07.757
- This is a British Ship, isn't it?
- Danish registry.

29:07.824 --> 29:11.085
- But you're British.
- Rather.

29:11.151 --> 29:15.210
Cabin boy. My father does business
with the captain out of Southampton.

29:15.279 --> 29:19.141
- I'm British too.
- Oh, I'd know you were British anywhere, sir.

29:20.751 --> 29:23.240
You seem to be in a bit of trouble, sir.

29:23.312 --> 29:27.892
Oh, more than a bit, I'm afraid.

29:31.093 --> 29:33.711
Have you committed a crime, sir?

29:33.780 --> 29:36.147
No.

29:36.212 --> 29:38.416
Was it, um...

29:39.796 --> 29:41.706
about a woman?

29:43.380 --> 29:47.090
I see you know life.

29:47.157 --> 29:49.362
I thought so.

29:49.430 --> 29:51.437
They're a dickens of a problem,
aren't they, sir?

29:56.054 --> 29:58.836
- Where are you bound?
- East India Docks, London.

29:58.901 --> 30:01.651
- And when are you sailing?
- Tonight, if we can get permission.

30:13.175 --> 30:15.346
This way, sir.
Quick!

30:18.902 --> 30:21.390
Come on, sir.
This way, sir.

30:21.463 --> 30:25.936
Hurry. Come on.
Come on! Come on!

30:27.254 --> 30:30.189
Hurry, sir. Come on.

30:36.375 --> 30:39.889
Oh, it's no use.
I haven't got the strength.

30:46.519 --> 30:48.527
They're coming!

30:50.583 --> 30:54.128
Quick. In here.

31:11.704 --> 31:13.711
Vaner!

31:17.464 --> 31:19.471
Vaner!

31:25.016 --> 31:26.958
<i>Donnerwetter.</i>

31:27.032 --> 31:29.008
Sorry, sir. I was belowdecks.

31:29.081 --> 31:32.212
Call your First mate. You c-

31:32.281 --> 31:36.209
Ah, there you are.
Already we waste two days.

31:36.281 --> 31:38.932
- We sail tonight as soon as these policemen search the Ship.
- Good.

31:39.001 --> 31:40.911
- Show them everything.
- Yeah.

31:40.985 --> 31:42.927
Then I get clearance, no?

31:43.001 --> 31:44.911
<i>- Danke.
- You will want to start belowdecks?</i>

31:44.986 --> 31:47.768
- Yes.
- This way, please.

31:47.833 --> 31:50.451
- Wait. I'll come with you.
- I'll take your coat, sir.

31:50.521 --> 31:53.588
- You might need it. It's cold on deck.
- You think so? All Right.

31:53.658 --> 31:55.862
Come. Come along.

32:15.066 --> 32:19.322
Only my own cabin you didn't search.
Is it not?

32:19.387 --> 32:21.722
Wait. Away, boy. Away.
I don't need you.

32:21.787 --> 32:24.056
Please. Go away.

32:27.899 --> 32:31.696
Maybe you think I would
hide stowaways, huh?

32:40.379 --> 32:44.853
Or maybe you think I hide
somebody under the mattress, no?

32:49.884 --> 32:52.153
<i>So, now we will sail, Is It not?</i>

32:52.220 --> 32:54.359
<i>- Certainly, Herr Kapitän.
- Danke.</i>

32:54.428 --> 32:57.079
<i>We only do our duty.
Herr Kapitän surely understands.</i>

32:57.149 --> 33:00.215
Certainly. Vaner.

33:00.284 --> 33:03.186
- Yes, sir.
- Tell the First mate we sail at once.

33:03.261 --> 33:05.682
Yes, sir.

33:05.756 --> 33:09.718
<i>Herr Kapitän, uh,
can you take a passenger?</i>

33:09.789 --> 33:13.084
Passenger? You mean he will pay?

33:13.149 --> 33:15.157
He has papers?

33:15.229 --> 33:18.459
He is English, but you
need have no doubt about him.

33:18.525 --> 33:20.696
His papers are in order,
and he has money.

33:20.765 --> 33:23.067
<i>Oh, here he is.</i>

33:27.485 --> 33:32.407
May I present, Captain Jensen,
Mr. Thorndike.

33:32.478 --> 33:34.867
- It's a pleasure, sir.
- How do you do?

33:34.943 --> 33:38.837
I'm not averse to paying whatever
you demand for my passage, Captain.

33:38.910 --> 33:42.041
You see, I have urgent business
in London.

33:42.110 --> 33:45.078
This is my passport, Captain.

34:41.024 --> 34:43.097
<i>Have I surprised you, Mr. Vaner?</i>

34:43.168 --> 34:45.371
I thought I saw you go ashore, sir.

34:45.440 --> 34:50.362
Ah, yes. But I forgot
to say good-bye to the captain.

34:50.433 --> 34:52.440
But he's not here?

34:52.513 --> 34:54.684
Captain Jensen's on deck, sir.

34:54.753 --> 34:58.015
He's going ashore with the cargo manifest.
You may miss him if you wait here.

34:58.081 --> 35:00.056
Ah, yes.

35:05.889 --> 35:09.915
It's easy to miss a man
aboard Ship now, isn't it, Mr. Vaner?

35:16.514 --> 35:21.729
Oh, I thought you leave us when you told me
good-bye. You forget something, yes?

35:21.794 --> 35:25.089
I'm a very forgetful man, Captain.
Always forgetting the obvious.

35:25.154 --> 35:28.220
- It's my failing.
- Come. I take you ashore with me.

35:28.290 --> 35:30.745
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

36:00.451 --> 36:03.038
Hello.

36:21.956 --> 36:24.257
Isn't this going to get you
into trouble?

36:24.324 --> 36:26.233
Oh, probably, sir, but I don't mind.

36:26.308 --> 36:29.342
It won't be the First time the First mate
and I have had our differences.

36:35.109 --> 36:38.306
I don't think you ought
to leave the Ship yet, sir.

36:38.373 --> 36:41.439
Stop worrying, my boy.
This is England. I'm home again.

36:41.509 --> 36:43.680
But I didn't like the looks
of that walking corpse.

36:43.749 --> 36:46.171
Kept sniffing around the whole voyage.

36:46.245 --> 36:49.857
From the way you described him, I've never
laid eyes on the man or he on me.

36:49.925 --> 36:52.129
Smell that London air.

36:52.197 --> 36:55.908
I'm not worrying anymore,
thank heaven. Thanks to you.

36:57.734 --> 37:03.102
You know, Vaner, there are some things
that words can't express.

37:03.173 --> 37:06.021
And just between us men...

37:06.086 --> 37:09.763
I don't know how to thank you,
so I'm not going to try.

37:09.830 --> 37:13.147
- You've taken me on trust, my boy.
- Of course, sir.

37:15.558 --> 37:17.664
Ah, thank you.

37:18.727 --> 37:21.924
- Just one thing, sir.
- Huh?

37:23.175 --> 37:25.564
It wasn't a woman, was it, sir?

37:25.639 --> 37:28.225
- No.
- I thought so.

37:31.687 --> 37:36.127
- Good luck, sir, and be careful.
- Thank you.

37:36.199 --> 37:38.370
Would you mind seeing
if the coast is clear?

37:41.927 --> 37:44.645
- All Right.
- Good-bye, old boy.

38:31.433 --> 38:34.565
<i>?It's the same the whole world over?</i>

38:34.633 --> 38:38.146
<i>?It's the poor what gets the blame?</i>

38:38.217 --> 38:41.349
? While the rich has all the pleasures?

38:41.418 --> 38:45.509
? Now ain't that a blinkin' shame?

38:45.578 --> 38:49.091
? She was a just a parson's daughter?

38:52.490 --> 38:54.562
I say, what Ship, matey?

38:54.634 --> 38:57.220
<i>Uh, the, uh- the Lifeline.</i>

38:57.290 --> 39:00.225
- Well, welcome home.
- Thanks, old chap.

39:32.076 --> 39:35.043
- Taxi, sir?
- Yes.

39:40.556 --> 39:43.109
<i>Back up! Follow him!</i>

41:28.144 --> 41:29.868
Don't open the door.

41:29.937 --> 41:32.238
- Let me go. What you doin' here?
- Shh!

41:32.305 --> 41:33.733
<i>- Let me go!
- Quiet.</i>

41:33.808 --> 41:36.263
Let me go or I'll call the co-

42:17.331 --> 42:20.560
Oh, thank you, my dear.
You saved my life.

42:20.627 --> 42:23.823
Saved your life?

42:23.890 --> 42:26.029
Here, who are you anyway?

42:26.099 --> 42:29.415
Well, I was laboring under the delusion
that I was a carefree man...

42:29.490 --> 42:34.225
returning home for the fatted calf,
and now I realize I am the fatted calf.

42:34.290 --> 42:36.592
Wish you'd say things
I can understand.

42:36.659 --> 42:39.626
Uh, have you got a cigarette?

42:39.698 --> 42:41.608
Thank you very much.

42:41.682 --> 42:43.626
Who are them blokes
what are after you?

42:43.699 --> 42:46.733
You won't believe me when I tell you
I've never before laid eyes on them.

42:46.804 --> 42:49.073
How do you know
they're after you then?

42:49.140 --> 42:52.882
When one's been hunted, my dear child,
one develops instincts. It's amazing.

42:52.947 --> 42:54.857
Did you commit a murder?

42:54.932 --> 42:58.958
Mm-mmm. However, I suspect
that something of that nature...

42:59.028 --> 43:02.094
was about to be committed
when you came to the rescue of the victim.

43:02.164 --> 43:05.459
So, uh, once again,
my dear, thank you.

43:05.523 --> 43:09.102
Your memory will be imperishable
as long as I live.

43:09.173 --> 43:12.588
And, uh, just how long that will be
depends again on you.

43:12.661 --> 43:15.694
Now see here. I ain't gettin'
mixed up in nothin'. I can tell you that.

43:15.765 --> 43:19.442
Heaven forbid. The last thing in the world
I want to do is involve an innocent.

43:19.508 --> 43:23.021
But I need the loan of a few shillings.
Uh, a pound, if you have it.

43:23.093 --> 43:25.100
Ah. You talks like a gentleman...

43:25.172 --> 43:27.660
but gents don't go around
askin' girls for money.

43:27.733 --> 43:30.799
You've probably never before
entertained a desperate gentleman.

43:30.869 --> 43:33.717
I've simply got to get to
my brother's house in Grosvenor Gardens.

43:33.782 --> 43:36.203
Grosvenor Gardens?
Go on.

43:38.165 --> 43:40.816
It should be obvious that
I can't get that far on foot...

43:40.885 --> 43:42.892
especially with
these other gentlemen in the street.

43:42.965 --> 43:45.933
I need a cab. I may have to
change to sundry other cabs.

43:46.005 --> 43:49.780
And, uh, unfortunately,
when I left my private yacht...

43:49.845 --> 43:51.787
I neglected to put
a stiver in my pocket.

43:51.861 --> 43:54.382
I am for the moment
absolutely penniless.

43:54.454 --> 43:56.396
Come off it.

43:57.431 --> 44:00.213
I, uh, see you don't trust me.

44:02.326 --> 44:04.149
Well...

44:05.687 --> 44:09.135
allow me to thank you at any rate
for the great service you've done me.

44:09.207 --> 44:11.214
I shall have to risk it on foot.

44:22.616 --> 44:25.169
- Bye.
- Half a mo.

44:26.775 --> 44:30.485
Will-Will 10 bob do?

44:32.312 --> 44:35.029
It's all I got.

44:39.255 --> 44:41.808
To lend all you've got
is a pretty big loan.

44:43.255 --> 44:45.677
Unless something unavoidable
happens to me...

44:45.752 --> 44:48.884
you shall get this back
with tenfold interest.

45:26.426 --> 45:28.335
- I'm going with you.
- Oh, no.

45:28.409 --> 45:30.351
I ain't afraid!
You can't stop me.

45:30.426 --> 45:33.459
- You're coming to make sure you get your money, is that it?
- Right.

45:33.529 --> 45:37.327
You wait here where you're safe.
I'll get a cabbie who's a pal of mine.

45:53.946 --> 45:56.313
Don't stand there coughing, Reeves.
What is it?

45:56.378 --> 45:59.761
- It's Mr. Alan, my lord.
- Mr. Alan?

45:59.834 --> 46:02.223
Yes, with a young lady, my lord.

46:02.299 --> 46:05.616
Gerald, old boy. Bless my soul,
it's good to see you.

46:05.692 --> 46:08.113
Alice, my dear.

46:08.187 --> 46:11.057
Alan! Your face. This scar.

46:11.131 --> 46:15.507
Oh, those revolting clothes.
What has happened to you?

46:15.579 --> 46:18.165
- Allow me to shake your hand too, Reeves.
- Oh.

46:18.235 --> 46:20.504
<i>Alan. Come In my study.</i>

46:20.571 --> 46:23.805
I must see you alone...
immediately.

46:23.933 --> 46:27.960
Don't be so impatient, Gerald.
I feel like shaking hands with everybody.

46:28.030 --> 46:29.939
How are you, Reeves?

46:30.014 --> 46:32.829
And you, sir.
How are you?

46:35.966 --> 46:38.683
Oh, Alice.

46:38.750 --> 46:41.750
Allow me to present
a very dear friend of mine.

46:41.822 --> 46:44.211
This is Miss, uh-

46:44.286 --> 46:47.898
- That's odd. What is your name?
- Jerry. Jerry Stokes.

46:47.966 --> 46:49.908
Lord and Lady Risborough,
Miss Jerry Stokes.

46:49.982 --> 46:51.957
- Uh, how do you do?
- Hello.

46:52.030 --> 46:54.965
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

46:56.703 --> 47:00.216
- How do you do?
- I must talk to you. It's very important.

47:00.287 --> 47:02.742
Yes, of course. First,
have you got a fiver in your pocket?

47:02.815 --> 47:05.084
But, my dear boy,
this is most urgent.

47:05.151 --> 47:07.639
But no more so than this.
Come on. A fiver, please.

47:07.711 --> 47:09.751
- Oh, very well, then.
- Thanks very much.

47:09.823 --> 47:11.798
- Now-
- Just a half a minute.

47:11.871 --> 47:13.781
There you are, my dear.

47:13.855 --> 47:17.784
- That's for you and a thousand thanks.
- You don't owe me all that.

47:17.856 --> 47:22.362
<i>Of course I do, and a great deal more
than I can repay with money. Here.</i>

47:24.928 --> 47:26.935
I- I ain't gonna take it.

47:27.008 --> 47:29.943
Don't you get stubborn with me,
young lady. You want to be choked again?

47:30.016 --> 47:32.056
<i>- Alan!
- Here.</i>

47:32.128 --> 47:35.390
<i>- Alan.
- I tell you there's not a moment to waste.</i>

47:35.456 --> 47:37.398
Certainly, sir. I shan't be a moment.

47:37.472 --> 47:40.123
Alice, I'm sure you and Miss Stokes
will find much to talk about.

47:40.192 --> 47:42.942
- Do you mind if I keep this? I might need it later on.
- Sure.

47:43.009 --> 47:46.238
Five quid! Lummy.

47:46.305 --> 47:49.949
Wish I could meet a bloke like 'im
every day. And me thinkin' he was balmy!

47:50.017 --> 47:52.505
Imagine!

47:53.537 --> 47:56.886
Uh, won't you sit here?

47:59.425 --> 48:02.687
Ooh. This is comfy, ain't it?

48:02.753 --> 48:07.424
<i>Great heavens, Alan. How could
you have got yourself In this awful mess?</i>

48:07.490 --> 48:09.465
How did you know about it?

48:09.538 --> 48:13.793
Their embassy's been making polite
inquiries about you for nearly four weeks.

48:13.858 --> 48:17.087
Lately, they've become
more persistent, more pointed.

48:17.154 --> 48:20.188
Then not 10 minutes ago,
the foreign office telephoned...

48:20.258 --> 48:24.284
that our agents in Berlin
say that you're secretly accused of-

48:24.354 --> 48:27.703
- of an attempt upon the life of their führer.
- Ah!

48:27.778 --> 48:31.039
I told them, of course,
that the suggestion was fantastic...

48:31.106 --> 48:33.726
that there was absolutely no basis
in fact for such an accusation...

48:33.795 --> 48:37.177
that you couldn't possibly
be involved in any such affair.

48:38.339 --> 48:40.281
That is the truth, isn't it?

48:41.314 --> 48:43.202
Yes, Gerald.

48:43.267 --> 48:47.064
Thank heaven. Then you'll go straight with me
to the embassy and clear the matter up at once.

48:47.139 --> 48:49.790
- I'm afraid I can't.
- In heaven's name, why not?

48:49.859 --> 48:54.015
Uh, sit down, Gerald.

48:59.332 --> 49:02.179
Young woman, what is
your connection with Alan?

49:05.188 --> 49:07.195
Alan.

49:07.268 --> 49:09.178
Is that his name?

49:09.252 --> 49:11.838
You-You don't know him?

49:11.908 --> 49:14.079
Never laid me eyes on him
before tonight.

49:14.148 --> 49:17.825
He's a bit of all Right though
if you ask me. A real swell.

49:17.892 --> 49:20.380
I say, what's this jam
he's got mixed up in?

49:20.452 --> 49:23.836
- Are the rozzers after him?
- The-The-The what?

49:23.909 --> 49:26.877
Rozzers!

49:26.949 --> 49:30.210
Dicks! Coppers. Policemen.

49:30.276 --> 49:33.091
Oh, yes, policemen.

49:33.156 --> 49:35.709
Hmm?

49:35.781 --> 49:37.789
Hmm.

49:39.013 --> 49:41.468
- Good, ain't it?
- Mmm.

49:43.301 --> 49:46.400
But, Gerald, old boy, I did not sign
their faked-up confession.

49:46.469 --> 49:49.121
But they won't need it
if they can get you back into Germany.

49:49.190 --> 49:51.743
- They've got to catch me First.
- Oh, but they-

49:51.814 --> 49:54.628
- they know you're in London.
- In that case, I shall get out of England.

49:54.694 --> 49:57.989
But that's impossible too.
You have no passport.

49:58.054 --> 50:01.916
Any effort to obtain a new one
would only involve the government.

50:01.990 --> 50:05.765
Besides, every Ship and plane
leaving the country will be watched.

50:05.830 --> 50:07.805
What about Scotland Yard?

50:07.878 --> 50:09.983
Within 24 hours, there'd
be a démarche on my desk...

50:10.054 --> 50:12.444
asking for your arrest
and return to Berlin.

50:12.518 --> 50:15.552
To refuse their ambassador,
that would be an unfriendly act.

50:15.623 --> 50:18.492
We would have no choice
but to comply.

50:20.999 --> 50:23.749
You know what would happen then?

50:23.815 --> 50:26.750
You mean I might even have the honor
of having my head lobbed off...

50:26.822 --> 50:28.994
by the First headsman of the Reich?

50:29.063 --> 50:33.024
I mean there would First
be a faked-up trial.

50:33.095 --> 50:35.037
Not you...

50:35.110 --> 50:38.592
but England would be convicted
before the world.

50:38.664 --> 50:41.511
And that would pave the way
for what they want-

50:41.575 --> 50:43.517
war.

50:43.592 --> 50:46.440
Don't forget their Reichstag Fire Trial.

50:46.504 --> 50:51.326
You know their genius
for producing witnesses and documents...

50:51.400 --> 50:54.247
to prove their enemies guilty
of what they intend to do.

50:54.311 --> 50:59.200
In that case, I shall imitate their gestapo
and become invisible myself.

50:59.272 --> 51:03.015
I shall vanish utterly, completely,
as if I were dead for as long as you wish.

51:03.081 --> 51:04.990
I'll see no one- not even you.

51:05.065 --> 51:07.683
If I could only help you.

51:07.752 --> 51:09.662
But you can, old boy,
by not worrying.

51:09.737 --> 51:12.290
This whole thing will blow over
before long. It's bound to.

51:12.361 --> 51:14.401
In the meantime,
I give you my word of honor:

51:14.472 --> 51:18.018
<i>There'll be no confession, no trial.</i>

51:19.657 --> 51:22.112
Gerald, I've got one of
my dreadful headaches coming on.

51:22.185 --> 51:25.414
- I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me.
- Why, yes, of course, my dear.

51:25.480 --> 51:27.586
I've left that young person
in the living room. Don't-

51:27.657 --> 51:30.527
Alice, I never thought you'd be
the First to throw up the sponge.

51:30.602 --> 51:33.089
- Come on. You've got to see Jerry at the door.
- No, I shan't.

51:33.161 --> 51:36.478
- But after all, she's your guest, you know?
- I can't. I really can't.

51:36.553 --> 51:38.593
Remember, she thinks you're a lady.

51:38.666 --> 51:42.561
Surely you don't want to disillusion
anyone so young and trusting.

51:42.634 --> 51:44.543
Ah.

51:48.842 --> 51:52.005
Here. You looks like the gentleman
who asked me to have dinner with him...

51:52.074 --> 51:54.595
at Lyons Corner House last bank holiday.

51:54.667 --> 51:57.350
I? Well, I'm not the gentleman, miss.

51:57.418 --> 51:59.655
In fact, I'm not a gentleman at all.

51:59.723 --> 52:03.847
You're the spittin' image of him then,
but you do act more scaredy like.

52:03.915 --> 52:06.500
<i>Now, miss-</i>

52:09.067 --> 52:13.409
Jerry, Lord and Lady Risborough
wish to say good night.

52:13.482 --> 52:17.924
This the First time anything like this
ever happened to me. I'll never forget it.

52:17.996 --> 52:21.792
Good night, Mr. Reeves.
And it was Lyons Corner House.

52:21.868 --> 52:25.349
<i>Good night.</i>

52:25.419 --> 52:27.362
Good night.

52:27.435 --> 52:29.159
- Uh, good night.
- Good night.

52:29.228 --> 52:31.716
- Good night, Alice. Hope to see you very soon.
- Good night, Alan.

52:31.788 --> 52:34.406
Come along, Jerry. Gerald,
I don't know just how I'll work it...

52:34.476 --> 52:37.792
but somehow I'll get word to you
and let you know what's up.

52:37.868 --> 52:39.810
Well, I'll wait till I hear from you.

52:39.884 --> 52:42.568
Beg pardon, my lord. Major Smith
is calling on the telephone again.

52:42.637 --> 52:45.190
- I'm not at home. Well, good night.
- Good night, old chum.

52:45.261 --> 52:48.228
Wait. It's you he wants.

52:48.300 --> 52:50.275
- Who?
- Major Quive-Smith.

52:50.349 --> 52:53.731
- Quive-Smith?
- Yes. He called my office yesterday.

52:53.804 --> 52:58.059
He said he was a neighbor of yours-
a retired military man from the west of England.

52:58.125 --> 53:00.939
- What's he look like?
- Tall, good figure.

53:01.005 --> 53:04.234
Rather formal. Talks about Kenya.
You know the type.

53:04.301 --> 53:06.440
Talks about Kenya?
Does he wear a monocle?

53:06.509 --> 53:08.452
That's the fellow, yes.

53:08.526 --> 53:10.598
- Did he ask if I were here?
- Yes, sir, he did.

53:10.670 --> 53:14.947
<i>- You told him? - Yes, sir. You see,
knowing he was an old friend, I thought-</i>

53:15.022 --> 53:17.477
- Gerald, take that call, will you?
- Well, what should I tell him?

53:17.550 --> 53:21.194
Tell him, uh-
Tell him I've just left for the club.

53:21.262 --> 53:23.880
Good-bye, old chap.

53:23.950 --> 53:26.535
Don't you worry.

53:26.605 --> 53:28.907
Come on.

53:34.479 --> 53:37.479
- Gerald, what is all this cursed mystery?
- Alice.

53:37.551 --> 53:41.512
Ambassadors telephoning? Scotland Yard
phoning? Major Qui Vive on the qui vive.

53:41.583 --> 53:44.485
Alan looking like a police character
with his face clawed like a tiger or something.

53:44.559 --> 53:46.468
He's mad. Perfectly mad! Insane.

53:46.543 --> 53:48.485
- If you want my advice, you'll call the rozzers.
- Rozzer-

53:48.559 --> 53:50.561
- Dicks!
- Di-

54:02.050 --> 54:04.254
All clear, matey!

54:11.010 --> 54:13.596
<i>- Oh, crumbs!
- Huh?</i>

54:13.666 --> 54:16.153
My pin.
Me good luck pin.

54:16.226 --> 54:18.593
It must have fell off
when I dropped me tam.

54:18.658 --> 54:21.975
It was an heart.
Little stones on it all sparkly.

54:22.049 --> 54:24.025
- A gentleman give it me.
- Oh!

54:24.099 --> 54:26.816
- Oh, drat!
- Hey, hey.

54:26.883 --> 54:29.949
In that case, a gentleman
will give you another one.

54:30.019 --> 54:32.703
That's the least I can do for you, isn't it?

54:32.771 --> 54:35.618
You're not half as grown up
as you pretend to be, are you, Jerry?

54:35.683 --> 54:38.138
Now you're making fun of me again.

55:49.766 --> 55:52.734
- Only a flatfoot. I know 'im.
- Oh.

55:54.854 --> 55:57.756
From now on I'll distrust
everybody but you, Jerry.

55:57.830 --> 56:01.375
Get yourself some sleep. I'm going to
curl up on the couch. Good night.

56:02.663 --> 56:04.637
Good night.

56:37.535 --> 56:40.569
Jerry.

56:40.640 --> 56:44.502
What the devil are you
sniffling about? Huh?

56:44.576 --> 56:47.063
<i>What Is It?</i>

56:47.135 --> 56:50.583
My dear child, come on now.

56:50.655 --> 56:52.990
Come on.
No more of this.

56:53.056 --> 56:55.675
Let's stop the crying, what?
That's a girl.

56:55.745 --> 56:58.079
Now, a great big smile.
Come on.

56:58.144 --> 57:00.959
Great big smile.
That's better.

57:01.024 --> 57:03.031
Much better.

57:05.472 --> 57:07.447
Good night.

57:12.256 --> 57:14.777
Good night.

57:43.682 --> 57:46.399
- Oh, good morning, ducky.
- Morning.

57:47.874 --> 57:50.492
I was just on the point
of breaking that door down.

57:50.562 --> 57:52.984
Well, I couldn't leave it
unlocked, could I?

57:53.058 --> 57:55.294
That's Right.
I never thought of that.

57:55.362 --> 57:59.672
And by the way, my girl, who put
that coverlet over me while I slept?

57:59.746 --> 58:02.975
- Don't know. Just got there, I suppose.
- Mmm. I smell food.

58:03.042 --> 58:06.588
- Fish and chips.
- What a miraculous aroma.

58:06.658 --> 58:09.048
If that's as good as it smells-

58:13.155 --> 58:16.058
Come. Sit down.

58:24.675 --> 58:26.650
Ahh.

58:31.555 --> 58:33.857
Go on. Company First.

58:33.925 --> 58:35.899
Um, uh-

58:38.564 --> 58:41.248
- Well, what-
- How does one, uh-

58:41.316 --> 58:43.999
With your fingers, silly, like this.

58:44.068 --> 58:46.654
Mmm. Of course.

58:46.724 --> 58:49.309
I forgot. The fingers
came before forks.

58:49.380 --> 58:51.802
Ain't you never had
fish and chips afore?

58:51.876 --> 58:54.876
- This can't be fish and chips.
- Course it is.

58:54.948 --> 58:57.567
Just think what I've
been missing all my life, huh?

58:57.637 --> 59:00.419
Come on. Dig in, my girl,
before I get your share.

59:07.429 --> 59:10.745
Mmm. That's good.

59:21.061 --> 59:23.779
What's the matter, Jerry?

59:23.846 --> 59:26.716
<i>- You know somethin'?
- What?</i>

59:26.790 --> 59:29.954
- I don't like gentlemen.
- Like me, you mean?

59:30.022 --> 59:32.356
Oh, no.

59:32.422 --> 59:35.139
You act like a gent, but you ain't.

59:35.206 --> 59:39.036
I mean, you really acts like a gent.

59:40.518 --> 59:43.235
Well, that's a very
complicated statement, Jerry.

59:44.646 --> 59:46.915
Shall I tell you something?

59:46.982 --> 59:52.002
You have great character. You're an
extraordinary girl and a very pretty one too.

59:52.071 --> 59:55.038
Come on. Eat up there.

59:59.687 --> 01:00:01.661
Where you goin'?

01:00:05.159 --> 01:00:07.363
Far away.

01:00:07.431 --> 01:00:11.228
Soon I'll have money, and I'll be able to
give the gentleman with the monocle the slip...

01:00:11.303 --> 01:00:13.791
till I get on board a liner.

01:00:13.864 --> 01:00:16.766
- Gentleman with a monocle?
- Uh, the headman, Jerry.

01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:19.229
You saw some of his minions
last night.

01:00:19.304 --> 01:00:23.527
- Oh. Hmm.
- They're just small fry.

01:00:23.592 --> 01:00:26.309
I think that you'd better
come along with me.

01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:32.099
- On a Ship?
- Oh, good heavens, no.

01:00:32.168 --> 01:00:34.175
To my solicitors, I mean.

01:00:34.248 --> 01:00:38.504
I can't come back here, and I want you
to have some money for all you've done.

01:00:47.881 --> 01:00:51.972
I can't leave England, my dear, without knowing
that you have something for your old age-

01:00:52.041 --> 01:00:54.048
a woman of your advanced years.

01:00:54.121 --> 01:00:58.856
My greatest anxiety last night was
in getting you mixed up in my affairs.

01:00:58.921 --> 01:01:00.928
And-

01:01:01.001 --> 01:01:05.126
Say, on second thought,
maybe you'd better not come along.

01:01:05.194 --> 01:01:07.649
I could have Saul
deliver the funds to you here.

01:01:07.722 --> 01:01:10.504
- Oh, no.
- Yeah, I think it'd be safer.

01:01:10.570 --> 01:01:14.181
I don't believe they'd hang around
Saul's office. It's too near the law courts.

01:01:14.250 --> 01:01:17.218
- But they might.
- What about you?

01:01:17.290 --> 01:01:19.297
Huh? Oh, I can shake 'em all Right.

01:01:19.370 --> 01:01:23.167
It's amazing how reassuring the sunlight is,
but I was pretty jumpy last night.

01:01:23.242 --> 01:01:26.952
- I'm going along.
- But there's no point in it, no use at all.

01:01:31.243 --> 01:01:33.544
How do I know
I'm gonna get what-

01:01:35.243 --> 01:01:37.610
what you promised me?

01:01:40.875 --> 01:01:44.356
So you don't trust me, huh?

01:01:46.251 --> 01:01:48.258
I always pay my debts.

01:01:48.331 --> 01:01:51.779
<i>I propose to get you £500.
You may have more, If you want It.</i>

01:01:56.556 --> 01:01:58.661
I don't mean money.

01:02:01.676 --> 01:02:04.010
Well, what in heaven's name
do you mean?

01:02:04.075 --> 01:02:07.850
You promised me...

01:02:07.915 --> 01:02:11.527
a pin for me hat.

01:02:14.764 --> 01:02:18.758
My dear Jerry, forgive me.

01:02:18.828 --> 01:02:21.130
I might have known.

01:02:21.197 --> 01:02:24.809
Every good soldier needs
a crest for his cap.

01:02:24.877 --> 01:02:27.877
And you shall have your pin
set with diamonds, if you wish.

01:02:27.949 --> 01:02:30.251
Huh?

01:02:30.317 --> 01:02:32.324
Mmm.

01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:52.554
<i>- Good morning.
- Good morning, mein Herr. Good morning, fräulein.</i>

01:02:53.966 --> 01:02:56.486
What shall it be?

01:02:56.558 --> 01:03:00.835
Uh- Uh, you've got a, um-

01:03:00.910 --> 01:03:03.365
a pin, sort of a brooch,
in the Window.

01:03:03.438 --> 01:03:06.667
<i>Ja. Ja. I show it to you.</i>

01:03:06.733 --> 01:03:08.742
It's a large heart.

01:03:08.815 --> 01:03:12.295
You know what? I don't want an heart.
It's too much like-

01:03:12.367 --> 01:03:14.985
Like the one you lost.
That's what you want, isn't it?

01:03:15.055 --> 01:03:19.332
So beautiful that piece of jewelry
and so fine a sentiment- the heart.

01:03:19.407 --> 01:03:22.985
<i>You see, fräulein? It's gold plate,
and the fine stones just like diamonds.</i>

01:03:23.054 --> 01:03:25.258
You know, I think
it's rather appropriate.

01:03:25.326 --> 01:03:28.294
<i>- How much is this one?
- Ten shillings, fräulein.</i>

01:03:28.367 --> 01:03:31.978
Very cheap. It costs you
two guineas on Regent Street.

01:03:32.046 --> 01:03:35.495
You should have that and
put it in the gentleman's heart, no?

01:03:35.568 --> 01:03:37.575
Is it real silver?

01:03:37.648 --> 01:03:40.015
Better. It's chromium.

01:03:41.968 --> 01:03:45.001
<i>- Can I have it?
- Well, Certainly, if you want to be heartless.</i>

01:03:45.072 --> 01:03:47.625
<i>Good, good.
You make no mistake, fräulein.</i>

01:03:47.696 --> 01:03:52.006
A lifetime, I tell you.
You will have it still when you die.

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:55.396
- Go on. Take it.
- No. You've got to give it me.

01:03:55.472 --> 01:03:57.480
I- Oh.

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:02.255
I present you with
this dangerous weapon, mademoiselle...

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:05.103
with my undying gratitude
and admiration.

01:04:05.169 --> 01:04:07.984
May you never lodge it
in the wrong heart.

01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:16.364
- There you are, sir.
- One pound, 20 shillings. I give you change.

01:04:16.433 --> 01:04:20.459
No, keep it, keep it. There mustn't be
anything mercenary about this soldier's crest.

01:04:20.529 --> 01:04:24.392
<i>- It's got to bring luck.
- Danke. Danke. Danke, mein Herr.</i>

01:04:26.482 --> 01:04:30.672
I think that looks very nice.
Don't you? Huh? Shall we go?

01:04:30.738 --> 01:04:33.323
<i>- Come on.
- Auf Wiedersehen. Auf Wiedersehen.</i>

01:04:33.393 --> 01:04:34.604
<i>- Good-bye.
- Auf Wiedersehen.</i>

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:31.951
<i>Ja?</i>

01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:38.578
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

01:05:38.645 --> 01:05:40.652
Six.

01:05:41.717 --> 01:05:43.724
Farnsworthy's office.

01:05:52.085 --> 01:05:55.696
Well, uh, it isn't
exactly, uh, Savile Row.

01:05:55.765 --> 01:05:59.659
It was the best I could do. After all,
you phoned less than an hour ago.

01:05:59.733 --> 01:06:01.708
Well.

01:06:05.078 --> 01:06:08.623
Well, uh, aren't you going to
ask any questions?

01:06:08.693 --> 01:06:11.377
Only one.

01:06:11.446 --> 01:06:14.064
Have you been abroad
in the employ of our government?

01:06:14.134 --> 01:06:17.931
- No, on my own business.
- I beg you to let me talk to the police.

01:06:18.006 --> 01:06:20.013
You don't realize
the power of your name.

01:06:20.086 --> 01:06:23.250
That is precisely what makes
my disappearance necessary and urgent.

01:06:23.318 --> 01:06:25.325
But, my dear chap, don't you realize-

01:06:25.398 --> 01:06:28.661
If I get as far as Algiers,
I'll give those fellas a run for their money.

01:06:28.727 --> 01:06:31.727
Africa is one continent I know
better than all their invisible men.

01:06:31.799 --> 01:06:34.613
- This the, uh, ooftish?
- That is the money, yes.

01:06:34.679 --> 01:06:36.686
If you don't mind,
we'll check the amount.

01:06:36.759 --> 01:06:38.766
<i>No, no.
I'll just take £500.</i>

01:06:38.839 --> 01:06:41.621
And, uh, Saul, you can instruct her
how to deposit it.

01:06:41.686 --> 01:06:44.370
<i>- Very good.
- I don't want it.</i>

01:06:44.439 --> 01:06:46.828
- I won't take it!
- Oh, yes, you will.

01:06:46.903 --> 01:06:49.390
I'm going to have my way
at least once with you.

01:06:49.462 --> 01:06:51.851
I wouldn't know
what to do with all that money.

01:06:51.927 --> 01:06:53.935
<i>- Mr. Farnsworthy will tell you.
- Yes.</i>

01:06:54.007 --> 01:06:56.014
I won't take it.
You'll want it.

01:06:56.087 --> 01:06:58.673
- Will you be Quiet?
- No.

01:06:58.744 --> 01:07:01.329
I can't stand a blubbering female.

01:07:01.399 --> 01:07:03.472
I've never seen
such a stubborn woman.

01:07:03.544 --> 01:07:06.839
And if you say one word of thanks,
I'll tear out your hair.

01:07:06.903 --> 01:07:09.718
Jerry, this isn't
paying you for anything.

01:07:09.783 --> 01:07:12.118
I can never do that.

01:07:12.184 --> 01:07:16.177
Come on now. Frown. Frown.

01:07:16.247 --> 01:07:19.631
You stubborn little monkey.
She won't do anything I ask her to.

01:07:19.705 --> 01:07:21.712
- Yes, yes.
- Jerry-

01:07:21.785 --> 01:07:24.370
The German embassy
telephoned here a few days ago.

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:27.375
Their inquiry was pointedly casual.

01:07:27.449 --> 01:07:29.456
Anyone else ask for me?

01:07:29.528 --> 01:07:32.943
A friend of yours came in
to see me the other day...

01:07:33.016 --> 01:07:35.405
to consult me about
some inconceivable tangle...

01:07:35.481 --> 01:07:37.783
<i>under the Married Woman's
Property Act.</i>

01:07:37.849 --> 01:07:41.110
He was continually referring to you.

01:07:41.177 --> 01:07:44.047
Was he, uh, English?

01:07:44.122 --> 01:07:46.511
Too perfectly.

01:07:46.586 --> 01:07:49.815
Major Quive-Smith, he called himself.

01:07:53.466 --> 01:07:56.761
Anybody taking an interest in us, Peale?

01:07:56.825 --> 01:07:59.029
I've just been taking
a look outside, sir.

01:07:59.097 --> 01:08:01.781
The gentleman in the black hat
is still feeding the pigeons, sir.

01:08:01.850 --> 01:08:05.778
And now he's been joined by the military-looking
gentleman who visited you last week.

01:08:05.850 --> 01:08:09.167
Captain Thorndike's friend,
the gentleman with the monocle.

01:08:09.242 --> 01:08:11.959
- You see?
- Hmm.

01:08:12.026 --> 01:08:14.328
<i>- Thank you, Peale.
- Not at all, sir.</i>

01:08:16.763 --> 01:08:19.578
- Is there another way out of here?
- There's the back staircase.

01:08:19.643 --> 01:08:21.649
Oh, good.

01:08:23.258 --> 01:08:25.331
Thank you, Saul, very much.

01:08:25.403 --> 01:08:27.639
Good luck, you fool.

01:08:27.706 --> 01:08:31.318
Oh, uh, one thing more.

01:08:31.386 --> 01:08:34.386
If, at any time,
I am found...

01:08:34.459 --> 01:08:37.077
the coroner brings in
a verdict of suicide-

01:08:37.147 --> 01:08:41.140
- Suicide?
- Don't you believe it, huh?

01:08:41.212 --> 01:08:43.416
- But don't attempt to reopen the case.
- All Right.

01:08:43.484 --> 01:08:46.386
Bye, Jerry. You wait here for an hour
and go out the front way.

01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:49.459
- I'm going with you.
- Now see here. I've had enough of this.

01:08:49.531 --> 01:08:52.433
Don't you see that your own safety
lies in keeping away from me?

01:08:52.506 --> 01:08:55.354
- Where you goin'?
- To the Underground, on my way to nowhere.

01:08:55.420 --> 01:08:58.138
I'm goin' to the Underground too.
I gotta get home, haven't I?

01:08:58.203 --> 01:09:01.716
- Saul, will you drag this human leech off me?
- I will not.

01:09:01.788 --> 01:09:05.171
- I'm goin' to the Underground.
- All Right!

01:09:05.243 --> 01:09:08.343
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

01:09:08.412 --> 01:09:11.859
<i>It's all Right here. Read about It.</i>

01:09:11.933 --> 01:09:14.354
<i>First news out Right here!</i>

01:09:16.988 --> 01:09:20.982
<i>Right here!
First news out Right here. Read about It.</i>

01:09:21.051 --> 01:09:23.060
This is it, Jerry.

01:09:23.133 --> 01:09:26.613
And there's your ticket.
Good-bye, and take good care of yourself.

01:09:28.350 --> 01:09:31.197
You know, you're like
that little arrow on your hat-

01:09:31.261 --> 01:09:34.359
straight and shining- and that's
the way I'll always remember you.

01:09:36.990 --> 01:09:41.081
Good luck, little one.
Good-bye again.

01:09:41.149 --> 01:09:43.255
<i>Right here! First news out Right here!</i>

01:09:43.325 --> 01:09:45.714
Read about it!
Right here!

01:09:45.790 --> 01:09:47.765
First news out Right here!

01:09:50.910 --> 01:09:53.462
<i>Right here!</i>

01:09:53.533 --> 01:09:56.949
Come get your newspaper!

01:09:57.022 --> 01:09:59.608
<i>First results Right here!</i>

01:14:59.528 --> 01:15:02.724
Tube murder mystery! Paper!
Shocking murder mystery.

01:15:02.791 --> 01:15:04.963
Paper, sir?
Thank you, sir.

01:15:05.032 --> 01:15:09.188
‘‘Captain Thorndike's body was mangled
beyond recognition by the train.

01:15:09.256 --> 01:15:13.119
‘‘A positive identification was made
possible by his passport and wallet...

01:15:13.193 --> 01:15:15.200
‘‘which he carried.

01:15:15.272 --> 01:15:17.989
‘‘Shortly after the crime,
a ticket collector tried to stop a man...

01:15:18.056 --> 01:15:22.497
‘‘with a scar on his Right cheek who escaped
after presenting the wrong ticket.

01:15:22.569 --> 01:15:27.587
‘‘Evidently, the murderer had made
his way back through the tunnel on foot.

01:15:27.656 --> 01:15:30.591
Police are searching
for such a man. "

01:15:30.665 --> 01:15:33.665
- But who was killed?
- I don't know.

01:15:33.737 --> 01:15:36.355
Only a few people know,
and they won't tell.

01:15:36.425 --> 01:15:38.914
Hmm.

01:15:38.986 --> 01:15:42.499
Now they can hunt me down at leisure,
with the help of the British police.

01:15:44.778 --> 01:15:48.804
Perhaps I was a fool to come back here.
I could have been well out of London by now.

01:15:48.873 --> 01:15:51.262
But I wanted to hide out
till it was dark.

01:15:51.338 --> 01:15:54.273
Yeah. You're gonna stay here?

01:15:54.346 --> 01:15:56.712
Huh? No.

01:15:56.778 --> 01:16:00.007
<i>- I've got to get out tonight.
- Ain't I never gonna see you again?</i>

01:16:00.074 --> 01:16:03.784
<i>Of course. Someday
when this all blows over.</i>

01:16:05.354 --> 01:16:08.354
You know where my brother lives.

01:16:08.427 --> 01:16:11.242
Tell him I'm not dead.

01:16:11.307 --> 01:16:13.347
He'll take care of you.

01:16:13.419 --> 01:16:16.266
Ask him to write to me
in, oh, a fortnight.

01:16:16.331 --> 01:16:18.632
No. Three weeks.
Tell me all he can.

01:16:18.698 --> 01:16:22.561
By that time, I'll have a beard, and I can
walk into a village without being suspected.

01:16:22.634 --> 01:16:25.187
He needn't sign the letter
because I'll know whom it's from.

01:16:25.258 --> 01:16:28.041
- But if he puts your name on it-
- He won't.

01:16:28.108 --> 01:16:32.810
He'll address it to, uh-
to... your name.

01:16:32.876 --> 01:16:34.883
Mr. Stokes.

01:16:34.955 --> 01:16:37.344
Mr. Stokes, care of the post office
at Lyme Regis.

01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:40.486
- Lyme Regis.
- Uh, have you got a pencil? I'll write it down for you.

01:16:41.868 --> 01:16:45.665
Over there in the basket. Lyme Regis.

01:16:45.740 --> 01:16:48.587
Lyme Regis. That's it. Here now.

01:16:50.027 --> 01:16:54.022
Mr. D.F.- ‘‘F" is for ‘‘fool. "

01:16:54.093 --> 01:16:56.232
Stokes.

01:16:56.301 --> 01:16:58.308
Post office...

01:16:58.381 --> 01:17:03.050
Lyme Regis, Dorset.

01:17:03.116 --> 01:17:05.320
There you are. Now you can't forget.

01:17:05.388 --> 01:17:08.422
And remember: in three weeks.

01:17:08.493 --> 01:17:11.308
You got that?

01:17:11.373 --> 01:17:13.926
Well, come on now. Cheer up.

01:17:22.382 --> 01:17:25.829
You are the most stubborn little monkey
I have ever seen.

01:17:28.654 --> 01:17:32.363
But... this is as far as you go.

01:17:32.430 --> 01:17:34.502
Not a step further.

01:17:34.574 --> 01:17:37.443
Good-bye, Jerry, and thank you.

01:17:39.854 --> 01:17:41.861
Please go.

01:17:43.534 --> 01:17:47.244
- Kiss me.
- Jerry.

01:17:47.311 --> 01:17:49.384
Won't you kiss me?

01:17:49.455 --> 01:17:52.269
I know I'm never
gonna see you again!

01:17:52.335 --> 01:17:56.077
Why, dear, dear child.

01:18:02.543 --> 01:18:04.550
Alan.

01:18:17.999 --> 01:18:21.348
Come along, deary. There's a cozy
little pub just across the bridge.

01:18:21.423 --> 01:18:25.133
Ain't half bad either, ducky.
Come on.

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:27.917
- What you want?
- Now, go on, miss. Go on.

01:18:27.984 --> 01:18:32.239
<i>I don't want to see you girls get Into trouble,
but you can't be pestering gentlemen.</i>

01:18:32.304 --> 01:18:35.304
- Who's pesterin' who?
- Now get along! Get along!

01:18:35.376 --> 01:18:38.410
I'm sorry, sir.
If I was you, I'd step along.

01:18:38.481 --> 01:18:40.685
Don't get mixed up
with these here girls.

01:18:40.753 --> 01:18:42.957
- Here, who you callin' names?
- Now that's enough!

01:18:43.025 --> 01:18:45.643
You leave the gentleman alone!
Get along. Get along.

01:18:45.713 --> 01:18:47.687
Good night, sir.

01:19:01.457 --> 01:19:03.661
Get going.
Get going.

01:19:49.203 --> 01:19:51.178
Fritz.

01:20:00.948 --> 01:20:03.152
Take me out of here, quick!

01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:05.391
- These here men!
- Come.

01:20:26.804 --> 01:20:29.521
Sit down, my dear.

01:20:29.589 --> 01:20:31.792
We're gonna have a little chat.

01:20:44.021 --> 01:20:46.836
Good afternoon, madam.
I think you may have a letter for me.

01:20:46.901 --> 01:20:49.203
- What name, please?
- Stokes.

01:20:53.077 --> 01:20:55.052
<i>- D.F. Stokes?
- Yes.</i>

01:20:57.398 --> 01:20:59.405
Come.
Go through them, please.

01:20:59.477 --> 01:21:02.259
Yes, sir. It's- It's in here.

01:21:05.142 --> 01:21:07.892
There's a parcel for you, too,
in the back room...

01:21:07.959 --> 01:21:10.348
if you'll wait a minute, please.

01:21:10.423 --> 01:21:12.430
Just a minute.

01:21:14.263 --> 01:21:17.045
<i>Mary.</i>

01:23:31.356 --> 01:23:33.364
<i>Thorndike.</i>

01:23:42.556 --> 01:23:44.564
<i>Thorndike!</i>

01:23:47.196 --> 01:23:50.327
You might as well be reasonable,
my dear fellow.

01:23:50.396 --> 01:23:54.739
I'm so glad you had the sense not to
break out while I was sealing you up.

01:23:54.812 --> 01:23:58.457
- Now you cannot get out.
- You can't get in, you mean.

01:23:58.525 --> 01:24:02.519
I have no desire to enter a cave
after a trapped animal...

01:24:02.589 --> 01:24:05.207
even though I know
you have no weapons.

01:24:05.277 --> 01:24:08.124
I admired your stone door
so much that I imitated it...

01:24:08.190 --> 01:24:10.939
by wedging another stone
on the outside.

01:24:11.005 --> 01:24:13.394
You're sealed up, as in a grave.

01:24:40.286 --> 01:24:43.864
It's no use, Thorndike.
No use at all.

01:24:48.575 --> 01:24:50.964
Couldn't you have given me
a cleaner death than this?

01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:53.658
<i>Don't be a fool.
I could have killed you an hour ago.</i>

01:24:53.727 --> 01:24:56.116
<i>My purpose was to trap you alive.</i>

01:24:56.192 --> 01:24:58.974
<i>You've been Immensely helpful.</i>

01:25:06.879 --> 01:25:10.108
<i>- What is it you want?
- Now you're being sensible.</i>

01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:14.905
<i>- Have you got It?
- What Is It?</i>

01:25:14.976 --> 01:25:17.562
<i>It Is the confession that,
with the approval of your government...</i>

01:25:17.632 --> 01:25:19.639
<i>you sought to assassinate
our führer.</i>

01:25:19.712 --> 01:25:21.719
Go to the devil!

01:25:21.792 --> 01:25:25.404
You're growing wearisome, Thorndike.

01:25:26.976 --> 01:25:28.983
Once more, I ask you to sign...

01:25:29.056 --> 01:25:31.260
<i>and save us both
an unpleasant conclusion.</i>

01:25:31.328 --> 01:25:33.881
I told you once, I don't sign lies!

01:25:33.952 --> 01:25:37.782
<i>You also told me you no longer believed
In killing, yet you killed one of my men.</i>

01:25:37.857 --> 01:25:40.246
Oh, I'm not blaming you in the least.

01:25:40.321 --> 01:25:44.249
I merely wish to point out
that a lie is relative...

01:25:44.321 --> 01:25:46.328
<i>as Is truth.</i>

01:25:46.401 --> 01:25:50.362
I tell you, I did not intend
to shoot your bloody führer!

01:25:52.961 --> 01:25:55.383
I believe you.
I believe you're sincere.

01:25:55.457 --> 01:25:57.727
I really do at last.

01:25:57.793 --> 01:26:00.280
You actually think you had
no intention to kill...

01:26:00.353 --> 01:26:03.769
<i>that It was all a ‘‘sporting stalk, "
as you call It.</i>

01:26:03.842 --> 01:26:07.323
- It was!
- And yet every minute, you were deceiving yourself.

01:26:07.394 --> 01:26:10.689
- And every hour since then, you have lied to yourself.
- No!

01:26:10.754 --> 01:26:13.656
<i>You've refused to face
your secret self, Thorndike.</i>

01:26:13.730 --> 01:26:17.789
<i>From the moment you crossed the frontier,
you became an unconscious assassin.</i>

01:26:20.674 --> 01:26:24.090
I'm going to show you to yourself
as you really are, Thorndike.

01:26:24.162 --> 01:26:27.742
I'm going to break through that
civilized English mask you were born with.

01:26:27.811 --> 01:26:30.975
I'm going to show you
what you really are and were-

01:26:31.043 --> 01:26:33.498
<i>an assassin.</i>

01:26:33.571 --> 01:26:36.920
You fool!
You fanatical fool!

01:26:42.691 --> 01:26:44.666
<i>A token for you, Thorndike.</i>

01:26:47.011 --> 01:26:49.312
<i>To make you see the truth.</i>

01:26:53.124 --> 01:26:55.545
Jerry. Jerry.

01:26:58.212 --> 01:27:00.798
Where is she?
What have you done with her?

01:27:03.012 --> 01:27:05.827
Do you expect me
to lie to you, Thorndike?

01:27:05.892 --> 01:27:09.569
Do you expect me to tell you
that it was a sporting stalk?

01:27:09.636 --> 01:27:11.644
<i>No.</i>

01:27:11.716 --> 01:27:15.011
<i>I am honest with you
as you are not honest with me.</i>

01:27:15.076 --> 01:27:17.083
<i>She made your mistake, Thorndike.</i>

01:27:17.156 --> 01:27:19.262
<i>She flaunted obvious power.</i>

01:27:19.333 --> 01:27:21.308
<i>She refused to tell us anything.</i>

01:27:23.717 --> 01:27:27.295
Do you know that if it hadn't been for that
postal address you so thoughtfully wrote down...

01:27:27.365 --> 01:27:29.634
<i>I don't know what
I should have done.</i>

01:27:29.701 --> 01:27:33.017
If you've harmed that girl,
I swear I'll kill you somehow!

01:27:33.093 --> 01:27:36.027
I'll live to kill you
if it's the last thing I do!

01:27:36.101 --> 01:27:40.923
You believed that the death of our sacred
führer would be no great loss to the world.

01:27:40.997 --> 01:27:45.820
<i>Surely, then, the death of a girl like that
would be no loss at all.</i>

01:27:45.894 --> 01:27:49.309
She was found dead
in the street, Thorndike.

01:27:49.382 --> 01:27:52.284
The police reported that she, uh...

01:27:52.358 --> 01:27:54.948
jumped to her death from a Window.

01:27:55.076 --> 01:27:58.589
She had nothing to do with my actions!
She was innocent! Innocent!

01:27:58.660 --> 01:28:01.955
Yes, just as innocent as our führer
was of any wrongdoing against you.

01:28:02.020 --> 01:28:05.598
No! He's guilty- guilty against me
and against humanity!

01:28:05.668 --> 01:28:08.288
Against every decent,
peaceful person in the world!

01:28:08.358 --> 01:28:10.747
He's guilty of hatred,
intolerance and murder!

01:28:10.821 --> 01:28:14.018
<i>- And that Is why you tried to kill him?
- Yes, I intended to shoot!</i>

01:28:14.085 --> 01:28:16.932
I didn't know what I was doing!
I didn't realize my purpose!

01:28:16.998 --> 01:28:19.715
I wouldn't face the fact
that I can make myself the instrument...

01:28:19.781 --> 01:28:22.399
of all the pitiable, oppressed,
suffering people of the world!

01:28:22.469 --> 01:28:25.152
I wonder why I put that shell in my gun.
Now I know!

01:28:25.221 --> 01:28:29.694
Yes, I intended to kill! I intended to
avenge the crimes of this monstrous tyrant!

01:28:29.765 --> 01:28:32.352
<i>- I know it now!
- And you were acting for your government?</i>

01:28:32.422 --> 01:28:35.455
<i>- No, for myself!.
- But It was for the sake of your country, wasn't It?</i>

01:28:35.526 --> 01:28:39.039
No, for mine, as well as others.
For your misguided people as well as my own!

01:28:39.110 --> 01:28:42.405
<i>Then even though your government knew
nothing about you, you were acting on their behalf.</i>

01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:45.437
<i>- No!
- You said you wouldn't sign lies. I've proved them true.</i>

01:28:45.510 --> 01:28:49.666
<i>You've admitted the whole thing.</i>

01:28:51.142 --> 01:28:53.379
I have a plane
waiting for me in Croydon.

01:28:53.446 --> 01:28:57.637
I must soon go. But when I go, it will be
with that document, signed by yourself.

01:28:57.703 --> 01:29:00.737
It may interest you to know
why that document is needed.

01:29:00.808 --> 01:29:05.794
It will make interesting reading when
we publish the First German white paper.

01:29:05.863 --> 01:29:07.870
What do you mean?

01:29:07.943 --> 01:29:11.685
<i>- My country has already marched Into Poland.
- I don't believe you.</i>

01:29:11.751 --> 01:29:13.955
Twenty divisions
crossed the frontier today.

01:29:14.023 --> 01:29:17.733
<i>If you're telling the truth, England
and France will be at war with you within a week!</i>

01:29:17.799 --> 01:29:19.839
You're commencing to rave.

01:29:19.911 --> 01:29:24.930
We shall take Poland, and no nation
in Europe will dare to raise a hand.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.830
We're on the march at last, Thorndike.

01:29:28.904 --> 01:29:30.911
Today, Europe.

01:29:30.984 --> 01:29:33.122
Tomorrow, the world.

01:29:43.912 --> 01:29:47.010
<i>Thorndike.</i>

01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:49.536
<i>Thorndike, why don't you answer me?</i>

01:29:49.609 --> 01:29:51.617
Uh, what?

01:29:51.690 --> 01:29:54.439
<i>I'm waiting for you to sign.</i>

01:29:54.505 --> 01:29:59.240
Uh- I've- I've got
to read it, haven't I?

01:29:59.305 --> 01:30:01.793
<i>Oh, Certainly.
Take your time.</i>

01:30:19.114 --> 01:30:22.114
<i>- Have you got a cigarette?
- Yes. Certainly.</i>

01:30:27.114 --> 01:30:29.318
<i>It's on the stick.
Pull It In.</i>

01:30:41.323 --> 01:30:43.297
<i>Have you read It?</i>

01:30:44.395 --> 01:30:47.045
I've got to think it over.

01:30:49.195 --> 01:30:51.584
I shall give you
15 minutes, Thorndike.

01:30:56.331 --> 01:31:00.422
<i>When the time Is up, If you haven't
delivered that document to me properly signed...</i>

01:31:00.491 --> 01:31:03.526
<i>I shall shut off your air
and go on my way.</i>

01:31:03.596 --> 01:31:05.963
<i>You may last a few hours...</i>

01:31:06.028 --> 01:31:09.705
<i>but they will be most unpleasant.</i>

01:31:09.772 --> 01:31:12.706
How do I know you'll let me out
after I've signed?

01:31:14.604 --> 01:31:17.060
I shall remove the outside stone...

01:31:17.132 --> 01:31:20.035
when you're ready to hand it out.

01:31:20.108 --> 01:31:22.727
<i>And then shoot me when I crawl out.</i>

01:31:23.916 --> 01:31:26.087
My gun is in its holster.

01:31:26.156 --> 01:31:30.085
<i>You will have to take my word
as a fellow hunter for that.</i>

01:31:31.533 --> 01:31:33.803
<i>Thirteen minutes, Thorndike.</i>

01:32:09.294 --> 01:32:11.301
I've removed the barrier, Thorndike.

01:32:11.374 --> 01:32:13.349
<i>Are you ready?</i>

01:32:15.886 --> 01:32:18.822
<i>- Do you hear me, Thorndike?
- Yes, I hear you.</i>

01:32:18.895 --> 01:32:21.578
<i>Five minutes more.</i>

01:32:21.647 --> 01:32:23.981
Have you removed the outside stone?

01:32:24.047 --> 01:32:27.047
<i>Open your side of the cave,
and you'll see.</i>

01:32:42.512 --> 01:32:45.676
<i>- Are you satisfied?
- Yes, I can see it's clear.</i>

01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:51.179
Your time is nearly up, Thorndike.

01:32:51.248 --> 01:32:53.255
Hand out the document.

01:32:53.328 --> 01:32:57.005
You'll have to reach for it.

01:32:57.072 --> 01:32:59.690
Hand it out through the venthole.

01:33:05.519 --> 01:33:07.724
<i>Your time Is up.
I'm waiting.</i>

01:33:07.792 --> 01:33:10.476
<i>And be sure It's signed.</i>

01:33:26.737 --> 01:33:29.421
<i>There It Is.</i>

01:33:29.489 --> 01:33:31.496
Push it nearer.

01:33:31.569 --> 01:33:34.320
I don't propose
to have my wrist seized.

01:33:39.314 --> 01:33:41.932
You can come out now, Thorndike.

01:33:45.202 --> 01:33:48.999
Come on out, Thorndike.
You're free at last.

01:35:29.077 --> 01:35:32.426
You're like that little arrow on your hat-
straight and shining-

01:35:32.502 --> 01:35:35.088
and that's the way
I'll always remember you.

01:35:39.895 --> 01:35:44.018
<i>Surely then the death of
a girl like that would be no loss at all.</i>

01:35:44.086 --> 01:35:47.632
Ain't-Ain't I never gonna see you again?

01:35:49.207 --> 01:35:51.924
Every good soldier
needs a crest for his hat.

01:36:00.343 --> 01:36:03.344
<i>- Your course and objective
are clearly marked on this map.</i>

01:36:03.416 --> 01:36:05.391
- Yes, sir.
- Here.

01:36:05.464 --> 01:36:07.569
You will make your reconnaissance
and return immediately.

01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:10.290
<i>- Right, sir.
- All the best, old chap.</i>

01:36:10.359 --> 01:36:12.367
Thank you, sir.

01:36:44.601 --> 01:36:47.023
We've just passed over into Germany.

01:36:47.096 --> 01:36:49.780
Right.

01:36:49.849 --> 01:36:52.118
- One of the men just bailed out!
- What? Who?

01:36:52.185 --> 01:36:54.096
- Thorndike.
- Thorndike?

01:36:59.546 --> 01:37:03.091
<i>And from now on, somewhere within Germany...</i>

01:37:03.161 --> 01:37:06.260
<i>Is a man with a precision rifle...</i>

01:37:06.330 --> 01:37:10.770
<i>and the High degree of Intelligence
and training that Is required to use It.</i>

01:37:12.026 --> 01:37:15.157
<i>It may be days, months...</i>

01:37:15.226 --> 01:37:17.233
<i>or even years...</i>

01:37:17.306 --> 01:37:20.438
<i>but this time
he clearly knows his purpose...</i>

01:37:20.507 --> 01:37:23.768
<i>and, unflinching, faces his destiny.</i>
