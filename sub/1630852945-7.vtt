WEBVTT

00:05.290 --> 00:06.691
-(tires screech)
-Fuck!

00:06.824 --> 00:08.626
-(grunts)
-(gunfire)

00:08.759 --> 00:10.661
FRANKLIN:
Three coordinated hits.

00:10.795 --> 00:12.630
I didn't see any of 'em coming.

00:12.763 --> 00:14.832
JEROME:
Shit ain't got nothing to do
with no Peaches.

00:14.965 --> 00:16.867
If he did do this,
ain't no way he stuck around.

00:17.001 --> 00:19.370
-He didn't do it alone, neither.
-LOUIE: It was a big hit.

00:19.504 --> 00:21.339
Lot of people involved.
Somebody gonna talk.

00:21.472 --> 00:22.640
Yeah, a'ight.

00:22.773 --> 00:23.841
You heard what she said, right?

00:23.974 --> 00:25.843
Nigga, I just said, "A'ight."

00:25.976 --> 00:26.711
JEROME:
Fucking...

00:26.844 --> 00:28.646
(grunting, muttering)

00:30.815 --> 00:32.250
(groaning)

00:32.383 --> 00:33.851
PARISSA:
The last two days

00:33.984 --> 00:36.721
have been the most fun
I've had in years.

00:41.826 --> 00:45.596
I have wanted to do that
ever since Tehran.

00:45.730 --> 00:48.199
You said you could keep me safe,

00:48.333 --> 00:50.235
but you can't.

00:51.969 --> 00:53.738
No.

00:53.871 --> 00:54.939
But we'll find them.

00:55.072 --> 00:56.674
Maybe this time.

00:56.807 --> 00:58.209
What about next time, huh?

00:58.343 --> 00:59.544
BLACK DIAMOND:
We're hearing another name.

00:59.677 --> 01:00.845
-DALLAS: Kane.
-KANE: Didn't think y'all

01:00.978 --> 01:02.247
would find me this quick.

01:02.380 --> 01:03.681
I heard about Kev.

01:03.814 --> 01:04.915
You don't know
what really happened.

01:05.049 --> 01:07.252
You didn't shoot and kill
my baby brother?

01:07.385 --> 01:10.721
You know, we can come at you
at any time, any place.

01:10.855 --> 01:13.658
Does it look like I'm fucking
hiding, little nigga?

01:17.328 --> 01:18.763
(door opens)

01:22.600 --> 01:24.702
LOUIE:
What'd he say to that?

01:24.835 --> 01:26.271
He said next time
he'd do it right.

01:26.404 --> 01:27.572
What about Peaches?

01:27.705 --> 01:29.640
What he say about
that turncoat motherfucker?

01:29.774 --> 01:31.576
I don't think he knew.

01:31.709 --> 01:32.910
Peaches just wanted the money.

01:35.045 --> 01:36.981
I got Top Notch
to hire a professional

01:37.114 --> 01:39.417
who will hunt that nigga down.
We'll find him.

01:39.550 --> 01:41.419
Okay, so how we gonna
hit back at Kane?

01:41.552 --> 01:42.720
LEON:
We don't.

01:43.721 --> 01:44.755
Not yet.

01:44.889 --> 01:47.558
Nigga, I'm still drunk.

01:47.692 --> 01:51.329
So, you're gonna tell me
we ain't gonna hit back at Kane?

01:51.462 --> 01:52.830
You know the score.

01:52.963 --> 01:54.632
Kane an OG, got pull everywhere.

01:54.765 --> 01:55.833
We hit him, it's a war.

01:55.966 --> 01:57.468
Nigga, we already at war.

01:57.602 --> 01:59.637
LOUIE:
We can hit him.
We just make sure

01:59.770 --> 02:01.272
-they don't know it's us.
-LEON: We ain't doing
that bullshit.

02:01.406 --> 02:02.507
Letting that piece of shit cop

02:02.640 --> 02:04.242
kill the man
who practically raised us.

02:04.375 --> 02:05.743
Who practically killed us.

02:05.876 --> 02:08.513
-I'm-a handle this shit.
-How you gonna do that?

02:08.646 --> 02:10.681
I'm-a sit down with Kane to
let him know he got two options:

02:10.815 --> 02:13.484
We fix shit with his family,

02:13.618 --> 02:15.320
or I take him
and his whole crew out myself.

02:15.453 --> 02:17.688
-What you mean by "fix shit"?
-LEON: You ain't
gonna like this,

02:17.822 --> 02:19.857
-but Kane got legitimate beef.
-Nigga, we got legitimate beef.

02:19.990 --> 02:21.459
We killed the nigga brother,

02:21.592 --> 02:22.860
and we ain't take care
of his family.

02:22.993 --> 02:25.296
What the fuck you expect?

02:25.430 --> 02:27.432
Well, you awfully quiet
over there for a change.

02:28.633 --> 02:31.269
We spoke about it
on the car ride over.

02:31.402 --> 02:33.271
I know what that nigga did.

02:33.404 --> 02:35.673
My unborn baby,

02:35.806 --> 02:37.642
my mother being shot at.

02:37.775 --> 02:39.810
If it was anybody else,
I'd put them

02:39.944 --> 02:41.979
and everybody they ever
smiled at in the fucking ground.

02:42.112 --> 02:44.114
But I can't do that
'cause it's Kane.

02:45.816 --> 02:47.685
It's delicate.

02:47.818 --> 02:49.620
If Leon says he can handle it,

02:49.754 --> 02:51.356
I say we let him try.

02:51.489 --> 02:52.890
JEROME:
Motherfuckers try
to come kill us,

02:53.023 --> 02:55.326
you want to make a goddamn deal.

02:55.460 --> 02:57.362
Y'all niggas go ahead and
make the fucking deals, okay?

02:57.495 --> 02:59.564
I'm gonna go find Peaches,
and after that,

02:59.697 --> 03:01.899
I'm gonna go get
that bitch-ass nigga Kane.

03:02.032 --> 03:03.568
This shit ain't just about Kane.

03:03.701 --> 03:05.403
It's about Black bodies
in the street.

03:05.536 --> 03:07.572
It's our people
wiping each other out.

03:07.705 --> 03:09.540
*

03:14.545 --> 03:16.581
-And if Kane ain't interested
in your deal?
-(door opens)

03:16.714 --> 03:19.016
Like I said,
I'll do the shit myself.

03:27.725 --> 03:28.993
(door closes)

03:29.126 --> 03:31.028
*

03:39.036 --> 03:42.507
PARISSA:
Sure you don't want me
to take a look at your face?

03:42.640 --> 03:44.842
GUSTAVO:
No, I'm fine.

03:44.975 --> 03:47.378
-You sound like him.
-(Teddy grunts)

03:47.512 --> 03:48.846
I keep telling him,
he leaves now,

03:48.979 --> 03:50.715
his stitches won't hold.

03:50.848 --> 03:52.082
I need to go.

03:54.585 --> 03:56.086
Start moving the bricks out
to your trunk.

03:56.220 --> 03:58.756
-They're in the kitchen.
-Okay.

03:58.889 --> 04:01.526
And he's risking infection.

04:08.065 --> 04:10.501
Thank you.

04:14.939 --> 04:16.441
(Teddy exhales sharply)

04:17.942 --> 04:21.111
I looked into your wallet
while you were unconscious.

04:22.279 --> 04:25.115
It says your real name
is Theodore.

04:28.052 --> 04:29.787
You know, if you're asking me

04:29.920 --> 04:31.589
if I wish you hadn't gone
through my things,

04:31.722 --> 04:33.624
the answer is yes.

04:33.758 --> 04:35.025
I like Theodore.

04:36.026 --> 04:38.729
It suits you more than Thomas.

04:38.863 --> 04:40.998
See you soon.

04:41.131 --> 04:43.434
(door closes)

04:43.568 --> 04:45.135
VERONIQUE:
...but we're moving
international funds

04:45.269 --> 04:47.104
from two separate countries,
so...

04:48.238 --> 04:50.641
All we're asking for
is 48 hours.

04:52.076 --> 04:53.644
Yeah.

04:53.778 --> 04:54.979
I understand.

05:01.118 --> 05:02.620
You show them
the proof of funds?

05:02.753 --> 05:04.522
Yes.

05:04.655 --> 05:05.923
The city doesn't care.

05:06.056 --> 05:07.825
It just looks unprofessional
to get an extension.

05:08.993 --> 05:12.630
If we miss this new deadline,
they're gonna reopen the bid.

05:12.763 --> 05:14.532
Without us.

05:14.665 --> 05:16.033
Where's Mama at?

05:16.166 --> 05:17.535
She should be
on the bankers' asses.

05:17.668 --> 05:18.703
Coffee with a friend, I think.

05:18.836 --> 05:20.538
-Friend? What friend?
-Yes.

05:20.671 --> 05:22.106
(sighs)

05:23.307 --> 05:25.009
Look, I'll handle the bankers,
okay?

05:25.142 --> 05:26.677
And I'll work the phone...

05:26.811 --> 05:28.513
You okay?

05:28.646 --> 05:30.548
Mm-hmm.

05:30.681 --> 05:32.149
-Just cramps.
-You sure?

05:32.282 --> 05:33.851
You want me to call the doctor
or something?

05:33.984 --> 05:35.720
-No, no, I already spoke to her.
-(pager beeping)

05:35.853 --> 05:37.555
What did she say?

05:37.688 --> 05:39.890
That the time between ten
and 12 weeks is a delicate one.

05:40.024 --> 05:41.892
We just have to wait it out.

05:42.026 --> 05:43.594
Delicate? Delicate how?

05:44.862 --> 05:46.664
After 12 weeks,
there's less chance

05:46.797 --> 05:48.533
of a miscarriage, so...

05:48.666 --> 05:50.167
-Of a miscarriage? Oh, hell no.
-Yeah.

05:50.300 --> 05:52.837
It's fine. This is how it goes.

05:52.970 --> 05:54.905
-(pager beeping)
-We just have to hope
things are gonna work out

05:55.039 --> 05:56.574
how they're supposed to.

05:56.707 --> 05:58.909
What the hell that
supposed to mean?

05:59.043 --> 06:00.745
We're supposed to be
having a baby.

06:00.878 --> 06:01.912
What you talking about?

06:02.046 --> 06:03.748
Franklin, we got a lot of stuff

06:03.881 --> 06:05.650
-to deal with right now, okay?
-(pager beeping, vibrating)

06:05.783 --> 06:07.051
Who keeps paging you?
Who is this?

06:08.653 --> 06:10.220
Teddy.

06:11.689 --> 06:13.090
CIA Teddy?

06:13.223 --> 06:15.192
Who's gonna end up killing you
if the gangsters don't, Teddy?

06:15.325 --> 06:17.061
See, now you're starting
to sound like my mother.

06:18.629 --> 06:19.930
You want to see
your girlfriend upset?

06:20.064 --> 06:21.599
-You compare her to your mother.
-I'm serious.

06:21.732 --> 06:23.501
Y'all two been talking
about this shit?

06:23.634 --> 06:24.935
Franklin, we're wasting time.

06:25.069 --> 06:26.537
This deal is slipping away.

06:26.671 --> 06:27.938
-(pager beeping, vibrating)
-And I've worked too hard,

06:28.072 --> 06:29.607
and I won't let that happen.

06:29.740 --> 06:31.676
So you take care of this,

06:31.809 --> 06:34.044
and I'll take care of my end.

06:36.080 --> 06:38.649
(pager beeping, vibrating)

06:43.854 --> 06:45.623
(tires squealing in distance)

06:45.756 --> 06:46.924
This doesn't make any sense.

06:47.057 --> 06:48.726
How would they have
known the location

06:48.859 --> 06:50.628
of all three drops,
especially ours,

06:50.761 --> 06:52.930
if there wasn't somebody
on the inside?

06:53.063 --> 06:54.632
(horns honking in distance)

06:54.765 --> 06:56.166
Couldn't say.

06:57.434 --> 07:00.004
Like, not even back at the club,
when everyone was there?

07:01.105 --> 07:04.975
Nel. La Xiamara y yo left,

07:05.109 --> 07:07.945
when I had to take care
of all this.

07:08.078 --> 07:09.980
(tires screeching in distance)

07:10.114 --> 07:13.718
His mother just cleaned it up
nomÃ¡s.

07:14.852 --> 07:16.186
Whose mother?

07:18.055 --> 07:19.123
-His.
-(car door opens)

07:25.395 --> 07:27.164
(grunts softly)

07:27.297 --> 07:29.667
Damn.

07:29.800 --> 07:32.336
Out of the three of us,
I don't know who looks worse.

07:32.469 --> 07:34.304
Oso.

07:35.973 --> 07:37.608
What the fuck happened?

07:37.742 --> 07:39.076
Was that motherfucker Peaches
gave us all up.

07:39.209 --> 07:40.244
Was an inside job.

07:40.377 --> 07:42.747
You didn't see that coming?

07:42.880 --> 07:44.915
Nobody saw it coming.

07:45.049 --> 07:46.917
Goddamn it, sloppy as hell.

07:47.051 --> 07:48.919
FRANKLIN:
Bottom line is,
I'm taking care of it.

07:49.053 --> 07:50.588
-We know what happened.
-By what?

07:50.721 --> 07:52.857
Like, by bringing strangers
to my drops?

07:52.990 --> 07:54.925
He's former Mossad, all right?

07:55.059 --> 07:56.661
Upping the security.

07:58.495 --> 07:59.697
Can he spot a tail?

07:59.830 --> 08:01.031
He trained
in counterintelligence?

08:01.165 --> 08:02.166
What's your background?

08:02.299 --> 08:04.602
FRANKLIN:
Look, I get it, all right?

08:04.735 --> 08:06.036
This one's on me. I fucked up.

08:06.170 --> 08:08.072
But I'm-a fix it.

08:10.741 --> 08:13.644
That's not something
that I can trust anymore.

08:13.778 --> 08:16.180
So we got to make
a few changes around here.

08:16.313 --> 08:18.182
First, I'll set the meets
from now on.

08:18.315 --> 08:19.283
I'll call you
a few minutes before

08:19.416 --> 08:20.818
with time and location.

08:20.951 --> 08:22.019
And second,

08:22.152 --> 08:23.788
you will come alone.

08:23.921 --> 08:25.790
No one else.

08:25.923 --> 08:26.991
(trunk slams shut)

08:30.761 --> 08:31.729
I need security.

08:31.862 --> 08:34.064
I'm your security.

08:34.198 --> 08:36.634
Why don't you send Oso?
I'll send one of my people.

08:36.767 --> 08:38.235
Because that's not
what I'm telling you to do.

08:38.368 --> 08:40.070
You fucked up. I got shot.

08:40.204 --> 08:42.139
I will tell you how this goes
from here on out.

08:42.272 --> 08:43.908
You hear me?

08:44.041 --> 08:45.676
And another thing is,
you're getting...

08:45.810 --> 08:47.311
way too high-profile
for my taste.

08:47.444 --> 08:48.846
This real estate company
of yours,

08:48.979 --> 08:50.981
you got some kind of prize
from the city?

08:51.115 --> 08:53.918
Yeah, it's a legit business,
built from my mother's company.

08:54.051 --> 08:55.219
Right. And then
there's your mother,

08:55.352 --> 08:56.987
who is back from Cuba, I hear.

08:57.121 --> 08:58.388
She decided it was time.

08:58.522 --> 09:00.090
-That's not the deal.
-I know.

09:00.224 --> 09:01.926
My mother,
the real estate business,

09:02.059 --> 09:04.194
-it's not connected to this...
-Everything is connected!

09:04.328 --> 09:06.931
Open your fucking eyes, man!

09:07.064 --> 09:08.833
It takes one wrong person
connecting

09:08.966 --> 09:11.201
your fucking real estate company
to my business,

09:11.335 --> 09:13.470
and we're fucked, it's all over.

09:15.405 --> 09:17.842
Pull out of the deal.

09:17.975 --> 09:19.844
No. It's too late for that.

09:19.977 --> 09:21.211
Draw too much attention.

09:25.015 --> 09:26.984
No more high-profile buys.

09:28.418 --> 09:29.954
You want to buy up
the whole fucking ghetto?

09:30.087 --> 09:31.789
I don't care, be my guest.

09:31.922 --> 09:34.191
But you will not make
one more move

09:34.324 --> 09:36.861
that draws attention
to the two of us.

09:36.994 --> 09:39.063
Is that understood?

09:40.597 --> 09:43.033
Uh-huh.

09:46.336 --> 09:47.437
(quietly):
Motherfucker.

09:53.277 --> 09:54.945
TINA:
Number 92.

09:55.079 --> 09:57.114
Yes, ma'am. Here I come.

09:59.950 --> 10:01.852
(quiet chatter)

10:03.888 --> 10:05.289
(clattering)

10:07.958 --> 10:09.326
Uh, sorry.

10:09.459 --> 10:11.095
RECEPTIONIST:
Veterans Administration.

10:11.228 --> 10:12.797
How can I help you?

10:14.398 --> 10:15.966
Excuse me.

10:16.100 --> 10:17.968
-How you doing?
-Hi.

10:18.102 --> 10:20.004
How I go about looking for
a friend of mine?

10:20.137 --> 10:21.305
He's a vet and he gone missing.

10:21.438 --> 10:22.740
I know he come here.

10:22.873 --> 10:24.341
What's his name?

10:24.474 --> 10:26.110
Peaches.

10:28.112 --> 10:29.479
DeJohn Hill.

10:31.982 --> 10:33.851
Address off of 79th.

10:33.984 --> 10:35.085
He's missing.

10:39.156 --> 10:41.992
He was here last week,
but I can't tell you any more.

10:42.126 --> 10:43.493
The records are confidential.

10:48.165 --> 10:50.968
He's an old friend.

10:51.101 --> 10:53.337
We worried about him.

10:53.470 --> 10:56.006
I-I can make a donation.

10:57.307 --> 11:00.044
Give me a telephone number,
address, anything.

11:00.177 --> 11:01.812
Any way I can track him down.

11:01.946 --> 11:04.014
Oh, I-I don't know...

11:06.116 --> 11:07.417
(scoffs)

11:08.585 --> 11:10.087
(softly):
There you go.

11:12.189 --> 11:14.124
(paper rustling)

11:15.292 --> 11:17.394
Your friend was here
to see Dr. Evans

11:17.527 --> 11:18.395
in the clinic up the hall.

11:18.528 --> 11:20.530
Thank you.

11:25.035 --> 11:27.304
(phone ringing)

11:34.711 --> 11:36.546
(quiet chatter)

11:44.221 --> 11:45.990
You need to make an appointment.

11:46.123 --> 11:47.424
If it's an emergency,
you should go to the...

11:47.557 --> 11:49.927
It ain't for me. I'm looking
for a friend of mine.

11:50.060 --> 11:52.229
Lady in the front said
he came by to see you.

11:52.362 --> 11:53.931
(groans)

11:54.064 --> 11:55.132
You all right?

11:58.002 --> 11:59.103
I'm fine.

11:59.236 --> 12:00.637
Let me see that.

12:03.140 --> 12:04.508
Come on.

12:08.078 --> 12:10.147
(Jerome sighs)

12:11.581 --> 12:12.950
Who is your friend?

12:13.083 --> 12:14.451
You saw him last week.

12:14.584 --> 12:16.420
DeJohn Hill.

12:16.553 --> 12:18.088
Go by Peaches.

12:19.656 --> 12:20.590
Wall or face?

12:20.724 --> 12:22.092
What?

12:22.226 --> 12:24.528
You broke two metacarpals.

12:24.661 --> 12:26.931
Did you punch a wall or a face?

12:28.165 --> 12:29.633
Face.

12:29.766 --> 12:31.635
There's nothing I can do
about it but splint it

12:31.768 --> 12:34.004
and wrap it up.

12:35.605 --> 12:37.007
Thanks.

12:39.176 --> 12:40.978
What about DeJohn?

12:41.111 --> 12:43.347
I saw a lot of guys last week.

12:45.015 --> 12:46.583
What's he look like?

12:46.716 --> 12:48.886
Big, tall.

12:49.019 --> 12:50.220
Cornrows, light-skinned nigga.

12:50.354 --> 12:51.922
Light eyes.

12:52.056 --> 12:54.158
Light eyes, huh?

12:54.291 --> 12:56.393
If I did see him,
I don't remember.

12:56.526 --> 12:57.995
Sorry.

12:58.128 --> 13:00.330
But you know what?

13:00.464 --> 13:03.000
You need to worry more
about yourself.

13:03.133 --> 13:05.235
Where did you serve?

13:05.369 --> 13:07.071
For me, it was Korea.

13:07.204 --> 13:08.538
Army.

13:11.308 --> 13:14.411
I done took up too much
of your time.

13:14.544 --> 13:16.914
Sorry for intruding on you.

13:17.047 --> 13:18.515
I didn't mean to, uh...

13:18.648 --> 13:20.750
to interrupt your break.

13:22.719 --> 13:24.354
-Something to take care of you.
-No, no, no.

13:24.488 --> 13:26.023
I don't want that.

13:26.156 --> 13:29.159
I'm sorry I couldn't help you
with your friend.

13:30.760 --> 13:33.597
But I recommend counseling.

13:33.730 --> 13:35.966
It's free here.

13:36.100 --> 13:37.201
You've been through a lot.

13:37.334 --> 13:39.269
There's no shame
in admitting it.

13:40.670 --> 13:42.339
Asking for help.

13:45.842 --> 13:47.544
Hmm.

13:47.677 --> 13:49.513

13:53.283 --> 13:54.218
(door closes)

13:54.351 --> 13:56.220
(quiet chatter)

13:56.353 --> 13:58.155
(phone rings)

14:06.296 --> 14:07.631
Jerome?

14:09.499 --> 14:11.101
Oh, shit, man.
I thought that was you.

14:12.136 --> 14:13.737
It's Oakley.

14:13.870 --> 14:15.505
Aw, come on, man.

14:15.639 --> 14:18.308
We met a couple years ago,
with Peaches.

14:18.442 --> 14:20.010
Remember that house party
our buddy Travis threw?

14:20.144 --> 14:21.645
That guy fell
into the empty pool?

14:21.778 --> 14:23.013
Oh, shit. Yeah.

14:23.147 --> 14:24.414
(chuckles):
Yeah.

14:24.548 --> 14:25.415
Motherfucker bleeding
all over the place.

14:25.549 --> 14:26.483
-All over the place.
-Yeah.

14:27.717 --> 14:29.586
Hey, man, I overheard you saying
you're looking for Peaches.

14:29.719 --> 14:31.255
Yeah, that nigga done went MIA.

14:31.388 --> 14:33.423
I was with him
literally last week.

14:33.557 --> 14:34.992
Huh.

14:35.125 --> 14:36.326
Any idea where he at now?

14:36.460 --> 14:37.761
I mean, his family,
they're worried sick.

14:37.894 --> 14:40.264
Yeah, I got a pretty good idea.

14:40.397 --> 14:43.200
-I can take you to him.
-VINCENT: Oakley.

14:43.333 --> 14:45.735
-Coming?
-Yeah, yeah. One second, please.

14:45.869 --> 14:47.671
(whispers):
Just hang with me.
I'll take you to him.

14:47.804 --> 14:50.007
He's probably with Curtis.
They served together.

14:50.140 --> 14:51.708
No, no, we can go right now.

14:51.841 --> 14:54.178
Uh, just give me
like 30 minutes, yeah?

14:55.179 --> 14:57.214
*

15:03.387 --> 15:05.189
(phone rings)

15:06.156 --> 15:08.025
(upbeat music playing faintly)

15:08.158 --> 15:10.727
SERVER:
24. Pickup window.

15:17.534 --> 15:20.370
Awful brave of you, nigga,
coming up here all alone.

15:22.739 --> 15:24.541
We said alone, no guns.

15:24.674 --> 15:26.610
Figure I could trust you.

15:26.743 --> 15:28.278
Guess we'll see.

15:29.713 --> 15:31.415
(sighs)

15:31.548 --> 15:34.051
So, Lee, here we are.

15:34.184 --> 15:36.553
You gonna tell me some shit
I don't already know?

15:38.788 --> 15:41.058
Before we all kill each other,

15:41.191 --> 15:43.160
figured you should at least
know what really happened.

15:43.293 --> 15:44.828
I don't want to hear
any excuses, Lee.

15:44.961 --> 15:47.797
I ain't got no excuses.

15:47.931 --> 15:50.234
Kev betrayed us.

15:50.367 --> 15:53.237
Went behind our backs
to the Mexicans.

15:53.370 --> 15:56.473
Yeah, way I heard, he did that
shit to get revenge for Delroy.

15:58.775 --> 16:02.312
Mexicans killed Delroy
for slinging in their territory.

16:02.446 --> 16:05.349
And the vato Kev was about
to kill was a Mexican OG,

16:05.482 --> 16:06.850
would've wiped us all out.

16:06.983 --> 16:08.818
Including you up in Tehachapi.

16:10.987 --> 16:12.656
(scoffs)

16:13.957 --> 16:16.826
But we ain't mean to kill him.

16:16.960 --> 16:19.163
We was just trying to stop him,
and it went wrong.

16:19.996 --> 16:21.698
It went way fucking wrong.

16:21.831 --> 16:24.601
I know. We fucked up.
I'll own up to that.

16:25.769 --> 16:28.505
Problem is, now so have you.

16:28.638 --> 16:30.707
If you'd have just
came at me and Franklin,

16:30.840 --> 16:32.442
that'd be one thing, but
you came for the whole family,

16:32.576 --> 16:33.510
and now they all want blood.

16:33.643 --> 16:35.812
(chuckles) Okay.

16:40.517 --> 16:42.352
You know, when I was little,

16:42.486 --> 16:45.489
all I wanted was to be like you.

16:45.622 --> 16:47.557
Way you was cool with everybody.

16:47.691 --> 16:49.493
Always had a fine woman
on your arm.

16:49.626 --> 16:51.728
Saw the way you handled shit,
and thought...

16:51.861 --> 16:53.497
that's how I want to be.

16:54.664 --> 16:56.333
But I had that temper.

16:56.466 --> 16:58.835
Was always getting into trouble.

16:58.968 --> 17:00.904
Yeah.

17:01.037 --> 17:04.374
Raging, lawless Leon.

17:04.508 --> 17:06.743
Couldn't tell you shit.

17:06.876 --> 17:08.878
Never thought you'd make it
out of Wayside.

17:09.012 --> 17:10.714
And I wouldn't have,
hadn't been for you

17:10.847 --> 17:12.516
hooking me up with
them Western Tribe brothers.

17:12.649 --> 17:15.219
That's right, because I
treated you like fucking family.

17:15.352 --> 17:18.755
I know, and I ain't gonna
ever forget that.

17:18.888 --> 17:22.259
So let me help you with yours.

17:22.392 --> 17:25.895
You're respected, connected.

17:26.029 --> 17:28.165
Wouldn't believe
the amount of money you can make

17:28.298 --> 17:29.833
off this powder,
and we got an endless supply.

17:29.966 --> 17:31.568
(chuckles)

17:33.537 --> 17:36.206
Oh, shit, so we talking business
now, Lee, huh?

17:36.340 --> 17:38.408
That's what the fuck we doing?

17:38.542 --> 17:40.244
I figured, if anybody'd
be trying to make peace,

17:40.377 --> 17:41.845
it'd be Franklin.

17:45.749 --> 17:47.917
What happened, man?

17:48.918 --> 17:51.888
You gone and changed on me, Lee?

17:52.989 --> 17:56.326
You done really been through it,
huh?

17:57.527 --> 17:59.529
I would've taken that bullet
instead of Kev.

17:59.663 --> 18:00.730
I promise you that.

18:01.865 --> 18:04.834
He was my family, too,
and I ain't got much left.

18:06.836 --> 18:09.606
We can squash this beef here,
right now.

18:11.508 --> 18:14.544
If you really want to look
after your family,

18:14.678 --> 18:15.945
this is the way.

18:16.079 --> 18:18.282
*

18:21.618 --> 18:25.789
GREGORY:
I keep thinking about Khe Sanh,

18:25.922 --> 18:27.957
where I busted my cherry.

18:29.626 --> 18:31.828
I ain't never been
out of Houston.

18:31.961 --> 18:35.599
Suddenly, I'm in the jungle.

18:35.732 --> 18:37.601
Ain't that about a bitch.

18:39.035 --> 18:41.838
I was just trying to stay alive

18:41.971 --> 18:46.576
and had three kills
my first week in country.

18:46.710 --> 18:49.913
Didn't sleep for days.

18:50.046 --> 18:52.316
Shit...

18:52.449 --> 18:54.451
Still have nightmares about it.

18:56.453 --> 18:59.689
For the next six months,

18:59.823 --> 19:03.860
we were... hunted,

19:03.993 --> 19:06.396
taken out one by one.

19:07.997 --> 19:10.534
Every day, every step,

19:10.667 --> 19:13.270
wondering where the next shot
was gonna come from,

19:13.403 --> 19:15.004
if it was your time.

19:16.673 --> 19:21.445
Now I'm just so goddamn angry
all the time.

19:21.578 --> 19:25.014
(trembling breaths)
I-I just can't.

19:27.183 --> 19:29.686
I can't take no more of this.

19:38.528 --> 19:40.864
It's court-mandated,
part of my probation.

19:40.997 --> 19:42.566
Tell the judge
you're a vet with flashbacks,

19:42.699 --> 19:44.868
they go easier on you.

19:46.470 --> 19:48.538
Some of them niggas
ain't faking it.

19:49.806 --> 19:51.641
Yeah, I know.

19:51.775 --> 19:53.677
Those are the guys trying
to do something about it, too.

19:53.810 --> 19:55.879
Guys who don't?

19:56.012 --> 19:58.014
(imitates gunshot)

20:00.650 --> 20:02.419
You can park right here.

20:02.552 --> 20:04.388
(birds calling)

20:12.562 --> 20:14.864
You can hang out in the garden.

20:17.901 --> 20:20.604
Listen, man, um...

20:20.737 --> 20:23.072
I-I need some scratch.

20:24.908 --> 20:26.743
Just like a hundred.

20:28.177 --> 20:31.515
The fuck does this have to do
with finding Peaches?

20:31.648 --> 20:33.617
Well, I know Curtis won't
open his door for nothing.

20:33.750 --> 20:36.486
And my connect here
gets his smack direct from Asia.

20:45.895 --> 20:47.931
(water trickling nearby)

20:53.036 --> 20:55.038

20:59.175 --> 21:01.611
(takes deep breath)

21:01.745 --> 21:02.979
(Cissy sighs)

21:03.112 --> 21:05.449
Where you been?

21:05.582 --> 21:07.451
Running your errands.

21:07.584 --> 21:08.718
Sorry.

21:10.253 --> 21:13.790
(grunts) Made collections
at the Arlington place.

21:15.725 --> 21:19.463
Shouldn't you have security with
you when you do stuff like that?

21:19.596 --> 21:21.965
They're not after me, Franklin.

21:23.099 --> 21:25.469
Veronique handling the banks?

21:25.602 --> 21:27.471
Yeah, she's working on it.

21:27.604 --> 21:31.107
Went to First National
to speed up the transfers.

21:31.240 --> 21:32.942
Did you say something to her?

21:33.076 --> 21:35.078
About what?

21:35.211 --> 21:37.447
Teddy.

21:37.581 --> 21:40.083
All of this, other life.

21:42.586 --> 21:43.987
I did.

21:44.120 --> 21:46.690
Which was?

21:46.823 --> 21:48.425
What you should've said
from the start.

21:48.558 --> 21:49.959
You have a problem,
you come to me.

21:50.093 --> 21:52.128
Okay? You don't just go
behind my back.

21:54.831 --> 21:55.799
Behind your back?

21:55.932 --> 21:57.634
Mm-hmm.

21:57.767 --> 21:59.636
What would've happened
if she had gotten shot?

21:59.769 --> 22:01.037
Or worse?

22:01.170 --> 22:04.040
-(sighs)
-She needs to face that reality.

22:04.173 --> 22:05.975
-You do, too.
-What are you doing to me?

22:06.109 --> 22:08.978
I'm trying to help you,
Franklin.

22:09.112 --> 22:11.981
But, for some reason, you want
to keep me at arm's length.

22:12.115 --> 22:14.851
You listen to me,
you want to help me...

22:14.984 --> 22:17.554
help take the burden
off my shoulders?

22:17.687 --> 22:19.889
Then help with
the downtown property.

22:20.023 --> 22:22.559
Help with this.
Help with the banking.

22:22.692 --> 22:24.193
Help keep the peace

22:24.327 --> 22:26.195
instead of making everything
worse.

22:27.664 --> 22:29.198
(scoffs)

22:37.040 --> 22:38.875
(sighs)

22:39.008 --> 22:41.044
(birds chirping)

22:47.984 --> 22:50.019
(wind chimes tinkling)

23:05.068 --> 23:07.070
(exhales softly)

23:13.677 --> 23:15.344
(takes deep breath)

23:19.215 --> 23:21.084
*

23:26.923 --> 23:28.992
(lively chatter)

23:37.767 --> 23:39.636
New place?

23:39.769 --> 23:41.805
Out of the way?

23:41.938 --> 23:44.908
Not really sure what
you're trying to tell me here.

23:45.041 --> 23:47.210
Trying to tell you
this ain't business as usual.

23:48.878 --> 23:50.814
Hey, nurse.

23:50.947 --> 23:53.116
Whatever she's having.

23:55.218 --> 23:56.820
So, um...

23:56.953 --> 23:59.923
hearing rumors about
who came after you.

24:00.056 --> 24:02.125
I got more than rumors.

24:03.126 --> 24:05.261
Name. Where he stay.

24:06.796 --> 24:08.832
He only been out of prison
for a few months,

24:08.965 --> 24:10.066
so the address might be
temporary.

24:16.305 --> 24:18.675
So, what you looking for?
You want me to bust him?

24:18.808 --> 24:20.209
Send him back?

24:26.082 --> 24:27.751
I'll pay.

24:27.884 --> 24:29.185
Yeah, that might be
too expensive.

24:29.318 --> 24:31.354
Even for you, beautiful.

24:31.487 --> 24:33.322
(sighs)

24:37.994 --> 24:40.063
Whoa, whoa.
What, you just gonna leave?

24:41.230 --> 24:42.265
(softly):
All right.

24:44.834 --> 24:47.003
This is what I need.

24:47.136 --> 24:49.272
Now, either you can get it done,
or you can't.

24:49.405 --> 24:51.708
Yeah, I ain't say
I couldn't get it done.

24:51.841 --> 24:53.176
I just said it's gonna cost you.

24:53.309 --> 24:55.712
Hmm. Well, maybe
instead of being cute,

24:55.845 --> 24:57.113
you give me a number.

24:59.983 --> 25:01.918
(Buckley sighs)

25:05.154 --> 25:06.723
250's a number.

25:06.856 --> 25:08.057
250's a hand job.

25:08.191 --> 25:09.693
Don't tease me.

25:09.826 --> 25:11.227
50 now, 50 when it's done.

25:11.360 --> 25:12.829
One hundred.

25:12.962 --> 25:15.064
And we go on a real date.

25:15.198 --> 25:16.399
Seventy-five.

25:16.532 --> 25:18.367
And no.

25:19.936 --> 25:24.073
That's $150,000 to kill
some nigga just out the joint,

25:24.207 --> 25:25.909
who your buddies is gonna
probably gun down

25:26.042 --> 25:27.376
in the next couple years anyway.

25:29.345 --> 25:31.480
Or I can find somebody else.

25:32.515 --> 25:34.217
Like who?

25:34.350 --> 25:36.653
(chuckles)

25:36.786 --> 25:39.055
You think you're the only cop
in L.A. with his hand out?

25:41.557 --> 25:43.059
(inhales sharply)

25:45.061 --> 25:46.896
-Okay.
-Hmm.

25:47.030 --> 25:48.832
-I'll look into it.
-Hmm.

25:48.965 --> 25:51.735
Well, don't take too long,
beautiful.

25:55.071 --> 25:57.140
Thanks for the drink.

26:15.524 --> 26:17.093
(door opens)

26:19.195 --> 26:21.030
(door closes)

26:26.002 --> 26:27.871
(electrical buzzing)

26:44.453 --> 26:46.890
It's a wireless transmitter.

26:47.023 --> 26:49.959
Corresponding receiver.

26:50.093 --> 26:51.895
Uh, the telephone taps.

26:52.028 --> 26:53.162
We got one for the telephone,

26:53.296 --> 26:57.300
and these are for his car.

26:57.433 --> 26:59.502
Listen, I'm gonna need your help
with this,

26:59.635 --> 27:03.306
'cause installing some of these
is a two-man job.

27:05.374 --> 27:06.910
(Gustavo sighs)

27:08.878 --> 27:10.379
Franklin?

27:11.547 --> 27:13.416
He's gotten lazy.

27:16.552 --> 27:19.222
Can't afford to take
any more chances.

27:24.393 --> 27:26.095
Listen...

27:28.164 --> 27:30.767
About the other day,

27:30.900 --> 27:32.468
taking off like that...

27:33.970 --> 27:35.839
I was hit, you know.

27:35.972 --> 27:38.307
I mean, it was kind of like
my brain just...

27:41.010 --> 27:42.278
I had to get out of there,

27:42.411 --> 27:44.113
but I shouldn't have left you
like that.

27:45.949 --> 27:47.516
I'm sorry.

27:49.252 --> 27:51.120
I'm glad you're okay.

27:57.927 --> 27:59.595
(transmitters beep)

28:04.667 --> 28:06.535
(quiet chatter)

28:09.638 --> 28:11.875
(phone rings)

28:12.976 --> 28:15.011
(speaking indistinctly)

28:26.289 --> 28:28.157
*

28:42.471 --> 28:44.340
*

28:53.382 --> 28:54.951
LOUIE:
What are the terms?

28:55.084 --> 28:57.086
He's gonna use his connect
to start at ten keys a week.

28:58.387 --> 29:00.189
So you got him making money
for you now?

29:00.323 --> 29:02.158
Makes the world go round.

29:04.093 --> 29:06.195
-And you trust him?
-LEON: End of the day,

29:06.329 --> 29:08.197
he just want to look out
for his family.

29:17.040 --> 29:19.575
Got the targets off our backs.

29:19.708 --> 29:22.311
There's peace in the land.

29:22.445 --> 29:24.280
That's good enough for now.

29:25.748 --> 29:27.616
(dogs barking in distance)

29:45.634 --> 29:46.970
(chuckles softly)

29:47.103 --> 29:48.737
They must all be down.

30:09.492 --> 30:11.961
(exhales sharply) Curtis?

30:12.095 --> 30:13.997
It's Oakley.

30:14.797 --> 30:17.366
What the fuck?

30:17.500 --> 30:19.035
You think I don't know

30:19.168 --> 30:20.769
when someone
running game on me, nigga?

30:21.770 --> 30:23.606
I am the game.

30:26.342 --> 30:28.177
(dogs continue barking
in distance)

30:37.853 --> 30:39.655
-Oh, shit.
-Hey, man, do something.
He's got a fucking...

30:39.788 --> 30:40.723
Shut up.

30:40.856 --> 30:42.458
Is Peaches here,

30:42.591 --> 30:44.160
or this all part of the setup?

30:44.293 --> 30:45.661
You talk now,
or I'm-a start shooting!

30:45.794 --> 30:48.164
Yes, yes!
He was here all the time.

30:50.699 --> 30:54.137
You telling me that Peaches is
a goddamn junkie?

30:55.204 --> 30:56.372
You really didn't know?

30:58.341 --> 31:01.010
He was just looking for a way
to escape his pain, man.

31:01.144 --> 31:02.511
(grunts, groans)

31:05.148 --> 31:06.415
Where he at now?

31:06.549 --> 31:09.018
He said, if he could
pull it off, he'd have to run.

31:09.152 --> 31:11.154
-He talked a lot about Thailand.
-CURTIS: Burma.

31:16.159 --> 31:17.160
JEROME:
Some motherfucking bullshit.

31:19.162 --> 31:20.163
(bottle rattles)

31:23.166 --> 31:25.501
(groaning)

31:25.634 --> 31:27.503
*

31:45.354 --> 31:47.756
JEROME:
Son of a bitch.

31:53.762 --> 31:56.099
What a waste of life.

31:59.168 --> 32:00.536
(door opens)

32:06.342 --> 32:07.643
So, how many times

32:07.776 --> 32:09.712
are you going to make me
redo these?

32:12.548 --> 32:15.551
I don't know.

32:15.684 --> 32:19.288
Maybe you just want an excuse
to come back and see me.

32:20.689 --> 32:24.560
I knew you liked me, in Tehran.

32:24.693 --> 32:28.897
I always wondered if you were
going to try something.

32:30.566 --> 32:34.770
Especially that weekend,
in Shemshak.

32:38.574 --> 32:40.443
-Methar was there.
-(chuckles)

32:40.576 --> 32:41.777
Yes.

32:41.910 --> 32:44.313
And you needed him.

32:44.447 --> 32:49.085
Probably a big no-no
in the CIA handbook,

32:49.218 --> 32:51.820
sleeping with your asset's wife.

32:55.724 --> 32:58.094
You think you'll ever
go back to Tehran?

32:58.227 --> 33:00.096
No.

33:00.229 --> 33:01.564
It's too different.

33:03.632 --> 33:05.634
So am I.

33:05.768 --> 33:08.337
So are you.

33:08.471 --> 33:10.173
(groans)

33:10.939 --> 33:13.309
(sighs)

33:13.442 --> 33:16.945
You were so green and pure
back then.

33:17.980 --> 33:20.649
So by the book.

33:20.783 --> 33:22.518
It was sickening.

33:24.353 --> 33:27.156
But kind of sexy.

33:27.290 --> 33:29.192
Mm. But now...

33:29.992 --> 33:31.627
Now?

33:33.296 --> 33:35.864
Now you're just
a grumpy asshole.

33:37.800 --> 33:39.202
And you're a bitch.

33:40.769 --> 33:42.538
I think you like that.

33:45.641 --> 33:48.611
Oh, yes, you do.

33:49.712 --> 33:51.780
Why don't we have some fun?

33:52.815 --> 33:54.850
I'll rip my stitches.

33:54.983 --> 33:56.719
I'll sew them back together.

34:02.691 --> 34:04.760
(breathing heavily)

34:04.893 --> 34:06.762
(Teddy groans)

34:06.895 --> 34:10.199
They really believe Kane's just
gonna go along with anything?

34:10.333 --> 34:12.435
What they believe
don't matter to me no more.

34:12.568 --> 34:15.338
Already told you,
I ain't interested in no deals.

34:15.471 --> 34:18.507
I won't move forward with
Buckley without your support.

34:18.641 --> 34:20.543
Just do what you're gonna do.

34:20.676 --> 34:22.845
I'm gonna protect you.

34:27.516 --> 34:28.684
Sorry about Peaches.

34:28.817 --> 34:30.553
Yeah.

34:33.989 --> 34:35.691
A fucking junkie.

34:35.824 --> 34:37.560
Shit's starting to make sense,

34:37.693 --> 34:39.295
why he did what he did.

34:39.428 --> 34:41.864
I mean, if I was on the needle
and I saw Franklin kill Rob,

34:41.997 --> 34:43.932
I'd be making my exit plan, too.

34:49.605 --> 34:51.740
I need to be worried about you?

34:51.874 --> 34:53.276
No.

34:55.344 --> 34:57.446
But, um...

35:01.950 --> 35:04.287
I need to make some changes.

35:05.888 --> 35:07.556
Okay.

35:07.690 --> 35:09.725
You know I'm gonna be here
for you.

35:09.858 --> 35:12.728
Whenever you need me.

35:12.861 --> 35:15.798
But I got to reconnect back
with my shit.

35:16.965 --> 35:18.634
My people.

35:18.767 --> 35:21.404
Jamming Jerome's, that was
supposed to be the start.

35:21.537 --> 35:23.806
It was never supposed to be
the end.

35:23.939 --> 35:26.475
I need to get back to my plans.

35:26.609 --> 35:28.744
Building businesses
in our neighborhood,

35:28.877 --> 35:30.613
for us,

35:30.746 --> 35:31.980
our people.

35:35.818 --> 35:38.554
I got to do something
with my life.

35:40.589 --> 35:43.926
-(sighs) Man.
-I'm with that. I...

35:44.059 --> 35:46.329
You got to build your dreams,
too.

35:47.496 --> 35:50.299
And as long as you ain't running
off to Thailand or Burma,

35:50.433 --> 35:53.369
-or some shit,
tracking down Peaches, I'm...
-(chuckles)

35:53.502 --> 35:56.472
I'm fine with...
whatever you got to do.

35:57.940 --> 36:00.776
I mean, shit, we can go there
for the honeymoon, right?

36:00.909 --> 36:02.678
Huh?

36:06.148 --> 36:07.015
Yeah.

36:12.455 --> 36:15.391
-(gasps)
-I know what I want.

36:15.524 --> 36:17.693
I know what I got to do.

36:17.826 --> 36:20.028
And the first thing on that list
is you, baby.

36:21.196 --> 36:23.031
So I'll make this official.

36:24.667 --> 36:26.835
I love you.

36:28.804 --> 36:30.873
Louanne...

36:31.006 --> 36:33.041
will you marry me?

36:36.211 --> 36:39.382
-(laughs)
-You will marry me?

36:39.515 --> 36:41.584
Yes, I will marry you.

36:41.717 --> 36:42.985
JEROME:
Come here.

36:43.118 --> 36:44.853
Marry me, baby.

36:44.987 --> 36:46.855
Marry my crazy ass.

36:46.989 --> 36:48.691
(laughs)

36:50.058 --> 36:52.728
International banks
expedited the transfer,

36:52.861 --> 36:54.697
but I want confirmation
from First National

36:54.830 --> 36:56.365
as soon as it opens.

36:56.499 --> 36:59.602
So, we gonna make it or...?

36:59.735 --> 37:00.869
It looks like it.

37:01.003 --> 37:02.605
(both laugh)

37:02.738 --> 37:04.773
Yeah.

37:04.907 --> 37:07.776
Hey, about yesterday,
I-I owe you...

37:07.910 --> 37:09.612
No, no, you're right.

37:09.745 --> 37:11.113
You're right.

37:11.246 --> 37:14.383
I'm-a lock everything down
until we're safe.

37:14.517 --> 37:17.052
You are better off
staying at the spot.

37:18.921 --> 37:20.923
I know.

37:23.759 --> 37:25.561
-How's the cramps?
-Mm.

37:25.694 --> 37:27.029
Not as bad.

37:27.162 --> 37:28.897
Doctor said I just have to
wait it out.

37:29.031 --> 37:32.901
But my nausea has come back
with a vengeance.

37:33.035 --> 37:35.804
What about the threats
against you?

37:35.938 --> 37:38.474
Uh, you know, Leon's handled it.

37:38.607 --> 37:40.876
Kane's gonna work with us.

37:41.009 --> 37:43.145
Why would he do that?

37:43.278 --> 37:45.881
He wants his family
taken care of.

37:46.014 --> 37:47.950
-Hmm.
-Like I do.

37:49.284 --> 37:52.154
Hmm. You believe him?

37:52.287 --> 37:54.823
It's the best play for now.

37:54.957 --> 37:57.092
We do deals here all the time,

37:57.225 --> 37:59.094
and we've seen
when they're in bad faith.

37:59.227 --> 38:00.629
One thing my mother taught me:

38:00.763 --> 38:02.831
You deal with liars
all your life,

38:02.965 --> 38:05.501
you usually suss one out.

38:05.634 --> 38:07.002
*

38:07.135 --> 38:08.837
(Veronique sighs)

38:08.971 --> 38:10.673
TEDDY:
What kind of work you do
for Havemeyer?

38:10.806 --> 38:13.476
WILLIAM:
Off-book jobs
that require discretion.

38:13.609 --> 38:15.043
That's all I can say.

38:17.312 --> 38:21.984
Can anything trace back
to anyone?

38:22.117 --> 38:23.852
If I'm caught for some reason?

38:23.986 --> 38:26.054
No. My cover is
layered and deep.

38:27.990 --> 38:30.859
What do you need from me
to move as quickly as possible?

38:30.993 --> 38:34.029
Bank account numbers, passwords,

38:34.162 --> 38:36.098
records of previous
wire transfers

38:36.231 --> 38:38.100
and all forms
of identity confirmation.

38:39.134 --> 38:40.836
And if I can get all that
for you?

38:40.969 --> 38:42.137
Then I only need 24 hours

38:42.270 --> 38:44.139
to make all
the necessary transfers

38:44.272 --> 38:46.074
and route everything
to untraceable accounts.

38:47.109 --> 38:48.544
Which I will set up in advance.

38:48.677 --> 38:51.580
("The Streets Got My Lady"
by Bill Brandon playing)

38:53.015 --> 38:54.783
* Oh, no, no *

38:54.917 --> 38:56.685
* Hey, baby *

38:56.819 --> 39:01.156
* She was hurt by love... *

39:01.289 --> 39:05.994
(singsongy):
Beauty Louie, beauty Louie.

39:06.128 --> 39:08.130
I got some shit for you.

39:08.263 --> 39:10.799
-I got some shit for you.
-What you got?

39:12.200 --> 39:14.036
Your boy is not even
trying to hide.

39:15.303 --> 39:17.205
Now, it's not gonna be
like going to the corner

39:17.339 --> 39:19.742
for a gallon of milk,
but it's doable.

39:19.875 --> 39:21.076
How soon?

39:21.209 --> 39:24.179
Just need a couple weeks
to set it up.

39:24.312 --> 39:27.650
I'm-a check out the guy's
connections, his routines.

39:27.783 --> 39:29.885
Make sure I got the right guys.

39:31.720 --> 39:32.855
Hold up.

39:33.989 --> 39:36.592
Feel like maybe you forgot
to tell me something.

39:36.725 --> 39:37.760
What?

39:37.893 --> 39:39.895
I thought you two were
already married.

39:41.964 --> 39:45.233
-No.
-Shit. Well,
congratu-motherfucking-lations.

39:45.367 --> 39:46.869
Thank you.

39:47.002 --> 39:49.071
What? Nah, marriage can be
a beautiful thing.

39:49.204 --> 39:52.007
Yeah. Sharon and I had
a great couple of years.

39:52.140 --> 39:55.678
-(scoffs)
-And besides, to be honest,

39:55.811 --> 39:57.846
I find married women
even sexier.

39:57.980 --> 40:00.248
The job, Buckley.
Tell me about the job.

40:05.353 --> 40:08.524
There's only one thing
you really need to know...

40:08.657 --> 40:11.226
is that you got to be sure.

40:11.359 --> 40:13.228
Putting this in motion...

40:15.363 --> 40:17.800
Once you press that button,

40:17.933 --> 40:19.935
there's no turning back.

40:22.170 --> 40:24.940
So, just to be clear...

40:27.943 --> 40:29.645
You sure you want to do this?

40:29.778 --> 40:31.780

("I Can't Stand the Rain"
by Ann Peebles playing)

40:40.723 --> 40:42.825
* I can't stand the rain *

40:42.958 --> 40:44.292
Do it.

40:44.426 --> 40:46.929
* Against my window *

40:49.064 --> 40:51.700
* Bringing back sweet memories *

40:52.968 --> 40:56.004
* Hey, windowpane *

40:56.138 --> 40:58.774
* Do you remember *

41:01.109 --> 41:04.046
* How sweet it used to be? *

41:07.883 --> 41:11.319
* When we was together *

41:13.488 --> 41:16.224
* Everything was so grand *

41:19.394 --> 41:23.699
* Now that we parted *

41:23.832 --> 41:26.001
* There's just one sound *

41:26.134 --> 41:28.871
* That I just can't stand *

41:29.004 --> 41:31.674
* I can't stand the rain *

41:32.808 --> 41:34.810
* Against my window *

41:36.945 --> 41:39.347
* Bringing back sweet memories *

41:40.849 --> 41:43.952
* I can't stand the rain *

41:44.086 --> 41:47.089
* Against my window *

41:48.924 --> 41:51.860
* 'Cause he's not here with me *

41:55.197 --> 41:59.267
* Whoa, empty pillow *

42:01.103 --> 42:04.039
* Where his head used to lay *

42:06.875 --> 42:11.379
* I know you've got
some sweet memories *

42:11.513 --> 42:14.082
* But like the window *

42:14.216 --> 42:19.487
* You ain't got
nothing to say. *
