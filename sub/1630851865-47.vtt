That sound really says happy, doesn't it?

But guys, that sound
didn't come from my toy...

01:11.600 --> 01:14.000

It must be coming from outside!

-Oh, me!
-I'll have one!

01:23.240 --> 01:24.920
[Ollie] I'd like three!

01:25.119 --> 01:26.800
Anyone else want ice cream?

01:26.920 --> 01:29.039
Yeah, I want three. Over here!

01:29.160 --> 01:30.479
No? No one?

01:30.920 --> 01:32.200
Uh, right here!

01:32.320 --> 01:35.320
We want... three ice creams, please.

01:35.960 --> 01:37.600

Hm. Ollie? Where's the ice cream?

01:48.520 --> 01:49.960
I didn't get any!

01:50.080 --> 01:53.199
He didn't see me
because I'm so little. Grr!

01:53.320 --> 01:54.800
Why can't I be big?

01:54.920 --> 01:57.160
Too bad we're not
in the rainforest of Borneo.

01:57.360 --> 01:59.320
Then you could see
what being big is really like.

01:59.440 --> 02:00.280
What do you mean?

02:00.399 --> 02:03.039
Well, my friend
Teeny Tiny Tony lives there.

02:03.160 --> 02:05.960
He's the tiniest snail in the whole world.

02:06.080 --> 02:08.840
Next to him and his friends,
you're a giant!

02:09.320 --> 02:11.640

-Cool!
-Let's go be giant cats in Borneo.

02:17.760 --> 02:19.880
-And get some ice cream there!
-Yeah!

02:28.160 --> 02:29.519
Whee!

<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

02:44.679 --> 02:46.400
[Stanley]
This way to Teeny Tiny Tony's.

02:46.760 --> 02:48.440
I can't wait to be big!

02:48.720 --> 02:52.000
Are you sure you want to be big?
I like being small.

02:52.120 --> 02:54.239
Wait and see
what it's like to be big, Moon.

02:54.359 --> 02:56.519
I bet you'll want to be big forever!

02:56.640 --> 02:58.200
Hi, how are you?

02:58.840 --> 02:59.840
[Ollie] Hm?

03:01.120 --> 03:02.079
Hold on. Moon?

03:03.359 --> 03:06.160
Did you see that elephant? It's tiny!

03:06.280 --> 03:08.480
-<i>Awww.</i>
-And adorable!

03:08.600 --> 03:11.560
Look at those wubiddy-wubiddy cheeks.

03:11.679 --> 03:14.120
But he's all alone, Ollie.
You think he's lost?

03:14.239 --> 03:15.280
I don't know. Let's ask.

03:16.239 --> 03:19.320
Hi there, little guy. Are you lost?

03:19.440 --> 03:21.120
Want me to help you find your mom?

03:21.519 --> 03:22.359
Little guy?

03:22.760 --> 03:24.239
Who you calling little?

03:24.359 --> 03:25.840
Oh, uh, we're sorry.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.600
-We thought you were--
-That I was a baby?

03:28.720 --> 03:30.040
I might look little,

03:30.160 --> 03:32.640
but I can... [trumpets]

03:32.760 --> 03:34.160
Like the big guys!

03:34.280 --> 03:36.560
And don't you forget it.

03:36.679 --> 03:38.519
Of course. Sorry again.

03:38.640 --> 03:39.480
Our mistake.

03:39.600 --> 03:41.760
Oops.
I probably should've explained.

03:41.880 --> 03:45.920
In Borneo, some animals
are just smaller by nature,

03:46.040 --> 03:48.280
like pygmy elephants and squirrels.

03:48.399 --> 03:50.160
Pygmy means mini-sized!

03:50.280 --> 03:53.200
-Oh...
-It all makes sense now...

03:53.320 --> 03:54.679
This place is great!

03:54.799 --> 03:57.560
And even if there's an elephant
in line in front of me,

03:57.679 --> 04:00.679
the ice cream guy will be sure
to see me this time!

04:00.799 --> 04:03.239
-To the ice cream!
<i>-Wooo!</i>

04:05.399 --> 04:06.600
[Ollie] What a place!

04:06.720 --> 04:08.679
I'm a giant cat.

04:08.799 --> 04:12.560
This is Teeny Tiny Tony's
Rainforest Delivery Service.

04:12.679 --> 04:14.959
No package too big, no trip too small!

04:15.079 --> 04:17.519
But where's Teeny Tiny Tony?

04:18.079 --> 04:19.719

04:23.200 --> 04:26.560
Oh, there! What... is that?

04:28.719 --> 04:31.120
I think you mean, "Who is that?"

04:31.599 --> 04:34.560
-Teeny Tiny Tony!
-Stanley!

04:34.680 --> 04:36.200
Ha-ha, hi everybody!

04:36.320 --> 04:38.599
These are my friends, Ollie and Moon.

04:39.320 --> 04:42.280
And, is that a new delivery bike?

04:42.400 --> 04:45.080
Good eye, Stanley! [chuckles]

04:45.200 --> 04:47.599
I made myself a teeny tiny ride

04:47.719 --> 04:50.240
so I can deliver my packages!

04:50.680 --> 04:54.200
Tony, any chance you could
show us where to get ice cream?

04:54.320 --> 04:56.000
Oh, you betcha!

04:56.120 --> 05:00.240
Who's up for the best ice cream in Borneo?

05:01.880 --> 05:04.159
Me, me, me, me!

05:04.280 --> 05:06.919
Ho, ho, ho, ho! No need to shout.

05:07.039 --> 05:08.599
I can hear you just fine.

05:08.719 --> 05:10.240
Right, sorry.

05:10.360 --> 05:12.080
Now, follow me!

05:12.200 --> 05:14.880
On the way, I just have
to pick up a box of bananas

05:15.000 --> 05:18.520
and deliver it to some monkeys
in the giant rainforest!

05:18.640 --> 05:21.560
-Woah.
-There's a giant rainforest?

05:21.680 --> 05:23.479
Lead the way, Tony!

05:27.200 --> 05:29.320
This could take a while...

05:29.880 --> 05:32.280
Want a lift so you can go faster, Tony?

05:32.400 --> 05:33.640
Sure!

05:33.760 --> 05:37.440
Golly! What a view from up here, huh?

05:37.560 --> 05:39.359
[Ollie and Moon giggle]

05:43.520 --> 05:46.800
Where's the giant rainforest?
Will we be there soon?

05:47.320 --> 05:50.440
What do you mean? We're already here!

05:50.560 --> 05:52.080
[gasps] We are?

05:52.200 --> 05:54.919
Sure! Look at all the giant plants.

05:55.039 --> 05:57.599
And the enormous flowers!

06:00.200 --> 06:03.560

you look at it from down here.

06:26.680 --> 06:27.919

06:28.039 --> 06:30.599
She called me giant cat! Me!

06:30.799 --> 06:32.440
We saw you helping Tony.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.320
Would you be able to help us too?

06:34.440 --> 06:36.719
Up to the branch of that tree?

06:37.760 --> 06:40.479
Well, I was on my way
to get some ice cream...

06:40.640 --> 06:43.120
But he'd be happy to stop and help

06:43.240 --> 06:45.719

[sighs] OK.

07:08.599 --> 07:09.479
Ugh.

07:09.599 --> 07:13.320
Being able to reach things
can be pretty exhausting, huh?

07:13.440 --> 07:14.599
A little.

07:14.719 --> 07:17.239
Don't worry, Ollie. We're almost there.

07:17.359 --> 07:18.479
Great.

There. All done with today's deliveries.

07:30.880 --> 07:31.880
[trumpet call]

07:32.080 --> 07:33.880
Just a quick scoot through here

07:34.000 --> 07:38.359
and we'll be at the ice cream cart
in no time! Ha-ha!

07:38.479 --> 07:41.400
-Through there?
-Yup, just follow me!

07:43.400 --> 07:45.840
This is a bit of a squeeze...

07:45.960 --> 07:48.320
Ugh, I should've brought
a smaller shell.

07:48.520 --> 07:51.560
Ugh, you still want to be
a different size, Ollie?

07:51.680 --> 07:54.560
'Cause being little is looking
pretty good right now.

07:55.680 --> 07:57.239

Oh, hello.
I'd like four ice creams, please.

-Big enough to be seen.

08:30.919 --> 08:33.159
Big enough to order the ice cream.

-It's not fair!

Hm... hm?

08:55.439 --> 08:56.720

08:56.840 --> 08:59.000
It must've been me
and my monstrous body

08:59.120 --> 09:00.640
when I fell on my back.

09:00.760 --> 09:02.199
I'm so sorry, Tony.

09:02.319 --> 09:03.800
Oh... [sniffs]

I know you didn't... mean to.

[sobs]

09:07.880 --> 09:09.199
You were right, Moon.

09:09.400 --> 09:11.400
I don't want to change sizes anymore.

09:11.560 --> 09:14.000
I want to be me.
I want to be small again.

09:14.199 --> 09:16.520
If I were small,
then I could put the tiny parts

09:16.720 --> 09:18.360
of Tony's bike back together!

09:18.480 --> 09:21.240
Yes... and if I were big...

09:21.360 --> 09:25.160
then I could lift
these heavy metal pieces...

09:25.280 --> 09:26.240
Agh!

09:26.360 --> 09:29.520
But we can't.
'Cause I'm big and you're small.

-It is a bit.

-No, it's not!
-Kinda...

-Na-huh!
-Yeah... it is.

09:37.760 --> 09:39.319
Ha-ha, I'm with Moon.

09:39.439 --> 09:42.000
Big and small are both awesome!

10:25.640 --> 10:26.920
Just think of all the deliveries

10:27.040 --> 10:29.120
and all the rides you can give now, Tony!

10:29.240 --> 10:31.880
Ho-ho, thanks, giant friends!

10:32.520 --> 10:34.480
[ice cream truck tune]

10:34.600 --> 10:36.800
-Ha-ha, there it is!
-Ice cream truck!

10:36.920 --> 10:38.400
This time, we're ready!

10:38.640 --> 10:41.640
Anyone else want ice cream? No?

10:42.240 --> 10:44.319
-[Ollie] Afternoon!
-Huh?

10:44.760 --> 10:45.920
[Moon giggles]

10:46.040 --> 10:48.600
[all slurping]

10:48.800 --> 10:50.160
What do you think, Ollie?

10:50.280 --> 10:52.120
You OK with being small again?

10:52.240 --> 10:53.439
You bet, Moon!

10:53.560 --> 10:56.280
The smaller you are,
the bigger the ice cream!

10:56.400 --> 10:59.480
[all laugh]

11:00.079 --> 11:03.160
[lively music]
