WEBVTT

00:02.847 --> 00:04.517
Come on. Come on.

00:04.517 --> 00:06.857
Oh, my God!

00:11.627 --> 00:13.397
Ugh, it's negative again.

00:13.397 --> 00:15.957
Where did you get a pregnancy
test with sound effects?

00:15.967 --> 00:19.227
At Spencer's Gifts. It's also
where I get my condoms.

00:19.237 --> 00:20.900
What, wait, you're...
you're wearing condoms

00:20.907 --> 00:22.537
while we're trying
to get pregnant?

00:22.537 --> 00:25.437
They're joke condoms.
They have a big hole in the end.

00:25.437 --> 00:27.577
I just wear them for the feel...

00:27.577 --> 00:29.137
and the chuckles.

00:29.147 --> 00:32.647
You doof. I can't wait to have
your big, doofy baby.

00:32.647 --> 00:34.917
I wanna have a babe
with you, too, babe.

00:36.387 --> 00:38.047
Hey!
Are you done in there?

00:38.057 --> 00:39.617
Get out, get out, get out!

00:39.617 --> 00:42.187
I went to Taco King!
I can't do this in my bowl!

00:44.597 --> 00:47.597
♪ Good morning, U.S.A. ♪

00:47.597 --> 00:51.427

01:09.117 --> 01:12.217
♪ Good morning, U.S.A. ♪

01:14.757 --> 01:18.587
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
We know how much you want this.

01:18.597 --> 01:20.497
I don't know what's wrong.
I've been eating right,

01:20.497 --> 01:22.627
exercising,
taking all the vitamins.

01:22.627 --> 01:24.467
And I bought a butterfly net
to catch the baby

01:24.467 --> 01:26.197
when he comes shooting out.

01:26.197 --> 01:28.437
We've been trying all kinds
of different positions, too.

01:28.437 --> 01:30.367
The spider pretzel,
the butter churner,

01:30.367 --> 01:31.837
the standing wheelbarrow.

01:31.837 --> 01:34.137
And my favorite,
the breakfast for dinner.

01:34.137 --> 01:35.807
That's where I fry him an egg,

01:35.807 --> 01:38.347
and then we do it quite
traditionally, from behind.

01:38.347 --> 01:39.717
Well, you must be doing
something wrong.

01:39.717 --> 01:42.147
I got Francine pregnant
on the first try.

01:42.147 --> 01:43.787
Bang, bang, chicken and shrimp!

01:43.787 --> 01:45.387
What's going on?
I'm bored. I got nothin'.

01:45.387 --> 01:47.217
By the looks of your faces,
you got nothin', too.

01:47.217 --> 01:48.620
God, it's so boring
in this house. I'm bored.

01:48.627 --> 01:50.157
What's going on?

01:50.157 --> 01:52.957
Haley and Jeff are having
trouble getting pregnant.

01:52.957 --> 01:55.227
Oh, good. This isn't boring.
I could drop a bomb on this.

01:55.227 --> 01:57.197
See, Hayley's never going
to get pregnant

01:57.197 --> 01:59.567
because Jeff's an alien.
Boom!

01:59.567 --> 02:00.837
Wait, what?!

02:00.837 --> 02:02.537
Ever since Jeff got back
from space,

02:02.537 --> 02:04.037
he's had an alien body.

02:04.037 --> 02:06.407
Only human part left
is his brain.

02:06.407 --> 02:10.146
Ohh, that explains why my pee
is slightly brighter than usual.

02:10.146 --> 02:12.147
And why I haven't slept
in a year

02:12.147 --> 02:13.877
or even felt the need to.

02:13.877 --> 02:17.817
Yeah, that explains everything.
Did I leave anything out, Stan?

02:17.817 --> 02:19.857
You knew?!
Yes, but I couldn't tell anyone,

02:19.857 --> 02:21.857
because I'm
an amazing secret keeper.

02:21.857 --> 02:24.227
<i>Well, why didn't you tell me?
That is also a secret.</i>

02:24.227 --> 02:26.187
I know we weren't gonna
say anything, Stan,

02:26.197 --> 02:27.527
but I got bored.

02:27.527 --> 02:29.397
Remember at Disney World
how I got bored,

02:29.397 --> 02:30.997
so I tried to drown
that fat lady

02:30.997 --> 02:32.827
on Pirates of the Caribbean?

02:32.837 --> 02:35.497
You guys went to Disney World
without me?

02:35.507 --> 02:37.037
My boy Reggie is Pluto!

02:37.037 --> 02:39.207
He could've got you
pineapple Dole Whips

02:39.207 --> 02:41.337
half-price, fool!

02:41.478 --> 02:44.806
My other boy Dante's got
a sick condo in Daytona Beach.

02:45.037 --> 02:47.565
It's only a 90-minute drive
from Disney World.

02:47.837 --> 02:49.806
<i>And I got a hookup
for Lightning tickets.</i>

02:49.902 --> 02:52.893
Warm weather hockey...
you don't get that up here.

02:53.132 --> 02:53.781
Shut up, Klaus!

02:54.739 --> 02:56.227
I also have a boy
in Jacksonville.

02:56.932 --> 02:59.592
I can't believe this.
I'm married to an alien.

02:59.602 --> 03:02.162
I-I've been having sex
with an alien!

03:02.162 --> 03:03.665
I don't see what the big deal
is, Hayley.

03:03.672 --> 03:05.002
Lots of people sleep
with aliens...

03:05.002 --> 03:07.532
Lois Lane,
Marvin the Martian's wife,

03:07.542 --> 03:10.472
every cable guy who's ever
come to this house.

03:10.472 --> 03:12.942
But I don't feel like an alien.
I feel like me.

03:12.942 --> 03:15.612
That's because you still have
your stupid human brain.

03:15.612 --> 03:17.782
Hey, I love
your stupid human brain,

03:17.782 --> 03:20.282
and I don't even care
that you're an alien.

03:20.282 --> 03:21.782
Liberal.

03:21.782 --> 03:24.722
But... I do wish
we could have a baby.

03:24.722 --> 03:27.392
<i>Well, you could have a baby
if Jeff became human again,</i>

03:27.392 --> 03:28.992
but that's impossible.

03:28.992 --> 03:30.662
<i>Unless...</i>

03:30.662 --> 03:33.562
you gave his brain to a birthing
alien on its heat cycle

03:33.562 --> 03:35.732
so Jeff could be reborn
as a human.

03:35.732 --> 03:38.572
<i>But you'd need to find
a birthing alien here on Earth</i>

03:38.572 --> 03:40.702
other than me,
because I'm not doing it.

03:40.702 --> 03:42.572
Whew! Is it hot in here?
I can't tell.

03:42.572 --> 03:44.572
I'm on my heat cycle.
Anyway, impossible.

03:44.572 --> 03:47.042
Such a bummer.
Gotta go. Bored again.

03:47.042 --> 03:49.342
My boy in Jacksonville's
name is Leroy.

03:49.352 --> 03:51.082
He's a barback
at Buffalo Wild Wings,

03:51.082 --> 03:52.982
and he says if we go down there,

03:52.982 --> 03:57.582
<i>we might be able to party
with the waitstaff.</i>

03:59.762 --> 04:03.222
And then Marybeth Stephanie
called me a "Hufflepuff"!

04:03.232 --> 04:04.762
Can you believe that?!

04:04.762 --> 04:06.662
I've been called
some terrible things before,

04:06.662 --> 04:08.362
but never a Hufflepuff.

04:08.362 --> 04:11.032
That's stupid!
You're totally a Ravenclaw.

04:11.032 --> 04:14.502
I know! But even though
I was real peeved,

04:14.502 --> 04:19.072
I just said "thank you" because
I didn't want to offend her.

04:19.072 --> 04:21.411
You're a bit of a Hufflepuff.
Yeah, I'm a Hufflepuff.

04:21.411 --> 04:23.112
Are you Snot?
Are you poor?

04:23.112 --> 04:24.612
Uh...
Because we're...

04:24.612 --> 04:26.752
Trish!
And the Sizzle.

04:26.752 --> 04:29.552
And you're on
"Morning Mimosa's"...

04:29.552 --> 04:31.392
"Three Happy Days"!

04:32.892 --> 04:35.022
Whoa, awesome!

04:35.022 --> 04:36.722
What? What's happening?

04:36.732 --> 04:39.432
What's happening is you just
hit the jackpot, buddy.

04:39.432 --> 04:41.062
Every year on "Morning Mimosa,"

04:41.062 --> 04:44.432
they surprise a poor kid
with three happy days!

04:44.432 --> 04:46.372
You're poor, aren't you, Snots?

04:46.372 --> 04:48.272
Look at you!
Of course you are.

04:48.272 --> 04:51.242
Come with us! Your first
happy day starts now!

04:51.242 --> 04:53.072
Three happy days!

04:53.082 --> 04:54.812
Three happy days!

04:54.812 --> 04:57.712
<i>Being poor is so weird.</i>

04:57.712 --> 04:59.082
Like, when I think of tuna,

04:59.082 --> 05:00.882
I think of tuna
from a fancy sushi place,

05:00.882 --> 05:03.752
and you think of tuna
from a shitty can,

05:03.752 --> 05:06.122
like a cat.

05:07.562 --> 05:10.122
Poor people are a lot like cats.

05:12.632 --> 05:15.662
Please, Roger, I really wanna
be human again.

05:15.662 --> 05:17.832
And if that doesn't happen,
we'll never have a baby.

05:17.832 --> 05:19.932
What if someone told you
that you couldn't have

05:19.942 --> 05:21.342
<i>what you wanted most in life?</i>

05:21.342 --> 05:22.672
Jake Gyllenhaal?

05:22.672 --> 05:25.072
If somebody
told me I couldn't have him,

05:25.072 --> 05:27.072
I-I don't even know what I...

05:27.082 --> 05:29.112
Ah! That'd be awful!

05:29.112 --> 05:30.642
I'll be there for you
the whole time,

05:30.652 --> 05:32.852
every step of the way.
Well, I have always wanted

05:32.852 --> 05:35.152
them fat swangin'
pregnancy tits.

05:35.152 --> 05:37.622
You would look great with those!

05:37.622 --> 05:40.122
I'll do it.
I'll carry your Jeff baby.

05:40.122 --> 05:43.122
Muchas gracias!
Oh, Thank you!

05:43.132 --> 05:45.832
Now, how do we go about
getting Jeff's brain?

05:45.832 --> 05:47.532
Aah!

05:49.000 --> 05:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:58.472 --> 06:01.982
And now there's a 10% chance
that I'm pregnant.

06:01.982 --> 06:03.782
Three happy days!

06:03.782 --> 06:05.782
Three happy days!

06:05.782 --> 06:07.652
That's right. Every year,
the Sizzle and I

06:07.652 --> 06:11.222
help one poor kid
with the saddest story.

06:11.222 --> 06:12.852
This year, we were faced

06:12.862 --> 06:15.692
with the biggest challenge
we've ever had.

06:15.692 --> 06:18.392
Meet Snot Lonstein...
poor, yet Jewish.

06:18.392 --> 06:20.692
So for Snots' first happy day,

06:20.702 --> 06:23.232
we gave him
a much-needed makeover.

06:23.232 --> 06:26.472
Meet the brand-new Snots!

06:33.412 --> 06:36.382
Fabulous! Now let's bring out
the person

06:36.382 --> 06:38.982
responsible for you being
here today.

06:38.982 --> 06:42.682
Snot, meet your knight
in shining armor, Steve Smith!

06:44.152 --> 06:45.852
<i>You nominated me?</i>

06:45.852 --> 06:48.522
Yeah, I did.
I felt bad for you.

06:48.522 --> 06:50.825
You think it doesn't break my
heart when we go to the movies

06:50.832 --> 06:53.762
and you bring that old
jawbreaker in that sticky bag?

06:53.762 --> 06:57.432
Snot, don't you wanna
thank Steve for nominating you?

06:57.432 --> 06:59.032
Let's see you...

06:59.032 --> 07:03.202
Kiss his feet! Kiss his feet!

07:12.382 --> 07:14.082
Where'd you find
this doctor, anyway?

07:14.082 --> 07:15.852
We can't go to a regular doctor,

07:15.852 --> 07:17.452
so Klaus recommended this guy.

07:17.452 --> 07:19.892
Hello! I'm Dr. Kalgary.

07:19.892 --> 07:23.292
I see you are lesbians.
Congratulations.

07:23.292 --> 07:24.792
Yep.

07:24.792 --> 07:26.262
I believe you are
hoping for some good news.

07:26.262 --> 07:28.362
Just tell me I'm pregnant, Doc.

07:29.772 --> 07:31.632
Wait.
I hear a heartbeat.

07:31.632 --> 07:33.372
That is very uncommon
in my office.

07:33.372 --> 07:35.302
I'm pregnant?
Oh, thank God!

07:35.302 --> 07:37.072
Let's take a closer look.

07:38.612 --> 07:40.372
Thank you, Billy.

07:42.442 --> 07:45.252
And you are having...

07:45.252 --> 07:48.882
an adult man.

07:48.882 --> 07:50.752
Oh, my God! It's Jeff!

07:50.752 --> 07:52.952
I'm printing you a copy.

07:52.962 --> 07:54.692
Billy!

08:01.832 --> 08:03.832
Aah!

08:03.832 --> 08:05.172
It's okay.
I got it.

08:05.172 --> 08:08.032
No, no.
Let him get it himself.

08:12.812 --> 08:15.912
I'm getting stronger!

08:19.220 --> 08:21.950
Everything hurts.

08:21.950 --> 08:23.720
And the cravings...

08:23.720 --> 08:26.220
I want a cigarette
and five shots of Patrón.

08:25.559 --> 08:27.929
Roger, you can't smoke
or drink during your pregnancy.

08:27.929 --> 08:30.729
Okay, but can't I just cook

08:30.729 --> 08:32.129
the tiniest bit of meth?

08:32.139 --> 08:33.568
It won't hurt nobody.

08:33.568 --> 08:35.099
Here, have some pickles instead.

08:35.109 --> 08:38.409
Oh, God, the smell!
Get that away from me!

08:38.409 --> 08:41.078
But these are your favorite.

08:43.749 --> 08:45.149
I think I missed a spot.

08:47.619 --> 08:49.079
Ugh. This is disgusting.

08:49.089 --> 08:51.489
I'm disgusting,
and I hate this thing!

08:51.489 --> 08:53.959
You! You did this to me!

08:57.259 --> 08:59.229
I think if I had
just a tiny bit of meth,

08:59.229 --> 09:01.629
it'd settle my stomach.
No, Roger.

09:01.629 --> 09:04.629
<i>Just a widdle cwystal?</i>

09:04.639 --> 09:06.739
With the help
of his best friend, Steve,

09:06.739 --> 09:11.469
we're about to surprise Snots
with his second happy day.

09:11.479 --> 09:13.179
Let's go!

09:13.179 --> 09:15.479
Oh, my! Sizzle? Trish?!
Am I on...

09:15.479 --> 09:17.609
Shut up!
You're not part of this!

09:17.619 --> 09:19.949
Wake up, wake up, wake up!
Huh?

09:19.949 --> 09:22.279
We're sending you
and your best friend Steve

09:22.289 --> 09:23.649
to the water park!

09:23.649 --> 09:25.319
What do ya say, Snots?!

09:25.319 --> 09:29.359
I'll go, but not with Steve.
I'll just take my mom.

09:29.359 --> 09:33.829
Oh, my God! Snots is so poor,
he has to date his mom!

09:33.829 --> 09:35.299
<i>Why aren't you taking me?</i>

09:35.299 --> 09:36.869
I'm the reason you get
to go to the water park

09:36.869 --> 09:39.639
in the first place.
I don't wanna be pitied.

09:39.639 --> 09:42.769
I thought you would know that.
It's so humiliating.

09:42.769 --> 09:44.169
How is this humiliating?

09:44.179 --> 09:46.309
Oh, my God!

09:46.309 --> 09:50.779
Is his pillow just a t-shirt
stuffed with newspapers?

09:50.779 --> 09:52.879
Dennis, get a shot of that.

09:57.659 --> 09:59.719
Roger, I got everything
you asked for...

09:59.719 --> 10:02.019
a turkey sandwich,
that pillow you like,

10:02.029 --> 10:03.829
and binoculars so you can
watch the gardener

10:03.829 --> 10:05.189
work across the street.

10:05.199 --> 10:07.559
Hmm. Ahh. Ahh.

10:07.569 --> 10:09.159
That feels nice.

10:09.169 --> 10:12.729
<i>And this here tastes amaze.</i>

10:12.739 --> 10:15.539
Ooh, I'd let that guy
spread his seed on me.

10:15.539 --> 10:18.869
If he pulled my weed, I'd show
him some "miracle grow."

10:18.879 --> 10:22.409
Is that a Venus flytrap? Because
my next pun depends on it.

10:22.409 --> 10:25.749
It's anus guy flap.

10:25.749 --> 10:29.649
So if you're good, I'm gonna go
see a movie with Klaus.

10:29.649 --> 10:32.019
Oh. Is Klaus carrying
your baby?

10:32.019 --> 10:33.359
Well, no.

10:33.359 --> 10:35.389
Oh, so the movie's
carrying your baby.

10:35.389 --> 10:36.929
You're welcome to come with us.

10:36.929 --> 10:39.529
Klaus didn't invite me.
Klaus thinks you hate him.

10:39.529 --> 10:41.529
I do hate him.
I'd kill him if I could!

10:41.529 --> 10:43.429
Roger, you're... you're
very emotional

10:43.429 --> 10:44.829
because you're pregnant.

10:44.839 --> 10:47.069
You said you'd be there
every step of the way!

10:47.069 --> 10:50.169
God, I'm so upset, I can't even
finish this sandwich!

10:52.539 --> 10:54.609
<i>You're starving me and the baby!</i>

10:54.609 --> 10:57.049
I'm sorry!
I'll do whatever you want!

10:57.049 --> 11:00.049
<i>I want you to want to be here,</i>

11:00.049 --> 11:02.379
and I want you to make me
exactly the same sandwich

11:02.389 --> 11:05.849
you did before because you
straight up killed it.

11:05.859 --> 11:08.919
Is it just me,
or has Roger gone crazy?

11:08.929 --> 11:12.029
Hayley, how how many times
have you been pregnant? None.

11:12.029 --> 11:15.129
How many times have
I been pregnant? Four.

11:17.569 --> 11:20.599
Point is, I know
what Roger's going through.

11:20.599 --> 11:23.109
All he wants is
to feel appreciated.

11:23.109 --> 11:24.769
I'm trying the best I can.

11:24.779 --> 11:29.109
Try harder. He's carrying
your husband, after all.

11:29.109 --> 11:30.609
Damn it, Hayley!
I'm starving!

11:30.609 --> 11:32.049
Are you gonna make me
suck the milk

11:32.049 --> 11:34.119
out of my own damn boobs?!

11:34.119 --> 11:37.649
Huh.

11:37.659 --> 11:40.159
Bring me some Oreos!

11:40.159 --> 11:41.919
Morning, Mimosa-nators.

11:41.929 --> 11:45.789
We're about to surprise Snots
with his third happy day.

11:45.799 --> 11:47.729
Blow the door!

11:47.729 --> 11:49.629
You're back!

11:49.629 --> 11:51.599
Uhh!

11:51.599 --> 11:53.499
♪ Wake up, wake up, wake up ♪

11:53.499 --> 11:57.409
It's time for your third hap...
Where the hell is he?

11:57.409 --> 11:59.509
I'm sorry, Snot.
I screwed up,

11:59.509 --> 12:01.409
but I'm gonna get you
out of this, I promise.

12:03.009 --> 12:05.409
He's here! Aah!

12:05.419 --> 12:07.749
Run!

12:09.119 --> 12:11.319
Sues, we're not
trying to kill him.

12:11.319 --> 12:13.259
We're just trying to give him
his third happy day.

12:13.259 --> 12:15.119
Sorry.

12:15.129 --> 12:16.829
I was just flashing back
to Desert Storm.

12:16.829 --> 12:19.459
<i>Okay, but you weren't
in Desert Storm.</i>

12:19.459 --> 12:21.799
<i>You saw part of
Three Kings on HBO.</i>

12:21.799 --> 12:25.499
The part I saw was so powerful.

12:28.009 --> 12:30.039
It's not time for my nap yet.

12:30.039 --> 12:31.809
Why are you bringing me
upstairs?

12:31.809 --> 12:35.439
On "Goop," Gwyneth Paltrow says
I should avoid stairs.

12:35.449 --> 12:37.209
"Goop" says I shouldn't
exert myself.

12:37.209 --> 12:39.609
"Goop" says my ankles are weak.

12:39.619 --> 12:41.219
We should buy an elevator
like "Goop" says.

12:41.219 --> 12:43.119
Surprise!

12:43.119 --> 12:46.189
Oh, my God!
A surprise baby shower?!

12:46.189 --> 12:47.719
You've been through
a lot, Roger,

12:47.729 --> 12:49.659
and I wanted to do
something nice for you.

12:49.659 --> 12:53.459
Well, as tough as it's been,
I must say I've been a rock.

12:53.459 --> 12:55.399
Ooh! Presents!

12:56.669 --> 12:59.129
Happy baby shower, Roger!

13:00.339 --> 13:01.999
A Phish CD?

13:02.009 --> 13:05.209
It's Jeff's favorite band!
That's so sweet, Mom.

13:05.209 --> 13:06.879
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

13:06.879 --> 13:08.879
The baby is not gonna listen
to this stoner garbage.

13:08.879 --> 13:12.179
He's above that. For him,
it's only classical masters,

13:12.179 --> 13:14.019
<i>like the Indiana Jones
soundtrack.</i>

13:15.689 --> 13:18.949
Whatever. Dad, why don't you
give Roger your present?

13:22.829 --> 13:24.929
It's Jeff's hat.
I got it out of the closet.

13:24.929 --> 13:26.429
I forgot we were doing this.

13:26.429 --> 13:28.529
Yuck! The baby won't be
wearing hats,

13:28.529 --> 13:30.669
not when he has access
to my wigs.

13:30.669 --> 13:32.429
Roger, that's Jeff's
favorite hat.

13:32.439 --> 13:33.869
He wears it all the time.

13:33.869 --> 13:35.499
Not anymore, he won't.

13:35.509 --> 13:37.169
Are there more presents?
Tell me there are more presents.

13:37.169 --> 13:39.039
Well, I didn't know if it was
going to be a boy or a girl,

13:39.039 --> 13:40.579
so I got you this.

13:41.449 --> 13:44.509
Oh, yes!
A sparkly sequined onesie!

13:44.519 --> 13:46.379
This is perfect for the baby!

13:46.379 --> 13:48.449
It's all I've ever wanted
for him,

13:48.449 --> 13:50.949
to be sawed in half
at a magic show.

13:50.949 --> 13:52.589
Thank you, Klaus.

13:52.589 --> 13:54.619
You're the only one
who knows what my baby wants.

13:54.629 --> 13:56.389
Get over yourself, Roger!

13:56.389 --> 13:59.289
<i>It's not your baby!
It's my Jeff!</i>

13:59.299 --> 14:01.029
<i>Oh, it's your Jeff, is it?</i>

14:01.029 --> 14:04.099
<i>Well, what your Jeff needs
is his mother... me.</i>

14:04.099 --> 14:06.129
You know what he doesn't need?
You!

14:06.139 --> 14:09.039
And come to think of it,
I don't need you either.

14:09.039 --> 14:11.539
<i>Where the hell are you going?
I'm outta here, bitch.</i>

14:11.539 --> 14:13.779
I'm raising this baby on my own.

14:13.779 --> 14:16.909
And you know what?
His name's not Jeff anymore.

14:16.909 --> 14:19.109
It's Tristan!

14:19.119 --> 14:21.219
I figured it out!

14:21.219 --> 14:22.979
This diaper has Snickers in it.

14:22.989 --> 14:24.419
Dad, we weren't playing
that game.

14:24.419 --> 14:26.219
Where'd you find that?

14:28.657 --> 14:30.487
Guys, Roger's out there,
God knows where,

14:30.487 --> 14:32.657
walking around with Jeff
inside him.

14:32.657 --> 14:34.697
<i>Or should I say Tristan?</i>

14:34.697 --> 14:37.897
Hayley, relax.
Tristan's a great name.

14:37.897 --> 14:40.367
We should've named Steve
Tristan.

14:40.367 --> 14:42.697
Pregnant mothers
just get emotional.

14:42.707 --> 14:45.337
And they stay emotional!
Up top.

14:45.337 --> 14:47.707
Don't look at me, Stan.
I love women.

14:47.707 --> 14:49.707
I respect them too much.

14:49.707 --> 14:51.077
Please.

14:51.077 --> 14:53.147
Is it too late
to side with you, Stan?

14:53.147 --> 14:54.577
Let's go find Roger.

14:54.577 --> 14:56.677

No, no, I will not.

16:08.957 --> 16:11.127
Go around, Mike!

16:16.627 --> 16:18.097
Aw, crud.

16:21.667 --> 16:22.897
Looking for this?

16:22.907 --> 16:24.637
Oh, no!
How did you find me?

16:24.637 --> 16:27.237
This is where I ran off to
when I was pregnant.

16:27.237 --> 16:29.937
It's the... "Go-to motel for
scared pregnant women."

16:29.947 --> 16:31.477
I read your Yelp review.

16:31.477 --> 16:33.147
Why'd you run away?

16:33.147 --> 16:36.617
To think about the most
important decision of my life...

16:36.617 --> 16:38.987
whether or not I was
going to keep you.

16:38.987 --> 16:41.187
Oh, hey!
Is that the coin I flipped?

16:41.187 --> 16:42.817
Roger, I'm sorry.

16:42.827 --> 16:45.857
This whole time, I was
so focused on getting Jeff back,

16:45.857 --> 16:48.257
I forgot how much
this was affecting you.

16:48.257 --> 16:50.857
So... I got you this.

16:52.437 --> 16:55.097
Now you can match Jeff...

16:55.097 --> 16:57.707
or Tristan,
whatever you wanna call him.

16:57.707 --> 17:00.007
We are in this together.

17:00.007 --> 17:01.777
Let's call him Jeff!

17:01.777 --> 17:05.047
I'm starting to think
"Tristan" is a gay lion's name.

17:05.047 --> 17:06.477
Ready to come home?

17:06.477 --> 17:09.317
Okay, just let me grab my...
Aah!

17:09.317 --> 17:11.217
Aah! Roger!
Your eyes are bleeding!

17:11.217 --> 17:12.646
The baby!

17:12.656 --> 17:14.047
What? What's wrong
with the baby?!

17:14.057 --> 17:16.557
Bleeding eyes
means the baby's coming!

17:16.557 --> 17:18.387
I thought you read
the book I got you!

17:18.387 --> 17:21.497
I did! But it was just
David Blaine's life story.

17:21.497 --> 17:23.857
Oh, yeah, well, I was right
to give you that book.

17:23.867 --> 17:25.327
It's awesome. Pretty cool.

17:25.327 --> 17:27.396
He was bullied as a kid
and then made himself

17:27.396 --> 17:30.137
into one of the most popular
magicians in the world.

17:30.137 --> 17:32.667
Speaking of magicians,
did you know Criss Angel

17:32.677 --> 17:35.237
lives on the top floor
of the Luxor?

17:35.237 --> 17:37.137
Do you think he has a book?
I-I don't know.

17:37.147 --> 17:40.577
Shut up, you babbling bitch!
I'm having a baby here!

18:14.847 --> 18:18.217
No one escapes
the third happy day!

18:23.227 --> 18:25.587
Childbirth really hurts!

18:25.587 --> 18:28.457
I have so much respect
for Michelle Duggar now,

18:28.457 --> 18:31.227
which is saying something,
because I already considered her

18:31.227 --> 18:34.097
one of the most accomplished
women of her generation.

18:34.097 --> 18:36.067
Aah!

18:36.067 --> 18:37.867
Stay strong, Roger.
Keep pushing.

18:37.867 --> 18:40.807
This is punishment for all
the bad things I've done,

18:40.807 --> 18:42.877
like the time I took
those blind people

18:42.877 --> 18:44.747
to that noisy warehouse
and told them

18:44.747 --> 18:46.377
they were at the World Series.

18:46.377 --> 18:49.947
I sold them $12 beers
I bought for $8,

18:49.947 --> 18:52.447
and when they were super drunk,
I made their team lose

18:52.457 --> 18:53.947
in the bottom of the 9th

18:53.957 --> 18:56.217
and broke their dumb,
blind hearts.

18:56.227 --> 18:57.487
Keep pushing!

18:59.227 --> 19:00.657
He's here!

19:02.897 --> 19:06.067
Congratulations!
It's a strange thing.

19:06.067 --> 19:08.467
Why's he so small? I thought
he was coming out full grown.

19:08.467 --> 19:09.897
What's wrong?

19:09.907 --> 19:11.667
Oh, it's like one
of those sponge dinosaurs.

19:11.667 --> 19:13.637
He'll get bigger
once we add water.

19:13.637 --> 19:16.237
Can I... Can I see him?

19:16.247 --> 19:19.947
Hey, buddy.

19:19.947 --> 19:21.247
Roger!

19:22.487 --> 19:25.517
My mouth is super juicy
for this very purpose.

19:25.517 --> 19:27.187
Babe.
Jeff, it's you!

19:27.187 --> 19:28.787
Aw, give him here.

19:28.787 --> 19:32.487
I need to do skin-to-skin
contact right away.

19:32.497 --> 19:35.757
He's not latching.
I disown this child.

19:41.337 --> 19:44.097
I'm sorry these three happy days
have been so terrible.

19:44.107 --> 19:46.637
Actually, today's been
pretty good.

19:46.637 --> 19:49.107
What? You twisted
your ankle,

19:49.107 --> 19:50.807
we almost died
in a freezing river,

19:50.807 --> 19:52.347
and now we're hiding
in a storm drain

19:52.347 --> 19:54.047
that smells like a dead body.

19:54.047 --> 19:57.677
Yeah, but I wasn't poor,
and you weren't middle class.

19:57.687 --> 20:01.957
We were just two best friends,
running for our lives.

20:01.957 --> 20:04.157
Come here.

20:04.157 --> 20:05.657
Whoa.

20:05.657 --> 20:09.057
I feel it, too.
This is a hell of a moment.

20:09.057 --> 20:13.067
No, it's just... I know why it
smells like a dead body in here.

20:13.067 --> 20:14.397
I'm not dead.

20:14.397 --> 20:16.367
Just because I don't conform

20:16.367 --> 20:19.837
to your conventional standard
of beauty doesn't mean I'm dead.

20:19.837 --> 20:24.077
You know all those magazine
covers are Photoshopped, right?

20:24.077 --> 20:25.707
Aah!

20:25.707 --> 20:30.817
<i>Scared of what
a real woman looks like?!</i>

20:33.357 --> 20:35.187
So, after everything with Roger,

20:35.187 --> 20:38.157
I realized, there's so much more
to having kids

20:38.157 --> 20:39.657
than I ever thought,

20:39.657 --> 20:41.557
and I don't know if
they're ready for that.

20:41.557 --> 20:43.397
Well, having just been born,

20:43.397 --> 20:46.197
I feel I'm a little young
to have a baby.

20:46.197 --> 20:47.727
Guys, I finally added up
the bill

20:47.737 --> 20:49.097
for being your surrogate.

20:49.097 --> 20:51.767
Food, parts, labor,
loss of other income,

20:51.767 --> 20:55.437
