(heavy breathing)

00:09.377 --> 00:12.546
(loud thudding)

00:12.546 --> 00:14.082
- [Man] Fuck!

00:14.082 --> 00:15.483
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

00:18.186 --> 00:20.854

00:40.808 --> 00:43.144
I can't get a fucking break!

00:44.345 --> 00:46.980
Nothing fucking
works out for me!

00:46.980 --> 00:47.815
Goddammit!

00:49.950 --> 00:52.453
Fuck myself, fuck, fuck, fuck!

00:54.388 --> 00:56.957
(wind blowing)

01:01.162 --> 01:03.497
Oh you fucking little bitch.

01:13.407 --> 01:16.410
(breathing heavily)

01:23.251 --> 01:26.754
(deep, suspenseful music)

02:29.016 --> 02:31.852
(leaves rustling)

02:41.962 --> 02:45.466
(slow, eerie piano music)

03:08.889 --> 03:10.224
- [Man] Rebecca!

03:14.528 --> 03:15.363
Rebecca.

03:16.297 --> 03:18.299
Get out, it's late, now!

03:21.101 --> 03:24.104
(eerie piano music)

04:07.981 --> 04:11.485
(mellow electronic music)

05:22.356 --> 05:23.357
- That's it?

05:25.158 --> 05:26.494
Girl, seriously?

05:27.661 --> 05:30.230
- Uh, I tried for
like 40 minutes.

05:30.230 --> 05:32.400
Plus, last night
was like forever.

05:32.400 --> 05:35.736
- Okay, I guess you're
just not really into it.

05:35.736 --> 05:37.337
- Like you are?

05:37.337 --> 05:41.108
Probably still
thinking about Nae-Nae.

05:41.108 --> 05:44.978
You two should just make
up already, and quick.

05:44.978 --> 05:49.149
- (sighing) No,
besides, screw her.

05:50.384 --> 05:52.886
- Christ, you so love that ho.

05:55.623 --> 05:58.626
Why don't you just talk
to her for god sakes?

05:58.626 --> 06:00.728
(sighing)

06:03.397 --> 06:06.500
- Come on, get back down there.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.435
- Ah, fuck.

06:23.451 --> 06:26.353
- So again, the
definition of feminism

06:26.353 --> 06:28.756
is the advocacy
of women's rights

06:28.756 --> 06:31.692
on the basis of the
equality of the sexes,

06:31.692 --> 06:34.762
that's it, nothing more or less.

06:34.762 --> 06:39.232
This idea has always been
conflated with other ideas.

06:39.232 --> 06:42.069
But, as a sociologist,
it's about being clear

06:42.069 --> 06:45.072
on what this term means
and what it stands for.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.908
In closing, I do have a
quote for you all to chew on.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.644
A feminist is anyone who
recognizes the equality

06:50.644 --> 06:53.647
and full humanity
of women and men.

06:53.647 --> 06:56.650
That's a quote by
Gloria Steinem, okay?

06:56.650 --> 07:01.354
Uh, let me see, remember,
next week's our final so,

07:01.354 --> 07:02.189
ready up.

07:09.162 --> 07:10.964
- I know I turned in my
assignment late last week but

07:10.964 --> 07:12.633
can I still get full
credit for that?

07:12.633 --> 07:14.502
- Uh, most likely it's
gonna be a C, Emily.

07:14.502 --> 07:15.435
- Okay.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.737
- Okay, great, you're welcome.

07:16.737 --> 07:18.238
- Hey.

07:18.238 --> 07:19.473
- Hey, so how's it looking
with the surveys, Rene?

07:19.473 --> 07:21.274
- It's coming along
pretty well, you know.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.844
Just um, most of
'em are filled out,

07:23.844 --> 07:25.879
I just have a few
more to hand out.

07:25.879 --> 07:28.315
- Excellent, excellent,
thanks for all your help,

07:28.315 --> 07:29.783
and I should have those
letters of recommendation

07:29.783 --> 07:31.218
for you ready next week.

07:31.218 --> 07:33.186
- Uh, that would be
amazing, you know I just,

07:33.186 --> 07:36.356
(sighing) I'm so nervous
with this whole thing I've,

07:36.356 --> 07:37.991
as far back as I can
remember all I wanted

07:37.991 --> 07:39.893
was to have my PhD.

07:39.893 --> 07:41.228
- Rene, you'll be fine.

07:41.228 --> 07:43.531
You are made for grad
school, trust me.

07:43.531 --> 07:45.398
After eight years of
it, I know it, okay.

07:45.398 --> 07:46.466
You're gonna be
a great academic.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.335
- Thank you, you know I just,

07:48.335 --> 07:49.703
you have no idea how
much this means to me

07:49.703 --> 07:53.006
and you've helped
me a lot so I just,

07:53.006 --> 07:54.908
thank you so much, you--

07:54.908 --> 07:57.210
- Brian, what can I do for you?

07:57.210 --> 07:58.712
It's okay, okay.

07:58.712 --> 07:59.980
- [Brian] Can I just
get the assignment

07:59.980 --> 08:01.148
that I turned in to
you, I'm sorry, I--

08:01.148 --> 08:02.215
- Let me check my
computer and then I'll,

08:02.215 --> 08:03.450
I'll get back to you on that.

08:03.450 --> 08:06.854
(funky electronic music)

08:20.167 --> 08:24.171
(music increasing in intensity)

09:08.348 --> 09:09.917
- Shut up, shut up.

09:11.151 --> 09:13.253
You're fine, you're fine.

09:15.656 --> 09:19.026
He's happy, he's
happy, and you're fine.

09:19.026 --> 09:20.894
You're gonna have a good day,

09:20.894 --> 09:24.031
you're gonna go over there,
you're gonna have a good day.

09:24.031 --> 09:26.333
You're gonna go out,
you're gonna have fun,

09:26.333 --> 09:29.670
you're gonna see him,
and he'll be fine.

09:31.204 --> 09:33.440
(laughing)

09:34.775 --> 09:38.211
(funky electronic music)

09:41.048 --> 09:43.717
(sighing) Okay.

09:44.985 --> 09:48.421
(funky electronic music)

09:55.395 --> 09:59.566
(people chattering
in background)

10:08.709 --> 10:12.212
(tense single drum music)

11:12.572 --> 11:16.744
(eerie, supernatural music)
(labored breathing)

11:27.254 --> 11:29.356
- Um, hey, where's the remote?

11:29.356 --> 11:33.526
I always keep it in
the (growling) fuck!

11:34.494 --> 11:37.164
(growling)

11:37.164 --> 11:41.634
(labored breathing) It's
ridiculous, that girl.

11:41.634 --> 11:44.571
Oh, fuck, I have
that consultation,

11:46.173 --> 11:48.175
shit, shit, shit, shit.

11:48.175 --> 11:50.510
Okay, okay, okay, all right.

11:52.145 --> 11:52.980
Okay.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.048
Okay.

12:04.691 --> 12:07.660

12:07.660 --> 12:10.730

(clearing throat) Um, uh-huh.

12:14.201 --> 12:16.603
No, no, I'm calling
about the consultation.

12:16.603 --> 12:19.206
Yes, yeah, I have your paperwork

12:19.206 --> 12:20.607
and I'm gonna send
it right to you

12:20.607 --> 12:22.675

12:23.844 --> 12:27.547
Um-hm, yeah, okay, so

12:28.748 --> 12:30.750
Um-hm, oh yeah, okay.

12:30.750 --> 12:34.221
Oh, yeah, yes,
absolutely, okay, you too,

12:34.221 --> 12:35.722
oh, bye-bye, okay.

12:38.325 --> 12:40.493
(sighing)

12:42.362 --> 12:45.698
(dramatic, scary tones)

12:49.069 --> 12:53.240
(drawer sliding
and clicking shut)

12:56.509 --> 12:58.445
(sighing)

12:58.445 --> 13:01.648
(gurgling and ticking)

13:14.895 --> 13:15.728
Really?

13:16.864 --> 13:19.967
You can't even buy
groceries, thank you.

13:21.534 --> 13:24.304
(eerie growling)

13:27.340 --> 13:30.110
(deep breathing)

13:42.990 --> 13:46.759
(wind blowing eerily)

13:46.759 --> 13:49.262
(dog barking)

13:56.369 --> 13:58.271
(sighing)

13:58.271 --> 14:02.375
(dog barking)
(eerie pulsating tones)

14:05.545 --> 14:06.613
Okay so, Pam,

14:08.916 --> 14:10.417

14:11.651 --> 14:15.956

14:15.956 --> 14:19.692
It's a, it's a, the
house is well done, good.

14:21.661 --> 14:25.532
In a, in a, in a well
good way, in a-ish.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.700
Oh, no, no, no,

14:27.700 --> 14:30.770

14:35.575 --> 14:36.409
Um--

14:39.346 --> 14:40.380
(dog barking)

14:40.380 --> 14:42.049
Emoji, emoji, hello.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.484
(dog barking)

14:44.484 --> 14:46.086
Fuck, Emoji, quiet.

14:51.258 --> 14:54.194
(breathing deeply)

14:55.595 --> 14:58.765
(wind blowing eerily)

15:07.140 --> 15:09.876
(haunting tones)

15:20.720 --> 15:21.621
Oh, my god.

15:22.722 --> 15:26.126
(scary, pulsating tones)

15:38.838 --> 15:41.441
(wind howling)

15:48.248 --> 15:51.184
(breathing deeply)

15:52.719 --> 15:56.656
(sharp, scary pulsating tones)

16:07.334 --> 16:08.935
(swishing)
(groaning)

16:08.935 --> 16:10.637
(slicing)

16:10.637 --> 16:12.639
(thudding)

16:12.639 --> 16:15.642
(deep, scary tones)

16:18.545 --> 16:21.214
- [Brittany] Dude, you
are set for grad school.

16:21.214 --> 16:23.583
You're like the perfect
student on every level.

16:23.583 --> 16:24.851
- [Rene] I know
dude, but you know,

16:24.851 --> 16:27.654
grad school a whole
nother level, it's--

16:27.654 --> 16:31.391
- [Brittany] So was high
school, so was undergrad.

16:31.391 --> 16:33.026
- [Rene] I mean I
guess you're right.

16:33.026 --> 16:34.294
- [Brittany] Yeah, I know.

16:34.294 --> 16:36.196
- [Rene] Hey, are you
playing in that game?

16:36.196 --> 16:38.265
- [Brittany] I don't know,
Patty was super pissy

16:38.265 --> 16:40.967
at practice yesterday so,

16:40.967 --> 16:43.936
I'm really just trying not
to think about it this week.

16:43.936 --> 16:45.872
- [Rene] Hey so listen, now
that you bring the, that,

16:45.872 --> 16:50.043
the weekend, is there anyway
I could use an excuse?

16:51.678 --> 16:53.313
- [Brittany] No.

16:53.313 --> 16:56.049
- Brittany I have a lot
of stuff going on and,

16:56.049 --> 16:57.784
you know, it's just--

16:57.784 --> 16:59.386
- Uh, we, you've
already committed

16:59.386 --> 17:01.588
that we're doing
this for Meagan.

17:01.588 --> 17:03.290
You're gonna have to suck it up.

17:03.290 --> 17:05.425
- You know, to be
honest, I don't think

17:05.425 --> 17:09.096
I'm friends with them
anymore, there's--

17:09.096 --> 17:12.132
- [Brittany] What happened
between you and Kem?

17:12.132 --> 17:15.734
- There's nothing, I'm just,
look, I'm just different now,

17:15.734 --> 17:19.005
okay, I'm not into that
base crap that they are and,

17:19.005 --> 17:20.240
she's so shallow.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.473
- [Brittany] What,
so I'm shallow?

17:21.473 --> 17:22.974
- [Rene] No, I'm
not, you're just--

17:22.974 --> 17:26.846
- Bullshit, I'm friends with
them still and you used to be.

17:26.846 --> 17:29.048
Look, this is not about
us, it's about Meagan.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.550
She's been through
some shit lately.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.652
We need to be there for
her, we're her sisters.

17:32.652 --> 17:34.087
- [Rene] Yeah.

17:34.087 --> 17:36.523
- I mean we've been friends
for such a long time,

17:36.523 --> 17:40.059
I mean, we can do
one more weekend.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.262
Can you handle that?

17:42.262 --> 17:45.932
- Yeah, I can do one
more weekend, that's,

17:45.932 --> 17:47.300
it's whatever, here.

17:47.300 --> 17:48.801
- [Brittany] Okay.

17:53.039 --> 17:54.641
- [Rene] Oh that's pretty good.

17:54.641 --> 17:58.645
(funky, tense electronic music)

18:21.701 --> 18:23.736
- [Kem] At that point you
have to just not talk.

18:23.736 --> 18:26.973
- I know, and I'm like he's
the one who's arguing with me.

18:26.973 --> 18:29.276
- Remember Barry, the guy
I dated sophomore year?

18:29.276 --> 18:30.477
He was like that,

18:30.477 --> 18:32.044
he would fight me on
anything and everything.

18:32.044 --> 18:33.580
- Yeah, but that guy was an ass.

18:33.580 --> 18:36.316
Kyle's sweet, he just feels a
moronic need to argue with me.

18:36.316 --> 18:38.351
- Again, boys, they
are only trouble.

18:38.351 --> 18:39.719
And we must
constantly remind them

18:39.719 --> 18:41.588
that they are the inferior sex.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.790
- Please, spare us
that feminism soapbox

18:43.790 --> 18:45.492
you're about to stand on.

18:45.492 --> 18:48.328
You're such a les,
have you had good dick?

18:48.328 --> 18:49.429
You can't preach to the
choir if you haven't

18:49.429 --> 18:50.863
sang in one--
- Twelve years, too hot.

18:50.863 --> 18:53.566
- Can you just chill, everyone's
entitled to their opinion.

18:53.566 --> 18:56.836
- Truthfully, no, I have not
sung in that particular choir,

18:56.836 --> 19:00.207
but you know, I also have
priorities, doll face.

19:00.207 --> 19:03.343
- Priorities my ass, but
whatever, I'll prove you wrong.

19:03.343 --> 19:05.578
I'm gonna drop the kids
at the pool, girlies.

19:05.578 --> 19:06.813
- [Meagan] Ugh.

19:08.014 --> 19:11.184
- On that note girlies,
I think it's time for us

19:11.184 --> 19:13.119
to get drunk and wet.

19:13.119 --> 19:14.621
(laughing)

19:14.621 --> 19:16.289
- Brittany, I didn't know
it was that kind of a party.

19:16.289 --> 19:20.660
- Dude, damn Rene, I like
you when you're feisty, girl.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.929
But, no ideas dear,

19:22.929 --> 19:24.831
even though we are in
the experimental stages

19:24.831 --> 19:26.799
of our sex lives.

19:26.799 --> 19:28.601
- Cool, I'm gonna put
on my new swimsuit.

19:28.601 --> 19:32.272
Don't get jealous if Rene
starts hitting on me, Meagan.

19:32.272 --> 19:34.974
- Kelly I'm gay, not stupid.

19:34.974 --> 19:37.244
Hey, do you think I
should just go home?

19:37.244 --> 19:38.511
I mean, Kem is just--

19:38.511 --> 19:41.047
- No, no, she's just
harmless, you know.

19:41.047 --> 19:42.915
The others are cool, I
mean they'll miss you.

19:42.915 --> 19:44.417
- She's just so annoying,

19:44.417 --> 19:45.252
you know?
- I know.

19:45.252 --> 19:47.887
- She rhymes with punt.

19:47.887 --> 19:50.490
- I know but we've all agreed
that we're gonna hang out

19:50.490 --> 19:53.025
one last time
before school ends.

19:53.025 --> 19:56.429
Plus, apparently every
group needs a punt.

19:56.429 --> 19:57.930
- (laughing) You're good.

19:57.930 --> 20:01.100
- I know, look, you just
might have some fun.

20:01.100 --> 20:04.203
A couple of shots, a
couple cannon balls.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.672
- Okay.
- Yeah.

20:05.672 --> 20:07.407
Go throw on somethin' that
shows off them curves.

20:07.407 --> 20:09.709
- Oh, you know that's
not happening, right?

20:09.709 --> 20:12.379
- Well, I'm about to,
so drool appropriately

20:12.379 --> 20:13.813
once you see this
ultra-sexy body.

20:13.813 --> 20:16.483
- Uh-huh, okay, go get it, girl.

20:38.605 --> 20:40.507
(tense tones)

20:40.507 --> 20:42.342
- Holy shit, what
the hell did you eat?

20:42.342 --> 20:43.676
- Shit, seriously?

20:43.676 --> 20:44.977
- [Kelly] You ate shit?

20:44.977 --> 20:47.347
- Come on Kel, there's
such thing as privacy.

20:47.347 --> 20:51.150
- Not right now, did you see
that bitch's post with Darren?

20:51.150 --> 20:52.051
- Oh, ouch!

20:53.453 --> 20:54.754
- That crazy skank.

20:54.754 --> 20:57.256
- Look, I love you, but
it's been about a year,

20:57.256 --> 20:58.925
he ain't coming back.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.159
- [Kelly] I just can't
handle seeing him

21:00.159 --> 21:03.730
with that crazy bitch. (sighing)

21:03.730 --> 21:06.232
- [Kem] Hm, what would Kem do?

21:09.869 --> 21:12.472
- What a tantalizing idea.

21:12.472 --> 21:13.940
I knew you were
good for something

21:13.940 --> 21:16.576
other than taking
horrendous dumps.

21:16.576 --> 21:20.179
- Look, text him this,
can't wait to see you again.

21:20.179 --> 21:21.781
You know she's a
crazy psycho bitch,

21:21.781 --> 21:26.052
when she sees it on his
phone, she'll fuckin' flip.

21:26.052 --> 21:30.189
- You brilliant, conniving
bitch, I so love you.

21:30.189 --> 21:33.593
- Oh god, yeah, yeah,
can you please get out?

21:33.593 --> 21:34.794
This is totally sick.

21:34.794 --> 21:37.497
Man, what the fuck did I eat?

21:37.497 --> 21:38.331
God.

21:40.700 --> 21:42.635
Close the fuckin' door!

21:49.742 --> 21:53.012
(slow, haunting music)

23:01.347 --> 23:02.749
- [Boy On Video Game] Run, run!

23:02.749 --> 23:06.419
(guns firing on video game)

23:08.387 --> 23:09.889
- [Woman On Video Game]
I'm calling in for support.

23:09.889 --> 23:12.692
(guns firing rapidly
on video game)

23:12.692 --> 23:14.326
(woman on video
muffled by gun fire)

23:14.326 --> 23:15.261
- [Man On Video Game]
Here, calm down.

23:15.261 --> 23:17.464
Take a breath, count 'em.

23:17.464 --> 23:19.198
(guns firing rapidly)

23:19.198 --> 23:20.600
(man on video game
muffled by gunfire)

23:20.600 --> 23:21.434
Fuck!

23:46.726 --> 23:48.961
(exhaling)

23:50.262 --> 23:51.097
(guns firing rapidly
on video game)

23:51.097 --> 23:52.499
- Howdy.

23:52.499 --> 23:55.568
(door clicking shut)

23:56.435 --> 23:57.269
Hey.

23:57.269 --> 23:58.104
- Hey.

23:58.104 --> 23:59.105
- I missed you.

23:59.105 --> 24:00.339
- I missed you.

24:02.041 --> 24:03.442
- What are you playing?

24:03.442 --> 24:06.312
- Dead Time, and
I was killing it.

24:06.312 --> 24:09.015
- [Nelly] Okay,
how was your day?

24:09.015 --> 24:11.350
- [Darren] It was all right.

24:15.522 --> 24:18.357
(guns firing rapidly
on video game)

24:18.357 --> 24:19.926
- You want me to
leave you alone?

24:19.926 --> 24:22.595
- [Darren] No, no, just
give me like five minutes.

24:22.595 --> 24:24.063
- All right.

24:24.063 --> 24:25.464
- [Woman On Video Game] Have
you had contact with survivors?

24:25.464 --> 24:28.801
- [Man On Video Game] Negative,
there's been no contact.

24:30.336 --> 24:32.371
(people yelling and
screaming on video game)

24:32.371 --> 24:34.206
- [Woman On Video Game]
I'm calling in for support.

24:34.206 --> 24:37.043
(guns firing on video game)
(people talking on video game)

24:37.043 --> 24:38.745
- I'm serious, give
me like five minutes.

24:38.745 --> 24:41.147
- I'm, I'm playin' Dead Time.

24:41.147 --> 24:45.317
(guns firing rapidly
on video game)

24:58.598 --> 25:01.634
(people screaming on video game)

25:01.634 --> 25:04.804
All right, I'm gonna
go take a shower.

25:09.776 --> 25:11.510
Feel free to join me.

25:24.991 --> 25:28.327
(shower water spraying)

25:37.737 --> 25:40.472
(humming)

25:40.472 --> 25:42.274
- [Kelly] Caught you, bitch.

25:42.274 --> 25:43.976
- Oh lord, what now?

25:43.976 --> 25:46.145
- Take that, bitch.

25:46.145 --> 25:48.214
- [Meagan] Hey D,
last night was amazing

25:48.214 --> 25:50.717
we should do it again soon.

25:50.717 --> 25:52.251
- [Brittany] What the hell?

25:52.251 --> 25:54.987
- Kel, you really need
to just let him go.

25:54.987 --> 25:58.024
- Hell no, that
bitch needs to hurt

25:58.024 --> 25:59.959
and he needs to suffer my wrath.

25:59.959 --> 26:01.160
And do it for me on both counts.

26:01.160 --> 26:03.963
- Brilliant Kel, I'm
gonna keep drinking but

26:03.963 --> 26:05.598
you can strategize
on how to fuck up

26:05.598 --> 26:07.934
people's lives on social media.

26:07.934 --> 26:10.770
- Whatever, I'm
gonna go get high.

26:12.605 --> 26:15.107
- Wait Kem, are you okay?

26:15.107 --> 26:17.109
- [Kem] Don't I look great?

26:17.109 --> 26:18.577
- [Brittany] You know what?

26:18.577 --> 26:20.246
- What are you doin' Brit,
you wanna play mommy?

26:20.246 --> 26:21.814
Give me my lecture.

26:23.015 --> 26:24.951
- I just hope that you
and Rene can be okay.

26:24.951 --> 26:26.485
You know we've been
through so much together,

26:26.485 --> 26:27.787
we've been friends for so long

26:27.787 --> 26:30.790
and this might be the
last time we hang out.

26:30.790 --> 26:34.126
- Okay fine, I'll play nice
with the little lesbian.

26:34.126 --> 26:35.027
Is that it?

26:36.428 --> 26:38.798
- Just be cool, okay?

26:38.798 --> 26:41.267
- You know what, it's not okay.

26:41.267 --> 26:42.969
I don't like her, period.

26:42.969 --> 26:44.170
I don't care that she's lesbian,

26:44.170 --> 26:46.372
but that whole holier
than thou crap,

26:46.372 --> 26:48.808
just because she's
going to grad school.

26:48.808 --> 26:51.811
Truth is, she really does think
she's better than all of us.

26:51.811 --> 26:54.714
And trust me honey, she's not.

26:54.714 --> 26:57.316
Grad school doesn't mean shit.

26:57.316 --> 26:59.018
I just don't like her, Brit.

26:59.018 --> 27:00.853
She's a stuck up bitch.

27:17.403 --> 27:19.706
(dog barking)

27:19.706 --> 27:22.474
(coughing)

27:22.474 --> 27:26.645
(groaning and gasping)
(dog barking)

28:15.661 --> 28:18.397
(haunting tones)

28:21.901 --> 28:26.005
(Hector groaning and struggling)

29:07.279 --> 29:09.715
- You have the best parents.

29:09.715 --> 29:12.151
- [Darren] I guess so.

29:12.151 --> 29:16.322
- You don't have to deal
with my dad, disgusting pig.

29:22.561 --> 29:23.495
I hate him.

29:25.865 --> 29:26.866
- It's okay.

29:28.567 --> 29:29.969
Soon we'll move out of here

29:29.969 --> 29:33.039
and we won't have
to worry about him.

29:34.206 --> 29:36.708
- I'm just glad he can
never hurt me again.

29:36.708 --> 29:40.813
- He can't, and if
he did, I'd end him.

29:40.813 --> 29:42.048
- You'll never leave, right?

29:42.048 --> 29:43.515
- Never.

29:43.515 --> 29:44.383
- I love you.

29:44.383 --> 29:45.818
- I love you too.

29:51.657 --> 29:53.492
- You hungry, I'll
make you something.

29:53.492 --> 29:57.296
- Yes, uh your french
toast, they are the best.

29:57.296 --> 29:58.130
- Got it.

30:11.743 --> 30:14.914
Okay, second thought,
how bout we go out to eat

30:14.914 --> 30:17.549
because you don't
have any bread.

30:17.549 --> 30:19.218
- Yeah, why don't we do that.

30:19.218 --> 30:20.052
- Do you wanna
make a date of it?

30:20.052 --> 30:21.687
We'll go see a movie.

30:21.687 --> 30:23.122
- Yeah, let's go.

30:25.824 --> 30:28.127
- Do you wanna
check movie times?

30:28.127 --> 30:28.961
- Yeah.

30:33.632 --> 30:35.267
You know, better yet, why
don't we just go out to eat--

30:35.267 --> 30:36.268
- [Nelly] What was that?

30:36.268 --> 30:37.736
- What was what?

30:37.736 --> 30:40.372
- I saw Kelly's
name, what was that?

30:40.372 --> 30:42.774
- It was nothing, honestly.

30:42.774 --> 30:44.276
- Then show me.

30:44.276 --> 30:45.577
- No, you don't need to see
it, it's not a big deal.

30:45.577 --> 30:47.413
- [Nelly] If it's not a
big deal, then show me.

30:47.413 --> 30:48.414
- Let's just go to the,
let's go out to eat,

30:48.414 --> 30:49.715
it's not a big--

30:49.715 --> 30:50.416
- Let me see.
- You're gonna make a big deal

30:50.416 --> 30:51.650
out of nothin'.

30:54.620 --> 30:55.487
I don't know what
she's talkin' about.

30:55.487 --> 30:56.455
- You slept with her.

30:56.455 --> 30:57.289
- I didn't sleep with her.

30:57.289 --> 30:58.257
- You slept with her.

30:58.257 --> 30:59.225
- I didn't sleep with her, no.

30:59.225 --> 31:00.392
- Then why did she say this?

31:00.392 --> 31:01.860
- [Darren] I don't
know why she said that.

31:01.860 --> 31:02.895
- So she's lying?

31:02.895 --> 31:03.862
- [Darren] Yeah, she's lying.

31:03.862 --> 31:05.397
- Really?

31:05.397 --> 31:08.434
- She's ly, I have no idea
what she's talking about.

31:08.434 --> 31:09.768
She's crazy now, I don't know
what she's talking about.

31:09.768 --> 31:11.570
- Wow, okay, so she's crazy.

31:11.570 --> 31:12.504
I'm crazy--
- She's crazy.

31:12.504 --> 31:13.739
- We're all just fucking crazy.

31:13.739 --> 31:14.673
Really, really.
- I'm telling you,

31:14.673 --> 31:15.607
I don't know why she sent this.

31:15.607 --> 31:18.010
- Really, what do you mean?

31:18.010 --> 31:19.345
- I don't know--
- What, she's just lying?

31:19.345 --> 31:20.179
- [Darren] She's lying,
I'm telling you--

31:20.179 --> 31:21.480
- Why would she

31:21.480 --> 31:22.681
say that though?
- Just calm down okay, she's--

31:22.681 --> 31:24.416
- [Nelly] Don't tell
me to calm down.

31:24.416 --> 31:25.584
- She's lying.

31:25.584 --> 31:26.418
You gotta believe me.
- No, she's not,

31:26.418 --> 31:27.853
you slept with her.

31:27.853 --> 31:32.058
You slept with that
fucking whore, Darren!

31:32.058 --> 31:34.060
- I didn't sleep with
her Nel, I don't know--

31:34.060 --> 31:35.594
- No, you slept with her.

31:35.594 --> 31:38.864
That fucking whore,
you slept with her!

31:40.499 --> 31:42.334
- Nel, just calm down.

31:43.435 --> 31:44.870
I didn't sleep with her, Nel.

31:44.870 --> 31:45.737
- [Nelly] Yes, you did.

31:45.737 --> 31:47.073
- Look, just calm down.

31:47.073 --> 31:48.040
- [Nelly] Then why would you say

31:48.040 --> 31:48.874
that you slept with her then?

31:48.874 --> 31:50.109
- I don't know.

31:51.310 --> 31:52.711
(sighing)

31:52.711 --> 31:53.980
I don't know what's goin' on.
- I just got my dad

31:53.980 --> 31:55.881
out of my life and now
you're doing this to me.

31:55.881 --> 31:57.116
- [Darren] I didn't do anything.

31:57.116 --> 31:59.418
- You slept with
that fucking whore,

31:59.418 --> 32:02.989
that's what you did,
that's what you did!

32:02.989 --> 32:06.692
- [Darren] Nel, you
gotta calm down.

32:06.692 --> 32:07.960
- I can't believe
you did this to me.

32:07.960 --> 32:10.963
No, I'm, I'm done,
I'm fucking done.

32:12.298 --> 32:14.967
(door slamming)

32:16.568 --> 32:18.137
(sighing)

32:18.137 --> 32:19.138
- Goddammit.

32:24.576 --> 32:26.678
Nel, Nel please, come on.

32:28.014 --> 32:29.615
Nelly.
(car engine starting)

32:29.615 --> 32:30.449
Nelly.

32:31.517 --> 32:34.253
Nelly, come on. (sighing)

32:34.253 --> 32:37.656
(funky electronic music)

32:39.091 --> 32:40.292
Nelly.

32:40.292 --> 32:43.695
(funky electronic music)

32:46.698 --> 32:47.533
Goddammit.

32:49.735 --> 32:52.204
(exhaling)

32:52.204 --> 32:56.208
(tense, funky electronic music)

32:57.309 --> 33:00.212
- [Girl] Okay ready, here we go.

33:00.212 --> 33:01.247
- [Girls] Go.

33:02.548 --> 33:04.416
(girls laughing)

33:04.416 --> 33:06.252
- [Girl] Looks a little hot.

33:06.252 --> 33:07.953
- [Girl] But!

33:07.953 --> 33:10.256
- [Girl] Ooh, nice.

33:10.256 --> 33:14.426
(water splashing)
(ball thudding)

33:16.162 --> 33:18.930
(girls laughing)

33:33.612 --> 33:36.182
(girl muffled)

33:40.786 --> 33:41.987
- Kem, go get it.

33:41.987 --> 33:43.455
- [Kem] No, you go get it.

33:43.455 --> 33:45.057
- No, you go get it.

33:45.057 --> 33:47.193
- [Brittany] Come on,
you guys are such dicks.

33:47.193 --> 33:48.660
- I'll just go get it.

33:48.660 --> 33:50.529
- [Kem] Exactly, do
what you're told.

33:50.529 --> 33:51.430
- Fuck you.

33:53.365 --> 33:55.601
(laughing)

33:56.602 --> 33:59.771
(low, haunting music)

34:12.284 --> 34:15.687
(scary, pulsating music)

34:26.831 --> 34:27.833
(dramatic tone)

34:27.833 --> 34:29.067
- Fuck!

34:29.067 --> 34:31.103
- Jesus, scaredy
cat, it's just me.

34:31.103 --> 34:33.438
- Well don't just sneak
up on people, you know.

34:33.438 --> 34:34.973
It's just fucking rude.

34:34.973 --> 34:37.208
- Listen, don't
back down to them.

34:37.208 --> 34:39.344
- I didn't, I flipped 'em off.

34:39.344 --> 34:41.380
- I know but, you
know what I mean.

34:41.380 --> 34:43.849
I think if you stand up for
yourself, they'll back off.

34:43.849 --> 34:45.851
- Look, honestly Brit, I'm just,

34:45.851 --> 34:47.652
I'm just trying to get
through today, okay.

34:47.652 --> 34:48.820
I know it's important to you,

34:48.820 --> 34:51.556
and you're important to me, so,

34:51.556 --> 34:53.458
I guess the less waves
at the pool party--

34:53.458 --> 34:55.427
- I know, and I
appreciate it, but,

34:55.427 --> 34:58.497
just don't let them
push you around, okay.

34:58.497 --> 35:00.566
I know what a tough
bitch you can be.

35:00.566 --> 35:01.767
You didn't get into grad
school without all the

35:01.767 --> 35:02.968
blood, sweat, and tears.
- Come on let's go,

35:02.968 --> 35:04.170
stop freaking out.

35:04.170 --> 35:05.671
We're in the middle
of a game here,

35:05.671 --> 35:07.806
and I'm sure we don't have
to remind you that the--

35:07.806 --> 35:08.740
- Huh.

35:08.740 --> 35:09.841
- Don't pay attention to her.

35:09.841 --> 35:12.311
- Vodka, you forgot the vodka.

35:12.311 --> 35:13.712
- Okay, let's go.

35:16.047 --> 35:16.882
- Dammit.

35:21.086 --> 35:23.755
Nel, pick up the
goddamn phone, Nel.

35:23.755 --> 35:26.625
(sighing)

35:26.625 --> 35:27.459
Goddammit.

35:31.997 --> 35:34.333
Nel, pick up the phone, Nel.

35:42.007 --> 35:44.042
Nel, please pick up the phone.

35:44.042 --> 35:46.345
I don't know what's goin' on.

35:46.345 --> 35:49.915
(mysterious, bouncy music)

36:06.198 --> 36:07.132
- [Meagan] You think
it was true right,

36:07.132 --> 36:08.700
that she was killed here?

36:08.700 --> 36:11.270
- [Kelly] Seriously,
you're freaking me out.

36:11.270 --> 36:12.871
I'm not sleeping here tonight.

36:12.871 --> 36:14.373
- I don't believe
the whole story.

36:14.373 --> 36:16.942
I mean why would a girl
kill herself in this pool?

36:16.942 --> 36:18.677
I think she was
probably murdered.

36:18.677 --> 36:19.878
- When my parents moved in,

36:19.878 --> 36:22.214
they were told about
the whole story.

36:22.214 --> 36:25.851
- [Kelly] Again, can we please
talk about something else.

36:25.851 --> 36:28.254
- Okay baby, have you heard

36:28.254 --> 36:30.422
anything more from your boy?

36:30.422 --> 36:32.458
- [Meagan] Yeah, how'd your
brilliant plan work out?

36:32.458 --> 36:35.427
- I'm telling you, that nut
job's gonna stalk you now.

36:35.427 --> 36:36.895
- [Kelly] Let her,
I'll call the cops.

36:36.895 --> 36:38.297
Send that crazy bitch to jail.

36:38.297 --> 36:40.499
- Why don't you just
go and kick her ass?

36:40.499 --> 36:41.767
- [Kelly] I should.

36:41.767 --> 36:43.269
- Another great plan.

36:43.269 --> 36:45.737
- [Brittany] Or maybe just
let it go, and move on.

36:45.737 --> 36:48.073
- Or be celibate, like Rene.

36:50.942 --> 36:52.678
Oh look, she's alive.

36:52.678 --> 36:54.713
- [Brittany] Kem, chill.

36:54.713 --> 36:56.047
- Oh, I'm sorry.

36:57.483 --> 37:00.151
- Or how bout these girls
get stupid slushy drunk

37:00.151 --> 37:03.589
and get date raped by
the cutest frat boy.

37:05.857 --> 37:07.192
- What the fuck?

37:08.093 --> 37:09.828
What's your problem, Rene?

37:09.828 --> 37:10.662
- No, stop.

37:10.662 --> 37:12.163
- Meagan.

37:12.163 --> 37:13.098
- [Brittany] Okay, she was
just joking, let it go.

37:13.098 --> 37:15.434
- Joking, no fuck that.

37:15.434 --> 37:18.069
You can all make fun of
me and throw lesbian jokes

37:18.069 --> 37:21.473
and as soon as I say something,
everybody's butt hurt.

37:21.473 --> 37:23.742
- Just fuckin' around, huh?

37:24.943 --> 37:27.178
Well little girl,
if you wanna play,

37:27.178 --> 37:30.115
you best be prepared
for what comes next.

37:30.115 --> 37:32.784
- [Rene] Wow, okay,
and what would that be?

37:32.784 --> 37:36.121
- Here's the deal, you
stupid pussy eating whore.

37:36.121 --> 37:38.424
Try me again, and
I'll kick your ass

37:38.424 --> 37:41.360
until no one wants
you, understand?

37:42.761 --> 37:45.597
- Yes Kem, you know you've
made it crystal clear.

37:45.597 --> 37:47.599
And thank you for the
vivid explanation.

37:47.599 --> 37:49.868
- [Brittany] Look, you guys
both just need to chill, okay.

37:49.868 --> 37:51.803
- Yes, exactly, drinks?

37:53.204 --> 37:54.606
- [Kelly] Drinks.

38:03.715 --> 38:05.717
- Renee, you need to apologize.

38:05.717 --> 38:06.552
- What?

38:06.552 --> 38:07.486
- Do it now.

38:07.486 --> 38:08.320
- Huh.

38:11.122 --> 38:11.957
- [Kelly] Thank you.

38:11.957 --> 38:13.359
- It's good shit.

38:14.593 --> 38:15.427
Here girl.

38:16.495 --> 38:18.163
- Look Kem, I'm sorry okay,

38:18.163 --> 38:20.198
that was a very
shitty thing to say.

38:20.198 --> 38:23.735
I shouldn't have
made light of it.

38:23.735 --> 38:26.772
- Whatever, let's just
get fucking wasted.

38:26.772 --> 38:28.039
- Um-hm.

38:28.039 --> 38:31.977
- What kind of girly ass
drink bullshit is this?

38:33.144 --> 38:36.515
- Damn, I didn't mean
back down that much.

38:36.515 --> 38:39.184
- Look Brittany, I'm
just over it, okay?

38:39.184 --> 38:41.553
Fucking tired, she's
gonna have her opinions,

38:41.553 --> 38:42.888
and I have mine.

38:46.758 --> 38:47.859
- Good, good.

38:51.430 --> 38:54.933
(bouncy electronic music)

39:47.218 --> 39:48.119
- Mr. Ryan.

39:54.259 --> 39:55.093
Nelly.

39:56.695 --> 39:58.864
(sighing)

40:03.168 --> 40:04.002
Mr. Ryan.

40:09.575 --> 40:13.745
(sighing) Fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck.

40:23.989 --> 40:24.823
Nelly.

40:35.166 --> 40:38.203
(wind howling)

40:38.203 --> 40:41.439
(groaning and panting)

40:55.854 --> 40:58.023
(gasping)

41:45.503 --> 41:48.073
(upbeat music)

42:29.380 --> 42:30.882
(girls laughing)

42:30.882 --> 42:33.885
- I left my change at home
ladies, y'all take singles?

42:33.885 --> 42:37.889
- Get off your ass and join
us, you know you want to.

42:37.889 --> 42:40.458
(upbeat music)

42:46.665 --> 42:47.498
- Come on.

42:50.068 --> 42:50.902
Whoo!

42:53.004 --> 42:54.539
Whoo!

42:54.539 --> 42:57.008
- Oh shit, Kem, I gotta
go do it, come follow me?

42:57.008 --> 42:58.343
- [Kem] No, I'm not your mama.

42:58.343 --> 43:00.679
- [Meagan] Yeah,
what are you, five?

43:00.679 --> 43:02.748
- Whatever, bitches.

43:02.748 --> 43:05.316
(upbeat music)

43:38.483 --> 43:39.317
Poor baby.

43:55.133 --> 43:57.703
(upbeat music)

44:00.672 --> 44:03.141
(scary tones)

44:04.375 --> 44:08.546
(Kelly talking
quietly and crying)

44:31.236 --> 44:32.070
Great.

44:53.992 --> 44:56.828
No plunger in this
huge-ass house.

44:59.765 --> 45:02.700
(deep, scary tones)

45:20.886 --> 45:23.154
Where's the stupid plunger?

45:26.124 --> 45:29.027
Whatever, have shit
in your toilet.

45:33.664 --> 45:34.732
Ew, I'm dead.

45:38.036 --> 45:39.805
Split ends, whatever.

45:41.773 --> 45:44.542
Bathing suit,
style like Beyonce.

45:47.712 --> 45:49.848
Whatever, I'm
gonna go get drunk.

45:49.848 --> 45:52.350
(scary tones)

46:00.691 --> 46:02.627
No, stop, stop!

46:02.627 --> 46:06.031
(scary, pulsating tones)

46:13.538 --> 46:15.773
(groaning)

46:34.625 --> 46:37.228
(upbeat music)

46:38.196 --> 46:41.199
(deep, scary tones)

47:00.018 --> 47:03.288
(deep, pulsating tones)

47:16.067 --> 47:20.238
- (sighing) Come
on babe, come on.

47:47.632 --> 47:51.136
(bouncy electronic music)

48:29.774 --> 48:33.444
(sighing) Goddammit, Nelly.

48:35.213 --> 48:37.015
Where the fuck are you?

48:37.015 --> 48:40.518
(bouncy electronic music)

48:53.598 --> 48:56.601
Nelly baby, where are you?

48:56.601 --> 48:58.603
I've been lookin'
everywhere for you.

48:58.603 --> 49:00.705
I can't find ya.

49:00.705 --> 49:02.507
This is getting way
overboard, you got,

49:02.507 --> 49:05.576
you gotta call me

49:06.944 --> 49:07.845
I love you.

49:14.019 --> 49:16.054
(sighing)

49:16.054 --> 49:19.557
(bouncy electronic music)

50:05.603 --> 50:08.706
(cell phone ringing)

50:19.884 --> 50:21.319
- Hey, what's up?

50:22.753 --> 50:23.988
Yeah, I have 'em.

50:23.988 --> 50:25.823
Could I give 'em
to you tomorrow?

50:25.823 --> 50:29.260
With the girls, and
I'm feelin' a little,

50:30.561 --> 50:32.197
okay.

50:32.197 --> 50:34.365
Yeah, yeah I can meet you.

50:35.200 --> 50:36.033
Okay, bye.

50:37.968 --> 50:41.972
(sighing) So annoying, I
have Matt's freaking keys.

50:41.972 --> 50:44.309
- What, what, where?

50:44.309 --> 50:46.111
- [Brittany] In my stupid car.

50:46.111 --> 50:47.878
- [Meagan] Tell him to
pick 'em up here then.

50:47.878 --> 50:50.648
- No, I have to meet
him with them 'cause

50:50.648 --> 50:52.517
you know he has to
get ready for work,

50:52.517 --> 50:54.285
he'll be late, blah, blah, blah.

50:54.285 --> 50:55.553
I'll be back.
- Hey let me go with you then.

50:55.553 --> 50:59.090
Um, you've, you've had
a lot to drink anyways.

50:59.090 --> 51:01.692
- Oh I'll be fine,
you stay here.

51:01.692 --> 51:04.629
I'll be back quickly,
lickity split.

51:04.629 --> 51:06.131
- [Kem] You are super drunk.

51:06.131 --> 51:08.199
- I'm fine girls, really.

51:09.667 --> 51:12.537
- [Meagan] You are going to
have a quickie, I can tell.

51:12.537 --> 51:15.440
- Uh, no, Matt
doesn't do quickies.

51:17.442 --> 51:18.676
See ya.

51:18.676 --> 51:19.910
- [Kem] See ya.

51:20.878 --> 51:21.712
- Really?

51:49.974 --> 51:53.144
- Kel, I'm leaving,
I'll be back soon.

51:59.717 --> 52:01.752
- That girl is so whipped.

52:01.752 --> 52:03.454
Seriously, he can't just call in

52:03.454 --> 52:05.956
and say he's going to be late?

52:08.993 --> 52:11.396
Hey, where the hell is Kelly?

52:13.198 --> 52:16.701
You think she passed
out on the toilet again?

52:16.701 --> 52:18.536
- She's probably masturbating
to pictures of Darren

52:18.536 --> 52:20.571
with your vibrator.

52:20.571 --> 52:24.141
- Gross, she better
not be in my room then.

52:26.911 --> 52:30.248
(scary, haunting music)

53:03.414 --> 53:04.249

53:33.210 --> 53:35.313

(water spraying)

53:35.313 --> 53:36.146

53:44.689 --> 53:46.924

I need to take
whiny boy his keys.

53:54.799 --> 53:55.633

54:03.708 --> 54:04.542
Kel?

54:05.943 --> 54:07.077

54:07.077 --> 54:07.912
Shit.

54:09.213 --> 54:11.649
Hey, I know, I'm on my way.

54:11.649 --> 54:12.917
Chill out, chill out.

54:14.552 --> 54:16.454
I know, I'm sorry babe.

54:18.356 --> 54:19.189
I'm sorry.

54:39.677 --> 54:40.745

54:40.745 --> 54:43.848

56:25.282 --> 56:26.116
- Ah!

56:27.485 --> 56:30.755

57:05.355 --> 57:06.791

please, please, please,

58:06.083 --> 58:07.585
pick up the phone.

58:09.119 --> 58:11.188
Where the hell are you?

58:11.188 --> 58:13.624
I've been lookin' everywhere.

58:15.092 --> 58:17.327
Call me back, call me back.

58:34.478 --> 58:36.981
(sirens blaring)

58:36.981 --> 58:38.082
- [Meagan] Did you hear that?

58:38.082 --> 58:39.483
- Hm?

58:39.483 --> 58:41.786
Ah it's just probably
some old man fell.

58:41.786 --> 58:45.790
- Oh, hey prude, you want
some, it's great shit.

58:49.026 --> 58:50.294
- Course you don't,

58:50.294 --> 58:52.663
smoking just doesn't
go with grad school.

58:52.663 --> 58:54.531
- [Meagan] Relax, mamacita.

58:54.531 --> 58:57.267
(sirens blaring)

59:05.910 --> 59:07.578
- Bye, pretty prude.

59:09.513 --> 59:12.950
Feel free to leave, no
one's gonna stop you.

59:12.950 --> 59:16.053
- Yeah, you can
go away any time.

59:16.053 --> 59:17.822
- Why girls, why
would I do that?

59:17.822 --> 59:19.489
I am an invited guest.

59:19.489 --> 59:20.758
It would so rude of me to leave

59:20.758 --> 59:22.760
when Brittany isn't even back.

59:22.760 --> 59:24.261
Why don't you two
keep playing suck face

59:24.261 --> 59:26.263
with that little bong, huh?

59:26.263 --> 59:29.700
Oh and girls, please,
don't drown in the pool.

59:29.700 --> 59:31.936
(laughing)

59:31.936 --> 59:34.705
- Wow, that was cleaver.

59:34.705 --> 59:38.709
But remember, bitch Brit
ain't here to help you.

59:40.144 --> 59:43.714
- Huh, and what makes you
think I need her help, Kem?

59:43.714 --> 59:46.516
You're shit-faced, and
you're high as fuck.

59:46.516 --> 59:48.452
And baby come on, we both
know that's the easiest way

59:48.452 --> 59:50.454
to get you on your back.

59:51.722 --> 59:53.958
(laughing)

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:05.269
(Rene sighing)

01:00:08.906 --> 01:00:11.408
(tense tones)

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:19.717
(piano key jingling)

01:00:22.552 --> 01:00:25.089
(banging)

01:00:25.089 --> 01:00:28.158
(tense, scary tones)

01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:40.470
(piano music)

01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:14.872
(dramatic banging)

01:01:14.872 --> 01:01:19.109
- (laughing) Holy shit, you
should've seen your face.

01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:20.778
You must've shit yourself.

01:01:20.778 --> 01:01:22.012
- Okay, what's up?

01:01:22.012 --> 01:01:24.014
- [Meagan] Nothing
man, just your face.

01:01:24.014 --> 01:01:25.682
- Jesus Christ.

01:01:25.682 --> 01:01:29.253
- Girl, girl, you need
to relax, seriously.

01:01:30.587 --> 01:01:33.958
Look, it is true,
we don't like you.

01:01:33.958 --> 01:01:38.128
But maybe, just maybe, if you
chill the fuck out for once,

01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:42.532
and remove that stick
that's so far up your ass,

01:01:42.532 --> 01:01:44.301
we could all come
to an agreement.

01:01:44.301 --> 01:01:47.104
Lighten up, Rene, it's a party.

01:01:47.104 --> 01:01:49.039
Now come out to the pool
and take a couple hits,

01:01:49.039 --> 01:01:50.307
come on girl.
- I'm okay.

01:01:50.307 --> 01:01:51.141
- [Meagan] You need it.

01:01:51.141 --> 01:01:52.676
- I'm okay.

01:01:52.676 --> 01:01:55.980
- You need it, you need
it badly, man. (laughing)

01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:58.783
(banging)

01:01:58.783 --> 01:01:59.616
Hm, Kelly?

01:02:02.319 --> 01:02:04.088
Bitch, where are you?

01:02:07.124 --> 01:02:11.261
Stop playing with
yourself already, you ho.

01:02:11.261 --> 01:02:12.763
Get your ass down here,

01:02:12.763 --> 01:02:17.034
we're smokin' that kick
ass shit I got. (laughing)

01:02:17.034 --> 01:02:17.868
Kel.

01:02:19.103 --> 01:02:23.273
Kelly (laughing) where
the fuck are you?

01:02:25.142 --> 01:02:25.976
Kel.

01:02:28.078 --> 01:02:30.347
(thudding)

01:02:34.551 --> 01:02:38.722
And Meagan does not stick
the landing. (laughing)

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:46.931
I'm not sure what
the deal is Kel but

01:02:46.931 --> 01:02:50.234
I'm not playing hide
and go seek though.

01:02:50.234 --> 01:02:53.237
Oh shit. (laughing)

01:02:57.441 --> 01:02:59.276
- What's so funny?

01:02:59.276 --> 01:03:01.311
- I just remembered
your face, boo!

01:03:01.311 --> 01:03:03.881
(gasping and laughing)

01:03:03.881 --> 01:03:04.714
Classic.

01:03:06.550 --> 01:03:09.119
Chill out, Rene, come
on out to the pool,

01:03:09.119 --> 01:03:12.789
let's get stoned, you
need to get stoned, ho.

01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:14.691
Come on, prudy, it's
not gonna kill you

01:03:14.691 --> 01:03:16.226
to take a fuckin' break.

01:03:16.226 --> 01:03:17.461
- You know, you're
probably right.

01:03:17.461 --> 01:03:19.029
- [Meagan] Come on.

01:03:21.498 --> 01:03:25.002
(bouncy electronic music)

01:04:07.277 --> 01:04:08.112
- Nel.

01:04:09.646 --> 01:04:10.480
Monica.

01:04:11.381 --> 01:04:14.484
(tense, scary tones)

01:04:16.353 --> 01:04:17.187
Nelly!

01:04:18.555 --> 01:04:21.625
(tense, scary tones)

01:05:30.594 --> 01:05:34.764
(scary tones increasing
in intensity)

01:05:44.374 --> 01:05:47.211
- Darren, what are
you doing here?

01:05:48.178 --> 01:05:49.646
- Have you seen Nelly?

01:05:49.646 --> 01:05:51.081
- [Monica] Not today, why?

01:05:51.081 --> 01:05:52.016
- Oh, fuck.

01:05:52.916 --> 01:05:55.152
- [Monica] Hey, everything okay?

01:05:55.152 --> 01:05:55.986
- Yeah.

01:05:57.821 --> 01:06:00.957
- You gonna tell
me what's goin' on?

01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:02.026
Are you okay?

01:06:03.427 --> 01:06:05.029
- Yeah, it's just we,
we got into a fight

01:06:05.029 --> 01:06:07.664
and she's really upset.

01:06:07.664 --> 01:06:10.134
I just wanna make
sure she's okay.

01:06:10.134 --> 01:06:12.102
- [Monica] Okay.

01:06:12.102 --> 01:06:13.337
Hey, Darren, I haven't seen her

01:06:13.337 --> 01:06:16.706
since she got out
of the hospital.

01:06:16.706 --> 01:06:18.442
- [Darren] Hospital?

01:06:18.442 --> 01:06:21.178
- Yeah, where she
went after her,

01:06:22.312 --> 01:06:23.980
oh, you didn't know.

01:06:26.216 --> 01:06:27.751
- [Darren] What happened?

01:06:27.751 --> 01:06:29.886
- [Monica] Shit, I'm sorry, I
thought she would've told you.

01:06:29.886 --> 01:06:31.421
- Tell me what?

01:06:31.421 --> 01:06:33.190
- [Monica] Well I thought
for sure that she would--

01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:34.958
- [Darren] Tell me what?

01:06:34.958 --> 01:06:37.994
- Darren, come on, come inside.

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:39.396
- Monica, I can't, I need to--

01:06:39.396 --> 01:06:41.398
- [Monica] You need a drink.

01:06:41.398 --> 01:06:42.232
- Fuck.

01:06:54.778 --> 01:06:58.948
- So a few months ago, Nelly
decides to take her own life.

01:07:00.684 --> 01:07:02.386
She attacks her father.

01:07:02.386 --> 01:07:04.421
That part I didn't
mind so much but,

01:07:04.421 --> 01:07:07.023
then she took a bunch of pills.

01:07:09.859 --> 01:07:14.030
Oh, she's better since that
time, she's getting help.

01:07:15.332 --> 01:07:19.203
She spent a freakin'
month in the hospital.

01:07:19.203 --> 01:07:20.770
Don't you remember?

01:07:22.005 --> 01:07:24.341
- I mean, she told me
she was out with family.

01:07:24.341 --> 01:07:27.077
- Yeah, sounds like Nelly.

01:07:27.077 --> 01:07:31.248
That's probably just what
she told you, that's Nelly.

01:07:32.649 --> 01:07:36.086
Have you uh, have you
checked down by the river?

01:07:36.086 --> 01:07:37.654
- No, not yet.

01:07:37.654 --> 01:07:41.825
- [Monica] She's been goin'
there lately for peace whatever.

01:07:43.793 --> 01:07:46.596
- [Darren] Well then
let me check it out.

01:07:46.596 --> 01:07:48.132
- All right.

01:07:48.132 --> 01:07:49.399
- [Darren] Call me if you
hear anything from Nelly.

01:07:49.399 --> 01:07:51.701
- I will, hey you
do the same, okay?

01:07:53.603 --> 01:07:54.504
Hey Darren.

01:07:56.373 --> 01:07:57.207
- Yeah?

01:07:59.709 --> 01:08:02.146
- I'm glad you care about her.

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:07.584
She sure as shit needs
it, no one else does.

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:11.755
- Yeah.

01:08:12.889 --> 01:08:15.992
(tense, scary tones)

01:08:49.725 --> 01:08:52.796
(cell phone buzzing)

01:08:54.231 --> 01:08:55.999
- Detective Martinez.

01:08:57.966 --> 01:09:00.370
Ye, ye, yes sir, of course.

01:09:00.370 --> 01:09:02.939
Yes um, I, I'll, I'll be on it.

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:05.542
Yes.

01:09:06.943 --> 01:09:08.478
Of course.

01:09:08.478 --> 01:09:10.314
Yes, yes, no, no,
no, no, no, no,

01:09:10.314 --> 01:09:12.316
I completely understand.

01:09:17.321 --> 01:09:21.858
Of course, no sir, I
will definitely be on it.

01:09:21.858 --> 01:09:23.126
Yes, of course.

01:09:28.163 --> 01:09:30.166
Sure, absolutely I will.

01:09:31.734 --> 01:09:35.138
I'll make sure that's
taken care of too, yes sir.

01:09:35.138 --> 01:09:38.774
Yes, of course, thank you so
much for this opportunity, sir.

01:09:38.774 --> 01:09:42.178
Yes, thank you so
much, all right.

01:09:42.178 --> 01:09:43.011
I'm on it.

01:09:48.718 --> 01:09:52.221
(deep, suspenseful music)

01:10:37.834 --> 01:10:40.337
(scary music)

01:10:46.175 --> 01:10:49.613
Now it's confirmed,
this is the location.

01:10:52.416 --> 01:10:56.185
- You know, if you actually
look at it, all of it,

01:10:56.185 --> 01:11:00.324
you realize it's all
bullshit sexist crap.

01:11:00.324 --> 01:11:03.327
We're always told
to stand behind men.

01:11:03.327 --> 01:11:06.563
Don't be overly proud
of your accomplishments.

01:11:06.563 --> 01:11:10.033
And to always,
always, fucking smile.

01:11:10.033 --> 01:11:12.736
- Okay, and what
accomplishments do you have?

01:11:12.736 --> 01:11:16.640
- Lots, or as much as my
colleagues in the department.

01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:18.308
- Humble, aren't we?

01:11:18.308 --> 01:11:21.144
A bit high and mighty,
don't you think?

01:11:21.144 --> 01:11:23.079
- Hell no, being humble is crap

01:11:23.079 --> 01:11:25.349
when you're a woman
in a man's world.

01:11:25.349 --> 01:11:26.783
Nobody's gonna
give you anything,

01:11:26.783 --> 01:11:28.852
nobody's gonna pump you up.

01:11:28.852 --> 01:11:32.255
Can't expect it from
anybody but yourself.

01:11:32.255 --> 01:11:33.757
- This is boring me.

01:11:33.757 --> 01:11:37.060
- Ha, yeah, because you just
don't pay attention to it.

01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:39.062
You're so comfortable
in your little world

01:11:39.062 --> 01:11:41.331
of being second to man.

01:11:41.331 --> 01:11:44.801
You know the Shedov study
shows you crazy stuff.

01:11:44.801 --> 01:11:47.937
All the oppression we
face, all the damn time.

01:11:47.937 --> 01:11:51.975
- [Meagan] I'm not
oppressed, I have a pool.

01:11:51.975 --> 01:11:54.511
- Oh my god girls, I forgot.

01:11:54.511 --> 01:11:57.347
Having a pool, that's success.

01:11:57.347 --> 01:11:59.516
- [Meagan] It's better
than what you have.

01:11:59.516 --> 01:12:01.050
I need another hit.

01:12:02.218 --> 01:12:05.121
- Oh, where the
hell is everybody?

01:12:05.121 --> 01:12:08.592
This woman hear me roar
crap is killing me.

01:12:08.592 --> 01:12:11.528
- (laughing) I mean, whatever,

01:12:11.528 --> 01:12:13.997
look who I'm talking to anyway.

01:12:13.997 --> 01:12:15.732
- [Kem] What does that mean?

01:12:15.732 --> 01:12:17.501
Who are you talking to?

01:12:17.501 --> 01:12:19.335
- [Meagan] Who
cares, we're stoned.

01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:23.272
- I do, this bitch is
getting on my last nerve.

01:12:24.674 --> 01:12:26.175
- Look Kem, I didn't mean
anything by it, okay.

01:12:26.175 --> 01:12:27.611
I was just messing around.

01:12:27.611 --> 01:12:29.012
- [Meagan] Yeah,
let's just all chill.

01:12:29.012 --> 01:12:29.846
- Hell no.

01:12:31.047 --> 01:12:34.350
You are so fuckin'
stuck up, Rene.

01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:36.019
Look who I'm talkin' to.

01:12:36.019 --> 01:12:37.787
As if your shit doesn't
stink because you're goin' on

01:12:37.787 --> 01:12:40.857
some feminist power trip,
or goin' to grad school.

01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:42.191
Fuck you, bitch.

01:12:43.292 --> 01:12:44.894
You're a fuckin'
stuck up pussy licker,

01:12:44.894 --> 01:12:46.663
you always have been.

01:12:46.663 --> 01:12:50.199
God, the truth is,
nobody likes you here.

01:12:50.199 --> 01:12:51.735
I never did,

01:12:51.735 --> 01:12:54.270
I put up with you
back in that house.

01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:57.340
Shit, that dorky ass
girlfriend you had

01:12:57.340 --> 01:13:00.109
wanted me to go down
on her so many times.

01:13:00.109 --> 01:13:02.078
I had to push her off of me.

01:13:02.078 --> 01:13:05.649
You're an ugly dike, that's
gonna die alone, with a cat.

01:13:05.649 --> 01:13:07.717
Who may, or may
not actually lick

(Rene whimpering)

01:19:21.724 --> 01:19:23.126
- So I got a picture
of the white female,

01:19:23.126 --> 01:19:26.729
age I believe, 20 to
25, she's the suspect.

No.

01:19:34.203 --> 01:19:35.038
Yeah.

01:19:55.458 --> 01:19:58.862
(pulsating, scary tones)

01:20:17.646 --> 01:20:20.316
- On your knees and
drop the weapon.

01:20:20.316 --> 01:20:21.817

move or I'll shoot!

01:20:38.101 --> 01:20:40.269
- She's getting away, man.

01:20:41.504 --> 01:20:44.173
You're letting her
get further away.

01:20:48.677 --> 01:20:50.579

under arrest.

01:20:50.579 --> 01:20:52.215
