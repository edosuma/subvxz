WEBVTT

02:06.920 --> 02:08.480
She looks good.

02:08.640 --> 02:11.200
Bring her in a bit later and
we can have a closer look.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.760
Do you mind if I
ask her a few questions?

02:13.760 --> 02:15.360
-  Keep it brief.
- Okay.

02:23.440 --> 02:25.000
Do you remember where you were?

02:29.400 --> 02:31.040
Take these pills.

02:31.360 --> 02:34.480
Keep a close eye on her and let me
know if anything changes.

02:34.680 --> 02:37.400
I am so proud of you.

02:37.560 --> 02:40.240
I am going to win the Nobel Prize.

02:43.280 --> 02:45.440
Do you know how
long you've been gone for?

02:46.440 --> 02:47.840
No.

02:47.840 --> 02:50.840
Do you remember
anything about what happened?

02:52.600 --> 02:54.120
A place...

02:57.880 --> 02:59.880
Did someone take you?

03:02.640 --> 03:05.960
Do you remember a face or some
clothing?

03:06.520 --> 03:08.680
- No.
- Just, just think.

03:08.680 --> 03:11.000
Anything. Any feature or...

03:12.400 --> 03:14.320
- Anything?
- I don't know.

03:14.320 --> 03:17.320
Okay Dirk, stop.
That's enough.

03:19.160 --> 03:20.760
I've asked her this already.

03:22.080 --> 03:23.680
Come.

03:27.880 --> 03:29.600
So, you still thing she was
abducted?

03:29.600 --> 03:31.280
Right now, it's the only
plausible explanation.

03:31.280 --> 03:33.160
Do you have any
idea where she was?

03:33.160 --> 03:35.200
-  No, we search everywhere.
- Well, not everywhere,

03:35.200 --> 03:37.320
because she was somewhere and you
didn't look there.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.800
She has began hurting
herself again.

03:47.360 --> 03:48.840
I thought she
was doing so well.

03:48.840 --> 03:51.040
She was. She had a set back.

03:51.480 --> 03:53.440
Her old treatment is not working.

03:55.320 --> 03:56.840
So, what can we do?

03:56.840 --> 03:59.160
Well, I have a revolutionary treatment.

03:59.160 --> 04:01.160
It's only days but it's
showing great results.

04:01.160 --> 04:03.360
- What is it?
- It's revolutionary.

04:04.240 --> 04:06.000
Okay. But how so?

04:06.920 --> 04:08.680
We have changed our focus.

04:08.680 --> 04:11.920
We don't treat the trauma, we get rid
of it.

04:12.480 --> 04:13.880
You get rid of it?

04:15.120 --> 04:16.960
- Is it safe?
- Yes.

04:16.960 --> 04:21.880
You have to sign a release form. But
we are seeing fantastic results.

04:23.520 --> 04:27.120
- Will it work for her?
- Well, she's the ideal candidate.

04:27.320 --> 04:31.960
And if she co-operate you can have
her home within three to four months.

04:34.680 --> 04:36.160
And the cost?

04:36.360 --> 04:39.160
Why is it always about the
money with you Charlton?

04:39.840 --> 04:41.480
Because I don't have any.

04:42.560 --> 04:44.360
- I'll speak to Rudy.
- No, no.

04:44.360 --> 04:45.760
I'm already indebted to him
and the community.

04:45.760 --> 04:48.400
No, don't worry about that.
He just wants to help.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.400
- Can I see her?
- Well, she's paranoid, delusional.

04:56.600 --> 05:00.000
- She thinks we want to kill her.
- Please.

05:01.960 --> 05:03.560
Okay.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.480
But be prepared

05:12.440 --> 05:14.520
Where you ever going to tell me about
the diamond?

05:14.520 --> 05:16.440
- Yes, I was.
- No, bullshit.

05:16.720 --> 05:18.320
I know that's why I'm
doing the dirty work.

05:18.320 --> 05:21.200
Look, if we don't access to the bend
then there aren't any diamonds.

05:21.200 --> 05:23.400
- And if there aren't any diamonds...
- Then, then what?

05:23.400 --> 05:25.040
- Then we are screwed, Max.
- Bullshit, man.

05:25.040 --> 05:26.520
With all this rain we've had.

05:26.520 --> 05:28.200
It's going great,
it's going better than ever.

05:28.200 --> 05:30.560
Look, all you need to know is Yola
needs to sign.

05:30.560 --> 05:34.360
Yola? Rudy, what are you
not telling me, huh?

05:34.960 --> 05:36.640
I'm you brother, don't you trust me.

05:36.640 --> 05:37.960
You should just keep your mouth shut,

05:37.960 --> 05:39.480
Because if this gets out, we are fucked.

05:39.480 --> 05:41.440
Oh, now it's we are fucked?

05:41.440 --> 05:43.080
Just a second ago, I was only good enough...

05:43.080 --> 05:45.120
It's always been we, Max.

05:46.480 --> 05:50.200
I'm just trying to look after us,
okay? So just trust me.

05:51.480 --> 05:53.080
Okay.

05:53.400 --> 05:55.000
Okay fine.

05:55.280 --> 05:57.120
What do you want me
to do about the bones?

05:57.760 --> 06:00.080
Get rid of them. Get Danie and
Gus to help you or something.

06:00.080 --> 06:03.440
- Danie's not answering his phone.
- Well, find him and get it done.

06:14.360 --> 06:17.200
Hey Dickie boy. Have you seen Danie?

06:17.560 --> 06:19.600
- No. Why?
- Oh,

06:19.600 --> 06:22.560
tried to get hold of him all morning.
He's not answering his phone.

06:23.160 --> 06:24.600
Well, have you tried his house?

06:25.080 --> 06:27.080
Went by his place,
but there is no car.

06:28.400 --> 06:29.960
Then I can't help you.

07:06.200 --> 07:08.120
Yeah, nothing much. Nothing much.

07:37.160 --> 07:39.280
- Are you nervous?
- No.

07:40.320 --> 07:42.480
If you don't close now,
you never will.

07:42.840 --> 07:44.360
Shut up, Rudy.

07:46.360 --> 07:47.760
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:47.760 --> 07:50.520
We just came to see Yola.
We heard she was back.

07:50.520 --> 07:52.440
Oh yeah. It's not a good time

07:52.720 --> 07:54.920
Won't be long.
Just came to check up on you both.

07:54.920 --> 07:57.000
- In and out. I promise.
- Yeah. Quick.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.200
She's not ready for visitors.

07:59.200 --> 08:01.440
Come on. Max even brought flowers.

08:01.440 --> 08:03.560
Check here. Huh?

08:06.040 --> 08:08.400
- Alright, make it quick.
- Thank you.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.640
Hey.

08:29.440 --> 08:31.040
Hey.

08:31.280 --> 08:32.960
How you doing?

08:33.640 --> 08:35.040
Huh?

08:38.960 --> 08:40.560
They...

08:40.560 --> 08:42.320
They killed her.

08:45.560 --> 08:47.160
She’s confused.

08:47.440 --> 08:48.800
Who?

08:49.160 --> 08:50.560
She was...

08:50.960 --> 08:52.840
She was bleeding everywhere.

08:56.960 --> 08:59.040
Listen, you're going to get help.
Okay?

09:00.160 --> 09:02.440
You're going to get all
the help you need. I promise.

09:02.760 --> 09:04.720
They're going to kill me too.

09:06.720 --> 09:09.040
I warned you
about the paranoia.

09:10.280 --> 09:13.680
You're going to be okay.
Alright? It's going to be okay.

09:16.080 --> 09:17.560
Red rooms.

09:18.080 --> 09:19.560
It's hell.

09:23.920 --> 09:25.720
You're going to get better. Okay?

09:25.720 --> 09:27.800
You are going to get better
and you're going to come home.

09:27.800 --> 09:30.960
- It's hell.
- It's time. You're upsetting her.

09:37.840 --> 09:40.360
- I have to go. Okay?
- No.

09:42.120 --> 09:45.760
You bleed from your eyes, your ears.

09:49.400 --> 09:51.040
- Okay.
- No

09:52.520 --> 09:55.200
I'll come back. Okay?
I promise. I'll come back.

09:55.200 --> 09:57.000
It's going to be okay.

09:58.280 --> 10:00.800
You have to let me go. Clara...

10:02.600 --> 10:03.920
Let me go.

10:14.600 --> 10:16.520
So much blood.

10:36.160 --> 10:38.400
- Hello.
-  Max.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.320
-  Hey
-  Rudy.

10:40.320 --> 10:41.600
Hi.

10:42.760 --> 10:45.200
Yola. Uh, these are for you.

10:48.760 --> 10:49.640
Thank you.

10:49.640 --> 10:52.120
We are so glad you're back.
We were very worried.

10:52.120 --> 10:54.360
Yeah. And you look so well.

10:57.840 --> 10:59.760
Let me put this in the water for you.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.080
Oh. I'm fine.

11:03.600 --> 11:04.760
I'm fine.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.280
Okay.

11:28.880 --> 11:30.480
Hi.

11:32.040 --> 11:33.400
Yola.

11:35.800 --> 11:37.240
It's so good to see you.

11:51.480 --> 11:53.920
- Sienna told me about...
-  Ah. Sienna,

11:53.920 --> 11:55.680
somebody is here to see you.

11:56.160 --> 11:57.680
Sienna.

12:01.360 --> 12:02.840
I am so sorry.

12:02.840 --> 12:04.480
I wanted to warn you.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.600
Why is she acting so strange?

12:07.480 --> 12:09.160
I don't think she's acting.

12:10.080 --> 12:12.400
She doesn’t recognize me, she...

12:14.320 --> 12:17.200
- When did she come back?
- Last night.

12:17.200 --> 12:18.720
Late.

12:19.440 --> 12:21.640
Is there something strange about her?

12:23.040 --> 12:24.960
Uh. Everything.

12:28.440 --> 12:30.040
Come... Come in. Come in.

12:42.400 --> 12:44.160
Didn't know where you were.

12:45.200 --> 12:46.880
Glad that you came back.

12:50.120 --> 12:51.920
Thought I might never see you again.

12:52.960 --> 12:54.960
I picked these for you.

12:56.160 --> 12:59.520
- Um, they're not fancy but...
- They're lovely.

13:10.040 --> 13:12.000
Shall I just put these here?

13:16.920 --> 13:18.600
I was worried about you.

13:22.880 --> 13:24.680
Yola.

13:26.040 --> 13:27.840
Your guests are waiting for you.

14:46.920 --> 14:48.800
Thanks so much for coming.

14:49.080 --> 14:50.600
You’re welcome.

14:51.680 --> 14:54.800
Just give her time.
She’s not herself yet.

14:56.200 --> 14:57.600
She doesn't remember me.

14:57.600 --> 14:59.360
Don't take it to heart.

15:01.280 --> 15:02.960
Where else am I meant to take it?

15:20.240 --> 15:21.800
Hey.

15:22.360 --> 15:25.360
- Hey
- Uh, where are the others?

15:26.640 --> 15:28.120
I'm not sure.

15:28.760 --> 15:31.600
- And Yola?
- I think she went to the bathroom.

15:32.720 --> 15:34.400
- Okay.
- Don’t worry.

15:34.560 --> 15:36.000
She'll be fine.

15:37.360 --> 15:39.280
- Oh, Sienna.
- Yeah.

15:42.040 --> 15:46.560
Olly said that it's very important
that she gets one of these at night.

15:46.560 --> 15:48.000
- Okay.
- It will help her sleep.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.480
Okay.

15:49.800 --> 15:52.200
He's afraid that she might
suffer from insomnia.

15:52.640 --> 15:53.800
- Okay.
- And nightmares.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.560
Okay. Got it. One at night.

15:59.720 --> 16:01.200
Yola?

16:02.280 --> 16:05.000
So this is just your
initial at the bottom of the page.

16:06.680 --> 16:08.360
Good. Initial.

16:09.360 --> 16:10.960
Initial.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.200
Yola?

16:17.200 --> 16:18.920
Initial.

16:19.560 --> 16:21.160
Initial.

16:22.120 --> 16:23.800
Yola?

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Good. Initial.

16:32.440 --> 16:34.960
And on... No, no. Initial there.

16:35.120 --> 16:37.200
- And now your full signature there.
-  Yola?

16:38.800 --> 16:40.400
- Franz?
- Good.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.040
- When did you get here?
- Uh...

16:42.040 --> 16:45.040
Sienna you were busy,
so I just let myself in.

16:45.720 --> 16:47.120
Initial.

16:47.120 --> 16:49.800
- What are you doing?
- Signing the contract.

16:49.960 --> 16:51.800
- Initial.
- The contract. The one you gave me?

16:51.800 --> 16:53.160
- Yeah, I can explain.
- No, no, no.

16:53.160 --> 16:54.520
- I can explain.
- No, no. She is not...

16:54.520 --> 16:56.600
She's within her rights
to sign this contract.

16:56.600 --> 16:59.280
She's in no state to sign anything.
Look at her.

16:59.280 --> 17:01.680
- As soon as she signs--
- Really? Behind my back.

17:02.080 --> 17:04.640
- Come on.
- Unbelievable. Get out.

17:05.720 --> 17:07.000
- Just listen to me--
- I'm serious.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.120
Get out, both of you. Right now!

17:49.760 --> 17:51.440
Hey. Yola.

17:51.440 --> 17:53.920
Sorry I was looking for the bathroom.

17:54.480 --> 17:57.040
It's been a while,
but it is so good to see you.

17:57.040 --> 17:58.720
I'll see you around, yeah?

18:29.040 --> 18:30.040
Hey.

18:30.920 --> 18:32.320
What's wrong?

18:33.000 --> 18:34.440
She didn't sign.

18:34.800 --> 18:36.520
Oh. Why not?

18:36.840 --> 18:38.280
Sienna.

18:38.840 --> 18:40.200
Oh.

18:40.520 --> 18:41.880
Well.

18:42.520 --> 18:44.240
I did warn you.

18:44.240 --> 18:45.720
She's a feisty one, huh?

18:45.720 --> 18:47.640
Yeah and where the fuck
were you, huh? Snooping?

18:47.640 --> 18:50.320
Jesus, if your perpetual hard-on
for her is going to get in the way

18:50.320 --> 18:51.720
- of what we're trying to achieve.
- Okay. Whoa. Whoa.

18:51.720 --> 18:53.960
Stop. Stop. Let's not
talk about my hard-on, okay?

18:53.960 --> 18:56.320
Let's talk about yours. Huh?

18:56.320 --> 18:58.840
- I thought you and Sienna were done?
- Yeah. We are.

18:59.360 --> 19:01.280
Oh. Okay.

19:02.520 --> 19:04.200
Fucking child.

19:06.320 --> 19:08.880
Don't you fucking judge me,
you asshole.

20:00.360 --> 20:02.560
Sorry. I'm bursting.

20:05.280 --> 20:07.520
Rudy is unbelievable.

20:14.560 --> 20:15.920
No.

20:33.320 --> 20:34.800
Are you okay?

20:39.800 --> 20:41.200
Yola.

20:41.600 --> 20:43.040
What's up?

20:47.480 --> 20:49.960
Yola, talk to me.
You're freaking me out.

20:50.720 --> 20:52.400
What's going on?

20:54.280 --> 20:56.280
In your head, what's going on?

20:57.960 --> 20:59.320
I don't know.

21:02.760 --> 21:04.240
Come here.

21:15.600 --> 21:17.000
Danie.

21:22.480 --> 21:23.880
Hello?

23:08.920 --> 23:10.520
Hey!

23:16.360 --> 23:17.960
Hey!

23:31.360 --> 23:32.960
Hey!

23:46.160 --> 23:49.360
And leaping.
Good. Leap, big leaps.

23:50.920 --> 23:53.000
Big, elegant leaps.

23:54.240 --> 23:55.840
Right.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.520
Um...

23:58.000 --> 24:01.080
Uh... Alright everyone, stop, please.
Thank you.

24:01.720 --> 24:04.920
It's not working, um...
Just try the striding.

24:05.280 --> 24:08.680
Swans. Like we did it yesterday.
Thank you, everyone. Go.

24:08.960 --> 24:11.800
- And use those hands.

24:11.960 --> 24:13.680
I'm a willow tree.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.240
Good. That's lovely.

24:18.480 --> 24:20.200
Good girls.

24:20.200 --> 24:22.400
And pull in more to your left.

24:23.240 --> 24:24.840
Towards me.

24:25.720 --> 24:27.680
- Amelia, concentrate.
- Have you chosen yet?

24:27.680 --> 24:29.440
- No.
-  Towards me.

24:29.440 --> 24:31.400
But there are one or two
that I really like.

24:33.120 --> 24:34.720
Which ones?

24:35.240 --> 24:37.720
I've marked them all
on the back of the photos.

24:37.920 --> 24:40.240
Number three, number five.

24:40.240 --> 24:42.600
The second to last,
she's quite pretty.

24:43.960 --> 24:46.320
Don't go too dark.
Think of the children.

24:46.320 --> 24:49.200
- Ah.
-  Good. That's lovely.

24:49.200 --> 24:51.600
Well, then either number three
or number five.

24:52.360 --> 24:55.400
Well, they're both popular
so make up your mind.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
And pull in more
to your left.

25:00.360 --> 25:01.920
Number three.

25:02.760 --> 25:04.400
Good choice.

25:04.400 --> 25:05.680
She'll make a good wife.

25:05.680 --> 25:08.200
Good girls. Towards me.

25:08.560 --> 25:11.200
- I'm so happy for you Franz.
- Good.

25:11.720 --> 25:14.160
Sandra has been gone a long time.

25:15.120 --> 25:16.920
I know you miss her.

25:19.320 --> 25:22.200
- Every day.
-  Come towards me.

26:09.320 --> 26:11.720
Yola, stay in the car, please.

26:12.640 --> 26:14.200
I'll be quick.

26:57.080 --> 26:58.680
Hey!

27:19.120 --> 27:21.520
Ah, Sienna.

27:21.520 --> 27:23.080
How can I help you?

27:23.480 --> 27:26.720
Um. I think I um... I have um...

27:28.160 --> 27:31.040
- Thrush.
- Thrush!

27:31.040 --> 27:32.680
I have just the thing.

27:34.160 --> 27:36.800
Would you like the capsule
or the cream?

27:38.200 --> 27:39.880
Capsules?

27:42.720 --> 27:44.680
There you go.

27:45.560 --> 27:49.480
And this is my own personal recipe.

27:50.480 --> 27:52.800
Great antifungal properties.

27:55.320 --> 27:59.200
Just add it to your bath water.

28:00.920 --> 28:04.600
-  Thanks.
- Be sure to keep it dry down there.

28:04.600 --> 28:07.280
Thanks.

28:24.760 --> 28:26.240
Yola?

28:28.600 --> 28:29.960
Yola?

28:35.280 --> 28:39.480
Jesus,
how much more of these are there?

28:41.160 --> 28:43.400
Look at this one, huh?

28:44.200 --> 28:46.040
It's buggered.

28:54.760 --> 28:56.600
Yeah.

31:02.640 --> 31:07.240
- It's going to look wonderful.
- Mmm-hmm.

31:09.920 --> 31:11.760
What's going on now?

31:13.280 --> 31:14.800
It's Catherine.

31:15.800 --> 31:18.200
It looks as if she is having fun.

31:19.200 --> 31:21.520
Too much fun for my liking.

31:23.080 --> 31:24.800
That girl Thuli.

31:26.920 --> 31:28.640
I know what that is.

31:28.760 --> 31:31.040
And I don't want it for my daughter.

31:31.960 --> 31:33.680
Just breathe.

31:43.400 --> 31:45.320
I'll keep an eye on it.

31:51.560 --> 31:53.280
Yola! Oh my God.

31:55.480 --> 31:57.160
What are you doing?

31:57.160 --> 31:59.040
I told you to stay in the car.

31:59.480 --> 32:01.800
Come. You're going
to give me a heart attack.

32:01.800 --> 32:04.600
Yolanda? Hi.

32:05.280 --> 32:07.560
It's so wonderful to have you back.

32:07.560 --> 32:10.240
You will both be joining us
for the dance, won't you?

32:12.200 --> 32:13.560
The dance?

32:15.080 --> 32:17.760
The daughters of Jacob dance.

32:18.240 --> 32:20.040
We haven't had one in years.

32:20.040 --> 32:22.440
And we haven't been able to do the
river initiation

32:22.440 --> 32:25.920
because of the drought. So, this year
is going to be really special.

32:25.920 --> 32:28.880
We have a lot of girls and if you two
would come along,

32:28.880 --> 32:32.240
- it would just be perfect.
- Two real daughters of Jacob.

32:33.640 --> 32:34.960
Yip.

32:35.240 --> 32:37.480
No. No. Thanks.

32:38.160 --> 32:40.280
Okay, come. Let's go.

32:50.960 --> 32:52.680
Don't do it again, okay?

33:03.280 --> 33:04.840
Hey.

33:06.280 --> 33:09.120
Uh... When last did you see Danie?

33:09.120 --> 33:11.600
Um... Yesterday at the dam?

33:13.560 --> 33:17.040
- You haven't seen him since?
- No. Why?

33:18.680 --> 33:20.360
He's missing.

33:21.280 --> 33:22.800
Okay.

33:23.680 --> 33:25.600
Why are you telling me this?

33:27.840 --> 33:29.440
Dirk?

33:30.600 --> 33:33.360
What do you think?
Do you think he took Yola?

33:35.160 --> 33:37.000
I'm looking into it.

33:38.800 --> 33:40.960
I'll let you know if I have more.

34:15.480 --> 34:17.520
Let's do this.

34:28.920 --> 34:30.480
Ouch.

34:45.640 --> 34:47.320
Oh wow!

34:47.800 --> 34:50.160
Check this thing out. Huh.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.680
- What do you think happened?
-  You and your BB gun.

34:55.680 --> 34:59.080
- Nah. Hole's not big enough.

34:59.080 --> 35:02.680
- I'm keeping this one.
- Just don't let anybody see it.

35:04.080 --> 35:05.760
No.

35:08.680 --> 35:12.880
Give me that big one.
Let's see what this fucker can do.

35:23.840 --> 35:25.800
Oh, fuck.

35:28.080 --> 35:29.880
What the hell?

35:31.560 --> 35:33.120
Gus, what did you do?

35:33.120 --> 35:35.480
Nothing, just what you told me to do.

35:35.760 --> 35:37.560
Bullshit.

36:26.120 --> 36:29.200
- Themba?

36:43.840 --> 36:46.080
Themba?

37:11.280 --> 37:13.880
- Do you remember Danie?
- Who?

37:14.360 --> 37:15.920
Danie.

37:16.520 --> 37:18.120
Dad's friend.

37:19.680 --> 37:21.120
Big guy?

37:28.560 --> 37:30.160
Okay.

37:30.160 --> 37:32.280
I'll find a photo of him
and show you.

37:39.520 --> 37:42.240
- Your hair needs a trim.

37:57.720 --> 37:59.120
What is that?

38:09.160 --> 38:10.760
Look.

38:15.440 --> 38:17.120
What is that?

38:17.120 --> 38:18.560
Sienna?

38:18.560 --> 38:20.120
Hi.

38:24.480 --> 38:26.120
I'm just checking in.

38:27.240 --> 38:29.600
- I'm fine.
- Why don't you go home?

38:31.520 --> 38:34.680
- I'll take care of her.
- No. Thanks, aunty Dora.

38:36.560 --> 38:39.640
She's my sister.
I need to take care of her.

38:39.800 --> 38:43.280
- And what about work tomorrow?
- It's fine. I'll leave early.

38:46.320 --> 38:47.840
Are you sure?

38:48.320 --> 38:49.640
Yes.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.840
Well, phone me
if you need anything.

38:53.800 --> 38:55.280
I will.

38:55.680 --> 38:57.120
I will.

39:28.120 --> 39:32.280
- Yoh, what's wrong with you?

39:35.960 --> 39:37.840
Feels like I breathed in
a whole person.

39:37.840 --> 39:40.600
- Oh. No man.
- Just the bottom half.

39:43.640 --> 39:46.080
- See you tomorrow. Yeah.
- Yeah. Thanks for coming hey.

41:12.240 --> 41:13.840
Nice.

45:28.080 --> 45:29.680
Yolanda.
