00:15.643 --> 00:17.133
Dr. Greene?

00:18.412 --> 00:19.845
Dr. Greene!

00:21.950 --> 00:23.042
What is it?

00:23.252 --> 00:24.514
Patient for you, Dr. Greene.

00:25.520 --> 00:26.646
Can't the intern take it?

00:26.855 --> 00:28.253
No, it's for you.

00:28.456 --> 00:30.822
- What time is it?
- Five o'clock.

00:35.664 --> 00:37.291
All right.

00:39.635 --> 00:42.035
- Can't the intern take it?
- It's Dr. Ross.

00:45.374 --> 00:47.274
Dr. Ross.

00:47.542 --> 00:48.839
I'll be right there.

01:27.617 --> 01:28.949
Come on, Doug.

01:29.786 --> 01:32.085
Markie-boy! Did I wake you up?

01:32.289 --> 01:33.688
Yes, you did.

01:34.191 --> 01:36.352
I want you to know
you're a real friend

01:36.560 --> 01:38.494
- That's all right.
- Real friend.

01:38.696 --> 01:40.823
- Do we have a room?
- Room 3 is free.

01:41.031 --> 01:42.795
Room three is free!

01:43.000 --> 01:45.195
Three is free. Free for three.

01:45.469 --> 01:47.461
- Come on, Doug.
- All right, I gotcha.

01:47.671 --> 01:49.606
<i>But come ye back</i>

01:49.808 --> 01:52.605
<i>When summer's in the meadow</i>

01:57.716 --> 01:59.013
I can't tell you...

01:59.217 --> 02:01.742
...how much I appreciate this, Mark.

02:02.454 --> 02:04.150
I'm a little under the weather.

02:12.164 --> 02:15.257
D5, NS. I need the dextrose.

02:15.468 --> 02:18.459
- Give him 600 of ASA.
- Aspirin.

02:18.636 --> 02:20.036
I almost forgot aspirin.

02:20.506 --> 02:22.132
So anyway...

02:23.976 --> 02:25.944
...she says to me, she says...

02:26.745 --> 02:30.705
..."I didn't know that pediatricians
could be so sexy."

02:30.916 --> 02:34.853
And I said, "Honey, you ain't seen
nothing yet."

02:37.456 --> 02:40.254
All right. Give me the fast drip.
I need the hydration.

02:40.460 --> 02:42.894
Don't worry, Doug. Just lie back.

02:45.432 --> 02:47.160
How's your beautiful wife, Jennifer?

02:47.367 --> 02:48.561
She's fine, really.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.599
You two settle your problems?

02:50.804 --> 02:52.169
Everything's okay.

02:52.372 --> 02:54.772
Hate to lose you in the ER, you know.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.736
- Lie back.
- I am.

03:00.547 --> 03:03.015
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate this.

03:03.217 --> 03:04.774
Really do.

03:05.919 --> 03:07.386
Here's your aspirin.

03:07.587 --> 03:09.351
Give him 2000cc's
in a fast drip.

03:09.556 --> 03:11.081
Don't let it run dry.

03:11.292 --> 03:12.623
Does he always do this?

03:12.827 --> 03:14.818
Only on his nights off.

03:15.863 --> 03:18.730
I'm going to bed.
Wake me at 6:30.

03:30.845 --> 03:32.039
Doctor Greene?

03:32.246 --> 03:34.112
Doctor Greene? Mark!

03:35.017 --> 03:36.245
What is it?

03:36.452 --> 03:38.886
Can I give Mrs. Williston
more Demerol?

03:39.087 --> 03:40.817
50 milligrams, I.M.

03:41.056 --> 03:42.182
Thanks, Mark.

03:48.997 --> 03:50.464
- Dr. Greene!
- What is it?

03:50.666 --> 03:52.600
6:30, Dr. Greene.

03:59.976 --> 04:01.341
- Hey, Timmy.
- Morning, Dr. Lewis.

04:01.544 --> 04:03.238
Oh, Dr. Lewis!

04:05.514 --> 04:07.107
Thank you.

04:08.184 --> 04:10.448
- Good morning, Dr. Benton.
- Hey, Jerry.

04:11.554 --> 04:14.148
<i>This was the scene at 6: 15
this morning...</i>

04:14.357 --> 04:17.154
<i>... where a building
collapsed during construction.</i>

04:17.360 --> 04:19.226
Any estimate on the injuries?

04:20.464 --> 04:21.930
How long before they arrive?

04:22.132 --> 04:25.000
<i>- 12 people injured
and 2 dead.</i>

04:25.702 --> 04:28.570
Oh, yeah? That soon?

04:29.038 --> 04:30.734
- What's up, Timmy?
- Hey, Dr. Benton.

04:30.941 --> 04:33.273
Notify trauma.
An accident in the Loop.

04:33.477 --> 04:35.672
Twelve injuries, seven critical.

04:38.449 --> 04:40.679
Good day for us surgeons.

04:40.885 --> 04:42.409
Mrs. Willis in 4 needs a CBC.

04:42.620 --> 04:46.886
The man in 5 is a rule-out MI waiting
for cardiac enzymes and 12 units.

04:47.091 --> 04:50.822
Dr. Ross is in 3, sleeping it off.
Wake him and get him out of there.

04:51.029 --> 04:52.155
I need a uric acid...

04:52.364 --> 04:53.524
What's this is all about?

04:53.732 --> 04:55.962
Building collapsed.
They're sending us a dozen.

04:56.167 --> 04:58.658
- Yeah, well, who's on?
- Just us.

04:58.869 --> 05:02.328
Forget all that. Call Susan Lewis.
Call the 7th and 8th floor.

05:02.541 --> 05:05.533
Tell them we need anybody
they can spare. Do that now.

05:09.514 --> 05:10.879
Take him to Trauma Room 2.

05:11.082 --> 05:13.847
What's your name, sir?
Can you tell me your name?

05:14.052 --> 05:16.214
- Next to 3. That way.
- Which way?

05:16.388 --> 05:17.378
That way!

05:21.459 --> 05:24.293
Take him to 1.
Down to the end, on the right.

05:24.497 --> 05:26.897
- What's your name, sir?
- It's Wilson.

05:27.098 --> 05:28.657
What is your address?

05:31.737 --> 05:32.965
Mr. Wilson?

05:33.172 --> 05:34.537
Get it later.

05:34.740 --> 05:36.935
Let's go. Let's bring him in.

05:38.511 --> 05:41.208
And on my count. On three.
One, two...

05:41.414 --> 05:42.404
...three!

05:44.250 --> 05:45.308
How you doing, sir?

05:45.519 --> 05:47.645
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

05:47.854 --> 05:50.879
Sorry about the suit.
So is it just your hand?

05:51.090 --> 05:52.148
Let's see. Light?

05:52.359 --> 05:53.656
Light! Let's move.

05:53.860 --> 05:56.090
Have nice, pleasant thoughts.

05:56.296 --> 05:58.230
Let's have a CBC...

05:58.432 --> 06:01.458
...type and cross-match.
We got a pre- op here.

06:01.668 --> 06:04.068
Notify the O.R., get us a room.

06:04.271 --> 06:07.934
Call Vascular and call Orthopedic.
Tell them to come down now.

06:08.142 --> 06:09.904
This is their lucky day.

06:10.110 --> 06:14.207
Mr. Wilson, your hand is barely
attached, but it's gonna be okay.

06:14.415 --> 06:16.848
Give me an EKG and X-ray
of his wrist and hand.

06:17.050 --> 06:19.815
- Can you feel anything in your hand?
- No.

06:20.387 --> 06:22.185
We'll save your hand,
don't worry.

06:22.390 --> 06:23.652
Clear!

06:25.125 --> 06:27.026
Mr. Jackson, where does it hurt?

06:27.929 --> 06:29.692
Where does it hurt, Mr. Jackson?

06:29.897 --> 06:32.059
Does it hurt when you breathe in?

06:32.667 --> 06:34.658
Have you been coughing up any blood?

06:34.869 --> 06:36.861
Okay, let me take a listen.

06:39.241 --> 06:40.265
Dr. Lewis!

06:40.476 --> 06:42.444
Okay. Where are we taking him?

06:50.486 --> 06:53.046
Do you have any pain in your head?

06:53.255 --> 06:55.120
How about your neck?
Any pain here?

06:57.893 --> 07:00.088
What I want you to do now...

07:00.296 --> 07:03.629
I want you to tell me if
it hurts you when you breathe.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.160
I don't get a BP.

07:05.368 --> 07:07.927
Start two large bore IVs.
Saline, wide open.

07:08.137 --> 07:11.733
Type and cross for 10 units, get me
4 units of O-negative, stat.

07:11.941 --> 07:15.206
Drop an NG tube
and get Dr. Benton in here.

07:15.412 --> 07:17.403
This is no place for a pediatrician.

07:17.614 --> 07:19.844
No sensation: Radial, median or ulnar.

07:20.050 --> 07:22.382
No pulses. Color and
temperature as you see.

07:22.585 --> 07:24.644
He's gotten 500cc's saline.

07:24.854 --> 07:26.845
Crit's 32-5, type and cross-match sent.

07:27.057 --> 07:29.821
X-ray's waiting. O.R. Will have
a room in 10 minutes.

07:30.027 --> 07:31.494
Let's get him out of here.

07:31.761 --> 07:33.956
You think you can save the hand?

07:34.164 --> 07:35.461
It looks good. I think so.

07:35.666 --> 07:38.191
I told him you could.
He's counting on you.

07:38.402 --> 07:39.868
Peter, you're a smart-ass.

07:40.070 --> 07:42.539
You'd love to do this case,
wouldn't you?

07:43.674 --> 07:45.335
I'm ready.
I could do it.

07:45.543 --> 07:46.805
You're a resident, Peter.

07:47.011 --> 07:49.445
You're years from a case like this.

07:51.782 --> 07:53.249
- How many fingers?
- Three.

07:53.451 --> 07:55.544
- What's your name?
- Jeff Barr.

07:55.753 --> 07:57.653
- Where are you?
- Cook County General.

07:57.855 --> 07:59.824
- What's today?
- St. Patrick's Day.

08:00.024 --> 08:02.686
You're fine.
Get a set of facial bones.

08:02.894 --> 08:05.260
You're gonna be just fine, Mr. Barr.

08:05.897 --> 08:07.797
- You're beautiful, doc.
- Thank you.

08:07.999 --> 08:09.590
- You married?
- No, I'm a doctor.

08:09.801 --> 08:11.826
- Then, listen...
- Take it easy, Mr. Barr.

08:12.037 --> 08:14.699
You don't want to fall on your face
twice in one day.

08:16.476 --> 08:17.773
How much did she vomit?

08:17.976 --> 08:19.341
A couple hundred cc's.

08:19.544 --> 08:21.705
Would you please take a deep breath?

08:21.913 --> 08:24.347
Good. Now another.
Any pain there?

08:25.217 --> 08:26.845
Okay, how about here?

08:28.187 --> 08:29.211
Call O.R., get a room.

08:29.389 --> 08:30.855
- What is her crit?
- 23.

08:32.525 --> 08:33.856
Wait a minute. Here we go!

08:34.059 --> 08:35.458
No pulse. Code blue.

08:35.828 --> 08:37.796
- Call the time.
- 8:37.

08:38.464 --> 08:40.328
Paddles!
That's a shockable rhythm.

08:40.533 --> 08:42.558
Let's move! Here we go.

08:42.769 --> 08:44.030
Nice and easy.

08:44.437 --> 08:45.631
Clear!

08:49.275 --> 08:51.175
- No response.
- Get me an amp of epi...

08:51.377 --> 08:53.938
...and a hundred lidocaine.
Let's move it.

08:54.548 --> 08:58.006
Okay, what've we got here?
Where are the paramedics?

08:58.351 --> 08:59.683
Get his clothes off him.

08:59.887 --> 09:02.378
Give me something. I can't stand it!

09:02.589 --> 09:04.580
I'll give you something for the pain.

09:04.792 --> 09:07.523
Notify the orthopods we have
an open fracture.

09:07.761 --> 09:09.889
Give him tetanus and 5
of morphine right away.

09:10.097 --> 09:11.894
- Does it hurt anywhere else?
- My knee.

09:12.100 --> 09:13.691
- Need help?
- Check his knee.

09:16.069 --> 09:17.059
Here we go.

09:19.540 --> 09:22.840
We got patients on surgical
2 and 3. One of them looks bad.

09:23.043 --> 09:24.909
Fine, but this woman's
heart stopped...

09:25.113 --> 09:27.980
...and she needs it. Call the AR.
- They're in surgery.

09:28.183 --> 09:29.775
Get them.
Can't you see I'm busy?

09:29.984 --> 09:31.042
- Time?
- Two minutes.

09:31.252 --> 09:34.745
Come on, sweetheart.
You make us a little nervous here.

09:34.956 --> 09:36.150
Paddles. Let's go.

09:38.026 --> 09:39.084
Clear.

09:41.095 --> 09:42.255
Is that a blip?

09:43.531 --> 09:44.896
There it is.

09:45.733 --> 09:46.961
Come on.

09:47.168 --> 09:48.636
Come on back to us.

09:48.838 --> 09:51.898
Keep it pumping.
I think she's coming back.

09:52.107 --> 09:53.574
Bring her back for me, baby.

09:54.643 --> 09:58.010
Come on back to us.
Come on, baby. Yes!

09:58.214 --> 09:59.977
That one to Trauma 3.

10:00.182 --> 10:02.241
That's down the hall and to the left.

10:04.920 --> 10:06.114
Call Pathology. We got one...

10:06.322 --> 10:08.688
...who won't be charged.
The name's Canelli.

10:09.425 --> 10:11.950
Canelli?
Relatives of Robert Canelli.

10:12.161 --> 10:13.754
Right here.

10:16.032 --> 10:18.057
- I'm his son.
- Hi, I'm Mark Greene.

10:18.268 --> 10:19.428
My father, he's...

10:19.636 --> 10:22.628
Your father was in an accident,
you know that?

10:22.839 --> 10:23.828
Come with me, please.

10:24.040 --> 10:27.908
No, just tell me. He's here, right?
Just tell me.

10:28.678 --> 10:32.580
Mr. Canelli, your father
had a heart attack...

10:32.783 --> 10:36.344
...and we were unable to revive him.
I'm sorry.

10:37.888 --> 10:40.186
You bastard! You bastards!

10:43.628 --> 10:45.528
You're sorry?

10:59.143 --> 11:01.271
Come over here.

11:04.148 --> 11:05.376
That will make you
feel better.

11:05.584 --> 11:08.848
And we'll have you in the O.R.
In no time, okay?

11:12.591 --> 11:14.923
- Any others?
- No, that's it.

11:15.127 --> 11:17.925
- That's it?
- Yeah. Last two were DO A.

11:19.498 --> 11:20.624
That's it.

11:20.832 --> 11:22.561
Yeah, for now.

11:38.450 --> 11:41.352
<i>Orderly, please bring
a wheelchair to Admitting.</i>

11:41.554 --> 11:44.546
<i>Orderly, please bring
a wheelchair to Admitting.</i>

11:44.724 --> 11:46.749
- Where's Ross?
- He went to change.

11:46.960 --> 11:48.895
Somebody threw up on him.

11:49.095 --> 11:51.859
- That lady.
- The lady who arrested?

11:52.065 --> 11:53.896
- She make it?
- We got her going again.

11:54.435 --> 11:56.629
She's got a junctional rhythm,
but she's going.

11:56.837 --> 11:58.361
What about that guy's hand?

11:58.571 --> 12:00.301
They're still in surgery.

12:00.507 --> 12:03.304
They're gonna be working
all day on that one.

12:04.612 --> 12:06.045
- Anybody want coffee?
- I do.

12:06.547 --> 12:07.536
How do you take it?

12:07.748 --> 12:09.716
Same as yesterday and the day before.

12:09.917 --> 12:12.181
And they call me a smart-ass.

12:12.621 --> 12:14.053
You get any sleep last night?

12:14.254 --> 12:15.585
About an hour.

12:16.157 --> 12:19.125
The nurses raided the coffee.
Why don't they make their own?

12:19.326 --> 12:20.658
I'm gonna tell them.

12:20.862 --> 12:22.124
Never mind.

12:24.565 --> 12:27.056
Okay. Never mind.

12:29.571 --> 12:32.199
Aren't we getting
some new students today?

12:32.540 --> 12:34.235
Yeah, I think so.

12:34.442 --> 12:37.070
I hope they're good.
The last two were hopeless.

12:43.618 --> 12:46.553
- Something wrong?
- Oh, you bet there is.

12:46.756 --> 12:50.453
We're out of coffee again because
the nurses have been taking it.

12:51.026 --> 12:54.087
- Make some more.
- Make some more?

12:54.764 --> 12:57.198
We work 36 hours on, 18 off...

12:57.400 --> 12:59.527
...which is 90 hours a week,
52 weeks a year.

12:59.735 --> 13:03.933
For that we are paid
$23,739 before taxes.

13:04.140 --> 13:06.301
And we also have to make the coffee?

13:06.709 --> 13:07.767
My heart is breaking.

13:12.682 --> 13:15.015
- Where are the filters?
- In the refrigerator.

13:15.685 --> 13:19.143
<i>Dr. Greene, your wife is waiting
in the cafeteria. Dr. Greene.</i>

13:19.355 --> 13:20.948
Damn it!

13:24.661 --> 13:26.356
Everything's fine.

13:35.072 --> 13:36.937
Morning, Dr. Greene.

13:46.550 --> 13:48.018
Hey, Mom! Look!

13:48.219 --> 13:49.913
Two more bites, baby. Please?

13:50.120 --> 13:51.486
Then you're done.

13:53.024 --> 13:55.993
- Hi, Rachel.
- Hey, Dad, look!

13:56.427 --> 13:57.860
Oh, look!

13:58.062 --> 14:00.395
Grilled cheese sandwich
for breakfast.

14:01.499 --> 14:04.195
I gave in. What can I say?

14:04.402 --> 14:05.699
You're late.

14:05.903 --> 14:08.566
Sorry, we had a big one.
A building collapsed.

14:08.774 --> 14:10.833
Mommy's reading about tarts.

14:11.309 --> 14:12.833
Torts.

14:14.313 --> 14:15.610
Are you getting any sleep?

14:15.814 --> 14:17.337
Yeah, yeah. I'm okay.

14:19.017 --> 14:21.417
- You look tired.
- Yeah, Dad. You look tired.

14:21.620 --> 14:22.882
Oh, I do, do I?

14:23.956 --> 14:25.890
Are you gonna finish that?

14:26.091 --> 14:27.615
You mind if I eat it?

14:30.362 --> 14:32.853
Dr. Harris' office called
to confirm your meeting.

14:33.298 --> 14:36.097
Oh, jeez! That was today.

14:36.903 --> 14:38.029
You can still go, right?

14:38.371 --> 14:40.202
Yeah, yeah. I guess.

14:40.473 --> 14:42.407
You're not gonna forget
or get too busy?

14:42.976 --> 14:44.068
I'll go.

14:49.382 --> 14:50.781
What's so funny?

14:50.984 --> 14:53.214
- You know you're gonna hate it.
- Maybe not.

14:53.419 --> 14:55.649
At least the patients
don't throw up on you.

14:55.822 --> 14:56.811
Who threw up?

14:57.757 --> 14:58.883
Who threw up?

14:59.092 --> 15:00.583
Nobody threw up.

15:03.130 --> 15:06.327
It's just that between your hours
and my studying...

15:06.534 --> 15:08.934
...I feel like we never see
each other.

15:10.805 --> 15:13.171
I'll go meet Harris today, okay?

15:16.677 --> 15:18.406
I just hope you like it.

15:20.848 --> 15:21.906
Look at this.

15:25.954 --> 15:28.387
It's the first tailored
white coat I've seen.

15:28.589 --> 15:30.353
- Isn't he lovely?
- Lovely.

15:31.025 --> 15:32.755
Think he knows anything?

15:32.961 --> 15:34.552
He knows how to dress.

15:35.729 --> 15:38.961
He's my student. I'll find out.

15:41.036 --> 15:42.230
- John Carter?
- Yes, sir.

15:42.437 --> 15:43.768
Peter Benton.

15:43.972 --> 15:45.599
- You the surgical student?
- Third year.

15:45.807 --> 15:49.471
We'll spend a lot of time together,
so let me show you around.

15:49.679 --> 15:53.012
The Admitting desk is where you
page someone or get a chart.

15:53.216 --> 15:55.343
Don't shake his hand.
He's afraid of disease.

15:55.551 --> 15:58.212
In the lab we do crits,
counts, spin-downs.

15:58.420 --> 16:03.324
Mark chemistries "stat" whether
you want it fast or not.

16:03.526 --> 16:08.122
The chem lab is 7022. The heme lab
is 6944. Memorize it.

16:08.698 --> 16:09.960
IVs are given to everybody.

16:10.166 --> 16:11.633
Use an angiocath and 16 needle.

16:11.834 --> 16:14.360
You need a large bore
to transfuse them.

16:14.571 --> 16:17.095
- Can you start an IV?
- Actually, no.

16:17.273 --> 16:18.262
Aren't you third year?

16:18.441 --> 16:21.206
All I've done are
dermatology and psychiatry.

16:21.411 --> 16:23.241
The well-dressed specialties, huh?

16:23.480 --> 16:27.143
You'll find surgeons try to
help people, not just bill them.

16:27.351 --> 16:30.445
Pull the skin tight so the veins
don't roll, and go in low.

16:30.654 --> 16:32.484
Once in, pull this out
and hook it here.

16:32.689 --> 16:36.181
This is Carol Hathaway, the head nurse.
John Carter.

16:36.360 --> 16:37.349
Terrific, isn't she?

16:37.561 --> 16:40.531
She dates an orthopod who used
to be a Big Ten tackle.

16:42.132 --> 16:43.724
You want to tape it.

16:43.935 --> 16:46.732
Moderate flow, two or three
drips per second.

16:46.937 --> 16:49.805
That's it. That's all
there is to it.

16:56.014 --> 16:59.177
All along here you have
the medical examining rooms.

16:59.384 --> 17:01.852
It's where the pill-pushers
kill their victims.

17:02.053 --> 17:03.611
But this...

17:04.821 --> 17:07.017
...this is the surgical room.

17:07.358 --> 17:09.519
This is where the real action is.

17:11.829 --> 17:15.162
We use this phone to
call the O.R., 6440.

17:15.366 --> 17:18.063
X-ray is around the corner.
They're idiots.

17:18.270 --> 17:19.861
They scare the patients.

17:20.070 --> 17:23.234
Whenever you can,
go with the patients to X-ray.

17:23.441 --> 17:26.411
Don't let them get scared.
Don't let them get hurt.

17:26.712 --> 17:29.146
Here's Dr. Morgenstern.
He's the head of ER.

17:29.348 --> 17:31.647
Watch out, he eats students for lunch.

17:31.850 --> 17:32.942
David Morgenstern.

17:33.152 --> 17:37.111
- When did that severed hand go up?
- A vascular took it up an hour ago.

17:37.324 --> 17:39.416
Dr. Benton is one of
our best residents.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.217
Learn everything you can from him.

17:41.895 --> 17:43.385
Except attitude.

17:44.130 --> 17:46.530
- He didn't mean that.
- Yes, he did!

17:47.399 --> 17:50.460
You'll sew people up here.
Do you know how to suture?

17:50.670 --> 17:53.002
Okay, I'll teach you.

17:53.206 --> 17:55.674
- Is there anyone to sew?
- How would I know?

17:55.875 --> 17:59.937
I love this great spirit of
camaraderie. Everyone wants to help.

18:00.147 --> 18:01.670
Here's the suture room.

18:03.283 --> 18:06.343
Good morning, I'm Dr. Benton.
This is Dr. Carter.

18:06.553 --> 18:08.181
Let's have a look.

18:09.623 --> 18:12.558
- How'd you do this?
- Broke one of the breakfast dishes.

18:12.760 --> 18:16.820
Don't worry. We'll have you
fixed up right away.

18:17.631 --> 18:19.997
- Now, can you feel this?
- Yes!

18:20.201 --> 18:22.795
- Can you move your finger?
- It's just a cut!

18:23.004 --> 18:26.269
We have a policeman coming in
with a gunshot wound.

18:26.474 --> 18:29.238
Put him in Room 2, notify X-ray.
I'll be right there.

18:29.444 --> 18:31.343
Now, here's all your stuff.

18:31.579 --> 18:34.481
Ask if she's allergic
to locals or any drugs.

18:34.682 --> 18:38.619
This is lidocaine, but call it
Novocaine. They've heard of that.

18:39.453 --> 18:40.784
Any allergy to Novocaine?

18:40.989 --> 18:42.183
My teeth are okay.

18:42.391 --> 18:45.952
- No reactions, rashes, anything?
- No, of course not.

18:46.161 --> 18:48.629
You inject both sides of the wound.

18:48.830 --> 18:52.789
You have to put on surgical gloves.
You know how to do that?

18:54.470 --> 18:56.700
Great. Here we go.

19:00.243 --> 19:01.574
Here you go, Dr. Ross.

19:01.778 --> 19:03.244
Thank you, Nance.

19:04.346 --> 19:05.336
Dr. Ross.

19:05.848 --> 19:08.146
Tracy Young.
I'm your third- year student.

19:08.351 --> 19:10.319
Hello, Tracy Young.
Nice to meet you.

19:10.520 --> 19:13.045
We'll be working
very closely together...

19:13.256 --> 19:16.089
Not that closely, but
I'll do my best to help you.

19:16.292 --> 19:19.056
- I'd like to get started.
- Just being friendly.

19:19.729 --> 19:22.027
I've got all the friends
I need, thanks.

19:22.231 --> 19:23.357
Shall we get started?

19:29.372 --> 19:31.000
Evert the edges and space them...

19:31.208 --> 19:33.403
...because the tissues will be swelling.

19:33.610 --> 19:34.941
Space them this way.

19:35.144 --> 19:36.476
The policeman's here.

19:36.680 --> 19:39.649
Okay, I'm coming. Here, you finish.

19:50.928 --> 19:53.362
Okay, this isn't going to hurt at all.

19:58.336 --> 19:59.928
Now, what happened, Billy?

20:00.137 --> 20:02.902
The school sent him home.
They said he vomited blood.

20:04.209 --> 20:05.699
Can you tell me what happened?

20:05.909 --> 20:09.744
He's a very high-strung child.
Always very tense, very nervous.

20:09.948 --> 20:12.884
Maybe you better wait outside
while I examine your son.

20:13.051 --> 20:14.041
It's procedure.

20:14.219 --> 20:17.052
I should be here!
I'm worried about Billy. He needs me.

20:17.255 --> 20:18.655
Please wait outside.

20:18.858 --> 20:21.417
Look, doctor, this is my son...

20:21.626 --> 20:24.357
...and I want to be here.
He's very high- strung!

20:24.563 --> 20:26.827
You're absolutely right.
You love your son.

20:27.099 --> 20:28.999
You want him treated immediately.

20:29.667 --> 20:31.533
So it's best...

20:31.871 --> 20:35.898
...if you have a seat outside here.
And we'll be right with you.

20:44.651 --> 20:47.585
Hey, kiddo. All right.

20:47.820 --> 20:48.844
Did you vomit blood?

20:50.824 --> 20:52.415
Do you have any pain?

20:53.093 --> 20:55.152
Okay, can you point to the pain?

20:57.097 --> 20:58.291
Right in here.

20:58.899 --> 21:00.924
Have you vomited blood before?

21:01.134 --> 21:02.294
Many times?

21:10.711 --> 21:13.838
First eight-year-old
ulcer patient I've seen.

21:18.552 --> 21:21.044
You still here?
You doing a Sistine Chapel?

21:21.255 --> 21:24.713
Finish her up, start an IV
in Room 2. Bye, ma'am.

21:25.193 --> 21:27.024
Nurse, could you bandage this?

21:27.929 --> 21:30.557
- Thank you, doctor.
- You're very welcome.

21:30.765 --> 21:32.233
When do I get my stitches out?

21:33.734 --> 21:34.793
Three weeks.

21:35.102 --> 21:37.866
When my son had stitches
they said ten days.

21:38.073 --> 21:41.873
Really? Ten days, three weeks.
Any time in there.

21:48.717 --> 21:51.652
<i>We need an anesthesiologist to ICU.</i>

21:51.920 --> 21:53.751
<i>Please report to the ICU, stat.</i>

21:54.890 --> 21:57.882
250 mg Rocephin I.M. For the
man in Room 4...

21:58.093 --> 22:00.756
...and remind him to come back
in two days.

22:01.898 --> 22:03.797
Carol, are we out of oral
ampicillin?

22:04.000 --> 22:05.592
We ordered some yesterday.

22:05.801 --> 22:08.828
- Dr. Greene wants more Lasix.
- We were out an hour ago.

22:09.038 --> 22:11.438
Dr. Ross wants some PKU cards.

22:11.640 --> 22:14.235
No. He'll have to get
a blue-top from the baby.

22:14.444 --> 22:15.536
He says he can't.

22:17.180 --> 22:21.276
Are you sure that you don't have
a PKU card tucked away in...

22:21.484 --> 22:23.611
...that special stash of yours?

22:26.055 --> 22:27.750
Like this?

22:28.058 --> 22:32.357
I can always count on you.
Even if you do prefer football players.

22:32.563 --> 22:34.325
You had your chance.

22:34.530 --> 22:36.555
I was young. I was a fool!

22:37.301 --> 22:38.290
You're still a fool.

22:38.736 --> 22:40.966
What's the worst
paying medical specialty?

22:42.306 --> 22:45.298
- Pediatrics?
- You were right the first time.

22:49.346 --> 22:53.783
Carol, did that Lasix come up yet?
Because we need it now!

23:08.466 --> 23:12.129
Good morning. I'm Dr. Carter.
What seems to be the problem?

23:12.537 --> 23:16.132
What's it look like?
I shot myself in the freaking leg.

23:19.511 --> 23:22.071
- We'll fix you up.
- You guys keep saying that.

23:22.280 --> 23:24.943
But first, we have to start
a little IV.

23:25.151 --> 23:26.982
Just hurry it up, okay?

23:27.186 --> 23:28.448
Yes, sir.

23:31.424 --> 23:33.358
Oh, excuse me. Sorry.

23:38.331 --> 23:41.027
I wanted to belt her in the mouth.
I really did.

23:42.468 --> 23:44.766
Then I go and shoot myself in the leg.

23:45.038 --> 23:46.095
These things happen.

23:46.306 --> 23:49.707
I bet you see a lot
working in a place like this.

23:50.276 --> 23:51.834
Oh, yeah. All the time.

24:04.558 --> 24:07.686
You don't mind my asking,
have you done this before?

24:07.961 --> 24:10.192
I'd hate to tell you how often
I've done this.

24:11.665 --> 24:12.689
You'll feel a needle.

24:15.669 --> 24:17.035
Come on, it wasn't that bad.

24:18.272 --> 24:20.000
But we missed the vein.

24:20.408 --> 24:22.740
We have to try this one more time.

24:23.644 --> 24:26.135
My wife's not that bad.
We don't argue that much.

24:26.347 --> 24:29.213
Once in a while. In this case
it's lucky I didn't kill her.

24:29.417 --> 24:30.611
Oh, man!

24:31.452 --> 24:32.817
I'm afraid we missed again.

24:33.621 --> 24:34.883
We'll try one more time.

24:35.757 --> 24:38.556
You have very tough veins.

24:39.293 --> 24:40.761
My wife...

24:40.963 --> 24:43.022
...is a very beautiful woman.

24:44.066 --> 24:48.263
I'm not proud of beating up any woman.
Even when she's asking for it.

24:48.469 --> 24:52.031
I mean in this case, it's lucky
I didn't break her neck!

24:52.241 --> 24:53.572
I got it. Don't move.

24:54.410 --> 24:55.536
Don't move!

24:55.744 --> 24:57.871
It's in the vein. Do not move at all.

25:01.151 --> 25:04.017
There you go, officer.
You got yourself an IV!

25:04.486 --> 25:06.078
Everything's gonna be fine now.

25:06.956 --> 25:08.116
Can I move?

25:08.457 --> 25:09.856
Sure, move around.
You're fine.

25:10.959 --> 25:12.928
That's all I can do for the moment.

25:13.128 --> 25:15.859
They'll take you to X-ray,
then to surgery.

25:16.799 --> 25:20.201
- Surgery?
- But believe me...

25:20.737 --> 25:21.965
...the worst is over.

25:23.072 --> 25:24.437
This happened when you woke up?

25:24.641 --> 25:26.438
Yes, when I got out of bed.

25:26.643 --> 25:28.475
- Are you still seeing double now?
- No.

25:28.678 --> 25:30.738
- How many fingers?
- Three.

25:30.947 --> 25:33.415
- Have you had eye trouble before?
- No, never.

25:33.616 --> 25:35.380
Did you have pain while
seeing double?

25:35.586 --> 25:37.486
Headache?
Trouble with your balance?

25:37.688 --> 25:40.451
Funny taste in your mouth?
Flashing spots?

25:40.657 --> 25:45.061
- Weakness in limbs?
- No, none of those things. Never.

25:45.261 --> 25:47.856
I can call a neurologist
to go over you...

25:48.065 --> 25:49.895
...but that'll cost you $200.

25:50.100 --> 25:52.898
If you don't have any symptoms now,
I'd leave it alone.

25:53.405 --> 25:54.996
Come back if you have
more trouble.

25:56.006 --> 25:59.373
- Who's next?
- You're just saying that because I'm black.

25:59.577 --> 26:02.341
Trying to save you money,
I know you don't have insurance.

26:02.747 --> 26:05.215
You wouldn't say this
if I wasn't black.

26:05.416 --> 26:07.044
You're Jewish, right?

26:07.918 --> 26:12.754
Call a neuro consult for Mr. Ervin,
cc transient diplopia, and bill him.

26:24.336 --> 26:25.769
Hello, somebody! Hello!

26:25.971 --> 26:29.168
- What is it?
- I got a lady pregnant in my cab outside.

26:29.407 --> 26:31.273
Why'd you do that?

26:31.810 --> 26:32.902
We don't deliver here.

26:33.112 --> 26:35.306
You have to take her up to OB.

26:35.515 --> 26:38.211
She's having a baby whether you
deliver it or not.

26:39.652 --> 26:42.450
Hey, you busy?
Why don't you come with me?

26:43.523 --> 26:45.218
Get us an OB nurse.

26:46.760 --> 26:50.661
Okay, okay, ma'am.
Come on. Let's go. Let's get out.

26:50.863 --> 26:53.229
- You'll be fine.
- When did it start snowing?

26:54.033 --> 26:56.229
Come on, doctor, give me a hand!

26:56.435 --> 26:58.461
Up on the gurney, there you go.

26:58.671 --> 27:00.572
Is this your first child?

27:02.341 --> 27:04.435
Okay, let's go.

27:07.548 --> 27:09.140
It's starting, it's coming!

27:09.783 --> 27:12.479
Hold the head in. We don't
want her to deliver here.

27:12.686 --> 27:15.314
Put your hand between her legs
and hold the head in.

27:15.889 --> 27:18.016
Breathe, ma'am.
Blow through the pain.

27:18.225 --> 27:22.060
Get me Anesthesia, call the
pediatrician. Hook up those stirrups.

27:22.263 --> 27:23.627
You doing an episiotomy?

27:23.830 --> 27:25.957
I don't have time.
She's already crowning.

27:26.166 --> 27:28.829
Blow through the pain, ma'am.
Blow through the pain.

27:29.037 --> 27:30.765
Blow through the pain.
That's right.

27:30.972 --> 27:33.338
- What should I do?
- Just what you're doing.

27:33.541 --> 27:35.099
Is it snowing out there?

27:35.944 --> 27:38.572
When I'm done scrubbing,
I'll take over while you scrub.

27:39.213 --> 27:41.341
- Where's the OB resident?
- They're on call.

27:41.549 --> 27:42.743
You want a gown?

27:42.951 --> 27:44.179
I don't think I have time.

27:44.385 --> 27:47.116
I'm gonna have to catch this one
anyway I can.

27:47.322 --> 27:50.451
No kidding? All right, dear.
You'll be just fine.

27:50.659 --> 27:53.059
You just have to blow, okay? Blow.

27:53.261 --> 27:54.957
- Is it snowing?
- Yeah, it's snowing.

27:55.164 --> 27:57.689
Snowing on March 17th.
This is unbelievable.

27:57.900 --> 28:00.892
It's okay, ma'am.
You're going to be just fine.

28:01.337 --> 28:04.101
Let me take over. There we go.

28:04.306 --> 28:07.639
Ma'am, we're gonna push on
the next one, okay?

28:09.411 --> 28:12.176
One, two, three...

28:15.352 --> 28:17.080
One more. This is the one.

28:17.286 --> 28:20.279
And, push, push, push...

28:22.058 --> 28:23.252
One more push.

28:23.460 --> 28:24.825
We're gonna get him out.

28:25.028 --> 28:28.225
One, two, three, push.
Good!

28:28.431 --> 28:30.661
Shoulders are clear.

28:33.737 --> 28:35.967
You have a beautiful little boy.

28:37.041 --> 28:38.439
Clamp.

28:40.910 --> 28:42.138
There you go.

28:57.795 --> 28:59.092
He's a cutie-pie.

28:59.296 --> 29:00.696
You did a good job there.

29:10.474 --> 29:13.171
Dr. Carter. You have 3 sutures
waiting for you.

29:13.378 --> 29:16.575
You're not on medical services.
They don't need your help.

29:16.782 --> 29:18.147
Come on, let's get cracking.

29:33.331 --> 29:35.129
Patient: Martin, Jonathan.

29:35.333 --> 29:38.394
Anterior and lateral
right lower extremity.

29:38.604 --> 29:40.595
Femur articulation...

29:40.807 --> 29:44.436
...patella, tibia, fibula
all appear normal.

29:44.644 --> 29:47.272
There's a radiolucent density
in the soft tissue...

29:47.480 --> 29:49.471
...superficial to the fibula.

29:49.682 --> 29:51.843
A bullet is what it's called, Steve.

29:52.051 --> 29:55.418
There is no apparent fragmentation of
the foreign body.

29:55.621 --> 29:57.487
Distal tibia and fibula
all appear...

29:57.691 --> 29:59.886
- Come on, Steve!
...within normal limits.

30:00.094 --> 30:03.291
Impression: Foreign body in
the right lower extremity...

30:03.497 --> 30:06.260
...consistent with possible bullet.

30:07.134 --> 30:10.035
Is that it? Thank you.

30:10.504 --> 30:11.698
I'll take these.

30:11.905 --> 30:16.069
There's a guy with a bullet in
his leg who'd like to have it out.

30:20.748 --> 30:24.206
Sure you're not feeling any pain?
No pain here in your back?

30:24.719 --> 30:25.845
You know what?

30:26.054 --> 30:28.454
All you've got is
a fracture to your ankle.

30:28.655 --> 30:30.453
Everything else is fine.

30:30.658 --> 30:34.185
Now, what's the story, doc?
Do I get worker's comp?

30:34.429 --> 30:35.793
The story?

30:36.698 --> 30:38.529
The story is, you're still alive.

30:38.733 --> 30:40.792
Great, but I got a few bills and...

30:44.639 --> 30:47.164
There it is, nice and red.

30:47.510 --> 30:50.000
He has Otitis media.
He'll be fine.

30:50.913 --> 30:53.506
250 milligrams of oral amoxicillan.

30:53.715 --> 30:56.013
If he's not better tomorrow,
call me.

30:56.217 --> 30:58.152
All right? It was nice to see you.

30:58.353 --> 30:59.878
Bye, tiger.

31:01.223 --> 31:03.851
- He's very handsome.
- He knows it.

31:04.192 --> 31:07.959
We got a UA and a sed rate
for patient Rebecca Morton.

31:08.164 --> 31:09.825
M-O-R...

31:10.032 --> 31:12.331
What do you mean?
We sent this an hour ago!

31:12.535 --> 31:15.231
It's 1:40 and it was a stat
determination.

31:15.437 --> 31:17.405
What're you doing,
picking your noses?

31:17.606 --> 31:19.575
Chest pains two hours, question AMI.

31:19.775 --> 31:21.869
I will talk to you
any damn way I want to.

31:22.077 --> 31:23.544
If I sent for a stat chem...

31:23.747 --> 31:26.614
...I want it in an hour,
not sometime next month.

31:27.150 --> 31:29.744
Well, we're a little busy here too.

31:30.452 --> 31:34.014
When they start going to lunch
things will really slow down.

31:35.592 --> 31:38.322
- What do you want me to do?
- Go to lunch.

31:38.628 --> 31:40.493
I'm okay, if there's
something to do.

31:41.031 --> 31:42.521
Excuse me a minute.

31:48.071 --> 31:49.198
Don't be a hero.

31:49.406 --> 31:51.136
If I tell you to go to lunch, go.

31:51.342 --> 31:54.573
It's a long time before dinner,
and you may be too busy to eat.

31:54.779 --> 31:58.180
You never know how long till
your next meal, so eat when you can.

31:58.382 --> 32:02.011
Get the hell out of here.
And don't take more than half an hour.

32:13.699 --> 32:16.361
I'm Dr. Greene.
What's the trouble, Mrs. O'Rourke?

32:16.567 --> 32:18.263
I'm not Mrs. O'Rourke.

32:20.338 --> 32:21.532
Mrs. O'Rourke!

32:22.140 --> 32:24.608
Is there a Mrs. O'Rourke here?

32:36.422 --> 32:37.719
- Tyrone!
- What is it?

32:37.923 --> 32:39.515
Crack dealer. Took 5 shots.

32:39.726 --> 32:40.988
We need muscle in here!

32:41.194 --> 32:43.162
- He's just a kid.
- Thirteen.

32:43.363 --> 32:44.694
- Call security!
- Why?

32:44.898 --> 32:48.197
The other gang members
may come and finish him off.

32:52.505 --> 32:54.166
Let's keep it calm.
Here we go.

32:54.374 --> 32:58.435
This is Tracy Young in ER.
I need someone in Trauma Room 1.

33:04.584 --> 33:06.609
Surgical 2. Turn right and down.

33:06.819 --> 33:08.946
We have a motorcycle accident coming.

33:09.155 --> 33:11.453
- Wasn't wearing a helmet.
- Those are stat labs.

33:11.659 --> 33:15.254
I'll be across the street. Told
my wife I'd keep this appointment.

33:15.462 --> 33:16.690
Can Susan cover for me?

33:17.865 --> 33:18.923
No, not there!

33:19.133 --> 33:21.033
Surgical 2!

34:06.015 --> 34:08.175
I'm Dr. Greene to see Dr. Harris.

34:13.121 --> 34:15.181
<i>Everyone has a family, Mark.</i>

34:15.391 --> 34:18.326
My wife wants to shop. Kids grow up.

34:18.527 --> 34:22.089
You want private school, college.
You gotta think about that.

34:22.732 --> 34:27.032
Now, the office for our
next associate is here.

34:29.139 --> 34:33.303
As a junior man, you'll do all calls
and weekends for a year or so.

34:33.510 --> 34:34.498
Compensation...

34:34.678 --> 34:39.047
...you'll start out at 120,000 per year,
plus bonuses.

34:39.882 --> 34:43.944
The group has a condo in Jamaica
and one in Aspen. Do you ski?

34:44.154 --> 34:45.451
Haven't had the opportunity.

34:45.655 --> 34:48.022
You should. It's a great sport.

34:48.226 --> 34:52.925
Morgenstern tells me that you're
the sharpest guy ER ever had.

34:53.130 --> 34:56.259
But I'll tell you,
the ER is a young man's game.

34:56.467 --> 34:59.299
You think you're doing good,
but there's a lot to life...

34:59.504 --> 35:01.096
...especially this one.

35:01.305 --> 35:03.864
We find the practice
intellectually challenging...

35:04.075 --> 35:06.703
...so we send our physicians
to major conferences.

35:06.911 --> 35:10.746
Last year: Maui, Paris, Rome.

35:11.950 --> 35:16.785
We're proud to practice the best
possible medicine we can here.

35:17.890 --> 35:20.051
- Seems great.
- You like this?

35:20.259 --> 35:22.227
We had Prescott redesign it.

35:22.428 --> 35:26.091
We redesign every couple of years.
Keeps us looking fresh.

35:26.799 --> 35:27.788
Terrific.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.899
Do we have time for lunch?

35:30.102 --> 35:33.265
We'll go to the Crown Club.
They have a great porcini pasta.

35:33.472 --> 35:35.167
- I gotta get back.
- No oil!

35:36.542 --> 35:39.239
Melissa would you bring
Dr. Greene's coat?

35:39.445 --> 35:40.742
Maybe next week?

35:42.381 --> 35:44.782
- We'd love to have you.
- Thank you.

35:46.985 --> 35:49.784
Mrs. McCormick, how are you?

35:49.989 --> 35:54.323
I thought the Field Museum Ball
was wonderful!

35:54.860 --> 35:57.352
Margo loved the flower arrangements.

36:08.876 --> 36:10.843
Cheer up, doctor, it's only 3:00.

36:11.045 --> 36:13.343
Three o'clock.
I must be crazy, huh?

36:13.547 --> 36:15.377
That's a very good insight.

36:27.261 --> 36:28.626
When did it start raining?

36:36.637 --> 36:38.036
It's raining!

36:38.240 --> 36:40.230
It has been for an hour.

36:41.108 --> 36:43.770
- How's your new student?
- Very capable.

36:43.979 --> 36:45.310
Tough.

36:46.848 --> 36:49.874
So I hear you went up to
Harris' today.

36:50.085 --> 36:51.518
Did he offer you a job?

36:51.719 --> 36:55.157
Yeah. I think I have to go to
a lot of charity balls.

36:55.357 --> 36:57.154
There are worse things.

36:57.359 --> 36:58.917
I guess.

36:59.127 --> 37:00.458
Must be.

37:00.930 --> 37:04.331
What's this I hear about you
and that tech up on Surgical 4?

37:04.534 --> 37:06.525
- I'm a married man.
- So?

37:06.736 --> 37:09.795
- So whatever you heard is not true.
- All right.

37:10.006 --> 37:12.064
I heard that she was seriously cute.

37:12.275 --> 37:15.904
But you are faithful to your wife.
Is that what you're telling me?

37:17.246 --> 37:19.874
Why would you do something like that?

37:20.082 --> 37:22.449
Because I'm too tired
to do anything else.

37:28.658 --> 37:32.059
We'll know more when we have
the x-rays. How much do you smoke?

37:33.163 --> 37:35.131
Two, three packs a day sometimes.

37:35.332 --> 37:37.664
And how long have you been
doing this?

37:38.402 --> 37:40.369
Since I was about 14, I guess.

37:40.571 --> 37:43.131
- You really should stop that.
- I know.

37:43.807 --> 37:46.571
Excuse me.
You can put your clothes back on.

37:55.118 --> 37:58.246
Listen, I can't talk at work
unless it's... It is?

37:58.455 --> 38:01.084
Well, what...?

38:01.292 --> 38:04.455
No, I'm on all night.

38:04.662 --> 38:08.359
I get off tomorrow night at six.

38:08.566 --> 38:11.000
Paul, I thought we broke up.

38:11.669 --> 38:13.728
Oh, Paul, come on.

38:16.140 --> 38:17.903
Damn!

38:18.110 --> 38:22.945
What? No, not you. It's just,
I have to tell a patient something.

38:23.147 --> 38:27.517
Listen, is everything all right?
I'm sorry, but I just...

38:27.720 --> 38:30.985
Yeah. Okay, bye.

38:35.127 --> 38:37.391
We have your x-rays, Mr. Parker.

38:40.199 --> 38:43.464
You can see there's a density
in the right middle lobe.

38:44.003 --> 38:45.301
What does that mean?

38:45.505 --> 38:48.632
Something abnormal within
the structure of your lung.

38:48.842 --> 38:50.706
- In my lung?
- That's right.

38:53.178 --> 38:55.203
- What is it?
- It could be...

38:55.414 --> 38:59.146
...an infiltrate, a dense area
of tissue from an old infection.

38:59.352 --> 39:00.944
Perhaps an inhaled foreign body.

39:01.154 --> 39:04.554
It could be a granuloma.
It could be a lot of things.

39:07.594 --> 39:10.119
- What do you think it is?
- There's no way to know.

39:10.331 --> 39:12.799
You'll need
a bronchoscopy and possibly...

39:12.999 --> 39:14.557
...exploratory surgery.

39:15.302 --> 39:17.998
I understand, but what do you
think in the meantime?

39:18.572 --> 39:21.335
You should consider it
potentially serious.

39:26.480 --> 39:27.469
So I got cancer.

39:27.682 --> 39:31.413
I'm not saying that.
We don't know anything for sure.

39:31.619 --> 39:33.484
Let me explain something to you.

39:33.688 --> 39:35.849
I'm 40. I have a wife
and 3 children...

39:36.057 --> 39:37.388
...a house not paid for...

39:37.592 --> 39:39.753
...and a mother whose house
isn't paid for.

39:39.961 --> 39:41.223
I have responsibilities.

39:41.429 --> 39:44.193
So I need to know.
I need to know what you think.

39:44.399 --> 39:47.732
You should regard your condition
as very serious...

39:47.936 --> 39:49.698
...but await a final determination.

39:49.904 --> 39:51.805
I don't understand the problem.

39:52.274 --> 39:54.242
Are you afraid to tell me the truth?

39:57.546 --> 40:01.004
Your history of coughing blood,
weight loss...

40:01.650 --> 40:04.950
...and this x-ray
is suggestive of cancer.

40:05.153 --> 40:09.318
But the diagnosis is not confirmed,
and it may be something else.

40:09.525 --> 40:12.652
And we shouldn't jump to any
conclusions until we know.

40:12.862 --> 40:14.022
That's what I think.

40:19.869 --> 40:21.359
How long do I have?

40:29.612 --> 40:30.944
Six months to a year.

40:41.392 --> 40:42.950
Do I have six months for sure?

40:44.161 --> 40:46.129
No, not for sure.

40:52.703 --> 40:56.469
I was wondering because I always
wanted to take my wife to Nassau.

40:56.774 --> 40:59.243
We talked about it,
but we never did it.

40:59.444 --> 41:04.380
I just figured, spring's coming,
it's getting too late to go to Nassau.

41:04.581 --> 41:08.746
She always wanted a suntan in the
winter to show off to the neighbors.

41:09.319 --> 41:10.308
I understand.

41:14.859 --> 41:16.520
So I guess I'd better go.

41:16.728 --> 41:20.630
Summer will be here before you know it,
so I better go soon, huh?

41:21.366 --> 41:23.096
Doctor, I want to thank you.

41:23.902 --> 41:27.999
I want to thank you for your help
and for being straight with me.

41:31.943 --> 41:34.104
I guess I don't have to quit smoking.

41:54.968 --> 41:58.768
Mr. Parker, if there's one thing
you learn in my job...

41:58.971 --> 42:00.997
...it's that nothing is certain.

42:01.675 --> 42:05.304
Nothing that seems very bad
and nothing that seems very good.

42:05.979 --> 42:08.106
Nothing is certain.

42:08.715 --> 42:09.841
Nothing.

42:32.172 --> 42:33.538
I'm sorry.

42:57.633 --> 42:58.861
Good evening.

42:59.067 --> 43:01.228
How's it going tonight, Mrs. Raskin?

43:01.436 --> 43:05.167
Timmy, I have a problem
that requires medical attention.

43:05.374 --> 43:08.207
See Dr. Greene.
He's on duty tonight.

43:09.478 --> 43:11.037
Dr. Greene!

43:11.247 --> 43:12.770
How nice!

43:14.249 --> 43:15.979
- Good evening.
- How you doing?

43:16.184 --> 43:18.244
He says he doesn't drink. Then...

43:18.453 --> 43:22.184
I require medical attention,
Dr. Greene.

43:22.425 --> 43:24.290
Give me a minute, Chris.

43:24.493 --> 43:25.551
Yes, Mrs. Raskin?

43:25.762 --> 43:29.289
I have this troublesome...

43:29.465 --> 43:30.454
...hangnail.

43:30.667 --> 43:33.261
- Mrs. Raskin.
- I'm afraid it may be infected.

43:33.469 --> 43:37.371
If we treat you, it's gonna
cost you $ 180. You do know that?

43:37.574 --> 43:39.064
I wish you'd do it for me.

43:39.376 --> 43:41.571
You're such a nice young doctor...

43:41.779 --> 43:44.976
...and I do appreciate
your taking the time.

43:49.419 --> 43:51.047
We'll handle this in the lab.

43:51.255 --> 43:54.224
The lab? Oh, gracious!

43:55.359 --> 43:57.884
I had no idea how complicated it was!

43:58.095 --> 44:00.188
I'll be excising
Mrs. Raskin's hangnail.

44:00.364 --> 44:01.422
I'll stand back.

44:01.599 --> 44:03.897
Well, at my age,
you can't be too careful.

44:04.101 --> 44:06.433
Please have a seat, Mrs. Raskin.

44:06.671 --> 44:08.161
Thank you.

44:09.307 --> 44:13.208
Dr. Greene, you look tired.
How have you been?

44:13.411 --> 44:14.537
Fine, thanks.

44:14.746 --> 44:18.614
And your wife? Is she still
studying for her bar exam?

44:18.817 --> 44:21.786
Next month.
We won't see much of each other.

44:21.987 --> 44:23.454
This alcohol may feel cold.

44:23.755 --> 44:27.191
- Mark, you got time for coffee?
- In half an hour.

44:29.495 --> 44:32.554
She's very cute.
She work here at the hospital?

44:32.765 --> 44:33.959
She's a resident.

44:35.600 --> 44:38.764
Did I tell you
my sister got remarried?

44:39.772 --> 44:42.297
How long has it been
since I've seen you?

44:43.142 --> 44:45.406
Just a week or so.

44:46.379 --> 44:48.870
- Here we go.
- Oh, don't make such a fuss!

44:51.083 --> 44:53.177
Thank you, Dr. Greene.

44:55.054 --> 44:57.147
Now, you be a good boy...

44:57.590 --> 45:00.025
...and go home to your wife.

45:03.930 --> 45:06.591
- Another day, another dollar.
- Good night, Timmy.

45:06.800 --> 45:08.199
- See you.
- Good night.

45:08.402 --> 45:09.699
Hey, Red.

45:10.203 --> 45:11.898
- Hey, Tim.
- How you doing?

45:12.105 --> 45:13.970
- I'm good.
- Yeah? Good.

45:14.174 --> 45:15.402
Ready to work.

45:17.878 --> 45:19.709
- Can you get some...
- Sorry, I'm off.

45:19.913 --> 45:21.506
- I forgot. See you.
- Good night.

45:21.716 --> 45:25.947
In 3, the lady with pulmonary edema
gets Lasix and a nitroglycerin drip.

45:26.154 --> 45:29.350
In 4, there's some kid.
Dr. Ross is looking after him.

45:29.557 --> 45:33.391
Five, there's a question pulmonary
embolism. Labs are coming.

45:33.660 --> 45:35.151
I need 2 grams chloramphenicol.

45:35.363 --> 45:38.264
You're gonna have to get it
from the next shift.

45:41.736 --> 45:43.499
- See you tomorrow.
- Good night.

45:43.705 --> 45:45.195
Malik needs chloramphenicol.

45:45.407 --> 45:47.169
- Coming right up.
- All right.

45:49.043 --> 45:50.908
- Good night.
- See you.

45:51.113 --> 45:52.807
See you guys tomorrow.

46:07.196 --> 46:10.632
Come on, it's not that bad.
It's a very minor cut.

46:10.833 --> 46:14.098
- Three stitches.
- It's not the cut!

46:14.303 --> 46:16.135
It's the car.

46:16.572 --> 46:18.938
I smashed the car.

46:21.510 --> 46:25.504
I wasn't supposed to drive it,
and I took the keys...

46:25.715 --> 46:27.945
...and I smashed it up.

46:28.417 --> 46:30.818
And it was brand-new!

46:31.020 --> 46:34.148
My father loves that car.

46:35.158 --> 46:38.389
Well, it might not be
as bad as you think.

46:40.730 --> 46:43.325
It was a brand-new Cadillac...

46:44.234 --> 46:46.566
...with power steering...

46:46.871 --> 46:48.998
...and air conditioning.

46:50.040 --> 46:52.531
Oh, God! He'll kill me.

46:52.743 --> 46:56.644
It was the first new car he ever had!

47:06.057 --> 47:07.217
Suzanne.

47:10.194 --> 47:12.389
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, Daddy.

47:14.965 --> 47:16.627
Could we not move, please?

47:18.135 --> 47:21.162
- Is she gonna be all right?
- She's gonna be fine.

47:22.407 --> 47:23.874
Oh, honey.

47:25.343 --> 47:26.367
Daddy...

47:26.578 --> 47:28.739
...I trashed the car.

47:30.015 --> 47:31.482
It's all right.

47:31.683 --> 47:34.174
The important thing is
that you're okay.

47:38.290 --> 47:39.723
What car?

47:43.496 --> 47:44.484
The Caddy?

47:45.564 --> 47:46.930
Daddy, I'm so sorry.

47:47.133 --> 47:49.499
You totaled my new Seville?

47:57.777 --> 47:59.836
My new Cadillac!

48:18.832 --> 48:19.958
It doesn't matter.

48:23.437 --> 48:24.426
It doesn't matter.

48:27.274 --> 48:29.265
You have 6 in backup.
That's not good.

48:29.476 --> 48:31.967
The worst is yet to come.
Let's move, huh?

48:37.218 --> 48:38.775
Who was that idiot?

48:40.321 --> 48:41.345
Why'd he do it?

48:41.556 --> 48:43.786
I don't know.
He just swallowed it.

48:43.992 --> 48:46.119
- Jimmy, why'd you do it?
- Because.

48:46.327 --> 48:47.760
You see? He's impossible!

48:47.962 --> 48:49.657
Here's the KUB.

48:51.733 --> 48:53.291
There it is, all right.

48:54.502 --> 48:56.164
You mean it's in his stomach?

48:56.372 --> 48:58.499
- You said he swallowed it.
- What do I do?

48:58.707 --> 49:00.834
Check his stools.
He'll probably pass it.

49:01.043 --> 49:04.570
I mean, how do I get into my house?
I'm locked out.

49:06.615 --> 49:08.549
You don't have another key?

49:08.851 --> 49:11.251
- It's not funny.
- I'm sorry.

49:16.659 --> 49:19.959
It's possible to become pregnant
without actual penetration.

49:20.162 --> 49:23.097
- Just by fooling around.
- I'm not pregnant.

49:23.300 --> 49:25.928
It's important you tell me
why you think you may be.

49:26.101 --> 49:27.091
No reason.

49:27.636 --> 49:30.401
If you are, you might
have an ectopic pregnancy...

49:30.607 --> 49:32.871
...and you'd need
surgery right away.

49:33.176 --> 49:35.974
It's serious. It could be
a matter of life and death.

49:36.179 --> 49:37.407
I'm not pregnant.

49:40.583 --> 49:42.346
Excuse me for one second.

49:42.686 --> 49:44.483
- How old?
- She's 13.

49:44.688 --> 49:48.021
She's got pain in her lower left
side and she's not pregnant?

49:48.758 --> 49:50.556
Okay, let's see.

49:56.032 --> 49:59.230
Hello, Miss Murphy.
I'm Dr. Benton.

49:59.770 --> 50:02.102
How long has it been
since your last period?

50:03.474 --> 50:06.409
- I don't know.
- Just think back. Tell me roughly.

50:10.481 --> 50:11.641
It was after Christmas.

50:13.318 --> 50:15.376
So it's been a few months.

50:15.754 --> 50:17.779
I guess so.
I haven't paid attention.

50:19.890 --> 50:21.449
You've had sexual intercourse?

50:26.465 --> 50:27.454
Yes.

50:29.634 --> 50:30.623
Dr. Carter...

50:32.637 --> 50:34.298
...it's an ectopic pregnancy...

50:34.506 --> 50:38.442
...and she needs to be scheduled
for ultrasound and surgery right away.

50:47.052 --> 50:48.486
How'd it go?

50:48.688 --> 50:52.817
You know what Harris' office is like.
It's like a nightclub or something.

50:53.026 --> 50:55.152
- He offered you a job?
- Yeah.

50:55.628 --> 50:57.960
- But I don't know.
- You don't wanna do it.

50:58.164 --> 51:00.792
It doesn't seem
like real medicine to me.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.935
- So what's the problem?
- You know what the problem is.

51:04.137 --> 51:05.605
Jennifer?

51:07.808 --> 51:09.832
You can't live your life
for someone else.

51:10.044 --> 51:11.772
- I know.
- Especially a lawyer.

51:12.045 --> 51:15.208
- She's not a lawyer yet.
- It's gotta be your life.

51:15.415 --> 51:17.384
It is. It's just...

51:17.583 --> 51:20.348
She keeps talking about
how she doesn't see me anymore.

51:20.654 --> 51:23.350
Well, she probably never does.
I never see Paul.

51:23.556 --> 51:25.047
I thought you guys broke up.

51:25.259 --> 51:27.193
Well, we did. But...

51:27.828 --> 51:29.090
...you know.

51:29.297 --> 51:30.388
Yeah.

51:43.178 --> 51:45.042
Yeah, yeah. Right away.

51:45.713 --> 51:47.112
Come on, we gotta go.

51:47.314 --> 51:48.680
We gotta go.

51:48.883 --> 51:50.316
Mark, what?

52:04.834 --> 52:06.232
Did you hear?

52:06.869 --> 52:08.802
Yeah. She's on her way.

52:09.938 --> 52:11.372
It's incredible.

52:11.574 --> 52:14.941
I don't know how this happened...

52:15.578 --> 52:17.671
...to her, of all people.

52:20.449 --> 52:21.814
I don't know.

52:26.123 --> 52:28.523
Okay, people.
Let's break it up.

52:28.724 --> 52:31.249
There's lots to do.
Let's get back to work.

52:37.834 --> 52:39.961
Come on.
What do you expect to see?

52:43.573 --> 52:45.768
Hey, let's get back to work!

52:47.077 --> 52:49.705
Go in here. Head first.

52:54.251 --> 52:56.651
My God, it is Hathaway!

53:01.158 --> 53:04.128
All right, move her on three.
One, two, three.

53:05.863 --> 53:09.026
Let's get her clothes off.
Let's go, let's go!

53:17.309 --> 53:18.469
Let's go.

53:22.313 --> 53:23.780
Call Respiratory.

53:24.982 --> 53:25.971
What'd she take?

53:26.251 --> 53:29.652
I don't know.
She went into the medicine cabinet.

53:30.822 --> 53:32.517
You have no idea what she took?

53:34.091 --> 53:37.858
I want a drug screen, two milligrams
of Narcan and an amp of D50.

53:38.063 --> 53:39.758
- You wanna pump her?
- Yep.

53:45.137 --> 53:47.537
Marie, call Neuro.
Call the nursing supervisor.

53:47.739 --> 53:49.173
Did you call her family?

53:49.375 --> 53:51.366
I don't know her family.

53:51.578 --> 53:53.603
- Why'd she do it?
- It doesn't matter why.

53:53.813 --> 53:57.510
We don't ask that about other ODs
and we don't ask it about this one.

54:27.548 --> 54:29.482
I want blood gas and electrolytes.

54:30.184 --> 54:32.584
- How hypotensive is she?
- 80 over 60.

54:32.920 --> 54:35.481
- Did she have anything to drink?
- A Scotch.

54:35.689 --> 54:38.385
- More than one?
- I don't know. Maybe.

54:40.195 --> 54:42.094
What are you people
standing around for?

54:43.498 --> 54:46.262
Do the arterial stick.
She got a Babinski?

54:46.700 --> 54:47.689
Yeah, positive.

54:52.641 --> 54:55.542
- How's the oxygen?
- Fifteen liters and running.

55:07.922 --> 55:10.447
Morgenstern's on his way.
Her serum barb is 45.

55:11.259 --> 55:13.921
- Is that a mistake?
- Repeated twice.

55:19.001 --> 55:21.731
Close the curtain.
This isn't a show here, people.

55:36.519 --> 55:38.181
And what's the nature of the...

55:38.388 --> 55:39.786
I see.

55:40.990 --> 55:44.687
Call Dr. Benton. We got a shotgun
wound to the chest coming in.

55:46.029 --> 55:47.155
What a night!

55:47.364 --> 55:49.832
Gas distention, distal
to the duodenum is...

55:50.033 --> 55:51.261
Call the O.R.

55:51.468 --> 55:53.936
Impression: Acute small
bowel obstruction.

55:54.137 --> 55:56.037
This is a surgical candidate.

55:56.240 --> 56:00.175
Oh, you guys are incredible.
What would we do without you?

56:00.410 --> 56:05.178
It's nice to see you, Peter.
Man of many talents, all unproven.

56:10.121 --> 56:12.453
We get a new barbiturate level yet?

56:13.023 --> 56:14.651
It just came back.

56:14.859 --> 56:16.656
It's still 45.

56:20.398 --> 56:23.493
<i>Pupils: Mid-range and sluggish.
BP: 90 over 70.</i>

56:24.969 --> 56:28.803
We just got her barbiturate level.
It's 45 micrograms per milliliter.

56:29.241 --> 56:33.507
She's intubated and we're getting
her ready for hemoperfusion.

56:33.712 --> 56:36.680
But if she's decerebrating...
You know the question.

56:36.881 --> 56:39.680
Should we be trying
any of this at all?

56:39.885 --> 56:41.147
It doesn't look hopeful.

56:41.353 --> 56:44.345
But for the morale of the unit,
we gotta do everything.

56:44.556 --> 56:46.387
I mean, she was...

56:47.126 --> 56:48.218
...is...

56:48.794 --> 56:50.820
...very popular.

56:55.101 --> 56:59.060
The unit's looking to you, Mark.
You set the tone.

57:03.877 --> 57:06.539
She was one of us.
We loved her. We worked with her.

57:06.746 --> 57:08.441
Now something's happened to her.

57:08.647 --> 57:13.210
It makes us feel guilty and angry
and scares the hell out of us.

57:13.520 --> 57:17.581
But we take care of her,
and then we go on with our jobs.

57:20.727 --> 57:22.991
You set the tone, Mark.

57:23.664 --> 57:25.188
You get the unit through this.

57:26.434 --> 57:27.594
I'm fine.

57:30.504 --> 57:32.665
Call me if anything happens.

57:35.810 --> 57:37.334
Anything at all.

57:52.660 --> 57:55.255
- She really did it, didn't she?
- Yeah, she did.

57:55.497 --> 57:58.193
- She seemed okay today.
- Yeah, she seemed fine.

57:58.400 --> 58:00.265
She was making jokes.

58:00.702 --> 58:04.229
Everything was great. She was funny.
She was joking like always.

58:04.840 --> 58:06.398
She was great.

58:09.644 --> 58:11.635
Go get some coffee, Doug.

58:56.960 --> 58:58.951
Come on. Let's get him up.

58:59.162 --> 59:01.154
Alrighty. Good, good.

59:02.333 --> 59:05.301
A knife wound.
I thought it was a gunshot wound.

59:05.502 --> 59:07.164
Excuse me.
I feel a little...

59:07.371 --> 59:10.863
I didn't need you anyway.
Notify the O.R. Let's get a room.

59:11.074 --> 59:13.235
Move him out.
Here we go, buddy.

59:17.015 --> 59:18.880
Jerry, hold that?

59:37.503 --> 59:38.993
Feeling better?

59:41.739 --> 59:45.506
I'll be okay in a minute.
It just got to me all of a sudden.

59:46.444 --> 59:47.969
Keep your head down.

59:48.213 --> 59:50.613
There's no rush. Just relax.

59:51.483 --> 59:53.917
It stopped raining.

59:57.756 --> 59:59.781
I thought I was going to be sick.

01:00:01.026 --> 01:00:02.015
I'm sorry.

01:00:02.227 --> 01:00:04.093
Don't ever say you're sorry.

01:00:05.464 --> 01:00:06.989
There's two kinds of doctors.

01:00:08.134 --> 01:00:10.034
Those who get rid
of their feelings...

01:00:10.235 --> 01:00:12.329
...and those who keep them.

01:00:13.907 --> 01:00:17.001
If you're gonna keep your feelings,
you'll get sick sometimes.

01:00:17.211 --> 01:00:19.007
That's just how it works.

01:00:20.347 --> 01:00:22.247
Keep your head down.

01:00:28.021 --> 01:00:29.420
People come in here...

01:00:29.623 --> 01:00:34.083
...and they're sick, dying
and bleeding...

01:00:34.295 --> 01:00:36.228
...and they need our help.

01:00:37.765 --> 01:00:40.427
Helping them is
more important than how we feel.

01:00:44.772 --> 01:00:47.468
But it's still a pain
in the ass sometimes.

01:00:50.212 --> 01:00:54.545
Sometimes I just want to quit
and do something else.

01:01:05.527 --> 01:01:07.620
Why don't you take
a few more minutes.

01:01:08.764 --> 01:01:09.753
By the way...

01:01:10.832 --> 01:01:13.824
...I was in medical school
with Benton.

01:01:14.369 --> 01:01:17.635
He used to get sick all the time.

01:01:18.775 --> 01:01:20.800
So don't let him give you any crap.

01:01:22.844 --> 01:01:23.833
You'll be fine.

01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:42.825
<i>Steven Howard has played
behind Damon.</i>

01:01:43.032 --> 01:01:46.992
<i>He'll have to come out
and take that ball away from him...</i>

01:02:10.027 --> 01:02:11.426
What's the score?

01:02:12.362 --> 01:02:13.352
De Paul is down.

01:02:16.266 --> 01:02:17.255
You okay?

01:02:18.368 --> 01:02:19.358
Good.

01:02:20.905 --> 01:02:23.031
Don't worry about
what happened out there.

01:02:24.676 --> 01:02:26.769
Just don't make a habit of it.

01:02:48.367 --> 01:02:52.463
She's been on dialysis for three hours.
She's still comatose.

01:02:52.671 --> 01:02:55.765
She took short-acting agents.
She knew what she was doing.

01:02:55.975 --> 01:02:58.603
- Has the family been notified?
- I think so.

01:02:58.811 --> 01:03:02.043
- Is she covered on the hospital policy?
- As far as I know.

01:03:02.248 --> 01:03:04.478
Has anyone talked to the press office?

01:03:04.683 --> 01:03:06.413
This is bad publicity.

01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:10.386
Some damn TV network will try
to make a sentimental movie about her.

01:03:10.589 --> 01:03:12.989
I'll get on it.
Anybody know why she did it?

01:03:13.193 --> 01:03:15.718
No one knows.
Her fiancé didn't know anything.

01:03:15.929 --> 01:03:18.227
They're supposed
to get married in June.

01:03:26.306 --> 01:03:27.534
Who's next?

01:03:27.741 --> 01:03:29.402
I am, doctor.

01:03:35.049 --> 01:03:38.109
Now lean forward.
You feeling any pain?

01:03:38.319 --> 01:03:40.651
It's better when I lean forward.

01:03:41.989 --> 01:03:43.957
Lydia, could I borrow your pen?

01:03:46.561 --> 01:03:49.860
Mr. Larkowsky, I'm going
to admit you to the hospital...

01:03:50.064 --> 01:03:52.055
...and start you on a medical regimen.

01:03:52.266 --> 01:03:55.430
There's some question in my mind
whether that's necessary...

01:03:55.636 --> 01:03:57.968
...but it's better
to be safe than sorry.

01:04:02.677 --> 01:04:03.905
What is it?

01:04:07.683 --> 01:04:08.877
What's the matter?

01:04:09.685 --> 01:04:13.018
- You don't have to hide the truth from me.
- The truth?

01:04:13.222 --> 01:04:15.623
I know you're being nice,
but you can tell me.

01:04:15.824 --> 01:04:17.689
It's okay.
I want to know the truth.

01:04:18.794 --> 01:04:23.026
You have a duodenal ulcer
with complicating pancreatitis.

01:04:23.232 --> 01:04:27.260
Rather mild pancreatitis, judging
from the lab figures. That's all.

01:04:28.338 --> 01:04:29.929
Come on. You can tell me.

01:04:31.574 --> 01:04:33.700
You don't have cancer, Mr. Larkowsky.

01:04:37.647 --> 01:04:40.411
I knew it, I knew it!
It's cancer.

01:04:40.617 --> 01:04:43.017
You were hiding it.

01:04:45.688 --> 01:04:48.418
Every person that comes
into this hospital...

01:04:48.626 --> 01:04:51.458
...whether they have
a heart attack or a skin rash...

01:04:51.661 --> 01:04:53.220
...everybody worries about cancer.

01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:55.326
You don't have cancer.

01:04:55.532 --> 01:04:58.228
I swear to you.
You do not have cancer.

01:05:02.806 --> 01:05:03.795
It's not cancer?

01:05:05.609 --> 01:05:07.907
You have an ulcer
which flared up today...

01:05:08.112 --> 01:05:11.138
...because you went to a party
and drank and smoked.

01:05:11.548 --> 01:05:14.346
Both of which
you're gonna have to quit.

01:05:17.588 --> 01:05:20.854
- Quit smoking and drinking?
- Yeah, that's right.

01:05:22.159 --> 01:05:25.391
Quit smoking and drinking?
What, are you kidding me?

01:05:46.084 --> 01:05:49.213
- We'll have to get x-rays on him.
- Right away, doctor.

01:05:49.421 --> 01:05:51.014
How did this happen?

01:05:51.957 --> 01:05:53.289
He fell out of his crib.

01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:57.727
He fell out of his crib?

01:05:59.265 --> 01:06:01.358
He was crying all night,
so I came here.

01:06:01.567 --> 01:06:03.364
I bet he was.
When did he fall?

01:06:03.570 --> 01:06:05.868
I don't know.
I don't want to get into trouble.

01:06:06.072 --> 01:06:08.506
- Your son has multiple contusions.
- He's not my son.

01:06:08.708 --> 01:06:11.644
- Whatever your relationship is...
- I'm his babysitter!

01:06:20.821 --> 01:06:22.948
This child has been beaten.

01:06:28.495 --> 01:06:32.693
- I'm gonna call Children Services.
- Please! I'll get into trouble.

01:06:32.899 --> 01:06:34.299
Stay here.

01:06:34.868 --> 01:06:36.427
Yes, doctor.

01:06:44.879 --> 01:06:46.676
I don't believe this.

01:06:46.881 --> 01:06:49.748
You want to make a guess
on the diagnosis of this one?

01:06:55.691 --> 01:06:57.555
I burnt my legs.

01:06:58.060 --> 01:06:59.084
I see.

01:06:59.761 --> 01:07:00.750
It's not funny.

01:07:01.095 --> 01:07:04.360
If you'll just come with me,
I'll take your name.

01:07:04.565 --> 01:07:05.554
<i>College student?</i>

01:07:06.969 --> 01:07:07.957
<i>Sacred Heart.</i>

01:07:08.504 --> 01:07:10.300
And how'd this happen?

01:07:10.706 --> 01:07:13.937
I was pouring hot water
into the sink and it splashed.

01:07:14.410 --> 01:07:16.469
It's not bad.
First- degree burns.

01:07:16.678 --> 01:07:19.738
There's no blistering,
and there won't be any scarring.

01:07:20.617 --> 01:07:22.481
It's very sensitive skin.

01:07:23.852 --> 01:07:25.411
Your touch is nice.

01:07:25.621 --> 01:07:29.352
This medication will make
you feel a lot better.

01:07:30.526 --> 01:07:32.790
Your fingers are very long.

01:07:34.264 --> 01:07:36.254
Long and strong.

01:07:38.134 --> 01:07:41.365
I wanted to change first
and put on some new underpants.

01:07:42.605 --> 01:07:45.073
I knew you'd be seeing my underpants.

01:07:46.576 --> 01:07:47.634
And touching them.

01:07:50.013 --> 01:07:54.177
You'll want to keep these bandages
very dry for a day or so.

01:07:55.118 --> 01:07:58.952
Don't take any showers or baths.
Just a sponge bath.

01:08:00.023 --> 01:08:01.285
Why is that nurse here?

01:08:01.525 --> 01:08:02.685
Hospital policy.

01:08:02.893 --> 01:08:05.361
She's not assisting.
She doesn't have to be here.

01:08:08.198 --> 01:08:09.291
Are you afraid of me?

01:08:10.334 --> 01:08:12.996
You're gonna be just fine
in a few days.

01:08:23.381 --> 01:08:24.870
Thanks, Lydia.

01:08:47.939 --> 01:08:49.202
After dinner?

01:08:49.408 --> 01:08:51.899
Yeah, right after dinner...

01:08:52.109 --> 01:08:55.636
...I felt this little aching,
this burning, you know?

01:08:55.846 --> 01:08:57.145
Low.

01:08:57.350 --> 01:08:58.578
And you have an aneurysm?

01:08:58.783 --> 01:09:02.584
Yeah, they're gonna operate
on me next month.

01:09:03.389 --> 01:09:07.519
Mr. Harvey, we're just waiting
for your old film, so just rest easy.

01:09:07.727 --> 01:09:10.321
We'll fix you up right away.
We'll take care of it.

01:09:10.529 --> 01:09:11.827
Thank you, doctor.

01:09:12.032 --> 01:09:13.760
Okay, thank you.

01:09:14.268 --> 01:09:17.567
He's bleeding into his belly.
He can go anytime. Who's on?

01:09:17.770 --> 01:09:19.600
Ashley and Jimmy
have the appendectomy.

01:09:19.805 --> 01:09:21.863
Gill and Levine are
with the knife wound.

01:09:22.075 --> 01:09:25.135
They pulled Ed to do the lady
with the small bowel.

01:09:25.310 --> 01:09:26.301
Vascular team?

01:09:26.511 --> 01:09:28.776
- In Minneapolis.
- Where's Baker?

01:09:28.982 --> 01:09:30.279
Baker's in the Bahamas.

01:09:30.484 --> 01:09:32.145
This guy could die any minute.

01:09:32.352 --> 01:09:34.343
I know, but there's no one to do him.

01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:44.224
Okay, call Morgenstern.
Tell him to get over here.

01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:46.161
I'm starting a ruptured aneurysm.

01:09:46.367 --> 01:09:48.095
You can't.
You're just a resident.

01:09:48.303 --> 01:09:50.930
What do you want to do?
This guy could die.

01:09:51.238 --> 01:09:52.636
- I know that, but...
- Look!

01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:56.207
I'm just trying to keep him alive
until Morgenstern shows up.

01:09:56.644 --> 01:09:59.943
Now call the O.R. And tell them
to set up for a laparotomy.

01:10:00.148 --> 01:10:01.274
Please.

01:10:06.955 --> 01:10:09.219
This is Dr. Lewis.
Get me Morgenstern.

01:10:09.424 --> 01:10:12.951
Find him! We have an aortic
aneurysm, and Dr. Benton's starting.

01:10:13.162 --> 01:10:15.960
He'd like some help.
That's right. Dr. Benton's starting.

01:10:19.501 --> 01:10:22.095
- What's on?
- Ruptured abdominal aneurysm.

01:10:22.304 --> 01:10:24.534
- Who's doing it?
- Dr. Benton.

01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:26.571
Dr. Benton?

01:10:34.049 --> 01:10:35.710
I'm doing anesthesia for you.

01:10:35.919 --> 01:10:40.014
Great. Get down to the blood bank,
make sure they send us 20 units.

01:10:40.222 --> 01:10:43.351
And get the nurses jumping.
The patient's on his way.

01:10:46.429 --> 01:10:48.727
You sure you're okay about this?

01:10:48.932 --> 01:10:52.026
I'm scared as hell.
The guy's already ruptured his belly.

01:10:52.235 --> 01:10:54.396
He's bleeding to death internally.

01:10:54.604 --> 01:10:57.631
I gotta do him.
I'm his only chance.

01:11:24.035 --> 01:11:26.004
Evening. I wanted you to know...

01:11:26.203 --> 01:11:29.696
...I'll be starting a ruptured
aortic aneurysm in Room 2.

01:11:29.907 --> 01:11:31.967
I'd appreciate a hand
when you have a minute.

01:11:37.416 --> 01:11:40.543
- What did he say?
- He said he's doing an aneurysm.

01:11:40.819 --> 01:11:42.548
That's a joke, isn't it?

01:11:42.754 --> 01:11:45.484
Cheryl? Go make sure he's joking.

01:11:54.166 --> 01:11:56.465
Dr. Ashley, he's doing it.

01:11:56.669 --> 01:11:59.001
You're kidding!
Jim, break and help him.

01:11:59.205 --> 01:12:02.071
I'll finish here
and get there as soon as I can.

01:12:13.587 --> 01:12:16.214
Okay, boys and girls, let's go.
This isn't a picnic.

01:12:16.389 --> 01:12:17.378
Prep, please.

01:12:17.757 --> 01:12:20.352
Prep, please!
Come on, quit staring at me.

01:12:20.561 --> 01:12:22.893
I'm just trying
to keep the poor guy alive.

01:12:23.097 --> 01:12:24.358
All right, plastic.

01:12:25.132 --> 01:12:27.600
- Jimmy's coming in to help.
- Oh, great!

01:12:28.335 --> 01:12:32.328
The only guy that knows less
about vascular surgery than I do.

01:12:32.539 --> 01:12:35.201
- Okay, is Mr. Harvey happy?
- He isn't complaining.

01:12:35.409 --> 01:12:37.570
Then let's do this.
Knife, please.

01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:39.468
Thank you.

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:42.105
We're starting at 2:13 a.m.

01:12:42.316 --> 01:12:46.980
Let's see how long the chief takes
to get off of his girl and into work.

01:12:49.556 --> 01:12:51.081
Nice and slow.

01:12:51.292 --> 01:12:52.589
Started without you, Jimmy.

01:12:53.495 --> 01:12:54.723
There you go, sir.

01:12:55.195 --> 01:12:57.756
Listen up. We're going
straight down the linea alba.

01:12:57.966 --> 01:13:00.958
Nothing fancy.
The guy's got a 50% mortality anyway.

01:13:01.436 --> 01:13:04.405
Suction.
Thank you, for all the good it'll do.

01:13:04.973 --> 01:13:06.908
Pick up.
Come on, Jimmy, work with me.

01:13:07.108 --> 01:13:08.234
Pick up.

01:13:09.211 --> 01:13:10.768
Lot of blood in there.

01:13:10.979 --> 01:13:12.947
It's precisely his problem.

01:13:13.716 --> 01:13:16.014
Okay, here we go.

01:13:16.218 --> 01:13:18.243
Wish me luck. Knife.

01:13:26.328 --> 01:13:27.818
Systolic's holding at 100.

01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:32.394
Mother!

01:13:33.036 --> 01:13:34.297
Now!

01:13:48.852 --> 01:13:50.342
Can't find it.

01:13:50.854 --> 01:13:51.980
Damn it!

01:13:53.390 --> 01:13:55.517
There! No, no.

01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:00.187
Get your hand in there
and push away the small intestine.

01:14:01.598 --> 01:14:04.465
Where are you, little leak?
How bad is his pressure?

01:14:04.668 --> 01:14:08.161
- You won't like it.
- I won't like it? Think about him.

01:14:08.339 --> 01:14:09.328
Carol...

01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:13.340
...hang 6 more units packed cells
and a unit of plasma and platelets.

01:14:13.543 --> 01:14:14.874
Wait a minute.

01:14:15.912 --> 01:14:17.710
Wait a minute.

01:14:19.784 --> 01:14:21.513
It's too much to hope, huh?

01:14:23.521 --> 01:14:25.285
I got it.

01:14:25.490 --> 01:14:26.889
Yeah, I got it.
Time down.

01:14:27.091 --> 01:14:28.217
Call it out in minutes.

01:14:28.426 --> 01:14:31.691
Let's suck this field clean
so we can see what we're doing.

01:14:31.896 --> 01:14:35.492
Dr. Benton, the chief resident is
in the hospital and on his way.

01:14:35.701 --> 01:14:38.533
Well, suck that field clean,
we got the chief coming!

01:14:38.736 --> 01:14:41.831
We don't want him to think
we don't know what we're doing.

01:14:43.174 --> 01:14:45.939
- Pressure?
- 100 over 70 and falling.

01:14:46.144 --> 01:14:49.375
I won't sweat that.
Let's just keep that blood going in.

01:14:50.616 --> 01:14:52.641
Jimmy, your hands are trembling.

01:14:52.851 --> 01:14:56.150
- I can't imagine why.
- Yeah, well, me neither.

01:14:56.588 --> 01:15:00.650
But everything's cool here.
All we have to do is sit and wait.

01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:03.795
Dr. Ashley will be with you
as soon as he can.

01:15:03.997 --> 01:15:06.988
All of a sudden, I got all
the help I want, huh?

01:15:16.709 --> 01:15:18.734
Start a nitroglycerine drip.

01:15:18.945 --> 01:15:21.573
50 and 250 D5W,
80 of Lasix. IV push.

01:15:21.781 --> 01:15:24.546
Get a CBC, lytes, cardiac enzyme...

01:15:24.751 --> 01:15:27.721
...chest X-ray and a 12-reading EKG.

01:15:28.187 --> 01:15:29.951
You take digitalis, dear?

01:15:30.157 --> 01:15:33.216
Have you taken any today?
This morning?

01:15:33.427 --> 01:15:34.621
Add a dig. Level.

01:15:34.828 --> 01:15:38.559
Meanwhile, 3 milligrams
of morphine. IV push.

01:15:42.937 --> 01:15:44.131
I can't give this up.

01:15:46.073 --> 01:15:48.304
No, no, no.
Not you, you're fine.

01:15:48.709 --> 01:15:52.270
- Your wife on 2204.
- I'll have to call her back.

01:16:14.303 --> 01:16:16.998
Sure taking a long time
getting in here, huh?

01:16:20.609 --> 01:16:23.306
They've been out there scrubbing
for the last month.

01:16:24.914 --> 01:16:29.146
You know, it's times like these
when I get into a reflective mood...

01:16:29.352 --> 01:16:31.286
...and I pause and think of how...

01:16:31.487 --> 01:16:33.717
Good morning, Peter.
Give it to me quick.

01:16:33.923 --> 01:16:37.290
57-year-old male, in good health,
seen here 8 weeks ago...

01:16:37.493 --> 01:16:40.429
...where he was found to have
a pulsatile abdominal mass...

01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:42.656
...with aortic calcification on X-ray.

01:16:42.999 --> 01:16:44.934
Surgery was scheduled for next month.

01:16:45.135 --> 01:16:48.400
But this evening, he had
intermittent pain in the mid-back.

01:16:48.605 --> 01:16:50.071
When he got here, he had...

01:16:50.272 --> 01:16:53.639
...a distended abdomen, peritoneal
irritation and reduced hematocrit.

01:16:53.843 --> 01:16:56.141
So you decided to open him up.

01:16:56.346 --> 01:16:58.644
This is the worst incision
I've seen in a while.

01:16:59.216 --> 01:17:02.413
A good veterinarian would do
a better skin cut than that.

01:17:03.153 --> 01:17:05.451
All right, hold on.

01:17:08.826 --> 01:17:09.884
Got it.

01:17:10.061 --> 01:17:11.050
What's his pressure?

01:17:11.262 --> 01:17:14.322
90 over 65,
and he's gotten 12 units.

01:17:14.532 --> 01:17:17.432
We'll take over from here,
try to make something out of it.

01:17:17.634 --> 01:17:20.229
Hey, humor me.
Have some dopamine standing by.

01:17:20.438 --> 01:17:22.234
Hoover that, will you?

01:17:24.676 --> 01:17:26.507
Sounds like a plan.
Good.

01:17:26.711 --> 01:17:28.906
Give me a little more room in there.

01:17:29.114 --> 01:17:30.274
Thank you.

01:17:32.216 --> 01:17:33.741
Look at that.

01:17:39.257 --> 01:17:41.088
You did a good job.

01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:44.028
You were lucky,
but you were right to open him up.

01:17:44.595 --> 01:17:45.857
Good work.

01:17:46.298 --> 01:17:47.697
Yeah, clear it out.

01:17:48.199 --> 01:17:49.292
Let me see if I can...

01:17:49.768 --> 01:17:51.565
Pull it out for a second.

01:17:52.805 --> 01:17:55.774
That's what we want, right there.
That's right.

01:18:22.035 --> 01:18:25.334
Why is he still crying?
Why haven't you given him something?

01:18:29.075 --> 01:18:33.137
Look! He's still crying.
Why aren't you giving him something?

01:18:33.346 --> 01:18:36.441
I can't until I know
the extent of his injuries.

01:18:36.650 --> 01:18:38.914
He's been to X-ray.
We saw a skull fracture.

01:18:39.119 --> 01:18:41.610
A skull fracture?
The babysitter!

01:18:41.989 --> 01:18:43.183
I never trusted her.

01:18:43.390 --> 01:18:46.188
Your child has contusions
that are 12 hours old.

01:18:46.393 --> 01:18:50.762
He has a skull fracture. He also has
several old healed fractures.

01:18:50.966 --> 01:18:52.956
This is a battered child.

01:18:54.869 --> 01:18:59.034
I'm not even gonna respond to that.
You think I'd harm my child?

01:18:59.241 --> 01:19:00.435
It happens all the time.

01:19:00.641 --> 01:19:02.337
I'm taking him home.

01:19:02.544 --> 01:19:05.376
- No! You have anything to say?
- He's my date.

01:19:11.052 --> 01:19:12.815
Look.

01:19:13.021 --> 01:19:15.182
I can assure you, whoever you are...

01:19:15.690 --> 01:19:17.123
Dr. Ross.

01:19:18.994 --> 01:19:23.021
Dr. Ross, let me tell you
your concerns are unfounded, okay?

01:19:25.467 --> 01:19:27.402
How'd he burn his legs?

01:19:27.603 --> 01:19:29.537
These marks right here.
On his legs.

01:19:30.305 --> 01:19:34.242
Those are healed burn scars.
How did that happen?

01:19:39.515 --> 01:19:44.317
I don't know anything about burns.
I think you're making this up.

01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:46.750
- You might call an attorney.
- I am an attorney!

01:19:46.956 --> 01:19:49.322
Then you know what Child Services
will do.

01:19:49.525 --> 01:19:50.890
How dare you?

01:19:51.094 --> 01:19:54.962
How dare you treat your child
like this? He's a little kid!

01:19:55.732 --> 01:20:00.169
I try to be understanding in my job.
But, lady, this just stinks.

01:20:13.383 --> 01:20:15.544
- You find that chart?
- I can't find it.

01:20:15.752 --> 01:20:17.084
- Well, find it!
- I don't...

01:20:17.288 --> 01:20:19.620
Do you think I am deaf?
I heard you.

01:20:19.824 --> 01:20:23.623
- Now find me the chart!
- I told you, I don't know where it is!

01:20:32.737 --> 01:20:33.863
Is it okay?

01:20:34.072 --> 01:20:36.165
You can go now.
You did the right thing.

01:20:36.374 --> 01:20:38.673
I mean, is the baby okay?

01:20:40.545 --> 01:20:41.807
He will be.

01:20:52.223 --> 01:20:53.486
Oh, man!

01:20:55.627 --> 01:20:57.493
So how's Hathaway?

01:20:58.230 --> 01:20:59.754
It doesn't look good.

01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:03.168
They contact her family?

01:21:03.602 --> 01:21:05.035
Yeah, they found them.

01:21:07.473 --> 01:21:09.941
So how'd your aortic aneurysm go?

01:21:10.242 --> 01:21:12.006
Morgenstern showed.

01:21:13.479 --> 01:21:16.415
<i>Dr. Benton to Trauma 1.
Dr. Benton to Trauma 1.</i>

01:21:19.853 --> 01:21:21.787
No rest for the wicked.

01:21:25.592 --> 01:21:27.924
Jerry, Perez. Let's go.

01:21:28.128 --> 01:21:30.927
- What's the problem?
- We picked him up in Old Town.

01:21:31.131 --> 01:21:34.066
He was standing, blocking traffic.

01:21:34.267 --> 01:21:36.964
But he's got that smell,
so I thought I'd check.

01:21:37.637 --> 01:21:39.434
You did the right thing.

01:21:39.639 --> 01:21:42.837
We got a diabetic ketoacidosis.
Let's go.

01:21:43.109 --> 01:21:44.805
You probably saved his life.

01:21:48.849 --> 01:21:50.441
What do you want, a medal?

01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:55.120
Give him 10 units regular insulin,
IV push.

01:21:55.323 --> 01:21:57.121
Start a drip, 10 units per hour.

01:21:57.325 --> 01:22:00.727
I want him hydrated as soon
as possible with normal saline.

01:22:00.928 --> 01:22:02.225
And you want KCI?

01:22:02.430 --> 01:22:04.830
Not on your life.
Get a CBC and lytes.

01:22:05.033 --> 01:22:07.933
Call me with the potassium,
and get a blood gas.

01:22:08.904 --> 01:22:11.338
Did you get the message
your wife called?

01:22:11.539 --> 01:22:12.631
No.

01:22:16.144 --> 01:22:18.009
I'll call her in the morning.

01:22:20.449 --> 01:22:22.212
Hello, Mrs. Harvey.

01:22:22.551 --> 01:22:25.042
Okay, let's have a look here.

01:22:33.061 --> 01:22:34.689
He seems to be doing fine.

01:22:34.897 --> 01:22:36.659
Oh, I'm so grateful.

01:22:36.866 --> 01:22:40.495
Dr. Morgenstern came so quickly.
He saved his life.

01:22:41.571 --> 01:22:44.699
Yes, well, Dr. Morgenstern's
a wonderful surgeon.

01:22:44.907 --> 01:22:46.397
He said you did a lot too.

01:22:49.412 --> 01:22:52.871
Actually, I just helped out
a little bit. That's all.

01:22:53.349 --> 01:22:55.442
I'll check on you later, okay?

01:23:16.673 --> 01:23:18.869
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

01:23:26.450 --> 01:23:28.442
You want some coffee?

01:23:30.755 --> 01:23:31.847
Sure.

01:23:40.698 --> 01:23:44.225
I wouldn't kid you about that.
I had a few.

01:23:44.803 --> 01:23:46.703
Maybe more than a few.

01:23:47.972 --> 01:23:50.304
Hell of a party, though!

01:23:53.312 --> 01:23:55.803
Okay, Mr. Murphy, you are done.

01:23:56.014 --> 01:23:57.346
Already?

01:23:59.551 --> 01:24:01.019
I didn't feel a thing.

01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:02.881
No, I didn't.

01:24:03.656 --> 01:24:04.953
I still don't.

01:24:05.691 --> 01:24:10.321
<i>And he was in, I guess, ten days.
And you know what it cost?</i>

01:24:10.529 --> 01:24:13.431
<i>$ 24,000.
More than $ 24,000!</i>

01:24:13.632 --> 01:24:15.293
<i>That's what it cost.</i>

01:24:15.735 --> 01:24:20.570
<i>And I want to know where doctors
get off charging money like that?</i>

01:24:20.773 --> 01:24:23.367
<i>Medical costs certainly
are on the rise.</i>

01:24:23.577 --> 01:24:26.239
<i>That's why we need
national health insurance.</i>

01:24:26.446 --> 01:24:30.211
<i>It's a scandal! Those doctors
should be ashamed of themselves.</i>

01:24:30.884 --> 01:24:34.615
<i>Many of them are, I'm sure.
Let's hear what folks out there think.</i>

01:24:34.822 --> 01:24:38.882
<i>Call Carl Barker on Nightline.
We'll be back in just a minute.</i>

01:24:41.963 --> 01:24:43.897
That's it? Anybody else?

01:24:44.132 --> 01:24:47.100
Well, I got a little problem.
My throat's acting up.

01:24:47.435 --> 01:24:49.265
You need to see a doctor.

01:24:49.469 --> 01:24:52.132
- Which room?
- Five and six are open.

01:24:52.340 --> 01:24:53.432
Five.

01:25:12.461 --> 01:25:13.792
Is that it?

01:25:13.996 --> 01:25:16.362
Well, my throat.
I've got some soreness.

01:25:16.564 --> 01:25:17.964
I'll be in Room 8.

01:25:18.167 --> 01:25:20.431
You got a pen?
Wake me at 6:30.

01:25:20.636 --> 01:25:23.196
That gives you an hour and a half.
