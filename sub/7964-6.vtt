00:04.280 --> 00:07.960
ANOUK: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Le Calmar,

00:04.280 --> 00:07.960
Saint-Marie.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.120
I know that many of you have been

00:08.000 --> 00:11.120
to our place in London.

00:11.160 --> 00:14.800
So, we're absolutely delighted that you've made

00:11.160 --> 00:14.800
the trip over here

00:14.840 --> 00:20.600
to share in this next exciting step

00:14.840 --> 00:20.600
of Le Calmar's journey here,

00:20.840 --> 00:23.600
on this gorgeous gem of an island.

00:23.640 --> 00:27.520
It promises to be a truly special experience.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.520
Robert Holt, everyone.

00:31.520 --> 00:34.760
As you're aware, this is our

00:31.520 --> 00:34.760
first soft opening,

00:34.800 --> 00:36.640
so we're operating a limited menu,

00:36.920 --> 00:38.960
albeit one with a Caribbean twist.

00:39.440 --> 00:42.440
But the thing that won't be limited

00:39.440 --> 00:42.440
is the quality

00:42.920 --> 00:45.240
that you've come to expect from Le Calmar

00:45.280 --> 00:49.520
and the chance to be a part of Robert Holt's unique vision.

00:50.680 --> 00:54.400
Thank you. Let the food do the talking.

00:58.400 --> 01:00.840
MAN: We need you now!

01:00.880 --> 01:01.920
Service.

01:02.320 --> 01:03.920
I thought you said we'd cut the list in half?

01:03.960 --> 01:05.680
I did my best but I couldn't get

01:03.960 --> 01:05.680
a hold of anyone.

01:05.760 --> 01:08.840
-Two calamari. -DEXTER:

01:05.760 --> 01:08.840
Kim, how's the desserts?

01:09.520 --> 01:11.840
Kim, desserts for table 5.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.080
Kim, keep it together.

01:16.120 --> 01:17.720
-For God's sake. -Kim!

01:18.400 --> 01:20.920
-I knew I should've left. -Well,

01:18.400 --> 01:20.920
it's too late for that now.

01:22.600 --> 01:25.560
It's just a normal night, okay?

01:22.600 --> 01:25.560
Just a normal night.

01:34.960 --> 01:37.360
I'm sorry, there are no photo opportunities.

01:37.400 --> 01:41.200
You know what Robert's like. Monastic discipline

01:37.400 --> 01:41.200
and no distractions.

01:41.600 --> 01:43.400
-Thank you. -It won't happen again.

01:43.440 --> 01:47.720
Forget Robert, all right? Just follow me.

01:43.440 --> 01:47.720
Follow my lead, okay?

01:49.560 --> 01:50.960
You have to get back in there!

01:59.600 --> 02:00.960
No photographs!

02:01.480 --> 02:02.800
I'm sorry, I did say.

02:03.640 --> 02:06.720
DEXTER: Desserts for table five.

02:03.640 --> 02:06.720
Matt, get me the plates.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.720
We'll save you a gin and tonic.

02:17.760 --> 02:20.120
Yeah, I might just kip here tonight.

02:20.360 --> 02:22.160
Oh. Goodnight, darling.

02:43.120 --> 02:44.240
ANOUK: Perfect.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.320
Thank you.

02:47.680 --> 02:50.320
Hello! Sorry about this.

02:51.240 --> 02:54.880
I thought you were coming after 9:00. Follow me.

02:59.440 --> 03:00.960
Come in, come in.

03:06.120 --> 03:07.280
Robert?

03:08.400 --> 03:09.520
Robert?

03:10.680 --> 03:14.440
-Oh, my God!

03:14.480 --> 03:17.320
Freezer door's open.

03:17.360 --> 03:19.000
In here!

03:21.000 --> 03:22.240
Oh, my God!

04:02.080 --> 04:03.920
Hey! You little...

04:07.880 --> 04:10.240
Out of breath, Granddad?

04:12.680 --> 04:13.800
Toe-rag!

04:16.560 --> 04:18.120
-HUMPHREY: Good morning. -Chief.

04:18.160 --> 04:19.440
HUMPHREY: What have you got there?

04:19.800 --> 04:23.000
-Absolutely.

04:23.040 --> 04:24.600
Really?

04:24.640 --> 04:27.680
See how the world's leading men

04:24.640 --> 04:27.680
put theory into practice.

04:27.720 --> 04:28.920
Good morning, everyone.

04:29.680 --> 04:33.360
-Morning. -Calling JP, nanu-nanu.

04:33.920 --> 04:37.960
-He's in love. -Man, Rosey's amazing.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.360
You know, last night, she cooked this

04:38.000 --> 04:41.360
wonderful meal.

04:41.440 --> 04:43.120
And then we went down to the beach

04:43.160 --> 04:46.080
and ate under the stars and then she

04:43.160 --> 04:46.080
gave me an envelope!

04:46.360 --> 04:48.120
"Got you a present," she said.

04:48.160 --> 04:49.400
DWAYNE: So why'd she get you a present?

04:49.440 --> 04:51.240
Our two-month anniversary.

04:51.720 --> 04:53.040
It's a weekend away in Guadeloupe.

04:53.080 --> 04:55.920
And then this morning, she made me my lunch.

04:59.120 --> 05:00.760
How are you going to top all that?

05:00.800 --> 05:03.360
What do you mean, top all that?

05:03.960 --> 05:05.800
It's your three-month anniversary

05:03.960 --> 05:05.800
coming up, right?

05:05.840 --> 05:07.040
Yes...

05:07.080 --> 05:08.560
Then you'll have the fourth, the fifth,

05:08.600 --> 05:11.320
the sixth, not to mention Valentine's Day,

05:11.360 --> 05:13.800
Easter, Christmas.

05:13.840 --> 05:17.760
And, oh, lordy, lest you forget, her birthday.

05:18.480 --> 05:19.920
You're in big, big trouble, man.

05:19.960 --> 05:23.480
Well, when you put it like that, Dwayne.

05:23.520 --> 05:24.680
I did.

05:26.080 --> 05:29.440
Man, why is everything a competition?

05:30.840 --> 05:32.880
Well, for once, to be fair,

05:32.920 --> 05:36.200
you must remember what the ancients

05:32.920 --> 05:36.200
said about the art of love.

05:36.760 --> 05:40.720
Once you have secured the battlefield, you must then

05:36.760 --> 05:40.720
massacre the enemy.

05:42.240 --> 05:44.320
Or was that the art of war?

05:44.360 --> 05:46.760
Yeah, sorry, it's the art of war.

05:44.360 --> 05:46.760
Carry on.

05:47.400 --> 05:49.200
Oh, I'll tell you what, JP.

05:49.240 --> 05:53.120
Um... You, me, tonight, my place.

05:49.240 --> 05:53.120
Beers, popcorn, all of these.

05:53.680 --> 05:57.240
-Give you some ideas. -Yes, yes, okay, yes.

05:58.720 --> 06:00.920
-Good. -DWAYNE:

05:58.720 --> 06:00.920
Honore Police Station.

06:02.120 --> 06:04.400
Okay. Chief!

06:05.520 --> 06:07.720
There's been a murder up at that new restaurant.

06:09.160 --> 06:12.720
Minor stab wound in upper back.

06:09.160 --> 06:12.720
Major stab wound in the chest.

06:13.280 --> 06:17.080
Robert Holt, 48. Michelin-starred chef

06:13.280 --> 06:17.080
of Le Calmar, London.

06:17.120 --> 06:20.720
About to open the hotly anticipated

06:17.120 --> 06:20.720
Le Calmar, Saint-Marie.

06:20.840 --> 06:24.160
Last night was the first soft opening,

06:20.840 --> 06:24.160
official one next week.

06:24.240 --> 06:26.880
From the positioning, I would say definitely

06:24.240 --> 06:26.880
attacked from behind,

06:26.920 --> 06:28.040
turned round and then...

06:29.040 --> 06:31.400
Murder weapon. Don't tell me,

06:29.040 --> 06:31.400
handle's been wiped.

06:31.440 --> 06:35.840
Sure looks like it. Kitchen knife.

06:31.440 --> 06:35.840
It's personalised, I think.

06:36.080 --> 06:38.000
His initials carved in the handle.

06:38.880 --> 06:41.160
Mmm. Punshen, Danish.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.520
Set you back a small fortune. Time of death?

06:43.600 --> 06:45.360
Hard to pinpoint as he's been in a freezer.

06:45.920 --> 06:49.840
Can't measure accurate body temperature and can't tell

06:45.920 --> 06:49.840
when rigor mortis set in.

06:49.880 --> 06:52.720
I mean, maybe post-mortem might be able to

06:49.880 --> 06:52.720
narrow it down.

06:52.760 --> 06:57.200
-11:30 p.m.,

06:52.760 --> 06:57.200
when his staff left.

06:57.240 --> 06:59.240
Found this morning when they re-opened.

06:59.480 --> 07:02.600
His partner, also the manager, his son and two other chefs

07:02.640 --> 07:04.760
all spent the night in the villa

07:02.640 --> 07:04.760
they're renting

07:04.800 --> 07:06.480
on the other side of the island.

07:06.520 --> 07:09.520
-Well, they are the core team,

07:09.560 --> 07:11.200
so they're setting it up with the intention

07:11.240 --> 07:14.120
other staff will take over and they will go

07:11.240 --> 07:14.120
back to London.

07:14.640 --> 07:16.920
Robert said he was staying the night here

07:16.960 --> 07:19.600
but apparently, the sofa bed has

07:16.960 --> 07:19.600
not been opened.

07:20.240 --> 07:24.800
-Well, his partner

07:20.240 --> 07:24.800
says there is £4,000

07:24.840 --> 07:27.240
taken from the safe. Also, his smartphone is gone.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.120
I've got details of the make and model.

07:29.160 --> 07:33.440
Lintmar Baudet. Very nice. These cost around

07:29.160 --> 07:33.440
40 grand, I'd say.

07:34.160 --> 07:37.800
Personalised Danish knives, £40,000 watches.

07:37.840 --> 07:39.400
He liked his little luxuries.

07:39.440 --> 07:40.560
-Yeah.

07:40.680 --> 07:42.400
-Over here. -Yeah.

07:45.920 --> 07:48.800
Set of 10 personalised knives. One missing.

07:48.840 --> 07:50.160
HUMPHREY: Yes.

07:51.240 --> 07:54.080
Gosh! Look at that. This knife has been sharpened

07:54.120 --> 07:56.640
with a bias to the right-hand side.

07:57.600 --> 08:01.640
Our victim was a <i> sinistra.</i> Left-handed, Dwayne.

08:02.480 --> 08:04.720
Did you know, 10% of all people

08:02.480 --> 08:04.720
are left-handed

08:04.760 --> 08:08.800
but can you guess how many Mensa

08:04.760 --> 08:08.800
members are, hmm?

08:08.840 --> 08:11.200
Twenty percent. Isn't that fascinating?

08:11.600 --> 08:14.040
-Isn't it just. -Yes.

08:14.480 --> 08:18.640
Apparently most parrots are left-footed.

08:14.480 --> 08:18.640
Or is that left

08:20.120 --> 08:21.360
JP: Have a look at this.

08:23.160 --> 08:24.840
Back and front doors were locked.

08:24.880 --> 08:26.840
No sign of forced entry anywhere.

08:27.720 --> 08:29.280
DWAYNE: The burglar must have got in through there?

08:31.640 --> 08:35.360
They're not working, believe it or not.

08:31.640 --> 08:35.360
Teething problems.

08:37.240 --> 08:39.040
This is zinc, isn't it?

08:42.240 --> 08:43.960
Uh-huh. No footprints.

08:44.680 --> 08:47.120
You see, zinc gets marked and stained very easily.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.840
And it won't fade. You have to wipe it off.

08:48.920 --> 08:50.400
See? Nothing there.

08:50.640 --> 08:53.120
So the intruder must have wiped them off

08:50.640 --> 08:53.120
after they got inside.

08:53.160 --> 08:56.200
Maybe. But he couldn't have done that

08:53.160 --> 08:56.200
on the way out, could he?

08:56.360 --> 08:59.000
Anyway, who said there was an intruder?

08:59.840 --> 09:02.760
A struggle in the kitchen, money gone from the safe.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.600
Looks like a botched burglary to me.

09:04.640 --> 09:06.320
But there was no sign of a struggle

09:06.360 --> 09:08.400
in the corridor or in the office

09:06.360 --> 09:08.400
where the money was taken.

09:08.920 --> 09:11.080
And what was Robert doing in the freezer?

09:11.120 --> 09:12.480
Maybe he fought back.

09:12.520 --> 09:14.680
Then how come he was stabbed in the back first?

09:15.000 --> 09:17.320
That suggests someone creeping up

09:15.000 --> 09:17.320
on him from behind.

09:17.360 --> 09:20.120
But someone stole the money and his phone.

09:20.240 --> 09:21.600
So, we're dealing with a thief

09:21.640 --> 09:22.920
who's clever enough not to leave fingerprints

09:22.960 --> 09:24.640
and levitate above a worktop

09:24.680 --> 09:28.320
but dumb enough to leave behind

09:24.680 --> 09:28.320
a watch worth a fortune, hmm.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.920
So, a botched burglary is what it looks like.

09:31.960 --> 09:34.000
But that's exactly what it is not.

09:36.160 --> 09:38.280
I think it's time we met the kitchen crew.

09:38.320 --> 09:39.760
Don't you?

09:42.480 --> 09:44.880
So, the last time you all saw Robert

09:44.920 --> 09:48.080
was when you left here in a taxi at 11:30 p.m.?

09:48.120 --> 09:51.040
Yes. He wanted to stay here.

09:51.840 --> 09:53.680
At busy times, he'd often sleep over.

09:53.720 --> 09:56.920
He couldn't wait to plan the menu,

09:53.720 --> 09:56.920
prepare for the following day.

09:56.960 --> 10:01.320
And would he have stayed up all night preparing?

10:01.360 --> 10:02.720
No, not all night, no.

10:02.760 --> 10:04.680
But certainly well into the night.

10:05.240 --> 10:06.920
He was a total workaholic.

10:07.480 --> 10:11.160
And who else did he know on the island?

10:07.480 --> 10:11.160
Suppliers, decorators?

10:11.200 --> 10:13.240
No, no one.

10:13.520 --> 10:16.560
Dexter deals with supplies and I deal with everyone else.

10:16.760 --> 10:19.960
-Well,

10:16.760 --> 10:19.960
they didn't even know him.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.720
I mean, they only arrived yesterday

10:20.000 --> 10:23.720
afternoon and I briefed them.

10:23.800 --> 10:26.280
They didn't even speak to Robert.

10:26.320 --> 10:28.360
What about socially, in the evening?

10:28.640 --> 10:31.640
Did he go to bars or other restaurants?

10:31.680 --> 10:33.200
You're joking.

10:33.240 --> 10:34.640
He was like a monk,

10:35.040 --> 10:39.520
strict routine and no deviation, just swim,

10:35.040 --> 10:39.520
power yoga and here.

10:40.080 --> 10:41.960
Robert didn't do socialising.

10:43.240 --> 10:45.200
Man was a genius.

10:45.240 --> 10:47.360
Just complete and utter dedication to the kitchen.

10:47.960 --> 10:51.440
And during evening service, was there anything unusual,

10:47.960 --> 10:51.440
anything untoward?

10:51.480 --> 10:53.000
It was seamless.

10:53.240 --> 10:55.760
And you all left together at 11:30,

10:53.240 --> 10:55.760
went directly to the villa,

10:55.800 --> 10:57.960
and no one had any contact or saw Robert

10:58.000 --> 11:00.800
until the body was discovered at 8:35 this morning?

11:00.840 --> 11:02.240
That's right.

11:02.280 --> 11:05.640
So, you were together in the villa all night?

11:06.040 --> 11:07.760
None of you left to go anywhere?

11:07.800 --> 11:10.520
We were exhausted. I dropped like a stone.

11:11.360 --> 11:13.200
I crashed almost straight away.

11:15.520 --> 11:18.800
What? Yeah. Yeah, same here.

11:18.840 --> 11:21.240
Same. Anything to confirm that?

11:22.080 --> 11:24.960
There are... There are CCTV

11:22.080 --> 11:24.960
cameras up at the villa,

11:25.000 --> 11:27.520
-you're welcome to have a look.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.520
-Yes, we will, thank you.

11:27.560 --> 11:30.440
Sorry, but I have to ask, will this take much longer?

11:30.800 --> 11:32.880
Only, my wife and daughter will be landing

11:30.800 --> 11:32.880
in half an hour.

11:32.920 --> 11:35.720
Well, I assure you that we won't keep you

11:32.920 --> 11:35.720
longer than necessary.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.840
Talking about the CCTV, I meant to ask,

11:39.120 --> 11:41.960
the CCTV here, teething problems?

11:42.240 --> 11:46.760
Yes, it was a complicated system

11:42.240 --> 11:46.760
to set up.

11:47.160 --> 11:50.840
Robert wanted it everywhere. He liked to be

11:47.160 --> 11:50.840
on top of things.

11:52.240 --> 11:55.840
I just wish we...

11:57.840 --> 12:00.680
hadn't left him here with all that money

11:57.840 --> 12:00.680
on his own.

12:00.920 --> 12:04.600
Yes, unfortunately that would've made no difference,

12:00.920 --> 12:04.600
because no one broke in.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.920
I mean, you unlocked the door this morning. Correct?

12:09.280 --> 12:10.800
-Yes. -But the window.

12:10.840 --> 12:12.520
The money. I mean, the safe.

12:12.560 --> 12:14.760
Yes, well, someone definitely tried to make it

12:12.560 --> 12:14.760
look that way.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.400
That's for sure.

12:16.440 --> 12:19.200
I'm sorry, but if this wasn't a break

12:21.600 --> 12:25.920
That's ridiculous.

12:30.200 --> 12:33.640
I'm Gary, Robert's brother. Who are you?

12:37.120 --> 12:39.720
I can't believe it. I only saw him

12:37.120 --> 12:39.720
yesterday morning.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.880
How long have you been on Saint

12:42.960 --> 12:46.520
Uh, I came last Friday to help out.

12:46.560 --> 12:49.360
-Help, as in... -You know, carry deliveries,

12:49.400 --> 12:50.760
do bits and bobs round the place.

12:50.800 --> 12:53.640
I mean, I'm a businessman, not a chef but, uh,

12:54.320 --> 12:57.240
you know, we all need moral support

12:54.320 --> 12:57.240
when the pressure was on.

12:57.280 --> 13:01.480
But you weren't here last night

12:57.280 --> 13:01.480
for the first soft opening.

13:01.520 --> 13:03.200
Yeah, he didn't like people getting under his feet.

13:03.240 --> 13:06.040
-I wish I was now.

13:06.080 --> 13:08.640
I certainly I wouldn't have let him

13:06.080 --> 13:08.640
stay here on his own.

13:09.040 --> 13:11.720
No, I've rented a little place by the beach.

13:11.760 --> 13:12.840
And last night?

13:16.080 --> 13:17.840
Yeah, sadly, yes.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.440
-I see. -Not by choice.

13:20.480 --> 13:23.320
So, you were saying, you think it was

13:20.480 --> 13:23.320
someone he knew.

13:23.680 --> 13:25.800
But he didn't know anyone on the island.

13:25.840 --> 13:27.880
Yeah, well, we're yet to establish that.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.480
Look at that poor kid.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.240
To lose both parents so young.

13:33.560 --> 13:35.000
HUMPHREY: Oh, his mother?

13:35.040 --> 13:37.920
Yeah, she died in a car crash when he was 10.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.120
Sorry. If you'll excuse me, he needs me.

13:41.160 --> 13:42.360
Yes, of course.

13:45.600 --> 13:48.240
Strange, isn't it? He came to help

13:48.280 --> 13:51.400
but wasn't staying at the villa

13:48.280 --> 13:51.400
or helping at the restaurant.

13:51.440 --> 13:53.680
Yes, he's also short of an alibi.

13:54.320 --> 13:57.120
Let's find out everything we can

13:54.320 --> 13:57.120
about the two brothers.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.720
Right! JP, last night's diners,

13:58.000 --> 14:00.720
track them down. See if anyone

14:00.760 --> 14:03.480
spotted anything unusual.

14:03.520 --> 14:05.960
Also, ask around in town if anyone knew Robert,

14:06.000 --> 14:09.720
saw Robert, or can tell us anything

14:06.000 --> 14:09.720
about the victim's last day.

14:10.040 --> 14:12.840
Dwayne, search the villa and get CCTV,

14:12.880 --> 14:15.520
also put the feelers out for the phone,

14:12.880 --> 14:15.520
see if anything turns up.

14:15.560 --> 14:18.960
Florence, background checks and all mobile phone logs.

14:19.480 --> 14:21.960
'Cause Robert was murdered by someone he knew,

14:22.000 --> 14:26.240
and if it is as they all say and he knows

14:22.000 --> 14:26.240
no one on the island,

14:27.080 --> 14:29.960
well, then, it must be one of them.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.920
Okay, so there are two CCTV cameras at the villa.

14:37.200 --> 14:39.880
Both set at diagonals, one covering

14:37.200 --> 14:39.880
the whole of the front,

14:39.920 --> 14:41.320
the other the whole of the back.

14:41.360 --> 14:44.240
Now, they went in at 11:50 p.m.

14:44.280 --> 14:46.480
and came out at 8:00 the following morning.

14:46.520 --> 14:48.720
And there's no other way in or out of there?

14:48.760 --> 14:50.400
Not unless they dug a tunnel.

14:50.480 --> 14:52.960
This is a new-build. There are no cellars

14:50.480 --> 14:52.960
and no trap doors.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.120
Okay, let's make sure we go through

14:53.000 --> 14:56.120
every frame of this footage.

14:56.160 --> 14:58.120
-Yes, Chief. -Coroner just confirmed,

14:58.160 --> 15:00.200
there's no fingerprints on the knife.

15:00.240 --> 15:03.040
The post-mortem's preliminary report

15:00.240 --> 15:03.040
has just come back.

15:03.440 --> 15:05.640
Determining time of death is tricky,

15:05.680 --> 15:08.640
due to the body's exposure to extreme cold,

15:05.680 --> 15:08.640
as we thought.

15:08.720 --> 15:10.360
They're looking to come back to us

15:10.400 --> 15:12.560
with more specifics within the next day or so.

15:13.200 --> 15:15.240
Anything else from the restaurant?

15:15.280 --> 15:17.480
DWAYNE: Not really, no sign of his phone yet.

15:17.680 --> 15:20.760
The washing machine had the chef whites in,

15:17.680 --> 15:20.760
all washed.

15:20.800 --> 15:22.720
There was nothing significant on his desk.

15:22.760 --> 15:24.520
Paperwork, accounts.

15:24.560 --> 15:28.760
Different drafts of menus. Ah, but there was

15:24.560 --> 15:28.760
one thing, Chief.

15:30.200 --> 15:33.000
WED and a reference number.

15:33.040 --> 15:37.480
-Yes, very good.

15:37.640 --> 15:39.880
Call them, see if there's anything

15:37.640 --> 15:39.880
waiting to be collected.

15:39.920 --> 15:42.960
-Yes, Chief. -Okay,

15:39.920 --> 15:42.960
so what have we got so far?

15:43.160 --> 15:46.480
Ah, well, Robert Holt, 48.

15:46.880 --> 15:49.960
Maverick and star of the British culinary scene.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.760
Ran his first restaurant at the age of 21.

15:52.960 --> 15:55.960
"At Le Calmar, Saint-Marie, we don't serve food,

15:56.000 --> 15:58.080
"we serve up a Caribbean experience.

15:58.960 --> 16:04.880
"Timeless ingredients, memories, desires,

15:58.960 --> 16:04.880
aromas, textures, dreams."

16:04.920 --> 16:06.720
And a whole heap of cheese by the sound of it.

16:06.760 --> 16:08.640
Yes, quite. Ooh!

16:08.680 --> 16:11.400
Desserts, my favourite. Caribbean Shipwreck.

16:11.720 --> 16:16.200
"Praline and chocolate cliffs served on an archipelago

16:11.720 --> 16:16.200
of burnt almonds

16:16.240 --> 16:18.480
"in a lake of paw-paw-infused rosewater."

16:18.520 --> 16:20.040
Caribbean Shipwreck?

16:20.160 --> 16:22.080
What the hell are you supposed

16:20.160 --> 16:22.080
to do with that?

16:22.120 --> 16:24.960
Eat it or alert the Coast Guard?

16:25.360 --> 16:28.240
Oh, no, not you, madam. I wonder if you could help me?

16:29.440 --> 16:30.720
Anouk Laban.

16:30.760 --> 16:32.480
FLORENCE: Robert's girlfriend for 11 years.

16:32.760 --> 16:36.000
-Former fashion model. -Who never graduated to wife.

16:36.760 --> 16:39.280
Maybe everything is not a bed of paw-paw-infused rosewater

16:39.320 --> 16:41.600
in that relationship? Dexter Allen.

16:41.640 --> 16:44.240
FLORENCE: Sous chef and right-hand man.

16:41.640 --> 16:44.240
Married with a child.

16:44.640 --> 16:47.280
Been with Robert almost his entire career.

16:47.640 --> 16:50.480
Yet never tried to set up on his own?

16:47.640 --> 16:50.480
Why's that, I wonder?

16:50.560 --> 16:52.520
Matt Holt, son of the great man.

16:52.560 --> 16:55.960
Twenty. His mother was Robert's first,

16:52.560 --> 16:55.960
well, only wife.

16:56.200 --> 16:58.960
Died in a car crash when Matt was 10 years old.

16:59.400 --> 17:02.440
Matt was a grade-A student who dropped out of law school.

17:02.800 --> 17:06.520
Avid amateur photographer, according to his social media.

17:06.680 --> 17:09.920
And yet, working as a pot-washer

17:06.680 --> 17:09.920
for his old man. Interesting.

17:10.520 --> 17:12.400
Now, she was very quiet.

17:12.840 --> 17:15.560
-Which compensated for her tattoos.

17:12.840 --> 17:15.560
-FLORENCE: The pastry chef.

17:15.640 --> 17:17.440
Kim Sweeney, a Londoner.

17:17.480 --> 17:20.800
Got an apprenticeship in one of Robert's kitchens

17:17.480 --> 17:20.800
when she was 17.

17:20.840 --> 17:23.120
Rose through the ranks in no time.

17:23.160 --> 17:24.840
Let's try and look into her background.

17:24.880 --> 17:26.400
All right.

17:26.440 --> 17:30.360
Thank you very much, Anastena. Yes, bye-bye.

17:30.720 --> 17:33.960
Chief, there is indeed a package

17:30.720 --> 17:33.960
waiting to be picked up.

17:34.280 --> 17:37.040
Special delivery from London. I'm heading over there now.

17:37.200 --> 17:38.800
FLORENCE: I'll take over the footage.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.800
Which leaves us with the man with no alibi,

17:40.840 --> 17:44.000
-Gary Holt. -Well, he's a businessman,

17:40.840 --> 17:44.000
all right.

17:44.040 --> 17:47.120
Looks like he's got a string of failed ventures behind him.

17:47.160 --> 17:51.320
Was just declared bankrupt and latest divorce

17:47.160 --> 17:51.320
recently out of court.

17:51.360 --> 17:52.720
Any trouble with the law?

17:54.560 --> 17:57.160
Sounds like JP. JP, what news?

17:57.200 --> 17:59.440
Well, I asked everywhere.

17:59.520 --> 18:01.880
Everyone's heard of Robert but no one has met him.

18:01.920 --> 18:05.000
Seems he really did keep himself to

18:01.920 --> 18:05.000
the restaurant and the villa.

18:05.080 --> 18:07.400
But I do have this.

18:07.880 --> 18:11.760
Two of the diners attempted to film Robert at work.

18:07.880 --> 18:11.760
This is the footage.

18:17.720 --> 18:20.600
<i>-No photographs!</i> -ANOUK: <i> I'm sorry, I did say.</i>

18:20.840 --> 18:23.160
Well, I daresay in the midst of a first night,

18:23.200 --> 18:25.240
someone sticking a camera in your face,

18:25.480 --> 18:26.560
I wouldn't like it either.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.080
-Yes.

18:28.120 --> 18:30.360
-Gary Holt. He's got a criminal record.

18:28.120 --> 18:30.360
-Ah.

18:30.760 --> 18:33.120
Spent two years at HMP Woodhill.

18:33.160 --> 18:34.960
Serious assault outside a nightclub.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.480
And listen to this, six weeks ago,

18:35.000 --> 18:38.480
he's involved in a fight

18:38.520 --> 18:42.160
inside Robert's restaurant in London and was given

18:38.520 --> 18:42.160
a police caution.

18:42.560 --> 18:45.000
No wonder Robert didn't want him around.

18:45.040 --> 18:46.840
He sounds like a liability.

18:46.880 --> 18:50.240
Quite. JP, let's start going through Robert's laptop,

18:46.880 --> 18:50.240
emails, the lot,

18:50.280 --> 18:51.960
see if there's any mention of Gary in there.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.760
Yes, Chief.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.840
I think it's time we paid the helpful brother

18:53.800 --> 18:56.840
a helpful visit.

19:01.880 --> 19:04.400
-Ooh! What the... -Potholes.

19:04.800 --> 19:07.400
This is a great big piece of British engineering, Florence,

19:07.440 --> 19:09.600
it was built for potholes, you don't need to avoid them.

19:10.040 --> 19:11.720
So, I will tell you something, though.

19:11.760 --> 19:13.640
This was a very nasty assault that Gary went to prison for.

19:14.160 --> 19:16.000
The guy was left for dead.

19:16.200 --> 19:17.400
Now, you see,

19:18.040 --> 19:21.480
the victim of the assault pointed the finger

19:18.040 --> 19:21.480
at Robert, not Gary.

19:21.520 --> 19:24.080
Robert was charged but then Gary confessed.

19:24.520 --> 19:27.520
And the CPS concluded that because the victim

19:27.560 --> 19:29.280
was drunk at the time of the assault,

19:29.320 --> 19:31.720
they had to go with it and prosecuted Gary.

19:32.240 --> 19:35.680
-He was only 20 at the time. -So, Gary took

19:32.240 --> 19:35.680
a hit for his brother?

19:35.720 --> 19:37.760
Yes, it certainly looks that way. Oh!

19:38.960 --> 19:41.160
You did say I don't have to avoid them.

19:42.240 --> 19:45.720
Yes. Yes, that I did.

19:59.880 --> 20:01.800
I never need an excuse for a barbecue.

20:03.800 --> 20:06.400
I was wondering when you might show up.

20:06.440 --> 20:07.760
Let's start with the argument you had

20:07.800 --> 20:09.680
in the restaurant in London, six weeks ago.

20:10.160 --> 20:11.440
What was that about?

20:11.720 --> 20:14.840
Ah, you know, this and that. I can't remember, really.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.480
-I had a few drinks. -Still.

20:16.520 --> 20:18.920
It must have been serious if the police were called.

20:19.040 --> 20:20.960
Well, we exchanged a few blows.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.480
We both have a very short fuse.

20:23.760 --> 20:27.040
Yes, you've been through a rocky patch recently.

20:27.080 --> 20:28.680
Bankruptcy, divorce.

20:29.080 --> 20:33.560
Was that what you argued over

20:34.160 --> 20:35.360
Did he refuse?

20:35.800 --> 20:37.360
After all you did for him?

20:39.520 --> 20:40.600
You, um,

20:41.960 --> 20:43.720
spent two years in prison.

20:45.280 --> 20:47.600
Why did you confess to a crime you didn't commit?

20:48.720 --> 20:50.320
Who says I didn't commit it?

20:50.360 --> 20:52.680
Well, the entire investigative team,

20:50.360 --> 20:52.680
by the looks of it.

20:53.600 --> 20:57.000
Why did you take the charge for him, hmm?

20:57.040 --> 20:58.240
All right, let's see.

20:58.680 --> 21:00.520
How old must Robert have been at the time?

21:00.560 --> 21:02.680
Just about to go to catering school, right?

21:02.720 --> 21:05.360
Is that why

21:05.480 --> 21:07.840
Now he's a very successful millionaire

21:05.480 --> 21:07.840
and you're...

21:07.880 --> 21:09.200
So?

21:09.240 --> 21:11.360
What, you think I killed him over money?

21:12.000 --> 21:13.560
Well, then how do you explain this?

21:16.640 --> 21:17.600
Yesterday,

21:18.080 --> 21:20.840
he transferred £20,000 into my account.

21:21.720 --> 21:24.200
See, he may have been a lot of things

21:24.240 --> 21:25.960
but he was still my brother.

21:30.240 --> 21:33.680
So, 11:30 p.m. comes, the staff leave in a taxi.

21:33.720 --> 21:37.120
Confirmed by the taxi driver, who saw Robert wave them off.

21:37.160 --> 21:38.160
Correct.

21:38.800 --> 21:41.040
Now, Robert doesn't pull out the sofa bed

21:41.080 --> 21:42.640
but he does change.

21:42.680 --> 21:44.480
Because he put his chef's uniform

21:42.680 --> 21:44.480
in the washing machine.

21:44.520 --> 21:47.320
So it looks like that's when the attacker came,

21:47.520 --> 21:48.880
seeing as the bed's not slept in.

21:49.760 --> 21:53.240
And yet, the only suspect with the opportunity, Gary,

21:53.680 --> 21:55.760
has no motive.

21:55.800 --> 21:57.760
How are you getting on with the CCTV?

21:57.840 --> 21:59.080
Nearly done.

21:59.160 --> 22:01.800
Since they entered the villa at 11:50 p.m.,

22:01.920 --> 22:03.800
no movement at all.

22:05.360 --> 22:07.880
JP, anything your end on Robert's finances?

22:07.920 --> 22:12.000
Yes, evidence of multiple bank accounts

22:07.920 --> 22:12.000
in multiple places.

22:12.080 --> 22:13.720
HUMPHREY: Interesting.

22:13.760 --> 22:15.960
While we're at it, can we run financial checks on the rest?

22:16.120 --> 22:17.840
-Chief. -Ah, Dwayne.

22:17.880 --> 22:20.600
-You have been gone a long time.

22:17.880 --> 22:20.600
-Tell me about it.

22:20.800 --> 22:23.600
I had to wait for ages because of this.

22:24.200 --> 22:27.120
"For collection in person with ID only."

22:28.440 --> 22:29.960
It was in a special pile.

22:30.760 --> 22:34.240
And the lovely Anastena had to get

22:30.760 --> 22:34.240
special dispensation

22:34.280 --> 22:36.520
from her supervisor before I could leave.

22:36.560 --> 22:38.080
Yes, I bet that took a while.

22:38.120 --> 22:39.280
Burbank &amp; Co.

22:39.520 --> 22:40.880
That's his solicitor's firm.

22:41.400 --> 22:44.040
Now I can see why they were for collection only.

22:48.120 --> 22:51.720
Anouk Laban and Pierre Lovell, 10th of the 1st, 2016.

22:52.040 --> 22:53.680
She was having an affair?

22:53.720 --> 22:55.560
Well, there's a letter here as well

22:53.720 --> 22:55.560
from the solicitor.

22:56.080 --> 22:58.480
Pierre Lovell is a restaurateur.

22:58.880 --> 23:02.560
He owns quite a few places in Paris, London and Beijing.

23:02.680 --> 23:04.680
Mmm-hmm. Listen to this.

23:04.720 --> 23:08.280
"If an employee is seen or heard to pass on future plans,

23:04.720 --> 23:08.280
recipes, techniques,

23:08.320 --> 23:12.800
"then there is possibly a case for industrial espionage."

23:17.720 --> 23:19.480
Private investigators?

23:21.360 --> 23:24.440
I wouldn't have thought that was Elliot Burbank's

23:21.360 --> 23:24.440
style.

23:26.800 --> 23:28.480
Pierre's an old friend.

23:28.520 --> 23:30.800
But I think Robert suspected it was

23:28.520 --> 23:30.800
more business than pleasure.

23:32.520 --> 23:34.880
Industrial espionage?

23:35.320 --> 23:36.720
Please.

23:36.760 --> 23:38.360
That's Robert in a nutshell,

23:38.400 --> 23:40.640
always thinking people are trying

23:38.400 --> 23:40.640
to stab him in the back.

23:40.680 --> 23:41.960
To be fair, someone did.

23:43.280 --> 23:45.040
Well, it wasn't me.

23:45.080 --> 23:46.320
I had nothing to sell.

23:46.360 --> 23:47.720
You were meeting a restaurateur.

23:47.760 --> 23:50.720
Look, what was I supposed to be doing?

23:50.920 --> 23:52.960
I left an amazing career for Robert,

23:53.000 --> 23:55.120
I gave up the best years of my life.

23:55.160 --> 23:57.280
But I had no legal right to anything here.

23:57.320 --> 24:00.000
I mean, if we split up, I'd be left with nothing.

24:00.040 --> 24:03.920
No, Pierre was just giving me some kindly advice.

24:04.120 --> 24:07.120
-No.

24:08.320 --> 24:11.440
Marriage was a complete no-no for him.

24:11.560 --> 24:14.200
He once said, "Once is enough."

24:15.280 --> 24:17.120
That was fine.

24:17.560 --> 24:19.160
Fine.

24:19.520 --> 24:21.040
I did my best to keep him entertained

24:21.080 --> 24:24.120
but, um, he had a very low boredom threshold.

24:25.200 --> 24:27.280
He was a man, at the end of the day.

24:27.320 --> 24:29.240
We're not all like that.

24:29.280 --> 24:32.520
It was only a question of time before he shacked up

24:29.280 --> 24:32.520
with a younger model,

24:32.560 --> 24:34.080
literally.

24:34.120 --> 24:35.200
And then, where would I be?

24:35.240 --> 24:36.920
And yet, still you stayed with him.

24:36.960 --> 24:38.520
The option being...

24:40.120 --> 24:42.720
What

24:43.000 --> 24:44.040
You know,

24:44.680 --> 24:47.640
it's very apt that he called his restaurant Le Calmar,

24:47.680 --> 24:50.040
because he had his tentacles everywhere.

24:50.880 --> 24:54.640
Knowing him, he'd make damn sure no one could lay

24:50.880 --> 24:54.640
a hand on what was his,

24:54.960 --> 24:56.440
even from beyond the grave.

24:57.040 --> 25:01.280
No, I'd never be so stupid as to attempt his murder.

25:01.520 --> 25:03.880
Anyway, how could I?

25:04.920 --> 25:06.920
I was here all night.

25:09.560 --> 25:10.920
HUMPHREY: It's quite a relationship.

25:10.960 --> 25:12.160
He's looking to get rid of her,

25:12.200 --> 25:14.880
she knows he is, yet still holding on.

25:16.080 --> 25:18.800
Still, if she got rid of him first,

25:18.840 --> 25:21.760
I reckon she'd still have a claim

25:18.840 --> 25:21.760
to some of his wealth.

25:22.080 --> 25:24.040
But she couldn't have done it.

25:24.080 --> 25:27.280
The taxi driver said specifically that he took them

25:24.080 --> 25:27.280
straight to the villa.

25:27.320 --> 25:28.880
And I've looked at all the footage

25:28.920 --> 25:31.080
and there's no way anyone got out

25:28.920 --> 25:31.080
during the night.

25:31.120 --> 25:33.320
Where there's a motive, there's a way.

25:34.920 --> 25:37.120
Well, how are you two getting on?

25:37.280 --> 25:39.720
Well, just going through the evidence

25:37.280 --> 25:39.720
back from the villa.

25:39.760 --> 25:41.240
Nothing so far.

25:41.320 --> 25:44.520
Yes, I'm still trying to work out

25:41.320 --> 25:44.520
this financial maze.

25:44.720 --> 25:47.000
I mean, this chef must have kept

25:44.720 --> 25:47.000
his accountant busy. His bank accounts

25:47.040 --> 25:49.320
have bank accounts.

25:52.360 --> 25:54.440
Sammy

25:54.920 --> 25:56.240
You found the phone?

25:57.040 --> 25:58.120
Really?

25:58.760 --> 25:59.800
Okay, thank you.

26:00.800 --> 26:03.240
One of my informers has just come across

26:00.800 --> 26:03.240
somebody trying to sell

26:03.280 --> 26:06.080
what sounds like the chef's phone

26:03.280 --> 26:06.080
at the bus station.

26:09.440 --> 26:11.040
They don't call him Blind Sammy

26:09.440 --> 26:11.040
for nothing, you know.

26:11.080 --> 26:12.960
-Yes.

26:13.160 --> 26:14.720
But he's got exceptional hearing.

26:14.760 --> 26:16.280
Whatever works. Let's go.

26:22.480 --> 26:23.600
Madam.

26:43.840 --> 26:45.480
You need a phone?

26:45.520 --> 26:46.680
Hey!

26:48.840 --> 26:50.440
Chief! The kid!

26:58.440 --> 26:59.560
Oi!

27:13.240 --> 27:15.320
Hello.

27:15.360 --> 27:17.400
I hear you've got a phone for sale.

27:20.040 --> 27:22.360
JACKSON: I told you, someone gave it to me.

27:22.400 --> 27:24.080
-Can't remember.

27:24.120 --> 27:25.440
-Not sure.

27:25.480 --> 27:27.440
You're in big trouble, you know, Jackson.

27:27.480 --> 27:28.720
What will your parents say about this?

27:28.960 --> 27:32.640
Not much. They died when I was three.

27:32.680 --> 27:34.160
My aunty looks after me.

27:34.280 --> 27:36.480
But she's asleep because she works nights.

27:36.760 --> 27:38.720
Puts me out of the house in the daytime.

27:38.760 --> 27:41.760
Now, listen, Jackson. This is very serious.

27:42.240 --> 27:43.560
A man has been murdered.

27:43.680 --> 27:45.160
And this was his phone.

27:46.560 --> 27:50.000
Now, for the last time, how did you get it?

27:50.080 --> 27:51.480
Will I get into trouble?

27:51.520 --> 27:52.640
Not if you tell the truth.

27:53.040 --> 27:55.760
Well, I was outside that new restaurant,

27:55.800 --> 27:57.600
the one with the octopus sign on it.

27:57.760 --> 27:59.120
-Yesterday morning.

27:59.240 --> 28:00.600
And I was walking on the beach.

28:00.920 --> 28:03.320
<i>Sometimes people leave behind</i> <i>nice things.</i>

28:03.560 --> 28:06.080
<i>And these two men came</i> <i>and started fighting.</i>

28:06.440 --> 28:08.120
<i>They were arguing.</i>

28:08.160 --> 28:09.800
<i>And then the older</i> <i>man's phone fell out</i>

28:08.160 --> 28:09.800
<i>of his pocket.</i>

28:09.840 --> 28:11.720
<i>But he doesn't notice.</i>

28:11.760 --> 28:15.520
<i>He's so angry, he just pushed</i> <i>the other man</i>

28:11.760 --> 28:15.520
<i>and goes back in.</i>

28:15.560 --> 28:17.800
The other man gets up looking really upset

28:18.080 --> 28:19.120
and goes in right after him.

28:19.360 --> 28:20.760
So what were they arguing about?

28:20.800 --> 28:22.200
I didn't understand.

28:22.320 --> 28:23.880
Something about girlfriends.

28:24.200 --> 28:25.440
Girlfriends?

28:26.240 --> 28:27.160
Jackson.

28:27.640 --> 28:30.600
The man who lost his phone, was it him?

28:30.640 --> 28:34.040
-Yeah. -And the man he

28:30.640 --> 28:34.040
was fighting with,

28:35.120 --> 28:36.040
him?

28:38.400 --> 28:40.400
-No.

28:40.640 --> 28:42.840
It was him, with the sad eyes.

28:45.840 --> 28:49.160
Very little we can add to what we know

28:45.840 --> 28:49.160
about Matt already.

28:49.480 --> 28:50.720
No criminal record.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.800
Dropped out of law school despite his great grades.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.240
Didn't pick up his place on a photography course.

28:56.440 --> 28:57.880
Nothing from the villa, either.

28:57.960 --> 29:02.240
Meanwhile, on his blog, he posted a strange wishlist.

29:02.280 --> 29:03.600
HUMPHREY: Jewellery?

29:04.040 --> 29:06.200
Jackson said girlfriends were mentioned.

29:04.040 --> 29:06.200
Does he have one?

29:06.240 --> 29:07.360
Doesn't look like it.

29:07.400 --> 29:10.920
His online profile says single.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.600
Doesn't take after his father, then.

29:13.640 --> 29:17.000
Well, whatever they were arguing about,

29:13.640 --> 29:17.000
he never mentioned it.

29:17.040 --> 29:20.280
There's only one way to find out why.

29:17.040 --> 29:20.280
Back in the Jeep.

29:24.920 --> 29:28.040
I should have said. I feel so awful about it.

29:29.600 --> 29:30.880
That was the last time we spoke.

29:31.440 --> 29:32.760
What were you arguing about?

29:32.800 --> 29:35.520
We haven't been getting along for a while.

29:36.240 --> 29:38.000
Since I dropped out of my law degree.

29:38.040 --> 29:40.600
He wouldn't pay for me to go to photography school.

29:40.640 --> 29:42.320
He said if I wanted to throw my life away,

29:42.360 --> 29:44.400
then I'd have to pay for the privilege myself.

29:44.440 --> 29:47.200
Yet still you chose to come work here

29:44.440 --> 29:47.200
as a pot

29:47.320 --> 29:49.120
Why not just go somewhere else?

29:49.480 --> 29:51.160
I suppose I...

29:52.520 --> 29:55.200
-I thought I could change his mind.

29:52.520 --> 29:55.200
-But you didn't.

29:55.240 --> 29:58.600
That's what started it all. We went for a swim.

29:59.760 --> 30:02.680
And then on the way back I said to him,

30:02.840 --> 30:05.960
"Why don't you pay for my course upfront

30:02.840 --> 30:05.960
and I'll pay you back?"

30:06.240 --> 30:07.840
And then he let rip.

30:07.880 --> 30:10.840
<i>Called me a loser</i> <i>and a disappointment.</i>

30:12.240 --> 30:13.360
And...

30:15.200 --> 30:16.840
...it kind of went from there.

30:18.440 --> 30:20.880
I wasn't exactly a match for him physically.

30:21.680 --> 30:23.240
He knew that.

30:23.280 --> 30:26.960
You were overheard having an argument

30:23.280 --> 30:26.960
about girlfriends.

30:27.720 --> 30:29.440
Girlfriends?

30:30.480 --> 30:31.600
Uh...

30:33.600 --> 30:35.000
My dad's girlfriends.

30:35.040 --> 30:37.480
I don't like the way he treats Anouk,

30:35.040 --> 30:37.480
that's all.

30:37.600 --> 30:38.720
Right.

30:39.360 --> 30:41.080
That scratch, it's nasty.

30:41.640 --> 30:43.000
That happen in the...

30:43.040 --> 30:46.040
Oh, no. I, um...

30:46.080 --> 30:48.160
...get eczema when I get stressed.

30:48.400 --> 30:50.040
GARY: What the hell is going on?

30:51.800 --> 30:53.560
Have a word, please?

30:53.960 --> 30:55.880
In private, downstairs.

31:01.480 --> 31:03.120
Distress a kid who's just lost his father?

31:03.160 --> 31:05.240
Look, new evidence has come to light

31:03.160 --> 31:05.240
about an argument.

31:05.280 --> 31:06.400
So, they argued.

31:06.720 --> 31:08.600
You show me a father and son who don't.

31:08.640 --> 31:11.560
You need to lay off him. He's more

31:08.640 --> 31:11.560
fragile than he looks.

31:11.600 --> 31:15.280
-We were just trying... -Do you have

31:11.600 --> 31:15.280
anything tangible on him?

31:16.280 --> 31:18.880
No, of course you don't. And you wouldn't, either,

31:18.920 --> 31:21.320
because he was here all night.

31:22.680 --> 31:24.240
So I think we're done here.

31:25.880 --> 31:27.080
Don't you?

31:33.600 --> 31:36.800
Are we digging up everything we can

31:33.600 --> 31:36.800
about Robert and Dexter?

31:36.840 --> 31:38.840
-Yeah. I'm on it, Chief. -Thank you.

31:38.880 --> 31:41.080
Dwayne, how are we getting on with Robert Holt's mobile?

31:41.120 --> 31:43.080
Well, I'm going through his call register.

31:43.120 --> 31:44.360
Nothing so far.

31:44.560 --> 31:46.920
Calls to his lawyer, his bank, that sort of thing.

31:47.120 --> 31:49.840
I think I'm going to take it home.

31:47.120 --> 31:49.840
This could take me all night.

31:50.120 --> 31:53.320
Well, I would help you out but I got a date

31:50.120 --> 31:53.320
with the Inspector.

31:53.640 --> 31:56.000
Movie night. Fancy joining us?

31:59.240 --> 32:01.480
Yeah, you stick to your date and I'll stick to my data,

32:01.520 --> 32:02.960
thank you very much.

32:10.640 --> 32:13.080
Well, hold on, darling, look, say something.

32:19.200 --> 32:20.360
That little...

32:21.080 --> 32:22.280
Again?

32:44.080 --> 32:45.280
Jackson here?

33:08.960 --> 33:10.800
Can't we just watch it on a DVD player?

33:10.840 --> 33:16.520
No, we want to have the full big-screen experience.

33:18.440 --> 33:19.640
Ah.

33:20.320 --> 33:22.680
-Yes, um... -Here.

33:30.400 --> 33:32.280
Yes. Excellent.

33:32.320 --> 33:34.400
Anyway, right. I think that's everything.

33:34.440 --> 33:38.200
Now, the DVD player is hooked up

33:34.440 --> 33:38.200
to the computer,

33:38.240 --> 33:40.240
computer to the projector, projector to the battery,

33:40.280 --> 33:43.240
which is charging in the extension cable.

33:43.800 --> 33:45.080
Well, that's it.

33:45.640 --> 33:47.920
Ladies and gentlemen, take your seats.

33:48.560 --> 33:49.600
Lights!

33:49.760 --> 33:50.920
Camera! Toaster?

33:54.280 --> 33:55.880
Right.

33:56.120 --> 33:58.120
I think I know what I did wrong there.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.600
<i></i>

34:06.400 --> 34:08.720
Oh, yes.

34:08.760 --> 34:10.040
That's good, that's very good.

34:13.120 --> 34:14.440
Very good.

34:19.480 --> 34:20.440
Good morning.

34:20.480 --> 34:22.000
-Morning. -Morning.

34:22.240 --> 34:24.600
So, how was the lesson?

34:24.640 --> 34:27.240
Well, actually, it was rather fascinating, wasn't it, JP?

34:30.160 --> 34:31.880
Well, um...

34:31.920 --> 34:34.800
One, love can be found anywhere.

34:35.920 --> 34:39.800
Uh, two, you can't force it.

34:40.320 --> 34:41.680
It's spontaneous.

34:41.720 --> 34:42.800
Wouldn't you say?

34:43.160 --> 34:45.360
-Uh, yes. -And three,

34:45.720 --> 34:47.120
once you have it,

34:48.480 --> 34:49.760
it's forever.

34:51.680 --> 34:54.000
-Yes. -FLORENCE: Dwayne.

34:56.120 --> 34:57.280
Okay.

34:58.600 --> 35:00.000
He's onto something.

35:02.560 --> 35:03.800
Look.

35:03.840 --> 35:05.920
These were all in his deleted messages file.

35:06.360 --> 35:08.960
Robert's been texting Dexter the whole time

35:06.360 --> 35:08.960
they've been here.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.040
Right. But Dexter's not been answering.

35:11.160 --> 35:14.040
Look. "What have they got over in SH?"

35:14.480 --> 35:16.120
"SH comes highly recommended."

35:16.160 --> 35:17.840
"What's the weather like in SH?"

35:17.880 --> 35:19.080
SH?

35:19.480 --> 35:21.640
You know, and if none of them have received a response,

35:21.680 --> 35:23.440
then, what were they, jokes?

35:23.480 --> 35:25.600
A taunt

35:25.640 --> 35:28.840
Wait, hang on. We found these

35:25.640 --> 35:28.840
in Dexter's bin.

35:29.160 --> 35:31.800
Ticket stubs for the ferry to Saint-Helene.

35:32.160 --> 35:33.240
Saint

35:33.280 --> 35:35.120
SH. It has to be that.

35:35.280 --> 35:37.960
Look, why don't we just go over to Saint-Helene and

35:35.280 --> 35:37.960
see what we can dig up?

35:38.000 --> 35:39.240
Yeah. Good idea.

35:41.240 --> 35:43.720
JP: If I tell you, it won't be a surprise.

35:45.160 --> 35:47.080
Hang up the phone. No, you hang...

35:47.120 --> 35:48.840
I tell you what, I'll hang up.

35:49.320 --> 35:50.600
You're on duty, man.

35:50.920 --> 35:53.240
Well, you're the one who put the fear of God in me.

35:53.280 --> 35:54.680
-Yes.

35:54.720 --> 35:56.640
-Telling me how to top her gestures.

35:54.720 --> 35:56.640
-Oh.

35:57.120 --> 35:59.840
So have you worked out how you're going to do that yet?

35:59.920 --> 36:01.440
It's going to be amazing.

36:05.720 --> 36:08.280
He said he was a bit of a regular

36:05.720 --> 36:08.280
on the evening ferry.

36:09.200 --> 36:10.280
FLORENCE: I found this.

36:10.320 --> 36:12.680
An interview in the <i> Hackney Gazette.</i>

36:12.720 --> 36:16.960
"Local boy chosen as one of five

36:12.720 --> 36:16.960
culinary stars of tomorrow."

36:17.520 --> 36:19.680
He had just got his job at Robert's restaurant.

36:19.720 --> 36:21.720
Yeah, look.

36:21.760 --> 36:24.120
"'The plan is to stay here for a couple of years,

36:21.760 --> 36:24.120
then branch out on my own.

36:24.160 --> 36:25.840
"'I'm not made to be number two.'

36:25.960 --> 36:28.720
"One of five chefs who won the coveted

36:25.960 --> 36:28.720
Stars of Tomorrow."

36:29.160 --> 36:32.640
Well, he was certainly good enough.

36:29.160 --> 36:32.640
So why hasn't he done it?

36:33.480 --> 36:34.920
Man, there's nothing.

36:35.320 --> 36:37.400
But there must have been a reason

36:35.320 --> 36:37.400
why he was here so often.

36:37.440 --> 36:39.920
Oh, there was. A certain bar.

36:40.960 --> 36:43.200
He was seen outside on quite a few nights.

36:43.240 --> 36:44.320
Yes?

36:44.360 --> 36:45.920
You've heard of Bastian's?

36:46.520 --> 36:47.680
Bastian's?

36:49.920 --> 36:51.640
The gay bar?

37:06.960 --> 37:09.800
He knew, didn't he? About Bastian's.

37:10.120 --> 37:11.320
What doesn't he know?

37:11.520 --> 37:13.640
There's not many gay bars on these islands.

37:14.040 --> 37:16.560
How long did he know about you?

37:16.600 --> 37:19.080
He worked it out pretty soon after

37:16.600 --> 37:19.080
I joined his ranks.

37:19.120 --> 37:20.840
See, he's very clever with people.

37:21.320 --> 37:24.080
He works his way slowly and methodically

37:21.320 --> 37:24.080
into your confidence

37:24.120 --> 37:28.520
until he's got something on you

37:24.120 --> 37:28.520
and then crushes you.

37:28.800 --> 37:32.280
We know he was taunting you, via text.

37:32.840 --> 37:34.400
Well, he never actually said anything.

37:34.800 --> 37:38.960
Not openly, anyway, but there were

37:34.800 --> 37:38.960
always these jibes,

37:39.320 --> 37:40.400
suggestions,

37:40.920 --> 37:44.560
constant mentions of the boys I work with, of Emily.

37:45.560 --> 37:47.880
He would say he must call her for a chat.

37:48.840 --> 37:50.480
It was just

37:50.520 --> 37:53.440
total and complete control at any price.

37:53.480 --> 37:55.880
The man was a sociopath.

37:57.800 --> 38:00.680
I do love them, more than anything.

38:01.320 --> 38:04.760
I mean, can you imagine the fallout,

38:01.320 --> 38:04.760
the hurt this would cause?

38:04.800 --> 38:06.320
They've done nothing wrong.

38:06.600 --> 38:08.720
Is that why you stayed working for him?

38:09.200 --> 38:11.920
Did he threaten to out you?

38:11.960 --> 38:13.200
Vile,

38:14.480 --> 38:15.680
horrible man.

38:19.680 --> 38:20.800
Don't be ridiculous.

38:20.840 --> 38:22.840
That's a pretty powerful motive, Dexter.

38:22.880 --> 38:24.280
I wish I had it in me.

38:24.880 --> 38:27.040
Don't get me wrong, I won't be

38:24.880 --> 38:27.040
shedding tears over him.

38:27.080 --> 38:28.400
But I didn't kill him.

38:29.160 --> 38:31.360
And how could I, anyway? I was in

38:29.160 --> 38:31.360
the villa the whole night.

38:35.480 --> 38:37.920
So Robert exploited his brother's loyalty,

38:37.960 --> 38:39.920
tried to get rid of his partner,

38:40.040 --> 38:42.960
blackmailed his sous chef and tyrannised his son.

38:43.000 --> 38:46.600
Yeah. One by one he bullied and alienated everyone.

38:46.640 --> 38:50.360
However, Matt, Anouk, Dexter and Kim

38:46.640 --> 38:50.360
were all at the villa.

38:50.400 --> 38:52.640
And he'd just made his peace with Gary

38:50.400 --> 38:52.640
the day before.

38:52.880 --> 38:56.000
So they couldn't do it and he had no reason to.

38:56.080 --> 38:57.120
Oh, my Lord.

38:57.560 --> 39:00.680
Wow. So, as well as the two accounts

38:57.560 --> 39:00.680
in Zurich,

39:00.720 --> 39:04.320
Robert had one in San Marino, one in the Cayman Islands

39:04.360 --> 39:05.720
and one in Liechtenstein.

39:05.760 --> 39:07.400
-Novel choice.

39:07.440 --> 39:09.400
Yes, but wait till you hear this.

39:09.440 --> 39:11.440
Once a month £3,000 gets transferred

39:11.480 --> 39:13.960
to a building society account in England

39:14.080 --> 39:17.240
in the name of Kim Sweeney.

39:21.040 --> 39:22.440
Is Kim available?

39:22.480 --> 39:24.640
She's not well, she's been in bed all day.

39:24.680 --> 39:27.080
We'll be very brief, I assure you. Thank you.

39:33.120 --> 39:34.200
Yeah.

39:34.240 --> 39:36.240
Well, he helped me out.

39:36.760 --> 39:39.680
My mum, she's got MS. I thought I was going to

39:40.520 --> 39:43.440
have to pack it all in to go and look after her.

39:43.480 --> 39:46.000
So, Robert was paying for nursing care

39:46.040 --> 39:48.040
so I could, you know, carry on.

39:48.520 --> 39:51.120
-Yeah. Five days ago.

39:51.160 --> 39:52.760
"Hope you like your presents."

39:52.840 --> 39:53.960
Kiss, kiss, kiss.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.960
It's my friend Ali from London.

39:56.960 --> 39:58.040
Anyway, you were saying?

39:58.080 --> 40:01.040
Was Robert that helpful to others, too?

40:02.000 --> 40:05.040
Because looking over his accounts,

40:02.000 --> 40:05.040
it doesn't seem so.

40:06.880 --> 40:11.840
Are you sure he, um, expected nothing in return?

40:13.280 --> 40:14.960
It wasn't like that.

40:15.160 --> 40:16.720
What was it like?

40:18.880 --> 40:20.480
He was an amazing man.

40:20.520 --> 40:23.720
Working next to him, it was... It was inspiring.

40:24.280 --> 40:26.440
He taught me everything I know.

40:34.240 --> 40:35.760
Okay.

40:38.680 --> 40:40.800
I slept with him.

40:42.360 --> 40:45.640
We had an affair or whatever you

40:42.360 --> 40:45.640
want to call it.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.040
Maybe I did feel indebted.

40:48.080 --> 40:50.200
I didn't know any better.

40:50.600 --> 40:52.600
It just happened.

40:52.640 --> 40:54.880
I knew it was never going to go anywhere.

40:54.920 --> 40:58.920
Look, everyone in this business

40:54.920 --> 40:58.920
cops off with each other,

40:58.960 --> 41:00.040
it's not rare.

41:00.520 --> 41:02.920
The hours are long.

41:02.960 --> 41:06.240
-You never get to meet anyone else.

41:06.400 --> 41:09.080
A while, on and off.

41:10.520 --> 41:12.520
Then it just sort of fizzled out.

41:12.600 --> 41:13.960
Fizzled out?

41:14.640 --> 41:16.320
That must have been difficult,

41:16.480 --> 41:18.960
seeing as you worked so closely together.

41:19.120 --> 41:20.920
I always knew it wouldn't last.

41:21.080 --> 41:23.800
Did Robert have the other half of that?

41:23.880 --> 41:24.960
What?

41:25.000 --> 41:26.200
The pendant.

41:26.960 --> 41:29.680
No. No, my mum does.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.640
Believe me,

41:35.480 --> 41:38.440
the only person Robert was in love with was Robert.

41:40.920 --> 41:42.960
Right, what do we know?

41:43.480 --> 41:45.800
Robert Holt was stabbed with his own knife

41:45.840 --> 41:48.200
the night before yesterday.

41:48.240 --> 41:52.120
He was last seen at 11:30 p.m. by his staff

41:48.240 --> 41:52.120
and a taxi driver.

41:52.520 --> 41:55.880
And we know he let his attacker in,

41:52.520 --> 41:55.880
so he must have known them.

41:56.280 --> 41:59.880
And we can't find anyone else he may have

41:56.280 --> 41:59.880
known on the island

41:59.920 --> 42:01.640
except these people.

42:01.720 --> 42:04.600
He betrayed his brother, cheated on his partner,

42:01.720 --> 42:04.600
bullied his son,

42:05.080 --> 42:07.200
blackmailed his second-in-command

42:07.240 --> 42:08.760
and took liberties with the pastry chef.

42:09.160 --> 42:12.000
Her story checks out, by the way.

42:09.160 --> 42:12.000
Her mum is in a nursing home

42:12.040 --> 42:15.320
and money goes from Kim's account

42:12.040 --> 42:15.320
every month to pay for it.

42:15.360 --> 42:16.680
-Hmm... -Well,

42:16.720 --> 42:18.480
none of them will miss him, that's for sure.

42:18.520 --> 42:20.440
And yet they were all in the villa

42:18.520 --> 42:20.440
at the time of the murder.

42:20.480 --> 42:22.080
FLORENCE: Apart from one, Gary.

42:22.120 --> 42:25.720
Who has no motive. No, no, no,

42:22.120 --> 42:25.720
this is impossible.

42:26.480 --> 42:29.520
I know it's right under our noses.

42:26.480 --> 42:29.520
I can smell it.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.920
Sir, can I just put something out there?

42:34.040 --> 42:36.440
Maybe it was a robbery.

42:36.480 --> 42:39.960
Maybe it was one of the diners and maybe

42:36.480 --> 42:39.960
they hid in the toilets

42:40.000 --> 42:41.320
till everyone was gone and...

42:41.360 --> 42:43.600
And how did they get out after they killed him?

42:44.560 --> 42:48.640
Okay, I haven't worked that out yet

42:44.560 --> 42:48.640
but it can't be one of these.

42:50.280 --> 42:53.280
Ah, the coroners. This is their

42:50.280 --> 42:53.280
follow-up report.

42:53.320 --> 42:55.360
Ah. It's...

42:55.400 --> 42:56.880
Ah.

42:58.200 --> 42:59.720
Right. Um...

43:01.920 --> 43:04.040
"Cardiac arrest caused by stabbing

43:01.920 --> 43:04.040
straight to the heart..."

43:04.080 --> 43:07.160
Etcetera, etcetera. "Time of death, inconclusive.

43:07.280 --> 43:11.360
"Please see appendix A below."

43:11.520 --> 43:12.720
Damn!

43:12.760 --> 43:14.640
They haven't managed to narrow it down.

43:14.880 --> 43:16.840
"Ambient temperature will make this a best guess

43:16.880 --> 43:19.000
"based on available information.

43:19.040 --> 43:24.320
"The time of death could realistically be any time

43:19.040 --> 43:24.320
within a 24-hour period."

43:24.520 --> 43:28.360
Yes, but seeing as he was last seen

43:24.520 --> 43:28.360
at 11:30 p.m...

43:28.400 --> 43:29.680
Hang on.

43:31.280 --> 43:32.360
No.

43:32.400 --> 43:35.880
How could I? I was here all night.

43:37.160 --> 43:39.200
Never mind. That was brilliant.

43:39.240 --> 43:42.960
Where is the footage from the opening?

43:39.240 --> 43:42.960
Where's the footage?

43:43.000 --> 43:44.480
Yes. Yes.

43:45.720 --> 43:46.880
Oh, my word.

43:48.280 --> 43:50.000
Oh, I can't believe it.

43:50.800 --> 43:54.040
This knife has been sharpened with a bias to

43:50.800 --> 43:54.040
the right-hand side.

43:54.520 --> 43:57.040
Oh, yes, that's very clever. Very.

43:58.440 --> 43:59.880
ANOUK: I'm sorry, I did say.

43:59.920 --> 44:02.000
I never need an excuse for a barbecue.

44:03.120 --> 44:04.880
Ah...

44:04.920 --> 44:07.360
-Something about girlfriends.

44:07.840 --> 44:10.200
Nearly. Nearly there.

44:12.400 --> 44:14.360
Right. I think I know what's going on.

44:14.400 --> 44:17.240
Dwayne, we need the CCTV footage from the

44:14.400 --> 44:17.240
arrivals hall of the airport

44:17.280 --> 44:18.320
for last Friday.

44:18.360 --> 44:21.360
Florence, JP, come with me.

44:24.200 --> 44:26.680
JP: Chief, I don't think there's anything

44:24.200 --> 44:26.680
here we can use.

44:26.720 --> 44:28.520
Just keep looking.

44:36.080 --> 44:37.240
What's that?

44:39.440 --> 44:42.200
Bingo. I think it's time we got everyone together.

44:44.400 --> 44:47.600
Le Calmar. The squid.

44:50.600 --> 44:54.000
Did you know that in 1998, marine biologists discovered

44:54.040 --> 44:58.560
a fascinating species of mollusc just off

44:54.040 --> 44:58.560
the coast of Indonesia?

44:58.600 --> 45:00.880
They called it the mimic octopus.

45:01.640 --> 45:04.960
Because it fools its predators by pretending to be

45:01.640 --> 45:04.960
something it's not.

45:06.200 --> 45:09.280
Sometimes it pretends to be a lionfish,

45:06.200 --> 45:09.280
sometimes a sea snake.

45:09.560 --> 45:12.520
It's very clever. An impersonator!

45:12.560 --> 45:14.240
Who put those there?

45:14.280 --> 45:16.720
Very similar to what we have

45:14.280 --> 45:16.720
encountered here.

45:17.080 --> 45:20.400
See, at first, it looked as if Robert Holt, uber-chef,

45:20.560 --> 45:24.680
huge talent, had been the victim

45:20.560 --> 45:24.680
of a botched burglary.

45:25.920 --> 45:27.480
He wasn't.

45:27.520 --> 45:31.200
He was murdered. Murdered by someone

45:27.520 --> 45:31.200
he knew very well.

45:31.520 --> 45:33.160
Murdered by someone here.

45:35.800 --> 45:36.840
Now, here's the problem.

45:36.880 --> 45:41.640
Now, four of you had a strong motive.

45:42.760 --> 45:44.280
Anouk.

45:44.520 --> 45:46.720
A dead Robert could give you what a living

45:44.520 --> 45:46.720
Robert never would,

45:46.880 --> 45:47.920
financial security.

45:48.200 --> 45:50.040
If we split up I'd be left with nothing.

45:50.600 --> 45:53.760
Matt Holt. You just wanted to

45:50.600 --> 45:53.760
follow your own path,

45:53.800 --> 45:55.560
against your father's will.

45:55.600 --> 45:56.880
<i>Is that a reason to kill?</i>

45:57.480 --> 45:59.840
Blood relatives have killed for less.

46:00.480 --> 46:03.240
Dexter Allen, you certainly had

46:00.480 --> 46:03.240
a motive for murder,

46:03.280 --> 46:04.920
you were being blackmailed.

46:05.360 --> 46:07.800
A hugely talented chef in his own right,

46:08.240 --> 46:11.280
Robert made sure that he'd never hop kitchen

46:11.320 --> 46:12.720
or set up on his own.

46:14.560 --> 46:18.320
And then there's Kim, the pastry chef.

46:20.480 --> 46:22.360
His one-time mistress.

46:23.520 --> 46:25.760
Someone else Robert used and abused.

46:27.880 --> 46:31.680
Gave her money and yet indulged in a highly

46:27.880 --> 46:31.680
inappropriate relationship.

46:32.360 --> 46:35.200
The only thing is she, along with the rest of you,

46:36.440 --> 46:37.520
had an alibi.

46:38.440 --> 46:40.400
You were all in the villa at the time of murder.

46:40.440 --> 46:44.040
In fact, the only person who wasn't in

46:40.440 --> 46:44.040
the villa was Gary Holt.

46:44.960 --> 46:48.640
Gary certainly had the opportunity,

46:44.960 --> 46:48.640
but where's the motive?

46:49.400 --> 46:51.440
I mean, after all, the day before he was killed,

46:51.480 --> 46:54.440
Robert gave him £20,000.

46:54.480 --> 46:57.320
So, how do we make sense of all this?

46:57.360 --> 46:59.040
We're waiting to hear.

46:59.320 --> 47:01.920
Yes. Yes.

47:10.200 --> 47:12.840
It's showtime. Dwayne.

47:14.320 --> 47:16.720
Now, this is footage taken by one of the diners

47:16.760 --> 47:18.240
on the night of the soft opening,

47:18.280 --> 47:20.200
not the catchiest of titles, but there you go.

47:20.960 --> 47:23.840
Now, it looks like we are watching

47:20.960 --> 47:23.840
Robert at work.

47:23.880 --> 47:26.160
-We are. -No, we're not.

47:26.720 --> 47:28.480
If you could slow it down here, please, Dwayne?

47:29.800 --> 47:32.160
Now, remember Robert is left-handed.

47:33.040 --> 47:35.120
A left-handed person would place the condiments

47:35.160 --> 47:37.440
to the right of the dish and then lean over.

47:37.720 --> 47:39.560
Putting the condiments to the left of the dish

47:39.600 --> 47:42.240
is exactly what a right-handed person

47:39.600 --> 47:42.240
would do.

47:42.760 --> 47:45.640
You see, Dexter notices this

47:46.280 --> 47:49.280
and so moves the bowls to the right.

47:49.640 --> 47:52.160
Just as the pair of them become aware

47:49.640 --> 47:52.160
that they're being filmed,

47:52.200 --> 47:54.320
I mean, naturally at the best of times,

47:54.360 --> 47:56.800
Robert wouldn't like being filmed

47:54.360 --> 47:56.800
without prior notice,

47:57.520 --> 47:59.560
but that's not the reason he panics here, no.

48:00.400 --> 48:01.720
The reason is...

48:03.240 --> 48:06.920
...Robert isn't Robert.

48:08.920 --> 48:10.160
That's insane.

48:13.240 --> 48:14.880
This is Gary Holt

48:15.080 --> 48:16.480
coming through the airport,

48:16.920 --> 48:18.880
the day he arrived on the island.

48:19.240 --> 48:21.240
HUMPHREY: All it required was a pair of glasses

48:22.400 --> 48:26.600
and Robert's trademark bandana and Gary becomes Robert.

48:27.760 --> 48:31.000
After all, apart from you lot, no one at

48:27.760 --> 48:31.000
the soft opening would,

48:31.040 --> 48:33.800
at a fair distance, know any different.

48:33.840 --> 48:36.000
Because by the time the diners sat down,

48:36.880 --> 48:38.400
Robert was already dead.

48:39.520 --> 48:41.720
-In the freezer. -That's crazy.

48:41.920 --> 48:43.640
We all thought

48:43.680 --> 48:46.400
that Robert was killed on the night

48:43.680 --> 48:46.400
of the soft opening.

48:46.440 --> 48:49.640
In fact, he was killed 12 hours before.

48:50.000 --> 48:53.160
You took a brazen risk but the rewards were high.

48:54.440 --> 48:57.160
It enabled you to shift the time of the murder

48:57.400 --> 48:59.960
and thereby give you all an alibi.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.840
I mean, if we think that Robert's killed

49:00.000 --> 49:02.840
in the middle of the night,

49:03.320 --> 49:06.240
well, then you're all safely tucked up

49:03.320 --> 49:06.240
inside the villa, aren't you?

49:06.280 --> 49:08.240
So Gary poses as Robert,

49:08.960 --> 49:11.040
Dexter does all the cooking.

49:11.600 --> 49:14.640
<i>Gary then makes</i> <i>sure the taxi driver</i>

49:11.600 --> 49:14.640
<i>sees him go back inside.</i>

49:15.160 --> 49:18.560
<i>And then he prepares the scene</i> <i>for the robbery gone wrong.</i>

49:18.720 --> 49:21.640
<i>All it takes then is a shave</i> <i>and you are Gary again.</i>

49:21.840 --> 49:23.440
This is ridiculous.

49:23.720 --> 49:26.640
What, I killed him and then impersonated him?

49:26.680 --> 49:29.960
It's funny you say that because you see, in my mind,

49:30.080 --> 49:33.880
once I worked out the how, I then had to

49:30.080 --> 49:33.880
work out the who.

49:34.560 --> 49:37.440
Now, there were two options. Option one, you killed him.

49:37.560 --> 49:39.480
But then, why would everyone else play along

49:39.920 --> 49:42.960
and conspire to protect you? After all,

49:39.920 --> 49:42.960
they hardly know you.

49:43.520 --> 49:46.080
Which leads us to option two.

49:47.280 --> 49:48.640
You and everyone else

49:49.440 --> 49:53.000
conspired to protect someone else.

49:53.640 --> 49:56.360
Someone you all knew and empathised with.

49:57.920 --> 50:02.720
Someone who had a very unfortunate

49:57.920 --> 50:02.720
roll of the dice so far.

50:03.040 --> 50:07.720
It's a rerun of the past, Gary.

50:03.040 --> 50:07.720
But for your brother's son.

50:08.040 --> 50:10.480
And what? We'd all just

50:08.040 --> 50:10.480
play along with it?

50:10.520 --> 50:12.400
Well, yes, you would.

50:13.080 --> 50:15.400
Because you all hated Robert.

50:16.240 --> 50:19.000
And you all felt empathy for Matt's plight.

50:20.200 --> 50:23.560
This had nothing to do with your dad's plans for you,

50:23.600 --> 50:25.880
however much you hated them.

50:27.800 --> 50:30.360
But it has everything to do with Kim,

50:31.240 --> 50:33.160
the woman you were passionately in love with,

50:33.200 --> 50:37.240
the woman who was your father's

50:33.200 --> 50:37.240
on-and-off mistress.

50:37.600 --> 50:40.280
Me and Matt? -Yes, of course.

50:41.240 --> 50:43.640
I mean, a sensitive, clever, slightly lost young man.

50:44.160 --> 50:46.640
Who falls for you so deeply that on your

50:44.160 --> 50:46.640
birthday he posts photos

50:46.680 --> 50:48.600
of all the things in the world he would have got you

50:48.640 --> 50:50.040
had he had his dad's wealth and power.

50:50.560 --> 50:53.240
Or is it just a coincidence those posts

50:50.560 --> 50:53.240
appear on the very day

50:53.280 --> 50:54.480
you turn 24?

50:54.720 --> 50:58.680
Maybe the affair did, as you say, fizzle out.

50:58.720 --> 51:02.440
But even so, I mean, Robert wouldn't tolerate

51:02.480 --> 51:06.040
his son muscling in on his property,

51:02.480 --> 51:06.040
would he?

51:07.200 --> 51:09.920
You see, that scratch has nothing to do with eczema.

51:10.040 --> 51:11.360
Your dad did that, didn't he?

51:12.120 --> 51:15.360
When he tore the necklace off you

51:12.120 --> 51:15.360
in the fight you had.

51:15.520 --> 51:16.800
Give me this. Give me this!

51:19.520 --> 51:22.320
Look what we found in the ashes

51:19.520 --> 51:22.320
of Gary's barbecue.

51:22.360 --> 51:23.560
Don't know what you're talking about.

51:24.360 --> 51:26.400
HUMPHREY: Well, if you'll allow me, Kim.

51:28.600 --> 51:31.040
You see? Perfect fit.

51:31.720 --> 51:35.480
We called and asked the nurses at your mum's nursing home.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.720
Your mum knew nothing about a pendant.

51:38.760 --> 51:41.680
HUMPHREY: Your dad must have outlined it

51:38.760 --> 51:41.680
in no uncertain terms.

51:44.400 --> 51:47.200
You break up or she is ruined.

51:48.240 --> 51:51.960
That was his style. He couldn't bear

51:48.240 --> 51:51.960
being number two to anyone.

51:54.160 --> 51:56.600
So he knocks you down, humiliates you.

51:54.160 --> 51:56.600
You've had enough!

51:57.800 --> 52:00.080
For years, you've watched him abuse

51:57.800 --> 52:00.080
everyone around him,

52:00.160 --> 52:03.040
mentally, financially, physically.

52:00.160 --> 52:03.040
When will it stop?

52:03.640 --> 52:05.880
<i>Humiliated and reeling,</i> <i>you follow him</i>

52:03.640 --> 52:05.880
<i>back into the restaurant.</i>

52:06.080 --> 52:09.480
<i>You're blind with anger.</i> <i>You grab a knife.</i>

52:10.000 --> 52:12.280
<i>Find him in the freezer</i> <i>and you stab him in the back.</i>

52:14.800 --> 52:17.520
He turns round and you stab him again,

52:17.600 --> 52:19.080
straight through the heart.

52:22.880 --> 52:25.240
Don't say anything, Matt.

52:26.680 --> 52:27.920
You realise what you've done.

52:29.480 --> 52:32.760
<i>You're horrified. You call</i> <i>your uncle and he arrives</i>

52:29.480 --> 52:32.760
<i>with all the team.</i>

52:33.200 --> 52:34.480
MATT: Help, help!

52:35.520 --> 52:39.920
HUMPHREY: <i> You're probably all</i> <i>shocked but, really,</i>

52:35.520 --> 52:39.920
<i>is anyone grieving?</i>

52:39.960 --> 52:42.200
Or did you all think he had it coming?

52:43.200 --> 52:46.840
And what is the point of wasting

52:43.200 --> 52:46.840
a young life, Matt's?

52:47.920 --> 52:49.960
Who's never hurt a fly in his life?

52:51.200 --> 52:53.080
Conspiracy to cover up the murder begins.

52:54.120 --> 52:55.400
This is what we do.

52:57.200 --> 52:59.800
Robert is left in the freezer in his T-shirt and shorts.

52:59.840 --> 53:01.600
Gary then goes back to the shack.

53:01.680 --> 53:04.040
With your clothes, the broken pendant

53:01.680 --> 53:04.040
still in your pocket

53:04.160 --> 53:05.600
and everything is burned.

53:07.720 --> 53:09.840
You carry on with the soft opening

53:07.720 --> 53:09.840
as if nothing had happened.

53:09.880 --> 53:12.280
You then wait the night out and return to make sure

53:12.320 --> 53:16.960
the delivery man sees you enter

53:12.320 --> 53:16.960
and find Robert's body.

53:17.000 --> 53:20.400
A clever, tight plan.

53:22.320 --> 53:24.280
If it hadn't been for this.

53:26.080 --> 53:28.240
Surviving the flames.

53:31.800 --> 53:33.160
You didn't know him. He would have

53:33.800 --> 53:35.160
destroyed us both.

53:35.520 --> 53:37.520
He treated everyone as if they were

53:35.520 --> 53:37.520
his own possession.

53:37.560 --> 53:40.240
-He didn't care for anyone. -So no one cared for him.

53:40.440 --> 53:44.640
Well, you all did at some time.

53:40.440 --> 53:44.640
Then he let you all down,

53:45.000 --> 53:46.520
one by one.

53:47.000 --> 53:50.120
So, what will happen to us?

53:50.320 --> 53:52.080
Conspiracy to pervert the course of justice

53:52.120 --> 53:54.640
but with a good lawyer, sensible judge...

53:57.120 --> 54:02.000
As they say, everyone loves to see justice

53:57.120 --> 54:02.000
done on somebody else.

54:03.880 --> 54:05.880
Make of that what you will.

54:06.320 --> 54:09.880
You know what? If this all happened again,

54:11.120 --> 54:14.400
I don't think anyone here would have acted

54:11.120 --> 54:14.400
any differently.

54:47.560 --> 54:49.480
Wait, wait, wait. Okay, okay, okay.

54:50.320 --> 54:51.920
You're a real bad man, you know.

54:52.240 --> 54:54.640
You're not too bad, either, for an old man.

54:54.680 --> 54:57.400
Sixty?

54:57.600 --> 54:59.120
Twenty-five plus.

54:59.520 --> 55:02.040
Yeah, 25 plus 35.

55:02.360 --> 55:06.200
Listen, if I make a deal with you,

55:02.360 --> 55:06.200
are you going to keep to it?

55:06.360 --> 55:08.440
-Depends. -Don't be cheeky.

55:09.440 --> 55:12.320
Now, I have a very good friend called Lenny.

55:12.360 --> 55:14.560
He runs a youth basketball team.

55:14.600 --> 55:16.600
They practise once a week on Tuesdays.

55:17.200 --> 55:20.280
Now, if you promise to go to school every day,

55:20.800 --> 55:24.520
I might, and I mean just might,

55:20.800 --> 55:24.520
have a word with him.

55:25.080 --> 55:28.080
I could pick you up afterwards,

55:25.080 --> 55:28.080
get you a hamburger, soda.

55:30.080 --> 55:32.000
Why are you doing this all for me?

55:35.640 --> 55:37.320
Let's just say that someone did

55:35.640 --> 55:37.320
the same thing for me

55:37.360 --> 55:39.480
when I was your age.

55:39.520 --> 55:41.040
And if they hadn't have done it,

55:41.760 --> 55:45.520
I wouldn't be around today doing the job I love.

55:46.040 --> 55:48.640
So, what are you saying

55:59.760 --> 56:02.240
I can't help but feel sorry for him.

56:02.280 --> 56:03.640
He's not even 21.

56:03.680 --> 56:07.040
Well, there is lots of mitigating circumstances.

56:08.200 --> 56:09.960
It wasn't premeditated.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.760
And when the court take into account

56:10.000 --> 56:12.760
what we know about his father,

56:12.800 --> 56:14.800
well, it's the age-old question.

56:15.160 --> 56:16.840
"Why do some people have children?"

56:17.000 --> 56:19.560
Oh, God. I hate this job.

56:20.120 --> 56:22.640
What on earth happened to you?

56:26.240 --> 56:28.840
For real. Had a little predicament.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.080
Had to get back into basketball.

56:31.720 --> 56:33.720
They used to call me Shark Attack.

56:33.760 --> 56:36.040
I was the Shaquille O'Neal of Saint-Marie, you know.

56:36.400 --> 56:37.920
Who used to call you that?

56:38.240 --> 56:40.400
-Very funny.

56:42.320 --> 56:45.320
-I see there's trouble in paradise.

56:42.320 --> 56:45.320
-I don't think so.

56:45.640 --> 56:47.680
But the Inspector does.

56:48.000 --> 56:51.000
Yep. It's got all the hallmarks

56:48.000 --> 56:51.000
of a breakup chat.

56:51.240 --> 56:54.040
I missed you so much last night.

56:51.240 --> 56:54.040
I really did.

56:54.760 --> 56:56.280
Yes, me, too.

56:56.320 --> 56:59.480
But, you know, what could I do?

56:56.320 --> 56:59.480
I couldn't just leave.

56:59.880 --> 57:02.920
The Inspector was really getting into it.

57:03.160 --> 57:05.920
You know, putting on one

57:03.160 --> 57:05.920
DVD after another.

57:09.200 --> 57:11.680
She's laughing. But that's a good sign.

57:11.800 --> 57:14.440
Not always, in my experience. -Oh, God.

57:19.120 --> 57:21.760
-Oh, my God!

57:21.800 --> 57:23.240
Whoa!

57:30.520 --> 57:32.240
Congratulations.

57:32.440 --> 57:33.480
Okay, I'll be best man.

57:33.840 --> 57:36.480
Yeah, and I will do the catering and...

57:38.760 --> 57:41.280
What do you know? Our first wedding.

57:42.440 --> 57:44.440
So, who's next in line?

57:44.680 --> 57:46.880
Don't look at me, you know.

57:47.920 --> 57:51.360
It's like you said, sir. Love can be found anywhere.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.120
HUMPHREY: It's very true.

57:54.160 --> 57:55.320
But until then,

57:56.800 --> 57:59.360
guess you two will have to do.

58:11.200 --> 58:12.920
-To us! -To us.

58:12.960 --> 58:14.400
From the Santa Ana silt.

58:14.520 --> 58:16.280
There was nothing fair about what you did!

58:16.320 --> 58:17.360
Get away from my boat!

58:17.600 --> 58:19.360
A body's been found at Blue Bay Cove.

58:19.400 --> 58:20.640
Do you mean like actual treasure?

58:20.680 --> 58:22.600
That's not the terminology we'd use.

58:22.640 --> 58:24.080
That's brilliant!

58:24.120 --> 58:25.960
There's barely a scratch on it.

58:24.120 --> 58:25.960
It's virtually... Well,

58:26.520 --> 58:28.360
it's JP's stag do tonight.

58:28.400 --> 58:32.240
I'll be round to pick you up at 6:00 p.m. sharp.

58:32.280 --> 58:34.440
I don't think I want to go to my stag do.
