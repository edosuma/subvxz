00:04.304 --> 00:09.744
This programme contains some strong
language and some violent scenes.

00:09.744 --> 00:12.412
A dead medic is no good to anyone.
I could do with another grown-up

00:12.412 --> 00:15.504
on tour with me.Elvis isn't the
reason why I'm not coming back.

00:15.504 --> 00:16.912
Why aren't you coming to Afghan?

00:16.912 --> 00:18.064
I'm a soldier.

00:18.064 --> 00:20.752
I need to be able to handle
whatever the army throws at me.

00:20.752 --> 00:22.288
I knew you wouldn't leave me

00:22.288 --> 00:24.464
to handle that freaks' roll call
on my own.

00:24.464 --> 00:27.664
The situation is improving, though -
I mean, now that the war's ended?

00:27.664 --> 00:29.840
The war hasn't ended for us.
Just for you.

00:29.840 --> 00:32.336
LOUD BLAST
Been here a day
and already a damned expert.

00:32.336 --> 00:34.640
The child would have bled out
if it wasn't for her!

00:34.640 --> 00:37.732
Keep looking me.
Don't look down there.

00:37.732 --> 00:40.016
It seems like the Taliban
are targeting the hospital...

00:40.016 --> 00:41.104
And Dr Bahil.

00:41.104 --> 00:43.920
That's me. Hospital administrator
and doctor, when needs must.

00:43.920 --> 00:45.136
Aatan Omar.

00:45.136 --> 00:48.532
He was behind the special forces
fatality in Kabul, sir.

00:48.532 --> 01:13.552
Elvis Harte.
PHONE RINGS, BOMB BLASTS

01:13.552 --> 01:17.092
BOMB BLASTS

01:17.092 --> 01:24.496
LABOURED BREATHING

01:24.496 --> 01:27.412
That sounded like a bad one.

01:27.412 --> 01:56.452
Go back to sleep, Mimi.

01:56.452 --> 01:58.612
Wet the bed?

01:58.612 --> 02:01.936
Thought it was another earthquake.
Like being back in Nepal for a sec.

02:01.936 --> 02:06.172
No, just one huge bomb blast.

02:06.172 --> 02:08.212
What you doing up?

02:08.212 --> 02:09.652
Just wanted to jump on the Wi-Fi

02:09.652 --> 02:11.856
and call Marie before everyone else
gets on it.

02:11.856 --> 02:13.972
And what's the state of the nation
with Marie?

02:13.972 --> 02:16.016
Well, she's found something
on Secret Escapes.

02:16.016 --> 02:18.448
New York, Niagara Falls, Toronto

02:18.448 --> 02:22.544
then The Queen Mary,
back to Southampton.Nice.Yeah.

02:22.544 --> 02:24.336
Except I only get ten days' R&R

02:24.336 --> 02:26.576
so we're going Lanzarote.

02:26.576 --> 02:28.304
No.

02:28.304 --> 02:30.096
What? And Marie's happy that you're

02:30.096 --> 02:32.016
going Lanza-grotty
for your honeymoon?

02:32.016 --> 02:35.024
Well, I told her
it's where Ariana Grande went.

02:35.024 --> 02:37.456
It's the things you've gotta say
when you're in love, innit?

02:37.456 --> 02:42.320
You are so in love, aren't you?

02:42.320 --> 02:44.212
You soppy bollocks.

02:44.212 --> 02:46.864
Yeah, it's true, actually.

02:46.864 --> 02:49.424
Mad.

02:49.424 --> 02:56.016
She is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

02:56.016 --> 02:58.768
Right, I'm going to get some kip
before it's another day.

02:58.768 --> 03:00.532
Go to bed, you.Yeah, I will.

03:00.532 --> 03:03.892
Sleep well.Night.

03:03.892 --> 03:47.728
MUSIC: Running by Christian Loffler

03:47.728 --> 03:53.452
VOICEMAIL:End of saved message.

03:53.452 --> 03:57.652
Message saved.

03:57.652 --> 03:58.928
There you are!

03:58.928 --> 04:03.292
Come on! Photo roll call.

04:03.292 --> 04:06.928
You've done all the sorting.
Thought I was doing that today.

04:06.928 --> 04:17.104
Come on, Serge.

04:17.104 --> 04:19.664
# Can you hear the people marching

04:19.664 --> 04:21.584
# Louder than the drums?

04:21.584 --> 04:24.532
# Can you hear the people coming

04:24.532 --> 04:26.512
# Louder than the drums?

04:26.512 --> 04:29.332
# Can you hear the people marching

04:29.332 --> 04:31.376
# Louder than the drums?

04:31.376 --> 04:36.560
# Can you hear the people coming?

04:36.560 --> 04:39.184
# Can you hear the people marching

04:39.184 --> 04:40.852
# Louder than the drums?

04:40.852 --> 04:42.172
# This is our battle cry

04:42.172 --> 04:43.984
# Can you hear the people marching?

04:43.984 --> 04:47.452
# This is our battlecry. #

04:47.452 --> 04:49.936
This is going to be epic.
Be careful.

04:49.936 --> 04:51.344
Our group WhatsApp photo!

04:51.344 --> 04:55.376
Keep it still! Hold it, hold it.

04:55.376 --> 04:58.192
My back!Oi.

04:58.192 --> 05:01.972
Fall in!

05:01.972 --> 05:04.528
The Brigadier is
waiting to brief us.

05:04.528 --> 05:07.024
Sort yourselves out,
get your heads in the right space.

05:07.024 --> 05:09.776
If any of you numb-nuts manage to
get injured titting around,

05:09.776 --> 05:12.532
I will personally
spoon out your eyes.

05:12.532 --> 05:15.412
DISTANT TRUMPET CALL

05:15.412 --> 05:17.776
Right, recognise that sound.

05:17.776 --> 05:24.532
All seated in the operations
briefing room, now!

05:24.532 --> 05:28.528
I think I've got one good one.

05:28.528 --> 05:31.252
It's you on your face.
What's that, Rabee?

05:31.252 --> 05:33.968
Endurance run!
The British always lose.

05:33.968 --> 05:36.208
Endurance run? How far's that then?

05:36.208 --> 05:38.256
3.4 miles per lap.

05:38.256 --> 05:40.432
On the hour, starts again
and keep going,

05:40.432 --> 05:43.612
on and on till last man
is standing.Or woman, thank you.

05:43.612 --> 05:45.172
Poya will win.

05:45.172 --> 05:46.384
Lads, what do you reckon?

05:46.384 --> 05:48.624
Who votes someone taking this on?

05:48.624 --> 05:51.412
I mean there's a few of us
proper fit lads.

05:51.412 --> 05:53.692
What, like you?

05:53.692 --> 05:58.928
Oh, my days. Hurry up!

05:58.928 --> 06:00.912
Sit them easy, Colour Sergeant.

06:00.912 --> 06:04.496
At ease.

06:04.496 --> 06:08.976
Double AP suicide bomb blast
outside the Kabul Hospital.

06:08.976 --> 06:10.972
Another bombing overnight,

06:10.972 --> 06:12.816
this time at a wedding.

06:12.816 --> 06:16.252
Initial thoughts were random attack
organised by local warlord

06:16.252 --> 06:17.812
Aatan Omar.

06:17.812 --> 06:19.856
We think this is him.

06:19.856 --> 06:22.288
However, joint covert operatives

06:22.288 --> 06:24.336
have confirmed there was

06:24.336 --> 06:27.024
a specific target. Dr Bahil.

06:27.024 --> 06:28.972
Hospital administrator.

06:28.972 --> 06:31.696
Aatan Omar has been
targeting places of work

06:31.696 --> 06:35.024
and launching attacks on weddings
and funerals

06:35.024 --> 06:36.944
of anyone who opposes him.

06:36.944 --> 06:40.656
Thus far, his personal death toll
stands at several thousand,

06:40.656 --> 06:45.904
including a number of allied forces.

06:45.904 --> 06:49.296
Of course, he's not carrying out
these atrocities himself,

06:49.296 --> 06:52.732
rather he directs operations
from somewhere in the mountains,

06:52.732 --> 06:55.376
making him
particularly difficult to locate.

06:55.376 --> 06:58.192
And this is Dr Bahil,

06:58.192 --> 07:00.652
the targeted hospital administrator.

07:00.652 --> 07:06.412
Her husband, Dr Dak Bahil, was
running for re-election last year.

07:06.412 --> 07:07.984
Assassinated.

07:07.984 --> 07:11.248
She's standing for his vacant seat.

07:11.248 --> 07:17.212
Our task is to keep Dr Bahil alive
and well.

07:17.212 --> 07:22.704
Carry on, Lieutenant Hurst.

07:22.704 --> 07:24.892
All right, everyone.

07:24.892 --> 07:26.224
You heard the Brigadier.

07:26.224 --> 07:29.360
We're protecting Dr Bahil
whilst she's at the hospital.

07:29.360 --> 07:31.536
With that in mind,
Sergeant Lane and Saunders,

07:31.536 --> 07:34.544
you'll be working with the local
medics at the Kabul Hospital today.

07:34.544 --> 07:37.296
Pick up any supplies you need
from the American Role One facility.

07:37.296 --> 07:39.728
Sir.Take Rabee and Poya with you.

07:39.728 --> 07:43.972
Prof, Fingers, Throbber,
you're joining Oscar Team.

07:43.972 --> 07:47.728
Assisting local forces with security
and escorting the medics in Kabul.

07:47.728 --> 07:49.012
Spud, Monk...

07:49.012 --> 07:51.292
You're heading to the airport.
Guardian Angel duty.

07:51.292 --> 07:53.936
American civil engineer
meeting with a local council member.

07:53.936 --> 07:55.372
HE TOOTS

07:55.372 --> 08:00.656
All right everyone, dismissed.
Get some scoff, prepare to move.

08:00.656 --> 08:03.052
Should have joined the scouts, Monk.
              What?

08:03.052 --> 08:04.496
Bruv, Guardian Angel duty's

08:04.496 --> 08:07.376
basically driving some muppet around
     all day, like an Uber.

08:07.376 --> 08:13.520
Have you got a Prius?Shut up.

08:13.520 --> 08:15.696
ELVIS' VOICE ECHOES:Where's Omar?

08:15.696 --> 08:17.424
He says Omar's not here.

08:17.424 --> 08:19.132
We have approximately
nine fatalities.

08:19.132 --> 08:20.880
Emergency evacuation required.

08:20.880 --> 08:22.544
Has anyone got eyes on Omar?

08:22.544 --> 08:26.128
I wasn't privy to the intelligence
briefing back in the UK.

08:26.128 --> 08:31.012
If I'd have known we were
still dealing with Omar...

08:31.012 --> 08:33.532
If you need me to put out
a trawl for another medic...

08:33.532 --> 08:37.776
It's not going to be us out there
hunting the UK's most wanted, is it?

08:37.776 --> 08:41.692
Omar's way above our pay grade.

08:41.692 --> 08:44.692
Our job is to protect Dr Bahil.

08:44.692 --> 08:48.784
So let's get on with it.

08:48.784 --> 08:51.216
We need blast bandages,

08:51.216 --> 08:54.480
ChitoGauze,
haemorrhage control packs,

08:54.480 --> 08:57.936
trauma dressing, S-rolled gauze,
which is at the bottom there.

08:57.936 --> 08:59.984
If it's not Kate and Meghan!

08:59.984 --> 09:02.608
Splintage and immobilisation kit
available down the hall.

09:02.608 --> 09:04.656
Let's also pick up
pelvic and traction splints

09:04.656 --> 09:10.288
and a couple of head immobilisers
too. Come on, Princesses!

09:10.288 --> 09:12.976
I thought you were a doctor, sir.

09:12.976 --> 09:14.384
I am a doctor.

09:14.384 --> 09:17.456
Did you think I was
just pretending? I meant...

09:17.456 --> 09:19.184
I didn't know you were military.

09:19.184 --> 09:22.012
Tend to not wear my uniform
when in downtown Kabul.

09:22.012 --> 09:24.772
Don't know whether you've heard
but there's a war on.

09:24.772 --> 09:26.572
SHE CHUCKLES

09:26.572 --> 09:29.692
We've been tasked with assisting
Dr Bahil with the inoculations

09:29.692 --> 09:31.664
whilst working as close protection.

09:31.664 --> 09:34.928
Multi-tasking. Saving lives
and preventing an epidemic.

09:34.928 --> 09:37.852
We're honoured.Will you be helping
us at the local hospital, sir?

09:37.852 --> 09:39.984
I'm operating there today.

09:39.984 --> 09:41.520
They blow each other up.

09:41.520 --> 09:43.632
I stitch them back together.

09:43.632 --> 09:45.052
Then it happens all over again.

09:45.052 --> 09:47.092
Politics.

09:47.092 --> 09:48.532
Don't be shy, ladies.

09:48.532 --> 09:56.368
You're welcome to anything you need.

09:56.368 --> 09:59.888
Life-saving surgeon, hero
in a uniform, nice, chiselled jaw.

09:59.888 --> 10:21.584
Can we just crack on, please,
Saunders?OK.

10:21.584 --> 10:23.952
Arriving at the hospital now, sir.

10:23.952 --> 10:26.452
Can confirm check point in place.

10:26.452 --> 10:28.372
Afghan police for you.

10:28.372 --> 10:30.544
Don't trust none of them,
to be honest.

10:30.544 --> 10:32.400
They're just the same as us,
really, bro.

10:32.400 --> 10:35.856
Might be the same as you, fella,
but I ain't about to blow myself up.

10:35.856 --> 10:38.480
Because you haven't had
the life they've had.

10:38.480 --> 10:51.600
We don't do that sort of shit
in Wolves.

10:51.600 --> 10:54.928
We've admitted 107 patients
in the last 24 hours.

10:54.928 --> 10:56.572
Most with major bomb blast trauma.

10:56.572 --> 10:58.704
The only trouble is,
we only had six beds.

10:58.704 --> 11:00.412
Can we do anything to help
the patients?

11:00.412 --> 11:02.572
You're here to supervise
the polio inoculations.

11:02.572 --> 11:05.424
These people will be treated or
beds found elsewhere, eventually.

11:05.424 --> 11:08.944
Thank you very much. On you go.

11:08.944 --> 11:11.248
Don't tell me
we're doing this all day.

11:11.248 --> 11:14.256
Look, I'm sorry to have to do this
but it's for everyone's safety, OK?

11:14.256 --> 11:16.048
Just come forward, arms out.

11:16.048 --> 11:19.504
PROF SPEAKS IN PASHTO

11:19.504 --> 11:22.492
I ain't really got time for all that
   mumbo jumbo bollocks, Prof.

11:22.492 --> 11:29.936
No wonder your wife left you.

11:29.936 --> 11:31.132
Polio.

11:31.132 --> 11:33.652
Eradicated in all but
three countries globally.

11:33.652 --> 11:36.052
One of those countries
being Afghanistan.

11:36.052 --> 11:38.576
The situation is reaching
tipping point.

11:38.576 --> 11:41.456
At the moment the disease is winning
    and we're on a precipice.

11:41.456 --> 11:43.972
Hence the urgent need
to vaccinate all the children.

11:43.972 --> 11:46.896
We mustn't allow the disease
to spread into the city

11:46.896 --> 11:49.072
or it will be impossible to contain.

11:49.072 --> 11:51.952
Looks like we're not going to need
anyone supervising today.

11:51.952 --> 11:53.424
Where is everyone?

11:53.424 --> 11:55.856
Would you bring your child to
a place that is being bombed?

11:55.856 --> 11:57.904
What about the medical
outreach projects?

11:57.904 --> 12:00.912
We're trying to run them. I'd
trained up a team of local medics.

12:00.912 --> 12:02.768
But several were attacked
and killed.

12:02.768 --> 12:06.052
It's becoming
impossible to staff with such risks.

12:06.052 --> 12:07.612
So what do we do?

12:07.612 --> 12:26.452
If the children won't come here,
I need to go to them.

12:26.452 --> 12:29.584
This isn't exactly what
we signed up for, is it? Security.

12:29.584 --> 12:32.336
My Doris' uncle is security -
McDonald's Westfield.

12:32.336 --> 12:35.280
Yeah, I'm heading over there now.
I think so? Are you my security?

12:35.280 --> 12:38.096
Ma'am.Yeah, two.

12:38.096 --> 12:39.892
They'll do, I guess.

12:39.892 --> 12:45.776
Come on.

12:45.776 --> 12:51.984
Door!Oh, my days.

12:51.984 --> 12:58.448
Thank you.

12:58.448 --> 13:01.852
Man's not an Uber driver.

13:01.852 --> 13:03.312
Thank you very much.

13:03.312 --> 13:05.616
Thank you.We should be out there...

13:05.616 --> 13:07.732
Fingers?

13:07.732 --> 13:11.452
I want contact.
I'm itching for my first kill!

13:11.452 --> 13:12.720
Do you know what, mate?

13:12.720 --> 13:14.332
On my first tour I felt the same.

13:14.332 --> 13:15.920
But now...

13:15.920 --> 13:18.772
Very happy being right at the back.

13:18.772 --> 13:20.848
Nah. We all join the army
for contact.

13:20.848 --> 13:23.408
My old corporal
told me on Phase 1 training

13:23.408 --> 13:27.120
"soldiering is 99% boredom,
1% extreme violence."

13:27.120 --> 13:29.488
Bring on the 1% then.

13:29.488 --> 13:32.112
Modern soldiering
is about much more.

13:32.112 --> 13:35.572
Nowadays, we make a difference
without having to kill people.

13:35.572 --> 13:37.616
Yeah, I want to make a difference...

13:37.616 --> 13:40.048
by dishing out
some extreme violence,

13:40.048 --> 13:43.056

Let them know who's in charge, Prof.

13:47.024 --> 13:49.648
You don't need to be workshopping
every fucker coming through.

13:49.648 --> 13:52.016
English, yeah.

13:52.016 --> 13:53.744
Thank you.

13:53.744 --> 13:58.372
Step forward, come on. Come on.

13:58.372 --> 14:00.532
Come forward. Arms out.

14:00.532 --> 14:02.812
If it wasn't for
your quick thinking yesterday,

14:02.812 --> 14:05.264
she'd have died in the street.
Is she going to be OK?

14:05.264 --> 14:07.056
We're going to need to operate.

14:07.056 --> 14:08.976
But you couldn't save
her leg, yeah?

14:08.976 --> 14:10.384
Crushed tibia and fibula.

14:10.384 --> 14:12.688
Shrapnel damage to the tendons
and muscles

14:12.688 --> 14:14.608
linking the upper and lower leg.

14:14.608 --> 14:17.936
Sensible option
would be to remove the leg.

14:17.936 --> 14:20.332
What?

14:20.332 --> 14:21.652
If the Queen was lying here,

14:21.652 --> 14:24.412
we'd find a way to repair her,
wouldn't we, sir?

14:24.412 --> 14:28.012
If it was the Queen I'd imagine she
might have a ready supply of drugs

14:28.012 --> 14:29.332
to keep the leg alive,

14:29.332 --> 14:33.052
and a medical team that would allow
time for the muscles and tissues

14:33.052 --> 14:35.932
to rebuild with months of
painful physiotherapy,

14:35.932 --> 14:47.696
rather than the risk of infection
setting in and killing her.

14:47.696 --> 14:49.744

14:49.744 --> 14:54.096
What ARE you doing
with a snow globe in your bergan?

14:54.096 --> 14:55.568
Sorry, Sergeant.

14:55.568 --> 14:58.704
I got it in America when my parents
took me to Florida.

14:58.704 --> 15:00.368
My surprise Sweet Sixteen.

15:00.368 --> 15:05.424
So now it's just, like,
my lucky charm.

15:05.424 --> 15:09.264
Look, I'll see what I can do
but, at best,

15:09.264 --> 15:14.128
this little girl has
an uncertain future.

15:14.128 --> 15:18.352
See? Lucky charm.

15:18.352 --> 15:30.532
Nurse, let's prep her
for surgery right away.

15:30.532 --> 15:33.008
I need your help with Dr Bahil.

15:33.008 --> 15:36.464
We need to explain to her that
until Omar's been terminated

15:36.464 --> 15:37.872
it's too dangerous for her to

15:37.872 --> 15:40.304
contemplate manning
an outreach project.

15:40.304 --> 15:43.252
We can explain.
It doesn't mean she'll listen.

15:43.252 --> 15:45.296
Well, just tell her
she can't leave the hospital.

15:45.296 --> 15:47.452
Say that all the vaccinations
need to be done here.

15:47.452 --> 15:49.584
Insist.You've met her.

15:49.584 --> 15:51.568
She'll be signing
her own death warrant

15:51.568 --> 15:53.488
if she takes a team
into the mountains.

15:53.488 --> 15:55.732
She's determined.
I've known her for years.

15:55.732 --> 15:57.264
We used to work together
in New York.

15:57.264 --> 15:59.572
So how do we guarantee her safety?

15:59.572 --> 16:01.252
This is Afghanistan.

16:01.252 --> 16:11.092
There are no guarantees.

If you take an outreach team
in to the mountains,

16:35.152 --> 16:37.392
we could provide
a proper protection force.

16:37.392 --> 16:39.652
We could assist ANA, ANP, ISAF.

16:39.652 --> 16:41.424
We're talking about
remote communities.

16:41.424 --> 16:42.704
The people are suspicious.

16:42.704 --> 16:45.292
They don't trust outsiders,
especially allied soldiers.

16:45.292 --> 16:46.672

16:46.672 --> 16:48.784

He's carrying a girls' bag.

16:53.520 --> 16:55.760
Why are you carrying
a girls' bag, mate? Eh?

16:55.760 --> 16:58.732
Is it to go with your dress?

16:58.732 --> 17:01.776
Steady, sunshine!
We all got a job to do.

17:01.776 --> 17:04.016

I hear what you're saying
and I understand your reservations.

17:28.144 --> 17:29.616
But we need to get a move on.

17:29.616 --> 17:32.816
We need to clear this area up.
Washington has given us the go ahead

17:32.816 --> 17:35.632

get clearance to move the resources.

talk about the irrigation

18:00.292 --> 18:06.928

and we will reconvene again.

for? Pick up some more, bro.

18:27.536 --> 18:31.972
Her temperature's stabilising.
That's good news, isn't it, sir?

18:31.972 --> 18:35.092
Yeah. Let's see how she progresses
over the next 72 hours.

18:35.092 --> 18:43.536
Saunders, on me, let's move.

18:43.536 --> 18:47.504
And good day to you, too.

18:47.504 --> 18:50.212
She must have some family somewhere.

18:50.212 --> 18:52.496
Well, we know her mum's
dead already.

18:52.496 --> 18:55.376
I know. But if we can somehow locate
    the rest of her family...

18:55.376 --> 18:58.320
Look, if she had any more family
they would have found her already.

18:58.320 --> 18:59.984
Maybe they don't know
she's been injured

18:59.984 --> 19:02.224
or they've got no way of
getting to the hospital.

19:02.224 --> 19:05.296
There's thousands -
hundreds of thousands - of orphans.

19:05.296 --> 19:07.920
I wish we could take care of
every one of them, you know?

19:07.920 --> 19:09.776
Yeah, I know.

19:09.776 --> 19:12.336
But we can't
because it's not in our remit.

19:12.336 --> 19:14.812
We have other duties.

19:14.812 --> 19:16.372
I've got to say,

19:16.372 --> 19:19.184
that's the first time
I've ever been into

19:19.184 --> 19:22.320
any hospital ever
and not seen one fit nurse.

19:22.320 --> 19:26.416
Shut up, Throbber.

19:26.416 --> 19:28.976
I think you lot need to start
being nice to me and Spud here.

19:28.976 --> 19:30.292
What's that all about then?

19:30.292 --> 19:32.304
Not good for your complexion
that, Throbber.

19:32.304 --> 19:33.328
Who give you all that?

19:33.328 --> 19:36.144
It's what happens when you're on
Guardian Angel duty for the Yanks.

19:36.144 --> 19:37.852
No wonder they're all fucking obese.

19:37.852 --> 19:39.600
Not all, mate. Check that lot out.

19:39.600 --> 19:40.816
Right, we need to sort out

19:40.816 --> 19:43.504
who's representing the platoon
in this endurance race.

19:43.504 --> 19:45.488
The Yanks are taking it serious.

19:45.488 --> 19:48.816
They take everything serious.
Especially themselves.

19:48.816 --> 19:51.376
Right. Who's repping the platoon,
Colour?

19:51.376 --> 19:53.452
I'm not saying it's gotta be me, BUT

19:53.452 --> 19:55.856
it ought to be the best person
for the job...

19:55.856 --> 19:57.328
..which is obviously me, yeah?

19:57.328 --> 19:59.092
I mean...

19:59.092 --> 20:02.064
..we're winners, aren't we?
Me and you, Colour?

20:02.064 --> 20:05.136
How the fuck did we survive
before you joined the platoon?

20:05.136 --> 20:11.728
Exactly.

20:11.728 --> 20:13.732
Wow.

20:13.732 --> 20:15.772
Do you think that
we should add anything else?

20:15.772 --> 20:17.168
Like phone numbers or...?

20:17.168 --> 20:19.152
It says, "This child
is at Kabul Hospital."

20:19.152 --> 20:21.532
I know, well, if we put them up...
If someone is missing her,

20:21.532 --> 20:24.784
they will find her.Well,
someone is missing her, surely.

20:24.784 --> 20:29.212
Just imagine if we can unite this
little lost girl with her family.

20:29.212 --> 20:34.448
I mean, how great would that be?

20:34.448 --> 20:36.496
We're deployed here
for training and mentoring,

20:36.496 --> 20:40.144
sometimes security, yes,
but all within a safe zone of Kabul.

20:40.144 --> 20:42.576
Yeah, but don't we have a duty
to protect Dr Bahil?

20:42.576 --> 20:44.624
Yes, within the confines
of the local hospital.

20:44.624 --> 20:46.972
She'll be leaving the confines
of the hospital tomorrow,

20:46.972 --> 20:48.052
irrespective of what I say.

20:48.052 --> 20:50.704
Then we inform local forces
and she becomes their charge.

20:50.704 --> 20:53.520
No, no, no. What she becomes
is a viable target for Omar.

20:53.520 --> 20:55.760
We need to be the ones out
protecting her,

20:55.760 --> 20:58.064
not leaving it to the Afghan Police.

20:58.064 --> 21:00.816
Especially after what happened
at the hospital.

21:00.816 --> 21:02.288
It was one bad apple.

21:02.288 --> 21:04.272
Yeah, and all we need
is one bad apple

21:04.272 --> 21:06.292
and we'll be signing
Dr Bahil's death warrant.

21:06.292 --> 21:09.072
Well, we can't give her orders,
unlike you, Sergeant Lane.

21:09.072 --> 21:11.572
Surely it's not beyond the wit
of the British Army to organise

21:11.572 --> 21:14.000
a security team to travel with her.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.932
Look, I have orders. I follow them.

21:17.932 --> 21:28.912
I suggest you do, too, Lane.

Oh, my God, do you hear him?
Oh, my God.

22:11.728 --> 22:14.692
Look, we're running out of time.
You must talk to Dr Bahil.

22:14.692 --> 22:15.824
She'll listen to you.

22:15.824 --> 22:17.332
I wouldn't guarantee it.

22:17.332 --> 22:19.984
All right, will you sort some
transport to the hospital, then?

22:19.984 --> 22:22.736
So I talk to her.She's here.

22:22.736 --> 22:24.976
Collecting supplies.Really?

22:24.976 --> 22:29.968
Yeah, I invited her.

22:29.968 --> 22:32.212
So, Manchester...

22:32.212 --> 22:33.680
You got two soccer teams?

22:33.680 --> 22:35.932
Nope, just the one.

22:35.932 --> 22:38.932
Stockport County.

22:38.932 --> 22:47.696
It's a Greater Manchester thing,
you won't understand.

22:47.696 --> 22:49.296
DOOR SHUTS

22:49.296 --> 22:51.772
Told them.Who?

22:51.772 --> 22:53.264
The Brits.

22:53.264 --> 22:55.632
I've explained that
you are the most determined

22:55.632 --> 22:57.808
and passionate person I know.

22:57.808 --> 23:00.304
You decide on a mission,
you undertake it.

23:00.304 --> 23:02.096
Ah, so that's why I'm here.

23:02.096 --> 23:04.976
Hey, we know each other too well.

23:04.976 --> 23:06.576
Have I ever steered you wrong?

23:06.576 --> 23:09.456
Well, you did take me to some
insalubrious dives in New York.

23:09.456 --> 23:11.888
Country and Western bars
are supposed to be insalubrious.

23:11.888 --> 23:15.088
That's the point.
Remember Dak and the lasso?

23:15.088 --> 23:18.772
One of the great nights out.

23:18.772 --> 23:28.912
Dak loved it there, didn't he?

23:28.912 --> 23:30.772
Sorry.

23:30.772 --> 23:35.824
I like talking about him.

23:35.824 --> 23:38.256
I always went with you and Dak.

23:38.256 --> 23:41.136
And that's the point.

23:41.136 --> 23:43.312
We can't afford to let them
kill you.

23:43.312 --> 23:45.172
They kill you, they've won.

23:45.172 --> 23:48.432
We need to be protecting you.

23:48.432 --> 23:50.736
Brace up!

23:50.736 --> 23:55.132
As you were, guys.

23:55.132 --> 23:59.332
We've been asked by my American
and Afghani counterparts

23:59.332 --> 24:02.332
to assist with an outreach mission
today.

24:02.332 --> 24:05.904
So, Erstwhile plan now on hold.

24:05.904 --> 24:10.012

24:10.012 --> 24:12.412
Mine is not to reason why.

24:12.412 --> 24:16.852
Right, some of you will be venturing
outside the walls of Kabul today,

24:16.852 --> 24:19.732
working close security with
a mobile clinic.

24:19.732 --> 24:21.968
Alpha team, close protection.

24:21.968 --> 24:24.336
And Sergeant Lane, Saunders,

24:24.336 --> 24:26.960
you'll be working with Rabee
and Dr Bahil's medical team,

24:26.960 --> 24:29.692
assisting as they head
towards the Kowt-e Ashro region.

24:29.692 --> 24:32.016
Bravo, along with a platoon of ANA,

24:32.016 --> 24:35.092
will be that outer cordon of steel
around Alpha.

24:36.652 --> 24:41.692
We also need someone to represent
the platoon at the endurance race.

24:41.692 --> 24:44.304
We need someone who'll leave it
all out on the track,

24:44.304 --> 24:47.120
hold nothing back
and do the regiment proud.

24:47.120 --> 24:50.768
With that in mind, there was only
ever one man for the job.

24:50.768 --> 24:54.292
This is like fucking
political correctness gone mad.

24:54.292 --> 24:55.888
Why's that, mate?

24:55.888 --> 24:58.256
Prof doing the endurance run?

24:58.256 --> 25:00.624
It's like when the fat,
ugly kid gets picked

25:00.624 --> 25:02.992
to play Joseph in the nativity play.

25:02.992 --> 25:05.232
You're revealing a bit too much
there, Throbber.

25:05.232 --> 25:08.048
I'd have been a bare better
Joseph. Fact. Yeah?

25:08.048 --> 25:10.492
We're about to be made to
look like a right...

25:10.492 --> 25:12.784

is everyone happy with the plan?

25:27.568 --> 25:34.864
Shut up and get in.

25:34.864 --> 25:36.912
You OK?Yeah, fine.

25:36.912 --> 25:38.512
Good luck.

25:38.512 --> 25:41.008

26:20.368 --> 26:22.012
I know what that nod means.

26:22.012 --> 26:24.976
Sir?It means, "Thank you, Doctor.

26:24.976 --> 26:27.292
"Without you, none of this
would be happening."

26:27.292 --> 26:32.592
It's amazing what I can
do with a look, innit?

26:32.592 --> 26:36.816
Any news on Giti, sir?

26:36.816 --> 26:39.312
Yeah. Intravenous antibiotics
seem to be working.

26:39.312 --> 26:41.332
So now it's just a waiting game.

26:41.332 --> 26:44.332

everything's going to be all right.

297 children under five
within this area alone.

27:38.812 --> 27:43.184

We need to go door to door.

There's still a few hours left.

27:46.192 --> 27:49.372
And 250 children remain
unvaccinated.

27:49.372 --> 27:52.016
They're not going to come,
not with the military outside.

27:52.016 --> 27:54.448
They think you're here
to poison them.

27:54.448 --> 28:12.052

I've been proved right.

Well, no-one has rocked up
so I may as well keep myself busy.

28:25.936 --> 28:48.208
No, make yourself busy in here doing
something that you're paid to do.

28:48.208 --> 28:52.176
Lane, leave her to deal with it.

28:52.176 --> 28:53.776
Calm down.

28:53.776 --> 28:59.932

28:59.932 --> 29:01.456

30:11.344 --> 30:13.972
Yeah. And you
should have been Joseph.

30:13.972 --> 30:26.128
Do not bring that up again.
I'm trying to move on.

30:26.128 --> 30:28.432
You don't understand. How could you?

30:28.432 --> 30:29.968
You know why we're here.

30:29.968 --> 30:31.440
Here today, or in Afghanistan?

30:31.440 --> 30:33.052
Both.

30:33.052 --> 30:36.176
The children will be kept away,
polio will spread and more pain -

30:36.176 --> 30:38.572
because of you,
because of your presence.

30:38.572 --> 30:40.528
And what would happen
if we just pulled out?

30:40.528 --> 30:43.536
You did! In combat terms,
you're here training and mentoring.

30:43.536 --> 30:45.968
And why? Cos you'd saved
Afghanistan?

30:45.968 --> 30:48.292
No, because your people
didn't like your soldiers

30:48.292 --> 30:50.896
coming home in coffins.
It offended them.

30:50.896 --> 30:53.136
But they don't seem too offended
by Afghani deaths.

30:53.136 --> 30:54.416
That's so wrong.

30:54.416 --> 30:58.256
Really? The people of your country
suffer with my people?

30:58.256 --> 31:00.052
I don't think so.

31:00.052 --> 31:04.144
I don't think it even makes
your newspapers any more.

31:04.144 --> 31:06.960
I lost someone who I loved
in this conflict, too.

31:06.960 --> 31:09.052
And that makes us sisters, does it?

31:09.052 --> 31:12.292
No.I take it your husband
volunteered?

31:12.292 --> 31:14.256
My husband had no choice.

31:14.256 --> 31:18.352
The people of Afghanistan
have no choice.

31:18.352 --> 31:22.256
So many soldiers.

31:22.256 --> 31:25.972
We weren't actually married.

31:25.972 --> 31:29.616
He was killed on the day
he proposed to me.

31:29.616 --> 31:34.012
By Omar, the same warlord
who killed your husband

31:34.012 --> 31:39.344
and is now targeting you.

31:39.344 --> 31:42.352
So maybe we have more in common
than you ever could imagine.

31:42.352 --> 31:46.012
Don't. Don't try to connect
with me, please.

31:46.012 --> 31:48.412
The only way we're going to be able
to reach the children

31:48.412 --> 31:51.892
we need to reach is by having
no military presence.

31:51.892 --> 32:04.304

from now on.

32:21.328 --> 32:23.376
Just about, by the looks of things.

32:23.376 --> 32:24.592
You all right, Prof?

32:24.592 --> 32:27.728
I'm trying to do my regiment proud.

32:27.728 --> 32:29.456
Oh, my nipples are chafing!

32:39.892 --> 32:45.652
Sir, the Prof's made the klaxon
for another circuit.

32:45.652 --> 32:51.024
That's excellent.

32:51.024 --> 32:54.772
I know today didn't quite work out,
Sergeant Lane,

32:54.772 --> 32:58.704
but it could have been
a whole lot worse.

32:58.704 --> 33:00.892
They think we're poisoning
them, you know?

33:00.892 --> 33:03.184
The Afghans.

33:03.184 --> 33:05.452
They think the vaccinations
have got poison in them.

33:05.452 --> 33:08.048
Well, what can we do if they think
everything's a conspiracy?

33:08.048 --> 33:10.544
Yeah, sir, but if I was Afghan
and I saw military force

33:10.544 --> 33:12.892
escorting medics, I think I'd think
something suspicious

33:12.892 --> 33:15.856
was going to go down.

33:15.856 --> 33:17.264
Sir, with all due respect...

33:17.264 --> 33:19.252
Whenever you say,
"With all due respect,"

33:19.252 --> 33:23.092
I know you're about to start
running your mouth.

33:23.092 --> 33:25.852
Look, Dr Bahil wants to go out
unescorted because of us.

33:25.852 --> 33:28.464
Well, then, that's her call
and it's nothing to do with us.

33:28.464 --> 33:31.664
Training and mentoring.
Security within the hospital.

33:31.664 --> 33:33.840
Shouldn't we offer assistance, sir?

33:33.840 --> 33:38.000
This is all about Dr Bahil, is it?

33:38.000 --> 33:51.824
Nothing to do with Omar
and Captain Harte.

33:51.824 --> 33:57.172

the fuck it's all been about?

34:06.928 --> 34:08.976
I mean, look at this place.

34:08.976 --> 34:13.520
You telling me we made
a scrap of difference?

34:13.520 --> 34:16.492

a better place, Kingy.

34:16.492 --> 34:17.616
Didn't you?

34:17.616 --> 34:20.176
Are we making it a worse place?

34:26.000 --> 34:29.812

We haven't made any difference.

34:29.812 --> 34:34.192
Big picture, small picture,
people have died.

34:34.192 --> 34:39.248
We've lost people, Kingy,
and what for?

34:39.248 --> 34:42.532
Georgie.Colour. Sarge.All right,

34:42.532 --> 34:44.944
but the old Prof's still out there
staggering around.

34:44.944 --> 34:48.848
I thought he might need
some medical attention.

34:48.848 --> 34:52.432
I'll make sure the Prof's alive,
yeah? And if he is,

34:52.432 --> 34:57.808
I'll take the piss for us all.
Good man.

34:57.808 --> 34:59.216

38:52.560 --> 38:54.052
I can barely bend my legs.

38:54.052 --> 38:55.824
Just had to take a shit standing up.

38:55.824 --> 38:57.232
Like a cow.

38:57.232 --> 38:58.640
How do you feel, Poya?

38:58.640 --> 39:01.648
Our boy smashed it.
HE CHUCKLES

39:01.648 --> 39:03.952
Brace up.

39:03.952 --> 39:05.488
As you were, guys.

39:05.488 --> 39:08.212
Right, there was good effort,
good focus all round yesterday.

39:08.212 --> 39:10.012
Need you hitting your pits early

39:10.012 --> 39:13.936
because 0400 hours, we launch
Op Homeward Bound. Sir.

39:13.936 --> 39:16.880
Thanks, Colour. Op Homeward Bound.

39:16.880 --> 39:21.172
A security operation to protect
the medics, allied and local,

39:21.172 --> 39:25.456
as they continue with essential
vaccination work in the field.

39:25.456 --> 39:27.292
Dr Bahil is adamant she wants

39:27.292 --> 39:30.960
to travel into the Kowt-e Ashro
region tomorrow. Unescorted.

39:30.960 --> 39:34.416
That means she wants no visible
military presence.

39:34.416 --> 39:39.536
The area is a collection of
small towns with outlying compounds.

39:39.536 --> 39:44.720
But this region allows us to
secrete troops into the mountains,

39:44.720 --> 39:48.240
hidden but with eyes on,
ready to move in an emergency.

39:48.240 --> 39:52.080
So Dr Bahil will be protected,
but at a discreet distance,

39:52.080 --> 39:55.732
which hopefully allows her to do
her job as we do ours.

39:55.732 --> 39:58.544
What has been agreed with
Dr Bahil is that a plain-clothed

39:58.544 --> 40:00.784
military medic
will escort her throughout,

40:00.784 --> 40:04.752
working as close security as well as
   administering vaccinations.

40:04.752 --> 40:09.552
Dr Antonio has offered to
work in this capacity.

40:09.552 --> 40:10.896
Sergeant Lane?

40:10.896 --> 40:13.520
Sir, wouldn't it be better
if that was a female?

40:13.520 --> 40:15.696
Last time, male presence
seemed to cause aggravation.

40:15.696 --> 40:18.448
Dr Antonio has offered to go.
We think that's appropriate.

40:18.448 --> 40:20.816
Yeah, but I have a good working
relationship with Dr Bahil.

40:20.816 --> 40:34.732
And so does Dr Antonio!Sir,
honestly, it mustn't be a male.

40:34.732 --> 40:42.192
Set?Yes, sir.Weapon?

40:42.192 --> 40:45.712
Thank you - for arranging this.

40:45.712 --> 40:51.216
It was Second Lieutenant Hurst,
not me.

40:51.216 --> 40:54.052
I'll keep her safe.

40:54.052 --> 40:59.728
You keep yourself safe, too.

40:59.728 --> 41:05.812
You ready?

41:05.812 --> 41:28.336
ENGINE STARTS

41:28.336 --> 41:47.024
Eyes on ambulance, sir.
They've arrived.

41:47.024 --> 41:51.892
We work in shifts.
We need to keep our medics safe.

41:51.892 --> 41:53.616
We have the addresses
and dates of birth

41:53.616 --> 41:55.132
for all the children in the region.

41:55.132 --> 41:57.652
We visit each dwelling,
insist on treating the children,

41:57.652 --> 42:00.532
do it with speed and efficiency
and move on to the next dwelling.

42:00.532 --> 42:02.092
HURST:Keep a low profile.

42:02.092 --> 42:04.880
Remember, some are hostile to
female medics here.

42:04.880 --> 42:06.772
Communication is key, Sergeant Lane.

42:06.772 --> 42:09.744
While we have light, we can see any
movements in or out of the area.

42:09.744 --> 42:12.052
Homeward bound before dusk.

42:12.052 --> 42:25.616
Darkness renders us
effectively blind.

42:25.616 --> 42:36.304
Vehicle has been stopped, sir.
Two males approaching.

42:36.304 --> 42:55.504
IN PASHTO:

42:55.504 --> 42:57.680
She will just...down
at the first sign of...

42:57.680 --> 43:00.944
She's a soldier,
she knows what she's doing.

43:00.944 --> 43:02.416
I'm just looking out for her.

43:02.416 --> 43:18.352
Stay focused. Any problems,
we need to move quickly.

43:18.352 --> 43:24.432
The two males appear to be
moving away, sir.

43:24.432 --> 43:29.572
You need to hide the watch.

43:29.572 --> 43:31.492
Stay close, Poya, yeah?

43:31.492 --> 43:34.288
One zero alpha,
this is one zero bravo.

43:34.288 --> 43:36.892
Alighting car.

43:36.892 --> 43:38.576
Side arm checked.

43:38.576 --> 43:40.496
Poya monitoring area, over.

43:40.496 --> 43:42.800
One zero bravo to one zero alpha.

43:42.800 --> 43:46.064
Our primary mission is to keep
Dr Bahil safe.Roger.

43:46.064 --> 43:47.472
Thanks for sorting, sir.

43:47.472 --> 43:57.264
That sounded like a thank you,
Kingy.

43:57.264 --> 43:59.952
Remember she's a known target to
local insurgents.

43:59.952 --> 44:16.656
So we really need eyes on. Over.

44:16.656 --> 44:40.656
There are three children here
we need to vaccinate.

44:40.656 --> 44:46.416
Dera manana.Manana.

44:46.416 --> 44:48.208
One zero bravo to one zero alpha.

44:48.208 --> 44:53.136
Repeat. We need eyes on, over.

44:53.136 --> 44:54.892
She's gone inside.

44:54.892 --> 45:06.256
They're not always going to be able
to inoculate from outside, sir.

45:06.256 --> 45:26.096
Let's speed this up.OK.

45:26.096 --> 45:28.656
Manana.

45:28.656 --> 45:38.832
Eyes on, sir.

45:38.832 --> 45:42.480
Sir. Sir, there's a busy fucker
on a moped.

45:42.480 --> 45:46.768
Throbber, how can you not look busy
on a moving moped?

45:46.768 --> 45:49.776
I don't like them
buzzing round like that.

45:49.776 --> 45:54.704
How do we know what they're
thinking? Shall I neutralise?

45:54.704 --> 45:56.944
You going to shoot everyone in
Afghan on a moped,

45:56.944 --> 45:59.824
you're going to need a hell of a lot
  of bullets, that's for sure.

45:59.824 --> 46:02.212
Well, if you want me to, Colour,
it'd be my pleasure.

46:02.212 --> 46:20.752
What on Earth were we thinking,
giving you a weapon?

46:20.752 --> 46:29.212
Well done.

46:29.212 --> 46:31.132
Her temperature's down.

46:31.132 --> 46:32.464
Good.

46:32.464 --> 46:38.332
You are getting better.

46:38.332 --> 46:50.896
Monk?

46:50.896 --> 46:53.584
Here you are, lad,
give us a lug of that.

46:53.584 --> 46:56.212
I'm parched.

46:56.212 --> 47:12.292
Sharing's caring, man.

47:12.292 --> 47:14.896
We've finished this area.
About to move on, sir.

47:14.896 --> 47:17.456
Roger that, out.

47:17.456 --> 47:19.184
Colour.

47:19.184 --> 47:20.336
Boss.

47:20.336 --> 47:24.052
As soon as you've finished your
scoff, I want you, Fingers,

47:24.052 --> 47:26.692
Throbber to switch focus
to south of the village.

47:26.692 --> 47:30.384
Boss.

47:30.384 --> 47:31.984
Lane's moving shortly.

47:31.984 --> 47:57.904
We need to have eyes on
any potential threats.

47:57.904 --> 48:05.264
Bring me the list.

48:05.264 --> 48:09.052
Thank you.

48:09.052 --> 48:11.728
Lane, we have eyes on south village.

48:11.728 --> 48:16.016
Keep vigilant for threats
to Dr Bahil.

48:16.016 --> 48:20.692
Remember, compounds of
interest are...

48:20.692 --> 48:27.664
One five five, one two eight,
one one four, one seven nine.

48:27.664 --> 48:30.652
What's a compound of
interest, Colour?

48:30.652 --> 48:37.372
Known insurgent activity within.

48:37.372 --> 48:40.144
Antonio told me
you requested to join me.

48:40.144 --> 48:41.936
Thank you.

48:41.936 --> 48:45.968
Well, it was either do this
or my roots again.

48:45.968 --> 48:49.168
I shouldn't have said what I said
about your fiance.

48:49.168 --> 48:51.664
HORN HONKS

48:51.664 --> 48:54.928
I'm sure there's a part of you
that wants revenge.

48:54.928 --> 48:57.772
They shot my husband in the street
like a sick dog.

48:57.772 --> 49:00.944
Bang. Walked away.

49:00.944 --> 49:06.000
I'll get my revenge
by carrying on his work.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.240
My fiance was killed on
a mission to get Omar.

49:08.240 --> 49:10.864
And that's why Afghanistan
has drawn you back.

49:10.864 --> 49:12.912
No, they just send me here.

49:12.912 --> 49:15.984
The British Army is all over the
world and you chose to come here.

49:15.984 --> 49:17.968
It's just chance.

49:17.968 --> 49:19.252
You volunteered.

49:19.252 --> 49:43.376
These things don't happen by chance.

49:43.376 --> 49:47.664
Sir, Giti's gone. Her bed's empty.
Where is she?

49:47.664 --> 49:49.456
Is she not on the ward?

49:49.456 --> 49:51.504
Maybe someone's taken her
to the wash block.

49:51.504 --> 49:53.488
Her uncle came.

49:53.488 --> 49:55.024
What do you mean her uncle came?

49:55.024 --> 49:56.496
He took her.

49:56.496 --> 49:57.776
Well, he can't just take her

49:57.776 --> 49:59.824
cos she's not ready
to be discharged yet.

49:59.824 --> 50:02.256
She needs 24-hour care,
he can't just take her.

50:02.256 --> 50:09.424
Well, he saw a sign. Your sign.

50:09.424 --> 50:11.216
Is he allowed to just take her, sir?

50:11.216 --> 50:15.568
What can we do if the family
decide to take her home?

50:15.568 --> 50:20.368
Did you even try and persuade him
not to take her?

50:20.368 --> 50:22.612
How do we know that
she's being looked after?

50:22.612 --> 50:25.424
Cos we don't know where she is so
she could have been taken anywhere.

50:25.424 --> 50:28.304
What are we going to do?
We carry on.

50:28.304 --> 50:47.760
Get on with your duties, soldier.

50:47.760 --> 51:12.892
INAUDIBLE

51:12.892 --> 51:15.088
Straight to zero.
We're losing the light.

51:15.088 --> 51:16.852
Security vehicles will be monitoring

51:16.852 --> 51:25.372
and following once you're
outside the town. Out.

51:25.372 --> 51:28.612
Infidel!

51:28.612 --> 51:44.592
INDISTINCT SHOUTING

51:44.592 --> 51:50.332
One zero bravo to one zero alpha.
Dusk closing in. Prepare to move.

51:50.332 --> 51:52.784
I need you withdrawing
and heading back to zero, over.

51:52.784 --> 51:57.456
Roger that. Out.

51:57.456 --> 51:59.184
We need to head straight to zero.

51:59.184 --> 52:01.808
You're not allowed to leave
the vehicle for any reason.

52:01.808 --> 52:10.768
It's getting dark soon
and they won't have eyes on.

52:10.768 --> 52:12.688
Sir. Excuse me, sir.

52:12.688 --> 52:14.288
There's one particular moped.

52:14.288 --> 52:17.332
It's been following them.

52:17.332 --> 52:20.816
I clocked it a while ago.

52:20.816 --> 52:22.612
Stay in the vehicle.

52:22.612 --> 52:24.656
Go straight to zero...
STATIC ON RADIO

52:24.656 --> 52:29.520
Stay near the...

52:29.520 --> 52:31.824
You're being followed.
Leave immediately.

52:31.824 --> 52:34.640
I repeat, leave immediately.

52:34.640 --> 52:39.056
Nice one, Prof.

52:39.056 --> 52:41.332
It's the woman from the other day
at the school.

52:41.332 --> 52:44.752
With the irate husband.

52:44.752 --> 52:48.656
No, don't...

52:48.656 --> 52:50.256
Sir, they've got out.

52:50.256 --> 52:56.144
Stay in the vehicle, keep moving.
Repeat, stay in the vehicle, over.

52:56.144 --> 53:00.652
Suspect following on foot, sir.

53:00.652 --> 53:01.904
She's not responding.

53:01.904 --> 53:06.128
Sir, Lane has company -
and they're armed.

53:06.128 --> 53:08.176
We need to get to the village now.

53:08.176 --> 53:09.776
Everybody on me.

53:09.776 --> 53:15.664
Let's double away -
zeros, fives and twenties.

53:15.664 --> 53:17.264
She wants us to inoculate
her children.

53:17.264 --> 53:18.892
Get the bag and let's do it quickly.

53:18.892 --> 53:21.172
Poya, stay close.
I'll be right there.

53:21.172 --> 53:22.972
Monk, let's go.

53:22.972 --> 53:50.608
Lane. Lane, multiple insurgents
approaching. Do you copy?

53:50.608 --> 53:59.092
Sir. Sir, we need to get
to Georgie and Dr Bahil.

53:59.092 --> 54:12.112
Bag.

54:12.112 --> 54:22.992
There are two children here.
I'll inoculate them.

54:22.992 --> 54:26.256
She has a fractured eye socket.
We need to get her to a hospital.

54:26.256 --> 54:27.772
Not our immediate business.

54:27.772 --> 54:29.264
Shall we take her and the children?

54:29.264 --> 54:34.064
We cannot interfere in their lives.

54:34.064 --> 54:35.216
GUN COCKS

54:35.216 --> 54:37.904
WHISPERING: Shit.

54:37.904 --> 54:45.840
Come, come.That's it. That's it.

54:45.840 --> 54:51.536
HE GRUNTS

54:51.536 --> 54:52.752
GUNSHOT

54:52.752 --> 55:00.240
Shit.

55:00.240 --> 55:03.120
Throbber, easy!

55:03.120 --> 55:05.744
Follow me. Keep low.

55:05.744 --> 55:07.612
GUNFIRE

55:07.612 --> 55:18.416
We're being ambushed. Move. Move!

55:18.416 --> 55:22.640
HURST:At least five insurgents
surrounding Lane.

55:22.640 --> 55:26.096
Engage at will!

55:26.096 --> 55:28.912
We have to get them
back to the vehicle!

55:28.912 --> 55:40.624
Right, move, move, move.

55:40.624 --> 55:43.132
Throbber, they're round that corner!

55:43.132 --> 55:45.172
Coming through, coming through!

55:45.172 --> 55:48.652
GUNFIRE

55:48.652 --> 55:52.528
Prof on me! On me!

55:52.528 --> 56:07.252
Order, order, protect Georgie!

56:07.252 --> 56:10.384
I'm pinned down!

56:10.384 --> 56:15.824
Keep your head down. Move them away!
        Keep to the door!

56:15.824 --> 56:21.136
Come on!

56:21.136 --> 56:23.120
Clear!

56:23.120 --> 56:25.104
Right, let's move. Move!
SHE GASPS

56:25.104 --> 56:27.216
Right, come, come.
Follow me, follow me.

56:27.216 --> 56:31.696
Monk! Kingy! On Lane! On Lane!

56:31.696 --> 56:32.720
INDISTINCT SHOUTING

56:32.720 --> 56:35.984
Stay down.

56:35.984 --> 56:40.656
Clear the alley, clear the alley!

56:40.656 --> 56:43.492
MAN YELLS

56:43.492 --> 56:48.532
Clear! Move, move, move!
Right, let's go.

56:48.532 --> 56:53.392
Kingy, on Lane!

56:53.392 --> 56:56.464
GUNFIRE CONTINUES

MUSIC: I Put A Flame In Your Heart
(Vessels Remix) by Matt Emery

57:03.696 --> 57:06.292
ECHOING:Prof, you've killed
the last one!

57:06.292 --> 57:09.456
Prof, on me!

57:09.456 --> 57:16.496
All clear. Get her to the vehicle.

57:16.496 --> 57:20.212
Get in the car. Get in.

57:20.212 --> 57:23.932
Poya... Wait!

57:23.932 --> 57:28.464
Where are you going?!

57:28.464 --> 57:32.112
Poya! She's gone! They've got her!

57:32.112 --> 57:36.464
Kingy! Poya.
# I put a flame in your heart... #

57:36.464 --> 57:39.344
They've got her. Kingy!
# Now it burns for two... #

57:39.344 --> 57:42.096
All right, Poya. Shit!

57:42.096 --> 57:44.592
# I put a flame in your heart... #
She's gone. They've got her.

57:44.592 --> 57:47.092
All right, two section!

57:47.092 --> 57:50.288
All round to base. 360.
# Now it burns for two... #

57:50.288 --> 57:51.892
Keep breathing, just keep breathing.

57:51.892 --> 57:57.008
Keep breathing, just keep breathing.
  # I put a flame in your heart

57:57.008 --> 58:00.912
# Now it burns for you. #

58:00.912 --> 58:05.932
Shit.

58:05.932 --> 58:08.572
Unless the elections are called off,

58:08.572 --> 58:09.892
I will be killed.

58:09.892 --> 58:12.432
Come on. We've got to do
something here.

58:12.432 --> 58:13.852
It's down to me.

58:13.852 --> 58:16.080
I mean, was I that determined
to get to Omar?

58:16.080 --> 58:19.536
Her emotional involvement makes
unpleasant listening, Mr Hurst.

58:19.536 --> 58:25.872
GUNSHOT AND SHOUTING

58:25.872 --> 58:28.048
I don't think I can do
this any more, Fingers.

58:28.048 --> 58:32.144
# I put a flame in your heart

58:32.144 --> 58:38.032
# Now it burns for you

58:38.032 --> 58:42.448
# I put a flame in your heart

58:42.448 --> 58:49.168
# Now it burns for you

58:49.168 --> 58:52.752
# I put a flame in your heart
