00:14.120 --> 00:18.238
- Any problems getting the canisters out?
- No. They were exactly where you said.

00:18.320 --> 00:21.357
The Russians will learn the
consequences of occupying our homeland

00:21.440 --> 00:23.317
when we turn Moscow into a graveyard.

00:23.640 --> 00:25.835
Erwich has just cleared airport security.

00:25.920 --> 00:28.673
<i>- And the authorities don't know anything?
- Not yet.</i>

00:28.760 --> 00:30.398
The only thing left to take care of is Bauer.

00:30.480 --> 00:32.914
- You paged me?
- I need you to do something.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.629
- We've our hands full searching for the gas.
- Bauer is a priority.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.629
I just signed a treaty. Now I find
the terrorists are still out there.

00:40.720 --> 00:42.597
With nerve gas.

00:42.680 --> 00:45.319
You people have to listen to me.

00:45.400 --> 00:48.597
I had a document.
It was hidden in my blouse.

00:48.680 --> 00:51.035
It's gone. Someone stole it from me.

00:51.440 --> 00:54.159
This is what she was like before Vermont.

00:54.240 --> 00:57.789
- Are you suggesting that I readmit her?
- Consider the option, for her sake.

00:59.040 --> 01:01.793
<i>- My wife is gone.
- We have a priority alert.</i>

01:02.160 --> 01:06.438
You've been burrowing into classified
CTU protocols without authorisation.

01:06.520 --> 01:11.389
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Stop. You logged onto the subsystem.

01:11.480 --> 01:13.630
Someone knew that Jack was alive.

01:13.720 --> 01:17.076
It's critical to our investigation
that we find out who that was.

01:21.440 --> 01:23.233
Did you let that man into CTU?

01:23.318 --> 01:26.878
This man is a professional
assassin. He killed Dr Paulson.

01:26.960 --> 01:29.269
Who told you to let that man into CTU?

01:29.360 --> 01:30.679
The White House.

01:30.760 --> 01:32.751
Mr Cummings.

01:39.600 --> 01:44.958
Palmer was murdered because he was about
to expose Cummings' link to the terrorists.

01:45.040 --> 01:47.918
When Cummings failed
to frame me for it, he tried to kill me.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.877
Jack, we don't have proof.

01:49.960 --> 01:53.077
We can prove Cummings used Spenser
to get Jack's assassin in.

01:53.160 --> 01:55.310
Spenser's word isn't enough to build a case.

01:55.400 --> 01:58.836
You don't have time. You want the gas,
Cummings is your connection.

01:58.920 --> 02:02.435
Cummings is the president's chief advisor.
How do we get to him?

02:02.520 --> 02:04.988
I secretly meet Mike Novick. Enlist his help.

02:05.080 --> 02:07.071
How do we know Novick's not in this?

02:07.160 --> 02:09.878
Because I know him. He'll listen to me.

02:09.960 --> 02:13.669
The president will listen to him.
With Novick, we can isolate Cummings.

02:13.760 --> 02:16.877
Jack, much as I appreciate this,
you don't work here any more.

02:16.960 --> 02:19.758
That's exactly the reason
why I should do this.

02:19.840 --> 02:23.310
If it backfires, there'll
be no fallout on you.

02:24.240 --> 02:26.879
- I think it's worth a try.
- I agree.

02:28.280 --> 02:30.077
It's your call.

02:39.600 --> 02:41.397
All right, Jack.

02:41.480 --> 02:45.678
But this is about finding the nerve gas,
not getting revenge for David Palmer.

02:45.760 --> 02:46.954
Understood.

02:48.760 --> 02:54.756
Work out your protocols with Ms Raines.
We'll look through Cummings' background.

02:55.800 --> 02:59.270
I'm gonna need to set up a secure channel
for you to contact us on.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.152
<i>OK.</i>

03:02.240 --> 03:05.277
Can you bring up a satellite photo
of the compound?

03:08.840 --> 03:12.116
Jack, I'm sorry
if I'm being a little distant. I just...

03:12.200 --> 03:16.159
It's taking me a little while
to get used to you being alive.

03:17.840 --> 03:19.831
I understand.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.156
I'll call Novick.

03:25.240 --> 03:27.037
Jack.

03:30.760 --> 03:35.754
When Cummings finds out that you're
still alive, he's gonna come after you again.

03:35.840 --> 03:37.512
Yeah.

03:48.480 --> 03:50.311
<i>- Yes?
- Is Bauer dead?</i>

03:50.400 --> 03:52.630
I haven't received confirmation yet.

03:52.720 --> 03:54.870
Your man should have taken care of it.

03:54.960 --> 03:59.078
Perhaps he had to alter his strike window.
Has the nerve gas reached the port?

03:59.160 --> 04:02.232
Not yet.
But it should be arriving any minute.

04:02.320 --> 04:03.469
Good.

04:03.560 --> 04:06.438
I have to go. I'm late for a briefing.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.950
You have the shipping documents in order?

04:16.040 --> 04:18.553
The canisters will arrive
in port in eight days.

04:18.640 --> 04:22.758
Ground transportation to your base camp
will take another day.

04:22.840 --> 04:25.638
- Do you need help getting them to the target?
- No.

04:25.720 --> 04:28.075
I've arranged transport to Moscow.

04:38.520 --> 04:42.149
- Would you put this on now?
- Have they found my wife yet?

04:42.240 --> 04:45.277
No. Secret Service is confident
she's still on the grounds.

04:45.360 --> 04:48.636
If they're so damn confident,
why can't anyone find her?

04:48.720 --> 04:51.359
I'm sure it's just a matter of time,
Mr President.

04:51.440 --> 04:55.672
- Sorry I'm late.
- I was just setting up the video.

04:55.760 --> 05:00.470
This was made by terrorists to document
the effects of exposure to nerve gas.

05:00.560 --> 05:04.439
It was recovered from a training camp
two years ago.

05:04.520 --> 05:08.035
Disorientation occurs
moments after exposure.

05:10.160 --> 05:14.790
Now the video jumps forward. No more
than a couple of minutes, we estimate.

05:14.880 --> 05:18.839
Within that time, there's permanent damage
to the central nervous system.

05:18.920 --> 05:23.994
Violent seizures take over,
bronchial membranes blister, peel away.

05:24.080 --> 05:26.799
- Death occurs within...
- Stop.

05:29.560 --> 05:33.997
Now, according to DOD,
the Sentox-6 nerve gas stolen from the airport

05:34.080 --> 05:37.231
is far more lethal
than the gas we just saw used.

05:37.320 --> 05:40.073
If released in a town or city, for example,

05:40.160 --> 05:43.277
the cloud will remain lethal for much longer.

05:44.800 --> 05:47.758
Are we any closer to finding the canisters?

05:47.840 --> 05:51.037
There haven't been
any reports of progress, sir.

05:53.080 --> 05:55.230
Excuse me, Mr President.

05:55.320 --> 05:59.154
I need to return a call
to the State Department.

05:59.880 --> 06:02.713
Do you have those updates, Walt?

06:02.800 --> 06:04.870
Yes, here's one from CTU.

06:06.920 --> 06:10.037
Also one from Homeland Security.

06:15.880 --> 06:17.871
<i>- This is Bauer.
- Jack, Mike Novick.</i>

06:17.960 --> 06:19.712
It's good to hear your voice.

06:19.800 --> 06:21.791
Yours too, Mike.

06:22.680 --> 06:25.990
So sorry about David Palmer.
I know how much he meant to you.

06:26.080 --> 06:27.877
Yeah.

06:27.960 --> 06:29.552
What's going on?

06:29.640 --> 06:32.108
I have a lead on the stolen nerve gas.

06:32.200 --> 06:34.395
Isn't CTU coordinating the search?

06:34.480 --> 06:37.631
This is something
I need to bring directly to you.

06:37.720 --> 06:41.838
- I don't understand.
- I can't talk about it on the phone, Mike.

06:41.920 --> 06:46.436
We need to meet. No one can know about this,
not even the president.

06:46.520 --> 06:49.034
I'm not comfortable
with all this secrecy, Jack.

06:49.120 --> 06:52.032
<i>You need to give me
some idea of what this is about.</i>

06:52.120 --> 06:54.429
It concerns Walt Cummings.

06:55.280 --> 06:57.236
Ah.

06:57.320 --> 07:01.996
There's an area a few hundred yards
outside the southwest gate,

07:02.080 --> 07:04.674
at the far side of the property
from the main house.

07:04.760 --> 07:07.035
Thanks, Mike. I'll see you in 15 minutes.

07:11.360 --> 07:14.158
- Jack.
- Hey.

07:14.240 --> 07:16.993
- They say we can leave soon.
- I know. I heard.

07:17.080 --> 07:19.674
Well, what about you?
Are you coming home with us?

07:19.760 --> 07:23.435
No, I need to stay here.
CTU still needs my help.

07:24.640 --> 07:27.632
I'd like to speak with your mom
for a moment. All right?

07:27.720 --> 07:31.838
- Yeah, of course.
- Take him downstairs. She'll be there soon.

07:38.720 --> 07:41.473
You're not coming back to us, are you?

07:42.480 --> 07:43.913
No.

07:47.320 --> 07:50.278
I never thought
I was gonna be back here at CTU.

07:50.360 --> 07:55.878
I would never have gotten you involved
in all of this, I promise you.

07:56.880 --> 08:02.238
It's the woman who interviewed me, isn't it?
Audrey Raines?

08:02.320 --> 08:05.357
You were involved with her.

08:05.440 --> 08:08.716
I could tell
by the way you looked at each other.

08:09.720 --> 08:12.951
I was with her before I had to disappear.

08:13.960 --> 08:16.520
Are you still in love with her?

08:18.120 --> 08:20.236
Yes.

08:22.600 --> 08:25.273
Does she still love you?

08:26.280 --> 08:28.350
I don't know.

08:28.440 --> 08:31.796
Mr Bauer?
Your transportation's standing by.

08:31.880 --> 08:33.871
I'll be right there.

08:36.559 --> 08:38.471
I'm sorry. I have to go.

08:39.080 --> 08:41.071
Yeah.

08:49.880 --> 08:51.871
Thank you.

08:54.080 --> 08:56.071
Yeah.

08:57.360 --> 08:59.191
Thank you.

09:05.360 --> 09:07.920
<i>I'm not comfortable
with all this secrecy, Jack.</i>

09:08.000 --> 09:10.275
<i>You need to give me
some idea what this is about.</i>

09:10.360 --> 09:12.999
<i>It concerns Walt Cummings.</i>

09:13.080 --> 09:17.312
There 's an area a few hundred yards
outside the southwest gate,

09:17.400 --> 09:20.472
<i>at the far side of the property
from the main house,</i>

09:20.560 --> 09:22.915
- Your man didn't do his job.
- Don't put that on me.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.673
You were supposed
to have Bauer killed hours ago.

09:25.760 --> 09:29.639
I'm not gonna warn you again.
Pull yourself together.

09:29.720 --> 09:34.555
You heard the call, didn't you? Bauer's
coming here to expose my role in all this.

09:34.640 --> 09:37.950
- You're assuming he knows it all.
- It's obvious he knows enough.

09:38.040 --> 09:39.951
Now what the hell am I supposed to do?

09:40.040 --> 09:44.636
At this point,
there's only one thing you can do.

10:19.280 --> 10:22.272
Mrs Logan. Please come out of there.

10:23.880 --> 10:25.871
Mrs Logan.

10:30.320 --> 10:34.199
Aaron, don't let them take me.
You've got to listen to me.

10:34.280 --> 10:38.432
- They're just trying to help you.
- No. No, they're trying to set me up.

10:38.520 --> 10:42.149
They're trying to make it look like
I had a breakdown so they can cart me off.

10:42.240 --> 10:43.958
- Ma'am, they're...
- Aaron.

10:44.040 --> 10:46.554
It's someone in my husband's administration.

10:46.640 --> 10:50.872
They're trying to shut me up
because I know the truth.

10:50.960 --> 10:54.077
- What truth?
- David Palmer.

10:54.160 --> 10:55.559
I know...

10:59.320 --> 11:04.075
- Don't let them take me, Aaron. Please.
- We have our orders, Mrs Logan. I'm sorry.

11:04.160 --> 11:05.752
Aaron?

11:05.840 --> 11:07.831
Please?

11:09.880 --> 11:11.871
Aaron.

11:34.480 --> 11:36.869
Audrey. Did you check with the airports?

11:36.960 --> 11:39.679
- Yes. They've all been alerted.
- And CHP?

11:39.760 --> 11:42.149
Trucks are being checked at all interstates.

11:42.240 --> 11:44.993
Make sure the gas isn't mentioned.
The White House was clear.

11:45.080 --> 11:49.517
I know. The bulletin only describes the
canisters. No mention of chemical weapons.

11:49.600 --> 11:54.549
The last thing we need is for the public
to find out that nerve gas is out there.

12:37.320 --> 12:40.278
Schaeffer.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.793
What are you doing in there?

12:41.880 --> 12:44.348
Making sure the canisters
were secured properly.

12:44.440 --> 12:46.874
Don't want 'em knocking around on the ship.

12:46.960 --> 12:51.397
My men secured the canisters according to
my instructions. You needn't be concerned.

12:51.480 --> 12:55.871
All right. Here are the customs documents
you need when the shipment arrives,

12:55.960 --> 13:01.637
along with the remote trigger, and the arming
codes. I'll take the rest of my payment now.

13:01.720 --> 13:05.679
Our arrangement was you get your final
instalment when the ship left port.

13:05.760 --> 13:08.752
That won't be a problem.
They're loading in less than an hour.

13:08.840 --> 13:10.990
Then you won't have long to wait.

13:12.240 --> 13:14.800
Fine.

13:31.520 --> 13:34.432
I'll be right there.

13:34.520 --> 13:36.909
- Ms Raines?
- Yes?

13:37.000 --> 13:39.560
- We've been released.
- Oh, good.

13:42.040 --> 13:44.554
- Can I ask you something?
- Of course.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.839
Do you still have feelings for Jack?

13:52.120 --> 13:54.111
- I'm sorry, that's personal.
- I know.

13:54.200 --> 13:58.751
But he's been living with my son and me
for the last six months.

13:58.840 --> 14:01.593
We started to become a family.

14:04.360 --> 14:06.749
And I care about him.

14:08.680 --> 14:11.069
Do you know he still loves you?

14:16.880 --> 14:19.952
If you don't love him, let him go.

14:48.120 --> 14:51.271
- Bauer.
- Jack, it's Audrey.

14:51.360 --> 14:53.351
What's going on?

14:54.880 --> 14:56.757
Jack...

14:58.120 --> 15:00.111
What?

15:01.480 --> 15:03.471
Audrey, what?

15:07.120 --> 15:09.714
When this is over, are you coming back?

15:15.600 --> 15:16.794
I don't know.

15:18.640 --> 15:20.915
Are you going back to Diane?

15:21.000 --> 15:24.834
No. I... I don't know what I'm doing yet.

15:24.920 --> 15:27.150
<i>I haven't had any time to think about it,</i>

15:27.240 --> 15:30.437
- Is it true, what she said?
- What'd she say?

15:31.280 --> 15:33.714
That you still love me.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.159
I never stopped loving you.

15:43.840 --> 15:46.035
Not for one second.

15:46.120 --> 15:49.396
Then don't go away again, Jack. Please.

15:51.000 --> 15:55.312
- It's more complicated than that.
- I know.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.672
It's time.

16:01.760 --> 16:05.275
<i>- I've gotta go.
- Jack...</i>

16:05.360 --> 16:09.194
- I have to go.
- Yeah, I know. I know. OK. Bye.

16:24.040 --> 16:25.871
No, no. Keep me outta this.

16:25.960 --> 16:30.112
The last thing I want to do is comment
to the press about the roadblocks going up.

16:30.200 --> 16:35.115
And we can't have any leaks about
the nerve gas. It would just cause a panic.

16:35.200 --> 16:36.679
Come in.

16:36.760 --> 16:39.513
- Pardon me, we've found Mrs Logan.
- Is she all right?

16:39.600 --> 16:43.195
She's fine, sir.
She was hiding in the stables.

16:43.280 --> 16:46.989
The stables.
What the hell did she think she was doing?

16:47.080 --> 16:49.640
Mr President.

16:49.720 --> 16:53.076
I feel awkward mentioning this, but...

16:53.160 --> 16:55.355
Mrs Logan said some things.

16:55.440 --> 16:57.510
- About David Palmer?
- Yes, sir.

16:59.040 --> 17:02.316
I've heard her conspiracy theories, Aaron.

17:05.680 --> 17:08.478
I've heard them all.

17:08.560 --> 17:11.790
But thank you for your concern, Aaron.

17:18.400 --> 17:20.470
They found my wife.

17:21.560 --> 17:23.949
Good.

17:26.839 --> 17:28.831
Mr President.

17:29.840 --> 17:32.673
We need to talk.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.876
What is it, Walt?

17:34.960 --> 17:39.397
I was hoping to spare you from this,
but I'm afraid Jack Bauer's forcing my hand.

17:39.480 --> 17:42.836
He's on his way here
to meet with Mike Novick.

17:42.920 --> 17:45.229
Bauer? Why?

17:45.320 --> 17:48.357
To accuse me of helping the terrorists
acquire the nerve gas.

17:48.440 --> 17:50.556
That's ridiculous.

17:50.640 --> 17:52.232
No, sir.

17:52.320 --> 17:55.278
It's the truth.

17:55.360 --> 17:57.590
What did you say?

17:57.680 --> 18:02.310
Through a proxy, I leaked information to the
terrorists about where the gas was hidden.

18:02.400 --> 18:05.631
This gas was never
gonna pose a threat to American lives...

18:05.720 --> 18:07.836
Never pose a threat?

18:07.920 --> 18:10.957
People died in the airport.
Hostages were killed.

18:11.040 --> 18:15.875
- We had hoped to limit the collateral damage.
- What are you thinking?

18:15.960 --> 18:18.030
This is an unspeakable crime.

18:22.800 --> 18:24.677
Walt.

18:25.680 --> 18:28.353
- You have to answer for this.
- Mr President.

18:28.440 --> 18:33.639
It's in your best interest to hear me out
before you make that phone call.

18:33.720 --> 18:36.280
What do you mean, "my best interest"?

18:36.760 --> 18:38.990
The gas is being smuggled out of the country

18:39.080 --> 18:42.516
by separatists who think they're
going to use it against the Russians.

18:42.600 --> 18:45.672
However, that nerve gas
will never reach Russian soil.

18:45.760 --> 18:47.910
And you know this how?

18:48.000 --> 18:50.798
We control the remote detonators
on those canisters.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.127
As soon as they reach
the terrorist base,

18:53.212 --> 18:55.749
we'll trigger the canisters
and release the gas.

18:55.840 --> 18:58.308
What happened today
was just to kill terrorists?

18:58.400 --> 19:01.631
No, the goal is to produce a smoking gun.

19:01.720 --> 19:07.352
Proof of the existence of
weapons of mass destruction in central Asia.

19:07.440 --> 19:10.830
- This is unbelievable.
- No. It's necessary.

19:10.920 --> 19:14.390
It will give us a pretext to increase
our military presence there,

19:14.480 --> 19:17.870
guaranteeing the flow of oil
for the next generation.

19:17.960 --> 19:22.317
How dare you?
How dare you act without my consent?

19:22.400 --> 19:27.520
How dare you put this administration,
this entire country, in jeopardy?

19:27.600 --> 19:29.909
- You're a traitor.
- No.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.389
No, Mr President, I am a patriot!

19:32.480 --> 19:38.919
Doing what needs to be done for the
continued safety and wellbeing of this nation.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.275
My God.

19:41.360 --> 19:44.158
You gave the order
to have David Palmer killed.

19:44.240 --> 19:47.312
That was an unfortunate,
but necessary, intervention.

19:47.400 --> 19:50.631
- He found out too much. We had...
- Walt.

19:50.720 --> 19:54.429
You're rationalising murder.
The murder of a president.

19:54.520 --> 19:57.876
Contact these people,
recover the gas before it leaves the country.

19:57.960 --> 20:00.474
- I'm afraid I can't do that.
- Why not?

20:00.560 --> 20:04.155
I don't know where the gas is.
The man I have working inside has gone dark.

20:04.240 --> 20:06.390
He's unreachable.

20:06.840 --> 20:10.799
Now, you let things play out as they are.

20:10.880 --> 20:14.190
Otherwise, your administration
will be implicated,

20:14.280 --> 20:17.431
and your presidency will be destroyed.

20:18.240 --> 20:21.232
It's your choice, Mr President.

21:06.560 --> 21:08.516
Jack.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.273
Thanks for seeing me like this, Mike.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.673
What is it?

21:14.760 --> 21:18.355
- Did you tell anyone we were meeting?
- Of course not.

21:23.760 --> 21:26.957
Son of a bitch. Who did you tell?

21:27.040 --> 21:30.635
- Who did you tell?
- I didn't tell anybody, Jack.

21:30.720 --> 21:33.951
<i>Jack Bauer. Stay right where you are.</i>

21:36.760 --> 21:41.151
<i>- Put down your weapon.
- Tell your men to stand down!</i>

21:41.240 --> 21:43.674
- Sir, we can't do that.
- He's here at my request.

21:43.760 --> 21:46.194
We have orders to use force if necessary.

21:46.280 --> 21:50.717
- Orders? From who?
- The president of the United States.

21:55.880 --> 21:57.871
Get on your knees.

22:04.640 --> 22:08.679
<i>Affirmative, sir, Bauer was
apprehended with no resistance on his part.</i>

22:08.760 --> 22:13.356
<i>- We're transporting him back to the retreat.
- Thanks.</i>

22:16.280 --> 22:18.794
Novick and Bauer
have been taken into custody.

22:18.880 --> 22:21.917
- So we're just gonna lock Mike Novick up?
- For the time being.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.151
What good will it do?
Eventually, he's gonna talk to the press.

22:25.240 --> 22:29.995
- What can he say? He doesn't know anything.
- You told me he talked to Jack Bauer.

22:30.080 --> 22:33.311
We stopped Bauer
before he could give Mike any details.

22:33.400 --> 22:36.551
What's he gonna think? We're detaining him.

22:36.640 --> 22:40.394
Bauer was about to divulge secrets
that Mike's not authorised to hear.

22:40.480 --> 22:43.278
That's why Mike's being detained.

22:43.360 --> 22:49.310
What about Bauer? He must have talked to
people at CTU and told them what he knows.

22:49.400 --> 22:52.870
As soon as this nerve gas leaves US soil,

22:52.960 --> 22:58.956
it's gonna be very difficult to prove that
either of us is connected to this in any way.

22:59.040 --> 23:01.793
Are you sure these detonators will work?

23:01.880 --> 23:05.316
The gas will be released
before it can be used against the Russians?

23:05.400 --> 23:07.197
Yes.

23:07.280 --> 23:12.673
Right now, all you need to do is authorise me
to terminate CTU's involvement in this matter.

23:12.760 --> 23:16.958
Tell them we've got the situation
under control and that we'll deal with Bauer.

23:17.040 --> 23:21.511
Who, after all, is not
officially affiliated with them any longer.

23:25.600 --> 23:27.352
All right.

23:27.440 --> 23:28.589
Good.

23:36.480 --> 23:40.473
<i>- Yes?
- Mr President, Mrs Logan for you.</i>

23:42.520 --> 23:44.511
<i>- Not now.
- Yes, sir.</i>

24:15.840 --> 24:17.273
Dunley.

24:18.720 --> 24:23.475
What is Jack Bauer doing here, why is
he under arrest, and why wasn't I told?

24:23.560 --> 24:25.915
- Orders of the president.
- Directly?

24:26.000 --> 24:29.549
No, they came
through Walt Cummings' office.

24:30.560 --> 24:32.790
OK. Thank you.

24:37.920 --> 24:42.152
We're no longer on the search for the
canisters. We've been ordered off by Division.

24:42.240 --> 24:43.434
Why?

24:43.520 --> 24:45.670
The White House wants to use their people.

24:45.760 --> 24:50.675
- That doesn't make sense. We'll waste hours.
- I know. The president's not taking my calls.

24:50.760 --> 24:54.958
- What about Mike Novick?
- Unreachable. Jack's cell goes to voicemail.

24:55.040 --> 24:58.476
- Something's wrong.
- I know. But I don't know what we can do.

24:58.560 --> 25:00.551
- I do.
- What?

25:00.640 --> 25:03.996
- Disregard the order.
- We won't disregard a presidential order.

25:04.080 --> 25:06.150
If we don't, we won't find this nerve gas.

25:06.240 --> 25:09.630
Sending Jack to Mike Novick
as a private citizen is one thing.

25:09.720 --> 25:12.871
But I'm not about to disobey
a direct order from the White House.

25:12.960 --> 25:18.830
That's because you don't have
the experience to know any better.

25:18.920 --> 25:22.993
Mr Buchanan,
would you step outside for a moment?

25:27.400 --> 25:29.914
- I can't have you talking like that.
- Sorry.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.912
- Are we clear about who's in charge?
- My advice stands.

25:33.000 --> 25:37.437
If this order jeopardises our chances
of finding that gas, you must ignore it.

25:37.520 --> 25:41.354
At least until we can
bring our case to the White House.

25:41.440 --> 25:43.556
- You need to make decisions faster.
- Bill.

25:43.640 --> 25:46.757
One more thing that comes with experience.

25:46.840 --> 25:49.410
If we don't do
everything in our power

25:49.495 --> 25:52.836
to stop these terrorists,
we're not doing our job.

25:56.520 --> 25:59.512
- OK. Disregard the order.
- Thank you.

26:02.760 --> 26:06.070
<i>Is there anything else
you'd like me to pack for you?</i>

26:06.160 --> 26:08.958
Maybe a few of your nicer dresses?

26:10.640 --> 26:13.393
I'm being confined
to a psychiatric ward, Evelyn.

26:13.480 --> 26:16.597
I don't think
there are gonna be any black-tie events.

26:16.680 --> 26:18.511
Sorry.

26:20.720 --> 26:22.711
How'd this happen?

26:24.360 --> 26:27.272
What's that, Mrs Logan?

26:27.360 --> 26:29.351
Charles and me.

26:31.560 --> 26:33.551
I was his confidante.

26:35.080 --> 26:41.428
All his years in Congress, my opinion
was the one that mattered most to him.

26:43.040 --> 26:45.031
Now I'm...

26:47.080 --> 26:49.958
Iess than an afterthought.

26:50.040 --> 26:54.033
I'm sure the president
would be here if he could.

26:55.920 --> 26:59.037
He's the president
of the United States, Evelyn.

26:59.120 --> 27:01.680
He can do whatever he wants.

27:01.760 --> 27:04.228
If he wanted to be here, he would be.

27:21.200 --> 27:24.749
Mr Bauer. You're being moved,
per the president's orders.

27:24.840 --> 27:27.195
- Where?
- To a class three detention facility.

27:27.280 --> 27:30.875
On what charges?
I was invited here by Mike Novick.

27:30.960 --> 27:33.554
Those are my orders, sir.

27:35.200 --> 27:38.715
You're Pierce, right? Aaron Pierce.
You served under David Palmer.

27:38.800 --> 27:41.439
- Yes, I did.
- I need to speak with you for a moment.

27:41.520 --> 27:46.548
- That's not possible.
- It concerns David Palmer's killer.

27:46.640 --> 27:47.629
All right.

27:47.720 --> 27:51.110
Palmer was assassinated
because he was on the verge of discovering

27:51.200 --> 27:55.398
the terrorists that attacked us today were
helped by someone in the administration.

27:55.480 --> 27:57.311
- Who?
- Walt Cummings.

27:58.680 --> 28:02.468
- Why would he be involved with terrorists?
- I couldn't tell you.

28:02.560 --> 28:05.677
But the terrorists are in possession
of a weaponised nerve gas

28:05.760 --> 28:09.753
and Walt Cummings may be the last chance
we have to stop them in time.

28:09.840 --> 28:13.389
Walt Cummings ordered
the assassination of David Palmer.

28:13.480 --> 28:17.439
I know that's hard to believe,
but I can prove it. It's true.

28:17.520 --> 28:20.353
Actually, it's not that hard to believe.

28:20.440 --> 28:24.353
The first lady also thinks
someone in the administration was involved.

28:24.440 --> 28:29.514
Your primary responsibility as lead agent is
to protect the president of the United States.

28:29.600 --> 28:32.353
Someone in his administration
is undermining him.

28:32.440 --> 28:34.590
That is equivalent to a coup d'état.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.993
Agent Pierce, please. Please.
I need your help.

28:57.680 --> 29:00.990
- Bauer's escaped.
- When? I didn't get a code alert.

29:01.080 --> 29:04.834
My comm's down. Call it in,
have agents cover the west gate.

29:04.920 --> 29:09.311
- What about you?
- I'll take your post. Go.

29:09.400 --> 29:11.391
Yes, sir.

29:16.520 --> 29:20.718
That was NSA. CTU hasn't transferred
the search operation to their jurisdiction.

29:20.800 --> 29:22.631
- What's the problem?
- I don't know.

29:22.720 --> 29:24.995
Call Lynn McGill, make sure we're in charge.

29:25.080 --> 29:30.279
He's going to ask why CTU's been pulled off
the search and I don't know what to tell him.

29:30.360 --> 29:34.114
You don't have to tell him anything.
You're the president.

29:34.200 --> 29:38.876
Agent Pierce, we're in the middle
of a meeting, if you don't mind.

29:38.960 --> 29:42.589
Mr President, my name is Jack Bauer.
I'm sorry to confront you like this.

29:42.680 --> 29:49.119
But your chief of staff is withholding
information vital to this nation's security.

29:50.280 --> 29:51.679
Stop this!

29:54.200 --> 29:57.317
I'm the president of the United States.
Get your hands off him.

29:57.400 --> 29:59.550
- Do something.
- I am, Mr President.

29:59.640 --> 30:01.915
I'm upholding my oath to protect you.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.436
That won't have any effect, sir.
I've overridden the distress line.

30:05.520 --> 30:08.239
Mr Cummings is guilty
of conspiring with terrorists.

30:08.320 --> 30:10.834
He facilitated the theft
of a military nerve gas

30:10.920 --> 30:14.674
and is responsible for the death
of three people, including David Palmer.

30:14.760 --> 30:19.515
- I know about that. There's an explanation.
- What do you mean, you know about that?

30:19.600 --> 30:23.434
Please. I just found out a couple of minutes
ago. It's very complicated.

30:23.520 --> 30:26.512
I don't know what he's told you,
but we need to find that gas,

30:26.600 --> 30:28.670
immediately, before it's too late.

30:28.760 --> 30:30.751
- It's already too late.
- What?

30:30.840 --> 30:34.230
Apparently,
it's on its way out of the country.

30:35.880 --> 30:38.075
- Where is it?
- He told me he doesn't know.

30:38.160 --> 30:42.153
- He's lying to you, sir.
- The man I had inside has gone dark.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.879
I don't know.

30:48.240 --> 30:50.231
I'm done talking with you, understand?

30:50.320 --> 30:53.437
You've read my file.
First, I'm gonna take out your right eye.

30:53.520 --> 30:55.829
Then your left. And then I'm gonna cut you.

30:55.920 --> 30:58.992
I'll keep cutting
until I get the information that I need.

30:59.080 --> 31:02.914
So, for the last time, where is the nerve gas?

31:03.000 --> 31:04.991
I don't know.

31:09.280 --> 31:11.919
Stop. Stop! Stop! I'll tell you.
I'll tell you.

31:12.920 --> 31:16.549
I'll tell you. It's on a freighter
leaving the port of Long Beach at 2:30.

31:16.640 --> 31:19.791
- How is it concealed?
- In a container of medical supplies.

31:19.880 --> 31:21.677
- Container number?
- I don't know.

31:21.760 --> 31:24.911
- What's the number?
- I don't know! I'd tell you, I swear.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.070
<i>Mr Bauer!</i>

31:27.160 --> 31:29.151
<i>I don't know.</i>

31:47.120 --> 31:50.032
<i>Mr Buchanan,
I've got Jack Bauer on line three.</i>

31:50.120 --> 31:51.917
Jack, what's going on?

31:52.000 --> 31:54.912
Bill, hold on.
I'm gonna put you on speakerphone.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.036
Bill, I'm here with the president.

31:57.120 --> 32:00.192
The gas is in Long Beach
in a container of medical supplies,

32:00.280 --> 32:04.273
on a freighter bound for central Asia.
It's set to depart at 2:30pm.

32:04.360 --> 32:07.193
- How solid is the intel?
- It's direct from Cummings.

32:07.280 --> 32:11.671
We've been trying to reach you about an order
we received changing our jurisdiction.

32:11.760 --> 32:12.909
Disregard the order.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.310
You want CTU to maintain
operational control of the retrieval?

32:16.400 --> 32:17.992
Yes. Absolutely.

32:18.080 --> 32:21.755
- I'm alerting CBP.
- Get hazmat teams to set up a perimeter.

32:21.840 --> 32:25.435
Have medical teams standing by
in case the gas is released.

32:25.520 --> 32:29.354
Good work, Jack.
Are you heading back to CTU?

32:29.440 --> 32:30.839
I don't know yet.

32:30.920 --> 32:33.480
We'll let you know
when we have more on the container.

32:33.560 --> 32:35.039
Copy that.

32:38.800 --> 32:41.792
Mr President, Agent Pierce and l

32:41.880 --> 32:46.670
are prepared to hand ourselves over
to the authorities now.

32:50.200 --> 32:52.270
Aaron.

32:52.360 --> 32:54.157
Yes, Mr President?

32:54.240 --> 32:58.870
Take back your shield
and get Walt Cummings out of my sight.

32:58.960 --> 33:00.951
Yes, sir.

33:19.640 --> 33:22.791
He told me it was too late,
and I believed him.

33:25.280 --> 33:28.795
You need to understand.
I trusted Walt Cummings.

33:28.880 --> 33:32.395
But he lied to me. I was coerced.

33:38.240 --> 33:42.552
There is one more thing
that we need to discuss.

33:42.640 --> 33:45.108
- What is that, sir?
- You.

33:45.200 --> 33:48.795
The fact that you're alive
presents problems for both of us.

33:50.360 --> 33:52.555
Yes, Mr President.

33:53.800 --> 33:57.031
I accomplished what I set out to do,

33:57.120 --> 34:01.238
which was to identify and locate
David Palmer's killer.

34:02.040 --> 34:06.477
I would like to stay on
until the nerve gas is retrieved,

34:06.560 --> 34:11.714
but after that I give you my word
I will simply disappear again.

34:13.199 --> 34:18.433
All right. I think that would be best,
for the good of the country.

34:19.880 --> 34:22.155
Yes, sir.

34:25.239 --> 34:27.514
Thank you, Mr Bauer.

34:27.600 --> 34:29.670
Thank you, Mr President.

34:31.239 --> 34:33.231
Excuse me.

35:11.360 --> 35:13.555
I'll see you soon.

35:26.520 --> 35:30.479
<i>- Hold on.
- What's happening?</i>

35:30.560 --> 35:31.879
- Marty.
- Charles.

35:31.960 --> 35:34.633
Come on, get out of the car. Come here.

35:35.360 --> 35:36.952
What?

35:39.720 --> 35:43.679
You were right. There was a conspiracy.
David was trying to warn you, and me.

35:43.760 --> 35:46.593
- I should have listened to you.
- l-l...

35:47.800 --> 35:50.155
You... You believe me now?

35:50.880 --> 35:52.711
It was Walt Cummings.

35:52.800 --> 35:55.553
He lied to me.
He convinced me you were out of control.

35:55.640 --> 35:56.709
- Walt?
- Yeah.

35:56.800 --> 36:01.271
Sending you back
to the clinic in Vermont was his idea.

36:03.880 --> 36:08.032
- And you went along with it.
- I'm sorry, Marty.

36:08.120 --> 36:12.910
Sending me away without a word.

36:13.000 --> 36:17.198
Like I was some nuisance to be gotten rid of.

36:22.000 --> 36:25.310
Excuse me. You wanted to know
when a link with CTU was established.

36:25.400 --> 36:27.391
Yes. Um...

36:27.480 --> 36:31.553
Thank you, Wendy. See that
the first lady's bags get back to her room.

36:31.640 --> 36:33.835
Of course.

36:37.720 --> 36:40.234
I've gotta go.

36:56.520 --> 36:58.715
Chloe, do we have
confirmation on the intel?

36:58.800 --> 37:01.997
There's only one ship scheduled
to leave Long Beach at 2:30.

37:02.080 --> 37:05.038
It's a freighter heading for Asia
leaving from pier F.

37:05.120 --> 37:07.395
We don't have any CTU teams in the vicinity,

37:07.480 --> 37:11.029
but we've got a Customs and Border
Protection task force onsite.

37:11.120 --> 37:14.749
Make sure they understand
the nerve gas is in 20 unmarked canisters

37:14.840 --> 37:16.910
in a shipment of medical supplies.

37:17.000 --> 37:21.949
They know that. But there's about a thousand
containers, and we don't know which one.

37:22.040 --> 37:24.315
Container 539-146, box 7.

37:24.400 --> 37:28.837
I hacked into the ship's manifest. It's the
only container stocking medical supplies.

37:28.920 --> 37:32.071
- Make sure the strike force units have that.
- Right.

37:32.160 --> 37:34.435
The White House is requesting a live feed.

37:34.520 --> 37:40.072
We'll have Chloe patch 'em in
once the tac teams reach the staging area.

37:42.960 --> 37:44.154
That's him.

37:44.240 --> 37:49.030
lvan Erwich, He's a
chemical engineer, trained at St Petersburg,

37:49.120 --> 37:51.634
Joined a separatist movement six years ago.

37:51.720 --> 37:54.359
Do you have any clearer images,
any file photos?

37:54.440 --> 37:58.353
No. Which is why we need you to lD him
when the strike force has a visual.

37:58.440 --> 38:01.637
OK. Just make sure that CBP knows
we need to take Erwich alive.

38:01.720 --> 38:03.199
They know. Stand by.

38:03.280 --> 38:06.431
- What's the situation?
- Strike team is in place, Mr President.

38:06.520 --> 38:09.717
We're just waiting
for the video feed to come up.

38:10.240 --> 38:12.231
Feed's up.

38:16.640 --> 38:20.519
CTU, we have located
the target container, No hostiles present,

38:20.600 --> 38:22.113
You have a green light.

38:22.200 --> 38:25.988
Remember, do not discharge your weapons
unless absolutely necessary,

38:26.080 --> 38:29.390
If a bullet breaches a canister,
we 'll have massive casualties,

38:29.480 --> 38:31.436
Copy that.

38:51.880 --> 38:53.632
Masks on.

38:54.920 --> 38:56.148
Go!

38:58.520 --> 38:59.669
Go, go, go,

39:03.880 --> 39:07.793
Don't move. Put your hands in the air now.

39:15.320 --> 39:17.436
He's dead. Open 'em up.

39:17.520 --> 39:20.432
Open 'em up. Open 'em all up.

39:20.520 --> 39:22.670
Moving on, moving on,

39:22.760 --> 39:25.274
Come on, get it open,

39:25.360 --> 39:28.511
Open it, come on, move it, Open it,

39:32.000 --> 39:34.514
Open it. Come on, come on.

39:34.600 --> 39:37.831
What have we got?
What have we got? Nothing?

39:38.840 --> 39:41.229
There are no gas canisters here, CTU.

39:41.320 --> 39:43.675
Repeat, the nerve gas is not here,

39:43.760 --> 39:47.070
- Get Walt Cummings in here now.
- Yes, sir.

39:49.200 --> 39:50.838
Dammit!

39:50.920 --> 39:53.309
The nerve gas isn't there.

39:53.400 --> 39:56.756
- It has to be.
- Where are the canisters?

39:56.840 --> 39:59.912
I don't know. I-I've told you everything.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.468
They have to be there.

40:04.840 --> 40:05.875
Oh, God.

40:05.960 --> 40:09.953
- What is it?
- That's Schaeffer, the man we had inside.

40:10.040 --> 40:14.795
They must have found out
we've reprogrammed the detonators.

40:36.320 --> 40:38.436
It's his cellphone, sir.

40:39.880 --> 40:43.111
- Who's calling you?
- That's Schaeffer's number.

40:43.200 --> 40:44.189
- Bill?
- Yeah?

40:44.280 --> 40:47.795
- I want you to monitor and record this call.
- We're on it.

40:47.880 --> 40:49.632
Answer it now.

40:51.880 --> 40:52.676
Yes?

40:52.760 --> 40:55.672
We know
you've altered the arming codes,

40:55.760 --> 40:58.320
- Who is this?
- I think you know my name.

40:58.400 --> 41:03.349
As I now know yours.
Your man Schaeffer confessed everything.

41:03.440 --> 41:05.829
Is President Logan with you?

41:06.800 --> 41:11.157
The president had nothing to do with this.
Nor did anyone else in the government.

41:11.240 --> 41:13.834
- I was acting alone.
- You expect me to believe that?

41:13.920 --> 41:18.789
It's the truth. Erwich, listen.
We can negotiate something.

41:18.880 --> 41:22.395
I don't negotiate with my enemies.
I eliminate them.

41:22.480 --> 41:26.792
Your country
is about to pay a very steep price.
