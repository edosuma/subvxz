WEBVTT

00:01.235 --> 00:02.670
-(hip-hop music playing)
-* Yeah *

00:03.704 --> 00:05.673
ANNOUNCER: Snowfall.

00:05.706 --> 00:08.109
All new Wednesdays at 10:00.

00:08.209 --> 00:09.210
(siren blares)

00:09.243 --> 00:10.444
On FX.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.547
(dance music)

00:13.581 --> 00:16.016
ANNOUNCER: FX presents Pose.

00:19.587 --> 00:22.056
PRAY TELL:
Where my boys at?
Where my boys at?

00:22.090 --> 00:24.425
Nice, nice.
The category is:

00:24.458 --> 00:26.094
Back to the Future.

00:26.127 --> 00:29.597
Bring it like it's 2015!

00:29.630 --> 00:33.101
Yeah, baby. I see you, Tin Man.

00:33.134 --> 00:35.269
Bring it.
It's like Reynolds Wrap

00:35.303 --> 00:36.904
realness, baby.

00:36.937 --> 00:38.572
(laughs)

00:38.606 --> 00:39.907
Radiation realness.

00:39.940 --> 00:42.410
Pop. Pop. Pop.
Pop, pop, pop.

00:42.443 --> 00:44.044
Oh!

00:44.078 --> 00:46.414
Judges, your scores.

00:46.447 --> 00:47.448
Who's next?

00:47.481 --> 00:49.717
-(whoosh)
-Ooh!

00:49.750 --> 00:51.385
(crowd cheering)

00:51.419 --> 00:54.555
She's giving me...
futuristic,

00:54.588 --> 00:58.226
freaky Farrakhan.

00:58.259 --> 01:00.128
Oh, yes.

01:00.161 --> 01:01.929
Uh-huh.

01:01.962 --> 01:04.064
Kwanzaa realness.

01:04.098 --> 01:06.066
Kwanzaalina.

01:06.100 --> 01:08.936
Judges, your scores.

01:08.969 --> 01:10.738
Ten, ten, ten, ten, ten.

01:10.771 --> 01:12.473
All right, the judges
like that one.

01:12.506 --> 01:14.742
(whoops) Lord.

01:14.775 --> 01:16.744
Lord have mercy.

01:16.777 --> 01:19.813
-No, no, no.
-(crowd booing)

01:19.847 --> 01:21.815
No. I said,
"Back to the Future,"

01:21.849 --> 01:25.353
not Sinbad
after Weight Watchers.

01:25.453 --> 01:27.521
Bitch, don't look at me
like that.

01:27.621 --> 01:28.789
Judges, your scores.

01:28.822 --> 01:30.491
Just as I suspected.

01:30.524 --> 01:32.193
Grand prize goes to

01:32.293 --> 01:34.428
-one-eyed Farrakhan, y'all.
-(crowd whoops, applauds)

01:34.462 --> 01:36.497
Come on, give 'em a hand.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.967
Beautiful work on that face.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.536
Mm, mm, mm.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.838
All right, y'all.

01:44.872 --> 01:49.042
All right, so listen.
I have a... I have a...

01:49.143 --> 01:51.612
Now, I have
a special announcement.

01:51.645 --> 01:55.716
My... my-my AIDS Cabaret
is about a week away.

01:55.816 --> 01:59.553
And my Blanca is walking around
with a bowl of tick-tickets.

01:59.653 --> 02:02.623
So y'all make sure
y'all buy yourselves one.

02:04.057 --> 02:06.026
All right. So...

02:06.059 --> 02:07.828
the...

02:09.029 --> 02:10.698
-(people gasping)
-Pray.

02:10.731 --> 02:13.234
(gasps)
Open your eyes, Pray.

02:13.334 --> 02:15.035
Somebody call an ambulance
or something.

02:15.068 --> 02:16.670
WOMAN:
Ambulance!

02:16.704 --> 02:19.340
-(sirens wail)
-BLANCA (sobbing): Come on.

02:19.373 --> 02:21.875
-WOMAN: Ambulance.
-(clunking)

02:21.909 --> 02:24.212
(faint radio chatter)

02:24.245 --> 02:26.247
(sirens whooping)

02:28.148 --> 02:30.083
(door opens)

02:30.184 --> 02:32.220
(footfalls approach)

02:32.253 --> 02:34.688
PRAY TELL:
The category is...

02:34.722 --> 02:38.091
Live...

02:38.192 --> 02:40.394
Work...

02:40.428 --> 02:44.164
Pose!

03:11.091 --> 03:13.093
(indistinct chatter)

03:14.094 --> 03:15.729
(device hissing)

03:15.763 --> 03:17.565
-Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
-NURSE JUDY: Goddamn it.

03:17.598 --> 03:19.367
-What? What is it?
-PRAY TELL: Take it off.

03:19.400 --> 03:22.069
I can't get a read on his blood
pressure without bruising him.

03:22.102 --> 03:24.104
I thought it was
the other machine, but...

03:24.137 --> 03:25.773
But? But what?

03:27.074 --> 03:28.709
-What's wrong with him?
-PRAY TELL: Yeah.

03:28.742 --> 03:31.044
-What's wrong with me?
-DR. BROOKS: We're still
waiting on

03:31.078 --> 03:33.547
blood tests to come back,
but based on this bruising

03:33.581 --> 03:35.316
and the fact
that you passed out,

03:35.416 --> 03:36.817
I'd say there's
something going on

03:36.917 --> 03:38.252
with your platelets.

03:38.286 --> 03:40.153
Have you been
more tired than usual?

03:40.254 --> 03:42.456
PRAY TELL:
Yeah. I just thought

03:42.490 --> 03:44.258
that was the old age kicking in.

03:44.292 --> 03:46.660
Where are these bruises from?

03:46.760 --> 03:48.829
I don't know. I think...

03:48.929 --> 03:50.398
just bumping into stuff,
I guess.

03:50.431 --> 03:53.634
They don't hurt, though.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.336
-How are your bowel movements?
-Not good.

03:55.436 --> 03:57.137
I haven't had a decent shit
since I started

03:57.170 --> 03:58.306
these medications.

04:00.007 --> 04:01.675
DR. BROOKS:
We'll schedule an endoscopy
to make sure

04:01.775 --> 04:03.477
there's no ulcerative
conditions.

04:03.511 --> 04:06.414
But all signs
are pointing to immune

04:06.447 --> 04:07.581
thrombocytopenic purpura.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.016
Thrombo-who? What?

04:09.116 --> 04:10.851
What is he talking about?

04:10.951 --> 04:12.520
You have low platelets
and internal bleeding.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.488
-(sighs)
-DR. BROOKS: If this were
a slower progression,

04:14.522 --> 04:16.590
I'd say it's HIV-related, but,

04:16.624 --> 04:18.826
um, something this fast
is most likely

04:18.859 --> 04:20.328
a reaction to the medication.

04:20.361 --> 04:22.296
We're gonna
have to take you off the AZT.

04:22.330 --> 04:25.799
I'll mix up some erythropoietin
for your I.V.

04:25.833 --> 04:28.168
to help raise
your red blood cells.

04:28.201 --> 04:31.004
But we're gonna
have to monitor you for a week.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.440
I'm so sorry, Pray.

04:33.441 --> 04:35.208
This is some bullshit.

04:35.309 --> 04:39.012
This is some bullshit,
this is some bullshit.

04:40.348 --> 04:42.350
-(Pray Tell sighs)
-Here.

04:42.383 --> 04:44.318
Don't want that.

04:44.352 --> 04:47.388
It works for some people,
not for everyone.

04:47.488 --> 04:50.223
And the good news
is that AZT toxicity

04:50.324 --> 04:52.292
is reversible in most cases.

04:54.227 --> 04:59.199
This virus is attacking
my cells 24 hours a day.

04:59.232 --> 05:02.169
Every day of the year.

05:02.202 --> 05:05.873
That is not... reversible!

05:07.908 --> 05:10.010
I want this shit out of me.

05:10.043 --> 05:13.180
I'm sick of it.

05:13.213 --> 05:16.817
I'm sick of not knowing
what it's doing to my insides.

05:16.850 --> 05:19.387
I'm-I'm sick...

05:19.420 --> 05:23.391
of not knowing...

05:23.424 --> 05:26.259
how fast or how slow
I'm gonna go.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.896
You got a lot of life
in you, Pray Tell,

05:28.929 --> 05:31.732
-and we love you.
-(Pray Tell inhales sharply)

05:31.765 --> 05:33.200
-(exhales slowly)
-NURSE JUDY: Honey, you're gonna

05:33.233 --> 05:34.935
feel so much better
in a few days.

05:35.035 --> 05:37.738
And I'm gonna be right here
by your bedside all week.

05:37.771 --> 05:40.774
Yeah, and you don't have to
worry about that AIDS Cabaret.

05:40.874 --> 05:43.411
Judy and I are gonna make sure
everything runs smoothly.

05:43.444 --> 05:46.447
You just got to sit there
in the audience and watch.

05:46.547 --> 05:48.382
And all that good music
is gonna remind you

05:48.416 --> 05:50.384
of how you got to stay alive.

05:50.418 --> 05:52.620
Don't treat me like a child.

05:54.622 --> 05:57.558
Please.

05:57.591 --> 06:00.694
Please, anything,
but don't do that.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.230
Yeah, I want to live.

06:03.263 --> 06:05.098
Y'all know I want to live.

06:05.132 --> 06:07.735
But I just need to throw
a motherfucking

06:07.768 --> 06:11.238
temper tantrum
every once in a while.

06:11.271 --> 06:14.442
Can I have that, at least?

06:15.443 --> 06:16.610
Just get the fuck out!

06:16.644 --> 06:19.413
Get out! (sighs)

06:19.447 --> 06:21.449
(Pray Tell sobbing softly)

06:23.884 --> 06:25.886
I'm sorry.

06:41.101 --> 06:43.637
(bell dings, door opens)

06:43.671 --> 06:46.173
-Oh, God.
-We both know you're
gonna be out of business

06:46.273 --> 06:49.643
eventually, but there's no need
to sabotage yourself.

06:49.677 --> 06:52.112
Uh, my community
supports each other.

06:52.145 --> 06:53.814
Don't get me wrong, I love gays.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.849
I'm sorry, are you talking about
your hairdresser

06:55.949 --> 06:57.951
or your personal stylist
at Bloomingdale's?

06:57.985 --> 06:59.687
It's the AIDS I don't like.

06:59.787 --> 07:01.822
Well, some of us can't just
pretend it ain't there.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.023
Oh.

07:03.123 --> 07:04.792
You think I haven't lost anyone?

07:04.825 --> 07:06.627
Fabrizio,

07:06.660 --> 07:09.262
my hairdresser
you so casually mentioned,

07:09.296 --> 07:11.364
my cousin Christopher.

07:11.465 --> 07:14.034
We used to make meatballs
at Grandma's house.

07:14.134 --> 07:16.770
Kept his pillow-biting secret
even after he died

07:16.804 --> 07:18.338
of "skin cancer."

07:18.371 --> 07:19.707
We all knew, though.

07:19.807 --> 07:22.710
It's why nobody came
to the funeral.

07:22.810 --> 07:25.679
Everyone has felt the pain
of this thing.

07:25.713 --> 07:27.615
That's why you, of all people,

07:27.648 --> 07:29.717
want to make sure
no one is thinking about it

07:29.817 --> 07:32.052
when they come through
that door, wondering if you've

07:32.152 --> 07:34.522
properly cleaned
your instruments before use.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.289
I got one of those sterilizing
machines in the back.

07:36.323 --> 07:38.692
-Do you want to see it?
-No.

07:38.726 --> 07:40.694
Actually, put your flyer
back in the window,

07:40.728 --> 07:42.796
anything to get you
out of here sooner.

07:44.865 --> 07:47.367
And just to prove
I don't have a heart of stone,

07:47.400 --> 07:51.004
here's 20 bucks
for your little AIDS night.

07:51.038 --> 07:53.406
Oh, wow.
20 actual whole dollars.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.377
You know what?

07:57.410 --> 07:59.212
I'm gonna come
and give a proper donation

07:59.246 --> 08:00.714
in person.

08:00.748 --> 08:02.883
Maybe I'll even
sing a song or two.

08:02.916 --> 08:05.519
I was quite the singer
at Rutgers.

08:05.553 --> 08:07.588
I could have had a career
on the stage,

08:07.688 --> 08:10.090
but I just can't stand
being told what to do,

08:10.190 --> 08:11.925
so acting wasn't for me.

08:12.025 --> 08:13.594
Oh...

08:15.495 --> 08:17.097
(bell dings)

08:21.769 --> 08:23.070
(man hacking, coughing)

08:23.103 --> 08:24.437
PRAY TELL:
Hey.

08:24.538 --> 08:26.106
Hello, roomie.

08:26.206 --> 08:29.276
-What's your name?
-Lewis Carter.

08:29.376 --> 08:31.344
Pneumonia.

08:32.379 --> 08:33.947
Pray Tell.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.949
Low platelets.

08:36.049 --> 08:39.587
I wish I could say
it was lovely to meet you.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.021
(grunts)

08:41.054 --> 08:42.756
-Hey, Lewis.
-(sighs)

08:42.790 --> 08:44.524
You two rest up.

08:44.558 --> 08:45.793
I'll be back with your meds.

08:45.893 --> 08:49.229
Hey. Hey, don't I know you?

08:49.262 --> 08:52.199
I don't believe so.

08:52.232 --> 08:54.902
I thought I knew all
the black queens in town.

08:54.935 --> 08:56.804
You ever go to the balls?

08:56.904 --> 08:59.607
God, no.

08:59.640 --> 09:02.409
Perhaps you've seen me
at B. Altman.

09:02.442 --> 09:04.144
I used to work there.

09:04.244 --> 09:05.946
Oh.

09:05.979 --> 09:08.448
She a posh queen.

09:09.983 --> 09:13.153
I am a college-educated man.

09:13.253 --> 09:15.923
I am not a queen.

09:21.428 --> 09:23.430
(faint chatter on television)

09:28.836 --> 09:30.804
(laughter on television)

09:30.838 --> 09:33.741
(Lewis coughing)

09:38.578 --> 09:40.748
(coughing continues)

09:40.781 --> 09:42.816
You okay?

09:42.850 --> 09:45.352
-(coughing)
-(thudding, items clattering)

09:45.452 --> 09:47.154
You want me to buzz the nurse?

09:47.187 --> 09:49.690
(pained, hacking coughs)

09:49.790 --> 09:51.324
(Lewis groaning, coughing)

09:51.358 --> 09:53.661
-Nurse! Nurse!
-(monitor beeping)

09:53.694 --> 09:55.796
I know what you're doing!
It's the drugs!

09:55.829 --> 09:57.798
-Something's wrong.
-He's having a heart attack.

09:57.831 --> 09:59.633
You're hurting him.
What poison did you give him?

09:59.667 --> 10:01.635
Pray Tell, I need you
to get back in your bed.

10:01.669 --> 10:03.336
-You gave him poison!
-Pray.

10:03.370 --> 10:04.471
-Calm down.
-It's the drugs.

10:04.504 --> 10:07.340
(yells)

10:07.374 --> 10:09.810
(gasps)
Oh, my God.

10:09.843 --> 10:11.979
(panting)

10:12.012 --> 10:15.382
(muffled groaning)

10:15.482 --> 10:18.351
-(groaning stops)
-(sustained beep)

10:21.288 --> 10:23.223
(beep distorts)

10:23.323 --> 10:25.525
(thunder crashes, rumbles)

10:25.558 --> 10:27.627
(monitor beeping steadily)

10:27.661 --> 10:29.663
(machines hissing, pumping)

10:38.906 --> 10:41.041
(grunts)

10:41.074 --> 10:43.043
CANDY:
My dearest Pray Tell,
please die soon

10:43.076 --> 10:45.478
so I can have some goddamn
company here in hell.

10:45.512 --> 10:47.414
You know you miss me.
Love, Candy.

10:54.387 --> 10:55.889
CANDY:
Die, bitch.

10:55.923 --> 10:58.358
-XOXO, Candy.
-(lighter flicks)

10:59.392 --> 11:01.394
(cigarette sizzles)

11:05.198 --> 11:07.434
Hello, Pray Tell.

11:08.702 --> 11:10.670
I've come to give you
good news, bitch.

11:10.704 --> 11:12.706
(thunder rumbles)

11:20.513 --> 11:21.749
CANDY: Ooh, he left
the good shit here.

11:21.782 --> 11:23.050
-Ooh.
-(pills rattling)

11:23.083 --> 11:25.085
These Valium make you feel like

11:25.118 --> 11:27.755
you're taking
a warm bath inside. Mm.

11:27.788 --> 11:28.789
Are you a ghost?

11:28.889 --> 11:30.123
Or am I dead, too?

11:30.223 --> 11:31.591
(Candy chuckles)

11:33.193 --> 11:36.296
Ooh. Stunning, bitch.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.966
-I got this new girl
doing my makeup.
-(thunder rumbles)

11:39.066 --> 11:41.769
She used to work at the Lancôme
counter at Bloomingdale's,

11:41.802 --> 11:44.738
before her boyfriend killed her.

11:44.772 --> 11:46.740
PRAY TELL:
So I'm dreaming?

11:46.774 --> 11:48.942
It's all a dream, baby.

11:48.976 --> 11:51.411
That's the first thing
you learn.

11:51.444 --> 11:54.714
Me? I'm having the time
of my life.

11:54.748 --> 11:57.751
I'm doing a photo shoot later
with Robert Mapplethorpe.

11:57.785 --> 12:00.287
Then I got lunch with Lee.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.555
That's Liberace, bitch.

12:02.589 --> 12:04.724
Am I'm taking private
dance lessons from

12:04.758 --> 12:06.894
the one and only Alvin Ailey.

12:06.927 --> 12:10.463
So you're spending eternity
with people who died from AIDS?

12:11.498 --> 12:13.066
That's my Heaven.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.634
You make your own.

12:14.667 --> 12:17.104
I prefer to be around people
who understand me.

12:18.471 --> 12:20.007
-You'll see.
-No, I won't.

12:20.107 --> 12:21.408
Not anytime soon.

12:21.441 --> 12:22.442
I'm gonna fight.

12:22.475 --> 12:23.944
For what?

12:23.977 --> 12:26.413
To go to another ball?

12:26.446 --> 12:29.516
To have another drink at a sad,
lonely bar where the crowd

12:29.616 --> 12:31.852
just gets smaller and smaller
every night?

12:33.854 --> 12:36.256
You want to be
the last one standing?

12:36.289 --> 12:38.158
After you done said goodbye
to every last one

12:38.191 --> 12:40.160
-of your friends?
-I'm alive.

12:40.193 --> 12:43.530
There's always joy mixed in
with all of that pain.

12:43.630 --> 12:45.698
You don't know pain, Pray Tell.

12:45.799 --> 12:48.101
You may have held the hand
of your lovers

12:48.135 --> 12:52.305
while they shit themselves
and drowned in their own bile,

12:52.339 --> 12:54.274
but when it's you in that bed

12:54.307 --> 12:56.476
and you got Saint Blanca
holding your hand

12:56.509 --> 12:59.379
and looking down at you
with all her bullshit,

12:59.479 --> 13:02.115
you're gonna wish you would've
given up gracefully sooner.

13:02.149 --> 13:04.451
Wait.

13:04.484 --> 13:05.953
What did you mean when you said

13:05.986 --> 13:08.655
that those people
understand you?

13:10.223 --> 13:13.827
Candy, did you have AIDS?

13:15.863 --> 13:18.698
(sighs)
I never told nobody.

13:18.731 --> 13:20.200
I was always careful.

13:20.233 --> 13:21.869
With all my tricks.

13:21.902 --> 13:25.205
Condoms every time,
no exceptions.

13:25.238 --> 13:28.508
I'm not trying to hurt nobody.
(sighs)

13:28.541 --> 13:31.378
But people treat you different
when you they know you're sick.

13:31.411 --> 13:32.545
(thunder rumbles)

13:32.579 --> 13:36.049
-But...
-(pills rattling)

13:36.083 --> 13:38.685
-I'm your Angel of Mercy.
-(thunder crashes)

13:38.718 --> 13:41.188
Take these.
It won't hurt.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.223
I promise.

13:43.256 --> 13:46.226
You'll just float on away.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.395
Next thing you know,

13:48.428 --> 13:51.531
you're in a bike ride
along the river...

13:51.564 --> 13:53.033
with Perry Ellis

13:53.066 --> 13:54.868
and Steve Rubell.

13:57.070 --> 13:59.072
(thunder cracks)

14:03.443 --> 14:06.413
(whispers):
I'm afraid.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.415
Everyone is.

14:09.616 --> 14:11.251
Here.

14:15.956 --> 14:17.590
Trust me.

14:23.763 --> 14:25.532
-I don't want to.
-(thunder cracks)

14:26.633 --> 14:30.103
-(alarms blaring)
-Hello?

14:30.137 --> 14:32.139
(alarms continue)

14:35.642 --> 14:37.444
Hello?

14:38.478 --> 14:41.248
(indistinct voice on radio)

14:42.916 --> 14:44.451
-Hey.
-We lost power.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.419
-What happened?
-Let's get you back into bed.

14:46.453 --> 14:50.223
-Come on. Come on.
-Gracias.

14:50.257 --> 14:51.758
(thunder crashes)

14:51.791 --> 14:54.761
(thunder rumbling)

14:54.794 --> 14:57.797
(man humming spiritual)

15:06.439 --> 15:08.641
(humming continues)

15:15.615 --> 15:17.817
Why are you singing?

15:17.850 --> 15:21.621
-I'm singing for you, son.
-Don't call me son.

15:21.654 --> 15:23.290
I'm not your son.

15:23.323 --> 15:26.693
That song used to relax you.

15:26.793 --> 15:28.361
Yeah.
And then what would you do

15:28.461 --> 15:30.363
after I was good and relaxed?

15:30.463 --> 15:32.865
You've got to forgive me, son.

15:32.966 --> 15:34.801
Or else you're gonna be
carrying me

15:34.834 --> 15:36.869
until the end of time.

15:36.970 --> 15:39.039
You don't deserve
my forgiveness.

15:42.042 --> 15:44.111
But I got to give it anyway.

15:46.113 --> 15:48.381
For me.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.017
Not for you.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.852
I don't remember
what I did so wrong.

15:52.885 --> 15:56.556
What you did was refuse
to tell the truth.

15:56.656 --> 15:59.859
That you found my mother
so desperate for a man

15:59.892 --> 16:02.996
after my father died,
and convinced her to marry you.

16:03.030 --> 16:05.365
You seduced me!

16:05.398 --> 16:07.634
I was 12 years old
when you started

16:07.667 --> 16:10.870
playing footsies with me
under the table!

16:10.903 --> 16:16.076
You slithered into my bed
under the cloak of night.

16:17.177 --> 16:19.246
You said you loved me.

16:24.417 --> 16:26.086
(sighs)

16:26.186 --> 16:30.557
Why do we always fight
when we see each other?

16:30.590 --> 16:33.660
The only time we didn't fight
was at my funeral.

16:34.694 --> 16:37.097
You didn't say a word.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.699
It was so peaceful.

16:39.732 --> 16:43.370
I forgive you.
I forgive you. I forgive you.

16:43.403 --> 16:46.373
I forgive you! I forgive you!

16:46.406 --> 16:48.541
-COSTAS: Pray.
-(thunder rumbling)

16:48.575 --> 16:50.910
(rain falling)

16:54.181 --> 16:57.384
Shh. Baby.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.186
You got to get dressed.

17:02.689 --> 17:05.225
-Costas?
-Come on.

17:05.258 --> 17:07.727
I am not letting you dance off
with those negative Nancies.

17:07.760 --> 17:10.763
It is not your time.
Not tonight.

17:10.797 --> 17:13.066
Come on.

17:13.100 --> 17:16.069
Where... where are we going?

17:16.103 --> 17:18.605
To the AIDS Cabaret.

17:18.638 --> 17:20.373
Hundreds of men have died
in this hospital,

17:20.407 --> 17:22.975
and they are waiting.

17:23.076 --> 17:24.644
They need a show.
Come on.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.582
Are you gonna be there?

17:31.951 --> 17:35.822
Of course.
I'm here for you.

17:35.922 --> 17:37.990
I'm here for you always.

18:10.457 --> 18:14.194
* The night is bitter *

18:14.294 --> 18:17.029
* The stars have lost
their glitter *

18:18.598 --> 18:23.670
* The winds grow colder *

18:23.703 --> 18:27.640
* And suddenly you're older *

18:29.041 --> 18:31.544
* And all because *

18:31.644 --> 18:34.714
* Of the man *

18:34.814 --> 18:39.852
* That got away *

18:39.886 --> 18:41.288
(light clunks)

18:43.823 --> 18:46.826
* No more *

18:46.859 --> 18:50.029
* His eager call *

18:50.062 --> 18:54.867
* The writing's on the wall *

18:54.901 --> 18:59.005
* The dreams you've dreamed *

18:59.038 --> 19:01.874
* Have all *

19:01.908 --> 19:06.646
-* Gone astray... *
-(saxophone playing)

19:09.148 --> 19:12.419
* The man that won you *

19:12.519 --> 19:16.523
* Has run off and undone you *

19:16.556 --> 19:19.892
* That great beginning *

19:19.926 --> 19:23.696
* Has seen the final inning *

19:23.730 --> 19:26.833
* Don't know what happened *

19:26.866 --> 19:29.836
* It's all a crazy *

19:29.869 --> 19:35.041
* Game *

19:36.676 --> 19:38.211
* No more *

19:38.245 --> 19:42.114
* That all-time thrill *

19:42.215 --> 19:45.285
* For you've *

19:45.385 --> 19:50.189
* Been through the mill *

19:50.223 --> 19:55.562
* And ne-ne-never a new love *

19:55.595 --> 19:59.198
* Will be the same *

20:01.368 --> 20:02.735
* Tuh! *

20:02.769 --> 20:04.937
* Good riddance *

20:04.971 --> 20:09.442
* Goodbye *

20:09.476 --> 20:12.211
* Every trick of his *

20:12.245 --> 20:17.650
* You're onto *

20:17.750 --> 20:19.786
* But fools *

20:19.819 --> 20:22.255
* Will be fools *

20:22.289 --> 20:24.824
* And where's *

20:24.924 --> 20:28.561
* He gone *

20:28.595 --> 20:31.998
* To *

20:32.098 --> 20:35.668
* The road gets rougher *

20:35.768 --> 20:38.338
* It's lonelier and tougher *

20:38.438 --> 20:41.941
* With hope you burn up *

20:41.974 --> 20:46.513
* Tomorrow he will turn up *

20:46.613 --> 20:49.949
* There's just no letup *

20:49.982 --> 20:52.352
* The live long night *

20:52.452 --> 20:57.790
* And day... *

20:59.326 --> 21:02.194
* Ever since this world *

21:02.295 --> 21:05.332
* Began *

21:05.365 --> 21:08.167
* There is nothing *

21:08.200 --> 21:13.272
* Sadder than... *

21:18.210 --> 21:22.181
* A one-man man *

21:22.214 --> 21:24.551
* Looking for the man *

21:24.651 --> 21:27.019
* That got *

21:28.788 --> 21:32.559
* Away *

21:36.228 --> 21:39.699
* The man *

21:39.732 --> 21:42.669
* That got *

21:44.837 --> 21:50.076
* Away *

21:51.711 --> 21:56.182
-(saxophone plays flourish)
-* Ooh. *

21:56.215 --> 21:58.351
-(applause)
-Thank you.
