00:13.186 --> 00:14.755
Last
Voices echoed in my mind

00:14.756 --> 00:16.846
when I took my son

00:16.870 --> 00:18.960
to my old school.

00:19.126 --> 00:20.459
Did revive him

00:20.460 --> 00:22.663
one magical time of my life.

00:22.664 --> 00:24.164
Back to the time

00:24.398 --> 00:26.067
where my life was full of

00:26.068 --> 00:27.500
innocence of youth.

00:27.501 --> 00:29.070
My childhood dream

00:29.071 --> 00:30.102
was to be a great

00:30.103 --> 00:32.139
basketball player,
as well as my father.

00:32.140 --> 00:34.573
He was my hero, my companion
,

00:34.574 --> 00:38.010
the best friend that a
child could have.

00:38.011 --> 00:39.745
But he was more here.

00:39.746 --> 00:42.064
His death was a hard reminder

00:42.065 --> 00:44.450
That life is a fleeting shadow
,

00:44.451 --> 00:46.587
every moment is a precious gift

00:46.588 --> 00:48.689
to be shared with anyone.

00:48.690 --> 00:51.523
Wanted to express my son

00:51.558 --> 00:53.294
feelings and
fondest memories

00:53.295 --> 00:55.094
a wonderful childhood.

00:55.095 --> 00:58.165
For, somehow inspire you
to see through my eyes,

00:58.166 --> 00:59.699
and help you understand

00:59.700 --> 01:01.335
that via the pull
patience and persistence,

01:01.336 --> 01:03.169
dreams are possible.

01:03.170 --> 01:05.306
This was the legacy left by my father

01:05.307 --> 01:08.139
for over thirty years.

01:30.230 --> 01:34.997
CLENSOM, CAROLINA SOUTH
, 1959

01:38.271 --> 01:47.043
PISTOL A LEGEND IS BORN

04:35.148 --> 04:37.383
I remember like it was yesterday
.

04:37.384 --> 04:40.386
Was the beginning of an incredible journey
.

04:40.387 --> 04:43.657
The year that would change my life forever...

04:43.658 --> 04:47.028
and define the course
my destination.

04:47.594 --> 04:49.528
1958 was a period innocent,

04:49.529 --> 04:51.530
of hope and change in America.

04:51.531 --> 04:55.501
A time when
thought that everything would be possible.

04:55.502 --> 04:58.470
At least, that's how
in their Maravich.

04:58.471 --> 05:01.608
I like that! A young
with confidence.

05:01.609 --> 05:03.442
We made an election at school.

05:03.443 --> 05:04.376
Who won?

05:04.377 --> 05:07.369
Nixon. I voted for JFK.

05:07.647 --> 05:09.514
Like his father,

05:09.549 --> 05:11.183
Always voting on the weaker.

05:11.184 --> 05:13.986
Weaker?
With Jack Kennedy

05:13.987 --> 05:16.390
we build houses on the moon in 1970

05:16.391 --> 05:17.656
and you know why?

05:17.657 --> 05:19.994
Because he has confidence. -Confidence.

05:19.995 --> 05:22.094
Let Pete coffee, Press.

05:22.095 --> 05:24.164
Many things will change in the next decade.

05:24.165 --> 05:26.131
Dad was an optimist and a genius

05:26.132 --> 05:28.569
to create ways of stimulating my confidence.

05:28.570 --> 05:31.870
I was watching Gene Autry other day

05:31.871 --> 05:33.138
and suddenly realized

05:33.139 --> 05:35.109
a good basketball player

05:35.110 --> 05:37.142
can get along just fine

05:37.143 --> 05:40.612
if so fast
as a gunman.

05:40.613 --> 05:41.914
I'll show you.

05:41.915 --> 05:44.184
Give me the ball.
Get up Peter.

05:44.185 --> 05:46.420
I will teach an exercise.

05:46.421 --> 05:47.410
Turn around.

05:47.654 --> 05:49.223
Lower your arms.

05:49.224 --> 05:50.213
This.

05:50.390 --> 05:52.559
Now, do not pay attention to me
.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.126
I want to focus.

05:54.127 --> 05:56.028
Now estufe the chest!

05:56.029 --> 05:57.160
Not want to think

05:57.161 --> 05:58.901
which is a weakling.

06:00.133 --> 06:02.223
This shoulders in place.

06:02.936 --> 06:06.394
Now when I
drop this ball.

06:07.307 --> 06:08.509
Want beat palms in front

06:08.510 --> 06:11.460
and take the ball
behind you.

06:12.078 --> 06:14.313
But need to focus.

06:14.314 --> 06:16.081
Hear my voice.

06:16.082 --> 06:17.116
Do not listen to me.

06:17.117 --> 06:18.547
Do not listen to me.

06:19.619 --> 06:21.329
This is impossible.

06:22.022 --> 06:23.046
Impossible?

06:23.123 --> 06:26.425
We will see their hands
gunman, ok?

06:26.426 --> 06:27.686
Okay, Helen.

06:30.630 --> 06:34.730
Well, do not pay attention to me
, Press.

06:39.172 --> 06:41.340
You "found" that
could do.

06:41.341 --> 06:46.142
I "knew" that I would
. Trust!

06:58.058 --> 07:00.025
But Dad's inspiration

07:00.026 --> 07:02.094
not change the fact that in school

07:02.095 --> 07:04.295
I was a misfit,

07:04.330 --> 07:07.599
a lonely boy with big dreams.

07:07.600 --> 07:09.301
But this country was not founded

07:09.302 --> 07:11.367
by ordinary people who dared to believe

07:11.368 --> 07:14.039
That big dreams come true?

07:14.040 --> 07:15.641
That's what I was taught.

07:15.642 --> 07:18.912
With liberty and justice for all.

07:23.616 --> 07:27.985
Okay.
Today we talk about dreams.

07:28.455 --> 07:31.957
More specifically,
the American dream.

07:31.958 --> 07:35.293
The American Dream is a concept

07:35.328 --> 07:38.868
and a belief that anything is possible.

07:38.998 --> 07:41.660
What dreams do you have today?

07:42.669 --> 07:45.139
Who would you like to be?

07:46.005 --> 07:47.072
I want to write

07:47.073 --> 07:50.008
in 200 words
By the end of class,

07:50.009 --> 07:53.449
what are your dreams for the future.

07:54.047 --> 07:55.377
Any questions?

07:56.916 --> 07:59.151
Okay, can begin.

07:59.152 --> 08:02.289
How could put
a dream into words?

08:02.290 --> 08:04.556
Something went
in my heart?

08:04.557 --> 08:06.326
When I was in eighth grade,

08:06.327 --> 08:08.360
all we wanted was to be a great

08:08.361 --> 08:11.330
basketball player,
as my father.

08:11.331 --> 08:14.134
But with 1.60
tall and 40 pounds,

08:14.135 --> 08:15.675
who would believe?

08:16.236 --> 08:20.372
I think only my father and I
believed at first.

08:20.373 --> 08:22.407
When I was not on the court,

08:22.408 --> 08:25.412
everything you thought was that there was another boy

08:25.413 --> 08:27.903
practicing more than me.

08:28.515 --> 08:30.284
And he could
scholarship

08:30.285 --> 08:32.317
should be mine,

08:32.318 --> 08:35.168
If I do not try harder.

08:37.624 --> 08:38.744
Yes, Peter?

08:38.857 --> 08:40.256
I need...

09:26.973 --> 09:30.442
Boy, you do not
should be in class?

09:30.443 --> 09:31.633
Yes, sir.

09:32.245 --> 09:34.663
I hope you today at 15:30,

09:34.664 --> 09:37.414
to deal with the problem.

09:39.419 --> 09:40.988
I figured when Dad knew

09:40.989 --> 09:42.954
I killed lesson

09:42.989 --> 09:45.324
he would give me his famous spanking,

09:45.325 --> 09:49.595
or let me grounded
for life.

09:50.029 --> 09:52.964
No, no, no! Wait!

09:56.536 --> 09:59.706
You need to take the guy
until the barrier.

09:59.707 --> 10:02.909
Exit barrier. Stuck!

10:02.944 --> 10:08.142
Skin with skin.

10:10.283 --> 10:11.683
Understand? Yes, sir.

10:11.684 --> 10:14.604
Okay, let
again.

10:17.090 --> 10:17.988
!

10:23.363 --> 10:24.933
Everyone here!

10:25.265 --> 10:27.601
Dad was an official
retired navy,

10:27.602 --> 10:29.503
a hero of World War II

10:29.504 --> 10:31.336
is a very serious man,

10:31.337 --> 10:33.006
when he came to inspire and train students

10:33.007 --> 10:34.787
Clemson College.

10:35.074 --> 10:36.910
According to Dad, the way to play

10:36.911 --> 10:39.011
basketball reflected how

10:39.012 --> 10:41.113
that person would live his life.

10:41.114 --> 10:43.749
His teams knew well your opinion.

10:43.750 --> 10:46.710
When he spoke, everyone listened
.

10:46.719 --> 10:49.656
I'm not spending precious moments

10:49.657 --> 10:51.723
of my life
to teach them

10:51.724 --> 10:53.627
To throw a ball in a basket
.

10:53.628 --> 10:57.414
This here is a
lifestyle.

10:57.449 --> 11:00.243
I want the players to think,

11:00.244 --> 11:02.241
work, to sweat, have challenges

11:02.242 --> 11:04.204
and discipline because the other things

11:04.205 --> 11:10.131
has no value.

11:12.645 --> 11:14.514
The problem with you guys,

11:14.515 --> 11:16.445
is that they are a bunch of goons
,

11:16.446 --> 11:18.846
who think they know everything.

11:22.121 --> 11:23.581
Give me the ball.

11:31.431 --> 11:33.661
You see this ball?

11:34.567 --> 11:36.101
Size of this sphere

11:36.102 --> 11:39.892
represents everything
know about basketball,

11:41.941 --> 11:44.042
but the size of this ball is

11:44.043 --> 11:48.693
everything that has not been discovered
about the game.

11:53.720 --> 11:57.986
This point is all
you know. Together!

12:04.597 --> 12:06.498
If forget the girls
and the cars,

12:06.499 --> 12:09.269
and hear me, will get things never

12:09.270 --> 12:11.169
thought possible.

12:11.170 --> 12:12.739
Do not care if you
is low, slow,

12:12.740 --> 12:14.172
thin or high.

12:14.207 --> 12:15.874
Can play with the best.

12:15.875 --> 12:19.244
<i>engaging maximum
you to perfect</i>

12:19.245 --> 12:20.714
Now we train these
played again, folks.

12:20.715 --> 12:22.565
Let's do it right.

12:28.187 --> 12:29.211
!

12:34.460 --> 12:36.960
That's it! That's what I!

12:37.330 --> 12:39.232
That afternoon I had to face

12:39.233 --> 12:40.863
the wrath of Vern Pendleton,

12:40.864 --> 12:42.954
The high school coach.

12:43.002 --> 12:44.671
You is small for a Maravich.

12:44.672 --> 12:46.571
His mother feeds you well?

12:46.572 --> 12:47.762
Yes, sir.

12:48.641 --> 12:50.404
Has pedigree.

12:50.943 --> 12:52.829
I think you will not be

12:52.830 --> 12:54.646
a star football,

12:54.647 --> 12:56.681
but might play basketball.

12:56.682 --> 12:58.322
Do not use moccasin.

12:59.252 --> 13:02.453
What? Well, you know

13:02.488 --> 13:05.425
my assistant, Carl
Cannfield the cafeteria?

13:05.426 --> 13:06.289
I know.

13:06.592 --> 13:09.394
It delivers the equipment in the locker room.

13:09.395 --> 13:11.375
Your closet is 41.

13:11.397 --> 13:13.365
Let's start in 2 minutes.

13:13.366 --> 13:14.230
How?

13:14.667 --> 13:15.933
Want to train

13:15.968 --> 13:17.137
With the team principal, do not you?

13:17.138 --> 13:18.002
I want.

13:18.037 --> 13:20.438
Go get dressed, then.

13:20.473 --> 13:22.075
If you are waiting for me
it late.

13:22.076 --> 13:23.266
Come on, come on!

13:23.943 --> 13:25.444
It was my big chance!

13:25.445 --> 13:27.312
Training with the first team!

13:27.313 --> 13:29.114
But my big chance

13:29.115 --> 13:31.483
was also the beginning of
major problems.

13:31.484 --> 13:33.063
Different people do not always

13:33.064 --> 13:34.653
are received from
open arms.

13:34.654 --> 13:38.291
On the first day of training
I do not I integrated.

13:38.292 --> 13:40.225
Not got the right equipment.

13:40.226 --> 13:42.854
Carl! Carl!

13:45.965 --> 13:47.532
Whatever here?

13:47.533 --> 13:49.793
I will train with the team.

13:56.709 --> 13:58.944
So hurry up, let's start
already.

13:58.945 --> 14:02.073
The protector is very large.

14:02.248 --> 14:04.249
It is very big!
I need a minor.

14:04.250 --> 14:05.148
How?

14:14.360 --> 14:15.452
Lions!

14:15.895 --> 14:18.096
Oh, you need
less chill!

14:18.097 --> 14:20.965
Come on!

14:21.000 --> 14:22.067
30 free throws.

14:22.068 --> 14:24.918
The training begins within 5 minutes.

14:30.276 --> 14:32.277
He is the son of
Maravich coach?

14:32.278 --> 14:34.180
Is. I do not know what the
my father has in mind

14:34.181 --> 14:35.415
to let him train.

14:35.416 --> 14:37.016
It is hard.

14:37.149 --> 14:38.683
Have you seen this guy
in the hallways?

14:38.684 --> 14:41.186
Always walking with a
basketball.

14:41.187 --> 14:43.121
It is a strange boy
, Sandy.

14:43.122 --> 14:45.942
He deserves credit for trying,

14:46.058 --> 14:47.528
Courageous boy.

14:57.537 --> 14:58.663
Come on!

15:00.206 --> 15:02.073
The record of wins and losses

15:02.074 --> 15:04.075
was all that mattered to the technician.

15:04.076 --> 15:06.378
While the Lions continue winning,

15:06.379 --> 15:09.114
he would never put me
in the game.

15:09.115 --> 15:10.916
I realized that the chances of occupying

15:10.917 --> 15:14.219
the place of a holder
practically non-existent.

15:14.220 --> 15:15.855
And if it were up to Buddy,

15:15.856 --> 15:17.422
the son of
Technical Pendleton,

15:17.423 --> 15:20.863
I never put the Peach the court.

15:22.461 --> 15:24.230
Buddy Pendleton comes down with the ball,

15:24.231 --> 15:27.465
sewing,

15:27.500 --> 15:30.350
Rises to the pan, and scores!

15:32.505 --> 15:34.972
It was not convinced.

15:35.007 --> 15:36.508
It was the confidence that told me

15:36.509 --> 15:38.378
I could play better than others.

15:38.379 --> 15:40.264
Trust that had to do

15:40.265 --> 15:42.080
my father exercises

15:42.081 --> 15:45.383
for more than 10,000 hours,
since I was 5 years old.

15:45.384 --> 15:48.053
Dad helped me develop the discipline
,

15:48.054 --> 15:51.089
dedication and the desire
that led me to believe

15:51.090 --> 15:53.592
that could take the place of any
a team,

15:53.593 --> 15:56.343
even Buddy Pendleton .

15:56.495 --> 15:58.293
If not for Carl Cannfield
,

15:58.294 --> 16:00.532
I'd be totally bored.

16:00.533 --> 16:03.268
While others
celebrated the victories

16:03.269 --> 16:06.796
got tired of sitting,

16:07.940 --> 16:09.342
wondering when would chance

16:09.343 --> 16:11.743
to participate in a game.

16:17.516 --> 16:19.986
Hey, champ,
passes the pliers.

16:19.987 --> 16:21.797
It's there in the box.

16:23.189 --> 16:24.069
Thank you.

16:27.059 --> 16:31.463
Looking from up the basket seems
that can hit any pitch.

16:31.464 --> 16:33.624
I wanted to have this time!

16:34.567 --> 16:35.687
No kidding!

16:37.470 --> 16:39.873
You know, one time a guy told me

16:39.874 --> 16:42.207
I had a screw loose

16:42.208 --> 16:45.510
when I said I wanted to be professional
.

16:45.511 --> 16:46.478
Really?

16:47.346 --> 16:51.180
Yeah, he did not even want
watch me play.

16:52.385 --> 16:54.125
Play the ball here.

16:56.989 --> 16:59.157
When you are down there

16:59.158 --> 17:00.725
everything seems difficult.

17:00.726 --> 17:04.162
It's like fighting
windmills.

17:04.163 --> 17:06.143
Give me another ball.

17:08.034 --> 17:11.924
The guy who believes
it, only see limits,

17:12.938 --> 17:16.141
but a dreamer's the kind of people

17:16.142 --> 17:21.212
believes that these two
balls can fit in the basket.

17:23.983 --> 17:29.319
When you dream, everything is possible
. It's late.

17:30.456 --> 17:32.058
How about playing face to face?

17:32.059 --> 17:33.252
I start.

17:34.026 --> 17:34.958
Right.

17:42.902 --> 17:44.037
When I was in eighth grade,

17:44.038 --> 17:46.170
was on the bench,

17:46.205 --> 17:48.745
as you were today.

17:54.080 --> 17:56.410
I know what's going on.

17:56.549 --> 17:57.684
The hands sweat, the heart races

17:57.685 --> 17:59.982
like a freight train.

18:02.154 --> 18:04.322
Finally, you
comes into play.

18:04.323 --> 18:07.225
Fans who are there, not
know what they are feeling.

18:07.226 --> 18:09.395
They just expect there on the court,
somehow that boy

18:09.396 --> 18:13.264
help the team they love
to win the game.

18:13.265 --> 18:15.133
When we think so,

18:15.134 --> 18:18.037
a dream no more than
is a challenge

18:18.038 --> 18:20.578
we put ourselves.

18:20.639 --> 18:21.833
Your turn.

18:27.046 --> 18:28.314
Do you understand what I'm saying, Pete?

18:28.315 --> 18:29.505
Yes, sir.

18:30.082 --> 18:32.034
It's after 10,
Press Maravich,

18:32.035 --> 18:33.953
neighbors just called.

18:33.954 --> 18:34.586
Really?

18:34.587 --> 18:36.521
Well, they are
agreed so late?

18:36.522 --> 18:37.682
Cute.

18:37.890 --> 18:39.225
How long this will take?

18:39.226 --> 18:40.458
Until I win.

18:40.459 --> 18:41.693
Really? Go dreaming.

18:41.694 --> 18:42.894
Best of seven.

18:42.895 --> 18:45.544
Stay here, honey!
I need fans.

18:45.545 --> 18:48.535
Need a beating
, yes.

18:49.335 --> 18:51.705
When will grow, Press?

18:52.138 --> 18:53.938
Once you grow as well.

18:53.939 --> 18:55.819
Point! End of game.

18:56.375 --> 18:58.009
Call this pitch?

18:58.010 --> 19:00.278
The ball came in, did not enter?

19:00.279 --> 19:01.513
Game over, boys,

19:01.514 --> 19:03.515
come on, Pete, has passed
bedtime.

19:03.516 --> 19:06.551
Pete, what is the best
player of all time?

19:06.552 --> 19:07.849
George Mikan.

19:08.220 --> 19:09.084
No

19:09.355 --> 19:10.890
In the semifinals
1950 he made

19:10.891 --> 19:12.392
an average of 31 points per game.

19:12.393 --> 19:13.256
So what?

19:13.325 --> 19:15.160
Okay. And Natt Holmon?

19:15.161 --> 19:17.697
Original Celtics, good
feint, great passes.

19:17.698 --> 19:19.548
Not Very limited.

19:20.633 --> 19:22.567
Limited... get this...

19:22.568 --> 19:24.669
Well, the Dutch Dennert?

19:24.670 --> 19:26.404
He invented the pivot position,

19:26.405 --> 19:28.072
and it was my coach
professional team.

19:28.073 --> 19:30.275
Improved, but it is far.

19:30.276 --> 19:32.477
It is far! Okay, wise guy!

19:32.478 --> 19:36.368
Who was the best player that ever existed
?

19:40.352 --> 19:42.232
Can you tell me, Dad!

19:47.359 --> 19:49.409
This is my boy!

20:02.141 --> 20:03.341
What are you doing?

20:03.342 --> 20:04.400
Running.

20:04.476 --> 20:06.244
But we have a
game in an hour.

20:06.245 --> 20:08.414
I know. I think I have that save energy

20:08.415 --> 20:11.445
to sit on that bench.

20:12.051 --> 20:17.055
My first passion was
officially begun with Sandy,

20:17.056 --> 20:19.115
cheerleader.

20:19.425 --> 20:21.926
I knew I was risking my life

20:21.927 --> 20:24.429
talking with his girlfriend
Buddy Pendleton

20:24.430 --> 20:27.399
but it was beautiful.

20:27.700 --> 20:30.602
My knees were shaking
when I spoke to her.

20:30.603 --> 20:32.443
I saw you in the play.

20:32.938 --> 20:34.337
Will actress?

20:34.540 --> 20:37.134
Oh, sure. Marilyn Monroe.

20:37.676 --> 20:40.011
It will be a movie star?

20:40.012 --> 20:41.372
I think not.

20:42.081 --> 20:44.515
So why is the play?

20:44.516 --> 20:47.553
She must have found me an arrogant fool

20:47.554 --> 20:49.220
but I needed to say.

20:49.221 --> 20:51.937
Why waste time being an actress,

20:51.938 --> 20:55.688
if not he tried to be the best?

21:23.889 --> 21:25.689
Come on, Buddy!

21:25.724 --> 21:27.954
Was missing three
- two!

21:48.113 --> 21:49.580
Technical foul. White.

21:49.581 --> 21:52.185
Number one - zero is out of the game.

21:52.186 --> 21:52.951
Play out?

21:52.952 --> 21:54.085
You lost your mind?

21:54.086 --> 21:55.720
You have to help my boys too.

21:55.721 --> 21:58.021
Get out of here. Time, time!

21:59.124 --> 22:00.694
Come to here!

22:00.726 --> 22:03.376
Needs treatment, zebra!

22:04.096 --> 22:05.365
We will have to make a change.

22:05.366 --> 22:06.264
Maravich, you enter!

22:06.265 --> 22:07.750
Father, you must be kidding
.

22:07.751 --> 22:09.142
You play, I'm the coach.

22:09.143 --> 22:10.935
Go warming, Maravich.

22:10.936 --> 22:12.405
Well, we have to do is the following
...

22:12.406 --> 22:13.337
Press!

22:13.372 --> 22:15.182
It's about time.

22:15.574 --> 22:18.844
Keep track,
enter the game.

22:18.911 --> 22:21.646
Well, son, keep
control, play right.

22:21.647 --> 22:22.715
Ready? Come on.

22:22.716 --> 22:23.715
Is ours is ours.

22:23.716 --> 22:24.515
It is easy, come on.

22:24.516 --> 22:27.266
One, two, three,
Lions! We Will!

22:39.431 --> 22:42.628
Okay,
Buddy! That's right!

22:57.583 --> 22:58.773
I'm free!

23:34.987 --> 23:38.667
Wow, I thought
had a good team.

23:39.091 --> 23:42.251
But we do not
worth a penny!

23:42.394 --> 23:43.494
In thirty years as coach,

23:43.495 --> 23:46.695
deliver never seen a game like this.

23:48.434 --> 23:52.002
And you, Maravich,

23:52.037 --> 23:54.038
that play is great
to the circus,

23:54.039 --> 23:57.341
but for the team of Daniel High,
is poor basketball.

23:57.342 --> 23:59.044
Think of it during the weekend,

23:59.045 --> 24:00.678
and play basketball
how to,

24:00.679 --> 24:02.582
will be able to put the uniform of the team...

24:02.583 --> 24:06.416
if you can not,
forget it.

24:14.626 --> 24:17.756
Hi, Pete... you
played very well.

24:18.330 --> 24:19.590
We lost.

24:20.299 --> 24:22.233
You can not always win.

24:22.234 --> 24:23.101
When we lose,

24:23.102 --> 24:25.712
people remember only this.

24:26.138 --> 24:29.058
I still think you played well.

24:32.111 --> 24:33.611
If you're smart,
will give up.

24:33.612 --> 24:34.732
Just today!

24:34.913 --> 24:36.647
He did not mean it!

24:36.648 --> 24:37.381
Get out of here.

24:37.382 --> 24:39.417
Are you defending him?

24:39.418 --> 24:41.219
It was an accident, Buddy.

24:41.220 --> 24:42.887
Okay. If you are
so you want,

24:42.888 --> 24:46.808
'm going out with the Walker
and the boys today.

24:53.932 --> 24:55.814
As Sandy or anyone else

24:55.815 --> 24:58.945
'd know what I was feeling
?

24:59.204 --> 25:00.068
Buddy.

25:00.739 --> 25:05.199
Hey, Maravich! Very
thanks, sausage!

25:05.978 --> 25:09.213
Losing the game was as
have a knife in the heart.

25:09.214 --> 25:10.982
Me condicionei to believe that

25:10.983 --> 25:14.352
only victory was
acceptable, nothing more.

25:14.353 --> 25:17.173
I had disappointed the team...

25:17.256 --> 25:19.796
fans, Daniel High School

25:19.958 --> 25:22.256
and my hero, my father.

25:28.400 --> 25:31.220
Knew that you find here.

25:41.146 --> 25:43.446
Right acted in that bid.

25:49.454 --> 25:50.504
Know Pete,

25:52.224 --> 25:58.224
you have something that man more
rich world can not buy...

25:58.230 --> 25:59.322
A gift.

26:03.969 --> 26:07.371
Maybe now look like you
does not fit... as...

26:07.372 --> 26:09.532
if I did everything wrong.

26:12.578 --> 26:15.048
But believe me,

26:16.481 --> 26:19.021
you're on the right track.

26:43.442 --> 26:45.042
Your mother and I...

26:46.011 --> 26:50.471
can not afford a university.

26:57.089 --> 26:58.489
But if you indulge in,

26:58.490 --> 27:00.542
and use this gift that God gave him
,

27:00.543 --> 27:02.561
will one day play
in the team.

27:02.562 --> 27:03.824
I know, son

27:06.999 --> 27:08.099
And if really good, for

27:08.100 --> 27:11.370
will get a scholarship /

27:11.637 --> 27:13.204
maybe play with the pros,

27:13.205 --> 27:15.855
and join the championship...

27:16.241 --> 27:19.891
I think I heard these words
thousand times.

27:20.979 --> 27:23.649
And tonight I realized

27:23.650 --> 27:25.880
I wanted to be "Pistol".

27:41.133 --> 27:43.567
Now is me

27:44.102 --> 27:47.162
I will change the situation

27:47.639 --> 27:52.975
appears the desire seed

27:54.579 --> 28:00.950
Reviving the ashes in the little heart

28:02.087 --> 28:08.048
Awake, awake the flame

28:08.360 --> 28:11.420
Now is me

28:11.530 --> 28:15.399
No one will stop me

28:15.434 --> 28:20.303
Now is me again

28:22.140 --> 28:25.234
Now is me

28:25.544 --> 28:31.380
My path will follow

28:32.451 --> 28:35.352
I discovered what it takes

28:35.887 --> 28:38.617
<i>E tracks will not let</i>

28:39.324 --> 28:41.060
I will break the chains

28:41.061 --> 28:44.393
That put me

28:46.898 --> 28:52.268
And find this hope, shining far

28:53.038 --> 28:59.876
The price to continue on my way

29:00.045 --> 29:03.037
Now is me

29:03.181 --> 29:06.917
No one will stop me

29:06.952 --> 29:11.946
Now it's me again

29:13.625 --> 29:16.924
Now is me

29:17.129 --> 29:22.931
My path will follow

29:34.379 --> 29:37.614
Now is me

29:37.649 --> 29:41.251
No one will stop me

29:41.286 --> 29:46.485
Now it's me again

29:48.193 --> 29:51.253
Now is me

29:51.430 --> 29:59.166
My path will follow

30:01.273 --> 30:07.405
I will follow

30:41.079 --> 30:46.389
So you told Pete that
would be better to leave the team?

30:47.586 --> 30:49.056
We talked.

30:50.455 --> 30:53.691
As always, my
opinion does not count.

30:53.692 --> 30:55.125
But, Helen, is...

30:55.126 --> 30:57.495
This is the real problem
, Press.

30:57.496 --> 31:00.364
You are always fighting against windmills.

31:00.365 --> 31:01.935
Hold on.

31:04.269 --> 31:06.009
What do you mean?

31:06.404 --> 31:09.375
It's okay if you want to fight the tide
,

31:09.376 --> 31:11.477
but his son to do the same?

31:11.478 --> 31:13.048
Hold on.

31:13.245 --> 31:15.075
A few weeks ago you happy

31:15.076 --> 31:16.914
because Pete
joined the team.

31:16.915 --> 31:19.151
I was happy because I know how

31:19.152 --> 31:21.285
he wants to be like you /

31:21.286 --> 31:23.521
join the team owner to 13 years.

31:23.522 --> 31:25.222
But it will not happen,

31:25.223 --> 31:27.258
because everything
Vern see Pendleton

31:27.259 --> 31:30.429
is a boy of 1.60
tall and 40 pounds.

31:30.430 --> 31:31.948
Helen, you do not understand

31:31.949 --> 31:33.397
which he is living.

31:33.398 --> 31:35.083
I know Pete is suffering.

31:35.084 --> 31:36.861
Of course he is suffering
.

31:36.862 --> 31:38.569
When I was his age,

31:38.570 --> 31:41.238
wanted out of steel
in Aliquippa.

31:41.239 --> 31:43.475
My lungs were full of dark smoke,

31:43.476 --> 31:45.578
and my hands were rough

31:45.579 --> 31:47.611
to work 15 hours a day.

31:47.612 --> 31:50.481
Think I do not
was suffering?

31:50.482 --> 31:53.250
But it builds character, Helen,

31:53.251 --> 31:55.816
That pain there in the soul of background

31:55.817 --> 31:58.877
encouraged me to be something better!

32:01.526 --> 32:04.628
I can train you up out of breath
,

32:04.629 --> 32:07.266
but while he did not feel
something that burns your soul,

32:07.267 --> 32:09.900
My words are worthless.

32:09.901 --> 32:12.331
But he's just a boy.

32:15.507 --> 32:16.405
I know.

32:44.102 --> 32:47.932
Children usually prefer a teddy bear.

32:56.715 --> 32:58.484
It's hard to be a child seeking

32:58.485 --> 33:00.675
adult dream.

33:04.522 --> 33:07.891
In all the pain and confusion
, I knew

33:07.892 --> 33:10.427
I had to continue
seeking my dream,

33:10.428 --> 33:13.296
for my father and me,

33:13.331 --> 33:15.601
even more nobody understood

33:15.602 --> 33:17.501
what was going on in me.

33:17.502 --> 33:20.471
When the excitement and pressure
dominated me,

33:20.472 --> 33:24.508
I plunged the years
Dad had taught me.

33:24.509 --> 33:27.119
Control at your fingertips,

33:27.312 --> 33:30.008
Followed by wrist flexion.

33:31.182 --> 33:33.792
Control at your fingertips,

33:34.085 --> 33:36.645
followed by wrist flexion.

33:38.223 --> 33:40.591
Control at your fingertips,

33:40.592 --> 33:43.132
followed by wrist flexion.

33:44.262 --> 33:46.114
In those lonely nights,

33:46.115 --> 33:48.087
my father exercises the

33:48.088 --> 33:50.318
helped me to continue.

33:50.602 --> 33:53.212
Control at your fingertips,

33:53.304 --> 33:55.844
followed by wrist flexion.

34:00.512 --> 34:02.946
Some people seek reasons to dislike you.

34:02.947 --> 34:04.214
Four weeks have passed since

34:04.215 --> 34:05.582
I attained
Buddy's face.

34:05.583 --> 34:07.184
I still felt alone

34:07.185 --> 34:10.154
like a fish upstream.

34:10.155 --> 34:11.989
Hey, Elf, would
is allowed to carry

34:11.991 --> 34:14.741
basketball
in the hallway?

34:18.063 --> 34:19.463
Eighth grade...

34:20.931 --> 34:22.966
Okay. As you know,

34:22.967 --> 34:24.652
every day this quarter

34:24.654 --> 34:26.304
ask students to tell

34:26.306 --> 34:28.775
your dreams for the future.

34:29.708 --> 34:32.040
Peter, now it's your turn.

34:40.685 --> 34:42.321
My dream is to get a scholarship

34:42.322 --> 34:45.389
university to play basketball.

34:45.389 --> 34:47.255
Class! That's enough.

34:47.425 --> 34:48.891
Continue, Peter.

34:48.893 --> 34:51.230
And I'll be the first man to win

34:51.231 --> 34:52.731
a million dollars playing

34:52.732 --> 34:54.697
basketball professionally.

34:54.699 --> 34:56.360
Hey, hey!

34:58.169 --> 35:00.655
Also want to play in the first team

35:00.656 --> 35:03.108
and earn a range of best player

35:03.109 --> 35:06.099
of basketball ever.

35:07.212 --> 35:09.862
You can sit,
Peter. Thank you.

35:12.016 --> 35:13.142
I...

35:13.351 --> 35:16.721
wanted to talk to you about Pete.

35:17.455 --> 35:21.492
Look... or he is good
for the team or not.

35:21.493 --> 35:23.627
But if you're using Pete

35:23.628 --> 35:25.062
only to train your players,

35:25.063 --> 35:26.930
then it is more ignorant than I thought
.

35:26.931 --> 35:27.931
Hold on, mate,

35:27.932 --> 35:29.101
you are passing the limit now.

35:29.102 --> 35:30.292
I'm really?

35:31.336 --> 35:32.969
Just want to know

35:33.004 --> 35:35.005
Because you are not putting
Pete to play.

35:35.006 --> 35:37.726
He needs to mature, Press.

35:39.110 --> 35:43.280
Mature. He has more discipline

35:43.315 --> 35:47.451
and maturity that his first team.

35:47.952 --> 35:50.942
And that includes Buddy, his son.

35:52.657 --> 35:55.659
Press, we will not take it personally
.

35:55.660 --> 35:57.594
Of course, your child
has some talent,

35:57.595 --> 36:01.385
it just needs to be controlled and cut
.

36:01.533 --> 36:02.916
But when you have a good horse,

36:02.917 --> 36:05.569
arises him to compete
, Vern.

36:05.570 --> 36:07.137
Technical, not
wanted to say this,

36:07.138 --> 36:09.940
but this appears to me
pressing.

36:09.941 --> 36:11.059
Well, go ahead and tell
because

36:11.060 --> 36:12.144
I would give any thing to know

36:12.145 --> 36:15.279
what's going on
on his head.

36:15.280 --> 36:19.000
Well, your child
involved in problems.

36:20.385 --> 36:21.715
I'm listening.

36:21.986 --> 36:24.990
He learned to play
like that with blacks.

36:24.991 --> 36:28.911
I saw him playing the
other side of the rail.

36:29.561 --> 36:31.061
I hate to tell you this,

36:31.062 --> 36:34.231
but I think you
needed to know.

36:34.232 --> 36:35.566
Of course, this kind of thing works

36:35.567 --> 36:37.901
with Globe Trotters,
but in a real game...

36:37.902 --> 36:39.071
you saw what happened when

36:39.072 --> 36:40.037
I put to play.

36:40.038 --> 36:42.072
He almost broke the nose of Buddy!

36:42.073 --> 36:44.723
You are joking, technical.

36:45.009 --> 36:47.578
I think your son
should take that pass.

36:47.579 --> 36:51.582
The only game that Pete
know is instinctively

36:51.583 --> 36:53.018
it will not stop
for 10 minutes

36:53.019 --> 36:53.984
thinking in the pass,

36:53.985 --> 36:55.652
he will not give
no warning.

36:55.653 --> 36:57.454
Not understand what I'm saying?

36:57.455 --> 37:01.325
He knew Buddy
was free, he knew!

37:01.326 --> 37:04.428
Pete has bids
ever seen,

37:04.429 --> 37:08.289
and you're chaining
a born winner.

37:08.299 --> 37:11.389
Why do not you
the loose, huh?

37:11.903 --> 37:15.373
Why do not
gives you a chance?

37:16.841 --> 37:17.608
What are you doing, Dad?

37:17.609 --> 37:19.077
"Man to man", or "zone"?

37:19.078 --> 37:20.528
Shut Walk!
Man to man.

37:20.529 --> 37:22.346
Ok 'Man on
man.'. Come on.

37:22.347 --> 37:24.437
One, two, three, Lions!

37:32.891 --> 37:37.091
Oh, please! Lock
there and rebounds!

37:52.477 --> 37:53.466
Pete!

37:56.080 --> 37:57.082
How are you feeling?

37:57.083 --> 37:57.946
Well

37:58.416 --> 38:00.956
Damn, look at that pass!

38:05.990 --> 38:08.460
I thought you would get.

38:22.040 --> 38:23.408
Look blocking and rebounds.

38:23.409 --> 38:25.809
A rebound is too much to ask?

38:28.146 --> 38:29.010
Pete!

38:32.083 --> 38:33.350
Knew is not it?

38:33.351 --> 38:34.249
How?

38:34.352 --> 38:35.953
The pass for Buddy.

38:35.954 --> 38:37.120
I think so.

38:37.121 --> 38:38.588
How did you know
he was free?

38:38.589 --> 38:39.851
Only knew.

38:40.658 --> 38:42.748
Okay, can sit.

38:58.009 --> 39:00.999
Pete enters the
place of Walker.

39:03.982 --> 39:06.242
Hey, will you mark me?

39:17.462 --> 39:20.597
Cannfield, that does not
is the son of Maravich?

39:20.598 --> 39:21.462
Is.

39:50.228 --> 39:52.978
's Killing them, Pete.

39:53.131 --> 39:54.601
Calm, Maravich!

40:24.629 --> 40:27.097
Hey, kid!

40:27.198 --> 40:28.433
Where did you learn to shoot like that?

40:28.434 --> 40:29.633
In the backyard.

40:29.634 --> 40:32.002
Know flinging the
waist like a gunslinger?

40:32.003 --> 40:32.883
Thank you.

40:41.179 --> 40:42.009
Father!

40:42.246 --> 40:43.110
Hi!

40:44.115 --> 40:45.916
What are you doing here?

40:45.917 --> 40:49.419
I was thinking about the victory of yesterday.

40:49.420 --> 40:51.221
Have you read the papers?

40:51.222 --> 40:52.154
No

40:53.091 --> 40:54.731
Should have read.

40:55.626 --> 40:56.676
Listen to this.

40:59.163 --> 41:00.949
The basketball team of Daniel High School

41:00.950 --> 41:02.666
guaranteed entertainment last night,

41:02.667 --> 41:04.970
thanks to the talent of a
eighth-grader,

41:04.971 --> 41:06.301
Pete Maravich.

41:06.304 --> 41:07.906
Daniel High School gym did not see much movement

41:07.907 --> 41:11.697
from the prom
closure of football.

41:11.876 --> 41:13.411
The team traditionally
formed by high school students

41:13.412 --> 41:16.113
led by Buddy Pendleton

41:16.114 --> 41:19.649
gained new air with the small
Maravich leading the pack.

41:19.650 --> 41:21.651
He did not lead anything, Dad!

41:21.652 --> 41:25.122
What matters is that we are winning
.

41:25.123 --> 41:26.173
It gets worse.

41:27.191 --> 41:29.926
Sometimes, the
fellow Pistol Pete...

41:29.927 --> 41:34.498
"Pistol Pete".
What business is that of "Pistol Pete"?

41:34.499 --> 41:38.299
It is a stage name
as Houdini.

41:39.737 --> 41:42.697
Can you believe this shit?

41:43.441 --> 41:45.841
If you want to say something, say it!

41:46.477 --> 41:48.278
I want Maravich
off the team.

41:48.279 --> 41:49.414
We need to drive the team

41:49.415 --> 41:50.515
and no one likes him.

41:50.516 --> 41:51.500
Why not?

41:51.501 --> 41:52.411
Now father,

41:52.416 --> 41:54.052
it's a boy
silly eighth grade

41:54.053 --> 41:55.153
and we are high school.

41:55.154 --> 41:56.514
And the tradition?

41:56.521 --> 41:57.721
What about her?

41:57.722 --> 42:00.056
Always scale senior students.

42:00.057 --> 42:02.371
As I said, what matters

42:02.372 --> 42:05.362
is the column wins and losses.

42:05.596 --> 42:08.726
Was even thinking in scale it.

42:08.900 --> 42:10.640
Instead of whom?

42:11.235 --> 42:14.033
In Walk or yours.

42:17.909 --> 42:19.244
I know people are saying that we have a chance

42:19.245 --> 42:20.710
in the state semifinals,

42:20.711 --> 42:22.047
and this will not happen to the Maravich

42:22.048 --> 42:23.688
dividing the team.

42:24.682 --> 42:26.672
I'll think about it, son.

42:27.151 --> 42:29.686
Freezes him today, Dad.
It would be the best decision.

42:29.687 --> 42:31.288
We give you all the support.

42:31.289 --> 42:33.489
Mainly Walker.

42:37.528 --> 42:39.264
Had started playing a few weeks ago

42:39.265 --> 42:40.897
and the school was winning,

42:40.898 --> 42:43.433
But wanted to improve my game.

42:43.434 --> 42:44.568
How to do this?

42:44.569 --> 42:46.449
My father taught me.

42:46.671 --> 42:48.002
Want to try?

42:48.105 --> 42:49.590
All day I went to College Clemson

42:49.591 --> 42:51.363
and Dad handed me some new training

42:51.364 --> 42:53.543
who called Task Basketball,

42:53.544 --> 42:56.313
the only task
I like to do.

42:56.314 --> 42:58.448
One day the Moose
came to me.

42:58.449 --> 43:00.118
It seems he wanted a scholarship

43:00.119 --> 43:01.318
much as I, and was willing

43:01.319 --> 43:04.654
put at risk its reputation
with the team.

43:04.655 --> 43:06.856
I decided to give you an introduction

43:06.857 --> 43:09.326
to see if it was
even a dreamer.

43:09.327 --> 43:13.117
Try this. My father
calls "blowback."

43:24.909 --> 43:28.478
There is no one to show us the way

43:28.479 --> 43:31.539
Together we are

43:36.320 --> 43:39.448
We are the dreamers

43:40.324 --> 43:43.054
really believe

43:43.561 --> 43:46.655
encourage each other

43:48.232 --> 43:50.996
to continue

44:07.585 --> 44:10.884
We wink

44:11.689 --> 44:15.526
E
in our dreams are heroes

44:15.561 --> 44:18.393
We dream the same thing

44:19.497 --> 44:23.434
We pray all night
protection

44:23.469 --> 44:27.336
Side by side, we will see life

44:27.405 --> 44:30.169
Creating the future

44:31.309 --> 44:33.259
This day will come

44:33.294 --> 44:35.209
Not so far

44:35.279 --> 44:38.043
Venceremos together

44:43.087 --> 44:46.318
We are the dreamers

44:47.124 --> 44:49.922
really believe

44:50.361 --> 44:53.455
We encourage each other

44:55.099 --> 44:57.897
to continue

44:58.703 --> 45:01.968
We are the dreamers

45:02.506 --> 45:05.532
really believe

45:05.643 --> 45:09.010
encourage each other

45:10.514 --> 45:13.347
to continue.

45:32.436 --> 45:36.106
Okay Other than that my father taught
is the "Booty fast. "

45:36.107 --> 45:37.887
You can try, Moose.

45:39.243 --> 45:43.863
Place your hands as if it were
draw their pistols.

45:43.914 --> 45:47.117
Clap in front and
catch the ball behind you.

45:47.118 --> 45:48.987
Focus, and
whatever,

45:48.988 --> 45:51.458
not pay attention to me.

45:52.490 --> 45:53.548
I do this.

45:55.659 --> 45:57.919
See the speed of the Walk.

45:58.095 --> 45:59.285
Are you ready?

46:02.166 --> 46:05.067
Barnes. You try, CD.

46:09.640 --> 46:12.560
Okay. Do not pay attention to me
.

46:14.979 --> 46:17.313
Hey, Buddy. Come
try. You can.

46:17.314 --> 46:19.784
I do not do circus acts.

46:20.651 --> 46:23.711
I gamble Pete
can do.

46:26.424 --> 46:27.334
Look.

46:29.393 --> 46:31.461
Had not yet conquered all,

46:31.462 --> 46:34.072
but Sandy seemed to support me,

46:34.131 --> 46:35.996
even from a distance.

46:39.537 --> 46:41.472
Now see what happens
this attack.

46:41.473 --> 46:43.391
The side is the light trap
about this man,

46:43.392 --> 46:45.276
while the owners go out at the same time.

46:45.277 --> 46:47.076
One here, another there.

46:47.077 --> 46:48.846
Do not let him
tire your ears.

46:48.847 --> 46:50.414
You can go home
whenever they want.

46:50.415 --> 46:53.216
Honey, have some thing
burning?

46:53.217 --> 46:55.987
The pivot crosses the lane,
makes a light trap

46:55.988 --> 46:57.222
the defender while the other side

46:57.223 --> 46:58.321
crosses the bottom line.

46:58.322 --> 46:59.452
I'm not cooking anything.

46:59.453 --> 47:00.590
Then find something.

47:00.591 --> 47:03.893
Watch now.
It's very simple.

47:03.894 --> 47:05.495
Santa could talk all night

47:05.496 --> 47:07.530
about his two favorite subjects:

47:07.531 --> 47:09.158
Basketball and me.

47:09.667 --> 47:11.835
But the same style of play

47:11.836 --> 47:14.272
that would make people scream
and stay in Peach

47:14.273 --> 47:16.608
twenty years later,
gave to sleep

47:16.609 --> 47:19.236
major technical of the country.

47:23.481 --> 47:25.881
Pete See, for example.

47:25.950 --> 47:27.417
Right here in my house,

47:27.418 --> 47:29.953
have the guardian of the future.

47:29.954 --> 47:31.985
It can act in a blink of an eye
,

47:31.986 --> 47:35.091
and let the defense
scratching his head.

47:35.092 --> 47:38.096
Of course, a game
so worthless

47:38.097 --> 47:39.512
if you have five players

47:39.513 --> 47:41.664
on the court that do work.

47:41.665 --> 47:47.365
Otherwise...
is like talking to the wind.

47:52.643 --> 47:53.663
Understand?

48:08.325 --> 48:10.627
Hey! Good story, right?

48:10.628 --> 48:12.596
Pistol Pete and Moose!

48:13.430 --> 48:17.833
Dr. Pepper, two!
Let me see, Myron.

48:23.941 --> 48:26.551
Very Good, Pete, that's right.

48:27.478 --> 48:29.412
I am teaching the Moose.

48:29.413 --> 48:32.148
It will achieve
a scholarship!

48:32.149 --> 48:33.343
The Moose?

48:33.951 --> 48:35.171
It is the Moose.

48:35.486 --> 48:38.182
He is starting well.

48:38.856 --> 48:41.224
The attention of the media is the key.

48:41.225 --> 48:44.160
He is playing for the best state of the team.

48:44.161 --> 48:46.029
And that team is this, Mr. Carl?

48:46.030 --> 48:47.330
Myron, does not come with this.

48:47.331 --> 48:48.831
You know very well.

48:49.133 --> 48:50.633
Believe me I know it.

48:50.634 --> 48:53.034
You and your silly ideas.

48:55.272 --> 48:56.136
What?

48:58.042 --> 49:00.677
He thinks the Lions should
play with Cleveland.

49:00.678 --> 49:03.079
He says it's the best
State team.

49:03.080 --> 49:04.380
A black team?

49:04.381 --> 49:05.811
Is not hilarious?

49:08.185 --> 49:09.375
Let's play.

49:11.055 --> 49:13.457
It's just a dream, Pete.

49:13.492 --> 49:14.424
That's it.

49:15.025 --> 49:17.285
They are the best or not?

49:17.294 --> 49:19.819
Of course they are!

49:32.676 --> 49:36.016
Too young to know the defeat

49:36.080 --> 49:39.548
Ajuventude also has weaknesses

49:39.583 --> 49:43.016
We can not measure heart and soul

49:43.120 --> 49:46.453
Just keep them under control

49:46.624 --> 49:50.253
When we know our road

49:50.961 --> 49:54.397
We will forward
for that plan

49:54.398 --> 49:57.265
A fine line divides

49:57.334 --> 50:01.293
Facing the fear or flee

50:02.439 --> 50:06.307
From dream to the destination

50:06.377 --> 50:07.377
Double or nothing.

50:07.378 --> 50:10.538
This is the fifth
'double or nothing'.

50:13.684 --> 50:15.251
Wait until tomorrow, Pete.

50:15.252 --> 50:20.588
In life only is there no inside or outside

50:20.691 --> 50:24.161
There is a burning desire in us

50:24.196 --> 50:27.631
That shines all night

50:27.666 --> 50:30.930
Do not be discouraged

50:31.301 --> 50:34.964
Keep in mind your dream

50:35.272 --> 50:38.332
During the
nightmares of his life

50:38.375 --> 50:41.037
Do not be discouraged

50:47.518 --> 50:50.487
There is no place for souvenirs

50:50.954 --> 50:54.508
There are today or tomorrow

50:54.543 --> 50:58.062
In difficult times

50:58.097 --> 51:01.429
Choose continue

51:01.498 --> 51:05.059
Some live only to see the day

51:05.135 --> 51:08.537
Others live for their dreams

51:08.572 --> 51:12.676
never feel the heat
, as you

51:12.711 --> 51:16.476
There is a distance in his hand

51:17.214 --> 51:21.116
From dream to the destination

51:22.119 --> 51:27.580
<i>Now, there is nothing more</i>

51:28.392 --> 51:31.452
Do not be discouraged

51:31.895 --> 51:35.387
There is no victory without a fight

51:44.575 --> 51:47.343
He's eating you alive
, Walker!

51:47.344 --> 51:49.294
Walk, finish him!

51:53.917 --> 51:55.247
Ok Combined..

52:02.092 --> 52:03.142
Half an hour.

52:03.460 --> 52:04.327
Are you kidding?

52:04.328 --> 52:05.528
He can in an hour.

52:05.529 --> 52:06.462
What's going on?

52:06.463 --> 52:08.164
I saw your car out front.

52:08.165 --> 52:11.000
We are making a bet with Maravich.

52:11.001 --> 52:15.541
He has to turn the ball
finger for an hour.

52:16.173 --> 52:19.142
Start when the pointer
the second hand is at 12.

52:19.143 --> 52:20.411
Stay here,
girls if they want

52:20.412 --> 52:22.192
see something funny.

52:22.880 --> 52:26.010
One for the money, two for the show
.

52:26.250 --> 52:29.590
Come on. Prepare,
point, and fire!

52:44.234 --> 52:46.034
Come on!

52:46.303 --> 52:48.066
Look at this, folks.

52:50.140 --> 52:51.539
Come on, Pete.

52:58.749 --> 53:00.516
Come on, Pete, focus.

53:00.517 --> 53:01.586
Come on, Pete!

53:01.587 --> 53:02.576
Enough!

53:04.521 --> 53:05.655
I can not!

53:05.656 --> 53:06.916
Can not?

53:07.191 --> 53:08.954
I can not stop.

53:12.362 --> 53:13.552
Come on, Pete!

53:16.066 --> 53:18.000
Come on! You can!

53:45.696 --> 53:47.965
He's getting tired
, Buddy,

53:47.966 --> 53:49.886
is getting tired.

53:54.338 --> 53:56.932
You can! Come on, Pete!

54:07.317 --> 54:09.127
Hey, where you going?

54:17.895 --> 54:20.195
Can you, Mr. Peter.

54:21.131 --> 54:23.361
Where did you learn to drive?

54:55.966 --> 54:57.700
Come on, Pete! You can!

54:57.701 --> 54:59.100
15 seconds!

55:00.370 --> 55:01.770
You did it!

55:02.940 --> 55:06.243
Nine, eight,
seven, six, five,

55:06.278 --> 55:09.212
four, three, two, one!

55:18.922 --> 55:22.782
Your tricks will end
soon, Petey.

55:38.909 --> 55:40.859
Okay! Hey, judge!

55:41.912 --> 55:43.202
In your face!

56:17.581 --> 56:19.841
They find that it's cool?

56:20.317 --> 56:23.717
He told me
you are a banana.

56:25.188 --> 56:27.068
Said yes. I heard.

56:27.290 --> 56:30.140
Said you was a banana.

56:40.203 --> 56:41.033
!

56:49.946 --> 56:50.928
Nice move!

56:50.929 --> 56:51.842
Thank you!

57:07.164 --> 57:09.114
You're crazy, judge!

57:16.239 --> 57:16.938
Pete!

57:16.973 --> 57:19.008
We are watching the same game?

57:19.009 --> 57:20.499
# 5...

57:23.513 --> 57:25.314
Expected, Press.
It is cold.

57:25.315 --> 57:26.885
Call a physician.

57:40.263 --> 57:41.430
How do you feel?

57:41.431 --> 57:42.861
I'll be fine.

57:43.166 --> 57:44.526
Let me see.

57:47.137 --> 57:49.777
It was a difficult game, right?

57:50.307 --> 57:54.787
The doctor said you
had a mild concussion.

57:56.680 --> 57:58.045
This makes me remember when

57:58.046 --> 58:00.836
played for Pittsburgh Ironmen.

58:01.051 --> 58:04.253
They sewed me after every game.

58:04.254 --> 58:07.389
They called us
Iron Team.

58:07.390 --> 58:09.158
Because you were tough?

58:09.159 --> 58:13.061
No, they could only pay
5 players.

58:25.075 --> 58:28.144
Looking into the eyes of my father I understood.

58:28.145 --> 58:30.112
He did not need to say anything.

58:30.113 --> 58:32.681
Could not face the guy who hurt me

58:32.682 --> 58:35.319
but no way he would knock me

58:35.320 --> 58:37.052
and keep out of the game.

58:37.053 --> 58:39.089
Sitting there, I remembered the ten games

58:39.090 --> 58:40.589
I stayed on the bench.

58:40.590 --> 58:42.193
I tried to pretend it did not bother me,

58:42.194 --> 58:44.024
bothered but yes.

58:44.327 --> 58:46.695
This was the moment of truth for me
.

58:46.696 --> 58:50.599
A chance to make a choice
and prove him wrong.

58:50.600 --> 58:52.501
My body said "No"

58:52.502 --> 58:56.233
but my heart cried out: "Give a show."

58:58.508 --> 58:59.743
They are destroying us in the marking.

58:59.744 --> 59:00.676
We will mark by zone.

59:00.677 --> 59:02.213
But they are attacking
out, Dad!

59:02.214 --> 59:03.348
But they are getting underneath.

59:03.349 --> 59:04.413
You can let
I mark the center.

59:04.414 --> 59:07.151
Walk, lock and cuts
the bottom line.

59:07.152 --> 59:08.184
Father, give me the ball.

59:08.185 --> 59:09.385
Moves to me.

59:09.386 --> 59:11.388
Pete, what is
doing here?

59:11.389 --> 59:12.888
You can not enter.

59:12.889 --> 59:15.226
Mom, I could play this game
blindfolded.

59:15.227 --> 59:16.292
Let him play, Helen.

59:16.293 --> 59:18.661
We can become more violent in
marking, technical.

59:18.662 --> 59:21.098
Walk, when I die
you stay in my place.

59:21.099 --> 59:22.367
But as this, be quiet.

59:22.368 --> 59:23.601
Gave to understand?
Yes, sir.

59:23.602 --> 59:24.625
Look!

59:27.837 --> 59:38.338
Pistol, Pistol,
Pistol, Pistol

59:38.615 --> 59:39.581
All right, son?

59:39.582 --> 59:40.772
Yes, sir.

59:44.087 --> 59:45.588
Walk, go to the bank.

59:45.589 --> 59:47.491
Who will score the
center for you?

59:47.492 --> 59:48.626
Walk, how old are you?

59:48.627 --> 59:49.491
Eighteen.

59:49.526 --> 59:50.961
Either until the nineteen live?

59:50.962 --> 59:51.560
Yes, sir.

59:51.561 --> 59:54.551
So do what you're told
!

59:55.665 --> 59:59.136
Let's finish them. One, two, three...

59:59.137 --> 01:00:00.000
Lions!

01:00:22.959 --> 01:00:25.985
Pistol! That's it!

01:00:33.536 --> 01:00:36.256
Pistol, Pistol,
Pistol, Pistol

01:00:39.142 --> 01:00:40.402
Exchange, exchange!

01:00:43.713 --> 01:00:45.113
Pass, watch out!

01:01:07.237 --> 01:01:09.467
One, two, three... Lions!

01:01:12.542 --> 01:01:15.312
There's more chicken and
pod if they want!

01:01:15.313 --> 01:01:16.713
Thank you, Carl.

01:01:17.113 --> 01:01:19.082
Need muscles for the final,

01:01:19.083 --> 01:01:22.017
and green beans is good to give
muscles.

01:01:22.018 --> 01:01:24.420
Said the same thing about
cauliflower.

01:01:24.421 --> 01:01:25.988
Want to get high, do not you?

01:01:25.989 --> 01:01:27.179
Yes, sir.

01:01:27.223 --> 01:01:28.623
You never heard of

01:01:28.624 --> 01:01:30.059
a tall guy called Pod?

01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:31.118
Father!

01:01:32.529 --> 01:01:35.689
Myron! Iced tea to the table
3.

01:01:36.433 --> 01:01:38.302
I'm coming,
Carl. Thank U.

01:01:38.303 --> 01:01:39.335
Hello, you guys.

01:01:39.336 --> 01:01:42.206
I felt the smell of chicken
Myron a mile away.

01:01:42.207 --> 01:01:44.173
And the taste is even better!

01:01:44.174 --> 01:01:46.194
Good that appeared.

01:01:46.309 --> 01:01:47.949
Pull up a chair.

01:01:51.715 --> 01:01:54.045
Good that invited me.

01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:57.019
Nobody does fried chicken
as Myron.

01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:58.800
Thank you, Mr. Vern.

01:01:59.189 --> 01:02:01.775
I know Myron some 12 years /

01:02:01.776 --> 01:02:04.328
when he cut my grass.

01:02:04.329 --> 01:02:05.561
Yes, sir. It's true.

01:02:05.562 --> 01:02:07.843
Since 1949, when I worked

01:02:07.844 --> 01:02:11.044
for you in
Division Street.

01:02:11.134 --> 01:02:14.024
Doctor Pepper,
on my own.

01:02:15.472 --> 01:02:16.872
Thank you, Carl.

01:02:17.006 --> 01:02:19.143
Myron, prepares another
meat portion.

01:02:19.144 --> 01:02:22.977
They are very kind to me.

01:02:24.314 --> 01:02:27.444
Will not ask for a loan
, are they?

01:02:28.618 --> 01:02:32.268
You're busy
after dinner?

01:02:32.522 --> 01:02:37.042
Josephine has a date
missionary in the church.

01:02:37.227 --> 01:02:38.489
I'm free.

01:02:40.663 --> 01:02:42.643
What's on your mind?

01:02:43.099 --> 01:02:46.626
State championship.
Not official.

01:02:47.971 --> 01:02:49.165
What?

01:02:51.374 --> 01:02:56.676
Tonight, we'll
take you to the future.

01:03:15.465 --> 01:03:18.285
I hope that explains it here.

01:03:18.301 --> 01:03:21.601
Go figure in a minute or two.

01:03:24.574 --> 01:03:26.308
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
,

01:03:26.309 --> 01:03:30.099
are welcome to
Cleveland High School.

01:03:30.947 --> 01:03:32.407
What is this?

01:03:32.649 --> 01:03:35.083
Press, care
with the wallet.

01:03:35.084 --> 01:03:37.087
Prepare for the Cleveland Kings

01:03:37.088 --> 01:03:41.217
and its captain, Joe Pro!

01:03:44.093 --> 01:03:45.943
You are feeling, Vern?

01:03:45.995 --> 01:03:47.595
It's show time.

01:03:59.476 --> 01:04:04.026
My parents are turning
in the tomb, for sure.

01:04:10.987 --> 01:04:14.320
Okay, okay.
Very well, very well.

01:04:39.182 --> 01:04:43.175
So? You did not say much.

01:04:44.587 --> 01:04:46.054
Whatever I say:

01:04:46.055 --> 01:04:48.490
this is the
future of basketball?

01:04:48.491 --> 01:04:50.161
You are who you say.

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:52.580
Now Press, please.

01:04:52.996 --> 01:04:54.464
Okay, can at least admit

01:04:54.465 --> 01:04:56.398
that Cleveland is good?

01:04:56.399 --> 01:04:57.869
I can agree.

01:04:58.535 --> 01:05:00.702
I think they can beat you.

01:05:00.703 --> 01:05:03.033
What is the point, coach?

01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:06.642
The point is that you have the opportunity

01:05:06.643 --> 01:05:09.943
to stand out on this side of the country.

01:05:10.313 --> 01:05:13.482
Basketball
have to walk in this direction.

01:05:13.483 --> 01:05:16.093
You also felt it there.

01:05:16.119 --> 01:05:18.019
Are you crazy?

01:05:18.855 --> 01:05:20.889
Are you afraid of?

01:05:20.890 --> 01:05:22.491
Are you saying that black

01:05:22.492 --> 01:05:23.659
are better than us?

01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:27.480
I'm saying it's time to change.

01:05:28.965 --> 01:05:30.966
If you use the points
strong style,

01:05:30.967 --> 01:05:34.536
and add their style
- and you have everything.

01:05:34.537 --> 01:05:38.987
Even the league you want so long.

01:05:39.509 --> 01:05:42.578
Press, I thank
what you're saying,

01:05:42.579 --> 01:05:45.264
but I feel
tell you, mate,

01:05:45.265 --> 01:05:47.983
some things will never change.

01:05:47.984 --> 01:05:51.704
Need to open the mind to new ideas
.

01:05:53.590 --> 01:05:56.458
Why does not the idea
playing with them?

01:05:56.459 --> 01:05:58.891
Otherwise it will be a false victory in the championship
,

01:05:58.892 --> 01:06:03.342
because you have not faced
the state's best.

01:06:05.368 --> 01:06:07.008
Goodnight Press.

01:06:09.138 --> 01:06:12.478
Good night, Pete.
Good evening, technical.

01:06:21.317 --> 01:06:27.278
Vern! Do something unexpected
once in a lifetime.

01:06:35.231 --> 01:06:37.399
Were the regional finals.

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:39.202
The newspaper said that the champion

01:06:39.203 --> 01:06:40.971
Conquer the state title.

01:06:40.972 --> 01:06:42.992
Come on! Attention there!

01:06:47.543 --> 01:06:49.646
With the play set,
I started thinking

01:06:49.647 --> 01:06:51.680
If the technical Pendleton had understood

01:06:51.681 --> 01:06:55.450
vision of my father on
the future of basketball.

01:06:55.451 --> 01:06:57.067
Maybe win the state championship

01:06:57.068 --> 01:07:00.055
also was not enough for him.

01:07:00.056 --> 01:07:03.260
But everyone knew that he hated the idea

01:07:03.261 --> 01:07:06.923
losing to anyone...

01:07:07.296 --> 01:07:10.666
and this included
team Cleveland.

01:07:31.454 --> 01:07:33.024
Okay, listen.

01:07:34.490 --> 01:07:36.930
Sit relax. Listen.

01:07:41.698 --> 01:07:43.398
It was great, was not it?

01:07:43.399 --> 01:07:45.702
I have been thinking a lot about what it means

01:07:45.703 --> 01:07:48.501
Be the best state of the team,

01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:53.908
and... until a few days ago

01:07:53.943 --> 01:07:57.946
I thought we were the better
State team.

01:07:57.947 --> 01:08:00.215
We are the best, technical.

01:08:00.216 --> 01:08:02.275
True. You are right.

01:08:03.152 --> 01:08:07.020
We are the best "team
white" state.

01:08:07.557 --> 01:08:09.825
Well, that's what matters.

01:08:09.826 --> 01:08:11.927
What other team there?

01:08:11.928 --> 01:08:13.862
Cleveland High.

01:08:15.364 --> 01:08:17.194
Blacks?

01:08:17.899 --> 01:08:20.649
What are trying to say, Dad?

01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:23.371
Unless we beat the Cleveland
,

01:08:23.372 --> 01:08:28.721
the state championship is a hollow victory
in my opinion.

01:08:30.846 --> 01:08:34.112
Monday at 7:30.

01:08:35.218 --> 01:08:39.688
I can not force them to participate
of an unofficial game

01:08:39.689 --> 01:08:42.089
but if you have courage,

01:08:42.158 --> 01:08:44.598
will be here prepared.

01:08:50.433 --> 01:08:53.135
Get that idea out of his head.

01:08:53.136 --> 01:08:56.816
Do not worry.
I'll talk to him.

01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:07.201
See you Treats!

01:09:09.018 --> 01:09:10.652
There is the Pistol Pete.

01:09:10.653 --> 01:09:12.689
Go Treats in Soda Shop today?

01:09:12.689 --> 01:09:13.814
I do not know.

01:09:13.923 --> 01:09:15.323
Oh, come on...
What is the problem?

01:09:15.323 --> 01:09:18.094
Never celebrates with
team after the game.

01:09:18.095 --> 01:09:19.395
We want you to come.

01:09:19.397 --> 01:09:20.897
Come on, Pete.

01:09:20.916 --> 01:09:22.363
All right, then.

01:09:22.365 --> 01:09:25.425
Cool!
The first dance is mine.

01:09:27.303 --> 01:09:28.403
Then I realized.

01:09:28.404 --> 01:09:30.538
It was socially maladjusted.

01:09:30.540 --> 01:09:32.640
Put me on a basketball court

01:09:32.642 --> 01:09:35.578
with hundreds of people
and am very sociable,

01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:38.247
but the track
dance Treats

01:09:38.247 --> 01:09:41.183
with Sandy, the
Buddy girlfriend?

01:09:41.184 --> 01:09:42.786
He was already mad at me

01:09:42.787 --> 01:09:44.319
to attract the attention of everyone.

01:09:44.319 --> 01:09:47.256
It got worse because my father
convinced the technical Pendleton

01:09:47.258 --> 01:09:49.090
playing against the black team.

01:09:49.091 --> 01:09:51.911
But dance with his girlfriend...

01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:55.051
was when I started to sweat.

01:10:00.570 --> 01:10:01.970
Drew attention from me

01:10:01.971 --> 01:10:03.271
And gave it to a boy
eighth grade.

01:10:03.272 --> 01:10:05.675
Now it's my turn to
draw attention away from you.

01:10:05.676 --> 01:10:07.878
Will be no
game against blacks.

01:10:07.879 --> 01:10:10.162
Do not raise your hand
to his father, boy,

01:10:10.163 --> 01:10:13.215
still want to know who runs this family?

01:10:13.216 --> 01:10:15.184
Of course, only played against senior
,

01:10:15.185 --> 01:10:19.005
but never had a
Pete Maravich on the team.

01:10:20.623 --> 01:10:24.753
A boy so only
appears once in a lifetime.

01:10:25.294 --> 01:10:29.264
You can not imagine how I wanted it
you were that boy.

01:10:29.265 --> 01:10:31.565
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

01:10:32.268 --> 01:10:33.737
But be aware that there will be no
game,

01:10:33.738 --> 01:10:36.698
Because I will not let it happen
!

01:10:56.058 --> 01:10:58.388
What are you doing here?

01:10:59.362 --> 01:11:01.398
I thought I was in Treats.

01:11:01.399 --> 01:11:02.490
I will not.

01:11:03.266 --> 01:11:05.701
Honey, I heard the girls.

01:11:05.702 --> 01:11:08.068
They want you to go.

01:11:08.671 --> 01:11:10.551
No big deal.

01:11:10.907 --> 01:11:12.106
How so?

01:11:12.141 --> 01:11:14.121
There are a lot of crazy girls

01:11:14.122 --> 01:11:16.732
to dance with Pistol Pete.

01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:20.120
What's the matter, dear?

01:11:22.084 --> 01:11:23.514
Do not tell me...

01:11:24.553 --> 01:11:27.322
you fled classes
dance I paid?

01:11:27.323 --> 01:11:29.024
It was a waste of time.

01:11:29.025 --> 01:11:31.593
Had to practice with Dad.

01:11:31.594 --> 01:11:33.323
True, Press?

01:11:33.429 --> 01:11:35.099
What is truth?

01:11:35.231 --> 01:11:37.324
Talk to you later.

01:11:38.301 --> 01:11:42.203
Pete, let's take a quick course
.

01:11:56.152 --> 01:12:01.021
Relax. Feel the rhythm
. See?

01:12:01.691 --> 01:12:03.226
We can dance music

01:12:03.227 --> 01:12:04.626
this century, at least?

01:12:04.627 --> 01:12:09.737
If you can dance it,
will dance anything.

01:12:10.399 --> 01:12:12.332
When a slow song,

01:12:12.333 --> 01:12:15.103
pull the girl close, as well.

01:12:15.104 --> 01:12:16.573
Wonderful things can happen

01:12:16.574 --> 01:12:18.944
when you are dancing.

01:12:19.608 --> 01:12:20.658
My turn.

01:12:25.581 --> 01:12:27.517
The first time I left
with this beautiful woman,

01:12:27.518 --> 01:12:30.151
the band of Glenn Miller was playing

01:12:30.152 --> 01:12:35.249
And during the first song,
I asked her to marry.

01:12:38.995 --> 01:12:41.696
So, you want me to take you to
Treats?

01:12:41.697 --> 01:12:45.837
Will not disappoint all those girls
, are you?

01:12:48.004 --> 01:12:49.096
No

01:13:24.206 --> 01:13:25.607
Sandy was right.

01:13:25.608 --> 01:13:28.176
I've never been to parties
after the game.

01:13:28.177 --> 01:13:30.078
It would be shocked if he found

01:13:30.079 --> 01:13:32.147
I started going
when she called me.

01:13:32.148 --> 01:13:33.798
I wondered if these boys

01:13:33.799 --> 01:13:35.683
really wanted me to be.

01:13:35.684 --> 01:13:38.219
They received me well when I arrived.

01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:39.387
It was great.

01:13:39.422 --> 01:13:42.123
Moose and the guys
greeted me.

01:13:42.124 --> 01:13:43.591
But where was Sandy?

01:13:43.592 --> 01:13:47.172
I was afraid of being cheated
on it.

01:13:49.098 --> 01:13:50.233
Would you care to dance with

01:13:50.234 --> 01:13:52.067
someone from another class?

01:13:52.068 --> 01:13:53.598
But what Buddy?

01:13:53.669 --> 01:13:55.070
Do not worry about it.

01:13:55.071 --> 01:13:56.971
I like this music, come on.

01:13:56.972 --> 01:13:58.673
She really liked me.

01:13:58.674 --> 01:14:00.375
I could not believe.

01:14:00.376 --> 01:14:02.746
<i>Tonight would be perfect</i>

01:14:03.913 --> 01:14:04.641
More?

01:14:07.383 --> 01:14:10.218
Known that the Pistol
had 21 points and 10 passes.

01:14:10.219 --> 01:14:13.814
From star to drunk
in just one night.

01:14:15.357 --> 01:14:16.925
Can fill,
"Can Head".

01:14:16.926 --> 01:14:20.606
Walk, the boy will be famous
one day.

01:14:20.663 --> 01:14:24.173
Moose, the runt
needs a lesson.

01:14:30.372 --> 01:14:33.502
What are you looking,
four eyes?

01:14:47.623 --> 01:14:49.424
Stay away from my girl
, Petey.

01:14:49.425 --> 01:14:51.027
Buddy, we're just dancing
.

01:14:51.028 --> 01:14:52.127
Grow up, Sandy.

01:14:52.128 --> 01:14:54.097
Come near my girl
, have to pay.

01:14:54.098 --> 01:14:55.223
You drank.

01:14:55.297 --> 01:14:57.165
Come here, you worm.

01:14:57.166 --> 01:15:00.603
Thought you had done all the bullshit
,

01:15:00.604 --> 01:15:02.372
but you and your father
want to make people play

01:15:02.373 --> 01:15:03.471
with a bunch of savages

01:15:03.472 --> 01:15:06.292
a league that does not exist!

01:15:06.609 --> 01:15:08.511
Will not have any
game, Maravich.

01:15:08.512 --> 01:15:10.013
I will not let happen.

01:15:10.014 --> 01:15:10.912
Why not?

01:15:10.913 --> 01:15:14.015
It is best to close the nozzle, Petey Boy

01:15:14.016 --> 01:15:15.847
Okay, let's vote.

01:15:16.352 --> 01:15:19.482
Who wants to play
against blacks?

01:15:20.089 --> 01:15:21.389
What is the matter with you?

01:15:21.390 --> 01:15:23.625
They want Cleveland
come to our school?

01:15:23.626 --> 01:15:25.196
No way.

01:15:25.261 --> 01:15:26.928
This is your answer, dizzy.

01:15:26.929 --> 01:15:29.063
Your father will take
the same thing.

01:15:29.064 --> 01:15:30.266
You are a joke
in this city.

01:15:30.267 --> 01:15:31.681
His father and you belong to a

01:15:31.682 --> 01:15:34.082
circus freaks show.

01:15:35.204 --> 01:15:38.194
You think you're a great player
.

01:15:38.908 --> 01:15:40.208
But it's a comedy.

01:15:40.209 --> 01:15:42.445
Scream "Pistol" to give
laugh of his tricks.

01:15:42.446 --> 01:15:46.056
That's it.
I should break your face.

01:15:46.315 --> 01:15:47.435
I'm leaving.

01:15:50.619 --> 01:15:52.420
Let's personal, let's go.

01:15:52.421 --> 01:15:54.324
Prejudice and
Buddy selfishness

01:15:54.325 --> 01:15:56.555
had gone too far.

01:15:58.928 --> 01:15:59.917
Moose.

01:16:06.135 --> 01:16:07.969
Knew that if I said anything
,

01:16:07.970 --> 01:16:11.973
Buddy would make me understand the meaning of
"Iron Time".

01:16:11.974 --> 01:16:14.377
But I decided I needed to defend myself,

01:16:14.378 --> 01:16:17.141
at any cost.

01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:19.570
Hard head!

01:16:25.087 --> 01:16:26.377
What was that?

01:16:26.922 --> 01:16:30.085
You heard me. It is what it is.

01:16:30.659 --> 01:16:32.427
Always thinking in yourself,

01:16:32.428 --> 01:16:35.063
and instead of thinking about
team or Sandy.

01:16:35.064 --> 01:16:36.431
Is that what you think?

01:16:36.432 --> 01:16:38.032
That's what I know.

01:16:38.434 --> 01:16:39.634
If you are a big deal,

01:16:39.635 --> 01:16:42.370
why we
does not take the test?

01:16:42.371 --> 01:16:45.141
If I win, we play
against Cleveland.

01:16:45.142 --> 01:16:46.307
What if I win?

01:16:46.308 --> 01:16:47.969
I leave the team.

01:16:48.310 --> 01:16:50.111
You think you're good?

01:16:50.112 --> 01:16:51.443
I know I am.

01:16:51.714 --> 01:16:53.449
Can be prepared,
because this time

01:16:53.450 --> 01:16:55.483
will be no tricks up his sleeve.

01:16:55.484 --> 01:16:59.754
You and I, alone in the gym
in 20 minutes.

01:17:01.190 --> 01:17:02.957
It was the moment of truth.

01:17:02.958 --> 01:17:05.928
Buddy made me look like a fool in front of Sandy

01:17:05.929 --> 01:17:08.296
while
broke his heart.

01:17:08.297 --> 01:17:09.597
Buddy was wrong.

01:17:09.598 --> 01:17:12.135
Dad and I were not a joke
, and I prove this...

01:17:12.136 --> 01:17:15.195
him, Sandy
and myself.

01:17:22.311 --> 01:17:23.912
Hey, Sprite, you can lead a

01:17:23.913 --> 01:17:26.663
basketball in the hall?

01:17:30.185 --> 01:17:33.288
For school Daniel High,
is poor basketball.

01:17:33.289 --> 01:17:35.408
Think of it during the weekend,

01:17:35.409 --> 01:17:37.458
and play basketball
how to,

01:17:37.459 --> 01:17:39.994
will be able to put the uniform of the team...

01:17:39.995 --> 01:17:42.955
if you can not,
forget it.

01:17:46.402 --> 01:17:48.137
If you're smart,
will give up.

01:17:48.138 --> 01:17:49.258
Today it.

01:17:52.441 --> 01:17:55.711
Your tricks will end soon, Pete.

01:17:57.946 --> 01:17:59.247
You are a joke.

01:17:59.248 --> 01:18:02.984
Scream "Pistol" to give
laugh of his tricks. That's all.

01:18:02.985 --> 01:18:05.385
Should break your face.

01:18:17.633 --> 01:18:18.823
Who starts?

01:18:20.235 --> 01:18:21.202
You

01:19:01.076 --> 01:19:02.477
But if you indulge in,

01:19:02.478 --> 01:19:05.444
and use this gift that God gave him
,

01:19:05.445 --> 01:19:08.815
will one day play in the first team
.

01:19:11.954 --> 01:19:14.540
That pain there in the soul of background

01:19:14.541 --> 01:19:17.601
encouraged me to be something better!

01:19:20.229 --> 01:19:23.065
I can train you up out of breath,
but while it does not feel something

01:19:23.066 --> 01:19:28.066
burning your soul, my
words are worthless.

01:19:36.512 --> 01:19:38.846
Think... a dream

01:19:38.881 --> 01:19:40.579
is nothing more than a challenge

01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:43.120
we put ourselves.

01:19:49.625 --> 01:19:51.058
That's it.

01:19:53.328 --> 01:19:55.329
See you Monday night.

01:19:55.330 --> 01:19:56.364
No, do not.

01:19:56.365 --> 01:19:57.965
We made a deal!

01:19:57.966 --> 01:19:59.368
That's when you screwed up, Pete.

01:19:59.369 --> 01:20:01.459
You believed in me.

01:20:01.537 --> 01:20:03.404
So why did you come?

01:20:03.405 --> 01:20:04.439
What do you think?

01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:06.674
Not want to destroy the diner,

01:20:06.675 --> 01:20:09.143
and I hate to ruin my
image in public.

01:20:09.144 --> 01:20:11.412
Especially when I break your face.

01:20:11.413 --> 01:20:12.533
No, Buddy.

01:20:13.615 --> 01:20:15.516
Hey, what are you doing here?

01:20:15.517 --> 01:20:17.051
This has nothing to do with you
.

01:20:17.052 --> 01:20:18.688
Is between Maravich and me.

01:20:18.689 --> 01:20:19.643
I.

01:20:20.923 --> 01:20:22.625
"Metal Head"
do not tell me

01:20:22.626 --> 01:20:24.358
you will try to stop me!

01:20:24.359 --> 01:20:26.384
It is I who will.

01:20:28.263 --> 01:20:30.283
Made a deal, Buddy.

01:20:30.399 --> 01:20:31.969
The Pistol won.

01:20:33.502 --> 01:20:35.872
Are you serious?

01:20:46.582 --> 01:20:48.052
We talked.

01:20:48.250 --> 01:20:51.152
And we play with
the black team.

01:20:51.153 --> 01:20:54.388
Let's find out if we are really good...

01:20:54.389 --> 01:20:56.516
with or without you.

01:20:59.261 --> 01:21:02.461
Now Walk, this
means nothing.

01:21:03.098 --> 01:21:05.399
We can not play with those guys.

01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:07.730
Monday. At 19:30.

01:21:09.104 --> 01:21:13.174
If we discover what we really are.

01:21:13.208 --> 01:21:14.175
Let.

01:21:24.152 --> 01:21:27.688
I thought of some things
sitting there a few minutes ago.

01:21:27.689 --> 01:21:28.883
Thought?

01:21:30.893 --> 01:21:33.813
See you make me wanna dream
.

01:21:34.062 --> 01:21:36.392
Dream to be an actress?

01:21:37.032 --> 01:21:38.532
Dream at all.

01:21:39.034 --> 01:21:41.334
Take care, Marilyn Monroe.

01:21:43.372 --> 01:21:46.240
Pete, and the Cleveland
beat us?

01:21:46.241 --> 01:21:47.741
There are going to win.

01:21:48.443 --> 01:21:50.244
But what if they win?

01:21:50.245 --> 01:21:53.114
So we can say we tried.

01:21:53.115 --> 01:21:57.315
Let's put on a show that
they will not forget.

01:21:57.486 --> 01:22:00.096
Pete, you are special even.

01:22:02.024 --> 01:22:03.626
I felt a shiver the crown

01:22:03.627 --> 01:22:05.677
to the tips of Ps.

01:22:06.161 --> 01:22:08.158
Knew it was a friendly kiss
,

01:22:08.159 --> 01:22:10.498
but I could not help but want

01:22:10.499 --> 01:22:12.829
be a little older.

01:22:12.935 --> 01:22:15.004
Well, at least
Sandy and I could

01:22:15.005 --> 01:22:17.345
share our dreams.

01:22:19.541 --> 01:22:22.327
You know, Pete, when I was in college
,

01:22:22.328 --> 01:22:26.581
was called 'Man
Point Per Minute'.

01:22:26.582 --> 01:22:28.649
Many felt that I could not

01:22:28.650 --> 01:22:33.644
scoring 36 points per game, but they...

01:22:35.157 --> 01:22:38.047
they were stuck in the past.

01:22:41.563 --> 01:22:45.566
To my knowledge, no
white team

01:22:45.601 --> 01:22:47.403
've played with a team of blacks in this region

01:22:47.404 --> 01:22:50.339
so perhaps
just me and her mother

01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:52.610
're in the stands.

01:22:53.342 --> 01:22:56.232
Mom makes enough noise.

01:22:56.445 --> 01:23:00.265
I will not disagree with you
about it.

01:23:01.650 --> 01:23:04.251
Your dreams with some basketball

01:23:04.252 --> 01:23:06.622
times let you discouraged?

01:23:09.324 --> 01:23:10.291
They leave.

01:23:12.094 --> 01:23:13.524
Do you know why?

01:23:16.331 --> 01:23:17.691
I think so.

01:23:19.401 --> 01:23:21.661
So why do it?

01:23:24.973 --> 01:23:27.508
If you can create a magical moment
/

01:23:27.509 --> 01:23:30.112
if you can show
fans something they have never seen,

01:23:30.113 --> 01:23:31.580
they will return often,

01:23:31.581 --> 01:23:33.671
either win or lose.

01:23:34.249 --> 01:23:35.685
's Up to you to take them to a place

01:23:35.686 --> 01:23:38.085
they've never been before.

01:23:38.086 --> 01:23:41.316
Give them a
little hope.

01:23:42.958 --> 01:23:45.077
I think you discouraged when

01:23:45.078 --> 01:23:47.053
realize that half the people

01:23:47.054 --> 01:23:49.944
who see
never understand.

01:23:51.033 --> 01:23:53.534
They call me sausage.

01:23:53.535 --> 01:23:56.425
But they are always there, waiting

01:23:56.505 --> 01:23:58.632
I give a show.

01:24:00.509 --> 01:24:02.319
So give a show.

01:24:03.111 --> 01:24:08.001
Sometimes, just want to stop,
and be like everyone else.

01:24:11.153 --> 01:24:15.589
This is a choice only you can make
, Pete.

01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:17.750
But if it were me...

01:24:18.326 --> 01:24:22.566
Them give a show to remember
forever.

01:24:24.566 --> 01:24:30.436
But in any
is, love you, Pete.

01:24:35.711 --> 01:24:37.901
I will always love you.

01:24:46.388 --> 01:24:48.489
We have to understand

01:24:48.490 --> 01:24:50.858
the Cleveland
plays different

01:24:50.859 --> 01:24:54.059
at all times we face.

01:24:54.329 --> 01:24:58.629
They run at full speed
until the final whistle.

01:24:59.301 --> 01:25:02.204
It has three guys with an average

01:25:02.239 --> 01:25:04.429
22 points per game.

01:25:05.674 --> 01:25:08.541
All dart.
They all run.

01:25:09.578 --> 01:25:11.068
Everyone plays.

01:25:13.648 --> 01:25:14.950
Equally proud of their

01:25:14.951 --> 01:25:17.151
48 consecutive victories.

01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:21.978
Remember that without Buddy,

01:25:22.190 --> 01:25:25.921
can not have many faults.

01:25:28.296 --> 01:25:29.263
Carl.

01:25:34.202 --> 01:25:37.266
Lord, You said all

01:25:37.301 --> 01:25:40.501
is possible for you... Help us.

01:25:40.609 --> 01:25:41.598
Thank you.

01:25:46.047 --> 01:25:48.682
Okay, people,
without mercy!

01:25:48.683 --> 01:25:50.252
One, two, three...

01:25:50.253 --> 01:25:51.185
LIONS!

01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:00.296
Pete, I gave you some freedom
,

01:26:00.297 --> 01:26:02.907
and we won some games.

01:26:03.031 --> 01:26:06.534
We will not win them
playing as them.

01:26:06.535 --> 01:26:11.055
Let's make them the only way we know...

01:26:14.910 --> 01:26:18.600
muscle and fundamentals of basketball, right?

01:26:19.014 --> 01:26:20.106
Right.

01:26:41.903 --> 01:26:43.443
At dawn...

01:26:50.912 --> 01:26:54.006
Basic! Basic basketball!

01:27:10.298 --> 01:27:11.993
Defense, people!

01:27:26.982 --> 01:27:28.183
Do not worry about the outcome,

01:27:28.184 --> 01:27:29.149
are going well.

01:27:29.150 --> 01:27:30.419
Technical, they are
killing us.

01:27:30.420 --> 01:27:32.466
Keep  Basic.

01:27:32.501 --> 01:27:34.513
Caprichem defense.

01:27:36.091 --> 01:27:38.561
Come on, ending up with them!

01:27:56.244 --> 01:27:58.371
It's show time, Pete!

01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:01.090
Make your move. Do it now!

01:28:12.294 --> 01:28:15.254
Decrease.
And works the ball.

01:28:26.041 --> 01:28:27.921
Helen, I'll be right back.

01:28:28.109 --> 01:28:29.476
In the middle of the game?

01:28:29.477 --> 01:28:31.427
You can scream for me.

01:28:31.913 --> 01:28:33.107
Bring popcorn!

01:28:56.538 --> 01:28:59.239
You're looking at the future Buddy.

01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:02.450
Amazing pitches,
great base.

01:29:03.378 --> 01:29:08.448
Pete and some of these boys
are twenty years ahead.

01:29:08.583 --> 01:29:10.813
You have talent, son.

01:29:11.519 --> 01:29:15.059
Or you enter the
boat or will be.

01:29:39.047 --> 01:29:42.649
Walk... Forgot how
make a light trap?

01:29:42.650 --> 01:29:50.860
Pete marker is on him like a Siamese twin
, he will not get your help?

01:29:56.598 --> 01:29:58.198
What's wrong with you?

01:29:58.199 --> 01:30:00.100
They act as if they could not
earn them.

01:30:00.101 --> 01:30:02.401
We can beat them.

01:30:03.671 --> 01:30:07.074
I think I was
wrong with this team.

01:30:07.075 --> 01:30:09.965
I thought you had passion.

01:30:14.282 --> 01:30:16.372
Can I say something?

01:30:20.121 --> 01:30:23.321
I have to ask apologize to you.

01:30:23.625 --> 01:30:24.691
I was a fool this year

01:30:24.692 --> 01:30:27.388
and say, I'm sorry.

01:30:30.365 --> 01:30:32.499
This team means everything to me,

01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:35.530
although I like selfish /

01:30:36.571 --> 01:30:38.211
well, I was selfish.

01:30:39.641 --> 01:30:41.700
Father, just want to play.

01:30:45.447 --> 01:30:48.439
Okay. Get dressed,

01:30:49.651 --> 01:30:51.811
Come on, we will win!

01:30:59.127 --> 01:31:00.807
No hard feelings?

01:31:01.396 --> 01:31:03.076
No hard feelings.

01:31:03.264 --> 01:31:07.634
Why would we win, we will have to work together
.

01:31:07.635 --> 01:31:08.932
Hey, Buddy.

01:31:09.137 --> 01:31:09.969
What?

01:31:10.004 --> 01:31:13.507
I still think you
is a hard head.

01:31:13.508 --> 01:31:14.558
I also.

01:31:21.382 --> 01:31:23.085
Okay, where
is the first team?

01:31:23.086 --> 01:31:27.044
CD, Moose, Vick, Pete...

01:31:28.123 --> 01:31:30.423
I know coach Walker out.

01:31:31.626 --> 01:31:33.360
That's it.
We earn them. Come on.

01:31:33.361 --> 01:31:35.451
One, two, three, Lions!

01:31:37.632 --> 01:31:39.293
Two, two!

01:31:43.171 --> 01:31:45.021
Keep track!

01:31:49.410 --> 01:31:52.902
Now I see!
Pistol, Pistol!

01:32:30.151 --> 01:32:32.244
Pete! Calm!

01:32:41.729 --> 01:32:43.931
This boy! That's it!

01:32:43.932 --> 01:32:45.402
Defense, folks!

01:32:54.976 --> 01:32:56.786
Not so bad.

01:32:57.579 --> 01:32:59.389
Well, if it works out.

01:33:01.482 --> 01:33:03.918
Defense, defense, defense.

01:33:03.953 --> 01:33:06.087
Defense, defense

01:33:06.122 --> 01:33:07.315
Defense.

01:33:14.662 --> 01:33:16.512
Time, time, time.

01:33:21.236 --> 01:33:23.403
Okay, everyone here!

01:33:23.404 --> 01:33:25.239
We have time
to a pitch.

01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:26.573
Pete, you made me believe.

01:33:26.574 --> 01:33:28.143
We will see a bit of its magic.

01:33:28.144 --> 01:33:30.164
One, Two, Three Lions!

01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:40.320
Come on, boys!

01:34:00.742 --> 01:34:07.443
We won!

01:34:08.216 --> 01:34:13.068
Daniel Lions! We won!

01:34:13.103 --> 01:34:17.920
No point,
was not the point!

01:34:18.359 --> 01:34:20.424
As well, was not the point?

01:34:20.425 --> 01:34:23.245
The weather still was running.

01:34:23.531 --> 01:34:24.933
The last time I was stolen,

01:34:24.934 --> 01:34:26.333
they wore a mask!

01:34:26.334 --> 01:34:28.115
We won them and you know it.

01:34:28.116 --> 01:34:30.586
Still have the best team.

01:34:32.173 --> 01:34:33.813
For the locker room!

01:34:49.590 --> 01:35:00.296
Pistol, Pistol, Pistol...

01:35:01.602 --> 01:35:05.238
Words can not express how I felt
.

01:35:05.239 --> 01:35:08.229
It was now heir of a Dream /

01:35:08.276 --> 01:35:11.476
a dream that came true
.

01:35:12.146 --> 01:35:13.926
Dad was right.

01:35:14.482 --> 01:35:18.085
The fans wanted to live
a magical moment...

01:35:18.086 --> 01:35:21.852
One moment
could fly high,

01:35:22.490 --> 01:35:25.959
they could believe that anything was possible.

01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:29.623
Win or winning, they would come

01:35:29.964 --> 01:35:33.233
game after game to see
a boy of loose socks

01:35:33.234 --> 01:35:35.566
known as Pistol.

01:35:36.904 --> 01:35:39.139
Press Maravich gave his son
a great gift of love:

01:35:39.140 --> 01:35:41.975
A life dedicated to see the dreams
your child come true.

01:35:41.976 --> 01:35:44.544
