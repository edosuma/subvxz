[Episode 15: At Yu-mi's House]

00:53.280 --> 00:55.400
[Hello to everyone in Woong's village.]

00:55.600 --> 00:56.960
[Did everyone sleep well?]

00:57.040 --> 00:59.520
This morning, I'm reminded of this phrase.

00:59.880 --> 01:03.520
"Happiness always comes with hardships."

01:03.840 --> 01:05.360
That's how it was like yesterday.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.920
Did you have to pick the necklace
with Sae-yi?

01:09.000 --> 01:11.720
Why didn't you say Sae-yi gave you
that yuzu preserve?

01:13.080 --> 01:14.160
I'm hanging up.

01:14.400 --> 01:16.720
Enjoy dongdongju and sleep well.

01:16.800 --> 01:19.760
Wait. Hello? Hello?

01:25.280 --> 01:28.520
[It was the first time
we saw Yu-mi get mad.]

01:37.640 --> 01:38.880
Can you give me that one?

01:44.280 --> 01:45.600
[We were scared]

01:45.920 --> 01:48.800
[that Yu-mi's birthday would be
the last day they were together.]

01:51.600 --> 01:54.720
[It took a lot of courage
to go to her house.]

01:55.800 --> 01:57.120
[But...]

02:05.760 --> 02:06.880
It's Yu-mi!

02:06.960 --> 02:09.560
What should we do?
What if Yu-mi wants to break up?

02:12.600 --> 02:13.880
Is that all?

02:14.600 --> 02:16.800
-Yes.
-Do you think that explains everything?

02:18.360 --> 02:19.720
Because that's all.

02:25.920 --> 02:28.320
She smiled. Yu-mi smiled.

02:28.400 --> 02:30.880
What's this? Is this not the end?

02:39.040 --> 02:41.480
Let's go up. Let's eat together.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.040
Things are okay!

02:54.120 --> 02:55.680
She told him to come up!

02:55.760 --> 02:59.200
We're going into Yu-mi's house!

02:59.280 --> 03:02.760
Right. Happiness doesn't come alone.

03:03.800 --> 03:07.320
It always comes with hardships!

03:08.560 --> 03:10.960
Beat the drums!

03:11.560 --> 03:13.960
Now, all that's left is to be happy!

03:36.480 --> 03:38.720
-This is my place.
-I see.

03:50.800 --> 03:53.280
Guys! We need to calm down.

03:53.360 --> 03:55.960
What should he do first?

03:56.120 --> 03:57.920
How about he gives her a hug from behind?

03:58.000 --> 03:59.040
A hug from behind?

03:59.120 --> 04:01.760
Oh, that sounds nice! It's great timing!

04:02.440 --> 04:03.560
Do you like it too?

04:06.800 --> 04:08.440
-Come in, Woong.
-Okay.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.280
What's that? Heart, stop for a second.

04:23.640 --> 04:26.600
[Mic test.]

04:26.680 --> 04:27.960
[Can you hear me?]

04:28.040 --> 04:29.960
-Isn't that Intestine cell's voice?
[-Mic test.]

04:30.160 --> 04:32.760
This is the large intestine.

04:33.280 --> 04:35.360
I'd like to let the entire village know.

04:35.440 --> 04:37.400
Woong has a stomachache,

04:37.480 --> 04:40.640
so we will soon release that thing
from Woong's stomach.

04:40.720 --> 04:42.320
Do they hear me?

04:44.120 --> 04:45.240
I need to poop!

04:46.400 --> 04:49.480
What are you talking about?
You want to release poop at this moment?

04:49.560 --> 04:51.760
Intestine cell, have you lost your mind?

04:54.760 --> 04:56.600
[Yes, that's right.]

04:57.240 --> 05:00.680
[Happiness always comes with hardships.]

05:01.760 --> 05:04.400
[I guess it doesn't come for free.]

05:12.600 --> 05:14.840
[Diary]

05:19.880 --> 05:21.600
Okay. I cleaned everything up,

05:21.920 --> 05:24.160
and the air is cool. Good.

05:24.520 --> 05:25.520
Woong.

05:26.920 --> 05:28.240
Darn it.

05:29.040 --> 05:30.160
[Woong, what are you doing?]

05:32.280 --> 05:33.640
Why isn't he coming in?

05:37.680 --> 05:38.800
What were you doing?

05:39.400 --> 05:40.440
What?

05:43.200 --> 05:44.280
Come in.

05:46.040 --> 05:48.960
[We decided to face the hardship head-on]

05:49.440 --> 05:51.880
[because we might not get
another chance to come to Yu-mi's house.]

05:52.920 --> 05:53.960
[However...]

05:54.560 --> 05:56.040
My place is a bit small, isn't it?

05:56.400 --> 05:59.320
It's nice and cozy.

06:00.520 --> 06:01.840
Let's have some cake first.

06:02.240 --> 06:04.120
Okay, let's do that.

06:08.640 --> 06:10.560
Gosh, it's so pretty.

06:11.280 --> 06:13.040
I really love strawberry cheesecake.

06:18.360 --> 06:19.800
Woong, what are you doing?

06:20.600 --> 06:22.640
-What?
-Come here. Let's light the candles.

06:23.920 --> 06:24.960
Okay.

06:50.920 --> 06:52.280
Should we turn off the lights?

06:54.040 --> 06:56.720
-Sure.
-Woong, the switch is over there.

07:15.120 --> 07:17.200
[Emergency.]

07:17.440 --> 07:20.160
[The large intestine is about to release
that thing.]

07:21.360 --> 07:22.480
No!

07:23.960 --> 07:26.080
This is his first day visiting
his girlfriend's house!

07:26.160 --> 07:28.360
Do whatever you can to hold it in!

07:29.680 --> 07:32.840
[Can you hold it in?]

07:30.400 --> 07:31.960
[Can you hold it in?]

07:32.920 --> 07:34.520
[No.]

07:34.600 --> 07:36.240
[Not even one minute?]

07:34.800 --> 07:36.720
[Not even one minute?]

07:36.320 --> 07:37.760
[Yes.]

07:37.840 --> 07:41.680
[Run into the bathroom right now.]

07:38.760 --> 07:41.200
[Run into the bathroom right now.]

07:41.840 --> 07:44.320
Darn it. Is there anything else we can do?

07:44.400 --> 07:45.520
[There is one thing.]

07:45.600 --> 07:46.960
What is it?

07:48.280 --> 07:49.720
[Searching]

07:49.760 --> 07:51.360
[He can poop in his pants.]

07:56.720 --> 07:59.840
Woong. You should sing the song for me.

08:02.200 --> 08:03.200
Woong.

08:05.040 --> 08:06.080
The song.

08:06.160 --> 08:07.280
What?

08:07.560 --> 08:09.440
Aren't you going to sing
the birthday song for me?

08:10.360 --> 08:12.360
Right. I will.

08:13.600 --> 08:14.600
The song...

08:25.960 --> 08:29.480
-♫ Happy birthday to you ♫
-♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

08:29.960 --> 08:33.440
-♫ Happy birthday to you ♫
-♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

08:33.640 --> 08:36.440
-♫ Happy birthday dear Yu-mi ♫
-♫ Happy birthday dear... ♫

08:37.799 --> 08:38.880
Bathroom.

08:39.760 --> 08:42.039
-What?
-Where's your bathroom?

08:42.720 --> 08:44.480
-What?
-Where's your bathroom?

08:45.000 --> 08:46.640
The bathroom is over there.

08:52.720 --> 08:55.360
-The door isn't opening, Yu-mi.
-You have to push it. Push it, Woong!

08:55.440 --> 08:56.480
Push?

09:00.920 --> 09:02.320
Oh, no.

09:04.440 --> 09:06.360
[Flushing]

09:06.560 --> 09:09.640
[Mission clear.
We have released that thing.]

09:06.640 --> 09:09.520
[Clear]

09:10.400 --> 09:12.440
It's all over. We're doomed.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.880
I can't believe he pooped
on his first visit

09:14.760 --> 09:16.760
[Clear]

09:14.960 --> 09:16.640
to his girlfriend's house.

09:17.960 --> 09:19.080
I'm so embarrassed.

09:22.240 --> 09:24.440
Was there something wrong
with the pasta I had earlier?

09:25.280 --> 09:26.640
Why did I suddenly get a stomachache?

09:30.480 --> 09:32.680
-Woong.
-Yes?

09:33.160 --> 09:35.960
Are you feeling sick?
Do you have a stomachache?

09:36.800 --> 09:38.080
No, I'm fine.

09:47.960 --> 09:50.960
Should I blow out the candles?
They're melting.

09:53.080 --> 09:54.160
No.

09:54.640 --> 09:56.640
Wait a second. I'll be right out.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.160
Okay.

10:07.280 --> 10:08.640
Love.

10:08.720 --> 10:11.120
Let's forget about the things
that already happened.

10:11.280 --> 10:14.560
I'm sure Yu-mi will understand.

10:14.640 --> 10:17.880
You're right. We can always start again.

10:17.960 --> 10:19.320
What should we do next?

10:20.000 --> 10:23.640
When Yu-mi blows out the candles, let's
set the mood with a celebratory kiss!

10:23.720 --> 10:25.560
What do you think?
It's a good idea, right?

10:25.960 --> 10:27.640
A celebratory kiss sounds good!

10:30.840 --> 10:33.240
What is it? What's wrong this time?

10:47.880 --> 10:51.440
[We shouldn't have face the hardship]

10:51.520 --> 10:53.480
[and just gone home.]

10:53.560 --> 10:54.560
No.

10:55.520 --> 10:56.840
Don't do this to me.

11:02.800 --> 11:05.120
[Is the toilet clogged?]

11:03.160 --> 11:04.840
[Is the toilet clogged?]

11:05.200 --> 11:06.360
[Yes.]

11:06.440 --> 11:08.120
[Do you need a tool?]

11:06.760 --> 11:08.240
[Do you need a tool?]

11:08.200 --> 11:09.040
[Yes.]

11:17.440 --> 11:21.080
[Unsuitable]

11:17.920 --> 11:18.920
[Unsuitable.]

11:21.160 --> 11:26.160
[Ask Yu-mi for help.]

11:22.080 --> 11:24.160
[Ask Yu-mi for help.]

11:26.800 --> 11:27.840
No.

11:30.200 --> 11:31.280
I can't do that.

11:33.200 --> 11:34.480
This won't do.

11:46.200 --> 11:47.840
Why isn't he coming out?

11:49.280 --> 11:50.560
Is he taking a shower?

11:53.400 --> 11:54.440
A shower?

11:59.520 --> 12:00.920
Why?

12:10.040 --> 12:11.360
Woong.

12:12.360 --> 12:14.480
I was wondering
what was taking you so long.

12:14.960 --> 12:15.960
Right.

12:16.440 --> 12:18.840
Well... Yu-mi.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.640
Yes? What is it?

12:22.240 --> 12:24.200
Do you have...

12:24.280 --> 12:25.320
Yes?

12:26.880 --> 12:28.320
Do you have that at home?

12:29.360 --> 12:30.400
"That"?

12:30.800 --> 12:33.760
I need that.

12:34.680 --> 12:36.280
What is "that"?

12:37.600 --> 12:39.200
You know...

12:41.120 --> 12:43.560
If you don't have one,
I was going to go out and buy it.

12:48.480 --> 12:49.640
Oh, that...

12:50.640 --> 12:51.680
Do you have one?

12:53.200 --> 12:54.320
I don't.

12:55.040 --> 12:56.280
You don't?

12:58.520 --> 13:00.720
You don't have a plunger for the toilet?

13:01.640 --> 13:03.320
- What?
- It's a bit clogged,

13:03.400 --> 13:04.920
so I need one.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.120
Oh, the toilet.

13:08.680 --> 13:10.280
The toilet got clogged?

13:10.360 --> 13:11.400
A little.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.640
- I have it.
- You do?

13:21.280 --> 13:23.080
I was wondering what "that" was.

13:28.440 --> 13:29.480
Woong.

13:34.400 --> 13:35.400
Here.

13:36.080 --> 13:37.160
Thanks.

13:37.560 --> 13:39.960
But shouldn't I do it?

13:40.040 --> 13:41.360
I've done it a lot.

13:41.440 --> 13:44.600
No. Thanks, but no thanks.

13:44.960 --> 13:46.640
I'll take care of what's mine.

13:56.280 --> 13:57.280
Goodness.

14:07.920 --> 14:09.240
What an embarrassment!

14:13.240 --> 14:14.280
Did I get it?

14:24.480 --> 14:25.840
Oh, no! I'm in trouble!

14:26.360 --> 14:28.280
-Woong.
-Yes?

14:29.120 --> 14:30.360
What's wrong? Is it not working?

14:31.800 --> 14:32.840
No.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.040
I'll be out soon. Wait a second.

14:35.160 --> 14:37.160
I'll do it. Open the door.

14:37.840 --> 14:39.280
I said, I'm almost done.

14:41.160 --> 14:42.760
Go ahead and have some cake.

14:47.920 --> 14:49.760
He should've just gone home.

14:50.280 --> 14:55.440
He should've gone home as soon as
his stomach started hurting.

14:56.320 --> 14:58.520
-Hello?
[-Yes, hello?]

14:58.600 --> 15:00.080
Hey, Intestine cell!

15:00.160 --> 15:02.080
Hey, Reason. I'm sorry,

15:02.160 --> 15:05.600
but I called because we need to
release that again.

15:05.680 --> 15:08.280
What? Have you really lost your mind?

15:08.360 --> 15:11.120
You're a complete lunatic!
Do you have any idea where we are?

15:11.200 --> 15:13.560
We're not at home. We're at Yu-mi's place!

15:13.640 --> 15:15.960
But there's nothing I can do about it.

15:16.040 --> 15:19.800
As you know,
this is an automatic discharge system.

15:19.880 --> 15:22.240
I think there was a problem
with the cream pasta he ate.

15:22.320 --> 15:25.560
Hey! The toilet is clogged!

15:25.640 --> 15:27.960
You want him to poop in a clogged toilet?

15:28.040 --> 15:30.520
Why are you getting so mad?

15:31.200 --> 15:33.120
My gosh.

15:35.320 --> 15:36.400
My stomach.

15:38.680 --> 15:41.840
Is this for real?
At my girlfriend's house?

15:43.040 --> 15:45.560
My gosh. This is driving me crazy.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.160
Why won't it unclog?

16:20.040 --> 16:21.920
Woong, are you okay?

16:22.320 --> 16:23.360
Yes.

16:24.080 --> 16:25.320
I unclogged everything,

16:26.200 --> 16:28.080
and I cleaned it up nicely too.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.880
You didn't have to clean.

16:33.040 --> 16:34.080
I'm sorry

16:35.040 --> 16:36.240
about this.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.080
Right.

16:40.320 --> 16:41.320
What about the cake?

16:41.400 --> 16:43.920
I put it in the refrigerator
since it took you so long.

16:44.120 --> 16:45.680
-Do you want some?
-No.

16:46.400 --> 16:47.480
It's okay.

16:49.080 --> 16:51.640
I think I got a stomachache
from the cream pasta.

16:52.840 --> 16:56.040
Yu-mi. I think I should go.

16:56.120 --> 16:57.600
Shouldn't you go see a doctor?

Okay.

Apparently it's good for stomachaches.

17:07.720 --> 17:10.280
It's okay. I should just get home.

17:10.359 --> 17:11.880
You should go when you feel a bit better.

17:11.960 --> 17:13.680
What if your stomach hurts
on your way home?

17:19.720 --> 17:21.359
Gosh. What can you do?

17:21.440 --> 17:24.520
He can just poop in his pants.
What does it matter?

17:24.880 --> 17:26.599
Everything is already messed up.

17:30.040 --> 17:32.760
No, I'll take care of it.

I'll just go home--

17:36.040 --> 17:37.080
Come here.

17:38.520 --> 17:40.960
Lay here. I turned on the heating pad.

18:17.320 --> 18:18.360
Rub my belly?

18:25.240 --> 18:27.200
This is quite effective.

[Yes. It's true.
Happiness comes with hardships.]

Wow, you have a lot of books.

18:49.040 --> 18:50.120

18:51.640 --> 18:52.880
Of course.

18:54.120 --> 18:55.280
What an unexpected hobby.

18:55.560 --> 18:58.160
What are you saying? Didn't I tell you?

18:59.040 --> 19:01.680
I once dreamt of becoming a writer.

19:01.760 --> 19:03.520
-Really?
-Yes.

19:04.160 --> 19:05.840
I wanted to write romance novels.

19:06.400 --> 19:08.120
I gave up on it early though.

19:08.320 --> 19:09.600
Why did you give up on it?

19:09.960 --> 19:12.280
I didn't think I was good enough.

19:12.360 --> 19:15.880
Why not? It suits you. Writer Kim Yu-mi.

19:17.280 --> 19:20.440
Then did you always want
to be a game developer?

19:20.520 --> 19:21.520
No.

19:22.480 --> 19:25.520
My dream was to do nothing
and play games all day.

19:25.760 --> 19:27.960
But it was impossible to live off
of doing nothing.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.000
It sounds just like you.

19:40.800 --> 19:42.320
Is that your mother?

19:43.560 --> 19:45.040
Yes. It's my mom.

19:45.800 --> 19:47.440
That's my dad.

19:47.520 --> 19:51.160
And that person over there is my grandma.

19:52.560 --> 19:55.840
I lived with her
until I was in high school.

19:56.360 --> 19:58.120
She passed away.

19:59.280 --> 20:01.400
Whenever I said my stomach hurt,

20:01.480 --> 20:03.440
my grandma always did this for me.

21:48.120 --> 21:50.760
Sure. But are you feeling okay?

21:51.320 --> 21:52.360
No problem.

-It's good.

-On weekends for three days.

22:28.600 --> 22:30.040
-To the beach?
-To the beach? Okay.

for a trip after that.

24:55.600 --> 24:56.920

we have to wait in line.

-Mr. Nam.
-Yes?

Can we eat out
instead of going to the cafeteria?

31:57.160 --> 31:58.840
I'm sick of the cafeteria.

32:00.400 --> 32:02.720
All right, then. Let's go out to eat.

-Right. There's no secret.

33:44.160 --> 33:47.000
Yes, ma'am. What kind of room do you want?

33:47.080 --> 33:49.720
A room with the ocean view, double bed.

33:50.120 --> 33:54.640
Ma'am, I can't hear you clearly.
Could you speak up a little?

33:54.720 --> 33:57.680
A room with the ocean view, and what else?

33:58.760 --> 34:00.800

[Pardon?]

34:11.120 --> 34:13.480
With one large bed.

34:14.280 --> 34:16.840
I see, with a double bed.

34:17.560 --> 34:20.920
Well, for now, on August 1 and 2...

34:21.440 --> 34:25.199
We only have ocean view rooms
with twin beds.

34:26.360 --> 34:28.600
-Pardon?
-Then we have no choice.

34:28.679 --> 34:30.520
Then we will take the ocean view room
with twin beds.

34:30.600 --> 34:32.320
No! Are you kidding me?

34:34.440 --> 34:36.080
[Two beds?]

34:36.600 --> 34:38.760
That should not happen in a couple's trip.

34:38.840 --> 34:41.920
You must get a double bed!

34:43.760 --> 34:47.320
Gosh, it's suddenly so cold. I'm so cold.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.000
Well...

34:51.520 --> 34:54.960
It doesn't have to be
the ocean view room then.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.080
Do you have any other rooms
with a double bed?

34:59.360 --> 35:03.080
There are rooms
with a double bed available,

35:03.560 --> 35:06.600
but they face the parking lot.
Will that be okay?

35:06.680 --> 35:08.880
The parking lot?

35:08.960 --> 35:11.800
It's a shame, but we will take the room
with a double bed facing the parking lot.

35:11.880 --> 35:13.600
No! We can't!

35:13.680 --> 35:15.960
We're going to the beach,
and the room is facing the parking lot?

35:21.560 --> 35:22.760

35:39.760 --> 35:42.000
I can't give up on the ocean view.

35:45.080 --> 35:48.360
Well, facing the parking lot seems...

35:50.320 --> 35:52.120
Do I have to choose between the two?

35:52.400 --> 35:55.360
We do have one ocean view room
with a double bed left,

35:55.440 --> 35:57.120
but the guests don't usually
take this room.

35:57.200 --> 35:58.920
What is it? I'll take it.

35:59.840 --> 36:02.320
The bathroom has glass walls.

36:10.120 --> 36:11.880
Yes, go ahead.

it has the double bed,
so what's the problem?

36:58.600 --> 37:01.960
I guess we can enjoy various views.

37:32.680 --> 37:34.720
No way. I can't let that happen.

37:45.360 --> 37:48.760
Well, glass walls are

37:49.560 --> 37:50.920
too much.

45:13.560 --> 45:17.720
[Hello. With the best view in Sokcho.
It's Julie Hotel.]

45:18.040 --> 45:20.360
[Please press the button.]

45:22.680 --> 45:24.640
[We always do our best, it's Julie Hotel.]

45:24.720 --> 45:25.720
Hello?

45:26.560 --> 45:29.280
I'd like to change my reservation.
It's Kim Yu-mi.

45:30.160 --> 45:33.600
Yes, I booked a reservation for two nights
and I'd like to cancel it.

45:33.960 --> 45:36.760
If you cancel it on the day,
there is no refund.

45:36.840 --> 45:38.280
Do you still want to proceed?

45:38.360 --> 45:39.400
No refund at all?

45:39.480 --> 45:42.520
[Yes, there is no refund
for cancellations on the day.]

45:44.600 --> 45:47.560
Then can I get a different room?

45:47.640 --> 45:49.680
I don't care about the view.

45:49.760 --> 45:52.600
The parking view is okay
or a twin bed is okay.

45:52.920 --> 45:55.680
[Julie Hotel Sokcho]

45:54.720 --> 45:57.840
All rooms are booked for today.

45:58.080 --> 45:59.640
I must change it.

45:59.720 --> 46:01.320
It only has to be a room.

46:01.720 --> 46:02.800
Please.

46:02.880 --> 46:04.880
It's impossible.

46:04.960 --> 46:07.960
I'll give you a call
if there's any cancellation.

46:08.040 --> 46:10.920
There's no if. I have a reason.

46:15.200 --> 46:16.240
Then

46:17.240 --> 46:19.560
I will just cancel it.

46:19.640 --> 46:22.080
[There is no refund.
Are you okay with that?]

46:24.200 --> 46:25.720
-Yes...
-No.

46:25.800 --> 46:27.880
-No. That's a lot of money.
-No refund.

46:27.120 --> 46:30.040
[No refund]

46:27.960 --> 46:30.560
Kill me first before you cancel it.

46:32.120 --> 46:33.640
[Do you want to proceed?]

46:35.560 --> 46:37.720
No. Never mind.

46:38.520 --> 46:39.640
Okay.

46:39.920 --> 46:41.480
[Thank you.]

46:40.800 --> 46:44.120
[No refund]

46:45.880 --> 46:47.040
What do I do?

46:57.680 --> 46:58.920
There's nothing I can do.

47:00.160 --> 47:01.280
Now this happened...

47:01.360 --> 47:02.480
She has to play innocent.

47:02.560 --> 47:03.680
Play innocent?

47:03.760 --> 47:06.800
She has to pretend she didn't know
anything about the glass shower.

47:06.880 --> 47:08.680
She can't be a pervert.

47:14.040 --> 47:15.040
Look.

47:15.600 --> 47:17.560
We've reached Julie Hotel.

47:18.160 --> 47:20.040
-Do you see it?
-Yes.

47:20.520 --> 47:22.720
It's cool.

47:33.720 --> 47:35.040
Who did you reserve it under?

47:35.120 --> 47:36.160
Kim Yu-mi.

47:38.040 --> 47:40.720
Ocean view double bedroom for two nights?

47:40.800 --> 47:42.000
Yes, that's right.

47:43.480 --> 47:44.520
Here it is.

47:45.200 --> 47:46.680
Have a good time.

47:51.040 --> 47:52.880
-Let's go.
-Okay.

47:55.880 --> 47:57.840
It's on the 19th floor.
The view will be amazing.

47:58.440 --> 48:00.040
You picked the nice one, Yu-mi.

48:09.880 --> 48:11.280
-Let's go in.
-Yes.

48:17.320 --> 48:19.320
My goodness. Look at the view.

48:20.120 --> 48:21.800
It's a real ocean view.

48:25.400 --> 48:26.880
Wait. What is that?

48:28.880 --> 48:30.080
What is this?

48:33.240 --> 48:34.240
What is it?

48:35.200 --> 48:36.480
Yu-mi. Look at this.

48:37.360 --> 48:38.440
The bathroom...

48:40.320 --> 48:41.360
My.

48:42.160 --> 48:45.440
Is this the bizarre room
you talked about earlier?

48:46.440 --> 48:47.560
What's this?

48:50.320 --> 48:53.160
There must be blinds or something.

48:54.480 --> 48:55.560
There's nothing.

48:56.040 --> 48:57.400
Is there really nothing?

48:57.480 --> 48:58.560
There's really nothing.

48:59.360 --> 49:00.680
What is this?

49:01.400 --> 49:02.960
Is there another restroom?

49:05.400 --> 49:06.400
What?

49:08.840 --> 49:09.880
Wait.

49:13.680 --> 49:16.600
What happened? I just reserved

49:17.120 --> 49:20.400
the ocean view double bedroom
like you said.

49:21.080 --> 49:23.840
It is the ocean view double bedroom,

49:24.640 --> 49:26.600
but did they tell you about the bathroom?

49:27.680 --> 49:29.560
-No.
-This is ridiculous.

49:29.720 --> 49:31.880
They should've notified us.

49:32.240 --> 49:33.680
How are we going to shower here?

49:34.840 --> 49:36.000
I know.

49:36.800 --> 49:37.960
This is absurd.

49:42.480 --> 49:44.520
But the view is amazing.

49:44.920 --> 49:47.200
Let's forget about it
since the view is nice.

49:47.840 --> 49:49.760
Are you okay with it?

49:51.360 --> 49:53.120
I'm not,

49:54.240 --> 49:56.760
but what can I do about it?
We got the room already.

49:57.360 --> 49:59.920
Let's take turns for shower,
and the other person can stay outside.

50:00.000 --> 50:01.320
Why don't we do that?

50:02.280 --> 50:04.720
Still...

50:04.800 --> 50:06.720
I'm okay, Woong.

50:09.560 --> 50:11.000
I'm really okay.

50:12.760 --> 50:14.280
If you're okay...

50:14.360 --> 50:15.400
I like it.

50:15.480 --> 50:18.240
I'm just happy to stay in Julie Hotel.

50:18.960 --> 50:20.160
Thanks, Woong.

50:23.240 --> 50:24.320
We did it.

50:25.000 --> 50:26.120
He'll let go.

50:26.480 --> 50:28.400
Our acting was great.

50:28.600 --> 50:30.320
Can we enjoy it now?

50:30.400 --> 50:33.080
Look at the ocean.

50:36.400 --> 50:37.960
This is so nice.

50:38.320 --> 50:40.720
Woong. The view is amazing.

50:42.160 --> 50:44.040
I love it.

50:45.520 --> 50:47.480
Woong. Why don't you come out?

50:57.560 --> 50:58.680
Woong?

51:01.000 --> 51:02.160
Where did he go?

51:06.080 --> 51:07.160
Woong?

51:22.080 --> 51:23.160
[Yes, Yu-mi.]

51:23.440 --> 51:24.880
Woong. Where are you?

51:25.080 --> 51:26.400
I'm going to the lobby.

51:26.840 --> 51:28.960
-What for?
-I'm going to file a complaint.

51:29.120 --> 51:30.560
I can't let it slide.

51:30.840 --> 51:32.600
What do you mean? It's a nice room.

51:32.680 --> 51:33.760
I said I don't mind.

51:33.840 --> 51:35.640
No. I have to tell them.

51:35.960 --> 51:37.040
Take a rest.

51:37.200 --> 51:39.120
Woong. Woong?

51:41.880 --> 51:43.200
Yes.

51:43.720 --> 51:45.760
Okay.

51:47.240 --> 51:48.760
What can I help you with?

51:48.960 --> 51:51.280
We just checked in.

51:51.360 --> 51:53.960
Oh, yes. Is there a problem?

51:54.440 --> 51:57.120
-Yes.
-What's the problem?

51:57.600 --> 52:00.320
It's a glass bathroom.

52:00.480 --> 52:01.640
Pardon?

52:02.040 --> 52:04.240
Oh, yes. That room has

52:04.320 --> 52:06.480
a special glass bathroom.

52:06.560 --> 52:07.880
That is the problem right now.

52:08.280 --> 52:11.760
We reserved a normal ocean view
double bedroom.

52:12.000 --> 52:15.240
Look. How am I supposed to use
the bathroom? It's so embarrassing.

52:15.520 --> 52:18.720
You should've notified us
when we booked the room.

52:18.800 --> 52:20.080
We probably did.

52:20.280 --> 52:23.200
There are only three rooms
with that bathroom in this hotel.

52:23.280 --> 52:24.720
Our rule is

52:24.800 --> 52:27.200
we never give that room
unless you ask for it first.

52:27.280 --> 52:29.480
I'm filing a complaint
because we got that room

52:29.560 --> 52:31.280
when we didn't ask for it.

52:31.760 --> 52:33.600
That would never happen.

52:40.960 --> 52:42.200
Where did he go?

52:46.880 --> 52:49.040
[-Hello?]
-Woong. Where are you?

52:49.120 --> 52:50.480
I don't see you in the lobby.

52:50.560 --> 52:51.840
I'm in the office.

52:52.440 --> 52:53.800
What do you mean, the office?

52:53.880 --> 52:55.960
[They keep saying they notified us.]

52:56.040 --> 52:57.200
They blamed you.

52:57.480 --> 53:00.840
I got upset, and I'm here to meet
the reservation manager.

53:01.840 --> 53:02.920
[They only need to apologize,]

53:03.000 --> 53:04.960
[but they keep arguing
they didn't do anything wrong.]

53:05.160 --> 53:08.400
I told them to listen to the recording.

53:09.200 --> 53:10.320
And they will.

53:10.800 --> 53:11.920
What?

53:12.200 --> 53:13.800
No, Woong. Stop it.

53:13.880 --> 53:15.680
We're here to have fun.

53:15.760 --> 53:17.440
What's the point of listening
to the recording?

53:17.520 --> 53:19.480
We need to find our rights as a consumer.

53:20.120 --> 53:22.240
When I'm angry, I take it to the end.

53:23.480 --> 53:24.520
[Sir.]

53:24.880 --> 53:27.680
Did you say you made a reservation
on the 27th at noon?

53:27.760 --> 53:28.880
Yes.

53:29.560 --> 53:31.560
Yu-mi. Just wait.

53:31.960 --> 53:33.160
Woong. No.

53:34.120 --> 53:35.240
Hello?

53:39.240 --> 53:41.440
What's going on?
You said she just has to play innocent.

53:41.520 --> 53:42.760
What's going on?

53:42.960 --> 53:45.000
I didn't know Woong was so stubborn.

53:46.280 --> 53:49.640
Why on earth is he doing that?

53:53.960 --> 53:56.360
Excuse me. Where's the reservation office?

53:56.440 --> 53:58.000
-Pardon?
-The reservation office.

53:58.080 --> 54:00.080
Oh, it's that way.

54:00.160 --> 54:01.360
Thank you.

54:02.320 --> 54:03.400
[Listen carefully.]

54:03.720 --> 54:07.080
She talked to Ms. Kim Yu-mi
on the phone twice.

54:09.200 --> 54:11.240
[We always do our best, it's Julie Hotel.]

54:11.320 --> 54:12.680
[What can I do for you?]

54:14.320 --> 54:16.240
I'd like to make a reservation for a room.

54:16.320 --> 54:17.840
For August 1 and 2.

54:17.960 --> 54:21.040
[Yes, ma'am.
What kind of room do you want?]

54:21.360 --> 54:23.880
[A room with the ocean view, double bed.]

54:23.960 --> 54:26.960
See?
A room with the ocean view, double bed.

54:27.040 --> 54:28.160
I told you.

54:28.480 --> 54:30.360
She never asked for the glass bathroom.

54:36.000 --> 54:39.080
[What about other rooms?
So all the rooms are booked?]

54:39.880 --> 54:42.920
[The room with a double bed
I told you before is the only one left.]

54:43.200 --> 54:46.040
[But you said you were not comfortable
with the bathroom.]

54:48.360 --> 54:50.080
-Yu-mi. When did you...
-Let's go.

54:50.160 --> 54:51.320
Wait. Hold on.

54:51.720 --> 54:53.160
I haven't finished listening to it yet.

54:53.240 --> 54:55.200
I asked for it.

54:55.320 --> 54:56.720
I asked for that room.

54:57.200 --> 54:58.200
What?

54:58.280 --> 54:59.600
I asked for it.

54:59.680 --> 55:00.760
Let's go now.

55:00.960 --> 55:01.960
What...

55:02.280 --> 55:04.600
[I don't care!
I love bathrooms with glass walls!]

55:04.680 --> 55:06.640
[Let me have the bathroom
with the glass walls! Please!]

55:10.720 --> 55:12.920
[Okay, ma'am.]

55:21.520 --> 55:22.560
We're doomed.

55:22.720 --> 55:23.880
What now?

55:25.640 --> 55:26.640
We're doomed.

55:27.000 --> 55:28.080
We're doomed.

55:30.320 --> 55:31.960
What are you doing? Have you gone crazy?

55:32.480 --> 55:33.600
We're totally doomed.

55:34.880 --> 55:35.920
What's wrong with him?

55:39.680 --> 55:40.760
I said

55:41.680 --> 55:43.400
I asked for it.

55:44.240 --> 55:45.360
I told you.

55:47.440 --> 55:48.720
Have a good day.

55:57.800 --> 55:58.840
There was

55:59.400 --> 56:01.080
no other room left.

56:04.160 --> 56:05.320
Okay.

56:08.920 --> 56:10.800
Shall we go now?

56:12.200 --> 56:13.360
Yes.

56:19.840 --> 56:23.120
Have a good time in our hotel.

56:44.520 --> 56:46.240
Where should we go?

56:49.640 --> 56:50.680
To the room?

56:53.960 --> 56:54.960
Or

56:57.200 --> 56:58.280
do you want to go out?

57:01.440 --> 57:02.480
Are you hungry?

57:03.640 --> 57:04.720
Let's go eat first.

57:07.320 --> 57:08.360
Sure.

57:08.440 --> 57:09.520
Okay.

57:10.120 --> 57:12.320
Sure. Let's go.

57:21.920 --> 57:25.160
[What did I tell you?]

57:27.640 --> 57:28.720
We're doomed.

57:29.480 --> 57:32.680
I said never a glass bathroom.

57:32.840 --> 57:35.480
You listened to pervert Lust
and made an irrational move.

57:35.560 --> 57:37.760
Look how humiliating this is.

57:37.880 --> 57:40.120
Etiquette. Will you be quiet?

57:40.400 --> 57:43.200
Reason has lost his reason.

57:43.280 --> 57:45.200
Whatever.

57:46.000 --> 57:47.240
My goodness.

57:54.240 --> 57:55.320
Have some boiled pork.

58:00.040 --> 58:01.880
It's delicious, right?

58:03.680 --> 58:04.680
Yes.

58:05.960 --> 58:07.440
Where shall we go after this?

58:08.800 --> 58:09.880
Anywhere.

58:13.680 --> 58:15.320
What shall we do about the room?

58:18.000 --> 58:20.960
It's a bit inconvenient,
but the view is still nice.

58:21.080 --> 58:22.240
Shall we just use it?

58:24.920 --> 58:28.160
It's hard to reserve other places
because it's the weekend.

58:30.200 --> 58:33.200
You told me to reserve
the ocean view double bedroom.

58:34.040 --> 58:35.400
So I did.

58:36.840 --> 58:39.640
-I know.
-That was the only room left.

58:40.880 --> 58:41.880
Okay.

58:41.960 --> 58:44.080
It's not that I wanted the glass bathroom.

58:46.280 --> 58:47.520
I get it.

58:51.800 --> 58:52.800
Why are you laughing?

58:52.880 --> 58:54.360
-What?
-Are you laughing at me?

58:54.880 --> 58:56.760
You think I'm a pervert?

58:56.840 --> 58:58.440
That's not it.

-I thought you were cute.
-Cute?

You always say I'm cute
when you're in trouble.

in my house,

This is not even funny compared to that.

Wait a minute. That was quite mean.

59:23.880 --> 59:25.800
It's so cheap for her to bring that up.

59:25.880 --> 59:28.000
Calm down. She's saying that

59:28.080 --> 59:30.840
because she's embarrassed.

59:30.960 --> 59:32.640
Right now, we should understand her.

I am sorry to inform you,
but this is no time to be sullen.

1:00:08.600 --> 1:00:11.160
Yu-mi is very embarrassed and humiliated.

1:00:11.280 --> 1:00:12.920
We must understand her.

1:01:06.360 --> 1:01:07.880
I'd feel bad.

1:01:12.480 --> 1:01:15.040
What then? Shall we just go home?

1:01:15.480 --> 1:01:17.600
We can just cancel the hotel and go home.

Yes. You made a good choice.

1:02:09.440 --> 1:02:12.320

Don't you have to do it now?

1:03:06.880 --> 1:03:10.040
There's no refund anyway.
I'll do it in the rest area.

Oh, right. My bag.
We left our bags in the room.
