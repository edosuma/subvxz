00:12.721 --> 00:15.641
Some of these places
I haven't been in 20 years.

00:16.265 --> 00:17.516
Just see it in my memory.

00:18.060 --> 00:19.650
But I don't know how it is.

00:20.604 --> 00:22.024
I'm a little curious myself.

00:24.107 --> 00:25.067
Let's start off--

00:25.609 --> 00:27.689
Would you like to see the dental office?

00:31.532 --> 00:34.452
<i>Dentistry is a very tough job.</i>
<i>A very tough job.</i>

00:36.370 --> 00:38.660
Well, I got the corner office here, guys.

00:39.248 --> 00:40.248
That is my office.

00:41.542 --> 00:45.132
Made a nice living out of it,
wound up with three dental offices.

00:46.630 --> 00:49.300
Uh, never bought a practice,
I started from scratch.

00:49.383 --> 00:50.973
Wound up with 12,000 patients.

00:52.344 --> 00:53.184
Uh...

00:53.554 --> 00:55.014
Yeah, it almost killed me.

00:59.184 --> 01:02.694
<i>I was a practicing dentist</i>
<i>with a drug problem.</i>

01:03.814 --> 01:06.234
<i>Great dentist with a drug problem.</i>

01:09.027 --> 01:13.317
<i>Getting sober took about nine years.</i>

01:15.325 --> 01:18.195
And do I blame, uh, Maskell?

01:18.662 --> 01:20.462
Yes, I do. Do I blame myself?

01:20.539 --> 01:21.499
Yes, I do.

01:28.922 --> 01:31.802
<i>I went to St. Clement's.</i>
<i>I believe I started in 1958...</i>

01:32.426 --> 01:33.756
<i>uh, in first grade.</i>

01:36.555 --> 01:39.305
<i>The summer</i>
<i>between my seventh and eighth grade...</i>

01:45.355 --> 01:46.315
<i>I was an altar boy.</i>

01:50.777 --> 01:53.487
<i>Masses back in those days,</i>
<i>in the summer, went six o'clock,</i>

01:53.572 --> 01:56.412
<i>seven o'clock, and eight o'clock,</i>
<i>Monday through Friday.</i>

01:58.368 --> 02:02.408
They had a lot of Masses
because the parish was a thriving parish.

02:03.624 --> 02:06.634
<i>So, I would sit, say, a six o'clock Mass</i>
<i>or a seven o'clock Mass,</i>

02:06.710 --> 02:09.300
<i>and I'd have to--</i>
<i>I'd ride my bicycle down.</i>

02:12.507 --> 02:15.007
<i>That's where I met Father Maskell</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

02:16.595 --> 02:21.175
<i>Really got to-- </i> [stammers]
<i>Started to know the fellow.</i>

02:24.770 --> 02:29.610
By November of my eighth grade,
he was driving me home.

02:31.401 --> 02:33.361
<i>He'd say, "Put the bike in the trunk.</i>

02:33.445 --> 02:36.105
<i>I'm gonna drive you home."</i>
<i>And we'd stop for a snowball.</i>

02:39.284 --> 02:42.414
I was the golden boy, I could do no wrong.

02:45.749 --> 02:49.589
This is St. Clement's Church over here.
Father Maskell was associate pastor.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.172
Look, this was the classroom.

02:53.507 --> 02:56.087
Here was a classroom
for the seventh and eighth grade.

03:00.055 --> 03:02.715
<i>Father Maskell would come</i>
<i>into my classroom...</i>

03:03.975 --> 03:07.515
<i>and ask to talk to me,</i>
<i>and he'd want to see me up at the rectory.</i>

03:08.772 --> 03:09.772
We're running up here.

03:10.273 --> 03:12.943
This is the-- The old rectory.

03:14.569 --> 03:16.779
<i>And at first,</i>
<i>it might have been once a week...</i>

03:17.447 --> 03:20.737
then it got to be where it was like
two, three, uh, times a week.

03:21.243 --> 03:26.123
And a lot of times I--
From lunch until the day ended,

03:26.873 --> 03:30.133
which I think was like 2:30,
I wouldn't be back in class.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.840
I'd be up at the rectory
with Father Maskell.

03:38.260 --> 03:40.140
Uh-uh. Is that it right there?

03:42.973 --> 03:44.853
Unbelievable. It's hard to recognize it.

03:49.688 --> 03:50.518
It's changed.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.395
Didn't change much.
If I had to bet the farm on it,

03:54.484 --> 03:57.324
I'd say that was his office right there,
because I dashed up.

03:57.404 --> 03:58.704
[Charles makes whooshing sound]

04:00.240 --> 04:02.950
-[man] Is that where the abuse happened?
-Yes, yes, yes.

04:07.914 --> 04:10.754
<i>Father Maskell taught me</i>
<i>how to drink and forget problems.</i>

04:11.626 --> 04:14.336
<i>Father Maskell taught me</i>
<i>how to, uh, take a drug</i>

04:14.755 --> 04:17.915
<i>if, uh, I wanted to forget</i>
<i>about what was happening around me.</i>

04:20.969 --> 04:24.769
The first wine I drank
was out of a chalice.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.692
Okay. And he said, "I have wine
that's left over from Mass,

04:28.769 --> 04:30.479
can you take care of it for me?"

04:33.940 --> 04:35.690
Because, you know, I was altar boy.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.449
That's where it--
That's how it all started.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.276
<i>I knew the young Maskell.</i>

04:42.616 --> 04:46.576
<i>And as he got older,</i>
<i>he got meaner, dirtier, and more evil.</i>

04:48.497 --> 04:52.957
So, if we get anything
out of this conversation today, okay...

04:54.753 --> 04:56.763
if the Catholic Church...

04:58.006 --> 05:01.586
would have dealt
with this properly back in '67,

05:02.177 --> 05:03.507
<i>and they knew about it...</i>

05:04.763 --> 05:06.523
<i>there would have been no murder.</i>

05:10.060 --> 05:11.230
We-- We wouldn't be here.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.140
There you are.

06:25.802 --> 06:28.052
-There's a Cesnik if I ever met one.
-Gerry.

06:28.138 --> 06:29.348
Nice to see you.

06:29.764 --> 06:30.934
-How are you?
-Fine.

06:31.766 --> 06:32.806
-I know.
-I am now.

06:33.351 --> 06:34.731
[Marilyn] Thank you for coming.

06:34.978 --> 06:37.728
It just makes me wanna cry,
the two of you getting together.

06:37.814 --> 06:40.444
This just makes me wanna cry.

06:40.525 --> 06:42.105
We've been talking about the ring.

06:42.193 --> 06:44.453
-I'm wondering if-- Do you have it with--?
-[Marilyn] I do.

06:44.529 --> 06:46.569
Yeah. The ring that I gave Cathy.

06:48.074 --> 06:49.914
And I told them I could identify it.

06:59.836 --> 07:00.796
That's it.

07:01.212 --> 07:04.802
I have to tell you that that ring
was on Cathy the day she died.

07:05.634 --> 07:07.804
[Gerry] The inside is engraved in Greek.

07:09.095 --> 07:11.175
[speaking Greek]

07:14.851 --> 07:18.231
[in English]
Agape is the unconditional love,

07:18.313 --> 07:20.483
the characteristic supposedly
of Christians.

07:21.358 --> 07:22.858
That's what the ring says.

07:23.485 --> 07:26.815
[Marilyn] Learning all this about Cathy,
I didn't know any of this.

07:26.905 --> 07:30.195
I started going through my mother's things
and I found all this.

07:30.784 --> 07:31.914
Somebody murdered her.

07:32.702 --> 07:34.372
They need to investigate this.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.674
My visit to the police was not--

07:36.915 --> 07:38.665
Did not bring me any closure.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.130
It opened up more questions to me.

07:44.798 --> 07:48.718
<i>It was August 1969,</i>
<i>she came home to Pittsburgh.</i>

07:52.055 --> 07:55.925
<i>She wanted to explain</i>
<i>why she was leaving Keough</i>

07:56.017 --> 07:59.267
<i>to those that she cared about</i>
<i>and those who cared about her.</i>

08:02.190 --> 08:05.240
<i>When Cathy came home,</i>
<i>it was always so happy,</i>

08:05.318 --> 08:08.528
and we would stay up all night
laughing and talking,

08:09.572 --> 08:12.332
<i>but she wasn't her happy-go-lucky self.</i>

08:13.576 --> 08:15.196
<i>She definitely was sad.</i>

08:15.996 --> 08:17.786
And at the time, I--

08:17.872 --> 08:22.092
I attributed some of this to the changes
that were going on in her life.

08:27.757 --> 08:32.047
Turns out, in the September
before she died, she came to see me.

08:33.138 --> 08:37.268
Because by then she found out
that they were declining the experiment,

08:37.976 --> 08:39.976
and that the order put her in--

08:40.395 --> 08:43.265
Well, you either go back
into the convent, or you leave.

08:43.773 --> 08:46.113
And I did know that she had
to give an answer by--

08:46.943 --> 08:48.153
By December 31st.

08:48.236 --> 08:52.816
So, at the time she died,
she had about six or seven more weeks

08:53.408 --> 08:56.198
in which to answer the ultimatum
that she was given.

08:57.162 --> 09:00.502
She said there's so much going on
in my mind now.

09:01.249 --> 09:02.919
I think the experiment...

09:04.461 --> 09:05.341
was here.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.760
-[Diane] Mm-hm.
-I think Gerry was here.

09:08.214 --> 09:10.384
And I think the abuse was here.

09:10.467 --> 09:12.047
Yeah. Yeah.

09:13.261 --> 09:16.141
[Marilyn] <i>She had been in the convent</i>
<i>for so long</i>

09:16.389 --> 09:19.729
<i>that my parents were concerned,</i>
<i>my dad especially,</i>

09:20.310 --> 09:24.270
<i>that she was gonna struggle</i>
<i>with living out in the world, you know.</i>

09:25.815 --> 09:28.735
<i>My dad said, "You don't pay bills.</i>

09:28.902 --> 09:31.742
<i>You don't get a paycheck in the convent.</i>

09:32.280 --> 09:35.780
<i>The world is a dangerous place</i>
<i>and you don't understand that."</i>

09:36.659 --> 09:39.909
<i>And she said, "How do you know</i>
<i>my world's not a dangerous place?</i>

09:42.749 --> 09:45.749
<i>How do you know there's not danger</i>
<i>in what I'm doing now?"</i>

09:47.962 --> 09:50.922
<i>I questioned it for a time frame,</i>
<i>and I kept thinking</i>

09:51.007 --> 09:54.797
<i>if she told me about the experiment,</i>
<i>she would've told me about the abuse,</i>

09:55.470 --> 09:59.930
but, um, the more I think about it now,
she would have never told me.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.556
<i>She was very protective of me,</i>

10:03.978 --> 10:07.518
<i>being her younger sister,</i>
<i>still being in college.</i>

10:10.318 --> 10:13.488
<i>And I can imagine</i>
<i>that heavy burden on her,</i>

10:14.322 --> 10:17.622
'cause Cathy never said
she was gonna do something she didn't do.

10:18.535 --> 10:21.155
If she told them
she was gonna make it stop, she--

10:21.246 --> 10:24.166
If that portion of all of this
is accurate...

10:25.416 --> 10:28.336
<i>all of these girls</i>
<i>can't all be telling a lie.</i>

10:30.088 --> 10:33.928
<i>Cathy would have been working</i>
<i>to make it stop, no doubt in my mind.</i>

10:37.303 --> 10:40.063
-Still-- It's still a great puzzle to me.
-[Diane] Yes.

10:40.140 --> 10:43.430
I mean, neither of us knew anything
about this abuse stuff.

10:43.518 --> 10:45.558
-This is the puzzle.
-As part of the context.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.105
-And Russell--
-Until 1994.

10:47.605 --> 10:49.395
-And what did Russell know?
-Russell.

10:55.989 --> 11:00.619
After Cathy died,
Russ just wanted to be separated

11:00.702 --> 11:04.502
from anything related to convent life,

11:04.581 --> 11:06.171
<i>related to Cathy.</i>

11:06.666 --> 11:07.956
<i>She wanted a new life.</i>

11:09.669 --> 11:16.219
<i>So, Russ left the convent, got married,</i>
<i>and had two children.</i>

11:18.845 --> 11:20.675
I sold her a house, actually.

11:21.055 --> 11:25.055
<i>She moved out here to Carroll County,</i>
<i>and we did a lot together.</i>

11:26.185 --> 11:30.225
<i>I had many conversations with her,</i>
<i>but it would never go in that direction,</i>

11:30.315 --> 11:31.645
she wouldn't allow it.

11:31.983 --> 11:33.993
And I would say, "What happened?

11:35.028 --> 11:36.858
<i>Do you know more than you're saying?</i>

11:37.405 --> 11:38.945
Why can't you talk about it?"

11:39.365 --> 11:42.735
And she'd say,
"My life is in a different place.

11:43.161 --> 11:45.831
That was my life before."
That's what she'd say.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.580
It was like, one day, she's gonna talk.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.076
One day, it's gonna come out.

11:56.549 --> 11:59.929
[Patricia]
<i>1997, I heard that she had cancer.</i>

12:00.595 --> 12:03.465
We stayed in touch.
I went to visit her in the hospital

12:03.556 --> 12:05.886
<i>when she had surgeries</i>
<i>and things like that.</i>

12:07.435 --> 12:11.605
<i>A couple years pass, and it's 2001.</i>

12:12.023 --> 12:15.493
You know, the stories are out
in papers and all that,

12:15.568 --> 12:17.858
and Maskell's name was being mentioned.

12:18.780 --> 12:20.740
<i>So, this friend of mine</i>

12:20.823 --> 12:23.793
<i>was working as a nurse</i>
<i>at Stella Maris hospice,</i>

12:24.452 --> 12:26.502
<i>and she calls me up and said,</i>

12:26.579 --> 12:30.629
"Pat, I want you to know
that Father Maskell died this afternoon.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.462
<i>But don't tell anybody,</i>
<i>I could lose my job."</i>

12:37.840 --> 12:41.470
<i>So, that evening, not listening</i>
<i>to my friend, I called Russ.</i>

12:41.552 --> 12:43.052
<i>That's the only person I called.</i>

12:43.137 --> 12:47.427
And I said, "Russ, I just want you to know
that Father Maskell died this afternoon."

12:47.934 --> 12:52.064
And Russ's one remark was,

12:52.355 --> 12:55.065
"Well, he went to his grave
with his secret."

12:58.361 --> 13:03.781
<i>Somehow, Russ did feel</i>
<i>that he was involved with Cathy's death.</i>

13:05.535 --> 13:08.495
And there was more to the story
than I knew.

13:09.330 --> 13:12.960
And then I get a phone call two days later
from her husband...

13:14.460 --> 13:15.840
<i>saying that Russ died.</i>

13:25.555 --> 13:29.095
Then we get some, um,
Saturday afternoon ice cream.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.226
-Yeah.
-[Jean] Mm-hm.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.690
I don't tell her
I put peanut butter right in it

13:36.774 --> 13:41.204
because this is more of the protein
that I want her to get,

13:41.863 --> 13:43.453
instead of just ice cream.

13:44.407 --> 13:45.577
I do the best I can.

13:45.658 --> 13:46.738
[laughing]

13:51.164 --> 13:53.884
<i>I was feeling feelings about my mom.</i>

13:54.542 --> 13:59.132
This feeling of that 16-year-old
behind that wall of lies,

13:59.213 --> 14:01.633
just saying, "Where were you?"

14:01.716 --> 14:03.966
You know, "Where were you?"

14:08.765 --> 14:12.885
<i>How she has been there for me</i>
<i>in so many ways,</i>

14:13.728 --> 14:19.938
<i>but how to let that be enough</i>
<i>when she wasn't there for me</i>

14:20.610 --> 14:21.900
when this was going on.

14:23.071 --> 14:27.331
<i>So, what I did what I asked Abbie if, um,</i>
<i>I wrote something, would she post it.</i>

14:32.538 --> 14:34.828
<i>"Hi, this is my first posting</i>

14:34.916 --> 14:37.166
on this wonderful grassroots
healing site.

14:38.294 --> 14:40.844
<i>As I care for my 88-year-old mother,</i>

14:41.130 --> 14:42.550
<i>I'm painfully aware</i>

14:42.799 --> 14:46.089
<i>of one of the many things robbed</i>
<i>from me by Joseph Maskell.</i>

14:47.053 --> 14:50.813
He took, deliberately and methodically,
my God-given right

14:50.890 --> 14:53.810
to a deep, trusting relationship
with my mom,

14:54.185 --> 14:56.145
and her right to be there for me."

14:58.147 --> 15:02.187
<i>The more that I am connecting</i>
<i>to the part of me</i>

15:02.276 --> 15:05.406
that survived after Cathy...

15:06.114 --> 15:08.534
um... the more I'm beginning to--

15:08.825 --> 15:10.535
To touch the anger.

15:10.618 --> 15:14.788
The anger pushes you forward
and you start talking to people,

15:14.872 --> 15:17.332
and being in front of a camera,
and you know--

15:17.500 --> 15:22.090
You start to do things
that put your feelings and thoughts

15:22.171 --> 15:26.181
out there for others to critique,
you know.

15:27.718 --> 15:29.758
[Abbie] <i>When I look back now</i>

15:29.846 --> 15:32.346
<i>at all the different personalities</i>
<i>that we've met,</i>

15:32.432 --> 15:38.402
Jean stands out as someone
who has consistently told

15:38.479 --> 15:42.569
<i>the same story, and has, sort of,</i>
<i>a sense of personal integrity.</i>

15:43.317 --> 15:48.527
She's taking her own insights
and the implications of all this,

15:48.865 --> 15:51.235
and trying to put the pieces together.

15:51.325 --> 15:55.785
But she's probably not willing
to be definite about it

15:55.872 --> 15:57.832
until she's absolutely sure.

16:04.881 --> 16:08.381
[Jean] <i>Brother Bob is still,</i>
<i>to this day, faceless to me.</i>

16:11.888 --> 16:15.808
<i>But my memory is beginning</i>
<i>to flesh out more and more.</i>

16:19.979 --> 16:24.029
<i>Brother Bob said to me</i>
<i>that he knew Cathy Cesnik</i>

16:24.484 --> 16:28.534
<i>and that, um, she was confiding in him</i>

16:28.613 --> 16:31.073
<i>that she was going to the police</i>
<i>about the abuse.</i>

16:33.409 --> 16:36.159
And he hit her,
he didn't mean to kill her.

16:38.539 --> 16:41.079
<i>On top of repressing the memories,</i>

16:41.959 --> 16:44.749
<i>the experience was so traumatizing</i>

16:45.004 --> 16:48.974
<i>that it's pushed a lot of the identity</i>
<i>of this person--</i>

16:49.050 --> 16:53.180
Any facial identity,
that has not surfaced.

16:57.975 --> 17:01.935
<i>I do remember that he had markings</i>
<i>on his abdomen.</i>

17:02.897 --> 17:06.857
It was a birthmark or it was a mole
of some sort, right over on this side.

17:07.443 --> 17:12.532
And he had a small incision
on the right side of his abdomen.

17:20.164 --> 17:24.594
<i>I understand that people are going</i>
<i>to wanna see if this one person,</i>

17:24.669 --> 17:26.919
me, who remembers what I remember,

17:27.505 --> 17:31.375
can't remember a little more
to get a little clearer,

17:33.094 --> 17:36.514
<i>to get more of an identity</i>
<i>to who that Brother Bob is.</i>

17:44.063 --> 17:47.233
<i>But I can't force myself</i>
<i>to remember anything else,</i>

17:47.316 --> 17:51.646
<i>and in all honesty, I don't know</i>
<i>when and if that is surfacing.</i>

17:59.453 --> 18:01.913
[Marilyn] Well, let me, um--
Just a little, Bob.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.455
That's good for me.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.003
I'll bet I can get it on my phone.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.625
Yeah, I got it on my phone.

18:09.714 --> 18:14.144
<i>When Cathy went missing, Russell told me--</i>
<i>She said, "Cathy went shopping</i>

18:14.218 --> 18:16.428
<i>to get you something</i>
<i>for your engagement."</i>

18:17.305 --> 18:20.215
I thought, oh, my gosh,
if we hadn't gotten engaged, you know--

18:20.308 --> 18:22.388
You know how you think that?
If I hadn't gotten engaged,

18:22.476 --> 18:25.186
she wouldn't have gone shopping,
and she wouldn't have been

18:25.271 --> 18:28.071
in the wrong place at the wrong time.
You know, which--

18:28.232 --> 18:30.282
The wrong-place-wrong-time story again.

18:33.321 --> 18:36.161
<i>She left to go shopping.</i>
<i>Other than that, I knew nothing.</i>

18:37.491 --> 18:40.241
<i>So, I didn't know if she'd died</i>
<i>before she got to the store,</i>

18:40.328 --> 18:41.998
<i>or after the store, or anything.</i>

18:46.083 --> 18:49.803
[Childs] <i>The entire mall was checked</i>
<i>by investigators from the city at the time</i>

18:49.879 --> 18:53.089
<i>in an attempt to locate a store</i>
<i>that she may have gone into.</i>

18:54.300 --> 18:55.640
There was no indication

18:55.926 --> 18:58.296
they were able to find
that she made this purchase.

18:58.387 --> 19:01.557
Now, she could've made
a cash purchase and, uh...

19:02.516 --> 19:04.226
they just weren't able to locate it,

19:04.310 --> 19:06.730
<i>but they never were able to make</i>
<i>that determination</i>

19:06.812 --> 19:09.732
<i>whether she actually, um,</i>
<i>made that purchase.</i>

19:13.861 --> 19:16.531
[Marilyn] I saw the necklace yesterday
for the first time.

19:16.614 --> 19:21.084
And, um, in looking at it,
the bell would symbolize a wedding,

19:21.160 --> 19:25.160
which makes sense, 'cause we had
just gotten engaged the week before.

19:26.290 --> 19:28.750
-Did you see this, Bob?
-Yeah. Let's see it.

19:31.712 --> 19:35.262
-Yeah, it does look like bell, doesn't it?
-[Jean] It does look like a bell.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.511
-It looks like it'd be appropriate.
-Yeah.

19:37.635 --> 19:39.635
And-- And your birthstone.

19:41.597 --> 19:44.597
So, I understand this birthstone
is a peridot

19:44.684 --> 19:47.404
<i>and that would be an August birthstone.</i>

19:48.145 --> 19:52.775
My husband's birthday is in August
so, it could've symbolized his birthday.

19:54.026 --> 19:57.446
<i>You have to understand,</i>
<i>Cathy was very, very happy for me</i>

19:57.780 --> 19:59.200
<i>that I chose Bob.</i>

20:00.700 --> 20:03.120
<i>She really thought Bob</i>
<i>would take care of me forever,</i>

20:03.202 --> 20:07.292
<i>and as a matter of fact, um,</i>
<i>Bob had gone to Vietnam for a year</i>

20:07.373 --> 20:08.833
<i>and my sister wrote to him,</i>

20:09.125 --> 20:12.035
<i>because she was trying to establish</i>
<i>a relationship with him.</i>

20:14.004 --> 20:17.304
<i>If this is true,</i>
<i>this would be so typical Cathy,</i>

20:17.508 --> 20:20.928
<i>because everything she did had a meaning</i>
<i>and everything was deep.</i>

20:21.470 --> 20:24.100
So, that would've been Cathy.

20:24.932 --> 20:25.932
Totally.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.119
[man speaking indistinctly on TV]

20:52.042 --> 20:55.502
[man] Um, Edgar, I wanted to show you
these pictures.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.221
You can flip through them.

21:03.512 --> 21:05.852
Does that look familiar to you at all?

21:05.931 --> 21:07.271
No.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.694
That's jewelry or something.

21:14.190 --> 21:15.070
[man] Mm-hm.

21:16.233 --> 21:20.283
It's a necklace that you gave
to your first wife for Christmas.

21:21.197 --> 21:22.947
Do you remember giving that to her?

21:23.866 --> 21:26.576
Her birthstone was red.

21:30.706 --> 21:34.246
So, why would you have gotten her
a green birthstone, which is August?

21:37.588 --> 21:39.548
I don't have the slightest idea.

21:41.759 --> 21:45.509
We know Sister Cathy was out buying
a present for her sister.

21:46.263 --> 21:51.523
And that, a month later,
you gave this necklace to your wife.

21:55.231 --> 21:57.441
Did you show it to Cathy's sister?

21:57.525 --> 22:02.605
Yeah, and Cathy's sister is wondering
whether that might be her necklace,

22:02.988 --> 22:06.528
uh, because she knows her sister was out
buying her an engagement present

22:06.617 --> 22:09.037
that night, and as you see
in that necklace,

22:09.328 --> 22:10.788
it has a wedding bell...

22:11.747 --> 22:14.997
it has a birthstone
that is the same birthstone

22:15.084 --> 22:18.754
as the man that Sister Cathy's sister
was marrying.

22:19.505 --> 22:22.505
So, she thinks there might be
some significance to that necklace,

22:22.591 --> 22:25.091
and she's wondering
whether you might have gotten it

22:25.177 --> 22:27.347
from Sister Cathy that night.

22:37.231 --> 22:39.281
[sighs]

22:42.278 --> 22:44.028
Means nothing to me.

22:45.990 --> 22:48.120
Did you encounter Sister Cathy that night?

22:48.742 --> 22:49.662
No.

22:50.619 --> 22:53.159
Now, if people think that
that was the necklace

22:53.247 --> 22:55.917
that Sister Cathy bought the night
she disappeared,

22:56.542 --> 22:58.632
and you gave it to your first wife,

22:58.711 --> 23:01.801
do you understand why people
are suspicious because of that?

23:02.298 --> 23:03.258
Mm-hm. [grunts]

23:13.350 --> 23:14.810
[Childs]
<i>There is a police report indicating</i>

23:14.893 --> 23:17.813
<i>that when, uh, Sister Cesnik went missing,</i>

23:18.230 --> 23:21.690
<i>we have an eyewitness</i>
<i>that saw a male driver</i>

23:21.775 --> 23:24.145
<i>driving Sister Cesnik's vehicle</i>
<i>from the scene.</i>

23:25.154 --> 23:28.994
<i>It appeared as though Sister Cesnik</i>
<i>was trying to exit the vehicle</i>

23:29.074 --> 23:32.544
on the passenger side,
but she never got out of the vehicle.

23:33.954 --> 23:38.464
<i>At the time the vehicle was recovered,</i>
<i>there was mud on the tires...</i>

23:38.542 --> 23:40.712
<i>there was a branch inside the vehicle.</i>

23:41.754 --> 23:44.134
<i>It was a twig, a small branch,</i>

23:44.757 --> 23:48.177
<i>and it would be consistent with the area</i>
<i>where the body was found.</i>

23:48.636 --> 23:51.506
<i>So, the driver would've been</i>
<i>the one to drive</i>

23:51.972 --> 23:53.892
<i>from the area where the body</i>
<i>was located</i>

23:53.974 --> 23:56.524
<i>back where the Carriage House was located,</i>

23:57.186 --> 24:00.396
<i>because he would've been the last person</i>
<i>to operate the vehicle.</i>

24:00.814 --> 24:03.944
[man] This might be urban legend,
and I don't know if it's in the reports,

24:04.026 --> 24:06.646
but we've heard that, uh,
there was indication

24:06.737 --> 24:08.067
that perhaps someone who drove

24:08.155 --> 24:12.275
with both of their feet might have driven
the car at some point that night.

24:12.368 --> 24:14.368
Does that ring any bells with you?

24:16.830 --> 24:18.620
[Childs] After they located the vehicle,

24:18.707 --> 24:22.337
there was mud located, um,
on the brake pedal

24:22.419 --> 24:25.299
but no mud recovered from the gas pedal,

24:26.006 --> 24:28.836
which may have led investigators
to believe that the person

24:28.926 --> 24:35.096
that drove the vehicle, um, used two feet
to, uh, operate the vehicle.

24:38.102 --> 24:41.442
[man] I'm just curious if by any chance
you drive with both of your feet?

24:43.273 --> 24:45.443
What's that got to do with anything?

24:45.526 --> 24:49.526
I was just curious because whoever drove
Cathy's car that night,

24:49.613 --> 24:54.333
based on the mud on the pedal,
drove with two different feet.

24:55.285 --> 24:56.655
I don't drive at all.

24:57.746 --> 24:58.906
But back in the day?

24:59.707 --> 25:01.707
-Did you drive with two feet?
-Yeah.

25:07.965 --> 25:11.925
I had nothing to do with her
disappearance, her murder or anything.

25:17.391 --> 25:18.981
[man] What about other suspects?

25:20.269 --> 25:23.439
<i>We have talked to Edgar Davidson</i>
<i>quite a few times,</i>

25:23.522 --> 25:28.362
<i>and he admitted that he is the person</i>
<i>who called </i> The Jerry Turner Show

25:28.902 --> 25:33.452
<i>in the '70s to talk about evidence</i>
<i>about the murder of Sister Cathy.</i>

25:34.033 --> 25:37.493
Are you able to verify or confirm
whether he's ever been looked at?

25:38.203 --> 25:42.043
No. I can't comment on anything
we're looking at currently

25:42.124 --> 25:43.924
or any part of that investigation.

25:44.001 --> 25:47.501
Some of the things I've commented on
is because you knew about them already,

25:47.588 --> 25:48.668
and I can comment.

25:49.423 --> 25:53.143
Then the other one is a neighbor
of Sister Cathy's named Billy Schmidt,

25:53.594 --> 25:55.144
<i>whose family we're working with,</i>

25:55.220 --> 25:59.850
<i>and they are, for various reasons,</i>
<i>convinced that their family member, Billy,</i>

25:59.933 --> 26:02.273
<i>who lived across the hall from her,</i>
<i>was involved.</i>

26:04.062 --> 26:07.362
As far as viable suspects,
current suspects,

26:07.816 --> 26:10.986
I can't say anything
regarding what we're doing

26:11.069 --> 26:12.399
or what we know about that.

26:13.947 --> 26:14.947
[dogs barking]

26:15.824 --> 26:19.544
[Barbara] <i>I told detectives about it</i>
<i>that came to see me in the '90s.</i>

26:20.287 --> 26:22.997
They were reopening the case.

26:23.707 --> 26:26.997
<i>And I've told them everything that I know</i>
<i>about it just like I'm telling you.</i>

26:28.170 --> 26:29.460
<i>I did ask them...</i>

26:30.672 --> 26:34.932
"I know you didn't have DNA back then,
but I know you have DNA today.

26:36.136 --> 26:39.426
Did you find any cigarette butts
back there where her body was found?

26:40.516 --> 26:41.846
<i>Maybe Salem?"</i>

26:42.601 --> 26:46.651
I told them Bill smoked Salem,
and they looked at each other,

26:47.731 --> 26:51.531
and the one said,
"Yeah, we did find some cigarette butts."

26:52.528 --> 26:54.398
<i>But I never heard how it turned out.</i>

26:55.989 --> 26:57.369
Well...

26:59.076 --> 27:02.576
We-- I can't tell you what,
but we have a piece of evidence

27:02.788 --> 27:05.668
that was recovered
that we did develop DNA from.

27:06.708 --> 27:08.288
[man 1] And is that piece of evidence--?

27:08.377 --> 27:10.457
Is that the cigarette
that I've heard about?

27:13.131 --> 27:14.011
[laughing]

27:14.132 --> 27:15.182
-Yeah.
-[man 2] Yes.

27:15.259 --> 27:20.009
Okay. And would that cigarette
most likely be linked to the crime?

27:24.142 --> 27:25.232
It could be.

27:25.310 --> 27:27.400
The reason we didn't really
wanna mention that

27:27.479 --> 27:29.979
is because we're still--
It's still open investigation,

27:30.065 --> 27:32.315
we still got a couple people
we wanna look at.

27:32.401 --> 27:33.941
Okay? Um...

27:34.903 --> 27:37.823
Let's just say this,
all the things you've commented on

27:38.365 --> 27:39.905
are all very interesting to me.

27:41.493 --> 27:43.663
And all of those things
will be re-looked at.

27:44.288 --> 27:48.958
Any person in the past that was looked at,
polygraphed, brought in for interviews,

27:49.793 --> 27:54.763
<i>Koob, McKeon, Maskell,</i>
<i>several other civilians...</i>

27:55.424 --> 27:58.144
<i>We are gonna revisit</i>
<i>a lot of these things.</i>

27:58.719 --> 28:02.259
And I do have hope that one day,
we solve this case.

28:12.399 --> 28:13.229
[Abbie] Uh...

28:14.484 --> 28:17.864
So, this is-- Yeah,
these are the Malecki papers,

28:17.946 --> 28:19.656
the old newspaper articles.

28:21.325 --> 28:23.575
<i>Four days after Sister Cathy was abducted,</i>

28:23.660 --> 28:29.040
<i>a young woman named Joyce Malecki</i>
<i>was abducted and murdered.</i>

28:30.751 --> 28:32.921
[Tom] <i>"Understandably,</i>
<i>police investigators</i>

28:33.003 --> 28:35.593
<i>and newspaper reporters</i>
<i>were intensely interested</i>

28:35.672 --> 28:39.262
<i>in the possibility that there might be</i>
<i>some connection between the two killings,</i>

28:40.135 --> 28:43.005
but no such link between the murders
has ever been established,

28:43.096 --> 28:46.676
according to FBI
and Baltimore Police officials today."

28:49.061 --> 28:50.561
Growing up at a young age,

28:50.729 --> 28:53.649
we went to St. Clement's
Catholic Church

28:53.732 --> 28:55.282
and we went to Sunday school.

28:56.193 --> 29:00.743
<i>We would walk down to St. Clement's,</i>
<i>we'd go past 1st Avenue</i>

29:00.822 --> 29:04.992
<i>and that was the rectory</i>
<i>where Father Maskell lived.</i>

29:07.913 --> 29:09.333
[Tom] <i>She was his parishioner.</i>

29:09.414 --> 29:11.254
<i>The Maleckis lived two blocks</i>

29:11.333 --> 29:14.753
<i>from the rectory and church</i>
<i>where Maskell was.</i>

29:16.672 --> 29:18.802
[Darryl]
<i>We knew that the rectory was there.</i>

29:18.882 --> 29:21.302
<i>We knew Father Maskell was living there,</i>

29:21.843 --> 29:25.513
<i>and you would actually feel honored</i>
<i>being of the Catholic religion</i>

29:25.597 --> 29:27.927
to be that close to a priest.

29:30.269 --> 29:32.599
[Pat]
<i>The priest that they were investigating</i>

29:32.688 --> 29:34.608
<i>for Sister Catherine Cesnik's death,</i>

29:35.232 --> 29:36.192
<i>Priest Maskell,</i>

29:37.192 --> 29:42.412
sent my mother a sympathy card
when Joyce had her funeral.

29:44.408 --> 29:47.408
[Tom]
<i>No one, said the wise men of the FBI,</i>

29:47.494 --> 29:50.624
has ever made a connection
between Maskell and Malecki.

29:52.499 --> 29:58.549
Here's the card signed by Father Maskell
after Joyce Malecki is killed.

29:58.630 --> 30:00.300
She was two blocks from the rectory,

30:00.382 --> 30:03.932
she was going to Mass and confession,
and all the rest with Maskell,

30:04.303 --> 30:09.223
and, uh, if the FBI and its 4000 pages
of stuff doesn't have this, I'd--

30:09.308 --> 30:12.388
I'd feel even more disappointed in them
than I already am.

30:14.062 --> 30:17.982
[Abbie] <i>FBI had jurisdictions over</i>
<i>Joyce's death because her body was found</i>

30:18.066 --> 30:20.986
<i>in a wooded area</i>
<i>at Fort Meade Military Base.</i>

30:22.487 --> 30:25.027
<i>Tom Nugent had looked into it years ago,</i>

30:25.115 --> 30:28.035
<i>and he was told by the FBI</i>
<i>that they determined</i>

30:28.118 --> 30:31.658
<i>it didn't have anything to do with the,</i>
<i>you know, military or the government</i>

30:31.955 --> 30:33.955
<i>and so they didn't do an investigation.</i>

30:34.041 --> 30:36.461
<i>They had handed the case over</i>
<i>to Anne Arundel County.</i>

30:38.086 --> 30:42.966
<i>Anne Arundel County Police said,</i>
<i>"FBI never handed anything to us.</i>

30:43.050 --> 30:46.050
<i>We have no records, no case.</i>
<i>We never investigated anything."</i>

30:49.806 --> 30:53.976
Which left us saying,
did anybody investigate her murder?

30:55.395 --> 30:58.685
I've been pursuing this
for the last 15 years.

31:00.192 --> 31:04.782
<i>Once a year, cold cases are reviewed,</i>
<i>but nothing's been done.</i>

31:05.614 --> 31:07.324
<i>And my question is why?</i>

31:08.867 --> 31:12.947
I mean, I go to bed at night or I wake up
in the morning, and it's on my mind.

31:14.539 --> 31:15.789
<i>You know, who did this?</i>

31:15.874 --> 31:17.174
<i>It doesn't go away.</i>

31:22.881 --> 31:27.341
[Abbie] <i>I filed a Freedom</i>
<i>of Information Act request with the FBI,</i>

31:28.178 --> 31:33.388
<i>who confirmed they had about 4,000 pages</i>
<i>of documents on Joyce.</i>

31:34.309 --> 31:37.149
<i>It's been awaiting assignment</i>
<i>to someone to review.</i>

31:38.522 --> 31:43.112
Okay. So, in-- This was September 5th
of 2014 I sent it in.

31:44.611 --> 31:48.411
<i>I began writing them a letter</i>
<i>every four to six weeks saying,</i>

31:48.490 --> 31:49.740
<i>"Could you please update me</i>

31:49.825 --> 31:53.195
in terms of an anticipated delivery
of the documents?"

31:56.748 --> 31:57.708
<i>I naively thought,</i>

31:57.791 --> 31:59.751
<i>"Well, in six weeks, we'll have this."</i>

32:00.836 --> 32:02.666
<i>"The FBI's FOIA program</i>

32:02.754 --> 32:05.884
<i>has identified potential response</i>
<i>of information for your request</i>

32:06.341 --> 32:09.091
<i>and awaits assignment</i>
<i>to a government information specialist</i>

32:09.177 --> 32:10.427
<i>for further processing."</i>

32:13.181 --> 32:18.191
This one's from January 2015, so,
five months or so after we sent it.

32:18.687 --> 32:21.437
"Currently, your request
is in the perfected backlog

32:21.898 --> 32:24.358
where your request is awaiting
assignment to an analyst."

32:25.235 --> 32:27.275
<i>There's a requirement on the federal law,</i>

32:27.362 --> 32:30.032
<i>how long an agency has to reply</i>
<i>to your request,</i>

32:30.615 --> 32:32.825
but there is no law

32:32.909 --> 32:36.709
about how long they have
to actually send you the documents.

32:37.622 --> 32:39.122
[Don] <i>When it first happened,</i>

32:39.207 --> 32:40.627
<i>the FBI told us</i>

32:40.709 --> 32:43.209
<i>that they did find fingerprints</i>
<i>in the car,</i>

32:44.171 --> 32:46.341
but they said they didn't have a name
to attach it to.

32:46.923 --> 32:49.343
<i>They also said they had forensic evidence</i>

32:50.051 --> 32:53.051
<i>from her nails, where she apparently</i>
<i>put up a fight,</i>

32:53.138 --> 32:55.138
<i>but they didn't have anything to go on.</i>

32:55.640 --> 33:00.100
<i>And that was one of the questions I asked</i>
<i>about 15 years ago,</i>

33:01.438 --> 33:03.268
"If you've got fingerprints,

33:03.356 --> 33:06.486
have you run them through
the National Data Bank?"

33:07.110 --> 33:08.240
And they said no.

33:08.820 --> 33:13.280
I said, "Well, if you got forensic
evidence, have you done any DNA on it?"

33:13.700 --> 33:15.620
They said, "No." I asked, why?

33:16.203 --> 33:19.213
They said, "Two reasons,
budget and manpower."

33:20.123 --> 33:22.083
<i>And that's the excuse I was given,</i>

33:22.167 --> 33:23.497
<i>and led out the door.</i>

33:25.670 --> 33:27.630
[Abbie] <i>"Dear FOIA Officer,</i>
<i>this is a request</i>

33:27.714 --> 33:29.554
<i>under the Freedom of Information Act."</i>

33:31.259 --> 33:35.099
<i>This one is dated February 2016.</i>

33:35.805 --> 33:39.555
<i>"Thank you for your inquiry regarding</i>
<i>the status of your FOIA request.</i>

33:39.643 --> 33:44.063
The current estimated date of completion
for your request is April 2016."

33:45.899 --> 33:47.149
<i>Weeks went by.</i>

33:48.443 --> 33:50.863
<i>April came and went</i>
<i>and I never heard anything.</i>

33:52.906 --> 33:56.446
<i>I filed the original request</i>
<i>in August of 2014.</i>

33:56.535 --> 33:59.825
-Coming in two and a half years.
-Seems like a hundred years ago.

33:59.913 --> 34:03.333
[Abbie] <i>And two and a half years</i>
<i>and we have nothing.</i>

34:06.169 --> 34:09.589
<i>-The Maleckis feel like--</i>
-[Gemma] <i>They've been abandoned.</i>

34:10.172 --> 34:11.013
[Abbie] <i>Yeah.</i>

34:15.679 --> 34:19.018
[Darryl] <i>Our sister Joyce</i>
<i>was 20 years old,</i>

34:19.099 --> 34:21.018
<i>in the prime of her life,</i>

34:21.101 --> 34:23.650
<i>and her life</i>
<i>being snatched away from her,</i>

34:24.103 --> 34:26.774
<i>it's a crime and it needs</i>
<i>to be dealt with accordingly.</i>

34:27.940 --> 34:30.281
My parents have passed away,

34:30.360 --> 34:33.699
everybody is going to pass away
at some point in time.

34:33.780 --> 34:39.540
And when we pass away, then, they won't
have to hear from anybody ever again.

34:39.619 --> 34:42.869
They can put it in their cold case file

34:42.956 --> 34:44.616
and forget about it.

34:44.708 --> 34:45.958
Somebody should talk to us.

34:46.585 --> 34:49.085
If there's nothing, tell us that.

34:50.255 --> 34:54.465
<i>Just don't put us in a closet</i>
<i>and hope we go away one day.</i>

35:24.914 --> 35:26.584
[C.T.] <i>Thank you, Mr. Chair,</i>
<i>Madam Vice-Chair,</i>

35:26.666 --> 35:28.036
<i>members of the committee.</i>

35:29.294 --> 35:33.554
<i>This bill was, uh-- Been back and forth</i>
<i>in front of this body since about 2003.</i>

35:33.632 --> 35:34.472
For some reason,

35:34.549 --> 35:37.839
this bill has been interpreted to be
an attack on religious organizations

35:38.553 --> 35:40.433
and it's died repeatedly.

35:55.820 --> 35:58.030
People would ask, you know,
25 years, you know,

35:58.698 --> 36:00.198
they're grown people, right?

36:00.283 --> 36:04.293
I was in combat, I was out of military by
the time I was 25, I'd served eight years.

36:06.956 --> 36:09.536
Well, the problem
with this is suppression.

36:09.626 --> 36:12.086
People don't wanna acknowledge
that it happened.

36:12.170 --> 36:15.760
<i>You've learned to live with the lie</i>
<i>as a child, so you can live as an adult.</i>

36:17.884 --> 36:20.304
<i>Growing up, I was in foster homes</i>

36:20.387 --> 36:22.137
<i>and I was adopted at some point</i>

36:22.514 --> 36:23.774
<i>by Tom and Millie Wilson.</i>

36:25.058 --> 36:25.888
He was a, uh--

36:26.393 --> 36:29.193
He was a school teacher, you know,
a Sunday school teacher,

36:29.270 --> 36:31.230
a Cub Scout leader,
and he was a pedophile.

36:31.564 --> 36:35.494
And so from, like, the ages
of eight or nine until about 16,

36:36.027 --> 36:37.397
I endured a lot.

36:39.239 --> 36:42.159
[Teresa] <i>Why do we wait so long</i>
<i>to come forward?</i>

36:42.826 --> 36:45.196
I was 40 years old when I came forward.

36:45.286 --> 36:47.866
It took me that amount of time

36:47.956 --> 36:51.536
to focus my life
and make something of myself.

36:52.127 --> 36:53.287
I'm 80 years old.

36:53.795 --> 36:55.125
[sobbing]

36:57.632 --> 37:00.012
Anyway, I could have been
a much better father

37:00.885 --> 37:03.425
and a much better...

37:03.513 --> 37:07.603
husband, but anyway,
it affected me a great deal.

37:07.684 --> 37:09.274
I want you all to think about something.

37:09.352 --> 37:12.192
Everybody has a secret
that they don't want to admit.

37:13.565 --> 37:16.355
Come up here and stand up here,
and admit it to everybody,

37:16.443 --> 37:18.493
because that's what you're asking me to do

37:18.570 --> 37:21.030
and that's what you're asking
a 25-year-old to do.

37:21.114 --> 37:24.414
You're asking them to take
the deepest, darkest secret they have

37:24.743 --> 37:27.293
and stand up in front of a jury,
and tell them.

37:27.871 --> 37:31.171
I can testify that there are many victims

37:31.249 --> 37:33.169
that were abused by Maskell

37:33.251 --> 37:35.841
who have not even begun to live.

37:35.920 --> 37:38.630
They live in quiet solitude.

37:39.299 --> 37:42.639
I ask you to please pass this bill.
Thank you.

37:42.969 --> 37:45.509
Thank you very much for your testimony.
Thank you.

37:46.264 --> 37:49.604
[man] All right. Uh... Now we're turning
to the opposition, Mr. Murphy?

37:50.185 --> 37:52.265
[Murphy] My name is Kevin Murphy.
I'm an attorney.

37:52.854 --> 37:56.154
I was asked by the Maryland
Catholic Conference to testify

37:56.232 --> 38:00.742
because I've been involved in many,
many cases, uh, involving...

38:00.820 --> 38:02.570
[C.T.] <i>I was surprised</i>
<i>that the Catholic Church</i>

38:02.655 --> 38:03.985
<i>was coming out against this.</i>

38:04.073 --> 38:06.953
This wasn't me against the Church,
it's what it's turned into.

38:07.786 --> 38:09.076
[Murphy] Statute of limitations,

38:09.162 --> 38:11.622
they spare the courts
from litigation of stale claims

38:11.706 --> 38:13.366
and they spare the citizen

38:13.458 --> 38:16.958
from being put to his defense
after memories have faded,

38:17.921 --> 38:21.801
witnesses have died or disappeared,
and the evidence has been lost.

38:22.842 --> 38:26.052
[Teresa] <i>When I sat there and watched</i>
<i>Kevin Murphy talk,</i>

38:26.346 --> 38:30.306
<i>he did bring back memories</i>
<i>in the Doe-Roe-Maskell case,</i>

38:30.683 --> 38:33.483
<i>interrogating me back in '94.</i>

38:34.062 --> 38:38.072
<i>And today, he stands up there speaking</i>
<i>as though he really cares</i>

38:38.149 --> 38:41.029
about people that are abused.

38:42.654 --> 38:45.034
[Raskin] Are there any other values

38:45.114 --> 38:47.124
that you think
the statute of limitations serves

38:47.200 --> 38:49.370
other than for the weakness
of human memory?

38:49.953 --> 38:52.293
[Murphy] Seven years is not a short
statute of limitations.

38:52.372 --> 38:56.882
It's a pretty long statute of limitations,
but it protects from the alleged abuser

38:56.960 --> 38:59.630
continuing to abuse for the next 13 years.

38:59.712 --> 39:04.052
If you change the statute, 13 years can
go by before the person comes forward.

39:04.551 --> 39:06.141
[C.T.] <i> I stepped out at that point</i>

39:06.219 --> 39:07.889
because I knew I was gonna be angry.

39:08.596 --> 39:11.386
How dare them say something so arrogant,

39:11.641 --> 39:15.231
so transparently self-serving

39:15.478 --> 39:19.318
as, "Well, the victims, they-- We need
to pressure them to come forward."

39:19.482 --> 39:20.652
Do you really?

39:22.610 --> 39:25.450
[Alison] <i>I am opposed to Senate Bill 68</i>
<i>because I believe</i>

39:25.530 --> 39:30.870
our focus must be on providing outreach
to survivors of child sexual abuse

39:31.119 --> 39:33.709
and preventing child sexual abuse
from occurring.

39:34.497 --> 39:36.667
I understand that there may be reasons

39:36.749 --> 39:39.339
that a survivor is not inclined
to come forward earlier,

39:39.419 --> 39:42.709
but the reality is that the perpetrator
often remains in a position

39:42.797 --> 39:45.927
of close access to children
until an allegation is reported

39:46.009 --> 39:48.259
to the civil authorities and the employer.

39:49.220 --> 39:51.310
[C.T.] <i>They make it seem</i>
<i>like it's the victim's fault,</i>

39:51.389 --> 39:53.929
<i>that if the victim doesn't step up</i>
<i>by the age of 25,</i>

39:54.517 --> 39:55.887
<i>then they're the ones--</i>

39:56.436 --> 39:57.726
<i>They're the ones to blame.</i>

39:59.063 --> 40:01.113
<i>Now, that's every abuser's line, isn't it?</i>

40:01.691 --> 40:04.691
"This is your fault."
I don't need anybody to remind me

40:04.777 --> 40:07.987
that me not speaking up
may have caused a lot of other victims.

40:08.865 --> 40:09.695
Yeah.

40:10.450 --> 40:11.830
That's utterly disgusting.

40:12.493 --> 40:15.373
We have also reached settlement
agreements with many survivors,

40:15.455 --> 40:19.625
even though their claims are time-barred
and we have no legal obligation to do so.

40:20.209 --> 40:21.039
Thank you.

40:21.336 --> 40:22.666
[Raskin] Thank you for your testimony.

40:22.754 --> 40:25.264
That concludes the hearing
on Senate Bill 668.

40:25.423 --> 40:27.223
That concludes the hearings for today.

40:31.596 --> 40:34.966
[C.T] Good morning.
I'm here to file some bills.

40:38.144 --> 40:40.524
<i>A bill can die without ever being voted on</i>

40:40.605 --> 40:43.185
<i>because the chairman says so.</i>

40:44.192 --> 40:46.572
This is gonna end up costing me
my political career.

40:46.653 --> 40:50.163
This interview might be the end
of me being a delegate, pretty sure.

40:54.035 --> 40:56.865
<i>I'll tell you that Senator Mike Miller,</i>
<i>who runs the Senate,</i>

40:56.955 --> 40:59.665
<i>and Delegate Vallario,</i>
<i>do not let this bill come to a vote,</i>

40:59.749 --> 41:02.419
<i>because they know if it came to a vote,</i>
<i>it would pass.</i>

41:04.420 --> 41:07.300
I mean, I know because
I've been told, specifically.

41:07.382 --> 41:08.382
Joe has told me

41:08.466 --> 41:10.796
<i>the Church has contacted him</i>
<i>and said this bill can't pass.</i>

41:14.889 --> 41:16.269
<i>They don't want that bill out,</i>

41:17.058 --> 41:19.098
<i>so it doesn't get a vote.</i>

41:21.521 --> 41:24.821
<i>Beyond the old separation of church</i>
<i>and state doctrine,</i>

41:26.943 --> 41:30.243
there should be something about this
that has you go, "Wait a minute."

41:52.927 --> 41:56.717
Stories of abuse coming from people who
attended a Baltimore Catholic high school.

41:56.806 --> 41:59.726
The archdiocese now paying those victims.

41:59.809 --> 42:04.399
This all centers on a priest who died
in 2001, Father Joseph Maskell.

42:04.731 --> 42:07.981
[woman] <i>Now, at least a dozen victims</i>
<i>have just received settlements</i>

42:08.067 --> 42:10.107
<i>from the Archdiocese of Baltimore.</i>

42:10.194 --> 42:12.244
Our desire would be that it never
happened to begin with

42:12.321 --> 42:14.281
but short of being able to undo that,

42:14.365 --> 42:16.775
uh, the best we can do
is try to bring them some healing.

42:19.829 --> 42:21.369
[C.T.]
<i>When you're trying to make your life</i>

42:21.456 --> 42:23.116
<i>and your suffering mean something,</i>

42:23.207 --> 42:26.747
<i>but it's after the age of the statute</i>
<i>of limitations has been passed,</i>

42:27.420 --> 42:30.970
sometimes the only the thing you see
that you have left is mediation...

42:32.467 --> 42:35.257
<i>because you have been told you</i>
<i>can't go through the court,</i>

42:35.344 --> 42:37.854
<i>you can stand on the street corner</i>
<i>and wave out a sign,</i>

42:37.930 --> 42:41.390
<i>you're not gonna change anything,</i>
<i>so at least come in and talk to us.</i>

42:41.726 --> 42:43.516
<i>"We'll offer you something."</i>

43:05.041 --> 43:08.541
[Jean]
<i>I still have a hard time to, um, come here</i>

43:08.628 --> 43:11.008
<i>and be anywhere near</i>
<i>the archdiocese.</i>

43:12.465 --> 43:14.255
<i>I hope that you really don't think</i>

43:14.675 --> 43:17.635
<i>that the survivors of Joseph Maskell,</i>

43:17.720 --> 43:19.010
<i>at the ages we are,</i>

43:19.722 --> 43:21.062
<i>are really coming here</i>

43:21.641 --> 43:26.601
<i>for the little bit of compensation</i>
<i>that you're giving.</i>

43:28.231 --> 43:30.401
<i>But having the opportunity</i>
<i>to say these things,</i>

43:30.483 --> 43:32.283
<i>it's more important to me</i>

43:32.735 --> 43:38.195
<i>than, um, anything else</i>
<i>that pertains to the archdiocese.</i>

43:41.077 --> 43:42.407
<i>How this impacted on me?</i>

43:45.039 --> 43:46.079
<i>I live small.</i>

43:48.334 --> 43:50.924
<i>I can't go out beyond my boundaries.</i>

43:54.340 --> 43:57.180
<i>The archdiocese had an opportunity...</i>

43:58.553 --> 44:01.393
<i>back in 1992, '93, '94,</i>

44:02.640 --> 44:03.890
<i>to do the right thing</i>

44:04.642 --> 44:08.442
<i>and to help not just me, but,</i>
<i>I am sure, many other Catholics,</i>

44:09.605 --> 44:12.685
<i>to know that they were not alone.</i>

44:13.734 --> 44:14.744
<i>And instead...</i>

44:16.028 --> 44:17.698
<i>I still feel very alone.</i>

44:19.323 --> 44:23.373
The fact the Catholic Church has taken on
the role as not only being the abuser

44:23.452 --> 44:26.502
but also the savior, it's a dichotomy.
They can't explain it.

44:26.581 --> 44:29.001
<i>You can't-- You cannot lay those</i>
<i>side-by-side.</i>

44:31.002 --> 44:33.672
<i>It can't be them to solve this problem,</i>

44:34.005 --> 44:36.295
<i>it must be the government that intercedes.</i>

44:37.592 --> 44:39.142
<i>Whether you believe in little government</i>
<i>or bigger,</i>

44:39.218 --> 44:41.258
<i>you must understand</i>
<i>that we do have a role.</i>

44:42.430 --> 44:46.270
<i>We're the ones that make sure that</i>
<i>the citizens at large are taken care of.</i>

44:47.310 --> 44:50.650
<i>It is only the government that can step up</i>
<i>and hold them accountable.</i>

45:20.176 --> 45:23.046
Come here, you little razzmatazz.
Over here.

45:25.848 --> 45:29.188
You little rascal, come on,
you got company. We got company. Get--

45:29.268 --> 45:30.268
[chuckles]

45:32.521 --> 45:33.731
Come on, you rascal.

45:34.899 --> 45:36.649
<i>Man, if I'm gonna show you that--</i>

45:37.693 --> 45:39.953
That's me, that's my brother.

45:40.488 --> 45:42.868
We were both going to St. Clement's
at the time.

45:43.866 --> 45:45.406
Again, I was the golden boy.

45:46.744 --> 45:50.084
You know, that meant my shit didn't stink,
uh, is what it meant.

45:52.166 --> 45:53.746
<i>Now, where I made the mistake</i>

45:54.418 --> 45:56.548
<i>was I told some of my friends,</i>

45:56.629 --> 45:58.379
<i>"You gotta watch Father Maskell."</i>

45:59.090 --> 46:01.300
I didn't want the same thing
to happen to them.

46:05.262 --> 46:07.062
<i>And he just walked into the classroom.</i>

46:08.975 --> 46:09.975
<i>Came over to me</i>

46:10.059 --> 46:12.809
and he grabbed me by my hair
and I'm telling you,

46:12.895 --> 46:14.935
I thought he was gonna pull my hair
out my head.

46:15.064 --> 46:16.984
<i>He lifted me right out of that chair...</i>

46:18.275 --> 46:20.645
<i>and said, "I wanna see your ass</i>
<i>in the rectory now."</i>

46:22.446 --> 46:24.656
<i>And he says,</i>
<i>"Listen, you little motherfucker.</i>

46:26.242 --> 46:27.832
If I hear one more thing...

46:29.370 --> 46:30.960
about you talking about me,

46:31.288 --> 46:33.208
I'm gonna make sure you don't graduate."

46:36.711 --> 46:38.671
<i>He started making my life miserable.</i>

46:39.422 --> 46:42.472
<i>Tossed me off the basketball team,</i>
<i>tossed me off the baseball team.</i>

46:42.550 --> 46:44.090
<i>So, I was kicked out of CYO.</i>

46:45.428 --> 46:48.058
I was-- I wasn't a golden boy anymore.

46:51.225 --> 46:53.015
<i>I-- I now was in over my head.</i>

46:57.064 --> 46:58.734
<i>I had to go home and tell my mother.</i>

46:59.400 --> 47:01.070
<i>I had to go home and tell my mother.</i>

47:02.737 --> 47:06.407
<i>And my mother, she wasn't one to</i>
<i>be fooled with, especially with the kids.</i>

47:06.741 --> 47:08.701
<i>You know, "Don't go messing with my kids."</i>

47:09.493 --> 47:11.083
And this is for a fact,

47:11.912 --> 47:14.502
I know, in May of '67,

47:15.332 --> 47:18.002
the Archdiocese of Baltimore became aware

47:18.627 --> 47:20.247
<i>they had a sickie on their hands...</i>

47:22.256 --> 47:25.716
<i>because my mother went down</i>
<i>to the archdiocese,</i>

47:26.427 --> 47:27.427
<i>straight to the top.</i>

47:29.972 --> 47:33.852
<i>"Father Maskell is abusing</i>
<i>my eighth grade son."</i>

47:37.396 --> 47:38.936
<i>A day or two later</i>

47:39.023 --> 47:42.403
<i>I get a phone call from the pastor</i>
<i>of St. Clement's, Father Collopy.</i>

47:43.194 --> 47:45.204
And I can remember this conversation.

47:45.738 --> 47:49.488
He got on the phone and said,
"Charlie, listen. I'm just calling.

47:49.575 --> 47:51.075
You're back in the CYO.

47:51.660 --> 47:53.500
<i>You're back on the baseball team.</i>

47:53.954 --> 47:56.714
<i>Father Maskell is no longer here</i>
<i>at St. Clements,</i>

47:57.124 --> 47:58.334
<i>he's been transferred."</i>

48:02.129 --> 48:04.509
<i>So, they transferred Maskell to Keough.</i>

48:09.553 --> 48:13.523
[man] So, I wanted to tell you
a little bit about Charles Franz.

48:13.599 --> 48:16.019
-You know who that is?
-Mm, say. Tell me.

48:16.102 --> 48:18.692
He was a boy at St. Clement's,
Maskell was abusing him.

48:18.771 --> 48:21.021
-Okay.
-So, he went home and he told his mom

48:21.107 --> 48:26.317
and says, "I know in May of 1967,
my mom went down to the archdiocese and--"

48:26.403 --> 48:27.993
-1967?
-Yeah.

48:28.072 --> 48:30.832
That it led to disciplinary action
on Maskell,

48:30.908 --> 48:33.828
and Maskell being sent from St. Clement's
to Archbishop Keough.

48:33.911 --> 48:37.621
-Wow.
-And then particularly relevant to you

48:37.706 --> 48:42.456
is something Charles told us
happened in the 1990s.

48:46.006 --> 48:48.586
[Charles]
<i>I'll tell you the story in the '90s.</i>

48:50.845 --> 48:52.135
<i>I was a practicing dentist.</i>

48:53.848 --> 48:56.388
<i>One day, a lady comes in as a patient.</i>

48:58.936 --> 49:01.646
She says, "The archdiocese
is trying to get a hold of you."

49:01.730 --> 49:02.730
I said, "What?"

49:03.858 --> 49:06.938
<i>Evidently, there was a couple ladies</i>
<i>from Keough</i>

49:08.070 --> 49:10.240
<i>who were suing the Catholic Church.</i>

49:13.576 --> 49:15.996
<i>And so we arranged a meeting</i>

49:16.787 --> 49:18.327
<i>and we met at my office.</i>

49:19.206 --> 49:20.786
<i>And it was myself and my wife...</i>

49:21.834 --> 49:23.714
<i>two canon lawyers,</i>

49:24.837 --> 49:28.217
<i>plus a priest, Monsignor Malooly.</i>

49:30.342 --> 49:33.722
He started off with this, he said,
"I appreciate you meeting with us.

49:34.054 --> 49:35.854
Let me tell you how important this is.

49:37.725 --> 49:39.685
If Archbishop Keeler

49:40.311 --> 49:41.561
<i>was not in Rome...</i>

49:42.897 --> 49:45.817
<i>he'd be here. He'd be here tonight."</i>

49:48.068 --> 49:51.778
<i>And we had-- I bet you it was a two,</i>
<i>two-and-a-half-hour conversation</i>

49:52.907 --> 49:54.827
<i>about Father Maskell.</i>

49:55.910 --> 49:58.500
I hate to say Father
'cause he really wasn't a father.

49:59.538 --> 50:02.118
<i>You know, I--</i>
<i>And they were very interested in the story</i>

50:02.208 --> 50:05.418
and I told them about Maskell
being transferred, and they knew it all.

50:05.753 --> 50:06.803
They knew it all.

50:08.047 --> 50:10.297
And then at the end...

50:12.968 --> 50:16.218
Monsignor Malooly says to me...

50:17.348 --> 50:18.928
"Well, what do you want, Charlie?"

50:19.767 --> 50:21.057
I said, "Excuse me, Father?"

50:21.769 --> 50:24.559
He said, "What do you want?
You want a boat?"

50:27.900 --> 50:29.030
"Do I want a boat?

50:31.070 --> 50:33.950
No, I don't want a boat.
In fact, I got three boats."

50:34.573 --> 50:35.953
'Cause I had three boats. Heh.

50:36.992 --> 50:40.202
And then I said, "Father,
I didn't ask you to come here.

50:41.956 --> 50:44.826
You asked me to come here.
You know, I-- I--

50:45.334 --> 50:49.174
I didn't know anything about this.
I don't want a boat. I'll tell you what.

50:50.005 --> 50:51.045
What I would--

50:52.967 --> 50:56.047
Would like to see, just do what's right.

50:57.137 --> 50:58.387
Just do what's right."

51:00.349 --> 51:03.639
<i>We left, with you know,</i>
<i>"Perhaps we'll get together again," and--</i>

51:04.228 --> 51:06.018
<i>And I never heard from him again.</i>

51:07.523 --> 51:10.033
Un-freaking-believable.

51:14.571 --> 51:16.621
<i>This Monsignor Malooly...</i>

51:19.368 --> 51:20.908
<i>back in '93,</i>

51:21.704 --> 51:26.544
<i>when the family and the friends sent out</i>
<i>letters to everybody anonymously,</i>

51:26.625 --> 51:28.415
<i>um, put an ad in a paper.</i>

51:29.378 --> 51:34.798
<i>Well, one of the letters that came through</i>
<i>was a letter from the archdiocese.</i>

51:35.843 --> 51:38.303
<i>"To the extent you obtain any information,</i>

51:38.387 --> 51:41.637
<i>it is my sincere hope</i>
<i>that you will advise me</i>

51:41.724 --> 51:44.854
<i>so that appropriate action</i>
<i>may be taken by the archdiocese</i>

51:44.935 --> 51:47.765
<i>to protect individuals</i>
<i>from potential harm."</i>

51:49.732 --> 51:52.322
<i>From Monsignor Francis Malooly.</i>

51:53.485 --> 51:55.525
<i>That was the guy who wrote that letter?</i>

51:57.573 --> 51:58.493
Wow.

51:59.992 --> 52:01.662
Those fuckers!

52:01.744 --> 52:02.624
[laughs]

52:02.703 --> 52:04.293
My God!

52:05.122 --> 52:08.172
See, see how do you--? I--

52:13.464 --> 52:15.094
<i>I don't know Charles...</i>

52:16.800 --> 52:20.010
but he is a legitimate corroboration
for me.

52:22.348 --> 52:23.848
I had the letters from

52:24.433 --> 52:28.773
<i>Richard Way saying, you know,</i>
<i>"We can't corroborate any of this.</i>

52:28.854 --> 52:30.564
<i>It's all about corroboration."</i>

52:31.482 --> 52:34.692
<i>Corroboration, corroboration,</i>
<i>corroboration.</i>

52:36.278 --> 52:39.948
<i>"Have somebody come forward who says</i>
<i>that they know that this really happened."</i>

52:44.244 --> 52:45.834
And they had somebody right there.

52:48.457 --> 52:49.287
Amazing.

53:07.768 --> 53:11.188
[man] We've asked for the archdiocese
to participate, to go on camera

53:11.271 --> 53:13.731
and give us their version
of the story of Maskell.

53:13.816 --> 53:18.236
Every time, they denied something
on camera and, uh--

53:18.570 --> 53:20.320
And so what they did agree to

53:20.406 --> 53:25.076
was to give us written responses
to written--

53:25.160 --> 53:26.160
Questions.

53:26.662 --> 53:29.832
So, we finally got the responses
from them.

53:29.915 --> 53:33.375
Well, before we-- Let me preface this.
Am I gonna be pissed off here?

53:33.836 --> 53:34.666
I don't know.

53:35.129 --> 53:36.919
[chuckles] Okay, okay.

53:39.633 --> 53:42.933
-[man] So, we asked them questions.
-Okay.

53:43.011 --> 53:46.891
So, I'll read them to you as the numbers,
and then I'll read you the answers.

53:46.974 --> 53:48.894
-Okay.
-So, question number one.

53:50.811 --> 53:53.981
<i>"Was Jane Doe, Jean Wehner,</i>
<i>the first person to come forward</i>

53:54.064 --> 53:57.234
<i>with allegations of abuse</i>
<i>against Father Maskell?"</i>

53:59.695 --> 54:02.065
The archdiocese's answer: "Yes.

54:02.156 --> 54:06.236
Archdiocesan files do not reflect any
kind of abuse allegation against Maskell

54:06.326 --> 54:09.326
before Jane Doe came forward in 1992."

54:12.207 --> 54:13.127
[Charles] <i>That's a shame.</i>

54:13.709 --> 54:14.539
That's a shame.

54:14.960 --> 54:16.000
[man] Question number two.

54:17.421 --> 54:22.091
<i>"How and when did the Archdiocese</i>
<i>first hear allegations of abuse</i>

54:22.176 --> 54:23.796
<i>against Father Maskell?"</i>

54:24.678 --> 54:26.388
The archdiocese's answer:

54:27.097 --> 54:28.967
"See answer to number one."

54:29.892 --> 54:30.772
Hmm.

54:33.228 --> 54:34.058
They're lying.

54:35.272 --> 54:36.192
They're lying.

54:36.273 --> 54:38.573
Of course there was allegations.

54:40.068 --> 54:41.318
[man] Question number three.

54:42.070 --> 54:48.080
<i>"Were any disciplinary interventions made</i>
<i>against Father Maskell prior to 1992?"</i>

54:51.079 --> 54:53.079
The archdiocese's answer: "No."

54:53.999 --> 54:55.329
That's it, just "no"?

54:58.754 --> 55:00.134
<i>This is disgusting.</i>

55:01.632 --> 55:02.842
This is disgusting.

55:05.302 --> 55:08.142
He's saying nothing happened before me,

55:08.847 --> 55:10.347
so-- And Charles is saying,

55:10.432 --> 55:12.062
<i>"Oh, no, definitely, it did."</i>

55:14.353 --> 55:18.573
If you start saying things like,
"That never happened."

55:20.192 --> 55:22.532
What you're calling me is a liar.

55:25.405 --> 55:27.615
<i>How about the meeting with Malooly?</i>

55:28.784 --> 55:29.954
<i>What did that concern?</i>

55:33.664 --> 55:35.124
I'd love to hear the answer.

55:37.626 --> 55:41.126
<i>They knew my mother contacted</i>
<i>the Archdiocese of Baltimore.</i>

55:42.047 --> 55:45.427
<i>They knew why Maskell</i>
<i>was asked to leave St. Clement's</i>

55:45.509 --> 55:49.009
<i>in May of '67 and put at Keough.</i>

55:49.721 --> 55:50.601
<i>They knew that.</i>

55:53.850 --> 55:57.900
I guess that, you know, buddy,
there are lies and there are lies, okay?

55:58.522 --> 56:00.232
You wanna deal with that bullshit,

56:00.983 --> 56:03.943
you might be able to get away with it,
okay?

56:04.027 --> 56:04.947
And that's a lie.

56:06.280 --> 56:07.110
[Jean] Man.

56:08.991 --> 56:10.121
I'm telling you...

56:11.535 --> 56:15.455
and especially right after I finished up
this damn mediation

56:15.914 --> 56:19.634
and they pick and pull
with every little tiny penny--

56:19.710 --> 56:21.840
And they act like what you went through,

56:21.920 --> 56:25.010
they care about,
and they could give two shits, really.

56:25.799 --> 56:27.509
And some part of this

56:27.593 --> 56:32.313
is really squelching people's anger,

56:32.389 --> 56:34.849
and people's righteous anger,

56:34.933 --> 56:38.523
and people's need for you
to make things public

56:38.604 --> 56:40.404
and stop acting like it's--

56:43.817 --> 56:46.357
That-- That we're invisible.
We're not invisible.

57:25.275 --> 57:26.395
[Abbie] Okay, here's the letter.

57:27.235 --> 57:29.355
"Dear Seton Keough Alumnae and Friends,

57:29.696 --> 57:32.946
it is with a heavy heart that I sit
and write this November message.

57:33.533 --> 57:37.623
As I am sure you have heard, Seton Keough
will be closing its doors in June."

57:40.374 --> 57:42.424
<i>Many Keough graduates</i>

57:42.501 --> 57:45.711
<i>are glad to see the circle closed,</i>
<i>the doors shut.</i>

57:47.130 --> 57:49.090
<i>This piece of history destroyed.</i>

57:53.720 --> 57:58.230
<i>I wasn't particularly a conspiracy</i>
<i>theorist, as I think of it, at first.</i>

57:58.308 --> 58:00.438
<i>I was just interested in who hurt Cathy.</i>

58:01.478 --> 58:06.818
<i>But the abuse angle of this just took off</i>
<i>running and grew and grew and grew.</i>

58:08.318 --> 58:10.818
<i>I share the pain of my classmates,</i>

58:10.904 --> 58:13.784
<i>who lived through some horrendous years.</i>

58:16.618 --> 58:18.748
At night when I can't sleep and I--

58:18.829 --> 58:22.499
I say, "If I think about this a little
harder, I can figure this out,"

58:22.582 --> 58:23.672
um, at 3 a.m.

58:25.460 --> 58:26.840
<i>It seems like</i>

58:27.587 --> 58:32.377
<i>even when I try to look at her murder</i>
<i>as the work of a random lone wolf,</i>

58:33.051 --> 58:35.351
<i>the abuse issues always come back in.</i>

58:48.066 --> 58:49.436
How are you?

58:49.985 --> 58:51.895
-I'm so happy to see you.

[Gemma] <i>Jane Doe was led to believe</i>
<i>that she was the only one.</i>

58:57.659 --> 59:01.289
If Maskell had been nailed

59:01.705 --> 59:05.285
the first time the abuse was reported,

59:05.834 --> 59:10.844
then how do we even know
how many people could have been saved?

59:11.423 --> 59:14.263
<i>I personally know of 35 names</i>

59:14.509 --> 59:17.549
<i>of abuse victims of Joseph Maskell.</i>

59:17.929 --> 59:20.019
<i>Some aren't even living anymore.</i>

59:20.390 --> 59:24.690
<i>There were suicides,</i>
<i>alcoholism, drug addiction.</i>

59:28.023 --> 59:31.693
<i>And what happened to them set their fate.</i>

59:33.862 --> 59:35.032
<i>If somebody...</i>

59:36.198 --> 59:37.488
<i>had listened...</i>

59:39.367 --> 59:42.577
<i>how many other lives could've been saved?</i>

59:49.461 --> 59:50.921
<i>Cathy would be here.</i>

59:55.675 --> 59:57.385
She would still be here.

01:00:08.021 --> 01:00:10.481
[Marilyn] "<i>Some people meet death</i>
<i>With open arms</i>

01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:13.778
<i>And thank God their time has come</i>

01:00:14.694 --> 01:00:17.534
<i>Others beg to be spared</i>
<i>For just one more day</i>

01:00:18.365 --> 01:00:20.275
<i>Saying there's much to be done</i>

01:00:22.661 --> 01:00:26.711
<i>But if we, before performing an act</i>
<i>Would stop and think of death</i>

01:00:28.708 --> 01:00:33.668
<i>Of death, of judgment</i>
<i>And of all such things</i>

01:00:35.423 --> 01:00:37.513
<i>I'm sure we would do our best</i>

01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:43.306
<i>So that when our time comes, we may say:</i>

01:00:45.183 --> 01:00:47.393
<i>'Take me, Lord, without delay'"</i>

01:00:51.064 --> 01:00:52.024
She was 16...

01:00:53.191 --> 01:00:54.481
<i>when she wrote that poem.</i>

01:00:57.529 --> 01:00:58.989
<i>Cathy's life,</i>

01:00:59.573 --> 01:01:01.453
Cathy's death and this abuse...

01:01:02.826 --> 01:01:04.616
<i>this is all connected.</i>

01:01:07.956 --> 01:01:10.626
<i>These girls have lived</i>
<i>with this all of their life.</i>

01:01:11.459 --> 01:01:14.299
I've lived with the loss of-- Of--

01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:18.840
My best friend, my sister,
all my life and I will carry that.

01:01:19.217 --> 01:01:21.677
But they also have pain they are carrying.

01:01:23.096 --> 01:01:25.716
And there needs to be a world,

01:01:25.807 --> 01:01:28.057
there needs to be a place that we live in,

01:01:28.143 --> 01:01:31.063
where people wanna see something
done about that.

01:01:36.568 --> 01:01:40.028
[Abbie] <i>Whoever murdered her</i>
<i>has gotten away with it,</i>

01:01:41.448 --> 01:01:42.278
<i>and...</i>

01:01:44.367 --> 01:01:48.367
she's never gotten a bit of justice.

01:01:50.957 --> 01:01:53.837
[Gemma] <i>It has been almost 50 years,</i>

01:01:54.211 --> 01:01:56.131
<i>since Cathy's murder,</i>

01:01:57.214 --> 01:02:00.014
<i>but I do think it'll be solved.</i>

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:03.505
I won't rest.

01:02:04.763 --> 01:02:05.763
Mm-mm.

01:02:10.810 --> 01:02:12.980
[Jean] <i>Can we find justice?</i>

01:02:14.689 --> 01:02:18.819
Can justice just be acknowledged
from the community

01:02:18.902 --> 01:02:21.912
instead of waiting
for the stamp of approval

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:27.120
from the systems
that we usually get it from?

01:02:29.287 --> 01:02:31.367
[C.T.] <i>That's what the state</i>
<i>is supposed to be doing.</i>

01:02:32.082 --> 01:02:33.792
We can't have you be un-robbed...

01:02:34.876 --> 01:02:38.206
or un-raped or un-shot.

01:02:38.797 --> 01:02:40.377
<i>We can't un-ring those bells.</i>

01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:43.594
<i>What we can do is hold people accountable.</i>

01:02:58.608 --> 01:03:00.568
[Jean] <i>For many, many, many years,</i>

01:03:01.444 --> 01:03:02.864
<i>I didn't remember anything,</i>

01:03:03.446 --> 01:03:07.736
and one of the first things that I started
remembering was Cathy Cesnik.

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:13.420
<i>This woman, she died</i>

01:03:13.498 --> 01:03:16.128
<i>to help stop what was going on</i>
<i>over there.</i>

01:03:18.336 --> 01:03:19.706
And because of the

01:03:19.796 --> 01:03:23.676
<i>Justice for Cathy group,</i>
<i>because of Cathy's sister,</i>

01:03:24.384 --> 01:03:28.184
<i>um, having the courage to come into this</i>

01:03:28.263 --> 01:03:32.603
to ask questions and to kind of
find her own peace,

01:03:34.019 --> 01:03:37.109
I'm finding another layer of that closure

01:03:37.522 --> 01:03:39.942
where I can say, "Okay."

01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:45.032
<i>You can't bury the truth so deep</i>
<i>it doesn't come up.</i>

01:03:54.748 --> 01:03:55.668
I'm ready.

01:04:03.423 --> 01:04:07.013
<i>If I could speak for myself</i>
<i>and maybe others,</i>

01:04:08.303 --> 01:04:09.933
<i>this is the opportunity.</i>

01:04:11.639 --> 01:04:13.219
It's like a little crack...

01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:18.191
and I personally feel that what I'm doing,

01:04:18.646 --> 01:04:21.896
facing my fear, is coming up to the crack
and saying,

01:04:21.983 --> 01:04:25.703
"Hello, do you know we're here?

01:04:26.112 --> 01:04:28.032
Is anyone out there?"

01:04:32.494 --> 01:04:34.124
And it's still silent.

01:04:35.413 --> 01:04:36.873
<i>But we're hearing each other...</i>

01:04:38.041 --> 01:04:40.171
<i>because we're all coming up to the crack.</i>

01:04:41.294 --> 01:04:43.254
<i>And what's happening is,</i>

01:04:43.338 --> 01:04:45.168
<i>is we're bumping into each other,</i>

01:04:45.715 --> 01:04:47.085
<i>coming to the crack.</i>

01:04:48.468 --> 01:04:52.008
And before you know it,
the pressure of that voice

01:04:53.139 --> 01:04:57.939
seeping through the crack
is going to shatter it.
