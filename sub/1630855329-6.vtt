00:13.622 --> 00:15.058
[The Dama] Previously on
Dead City...

00:15.189 --> 00:16.929
I help you,
and no more of this

00:17.060 --> 00:19.584
dragging me back to
New Babylon bullshit.

00:19.715 --> 00:22.065
When this is over, will
you look after Ginny for me?

00:22.196 --> 00:23.414
You're trying
to go after Negan?

00:23.545 --> 00:24.763
What do you think
he's wanted for?

00:24.894 --> 00:26.200
Stealing a loaf of bread?

00:26.330 --> 00:28.071
-[walkers growling]
-Go, Ginny, go!

00:30.160 --> 00:31.727
-Hershel!
-Mom!

00:31.857 --> 00:33.294
[Maggie] Negan is the
key to getting him back.

00:33.424 --> 00:35.774
He's on the island.
I saw him.

00:35.905 --> 00:37.733
[The Dama] Where is he?

00:37.863 --> 00:41.519
There is absolutely no way Negan
will be getting off this island.

00:43.869 --> 00:49.701
[tense, pulsating music]

01:00.756 --> 01:03.498
[music mellows]

01:03.628 --> 01:05.935
Maggie? Maggie!

01:06.066 --> 01:08.111
[whistles from distance]

01:31.743 --> 01:34.311
What are you doin' here?
How the hell did you get here?

01:34.442 --> 01:37.314
[Maggie] Ginny! Ginny!

01:41.536 --> 01:44.277
-You know about this?
-No.

01:44.408 --> 01:46.280
She just turned up at the arena,

01:46.410 --> 01:47.759
right before the walkers came,
and--

01:47.890 --> 01:50.588
You can't be here.

01:52.155 --> 01:56.027
I think she just
wanted to be with you.

01:57.943 --> 02:01.599
[walkers growling]

02:01.730 --> 02:04.254
-The flare.
-We gotta go.

02:04.385 --> 02:07.257
You can't be here.
You hear me?

02:07.388 --> 02:10.782
I can't protect you and
help Maggie. There was a plan.

02:10.913 --> 02:12.828
Her and I, we come here,
we get Hershel.

02:12.958 --> 02:15.265
You stay with her people,
where you're safe!

02:15.396 --> 02:16.440
That was the whole
goddamn point!

02:16.571 --> 02:19.182
That you stay safe.
And you know that, Ginny.

02:19.313 --> 02:23.230
-[Negan] Shit!
-I can take her back.

02:24.970 --> 02:27.190
You finish what you started.

02:27.321 --> 02:29.497
I can take her
where she needs to go.

02:32.978 --> 02:36.417
[haunting ambient music]

02:39.550 --> 02:43.511
Listen to me,
you're gonna go with him.

02:43.641 --> 02:47.906
And he'll keep you safe.
He is good people.

02:48.037 --> 02:50.648
Ginny, I can't go with you,
and you can't stay with me.

02:50.779 --> 02:55.087
Hell, you do not want
to stay with me.

02:55.218 --> 02:58.134
You don't know me, kid.

02:58.265 --> 03:01.442
I am not who you think I am.

03:08.013 --> 03:10.451
I... want you to--

03:10.581 --> 03:13.410
No!

03:13.541 --> 03:17.675
All these months
and now you want to chat?

03:27.598 --> 03:28.904
I killed your dad.

03:29.948 --> 03:33.778
[music intensifies]

03:39.219 --> 03:43.484
I'm not wanted
for robbing a wagon train.

03:43.614 --> 03:46.138
I killed five men.

03:46.269 --> 03:48.924
And your dad,
he was one of them.

03:49.054 --> 03:52.101
It's why I tracked you down
to the farm.

03:52.232 --> 03:57.933
Why I let you tag along,
'cause I knew you had no one.

03:58.063 --> 04:02.503
You? You're just a debt
that I had to pay.

04:04.766 --> 04:06.942
That's it.

04:18.082 --> 04:20.390
I got you. Come on.
Let's go. Come on.

04:41.237 --> 04:45.415

[theme music]

05:39.295 --> 05:43.473
[panting]

05:50.784 --> 05:52.700
Time to go.

05:59.271 --> 06:05.365
[wistful, haunting music]

06:15.766 --> 06:18.726
[birds chirping, cooing]

06:28.518 --> 06:32.348
You should sleep.
I can keep watch.

06:33.001 --> 06:35.699
It's all right, I'm good.

06:35.830 --> 06:39.747
Besides, he shows up, two sets
of eyes are better than one.

06:41.575 --> 06:44.969
[birds squawking]

06:45.100 --> 06:49.626
What you did back there,
that couldn't have been easy.

06:57.982 --> 06:59.549
You think the plan's
gonna work?

06:59.680 --> 07:03.597
I'll say this, he was
surprisingly glad to see my ass.

07:03.727 --> 07:06.556
Water under the bridge, he said.

07:06.687 --> 07:09.777
It's not like our reunion
went off without a hitch, but,

07:09.907 --> 07:13.084
with all our history,
that brotherly bullshit,

07:13.215 --> 07:17.132
I have a feelin' he and I may be
able to work something out.

07:36.064 --> 07:38.370
For me, it wasn't
the Statue of Liberty.

07:41.373 --> 07:43.680
It was Macy's.

07:49.904 --> 07:55.387
When I was little,
after my mom got sick,

07:55.518 --> 07:57.955
I'd crawl into bed with her
and she'd tell me stories.

08:00.654 --> 08:03.265
About Santa.

08:03.395 --> 08:05.528
The real Santa.

08:08.792 --> 08:12.883
Sometimes he'd come down
from the North Pole

08:13.014 --> 08:16.713
to the Macy's store in Manhattan
and visit all the kids.

08:19.107 --> 08:23.372
And I used to daydream
that one day I'd go to New York,

08:23.503 --> 08:26.854
walk into that Macy's,

08:26.984 --> 08:30.074
become best friends
with the real Santa.

08:31.380 --> 08:34.251
He'd take all my toys
that I'd lost

08:34.383 --> 08:37.212
or that had been broken,

08:37.342 --> 08:40.736
and he'd find a way
to replace them.

08:44.131 --> 08:49.964
[mellow, bright ambient music]

08:53.315 --> 08:55.665
And there it is.

08:59.277 --> 09:02.019
[tires squealing]

10:37.245 --> 10:39.551

Where there's smoke, huh?

10:44.687 --> 10:47.342
Guess you were right all along.

10:50.040 --> 10:50.693
Let's go.

10:52.390 --> 10:56.133
[music intensifies]

11:03.663 --> 11:05.969
Hey.

11:06.100 --> 11:07.928
You were inside the sewers
with Ginny.

11:08.058 --> 11:10.800
What do you think
she was trying to tell me?

11:12.759 --> 11:14.586
[Maggie] I don't know, maybe she
knew that you'd be mad at her

11:14.717 --> 11:18.939
for coming and just wanted
to explain herself.

11:23.247 --> 11:28.470

[grunts and coughs]

13:48.784 --> 13:50.307
[screams]

13:52.353 --> 13:54.746
Drop it.

14:08.630 --> 14:10.806
Here's what I'm thinking.

14:10.937 --> 14:13.635
The Croat never took your grain,
just your kid.

14:15.811 --> 14:17.117
For collateral, sure,

14:17.247 --> 14:20.337
but he was never coming back
for no harvest.

14:21.425 --> 14:24.037
He wanted me.

14:24.167 --> 14:27.605
And for what?
Who the hell knows.

14:27.736 --> 14:31.783
But whatever that crazy
son of a bitch wants with me,

14:31.914 --> 14:34.438
I sure as shit
ain't gonna like it.

14:34.961 --> 14:37.964
You and I both know that much.

14:38.834 --> 14:41.750
The shit thing is, Maggie,

14:41.881 --> 14:43.970
we could have done it.

14:44.100 --> 14:46.624
We could have saved Hershel.

14:48.104 --> 14:52.717
Because you and I together, we
made one hell of a badass team.

14:52.848 --> 14:56.025
But you know that, don't you?

14:56.547 --> 15:00.682
Maybe some part of you always
wanted it to end this way.

15:06.166 --> 15:10.953
The fact is, Maggie, it doesn't
matter what excuses I give you

15:11.084 --> 15:15.784
or how many apologies I offer,

15:16.785 --> 15:18.918
you can't get over it.

15:23.748 --> 15:26.012
And you shouldn't.

15:29.885 --> 15:32.714
[door opens]

15:35.717 --> 15:41.505
[sinister music]

16:02.787 --> 16:04.659
[brakes squealing]

16:10.621 --> 16:16.453
[haunting music]

16:37.909 --> 16:39.563
[Armstrong] Hey!

16:46.396 --> 16:48.007
[Nina] Welcome home.

17:02.847 --> 17:07.069
[The Croat] We first looked for
you at the Sanctuary.

17:07.200 --> 17:12.248
It was a husk
abandoned long ago,

17:12.378 --> 17:15.338
which was depressing.

17:15.469 --> 17:17.645
And after searching up and down
the mainland for God knows

17:17.775 --> 17:19.864
how many months,

17:19.994 --> 17:22.954
I learned of your status.

17:23.085 --> 17:26.741
Four men and a magistrate.

17:27.611 --> 17:29.831
You, you, you.

17:29.961 --> 17:32.442
And then I found Jerome.

17:32.573 --> 17:38.057
He was not much interested
in reminiscing, but

17:38.187 --> 17:41.582
he was alone and weak.

17:41.712 --> 17:46.761
And I convinced him to talk.
And he told me a story

17:46.891 --> 17:50.895
that excited my curiosity.

17:51.026 --> 17:54.160
The story of the widow.

17:54.290 --> 17:59.078
Either way, I saw that
you could help.

17:59.208 --> 18:03.082
Strong, smart.

18:03.212 --> 18:08.565
Vulnerabilities to be exploited.

18:08.696 --> 18:11.264
And most of all,

18:11.394 --> 18:15.964
you needed a little push,
yes, but...

18:16.095 --> 18:19.228
you had your own incentives.

18:19.359 --> 18:23.276
Still, I never expected you
to pull it off.

18:23.406 --> 18:27.758
But you did.
You found him.

18:27.889 --> 18:30.587
And brought him home.

18:33.329 --> 18:35.592
Doma smo, eh?

18:38.726 --> 18:42.033
You know, for a moment
when I saw you on the catwalk

18:42.164 --> 18:46.212
all alone, I thought to myself,
lucky me.

18:46.342 --> 18:50.912
I get to have Negan
and the child.

18:55.003 --> 18:57.484
Nah, it's okay.

19:02.097 --> 19:04.621
He's enough.

19:12.107 --> 19:13.935
[tires squealing]

19:14.065 --> 19:20.159
[dark, thunderous music]

[tense music]

19:44.052 --> 19:45.532
[door opens]

19:47.534 --> 19:51.277
Hey.

19:52.365 --> 19:54.236
Just look after Ginny, will you?

19:54.367 --> 19:56.891
That's all I ask.

19:57.021 --> 20:00.851
[music softens,
becomes somber]

20:00.982 --> 20:02.462
[door opens]

20:24.962 --> 20:26.529
How do we do this?

20:26.660 --> 20:30.316
Well, we both want
the same thing, no?

20:31.969 --> 20:38.019
[music continues]

21:12.227 --> 21:13.837
It's good to see you, kid.

21:15.926 --> 21:21.976

21:45.956 --> 21:52.006

22:23.298 --> 22:29.348

22:45.407 --> 22:47.888
[Armstrong] It was like a maze
full of sculptures

22:48.018 --> 22:51.848
made up of whatever
they could find, I guess.

22:51.979 --> 22:55.199
But, uh, I tracked him down,

22:55.330 --> 22:57.419
got him up against a wall,

22:57.550 --> 22:59.856
had a gun on him.

22:59.987 --> 23:03.294
He made a move to get away,
and...

23:03.425 --> 23:06.863
I shot him, killed him.

23:06.994 --> 23:08.648
[New Babylon Man #1] Got him!
Got the son of a bitch--

23:08.778 --> 23:11.390
Let him finish!

23:11.955 --> 23:13.130
I want to hear the rest.

23:13.261 --> 23:14.741
[Armstrong]
Not much more to tell.

23:14.871 --> 23:19.093
Got back to my boat.
Car was where I left it.

23:19.223 --> 23:22.226
Enough ethanol to get me home
in one straight shot.

23:22.357 --> 23:25.447
Shame you had to shoot him,
though.

23:26.970 --> 23:28.624
As a marshal, I'm licensed to
administer justice--

23:28.755 --> 23:31.714
No, I know all about that.

23:31.845 --> 23:35.022
Just saying it would have been
nice to put him on display.

23:35.152 --> 23:37.546
Make a statement.

23:44.248 --> 23:46.294
No thank you, ma'am.

23:46.425 --> 23:49.166
How are your girls, by the way?

23:49.297 --> 23:53.257
Marjorie, Bea and... Dessie?

23:53.388 --> 23:56.652
Don't worry, we looked out
for them while you were gone.

23:56.783 --> 23:59.133
I should pay them a visit.

23:59.263 --> 24:02.702
Let 'em know all about their
daddy's heroics.

24:02.832 --> 24:07.010
How hard he works to protect
our body politic.

24:10.057 --> 24:13.364
[unsettling music]

24:20.633 --> 24:23.592
I knew you couldn't
help yourself.

24:30.643 --> 24:33.167
You know what went into
making that cigar?

24:33.297 --> 24:36.083
You see, the thing is,
gotta cure the leaves

24:36.213 --> 24:39.739
at a temperature of 100 degrees.

24:39.869 --> 24:43.133
And a temperature like that,

24:43.264 --> 24:45.353
an exact temperature.

24:45.484 --> 24:48.487
What's the optimal way
to keep that going?

24:52.186 --> 24:54.580
Central heating.

24:54.710 --> 24:56.843
But ethanol comes from corn,

24:56.973 --> 25:01.630
which takes up
thousands of acres of fields.

25:04.067 --> 25:07.984
So what I'd like you to do,
Marshal,

25:08.115 --> 25:12.206
I'd like you to
tell me your story again.

25:12.336 --> 25:14.425
And this time,

25:14.556 --> 25:18.081
I want you to tell me
all about the methane.

25:21.345 --> 25:27.221
[music intensifies,
then softens and fades]

25:29.005 --> 25:31.573
[sighs]

25:33.880 --> 25:37.231
I can't begin to imagine
what you went through.

25:38.798 --> 25:41.452
-I hope that you know I--
-I was fine.

25:45.369 --> 25:46.457
That's because you're brave--

25:46.588 --> 25:47.720
All I ever do back home
is wait for

25:47.850 --> 25:49.852
the next bad thing to happen.

25:49.983 --> 25:53.247
If anything,
I felt safer back there.

25:53.377 --> 25:59.253
[rain pattering]
