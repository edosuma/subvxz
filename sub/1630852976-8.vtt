00:07.616 --> 00:10.140
Previously
onStar Picard...

00:11.924 --> 00:13.317
I think I'll steer
the ship for a while.

00:13.361 --> 00:14.666
No. Wait...

00:14.710 --> 00:17.104
-I'm in control.
-Not anymore.

00:17.147 --> 00:18.931
A Borg Queen loose
in Los Angeles.

00:18.975 --> 00:21.064
She's not the Borg
Queen-- don't say that.

00:21.108 --> 00:22.761
Nanoprobes multiply,
Queen gets stronger.

00:22.805 --> 00:25.721
Less and less Jurati.

00:25.764 --> 00:28.767
We're witnessing
the birth of a new queen.

00:28.811 --> 00:30.247
We're supposed
to save the future,

00:30.291 --> 00:31.640
but we might've just doomed it.

00:31.683 --> 00:34.599
-My life's work.
-You're scaring me.

00:34.643 --> 00:37.080
I let myself believe
you were the one.

00:37.124 --> 00:38.647
You'd make it.

00:38.690 --> 00:40.605
Why don't I remember this?

00:40.649 --> 00:42.172
Or any of these?

00:42.216 --> 00:45.045
SOONG
This one will be the last.

00:45.088 --> 00:46.742
I will do anything

00:46.785 --> 00:49.310
to make sure she survives.

00:49.353 --> 00:51.051
Kore.

00:51.094 --> 00:52.835
Dad, what did you do?

00:52.878 --> 00:55.359
He's saying it's about me,

00:55.403 --> 00:57.709
but it's deeply urgent to him.

00:57.753 --> 00:59.755
That's unexpected.

00:59.798 --> 01:01.931
You can't really want me
to summon a Q?

01:10.418 --> 01:13.073
It didn't work.

01:15.727 --> 01:17.207
We're closed.

01:17.251 --> 01:19.688
One drink and I'm out
of your hair, please?

01:19.731 --> 01:22.125
We could all use a dash of extra

01:22.169 --> 01:24.171
with all this ordinary.

01:24.214 --> 01:26.738
-- What is this?
-- Law enforcement.

01:26.782 --> 01:29.176
I'm gonna need you two
to come with me.

02:26.320 --> 02:27.930
Oh, finally!

02:27.973 --> 02:31.194
Uh, it's, uh, Wells, isn't it?

02:31.238 --> 02:33.109
I...

02:33.153 --> 02:35.329
Uh, don't worry.

02:35.372 --> 02:36.895
It's just an interview.

02:36.939 --> 02:40.072
I don't like the word
"interrogation."

02:40.116 --> 02:42.466
All right.

02:42.510 --> 02:45.513
Let's see.

02:46.253 --> 02:48.516
Question one.

02:49.691 --> 02:52.520
Are you
an extraterrestrial life-form?

02:58.569 --> 03:00.963
I can truly say...

03:01.006 --> 03:03.095
I am not.

03:06.011 --> 03:08.188
What are you writing?

03:08.231 --> 03:10.494
Well, you're laughing,
so I'm making note

03:10.538 --> 03:12.844
that your species has humor.

03:12.888 --> 03:14.803
This is absurd.

03:14.846 --> 03:16.718
Look, we have cooperated

03:16.761 --> 03:18.502
and now we'd like to leave.

03:18.546 --> 03:20.852
You can leave as soon as you
tell me about your plans

03:20.896 --> 03:23.812
to sabotage the Europa mission.

03:25.553 --> 03:28.643
And there it is.

03:28.686 --> 03:30.949
This guy is buckets of crazy.

03:30.993 --> 03:33.865
This is super "off the books."

03:33.909 --> 03:35.867
We're in a basement

03:35.911 --> 03:37.913
with a bunch
of broken filing cabinets.

03:37.956 --> 03:40.959
That camera's
not even plugged in.

03:41.743 --> 03:44.615
You're right.

03:44.659 --> 03:46.704
This is super "off the books."

03:46.748 --> 03:49.881
In fact, no one even knows
you're here.

03:49.925 --> 03:53.320
In this FBI field office
basement.

03:53.363 --> 03:57.237
And things do tend
to disappear down here.

03:57.280 --> 04:00.022
Hopes, dreams.

04:01.415 --> 04:04.200
As of today,

04:04.244 --> 04:06.115
aliens.

06:17.986 --> 06:20.380
We tracked Jurati to a dive bar.

06:21.729 --> 06:23.208
-Okay, I'm coming to you.
-No!

06:23.252 --> 06:24.949
No, you got to stay
on La Sirena.

06:24.993 --> 06:27.038
Are you out of your mind?!
There's a Borg Queen...

06:27.082 --> 06:29.171
loose in L.A.

06:29.214 --> 06:31.173
You think I don't know
how bad this could go?

06:31.216 --> 06:32.522
It's 2024.

06:32.566 --> 06:34.306
People have trouble
with revolving doors.

06:34.350 --> 06:36.047
They can't handle a Borg Queen.

06:36.091 --> 06:37.875
She's more than a Borg Queen.

06:37.919 --> 06:39.747
Agnes is in there.

06:39.790 --> 06:41.357
Maybe.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.185
You need to go through
every operating system

06:43.228 --> 06:45.187
and make sure she didn't
Borgify anything else.

06:45.230 --> 06:46.928
And figure out a way to contain

06:46.971 --> 06:48.930
her majesty once we find her.
Out.

06:48.973 --> 06:51.454
Abnormal life signs,
but they're too far away,

06:51.498 --> 06:54.065
-or diminished to pinpoint.
-So she's anywhere

06:54.109 --> 06:56.154
in a 15-block radius?

06:56.198 --> 06:57.939
That's not good enough.

06:57.982 --> 06:59.723
You're gonna have
to Borg up, lady.

06:59.767 --> 07:02.117
No cranial implant equals

07:02.160 --> 07:04.728
no Borg proximity transceiver--
I can't track her.

07:04.772 --> 07:06.948
I meant analog-- you are her.

07:06.991 --> 07:08.863
Loose with legs.

07:08.906 --> 07:10.691
What do you do?

07:10.734 --> 07:12.432
I don't know, Raffi.

07:12.475 --> 07:14.042
I'm not Borg.

07:14.085 --> 07:15.913
You are Seven, right?

07:15.957 --> 07:18.960
And who is that exactly to you?

07:19.003 --> 07:21.484
You know what? Never mind. Hey!

07:21.528 --> 07:23.312
Uh, could I ask
about your window?

07:23.355 --> 07:24.444
You a cop?

07:24.487 --> 07:26.446
You don't want to talk
to the police?

07:26.489 --> 07:28.099
I've seen how they deal
with nutcases.

07:28.143 --> 07:29.274
Not exactly delicate.

07:29.318 --> 07:31.146
That's why I want to find her

07:31.189 --> 07:33.278
before the police do.
She's not well.

07:33.322 --> 07:34.584
No shit.

07:34.628 --> 07:36.456
She's my sister.

07:36.499 --> 07:40.024
We're trying to get her into
a facility. If you could help...

07:40.808 --> 07:42.940
She left here with a guy.

07:42.984 --> 07:44.812
Big, red beard.

07:44.855 --> 07:46.074
Which way?

07:46.117 --> 07:47.467
She went that,
turned the corner.

07:47.510 --> 07:48.555
Thanks.

07:49.773 --> 07:52.297
-How's that for analog?
-I...

07:52.341 --> 07:55.170
Believe me, we would be thrilled

07:55.213 --> 07:58.521
to see the rocket
safely launch tomorrow.

07:58.565 --> 08:00.131
Uh-huh.

08:00.175 --> 08:02.917
I've got a lady friend
with the city,

08:02.960 --> 08:04.614
shoots me an email
anytime something odd

08:04.658 --> 08:06.442
pops up on the CCTV.

08:06.486 --> 08:10.141
Like when someone shimmers into
existence on a downtown street.

08:10.185 --> 08:13.405
Dropped your image
into our database.

08:13.449 --> 08:16.365
And, uh... boom!

08:17.584 --> 08:21.675
One of six known trespassers
at the Europa Gala.

08:21.718 --> 08:25.026
I put this all together--
I think, why would aliens

08:25.069 --> 08:28.464
crash a gala
for a space mission?

08:31.598 --> 08:34.731
You don't seem like the kind
of guy they send in

08:34.775 --> 08:37.255
to break terrorists.

08:37.299 --> 08:41.216
Not getting
"FBI's Top Interrogator" vibes.

08:42.565 --> 08:45.568
Something else put you
in that chair?

08:45.612 --> 08:48.440
Tell me, Agent Wells...

08:50.268 --> 08:53.271
...what makes you
the man for this job?

08:54.055 --> 08:56.144
Think of me as just
a good, old-fashioned,

08:56.187 --> 08:58.015
dedicated civil servant.

08:58.059 --> 08:59.930
Work a lot.

08:59.974 --> 09:01.671
Don't sleep.

09:01.715 --> 09:05.588
Comes in all wrinkled
with your huge mug of coffee.

09:05.632 --> 09:08.025
I'm a bartender.

09:08.069 --> 09:10.114
I've seen your kind before.

09:10.158 --> 09:12.421
This is personal.

09:15.163 --> 09:17.426
That's, uh... quite a bruise

09:17.469 --> 09:20.124
on your hand, sir.
Looks like it's from an IV.

09:20.168 --> 09:22.866
I was dehydrated.

09:22.910 --> 09:26.130
After all, I'm only human.

09:26.914 --> 09:28.611
You certainly are.

09:28.655 --> 09:30.178
Thank you, folks.

09:30.221 --> 09:32.223
That'll be all for now.

09:40.101 --> 09:41.885
If he believes
that we are tampering

09:41.929 --> 09:43.278
with the Europa Mission,

09:43.321 --> 09:45.672
then Q has no need to stop Renée

09:45.715 --> 09:48.588
from boarding the ship at all.
The authorities

09:48.631 --> 09:50.590
will just simply scrub

09:50.633 --> 09:53.070
the whole launch.

09:53.114 --> 09:55.899
And we will have
broken the future

09:55.943 --> 09:58.772
on our own.

09:59.599 --> 10:03.298
Frustration got
the better of me.

10:04.691 --> 10:07.041
I know now...

10:07.084 --> 10:10.479
this one will be the last.

10:16.006 --> 10:18.269
I need to get in there.

10:27.148 --> 10:29.629
Aspectus, extrapolate 2D video

10:29.672 --> 10:31.674
to 3D environment.

10:36.157 --> 10:38.550
What are you hiding, Dad?

10:40.117 --> 10:42.293
Patience, mon petit.

10:42.337 --> 10:43.904
Who the hell are you?

10:43.947 --> 10:46.602
A friend. A fire-starter.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.560
A simulacra--

10:48.604 --> 10:50.432
a living program--
planted here

10:50.475 --> 10:52.477
when I hacked
into your father's system.

10:52.521 --> 10:56.612
Waiting for you to arrive
at this very moment.

11:00.398 --> 11:03.532
So close to the answers
you seek.

11:08.145 --> 11:11.018
I'm sorry
the others didn't make it.

11:12.541 --> 11:15.762
Looks like you were
the strongest of the bunch.

11:24.422 --> 11:27.251
That's a human genome.

11:27.295 --> 11:29.689
What was he...?

11:32.169 --> 11:34.215
Am I...?

11:34.258 --> 11:35.999
Am I an experiment?

11:36.043 --> 11:37.435
He created you.

11:37.479 --> 11:40.090
But locked you in a prison.

11:40.134 --> 11:42.353
I'm sending you the key.

11:42.397 --> 11:44.529
Are you brave enough to use it?

11:58.935 --> 12:02.460
Delivery available
in environ-safe airlock.

12:28.704 --> 12:31.141
People are so easy
when they trust you.

12:31.185 --> 12:32.969
I knew exactly
what to say to that guy.

12:33.013 --> 12:34.579
It's like his face was a map.

12:34.623 --> 12:36.756
-No wonder I'm president.

12:37.931 --> 12:40.368
Shit.

12:42.718 --> 12:45.068
Doesn't mean Jurati's
not in there somewhere,

12:45.112 --> 12:47.767
-trying to fight.
-Well, if she is,

12:47.810 --> 12:50.421
she's losing.

12:52.119 --> 12:54.208
I'd want nothing.

12:54.251 --> 12:55.992
In her shoes.

12:56.036 --> 12:58.342
I'd want nothing except...

12:58.386 --> 13:00.823
that connection.

13:00.867 --> 13:04.087
If you felt it,
it's hard to think of anything

13:04.131 --> 13:06.742
except... getting it back.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.440
It's good. Good, just...
all right, all right.

13:09.484 --> 13:11.921
Just-just keep going.

13:12.704 --> 13:15.620
She hasn't been able
to assimilate or we'd know.

13:16.665 --> 13:18.972
She can't have what she wants,
so she...

13:19.015 --> 13:21.975
tried to recreate
that feeling of connection.

13:22.018 --> 13:23.890
One-on-one.

13:23.933 --> 13:25.587
Mm, why kill him?

13:25.630 --> 13:28.329
Because it didn't work.

13:28.372 --> 13:31.941
She didn't feel anything
one-on-one.

13:31.985 --> 13:34.291
It wasn't enough.

13:34.335 --> 13:36.511
She grew frustrated, angry.

13:36.554 --> 13:40.080
Took it out on...
what couldn't satisfy her.

13:40.123 --> 13:42.256
Wow.

13:42.299 --> 13:44.345
I mean,
that's incredibly spot on.

13:44.388 --> 13:46.651
Can you not?

13:46.695 --> 13:48.915
That I can "access her,"
it's not impressive.

13:48.958 --> 13:51.221
-You could just be a little less

13:51.265 --> 13:53.484
happy that I'm defective.

13:53.528 --> 13:56.139
Okay, I-I'm gonna try not
to take you personally now--

13:56.183 --> 13:57.793
You manipulate.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.535
Everyone has to be exactly
where Raffi wants them.

14:00.578 --> 14:03.538
You think we don't see it,
but we all do.

14:05.409 --> 14:07.281
This is probably his phone.

14:07.324 --> 14:09.283
What's in cell phone batteries?

14:11.111 --> 14:13.287
Um, uh, here.

14:13.330 --> 14:15.202
Um...

14:15.245 --> 14:17.204
Lithium ions.

14:17.247 --> 14:19.249
They're a-a stabilizing metal.

14:19.293 --> 14:22.078
High energy storage--
whoa, whoa, hey.

14:22.122 --> 14:23.732
You all right?

14:25.429 --> 14:27.779
When you're assimilated,
the Borg inject you

14:27.823 --> 14:31.827
with stabilizing metals, so your
body can handle nanoprobes.

14:33.742 --> 14:35.700
I can still remember the smell.

14:35.744 --> 14:36.876
I was six.

14:39.052 --> 14:41.837
I can taste it now.

14:42.620 --> 14:45.188
If we can't contain her...

14:45.232 --> 14:47.712
are we gonna have
to kill Jurati?

15:15.262 --> 15:16.916
Jurati!

15:16.959 --> 15:18.395
That's it, stop!

15:43.638 --> 15:45.988
No...

15:46.032 --> 15:48.730
No!

16:19.021 --> 16:22.372
The thing is,
obsession's only obsession

16:22.416 --> 16:23.983
until it pays off.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.027
Then it's diligence.

16:25.071 --> 16:27.464
Sorry... what?

16:27.508 --> 16:29.466
IV bruise.

16:29.510 --> 16:31.251
Clearly you wouldn't
have gone to a hospital.

16:31.294 --> 16:32.948
So I got to thinking clinic,

16:32.992 --> 16:34.950
clinic-- where have I
heard that recently?

16:34.994 --> 16:37.735
You know who else went
to a clinic?

16:38.388 --> 16:40.086
Your buddy.

16:40.129 --> 16:43.132
He was arrested during
a Homeland Security raid there.

16:43.176 --> 16:45.134
He also made this, uh...

16:45.178 --> 16:47.832
completely innocuous statement.

16:47.876 --> 16:50.705
Would you mind reading it
out loud?

16:51.880 --> 16:55.144
"I'm stuck back
in a particularly

16:55.188 --> 16:59.061
"primitive past,
trying to correct the timeline

16:59.105 --> 17:04.023
"with a ragtag group of misfits,
including one cybernetic queen

17:04.066 --> 17:07.678
"that I'm fairly certain is
just in it to wipe out

17:07.722 --> 17:11.856
"all of humanity
with her old cohort...

17:14.076 --> 17:17.340
"...a crusty old admiral who,
if I understand it correctly,

17:17.384 --> 17:20.996
is now a flesh-and-blood robot."

17:21.040 --> 17:23.085
Well, clearly
he has been subjected

17:23.129 --> 17:25.696
to barbaric
interrogation techniques.

17:25.740 --> 17:28.047
So, couple of things.

17:28.090 --> 17:29.918
Wiping out humanity?

17:29.961 --> 17:32.094
Be good to circle back to that.

17:32.138 --> 17:35.532
And... I just had

17:35.576 --> 17:37.839
said clinic searched.

17:39.884 --> 17:41.103
How long you think it's gonna be

17:41.147 --> 17:43.714
before my guys figure out
this technology's

17:43.758 --> 17:46.413
not from Earth, hmm?

17:49.155 --> 17:50.895
Ma'am.

17:50.939 --> 17:52.462
If you wouldn't mind
accompanying

17:52.506 --> 17:54.334
my colleague down the hall?

17:54.377 --> 17:56.118
I'm gonna focus on your uncle.

18:03.430 --> 18:05.823
This is Spaceman Sonic
to Planet Mars.

18:05.867 --> 18:07.782
You can run, but you can't hide.

18:07.825 --> 18:10.393
Pew, pew, pew, pew!

18:10.437 --> 18:12.395
Launch missiles!

18:12.439 --> 18:14.571
Hey, no.

18:14.615 --> 18:17.313
Are you sure this is okay?

18:17.357 --> 18:19.141
Oh, he can't hurt anything.

18:19.185 --> 18:21.404
Ship's in diagnostic mode
for another hour

18:21.448 --> 18:23.145
rooting around for any stowaway

18:23.189 --> 18:25.626
Borg subroutines.

18:30.457 --> 18:32.285
You guys hungry?

18:32.328 --> 18:34.374
Anything you want.

18:34.417 --> 18:36.506
Anything?

18:37.290 --> 18:39.248
-Four cakes!
-Ricardo!

18:48.127 --> 18:50.694
Oh.

18:55.656 --> 18:57.788
-Mmm.
-What's your life like...

18:57.832 --> 19:00.313
-together?
-Chaos.

19:01.314 --> 19:03.620
The effect of which
will surely...

19:03.664 --> 19:07.015
screw him up
in a potpourri of ways.

19:07.058 --> 19:09.670
I work so much.

19:10.671 --> 19:14.196
when I get home, I just let him
stay up in my bed watching TV.

19:15.197 --> 19:17.634
He's a nut.

19:17.678 --> 19:19.941
He loves cooking shows.

19:21.421 --> 19:24.119
I had a different upbringing.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.426
Boundaried.

19:26.469 --> 19:28.906
Reserved.

19:29.690 --> 19:31.953
I'm not perfect,
but I'm not that.

19:32.910 --> 19:35.174
He's a nine-year-old
who's obsessed with plants.

19:35.217 --> 19:37.219
You're...

19:39.221 --> 19:40.657
How about you?

19:40.701 --> 19:42.703
I'll never see you again.

19:42.746 --> 19:44.661
I would like to have more
in my memory bank

19:44.705 --> 19:47.229
than all the times
I saved your ass.

19:47.273 --> 19:50.014
I'd like to think
we saved each other.

20:34.102 --> 20:37.410
At this bar,
you tell me something.

20:37.453 --> 20:39.803
About yourself.

20:40.935 --> 20:43.285
I've known you
for ten years, and it just...

20:44.678 --> 20:46.723
...it brings me to tears.

20:46.767 --> 20:49.030
I never knew that.

20:50.031 --> 20:52.947
That's what I want you
to tell me now.

20:52.990 --> 20:55.863
Before you fly away.

20:57.125 --> 21:00.563
A fundamental, deepest truth

21:00.607 --> 21:02.696
that, in another life,

21:02.739 --> 21:05.133
it took me
a decade to learn about you.

21:11.618 --> 21:14.577
That, um...

21:14.621 --> 21:17.450
the moment I fell for you...

21:17.493 --> 21:19.626
I...

21:19.669 --> 21:21.149
Mom?

21:22.803 --> 21:25.153
My tummy hurts.

21:25.196 --> 21:27.808
Your fault.

21:43.998 --> 21:45.608
Details!

21:45.652 --> 21:48.698
What are your intentions
regarding the Europa mission?

21:48.742 --> 21:51.179
None, I assure you.

21:57.664 --> 21:59.883
I'm not naive.

22:03.017 --> 22:04.845
I know I'm out-brained.

22:04.888 --> 22:07.282
You found Earth,
speak the language.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.632
Clearly you're eons
more advanced.

22:09.676 --> 22:11.808
But listen to me.

22:11.852 --> 22:14.420
Everyone has pain receptors.

22:14.463 --> 22:16.509
Your alien tech?

22:16.552 --> 22:18.380
Paperwork's been filed.

22:18.424 --> 22:20.469
Other people know now.

22:20.513 --> 22:23.429
So talking to me is
as good as it gets.

22:23.472 --> 22:25.648
The boys up the line arrive,

22:25.692 --> 22:27.563
they get their answers
another way.

22:27.607 --> 22:29.435
Then they cut you into pieces,

22:29.478 --> 22:30.958
shove you under a microscope,

22:31.001 --> 22:32.960
and the gist of your existence

22:33.003 --> 22:35.832
will be redacted report
and rumor.

22:35.876 --> 22:37.921
They are coming.

22:37.965 --> 22:41.011
And to them,

22:41.055 --> 22:43.884
you're nothing
but a pig in a jar.

22:46.713 --> 22:48.932
This way, sir.

22:54.198 --> 22:55.504
You?

22:55.548 --> 22:57.201
You summoned me?

22:57.245 --> 22:58.942
You must be Q.

22:58.986 --> 23:01.292
Took your damn time.

23:01.336 --> 23:03.947
And you are that multi-celled,
sanctimonious,

23:03.991 --> 23:06.254
droning shrew known as Guinan.

23:06.297 --> 23:08.909
Right, it's the 21st century.

23:08.952 --> 23:11.215
Our paths have yet to cross.

23:11.259 --> 23:13.696
I thought
the summoning didn't work.

23:13.740 --> 23:15.568
"Summoning"?

23:15.611 --> 23:18.222
The summoning is
a sacred ritual.

23:18.266 --> 23:20.834
Not a chat by which you bipeds

23:20.877 --> 23:22.923
exchange the nauseating minutiae

23:22.966 --> 23:25.099
of your pathetic lives.

23:25.142 --> 23:28.624
When the ritual stalled,
I felt something.

23:28.668 --> 23:31.148
Emptiness and fear.

23:32.541 --> 23:34.456
I thought it was me.

23:34.500 --> 23:35.979
But it wasn't.

23:36.023 --> 23:38.329
I feel it on you.

23:41.768 --> 23:44.074
You're dying.

23:45.162 --> 23:47.643
Another quality
I sincerely loathe

23:47.687 --> 23:49.645
about your species.

23:49.689 --> 23:51.734
Empathy.

23:51.778 --> 23:53.954
I knew you could
kill each other.

23:53.997 --> 23:56.609
-But otherwise, aren't you...
-Immortal?

23:56.652 --> 23:58.698
So I believed.

23:58.741 --> 24:00.743
Yet now...

24:00.787 --> 24:02.353
for the first time as I look

24:02.397 --> 24:04.399
across the temporal horizon,

24:04.443 --> 24:06.140
it darkens.

24:06.183 --> 24:08.272
You think I'm dying.

24:08.316 --> 24:10.797
I prefer to believe
that I am on the threshold

24:10.840 --> 24:13.103
of the unknowable.

24:13.147 --> 24:14.453
When I first I felt it,

24:14.496 --> 24:16.803
I thought to myself,
"This is good.

24:16.846 --> 24:19.240
This is new."

24:19.283 --> 24:21.547
Infinite life, after all,
has its drawbacks.

24:21.590 --> 24:23.940
And so I prepared myself

24:23.984 --> 24:26.290
to be enveloped in the warm

24:26.334 --> 24:29.206
glow of meaning.

24:30.381 --> 24:32.688
Well, that moment

24:32.732 --> 24:34.081
has yet to come.

24:34.124 --> 24:36.605
Not even a glimmer.

24:36.649 --> 24:38.825
Dying stars burn brighter

24:38.868 --> 24:41.654
as they spin towards extinction.

24:42.568 --> 24:45.048
I, on the other hand,
seem to be simply

24:45.092 --> 24:47.790
disappearing...

24:47.834 --> 24:50.314
into nothing.

24:50.358 --> 24:53.840
Why do you think it took me
so long to get here?

24:53.883 --> 24:57.147
That's why
you walked in here today?

24:57.191 --> 25:00.847
Why you're using humans
as your game pieces?

25:01.674 --> 25:03.632
You see that?

25:03.676 --> 25:06.809
I'm honestly trying
to vaporize you at this moment.

25:06.853 --> 25:09.508
This thing you're doing
to Picard,

25:09.551 --> 25:11.553
it's how you're hoping

25:11.597 --> 25:14.164
to find... meaning in your life?

25:14.208 --> 25:17.211
I now have a lifetime.

25:18.560 --> 25:21.128
Can a single act
redeem a lifetime?

25:21.171 --> 25:22.564
Why bring him to the past?

25:22.608 --> 25:24.610
I did not bring him
into the past.

25:24.653 --> 25:26.046
He did that on his own.

25:26.089 --> 25:27.830
There are many forms
of time travel.

25:27.874 --> 25:29.615
But he's trapped here.

25:29.658 --> 25:32.313
The trap... is immaterial.

25:32.356 --> 25:35.011
It's the escape that counts.

25:37.492 --> 25:39.668
I'll see you when I see you...
unfortunately.

25:43.063 --> 25:44.586
Humans.

25:44.630 --> 25:46.980
They're all trapped in the past.

26:14.616 --> 26:16.618
Hey.

26:19.752 --> 26:21.362
Last night, uh...

26:21.405 --> 26:24.583
Was all your talk
of fixing me a lie?

26:26.759 --> 26:28.891
Because no matter what...

26:29.762 --> 26:32.939
...I was never going to leave
this house, was I?

26:34.070 --> 26:36.029
Like Persephone?

26:36.072 --> 26:38.379
Persephassa?

26:38.422 --> 26:40.599
Despoina?

26:40.642 --> 26:42.905
Prosperina?

26:45.168 --> 26:47.475
Like Kore.

26:47.518 --> 26:50.521
Different names
for the same girl.

26:50.565 --> 26:53.263
Daughter of Zeus.

26:53.307 --> 26:55.570
Father of the gods.

26:56.789 --> 26:59.008
My creator.

27:01.315 --> 27:04.013
Explain your experiment...

27:04.057 --> 27:06.494
Dr. Soong.

27:06.537 --> 27:08.583
Technically...

27:09.802 --> 27:11.934
...you were

27:11.978 --> 27:14.067
created through somatic

27:14.110 --> 27:16.983
nuclear cell transfer
and gestated

27:17.026 --> 27:19.638
in a proprietary medium.

27:22.989 --> 27:25.600
How many before me?

27:27.167 --> 27:29.256
Lives of the first dozen were...

27:29.299 --> 27:31.562
measured in hours.

27:33.347 --> 27:36.350
The next few in days.

27:37.873 --> 27:40.180
Your predecessor

27:40.223 --> 27:42.617
almost made it
to her fourth birthday.

27:44.967 --> 27:47.056
And then came you.

27:47.100 --> 27:49.319
I did everything,

27:49.363 --> 27:51.670
sacrificed everything for you.

27:51.713 --> 27:54.803
You should've died
before you were six.

27:54.847 --> 27:56.587
But when you didn't,

27:56.631 --> 27:59.808
when you continued to live
despite defects--

27:59.852 --> 28:01.854
to thrive--

28:01.897 --> 28:03.986
I couldn't help but hope.

28:04.030 --> 28:05.771
And with hope

28:05.814 --> 28:07.947
came success!

28:07.990 --> 28:10.210
I mean, look at you.

28:11.080 --> 28:12.952
"Success"?

28:12.995 --> 28:14.997
-Not love?
-Well...

28:15.041 --> 28:16.738
of course I love you.

28:16.782 --> 28:18.174
Stop! You don't.

28:18.218 --> 28:19.785
You love your work!

28:21.221 --> 28:23.832
You told me stories of a mother.

28:23.876 --> 28:25.181
It made you happy.

28:25.225 --> 28:27.531
It wasn't real!

28:27.575 --> 28:29.533
"Real"?

28:29.577 --> 28:31.666
Real?

28:31.710 --> 28:35.539
Reality is a construct
of simple-minded fools,

28:35.583 --> 28:39.543
who can't function
in the absence of boundaries.

28:39.587 --> 28:41.545
Real.

28:43.112 --> 28:45.201
Anyone can procreate.

28:46.028 --> 28:47.726
You exist because

28:47.769 --> 28:50.380
I willed it.

28:55.908 --> 28:57.866
Of course I...

28:57.910 --> 29:00.042
of course I love my work.

29:00.086 --> 29:02.610
That doesn't mean
I don't love you.

29:06.396 --> 29:09.051
I want you to look inside, Dad.

29:09.095 --> 29:11.314
If I walk out
that door right now,

29:11.358 --> 29:13.664
what are you afraid of losing?

29:13.708 --> 29:15.710
Me?

29:15.754 --> 29:18.147
Or your legacy?

29:46.828 --> 29:48.830
Kore, stop! You'll--

29:50.310 --> 29:51.833
The grass feels nice.

29:54.749 --> 29:56.707
Freedom.

29:56.751 --> 29:58.622
From you.

29:59.710 --> 30:02.235
You don't get
to walk away from me.

30:03.976 --> 30:06.282
You don't exist without me.

30:06.326 --> 30:08.676
No, you follow me,
I call the cops.

30:13.072 --> 30:15.117
You know, maybe it's you

30:15.161 --> 30:17.598
who doesn't exist without me.

30:28.739 --> 30:30.829
-Raffi, let me see your neck.
-Oh, no.

30:30.872 --> 30:33.005
I'm good.
I'm all right, come on.

30:33.048 --> 30:34.528
She's...

30:34.571 --> 30:36.312
She went over there and...

30:36.356 --> 30:39.315
Ooh. No.
I'm-I'm almost all right.

30:39.359 --> 30:42.710
Just...

30:43.537 --> 30:46.061
She could've killed me easily.

30:46.105 --> 30:48.368
I know.

30:51.197 --> 30:54.591
Mercy is not a Borg quality.

30:56.028 --> 30:58.030
No.

30:58.073 --> 30:59.683
It's a Jurati quality.

30:59.727 --> 31:02.121
She's still in there somewhere.

31:02.164 --> 31:03.774
And she saved your life.

31:03.818 --> 31:05.254
So what next?

31:05.298 --> 31:06.603
She kickstarted her endorphins,

31:06.647 --> 31:08.301
ate a bunch of batteries.

31:08.344 --> 31:09.693
She'll use the metals
in her body

31:09.737 --> 31:11.652
to create primitive nanoprobes.

31:11.695 --> 31:13.697
-That gives her the ability
to assimilate.
-Then what?

31:13.741 --> 31:15.177
I don't know.

31:15.221 --> 31:17.005
With imperfect metals comes
imperfect assimilation.

31:17.049 --> 31:20.182
This is a means to an end,
some short-term plan.

31:20.226 --> 31:23.011
-Well, plans require
resources, so...
-Right, so...

31:23.055 --> 31:25.666
Whatever she needs, how does
she find it? She has no tech,

31:25.709 --> 31:27.276
or it would've shown up
on our scanners.

31:27.320 --> 31:29.496
Unless it's not our tech.

31:29.539 --> 31:30.932
Maybe she used
that guy's cell phone.

31:30.976 --> 31:33.892
Can we jump the battery
with our tricorder?

31:41.073 --> 31:44.206
You know, when you said
I manipulate people...

31:44.250 --> 31:46.469
-I'm sorry, I was--
-...I do!

31:47.993 --> 31:50.256
I do.

31:53.650 --> 31:54.913
It's contradictory
that you're in need of Seven

31:54.956 --> 31:56.784
staying on Earth
and fixing her ship

31:56.827 --> 31:58.351
so she can leave.

31:58.394 --> 32:00.657
Uh, I wouldn't say "in need."

32:00.701 --> 32:03.617
My sense is you're doing this
to appear less wanting,

32:03.660 --> 32:05.924
but it is, in fact,
quite transparent.

32:05.967 --> 32:07.969
Okay, just, you know,
shh, mm-mm.

32:08.013 --> 32:10.015
See this? This is supposed
to be a lesson

32:10.058 --> 32:11.973
on deflector shield maintenance.

32:12.017 --> 32:15.237
So you don't fail
basic tactical engineering.

32:15.281 --> 32:17.239
You know you're gonna have
to take

32:17.283 --> 32:19.546
that class if you went
into the security program.

32:19.589 --> 32:21.591
I wouldn't make
a good security officer.

32:21.635 --> 32:23.245
I've never been covert.

32:23.289 --> 32:25.552
I prefer a more straightforward

32:25.595 --> 32:27.641
vocation--
there's honor in truth.

32:27.684 --> 32:29.773
Oh, yes, that's right.

32:29.817 --> 32:31.471
"Choose to live."

32:33.125 --> 32:34.953
You and honor.

32:37.042 --> 32:38.826
Get a new thing.

32:38.869 --> 32:40.959
You and undercutting
anything real

32:41.002 --> 32:43.309
with nihilistic
and self-protecting humor,

32:43.352 --> 32:45.006
-get a new thing.
-Oh, oh, okay.

32:45.050 --> 32:47.139
You're getting good
with those comebacks.

32:47.182 --> 32:48.836
Don't' worry.

32:48.879 --> 32:51.056
I'll take care
of all your classes.

32:51.099 --> 32:53.232
Zani contacted me.

32:53.275 --> 32:55.930
They need me on Vashti.

32:55.974 --> 32:58.672
I could delay Starfleet
for a year.

32:58.715 --> 33:01.066
It'll bring me much honor
to repay a duty

33:01.109 --> 33:03.329
to the Qowat Milat.

33:05.026 --> 33:07.420
That's...

33:11.206 --> 33:13.469
Wow.

33:14.731 --> 33:17.125
I thought you wanted
to follow in my footsteps.

33:17.169 --> 33:19.432
We had a plan.

33:20.520 --> 33:22.043
Vashti is...

33:22.087 --> 33:24.872
I mean, it's-it's not
really you anymore, is it?

33:25.786 --> 33:28.006
It's so not the young man I see

33:28.049 --> 33:30.660
in front of me,
but-but you know what?

33:30.704 --> 33:33.489
If that's what you want to do,
I don't know,

33:33.533 --> 33:35.665
I mean, I'm sure it'll be

33:35.709 --> 33:38.190
fine, right, you know?

33:38.233 --> 33:40.366
I don't know.

33:40.409 --> 33:43.108
Hey... it's your life.

33:47.721 --> 33:50.550
I'm the reason Elnor stayed
at the Academy.

33:53.118 --> 33:55.729
I couldn't lose him, too.

33:58.123 --> 34:00.168
He stayed...

34:00.212 --> 34:02.475
for me.

34:02.518 --> 34:04.912
And then he died in my arms.

34:08.437 --> 34:12.441
Raff...

34:18.447 --> 34:20.058
Search history.

34:22.495 --> 34:24.453
What could she be looking for
there?

34:26.499 --> 34:28.892
Whatever she needs.

34:40.904 --> 34:43.429
I assume a lecture
on the futility of resistance

34:43.472 --> 34:46.084
is not going to be necessary?

34:47.433 --> 34:49.565
Am I dreaming?

34:49.609 --> 34:52.090
Or is this a nightmare?

34:53.134 --> 34:55.136
Ultimately...

34:55.180 --> 34:57.443
that's up to you.

35:00.446 --> 35:02.709
Why were you at the gala?

35:04.450 --> 35:06.408
Look, the launch is in 19 hours.

35:06.452 --> 35:07.975
If you don't give me
something now,

35:08.018 --> 35:09.585
I'll call
Mission Control myself.

35:14.547 --> 35:18.072
Picard...

35:19.465 --> 35:21.554
All humans

35:21.597 --> 35:24.122
are stuck in the past.

35:24.165 --> 35:26.689
Stuck.

35:27.821 --> 35:30.998
All humans are stuck
in the past.

35:31.041 --> 35:33.087
Stuck... in...

35:33.131 --> 35:35.176
the past.

35:37.787 --> 35:40.486
What the hell's happening here?

35:42.618 --> 35:44.229
Stuck.

35:44.272 --> 35:46.144
In the past.

35:46.187 --> 35:49.147
I know a haunted man

35:49.190 --> 35:51.453
when I see one.

35:51.497 --> 35:53.673
The things we hold onto.

35:53.716 --> 35:56.328
The pieces of...

35:56.371 --> 35:58.678
emotional shrapnel

35:58.721 --> 36:01.681
that drive us all our lives.

36:03.465 --> 36:06.642
What is it for you?

36:07.426 --> 36:10.124
What is your moment?

36:13.040 --> 36:16.565
What am I to you?

36:18.263 --> 36:19.655
Perhaps...

36:19.699 --> 36:22.310
an exchange...

36:22.354 --> 36:24.791
of truth.

36:27.054 --> 36:28.969
You?

36:29.012 --> 36:31.580
You're the thing
I've waited my whole life

36:31.624 --> 36:34.322
to come face to face with.

36:34.366 --> 36:36.629
The thing in the night.

36:38.065 --> 36:41.068
You're the monster in the dark.

36:48.206 --> 36:50.251
Maggie.

36:55.038 --> 36:57.258
Maggie.

36:57.302 --> 36:59.608
Here, pup.

37:03.743 --> 37:05.962
-Ma--

37:43.435 --> 37:45.306
Uh...

38:12.812 --> 38:15.075
He grabbed me.

38:15.118 --> 38:18.034
His whole hand was gonna...

38:18.078 --> 38:19.993
pull my eyeballs out.

38:20.036 --> 38:22.169
His-his fingers were

38:22.212 --> 38:23.953
going into--

38:23.997 --> 38:25.694
through my skin and then...

38:25.738 --> 38:27.696
I don't know.

38:27.740 --> 38:30.003
They-they vanished.

38:36.531 --> 38:38.359
Just like you.

38:39.578 --> 38:41.580
And at-- at that moment,
I knew

38:41.623 --> 38:44.278
I-I wouldn't walk the earth
like other people.

38:44.322 --> 38:47.237
Because if they were there
then...

38:48.630 --> 38:50.458
...they'd be back.

38:50.502 --> 38:52.504
And here you are.

38:52.547 --> 38:54.375
Show me

38:54.419 --> 38:57.509
what he did with his hand.

38:57.552 --> 38:59.685
His-his hands, he--

38:59.728 --> 39:01.382
he wouldn't let go, like he was

39:01.426 --> 39:03.863
pushing into my head.

39:04.864 --> 39:07.736
Are you certain that it wasn't

39:07.780 --> 39:10.696
like this?

39:19.879 --> 39:22.751
He wasn't a monster.

39:22.795 --> 39:26.189
He was... a Vulcan.

39:26.233 --> 39:27.843
And...

39:27.887 --> 39:30.672
he wasn't trying to kill you.

39:30.716 --> 39:33.371
He was trying to...

39:34.415 --> 39:35.982
...mind-meld.

39:36.025 --> 39:39.768
Trying to erase the memory

39:39.812 --> 39:43.381
so you wouldn't be haunted
like this.

39:43.424 --> 39:45.861
Clearly, it failed.

39:46.732 --> 39:48.690
And now

39:48.734 --> 39:51.214
for my truth.

39:51.258 --> 39:53.434
I am human.

39:53.478 --> 39:55.958
But I am from the future.

39:56.002 --> 39:59.397
The 25th century,

39:59.440 --> 40:01.573
to be precise.

40:01.616 --> 40:03.705
And I am here

40:03.749 --> 40:05.620
to save Earth.

40:05.664 --> 40:09.102
To save the entire galaxy,

40:09.145 --> 40:11.191
in fact.

40:12.932 --> 40:15.413
But to do so,

40:15.456 --> 40:17.327
it seems

40:17.371 --> 40:19.460
I need your help.

40:32.212 --> 40:35.128
Transporter subroutine booting.

40:36.695 --> 40:38.348
What's wrong?

40:38.392 --> 40:40.916
Error-- transporter off-line.

40:40.960 --> 40:43.266
Did I break it?

40:43.310 --> 40:44.703
No, no, no.

40:44.746 --> 40:46.879
Someone else.

40:46.922 --> 40:49.142
Hey, let's go find your mom.

40:53.886 --> 40:55.888
Rios to Raffi.

40:55.931 --> 40:58.499
We got big problems.

40:58.543 --> 41:01.415
Still no Picard?

41:01.459 --> 41:03.504
Q was talking about you.

41:03.548 --> 41:05.463
But he was talking
about all of you.

41:05.506 --> 41:08.291
-It's what special about humans.
-Yeah.

41:08.335 --> 41:11.469
Our inability
to escape the past.

41:11.512 --> 41:13.296
The opposite.

41:13.340 --> 41:15.473
When something
inside you is broken,

41:15.516 --> 41:17.126
it stays with you.

41:17.170 --> 41:20.521
You live in the past until
you're able to reconcile it,

41:20.565 --> 41:22.001
even if it's painful.

41:22.044 --> 41:24.090
You do the work...

41:24.133 --> 41:27.397
because you want to evolve.

41:32.664 --> 41:34.622
I almost forgot how unique

41:34.666 --> 41:36.972
that is in the galaxy.

41:39.366 --> 41:41.107
Any idea

41:41.150 --> 41:43.936
what Q meant when he said

41:43.979 --> 41:47.505
it was about the escape
not the trap?

41:47.548 --> 41:49.071
Like I said,

41:49.115 --> 41:51.334
he seemed crazy.

41:51.378 --> 41:52.466
And dying.

41:53.946 --> 41:55.338
How long till the launch?

41:55.382 --> 41:57.645
I'm sensitive
to the space-time continuum.

41:57.689 --> 41:59.473
I'm not a clock.

42:01.214 --> 42:04.173
Whole life built
around this job.

42:04.217 --> 42:07.568
Still... knew I'd get
the axe one day.

42:07.612 --> 42:10.136
You've been fired?

42:10.179 --> 42:12.399
-Why?
-The man who cried alien.

42:12.442 --> 42:14.575
And was wrong

42:14.619 --> 42:16.098
once again.

42:16.142 --> 42:17.883
But paperwork was filed.

42:17.926 --> 42:19.406
Oh, I lied.

42:19.449 --> 42:22.235
I knew if I gave them proof, uh,
they'd sideline me,

42:22.278 --> 42:24.106
send you to a military site.

42:24.150 --> 42:26.195
I wanted to be the one
who proved it.

42:26.239 --> 42:29.851
At least I thought I did.

42:29.895 --> 42:32.332
Kind of a waste
of a life, though.

42:33.986 --> 42:35.596
Maybe not.

42:35.640 --> 42:37.467
My species...

42:37.511 --> 42:40.514
we believe
in an ebb and flow to things.

42:41.646 --> 42:45.171
That our destinies run
apart and together.

42:45.214 --> 42:47.956
And that time is not

42:48.000 --> 42:50.568
what we think it is.

42:50.611 --> 42:54.180
And that some moments are
meant to happen.

42:54.223 --> 42:56.574
Even at great cost.

42:57.836 --> 43:00.403
Perhaps you had to be that boy.

43:00.447 --> 43:03.493
So I could be this man here

43:03.537 --> 43:05.408
letting you go?

43:08.673 --> 43:10.457
Something to think about.

43:16.028 --> 43:19.031
You two should get moving.

43:22.991 --> 43:26.299
I never thought
I'd say this, but I...

43:26.342 --> 43:29.650
almost can't wait to meet you.

43:36.875 --> 43:39.529
Your primitive satellites are
excruciatingly slow.

43:39.573 --> 43:41.009
What do you want?

43:41.053 --> 43:42.576
Mm, faster satellite.

43:42.620 --> 43:45.927
You're quite famous in a version
of where I come from.

43:45.971 --> 43:47.450
But your potential is wavering.

43:47.494 --> 43:49.757
Who else has more
to gain or lose right now

43:49.801 --> 43:51.324
-than Adam Soong?

43:51.367 --> 43:53.718
Nothing more to lose,
I'm afraid.

43:53.761 --> 43:55.937
Only a legacy.

43:55.981 --> 43:58.200
He took everything.

43:58.244 --> 43:59.854
You'll get over it.

43:59.898 --> 44:01.464
You're currently

44:01.508 --> 44:04.293
at a fork in the proverbial
road-- two futures.

44:04.337 --> 44:06.121
One leads to you
bringing humanity

44:06.165 --> 44:07.819
back from the edge
of extinction.

44:07.862 --> 44:10.560
They will call you
"the father of the future."

44:10.604 --> 44:13.563
Your statues will grace
capitols.

44:14.347 --> 44:16.915
Or you die alone, no glory.

44:16.958 --> 44:19.482
Forgotten in a pool
of your own 90-proof vomit.

44:19.526 --> 44:22.485
How do I, uh...

44:22.529 --> 44:24.487
guarantee that other path?

44:24.531 --> 44:26.489
Renée Picard either boards
a spaceship and makes

44:26.533 --> 44:29.014
a discovery that renders
your work obsolete.

44:29.057 --> 44:31.407
Or...

44:31.451 --> 44:33.148
doesn't.

44:33.192 --> 44:34.802
If she doesn't,

44:34.846 --> 44:36.499
I've seen the result.

44:36.543 --> 44:38.327
Earth in your time finds itself

44:38.371 --> 44:40.721
in ecological freefall.

44:40.765 --> 44:42.897
The man they turn to...

44:42.941 --> 44:44.725
is you.

44:44.769 --> 44:47.075
If only you're given
the opportunity.

44:47.119 --> 44:49.251
You lose a daughter,

44:49.295 --> 44:52.385
but become godfather to a world.

44:53.212 --> 44:55.867
Any moral tethers
I should know of?

44:56.781 --> 44:59.348
I can get us
into Mission Control.

44:59.392 --> 45:01.829
First things first.

45:01.873 --> 45:04.005
There's a man
who will stand in your way

45:04.049 --> 45:06.442
as he know stands in mine.

45:06.486 --> 45:08.880
-Picard?
-Very good.

45:08.923 --> 45:11.143
Here's the arrangement.

45:11.186 --> 45:12.927
Goddamn it, Picard!
Where have you been?

45:12.971 --> 45:16.061
-Uh...
-Never mind. Rios says
the transporter's jammed.

45:16.104 --> 45:17.932
The interrupt code is Borg.

45:17.976 --> 45:20.369
Jurati.

45:20.413 --> 45:23.024
I can get you face-to-face
with him in a matter of minutes.

45:23.068 --> 45:24.722
I can also provide you with...

45:24.765 --> 45:26.549
appropriate means
to dispose of him.

45:26.593 --> 45:29.161
She's with Soong.

45:29.204 --> 45:31.337
-And we know
where she's heading.
-There's only one reason

45:31.380 --> 45:33.426
Jurati would want
to take over the transporter.

45:35.384 --> 45:37.169
What do you need from me?

45:37.212 --> 45:38.692
Your records indicate

45:38.736 --> 45:41.347
you have access to
the raw ingredients I require.

45:41.390 --> 45:43.392
Once I have the ship,

45:43.436 --> 45:45.133
you can have your legacy.

45:45.177 --> 45:48.223
The Queen is coming
for La Sirena.

45:48.267 --> 45:50.225
She wants a 400-year jump-start

45:50.269 --> 45:52.837
on assimilating the galaxy.

45:52.880 --> 45:55.143
We have to defend that ship

45:55.187 --> 45:57.145
if we are to make our way home.

45:57.189 --> 46:00.453
We'll use Tallinn's transporter.
Let's go.

46:02.847 --> 46:04.370
Good luck.

46:06.111 --> 46:08.722
And you, my friend.

46:11.290 --> 46:14.249
She'll be assimilation ready,
be sure of that.

46:19.298 --> 46:21.387
So if she's coming for the ship,

46:21.430 --> 46:23.824
she's not coming alone.

46:23.868 --> 46:26.044
Thank you, General.

46:26.087 --> 46:28.786
They look perfectly adequate.

46:30.135 --> 46:32.659
Spearhead Operations.

46:33.486 --> 46:35.749
All of them are
ex-Special Forces.

46:35.793 --> 46:38.012
Best of the best.

46:38.056 --> 46:39.840
So...

46:39.884 --> 46:42.669
is someone gonna tell us
what the hell you want with us?

46:57.031 --> 46:58.641
Don't worry.

46:58.685 --> 47:01.253
It only stings for a moment.

47:05.692 --> 47:08.695
Who's in the mood to add
a little of their biological

47:08.738 --> 47:11.654
and technological
distinctiveness to our own?
