WEBVTT

00:02.336 --> 00:04.099
Sarah, we make a family.

00:05.606 --> 00:08.302
Helena does have a soul, she does have a purpose

00:08.408 --> 00:09.670
and she is part of our family now.

00:09.810 --> 00:11.801
Go back to hell where you belong.

00:12.713 --> 00:13.737
Shit!

00:14.248 --> 00:15.715
Henrik!

00:16.049 --> 00:17.516
I'm sick, Delphine.

00:17.584 --> 00:18.573
Are you my dad?

00:18.685 --> 00:20.516
Where's my niece? You left her with Cal?

00:20.587 --> 00:22.316
Your mom has a lot going on right now.

00:22.556 --> 00:25.218
"This organism is restricted
intellectual property."

00:25.425 --> 00:26.414
They patented us?

00:26.527 --> 00:28.757
Project LEDA.
I mean, its total military speak.

00:28.829 --> 00:31.161
You know the mythology of Leda and the Swan?

00:31.265 --> 00:33.733
Six scientists incinerated in a lab explosion.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.062
FELIX: These were Rachel's parents.

00:35.168 --> 00:37.033
Susan and Ethan Duncan.
They were geneticists.

00:37.137 --> 00:38.104
<i>I love you, too.</i>

00:38.205 --> 00:40.070
You're not really the smartest clone, are you?

00:40.173 --> 00:42.300
Smart enough to know you're shagging Rachel.

00:42.776 --> 00:46.007
I shot you! You were dead.
You were dead!

00:46.079 --> 00:48.070
They took something from inside of me.

00:48.415 --> 00:50.508
HENRIK: And a new life begins.

01:00.961 --> 01:03.122
Rachel, uh, you don't need to see this.

01:03.297 --> 01:05.424
I demanded to. Now, move.

01:21.648 --> 01:23.707
I'd like to see him, please.

01:40.667 --> 01:43.602
LEEKIE: I'm sorry, Rachel.
Daniel was a very loyal man.

01:44.404 --> 01:47.032
- To you.
- To us both.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.096
This wasn't Sarah.

01:49.910 --> 01:51.036
No.

01:52.012 --> 01:54.139
I believe we all recognise the handiwork.

01:57.050 --> 01:58.347
Your white whale, Aldous.

01:58.452 --> 01:59.749
Seems we have a pair of them.

02:00.253 --> 02:02.721
Security footage shows her leaving with Sarah.

02:03.256 --> 02:04.518
The twins are back together.

02:05.192 --> 02:06.591
Fascinating, actually.

02:06.693 --> 02:08.592
If one can rise above it, Rachel.

02:08.695 --> 02:09.684
(WHISPERS)
Animals...

02:09.763 --> 02:11.196
How was Taiwan, Paul?

02:11.264 --> 02:13.459
- You two get along?
- He performed admirably.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.328
- I did my job.
- Huh.

02:15.402 --> 02:17.768
- Personal security, was it?
- That's right.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.314
ALDOUS: She could have
killed you, you know.

02:28.548 --> 02:29.640
Thank you for your concern.

02:30.250 --> 02:32.775
There's a kinder, gentler way, Rachel.

02:32.886 --> 02:35.582
This is all the result of your
heavy-handed tactics.

02:35.689 --> 02:38.522
Trust me, Aldous, I've only just begun.

03:21.368 --> 03:24.462
You do realise I'm going to have to
paint this to come to terms with it?

03:24.838 --> 03:25.827
Please don't.

03:26.273 --> 03:27.297
Yeah, you're right.

03:27.474 --> 03:29.704
I mean, you shot your evil twin sister dead,

03:29.810 --> 03:31.675
only to have her arise and gut Rachel's henchman.

03:31.745 --> 03:33.337
How could I capture the nuance?

03:33.447 --> 03:35.347
Yeah, believe me, you couldn't.

03:35.449 --> 03:37.713
You are now pitted between two psychopaths.

03:38.251 --> 03:39.343
Cut her loose.

03:39.453 --> 03:40.715
If she hadn't shown up, I'd be dead.

03:40.787 --> 03:42.687
She can't stay here, Sarah. She's not...

03:42.756 --> 03:46.089
Oi, just, just...
Just get her something to wear, please.

03:46.159 --> 03:47.524
Fine.

03:49.329 --> 03:52.321
I'm sure I've got a Ukrainian
folk costume in here somewhere.

03:52.399 --> 03:53.525
- (SNARLS)
- Oh! God.

03:53.767 --> 03:55.200
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

03:55.268 --> 03:57.429
You treat him with respect.

03:57.804 --> 03:59.203
You got it? That's my brother.

03:59.272 --> 04:01.001
Which means he's one of our sisters.

04:01.174 --> 04:02.163
Family.

04:02.275 --> 04:03.503
You get it, meathead?

04:04.211 --> 04:05.610
Do not call me this.

04:06.012 --> 04:07.604
Do you understand, Helena?

04:09.716 --> 04:10.705
He is <i>sestra</i>.

04:10.817 --> 04:12.546
- Oh, God.
- Exactly.

04:12.853 --> 04:15.754
So take some clothes, wash up

04:15.856 --> 04:17.824
and do everything that he tells you to.

04:20.327 --> 04:21.817
Thank you, Felix.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.754
Just don't kill my rubber ducky.

04:25.766 --> 04:26.755
Jesus!

04:27.801 --> 04:29.962
What did those fish cult freaks do to her?

04:30.637 --> 04:33.231
I don't know, she wouldn't say.

04:33.707 --> 04:36.301
But I know somebody who can handle her,
maybe he can find out.

04:36.443 --> 04:38.877
- I just need you to chaperone her.
- Oh, God.

04:39.246 --> 04:42.010
If you would, while I get my shit together, please.

04:42.415 --> 04:45.316
You are truly unbelievable.

04:47.854 --> 04:50.152
Take this, go talk to your daughter.

04:50.257 --> 04:51.224
Thank you.

04:54.594 --> 04:56.289
These socks are wet.

04:56.730 --> 04:57.719
What?

04:58.532 --> 05:00.966
Agreed. Those are wet socks.

05:01.268 --> 05:02.667
Hey, you want to wear my socks?

05:02.769 --> 05:04.600
They're pretty cool, they're grey.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.563
And they'll be like knee-highs on you.

05:07.240 --> 05:08.468
(LAUGHS)
No.

05:08.575 --> 05:09.633
You know what?

05:09.709 --> 05:10.698
Good call.

05:10.844 --> 05:13.278
You're going to need more than big socks this morning.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.748
I know this has been all...

05:16.850 --> 05:19.910
sort of confusing, Kira.
I don't blame you for being put out.

05:20.587 --> 05:23.078
But since we're stuck in this together,

05:23.657 --> 05:25.750
there's no reason why we shouldn't have a little fun.

05:26.126 --> 05:30.085
And there's no reason why we shouldn't
have really awesome socks.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.152
Right?

05:32.999 --> 05:34.660
Sit, please, Paul.

05:38.705 --> 05:40.263
I'm in need of a new monitor.

05:41.474 --> 05:43.704
- You have a monitor?
- She did.

05:44.010 --> 05:44.999
Daniel.

05:45.145 --> 05:47.113
I <i>'</i> ve been self-aware
since I was a child.

05:47.247 --> 05:49.841
I'm not exempt from the programme.

05:49.916 --> 05:53.682
I simply enjoy a unique vantage, one with privilege.

05:53.753 --> 05:55.584
She needs full-time personal security.

05:55.755 --> 05:57.655
And you submit data to me

05:57.724 --> 06:00.352
on her health and wellbeing, like any other subject.

06:00.427 --> 06:03.954
Are you asking me if I'm interested
or reminding me I have no choice?

06:04.030 --> 06:05.463
It's a promotion, Paul.

06:06.066 --> 06:08.660
A very handsome one, if you have the starch for it.

06:11.838 --> 06:14.602
Where are you with the new stem cell line, Aldous?

06:14.975 --> 06:17.466
My in-vitro tests have been
very promising.

06:18.411 --> 06:20.436
Promising enough to treat Cosima.

06:21.915 --> 06:23.075
Shut down the tests.

06:24.784 --> 06:26.445
Until Sarah comes to heel,

06:27.520 --> 06:28.544
Cosima will suffer.

06:31.057 --> 06:33.025
<i>Back in the early '80s, genetics was like the wild west.</i>

06:33.126 --> 06:34.616
<i>No one knew the science.</i>

06:34.895 --> 06:38.228
<i>The laws didn't exist, so they slapped</i>
<i>provisional patents on everything.</i>

06:38.331 --> 06:39.992
Like pissing on a fencepost.

06:40.133 --> 06:42.829
Yeah. Like, leave it in legal limbo
until the laws change

06:42.936 --> 06:44.563
or you can figure out if it's worth anything.

06:45.038 --> 06:46.903
They would still have to register them, though, right?

06:47.007 --> 06:49.237
<i>Back then anything as advanced as synthetic DNA</i>

06:49.309 --> 06:51.539
<i>would be probably have fallen under the military somehow.</i>

06:51.678 --> 06:53.111
If Dyad was just a contractor,

06:53.246 --> 06:54.907
it could be a secret military patent.

06:55.282 --> 06:56.874
Hmm. That makes sense.

06:57.317 --> 06:58.909
Wait. How would I...
How would I find that out?

06:59.085 --> 07:03.112
<i>I guess you wait until a guy in aviators</i>
<i>shows up and tells you're in violation?</i>

07:03.356 --> 07:06.757
Scott, you're supposed to be my expert
on genetic patents here.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.291
<i>I just blog about it.</i>

07:08.395 --> 07:10.989
<i>Why can't I come work for</i>
<i>you on this super-sensitive shit?</i>

07:11.231 --> 07:14.325
Delphine, why can't Scott come and work
with us on the super-sensitive shit?

07:15.001 --> 07:16.593
Because we'd have to kill his family.

07:17.070 --> 07:18.059
You hear that?

07:18.171 --> 07:20.230
<i>That's fine. I applied</i>
<i>with a letter from the Dean.</i>

07:20.974 --> 07:23.374
Hi, Scott. Bye, Scott.

07:24.644 --> 07:25.633
He's so cute.

07:25.712 --> 07:26.804
Did you get these?

07:27.247 --> 07:28.236
What?

07:28.949 --> 07:31.144
They're tissue test results from the stem cell line.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.650
One that I've never seen before.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.111
And they are...

07:34.487 --> 07:35.476
What?

07:36.089 --> 07:38.148
Compatible. With you.

07:40.560 --> 07:41.549
Really?

07:41.695 --> 07:45.062
But they were sent to me by mistake.
They were meant for Leekie.

07:47.334 --> 07:49.632
He's supposed to share all the science with us.

07:49.769 --> 07:51.134
Why don't we have these cultures?

07:51.871 --> 07:52.895
I don't know.

07:54.007 --> 07:56.373
Because they're experimental or proprietary.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.736
That doesn't matter. I'll try anything.

07:58.912 --> 08:00.846
So will I.

08:03.950 --> 08:05.508
- Where are you?
- SARAH: <i>I'm, uh...</i>

08:05.685 --> 08:07.744
I'm in a place where bands play.

08:08.088 --> 08:09.555
KIRA: <i>What bands?</i>

08:10.090 --> 08:12.320
I don't know, Bobby?
Who"s playing tonight?

08:12.559 --> 08:13.821
The Shit Goblins.

08:16.029 --> 08:18.224
<i>Sorry! Sorry.</i>

08:19.165 --> 08:20.462
I miss you, monkey.

08:20.567 --> 08:22.057
<i>I'm not a monkey any more</i>.

08:22.168 --> 08:23.157
You're not?

08:23.236 --> 08:24.260
I'm a leopard.

08:24.371 --> 08:25.360
<i>Cool!</i>

08:25.438 --> 08:27.702
Yeah. Wow, I like the jacket, too.

08:28.108 --> 08:29.507
You can talk to daddy now.

08:29.776 --> 08:32.506
Hey! Monkey... Kira?

08:35.081 --> 08:36.105
(SIGHS)
Daddy.

08:36.950 --> 08:39.578
Sorry about that.
I keep telling her it's Cal.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.448
But she Daddied me twice this morning.

08:42.589 --> 08:45.080
She can call you what she wants.
It's fine.

08:45.158 --> 08:46.284
<i>You sure you're okay?</i>

08:46.426 --> 08:48.485
<i>Mind if we don't get into it?</i>

08:48.561 --> 08:49.960
A little.

08:50.230 --> 08:52.130
<i>Fine. How about this, then?</i>

08:52.198 --> 08:54.996
That guy, um, you crashed into.

08:55.068 --> 08:57.366
<i>Yeah. That Dyad gentleman?</i>

08:57.437 --> 08:59.405
Yeah. Well, he didn't... He didn't die.

09:00.440 --> 09:01.805
Not by your hand.

09:02.909 --> 09:05.639
I'm relieved, you know. Ostensibly.

09:07.714 --> 09:08.703
<i>Where are you guys?</i>

09:08.815 --> 09:10.544
Close enough to grab you when you're ready.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.745
I look forward to that.

09:15.722 --> 09:18.486
All right, best behaviour,
little...<i>sestra.</i>

09:22.495 --> 09:24.326
Hello again, Detective Bell.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.386
Inside.

09:32.205 --> 09:33.297
Hands on the table.

09:33.807 --> 09:35.206
I don't like to be touched.

09:35.275 --> 09:36.674
Yeah? Well, that's too bad.

09:36.776 --> 09:40.109
I just gave her new clothes. She didn't
have any weapons or anything like...

09:42.482 --> 09:43.471
That's my pen.

09:44.651 --> 09:45.879
I wanted to write letter.

09:45.985 --> 09:48.146
I haven't forgotten that you took a shot at me.

09:48.321 --> 09:49.447
(GIGGLES)

09:49.522 --> 09:50.580
Give me your hands.

09:50.690 --> 09:52.487
Do as he says, meathead.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.152
The windows are a
30-foot drop to concrete.

09:55.228 --> 09:56.957
All sharp objects have been locked away.

09:57.130 --> 09:59.223
The only way in and out of here is through me.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.432
So in other words...

10:02.435 --> 10:04.562
- You're safe here.
- Look, Helena,

10:04.804 --> 10:06.897
he wants to help you and Sarah.

10:07.273 --> 10:09.002
He lies down with pigs.

10:10.009 --> 10:12.000
(SNORTING)

10:12.912 --> 10:14.709
And that's my cue to leave.

10:15.548 --> 10:16.913
I've got a hot date, too.

10:17.550 --> 10:20.678
Um, good luck with... that.

10:22.755 --> 10:25.588
Oh, um... Try food.

10:29.095 --> 10:32.155
Gracie won't talk and so she
remains until she admits the truth.

10:32.232 --> 10:33.426
Are you sure she's lying?

10:33.533 --> 10:34.557
We both know.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.569
If she won't open her heart to Helena,
then she's clinging to the old ways.

10:37.837 --> 10:40.431
A punishment to fit the crime, Henrik.

10:40.507 --> 10:41.872
It's been 12 hours.

10:46.613 --> 10:47.671
Well...

10:54.687 --> 10:58.179
Gracie, you ready to tell us what
really happened with Helena?

11:04.831 --> 11:06.162
She can rot.

11:21.247 --> 11:23.477
<i>Well, I'm going to have to come after you and tickle you!</i>

11:23.650 --> 11:25.447
- <i>Here I come, the tickle monster!</i>
- (SHRIEKS)

11:25.518 --> 11:27.577
<i>- Oh, no!</i>
- (LAUGHING)

11:27.854 --> 11:31.051
- <i>Thanks, Mummy. I love you.</i>
<i>- What about poor Daddy?</i>

11:31.191 --> 11:32.351
<i>I love you, too, Daddy.</i>

11:32.926 --> 11:35.486
<i>Now, go get...</i>

11:35.929 --> 11:38.193
Sarah's trying to learn everything about me.

11:38.264 --> 11:39.788
Just as I am with her.

11:43.236 --> 11:45.101
I want us to be clear, Paul.

11:46.039 --> 11:50.772
As my monitor, you report my data
to Aldous but you work for me.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.671
Do you understand?

11:52.745 --> 11:53.905
Not exactly.

11:58.651 --> 12:00.983
I've known Leekie my entire life.

12:01.788 --> 12:05.884
When my adoptive parents died, he
became something of a guardian to me.

12:07.327 --> 12:10.023
But now my position in the corporation

12:10.129 --> 12:12.563
essentially outranks his Dyad directorship.

12:13.766 --> 12:16.564
He can become too attached to his subjects,

12:16.636 --> 12:17.967
myself included.

12:18.805 --> 12:20.830
Sometimes he can't make the hard choices.

12:23.176 --> 12:25.076
Did you read the report on Cal Morrison?

12:25.144 --> 12:27.635
Made his money in micro-optics.
May have anti-corporate leanings.

12:28.414 --> 12:29.847
What is it you're looking for?

12:30.049 --> 12:32.916
I want to know if he's the other side
of Kira <i>'</i> s biological equation.

12:32.986 --> 12:35.546
The timeline works. We can place him
with Sarah eight years ago.

12:38.124 --> 12:39.614
Does that bother you?

12:40.994 --> 12:43.292
That Sarah is back with the father of her child?

12:44.297 --> 12:45.321
No.

12:50.536 --> 12:54.370
Up until now, your entanglements with
Sarah have been your saving grace, Paul.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.270
I never asked her to cross my path.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.136
You didn't ask for me, either.

13:02.749 --> 13:04.944
But now it's time to make a decision, Paul.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.051
This is Dan...

13:09.122 --> 13:10.646
This was Daniel's gun.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.884
It can be tied to the murder of a police officer.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.596
There's no middle ground any more.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.261

Hey!

13:33.946 --> 13:36.312
Maggie Chen. Also a Prolethean.

13:36.949 --> 13:40.248
She was your spotter.
She tracked down clones for you.

13:41.187 --> 13:42.916
The two of you worked together.

13:44.057 --> 13:45.820
The thing is, last time I saw you,

13:46.025 --> 13:49.188
you were running away from Johanssen's
followers in a wedding dress.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.027
You want to tell me what that was all about?

14:03.009 --> 14:03.998
What did they do to you?

14:07.747 --> 14:09.009
BELL: <i>What did they do to you?</i>

14:13.453 --> 14:15.353
How did Maggie find the clones?

14:16.356 --> 14:18.517
How did she communicate with you?

14:31.204 --> 14:33.104
I am a very patient man, Helena.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.639
So, I'm going to just make me...

14:39.445 --> 14:41.413

14:41.481 --> 14:42.914

15:15.281 --> 15:16.805
Sorry I can't help you out of this.

15:18.284 --> 15:20.184
Your dad's sending me after Helena.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.345
She's got to carry the child, right?

15:23.956 --> 15:24.945
Gracie...

15:26.392 --> 15:28.189
I don't know if she's a miracle or not

15:28.327 --> 15:31.160
but if something happened, just confess.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.155
Confession heals all.

15:56.189 --> 15:58.783
It doesn't matter to me what you did.

16:18.878 --> 16:20.709
When I was seven,

16:20.813 --> 16:23.907
the nuns said I had devils inside me.

16:25.084 --> 16:27.143
Sister Olga locked me in cellar.

16:29.522 --> 16:30.784
She gave me darkness.

16:31.791 --> 16:32.780
But...

16:34.126 --> 16:36.754
I gave her darkness.

16:39.232 --> 16:40.927
Does Sarah know of Swan Man?

16:42.401 --> 16:44.198
I don't think so.

16:45.304 --> 16:46.635
Swan Man played God.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.305
How'd he do that?

16:53.079 --> 16:54.273
He's in her locker.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.713
Whose locker? Maggie's?

16:57.517 --> 16:59.246
Why does Rachel want Sarah?

16:59.685 --> 17:00.947
Is it for Kira, too?

17:01.354 --> 17:03.584
Does Maggie Chen have a locker?

17:05.090 --> 17:06.683
How does this help my <i>sestra</i> ?

17:06.759 --> 17:08.556

This is really important.

Aldous,

23:44.056 --> 23:45.887
you held back a stem cell line from us.

In fact, I didn't.

23:48.394 --> 23:51.158

24:00.205 --> 24:01.194
In a word,

24:01.607 --> 24:02.596
Sarah.

24:04.510 --> 24:06.307
You seen this before?

24:09.114 --> 24:10.103
Who are they?

24:10.282 --> 24:12.443
Two forefathers of the original experiment.

24:13.552 --> 24:14.951
This was in Sarah's possession.

24:16.155 --> 24:19.613
I'm going to tell you something
that only a handful of people know.

24:21.327 --> 24:23.955
Twenty years ago, there was a fire in one of our labs.

24:24.330 --> 24:27.356
Several scientists died.
Reams of data lost.

24:27.433 --> 24:30.061
And the original genome was destroyed.

24:31.003 --> 24:33.563
So all of this secrecy around the original genome

24:33.706 --> 24:35.401
is because it doesn't exist?

24:36.275 --> 24:37.503
Yes.

24:37.810 --> 24:39.744
The entire project is essentially an orphan.

24:40.879 --> 24:44.542
We lost your pre-history, Cosima.
And with it, all record

24:44.650 --> 24:47.983
of several synthetic sequences embedded in your DNA.

24:48.721 --> 24:50.245
What kind of synthetic sequences?

24:51.690 --> 24:53.123
Sequences that make you possible.

24:54.159 --> 24:57.754
That overcame the viability issues
that have haunted us ever since.

24:57.830 --> 24:59.388
So you lost the map.

24:59.832 --> 25:04.235
So finding the sequence in the genome
is like looking for hay in a haystack.

25:04.536 --> 25:07.630
So you see, if Sarah has uncovered something,

25:08.240 --> 25:09.366
I need to know.

25:10.309 --> 25:11.469
I have no idea.

25:14.213 --> 25:15.646
Whether I believe that or not,

25:16.615 --> 25:20.107
as a gesture of good faith,
I'm willing to disregard Rachel

26:31.657 --> 26:34.148
You don't mind if I take a look inside the RV?

26:35.561 --> 26:36.892
Trick-or-treat!

26:37.496 --> 26:38.485
Whoa! (LAUGHING)

26:38.797 --> 26:40.025
Halloween's over, kiddo.

26:40.399 --> 26:43.232
I know, but you're burning dinner again.

26:43.335 --> 26:46.236
Oh, right, but it... It gives the food
a nice smoky flavour.

26:46.371 --> 26:47.497
KIRA: No, it doesn't.

26:49.208 --> 26:52.644
She, uh, she went as some video game character.

26:54.847 --> 26:58.339
All right. I'll let you guys
have your supper. Goodnight.

26:58.450 --> 26:59.917
Goodnight.

27:04.990 --> 27:07.356
You're quick on your feet, aren't you?

27:17.002 --> 27:18.162
- Oh, shit!
- Ah.

27:18.270 --> 27:19.294
She escaped?

27:19.404 --> 27:22.373
Yeah! Can you pass me
the goddamn keys? On the fish tank.

27:23.041 --> 27:24.065
Yeah.

27:24.510 --> 27:26.444
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.547
- Not this again?
- Yeah.

27:30.649 --> 27:31.877
More riddles from your sister.

27:31.950 --> 27:33.076
Well, how does it work?

27:33.252 --> 27:34.844
Last time they were GPS coordinates.

27:35.654 --> 27:38.680
Three places we'd been,
one we hadn't. Let <i>'</i> s go.

27:57.776 --> 27:59.607
This matches her coordinates, what do you think?

28:01.013 --> 28:02.503
She said something about a locker.

28:14.526 --> 28:16.187
Helena?

28:16.295 --> 28:18.024
Don't jump out and scare us

28:18.697 --> 28:20.221
with an axe or some shit.

28:23.368 --> 28:24.835
She likes bikes, right?

28:24.937 --> 28:25.904
Yeah.

28:26.004 --> 28:27.028
I think she rode off on one.

28:28.006 --> 28:31.237
Oh, why the hell would she send us here?
What does she want?

28:32.511 --> 28:33.500
SARAH: Hey.

28:39.184 --> 28:40.913
I think this is Maggie Chen's locker.

28:41.987 --> 28:44.888
She must have used it as a drop
for information for Helena.

28:46.792 --> 28:49.784
She camped out here. What a sad life.

29:23.962 --> 29:25.224
Swan Man.

29:26.331 --> 29:28.390
- What?
- Swan Man.

29:30.402 --> 29:32.802
Helena said that might mean something to you.

29:34.273 --> 29:36.434
So, ah, Swan... Leda and the Swan.

29:36.908 --> 29:38.102
And Project LEDA.

29:38.210 --> 29:39.643
She said he was playing God.

29:42.814 --> 29:44.145
Could that be the same man?

29:46.318 --> 29:48.343
This photo's like 1977?

29:48.787 --> 29:50.084
So, he'd be, what?

29:50.555 --> 29:51.544
In his '70s now?

29:51.990 --> 29:53.685
Yeah... Yeah, could be.

29:53.759 --> 29:54.748
Shit.

29:56.194 --> 29:57.786
Well, it could mean that

29:57.896 --> 29:59.727
our creators, one of them,

30:00.465 --> 30:01.523
Rachel's dad,

30:02.234 --> 30:04.759
he could still be alive,
he didn't die in the lab explosion.

30:05.003 --> 30:06.493
I need to call Cosima.

30:07.272 --> 30:10.400
This is something I can use.
Something I can trade for Felix.

30:13.645 --> 30:14.634
BELL: Sarah...

30:15.113 --> 30:16.102
What?

30:22.120 --> 30:23.314
Sniper rifle.

30:39.771 --> 30:41.636
She's going to kill Rachel.

30:43.508 --> 30:45.499
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

30:51.616 --> 30:52.674
Paul...

30:57.889 --> 30:59.880
'63 Margaux.

31:00.425 --> 31:02.222
Two glasses.

31:03.929 --> 31:05.556
(HUMMING)

31:09.468 --> 31:12.904
A little more off the back, Helena.

31:14.206 --> 31:16.572
Yes, Rachel. Of course.

31:17.209 --> 31:18.471
So pretty you are.

31:19.010 --> 31:20.910
So much money,

31:21.813 --> 31:23.440
so much money.

32:00.552 --> 32:01.849
Put it down.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.524
Take off your shirt.

32:18.837 --> 32:22.000
- She's got about a 20-minute lead on us.
- We're close to Rachel's.

32:22.073 --> 32:23.563
I tell you, she's fast.

32:30.515 --> 32:31.743
Don't move.

32:34.453 --> 32:36.114
Take off your pants.

33:25.370 --> 33:27.395
Daniel like that?

33:27.672 --> 33:28.832
Did Sarah?

33:29.608 --> 33:30.905
Hey! What's that?

33:31.643 --> 33:32.632
What?

33:32.744 --> 33:33.870
Hey. Stop. Stop.

33:34.446 --> 33:36.812
- Hey, hey, hey. Hold up.
- That's her bike.

33:37.482 --> 33:39.006
And that's Rachel's building right there.

33:39.651 --> 33:41.243
Wait, what side is Rachel's suite on?

33:41.686 --> 33:43.586
It faces this way.

33:44.089 --> 33:45.522
That's a clear line of sight for a sniper.

33:46.758 --> 33:47.884
Come on.

33:51.830 --> 33:53.525
Get that chair.

34:11.416 --> 34:12.746
Take those off.

34:23.228 --> 34:24.286
Sit down.

34:33.237 --> 34:35.034
You like my hair, Paul?

34:35.239 --> 34:39.301
Yeah. Very pretty, dirty, sexy Rachel.

34:39.811 --> 34:41.438
Like my mother.

34:52.456 --> 34:54.687
- Hello, <i>sestra.</i>
- Helena, stop.

34:54.893 --> 34:57.020
Helena, put the gun down.

34:57.228 --> 35:00.197
Mind your weapon, Art, or I pull trigger.

35:00.265 --> 35:02.028
(GRUNTING)

35:03.735 --> 35:05.032
Come see, Sarah.

35:07.272 --> 35:08.261
Okay.

35:13.411 --> 35:15.402
Helena, you can't do this.

35:16.281 --> 35:17.339
You can't.

35:17.449 --> 35:19.940
Rachel is problem. I fix problem.

35:20.118 --> 35:21.449
I wish you could.

35:21.686 --> 35:23.779
But they've got Felix.

35:24.990 --> 35:27.288
- Brother-<i>sestra</i>.
- He's in jail.

35:27.425 --> 35:30.189
If you kill Rachel, they're going to keep him there.

35:32.497 --> 35:33.464
Look.

35:35.433 --> 35:36.593
Look, Sarah.

35:37.636 --> 35:38.625
Okay.

35:45.377 --> 35:47.709
Always unfaithful.

35:47.812 --> 35:49.109
I don't care about Paul.

35:50.615 --> 35:52.606
He doesn't matter any more.

35:52.951 --> 35:54.919
- Then I kill him for it.
- No, Helena, stop!

35:54.986 --> 35:57.477
Take your finger off the trigger and put down the gun.

35:57.555 --> 35:58.852
No, just...

35:58.923 --> 35:59.912
- Let's see who's faster.
- Please.

35:59.991 --> 36:00.980
I can't let her shoot.

36:03.294 --> 36:06.991
Helena, listen to me.
There's another way.

36:07.065 --> 36:10.125
We can make a deal for Felix but I need your help.

36:11.870 --> 36:13.895
Only you can help me find Swan Man.

36:15.407 --> 36:17.034
You only want to use me.

36:22.847 --> 36:23.836
No...

36:24.549 --> 36:27.279
That's not true. You saved my life.

36:28.086 --> 36:29.883
You... You're my sister.

36:30.989 --> 36:33.514
Helena, I thought...
I thought I'd killed you.

36:36.594 --> 36:39.085
I couldn't tell anybody what I lost.

36:41.332 --> 36:43.527
But you came back.

36:47.839 --> 36:50.000
Please, put... Put down the gun.

36:51.576 --> 36:52.668
Please.

37:04.556 --> 37:05.750
That's good.

37:09.360 --> 37:10.588
Come down.

37:21.072 --> 37:22.061
Thank you.

37:22.674 --> 37:24.574
You make me cry, <i>sestra.</i>

37:26.911 --> 37:28.902
Come on, meathead.

37:30.348 --> 37:31.474
Don't call me this.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.451
(INAUDIBLE)

38:15.293 --> 38:16.692
There we go.

38:17.762 --> 38:21.721
Just an intra-dermal test
to see how your body responds.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.734
Yeah, so if my arm falls off, then we know.

38:23.802 --> 38:24.860
(ALL LAUGHING)

38:24.969 --> 38:26.300
Or if you grow another limb.

38:26.404 --> 38:28.497
- Yeah.
- (BOTH LAUGH)

38:30.208 --> 38:34.474
Um... Oh, Dr Leekie, in light of
what you shared with us earlier,

38:35.113 --> 38:36.637
we have a proposition for you.

38:37.015 --> 38:38.039
We do?

38:38.683 --> 38:40.116
No, no. Not us.

38:40.718 --> 38:42.652
Um, us.

38:44.789 --> 38:45.847
I <i>'</i> m all ears.

38:46.157 --> 38:47.181
We want to know...

38:49.127 --> 38:50.754
Do you like to drink beer?

38:51.696 --> 38:52.685
Hmm?

38:55.967 --> 38:56.956
Thank you.

38:58.136 --> 38:59.899
Dr Leekie?

39:02.974 --> 39:03.963
Sarah?

39:04.075 --> 39:06.543
So I hear I'm not the only data you lost.

39:06.845 --> 39:09.006
You have something for me?

39:12.917 --> 39:14.316
Professor Ethan Duncan.

39:14.919 --> 39:16.045
Alive.

39:17.856 --> 39:18.948
Where?

39:19.057 --> 39:20.991
It's vital my brother goes free.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.160
All charges dropped.

39:24.896 --> 39:27.956
Find him, I can pull the levers to countermand Rachel

39:28.132 --> 39:30.566
and guarantee Cosima will be able
to continue the treatment.

39:31.236 --> 39:32.567
What, what treatment?

39:33.404 --> 39:34.393
Ah.

39:35.306 --> 39:37.467
So you don't share everything.

39:37.575 --> 39:38.769
What?

39:39.510 --> 39:41.341
What, is she sick?

39:41.813 --> 39:43.940
Unfortunately, yes.

39:46.284 --> 39:48.775
With what? With what Katja had?

39:49.687 --> 39:50.745
I'll let her explain.

39:50.855 --> 39:52.914
But all the more reason to find Duncan.

39:54.492 --> 39:55.720
I can buy you three days.

39:56.294 --> 39:57.693
If anybody follows us,

39:58.162 --> 40:00.255
I'm gonna stick Helena on all of you.

40:00.531 --> 40:02.795
- Not an idle threat.
- No, it's not.

40:06.771 --> 40:08.671
PAUL: Well, that looked interesting.

40:13.878 --> 40:15.470
Rachel had you follow me.

40:15.546 --> 40:17.878
She thought you might make a deal
with Sarah behind her back.

40:17.949 --> 40:20.577
Well, Sarah's off on a trip down memory lane.

40:20.752 --> 40:21.844
And so am I.

40:21.920 --> 40:24.445
What she finds there may be dangerous to us all, Paul.

40:24.722 --> 40:27.088
So I need you to come to me first.

40:27.158 --> 40:30.218
- Before Rachel.
- I'll be in touch.

40:37.568 --> 40:39.536
Right. So, how do we find Swan Man?

40:41.839 --> 40:43.238
Mrs S has nice truck.

40:43.975 --> 40:44.999
Much like rooms.

40:45.076 --> 40:46.703
Helena, where are we going?

40:47.745 --> 40:48.905
Cold River.

40:49.013 --> 40:50.810
What's that? A town?

40:52.216 --> 40:53.513
A place of screams.

40:56.187 --> 40:58.485
You act like you've never been in a car before.

40:58.589 --> 41:00.113
Never been on road trip.

41:00.191 --> 41:01.180
We're clones.

41:01.559 --> 41:04.187
I can't help but think that the godhead
has put you here to test me.

41:04.295 --> 41:06.855
Wondering how a simple guy like me meets a girl like you

41:06.965 --> 41:09.024
- in a place like this?
- On the floor!

41:10.068 --> 41:13.060
You knew all along.
You'rejust one of them, aren't you?

41:13.271 --> 41:14.704
Hello, Paul.
