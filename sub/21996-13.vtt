but he had it,

he came back

you cannot argue with.

is disturbing.

ZAK: This account of possession

04:22.329 --> 04:24.763

of oppressive power

04:24.765 --> 04:26.298

04:26.300 --> 04:28.767
and with every force
of this magnitude,

04:28.769 --> 04:31.670
there is always something
that unearthed it.

04:31.672 --> 04:33.672
Have you ever had a problem

04:33.674 --> 04:36.975
with satanic worshipers
in the buildings?

04:36.977 --> 04:38.477
Not since we've been here,

04:38.479 --> 04:41.713
but historically,
during the '80s,

04:41.715 --> 04:46.051
there was reports of people
breaking into the buildings...

04:46.053 --> 04:51.323
¶¶

04:51.325 --> 04:53.025
and doing satanic worship.

04:53.027 --> 04:55.160
They typically do them
in abandoned places...

04:55.162 --> 04:56.294
Mm-hmm.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.829
...where they can
do their rituals

04:57.831 --> 05:01.566
and not be bothered,
do sacrifices.

05:01.568 --> 05:03.568
So while there is something
in these buildings

05:03.570 --> 05:04.770
that could have been here

05:04.772 --> 05:07.305
before you started
the Halloween attraction,

05:07.307 --> 05:12.244
we have to go in here and see
exactly what this thing is,

05:12.246 --> 05:14.880
because if it is doing
these kinds of things,

05:14.882 --> 05:17.215
seizures, attachments,

05:17.217 --> 05:19.384

that you actually were

05:31.965 --> 05:34.633
a student here
at this school?

05:34.635 --> 05:37.235
Well, grade school.
I didn't go to college here.

05:37.237 --> 05:41.173
I started in '42 till
the school closed in '51.

05:41.175 --> 05:43.842
I was a sophomore
in high school.

05:43.844 --> 05:48.413
Just about 5 years
before you came here,

05:48.415 --> 05:52.050
there was a couple of boys
that died mysteriously.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.986
Oh, yeah.
They slept in the sheep camp,

05:54.988 --> 05:58.290
and the stove got to smoking
during the night,

05:58.292 --> 06:01.359
and they found them
both dead.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.228
So that's what they say,

06:03.230 --> 06:06.031
because when
they did the autopsy,

06:06.033 --> 06:08.066
as our research
indicates,

06:08.068 --> 06:11.570
it still says that
their deaths remain a mystery.

06:11.572 --> 06:14.873
Could the mysterious death
of these two students

06:14.875 --> 06:17.676
actually be the beginning
of the dark energy

06:17.678 --> 06:20.712
that is now festering
within these grounds?

06:20.714 --> 06:23.849

may have been influencing

06:23.851 --> 06:26.818

of the students here.

ever a reputation

about this place
being haunted then?

06:33.093 --> 06:34.526
-Yeah.
-There was?

06:34.528 --> 06:36.828
Yes.

06:36.830 --> 06:40.899
Well, during World War II,

06:40.901 --> 06:43.068
all the boys
were gone to war,

06:43.070 --> 06:45.036
and so there wasn't
enough students

06:45.038 --> 06:47.272
to keep the Miller Hall
building open,

06:47.274 --> 06:50.275
and so they closed it up.

06:50.277 --> 06:53.311
And there was a lot of rumors
about the ghost in Miller Hall.

06:53.313 --> 06:56.448
Really?
Did something happen there?

06:56.450 --> 07:00.185
They used it for a haunted house
one Halloween, and...

07:00.187 --> 07:01.653
Back in the '40s?

it got carried away.

have to fight it.

11:30.307 --> 11:32.607
Stop it.
Don't let it do this to you.

11:32.609 --> 11:33.875
So weird.
That's so weird.

11:33.877 --> 11:35.510
You know exactly
why it's happened.

11:35.512 --> 11:37.045
Right.

11:37.047 --> 11:39.714
Earlier, during our
communication session

11:39.716 --> 11:41.049
in the classroom,

11:41.051 --> 11:45.386
Aaron placed his hand directly
on the satanic symbol,

11:45.388 --> 11:47.622
when afterwards,
his hand began to burn,

11:47.624 --> 11:49.724
so much so that
our thermal camera

11:49.726 --> 11:53.595
documented the bright,
white heat of his left hand

11:53.597 --> 11:55.997
in comparison
to the other.

11:55.999 --> 11:58.366
Yeah. That hand is hotter
than the other one, Aaron.

11:58.368 --> 12:00.268
It hurts.

12:00.270 --> 12:04.639
I'm not coming here to see you
or anybody else get possessed

12:04.641 --> 12:06.674
and drop to the ground
and have a seizure.

12:06.676 --> 12:10.645
¶¶

12:10.647 --> 12:12.113
Let me just ask you.

12:12.115 --> 12:16.651
Is what we're experiencing
out of the norm?

12:16.653 --> 12:18.319
Are we really dealing
with something

12:18.321 --> 12:20.622
really dark and evil
and powerful?

12:20.624 --> 12:22.724
You definitely are.

12:22.726 --> 12:25.393
My buddy got scratched
on the second floor.

12:25.395 --> 12:27.695
I've felt emotional
here before.

12:27.697 --> 12:29.364
Even right now,
I feel it.

12:29.366 --> 12:31.099
-It's...
-It's because it's around us.

12:31.101 --> 12:33.201
-I know.
-We just brought it down here.

12:33.203 --> 12:36.504
Yep.
I'm serious.

12:36.506 --> 12:38.072
I've never felt
this way here.

12:38.074 --> 12:40.909
I mean, I've felt similar
things, but not this.

12:40.911 --> 12:42.010
-Billy?
-Yeah.

12:42.012 --> 12:44.245
Take him to the classroom
right now.

12:46.349 --> 12:49.250
-We stirred it up a little bit.
-Oh, 100%.

12:49.252 --> 12:51.252
-Super heavy in here.
-Right here.

12:51.254 --> 12:53.621
BILLY: Yep.
It's right there.

12:53.623 --> 12:56.424
Right by that mark.
I'm not touching that thing.

12:56.426 --> 12:57.825
No.
I'll try it.

12:57.827 --> 13:01.062
ZAK: The moment Dallon touches
the satanic mark...

13:01.064 --> 13:02.397
Where's Jay?

13:02.399 --> 13:03.731
...Jay drops to the ground

13:03.733 --> 13:06.401
complaining of a sharp pain
in the side of his head.

13:06.403 --> 13:08.403
The whole side of my head
is just pounding.

13:08.405 --> 13:09.904
I keep getting
that drilling.

13:11.775 --> 13:13.107
Look at how red
his ear is.

13:13.109 --> 13:15.944
I keep hearing that hiss,
whispery sound, too.

13:15.946 --> 13:17.645
It's, like, my ears, man.

13:17.647 --> 13:20.148
ZAK: Incredibly, Dallon,
who is unaware

13:20.150 --> 13:22.150
of what's happening to Jay,

13:22.152 --> 13:26.087
starts experiencing
a similar affliction.

13:26.089 --> 13:28.389
Damn, Jay.
This isn't good, bro.

13:28.391 --> 13:30.558
All of a sudden,
behind Jay's ear,

13:30.560 --> 13:34.028
a dark red spot
begins to appear.

13:34.030 --> 13:35.630
[ Exhales sharply ]

13:35.632 --> 13:37.131
It's, like, hard
to catch my breath.

13:37.133 --> 13:38.600
You know?

13:38.602 --> 13:40.068
Do you see it?

13:40.070 --> 13:42.904
ZAK: Within the red bruise-like
mark, white marks

13:42.906 --> 13:46.174
that appear to look
like symbols begin to emerge.

13:46.176 --> 13:48.676
It looks like
an X and a 1.

13:48.678 --> 13:51.379
I don't know how much longer
I can be in here, man.

13:51.381 --> 13:53.214
BILLY:
I'm right there with you.

13:53.216 --> 13:54.549
Yeah.
That's weird, dude.

13:54.551 --> 13:56.884
I've never seen anything
like this before.

13:56.886 --> 14:01.055
¶¶

14:01.057 --> 14:04.192
It feels like
we're just at war.

14:04.194 --> 14:06.260
-Yeah. I mean, this is it.
-Literally.

14:06.262 --> 14:09.230
Things are happening,

14:09.232 --> 14:11.332
and people are starting

14:11.334 --> 14:13.801
to get really
poorly affected.

14:13.803 --> 14:15.203
AARON: You all right?

14:15.205 --> 14:18.373
I mean, can you be all right
in this situation?

14:18.375 --> 14:28.049
¶¶

14:28.051 --> 14:30.618
ZAK: It's the second day
of our investigation,

14:30.620 --> 14:33.688
and we had some stuff
happen last night

14:33.690 --> 14:36.658
that was very concerning,

14:36.660 --> 14:39.627
and we're going to meet
with Heather

14:39.629 --> 14:42.897
right now because
Jay wasn't the only one

14:42.899 --> 14:45.566
to be marked last night.

14:47.437 --> 14:48.736
-Hi, Heather.
-Hi.

14:48.738 --> 14:50.271
-Good to see you again.
-Thank you, you, too.

14:50.273 --> 14:52.473
Last night was eventful.

14:52.475 --> 14:55.977
Let me just tell you something
and be real serious with you.

14:55.979 --> 14:59.580
Something dark is
affecting your workers.

14:59.582 --> 15:01.649
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay?

15:01.651 --> 15:04.819
We walked in there yesterday
for the first time.

15:04.821 --> 15:08.990
The energy up there was...
Oh, man.

15:08.992 --> 15:10.391
It was strong.

15:10.393 --> 15:11.592
"Carrie."

15:11.594 --> 15:13.961
We went
into this classroom.

15:13.963 --> 15:15.563
Something
catches our eye.

15:15.565 --> 15:19.367
It appears to us as
an upside-down pentagram...

15:19.369 --> 15:20.535
Oh, okay.

15:20.537 --> 15:22.403
-...which is satanic in nature.
-Yep.

15:22.405 --> 15:26.974
We started using the Spirit
Box device on this mark.

15:26.976 --> 15:30.244
I want you to listen to what
these voices told us.

15:30.246 --> 15:31.979
[ Oscillating static ]

15:31.981 --> 15:33.981
-Watch out.
-Watch out!

15:33.983 --> 15:35.316
AARON: Watch out!

15:35.318 --> 15:36.484
-"Watch out."
-Oh, wow.

15:36.486 --> 15:38.352
-Can you hear that?
-Yeah.

15:38.354 --> 15:42.090
Now, right when I put it back
on the mark, it speaks again.

15:42.092 --> 15:43.491
You'll be killed.

15:43.493 --> 15:44.826
"You'll be killed"!

15:44.828 --> 15:45.893
Oh, my goodness.

15:45.895 --> 15:47.261
ZAK: Oh, my God.

15:47.263 --> 15:49.731
-It's so weird.
-Oh.

15:49.733 --> 15:53.134
This is where
it got serious.

15:53.136 --> 15:55.737
[ Oscillating static ]

15:55.739 --> 16:01.542
This speaks over multiple sweeps
in, like, a full sentence,

16:01.544 --> 16:03.277
but what the thing is,

16:03.279 --> 16:07.115
is that we can't
understand what it says.

16:07.117 --> 16:08.983
It's, like,
in a different language.

16:08.985 --> 16:10.451
Like a chant of something.

16:10.453 --> 16:11.452
BILLY: Yes.

16:11.454 --> 16:16.624
[ Oscillating static ]

16:16.626 --> 16:20.461
Once we captured that dark voice
over multiple sweeps,

16:20.463 --> 16:23.831
then things really started
happening to us badly.

16:23.833 --> 16:25.600
Dude. It's brighter
than the other one.

16:25.602 --> 16:28.136
Is it?
Can feel a scab coming over it.

16:28.138 --> 16:31.472
Hissing in my ear,
and I heard, like, a "ssss."

16:31.474 --> 16:34.308
So we go back into
that room with Dallon.

16:34.310 --> 16:36.277
My ears are, like,
they're wanting to pop,

16:36.279 --> 16:38.412
but I don't know.

16:38.414 --> 16:42.450
We come outside, and he's
laying flat on the ground.

16:42.452 --> 16:44.752
Damn, Jay.
This isn't good, bro.

16:44.754 --> 16:49.624
While we are watching this,
these appear to us.

16:49.626 --> 16:53.127
We see an X here,
and then a 1 there.

16:55.231 --> 16:57.365
And this morning...

16:57.367 --> 16:58.699
Uh-huh.

16:58.701 --> 17:01.636
...we get
a text message from Dallon,

17:01.638 --> 17:02.970
and he takes a photo
and says,

17:02.972 --> 17:06.174
"Guys, I have this really
weird mark behind my ear."

17:06.176 --> 17:07.542
Are you serious?

17:07.544 --> 17:12.046
And he did say these were
burning, as well, two marks.

17:12.048 --> 17:14.448
So, two guys...

17:14.450 --> 17:15.683
Mm-hmm.

17:15.685 --> 17:18.753
...being marked
behind their ears.

17:18.755 --> 17:22.790
ZAK: As we examine
these markings,

17:22.792 --> 17:25.660
we see a total of five
separate scratches

17:25.662 --> 17:28.896
across Jay and Dallon.

17:28.898 --> 17:31.666
When combined, we notice
a disturbing parallel

17:31.668 --> 17:33.000
to the five lines

17:33.002 --> 17:37.605
that make up the most unholy
of all satanic symbols,

17:37.607 --> 17:40.875
the upside-down pentagram,

17:40.877 --> 17:42.643
and we wonder, in a building

17:42.645 --> 17:46.714
that is stamped with
man-made satanic markings,

17:46.716 --> 17:49.784
could this demon now
be marking the living

17:49.786 --> 17:53.855
as a new manifestation
of its oppressive energy?

17:53.857 --> 17:56.924
I mean, we obviously have
something going on here.

17:56.926 --> 17:58.960
When we bought this place
10 years ago,

17:58.962 --> 18:00.862
everybody was telling us,
"Oh, it's haunted."

18:00.864 --> 18:02.163
Like, that was a big thing,

18:02.165 --> 18:04.398
but everybody told us
about the Satan worshiping,

18:04.400 --> 18:06.667
and we kind of just
wanted to ignore it

18:06.669 --> 18:08.836
because we didn't want to --
-That sticks. That stays.

18:08.838 --> 18:10.171
Yeah.

18:10.173 --> 18:15.543
I believe they chose this room
to do rituals in,

18:15.545 --> 18:19.113
and I think that, by leaving
this graffiti on the walls,

18:19.115 --> 18:21.549
it allows these doorways
to stay open.

18:21.551 --> 18:25.586
The fact is, is that
there is something here.

18:25.588 --> 18:27.421
-We felt it.
-Mm-hmm.

18:27.423 --> 18:29.657
These guys have been
marked by it.

what is going on here.

to begin our investigation.

abandoned buildings

to be investigating tonight.

This creepy one right here,
this giant rectangle.

We have another one over here,
another one over here.

19:04.339 --> 19:07.106
These three, we've never
even been in yet.

19:07.108 --> 19:10.343
We're not even going to go in
and discover what's in there

19:10.345 --> 19:13.079
until our investigation
momentarily.

19:13.081 --> 19:16.282
The focus is right over here
at Comish Hall.

19:16.284 --> 19:18.918
That is where we had all
these experiences last night.

19:18.920 --> 19:21.588
That's where we were affected,
where Jay was marked,

19:21.590 --> 19:24.157
as well as one
of our interviewees.

19:24.159 --> 19:27.994
Our brains, or our minds,
are already affected,

19:27.996 --> 19:31.297
so this is going to be really,
really interesting.

19:31.299 --> 19:33.299
Just as we are getting
ready to suit up

19:33.301 --> 19:34.801
and begin our investigation,

19:34.803 --> 19:36.803
I become affected again.

19:36.805 --> 19:38.404
I don't feel like myself.

19:38.406 --> 19:41.808
I feel sick, and as I go
lay down in my RV,

19:41.810 --> 19:44.210
Aaron rushes in and tells me
that he can hear me

19:44.212 --> 19:45.812
screaming for him outside.

19:45.814 --> 19:47.347
You've been in here
the whole time, right?

19:47.749 --> 19:49.015
I heard it out there, man.

19:49.017 --> 19:51.117
I'm by the car,
and all I hear is, "Aaron!"

19:51.119 --> 19:52.452
I'm like, "I didn't hear
the door open."

19:52.454 --> 19:55.355
Like, oh, Zak must be in there.
I kid you not,

19:55.357 --> 19:57.824
the door right there
with that haunted house,

19:57.826 --> 19:59.425
slam!

19:59.427 --> 20:02.028
I run over there, thinking Billy
or someone in there,

20:02.030 --> 20:03.296
open it up and no one
is in there.

20:03.298 --> 20:06.332
It's been open all day.
There's no breeze.

20:06.334 --> 20:10.003
Dude, I heard you, Zak, going,
"Aaron!" from the kitchen area,

20:10.005 --> 20:11.604
from the building area,
and I was like,

20:11.606 --> 20:14.173
"Oh, Zak is ready to go,
or are we ready to do this?"

20:14.175 --> 20:15.875
And then all of a sudden, dude,
that door slammed.

20:15.877 --> 20:18.545
I ran over there.
[ Sighs ]

20:18.547 --> 20:20.413

to nerve center

20:20.415 --> 20:23.016
and send Aaron
to investigate the building

20:23.018 --> 20:24.951
where he just heard a door slam

20:24.953 --> 20:28.555
and heard his name

36:33.670 --> 36:36.872
Another symbol.

36:36.874 --> 36:38.940
Nothing yet on the SLS.

36:38.942 --> 36:45.981
¶¶

36:45.983 --> 36:47.549
It's dead silent.

36:47.551 --> 36:49.851
I mean, it's really,
really quiet down here,

36:49.853 --> 36:51.186
and I just got to this area

36:51.188 --> 36:53.722
where there's these tunnels
that I have to duck.

36:53.724 --> 36:58.593
I don't know where they go, but
I got to check it out, so...

36:58.595 --> 37:04.199
¶¶

37:04.201 --> 37:06.001
Is there anybody in here?

37:06.003 --> 37:08.904
I can't do this, dude.

37:08.906 --> 37:11.273
Oh, my God. I'm so scared
right now.

37:11.275 --> 37:13.408
-[ Crash ]
-Whoa.

37:16.972 --> 37:19.806
¶¶

37:19.808 --> 37:23.376
ZAK: As the four of us are
spread out across the campus

37:23.378 --> 37:25.311
of the Albion Normal School,

37:25.313 --> 37:26.946
I'm inside Comish Hall

37:26.948 --> 37:29.916
armed with a full spectrum
still camera to see

37:29.918 --> 37:32.552
if I can capture an image
of the dark spirit

37:32.554 --> 37:35.155
or spirits we've been
communicating with.

37:35.157 --> 37:38.658

37:38.660 --> 37:41.661
[ Camera shutter clicking ]

37:41.663 --> 37:51.304
¶¶

37:51.306 --> 38:00.947
¶¶

38:00.949 --> 38:02.482
¶¶

38:04.419 --> 38:06.753
[ Camera shutter clicking ]

38:11.026 --> 38:13.426
-[ Crash ]
-Whoa.

38:22.804 --> 38:25.772
[ Breathing heavily ]

38:25.774 --> 38:33.980
¶¶

38:33.982 --> 38:36.616
Oh, my God.

38:36.618 --> 38:40.720
I don't care.
I ran from that.

38:40.722 --> 38:43.990
Something causes
an extremely loud

38:43.992 --> 38:46.760
crashing sound somewhere
very close to me

38:46.762 --> 38:51.030
because I can also feel
the vibrations on my feet.

38:51.032 --> 38:52.232
[ Camera shutter clicks ]

38:52.234 --> 38:54.434
-[ Crash ]
-Whoa.

38:54.436 --> 38:56.936
-[ Crash ]
-Whoa.

38:59.141 --> 39:01.407
When we review
our X camera located

39:01.409 --> 39:04.511
in the notorious
satanic-marked classroom,

39:04.513 --> 39:08.548
we discover that the camera
actually shakes at the same time

39:08.550 --> 39:11.017
that this loud
crashing sound occurs,

39:11.019 --> 39:14.420
and we believe it comes from
somewhere behind the camera.

39:14.422 --> 39:17.957
Also, if you watch the bottom
of the screen very closely,

39:17.959 --> 39:21.027
you can see what appears
to be a dark mass.

39:21.029 --> 39:23.429
¶¶

39:23.431 --> 39:27.433
[ Crash ]

39:27.435 --> 39:30.403
Oh, my God.
That was so loud.

39:30.405 --> 39:32.972
Oh.

39:32.974 --> 39:35.809
I can't do this.
I can't do this, dude.

39:35.811 --> 39:39.879
¶¶

39:39.881 --> 39:44.851
[ Oscillating static ]

39:44.853 --> 39:46.719
Come on, man.

39:48.824 --> 39:50.290
Oh, my God.

39:50.292 --> 39:52.091
I just pulled
the Spirit Box out,

39:52.093 --> 39:54.894
and it sounded like it said,
"Come on in, man."

39:54.896 --> 39:56.496
[ Oscillating static ]

39:56.498 --> 39:58.865
Come on, man.

39:58.867 --> 40:00.567
Come on, man.

40:00.569 --> 40:04.571
[ Oscillating static ]

40:11.813 --> 40:13.746
God.

40:15.483 --> 40:17.684
Look.
I'm in.

40:17.686 --> 40:19.018
The Devil.

40:19.020 --> 40:20.520
"The Devil."

40:20.522 --> 40:21.688
Oh, my God.

40:21.690 --> 40:23.523
It straight up just said,
"The Devil."

40:25.827 --> 40:28.328
Look.
I'm in.

40:28.330 --> 40:30.363
The Devil.

40:30.365 --> 40:31.831
The Devil.

40:31.833 --> 40:34.434
"The Devil."
Oh, my God.

40:34.436 --> 40:36.903
It straight up just said,
"The Devil."

40:36.905 --> 40:38.605
Oh, my God.

40:38.607 --> 40:41.941
Oh, my god.
Oh. Oh.

40:41.943 --> 40:43.343
Oh, something just
came up behind me,

40:43.345 --> 40:45.879
and I just put
myself to the wall.

40:45.881 --> 40:48.581
Oh, my God.

40:48.583 --> 40:51.784
I'm so scared right now.

40:51.786 --> 40:54.654
I'm frozen solid in the room
with just, like,

40:54.656 --> 40:57.924
pig heads, a woman hanging here.

40:57.926 --> 41:06.499
¶¶

41:06.501 --> 41:09.535
There was a loud
banging just now...

41:11.673 --> 41:13.873
and I just heard a woman.

41:23.451 --> 41:25.818
Hey, guys.
Just checking up on you.

41:25.820 --> 41:27.553
How you guys doing?

41:27.555 --> 41:29.022
This is Billy.

41:29.024 --> 41:33.059
I'm hearing noises in this
building, like, moaning sounds,

41:33.061 --> 41:35.228
and I'm trying to find out
where they're coming from,

41:35.230 --> 41:37.430
but I don't think
I'm alone in here.

41:37.432 --> 41:42.302
¶¶

41:42.304 --> 41:44.237
ZAK: There is no doubt
something evil

41:44.239 --> 41:47.941
is lurking throughout the halls
of the Albion Normal School,

41:47.943 --> 41:50.143
and until the satanic markings

41:50.145 --> 41:52.745
that have anchored
this entity to Comish Hall

41:52.747 --> 41:54.647
are removed, we are concerned

41:54.649 --> 41:57.984
that its presence may continue
to adversely affect

41:57.986 --> 41:59.419
anyone who enters it.
