Guess who's ready for adventure?

00:35.080 --> 00:35.800
Uh!

00:35.920 --> 00:36.920
This cat!

00:37.080 --> 00:37.879
[door shuts]

00:38.040 --> 00:38.960
-Yay!
-Uh?

00:39.120 --> 00:40.960
How about surfing in Hawaii?

00:41.080 --> 00:43.040
Or soccer in the rainforest?

00:43.199 --> 00:44.440
I was thinking more like

00:44.600 --> 00:46.760
curling up with a mug of hot chocolate.

00:46.919 --> 00:50.720
And the latest comic
with my favorite character: Daikuku!

00:51.000 --> 00:52.120
Dai-who-who?

00:52.239 --> 00:53.720
Daikuku! He's a ninja.

00:53.879 --> 00:56.680
They're like super sneaky,
super quiet, superheroes from Japan.

00:57.279 --> 00:59.800
Reading about an amazing adventure!

00:59.959 --> 01:01.959
What could be more thrilling?

01:02.120 --> 01:03.000
Nothing...

01:03.199 --> 01:04.759
except going on one!

01:04.920 --> 01:06.240
You want excitement?

01:06.399 --> 01:07.160
Look.

01:07.320 --> 01:08.480
Daikuku climbs

01:08.640 --> 01:11.039
a Japanese mountain with tall cliffs,

01:11.200 --> 01:12.240
vine bridges,

01:12.399 --> 01:13.920
and tricky ninja traps!

01:14.200 --> 01:15.679
[Ollie] And then, and then...

01:15.840 --> 01:16.759
[Gasps]

01:16.880 --> 01:18.000
[Ollie] No! It can't be!

01:18.160 --> 01:19.720
Ah!

01:19.880 --> 01:21.800
-I'm OK!
-"To be continued"?

01:21.960 --> 01:23.280
Eek! What'll I do?

01:24.360 --> 01:25.280
Uhh...

01:25.399 --> 01:27.800
Wait till the next comic comes out?

01:27.960 --> 01:29.560
But that's next month!

01:29.720 --> 01:31.000
I can't wait that long.

01:31.160 --> 01:33.119
I gotta know how it ends!

01:33.240 --> 01:34.080
Ollie!

01:34.280 --> 01:35.960
I'm having a brainstorm!

01:36.119 --> 01:39.759
The bestest brainstorm
I ever stormbrained!

01:40.240 --> 01:41.160
Uh oh.

01:41.320 --> 01:42.960
When you have a brainstorm,

01:43.119 --> 01:45.039
I always get dragged off somewhere.

01:45.199 --> 01:48.920
Why don't we go ask
the comic book artist what happens next?

01:49.080 --> 01:51.280
'Cause the artist is Tomo Goto!

01:51.440 --> 01:53.920
And he lives <i>way </i>over in Japan!

01:54.080 --> 01:57.119
-Even better!
-No, I'll just wait...

01:58.199 --> 02:01.119
for a whole entire, long, long...

02:01.280 --> 02:02.880
<i>long </i>month.

02:03.039 --> 02:04.160
[Moon] OK...

02:04.320 --> 02:06.440
But it would be <i>so </i>much faster

02:06.600 --> 02:09.160
to ask Tomo Goto in person.

02:09.320 --> 02:10.680
In Japan.

02:10.840 --> 02:12.480
Right <i>now </i>.

02:13.920 --> 02:14.880
No, it's fine.

02:15.040 --> 02:16.799
I'd rather...

02:16.960 --> 02:17.760
wait.

02:19.160 --> 02:20.000
Ah!

02:20.120 --> 02:20.959
I can't wait!

02:21.079 --> 02:23.000
I have to know how the comic ends <i>now </i>!

02:23.200 --> 02:25.440
Awesome! Let's go!

02:25.600 --> 02:28.000
Fine. But I wanna take my big book

02:28.120 --> 02:29.959
of Daikuku comics with me.

02:30.120 --> 02:31.079
[Stanley] Ugh...

02:33.359 --> 02:35.200
Ninja surprise!

02:35.320 --> 02:36.400
Hm.

02:36.519 --> 02:37.480
Guys?

02:38.040 --> 02:39.160
Guys?

02:46.920 --> 02:48.120
Whee!

02:58.320 --> 03:02.160
<i>We are now arriving in Japan!</i>

03:06.120 --> 03:07.920
How great is it that we got here

03:08.079 --> 03:11.280
right when
the cherry blossom trees are in bloom?

03:11.399 --> 03:13.040
I love you, cherry trees!

03:13.200 --> 03:15.320
Aren't they wonderful?

03:16.079 --> 03:17.440
Ollie?

03:17.600 --> 03:19.840
Hello. Can you help me find
the comic book artist,

03:20.000 --> 03:21.679
-Mr. Tomo Goto?
-Hmm.

03:21.840 --> 03:23.799
Mr. Goto is very shy.

03:23.959 --> 03:26.239
What if he doesn't want to be found?

03:26.359 --> 03:28.040
He won't mind being found by me.

03:28.200 --> 03:30.239
I've read <i>all </i>his ninja comics.

03:30.399 --> 03:31.160
A hundred times!

03:31.640 --> 03:33.160
Really...?

03:33.320 --> 03:35.200
In that case...

03:35.359 --> 03:36.840
Mr. Goto lives here,

03:37.000 --> 03:39.359
on a hard to get to mountain top.

03:39.519 --> 03:41.880
The journey will be <i>long...</i>

03:42.040 --> 03:43.840
and challenging!

03:44.000 --> 03:44.880
Hm.

03:45.480 --> 03:47.320
And did I mention <i>long </i>?

03:47.480 --> 03:48.799
And <i>challenging </i>?

03:48.920 --> 03:50.519
OK...

03:50.640 --> 03:53.359
Only a true ninja comic master

03:53.519 --> 03:55.519
could make it to the top.

03:55.840 --> 03:58.000
So, best of luck! You're going to need it.

03:58.320 --> 03:59.799
What's that supposed to mean?

03:59.959 --> 04:02.160
Ollie! What a gorgeous place

04:02.280 --> 04:03.679
to have an adventure!

04:03.839 --> 04:06.239
-You ready?
-After talking to that toucan,

04:06.399 --> 04:07.679
I sure hope so!

04:07.799 --> 04:10.920
Then let's go find out
how your comic ends!

04:17.399 --> 04:19.079
[huffs and puffs]

04:19.200 --> 04:20.039
[sighs]

04:20.159 --> 04:21.479
Time-out, Moon.

04:21.640 --> 04:23.240
I need a break!

04:26.360 --> 04:27.640
[Moon] Reading comics

04:27.760 --> 04:29.800
won't help you find Tomo Goto.

04:29.960 --> 04:31.680
But lucky for you...

04:31.840 --> 04:33.280
I'm here!

04:33.400 --> 04:34.200
Ha, ugh!

04:37.039 --> 04:38.200
[huffs and puffs]

04:40.400 --> 04:41.680
Woah!

04:41.880 --> 04:43.919
<i>So </i>cool!

04:44.080 --> 04:45.000
What's cool?

04:46.200 --> 04:47.400
Woah!

04:48.880 --> 04:50.039
Oof!

04:50.560 --> 04:53.320
This bridge is just like the one
in my comic!

04:54.880 --> 04:56.240
Gah...

04:56.400 --> 04:58.240
[Ollie] And it's just as high as
the one in my comic!

04:59.880 --> 05:01.880
You know, I've changed my mind.

05:02.039 --> 05:03.919
I don't need to know the end to my comic.

05:04.039 --> 05:07.960
Let's go on an adventure in our nice,
safe living room!

05:08.120 --> 05:08.960
Or closet?

05:09.080 --> 05:10.400
Don't worry, Ollie!

05:10.560 --> 05:12.200
It's totally safe.

05:12.360 --> 05:13.440
Come on with me.

05:14.240 --> 05:15.400
[creaks]

05:16.960 --> 05:17.800
Yie!

05:17.919 --> 05:19.360
I can't look!

05:19.760 --> 05:20.479
[gasps]

05:26.680 --> 05:27.960
Password?

05:29.960 --> 05:32.280
Hey, Ollie! Is he a ninja?

05:32.440 --> 05:34.560
I think he might be a ninja.

05:34.680 --> 05:37.440
He is a ninja! A real, live one!

05:37.599 --> 05:39.080
[Moon] He wants a password.

05:39.240 --> 05:41.359
Do you know the ninja password?

05:41.520 --> 05:44.120
There's something familiar about all this,
Moon...

05:44.280 --> 05:45.800
Let me think...

05:46.400 --> 05:48.320
Never mind. I've got it.

05:48.479 --> 05:49.479
Let's see...

05:49.599 --> 05:52.039
Is it basketball? Shoelace?

05:52.159 --> 05:53.840
Coconut? Whopperdoodle?

05:53.960 --> 05:55.280
Nope.

05:55.440 --> 05:56.479
And...

05:56.640 --> 05:58.359
nope!

05:58.520 --> 06:00.159
Have you been eating fish?

06:00.320 --> 06:01.840
Yup.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.760
-Thought so!
-Wait, wait!

06:03.880 --> 06:04.880
I think I have it!

06:05.000 --> 06:06.320
It was in comic number four

06:06.479 --> 06:08.159
when Daikuku bows to the ninja,

06:08.320 --> 06:09.800
and says the famous password:

06:09.960 --> 06:13.000
Konichiwa!
That's a friendly Japanese greeting.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.479
It is? Let's try it.

06:15.640 --> 06:16.479
-Konichiwa.
-Konichiwa...

06:16.599 --> 06:17.440
[screams]

06:17.599 --> 06:19.680
I got you, Ollie!

06:19.840 --> 06:21.599
But, where did the ninja go?

06:21.719 --> 06:22.719
Disappeared.

06:22.880 --> 06:24.120
Just like that!

06:24.240 --> 06:27.080
Pretty cool. But I know something cooler.

06:27.240 --> 06:29.919
Finding out how  your comic ends!

06:36.440 --> 06:39.400
Hm. It looks like we have to go
through the forest,

06:39.560 --> 06:40.840
then up that mountain.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.440
Got it! Nothing can stop us now.

06:43.599 --> 06:44.760
You think so?

06:44.919 --> 06:46.159
I don't know.

06:46.280 --> 06:48.960
Those leaves are rustling
like there's a ninja in there.

06:49.120 --> 06:53.320
Plus, there's something about this path
that looks familiar.

06:53.479 --> 06:55.560
Ollie! We'll never find Tomo Goto

06:55.719 --> 06:57.200
if we don't stop...

06:57.320 --> 06:58.840
[she screams]

06:59.599 --> 07:00.719
So.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.520
Does this look familiar too?

07:02.680 --> 07:03.560
Sure does!

07:03.680 --> 07:07.159
This ninja trap is just like the one
in comic number seven!

07:07.280 --> 07:08.400
Amazing...

07:08.560 --> 07:10.560
So how does Daikuku escape?

07:10.719 --> 07:11.799
Simple!

07:12.400 --> 07:13.200
Like this!

07:13.359 --> 07:14.520
[Moon] Oh.

07:18.120 --> 07:19.039
That was fun!

07:19.159 --> 07:21.880
You sure do know your ninja comics, Ollie.

07:22.080 --> 07:23.880
What do you think is next?

07:31.479 --> 07:34.479
Well, we've already run into
two tricky ninja tests...

07:35.640 --> 07:38.080
so there will probably be another.

07:38.840 --> 07:40.400
A ninja-robot maybe.

07:40.560 --> 07:42.440
-A ninja alien?
-Ugh!

07:43.039 --> 07:44.440
Ollie...

07:44.599 --> 07:47.479
I think I know what's next...

07:47.640 --> 07:48.640
Him!

07:48.799 --> 07:49.640
Ah!

07:50.520 --> 07:51.400
You know what?

07:51.560 --> 07:53.680
For once I agree with your first plan...

07:53.840 --> 07:54.760
Let's go home!

07:54.919 --> 07:56.719
But Moon! We can't stop now.

07:56.880 --> 07:59.359
I'm too close to finding out
how my comic ends!

08:00.000 --> 08:00.919
[growls]

08:01.120 --> 08:01.840
Besides,

08:02.000 --> 08:03.840
I'm a ninja comic master.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.840
And I remember this monster
from comic number ten.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.719
That's the one where the giant lizard
scares the villagers.

08:10.400 --> 08:13.560
But the monster
turns out to be nothing more than...

08:13.719 --> 08:14.719
[growls]

08:16.640 --> 08:18.960
a ninja in a monster suit!

08:19.239 --> 08:20.280
Wahoo!

08:20.760 --> 08:24.400
You have passed my tricky ninja traps.

08:24.560 --> 08:28.120
You are now free to climb the mountain.

08:28.960 --> 08:30.120
[Ollie] Woah.

08:30.719 --> 08:31.840
Yay, Ollie!

08:32.000 --> 08:34.439
You really <i>are </i>a ninja comic master!

08:34.559 --> 08:35.319
Yup!

08:35.439 --> 08:38.959
And now it's time to finally ask
Tomo Goto how the comic ends.

09:11.520 --> 09:12.480
I can't believe it!

09:12.640 --> 09:14.000
We came all this way,

09:14.160 --> 09:16.920
and passed all the tricky ninja traps
for nothing?

09:17.079 --> 09:18.959
Aw. Cheer up, Ollie.

09:19.120 --> 09:21.319
We still had a wonderful adventure.

09:21.480 --> 09:23.439
And maybe we can come back tomorrow.

09:23.600 --> 09:24.839

Congratulations!

You two brave adventure cats

09:32.400 --> 09:33.959
came all the way to Japan,

09:34.120 --> 09:36.319
and made it all the way up the mountain.

09:36.720 --> 09:39.280
And you shall be rewarded...

09:39.959 --> 09:41.079
Ninja dive!

09:43.000 --> 09:45.280
What a save!

09:45.439 --> 09:46.319
Go, Ollie!

09:46.480 --> 09:47.880
Are you all right, Mr. Ninja?

09:48.040 --> 09:49.400
I'm fine.

09:49.560 --> 09:52.319
But let me take off my mask,
so I can meet you!

09:53.280 --> 09:56.480
I am the comic book artist, Tomo Goto.

Meet to pleased you!

09:57.720 --> 09:59.640
I mean, pleased to meet you!

09:59.760 --> 10:00.720
[he laughs]

10:03.720 --> 10:05.160
I've almost finished

10:05.280 --> 10:08.319
the next comic,
but I just didn't know how to end it.

10:08.760 --> 10:09.800
Ho! But you two

10:09.920 --> 10:11.199
have inspired me!

10:11.360 --> 10:15.000
Ho, ho, now I know exactly
how to end my comic.

10:15.160 --> 10:17.400
With two cat co-stars

10:17.560 --> 10:19.560
for double the thrills. <i>And...</i>

10:19.680 --> 10:22.199
a heroic mud puddle rescue! Ho, ho, ha!

10:22.400 --> 10:24.000
Hmm.

10:24.120 --> 10:25.079
You know, Moon.

10:25.240 --> 10:26.800
Getting past the traps was hard,

10:26.959 --> 10:30.280
but the most important step
was getting out the front door.

10:30.720 --> 10:31.560
Thanks, Moon.

10:31.680 --> 10:34.720
I'll go on an adventure with you anytime,
Ninja Ollie.

10:34.880 --> 10:36.160
[slurps]

10:36.319 --> 10:37.280
Ah.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.280
You were totally right, Moon!

10:41.400 --> 10:45.880
Sometimes being on a real adventure
can be as much fun as reading one!

10:46.000 --> 10:47.520
But being drawn into a new comic?

10:48.040 --> 10:51.680
Well, that's just
slipper-wearing, cocoa-sipping amazing!

10:51.839 --> 10:52.640
Ninja surprise!

10:52.800 --> 10:54.760
Waa-yaa!

10:54.920 --> 10:56.439
[giggling]

10:56.600 --> 10:57.360
-Hi-ya!
-Whoa!

10:57.520 --> 10:58.760
[giggling]
