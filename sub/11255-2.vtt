WEBVTT

01:07.025 --> 01:09.194
{\an3}WHY ARE YOU SO
RESISTANT TO CHANGE?

01:09.277 --> 01:10.862
KEEP AN OPEN MIND.

01:10.945 --> 01:12.322
{\an1}I LIKE MY FURNITURE
THE WAY IT IS.

01:12.405 --> 01:13.990
{\an1}I DON'T WANT IT
RE-ARRANGED.

01:14.073 --> 01:16.993
BUT MY WAY YOU CAN
HAVE YOUR BEER

01:17.076 --> 01:19.329
{\an3}SIT ON THE SOFA,
WATCH TV

01:19.412 --> 01:22.665
AND STILL HAVE A CLEAN,
15-FOOT HOOK SHOT

01:22.749 --> 01:24.501
TO THE WASTE BASKET.

01:24.584 --> 01:28.129
{\an1}DID YOU EVER CONSIDER WALKING
OVER TO THE WASTE BASKET?

01:28.213 --> 01:31.049
IF YOU WON'T TAKE
THIS DISCUSSION SERIOUSLY

01:31.132 --> 01:32.175
FORGET IT.

01:32.258 --> 01:34.677
{\an3}EVER SINCE YOU CAME BACK
TO NANTUCKET

01:34.761 --> 01:36.846
YOU'VE BEEN TRYING
TO CHANGE ME.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.681
I HAVE A NICE
ORDERLY EXISTENCE.

01:38.765 --> 01:41.142
I'M JUST TRYING
TO LOOSEN YOU UP.

01:41.226 --> 01:42.644
YOU NEED TO BE
MORE SPONTANEOUS.

01:42.727 --> 01:44.312
I LIKE SPONTANEITY.

01:44.395 --> 01:46.147
I JUST NEED WARNING

01:46.231 --> 01:49.067
SO IT DOESN'T COME
OUT OF NOWHERE.

01:51.903 --> 01:53.154
HELEN, WAIT A SECOND.

01:53.238 --> 01:56.157
{\an1}HOW DID YOU LIKE
MY IN-FLIGHT SNACK?

01:56.241 --> 01:57.826
ROY, WHAT WAS THAT?

01:57.909 --> 01:59.160
TOFU.

01:59.244 --> 02:02.288
{\an1}IT CAN BE ANYTHING
YOU WANT.

02:02.372 --> 02:04.541
I WANT IT KEPT AWAY FROM ME.

02:04.624 --> 02:06.251
HOW DID YOUR AUDITION GO?

02:06.334 --> 02:08.877
LIKE ANY OTHER
SYMPHONY AUDITION--

02:08.961 --> 02:10.588
I WENT, I PLAYED, THEY YAWNED.

02:10.672 --> 02:14.133
NOW I WAIT FOR A PHONE CALL
THAT WILL NEVER COME.

02:14.217 --> 02:15.552
ON THE POSITIVE SIDE

02:15.635 --> 02:19.097
{\an3}YOU HAVE SOME TOFU
IN THE CORNER OF YOUR MOUTH.

02:19.180 --> 02:22.392
THAT'S WHY THE GUY
ON THE PLANE KEPT GOING...

02:22.475 --> 02:24.352
I THOUGHT HE WAS FLIRTING.

02:25.478 --> 02:26.729
HE'S STILL HERE.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.064
Brian:
WHO? WHAT?

02:28.147 --> 02:30.108
THAT OLD GUY
OVER THERE.

02:30.191 --> 02:31.860
HE WAS HERE
YESTERDAY.

02:31.943 --> 02:33.945
I GOT NEWS FOR YOU.

02:34.028 --> 02:36.155
HE'S BEEN HERE
FOR THREE DAYS.

02:36.239 --> 02:39.033
{\an3}PROBABLY WAITING
FOR ONE OF YOUR FLIGHTS.

02:39.117 --> 02:42.161
I'VE BEEN KEEPING AN EYE ON HIM.

02:42.245 --> 02:44.664
HE JUST SITS THERE
MORNING TO NIGHT

02:44.747 --> 02:47.500
READING HIS PAPER,
MINDING HIS OWN BUSINESS.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.460
I DON'T TRUST HIM.

02:49.544 --> 02:51.796
{\an1}QUICK, HELEN,
CALL THE SWAT TEAM.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.465
{\an1}THERE'S A GUY LOOSE
MINDING HIS OWN BUSINESS.

02:54.549 --> 02:56.134
YOU OUGHT
TO INTRODUCE YOURSELF.

02:56.217 --> 02:57.343
MAYBE HE GIVES LESSONS.

02:57.427 --> 03:01.264
{\an5}Fay:
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
THAT GENTLEMAN OVER THERE?

03:01.347 --> 03:02.765
I'VE NOTICED HIM.

03:02.849 --> 03:04.601
HE'S GOT SWEET EARS.

03:04.684 --> 03:05.810
WHAT?

03:05.894 --> 03:07.937
WHEN A MAN GETS OLDER

03:08.021 --> 03:10.231
AND DOESN'T HAVE HAIR
GROWING FROM HIS EARS

03:10.315 --> 03:12.191
IT'S A SIGN
OF GOOD CHARACTER.

03:12.275 --> 03:13.902
HOWARD.

03:13.985 --> 03:15.737
LOWELL.

03:15.820 --> 03:17.614
Roy:
LOWELL.

03:17.697 --> 03:18.907
GET OVER HERE.

03:18.990 --> 03:20.241
LOWELL, COME HERE.

03:20.325 --> 03:21.743
WHO IS
THAT GUY?

03:21.826 --> 03:23.077
HOWARD BANKS.

03:23.161 --> 03:25.580
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT HIM?

03:25.663 --> 03:26.915
NOT MUCH.

03:26.998 --> 03:28.917
HE'S A RETIRED
HAT SALESMAN.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.127
HE'S FLYING SOLO
AROUND THE WORLD

03:31.210 --> 03:33.796
{\an3}IN THAT STEARMAN
TWO-SEATER OUT THERE

03:33.880 --> 03:37.133
AND HE'S A ARIES
WITH HIS MOON IN SCORPIO.

03:37.216 --> 03:39.844
{\an3}SORRY I COULDN'T
BE MORE HELP.

03:39.928 --> 03:43.139
{\an1}SPEAKING OF STRANGERS
LURKING AROUND THE AIRPORT.

03:43.222 --> 03:46.142
WHAT DO WE REALLY
KNOW ABOUT LOWELL?

03:46.225 --> 03:48.478
SAY, JUST OUT
OF CURIOSITY.

03:48.561 --> 03:52.148
{\an1}IS THAT THE DRESS
YOU WORE TO YOUR AUDITION?

03:52.231 --> 03:54.150
YEAH. WHY?

03:54.233 --> 03:55.652
NOTHING, NOTHING.

03:55.735 --> 03:56.986
IT'S VERY NICE.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.155
(<i> snoring</i> )

03:59.238 --> 04:00.657
LET ME GUESS--

04:00.740 --> 04:03.576
{\an3}YOU'RE HINTING
THAT MY DRESS IS BORING.

04:03.660 --> 04:04.827
NOT BORING, NO.

04:04.911 --> 04:06.537
IT'S COMA-INDUCING.

04:06.621 --> 04:09.999
{\an1}IT'S A MEMBER
OF THE BARBITURATE FAMILY.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.793
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

04:11.876 --> 04:14.545
{\an1}THE CONDUCTOR'S A MAN?
YOU'RE A WOMAN?

04:14.629 --> 04:15.880
THAT'S THE RUMOR.

04:15.964 --> 04:17.882
DON'T YOU THINK THE CONDUCTOR

04:17.966 --> 04:21.886
{\an1}WOULD WANT TO SEE A LITTLE LEG
IN THE CELLO SECTION?

04:21.970 --> 04:23.680
BUY A NEW DRESS.

04:23.763 --> 04:24.889
GIVE THE MAESTRO

04:24.973 --> 04:28.893
{\an1}A REASON TO KEEP
THE OLD BATON IN THE AIR.

04:28.977 --> 04:32.146
LEAVE IT TO YOU TO TURN
A SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA

04:32.230 --> 04:34.065
{\an3}INTO A WET
T-SHIRT CONTEST.

04:34.148 --> 04:36.484
TALENT IS
ALL THAT MATTERS.

04:36.567 --> 04:37.819
YEAH RIGHT, TALENT.

04:37.902 --> 04:40.154
{\an1}NOBODY SINGS BETTER
THAN MADONNA?

04:40.238 --> 04:43.157
{\an1}NOBODY READS THE NEWS
BETTER THAN MARIA SHRIVER?

04:43.241 --> 04:44.826
{\an1}GET WITH IT--
SEX SELLS.

04:44.909 --> 04:48.830
I HAVE TOO MUCH RESPECT
FOR MYSELF AND MY TALENT

04:48.913 --> 04:50.707
TO BEHAVE LIKE SOME BIMBO.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.750
FORGET IT,
END OF DISCUSSION.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.836
HELEN, WHILE
YOU WERE GONE

04:54.919 --> 04:57.505
YOU GOT A MESSAGE
FROM THE SYMPHONY

04:57.588 --> 04:59.507
AND I TOOK A DONUT.

04:59.590 --> 05:00.717
WHAT WAS IT?

05:00.800 --> 05:02.802
LEMON-FILLED.

05:02.885 --> 05:04.554
WHAT WAS THE MESSAGE?

05:04.637 --> 05:06.889
THEY WANT YOU
TO COME BACK

05:06.973 --> 05:08.224
FOR THE FINAL
AUDITIONS.

05:08.307 --> 05:09.517
I GOT A CALL-BACK!

05:09.600 --> 05:11.394
<i>I</i> GOT A CALL-BACK!

05:11.477 --> 05:12.562
I'M SO EXCITED.

05:12.645 --> 05:13.896
I BETTER GO PRACTICE.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.898
{\an1}IF YOU'RE WEARING
THAT DRESS

05:15.982 --> 05:17.900
{\an1}YOU BETTER
PRACTICE A LOT.

05:17.984 --> 05:22.238
I HAVE FAITH IN MY TALENT
EVEN IF YOU DON'T.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.073
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

05:24.157 --> 05:25.616
STRAPLESS?
SLIT UP THE SIDES?

05:25.700 --> 05:28.286
{\an1}SPOKEN LIKE
A TRUE MUSICIAN.

05:28.369 --> 05:29.787
UH, EXCUSE ME.

05:29.871 --> 05:33.291
{\an1}I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE
FLYING AROUND THE WORLD.

05:33.374 --> 05:34.625
THAT'S RIGHT.

05:34.709 --> 05:38.087
{\an1}THAT'S QUITE AN UNDERTAKING
FOR A MAN YOUR AGE.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.465
{\an1}NOT THAT YOU'RE
ANY PARTICULAR AGE.

05:40.548 --> 05:44.844
{\an1}AND YOU LOOK 20 YEARS YOUNGER
THAN WHATEVER AGE YOU ARE.

05:44.927 --> 05:46.137
THANK YOU, I THINK.

05:46.220 --> 05:48.222
I'M FAY EVELYN COCHRAN.

05:48.306 --> 05:49.807
HOWARD BANKS.

05:49.891 --> 05:51.309
{\an1}I'VE NOTICED
YOU SITTING HERE.

05:51.392 --> 05:54.062
YES, I'VE KEPT
AN EYE ON YOU, TOO.

05:54.145 --> 05:55.605
YES, I'VE NOTICE THAT.

05:55.688 --> 05:57.774
I NOTICED
THAT YOU NOTICED.

05:57.857 --> 05:59.442
THIS IS GETTING SILLY.

05:59.525 --> 06:01.611
I NOTICED THAT, TOO.

06:01.694 --> 06:05.239
I'D LOVE TO HEAR
ABOUT YOUR TRIP.

06:05.323 --> 06:07.241
WELL, TWO YEARS AGO

06:07.325 --> 06:10.745
I LEFT MY HAT SHOP
IN NEW BEDFORD

06:10.828 --> 06:12.622
AND STARTED FLYING
AROUND THE WORLD.

06:12.705 --> 06:13.748
NEW BEDFORD?

06:13.831 --> 06:15.917
YOU MEAN YOU'RE
ONLY 40 MINUTES

06:16.000 --> 06:17.251
{\an1}FROM COMPLETING
YOUR JOURNEY?

06:17.335 --> 06:18.127
THAT'S RIGHT.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.962
{\an1}WHY ARE YOU
SITTING HERE?

06:20.046 --> 06:21.422
I'M IN NO HURRY.

06:21.506 --> 06:24.258
I'VE GOT NOBODY WAITING
FOR ME AT HOME

06:24.342 --> 06:26.594
AND I'M ENJOYING
THE LOCAL SCENERY.

06:26.677 --> 06:29.263
OH, YOU FLY-BOYS.

06:29.347 --> 06:33.601
{\an3}I IMAGINE YOUR HUSBAND
ENJOYS THE SCENERY, TOO?

06:33.684 --> 06:36.562
{\an1}HE WOULD,
EXCEPT HE'S PART OF IT.

06:37.897 --> 06:39.941
HE DIED SEVERAL YEARS AGO.

06:40.024 --> 06:41.484
OH, I'M SORRY.

06:41.567 --> 06:44.821
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE
NOT ANXIOUS TO TAKE OFF

06:44.904 --> 06:46.322
AND FINISH YOUR TRIP.

06:46.405 --> 06:47.824
BELIEVE ME, I'M NOT.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.158
{\an1}WHY?

06:49.242 --> 06:52.495
WELL, WHEN I SET
BACK DOWN AGAIN

06:52.578 --> 06:55.164
IN NEW BEDFORD,
I'M GOING TO DIE.

06:55.248 --> 07:00.128
NOW...
EXCUSE ME FOR A MOMENT.

07:00.211 --> 07:03.422
I SURE KNOW HOW TO PICK THEM.

07:09.470 --> 07:11.222
{\an1}HELEN, FINAL
BOARDING CALL.

07:11.305 --> 07:12.682
{\an1}LET'S GO.

07:12.765 --> 07:14.642
JUST A FEW MORE MINUTES, PLEASE.

07:14.725 --> 07:16.936
{\an1}I HATE TO BURST
YOUR BUBBLE

07:17.019 --> 07:20.189
{\an1}BUT I TOLD THE PASSENGERS
WHY WE WERE WAITING

07:20.273 --> 07:22.316
{\an1}AND THEY SAID,
"DUMP THE BROAD."

07:22.400 --> 07:25.486
{\an1}THE SHOP JUST FINISHED
THE ALTERATIONS ON MY DRESS.

07:25.570 --> 07:28.197
IT SHOULD BE HERE
ANY MINUTE NOW.

07:28.281 --> 07:31.492
{\an1}I'LL STALL THE PASSENGERS
WITH SOME SHOW TUNES.

07:31.576 --> 07:34.162
MAYBE SOMETHING
FROM <i> A CHORUS LINE.</i>

07:34.245 --> 07:37.165
THE ACOUSTICS
ON THE PLANE ARE GREAT.

07:37.248 --> 07:40.835
I JUST WISH THE AISLES
WERE A LITTLE WIDER.

07:40.918 --> 07:44.505
THIS IS GETTING WEIRDER
BY THE MINUTE.

07:44.589 --> 07:46.132
WHAT'S WRONG, ROY?

07:46.215 --> 07:49.218
THAT OLD KOOK THAT'S
FLYING AROUND THE WORLD

07:49.302 --> 07:52.597
{\an3}IS IN THE MEN'S ROOM
BUCK NAKED

07:52.680 --> 07:53.890
BATHING IN THE SINK.

07:53.973 --> 07:57.226
{\an3}HE'S THE WHITEST MAN
I'VE EVER SEEN.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.604
IT'S NOT GOING WELL AT ALL.

07:59.687 --> 08:02.899
{\an1}I STARTED SINGING "EVERYTHING
IS BEAUTIFUL AT THE BALLET"

08:02.982 --> 08:05.484
{\an1}AND SOME WOMAN WHACKED ME
WITH HER FLOATATION DEVICE.

08:05.568 --> 08:07.737
BRIAN, YOU SHOULD HAVE TAKEN OFF
SEVEN MINUTES AGO.

08:07.820 --> 08:10.198
{\an3}EIGHT--
YOU'RE SLIPPING.

08:10.281 --> 08:11.574
IT'S MY FAULT.

08:11.657 --> 08:13.576
I NEED A COUPLE
MORE MINUTES.

08:13.659 --> 08:15.953
I'M NOT QUITE READY
TO GO YET.

08:16.037 --> 08:17.246
OH, I UNDERSTAND.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.248
YOU'RE NERVOUS
ABOUT YOUR CALL-BACK.

08:19.332 --> 08:20.583
RIGHT, RIGHT.

08:20.666 --> 08:21.959
IT'S YOUR FIRST ONE.

08:22.043 --> 08:23.711
WELL, THAT'S TRUE.

08:23.794 --> 08:25.713
{\an1}YOU'VE NEVER GOTTEN
THIS FAR BEFORE.

08:25.796 --> 08:26.923
UH-HUH.

08:27.006 --> 08:30.426
{\an1}YOU'VE FAILED EVERY
AUDITION YOU'VE GONE TO.

08:30.509 --> 08:32.761
NOW YOU'VE REACHED
THAT NEXT PLATEAU

08:32.845 --> 08:35.306
{\an1}AND THE PRESSURE
IS MORE PARALYZING.

08:35.389 --> 08:38.058
I GUESS YOU'VE NEVER WORKED
A SUICIDE HOTLINE.

08:38.142 --> 08:39.227
HUH?

08:39.309 --> 08:40.269
NEVER MIND.

08:40.352 --> 08:43.231
LET'S GET THIS FLIGHT
IN THE AIR.

08:43.313 --> 08:44.941
WE CAN'T, JOE.

08:45.024 --> 08:46.108
WHY?

08:46.192 --> 08:47.568
I DON'T THINK

08:47.652 --> 08:50.238
{\an1}I'M EMOTIONALLY READY
TO TAKE OFF.

08:50.321 --> 08:54.992
ARE YOU EMOTIONALLY
READY TO JOB HUNT?

08:55.076 --> 08:56.244
I'LL TELL HIM.

08:56.327 --> 08:58.579
I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE.

08:58.663 --> 09:00.581
I'M WAITING FOR MY DRESS

09:00.665 --> 09:03.084
TO GET BACK
FROM THE DRESSMAKER'S.

09:03.167 --> 09:05.294
A DRESS IS HOLDING UP
MY FLIGHT?

09:05.378 --> 09:08.631
{\an1}YOU'LL WONDER WHAT'S
HOLDING UP THAT DRESS.

09:08.714 --> 09:09.840
YOU HAVE AN AUDITION DRESS.

09:09.924 --> 09:12.134
BRIAN THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE BETTER

09:12.218 --> 09:14.303
TO WEAR SOMETHING
A LITTLE SEXIER.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.805
OH, "BRIAN THOUGHT."

09:15.888 --> 09:17.974
I KNOW THAT
YOU'RE THINKING

09:18.057 --> 09:19.976
IT'S A SLEAZY,
DEMEANING TRICK

09:20.059 --> 09:21.978
AND THAT I'VE
LOWER MYSELF

09:22.061 --> 09:23.479
TO BRIAN'S LEVEL.

09:23.562 --> 09:25.648
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

09:25.731 --> 09:27.817
I'M NOT SAYING A WORD.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.819
IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT

09:29.902 --> 09:32.530
{\an1}YOU'LL NEVER KNOW
WHETHER YOU WON BECAUSE

09:32.613 --> 09:35.533
{\an1}OF YOUR CELLO PLAYING
OR SOME SEXY DRESS.

09:35.616 --> 09:38.536
HE'S CLOUDING THE ISSUE
WITH MORALITY.

09:38.619 --> 09:40.705
IT'S YOUR DECISION, HELEN.

09:40.788 --> 09:44.875
{\an1}THE ONLY OTHER SHOW I KNOW
IS <i> PHANTOM OF THE OPERA.</i>

09:44.959 --> 09:47.503
I DON'T WANT THOSE PEOPLE

09:47.586 --> 09:48.838
TO DEFACE ME.

09:48.921 --> 09:50.214
YOU'RE RIGHT, JOE.

09:50.298 --> 09:52.216
I DON'T NEED THAT DRESS.

09:52.300 --> 09:55.219
I CAN DO IT
ON MY TALENT ALONE.

09:55.303 --> 09:57.221
IT'S JUST THAT
UNTIL RECENTLY

09:57.305 --> 09:59.724
I'VE BEEN SO OVERWEIGHT

09:59.807 --> 10:03.561
AND DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION
TO BE SLEAZY AND DEMEANING.

10:03.644 --> 10:05.521
I JUST WANT THIS JOB.

10:05.604 --> 10:07.189
YOU'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING.

10:07.273 --> 10:09.650
{\an1}BRIAN, GET THE DAMN PLANE
OFF THE GROUND.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.527
YES, CAPTAIN, MY CAPTAIN.

10:11.610 --> 10:12.862
LET'S GO.

10:12.945 --> 10:13.988
MISS CHAPPEL!

10:14.071 --> 10:15.197
HERE'S YOUR DRESS.

10:15.281 --> 10:17.575
SORRY IT TOOK SO LONG.

10:18.909 --> 10:20.536
OH, WHAT THE HELL.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.456
I'VE HAD TALENT ALL MY LIFE.

10:23.539 --> 10:25.750
I JUST GOT THIS BODY.

10:32.089 --> 10:32.882
<i>ANNOUNCING THE ARRIVAL</i>

10:32.965 --> 10:35.009
{\an1}OF SANDPIPER AIR
FLIGHT 18

10:35.092 --> 10:37.386
{\an1}FROM BOSTON,
"THE CRADLE OF LIBERTY."

10:37.470 --> 10:39.221
NO, THAT'S PHILADELPHIA.

10:39.305 --> 10:43.059
"THE CITY WITH BIG SHOULDERS."

10:43.142 --> 10:45.311
{\an1}NO, THAT'S
CHICAGO.

10:45.394 --> 10:47.396
"GATEWAY TO THE WEST."

10:47.480 --> 10:49.065
NO, NO...

10:49.148 --> 10:51.525
WELL, I KNOW BOSTON'S SOMETHING.

10:51.609 --> 10:52.401
HELEN'S FLIGHT IS COMING IN.

10:52.485 --> 10:53.903
I HOPE SHE DID WELL.

10:53.986 --> 10:57.406
I CAN TELL HOW HELEN DID
THE SECOND SHE WALKS IN.

10:57.490 --> 11:00.201
{\an1}SHE CAN KEEP
A PRETTY STRAIGHT FACE.

11:00.284 --> 11:02.536
I'VE BEEN STUDYING KARAMANDU

11:02.620 --> 11:05.247
THE ANCIENT INDIAN ART
OF FACE-READING.

11:05.331 --> 11:08.376
THERE ARE MINUTE MOVEMENTS
OF FACIAL MUSCLES

11:08.459 --> 11:10.044
THAT MEAN NOTHING TO YOU

11:10.127 --> 11:12.046
BUT THAT SPEAK VOLUMES
TO ME.

11:12.129 --> 11:13.714
FOR INSTANCE I CAN TELL

11:13.798 --> 11:16.592
BY THE SLIGHT WRINKLING
OF YOUR FOREHEAD

11:16.675 --> 11:18.302
THAT YOU ARE SKEPTICAL.

11:18.386 --> 11:19.970
WELL, I'M CONVINCED.

11:20.054 --> 11:21.972
(<i> whistling</i> )

11:22.056 --> 11:25.309
{\an1}HOOTCHY-KOOTCHY,
KOOTCHY, KOOTCHY, KOOTCHY!

11:25.393 --> 11:26.560
YA-HOO!

11:26.644 --> 11:29.313
HERE'S A CHALLENGE--
WHAT'S YOUR READING?

11:29.397 --> 11:31.941
EITHER SHE DID WELL
AT HER AUDITION

11:32.024 --> 11:34.568
{\an3}OR SHE'S DRUNK
AS A BILLY GOAT.

11:34.652 --> 11:37.738
SO IT LOOKS LIKE
EVERYTHING WENT OKAY.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.949
{\an1}OKAY?
SHE WAS WAILING, MAN.

11:40.032 --> 11:42.076
I WAS INCREDIBLE, JOE.

11:42.159 --> 11:44.286
I WAS SOLID
ON MY HAYDN D-MAJOR.

11:44.370 --> 11:47.164
{\an1}I SHOWED FLASHES OF BRILLIANCE
ON MY DVORAK

11:47.248 --> 11:50.584
AND THEN I KICKED
SOME SERIOUS BUTT ON MY BRAHMS.

11:50.668 --> 11:52.294
LITTLE MAMA WAS GRINDING.

11:52.378 --> 11:55.548
{\an3}WHO ARE YOU--
BLIND LEMON HACKETT?

11:55.631 --> 11:56.841
I'VE GOT IT--

11:56.924 --> 11:58.592
"CITY OF LIGHT."

11:58.676 --> 12:01.095
NO, THAT'S NOT RIGHT.
SORRY.

12:01.178 --> 12:02.847
NOT TO BE OVER-CONFIDENT

12:02.930 --> 12:05.307
BUT I THINK THIS THING
IS SEWN UP.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.143
{\an3}DOESN'T IT FEEL GOOD
TO KNOW

12:07.226 --> 12:08.978
{\an3}YOU GOT THIS FAR
ON TALENT

12:09.061 --> 12:11.313
WITHOUT RESORTING
TO CHEAP TACTICS?

12:11.397 --> 12:12.690
YES, OF COURSE.

12:12.773 --> 12:14.275
YOU CAN BE CONFIDENT NOW

12:14.358 --> 12:16.318
THAT IT WASN'T SOME SEXY DRESS.

12:16.402 --> 12:18.320
IT WAS YOUR MUSICAL ABILITY.

12:18.404 --> 12:19.655
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

12:19.738 --> 12:22.324
{\an1}NOBODY CAN MAKE
SNICKERING INNUENDOES

12:22.408 --> 12:24.493
ABOUT HOW YOU GOT THE JOB...

12:24.577 --> 12:26.203
ALL RIGHT,
I WORE THE DRESS.

12:26.287 --> 12:27.329
ARE YOU SATISFIED?

12:27.413 --> 12:31.041
GEEZ, YOU'RE A PIT BULL--
DIG, DIG, DIG, DIG, DIG.

12:31.125 --> 12:33.169
HELEN, YOU GOT A CALL.

12:33.252 --> 12:35.045
OH, FAY...

12:35.129 --> 12:38.340
BOSTON IS KNOWN AS "BEAN TOWN."

12:38.424 --> 12:39.675
"BEAN TOWN?"

12:39.758 --> 12:41.218
PLEASE, JOE

12:41.302 --> 12:44.054
{\an1}I DIDN'T JUST FALL OFF
THE TURNIP TRUCK.

12:44.138 --> 12:45.514
"BEAN TOWN."

12:45.598 --> 12:47.641
THE CONDUCTOR
CALLED ME HIMSELF.

12:47.725 --> 12:49.560
HE WANTS ME
TO CALL HIM BACK.

12:49.643 --> 12:51.228
THAT'S NICE.

12:51.312 --> 12:53.022
"THAT'S NICE,"
HE SAYS.

12:53.105 --> 12:56.817
YOU MAY KNOW AIRLINES,
BUT YOU KNOW <i> BUBKIS</i> ABOUT MUSIC.

12:56.901 --> 12:58.360
DON'T YOU SEE?

12:58.444 --> 13:01.197
THE CONDUCTOR
CALLED ME PERSONALLY.

13:01.280 --> 13:05.117
{\an3}IT MEANS
I MUST HAVE THE JOB.

13:05.201 --> 13:07.828
HELLO, MAESTRO,
THIS IS HELEN CHAPPEL.

13:07.912 --> 13:09.330
I GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

13:09.413 --> 13:10.831
YES?

13:10.915 --> 13:12.875
SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS?

13:12.958 --> 13:16.295
OH, NO, THAT SOUNDS REASONABLE.

13:16.378 --> 13:19.048
OKAY, THANK YOU.

13:19.131 --> 13:21.008
GREAT! YOU GOT THE JOB.

13:21.091 --> 13:22.426
NOT QUITE.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.386
WELL, WHAT WAS THE $700?

13:24.470 --> 13:26.055
BODY SHOP ESTIMATE.

13:26.138 --> 13:29.391
APPARENTLY, AS I LEFT
THE AUDITION HALL

13:29.475 --> 13:32.436
I DENTED HIS CAR
WITH MY CELLO CASE.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.730
HELEN, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

13:34.813 --> 13:37.274
OF COURSE I'M ALL RIGHT.

13:38.817 --> 13:40.778
COULDN'T BE BETTER.

13:42.321 --> 13:45.908
YOU KNOW, I JUST LOVE
WORKING HERE AT THE RITZ.

13:45.991 --> 13:48.744
{\an1}RUBBING SHOULDERS
WITH THE CREAM OF SOCIETY.

13:48.827 --> 13:51.747
{\an1}HAVING CONVERSATIONS
MADE UP OF ONE-SYLLABLE WORDS.

13:51.830 --> 13:54.416
GOOD SOUP. HOT.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.585
(<i> loud screaming</i> )

13:56.669 --> 13:58.087
LISTEN, HELEN...

13:58.170 --> 13:59.922
(<i> glass shattering</i> )

14:00.005 --> 14:02.049
SHE WANTS TO BE ALONE.

14:02.132 --> 14:04.593
I DID ALL I COULD
FOR THE POOR KID.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.554
YOU AND THAT
STUPID DRESS.

14:06.637 --> 14:09.223
CAN'T YOU EVER
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS?

14:09.306 --> 14:10.599
WHAT DID I DO?

14:10.683 --> 14:12.309
I MADE A SUGGESTION.

14:12.393 --> 14:13.811
WHERE'S THE HARM?

14:13.894 --> 14:16.313
{\an3}YOU GOT HER HOPES UP
FOR NOTHING.

14:16.397 --> 14:18.232
I WAS ONLY TRYING TO HELP.

14:18.315 --> 14:20.109
YOU'RE <i> REAL</i> HELPFUL.

14:20.192 --> 14:22.486
IF YOU'RE SO ANXIOUS
TO CHANGE SOMETHING

14:22.570 --> 14:23.779
START WITH YOURSELF.

14:23.862 --> 14:25.656
{\an1}OKAY, JOE,
HAVE IT YOUR WAY.

14:25.739 --> 14:27.908
{\an1}I PROMISE NEVER
TO CHANGE ANYTHING

14:27.992 --> 14:30.327
{\an1}EVER AGAIN
AS LONG AS I LIVE.

14:31.328 --> 14:32.788
WHAT ARE THESE?

14:32.871 --> 14:34.582
PAINT SAMPLES.

14:34.665 --> 14:37.251
WHY IS DAY-GLO ORANGE CIRCLED?

14:37.334 --> 14:38.794
DON'T SAY ANYTHING NOW.

14:38.877 --> 14:42.006
{\an1}WAIT TILL YOU SEE IT
ON THE PLANE, THEN DECIDE.

14:42.089 --> 14:43.966
WHAT?

14:45.217 --> 14:47.094
FAY! FAY!

14:47.177 --> 14:48.637
EXCUSE ME.

14:48.721 --> 14:49.722
GOOD NEWS.

14:49.805 --> 14:51.765
{\an1}YOU DECIDED
TO FINISH YOUR TRIP.

14:51.849 --> 14:53.767
I DECIDED TO STAY
IN NANTUCKET.

14:53.851 --> 14:56.186
I AM NEVER GOING BACK
TO NEW BEDFORD.

14:56.270 --> 14:58.814
{\an1}YOU'VE TOLD ME EVERYTHING
ABOUT YOUR LIFE

14:58.897 --> 15:01.609
INCLUDING
THAT STRANGE MEDICAL EXPERIMENT

15:01.692 --> 15:02.985
YOU VOLUNTEERED FOR.

15:03.068 --> 15:05.154
{\an1}THE ONE THING
YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME

15:05.237 --> 15:07.531
{\an1}IS WHY YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING TO DIE

15:07.615 --> 15:09.533
AS SOON AS YOU
GET BACK HOME?

15:09.617 --> 15:14.288
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL TELL YOU.

15:14.371 --> 15:18.167
I'VE ALWAYS DREAMED
THIS ONE GREAT ADVENTURE--

15:18.250 --> 15:20.836
FLYING SOLO
AROUND THE WORLD.

15:20.919 --> 15:23.005
SO I MADE A VOW TO GOD

15:23.088 --> 15:26.216
{\an3}THAT AS SOON AS THE TRIP
WAS FINISHED

15:26.300 --> 15:30.012
{\an3}HE COULD TAKE ME
AND I'D DIE A HAPPY MAN.

15:30.095 --> 15:31.972
THAT'S IT, HOWARD?

15:32.056 --> 15:34.391
KIND OF PAINTED MYSELF
IN A CORNER.

15:34.475 --> 15:35.851
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

15:35.934 --> 15:39.730
{\an1}YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST PERSON
WHO MADE A PACT WITH GOD.

15:39.813 --> 15:41.190
YOU DID?

15:41.273 --> 15:43.859
{\an1}YES, YEARS AGO,
WHEN I WAS A STEWARDESS.

15:43.942 --> 15:47.488
WE LOST AN ENGINE--
I WAS SURE WE WERE GOING DOWN--

15:47.571 --> 15:50.866
{\an1}AND I PROMISED GOD
IF HE GOT ME THROUGH IT ALIVE

15:50.949 --> 15:53.869
{\an1}I'D DEVOTE MY LIFE TO HIM
AND BECOME A NUN.

15:53.952 --> 15:54.995
REALLY?

15:55.079 --> 15:58.874
{\an3}HARD TO TELL NOW THAT YOU'VE
STOPPED WEARING HABITS.

15:58.957 --> 16:01.377
OH, HOWARD--
YOU'RE SUCH A MO-MO.

16:01.460 --> 16:05.506
I NEVER BECAME A NUN
AND NOTHING EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

16:05.589 --> 16:08.759
{\an1}SO I FIGURE
IF GOD REALLY KNOWS EVERYTHING

16:08.842 --> 16:12.012
THEN HE ALSO KNOWS
WHEN YOU'RE FULL OF IT.

16:12.096 --> 16:14.973
AND HOWARD-- TRUST ME.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.643
{\an1}HOWARD...

16:17.726 --> 16:19.269
GET ON THAT PLANE

16:19.353 --> 16:21.730
GO HOME AND OPEN
YOUR HAT STORE.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.857
YOUR MISSION IS NOT COMPLETE.

16:23.941 --> 16:28.028
THERE ARE A LOT OF HATLESS HEADS
OUT THERE WHO NEED YOU.

16:28.112 --> 16:31.365
I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT
THAT WAY, FAY.

16:31.448 --> 16:33.200
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

16:33.283 --> 16:35.244
YOU KNOW, NEXT WEEK OR SO...

16:35.327 --> 16:36.745
HOWARD. GO. NOW.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.372
YOU'RE A NICE MAN.

16:38.455 --> 16:41.417
{\an1}I DON'T WANT
TO HAVE TO SMACK YOU.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.501
YES, MA'AM.

16:44.378 --> 16:47.423
{\an1}OH, UH...
THANKS FOR THE PEP TALK, FAY.

16:47.506 --> 16:51.301
{\an1}WITHOUT YOU, I WOULDN'T BE
GETTING ON THAT PLANE.

16:51.385 --> 16:54.972
HOWARD'S DEAD AND I KILLED HIM.

16:55.055 --> 16:56.765
STOP SAYING THAT, FAY.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.809
WE DON'T KNOW THAT
FOR SURE.

16:58.892 --> 17:01.311
IT'S A 40 MINUTE TRIP
TO NEW BEDFORD

17:01.395 --> 17:03.480
AND HE'S BEEN GONE TWO HOURS.

17:03.564 --> 17:05.441
I SAY WE SEND OUT
A SEARCH PARTY

17:05.523 --> 17:06.817
TO LOOK FOR A HAT

17:06.900 --> 17:08.652
FLOATING ON TOP
OF THE WATER.

17:08.736 --> 17:09.987
DON'T BE AFRAID

17:10.069 --> 17:11.989
TO SHOW YOUR
TENDER SIDE.

17:12.071 --> 17:14.950
I'LL SHOW YOU
MY TENDER SIDE.

17:15.032 --> 17:17.327
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT HOWARD.

17:17.411 --> 17:19.621
THERE IS ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE.

17:19.704 --> 17:21.999
LIKE HE LANDED
AT ANOTHER AIRPORT

17:22.082 --> 17:23.709
AND HE'S SITTING THERE

17:23.791 --> 17:26.502
{\an3}ENJOYING A HOT CUP
OF COFFEE RIGHT NOW?

17:26.587 --> 17:29.965
{\an1}NO-- LIKE HE SLIPPED
THROUGH A HOLE IN THE UNIVERSE

17:30.048 --> 17:32.176
AND HE'S LOST SOMEWHERE IN TIME.

17:32.259 --> 17:34.970
{\an1}A HOLE
IN THE UNIVERSE, LOWELL?

17:35.053 --> 17:37.806
YEAH, THEY'RE EVERYWHERE.

17:37.890 --> 17:41.018
COSMIC POTHOLES,
I CALL THEM.

17:44.396 --> 17:47.316
HOWARD'S GONE.

17:47.399 --> 17:49.318
SO'S LOWELL.

17:49.401 --> 17:52.321
I CAN FEEL AN EMPTINESS
IN MY HEART.

17:52.404 --> 17:55.991
TRY ABOUT A
FOOT HIGHER, FAY.

17:56.074 --> 17:58.827
I THINK WE SHOULD ALL
BOW OUR HEADS

17:58.911 --> 18:01.663
{\an1}AND TAKE A MOMENT TO REMEMBER
HOWARD BANKS.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.999
A MOMENT OF SILENCE, PLEASE.

18:04.082 --> 18:05.501
{\an1}HELLO,
EVERYBODY.

18:05.584 --> 18:07.961
HOWARD! YOU'RE ALIVE!

18:08.045 --> 18:10.214
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

18:10.297 --> 18:12.841
JUST CIRCLING OFFSHORE
FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.343
I'M SORRY, FAY.

18:14.426 --> 18:17.012
{\an1}I JUST COULDN'T
GET RID OF THAT FEELING

18:17.096 --> 18:18.680
I WAS GOING TO DIE.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.182
YOU DIDN'T GO HOME?

18:20.265 --> 18:24.478
{\an1}NO, BUT I CAME UP
WITH A PLAN TO FOOL GOD.

18:24.561 --> 18:26.939
{\an1}I'M GOING TO FLY BACK
THE WAY I CAME

18:27.022 --> 18:28.482
RETRACING MY ROUTE

18:28.565 --> 18:30.734
{\an1}SO THAT WHEN I LAND
IN NEW BEDFORD

18:30.818 --> 18:35.197
TECHNICALLY, I WON'T HAVE FLOWN
COMPLETELY AROUND THE WORLD.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.699
LOWELL'S "HOLE
IN THE UNIVERSE" THEORY

18:37.783 --> 18:39.868
{\an3}IS STARTING TO SOUND
PRETTY GOOD.

18:39.952 --> 18:43.247
{\an1}TWO YEARS FROM NEXT SATURDAY,
YOU AND I HAVE A DATE.

18:43.330 --> 18:45.541
{\an1}YOU'LL HAVE TO COME
TO NEW BEDFORD

18:45.624 --> 18:49.044
{\an1}BECAUSE IF I COME TO YOU
THEN I'LL HAVE ALREADY FLOWN

18:49.127 --> 18:52.548
{\an1}COMPLETELY AROUND THE WORLD
IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION

18:52.631 --> 18:53.924
AND I'D DIE.

18:54.007 --> 18:57.219
{\an3}TWO YEARS
FROM THIS SATURDAY NIGHT?

18:57.302 --> 19:01.056
{\an1}GEE, HOWARD,
I THINK I'M WASHING MY HAIR.

19:01.139 --> 19:03.517
WELL, HOW ABOUT SUNDAY?

19:03.600 --> 19:04.560
I'M DRYING IT.

19:04.643 --> 19:06.728
HOW ABOUT THE NEXT WEEK?

19:06.812 --> 19:08.856
HOWARD, I'LL CALL YOU.

19:08.939 --> 19:10.399
OKAY.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.109
IT'S A DATE.

19:14.653 --> 19:20.617
THAT MAN IS NUTTIER THAN
A SQUIRREL'S CHEEKS IN OCTOBER.

19:25.622 --> 19:27.249
(<i> knocks</i> )

19:27.332 --> 19:28.709
{\an1}YOU OKAY?

19:28.792 --> 19:29.793
YEAH, I'M FINE.

19:29.877 --> 19:33.505
YOU'RE NOT CARRYING
ANY CONCEALED CROCKERY, ARE YOU?

19:33.589 --> 19:36.258
{\an1}I'M SORRY YOUR AUDITION
DIDN'T WORK OUT.

19:36.341 --> 19:39.052
{\an3}THAT'S ALL WATER
UNDER THE BRIDGE NOW--

19:39.136 --> 19:41.972
BITTER, FOUL, PUTREFYING WATER.

19:42.055 --> 19:43.432
HAD YOUR HOPES UP?

19:43.515 --> 19:45.601
IT'S ALL I EVER DREAM ABOUT

19:45.684 --> 19:48.228
{\an3}IS BEING
A PROFESSIONAL MUSICIAN.

19:48.312 --> 19:50.606
TO THINK I CAME SO CLOSE, JOE.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.941
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
IF THIS HELPS ANY

19:53.025 --> 19:55.777
BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT,
I HAD MIXED EMOTIONS.

19:55.861 --> 19:58.405
{\an1}I WOULD'VE BEEN HAPPY
IF YOU'D GOTTEN IT

19:58.488 --> 20:00.115
BUT I WOULD'VE MISSED YOU.

20:00.198 --> 20:02.159
I HAD MIXED
EMOTIONS, TOO.

20:02.242 --> 20:05.329
I WOULD'VE BEEN HAPPY
TO LEAVE THE ISLAND

20:05.412 --> 20:07.164
BUT I WOULD'VE BEEN SAD

20:07.247 --> 20:09.708
THAT IT TOOK ME
SO LONG TO DO IT.

20:11.209 --> 20:14.504
I WOULD'VE MISSED YOU--
YOU KNOW THAT.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.510
CAN I HELP YOU WITH SOMETHING?

20:20.594 --> 20:22.596
JOE,
I WAS WONDERING...

20:22.679 --> 20:25.766
REMEMBER WHEN YOU TOLD ME
IF I WON THE AUDITION

20:25.849 --> 20:29.269
{\an1}I WOULDN'T KNOW WHETHER IT WAS
MY DRESS OR MY TALENT?

20:29.353 --> 20:32.272
{\an1}I DIDN'T CONSIDER
HOW I WOULD FEEL IF I LOST.

20:32.356 --> 20:32.814
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

20:32.898 --> 20:33.857
I DIDN'T GET HIRED.

20:33.941 --> 20:37.611
EITHER MY CELLO PLAYING
IS LOUSY OR I'M NOT SEXY.

20:37.694 --> 20:40.030
YOU COULD HELP ME
FIGURE THIS OUT.

20:40.113 --> 20:40.989
WOULD YOU JUST LOOK AT ME
IN MY DRESS

20:41.073 --> 20:42.783
AND TELL ME IF I'M SEXY?

20:42.866 --> 20:45.369
I DON'T THINK ABOUT YOU
IN THAT WAY.

20:45.452 --> 20:51.458
BUDDIES DON'T TALK ABOUT
PERSONAL STUFF LIKE THIS.

20:51.541 --> 20:55.963
JOE, I'M NOT SUGGESTING
I HAVE YOUR BABY.

20:56.046 --> 20:58.882
JUST LOOK AT ME IN MY DRESS.

20:58.966 --> 21:00.133
ASK SOMEONE ELSE.

21:00.217 --> 21:02.010
WHO? BRIAN?

21:02.094 --> 21:03.512
GOOD POINT.

21:03.595 --> 21:05.806
BRIAN THINKS AIR IS SEXY.

21:05.889 --> 21:08.308
{\an1}LOOK, IF IT
MAKES IT ANY EASIER

21:08.392 --> 21:11.311
I'LL TELL YOU WHETHER
I THINK YOU'RE SEXY.

21:11.395 --> 21:12.980
{\an3}HELEN...

21:13.063 --> 21:14.982
JOE, JUST ASK ME.

21:15.065 --> 21:16.775
OKAY--
AM I SEXY?

21:16.858 --> 21:18.235
NOT PARTICULARLY.

21:18.318 --> 21:19.611
WHAT?

21:19.695 --> 21:20.988
IT'S A JOKE.

21:21.071 --> 21:23.240
{\an1}I WAS JUST
LOOSENING YOU UP.

21:23.323 --> 21:25.283
OF COURSE YOU'RE SEXY.

21:25.367 --> 21:26.702
NO, I'M NOT.

21:26.785 --> 21:28.537
YEAH, YOU ARE.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.080
NAH.

21:30.163 --> 21:31.206
MM-HMM.

21:31.289 --> 21:32.332
REALLY?

21:32.416 --> 21:33.500
HOW?

21:33.583 --> 21:34.584
I DON'T KNOW.

21:34.668 --> 21:38.714
I LIKE IT WHEN YOUR LITTLE EYES
KIND OF LIFT UP AND...

21:38.797 --> 21:40.090
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

21:40.173 --> 21:41.883
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ME.

21:41.967 --> 21:46.013
REMEMBER WHEN I ACCIDENTALLY
SAW YOU NAKED WHEN YOU WERE TEN?

21:46.096 --> 21:48.849
WE DIDN'T SPEAK AGAIN
UNTIL YOU WERE 12.

21:48.932 --> 21:51.059
COME ON, JOE, JUST SUCK IT UP.

21:51.143 --> 21:52.561
DO I LOOK SEXY

21:52.644 --> 21:55.522
OR AM I JUST A LOUSY CELLIST?

21:55.605 --> 21:57.149
WELL?

21:57.232 --> 21:59.026
(<i> stammering</i> )

21:59.109 --> 22:00.444
{\an1}THANKS.

22:00.527 --> 22:03.238
I BETTER GO PRACTICE.

22:13.331 --> 22:15.083
{\an1}WELL...

22:15.167 --> 22:17.252
THAT'S ONE CHANGE

22:17.336 --> 22:19.755
{\an1}YOU DON'T SEEM
TO MIND.
