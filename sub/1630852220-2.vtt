00:22.684 --> 00:25.004
Put your cigarettes out.

00:30.524 --> 00:32.802
Who's here, Pietro?

00:32.804 --> 00:34.762
Open it.

00:34.764 --> 00:38.081
ONE YEAR LATER

00:38.083 --> 00:39.841
Hello, little Pietro.

00:39.843 --> 00:43.961
- Azzurra, nice to meet you.
- Valeria. Please, come in.

00:43.963 --> 00:46.281
Sweetheart, let's show them the pool.

00:46.283 --> 00:48.163
- This way.
- Thank you.

00:49.243 --> 00:50.803
Look, there's Daddy!

00:51.963 --> 00:54.241
Gennaro, this is the party planner.

00:54.243 --> 00:57.881
- Gennaro Savastano.
- Valeria, "Dream Birthday".

00:57.883 --> 00:59.841
What attractions do you offer?

00:59.843 --> 01:04.680
There are inflatables, cotton candy,
mimes, clowns... Whatever you want.

01:04.682 --> 01:08.280
We'll take it all.
It has to be an amazing party.

01:08.282 --> 01:10.640
- How many kids are there in his class?
- Twenty-five.

01:10.642 --> 01:13.002
We have the invitations ready.

01:15.242 --> 01:19.080
- We'll need a hundred, though.
- Why do we need 100 invitations?

01:19.082 --> 01:22.920
We have to tell the whole school,
the neighborhood.

01:22.922 --> 01:25.399
- It has to be huge.
- Right.

01:25.401 --> 01:27.879
Sweetie, do you like these invitations?

01:27.881 --> 01:31.639
Just one favor...
Don't dress the girls like that.

01:31.641 --> 01:34.999
- They'll scare the kids.
- Don't worry.

01:35.001 --> 01:39.239
Maybe something more colorful,
if you don't mind.

01:39.241 --> 01:41.319
- I'll see them out.
- Yes.

01:41.321 --> 01:43.721
- Thank you, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

01:45.081 --> 01:48.120
- We'll dress them as clowns.
- Good call.

02:16.079 --> 02:20.117
Gennaro, I'd like you to meet
Alberto Resta.

02:20.119 --> 02:22.717
His grandfather built half Naples.

02:22.719 --> 02:26.517
- And he and his father the rest.
- Michele likes to exaggerate.

02:26.519 --> 02:28.559
I know your résumé.

02:30.159 --> 02:34.077
But you don't get to know people
through their track records, do you?

02:34.079 --> 02:39.996
You're right.
My family taught me to speak in facts.

02:39.998 --> 02:43.276
Michele told me you have set up
a consortium to transform

02:43.278 --> 02:47.156
this abandoned place
into the largest airport in Campania.

02:47.158 --> 02:49.278
A huge undertaking.

02:50.718 --> 02:55.076
Yes, and the only thing I'm missing
is someone like you.

02:55.078 --> 02:57.156
A leading businessman

02:57.158 --> 03:00.955
who rescued the family business
and lot of workers.

03:00.957 --> 03:03.197
This does you credit.

03:05.157 --> 03:08.677
But now you're deep in debt
and the banks are after you.

03:11.677 --> 03:15.357
If you decide to head the consortium,
I'll give you 15%.

03:16.717 --> 03:21.075
Thank you, it's a fine offer,
but I can't accept.

03:21.077 --> 03:23.874
The banks are after me.

03:23.876 --> 03:27.154
At the moment
I don't have funds to buy shares.

03:27.156 --> 03:29.634
I'll give them to you anyway.

03:29.636 --> 03:33.034
You can give me the money
when our planes are in the air.

03:33.036 --> 03:35.194
On one condition, though:

03:35.196 --> 03:40.474
hiring, acquisitions and contracts
must all be according to law.

03:40.476 --> 03:44.274
Above reproach.

03:44.276 --> 03:48.233
That's not a problem,
I'm used to playing clean.

03:48.235 --> 03:50.673
Good man.

03:50.675 --> 03:53.755
So, Alberto, I guess
I can call you by name now.

05:05.792 --> 05:07.910
You fucking scum, get outta here!

05:07.912 --> 05:11.190
You fucking assholes,
go back where you came from!

05:11.192 --> 05:14.270
Go away, you bastards!

05:14.272 --> 05:15.990
Piece of shit!

05:15.992 --> 05:18.030
Go back to the sewers!

05:18.032 --> 05:19.392
Get outta here!

05:26.551 --> 05:31.071
- Sweetheart...
- Daddy, the smell's come back.

05:33.191 --> 05:35.591
Know what we'll do?

05:36.751 --> 05:38.671
We'll shut it out.

06:30.789 --> 06:32.149
Maria.

06:33.949 --> 06:35.427
Why aren't you in bed?

06:35.429 --> 06:39.146
I'm fine, Giovanni,
why would I be in bed?

06:39.148 --> 06:41.706
Hello, my darling.

06:41.708 --> 06:44.626
They're so pretty, did you pick them?

06:44.628 --> 06:46.828
What's in your backpack?

06:49.628 --> 06:51.628
Are there any toys?

06:53.708 --> 06:55.468
Let me see.

07:03.787 --> 07:06.107
When do you get the results?

07:17.747 --> 07:21.345
- Have they told you anything?
- I already got them.

07:21.347 --> 07:22.907
And?

07:24.466 --> 07:26.546
I got them today.

07:28.746 --> 07:31.584
- I'm coming home.
- How's that possible?

07:31.586 --> 07:33.544
Are you really coming home?

07:33.546 --> 07:36.146
I really am! Are you happy, my love?

07:59.505 --> 08:01.385
- Alberto.
- Hi, Gennaro.

08:03.225 --> 08:06.265
- Well?
- It makes a good impression.

08:08.145 --> 08:10.625
I'll show you the rest, come.

08:16.584 --> 08:19.782
Here, it's all still work in progress.

08:19.784 --> 08:21.902
But...

08:21.904 --> 08:24.422
This is your office.

08:24.424 --> 08:28.022
It's wonderful! I can't wait to start.

08:28.024 --> 08:29.984
I'll show you the rest.

08:31.104 --> 08:34.861
- Did you see the list of those guys?
- They all have an excellent CV.

08:34.864 --> 08:37.863
It's the only way to win,
with top people.

08:39.943 --> 08:42.143
This is the project.

08:45.383 --> 08:50.101
We have to buy the land
before we apply to manage the airport.

08:50.103 --> 08:53.301
How long have we got
to present the investment plans?

08:53.303 --> 08:55.581
- Until the end of the month.
- We better hurry.

08:55.583 --> 08:58.861
- I wanted to ask you something.
- What is it?

08:58.863 --> 09:02.260
There's someone
who has always been by my side,

09:02.262 --> 09:05.300
a very accomplished
and honest young woman.

09:05.302 --> 09:08.540
I'd like to have her by my side
on this project, too.

09:08.542 --> 09:11.422
Not a problem. Introduce her to me.

09:15.222 --> 09:19.340
Hi, Tiziana.
Tiziana Palumbo, Gennaro Savastano.

09:19.342 --> 09:22.260
- Pleased to meet you.
- My pleasure.

09:22.262 --> 09:23.661
Please.

09:28.621 --> 09:30.259
Well...

09:30.261 --> 09:33.499
Tiziana graduated in London,
at the top of her class

09:33.501 --> 09:36.981
and straight after that
she began working with me.

09:38.181 --> 09:39.899
You know, Alberto,

09:39.901 --> 09:44.699
lots of our youth, the brightest,
go to study abroad.

09:44.701 --> 09:48.298
Because in this shit country
they have no opportunities.

09:48.300 --> 09:52.100
Whereas you came back to fight,
that takes courage.

09:55.540 --> 09:58.898
You're giving us a huge opportunity.

09:58.900 --> 10:03.060
If I can be at your side,
then that courage has been rewarded.

10:11.979 --> 10:14.299
Good boy, sweetheart. Your hand...

10:15.659 --> 10:17.779
The other hand.

10:19.939 --> 10:22.139
Good.

10:23.739 --> 10:26.339
What is it, Gennaro?
Are you dreaming?

10:27.779 --> 10:31.577
I was thinking about
what's gonna happen when he's older.

10:31.579 --> 10:34.499
After he's studied in London,
or in America.

10:37.778 --> 10:40.016
What people will think
when they hear his last name.

10:40.018 --> 10:43.016
And what will they say?

10:43.018 --> 10:46.736
That's Pietro Savastano,
the great musician!

10:46.738 --> 10:49.896
Or engineer, architect...

10:49.898 --> 10:52.416
Or astronaut? Eh, Pietro?

10:52.418 --> 10:54.738
Do you want to be an astronaut, darling?

10:58.578 --> 11:00.857
That's what they'll say.

11:02.377 --> 11:05.457
Are you ready? Shall we go to school?

11:26.376 --> 11:28.576
Is this the song you like?

11:30.136 --> 11:32.096
This is it, right?

11:33.696 --> 11:35.056
How does it go?

11:56.415 --> 11:58.933
See you later?

11:58.935 --> 12:01.535
- You're not coming in today either?
- Next time.

12:03.375 --> 12:06.973
- Say goodbye to Daddy.
- Be good.

12:06.975 --> 12:10.133
- We'll see you later.
- Bye.

12:10.135 --> 12:12.694
Let's go, give me your hand.

12:35.573 --> 12:37.051
Hi, Annachiara.

12:37.053 --> 12:39.733
- Good morning.
- How are you?

12:41.533 --> 12:45.053
- If you need anything, we're here.
- Thank you, Maria will be happy.

12:46.573 --> 12:49.653
Well, Clara... Annachiara, all good?

12:51.533 --> 12:54.053
You did your homework? Let's go.

13:01.252 --> 13:03.570
- Gennaro.
- Well?

13:03.572 --> 13:07.652
We got half the land
in just a few days, look.

13:09.092 --> 13:12.650
- And the rest?
- Negotiations are underway.

13:12.652 --> 13:16.490
To speed things up, if you agree,

13:16.492 --> 13:19.090
I'd raise our bid by 20%.

13:19.092 --> 13:20.770
Perfect.

13:20.772 --> 13:23.811
- Will you take care of it?
- Of course, right away.

13:25.091 --> 13:28.051
Come, I've had all the plans printed.

13:31.811 --> 13:35.369
Multi-storey carparks, shopping mall.

13:35.371 --> 13:37.649
- We got the green light.
- This is the hotel.

13:37.651 --> 13:40.091
We'll raise our bid by 20%.

13:42.811 --> 13:45.329
And this is the highway turn-off.

13:45.331 --> 13:47.051
It goes to the airport?

13:49.930 --> 13:54.088
Good job, Alberto.
Do we have anyone in City Hall?

13:54.090 --> 13:57.368
Yes, the council wants
to build a new stadium.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.688
Good, let's give them
200,000 euros right away.

13:59.690 --> 14:03.208
Right, so people will know
we're with them straight off.

14:03.210 --> 14:07.128
Good. And we'll let them know
we'll forego the triplication

14:07.130 --> 14:10.728
of the value of the land
that the law guarantees us.

14:10.730 --> 14:14.609
So with that money
the City can fix up schools and housing.

14:15.809 --> 14:19.609
In all my career I've never heard
anyone talk like that.

14:22.609 --> 14:25.209
Because we are the change.

15:16.047 --> 15:17.487
Hello?

15:19.687 --> 15:21.687
Hi, Alberto.

15:23.686 --> 15:25.246
I'll be there soon.

15:44.446 --> 15:47.725
- Hi, Alberto.
- Hi, Gennaro. Come.

15:50.885 --> 15:53.123
See that land?

15:53.125 --> 15:56.803
The hay bales, that fucking white house?

15:56.805 --> 15:59.323
The owner doesn't want to sell.

15:59.325 --> 16:01.403
- How much did we offer?
- 300,000.

16:01.405 --> 16:05.043
It's six times its value.
The asshole said no.

16:05.045 --> 16:08.245
He's not selling on principle,
it's not a matter of money.

16:10.125 --> 16:12.362
It's always a matter of money.

16:12.364 --> 16:15.762
Or else there's something going on.
And you gotta find out what it is.

16:15.764 --> 16:19.082
You don't get it,
it's not something I can solve.

16:19.084 --> 16:21.682
You need to frighten him,
use strong-arm tactics.

16:21.684 --> 16:25.724
He needs to realize if he doesn't sell,
it's the worst deal of his life.

16:39.643 --> 16:42.521
I don't think I heard correctly.

16:42.523 --> 16:45.043
By any chance
did you give me an order?

16:46.843 --> 16:48.843
No, Gennaro...

16:51.243 --> 16:53.363
But we need this land.

18:47.678 --> 18:50.396
You need a hand? Are you lost?

18:50.398 --> 18:54.198
I was looking for you.
Gennaro Savastano.

18:56.718 --> 18:58.638
I have an offer for you.

19:01.837 --> 19:05.675
If you're one of the people who wants
to buy my land, I'm not selling.

19:05.677 --> 19:07.917
I've already told your friends.

19:24.756 --> 19:27.436
I have a wife and kid too.

19:38.396 --> 19:43.036
In a clinic in Brazil they can cure
the cancer your wife has.

19:45.596 --> 19:49.873
For less than 300,000 euros they can do
a liver transplant and it's all fixed.

19:49.875 --> 19:52.553
If you sign the papers,
it's all ready to go.

19:52.555 --> 19:55.435
I can have you on a flight
tomorrow morning.

19:56.595 --> 19:59.673
There's no hope for my wife.

19:59.675 --> 20:02.553
The doctor was clear about that.

20:02.555 --> 20:04.913
And what else could they say?

20:04.915 --> 20:08.953
Do you know how much a liver transplant
costs in a public hospital?

20:08.955 --> 20:12.834
They don't operate on people
who don't have many chances.

20:14.674 --> 20:18.192
Is it better to have fewer chances
or none at all?

20:18.194 --> 20:20.074
Think about it.

20:23.274 --> 20:25.434
You'll find me here.

20:26.434 --> 20:28.194
But not forever.

20:33.754 --> 20:35.673
Goodbye.

21:05.912 --> 21:09.832
Mom. Thank you, Mom.

21:12.072 --> 21:16.310
- Hello, my darling.
- Hi.

21:16.312 --> 21:18.990
- Say hello to Mommy nicely.
- Come here.

21:18.992 --> 21:23.349
Maria, take it easy.
Maria, what are you doing?

21:23.351 --> 21:26.391
As long as I'm here
I'll hold my daughter in my arms.

21:52.750 --> 21:55.230
Yeah, let's go to a pizzeria.

22:27.069 --> 22:29.749
- Here are your scuffs.
- Thanks.

22:44.828 --> 22:47.146
You have to find
another wife, Giovanni.

22:47.148 --> 22:50.826
A good woman,
the girl needs a mother.

22:50.828 --> 22:52.708
What are you talking about?

22:54.388 --> 22:56.428
I don't care about dying.

22:58.148 --> 23:01.267
I want to rest, I can't fight anymore.

23:05.707 --> 23:08.867
But I can't imagine
not seeing her anymore.

23:14.147 --> 23:17.787
Someone came and told me something.

23:19.027 --> 23:20.747
What?

23:25.186 --> 23:27.146
They want the land.

23:33.106 --> 23:37.144
But in exchange, this person said

23:37.146 --> 23:40.464
he can get you
into a hospital in Brazil.

23:40.466 --> 23:42.106
That's what he said.

23:45.186 --> 23:47.025
- In Brazil?
- Yes.

23:49.585 --> 23:53.225
He said they can give you a transplant.

23:55.465 --> 23:57.503
He'll get you on the list.

23:57.505 --> 24:01.665
He said there are livers available,
that's what he said.

24:04.465 --> 24:06.545
And who is this person?

24:09.065 --> 24:11.024
He's not a nice person.

24:13.544 --> 24:16.344
We even have
somewhere to stay in Brazil.

25:18.342 --> 25:21.980
- Hello?
- Gennaro, any news?

25:21.982 --> 25:23.539
Not yet.

25:23.541 --> 25:27.659
- Time's running out.
- <i>I'm taking care of it.</i>

25:27.661 --> 25:30.741
He won't sell.
Our planes will never fly.

25:33.861 --> 25:37.541
- Here's Dad.
- Daddy's boy!

25:49.540 --> 25:52.738
- Giovanni.
- What is it, honey?

25:52.740 --> 25:57.540
I want to go.
I don't give a shit who this person is.

25:59.740 --> 26:03.498
To smell the scent of my daughter's hair
for even one day more

26:03.500 --> 26:06.098
I'll walk to Brazil.

26:06.100 --> 26:08.220
I promise, I can make it.

27:27.536 --> 27:29.136
What do you want?

27:32.216 --> 27:34.136
What do you want?

28:21.694 --> 28:23.854
I'm still waiting for the call.

28:29.694 --> 28:31.414
Why didn't you call me?

28:53.173 --> 28:57.653
Because you disgust me.
Now get off my land.

29:38.931 --> 29:40.251
Gennaro.

29:44.851 --> 29:46.290
Everything okay?

29:49.410 --> 29:51.370
What the fuck did you do, Alberto?

29:55.410 --> 29:58.568
Try to understand,
time was running out.

29:58.570 --> 30:04.048
Something had to be done,
we couldn't just stand around waiting.

30:04.050 --> 30:07.490
Being enterprising means
making moves.

30:17.609 --> 30:19.649
But you made a bad move.

30:50.768 --> 30:55.726
- Hi, Uncle.
- Gennaro, well? How are things?

30:55.728 --> 30:57.328
All good.

30:59.567 --> 31:02.605
- You look well.
- So do you.

31:02.607 --> 31:05.005
So, tell me, why did you call me?

31:05.007 --> 31:07.167
I want to show you something.

31:09.167 --> 31:11.607
You know this area is full of poison.

31:13.967 --> 31:18.125
I need to know which land is clean
and which is contaminated

31:18.127 --> 31:20.127
and who made money off it.

31:23.086 --> 31:25.284
Around here, people are strange.

31:25.286 --> 31:27.084
Now everyone's protesting,

31:27.086 --> 31:30.964
but in the past many of them
didn't think it was a problem

31:30.966 --> 31:34.084
if you couldn't drink tap water anymore.

31:34.086 --> 31:36.726
As long as you had money
to buy mineral water.

31:38.686 --> 31:42.324
Give me a little time
and I'll let you know as soon as I can.

31:42.326 --> 31:43.846
Thank you.

31:59.485 --> 32:00.885
Hi, baby.

32:02.005 --> 32:04.405
Gennaro, everything okay?

32:05.525 --> 32:07.165
So-so.

32:19.364 --> 32:22.642
Why are these invitations still here
if the party is the day after tomorrow?

32:22.644 --> 32:24.882
Daddy doesn't know yet.

32:24.884 --> 32:28.002
We decided that on Saturday
it will just be the three of us.

32:28.004 --> 32:29.682
Right, darling?

32:29.684 --> 32:35.801
We'll go out to lunch,
then we'll go to the amusement park...

32:35.803 --> 32:38.003
Then we'll go to the movies.

32:44.523 --> 32:46.721
What happened?

32:46.723 --> 32:49.883
I gave out the invitations last week.

32:51.603 --> 32:56.321
I put them on the coat racks.

32:56.323 --> 32:57.883
Nobody took them.

33:00.362 --> 33:03.040
They stayed there for two days.

33:03.042 --> 33:07.922
In the end I took them away,
so at least Pietro wouldn't notice.

33:13.242 --> 33:14.962
Listen to me, Gennaro...

33:16.802 --> 33:19.720
Pietro is happier this way.

33:19.722 --> 33:24.839
We'll go to the movies,
we'll get ice cream.

33:24.841 --> 33:27.441
It will just be the three of us.

33:29.001 --> 33:31.641
Don't worry.

33:57.640 --> 33:59.920
Let's go see, Cheetah.

34:04.080 --> 34:06.600
- Is this the guy?
- Now we'll see.

34:39.918 --> 34:41.358
You didn't understand?

34:42.998 --> 34:45.118
You're not welcome here.

34:49.717 --> 34:52.876
You know, Giovanni,
I couldn't understand.

34:52.878 --> 34:54.358
I swear to you.

34:56.158 --> 35:00.517
I have a wife and a child, I wouldn't
have thought twice about it.

35:02.957 --> 35:05.357
"So, what the fuck
has he got to think about?"

35:09.837 --> 35:13.795
I was curious
so I asked a few questions.

35:13.797 --> 35:15.797
And you know what I found out?

35:16.997 --> 35:20.915
The most dangerous shit
isn't what you can see,

35:20.917 --> 35:23.396
it's what you can't see.

35:26.716 --> 35:32.036
Where did you bury the poison?
There? Behind there?

35:35.676 --> 35:38.316
I did what everybody else did.

35:40.396 --> 35:45.116
I needed money.
It was just a few drums.

35:49.555 --> 35:51.075
I know.

35:52.795 --> 35:54.995
That's why you didn't want to sell.

35:56.435 --> 35:59.035
You didn't want anyone
to find out the truth.

36:02.155 --> 36:05.435
Does your wife know
she's dying because of you?

36:10.474 --> 36:13.674
Does your daughter know
what a shitty father you are?

36:16.874 --> 36:18.914
You know what we'll do now?

36:20.794 --> 36:24.234
You'll take this money. Take it.

36:26.554 --> 36:29.152
You go somewhere nice,
far from here.

36:29.154 --> 36:31.714
Far from all this shit.

36:42.713 --> 36:46.633
- But wasn't it 300,000 euros?
- Before.

36:48.113 --> 36:51.993
The time for good deeds is over,
now you do what I say.

36:56.073 --> 37:00.112
With the rest of the money I have
to remove the shit you put under here.

37:02.832 --> 37:04.952
I'll see you at the notary's office.

38:00.790 --> 38:03.348
Sorry, can I help you?

38:03.350 --> 38:05.948
School's not over yet.

38:05.950 --> 38:07.550
Did you hear me?

38:28.829 --> 38:30.909
Mr Savastano, good morning.

38:32.149 --> 38:35.146
- No, you can't stay here.
- Today is Pietro's birthday.

38:35.148 --> 38:39.308
I know. You can't come into my classroom
like this, there are rules.

38:42.028 --> 38:44.706
My son has to celebrate
like all the other kids.

38:44.708 --> 38:47.308
The other kids don't celebrate in class.

38:50.828 --> 38:54.828
Look how many presents!
Shall we unwrap them?

39:33.306 --> 39:35.786
They'll give you all the information.

39:37.026 --> 39:39.186
I'll see you, have a good day.

39:50.105 --> 39:53.263
There are problems
in Simone's class.

39:53.265 --> 39:55.463
Can you check it out?

39:55.465 --> 39:56.865
Two minutes.

40:37.583 --> 40:40.223
Mr Resta, there's a package for you.

40:41.503 --> 40:43.381
At this hour?

40:43.383 --> 40:47.183
- Did they say who they were?
- No, I found it outside the door.

40:48.503 --> 40:50.223
Give it here.

40:51.583 --> 40:54.343
- Where are you going, Dad?
- I'll be right back.

41:26.501 --> 41:28.819
Dad, we're done, can we go?

41:28.821 --> 41:31.899
No! Simona, keep them in there!

41:31.901 --> 41:34.099
Keep them in there!

41:34.101 --> 41:37.581
- What's going on?
- Stay there!
