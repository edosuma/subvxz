00:02.669 --> 00:05.087
NARRATOR: Last time on
Star Trek: The Next Generation:

00:05.255 --> 00:07.881
My friend tells me you might know
about that man we're looking for.

00:08.049 --> 00:10.009
There was a group of aliens
sitting at this table.

00:10.176 --> 00:11.343
He was asking them questions.

00:11.511 --> 00:14.304
One of them took out a weapon
and fired.

00:14.472 --> 00:15.931
He was vaporized.

00:16.099 --> 00:17.683
This is about justice.

00:17.851 --> 00:20.936
The captain died
in a bar fight for nothing.

00:35.785 --> 00:39.288
Those ruins
have been studied for centuries.

00:39.456 --> 00:41.749
There's nothing new
to learn from them.

00:41.916 --> 00:43.250
Then what were you doing there?

00:45.086 --> 00:46.336
[GASPS THEN GRUNTS

00:46.629 --> 00:49.131
Baran wouldn't last five minutes
as captain

00:49.299 --> 00:51.216
if he didn't have that control device.

00:51.676 --> 00:54.386
That almost sounds
like a prelude to mutiny.

00:54.554 --> 00:55.596
They captured me.

00:55.764 --> 00:58.682
They wanted to find out how much
I knew about their operation.

00:58.850 --> 01:00.350
And then you became
part of their crew?

01:00.518 --> 01:03.312
I convinced them I was a smuggler.

01:03.480 --> 01:06.190
Will, these are not common thieves.

01:06.357 --> 01:08.233
They are stealing Romulan artifacts

01:08.401 --> 01:10.986
from archaeological sites
throughout this sector.

01:14.157 --> 01:17.826
Mr. Worf, prepare to drop shields.

01:18.244 --> 01:21.205
Sir, we would be totally defenseless.

01:21.581 --> 01:22.831
I am aware of that.

01:23.374 --> 01:24.416
Fire.

01:29.130 --> 01:31.757
NARRATOR:
And now the conclusion.

01:35.011 --> 01:36.470
[RED ALERT WAILlNG

01:37.055 --> 01:38.514
Direct hit to the port nacelle.

01:39.015 --> 01:40.516
Only minimal damage.

01:41.935 --> 01:45.395
Hit to the starboard nacelle.
Still no appreciable damage.

01:45.563 --> 01:47.689
Will must have done something
to their weapons.

01:47.857 --> 01:52.361
I believe you are right, counselor.
It is now up to us to play along.

01:52.529 --> 01:55.823
Release inertial dampers
and cut power to Decks 31 through 37.

01:55.990 --> 01:58.408
ENSlGN: Aye, sir.
- Set phasers to 25 percent.

01:59.661 --> 02:02.788
- Return fire.
- Aye, sir.

02:07.335 --> 02:08.377
Continue firing.

02:08.545 --> 02:09.586
[ALARM WAILlNG

02:09.754 --> 02:12.005
I've lost three plasma relays
on the disruptors.

02:12.173 --> 02:15.175
Auxiliary power is not available.

02:15.343 --> 02:17.553
Transfer weapons control
to my station.

02:17.720 --> 02:21.181
There's a way to bypass the relays
and feed power--

02:23.226 --> 02:25.477
The antimatter containment units
are starting to buckle.

02:25.895 --> 02:27.896
The Enterprise
has been badly damaged,

02:28.064 --> 02:29.982
but they still have superior firepower.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.651
If we remain here,
we will be destroyed.

02:32.819 --> 02:35.320
The logical course of action
is to withdraw.

02:40.410 --> 02:43.078
We've done enough damage.
Narik, set course.

02:43.538 --> 02:46.498
One-eight-zero, mark 21 5.

02:46.666 --> 02:50.085
Warp 6. Initiate.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.258
They're preparing to activate
their warp drive, commander.

02:56.426 --> 03:00.012
Sir, we cannot track them
with our sensors if they go to warp.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.221
I can still disable them--

03:01.389 --> 03:03.765
I am aware of the tactical situation,
lieutenant.

03:03.933 --> 03:04.975
Let them go.

03:44.807 --> 03:48.936
PICARD:
Space, the final frontier.

03:49.604 --> 03:53.565
These are the voyages
ofthe starship Enterprise.

03:53.733 --> 03:58.820
Its continuing mission:
to explore strange new worlds,

03:59.197 --> 04:03.575
to seek out new life
and new civilizations,

04:03.743 --> 04:07.996
to boldly go where no one
has gone before.

05:10.476 --> 05:14.896
I've gone over every word,
every inflection, every facial response,

05:15.064 --> 05:18.025
and I still can't find any kind of code
or hidden message.

05:18.192 --> 05:20.736
I agree the existence
of such a message is remote,

05:20.903 --> 05:22.279
but I believe we should check.

05:22.739 --> 05:24.531
I'll keep trying.

05:26.284 --> 05:28.910
Two starships have been sent
to intercept the mercenaries

05:29.078 --> 05:30.454
at Yadalla Prime and Draken IV

05:30.621 --> 05:32.789
in case they attempt
to attack those planets.

05:33.207 --> 05:37.002
Inform Starfleet Command that we
will hold position until further notice.

05:37.754 --> 05:39.921
So we are just going to remain here?

05:40.089 --> 05:43.842
Yes, but we will continue to pursue
all avenues of investigation.

05:45.803 --> 05:49.348
If we had not let them escape,
this would not be necessary.

05:49.515 --> 05:50.766
That is correct.

05:50.933 --> 05:53.560
But l believe Commander Riker
wanted us to let them escape.

05:53.728 --> 05:55.645
LA FORGE: Commander,
I think I found something.

05:57.273 --> 05:59.274
I've been studying the comlink
Commander Riker used

05:59.442 --> 06:01.318
to transmit his command codes.

06:01.486 --> 06:04.154
I didn't see anything at first,
but then l ran the transmission

06:04.322 --> 06:06.990
through a subharmonic analysis
and I found this.

06:07.158 --> 06:09.868
It was sent by the same carrier wave
as the command codes.

06:10.036 --> 06:12.079
It might be the message
we've been looking for.

06:12.246 --> 06:16.375
Possibly. l will attempt
to re-sequence the signal.

06:16.584 --> 06:19.419
Begin running a search
for a decryption key.

06:24.842 --> 06:26.802
I'm taking the engines off-line.

06:26.969 --> 06:29.638
BARAN: How long will it take
to repair our battle damage?

06:29.806 --> 06:31.890
It will take at least five hours

06:32.058 --> 06:34.434
to replace
the antimatter containment unit.

06:34.602 --> 06:36.645
You have three hours, Narik.

06:36.813 --> 06:40.565
One minute beyond that,
and you'll answer for it with your life.

06:42.568 --> 06:45.320
I suppose I should thank you.

06:47.490 --> 06:50.826
None of us would be alive
if it weren't for you.

06:51.702 --> 06:53.286
You're welcome.

06:53.454 --> 06:55.705
What's wrong, commander?

06:55.873 --> 06:58.834
You're having second thoughts
about betraying your comrades?

06:59.001 --> 07:00.794
Because that's what you've done.

07:00.962 --> 07:02.838
Betrayed them.

07:03.005 --> 07:06.174
Betrayed them
in order to save yourself.

07:06.717 --> 07:09.177
You used to be
just a second-rate officer.

07:09.345 --> 07:11.930
Now you're a traitor and a coward.

07:12.098 --> 07:14.516
How does that feel?

07:15.518 --> 07:16.643
[PICARD GRUNTS]

07:16.811 --> 07:19.146
- I don't know, how did that feel?
BARAN: Enough.

07:19.313 --> 07:23.066
Galen, go down to the cargo hold,
check out those artifacts.

07:24.318 --> 07:26.027
Move.

07:40.376 --> 07:44.045
You can tell Baran
that I'm working as fast as I can.

07:47.258 --> 07:48.550
What?

07:48.718 --> 07:51.470
I'm trying to decide
if you're incredibly stupid

07:51.637 --> 07:53.221
or incredibly smart.

07:54.098 --> 07:56.057
Why didn't you continue to fire
on the Enterprise

07:56.225 --> 07:57.559
when their shields dropped?

07:58.060 --> 08:01.229
You were there.
The disruptors lost power.

08:01.397 --> 08:05.066
Computer, reset for diagnostic
of new sample. Begin scan.

08:05.234 --> 08:08.278
I've watched you handle
the weapon systems before.

08:08.446 --> 08:11.865
You know exactly
how to bypass a problem like that.

08:12.241 --> 08:14.993
And why do you continue
to argue with Riker?

08:15.161 --> 08:17.245
It should be obvious
that by alienating Riker,

08:17.413 --> 08:21.333
you also alienate Baran,
and yet you continue to do so. Why?

08:21.834 --> 08:24.836
COMPUTER: Scan complete.
Terikon profile negative.

08:25.004 --> 08:28.507
PICARD: Computer, reset diagnostic
for new sample and begin scan.

08:28.674 --> 08:33.428
Look, this isn't a Romulan labor camp.
I don't have to answer your questions.

08:33.971 --> 08:36.056
And I don't give a damn
what you think.

08:36.682 --> 08:40.685
COMPUTER: Scan complete.
Terikon profile positive.

08:40.853 --> 08:43.688
Ninety-eight percent
probability of match.

08:45.900 --> 08:51.363
Well, whatever it is we're looking for,
it seems that we've found it.

08:51.531 --> 08:54.449
- Tallera to captain.
BARAN [OVER COM]: Yes, what is it?

08:54.617 --> 08:56.034
I'm in the cargo hold.

08:56.202 --> 08:59.120
Galen's made a positive Terikon match
on one of the artifacts.

08:59.288 --> 09:02.874
Good. Bring it to me immediately.
Don't let anyone get near it.

09:03.042 --> 09:05.377
TALLERA:
Understood. Tallera out.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.337
RlKER:
That sounds like good news.

09:07.505 --> 09:09.089
Very.

09:11.467 --> 09:14.302
It means we've completed half
of what promises to be

09:14.470 --> 09:17.097
a very profitable mission.

09:17.265 --> 09:18.682
And even better than that,

09:18.849 --> 09:21.977
I'm almost ready
to get rid of your friend Galen.

09:22.144 --> 09:23.186
Really?

09:23.354 --> 09:26.356
There's one more artifact to find.

09:26.774 --> 09:30.986
Once Galen confirms
that it's genuine,

09:31.153 --> 09:35.407
his usefulness on this ship
will come to a very sudden end.

09:35.992 --> 09:37.867
I can't say I'm sorry to hear that.

09:38.035 --> 09:42.289
Galen might be a loud-mouthed fool,
but sometimes he's quite perceptive.

09:42.999 --> 09:46.001
His observations about you,
for instance.

09:46.377 --> 09:49.170
- Oh?
- After what you did on Calder II,

09:49.338 --> 09:53.049
I doubt if you have much of a future
in Starfleet.

09:54.093 --> 09:55.135
Hmm.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.346
Yes.

09:58.514 --> 10:00.432
I must say,
I've come to the same conclusion.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.891
[RIKER CHUCKLES]

10:02.059 --> 10:06.855
Hmm. Well, assuming
that you were not my prisoner,

10:07.023 --> 10:08.356
what would you do now?

10:10.901 --> 10:13.153
I guess l'd start looking
for a new career.

10:13.362 --> 10:14.487
Ah.

10:14.655 --> 10:17.198
There must be a place
where someone with 1 5 years

10:17.366 --> 10:20.744
of Starfleet technical knowledge
would be useful.

10:21.829 --> 10:23.622
You wouldn't happen to know
a place like that?

10:23.789 --> 10:25.206
Well...

10:25.374 --> 10:27.042
Well, possibly.

10:27.543 --> 10:29.961
However, there's one thing
that I have learned on this ship,

10:30.129 --> 10:32.422
and that's to be cautious.

10:32.590 --> 10:36.801
And never to blindly embrace
what might appear to be good fortune.

10:36.969 --> 10:41.389
And right now you're a rather
large stroke of good luck.

10:42.892 --> 10:48.104
I haven't exactly sworn my undying
allegiance to you either, Baran.

10:48.272 --> 10:50.899
For instance, l'd like to know
a little bit more about this job.

10:51.067 --> 10:52.108
Such as?

10:53.069 --> 10:56.071
Such as what you meant
by very profitable mission.

10:57.406 --> 11:01.076
Well, it's enough to know right now
that your share will ensure you

11:01.243 --> 11:06.122
a very wealthy and long life,
far from the Federation.

11:06.290 --> 11:08.541
- Sounds promising.
- It is.

11:08.709 --> 11:10.627
Only you're gonna have to earn it.

11:10.795 --> 11:13.254
And you can start by putting aside
your dislike for Galen,

11:13.422 --> 11:14.631
becoming his friend.

11:14.799 --> 11:17.300
- Why?
- Galen has allies on this ship.

11:17.468 --> 11:21.388
That could cause trouble
if I decide to kill him.

11:21.555 --> 11:24.224
I want you to find out from him
who they are.

11:26.560 --> 11:27.769
Okay.

11:27.937 --> 11:30.480
One more thing, Riker.

11:31.232 --> 11:35.777
When the time comes,
I want you to kill Galen.

11:46.789 --> 11:50.709
I have completed my analysis
of the signal from the mercenary ship.

11:50.876 --> 11:53.336
I believe these groupings
represent bearings and coordinates

11:53.504 --> 11:55.171
taken from their navigational system.

11:55.673 --> 11:58.341
- So you think this is their flight plan?
DATA: Yes.

11:58.509 --> 12:01.886
If I am correct, the mercenary ship
is headed toward these coordinates

12:02.054 --> 12:03.596
in the Hyralan sector.

12:03.764 --> 12:06.850
Well, their maximum speed
is warp 8.7.

12:07.017 --> 12:10.520
It would take them at least 14 hours
to reach that position.

12:10.688 --> 12:11.980
We could be there in five.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.315
Make it so.

12:14.942 --> 12:15.984
Finally.

12:17.987 --> 12:21.322
Set a course for the Hyralan sector
and engage at warp 9.

12:21.490 --> 12:23.366
OFFICER:
Aye, sir.

12:23.534 --> 12:25.160
DATA:
Lieutenant.

12:25.995 --> 12:28.872
- May l see you in the Ready Room?
- Of course.

12:37.423 --> 12:40.300
Lieutenant, I am dissatisfied
with your performance as first officer.

12:40.468 --> 12:41.801
May I ask in what way?

12:41.969 --> 12:44.888
You continually question my orders
in front of the crew.

12:45.055 --> 12:46.848
I do not believe
this is appropriate behavior.

12:47.016 --> 12:48.808
With all due respect, sir,

12:48.976 --> 12:51.436
I have always felt free
to voice my opinions,

12:51.604 --> 12:54.355
even when they differ from those of
Captain Picard or Commander Riker.

12:54.523 --> 12:57.984
That is true, but in those situations,
you were acting as head of security,

12:58.152 --> 12:59.360
not as first officer.

12:59.528 --> 13:01.196
The primary role
of the second-in-command

13:01.363 --> 13:03.198
is to carry out the decisions
of the captain.

13:03.365 --> 13:05.575
In this case, me.

13:05.993 --> 13:10.371
But is it not my duty
to offer you alternatives?

13:10.539 --> 13:11.581
Yes.

13:11.749 --> 13:14.459
But once I have made a decision,
it is your job to carry it out,

13:14.627 --> 13:17.170
regardless of how
you may personally feel.

13:17.338 --> 13:19.547
Any further objections
should be given to me in private,

13:19.715 --> 13:20.965
not in front of the crew.

13:21.133 --> 13:22.509
I do not recall Commander Riker

13:22.676 --> 13:26.596
ever publicly showing irritation with
his captain as you did a moment ago.

13:29.016 --> 13:30.225
No, sir.

13:30.392 --> 13:32.519
If you do not feel capable
of carrying out this role,

13:32.686 --> 13:34.145
I will assign it
to Commander La Forge

13:34.313 --> 13:35.855
and return you to tactical.

13:36.023 --> 13:39.025
I would not enter it
into your record as a reprimand,

13:39.193 --> 13:40.360
simply as a transfer.

13:42.029 --> 13:44.781
I would prefer to remain
at my current post.

13:45.199 --> 13:48.451
Then I expect you to conform
to the guidelines I have laid out.

13:48.994 --> 13:50.078
Aye, sir.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.538
Dismissed.

13:52.790 --> 13:54.415
Mr. Worf.

13:56.085 --> 13:58.670
I am sorry
if I have ended our friendship.

14:00.339 --> 14:06.928
Sir, it is l who has jeopardized
our friendship, not you.

14:08.055 --> 14:09.931
If you will overlook this incident,

14:10.099 --> 14:12.976
I would like to continue
to consider you my friend.

14:13.936 --> 14:15.562
I would like that as well.

14:16.021 --> 14:17.605
Thank you, sir.

14:33.247 --> 14:35.206
Good to see you too.

14:39.545 --> 14:44.090
I've had some unpleasant surprises.
Will, this isn't a good idea.

14:44.258 --> 14:45.592
Baran might grow suspicious.

14:45.759 --> 14:48.469
As a matter of fact,
it was Baran who sent me here.

14:48.637 --> 14:51.180
He told me to pretend
to be friendly with you,

14:51.348 --> 14:53.099
help you organize a mutiny

14:53.267 --> 14:56.561
so that he can determine
who your supporters are in the crew,

14:56.729 --> 14:58.479
and then eliminate them.

14:58.647 --> 15:01.316
Oh, what a tangled web we weave.

15:01.483 --> 15:04.027
I have difficulty remembering
whose side I'm on.

15:04.194 --> 15:05.945
So, what have you been able
to find out?

15:06.113 --> 15:07.822
When we reach the Hyralan sector,

15:07.990 --> 15:10.825
we're supposed to rendezvous
with a Klingon transport ship.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.035
I'm not sure,

15:12.202 --> 15:15.288
but I think they may be delivering
another of the Romulan artifacts to us.

15:15.456 --> 15:16.664
A second artifact?

15:16.832 --> 15:19.918
Oh, by the way,
that first artifact is not Romulan.

15:20.085 --> 15:21.961
- It's Vulcan.
- Vulcan?

15:22.129 --> 15:26.007
Mm-hm. l have been looking over
the glyphs and pictograms

15:26.175 --> 15:28.301
from the Calder II artifact.

15:28.469 --> 15:32.180
And although I don't have enough data
to translate all the inscriptions,

15:32.348 --> 15:35.934
the alphabet and the symbology
is much more consistent

15:36.101 --> 15:38.561
with early Vulcan than Romulan.

15:41.190 --> 15:44.525
Do these artifacts have some religious
or cultural significance?

15:44.693 --> 15:47.278
Something that would make them
valuable enough to kill for?

15:47.863 --> 15:49.530
I don't know.

15:53.243 --> 15:55.411
If I could just get access

15:55.579 --> 15:58.039
to the Enterprise computer
just for a few moments.

16:01.502 --> 16:06.381
So, what will Baran do once
he's obtained the second artifact?

16:06.548 --> 16:08.716
You're supposed to verify
its authenticity,

16:08.884 --> 16:10.760
then I'm supposed to kill you.

16:10.928 --> 16:12.220
Then I take your place.

16:13.222 --> 16:15.848
Will, you always seem
to be after my job.

16:16.892 --> 16:19.769
Well, as soon as Baran feels
that I've outlived my usefulness,

16:19.937 --> 16:23.731
he can kill me
simply by using the neural servo.

16:23.899 --> 16:27.819
So I think we had better
start planning a mutiny.

16:31.281 --> 16:32.865
We need a new captain.

16:33.033 --> 16:35.034
And I've come to one
inescapable conclusion.

16:35.202 --> 16:38.246
I agree. But I don't think that's you.

16:38.414 --> 16:41.040
- Oh?
- I don't trust you, Galen.

16:41.208 --> 16:43.209
And I don't think
the rest of the crew does either.

16:43.377 --> 16:47.380
- They're not gonna follow you.
- Then who will they follow? You?

16:47.548 --> 16:52.218
No, but they will follow Tallera,
and so will I.

16:58.767 --> 17:00.893
- Who are you?
- What?

17:01.061 --> 17:04.439
You're no smuggler,
and I don't think your name is Galen.

17:06.191 --> 17:09.485
You will tell me who you really are
and what you are doing on this ship,

17:09.653 --> 17:11.696
or I will kill you right here.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.537
What are you talking about?

17:19.705 --> 17:22.290
I will not play games with you.

17:22.458 --> 17:25.710
I found the message
you sent to the Enterprise.

17:25.878 --> 17:28.963
When Riker was using his
command codes to drop their shields,

17:29.131 --> 17:31.883
you sent them a transmission
on the same carrier wave.

17:32.509 --> 17:37.055
You're a Starfleet officer.
Do not deny it.

17:37.222 --> 17:39.640
It is the only logical conclusion.

17:42.186 --> 17:46.105
My name is actually T'Paal,
and I am a member of the V'Shar.

17:46.857 --> 17:50.234
- Vulcan security?
- That is correct.

17:51.737 --> 17:56.491
I infiltrated this ship a year ago,
posing as a Romulan mercenary.

17:56.658 --> 18:00.078
I'm here to investigate
a possible threat to Vulcan.

18:00.245 --> 18:02.246
What sort of threat?

18:02.414 --> 18:05.958
First things first, Galen.
Who are you?

18:07.461 --> 18:10.171
I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard
of the Enterprise.

18:12.174 --> 18:13.966
Very well.

18:14.134 --> 18:16.677
To answer your question,
for several years now,

18:16.845 --> 18:18.679
there has been a small
but growing movement

18:18.847 --> 18:21.349
of extreme isolationists on Vulcan.

18:21.517 --> 18:24.936
A group that believes
contact with alien races

18:25.104 --> 18:29.482
has polluted our culture
and is destroying Vulcan purity.

18:29.650 --> 18:34.028
This group advocates the total isolation
of Vulcan from the rest of the galaxy

18:34.196 --> 18:38.032
and the eradication
of all alien influences from our planet.

18:38.200 --> 18:41.536
That sounds
like an illogical philosophy.

18:41.995 --> 18:43.412
Agreed.

18:43.580 --> 18:47.333
But extremists
often have a logic all their own.

18:47.501 --> 18:48.668
Tell me, Tallera,

18:48.836 --> 18:51.671
what are these artifacts
that we've been collecting?

18:51.839 --> 18:54.841
I know that they are Vulcan in origin.

18:55.008 --> 18:58.928
I'm sure you are familiar
with the ancient history of my people

18:59.096 --> 19:03.474
before we found logic,
before we found peace.

19:03.642 --> 19:07.520
You were much as my people
once were. Savage, warlike.

19:07.688 --> 19:13.234
There was even a time when we used
our telepathic abilities as a weapon.

19:13.402 --> 19:17.029
A time when we learned
to kill with a thought.

19:17.573 --> 19:19.073
The Stone of Gol.

19:20.033 --> 19:21.075
You know of it?

19:21.743 --> 19:24.287
I know the story
from Vulcan mythology.

19:24.454 --> 19:26.581
The Stone of Gol is real,

19:26.748 --> 19:29.834
but there is nothing supernatural
or magical about it.

19:30.002 --> 19:32.253
It is a psionic resonator.

19:32.796 --> 19:36.841
A device which focuses
and amplifies telepathic energy.

19:37.301 --> 19:40.928
It is one of the most devastating
weapons ever conceived.

19:41.096 --> 19:44.140
But according to the legend,
the stone was destroyed by the gods

19:44.308 --> 19:46.350
when the Vulcan people
found their way to peace.

19:46.518 --> 19:48.978
The resonator was believed
to have been destroyed

19:49.146 --> 19:50.938
during the Time of the Awakening.

19:51.106 --> 19:53.649
Only one piece
is known to have survived,

19:53.817 --> 19:56.777
and it was placed in a Vulcan museum
under heavy guard.

19:56.945 --> 20:00.281
A year ago, that piece was stolen
from the museum.

20:00.449 --> 20:03.784
Soon after, mercenary ships
began raiding archaeological sites

20:03.952 --> 20:05.536
across the quadrant.

20:05.704 --> 20:08.623
We believe a member
of the isolationist movement

20:08.790 --> 20:11.918
is attempting
to reassemble the resonator.

20:12.085 --> 20:13.377
A telepathic weapon.

20:13.545 --> 20:17.548
My orders are to find that assassin
and stop him.

20:18.133 --> 20:19.717
It would seem that Baran

20:19.885 --> 20:24.972
has to deliver these artifacts
to the assassin in order to get paid.

20:25.140 --> 20:30.686
Therefore, you and I
should continue our masquerade.

20:31.188 --> 20:32.647
Agreed.

20:33.774 --> 20:38.110
But, captain, I cannot allow
the resonator to be assembled.

20:38.278 --> 20:43.282
If necessary,
I will destroy this ship, its crew,

20:43.450 --> 20:46.327
all of us
to prevent that from happening.

20:49.665 --> 20:54.585
DATA: Acting captain's log,
stardate 471 60.1 .

20:54.753 --> 20:57.088
The Enterprise is entering
the Hyralan sector,

20:57.256 --> 21:01.509
which l believe to be the next
destination of the mercenary ship.

21:03.011 --> 21:07.473
I am picking up a small vessel,
bearing 1 27 mark 335.

21:07.641 --> 21:11.519
- Is it the mercenary ship?
- No, sir. It's a Klingon ship.

21:12.771 --> 21:15.189
A Toron-class shuttlecraft,
one person.

21:15.357 --> 21:17.191
Open a channel.

21:18.443 --> 21:22.822
This is Lieutenant Commander Data
of the Federation starship Enterprise.

21:23.031 --> 21:24.407
Koral.

21:31.123 --> 21:32.623
I take it that is your name.

21:36.211 --> 21:39.005
May I inquire as to your destination?

21:39.798 --> 21:40.923
No.

21:41.967 --> 21:44.385
DATA:
May I ask the purpose of your journey?

21:44.553 --> 21:45.803
No.

21:46.972 --> 21:49.098
Perhaps l have not
made our intentions clear.

21:49.266 --> 21:50.308
We are investigating--

21:57.691 --> 22:01.068
He seems most uncooperative.

22:01.236 --> 22:03.904
He may have been curt,
but he was also very worried,

22:04.072 --> 22:06.073
and even a little scared.

22:06.241 --> 22:08.659
Sir, may l recommend

22:08.827 --> 22:11.162
that we bring the shuttlecraft aboard
with our tractor beam,

22:11.330 --> 22:13.414
search it and interrogate Koral?

22:15.000 --> 22:17.376
According to the terms
of the Klingon Federation Treaty,

22:17.544 --> 22:21.088
Koral has every right to free transit
through Federation space.

22:21.256 --> 22:24.550
We cannot board
or search his vessel without cause.

22:24.718 --> 22:26.260
Yes, sir.

22:27.262 --> 22:30.389
However, the treaty does give us
the right to conduct

22:30.557 --> 22:33.601
health and safety inspections
on any ship in our space.

22:33.769 --> 22:35.811
Health and safety inspections?

22:36.938 --> 22:40.316
I am not certain that using this clause
as an excuse to conduct a search

22:40.484 --> 22:44.320
would be consistent
with the spirit of the treaty.

22:46.823 --> 22:47.865
Yes, sir.

22:48.575 --> 22:54.372
However,
if Koral wishes to contest our actions,

22:54.831 --> 22:57.541
he can file a protest with
the judge advocate general's office.

22:57.709 --> 22:59.794
Bring the shuttle aboard.

22:59.961 --> 23:02.254
Then you and Dr. Crusher
may begin the inspection.

23:03.090 --> 23:04.131
Aye, sir.

23:26.530 --> 23:27.696
Hello.

23:27.864 --> 23:31.242
I'm Dr. Crusher
and this is Lieutenant Worf.

23:31.743 --> 23:35.496
We're here to conduct a health
and safety inspection of your ship.

23:35.664 --> 23:38.707
Health and safety inspection?

23:38.875 --> 23:42.920
That's right.
Uh, you know, uh, radiation leaks,

23:43.088 --> 23:49.718
um, biochemical contamination,
um, other health hazards.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.013
Excuse me.

24:04.734 --> 24:08.779
Well, no radiation so far.
I'm sure you're glad to hear that.

24:08.947 --> 24:10.489
Right.

24:12.117 --> 24:16.245
There's an incoming message.
It's from the Klingon shuttle.

24:16.413 --> 24:19.081
It was sent
approximately 1 5 minutes ago.

24:19.249 --> 24:20.749
He's at the rendezvous coordinates,

24:20.917 --> 24:22.751
but he's been detained
by the Enterprise.

24:22.919 --> 24:25.546
Well, that's all there is.
He stopped transmitting.

24:25.714 --> 24:27.381
The Enterprise.

24:27.549 --> 24:31.010
Now, how could they have found out
about the rendezvous, commander?

24:31.178 --> 24:32.386
BARAN:
Quiet.

24:32.554 --> 24:34.221
All that matters now
is that the Enterprise

24:34.389 --> 24:36.223
has the second artifact
in their possession.

24:37.184 --> 24:38.309
We don't have a choice.

24:38.477 --> 24:41.103
We'll have to board the Enterprise
and take the artifact.

24:41.938 --> 24:44.899
Do you have any idea
how many security officers

24:45.066 --> 24:47.902
there are onboard a ship like that?

24:48.069 --> 24:50.821
No, I don't, but he does.

24:53.700 --> 24:56.118
I could get us on the Enterprise.

24:56.578 --> 24:58.245
I can find the artifact.

24:58.413 --> 25:01.373
Oh, yeah. Very convenient.

25:01.541 --> 25:04.043
We beam you back
aboard your old ship,

25:04.211 --> 25:07.588
we have to take a risk that you
won't change your mind and betray us.

25:07.756 --> 25:11.258
I have saved your life
twice already, Galen.

25:12.010 --> 25:15.095
I would think you would begin
to show some gratitude by now.

25:15.263 --> 25:18.265
Galen,
if you're so worried about Riker,

25:18.433 --> 25:20.893
then you can go on
the raiding party and watch him.

25:22.646 --> 25:23.938
Agreed.

25:24.105 --> 25:28.108
Draw weapons and equipment
for a raiding party of five.

25:35.158 --> 25:39.119
If you're thinking of betraying us
to your friends on the Enterprise,

25:39.287 --> 25:42.206
you might remember
that I still have the ability to kill you

25:42.374 --> 25:44.750
at the first sign of trouble.

25:44.918 --> 25:46.210
I haven't forgotten.

25:46.378 --> 25:50.923
I have an additional task for you.
One that will prove your loyalty.

25:51.091 --> 25:54.760
This raid is an opportunity
to get rid of Galen.

25:54.928 --> 25:59.139
Once you've found that artifact,
kill him.

26:11.486 --> 26:13.320
TROI: l'm sure the health
and safety inspection

26:13.488 --> 26:14.947
won't last much longer.

26:15.115 --> 26:16.156
And in the meantime,

26:16.324 --> 26:19.827
I'm really glad that we have
this opportunity to get to know you.

26:19.995 --> 26:22.997
May I ask what business you're in?

26:27.419 --> 26:30.129
Lieutenant Worf
has programmed our replicators

26:30.297 --> 26:35.301
to make a very good approximation
of Klingon bloodwine.

26:35.468 --> 26:38.762
I believe you will find it to your liking.

26:55.864 --> 26:58.907
That's my third scan, and I still haven't
found anything out of the ordinary.

26:59.075 --> 27:01.368
He must be hiding something.

27:02.370 --> 27:04.788
We should download
his computer memory and analyze it.

27:04.956 --> 27:08.292
I'd have a hard time defending
that as part of a safety inspection.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.002
We could claim that the computer

27:10.170 --> 27:12.463
was generating
abnormal radiation signatures.

27:12.631 --> 27:15.257
Worf, we're on pretty shaky ground
as it is. We can't just--

27:20.055 --> 27:23.057
- Don't.
- Watch that door.

27:23.892 --> 27:26.435
- What is going on?
- Shut your mouth, Klingon.

27:26.603 --> 27:28.604
I guess you're surprised to see me,
doctor.

27:28.772 --> 27:29.897
You could say that.

27:30.065 --> 27:32.232
I've had a change of profession.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.735
It's not in here. Hey, you.

27:35.236 --> 27:36.904
Where's the artifact?

27:37.072 --> 27:38.739
I do not know
what you're talking about.

27:38.907 --> 27:42.284
Use your brain. They wouldn't be
searching if they had the artifact.

27:42.452 --> 27:46.121
Koral must have it.
Where is that Klingon pilot?

27:47.582 --> 27:50.084
In the observation lounge
with Data and Troi.

27:50.251 --> 27:52.711
- How far?
- Twelve decks away.

27:52.879 --> 27:54.588
Security will not allow you
to get that far.

27:54.756 --> 27:56.090
RlKER:
They won't get the chance.

27:56.549 --> 27:58.175
We'll use the transporter
in that shuttle,

27:58.343 --> 28:00.511
we'll beam directly
to the observation lounge.

28:00.679 --> 28:02.429
Sorry about this.

28:07.477 --> 28:09.019
Let's go.

28:13.942 --> 28:19.738
If you could tell us something
about the nature of your mission...

28:19.906 --> 28:20.948
[TRANSPORTER ENERGIZlNG]

28:27.914 --> 28:29.832
- What is this?
RlKER: Quiet.

I'm sorry,

34:23.478 --> 34:25.854
Oh, I wonder if you can possibly
help me with something.

34:26.022 --> 34:27.439
I have been able to translate

34:27.607 --> 34:29.900
most of the writings
on these two pieces.

34:30.068 --> 34:33.028
For the most part, they're warnings
of death and destruction

34:33.196 --> 34:35.197
to anyone
who opposes the resonator.

34:35.364 --> 34:36.865
But...

34:37.617 --> 34:43.622
...I am not able to determine
what appears on the anterior side.

34:43.790 --> 34:47.167
For example, this symbol
represents the Vulcan god of war,

34:47.335 --> 34:48.960
and this the god of death.

34:49.128 --> 34:55.592
But if you look really carefully,
you can see a third symbol is missing.

34:55.760 --> 35:00.097
Now, that obviously
should belong to the final piece.

35:00.264 --> 35:03.809
Now, what's odd about this
is that the god of death and war

35:03.976 --> 35:06.895
would typically always
stand alone on an artifact.

35:07.063 --> 35:09.231
They'd never be combined
with a third glyph.

35:09.398 --> 35:13.360
Fascinating,
but I am not an archaeological expert.

35:13.528 --> 35:15.904
I'm really anxious to see
the final artifact,

35:16.072 --> 35:20.283
because it might provide a valuable
insight into Vulcan mythology.

35:21.035 --> 35:23.120
When we arrive at Vulcan,

35:23.287 --> 35:26.498
I will take these pieces
to a secure holding area

35:26.666 --> 35:29.209
before going on to the sanctuary.

35:29.377 --> 35:31.545
I prefer to go alone.

35:31.712 --> 35:35.799
It will arouse less suspicion
on the part of the isolationists.

35:35.967 --> 35:38.760
Well, there should be no problem
about our entering orbit.

35:38.928 --> 35:41.721
I asked Commander Riker
to contact the Vulcan authorities

35:41.889 --> 35:46.226
from the Enterprise, let them know
that we were approaching.

35:47.186 --> 35:48.895
Why did you do that?

35:49.063 --> 35:52.899
Well, I didn't want to risk
a misunderstanding.

35:53.484 --> 35:57.904
Someone might have mistaken this
for an actual raid.

35:58.072 --> 36:00.615
It was a wise precaution.

36:02.952 --> 36:06.246
Perhaps l should contact
the Enterprise,

36:06.789 --> 36:08.415
have them meet us at Vulcan

36:08.583 --> 36:12.127
just in case these isolationists
try to escape.

36:12.295 --> 36:14.462
Your offer is appreciated,

36:14.630 --> 36:16.923
but our security forces
are more than adequate.

36:17.925 --> 36:20.510

36:21.637 --> 36:24.723
Do you think it's wise for you
to go there alone?

36:24.891 --> 36:28.310
After all,
they were expecting Baran to show up.

36:28.477 --> 36:30.353
Now, don't you think
if I were to accompany you,

36:30.521 --> 36:31.938
it might seem more plausible?

36:32.106 --> 36:35.442
Captain, l do understand
your human emotional need

36:35.610 --> 36:40.447
to be there at the final moment,
but this is a Vulcan matter.

Of course.

but it's safer for all concerned
to leave one behind.

They will not pay us
until they get both pieces.

37:17.777 --> 37:19.402
They've been waiting
a long time for this.

37:19.570 --> 37:21.446
They're not gonna take any risks.

37:21.614 --> 37:24.157
Now, take one of the artifacts
and beam down.

37:25.493 --> 37:27.661
That is all I was waiting for.

37:27.828 --> 37:32.207
Go to the navigational computer
and check file 1 37-slash-omega.

37:32.375 --> 37:35.418
You'll find a message secretly
transmitted to the Enterprise

37:35.586 --> 37:37.921

37:39.590 --> 37:40.966
She's right.

37:41.133 --> 37:45.762
The message was sent by Galen.
He's a Starfleet officer.

37:47.348 --> 37:49.391
Tallera is right.

37:50.142 --> 37:54.104
But what she's not telling you
is that those artifacts she's holding

37:54.272 --> 37:57.023
are part of an incredibly
powerful weapon.

37:57.942 --> 38:00.860
There's no reward waiting for you
down on the surface.

38:01.028 --> 38:03.530
As soon as she's got those artifacts,

38:03.698 --> 38:06.574
she'll leave you behind
to be captured by Starfleet.

38:07.535 --> 38:09.286
I don't care what it is you want,
Tallera.

38:09.996 --> 38:12.372
I don't care if it's a weapon
for your personal use

38:12.540 --> 38:15.125
or if you're really just making
a delivery as planned.

38:15.293 --> 38:17.043
All l care about is my money.

38:17.753 --> 38:19.546
So I propose a compromise.

38:19.714 --> 38:21.381

to the surface

that we receive our payment.

38:23.926 --> 38:27.053
After that,

Don't make
any aggressive movements.

40:33.180 --> 40:37.475
The resonator amplifies
violent feelings and emotions.

40:38.436 --> 40:40.687
And that's why you wanted me
to pick up the phaser.

40:40.855 --> 40:43.648
That's how you were able
to kill Narik and Vekor.

40:43.816 --> 40:49.028
But l can see the symbol
on that third artifact.

And it is the Vulcan symbol
for peace

40:52.408 --> 40:56.411
standing between the symbols
for war and death.

It's a warning

that the power of the resonator
can be overcome by peace.

Two thousand years ago,

your people
were being consumed by war.

41:28.903 --> 41:34.073
But when peace came to Vulcan,
the resonator became useless.

41:34.241 --> 41:36.409
That's why it was dismantled.

41:58.766 --> 42:00.141
You were right, Tallera.

42:00.309 --> 42:04.979
The resonator cannot be stopped
by phasers and shields.

42:05.189 --> 42:08.274
But it can be defeated by peace.

43:26.020 --> 43:29.397
You've been declared dead.
You can't give orders around here.

43:30.816 --> 43:33.776
If we are to adhere to the exact letter
of Starfleet regulations,

43:33.944 --> 43:37.488
then, technically, sir,
you have been declared a renegade.

43:37.656 --> 43:42.410
In fact, I believe you are facing
1 2 counts of court-martial offenses.

43:42.578 --> 43:44.370
You cannot give orders either, sir.

43:44.538 --> 43:46.289
That's quite right.

43:46.457 --> 43:50.710
And as I'm supposed to be dead,
I'll go and get some sleep.

43:50.878 --> 43:54.589
And, Mr. Data, l suggest that you
escort Commander Riker to the brig.

43:54.757 --> 43:56.299
Aye, sir.

43:59.887 --> 44:01.554
This way, sir.

44:03.057 --> 44:05.058
Data, he was joking.

44:06.268 --> 44:08.269
You know that, right?

44:08.437 --> 44:09.979
Data?
