<i>Previously on</i> The Affair...

00:09.269 --> 00:12.103
<i>I feel a little weird
being here without you.</i>

00:12.105 --> 00:14.572
- Why?
- What do they think about me?

00:14.574 --> 00:16.041
Yvonne has been looking
for a personal assistant.

00:16.043 --> 00:17.709
I just thought since you're here

00:17.711 --> 00:20.011
and you seem kind of bored
and we get along so well...

00:20.013 --> 00:21.445
I'll take it.

00:21.447 --> 00:23.048
How much of this
is based on what happened

00:23.050 --> 00:25.383
between you and, um,
what's her actual name?

00:25.385 --> 00:26.617
<i>How's the book
coming along?</i>

00:26.619 --> 00:28.753
- Have you read it?
- Not yet.

00:28.755 --> 00:30.888
<i>Noah doesn't like to share
his work until it's finished.</i>

00:30.890 --> 00:32.222
I'd love to read it
when you want an opinion.

00:32.223 --> 00:33.857
<i>I wouldn't tell Alison.</i>

00:33.859 --> 00:36.160
It's a very bad idea
to mix love and criticism.

00:36.162 --> 00:40.597
I'm going to issue a court order
preventing Ms. Bailey

00:40.599 --> 00:43.033
from any contact
with the four children.

00:43.035 --> 00:44.434
I'm really sorry.

00:44.436 --> 00:46.403
I don't think
we can live together.

00:48.708 --> 00:49.840
Niño.

00:49.842 --> 00:51.041
I can't believe I just did that.

00:51.043 --> 00:53.243
- I'm Cole, by the way.
- Luisa.

00:53.245 --> 00:55.012
What's going on
with the house?

00:55.014 --> 00:57.180
- What?
- Is she selling?

00:57.182 --> 00:59.015
I have no idea.

00:59.017 --> 01:00.250
Because you're sitting on
a lot of money there, brother.

01:00.252 --> 01:02.686
That's my card.

01:02.688 --> 01:05.355
I'm very discreet.

01:05.357 --> 01:06.756
What's the worst thing
you've ever done?

01:06.758 --> 01:08.391
This, probably.

01:08.393 --> 01:11.294
How about you?

01:11.296 --> 01:14.397
I've done a lot of things.

Mm.

03:15.883 --> 03:17.917
Hey, it's me.

03:17.919 --> 03:21.854
I just wanted to check in,
see how Martin's doing.

03:21.856 --> 03:25.924
I... and, um, I'm wondering
what you're doing today.

03:25.926 --> 03:27.560
I'm not sure what the plan is.

03:27.562 --> 03:30.062
Am I staying here?

03:30.064 --> 03:32.431
Are you coming back?

03:32.433 --> 03:34.700
Uh, can you just call me?

03:34.702 --> 03:37.436
Okay. Love you.

03:46.779 --> 03:48.747
Oh, shit.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.968
Oh, Jesus Christ, you can't just
sneak up on me like that.

04:10.970 --> 04:12.270
Oh, I-I'm sorry.

04:12.272 --> 04:13.504
I just wanted to bring
your coffee.

04:13.506 --> 04:15.606
- Is it decaf?
- Of course.

04:15.608 --> 04:18.309
All right,
just put it over there.

04:18.310 --> 04:20.644
I didn't mean to scare you.

04:23.615 --> 04:26.816
Won't you be chilly
in those things?

04:26.818 --> 04:29.752
Uh, it's going to be 90 today.

04:29.754 --> 04:33.256
Well, it's not now.

04:33.258 --> 04:35.658
All of these
need letters of rejection.

04:35.660 --> 04:38.028
Just use the template
my last assistant put together.

04:38.030 --> 04:41.131
It's somewhere on the laptop.
You'll have to find it.

04:41.133 --> 04:42.933
And then just go ahead
and sign for me.

04:42.935 --> 04:45.168
- You can do that?
- Uh, yeah. Sure, no problem.

04:45.170 --> 04:46.502
Maybe you want
to write this down.

04:46.504 --> 04:49.204
Uh, yeah.

04:49.206 --> 04:51.808
Just get one off the desk.

04:54.177 --> 04:55.611
Um...

04:55.613 --> 04:57.547
Take a piece of paper
from the printer.

05:02.519 --> 05:04.353
Okay, whenever you're ready.

05:04.355 --> 05:06.756
All right,
this has to go overnight.

05:06.758 --> 05:09.190
Be sure you get everything
to the post office this morning,

05:09.192 --> 05:11.259
and then,
while you're in town,

05:11.261 --> 05:14.429
run by Hudson Hil's
and pick up lunch for four.

05:14.431 --> 05:17.566
Just choose
from the catering menu for us.

05:17.568 --> 05:21.603
Put it all on the card, plus
something for a three-year-old.

05:21.605 --> 05:23.705
Or I suppose you'll have
to pick up hot dogs and buns.

05:23.707 --> 05:27.542
That's all she feeds him...
my daughter.

05:27.544 --> 05:29.878
We didn't tell you...
my daughter and her husband

05:29.880 --> 05:32.013
are coming up
for the holiday weekend.

05:32.015 --> 05:35.817
Oh, well, uh, just let me know
of any way I can help.

05:35.819 --> 05:37.651
I am.

05:39.154 --> 05:41.856
Right.

05:41.858 --> 05:44.725
Oh, uh,
what about Robert's exercises?

05:44.727 --> 05:46.394
What about them?

05:46.396 --> 05:48.729
I should run through them
with him, shouldn't I?

05:48.731 --> 05:51.932
Not necessary. I have convinced
Hugo to come back next week.

05:54.236 --> 05:56.004
Oh.

05:56.006 --> 05:59.773
Uh, well, he needs to work
that knee every day. I...

06:00.909 --> 06:02.110
Fine.

06:06.814 --> 06:10.217
Is that Noah's book
you were reading?

06:10.219 --> 06:12.252
Yes.

06:12.254 --> 06:15.055
How is it?

06:15.057 --> 06:16.523
It's fascinating.

06:19.427 --> 06:20.593
Door closed.

06:38.412 --> 06:39.712
Alison.

06:39.714 --> 06:42.481
Oh. I'm sorry.

06:42.483 --> 06:45.051
- I did 500. I'm done.
- Right.

06:45.053 --> 06:46.953
Well, you should've
been counting. What's next?

06:46.955 --> 06:50.623
Ah, uh,
let's do some leg lifts, mm?

06:50.625 --> 06:52.091
- Keep the hip down.
- I know.

06:52.093 --> 06:54.660
Okay. That's it.

06:54.662 --> 06:55.761
Mm.

06:58.298 --> 06:59.731
Okay.

06:59.733 --> 07:02.834
Don't let anybody fool you
into getting old.

07:02.836 --> 07:05.137
They wax on and on
about how satisfying it is.

07:05.139 --> 07:06.638
You know what's
really satisfying?

07:06.640 --> 07:07.806
Cartilage.

07:10.177 --> 07:11.843
I'm trying to make you laugh,
kid.

07:11.845 --> 07:14.646
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm just a little distracted.

07:14.648 --> 07:17.183
Something wrong?

07:17.185 --> 07:20.218
I don't know.

07:20.220 --> 07:22.454
Is Yvonne mad at me
for some reason?

07:22.456 --> 07:25.057
Not that I know of.
Why?

07:25.059 --> 07:28.827
I, uh...
I just took her her coffee,

07:28.829 --> 07:30.862
and she was reading Noah's book,
and she just...

07:30.864 --> 07:33.999
Ah, well,
"reading" is a polite word.

07:34.001 --> 07:36.468
She's been devouring it.

07:40.640 --> 07:43.541
Um, that's ten.
You take a rest.

07:43.543 --> 07:45.042
Okay.

07:45.044 --> 07:46.944
I'll work on your thigh,
so you don't cramp.

07:46.946 --> 07:49.279
- Okay.
- Okay.

07:49.281 --> 07:51.381
Mm.

07:51.383 --> 07:53.050
Have you read it?

07:53.052 --> 07:57.254
She's read some passages aloud
to me in bed.

07:59.958 --> 08:03.360
He's an incredibly strong
writer, isn't he?

08:03.362 --> 08:06.463
Uh, well, I wouldn't know.

08:06.465 --> 08:08.733
He won't let me read it.

08:08.735 --> 08:10.735
Huh.

08:10.737 --> 08:12.736
Well, he probably just wants
to make it perfect

08:12.738 --> 08:15.071
before he shows it to you.

08:15.073 --> 08:18.474
Yeah, maybe.

08:24.915 --> 08:27.250
How is Noah?

08:27.252 --> 08:29.385
Uh, yeah, yeah, he's...
he's fine.

08:29.387 --> 08:30.720
Is... is he here?

08:30.722 --> 08:32.255
I haven't seen him
in the past few days.

08:32.256 --> 08:35.025
Uh, no, he's in the city.
His son is sick.

08:35.027 --> 08:39.095
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Serious?

08:39.097 --> 08:42.431
He doesn't know yet.

08:42.433 --> 08:44.267
Well, do you want
to go be with him?

08:44.269 --> 08:45.768
We can manage here
without you.

08:45.770 --> 08:49.472
No, no,
that's very nice of you, but...

08:49.474 --> 08:53.276
uh, she doesn't want me there.

08:53.278 --> 08:55.278
Oh.

08:55.280 --> 08:57.246
Yeah, the early years
of a second marriage.

08:57.248 --> 08:59.048
I remember them well.

08:59.050 --> 09:01.517
You couldn't pay me
to go back there.

09:05.289 --> 09:06.855
- Okay.
- What?

09:06.857 --> 09:08.523
Time for the second set.

09:08.525 --> 09:10.759
- You scared me.
- Hip down.

09:13.597 --> 09:15.263
Go.

09:15.265 --> 09:16.965
Oh, this one's harder
than the last one.

09:16.967 --> 09:20.335
I know, I know.
Keep going.

09:20.337 --> 09:22.838
Mm.

09:22.840 --> 09:24.707
How did you and Yvonne meet?

09:27.911 --> 09:30.112
She was my wife's friend.

09:32.415 --> 09:35.282
- Oh.
- Yeah.

09:35.284 --> 09:39.286
It caused something
of a scandal, to put it mildly.

09:39.288 --> 09:41.388
What... did you have an affair?

09:44.292 --> 09:45.760
We did.

09:48.363 --> 09:49.831
Ah.

09:49.833 --> 09:52.033
Is that so hard
for you to fathom?

09:52.035 --> 09:55.502
No. No, of course not.
I just... I just, um...

09:55.504 --> 09:59.107
It was painful,
but eventually,

09:59.109 --> 10:00.641
things worked out
for Yvonne and me,

10:00.643 --> 10:04.244
and they're going to work out
for you and Noah too.

10:04.246 --> 10:05.846
Well, we...

10:05.848 --> 10:07.848
I always suspected
there was something

10:07.850 --> 10:10.350
a little more to the story about
the lighthouse in the rain.

10:13.621 --> 10:17.090
Like maybe spouses?

10:17.092 --> 10:19.626
Am I right?

10:21.296 --> 10:23.329
What's that face?
Don't do that.

10:23.331 --> 10:25.632
You have nothing
to be ashamed of.

10:25.634 --> 10:27.333
You didn't kill anyone.

10:27.335 --> 10:30.269
You're young, you're beautiful,
and you fell in love.

10:30.271 --> 10:34.473
There's nothing criminal
about that.

10:35.843 --> 10:40.179
It was insane
the way it happened, Robert.

10:40.181 --> 10:43.649
Now, I met him,
and he said he was married,

10:43.651 --> 10:47.920
and I was married,
so I thought, "Well, good.

10:47.922 --> 10:49.454
This is safe.
We can just be friends."

10:49.456 --> 10:51.257
Yeah.

10:51.259 --> 10:53.826
And then we were walking home
one night, and he kissed me,

10:53.828 --> 10:55.961
just on the cheek, and...

10:55.963 --> 10:58.430
God, I felt this bolt of
electricity course through me.

11:01.100 --> 11:04.936
And I realized,
fuck, no.

11:04.938 --> 11:07.138
No, we can't.

11:09.809 --> 11:13.011
I-I tried to stay away
from him,

11:13.013 --> 11:14.012
but he was everywhere.

11:14.014 --> 11:17.182
It's a tiny town.

11:17.184 --> 11:20.885
And then, that one night,

11:20.887 --> 11:24.088
he kissed me on the beach,
and...

11:24.090 --> 11:28.359
it was the first time
in my life I...

11:28.361 --> 11:31.261
I couldn't say no.

11:32.932 --> 11:36.233
And all I could think about
was being close to him,

11:36.235 --> 11:38.268
touching him,
being naked with him,

11:38.270 --> 11:41.872
getting away from everything
in my life, and...

11:41.874 --> 11:44.975
it was terrifying.

11:44.977 --> 11:48.746
But... it was wonderful.

11:48.748 --> 11:52.416
I-I felt like
I'd been asleep for years,

11:52.418 --> 11:55.852
in this fog of grief,
and then there's this person

11:55.854 --> 12:00.056
who makes me feel alive,
and it...

12:05.095 --> 12:07.764
Anyway...

12:07.766 --> 12:11.267
Hey, uh, kid.

12:11.269 --> 12:14.371
I think, uh, we're done.

12:17.575 --> 12:19.108
Oh, uh...

12:19.110 --> 12:21.377
- It's okay, uh...
- No, it's fine.

12:25.148 --> 12:29.752
I guess you just have
this effect on men.

13:46.827 --> 13:48.161
Oh, you're one
of the lovebirds

13:48.163 --> 13:49.795
staying up
with Robert and Yvonne.

13:49.797 --> 13:52.165
I'm sorry?

13:52.167 --> 13:53.532
Yvonne told me
all about you.

13:53.534 --> 13:55.534
Show me the ring.

14:01.108 --> 14:02.508
Yvonne said there might be
wedding bells

14:02.510 --> 14:04.409
up at the property.

14:04.411 --> 14:05.910
She told you that?

14:05.912 --> 14:07.712
Couple of days ago.

14:07.714 --> 14:10.282
Congratulations.

14:10.284 --> 14:12.650
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

14:40.078 --> 14:43.513
No, no, no, not that platter.
That's decorative.

14:43.515 --> 14:45.448
Maybe get down
the wineglasses.

14:49.553 --> 14:52.188
No, no.
Those are the Pinot glasses.

14:52.190 --> 14:54.124
The small Chardonnay,
right?

14:57.396 --> 14:59.295
- Napkin in the lap.
- Put it in your lap, buddy.

14:59.297 --> 15:00.730
We're gonna eat
some dinner first, aren't we?

15:00.732 --> 15:03.632
- Huh? Yeah.
- Oh, no, no, no.

15:03.634 --> 15:05.934
That's lovely.
Thank you, Alison.

15:05.936 --> 15:08.003
Oh, so, Yvonne, I saw
your old intern Mark on Bowery.

15:08.005 --> 15:09.604
- Mama, I want a hot dog.
- Mark! I didn't know.

15:09.606 --> 15:11.440
- How is he?
- You want a hot dog? Mom?

15:11.442 --> 15:13.142
You want a hot dog, sweetie?
Okay, I'll get one for you.

15:13.144 --> 15:14.576
Alison. Alison.

15:14.578 --> 15:16.145
I don't see the hot dogs.

15:16.147 --> 15:18.613
Right, hot dogs.
I'll be right back.

15:26.455 --> 15:29.524
Show me your Superman.

15:29.526 --> 15:30.525
Oh!

15:30.527 --> 15:31.792
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

15:31.794 --> 15:32.793
Look at that.
He's got... oh!

15:56.184 --> 15:57.584
Hey, busy?

15:57.586 --> 16:00.554
No, not at all.

16:00.556 --> 16:02.021
Wow.

16:02.023 --> 16:04.756
I haven't actually been
inside here in years.

16:04.758 --> 16:06.959
It's Yvonne's domain.

16:06.961 --> 16:09.695
For her and her acolytes.

16:09.697 --> 16:12.198
Is everything okay
at the house?

16:12.200 --> 16:15.000
Is there anything I can do
to help?

16:15.002 --> 16:17.536
Listen, Alison.

16:17.538 --> 16:19.004
Uh, Yvonne's had a...

16:19.006 --> 16:23.308
just a really great phone call
from this young man

16:23.310 --> 16:25.978
who's just graduated from
the Iowa Writers' Workshop,

16:25.980 --> 16:28.847
and he's apparently
something really special.

16:28.849 --> 16:31.149
He's a really terrific
young man.

16:31.151 --> 16:33.051
Okay.

16:33.053 --> 16:36.855
Just the type of person
that Yvonne wants to mentor.

16:36.857 --> 16:39.691
And she really thinks that she...

16:39.693 --> 16:43.628
well, she can show him
a lot if, uh,

16:43.630 --> 16:45.796
he were to be her assistant.

16:48.567 --> 16:51.369
Um, uh...

16:51.371 --> 16:53.171
And, um,

16:53.173 --> 16:57.175
with Hugo coming back Tuesday,
we just really...

16:57.177 --> 17:00.512
we thought, uh, we'd...
we'd spare you the pressure

17:00.514 --> 17:03.748
of feeling like you need
to come up to the house anymore.

17:03.750 --> 17:06.316
Give you your time back.

17:06.318 --> 17:09.419
I'm... I'm not sure
I understand.

17:09.421 --> 17:11.656
Yvonne just wants
to work with someone

17:11.657 --> 17:13.790
a little more professional,
that's all.

17:15.060 --> 17:18.795
But I am professional.

17:18.797 --> 17:20.464
Well, I mean, let's face it.

17:20.465 --> 17:23.967
You care about her business
about as much as I do.

17:23.969 --> 17:27.604
Is this about what happened
in the living room?

17:27.606 --> 17:29.706
- No.
- Robert...

17:29.708 --> 17:33.410
Oh, please don't make this
into something it's not.

17:33.412 --> 17:36.613
I just...
I just don't understand. I...

17:36.615 --> 17:40.216
I think you do.

17:40.218 --> 17:43.452
Anyway, um,
I just wanted to let you know

17:43.454 --> 17:46.489
I'm so appreciative
of your help, as is Yvonne,

17:46.491 --> 17:50.259
and we know that you and Noah
will keep in touch with us

17:50.261 --> 17:52.195
when you go.

18:02.873 --> 18:05.641
You were never meant to be
someone's assistant, kid.

18:25.262 --> 18:26.928
Yvonne?

18:30.766 --> 18:32.234
Yvonne?

18:33.836 --> 18:36.938
I think there's been
a terrible misunderstanding.

19:16.711 --> 19:18.545
<i>At last,
he'd found solace.</i>

19:18.547 --> 19:20.414
<i>Out here he could breathe.</i>

19:20.416 --> 19:24.752
<i>The rustling of the dune grass,
the salt breeze.</i>

19:24.754 --> 19:26.787
<i>Or he would go back,
he thought, to the diner,</i>

19:26.789 --> 19:30.557
<i>to thank her,
leave his number.</i>

19:30.559 --> 19:32.926
<i>It was her.
What would he say?</i>

19:32.928 --> 19:34.395
<i>Would she remember him?</i>

19:34.397 --> 19:37.498
<i>His voice felt lost
in his throat.</i>

19:37.500 --> 19:39.400
<i>...lifted her skirt
just an inch.</i>

19:39.402 --> 19:41.201
<i>He paused.</i>

19:41.203 --> 19:43.537
<i>They listened together
to the sounds of the marina,</i>

19:43.539 --> 19:45.606
<i>hearts shaking in their skin.</i>

19:45.608 --> 19:49.609
<i>She was sex,
the very definition of it.</i>

19:49.611 --> 19:51.844
<i>She was the reason
the word was invented.</i>

19:55.215 --> 19:58.083
<i>...a fistful of her hair,
her head pulled back.</i>

19:58.085 --> 19:59.719
<i>Dress clinging to her back.</i>

19:59.721 --> 20:01.521
<i>Nails rasped
against the skin of his back.</i>

20:01.523 --> 20:03.323
<i>"Do you like my pussy?"
she asked.</i>

20:03.325 --> 20:04.857
<i>...tasted like metal...
two fingers...</i>

20:04.859 --> 20:06.559
<i>Desperately tight,
he came immediately.</i>

20:06.561 --> 20:08.328
<i>...felt her rigid
against him...</i>

20:08.330 --> 20:09.762
<i>...see the tip of her tongue
in her open mouth...</i>

20:09.764 --> 20:11.564
<i>...took him deep
into her mouth...</i>

20:11.566 --> 20:13.699
<i>...harder, breasts smashed
against the car window,</i>

20:13.701 --> 20:15.367
<i>"Pinch them," she whispered.</i>

20:15.369 --> 20:17.268
<i>No marriage, no matter
how strong, could survive her.</i>

20:17.270 --> 20:19.438
<i>This was what it meant
to fall.</i>

20:37.389 --> 20:38.923
Hey. It's me.

20:38.925 --> 20:41.159
I need you to call me back
right now.

20:41.161 --> 20:42.193
Call me.

20:49.870 --> 20:51.635
Shit.

22:29.964 --> 22:31.832
Where's Noah?

22:31.834 --> 22:33.232
I'm sorry?

22:33.234 --> 22:38.204
I need to talk to him.
It's urgent.

22:38.206 --> 22:39.506
Well, he's not here.

22:39.508 --> 22:41.207
<i>Mom, who is it?</i>

22:41.209 --> 22:43.209
It's nobody.

22:43.211 --> 22:45.979
You have a lot of balls
coming to my house.

22:45.981 --> 22:48.448
Look, I... I didn't mean to...

22:50.717 --> 22:52.050
Go on.

22:52.052 --> 22:55.287
I wasn't trying to steal
your husband.

22:55.289 --> 22:56.655
You weren't trying to steal
my Hus...

22:56.657 --> 22:58.657
No, I'm not
that kind of person.

22:58.659 --> 22:59.992
I-I didn't make him do this.

22:59.994 --> 23:01.861
I wasn't out for him,
for anyone.

23:01.863 --> 23:04.129
I just... it sort of happened,
and I'm...

23:04.131 --> 23:05.898
- I'm sorry, I just...
- Okay.

23:05.900 --> 23:08.534
Look, I don't know
what you're in the middle of,

23:08.536 --> 23:09.702
and I really don't care,

23:09.704 --> 23:11.436
but let me just tell you
a few things

23:11.438 --> 23:14.639
about the man you sort of
happen to be involved with.

23:16.609 --> 23:19.544
At first, Noah seems like
the greatest guy on earth.

23:19.546 --> 23:22.079
He's, um, there for you,
and he wants you,

23:22.081 --> 23:25.082
and he's romantic and passionate
and understanding.

23:25.084 --> 23:29.086
But then you start to
really get to know each other,

23:29.088 --> 23:33.691
and he feels safe enough
to let you see who he really is.

23:35.728 --> 23:38.429
And then he takes
all of his fears,

23:38.431 --> 23:40.898
all of his failure,

23:40.900 --> 23:42.933
all of his petty bullshit,

23:42.935 --> 23:45.903
all of his fucking headaches
in the morning,

23:45.905 --> 23:48.539
and he makes all of that
your fault.

23:51.108 --> 23:54.277
And then you become the enemy

23:54.279 --> 23:58.549
just because you know who he is.

23:58.551 --> 24:00.918
And then one day,

24:00.920 --> 24:05.922
somebody's going to show up
at your house,

24:05.924 --> 24:09.324
thinking they fell in love
with the greatest guy on earth.

24:09.326 --> 24:12.595
If you'll excuse me.

25:12.167 --> 25:16.141
_

25:30.871 --> 25:32.038
Hey.

25:32.040 --> 25:34.207
Hey.

25:34.209 --> 25:36.676
What are you doing here?

25:36.678 --> 25:38.578
I work here.

25:38.580 --> 25:39.878
What are you doing here?

25:39.880 --> 25:41.913
<i>Hello?</i>

25:41.915 --> 25:44.116
Ah, yeah.

25:48.322 --> 25:50.822
Can I have more grapes now?

25:50.824 --> 25:52.558
Yes, baby.
Go back to the kitchen.

25:52.560 --> 25:54.693
I'll be right there.

25:57.930 --> 25:59.765
Sorry.

26:08.708 --> 26:11.176
<i>Are you coming up or not?</i>

26:26.392 --> 26:30.494
Well, there he is.

26:33.498 --> 26:36.000
Quick and quiet.

26:36.002 --> 26:37.601
Okay?

26:37.603 --> 26:39.103
Okay.

26:42.140 --> 26:43.708
Oh.

26:46.078 --> 26:47.877
God, I am

26:47.879 --> 26:52.582
so fucking horny
for you.

26:52.584 --> 26:55.384
Jesus Christ.

26:57.988 --> 27:00.423
Okay, take off your clothes.

27:00.425 --> 27:01.825
Come on.
Take 'em off.

27:03.293 --> 27:04.960
Here. Come on.

27:09.634 --> 27:12.134
Oh.

27:12.136 --> 27:14.002
Mmm. Like this?

27:14.004 --> 27:15.137
Mm, yep.

27:15.139 --> 27:18.474
Ooh, oh. Like that?

27:18.476 --> 27:19.708
Yeah.

27:19.710 --> 27:21.543
- That's working for me.
- Yeah?

27:21.545 --> 27:25.614
Ranch hand.

27:25.616 --> 27:27.482
Can I call you ranch hand?

27:27.484 --> 27:31.553
Yeah, I heard about
what you used to do.

27:32.957 --> 27:36.358
Yeah, you gonna ride me,
ranch hand.

27:36.360 --> 27:37.893
Oh, yeah.

27:37.895 --> 27:39.995
Ride me, ranch hand. Oh, yeah.

27:39.997 --> 27:42.196
I told all of my friends

27:42.198 --> 27:45.733
about the rides I get
from my Montauk ranch hand.

27:45.735 --> 27:48.369
- Shh.
- Yeah, they're so jealous.

27:48.371 --> 27:50.271
Look at you.

27:50.273 --> 27:51.538
Oh, fuck.

27:51.540 --> 27:53.507
Oh!

27:53.509 --> 27:55.476
Yeah, oh.

27:55.478 --> 27:59.113
Shut the fuck up.

27:59.115 --> 28:01.749
- Yeah, shut me up.
- Shut up, shut up.

28:01.751 --> 28:03.383
- Oh, yeah, shut me up.
- Shut up.

28:03.385 --> 28:06.920
- Oh, shut me up. Shut me up.
- Shut up.

28:06.922 --> 28:08.789
Oh, hey, come on my face.

28:08.791 --> 28:09.790
What?

28:09.792 --> 28:13.226
Yeah, yeah, come on.
Come on.

28:13.228 --> 28:15.061
Come on my face.

28:17.266 --> 28:18.698
What the fuck?

28:18.700 --> 28:19.766
Aw, shit.

28:19.768 --> 28:21.401
You were
supposed to be golfing.

28:21.403 --> 28:24.904
Oh, shit.

28:24.906 --> 28:28.675
Get the fuck out!

28:37.083 --> 28:38.351
Go check around there.

28:38.353 --> 28:40.353
Say how many square feet?

28:41.690 --> 28:44.023
Yeah?
What did she say?

28:44.025 --> 28:46.759
What have you got?
What?

28:46.761 --> 28:48.960
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

28:48.962 --> 28:50.529
Yeah?
What do you think?

28:57.737 --> 29:01.340
You mind if I ask you just what
the fuck it is you're doing?

29:01.342 --> 29:05.610
Hi there.
Scotty Lockhart?

29:05.612 --> 29:06.778
No.

29:06.780 --> 29:08.313
I'm so sorry.

29:08.315 --> 29:11.816
Someone named Scotty Lockhart
called us.

29:11.818 --> 29:13.084
Sorry, I'm Abigail.

29:13.086 --> 29:14.785
These are my colleagues.
We're here

29:14.787 --> 29:16.587
- from Marla Bay Real Estate.
- Uh-huh.

29:16.589 --> 29:18.522
It's just that someone
named Scotty Lockhart told us

29:18.524 --> 29:20.124
he owned this house,

29:20.126 --> 29:22.260
and he asked us
to let him know what we thought

29:22.262 --> 29:23.928
we could put it
on the market for.

29:23.930 --> 29:25.629
Scotty's my brother.

29:25.631 --> 29:27.665
This is my place.
It's not for sale.

29:27.667 --> 29:29.067
What do you have,

29:29.069 --> 29:31.268
1,000 feet of beachfront
out there?

29:31.270 --> 29:36.273
I'm going to have
to ask you folks to leave.

29:36.275 --> 29:40.544
Look, I'll give you my card in
case you change your mind, okay?

29:41.747 --> 29:44.047
And I really hope you do.

29:57.095 --> 29:59.462
Hey, Scotty.
You in there?

29:59.464 --> 30:01.131
<i>Who is it?</i>

30:01.133 --> 30:02.665
It's me.

30:02.667 --> 30:04.667
<i>C-can you come back in a bit?</i>

30:04.669 --> 30:06.636
No.

30:06.638 --> 30:11.640
<i>All right, hang on a second.</i>

30:11.642 --> 30:13.276
I catch you in the middle
of something?

30:13.278 --> 30:15.912
Uh, yeah.

30:15.914 --> 30:18.614
- This is fucking bullshit.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

30:18.616 --> 30:19.949
- Don't ever do that again.
- Look, look, look.

30:19.951 --> 30:21.284
Just hear me out, okay?
Just fucking hear...

30:21.286 --> 30:22.451
Keep those assholes
off my property.

30:22.453 --> 30:23.986
Look, Cole,
just listen to me, okay?

30:23.988 --> 30:25.354
I've got something for us.

30:25.356 --> 30:28.190
Something I want you
to think about.

30:28.192 --> 30:30.026
Us?

30:30.028 --> 30:32.594
Yeah, Cole, us.

30:32.596 --> 30:34.329
Your family.
You remember us?

30:34.331 --> 30:35.764
We got a mom, she's about
yea high, four brothers.

30:35.766 --> 30:37.399
Is it ringing a bell?

30:37.401 --> 30:40.335
Look, okay, okay, okay, okay,
I'll get to the point.

30:40.337 --> 30:42.270
Oscar, right?

30:42.272 --> 30:44.973
He got all his, whatever,
approvals, right?

30:44.975 --> 30:48.009
And made some big deal about
breaking ground in the fall,

30:48.011 --> 30:51.847
and then what happened?

30:51.849 --> 30:54.281
He lost his loan.

30:54.283 --> 30:56.484
- How do you know that?
- City records.

30:56.486 --> 30:58.753
There is a huge tax lien
on the property,

30:58.755 --> 31:00.888
which means he's not
paying his mortgage

31:00.890 --> 31:03.758
and he is going to
lose the place.

31:03.760 --> 31:05.526
Okay.

31:05.528 --> 31:09.063
So I have an investor.

31:09.065 --> 31:10.665
Some hedge fund guy, whatever,

31:10.667 --> 31:15.201
but he's willing to go in
on something with me.

31:15.203 --> 31:17.170
Something with you?

31:17.172 --> 31:19.806
Look, man, is that
so inconceivable?

31:19.808 --> 31:23.844
And what is it?

31:23.846 --> 31:25.712
I want to build a nightclub.

31:25.714 --> 31:27.180
A nightclub.

31:27.182 --> 31:28.982
It's an ever-changing world,
Cole.

31:28.984 --> 31:30.817
Scotty, you're living
on a fishing boat.

31:30.819 --> 31:32.819
What I'm asking

31:32.821 --> 31:36.154
is that you get her
to sell that house.

31:36.156 --> 31:37.656
Even after you split a sale,

31:37.658 --> 31:40.025
you could invest
half of your profit in this

31:40.027 --> 31:41.994
and you would still be
doing great.

31:41.996 --> 31:44.730
I just...

31:44.732 --> 31:46.799
I want to be able
to tell my guy that I can...

31:46.801 --> 31:49.735
I can bring
some money to the table.

31:49.737 --> 31:53.338
How much?

31:53.340 --> 31:56.709
A mil.

31:56.711 --> 31:59.378
Come on, man,
we can do this.

31:59.380 --> 32:00.812
We can do this.

32:00.814 --> 32:02.981
The Lockhart brothers
back in business.

32:02.983 --> 32:05.283
And this time it's even better,
okay?

32:05.285 --> 32:07.719
It's... it's legit, okay?

32:07.721 --> 32:09.621
Come on, Cole, please.

32:09.623 --> 32:11.423
I got to get back to work.

32:11.425 --> 32:14.326
Look, Montauk is over, man.

32:14.328 --> 32:17.295
The old Montauk, it's gone.

32:17.297 --> 32:19.063
If we don't put our money
into the future,

32:19.065 --> 32:21.566
we might as well just... just lay
down in the middle of the road

32:21.568 --> 32:23.434
and let the summer people
drive all over us.

32:23.436 --> 32:27.572
It's basically what
we're doing here.

32:27.574 --> 32:29.541
You know what, Scotty?

32:29.543 --> 32:33.044
I need to go.
I'm late for work.

32:42.219 --> 32:47.157
Uh, you two know each other
or something?

32:47.159 --> 32:48.291
Yeah, just a little.

32:48.293 --> 32:50.093
Not at all.

32:51.229 --> 32:53.797
Okay, brother,
time for you to go.

32:53.799 --> 32:57.968
Thanks for dropping by, man.

32:57.970 --> 33:00.370
Glad I did.

33:10.714 --> 33:13.015
Hey. Are you Scotty?

33:13.017 --> 33:15.618
No, that's him down there
on that shitty boat.

33:23.493 --> 33:26.062
Ah, fuck, Scotty.

33:32.102 --> 33:34.536
Are you fucking kidding me?

33:34.538 --> 33:36.038
- It's just...
- Are you fucking kidding me?

33:36.040 --> 33:37.473
No, I'm... I'm clean.

33:37.475 --> 33:39.208
You're a fucking
drug dealer, right?

33:39.210 --> 33:41.443
- Don't...
- Please don't...

33:44.447 --> 33:45.814
Fuck!

34:03.432 --> 34:04.432
Hey, you okay?

34:04.434 --> 34:07.135
Oh, motherfucker.

34:08.504 --> 34:09.870
Me? I'm a motherfucker, huh?

34:09.871 --> 34:11.772
No.

34:11.774 --> 34:15.176
My... my work clothes
are on the boat.

34:15.178 --> 34:16.110
Fuck...

34:20.581 --> 34:22.681
You want me to go get it
for you?

34:25.686 --> 34:27.853
Okay. Thank you.

34:34.895 --> 34:37.063
She wants her stuff.

34:37.065 --> 34:40.498
Seriously, do you know her?

34:40.501 --> 34:42.268
I do not. Really.

34:49.576 --> 34:53.713
Don't fuck her, man.

34:53.715 --> 34:55.848
Believe me,

34:55.850 --> 34:57.550
I'm the last person on earth
she'd want to fuck.

34:57.552 --> 34:58.684
I'm serious.

34:58.686 --> 35:00.852
And knock that shit off,
would you?

35:00.854 --> 35:04.589
I mean, it's broad daylight,
for Christ's sake.

35:06.292 --> 35:08.727
Think about my idea.

35:08.729 --> 35:10.662
I'll give you a call tomorrow.

35:16.602 --> 35:19.770
Thank you.

35:19.772 --> 35:23.140
Shit.

35:23.142 --> 35:25.642
Hi, um, I need a cab
from the mar...

35:25.644 --> 35:28.846
Hello?

35:28.848 --> 35:30.280
Fuck!

35:31.349 --> 35:33.250
I got a cab right here.

36:08.551 --> 36:09.952
So where am I going?

36:09.954 --> 36:11.220
The End.

36:11.222 --> 36:14.422
And hurry, my shift
starts in ten minutes.

36:19.395 --> 36:21.329
Sorry.

36:24.867 --> 36:26.400
So how long has that thing
between you and Scotty

36:26.402 --> 36:27.401
been going on?

36:27.403 --> 36:29.470
What the fuck do you care?

36:29.472 --> 36:30.972
I don't, really.

36:30.974 --> 36:32.573
I just didn't know
he was dating anybody.

36:33.576 --> 36:35.709
What? What's so funny?

36:35.711 --> 36:37.411
Are you and Tory dating?

36:37.413 --> 36:39.914
Absolutely not.

36:39.916 --> 36:41.348
Okay, what would you
call it then?

36:41.350 --> 36:43.517
Well, I'd call it fucking.

36:43.519 --> 36:45.052
Bingo.

36:46.655 --> 36:48.454
Eyes on the road.

36:51.659 --> 36:54.594
Fuck, I can't believe
how stupid I've been.

36:57.198 --> 36:58.965
I wouldn't beat yourself up
that much.

36:58.967 --> 37:03.770
Scotty's slept with
half the women in this town.

37:03.772 --> 37:05.806
Sorry,
that didn't come out right.

37:09.110 --> 37:12.444
Well, not only he's my boss,
he's a fucking drug dealer.

37:12.446 --> 37:14.246
He's your boss?

37:14.248 --> 37:15.614
Yeah.

37:15.616 --> 37:17.950
Where?

37:17.952 --> 37:19.785
The End.

37:19.787 --> 37:21.019
What's he doing there?

37:21.021 --> 37:24.389
He's the fucking manager.

37:24.391 --> 37:28.293
Really? Scotty?

37:28.295 --> 37:30.462
Wow, you guys are close, huh?

37:33.766 --> 37:35.534
Nah, not anymore.

37:35.536 --> 37:39.070
Yeah, well, he was the one
that hired me.

37:41.741 --> 37:43.274
Too bad I can't sue him

37:43.276 --> 37:46.777
or else I will bankrupt
your entire family.

37:46.779 --> 37:49.447
Why can't you sue him?

37:49.449 --> 37:52.416
I, um...

37:52.418 --> 37:55.553
I'm undocumented.

37:55.555 --> 37:57.054
Really?

37:57.056 --> 37:58.756
Yeah.

37:58.758 --> 38:00.057
Do you have a problem with that?

38:00.059 --> 38:02.626
Me? No.

38:02.628 --> 38:04.328
No, no, no.

38:04.330 --> 38:07.998
Which is why I cannot get caught
on a boat of a drug dealer.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.833
Which your brother
failed to mention

38:09.835 --> 38:11.934
because he only seems
to articulate things

38:11.936 --> 38:15.739
that are directly related
to him getting laid.

38:18.642 --> 38:20.677
You know, it is actually
legal for aliens

38:20.679 --> 38:22.846
to sue U.S. citizens
in federal court.

38:22.848 --> 38:25.448
What?

38:25.450 --> 38:29.018
Yeah, so just,
you know, FYI.

38:30.921 --> 38:35.424
So you're telling me that
if I wanted to sue your brother,

38:35.426 --> 38:37.994
I could?

38:37.996 --> 38:39.061
Yep.

38:41.131 --> 38:44.767
Huh.
What happened between you two?

39:02.018 --> 39:03.551
The End.

39:03.553 --> 39:05.086
How much is it?

39:05.088 --> 39:07.122
Please, this one's on me.

39:09.191 --> 39:11.526
Okay. Thank you.

39:24.772 --> 39:27.274
So how do I look?

39:28.676 --> 39:31.211
Good.

39:31.213 --> 39:32.579
You look good.

40:40.713 --> 40:43.848
Mind if I sit here
for a drink?

40:43.850 --> 40:45.350
Sure.

40:48.921 --> 40:51.089
What do you want?

40:51.091 --> 40:53.025
I'll take a red ale, please.

41:04.569 --> 41:08.272
I'm not my brother.

41:08.274 --> 41:11.708
Just thought
you should know that.

41:11.710 --> 41:14.611
Okay.

41:14.613 --> 41:16.580
Okay.

41:20.786 --> 41:23.486
Can I get a bourbon too?
On the rocks.

41:26.123 --> 41:29.092
Sure.

41:29.094 --> 41:31.494
Well, you certainly drink
like your brother.

41:41.372 --> 41:42.806
Thank you.

41:46.410 --> 41:47.477
Miss?

41:47.479 --> 41:48.878
Yes.

42:04.963 --> 42:07.563
Can I have another bourbon?

42:07.565 --> 42:08.864
Sure.

42:18.941 --> 42:21.143
Where are you from?

42:21.145 --> 42:23.612
Um, Queens.

42:23.614 --> 42:25.046
Queens? I thought you said...

42:25.048 --> 42:29.551
Yeah, I-I came with my mom
when I was ten.

42:29.553 --> 42:32.454
From Ecuador.

42:32.456 --> 42:34.156
Mm.

42:35.791 --> 42:38.960
What about you?
What's your story?

42:41.531 --> 42:43.665
I don't really have one.

42:43.667 --> 42:45.366
Really?

42:45.368 --> 42:47.335
You were born this morose?

42:50.472 --> 42:52.973
Okay. I was born here.

42:52.975 --> 42:55.143
Mm-hmm.

42:55.145 --> 42:58.613
My father was born here.
My grandfather was born here.

42:58.615 --> 43:02.150
And your son
will be Chinese.

43:05.587 --> 43:08.722
Oh, come on.

43:08.724 --> 43:12.460
It was a joke.

43:12.462 --> 43:14.529
I know.

43:14.531 --> 43:17.632
Uh, you think I can
get the check, please?

43:17.634 --> 43:18.965
What the hell?
What did I say?

43:18.967 --> 43:21.501
Nothing, just...
40 bucks cover this?

43:21.503 --> 43:23.537
It was a joke.

43:23.539 --> 43:25.539
I'm sorry if I offended you, but
you don't have to be an assh...

43:25.541 --> 43:27.474
My son is dead.

43:30.611 --> 43:32.679
Oh, shit, I'm...

43:32.681 --> 43:34.181
I'm sorry.

43:34.183 --> 43:35.515
You didn't know.

43:35.517 --> 43:38.218
How much do I owe you?

43:38.220 --> 43:39.252
Sit down.

43:39.254 --> 43:40.787
No, I got
to get out of here.

43:40.789 --> 43:42.455
No, you don't.
Sit down.

43:42.457 --> 43:44.457
I owe you a drink.

43:44.459 --> 43:46.493
Sit.

43:51.298 --> 43:54.099
Let's start from the beginning.

43:56.002 --> 43:58.604
My name is Luisa.

43:58.606 --> 44:01.607
I'm 29, and I'm from Queens.

44:01.609 --> 44:04.743
I'm, uh, I'm working here
this summer

44:04.745 --> 44:07.213
because I want to save enough
money to go back to school.

44:10.483 --> 44:11.950
Eventually I'd like to get
my degree in hospitality,

44:11.952 --> 44:15.421
and hopefully someday
I can run my own restaurant.

44:18.124 --> 44:20.559
What about you?

44:24.698 --> 44:26.063
I'm Cole.

44:28.634 --> 44:30.901
Okay.

44:30.903 --> 44:32.737
That's a great start.

44:38.143 --> 44:40.111
Okay.

44:41.947 --> 44:44.415
What are we drinking to?

44:46.752 --> 44:48.686
You decide.

44:52.090 --> 44:54.024
To...

44:56.762 --> 44:58.696
To something else.

45:02.667 --> 45:05.769
To something else.

47:22.502 --> 47:24.136
Hey.

47:31.344 --> 47:33.879
Hi.

47:33.881 --> 47:37.649
Are you all right?

47:37.651 --> 47:38.984
I don't know.

47:38.986 --> 47:41.086
You don't know?

47:43.890 --> 47:45.824
Do we have anything to drink?

47:49.495 --> 47:50.629
We?

47:52.832 --> 47:54.900
Is there anything to drink?

48:00.372 --> 48:02.140
Uh...

48:15.688 --> 48:18.423
I think there's only my...
my grandfather's moonshine left.

48:18.425 --> 48:20.592
Is that all right?

48:20.594 --> 48:22.694
You haven't been
living here?

48:24.831 --> 48:26.163
No.

48:54.292 --> 48:56.026
What's going on?
Did something happen?

48:56.028 --> 48:58.496
I don't know.

48:58.498 --> 49:00.731
Did he do something?

49:04.135 --> 49:08.938
I'm afraid there might be
something wrong with me.

49:08.940 --> 49:10.407
What's that
supposed to mean?

49:10.409 --> 49:15.178
Does everyone just think
I'm... I'm a slut?

49:15.180 --> 49:19.316
I don't know
what everyone thinks.

49:19.318 --> 49:20.283
Do you?

49:24.455 --> 49:26.956
No, of course I don't.

49:28.993 --> 49:31.228
I think there's something wrong
with me.

49:31.230 --> 49:32.896
You got to stop saying that.

49:32.898 --> 49:35.565
People don't see me, Cole.

49:35.567 --> 49:38.402
They don't.

49:38.404 --> 49:41.438
I don't know,
they just want to fuck me or...

49:41.440 --> 49:45.441
they don't see me.

49:45.443 --> 49:48.411
They don't care.

49:48.413 --> 49:52.782
Sometimes I'm worried I'm...
that I'm not a real person,

49:52.784 --> 49:54.984
that I'm just a...

49:54.986 --> 49:56.619
a figment
of people's imaginations.

49:56.621 --> 49:57.554
I...

50:00.691 --> 50:04.160
You know, when I was a child,

50:04.162 --> 50:08.831
I thought I would do something
with my life,

50:08.833 --> 50:13.502
I would make a difference.

50:13.504 --> 50:17.173
I was certain of it, certain
that I would matter to people.

50:17.175 --> 50:18.942
- And you do.
- No, I don't.

50:18.944 --> 50:21.310
That's the whole point, Cole.
I don't. I'm nothing.

50:21.312 --> 50:22.711
No.

50:24.781 --> 50:26.715
Not to me.

50:41.497 --> 50:43.298
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't be here.

50:43.300 --> 50:45.901
- I should be going.
- Hey, stop. Don't.

50:53.175 --> 50:55.510
You look exhausted.

50:55.512 --> 50:56.444
I...

51:06.387 --> 51:08.255
I think
you should stay here tonight.

51:10.458 --> 51:14.528
You can deal with it
in the morning.

51:14.530 --> 51:18.032
You don't mind if I stay?

51:18.034 --> 51:21.568
It's your house, Alison.

51:38.853 --> 51:41.821
Cole?

51:41.823 --> 51:44.291
Can you just stay?

53:53.051 --> 53:55.552
Hey.

53:57.622 --> 53:59.156
Hey.

53:59.158 --> 54:02.159
How's it going?

54:02.161 --> 54:03.493
It's going pretty good.

54:03.495 --> 54:05.829
Oh, yeah?

54:05.831 --> 54:08.265
Did you have a good night?

54:08.267 --> 54:10.100
What are you doing here,
Scotty?

54:10.102 --> 54:13.403
I-I just thought
I'd stop by,

54:13.405 --> 54:14.537
we could finish
our conversation.

54:14.539 --> 54:15.538
Can I... can I come in?

54:15.540 --> 54:16.840
No.

54:18.876 --> 54:20.576
Why not?

54:20.578 --> 54:22.779
You got company?

54:28.519 --> 54:33.256
Oh, you... you fucked her,
didn't you?

54:33.258 --> 54:34.691
Time for you to go home,
little brother.

54:34.693 --> 54:37.994
You motherfucker.

54:37.996 --> 54:40.162
She's mine.

54:42.232 --> 54:43.265
This is not
what you think it is.

54:43.267 --> 54:44.533
You got a problem, Cole.

54:44.535 --> 54:46.936
You got a big fucking problem.

54:46.938 --> 54:48.403
- You're a goddamn narcissist.
- Scott...

54:48.405 --> 54:49.872
You take everything
for your fucking self!

54:49.874 --> 54:51.573
Lower your voice.

54:51.575 --> 54:53.408
You literally think that you are
the only person that exists...

54:53.410 --> 54:54.743
Listen to me. Lower your
motherfucking voice right now.

54:54.745 --> 54:56.378
...in this entire
fucking universe!

54:56.380 --> 54:58.413
It's all about your pain,
your loss, your kid!

54:58.415 --> 55:00.182
Cole.

55:00.184 --> 55:02.251
Oh, Scott.

55:02.253 --> 55:04.419
Fuck.

55:22.171 --> 55:24.505
Okay.

55:24.507 --> 55:27.942
You have a good night.

55:49.299 --> 55:53.166
How's the coffee?

55:53.168 --> 55:54.467
What do you want?

55:54.469 --> 55:55.668
Nothing.

55:55.670 --> 55:57.337
Really, I was just driving by.

55:57.339 --> 55:59.239
Saw your car in the parking lot,
thought I'd stop in,

55:59.241 --> 56:02.976
see if you've arrested any more
innocent men this morning.

56:02.978 --> 56:04.511
No?

56:04.513 --> 56:06.413
Well, it's still early yet.

56:06.415 --> 56:08.382
I'm on my way to discovery.

56:08.384 --> 56:10.017
I can't wait to see the evidence

56:10.019 --> 56:12.652
little Miss Prosecutor
Pantiliner wants to show me.

56:12.654 --> 56:15.022
Can you give me any hints?

56:15.024 --> 56:16.489
No, no, no, man, I got this.

56:16.491 --> 56:19.359
- It's all right.
- Guess what.

56:19.361 --> 56:21.628
I've been digging around this
place for the last 72 hours.

56:21.630 --> 56:23.363
You know what I found out?

56:23.365 --> 56:26.866
Half... half the people
in this town

56:26.868 --> 56:29.235
wanted to see
Scott Lockhart dead.

56:29.237 --> 56:31.905
Half.
So you know what I'm thinking?

56:31.907 --> 56:36.309
I'm wondering, why did you
zero in on my client so fast,

56:36.311 --> 56:38.344
no criminal record,
out-of-towner?

56:38.346 --> 56:40.980
Lockhart was fucking
Solloway's underage daughter.

56:40.982 --> 56:45.618
Yes, he was, which is why he
beat the living shit out of him,

56:45.620 --> 56:47.821
because that's what
perverts deserve.

56:47.823 --> 56:52.826
But he'd have to be crazy
to kill the guy, wouldn't he?

56:52.828 --> 56:56.696
I mean, that's nuts, right?

56:56.698 --> 57:00.533
Not like, say, Scott's brother,

57:00.535 --> 57:04.069
who stole Scott's business plan
right out from under his nose.

57:04.071 --> 57:05.771
And then maybe, I don't know,

57:05.773 --> 57:08.073
he couldn't sleep at night,
so he starts to think,

57:08.075 --> 57:09.274
"I'm going to
get rid of my brother.

57:09.276 --> 57:11.242
I'm going to"...

57:11.244 --> 57:14.480
"I'm going to get Scott out of
the picture once and for all."

57:14.482 --> 57:16.214
What do you think?

57:16.216 --> 57:18.450
Put that away.
I told you, I got this.

57:18.452 --> 57:20.485
See you in court, asshole.

57:29.027 --> 57:31.028
Good morning.

57:31.030 --> 57:32.262
Morning.

57:32.264 --> 57:34.064
Some coffee?

57:34.066 --> 57:35.967
Yes, if it's hot.

57:35.969 --> 57:38.870
Hot enough to kill you.

57:38.872 --> 57:42.940
You're Solloway's lawyer,
aren't you?

57:42.942 --> 57:44.008
Yes.

57:45.711 --> 57:47.144
You think he'll get off?

57:47.146 --> 57:50.047
What's it to you?
