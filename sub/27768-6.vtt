MOBILE NOTIFICATION

00:38.320 --> 00:39.760
Who's that?

00:40.800 --> 00:43.240
Sorry. Didn't want to wake you.

00:43.240 --> 00:44.320
What's happening?

00:44.320 --> 00:47.160
It's work. They've called me
in for the early shift.

00:47.160 --> 00:49.120
They left it a bit late,
didn't they?

00:49.120 --> 00:51.040
One of the porters called in sick.

00:53.040 --> 00:56.520
Oh, come on. Why else
am I sneaking out at 5am?

00:58.320 --> 01:01.520
Check my phone
if you don't believe me.

01:01.520 --> 01:03.960
Sorry. You're right.

01:07.120 --> 01:08.560
I'll see you tonight.

01:12.400 --> 01:14.640
Hey, I thought you had to leave?

01:15.760 --> 01:17.200
Love you.

01:19.320 --> 01:20.720
You too.

01:28.320 --> 01:31.760
Mum, have you seen my tongs? I look
like Motley Crue without them.

01:31.760 --> 01:33.160
What's that, love?

01:33.160 --> 01:36.120
I wish you'd put things back after
you've finished borrowing them.

01:36.120 --> 01:39.040
Look at this. Some freighter's
capsized just off shore.

01:39.040 --> 01:41.720
That's terrible.
Is everyone all right?

01:41.720 --> 01:43.040
Look at all that loot.

01:43.040 --> 01:45.800
They say there's containers
washed up all along the coast,

01:45.800 --> 01:48.760
chock full of goodies. Your concern
for the crew is touching.

01:48.760 --> 01:51.000
Hey, that's Billy Claxton,
from down the road.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.560
I might get down there. Take a look.
You're not serious?

01:53.560 --> 01:57.520
It's fine. Shipwrecks have been
washing up here for centuries.

01:57.520 --> 02:00.680
The words "vulture" and "carcass"
spring to mind. Yeah, Gran.

02:00.680 --> 02:03.560
Sounds like something only a real
lowlife would think of doing.

02:03.560 --> 02:07.080
Jude! It's time to go shopping.
My treat.

02:07.080 --> 02:08.479
Whoo-hoo!

03:05.280 --> 03:06.600
Sarge.

03:06.600 --> 03:08.200
CAR PULLS UP

03:21.640 --> 03:24.440
Jogger found him this morning.
Male, 20s.

03:24.440 --> 03:28.120
Looks like he broke into
the container, probably looting,

03:28.120 --> 03:30.400
dislodged one of those
metal lockboxes there,

03:30.400 --> 03:31.880
knocked himself out cold.

03:31.880 --> 03:34.520
Died when the tide came in,
filling up the container.

03:34.520 --> 03:36.400
Was there anything on him? No.

03:36.400 --> 03:39.600
No wallet or ID, we got house
and car keys, mobile phone.

03:39.600 --> 03:42.680
But that's damp, so lab guys
are working on that as we speak.

03:43.960 --> 03:46.120
And we found this in his pocket.

03:46.120 --> 03:48.040
That's an engagement ring.

03:48.040 --> 03:50.120
Right now it's evidence.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.080
At least we know
why he was in there.

03:53.080 --> 03:55.080
So, nothing suspicious?

03:55.080 --> 03:58.160
Nope. Just your average,
pointless death.

03:59.320 --> 04:03.000
I don't understand.
He died by accident?

04:03.000 --> 04:04.600
You mean thieving?

04:04.600 --> 04:08.000
I'm sorry to say we don't know the
exact details of why he was there.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
But he was supposed
to be in Plymouth.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.880
He had an early shift.
Is that what he told you?

04:12.880 --> 04:15.320
He wasn't like that.
MOBILE NOTIFICATION

04:15.320 --> 04:18.399
Abby, is there anything else you'd
like to tell us about Ian? Yes.

04:18.399 --> 04:20.920
That he was a liar and a fraud,

04:20.920 --> 04:23.360
and that he didn't deserve
my daughter. Dad!

04:23.360 --> 04:25.760
She asked! How about the recent
stint in prison?

04:25.760 --> 04:29.880
And the arrests for drugs and theft,
and God knows what else?
MOBILE NOTIFICATION

04:29.880 --> 04:31.040
And he paid for that!

04:32.560 --> 04:35.760
He'd made some mistakes, but he
changed in prison. He promised me.

04:35.760 --> 04:38.240
And now look what that's worth.

04:38.240 --> 04:41.000
Out looting the first chance he
gets, and the scoundrel

04:41.000 --> 04:44.040
couldn't even get that right.
He's just died!

04:44.040 --> 04:47.040
Can I go a minute without you
putting the boot in, please?

04:47.040 --> 04:48.680
MOBILE NOTIFICATION

04:48.680 --> 04:51.400
Don't let us
keep you from work, Dad.

04:51.400 --> 04:53.320
Sorry. Got to go.

04:56.840 --> 04:59.960
Please...
I need to know what happened.

05:01.440 --> 05:04.440
I know what my father thinks of Ian,
but he's a good man.

05:07.400 --> 05:11.760
He WAS a good man. He wouldn't have
been out there looting.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.080
I'll look into it, I promise.

05:17.560 --> 05:19.320
It's the oldest trick in the book.

05:19.320 --> 05:20.720
She turns on the waterworks

05:20.720 --> 05:23.600
and next thing you know you're
running around chasing your tail.

05:23.600 --> 05:24.960
She genuinely believed in him.

05:24.960 --> 05:26.680
Of course she does. She loved him.

05:26.680 --> 05:28.880
Doesn't change anything.

05:28.880 --> 05:31.080
Clint?

05:31.080 --> 05:34.760
Clint! Have you called
Ian Igby's workplace yet?

05:34.760 --> 05:37.280
Yeah, it's...next on my list.

05:37.280 --> 05:38.960
Can you ask around?

05:38.960 --> 05:40.880
See if anyone saw
Ian before he died.

05:40.880 --> 05:42.760
You're a soft touch, Kennedy.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.840
At least it sounds
like real police work.

05:44.840 --> 05:47.560
Boss has got me out catching
looters. I don't know why.

05:47.560 --> 05:50.200
We've always done it. Well, we used
to jump off Crabclaw Point

05:50.200 --> 05:52.520
when we were kids. Doesn't mean
it's smart, or legal.

05:52.520 --> 05:55.080
I bet you'd love to have a rummage
through those containers.

05:55.080 --> 05:58.040
No chance.
I'll settle for being a soft touch.

05:58.040 --> 05:59.880
They say they've never heard of Ian.

05:59.880 --> 06:03.000
What? You definitely called
the number Abby gave me?

06:03.000 --> 06:06.320
Yeah. It's just a restaurant in
Plymouth. They've no idea who he is.

06:06.320 --> 06:10.080
Interesting. I think this
calls for a little road trip.

06:36.720 --> 06:40.000
Andrea Matteo? Sorry. Didn't mean to
startle you. I'm Jane Kennedy,

06:40.000 --> 06:42.640
coroner for Lighthaven.
This is my assistant, Clint.

06:42.640 --> 06:45.160
How's it going? I hope you don't
mind. I called your office.

06:45.160 --> 06:46.720
They said we could find you here.

06:46.720 --> 06:49.280
Not at all.
Please excuse my appearance.

06:50.800 --> 06:53.680
You're Ian Igby's probation officer?

06:55.120 --> 06:57.520
Ever since he came out of prison.

06:57.520 --> 07:00.200
I help him adjust to life outside,

07:00.200 --> 07:02.840
to ease his re-entry
into the community.

07:02.840 --> 07:07.200
I'm very sorry to have to tell you,
but Ian has died.

07:07.200 --> 07:10.040
What? I saw him last week.

07:11.400 --> 07:13.880
Sorry, I just can't believe it.

07:13.880 --> 07:16.600
I understand. It's always a shock.

07:16.600 --> 07:19.480
I presume you didn't come all
this way just to tell me that?

07:19.480 --> 07:22.120
We've hit a snag trying to
find out where Ian worked.

07:22.120 --> 07:24.920
As I recall, Ian had problems
finding work, which is

07:24.920 --> 07:27.280
common for recent convicts.

07:27.280 --> 07:31.680
We found him a job as a clerk
in a local shipping firm.

07:31.680 --> 07:34.000
Prion Freight, I think.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.880
I can get you the address.

07:35.880 --> 07:37.400
Perfect. Thank you.

07:37.400 --> 07:39.640
He was one of the good ones.

07:39.640 --> 07:42.760
People that come out, you just know
they're going straight back in.

07:42.760 --> 07:44.440
But...he was different.

07:47.680 --> 07:51.360
Davey!
Delivered straight to my door!

07:51.360 --> 07:52.920
Hey...

07:54.680 --> 07:56.840
Give us a hand with this.
I can't do that, Judith.

07:56.840 --> 08:00.640
You've got to take this stuff back.
Giss on! We've got salvage rights.

08:00.640 --> 08:03.960
Had 'em since Good Queen Bess
sent them ruddy Dagos to the rocks

08:03.960 --> 08:07.200
back in 1588,
and had us search the shipwrecks.

08:07.200 --> 08:08.560
Look, I don't think quoting

08:08.560 --> 08:11.680
the Spanish Armada as an excuse
is going to stand up in court.

08:11.680 --> 08:14.680
Sea's our livelihood.
This is a gift, this is.

08:14.680 --> 08:16.840
Yeah, I understand that and if it
were up to me,

08:16.840 --> 08:19.880
I'd say, what's the harm? But it's
not.... Got you, Davey. Cheers.

08:19.880 --> 08:22.720
We understand what you're saying.
Great. Thanks, Mick.

08:22.720 --> 08:24.760
No. Thank you.

08:24.760 --> 08:26.560
A nod's as good as a wink,
as they say.

08:26.560 --> 08:28.760
No, no! Judith, there's no nods.
No winks.

08:28.760 --> 08:33.159
From a child's lips to God's ears.
Thank you, Davey.

08:54.240 --> 08:55.720
What do you want?

08:55.720 --> 08:59.120
Mr Brubaker. You're expanding.

08:59.120 --> 09:01.680
Free microwave with every bucket
and spade?

09:01.680 --> 09:03.280
That's salvage, that is.

09:03.280 --> 09:05.200
Apparently, it's theft.

09:05.200 --> 09:08.240
I didn't nick 'em.
I got them off old Mick.

09:08.240 --> 09:10.320
And where'd you think
he got them from?

09:10.320 --> 09:13.840
Mick suddenly becomes flush
with kitchen appliances?

09:13.840 --> 09:15.520
Didn't ask, did I?

09:15.520 --> 09:17.600
Just get them out of my sight,
will you?

09:17.600 --> 09:20.320
I don't mind people taking
a piece for themselves,

09:20.320 --> 09:22.400
but I can't have any serious
profiteering.

09:22.400 --> 09:25.480
Thanks, Davey.
Here, have a pasty, on the arm.

09:26.480 --> 09:28.480
You got beef and onion?

09:29.680 --> 09:31.040
Did you hear anything about

09:31.040 --> 09:33.240
that body that turned up
on Sherford Sands?

09:35.440 --> 09:36.960
Aye.

09:36.960 --> 09:39.520
Quickest way down there is just
down from your shop, innit?

09:39.520 --> 09:41.880
You didn't see
anyone go down there?

09:41.880 --> 09:44.000
Probably the early
hours of the morning?

09:44.000 --> 09:46.160
I was in bed,
like all decent people.

09:46.160 --> 09:49.040
And you didn't hear anything?
Anyone shouting for help?

09:49.040 --> 09:52.440
I'm too old to jump up at the sound
of every young 'eller making a fuss.

09:53.600 --> 09:56.000
I didn't say they were young.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.760
Haven't you got better things to do
than harass an old man?

09:59.760 --> 10:01.400
MICROWAVE PINGS

10:14.040 --> 10:16.080
Oh, hello, Davey.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.160
Ah, Davey boy, nice to see you.
Usual? No.

10:29.160 --> 10:30.880
It's official business today, Mick.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.320
I should've known you'd be
in the middle of all this.

10:33.320 --> 10:36.160
I don't know what you're talking
about. I just pull the pints, mate.

10:36.160 --> 10:38.760
Well, you want to have a little
break, then. In a prison cell.

10:38.760 --> 10:40.160
I mean, this is too much, mate.

10:40.160 --> 10:43.280
I can't have you turning a shipwreck
into your own personal marketplace.

10:43.280 --> 10:46.840
Really?
Well, maybe you ain't read this.

10:46.840 --> 10:48.480
What's that? Latest Dan Brown?

10:48.480 --> 10:53.360
That's the Merchant Shipping Act
1995, which states,

10:53.360 --> 10:57.080
"Any person taking possession of any
wreck in UK waters shall give

10:57.080 --> 11:01.440
"notice that he has taken possession
and hold it for the receiver."

11:01.440 --> 11:03.680
But, of course, you know all that,
don't you?

11:03.680 --> 11:05.520
The finer details escape me.

11:05.520 --> 11:09.360
Well, for the layman, it means that
my customers have got a month

11:09.360 --> 11:12.800
to hang on to what they've found
before you can even touch them.

11:12.800 --> 11:15.000
Only if they've filled out
a declaration form.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.800
I've got a stack of 'em here

11:16.800 --> 11:19.200
It's not my problem
if they forget to take it, is it?

11:20.240 --> 11:23.320
Just make sure everyone fills out a
form, will you? Yeah, course I will.

11:23.320 --> 11:24.600
Good luck, mate.

11:27.480 --> 11:29.000
Oi! What do you think you're up to?

11:29.000 --> 11:30.640
Salvage.

11:30.640 --> 11:32.200
Er...

11:34.560 --> 11:38.320
Surfing? We're there to deliver bad
news, and you wittering on

11:38.320 --> 11:42.520
about catching a wave? Well, when you
say it like that... Ms Kennedy?

11:42.520 --> 11:44.920
Mr Naseby? What're you doing here?

11:44.920 --> 11:46.720
Well, I could ask you
the same question.

11:46.720 --> 11:50.520
Ian Igby. He lied to your daughter
about where he worked.

11:50.520 --> 11:53.400
Sorry, I thought you people just
signed the death certificate?

11:53.400 --> 11:55.920
It's all part of the service.
You'd better come with me.

11:55.920 --> 11:58.440
Well, no, because we need to speak
to someone in charge.

11:58.440 --> 12:01.920
I am in charge.
I'm the owner of Prion Freight.

12:01.920 --> 12:04.480
And, for my sins, I hired Ian.

12:07.680 --> 12:10.200
It was my ship that sank out there.

12:10.200 --> 12:12.880
Millions in cargo lost at sea.

12:12.880 --> 12:16.920
And the only people angrier than
the clients are my shareholders.

12:16.920 --> 12:18.320
We are close to ruin.

12:18.320 --> 12:20.720
Why didn't you tell me
earlier that Ian worked for you?

12:20.720 --> 12:22.040
Why hire him?

12:22.040 --> 12:23.840
I did it for love.

12:23.840 --> 12:25.160
Not Ian's, I take it?

12:25.160 --> 12:28.120
No. For my daughter.
Look, she met him a year ago.

12:28.120 --> 12:30.680
He was a bad boy,
he was fresh out of prison.

12:30.680 --> 12:32.160
He was every father's nightmare.

12:32.160 --> 12:34.160
I had just hoped it was just
a rebellious stage.

12:34.160 --> 12:35.520
So, you gave him a job?

12:35.520 --> 12:38.080
Wow. I must remember that when
my daughter brings home a boy.

12:38.080 --> 12:40.560
If Abby's going to fall for an
idiot, at least he can be

12:40.560 --> 12:43.120
an employed idiot.
Anyway, I thought I could teach him

12:43.120 --> 12:44.840
some responsibility. More fool me.

12:44.840 --> 12:47.240
I don't get why you didn't
just tell Abby.

12:47.240 --> 12:49.840
You would've scored some major
parent points for that.

12:49.840 --> 12:53.080
Ian didn't want Abby knowing
he'd taken a hand-out from Daddy.

12:53.080 --> 12:54.840
MOBILE RINGS
The man had some pride.

12:54.840 --> 12:56.640
It was the one reason
I respected him.

12:56.640 --> 12:58.920
It sounds like she wasn't the only
one who got hurt.

12:58.920 --> 13:02.680
I opened my home to that boy.
I gave him a job.

13:02.680 --> 13:04.800
And this is how he repays me!

13:04.800 --> 13:09.600
By dying?
By betraying me! And Abby.

13:09.600 --> 13:12.400
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have got a company to save.

13:14.200 --> 13:16.160
It's Davey. Your phone was off.

13:16.160 --> 13:18.440
OK. Thanks. Hey.

13:18.440 --> 13:21.720
I thought I heard shouting.
Are you causing trouble again?

13:21.720 --> 13:23.920
Just helping a man grieve.
What's up?

13:23.920 --> 13:25.480
We've got Ian's call logs.

13:25.480 --> 13:27.840
There's a lot of calls from
one number sent the morning

13:27.840 --> 13:30.000
that he died, from a Brent Hess.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.440
He's also sent a strange text,

13:31.440 --> 13:34.360
'sent about an hour before.
So I've sent that over.

13:34.360 --> 13:38.080
'Now, it's a container number,
from a capsized ship.

13:38.080 --> 13:40.600
'The ship's manifest
lists its contents as perishables,

13:40.600 --> 13:42.000
'but that could mean anything.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.720
'I presume you'd want
to speak to Hess?'

13:43.720 --> 13:46.480
You know me so well. 'All right,
you want me to send his address?'

13:46.480 --> 13:48.520
No need. I won't have to go far.

13:56.560 --> 13:58.280
Excuse me, Mr Hess?

14:10.840 --> 14:13.640
Did you not hear me calling?
I'm working.

14:13.640 --> 14:15.040
I'm here about Ian Igby.

14:15.040 --> 14:16.440
And?

14:16.440 --> 14:18.480
You know he's dead?

14:18.480 --> 14:21.400
You made a dozen calls to his phone
the night he died. Why?

14:21.400 --> 14:24.320
It's none of your business. You can
tell me now or the police later.

14:24.320 --> 14:25.440
It's your choice.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.680
We were mates. All right?
He had my back.

14:30.680 --> 14:31.800
What? Here?

14:33.200 --> 14:36.480
Prison. You were together in prison.
So what? If it's no big deal,

14:36.480 --> 14:40.440
you can tell me what the phone calls
were about. I was just saying hello.

14:40.440 --> 14:41.960
At four in the morning?

14:43.840 --> 14:46.360
I said stay out of my business!

14:46.360 --> 14:49.520
Excuse me, mate! Mate! I'm recording
this, just so you know.

14:49.520 --> 14:52.800
So if you touch my boss,
this goes straight to the police.

14:57.080 --> 14:59.720
Thanks. Any time.

14:59.720 --> 15:02.240
This field work is pretty dangerous.

15:02.240 --> 15:03.680
Do we get hazard pay?

15:04.800 --> 15:06.120
No?

15:06.120 --> 15:09.080
So, Ian and Brent are both ex-cons,

15:09.080 --> 15:11.560
both working on the docks.

15:11.560 --> 15:14.840
Smells like a smuggling operation
to me. I thought Ian

15:14.840 --> 15:16.680
was more your "pinch-a-purse" type.

15:16.680 --> 15:18.800
Prison's like college
for these blokes, innit?

15:18.800 --> 15:21.240
You graduate to bigger things.

15:21.240 --> 15:22.840
And Brent's record reads like a...

15:22.840 --> 15:25.680
Eh! What? Sorry, I haven't eaten.

15:25.680 --> 15:28.160
I'm just going to order
two portions from now on.

15:28.160 --> 15:31.280
Brent's record? It's like a
Hows To of hurting people.

15:31.280 --> 15:33.160
In and out of prison his whole life.

15:33.160 --> 15:35.840
Definitely the muscle,
making Ian the brains.

15:35.840 --> 15:38.920
Hate to say I told you so.
You haven't proven anything yet.

15:38.920 --> 15:40.480
You and your lost causes.

15:40.480 --> 15:43.240
Sometimes it does exactly
what it says on the tin.

15:43.240 --> 15:46.640
We'll see. I thought you might say
that, which is why I checked out

15:46.640 --> 15:50.600
our friendly shopkeeper Brubaker,
who was a little bit shifty.

15:50.600 --> 15:53.280
Turns out he was the victim of
a robbery about three years back.

15:53.280 --> 15:55.440
And guess who got himself
arrested for it?

16:01.040 --> 16:02.760
Your lost cause.

16:26.400 --> 16:28.560
Hello, my beauty.

16:33.720 --> 16:35.920
What are you hiding?

16:40.840 --> 16:43.040
You've always been trouble.

16:43.040 --> 16:46.120
Ever since you were knee-high,
racing around my shop.

16:47.320 --> 16:50.000
Davey thought I was lying then,
did he?

16:50.000 --> 16:55.160
Well, just holding something back.
Call it gut instinct.

16:55.160 --> 16:59.200
Tell him to take some Rennies
instead of harassing old men.

17:01.760 --> 17:03.920
What happened on the night
of that break-in?

17:03.920 --> 17:06.040
It was just idiots messing about.

17:06.040 --> 17:10.079
I came down to catch them dipping
in the till, swiping my cigarettes.

17:10.079 --> 17:11.960
They pushed me over and scarpered.

17:11.960 --> 17:13.319
That's awful.

17:13.319 --> 17:16.920
I remember 'em laughing
and hollering when they went.

17:16.920 --> 17:18.680
I wanted to beat them
half to buggery,

17:18.680 --> 17:20.280
but I couldn't get up off the floor.

17:20.280 --> 17:22.040
I cried for help, but...

17:23.599 --> 17:26.040
I stayed on that floor till morning.

17:26.040 --> 17:28.480
Five hours, just waiting.

17:28.480 --> 17:29.960
Thinking...

17:31.240 --> 17:32.960
..will they come back?

17:34.960 --> 17:39.960
So...if Davey's sixth sense
picked up that

17:39.960 --> 17:44.640
I wasn't too teary-eyed over
Ian Igby, then now you know why.

17:44.640 --> 17:47.280
Ian drowned in one of those
containers.

17:48.720 --> 17:51.080
Water slowly rising.

17:51.080 --> 17:53.440
Probably took a couple of hours.

17:53.440 --> 17:54.760
Would have been dark.

17:54.760 --> 17:55.960
And?

17:56.880 --> 17:58.840
He was alone, too.

18:24.560 --> 18:26.800
Hiya. Hello, darling.

18:27.920 --> 18:29.560
Erm...what's this?

18:29.560 --> 18:32.040
Oh, that's my new hotrod.
I got it off the beach.

18:32.040 --> 18:33.840
You can't even ride a bike!

18:33.840 --> 18:35.560
So I'll learn.

18:35.560 --> 18:37.200
I'm not some old fogey.

18:41.200 --> 18:43.360
Careful! Mind my Adonis.

18:43.360 --> 18:45.920
What the hell is this doing here?
Oh, he's lovely, isn't he?

18:45.920 --> 18:47.880
Really adds some culture.

18:47.880 --> 18:49.680
It takes up half the living room!

18:49.680 --> 18:51.240
Nonsense.

18:51.240 --> 18:54.040
Maybe we could push it
into the corner a bit more,

18:54.040 --> 18:57.520
but he adds a certain
"raisin dextrous."

18:57.520 --> 19:01.320
It's raison d'etre,
and I don't want Beth facing his...

19:01.320 --> 19:03.040
well, every time she walks past.

19:03.040 --> 19:05.560
Come on, she's a big girl.
She's seen it all before.

19:05.560 --> 19:08.360
When I said I wanted her to be an
art lover, this isn't what I meant.

19:08.360 --> 19:11.160
Oh, nonsense.
It's only a bit of marble.

19:11.160 --> 19:12.360
There.

19:19.720 --> 19:22.080
Can I help you? Aye.

19:22.080 --> 19:26.200
A mate of mine got into a bit
of trouble here a few nights back.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.440
Did you see him around?

19:30.440 --> 19:32.960
I'm not the bloomin'
missing persons bureau.

19:32.960 --> 19:37.960
If you're not buying, then...
How much for just the bat?

19:39.440 --> 19:41.320
I was asleep. I didn't see anyone.

19:41.320 --> 19:44.920
He was looking for something.
Something I need to find.

19:44.920 --> 19:47.120
I don't know what you're
talking about.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.640
Who would?

19:49.640 --> 19:51.840
Try the Black Dog.

19:51.840 --> 19:54.680
The landlord there knows everything
that goes on. Please.

19:56.200 --> 20:00.000
On second thoughts,
I don't play cricket.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.800
You're trying to keep me from him.
I know my rights.

20:04.800 --> 20:07.200
You will spend
the night in the cells!

20:07.200 --> 20:09.040
I got salvage rights!

20:09.040 --> 20:10.280
What the hell's going on?!

20:10.280 --> 20:13.760
I just caught this old woman
pilfering whisky from my containers.

20:13.760 --> 20:15.360
Oi! Who are you calling old?

20:15.360 --> 20:18.120
Half the town are down there,
looting from my cargo.

20:18.120 --> 20:19.880
Profiting from my hard work.

20:19.880 --> 20:23.440
Profiteering? You're just shipping
coffee beans that some poor

20:23.440 --> 20:26.320
farmer from somewhere's paid
three pence a day to grow.

20:26.320 --> 20:27.720
Can I handle this, please?

20:27.720 --> 20:29.320
Well, I don't think that you can!

20:29.320 --> 20:32.440
This lot are too lazy to make their
own lives, so they just go round

20:32.440 --> 20:35.480
nicking from what's mine. You're
like all those bankers and fat cats,

20:35.480 --> 20:39.760
keeping the poor working man down.
Like Russell Booky Wooky says,

20:39.760 --> 20:42.640
I reckon we deserve some of the good
stuff. That's enough, Judith.

20:42.640 --> 20:44.280
Oi! Judith!

20:44.280 --> 20:46.120
CROWD CHANT: Judith! Judith!

20:46.120 --> 20:47.880
CHANTING CONTINUES

20:59.200 --> 21:02.440
Mr Brubaker? What's wrong?
There's a...brute snooping around.

21:02.440 --> 21:05.040
Who is he? Are you hurt?
If I were ten years younger...

21:05.040 --> 21:07.640
If you've been threatened,
we need to talk to Davey.

21:07.640 --> 21:10.960
Then I would've gone to see Davey!
Stop fussing.

21:10.960 --> 21:12.720
Do you want to sit down?

21:22.440 --> 21:23.600
Here.

21:25.920 --> 21:27.880
I saw him the other night.

21:27.880 --> 21:31.160
I don't sleep. Any noise gets me up.

21:31.160 --> 21:35.320
I saw him on the coastal path about
5:30, arguing with a woman.

21:35.320 --> 21:38.600
Did you recognise her?
She had her back to me.

21:38.600 --> 21:42.040
But she was wearing a brightly
coloured jacket. Like a jogger.

21:42.040 --> 21:43.640
There was a logo on the back.

21:43.640 --> 21:45.520
Do you know what sort of logo?

21:45.520 --> 21:48.640
A bird, I think.
My eyes aren't what they were.

21:48.640 --> 21:51.000
They were shouting something fierce.
They tussled.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.960
That's when he dropped the wallet.

21:52.960 --> 21:55.720
He ran off down the coastal path,
and she went after him.

21:55.720 --> 21:57.600
Why did you take the wallet?

21:57.600 --> 21:58.640
I don't know.

22:00.280 --> 22:03.440
Guess I wanted to take something
of his. Felt like justice.

22:06.120 --> 22:07.880
Thank you for this.

22:09.440 --> 22:11.440
Now let's get someone
to take a look at you.

22:14.360 --> 22:19.400
There you go.
Two ales, two shandy halves.

22:19.400 --> 22:21.240
I'll be with you in a sec, love.

22:21.240 --> 22:23.600
There you are!
It's pandemonium in there.

22:23.600 --> 22:26.240
You wouldn't believe the things
I've found washed up. Yeah?

22:26.240 --> 22:28.720
You better find some glass
and start doing some work,

22:28.720 --> 22:31.120
or you can find yourself
another barmaid, and all.

22:31.120 --> 22:33.040
Anything you say, my lovely.

22:35.720 --> 22:39.080
There's nothing of use in there, but
Brubaker's story begs the question -

22:39.080 --> 22:40.520
who was the mystery woman?

22:40.520 --> 22:44.560
If there was one. Oh, wait, I've got
something for you.

22:44.560 --> 22:45.920
Oh, yeah? Sorry.

22:48.920 --> 22:50.800
Yes. A thousand times, yes.

22:50.800 --> 22:54.760
Bloody ha, ha, ha.
No, it's Ian's ring from lock-up.

22:54.760 --> 22:56.360
If Abby is holding something back,

22:56.360 --> 22:58.360
I thought you could use it
for leverage?

22:58.360 --> 23:00.320
But you think Ian's guilty.

23:00.320 --> 23:02.280
I have been wrong before.

23:02.280 --> 23:03.920
Thanks.

23:03.920 --> 23:05.960
Of course, I need time to pick out a
dress.

23:05.960 --> 23:08.960
And then there's the catering...
As long as Mick don't do it.

23:08.960 --> 23:10.480
RADIO: 'Control to all units,

23:10.480 --> 23:12.840
'reported disturbance
at Black Dog pub.

23:12.840 --> 23:15.240
'Able to respond?' Speak of the
devil. 239 to control,

23:15.240 --> 23:17.280
received that, I'm on my way, over.

23:18.800 --> 23:20.600
I need to find this container.

23:20.600 --> 23:23.120
Mick! Hey! I'm DS Higgins.
What's going on?

23:23.120 --> 23:25.840
I ain't got a clue, Davey.
Don't make me ask you again.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.600
I'd love to help you,
but I don't speak gorilla.

23:29.600 --> 23:31.200
Oh, right, Mick, that's not helping.

23:31.200 --> 23:33.200
Can you take a step back for me,
please? I reckon

23:33.200 --> 23:35.920
he's just a bit overtired. Why don't
you take your nap now, boy?

23:35.920 --> 23:38.480
Tell me where it is!
All right, now that's not helping.

23:39.600 --> 23:41.040
Oh, sh...

23:55.560 --> 23:57.800
I knew he was going to ask.

23:57.800 --> 24:01.440
He kept dropping nervous hints,
checking I'd say yes.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.800
Abby, did you fight with Ian
that morning?

24:05.800 --> 24:07.560
Maybe follow him down here?

24:07.560 --> 24:09.760
No. No, he left when I was in bed.

24:09.760 --> 24:11.720
That was the last time I saw him.

24:11.720 --> 24:14.000
An eyewitness saw
Ian arguing with a woman,

24:14.000 --> 24:15.720
shortly before he died.

24:17.280 --> 24:18.800
A woman?

24:18.800 --> 24:20.840
It's a vague description,
but you match it.

24:20.840 --> 24:23.680
She was wearing a colourful
running jacket.

24:23.680 --> 24:25.440
That wasn't me.

24:28.040 --> 24:29.920
I'm such an idiot.

24:31.760 --> 24:34.000
He lied about his job,
about the looting.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.040
Now he's secretly meeting other
women?

24:37.040 --> 24:39.160
My dad was right.
We don't know that for sure.

24:39.160 --> 24:40.400
It's my own stupid fault.

24:40.400 --> 24:43.440
He kept promising he'd change,
I kept believing him.

24:44.600 --> 24:46.000
This is just another lie.

24:47.200 --> 24:48.720
Thank you.

24:48.720 --> 24:51.360
I wanted answers,
and now I've got them.

24:51.360 --> 24:53.960
I don't want to waste
a second more on him.

25:13.720 --> 25:14.760
Eh!

25:15.760 --> 25:17.520
Where you going with all that food?

25:19.000 --> 25:21.080
Well, it's lunch.

25:21.080 --> 25:23.480
Michael Sturrock,
what are you hiding?

25:33.160 --> 25:36.040
Right. It's been a long day,
so I'll cut to the chase.

25:36.040 --> 25:37.520
I know you want to talk.

25:37.520 --> 25:39.080
You know how I know this?

25:39.080 --> 25:41.680
Because you haven't asked
for a solicitor or a phone call.

25:41.680 --> 25:44.040
And whilst you're giving me
your hard-man stare,

25:44.040 --> 25:46.280
your foot's tapping
like you're Gene Kelly.

25:47.680 --> 25:50.760
Whatever you're fishing for,
you ain't going to get it.

25:52.080 --> 25:53.880
So there is something.

25:53.880 --> 25:57.040
Just lock me up or let me go.

25:57.040 --> 25:58.400
No.

25:58.400 --> 26:02.560
I think I'll take option three,
which is where I call your probation

26:02.560 --> 26:06.240
officer and have you put back
behind bars before my tea gets cold.

26:09.520 --> 26:12.360
Two years. That's not bad.

26:12.360 --> 26:14.320
I've been married a lot longer.

26:15.360 --> 26:17.320
Of course, you did assault Mick.

26:17.320 --> 26:19.440
Can't really blame you for that,

26:19.440 --> 26:22.520
but that should
add a couple more years.

26:22.520 --> 26:24.440
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

26:24.440 --> 26:27.800
And then there's assaulting a police
officer, resisting arrest.

26:27.800 --> 26:29.120
You know what?

26:29.120 --> 26:32.000
I think the judge will round it up
to a nice even ten.

26:34.240 --> 26:35.920
Wait!

26:37.840 --> 26:41.040
Don't call the parole officer.
I can't go back, all right?

26:45.200 --> 26:47.800
I'm looking for a cargo container.

26:49.760 --> 26:51.400
The one you texted Ian?

26:53.480 --> 26:56.040
Was he in on the smuggling
operation?

26:56.040 --> 26:58.240
We had to find it before it
was too late.

26:58.240 --> 26:59.600
Too late for what?

26:59.600 --> 27:01.840
I... I can't say!

27:01.840 --> 27:05.200
OK. I'm going to make that call.

27:05.200 --> 27:07.360
Don't do it!
Then tell me the truth!

27:12.160 --> 27:15.040
The cargo. In the container.

27:16.800 --> 27:19.120
They're people. Refugees.

27:22.360 --> 27:26.640
You mean to tell me there are people
trapped in one of those containers?

27:26.640 --> 27:29.560
If you let me go,
I can find them, I know it.

27:32.120 --> 27:34.080
Stop... Wait!

27:34.080 --> 27:36.120
I can't go back! Please!

27:37.160 --> 27:40.280
Get on the horn to the coastguard,
the navy - anyone with a boat.

27:40.280 --> 27:42.720
I want people out
scouring those coves.

27:42.720 --> 27:45.360
Derek, call Search and Rescue,
will you?

27:45.360 --> 27:47.800
I want that chopper up in the air.
OK. I can't believe this.

27:47.800 --> 27:50.320
They've been missing two days.
Why didn't he say anything?

27:50.320 --> 27:54.080
Later. Right now we've got
60 miles of coastline to search.

27:54.080 --> 27:56.920
Tam, can you get onto our friends
at Dartmouth, please?

27:56.920 --> 27:59.320
I want all hands on deck
on this one.

27:59.320 --> 28:02.560
Do you think there's a chance
they're still alive? I hope so.

28:12.720 --> 28:15.440
Mum? Mick? Are you in there?

28:21.080 --> 28:23.560
Mum? Open up, it's important.

28:24.560 --> 28:28.760
Yes, dear? Don't... Shh!
You're in enough trouble already!

28:28.760 --> 28:30.840
What's wrong?
There's some people missing,

28:30.840 --> 28:32.400
trapped, in one of the containers.

28:32.400 --> 28:35.040
Mick knows the coast better than
most. I thought he might help.

28:35.040 --> 28:38.440
Do you hear that, Mick?
People missing, Jane says.

28:38.440 --> 28:40.800
They need your help.
Oh, for goodness' sake...

28:40.800 --> 28:43.400
I think Mick has
something to tell you.

28:47.040 --> 28:48.560
I didn't know this was here.

28:48.560 --> 28:49.960
Yep. Use it for storage.

28:49.960 --> 28:52.960
You know, keep bits and bobs
I don't want cluttering up the pub.

28:52.960 --> 28:56.120
Bits and bobs, eh?
I'll remember that.

28:56.120 --> 29:00.600
Now...try to resist the urge
to arrest me, all right?

29:03.880 --> 29:07.040
Don't panic, don't panic.
It's OK. Don't panic.

29:07.040 --> 29:08.280
They're friends...

29:08.280 --> 29:09.440
PEOPLE MURMUR

29:09.440 --> 29:10.720
..sort of.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.800
Mick?! I know. It was a bit of a
shock when I found them.

29:16.800 --> 29:19.240
But I got them blankets,
food, drink.

29:19.240 --> 29:21.080
Have you contacted the authorities?

29:21.080 --> 29:23.480
Hey? I've never dobbed
anyone in my life!

29:23.480 --> 29:25.520
I ain't going to start now
with this lot.

29:25.520 --> 29:28.040
Have you talked to them?
Do any of them speak English?

29:28.040 --> 29:30.720
Better than I speak Arabic,
that's for sure.

29:30.720 --> 29:32.680
That chap there's a doctor, I think,

29:32.680 --> 29:34.920
and the rest of them
are farmers, mainly.

29:34.920 --> 29:36.160
Mick, why didn't you tell me?

29:36.160 --> 29:38.800
I've got this massive search
and rescue operation going on!

29:38.800 --> 29:42.040
Yeah, and what would you have done?
Hand them straight to Border Force,

29:42.040 --> 29:44.960
I expect. Then they'd've been sent
back home. And you're planning on

29:44.960 --> 29:47.440
keeping them here for ever, are you?
Mick's tree-house

29:47.440 --> 29:49.080
in Never Never Land?
No, I got a plan!

29:49.080 --> 29:53.400
I called a charity that
asks for asylum for people.

29:53.400 --> 29:57.440
They'll be here in a couple of
hours. Oh, no. These are illegal
immigrants. I have to report this.

29:57.440 --> 30:00.840
Right, and then they just get sent
back to the country they've just
escaped from.

30:00.840 --> 30:04.760
And I'm sorry about that, but my
bosses take this seriously. This is
well above my pay-grade.

30:04.760 --> 30:06.440
Yeah, we got rules here and all.

30:06.440 --> 30:08.720
This is a safe harbour
for ships in distress.

30:08.720 --> 30:12.440
Always has been.
These people are under my roof now.

30:12.440 --> 30:16.280
Davey,
they nearly died trying to get here.

30:16.280 --> 30:17.560
Yeah, I know that.

30:17.560 --> 30:21.120
This charity only needs a few hours
to get their ducks in a row,

30:21.120 --> 30:23.800
then this sorry lot has a chance.

30:28.560 --> 30:31.120
All right, I'll hold off
reporting this until

30:31.120 --> 30:33.920
they've had a chance
to do their thing, all right?

30:33.920 --> 30:36.760
But, for heaven's sake, get a decent
meal inside 'em, will you?

30:36.760 --> 30:39.240
Mick's burgers are enough to make
anyone want to throw

30:39.240 --> 30:41.720
themselves back in the sea.
Oh, very nice.

30:42.920 --> 30:46.160
Everything's going to be all right,
promise. All right?

30:46.160 --> 30:47.760
All right. Keep quiet.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.240
I'm not stopping.

31:10.240 --> 31:13.240
Have you seen what number seven's
doing? Strutting around like that.

31:13.240 --> 31:14.680
It's shameless.

31:14.680 --> 31:16.800
Gran, this one's mine.
Why's it in your wardrobe?

31:16.800 --> 31:20.000
No, no, that one, that's for me.
I gave you that lovely dress.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.520
Which one's more me?
Black leather or girlie flowers?

31:22.520 --> 31:25.040
It's nice to come home
and relax after a hard day.

31:25.040 --> 31:26.120
Mum, she took my jacket!

31:26.120 --> 31:28.560
Look, I'm sure there's plenty for
both of you. Make-up,

31:28.560 --> 31:32.040
designer clothes, Greek statues. It's
like the duty-free lounge of Olympus.

31:32.040 --> 31:34.520
Exactly. There's plenty of clothes
for you, young lady.

31:34.520 --> 31:36.840
Respect your elders. Then act your
age, Madonna. Oi!

31:36.840 --> 31:39.840
How was your day, Jane? Well, I just
got back from rescuing

31:39.840 --> 31:44.000
a dozen refugees who travelled
halfway across the world
in a 20x8-foot steel box.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.560
I helped with that. A bit.

31:45.560 --> 31:47.960
Washed up, just the clothes
on their back.

31:49.080 --> 31:51.240
I don't really need this.

31:54.760 --> 31:57.080
Brubaker said there was
a logo on the jacket.

31:57.080 --> 31:59.000
Who said what now?

31:59.000 --> 32:03.080
The griffin - eagle's head.
I should've thought of it sooner.

32:03.080 --> 32:04.240
Thanks!

32:06.200 --> 32:07.440
Thanks for coming out here.

32:08.360 --> 32:10.320
You row, don't you? Yes.

32:10.320 --> 32:11.840
Is that your team jacket?

32:11.840 --> 32:14.320
The Plymouth Griffins.

32:14.320 --> 32:17.280
I ask because a witness saw Ian
arguing with a woman,

32:17.280 --> 32:18.880
right here, just before he died.

32:18.880 --> 32:21.080
The description
has your jacket down to a T.

32:22.200 --> 32:25.400
What? You think it was me?
That's ridiculous.

32:25.400 --> 32:27.040
Not if it's true.

32:31.160 --> 32:32.920
Look...I can't talk about it.

32:32.920 --> 32:35.120
Andrea, you look like you
haven't slept in days.

32:35.120 --> 32:36.560
You can talk to me.

32:38.240 --> 32:40.080
Ian and I, we were...

32:41.760 --> 32:44.520
In my line of work,
you don't meet very many good men.

32:44.520 --> 32:47.680
Just exciting ones.
My marriage is...

32:47.680 --> 32:49.560
You were having an affair?

32:51.720 --> 32:54.400
The whole cliche.
Hotel rooms, dirty phone calls.

32:54.400 --> 32:55.760
All that rubbish.

32:56.960 --> 32:59.720
Then I found out about
the human trafficking.

32:59.720 --> 33:01.120
I wish I hadn't.

33:01.120 --> 33:03.840
So I followed him here,
tried to talk some sense into him.

33:03.840 --> 33:05.680
You could've told me this earlier.

33:05.680 --> 33:07.840
I didn't want to lose my job.

33:07.840 --> 33:10.400
Rule number one -
don't date the ex-cons.

33:10.400 --> 33:13.200
Rule number two being what?
Keep quiet while innocent people

33:13.200 --> 33:15.400
are trapped in a giant,
steel coffin somewhere?

33:17.720 --> 33:20.640
Ian might not have had a choice,
you know. Those trafficking gangs -

33:20.640 --> 33:23.360
they're a different breed.
What if he was scared?

33:23.360 --> 33:25.520
Scared of what they'd do to him
if he messed up.

33:25.520 --> 33:28.800
Maybe he should've thought about that
before jumping into bed with them.

33:33.160 --> 33:36.400
Andrea was a dead-end.
We need to talk to Hess again.

33:36.400 --> 33:39.040
No chance. He's surrounded
by his defence barristers.

33:39.040 --> 33:42.880
300 quid for a pair of shoes' types,
courtesy of Mr Naseby.

33:42.880 --> 33:45.000
I'm just protecting my employee.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.200
Mr Hess is in a vulnerable state.

33:47.200 --> 33:50.240
I don't want him manipulated into
bringing my company into disrepute.

33:50.240 --> 33:54.320
You do realise this makes you
look like you're trying to cover up
your involvement in smuggling?

33:54.320 --> 33:58.080
That's exactly the sort of misguided
accusation that I'm here to avoid.

33:58.080 --> 33:59.840
He's got a point, though, hasn't he?

33:59.840 --> 34:01.760
Trafficking gangs are pretty
dangerous.

34:01.760 --> 34:04.440
I don't think I'd want any links
to them being made public.

34:04.440 --> 34:06.640
Can you imagine what happens to
those who fail them?

34:06.640 --> 34:09.040
What? Like losing
a cargo of people, you mean?

34:09.040 --> 34:10.760
Another slur like that, sergeant,

34:10.760 --> 34:13.800
and you'll need a lawyer
of your own. He has one.

34:15.560 --> 34:19.080
My people are expediting
the bail process as we speak.

34:19.080 --> 34:21.800
Mr Hess will be out
by the end of the day.

34:21.800 --> 34:23.440
Afternoon.

34:32.760 --> 34:34.719
So, what happened on the beach?

34:37.239 --> 34:40.560
Did you go down there to steal
for Abby? Or to cheat on her?

34:42.320 --> 34:44.520
Or to find your missing cargo?

34:47.920 --> 34:49.520
See, I want to like you.

34:51.239 --> 34:53.800
Send you off with some dignity.

34:53.800 --> 34:56.440
But you're not giving me
much to go on, are you?

35:09.240 --> 35:11.760
OK. One more chance.

35:28.880 --> 35:30.560
More like it, isn't it?

35:30.560 --> 35:33.080
I suspect you'll get in a lot
of trouble with your bosses

35:33.080 --> 35:36.040
if they find out you've been helping
shelter illegal refugees.

35:36.040 --> 35:38.240
I'll just blame you.
Say you're a bad influence.

35:38.240 --> 35:40.480
Speaking of which,
I want to see Brent.

35:40.480 --> 35:42.160
No can do, I'm afraid.

35:42.160 --> 35:44.520
I've got Naseby's shysters camped
out at the station,

35:44.520 --> 35:46.600
running the clock down
until Brent's released.

35:46.600 --> 35:49.440
He seemed genuinely concerned
about these people.

35:49.440 --> 35:52.480
You think you can get him to talk?
Will you let me try?

35:52.480 --> 35:55.560
Come on, then. Like I said.
Bad influence.

36:04.280 --> 36:05.920
I'll just be a minute.

36:16.720 --> 36:20.760
What the...?! Fancy running into you
here. Listen, we found them.

36:20.760 --> 36:23.760
All the refugees, they're safe and
sound. Thank God.

36:23.760 --> 36:26.720
We don't have much time. I don't want
to bury Ian as a villain.

36:26.720 --> 36:29.600
I think he's worth more than that,
and I think you are, too.

36:29.600 --> 36:31.720
He was. OK, so tell me.

36:31.720 --> 36:34.520
When he got out,
he was dead set on going straight.

36:34.520 --> 36:37.080
For his girl.
So he wasn't a smuggler?

36:37.080 --> 36:39.680
No. He stayed legit.

36:39.680 --> 36:42.120
I was the one that
ballsed it all up.

36:42.120 --> 36:44.680
So what happened on the beach?
What was he doing there?

36:44.680 --> 36:45.760
I... I can't. Come on!

36:45.760 --> 36:48.680
Do you want his girlfriend thinking
he was a slave trader?

36:48.680 --> 36:50.320
BANG ON DOOR

36:53.040 --> 36:55.680
If I talk, my boss puts me away.

36:55.680 --> 36:57.880
You haven't a clue what
it's like in there!

36:57.880 --> 37:00.560
I promise you I will do everything
I can to help you.

37:00.560 --> 37:02.640
What can you do?
You're just a coroner.

37:02.640 --> 37:05.240
It means I get the last word on Ian.

37:05.240 --> 37:07.600
What do you want that to be?

37:09.640 --> 37:11.000
I'm out.

37:12.160 --> 37:13.720
I kept quiet!

37:14.720 --> 37:16.320
I know where the cargo is.

37:17.640 --> 37:20.360
You can still have your goods,
but we don't have long.

37:42.600 --> 37:46.480
Were you followed?
I don't think so.

37:46.480 --> 37:48.200
Where are they?

37:48.200 --> 37:49.920
Over there.

37:49.920 --> 37:52.120
They're in the village pub?

37:52.120 --> 37:56.520
I thought you meant they were still
locked up. How the hell are we
supposed to get to them?

37:56.520 --> 37:59.280
You haven't got a clue, do you?

37:59.280 --> 38:03.840
The people I work for -
we work for - are killers.

38:03.840 --> 38:06.600
And the minute there's a problem,
they'll close the loop.

38:06.600 --> 38:09.360
And now we are the problem
because of you!

38:11.160 --> 38:14.360
Who's that?
You were followed, you fool!

38:23.840 --> 38:25.600
Miss Matteo.

38:25.600 --> 38:27.880
Just when I think I've seen
the worst of human nature,

38:27.880 --> 38:30.360
someone like you comes along
and proves me wrong.

38:30.360 --> 38:33.840
I thought... Oh, thank goodness.

38:33.840 --> 38:35.200
Don't thank me.

38:35.200 --> 38:37.520
You're going to spend
a long time in a small box.

38:37.520 --> 38:40.280
But don't worry. It'll be a darn
site more comfortable than

38:40.280 --> 38:41.920
the one you locked those people in.

38:47.520 --> 38:50.960
The coroner will be sitting in on
this, as this relates to her case.

38:52.400 --> 38:54.560
If you want
protection from the gangs,

38:54.560 --> 38:56.240
I suggest you tell us everything.

38:58.160 --> 38:59.640
I didn't mean to kill him.

38:59.640 --> 39:01.000
You mean your lover?

39:02.120 --> 39:05.520
I'm sorry I lied about that.
I was scared.

39:05.520 --> 39:06.960
I still am.

39:06.960 --> 39:08.200
Scared of who?

39:08.200 --> 39:09.560
The traffickers.

39:12.240 --> 39:14.000
I'm just a middleman.

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
They have the money.
I have access to ex-cons

39:17.000 --> 39:18.680
that I can manipulate, like Hess,

39:18.680 --> 39:21.240
and jobs in the port
I can put them in.

39:21.240 --> 39:23.800
The night the boat capsized,
Brent called me.

39:23.800 --> 39:26.240
Said he was worried
about the refugees drowning,

39:26.240 --> 39:29.200
wanted to go save them.
I told him no, but he went anyway.

39:30.560 --> 39:35.720
'I had to stop the idiot before
he got us locked up, or worse.'

39:35.720 --> 39:38.400
So you left those refugees
there to die?

39:38.400 --> 39:40.320
I left it to fate.

39:42.920 --> 39:45.240
When I got to Lighthaven,
I found Ian.

39:45.240 --> 39:47.440
Brent had called him,
told him everything,

39:47.440 --> 39:49.920
and he'd run out at five
in the morning to help his friend.

39:51.320 --> 39:54.000
He hadn't called your lot
straightaway, so I guess he didn't

39:54.000 --> 39:56.560
believe what he was hearing,
until he saw me standing there.

39:56.560 --> 39:58.360
Ian, wait! Wait!

39:58.360 --> 40:01.760
'We had a row.
He wouldn't listen to me.

40:03.440 --> 40:06.280
'He wanted to wake everyone up,
and start a search.

40:06.280 --> 40:09.360
'I kept telling him that these
traffickers want their privacy.

40:09.360 --> 40:11.880
'And it's better that
the refugees don't turn up,

40:11.880 --> 40:13.960
'or it'll be us that disappears.'

40:15.200 --> 40:17.160
'What happened on the beach?'

40:18.160 --> 40:19.760
He went looking for Brent.

40:19.760 --> 40:24.040
'I followed him, pleading.
He wouldn't listen.'

40:24.040 --> 40:26.240
Started dialling on his phone. I...

40:26.240 --> 40:28.160
I panicked.

40:28.160 --> 40:31.200
There were these hard-case boxes
spilling out of a container.

40:31.200 --> 40:32.840
'I picked one up and...

40:32.840 --> 40:34.120
'I didn't mean to...

40:40.600 --> 40:43.640
'I made it look like a box had
fallen and hit him.

40:43.640 --> 40:45.160
'And the tide was coming in fast.

40:45.160 --> 40:47.240
'I thought it would wash away
the evidence.

40:47.240 --> 40:50.760
'And of course no-one would look
closely at a lifelong criminal

40:50.760 --> 40:53.240
'falling back on old habits, right?'

40:53.240 --> 40:56.520
And if the refugees were discovered,
Ian was the perfect person

40:56.520 --> 40:59.440
to take the blame -
someone who could never answer back.

41:15.920 --> 41:17.680
DOORBELL RINGS

41:24.640 --> 41:27.880
Oh. Hello, Davey. Looking for Jane?

41:27.880 --> 41:30.440
Mrs Kennedy, this is Mrs Slithe,

41:30.440 --> 41:33.320
she is the legal representative
from the Maritime Authority.

41:33.320 --> 41:36.640
And she is here to collect
all items recently salvaged.

41:37.760 --> 41:39.320
Oh. Hello.

41:39.320 --> 41:42.840
As mentioned, any salvage not
reported shall be considered theft.

41:42.840 --> 41:44.960
And the perpetrators will be
prosecuted

41:44.960 --> 41:46.640
to the full extent of the law.

41:46.640 --> 41:49.760
Theft, you say?
My goodness. The thing is...

41:49.760 --> 41:52.200
But as I was saying to
Mrs Slithe here,

41:52.200 --> 41:55.120
you were just merely holding on to
these things for safe-keeping.

41:55.120 --> 41:56.600
What?

41:56.600 --> 41:59.840
Oh, yeah, that's right. Anything to
help. See, Judith isn't the type

41:59.840 --> 42:02.800
of person that would take something
that doesn't belong to her.

42:02.800 --> 42:05.080
Are you Judith?
Oh, heavens, no. No.

42:05.080 --> 42:08.000
I mean, only a complete idiot
would think you'd get away with

42:08.000 --> 42:09.440
something like that.

42:09.440 --> 42:10.760
Yes, they would.

42:10.760 --> 42:11.960
All right, then.

42:11.960 --> 42:14.440
Me and Jim here will help you
carry the stuff out.

42:14.440 --> 42:15.960
All right?

42:15.960 --> 42:17.320
Davey.

42:18.520 --> 42:19.560
Jim.

42:20.920 --> 42:22.200
Mrs Slithe.

42:25.800 --> 42:28.040
After all that...

42:28.040 --> 42:29.840
he never lied to me.

42:32.240 --> 42:34.080
This belongs to you.

42:38.560 --> 42:42.320
All those terrible things
people said he'd done.

42:42.320 --> 42:44.120
I almost believed them.

42:44.120 --> 42:48.160
I had my doubts, too,
but I found this in his wallet.

42:49.640 --> 42:53.520
It's a receipt for the ring,
bought and paid for.

42:55.080 --> 42:56.840
He never lied to you.

42:58.280 --> 42:59.880
Oh, Ian.

43:48.600 --> 43:50.880
All rise for Her Majesty's Coroner.
