WEBVTT

00:04.869 --> 00:05.869
Bye, Mike.

00:05.913 --> 00:06.695
[rifles firing]

00:09.086 --> 00:12.043
Ziva, I have to work
outside the country.For how long?

00:13.521 --> 00:15.217
Levin.

00:15.260 --> 00:17.478
BARRETT: Before Dr. Mallard
begins the autopsy,

00:17.521 --> 00:19.043
I'd like a moment
to pay my respects.

00:19.086 --> 00:20.695
I'm giving my resignation
to the president

00:20.739 --> 00:22.043
as soon as this is over.

00:22.086 --> 00:24.869
Dr. Vance, I'm authorizing
Agent DiNozzo access

00:24.913 --> 00:26.956
to sensitive,
compartmented information.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.173
None of your other team members
need to know. Is that clear?

00:29.217 --> 00:30.478
Actually, Clay,
I'm a little concerned.

00:30.521 --> 00:32.608
"Secretary Jarvis"
when we're talking shop.

00:32.652 --> 00:33.652
Take a look.

00:35.173 --> 00:37.173
That's who
you're handling.

00:41.347 --> 00:43.565
Hey, I came as soon
as I could.

00:43.608 --> 00:45.260
Yeah, sorry it's late.

00:45.304 --> 00:46.826
Status?

00:46.869 --> 00:48.173
He was found unconscious.

00:48.217 --> 00:50.652
Single gunshot wound to
the chest, concussion.

00:50.695 --> 00:52.391
I assume he defended himself.

00:52.434 --> 00:53.869
Got off two rounds.

00:53.913 --> 00:55.478
So he shot the son of a bitch?

00:55.521 --> 00:56.695
Maybe.

00:56.739 --> 00:58.956
What does "maybe" mean?Maybe means maybe.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.652
There was a lot
of blood left behind.

01:00.695 --> 01:01.913
The shooter's body was gone.

01:01.956 --> 01:04.347
You want me to
talk to him?
Yeah.

01:04.391 --> 01:07.043
Gibbs, not that I don't love a
good monosyllabic conversation.

01:07.086 --> 01:08.608
It's oddly endearing.

01:08.652 --> 01:11.000
It's just that it's after
midnight, I'm a little fuzzy.

01:11.043 --> 01:13.043
Talk to him about what?

01:13.086 --> 01:15.043
You're the doc, Doc.

01:15.086 --> 01:17.260
I got you some coffee.

01:23.043 --> 01:29.043
Ah. Dr. Kate's, uh...
sister, huh?

01:29.086 --> 01:31.086
Surprise, surprise.
What are you doing here?

01:31.130 --> 01:33.217
Can I get you something
from the bar?

01:33.260 --> 01:35.956
Little, uh, appletini,
or lime Jell-O shots?

01:36.000 --> 01:37.173
Those are good.

01:37.217 --> 01:39.000
Well, it's good
to see you haven't lost

01:39.043 --> 01:41.478
your sense of humor,
Agent DiNozzo.
[wry chuckle]

01:41.521 --> 01:43.565
I thought you said
he was shot.
Yeah.

01:43.608 --> 01:46.826
I didn't say they
were successful.

01:46.869 --> 01:48.869
I'm gonna let
you two talk.

01:48.913 --> 01:51.086
DiNozzo, I'll get
your clothes.

01:51.130 --> 01:52.565
Thank you, boss.

01:53.608 --> 01:56.565
So, you're okay?

01:56.608 --> 01:59.260
I'm not dead.

01:59.304 --> 02:02.478
Looks like
the vest saved your life.

02:02.521 --> 02:04.478
You could say
I'm well-invested.

02:04.521 --> 02:06.478
Invest we trust.
[nervous chuckle]

02:06.521 --> 02:08.826
Go vest, young man.
[wry laugh]

02:08.869 --> 02:11.826
You fired two rounds
from your gun.

02:11.869 --> 02:15.086
Casings were recovered,
slugs weren't.

02:15.130 --> 02:16.782
There was blood
at the scene, but

02:16.826 --> 02:19.043
no body.

02:19.086 --> 02:21.782
I ain't got nobody.

02:21.826 --> 02:23.173
Are you done?

02:23.217 --> 02:25.478
Done with what?

02:25.521 --> 02:26.956
The nervous responses.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
[sighs]

02:32.043 --> 02:34.956
I guess I'm a little...
rattled.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.913
Acknowledgment is
the first step to recovery.

02:38.956 --> 02:40.869
We're making some progress.

02:40.913 --> 02:44.347
So, who'd you shoot,
Agent DiNozzo?

02:44.391 --> 02:47.000
[door opens]

02:50.173 --> 02:51.565
You got pizza, boss?

02:54.652 --> 02:56.000
Something wrong?

03:02.956 --> 03:04.043
It's not yours.

03:08.913 --> 03:12.086
You shot another NCIS agent?

03:12.130 --> 03:14.304
I... uh...

03:16.521 --> 03:18.652
I need your help.

03:18.695 --> 03:22.043
I don't know. I...

03:22.086 --> 03:24.043
can't remember any of it.

03:57.173 --> 03:59.043
Sure you should be
walking around, DiNozzo?

03:59.086 --> 04:01.000
He hasn't stopped fidgeting
since I got here.

04:01.043 --> 04:04.043
I do have some stuff on my mind.

04:04.086 --> 04:05.565
There's an epiphany.

04:05.608 --> 04:08.391
[sighs]
I remember...

04:08.434 --> 04:10.391
I had orders.

04:10.434 --> 04:12.217
From whom?

04:13.913 --> 04:15.000
[whispers]:
SECNAV.

04:15.043 --> 04:16.434
I didn't ask you.

04:16.478 --> 04:18.000
I'm trying to help here.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.652
You can't remember
who the badge belongs to?

04:22.695 --> 04:24.826
[sighs heavily]

04:26.173 --> 04:28.043
I have no idea.

04:28.086 --> 04:30.304
Is the rest of your team
accounted for, Gibbs?

04:30.347 --> 04:32.043
GIBBS: It's the middle
of the night.

04:32.086 --> 04:33.304
I'm still waiting
for answers.

04:33.347 --> 04:34.956
You discharged your
weapon at someone, Tony.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.652
That's not to be
taken lightly.

04:36.695 --> 04:38.000
Who was it?

04:38.043 --> 04:40.869
I'd tell you if I could.

04:43.565 --> 04:46.043
He's blocked it.

04:46.086 --> 04:47.260
Short-term memory loss

04:47.304 --> 04:49.000
is a protective
response to trauma.

04:49.043 --> 04:51.347
We know Agent DiNozzo

04:51.391 --> 04:53.043
has killed before,

04:53.086 --> 04:55.434
but if he ended the life
of another NCIS agent,

04:55.478 --> 04:58.913
someone close, in addition
to the concussion,

04:58.956 --> 05:00.652
that would explain the lapse.

05:00.695 --> 05:01.956
It's temporary.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.478
Most likely.

05:03.521 --> 05:05.739
TONY:
Sorry, boss. I...

05:05.782 --> 05:07.695
was following orders.

05:07.739 --> 05:09.043
Not following my orders.

05:09.086 --> 05:11.043
That's not
fair, Gibbs.
It's the truth.

05:11.086 --> 05:15.000
You know, Agent DiNozzo and
I need a little time alone.

05:15.043 --> 05:16.434
Would you mind?

05:16.478 --> 05:20.086
Hey, knock yourself out.

05:22.043 --> 05:24.521
GIBBS:
No pun intended.

05:24.565 --> 05:26.956
[door closes]

05:28.956 --> 05:31.347
Okay, now, where were we?

05:31.391 --> 05:35.260
Tell me about
your assignment.

05:35.304 --> 05:38.043
From the beginning.

05:42.086 --> 05:43.739
[grunts]
Next up
on number one.

05:43.782 --> 05:45.391
You ever play golf
before, DiNozzo?

05:45.434 --> 05:48.086
[laughs]
Of course, Mr. Secretary.

05:48.130 --> 05:49.956
Yeah, you know,
as a kid with my...

05:50.000 --> 05:51.434
with my father, on holiday.

05:51.478 --> 05:52.565
That explains a lot.

05:53.782 --> 05:55.869
It's a game about patience.

05:55.913 --> 05:58.086
Taking every element
into account.

05:58.130 --> 06:01.478
Just when you think
you're in control, you're not.

06:01.521 --> 06:03.956
Are we gonna talk in metaphor
for the rest of the round, sir?

06:04.000 --> 06:05.695
'Cause, if so, I'm gonna need
a few more beers.

06:05.739 --> 06:06.913
[laughs]

06:06.956 --> 06:08.217
You shoot from the hip.

06:08.260 --> 06:10.043
You know, it's
part of the reason

06:10.086 --> 06:11.304
I chose you for
this assignment.

06:11.347 --> 06:13.695
What's the other part?

06:13.739 --> 06:16.000
You know what it takes
to be a good agent.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.478
You don't mind getting
your hands dirty.

06:17.521 --> 06:19.956
In that respect, NCIS
has been good for you.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.521
Been?

06:21.565 --> 06:24.304
Well, no disrespect to
Director Vance or Agent Gibbs,

06:24.347 --> 06:26.304
but we have a situation,

06:26.347 --> 06:29.000
and it's ourjob
to deal with it.

06:29.043 --> 06:31.956
Well, I'm sure the rest of
the team could be helpful, sir.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.782
I didn't ask the rest
of the team, DiNozzo.

06:34.826 --> 06:36.826
I asked you.

06:42.043 --> 06:44.000
You saw the photo.

06:44.043 --> 06:46.043
You know who the problem is.

06:46.086 --> 06:47.521
Make it happen.

06:50.347 --> 06:52.956
And did the rest of
your team suspect

06:53.000 --> 06:54.956
that you were on a
secret assignment?

06:55.000 --> 06:57.391
TONY:
No, not at first.

06:57.434 --> 07:00.260
Just business as usual.

07:01.608 --> 07:03.695
McGEE:
Another e-mail to Ray?

07:03.739 --> 07:06.608
I know he's on a classified
mission and that he is busy.

07:06.652 --> 07:08.956
I also know
that if he reads an e-mail,

07:09.000 --> 07:10.565
it could risk disclosing
his location.

07:10.608 --> 07:12.391
But?
But...

07:12.434 --> 07:14.391
just because I write them does
not mean he has to read them.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.478
Unless he's on a secure system.

07:16.521 --> 07:17.782
Then they will,

07:17.826 --> 07:19.043
perhaps, make him smile.

07:19.086 --> 07:20.434
I think I got something else

07:20.478 --> 07:21.826
that's gonna
make you smile, "Ziver."

07:21.869 --> 07:23.173
[gasps]

07:23.217 --> 07:25.652
Congratulations.

07:25.695 --> 07:27.000
You're now a
journeyman agent.

07:27.043 --> 07:28.652
My probation is officially over?

07:28.695 --> 07:30.000
Done and done.

07:30.043 --> 07:31.826
Congrats, Special Agent David.

07:31.869 --> 07:36.000
I will carry this
with tremendous pride.

07:36.043 --> 07:38.173
Carry what? Ray's stones
in a Mason jar?

07:38.217 --> 07:40.217
Aw, probie no more.

07:40.260 --> 07:42.434
Good for you.

07:42.478 --> 07:44.217
Who am I gonna pick on now?

07:44.260 --> 07:46.826
I'm sure you will find something
else to pick on me about.

07:46.869 --> 07:50.043
In the meantime, Tony,
we are now equals.

07:50.086 --> 07:51.608
Equals, huh?

07:51.652 --> 07:53.043
Careful what you ask for.

07:53.086 --> 07:55.782
Tonight we should all go out
and celebrate.

07:55.826 --> 07:57.086
You mean a wetting down?

07:57.130 --> 07:58.695
No, there is no wedding.

07:58.739 --> 08:01.000
I mean, Palmer's not getting
married till next spring.

08:01.043 --> 08:03.565
It's called a
"wetting down," David.

08:03.608 --> 08:05.086
Means you're paying.

08:05.130 --> 08:07.130
Oh, then we should go
somewhere fun.

08:07.173 --> 08:09.043
McGEE:
I know a fun gaming lounge.

08:09.086 --> 08:11.000
3-D PS2 on a 60-inch plasma.

08:14.086 --> 08:15.130
Or not.

08:16.695 --> 08:18.565
And what do you think, Tony?

08:18.608 --> 08:20.086
I think I'll take a rain check.

08:20.130 --> 08:21.130
I've got some homework to do.

08:21.173 --> 08:22.956
But, uh, you have
some fun, David.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.478
You've earned it.

08:36.521 --> 08:38.521
How's your vision, DiNozzo?

08:38.565 --> 08:39.956
20-20, boss.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.652
Why?

08:42.695 --> 08:45.304
Oh, Vance tells me
Jarvis needs your help.

08:46.913 --> 08:48.869
Better keep your eyes open.

08:48.913 --> 08:50.478
Back of my head,
as always, boss.

08:50.521 --> 08:51.695
Learned from the best.

08:51.739 --> 08:52.913
You haven't
learned everything.

08:52.956 --> 08:54.217
I'd have told him
to forget it.

08:54.260 --> 08:55.565
What do you know
about Jarvis?

08:55.608 --> 08:58.739
Smart. Seems like
he means business.

08:58.782 --> 09:01.086
You trust him?

09:01.130 --> 09:03.043
Don't we have to?

09:05.086 --> 09:07.434
You know, I became a cop

09:07.478 --> 09:09.608
because I thought
the lines were clear--

09:09.652 --> 09:11.347
good and bad,

09:11.391 --> 09:13.956
right and wrong.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.043
Let me guess:
The lines blur?

09:16.086 --> 09:18.043
Funny how that happens.

09:19.217 --> 09:21.130
You gonna tell me
what's on your mind?

09:23.086 --> 09:24.739
Just doing my job, boss.

09:24.782 --> 09:26.608
MAN [over P.A.]: Shooters,
you may commence firing.

09:26.652 --> 09:28.434
[guns firing]

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Just doing my job.

09:55.043 --> 09:58.217
Walk me through what happened
from the end of May to now.

09:58.260 --> 09:59.782
Hmm.

09:59.826 --> 10:02.695
I was given an order
to handle a situation.

10:02.739 --> 10:05.304
And by "handle,"
you mean kill someone?

10:06.391 --> 10:08.347
If it came down to that, yeah.

10:08.391 --> 10:10.739
Taking a life is lot
of responsibility.

10:10.782 --> 10:12.869
Do you consider yourself
an accountable person?

10:12.913 --> 10:14.521
[sighs]

10:14.565 --> 10:15.956
Very.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.217
And yet, this
happened.

10:17.260 --> 10:19.608
How did the order
present itself?

10:19.652 --> 10:21.521
Through a...

10:21.565 --> 10:23.086
Through a photograph.

10:23.130 --> 10:24.739
Of whom?

10:24.782 --> 10:27.869
Well, sweetheart,
if I could remember that,

10:27.913 --> 10:29.869
we wouldn't be here, would we?

10:29.913 --> 10:31.391
I'm not your sweetheart.
Try harder.

10:31.434 --> 10:33.826
[firmly]:
I am trying.

10:33.869 --> 10:36.608
I know there's probably
something you're not mentioning.

10:36.652 --> 10:38.521
Try again, Tony.

10:38.565 --> 10:40.130
I know you can.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.869
You don't know anything
about me.

10:41.913 --> 10:43.608
Oh, actually,
I know quite a lot.

10:43.652 --> 10:50.391
From Kate...
to Jeanne Benoit

10:50.434 --> 10:54.565
to the complexities of your
relationship with Agent David.

10:54.608 --> 10:55.913
Don't think I had forgotten

10:55.956 --> 10:58.217
about that kid in
Baltimore, either.

11:01.391 --> 11:03.695
I need to know what I did.

11:03.739 --> 11:05.739
Then let's start
with the photo.

11:06.739 --> 11:08.652
I des...

11:08.695 --> 11:10.478
I destroyed it.

11:14.739 --> 11:17.347
Destroying more pictures from
your dirty collection, Tony?

11:17.391 --> 11:19.869
Well, Miss Shiny New
Badge of Courage,

11:19.913 --> 11:21.478
the answer to
that is no.

11:21.521 --> 11:23.478
Unlike you, flashing
your new badge

11:23.521 --> 11:25.391
at every Tom, Dick,
and Joe Friday

11:25.434 --> 11:26.826
who's willing to look,

11:26.869 --> 11:29.173
I've been doing my job.

11:29.217 --> 11:31.043
What job is that?

11:32.826 --> 11:35.739
Rumor has it you've been given
a new assignment.

11:35.782 --> 11:38.000
Will you be
traveling, too?

11:41.086 --> 11:44.695
Well, I have put in
some time for my vacation.

11:44.739 --> 11:47.217
You never know--
maybe our paths will cross.

11:47.260 --> 11:48.347
Ah!

11:48.391 --> 11:49.739
Where you going?

11:49.782 --> 11:51.826
You know, there's a new app
that tells you

11:51.869 --> 11:54.391
where every Cracker Barrel
in the country is.

11:54.434 --> 11:57.347
I'm going to Central America
to meet an old friend.

11:57.391 --> 11:58.826
Central America.

11:58.869 --> 12:01.347
That's nice-- the land
of tropical martinis

12:01.391 --> 12:03.826
and string bikinis.

12:03.869 --> 12:06.695
Tell me, does CI Ray know
about this "old friend"?

12:06.739 --> 12:08.347
It is a woman, Tony.

12:08.391 --> 12:11.521
She is someone very dear to me
and, uh... I need her advice.

12:11.565 --> 12:14.565
Ray has nothing to worry about.

12:19.913 --> 12:21.913
[clears throat]

12:25.869 --> 12:30.304
I do not know what
you are investigating...

12:30.347 --> 12:32.826
and I do not need to know,

12:32.869 --> 12:36.913
but ever since we lost
Levin and Franks

12:36.956 --> 12:39.869
and EJ left...

12:39.913 --> 12:42.391
NCIS has been through a lot.

12:43.434 --> 12:45.434
Wehave been
through a lot.

12:46.478 --> 12:48.826
We need some time.

12:49.826 --> 12:54.130
We... as in you and me?

12:54.173 --> 12:56.260
That's not what I meant.

12:56.304 --> 13:00.043
Oh... well, what did
you mean then, Ziva?

13:00.086 --> 13:04.086
All I'm saying is...
look out for yourself.

13:06.173 --> 13:08.782
Please?

13:16.869 --> 13:18.043
CRANSTON:
You must have sensed

13:18.086 --> 13:19.869
that they were
concerned about you.

13:19.913 --> 13:21.826
TONY:
I'm sure they were.

13:21.869 --> 13:23.826
Everyone was in the dark,

13:23.869 --> 13:25.173
trying to put
the puzzle together.

13:25.217 --> 13:27.695
Something is gnawing
at me, Jethro,

13:27.739 --> 13:29.826
and as you know,
I am not one to gnaw.

13:29.869 --> 13:31.869
Well, shoot, Duck.
What is it?

13:31.913 --> 13:35.130
Well, you, your agents,
Abby, even Director Vance--

13:35.173 --> 13:38.043
we work together
as a cohesive unit.

13:38.086 --> 13:40.478
We have no secrets
from one another

13:40.521 --> 13:42.217
because there
cannot be any.

13:42.260 --> 13:44.043
That is why we succeed.

13:44.086 --> 13:46.043
Well, yeah, that's
the way it works, Duck.

13:46.086 --> 13:48.043
So?

13:48.086 --> 13:49.913
Well, I noticed something

13:49.956 --> 13:53.043
when I did Agent
Levin's autopsy--

13:53.086 --> 13:55.739
a small postmortem
incision

13:55.782 --> 13:58.521
made with a nonsurgical blade.

14:01.086 --> 14:03.739
You saying that someone else
cut him other than you?

14:03.782 --> 14:05.608
I took the liberty
of downloading

14:05.652 --> 14:07.652
the Autopsy
security images

14:07.695 --> 14:09.782
from the day that
Levin was killed.

14:10.826 --> 14:13.043
Special Agent Barrett

14:13.086 --> 14:15.826
asked for time
alone with the body

14:15.869 --> 14:18.695
so she could say
her good-byes.

14:18.739 --> 14:21.304
That's a hell
of a good-bye, Duck.

14:22.347 --> 14:23.608
She cut him
with her pocketknife.

14:23.652 --> 14:24.826
Yes.

14:24.869 --> 14:28.043
It seems that EJ and
you share an affinity

14:28.086 --> 14:30.043
for retractable weaponry.

14:30.086 --> 14:31.739
She taking something
out of his arm?

14:31.782 --> 14:33.391
Yes.

14:33.434 --> 14:35.217
That's what
astounded me.

14:35.260 --> 14:39.739
Agent Levin had a small
microchip of some sort

14:39.782 --> 14:41.869
embedded in his arm.

14:41.913 --> 14:43.652
Any idea why?Well, that's

14:43.695 --> 14:46.347
where my expertise
ends and yours begins.

14:47.739 --> 14:50.434
Timing of DiNozzo's mission
could explain it.

14:50.478 --> 14:53.304
Well, you said it, not I.

14:58.478 --> 15:00.478
[door opens]

15:00.521 --> 15:02.043
Why do I bother having a door?

15:02.086 --> 15:04.826
When were you going to tell me
about this thing with DiNozzo?

15:04.869 --> 15:08.521
Agent DiNozzo is following
orders given directly to him

15:08.565 --> 15:09.869
by Secretary Jarvis.

15:09.913 --> 15:11.652
He's my responsibility, Leon.

15:11.695 --> 15:14.652
No, he's my responsibility,
and if I'm willing, so are you.

15:17.956 --> 15:19.956
How well do you know Jarvis?

15:22.347 --> 15:25.086
I've known Clayton Jarvis
for almost 20 years.

15:25.130 --> 15:26.695
I've trusted him
with my life.

15:26.739 --> 15:29.000
People change.

15:29.043 --> 15:32.000
I hope you're not questioning
the SECNAV's authority.

15:32.043 --> 15:33.826
Jarvis can do
what he wants.

15:33.869 --> 15:34.956
It's his navy.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.869
It's his navy...

15:36.913 --> 15:38.913
it's my team.

15:42.782 --> 15:47.739
ABBY: Okay... he starts to turn
the picture over... there.

15:47.782 --> 15:48.869
Go two frames back.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.826
See, that looks
like a woman to me.

15:51.869 --> 15:53.521
No, it doesn't.

15:53.565 --> 15:55.043
It looks like a hairy pirate

15:55.086 --> 15:56.826
with a moustache.

15:56.869 --> 15:59.086
You mean, Tony's assignment
is to kill Johnny Depp?

15:59.130 --> 16:01.391
I like Johnny Depp.This isn't working.

16:01.434 --> 16:03.869
ZIVA: Well, it is too grainy,
I cannot see anything.

16:03.913 --> 16:05.826
I don't feel comfortable
doing this.

16:05.869 --> 16:08.260
I know, we're spying
on family.

16:08.304 --> 16:10.913
Well, sometimes
we must cross boundaries

16:10.956 --> 16:11.782
to protect those
we care about.

16:11.826 --> 16:12.782
McGEE:
Well, hypothetically,

16:12.826 --> 16:14.304
what if Ray was Tony's target?

16:14.347 --> 16:15.434
ZIVA:
Okay...

16:15.478 --> 16:17.695
though I am confident
it is not Ray,

16:17.739 --> 16:19.826
we should prepare ourselves
for the unexpected.

16:19.869 --> 16:21.782
I hope it isn't anyone we know.

16:21.826 --> 16:23.913
[sighs]

16:24.869 --> 16:26.260
JARVIS: Mr. Ambassador,
it was a pleasure,

16:26.304 --> 16:27.869
and please give your wife
my regards.

16:27.913 --> 16:28.956
Sir.

16:29.000 --> 16:29.956
I look forward
to seeing you...
Sir.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.478
Not now, Gibbs.

16:31.521 --> 16:33.086
I'm going straight from
here to a charity--
Sir...

16:33.130 --> 16:34.565
you're using
one of my peopleCall my office

16:34.608 --> 16:35.782
without my knowledge.and schedule
an appointment.

16:35.826 --> 16:37.086
They're my people,
too, Gibbs.

16:37.130 --> 16:38.869
Yes, sir, but we function
as a team.

16:38.913 --> 16:41.478
If you remove one,
everything changes.

16:41.521 --> 16:43.173
Director Vance told me
to expect some push-back

16:43.217 --> 16:44.913
from you, but you're being
borderline disrespectful.

16:44.956 --> 16:47.826
That a compliment, sir?

16:47.869 --> 16:49.652
You'll get DiNozzo back
when I'm done with him.

16:49.695 --> 16:51.652
What if he doesn't
make it back?

16:51.695 --> 16:52.869
Sounds like you
know more about

16:52.913 --> 16:54.173
this mission than
you should, Gibbs.

16:54.217 --> 16:57.869
No, sir, I've just been
there many times myself.

16:57.913 --> 16:59.608
MAN:
Stop that car!

16:59.652 --> 17:00.391
Felix!

17:00.434 --> 17:01.956
[gasping]

17:04.652 --> 17:06.347
Call an ambulance.It's okay.

17:06.391 --> 17:09.391
Oh, my God, Felix.

17:09.434 --> 17:10.478
He's a friend.

17:12.782 --> 17:15.565
Well, your friend's dead,
Mr. Secretary.

17:17.652 --> 17:20.739
You think this has anything
to do with it?

17:32.043 --> 17:34.217
Mr. Palmer,

17:34.260 --> 17:37.043
what do you suppose
the SECNAV is saying to them?

17:37.086 --> 17:39.173
JIMMY: Well, if I were him,
I'd be asking how

17:39.217 --> 17:41.608
to get blood
out of a $200 white dress shirt.

17:41.652 --> 17:43.739
See, it's all about
oxygenating the stain.

17:43.782 --> 17:45.347
My mother used
to use club soda,

17:45.391 --> 17:47.652
but my uncle
preferred Perrier

17:47.695 --> 17:48.695
with a dash of...

17:48.739 --> 17:50.739
Um, the incision--

17:50.782 --> 17:52.434
they're probably talking
about the incision.

17:52.478 --> 17:54.695
DUCKY: Well, it's in exactly
the same location

17:54.739 --> 17:57.304
as Agent Levin's.

17:57.347 --> 17:58.739
Captain Wright was
a highly decorated naval officer

17:58.782 --> 18:00.739
and a valued member
of the DOD.

18:00.782 --> 18:02.782
Make this investigation
a priority.

18:02.826 --> 18:04.521
You could start with the
incision in his arm.

18:04.565 --> 18:06.260
NCIS Special
Agent Levin

18:06.304 --> 18:08.478
had one, too.

18:11.130 --> 18:14.478
There will be no discussion
of Captain Wright's death

18:14.521 --> 18:16.130
with anybody outside
this core group.

18:16.173 --> 18:17.608
Do I need to repeat myself?

18:17.652 --> 18:19.652
No, sir.

18:26.347 --> 18:28.304
[engine starts]

18:28.347 --> 18:31.000
[car doors close]

18:31.043 --> 18:32.565
Your timing is impeccable.

18:32.608 --> 18:36.043
I got the answer
I was looking for.

18:36.086 --> 18:37.434
On the DL,

18:37.478 --> 18:39.391
ask Agents McGee and David

18:39.434 --> 18:41.782
to find the thread
that links Wright to Levin.

18:41.826 --> 18:44.260
And the microchip?

18:44.304 --> 18:45.304
I wish I knew.

18:53.521 --> 18:56.608
Did Gibbs notice you weren't
at the hotel?

18:56.652 --> 19:00.739
Well, missing a crime scene
never goes over well,

19:00.782 --> 19:03.826
but I was already
on the mission.

19:03.869 --> 19:06.043
What did you say to him?

19:06.086 --> 19:07.434
I didn't.

19:07.478 --> 19:10.391
He knew I wasn't there.

19:10.434 --> 19:13.391
Gibbs sees everything, you know.

19:13.434 --> 19:17.608
And where were you in
your assignment at this point?

19:17.652 --> 19:19.739
I don't know.

19:22.130 --> 19:25.217
You know, when my mom died,
we were in a room like this.

19:25.260 --> 19:29.608
I remember 'cause there
was a movie playing--

19:29.652 --> 19:33.130
Angels with Dirty Faces.

19:33.173 --> 19:35.173
Michael Curtiz.

19:37.695 --> 19:39.652
These two kids
growing up together.

19:40.913 --> 19:42.913
Bogie's priest.

19:46.695 --> 19:49.043
Cagney...

19:49.086 --> 19:52.826
the mobster searching
for answers.

19:54.826 --> 19:57.086
Life's crossroads.

20:00.652 --> 20:02.608
We all make decisions,

20:02.652 --> 20:06.000
some smarter
than others.

20:07.347 --> 20:09.782
Pieces weren't fitting together.

20:11.434 --> 20:13.391
I had to talk to Agent Barrett.

20:13.434 --> 20:15.434
Why?

20:16.478 --> 20:18.739
She the one
in the photograph?

20:18.782 --> 20:22.000
The thing about chasing
a federal agent--

20:22.043 --> 20:24.652
they know how to disappear.

20:24.695 --> 20:28.608
She was careful about
not leaving a paper trail.

20:28.652 --> 20:30.608
Not careful enough.

20:30.652 --> 20:32.608
Kiawah Island, huh?

20:32.652 --> 20:34.782
Nice. Beachy.

20:34.826 --> 20:37.521
Hello, Tony, how are you?

20:37.565 --> 20:38.521
Working.

20:38.565 --> 20:39.608
Looks like you are, too.

20:40.956 --> 20:43.652
There's someone I need
to see-- friend of a friend.

20:43.695 --> 20:46.608
Is it about the microchip
you took out of Levin's arm?

20:47.869 --> 20:49.739
We need to talk.

20:49.782 --> 20:52.217
I can't,
not till I get back.

20:52.260 --> 20:53.695
I don't know what
you're mixed up in,

20:53.739 --> 20:55.913
but people are
looking for you, okay?

20:55.956 --> 20:58.173
People who don't have
the same personal investment

20:58.217 --> 20:59.260
as yours truly.

20:59.304 --> 21:00.739
I made a promise
to someone, Tony,

21:00.782 --> 21:01.913
and now I need
to fulfill it.

21:01.956 --> 21:03.913
I made a promise
to someone, too--

21:03.956 --> 21:06.391
a promise I fully
intend to keep.

21:06.434 --> 21:09.043
You took something, EJ,

21:09.086 --> 21:11.391
something that's causing
people a lot of concern.

21:11.434 --> 21:12.869
Is that why you're here?

21:12.913 --> 21:14.086
And they want it back.

21:14.130 --> 21:15.478
It's not mine to give.

21:15.521 --> 21:20.391
You have an option here,
but you have to trust me.

21:21.434 --> 21:24.260
And what if I can't?

21:24.304 --> 21:26.695
Then I can't help you.

21:34.826 --> 21:37.391
While I was getting deeper
into my assignment, I knew

21:37.434 --> 21:39.000
Gibbs wouldn't be letting up,

21:39.043 --> 21:41.652
trying to figure out what Wright and Levin had in common.

21:41.695 --> 21:43.347
Anything, McGee?

21:43.391 --> 21:44.391
Uh, plenty.

21:44.434 --> 21:46.782
After weeks
of navigating red tape,

21:46.826 --> 21:48.565
I think I finally got
through the government firewall

21:48.608 --> 21:50.521
connecting Levin to Wright.

21:50.565 --> 21:52.000
Yeah. And...?

21:52.043 --> 21:54.695
Both men used to be
Office of Naval Intel.

21:54.739 --> 21:57.130
ONI isn't in Levin's file.

21:57.173 --> 21:59.739
All the details
were redacted.

21:59.782 --> 22:01.565
Both apparently worked for the
Director of Special Operations,

22:01.608 --> 22:03.565
a civilian named
Sean Latham.

22:03.608 --> 22:05.000
Latham leads a
secret armada

22:05.043 --> 22:07.130
of spy vessels called
the Watcher Fleet.

22:07.173 --> 22:09.608
Watchers are loaded
with billions in surveillance.

22:09.652 --> 22:11.565
They constantly
are monitoring terrorist

22:11.608 --> 22:13.217
and anti-military activity.

22:13.260 --> 22:14.739
Spying on the spies.

22:14.782 --> 22:16.434
After their time at ONI,

22:16.478 --> 22:18.391
Agent Levin was
transferred here,

22:18.434 --> 22:20.478
and Captain Wright went
to the Pentagon.

22:20.521 --> 22:22.652
Gotta wonder what's
on those microchips.

22:22.695 --> 22:23.956
Yeah.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.652
And who'd kill for 'em.

22:25.695 --> 22:28.521
Is this what Tony's
wrapped up in?

22:33.521 --> 22:35.608
Special Agent Gibbs?

22:36.869 --> 22:39.086
Yeah. What can I do for you?

22:39.130 --> 22:41.173
[clears his throat]

22:41.217 --> 22:43.434
Agent Stratton, FBI.

22:45.391 --> 22:46.652
Busy night, huh?

22:46.695 --> 22:48.347
Burning the wick
at both ends.

22:48.391 --> 22:50.173
Yeah, that's what coffee's for.

22:52.826 --> 22:55.043
Can I help you
with something, Stratton?

22:55.086 --> 22:59.173
Yeah. Uh, Special
Agent Anthony DiNozzo.

22:59.217 --> 23:01.043
We got wind he
may have been

23:01.086 --> 23:03.347
involved in an altercation
with another federal agent.

23:03.391 --> 23:05.043
Can you verify that?

23:05.086 --> 23:07.043
No.

23:07.086 --> 23:10.826
Well, is Agent DiNozzo a
patient in this hospital or not?

23:10.869 --> 23:13.608
Well, being a patient doesn't
mean he did anything wrong.

23:14.260 --> 23:15.695
Well...

23:15.739 --> 23:17.608
we'll be the judge
of that.
No, you won't.

23:17.652 --> 23:19.782
Anything happened, this case
would have been handed over

23:19.826 --> 23:21.695
to my IG for a
2B investigation.

23:21.739 --> 23:23.478
I want to talk to him.

23:24.521 --> 23:25.739
There was an accident.

23:25.782 --> 23:27.782
He had a head injury.

23:29.086 --> 23:30.652
I heard he was shot.

23:30.695 --> 23:33.782
Man, I tell you, you're just
chock full of all kinds of

23:33.826 --> 23:36.217
bad information, Stratton.

23:36.260 --> 23:38.565
Go home.
Sorry you got out of bed.

23:38.608 --> 23:39.739
CRANSTON:
So, what happened

23:39.782 --> 23:41.826
after she decided
to leave with you?

23:41.869 --> 23:44.130
She was being evasive,

23:44.173 --> 23:46.260
and I needed answers.

23:46.304 --> 23:48.043
People know you took
the microchip. Why?

23:48.086 --> 23:49.565
Because Levin
told me to.

23:49.608 --> 23:51.217
Because if anything
happened to him,

23:51.260 --> 23:53.565
I swore I'd get it
to the right person

23:53.608 --> 23:55.217
before it fell into
the wrong hands.

23:55.260 --> 23:57.086
What's on it?

23:57.130 --> 23:59.347
I honestly have no idea.

23:59.391 --> 24:00.695
You're lying.

24:00.739 --> 24:02.739
All I did was
make a promise.

24:02.782 --> 24:03.913
To who? The highest bidder?

24:03.956 --> 24:05.478
Is that what this is about?

24:05.521 --> 24:06.608
You're selling information?

24:06.652 --> 24:08.217
Who were you going to see?

24:08.260 --> 24:09.739
No one.

24:09.782 --> 24:12.000
I need to know the truth, EJ.

24:15.347 --> 24:17.782
Navy Captain Felix Wright.

24:17.826 --> 24:19.608
He's been out
of the country.

24:20.608 --> 24:23.304
No. He's dead.

24:24.130 --> 24:26.347
[gunfire]

24:26.391 --> 24:28.652
Go! Get in the
car, EJ! Go!

24:31.565 --> 24:33.521
Stay down!

24:33.565 --> 24:34.478
Did you see 'em?

24:34.521 --> 24:35.434
How many?

24:35.478 --> 24:36.782
Hold on.

24:36.826 --> 24:38.434
[engine revving]

24:46.043 --> 24:49.695
CRANSTON: So Barrett was
the one in the photo.

24:49.739 --> 24:51.739
The traitor.

24:51.782 --> 24:53.739
I didn't say that.

24:53.782 --> 24:55.260
They wanted
their chip back.

24:55.304 --> 24:58.260
Barrett took it.
They tried to kill her.

24:59.304 --> 25:01.652
They were shooting
at both of us.

25:01.695 --> 25:03.695
You're defending her.

25:04.913 --> 25:07.217
EJ...

25:07.260 --> 25:09.434
needed my help.

25:09.478 --> 25:11.434
Why do you think
you keep getting involved

25:11.478 --> 25:13.000
with dysfunctional women?

25:15.652 --> 25:17.608
What?!

25:17.652 --> 25:19.608
Well, the women you date

25:19.652 --> 25:22.695
are, well... messed up.

25:22.739 --> 25:23.869
I date all kinds of women.

25:23.913 --> 25:26.043
You know, I think
you're drawn to them

25:26.086 --> 25:27.652
because you want to help them.

25:27.695 --> 25:29.826
I am drawn to them because,
usually, they're pretty hot.

25:29.869 --> 25:31.826
Tony, admit it.

25:31.869 --> 25:34.086
You like hot girls
who carry guns.

25:34.130 --> 25:36.521
Who doesn't like hot girls
who carry guns?

25:36.565 --> 25:40.086
Which brings us back
to Agent Barrett.

25:40.130 --> 25:41.956
Of course it does.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.826
Oh, I see what
you did there.

25:43.869 --> 25:45.347
[laughs]

25:45.391 --> 25:47.782
That was tricky.

25:47.826 --> 25:50.000
You really like
these head games, don't you?

25:50.043 --> 25:51.913
You did that on purpose.

25:51.956 --> 25:53.652
Anger releases endorphins,

25:53.695 --> 25:56.478
and endorphins can jog
all sorts of memories.

25:59.913 --> 26:03.000
In the case file, Jarvis gave me
some information about...

26:04.826 --> 26:07.521
...microchips.

26:07.565 --> 26:09.782
Now that we know about
Wright and Levin's

26:09.826 --> 26:11.043
Naval Intel connection,

26:11.086 --> 26:13.260
I did a little digging
of my own.

26:13.304 --> 26:15.304
When implanted
under the flesh,

26:15.347 --> 26:18.347
microchips can leave behind
metal hydride corrosion.

26:18.391 --> 26:20.347
High-tech rust.
Look what I figured out.

26:20.391 --> 26:21.739
That it hurt.

26:21.782 --> 26:24.043
Well, yeah,
but based on the level

26:24.086 --> 26:27.739
of metallic decomp Ducky found,
I was able to determine

26:27.782 --> 26:29.826
that the chips
were implanted

26:29.869 --> 26:31.739
at approximately
the same time.

26:31.782 --> 26:34.826
Both in the left arm, both
in the same position, and both

26:34.869 --> 26:38.826
functioning as low-emitting
radiofrequency I.D. tags.

26:38.869 --> 26:40.826
They were access chips.

26:40.869 --> 26:42.913
Electronic door-openers.

26:48.434 --> 26:51.347
Gibbs, this is
Sean Latham,

26:51.391 --> 26:53.782
ONI's Director
of the Watcher Fleet.

26:53.826 --> 26:56.826
I didn't know
if you guys really existed.

26:56.869 --> 26:58.391
Flesh and blood.

26:58.434 --> 27:01.043
JARVIS: Normally, we wouldn't
be discussing an ONI program,

27:01.086 --> 27:02.869
but we have a situation.

27:02.913 --> 27:05.304
And I just lost a
dear friend. Sean?

27:05.347 --> 27:07.434
Gayne Levin and Felix Wright
worked for me

27:07.478 --> 27:09.826
as a part of a program
called Phantom Eight--

27:09.869 --> 27:12.869
an eight-man squad that tried
to preemptively influence

27:12.913 --> 27:14.652
international acts of terrorism.

27:14.695 --> 27:15.869
Stop 'em before they happen.

27:15.913 --> 27:18.565
Each operative was tagged
with a microchip,

27:18.608 --> 27:20.826
a pass key, giving them access,

27:20.869 --> 27:22.739
worldwide,
to the Watcher database.

27:22.782 --> 27:25.043
JARVIS: Wave your arm over
a secure laptop, download

27:25.086 --> 27:26.304
classified information

27:26.347 --> 27:28.173
our enemies would
pay top dollar for.

27:28.217 --> 27:29.695
When Levin was killed,

27:29.739 --> 27:31.608
ONI's intention was
to remove his chip immediately.

27:31.652 --> 27:34.826
Unfortunately, one of your
agents got to him first.

27:34.869 --> 27:38.478
And you think Agent Barrett
is in it to make a profit?

27:38.521 --> 27:41.826
We don't want
to risk finding out.

27:41.869 --> 27:43.130
Why are you
sharing this with me?

27:43.173 --> 27:44.521
JARVIS:
We now believe

27:44.565 --> 27:46.913
she's working internally...
with someone else.

27:46.956 --> 27:48.739
You want to know who.

27:48.782 --> 27:50.826
We're already looking, Gibbs.

27:50.869 --> 27:52.869
Find her,

27:52.913 --> 27:54.695
find the stolen microchips.

27:54.739 --> 27:57.000
It's a matter
of national security.

28:10.043 --> 28:12.043
Hi, Gibbs.

28:14.086 --> 28:15.521
Boss, we need
your help.

28:16.565 --> 28:18.565
Mm-hmm.

28:18.608 --> 28:20.391
After you cook dinner.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
TONY:
So, I'm sitting there,

28:24.043 --> 28:26.391
and I'm... you know,
I'm on my third tequila.

28:26.434 --> 28:28.869
I'm not in good shape,
and Franks is, like,

28:28.913 --> 28:30.173
12 sheets to the wind,

28:30.217 --> 28:32.434
when all of a sudden,
the door swings open,

28:32.478 --> 28:34.565
and standing there are
the three deadliest drug dealers

28:34.608 --> 28:36.869
in all of Mexico,
and you know what Franks does?

28:36.913 --> 28:38.521
He turns to the bartender,
and he says...

28:38.565 --> 28:40.782
[imitates Franks' raspy voice]:
"Cervezas for my amigos.

28:40.826 --> 28:42.000
"If I'm dead,

28:42.043 --> 28:44.391
put it on my tab, probie."

28:44.434 --> 28:46.521
[laughs]

28:48.347 --> 28:50.608
His family's here now.

28:50.652 --> 28:52.652
It's good to
have 'em close.

29:01.565 --> 29:04.173
You know
what you got there, Barrett?

29:04.217 --> 29:06.217
Nope.

29:06.260 --> 29:07.913
I don't want to, either.

29:07.956 --> 29:10.086
You were supposed
to give it to Wright.

29:10.130 --> 29:12.000
Now what do we do?

29:12.043 --> 29:13.739
Figure out who it belongs to?

29:13.782 --> 29:15.086
Jarvis?

29:15.130 --> 29:16.913
You think?

29:16.956 --> 29:18.826
You don't trust anyone,

29:18.869 --> 29:20.565
do you, Gibbs?
Yeah, I do.

29:22.086 --> 29:24.000
I just make 'em earn it.

29:24.043 --> 29:26.739
The only people I trusted
were the men on my team.

29:28.086 --> 29:30.391
Well...

29:30.434 --> 29:33.347
I'm starting to worry about
the big guy in all of this.

29:33.391 --> 29:34.869
Cade?

29:34.913 --> 29:36.521
Yeah.
Why?

29:36.565 --> 29:39.391
Cade and Levin were tight.

29:39.434 --> 29:41.434
Maybe he knew too much.

29:43.217 --> 29:45.869
Get him back here.

29:45.913 --> 29:47.000
You in contact?

29:47.043 --> 29:48.391
Not since we left.

29:48.434 --> 29:50.217
Try.

29:55.043 --> 29:56.695
CRANSTON:
So that's when you realized

29:56.739 --> 29:58.739
you couldn't do this alone?

29:58.782 --> 30:00.913
I trust these
people with my life.

30:00.956 --> 30:03.000
Like family.

30:03.043 --> 30:05.000
[laughs]
No.

30:05.043 --> 30:06.565
Not my family.

30:06.608 --> 30:10.608
My family is... way
less dependable.

30:10.652 --> 30:13.043
You should meet my
father sometime.

30:13.086 --> 30:14.434
It would explain a lot.

30:14.478 --> 30:15.913
I'd like that.

30:15.956 --> 30:17.782
He'd like that,
too, I think.

30:20.608 --> 30:22.608
NCIS is...

30:22.652 --> 30:25.304
part of who I am.

30:25.347 --> 30:27.347
And yet you took an assignment

30:27.391 --> 30:29.695
that resulted
in the death of another agent...

30:29.739 --> 30:33.956
the very people you say
you trust with your life?

30:34.000 --> 30:36.695
You're contradicting yourself.

30:36.739 --> 30:38.739
Wouldn't be
the first time.

30:42.391 --> 30:44.043
STRATTON:
I'm sorry.

30:44.086 --> 30:45.434
[laughing]:
Am I interrupting?

30:45.478 --> 30:47.000
Who are you?

30:47.043 --> 30:48.956
[sighs] Didn't Gibbs
tell you I was here?

30:49.000 --> 30:50.608
I'm Agent Stratton,

30:50.652 --> 30:52.217
FBI.

30:53.608 --> 30:55.608
I apologize.
I-I didn't realize

30:55.652 --> 30:57.217
Agent DiNozzo
was with anyone.

30:57.260 --> 30:58.782
And you are...?

30:58.826 --> 31:00.521
His doctor.

31:00.565 --> 31:02.000
Whoa. [laughs]

31:02.043 --> 31:05.000
Look at me, interrupting
with a doctor's work.

31:05.043 --> 31:09.043
I'm just so glad to see
you're alive, Agent DiNozzo.

31:09.086 --> 31:10.565
Thanks.

31:10.608 --> 31:12.565
It's a miracle, really,
and thank heaven.

31:12.608 --> 31:15.086
Well, you and I can talk later,
if that's all right

31:15.130 --> 31:16.173
with you, Doc.

31:16.217 --> 31:18.086
[quietly]:
I'm calling Agent Gibbs.

31:18.130 --> 31:20.130
Now is clearly the wrong time.

31:20.173 --> 31:22.304
The doctor is in, so I'm out.

31:22.347 --> 31:24.782
Take care of
yourself, pal.

31:24.826 --> 31:26.826
Okay?

31:31.000 --> 31:34.043
So, Tony...
what happened next?

31:34.086 --> 31:36.217
TONY: Well, I knew it was time
to resurface,

31:36.260 --> 31:39.913
time to come in and see
what surfaced with me.

31:39.956 --> 31:42.000
Here you go.

31:43.434 --> 31:44.826
Tony, you've been
off the grid for weeks.

31:44.869 --> 31:46.521
You miss me,
McWorry-wart?

31:46.565 --> 31:48.521
I was busy doing my job.

31:48.565 --> 31:49.869
Well, we were concerned.

31:49.913 --> 31:52.521
We?I see.

31:52.565 --> 31:55.608
Yes, Tony, I
expressed curiosity.

31:55.652 --> 31:57.521
Even though you're
more than capable

31:57.565 --> 31:59.260
of taking care of yourself.

31:59.304 --> 32:01.434
You and Ray are cut
from the same quilt.

32:01.478 --> 32:04.304
Cloth.Oh, don't interrupt her,
boss-- she's on a roll.

32:04.347 --> 32:07.043
Of course.

32:07.086 --> 32:10.000
Makes total sense...

32:12.478 --> 32:14.130
...since EJ's the
one you are after.

32:14.173 --> 32:16.652
She's the one in the
photograph, is she not?

32:19.521 --> 32:21.608
You know I can't answer that.

32:21.652 --> 32:23.000
ABBY:
Gibbs.

32:23.043 --> 32:24.608
McGee. Somebody help.

32:24.652 --> 32:27.043
Abbs.
Route my cell phone
to the plasma.

32:27.086 --> 32:28.173
Tapping into the WiFi now.

32:28.217 --> 32:29.869
It's Cade. He just
sent me this message.

32:29.913 --> 32:31.869
Something's happened.
He is in trouble.

32:33.260 --> 32:36.652
You gotta help me, Abb.

32:36.695 --> 32:37.956
I don't know what to do here.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.695
Someone's after me.

32:39.739 --> 32:41.652
[grunts]

32:57.869 --> 33:00.869
I just spoke to Fornell
about Agent Stratton.

33:00.913 --> 33:03.086
Know him?

33:04.565 --> 33:07.304
Doc, can you give us a minute?

33:07.347 --> 33:08.739
All right.

33:08.782 --> 33:10.913
I'll go get my sixth cup of
coffee for the evening.

33:10.956 --> 33:13.434
Lightweight.

33:13.478 --> 33:16.173
[quietly]: Ruin all my hard work
and I'll kill you.

33:16.217 --> 33:18.652
Copy that.

33:28.652 --> 33:29.869
Brass from your weapon.

33:29.913 --> 33:31.434
We found it in the alley.

33:32.652 --> 33:34.608
I told you, boss, I...

33:34.652 --> 33:36.956
Just shut up and listen,
DiNozzo.

33:39.043 --> 33:43.173
Abby's running DNA from
spatter found at the scene.

33:43.217 --> 33:44.347
In addition
to your blood,

33:44.391 --> 33:45.608
there were two
other types found.

33:45.652 --> 33:47.565
Two?

33:47.608 --> 33:52.086
Three people
altogether, DiNozzo.

33:52.130 --> 33:55.782
I know this is hard,
but I need to know

33:55.826 --> 33:58.000
who you were handling.

34:03.086 --> 34:05.043
Great playing with you, Brian.

34:05.086 --> 34:07.173
All right.I'll see you again.

34:07.217 --> 34:10.043
Been waiting long,
DiNozzo?

34:10.086 --> 34:13.043
Permission to speak
candidly, Mr. Secretary?

34:13.086 --> 34:15.739
Go for it.

34:15.782 --> 34:18.043
This mission blows.

34:18.086 --> 34:20.173
Oh, I'm sorry
you're disappointed.

34:20.217 --> 34:22.565
Rule number one
in Washington politics--

34:22.608 --> 34:23.913
don't take work
personally.

34:25.043 --> 34:28.434
I know a few rules,
too, sir.

34:28.478 --> 34:30.434
Such as?

34:30.478 --> 34:32.913
Rule number three: Never
believe what you're told.

34:33.956 --> 34:36.000
What are you insinuating?

34:36.043 --> 34:38.260
Rule number five:
Don't waste good.

34:38.304 --> 34:41.043
In other words, I'm wasting
your precious time?

34:41.086 --> 34:43.695
And then, of course, there's
my favorite-- rule number 36:

34:43.739 --> 34:47.956
If you feel like you're being
played, you probably are.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.565
What do you want?

34:50.608 --> 34:52.478
I want you to take me
off this assignment.

34:52.521 --> 34:55.043
I can't do that.

34:55.086 --> 34:56.478
I feel like I'm too close.

34:56.521 --> 34:59.217
That's the sacrifice.

34:59.260 --> 35:00.521
Nature of the beast.

35:00.565 --> 35:02.521
People are getting hurt--
people I care about--

35:02.565 --> 35:04.652
and I'm not asking you,
sir, I'm telling you.

35:04.695 --> 35:05.782
You take me
off this assignment

35:05.826 --> 35:08.086
or I resign from NCIS.

35:09.130 --> 35:12.043
That felt like a threat.

35:12.086 --> 35:13.608
You want to hear
my second rule?

35:13.652 --> 35:14.956
Sure.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.217
Don't screw with me.

35:17.260 --> 35:18.521
I own you.

35:18.565 --> 35:20.956
Know it, accept it.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.086
It comes with the detail.

35:23.130 --> 35:26.000
You gonna give me another
speech about patience,

35:26.043 --> 35:27.608
maybe throw in
a golf metaphor?

35:27.652 --> 35:29.217
Sure.

35:29.260 --> 35:31.652
You're OB, Agent DiNozzo.

35:31.695 --> 35:32.956
Now, get lost before
you say something

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
you can't back out of.

35:54.217 --> 35:57.304
I hope you play better
than you negotiate.

35:57.347 --> 35:59.347
Spare me the criticism.

36:00.826 --> 36:03.782
He seems to be handling things
worse than you predicted.

36:04.826 --> 36:07.043
He'll come around.

36:07.086 --> 36:09.565
Maybe.

36:09.608 --> 36:11.608
Maybe not.

36:19.695 --> 36:21.782
They never saw it coming.

36:21.826 --> 36:23.260
She was blindsided.

36:23.304 --> 36:25.869
She?

36:31.608 --> 36:33.782
[distant siren wailing,
dog barking]

36:37.608 --> 36:38.608
[clattering]

36:41.739 --> 36:43.478
Cade?

36:46.695 --> 36:48.391
Hey, Eej.

36:48.434 --> 36:52.782
Oh, God, I thought for
sure you were dead.

36:52.826 --> 36:55.521
Oh, your hands
are freezing.

36:55.565 --> 36:56.695
Let's go.
There's a diner down the street.

36:56.739 --> 36:58.695
We can...
Wait.

36:58.739 --> 37:01.304
Are you all right?

37:01.347 --> 37:05.695
Since I got shot,
life has been different.

37:05.739 --> 37:07.043
I can't work,

37:07.086 --> 37:09.130
and now I'm being chased
and I have no idea why.

37:09.173 --> 37:11.391
TONY:
You sold out, Cade.

37:12.739 --> 37:15.652
Step away from him, EJ.

37:15.695 --> 37:17.608
Tony...

37:17.652 --> 37:19.260
TONY:
Watch the hands.

37:20.782 --> 37:22.739
Well, tell her,
big guy, go ahead.

37:22.782 --> 37:25.608
Tell her.

37:25.652 --> 37:28.173
You know
all about the microchip.

37:28.217 --> 37:30.217
You already killed
Captain Wright.

37:31.869 --> 37:33.173
So, what,

37:33.217 --> 37:35.217
now you want to get your hands
on Levin's, too?

37:35.260 --> 37:37.173
What are you saying,
DiNozzo?

37:37.217 --> 37:38.260
Hey!

37:38.304 --> 37:41.217
I got a message from EJ
to come to DC.

37:41.260 --> 37:44.043
Next thing I know,
I'm being hunted,

37:44.086 --> 37:47.173
and then she sends me
a text to, to meet her here.

37:47.217 --> 37:49.739
I never texted you.

37:52.782 --> 37:54.739
EJ, who told you
to come here tonight?

37:54.782 --> 37:55.869
I thought you did.

37:55.913 --> 37:58.043
The text said
we should all meet here.

37:58.086 --> 38:01.652
I got the same message.

38:20.086 --> 38:22.043
You said I fired my gun.

38:23.304 --> 38:24.782
What about the badge
in my pocket?

38:24.826 --> 38:28.260
Metro found Cade's body
along the Potomac.

38:28.304 --> 38:29.652
The badge was his.

38:29.695 --> 38:32.826
Cade.

38:34.652 --> 38:36.391
What about
the gunshot wounds?

38:36.434 --> 38:40.565
Duck said the fatal shot
was from another weapon.

38:40.608 --> 38:42.652
Shots from your gun
were all postmortem.

38:42.695 --> 38:45.782
So, what, they...

38:45.826 --> 38:49.652
they planted the badge...

38:49.695 --> 38:52.217
to make it look
like I killed him?

38:52.260 --> 38:54.217
EJ.

38:54.260 --> 38:55.695
Still looking.

38:57.782 --> 38:59.739
Tony, you never fired.

39:02.434 --> 39:04.217
You didn't kill them.

39:07.869 --> 39:10.782
DiNozzo, the photo
was always Cade.

39:10.826 --> 39:12.304
JARVIS:
You saw the photo.

39:12.347 --> 39:14.086
You know who the problem is.

39:15.913 --> 39:17.826
Make it happen.

39:21.652 --> 39:25.652
Yeah, I knew
EJ didn't do it,

39:25.695 --> 39:29.217
but I needed her help
to bring Cade in.

39:29.260 --> 39:31.260
SECNAV was positive
it was him.

39:32.608 --> 39:37.043
I had to convince her to reach
out and draw him back to DC.

39:37.086 --> 39:39.043
Well, it worked.

39:39.086 --> 39:41.565
When EJ took
the microchip...

39:43.391 --> 39:46.478
...the doors opened.

39:46.521 --> 39:48.478
We were all used.

39:48.521 --> 39:51.478
Someone wanted those chips.

39:51.521 --> 39:55.739
You saw the shooter,
Tony, in that alley.

39:57.695 --> 40:00.304
Who was it?

40:19.652 --> 40:21.652
Stratton.

40:23.608 --> 40:25.695
He killed them.

40:34.826 --> 40:37.043
Lot of blood was shed.

40:40.652 --> 40:42.000
Gentlemen, I intend

40:42.043 --> 40:44.000
to find out
who Casey Stratton really is.

40:44.043 --> 40:46.304
Bureau doesn't know him.

40:46.347 --> 40:47.608
They tried to kill
DiNozzo once.

40:47.652 --> 40:49.695
They went to the hospital
to finish the job.

40:49.739 --> 40:50.695
We got stills

40:50.739 --> 40:51.826
from hospital security,

40:51.869 --> 40:53.652
but he hasn't turned up
on any database.

40:53.695 --> 40:55.782
I want to know how
this son of a bitch knew

40:55.826 --> 40:56.739
about the microchips.

40:57.782 --> 41:00.391
The mission was always Cade.

41:00.434 --> 41:02.782
This was not
supposed to happen.

41:02.826 --> 41:05.260
Agent DiNozzo is alive,
Mr. Secretary.

41:05.304 --> 41:07.826
