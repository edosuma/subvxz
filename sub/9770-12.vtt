<i>Hope so.</i>

01:53.613 --> 01:54.113
<i>Love, Zoey.</i>

02:10.255 --> 02:12.215
- Man, I am so psyched
for spring break.

02:12.298 --> 02:15.385
- You and me both.
I need to de-stress.

02:15.468 --> 02:18.221
Hey, how many pairs of underwear
you think I should pack?

02:18.304 --> 02:19.973
- Uh, I don't really feel
qualified

02:20.056 --> 02:22.475
to help you with
your underwear math.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.352
- [sighs]
Let's see.

02:24.435 --> 02:27.939
I'll be at Logan's house
for six days.

02:28.022 --> 02:30.108
I like to change at least
once every--

02:30.191 --> 02:32.068
what did you just pack
in your suitcase?

02:32.151 --> 02:33.903
- Nothin'.
[chuckles]

02:33.987 --> 02:35.405
- Yeah, you did.
What was it?

02:41.327 --> 02:43.955
Fine.
Don't let me see.

02:45.665 --> 02:48.251
Ha. Ha ha.

02:48.334 --> 02:49.878
- Ok, gimme that.

02:49.961 --> 02:51.629
- Oh, cologne.

02:51.713 --> 02:52.964
- No.
[chuckles]

02:53.047 --> 02:54.507
It's medicine.
For pimples.

02:54.591 --> 02:57.218
- Well, you must have some
pretty sweet-smellin' pimples.

02:58.428 --> 03:00.138
- What, a pimple
can't smell nice?

03:01.180 --> 03:03.057
- Well, I think you want
to smell nice

03:03.141 --> 03:05.935
for a certain young lady
who goes by the name of Zoey.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.270
- Maybe I want to smell nice
for you.

03:07.353 --> 03:08.104
Ever think of that?

03:08.187 --> 03:09.898
- Hey, you know what you ought

03:09.981 --> 03:11.649
to do on the spring break trip?

03:11.733 --> 03:12.442
- What should I do?

03:12.525 --> 03:14.193
- Tell Zoey you love her.

03:14.277 --> 03:14.944
- Man, go do your underwear
math.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.446
- It's the perfect time.

03:16.529 --> 03:20.241
Spring break, Santa Barbara
right by the beach.

03:20.325 --> 03:22.785
It's very romantic.
- So?

03:22.869 --> 03:25.288
- So it's the perfect time for
you to tell Zoey you love her.

03:25.371 --> 03:28.291
- Would you stop sayin' that
so loud?

03:28.374 --> 03:29.459
- Why?

03:29.542 --> 03:31.085
- I don't want people
to know, okay?

03:31.169 --> 03:34.130
- Dude, everyone on planet earth
knows you love Zoey.

03:34.213 --> 03:36.090
The people on Neptune know it.
Yeah.

03:36.174 --> 03:38.801
They're up there right now
on Neptune sayin',

03:38.885 --> 03:40.970
"Hey, do you know that
Chase loves Zoey?"

03:41.054 --> 03:44.641
"Why, yes, I do.
The whole galaxy knows. Nah."

03:44.724 --> 03:45.975
- You talk so much.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.518
- Look, the only person who
doesn't know

03:47.602 --> 03:48.895
you love Zoey is Zoey.

03:48.978 --> 03:50.521
So why don't you just tell
her already?

03:50.605 --> 03:53.858
- Because I don't want Zoey
to know I love...

03:53.942 --> 03:55.276
Brussels sprouts.

03:55.360 --> 03:58.488
- [chuckles]
- You love Brussels sprouts?

03:58.571 --> 04:01.866
- Yeah. They're, like,
my favorite vegetable.

04:02.909 --> 04:05.328
Is that a problem?
- No.

04:05.411 --> 04:07.163
- Hey, Reese, you left
your shampoo in the shower.

04:08.247 --> 04:09.499
- And you couldn't bring it
to me?

04:09.582 --> 04:11.542
- Nope.

04:11.626 --> 04:13.294
- [sighs]
Back in a sec.

04:16.714 --> 04:18.882
- Would you quit talking about
me and Zoey in front of Logan?

04:18.966 --> 04:20.009
- If you tell her you love her.
- No.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.678
- Give me one good reason.

04:21.761 --> 04:24.889
- All right, you want a reason?
I'll give you a reason.

04:24.973 --> 04:27.517
What if I tell Zoey I love her
and she doesn't love me back?

04:27.600 --> 04:31.020
I mean, that'll make things
so awkward between us.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.814
It could wreck
our friendship forever.

04:32.897 --> 04:34.232
- But if she does love you back,

04:34.315 --> 04:35.858
then she'll become
your girlfriend,

04:35.942 --> 04:37.110
and you'll be
"happy Chase" forever.

04:37.193 --> 04:39.195
- It's not worth the risk.

04:39.278 --> 04:41.990
- Life is about taking risks.

04:42.073 --> 04:43.116
Remember that saying
we learned in Latin?

04:43.199 --> 04:46.202
Carpe doom?
"Seize the day"?

04:46.286 --> 04:48.663
- Um, it's "carpe diem."

04:48.746 --> 04:50.665
- Then what's "carpe doom"?

04:50.748 --> 04:51.874
- Stupid.

04:51.958 --> 04:52.375
- Oh, yeah.

05:04.262 --> 05:06.055
- How we all gonna fit
in one car?

05:06.139 --> 05:07.890
- Don't worry about it.

05:07.974 --> 05:08.891
Hey, where's Nicole?

05:08.975 --> 05:11.561
I told everyone
to be here on time.

05:11.644 --> 05:13.438
- Relax.
Here she comes.

05:13.521 --> 05:14.272
- Come on.
A little bit further.

05:14.355 --> 05:18.276
No pain, no gai--
careful.

05:21.487 --> 05:22.322
[both groaning]

05:22.405 --> 05:26.075
Thanks, guys.
You can go now.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.619
- Hey. You said you'd give each
of us 10 bucks.

05:28.703 --> 05:31.080
- I was kidding.
Run along.

05:34.542 --> 05:35.918
- So, guys,
I forgot to tell you.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.336
When we get to my house,

05:37.420 --> 05:38.921
there's gonna be
a little surprise.

05:39.005 --> 05:41.549
- What kind of surprise?

05:41.632 --> 05:43.051
- I do not like surprises.

05:43.134 --> 05:44.427
The last time my mom told me
I was gonna get a surprise,

05:44.510 --> 05:47.096
we took in this exchange student
from Guatemala,

05:47.180 --> 05:50.266
and I swear to god
he stole three of my skirts.

05:50.349 --> 05:53.478
- Well, this surprise
is not bad.

05:53.561 --> 05:55.480
- Why can't you tell us what--
[horn honks]

05:57.023 --> 05:59.942
- Hey. Over here.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.527

06:03.029 --> 06:04.322
DRIVER: Mr. Reese.

06:09.160 --> 06:10.203
- Hey, cool.
Your dad sent a van for us.

06:10.286 --> 06:13.039
- The van's for our suitcases.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.709
That's for us.

06:16.793 --> 06:17.794
[horn honks]

06:17.877 --> 06:18.419

06:20.713 --> 06:22.632

[screaming and exclamations]
MICHAEL: Look at this limo.

06:29.430 --> 06:31.015
- I wonder why he sent
the little one.

06:31.099 --> 06:33.684
- Little one?

06:33.768 --> 06:35.561
CHASE: That's not little.

06:35.645 --> 06:38.064
- It has a hot tub in the back.
It has a hot tub.

06:39.315 --> 06:41.109
- Would you look at that limo?

06:49.617 --> 06:50.535

- No. I grew up in a really big
house in Beverly Hills.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.834
We spend summers here.

Hey, Chauncey, why don't

07:53.431 --> 07:55.850
you show everybody their rooms?

and lookin' nice.

08:00.771 --> 08:02.231

08:05.484 --> 08:09.614

it's time for the surprise.

08:18.206 --> 08:19.373

your attention, please?

08:23.502 --> 08:26.714
I give you Logan's father,
Mr. Malcolm Reese.

08:29.383 --> 08:32.595
- Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, Dad.

08:34.179 --> 08:35.097
Yeah.

08:36.349 --> 08:37.933
This is
my assistant Kira.

08:38.017 --> 08:40.852
[all greeting]

08:40.937 --> 08:42.480
- Sit down.

08:44.106 --> 08:47.526
- Now, I'm sure you're
wondering why you're all here.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.737
- Um, aren't we here

But there's much more.

08:52.406 --> 08:54.784
- More?
- Much more.

08:54.867 --> 08:56.452
You see, I'm producing
a new reality show

08:56.535 --> 08:59.580
called
<i>Gender Defenders.</i>

08:59.664 --> 09:02.083
It's a competition to see
which sex is better,

09:02.166 --> 09:03.543
males...
- Or females.

09:03.626 --> 09:07.296
- Like we don't already know.
Ahh.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.006
- And where do we fit
into all this?

09:09.090 --> 09:10.299
- Well, before you can
make a TV show,

09:10.383 --> 09:11.592
you have to test it.

09:11.676 --> 09:14.637
And that's what you guys
are gonna do.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.889
We're gonna divide you up
into two teams--

09:16.973 --> 09:18.349
the guys versus the girls.

09:18.432 --> 09:19.976
And over the
next couple of days,

09:20.059 --> 09:21.894
you're gonna be pitted against
each other in a series of

09:21.978 --> 09:25.439
competitions that's gonna
test you on three levels:

09:25.523 --> 09:27.275
Mental, physical, and creative.

Oh, but wait a minute. I haven't
even told you the best part.

09:34.740 --> 09:38.661
The team that wins is comin'
back to Hollywood with me

09:38.744 --> 09:41.664
to compete on the very first
episode of <i>Gender Defenders.</i>

09:41.747 --> 09:43.499

put us on TV?

- No. He's gonna put us on TV.

- "No, he's gonna put us on TV."

This is good.

10:00.141 --> 10:01.017
Save it for the competition.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.352
Now, to say thanks
in advance

10:03.436 --> 10:06.480

10:06.564 --> 10:09.567
I'd like to give you all
a small gift.

- What are Tekmates?

10:27.668 --> 10:29.587
- What aren't Tekmates?

10:29.670 --> 10:30.880
- Oh, they're a cell phone,

10:30.963 --> 10:32.923
an address book, mp3 player.

10:33.007 --> 10:36.218
- They do emails,
text messaging, web access.

10:36.302 --> 10:37.386
- And we really
get to keep 'em?

10:37.470 --> 10:39.347
- Oh, yeah.
And during the competition,

10:39.430 --> 10:40.556
you're free to use 'em
to communicate

10:40.639 --> 10:43.559
with your other teammates.
Oh. And I forgot--

10:43.642 --> 10:46.312
each side is gonna need
to pick a team captain.

10:46.395 --> 10:47.646
- Zoey?
- Sure.

10:47.730 --> 10:49.815
- And I'll be the guys'
team captain.

10:49.899 --> 10:51.567
- Well, I think that Chase
should be our team captain.

10:51.650 --> 10:53.944
- Ok. Then we'll put it
to a vote.

10:54.028 --> 10:55.196
All of those
in favor of me--

10:55.279 --> 10:55.696
ALL: Chase.

10:57.698 --> 10:58.449
- Jerks.

10:58.532 --> 10:59.700
- Ok.
Team captains,

10:59.784 --> 11:02.536
these are the rules
of the competition.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.121
You two should meet in
the courtyard at 10 p.m.

11:04.205 --> 11:04.747
to go over them.

11:07.249 --> 11:08.876
- Cool.
- Thanks.

11:10.461 --> 11:11.921
- Did you guys have any idea
about this?

11:12.004 --> 11:13.297
- We might get to be on TV.

11:13.381 --> 11:16.092
- How great is my dad?

11:16.175 --> 11:17.551
- What?

11:17.635 --> 11:21.263
- You and Zoey alone
in the courtyard?

11:21.347 --> 11:23.849
Underneath the moonlight?
- So?

11:23.933 --> 11:25.643
- So it's the perfect time for
you to tell Zoey you love her.

11:25.726 --> 11:28.270
- Man, when are you gonna stop
with that?

11:28.354 --> 11:30.314
Is there an "off"
button on you anywhere?

11:30.398 --> 11:31.607
- [laughing]
Stop it. Stop.

11:31.690 --> 11:34.276
Dude, stop. I'm ticklish.
- Look, I told you.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.694
My friendship with Zoey
is too important.

11:35.778 --> 11:37.613
I'm not gonna risk messing it up
by telling her how I feel.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.699
- That's insane, man.
Listen.

11:40.783 --> 11:42.910
I'm tellin' you
all you gotta do

11:42.993 --> 11:45.204
is just go to Zoey and say--
dude, stop.

11:45.287 --> 11:46.122
I--I'm not--wait.

11:46.205 --> 11:47.289
- You like that?
- Dude, stop.

11:47.373 --> 11:49.417
- You like it? You like it?
- Stop. Dude.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.835
- I hope you like it.
- Seriously, stop.

11:50.918 --> 11:53.003
- Is this a good experience?
- [laughing] Stop. Stop. Dude.

12:04.807 --> 12:09.061
- May I get you anything,
Mr. Chase?

12:09.145 --> 12:13.107
- No. No, thank you.
I'm just, uh, waiting for Zoey.

12:13.190 --> 12:14.817
- Very good, sir.

12:17.820 --> 12:19.697
- [imitating]
Very good, sir.

12:21.407 --> 12:23.909
Very good, Mr. Chase.

12:26.954 --> 12:27.788
- Pardon?

12:27.872 --> 12:29.915
- Uh, I was--
[chuckles]

12:29.999 --> 12:32.334
I was just tryin' out a British
accent, you know, to--

12:32.418 --> 12:33.335
[cell phone beeps]

12:33.419 --> 12:35.337
Oh. I'm beeping.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.840
It's my new Tekmate.

12:37.923 --> 12:39.884
It's a text message
from my friend Michael.

12:39.967 --> 12:42.344
He's, uh,
he's upstairs.

12:42.428 --> 12:44.597
- That's so interesting.

12:44.680 --> 12:48.058
I shall go write
about it in my blog.

12:53.314 --> 12:53.856
- "Look up."

12:56.942 --> 12:57.693
- Over here.

12:57.776 --> 13:00.362
- [whispering]
What?

13:00.446 --> 13:03.949
- Tell Zoey
you love her.

13:06.911 --> 13:06.952
[beep]

13:10.247 --> 13:11.582
- For the billionth--

13:13.792 --> 13:18.214
"For the billionth time, no.

13:18.297 --> 13:22.718
"If I tell Zoey I love her,

13:22.801 --> 13:26.555
it could wreck our friendship."

13:27.973 --> 13:29.141
- Hi.

13:29.225 --> 13:30.851
- Oh. Zoey. Hey.

13:32.102 --> 13:33.395
- So, you wanna go
over these rules?

13:33.479 --> 13:34.855
- Uh, sure.

14:12.017 --> 14:14.061
- Hey, Quinn. What you makin'?
- A new energy drink.

14:14.144 --> 14:18.107
- But they already have,
like, a million energy drinks.

14:18.190 --> 14:20.109
- Yes, and they're all full
of chemicals and bad things,

14:20.192 --> 14:24.613
which is why I'm creating
an all-natural energy drink

14:24.697 --> 14:26.407
made of plant extracts,
fruit emulsions,

14:26.490 --> 14:28.534
and other natural things
I've squeezed.

14:28.617 --> 14:30.619
I call it Frazz.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.746
- Frazz?
- Uh-huh.

14:32.830 --> 14:35.040
Frazz will be 100% healthy,

14:35.124 --> 14:36.917
and it'll give you
17 times more energy

14:37.001 --> 14:39.253
than any other drink
on the market.

14:39.336 --> 14:40.838
- So is it ready?

14:40.921 --> 14:43.799
- Not yet.
It's too powerful.

14:43.882 --> 14:45.884
So now I have to figure out
a way to make it weaker

14:45.968 --> 14:48.262
but still maintain
the yummy flavor.

14:48.345 --> 14:49.555
- You'll figure it out.

14:49.638 --> 14:51.348
Hey,
I'm gonna go in the hot tub.

14:51.432 --> 14:53.058
Wanna come?
- Sure.

14:53.142 --> 14:54.184
- Hey.

14:54.268 --> 14:55.477
- Oh. Hey, Dustin.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.146
Wanna come hot-tub with us?

14:57.229 --> 14:58.606
- Nah. I'm too tired.

14:58.689 --> 15:00.357
I think
I'm just gonna get some juice

15:00.441 --> 15:01.358
and go to bed.
- Ok. Night.

15:01.442 --> 15:03.485
- Ciao.

15:17.291 --> 15:18.667
- "Frazz"?

15:25.633 --> 15:27.885
Ooh, that's good stuff.

15:51.742 --> 15:53.202
Yeah. I love this.

15:53.285 --> 15:58.040
It's like climbing stairs,
but it never stops.

15:58.123 --> 16:01.168
Ha ha ha ha ha. Yeah.
Stairs rock!

16:03.212 --> 16:06.006
[laughing]

16:22.147 --> 16:24.066
<i>- What's the big deal about</i>
<i>Pafloobian lemonade?</i>

16:24.149 --> 16:26.276
<i>- Pafloobian lemonade</i>
<i>is rumored to be</i>

16:26.360 --> 16:30.656
<i>the most delicious beverage</i>
<i>in the entire galaxy.</i>

16:30.739 --> 16:31.740

16:31.824 --> 16:34.284

16:36.412 --> 16:37.371
- What's up?

16:37.454 --> 16:39.164
<i>- Oh, yeah.</i>

16:39.248 --> 16:39.915
- Hello.

16:39.998 --> 16:41.542
- Man, you woke up early.

16:41.625 --> 16:42.126
- Yeah.

16:44.753 --> 16:47.631
- So? How was last night?

16:47.715 --> 16:49.508
- What do you mean?

16:49.591 --> 16:50.592
- Did you tell Zoey
you love her?

16:50.676 --> 16:53.429
- No, man. I've told you
a thousand times

16:53.512 --> 16:54.346
I'm not telling her.

16:54.430 --> 16:56.014
Didn't you read
my text message?

16:56.098 --> 16:58.809
- What text message?
- Uh, on your Tekmate?

16:58.892 --> 16:59.852
The one I sent you
after you messaged me?

16:59.935 --> 17:01.729
- You didn't message me back.

17:01.812 --> 17:03.147
- Yeah, I did.

17:06.191 --> 17:09.403
Look, man, I wrote
"For the billionth time, no.

17:09.486 --> 17:12.698
If I tell Zoey I love her,
it could wreck our friendship."

17:12.781 --> 17:14.241
- Uh, I didn't get
that message.

17:14.324 --> 17:15.492
- Well, I sent it.

17:15.576 --> 17:16.034
- Let me see.

17:20.539 --> 17:22.165
Uh...
[exhales]

17:22.249 --> 17:24.084
You didn't send
that message to me.

17:24.167 --> 17:25.377
- I didn't?

17:25.461 --> 17:26.753
- No.
[chuckles]

17:26.837 --> 17:29.465
- Then who did I send it to?

17:29.548 --> 17:31.383
- Zoey.

17:31.467 --> 17:36.180
- Z--Zoey?

17:36.263 --> 17:39.099
Zoey? Oh, my god.

17:39.183 --> 17:41.393
Oh, my god.

17:41.477 --> 17:42.978
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

17:43.061 --> 17:46.982
Oh, my god. Michael.
Oh, my god.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.443
[muffled screaming]
- Chase, Chase.

17:49.526 --> 17:50.652
No. Be quiet.

17:50.736 --> 17:51.695
- [screaming]
- People are sleeping.

17:51.779 --> 17:53.906
This is not your house.
- Oh, my god.

17:57.326 --> 17:59.244
- This is bad.
This is so, so bad.

17:59.328 --> 18:02.206
- But you don't know for sure
it's bad.

18:02.289 --> 18:04.082
- You don't think it's bad if
Zoey finds out I love her

18:04.166 --> 18:07.044
from a text message?
- All right, look.

18:07.127 --> 18:08.796
Uh, she didn't have her Tekmate
with her

18:08.879 --> 18:09.755
last night when you guys talked,
right?

18:09.838 --> 18:11.298
- That was last night.

18:11.381 --> 18:13.801
I'm sure she read it
when she woke up this morning.

18:13.884 --> 18:16.011
- Maybe not.
Gimme your Tekmate.

18:20.098 --> 18:22.684
Ha. See?
"Message unread."

18:22.768 --> 18:23.227
She hasn't seen it yet.

18:25.813 --> 18:28.524
- You sure?
- Yes.

18:28.607 --> 18:31.026
- Ok. Good.

18:31.109 --> 18:33.570
I just have to make sure
she never sees it.

18:33.654 --> 18:35.823
- Then all you gotta do is
sneak her Tekmate away from her

18:35.906 --> 18:38.909
and delete it.
- Gentlemen. If you're hungry--

18:38.992 --> 18:40.244
- Where's Zoey?

18:40.327 --> 18:41.954
- Having breakfast.

18:49.545 --> 18:50.838
- [sighs]

18:53.465 --> 18:56.885
Can you imagine growing up
in a house like this?

18:56.969 --> 18:57.886
- I know.
It's insane.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.555
Hey, will you pass me
the blueberries?

18:59.638 --> 19:01.390
- Yeah.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.351
- Thank you.

19:04.434 --> 19:05.727
- I wonder why
they call 'em blueberries.

19:05.811 --> 19:08.146
- What do you mean?

19:08.230 --> 19:10.649
- They're purple, not blue.

19:10.732 --> 19:12.484
[both chuckle]

19:12.568 --> 19:14.736
- Yeah.
That's true.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.029
You know, I don't even think
there are any blue foods.

19:16.113 --> 19:17.698
- There must be
some blue foods.

19:17.781 --> 19:19.867
- Try to name one.

19:19.950 --> 19:24.121
- Ok. Um, let's see.
Um...

19:24.955 --> 19:26.999
- Who touched my Frazz?

19:27.082 --> 19:29.585
- What?
- What's the matter?

19:29.668 --> 19:31.253
- My Frazz is gone.

19:32.337 --> 19:33.589
- What is Frazz?

19:33.672 --> 19:34.923
- The energy drink I'm creating.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.758
This bottle was full
of it last night.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.135
- Hey. You guys seen Dustin?

19:38.218 --> 19:40.095
- He's probably asleep
in his bed.

19:40.178 --> 19:41.972
- Uh-uh.
- We just checked his room.

19:42.055 --> 19:43.390
- His bed hasn't been slept in.

19:44.683 --> 19:45.225
- What if he drank my Frazz?

19:47.895 --> 19:49.313
- Dustin.

19:49.396 --> 19:49.855
BOTH: Dustin.

19:49.938 --> 19:52.900
ALL: Dustin!

20:00.532 --> 20:01.450
- [laughs]

20:01.533 --> 20:03.118
Jackpot.

20:04.369 --> 20:07.497
Aah. [gasps]
What are you doin'?

20:08.498 --> 20:09.666
- This close.

20:09.750 --> 20:12.377
I was this close to getting
Zoey's Tekmate.

20:12.461 --> 20:14.504
- Well, what happened?

20:14.588 --> 20:16.131
- I got Frazzed.

20:16.214 --> 20:19.134
ALL: Dustin.
- Dustin!

20:19.217 --> 20:21.762
- Dustin...
- Dustin!

20:21.845 --> 20:22.804
- Dustin!
- Dustin!

20:22.888 --> 20:24.806
- Dust?
- Dustin!

20:24.890 --> 20:27.935
- Hey, buckteeth.
ALL: Dustin, Dustin!

20:28.018 --> 20:31.104
BOTH: Dustin!
- Dustin?

20:31.521 --> 20:32.439
Dustin?

20:33.523 --> 20:34.566
Dustin?

20:35.901 --> 20:39.905
- [laughing]

20:39.988 --> 20:41.281
- Dustin?

20:42.449 --> 20:45.494
- Hi, Zoey. Hi, Quinn.
What are you guys doing?

20:45.577 --> 20:47.454
I'm just here on the stair
machine climbin' and climbin'.

20:47.537 --> 20:49.998
I really feel like I'm getting
good exercise.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.333
Have you guys had breakfast yet?
What'd ya have?

20:51.416 --> 20:54.670
I'm not really hungry.
This is really fun.

20:54.753 --> 20:56.672
[laughing]

20:56.755 --> 20:58.882
- He drank my Frazz.

20:58.966 --> 20:59.883
- How long have you
been climbing like that?

20:59.967 --> 21:01.093
- Since last night.

21:01.176 --> 21:03.929
Look. I've already climbed...

21:04.680 --> 21:07.349
Over 22,000 stairs. Yeah!

21:08.934 --> 21:10.769
- What is in your Frazz?

21:10.852 --> 21:11.853
- Calm down.
It's all natural.

21:11.937 --> 21:14.356
- That's not natural.

21:14.439 --> 21:16.900
- Ohh. The effect should wear
off in a few hours.

21:16.984 --> 21:18.527
- [cackling]

21:18.610 --> 21:18.944
- Or weeks.

21:19.027 --> 21:20.696
- Weeks?

21:20.779 --> 21:22.739
- I'm just a person.

21:22.823 --> 21:25.200
- Come on, you guys, the first
event's about to start.

21:25.283 --> 21:27.536
- All right.
<i>Gender Defenders!</i>

21:27.619 --> 21:30.247
Yeah.

21:31.832 --> 21:35.627
[laughing]

21:40.799 --> 21:43.385
- Ohh!

21:43.468 --> 21:45.721
- Ok. As you know,
<i>Gender Defenders</i>

21:45.804 --> 21:47.931
will be a series
of competitions.

21:48.015 --> 21:49.433
Now, when we
make the actual TV show,

21:49.516 --> 21:50.392
we'll have cameras to
record everything.

21:50.475 --> 21:53.687
But since this is
only a test run,

21:53.770 --> 21:56.148
it's just gonna be
you guys, me, Kira,

21:56.231 --> 21:58.734
and our three judges.

21:58.817 --> 22:01.611
[cheering and applause]

22:03.572 --> 22:06.950
- Dude, Zoey's wearin'
her Tekmate.

22:07.034 --> 22:08.994
- I know.

22:09.077 --> 22:11.246
- She read your message?

22:11.329 --> 22:12.414
- Nope.

22:12.497 --> 22:16.251
It still says
"message unread."

22:16.334 --> 22:18.378
- So, uh, what
are you gonna do?

22:18.462 --> 22:19.921
- I'm gonna wait
till she's not looking,

22:20.005 --> 22:21.840
sneak her Tekmate
off of her hip,

22:21.923 --> 22:25.427
delete the message,
and put it back.

22:25.510 --> 22:27.846
- Your first competition
will be mental.

22:27.929 --> 22:30.057
- A scavenger hunt.

22:30.140 --> 22:31.475
- What's a scavenger hunt?
What is it?

22:31.558 --> 22:33.435
Somebody, tell me
what a scavenger hunt is.

22:33.518 --> 22:36.438
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

22:36.521 --> 22:38.982
- You see those two safes
over there?

22:39.066 --> 22:41.109
The red safe is for the girls,

22:41.193 --> 22:43.236
and the blue safe
is for the boys.

22:43.320 --> 22:45.280
KIRA: The only way
to open the safe

22:45.363 --> 22:47.282
is to have the proper
3-digit combination.

22:47.365 --> 22:50.035
- Each captain will wait
by the safe

22:50.118 --> 22:52.913
while their teammates
use the clues to search

22:52.996 --> 22:54.414
for the three digits.

22:54.498 --> 22:56.458
- Once a team
has all three digits,

22:56.541 --> 22:57.959
they must deliver
the combination

22:58.043 --> 22:59.419
to their captain
to open their safe.

22:59.503 --> 23:02.214
- And the winner of the event
will be

23:02.297 --> 23:04.800
whichever team captain
opens his or her safe

23:04.883 --> 23:07.969
and brings me the item inside.

23:08.053 --> 23:11.598
- Your first clues are in the
envelopes taped to your safes.

23:11.681 --> 23:12.808
Ready?

23:12.891 --> 23:15.143
- And go.

23:15.227 --> 23:16.186
[Malcolm blows horn]

23:16.269 --> 23:20.482
[excited screaming]

23:20.565 --> 23:20.607
- Hurry.

23:24.236 --> 23:25.112
- Come on, man, open it.

23:25.195 --> 23:26.404
- I am.
- Come on.

23:26.488 --> 23:27.948
- Come on. The girls are
about to open it.

23:28.031 --> 23:29.199
- Read it, read it, hurry!

23:29.282 --> 23:31.034
- Ok. It says,
"Lola's the secret

23:31.118 --> 23:32.327
"to finding your first number.

23:32.410 --> 23:33.829
Think under her head
at night when she slumbers."

23:33.912 --> 23:37.124
- "To find your first digit,
here's the way how.

23:37.207 --> 23:39.835
Just look underneath
the juice of a cow."

23:39.918 --> 23:41.128
- "The juice of a cow"?

23:41.211 --> 23:42.129
- What's cow juice?

23:42.212 --> 23:43.171
- "At night when she slumbers."

23:43.255 --> 23:43.839
"Under her head."
Um...

23:43.922 --> 23:44.840
- Her pillow.

23:44.923 --> 23:47.175
[girls scream]

23:47.259 --> 23:49.010
- Milk.
- Milk? Milk.

23:49.094 --> 23:51.513
- Refrigerator. Come on.

23:51.596 --> 23:53.557
- Michael.
I have a problem.

23:54.933 --> 23:56.268
- Later.

24:02.732 --> 24:04.776
[girls screaming]

24:04.860 --> 24:06.027
- Go.
- Go, girl.

24:06.111 --> 24:07.445
- We gotta find it.

24:07.529 --> 24:08.488
- Find it.

24:08.572 --> 24:09.739
[screaming]

24:09.823 --> 24:11.867
- Aah. Aah.
Fourteen.

24:11.950 --> 24:12.534
Fourteen.

24:12.617 --> 24:14.202
- Okay, okay, okay.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.537
The first number is 14.

24:15.620 --> 24:17.539
- Good. Now open it
and read our next clue.

24:17.622 --> 24:22.169
- Um..."Your second digit
is now what you need.

24:22.252 --> 24:23.378
"So look in a place where

24:23.461 --> 24:25.088
you cook with great speed."

24:25.172 --> 24:26.131
- Ok, ok, uh...

24:26.214 --> 24:27.841
"Cook with great speed."

24:27.924 --> 24:29.176
- Oh, France.

24:29.259 --> 24:31.094
- Yes, Nicole.
Now we all run to France.

24:31.178 --> 24:33.096
- A microwave.

24:33.180 --> 24:36.099
[all screaming]

24:41.605 --> 24:44.816
- Where's the milk.
- Here, 27.

24:44.900 --> 24:46.318
- Twenty-seven.
Ok.

24:46.401 --> 24:47.068
So our first number is 27.

24:47.152 --> 24:48.528
- Read the next clue.

24:48.612 --> 24:52.407
- Uh,
"To learn your next number,

24:52.490 --> 24:54.284
"you don't need a teacher.

24:54.367 --> 24:56.119
You just need
to visit an adorable creature."

24:56.203 --> 24:58.580
- "Adorable creature"?

24:58.663 --> 25:01.082
- Lisa Lillian. Ha ha.
- Who's Lisa Lillian?

25:01.166 --> 25:04.294
- This adorable girl who used
to live down the street from me.

25:04.377 --> 25:06.630
Man, she had these teeth--
- Focus, dude.

25:06.713 --> 25:07.923
- Hey, didn't you say your dad
has a pet rabbit?

25:08.006 --> 25:09.841
- Yeah?

25:09.925 --> 25:10.383
- "Adorable creature"?

25:10.467 --> 25:11.843
- Yes. Come on.

25:21.019 --> 25:23.104
- Ok. Where's the microwave?

25:23.188 --> 25:25.523
- There.
- Aah!

25:25.607 --> 25:27.192
ALL: Seven.

25:27.275 --> 25:27.943
- Ok, only one more number
to go.

25:28.026 --> 25:30.070
- Open it.

25:30.153 --> 25:31.404
- Ok. Um, "For your final digit,

25:31.488 --> 25:33.865
"just look to the north
on the special red seat

25:33.949 --> 25:35.951
which flies back and forth."

25:36.034 --> 25:37.452
- Um...

25:37.535 --> 25:39.788
- "Flies back and forth."
What?

25:39.871 --> 25:40.497
Ok. "Final digit"...

25:40.580 --> 25:42.707
- What does that mean?

25:45.543 --> 25:47.420
- Hey, Cookie.
Twelve, twelve.

25:47.504 --> 25:49.798
- Twelve.
Ok, 12. We got 12.

25:49.881 --> 25:52.550
- There's one more number to go.
- Okay.

25:52.634 --> 25:55.637
"For your final digit,
just look to the north

25:55.720 --> 25:57.555
on a special blue seat
which flies back and forth."

25:59.808 --> 26:00.475
- What does that mean?

26:00.558 --> 26:01.726
- Which way's north?

26:03.603 --> 26:06.064
- What kind of seat
goes back and forth?

26:06.147 --> 26:06.982
- Other than a swing?

26:07.065 --> 26:09.276
- A swing.
- Let's go!

26:09.359 --> 26:10.652
[all screaming]

26:10.735 --> 26:13.029
- "A blue seat
that goes back and forth."

26:13.113 --> 26:14.990
Back--back and--

26:15.073 --> 26:15.657
- Do you own a swing set?

26:15.740 --> 26:16.992
- Swing set. Yes.

26:17.075 --> 26:18.493
- Come on.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.876
- Come on.

26:26.960 --> 26:28.211
[excited shouting]

26:28.295 --> 26:30.505
- Here.
- 36.

26:30.588 --> 26:32.090
all: 36.
- Okay, 36.

26:32.173 --> 26:33.675
So our combination is
27-12-36.

26:33.758 --> 26:36.177
Yeah. Just turn it,
and that'll work.

26:36.261 --> 26:38.972
[girls screaming]

- 21.
- Quick. Quick.

26:40.765 --> 26:42.100
[screaming]

26:42.183 --> 26:44.811
- Our combination is 14-7-21.
- You're the fastest.

26:44.894 --> 26:46.855
You take these numbers to Chase
so he can open the safe.

26:46.938 --> 26:49.065
- I'm not the fastest
when he's all full of Frazz.

26:49.149 --> 26:50.817
Look at him bouncing around.
- Yeah. Yeah. Gimme those.

26:50.900 --> 26:52.235
- All right.

26:52.319 --> 26:53.194
- Go, kid.

26:53.278 --> 26:55.363
- Which one of us
is the fastest?

26:55.447 --> 26:57.198
- Not me. I have an extra toe
on my right foot.

26:57.282 --> 26:58.533
- It doesn't matter.
We can't outrun the guys.

26:58.616 --> 27:00.910
- Oh. Tekmate.
- What about it?

27:00.994 --> 27:04.122
- We'll text-message
the combination to Zoey.

27:04.205 --> 27:05.040
- Quinn, you're brilliant.

27:05.123 --> 27:07.000
- Just do it.
- Ok. Here. Ok.

27:07.083 --> 27:09.878
14-7-21.

27:09.961 --> 27:12.255
- Well, come on. Let's go.
- And send.

- Hurry. Hurry up. Come on.

- All right, Chase, come on.

- 27...

27:45.955 --> 27:46.581
all: 12.

27:46.664 --> 27:48.583
- Turn the dial.
- 12...

27:48.666 --> 27:50.001
- 36.
Come on, open it.

27:50.085 --> 27:50.585
- Come on, hurry up.

27:50.668 --> 27:52.212

27:52.295 --> 27:53.171
- What is it? What is it?

27:53.254 --> 27:54.172
- Take it out.

27:54.255 --> 27:56.174
- Iced tea?

27:56.257 --> 27:57.717
- Well, just...

28:06.184 --> 28:08.103
- And the guys win the event.

28:08.186 --> 28:09.312
[cheering]

28:09.396 --> 28:12.857
- Oh, my god, yes.
Oh, my gosh. Oh, we got it.

28:12.941 --> 28:14.567
[shouting and laughter]

28:14.651 --> 28:16.277
- Thanks for just standin'
there, buddy.

28:16.361 --> 28:17.278
Thanks for standin' there.

28:17.362 --> 28:18.113
- You rock.

28:18.196 --> 28:20.824
- Ah!
- Did we win?

28:20.907 --> 28:23.034
- How could we win? You didn't
bring me the combination.

28:23.118 --> 28:23.743
- We text-messaged it to you.

28:26.204 --> 28:28.123
- Where's my Tekmate?

28:28.206 --> 28:29.791
- You had it when we started.

28:29.874 --> 28:33.128
- Here. I'll call
your phone number for you.

- Chase?

28:47.350 --> 28:50.019
- [chuckles]

28:50.103 --> 28:52.188
I, uh--I, uh...

28:52.272 --> 28:53.481
I found it.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.275
- You took Zoey's Tekmate?

28:55.358 --> 28:57.444
- Well, sorta.

28:57.527 --> 29:00.321
- That's cheating.

29:00.405 --> 29:01.197
- No, it's smart strategy.

29:01.281 --> 29:04.826
- It's cheating.

29:04.909 --> 29:06.828
- I can't believe you'd want
to win this way.

29:06.911 --> 29:08.163
- I don't.
- Now--now,

29:08.246 --> 29:09.414
Chase wouldn't cheat.

29:09.497 --> 29:10.457
- Well, Logan's dad said we

29:10.540 --> 29:12.208
could use our Tekmates
to communicate.

29:12.292 --> 29:14.544
- And Chase took it
to sabotage our communications.

29:14.627 --> 29:16.421
- No. I--I really didn't.

29:16.504 --> 29:17.922
- Then why'd you take it?

29:20.633 --> 29:21.843
- Just tell me why you took it,

29:21.926 --> 29:24.012
and I'll believe
you didn't cheat.

29:24.554 --> 29:27.056
Tell me why.

29:27.140 --> 29:30.351
- See? I told ya. He cheated.

29:30.435 --> 29:31.853
- I can't believe
you'd do this.

29:36.191 --> 29:37.775
- Zoey.

29:44.073 --> 29:44.908
- At least we won.

29:46.159 --> 29:47.285
- [sighs]

29:47.368 --> 29:48.203
- You're not gonna
disqualify the boys?

29:48.286 --> 29:50.330
- Well, I can't disqualify 'em.

29:50.413 --> 29:52.790
Logan's my son.

29:54.375 --> 29:55.627
Ooh, that's good tea.

30:04.886 --> 30:07.430
- Zoey. Zoey.

30:09.807 --> 30:12.227
Zoey, come on.

30:12.310 --> 30:16.022
- You're the last person in
the world I thought would cheat.

30:16.105 --> 30:17.065
- I didn't cheat.

30:17.148 --> 30:18.775
- You took my Tekmate.

30:18.858 --> 30:20.360
- I know. I did.

30:20.443 --> 30:22.278
- And that made us
lose the event.

30:22.362 --> 30:24.072
- I didn't mean for that
to happen.

30:24.155 --> 30:26.032
- All the girls think you did.

30:26.115 --> 30:27.659
- So? Just because they think
I'm a liar and a cheater,

30:27.742 --> 30:29.077
you have to think it, too?

30:29.160 --> 30:31.955
- Ok, don't try to turn this
around on me.

30:32.038 --> 30:33.081
- Look, I just can't believe
you would accuse me--

30:33.164 --> 30:34.707
- I'm not accusing you
of anything.

30:34.791 --> 30:37.252
I'm just saying,
tell me the truth.

30:37.335 --> 30:38.336
Tell me why you
took my Tekmate,

30:38.419 --> 30:39.587
and I'll believe you.

30:42.549 --> 30:46.928
- I, uh--I can't.

30:47.011 --> 30:49.639
- [sighs] Why?
What are you hiding?

30:50.723 --> 30:53.560
- Zoey, I didn't cheat.

30:53.643 --> 30:56.688
You know I'm an honest guy.

30:56.771 --> 30:57.981
- Honest people
don't hide things.

31:00.858 --> 31:03.778
- And now you're
just walking away?

31:03.861 --> 31:03.945
- Yep.

31:06.906 --> 31:09.409
- So, what, does this mean,
we're not friends anymore?

31:25.341 --> 31:30.346
<i>MALCOLM: Your next event will</i>

31:30.430 --> 31:32.807
nerd makeovers.

31:32.890 --> 31:36.019
- Uh, hey, uh...
what's a nerd makeover?

31:36.102 --> 31:39.272
- It's when you give a nerd
a makeover.

31:39.355 --> 31:41.441
- [chuckles]
Ah.

31:42.358 --> 31:44.652

44:41.845 --> 44:46.058
And I had to
get your Tekmate away from you

44:46.141 --> 44:47.393
so that I could erase
the message

44:47.476 --> 44:49.269
before you read it.

44:49.353 --> 44:51.438
I tried to put it back,
but you ran off,

44:51.522 --> 44:53.941
so I couldn't.

44:55.150 --> 44:57.986
- Ok.

44:58.070 --> 45:00.489
- So do you believe me?

45:00.572 --> 45:02.032
- Should I not?

45:02.116 --> 45:03.951
- No, you--you should.

45:04.034 --> 45:05.285
- Then I do.

45:05.369 --> 45:07.246
- Ok.

45:07.329 --> 45:09.915
- So...
- Don't ask.

45:09.998 --> 45:12.626
- I'm asking.
- Zoey, seriously.

45:12.709 --> 45:15.295
- What was the message you sent
to me by mistake?

45:18.048 --> 45:20.134
Tell me.

45:20.217 --> 45:22.219
- I'd really rather not
tell ya.

45:22.302 --> 45:25.222
- Why, was it mean?
- Huh?

45:25.305 --> 45:27.349
- Did you say something mean
about me?

45:27.433 --> 45:28.350
- No. God, no.

45:28.434 --> 45:30.060
It was--it was
nothing like that.

45:30.144 --> 45:32.479
I'd never say
anything mean about you.

45:32.563 --> 45:33.814
- Then what could
you have written

45:33.897 --> 45:36.817
that was so important
to hide from me?

45:36.900 --> 45:40.362
What was the message?

45:40.446 --> 45:43.157
- You really wanna know?
- Yeah.

45:43.240 --> 45:44.533
- You're sure?

45:44.616 --> 45:45.909
- I really wanna know.

45:45.993 --> 45:48.120
- Ok.

45:48.203 --> 45:49.121
The message was...

45:49.204 --> 45:50.247
- You guys...

45:52.291 --> 45:53.709
- Guys, the show starts
in, like, 30 seconds.

45:53.792 --> 45:56.503
- And we're not lettin' you
miss it.

45:56.587 --> 45:58.338

- Come on. Come on.

45:58.422 --> 46:00.674
