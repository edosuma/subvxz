*** SONG LIVES FOR EVER ***

01:18.937 --> 01:20.407
That's something I don't see everyday.

01:20.407 --> 01:22.450
It's a car accident you'll be
seeing every couple of hours.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.215
No, this one in the ambulance,
she grabbed my scissors

01:24.215 --> 01:25.904
and started slashing her wrists.

01:26.144 --> 01:28.148
- Crazy!
- I had to sedate her.

02:00.411 --> 02:01.641
In ten...

02:01.666 --> 02:03.760
Nine, eight...

02:03.916 --> 02:07.380
Seven, six, five...

02:07.504 --> 02:09.472
Four, three...

02:09.681 --> 02:11.998
Two, one!

02:12.141 --> 02:13.780
Houston, we have a pregnancy.

02:13.780 --> 02:16.266
- Yes!
- Yes!

02:16.793 --> 02:19.621
Thank you so much for all
of your help, Captain.

02:20.834 --> 02:22.323
Thank you, my dear.

02:24.374 --> 02:25.667
I think we should try again, though...

02:26.157 --> 02:28.338
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

02:28.338 --> 02:30.764
Yeah? I think so too.

02:41.544 --> 02:42.573
Hey!

02:42.846 --> 02:43.919
You look nice today.

02:43.919 --> 02:45.647
- Thanks!
- Anything going on?

02:45.884 --> 02:47.726
Yeah, Jason's coming by.

02:48.400 --> 02:49.475
Jason?

02:49.730 --> 02:52.139
Yeah, I told you about him,
the seed money guy.

02:53.111 --> 02:55.484
Can't he just send a check?
Why does he have to come to the house?

02:56.015 --> 02:59.229
He wants to look at my set-up,
see how I operate.

02:59.649 --> 03:02.260
He wants to see your mad
scientist's laboratory?

03:04.637 --> 03:07.269
Or are you gonna knock his socks off?

03:07.523 --> 03:09.685
- Are you sure you don't want
some of this? - I'm good.

03:09.849 --> 03:12.041
Don't you worry because
once I'm pregnant,

03:12.208 --> 03:14.794
I'm gonna eat you out of house and home.

03:17.072 --> 03:18.975
All right, it will work Dad.

03:19.245 --> 03:22.784
Don't forget we have the appointment
with the fertility doctor today.

03:24.188 --> 03:25.735
- Right.
- Hmm.

03:25.828 --> 03:29.391
Didn't we, like, just have sex
two or three times just now?

03:29.416 --> 03:31.454
- I think that's how, traditionally,
you get pregnant. - Mhm.

03:31.477 --> 03:33.988
- I don't need his help.
- It's a her.

03:34.299 --> 03:36.201
Dr. Bianca Hartlin.

03:36.251 --> 03:37.630
And she's the best.

03:37.770 --> 03:39.761
It usually takes months to
get an appointment but,

03:39.761 --> 03:41.597
for some reason, I got
an appointment two days

03:41.597 --> 03:43.225
after I filled out
the application.

03:43.225 --> 03:46.037
- That must be a sign.
- That's fantastic. - Hmm.

03:46.828 --> 03:48.537
Do you know if she takes our insurance?

03:49.564 --> 03:52.838
No, honey, it's not covered by
insurance, it's out of pocket.

03:52.838 --> 03:54.598
Hey, if she's the best...

03:54.740 --> 03:56.254
Then it's worth it.

03:56.971 --> 04:00.407
And I want you to know that I love you
very much even if we can't have a baby.

04:00.582 --> 04:02.078
I love you too.

04:02.202 --> 04:04.088
And we are gonna have a baby.

04:04.264 --> 04:05.843
- Together.
- OK.

04:05.843 --> 04:07.368
- Deal?
- Deal!

04:09.577 --> 04:11.523
Have a good day.

04:11.928 --> 04:14.033
I thought you weren't hungry,
you ate all my bacon.

04:27.399 --> 04:29.969
Well, I thought the deal was that after the
first thousand bottles,

04:29.969 --> 04:31.113
 the price would...

04:41.597 --> 04:42.938
Excuse me, erm...

04:42.938 --> 04:46.049
I can send you a copy of our
contract, if you can't find it.

04:46.846 --> 04:48.928
Great.
I'm glad that won't be necessary.

04:48.992 --> 04:51.802
Why don't you re-read it,
and then we talk? OK?

04:52.207 --> 04:54.179
All right, thank you.
Good-bye.

05:05.393 --> 05:08.182
Cancel the order.
Exclamation point.

05:08.666 --> 05:10.125
You caught me!

05:10.125 --> 05:12.550
- Aw... it's good to see you!
- It's good to see you too, Layla.

05:13.215 --> 05:15.748
- You smell so nice.
- Well, coming from you, I'll take it!

05:15.748 --> 05:17.560
Thank you, it's great to
see you on your own turf.

05:17.560 --> 05:18.944
Oh, you sweet!

05:18.969 --> 05:21.899
- You have a beautiful place.
- Thanks! I like it too.

05:21.899 --> 05:24.049
So, there was a mention on
the phone, Shannon Reid...

05:24.049 --> 05:25.044
The reality star.

05:25.044 --> 05:28.134
That's the one. She's interested in licensing
one of your fragrances under her name.

05:28.134 --> 05:30.376
For her to rev a little stream
without all the responsibilities.

05:30.376 --> 05:33.368
Yeah, I get that. I've been in the
fragrance industry a really long time.

05:33.368 --> 05:34.595
- Of course, you have.
- I understand.

05:34.595 --> 05:37.639
- OK, so, show me where the magic
happens. - OK, let's go. - Let's go see.

05:46.320 --> 05:49.448
- All right, so...
- Let's see it! - Here it is!

05:49.448 --> 05:50.487
Wow!

05:50.487 --> 05:52.541
Is that...?
What is that?

05:52.869 --> 05:54.835
It's called a perfume organ.

05:54.860 --> 05:55.667
OK.

05:55.667 --> 05:58.881
Yeah, it's an antique, and I love
it so much more than a lab table.

06:00.250 --> 06:01.250
Go on.

06:01.369 --> 06:03.109
- Try smelling one.
- Hmm.

06:03.437 --> 06:06.559
One of the reasons I went off on my own,
is because I design everything myself,

06:06.559 --> 06:08.820
and I don't so consumer testing.

06:09.105 --> 06:12.611
Each fragrance has to be unique
and specific to the wearer.

06:12.636 --> 06:14.470
Of course, I wanna sell more but...

06:14.591 --> 06:16.018
I don't wanna diminish my quality.

06:16.018 --> 06:18.170
And that's exactly why Shannon
wants to work with you.

06:18.170 --> 06:20.658
She got from her brand just as
much as you got out of yours.

06:20.658 --> 06:21.962
And I mean...

06:21.962 --> 06:24.151
Typically perfume and
cologne sell at about...

06:24.151 --> 06:25.613
$150 a bottle.

06:25.613 --> 06:30.134
And Shannon has a millions of fans
from her show "Shannon Ball" so...

06:30.134 --> 06:31.525
You do the Maths.

06:31.525 --> 06:34.407
No, I've already done the Maths which is
why I'm gonna throw some money into this.

06:34.407 --> 06:36.254
- I think it's good business.
- It is.

06:36.804 --> 06:39.424
Yes! Good, good, good, good.
OK, so...

06:39.449 --> 06:41.790
I'm gonna have my office set something
up where the three of us can meet,

06:41.815 --> 06:43.833
and we'll talk.
Sound good?

06:44.783 --> 06:46.221
- Deal.
- Deal!

06:46.400 --> 06:48.109
A deal!
I'm gonna hold you to it!

06:48.109 --> 06:50.516
- I'll see you soon.
- OK.

06:50.969 --> 06:52.906
"Shannon Ball"...

07:07.711 --> 07:09.648
Look at his little guys.

07:10.182 --> 07:12.240
Do you think our is going to be as cute?

07:12.650 --> 07:14.076
I'm so nervous.

07:14.728 --> 07:16.720
Hey, don't be!

07:17.447 --> 07:21.119
You're gonna have a fantastic experience
and make a beautiful baby.

07:30.457 --> 07:32.230
Hi, I'm doctor Bianca Hartlin.

07:32.230 --> 07:34.182
- Layla.
- Hey, Nate.

07:34.182 --> 07:35.587
Please, sit down.

07:35.612 --> 07:36.612
Thanks.

07:37.052 --> 07:38.091
So...

07:38.350 --> 07:40.861
I had a chance to go over
your medical records,

07:40.861 --> 07:42.537
and I think you made the right choice.

07:42.708 --> 07:45.461
Given your inability
to conceive, so far...

07:45.560 --> 07:47.330
And your age...

07:47.776 --> 07:51.394
My recommendation is
definitely an embryo implant.

07:51.394 --> 07:53.519
So, you'd harvest my eggs,

07:53.519 --> 07:56.130
mix it with Nate's sperm
and create the embryo?

07:56.130 --> 07:57.355
Exactly!

07:58.364 --> 08:00.585
- All right.
- I'm willing to do it.

08:01.678 --> 08:03.437
How about you, Mr. King?

08:04.773 --> 08:06.545
So, what do you mean?

08:06.545 --> 08:08.298
This is a team effort.

08:09.276 --> 08:12.433
The insemination process and the
pregnancy are a lot of work.

08:12.542 --> 08:14.376
Layla can't do it by herself.

08:14.462 --> 08:16.758
No, no, no. I'm on board 100 per cent.

08:16.758 --> 08:20.380
Absolutely.
For sure, yeah, for sure.

08:20.380 --> 08:22.458
We will want one of those
happy babies, though.

08:22.458 --> 08:24.084
That guy up on the left there.

08:24.084 --> 08:26.285
Wonderful!
Great!

08:26.285 --> 08:29.234
I'll start your new routine of
intensive hormone injections,

08:29.234 --> 08:30.796
and then, when you're ready,

08:30.796 --> 08:33.041
I'll cultivate your eggs,
mix them with

08:33.041 --> 08:35.111
your sperm, Mr. King,

08:35.135 --> 08:37.703
Do... do you need that, like, tonight?

08:37.703 --> 08:40.530
No, she doesn't need it
til she harvests my eggs.

08:40.534 --> 08:42.073
- I don't know.
- Silly.

08:42.178 --> 08:44.674
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to step in.

08:44.725 --> 08:48.099
That's all right.
I'm glad that you're well informed.

08:48.408 --> 08:52.965
So, we'll set up a date for you to
visit our collection lab downstairs...

08:52.965 --> 08:56.568
On the same day, we'll
harvest Miss Talbot's eggs.

08:56.593 --> 08:59.566
- All right?
- That's great. - Perfect!

08:59.591 --> 09:02.992
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you. - Thanks, thanks.

09:05.953 --> 09:07.755
So? What do you think?

09:08.028 --> 09:09.469
I love her.

09:09.494 --> 09:12.343
And I think we're going to have a baby.

09:15.183 --> 09:16.790
All good!

09:20.602 --> 09:23.333
- OK, sounds great. Can you
text me the address? - Sure!

09:23.333 --> 09:27.078
And please let Jason know that
I'm looking forward to seeing...

09:27.545 --> 09:30.268
- Sorry, can you hold on? I have
another call. - No problem.

09:30.848 --> 09:34.320
- Hello! - Hey, it's Jim, I think someone's
breaking into your house. - What?

09:34.320 --> 09:36.881
Yeah, you should
probably head back here.

09:48.657 --> 09:49.887
Allison?

09:51.710 --> 09:53.801
What's going on, step-mom?

09:53.801 --> 09:55.705
Are you breaking into my house?

10:00.352 --> 10:02.755
- Yeah, you are.
- No. - You are!

10:02.780 --> 10:04.830
And you know, you can
just text me or your Dad

10:04.814 --> 10:06.511
and just let us know
when you're here.

10:06.561 --> 10:10.096
I don't wanna bother you guys.
Did a nosy neighbor call you?

10:10.213 --> 10:12.294
Is this about your
boyfriend or something?

10:12.294 --> 10:13.929
No, he's a jerk.

10:13.929 --> 10:17.176
It's about school,
it's just not really the right fit.

10:17.261 --> 10:19.696
Well, neither were the
last two, were they?

10:21.592 --> 10:23.958
Well, if this a problem,
I can crash at some friends'.

10:23.958 --> 10:26.352
I didn't say that.
You can stay here for now.

10:26.692 --> 10:27.692
Great!

10:27.960 --> 10:30.523
But, you know, when your Dad gets home,
we're gonna talk about it.

10:30.523 --> 10:32.272
- Cool!
- Cool.

10:40.058 --> 10:43.025
OK, here we go.
Are you ready for this?

10:43.485 --> 10:44.974
Absolutely.

10:45.338 --> 10:48.411
- Alcohol swab?
- OK, coming right up.

10:53.194 --> 10:54.306
Pen?

10:56.742 --> 10:59.794
All right, I'm gonna draw
a circle in my stomach.

11:00.578 --> 11:03.573
Now just... pinch he skin and...

11:03.783 --> 11:06.193
Put the needle right through
the center of the circle.

11:07.479 --> 11:09.628
- OK.
- OK!

11:09.675 --> 11:10.879
Like that?

11:10.904 --> 11:12.028
That's good.

11:12.028 --> 11:15.065
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready. Oh!

11:15.127 --> 11:17.179
- Sorry!
- OK!

11:19.621 --> 11:21.666
Ooooh! Ha, ha, ha...

11:21.720 --> 11:23.721
You can open your eyes now.

11:25.467 --> 11:28.442
Whoa! Are you like
senior citizen junkies?

11:29.928 --> 11:31.872
It's... it's a fertility shot.

11:32.936 --> 11:34.458
But you're old.

11:35.175 --> 11:35.967
That's hilarious.

11:35.967 --> 11:38.296
Well, that's why I'm taking shots.

11:39.428 --> 11:41.112
Can you, like, not do
it in the kitchen?

11:41.112 --> 11:43.348
How am I supposed to eat if
you're shooting up in here?

11:43.348 --> 11:47.756
Oh, well, I'm so sorry but we're not
used to someone living with us.

11:47.857 --> 11:50.611
Better get used to it if
you wanna have babies.

11:50.611 --> 11:52.842
By the way, that bedroom
is still full of baby stuff.

11:52.842 --> 11:54.956
I don't have room for any of my clothes.

11:55.022 --> 11:57.280
You know what? Beggars
can't be choosers, right?

11:58.817 --> 12:01.626
So, what are your plans,
by the way?

12:02.086 --> 12:02.852
Huh?

12:03.453 --> 12:05.417
Your plans, sweetheart,
what are they?

12:05.650 --> 12:08.411
I think what your Dad's asking is
are you looking for a job?

12:08.973 --> 12:10.105
A job?

12:10.136 --> 12:11.509
But I'm in college.

12:11.615 --> 12:13.940
But you're not in
college, though, right?

12:14.323 --> 12:15.679
You dropped out.

12:16.499 --> 12:19.437
- So, what are your plans? - Where
am I supposed to find a job, anyway?

12:19.749 --> 12:23.306
Hey, babe, you know, you've been saying
that you need some help at the club.

12:23.331 --> 12:24.560
- No way!
- What?

12:24.724 --> 12:27.839
- When did I say that? - I think you
could earn some money and then...

12:27.839 --> 12:29.698
You could get the help you need.

12:33.268 --> 12:35.186
OK, I've heard worst ideas, I guess.

12:35.186 --> 12:37.142
I haven't!
Who said I wanted to get a job?

12:37.142 --> 12:38.669
And also, think about this,

12:38.669 --> 12:41.794
it could be a father-daughter
bonding experience.

12:41.794 --> 12:43.466
I'll tell you something,
you want money?

12:43.466 --> 12:45.631
You want a job, OK?

12:45.631 --> 12:47.924
So, you can start
tomorrow morning at 7AM.

12:49.079 --> 12:51.472
I have some money saved.

12:51.472 --> 12:52.836
It's on my card!

12:56.083 --> 12:57.274
- What?
- Mhmm.

12:57.770 --> 12:59.313
Are you kidding me?

12:59.313 --> 13:00.586
Why?

13:00.586 --> 13:04.298
This is LA! How do you expect to get
anywhere, ever? Are you out of your mind?

13:04.298 --> 13:05.298
I'll borrow your car!

13:05.299 --> 13:07.699
OK, you know what?
You can just drive her to work.

13:09.113 --> 13:10.004
I c...

13:10.851 --> 13:13.281
OK, we'll deal with the
car thing another time.

13:13.281 --> 13:16.278
You, young lady, 6:30AM
tomorrow morning,

13:16.278 --> 13:19.362
I'm up and ready to go and I
expect you to be as well.

13:19.607 --> 13:20.789
OK.

13:21.579 --> 13:22.579
Great.

13:23.309 --> 13:24.879
Can I make you something to eat?

13:24.879 --> 13:27.609
Not after watching your
stuff with the needle.

13:33.009 --> 13:35.920
She was so cute when she was a baby,
you know? I don't know what happened.

13:35.920 --> 13:37.373
She's just a teenager.

13:37.886 --> 13:39.183
It's all right.

13:45.301 --> 13:49.024
I mean so, obviously, I'm trying to
capitalize on my show's ratings right now.

13:49.211 --> 13:52.344
And I wanna work with brands
that I can respect, so...

13:52.344 --> 13:55.989
- That's why I wanted to talk to you.
- I'm so flattered. Thank you.

13:56.014 --> 13:58.041
I do have one question, though...

13:58.165 --> 14:01.277
Why did you quit?
I mean, did anything go wrong?

14:02.327 --> 14:05.821
Now, I... I just didn't want to
work for a corporation anymore,

14:05.821 --> 14:07.935
and I wanted to go off on my own;

14:08.059 --> 14:09.816
And to be a mother.

14:09.816 --> 14:12.074
That's awesome.
How many kids do you have?

14:12.510 --> 14:14.142
Well, none yet.

14:14.142 --> 14:15.833
But my husband and I are working on it.

14:15.833 --> 14:17.574
Ooooh, very nice!

14:17.574 --> 14:20.601
Yeah, and then, once the baby comes,
then, I can work from home.

14:20.601 --> 14:24.617
See? I love that about you,
your passion for work and for motherhood.

14:24.729 --> 14:28.482
I mean, that's what inspires
me as love and passion.

14:28.482 --> 14:30.879
I mean, so many people
look up to me and...

14:30.879 --> 14:32.708
I don't wanna take that for granted.

14:32.762 --> 14:35.644
You know, so, one of these young
girls could look at me and think:

14:35.720 --> 14:37.758
"Hey, maybe I could do that".

14:38.257 --> 14:39.986
That is so beautiful.

14:39.986 --> 14:41.296
I agree.

14:41.514 --> 14:43.171
So, ladies?

14:44.009 --> 14:45.714
What do you think about all this?

14:46.066 --> 14:49.441
- I'm excited. - I am too! - Yes!
- Good, good, good!

14:49.441 --> 14:52.995
- See, didn't I tell you this was all
gonna work out? - You did, thank you.

15:26.872 --> 15:28.571
Hey, Jason,
what's going on?

15:28.596 --> 15:30.774
I just wanna let you know
that the meeting went great.

15:30.774 --> 15:33.949
- I'm so glad!
- Shannon was really impressed with you.

15:34.067 --> 15:36.468
Oh yeah, well, you know what?
She wasn't what I expected at all.

15:36.468 --> 15:37.737
No, Shannon's smart!

15:37.737 --> 15:41.146
I think the two of you are gonna
sell a lot of perfume together.

15:43.368 --> 15:45.356
Layla, Layla,
are you still there?

15:45.476 --> 15:48.683
Yeah, I thought I saw something outside,
I was just checking.

15:48.847 --> 15:52.307
OK, well, erm, be careful and...

15:52.439 --> 15:54.869
- Excellent work today.
- OK, bye-bye.

15:56.491 --> 15:58.386
- Oh!
- Sorry!

15:59.193 --> 16:00.861
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

16:00.861 --> 16:03.947
It's OK. I just got off
the phone with Jason.

16:03.947 --> 16:05.869
We were talking about Shannon Reid.

16:06.155 --> 16:07.612
- The reality show girl?
- Yeah.

16:07.612 --> 16:11.868
She's actually a very smart young lady
and she likes me a lot.

16:11.868 --> 16:14.712
- Oh, really?
- Yeah. - Well, who doesn't?

16:15.303 --> 16:16.971
You're a flatterer.

16:26.010 --> 16:28.260
So, how did it go?
Is everything all right?

16:29.639 --> 16:31.709
It couldn't have gone any better.

16:31.927 --> 16:33.546
Let me show you.

16:33.942 --> 16:35.398
As you can see..

16:35.398 --> 16:38.113
I inserted a needle through
the top of the vagina,

16:38.113 --> 16:40.276
and pull the oxide from
the follicle wall,

16:40.276 --> 16:41.634
with an aspirator needle.

16:41.634 --> 16:44.074
One follicle did release its egg early,

16:44.074 --> 16:47.254
but I was able to retrieve
six of your eggs this way.

16:47.975 --> 16:51.041
Wow, I'm so amazed by that.

16:51.604 --> 16:53.513
When will you implant the embryo?

16:53.838 --> 16:55.058
Soon...

16:55.058 --> 16:58.251
First, I have to mix your eggs
with your husband's sperm,

16:58.251 --> 16:59.572
Oh...

16:59.771 --> 17:02.584
- How is Nate doing with that?
- Collecting the sperm sample?

17:02.609 --> 17:03.685
Hmmmm.

17:03.685 --> 17:05.700
Fine,
I think.

17:05.700 --> 17:08.964
My assistant took him down to the sperm
collection lab when he got here.

17:09.190 --> 17:13.608
So, if everything goes well, in a couple
of days we'll implant the embryo.

17:13.723 --> 17:15.201
That's wonderful.

17:15.348 --> 17:17.894
Oh, I almost forgot!

17:18.530 --> 17:21.737
I... I made this for you.

17:22.084 --> 17:23.213
Layla?

17:24.310 --> 17:27.056
- You didn't have to.
- I know. I wanted to.

17:27.202 --> 17:28.979
Just a special scent made,

17:29.126 --> 17:31.630
just for you.
Seemed to suit you.

17:32.025 --> 17:33.240
Thank you.

17:33.681 --> 17:35.437
I will cherish that for ever.

17:35.437 --> 17:36.859
You're very welcome.

17:38.582 --> 17:40.461
I almost forgot to give
you your injection.

17:41.112 --> 17:43.309
Another one?
What's in this one?

17:43.334 --> 17:45.700
- Hormone enhancers.
- Oh.

17:45.789 --> 17:48.668
Just think of it as
pregnancy vitamins.

17:50.087 --> 17:51.087
Layla...

17:51.975 --> 17:53.908
I just want you to know that,

17:53.908 --> 17:57.374
I understand how important
it is to you to have a baby.

17:59.543 --> 18:01.837
It's just as important to me.

18:01.837 --> 18:02.907
All right?

18:03.931 --> 18:05.811
Now, let's get our shots.

18:12.370 --> 18:13.417
Thank you.

18:14.090 --> 18:15.704
Hey, Allison,
what are you doing here?

18:15.704 --> 18:17.956
I came with Dad,
he wants me to drive you home.

18:17.956 --> 18:19.723
That's so nice,
thanks.

18:19.748 --> 18:21.582
Like I had a choice.

18:21.800 --> 18:22.905
Hey!

18:22.905 --> 18:24.028
How did it go?

18:24.028 --> 18:27.563
Good! Erm... I'll see
you back at the course.

18:27.563 --> 18:29.986
- I can't wait.
- Drive safe, please.

18:30.919 --> 18:32.379
Get out of here.

19:12.797 --> 19:14.296
You've gotta be kidding me!

19:14.296 --> 19:17.483
These people are driving
me absolutely crazy.

19:17.483 --> 19:20.607
- Who? Shannon Reid?
- Yeah, she's blowing up my phone!

19:20.632 --> 19:22.736
You've been losing it a lot lately.

19:22.836 --> 19:25.361
Have I?
I guess it's these hormones.

19:25.361 --> 19:27.932
This whole fertility thing
seems like a lot of work.

19:27.932 --> 19:29.682
You've no idea.

19:29.860 --> 19:31.748
I'm surprised to see Dad so into it.

19:32.014 --> 19:33.959
- Why?
- I mean, he barely wanted to have me

19:33.959 --> 19:35.670
and now he wants to have
a kid when he's so old?

19:35.670 --> 19:37.359
OK, none of that's true.

19:37.359 --> 19:41.350
Your Dad loves you very
much and he's not so old.

19:44.398 --> 19:46.141
How is it working for
your Dad, by the way?

19:46.431 --> 19:48.042
- Truth?
- Yeah.

19:48.042 --> 19:50.860
It's hot and sweaty and I come
home smelling like grass.

19:52.182 --> 19:55.131
Well, all right. How do
you feel working for me?

19:55.264 --> 19:56.388
Doing what?

19:56.388 --> 19:57.990
Well, I need an assistant now.

19:57.990 --> 20:00.101
Just signed this contract, and I
got these Shannon Reid's people

20:00.101 --> 20:02.656
making me jump through
all these hoops, so...

20:02.681 --> 20:06.359
That's kind of cool,
I mean, golf really sucks.

20:06.658 --> 20:07.825
What do you think?

20:09.129 --> 20:11.236
- I have question.
- What?

20:11.613 --> 20:13.272
Can I borrow your car?

20:13.914 --> 20:15.069
Uhhh...

20:15.287 --> 20:17.866
- Yeah, I guess you can.
- Cool, thanks! Right now?

20:17.949 --> 20:21.785
- Yeah!
- Erm... OK! Bye!

20:24.758 --> 20:26.318
Unbelievable.

20:39.251 --> 20:40.673
- Oh!
- Whoa!

20:40.673 --> 20:43.609
- Jeez! - Are you OK? - Yeah, will
you watch where you're going?

20:43.609 --> 20:45.419
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to.

20:45.419 --> 20:47.710
- I was just trying to get
by you, I'm... - Sorry.

20:48.380 --> 20:50.571
Sorry, congratulations on your baby.

20:51.148 --> 20:53.786
Yeah, well, what's rude is rude.
So...

20:57.265 --> 20:58.438
Layla!

20:59.264 --> 21:00.800
Are you all right?

21:00.864 --> 21:02.376
Oh, doctor Hartlin!

21:02.376 --> 21:04.372
What are you doing here?
I didn't expect to see you!

21:04.372 --> 21:06.406
Please, call me Bianca.

21:06.406 --> 21:08.672
- Hi, what a nice surprise.
- Yeah.

21:08.672 --> 21:11.615
Well, am I glad you're here! I've
been having such an erratic morning.

21:11.644 --> 21:15.319
- Mood swings? - Yes, like a
roller-coaster, it's not like me.

21:15.319 --> 21:17.306
- Feel like punching someone?
- All the time.

21:17.343 --> 21:20.962
If you feel like hurting yourself,
we may wanna lower your dose.

21:20.962 --> 21:23.424
Oh, no, I don't wanna do that.
It's fine.

21:23.424 --> 21:24.463
All right.

21:24.463 --> 21:28.037
- What are you doing here?
- I'm shopping for some baby clothes.

21:28.819 --> 21:29.819
Are you...?

21:31.072 --> 21:33.737
No, no, no, it's for a friend of mine.

21:33.823 --> 21:37.131
As you can imagine,
I know a lot of people with babies.

21:37.225 --> 21:38.244
I'm sure!

21:38.244 --> 21:41.489
- Ain't that cute?
- It's a darling. Oh, OK...

21:42.603 --> 21:45.713
Can you stand that? Isn't
this the sweetest thing?

21:45.806 --> 21:47.036
Mhm.

21:48.136 --> 21:49.220
Yes.

21:54.666 --> 21:58.834
So, one of my friends told me that
a way to meet men was by golfing.

21:58.834 --> 22:01.383
So, I decided to take golf lessons.

22:01.663 --> 22:04.208
So you met Nate playing golf?

22:04.208 --> 22:08.453
Well, kind of, he was the golf
pro that I took lessons from.

22:08.907 --> 22:11.365
- How funny.
- Yeah.

22:11.397 --> 22:14.564
He'd been divorced a couple of years,
drink a little too much.

22:14.589 --> 22:16.567
But he cleaned up his act.

22:18.061 --> 22:19.948
He's a good husband.

22:19.948 --> 22:21.532
That's nice.

22:23.667 --> 22:25.683
You ever been married before?

22:25.872 --> 22:27.938
Actually, yes, I was.

22:27.938 --> 22:29.577
In my early 20's.

22:29.686 --> 22:32.851
But that didn't really work out, so...

22:34.282 --> 22:35.506
How about you?

22:36.604 --> 22:37.824
No.

22:37.824 --> 22:41.443
I had some long-term relationships,
all of them bad.

22:43.150 --> 22:45.861
But to be fair,
I was busy with medical school.

22:45.861 --> 22:48.759
- Hmm. - Do you have any kids?
- No.

22:51.289 --> 22:52.716
Sorry.

22:53.287 --> 22:55.277
That was a little harsh,
wasn't it?

22:55.277 --> 22:57.919
No, it's an emotional area.

22:58.614 --> 23:00.926
Sure you understand that
more than most people.

23:02.105 --> 23:03.819
I had a miscarriage.

23:06.909 --> 23:09.972
Which made me drop out
of school for a while.

23:11.831 --> 23:14.077
And then,
the doctors told me...

23:14.788 --> 23:18.102
That it was too dangerous
for me to have a baby.

23:19.758 --> 23:24.090
So, I froze my eggs,
just in case... one day.

23:28.492 --> 23:31.655
And now you help other
people have babies.

23:31.655 --> 23:33.071
Mhmm.

23:34.403 --> 23:36.104
It's really amazing.

23:40.101 --> 23:41.386
Ahmm...

23:41.688 --> 23:44.565
I have an appointment,
I gotta go.

23:45.525 --> 23:49.289
Well, please,
watch those moods, all right?

23:53.288 --> 23:56.283
- It was really nice running into you.
- You too. - Bye.

24:05.958 --> 24:09.567
You got that baby finger out?
That's what we talked about!

24:09.926 --> 24:12.521
- Oh, I am...
- Here's the ball... OK.

24:12.617 --> 24:14.661
That arm straight.
Then, you just get up.

24:14.661 --> 24:17.848
You're gonna fall into that ball.
Remember what we talked about?

24:17.873 --> 24:21.855
Just falling, I could just keep falling
and falling, Nate. Here I go.

24:21.855 --> 24:24.172
That's not covered by group lessons.

24:24.172 --> 24:27.455
There you go! That's a mean shot!
Are you kidding me?

24:27.455 --> 24:29.586
- It was fantastic!
- Thank you. - Well done!

24:29.586 --> 24:33.323
- Yeah, absolutely. - Was it really that
good? - Was I good? It was fantastic.

24:33.323 --> 24:35.324
We're done now. That's it for
the group, lads and ladies.

24:35.324 --> 24:36.983
Thank you so much... everyone.

24:37.010 --> 24:40.476
And remember, if you sign for ten individual
lessons, the eleventh one's free.

24:40.476 --> 24:43.271
- Yeah, OK, see you.
- Now we're done.

24:43.271 --> 24:46.358
- Thank you.
- Absolutely. Good job.

24:46.358 --> 24:49.407
You know where you're going, right?
OK.

24:49.867 --> 24:51.159
Tell your friends, Glenda!

24:51.159 --> 24:54.515
[MRS. JOHNSON, YOU HAVE A PHONE
CALL TO TAKE AT THE PRO-SHOP]

24:59.018 --> 25:01.239
Hey, hey,
hey, whoa!

25:10.313 --> 25:11.692
Doctor Hartlin?

25:12.596 --> 25:13.706
Hey!

25:14.082 --> 25:15.543
How can I help?

25:15.699 --> 25:17.152
You give lesson?

25:17.152 --> 25:19.310
Ah, yeah, yeah, I do.

25:19.310 --> 25:21.793
People usually just call and make
an appointment first, though.

25:21.793 --> 25:25.375
Oh, I just thought I'd stop by
and take my chance.

25:25.766 --> 25:29.293
Are you sure you need lessons? That was a
hell of shot that you gave me back there.

25:30.254 --> 25:31.753
Beginner's luck.

25:31.753 --> 25:33.795
Is this a bad time?
Are you mad at me?

25:33.795 --> 25:37.712
No, no, no... I'll tell you, your billing
department sure knows how to hit a guy, though...

25:37.712 --> 25:42.716
Well, look at it as an opportunity for
you to make some of your money back.

25:55.983 --> 25:57.056
Whoa!

25:57.978 --> 26:01.146
It's not bad. You might wanna
slow that swing down a little.

26:01.146 --> 26:02.773
You play much or...?

26:02.773 --> 26:04.248
I used to.

26:04.940 --> 26:06.615
I had to give it up.

26:07.294 --> 26:09.248
Too busy with medical school?

26:10.254 --> 26:11.501
Yeah.

26:12.001 --> 26:14.070
Among other things.

26:15.496 --> 26:18.546
- Ooop!
- There you go! - Yikes!

26:18.844 --> 26:21.254
Looks like I'm gonna
need a lot more lessons.

26:21.254 --> 26:23.869
Well, we can definitely
help you out with that.

26:23.869 --> 26:27.744
Just stop by the Pro-Shop
before you and they'll help you out.

26:28.222 --> 26:31.283
That's my daughter there. I should go see
what's going on. It was great to see you.

26:31.283 --> 26:33.161
Nice to see you!

26:42.639 --> 26:46.158
What's going on? What are you doing here?
I thought you worked for Layla now.

26:46.158 --> 26:48.734
I was wondering if you
could loan me 40 bucks.

26:50.013 --> 26:52.456
Like I said, thought you
worked for Layla now.

26:52.456 --> 26:54.897
Come on, Dad.
It's just a loan.

26:59.026 --> 27:01.710
Isn't that your fertility doctor?
What's she doing here?

27:01.710 --> 27:04.774
She's taking a lesson. I got 20
bucks, that's all I got on me, OK?

27:04.774 --> 27:07.862
Dad? Don't screw up
like you did with Mom.

27:08.441 --> 27:11.088
I'm not going to screw anything up, OK?

27:11.181 --> 27:14.533
I love Layla very much and
I would never do anything to hurt her.

27:15.999 --> 27:17.459
You don't want the money?

27:17.654 --> 27:19.167
Yeah, I want it.

27:19.252 --> 27:22.168
I'm just saying,
Layla is a cool lady.

27:22.348 --> 27:24.408
Yeah, I figured that
out a long time ago.

27:25.551 --> 27:27.708
You got your money,
go on, back to work!

27:35.173 --> 27:38.384
Now, this is the playback
of the embryo transfer.

27:38.833 --> 27:42.184
The catheter tip comes
into the uterine cavity,

27:42.184 --> 27:43.742
from the cervix...

27:43.742 --> 27:47.446
We advanced the catheter tip,
just past the middle of the cavity,

27:47.446 --> 27:50.942
then pulled back slightly
and pushed the plunger.

27:51.574 --> 27:54.668
And there they are,
the embryos coming from the tip.

27:55.075 --> 27:56.571
Oh, my Gosh!

27:56.980 --> 27:58.310
That's amazing.

27:59.942 --> 28:01.432
All right.

28:01.432 --> 28:02.972
Now, remember, Layla.

28:03.495 --> 28:06.445
Take it easy for at least
the next 24 hours.

28:06.671 --> 28:08.626
I've implanted the embryos,

28:08.626 --> 28:11.311
but there is no guarantee that
your body will accept them.

28:11.311 --> 28:12.737
so, technically,

28:12.737 --> 28:14.589
we don't know yet
if you're pregnant.

28:14.659 --> 28:16.935
No, I'm not suggesting
to do a bed rest...

28:16.935 --> 28:19.245
but, ahm, take it easy.

28:19.362 --> 28:20.764
Don't move around too much.

28:20.764 --> 28:23.724
Good time to watch some television,
read a book, all right?

28:23.724 --> 28:27.339
So, how do we know when
she's actually pregnant?

28:27.339 --> 28:29.882
It should begin to implant
the next day or two, right?

28:29.882 --> 28:31.787
- Mhmm.
- That fast?

28:32.938 --> 28:34.658
You've any other questions for me?

28:34.806 --> 28:39.078
- Ahm, I don't have any.
- No, I don't think so, erm...

28:39.304 --> 28:42.715
Thank you so much and look forward
to seeing you again very soon.

28:42.832 --> 28:45.220
Yes, very soon.

28:48.161 --> 28:49.933
- Ahhh!
- Ha, ha, ha!

29:16.115 --> 29:17.229
Shannon?

29:18.348 --> 29:20.594
Layla! Oh, my Gosh!
Thanks for coming.

29:20.640 --> 29:23.254
Guys, can you take a break?
I have a business meeting.

29:30.020 --> 29:32.473
Wow, this is such a
beautiful house, Shannon.

29:32.628 --> 29:35.306
Yeah, I don't live here,
it's just for the show.

29:35.534 --> 29:39.923
- So white! My Goodness.
- Yeah!

29:41.680 --> 29:44.313
So, these stairs make
you feel dizzy or what?

29:44.398 --> 29:46.160
Yeah, you get used to it.

29:46.454 --> 29:50.346
This isn't gonna be filmed, right?
Because I didn't sign a consent for that.

29:50.708 --> 29:54.285
Yeah, you did.
It's on the contract that you signed.

29:54.735 --> 29:59.684
- Oh! - Ahm, I'm not an idiot,
even if I play one on TV.

30:00.043 --> 30:02.284
I'm not gonna show anything
that's gonna hurt my brand.

30:02.284 --> 30:06.105
I know, I know, I didn't mean to say
that you're an idiot, I just...

30:06.105 --> 30:08.442
Yeah... no, I know, erm...

30:08.606 --> 30:11.770
I'm just a little sensitive
about how I'm perceived. Sorry.

30:12.100 --> 30:15.851
Anyway, I wanted to show you my idea
for marketing our new fragrance.

30:15.968 --> 30:18.189
- Oh!
- What if we called it...?

30:19.677 --> 30:21.316
Scorched.

30:23.195 --> 30:26.044
- That is fantastic!
- Yeah?

30:26.247 --> 30:28.693
Yes!
I love the concept.

30:28.693 --> 30:30.958
It would be the perfume that
made you hotter and hotter.

30:30.958 --> 30:35.130
That bit, "Scorched", it kind of sounds
like something's burnt, you know?

30:35.924 --> 30:37.507
How about?

30:38.021 --> 30:39.497
"Sizzle".

30:39.522 --> 30:40.522
Hmm.

30:40.912 --> 30:42.127
Sizzle?

30:42.771 --> 30:44.005
Sizzle.

30:44.219 --> 30:45.778
- I like it!
- Yeah?

30:45.803 --> 30:47.576
You know what?
I'll have my trade-mark attorneys...

30:47.576 --> 30:49.731
check to see if it's available,
and...

30:49.731 --> 30:51.814
if not, then we'll look
into buying the rights.

30:51.814 --> 30:54.472
- That's hot!
- I think so too.

30:54.504 --> 30:55.504
So...

30:55.684 --> 30:59.533
Oh, Layla, I'm sorry, I have to get
back to my "work-out routine"...

30:59.533 --> 31:01.706
- Hi! - But have a think
and we'll talk later...

31:01.706 --> 31:06.103
and I'm so, so blessed to be working
with such a creative person.

31:11.523 --> 31:13.234
Scorched?

31:20.378 --> 31:22.894
- Hey, babe?
- What's up, hon?

31:23.049 --> 31:24.687
I need your help with this.

31:26.694 --> 31:29.744
Wow! Jeez, you're taking a lot of those.

31:29.769 --> 31:32.884
Between the ones doctor Hartlin is
giving you and the ones I'm giving you,

31:32.884 --> 31:35.115
you're turning into a greater porcupine.

31:36.297 --> 31:38.795
All right, you know what?
I'm gonna do it myself. Forget it.

31:38.795 --> 31:40.355
- No, wait, Layla! - What?

31:40.355 --> 31:42.763
I need your help and you're calling
me names, making fun of me!

31:42.763 --> 31:44.590
- No, I'm not!
- Yes, you are!

31:44.590 --> 31:48.262
I'll do it, OK? Calm down, you're flying
off the handle for no reason here.

31:49.185 --> 31:50.582
You're OK?

31:52.825 --> 31:54.114
Sorry.

31:54.114 --> 31:55.616
Just a little...

31:56.613 --> 31:57.938
Crazy.

31:58.965 --> 32:00.455
I don't know what's wrong.

32:01.726 --> 32:03.222
Well...

32:05.009 --> 32:06.066
It's OK.

32:08.947 --> 32:10.525
- Hey.
- Hmm?

32:10.550 --> 32:11.981
You don't have to take
the shot right now.

32:11.981 --> 32:15.244
Yes, I have to have it right now.
I wanna have this baby.

32:15.244 --> 32:16.841
- OK.
- I need you to give me this shot.

32:16.841 --> 32:18.801
That's not my point,
I'll give you the shot.

32:22.029 --> 32:23.183
OK?

32:31.283 --> 32:33.215
- You're ready?
- Yeah.

32:41.183 --> 32:42.305
There you go.

32:42.412 --> 32:44.015
Thank you.

32:51.290 --> 32:52.710
OK, hon, I'm off.

34:00.254 --> 34:03.023
Ah, hi!
What are you doing here?

34:04.997 --> 34:06.908
Where was this picture taken?

34:08.072 --> 34:10.389
Somewhere in Florida, I think,
I'm not sure.

34:10.605 --> 34:12.456
Is that where you blew out your knee?

34:12.581 --> 34:15.259
Ah, no, that was, ah...

34:15.259 --> 34:18.291
in the Pro-Shop parking
lot in San Antonio.

34:19.516 --> 34:22.828
- Did you slip?
. No, I was...

34:23.359 --> 34:27.101
Drinking with some buddies and playing
"Fast and the Furious" in a golf kart.

34:27.101 --> 34:29.880
I love it til the first five.

34:29.880 --> 34:32.001
After that, it became too commercial.

34:33.752 --> 34:35.187
So, what happened to you?

34:35.409 --> 34:36.550
I...

34:36.906 --> 34:38.703
Jumped out of a moving golf kart...

34:38.877 --> 34:42.897
into another golf kart and missed and
landed on my knee amongst other things.

34:43.242 --> 34:46.801
Ouch! You know, that's why
Vin Diesel uses stuntmen.

34:46.860 --> 34:49.299
I don't know what going
on here, do you...?

34:49.324 --> 34:51.330
Do you really want
lessons or...?

34:51.820 --> 34:54.456
Yes, I do.

34:54.672 --> 34:56.938
But what I want right now...

34:57.736 --> 34:59.210
is tequila.

35:01.099 --> 35:02.649
Are you sure you don't want one?

35:02.828 --> 35:03.818
No?

35:04.146 --> 35:06.152
All right, OK, yeah, sure.

35:06.710 --> 35:08.548
I'll have one and then I gotta...

35:09.297 --> 35:10.885
<i>- Salud.
- Salud.</i>

35:15.574 --> 35:17.215
Whooooo!

35:17.363 --> 35:19.707
- It's good, huh?
- It's very good, actually.

35:20.183 --> 35:22.907
Look, I gotta clean up
and get going, erm...

35:26.861 --> 35:29.865
- Where was this one taken?
- I have no idea.

35:31.303 --> 35:32.759
That's my Dad.

35:36.826 --> 35:37.952
I'm sorry?

35:43.358 --> 35:44.567
That's your Dad?

35:44.567 --> 35:45.761
Mhmm.

35:47.345 --> 35:49.749
No! Sissy?

35:52.201 --> 35:53.505
Sissy?

35:53.505 --> 35:56.842
I was wondering when you
were going to recognize me.

35:56.842 --> 36:00.984
- I mean...
- Oh, my God, you're not Sissy Dolin!

36:00.984 --> 36:02.086
What?

36:02.651 --> 36:06.797
- Wow! You look so different. I didn't
recognize you. - It's 20 years later.

36:07.040 --> 36:10.287
And I had a pretty bad car accident.

36:10.287 --> 36:11.974
Broke my nose,
my jaw.

36:12.254 --> 36:16.324
So I had the plastic surgeons put
me back together just prettier.

36:16.782 --> 36:19.656
Wee, you were put good together pretty
good back then, I gotta say... I...

36:19.681 --> 36:22.162
- Oh, my God.
- Thank you.

36:22.202 --> 36:23.574
Sissy!

36:23.759 --> 36:26.535
- I don't remember breaking up with you.
- That's because you never did!

36:26.535 --> 36:28.714
You just stopped returning my calls.

36:28.784 --> 36:31.082
I must have been some kind of idiot,
I don't know.

36:31.531 --> 36:33.619
Ah! I won't argue that.

36:35.045 --> 36:38.192
Sissy Dolin, holy smokes!

36:40.296 --> 36:43.310
Whooo! Let's celebrate,
like the old times.

36:43.310 --> 36:44.755
All right.

36:46.957 --> 36:49.997
Oh, oh, my Gosh.

36:52.190 --> 36:53.965
What was in that drink?

36:54.058 --> 36:56.008
You're such a light-weight now.

36:56.008 --> 36:58.548
No, I'm serious, what was...?

36:58.710 --> 37:00.374
What was in that...?

37:02.241 --> 37:03.604
What was that?

37:03.629 --> 37:05.859
Something to make you feel good.

37:08.951 --> 37:11.721
- Like in the good old days.
- Whoa, whoa...

37:11.882 --> 37:15.519
Whoa, whoa... I c...
Sissy, I can't...

37:16.519 --> 37:18.439
You can.

37:19.231 --> 37:22.044
Oh, my God, you sure smell good.

37:22.069 --> 37:24.553
- See?
- I can't.

37:24.643 --> 37:26.748
No, no, stop.
You have stop.

37:29.437 --> 37:31.170
I love you, Nate.

37:31.263 --> 37:33.010
No, no, no...

37:33.858 --> 37:35.692
All right, stop.

37:35.692 --> 37:37.431
Hmmmm.

37:38.499 --> 37:40.633
Wait, wait, wait...

37:40.732 --> 37:41.757
I can't.

37:42.311 --> 37:45.616
I can't, I can't,
I can't, I can't...

38:31.127 --> 38:32.638
- Nate?
- Shhh!

38:32.638 --> 38:34.497
- Are you drunk?
- Shhhh!

38:34.497 --> 38:37.355
Oh, my God!
You reek of booze!

38:37.380 --> 38:38.871
- Look at me, Nate.
- Stop, Layla.

38:38.871 --> 38:40.311
Stop it!

38:41.003 --> 38:43.133
- You are going to be a father.
- Look...

38:43.133 --> 38:45.478
You put... you want Allison
to see you like this? - Shhhh.

38:45.478 --> 38:48.721
- I know... - You promised me you weren't gonna
do this... - What's going on? - He's drunk.

38:48.721 --> 38:51.158
- Seriously, Dad?
- No, you get in the house.

38:51.158 --> 38:53.742
Right now! Will you help me...
take him in there?

38:57.875 --> 38:59.551
Oooh, maybe help me...

38:59.576 --> 39:01.070
get him to the bed.

39:01.179 --> 39:03.739
- Oh, sorry about that.
- Oh, Nate, shut up!

39:03.739 --> 39:05.685
- Go.
- OK.

39:06.146 --> 39:07.492
Help me get him up.

39:07.517 --> 39:10.241
I've never seen him like this. He
promised me he wouldn't drink.

39:10.241 --> 39:11.615
I'm so embarrassed.

39:11.615 --> 39:14.473
Layla, it's gonna be OK.
I know it's not easy.

39:14.473 --> 39:16.470
Look, I've been dealing
with this my whole life.

39:19.030 --> 39:20.993
Well, I appreciate you
being here, I know.

39:20.993 --> 39:23.191
Me coming into your life has been rough.

39:23.191 --> 39:27.008
- It's been weird but not rough.
- What do you mean "weird"?

39:27.313 --> 39:30.879
You're not weird, it's just the whole
"Daddy's new wife" weirdness.

39:30.879 --> 39:33.048
You is a normal weird.

39:33.181 --> 39:35.168
But you're fantastic and...

39:35.300 --> 39:37.354
Dad's lucky to have someone like you.

39:38.266 --> 39:41.325
Well, thanks.
He's lucky to have you too.

39:41.325 --> 39:42.546
All right?

39:42.546 --> 39:46.424
- Will you help me take off his pants?
- No, no, no, I'm not doing that. - OK.

39:46.424 --> 39:48.888
- All right. - Good night.
- Good night.

40:12.985 --> 40:14.234
Aah.

40:17.538 --> 40:19.114
You look like crap.

40:20.233 --> 40:21.448
Thank you.

40:22.201 --> 40:24.468
How much did you drink last night, huh?

40:24.468 --> 40:26.178
I've never seen you like that.

40:26.178 --> 40:27.977
It wasn't the booze.

40:28.874 --> 40:30.070
What does that mean?

40:31.491 --> 40:33.880
It means even when
I was drinking a lot...

40:34.085 --> 40:35.182
I wouldn't...

40:35.257 --> 40:37.795
black out and go on benders and...

40:38.727 --> 40:40.707
It was never, ever like this.

40:44.136 --> 40:45.562
Drink your coffee.

41:08.398 --> 41:09.474
Nate?

41:11.149 --> 41:12.239
Hello?

41:28.908 --> 41:30.461
Doctor Hartlin?

41:31.450 --> 41:32.858
What are you doing here?

41:33.154 --> 41:34.863
I was in the neighborhood.

41:34.957 --> 41:36.507
I thought I'd check in.

41:37.226 --> 41:40.269
I did ring the doorbell
but nobody answered.

41:42.954 --> 41:44.327
I hope it's OK?

41:44.566 --> 41:46.174
I just let myself in.

41:46.234 --> 41:51.518
Oh, yeah, erm, I'm sorry I don't normally
hear the doorbell when I'm upstairs.

41:51.924 --> 41:53.737
It's good to see you.

41:55.413 --> 41:57.743
You wanna come up and look at my office?

41:57.743 --> 41:59.246
Love to!

42:06.863 --> 42:08.078
Wow!

42:08.613 --> 42:09.946
This is amazing.

42:09.971 --> 42:11.646
- Thank you.
- What is it?

42:11.809 --> 42:13.778
This is a perfume organ.

42:13.778 --> 42:16.108
This is the heart and
soul of my business.

42:16.108 --> 42:19.416
I've been assembling it
for 15 years now.

42:19.441 --> 42:23.231
Just gathering up all sorts of
ingredients for my fragrances.

42:23.285 --> 42:25.721
- Never seen anything like it.
- Hmm.

42:25.837 --> 42:27.276
How do you use it?

42:27.962 --> 42:30.213
Erm, well, all right...

42:30.881 --> 42:33.676
So, it's really just a matter
of finding the scents,

42:33.676 --> 42:36.547
which are all separate items and then,

42:36.547 --> 42:38.050
combining them,

42:38.316 --> 42:40.711
to create something new.

42:40.985 --> 42:41.975
All right.

42:43.717 --> 42:44.868
Smell this.

42:48.142 --> 42:49.310
OK.

42:50.038 --> 42:51.038
OK.

42:51.710 --> 42:53.062
Now, try this one.

42:55.982 --> 42:57.845
It sort of smells different.

42:58.345 --> 43:00.544
That's right,
that's because your...

43:00.752 --> 43:03.600
perception of scent changes
by what's around it.

43:04.757 --> 43:06.960
And the scents interact
with each other.

43:07.086 --> 43:09.945
And the amount of interaction
changes over time...

43:12.320 --> 43:15.368
So that sometimes it can
take a month to a year,

43:15.414 --> 43:18.263
for a combination to reach the
scent that you had in mind.

43:19.074 --> 43:21.015
It's like a gestation period.

43:21.725 --> 43:23.999
For a baby,
you know...

43:24.188 --> 43:26.946
Mix the eggs and the
sperm together and...

43:27.113 --> 43:30.637
You really don't know what the results
will be until nine months later.

43:30.792 --> 43:31.808
Huh...

43:32.400 --> 43:33.808
Never thought of that...

43:34.082 --> 43:35.305
that way.

43:37.461 --> 43:40.446
Hey, do you wanna have
a cup of tea with me?

43:42.196 --> 43:43.915
I would love that.

44:15.124 --> 44:16.705
Good morning, father.

44:20.622 --> 44:22.201
What are you doing here?

44:22.965 --> 44:25.746
Making some extra money,
they called me in for a shift.

44:27.119 --> 44:30.179
Here, take my coffee,
you look like you need it.

44:30.386 --> 44:31.489
Thank you.

44:35.003 --> 44:37.045
Hmmm,
ohh!

44:37.045 --> 44:39.979
Allison, how much sugar did you
put in here? It's horrible.

44:40.004 --> 44:42.925
You're welcome!
God, let me take you now.

44:42.925 --> 44:44.831
Just hold on a second,
don't drive yet, OK?

44:44.831 --> 44:47.676
Just give me half a second.

44:48.022 --> 44:49.924
Dad, you gotta be more careful.

44:50.172 --> 44:52.598
- With what?
- With Layla!

44:54.231 --> 44:55.205
What?

44:55.591 --> 44:59.096
You showed up drunk last night and you've
been hanging out with that hot doctor,

44:59.096 --> 45:00.372
I mean, I'm just saying...

45:00.372 --> 45:02.063
This is the kind of stuff
you did with Mom...

45:02.063 --> 45:04.577
Stop, stop, stop, OK?

45:05.227 --> 45:07.136
Are you seriously
lecturing me right now?

45:07.136 --> 45:10.501
Honestly, I'm the father,
you're the daughter, OK?

45:10.501 --> 45:14.007
Yeah, and that's why I'm lecturing you.
I like Layla.

45:14.007 --> 45:15.472
So do I.

45:15.795 --> 45:18.104
And of course,
she stood there for you.

45:18.233 --> 45:20.105
- Oh, God.
- Tell me about it.

45:20.195 --> 45:24.551
- Argh.
- Just don't blow up with her, OK?

45:24.551 --> 45:27.371
'Cos if you do, I want Layla
to get custody of me.

45:27.396 --> 45:30.374
- Thanks for the vote of confidence.
- You're welcome, Dad.

45:32.128 --> 45:33.439
Jesus!

45:35.343 --> 45:37.924
Oooop! Let's go.

45:38.753 --> 45:40.384
- Just keep it on the road.
- Yeah, I got it!

45:46.885 --> 45:49.323
- Can I help you with that?
- No, no, no, I'm good.

45:50.007 --> 45:52.206
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

45:52.206 --> 45:53.836
Oh, don't!

45:55.695 --> 45:58.163
Another text from Shannon Reid.
Unbelievable.

45:58.163 --> 46:00.080
Shannon Reid, the reality star?

46:00.080 --> 46:04.586
Yes, I'm creating a fragrance for the
company and she texts me all the time.

46:04.586 --> 46:06.370
That can be stressful.

46:06.370 --> 46:09.732
Specially when you have to
keep your stress level down.

46:10.441 --> 46:12.240
That's why the call can wait.

46:15.782 --> 46:17.874
So, do you visit all
your patients at home?

46:18.045 --> 46:19.133
No, I don't.

46:19.133 --> 46:21.429
No, it's just that you feel like,

46:22.009 --> 46:23.009
well...

46:23.298 --> 46:25.686
You and Nate are special to me.

46:26.220 --> 46:27.669
That's so sweet.

46:27.913 --> 46:29.440
So, how is Nate?

46:30.022 --> 46:31.360
Oh, he's good.

46:31.862 --> 46:34.573
A little below stressed out
but that's normal.

46:35.013 --> 46:36.013
Really?

46:36.736 --> 46:39.067
Has he done anything that
you're worried about?

46:39.067 --> 46:40.166
No.

46:40.844 --> 46:42.501
Hm, I don't know,
he's just...

46:42.501 --> 46:45.494
He's just distant and it's probably
my fault because I'm so...

46:46.076 --> 46:49.412
Immersed in this business deal
and the fertility treatment.

46:49.412 --> 46:51.226
Has he been acting like...

46:51.399 --> 46:52.890
I don't know,
there's something wrong?

46:54.720 --> 46:56.805
He came home drunk the other night.

46:57.557 --> 47:01.301
Well, you have been going
through a lot lately, so...

47:01.566 --> 47:03.622
Maybe he just wanted
to blow off a little steam.

47:03.622 --> 47:06.712
Yeah, well, I haven't seen him drink
little that since he left the pro-tour.

47:06.712 --> 47:08.732
Oh, ten years ago?

47:09.102 --> 47:10.575
How do you know about that?

47:13.060 --> 47:14.247
You told me!

47:14.787 --> 47:18.471
- Hmm. - Yeah, you know, one of those
forms you filled out at the office?

47:18.888 --> 47:19.808
Oh!

47:23.208 --> 47:25.632
Do you mind if I excuse
myself and use the restroom?

47:25.632 --> 47:27.292
No, please.

48:10.306 --> 48:11.668
Where are you off to?

48:11.668 --> 48:14.735
Layla forgot to send this out
and she's snapping at me to do it.

48:15.547 --> 48:17.540
I'm sorry about that, OK?
Just...

48:17.540 --> 48:19.955
Please, do me a favor, sweetheart?
Try to be nice to her...

48:19.955 --> 48:22.245
- Yeah. - She's under a lot
of stress, OK? - Yeah!

48:22.346 --> 48:25.534
Yeah, yeah, she's forgetting everything,
messing stuff up, taking it out on me...

48:25.596 --> 48:28.599
And then, she spends the whole morning
talking to that doctor friend of yours.

48:29.812 --> 48:30.857
Doctor Hartlin?

48:30.857 --> 48:32.597
Yeah.
I gotta go, Dad.

48:32.597 --> 48:33.945
Was she here?

48:37.617 --> 48:40.231
Did Allison leave? I have to
talk to you about something.

48:40.704 --> 48:42.183
Yeah, she just...

48:42.261 --> 48:45.188
went down to the Post Office, erm...

48:45.525 --> 48:47.827
- Was doctor Hartlin here?
- Yeah, why?

48:47.827 --> 48:49.898
For no reason, I just didn't
know fertility doctors

48:49.898 --> 48:51.676
made house calls, that's all.

48:52.571 --> 48:55.016
Don't worry, honey, she's
not gonna charge us, OK?

48:55.016 --> 48:57.569
- I didn't say anything about money.
- You didn't have to, babe.

48:57.569 --> 48:59.703
Because, you know, you're
always concerned about money.

48:59.703 --> 49:02.216
Clearly more concerned than you
are about me and this baby.

49:02.216 --> 49:03.828
You know what?
You need to simmer down.

49:03.828 --> 49:05.649
- Simmer down? - Yes!
- Really?

49:05.649 --> 49:09.104
Seriously, yelling at Allison about
stuff that is clearly not her fault?

49:09.104 --> 49:12.520
And that's not fair... You know? You
try to run your own business and...

49:12.520 --> 49:14.933
get pregnant, stick yourself
with hormones every single day,

49:14.933 --> 49:18.039
with a husband who's never home and I'm
doing every single thing by myself...

49:18.039 --> 49:19.751
- All right, stop.
- I asked her to help me three times...

49:19.751 --> 49:22.778
Honey, please, do not tell
me to calm down, I am fine.

49:22.778 --> 49:25.905
Allison, what are you doing, honey? You're
supposed to go down to the Post Office.

49:25.905 --> 49:27.258
I forgot my wallet.

49:27.258 --> 49:29.923
- Wow!
- Go get it then, please.

49:30.989 --> 49:34.891
Layla, I know this is rough but
you're really getting like...

49:35.106 --> 49:37.776
- Like what? Crazy?
- Yeah.

49:37.776 --> 49:41.363
What are you... on crazy drugs?
You're not even pregnant yet.

49:45.103 --> 49:48.345
- I'm sorry, Layla, I didn't mean for
that to be like... - No, no, I'm sorry.

49:48.345 --> 49:50.070
I'm sorry.
OK?

49:50.265 --> 49:52.265
I shouldn't take it out on you.

49:54.398 --> 49:56.542
I just have to talk to doctor Hartlin.

49:57.210 --> 49:59.772
Erm... yeah.
Do you trust her?

50:00.394 --> 50:01.929
What do you mean "trust her"?

50:02.290 --> 50:04.369
I don't know,
there's something about her...

50:04.369 --> 50:06.385
There is something about her?
I don't...

50:06.765 --> 50:08.688
Guess I shouldn't be
trusting my own doctor now.

50:08.688 --> 50:10.967
- No, no, you're right! - There's
a problem with doctor Hartlin...

50:10.967 --> 50:12.973
I gotta get the packages
to the Post Office!

50:12.973 --> 50:14.738
I need some support from the
both of you right now...

50:14.738 --> 50:16.509
Because I'm not getting any!

52:30.154 --> 52:32.563
Hey, Jason,
what's going on?

52:33.603 --> 52:34.533
What?

52:34.558 --> 52:35.858
What text?

52:35.858 --> 52:39.040
Look, I’m just relaying what
Shannon told me you sent her.

52:39.091 --> 52:40.934
Layla, why would you
tell her she's, quote:

52:40.934 --> 52:43.522
"Not how I see my brand".
It was a done deal!

52:43.741 --> 52:47.644
Errr, I don't know what you're talking
about, I didn't send her any text.

52:47.879 --> 52:49.537
I don't know. Why didn't you
tell you have reservations

52:49.537 --> 52:51.412
about working with her
in the first place?

52:51.524 --> 52:53.758
Because I don't,
Jason, I...

52:53.783 --> 52:56.988
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't have any issues with her.

52:57.066 --> 52:59.928
No, well, yeah, I'm not
so sure about that.

53:00.343 --> 53:02.402
This is really gonna
make me look like an idiot.

53:02.752 --> 53:06.516
Look, all I know is that Shannon is
pissed and she's backed out of the deal.

53:06.830 --> 53:07.830
What?

53:08.591 --> 53:10.185
What are you talking about?

53:10.210 --> 53:13.734
Listen, Shannon is a professional and she
doesn't have time to be dealing with this

53:13.734 --> 53:16.860
childish crap, so,
I'm sorry, it's a no-go.

53:17.018 --> 53:21.396
Well, she can't pull out, because we have
a contract, Jason, and I can sue her.

53:21.479 --> 53:26.206
Oh, you can sue but it's not gonna
help anybody, specially you!

53:26.408 --> 53:28.540
In fact, it's only gonna hurt
you more than anything else.

53:28.540 --> 53:30.815
I'll bet you don't even
have the money for lawyers.

53:30.815 --> 53:33.543
And what's more, nobody's even
wanna work with you again.

53:34.168 --> 53:35.168
God!

53:35.758 --> 53:36.758
Hello?

53:37.116 --> 53:37.912
He...?

53:39.304 --> 53:40.014
Hey!

53:41.046 --> 53:42.046
Hey, hey...

53:42.057 --> 53:44.168
- Oh, my God!
- What's going on?

53:45.988 --> 53:47.493
Layla, hey, hey!

53:47.783 --> 53:49.855
Talk to me, honey,
what happened?

53:51.232 --> 53:53.298
I lost the contract.

53:54.079 --> 53:56.196
Oh, honey...

53:56.328 --> 53:59.056
I'm sorry, what...?
What happened?

54:00.056 --> 54:03.680
Shannon broke the contract because
someone sent a text from my phone

54:03.680 --> 54:06.013
saying I don't want her
representing my brand.

54:06.013 --> 54:09.465
Someone used your phone?
Who would...? Who would do that?

54:12.151 --> 54:15.852
- I don't know. This is terrible.
- OK, it's OK.

54:17.267 --> 54:19.696
This thing isn't coming
back anytime soon.

54:19.789 --> 54:23.929
- I don't know how we're gonna afford this
baby if I don't have this contract. - Hey...

54:23.929 --> 54:26.430
- Calm down, OK?
- I need to talk to Shannon.

54:26.430 --> 54:28.993
We're gonna figure this out, OK?
So, you didn't send the text.

54:28.993 --> 54:31.246
- No! I didn't send the text!
- OK!

54:31.246 --> 54:34.109
- OK, so what we do is prove... - It's not working.
- It's OK, stop.

54:34.109 --> 54:37.884
We just prove that you didn't send the texts
and then, they can't break the contract.

54:38.459 --> 54:39.553
Right?

54:40.328 --> 54:41.677
I can't believe this happened.

54:41.677 --> 54:44.284
I'm gonna take the phone in tomorrow.
OK?

54:44.602 --> 54:45.604
I'll get it fixed.

54:45.604 --> 54:48.741
- I'm sorry. - I'll figure it out. Don't worry.
- I'm sorry. - Come here.

54:49.562 --> 54:50.565
Come here.

54:51.883 --> 54:54.250
It's OK.
We'll figure it out, OK?

55:00.485 --> 55:01.459
Where are you going?

55:01.459 --> 55:03.627
I'm gonna straighten
things out with Shannon.

55:03.892 --> 55:07.116
- You shouldn't be driving anywhere.
- Are you telling me what to do now?

55:07.116 --> 55:08.713
I meant I'll take you.

55:08.713 --> 55:12.729
Aw... all right then,
let's go!

55:22.812 --> 55:25.534
Allison, I'm gonna need you
to drive a little faster, OK?

55:25.610 --> 55:28.049
Layla, there's a lot of traffic.

55:29.048 --> 55:33.153
If you don't mind me asking, do you really think
it's a good idea to see Shannon Reid right now?

55:33.153 --> 55:36.124
I have no idea,
but I don't know what else to do.

55:38.033 --> 55:40.659
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
OK, stop!

55:40.659 --> 55:43.172
OK, OK,
I got it, I got it!

55:43.220 --> 55:45.656
Seriously, if you're gonna go see her,
you need to chill out.

55:45.656 --> 55:49.724
She thinks I sent her these text messages
that I don't wanna work with her.

55:49.724 --> 55:52.431
- Well, who else sent them?
- I don't know!

55:53.148 --> 55:55.704
I mean, yeah, sure you're cute but...

55:55.704 --> 55:58.276
all he wanted to do is
talk about himself.

55:58.276 --> 55:59.657
Who needs that?

55:59.657 --> 56:01.366
Shannon, I need to talk
to you for a minute.

56:01.366 --> 56:04.033
Shannon, I'm so sorry, she
said she had an appointment.

56:04.033 --> 56:05.324
This is just gonna take a minute.

56:05.324 --> 56:07.811
Layla, I'm filming my show here.

56:07.811 --> 56:11.071
I never sent those text messages to you,
someone grabbed my phone.

56:11.522 --> 56:13.319
Can we talk about this later?

56:13.319 --> 56:14.801
Do you want me to call security?

56:15.754 --> 56:18.690
I'm gonna have a baby,
I need this contract, OK?

56:18.690 --> 56:20.052
You are too much!

56:21.198 --> 56:23.829
- Oh, oh, oh! She's gonna...
- Shhhhh!

56:23.855 --> 56:25.972
Oh, she's gonna...
she's gonna barf on me.

56:25.997 --> 56:28.619
Oh, my God, get her off.
She's gonna puke on me, you guys?

56:28.619 --> 56:30.147
Layla!

56:33.811 --> 56:35.327
I'm so sorry.

56:35.352 --> 56:36.534
Layla.

56:38.366 --> 56:39.704
Layla?

56:43.027 --> 56:44.237
Layla?

56:45.999 --> 56:47.999
- Hmm?
- Layla?

56:48.844 --> 56:49.773
Hmmm.

56:49.798 --> 56:51.400
Hey.

56:54.600 --> 56:55.928
Hi!

56:59.449 --> 57:00.558
Where am I?

57:00.583 --> 57:02.816
You're in the hospital, honey.

57:03.462 --> 57:05.451
- Why?
- You fainted.

57:06.502 --> 57:08.260
I fainted?
- Yeah.

57:08.485 --> 57:10.845
Hello, Miss Talbot, I'm doctor Pearson.

57:10.899 --> 57:12.436
How are you feeling?

57:13.670 --> 57:15.074
Confused.

57:15.131 --> 57:16.696
I'm not surprised.

57:16.766 --> 57:18.814
You have got to take care of yourself.

57:18.814 --> 57:21.204
Slow down, you may be overdoing it.

57:21.834 --> 57:24.553
All this stress is not
good for your baby.

57:27.574 --> 57:28.799
What?

57:29.456 --> 57:30.565
My baby?

57:30.667 --> 57:31.855
You didn't know?

57:32.612 --> 57:33.818
No!

57:34.167 --> 57:35.441
Do you believe that?

57:35.466 --> 57:37.574
It's always nice to bring good news.

57:37.574 --> 57:39.033
Congratulations.

57:41.623 --> 57:44.077
However, there was one
other thing I noticed.

57:44.077 --> 57:47.899
The level of hormones your doctor has you
on is several times higher than normal.

57:47.899 --> 57:49.168
What does that mean?

57:49.168 --> 57:52.442
Well, at the very least, it makes
you more prone to severe mood swings.

57:52.599 --> 57:54.480
Well, doctor Hartlin said that,

57:54.480 --> 57:56.018
it would make sure the embryo,

57:56.018 --> 57:58.380
the baby would have a better chance.

57:58.494 --> 58:01.608
You might want to consult
with her about the dosage.

58:01.759 --> 58:02.670
OK.

58:05.090 --> 58:07.261
I don't see any reason to keep you here.

58:07.626 --> 58:08.990
Good luck with everything.

58:09.740 --> 58:12.014
- Thank you. - Take it easy.
- Thank you.

58:12.039 --> 58:14.705
- Thank you so much.
- Congratulations.

58:14.865 --> 58:17.842
- Thanks. - Congratulations.
- Appreciate it, thank you.

58:23.664 --> 58:26.202
- We're having a baby!
- Yes, we are!

58:28.857 --> 58:31.135
We did it!
We did it!

58:35.089 --> 58:38.306
We still got a couple of months before 
we have to kick Allison out of that room.

58:38.306 --> 58:40.851
I don't know if we should kick Allison out.

58:40.871 --> 58:43.573
- Where are we gonna put the baby?
- She's so great.

58:43.899 --> 58:46.027
I love having her around.

58:52.920 --> 58:54.001
What's that?

58:54.677 --> 58:56.916
It's a...

58:57.718 --> 58:59.172
Package.

58:59.658 --> 59:00.744
Wow!

59:01.337 --> 59:02.947
- For you.
- Huh.

59:03.369 --> 59:05.733
It's very sweet.
Who's it from?

59:05.733 --> 59:07.346
Let me see.

59:07.589 --> 59:11.264
"To Layla and Nate. 
Congratulations on the baby. Doctor Hartlin".

59:11.894 --> 59:13.950
- How sweet.
- I'll open it.

59:21.198 --> 59:23.068
"I made this for you".

59:23.314 --> 59:24.848
"You didn't have to".

59:27.961 --> 59:31.932
OK, I can put this up now but I'm not
sure how Allison's gonna feel about it.

59:33.517 --> 59:35.220
Should I put it up?

59:35.790 --> 59:38.358
Did you have sex with doctor Hartlin?

59:39.550 --> 59:40.550
What?

59:42.210 --> 59:45.410
I smelled her perfume on your jacket
when you got home drunk that night.

59:45.730 --> 59:47.566
It's a perfume I made for her.

59:47.566 --> 59:50.071
What are you talking about?
No!

59:50.391 --> 59:51.822
You cheated on me.

59:52.805 --> 59:54.148
Didn't you?

59:54.599 --> 59:56.560
No, Layla, I didn't.

59:56.560 --> 59:59.285
Then, why did I smell her 
perfume on your jacket?

59:59.285 --> 01:00:01.930
Because I'm giving her golf lessons, OK?

01:00:01.930 --> 01:00:03.033
What?

01:00:03.095 --> 01:00:06.500
I've been giving her golf lessons.
She came by and asked for lessons, I...

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:10.132
- Golf lessons? -Yes. - Since when?
- She came by the club... - Why didn’t you tell me that?

01:00:10.201 --> 01:00:11.968
Because I didn't want to
make a big deal out of it,

01:00:11.968 --> 01:00:13.753
and I knew you'd overreact
and I didn't want...

01:00:13.753 --> 01:00:15.802
- Did you have sex with her, Nate?
- No!

01:00:15.802 --> 01:00:17.266
Absolutely not!

01:00:17.266 --> 01:00:19.141
How much did you drink that night?

01:00:19.141 --> 01:00:21.967
I... that night?

01:00:21.967 --> 01:00:26.199
I have no idea what happened because...
she drugged me.

01:00:26.917 --> 01:00:28.619
She drugged you now?

01:00:28.619 --> 01:00:30.746
I'm serious!
She put something on my drink.

01:00:30.746 --> 01:00:33.005
- Why would I make that up?
- You are such a liar!

01:00:33.005 --> 01:00:35.433
-I have no recollection at all.
- You know what you're gonna do?

01:00:35.433 --> 01:00:36.745
You're gonna give a call

01:00:36.745 --> 01:00:39.560
and you're gonna tell her we are
never, ever seeing her again.

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:41.481
No problem. I will go to her
office right now and tell her...

01:00:41.481 --> 01:00:44.301
I don't care where you go,
just get the hell out of here.

01:00:47.121 --> 01:00:48.936
Just get out of here.

01:00:50.509 --> 01:00:52.727
And take that thing with you.

01:01:25.918 --> 01:01:27.935
What the hell...?

01:01:44.016 --> 01:01:46.000
What's going on with...?

01:01:47.073 --> 01:01:48.854
Layla, are you all right?

01:01:49.033 --> 01:01:50.923
Where's Dad going?

01:01:52.790 --> 01:01:54.288
To hell.

01:02:40.563 --> 01:02:41.942
Sissy!

01:03:03.083 --> 01:03:04.546
We need to talk.

01:03:04.871 --> 01:03:06.875
Nice to see you too.

01:03:07.976 --> 01:03:11.806
OK, first of all. You are no
longer Layla's doctor. Understood?

01:03:11.806 --> 01:03:13.145
Wow!

01:03:13.363 --> 01:03:16.796
Your break-up technique
has improved over the years.

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:18.575
Break-up?

01:03:19.515 --> 01:03:22.531
- We're not together.
- Really?

01:03:24.312 --> 01:03:26.610
That's not the impression I got.

01:03:27.574 --> 01:03:29.921
OK, listen to me.

01:03:29.921 --> 01:03:34.640
I'm truly sorry for anything I may have
done to you in the past, OK? I really am.

01:03:34.696 --> 01:03:36.359
I'm married now, though.

01:03:36.359 --> 01:03:39.627
- I'm about to be a... - About to
be a Daddy. - Yes, a father, yeah.

01:03:39.959 --> 01:03:41.069
Yeah.

01:03:42.069 --> 01:03:43.539
I know.

01:03:43.608 --> 01:03:45.227
Not without my help.

01:03:47.030 --> 01:03:50.031
What exactly are you
shooting Layla up with?

01:03:50.031 --> 01:03:51.031
Really?

01:03:51.797 --> 01:03:54.333
I don't tell you how to get drunk.

01:03:54.333 --> 01:03:57.063
You don't tell me how to do my job.

01:03:58.148 --> 01:03:59.498
OK.

01:04:00.942 --> 01:04:01.942
Nate.

01:04:04.137 --> 01:04:05.521
I'm sorry.

01:04:06.577 --> 01:04:07.577
Sorry.

01:04:07.882 --> 01:04:09.678
It's just that I'm...

01:04:10.134 --> 01:04:12.350
Really taken back by...

01:04:12.723 --> 01:04:14.895
You breaking up with me.

01:04:15.272 --> 01:04:17.385
- Again.
- What?

01:04:17.649 --> 01:04:20.855
- Nate. - No, no, no.
- I love you.

01:04:21.984 --> 01:04:25.896
- No, you don't. - We're together.
- No, no, you don't.

01:04:25.896 --> 01:04:28.041
We're together.
You're mine.

01:04:28.332 --> 01:04:30.411
And we're gonna have a baby.

01:04:30.706 --> 01:04:33.793
No. Sissy, you're confused, OK?

01:04:34.319 --> 01:04:35.807
I love Layla.

01:04:37.096 --> 01:04:39.250
- You don't mean that.
- Yes, I do.

01:04:39.741 --> 01:04:41.928
Argh!! Argh!

01:04:42.573 --> 01:04:45.349
If I can't have you,
no one can.

01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:47.205
Argh!! Argh!

01:04:48.545 --> 01:04:52.134
- How did that feel? - What was
that? What's the matter with you?

01:04:54.076 --> 01:04:55.076
Oooof!

01:04:56.051 --> 01:04:57.927
Nightie, night, Daddy.

01:05:05.535 --> 01:05:08.338
You're pregnant?
That's fantastic!

01:05:08.679 --> 01:05:11.250
- I think?
- Yeah, it's great.

01:05:13.329 --> 01:05:16.821
Layla, you should probably sit down.
This can't be good for the baby.

01:05:16.821 --> 01:05:19.442
I'll tell what's not good for the
baby: it's a cheating father.

01:05:19.442 --> 01:05:21.611
- D'you know what I mean?
- Dad?

01:05:23.057 --> 01:05:25.134
What in the hell is that smell?

01:05:27.598 --> 01:05:29.648
Layla, it's perfume.
This house always smells

01:05:29.648 --> 01:05:31.361
like perfume because
of your workshop.

01:05:31.411 --> 01:05:32.924
Something's wrong.

01:05:32.924 --> 01:05:34.222
What?

01:05:37.891 --> 01:05:39.044
Ahhh!

01:05:40.311 --> 01:05:41.551
Oh, my God!

01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:44.844
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

01:05:44.844 --> 01:05:47.170
- What the hell..?
- Oh, my God!

01:05:48.121 --> 01:05:49.941
No way!

01:06:11.097 --> 01:06:12.731
Who would do this?

01:06:12.731 --> 01:06:14.818
We should call the cops.

01:06:17.846 --> 01:06:19.461
I just let myself in.

01:06:19.461 --> 01:06:20.889
Wow!

01:06:21.187 --> 01:06:22.927
This is amazing!

01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:26.511
Doctor Hartlin.

01:06:27.193 --> 01:06:28.235
Layla?

01:06:29.722 --> 01:06:32.065
- Why would she do this?
- Because she wants your father

01:06:32.065 --> 01:06:33.410
and he's on his way to see her.

01:06:33.410 --> 01:06:35.800
- Let me come with you.
- You're not coming with me.

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:38.585
- Layla! - Honey, you're not coming with
me because I don't want you getting hurt.

01:06:38.585 --> 01:06:40.883
You just told me you're pregnant.
You need my help.

01:06:40.883 --> 01:06:42.843
Fine.
Let's go.

01:07:25.290 --> 01:07:26.707
I need your phone.

01:07:26.707 --> 01:07:28.403
I gotta call Nate.

01:07:32.732 --> 01:07:34.493
Baby, pick up, pick up.

01:07:35.963 --> 01:07:37.624
He's not answering.

01:07:39.885 --> 01:07:41.533
Come on, Nate!

01:07:46.668 --> 01:07:48.736
Good morning, sunshine.

01:07:51.413 --> 01:07:52.854
Sissy.

01:07:53.937 --> 01:07:56.191
Sissy, what the hell is this?

01:07:56.216 --> 01:07:58.617
I'm going to tell you a story.

01:07:59.661 --> 01:08:03.141
See, the story is about a young girl...

01:08:03.863 --> 01:08:07.354
Who fell in love with this
handsome, young golfer.

01:08:08.616 --> 01:08:10.897
Only she was... just really...

01:08:11.989 --> 01:08:13.716
She's really stupid.

01:08:15.594 --> 01:08:18.313
- I'm sorry, I don't...
- I'm talking!

01:08:18.673 --> 01:08:19.886
OK.

01:08:22.283 --> 01:08:24.587
She thought it was real love.

01:08:29.849 --> 01:08:31.227
Oh!

01:08:31.319 --> 01:08:33.600
To be so young.

01:08:34.073 --> 01:08:38.118
And so perfectly naive.

01:08:41.805 --> 01:08:44.542
She was blinded by her love.

01:08:45.669 --> 01:08:50.049
For this handsome, young man.

01:08:56.682 --> 01:08:59.874
She was so incredibly happy.

01:09:25.022 --> 01:09:28.792
But she had no idea how fast
that happiness could end.

01:09:39.002 --> 01:09:42.390
And that it would never come back.

01:09:50.246 --> 01:09:52.023
She was pregnant.

01:09:54.610 --> 01:09:57.119
And she tried to get 
ahold of the father.

01:09:58.110 --> 01:09:59.843
She called him.

01:10:00.429 --> 01:10:01.655
Wrote him.

01:10:03.622 --> 01:10:06.337
But she never heard a word from him.

01:10:09.572 --> 01:10:10.757
So...

01:10:10.984 --> 01:10:12.545
One night...

01:10:13.681 --> 01:10:15.657
She got really drunk.

01:10:18.233 --> 01:10:19.316
Really...

01:10:19.710 --> 01:10:21.266
Really drunk.

01:10:21.266 --> 01:10:24.634
She wanted to kill herself.

01:10:32.568 --> 01:10:34.446
But see, she didn't die.

01:10:36.076 --> 01:10:38.293
But she lost her baby.

01:10:38.812 --> 01:10:42.137
And any chance to ever have another one.

01:10:42.536 --> 01:10:44.361
Sissy, I'm sorry.

01:10:44.361 --> 01:10:47.763
I loved you.

01:10:49.403 --> 01:10:51.465
And you just used me.

01:10:52.864 --> 01:10:57.419
- And threw me away.
- No, I didn't, really.

01:10:57.444 --> 01:10:59.383
We were just having fun.

01:10:59.385 --> 01:11:04.316
I loved you like an idiot.

01:11:05.433 --> 01:11:07.719
I thought you loved me too.

01:11:07.719 --> 01:11:09.788
I'm so sorry.

01:11:09.788 --> 01:11:11.923
I'm sorry, OK?

01:11:12.171 --> 01:11:13.846
Good.

01:11:14.713 --> 01:11:20.187
Because you're gonna be
really, really sorry. OK? OK?

01:11:35.847 --> 01:11:38.616
Sissy, Sissy!

01:11:38.719 --> 01:11:42.326
Sissy, let me go, OK? Please?

01:11:43.027 --> 01:11:44.965
Sissy, look at me, please.

01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:51.909
- What is that?
- This isn't going to kill you.

01:11:52.335 --> 01:11:56.539
I won't even knock you out.
It's just going to relax you a bit.

01:11:56.514 --> 01:11:57.878
Don't!

01:11:58.376 --> 01:12:00.764
Don't, don't, please! 
Don't!

01:12:10.412 --> 01:12:12.798
Looks like we have company.

01:12:16.112 --> 01:12:17.296
Nate?

01:12:17.608 --> 01:12:18.768
Come on!

01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:21.634
Nate?

01:12:22.137 --> 01:12:23.710
Where are you?

01:12:26.971 --> 01:12:28.225
Doctor Hartlin?

01:12:32.797 --> 01:12:34.012
Nate?

01:12:44.235 --> 01:12:45.697
Oh, my God!

01:12:48.341 --> 01:12:49.878
What the hell...?

01:12:50.073 --> 01:12:51.850
What's she doing?

01:13:03.512 --> 01:13:04.998
Nate?

01:13:08.771 --> 01:13:10.162
Layla!

01:13:10.564 --> 01:13:12.448
Layla, I'm locked in!

01:13:15.017 --> 01:13:17.291
Nate! Nate!

01:13:17.291 --> 01:13:19.858
Baby, baby, 
are you all right?

01:13:19.872 --> 01:13:22.890
- Hey, I'm gonna get you out of here,
all right? - You're not going anywhere.

01:13:24.575 --> 01:13:27.962
- Stay away from my husband.
- Your faithful husband...?

01:13:27.962 --> 01:13:31.141
- Who slept with me?
- You drugged him.

01:13:31.141 --> 01:13:32.759
Just like you drugged me.

01:13:32.759 --> 01:13:35.201
- We're leaving.
- Not with my baby, you're not.

01:13:35.201 --> 01:13:36.792
What did you say?

01:13:36.917 --> 01:13:38.893
You're just a host.

01:13:39.651 --> 01:13:41.504
I tossed your eggs.

01:13:41.504 --> 01:13:43.714
Nate's sperm, my eggs.

01:13:44.055 --> 01:13:45.316
My baby.

01:13:45.341 --> 01:13:47.538
- You are crazy.
- Hmm.

01:13:48.624 --> 01:13:51.278
Yeah... I used to be.

01:13:51.586 --> 01:13:53.610
Thanks to your husband.

01:13:54.554 --> 01:13:57.575
When he took advantage of me back then.

01:13:58.435 --> 01:13:59.792
Back when?

01:13:59.792 --> 01:14:03.463
My Dad used to work 
the golf pro-tour as an official.

01:14:04.446 --> 01:14:06.107
I was in college.

01:14:06.246 --> 01:14:07.971
Just in college.

01:14:08.981 --> 01:14:11.361
He was buddy-buddies with my Dad.

01:14:12.231 --> 01:14:16.370
But that didn't stop him from taking
advantage of me, and then just...

01:14:16.766 --> 01:14:18.335
Dumping me.

01:14:18.514 --> 01:14:21.502
- That was a long time ago...
- Yes! It was.

01:14:21.502 --> 01:14:23.543
It was a long time ago.

01:14:25.411 --> 01:14:29.069
It took that long to get
my life back together.

01:14:30.666 --> 01:14:33.791
Until your chart...

01:14:33.791 --> 01:14:36.943
came across my desk.

01:14:37.149 --> 01:14:39.443
What are you talking about?

01:14:39.443 --> 01:14:42.547
And then, I realized it
was the same Nate King,

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:46.270
the same worthless heart-breaking...

01:14:46.270 --> 01:14:49.003
OK, you are going to jail for this.

01:14:49.003 --> 01:14:52.794
I am not going to jail because 
you are not going anywhere.

01:14:52.794 --> 01:14:56.438
Whoa, whoa, whoaaa!

01:15:00.892 --> 01:15:02.108
Come here.

01:15:08.097 --> 01:15:09.925
Let's go.
Let's go.

01:15:30.027 --> 01:15:31.459
Come on, come on,
come on!

01:15:33.001 --> 01:15:34.416
[GOING DOWN]

01:15:34.416 --> 01:15:35.522
That's OK.

01:15:40.652 --> 01:15:41.785
Hey!

01:15:41.785 --> 01:15:43.727
You're gonna be all right, OK?

01:15:43.831 --> 01:15:45.048
I got you.

01:15:45.406 --> 01:15:47.079
[FIRST FLOOR]

01:15:47.079 --> 01:15:48.632
OK, that's OK.

01:15:49.998 --> 01:15:51.061
Here we go.

01:15:51.585 --> 01:15:53.018
Hold on, baby.

01:16:02.447 --> 01:16:04.718
Damn it!
Allison has my keys!

01:16:04.718 --> 01:16:07.576
You have your keys, baby?
You have your keys in here?

01:16:07.735 --> 01:16:09.470
I got them! I got them,
I got them!

01:16:09.846 --> 01:16:11.133
OK.

01:16:16.102 --> 01:16:19.106
-OK, ready? - Yeah.
- Now you can stand up, baby.

01:16:19.106 --> 01:16:20.265
I got you.

01:16:20.491 --> 01:16:21.560
OK.

01:16:25.782 --> 01:16:27.442
Oh, wake up!

01:16:28.284 --> 01:16:29.284
OK!

01:16:29.581 --> 01:16:31.554
Baby, it's gonna be OK, all right?

01:16:34.042 --> 01:16:35.161
Come on!

01:16:35.711 --> 01:16:37.741
Come on, you gotta be kidding me.

01:16:37.831 --> 01:16:39.469
Damned car!

01:16:52.942 --> 01:16:54.008
Aaah!

01:16:57.083 --> 01:16:59.019
What the hell is she doing?

01:17:02.378 --> 01:17:05.675
- Aaah!
- Get out of the damned car!

01:17:05.730 --> 01:17:07.763
Nate, baby, 
please, wake up!

01:17:12.481 --> 01:17:14.457
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:17:14.717 --> 01:17:18.494
You know I wouldn't do that.
I just want my baby.

01:17:18.689 --> 01:17:20.395
It's my baby!

01:17:20.395 --> 01:17:23.626
It's my baby.
It's my baby!

01:17:25.890 --> 01:17:26.910
Aaah!

01:17:32.999 --> 01:17:34.213
Nate!

01:17:43.341 --> 01:17:44.680
Leave him alone!

01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:46.841
If I can't have him,
you can't have him.

01:17:46.841 --> 01:17:48.537
Nate!

01:17:54.337 --> 01:17:58.453
- I want my baby. - Back away or
there's not gonna be any baby!

01:17:58.526 --> 01:18:01.437
- Oh, you wouldn't do that.
- Oh, yeah?

01:18:02.959 --> 01:18:06.323
- Watch me. - No!
- Aaah! - No!

01:18:16.873 --> 01:18:19.136
You're gonna have my baby.

01:18:19.178 --> 01:18:21.175
I'll kill you!

01:18:25.336 --> 01:18:26.499
Dad?

01:18:32.182 --> 01:18:35.113
Please, help us!
My husband is hurt!

01:18:36.164 --> 01:18:40.094
- Please, be OK.
- Oh, my God! Nate...

01:18:49.381 --> 01:18:52.045
Wait, but I thought you put 
the essential oils into the mix last.

01:18:52.045 --> 01:18:55.895
Most of the time, but then sometimes
you kind of go by what you feel.

01:18:56.536 --> 01:18:58.102
Knock, knock...

01:18:58.352 --> 01:19:00.324
- Look who dropped by for a visit.
- Oh!

01:19:00.324 --> 01:19:02.795
Layla, you look fantastic!

01:19:02.795 --> 01:19:04.241
- Jason!
- Hi.

01:19:04.241 --> 01:19:05.964
So good to see you!

01:19:05.964 --> 01:19:09.245
- It's good to see you working again.
- Oh, thanks for the flowers.

01:19:09.292 --> 01:19:12.245
And Allison? Looks like you're
part of the team now, right?

01:19:12.332 --> 01:19:14.886
- I do what I can.
- Good, well...

01:19:14.886 --> 01:19:16.840
- Have a seat! - OK.
- How you been?

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:18.795
I've been good, I've been
good, actually, erm...

01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:22.314
There are things I wanna talk to you about
but I just wanted to ask, I saw the...

01:19:22.529 --> 01:19:25.765
I saw these stories all over the
interweb about the fertility doctor...

01:19:25.765 --> 01:19:28.912
Yeah, you liked those headlines?
"Fetal Attraction"?

01:19:29.336 --> 01:19:32.566
Yeah, well, let's just hope
she's away for a long time.

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:36.328
- And sorry, so, is Nate Junior,
he's...? - He's my son.

01:19:37.222 --> 01:19:39.897
Erm, we did DNA testing and...

01:19:39.897 --> 01:19:42.356
It's my egg that got fertilized, not hers.

01:19:42.381 --> 01:19:44.910
Well, yeah, that must be
a relief then, right?

01:19:45.235 --> 01:19:49.366
- Oh, hey, how is Shannon doing? - Oh,
no, please. - Don't talk about Shannon.

01:19:49.366 --> 01:19:51.774
No, no, she's good, she's good. She
actually wants to work with you.

01:19:51.774 --> 01:19:53.702
- What?
- Well, I...

01:19:53.702 --> 01:19:56.094
I think it's all thanks to the video
of you appearing on her show.

01:19:56.094 --> 01:19:58.120
- Oh, you mean the fight scene.
- Yes!

01:19:58.145 --> 01:20:01.234
- Oh, no!
- No, no, no, listen, listen...

01:20:01.357 --> 01:20:03.192
People are into the
idea of the perfume

01:20:03.192 --> 01:20:05.165
and they wanna see you guys
continue to work together.

01:20:05.190 --> 01:20:07.179
You gotta be kidding me!

01:20:07.204 --> 01:20:08.267
I told you!

01:20:08.267 --> 01:20:12.042
So, people don't just wanna buy
a car or a perfume or whatever.

01:20:12.042 --> 01:20:14.185
They wanna buy the
story behind it.

01:20:14.405 --> 01:20:16.114
And the story of you,

01:20:16.114 --> 01:20:20.060
fighting to create the best
perfume ever, people are into it.

01:20:21.692 --> 01:20:23.773
I gotta admit, Layla,
it sounds very good.

01:20:23.839 --> 01:20:25.514
Hmmm, well...

01:20:25.881 --> 01:20:30.209
I don't think I have the time for that right now,
because I'm busy working with Allison.

01:20:30.234 --> 01:20:31.657
Oh, yeah?
On what?

01:20:31.657 --> 01:20:33.752
Our own line of fragrances.

01:20:34.202 --> 01:20:38.143
It's my idea about women
who need women and...

01:20:38.486 --> 01:20:41.979
love women as much as they
love the men in their lives.

01:20:42.903 --> 01:20:45.121
Hmm. What is it called?

01:20:46.318 --> 01:20:47.726
Motherhood.
