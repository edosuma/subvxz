00:00.336 --> 00:02.761
Okay, so this is what
happened before on Star...

00:02.786 --> 00:04.507
Simone, have you seen your father?

00:06.821 --> 00:09.404
I didn't know you had such
a lovely daughter, Carlotta.

00:09.429 --> 00:11.292
You wouldn't think she
had a daughter at all.

00:11.361 --> 00:14.362
Cotton is a man. He's my baby boy.

00:14.464 --> 00:15.696
I asked if I could trust you.

00:15.806 --> 00:17.277
And I asked if you were sure

00:17.302 --> 00:19.534
you wanted to give me your credit card.

00:19.809 --> 00:21.932
- You a hustler.
- Just like you.

00:21.966 --> 00:24.779
We have a backup. Turns
out she has mad pipes.

00:24.954 --> 00:26.720
No justice, no peace.

00:26.745 --> 00:29.189
- No crooked police.
- This is not what we're about!

00:29.214 --> 00:31.124
No justice, no peace.

00:31.149 --> 00:32.656
- No crooked police.
- You got the wrong guy.

00:32.682 --> 00:34.547
- Step out of the vehicle.
- You can't profile me.

00:34.572 --> 00:36.016
I know my rights.

00:40.562 --> 00:43.044
"Love never gives up,

00:43.749 --> 00:45.786
"never loses faith,

00:46.332 --> 00:47.981
"is always hopeful,

00:48.794 --> 00:51.761
"and endures through
every circumstance."

01:02.740 --> 01:05.701
Alexandra Crane, you're being released.

01:06.678 --> 01:08.253
How are you doing?

01:08.322 --> 01:10.115
How do you think I'm doing?

01:10.857 --> 01:13.451
My partner was out of line last night.

01:14.119 --> 01:15.810
We're not all like that.

01:16.922 --> 01:18.521
Hey, I'm sorry.

01:26.629 --> 01:27.795
Mom?

01:30.206 --> 01:31.643
Look at your face.

01:31.712 --> 01:33.570
Who did this to you?
Who did this to her?!

01:33.639 --> 01:34.904
What are you doing here?

01:34.973 --> 01:37.448
I posted bail. Moses called me.

01:37.473 --> 01:39.143
You could have called me first.

01:39.211 --> 01:40.443
I'm sorry, Alex.

01:40.512 --> 01:42.445
So much for attorney/client privilege.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.237
Not when I'm footing the bill.

01:44.262 --> 01:46.329
I'm gonna take care
of your release papers.

01:46.429 --> 01:47.761
Tell me what happened.

01:47.786 --> 01:49.427
Alexandra, I want to know everything.

01:49.452 --> 01:51.273
I'm fine, Mom.

01:51.298 --> 01:53.390
All I'm worried about
right now is Derek.

01:53.492 --> 01:55.124
I knew that boy was behind this.

01:55.149 --> 01:56.498
We're going home now.

01:56.523 --> 01:57.993
Alex.

01:59.079 --> 02:01.284
I trusted you, Carol.

02:01.309 --> 02:03.384
My name is Carlotta.

02:04.581 --> 02:06.347
I told her this would happen.

02:06.886 --> 02:09.220
Get off her! You've done enough damage.

02:09.252 --> 02:11.338
Hey, ladies, you do realize

02:11.363 --> 02:12.664
- you're in a police station?
- And what?

02:12.706 --> 02:14.909
- You gonna beat me, too?
- I was just leaving.

02:15.558 --> 02:16.988
Derek's getting arraigned.

02:17.057 --> 02:18.361
I'll be at the courthouse.

02:18.386 --> 02:20.370
- I'm going with you.
- Alexandra.

02:20.479 --> 02:23.019
Look at your face. You're all banged up.

02:23.465 --> 02:25.164
I'll talk to you later.

02:25.577 --> 02:27.245

02:47.583 --> 02:49.297
Where y'all going so early?

02:49.322 --> 02:50.926
Did you hear something
about Derek and Alex?

02:50.951 --> 02:52.287
Alexandra just got out,

02:52.312 --> 02:54.237
and we're about to meet
her at Derek's arraignment.

02:54.262 --> 02:56.279
Let me get changed and go with
you. Why didn't you tell me?

02:56.304 --> 02:58.935
Girl, why would she
want to see you, Star?

02:59.663 --> 03:01.608
I don't know, 'cause we
sleep in the same damn bed...

03:01.633 --> 03:03.163
- why wouldn't she?
- Because you didn't show up

03:03.188 --> 03:04.288
for the rally, Star.

03:04.313 --> 03:05.500
It's starting to get really boring.

03:05.525 --> 03:07.897
Simone, that wasn't my fault.

03:10.210 --> 03:11.382
Whatever.

03:11.414 --> 03:13.780
You and Alex are
sisters, right, with Eva?

03:13.805 --> 03:15.830
Okay, we didn't have any
choice but to use Eva,

03:15.854 --> 03:18.077
and I don't understand why you're
so threatened by her anyway.

03:18.132 --> 03:19.155
I'm not threatened.

03:19.180 --> 03:20.620
You should know better
than that, Simone.

03:20.645 --> 03:22.288
She has nothing on me.

03:26.220 --> 03:27.680
Simone,

03:27.705 --> 03:30.127
are you being serious right now?

03:31.188 --> 03:33.275
Hey, sorry, excuse me.

03:33.300 --> 03:35.104
Hey, y'all, what's up?

03:35.238 --> 03:36.542
Hey.

03:38.652 --> 03:40.706
- Alex, what the hell?
- It's fine.

03:40.731 --> 03:42.131
Girl, you in jail?

03:42.156 --> 03:44.729
- I ain't even been there yet.
- Shut up, Cotton.

03:45.870 --> 03:47.267
All rise.

03:47.292 --> 03:49.167
The Honorable Judge Diaz presiding.

03:49.192 --> 03:51.934
Now hearing Derek Jones
v. The State of Georgia.

03:51.959 --> 03:53.492
Please be seated.

04:08.565 --> 04:10.482
Mr. Jones, you're being charged

04:10.551 --> 04:12.551
with one count of inciting a riot,

04:12.653 --> 04:14.052
one count of resisting arrest,

04:14.077 --> 04:15.777
and one count of aggravated assault

04:15.802 --> 04:17.635
involving a police officer.

04:17.825 --> 04:19.458
How do you want to plead?

04:19.704 --> 04:21.137
Not guilty.

04:21.262 --> 04:25.246
Given you have no priors, I'm
setting the bail at $250,000.

04:25.784 --> 04:28.776
Your legal counsel will go
over bail bond procedures

04:28.801 --> 04:30.869
if you choose to exercise that option.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.104
Trial date to be set
at the next hearing.

04:32.172 --> 04:33.905
No, no, he didn't do it.

04:38.362 --> 04:40.196
- Order. Order. Order!
- Sit down. Sit down!

04:40.280 --> 04:42.013
- Sit down.
- No, this isn't fair.

04:44.184 --> 04:45.426
Order!

04:50.426 --> 04:52.057
- Hello.
- Yo, what up, baby? It's Conny.

04:52.082 --> 04:53.358
Hey, brother, what's going on?

04:53.427 --> 04:55.387
I was talking on the phone with
a friend of mine who says that...

04:55.412 --> 04:58.487
your girls are in this Atlanta
NextFest competition that he's judging.

04:58.512 --> 05:00.018
Yeah, yeah, that-that's right.

05:00.043 --> 05:02.200
Just checked out the video
y'all got on the Web site.

05:02.269 --> 05:03.668
You didn't tell me you
got rid of that blonde

05:03.704 --> 05:05.618
and put this Latina hottie in, though.

05:06.985 --> 05:09.407
No, no, uh, I didn't.

05:09.476 --> 05:12.827
Wait, you said a video on
the Atlanta NextFest Web site?

05:12.852 --> 05:13.912
Yeah.

05:13.981 --> 05:16.481
Hold on, let me check it out.

05:21.188 --> 05:22.944
♪ Make me wanna holler ♪

05:22.969 --> 05:25.061
♪ The way they do my
life I wanna holler ♪

05:25.086 --> 05:26.992
Damn, it's a hit.

05:27.094 --> 05:29.422
I'll tell you what, man,
that new girl is fire.

05:29.500 --> 05:32.375
Put that little mami
in, then we in business.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.826
I want in on this, Jahil.

05:33.851 --> 05:36.038
Listen, I like where
you're going with this, man.

05:36.063 --> 05:38.148
Thanks for looking out.
I appreciate it, brother.

05:38.188 --> 05:40.140
Why don't we try to set a
meeting, we can discuss it?

05:40.165 --> 05:41.632
Yeah, as long as you
give me what I want.

05:42.688 --> 05:43.883
Same old Conny.

05:43.927 --> 05:45.468
I'll get back to you, brother.

05:49.155 --> 05:50.355
Buddy of mine.

05:50.646 --> 05:53.115
He's in tight with one of the
judges from the Atlanta NextFest.

05:53.140 --> 05:54.951
He said somebody uploaded
a video of you singing

05:54.976 --> 05:56.459
with the girls at the rally,

05:56.484 --> 05:58.473
told me that if I needed an edge, maybe,

05:58.498 --> 06:00.108
that you might be the ticket.

06:00.133 --> 06:01.365
- Mm.
- You know, the whole...

06:01.390 --> 06:03.391
Latin angle thing, ¿tú sabe?

06:03.841 --> 06:06.625
Mm. Who would have ever thought of it?

06:06.650 --> 06:08.450
You know, you might be right.

06:08.552 --> 06:10.585
And we could tap into
a whole new demographic.

06:10.654 --> 06:12.520
That Latin market is huge.

06:12.724 --> 06:14.656
And adding a fourth voice to the group

06:14.725 --> 06:16.559
could be just the thing we need.

06:21.999 --> 06:23.798
I'm gonna add you to the group.

06:24.012 --> 06:25.400
Star's not gonna like that.

06:25.425 --> 06:27.692
She better suck it up.

06:37.969 --> 06:39.547
I heard about Derek.

06:39.899 --> 06:41.716
I still can't believe it.

06:41.785 --> 06:45.186
$250K, and he's innocent.

06:45.211 --> 06:46.655
That sound about right.

06:46.680 --> 06:49.368
You know, to be so
educated, you sure is stupid.

06:50.681 --> 06:52.327
Ten percent, dumb-ass.

06:52.396 --> 06:54.296
Ten percent go to the bail bondsman.

06:56.008 --> 06:57.207
Alex.

06:57.705 --> 06:59.853
- I'm okay.
- Where's Derek?

07:00.549 --> 07:01.903
Yo, we got to get him out of there.

07:01.928 --> 07:04.483
- This is crazy.
- Yeah, that's gonna be hard.

07:04.508 --> 07:06.789
Ain't nobody got $25,000 laying around.

07:06.814 --> 07:07.909
Yo, I got it.

07:07.978 --> 07:10.127
We could do a block party fund-raiser.

07:10.596 --> 07:11.680
We could perform.

07:11.705 --> 07:12.986
You know what? You're right, Star.

07:13.011 --> 07:14.369
We can raise this bail bond money

07:14.394 --> 07:16.254
by charging some sort of
entry fee or something.

07:16.279 --> 07:17.424
I'll fry some chicken.

07:17.449 --> 07:19.385
I might be able to get them
old nosy neighbors of yours

07:19.410 --> 07:21.080
to get off they sorry
asses and do something.

07:23.160 --> 07:26.194
Okay, so what song are
we thinking of doing?

07:26.263 --> 07:27.829
I really wanted to be there.

07:28.039 --> 07:29.765
Last night at the rally, I really did.

07:29.790 --> 07:32.457
I was going through something.

07:32.616 --> 07:34.304
What were you going through?

07:38.084 --> 07:41.676
Alexandra, I'd like to
speak to you in private.

07:41.775 --> 07:44.175
Oh, my God, she's back.

07:45.193 --> 07:47.022
He's in there right now,

07:48.054 --> 07:49.451
and I don't know what to do.

07:49.553 --> 07:50.885
I'm telling you right now,

07:50.954 --> 07:52.507
forget about that boy.

07:52.601 --> 07:55.536
I know all about loving a messed-up man,

07:55.561 --> 07:58.210
- like your father.
- Derek is nothing like Dad.

07:58.235 --> 08:00.358
Yes, he is, darling. He
wants the spotlight, too.

08:00.383 --> 08:02.327
He just wants it in a different way.

08:02.724 --> 08:04.624
You don't even know him to say that.

08:04.896 --> 08:07.579
I'll pay this boy's bail
if you leave this zoo.

08:07.604 --> 08:09.004
I'm not just gonna abandon him.

08:09.106 --> 08:11.573
Right now I feel like I'm
doing something that's important

08:11.641 --> 08:13.308
and real to me.

08:13.377 --> 08:15.143
Besides, I don't need your money.

08:15.212 --> 08:16.644
Miss Carlotta and the
girls are throwing me

08:16.713 --> 08:17.874
a block party fund-raiser.

08:17.899 --> 08:20.682
You really believe these people
are gonna pay for him to get out?

08:20.784 --> 08:22.650
I mean, for God's sake, Alexandra,

08:22.719 --> 08:24.940
they can't even afford to pay attention.

08:28.198 --> 08:29.900
Let Moses help.

08:29.925 --> 08:32.519
He's been our family lawyer for ages.

08:33.456 --> 08:35.130
Okay.

08:35.308 --> 08:38.010
African-American male, six-three,

08:38.034 --> 08:40.368
weighing approximately 210.

08:40.437 --> 08:42.437
Single bullet wound to the chest,

08:42.462 --> 08:44.595
and by the recent
stab wound on his back,

08:44.620 --> 08:46.220
I'd say this is personal.

08:46.245 --> 08:47.831
I'll run his DNA through the system.

08:48.155 --> 08:51.170
Shouldn't be too long before
we get an I.D. on this guy.

08:52.952 --> 08:55.147
Got some new fish up in here!

08:56.821 --> 08:58.303
What's up, boy?

08:59.421 --> 09:01.365
Come on, pretty boy.

09:02.891 --> 09:04.881
- Derek.
- Uh-uh.

09:04.906 --> 09:06.451
No contact.

09:19.882 --> 09:21.749
I just got the report about the officer.

09:21.818 --> 09:23.083
This isn't good.

09:23.152 --> 09:24.701
If you're lucky, they'll
offer you a plea deal

09:24.726 --> 09:26.513
with a minimum of five years.

09:26.538 --> 09:28.060
But he's innocent, Moses.

09:28.085 --> 09:30.014
BLM would never do anything like this.

09:30.039 --> 09:32.296
Are they even trying to find
the goons that crashed the rally?

09:32.321 --> 09:34.274
Look, unless somebody comes
forward with new evidence,

09:34.377 --> 09:36.543
you're their number one suspect.

09:38.447 --> 09:40.394
Could you give us a moment, sir?

09:40.419 --> 09:41.542
Sure.

09:49.621 --> 09:51.454
No contact!

09:55.092 --> 09:56.998
That plea deal...

09:57.199 --> 09:58.465
I might consider that.

09:58.534 --> 09:59.675
Are you insane?

09:59.777 --> 10:01.287
That's like admitting you're guilty.

10:01.312 --> 10:02.770
I mean, they know other
people are involved.

10:02.838 --> 10:03.928
Something will come up,

10:03.953 --> 10:05.569
- a video or something.
- Alex, stop it...

10:05.594 --> 10:07.934
it's me up against a
bunch of pissed off cops.

10:07.959 --> 10:09.286
I won't have a fair trial.

10:09.311 --> 10:10.698
They've been after me for months.

10:10.723 --> 10:13.324
Derek, look at all you've fought for.

10:14.093 --> 10:15.895
You'd give that up now?

10:16.436 --> 10:18.852
It's already been decided, baby girl.

10:18.921 --> 10:20.821
It's how the system works.

10:23.668 --> 10:25.520
When I met you...

10:26.354 --> 10:28.566
you said that you were
gonna save the world.

10:29.269 --> 10:31.615
But you can't even save yourself.

10:34.331 --> 10:36.365
Maybe you're not who I thought you were.

10:36.482 --> 10:38.170
Maybe I'm not.

10:52.700 --> 10:54.310

- Cross, up, down.

10:54.351 --> 10:55.514

Star, you ever been locked up?

11:24.239 --> 11:25.828
Yeah.

11:26.215 --> 11:28.015
Couple times.

11:28.474 --> 11:30.474
Petty stuff. Assault.

11:31.575 --> 11:33.294
Why are you asking me?

11:34.038 --> 11:35.170
Mm.

11:36.630 --> 11:38.513
You a sometimey bitch.

11:38.538 --> 11:40.556

'Sup?

11:47.946 --> 11:49.384
How's Derek?

11:49.409 --> 11:51.087
His head's getting twisted,

11:51.112 --> 11:52.798
talking about taking a plea deal.

11:52.823 --> 11:53.922
That's what they do to you, man.

11:53.991 --> 11:55.314
They're trying to get in his head.

11:55.339 --> 11:57.900
We can't raise $25K at a block party.

11:58.763 --> 12:00.489
We got to try.

12:01.474 --> 12:03.246
Her mom can help.

12:03.271 --> 12:04.770
What about your mom?

12:04.839 --> 12:07.419
- Why don't you ask her for some help?
- Never.

12:07.471 --> 12:10.396
Hmm. Well, I wonder
who else has got money.

12:15.983 --> 12:17.550
Who? No.

12:17.618 --> 12:18.928
No, I can't.

12:18.953 --> 12:21.153
His mama's still mad
about that shopping spree.

12:21.178 --> 12:23.612
You know the last thing I
ever want to do is beg you.

12:23.967 --> 12:26.069
But I'm desperate here.

12:26.094 --> 12:28.209
I mean, you can at least ask.

12:28.730 --> 12:29.895
Right?

12:32.042 --> 12:34.940
I cannot believe I'm about
to help your super rich ass.

12:34.965 --> 12:36.173
- Bring it in.
- Ha, ha.

12:36.299 --> 12:37.346
Oh...

12:37.371 --> 12:38.565
- Ah...
- What is this?

12:38.590 --> 12:40.355
- It's called kindness.
- I hate it.

12:40.380 --> 12:41.559
- Oh, it's weird.
- Get off of me.

12:41.584 --> 12:42.687
- Ugh!
- Okay. I hate it, too.

12:42.712 --> 12:44.121
Good afternoon, ladies.

12:44.285 --> 12:45.911
Alex, you doing all right?

12:45.980 --> 12:47.082
Good.

12:47.107 --> 12:49.792
Anyway, listen. Somebody
actually posted a video

12:49.817 --> 12:52.341
of your performance on the
Atlanta NextFest Web site.

12:52.366 --> 12:54.445
And I'm telling you right
now, the reaction to it,

12:54.470 --> 12:56.113
the response has been off the charts.

12:56.138 --> 12:57.871
- I've never seen anything like it.
- Oh, my God.

12:57.896 --> 12:59.879
There are 30,000 views on this.

12:59.895 --> 13:01.962
I'm not even in this. That's not okay.

13:01.987 --> 13:03.144
30,000 overnight?

13:03.169 --> 13:04.988
Oh, my gosh. That's so dope.

13:05.013 --> 13:07.121
Yeah. It is dope.

13:07.307 --> 13:09.129
Can we have a word?

13:14.963 --> 13:17.986
Get on the phone and tell them
to take that video down right now.

13:18.011 --> 13:19.680
If you want to continue
being our manager,

13:19.748 --> 13:21.658
- you would've already done it by now.
- Look, Star.

13:21.683 --> 13:23.250
30,000 likes is no joke.

13:23.319 --> 13:24.979
Okay? That video is on fire.

13:25.004 --> 13:26.775
Besides, the judges
have already seen it.

13:26.800 --> 13:28.088
And you know what? I got a plan.

13:28.113 --> 13:30.343
If your plan doesn't involve
getting that video pulled,

13:30.383 --> 13:32.354
I'm not interested in hearing it.

13:33.373 --> 13:34.539

I'm sorry.

17:26.281 --> 17:29.663
I'm sorry. I just been on edge
since this whole riot thing,

17:29.732 --> 17:31.131
and Danielle, and...

17:31.266 --> 17:33.172
It's just...

17:33.516 --> 17:36.069
Look, I know you're saving up
for the surgery and everything,

17:36.094 --> 17:39.195
but can't you just... put it off?

17:40.516 --> 17:42.944
You know Derek could
really use that money.

17:42.969 --> 17:44.477
Derek?

17:44.502 --> 17:46.637
You gonna slap me in
my face and turn around

17:46.662 --> 17:49.396
and ask me for my money, for Derek?

17:50.734 --> 17:52.152
No.

17:52.254 --> 17:55.523
I already scheduled my sex
change surgery for next week.

17:56.239 --> 17:57.601
So no.

17:59.685 --> 18:01.359
Praise the Lord.

18:16.278 --> 18:18.445
You know, Derek's in jail.

18:18.861 --> 18:21.148
We're trying to raise
the $25K for his bail bond

18:21.216 --> 18:24.783
by having this block party fund-raiser.

18:25.009 --> 18:28.103
I figured, since you're an NFL player...

18:28.128 --> 18:29.995
hometown pride or whatever...

18:30.020 --> 18:32.453
you might want to
donate to a good cause.

18:33.674 --> 18:35.673
$5K, $10K or something?

18:36.306 --> 18:38.139
Isn't that called, like, a tax write-off

18:38.164 --> 18:39.908
for people like you?

18:41.939 --> 18:43.837
I guess you were just
waiting until you got me

18:43.906 --> 18:47.041
into a vulnerable position
to ask me for money, huh?

18:48.787 --> 18:50.521
No. That's not what I'm saying.

18:50.546 --> 18:51.619
I mean, you must just think

18:51.644 --> 18:54.617
I'm some dumb rich jock
you can easily play.

18:54.642 --> 18:55.978
Hunter, you're trippin' right now.

18:56.003 --> 18:57.713
I mean, is that all I am to you?

18:57.738 --> 18:59.037
Huh? A side hustle?

18:59.154 --> 19:00.242
You know, you're just like all the other

19:00.267 --> 19:02.088
gold-digging sluts I've ever had.

19:02.113 --> 19:03.758
Here, you, you want some money? Huh?

19:03.798 --> 19:05.767
You want some money?
Here. Take some money.

19:05.792 --> 19:07.725
Here, take it. Take some money.

19:08.900 --> 19:09.965
Take the money.

19:09.990 --> 19:11.823
Take it. Take some money.

19:11.848 --> 19:13.306
You know what?

19:13.936 --> 19:16.744
Take this $10K and
buy your ugly-ass mama

19:16.769 --> 19:19.431
another tanning booth, you mama's bitch!

19:42.364 --> 19:44.331
What's going on in here?

20:21.749 --> 20:23.462
How'd it go with Hunter?

20:23.487 --> 20:26.422
We'll find another way. We always do.

20:26.463 --> 20:28.017
You okay, sexy?

20:28.042 --> 20:29.141
No.

20:29.727 --> 20:31.660

20:32.602 --> 20:33.993
It's all good.

20:34.018 --> 20:36.152
Weren't we just supposed
to start a girl group?

20:38.502 --> 20:40.368
Now look at us.

20:41.353 --> 20:42.907

20:54.451 --> 20:55.884
Nah.

20:55.981 --> 20:57.118
Now, TLC?

20:58.447 --> 20:59.540

21:01.231 --> 21:02.797
Ah...

21:02.833 --> 21:04.212
It's all good.

21:04.237 --> 21:05.953
We still got our eye on the prize.

21:05.978 --> 21:07.819
Let's go. We have so much
to do for this block party.

21:07.844 --> 21:09.070

for Star, Simone and Alex.

25:07.128 --> 25:09.058
And the Ponytail Sisters!

25:10.433 --> 25:12.330
All right, so I got a special guest

25:12.355 --> 25:13.654
who wants to say a few words

25:13.689 --> 25:15.377
before y'all start shaking your asses.

25:15.402 --> 25:18.892
Y'all know him as the quarterback
for our beloved Talons.

25:18.928 --> 25:20.136
He is

25:20.161 --> 25:23.374
the very legendary, the
very talented, incomparable

25:23.399 --> 25:26.792
Hunter Morgan!

25:32.107 --> 25:33.539
Thanks, Bruce.

25:34.466 --> 25:37.034
Actually, I have a
surprise of my own tonight

25:37.059 --> 25:39.286
for a very special lady.

25:40.622 --> 25:43.495
My guest is not only a living legend

25:43.520 --> 25:47.521
but quite possibly the
coolest person on this planet.

25:47.556 --> 25:50.888
Everybody, put your hands together

25:50.913 --> 25:52.021
for Pumpkin.

25:55.024 --> 25:56.958
Oh, my God, this
better not be happening!

25:57.066 --> 25:58.565
I must be hallucinating.

25:59.935 --> 26:01.201
What up?

26:01.237 --> 26:02.836
Yeah!

26:03.504 --> 26:06.273
Y'all looking real good, I see y'all.

26:06.934 --> 26:08.192
So, look,

26:08.217 --> 26:10.817
I came out here from Cali

26:11.312 --> 26:12.996
just to talk to y'all.

26:13.481 --> 26:15.049
Now, tonight

26:15.084 --> 26:17.973
is about raising money
for a community hero,

26:17.998 --> 26:19.119
Derek Jones.

26:19.155 --> 26:20.614
Right?

26:22.058 --> 26:25.121
'Cause y'all see what's going
on out here in these streets.

26:25.215 --> 26:27.558
Gunning people down like animals.

26:27.583 --> 26:29.517
And I think it's messed up

26:29.552 --> 26:31.825
that they trying to
do him dirty like that.

26:32.935 --> 26:34.137
And personally,

26:34.162 --> 26:36.285
I'm sick and tired of seeing injustices

26:36.310 --> 26:38.777
play out the way they do
with our young brothers.

26:39.926 --> 26:42.051
But, see, Derek, he
one of the lucky ones.

26:42.331 --> 26:44.064
He's still alive.

26:44.100 --> 26:47.161
And even though he's
locked up right now,

26:47.186 --> 26:49.069
he has a chance.

26:49.115 --> 26:50.940
So I'm asking all of y'all,

26:50.965 --> 26:52.606
'cause y'all looking real good,

26:52.631 --> 26:54.707
to dig deep into your pockets,

26:54.732 --> 26:56.215
your wallets, Gucci bags,

26:56.240 --> 26:58.774
whatever you got to help his cause.

26:58.799 --> 27:00.725
I truly appreciate y'all.

27:00.750 --> 27:02.683
Thank you. Thank you.

27:04.475 --> 27:06.746
Y'all ready to get this place cracking?

27:06.771 --> 27:09.205
Get it popping, baby. Let's get it.

27:09.653 --> 27:11.158
♪ ♪

27:13.005 --> 27:14.945
Whoo!

27:19.958 --> 27:21.734
Hey, Pumpkin.

27:22.173 --> 27:25.078
I just wanted to say, I
would literally kill somebody

27:25.103 --> 27:26.382
to work with you one day.

27:27.598 --> 27:29.422
Be careful what you wish for, girl.

27:29.447 --> 27:30.586
Pumpkin?

27:31.425 --> 27:33.812
Oh, snap!

27:33.831 --> 27:37.165
Carlotta Brown from Mixed Harmony!

27:37.635 --> 27:40.502
- Dang, woman, how long has it been?
- Too long.

27:40.527 --> 27:42.578
You remember that night at Summer Jam?

27:42.603 --> 27:44.308
- Girl...
- We were so broke,

27:44.333 --> 27:46.157
we had to share each other's shoes.

27:46.182 --> 27:48.010
And you remember when my heel came off?

27:48.035 --> 27:49.268
I'm dancing around like,

27:49.293 --> 27:50.651
- "Eh! Eh!"
- That was...

27:50.676 --> 27:53.010
Yeah, but you had everybody going, "Eh!"

27:53.035 --> 27:54.260
I said, "No way!

27:54.285 --> 27:56.328
They so stupid, they don't even know."

27:56.353 --> 27:58.033
- Girl, we crazy.
- Oh, my goodness.

27:58.058 --> 27:59.723
Well, what happened to that girl, Mary?

27:59.748 --> 28:02.616
Oh, Mary, she passed
away a few years back.

28:02.651 --> 28:04.351
But you're looking at
her baby right here.

28:04.386 --> 28:05.719
No way.

28:05.754 --> 28:08.355
Girl, you got a voice
just like your mama.

28:08.390 --> 28:10.235
- Thank you.
- And you got a good dude

28:10.260 --> 28:12.314
that would do all of this here?

28:12.339 --> 28:14.439
Now, that's somebody
you need to stick with.

28:14.464 --> 28:16.088
Hunter's a keeper.

28:16.432 --> 28:18.799
Well, Carlotta, it was
good seeing you, girl.

28:18.834 --> 28:19.877
Good to see you, too.

28:19.902 --> 28:21.402
Keep doing your thing, now.

28:21.427 --> 28:23.268
- 'Cause you made it. You made it.
- Eh...!

28:24.551 --> 28:26.250
Star, we'll talk later, girl.

28:26.275 --> 28:27.407
- Please.
- I'll see y'all.

28:27.443 --> 28:28.809
- All right.
- For sure.

28:30.430 --> 28:32.664
I'm gonna head over here
and pack up the booth.

28:34.575 --> 28:35.875
Excuse me.

28:38.189 --> 28:39.953
Hey, beautiful people.

28:39.988 --> 28:41.923
Thank you so much for
coming out for Derek.

28:41.948 --> 28:44.635
Come on, y'all, free Derek! Free Derek!

28:44.660 --> 28:45.853
Free Derek!

28:45.878 --> 28:47.711
Free Derek! Free Derek!

28:47.736 --> 28:49.174
- Free Derek!
- Shh! Quiet down.

28:49.199 --> 28:50.916
Tonight we raised...

28:51.291 --> 28:55.068
$14,942 for his bail bond.

28:59.547 --> 29:01.652
All right, people, you
don't got to go home,

29:01.687 --> 29:03.313
but you got to get the hell out of here.

29:03.338 --> 29:05.477
Thank you for coming. Have a good night.

29:05.502 --> 29:06.868
Thank you for giving.

29:08.511 --> 29:10.867
We still need about $10K.

29:10.892 --> 29:12.091
What are our options?

29:12.116 --> 29:13.649
It's not like we got time.

29:36.377 --> 29:37.709
Hey.

29:38.881 --> 29:40.358
Hey.

29:47.890 --> 29:49.855
I support what you're doing.

29:51.042 --> 29:53.238
I know you're doing what you got to do.

29:56.965 --> 29:58.886
You really mean that, Mama?

29:58.911 --> 30:00.269
I do.

30:03.167 --> 30:06.817
I know over the years
I've given you a hard time,

30:07.089 --> 30:09.823
but I just want us to move forward.

30:10.776 --> 30:12.546
You're still my baby.

30:13.440 --> 30:14.761
I love you, Mom.

30:14.786 --> 30:16.628
I love you, too.

30:17.761 --> 30:19.485
You know, I want us to get a blessing.

30:19.510 --> 30:21.710
I'm gonna call Pastor Harris
and see if he'll come over

30:21.735 --> 30:23.407
and just talk to us.

30:26.711 --> 30:29.196
I know you don't do church.

30:29.598 --> 30:32.065
But I know you know the Lord, Cotton.

30:33.340 --> 30:34.940
Okay, Mama.

30:42.377 --> 30:44.834
- Alexandra.
- Mom, you were right.

30:45.043 --> 30:46.343
I want to come home.

30:46.368 --> 30:48.664
I'm not cut out for this life.

30:51.109 --> 30:53.153
Well, what changed your mind?

30:53.178 --> 30:55.178
Derek's talking about taking a plea.

30:55.223 --> 30:56.664
It's stupid.

30:56.998 --> 30:59.539
Mom, I don't think I
want that type of guy.

31:00.195 --> 31:02.662
But I do want to help
him before I leave.

31:02.698 --> 31:04.309
His bail is short.

31:04.334 --> 31:07.903
You told me, if I'd come
home, you'd help him.

31:08.503 --> 31:09.817
Help him.

31:09.842 --> 31:12.348
- I'm coming home.
- Okay.

31:12.543 --> 31:13.840
I'm proud of you.

31:13.875 --> 31:15.770
You came to your senses.

31:16.178 --> 31:18.950
We can be wheels up at 10:00 a.m. sharp.

31:19.181 --> 31:21.403
- I'll be ready.
- Wonderful.

31:21.428 --> 31:23.128
I'll set it up.

31:23.622 --> 31:24.840
Hey, Sprocket.

31:24.865 --> 31:26.676
I love you, my darling.

31:27.055 --> 31:28.598
I love you, too.

31:38.307 --> 31:41.416
All right, Jahil, we'll
see you in a minute.

31:42.211 --> 31:45.666
Jahil wants us to meet him at
the studio in, like, an hour.

31:45.691 --> 31:47.458
- Oh...
- All done.

31:47.776 --> 31:49.442
- Where's Alex?
- I don't know.

31:49.514 --> 31:50.746
She left earlier this morning

31:50.771 --> 31:52.337
and didn't say where she was going.

31:57.899 --> 32:00.527
Oh, there's Prince Charming.

32:00.562 --> 32:02.529
Well, I got to go shower and get ready.

32:02.564 --> 32:04.831
All right, find Alex and
tell her to meet us later.

32:04.867 --> 32:06.063
Okay.

32:12.514 --> 32:15.155
What are you doing here? Please leave.

32:15.180 --> 32:17.265
I haven't slept,

32:17.290 --> 32:20.272
and I'm a wreck, and I
really, really need to talk.

32:21.116 --> 32:23.083
So talk.

32:23.118 --> 32:25.619
I know there's no
excuse for what I did...

32:25.654 --> 32:28.221
and I don't know what
happened. I just snapped.

32:28.257 --> 32:30.457
I've never done anything
like that before.

32:31.264 --> 32:32.898
And I guess I've just been burned

32:32.923 --> 32:34.570
by so many crazy bitches

32:34.595 --> 32:36.335
that I just lost it...

32:37.089 --> 32:40.484
and I'm... I'm so sorry.

32:41.715 --> 32:43.471
So, you thought you
could bring me Pumpkin

32:43.496 --> 32:45.162
and it would all be forgiven?

32:45.858 --> 32:46.947
Because no.

32:46.972 --> 32:49.893
I know that that will never
be enough of an apology...

32:50.479 --> 32:52.385
and I don't expect for you to,

32:52.410 --> 32:54.783
to forgive me just like that.

32:55.481 --> 32:58.621
What I'm asking for is another chance.

33:01.004 --> 33:02.832
I can't do that right now.

33:07.896 --> 33:10.331
- Where are you going?
- For a walk.

33:10.903 --> 33:12.505
Alone.

33:14.157 --> 33:16.401
Cotton, 20 years ago,

33:17.406 --> 33:20.374
I broke off my relationship with God.

33:21.003 --> 33:23.526
I was in this exact place.

33:23.833 --> 33:27.753
The church was no place
for a sinner like me.

33:28.308 --> 33:31.718
I asked for God to put
forgiveness in my heart,

33:31.754 --> 33:35.745
and only through prayer,
I was led back to God.

33:36.091 --> 33:38.284
I'm doing this for my mother.

33:38.636 --> 33:41.386
And she appreciates you for it.

33:43.165 --> 33:45.332
I'm going to ask that you...

33:45.367 --> 33:47.477
- join my hand in prayer.
- Hold on,

33:47.502 --> 33:49.201
let me get my Bible.

33:53.760 --> 33:56.327
Here, hold my hand in prayer.

33:57.252 --> 33:59.467
Bow our heads as we pray.

34:00.491 --> 34:03.380
Dear Lord, forgive us

34:03.405 --> 34:05.077
for our failures.

34:05.102 --> 34:07.905
Guide this mother and child relationship

34:07.930 --> 34:10.170
- the way it ought to be.
- Yes.

34:10.196 --> 34:13.655
I call on you, Lord, as I pray.

34:14.458 --> 34:17.226
This young soul has been lost

34:17.251 --> 34:18.784
for so long.

34:18.809 --> 34:23.045
Please, God, bring
Arnold back to his mother.

34:23.228 --> 34:25.502
Let Arnold renounce

34:25.527 --> 34:27.958
this gender confusion...

34:27.984 --> 34:30.745
and purge him of sin.

34:30.770 --> 34:33.603
As Deuteronomy 22:5 says:

34:33.629 --> 34:37.455
"A woman must not wear men's clothing,

34:37.480 --> 34:39.893
"nor a man wear woman's clothing,

34:39.918 --> 34:44.275
"for the Lord, your God,
detest anyone who does this."

34:44.552 --> 34:46.947
Please, Father God...

34:47.541 --> 34:51.135
refute the demons inside this child.

34:51.487 --> 34:53.199
Open your heart.

34:53.235 --> 34:56.760
Do you accept the Lord
Jesus Christ as your savior?

34:56.784 --> 34:59.552
I don't know. Yes, I want to.

34:59.775 --> 35:03.416
Do you accept the Lord as your savior?

35:03.812 --> 35:05.432
Say it right now.

35:05.457 --> 35:06.651
Say it!

35:06.706 --> 35:09.651
Yes, yes, I accept God.

35:09.676 --> 35:11.676
Your name is Arnold.

35:11.712 --> 35:13.845
You were born a man.

35:13.881 --> 35:16.848
"I am a man." Say it.

35:16.884 --> 35:18.446
Say it!

35:18.471 --> 35:19.987
"I am a man.

35:20.012 --> 35:21.979
My name is Arnold."

35:22.004 --> 35:23.307
Say it with conviction.

35:23.332 --> 35:25.759
Believe it from your heart. Say it!

35:25.784 --> 35:27.362
"I am a man."

35:27.387 --> 35:29.821
- I'm not a...
- "I am a man." Say it.

35:29.846 --> 35:32.034
Am I... I'm not...

35:33.985 --> 35:37.954

Thank you, Father God.

Don't touch me. Get off me.

37:48.513 --> 37:50.413
You set me up.

38:01.573 --> 38:03.617
- I was just trying to help.
- Get out.

38:03.825 --> 38:05.148
Get out.

38:15.361 --> 38:17.465
You asked for my help!

38:17.586 --> 38:19.004
You did!

38:19.794 --> 38:22.238
Both of y'all are confused.

39:14.982 --> 39:16.700
Do it.

39:18.555 --> 39:21.216
Pull the trigger, you stupid bitch.

39:23.661 --> 39:27.161
What is wrong with
you? Put that gun down.

39:27.427 --> 39:29.677
Put that gun down.

39:32.759 --> 39:34.318
Cotton.

39:41.413 --> 39:42.907
You know how nasty your
room would've looked

39:42.943 --> 39:44.538
if you had pulled that stunt?

39:44.778 --> 39:47.045
I would've had to clean blood
out of these glitter curtains.

39:48.927 --> 39:50.693
Are you laughing?

39:56.056 --> 39:58.018
What happened?

39:58.913 --> 40:01.581
I can't believe my ma
would do that to me.

40:03.315 --> 40:05.979
But at least you got a mama, I guess,

40:06.434 --> 40:08.089
crazy.

40:09.581 --> 40:11.917
Is Simone rubbing off on me?

40:11.942 --> 40:13.340
I think so.

40:20.699 --> 40:23.081
Where are you, dear? You
should've been here an hour ago.

40:23.116 --> 40:24.463
I'm not coming.

40:24.488 --> 40:26.082
What do you mean you're not coming?

40:26.107 --> 40:28.113
Moses posted bail for that boy.

40:28.138 --> 40:29.521
I realized something, Mom.

40:29.556 --> 40:30.855
I've never felt this way

40:30.891 --> 40:32.742
about anybody in my life,

40:33.249 --> 40:34.927
and I can't just leave.

40:35.411 --> 40:38.063
Alexandra, we had a deal!

40:38.098 --> 40:40.131
Yeah, just like all
those times you made deals

40:40.167 --> 40:43.078
to take me to The Nutcracker
if I poured you one last drink,

40:43.103 --> 40:45.804
but you were too drunk. I never saw it.

40:45.839 --> 40:48.006
Or how you and Dad made a
deal to launch my solo career,

40:48.041 --> 40:50.939
but Dad squashed it 'cause he
didn't want me on his label.

40:52.541 --> 40:54.665
This is exactly what
I was talking about,

40:54.690 --> 40:56.952
the influence of those street
girls they have on you...

40:56.977 --> 40:58.310
Please, Mom.

40:58.335 --> 41:00.485
I learned these street smarts on my own.

41:00.520 --> 41:03.967
Besides, ten grand is
like a Chanel bag for you.

41:03.992 --> 41:05.327
Don't worry, I'll pay you back.

41:05.352 --> 41:07.927
You really love that boy, Alexandra?

41:07.952 --> 41:10.728
Yeah. I really do.

41:10.764 --> 41:14.624
Mark my words, he'll break your heart.

41:15.535 --> 41:17.235
I'll call you back later.

41:31.705 --> 41:34.928
"I came not to call the righteous,

41:35.297 --> 41:37.951
but sinners to repentance."

41:48.902 --> 41:50.969
Forgive me, Father,

41:51.469 --> 41:53.224
for I have sinned.

41:54.165 --> 41:56.701
Who am I to judge?

42:13.026 --> 42:14.726
We ran your John Doe's DNA.

42:15.398 --> 42:17.162
It came back a match
to the one in a car.

42:18.194 --> 42:19.664
We ran the plates and it's a rental.

42:19.699 --> 42:22.593
- Last rented to an Otis Leecan.
- Otis Leecan?

42:22.915 --> 42:24.380
I have an open case on him.

42:24.405 --> 42:26.273
Looks like we got our John Doe.

42:28.208 --> 42:29.841
Derek's still got to go to trial,

42:29.876 --> 42:31.509
but at least he's out.

42:31.545 --> 42:33.411
I still can't believe you
pulled that on your mom.

42:33.446 --> 42:34.546
I didn't think you had it in you.

42:34.581 --> 42:36.257
- I did.
- Thank you.

42:37.484 --> 42:39.069
I'm glad you guys are here.

42:39.624 --> 42:40.984
What is she doing here?

42:41.009 --> 42:42.675
Is this about Atlanta NextFest?

42:42.700 --> 42:45.301
This better only be about
handling what we discussed.

42:45.326 --> 42:47.035
Look, I wanted to talk
to you all earlier,

42:47.060 --> 42:48.571
but I didn't really get a chance.

42:48.596 --> 42:49.694
So, here's the deal.

42:49.729 --> 42:51.799
I have an inside source
at the Atlanta NextFest.

42:51.824 --> 42:54.399
The competition is a lot
more fierce than I thought,

42:54.424 --> 42:57.167
and I'm not really feeling
like I want to lose this thing.

42:57.192 --> 42:59.277
I'm expanding our audience.

43:00.667 --> 43:02.386
I'm adding Eva to the group.

43:08.255 --> 43:09.688
Okay.

43:11.279 --> 43:12.645
I quit.

43:14.349 --> 43:16.114
What's the deal with all the cops?

43:16.139 --> 43:17.287
They're searching around.

43:18.775 --> 43:20.049
Questioning us.

43:21.098 --> 43:23.028
This whole thing could
blow up in our faces.

43:24.708 --> 43:26.302
You're being considered
as a person of interest

43:26.327 --> 43:27.872
in the murder of Otis Leecan.

43:27.897 --> 43:29.700
You can't keep me in here like this.

43:29.725 --> 43:30.942
Do I need a lawyer?

43:30.967 --> 43:32.684
This is not going away, Talk to me.

43:32.709 --> 43:34.162
I think we found what
we were looking for.

43:34.187 --> 43:35.185
You're lying.

43:35.210 --> 43:38.046
Your interaction with Otis
is the last time he was seen alive.
