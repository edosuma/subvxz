00:24.923 --> 00:27.125
He is such a brave boy.

00:28.593 --> 00:32.177
"I am the young man, full
of strength and hope..."

00:32.179 --> 00:35.482
I can not sit idly by in Atlanta...

00:35.483 --> 00:39.235
and not be concerned about
what happens in Birmingham.

00:39.236 --> 00:44.190
You can never whip these birds, if you
don't keep you and them separate.

00:46.160 --> 00:48.061
That's a Watson noggin.

00:48.829 --> 00:51.613
I want you to know we
can be outstanding.

00:55.001 --> 01:00.122
Let freedom ring from every hill
and molehill in Mississippi.

01:01.508 --> 01:04.126
This is about how to
survive a tornado.

01:08.214 --> 01:10.631
Y'all be careful, okay?

01:10.632 --> 01:12.600
I draw the line in the dust...

01:12.601 --> 01:15.052
I will not rest...

01:15.053 --> 01:20.057
until we are able to make this
kind of witness in this city...

01:20.058 --> 01:23.561
We did produce a
non-segregated march...

01:23.562 --> 01:25.063
We don't serve your kind here.

01:25.064 --> 01:26.948
1960-what? 1960-who?

01:26.949 --> 01:29.017
Just shut your stupid mouth.

01:30.234 --> 01:31.985
Where's the colored-only
bathrooms downtown?

01:31.986 --> 01:37.407
There's room here for my
children to play and grow...

01:37.408 --> 01:40.327
Outstanding, Mr. Watson...

01:45.883 --> 01:48.717
Without any outside help
from the federal government.

01:48.718 --> 01:51.420
You know where the
entrance is, right?

01:51.721 --> 01:58.043
When Birmingham becomes more equal, the
entire country becomes more equal.

02:03.850 --> 02:08.070
In 1963, when I was 12 years old...

02:08.071 --> 02:11.573
I lived in Flint, Michigan
with my dad, my mom...

02:11.574 --> 02:14.075
my angelic, little sister Joetta...

02:14.076 --> 02:17.078
and my troubled,
older brother Byron.

02:17.079 --> 02:21.081
And by troubled, I mean he was
always getting into trouble.

02:21.082 --> 02:23.083
I remember a lot about that year.

02:23.084 --> 02:25.087
Including the major snow storm...

02:25.088 --> 02:29.874
and freezing cold weather we
had that first day of spring.

02:29.875 --> 02:36.630
It was so cold, that if you spit, the slob
would be an ice cube before it hit the ground.

02:36.631 --> 02:40.217
It was even cold inside our house.

02:40.218 --> 02:44.221
Maybe it was the cold or maybe
it was Byron's troubles.

02:44.222 --> 02:46.807
But somehow, on that March day...

02:46.808 --> 02:50.143
when we all sat close together
to generate some heat...

02:50.144 --> 02:55.348
the idea of going to Birmingham
for the summer was born.

02:55.565 --> 02:58.951
And spring has already
sprung down south.

02:58.952 --> 03:03.373
In Atlanta, Georgia, the temperatures are
expected to reach the mid-70's this week.

03:03.374 --> 03:07.994
Atlanta... that is right around
the corner from my hometown.

03:07.995 --> 03:11.830
- From your Grandma Sands. I miss my mama.
- Wilona.

03:11.831 --> 03:14.916
I haven't seen her in so long.

03:14.917 --> 03:17.252
Maybe I should have
listened to Hank Henderson.

03:17.253 --> 03:20.422
- Who?
- Not that sorry story.

03:20.423 --> 03:21.922
You gotta let me tell about
what happened to him.

03:21.923 --> 03:24.426
Oh, well, there's not a
whole lot to tell...

03:24.427 --> 03:30.931
just a story about a young
girl who made a bad choice.

03:30.932 --> 03:32.817
But if you're gonna tell it, make
sure you get the facts straight.

03:32.818 --> 03:34.818
Oh, boy, here we go.

03:34.819 --> 03:35.853
Come on, Daddy, tell us.

03:35.854 --> 03:36.615
Yeah, tell us.

03:36.855 --> 03:39.189
Kids, I almost wasn't your daddy.

03:39.190 --> 03:44.411
You almost had a clown for a
daddy named Hambone Henderson.

03:44.412 --> 03:45.913
Hambone? What kind of name is that?

03:45.914 --> 03:47.414
Exactly.

03:47.415 --> 03:49.916
Daniel Watson, you stop right there. You're
the one who started that Hambone nonsense.

03:49.917 --> 03:52.918
But it stuck with him, didn't it?
Hambone Henderson.

03:52.919 --> 03:54.920
Me and your granddaddy
came up with that name...

03:54.921 --> 03:57.289
because the boy had a head
shaped just like a hambone...

03:57.290 --> 04:00.677
and more knots and lumps on
his head than a dinosaur.

04:00.678 --> 04:02.963
So when y'all sit here
giving me dirty looks...

04:03.130 --> 04:05.964
ask yourself would you rather
be cool like your daddy...

04:05.965 --> 04:09.052
or would you rather be a clown
like Hambone Henderson?

04:09.053 --> 04:12.020
Mommy, is that true?

04:12.021 --> 04:13.305
Kenny might be a Hambone.

04:13.723 --> 04:17.760
Naw, Kenny, that's a Watson noggin.

04:18.144 --> 04:21.644
Hambone Henderson proposed to your
momma at the same time that I did...

04:21.646 --> 04:23.115
and he fought dirty, too.

04:23.116 --> 04:26.951
He told her a pack of lies about me
and when she didn't believe them...

04:26.952 --> 04:29.320
he started telling her a
pack of lies about Flint.

04:29.321 --> 04:30.789
And this is how he talk, he say...

04:30.790 --> 04:36.660
"Wilona, I heard tell that far up north
supposed to be colder than inside an icebox."

04:36.661 --> 04:40.698
Said, "I seen it in a movie, yeah,
I think it was made in Flint.

04:40.999 --> 04:43.001
"Movie named 'Nanook of the North'.

04:43.002 --> 04:49.006
"Yup, I think it was made up in Flint.
Uh-huh, Flint, Mitch-again."

04:49.007 --> 04:52.007
He said, "Folks up there, they live
in these things called igloos."

04:52.008 --> 04:57.180
He said, "You a 'Bama gal, you ain't gonna
be too happy living up in no igloo."

04:57.181 --> 05:01.151
Living in Flint is like
living in an igloo.

05:01.152 --> 05:03.820
I knew I should have
listened to Hank.

05:03.821 --> 05:07.906
Now maybe you would have had some lumpy
heads instead of peanut heads...

05:07.907 --> 05:09.907
but at least you'd have been warm.

05:09.908 --> 05:11.911
Now you know Birmingham
is a good place.

05:11.912 --> 05:17.116
Life is slower, but people are
good, church-going people...

05:17.117 --> 05:19.118
they're friendly.

05:19.119 --> 05:22.121
Yes, it's just a laugh
a minute up there.

05:22.122 --> 05:24.956
Let's see, where's the
colored-only bathroom downtown?

05:24.957 --> 05:26.175
- What?
- Colored what?

05:26.176 --> 05:27.543
Colored-only.

05:27.544 --> 05:30.996
Nah, you know that's
not what I mean.

05:31.380 --> 05:32.879
Things aren't perfect down there...

05:32.880 --> 05:36.184
but people are more honest
about the way they feel.

05:36.185 --> 05:40.688
And folks down there do know
how to respect their parents.

05:40.689 --> 05:42.023
Mm-hm.

05:42.024 --> 05:44.976
And I really do miss my momma.

05:44.977 --> 05:45.978
Okay, okay, okay...

05:45.979 --> 05:48.980
I'm gonna call the
landlord again...

05:48.981 --> 05:51.732
see if he can get over here
now and fix this furnace.

05:52.033 --> 05:53.732
But if he can't, I'm gonna
call Aunt Cydney...

05:53.733 --> 05:55.819
and we gonna have to go over
there and stay with her.

05:55.820 --> 05:59.290
Byron, get up. Kenny, get up.
Go scrape off that car.

05:59.291 --> 06:02.943
Byron, get up! Come on! Go!

06:07.331 --> 06:09.032
It's cold.

06:13.837 --> 06:17.223
I'm telling you now, Byron,
I'm not doing your part!

06:17.224 --> 06:18.975
You better do it and I'm
not playing, either.

06:18.976 --> 06:20.009
Shut up, punk.

06:20.010 --> 06:23.011
I'm serious, Byron, and I'm
only doing half the windshield.

06:23.012 --> 06:25.096
I don't care what you do to me.
Shut your stupid mouth!

06:25.097 --> 06:27.800
I got something more
important to do right now.

06:32.354 --> 06:34.856
You know what, square?
I must be adopted.

06:34.857 --> 06:37.860
Because there ain't no way two folks
as ugly as your momma and daddy...

06:37.861 --> 06:42.064
could give birth to someone
as sharp as me. Look at that.

06:42.865 --> 06:46.451
Forget you.
Maybe you are a Hambone!

06:49.505 --> 06:54.591
You're not tricking me again!
Hitting me with all those snowballs.

06:54.592 --> 06:57.344
And in front of Buphead, too.

06:57.345 --> 06:59.046
Not right.

06:59.347 --> 07:02.249
Kenny, Kenny, help, help!

07:02.550 --> 07:06.053
Kenny! Kenny!
Help me, help me!

07:08.439 --> 07:10.139
Help me!

07:10.440 --> 07:12.859
I'm not playing, Byron!
I'm not that stupid.

07:12.860 --> 07:15.195
I'm serious, Kenny, go get help!
Go get momma!

07:15.196 --> 07:17.029
Why?

07:17.030 --> 07:19.115
Go get Momma, go get her, help!

07:19.116 --> 07:22.118
Momma! Come on, quick, it's By!

07:22.119 --> 07:25.120
Kenny Bernard Watson, what
is all that yelling about?

07:25.121 --> 07:27.206
- What on earth is going on?
- Quick! Quick! Hurry!

07:27.207 --> 07:28.207
Come on!

07:28.208 --> 07:31.126
Come on, I need help!
Geh me offa 'ere!

07:31.127 --> 07:33.161
Oh, my word.

07:33.162 --> 07:35.080
It's okay, sweetheart.

07:35.081 --> 07:36.130
How did this happen?

07:36.131 --> 07:38.999
Why you asking how it happened?
Can't you tell?

07:39.000 --> 07:42.170
This little knucklehead was kissing
his reflection in the window...

07:42.171 --> 07:44.005
and his lips got stuck.

07:44.006 --> 07:45.507
- Dad, help!
- Daniel, what are we gonna do?

07:45.508 --> 07:46.757
What do y'all do when
this happens up here?

07:46.758 --> 07:49.226
I don't know, I've lived in
Flint, Michigan my whole life...

07:49.227 --> 07:52.179
and I ain't never seen anyone with
their lips stuck to a window.

07:52.180 --> 07:54.180
I don't know what to
do, let him thaw out.

07:54.181 --> 07:55.266
Pull him off, Dad.

07:55.517 --> 07:56.850
No, no, no, no!

07:56.851 --> 07:59.852
What should we do? Should we pour
some hot water on the window...

07:59.853 --> 08:02.273
so it'll warm up and
we can pull him off?

08:02.274 --> 08:04.774
Byron, don't worry, baby.
We gonna get you off of here.

08:04.775 --> 08:07.111
I don't know, pouring hot water
on it might make it worse.

08:07.112 --> 08:11.281
But yeah, get some hot water out of
the tap and I'll see what I can do.

08:11.282 --> 08:12.865
Gimme this.

08:12.866 --> 08:14.367
Okay, lover boy...

08:17.254 --> 08:20.006
I guess you won't be getting
called hot lips, huh?

08:20.007 --> 08:22.090
The last of the red
hot lovers, either.

08:22.091 --> 08:24.711
Don't do that!
Oh, no, don't do that!

08:24.762 --> 08:26.546
No! Let me go!

08:27.348 --> 08:30.299
You better stop banging on this
brown bomber, boy, I ain't playing.

08:30.300 --> 08:32.668
Hey! Come here.

08:33.553 --> 08:36.255
Okay, come on, okay.

08:36.556 --> 08:39.258
It's okay, it's all right.
It's okay.

08:51.069 --> 08:52.653
Oh, no, 'top! 'top!

08:52.654 --> 08:54.155
Daniel, get in the house
and call the hospital...

08:54.156 --> 08:56.657
see what they say we should do.

08:56.658 --> 08:58.359
Joey and Kenny, go with your daddy!

08:58.627 --> 09:02.831
Okay, sweetheart, now you know
we're gonna have to do something.

09:03.081 --> 09:06.134
I'm just gonna warm up your
face a little bit, okay?

09:06.135 --> 09:09.337
All right, just relax, just relax.

09:09.338 --> 09:11.921
Okay, now you know I love you...

09:11.922 --> 09:15.125
and I wouldn't do anything
to hurt you, right?

09:15.426 --> 09:17.928
- Right? Okay.
- Wait, what are you gonna do?

09:17.929 --> 09:21.131
All right, it's okay.
It's okay, baby.

09:21.432 --> 09:25.135
No, no, can't... can't
hurt my mouth! Oh! No!

09:26.020 --> 09:28.055
No, no! No! Come on!
Get off me!

09:28.939 --> 09:30.272
Yee-ow!

09:31.574 --> 09:34.575
I didn't see it, but I bet
Byron's lips stretched a mile...

09:34.576 --> 09:36.078
before he let go of that window.

09:36.079 --> 09:41.484
I bet his lips looked like a giant rubber band
before they snapped away from that glass.

09:42.285 --> 09:44.420
- Hey, Joey, guess what?
- What?

09:44.421 --> 09:45.953
When I get to Aunt Cydney's...

09:45.954 --> 09:48.040
I'm going to start writing
my own comic book.

09:48.041 --> 09:49.458
About what?

09:49.459 --> 09:52.427
Well, it's going to be about
this really mean criminal...

09:52.428 --> 09:55.429
who has a terrible accident that
turns him into a superhero.

09:55.430 --> 09:57.015
Do you know what I'm gonna
call that superhero?

09:57.016 --> 09:58.466
Mm-mm.

09:58.467 --> 10:01.086
The Lipless Wonder.

10:02.354 --> 10:05.807
All he does is beat up other superheroes
who are smaller than him...

10:05.808 --> 10:09.511
and the only thing he's afraid of...
is a cold window.

10:10.728 --> 10:13.263
You wait, I'm gonna kick
your little behind!

10:14.482 --> 10:17.451
As the weather warmed up, Byron
and his friend Buphead...

10:17.452 --> 10:20.319
were happy to be on the streets
after being cooped up inside.

10:20.320 --> 10:24.291
We all were, but Byron and
Buphead together were dangerous.

10:24.292 --> 10:26.777
There's a problem?

10:27.578 --> 10:28.879
What up, punk?

10:28.880 --> 10:32.048
You want to learn something that
may save your stupid life one day?

10:32.049 --> 10:34.133
Er, uh, no.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.419
No? Well, we're gonna
teach you anyway.

10:36.420 --> 10:38.788
Yeah, this is called how
to survive a tornado.

10:43.927 --> 10:46.896
Byron, why would you do that?

10:46.897 --> 10:49.482
Are you okay, Kenny?

10:49.483 --> 10:51.766
I'm fine, get on the bus.

10:51.767 --> 10:53.401
Give my regards to
Clark, Poindexter.

10:53.402 --> 10:54.603
You're not going to school?

10:54.604 --> 10:57.489
School is for punks.

10:57.490 --> 11:00.192
The only thing worse than
when Buphead and Byron...

11:00.276 --> 11:02.576
were around, was when they weren't.

11:02.577 --> 11:05.581
It was like an open season on me
for the other kids to jump me.

11:05.582 --> 11:08.733
Poindexter the punk.

11:11.586 --> 11:14.671
Sometimes when Byron
tried to cut class...

11:14.672 --> 11:16.623
he got busted and
dragged to school.

11:16.624 --> 11:19.960
On those days, it was
particularly rough on me.

11:19.961 --> 11:21.745
Like it was my fault.

11:27.302 --> 11:29.302
I've stressed on
numerous occasions...

11:29.303 --> 11:31.686
the importance of being
familiar with literature.

11:31.687 --> 11:36.609
And I want to remind you of the vital
importance of being able to read well...

11:36.610 --> 11:40.563
and to be able to present
yourselves well in public...

11:40.564 --> 11:42.030
with the highest of standards.

11:42.031 --> 11:47.404
Today I want to give you a demonstration
of your own possibilities in this regard.

11:47.405 --> 11:51.456
I want you to know we
can be outstanding.

11:51.457 --> 11:55.577
Kenneth Watson?
Come on in here.

11:56.963 --> 12:01.633
Respect your fellow students.
Go on, son, show them how it's done.

12:01.634 --> 12:06.138
Because I liked to read, I was a
target for torture and ridicule.

12:06.139 --> 12:09.641
I was so nervous, I couldn't
even open up my book.

12:09.642 --> 12:12.426
Good thing I didn't need it.

12:14.229 --> 12:19.801
This is a poem written by
Langston Hughes in 1935.

12:21.603 --> 12:25.322
Let America Be America Again.

12:25.323 --> 12:30.410
Let America be America again.

12:30.411 --> 12:34.614
Let it be the dream it used to be.

12:34.615 --> 12:39.202
I am the young man full
of strength and hope...

12:39.203 --> 12:44.207
tangled in that ancient,
endless chain of profit...

12:44.208 --> 12:48.011
power, gain of grab the land.

12:48.012 --> 12:52.598
We the people must redeem
the land, the mines...

12:52.599 --> 12:54.601
the plants, the rivers,
the mountains.

12:54.602 --> 12:58.103
An endless plain, all...

12:58.104 --> 13:01.807
all the stretch of these
great, green states.

13:03.610 --> 13:07.814
And make America... America.

13:09.115 --> 13:10.515
Again.

13:15.320 --> 13:18.773
Bravo. Outstanding, Mr. Watson.

13:19.541 --> 13:21.042
Here that little egg head punk is.

13:21.043 --> 13:23.044
Leave the little clown alone.

13:23.045 --> 13:25.662
It's a crying shame, takin' him
around like a circus freak.

13:25.663 --> 13:28.449
Look, at least you oughtta make
them pay you for doing that mess.

13:28.550 --> 13:30.332
If it was me, they'd be
coming out their pockets...

13:30.333 --> 13:33.553
with some serious folding money
every time they took me around.

13:33.554 --> 13:36.557
I figured they were going to
tease me or beat me up...

13:36.558 --> 13:39.559
but just like that,
Byron saved my neck.

13:39.560 --> 13:41.061
He could be like that sometimes.

13:41.062 --> 13:44.515
You just never knew which
Byron you were gonna get.

13:45.900 --> 13:49.401
Byron, do you really think the
genie behind the couch...

13:49.402 --> 13:50.853
is gonna fix my doll's arm?

13:50.854 --> 13:53.321
I told you, he will fix it.
Just give it time.

13:53.322 --> 13:54.807
Leave it back there overnight
and see what happens.

13:55.108 --> 13:58.611
Don't believe him, Joey.
He's just making this all up.

13:58.612 --> 14:00.278
Hmm, that's what he's saying now...

14:00.279 --> 14:02.580
but, Joey, remember when Kenny
had that big math test?

14:02.581 --> 14:06.118
- He went behind the sofa to study
and guess what grade he got?
- What?

14:06.119 --> 14:07.836
- An A.
- Really, Kenny?

14:07.837 --> 14:10.338
Byron is the one who made us
believe in magic powers...

14:10.339 --> 14:12.839
that genies and angels
lived behind the couch.

14:12.840 --> 14:15.842
I wasn't sure if I believed,
but just in case...

14:15.843 --> 14:17.846
sometimes I studied back
there for reinforcement.

14:17.847 --> 14:19.180
Yeah, yeah.

14:19.181 --> 14:22.767
Byron, I want you and Kenny to go up
to Mitchell's and get some milk...

14:22.768 --> 14:25.971
a loaf of bread, and a small can
of tomato paste for dinner.

14:26.055 --> 14:27.689
Why can't Kenny go by himself?

14:27.690 --> 14:32.025
Byron, I want some milk,
a loaf of bread...

14:32.026 --> 14:33.809
and a small can of tomato paste.

14:33.810 --> 14:35.861
On Thursday, the Negroes
gave vivid evidence...

14:35.862 --> 14:40.267
that they would no longer tolerate
the patterns of the last 100 years.

14:40.618 --> 14:43.452
The crowd surged into downtown
and outside the south...

14:43.453 --> 14:47.107
voices were roused to ask why the
federal government was not involved.

14:49.711 --> 14:52.295
You shouldn't watch that in
front of Kenny and Joetta.

14:52.296 --> 14:54.797
Yeah, I understand, grown-ups only.

14:54.798 --> 14:56.783
Oh, Byron, please don't start.

15:12.982 --> 15:15.899
After Byron got busted
stealing from Mitchell's...

15:15.900 --> 15:18.403
he wasn't supposed to be
outside of the house at all.

15:18.404 --> 15:20.739
It was like he
couldn't help himself.

15:20.740 --> 15:22.191
He couldn't stay out of trouble.

15:22.192 --> 15:24.609
He kept digging deeper and deeper.

15:24.610 --> 15:26.812
Byron was out of control.

15:42.844 --> 15:44.261
Action!

15:44.262 --> 15:46.847
Enemy parachutes attack America...

15:46.848 --> 15:51.968
shot down over Flint River by Captain Byron
Watson and his flamethrower of death.

15:51.969 --> 15:53.803
Take six.

15:54.104 --> 15:58.841
Ja wohl, mein Fuhrer!
Auf wiedersehen!

16:02.646 --> 16:05.699
Such a brave soldier
deserves our respect...

16:05.700 --> 16:08.768
so we give him a burial at sea.

16:16.576 --> 16:19.111
Momma, I...

16:24.000 --> 16:26.001
Come here.

16:27.086 --> 16:32.089
Didn't I tell you, Byron?
I told you... one more time.

16:32.090 --> 16:34.091
One more time!

16:34.092 --> 16:36.811
If I found you burning matches
in this house one more time...

16:36.812 --> 16:40.682
putting this family in danger,
I was gonna wear you out...

16:40.766 --> 16:43.983
and this time, I am going to do it!
You have left me no choice.

16:43.984 --> 16:45.719
Momma, please don't do it!

16:45.937 --> 16:48.022
He won't do it again,
will you, Byron?

16:48.023 --> 16:49.691
- Promise her!
- Joetta, move! Move!

16:49.741 --> 16:51.525
Promise Momma you
won't do it again!

16:51.526 --> 16:55.945
He needs to learn a
very important lesson.

16:57.665 --> 17:00.667
No! No!

17:00.668 --> 17:01.584
Come here.

17:01.585 --> 17:04.871
And what are you doing with
a hat on in this house?

17:04.872 --> 17:06.790
Take it off!

17:06.790 --> 17:09.376
- Momma, I...
- Right now!

17:19.219 --> 17:21.553
What have you done?

17:21.554 --> 17:22.972
Byron had gotten a conk...

17:22.973 --> 17:26.642
a process, a doo, a
butter, a ton of trouble.

17:26.643 --> 17:28.643
Byron, run and get out of here!

17:28.644 --> 17:30.896
- Can't you see she's not playing?
- Joetta, move away from him!

17:30.897 --> 17:32.480
Momma! No!

17:32.564 --> 17:37.351
Hey! Hey!
What is going on?

17:37.953 --> 17:38.820
Oh, man!

17:38.821 --> 17:41.122
Hold your head still, boy.

17:41.123 --> 17:42.991
Take off one of those
ears by mistake.

17:42.992 --> 17:46.994
Kenny, what are you doing?

17:46.995 --> 17:48.880
Uh, nothing, Momma.

17:48.881 --> 17:50.831
What's your daddy doing?

17:50.832 --> 17:55.752
He's whistling... and
cutting off Byron's hair.

17:55.753 --> 17:59.222
Come on with me and
leave them alone.

17:59.223 --> 18:01.425
Yes, Momma.

18:04.228 --> 18:04.895
The genie did it.

18:04.896 --> 18:06.979
The genie did it,
that's pretty amazing.

18:06.980 --> 18:10.183
- Ow!
- Cut it out, it's just a little aftershave.

18:11.985 --> 18:16.856
Mrs. Watson, I would like to introduce
you to your long-lost son from Siam...

18:16.857 --> 18:21.061
his royal highness, Yule Watson.

18:26.750 --> 18:32.253
And Mrs. Watson, you can't possibly
deny that this is your child...

18:32.254 --> 18:34.256
because as you can see, he has
a lot of Sands blood in him...

18:34.257 --> 18:37.542
look at these ears.

18:37.543 --> 18:40.128
Don't try to blame that
on my side of the family.

18:40.129 --> 18:42.097
Someone switched this
child at the hospital.

18:42.098 --> 18:45.133
Hmm, come on.

18:45.134 --> 18:50.137
Hey! I can't believe you, my son...

18:50.138 --> 18:52.723
would want to walk around
looking like some pimp...

18:52.724 --> 18:56.227
or hustler or white boy,
none of which you are.

18:56.277 --> 18:59.363
So you go, you get the
broom, the dustpan...

18:59.364 --> 19:00.863
you clean that bathroom out...

19:00.864 --> 19:03.567
and you go in your room
and stay in your room.

19:03.868 --> 19:05.788
You're old enough now,
you been told enough.

19:05.870 --> 19:09.073
Now we gotta do something
about it! Beat it!

19:15.379 --> 19:17.213
She's a tough, old lady...

19:17.214 --> 19:19.049
but why does she think she
gotta yell into the phone...

19:19.050 --> 19:21.751
every time we talk long distance?

19:21.752 --> 19:23.719
Give me this.

19:23.720 --> 19:26.539
Okay, Momma, we'll be
getting back to you.

19:26.924 --> 19:29.626
I love you.
Bye bye.

19:34.847 --> 19:36.348
I don't know why we
didn't catch on...

19:36.349 --> 19:39.350
that something different was
really going to happen this time.

19:39.351 --> 19:43.354
Momma and Dad started acting real strange
right after they talked to Grandma Sands.

19:43.355 --> 19:44.857
Come on, everybody!
Everybody, all right, now!

19:44.858 --> 19:47.359
Here we go! Come on!

19:47.360 --> 19:52.564
Lean in here. Come on,
Byron, what do you think?

19:53.365 --> 19:55.367
Well, what on earth is
that towel doing there?

19:55.368 --> 19:58.035
Kenny, do the honors.

19:58.036 --> 20:03.591
Ladies and gentlemen, introducing the
newest addition to the Brown Bomber.

20:03.592 --> 20:06.260
Our very own...

20:06.261 --> 20:08.796
drive around record player!

20:09.464 --> 20:10.713
Oh, boy!

20:10.714 --> 20:14.384
Oh, man, this is too, too hip!
No one's got one of these.

20:14.385 --> 20:16.387
Speedy don't even have one
in his Cadillac, man.

20:16.388 --> 20:18.271
Too much, way too much!

20:18.272 --> 20:19.856
Turn it on, Dad!

20:19.857 --> 20:24.359
Well, well, well, I see that you
three have the ultimate in taste.

20:24.360 --> 20:27.364
I see you have chosen a
top-of-the-line, the cream-of-the-crop.

20:27.365 --> 20:33.285
The Truetone AB-700
model, the Ultra Glide.

20:33.286 --> 20:38.374
And, as I'm sure such a fine and
intelligent-looking family such as this...

20:38.375 --> 20:42.294
it is Mr. and Mrs. Watson, yes?

20:42.295 --> 20:44.297
And this is your son, isn't it?

20:44.298 --> 20:46.798
Oh, no, this isn't our son...

20:46.799 --> 20:50.051
this is just a little juvenile
delinquent boy that we feel sorry for...

20:50.052 --> 20:52.337
and let us follow us
around some of the time.

20:52.338 --> 20:54.372
Our real son has hair.

20:55.757 --> 20:56.841
Hey, hey, hey!

20:56.842 --> 20:59.627
Please, Mrs. Watson, can you
control this little delinquent...

20:59.811 --> 21:01.227
that follows you
around all the time?

21:01.228 --> 21:04.232
Because if I see him over there playing
with the knobs on that record player...

21:04.233 --> 21:07.935
I might just pull his
fingers off his hand.

21:07.936 --> 21:10.520
Well, well, well!

21:10.521 --> 21:18.161
I see you have such a
beautiful, young daughter.

21:18.162 --> 21:20.580
Oh, yes, we are very proud.

21:20.581 --> 21:21.665
Oh!

21:21.666 --> 21:23.034
Daniel, go on and
start that record.

21:23.035 --> 21:24.151
All right.

21:49.192 --> 21:52.276
Did you tell them yet?

21:52.277 --> 21:54.062
No, it can wait.

21:54.063 --> 21:55.564
No, it can't.

21:56.782 --> 21:59.117
Uh-oh, this sounded like the
way Byron and I found out...

21:59.118 --> 22:00.602
we were going to have a sister.

22:04.656 --> 22:10.160
Children, in a few days, your daddy's
gonna get some vacation time...

22:10.161 --> 22:13.163
and we're gonna drive
to Birmingham.

22:13.164 --> 22:18.169
Now y'all know I haven't been back home in a
while, and it's time for us to see our family.

22:18.170 --> 22:22.139
And for you to get to
know your southern roots.

22:22.140 --> 22:26.175
Now when we get there, your daddy will stay for
a few days and we will stay for the summer.

22:26.176 --> 22:28.929
Yeah, that's why I bought the Ultra
Glide, because we have a long trip.

22:28.930 --> 22:31.479
It's 15 hours down there and
once we get around Cincinnati...

22:31.480 --> 22:34.183
ain't nothing but hillbilly
music gonna be playing.

22:34.184 --> 22:36.186
And depending on how things go...

22:36.187 --> 22:40.272
Byron may stay with Grandma
Sands for the school year.

22:40.273 --> 22:44.360
Yeah, you know I didn't want to condemn you
to stay with Grandma Sands like that...

22:44.361 --> 22:46.244
but you left us no other choice.

22:46.245 --> 22:48.164
We had heard so many
horrible stories...

22:48.165 --> 22:50.164
about how strict Grandma Sands was.

22:50.165 --> 22:51.165
The thought of living with
her was so terrible...

22:51.166 --> 22:54.453
that your brain would throw
it out as soon as it came in.

22:54.454 --> 22:56.755
We've been telling you, Byron.

22:56.756 --> 22:59.089
You've been given
warning after warning.

22:59.090 --> 23:01.877
But instead of improving,
you're getting worse.

23:01.878 --> 23:06.881
You've cut school so much, Mr. Williams
has been by here three times...

23:06.882 --> 23:08.383
to see what's wrong with you.

23:08.384 --> 23:11.935
You've been lighting fires,
you've been fighting.

23:11.936 --> 23:14.638
You stole from the
Mitchell Food Fair.

23:14.639 --> 23:18.725
You set mouse traps in the
backyard for the birds.

23:18.726 --> 23:21.228
That's just too much, Byron.

23:21.229 --> 23:24.231
We can't have all that
nonsense going on.

23:24.232 --> 23:27.951
Now I never thought I'd say it...

23:27.952 --> 23:31.404
but maybe a dose of Birmingham will
help you get your priorities straight.

23:31.405 --> 23:37.160
And best of all,
there is no Buphead.

23:38.245 --> 23:39.946
Hey!

23:40.214 --> 23:44.000
No, no, let him go, Daniel.

23:44.001 --> 23:47.454
He better get as much of this
nonsense out of his system as he can.

23:50.339 --> 23:53.842
The University of Alabama Tuscaloosa
campus is on tight security guard...

23:53.843 --> 23:57.845
as Governor Wallace appeals for
calm as he stands in the doorway...

23:57.846 --> 24:01.849
to prevent two Negro students from
registering at the University.

24:01.850 --> 24:04.353
He made a campaign promise
to prevent integration...

24:04.354 --> 24:07.189
of the last all-white
state university.

24:07.190 --> 24:11.275
And I say segregation now,
segregation tomorrow...

24:11.276 --> 24:13.944
and segregation forever.

24:13.945 --> 24:16.030
- Momma?
- Hm.

24:16.031 --> 24:18.233
Is that where we're going?

24:19.534 --> 24:22.536
Go on to your room, Kenny.

24:22.537 --> 24:25.039
Don't you worry about that.

24:25.040 --> 24:27.208
Go on, baby.

24:29.044 --> 24:30.008
It's a tough break, man.

24:30.009 --> 24:32.429
You couldn't figure
your way out, huh?

24:32.430 --> 24:37.934
And dang, down south, you gonna
come back all countrified.

24:37.935 --> 24:40.720
No, I'm not. That old bag
can't do nothing to me.

24:41.021 --> 24:45.358
You watch, when we ride in that stupid car,
I'm not gonna say one word the whole way.

24:45.359 --> 24:46.693
That's a long ride.

24:46.694 --> 24:51.196
That's right, I'm not gonna talk.
It'll drive them crazy.

24:51.197 --> 24:55.984
Well, listen, I got room on the floor
in my bedroom if you need it, man.

24:57.287 --> 25:01.039
That might work.
Tonight, after lights out.

25:01.040 --> 25:03.208
I'll be up waiting for you.

25:03.209 --> 25:07.162
That's it. Thanks, man.

25:07.163 --> 25:08.664
What would I do without you?

25:08.665 --> 25:11.833
I keep asking myself
that same question.

25:17.472 --> 25:19.173
Bye, Mrs. Watson, bye, Joey.

25:19.474 --> 25:21.175
Goodbye, Stewart.

25:21.977 --> 25:25.061
Well, I didn't want to keep you, I
just wanted to give Joey this angel.

25:25.062 --> 25:29.848
She's been so wonderful in Sunday School,
and she's just an angel herself.

25:29.849 --> 25:33.019
See, Wilona, didn't I tell you
she looked just like Joey?

25:33.020 --> 25:34.804
Look at that smile.

25:37.325 --> 25:39.894
Let me see that.

25:40.695 --> 25:43.529
The only thing about its smile
that looked like Joey to me...

25:43.530 --> 25:46.984
was that the angel had a little
dimple on her right cheek, too.

25:48.869 --> 25:50.786
Thank you, Mrs. Davidson.

25:50.787 --> 25:54.457
You're welcome, child.
We'll miss you in Sunday School.

25:54.458 --> 25:56.659
Let me walk you out.

26:00.130 --> 26:02.097
Joey, what's wrong?

26:02.098 --> 26:05.134
That doll doesn't
look at all like me.

26:05.135 --> 26:08.938
Well, I can see how it
might remind her of you.

26:08.939 --> 26:10.388
Look at that dimple.

26:10.389 --> 26:12.190
She's white.

26:12.191 --> 26:18.229
Well, I can't say she isn't,
but an angel's an angel.

26:18.230 --> 26:20.114
What do you think?

26:20.115 --> 26:25.820
Maybe, but I know that angel's
name is not Joetta Watson.

26:29.124 --> 26:30.707
Lights out, Kenny.

26:30.708 --> 26:32.709
Byron, you come with us.

26:32.710 --> 26:34.194
What for?

26:35.046 --> 26:36.078
Oh, we thought since this is your
last night in Flint for a while...

26:36.079 --> 26:38.298
you might like to
spend it in our room.

26:38.299 --> 26:40.667
You thought what?

26:40.668 --> 26:43.920
Come on, By, you're
bunking with us.

26:43.921 --> 26:45.672
Man!

26:48.309 --> 26:50.209
It wasn't me.

26:52.512 --> 26:53.980
- Come on, go get him, Kenny.
- Okay.

26:53.981 --> 26:55.015
We gotta get on the road right now.

26:55.016 --> 26:56.482
Come on, guys!

26:56.483 --> 27:00.019
Come on, Byron, what you doing?
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

27:00.020 --> 27:04.190
Baby girl, come, come, come.
Let your little sister in there.

27:06.243 --> 27:07.744
I got you, baby. Here we go.

27:07.745 --> 27:09.445
Thank you.

27:29.048 --> 27:30.214
Okay, listen up.

27:30.215 --> 27:33.600
Day One, today, we
left at 5:00 AM...

27:33.601 --> 27:36.937
so by the time we get to Tennessee, the
sun'll be up and we can travel in daylight.

27:36.938 --> 27:38.439
Travel in daylight?

27:38.440 --> 27:43.359
Just to be safe. Travelling in the daylight
in the south is what's best for us.

27:43.360 --> 27:46.397
We'll drive for six more hours, and
that should get us to Cincinnati.

27:46.481 --> 27:48.983
Mr. Johnson says there's
some clean rest stops there.

27:48.984 --> 27:51.868
Hey, Momma, can I see your journal?

27:51.869 --> 27:53.570
Mm-hm.

27:54.872 --> 27:57.074
Why is that bird trying
to land on a flower?

27:58.375 --> 28:01.077
That's exactly what I said, but
then she got highly offended.

28:01.328 --> 28:05.949
You all just do not know good art,
that is not a bird, it is a bee.

28:06.083 --> 28:10.052
Well, maybe if I scrunch
my eyes real tight.

28:10.053 --> 28:11.136
Scrunch.

28:11.137 --> 28:13.137
Anything else I can get you folks?

28:13.138 --> 28:13.754
No, thank you, we gotta
get on the road.

28:13.755 --> 28:14.840
Where are you headed?

28:14.841 --> 28:16.341
Down to Alabama.

28:16.342 --> 28:19.845
Wow, that is a long ride.

28:19.846 --> 28:21.762
Well, you all be
careful, all right?

28:21.763 --> 28:23.649
- We will, thank you.
- Thank you.

28:23.650 --> 28:25.350
Thank you.

28:25.518 --> 28:28.103
Let's go.

28:56.597 --> 28:57.764
How we gonna work
this record player?

28:57.765 --> 28:58.715
What do you mean?

28:58.716 --> 29:00.132
We're gonna take turns?

29:00.133 --> 29:02.184
Well, we won't be playing
it for quite a bit yet...

29:02.185 --> 29:04.805
because we can carry WKBO all
the way down into Ohio...

29:05.106 --> 29:06.438
and they play pretty good music.

29:06.439 --> 29:08.442
But when we do play it,
we're gonna take turns?

29:08.443 --> 29:10.010
Sure.

29:10.226 --> 29:13.028
Cool. I'm first?

29:13.029 --> 29:16.648
Sure, okay.
We'll go by seniority.

29:16.649 --> 29:17.983
Cool.

29:19.619 --> 29:21.402
Guess you showed them, didn't you?

29:21.403 --> 29:24.039
Boy, they are begging you to
talk, weren't they, Daddio?

29:24.040 --> 29:27.409
- You little...
- I guess being a lipless wonder
can't stop you from talking.

29:27.961 --> 29:30.495
Stop! Stop!
Stop it!

29:30.496 --> 29:34.715
Hey! Hey! I said no nonsense
and I don't mean maybe.

29:34.716 --> 29:36.167
President Kennedy submitted...

29:36.168 --> 29:38.636
Jack you up in Alabama, punk!

29:38.637 --> 29:42.257
Ssh, ssh. Daniel, turn that up.
What'd they say?

29:42.508 --> 29:44.057
to desegregate schools...

29:44.058 --> 29:49.813
allow federal programs to be cut off in any
area where discrimination was practiced.

29:49.814 --> 29:52.431
And establish a community
relations service...

29:52.432 --> 29:55.519
to help local communities
to resolve racial disputes.

29:55.903 --> 29:58.572
The bill is expected to
be voted on this fall.

29:58.573 --> 30:02.226
And in other news,
yesterday in Birmingham...

30:03.027 --> 30:06.813
there was another bombing in
the North Smithfield section.

30:39.612 --> 30:41.814
Time to use the bathroom.

30:51.539 --> 30:53.824
Byron, help Joey put her shoe on.

31:07.472 --> 31:09.040
Oh, nasty.

31:18.181 --> 31:19.265
What's the word on them toilets?

31:19.266 --> 31:21.267
Oh, you like those, huh?

31:21.268 --> 31:23.268
You better get used
to those, Byron.

31:23.269 --> 31:26.273
That's called an outhouse, and
that's what Grandma Sands has.

31:26.274 --> 31:26.974
What?

31:28.275 --> 31:30.157
Uh-huh, that's where you gonna be taking
care of your business for a while, boy.

31:30.158 --> 31:31.777
Wait, let me dig this.

31:32.078 --> 31:34.078
You mean if I gotta use the
bathroom, I gotta go outside?

31:34.079 --> 31:35.781
Into a little, nasty
thing like that?

31:36.165 --> 31:39.201
Well, ain't they got no
sanitation laws down there?

31:39.502 --> 31:42.003
How you gonna have a hole for a
toilet and not get folks sick?

31:42.004 --> 31:44.422
Don't them things attract flies?

31:44.423 --> 31:46.875
Oh, I remember those outhouses.

31:46.876 --> 31:49.176
We used to go visit my
grandma in the country...

31:49.177 --> 31:52.263
and she used to keep a
catalog inside the outhouse.

31:52.264 --> 31:55.214
So when you were done, you
know, doing your business...

31:55.215 --> 31:57.218
you had to rip off a
page from the catalog.

31:57.219 --> 31:59.136
We get the picture, Daniel.

31:59.137 --> 32:02.340
You had to do it, man.
You had to do it.

32:07.279 --> 32:09.564
Dad, now can we play
my favorite song?

32:09.698 --> 32:16.520
Now, just for Kenny Watson of the famous
Watson's, I'll play his favorite song.

32:18.906 --> 32:21.408
All right.

32:23.243 --> 32:26.245
You can run like a rabbit
Fly like a bee

32:26.246 --> 32:28.631
No matter what you do
You'll never get away from me

32:28.632 --> 32:34.169
Because I'm right behind you
Baby right behind you baby

32:34.170 --> 32:38.674
I'm right behind you baby and
You'll never get away from me

32:39.926 --> 32:42.176
You can make up your face
Dye your hair

32:42.177 --> 32:45.264
No matter what you do
Turn around I'll be there

32:45.265 --> 32:50.434
I'm right behind you baby
I'm right behind you baby

32:50.435 --> 32:52.470
Well I'm right behind you baby

32:58.527 --> 33:00.946
Dad, do you know what
you're listening to?

33:00.947 --> 33:04.281
Kenneth, you know
I've been thinking.

33:04.282 --> 33:07.251
I've been thinking about changing
all our names to country names...

33:07.252 --> 33:08.169
when we go back to Michigan.

33:08.170 --> 33:14.124
So, I'll be Clem. You'll be Homer.

33:14.125 --> 33:18.679
And you know, Joey, you have to have a
cute name, your name will be Daisy May.

33:18.680 --> 33:21.715
And you, you'll be Billy Bob.

33:21.849 --> 33:25.802
And your mother, well, uh, your
mother's name can just stay Wilona...

33:25.803 --> 33:31.473
because I don't believe we could find a
more country name than that if we tried.

33:31.474 --> 33:37.696
Yes, well, I hope you can make sure
and get us the whole ways home, Clem.

33:37.697 --> 33:42.101
Elsin' we'll be some
pitiful folks sho nuff'.

33:44.788 --> 33:46.905
Uh-uh, uh-uh.

33:46.906 --> 33:49.458
Civil rights leader Medgar
Evers was gunned down today...

33:49.459 --> 33:52.160
outside his home in
Jackson, Mississippi.

33:52.461 --> 33:55.714
In his arms was a stack of sweatshirts
that read, Jim Crow must go.

33:55.715 --> 33:57.548
What?

33:57.549 --> 33:59.000
My word.

33:59.001 --> 34:04.756
In 1954, Evers wrote an article
called, "Why I Love Mississippi".

34:05.057 --> 34:07.508
Here is an excerpt.

34:07.509 --> 34:13.013
It may sound funny, but I love the south.
I don't choose to live any where else.

34:13.014 --> 34:18.185
There's land here where a man can raise
cattle and I'm going to do that some day.

34:18.186 --> 34:21.856
There are lakes where a man can
sink a hook and fight bass.

34:21.857 --> 34:25.942
There is room here for my
children to play, and grow...

34:25.943 --> 34:30.446
and become good citizens, if
the white man will let them.

34:59.191 --> 35:00.558
Whoo!

35:00.559 --> 35:02.444
When we finally arrived
in Birmingham...

35:02.445 --> 35:04.945
it didn't seem so different
from Flint after all.

35:04.946 --> 35:08.900
There were no outhouses, but I would soon
learn that when you looked a little closer...

35:08.901 --> 35:11.402
it was like you were
in a different world.

35:11.403 --> 35:15.606
Whoo! Babies, we home!
We home!

35:26.334 --> 35:27.968
Oh, you look so good.

35:27.969 --> 35:28.969
You do, too!

35:28.970 --> 35:33.005
Really? Y'all come over here
and give your grandma a hug.

35:33.006 --> 35:34.707
Oh!

35:36.009 --> 35:41.214
Kenneth Bernard Watson, you best acting
so silly. Give Grandma a good hug!

35:44.151 --> 35:45.651
Whoa.

35:45.652 --> 35:48.521
It's so nice to see you,
Grandma Sands.

35:48.522 --> 35:52.908
Oh, 'Lona, look at this child!

35:52.909 --> 35:56.995
If this ain't you!
Look at this baby!

35:56.996 --> 36:00.949
Just as pretty and sweet
as you want to be.

36:18.383 --> 36:22.086
Oh, you calling this a bad child?

36:22.387 --> 36:26.307
This little saint's about ready to go
back north, go to Sunday School...

36:26.308 --> 36:29.427
go home and scrub all
the floors, aren't you?

36:29.644 --> 36:30.927
Yes, ma'am.

36:31.228 --> 36:34.447
Oh, you grew up to be
a fine looking boy.

36:34.448 --> 36:40.620
You was so puny when you was born, you
nearly worried us crazy. Now look at you!

36:40.621 --> 36:44.207
Strapping man!

36:44.208 --> 36:47.794
Oh, we gonna get on just fine.
What you think, By?

36:47.795 --> 36:49.295
Yes, ma'am.

36:49.296 --> 36:55.584
My family, my beautiful,
beautiful family!

36:55.585 --> 37:01.306
Oh, Wilona, family,
this is Mr. Robert.

37:01.307 --> 37:03.008
Hi, I heard...

37:03.309 --> 37:06.712
Y'all come on inside, let me
get you something to eat.

37:12.150 --> 37:15.886
What you staring at?

37:17.272 --> 37:19.274
What'd you expect?
We just got here.

37:19.275 --> 37:21.659
I gotta feel the old bird out.

37:21.660 --> 37:25.897
She probably got a weak heart or something.
I ain't gonna have her death on my hands.

37:29.201 --> 37:31.402
By, By, By.

37:40.595 --> 37:42.797
By?

37:49.553 --> 37:52.805
- Dad?
- Yeah.

37:57.611 --> 37:59.111
Good morning, Kenny.

37:59.112 --> 38:02.113
Morning, Dad, morning, By.
Morning, Mr. Robert.

38:02.114 --> 38:05.116
- Morning.
- Man, you gotta quit drinking so much water.

38:05.117 --> 38:06.619
He sweated up the
whole bed last night.

38:06.620 --> 38:11.622
I ain't sharing a bed with your leaky,
little b... your leaky, little self again.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.125
When y'all boys gonna
get used to the heat?

38:13.126 --> 38:15.126
So, is he too old to hunt?

38:15.127 --> 38:19.631
Well, he never was a good hunting
dog, but he's a great guard dog.

38:19.632 --> 38:22.633
Old Toddy'd give his life for
anybody under this roof.

38:22.634 --> 38:23.717
Should we be worried?

38:23.718 --> 38:27.923
Oh, no, just some folks want
to cause trouble, that's all.

38:28.223 --> 38:29.641
Uh, trouble?

38:29.642 --> 38:34.228
Well, since colored folks moved up here,
started building all these nice homes...

38:34.229 --> 38:36.563
some folks want to harass them.

38:36.564 --> 38:39.650
Now they gotta integrate all the
elementary schools in September...

38:39.651 --> 38:41.653
they trying to destroy
the whole neighborhood.

38:41.654 --> 38:44.655
Chase everybody away.

38:44.656 --> 38:47.156
But you ain't gotta
worry, we got Toddy.

38:47.157 --> 38:48.692
The mailman won't even
come near this house.

38:48.693 --> 38:53.029
He come up in the backyard
one day, Toddy tore him up!

38:53.914 --> 38:55.413
Nothing like a good dog.

38:55.414 --> 38:59.834
You see a little boy with a big
dog, that dog obey that little boy.

38:59.835 --> 39:01.337
You better not mess with him.

39:01.338 --> 39:04.339
Byron, Kenny, I'm gonna teach
you some of Toddy's tricks.

39:04.340 --> 39:07.342
And he gonna love playing with
you boys while you're here.

39:07.343 --> 39:08.259
When do we eat?

39:08.260 --> 39:11.212
When do we eat? You the only one
that hasn't eaten yet, Kenny.

39:11.213 --> 39:15.166
But Grandma and your mother's
in the kitchen, go eat.

39:15.468 --> 39:21.223
Watch this, Toddy, down! Toddy, down!
He thinking about it.

39:21.440 --> 39:24.025
Four hours... good morning, Kenny.

39:24.026 --> 39:26.028
Good morning, Momma.
Good morning, Joey.

39:26.029 --> 39:28.029
Good morning, Grandma Sands.

39:28.030 --> 39:29.231
You sleep all right?

39:29.232 --> 39:31.115
It was really hot.

39:31.116 --> 39:33.450
I know, I was sweating all night.

39:33.451 --> 39:36.987
Well, what about Calla Lilly Lincoln?
I always wondered what she's doing?

39:36.988 --> 39:38.871
'Lona, didn't I write
you about that?

39:38.872 --> 39:42.576
She and her family moved, too.
Lots of folks are leaving town.

39:43.378 --> 39:44.210
And what about you, Momma?

39:44.211 --> 39:47.081
You think you be all right
up here by yourself?

39:47.082 --> 39:49.382
Now you know you can
always move in with us.

39:49.383 --> 39:51.668
Child, you know I
ain't going nowhere.

39:51.669 --> 39:55.838
This is my home. Ain't nobody
gonna run me out of here.

39:55.839 --> 39:59.058
Plus, I got Robert to look after.

39:59.059 --> 40:01.060
Robert...

40:01.061 --> 40:07.267
Mr. Robert seems like a
nice enough man, but...

40:08.068 --> 40:10.185
I was wondering when we
was gonna get to that.

40:10.186 --> 40:16.274
Robert and I have been good friends
since right after y'all left for Flint.

40:16.275 --> 40:18.527
Good friends, but when
did he move in here?

40:18.528 --> 40:21.028
Wilona Sands, what is it
that's bothering you?

40:21.029 --> 40:23.030
Why don't you just say
what's on your mind?

40:23.031 --> 40:27.501
I just don't understand why you
never told me he was living here.

40:27.502 --> 40:29.121
I mean, where's his house?

40:29.122 --> 40:34.208
'Lona, things are different from
what they were when you left here.

40:34.209 --> 40:36.343
Everything is changing.

40:36.344 --> 40:42.666
Your daddy's been gone for almost 20 years
now and Robert is my dearest friend.

40:43.468 --> 40:45.469
I like having him around.

40:45.470 --> 40:50.273
He protects this house,
him and that dog.

40:50.274 --> 40:53.894
Mr. Robert's gonna show us around downtown,
and Joey and Kenny, you're coming.

40:54.195 --> 40:59.200
So, Kenny, finish up and go get dressed, and
leave these two alone, let them catch up.

40:59.201 --> 41:02.202
Hurry up, go, go, go!
Come on!

41:02.203 --> 41:04.905
This is good.
Y'all have a nice time now!

41:11.327 --> 41:12.828
It's just gonna take
me a little while.

41:12.829 --> 41:15.531
Oh, come on!

41:16.749 --> 41:19.835
Hey, what's that smell?

41:19.836 --> 41:24.840
Fried onions, burgers, hot
dogs and french fries.

41:24.841 --> 41:29.345
Hot dogs? Let's go!
They smell good.

41:38.987 --> 41:42.073
Hi, my family's right behind us, so
we should have five hot dogs, please.

41:42.074 --> 41:46.194
And can we have a side of french
fries with each hot dog? Thank you.

41:46.278 --> 41:48.446
Y'all aren't from
around here, are you?

41:48.447 --> 41:50.481
Was it my accent that gave me way?

41:51.115 --> 41:52.781
See, we don't serve your kind here.

41:52.782 --> 41:54.618
You're gonna have to go around
back to get something to eat.

41:54.619 --> 41:56.287
Now y'all better get on.

41:56.587 --> 41:57.587
What?

41:57.588 --> 42:00.173
Sorry, ma'am, these boys,
they're from Michigan.

42:00.174 --> 42:03.175
They don't know how we do things down
here in Birmingham. Come on, y'all.

42:03.176 --> 42:04.378
Why? I want a hot dog.

42:04.679 --> 42:06.931
Let's go, boy, you heard
Mr. Robert. Let's go, now!

42:06.932 --> 42:09.015
But she said go around back.

42:09.016 --> 42:11.717
I want a hot dog right here,
right now. What's the problem?

42:11.718 --> 42:14.520
Boy, you better get up off your seat.
We done told you nice. Now get out!

42:14.521 --> 42:18.057
Margaret, you don't need to talk to them
like that. They're not from around here.

42:18.058 --> 42:21.059
Please, outsiders come around
all the time startin' trouble.

42:21.060 --> 42:24.097
Now you go on before I have to call
the police and have you arrested.

42:24.197 --> 42:28.201
I was so confused. I couldn't
figure out why the lady was so mad.

42:28.202 --> 42:30.351
What did we do to her?

42:35.958 --> 42:37.442
Come on!

42:39.545 --> 42:42.130
Man, I'm going back there and I'm
throwing a rock through their window!

42:42.131 --> 42:44.131
If Buphead were down here,
we'd tear that store up!

42:44.132 --> 42:46.133
Byron! Violence is not the answer.

42:46.134 --> 42:47.136
I don't care, that was wrong!

42:47.137 --> 42:48.337
Well, you better care!

42:49.138 --> 42:51.637
This is for real down here and if you don't
follow the rules, you can get seriously hurt!

42:51.638 --> 42:55.342
So while we're down here,
follow the rules, period!

42:55.476 --> 42:57.843
And Kenny, you just need to know what
the rules are and you'll be okay.

42:57.844 --> 43:00.245
You just stay out of white
folks' way, you be all right.

43:00.348 --> 43:03.349
Man, how do I know if I'm in their way,
when I just wanted to buy a hot dog?

43:03.350 --> 43:04.852
Well, you'll get used to it.

43:04.853 --> 43:06.353
I don't think so.

43:06.354 --> 43:11.358
Mr. Robert, where can we go to fish and swim
and do something to pick up our spirits?

43:11.359 --> 43:14.561
Great minds think alike, Daniel.

43:19.199 --> 43:23.403
She was the prettiest little thing. She
just went screaming like a little pig.

43:24.204 --> 43:28.040
I thought they gave
me the wrong baby.

43:28.041 --> 43:31.626
Oh, here they are.
Did y'all have a good time?

43:31.627 --> 43:35.629
Uh, we had a little incident, but Mr. Robert
showed us where they fish and swim...

43:35.630 --> 43:38.133
- which seemed to help.
- An incident?

43:38.134 --> 43:41.101
Robert, you didn't take them down
to Collier's Landing, did you?

43:41.102 --> 43:45.807
Well, now, Gloria, you know I'm not gonna take
your grandkids anywhere near Collier's Landing.

43:46.108 --> 43:49.111
I know you'd never forgive me
if these kids was to get hurt.

43:49.112 --> 43:50.611
You got that right.

43:50.612 --> 43:56.317
Children, now you remember, stay
away from Collier's Landing.

43:56.618 --> 44:00.121
That whirlpool in that water
is dangerous, you hear me?

44:00.122 --> 44:02.406
What's a Wooh Pooh?

44:02.407 --> 44:04.959
Hi, Marlene, how are you?

44:04.960 --> 44:07.662
Children, come on over here
and say hi to your cousins.

44:07.796 --> 44:10.129
They've been waiting to meet you.

44:10.130 --> 44:11.331
Hi.

44:12.633 --> 44:17.838
Why don't y'all go play down by those swings
I had Robert put in before you got here.

44:20.507 --> 44:22.008
- What incident?
- Robert, what did you do?

44:22.009 --> 44:24.511
- Well, we were just walking.
- Down at that diner.

44:29.767 --> 44:32.267
What happened to your leg?

44:32.268 --> 44:35.220
Oh, I got hurt during the marches.

44:35.238 --> 44:38.323
You marched? I saw that on TV.

44:38.324 --> 44:39.323
What were you doing out there?

44:39.324 --> 44:42.494
We were fighting for an equal
education, an equal life.

44:42.495 --> 44:44.997
As Junior and Sarah were telling
us about how they marched...

44:44.998 --> 44:47.367
I could vividly picture
what they went through.

44:47.368 --> 44:54.121
Whoo! Good morning, boys and girls!
It's Pauly the "Catman" Carter on WENN.

44:54.122 --> 44:56.090
Make sure you grab
your toothbrush...

44:56.091 --> 44:58.091
head on down to the party
at Kelly Ingram Park.

44:58.092 --> 45:02.013
Why bring your toothbrush you ask?
Cuz lunch will be served!

45:02.014 --> 45:04.014
Hey, wait, I want to march, too.

45:04.015 --> 45:06.132
Let me go today, see how
everything turns out.

45:06.133 --> 45:09.337
You can go tomorrow if
everything goes okay.

45:19.563 --> 45:23.733
What in the world?

45:31.491 --> 45:36.496
Students! When I turn my back, for those of
you who want to leave, I won't stop you.

45:36.497 --> 45:40.049
And since I won't
see you walk out...

45:40.050 --> 45:44.621
I won't be able to mark you absent.

46:02.488 --> 46:05.238
Everybody was so excited
about the march...

46:05.239 --> 46:08.192
that we couldn't keep the
kids away, not even Sarah.

46:13.164 --> 46:15.649
All right, amen.

46:15.950 --> 46:22.122
As Dr. Martin Luther King
has said countless times.

46:22.123 --> 46:26.510
Non-violence is the
key in the fight...

46:26.511 --> 46:29.213
to break the bondage of oppression.

46:29.597 --> 46:31.080
Amen.

46:31.131 --> 46:37.520
In Birmingham, that oppression has
manifested a segregation in our schools...

46:37.521 --> 46:41.391
our stores and our lunch counters.

46:41.641 --> 46:46.278
And when the world sees
you walking in peace...

46:46.279 --> 46:50.565
praying for justice,
segregation will fall.

46:58.207 --> 47:04.329
When Birmingham becomes more equal, the
entire country becomes more equal.

47:04.330 --> 47:08.534
You have the power
to make that happen!

47:14.339 --> 47:18.476
Now when you exit the doors,
we will walk north of 6th Avenue...

47:18.477 --> 47:22.429
and you will go out
in groups of 50.

47:24.482 --> 47:30.019
Now the goal of this march
is to get arrested.

47:30.020 --> 47:36.576
Now when the police approach, you
go with him in peace, no violence.

47:36.577 --> 47:40.579
Our progress in gaining freedom
depends on your ability...

47:40.580 --> 47:43.081
to refrain from any
acts of violence.

47:43.082 --> 47:47.587
You must remove anything that might
appear to be a weapon. Switchblades...

47:47.588 --> 47:52.339
No knives, even a fancy comb or a nail
file could be considered a weapon.

47:52.340 --> 47:56.343
So be sure to throw it all here in
this barrel in front of the church.

47:56.344 --> 47:58.547
Are you ready to move for justice?

47:58.848 --> 48:00.348
Yeah!

48:00.349 --> 48:01.850
Let me hear you move for justice!

48:01.851 --> 48:05.637
All right, ain't gonna let
nobody turn me around!

48:05.638 --> 48:09.057
Turn me around! Turn me around!

48:09.058 --> 48:12.726
Ain't gonna let nobody
turn me around!

48:12.727 --> 48:16.313
Turn me around!
Turn me around!

48:16.314 --> 48:21.235
Ain't gonna let nobody turn me around!
I'm gonna keep on walking.

48:21.236 --> 48:22.736
Thank you, darling.

48:22.737 --> 48:25.489
My brother!
Thank you, brother!

48:25.490 --> 48:30.026
Now! Right now, my brothers and sisters!
Now we're ready.

48:30.211 --> 48:32.580
I couldn't believe
these were my cousins.

48:32.581 --> 48:37.584
They'd experienced things
I'd only ever seen on TV.

49:04.444 --> 49:07.362
That was Day One.
D-Day.

49:07.363 --> 49:11.199
Everybody was talking about how
successful the marches were.

49:11.200 --> 49:14.201
Like 1,000 kids went to jail.

49:14.202 --> 49:15.753
Junior and I didn't get arrested.

49:15.754 --> 49:19.005
There were so many kids from all
over the Birmingham area...

49:19.006 --> 49:21.292
that not everybody could
get arrested in one day.

49:21.293 --> 49:24.879
So Sarah and I went back the next
day, Naomi even came with us.

49:24.880 --> 49:26.346
Our whole class was there.

49:26.347 --> 49:27.916
That was Double D-Day.

49:51.237 --> 49:55.574
Then... everything went wild.

50:00.330 --> 50:03.165
They turned the fire hoses
and the dogs on us.

50:31.659 --> 50:33.110
Weren't you scared?

50:33.111 --> 50:35.611
Our freedom was more
important than anything.

50:35.612 --> 50:38.282
You keep saying that.
What do you mean?

50:38.283 --> 50:40.283
I mean, we want to be equal.

50:40.284 --> 50:42.284
We want everything
the white kids get.

50:42.285 --> 50:46.790
We get their old books. We get their old uniforms
for sports when they get everything new.

50:46.791 --> 50:49.793
They're always gonna be ahead,
because they get everything first.

50:49.794 --> 50:51.794
But people got hurt.

50:51.795 --> 50:55.215
Sometimes people get hurt in a fight, but
you still gotta do what you gotta do.

50:55.216 --> 50:57.099
Did you end up in jail?

50:57.100 --> 50:58.099
For almost two weeks.

50:58.100 --> 50:59.885
- Two weeks?
- Well, what about school?

51:00.053 --> 51:01.387
What did your parents do?

51:01.388 --> 51:02.138
My parents supported us.

51:02.139 --> 51:05.108
They were kind of proud of
us, so were our teachers.

51:05.109 --> 51:07.727
Proud of you for going to jail?

51:09.396 --> 51:12.229
I could see the wheels
turning in Byron's head.

51:12.230 --> 51:16.451
If he could make Momma and Daddy proud of
him for going to jail, he was gonna try.

51:16.452 --> 51:19.119
So what's the story now?
Are you all still marching?

51:19.120 --> 51:23.123
We'll see. Some folks are still trying
to keep us out of their schools.

51:23.124 --> 51:25.076
But the law now says they have to.

51:25.077 --> 51:29.464
The law don't matter to some folks. They try
to keep us out, we'll just march again.

51:29.465 --> 51:33.501
Cool. I'd go out
there with you guys.

51:35.804 --> 51:38.506
Slow down, stay together now.
Come on.

51:45.263 --> 51:48.316
Good afternoon, I'd like four
tickets to "To Kill a Mockingbird".

51:48.317 --> 51:51.518
One dollar.

51:52.319 --> 51:56.239
Thank you. You know where
the entrance is, right?

51:56.240 --> 51:58.491
Yeah, I believe I do.

51:58.492 --> 52:03.947
I'm sorry, you know, if it was up to
me, we'd all go through the same door.

52:04.331 --> 52:05.748
Yeah, I understand.

52:05.749 --> 52:07.834
Well, enjoy the show.

52:07.835 --> 52:09.335
Thank you.

52:09.336 --> 52:12.338
Wait, this way, this
way, right around here.

52:12.339 --> 52:16.041
And stay together, okay?

52:16.342 --> 52:18.427
It's this door right here.

52:18.428 --> 52:22.297
Here, let me get ahead of you.
Come on. Come on.

52:22.298 --> 52:24.216
There you go.

52:24.217 --> 52:27.887
Come on. Come on, boy.

52:35.277 --> 52:37.778
Down here.

52:37.779 --> 52:39.480
I think we're right here.

52:46.404 --> 52:49.106
You and me can hare this one.

52:52.910 --> 52:54.409
I couldn't understand
why white folks...

52:54.410 --> 52:57.731
would put colored people right over their
heads when they treated them so mean.

52:58.833 --> 53:01.335
I know what you're thinking.
Don't do it.

53:19.936 --> 53:21.604
That's the film.

53:22.906 --> 53:24.140
Wait a minute.

53:31.864 --> 53:34.416
You know, by the time you wake
up, I'll be halfway home.

53:34.417 --> 53:35.917
Yeah.

53:35.918 --> 53:38.837
So I'm gonna need you to be the man
of this household while I'm gone.

53:38.838 --> 53:43.925
Can you do that for me?
I know you can, but will you?

53:43.926 --> 53:45.259
What do you mean?

53:45.260 --> 53:47.845
I mean, I don't like leaving my family
down here in the segregated south...

53:47.846 --> 53:50.297
not without me, but I
don't have a choice.

53:50.298 --> 53:53.498
I gotta go to work and your mother wants
to spend some time with her mother.

53:53.551 --> 53:54.334
So what do you need from me?

53:54.635 --> 53:57.888
I want you to think before you act.

53:57.889 --> 54:00.892
Because your actions have
real consequences down here.

54:00.893 --> 54:04.895
You are the one I
know I can count on.

54:04.896 --> 54:08.898
Your mother and I are hard on you, because
we see the potential that you have.

54:08.899 --> 54:12.736
You know, if you worked at it, you'd
be just as good as Kenny is at school.

54:12.737 --> 54:19.776
Kenny is just a kid, so, please,
keep an eye on him for me.

54:20.577 --> 54:24.030
I think Birmingham's been
hard on him, all right?

54:25.332 --> 54:28.618
All right.

54:34.006 --> 54:36.840
I couldn't believe how
fast things had changed.

54:36.841 --> 54:39.843
Now Dad was trusting
Byron to look after me?

54:39.844 --> 54:42.547
I had to show them I could
take care of myself.

54:42.848 --> 54:45.550
And that I wasn't just
Poindexter the punk.

54:52.357 --> 54:55.359
Oh, man, Collier's Landing!
Let's go!

54:55.360 --> 54:56.860
Uh-uh, Kenny!

54:56.861 --> 55:00.364
You heard what Grandma Sands said about
that little boy who got lost in the water.

55:00.365 --> 55:03.067
Even Sarah said it isn't safe.

55:03.368 --> 55:05.368
What is that thing called
that she said got him?

55:05.369 --> 55:07.572
Didn't you hear what
she said, Joey?

55:07.872 --> 55:09.756
She said he got caught
by the Wooh Pooh.

55:09.757 --> 55:11.090
Is that a fish?

55:11.091 --> 55:13.093
Uh-uh, you know who Winnie
the Pooh is, don't you?

55:13.094 --> 55:14.093
Mm-hm.

55:14.094 --> 55:15.595
Well, the Wooh Pooh is
Winnie's evil twin brother.

55:15.596 --> 55:18.930
Don't no one ever write about him, because
they don't want to scare y'all kids.

55:18.931 --> 55:24.135
And what he does, is hide in the water
and snatches stupid kids down with him.

55:24.136 --> 55:28.107
Now if Kenny wants to take his stupid, little
behind down there and get snatched, let him.

55:28.108 --> 55:30.107
Even our cousin said they
don't swim out there.

55:30.108 --> 55:33.812
But Byron, what if the Wooh Pooh
comes down to where we're going?

55:33.980 --> 55:35.946
Can't he swim down there
and get people, too?

55:35.947 --> 55:39.017
No, the Wooh Pooh don't
come to no public beaches.

55:39.318 --> 55:41.319
What you gonna do, punk?

55:41.320 --> 55:44.373
Come on, Kenny, you know
what Grandma Sands said.

55:44.374 --> 55:47.876
Our cousins said to
be careful here, too.

55:47.877 --> 55:50.577
Uh, I'm going to Collier's Landing.

55:50.578 --> 55:53.881
And I'm not scared of no Wooh
Pooh, and I'm not a scaredy cat.

55:53.882 --> 55:57.719
Go on, I don't need you looking
out for me all the time.

55:57.720 --> 55:59.921
Fine, suit yourself.

56:00.722 --> 56:03.291
I'm not playing!

56:03.675 --> 56:08.679
I'mma show you!
Ain't nothing to be scared of.

56:08.680 --> 56:11.181
I'm going to Collier's Landing.

56:12.766 --> 56:15.551
You're a couple of jive squares!

57:36.679 --> 57:39.148
Momma! M...

57:39.149 --> 57:40.633
Momma!

58:22.056 --> 58:25.759
Come on, Kenny!
Come on.

58:33.066 --> 58:34.267
Breathe, little brother!

58:39.322 --> 58:42.274
Stop, stop!
Get off of me! Stop!

58:42.576 --> 58:44.778
Kenny! Kenny!

58:50.166 --> 58:52.117
By?

58:56.505 --> 58:58.339
The Wooh Pooh's real.

59:00.226 --> 59:03.228
- I saw it.
- Ssh.

59:03.229 --> 59:05.431
Just catch your breath.

59:07.233 --> 59:08.934
Catch your breath.

59:25.783 --> 59:27.167
How you feeling?

59:27.168 --> 59:28.952
Tired.

59:33.257 --> 59:35.258
Hey, By?

59:35.259 --> 59:38.462
Thanks for not telling Momma
about Collier's Landing.

59:38.762 --> 59:40.379
No problem, baby bro.

59:40.380 --> 59:45.668
You probably will be tired all day,
so I'd take it easy if I were you.

59:47.471 --> 59:49.272
Yeah.

59:49.273 --> 59:53.275
Don't worry, I'll cover for you.

59:53.276 --> 59:58.980
They would blame me anyway, so it's in
my best interest to look out for you.

59:58.981 --> 01:00:04.903
And when they ask, I'll tell them I tired
you out running you around the lake.

01:00:06.289 --> 01:00:10.992
Now I'm going back to sleep.
Those crickets kept me up all night.

01:00:12.294 --> 01:00:16.498
Hey, By? You ready to go home?

01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:20.801
I don't know.

01:00:20.802 --> 01:00:23.804
I may be able to do
some good down here.

01:00:23.805 --> 01:00:25.306
What?

01:00:25.307 --> 01:00:29.310
You'd stay down here,
even if you didn't have to?

01:00:29.311 --> 01:00:31.011
I don't know.

01:00:32.313 --> 01:00:38.318
But... living down here is much
harder than living at home.

01:00:38.319 --> 01:00:41.972
This is your home...
you gotta make it work.

01:00:46.327 --> 01:00:49.861
I'm glad Momma left here
and never came back.

01:00:49.862 --> 01:00:53.115
I hope it's a long time before
we come back down here again.

01:00:58.421 --> 01:01:00.539
You think you're coming
home with us?

01:01:02.792 --> 01:01:04.493
We'll see.

01:01:24.529 --> 01:01:30.984
This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine

01:01:30.985 --> 01:01:37.991
This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine

01:01:37.992 --> 01:01:43.713
This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine

01:01:43.714 --> 01:01:50.719
Let it shine let it shine
Let it shine

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:56.809
Everywhere I go
I'm gonna let it shine

01:01:56.810 --> 01:02:01.014
Let it shine let it shine
Let it shine

01:02:02.399 --> 01:02:03.399
Mommy!

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:06.685
There's my singer!
You were wonderful!

01:02:06.686 --> 01:02:09.188
Thank you.
Guess what?

01:02:09.189 --> 01:02:10.688
What?

01:02:10.689 --> 01:02:13.892
They asked me to sing and help during their
first Holy Run Youth Service on September 15th.

01:02:14.193 --> 01:02:15.193
Oh.

01:02:15.194 --> 01:02:17.194
They need to know, 'cause I
have to make sure I practice...

01:02:17.195 --> 01:02:19.198
all the songs and know
how to run service.

01:02:19.199 --> 01:02:20.198
Mm-hm.

01:02:20.199 --> 01:02:21.416
So can I, Mommy?
Please?

01:02:21.417 --> 01:02:26.371
Well, we were supposed to be home in time
to get ready for school by the 17th.

01:02:26.372 --> 01:02:28.372
Oh, Mommy, we can miss one day.

01:02:28.373 --> 01:02:32.377
I love this church. It's even
better than our church in Flint.

01:02:32.378 --> 01:02:35.379
I know, I miss this
old church, too.

01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:36.880
So?

01:02:36.881 --> 01:02:37.882
I'll talk to your daddy.

01:02:37.883 --> 01:02:39.383
Yay!

01:02:39.384 --> 01:02:42.885
Wait, what? I don't want to spend one
more hot day down here than I have to.

01:02:42.886 --> 01:02:45.089
- Kenny.
- Look how happy the little squirt is.

01:02:51.395 --> 01:02:52.395
Come on, we all right.

01:02:52.396 --> 01:02:54.097
- We all right.
- Down we go.

01:03:02.406 --> 01:03:04.408
You think we're okay to walk home?

01:03:04.409 --> 01:03:06.409
Oh, don't worry.

01:03:06.410 --> 01:03:08.412
Wherever that was, it's in the
opposite direction of where we headed.

01:03:08.413 --> 01:03:13.415
Yeah, we'll be all right.
Sound like it was over in Smithfield.

01:03:13.416 --> 01:03:16.118
I hope the Shores are all right.

01:03:16.419 --> 01:03:17.419
The Shores?

01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:19.421
Yes, baby.

01:03:19.422 --> 01:03:21.624
He's a lawyer.

01:03:21.924 --> 01:03:25.427
And the white folks are mad about all the
work he's been doing in the courts...

01:03:25.428 --> 01:03:28.431
to get them five colored
children into the white schools.

01:03:28.432 --> 01:03:30.431
Is that near our house?

01:03:30.432 --> 01:03:32.934
It's not too close.
Don't worry now.

01:03:32.935 --> 01:03:38.439
Oh, so much been going on
this year, we've been lucky.

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:41.941
Pray that wherever that explosion
was, though, nobody got hurt.

01:03:41.942 --> 01:03:44.445
Okay, Momma, can we please
change the subject?

01:03:44.446 --> 01:03:46.948
We don't need to be talking about these
things in front of the children.

01:03:46.949 --> 01:03:51.651
Well, you can't protect them from it.
They live in it, too.

01:03:51.952 --> 01:03:54.654
That's why it took me so
long to come back down here.

01:03:54.955 --> 01:03:59.459
But you're here now.

01:04:06.383 --> 01:04:10.469
By 11:30, there are more than
200,000 filling the Mall...

01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:13.689
a crowd that is bigger than the
most optimistic forecasts.

01:04:13.690 --> 01:04:18.894
This is amazing. Look at all
those people out there.

01:04:18.895 --> 01:04:23.482
It's so wonderful to see all of these
young people, I mean, this entire year.

01:04:23.483 --> 01:04:29.488
Stand up and demand something
more for themselves.

01:04:29.489 --> 01:04:31.572
I am so proud.

01:04:31.573 --> 01:04:35.993
I think it's wonderful, too.
I just worry for their safety.

01:04:35.994 --> 01:04:38.579
Especially for the
younger children.

01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:41.047
I wouldn't want my babies
out there marching.

01:04:41.048 --> 01:04:44.635
Now you can't stop young folk once
they get an idea in they head.

01:04:44.636 --> 01:04:46.921
Especially when they know
they on the side of right.

01:04:46.922 --> 01:04:49.005
I think it's cool Junior,
Sarah and them marched.

01:04:49.006 --> 01:04:50.007
I would have gone out there.

01:04:50.008 --> 01:04:55.595
Anywhere trouble is, is where
you want to be, Byron.

01:04:55.729 --> 01:04:57.230
What about you, Kenny?

01:04:57.231 --> 01:04:59.349
You think you would
have wanted to protest?

01:04:59.650 --> 01:05:05.155
Mm, mm, all of them people talking about
making the country better for us.

01:05:05.156 --> 01:05:09.727
Ah, it just reminds me
how far I have come.

01:05:09.776 --> 01:05:14.279
Y'all have no idea how
lucky you all are.

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:17.366
When I was growing
up in the country...

01:05:17.367 --> 01:05:22.371
we had to be up in the dark of
morning before the sun come up...

01:05:22.372 --> 01:05:27.376
to start plowing the dirt to
plant the crops we was growing.

01:05:27.377 --> 01:05:32.513
My Daddy was so poor, we
ain't even had a mule.

01:05:32.514 --> 01:05:33.598
I was the mule.

01:05:33.599 --> 01:05:34.800
Oh, Momma...

01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:36.601
Well, it's true.

01:05:36.602 --> 01:05:40.722
Your momma don't know nothing about no hard
work, either, growing up here in Birmingham.

01:05:40.723 --> 01:05:44.225
Mm, it was hard in them days.

01:05:44.226 --> 01:05:51.014
And now, seeing all the changes everybody's
trying to make so that we can all live better.

01:05:53.317 --> 01:05:56.520
Mm, it's a beautiful thing.

01:05:58.322 --> 01:06:00.322
I tried to picture Grandma
Sands with a plow on her back.

01:06:00.323 --> 01:06:05.329
And I'll I could think was, if this woman
was so strong, what's wrong with me?

01:06:05.330 --> 01:06:09.032
Instead of feeling proud,
I just felt scared.

01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:22.761
You're not going to Sunday School?

01:06:22.762 --> 01:06:25.347
I'm going to church with Momma
instead of Sunday School.

01:06:25.348 --> 01:06:28.351
I'mma walk Joey over there and come
back and change before church.

01:06:28.352 --> 01:06:31.553
Oh, so you a big boy now.

01:06:32.354 --> 01:06:35.356
I don't know what a
shoulder shrug means.

01:06:35.357 --> 01:06:36.858
I guess so.

01:06:36.859 --> 01:06:38.560
Come here.

01:06:39.862 --> 01:06:42.747
I know y'all getting
ready to leave.

01:06:42.748 --> 01:06:46.334
I want you to know I'm really
gonna miss you, Kenny.

01:06:46.335 --> 01:06:49.836
I have enjoyed our visit.

01:06:49.837 --> 01:06:54.624
Maybe next time, I'll come visit
you, up there in Michigan.

01:06:56.427 --> 01:07:00.497
Grandma, what was it that you said was
in the water at Collier's Landing?

01:07:00.632 --> 01:07:03.717
What, the whirlpool?

01:07:03.718 --> 01:07:04.718
Yeah.

01:07:04.719 --> 01:07:09.256
Oh, yes, the whirlpool.
You gotta stay away from that.

01:07:09.557 --> 01:07:10.723
I'm all set, Grandma Sands.

01:07:10.724 --> 01:07:12.725
Well, not quite.

01:07:12.726 --> 01:07:18.765
I got you a little something for
your special day at our church.

01:07:33.496 --> 01:07:35.197
Heels?

01:07:36.499 --> 01:07:39.501
I love them!
Thank you, Grandma Sands!

01:07:39.502 --> 01:07:41.503
Oh, you're welcome, sweetie!

01:07:41.504 --> 01:07:45.708
I never understood why girls
got so excited over shoes.

01:07:47.426 --> 01:07:51.228
But I had to admit, those
heels made Joey shine.

01:07:51.229 --> 01:07:52.813
Let's see.

01:07:52.814 --> 01:07:55.816
Oh, you look good, Joey.

01:07:55.817 --> 01:07:59.970
All right now, but come here,
let me fix that slip, it's hanging.

01:08:02.741 --> 01:08:08.829
All right, okay! Y'all better
get going so you won't be late.

01:08:08.830 --> 01:08:11.531
I'd like some sugar!

01:08:15.836 --> 01:08:16.786
- Go!
- Bye!

01:08:16.787 --> 01:08:18.537
Bye!

01:08:27.715 --> 01:08:30.716
- Hey, Joey!
- Huh?

01:08:30.716 --> 01:08:32.718
You look really pretty.

01:08:32.719 --> 01:08:36.555
And I'm sure you're gonna do good in the
choir helping with the service today.

01:08:36.557 --> 01:08:39.091
Thanks, Kenny.

01:08:41.894 --> 01:08:43.645
As Joey caught up
with her friends...

01:08:43.645 --> 01:08:45.645
I couldn't help but think
that the three of them...

01:08:45.647 --> 01:08:49.234
made up the red, white and
blue of the American flag.

01:08:54.038 --> 01:08:55.457
Can you last one more night?

01:08:55.457 --> 01:08:57.707
Just one more.

01:08:57.709 --> 01:09:00.545
Can you believe I'm ready
to get back to Flint, too?

01:09:00.546 --> 01:09:01.779
Really?

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:03.581
Why do you think I left
here in the first place?

01:09:03.582 --> 01:09:08.752
I couldn't take that "colored water
fountain, back-of-the-bus way of living".

01:09:08.754 --> 01:09:12.337
I didn't want my children
to grow up like that.

01:09:12.339 --> 01:09:13.223
What about Grandma?

01:09:13.224 --> 01:09:15.642
She didn't want to leave.

01:09:15.643 --> 01:09:20.647
She's always said, this is her home
and no one is gonna drive her out.

01:09:20.648 --> 01:09:25.636
She's... stronger
than I am, I guess.

01:09:26.687 --> 01:09:28.854
I don't like it here, either.

01:09:28.856 --> 01:09:33.442
But you had fun with Grandma Sands
and Joetta made some good friends.

01:09:33.443 --> 01:09:35.778
- Hey, hey!
- Dad?

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:38.578
Daniel, what are you doing here?

01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:40.082
I didn't think you'd be
back until tonight.

01:09:40.082 --> 01:09:42.582
I missed you guys,
so I left early...

01:09:42.584 --> 01:09:46.455
put the pedal to the metal and
got here as soon as I could.

01:09:46.456 --> 01:09:47.540
Great, so, can we leave tonight?

01:09:47.541 --> 01:09:53.044
Tonight? After 15 hours straight?
I need some rest first.

01:09:53.045 --> 01:09:56.547
Okay, can we leave
tomorrow morning?

01:09:56.548 --> 01:09:58.049
You are really ready
to go home, huh?

01:09:58.050 --> 01:10:01.552
I think we all miss our
little igloo back home.

01:10:01.553 --> 01:10:03.554
Not you, too.

01:10:03.555 --> 01:10:04.756
Even me.

01:10:08.227 --> 01:10:11.695
Now that Dad was back,
everything felt right.

01:10:11.696 --> 01:10:16.684
I was actually looking forward
to Joey's church service.

01:10:19.487 --> 01:10:22.573
Kenny, you all right? Where's
your brother, where's Byron?

01:10:22.874 --> 01:10:26.444
What? That sounded close!

01:10:34.167 --> 01:10:39.672
Wilona! Robert! The baby!

01:10:48.265 --> 01:10:51.467
Oh, no, no, no. You stay here with
your brother. You watch Kenny.

01:11:01.577 --> 01:11:06.815
By? By! By!

01:11:07.616 --> 01:11:09.818
By, where are you?

01:11:10.118 --> 01:11:11.117
By, what happened?

01:11:11.118 --> 01:11:14.789
Someone called and said
somebody bombed Joey's church!

01:11:30.554 --> 01:11:34.473
By! By, wait!

01:11:34.474 --> 01:11:35.758
By!

01:11:52.408 --> 01:11:54.192
Joey!

01:14:34.445 --> 01:14:40.233
Kenny! Where'd you go!
How'd you get back here so fast?

01:14:41.069 --> 01:14:43.321
Where are Mom and Dad?

01:14:50.627 --> 01:14:52.161
Joey?

01:14:56.833 --> 01:15:00.336
You look so beautiful.
So beautiful.

01:15:00.337 --> 01:15:03.673
What? Where's Momma and Daddy?

01:15:05.475 --> 01:15:07.510
Such a beautiful angel.

01:15:10.596 --> 01:15:14.299
I'm no angel... I'm a girl.

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:16.735
What's wrong with you, Kenny?

01:15:16.736 --> 01:15:21.272
Beautiful girl, angel.
I knew you would be.

01:15:21.273 --> 01:15:24.359
Kenny, please, stop playing!

01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:27.245
We need to do something!

01:15:27.246 --> 01:15:32.750
I'm sorry, Joey...
I just couldn't.

01:15:32.751 --> 01:15:35.870
It almost got me.
It got you, too!

01:15:36.004 --> 01:15:38.589
Stop acting crazy!

01:15:38.590 --> 01:15:43.293
We have to go find everyone!
They may be looking for us!

01:15:43.294 --> 01:15:45.829
I can't go back out there.

01:15:47.715 --> 01:15:49.716
It might get me.

01:15:50.017 --> 01:15:51.718
What, Kenny?

01:15:52.019 --> 01:15:52.969
What might get you?

01:15:52.970 --> 01:15:55.388
The Wooh Pooh.

01:15:56.473 --> 01:16:00.810
The Wooh Pooh?
What are you talking about?

01:16:00.811 --> 01:16:04.280
It was there, I saw it,
as big as the sky.

01:16:04.281 --> 01:16:07.901
It was an explosion, no Wooh Pooh!

01:16:11.621 --> 01:16:15.157
I'm sorry, Joey. I just...
I just couldn't do it.

01:16:15.291 --> 01:16:16.942
Kenny, you're scaring me.

01:16:17.043 --> 01:16:20.078
You and I both know that
bomb went off at the church.

01:16:20.079 --> 01:16:23.165
Mommy and Daddy are
probably looking for us.

01:16:23.166 --> 01:16:25.534
We have to go find them. Now!

01:16:25.835 --> 01:16:29.221
It was the Wooh Pooh.
I told you he was real.

01:16:29.222 --> 01:16:31.388
- Joey!
- Joey!

01:16:31.389 --> 01:16:32.723
Joetta, are you all right?

01:16:32.724 --> 01:16:36.260
I'm fine, but I think something
is wrong with Kenny.

01:16:40.482 --> 01:16:44.567
After the church bombing, we couldn't
get out of Birmingham fast enough.

01:16:44.568 --> 01:16:47.071
Grandma Sands and Mr. Robert
refused to come with us.

01:16:47.072 --> 01:16:51.073
They said Birmingham was their home.
It was an issue of principle, they said.

01:16:51.074 --> 01:16:55.079
Grandma Sands called a couple of times and
said the police didn't know who did it.

01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:59.582
But everyone else had an idea
about who was responsible.

01:16:59.583 --> 01:17:01.585
That bomb killed
four little girls...

01:17:01.586 --> 01:17:06.589
blinded a couple more and sent a bunch
of other people to the hospital.

01:17:06.590 --> 01:17:10.793
I couldn't stop wondering about that little
girl who's shoes I saw in the rubble.

01:17:11.094 --> 01:17:13.596
I sure hope Kenny knows
how proud we are of him.

01:17:13.597 --> 01:17:18.300
He's such a good boy,
and I love him so much.

01:17:28.611 --> 01:17:31.312
He is such a brave boy.

01:17:51.215 --> 01:17:53.717
Hey, check this out, Jack.

01:17:53.718 --> 01:17:57.004
And there's another
one coming in, too.

01:17:57.805 --> 01:18:00.806
I hadn't looked at myself
in a real, long time...

01:18:00.807 --> 01:18:03.010
so maybe it was my reflection.

01:18:03.311 --> 01:18:05.813
I'm not sure, but being
there with Byron...

01:18:05.814 --> 01:18:12.518
it was like the flood gates opened up and all
the pain from the summer just poured out.

01:18:29.002 --> 01:18:30.902
I'm sorry, Byron.

01:18:31.203 --> 01:18:35.206
Just shut up and cry if you want.

01:18:35.207 --> 01:18:37.207
Why would they do that, Byron?

01:18:37.208 --> 01:18:40.212
Why would they hurt some
little girls like that?

01:18:40.213 --> 01:18:45.216
I don't know, Mom and Dad said
they can't help themselves.

01:18:45.217 --> 01:18:49.720
They said they did it because
they sick, but I don't know.

01:18:49.721 --> 01:18:52.221
I ain't never heard of no sickness
that makes you kill little girls...

01:18:52.222 --> 01:18:55.192
just because you don't
want them in your school.

01:18:55.193 --> 01:18:59.013
I went to the church.
I saw what happened.

01:18:59.113 --> 01:19:00.814
I saw one of the girls.

01:19:00.815 --> 01:19:05.284
We all did, Kenny. There's nothing
wrong about being sad about that.

01:19:05.285 --> 01:19:06.987
I mean, I'm sad about it.

01:19:08.289 --> 01:19:11.407
I got real scared about it, too.

01:19:11.408 --> 01:19:12.609
I should have saved her.

01:19:12.909 --> 01:19:17.413
Nothing could have been done.
No way, no how.

01:19:18.715 --> 01:19:21.217
I left that little girl.

01:19:21.218 --> 01:19:22.802
I thought the Wooh
Pooh had her and...

01:19:22.803 --> 01:19:26.671
Man, you ain't gonna start talking about
that Wooh Pooh mess again, are you?

01:19:26.672 --> 01:19:29.475
I told you that the
Wooh Pooh was made up.

01:19:29.476 --> 01:19:32.893
The only one I was fighting in that
water was your little, stupid behind.

01:19:32.894 --> 01:19:36.064
There was no one else in
that water but you and me.

01:19:36.065 --> 01:19:38.350
That's what you think.

01:19:40.653 --> 01:19:44.155
But I know better.
I've seen him... twice.

01:19:44.156 --> 01:19:46.474
Look, Kenny, if you don't stop
talking that Wooh Pooh mess...

01:19:46.475 --> 01:19:48.575
I'mma leave you in here
to cry by yourself.

01:19:48.576 --> 01:19:50.444
And there's no such thing
as magic powers, either.

01:19:50.445 --> 01:19:52.663
You can't stay behind the couch
for the rest of your life.

01:19:52.664 --> 01:19:59.453
But, By, I should have stayed at
the church... and looked for Joey.

01:19:59.454 --> 01:20:04.508
Instead... I let the
Wooh Pooh scare me away.

01:20:04.509 --> 01:20:06.377
I wasn't brave enough
to fight him like you.

01:20:06.378 --> 01:20:09.913
And Joey was all right.
She came looking for you.

01:20:10.214 --> 01:20:11.713
How can you believe in something...

01:20:11.714 --> 01:20:15.217
something so stupid as magic powers
or genies living behind a couch?

01:20:15.218 --> 01:20:18.855
But not believe that there was
something that saved Joey?

01:20:18.856 --> 01:20:21.356
It's not fair what
happened to those girls.

01:20:21.357 --> 01:20:24.310
Kenny, things in life
ain't ever gonna be fair.

01:20:25.612 --> 01:20:30.098
You just gotta understand that's the
way it is, and keep on steppin'.

01:20:33.236 --> 01:20:36.489
Here, man, blow your nose.

01:20:37.490 --> 01:20:41.493
Wipe your face, it's about
time you cut this mess out.

01:20:41.494 --> 01:20:44.495
Mom and Dad are starting to think
your little behind is on the blink.

01:20:44.496 --> 01:20:46.465
And don't let me catch
you back there again.

01:20:46.466 --> 01:20:48.966
You ain't got no cause
to be scared of nothing.

01:20:48.967 --> 01:20:51.469
You smart enough to figure
this one out for yourself.

01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:56.424
Besides, you're gettin' this
from the top dog himself.

01:20:56.425 --> 01:20:58.427
You're gonna be all
right, baby bro.

01:20:58.428 --> 01:21:01.713
Okay? You'll be all right.

01:21:11.655 --> 01:21:15.658
Shoot, I sure wish I knew
who my real folks was.

01:21:15.659 --> 01:21:19.362
There just ain't no way two folks
as ugly as your momma and daddy...

01:21:19.663 --> 01:21:22.866
could ever have a
child as fine as me.

01:21:32.759 --> 01:21:34.760
Is everything okay, Byron?

01:21:34.761 --> 01:21:37.261
Kenny's cool. He's
related to me, ain't he?

01:21:37.262 --> 01:21:40.766
Byron Watson, how many times am I gonna
have to tell you not to say ain't?

01:21:40.767 --> 01:21:42.468
Everything all right, Kenny?

01:21:59.201 --> 01:22:03.404
Hey, Poindexter...
watch yourself.

01:22:03.405 --> 01:22:06.207
You hear me?

01:22:06.208 --> 01:22:07.909
What, you deaf now?

01:22:08.210 --> 01:22:10.327
Yeah, I heard you, Larry Dunn.

01:22:12.830 --> 01:22:14.548
What?

01:22:14.549 --> 01:22:15.950
What?

01:22:16.584 --> 01:22:20.086
Just say what you have to
say and leave me alone.

01:22:20.087 --> 01:22:21.922
You can't hurt me.

01:22:21.923 --> 01:22:23.624
Oh, you're gonna pay
for that after school.

01:22:23.625 --> 01:22:26.627
Oh, yeah? Says who?

01:22:31.515 --> 01:22:34.100
I thought you were a coward.

01:22:34.985 --> 01:22:36.686
Look at you.

01:22:42.359 --> 01:22:45.276
Today President Johnson signed
the Civil Rights legislation...

01:22:45.277 --> 01:22:49.280
outlawing discrimination based
on race, religion and gender.

01:22:49.281 --> 01:22:54.986
Thereby making segregation in schools or any
public place illegal across this nation.

01:22:58.624 --> 01:23:03.460
Byron was wrong about there not being
anything like magic powers and genies.

01:23:03.461 --> 01:23:07.549
There might not be magic powers like when
a magician pulls a rabbit out of a hat.

01:23:07.550 --> 01:23:11.635
But the magic of love could
overcome injustice...

01:23:11.636 --> 01:23:16.340
protect against fear
and heal any wound.

01:23:17.141 --> 01:23:20.344
Hey, hey, hey.
