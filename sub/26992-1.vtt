00:44.210 --> 00:46.251
Enjoy the sweet
taste of my lazor beam!

00:46.253 --> 00:50.297
No, not the lazor beam.
Engage force field!

00:50.299 --> 00:51.214
PJ.

00:51.216 --> 00:52.884
Put your seat
belt on, young lady.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.010
No. It's uncomfortable.

00:55.012 --> 00:57.095
Samantha Pepper
I will not ask you again.

00:57.097 --> 00:59.056
Sam, now.

01:01.185 --> 01:02.561
Okay, fine.

01:07.983 --> 01:09.317
Mom!

02:12.215 --> 02:13.965
Open your textbook, please.

02:13.967 --> 02:16.299
Hopefully, we can do better
on the next test.

02:16.301 --> 02:19.429
Electricity was considered
nothing but a dangerous idea

02:19.431 --> 02:22.431
or fad when Edison
was born in...

02:22.433 --> 02:23.560
Anyone?

02:24.352 --> 02:25.351
Ms. Pepper?

02:25.353 --> 02:26.768
1847.

02:26.770 --> 02:28.603
We can't hear you, Smalls.

02:28.605 --> 02:30.231
1847.

02:31.609 --> 02:33.275
But, by 1931,

02:33.277 --> 02:34.943
the time of Edison's death,

02:34.945 --> 02:37.032
cities were powered
by electricity.

02:38.949 --> 02:44.370
PJ... no gum, please.

02:44.372 --> 02:46.705
However, still today,
many do not understand

02:46.707 --> 02:48.916
not only the basics
of electricity,

02:48.918 --> 02:51.251
- but the potential of its power.
- Pathetic.

02:51.253 --> 02:54.088
Electricity can
be made from water, wind,

02:54.090 --> 02:56.465
the sun,
and even animal poop.

02:57.634 --> 02:59.427
Okay. The homework assignment

02:59.429 --> 03:00.970
is written at the end
of the chapter

03:00.972 --> 03:02.596
in your textbook.

03:02.598 --> 03:04.306
Trish, that sounds
like so much fun.

03:04.308 --> 03:06.017
We'll invite everyone.

03:06.019 --> 03:08.393
Well, at least those
who've hit puberty.

03:09.772 --> 03:11.066
Great.

03:42.222 --> 03:49.268
Hey.

03:49.270 --> 03:50.560
Hey. Uh, where's Dad?

03:50.562 --> 03:52.354
Oh, he's busy
with the sink again.

03:52.356 --> 03:54.941
How was school?

03:54.943 --> 03:56.069
Fine.

04:01.116 --> 04:02.614
You sure?

04:02.616 --> 04:03.699
Yeah.

04:33.982 --> 04:35.440
Hey, Dad.

04:35.442 --> 04:36.899
Hey! Can you give me a hand?

04:36.901 --> 04:38.067
Sure.

04:38.069 --> 04:39.651
- Hi, babe.
- Hey.

04:39.653 --> 04:41.945
Can I talk to you
for a second?

04:41.947 --> 04:44.240
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

04:44.242 --> 04:45.824
- You got this?
- Already on it.

04:45.826 --> 04:47.286
- All right.
- Okay.

04:50.415 --> 04:52.250
Hey, sweetie.
What's goin' on?

04:53.500 --> 04:55.584
I don't think you
had a chance to notice,

04:55.586 --> 04:59.421
but she has gum in her hair...
again.

04:59.423 --> 05:01.258
I think she's being bullied
at school.

05:03.261 --> 05:05.385
I think you need
to talk to her.

05:05.387 --> 05:07.262
Okay, okay.
I'm on it.

05:07.264 --> 05:08.389
- Okay.
- All right.

05:08.391 --> 05:09.598
All right.

05:09.600 --> 05:10.724
I gotta go back.

05:10.726 --> 05:11.851
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

05:11.853 --> 05:12.685
- Bye.
- Bye.

05:12.687 --> 05:13.519
See you.

05:13.521 --> 05:15.562
- Bye, Sam!
- Bye!

05:15.564 --> 05:17.106
All right.

05:17.108 --> 05:18.401
How we doin' here?

05:19.569 --> 05:21.112
Hey, um...

05:22.404 --> 05:24.529
How was, um...
How was school today?

05:24.531 --> 05:25.572
Fine.

05:25.574 --> 05:26.949
Channellock.

05:26.951 --> 05:28.286
Gotcha.

05:28.661 --> 05:30.204
Channellock.

05:31.413 --> 05:33.498
Just, um...
Just fine?

05:33.500 --> 05:34.625
Yep.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.461
Okay.

05:38.463 --> 05:40.003
Hey, what are you feelin'
for dinner tonight?

05:46.887 --> 05:49.389
Whoa! Whoa there!

05:49.391 --> 05:51.432
I'm gonna have to give you
the Heimlich.

05:51.434 --> 05:52.933
What's the matter
with you?

05:54.228 --> 05:56.478
That was pretty great of Sydney
to pick you up today.

05:56.480 --> 05:58.147
- Right? I mean...
- Yeah.

05:58.149 --> 06:00.983
That, uh-that sink took me
a lot longer than I expected.

06:00.985 --> 06:02.651
Oh.

06:02.653 --> 06:03.610
I helped. Right?

06:03.612 --> 06:04.654
Mm-hmm.

06:10.495 --> 06:13.120
You like her.
Don't you?

06:13.122 --> 06:14.248
Sydney?

06:15.750 --> 06:16.832
Yes, Dad.

06:19.545 --> 06:21.548
She's practically
part of the family.

06:24.550 --> 06:25.759
What are you doing?

06:27.553 --> 06:29.263
Nothing. What do you mean
what am I doing?

06:30.264 --> 06:31.432
You always do this.

06:33.600 --> 06:34.685
Do what?

06:37.271 --> 06:38.939
Eat your veggies.

06:41.151 --> 06:43.110
Well, you eat yours first.

06:45.154 --> 06:46.529
On three.

06:46.531 --> 06:47.865
One...

06:48.908 --> 06:50.117
- Two...
- Three.

06:51.702 --> 06:52.534
Mmh!

06:52.536 --> 06:54.579
So good.
Back to spaghetti.

06:54.581 --> 06:55.999
- That was a bad piece.

06:57.125 --> 06:58.957
That was for water.

06:58.959 --> 07:00.459
I was thinking we could all
go out to-

07:00.461 --> 07:01.752
to eat, tomorrow night.

07:01.754 --> 07:03.839
You know, the three of us.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.466
Okay.

07:06.468 --> 07:07.802
To our spot.

07:11.348 --> 07:14.682
Our spot?

07:14.684 --> 07:16.561
But we haven't been there
since Mom.

07:17.896 --> 07:19.728
Well...

07:19.730 --> 07:21.688
We haven't been to
a lot of places since Mom,

07:21.690 --> 07:23.649
Sam, but...

07:23.651 --> 07:26.276
...you can't avoid every
little place in this town

07:26.278 --> 07:28.654
that reminds us of her.
You know?

07:28.656 --> 07:32.574
We-we have to allow ourselves
to go out and...

07:32.576 --> 07:34.368
...make new memories.

07:34.370 --> 07:36.454
You're always trying to do that.

07:37.874 --> 07:39.164
Excuse me?

07:39.166 --> 07:42.584
You're always trying
to make new memories.

07:42.586 --> 07:43.586
Samantha.

07:43.588 --> 07:44.631
I'm full.

07:47.509 --> 07:52.553
Sam.

07:52.555 --> 07:54.596
Sam, sit down.

08:07.903 --> 08:09.486
Hey, sweetie.

08:09.488 --> 08:10.697
Hey.

08:10.699 --> 08:11.533
It's bed time.

08:25.588 --> 08:26.923
You're my little girl.

08:27.966 --> 08:29.798
Dad...

08:29.800 --> 08:31.093
But you are.

08:32.428 --> 08:34.679
I can't wait
for dinner tomorrow.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.472
It's gonna be great.
It's gonna be...

08:36.474 --> 08:37.681
...really good for you.

08:37.683 --> 08:38.851
We're gonna have fun.

08:42.187 --> 08:43.188
I love you.

08:43.856 --> 08:44.730
Love you, too.

08:44.732 --> 08:46.648
Well, you know, I...

08:46.650 --> 08:47.733
...have to eat your face.

08:50.029 --> 08:51.028
Okay.

08:51.030 --> 08:53.448
Okay, good night.

08:53.450 --> 08:54.449
- Good night.
- See you tomorrow.

08:54.451 --> 08:56.033
See ya.

09:27.859 --> 09:30.068
It could be anything.
It could be anything at...

09:30.070 --> 09:31.611
Hey, Sam.

09:31.613 --> 09:35.238
Hey.

09:36.158 --> 09:37.657
Again?

09:37.659 --> 09:38.825
It looks like
you have too many

09:38.827 --> 09:40.454
different screw types
going on.

09:41.456 --> 09:43.580
Hmm, I dunno.

09:43.582 --> 09:44.623
It looks to me like
it might be

09:44.625 --> 09:45.624
how I mounted my sensor.

09:45.626 --> 09:47.167
Everyone!

09:47.169 --> 09:49.837
Can I have your attention,
please?

09:49.839 --> 09:50.921
Thank you.

09:50.923 --> 09:52.839
Okay, so Trish's birthday
is this weekend

09:52.841 --> 09:55.509
and we're having
a girls only birthday party.

09:55.511 --> 09:56.511
Sorry, boys.

09:56.513 --> 09:58.054
We haves stacks
of invitations here

09:58.056 --> 09:59.682
for those we're inviting.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.724
Aw, Smalls, don't leave.

10:02.726 --> 10:04.352
You might miss your name.

13:10.999 --> 13:19.088
My mother
gave this to me when I was your age.

13:19.090 --> 13:20.464
She gave it to me
as a reminder

13:20.466 --> 13:22.050
that no matter what,

13:22.052 --> 13:26.387
she will always be here
to protect and guide me.

13:26.389 --> 13:28.263
I'm always here.

13:34.898 --> 13:37.442
Hey, Sammy, let's go!
We're gonna be late!

14:06.638 --> 14:07.469
Thank you.

14:07.471 --> 14:09.014
Thanks.

14:10.015 --> 14:11.932
Hey, now.

14:11.934 --> 14:13.017
Ew.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.227
Hey, now.

14:14.229 --> 14:15.978
- Hey, now.
- Hey, now.

14:18.107 --> 14:18.982
So, what do you think?

14:19.775 --> 14:21.233
I like it, you guys.

14:21.235 --> 14:22.484
I really do.

14:22.486 --> 14:25.113
And I thought you only like
it because of the name.

14:25.115 --> 14:26.238
- Well...
- Still...

14:26.240 --> 14:28.116
- Yep.
- Still kind of a big part of it.

14:28.118 --> 14:29.157
Oh, yeah?

14:29.159 --> 14:30.160
- Yeah.
- Yes.

14:30.787 --> 14:31.618
Yeah.

14:31.620 --> 14:32.954
I think I like hers
the most.

14:32.956 --> 14:34.122
Yeah, um...

14:34.124 --> 14:35.289
- Let me just...
- Hey!

14:35.291 --> 14:36.331
[Aw...

14:36.333 --> 14:37.959
So, I got you something.

14:37.961 --> 14:39.129
Just a little something.

14:39.754 --> 14:40.879
A random thing.

14:42.006 --> 14:43.131
There you go.

14:58.023 --> 14:59.479
If you don't like it,
we can take it back.

14:59.481 --> 15:00.857
No big deal.

15:00.859 --> 15:03.776
It's just that Jim said
it was one of the rarest ones.

15:03.778 --> 15:05.611
No, no...

15:05.613 --> 15:07.532
I really like this.

15:08.866 --> 15:09.825
You do?

15:10.951 --> 15:12.075
Yeah.

15:12.077 --> 15:13.078
Nice.

15:16.791 --> 15:18.541
Not now.
Can't read it now.

15:18.543 --> 15:19.959
After dinner.
Come on.

15:19.961 --> 15:20.877
Eat.

15:20.879 --> 15:22.504
Food just got here.
Eat.

15:23.130 --> 15:24.466
Fine.

15:27.009 --> 15:28.300
Whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey!

15:28.302 --> 15:31.472
Slow your roll!
You forgetting something?

15:32.849 --> 15:33.975
- Good night.
- Good night.

15:35.059 --> 15:36.184
Good night, good night,
good night!

15:36.186 --> 15:38.060
Mm!

15:38.062 --> 15:39.686
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

15:39.688 --> 15:40.897
And?

15:40.899 --> 15:43.232
Thanks, Sydney! Night!

15:43.234 --> 15:44.650
Good night.

16:03.254 --> 16:07.714
"Get your very
own Mail-Order Monster.

16:07.716 --> 16:10.593
Don't be the schmuck
who's pushed around.

16:10.595 --> 16:13.805
Don't be the wallflower
in the crowd.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.723
Frighten your enemies

16:15.725 --> 16:17.432
and amuse your friends.

16:17.434 --> 16:19.142
Send this ad with $20

16:19.144 --> 16:23.605
to Merlin's Emporium
of Monsters and Magic."

16:30.072 --> 16:32.739
Okay, so...
Oh, Samantha!

16:32.741 --> 16:35.368
Just in time. Come on in.
Take your seat.

16:35.370 --> 16:37.036
Mommy forget to drive you?

16:37.038 --> 16:38.787
Oh, wait...

16:38.789 --> 16:42.083
That's... No.
All right. All right.

16:42.085 --> 16:43.834
We are
collecting homework today.

16:43.836 --> 16:46.421
Tommy, would you please collect
the homework assignments?

16:46.423 --> 16:48.756
The rest of you,
please turn

16:48.758 --> 16:50.090
to page 34 in your books.

16:50.092 --> 16:52.844
We're on a new chapter today.

16:56.307 --> 16:57.642
Samantha!

16:58.268 --> 16:59.101
Samantha!

17:02.062 --> 17:03.729
Hi, Mr. Thomas.

17:03.731 --> 17:05.147
Hello, Samantha.

17:05.150 --> 17:06.565
How are you?

17:06.567 --> 17:07.650
Fine.

17:07.652 --> 17:09.234
Good, good.

17:09.237 --> 17:10.444
Um...

17:10.445 --> 17:11.780
How do I put this?

17:12.615 --> 17:14.949
A few of the teachers were...

17:14.951 --> 17:16.867
...in the lunch room yesterday,

17:16.868 --> 17:18.952
and saw what happened
with the whole...

17:18.954 --> 17:21.204
...PJ thing.

17:21.207 --> 17:24.291
Now, we know it
should've never happened,

17:24.294 --> 17:26.626
and PJ knows that now.

17:30.424 --> 17:32.299
So, I just want you to know

17:32.301 --> 17:34.844
that we spoke
to Trish's parents, and...

17:34.846 --> 17:36.013
Here you go.

17:37.432 --> 17:38.892
You're welcome to go.

17:40.602 --> 17:42.437
Okay, good.

17:46.273 --> 17:47.981
Little shrimp got
Mr. Thomas to feel bad for her.

17:47.983 --> 17:49.485
Didn't she?

17:50.153 --> 17:50.985
If I were you,

17:50.987 --> 17:52.944
and I'm really glad I'm not,

17:52.946 --> 17:53.946
I wouldn't come.

17:53.948 --> 17:54.908
There's a height requirement.

17:56.116 --> 17:58.159
Well, at least from down here,
I can see how stuck up

17:58.161 --> 18:01.247
you and your...
fake friends really are.

18:05.292 --> 18:07.043
You think you're so
much better and smarter

18:07.045 --> 18:08.210
than everyone else,
don't you?

18:08.212 --> 18:10.380
Well, news flash,
you're not.

18:10.382 --> 18:12.297
Just go back to your
stupid little comic books

18:12.299 --> 18:13.175
and superheroes.

18:14.426 --> 18:17.303
Wasn't that long ago
you used to dress up like them.

18:17.305 --> 18:19.930
In fact, I still have
your Superman costume.

18:26.480 --> 18:27.771
Wasn't that long ago

18:27.773 --> 18:29.315
you killed your mom.

19:52.192 --> 19:53.482
Hey.

19:53.484 --> 19:54.816
I'm gonna go get ready
for bed.

19:54.818 --> 19:57.362
- Oh.
- You sure you don't wanna come play?

19:57.364 --> 19:58.488
Sydney could use your help.

19:58.490 --> 20:00.405
She said she's good at cards
and she's horrible.

20:00.407 --> 20:02.866
I'm horrible!

20:02.868 --> 20:04.451
No. I'm okay.

20:04.453 --> 20:05.454
Okay. Hey!

20:06.247 --> 20:07.330
How's the comic?

20:08.249 --> 20:11.124
It's... one of a kind.

20:11.126 --> 20:12.418
Good. All right.

20:12.420 --> 20:13.670
I'll, uh-
I'll ask Jim

20:13.672 --> 20:15.882
to give me a call the next
time he gets a new one in.

20:17.675 --> 20:19.049
Baby steps.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.427
I think I did good.

20:23.807 --> 20:25.515
You ready?
You're going down.

20:25.517 --> 20:26.391
Not at cards.

20:52.376 --> 20:54.043
Hey.

20:54.045 --> 20:56.421
What are you doing?

20:56.423 --> 20:57.755
Well, Sam,
you know what I'm doing.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.423
We've talked about this.

20:59.425 --> 21:00.717
I mean, there's so
many pictures.

21:00.719 --> 21:03.135
It's... There's...
We can't have all of these up.

21:03.137 --> 21:04.594
You know?

21:04.596 --> 21:05.973
It's not fair.

21:06.891 --> 21:08.018
To who?

21:08.809 --> 21:09.810
Sydney?

21:10.729 --> 21:12.769
I'm sorry my mom
makes her uncomfortable.

21:12.771 --> 21:16.025
Sam! Sam, you know
that's not true.

21:42.093 --> 21:43.133
Hey.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.510
Have you seen a package
or something like that?

21:45.512 --> 21:47.346
No. Why?
You expecting something?

21:47.348 --> 21:49.391
Could you just tell me
if you do?

21:50.018 --> 21:51.476
Yes, ma'am.

21:51.478 --> 21:52.559
Thanks.

21:52.561 --> 21:54.519
Hey, do you wanna, uh,
go to the movies

21:54.521 --> 21:56.229
tonight with Sydney
and me?

21:56.231 --> 21:58.565
Um... I can't.

21:58.567 --> 22:00.567
I have...

22:00.569 --> 22:02.111
...Science Club.

22:43.278 --> 22:44.948
I found this.

22:50.327 --> 22:52.163
School's been fine.

22:54.124 --> 22:57.210
Well... not that fine.

22:59.796 --> 23:01.381
My grades are still good.

23:03.258 --> 23:05.634
It's-it's just, well...

23:07.011 --> 23:08.221
You know.

23:14.853 --> 23:18.603
I don't know if
Dad's told you yet, but...

23:18.605 --> 23:20.400
...he met someone.

23:23.737 --> 23:26.740
I guess it's...
been a while now.

23:27.699 --> 23:29.993
She's nice. I just...

23:31.076 --> 23:32.994
I don't know...

23:32.996 --> 23:35.915
...why he's trying to...
move on.

23:43.548 --> 23:45.424
We don't need anyone else.

23:46.384 --> 23:47.885
We have you.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.554
We'll always have you.

23:56.978 --> 23:58.018
Hey, babe.

23:58.020 --> 23:58.978
How was court?

23:58.980 --> 24:00.479
Well, it's finally over.

24:00.481 --> 24:02.523
That went significantly
longer than I expected.

24:02.525 --> 24:04.566
Well, are we still on
for a movie tonight?

24:04.568 --> 24:06.068
Yes, yes, I would love to.

24:06.070 --> 24:06.902
Is Sam gonna make it?

24:06.904 --> 24:07.944
Yeah, not tonight.

24:07.946 --> 24:10.282
She's being held hostage
by Science Club.

24:12.076 --> 24:13.325
Oh...

24:13.327 --> 24:15.661
I don't remember her being
in Science Club.

25:08.383 --> 25:09.800
Simple enough.

26:48.441 --> 26:50.317
I can see why this
never took off.

26:51.903 --> 26:52.735
Just add water.

26:52.737 --> 26:54.778
All right. That's it.

26:54.780 --> 26:56.407
I'm callin' it a night.

26:56.990 --> 26:58.574
Okay.

26:58.576 --> 27:00.826
Dress shirts come
out neat and professional.

27:00.828 --> 27:01.744
Pants and slacks...

27:01.746 --> 27:02.828
Good night.

27:02.830 --> 27:04.330
Good night, sweetie.
I love you.

27:04.332 --> 27:05.748
I'm just gonna...

27:05.750 --> 27:07.917
...be here a little longer.

27:07.919 --> 27:09.584
That's fine. Okay.

27:09.586 --> 27:10.585
I'll see you
in the morning.

27:10.587 --> 27:11.837
Okay.

27:11.839 --> 27:14.632
...wrinkles inside
your dryer than Mister Steamy!

27:14.634 --> 27:16.633
Forgot about that load
for hours?

27:16.635 --> 27:18.177
That's a wrinkled mess!

27:18.179 --> 27:20.805
No problem!
Simple toss in Mister Steamy,

27:20.807 --> 27:22.849
and, in minutes, your clothes
are ready to wear!

28:32.420 --> 28:34.545
Bye-bye, Bigfoot.

29:11.999 --> 29:13.042
Ew!

29:15.963 --> 29:18.672
- Wah wah!
- ...everywhere!

29:26.141 --> 29:27.267
Sammy!

29:29.935 --> 29:30.769
Dad?

29:31.563 --> 29:33.478
What are-what are you
doing here?

29:33.480 --> 29:35.023
I'm pickin' you up.

29:35.025 --> 29:36.274
I rode my bike.

29:36.276 --> 29:38.234
Well, no biggy.
We'll throw it in the back.

29:38.236 --> 29:39.861
C'mon. I got something
really special planned

29:39.863 --> 29:43.030
for you and Sydney tonight,
so we gotta go get ready.

29:43.032 --> 29:44.407
What are you talking about?

29:44.409 --> 29:46.745
Dad, I can't. I...

29:47.953 --> 29:49.661
What do you mean?
What do you mean you can't?

29:49.663 --> 29:50.997
We'll throw your bike
in the back.

29:50.999 --> 29:52.748
Come on. I obviously have to shower.
Let's go.

29:52.750 --> 29:54.752
Dad, I-I can't go.
I have...

29:55.795 --> 29:57.128
...detention.

29:57.130 --> 29:59.130
Since when do you
have detention?

29:59.132 --> 29:59.963
Since now.

29:59.965 --> 30:02.007
So I can't go tonight.
Sorry.

30:02.009 --> 30:03.051
Well, hey.
We will, uh...

30:03.053 --> 30:04.259
We'll pick you up
after detention.

30:04.261 --> 30:05.886
Dad, I don't wanna go.

30:20.862 --> 30:23.028
When was the last
time that Sam got detention?

30:23.030 --> 30:25.198
Something's going on with her.

30:25.200 --> 30:26.867
I feel it.
You know?

30:28.411 --> 30:30.121
And I think you do too.

30:34.750 --> 30:38.126
You know, that's one of the
things I love about you the most.

30:38.128 --> 30:39.128
What's that?

30:39.130 --> 30:42.509
You're not afraid
to call me out.

30:43.676 --> 30:46.302
Sydney, you are the...

30:46.304 --> 30:47.761
...most intelligent,

30:47.763 --> 30:50.432
intuitive, caring woman...

30:53.060 --> 30:57.063
We don't really fit in here.
We're... different.

30:57.065 --> 30:59.065
I like that,
and I wouldn't anyone

30:59.067 --> 31:00.732
to come into our life
and change that.

31:00.734 --> 31:02.526
You're exactly what she needs,

31:02.528 --> 31:04.364
and exactly what I need.

31:06.825 --> 31:08.410
When Wendy died...

31:09.576 --> 31:11.827
I never imagined
that I would...

31:11.829 --> 31:14.415
...share my life
with anyone else.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.792
Especially with Sam.

31:18.586 --> 31:20.585
When I see you with Sam,

31:20.587 --> 31:22.171
it gives me hope.

31:22.173 --> 31:24.467
And I thought
all hope was lost.

31:31.141 --> 31:32.974
Would you marry me?

31:34.894 --> 31:36.268
Yes.

31:39.857 --> 31:41.982
Wow, detention
runs late these days.

31:41.984 --> 31:44.570
Yeah, sorry!
Be right there!

31:50.785 --> 31:51.825
Hey.

31:51.827 --> 31:53.494
You make dinner?

31:53.496 --> 31:55.496
No, you-you missed it.
Remember?

31:55.498 --> 31:57.498
Sydney and I
went to Salt & Pepper.

31:57.500 --> 31:59.208
Wow.

31:59.210 --> 32:00.084
There again?

32:17.019 --> 32:19.646
You know, I'm really disappointed
that you couldn't be there.

32:21.106 --> 32:22.230
Well...

32:22.232 --> 32:23.940
Okay...

32:23.942 --> 32:26.526
I mean, we were just there
the other night.

32:34.119 --> 32:35.287
What was that for?

32:36.373 --> 32:37.539
Samantha...

32:38.415 --> 32:40.165
Okay, Dad, I'm sorry

32:40.167 --> 32:41.292
I was...

32:41.294 --> 32:43.544
...rude to you earlier today,
and I...

32:43.546 --> 32:45.298
...promise it won't
happen again.

32:48.843 --> 32:50.301
Keep watching.

32:58.686 --> 33:00.061
Okay...

33:00.063 --> 33:01.478
Now I'm confused.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.023
Sam, I need to talk to you.

33:04.567 --> 33:05.525
Okay.

33:11.115 --> 33:13.783
I, um...

33:13.785 --> 33:16.369
I know it's been hard,
you know,

33:16.371 --> 33:18.578
really hard,

33:18.580 --> 33:21.498
these past few years,
just having me.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.709
I-I like just having you.

33:23.711 --> 33:24.919
Okay, yeah.

33:24.921 --> 33:26.336
But as you get older,
you know,

33:26.338 --> 33:29.215
you're gonna wanna have,
um...

33:29.217 --> 33:31.133
...another female,
a woman,

33:31.135 --> 33:32.301
in-in your life.

33:32.303 --> 33:33.928
You know, someone that you
can talk to,

33:33.930 --> 33:35.680
and trust and rely on.

33:35.682 --> 33:38.684
But, I have-
I have you.

33:42.063 --> 33:43.148
Sam...

33:44.648 --> 33:46.732
Okay. What are you saying?

33:48.694 --> 33:50.902
I proposed.

33:50.904 --> 33:54.157
To...?

33:54.159 --> 33:56.575
I asked Sydney to marry me.

34:04.961 --> 34:10.547
Sam...

34:10.550 --> 34:11.717
Sam...

34:14.179 --> 34:15.427
Sammy.

34:22.643 --> 34:25.188
No, no, no, no.
This isn't real.

34:25.190 --> 34:26.438
Hey, what are you doing?

34:26.440 --> 34:27.648
Come on, now.
Don't be like that.

34:27.650 --> 34:30.150
How could you do this
to me?

34:30.152 --> 34:31.360
Because I'm your father,

34:31.362 --> 34:33.362
and, Sammy, I know
you're a really smart girl,

34:33.364 --> 34:34.737
but believe it or not,

34:34.739 --> 34:36.074
I know what's best for you.

34:36.076 --> 34:37.199
You know what'd be best
for me?!

34:37.202 --> 34:38.242
Having my mom back!

34:38.244 --> 34:40.119
Well, she is gone!

34:44.376 --> 34:46.333
No! Get out!

34:46.335 --> 34:47.293
Get out!

34:47.295 --> 34:50.338
Get out! I hate you!

35:14.947 --> 35:17.532
I asked Sydney to marry me.

36:51.378 --> 36:52.459
Hello?

36:54.213 --> 36:56.298
Hello.

36:57.300 --> 36:58.927
Wow.

37:00.512 --> 37:02.263
Wow.

37:13.108 --> 37:16.400
Wake up! Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!

37:25.786 --> 37:27.494
I'm Sam.

37:27.496 --> 37:29.415
Sam...

37:30.416 --> 37:32.083
What's your name?

37:41.969 --> 37:43.552
MOM.

37:43.554 --> 37:45.762
MOM.

37:45.764 --> 37:46.974
MOM.

37:57.443 --> 37:59.276
That's a hammer.

37:59.278 --> 38:03.155
You use it to smash things.

38:03.157 --> 38:05.950
Hammer.

38:05.952 --> 38:09.162
A lot of things.

38:20.425 --> 38:21.382
Ha!

38:21.384 --> 38:23.219
Interesting.

38:33.228 --> 38:35.314
Whoa! No, no, no, no, no!

38:36.608 --> 38:38.398
You can't go out there.

38:38.400 --> 38:40.485
At least, not yet.

38:40.487 --> 38:41.526
It's not safe.

39:07.472 --> 39:08.431
Crap.

39:12.476 --> 39:14.017
Did you sleep in there
last night?

39:16.398 --> 39:17.938
I did.

39:17.940 --> 39:19.315
Well, what are you...

39:19.317 --> 39:20.650
You can't go in there.

39:20.652 --> 39:21.985
What are you doing in there?

39:23.112 --> 39:25.320
Science project.

39:25.322 --> 39:26.947
I made a big mess in there,
so...

39:26.949 --> 39:28.115
...I'm gonna clean it up.

39:28.117 --> 39:29.534
Okay. I'll help you.

39:29.536 --> 39:30.744
No, no, no, no, no.

39:31.538 --> 39:36.331
It's okay.
Got it.

39:36.333 --> 39:37.918
Okay, well, look, Sam...

39:39.170 --> 39:40.380
We need to talk.

39:42.465 --> 39:43.550
I don't think we do.

39:46.844 --> 39:48.012
Okay.

39:49.139 --> 39:50.640
Okay, well...

39:51.599 --> 39:53.434
I will see you after school.

40:05.487 --> 40:07.697
Okay, so, here's the thing.

40:07.699 --> 40:08.905
I need to go to school,

40:08.907 --> 40:10.700
so you need to stay here.

40:10.702 --> 40:12.367
School.

40:12.369 --> 40:13.744
I need to go to school.

40:15.039 --> 40:17.706
MOM go school.

40:17.708 --> 40:20.377
No, no, MOM.
You can't go to school.

40:28.094 --> 40:41.688
Come on.

40:41.690 --> 40:43.648
Come on. This way.

40:57.581 --> 40:58.500
Okay.

40:59.333 --> 41:02.211
Do not... leave this room.

41:03.420 --> 41:05.213
Okay.

41:05.215 --> 41:07.715
Now, if someone come in here,

41:07.717 --> 41:09.135
what are you going to do?

41:23.190 --> 41:24.858
Yes. Good.

41:26.235 --> 41:27.526
Okay.

41:27.528 --> 41:30.320
So...

41:30.322 --> 41:36.119
These usually
keep me pretty occupied.

41:36.121 --> 41:38.579
Feel free to look through them.

41:38.581 --> 41:40.248
I'll be back later.

41:53.679 --> 41:54.931
Thanks.

42:06.192 --> 42:07.316
What have I done?

42:45.356 --> 42:47.900
So, was it you?

42:51.195 --> 42:52.737
What are you talking about?

42:52.739 --> 42:54.655
The monster in PJ's locker.

42:54.657 --> 43:01.579
I still can't believe
Gigantor peed herself.

43:01.581 --> 43:02.957
No, it wasn't me.

43:24.771 --> 43:26.439
Sorry!

43:48.043 --> 43:49.753
It's okay.
It's just me.

43:50.672 --> 43:52.173
Sam!

43:53.007 --> 43:54.923
We gotta get out of here.

43:54.925 --> 43:56.135
That was a close one.

44:02.224 --> 44:04.518
You're creating a
little whirlpool there.

44:05.728 --> 44:06.978
Hmm. Yeah.

44:06.980 --> 44:08.938
Sorry.

44:08.940 --> 44:10.356
You okay?

44:10.358 --> 44:11.566
Yeah, yeah.

44:11.568 --> 44:12.900
It's, uh...

44:12.902 --> 44:13.820
Everything's great.

44:15.864 --> 44:17.490
What aren't you telling me?

44:20.702 --> 44:21.992
Uh, well...

44:21.994 --> 44:25.829
Sam didn't take to the proposal
as well as I'd hoped.

44:25.831 --> 44:27.041
She isn't ready.

44:27.876 --> 44:29.208
It's too soon for her?

44:29.210 --> 44:30.376
No, no, no, no, no, no.

44:30.378 --> 44:32.586
She's fine.
It's just, uh...

44:32.588 --> 44:33.838
...she doesn't understand, yet.

44:38.135 --> 44:39.135
You know,

44:39.137 --> 44:41.262
we've never really had
any one-on-one time,

44:41.264 --> 44:42.682
just the two of us.

44:43.891 --> 44:45.932
What if we just had,
like, a girls' day?

44:45.934 --> 44:47.436
Think she'd be open to that?

44:48.521 --> 44:49.936
Yeah, yeah.

44:49.938 --> 44:50.940
Yeah?

44:51.733 --> 44:52.856
I mean...

44:52.858 --> 44:54.652
- It's worth a try.
- Yeah.

45:25.891 --> 45:27.101
Mmh!

45:38.028 --> 45:38.862
MOM?

45:45.036 --> 45:46.579
Who?

45:47.371 --> 45:48.580
Where'd you find that?

45:54.336 --> 46:07.097
Wendy.

46:25.242 --> 46:29.537
Hey, MOM...

46:42.719 --> 46:49.932
This is awesome.

46:49.934 --> 46:51.851
All right.
We're almost done.

46:51.853 --> 46:53.101
We just have
one more room left.

46:53.103 --> 46:54.644
Come with me.

47:06.034 --> 47:08.159
I have a feeling you're gonna
have some fun in here.

47:18.045 --> 47:19.755
These are my action figures.

47:21.007 --> 47:23.092
They're similar to the ones
you saw in the comic book.

47:28.972 --> 47:31.476
Let's just...

47:32.601 --> 47:35.394
And here is a...

47:35.396 --> 47:37.315
...robot prototype
I've been working on.

47:38.233 --> 47:40.191
It's not finished yet.

47:40.193 --> 47:41.650
It still has
a few holes in it.

47:41.652 --> 47:43.362
Hey, no! Hey!

47:44.197 --> 47:45.362
Don't touch that.

47:48.034 --> 47:49.577
Okay.

47:51.121 --> 47:52.619
Oh, actually...

48:00.838 --> 48:02.588
It was that
out of place, huh?

48:02.590 --> 48:04.134
Yes.

48:06.177 --> 48:09.302
What... is...?

48:09.304 --> 48:10.847
Just a stupid invitation

48:10.849 --> 48:12.892
from a couple of mean girls.

48:14.018 --> 48:16.019
Bad?

48:16.021 --> 48:16.978
Yes.

48:16.980 --> 48:18.688
These girls...

48:18.690 --> 48:21.275
...well, one in particular,
PJ is bad.

48:24.195 --> 48:27.988
Pee Jay bad?

48:27.990 --> 48:29.824
Yeah.

48:29.826 --> 48:31.244
Which I always think is weird.

48:33.538 --> 48:34.831
We used to be friends.

48:35.539 --> 48:37.831
Friends.

48:37.833 --> 48:38.917
Yeah.

48:40.336 --> 48:42.003
Like me and you.

48:42.005 --> 48:43.173
We're friends.

48:48.010 --> 48:50.137
You want to go outside again?

48:56.353 --> 48:58.394
We can't. I'm sorry.

48:58.396 --> 49:00.106
It's too risky.

49:02.275 --> 49:03.608
We gotta get you
out of here.

49:03.610 --> 49:05.278
Dad's gonna be home
any second.

49:07.780 --> 49:08.905
Sam, you home?

49:08.907 --> 49:10.492
Yeah, Dad.
Be right there!

49:21.795 --> 49:23.251
Step on there.

49:23.253 --> 49:24.336
Come up here.

49:26.257 --> 49:29.050
Gotcha. Come on.

49:29.052 --> 49:30.804
Stay here.

49:33.514 --> 49:36.475
Oh, and don't leave
or make too much noise.

49:38.644 --> 49:40.269
- Hey.
- Dad!

49:40.271 --> 49:43.271
You talking to someone?

49:43.273 --> 49:45.108
Yes... Well...

49:45.110 --> 49:46.983
Myself.
I was talking to myself.

49:46.985 --> 49:48.318
What are you doing?

49:48.320 --> 49:49.780
Well, I was looking for you.

49:50.197 --> 49:51.238
Why?

49:51.240 --> 49:52.951
Why-why is that?
What do you need?

49:53.952 --> 49:55.284
Okay. Because...

49:55.286 --> 49:56.744
Listen.

49:56.746 --> 49:58.996
Sydney wants
to take you out tomorrow.

49:58.998 --> 50:01.001
Sydney.

50:02.376 --> 50:04.043
- I'm okay.
- No, listen. Sam, Sam...

50:04.045 --> 50:05.168
Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam...

50:05.170 --> 50:07.838
Please. Please, just listen.
Okay?

50:07.840 --> 50:09.673
It would mean so much to her.

50:09.675 --> 50:11.217
And to me, too.

50:11.219 --> 50:12.427
And, I mean,

50:12.429 --> 50:13.677
I dunno,
maybe you'll surprise yourself

50:13.679 --> 50:15.512
and end up having
a good time.

50:15.514 --> 50:17.639
You know what's best, right?

50:17.641 --> 50:18.893
Hey, Sam!

50:19.686 --> 50:21.269
Come back over here, please.

50:24.190 --> 50:25.442
Listen to me.

50:26.860 --> 50:28.191
I'm really sorry

50:28.193 --> 50:32.612
about what I said last night.

50:32.614 --> 50:33.866
I'm sorry, too.

50:35.117 --> 50:36.744
Come here.

50:39.998 --> 50:41.583
So, uh...

50:42.916 --> 50:44.376
That means you'll go tomorrow?

50:47.005 --> 50:48.170
Fine.

50:51.050 --> 50:52.342
- Okay, okay.
- That's my girl!

50:52.344 --> 50:54.010
Thank you, thank you.

50:54.012 --> 50:55.427
- Okay.
- Thank you. I love you.

51:18.161 --> 51:22.329
Sam...

51:22.331 --> 51:24.917
Wendy...

51:27.753 --> 51:29.170
Dad...

52:07.293 --> 52:09.334
Sydney?

52:09.336 --> 52:10.713
Who?

52:11.965 --> 52:13.550
It's complicated.

52:14.675 --> 52:17.469
Sydney bad?

52:18.972 --> 52:20.972
Well, I mean...

52:20.974 --> 52:23.057
She's not a bad person.

52:23.059 --> 52:24.269
It's just that...

52:25.394 --> 52:27.230
...she's really
changed my dad.

52:29.065 --> 52:30.983
He can't see it,
obviously.

52:33.360 --> 52:34.943
He keeps saying that...

52:34.945 --> 52:36.487
...we should make new memories

52:36.489 --> 52:40.407
and that she's gonna
be so good for me...

52:40.409 --> 52:41.786
...but she's not.

52:43.996 --> 52:45.704
I don't need new memories,

52:45.706 --> 52:49.374
or a new mom.

52:49.376 --> 52:50.668
MOM?

52:50.670 --> 52:52.336
No, not you.

52:52.338 --> 52:53.882
My mother, Wendy.

53:06.311 --> 53:07.644
This way.

53:19.282 --> 53:21.365
Wendy.

53:21.367 --> 53:23.536
Yes. This is Wendy.

53:26.498 --> 53:27.706
Wendy is...

53:28.875 --> 53:30.751
...well, was my mother.

53:32.295 --> 53:34.503
All I have left of her now
are those pictures

53:34.505 --> 53:36.421
and memories.

53:36.423 --> 53:38.509
My dad just wants
to throw them all away.

53:41.346 --> 53:44.429
When I see those pictures of us

53:44.431 --> 53:45.808
I feel like...

53:46.809 --> 53:49.519
...she's still here...

53:49.521 --> 53:50.647
...with us...

53:52.856 --> 53:54.067
...with me...

53:55.443 --> 53:58.028
...and I didn't cause her
to go away.

53:58.655 --> 53:59.489
I just...

54:00.322 --> 54:02.155
...I don't know what
I'm going to do.

54:15.713 --> 54:18.880
Always here.

54:44.742 --> 54:46.034
Come on.

54:46.036 --> 54:47.744
We should be heading back now.

55:10.476 --> 55:11.560
This way.

55:33.916 --> 55:35.043
PJ...

55:39.255 --> 55:41.088
PJ bad.

55:41.090 --> 55:42.632
MOM, stop!

55:42.634 --> 55:44.592
What are you doing?
Stop!

55:44.594 --> 55:47.387
Come on! Come on!

55:47.389 --> 55:55.228
No.

56:10.286 --> 56:11.494
Now, MOM,

56:11.496 --> 56:14.664
you can't just
go running around like that.

56:14.666 --> 56:16.126
You might get caught.

56:17.043 --> 56:19.671
PJ bad.

56:21.338 --> 56:24.673
Protect Sam.

56:26.677 --> 56:28.096
Thanks.

56:29.222 --> 56:30.807
I got your back, too.

56:32.516 --> 56:34.226
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

57:16.478 --> 57:19.103
Roy, she's getting
too smart for her own good.

57:19.105 --> 57:21.188
That's my girl.

57:21.190 --> 57:23.066
That's our girl.

57:52.012 --> 57:54.014
Hey, Sam, Sydney's here!

57:58.603 --> 57:59.854
Not today.

58:05.318 --> 58:06.400
Hey.

58:06.402 --> 58:07.485
Good morning.

58:07.487 --> 58:08.485
Morning.

58:08.487 --> 58:10.570
Doughnut or fritter?

58:10.572 --> 58:11.738
But, we have an appointment
in 15 minutes,

58:11.740 --> 58:13.451
so we gotta hurry.

58:15.744 --> 58:17.077
Appointment?

58:17.079 --> 58:18.123
Yeah.

59:12.760 --> 59:14.929
Hey! Try these on.

59:29.402 --> 59:32.155
Yep. You were in need
of some new clothes.

59:35.824 --> 59:36.784
Let's see.

59:39.579 --> 59:42.704
Oh, my gosh.
You look amazing.

59:42.706 --> 59:44.331
Do you like it?

59:44.333 --> 59:45.458
You look great.

59:45.460 --> 59:46.333
Can I use the bathroom?

59:46.335 --> 59:47.461
Yeah!

01:00:35.969 --> 01:00:38.304
You know,
I'll be right back.

01:00:44.561 --> 01:00:45.854
Sam?

01:01:01.786 --> 01:01:02.996
Sam?!

01:01:26.561 --> 01:01:27.769
Hey.

01:01:27.771 --> 01:01:31.104
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay.

01:01:31.106 --> 01:01:33.316
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

01:01:33.318 --> 01:01:34.858
I don't
know where she went.

01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:36.445
We're gonna find her.

01:01:37.989 --> 01:01:39.237
We'll find her.

01:01:50.626 --> 01:01:53.378
She said she had
to go to the bathroom.

01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:54.547
I don't know what happened.

01:02:03.972 --> 01:02:04.889
MOM, hurry up.

01:02:04.891 --> 01:02:06.766
Sam!

01:02:06.768 --> 01:02:08.851
Back to school?

01:02:08.853 --> 01:02:11.271
No, not school.
Come on. Follow me.

01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:18.612
Come on.

01:02:25.911 --> 01:02:28.412
I pushed her too hard
with the clothes.

01:02:28.414 --> 01:02:29.748
This isn't your fault.

01:02:32.668 --> 01:02:35.753
Does she have any friends
whose parents we can call?

01:02:35.755 --> 01:02:36.878
I don't know.

01:02:43.679 --> 01:02:44.929
Okay.

01:02:44.931 --> 01:02:46.849
I think it's time
to call the police.

01:02:56.608 --> 01:02:58.860
Where Sam go?

01:02:58.862 --> 01:03:14.458
Don't worry.
We're almost there.

01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:16.586
We're here.

01:03:24.971 --> 01:03:26.972
- Roy.
- Sheriff, come on in.

01:03:34.105 --> 01:03:37.940
Go back home?

01:03:37.942 --> 01:03:39.566
No, we can't.

01:03:39.568 --> 01:03:41.818
That's a life I want
no part in.

01:03:43.114 --> 01:03:45.655
Sydney?

01:03:45.657 --> 01:03:48.992
Kind of.

01:03:48.994 --> 01:03:50.454
A stepmom...

01:03:51.246 --> 01:03:52.996
...bullies...

01:03:52.998 --> 01:03:54.416
...no friends...

01:03:55.751 --> 01:03:59.628
...a new life.

01:03:59.630 --> 01:04:01.215
I don't want any more
part of that.

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:03.173
I don't need that

01:04:03.175 --> 01:04:06.552
now that I have you.

01:04:06.554 --> 01:04:08.095
We got each other's back.

01:04:08.097 --> 01:04:12.143
MOM protect Sam.

01:04:13.478 --> 01:04:14.646
Thanks.

01:04:15.688 --> 01:04:17.022
I'll protect you, too.

01:04:20.735 --> 01:04:22.945
I bet my dad's freaking out
right now.

01:04:24.030 --> 01:04:26.449
Dad bad?

01:04:28.034 --> 01:04:29.575
No.

01:04:29.577 --> 01:04:32.205
Well, I mean, yeah,
right now.

01:04:34.039 --> 01:04:35.958
I dunno.
It's complicated.

01:04:42.882 --> 01:04:43.965
Good night, MOM.

01:04:48.096 --> 01:04:51.181
Good... night.

01:05:19.753 --> 01:05:22.711
Sam?

01:05:22.713 --> 01:05:24.046
PJ?

01:05:28.094 --> 01:05:29.552
Hey, whoa, MOM!

01:05:29.554 --> 01:05:30.887
Stop, no, MOM!

01:05:30.889 --> 01:05:33.057
No, stop, stop!
Calm down!

01:05:38.730 --> 01:05:40.604
PJ...

01:05:40.606 --> 01:05:42.398
...meet MOM.

01:05:52.202 --> 01:05:53.909
Shh. There's nothing
to be afraid of.

01:05:53.911 --> 01:05:55.244
MOM is friendly.

01:05:55.246 --> 01:05:56.831
She won't hurt you.

01:06:00.543 --> 01:06:01.544
Right?

01:06:06.215 --> 01:06:08.509
Hello.

01:06:09.885 --> 01:06:11.719
See? It's nice.

01:06:20.896 --> 01:06:22.188
Everything okay, Roy?

01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:24.648
No, Sheriff,
everything is not okay.

01:06:24.650 --> 01:06:27.275
I'm going crazy
over here. Okay?

01:06:27.277 --> 01:06:28.653
I can't just
sit here anymore.

01:06:28.655 --> 01:06:30.445
I need to be out there
looking for my daughter.

01:06:30.447 --> 01:06:31.405
I know it's hard.

01:06:31.407 --> 01:06:32.407
Roy, listen to me.

01:06:32.409 --> 01:06:35.075
You have to stay home.

01:06:35.077 --> 01:06:35.952
If it were my kid,

01:06:35.954 --> 01:06:37.286
I'd be wanting
to get out there, too.

01:06:37.288 --> 01:06:39.204
But Sam's most likely

01:06:39.206 --> 01:06:40.414
to call or come home

01:06:40.416 --> 01:06:42.583
in the next 48 hours,

01:06:42.585 --> 01:06:44.501
so someone needs to be there.

01:06:44.503 --> 01:06:46.086
I promise...

01:06:46.088 --> 01:06:47.630
...we'll find her.

01:06:47.632 --> 01:06:48.465
Okay.

01:06:49.092 --> 01:06:51.467
I... thank you.

01:06:53.972 --> 01:06:56.266
Sir, we got
another report about a 10-31.

01:06:58.268 --> 01:07:00.478
Roger. 10-31.
We're on our way.

01:07:01.646 --> 01:07:04.063
Another missing kid.

01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:47.398
You're gonna look so good.

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:49.275
Ow!

01:07:50.402 --> 01:07:52.154
Looks like someone
made a new friend.

01:07:53.405 --> 01:07:56.159
PJ friend.

01:07:57.202 --> 01:07:59.746
Glad we could set aside
our differences, MOM.

01:08:02.164 --> 01:08:03.956
Did you name it that
because of...

01:08:03.958 --> 01:08:05.583
No.

01:08:05.585 --> 01:08:08.086
It was the name
that was on the box.

01:08:08.088 --> 01:08:09.586
It's a Mail-Order Monster.

01:08:09.588 --> 01:08:12.548
Pretty lucky you found
that comic book, huh?

01:08:12.550 --> 01:08:13.465
Stop!

01:08:14.802 --> 01:08:18.053
Hey. We should collect
some supplies for a fire.

01:08:18.055 --> 01:08:19.264
It's gonna be
another cold night.

01:08:20.432 --> 01:08:21.890
MOM,

01:08:21.893 --> 01:08:23.643
can you go collect some sticks?

01:08:27.064 --> 01:08:28.273
Thanks.

01:08:33.654 --> 01:08:35.028
Oh!

01:08:35.029 --> 01:08:37.701
And don't get too close to the
road where you might be seen.

01:08:38.243 --> 01:08:39.618
Stay close.

01:08:52.296 --> 01:08:55.299
Good idea for packing these.

01:08:55.301 --> 01:08:57.468
Sorry if I ate too much.

01:08:57.470 --> 01:08:59.428
It's okay.

01:08:59.430 --> 01:09:09.856
I guess I came a little
more prepared than you.

01:09:14.779 --> 01:09:16.072
So, why are you here?

01:09:17.323 --> 01:09:18.575
I could ask you
the same thing.

01:09:19.451 --> 01:09:21.533
Well, my dad
is getting remarried,

01:09:21.536 --> 01:09:23.787
and I'm hiding
a robot-like monster.

01:09:26.166 --> 01:09:27.292
I just left.

01:09:27.957 --> 01:09:30.250
Come on, PJ.

01:09:30.252 --> 01:09:33.295
Look. My life hasn't been
all happy-go-lucky either

01:09:33.296 --> 01:09:35.090
since...

01:09:35.884 --> 01:09:37.133
...since we were...

01:09:37.135 --> 01:09:39.426
Friends?

01:09:39.429 --> 01:09:41.970
You're not gonna lose
whatever popularity you have

01:09:41.971 --> 01:09:44.059
because you admit
we were friends.

01:09:45.268 --> 01:09:46.560
It's already gone.

01:09:47.979 --> 01:09:49.395
They weren't really
my friends, anyway.

01:09:51.106 --> 01:09:53.274
Didn't take too long
for them to abandon me, too.

01:09:55.028 --> 01:09:56.818
I didn't abandon you.

01:09:56.820 --> 01:09:59.321
Sam, you completely shut me out
after the accident.

01:09:59.323 --> 01:10:01.156
Well, my mother did die.

01:10:01.158 --> 01:10:02.991
I'm sorry I didn't
give enough attention to you.

01:10:02.993 --> 01:10:04.661
Whatever.
You always do this.

01:10:05.497 --> 01:10:07.120
Do what?

01:10:07.122 --> 01:10:08.373
Shut people out.

01:10:08.375 --> 01:10:11.375
You completely shut me out
and left me with no one.

01:10:11.377 --> 01:10:14.586
You know how my family is.
I had no one to turn to.

01:10:14.588 --> 01:10:15.671
You were my only friend.

01:10:15.673 --> 01:10:17.255
I had to make new friends.

01:10:17.257 --> 01:10:20.595
Well, you didn't have to turn into
someone else and become a huge jerk.

01:10:25.934 --> 01:10:27.349
I was angry.

01:10:27.351 --> 01:10:29.184
So was I.

01:10:29.186 --> 01:10:31.314
I'm sorry I embarrassed you
in front of everyone.

01:10:32.981 --> 01:10:34.648
It's okay.

01:10:34.650 --> 01:10:46.076
We both know
I deserved it.

01:10:46.078 --> 01:10:50.706
Giant.

01:10:50.708 --> 01:10:51.540
Dwarf.

01:10:51.542 --> 01:10:52.666
- Giraffe.
- Mouse.

01:10:52.668 --> 01:10:53.960
- Bigfoot.
- Hobbit.

01:10:53.962 --> 01:10:55.505
- Stretch.
- Smalls.

01:11:14.858 --> 01:11:16.150
Roy?

01:11:19.194 --> 01:11:20.195
Babe?

01:11:28.954 --> 01:11:30.289
Hi.

01:11:32.792 --> 01:11:34.127
I did this.

01:11:35.211 --> 01:11:39.088
No, you did not.

01:11:39.090 --> 01:11:40.507
No, you did not.

01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:44.346
You are the best dad.

01:11:53.604 --> 01:11:55.397
Your daughter does
need you right now...

01:11:58.525 --> 01:11:59.610
...and...

01:12:01.738 --> 01:12:03.196
...I think she's made it
pretty clear

01:12:03.198 --> 01:12:05.408
that she's not ready
for a stepmom yet.

01:12:07.034 --> 01:12:08.241
Yeah, but she will be.

01:12:08.243 --> 01:12:09.996
I mean, she just needs
some more time.

01:12:12.623 --> 01:12:13.625
No...

01:12:18.128 --> 01:12:19.419
You can't force her

01:12:19.421 --> 01:12:23.340
into something
she's not ready for.

01:12:23.342 --> 01:12:24.510
It's not fair.

01:12:27.721 --> 01:12:34.643
She's been through so much.
You know?

01:12:34.645 --> 01:12:35.727
No, don't do that.

01:12:35.729 --> 01:12:37.064
Don't do that.

01:12:39.567 --> 01:12:40.819
Syd, don't.

01:12:42.945 --> 01:12:44.363
She's not ready.

01:12:48.909 --> 01:12:52.079
And I wanted nothing more than
to be a part of this family.

01:12:54.623 --> 01:13:13.182
I'm so sorry.

01:15:03.461 --> 01:15:04.794
Roy, pick up.

01:15:04.796 --> 01:15:07.213
I think I know where Sam went.
She's at the lake.

01:16:44.186 --> 01:16:45.561
We should get water.

01:16:45.563 --> 01:16:47.065
Yeah. Something to drink.

01:16:47.774 --> 01:16:48.983
Sam!

01:16:49.818 --> 01:16:53.861
PJ?

01:16:53.863 --> 01:16:54.903
Sydney?

01:16:54.905 --> 01:16:56.822
Oh, my God.
I can't believe I found you.

01:16:56.824 --> 01:16:58.534
You need to-
you need to go!

01:16:59.243 --> 01:17:01.576
I need to go?

01:17:01.578 --> 01:17:04.789
Protect Sam.

01:17:07.918 --> 01:17:09.085
You don't need
to worry about me.

01:17:09.087 --> 01:17:10.460
You're not my mom.

01:17:10.462 --> 01:17:12.379
Hey!

01:17:12.381 --> 01:17:13.465
Sam!

01:17:14.134 --> 01:17:15.342
Hey.

01:17:16.051 --> 01:17:17.720
I know I'm not your mom.

01:17:18.805 --> 01:17:20.056
I could never be Wendy.

01:17:21.306 --> 01:17:24.726
And I know you weren't born
to me, but I choose you.

01:17:24.728 --> 01:17:27.394
I choose you
and your father.

01:17:27.396 --> 01:17:28.729
So, forgive me.

01:17:28.731 --> 01:17:31.275
I'm always gonna worry
about you.

01:17:32.735 --> 01:17:34.943
And I need to make sure
the both of you

01:17:34.945 --> 01:17:37.821
get home
where you belong.

01:17:37.823 --> 01:17:39.074
Understand?

01:17:43.662 --> 01:17:44.705
Sam!

01:17:45.707 --> 01:17:47.623
Protect!

01:17:47.625 --> 01:17:48.583
Sam!

01:17:48.585 --> 01:17:50.002
Stop!
What are you doing?!

01:17:52.671 --> 01:17:53.963
Sam!

01:17:53.965 --> 01:17:56.007
Get off her!

01:17:56.009 --> 01:17:57.967
What's happening?
Has it done this before?

01:17:57.969 --> 01:18:00.218
No. This isn't right.

01:18:00.220 --> 01:18:01.803
We need to turn it off.

01:18:01.805 --> 01:18:03.723
The off switch
on the back of the arm.

01:18:03.725 --> 01:18:05.308
MOM, stop!

01:18:05.310 --> 01:18:06.561
It's not working!

01:18:07.395 --> 01:18:08.268
PJ!

01:18:08.270 --> 01:18:10.937
Sydney bad.

01:18:10.939 --> 01:18:12.065
MOM, stop!
You need to calm down!

01:18:12.067 --> 01:18:13.357
She is not bad!

01:18:13.359 --> 01:18:16.653
Sydney bad.

01:18:23.453 --> 01:18:24.410
Sam?!

01:18:24.412 --> 01:18:25.786
That's Sydney's car.

01:18:25.788 --> 01:18:26.829
Wait, Roy.

01:18:26.831 --> 01:18:28.289
There's supposed to be
a storm coming.

01:18:28.291 --> 01:18:29.165
I'll drive us down.

01:18:29.167 --> 01:18:30.583
Okay, all right.

01:18:43.765 --> 01:18:44.972
Sam!

01:18:47.185 --> 01:18:48.726
Baby, baby, baby!

01:18:48.728 --> 01:18:49.936
Hey, hey!

01:18:49.938 --> 01:18:51.187
Hey, sweetie!

01:18:51.189 --> 01:18:54.898
Put her down!

01:19:18.882 --> 01:19:20.633
My God.

01:19:20.635 --> 01:19:21.761
Put her down!

01:19:22.679 --> 01:19:24.219
We need to stop this.

01:19:24.221 --> 01:19:25.556
Come with me.

01:19:34.940 --> 01:19:37.900
You sure about this?

01:19:40.572 --> 01:19:42.487
No! Stay back!

01:19:43.323 --> 01:19:44.699
MOM!

01:20:00.216 --> 01:20:02.008
It's time.

01:20:02.010 --> 01:20:04.012
Sam...

01:20:05.305 --> 01:20:06.931
I'm always here.

01:20:11.060 --> 01:20:14.102
Sam, no!

01:20:14.104 --> 01:20:16.147
Sam!

01:20:57.524 --> 01:20:58.981
Sam?

01:20:58.983 --> 01:21:00.566
Hey, she's awake!

01:21:00.568 --> 01:21:02.110
Hey, Sam!

01:21:02.112 --> 01:21:03.238
Hey, baby!

01:21:05.073 --> 01:21:06.533
How are you? Huh?

01:21:08.076 --> 01:21:09.828
- Dad?
- Yeah, baby!

01:21:10.453 --> 01:21:13.329
I'm so sorry.

01:21:13.331 --> 01:21:15.039
I'm sorry...

01:21:15.041 --> 01:21:16.040
...for what I said.

01:21:16.042 --> 01:21:17.959
- No, shh. Look at me.
- For what I did.

01:21:17.961 --> 01:21:19.671
None of that matters.

01:21:22.047 --> 01:21:24.341
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you, too.

01:21:27.302 --> 01:21:29.639
Sam, how you feelin', honey?

01:21:30.681 --> 01:21:31.680
I'm okay.

01:21:31.682 --> 01:21:32.889
You?

01:21:32.891 --> 01:21:34.267
I'm okay.

01:21:34.269 --> 01:21:36.309
I'm just really glad
you're back.

01:21:40.065 --> 01:21:41.398
Thank you...

01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:51.241
...for finding me.

01:21:51.243 --> 01:21:52.826
Where's your ring?

01:21:52.828 --> 01:21:54.454
Oh...

01:21:54.456 --> 01:21:55.746
...Actually, um...

01:21:55.748 --> 01:21:57.165
Uh, actually, uh...

01:21:57.167 --> 01:21:58.583
...I have it.

01:22:03.006 --> 01:22:04.046
Sweetie...

01:22:04.048 --> 01:22:05.591
...we've decided to...

01:22:07.801 --> 01:22:09.011
It's okay.

01:22:17.770 --> 01:22:24.858
Sydney...

01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:26.486
Will you be my stepmom?

01:22:34.953 --> 01:22:36.997
You don't have to do this.

01:22:39.167 --> 01:22:40.126
I choose you, too.

01:23:40.478 --> 01:23:42.769
When you turn
your pages to chapter six,

01:23:42.771 --> 01:23:46.065
you will see we will now
be covering life science.

01:23:46.067 --> 01:23:49.652
Yes, we are finally
going to do some dissections.

01:24:00.998 --> 01:24:02.331
Dude, check it out!

01:24:02.333 --> 01:24:03.585
Hey, guys.

01:24:10.050 --> 01:24:11.174
What is it about?

01:24:16.305 --> 01:24:17.722
Hey!

01:24:17.724 --> 01:24:19.223
Do you need a ride?

01:24:19.225 --> 01:24:21.183
I rode my bike.

01:24:21.185 --> 01:24:22.518
I'll race you home.

01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:24.644
Already there, slow-poke.

01:24:24.646 --> 01:24:25.854
Ha ha ha.

01:24:39.453 --> 01:24:43.205
Okay, I think we
can call that one a tie.

01:24:43.207 --> 01:24:45.165
Ooh!
Don't be a sore loser, now.

01:24:45.167 --> 01:24:46.709
What?

01:24:46.711 --> 01:24:48.503
Well, you look out
for me next time, little miss.

01:24:48.505 --> 01:24:50.754
Next time, I'll give you
a head start.

01:24:50.756 --> 01:24:51.673
With my training wheels.

01:24:51.675 --> 01:24:53.883
With your training wheels?

01:24:53.885 --> 01:24:55.343
Wow!

01:25:10.819 --> 01:25:12.693
Looking good.

01:25:12.695 --> 01:25:14.863
Thanks.

01:25:15.657 --> 01:25:17.322
Is it ready?

01:25:17.324 --> 01:25:19.325
Well, let's give it a go.

01:25:19.327 --> 01:25:21.035
You can do the honors.

01:25:38.721 --> 01:25:41.013
Hey, hey, no big deal.

01:25:41.015 --> 01:25:42.889
We'll just come out and...

01:25:42.891 --> 01:25:44.142
...give it a try tomorrow.

01:25:44.144 --> 01:25:54.067
Let's go in.

01:26:06.597 --> 01:26:11.597
