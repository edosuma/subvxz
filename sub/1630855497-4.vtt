WEBVTT

00:15.557 --> 00:17.058
I don't understand.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.395
They replaced Jared Browne with a dummy.

00:21.062 --> 00:22.647
We closed the circle.

00:24.274 --> 00:27.318
- Did something go wrong?
- I told you things went wrong.

00:27.318 --> 00:29.487
I told you on the night,
things were going wrong.

00:32.407 --> 00:34.951
Xavier, go with Paul. Now.

00:35.702 --> 00:38.913
You, find your pal Louis and your fiancée.

00:38.913 --> 00:40.999
It's you or them. Call me tonight.

00:42.417 --> 00:44.169
- What, directly?
- With answers.

00:44.544 --> 00:45.712
Hey, is my auntie mad at me?

00:46.254 --> 00:49.507
Hey, Mr. Handpicked, no ask question.
Yeah? Answers.

02:20.515 --> 02:21.683
Oh my God!

02:22.475 --> 02:27.480
Oh my God. Thank you, Eloise. Thank you.
God bless you. Okay.

02:30.066 --> 02:31.776
Jared, bathroom.

02:34.571 --> 02:36.698
- She can meet with us.
- You gon' work?

02:36.698 --> 02:39.534
She say Mr. Chung have a way
to get us home.

02:39.534 --> 02:42.954
We need to check out this motel, now.
They'll wait for us.

02:44.289 --> 02:47.041
- Jared, come.
- What's going on? Are you taking me home?

02:47.041 --> 02:49.210
We're going somewhere else. Come.

03:47.769 --> 03:50.605
- Auntie?
<i>- Aked, love, we are...</i>

03:51.397 --> 03:53.816
going to get everyone together again.

03:54.442 --> 03:58.237
We are going to have another party
and redo the circle.

03:58.237 --> 04:01.366
Mr. Willoughby's idea,
and I think it's a good one.

04:01.366 --> 04:05.411
But you must come. Now, first...

04:06.496 --> 04:08.790
I want to talk to you about your fiancée.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.335
Well, first of all,
that's my ex-fiancée, okay?

04:12.669 --> 04:14.712
<i>Well, I asked you to find her.</i>

04:15.213 --> 04:17.048
Garmen asked you to find her.

04:17.882 --> 04:20.259
She is the cause
for the tear in the circle,

04:20.259 --> 04:23.596
- why we have to redo it.
-<i>I promise I'm gonna find her, all right?</i>

04:23.596 --> 04:25.098
I'm looking for her everywhere.

04:25.723 --> 04:28.643
Her work, my place. I'mma find her.

04:28.643 --> 04:32.313
Well, don't just find her.
You find her and she brother,

04:32.313 --> 04:35.900
and you punish them
like Mr. Chung punished Quincy.

04:36.734 --> 04:37.694
I will find her...

04:38.861 --> 04:41.072
- and I'll do that.
-<i>Good.</i>

04:42.365 --> 04:45.159
<i>And then you can come to the circle
where you'll be safe.</i>

04:45.493 --> 04:47.203
Safe in the circle.

04:48.538 --> 04:49.747
I'll make sure of it.

05:00.508 --> 05:01.718
Okay. Okay.

05:01.718 --> 05:04.887
So, we have each other's location,
so we can always follow.

05:04.887 --> 05:07.390
I go find out how much money he want,
come back here,

05:07.390 --> 05:09.767
then we're going to bring you
back to your parents.

05:36.502 --> 05:38.504
Natalia, oh my God.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.006
- Look at you.
- Eloise.

05:40.006 --> 05:42.050
Thank you. We cannot thank you enough.

05:42.675 --> 05:45.261
Of course, babe. Come this way,
he's waiting for you.

05:59.484 --> 06:00.943
Natalia Williams.

06:01.736 --> 06:02.653
Please.

06:08.242 --> 06:11.579
I understand you're looking for sanctuary,

06:12.413 --> 06:15.750
- or even transportation?
- Yes, sir.

06:15.750 --> 06:19.420
Transportation, actually.
How much that cost?

06:22.673 --> 06:24.967
Nothing, actually.

06:25.468 --> 06:29.388
Eloise says you have information
about Mrs. Mahabir.

06:29.388 --> 06:32.642
If this is true,
that is very valuable to me.

06:33.643 --> 06:37.146
But I'll need to make a phone call first.

06:38.731 --> 06:41.275
I'll get back to you
with your arrangements.

06:42.860 --> 06:43.903
A moment...

06:44.904 --> 06:45.822
please.

06:54.372 --> 06:55.540
Be right back.

07:00.378 --> 07:01.379
Garmen Harry.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.257
<i>Edward Chung here.</i>

07:06.092 --> 07:09.178
Mr. Chung, how may I be of service?

07:10.054 --> 07:13.891
<i>I can deliver someone
I believe you are looking for,</i>

07:13.891 --> 07:18.271
but I would also ask that you would please

07:18.938 --> 07:21.816
pass a message along to Mrs. Mahabir.

07:22.567 --> 07:25.236
<i>Anything, sir. What may I tell her?</i>

07:26.362 --> 07:31.325
That I have 62,500 dollars for her,

07:31.325 --> 07:34.662
<i>which is half of what I took
from the corpse</i>

07:34.662 --> 07:38.249
<i>of her brother-in-law, Quincy.
The other half is mine.</i>

07:40.293 --> 07:42.211
I'm not sure I'm following.

07:42.211 --> 07:47.884
<i>Tell Mrs. Mahabir this is an olive branch.
Quincy was stealing from both of us.</i>

07:48.301 --> 07:51.262
We are more aligned than she might think.

07:51.804 --> 07:54.640
<i>You may pick up the money
when you pick up your masseuse,</i>

07:54.974 --> 07:58.978
who is in my office as we speak.

07:59.562 --> 08:02.440
Is the other one there? The brother?

08:02.440 --> 08:03.900
Louis Williams is he name.

08:04.775 --> 08:06.402
The brother will be here soon.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.531
I'll make sure she makes sure of it.

08:13.201 --> 08:14.410
The bathroom's free now.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.289
In case you have to go.

08:20.875 --> 08:23.294
Now would be a good time to go.

08:26.589 --> 08:28.382
I've spoken to my colleague.

08:29.175 --> 08:32.178
There will be a boat later this evening.

08:33.804 --> 08:36.599
Please ask your brother to join.

08:38.226 --> 08:40.353
And you both may wait until it's ready.

08:41.479 --> 08:43.898
In the meantime, enjoy some roti.

08:44.774 --> 08:46.108
A little taste of home.

08:47.235 --> 08:49.111
All on the house, of course.

08:51.030 --> 08:54.367
Thank you. I am so grateful.

08:59.789 --> 09:01.916
Do you have a bathroom I can use?

09:03.251 --> 09:05.044
Just past the guard on the right.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.171
Thank you.

09:13.177 --> 09:15.888
- May I have my phone, please?
- No.

09:36.867 --> 09:38.286
- Give me the keys.
- What?

09:38.286 --> 09:39.912
Keys. Just shut up. It was a trap.

09:40.746 --> 09:42.456
- What?
- Just shut up.

10:26.959 --> 10:30.379
Jesus. What... How did you get up here?

10:32.923 --> 10:34.300
Do you not have a life?

10:35.676 --> 10:37.219
Depends on your definition.

10:38.012 --> 10:40.765
Well, I don't have much time...

10:41.891 --> 10:45.603
- How can I help you?
- Well, on the subject of life,

10:45.603 --> 10:48.105
why is someone messing
with y'alls personally?

10:48.105 --> 10:50.149
We are asking the same questions.

10:52.360 --> 10:55.154
Like... what does your family have to do

10:55.154 --> 10:58.824
with something called
The Colony at Essequibo?

11:01.035 --> 11:05.456
Hint. The Essequibo is a river in Guyana.

11:07.875 --> 11:11.045
Hint two.
According to my resources at the internet,

11:11.045 --> 11:13.547
it's also the name
of a high-end condo complex

11:13.547 --> 11:17.510
that began construction in 2002-ish?

11:18.344 --> 11:19.387
That somehow

11:20.012 --> 11:24.058
got your Uncle Gene "retired"
from the NYPD.

11:26.102 --> 11:27.645
Well, there you have it then.

11:28.270 --> 11:30.147
You know what my family had to do with it.

11:30.815 --> 11:33.567
Is that why you acted that way
when I asked you about Guyana?

11:34.485 --> 11:36.112
It's a small country and I...

11:36.112 --> 11:38.697
I hadn't thought about it since then,
that's all.

11:38.697 --> 11:41.075
You haven't thought about it
at all since then?

11:41.075 --> 11:43.619
What, am I a suspect now?

11:44.286 --> 11:46.956
I mean... no, but...

11:48.332 --> 11:50.209
I do find you suspect.

11:52.086 --> 11:56.132
Our son was almost kidnapped.
He's upstate in a hunting cabin

11:56.132 --> 11:59.510
because we're afraid
for our lives or his life.

11:59.510 --> 12:03.722
And yes, it's weird. It's...
It's weird for me for the same reasons

12:03.722 --> 12:05.891
it's weird for you,
but I'm sorry, I have...

12:06.976 --> 12:07.977
I have a lot to do.

12:07.977 --> 12:09.979
Have you ever heard of Charisse Henrikson?

12:13.274 --> 12:14.275
Why do you ask?

12:15.151 --> 12:18.195
Because if I have to play hardball,
then I will.

12:19.530 --> 12:22.700
Right, so this is some kind of trade,
you mean?

12:22.700 --> 12:24.535
You could see it that way, I guess.

12:25.161 --> 12:29.665
Because you think I'll be so desperate,
I'll do some kind of emotional crawling?

12:29.665 --> 12:30.958
Does that actually work on people?

12:31.834 --> 12:33.043
The emotional ones, I guess.

12:33.043 --> 12:35.171
Right, and which category
have you put me in?

12:35.838 --> 12:36.714
Well...

12:37.381 --> 12:39.091
I feel like nobody ever worries
about the person

12:39.091 --> 12:40.968
who has to worry about everyone else.

12:42.595 --> 12:43.804
That must be pretty hard.

12:48.184 --> 12:49.101
Okay.

12:50.769 --> 12:54.190
Unless you can show some legal compulsion,
I need to ask you to leave.

12:56.442 --> 12:57.401
Right.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.697
- Right. So... No, you leave now.
- Well... All right.

13:03.032 --> 13:04.825
Nice security system, by the way.

13:04.825 --> 13:06.285
They got that in fast.

13:21.550 --> 13:23.719
What is it with your family and secrets?

13:25.095 --> 13:26.180
What do you mean?

13:27.473 --> 13:30.768
I don't know. What do you mean?
What do any of you people mean?

13:31.602 --> 13:35.564
I'm not talking about your lies, Derek.
I know all about them, trust me.

13:35.564 --> 13:38.192
I do think they're dawning on her though,
if I'm being honest.

13:38.192 --> 13:39.902
I'm talking about your wife's lies.

13:42.112 --> 13:43.030
My wife?

13:44.782 --> 13:46.867
What do you know
about The Colony at Essequibo?

13:47.701 --> 13:48.619
In Guyana?

13:50.412 --> 13:51.372
Hey, Xav.

13:52.498 --> 13:53.415
It's me.

13:55.042 --> 13:56.418
I'm sorry I haven't called.

13:57.002 --> 14:01.090
We weren't sure if it was safe
and we didn't want to get you in trouble.

14:02.925 --> 14:06.387
But mostly, I feel bad
because I lied to you.

14:08.931 --> 14:09.848
We're okay.

14:11.308 --> 14:13.018
We stuck somewhere
and we trying to figure out

14:13.018 --> 14:14.603
how to get back to Guyana.

14:16.438 --> 14:18.315
Maybe you was wanting to get home too?

14:20.651 --> 14:22.278
Maybe we can all talk about it.

14:26.031 --> 14:27.658
If you ain't too mad at me,

14:28.742 --> 14:29.702
give a call.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.422
Xavier didn't pick up.

14:42.673 --> 14:44.550
I think we gotta call Jared's parents.

14:45.301 --> 14:46.343
Just get him back.

14:46.343 --> 14:47.636
Yeah, I don't... I don't think I'm--

14:47.636 --> 14:49.555
- What is your problem?
- You are raas mad.

14:49.555 --> 14:52.641
You got that big house, rich ass parents.

14:52.641 --> 14:55.436
We in this whole mess
because we trying to get you home.

14:56.228 --> 14:57.730
I wish now we never did.

14:58.981 --> 15:00.107
Louis right.

15:01.191 --> 15:03.319
We need to call your parents.

15:03.319 --> 15:05.029
Get them to pay
whatever they gonna pay

15:05.029 --> 15:06.280
and get rid of you.

15:07.364 --> 15:09.533
At least that way
we can get out of New York.

15:09.533 --> 15:11.035
Guys, I really don't wanna--

15:11.035 --> 15:14.747
Since when are you in fucking charge?
Enough from you!

15:16.165 --> 15:17.124
I'm calling them!

15:32.681 --> 15:34.475
- Yes?
- Mrs. Browne?

15:35.059 --> 15:37.478
We got good news. We got Jared.

15:37.895 --> 15:39.355
Wait. What?

15:40.230 --> 15:41.523
<i>We got your son.</i>

15:42.358 --> 15:44.568
<i>But we gonna need just
a little bit of money because--</i>

15:44.568 --> 15:46.737
I... I will call you right back.

15:46.737 --> 15:48.739
Well, I just said
we gonna bring you your son!

15:48.739 --> 15:51.283
I will call you right back!
I will call you right back!

15:58.374 --> 16:01.001
<i>Joey, is he there?
Is Jared with you and safe?</i>

16:01.001 --> 16:03.962
- Yeah, we're about to hit the FDR.
-<i>Turn around.</i>

16:04.713 --> 16:06.215
- I'm sorry?
-<i>Please.</i>

16:06.215 --> 16:08.008
<i>Go back to the cabin. We'll call tomorrow.</i>

16:08.008 --> 16:09.843
<i>Tell him we're fine and I love him</i>

16:09.843 --> 16:12.137
-<i>and I'm sorry. I have to go.</i>
- Okay.

16:14.890 --> 16:15.974
Who was that?

16:16.725 --> 16:19.603
That was your mom. We have to...
We have to head back.

16:21.313 --> 16:23.273
- Back to the cabin?
- Yeah.

16:24.733 --> 16:25.651
Why?

16:26.860 --> 16:28.737
I don't know, man. She didn't say.

16:33.492 --> 16:34.535
I'm sorry.

16:36.412 --> 16:38.580
- What's going on?
- Fuck.

16:39.998 --> 16:41.709
- Sam. Sam, what's going on?
- Hello?

16:41.709 --> 16:43.210
Lady, I ain't playing.

16:43.544 --> 16:45.337
You gonna pay for him?
What we doing here?

16:45.337 --> 16:46.338
Who are you?

16:47.506 --> 16:51.301
-<i>Not get into that.</i>
- Okay... If I may, where are you from?

16:51.301 --> 16:54.513
I don't understand.
Why you ain't want your son back?

16:54.513 --> 16:56.765
Because you don't have our son,
our son is fine.

16:56.765 --> 16:58.183
You have the wrong person.

17:07.609 --> 17:10.487
Wait. This raas.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.950
Okay. Be straight with me now.

17:17.661 --> 17:18.620
Who are you?

17:19.872 --> 17:20.831
So he's alive.

17:21.665 --> 17:23.167
What the fuck, Derek?

17:23.500 --> 17:25.502
- What the fuck, what?
- Who is this boy?

17:25.919 --> 17:29.840
How... how are you not trying
to connect these dots? Unless...

17:31.717 --> 17:33.510
Unless you've already connected them.

17:38.849 --> 17:41.310
I talked to Inspector Harmony, Derek.
She told me.

17:41.310 --> 17:43.395
Yeah, I spoke to that women too.

17:43.812 --> 17:47.733
She asked me about some place
called Esse-pico or quibo.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.818
- Wow. Okay.
- I'm just saying, you know,

17:49.818 --> 17:52.029
- before you get all holy and...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, no.

17:52.029 --> 17:55.532
I see what's happening here.
No. You're parrying, Derek.

17:57.576 --> 17:59.953
Yeah, I guess
I got my answer anyhow. Jesus.

17:59.953 --> 18:01.330
I have another son.

18:09.213 --> 18:10.255
How old?

18:12.299 --> 18:13.217
Sixteen.

18:19.431 --> 18:20.474
What's his name?

18:22.976 --> 18:24.269
Nicholas.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.358
- And hers?
- Look, technically,

18:29.358 --> 18:31.360
it happened during that time
we were broken up--

18:31.360 --> 18:33.487
- Say her fucking name, Derek.
- Charisse.

18:36.949 --> 18:37.950
Charisse.

18:41.286 --> 18:42.913
Technically...

18:44.331 --> 18:48.335
that time was a one-week period
in which we decided

18:48.335 --> 18:52.005
to postpone the engagement,
not the relationship,

18:52.005 --> 18:53.966
but I get that's what you needed
to tell yourself.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.509
I wanted to tell you, Sam.

18:55.509 --> 18:57.302
I wanted to tell you, but I just didn't--

18:57.302 --> 19:00.013
No, Derek. No.
I am not going to comfort you

19:00.013 --> 19:02.224
because you've been lying
and it's been tough on you.

19:02.224 --> 19:04.351
I just didn't want to lose you, Sam.

19:04.351 --> 19:06.728
Please let me say this.
Would you have stayed?

19:06.728 --> 19:10.482
No, you wouldn't have.
Look. I'm sorry I didn't say anything,

19:10.482 --> 19:13.610
but I told myself I would use that,
that mistake,

19:13.610 --> 19:16.905
to make sure that going forward
for the rest of my life... Sam.

19:16.905 --> 19:20.242
Sam, please. I would earn
the right to be your partner.

19:20.242 --> 19:21.910
Where are you going?
I'm trying to talk to you.

19:21.910 --> 19:23.120
- My parents.
- Why?

19:23.120 --> 19:25.956
To get some fucking parenting.
That's how desperate I am.

19:30.377 --> 19:31.920
<i>I don't understand.</i>

19:33.213 --> 19:34.798
You thought, what?

19:36.174 --> 19:40.262
You were gonna go meet Jared Browne
at the Chelsea Piers,

19:41.138 --> 19:44.516
show him his stuff
that you'd been stealing,

19:46.101 --> 19:47.811
and then what was gonna happen next?

19:49.897 --> 19:52.441
He was just gon' invite you home?

19:53.233 --> 19:54.776
Introduce you to he father?

19:55.444 --> 19:56.403
He's my father.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.740
He father, you father, whatever.

20:00.866 --> 20:03.994
You thought you were just gonna
suddenly live at they house?

20:05.120 --> 20:06.204
With all of them?

20:07.122 --> 20:09.374
- Like one big happy family?
- I should be there.

20:10.208 --> 20:11.585
It should be my house too.

20:16.214 --> 20:18.926
But your mother wants to see you, right?

20:19.635 --> 20:21.053
Your real mother.

20:21.845 --> 20:22.763
Actually...

20:23.931 --> 20:25.223
I ran away so...

20:28.018 --> 20:30.520
Now that makes sense
why you don't wanna go nowhere.

20:33.231 --> 20:34.441
Actually, though, I...

20:36.401 --> 20:38.862
I do know where you guys
can get some money.

20:40.614 --> 20:41.990
If I tell you about it,

20:42.908 --> 20:45.994
- we split it?
- Depends on what it is.

20:47.204 --> 20:48.330
Can I have the phone?

20:53.961 --> 20:55.087
Okay.

20:57.297 --> 20:59.800
This is a drawing in their apartment.

21:01.051 --> 21:02.177
It's in the dining room,

21:02.177 --> 21:04.554
so anyone who comes in,
sees it first thing.

21:05.722 --> 21:08.558
It's worth over 250,000 dollars.

21:10.519 --> 21:11.520
So here's the plan.

21:13.021 --> 21:13.939
We steal it,

21:14.856 --> 21:15.774
split the money,

21:16.858 --> 21:18.986
and then all three of us
can get out of New York.

21:18.986 --> 21:20.153
- Mm-mm.
- No.

21:20.153 --> 21:22.572
No, we not stealing no painting.
That's stupid.

21:22.572 --> 21:25.158
And there's no way in hell
we going on a road trip with you.

21:26.118 --> 21:28.412
Nicky, we're taking you back
to your mother.

21:28.412 --> 21:31.164
- Please.
- No. This ain't right.

21:31.999 --> 21:34.710
We ain't that much older than you.
We can't be doing this.

21:35.752 --> 21:37.254
We taking you back.

21:38.672 --> 21:40.757
Actually, wait a minute.

21:42.259 --> 21:43.468
You ain't going nowhere.

21:45.637 --> 21:47.014
I know how to get money.

21:48.640 --> 21:51.226
If your father paid before
to keep your secret...

21:52.769 --> 21:54.896
how much you want to bet
he do it again?

21:56.064 --> 21:57.399
Yeah, they're close by.

21:58.108 --> 22:01.153
All right. No, it'll be you, Len, Victor,

22:01.153 --> 22:03.613
Aked, Xavier, and me. Yeah.

22:04.281 --> 22:08.201
Hey. Bye. What you doing here?
I told you I might need the room.

22:08.201 --> 22:11.663
- I might need the whole house.
- Where the rest of the cash?

22:11.663 --> 22:13.040
The emergency cash is in the bedroom.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.541
- I didn't touch it.
- No playing, raas.

22:14.541 --> 22:17.961
The cash in the cash account.
I'm looking at the bank statement now.

22:17.961 --> 22:19.796
- We out of cash.
- Yeah, I know.

22:19.796 --> 22:21.339
- I'm having a hard time--
- I'm not done.

22:21.339 --> 22:22.424
Hey, hey, hey.

22:23.133 --> 22:25.510
I'm not done.
I'm having a meeting about that.

22:26.094 --> 22:29.222
It's one of the things we're tying up.
We're tying up everything.

22:29.222 --> 22:32.059
I'm going to meet Savitri tomorrow
to get what we're owed.

22:32.059 --> 22:35.353
- Who is Ron Cuneo?
- I... Why? Why? Why?

22:35.771 --> 22:39.316
He from the casino. He called.
He want to be in the meeting tomorrow

22:39.316 --> 22:43.111
- to get the money you owe.
- Ms. Mahabir owes him.

22:43.695 --> 22:46.406
And that's one of the things
I'm tying up, all right?

22:46.406 --> 22:49.409
- Eighty-eight thousand dollars...
- I have a plan.

22:49.409 --> 22:52.204
...to the casino?
Plus, we got a double mortgage,

22:52.204 --> 22:56.124
- we owe school fees, car loan.
- Hannah. Hannah. Hannah.

22:56.124 --> 22:59.669
The idea is we make money,
we go back to Guyana,

22:59.669 --> 23:00.962
and we spend it.

23:00.962 --> 23:04.382
We don't go there to earn money
because that don't work.

23:04.382 --> 23:05.926
I understand. I understand. All right?

23:05.926 --> 23:08.386
Which is why I need the house now.

23:10.013 --> 23:11.765
<i>I'm in a rush, Mr. Cuneo,</i>

23:11.765 --> 23:15.936
and I'm a little fucked family-wise,
so you'll forgive the lack of niceties.

23:16.645 --> 23:19.523
You're aware your folks from the casino

23:19.523 --> 23:23.401
listened to a message you received
while your phone was in their possession.

23:23.902 --> 23:25.028
I am.

23:25.028 --> 23:28.448
Someone from Mrs. Mahabir's
organization called you?

23:29.241 --> 23:30.784
Garmen Harry, yes.

23:31.701 --> 23:36.373
And he asked you to come in
to ostensibly get your remaining money?

23:37.749 --> 23:42.254
Ostensibly meaning what, exactly?

23:43.088 --> 23:45.715
We believe that something's
gone wrong over there,

23:45.715 --> 23:48.009
and this meeting could very well be

23:48.009 --> 23:52.806
about the Mahabir group
trying to tie up, like, loose ends.

23:52.806 --> 23:54.975
And we're told that you've agreed

23:54.975 --> 23:58.186
to return Mr. Harry's call
and inform him you'll be going.

23:59.437 --> 24:02.858
- That's a yes.
- Am I one of those loose ends?

24:02.858 --> 24:05.610
If our suspicions are correct, yes.

24:07.028 --> 24:11.741
So, I'm not gonna be getting paid?

24:11.741 --> 24:12.993
Sweet Jesus!

24:14.452 --> 24:16.997
You think the criminals that you willingly

24:16.997 --> 24:20.333
went into business with
actually want to pay you?

24:20.333 --> 24:21.751
What... What... What is it?

24:21.751 --> 24:28.425
All these people are gathering together
to make sure that Ron Cuneo is made whole?

24:28.425 --> 24:30.594
Make sure he's taken care of? Is that it?

24:31.344 --> 24:33.096
W... So...

24:34.472 --> 24:37.142
you know this... for a fact?

24:37.934 --> 24:41.229
We're up on their phones now,
we know there's a big gathering,

24:41.229 --> 24:42.939
we know you're one
of the invited attendees.

24:42.939 --> 24:46.193
But you'll be wired, Ron.
You'll have backup.

24:46.193 --> 24:50.071
A surveillance van at a staging area,
two tactical vans right behind you.

24:50.071 --> 24:53.491
And until we're ready,
you'll be housed in a secure location,

24:53.491 --> 24:55.744
and you will not have access
to your phones.

24:55.744 --> 24:57.204
All this meets with your understanding?

24:57.204 --> 24:59.122
- Wait a minute...
-"No" is the answer

24:59.122 --> 25:00.498
to the question you're about to ask.

25:00.498 --> 25:03.001
You do not have a choice,
you already agreed.

25:03.418 --> 25:07.547
You'll fill Jessup in?
I gotta call Harmony anyhow.

25:07.547 --> 25:09.883
Sorry for the rush, my daughter's home

25:09.883 --> 25:12.928
from volleyball practice, which she hates.

25:12.928 --> 25:15.805
And I gotta go make her dinner,
which she hates more.

25:15.805 --> 25:17.933
Why? So I can prove to my ex

25:17.933 --> 25:20.769
that I'm capable of continuing
this cycle of torture.

25:20.769 --> 25:22.354
Why does she have so much power?

25:22.354 --> 25:24.522
'Cause every time I get
into a fight with a woman,

25:24.522 --> 25:25.607
I lose.

25:32.822 --> 25:34.199
Did he just say that?

25:35.700 --> 25:37.494
But I don't understand why though?

25:37.494 --> 25:39.871
Because every night
you want McDonald's, Ameena,

25:39.871 --> 25:41.915
- and every night we say no.
- Come.

25:41.915 --> 25:43.625
And tonight, we tell you
you can get McDonald's,

25:43.625 --> 25:46.711
and you're upset.
You too, Sara. In, in.

25:47.295 --> 25:49.297
Hey, daddy got a quick work thing.
All right?

25:49.297 --> 25:52.384
I'm sorry. Enjoy McDonald's.
We not gonna be long.

25:52.384 --> 25:54.135
You love me? You love me?

25:54.511 --> 25:55.887
Oh, God.

25:57.555 --> 25:59.641
- How long you need?
- Hour, tops.

26:01.559 --> 26:03.520
Seatbelts or no Happy Meals.

26:20.453 --> 26:21.371
What?

26:21.955 --> 26:25.542
- What did you do to Sam Browne?
-<i>She is perfectly capable</i>

26:25.542 --> 26:28.211
<i>of taking care of herself
and I did nothing to her.</i>

26:28.211 --> 26:30.171
You did what you've done before.

26:30.797 --> 26:33.925
Cross lines. She texted. You scared her.

26:33.925 --> 26:37.470
Okay, so I'm sorry I scared a suspect?

26:37.470 --> 26:40.974
- Oh, she's a suspect now?
-<i>I don't know.</i>

26:41.808 --> 26:43.476
<i>Maybe? I mean, now that I say it.</i>

26:43.977 --> 26:45.770
- My God.
-<i>I mean, I guess, I don't know,</i>

26:45.770 --> 26:48.148
-<i>you could be one too.</i>
- Mel...

26:49.441 --> 26:52.027
please don't make me a liar, okay?

26:52.027 --> 26:55.822
Are you fucking kidding me?
You covered for me once, a year ago.

26:55.822 --> 26:57.490
-<i>I lied for you.</i>
- Oh my God.

26:57.490 --> 27:00.118
We've been through this.
We have been through this!

27:00.118 --> 27:04.122
Mel, I could've turned in
that psych eval to Pete Fong,

27:04.122 --> 27:06.875
and I should've, but I believed in you.

27:06.875 --> 27:08.918
And worse, I believed you.

27:09.336 --> 27:11.880
But you didn't change, Mel.
This... This...

27:12.505 --> 27:16.718
This going too far, it...
it's evidence, you didn't change.

27:16.718 --> 27:20.347
You... I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry. No, no, no, no. You know what?

27:20.347 --> 27:21.806
What's your history with Sam Browne?

27:21.806 --> 27:24.934
<i>My God, what is your obsession
with Sam Browne?</i>

27:24.934 --> 27:28.855
I talked to her for 90 seconds
and then you call me later scolding me?

27:29.356 --> 27:31.441
Why does she know you?
Why is she calling you?

27:31.441 --> 27:33.985
And running with that,
what's Essequibo to you?

27:35.528 --> 27:36.571
To me?

27:37.906 --> 27:40.367
<i>I get you on this Guyana case</i>

27:40.367 --> 27:43.328
<i>and now somehow you've made it
about Sam Browne and me?</i>

27:43.328 --> 27:44.746
-<i>Come on.</i>
- Oh, my God.

27:45.997 --> 27:47.457
Now I think it is something.

27:47.457 --> 27:49.250
I was guessing before,
but now I think it is.

27:49.250 --> 27:51.961
<i>You don't know anything
because I've said nothing.</i>

27:51.961 --> 27:54.339
Oh, shit. Now I know it's something.

27:56.549 --> 27:58.843
Okay, I have to go. I have to actually go,

27:58.843 --> 28:01.679
because I wish I could continue
this conversation right now,

28:01.679 --> 28:03.098
but I'm gonna call you back later, bye.

28:47.600 --> 28:49.185
- Hey.
- I can't sleep.

28:50.979 --> 28:52.230
It's okay, I'm done.

28:54.566 --> 28:55.483
Come on.

29:11.833 --> 29:12.959
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:12.959 --> 29:14.752
- No.
- What? Huh?

29:14.752 --> 29:16.796
I don't think Garmen want me
to stay out here.

29:17.380 --> 29:18.423
You don't think?

29:19.174 --> 29:22.427
Yeah, you right. You don't think.
You do what I say.

29:22.427 --> 29:24.471
And what I say is stay here,
you understand me?

29:25.805 --> 29:27.765
Look, you got one priority.

29:28.183 --> 29:30.101
Take care of them
and they take care of you.

29:30.643 --> 29:31.561
All right?

29:34.564 --> 29:37.400
I'mma go in there and see what's up.
You stay here.

29:56.669 --> 29:57.879
Here what going on.

29:58.505 --> 30:01.508
I got a very interesting call
from Edward Chung.

30:01.508 --> 30:02.842
Edward Chung called you?

30:02.842 --> 30:06.763
Yeah, he want to reassess
our working relationship.

30:06.763 --> 30:09.015
He had your fiancée, Natalia.

30:09.015 --> 30:11.142
- Ex fiancée.
- All right,

30:11.142 --> 30:13.228
your roommate then, in the bakery,

30:13.228 --> 30:16.231
and he was willing to deliver she
and she brother to me.

30:16.231 --> 30:17.232
However...

30:18.149 --> 30:22.612
she apparently ran away.
So, what I wanna hear about tonight is...

30:23.238 --> 30:24.405
how we can find them?

30:29.577 --> 30:31.287
Wow, you left that unlocked.

30:31.287 --> 30:32.580
All right, so,

30:33.373 --> 30:37.418
you and I can do this silently,
just between me and you.

30:39.295 --> 30:41.130
Or I can make a stink,

30:41.839 --> 30:45.593
but it'd be quite a loud stink
because honestly, I'm quite angry.

30:50.431 --> 30:53.685
Are you wondering whether or not
it's worth the risk to call attention?

30:54.811 --> 30:56.396
Yeah, I mean, you could give it a try.

30:56.396 --> 31:01.359
You know, residential neighborhood,
law enforcement officer, see what happens.

31:08.908 --> 31:09.909
Yes.

31:24.382 --> 31:25.383
Let's go.

31:26.676 --> 31:29.679
You know, as much as I hate to admit it,

31:30.805 --> 31:32.015
Manny Broward is right.

31:32.765 --> 31:35.768
My informant hasn't at all
been informative.

31:35.768 --> 31:38.271
Yeah, but it ain't cool
that you been following me.

31:40.023 --> 31:41.774
Really? Wow.

31:42.525 --> 31:43.901
Sorry that my sworn duty

31:43.901 --> 31:45.778
has gotten in the way
of your botched felony.

31:46.279 --> 31:48.656
So, you all understand
this isn't a resource problem?

31:48.656 --> 31:51.951
We can pay any and who.
This is a time problem.

31:51.951 --> 31:54.078
Right? Where the ass is Xavier?

31:54.078 --> 31:55.747
He needs to be hearing this.

32:12.722 --> 32:13.973
What the fuck?

32:15.558 --> 32:16.476
Really?

32:38.206 --> 32:39.832
Oh, it's your boy, Aked.

32:41.292 --> 32:44.128
Tell him you're with your girl,
which is kind of true.

32:44.462 --> 32:45.630
Keep it quick.

32:47.256 --> 32:49.092
Hey, Aked. Me can't talk right now.

32:49.092 --> 32:51.803
Me just with me girl. All right, bye.

32:55.556 --> 32:56.849
Thank you.

32:59.435 --> 33:00.812
What the fuck?

33:07.985 --> 33:09.028
He's not there.

33:10.238 --> 33:11.781
I think he flaked with his girlfriend.

33:12.990 --> 33:14.701
Oh, God.

33:16.285 --> 33:19.664
Find the girl and you go find him.
That's you too, right.

33:19.664 --> 33:21.624
Track down Louis and Natalia,
don't bring them to me,

33:21.624 --> 33:24.001
- just resolve the situation.
- Right.

33:57.910 --> 33:59.120
<i>Hello, Aked.</i>

34:03.040 --> 34:03.958
Who is this?

34:05.168 --> 34:08.421
<i>Edward Chung. I believe you know who I am.</i>

34:16.763 --> 34:18.598
My ex-girlfriend paid you a visit.

34:19.974 --> 34:23.394
- Is that why you have her phone right now?
-<i>It is.</i>

34:24.187 --> 34:25.897
<i>I assume you'd like it back.</i>

34:26.773 --> 34:28.983
<i>I also have some money
for your Aunt Savitri</i>

34:28.983 --> 34:33.863
<i>I was going to give to Garmen Harry
when he picked up your aunt's masseuse,</i>

34:33.863 --> 34:35.531
<i>but she ran away.</i>

34:36.199 --> 34:37.784
You got money for my auntie?

34:38.576 --> 34:40.828
<i>I am extending an olive branch to her.</i>

34:42.246 --> 34:45.166
<i>May I have it brought to you
with the girl's phone?</i>

34:45.583 --> 34:49.212
<i>You tell me a time and a place,
my men will bring it.</i>

34:49.212 --> 34:50.254
Yeah.

34:51.047 --> 34:52.673
Yeah, you can do that,
but I'm gonna give you

34:52.673 --> 34:54.801
very explicit instructions, you hear me?

35:08.689 --> 35:09.982
No, no, no.

35:09.982 --> 35:12.401
Witness protection is a long-ass process.

35:12.860 --> 35:14.904
This is victim witness security,

35:15.404 --> 35:18.241
but you're only secure if you stay here.

35:18.616 --> 35:22.411
Meaning, you do not call anyone
and you do not leave.

35:23.371 --> 35:24.664
Shall I repeat that?

35:29.126 --> 35:30.545
Voilà.

35:37.802 --> 35:40.847
- So will I have someone watching me?
- No.

35:42.139 --> 35:43.474
But you got this guy.

35:44.308 --> 35:46.435
And I have an app that's connected to it,

35:46.435 --> 35:48.271
so I'll know if you're trying
to mess with it.

35:49.272 --> 35:50.731
Come on. Sit down.

35:56.737 --> 35:58.072
So what's with the circle?

35:59.073 --> 36:01.450
- When?
- In the park.

36:02.451 --> 36:03.369
Saturday night.

36:04.745 --> 36:06.122
Where everything went down.

36:06.622 --> 36:08.291
Something about 20 years ago,

36:08.291 --> 36:10.459
money from here going down
to where I'm from

36:11.168 --> 36:12.837
and people getting kicked off land.

36:14.338 --> 36:15.214
Who?

36:16.632 --> 36:18.342
All I know is Aked said

36:18.342 --> 36:21.262
one of them put the curse
on Ranwell Mahabir.

36:25.224 --> 36:28.603
Someone from way back then
put a curse on Ranwell Mahabir?

36:30.229 --> 36:31.772
Savitri Mahabir's husband?

36:33.482 --> 36:35.109
Didn't he die, like, 15 years ago?

36:37.445 --> 36:39.447
Put the curse on the whole Mahabir family.

36:40.197 --> 36:41.908
And now she trying to take it off.

36:50.499 --> 36:51.584
Hey, Mom.

36:53.169 --> 36:54.211
Sam?

36:55.171 --> 36:56.297
What are you doing here?

36:57.798 --> 36:58.966
Do I need a reason?

37:00.760 --> 37:02.678
You're not working
with Dad this late, are you?

37:03.930 --> 37:06.682
Well, actually, I was wondering
if you were doing anything.

37:07.099 --> 37:08.935
I'm just cleaning, you know,

37:08.935 --> 37:13.105
something, anything really,
just to keep the mind occupied.

37:20.321 --> 37:21.322
Kris?

37:21.948 --> 37:23.616
No, it's actually me, Dad.

37:27.495 --> 37:29.497
I was just thinking about you.

37:30.581 --> 37:33.709
Hey, do you think that we might be able

37:33.709 --> 37:36.504
to get one of those mechanical pens?

37:37.088 --> 37:39.840
You know, it's like, you just sign once

37:39.840 --> 37:42.259
and then the machine,
it does the rest for you.

37:44.095 --> 37:46.931
Yeah, that's a...
That's a Brenda thing. Sure.

37:46.931 --> 37:48.724
Yeah, I'll get into that tomorrow.

37:51.310 --> 37:53.312
- You good?
- Yeah.

37:55.773 --> 37:56.857
Well, good.

38:37.148 --> 38:39.066
<i>You wanted to know
if something is a crime.</i>

38:39.066 --> 38:40.818
<i>Okay, let's start with the obvious.</i>

38:40.818 --> 38:43.195
You only make a series
of deposits and withdrawals

38:43.195 --> 38:46.699
- under 10K if...
- You're trying to avoid flagging the IRS.

38:48.242 --> 38:50.119
Thanks for making the time, by the way.

38:52.038 --> 38:54.081
In January of 2002,

38:54.540 --> 38:59.128
my father-in-law made seven withdrawals,
just under ten grand.

38:59.128 --> 39:01.047
And then like, nine months later,

39:01.047 --> 39:03.215
over a period
of about two and a half months,

39:03.215 --> 39:07.053
he made 35 deposits.
All roughly the same amount.

39:07.053 --> 39:08.804
All of these are on the bank statements,

39:08.804 --> 39:09.972
but they're not in the books.

39:10.431 --> 39:12.683
Literally, the only thing
in an entire decade,

39:12.683 --> 39:14.143
that's unreconciled.

39:14.143 --> 39:16.395
But there's a place in Guyana
called Essequibo.

39:16.395 --> 39:17.980
It's a river. Why do I bring it up?

39:18.731 --> 39:23.235
Just after the last deposit,
Jeff's brother, Gene, was arrested,

39:23.235 --> 39:26.906
but not brought to trial,
on charges of aiding and abetting.

39:27.531 --> 39:28.908
And according to Google,

39:28.908 --> 39:31.744
it involved something called
The Colony at Essequibo.

39:31.744 --> 39:34.663
It's a fancy luxury condo
development down in Guyana.

39:35.122 --> 39:37.124
Oh, Gene was a cop.

39:38.000 --> 39:41.629
I guess he saw it happening
and looked the other way, maybe?

39:41.962 --> 39:43.380
And then maybe even...

39:43.839 --> 39:46.675
- Am I crazy, is this crazy?
- Finish your sentence.

39:47.093 --> 39:50.429
Did Gene get involved?
Did he get my father-in-law involved?

39:51.013 --> 39:54.975
I mean, Jeffrey was shit with money.
Absolute shit.

39:54.975 --> 39:56.685
And then suddenly, he's no longer

39:56.685 --> 39:59.438
some morose corporate tool
in a midlife crisis.

39:59.438 --> 40:00.773
Suddenly, he's Chef Jeff.

40:02.066 --> 40:03.692
If I recall, your wife's an attorney.

40:03.692 --> 40:05.444
- Is she not?
- She is, yes.

40:06.195 --> 40:08.155
Why aren't you asking her this question?

40:10.533 --> 40:13.953
Family law
is just a cozy euphemism, Derek.

40:14.954 --> 40:17.373
What I'm really in
is the marriage-ending business.

40:17.832 --> 40:19.667
And I think I know why you're doing this.

40:21.043 --> 40:23.587
- Doing...
- Gathering evidence against your wife.

40:23.587 --> 40:25.339
Usually, it's a deflection tactic.

40:25.339 --> 40:28.008
The best defense
is a good offense sort of thing.

40:29.260 --> 40:31.262
My wife basically said the same thing.

40:31.804 --> 40:34.723
Well, then here's one
you gotta ask yourself.

40:36.016 --> 40:39.311
Do you wanna be right
or do you wanna be married?

40:42.022 --> 40:43.482
- Jeff.
- What?

40:43.482 --> 40:45.151
She said it's in Guyana.

40:45.151 --> 40:46.986
- Yeah?
- Guyana, South America.

40:47.653 --> 40:50.239
- Yeah?
- I told you, I knew this,

40:50.239 --> 40:54.034
I knew that this had something
to do with Jeff's brother, Gene.

40:54.451 --> 40:57.705
- What are you talking about?
- When Gene lost his job.

40:57.705 --> 40:59.456
- Yeah?
- There was something to do

40:59.456 --> 41:00.833
with Guyana, don't you remember?

41:05.129 --> 41:07.256
- Is he in the area?
- Yeah, he's--

41:07.256 --> 41:08.883
I wasn't really involved in that. What?

41:08.883 --> 41:11.302
- He lives in Queens.
- Yeah.

41:11.302 --> 41:14.263
Do you mind sharing
his contact info with me?

41:14.263 --> 41:16.515
Look, I'll give it to you if you promise

41:16.515 --> 41:18.642
you won't let him know
that I gave it to you.

41:18.642 --> 41:20.311
Oh, well, I'll do my best.

41:20.311 --> 41:22.771
- Here, I can just take a picture of it.
- Here it is. Here.

41:22.771 --> 41:24.565
All right. Well,
if you need anything else,

41:24.565 --> 41:26.192
- give us a call.
- Absolutely.

41:26.192 --> 41:28.777
Yeah. We're always here to help and...

41:31.572 --> 41:33.574
- No.
- You don't even know what I was gonna say.

41:33.574 --> 41:34.909
No, I'm not going to Gene's.

41:34.909 --> 41:36.952
Somebody has to.
All he did was yell at Sam.

41:36.952 --> 41:38.412
- Well...
- Jeff, come on.

41:38.412 --> 41:39.538
I will. I will.

41:39.538 --> 41:40.706
- Just look--
- When?

41:40.706 --> 41:42.666
Let's let the postal lady do her thing,

41:43.292 --> 41:44.585
and I will. Promise.

41:45.836 --> 41:48.047
-<i>Surprise.</i>
- What do you want, Mel?

41:49.006 --> 41:50.925
<i>To confess. I assume you saw</i>

41:50.925 --> 41:52.927
<i>that we have a guest
staying at the Crowne Plaza.</i>

41:52.927 --> 41:53.969
I did.

41:53.969 --> 41:56.555
Well, you can have him now
because I have somebody

41:56.555 --> 41:59.683
- much better.
-<i>Oh, really? Who's that?</i>

42:01.143 --> 42:04.146
You, Manny. You and Sam Browne.

42:04.146 --> 42:06.649
<i>Case in point, Gene McCusker.</i>

42:06.649 --> 42:10.986
<i>And while you're shitting your pants,
just know I don't know much... yet.</i>

42:10.986 --> 42:12.571
<i>But I'm on my way to see him now.</i>

42:13.072 --> 42:16.408
He was a corrupt cop
and he paid the price for his own actions.

42:16.742 --> 42:17.701
Oh, he did?

42:18.285 --> 42:21.372
Yeah, let me guess.
He shot himself in the foot?

42:21.372 --> 42:23.290
Special boys club discount?

42:23.290 --> 42:26.293
Punish yourself, get disability,
perpetuate boys club.

42:26.293 --> 42:29.964
Stop me if I'm wrong about any of this.
But how are you involved, Manny?

42:30.506 --> 42:32.716
You'll find zero inculpatory evidence

42:32.716 --> 42:36.053
that leads you
to where you're salivating to get to.

42:36.053 --> 42:38.264
Yeah, well, I'm sure I won't.

42:38.264 --> 42:41.433
And thank you for confirming
that you buried inculpatory evidence.

42:41.433 --> 42:43.018
That is not what I said.

42:43.852 --> 42:45.104
<i>I'm coming for you, Manny.</i>

42:46.605 --> 42:48.148
This conversation's over.

42:49.024 --> 42:51.777
Hey, Siri, send a text
to Samantha Browne.

42:52.945 --> 42:54.280
<i>What do you want to say?</i>

42:54.738 --> 42:58.742
Meet me in Washington Square Park
as soon as you can. Urgent.

42:58.742 --> 43:01.328
<i>If you work with Manny Broward,
you can leave right now.</i>

43:02.162 --> 43:03.998
I don't care the consequences.

43:06.375 --> 43:07.585
If it makes any difference,

43:07.585 --> 43:09.920
I may hate Manny Broward
more than you do.

43:12.589 --> 43:14.508
I wouldn't think that that is possible.

43:15.634 --> 43:18.512
Well, I think it's maybe a fresher hate.
How about that?

43:19.888 --> 43:20.806
So...

43:22.433 --> 43:23.392
what do you need?

43:25.352 --> 43:27.146
I just wanted to ask about

43:27.980 --> 43:31.900
the ties between you, Manny Broward,

43:31.900 --> 43:35.195
the Brownes, your brother,
and Guyana.

43:36.780 --> 43:39.491
- Guyana?
- Why are you bringing up Guyana?

43:39.491 --> 43:40.951
- What is--
- No, no, no.

43:41.827 --> 43:42.995
The kidnapping.

43:43.829 --> 43:45.748
It had something to do with Guyana.

43:46.999 --> 43:49.793
- Right?
- I think so, yeah. Why?

43:51.295 --> 43:53.005
I made a very bad mistake.

43:54.048 --> 43:55.341
And I paid the price.

43:56.508 --> 44:00.304
The NYPD has the full
internal affairs report,

44:01.221 --> 44:03.557
and I'm sure you can look it up
if you wanted to.

44:03.557 --> 44:06.727
- The charges were dropped.
- Listen, she knows, Cindy.

44:07.519 --> 44:09.605
She knows what really happened.
She's a pro.

44:10.439 --> 44:11.440
Aren't you?

44:12.775 --> 44:14.943
- You know how it's done.
- Your foot.

44:17.946 --> 44:18.864
Yeah.

44:20.032 --> 44:24.995
So how full is this "full" report?

44:25.454 --> 44:28.374
- Is Manny Broward mentioned in it?
- What do you think?

44:30.584 --> 44:33.045
I think he figured out a way
to keep himself clean.

44:35.047 --> 44:37.257
But you think Manny was involved,

44:37.257 --> 44:40.928
but somehow Jeffrey was the one
who turned you in.

44:41.804 --> 44:42.971
Yeah. I know.

44:44.181 --> 44:45.140
You have proof?

44:50.396 --> 44:51.647
You're holding proof.

44:54.274 --> 44:56.568
But you're not gonna tell me
no matter how mad you get

44:56.568 --> 44:58.362
because you don't want to be
like your brother.

44:58.362 --> 45:00.364
Gene has already been
through hell with this, it--

45:00.364 --> 45:02.908
Oh, I... I'm not trying
to take him back to that.

45:02.908 --> 45:04.201
Don't worry.

45:04.201 --> 45:07.621
I'm just trying to figure out
who organized this debacle

45:07.621 --> 45:10.165
in the park the other night and why?

45:13.710 --> 45:14.670
But...

45:15.129 --> 45:19.341
I see that I'm gonna get
no further here, so...

45:22.636 --> 45:26.432
One final question
that won't leave the room.

45:27.724 --> 45:32.146
Do you have anything at all
that might implicate

45:32.730 --> 45:35.482
others that are outside
of this immediate circle?

45:36.400 --> 45:37.776
Someone in another city?

45:38.819 --> 45:40.028
Maybe a bank name?

45:41.739 --> 45:42.656
Why?

45:42.990 --> 45:45.159
Just trying to help
a colleague at the bureau.

45:45.784 --> 45:49.788
But I see you're not gonna say anything
because you're trying to protect someone.

45:52.458 --> 45:55.043
I wish I had someone like you
watching out for me.

45:57.337 --> 45:58.297
Thank you.

46:01.341 --> 46:02.259
Detective.

46:09.266 --> 46:10.184
You're welcome.

46:11.643 --> 46:14.646
<i>Hey, Xav. It's me.</i>

46:16.231 --> 46:17.608
<i>I'm sorry I haven't called.</i>

46:18.901 --> 46:22.070
<i>We weren't sure if it was safe
and we didn't want to get you in trouble.</i>

46:24.031 --> 46:24.948
<i>But mostly,</i>

46:25.908 --> 46:27.826
<i>I feel bad because I lied to you.</i>

46:30.037 --> 46:31.121
<i>We're okay.</i>

46:45.844 --> 46:48.055
-<i>Hello?</i>
- Yo, Shakeela.

46:48.847 --> 46:50.307
- It's me.
-<i>I know it's you.</i>

46:50.307 --> 46:51.642
<i>Where have you been?</i>

46:51.642 --> 46:54.228
Look, I know. I'm sorry.
I should've called. I just...

46:55.103 --> 46:56.688
I just been busy with work, you know.

46:57.231 --> 47:00.359
<i>Xavier, I was really worried
something might have happened to you.</i>

47:00.359 --> 47:02.444
And I know. I make it up to you.

47:02.444 --> 47:05.656
-<i>Okay, I'm listening.</i>
- Are you still at school?

47:05.656 --> 47:07.241
<i>No, we're done for today.</i>

47:08.283 --> 47:09.284
All right, good.

47:10.244 --> 47:12.079
'Cause you'll never guess where I'm at.

47:12.829 --> 47:15.082
Accessory after the fact, Sam.

47:15.541 --> 47:18.627
That's what you're facing
if you talk to Mel Harmony

47:18.627 --> 47:21.004
or anyone. I mean, it...

47:22.256 --> 47:24.216
There's no statute of limitations.

47:26.677 --> 47:29.346
The first round of funding
that your Uncle Gene

47:29.346 --> 47:30.973
knowingly brought you in on,

47:32.057 --> 47:36.103
those were all bribes. Paying off
one corrupt politician after another.

47:38.188 --> 47:42.025
That is what you did.
And that's what I protected you from.

47:43.485 --> 47:47.114
- By having me bury evidence.
- Yes. That's true. Yeah.

47:48.907 --> 47:52.035
Which I assume is also why you
don't want me to say anything

47:52.035 --> 47:53.829
because you could go down as well?

47:53.829 --> 47:56.707
You know what?
I've worked for 30 years, Sam,

47:56.707 --> 48:00.127
on a public servant's salary, all right?

48:00.127 --> 48:03.338
I have a NYPD pension,

48:03.714 --> 48:05.841
a USPIS one.

48:06.425 --> 48:10.971
- That goes, all that goes, if you...
- What? Tell the truth?

48:11.471 --> 48:14.433
Tell a different truth
than you did 20 years ago.

48:21.732 --> 48:23.984
You got my uncle's job, didn't you?

48:24.735 --> 48:29.156
- When I did what I did.
- Buried evidence.

48:29.156 --> 48:31.575
- No, please just answer my question.
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

48:31.575 --> 48:34.369
I saw an opportunity
for advancement and I took it.

48:35.037 --> 48:38.707
But... I didn't take down
an innocent man.

48:39.875 --> 48:42.085
I took down a guilty man, and...

48:44.588 --> 48:45.589
I saved you.

48:47.299 --> 48:48.425
And your dad.

48:50.302 --> 48:53.305
They have nothing
unless you give it to them.

48:54.640 --> 48:56.767
Well, I don't have anything to give them.

48:57.100 --> 48:59.978
It was all destroyed 20 years ago,
as instructed.

49:01.730 --> 49:02.981
Well, that's perfect then.

49:04.316 --> 49:06.610
Then you don't have to do anything.

49:08.278 --> 49:09.905
All you have to do is nothing.

49:10.656 --> 49:13.408
All right? And then everything
goes back to normal.

49:27.923 --> 49:30.842
We believe it's Natalia, my masseuse.

49:30.842 --> 49:33.845
She been working her own obeah
through her hands.

49:34.513 --> 49:36.890
It's the only thing making sense.

49:37.224 --> 49:39.976
The only reason the circle
could've been broken.

49:41.478 --> 49:43.647
Okay. This can't be about the curse.

49:43.647 --> 49:45.982
You seen the troubles we've been having?

49:46.316 --> 49:48.276
All the troubles are not about the curse

49:48.276 --> 49:50.987
put on your family years ago
for whatever reason.

49:51.697 --> 49:55.450
They're about choices
your husband made, you made,

49:56.326 --> 49:57.327
we all made.

49:57.869 --> 50:01.540
Mr. Willoughby is aware
of the break in the circle,

50:02.249 --> 50:04.501
and has taken reparative measures.

50:05.419 --> 50:08.547
Soon, all will be good.

50:09.131 --> 50:11.007
I be dipping a sinking ship, raas.

50:12.843 --> 50:14.094
Any news from Xavier?

50:14.886 --> 50:18.932
- Girlfriend's moving. Len following her.
- Again with the girlfriend.

50:20.892 --> 50:22.811
To be 19. Go bring he here.

50:25.063 --> 50:27.399
Come on, come on. All right.

50:28.191 --> 50:29.443
One second.

50:30.110 --> 50:32.988
All right, Xavier. It's your time.
You got this one.

50:37.617 --> 50:38.618
Okay.

50:41.872 --> 50:43.206
- You all right?
- Hi.

50:45.333 --> 50:47.919
- It's good to see you.
- Wow.

50:48.295 --> 50:51.131
- This... this is nice.
- Right?

50:52.382 --> 50:55.010
- Welcome to the high life.
- How did you afford this?

50:56.470 --> 50:57.846
It's just a work thing, you know.

50:59.347 --> 51:00.599
They pay for it all.

51:01.808 --> 51:03.602
- Are you hungry?
- Always.

51:03.602 --> 51:05.020
All right, then.

51:06.104 --> 51:08.648
- You can pick anything you want.
- Okay.

51:10.567 --> 51:12.736
...and blue cheese. That's my go-to.

51:12.736 --> 51:15.906
- For real?
- Okay, I'm gonna have to try that.

51:20.869 --> 51:22.454
Hey, Shakeela, maybe you should go wait

51:22.454 --> 51:23.705
- in the bedroom.
- Why?

51:23.705 --> 51:25.874
Can you just go and wait
in the bedroom, please?

51:30.670 --> 51:32.422
It's just some work stuff, all right?

51:37.636 --> 51:39.971
I soon come. I coming back just now.

51:42.390 --> 51:45.018
- Xavier, open up.
- This ain't...

51:47.395 --> 51:48.438
Okay.

51:50.565 --> 51:51.858
This ain't what you think.

51:53.026 --> 51:56.238
Hey, what the fuck?
Damn, just relax, my man.

51:56.571 --> 51:58.114
Wait. Wait. No, man.

51:58.114 --> 52:00.408
This ain't what you think.
This ain't what you think, man!

52:01.076 --> 52:02.369
I promise this ain't what you think.

52:02.869 --> 52:06.748
Okay, let me be more accurate
on your assessment of what I do think.

52:07.833 --> 52:10.001
I think you're a piece of shit liar.

52:11.628 --> 52:12.879
And maybe even worse.

52:13.839 --> 52:14.631
Paul!

52:15.465 --> 52:16.675
- Oh, shit.
- Okay.

52:17.259 --> 52:19.427
Now one of two things are true.

52:19.427 --> 52:22.013
Either you're the snitch,
not Louis and Natalia,

52:22.347 --> 52:25.016
or you got caught and now you're singing.

52:25.350 --> 52:26.351
Either way...

52:28.270 --> 52:30.981
- we, you, fucked.
- I can explain.

52:31.773 --> 52:34.776
- Ankle bracelet explains it all.
- I can explain to Garmen.

52:35.652 --> 52:38.405
He send you here to take me to him, right?

52:38.405 --> 52:40.490
I should fucking kill you myself,
you fucking traitor.

52:40.490 --> 52:42.742
No, if Garmen wanted me dead,
I'll be dead.

52:43.243 --> 52:45.453
Which means he sent you here
to take me to him,

52:45.453 --> 52:47.122
so take me to him.
