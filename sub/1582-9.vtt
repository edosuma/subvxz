09:22.598 --> 09:24.399
and hopefully stage
the prison suicide

09:24.433 --> 09:26.367
of the mastermind of
this operation--

09:26.402 --> 09:27.702
Homer Simpson!

09:27.736 --> 09:29.571
Ooh, mastermind.

09:29.605 --> 09:32.140
We got our man,
thanks to a tip

09:32.174 --> 09:34.576
from a heroic
American snitch.

09:34.610 --> 09:37.378
(gasps) One of you
turned me in?

09:37.413 --> 09:40.114
Who was it?

09:40.149 --> 09:41.316
You!

09:42.685 --> 09:44.352
Superintendent
Chalmers,

09:44.386 --> 09:46.054
you never forgave me
for that time

09:46.088 --> 09:48.389
we wore the same Hawaiian
shirt to that luau!

09:50.059 --> 09:51.593
They're gonna
take Dad!

09:51.627 --> 09:53.461
We gotta do something!
I'm on it.

09:59.168 --> 10:02.203
(screams)
Copyrighted material!

10:02.238 --> 10:04.138
Don't look at it!

10:04.173 --> 10:06.007
Someone sell me
a ticket!

10:06.041 --> 10:07.342
Ear plugs in!
Blinders on!

10:07.376 --> 10:09.677
We trained
for this!

10:16.819 --> 10:18.486
(gunshot)

10:18.520 --> 10:21.055
(grunting)

10:25.294 --> 10:26.661
From now on,

10:26.695 --> 10:28.529
the only place you'll
be watching movies

10:28.564 --> 10:30.365
without having to buy
a ticket is jail.

10:31.367 --> 10:34.002
Oh... oh... (whimpers)

10:34.036 --> 10:36.204
Baby, promise me

10:36.238 --> 10:37.672
you'll find out
who turned me in.

10:37.706 --> 10:39.340
(moans)

10:39.375 --> 10:41.643
It's probably someone
I would never suspect.

10:41.677 --> 10:43.511
Never suspect.

10:43.545 --> 10:45.146
(moans)

10:45.180 --> 10:47.649
Your moans of sympathy
are all I have.

10:47.683 --> 10:49.617
Oh...

10:49.652 --> 10:51.619
HOMER: Whoever did this to me
will be haunted

10:51.654 --> 10:54.188
by unbearable guilt forever!

10:55.324 --> 10:56.591
Forever!

11:04.465 --> 11:06.283
What are you guys in for?

11:06.284 --> 11:07.351
Bank robbery.

11:07.770 --> 11:08.970
Drug trafficking.

11:09.004 --> 11:10.038
What about you?

11:10.072 --> 11:11.239
Movie piracy.

11:11.273 --> 11:12.273
(all gasp)
What?!

11:12.307 --> 11:13.541
People in show business

11:13.575 --> 11:15.743
work hard
to make those movies.

11:15.778 --> 11:19.881
My media stocks under-performed
because of people like you.

11:19.915 --> 11:22.083
My brother lost his job
as a grip

11:22.117 --> 11:24.419
on a movie set
because of piracy.

11:24.453 --> 11:26.687
He had to sell his Jet Ski.

11:26.722 --> 11:29.590
A grip without a Jet Ski
ain't no grip at all!

11:29.625 --> 11:30.792
(yelling)

11:33.629 --> 11:35.897
You're about to find out

11:35.931 --> 11:39.100
what we do to
copyright infringers.

11:39.134 --> 11:40.101
(yelling)

11:40.135 --> 11:41.736
(tires screech)

11:44.206 --> 11:45.206

11:49.845 --> 11:50.978

in distance)

11:51.013 --> 11:52.080
Uh... huh?

11:52.114 --> 11:53.781
(horn blowing)
Huh...? (screams)

11:55.117 --> 11:57.351
(men yelling)

11:57.386 --> 11:59.520
(grunting)

12:03.158 --> 12:04.859
(screams)

12:08.163 --> 12:09.263
Whoo-hoo!

12:20.209 --> 12:21.976
It's almost
like having Dad here.

12:22.010 --> 12:24.645
Only with less growling
when I go near his food.

12:24.680 --> 12:27.115
I just want to know who
dropped the dime on Dad.

12:27.149 --> 12:28.616
Lousy rat.

12:28.650 --> 12:30.985
Maybe the person
that turned your father in

12:31.019 --> 12:33.488
thought they were doing
the right thing.

12:33.522 --> 12:35.156
Homer just pirated a movie.

12:35.190 --> 12:37.191
But it's not the worst thing
Dad ever did.

12:37.226 --> 12:39.927
It's not even the worst kind
of pirate Dad's ever been.

12:39.962 --> 12:41.262
Lisa, tell your brother

12:41.296 --> 12:42.997
that stealing is wrong,
no matter what.

12:43.031 --> 12:44.332
I don't know.

12:44.366 --> 12:46.634
It wasn't like Dad was
stealing for himself.

12:46.668 --> 12:49.337
He created this wonderful
experience for the whole town.

12:49.371 --> 12:52.707
I just can't imagine
anyone turning him in.

12:56.044 --> 12:57.345
(door creaking open)

12:57.379 --> 12:58.940
Dad, Dad, you're back, you're back!
Hey!

12:58.947 --> 13:00.848
Dad, you're back! Dad!

13:00.883 --> 13:03.117
Homer, what are you doing
out of prison?

13:03.152 --> 13:05.586
You have to go back
and give yourself up.

13:05.621 --> 13:07.588
I can't go back to jail!

13:07.623 --> 13:10.491
There's no shampoo, just soap!

13:10.526 --> 13:12.793
Wait, I know one place
in Springfield

13:12.828 --> 13:16.531
that doesn't care
about Internet piracy laws.

13:19.735 --> 13:21.068
Thanks for taking us in.

13:21.103 --> 13:23.838
Our family always
appreciates asylum.

13:23.872 --> 13:27.275
This consulate is
like being on Swedish soil.

13:27.309 --> 13:30.511
You're as safe here as you would
be in the Skatteskrapan.

13:30.546 --> 13:31.746
(whistles)

13:31.780 --> 13:33.581
Your country
doesn't think illegally

13:33.615 --> 13:35.816
downloading movies is wrong?

13:35.851 --> 13:37.185
The people of Sweden believe

13:37.219 --> 13:38.886
all movies should
be shared freely.

13:38.921 --> 13:41.155
How is that not stealing?

13:41.190 --> 13:44.258
Bah, your Hollywood studios
are the real thieves,

13:44.293 --> 13:47.195
claiming all their hit movies
have lost money.

13:47.229 --> 13:49.897
I spit on their bookkeeping.

13:49.932 --> 13:52.767
Yeah, and why don't they
make a sequel to <i>Taken</i>

13:52.801 --> 13:54.769
where <i>The Hangover</i> guys
get taken

13:54.803 --> 13:56.370
and the only ones
that could rescue them

13:56.405 --> 13:57.939
is <i>Fast and Furious.</i>

13:57.973 --> 14:00.841
Aw, man, I would
love to pirate that.

14:00.876 --> 14:03.678
As would
the proud people of Sweden.

14:03.712 --> 14:05.246
(sirens blaring)

14:05.280 --> 14:07.081
(tires screeching)

14:09.685 --> 14:11.085
They've found us!

14:11.119 --> 14:13.387
There's only one surefire way
to get fugitives

14:13.422 --> 14:15.056
out of a foreign building--

14:15.090 --> 14:17.124
blasting death metal.

14:30.339 --> 14:33.474

14:33.508 --> 14:37.111
Damn those Peace Prize-giving

14:39.014 --> 14:42.750
I'm so tired of being trapped
in this embassy.

14:42.784 --> 14:44.118
Consulate.

14:44.152 --> 14:45.786
Consulates are regional offices,

14:45.821 --> 14:48.122
which serve the embassy
in the capitol.

14:49.825 --> 14:51.158
Thank you so much
for sticking with me

14:51.193 --> 14:52.460
through all this.

It was me!

14:58.433 --> 15:00.735
I was the one who
told the FBI.

15:02.304 --> 15:03.271
You?

15:03.305 --> 15:04.705
How could you?

15:04.740 --> 15:06.641
You're my own flesh and blood.

15:06.675 --> 15:09.410
I was just trying

15:09.444 --> 15:11.312
Who would've thought
the authorities

15:11.346 --> 15:13.547
would use a confession
against me?

15:13.582 --> 15:16.917
Have you forgotten what you
promised at our wedding?

15:16.952 --> 15:18.419
To love and cherish?

15:18.453 --> 15:19.920
To aid and abet?

15:19.955 --> 15:22.757
I never wanted
to say funny vows.

15:22.791 --> 15:24.659
Well, you did!
And they got laughs.

15:24.693 --> 15:26.427
Solid laughs!

The people call Hollywood
ultra-producer, Judd Apatow.

16:13.141 --> 16:15.810
Homer Simpson is
an enemy of art.

16:15.844 --> 16:18.045
Art created by writers,
directors,

16:18.080 --> 16:21.649

of illegal reproduction
and distribution

16:52.314 --> 16:54.048

16:54.082 --> 16:56.384
Before sentencing, do you have
anything to say for yourself?

16:56.418 --> 16:57.167
No.

16:57.192 --> 16:59.877
Homer, tell them
your side of the story.

17:00.489 --> 17:03.391
I know I hurt you,
but please trust me now.

17:03.425 --> 17:05.726
It'll work.

17:05.761 --> 17:08.061
You know what, Judge Apatow?

17:08.096 --> 17:10.498
I do have something to say.

17:10.531 --> 17:13.032
These movie people
may say I'm a pirate,

17:13.068 --> 17:14.568
but I'm just a man.

17:14.603 --> 17:17.104
A man who loved Hollywood
too much.

17:17.138 --> 17:19.973
So I made my own rules
and fought the big guys

17:20.008 --> 17:22.542
who tried to destroy
my way of life.

17:22.577 --> 17:24.011
He doesn't sound
like a villain.

17:24.045 --> 17:25.613
He sounds
like a classic underdog.

17:25.646 --> 17:27.548
He's the unlikeliest
of heroes!

17:27.582 --> 17:29.550
But where's
the love story?

17:29.584 --> 17:31.352
At first my wife
didn't believe in me.

17:31.386 --> 17:34.755
Maybe we forgot why we fell
in love in the first place.

17:34.790 --> 17:37.425
But when times seemed darkest,
one minute ago,

17:37.459 --> 17:40.895
she was there and gave me
the strength and courage

17:40.929 --> 17:44.532
to fight for what I believe in.

17:44.566 --> 17:47.334
He's a downloading David
versus a greedy Goliath.

17:47.369 --> 17:50.337
An Erin Brockovich
but with more cleavage!

17:50.372 --> 17:52.573
Two, three... Good
Lord, he's hitting

17:52.607 --> 17:54.875
all four quadrants!

17:54.910 --> 17:58.045
One family, against all odds,
took on the system...

17:58.079 --> 18:00.014
and lost.

18:00.048 --> 18:01.582

We envision a trilogy.

18:11.593 --> 18:13.534
Will Smith's family wants

18:22.304 --> 18:23.971
These people hate my dad.

18:24.005 --> 18:26.640
How can they want
to make a movie about him?

18:26.675 --> 18:28.642
Hollywood may be run
by big corporations

18:28.677 --> 18:31.178
trying to squash people,
but they make movies

18:31.213 --> 18:33.447
about people standing up
to big corporations

18:33.482 --> 18:35.749
trying to squash them
and winning.

18:35.784 --> 18:38.752
I'll sign with whoever
can convince Channing Tatum

18:38.787 --> 18:41.388

to play me.

18:47.462 --> 18:50.431
Surprise! - Surprise!
Surprise!

18:50.465 --> 18:51.932
What the hell
is all this?

18:51.967 --> 18:53.300
We're so excited
about your movie

18:53.335 --> 18:55.135
that we're having
a special screening.

18:55.170 --> 18:57.605
But the movie isn't in theaters
till next week.

18:57.639 --> 18:59.607
Yeah, we ripped a version
off Bootleg Bay

18:59.641 --> 19:01.208
just like you taught us.

19:01.243 --> 19:02.543
It's still got timecode on it,

19:02.577 --> 19:04.945
but, otherwise,
it's a clean copy.

19:04.980 --> 19:06.447

Piracy is stealing!

19:11.386 --> 19:14.889

19:14.923 --> 19:16.323

19:19.060 --> 19:20.895
Oh, that's Hollywood fantasy.

19:36.077 --> 19:37.912
No bargain matinees!

19:37.946 --> 19:40.114
And tell your friends
it was great!

19:40.148 --> 19:43.183
Buy the stuff they advertise
in the commercials before it!

19:43.218 --> 19:46.053
Homer in the movie
wears Ask Body Spray

19:46.087 --> 19:47.988
and so should you!

19:48.023 --> 19:50.424
Don't ask! Do smell!

19:50.458 --> 19:52.052
Homie, do you really think
you should be...

19:52.077 --> 19:53.260
Up-bup-bup-bup-bup!

19:53.261 --> 19:56.897
What have we learned about not
blindly supporting our husband?

19:56.932 --> 19:59.266
Ask Body Spray!

20:14.595 --> 20:16.329
But then when times
seemed darkest,

20:16.363 --> 20:19.032
she was there; she gave me
the strength and courage

20:19.066 --> 20:21.000
to fight for what I believe in.

20:21.035 --> 20:23.002
On behalf of Hollywood,

20:23.037 --> 20:26.673
we're dropping all charges!

20:26.707 --> 20:28.141
(cheering)

20:29.443 --> 20:31.811
(laughing)

20:31.845 --> 20:34.080
So what do you think, Lise?
Who are the good guys here,

20:34.114 --> 20:36.950
the media companies or
the Internet freedom guys?

20:36.984 --> 20:39.285
Well, both groups claim
their intentions are noble,

20:39.320 --> 20:41.955
but at the end of the day,
they're both trying to steal

20:41.989 --> 20:43.823
as much money as they can.

20:43.857 --> 20:46.092
So... everyone's a pirate?

20:46.126 --> 20:47.860
And the worst one of all is...

21:28.636 --> 21:31.437
(Seth Rogen laughing)

21:32.613 --> 21:34.614
Shh!

21:35.305 --> 21:41.398
