WEBVTT

00:01.125 --> 00:03.394
Oh! Oh.

00:03.519 --> 00:05.319
Good morn-ing.

00:05.363 --> 00:08.031
- Hmm.
- Oh.

00:08.099 --> 00:09.699
How did I spend
my summer vacation?

00:09.723 --> 00:11.190
I got over my breakup with Andy.

00:11.197 --> 00:13.031
I got a job
at Grandpa's country club.

00:13.099 --> 00:14.933
- I got mono.
- Too close!

00:15.001 --> 00:17.069
Put your mask on!

00:17.136 --> 00:19.571
No one misses two weeks
at Caltech and catches up.

00:19.639 --> 00:20.973
What am I gonna do?

00:21.040 --> 00:22.241
Well, honey,
I think you need to focus

00:22.308 --> 00:23.709
on getting
a little bit stronger,

00:23.776 --> 00:25.811
a little bit healthier
and just a little farther.

00:25.878 --> 00:28.547
How do nerds even get mono?

00:28.615 --> 00:30.682
Did you all practice
by kissing the same pillow?

00:30.750 --> 00:31.750
Shouldn't you be at work by now?

00:32.418 --> 00:34.086
I got fired.

00:34.153 --> 00:36.188
My plan was to hide it from my
parents until I got a new job,

00:36.256 --> 00:37.656
but with smarty-pants Alex home,

00:37.724 --> 00:40.392
I had to be more careful, or
she was going to figure it out.

00:40.460 --> 00:43.595
Her being super-sick is coming
at a really bad time for me.

00:43.663 --> 00:46.031
You got in late last night, huh?

00:46.099 --> 00:47.366
Yeah. It was payday,

00:47.433 --> 00:49.234
and a game of craps
broke out in the kitchen.

00:49.302 --> 00:51.802
See this watch?
Enrique's grandfather's.

00:51.870 --> 00:54.473
You're giving it back, and
remember, the second that job

00:54.540 --> 00:56.141
interferes with your grades,
you're done.

00:56.209 --> 00:57.576
Did you finish
your history report?

00:57.644 --> 00:59.478
Just got to dot the I's
and cross the T's...

00:59.545 --> 01:01.813
and put in
all the other letters.

01:01.881 --> 01:02.714
It's okay, everybody!

01:02.782 --> 01:05.684
I'm alive!

01:07.787 --> 01:12.057
I had a traumatic experience
after an open house.

01:12.125 --> 01:14.526
Have a good one.

01:30.677 --> 01:32.778
Oh, no.

01:43.990 --> 01:46.958
Aaaaaaah.

01:52.532 --> 01:56.468
Monday lunch, Monday dinner.

01:56.536 --> 02:00.806
Tuesday
breakfast, Tuesday lunch.

02:07.113 --> 02:08.312
Welcome home.

02:08.381 --> 02:10.816
Open house went great.
Lots of interested buyers.

02:10.883 --> 02:14.553
Fun fact -- Some stranger,
probably a long time ago,

02:14.620 --> 02:15.721
wrote
their last will and testament

02:15.788 --> 02:16.888
right here on your wall.

02:16.956 --> 02:19.791
Trust me on this.

02:21.661 --> 02:23.628
Did nobody notice
I was gone for 18 hours?

02:23.696 --> 02:25.097
Why aren't you all
making posters?

02:25.164 --> 02:26.198
I figured
you were in your office.

02:26.265 --> 02:28.333
I went to bed
really early last night,

02:28.401 --> 02:29.835
and when I woke up this morning,
I thought you'd gone for a run.

02:29.902 --> 02:33.338
Alex?
I can't believe this!

02:33.406 --> 02:36.341
Well, honey, the important
thing is that you are okay.

02:36.409 --> 02:38.210
Now, I'm very sorry,
but I've got to get to work.

02:38.277 --> 02:40.946
We are bidding a big job
against my old nemesis,

02:41.013 --> 02:43.014
Closets, Closets,
Closets, Closets.

02:43.082 --> 02:44.516
I'm back in there.

02:58.297 --> 02:59.831
I want to live outside.

02:59.899 --> 03:02.167
No, Señor, we're not having
that argument anymore.

03:02.235 --> 03:03.335
Mowgli lives outside.

03:03.403 --> 03:05.837
Is Mowgli
that dirty kid at his preschool

03:05.905 --> 03:08.340
whose parents drive the car
that runs on French fry oil?

03:08.408 --> 03:11.343
No. It's that dirty kid that
runs around <i>The Jungle Book.</i>

03:11.411 --> 03:12.978
Jay, tell him he can't.

03:13.045 --> 03:15.881
First time I saw <i>Tarzan,</i>
I wanted to live outside.

03:15.948 --> 03:18.850
Dad said fine. I walked
in the woods, met a hobo.

03:18.918 --> 03:21.153
Taught me how to open a can
with a bird's beak.

03:21.220 --> 03:23.054
That story's not helping!

03:23.122 --> 03:24.189
I'm doing it.

03:24.257 --> 03:24.823
No! Jay!

03:24.891 --> 03:26.892
Of course not.

03:26.959 --> 03:27.826
Why learn self-reliance
when the industrial machine

03:27.894 --> 03:30.395
depends on constant consumption?

03:30.463 --> 03:32.664
No eggs for me.
I'll be having porridge.

03:32.732 --> 03:34.566
Are you really still doing this?

03:34.634 --> 03:37.702
Over the summer, I went to a
wedding in Juárez and met Frida,

03:37.770 --> 03:39.271
this amazing girl
who enlightened me

03:39.338 --> 03:40.939
to how Communism
can rid the world of injustice.

03:41.007 --> 03:44.876
Mm.
What a beautiful reception.

03:44.944 --> 03:46.711
Yeah.

03:46.779 --> 03:48.780
Oh, right.
That's a bad thing.

03:48.848 --> 03:50.949
I live simply now,
and it's good for me.

03:51.017 --> 03:54.219
Might it also help my chance
of kissing her one day? Yes.

03:54.287 --> 03:55.954
And if that requires
living in a world

03:56.022 --> 03:58.790
where the government
chooses all our songs, so be it.

03:58.858 --> 04:00.058
I'm gonna take a coffee

04:00.126 --> 04:01.893
to the guy putting up
the security cameras.

04:01.961 --> 04:04.663
It's not <i>coffee</i> the laborers
need, Jay. It's <i>dignity.</i>

04:04.730 --> 04:05.864
And I'm going to fight for that

04:05.932 --> 04:07.732
until my fingers are raw
and my back is bent.

04:07.800 --> 04:10.101
Six months ago, we took you
to the dermatologist

04:10.169 --> 04:12.204
for taking
too many bubble baths.

04:13.805 --> 04:15.707
- Brought you this.
- Oh, thanks.

04:15.775 --> 04:17.909
- Almost done here.
- Take your time.

04:17.976 --> 04:19.911
Important thing is...

04:21.814 --> 04:23.748
Oh, no.

04:23.816 --> 04:25.217
Guess what.

04:25.284 --> 04:27.118
A black family's moving in
right across the street

04:27.186 --> 04:29.354
the same day my security
cameras are going up.

04:29.422 --> 04:30.722
Well, what am I supposed to do?

04:30.790 --> 04:32.224
I made the appointment weeks ago

04:32.291 --> 04:34.125
right after the break-in
down the street.

04:34.193 --> 04:36.561
But they'll think I made
the call the minute I saw them

04:36.629 --> 04:38.230
because I'm a racist old man.

04:38.297 --> 04:40.799
Why would the neighbors just
assume that you're a racist?

04:40.867 --> 04:42.634
Gloria, Gloria, Gloria.

04:42.702 --> 04:46.471
You'll never understand the
stereotypes old white men face.

04:46.539 --> 04:48.773
Goal!

04:48.841 --> 04:50.108
Nice shot, Tom.

04:50.176 --> 04:51.676
Do you want to play with us?

04:51.744 --> 04:53.278
You know, I'm off
contact sports right now.

04:53.346 --> 04:55.080
I twisted my ankle
playing running charades,

04:55.147 --> 04:57.616
but you two should get ready
for dance class.

04:57.683 --> 04:59.784
Okay, go.
Go, go, go!

04:59.852 --> 05:02.087
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:03.356 --> 05:05.090
Okay, why do you
look so satisfied?

05:05.157 --> 05:06.424
Did you just listen
to an NPR story

05:06.492 --> 05:07.192
that proved you right
about something?

05:07.260 --> 05:09.127
No, no, but you know Tom,

05:09.195 --> 05:10.562
the friend
that Lily's playing with?

05:10.630 --> 05:13.097
Well, I know of him. We haven't
formally been introduced.

05:13.164 --> 05:17.335
Well, it turns out that Tom
used to identify as... Tina.

05:17.403 --> 05:19.404
Oh, I wish
you wouldn't have told me.

05:19.472 --> 05:21.940
You know how proud I am
of my gender identificadar.

05:22.008 --> 05:24.276
Well, Tom's been having
some problems at school,

05:24.343 --> 05:26.745
and -- and Lily has been
really respectful of him.

05:26.812 --> 05:28.647
Oh, she is so sweet.

05:28.714 --> 05:29.714
She really is.

05:29.782 --> 05:31.650
She gets all the credit
on this one.

05:31.717 --> 05:33.351
Uh-huh.

05:33.419 --> 05:36.021
This so doesn't matter.

05:36.088 --> 05:37.789
We raised her
to have an open mind.

05:37.857 --> 05:40.292
Totally.
We deserve some kudos here, too.

05:40.359 --> 05:42.093
There's enough kudos
for everyone.

05:42.161 --> 05:44.162
You know, a kudo would be an excellent
name for a parenting award.

05:45.230 --> 05:47.130
Oh, thank you, Gwyneth.

05:47.998 --> 05:50.469
Lily, if you're still watching,
go to bed.

05:50.837 --> 05:52.804
Get out of here, you weirdo!

05:58.830 --> 06:01.164
Part of being the boss
is being a bummer.

06:05.670 --> 06:09.240
It was hard at first,
but I've learned to accept it...

06:09.307 --> 06:10.608
mostly.

06:10.675 --> 06:14.078
It's really been -- Oh.

06:14.145 --> 06:16.447
Margaret,
you knew I was in here.

06:16.515 --> 06:18.048
Sorry.
I just had some messages.

06:18.516 --> 06:20.718
Luke's guidance counselor --

06:20.785 --> 06:22.486
Luke fell asleep in class again.

06:22.553 --> 06:24.855
Haley's car payment is late.

06:24.923 --> 06:26.323
And the credit-card company.

06:26.391 --> 06:27.491
Phil made a large purchase

06:27.559 --> 06:32.062
on a Tibetan website
called CopingCandles.com.

06:32.130 --> 06:33.663
Tell the creative team
to get their giggles out.

06:33.731 --> 06:35.232
I'll be ready for them in 10.

06:35.300 --> 06:37.668
But when you've been the bummer
all day at work,

06:37.736 --> 06:41.038
you don't love having to be
the bummer at home, too.

06:41.106 --> 06:43.773
Hi, honey. Is your brother
around? I need to yell at him.

06:43.841 --> 06:45.075
Of course he's around.

06:45.143 --> 06:46.544
Why would he leave me in peace

06:46.611 --> 06:48.045
to do some work
at the kitchen table

06:48.113 --> 06:49.680
when he could
just barge in and --

06:49.748 --> 06:51.081
Luke! Game down!

06:51.149 --> 06:52.383
This is your senior year,

06:52.450 --> 06:54.285
also known
as your last year to not suck.

06:54.352 --> 06:57.354
- Honey.
- Dad, you hit "place order" once,

06:57.422 --> 06:59.056
and then you wait
for the confirmation.

06:59.124 --> 07:01.225
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry! Be smart!

07:01.293 --> 07:02.893
That angry screeching

07:02.961 --> 07:04.895
was the sweet sound
of my new home bummer.

07:04.963 --> 07:07.998
I'm just so tired
and in pain and irritable.

07:08.066 --> 07:10.200
It just makes me so mad
at everyone.

07:10.268 --> 07:12.736
Sorry for yelling, Mom.
Why were you calling again?

07:12.804 --> 07:14.538
I forgot.

07:14.606 --> 07:17.374
Damn it, Mom!
Write it down next time!

07:18.842 --> 07:20.044
All right.

07:20.812 --> 07:22.513
Here we are.

07:22.581 --> 07:24.915
Okay. Don't forget to give
Funkmaster Linda her check

07:24.983 --> 07:26.250
for today's class.

07:26.318 --> 07:27.751
- Bye, Tom.
- Bye, Tom.

07:27.819 --> 07:29.620
Hey, Lily.
Can you hang back a second?

07:29.688 --> 07:32.556
I shouldn't. Linda says
being late is wiggity-wack.

07:32.624 --> 07:34.959
We just want to know
why you called Tom a weirdo

07:35.026 --> 07:36.260
back at the house.

07:36.328 --> 07:37.361
I don't know.

07:37.429 --> 07:38.562
Okay, well, we don't
make fun of people

07:38.630 --> 07:39.964
who are different, okay?

07:40.031 --> 07:41.966
- You know how hard it was
for Daddy and me? - Yeah.

07:42.033 --> 07:43.867
Growing up in Missouri,
I was so mistreated

07:43.934 --> 07:45.369
that one of my best friends
was an old scarecrow

07:45.437 --> 07:46.637
I found in the creek.

07:46.705 --> 07:48.038
Some of your stories
would be more impactful

07:48.106 --> 07:49.239
with fewer details.

07:49.307 --> 07:51.208
Fine. I won't do it again.
Can I go now?

07:51.276 --> 07:53.644
Okay, but -- but do you understand
why what you did is wrong?

07:53.712 --> 07:55.112
Yes!

07:55.180 --> 07:57.381
Well, this bothers me.

07:57.449 --> 07:59.183
They're getting along great,
and then one little spat,

07:59.250 --> 08:01.385
and her instinct
is to go all baby bigot on him?

08:01.453 --> 08:03.020
Well --
and I say this with love --

08:03.088 --> 08:06.190
she did just get back
from spending a full summer

08:06.257 --> 08:08.525
with your family in Missouri.

08:08.593 --> 08:10.794
Oh. So we're blaming
my family, then?

08:10.862 --> 08:13.297
I'm -- I'm just saying maybe
when she gets back from there,

08:13.365 --> 08:14.965
she needs to be reminded
of our values.

08:15.033 --> 08:16.866
You know -- un-hick her.

08:16.934 --> 08:18.802
Oh, the H-bomb!

08:18.870 --> 08:20.537
Possibly the most offensive slur

08:20.605 --> 08:22.106
ever thrown around in the South.

08:22.173 --> 08:23.774
Well... y--

08:23.842 --> 08:25.376
Look,
I-I love those people, too,

08:25.443 --> 08:26.577
but you did just admit

08:26.645 --> 08:28.212
they can be a little
close-minded down there.

08:28.279 --> 08:30.314
Well, they are a little bit
set in their ways.

08:30.382 --> 08:32.448
It was actually illegal to run
for mayor without a mustache

08:32.517 --> 08:33.717
- until 1980.
- See? It's --

08:33.784 --> 08:36.186
- And then again from '82 to '85.
- Okay.

08:37.489 --> 08:38.989
Input.

08:39.057 --> 08:41.525
Input!

08:41.592 --> 08:43.827
Please don't throw
the remote again.

08:43.895 --> 08:46.630
Oh, I was just, like,
trying to get signal.

08:46.698 --> 08:49.767
Don't blame me about
breaking the other ones.

08:49.834 --> 08:51.068
One got stepped on,

08:51.136 --> 08:53.837
and the other one
fell down the garbage disposal.

08:53.905 --> 08:55.072
You're not even trying.

08:55.140 --> 08:57.341
Anyways, stop worrying
about the remote control

08:57.409 --> 08:58.708
and worry about your own dog.

08:58.776 --> 09:00.377
She's peeing in the corner.

09:00.545 --> 09:01.912
Maybe if you ever
leave her outside,

09:01.980 --> 09:04.982
she will guard us,
and we wouldn't need cameras.

09:05.050 --> 09:06.984
First of all, Stella's
not peeing in the corner,

09:07.052 --> 09:08.385
because I housebroke her myself.

09:08.453 --> 09:11.588
Second of all, no dog of mine
should ever have to work.

09:11.656 --> 09:13.323
There he is.
There's my old pal.

09:13.391 --> 09:14.692
- Jay.
- How you doing, huh?

09:14.759 --> 09:16.360
I'm so glad you called.

09:16.428 --> 09:18.862
I haven't been good about seeing
people since Reynetta left.

09:18.930 --> 09:20.798
Did you hear?
She started dating my brother!

09:20.865 --> 09:22.833
Listen, it's such a nice day.
Let's go outside.

09:22.901 --> 09:25.169
Isn't your backyard nicer?

09:25.236 --> 09:25.936
Nah.
It's all pool and chairs.

09:26.004 --> 09:28.472
So, how you been, buddy?

09:28.540 --> 09:31.041
I want to tell you everything
is okay so you won't worry,

09:31.109 --> 09:33.644
- but things have been real bad.
- You know what might help?

09:33.712 --> 09:35.612
You pop that hat off, you get
a little sun on your face.

09:35.680 --> 09:38.248
Ooh!
The sun is rough on my eyes.

09:38.316 --> 09:41.218
I cry almost every day.

09:41.286 --> 09:43.887
Pretty much, the only time I'm
happy is when I clean my gun.

09:43.954 --> 09:45.089
Yeah, life, huh?
Here, give me a hug.

09:45.156 --> 09:46.256
- There you go.
- Oh.

09:46.324 --> 09:48.659
- There you go.
- You're a good friend, Jay.

09:48.727 --> 09:50.994
You got your own problems,
but you're right there for me.

09:51.062 --> 09:53.230
Damn it!

09:53.298 --> 09:56.033
Why do you need them to know
you have a black friend?

09:56.101 --> 09:58.335
I'm putting security cameras in
the same day they move in.

09:58.403 --> 10:01.771
I'm mad about that,
but it feels good to be held.

10:01.839 --> 10:04.208
Come here.
Come here.

10:05.577 --> 10:08.545
Flashbacks,
nightmares, anxiety --

10:08.613 --> 10:10.247
My imprisonment in the closet

10:10.315 --> 10:12.883
resulted in all the symptoms
of PTSD.

10:20.024 --> 10:22.926
My insurance company
helped me to find a therapy dog

10:22.994 --> 10:24.461
and agreed to cover everything,

10:24.529 --> 10:27.131
and then they found out
I wasn't in the military.

10:34.872 --> 10:36.607
Oh, boy.

10:41.246 --> 10:46.016
Hey, Alex, honey, could you
help me reset the router?!

10:52.257 --> 10:54.825
Oh! No.

11:02.700 --> 11:05.969
Bad luck!
Bad luck!!

11:10.675 --> 11:12.809
Alex's laptop
had every piece of homework

11:12.876 --> 11:14.478
she ever did in high school.

11:14.546 --> 11:16.113
It was the Holy Grail...

11:16.181 --> 11:17.815
I think.

11:17.882 --> 11:19.283
Thanks to Alex's hard work,

11:19.350 --> 11:21.985
I don't know what that is
and never will.

11:24.923 --> 11:27.191
Not again!

11:28.860 --> 11:30.494
Oh, Dad,
I didn't know you were home.

11:30.562 --> 11:31.595
Haley, thank God.

11:31.663 --> 11:33.030
Could you reset
the router for me?

11:33.097 --> 11:35.532
I would, but I took
a late lunch from work,

11:35.600 --> 11:36.900
which I have
to get back to work.

11:36.968 --> 11:38.335
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

11:38.403 --> 11:40.470
I think I'm just
hyperventilating.

11:40.538 --> 11:44.407
Should pass in
like 20 minutes or s-so.

11:44.475 --> 11:46.677
Okay, well, I'm gonna head back.

11:46.744 --> 11:48.511
Wouldn't want
to be consistently late

11:47.979 --> 11:50.280
and get fired, right?

11:52.483 --> 11:54.084
Alex, honey.

11:59.858 --> 12:00.991
Good girl.

12:01.059 --> 12:03.627
Good girl.

12:03.695 --> 12:05.629
Input!
I know you can hear me

12:05.697 --> 12:07.197
because I can see
your green light!

12:07.265 --> 12:08.832
It's like one of those videos
where the pit bull

12:08.900 --> 12:10.033
swims with the baby chick.

12:10.101 --> 12:12.369
You just know
something bad's gonna happen.

12:12.437 --> 12:14.805
Where are your keys?
I need the jumper cables.

12:14.873 --> 12:17.341
- What happened?
- I spent the last hour in my car,

12:17.408 --> 12:18.976
listening to the Commodores
with my windows down,

12:19.043 --> 12:20.878
and the neighbors
didn't even come outside.

12:23.615 --> 12:27.084
That must be your good friends
the Harlem Globetrotters.

12:27.151 --> 12:29.086
- Hey.
- Hey!

12:29.153 --> 12:30.554
Gloria invited us
to sit by the pool

12:30.622 --> 12:32.256
till we have
to pick up Lily at hip-hop.

12:32.323 --> 12:34.791
My Asian granddaughter
takes a hip-hop class?

12:34.859 --> 12:37.127
Why are we not talking
about this in the front yard?

12:37.195 --> 12:38.762
We brought cupcakes.
Manny, cupcake?

12:38.830 --> 12:41.098
Oh, I see. Fill my mouth
with bourgie opiates

12:41.165 --> 12:43.600
- so I can't speak for the people?
- That was a lot.

12:43.668 --> 12:46.270
He's trying to get
a Communist girl to kiss him.

12:46.337 --> 12:47.738
We have our own kid problems.

12:47.805 --> 12:49.706
I mean, we had
an incident this afternoon

12:49.774 --> 12:51.775
during Lily's playdate with Tom,

12:51.843 --> 12:53.976
who used to identify as...
Tina.

12:54.044 --> 12:56.179
I don't totally get
the hand thing, but I like it.

12:56.247 --> 12:59.249
They had a fight, and Lily
said the worst possible thing.

12:59.317 --> 13:01.684
- I mean, that poor boy's
been through enough. - Mm.

13:01.752 --> 13:04.755
Oh, I am sure that the parents
have gone through a lot, too.

13:04.822 --> 13:06.290
Sure.
You just don't get comfortable

13:06.357 --> 13:07.891
with something like that
overnight.

13:07.959 --> 13:09.960
Let me ask you guys something.

13:10.028 --> 13:13.297
If, someday,
Lily wanted to be Lou

13:13.364 --> 13:15.933
and had the whole
chop-chop, bing-bang thing,

13:16.000 --> 13:17.301
how would you be with that?

13:17.368 --> 13:19.236
- We love Lily.
- Lou.

13:19.304 --> 13:20.570
- We love Lou.
- Mm-hmm.

13:20.638 --> 13:22.406
- And there's nothing she could do --
- He.

13:22.473 --> 13:24.841
- He.- There's nothing <i>he</i> could do
that would change that.

13:24.908 --> 13:28.811
So you wouldn't even need the
minute that Tom's parents did?

13:28.879 --> 13:30.314
Well, no, no.
Maybe a minute.

13:30.381 --> 13:31.748
I mean, there'd -- there'd be
a lot of things

13:31.816 --> 13:33.517
that I'd be giving up
that I've always imagined doing,

13:33.584 --> 13:36.018
like -- like walking her down
the aisle in her wedding dress.

13:36.086 --> 13:37.421
Or whispering
in her husband's ear

13:37.488 --> 13:38.822
that he'll never replace me.

13:38.890 --> 13:40.723
Well, that's interesting,
because the minute it took me

13:40.791 --> 13:42.626
to accept the fact that my son

13:42.694 --> 13:45.595
was living a different kind of life
than the one that I anticipated,

13:45.663 --> 13:48.699
Mitchell called me
an old, straight, white bigot.

13:48.766 --> 13:53.637
And now you're just like me.

13:53.705 --> 13:55.339
Oh, my God, Mitchell.
Are we where Lily gets it?

13:55.406 --> 13:57.040
Are we not as open-minded
as we think?

13:57.108 --> 13:59.543
But that's our thing -- lording
our tolerance over others.

13:59.610 --> 14:01.144
I guess what this proves is,

14:01.212 --> 14:03.013
there's a little bit
of prejudice in everyone --

14:03.081 --> 14:04.114
you, me,

14:04.182 --> 14:05.515
the neighbor across the street

14:05.583 --> 14:06.917
judging me for my cameras.

14:06.985 --> 14:08.752
I'm gonna do what I should
have done at the beginning --

14:08.820 --> 14:10.320
- talk to them.
- That's not a good idea.

14:10.388 --> 14:11.288
Watch me!

14:13.458 --> 14:15.926
Joe, you're not going
to live outside!

14:15.994 --> 14:18.128
Fine!

14:31.000 --> 14:33.103
Alex is never away
from her laptop,

14:33.177 --> 14:35.512
so I had to steal assignments
one at a time.

14:35.580 --> 14:37.514
I'm not proud of stealing,

14:37.582 --> 14:40.217
but I'm not unproud
of <i>how</i> I'm stealing.

14:50.061 --> 14:52.896
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry,

14:52.964 --> 14:56.733
but now that you're awake,
what happened in here, huh?

14:56.801 --> 14:59.102
I'll tell you
what happened here --

14:59.170 --> 15:02.839
the same thing that's been
happening all damn day!

15:02.907 --> 15:05.842
Me dealing with animals
who don't care

15:05.910 --> 15:08.512
that we are air-conditioning
the outside

15:08.579 --> 15:10.414
and insist
on rotting their brains

15:10.481 --> 15:13.850
by watching vapid housewives
spit wine on each other.

15:13.918 --> 15:18.488
And you. Can't even be bothered
to use a plate!

15:20.792 --> 15:22.392
Oh, she's a bummer, huh?

15:24.762 --> 15:26.063
Something funny?

15:26.130 --> 15:27.397
No.

15:27.465 --> 15:29.266
What are you even doing home?

15:29.333 --> 15:31.068
Don't you cat-sit for your boss
on Tuesday nights?

15:31.135 --> 15:32.702
Uhhhhhh...

15:32.770 --> 15:34.738
Alex, maybe you'd feel better
if we went for a walk

15:34.806 --> 15:36.506
or a ride in the car, huh?
Go for a ride in the car!

15:36.574 --> 15:39.009
You know what? There are
just too many distractions here.

15:39.077 --> 15:41.578
I don't care how sick I am.
I have to go back to college.

15:41.646 --> 15:42.746
- No! - No!
- No!

15:42.814 --> 15:45.549
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Of course you do!

15:45.616 --> 15:46.817
Was I the kind of person

15:46.884 --> 15:48.652
who would send her sick sister
back to school

15:48.719 --> 15:51.655
just to keep her
from figuring out I got fired?

15:51.722 --> 15:53.990
Did I use her laptop to get
through community college?

15:54.058 --> 15:57.661
Let's get you back there.
It's Friday night.

15:57.728 --> 15:59.596
Maybe there's a party
you can listen to.

16:00.943 --> 16:02.643
- Excuse me.
- Hello.

16:02.667 --> 16:03.467
I don't mean to bug you.

16:03.482 --> 16:05.317
You're just moving in.
I'm right across the street.

16:05.380 --> 16:06.847
- Listen.
- Let me stop you.

16:06.955 --> 16:08.422
You had the cameras scheduled,

16:08.489 --> 16:10.123
worried about how it would look,

16:10.191 --> 16:13.126
brought your black friend out,
blasted Commodores.

16:13.194 --> 16:14.761
It's not my first time

16:14.829 --> 16:17.064
moving into
a white neighborhood.

16:17.131 --> 16:19.165
- We're good.
- Yeah?

16:19.233 --> 16:22.401
I did my residency
in New Hampshire.

16:22.469 --> 16:24.805
All right. Listen, you guys
need anything, let me know.

16:24.872 --> 16:27.474
You got it.
I'm Shawn, by the way.

16:27.542 --> 16:28.775
- Jay Pritchett.
- Jay.

16:28.843 --> 16:31.278
It's okay, Gloria.
All handled.

16:31.346 --> 16:32.746
This is my wife, Gloria.

16:32.814 --> 16:34.815
This is Shawn --
and I want to get this right,

16:34.882 --> 16:38.552
beautiful African name --
Shawn M'badawe.

16:38.620 --> 16:42.789
I said, "By the way."

16:42.857 --> 16:46.526
Ah.

16:47.184 --> 16:49.018
Hey, Lily.
We need to talk.

16:49.086 --> 16:50.954
I was actually just heading out.

16:51.021 --> 16:52.956
No.
Sit down, please.

16:53.623 --> 16:56.026
Look, it was wrong of you
to be mean to Tom, okay?

16:56.094 --> 16:57.794
Even though Daddy and I

16:57.862 --> 16:59.696
aren't always as open-minded
as we should be,

16:59.764 --> 17:01.865
we -- we want you
to be better than us.

17:01.933 --> 17:03.433
O-kay.

17:03.501 --> 17:07.304
No. Listen. We accept
people for who they are.

17:07.382 --> 17:09.883
Daddy and I would accept you
no matter what --

17:09.951 --> 17:11.318
boy, girl, gay, straight...

17:11.386 --> 17:14.154
though, if you're a lesbian,
please be the fun kind.

17:14.622 --> 17:16.890
I didn't yell at Tom
because he used to be Tina.

17:16.957 --> 17:19.925
- What? - I yelled at him
'cause he made fun of...

17:20.294 --> 17:21.929
Made fun of what?

17:22.597 --> 17:25.098
- What's -- What's to make fun of?
- Oh, thank God.

17:25.165 --> 17:27.634
He called you guys weirdos
for putting that painting up,

17:27.702 --> 17:28.702
so I called him a weirdo.

17:28.770 --> 17:30.170
Well, honey,
why didn't you tell us?

17:30.238 --> 17:33.040
'Cause I didn't want
your feelings to get hurt.

17:33.107 --> 17:34.274
Get hurt? How?

17:34.342 --> 17:36.376
Because that rube Tom
knows nothing about art?

17:36.444 --> 17:37.377
Cam, she was protecting us.

17:37.445 --> 17:40.013
But you don't have to,
sweetie, okay?

17:40.081 --> 17:41.548
Don't feel like
you can't be honest with us

17:41.616 --> 17:42.349
just to protect our feelings.

17:42.417 --> 17:44.551
- Really?
- Really.

17:44.619 --> 17:46.553
Hey, you can tell us anything.

17:46.621 --> 17:48.021
Okay.

17:48.089 --> 17:51.058
I hate the painting, too.

17:52.927 --> 17:57.331
It was hard for us to hear,
but in the spirit of tolerance,

17:57.398 --> 17:59.266
we accepted the fact
that a 9-year-old

17:59.334 --> 18:00.567
might not want to fall asleep

18:00.635 --> 18:03.603
under the watchful eyes
of her half-naked fathers.

18:03.671 --> 18:06.973
Call the Sistine Chapel.
I guess art is out.

18:07.041 --> 18:09.309
So, do you hate the whole idea
of murals, or just --

18:09.377 --> 18:12.012
Roll!

18:14.716 --> 18:15.782
It's going to be so exciting

18:15.850 --> 18:17.984
to get back to
all that science stuff again.

18:18.052 --> 18:20.520
You know -- beakers,
calculators, ray guns.

18:20.588 --> 18:21.822
Alex, are you sure
you don't want

18:21.889 --> 18:24.024
to spend a few more days here
to recover?

18:24.092 --> 18:26.059
You can sleep on the end
of our bed if you want to.

18:26.127 --> 18:28.895
- Yeah, stay, Alex.
- Sleeping does sound good.

18:28.963 --> 18:30.263
Doesn't it?

18:30.331 --> 18:32.999
But, first, how about
you take a nice, hot shower?

18:33.067 --> 18:36.002
I just hope that big pile
of wet towels isn't on the floor

18:36.069 --> 18:37.069
like it was this morning.

18:37.137 --> 18:39.005
Aww, you guys are so sweet.

18:39.073 --> 18:40.340
No, but what -- what about
all the science stuff?

18:40.408 --> 18:43.377
All the fun. You know --
snapping each other in the butts

18:43.444 --> 18:44.244
with your goggle straps.

18:44.312 --> 18:46.413
You know what?
Staying here a few more days

18:46.481 --> 18:48.615
may help me kick this sickness
a little faster.

18:48.683 --> 18:49.783
- There you go.
- Wait a second.

18:49.851 --> 18:52.352
I thought
I already packed my laptop.

18:52.420 --> 18:53.954
Why is it on the hallway table?

18:54.021 --> 18:55.722
Uh, why is anything anywhere?

18:55.789 --> 18:57.858
Why aren't our feet
at the end of our arms?

18:57.925 --> 19:00.694
Who opened my 12th-grade
<i>Grapes of Wrath</i> essay?

19:00.762 --> 19:01.928
Uh...

19:01.996 --> 19:03.897
Oh, my God.
You just want me to stay here

19:03.965 --> 19:05.599
so you can steal
all of my old homework.

19:05.666 --> 19:06.666
Wow. I can't wait
to hear what you have

19:06.734 --> 19:08.335
to say about
this lapse in judgment.

19:08.403 --> 19:10.169
Hey, it's better
than what Mom's doing.

19:10.237 --> 19:12.072
She's just using you
to yell at us.

19:12.140 --> 19:13.540
I would nip that back talk
in the bud.

19:13.608 --> 19:15.409
I can't believe it.
He's right!

19:15.476 --> 19:16.943
Honey,
you're getting upset again.

19:17.011 --> 19:18.345
Come on.
Let's go get a treat.

19:18.413 --> 19:20.847
Stop with the petting
and -- and the walks.

19:20.915 --> 19:22.516
You're using me
as a therapy dog.

19:22.583 --> 19:23.383
That's ridiculi--

19:23.451 --> 19:25.419
<i>Am</i> I?

19:25.486 --> 19:27.454
Well... what about
what Luke's doing?

19:27.522 --> 19:28.822
We just dealt with him.

19:28.890 --> 19:30.123
And, Haley...

19:30.191 --> 19:34.227
you are the only one
who really cares about me.

19:34.295 --> 19:36.963
That's it!
I'm going back to school.

19:37.031 --> 19:37.864
I will drive you, sweetie.

19:37.932 --> 19:40.300
Alex, no.
Stop! Stay!

19:40.368 --> 19:42.102
How do you ask a human
not to go, again?

19:42.170 --> 19:43.236
- Alex, wait!
- Right.

19:44.705 --> 19:46.740
We're still leaving.
She's just catching her breath.

19:46.808 --> 19:49.175
- Come on. - I feel so bad.
I had no idea what I was doing.

19:49.242 --> 19:51.678
I feel worse. I really,
really knew what I was doing.

19:51.746 --> 19:54.080
Our poor sick daughter.
We should be taking care of her.

19:54.147 --> 19:55.649
So, is knowing all this
enough,

19:55.716 --> 19:57.651
or do we have to, like,
do something?

19:58.753 --> 19:59.986
Breaks my heart.

20:00.054 --> 20:02.722
I should quit my job
and nurse her back to health.

20:02.790 --> 20:04.724
You got fired, didn't you?

20:05.560 --> 20:07.094
Alex had to take
the semester off.

20:07.162 --> 20:09.163
I was disappointed
'cause she was disappointed,

20:09.231 --> 20:12.700
but I was also kind of happy to
have her home a little longer.

20:12.768 --> 20:14.635
- Aww.
- Mask!

20:17.806 --> 20:18.373
Cam?

20:18.468 --> 20:19.935
Oh, I just wanted
to tell her how proud I was

20:20.003 --> 20:22.504
of how she handled herself today,
but she's already asleep.

20:22.572 --> 20:23.739
Well, you can tell her
in the morning, okay?

20:23.807 --> 20:26.042
Oh, by the way,
I found an article online

20:26.109 --> 20:28.010
about a family
of Montenegrin art restorers --

20:28.078 --> 20:29.679
Let it go, babe.
Come on. Come on.

20:29.746 --> 20:31.947
Oh, Cam.

20:32.716 --> 20:35.217
Look what she did.

20:39.730 --> 20:41.730
Jay, what are you doing?
Come to bed.

20:41.956 --> 20:43.857
I've got these new
state-of-the-art cameras.

20:43.923 --> 20:45.357
I thought I'd review the day,

20:45.425 --> 20:47.459
see how many times
our neighbor glared at us.

20:47.527 --> 20:49.194
Wait a second.

20:49.262 --> 20:52.664
Is that Manny licking cupcake
wrappers from the trash?

20:52.732 --> 20:54.233
I knew he'd fold.

20:54.300 --> 20:56.534
Ah, the vigor.
It's almost pornographic.

20:56.742 --> 20:58.577
Are these cameras everywhere?

20:58.661 --> 20:59.962
Yeah.
That's the garbage area.

21:00.029 --> 21:02.730
Then we got the backyard,
front door.

21:02.798 --> 21:04.933
Go inside. Wait.

21:05.001 --> 21:07.602
That's <i>Joe</i> peeing
in the corner, not <i>Stella.</i>

21:07.634 --> 21:09.601
That's it.
He lives outside now.

21:09.669 --> 21:11.704
Come. We'll watch him
from the cameras.

21:11.972 --> 21:13.272
Hold on.

21:14.367 --> 21:16.034
You have a problem.

21:16.102 --> 21:17.970
I'm gonna get you
one of those rubber remotes

21:18.037 --> 21:20.539
they put in nursery schools
and insane asylums.

21:20.607 --> 21:21.707
Thank you.
