food was the first, you know,

foundation and that's important

me, though, it kind of goes back

13:20.174 --> 13:24.470

cooking and preserving and

13:24.471 --> 13:26.472

That's beautiful.

25:18.184 --> 25:20.726
Sweet.

25:20.727 --> 25:24.105
When you had your first plate full of proper rice,

25:24.106 --> 25:26.941
is there an instinct to
bludgeon the rest of the world

25:26.942 --> 25:30.487
in an understanding of what
you'd just come to understand?

25:30.488 --> 25:34.282
I did not run up and down
the streets of Charleston.

25:34.283 --> 25:37.076
It was tough to dislodge people here,

25:37.077 --> 25:39.662
so I just went straight to San Francisco.

25:39.663 --> 25:40.830
Right.

25:40.831 --> 25:42.874
I gave away tons of product.

25:42.875 --> 25:45.669
And guess what, they went crazy.

25:47.380 --> 25:51.300
<i>Slow baked black bass, ramps
in season, and lettuces.</i>

25:54.845 --> 25:58.639
<i>And this to all things Glen is
responsible for bringing back.</i>

25:58.640 --> 26:02.060
<i>Heirloom rice and pigs, suckling asabal pig</i>

26:02.061 --> 26:05.688
<i>and Carolina gold rice.</i>

26:05.689 --> 26:08.400
Isn't that great?

26:08.401 --> 26:11.027
This is phenomenal. These peas are killer.

26:11.028 --> 26:12.778
I'm hitting the rice next.

26:12.779 --> 26:16.699
That's got the entire history
of Southern agriculture in it.

26:16.700 --> 26:18.243
Right here.

26:18.244 --> 26:19.827
Right there in that little bowl.

26:19.828 --> 26:24.123
This whole idea of having a century in a dish,

26:24.124 --> 26:28.127
none of this stuff was here 20 years ago.

26:28.128 --> 26:30.213
<i>Near the end of the Civil War,</i>

26:30.214 --> 26:32.757
<i>during General Sherman's scorched earth campaign,</i>

26:32.758 --> 26:35.510
<i>seed stores were a favored target.</i>

26:35.511 --> 26:38.930
<i>It was largely African slaves
who were able to save the seeds</i>

26:38.931 --> 26:43.935
<i>that Glen is now able to locate and reintroduce.</i>

26:43.936 --> 26:47.146
It is those people who kept the corn.

26:47.147 --> 26:49.606
It is those people who kept the cow peas.

26:49.607 --> 26:52.651
It's those people who kept the
vegetables because they couldn't

26:52.652 --> 26:54.653
buy their way out of not doing it.

26:54.654 --> 26:58.657
Will you talk about chitlins, pig foot, hog maws,

26:58.658 --> 27:00.285
African Americans in the north do not

27:00.286 --> 27:04.830
embrace those classics of the

27:04.831 --> 27:08.918
South as an overlay of pain and
oppression that goes with it.

27:08.919 --> 27:10.711
How do we combat that?

27:10.712 --> 27:13.714
What you're speaking about is
walking away from your own

27:13.715 --> 27:16.384
culinary heritage because of social sensitivity.

27:16.385 --> 27:19.678
Bottom line is, if you want
something that's compelling,

27:19.679 --> 27:24.518
that draws on your soul, this
is why they call it soul food.

27:28.606 --> 27:32.275
I need the finest in turkey-killing couture.

27:32.276 --> 27:34.693
I want to be ninja-like and I want to look cool.

27:34.694 --> 27:40.158
Camouflage is the standard go out
wearing South Carolina, so...

27:40.159 --> 27:44.787
I'm bringing that look to New York.

27:44.788 --> 27:46.205
<i>The cool, clear morning</i>

27:46.206 --> 27:48.707

27:50.710 --> 27:52.253
<i>look for turkeys to kill.</i>

27:52.254 --> 27:53.338
Pants, need those.

27:53.339 --> 27:54.632
All right.

27:56.634 --> 27:59.927
You know, in South Carolina, our
state bird is the mosquito.

27:59.928 --> 28:02.096
Right. So I want to be covered head to toe.

28:02.097 --> 28:05.184
We need your face covered up.

28:07.478 --> 28:10.813
Going to the waffle house wearing this.

28:10.814 --> 28:12.732
This is totally me.

28:14.901 --> 28:16.693
We do have some turkey vests.

28:16.694 --> 28:18.363
Turkey vest, yes.

28:18.364 --> 28:20.491
I just... gotta have it.

28:25.037 --> 28:28.414
This is your last day on earth, Mr. turkey.

28:28.415 --> 28:30.625
You will die now.

28:30.626 --> 28:32.878
Prepare to meet your maker.

28:41.637 --> 28:43.262
<i>Here's the thing about hunting.</i>

<i>And like magic, behold.</i>

29:19.132 --> 29:20.800
<i>Turkey.</i>

29:21.885 --> 29:24.220
<i>Slow, slow barbecued turkey,</i>

29:24.221 --> 29:28.641
<i>with all the sides you want and need.</i>

29:28.642 --> 29:30.560
What do we got going on here?

29:30.561 --> 29:32.228
Pigs feet and collard greens.

29:32.229 --> 29:33.688
Pickled pigs feet and collard greens.

29:33.689 --> 29:35.189
Oh, yes.

29:35.190 --> 29:37.525
Barbecue coleslaw.

29:37.526 --> 29:39.694
Potato salad and ramps.

29:39.695 --> 29:41.987
Baked red peas.

29:41.988 --> 29:44.073
There's my weakness right there.

29:44.074 --> 29:45.950
We made you some very special...

29:45.951 --> 29:47.159
Mac and cheese.

29:47.160 --> 29:49.036
Bright orange mac and cheese.

29:49.037 --> 29:51.122
I do like bright orange mac and cheese as you know.

29:51.123 --> 29:52.290
That's a turkey.

29:52.291 --> 29:53.625
Yep.

29:53.626 --> 29:55.543
Let that to be lesson to you.

29:55.544 --> 29:57.836
Like going to Grandma's house.

29:57.837 --> 29:59.756
<i>Mike Latta from Fig is here</i>

29:59.757 --> 30:02.759

30:06.597 --> 30:09.181
basically keeping it real as far

30:09.182 --> 30:11.100
as real Southern culinary traditions

30:11.101 --> 30:13.645
as opposed to the jokey ones?

30:13.646 --> 30:15.813
More than you think.

30:15.814 --> 30:18.023
How many people is that?

30:18.024 --> 30:20.526
12.

30:20.527 --> 30:22.903
Yeah, in a town like this, that's pretty amazing.

30:22.904 --> 30:24.656
Goddamn, this is good.

30:24.657 --> 30:27.158
Pigs feet and green, this is ridiculously good.

30:27.159 --> 30:29.702
This is really moist for a wild turkey.

30:29.703 --> 30:31.788
People who say they don't
like turkey need to eat this.

30:31.789 --> 30:33.914
What's your impression of Charleston?

30:33.915 --> 30:38.169
It's one of those weird
distinctly American mutations

30:38.170 --> 30:41.255
kind of like rock 'n' roll or jazz or blues.

30:41.256 --> 30:43.424
That's what makes Charleston so
cool, though, there's really

30:43.425 --> 30:45.384
nothing else like it in America

30:45.385 --> 30:47.219
and it's been unique since the

30:47.220 --> 30:48.680
early part of the 18th century

30:48.681 --> 30:51.182
and the city works hard to preserve that.

30:51.183 --> 30:54.101
We have an incredibly gorgeous
city that people want

30:54.102 --> 30:56.604
to visit. So we have the advantage of tourism.

30:56.605 --> 31:00.191
The clientele definitely gives
us the opportunity to be

31:00.192 --> 31:02.485
this progressive or...

31:02.486 --> 31:03.611
Almost push us to be more

31:03.612 --> 31:05.070
than we can even be.

31:05.071 --> 31:07.072
We have an active cuisine.

31:07.073 --> 31:08.866
We've recovered all these

31:08.867 --> 31:12.036
ingredients and rediscovered
a lot of the agricultural

31:12.037 --> 31:16.666
influences that were destroyed
in the 20th century, but we're

31:16.667 --> 31:19.251
not just recreating history.

31:19.252 --> 31:21.629
We're not going back and cooking the Civil War.

31:21.630 --> 31:24.423
These guys are pushing the food
forward here and we're creating

31:24.424 --> 31:26.217
a new cuisine.

31:26.218 --> 31:28.970
Got to be a happy day when you
take a Cesar off the menu.

31:45.529 --> 31:50.616
We're one of the last few hunters in the world.

31:50.617 --> 31:52.993
There's no store for us to go offshore

31:52.994 --> 31:55.079
to go and pick those fish up.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.455
We have to look for them. We have to go and sort of

31:56.456 --> 31:58.957
find the ones we're allowed to harvest.

31:58.958 --> 32:02.545
We're the last of the final
frontier of hunters, you know,

32:02.546 --> 32:05.965

falls into crumbles.

36:32.899 --> 36:35.485
You got to have that. Look at that.

36:38.071 --> 36:41.323
This is what we call pork spaghetti.

36:41.324 --> 36:43.660
Got to have some of that.

36:46.496 --> 36:48.246
Man, that sauce is nice, too.

36:48.247 --> 36:49.790
Perfect. Right?

36:49.791 --> 36:51.167
Red pepper.

36:51.168 --> 36:52.960
That's my dad's recipe.

36:52.961 --> 36:56.672
You do not the standard South
Carolina mustard dressing

36:56.673 --> 36:58.298
at all?

36:58.299 --> 36:59.591
Pissed at me about this because

36:59.592 --> 37:01.593
people feel strongly about these things.

37:01.594 --> 37:04.262
I was not liking that mustard thing.

37:04.263 --> 37:06.348
Around here you scream mustard, they'll think it's

37:06.349 --> 37:07.850
going on a hot dog.

37:07.851 --> 37:09.226
That's the only thing they know about mustard here.

37:09.227 --> 37:10.477
Oh, good.

37:10.478 --> 37:12.771
Oh, man, that's just so good.

37:12.772 --> 37:15.983
How many hours, about, that pig is cooking?

37:15.984 --> 37:17.693
12 hours. About 12.

37:17.694 --> 37:18.986
You have to love it.

37:18.987 --> 37:20.445
You have to be head over heels

37:20.446 --> 37:22.280
in love with it to do that every day.

37:22.281 --> 37:23.824
I mean, do you ever get sick of eating barbecue?

37:23.825 --> 37:25.326
No, not yet.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.667
What are we fishing for here?

37:33.668 --> 37:38.797
Well, out here we got spot tail
bass, flounder, sea trout.

37:38.798 --> 37:41.383
Really? -Yeah.

37:41.384 --> 37:43.970
I got you.

37:46.264 --> 37:49.767
The way you fish here, throw
it out as far as you can and

37:49.768 --> 37:51.476
just leave it.

37:51.477 --> 37:53.311
Just leave it?

37:53.312 --> 37:55.231
That's the cool thing about fishing out here.

37:55.232 --> 37:59.317
I don't have to be working,
not much skill involved.

37:59.318 --> 38:04.281
So how am I doing in learning
to be a red neck department?

38:04.282 --> 38:05.449
Not wearing shoes.

38:05.450 --> 38:07.159
You're looking good.

38:07.160 --> 38:10.454
Without shoes on, a fishing
pole in your hand on a dock.

38:10.455 --> 38:12.540
That's pretty awesome.

38:21.507 --> 38:23.259
That's a different pace here, man.

38:23.260 --> 38:25.636
You know, this is the way to live.

38:25.637 --> 38:27.512
I enjoy it.

38:27.513 --> 38:28.680
Love that waffle house, man.

38:28.681 --> 38:31.475
I tell you, that was like a...

38:31.476 --> 38:33.644
I like your restaurant and all.

38:33.645 --> 38:37.564
I guess you're some kind of good
chef, but that waffle house.

38:37.565 --> 38:38.732

How's the visit, too, to Charleston?

39:17.314 --> 39:19.064
It's been great.

39:19.065 --> 39:20.440
This is a special place.

39:20.441 --> 39:21.692
Really is.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.485
Very unique.

39:23.486 --> 39:28.573
It's been a lot of fun to watch
the food scene here go from

39:28.574 --> 39:30.826
kind of what everybody else is doing,

39:30.827 --> 39:34.579
was doing, to doing something very singular.

39:34.580 --> 39:37.124
Very special.

39:37.125 --> 39:40.044
And when you got a tradition
and when you have traditional

39:40.045 --> 39:44.631
recipes and a story behind food
like you have here, that's a

39:44.632 --> 39:46.383
really cool thing.

39:46.384 --> 39:50.137
Well, the thing is, I'm still
discovering stuff here.

39:50.138 --> 39:51.847
I've been here 12 years.

39:51.848 --> 39:54.516
The barbecue that Rodney gave us was sick, man.

39:54.517 --> 39:58.896
He is... he is a force to be reckoned with, man.

39:58.897 --> 40:04.693
You talk about Europe, everybody
travels hours to go, or travels

40:04.694 --> 40:07.612
hours by car.

40:07.613 --> 40:10.074
It's the same thing here.
We just do it for barbecue.

40:10.075 --> 40:11.367
Got a hit?

40:11.368 --> 40:13.327
I don't know. We'll see.

40:13.328 --> 40:14.494
Yeah.

40:14.495 --> 40:15.662
You did.

40:15.663 --> 40:17.122
It bit right below the hook.

40:17.123 --> 40:18.665
Yeah.

40:18.666 --> 40:20.167
So that's an intelligent
mother [ muted ] fish, too.

40:20.168 --> 40:21.920
Big and intelligent.

40:25.298 --> 40:27.591
Hook up under the bottom lip.

40:27.592 --> 40:29.468
Ouch.

40:33.431 --> 40:36.516
Open.

40:36.517 --> 40:38.102
Oh, he got my leg.

40:38.103 --> 40:42.147
He's an eel seeking...
