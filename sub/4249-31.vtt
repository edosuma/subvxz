WELL, LOOK.

08:27.798 --> 08:29.508
THIS IS THE SYMBOL FOR MIRROR,

08:29.592 --> 08:32.260
AND SINCE ONE OF THE REFLECTORS
IS A MIRROR,

08:32.345 --> 08:33.511
I JUST ASSUMED THAT ALL
THE REFLECTORS WOULD BE MIRRORS

08:33.596 --> 08:36.682
OR MADE OF GLASS
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

08:36.765 --> 08:37.767

09:14.679 --> 09:18.432
OR THE NEXT PERSON THAT ASKS YOU

09:18.516 --> 09:22.687
WILL BE WEARING A UNIFORM,
HOLDING A POLICE BADGE.

09:22.770 --> 09:23.562
- IT'S THE COLLECTOR.

09:23.646 --> 09:26.357
- THE ONE WHO'S GOT THE GEM.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.818
BUT...
[laughs] WHY?

09:28.901 --> 09:30.236
WHY TRUDY?

09:30.319 --> 09:31.779
- I-I DON'T KNOW.

09:31.862 --> 09:34.156
BUT I DO KNOW THAT THE COLLECTOR
IS VERY DANGEROUS.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.826
IF YOU GO TO THE POLICE,
THEN TRUDY...

09:36.909 --> 09:37.618
- WHAT CAN I DO?

09:37.702 --> 09:40.162
- WE DO AS WE'RE TOLD.

09:40.246 --> 09:41.706
THE COLLECTOR HAS AN APPETITE

09:41.789 --> 09:44.166
FOR ANYTHING THAT BELONGED
TO THE FROBISHER-SMYTHES.

09:44.250 --> 09:47.003
SO I NEED YOU TO--
- TO STEAL FOR YOU.

09:47.086 --> 09:48.629

09:48.713 --> 09:51.173
- [laughs]
- WELCOME TO MY WORLD, JEROME.

09:51.257 --> 09:53.592
THERE'S NO WAY BACK.

09:58.764 --> 10:01.976
- 12 SYMBOLS,
TWO PER REFLECTOR,

10:02.059 --> 10:03.686
FACING EACH OTHER.

10:03.769 --> 10:06.605
ONE IS USELESS WITHOUT
THE OTHER.

10:06.689 --> 10:08.774
- NINA, COME ON.

10:08.858 --> 10:10.568
LET'S GET BACK OUT, YEAH?

10:14.447 --> 10:17.074

10:17.158 --> 10:18.200

10:18.284 --> 10:20.202
- NO, YOUR LOCKET.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.538

10:22.621 --> 10:23.080
OH.

BUT WHAT FOR?

10:28.210 --> 10:29.462
- LOOK, IT'S GETTING DIMMER.

10:29.545 --> 10:32.256
- NOW IT'S GETTING BRIGHTER.

10:32.340 --> 10:36.218

THERE'S A SPECIAL LOCK.

10:44.852 --> 10:46.896
MY LOCKET DOESN'T OPEN THIS.

10:46.979 --> 10:51.108
AN AMULET DOES.

10:51.192 --> 10:52.234
- MAYBE IT'S MINE.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.028
MAYBE I'M THE CHOSEN TWO.

10:57.865 --> 11:00.159
WHY DON'T YOU FIND A DOOR
THAT RECOGNIZES MY TALENT?

11:00.242 --> 11:03.579
- WAIT.

11:03.662 --> 11:03.996
IT'S THE IBIS.
WHO HAS THE IBIS?

11:04.080 --> 11:07.041
- NO.

11:07.124 --> 11:10.294
- NONE OF US DO.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.922
THE AMULET THAT OPENS THIS DOOR
IS VICTOR'S.

11:18.511 --> 11:19.929
- [sighs]
ANOTHER DOOR.

11:20.012 --> 11:21.514
WE NEED THAT AMULET NOW
MORE THAN EVER.

11:21.597 --> 11:23.015
- OKAY,
LET'S GO OVER THE PLAN.

11:23.099 --> 11:27.144
OKAY, I TAKE THE FAKE AMULET
AND PLACE IT UP MY SLEEVE.

11:27.228 --> 11:28.771
