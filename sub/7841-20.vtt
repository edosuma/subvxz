00:30.263 --> 00:33.573
Welcome to the 38th annual
Springfield Showbiz Awards.

00:33.574 --> 00:36.577
There are more stars here tonight
than you can see in the sky,

00:36.578 --> 00:37.682
thanks to light pollution.

00:37.683 --> 00:39.745
Here comes
the magnificently-mammaried,

00:39.746 --> 00:42.765
mistress of midnight movie
mayhem, Booberella.

00:42.837 --> 00:44.854
The twins look happy tonight.

00:45.233 --> 00:46.446
And what have we here?

00:46.447 --> 00:50.142
It's ventriloquist Arthur Crandall
and his walnut wingman, Gabbo.

00:50.145 --> 00:52.000
- Gabbo!
- Gabbo, over here!

00:52.053 --> 00:53.999
Get a job, parasites.

00:56.567 --> 00:59.799
We now come to our final award,
"Entertainer of the Year."

00:59.798 --> 01:02.245
An award so prestigious,
that it recently won

01:02.249 --> 01:05.971
the "Award of the Year" award
at the 2007 Awardy Awards.

01:06.008 --> 01:08.301
This year's nominees are
an eclectic group.

01:08.348 --> 01:10.402
This distinguished-looking
gentleman

01:10.406 --> 01:12.540
is a highly-respected actor.

01:12.545 --> 01:14.542
It's not important what he says,

01:14.545 --> 01:16.421
or who he's a parody of.

01:16.425 --> 01:19.112
Only one person
here really matters....

01:19.116 --> 01:21.520
the recipient of this award.

01:21.525 --> 01:23.192
No, it is not me.

01:23.208 --> 01:26.190
I am but your humble narrator
in this tale of fame,

01:26.195 --> 01:27.780
betrayal and coin collecting.

01:27.787 --> 01:29.370
But more about that later.

01:29.385 --> 01:30.593
Nor is it him.

01:30.596 --> 01:31.810
Nor him.

01:31.815 --> 01:33.060
Nor ham.

01:33.077 --> 01:36.170
No, tonight is about her.

01:36.176 --> 01:38.323
This year's award goes to...

01:38.328 --> 01:39.891
Lisa Simpson.

01:43.087 --> 01:44.513
Surprised?

01:44.536 --> 01:46.300
Let me start at the beginning,

01:46.305 --> 01:49.642
and tell you a little bit
about Lisa.

01:49.645 --> 01:52.863
In fact, All About Lisa.

01:55.346 --> 01:58.672
And now, in honor
of Krusty's 4,000th episode,

01:58.677 --> 02:01.582
put your hands together
for Drew Carey.

02:01.795 --> 02:03.130
Thank you.

02:03.286 --> 02:04.320
Thank you.

02:04.338 --> 02:07.622
Wow, 4,000 episodes.

02:07.636 --> 02:10.759
It seems like just yesterday
Krusty stole his first joke from me.

02:11.478 --> 02:13.081
Seriously, though, I remember watching

02:13.087 --> 02:14.260
him as a kid, and I thought,

02:14.266 --> 02:16.081
"I could do that, and I'm a kid."

02:16.087 --> 02:20.081
What I love about Krusty is,
he's always on...

02:20.088 --> 02:22.862
but to find out what,
you've gotta test his pee.

02:22.866 --> 02:23.970
Pee!

02:24.955 --> 02:26.783
Seriously,
test his pee.

02:26.787 --> 02:28.550
He's a danger
to the community.

02:28.556 --> 02:32.120
And now I give you a man
whose act will never grow old,

02:32.138 --> 02:34.162
because it started out that way:

02:36.246 --> 02:37.931
Krusty the Clown.

02:39.686 --> 02:40.640
Thank you.

02:40.646 --> 02:43.781
I never thought I'd make
it past 400 episodes,

02:43.798 --> 02:45.570
what with the drinking and the smoking

02:45.577 --> 02:47.501
and the fact that I'm
just not that good.

02:47.508 --> 02:51.052
It seems like just yesterday
that we started the show,

02:51.055 --> 02:53.300
with the original Krusketeers.

02:55.066 --> 02:58.971
Who's our favorite TV clown
who likes to clown around?

02:58.977 --> 03:00.042
K-R-U...

03:00.048 --> 03:01.162
S-T-Y...

03:01.165 --> 03:04.752
Hey! Quit steppin' on my solo,
ya creepy little show monkeys!

03:09.125 --> 03:11.401
And here they are today.

03:11.405 --> 03:13.541
Come on out, Krusketeers.

03:13.628 --> 03:15.032
I'm Jesse.

03:19.827 --> 03:21.021
C.J.

03:26.237 --> 03:27.892
You owe me money, Krusty.

03:27.895 --> 03:29.621
I did time for you, clown.

03:29.627 --> 03:30.731
Hard time.

03:30.816 --> 03:34.502
Isn't that great.
They all came back to see me.

03:34.506 --> 03:37.280
That's right.
All except the successful ones.

03:37.287 --> 03:39.160
Now guess what, kids?

03:39.166 --> 03:42.842
The Krusty Show is searching
for a new Krusketeer.

03:42.848 --> 03:45.600
It could be any of you.

03:45.606 --> 03:47.063
As long you're willing to sign

03:47.067 --> 03:48.812
a 20 year personal services contract

03:48.818 --> 03:51.291
where I get 99%
of all your earnings.

03:51.938 --> 03:53.823
I am so gonna try out for that.

03:53.825 --> 03:56.062
Me, too.
But I hope you get it.

03:56.066 --> 03:57.722
No, I hope you get it.

03:57.726 --> 03:59.850
Well, I really
hope you get it.

03:59.857 --> 04:02.012
Yeah, I hope I get it, too.
Later.

04:02.016 --> 04:05.522
For a second there,
he hoped I got it.

04:16.216 --> 04:18.521
A great man once observed:

04:18.596 --> 04:22.060
"90% of success is
showing up on time."

04:22.076 --> 04:23.622
Sorry I'm four hours late.

04:23.627 --> 04:26.570
Now let's pick a Krusketeer!

04:41.358 --> 04:43.192
For my first impression...

04:44.545 --> 04:46.460
I'm a lantern fish.

04:52.396 --> 04:54.532
Now I'm a jack-o'-lantern.

04:55.325 --> 04:56.801
E.T.

04:57.315 --> 04:59.160
B.E.T.

04:59.475 --> 05:01.051
Yay, Bart!

05:01.057 --> 05:03.820
My son's a good-for-somethin'!

05:03.825 --> 05:05.252
Uh, yeah, okay.

05:05.255 --> 05:07.131
You kids were all terrific.

05:07.137 --> 05:10.321
I wish I could make each
of you a Krusketeer,

05:10.326 --> 05:12.593
but we only have enough
money for one.

05:12.598 --> 05:14.123
Plus, I don't really want to.

05:14.128 --> 05:17.313
So after much consideration
of all your talents,

05:17.318 --> 05:20.013
my new Krusketeer is...

05:20.018 --> 05:21.353
What's your kid's name again?

05:21.355 --> 05:23.033
Nelson Muntz.

05:23.037 --> 05:24.942
Wilbur Mudd.

05:24.947 --> 05:25.902
That's me.

05:25.906 --> 05:28.011
- Here's Mudd in your eye.
- Ow!

05:29.735 --> 05:32.503
I can't believe I lost.

05:34.555 --> 05:37.371
That's not fair
Bart was great.

05:38.015 --> 05:39.292
Hey, Krusty,...

05:39.338 --> 05:42.080
you're making a huge mistake
not hiring my brother.

05:42.086 --> 05:43.483
Why don't you hire them both?

05:43.485 --> 05:46.283
It won't cost you anything
you could call Bart an intern.

05:46.285 --> 05:48.642
In fact, the intern thing could open up

05:48.648 --> 05:51.070
a whole new world of free labor for you.

05:51.077 --> 05:52.940
Did you know the Discovery Channel

05:52.948 --> 05:54.922
doesn't have a single paid employee?

05:54.958 --> 05:57.652
Hm. Okay, kid,
you've convinced me.

05:57.656 --> 05:59.233
To make Bart a Krusketeer?

05:59.237 --> 06:01.901
Hell, no.
To make you my new intern.

06:01.905 --> 06:03.362
You're a real go-getter.

06:03.376 --> 06:04.920
Now go get me
my dry-cleaning,

06:04.937 --> 06:06.623
which is my code word
for scotch.

06:06.625 --> 06:08.020
And get me a scotch,

06:08.025 --> 06:09.913
which is my code word
for my bookie.

06:09.915 --> 06:11.773
Also, go get
my dry-cleaning.

06:11.777 --> 06:14.273
- Wha... but...
- Wha, but, wha, wha, wha, but.

06:14.277 --> 06:15.620
What are you standing
around for?

06:15.625 --> 06:18.273
I wish I was paying you,
so I could dock your salary.

06:20.198 --> 06:21.871
Lisa didn't know it then,

06:21.886 --> 06:25.552
but she had just dipped her
toe into the business of show.

06:25.556 --> 06:30.430
And it is a business, as you shall
find out in about three seconds.

06:30.436 --> 06:32.221
Two... one...

06:32.688 --> 06:34.971
Over the years, show business

06:34.975 --> 06:36.980
has been home to scoundrels and saints,

06:36.986 --> 06:40.281
thespians and harlequins,
Abbots and Costelli.

06:40.286 --> 06:42.702
And they all had one thing
in common...

06:42.715 --> 06:45.101
an underpaid assistant.

06:45.116 --> 06:48.713
Cancel my 1:00. Move my 2:00
to 1:00 and cancel that.

06:48.716 --> 06:51.940
Oh, and go to my joke file
and make all the"Sophia Lorens"

06:51.958 --> 06:53.311
into "Lindsay Lohans."

06:53.317 --> 06:54.733
So do a global change?

06:54.807 --> 06:56.500
What am I, Al Gore?
Just do it.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.590
What are you lookin' at?

07:04.593 --> 07:07.149
I'm just trying
to hit my marks.

07:07.147 --> 07:09.059
And I don't?
Is that what you're saying?

07:09.058 --> 07:11.775
No, no. I think you're
a consummate pro.

07:11.789 --> 07:13.671
Oh, so now you're judging me.

07:13.677 --> 07:14.883
Well, what do ya think of this:

07:14.885 --> 07:16.082
you're fired.

07:16.087 --> 07:19.392
Yeah, well, my mom says
you're a selfish lover.

07:19.398 --> 07:21.331
I know what I want
and I get it.

07:23.365 --> 07:25.612
I'll trash you in my memoirs!

07:25.625 --> 07:27.761
Pay attention you'll be writing
my memoirs.

07:27.768 --> 07:29.592
I'll never last here.

07:29.596 --> 07:31.150
Chin up, little gofer.

07:31.178 --> 07:33.433
You can succeed with Krusty.

07:33.436 --> 07:36.800
A few hints: Always carry a cigar
in case he asks.

07:36.816 --> 07:38.102
Never meet his gaze.

07:38.106 --> 07:41.761
And if he mentions
Mitzi Gaynor, and he will,

07:41.767 --> 07:45.263
for God's sake act like
you know who she is.

07:45.266 --> 07:47.222
I got pastrami stuck in my teeth,

07:47.225 --> 07:49.110
and that's everybody's problem.

07:49.117 --> 07:50.482
Who's got floss?

07:57.706 --> 07:58.871
Here you go, Krusty.

08:02.028 --> 08:04.203
Nicely done, kid.

08:04.217 --> 08:07.113
You're the best thing that's happened
to this business since...

08:07.116 --> 08:08.443
Mitzi Gaynor?

08:08.447 --> 08:11.682
I was gonna say
"cheap Korean animation," but sure.

08:12.387 --> 08:15.481
I can't believe you're working
for Krusty and I'm not.

08:15.496 --> 08:17.403
I know everything
about that clown.

08:17.408 --> 08:19.010
Favorite blintz: blueberry.

08:19.018 --> 08:21.873
Favorite horse in the 2004
Belmont: Smarty Jones.

08:21.876 --> 08:23.461
Krusty lost a bundle and had to

08:23.468 --> 08:24.950
endorse baby wipes in Norway.

08:24.955 --> 08:26.253
Which I have a case of.

08:26.255 --> 08:28.253
Krusty klovnen
baby visker!

08:30.196 --> 08:32.462
Stupid Krusty...I hate this...

08:32.466 --> 08:35.220
Bart's having girl trouble.
You better go talk to him.

08:35.227 --> 08:36.621
It's clown trouble.

08:36.628 --> 08:38.370
That's your responsibility.

08:38.376 --> 08:41.573
I thought I was in charge of
bedtime stories and pets dying.

08:41.578 --> 08:43.352
Yeah, well,
we're adding clowns.

08:43.357 --> 08:44.881
Oh! Fine.

08:44.888 --> 08:48.170
But you just bought yourself "ear piercing"
and "strange new feelings."

08:48.187 --> 08:49.193
Fine.

08:49.207 --> 08:52.091
Lisa's got school,
career, posture.

08:52.096 --> 08:54.012
Why did she have to
steal Krusty from me?

08:54.015 --> 08:56.780
Son, the healthy
thing is to get rid of

08:56.785 --> 08:59.310
everything that reminds
you of Krusty...

08:59.316 --> 09:01.530
which appears to be everything.

09:01.536 --> 09:04.232
Hey, maybe we should
give Lisa this room.

09:04.237 --> 09:06.250
You know she works
for Krusty now.

09:08.058 --> 09:09.570
Okay, here's my offer:

09:09.578 --> 09:11.692
All this prim
Krusty merchandise

09:11.695 --> 09:14.410
for that copy of "Radioactive
Man vs. Muhammad Ali."

09:14.415 --> 09:15.513
My counter offer:

09:15.517 --> 09:18.302
"Radioactive Man Meets
the Kansas City Royals."

09:18.307 --> 09:20.502
How about "Radioactive Man vs.

09:20.516 --> 09:22.193
Restless Leg Syndrome"?

09:22.417 --> 09:24.372
Let us try a different tack.

09:24.385 --> 09:26.413
Are you interested
in coin collecting?

09:26.416 --> 09:28.953
- Am I?! No.
- Hmm.

09:30.907 --> 09:32.362
Wait, wait, wait.

09:32.367 --> 09:34.783
I will start you off with
this bicentennial quarter

09:34.788 --> 09:36.990
and I will throw in
my man scrunchie.

09:42.727 --> 09:45.750
Uh, we'll stick with the coins.

09:47.478 --> 09:49.433
Whoa, nice.

09:49.435 --> 09:51.351
Everything in its place,

09:51.355 --> 09:53.793
nothin' festering
inside of nothin'.

09:53.795 --> 09:56.371
You've alphabetized
my book collection.

09:57.308 --> 09:59.511
I've never had such
a great assistant.

10:00.248 --> 10:02.713
I'm gonna call you
"The Goy Wonder."

10:02.716 --> 10:04.713
Because I don't
remember your name.

10:04.815 --> 10:07.861
All right, time to fill
these slots with coins.

10:08.197 --> 10:09.812
Specific coins?

10:10.336 --> 10:12.010
This hobby sucks.

10:12.016 --> 10:14.440
Son, all hobbies suck.

10:14.446 --> 10:17.320
But if you keep at it,
you might find at the end

10:17.325 --> 10:20.353
that you've managed to
kill some precious time.

10:20.356 --> 10:23.302
Wow, I never thought
of it like that.

10:23.308 --> 10:25.083
Do you want to collect coins
with your old man?

10:25.096 --> 10:26.572
You bet I do!

10:26.576 --> 10:27.993
To your mother's purse.

10:34.866 --> 10:36.573
Take A penny
Leave a penny

10:39.878 --> 10:41.443
Toll Booth

10:50.257 --> 10:51.913
Luck O' The Irish
Wishing well

10:53.607 --> 10:55.650
What's you're doin' here ?
That's just my well !

10:55.658 --> 10:58.001
You don't like swearing
prayers around my well!

10:58.006 --> 10:58.650
Oh, yeah?

10:58.655 --> 11:00.561
Well, what do you think
of them apples?

11:01.705 --> 11:03.453
I'll take all of ya.

11:04.967 --> 11:08.292
No, don't put that...
Oh, no, I'll never gets out !

11:08.296 --> 11:11.981
Slide in the 1863
Confederate half dime

11:11.985 --> 11:14.603
and every slot is full.

11:14.606 --> 11:18.983
This is the first book I've ever finished
reading or pushing things into.

11:18.988 --> 11:20.753
What the...?
We missed one!

11:22.338 --> 11:26.440
"The Inverted Double-struck
Penny" or "Kissing Lincolns'

11:26.446 --> 11:29.690
was mistakenly minted
in December of 1917,

11:29.698 --> 11:32.681
when a brief glimpse of a woman's
ankle caused three days

11:32.687 --> 11:34.773
of rioting at the Philadelphia Mint."

11:34.777 --> 11:36.291
The one on the left
looks into it,

11:36.298 --> 11:39.160
but the one on the right is
just experimenting.

11:39.167 --> 11:41.643
Son, we are getting
that coin.

11:43.337 --> 11:45.403
Here I am,
walking the plank.

11:45.406 --> 11:48.781
I wish this mean pirate wasn't
poking me with his sword!

11:48.795 --> 11:51.333
- Where's the chimp?
- Mr. Teeny's not here.

11:51.338 --> 11:53.752
- He's stuck in traffic.
- Oh, what do I do?

11:53.758 --> 11:55.861
I can't ad lib
to save my life.

11:58.496 --> 12:01.343
Oh, boy, oh, boy.
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of fun.

12:01.346 --> 12:04.481
- What are you doing, kid?
- My job: making you look good.

12:04.487 --> 12:08.721
Oh, yeah, right.
So, what be your name, matey?

12:08.727 --> 12:11.912
Long John Seltzer!

12:21.966 --> 12:24.561
The laughter swept
over her like a wave,

12:24.568 --> 12:27.962
enveloping her in its
intoxicating embrace.

12:27.997 --> 12:31.300
The next week, Krusty went
to his Lake Tahoe retreat

12:31.298 --> 12:33.553
** for some R and R.

12:33.557 --> 12:36.253
But he was about
to get an unexpected visit

12:36.255 --> 12:38.281
from a third and fourth R,

12:38.286 --> 12:40.580
Ron Rabinowitz.

12:40.775 --> 12:43.260
Krusty, I've been your
agent for 45 years.

12:43.265 --> 12:46.400
I am telling you, watch out
for this Lisa Simpson character.

12:46.408 --> 12:48.320
She has got a taste
for Lady Laughter,

12:48.325 --> 12:50.753
and she will step right over
a certain clown to get it.

12:50.758 --> 12:52.410
Which clown?
Chuckles?

12:52.418 --> 12:53.691
Professor Nitwit?

12:53.705 --> 12:54.791
No, you!

12:54.797 --> 12:57.843
No Yu,
the Chinese Clown?

12:59.486 --> 13:02.110
Oh, great one, Krusty.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.510
But seriously,
you're in real trouble here.

13:05.018 --> 13:06.173
Yeah?

13:06.177 --> 13:07.302
What do you mean?

13:07.608 --> 13:10.400
If there was a rehearsal
for the network,

13:10.405 --> 13:12.743
I would've been told by my...

13:13.316 --> 13:15.451
...assistant!

13:15.456 --> 13:16.840
Well, where is he?

13:16.845 --> 13:18.852
I don't know,
I guess he forgot.

13:18.858 --> 13:21.352
But people seemed
to like me last week.

13:21.366 --> 13:23.022
You stood in
for Mr. Teeny.

13:23.035 --> 13:24.691
How'd you like to stand in
for Krusty?

13:24.695 --> 13:28.320
Oh, well, it's one thing
to fill in for a monkey.

13:28.335 --> 13:30.000
But a comedy legend?

13:30.006 --> 13:31.422
I wouldn't dream of it.

13:31.505 --> 13:33.412
I respect that.
Cancel the run-through.

13:33.415 --> 13:34.932
Okay, I'll do the monologue.

13:36.507 --> 13:38.002
Evening, Mr. Krusty.

13:38.008 --> 13:40.843
- Great show last...
- Sorry, I can't act like you matter!

13:46.828 --> 13:49.142
Have no fear,
the star is here!

13:49.148 --> 13:50.620
Shh!
We're working!

13:50.655 --> 13:51.842
Huh?

13:51.896 --> 13:54.612
So the centipede says:
"I'm goin'! I'm goin'!

13:54.615 --> 13:56.920
I'm just putting on my shoes!"

13:58.605 --> 14:01.583
Now, that's well-performed comedy!

14:01.586 --> 14:03.420
Oh, my God.

14:03.428 --> 14:05.962
Everything you said
came true, Ron.

14:05.968 --> 14:06.920
Uh, Ron?

14:06.938 --> 14:10.613
So you'll come to the agency tomorrow and
I'll introduce you to the whole team, okay?

14:10.615 --> 14:11.991
You like egg white omelets?

14:11.997 --> 14:14.183
I'll be waiting.
You're a good girl.

14:15.106 --> 14:18.032
I've been replaced by
an eight-year-old.

14:18.036 --> 14:19.230
I can be eight!

14:19.937 --> 14:21.593
La, la, la, la.

14:21.597 --> 14:23.611
I'm eight years old.

14:29.896 --> 14:33.863
Krusty, you've learned that fame,
that fickle beauty,

14:33.865 --> 14:35.911
can leave you when
you need it most.

14:35.916 --> 14:38.782
And Lisa had a lesson
to learn as well.

14:38.786 --> 14:40.782
A lesson about...
You, there!

14:40.787 --> 14:42.893
- Cut that out!
- Sorry, sorry.

14:45.777 --> 14:48.993
Thank you, folks.
You've been a great audience.

14:50.887 --> 14:53.350
I'm gonna keep this forever!

14:53.357 --> 14:57.260
All of Springfield fell head
over heels for Lisa.

14:57.507 --> 14:58.471
Here she comes.

14:58.478 --> 15:01.642
Quick, switch from internal
monologue to external dialogue!

15:01.648 --> 15:04.492
Shall we visit the commissary
to toast your success?

15:04.496 --> 15:05.442
Yeah, sure, Mel.

15:05.455 --> 15:07.943
Let me just wave one more
good-bye to my fans.

15:25.008 --> 15:30.090
While applause rained down on Lisa,
poor Krusty found himself parched.

15:30.106 --> 15:34.271
It's 3:32 a.m.,
which means it's time for

15:34.276 --> 15:38.022
Last Gasp with Krusty the Clown!

15:38.457 --> 15:40.370
Brought to you by Nappien,

15:40.375 --> 15:43.142
Nok-em-Out and
Nok-em-Out Jr. for kids.

15:43.147 --> 15:47.191
Tonight's guest is local bully,
Jimbo Jones?

15:50.338 --> 15:53.093
This is the lowest
I've ever sunk

15:53.095 --> 15:55.811
and I once made out
with a blow-up doll

16:03.137 --> 16:06.583
Sorry you broke up
with me now Cindy?

16:06.587 --> 16:09.530
One of these has got to be that
smooching Lincoln penny.

16:09.537 --> 16:11.581
Nope. Nope.
Dime. Button.

16:11.588 --> 16:13.082
- Pepperoni slice.
- Wait!

16:13.098 --> 16:16.752
This is a classic
1978 Pizza Hut!

16:18.027 --> 16:21.063
Mmm... terrible.

16:21.065 --> 16:23.252
Nope. Nope. Nope.

16:23.257 --> 16:26.452
Son, coin collecting's
a lot like life.

16:26.457 --> 16:29.561
It stopped being fun
a long time ago.

16:29.566 --> 16:32.770
But unlike life, I have
a solution for this.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.171
Gavelby's
Auction house.

16:34.175 --> 16:36.071
Going once, going twice...

16:36.075 --> 16:37.872
sold to Mr. Burns!

16:37.878 --> 16:39.412
I've won every coin.

16:39.417 --> 16:41.871
But I feel strangely empty.

16:41.876 --> 16:43.953
Ooh, there's another coin.
That should do it.

16:43.958 --> 16:48.770
Our last item up for bid is a mint
condition 1917 "Kissing Lincoln" penny.

16:48.788 --> 16:51.191
Okay, boy, this is it.
Five dollars!

16:51.195 --> 16:54.972
- $500.
- Five dollars cash!

16:54.977 --> 16:58.253
Sir, the promise of cash
is not an enticement.

16:58.258 --> 17:00.182
The current bid is $500.

17:00.188 --> 17:03.811
Do I hear a counter bid?
Going once, going twice...Dad?

17:03.818 --> 17:05.863
- $501!
- $10 million.

17:05.866 --> 17:08.380
- Objection, your honor.
- Sir, I am not a judge.

17:08.387 --> 17:12.531
But, um, overruled.
Sold to Mr. Burns for $10 million!

17:16.425 --> 17:20.691
I paid a pretty penny for this
pretty penny, but it was worth it.

17:22.077 --> 17:25.580
Mr. Burns, my son and
I have been collecting coins.

17:25.606 --> 17:28.329
It's really brought
us closer together.

17:28.347 --> 17:32.092
That penny you bought tonight
would mean the world to him.

17:32.098 --> 17:36.263
Yes, but the problem is,
if you had it, I wouldn't.

17:36.267 --> 17:37.793
You see difficulty.

17:37.797 --> 17:39.721
Mmm. Yeah.

17:39.728 --> 17:43.122
I'll tell you what, at least help
me buy the boy a gumball.

17:43.127 --> 17:45.821
- Do you have change for a nickel?
- Oh, of course.

17:46.746 --> 17:48.471
Smithers, step on it!

17:49.276 --> 17:51.540
I only gave him four cents
for that nickel.

17:51.545 --> 17:54.421
Monty Burns wins a...

17:54.616 --> 17:57.340
And... done.

17:57.358 --> 18:00.811
Now, let's put it on a shelf
and never look at it again.

18:00.817 --> 18:03.122
You got it, boy.

18:04.445 --> 18:07.273
And so, bonded by love
and larceny,

18:07.278 --> 18:09.760
father and son got dressed,

18:09.827 --> 18:11.623
had a minor disagreement...

18:11.627 --> 18:12.591
You little...

18:13.927 --> 18:15.352
...patched things up...

18:17.268 --> 18:18.681
Sorry, Dad.

18:18.688 --> 18:20.192
...and went downtown,

18:20.195 --> 18:22.120
where they watched proudly,

18:22.125 --> 18:25.000
as Lisa accepted her award.

18:31.075 --> 18:34.233
Lisa, before you walk away
from this venerable hall and

18:34.236 --> 18:38.041
into the arms of your adoring fans,
may I have a moment?

18:38.046 --> 18:41.102
Well, I do owe you everything.
Make it quick.

18:41.107 --> 18:45.463
Behold your fellow winners
of the Entertainer of the Year Award.

18:45.467 --> 18:47.641
Hmm.
I don't recognize any of them.

18:47.645 --> 18:49.453
And why should you?

18:49.458 --> 18:52.063
He appears nightly
on Broadway,

18:52.068 --> 18:54.701
selling combs and mints
in the men's room.

18:54.706 --> 18:57.543
She was fired after
a bad rehearsal

18:57.548 --> 18:59.910
from Homeboys In Outer Space.

18:59.918 --> 19:02.203
And perhaps
the saddest one of all,

19:02.207 --> 19:05.692
he graced stages from
London to Los Angeles.

19:05.698 --> 19:08.210
When he played
Biff in Death Of A Salesman,

19:08.218 --> 19:11.933
every woman in the audience
wished they were Hap.

19:11.948 --> 19:16.480
But that was before he...
"took the bone."

19:17.338 --> 19:20.551
Melvin Van Horne.

19:20.958 --> 19:22.973
Sideshow Mel?!

19:22.975 --> 19:24.093
It's you!

19:24.185 --> 19:28.021
How could this happen to you,
to all these wonderful performers?

19:28.026 --> 19:30.501
Applause is an addiction,

19:30.506 --> 19:33.760
like heroin or checking your e-mail.

19:33.776 --> 19:37.352
Once you have a taste,
you'll do anything to get more.

19:37.356 --> 19:39.601
Don't end up like these people.

19:39.608 --> 19:41.702
Don't end up like...

19:42.296 --> 19:43.410
me.

19:45.535 --> 19:47.873
I need to get out
while I still can.

19:47.875 --> 19:49.253
Thank you, Mel.

19:49.945 --> 19:51.370
Everyone, wait!

19:51.378 --> 19:53.790
Um, there's someone
I forgot to thank,

19:53.795 --> 19:55.131
and he's here tonight.

19:55.146 --> 19:57.533
Krusty, will you come up
on stage, please?

19:57.537 --> 19:58.751
What do you want?

19:58.755 --> 20:01.303
You've already taken
everything I care about.

20:01.306 --> 20:02.140
Really?

20:02.147 --> 20:04.040
So what else is in the news?

20:04.047 --> 20:06.701
This just in:
I don't give a crap.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.682
I'm trying to set you up
for laughs.

20:08.688 --> 20:10.873
Trying to set me up
with a giraffe?

20:12.306 --> 20:13.480
Oh, right.

20:13.488 --> 20:16.433
You guys know about giraffes...
long legs, big neck.

20:16.436 --> 20:17.781
Here comes the zinger.

20:17.788 --> 20:18.953
Speaking of necks,

20:18.957 --> 20:21.813
my girlfriend is
a real pain in mine.

20:21.816 --> 20:23.940
She crashed her car in
to mine and said,

20:23.946 --> 20:26.442
"Look, honey, we have a hybrid."

20:28.227 --> 20:29.491
Timely.

20:31.085 --> 20:33.352
By giving everything away,

20:33.357 --> 20:36.483
she was able to keep the only
thing that mattered:

20:36.485 --> 20:38.152
her dignity.

20:39.348 --> 20:42.060
God, how I envy her.

20:43.288 --> 20:45.930
Ooh, I think I'm in love!

20:45.938 --> 20:47.431
Krusty, please.

20:47.436 --> 20:49.902
My wife is giving birth
as we speak!

20:49.905 --> 20:52.123
Just four more takes.
Come on.

20:53.535 --> 20:54.331
No!

20:54.666 --> 20:56.480
Oh, Krusty, have a heart.
