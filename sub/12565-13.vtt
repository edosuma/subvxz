I would like all of you

00:05.365 --> 00:08.167
to serve on the hospital's
board of directors.

00:08.284 --> 00:10.702
I'm afraid my answer's no. I'm sorry.

00:10.787 --> 00:13.539
You hired the lawyer, the
one that helped Viviana.

00:13.673 --> 00:16.291
I had to do something to
make up for interfering.

00:18.411 --> 00:21.880
I sold those pictures to Snarkhampton.

00:21.965 --> 00:23.549
You sold a misleading picture of Hank,

00:23.683 --> 00:25.684

damage his reputation.

00:25.802 --> 00:26.852

00:26.936 --> 00:28.687
Yeah. Yeah, I would love that.

00:28.805 --> 00:29.721
That sounds great.

00:31.274 --> 00:33.225

00:33.359 --> 00:34.560
She didn't come back.

00:34.727 --> 00:37.896
All her stuff is gone, and so is she.

No new posts on her Twitter,
Instagram, or Tumblr feeds.

- She's not at Cinco's.

00:50.743 --> 00:52.294
Okay. Thank you.

00:52.412 --> 00:54.997
Fortunately, she's not
at the hospital either.

00:55.131 --> 00:57.249
Officer Don says he'll keep an eye out.

00:57.333 --> 00:59.251
What? That's the best the cops could do?

00:59.335 --> 01:00.752
Well, he also gave me some advice.

01:00.920 --> 01:02.254
- Which was?
- Try her social media,

01:02.388 --> 01:05.307
any guys she's been
seeing, and the hospital.

01:05.425 --> 01:08.844
I just... I can't believe I let this happen.

01:08.928 --> 01:10.562
Hank, this is not your fault.

01:10.647 --> 01:12.397
Well, my fault or not, she's gone.

01:12.482 --> 01:13.932
She's out there, all on her own.

some helpless little girl

who knows a thing or two

Emma's tough,

01:22.358 --> 01:25.944
and she will be fine until
she wants to be found.

01:26.112 --> 01:28.997
Thank you, but I still need
to make it right with her.

01:29.115 --> 01:30.499
Hank, when you checked Emma's room,

01:30.617 --> 01:31.700
you missed a spot.

01:31.834 --> 01:33.619
- She left this.
- Oh.

01:33.753 --> 01:35.370
Actually, it's addressed to Evan.

01:35.505 --> 01:37.956
Oh.

01:38.124 --> 01:39.424
What is it, a note?

01:39.542 --> 01:40.792
It's money.

01:40.927 --> 01:42.094
Money?

01:46.299 --> 01:49.801
It's the exact amount I gave her when I...

01:49.886 --> 01:51.887
When you tried to bribe her to stay.

01:54.307 --> 01:55.691
All right, we need to step
this up a notch, guys.

01:55.808 --> 01:57.025
Okay, what are we going to do?

01:57.143 --> 01:58.277
Let's brainstorm.

01:58.394 --> 01:59.645
How do we do an Amber alert?

01:59.812 --> 02:01.063
That's for child abductions.

02:01.147 --> 02:02.364
I'm thinking outside the box.

02:02.482 --> 02:04.149
Stepping back into the box for a moment,

02:04.284 --> 02:06.702
should we call her mother?

02:06.819 --> 02:09.204
I was hoping we'd find her
before having to make that call.

02:09.322 --> 02:12.291

02:30.977 --> 02:33.145
- She's with dad.
- I stand by my question.

02:33.263 --> 02:34.513
He said she's upset, embarrassed,

02:34.647 --> 02:36.565
and made him promise not
to tell us where she is,

02:36.683 --> 02:39.234
but she's okay. She's okay.

02:39.352 --> 02:40.936

extra amazing this morning.

11:07.437 --> 11:08.437
Aw, thanks.

11:08.522 --> 11:09.972
Well, it's an extra special day.

11:10.107 --> 11:13.476
We are always on the same page.

11:13.560 --> 11:17.530
There's something I want
to talk to you guys about.

11:17.648 --> 11:20.199
- Us?
- Oh, okay.

11:20.317 --> 11:22.068
Cool.

11:28.492 --> 11:30.993
Our sessions, here together
in a domestic setting,

11:31.128 --> 11:32.795
have been so productive.

11:32.913 --> 11:35.998
I feel it could be a new
model for my practice.

11:36.133 --> 11:37.500
Oh.

11:37.668 --> 11:39.335
What do you think about me joining Hankmed?

11:45.592 --> 11:48.844
I think that's a very intriguing idea, Bob.

11:48.929 --> 11:53.182
Very intriguing, but if
you did become a colleague,

11:53.317 --> 11:55.351
we'd probably have to adjust
our therapeutic relationship.

11:55.485 --> 11:56.903
Good point.

11:57.020 --> 12:00.323
Right, otherwise, it would be a conflict.

12:00.440 --> 12:02.158
Right, Bob?

12:02.242 --> 12:03.659
If this comes to pass,

12:03.777 --> 12:06.095
I'm sure we could work out the details.

12:08.115 --> 12:09.532
If there is one thing I hate,

12:09.700 --> 12:12.001
it is someone talking when
I'm trying to interrupt them.

12:12.119 --> 12:16.088
Now listen, I overpay
you to give me results,

12:16.206 --> 12:18.040
not excuses.

12:18.175 --> 12:20.126
Next time, before you knock up your wife,

12:20.260 --> 12:21.844
take a look at the calendar

12:21.929 --> 12:24.046
and keep earnings season in mind.

12:26.883 --> 12:30.886
So you're the doctor my
little brother used to work?

12:31.054 --> 12:33.055
And you're his twin brother.

12:33.140 --> 12:36.058
Older by three minutes and 13 seconds.

12:36.193 --> 12:38.060
Paul said three minutes, 12 seconds.

12:38.228 --> 12:41.113
I'm sure he did.

12:41.231 --> 12:43.532
Danny, nephropathy's a serious thing.

12:43.617 --> 12:45.868
Your brother's a willing donor,
and he's worried about you.

12:45.986 --> 12:47.486
I'm touched.

12:47.571 --> 12:49.238
Why are you resisting his help?

12:49.406 --> 12:51.407
Because it's a trap.

12:51.575 --> 12:53.576
A trap?

12:53.710 --> 12:55.211
He only wants to give me his kidney

12:55.329 --> 12:57.296
because I fronted him
the cash for med school.

12:57.414 --> 12:59.131
He thinks this will settle him up.

12:59.249 --> 13:01.050
[Chuckles]

13:01.168 --> 13:02.585
You can't possibly believe that.

13:02.753 --> 13:04.920
Well, it's what I would do.

13:05.088 --> 13:07.506
V.D.'s smart, but you know who's smarter?

13:07.641 --> 13:08.591
D.V.D.

13:08.725 --> 13:10.092
Wow.

13:10.260 --> 13:11.394
Aside from the fact

13:11.511 --> 13:13.095
that you both refer to
yourselves by acronyms

13:13.180 --> 13:15.765
and in the third person, you
two are pretty different.

13:15.932 --> 13:17.233
Well, not that different.

13:17.351 --> 13:18.768
In fact, you're a lot
like your brother seemed

13:18.902 --> 13:20.069
before I got to know him.

13:20.187 --> 13:21.771
Hmm. A little douchey?

13:21.905 --> 13:23.522
- Yeah.
- I get that a lot.

13:23.657 --> 13:26.158
I'm crying all the way to the
bank I just bought 25% of.

13:26.276 --> 13:27.860
Ah.

13:27.995 --> 13:30.029
Look, don't let Paul worry you, okay?

13:30.163 --> 13:31.947
I have the most expensive
nephrologist in New York, so...

13:32.082 --> 13:33.366
Yeah, but according to your chart

13:33.500 --> 13:34.750
you haven't seen him since January.

13:34.835 --> 13:36.452
Well, I'm a busy guy. Agh!

13:36.620 --> 13:39.755
A busy guy with back pain. How bad is it?

13:39.873 --> 13:43.209
It's not enough to slow me down.

13:43.343 --> 13:45.795
Between that and your swollen ankles

13:45.962 --> 13:47.797
it looks like the
nephropathy is progressing.

13:47.964 --> 13:49.265
Danny, I want to do a full exam,

13:49.383 --> 13:51.017
including a donor compatibility check

13:51.134 --> 13:52.768
to see if you and your brother are a match.

13:52.886 --> 13:54.553
I don't have time for that.

13:54.688 --> 13:56.939
Do you have time for
dialysis three days a week?

13:57.057 --> 13:58.774
'Cause that's where you're headed.

13:58.859 --> 14:00.526
And I'm guessing that would especially suck

14:00.644 --> 14:03.529
during earnings season.

14:10.469 --> 14:11.969
Yeah, dad, we left a bunch of messages.

14:12.137 --> 14:13.137
Please call us back.

14:13.271 --> 14:15.639
We just want to talk to Emma. Thank you.

14:17.976 --> 14:19.643
He's not going to tell
us where she is, is he?

14:19.811 --> 14:23.280
Well, look, Emma's safe, you know?

14:23.398 --> 14:25.816
We can't force him to tell
us any more than that.

14:28.403 --> 14:31.989
Speaking of prying
information out of people,

14:32.157 --> 14:33.991
why don't you want to join
Boris's board of directors?

14:34.126 --> 14:36.827
Ev, I really don't feel like...

14:36.912 --> 14:38.245
Please, I just want to understand.

14:38.380 --> 14:39.663
No, you just want to talk me into it.

14:39.798 --> 14:42.383
No, I-I...

14:42.501 --> 14:44.835
Okay, try me.

14:44.970 --> 14:46.253
I mean it.

14:46.388 --> 14:49.256
Okay, okay.

14:51.843 --> 14:56.180
With Boris, nothing's ever
as simple as it seems.

14:56.314 --> 14:59.016
I mean, everything is just a rabbit hole.

15:00.819 --> 15:02.319
And the last thing I
want right now is to get

15:02.437 --> 15:04.688
sucked back into a hospital bureaucracy.

15:04.856 --> 15:07.024
But that would never happen. I-I promise...

15:07.109 --> 15:08.159
And now you're talking me into it.

15:08.276 --> 15:09.577
- Henry...
- Evan!

15:09.694 --> 15:11.862
You don't understand my
relationship with Boris.

15:11.997 --> 15:13.998
This is stuff between me and him,

15:14.116 --> 15:19.203
so please, just... Just stay out of it.

15:21.590 --> 15:25.459
Wow, okay, consider me out of it, but Hank,

15:25.544 --> 15:28.345
this is something I need
to do, with or without you.

15:28.463 --> 15:29.630
I'm building a life with Paige now.

15:29.714 --> 15:31.682
I can't pass up golden
opportunities like this.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.217
Well, I never asked you to pass it up,

15:33.351 --> 15:34.602
- and I never would ask.
- I know that.

15:34.719 --> 15:37.938
I'm not... [Sighs]

15:38.056 --> 15:40.941
I'm just afraid that what you don't want,

15:41.059 --> 15:42.943
and what I really want is about to lead us

15:43.061 --> 15:45.062
in two completely different directions,

15:45.230 --> 15:48.482
and that would be a real shame, right?

15:48.567 --> 15:50.451
Especially if there was a way to avoid it

15:50.569 --> 15:54.655
or a way to at least, like,
work through it together.

15:54.739 --> 15:58.125
Yeah.

15:58.243 --> 16:00.494
Unfortunately, there's not.

16:04.833 --> 16:07.885
Okay. All right.

16:08.003 --> 16:09.753
We should probably be more focused on Emma

16:09.921 --> 16:13.507
- right now anyway.
- Yeah, yeah.

16:14.809 --> 16:16.894
Do you want to go to Arizona next week?

16:16.978 --> 16:18.762
What? Why?

16:18.930 --> 16:21.015
That's where dad's book tour resumes.

16:21.149 --> 16:24.185
I figure we just go out there
and casually bump into Emma.

16:24.319 --> 16:26.237
Uh, I don't know about that.

16:26.354 --> 16:28.939
We just can't let too much
time pass before we see her.

16:29.074 --> 16:33.277
That's how family disagreements
turn into family rifts.

16:33.411 --> 16:35.112
Okay, we could do that. It's just...

16:35.280 --> 16:37.615
Dad told me yesterday his
next book signing was today.

16:37.749 --> 16:41.252
He doesn't have one today,
unless he added some dates.

16:41.369 --> 16:42.786
I mean...

16:44.506 --> 16:47.091
He's at the corner bookstore this afternoon.

16:47.175 --> 16:49.460
What? He's... he's in Manhattan.

16:49.628 --> 16:50.544
So we know where he's staying.

16:50.679 --> 16:51.795
Which means we know where Emma is.

17:13.984 --> 17:18.071
- There it is, good old 2031.
- Yup.

17:18.205 --> 17:20.624
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
We should have a plan B.

17:20.742 --> 17:22.376
You bring that up after we drive to the city

17:22.493 --> 17:24.078
- and I knock on the door?
- Okay, we still have time.

17:24.212 --> 17:26.463
- We don't have time.
- Just...

17:26.580 --> 17:29.083
- [Sighs]
- Hi.

17:29.217 --> 17:30.501
Eddie told you where I am?

17:30.669 --> 17:32.753
No, no. Emma, he didn't betray you.

17:32.887 --> 17:34.638
He doesn't even know we're here.

17:34.756 --> 17:36.340
Then how did you find me?

17:36.424 --> 17:37.558
Look, we'll explain everything.

17:37.676 --> 17:40.477
Can we just... can we come in?

17:40.595 --> 17:43.480
Please?

17:48.820 --> 17:51.522
We used to stay here with
dad when we were kids,

17:51.690 --> 17:54.191
even though he was spending
money he didn't have.

17:54.326 --> 17:56.944
We always stayed in this suite,

17:57.078 --> 18:01.115
and the burger was always the highlight.

18:01.249 --> 18:04.118
I'm not hungry.

18:05.920 --> 18:10.341
I know how you feel.

18:10.425 --> 18:12.960
I know why you ran away.

18:13.094 --> 18:16.630
Nothing feels worse than
disappointing family.

18:16.765 --> 18:18.382
Trust me, I know.

18:18.550 --> 18:20.551
I've been disappointing Hank for years.

18:28.777 --> 18:34.148
My mom never really expected much of me,

18:34.232 --> 18:38.452
so I never let her down,

18:38.570 --> 18:41.238
and you guys should be disappointed.

18:41.406 --> 18:45.376
I broke your trust, again.

18:45.460 --> 18:46.910
I just... I can't believe

18:46.995 --> 18:51.498
all of the stupid stuff I did this summer.

18:51.633 --> 18:55.552
I was just... so desperate to fit in.

18:55.670 --> 18:58.005
Wow.

18:58.089 --> 19:02.393
Well, no one gets that last part
better than I do, but, Emma,

19:02.510 --> 19:06.096
you've made us proud way
more than you let us down.

19:06.231 --> 19:08.932
Proud of how smart and determined

19:09.067 --> 19:10.601
and independent you are.

19:10.769 --> 19:12.236
Proud that you went out and got a job,

19:12.354 --> 19:16.023
like, the moment you got
here, an unglamorous one.

19:16.157 --> 19:18.442
Proud of how you jumped in
during medical emergencies.

19:18.576 --> 19:21.111
And proud that, even
though you came to New York

19:21.279 --> 19:23.414
this summer to tell Eddie
you didn't need him...

19:23.498 --> 19:25.449
He's the one you turn to now.

19:27.118 --> 19:29.753
'Cause that's what family is,

19:29.871 --> 19:33.924
people you depend on when
you run out of better options.

19:34.042 --> 19:37.678
[Laughs]

19:37.796 --> 19:41.882
Wow, when you guys gang up,
there is really no stopping you.

19:41.966 --> 19:43.434
[Both laughing]

19:44.969 --> 19:46.470
[Laughs]

19:56.147 --> 19:58.148
Oh. Hey, Jeremiah.

19:58.316 --> 20:01.819
So you're eating that all by yourself?

20:01.953 --> 20:03.987
I don't intend to finish it.

20:04.155 --> 20:06.740
Though if I do, my picture
goes up on the wall inside.

20:06.875 --> 20:08.409
[Laughs]

20:08.493 --> 20:10.994
Oh, hey, have you set up
an interview with Bob yet?

20:11.162 --> 20:13.130
That won't be necessary.

20:13.248 --> 20:15.165
You're hiring him without an interview?

20:15.300 --> 20:16.633
We're not hiring him at all.

20:16.751 --> 20:19.253
I just found out he's not
licensed or credentialed.

20:19.337 --> 20:21.922
- What?
- I left Evan a voice-mail.

20:22.056 --> 20:23.674
Hi, can I get you

20:23.808 --> 20:26.093
a Carol's super gigantic fun day sundae too?

20:26.227 --> 20:28.562
I'm good, thanks.

20:28.680 --> 20:30.347
Hold on.

20:30.515 --> 20:35.436
So we've been baring our
soul to just some guy?

20:35.520 --> 20:37.438
How did you find Bob?

20:37.572 --> 20:41.692
Well, Evan found him... online.

20:41.860 --> 20:44.528
Did he ever say he was a doctor?

20:44.696 --> 20:48.198
No. Ohh.

20:48.366 --> 20:50.868
In fact, he insisted we call him Bob,

20:51.002 --> 20:53.537
but I just figured he was
trying to make us comfortable.

20:53.671 --> 20:55.172
If it makes you feel
any better, he does have

20:55.256 --> 20:57.708
an undergraduate degree
from Concordia University.

20:57.842 --> 21:00.127
Yeah? A degree in what?

21:00.261 --> 21:03.797
- Theater.
- Mm.

21:03.932 --> 21:06.049
I'm sorry if you feel deceived.

21:09.354 --> 21:11.855
You know what?

21:11.940 --> 21:14.391
I don't.

21:14.526 --> 21:18.479
Evan and I never cared
about Bob's credentials.

21:18.613 --> 21:20.481
We just cared about getting help,

21:20.615 --> 21:25.619
and he definitely gave us that, big time.

21:27.572 --> 21:30.741
He changed our lives.

21:30.909 --> 21:32.576
We'd go to him all over again.

21:36.080 --> 21:37.998
Well, that's a medically inadvisable

21:38.132 --> 21:39.333
portion of ice cream.

21:39.467 --> 21:41.552
Mmm.

21:41.669 --> 21:44.087
I'll get your picture up on that wall.

21:53.014 --> 21:56.266
- Oh, my gosh.
- Whoa.

21:56.434 --> 21:57.651
Did you know dad was this popular?

21:57.769 --> 21:59.102
No, but knowing dad he could've paid

21:59.237 --> 22:02.906
all these people to be here. [Laughs]

22:02.991 --> 22:05.609
Oh, you were... you were serious.

22:05.693 --> 22:08.445
- A little bit.
- Kind of.

22:08.530 --> 22:11.281
So, Emma, after this, we'll
head back to the Hamptons?

22:11.366 --> 22:14.618
Oh, actually, I had another idea.

22:14.786 --> 22:16.537
Oh, really, and what was that?

22:16.671 --> 22:20.541
Well, I was thinking maybe
I could go with Eddie.

22:20.675 --> 22:22.376
On the last leg of his book tour?

22:22.510 --> 22:23.927
Yeah, yeah.

22:24.045 --> 22:25.629
I mean, I've really enjoyed
getting to know him,

22:25.797 --> 22:27.965
and I want to know him better.

22:28.099 --> 22:31.969
I mean, as well as I know you guys now.

22:32.103 --> 22:33.470
And I don't know, I was thinking

22:33.605 --> 22:35.939
maybe it would help me
get to know myself better.

22:36.057 --> 22:38.559
- I think it's a great idea.
- Really?

- Hi, sweetie.

extremely ready for you inside.

She's working on a visitation plan for Rafa,

I'm sure if you talk to
your doctor over there,

23:58.473 --> 24:00.023
he'll explain that to you.

24:00.141 --> 24:02.059
Got to go.

Always great catching up, Katdare.

Mm-hmm.

- Hey.

24:07.865 --> 24:09.816
I knew you'd convince him
to get the transplant.

24:09.951 --> 24:11.485
Oh, he hasn't agreed to it yet.

24:11.569 --> 24:13.236
Yeah, but he's already listening to you.

24:13.371 --> 24:15.205
He needs to hear it
from an authority figure,

24:15.323 --> 24:17.240
not just his bumbling little bro.

24:17.375 --> 24:19.493
Ah! [Winces]

24:19.627 --> 24:21.078

24:21.212 --> 24:23.580
Ah, not enough to slow me down.

24:23.715 --> 24:26.967
I assume you got that expression from Danny.

24:27.085 --> 24:29.553
We both got it from our dad.

24:29.671 --> 24:32.472
He used to say it during his dizzy spells.

24:32.590 --> 24:34.224
He passed away when we were in high school.

24:34.342 --> 24:38.562
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

24:38.680 --> 24:41.181
Any idea what was causing his dizzy spells?

24:41.265 --> 24:45.736
- Hypertension.
- Hmm.

24:45.820 --> 24:49.406
Paul, did your dad have any kidney problems?

24:49.524 --> 24:53.860
I mean, he got up four
times a night to pee, but...

24:53.995 --> 24:58.782
Wait, you think that my
back pain is kidney related,

24:58.916 --> 25:03.503
and that my dad had nephropathy,
just like my brother?

25:03.621 --> 25:04.788
Well, I'm just...

25:04.956 --> 25:06.623
I never even thought about it before,

25:06.791 --> 25:10.594
but nephropathy can
manifest in very subtle ways,

25:10.678 --> 25:12.629
and it can have a genetic component.

25:12.797 --> 25:15.382
I mean, obviously, we won't know for
sure until we get a kidney biopsy, but...

25:15.516 --> 25:20.470

will Danny get a kidney?

25:28.279 --> 25:29.146
Right.

what Emma needed to hear.

to scandalous conclusions.

at talking people into things.

Why do you think he's
been hounding me so much?

- I'm so glad you asked.
- I'm sure you are.

27:05.973 --> 27:07.590
that Evan's always been shut out of,

27:07.725 --> 27:09.676

he's trying to talk you
into is letting him in.

looked at it that way.
