00:20.617 --> 00:21.742
All right!

00:21.767 --> 00:23.097
It's Friday.

00:23.122 --> 00:24.853
When you think about it,
today is the week's butt.

00:24.886 --> 00:26.676
And Dad has a weak butt.

00:26.719 --> 00:28.929
Dad? Talking about your butt? No?

00:28.955 --> 00:31.265
Dad, please pay attention
when we're sassing you.

00:31.290 --> 00:32.520
Oh. Uh, thank you.

00:32.665 --> 00:34.706
Okay, kids. Better get to school.

00:35.048 --> 00:36.346
Bob, hello?

00:36.376 --> 00:37.692
Aren't you gonna say bye to the kids?

00:37.716 --> 00:39.126
Oh, right. Uh, bye.

00:39.176 --> 00:40.586
Uh, thanks for coming in.

00:40.636 --> 00:42.506
- He said lovingly.
- Bob.

00:42.556 --> 00:43.726
- Hmm?
- Are you okay?

00:43.756 --> 00:45.346
You just told the kids goodbye

00:45.426 --> 00:46.992
like they were customers
leaving the restaurant.

00:47.016 --> 00:48.476
Huh. I must be a little tired.

00:48.516 --> 00:50.016
Well, drink some more coffee, mister.

00:50.056 --> 00:51.606
I've already had three cups.

00:51.646 --> 00:54.016
My heart is going like a
little hummingbird. I like it.

00:54.066 --> 00:55.776
It's like a little
drum circle in my chest.

00:55.816 --> 00:56.936
Bum! Ba-bum-bum-bum.

00:56.960 --> 00:58.540
Ba-bum-bum-bum. Ba-bum-bum-bum.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.316
So, turns out,

01:00.356 --> 01:02.696
it's not shingles. I just
have gross skin on my back.

01:02.736 --> 01:04.696
- Hmm.
- That's great, Teddy.

01:04.736 --> 01:06.703
Hey, hey, Bob, can you top me off?

01:06.728 --> 01:08.196
Bob. Bob!

01:08.246 --> 01:09.786
You're pouring ketchup in my coffee.

01:09.826 --> 01:11.116
Oh, my God. Oh, sorry.

01:11.166 --> 01:13.536
Geez. I mean, it might taste good.

01:13.586 --> 01:15.996
No, that's... Ugh, that is gross.

01:17.796 --> 01:19.256
Wait, let me try it again.

01:19.672 --> 01:20.796
Ugh. No.

01:20.836 --> 01:22.796
Eh. Why'd I do that? Ugh.

01:22.846 --> 01:24.106
Unless...

01:24.136 --> 01:27.096
- No. No. No, no, no.
- Teddy, stop.

01:27.136 --> 01:28.806
What's going on with you today, Bob?

01:28.846 --> 01:29.992
You're totally out of it.

01:30.017 --> 01:32.096
I-I'm fine.
It-It's just, um...

01:32.146 --> 01:34.396
What, uh, what was
everyone talking about?

01:34.436 --> 01:36.106
- Teddy's nasty back skin.
- Oh.

01:36.161 --> 01:39.001
I think I'll go back
in the kitchen. Bye-bye.

01:39.026 --> 01:41.276
- What's his deal?
- I don't know. He's...

01:41.316 --> 01:42.856
Oh, no!

01:42.906 --> 01:44.656
-What?
-He might be getting his burnout.

01:44.696 --> 01:46.076
- Remember?
- Oh, no.

01:46.116 --> 01:48.656
Not the burnout. The
last one was so weird.

01:48.696 --> 01:50.156
It's fine. It's fine.

01:50.206 --> 01:51.916
It's fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:51.956 --> 01:53.036
Hey, Bob.

01:53.076 --> 01:54.562
Hi, Leslie!

01:54.586 --> 01:56.522
Now that I think about
it, he hasn't had a day off

01:56.546 --> 01:58.056
- since Easter.
- Have you?

01:58.086 --> 01:59.416
Yeah, yeah, I sneak 'em in.

01:59.466 --> 02:01.096
Last weekend I took Gene to the mall

02:01.126 --> 02:02.546
to visit an outfit he likes.

02:02.571 --> 02:04.281
Sheesh. I'm worried, Linda. I'm worried.

02:04.306 --> 02:05.936
Okay, okay, don't panic.

02:05.961 --> 02:08.120
I'll keep an eye on him
today, see how it goes.

02:18.303 --> 02:19.563
Perfect.

02:20.541 --> 02:22.211
Hi. How was school?

02:22.236 --> 02:25.776
We had a spelling test,
and I think I did B-A-D-D.

02:25.841 --> 02:28.051
Okay, okay, okay, okay,

02:28.076 --> 02:30.696
okay, okay, okay, okay.

02:30.746 --> 02:32.706
Um, who's Dad talking to back there?

02:32.746 --> 02:35.996
Your dad's just having
an interesting day.

02:36.036 --> 02:36.956
"You're acting weird."

02:36.996 --> 02:38.166
No, you're acting weird.

02:38.206 --> 02:39.746
"You just put mustard on me.

02:39.796 --> 02:41.206
I'm not supposed to have mustard."

02:41.256 --> 02:43.216
I know what you have
on you. I invented you.

02:45.086 --> 02:46.586
"Here we go."

02:46.636 --> 02:48.556
Uh, I'll just go back
there and check on him.

02:48.596 --> 02:50.192
Now I'm gonna put
tons of mustard on you!

02:50.216 --> 02:51.362
What do you think about that?!

02:51.386 --> 02:53.886
- Whoa.
- Yeah, he's got the burnout.

02:53.935 --> 02:54.975
I'm sorry.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.765
We got to get him to
take the day off tomorrow.

02:56.821 --> 02:59.081
Let's kiss. Just a little kiss.

02:59.106 --> 03:01.165
And I think I know what we should do.

03:01.190 --> 03:02.520
Poison him.

03:07.369 --> 03:08.289
Linda?

03:09.469 --> 03:10.286
Lin?

03:10.326 --> 03:11.616
Kids?

03:12.994 --> 03:14.414
Hello?

03:17.286 --> 03:19.492
What are you guys doing
down here so early?

03:20.141 --> 03:21.876
The-the door's locked.

03:21.916 --> 03:23.586
Guys, seriously, open the door.

03:23.641 --> 03:25.191
I'm afraid not, Bob.

03:25.216 --> 03:26.716
This is your outer-vention.

03:26.756 --> 03:27.639
What?!

03:27.664 --> 03:29.530
You got to stay out of
the restaurant today.

03:29.556 --> 03:31.896
You're getting a day off
whether you like it or not.

03:31.926 --> 03:33.346
No!

03:36.686 --> 03:39.396
- Let me in.
- No! You need a day off.

03:39.436 --> 03:41.316
- Kids, open the door.
- Get out of here, Dad.

03:41.356 --> 03:42.976
We don't want you. Go on, get.

03:43.026 --> 03:44.502
Until tonight. Please come back tonight.

03:44.526 --> 03:46.816
Fine. I'll just go get the extra keys.

03:46.856 --> 03:48.856
- No!
- We're setting you free, Dad.

03:48.881 --> 03:50.631
Go! Run with the other men.

03:50.656 --> 03:52.076
We are not letting you in.

03:52.116 --> 03:54.865
You have to go have fun.
Do something relaxing.

03:54.866 --> 03:56.071
Never!

03:56.416 --> 03:58.506
The back. Kids, go.

04:01.430 --> 04:03.600
No, no, no, no, no! No!

04:03.625 --> 04:04.795
Let me work!

04:04.828 --> 04:06.210
No way, mister.

04:06.235 --> 04:07.716
There's a bun delivery today, Lin.

04:07.771 --> 04:10.780
I-I need to be here to
check if they're all okay.

04:10.805 --> 04:12.191
We've got your buns covered, Dad.

04:12.216 --> 04:15.176
Let me in and I promise I'll
take the day off tomorrow.

04:15.226 --> 04:17.216
No! This is for your own good!

04:17.241 --> 04:18.781
I'll just keep pounding, then.

04:18.805 --> 04:21.356
You'll never get rid of me.

04:21.380 --> 04:24.676
- _
- I'm still here.

04:26.606 --> 04:27.856
Mr. Fischoeder. He'll have keys.

04:28.015 --> 04:30.185
Uh, Mr. Fischoeder! Wait!

04:34.297 --> 04:36.374
M-Mr. Fischoeder.

04:36.399 --> 04:38.956
Uh, thank you for stopping...

04:38.996 --> 04:43.030
so, so far away from when
you first heard me yelling.

04:43.055 --> 04:45.468
Bob, what are you doing running
after me like a crazy person?

04:45.508 --> 04:47.848
Oh, I-I need, uh,
keys to the restaurant.

04:47.873 --> 04:49.463
- Linda won't let me in.
- Oh.

04:49.503 --> 04:52.383
Well, we all knew this day
would come. Good for her.

04:52.463 --> 04:55.003
No, no, no. I-It's not that.
It's just I want to work,

04:55.053 --> 04:57.430
and she's forcing me
to take the day off.

04:57.455 --> 05:00.763
You want to work? At that restaurant?

05:00.803 --> 05:02.183
Uh, yes.

05:02.223 --> 05:03.683
Bob. Bob, Bob, Bob. Get in.

05:03.723 --> 05:05.263
I've got something I want to show you.

05:05.288 --> 05:08.128
Wait, hold on. First let
me put down a Wee-Wee Pad.

05:08.183 --> 05:09.643
Linda.

05:09.693 --> 05:11.732
Oh, hi, Mudflap. How are you?

05:11.757 --> 05:13.474
I'm great. Family's great.

05:13.499 --> 05:16.113
Got my back tattoo
removed. Put it on my front.

05:16.153 --> 05:17.969
- I hear that.
- Can I get you something to eat?

05:17.993 --> 05:19.623
Actually, I was wondering

05:19.653 --> 05:21.703
if I could have a
surprise baby shower here.

05:21.743 --> 05:23.993
- It's for my friend Goldie.
- Aw!

05:24.033 --> 05:26.333
Goldie's in a different
gang, the Easy Beavers.

05:26.373 --> 05:28.333
Anyway, she deserves a great shower,

05:28.373 --> 05:30.503
and this is the only
nice restaurant I know.

05:30.543 --> 05:31.963
So, what do you think?

05:32.003 --> 05:33.869
Of course. When is it gonna be?

05:33.894 --> 05:35.368
- Like, in an hour.
- Today?!

05:35.423 --> 05:36.883
That's what I put on the Evites.

05:36.923 --> 05:39.923
Today is soon, but we can handle it.

05:39.973 --> 05:42.643
Right, kids? You want to help
put a baby shower together

05:42.683 --> 05:44.263
- in an hour or what?
- Or what.

05:44.303 --> 05:45.723
I'll call all the babies I know

05:45.763 --> 05:46.789
and tell them to get
their asses over here.

05:46.813 --> 05:48.233
And I'll call all the asses I know

05:48.273 --> 05:50.323
and tell them to get
their babies over here.

05:50.348 --> 05:53.598
Oh, here's a bunch of money
that is definitely not stolen

05:53.653 --> 05:55.323
to help cover the food and whatnot.

05:55.363 --> 05:56.453
All right.

05:56.478 --> 05:58.318
Go, go, shower rangers.

05:59.334 --> 06:01.153
Um, what's this for?

06:01.203 --> 06:03.333
It's for rolling, Bob.
You roll them down the hill

06:03.363 --> 06:05.453
and see if a car runs them over.

06:05.493 --> 06:08.203
Right. Uh, but why?

06:08.228 --> 06:10.398
B-Because it's fun, Bob.

06:10.423 --> 06:11.616
Try it.

06:14.149 --> 06:18.043
See?

06:18.093 --> 06:20.763
It seems like a waste of food, honestly.

06:20.803 --> 06:23.803
Exactly. Waste of food.
Waste of time. You get it.

06:23.843 --> 06:27.433
Doing nothing, Bob, is
really doing something.

06:27.473 --> 06:29.433
That literally makes no sense.

06:29.473 --> 06:31.353
Maybe you could just
give me the keys and...

06:31.393 --> 06:32.983

are a big, sexy boy, but...

07:54.683 --> 07:55.983
- Well, of course I am.
- Yeah.

07:56.023 --> 07:57.943
Now let's go do nothing somewhere else.

07:58.260 --> 08:00.613
Okay, I made a bunch of sliders.

08:00.653 --> 08:02.209
It's like baby hamburgers,
so it's perfect.

08:02.233 --> 08:03.629
Okay, Mom.

08:03.653 --> 08:05.233
I looked for dolls for the diaper relay.

08:05.283 --> 08:07.033
Found a couple of Tina's old ones,

08:07.073 --> 08:09.155
and then I got this butternut squash,

08:09.180 --> 08:10.083
Gene's pillow

08:10.123 --> 08:12.843
and a Halloween skeleton
that plays guitar.

08:12.873 --> 08:14.743
Great. Tina, are you
done mushing up stuff

08:14.793 --> 08:16.333
for the baby food guessing game?

08:16.373 --> 08:18.003
Yep. I mushed my tush off.

08:18.043 --> 08:19.753
- Here she comes.
- Oh!

08:19.793 --> 08:21.423
Everybody hide. Hide!

08:23.358 --> 08:25.210
Surprise!

08:25.235 --> 08:27.473
Oh, God! What the hell is this?

08:27.513 --> 08:29.013
It's your baby shower.

08:29.973 --> 08:32.513
Oh, God, no. No.

08:32.553 --> 08:34.933
- No, no, no, no.
- Are those happy tears?

08:35.058 --> 08:36.938
I do not think so, Linda.

08:38.196 --> 08:39.457
Felix. Grover.

08:39.482 --> 08:41.153
Bob, this is Grover Fischoeder.

08:41.193 --> 08:42.863
He's our cousin and our lawyer.

08:42.903 --> 08:44.903
Oh. Uh, what-what is this place?

08:44.943 --> 08:48.493
Um, it is a private social club

08:48.533 --> 08:50.203
that is well within its rights

08:50.243 --> 08:53.493
to host any number of
animal strength contests.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.493
- Snail wrestling, Bob.
- I'm sorry, what?

08:55.543 --> 08:58.093
- Snail wrestling.
- Uh, if you're joining us,

08:58.123 --> 08:59.413
I will need you to sign a waiver.

08:59.463 --> 09:01.793
Have you ever had
diphtheria or Snail Tail?

09:01.833 --> 09:03.383
- Um, neither.
- What do you say, Bob?

09:03.423 --> 09:04.793
Care to snail?

09:04.843 --> 09:07.093
It's not nothing, but it's damn close.

09:07.133 --> 09:09.383
And it's just a thousand-dollar buy-in.

09:09.423 --> 09:10.933
Uh, you know what, Mr. Fischoeder,

09:10.972 --> 09:12.802
I'm gonna take what you said to heart.

09:12.843 --> 09:16.817
I'm gonna go try to enjoy my life.

09:16.842 --> 09:18.393
Have fun with your snails.

09:18.433 --> 09:20.973
What snails? Uh, no snails here.

09:20.998 --> 09:21.813
No.

09:21.853 --> 09:24.193
How dare you? Shame on you.

09:24.889 --> 09:27.533
- Goldie, what's going on?
- What do you mean?

09:27.573 --> 09:28.799
Well, you walked into your baby shower,

09:28.823 --> 09:30.363
we all yelled "surprise,"

09:30.403 --> 09:31.639
and then you started crying tears

09:31.663 --> 09:33.423
of genuine emotional sadness.

09:33.453 --> 09:35.573
I did not! You take that back.

09:35.623 --> 09:37.203
Okay, okay.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.203
- So, you're not sad?
- Who's this?

09:39.253 --> 09:41.293
That's Linda. I had my
baby in her restaurant.

09:41.333 --> 09:42.793
This restaurant right here.

09:42.833 --> 09:44.957
Right there in that booth, actually.

09:44.982 --> 09:46.562
Nah. I'm gonna call her Two Boobs.

09:46.587 --> 09:48.383
All right. So, do you want to go ahead

09:48.423 --> 09:51.343
with this party that we've
been planning for months?

09:51.383 --> 09:53.671
Yeah, sure. Uh, you know,

09:53.696 --> 09:55.632
I-I love to party. Hell, yeah.

09:55.657 --> 09:57.671
But no having your baby in
the booth. One was enough.

09:57.696 --> 09:59.196
Copy that, Two Boobs.

10:04.024 --> 10:05.563
Wow, maybe this is nice,

10:05.777 --> 10:07.487
taking a day off.

10:08.783 --> 10:09.703
My buns.

10:10.087 --> 10:11.373
I-I'll just pop in

10:11.403 --> 10:14.073
and give them a quick touch and sniff.

10:17.376 --> 10:19.634
Wait! Aah!

10:27.212 --> 10:29.093
- Gah!
- Uh-oh, Joel.

10:29.133 --> 10:30.569
Looks like you've got
another bread perv.

10:30.593 --> 10:33.133
No, I... Wait. Wait,
wh-what's a bread perv?

10:33.183 --> 10:35.140
You know, one of those
guys who's into bread.

10:35.165 --> 10:37.070
I mean, really into bread.

10:37.103 --> 10:39.148
He's not a bread perv. That's Bob.

10:39.173 --> 10:41.313
- I know him. He's a customer.
- Just because you know him

10:41.353 --> 10:43.898
-doesn't mean he's not a bread perv.
-Oh, true.

10:43.923 --> 10:45.843
- Wait, bread pervs are real?
- Too real.

10:45.868 --> 10:48.047
Bob, what were you doing to these rolls?

10:48.072 --> 10:49.862
I-I-I
was, uh...

10:49.902 --> 10:52.612
smelling them and, um, touching them.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.072
- Bread perv.
- Through the plastic.

10:54.112 --> 10:55.952
Look, I missed my bread delivery today

10:55.992 --> 10:58.662
because my wife made me take
a day off from my restaurant,

10:58.702 --> 11:00.832
and so I was seeing if mine were in here

11:00.872 --> 11:02.859
so I could just check them out.

11:02.884 --> 11:04.578
I already dropped your buns off, Bob.

11:04.603 --> 11:07.143
Oh, man. If someone forced
me to take the day off,

11:07.183 --> 11:08.563
there'd be no one here.

11:08.603 --> 11:10.433
So you run this place all by yourself?

11:10.483 --> 11:12.733
Patricia's 77 Sandwiches?

11:12.773 --> 11:14.903
I got to get out of here.
That guy headed this way is

11:14.943 --> 11:17.503
-an actual bread perv.
-Oh, here, let me get that other one.

11:17.528 --> 11:20.613
-Oh. Thanks.
-Okay, that's all of it. I got to go.

11:20.653 --> 11:22.493
Hey, what do you guys have there?

11:22.525 --> 11:24.275
-Italian loaf? -Stay back!
- Get out of here!

11:24.322 --> 11:25.992
- Ciabatta?
- Get away from my bread!

11:26.033 --> 11:27.953
Do you really make all 77 sandwiches?

11:27.993 --> 11:29.793
Oh, no. I make 34.

11:29.833 --> 11:32.163
That's why I call it
Patricia's 77 Sandwiches.

11:32.213 --> 11:34.503
- Can I try one?
- Sure. What can I make you?

11:34.528 --> 11:36.868
Uh, I guess I'll have, uh, number 47.

11:36.923 --> 11:38.213
It's the turkey...

11:38.253 --> 11:39.633
Turkey, onions, dill cream cheese,

11:39.673 --> 11:40.843
cucumber, roasted peppers,

11:40.883 --> 11:42.763
and hummus on a black pepper roll.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.973
Wow. You have all 77 memorized?

11:44.998 --> 11:46.353
Course I have them memorized.

11:46.393 --> 11:48.513
I can barely remember
all my kids' names.

11:48.563 --> 11:51.183
You have kids? I didn't
know bread could reproduce.

11:51.233 --> 11:53.893
- Go! Go! Go! Go!
- Done!

11:53.943 --> 11:54.983
Two Boobs, check me.

11:55.008 --> 11:57.100
Diaper is on... the face.

11:57.126 --> 11:57.903
No winner.

11:57.950 --> 11:59.910
Check it again, woman.

11:59.943 --> 12:01.943
I mean, uh, I mean, yay! Great job!

12:01.993 --> 12:03.953
Uh, Goldie, you win. Yay!

12:03.993 --> 12:05.493
All right, all right!

12:05.533 --> 12:06.913
That's more like it!

12:06.953 --> 12:08.493
Oh, no, what's wrong?

12:08.533 --> 12:10.123
Are you going into labor?

12:10.163 --> 12:11.873
No. Course not. Uh,
this little passenger

12:11.913 --> 12:13.713
in my baby carriage is just giving me

12:13.753 --> 12:15.753
pretty fierce bottom ramen, you know?

12:15.793 --> 12:17.133
Wha... ? Wha-Wha-What's
she saying?

12:17.188 --> 12:18.648
It's biker for "diarrhea."

12:18.673 --> 12:20.593
Oh. Uh, there's the bathroom.

12:20.633 --> 12:22.713
Someone's in there... Not doing drugs.

12:22.763 --> 12:25.883
Oh. Okay, okay. Uh, go
to the employee bathroom.

12:25.933 --> 12:28.473
- Gene, show her where.
- Right this way, milady.

12:28.513 --> 12:31.013
Ooh, let's waddle along.

12:32.393 --> 12:34.813
Mmm. Wow. This is really good.

12:34.853 --> 12:37.313
- Uh, Patricia. Patricia.
- One sec, Bob.

12:37.363 --> 12:39.373
- This sandwich is really good.
- What's that?

12:39.403 --> 12:41.943
- I said this sandwich was...
- Um, excuse me, miss?

12:41.993 --> 12:44.163
- Right with you.
- Can I get some more napkins?

12:44.203 --> 12:46.009
- Uh, hey-hey, Patricia?
- Uh, kind of busy, Bob.

12:46.034 --> 12:48.124
- Is my to-go ready?
- Uh-huh. Yep.

12:48.163 --> 12:49.993
Patricia, you're
slammed. Let me help you.

12:50.033 --> 12:51.453
What? No, that's crazy.

12:51.493 --> 12:53.703
It's crazy not to let
me help you. Please.

12:53.753 --> 12:56.083
- Okay, fine.
- Yes! Give me an apron.

12:56.123 --> 12:58.059
-I'm ready to work.
-Now you're making me regret this.

12:58.083 --> 12:59.490
You're too excited, and
it's freaking me out.

12:59.515 --> 13:01.435
Sorry. Sorry. I-I'll be cool.

13:04.568 --> 13:06.779
-Oh, hey, Steve. You're a little bit early.
-Yeah.

13:06.803 --> 13:09.763
I thought I'd try the number
39 while I wait for a big date.

13:09.803 --> 13:12.974
Okay, so, a, a number 39 for Steve.

13:12.999 --> 13:14.733
Yeah. I'm officially halfway today.

13:14.773 --> 13:17.192
I've been working my
way through the menu.

13:17.193 --> 13:19.023
Wow. So you've been here 39 times?

13:19.063 --> 13:21.573
Yep. I do like the sandwiches, but, uh,

13:21.613 --> 13:24.743
I mainly kept coming back
'cause I wanted to ask her out.

13:24.783 --> 13:27.033
-It took a while.
-Had to make sure you weren't weird.

13:27.073 --> 13:29.573
Oh, I'm weird. Look.
This finger is too short.

13:29.623 --> 13:30.793
That's your thumb.

13:30.833 --> 13:32.633
Is it? Then what's this?

13:32.663 --> 13:35.753
- I... Oh, my God, I don't know.
- I don't know, either.

13:35.793 --> 13:38.253
- So, where are you taking me?
- I thought we could go ride

13:38.293 --> 13:39.793
the Ferris wheel after the lunch rush.

13:39.833 --> 13:41.753
I am not riding that death trap. No.

13:41.793 --> 13:44.093
No one has died on it
in at least a year-ish.

13:44.133 --> 13:46.633
I think someone fell off and
broke their leg last week,

13:46.673 --> 13:48.593
- but I-I won't tell her.
- Thanks.

13:48.633 --> 13:49.973
♪ ♪

13:50.013 --> 13:53.143
Well, you might want
to just seal that puppy off

13:53.183 --> 13:54.853
for a couple of years, Two Boobs.

13:54.893 --> 13:57.143
Who's ready for the
baby food eating contest?

13:57.193 --> 13:58.823
Okay, Tina, it's your time to shine.

13:58.853 --> 14:00.533
In these cups are three
different mashed...

14:00.558 --> 14:02.764
No... !

14:02.789 --> 14:04.458
Uh-oh. Diarrhea's back.

14:04.490 --> 14:06.701
Nope. I was lying about the diarrhea.

14:06.726 --> 14:09.258
I mean, not lying. It's
a whole bunch of things.

14:09.283 --> 14:10.863
But I've also been having contractions

14:10.913 --> 14:15.108
for the past 24 hou... rs... !

14:15.133 --> 14:17.108
- Oh, my God!
- Uh, Goldie, Linda,

14:17.133 --> 14:18.623
I'm kind of in the middle of my speech.

14:18.663 --> 14:21.116
Goldie, why didn't you
tell anyone you were labor?

14:21.141 --> 14:23.293
Because I'm
not ready to have this baby!

14:23.368 --> 14:26.028
That's why I was crying
earlier. I'm freaking out!

14:26.053 --> 14:27.553
Oh, this was all a mistake!

14:27.593 --> 14:29.423
I don't want to be a mom!

14:29.473 --> 14:31.369
Goldie, Goldie, Goldie, calm down.

14:31.393 --> 14:33.723
Hey! You see these
three kids right here?

14:33.763 --> 14:36.523
They all came out of me, and let
me tell you something, sister.

14:36.563 --> 14:38.531
- Yeah?
- I was not ready for 'em.

14:38.556 --> 14:40.031
Look, I get it.

14:40.056 --> 14:41.943
You got a tiny stranger
coming out of your vagina

14:41.983 --> 14:44.259
who's going to annoy you
for the rest of your life.

14:44.330 --> 14:46.403
But they'll also be the
thing you're proudest of.

14:46.443 --> 14:49.157
-We're a damn treat.
-I don't even wear diapers anymore.

14:49.182 --> 14:50.232
Brag!

14:50.287 --> 14:51.787
I wasn't ready for Sidecar,

14:51.812 --> 14:53.772
but I birthed him right
here in this booth,

14:53.804 --> 14:55.478
and now I would die for that kid.

14:55.503 --> 14:57.497
Okay, okay, so you're saying

14:57.547 --> 14:59.717
I don't have to be ready for the baby?

14:59.757 --> 15:01.557
It's all just super easy?

15:01.582 --> 15:03.462
Um, not really.

15:03.487 --> 15:05.617
But, uh, there's some
apps you can download,

15:05.642 --> 15:07.875
and, uh, I think somebody wrote a book.

15:07.900 --> 15:09.742
You'll figure it all out, right?

15:09.767 --> 15:12.945
Hey, if those three men could
have a baby, you'll be fine.

15:12.970 --> 15:15.657
Okay! I'm gonna stop trying

15:15.702 --> 15:18.322
to hold this sucker in!

15:18.357 --> 15:19.857
Okay.

15:19.897 --> 15:21.897
I-I think that's it. So, uh,

15:21.937 --> 15:24.390
you guys will be able to go
on your Ferris wheel date now.

15:24.415 --> 15:27.182
He... he seems nice. How
long have you been going out?

15:27.237 --> 15:29.327
Um, since whenever I
leave here with him.

15:29.367 --> 15:31.077
This will be our first date.

15:31.117 --> 15:32.827
Oh, can you grab that?

15:32.867 --> 15:34.367
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Bob's B...

15:34.417 --> 15:37.508
Oh. Uh, Patricia's 77 Sandwiches.

15:37.533 --> 15:39.587
Oh, okay, a catering
order. Uh, let me ask.

15:39.627 --> 15:41.457
Uh, how many sandwiches?

15:41.482 --> 15:43.492
Whoa. And when do you need them by?

15:43.517 --> 15:45.097
Okay, hold on. Let me check.

15:45.122 --> 15:46.140
- Patricia.
- Yeah.

15:46.165 --> 15:48.625
They went 77 sandwiches. One of each.

15:48.649 --> 15:50.306
It's for 40 minutes from now.

15:50.347 --> 15:52.387
What? That's, like,
two sandwiches a minute.

15:52.427 --> 15:53.887
So, should I say yes?

15:53.912 --> 15:56.212
No. I can't do that many
sandwiches that fast.

15:56.267 --> 15:58.437
But you've got help.
You-you can't say no to this.

15:58.477 --> 16:02.107
- I don't know.
- 77 sandwiches, Patricia.

16:02.147 --> 16:04.817
This is so exciting. This
is the sandwich Olympics.

16:04.857 --> 16:07.067
This is what we've been training for.

16:07.107 --> 16:09.617
Oh, my God. Okay, let's do it.

16:09.657 --> 16:12.336
Yes! 77 sandwiches!

16:12.377 --> 16:13.922
Oh, oh, oh, I got to tell the guy.

16:13.947 --> 16:15.287
Oh. Y-You heard all that?

16:15.327 --> 16:17.037
We're all doing this!

16:17.062 --> 16:20.022
Yes! All right, I got to go! I love you!

16:24.507 --> 16:26.007
- 33.
- 34.

16:26.032 --> 16:27.572
Okay, number 35. Salami, mozzarella,

16:27.597 --> 16:29.017
red pepper, olive tapenade.

16:29.042 --> 16:30.882
Got it. Oh, hey, Steve.
You need anything?

16:30.907 --> 16:34.287
Nope. Just, uh, I got to
head back to work soon, so...

16:34.387 --> 16:36.347
Right. Don't worry,
we're... we're almost done.

16:36.387 --> 16:38.227
- 36.
- Aah! Got ahead of me.

16:38.267 --> 16:40.097
- Catch up.
- I love this!

16:40.122 --> 16:41.622
- 51.
- 52!

16:41.647 --> 16:43.607
- 66.
- 67!

16:43.632 --> 16:45.882
And 68! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

16:45.987 --> 16:48.657
74. Whew! You are
breathing very hard, Bob.

16:48.697 --> 16:50.317
I know.

16:50.374 --> 16:52.414
It's alarming. I-I-I might be dying.

16:52.447 --> 16:54.117
But this is worth it.

16:54.157 --> 16:56.617
And... 77 sandwiches.

16:57.917 --> 16:58.837
Hi. I'm here to pick up the...

16:58.862 --> 17:01.452
- Whoa.
- Yes, yes. He's a mess.

17:01.497 --> 17:03.797
Do you, uh, do you need...

17:03.837 --> 17:07.107
- do you need help to your car?
- Uh, no, thanks. I'm good.

17:07.132 --> 17:10.071
Oh. Steve, did you,
uh, did you see that?

17:10.137 --> 17:12.357
Oh. Oh. Steve is gone.

17:12.387 --> 17:15.426
Oh... Right. Steve.

17:15.467 --> 17:18.767
He left a note. "Hey,
Patricia, you're great,

17:18.791 --> 17:20.962
"and I would have loved
to have gone out with you,

17:21.017 --> 17:22.767
"but I get that the
restaurant comes first.

17:22.817 --> 17:24.077
So I'll stop bugging you."

17:24.107 --> 17:26.107
Hmm. Seems like an overreaction.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.436
Well, I have stood him up before.

17:28.487 --> 17:30.986
A lot. 11 times, possibly.

17:30.987 --> 17:32.697
I guess that is a lot of times.

17:32.737 --> 17:34.407
What am I supposed to do...

17:34.447 --> 17:37.247
Take a day off every time
I want to go on a date?

17:37.287 --> 17:38.827
Oh. Oh, no. Oh, no.

17:38.867 --> 17:40.827
What? What? What? What?

17:40.877 --> 17:43.087
My family was right...
I did need a day off.

17:43.127 --> 17:44.417
And instead of taking one,

17:44.457 --> 17:46.337
I went and worked at
a different restaurant,

17:46.377 --> 17:48.547
and I got you into my craziness, too.

17:48.586 --> 17:50.216
Uh-uh, uh-uh. No, no, no, no, no.

17:50.257 --> 17:52.967
This is not your fault.
This restaurant is my life.

17:53.007 --> 17:55.807
I mean, someday maybe
I'll have 15 minutes

17:55.847 --> 17:57.927
to go out with a nice guy like Steve,

17:57.977 --> 17:59.432
but not right now.

17:59.457 --> 18:01.597
I put all my savings into this place.

18:01.647 --> 18:03.817
This is the only thing
I'm doing right now.

18:03.857 --> 18:05.357
Right, I-I totally get it.

18:05.397 --> 18:07.857
I just... all day
everyone's been telling me

18:07.897 --> 18:11.067
I needed a day off, and I-I
got mad, because I love to work,

18:11.107 --> 18:14.317
but they said that to me
because they care about me.

18:14.367 --> 18:17.487
And having someone in your
corner, well, that's what makes

18:17.537 --> 18:19.867
- doing all of this worth it.
- Oh, well,

18:19.907 --> 18:21.787
now you're gonna make
me cry, Bob. Great.

18:21.827 --> 18:23.957
Look, I'm not saying
you have to marry Steve,

18:23.997 --> 18:25.787
or any guy right now,
I'm just saying that

18:25.837 --> 18:28.247
I have one thing that's
more important to me

18:28.337 --> 18:30.957
than my restaurant,
and that's my family.

18:30.982 --> 18:34.637
Although a lot of times
that's very difficult.

18:34.677 --> 18:37.177
Mm. So you're saying I
ought to do that thing

18:37.217 --> 18:39.020
where I run and find Steve?

18:39.045 --> 18:40.295
I mean... yeah.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.070
Who's gonna clean up and close?

18:42.110 --> 18:43.780
- I'll-I'll close.
- You'd close for me?

18:43.820 --> 18:45.620
It's nasty in here.

18:45.660 --> 18:47.760
I didn't say I'd clean
up. I said I'd close.

18:47.785 --> 18:49.589
- Now, go.
- Okay, I'm going.

18:49.621 --> 18:52.547
Thanks, Bob. You're all
right for a bread perv.

18:52.580 --> 18:54.250
Where are the damn paramedics?!

18:54.290 --> 18:56.290
I'm sure they'll be here soon.

18:56.315 --> 18:57.695
You just keep breathing, Goldie.

18:59.090 --> 19:00.550
Oh, boy!

19:00.590 --> 19:02.880
- What? What? What?
- Get these pants off me,

19:02.930 --> 19:05.977
'cause this baby is
signaling for the off-ramp.

19:06.002 --> 19:08.252
Well, I guess we're
having another biker baby.

19:08.277 --> 19:10.657
Will it drive out on a tiny motorcycle?

19:10.682 --> 19:11.682
