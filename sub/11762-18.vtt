WEBVTT

00:01.232 --> 00:03.704
WELL, WHERE'S JULES?
THE SHOW'S ABOUT TO START.

00:03.704 --> 00:06.437
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GUYS
GET TOGETHER EVERY WEEK

00:06.437 --> 00:08.439
TO WATCH THIS CRAP.

00:08.439 --> 00:11.182
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
(chuckles) TRAVIS,
ONE OF THESE YOUNG SINGERS

00:11.182 --> 00:14.085
IS GOING TO BE
THIS COUNTRY'S NEXT IDOL.

00:14.085 --> 00:16.787
YOU HATE AMERICA, TRAVIS?
I DO.

00:16.787 --> 00:18.289
WHILE WE WAIT,

00:18.289 --> 00:21.152
WE SHOULD WATCH ANDY'S OLD
STAND-UP TAPE FROM COLLEGE.

00:21.152 --> 00:23.694
WHAT WAS YOUR CATCHPHRASE AGAIN?
(Spanish accent)
BITCHES BE LOCO.

00:23.694 --> 00:27.098
(laughs) IT'S FUNNY
'CAUSE IT'S TRUE.
YOU COULD'VE KILLED ME!

00:27.098 --> 00:30.030
OH, CALM DOWN.
NO, YOU CALM DOWN!

00:30.030 --> 00:33.234
SHE WAS TALKING ON HER PHONE
THE WHOLE TIME SHE WAS DRIVING.

00:33.234 --> 00:36.767
WE ALMOST HIT A COP.
IT WAS A CROSSING GUARD.
IF IT WAS A COP,

00:36.767 --> 00:39.340
I WOULD HAVE SLOWED DOWN
WHEN SHE STARTED CHASING US.

00:39.340 --> 00:42.173
YOU CAN BLOW THAT WHISTLE
ALL YOU WANT, SWEETIE.

00:42.173 --> 00:45.246
NO GUN, NO BRAKEY.
OPRAH SAYS TALKING ON YOUR CELL
WHILE YOU DRIVE

00:45.246 --> 00:49.080
IS CRAZY DANGEROUS.
DOES OPRAH SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT HOW LAME IT IS

00:49.080 --> 00:51.152
FOR GROWN-ASS MEN
TO WATCH "OPRAH"?

00:51.152 --> 00:54.125
NO. SHE LOVES US.
WHO WANTS WINE?

00:54.125 --> 00:55.826
YO!
ME!

00:55.826 --> 00:59.490
RIGHT HERE.
ALL RIGHT. THAT'S FIVE YESES
AND A "NICE TRY."

00:59.490 --> 01:01.832
LOOK, I HAVE TO TALK
ON MY CELL PHONE

01:01.832 --> 01:03.734
BECAUSE I'M
A REAL ESTATE AGENT.

01:03.734 --> 01:05.836
BESIDES,
I'M NOT AFRAID OF OPRAH.
(both gasp)

01:05.836 --> 01:08.199
SHE'S NOT A GOD.
TAKE THAT BACK.

01:08.199 --> 01:10.301
(Bobby) ANDY.
(Spanish accent)
BITCHES BE LOCO.

01:10.301 --> 01:12.303
(Bobby laughing)
(slurps) MMM.

01:12.303 --> 01:15.306
YOU KNOW, THEY SAY YOU CAN
GET FOUR GLASSES OF WINE

01:15.306 --> 01:18.709
OUT OF ONE BOTTLE. I ONLY
GET, LIKE, ONE AND A HALF.

01:18.709 --> 01:20.711
ALL RIGHT, COME AND GET IT.

01:20.711 --> 01:23.184
OH, HURRY.
SHOW'S ABOUT TO START!

01:23.184 --> 01:25.856
ALL RIGHT, HURRY.
LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GO,

01:25.856 --> 01:28.859
LET'S GO, LET'S GO!
ALL RIGHT, GUYS. WAIT, WAIT,
GUYS. NO--NO SPILLING.

01:28.859 --> 01:31.262
TRAVIS, YOU COMING?

01:31.262 --> 01:34.665
NOPE. I HAVE A LIFE.
(scoffs)

01:34.665 --> 01:36.767
(chuckles) EH!

01:36.767 --> 01:40.301
IF I FIND YOUR OTHER SHOE,
I'LL MAIL IT TO YOU.

01:40.301 --> 01:42.633
HURRY! COME HERE.
(Grayson) SEE YA.

01:46.677 --> 01:48.209
GO AHEAD.

01:48.209 --> 01:50.211
YOU KNOW, SHE'S SO YOUNG,

01:50.211 --> 01:52.213
SHE MIGHT ACTUALLY BE
FROM THE FUTURE.

01:52.213 --> 01:54.615
DOES HER DAD WORK
ON THE MOON?
THAT'S GREAT. CAN I GO NOW?

01:54.615 --> 01:57.248
MNH-MNH.
NOT TILL WE CELEBRATE.
GIRL CHEST BUMP.

01:57.248 --> 01:59.520
(both, singsongy) BING!

01:59.520 --> 02:01.892
AGAIN.

02:01.892 --> 02:03.324
OH, TOM.

02:03.324 --> 02:04.855
IT'S MY BIRTHDAY.

02:04.855 --> 02:06.697
DO IT FOR HIM.

02:06.697 --> 02:07.898
(both, singsongy) BING!

02:07.898 --> 02:11.202
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE HERE.

02:11.202 --> 02:14.205
WHAT'S THE BIG SURPRISE?

02:14.205 --> 02:16.907
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT HOW BAD
I'LL MISS YOU WHEN YOU GO OFF

02:16.907 --> 02:19.770
TO COLLEGE NEXT YEAR.
AH, YOU'VE GOT PICTURES OF HIM.

02:19.770 --> 02:22.873
LET'S FOCUS ON WHO'LL NEVER
LEAVE YA. BING! (laughs)

02:22.873 --> 02:26.377
THAT WAS THE PLAN,
THEN I SAW THIS DUDE. POW!

02:26.377 --> 02:27.918
(laughs)

02:27.918 --> 02:29.420
HOLY MOTHER!

02:29.420 --> 02:31.682
AW, YOU GOT A PONY!

02:31.682 --> 02:33.884
HEY, TRAVIS.
YOU LOOK A LITTLE HUNGRY.

02:33.884 --> 02:37.228
I NAME ALL MY FAVORITE THINGS
TRAVIS.

02:37.228 --> 02:39.159
I'M ODDLY FLATTERED.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.362
(growls)
OH! (chuckles) CALM DOWN,
BIG FELLA.

02:41.362 --> 02:45.466
BE CAREFUL FOR LITTLE TRAVIS.
YOU DON'T CALL ME TRAVIS.

02:45.466 --> 02:47.798
OH, I HATE TALKING TO YOU
WHILE YOU'RE DRIVING.

02:47.798 --> 02:51.372
PROMISE ME YOU'RE BEING SAFE.
I'M BEING TOTALLY SAFE.

02:51.372 --> 02:53.544
I'M KNEE-DRIVING.
JULES!

02:53.544 --> 02:56.707
HEY, I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE!
BUDDY. (makes clicking sound)

02:56.707 --> 02:58.909
(chuckles)

02:58.909 --> 03:00.681
WE BOTH DID FINGER GUNS.

03:00.681 --> 03:03.814
FOCUS, JULES. YOU'RE MEETING
WITH THE PETERSONS.

03:03.814 --> 03:06.787
REMEMBER, THEIR HOUSE
HAS THAT REALLY NICE--
FENCE!

03:08.619 --> 03:10.591
(tires screech)

03:22.202 --> 03:24.275
MR. AND MRS. PETERSON, HEY!

03:24.275 --> 03:26.777
LET ME TELL YOU
WHY I'M THE RIGHT PERSON

03:26.777 --> 03:28.839
TO SELL YOUR HOUSE.

03:28.839 --> 03:31.812
WHOA. LET ME GET
MY LISTING AGREEMENT.

03:33.244 --> 03:35.446
NOW THIS IS A GREAT MERLOT,

03:35.446 --> 03:37.948
AND I CAN SELL YOU A CASE OF IT
AT AN AMAZING PRICE.

03:37.948 --> 03:41.292
IT'S NICE, SARA, BUT THE NAME
IS THROWING ME--"HURPГ©S"?

03:41.292 --> 03:43.954
IT'S FRENCH. IT'S ER-PAY.

03:43.954 --> 03:46.727
LOOK, I'M GONNA PUT YOU DOWN
FOR THREE OF 'EM.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.959
AND, UH, I'LL THROW IN
AN EXTRA CASE

03:48.959 --> 03:52.232
IF YOU TAKE ME OUT FOR DINNER.
(chuckles) ARE YOU SERIOUS?

03:52.232 --> 03:53.704
(singsongy) BE CAREFUL.

03:53.704 --> 03:56.307
(normal voice)
CHECK OUT THE OUTFIT--

03:56.307 --> 03:59.009
LONG-SLEEVED SHIRT
WITH A T-SHIRT OVER IT.
DOES HE CHASE
AFTER YOUNG TAIL?

03:59.009 --> 04:03.844
HIS HOUSE IS LIKE A CLOWN CAR
FOR BARELY LEGAL BIMBOS.
DO YOU TWO KNOW EACH OTHER?

04:03.844 --> 04:06.377
NO. TELL YOU WHAT--IF YOU
EVER WANT TO HAVE A MEAL

04:06.377 --> 04:08.779
WITH A GROWN-UP,
GIVE ME A CALL.

04:08.779 --> 04:10.921
AND, UH, I'M AS OLD AS 2
20-YEAR-OLDS,

04:10.921 --> 04:14.254
SO MAYBE IT'LL FEEL
LIKE A MГ©NAGE Г  TROIS.

04:14.254 --> 04:17.027
(whispers) FRENCH.
THANKS FOR THE HERPES.

04:17.027 --> 04:18.389
(chuckles)

04:18.389 --> 04:20.431
IT'S AN INSIDE JOKE.

04:20.431 --> 04:22.793
OH, IT SOUNDS HILARIOUS.

04:22.793 --> 04:24.735
(slurps)

04:24.735 --> 04:28.869
HONEY, I TOLD YOU NOT TO TALK ON
YOUR CELL WHILE YOU'RE DRIVING.

04:28.869 --> 04:32.643
LAURIE, I ALMOST DIED.
WHERE'S MY WINE?

04:32.643 --> 04:36.747
ALL THE GLASSES
ARE IN THE DISHWASHER.
WELL, USE THAT SQUEEZY BOTTLE
THAT I TAKE TO SPIN CLASS.

04:36.747 --> 04:39.910
(sighs) I AM
SO NOT READY TO DIE.

04:39.910 --> 04:42.813
HERE'S YOUR MEDICINE.
WHAT ABOUT MY FUNERAL?

04:42.813 --> 04:45.316
DO YOU GUYS EVEN KNOW
WHAT SONG I WANT TO BE PLAYED

04:45.316 --> 04:48.559
WHEN I'M BEING LOWERED
IN THE CASKET?
(both)
GEORGE MICHAEL'S "FAITH."

04:48.559 --> 04:52.292
THAT'S A LUCKY GUESS. LAURIE,
DO YOU REMEMBER YOUR SPEECH?

04:52.292 --> 04:54.925
"SHE WAS MORE THAN MY
BEST FRIEND. SHE WAS MY LIFE."

04:54.925 --> 04:57.297
AND THEN I SINK TO MY KNEES,
AND I SCREAM.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.670
ALL RIGHT. IF IT FEELS RIGHT,
YOU CAN THROW UP.

04:59.670 --> 05:02.302
DONE.
YEAH, SURE, SURE.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.975
TRAVIS, HONEY, COME HERE.

05:04.975 --> 05:08.709
IF I DIE,
I NEED TO KNOW THAT...

05:08.709 --> 05:11.342
YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE
TO MOVE ON.

05:11.342 --> 05:13.444
HOW ABOUT I GRIEVE
FOR A FEW MONTHS,

05:13.444 --> 05:15.986
BUT THEN I LOOK FOR YOU
IN EVERY GIRL I DATE?
DEAL.

05:15.986 --> 05:17.448
(laughs)
(snorts, laughs)

05:17.448 --> 05:19.450
WHAT? THIS IS NOT FUNNY.
WHEN I'M GONE,

05:19.450 --> 05:21.852
WHO'S GONNA HELP YOU
NOT BECOME TOO CLOSED OFF?

05:21.852 --> 05:24.495
HMM? AND, LAURIE,
WHO'S GONNA MAKE SURE

05:24.495 --> 05:26.797
THAT YOU BELIEVE IN YOURSELF?
WELL...

05:26.797 --> 05:28.999
YOU KNOW, MOST PEOPLE, WHEN THEY
HAVE A NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE,

05:28.999 --> 05:31.802
THEY TAKE A HARD LOOK
AT THEIR OWN LIVES.

05:31.802 --> 05:34.365
WELL, I DON'T HAVE
ANY REALLY OBVIOUS VICES.

05:34.365 --> 05:36.867
(slurps)

05:36.867 --> 05:38.008
WHAT?

05:38.008 --> 05:41.472
OH, MAN, THAT IS GOOD.

05:41.472 --> 05:47.448
в™Єв™Є

05:53.654 --> 05:55.926
I NEED TO TAKE A LOOK
AT MY OWN LIFE.

05:55.926 --> 05:58.929
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT I SPEND
AS MUCH MONEY ON WINE

05:58.929 --> 06:01.091
AS I DO FOOD?
I WAS SURPRISED, TOO.

06:01.091 --> 06:03.734
I'M GONNA HAVE TO CUT BACK
ON THE VINO,

06:03.734 --> 06:05.736
YEAH, CHANGE THINGS UP A BIT.

06:05.736 --> 06:08.098
JULES, AT OUR AGE,
WE ARE WHO WE ARE.

06:08.098 --> 06:11.502
THERE'S NO MORE CHANGING.
WELL, IF THAT'S TRUE,
THEN HOW AM I GONNA HAVE

06:11.502 --> 06:14.374
MY ANTIQUES STORE IN PARIS?
WELL, THAT'S EASY. YOU'RE NOT.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.006
WELL, YOU JUST LOST
YOUR DISCOUNT.
OHH.

06:16.006 --> 06:19.580
I'M STILL YOUNG ENOUGH
TO TOTALLY CHANGE WHO I AM.
WE CAN ONLY HOPE.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.582
HEY, COME ON.
I CAN STILL CHANGE.

06:21.582 --> 06:25.986
THAT IS WHY I'VE DECIDED TO STOP
DRINKING WINE FOR ONE MONTH.
HA!

06:25.986 --> 06:28.719
BYE.
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

06:28.719 --> 06:31.091
YOU ONLY HAVE, LIKE,
TWO GLASSES OF WINE A NIGHT.

06:31.091 --> 06:32.823
(laughs, snorts)

06:32.823 --> 06:37.067
I JUST CAME BACK FOR THAT.
BYE AGAIN.

06:37.067 --> 06:39.169
HE EATS BANANAS FAST.

06:39.169 --> 06:41.502
WELL, STILL, I'VE DECIDED
TO STOP DRINKING WINE

06:41.502 --> 06:44.775
FOR ONE MONTH,
AND IT'S GONNA START RIGHT NOW.

06:44.775 --> 06:47.037
THEN IT'S GOOD-BYE
FOR A WHILE.

06:47.037 --> 06:49.139
BUT I LOVE WINE, JULES.

06:49.139 --> 06:52.913
WINE IS PART OF SOME
OF OUR BEST MEMORIES.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.715
TO MONDAY!

06:54.715 --> 06:57.187
(all) TO MONDAY!
(clink)

06:57.187 --> 07:00.150
OH, THAT WAS A GOOD MONDAY.
(chuckles)

07:00.150 --> 07:02.152
BUT STILL,
THERE ARE PLENTY OF TIMES

07:02.152 --> 07:04.124
THAT WE HAVE FUN
WITHOUT DRINKING.

07:07.157 --> 07:09.159
WAIT. AM I THE BLUE TRAIN?

07:09.159 --> 07:11.061
OH, WHO CARES? JUST ROLL.
(door opens)

07:11.061 --> 07:12.603
(scoffs)
(door closes)

07:12.603 --> 07:13.934
I GOT WINE!

07:13.934 --> 07:17.107
(all cheer)

07:17.107 --> 07:20.110
OH, RIGHT. WE GOT WINE.

07:21.572 --> 07:23.714
SO YOU'RE DIVORCED.

07:23.714 --> 07:25.716
HOW'D YOUR MARRIAGE
FALL APART?

07:25.716 --> 07:28.749
WOW. THAT IS KIND OF AN AFTER-
I-PUT-MY-NAPKIN-IN-MY-LAP

07:28.749 --> 07:30.581
KIND OF QUESTION.

07:30.581 --> 07:33.123
FINE. WHY DON'T YOU EASE US IN
WITH SOME OF THAT BANTER

07:33.123 --> 07:36.587
YOU USE ON THE YOUNG GALS?
WELL, USUALLY WE'LL START
WITH MIDDLE NAMES,

07:36.587 --> 07:38.589
AND THEN WE GO
TO FAVORITE NUMBERS,

07:38.589 --> 07:40.591
AND THEN IF THINGS
ARE GOING REALLY WELL,

07:40.591 --> 07:42.593
THEN WE'LL GO
TO KITTENS VERSUS PUPPIES.

07:42.593 --> 07:46.497
I LIKE PUPPIES MORE 'CAUSE
IT TICKLES WHEN THEY LICK YOU.
LET'S JUST DO THIS.

07:46.497 --> 07:49.600
NOW... ARE YOU CLOSE
WITH YOUR FOLKS?
NOT A GREAT AREA.

07:49.600 --> 07:52.873
OKAY. DO YOU SEE YOURSELF
GETTING MARRIED AGAIN?

07:52.873 --> 07:54.905
ALSO A TROUBLE ZONE.

07:54.905 --> 07:56.907
ONE TIME I WAS TREKKING
THROUGH NEPAL,

07:56.907 --> 07:59.910
AND I HAD TO ACT OUT
"WHERE CAN I GET A TAMPON?"

07:59.910 --> 08:01.211
TO A MONK.

08:01.211 --> 08:03.654
THIS CONVERSATION--
HARDER THAN THAT.

08:03.654 --> 08:06.857
OH, COME ON. LET...
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE, UM...

08:06.857 --> 08:09.119
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE NUMBER?
THREE.

08:09.119 --> 08:11.662
THREE. (chuckles)
THREE'S PRETTY COOL.

08:11.662 --> 08:13.594
OH... MY GOD.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.826
MINE'S FIVE.

08:15.826 --> 08:17.968
WHAT THE HELL?

08:17.968 --> 08:19.830
YOU'RE--
YOU'RE 20 MINUTES LATE.

08:19.830 --> 08:23.003
IS THAT MY CO-CAPTAIN'S HAT?
HE LIKES TO WEAR IT.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.676
HEY, SO I'M LATE.
TRAVIS NEEDED A WALK.

08:25.676 --> 08:27.137
COME ON.

08:27.137 --> 08:30.841
(growls)
HIS BRAIN LOVES PANCAKES,
BUT HIS TUMMY DOES NOT.

08:30.841 --> 08:34.114
YOU'VE BEEN SPENDING
ALL YOUR TIME WITH HIM.
WATCH OUT, BUDDY.

08:34.114 --> 08:36.587
ELEVATOR, TRAV.
GOOD BOY.

08:36.587 --> 08:38.589
DID YOU MAKE THIS FOR HIM?
(gate creaks closed)

08:38.589 --> 08:41.051
YEAH. YOU KNOW,
THE BOAT'S TOUGH ON TRAVIS.

08:41.051 --> 08:44.094
YOU KNOW, MY BED'S TOO SMALL
FOR HIM TO LIE ACROSS MY FEET.

08:44.094 --> 08:47.227
SO, YOU KNOW,
WE SLEEP FACE-TO-FACE.
I BET HIS NOSE
IS COLD AND GROSS.

08:47.227 --> 08:50.030
YEAH, IT IS AT FIRST,
BUT YOU KNOW,

08:50.030 --> 08:52.532
MY NOSE WARMS HIS UP.
(creaks)

08:58.639 --> 09:00.170
в™Єв™Є

09:00.170 --> 09:03.714
WELL, ARE YOU JUST GONNA
SIT THERE AND TORTURE ME

09:03.714 --> 09:06.176
BY DRINKING WINE?
WE'RE IN A BAR.

09:06.176 --> 09:08.749
JUST LET ME SMELL IT.

09:08.749 --> 09:11.281
(sniffs) WHAT IS THAT?
SYPHILIS.

09:11.281 --> 09:13.884
HERPES.
HERPES.

09:13.884 --> 09:16.086
MMM. HAVE A SIP.
OKAY, STOP IT.

09:16.086 --> 09:19.660
I'M GONNA DO THIS. GRAYSON,
YOU BELIEVE IN ME, DON'T YOU?

09:19.660 --> 09:22.562
WHAT IS IT WITH WOMEN YOUR AGE
NEEDING TO KNOW HOW I FEEL?

09:22.562 --> 09:25.966
OH, NO. DID SOMEONE NOT
HAVE FUN ON HIS BIG BOY DATE?

09:25.966 --> 09:28.799
"WHAT HAPPENED IN YOUR MARRIAGE?
ARE YOUR PARENTS NICE?

09:28.799 --> 09:31.241
WHAT ARE YOUR HOPES AND DREAMS?"
I MEAN, WHO CARES?

09:31.241 --> 09:35.145
WHY CAN'T WE JUST TALK
HOW REAL PEOPLE TALK?
THAT IS HOW REAL PEOPLE TALK.

09:35.145 --> 09:37.077
ZINGER! COME HERE, YOU.
ALL RIGHT.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.348
(both, singsongy) BING!

09:38.348 --> 09:40.010
NO. NO "BING."

09:40.010 --> 09:42.212
OH, YES, "BING."

09:42.212 --> 09:45.916
OH, TOM.
LOOK, I JUST PREFER
YOUNGER WOMEN.

09:45.916 --> 09:48.588
THEY'RE SIMPLER.
THEIR HAIR SMELLS LIKE FRUIT.

09:48.588 --> 09:52.623
THEY'RE JUST MORE FUN.
ARE THEY STILL MORE FUN
AFTER THE SEX IS OVER?

09:52.623 --> 09:54.995
UH, THAT'S WHEN
THEY ARE THE MOST FUN.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.727
SO PATHETIC.
YEAH.

09:56.727 --> 09:59.830
THAT'S WORTH A BING?

09:59.830 --> 10:03.033
HEY! TRAV,
YOUR HAIR LOOKS GOOD.

10:03.033 --> 10:06.306
THANKS. I'M KIND OF
TRYING A NEW LOOK.

10:06.306 --> 10:09.009
NOT YOU, TRAV. YOU, TRAV.

10:09.009 --> 10:11.942
THIS IS GONNA BE
YEARS OF FUN.

10:11.942 --> 10:13.944
I'M GONNA GO GET A CAMERA

10:13.944 --> 10:16.616
AND TAKE A PICTURE
OF MY SUPERMODEL. YEAH, BUDDY!

10:18.689 --> 10:21.852
SO... YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD
JUST WALTZ ON IN HERE

10:21.852 --> 10:25.896
AND STEAL HIM AWAY FROM ME
WITH THAT CUTE HOUND DOG FACE?

10:25.896 --> 10:27.898
WELL, GUESS WHAT, PALLY?

10:27.898 --> 10:29.860
I CAN MAKE THAT FACE, TOO.
OOH!

10:29.860 --> 10:32.803
(barks)
BOBBY, HE'S GO--
YO, HE'S GONNA KILL ME!

10:32.803 --> 10:35.365
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?

10:35.365 --> 10:39.139
YOU'RE JUST A BIG OLD SWEETIE,
AREN'T YOU, BUDDY?

10:39.139 --> 10:41.141
DON'T BE ACTING WEIRD,
ANDY.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.175
(barks, growls)

10:45.175 --> 10:47.778
OH, YOU'RE GOOD.

10:47.778 --> 10:51.281
OH, MY GOD.
THAT WAS, LIKE, SO HOT.

10:51.281 --> 10:54.284
HEY, I KNOW EARLIER I SAID
FOUR WAS MY FAVORITE NUMBER,

10:54.284 --> 10:55.986
BUT IT'S REALLY SIX.

10:55.986 --> 10:58.989
I WAS JUST SCARED
YOU'D THINK I WAS A DORK.

10:58.989 --> 11:01.892
(giggles) SO WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO DO NOW?

11:01.892 --> 11:05.736
SOMETIMES BEING QUIET
IS FUN.

11:09.299 --> 11:12.042
(slowly) DIAL LAURIE.

11:12.042 --> 11:14.274
(rings)

11:14.274 --> 11:15.345
(ring)
(snoring)

11:15.345 --> 11:16.807
HELLO?

11:16.807 --> 11:18.378
Bobby? Stupid phone.

11:18.378 --> 11:20.751
HEY, I'M SORRY
TO CALL YOU SO EARLY.

11:20.751 --> 11:22.753
IT'S JUST THAT I-I'VE,
YOU KNOW, STOPPED DRINKING,

11:22.753 --> 11:25.085
SO... (chuckles)
I JUST HAVE ALL THIS ENERGY.

11:25.085 --> 11:27.087
I MEAN, IT'S 6:00,
AND I'M UP.

11:27.087 --> 11:29.389
IT'S LIKE I'M A FARMER.
OH, WHAT'S THAT NOISE?

11:29.389 --> 11:32.192
DO YOU HAVE A GIRL THERE?

11:35.826 --> 11:38.268
WITHOUT WINE,
I JUST FEEL BETTER.

11:38.268 --> 11:40.801
I-I SLEEP BETTER.
I EVEN REMEMBER MY DREAMS.

11:40.801 --> 11:43.403
YOU KNOW, IN ONE,
I WAS MY OWN SIAMESE TWIN.

11:43.403 --> 11:45.405
I HAD THIS TINY, LITTLE
RIGHT SIDE.

11:45.405 --> 11:47.878
MY LEFT SIDE
HAD TO PUSH HER AROUND

11:47.878 --> 11:49.880
IN A LITTLE CART WITH WHEELS.

11:49.880 --> 11:53.183
WE HAD THIS GREAT FIANCГ©
NAMED JASON.
DOES THIS STORY
GO ON MUCH LONGER?

11:53.183 --> 11:55.215
OH, JUST UNTIL
MY TINY HALF MURDERS HIM.

11:55.215 --> 11:59.990
BUT IN HIS DEFENSE, I WILL SAY
SHE WAS REALLY BUGGY. WOW.

12:06.456 --> 12:08.228
I'M PAINTING YOUR MAILBOX.

12:12.432 --> 12:14.805
(man) NI HAO MA?
NI HAO MA?

12:14.805 --> 12:16.937
NI HAO MA?
NI HAO MA?

12:16.937 --> 12:19.309
SERIOUSLY, JULES? MANDARIN?

12:19.309 --> 12:21.311
NI HAO MA?
NI HAO MA?

12:21.311 --> 12:22.843
NI HAO...

12:24.214 --> 12:27.417
(telephone rings)

12:27.417 --> 12:30.280
(ring)

12:30.280 --> 12:32.052
(beep)

12:32.052 --> 12:33.423
Hey, Ellie.

12:33.423 --> 12:36.186
WHERE ARE YOU GUYS?
NO ONE'S ANSWERING THEIR PHONES,

12:36.186 --> 12:38.358
AND OUR FAVORITE SHOW'S
ABOUT TO START.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.360
ALL RIGHT.
I KNOW THIS SOUNDS CRAZY,

12:40.360 --> 12:43.293
BUT SEEMS LIKE
EVERYONE'S DODGING ME.

12:43.293 --> 12:44.764
(beep)

12:44.764 --> 12:45.896
(sighs)

12:45.896 --> 12:48.268
(speaks Mandarin)

12:56.176 --> 12:58.348
OH, THERE YOU ARE.

12:58.348 --> 13:00.410
THE SHOW'S OVER,
BUT I DVR'd IT.

13:00.410 --> 13:02.212
AND NO SPOILERS,

13:02.212 --> 13:05.856
BUT THE DEAD BROTHER GUY
SANG "CAT'S IN THE CRADLE."

13:05.856 --> 13:08.418
(singsongy) TEAR FEST.
JULES...

13:08.418 --> 13:11.421
(normal voice) OH, THERE'S
NO WINE, BUT I DID BUY EVERYBODY

13:11.421 --> 13:13.864
THESE LITTLE ENVIRONMENTALLY
FRIENDLY WATER BOTTLES.

13:13.864 --> 13:17.297
OH.
(all muttering indistinctly)

13:17.297 --> 13:20.130
THEY EVEN HAVE CLIPS SO THAT
YOU CAN PUT 'EM ON YOUR BELT.

13:20.130 --> 13:23.203
OKAY. I GUESS
I'M JUST GONNA HAVE TO START.
START WHAT?

13:23.203 --> 13:27.107
"JULES, YOUR FRIENDS ARE HERE
BECAUSE THE CHOICES YOU'VE MADE

13:27.107 --> 13:29.139
ARE HURTING THE PEOPLE
THAT YOU LOVE."

13:29.139 --> 13:30.410
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

13:30.410 --> 13:33.043
THIS IS AN INTERVENTION,
SWEETIE.

13:33.043 --> 13:34.444
MOM...

13:34.444 --> 13:36.516
YOU NEED TO START
DRINKING AGAIN.

13:36.516 --> 13:38.318
SERIOUSLY?

13:38.318 --> 13:41.291
NOTHING COULD EVER MAKE ME
STOP LOVING YOU

13:41.291 --> 13:43.323
EXCEPT YOU NOT DRINKING.

13:43.323 --> 13:46.526
12 STEPS, SHMELVE STEPS.
ALCOHOL MAKES PEOPLE FUN.

13:46.526 --> 13:49.399
I WROTE A FEW THINGS DOWN.

13:52.362 --> 13:55.435
"THIS IS SILLY."

13:55.435 --> 14:00.140
THAT'S ALL I WROTE,
'CAUSE I THINK THIS IS SILLY.

14:00.140 --> 14:01.972
NO. I WILL NOT DRINK.

14:01.972 --> 14:04.474
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GUYS,

14:04.474 --> 14:07.317
ESPECIALLY YOU TWO.
I SUPPORT BOTH OF YOU

14:07.317 --> 14:09.279
WITH EVERYTHING YOU DO,

14:09.279 --> 14:12.522
AND IF YOU DO SOMETHING STUPID,
I DON'T RUB YOUR NOSES IN IT.

14:12.522 --> 14:15.485
I MEAN, I-I MAY TELL STRANGERS
AT THE GROCERY STORE.

14:15.485 --> 14:18.188
BUT IF THEY LAUGH AT YOU,
I SAY, "NO, NO, NO.

14:18.188 --> 14:20.190
YOU CAN'T LAUGH
AT MY FRIENDS."

14:20.190 --> 14:22.132
BECAUSE THAT'S THE KIND
OF PERSON THAT I AM.

14:22.132 --> 14:25.035
(Spanish accent)
BITCHES BE LOCO.
ES VERDAD.

14:25.035 --> 14:27.267
(Andy chuckles)
IF NO ONE HAS
ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY,

14:27.267 --> 14:29.269
I'D LIKE YOU ALL TO LEAVE.

14:29.269 --> 14:32.542
HEY. HEY! IF YOU GUYS AREN'T
TAKING THESE, CAN I HAVE 'EM?

14:32.542 --> 14:34.444
THEY'RE GREAT!

14:34.444 --> 14:36.306
(clanking)

14:36.306 --> 14:37.647
(laughs)

14:37.647 --> 14:41.181
COME ON.
JUST WALK HIM FOR ME.

14:41.181 --> 14:42.882
OF COURSE THAT'S WHY
YOU CALLED ME.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.485
(singsongy) CAREFUL, ARod.
DOGS SMELL JEALOUSY.

14:45.485 --> 14:47.357
NO, THEY SMELL FEAR.

14:47.357 --> 14:49.920
THEN WHAT AM I THINKING OF?
BEES?

14:49.920 --> 14:52.492
(growls)
NO, BEES SMELL JOY.
THAT'S WHY THEY RUIN PICNICS.

14:52.492 --> 14:55.625
NOW I NEED MY TWO BEST FRIENDS
TO GET ALONG.

14:55.625 --> 14:58.528
I DON'T WANT Y'ALL COMING BACK
UNTIL YOU MAKE PEACE.

14:58.528 --> 15:00.270
(barking)
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

15:00.270 --> 15:03.403
YOU KNOW HOW IF YOU EAT TOO MUCH
OF A CERTAIN TYPE OF CANDY,

15:03.403 --> 15:05.405
YOU NEVER WANT IT AGAIN?

15:05.405 --> 15:07.978
WELL, THAT'S HOW I FEEL
ABOUT YOUNG GIRLS.

15:07.978 --> 15:09.909
(thump)

15:09.909 --> 15:11.911
IS THAT THE SIGNAL
YOU DECIDED ON

15:11.911 --> 15:14.614
FOR WHEN YOU'RE
NOT FOLLOWING ME?
IT WAS.

15:14.614 --> 15:17.087
I AM SICK
OF YOUNG, SILLY GIRLS.

15:17.087 --> 15:19.419
I LIKE OLDER GALS, YOU KNOW?
IT'S JUST EASIER.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.391
YOU GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER,
HAVE SEX,

15:21.391 --> 15:24.294
DECIDE WHO APOLOGIZES TO WHO,
AND THEN... (whistles)

15:24.294 --> 15:27.257
ON YOUR WAY.
YEAH, BUT WOMEN OUR AGE JUST
WANT TO MESS WITH YOUR HEAD.

15:27.257 --> 15:29.299
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE THEY KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT TO SAY

15:29.299 --> 15:32.102
TO FREAK YOU OUT.
COMMITMENT!

15:32.102 --> 15:34.404
AAH!

15:36.606 --> 15:38.538
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

15:38.538 --> 15:41.111
HONEY, YOU WERE RIGHT.

15:41.111 --> 15:43.113
BUT, YOU KNOW,
AS YOUR BEST FRIENDS,

15:43.113 --> 15:45.115
WE SHOULD HAVE JUST
BEEN THERE FOR YOU,

15:45.115 --> 15:47.477
I MEAN, REGARDLESS OF WHICH ONE
OF US IS YOUR BEST, BEST FRIEND.

15:47.477 --> 15:49.319
(whispers) OBVIOUSLY ME.

15:49.319 --> 15:51.581
(normal voice) ANYWAY...

15:51.581 --> 15:53.383
(singsongy) I'M SORRY.

15:53.383 --> 15:56.556
I'M SORRY, JULES.
I JUST WANTED TO WIN SO BAD.

15:56.556 --> 16:00.160
WELL, I HOPE YOU TWO LEARNED
SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS--

16:00.160 --> 16:03.663
WAIT. IS YOUR TONGUE PURPLE?
STICK IT OUT!
(mumbles) I THINK YOU TWO
SHOULD LEAVE NOW.

16:03.663 --> 16:06.296
HER LIPS ARE PURPLE, TOO!
SHE'S BEEN DRINKING WINE!

16:06.296 --> 16:08.368
J'ACCUSE!

16:08.368 --> 16:10.470
WHAT IS THIS--"C.S.I."?
(guitar chord strums)

16:10.470 --> 16:13.343
SO HE WOULDN'T EVEN TELL YOU
IF HE LIKES HIS PARENTS?

16:13.343 --> 16:16.306
PLUS TO BE COOL,
HE CALLED THE WAITER "BRO."

16:16.306 --> 16:19.409
THAT'S WEAK, DUDE.
DUDE'S STILL OKAY, RIGHT?

16:19.409 --> 16:22.352
OH, DUDE'S TIMELESS.
OH, THIS IS SO MUCH FUN.
(chuckles)

16:22.352 --> 16:27.017
LOOK, SARA, I'M REALLY SORRY
THAT OUR DATE MADE YOU SO ANGRY.

16:27.017 --> 16:29.519
I WASN'T ANGRY. I WAS
JUST DISAPPOINTED, YOU KNOW,

16:29.519 --> 16:32.462
WITH HOW BORING YOU WERE.
ARE YOU CALLING ME BORING?

16:32.462 --> 16:34.724
NOT REALLY
A HIDDEN MESSAGE, DUDE.

16:34.724 --> 16:37.697
DON'T YOU HAVE TO GET
BACK TO YOUR HORSE DOG?
HE'S ON A PLAYDATE.

16:37.697 --> 16:40.630
BOBBY!
STOP THIS CRAZY THING!

16:40.630 --> 16:44.134
(barking)
WHOA, WHOA! TRAVIS! TRAVIS!

16:44.134 --> 16:46.136
LOOK, HONEY,
LIFE IS JUST TOO SHORT.

16:46.136 --> 16:48.138
AND IF YOU CAN'T BE REAL
WITH SOMEONE,

16:48.138 --> 16:50.480
THEN YOU'RE JUST
NOT THAT INTERESTING.

16:50.480 --> 16:53.043
I MEAN, NOT TO ME, ANYWAY.

16:53.043 --> 16:54.444
в™Єв™Є

16:54.444 --> 16:56.516
ME, NEITHER.

16:56.516 --> 17:00.190
SORRY. I JUST GOT CAUGHT UP
IN IT. SHE'S A FOX!

17:01.751 --> 17:03.753
YOU KNOW WHAT'S WEIRD?

17:03.753 --> 17:07.357
AFTER ALL THAT, I-I DON'T
EVEN WANT THIS ANYMORE.
REALLY?

17:07.357 --> 17:09.329
(slurps)

17:09.329 --> 17:11.431
MMM. NO.

17:11.431 --> 17:15.505
IT'S LIKE FINDING MY
MISSING CHILD, BUT IN A GLASS.

17:15.505 --> 17:17.467
CONGRATULATIONS, ELLIE.
YOU WERE RIGHT.

17:17.467 --> 17:20.340
I CAN'T CHANGE. I CAN'T,
NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT.

17:20.340 --> 17:22.772
OH,
THIS STUFF IS DELICIOUS,

17:22.772 --> 17:24.814
BUT MAN,
IT JUST TASTES SO EMPTY.

17:24.814 --> 17:27.747
JULES, REEL IT IN. DON'T GET
ALL WEIRD AND POIGNANT.

17:27.747 --> 17:30.520
CHERISH THE YEARS, LAURIE.

17:30.520 --> 17:32.652
AND WE'RE OFF.
OH, BOY.

17:32.652 --> 17:34.654
I MEAN, YOU'RE STILL YOUNG.

17:34.654 --> 17:37.187
YOU'VE GOT BIG CHANGES
AROUND EVERY SINGLE CORNER.

17:37.187 --> 17:40.490
I MEAN, YOU CAN STILL DREAM
ABOUT BEING A-A PAINTER

17:40.490 --> 17:43.093
OR A PASTRY CHEF
OR AN ANTIQUES STORE OWNER

17:43.093 --> 17:45.695
IN PARIS WHO SELLS
SUCH BEAUTIFUL OLD CLOCKS

17:45.695 --> 17:48.468
THAT THEY PUT HER PICTURE
ON THE COVER OF MAGAZINES.

17:48.468 --> 17:51.671
I DON'T THINK THEY PUT
YOUR PICTURE ON MAGAZINES

17:51.671 --> 17:54.674
FOR SELLING CLOCKS.
UGH. YOU KNOW WHAT SUCKS
ABOUT GETTING OLDER?

17:54.674 --> 17:57.347
IS THAT YOU STILL HAVE
ALL THE SAME DREAMS

17:57.347 --> 17:59.349
THAT THINGS ARE
GONNA BE DIFFERENT,

17:59.349 --> 18:01.351
YOU KNOW, IN A YEAR,
10 YEARS, 20, WHATEVER.

18:01.351 --> 18:04.154
BUT DEEP DOWN INSIDE,
YOU KNOW THOSE DREAMS

18:04.154 --> 18:05.785
AREN'T GONNA COME TRUE.

18:05.785 --> 18:08.488
YOU KNOW, I JUST GET OUT
OF BED EVERY DAY,

18:08.488 --> 18:10.790
AND I SAY, OH,
THIS IS IT, YOU KNOW?

18:10.790 --> 18:13.823
I AM WHO I AM.
AND THEN I'LL DIE.

18:13.823 --> 18:15.225
OH.

18:15.225 --> 18:17.227
MAYBE YOU ARE DONE CHANGING.

18:17.227 --> 18:19.229
BUT THAT'S MAYBE
A GOOD THING,

18:19.229 --> 18:22.172
'CAUSE YOU'RE ALREADY
SUCH AN AMAZING PERSON

18:22.172 --> 18:24.574
AND A GREAT FRIEND
AND AN INCREDIBLE MOTHER.

18:24.574 --> 18:26.576
(Miike Snow)
в™Є ...WITH SOMETHING в™Є

18:26.576 --> 18:28.708
NOPE, DIDN'T HELP.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.580
OKAY. CHEERS.

18:30.580 --> 18:32.212
(grunting)

18:32.212 --> 18:33.583
(growling)

18:33.583 --> 18:35.615
OHH!

18:35.615 --> 18:38.148
I WANT TO GO HOME!

18:38.148 --> 18:39.549
(growling)

18:39.549 --> 18:42.222
в™Є AM I FREE OR AM I TIED UP? в™Є

18:42.222 --> 18:44.424
(grunts) YOU KNOW WHAT?
ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH.

18:44.424 --> 18:46.356
I DON'T LIKE YOU.

18:46.356 --> 18:48.758
YOU DON'T LIKE ME.
YOU WANT TO HAVE IT OUT?

18:48.758 --> 18:51.301
LET'S HAVE IT OUT
RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW.

18:51.301 --> 18:53.433
COME ON.
WHAT ARE YOU, CHICKEN?

18:53.433 --> 18:54.504
COME ON. LET'S DO IT.

18:54.504 --> 18:56.706
(imitates punching sounds)
OOH!

18:56.706 --> 18:58.408
IN YOUR FACE!

18:58.408 --> 18:59.909
(barking)

18:59.909 --> 19:01.211
WHOA!

19:01.211 --> 19:03.373
(Grayson)
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

19:03.373 --> 19:06.376
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
LOOK, UH, JUST FOR THE RECORD,

19:06.376 --> 19:10.550
I DID NOT CALL THAT WAITER
"BRO." I CALLED HIM JOE.

19:10.550 --> 19:13.223
THAT'S HIS NAME.
REALLY?

19:13.223 --> 19:15.585
NO, IT'S DONNY, BUT "BRO" IS
STILL COOL, AND YOU KNOW IT.

19:15.585 --> 19:18.458
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
YOU WANT REAL?

19:18.458 --> 19:20.790
YOU'RE AN ANNOYING WOMAN.

19:20.790 --> 19:24.394
YEAH. WE SAT FOR TWO SECONDS
BEFORE YOU STARTED PEPPERING ME

19:24.394 --> 19:26.696
WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT
WHAT I WANT FROM LIFE.

19:26.696 --> 19:29.469
LOOK, JUST LET ME HAVE
A PIECE OF BREAD,

19:29.469 --> 19:32.872
AND THEN I'LL TELL YOU IF YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE MY BABY, OKAY?

19:32.872 --> 19:35.575
LOOK, I WAS MARRIED
TO A WOMAN WHO BETRAYED ME

19:35.575 --> 19:37.777
SO COMPLETELY THAT I ALMOST
LOST ALL CAPACITY TO CARE

19:37.777 --> 19:40.680
ABOUT ANYTHING OR ANYONE,
BUT I'M SUPPOSED TO TRUST YOU

19:40.680 --> 19:43.453
BECAUSE YOU SMILED AT ME
OVER A GLASS OF WINE?

19:43.453 --> 19:45.515
MNH-MNH-MNH.
GIVE ME A BREAK.

19:45.515 --> 19:48.388
в™Є I'M STILL AN ANIMAL в™Є

19:48.388 --> 19:50.790
в™Є I CHANGE SHAPES
JUST TO HIDE IN THIS PLACE в™Є

19:50.790 --> 19:52.892
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

19:52.892 --> 19:54.494
YOU GOT INTERESTING.

19:54.494 --> 19:56.826
в™Є I'M STILL AN ANIMAL в™Є

19:56.826 --> 19:59.929
(Andy) HELP ME! OH, GOD!
DID YOU JUST HEAR SOMETHING?

19:59.929 --> 20:03.803
PLEASE, SOMEBODY, GET HIM
OFF MY HEAD! GET OFF ME!

20:03.803 --> 20:06.506
в™Єв™Є

20:06.506 --> 20:08.878
ARE YOU EVER GONNA
STOP MOPING?

20:08.878 --> 20:11.241
(cell phone rings)

20:11.241 --> 20:13.243
(ring)

20:13.243 --> 20:15.315
(ring)
WHAT? WHAT ARE WE STOPPING?

20:15.315 --> 20:17.317
(gasps) ARE YOU GONNA
KILL YOURSELF

20:17.317 --> 20:19.319
ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD?

20:19.319 --> 20:21.721
DON'T BE SELFISH.
DO IT AT HOME.

20:21.721 --> 20:24.354
IT'S A CALL FROM A CLIENT.
SEE, AFTER THE ACCIDENT,

20:24.354 --> 20:27.697
I DON'T TALK ON THE PHONE
ANYMORE WHEN I DRIVE,

20:27.697 --> 20:29.699
BECAUSE IT'S TOO DAN--
OH, MY GOD.

20:29.699 --> 20:31.701
ELLIE, I'VE BEEN
DOING THIS FOR YEARS,

20:31.701 --> 20:35.565
AND I JUST STOPPED. BITE ME!
I CAN STILL CHANGE!

20:35.565 --> 20:37.737
I JUST ALMOST
HAD TO DIE FIRST.

20:37.737 --> 20:40.740
HEY, I BET IF I ALMOST DIED
FROM DRINKING WINE,

20:40.740 --> 20:44.243
I COULD STOP DOING THAT, TOO.
I'M NOT SURE
THAT'S A GREAT POINT.

20:44.243 --> 20:47.547
в™Є NOBODY KNOWS IT BUT ME
WHEN I SLIP в™Є

20:47.547 --> 20:49.749
I WIN, WORLD!

20:49.749 --> 20:53.823
I'M GONNA HAVE AN ANTIQUES SHOP
IN PARIS! THAT'S RIGHT.

20:53.823 --> 20:55.985
I'M GONNA BE
ON THE COVER OF MAGAZINES!

20:55.985 --> 20:58.688
(honks horn)
AAH!

20:58.688 --> 21:00.390
THAT IS NOT COOL!

21:08.438 --> 21:10.370
YOU GUYS SWEAR YOU'RE OKAY?

21:10.370 --> 21:12.502
WE GOT IT ALL OUT.

21:12.502 --> 21:14.604
THEN SHAKE ON IT.

21:14.604 --> 21:16.906
NO.
(singsongy) DON'T LEAVE HIM
HANGING, ANDY.

21:16.906 --> 21:19.409
(barks, growls)

21:19.409 --> 21:21.351
THERE IT IS!

21:21.351 --> 21:23.953
FRIENDS FOREVER.

21:23.953 --> 21:25.955
(lowers voice)
THIS AIN'T OVER.

21:25.955 --> 21:28.558
(normal voice)
SEE YOU TOMORROW, BOBBY!
SEE YOU LATER!

21:33.493 --> 21:34.994
(groans)

21:34.994 --> 21:36.295
(barks)

21:36.295 --> 21:38.297
WELL PLAYED.
