I DON'T KNOW, MAN, I
THINK YOU'RE LOSING IT.

00:06.968 --> 00:08.634
THAT GIRL BARELY
KNEW YOU WERE THERE.

00:08.734 --> 00:10.467
WHAT ARE YOU EVEN
TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?

00:10.567 --> 00:11.968
SHE HAD HER EYES
ALL OVER ME.

00:12.067 --> 00:14.300
OH, DOES THAT EXPLAIN THAT
WARM RECEPTION YOU GOT

00:14.400 --> 00:15.834
WHEN YOU ASKED FOR
HER NUMBER, HUH?

00:15.934 --> 00:17.934
I HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU
BUT IN SOME COUNTRIES,

00:18.033 --> 00:21.567
IT'S CONSIDERED AN ENGAGEMENT
WHEN YOU GET SLAPPED.
AH.

00:21.667 --> 00:22.968
WHERE'S...
WHERE'S SHALIMAR AND LEXA?

00:23.067 --> 00:25.100
I DON'T KNOW. GETTING RID
OF SOME DUDES?

00:25.200 --> 00:27.601
Biker:
WRONG PLACE, WRONG TIME.

00:27.701 --> 00:32.667
Biker:
LOOKS LIKE YOU BOYS
MADE A REAL BIG MISTAKE.

00:32.767 --> 00:35.567
OH YEAH?
HOW DO YOU FIGURE?

00:35.667 --> 00:39.701
Biker:
'CAUSE YOU'RE ABOUT TO
GET YOUR ASSES KICKED.

00:39.801 --> 00:41.801
GETTING OUR ASSES KICKED?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:41.901 --> 00:44.334
<laughs>
COULD BE FUN.

00:44.434 --> 00:45.868
Biker:
YOU'LL DIE LAUGHING.

00:45.968 --> 01:03.234
<fight sounds>

01:03.334 --> 01:05.901
LEAVE THEM ALONE
FOR TWO MINUTES...

THIS IS DR. ROBINSON.

02:58.934 --> 03:00.267
YEAH, HURRY UP.
HE'S IN THE LAB.

03:00.367 --> 03:01.501
HOW IS HE?

03:01.601 --> 03:02.767
HE'S NOT FEELING GOOD.
HE'S BARELY CONSCIOUS.

03:02.868 --> 03:04.434
THEY SAID HE WAS SHOT.
WAS HE MASSED OUT?

03:04.534 --> 03:05.601
YES.
WHAT?

03:05.701 --> 03:07.501
THE DOMINION SENT OVER
HIS MEDICAL FILES.

03:07.601 --> 03:08.501
THIS WAY?

03:08.601 --> 03:10.701
OH...
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY, JESS.

03:12.133 --> 03:14.300
UH...

03:14.400 --> 03:16.033
<coughs>

03:24.501 --> 03:25.801
WHAT'S GOING ON,
DOC?

03:25.901 --> 03:27.434
I'M NOT SURE.

03:27.534 --> 03:28.434
AGH...

03:28.534 --> 03:29.834
HOW IS THIS
EVEN POSSIBLE?

03:29.934 --> 03:32.234
I MEAN, HE WAS MASSED
OUT - HOW CAN HE BE SHOT?

03:32.334 --> 03:34.300
<coughing, screaming>

03:34.400 --> 03:36.234
HOLD HIM DOWN!

03:39.801 --> 03:41.801
COME ON, SHAL.
I WANT TO STAY.

03:41.901 --> 03:43.133
LOOK, THE BEST THING WE
CAN DO FOR JESS RIGHT NOW

03:43.234 --> 03:45.267
IS TO FIND OUT
WHO DID THIS.

03:45.367 --> 03:46.868
OKAY? COME ON.

03:46.968 --> 03:49.300
BE STRONG, JESSE.

03:49.400 --> 03:51.868
EASY, JESS. EASY.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.767
UH...

03:56.868 --> 03:58.133
YOU A TELEPATH?

03:58.234 --> 03:59.434
YES.

03:59.534 --> 04:01.400
SOMETIMES IN CASES
OF SEVERE TRAUMA,

04:01.501 --> 04:02.901
HEALING OF THE MIND
IS JUST AS IMPORTANT

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
AS THE HEALING
OF THE BODY.

04:06.601 --> 04:08.100
RIGHT THERE.

04:08.200 --> 04:10.200
WHAT'S INSIDE HIM IS
NOT JUST A BULLET.

04:10.300 --> 04:13.467
IT'S PACKED WITH
ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS.

04:16.399 --> 04:17.634
HEY, BUDDY.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

04:17.733 --> 04:19.132
WHAT HAPPENED?

04:19.233 --> 04:21.132
YOU TOOK A BULLET FOR ME.

04:21.233 --> 04:23.834
BUT I WAS MASSED.

04:23.934 --> 04:25.100
I KNOW.

04:25.200 --> 04:28.434
IT'S A SPECIAL KIND OF BULLET.

04:28.534 --> 04:30.067
IT HURTS, BRENNAN.

04:30.167 --> 04:31.767
I KNOW, BUDDY.

04:31.868 --> 04:33.834
LOOK, YOU JUST HANG
IN THERE, OKAY?

04:33.934 --> 04:36.567
YOU'RE IN GOOD HANDS.

04:37.434 --> 04:38.968
WHAT THE HELL IS IN HIM?

04:39.067 --> 04:41.734
I'M NOT SURE, BUT WHATEVER
IT IS I HAVE TO GET IT OUT.

04:41.834 --> 04:44.033
NOW I CAN'T USE ANESTHETIC
- HE'S TOO WEAK.

04:44.133 --> 04:46.200
IT'LL KILL HIM.

04:49.868 --> 04:53.400
Doctor:
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO
BE ALL RIGHT, JESSE.

04:54.400 --> 04:57.501
<ringing>

04:57.601 --> 04:58.667
HELLO?

04:58.767 --> 05:00.133
<i>Voice:
HOW'S JESSE?</i>

05:00.234 --> 05:01.667
WHO IS THIS?

05:01.767 --> 05:03.634
<i>Voice:
THE BULLET IN HIS BODY
CONTAINS ENOUGH EXPLOSIVE</i>

05:03.734 --> 05:05.701
<i>TO TAKE OUT HALF OF SANCTUARY.</i>

05:05.801 --> 05:07.801
I HAVE THE DETONATOR.

05:07.901 --> 05:09.534
<i>Lexa:
ANYTHING HAPPENS TO JESSE...</i>

05:09.634 --> 05:11.467
THAT'S ENTIRELY UP TO YOU.

05:11.567 --> 05:14.801
<i>I HAVE THE POWER
TO SAVE HIM.</i>

05:14.901 --> 05:16.334
IN EXCHANGE FOR WHAT?

05:16.434 --> 05:17.701
<i>I'LL LET YOU KNOW.</i>

05:17.801 --> 05:20.801
OH, A TIP -
AS A SIGN OF GOODWILL.

05:20.901 --> 05:23.334
TELL YOUR DOCTOR IT'S
POINTLESS TO OPERATE.

05:23.434 --> 05:27.100
ANY ATTEMPT TO REMOVE THE
BULLET WILL KILL HIM.

05:27.200 --> 05:29.100
COME ON.

05:29.200 --> 05:30.334
UH...

05:30.434 --> 05:31.501
COME ON!

05:31.601 --> 05:32.501
UGH...

05:32.601 --> 05:36.300
<groaning>

05:36.400 --> 05:38.667
NO! DON'T!

05:38.767 --> 05:39.934
DON'T WHAT?

05:40.033 --> 05:41.868
WE JUST TALKED TO THE
GUY WHO SHOT JESSE.

05:41.968 --> 05:43.834
HE SAID TRYING TO REMOVE
THE BULLET WILL KILL HIM.

05:43.934 --> 05:49.434
<yelling>

06:04.234 --> 06:05.300
WHAT IS THAT?

06:05.400 --> 06:06.400
WHAT?

06:06.501 --> 06:07.734
TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON!

06:07.834 --> 06:09.100
YOU'RE STARTING TO
MASS AROUND THE BULLET.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.701
THE INCISION HAS TRIGGERED
A DEFENSE MECHANISM.

06:11.801 --> 06:13.200
IT'S USING A PROTON COUPLER

06:13.300 --> 06:15.300
TO CONNECT DIRECTLY TO
YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM.

06:15.400 --> 06:18.167
IT'S USING YOUR OWN POWERS
AGAINST YOU, JESSE.

06:18.267 --> 06:19.434
JESS.

06:19.534 --> 06:21.200
YOU HAVE TO TRY
TO STOP IT, OKAY?

06:21.300 --> 06:22.167
I CAN'T.

06:22.267 --> 06:23.701
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO CONTROL IT.

06:23.801 --> 06:25.334
<whispering>
DOC, WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

06:25.434 --> 06:26.968
I'M NOT SURE.

06:27.067 --> 06:29.033
<whispering>
BUT UNLESS I FIND
A WAY TO STOP IT,

06:29.133 --> 06:30.467
THE MASSING WILL CONTINUE

06:30.567 --> 06:32.534
AND THEN IT WILL REACH
HIS VITAL ORGANS.

06:32.634 --> 06:34.434
IF THEY'RE MASSED FOR TOO LONG,

06:34.534 --> 06:36.467
THE VITAL ORGANS WILL
CEASE TO FUNCTION.

06:36.567 --> 06:39.334
AND JESSE WILL DIE.

06:41.300 --> 06:43.100
<whispering>
THERE'S MORE.

06:43.200 --> 06:44.834
THE BULLET'S EXPLOSIVE.

06:44.934 --> 06:47.567
THAT CREEP WHO SHOT
HIM AS THE DETONATOR.

06:47.667 --> 06:49.567
<whispering>
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

06:49.667 --> 06:50.834
I DON'T KNOW.

06:50.934 --> 06:52.801
BUT HE WILL CALL AGAIN.

06:59.434 --> 07:01.100
OKAY.
I GOT THE TRACE SET UP.

07:01.200 --> 07:02.534
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
KEEP HIM ON THE PHONE

07:02.634 --> 07:04.300
FOR AT LEAST 40 SECONDS.

07:04.400 --> 07:05.801
NO PROBLEM.

07:05.901 --> 07:09.000
<ringing>

07:09.100 --> 07:10.501
YEAH.

07:10.601 --> 07:11.968
<i>HOW'S THE PATIENT DOING?</i>

07:12.067 --> 07:13.000
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

07:13.100 --> 07:14.067
A MUTANT.

07:14.167 --> 07:15.801
HER NAME IS
LAURA BROOKS.

07:15.901 --> 07:18.033
SHE'S BEING HELD IN A POD.

07:18.133 --> 07:19.968
ALL PODS WERE DESTROYED.

07:20.067 --> 07:21.667
<i>NO. NOT HERS.</i>

07:21.767 --> 07:24.667
SHE WAS TAKEN BY THE MILITARY
AFTER THE COLLAPSE OF GENOMEX.

07:24.767 --> 07:26.133
<i>WELL, WHERE IS SHE?</i>

07:26.234 --> 07:28.501
WELL, IF I KNEW THAT, I
WOULDN'T NEED YOU, NOW WOULD I?

07:28.601 --> 07:31.968
<i>I'M AWARE OF THE ACCESS AND
CONNECTIONS MUTANT X HAS.</i>

07:32.067 --> 07:35.234
<i>USE THEM TO FIND HER
AND BRING HER TO ME.</i>

07:35.334 --> 07:39.000
YOU HAVE FOUR HOURS.

07:39.100 --> 07:40.634
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

07:40.734 --> 07:41.767
I'M THINKING REALISTIC HERE.

07:41.868 --> 07:43.334
YOU KNOW, FOUR HOURS
ISN'T POSSIBLE.

07:43.434 --> 07:46.901
<i>YOU BETTER HOPE IT IS IF YOU
WANT YOUR FRIEND TO LIVE.</i>

07:47.000 --> 07:49.968
FOUR HOURS UNTIL I
DETONATE THE BULLET.

07:50.067 --> 07:53.968
IF YOU'VE ACTIVATED ITS
POWERS, MAYBE EVEN LESS.

07:54.067 --> 07:55.934
LOOK, LISTEN TO ME...
<disconnected>

07:56.033 --> 07:58.534
THEY'LL NEVER FIND HER.

07:58.634 --> 08:01.100
THE DOMINION WILL HAVE
BURIED HER TOO DEEP.

08:01.200 --> 08:03.734
THEY'LL HAVE TO IF THEY
WANT THEIR FRIEND TO LIVE.

08:03.834 --> 08:06.634
IT'S A LOT OF TROUBLE
FOR ONE WOMAN.

08:06.734 --> 08:09.634
SHE'S WORTH IT.

08:12.267 --> 08:13.367
OKAY.

08:13.467 --> 08:14.834
I THINK I FOUND IT.

08:19.133 --> 08:22.234
LOOKS LIKE THE CALL
CAME FROM THERE.

08:22.334 --> 08:23.601
WHAT?

08:23.701 --> 08:24.801
OH...

08:24.901 --> 08:26.300
OH, DAMN.

08:26.400 --> 08:28.200
HE'S FOUND A WAY TO ROUTE THE
SIGNALS THROUGH MULTIPLE CELLS.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.534
WE'RE NEVER GOING
TO GET HIM IN TIME.

08:30.634 --> 08:35.467
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO GET HIM WHAT HE WANTS.

08:35.567 --> 08:37.333
JESSE, RELAX.

08:37.433 --> 08:40.433
THE MORE AGITATED YOU ARE, THE
QUICKER THE MASSING WILL SPREAD.

08:40.534 --> 08:42.267
I CAN'T CONTROL IT!

08:42.366 --> 08:45.300
<screaming>

08:45.400 --> 08:47.300
JESSE!

08:47.400 --> 08:48.834
WE'RE LOSING HIM!

08:48.934 --> 08:50.534
THERE'S GOT TO BE
SOMETHING WE CAN DO.

08:50.634 --> 08:52.567
I CAN CONNECT YOUR
MIND DIRECTLY TO HIS.

08:52.667 --> 08:54.300
YOU'RE A FAMILIAR PRESENCE.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.100
GO IN AND STABILIZE HIM.

08:56.200 --> 08:58.467
MAKE HIM FORGET
ABOUT THE BULLET.

08:58.567 --> 09:00.701
I'LL DO WHAT EVER I CAN.

09:00.801 --> 09:03.901
ALL RIGHT. SIT DOWN.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.567
ARE YOU READY?

09:05.667 --> 09:07.667
READY.

09:15.267 --> 09:18.901
<loud rumbling sounds>

09:19.000 --> 09:21.400
<loudly>
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS, JESS?

09:21.501 --> 09:23.400
<yelling>
IT'S THE END!

09:23.501 --> 09:25.033
IT'S OVER.

09:25.133 --> 09:26.434
NO, THIS ISN'T REAL, JESS.

09:26.534 --> 09:28.400
YOU'RE PANICKING.
IT'S YOUR IMAGINATION.

09:28.501 --> 09:30.434
I'M DYING, MAN.

09:30.534 --> 09:33.133
<straining>
OH... OH...

09:37.701 --> 09:38.968
<loudly>
THIS ISN'T REAL,
JESSE.

09:39.067 --> 09:40.634
<struggling>
I'M ONE STEP AWAY FROM DEATH.

09:40.734 --> 09:42.167
THIS IS AS REAL
AS IT GETS.

09:42.267 --> 09:44.934
<yelling>
COME ON, MAN.
YOU CAN'T GIVE UP NOW.

09:45.033 --> 09:47.834
<screaming>

09:47.934 --> 09:58.400
<both straining>

09:58.501 --> 09:59.868
YOU WANT TO LIVE, MAN.

09:59.968 --> 10:02.234
COME ON, YOU GOTTA
THINK OF THE GOOD TIMES.

10:02.334 --> 10:04.601
AGH! AGH!

10:04.701 --> 10:09.067
<panting>

10:11.934 --> 10:13.200
HEY!

10:14.567 --> 10:17.133
I THOUGHT WE AGREED
- NO POWERS.

10:17.234 --> 10:19.801
NO, YOU AGREED.
I SCORED.

10:19.901 --> 10:22.400
<loudly>
I'D FORGOTTEN.

10:22.501 --> 10:24.067
WHAT?

10:25.334 --> 10:27.801
YOU'LL DO ANYTHING TO WIN!

10:27.901 --> 10:29.634
<Doctor's voice echoing>
BRENNAN?

10:31.167 --> 10:33.200
<Doctor's voice echoing>
BRENNAN?

10:38.934 --> 10:40.100
DID IT WORK?

10:40.200 --> 10:41.234
YES.

10:41.334 --> 10:43.501
THE MASSING HAS
STOPPED INCREASING.

10:43.601 --> 10:44.934
NOW THAT HE'S MORE STABLE,

10:45.033 --> 10:47.367
WE HAVE TO TRY AND DISABLE THE
BULLET'S DEFENSE MECHANISM

10:47.467 --> 10:49.367
AND REMOVE IT SAFELY.

10:49.467 --> 10:50.467
OKAY.

10:50.567 --> 10:52.467
WHAT ARE OUR CHANCES?

10:52.567 --> 10:53.601
NOT GOOD.

10:53.701 --> 10:54.834
OH, DOCTOR, YOU
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

10:54.934 --> 10:56.000
HE'S IN THIS
REALLY CRAZY PLACE.

10:56.100 --> 10:57.467
HE BELIEVES
THAT HE'S DYING.

10:57.567 --> 10:59.234
YES, BUT YOU HAVE TO
STAY STRONG FOR HIM.

10:59.334 --> 11:01.934
IF HE SENSES YOUR FEAR,
IT WILL MAKE HIS WORSE.

11:02.033 --> 11:03.400
OKAY.

11:03.501 --> 11:06.267
THEN GIVE ME SOMETHING
TO BELIEVE IN, THEN.

11:06.367 --> 11:07.400
PLEASE?

11:07.501 --> 11:08.968
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL DO THE BEST I CAN.

11:09.067 --> 11:10.467
OKAY.

11:12.901 --> 11:14.934
JESSE?

11:15.033 --> 11:16.234
HOW'S IT COMING?

11:16.334 --> 11:17.300
NOT GOOD.

11:17.400 --> 11:18.334
THE GUY WANTS US TO FIND

11:18.434 --> 11:19.634
A PODDED MUTANT
NAMED LAURA BROOKS,

11:19.734 --> 11:21.167
AND WE'VE GOT ABOUT
THREE HOURS TO FIND HER.

11:21.267 --> 11:23.234
I'VE RUN HER NAME THROUGH
EVERY DATABASE I CAN THINK OF.

11:23.334 --> 11:24.767
AND WHEN GENOMEX WAS DESTROYED,

11:24.868 --> 11:26.400
A LOT OF THE RECORDS
DISAPPEARED.

11:26.501 --> 11:28.467
HE SAID THE MILITARY HAD HER,
BUT WE'VE TRIED THAT, TOO.

11:28.567 --> 11:30.701
I MEAN, WE'VE CRACKED EVERY
MILITARY AND GOVERNMENT BASE.

11:30.801 --> 11:32.033
THERE'S NOTHING.

11:32.133 --> 11:33.334
OUR BEST BET IS
TO GIVE THIS GUY

11:33.434 --> 11:35.901
WHATEVER IT IS THAT HE WANTS
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.267
DON'T WORRY.
WE'RE GOING TO DO IT.

11:38.367 --> 11:40.300
ALL RIGHT, THE DOC AND I SET
UP THE FORCE FIELD CONTAINER

11:40.400 --> 11:42.434
JUST IN CASE WE GET
THE BULLET OUT.

11:42.534 --> 11:43.934
THAT'S GOOD.

11:44.033 --> 11:45.434
I'M GOING TO GO STAY
WITH JESS, OKAY?

11:45.534 --> 11:49.334
JUST LET ME KNOW IF
ANYTHING CHANGES.

11:49.434 --> 11:50.968
WE DON'T HAVE
TIME FOR THIS.

11:51.067 --> 11:53.701
I KNOW.

11:53.801 --> 11:55.701
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

11:55.801 --> 11:57.367
TO TALK TO THE DOMINION.

11:57.467 --> 11:59.000
ADAM SAID WE CAN'T TRUST THEM.

11:59.100 --> 12:00.667
YEAH, BUT THEY DON'T KNOW THAT.

12:00.767 --> 12:03.200
THEY STILL TRUST US.

12:05.267 --> 12:06.834
THE BULLET HAS AN
INTERNAL POWER SUPPLY

12:06.934 --> 12:09.167
THAT ALLOWS US TO
CONTROL JESSE'S NERVOUS SYSTEM.

12:09.267 --> 12:13.067
NOW IF WE CAN STOP THAT,
IT COULD BE RENDERED HARMLESS.

12:13.167 --> 12:14.868
HOW CAN WE DO THAT, THOUGH?

12:14.968 --> 12:16.067
I CAN'T.

12:16.167 --> 12:18.000
BUT MAYBE YOU CAN.

12:18.100 --> 12:19.267
WHAT I'D LIKE YOU TO DO

12:19.367 --> 12:20.968
IS DELIVER A CONTROLLED
ELECTRICAL CHARGE,

12:21.067 --> 12:24.501
ENOUGH TO DAMAGE THE
ELECTRONICS IN THE BULLET.

12:25.634 --> 12:27.100
<i>THAT COULD KILL HIM!</i>

12:27.200 --> 12:29.834
NO, IT WON'T - IF YOU DON'T
DISRUPT HIS HEART RHYTHMS.

12:29.934 --> 12:31.467
<i>OH, YEAH,
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.</i>

12:31.567 --> 12:33.133
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO
KNOW IF I'M DOING THAT?

12:33.234 --> 12:35.934
I'LL TELL YOU.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.334
YEAH...

12:43.434 --> 12:47.734
JESS, YOU STAY WITH ME.

12:47.834 --> 12:49.200
READY.

12:54.834 --> 12:57.400
GOOD, IT'S WORKING.

12:57.501 --> 12:58.434
UH UH.

12:58.534 --> 12:59.801
IT'S TOO MUCH!

12:59.901 --> 13:01.701
NO, GIVE IT MORE.

13:04.267 --> 13:05.801
ALL RIGHT. STOP!

13:06.968 --> 13:08.634
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

13:08.734 --> 13:10.400
THE MASSING HAS STARTED AGAIN.

13:10.501 --> 13:13.400
THE BULLET'S DEFENDING ITSELF.

13:13.501 --> 13:14.701
IT'S GETTING WORSE?

13:14.801 --> 13:17.200
IT'S HEADING FOR HIS LUNGS.

13:17.300 --> 13:19.467
PUT ME BACK IN.

13:21.934 --> 13:25.133
<screaming>

13:27.701 --> 13:30.534
JESS, HOLD ON, MAN.

13:30.634 --> 13:32.667
<struggling>

13:32.767 --> 13:33.934
I SCREWED UP, MAN.

13:34.033 --> 13:35.234
I'M SORRY.
IT'S MY FAULT.

13:35.334 --> 13:38.868
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO HELP.

13:43.133 --> 13:44.234
I GOT YOU NOW.

13:44.334 --> 13:46.167
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

13:46.267 --> 13:47.734
DON'T GIVE UP ON ME, JESS.

13:47.834 --> 13:50.200
I GOT YOU NOW.
WE'RE GOING TO BEAT THIS.

13:52.567 --> 13:54.834
THAT'S GOOD.
COME ON.

13:57.234 --> 13:59.801
JUST REMEMBER -
WE'RE A TEAM.

13:59.901 --> 14:01.501
WE ALWAYS KICK ASS TOGETHER.

14:01.601 --> 14:04.501
RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING,
WE'VE NEVER LOST...

14:04.601 --> 14:06.334
NOW WHEN IS THAT
ECKHART GONNA LEARN?

14:06.434 --> 14:08.734
NO MATTER HOW MANY
GUYS HE SENDS AFTER US,

14:08.834 --> 14:11.200
YOU'RE ALWAYS OUTNUMBERED.

14:11.300 --> 15:00.267
<fighting sounds>

15:03.100 --> 15:05.534
HUH?

15:05.634 --> 15:06.534
NICE.

15:06.634 --> 15:07.901
WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

15:13.634 --> 15:14.934
<i>Doctor's voice:
THAT'S GOOD, BRENNAN.</i>

15:15.033 --> 15:17.000
<i>THE MASSING IS SLOWING.</i>

15:17.100 --> 15:18.801
JESS, GOOD.

15:18.901 --> 15:19.868
YOU'RE GETTING BETTER, MAN.

15:19.968 --> 15:21.834
KEEP CLIMBING.

15:24.367 --> 15:25.467
<struggling>
JUST REMEMBER,

15:25.567 --> 15:28.067
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH WORSE
AND SURVIVED.

15:28.167 --> 15:30.534
THINK ABOUT IT.

15:35.234 --> 15:36.734
JESSE!

15:36.834 --> 15:38.100
JESSE, UNPHASE!

15:38.200 --> 15:39.033
I CAN'T!

15:39.133 --> 15:40.467
JESSE, CONCENTRATE!

15:40.567 --> 15:43.567
THE LONGER YOU STAY UNSTABLE,
THE MORE DANGEROUS IT IS.

15:43.667 --> 15:44.901
JESSE, FOCUS.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.067
COME ON, JESS.

15:46.167 --> 15:47.501
YOU HAVE
A COUPLE OF SECONDS.

15:47.601 --> 15:48.901
AFTER THAT, YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO BE ABLE TO REFORM!

15:49.000 --> 15:52.234
<moaning>

15:52.334 --> 15:53.567
TAKE IT EASY NOW.

15:53.667 --> 16:03.734
<gasping>

16:06.400 --> 16:08.300
GOOD WORK.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.300
I'M PROUD OF YOU, MAN.

16:11.400 --> 16:12.868
NOW THERE'S
A LEDGE ABOVE YOU.

16:12.968 --> 16:14.767
JUST REACH UP WITH
YOUR RIGHT HAND.

16:14.868 --> 16:16.734
<struggling>
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

16:16.834 --> 16:17.934
JUST REACH THAT HANDHOLD.

16:18.033 --> 16:20.501
IT'S RIGHT ABOVE YOU.

16:20.601 --> 16:23.901
<straining>

16:24.000 --> 16:26.834
<shouting>
YOU CAN DO IT.
COME ON!

16:26.934 --> 16:30.868
<explosive sounds>

16:30.968 --> 16:34.667
<straining>

16:34.767 --> 16:36.701
JUST REST A BIT.

16:39.701 --> 16:41.467
<i>WHAT YOU'RE ASKING
IS IMPOSSIBLE.</i>

16:41.567 --> 16:43.300
I'M ASKING YOU TO
FIND ONE WOMAN.

16:43.400 --> 16:45.133
<i>YOU WANT US TO LOCATE
A DANGEROUS MUTANT</i>

16:45.234 --> 16:47.400
<i>SO YOU CAN DELIVER HER
TO AN UNKNOWN OPERATIVE</i>

16:47.501 --> 16:48.868
<i>FOR AN UNKNOWN REASON.</i>

16:48.968 --> 16:50.200
YEAH, WELL,
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN!

16:50.300 --> 16:51.667
JESSE'S DYING.

16:51.767 --> 16:54.200
<i>YOU SEEM TO HAVE LOST
YOUR USUAL GOOD JUDGMENT.</i>

16:54.300 --> 16:57.434
<i>PERHAPS YOU'VE BECOME OVERLY
INVOLVED WITH MUTANT X.</i>

16:57.534 --> 16:59.601
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?

16:59.701 --> 17:01.267
I LIVE WITH HIM.
I WORK WITH HIM.

17:01.367 --> 17:03.834
HE'S SAVED MY LIFE.
OF COURSE, I'M INVOLVED.

17:03.934 --> 17:06.534
I'M NOT GOING TO LET HIM DIE.

17:06.634 --> 17:09.767
<i>YOU SURPRISE ME, MISS PIERCE.</i>

17:09.867 --> 17:12.300
<i>I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.</i>

17:14.099 --> 17:16.233
YOU SURPRISE ME, TOO.

17:18.133 --> 17:22.701
SO DO YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT HIM
OR WAS THAT ALL JUST FOR EFFECT?

17:22.800 --> 17:24.934
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

17:31.801 --> 17:36.767
<i><struggling, straining></i>

17:36.868 --> 17:41.601
<panting>

17:41.701 --> 17:44.000
<shouting>
YOU HAVE ONE HELL
OF AN IMAGINATION!

17:44.100 --> 17:46.400
YEAH.

17:46.501 --> 17:49.067
<shouting>
YOU KNOW, I NEVER THOUGHT
IT'D BE LIKE THIS.

17:49.167 --> 17:52.067
WHAT?

17:52.167 --> 17:53.767
DYING.

17:53.868 --> 17:55.434
I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WOULD
BE FOR SOMETHING MEANINGFUL,

17:55.534 --> 17:58.400
NOT AN AMBUSH BY SOME
GUY I DON'T EVEN KNOW.

17:58.501 --> 18:00.901
YOU'RE NOT DYING.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.200
<screaming>

18:02.300 --> 18:03.834
JESS!

18:07.133 --> 18:10.367
<i>Doctor:
BRENNAN, YOU HAVE
TO COME OUT OF THERE!</i>

18:13.767 --> 18:15.167
WHY'D YOU PULL ME OUT?

18:15.267 --> 18:16.601
WE'VE HAD A SETBACK.

18:16.701 --> 18:17.968
THE MASSING
IS GETTING WORSE.

18:18.067 --> 18:19.601
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

18:19.701 --> 18:21.067
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

18:21.167 --> 18:23.367
THE MIND AND BODY
ARE TOTALLY INSEPARABLE.

18:23.467 --> 18:24.634
WHEN I CONNECT YOU,

18:24.734 --> 18:29.434
YOUR ENTIRE BEING
IS LINKED TO JESSE'S.

18:29.534 --> 18:34.667
IF JESSE DIES WHILE YOU'RE
CONNECTED, YOU'LL DIE, TOO.

18:34.767 --> 18:36.801
THEN DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

18:36.901 --> 18:39.400
PUT ME BACK IN.

18:41.734 --> 18:46.400
<distant sirens>

18:49.701 --> 18:51.767
THE WOMAN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
IS IN A GOVERNMENT WAREHOUSE,

18:51.868 --> 18:54.100
UNIT 2509.

18:54.200 --> 18:57.267
ALL THE INFORMATION
YOU'LL NEED IS IN HERE.

18:57.367 --> 19:01.000
YOU SHOULD HAVE NO
PROBLEM GETTING IN.

19:01.100 --> 19:02.801
LEXA...

19:02.901 --> 19:04.000
YOU'LL BE HELD RESPONSIBLE

19:04.100 --> 19:06.934
FOR ANY ADVERSE
CONSEQUENCES OF THIS ACTION.

19:07.033 --> 19:08.434
I ALREADY KNEW THAT.

19:08.534 --> 19:11.701
PERSONAL INVOLVEMENT IS A BAD
IDEA IN OUR LINE OF WORK.

19:11.801 --> 19:13.868
YEAH, WELL, SOMETIMES
IT'S UNAVOIDABLE.

19:13.968 --> 19:15.734
I'D BE SORRY TO LOSE YOU.

19:15.834 --> 19:18.300
YOU'RE ONE OF MY
BEST OPERATIVES.

19:18.400 --> 19:22.667
WELL, THAT SOUNDS LIKE A
LITTLE PERSONAL INVOLVEMENT.

19:22.767 --> 19:25.234
NOT AT ALL.

19:25.334 --> 19:27.234
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP TONIGHT.

19:30.901 --> 19:34.501
<struggling>

19:34.601 --> 19:36.767
<shouting>
JUST LET ME GO!

19:36.868 --> 19:38.601
THERE'S NO POINT!

19:38.701 --> 19:40.400
I NEVER THOUGHT YOU
WERE SUCH A COWARD!

19:40.501 --> 19:43.067
I'M NOT A COWARD.

19:43.167 --> 19:46.300
I JUST CAN'T HOLD ON ANYMORE.

19:46.400 --> 19:48.000
YOU'RE GIVING UP, JESS.

19:48.100 --> 19:49.133
THAT'S NOT YOU.

19:49.234 --> 19:51.767
YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME.

19:51.868 --> 19:56.033
<screaming>

20:01.501 --> 20:02.968
<shouting>
HANG ON, JESS.

20:03.067 --> 20:04.901
YOU JUST GOTTA REMEMBER
THE GOOD TIMES.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.400
WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER.

20:06.501 --> 20:08.400
JUST LIKE WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN.

20:11.934 --> 20:13.868
SO, SOLDIER, DO YOU THINK
YOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES

20:13.968 --> 20:17.133
TO BECOME A MEMBER
OF OUR TUNNEL QUEST TEAM?

20:40.968 --> 20:44.467
<laser fire>

20:49.000 --> 20:50.567
HEY!

21:13.868 --> 21:15.067
THAT WAS CLOSE.

21:15.167 --> 21:16.567
YEAH, TELL ME ABOUT IT.

21:16.667 --> 21:19.467
GOOD JOB, GIRL.

21:19.567 --> 21:22.567
<laser fire>

21:24.000 --> 21:26.133
AH, THAT'S IT.

21:26.234 --> 21:27.501
I'M HITTING THE SHOWER.

21:27.601 --> 21:29.367
ME FIRST.

21:31.400 --> 21:33.634
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU
GUYS THINK YOU'RE DOING?

21:33.734 --> 21:37.400
JUST HAVING A
LITTLE INNOCENT FUN.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.667
LEX, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'VE DONE THERE.

21:40.767 --> 21:42.434
I'VE TOTALLY IMPROVED
SANCTUARY'S HOLO SYSTEM

21:42.534 --> 21:44.801
BY MODIFYING THE GAME
TO MATCH OUR...

21:44.901 --> 21:46.434
SPECS.

21:46.534 --> 21:49.334
<i>NICE GOING, NERD-WONDER.
NOW DELETE IT.</i>

21:49.434 --> 21:50.634
WHAT?

21:50.734 --> 21:51.834
DO IT!

21:51.934 --> 21:53.534
OR I'LL SMASH YOUR
COMPUTER IN HALF.

21:53.634 --> 21:56.000
SHAL, YOU ARE TOTALLY
OVERREACTING.

21:57.067 --> 21:58.467
WELL, I GUESS IT WAS
FUN WHILE IT LASTED.

21:58.567 --> 22:00.834
DUDE, THIS IS
TOTALLY YOUR FAULT.

22:02.434 --> 22:04.234
<yelling>
JESS, YOU GOTTA HELP
YOURSELF UP, MAN!!

22:04.334 --> 22:06.400
COME ON!
PULL YOURSELF UP!

22:06.501 --> 22:07.434
I CAN'T.

22:07.534 --> 22:08.767
BE STRONG, JESSE.

22:08.868 --> 22:10.167
COME ON!

22:10.267 --> 22:12.934
<quietly>
THE POD WE'RE LOOKING
FOR IS HERE SOMEWHERE.

22:32.534 --> 22:34.033
YOU STOPPED THE
SPREAD OF MASSING,

22:34.133 --> 22:35.801
BUT IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

22:35.901 --> 22:37.200
BLOOD OXYGEN IS LOW.

22:37.300 --> 22:39.067
HIS LUNGS ARE AFFECTED.

22:39.167 --> 22:41.300
<yelling>
YOU NEED TO WORK HARDER, MAN.

22:41.400 --> 22:42.834
YOU NEED TO SHRINK THE MASSING.

22:42.934 --> 22:44.501
I CAN'T.

22:44.601 --> 22:47.934
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN
STRONGER THAN YOU THINK.

22:48.033 --> 22:49.701
YEAH.

22:52.167 --> 22:53.667
EVERYBODY READY?

22:53.767 --> 22:56.033
GO!

22:56.133 --> 23:00.834
<i><loud rumbling></i>

23:00.934 --> 23:04.334
I'M PICKING UP SOME ACTIVITY
ABOUT TWO MILES FROM HERE.

23:04.434 --> 23:06.601
TWO PLANES AND THEY'RE
HEADED THIS WAY.

23:08.133 --> 23:10.000
MISSILES- LOOK OUT!

23:15.400 --> 23:16.701
OKAY, LOOK, I'M GOING
TO TRY SOMETHING.

23:16.801 --> 23:18.467
HOLD ON TO YOUR SEATS, GUYS.

23:18.567 --> 23:20.400
GET READY TO DIVE.

23:21.767 --> 23:22.934
GO!

THEY'RE COMING BACK AT US.

23:43.300 --> 23:44.501
DO THEY HAVE MISSILE LOCK?

23:44.601 --> 23:46.567
I'M NOT GOING TO BE
ABLE TO DO THAT AGAIN.

23:46.667 --> 23:48.334
JESSE, YOU HAVE TO
PHASE THE HELIX.

23:48.434 --> 23:49.334
I CAN'T DO THAT.

23:49.434 --> 23:50.901
BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY
OTHER CHOICE.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.167
JUST DO IT!

23:52.267 --> 23:53.300
YOU CAN TRY!

23:53.400 --> 23:54.334
JESSE, YOU HAVE TO.

23:54.434 --> 23:55.467
YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

23:55.567 --> 23:58.667
THEY'RE GETTING CLOSER.

23:58.767 --> 24:00.701
JESSE...
DO IT!

24:05.734 --> 24:07.000
COME ON, BROTHER.

24:08.300 --> 24:09.801
COME ON.

24:10.501 --> 24:12.567
AGH...!

24:18.901 --> 24:20.334
AGH...!

24:20.434 --> 24:29.234
<missle sounds>

24:32.267 --> 24:35.000
YEAH.

24:35.100 --> 24:37.667
IS THAT WHAT IT FEELS
LIKE WHEN YOU PHASE?

24:39.634 --> 24:41.467
I DON'T THINK I
COULD DO THAT AGAIN.

24:41.567 --> 24:43.601
WELL, YOU MAY NOT HAVE TO.

24:45.734 --> 24:47.100
<explosion>

24:47.200 --> 24:49.868
OH!
DIRECT HIT.

24:49.968 --> 24:51.167
YES.

24:51.267 --> 24:53.033
LET'S GO HOME.

24:58.901 --> 25:00.067
SEE?

25:00.167 --> 25:02.000
YOU DIDN'T THINK YOU
COULD DO IT THEN EITHER.

25:05.934 --> 25:07.200
Doctor:
IT'S WORKING.

25:07.300 --> 25:10.167
THE MASSING IS SHRINKING.

25:10.267 --> 25:12.467
KEEP IT UP.
YOU'RE DOING IT.

25:12.567 --> 25:14.567
<struggling sounds>

25:14.667 --> 25:17.634
SHALIMAR AND LEXA ARE GOING TO
DELIVER WHAT THIS GUY WANTS.

25:17.734 --> 25:20.000
IT'S ALMOST OVER.

25:37.934 --> 25:40.767
<i><buzzing and mechanical noises></i>

25:54.767 --> 25:56.501
THAT'S WEIRD.

25:56.601 --> 25:58.767
SOMEONE INSIDE?

25:58.868 --> 26:00.434
NO. THAT'S JUST IT.

26:00.534 --> 26:03.400
NO ONE'S BEEN HERE
FOR A LONG TIME.

26:07.167 --> 26:09.667
<buzzing of lights>

26:09.767 --> 26:11.534
CREEPY PLACE.

26:11.634 --> 26:12.834
YEAH.

26:12.934 --> 26:16.300
DON'T SUPPOSE THE DOMINION
LAID A TRAP FOR US...

26:16.400 --> 26:18.167
I DON'T KNOW.

26:22.834 --> 26:24.200
IT'S HERE.

26:24.300 --> 26:26.567
I DON'T LIKE THIS.

26:26.667 --> 26:28.267
THIS IS WAY TOO EASY.

26:28.367 --> 26:31.467
LOOK, LET'S JUST GET HER AND
GET OUT OF HERE, ALL RIGHT?

26:35.434 --> 26:37.634
SHE'S DEAD.

26:39.901 --> 26:41.968
NO!

26:43.100 --> 26:45.000
OH, GOD.

26:48.100 --> 26:50.167
<phone ringing>

26:50.267 --> 26:52.267
GREAT.

26:53.400 --> 26:54.434
YES.

26:54.534 --> 26:55.534
TICK TOCK.

26:55.634 --> 26:57.734
DID YOU LOCATE HER?

26:57.834 --> 27:00.267
WELL, WE HAVE THE POD, BUT...

27:00.367 --> 27:01.767
WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO REVIVE HER.

27:01.868 --> 27:03.601
<i>OF COURSE YOU DO.</i>

27:03.701 --> 27:05.767
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT
STALLING FOR TIME

27:05.868 --> 27:08.968
IN THE VAIN HOPE YOUR
DOCTOR WILL BE OF SOME USE.

27:09.067 --> 27:12.601
<i>I ASSURE YOU I KNOW MORE ABOUT
JESSE'S ANATOMY THAN ANY DOCTOR.</i>

27:12.701 --> 27:15.467
I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN SAVE HIM.

27:19.234 --> 27:20.901
WHO'D KNOW THAT
MUCH ABOUT JESSE?

27:21.000 --> 27:22.634
I DON'T KNOW
BUT JESSE MIGHT.

27:22.734 --> 27:23.801
BRENNAN?

27:23.901 --> 27:24.934
DID YOU GET THE WOMAN?

27:25.033 --> 27:26.000
YEAH,
SHE DIED IN THE POD.

27:26.100 --> 27:27.467
DAMN.

27:27.567 --> 27:29.501
THE GUY WHO SHOT JESSE CLAIMS
TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM.

27:29.601 --> 27:31.267
IT'S GOT TO BE
SOMEBODY JESS KNOWS.

27:31.367 --> 27:34.467
YEAH,
I'LL TRY AND FIND OUT.

27:34.567 --> 27:36.033
THE WOMAN WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO DELIVER IS DEAD.

27:36.133 --> 27:38.033
AND THE BOMB'S GOING TO
EXPLODE IN FIFTEEN MINUTES.

27:38.133 --> 27:39.868
WELL, THEN,
I HAVE NO CHOICE.

27:39.968 --> 27:41.234
I HAVE TO OPERATE.

27:41.334 --> 27:42.767
OKAY.

27:42.868 --> 27:44.400
NOW, WE KNOW HE CAN CONTROL
THE MASSING, EVEN SHRINK IT.

27:44.501 --> 27:46.467
I WANT YOU TO MAKE
SURE HE BELIEVES THAT.

27:46.567 --> 27:49.801
OKAY. I NEED TO TALK TO HIM
BEFORE YOU MAKE THE
OPERATION HAPPEN.

27:49.901 --> 27:50.868
MAKE IT QUICK.

27:50.968 --> 27:52.334
OKAY.

27:55.534 --> 27:57.934
IT'S SOMEONE WHO'S EXAMINED ME?

27:58.033 --> 27:59.567
KNOWS MY MUTANT ANATOMY?

27:59.667 --> 28:01.133
YEAH.

28:01.234 --> 28:03.033
HOW DOES THE BULLET WORK?

28:03.133 --> 28:07.033
THE DOCTOR SAYS IT'S
USING A PROTON COUPLER...

28:07.133 --> 28:08.300
PROTON COUPLER?

28:08.400 --> 28:09.901
YEAH. WHY?

28:10.000 --> 28:11.868
WHEN I WAS AT GENOMEX...

28:13.767 --> 28:14.901
SCAN HIS SYSTEM.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.334
I WANT TO TRY SOME
NEUROLOGICAL EXPERIMENTS.

28:17.434 --> 28:18.634
THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS.

28:18.734 --> 28:21.133
HE MIGHT NOT SURVIVE...

28:21.234 --> 28:22.868
YES.

28:22.968 --> 28:24.534
START WITH THE PROTON COUPLER.

28:24.634 --> 28:28.067
THAT SHOULD ALLOW ME TO
ESTABLISH CONTROL OF HIS
NERVOUS SYSTEM.

28:30.601 --> 28:34.701
IT'S ECKHART'S RIGHT
HAND MAN, DR. HARRISON.

28:34.801 --> 28:36.667
GO GET HIM FOR ME.

28:39.100 --> 28:42.000
AGH... AGH...

28:46.033 --> 28:47.901
GUYS, IT'S HARRISON.
FROM GENOMEX.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.601
YOU GOTTA FIND HIM.

28:49.701 --> 28:51.267
ARE YOU SURE YOU
WANT TO DO THIS?

28:51.367 --> 28:53.200
I CAN'T GUARANTEE ANYTHING.

28:53.300 --> 28:54.501
DO WHATEVER IT IS
YOU HAVE TO DO.

28:54.601 --> 28:56.934
I'M NOT LETTING HIM
DIE IN THERE ALONE.

29:03.567 --> 29:05.801
JESS, YOU'VE ALREADY
DONE THIS BEFORE.

29:05.901 --> 29:07.534
ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS FIGHT.

29:07.634 --> 29:10.167
WORK WITH ME!

29:15.567 --> 29:17.300
OKAY WELL, THAT BULLET
FRIED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM.

29:17.400 --> 29:19.133
MUST HAVE SHEARED
A HYDRAULIC LINE.

29:19.234 --> 29:23.501
<computer beeping>
<loud engine noises>

29:23.601 --> 29:24.567
PULL UP!

29:24.667 --> 29:26.434
I'M TRYING! THE
CONTROLS ARE FROZEN!

29:26.534 --> 29:27.501
WE GOTTA LAND NOW!

29:27.601 --> 29:28.567
LAND?!

29:28.667 --> 29:29.868
JESS, I CAN'T EVEN
KEEP HER LEVEL!

29:29.968 --> 29:37.033
<computer beeping>
<loud engine noises>

29:37.133 --> 29:38.234
STILL FROZEN!

29:38.334 --> 29:39.834
WE'RE AT LESS THAN
TWO THOUSAND FEET.

29:39.934 --> 29:41.033
ANY IDEAS?

29:41.133 --> 29:43.200
UH, YES.

29:43.300 --> 29:44.534
MAYBE YOU COULD TRY

29:44.634 --> 29:46.367
JUICING ONE OF THE HYDRAULIC
LINES IN AN ELECTRICAL ARC,

29:46.467 --> 29:47.634
IT MIGHT HEAT UP
THE FLUID ENOUGH

29:47.734 --> 29:48.734
TO GIVE US THE
PRESSURE WE NEED,

29:48.834 --> 29:49.834
BUT I DON'T KNOW, BRENNAN.

29:49.934 --> 29:50.968
TAKE THE CONTROLS.

29:51.067 --> 29:52.267
ALL RIGHT.

29:54.968 --> 29:58.334
IT'S WORKING, BRENNAN!

30:00.067 --> 30:01.601
WE'VE LEVELED OFF,
FIFTEEN HUNDRED FEET.

30:01.701 --> 30:02.968
NICE.

30:03.067 --> 30:05.200
GUYS, THERE'S A
SCHOOLYARD BELOW US.

30:05.300 --> 30:07.234
OKAY, I'M TAKING HER DOWN.

30:08.167 --> 30:12.167
<crashing noises>

30:14.834 --> 30:16.968
THAT WASN'T SO BAD, HUH?

30:20.133 --> 30:22.200
<screaming>

30:24.200 --> 30:25.400
JESSE!

30:25.501 --> 30:28.200
YOU GOTTA FIGHT IT!

30:28.300 --> 30:32.067
WHENEVER HENRY TRIES TO MAKE
YOU BELIEVE THIS, IT'S NOT REAL.

30:32.167 --> 30:33.767
IT'S A DREAMSCAPE.

30:33.868 --> 30:35.200
ALL RIGHT?

30:35.300 --> 30:36.767
IT'S HAPPENING IN YOUR MIND.

30:36.868 --> 30:38.400
IT'S NOT REAL UNLESS
I BELIEVE IT, YEAH.

30:38.501 --> 30:40.133
THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S ONLY IN YOUR MIND.

30:40.234 --> 30:41.033
OKAY.

30:41.133 --> 30:42.701
IT'S ONLY IN YOUR MIND.

30:42.801 --> 30:46.300
<screaming>

30:46.400 --> 30:47.300
I KNOW THIS IS NOT REAL.

30:47.400 --> 30:49.367
THIS...
THIS IS NOT REAL.

30:49.467 --> 30:51.701
NICE TRY, MR. KILMARTIN.

30:51.801 --> 30:53.033
I'M SORRY,

30:53.133 --> 30:56.868
BUT WHAT IS HAPPENING
TO YOU NOW IS VERY REAL.

30:56.968 --> 30:59.000
OH... OH...

30:59.100 --> 31:00.868
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO...

31:00.968 --> 31:01.834
HEY, NO.

31:01.934 --> 31:02.667
NO.

31:02.767 --> 31:03.567
NO, THERE...

31:03.667 --> 31:05.067
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

31:05.167 --> 31:06.300
NO. NO. NO...

31:08.067 --> 31:12.567
ARE YOU ASKING TO
NEGOTIATE YOUR FREEDOM

31:12.667 --> 31:14.667
FOR CERTAIN INFORMATION,
MR. KILMARTIN?

31:14.767 --> 31:16.234
WHAT SORT OF INFORMATION?

31:16.334 --> 31:17.534
LOCATION OF SANCTUARY.

31:17.634 --> 31:20.033
THE DATABASE OF THE
NEW MUTANT UNDERGROUND.

31:22.701 --> 31:24.467
I DIDN'T THINK SO.

31:24.567 --> 31:27.467
YOUR FERAL FRIEND WASN'T
MUCH HELP EITHER...

31:27.567 --> 31:30.834
NOT THAT
THAT MATTERS ANYMORE.

31:31.767 --> 31:33.000
WHERE IS SHE?

31:33.100 --> 31:35.434
WHERE IS SHE?
TELL ME WHERE SHE IS!

31:35.534 --> 31:37.501
TELL ME! TELL ME!

31:37.601 --> 31:38.501
OH!

31:38.601 --> 31:41.734
<screaming>

31:41.834 --> 31:42.801
DON'T!

31:42.901 --> 31:44.834
NO... NO...

31:44.934 --> 31:48.501
<crying>

31:48.601 --> 31:51.200
IT'S NO USE, BRENNAN.
I CAN'T DO IT.

31:51.300 --> 31:52.434
I KNOW YOU CAN DO THIS.

31:52.534 --> 31:54.367
IT'S BEEN A LOT
TOUGHER BEFORE.

31:54.467 --> 31:56.968
AGH!

32:02.200 --> 32:10.133
<moaning, wheezing>

32:10.234 --> 32:11.467
ADAM, WHERE DOES IT SAY

32:11.567 --> 32:15.400
THAT YOU GET TO MAKE THE
DECISIONS FOR EVERYBODY?

32:15.501 --> 32:16.801
WHAT?

32:16.901 --> 32:18.033
JESSE, ARE YOU OKAY?

32:18.133 --> 32:19.667
WAS I TALKING TO YOU?

32:19.767 --> 32:21.534
HEY, WHOA... HEY, DON'T USE
THAT TONE ON ME, ADAM!

32:21.634 --> 32:23.734
I'VE HAD IT!

32:25.767 --> 32:27.934
AND I'VE HAD IT WITH YOUR
ATTITUDE TOO, JESSE.

32:28.033 --> 32:29.200
AGH...!

32:29.300 --> 32:31.100
HEY! HEY!
WAIT...!

32:31.200 --> 32:32.434
UGH...

32:39.567 --> 32:41.300
WAIT!

32:51.868 --> 32:52.901
HEY!

32:53.000 --> 32:55.133
STOP IT, YOU TWO!

32:59.801 --> 33:01.367
SHALIMAR...

33:01.467 --> 33:03.734
OH...

33:03.834 --> 33:05.767
YOU ALL RIGHT?
YEAH, I'M FINE.

33:13.267 --> 33:15.767
ALMOST GOT IT.

33:17.167 --> 33:19.567
<critical beeping>

33:19.667 --> 33:25.334
<monitor flatline>

33:25.434 --> 33:26.634
COME ON, JESSE.

33:26.734 --> 33:28.734
COME ON!
YOU CAN DO IT!

33:28.834 --> 33:30.334
JESSE, COME ON.

33:30.434 --> 33:31.968
COME ON, JESS.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.367
COME ON, JESSE!

33:34.467 --> 33:36.367
COME ON! COME ON!

33:36.467 --> 33:46.901
<flatline tone>

33:48.234 --> 33:50.067
I CAN'T HOLD ON ANY LONGER.

33:50.167 --> 33:51.200
JESSE!

33:51.300 --> 33:52.634
FIGHT IT!

33:52.734 --> 33:53.567
NO.

33:53.667 --> 33:57.367
<screaming>

33:57.467 --> 33:59.434
<struggling>

33:59.534 --> 34:00.734
LET ME GO.

34:00.834 --> 34:03.033
NO!
NOT A CHANCE!

34:03.133 --> 34:04.968
IF YOU DIE, I DIE.

34:05.067 --> 34:06.834
UGH...

34:06.934 --> 34:09.132
<heart rate beeping>

34:11.934 --> 34:14.067
COME ON!

34:14.167 --> 34:15.801
I DON'T WANT YOU TO DIE.

34:15.900 --> 34:17.132
NOT A CHANCE.

34:17.234 --> 34:18.667
YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME.

34:18.766 --> 34:20.167
AGH!

34:20.266 --> 34:22.132
YOU GOT TO CONCENTRATE
ON SURVIVING!

34:22.234 --> 34:25.634
YOU GOT TO REMEMBER
WHY YOU WANT TO LIVE!

34:25.734 --> 34:28.300
ALRIGHT, I TAKE BACK ANYTHING
BAD I EVER SAID ABOUT YOU.

34:28.400 --> 34:31.100
AH...
I'M GOING TO REMEMBER THAT.

34:31.199 --> 34:32.567
<laughing>

34:32.667 --> 34:33.868
NICE INSTALLATION.

34:33.967 --> 34:35.501
TOP-NOTCH SECURITY SYSTEMS.

34:35.601 --> 34:37.033
WELL, SINCE HE'S A HOLOGRAM,

34:37.132 --> 34:38.766
HIS
WEAPONS CAN'T HURT US, RIGHT?

34:38.868 --> 34:40.868
NOT AS FAR AS I KNOW.

34:40.967 --> 34:42.701
<laser fire>

34:42.801 --> 34:49.000
UGH... UGH...
<loud electrical buzzing>

34:49.100 --> 34:51.634
JESS! DO SOMETHING!

34:57.834 --> 34:59.133
WHO ARE YOU?

34:59.234 --> 35:02.601
SERGEANT KNOLL,
TUNNEL SQUAD UNIT LEADER.

35:02.701 --> 35:05.901
THINK YOU COULD WITHSTAND
AN INCREASE IN THE VOLTAGE?

35:06.000 --> 35:10.300
AGH! AGH...!

35:10.400 --> 35:12.667
<loud buzzing>

35:12.767 --> 35:14.734
AAGH!!

35:16.534 --> 35:19.701
I REALLY EXPECTED YOU TO
PUT UP MUCH MORE OF A FIGHT.

35:19.801 --> 35:21.434
GAME OVER, BOYS.

35:21.534 --> 35:23.400
SWEET DREAMS.

35:25.467 --> 35:27.934
BRENNAN...

35:28.033 --> 35:41.200
<coughing>

35:41.300 --> 35:42.701
COME, JESSE, WE'VE
GOT TO GO UP, MAN.

35:42.801 --> 35:44.100
COME ON.

35:44.200 --> 35:46.868
COME ON, BUDDY.
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT.

35:46.968 --> 35:52.767
<coughing>

35:52.868 --> 35:54.801
STAY WITH ME, BUDDY,
WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT.

35:54.901 --> 36:09.701
<coughing>

36:11.467 --> 36:14.234
THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT
TO TELL YOU, BRENNAN.

36:18.234 --> 36:20.567
YEAH, YEAH.
I LOVE YOU, TOO, MAN.

36:20.667 --> 36:22.434
NO.

36:22.534 --> 36:25.534
YOU SUCK AT BASKETBALL.

36:25.634 --> 36:27.467
THAT'S THE BIG THING?

36:27.567 --> 36:29.167
THAT...
THAT'S IT?

36:29.267 --> 36:31.267
THAT'S THE BIG THING THAT
YOU WANTED TO TELL ME?

36:31.367 --> 36:35.133
<coughing>

36:35.234 --> 36:38.667
AND WHAT YOU SAID.

36:40.701 --> 36:42.934
JESSE, COME ON.

36:43.033 --> 36:44.868
COME ON!

36:47.968 --> 36:50.167
I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT, MAN.

36:53.634 --> 36:54.834
ANY LUCK YET?

36:54.934 --> 36:56.400
HARRISON'S BEEN OPERATING
OUT OF A DOZEN FRONTS

36:56.501 --> 36:57.834
OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS.

36:57.934 --> 36:59.267
GOOD.

36:59.367 --> 37:00.634
I'VE STILL GOT THE TRACE
FROM HIS CELL PHONE CALL.

37:00.734 --> 37:02.734
ONE OF THOSE HITS
HAS GOT TO BE REAL.

37:02.834 --> 37:03.934
AND SO WE SUPERIMPOSE

37:04.033 --> 37:05.901
THE LOCATIONS OF
HARRISON'S FRONT COMPANIES.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.200
PERFECT...

37:10.234 --> 37:11.200
GOT HIM.

37:11.300 --> 37:13.501
RANE INDUSTRIES, 14TH STREET.

37:17.300 --> 37:18.801
IT'S ONLY A LITTLE FURTHER.

37:18.901 --> 37:20.601
IT'S NOT EASY, BRO.

37:20.701 --> 37:21.968
CAN'T GIVE UP.

37:22.067 --> 37:23.701
THINK ABOUT ALL THE
PEOPLE THAT YOU LOVE.

37:23.801 --> 37:25.767
ALL THE PEOPLE
THAT YOU'VE HELPED.

37:25.868 --> 37:28.634
YOU CAN'T LEAVE THEM.

37:30.167 --> 37:31.200
I'M NOT COMING WITH YOU.

37:31.300 --> 37:33.067
WHAT?

37:35.667 --> 37:37.267
WHY?

37:37.367 --> 37:39.501
WE'RE DIFFERENT, JESS.

37:39.601 --> 37:42.601
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS A KID, THE
ONLY THING I EVER THOUGHT ABOUT

37:42.701 --> 37:45.400
WAS TAKING CARE OF MY BROTHER.

37:45.501 --> 37:51.067
EVERYTHING I DID FOR
ECKHART, ADAM, THE DOMINION,

37:51.167 --> 37:53.834
WAS ALL ABOUT SAVING LEO
- AND I SCREWED IT UP!

37:53.934 --> 37:57.601
LOOK, WHEN I FIRST CAME
HERE, I WAS MESSED UP, TOO.

37:57.701 --> 38:00.000
THE LAST THING I
THOUGHT I WANTED WAS...

38:00.100 --> 38:03.067
JOIN A BUNCH OF FREAKS
IN A CAVE BUT...

38:03.167 --> 38:05.601
LEXA, ONCE I WAS IN,
I FOUND SOMETHING

38:05.701 --> 38:07.467
THAT I COULD NEVER
FIND ON THE OUTSIDE.

38:07.567 --> 38:10.734
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN MY LIFE, I FIT IN.

38:10.834 --> 38:13.234
YOU'RE A PART OF THAT, NOW.

38:13.334 --> 38:18.100
AGH...

38:22.300 --> 38:26.267
<ringing>

38:26.367 --> 38:28.534
<i>Harrison:
TIME IS ALMOST UP.
HAVE YOU GOT HER?</i>

38:28.634 --> 38:29.601
YEAH.

38:29.701 --> 38:31.067
<i>PUT HER ON.</i>

38:31.167 --> 38:32.601
WELL, IT'LL BE A MINUTE.

38:32.701 --> 38:34.400
<i>DON'T PLAY ME.</i>

38:34.501 --> 38:36.968
<i>I WILL DETONATE THE BULLET.</i>

38:49.934 --> 38:50.901
BRENNAN!

38:51.000 --> 38:52.133
I CAN'T REACH THE BULLET!

38:52.234 --> 38:54.767
IT'S USING JESSE'S
ABILITY TO PHASE ITSELF.

38:54.868 --> 38:56.467
<i>I CAN'T TOUCH IT!</i>

38:56.567 --> 38:58.434
YOU COULD PULL OUT THE BULLET
IF IT WAS SOLID, RIGHT?

38:58.534 --> 38:59.901
<i>YES, BUT I ALREADY
TOLD YOU THAT IT...</i>

39:00.000 --> 39:00.834
JESSE!

39:00.934 --> 39:02.200
YOU GOTTA CONCENTRATE!

39:02.300 --> 39:03.300
YOU GOTTA MASS OUT THE BULLET

39:03.400 --> 39:05.100
SO THE DOCTOR CAN
GET A GRIP ON IT.

39:05.200 --> 39:06.667
CAN YOU DO THAT?

39:06.767 --> 39:08.167
I CAN'T.

39:08.267 --> 39:11.734
IT'S OUR ONLY CHANCE
TO KEEP US BOTH ALIVE.

39:11.834 --> 39:14.834
COME ON, MAN.
I KNOW YOU GOT IT IN YOU.

39:14.934 --> 39:16.634
YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT IT IN YOU.

39:16.734 --> 39:18.067
FIGHT IT, JESS!

39:18.167 --> 39:20.567
MASS OUT THE BULLET!

39:20.667 --> 39:22.067
AGH!

39:22.167 --> 39:24.701
COME ON, ONLY A
LITTLE BIT FURTHER!

39:24.801 --> 39:28.133
COME ON, I KNOW
YOU CAN DO IT, MAN!

39:40.100 --> 39:42.367
NO MORE STALLING.

39:42.467 --> 39:44.701
YOU HEARD THE MAN.

39:52.300 --> 39:54.167
YOU DON'T HAVE HER.

39:56.100 --> 39:58.267
<beeping>

40:02.300 --> 40:04.334
YOU NEVER HAD HER.

40:04.434 --> 40:07.000
BYE BYE, JESSE.
BRENNAN, IT'S GONNA BLOW!!

40:08.601 --> 40:10.801
<explosion>

40:13.200 --> 40:14.501
IT'S ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

40:14.601 --> 40:17.133
I GOT THE BULLET IN
THE CONTAINER IN TIME.

40:18.701 --> 40:20.968
JESSE'S ALIVE.
LUCKY YOU.

40:22.200 --> 40:25.133
WHERE IS SHE?
WHERE'S LAURA?

40:25.234 --> 40:26.567
SHE DIED.

40:26.667 --> 40:28.701
NO.
NO, NO.

40:28.801 --> 40:31.133
THROUGH ALL THE TREACHERY AND
DOUBLE-DEALING AT THE G.S.A.,

40:31.234 --> 40:33.801
SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO
REMAINED LOYAL - LOYAL TO ME!

40:33.901 --> 40:35.300
SHE CAN'T BE DEAD!

40:35.400 --> 40:37.133
OH, YOU CARED ABOUT HER?

40:37.234 --> 40:40.300
CARED?
I LOVED HER.

40:40.400 --> 40:41.534
THAT'S TOO BAD...

40:44.767 --> 40:46.200
LOVE HURTS.

40:54.534 --> 40:57.334
GUYS...

40:57.434 --> 41:00.534
THANK YOU.

41:00.634 --> 41:02.901
I WOULDN'T BE HERE
WITHOUT YOU.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.934
NAH, IT WAS NO BIG DEAL.

41:06.667 --> 41:09.067
YEAH...

41:09.167 --> 41:11.033
YOU'RE THE REASON
I WANTED TO LIVE.

41:11.133 --> 41:13.701
THAT IS A BIG DEAL.

41:13.801 --> 41:15.267
WHAT?

41:16.901 --> 41:20.534
SO DID YOU HAVE ANY OTHER
NEAR-DEATH REVELATIONS?

41:20.634 --> 41:24.567
WELL, I DID.

41:24.667 --> 41:27.501
SEE, UH, YOU PUT US
THROUGH THAT AGAIN...

41:27.601 --> 41:28.868
I'LL KILL YOU MYSELF.

41:28.968 --> 41:31.200
<chuckles>

41:35.100 --> 41:37.434
BRENNAN...

41:37.534 --> 41:40.234
WHAT'S UP?

41:40.334 --> 41:42.634
YOU RISKED YOUR LIFE FOR ME.

41:42.734 --> 41:44.634
YOU TOOK A BULLET FOR ME.

41:44.734 --> 41:46.968
YEAH, BUT I DIDN'T
KNOW IT WOULD HURT.

41:47.067 --> 41:49.734
OH, MAN,
YOU'RE A BIG WUSS.

41:49.834 --> 41:51.501
I'M SURE YOU WOULD
HAVE DONE IT ANYWAY.

41:53.667 --> 41:55.834
ANY TIME.

41:55.934 --> 41:57.234
YEAH, I KNOW.

41:57.334 --> 41:59.133
OH... UH... UH...
