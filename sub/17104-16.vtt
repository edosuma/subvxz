TARA (VOICEOVER): Previously
on "Dance Academy--"

00:04.240 --> 00:07.599
MS. RAINE: Katrina, please
don't let us disturb you.

00:07.639 --> 00:10.199
This is Petra Hoffman, on
exchange from the Berlin Ballet

00:10.240 --> 00:11.439
School, your new roommate.

00:11.480 --> 00:12.640
-Well, good.

00:12.679 --> 00:14.160
You're both cast-- my
gorgeous, sweet Juliet

00:14.199 --> 00:17.160
and difficult, brooding
Romeo, perfect.

00:19.600 --> 00:20.679
-Careful!

00:20.719 --> 00:21.800
-You were fine!

00:21.839 --> 00:23.719
-I was about to fall
flat on my face.

00:23.760 --> 00:25.239
-Oh, when have I
ever dropped you?

00:25.280 --> 00:26.320
-Thought you guys were getting
along better these days.

00:26.359 --> 00:27.800
-It's got nothing
to do with that.

00:27.839 --> 00:28.640
Come one.

00:28.679 --> 00:30.160
-And now--

00:40.159 --> 00:41.479
-Hey, you guys should
check this out.

00:41.520 --> 00:43.600
It actually turned
out surprisingly well.

00:43.640 --> 00:45.399
-It never happened.

00:45.439 --> 00:48.479
-So you two kissed
and made up yet?

01:02.640 --> 01:06.599
THEME SONG: Take a breath.

01:06.640 --> 01:09.480
Close your eyes.

01:09.519 --> 01:14.599
Take a leap of faith and
lead the way tonight.

01:17.640 --> 01:20.079
This is my chance.

01:20.120 --> 01:24.560
This is my chance, my
chance to feel alive.

01:35.560 --> 01:36.599
It

01:36.640 --> 01:38.319
TARA (VOICEOVER):
As dancers, we learn

01:38.359 --> 01:42.200
to be in control of our bodies,
down to the last millimeter,

01:42.239 --> 01:46.120
because if even one finger
is out of the alignment.

01:46.159 --> 01:50.319
-Tara, Tara!

01:50.359 --> 01:53.239
TARA (VOICEOVER):
It all falls apart.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.640
So you practice movements
until they're perfect.

01:55.680 --> 01:58.640
You learn to control
gravity, to control pain,

01:58.680 --> 02:01.599
and refuse to let yourself
get away with anything.

02:01.640 --> 02:04.319
But there's one thing that
doesn't follow the rules,

02:04.359 --> 02:08.318
that you wish you could
control but can't-- your heart.

02:08.360 --> 02:11.120
-I want to right now
who is responsible.

02:16.439 --> 02:18.080
-No, it's too weird.

02:18.120 --> 02:20.360
-I said, let there be cake.

02:20.400 --> 02:21.319
-All right.

02:24.560 --> 02:26.520
I know, I throw like a girl.

02:26.560 --> 02:27.800
-You do.

02:27.840 --> 02:31.639
-OK, to my sister, sweet
16 and never been kissed.

02:31.680 --> 02:32.280
Hey--

02:36.319 --> 02:38.639
-What is wrong with you people?

02:38.680 --> 02:42.400
I specifically asked for you to
fulfill my one birthday wish,

02:42.439 --> 02:44.199
not for presents,
but for my world

02:44.240 --> 02:49.080
to be seen through cream and
sugar and all things cakey.

02:52.599 --> 02:54.080
Petra, I am so glad I met you.

02:54.120 --> 02:55.800
-Oh, but of course.

02:55.840 --> 02:58.319
-Hey, what'd I miss?

02:58.360 --> 03:00.159
Oh, my gosh, your birthday.

03:00.199 --> 03:02.360
-I sent you like 50 reminders
about it being here.

03:02.400 --> 03:03.120
-Oh, I know.

03:03.159 --> 03:03.719
I'm sorry.

03:03.759 --> 03:04.360
I just totally--

03:04.400 --> 03:05.319
-Spaced?

03:05.360 --> 03:08.080
It happens.

03:08.120 --> 03:09.479
-So what's the plan for tonight.

03:09.520 --> 03:10.400
Are we doing anything?

03:10.439 --> 03:11.240
-Uh, negative.

03:11.280 --> 03:14.039
The parentals are home tomorrow.

03:14.080 --> 03:16.319
And I've made Natasha
promise that she's

03:16.360 --> 03:18.039
going to cook us all
something edible.

03:18.080 --> 03:19.199
-The woman can do 64 fouettes.

03:19.240 --> 03:20.599
But give her an
oven and disaster.

03:20.639 --> 03:21.680
-It's fantastic to watch.

03:21.719 --> 03:23.039
[phone ringing]

03:23.080 --> 03:25.800
Ooh, hello we were
just talking about you.

03:25.840 --> 03:29.840
You better be
studying your recipes.

03:29.879 --> 03:31.199
-I can't believe I did that.

03:31.240 --> 03:33.159
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

03:33.199 --> 03:35.520
ETHAN: No, you've
got to be kidding me.

03:35.560 --> 03:38.719
I've seen that look before.

03:38.759 --> 03:41.800
-Fine, whatever.

03:41.840 --> 03:45.719
So Ma and Pa have
extended the tour.

03:45.759 --> 03:48.039
Estonia needs them apparently.

03:48.080 --> 03:49.319
-Oh, Kat, I'm so--

03:49.360 --> 03:50.680
-Don't be.

03:50.719 --> 03:52.680
They put a bunch of money
into my account and said,

03:52.719 --> 03:54.199
I can buy whatever I want.

03:54.240 --> 03:56.400
Thing is, I don't want presents.

03:56.439 --> 03:57.680
And there's an
empty house, which

03:57.719 --> 04:02.400
means-- off campus house
party, tell your friends.

04:02.439 --> 04:03.800
ETHAN: Yeah, not
too many friends.

04:03.840 --> 04:07.479
-Uh, he has three in
the known universe.

04:07.520 --> 04:10.120
Come on, Grandma,
just embrace the fact,

04:10.159 --> 04:12.280
that tomorrow night, we are
going to be putting on--

04:12.319 --> 04:13.520
-Oh, it's we now, is it?

04:13.560 --> 04:14.879
-Yes.

04:14.919 --> 04:18.079
We are going to be putting
on the event of the year.

04:18.120 --> 04:19.319
-All right.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.399
But you're doing all
the work, because I'm

04:20.439 --> 04:21.800
going to be hanging
out with Tara.

04:21.839 --> 04:23.439
-Huh, good luck with that.

04:23.480 --> 04:27.319
She hasn't had much time
for a lot of people lately.

04:27.360 --> 04:29.839
-Does she seem all right to you?

04:29.879 --> 04:32.800
I mean, she hasn't
said anything about me?

04:32.839 --> 04:34.319
-Yes.

04:34.360 --> 04:36.439
Uh, we discussed you in
detail, because the world

04:36.480 --> 04:37.399
revolves around you.

04:37.439 --> 04:39.399
[phone ringtone]

04:49.439 --> 04:50.600
-Good.

04:50.639 --> 04:53.399
Everyone notice Petra's
high retire position,

04:53.439 --> 04:54.319
nice and controlled.

04:59.439 --> 05:02.319
In fouette, now Tara,
not in you own time.

05:06.360 --> 05:07.680
You had this working last week.

05:07.720 --> 05:10.480
What's changed?

05:10.519 --> 05:12.759
That was a question.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.839
-I think I'm nervous
about falling.

05:14.879 --> 05:16.560
-Then you need to
trust your partner.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.800
-Maybe she needs to
trust herself first.

05:18.839 --> 05:20.240
-And what is that
supposed to mean?

05:20.279 --> 05:21.480
-You want me to say?

05:21.519 --> 05:23.040
-Uh excuse me.

05:23.079 --> 05:24.399
If there's a problem
here, it needs

05:24.439 --> 05:26.639
to be resolved
outside the studio.

05:26.680 --> 05:29.680
One day, heaven forbid,
you'll be professionals.

05:29.720 --> 05:31.199
Start acting like it.

05:49.680 --> 05:52.040
-Look, you need to stop
whatever it is you're doing.

05:52.079 --> 05:53.399
-Really?

05:53.439 --> 05:55.639
Because I'm pretty sure
you're the one who kissed me.

05:55.680 --> 05:56.839
-That was an accident.

05:56.879 --> 05:59.600
-What, your lips just
slipped, did they?

05:59.639 --> 06:03.040
-Well, it didn't mean anything.

06:03.079 --> 06:07.399
Look, I don't-- I just don't
feel that way about you.

06:10.240 --> 06:12.480
-All right then, forget it.

06:12.519 --> 06:16.639
You're not even my type.

06:16.680 --> 06:18.519
-Christian--

06:18.560 --> 06:21.279
-Yeah?

06:21.319 --> 06:22.600
-Don't say anything to anyone.

06:30.839 --> 06:32.399
[knock]

06:32.439 --> 06:35.120
PATRICK: Hey, I've heard you're
looking for a DJ for your part.

06:35.160 --> 06:37.160
I've uh scratched some
pretty big events--

06:37.199 --> 06:40.120
um parties, my grandparents'
fortieth anniversary.

06:40.160 --> 06:44.319
I could give you mate's
rates or for free, whatever.

06:48.199 --> 06:51.120
-OK, but if you mess
this up, my knee

06:51.160 --> 06:53.519
slips in the fouette turns.

06:53.560 --> 06:55.279
-Awesome.

06:55.319 --> 06:56.199
-Uh huh.

06:58.639 --> 07:01.600
-You want me to come
early and help get set up?

07:01.639 --> 07:03.199
-That would be splendid.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.399
TARA (VOICEOVER):
Ethan Karamakov,

07:12.439 --> 07:16.360
pros-- so he still smells
like Christmas, even

07:16.399 --> 07:20.120
though up close you
realize that just his soap.

07:20.160 --> 07:23.639
And what you didn't know
before is that it's not enough

07:23.680 --> 07:25.319
for him to just hold your hand.

07:25.360 --> 07:29.519
He has to wrap his
fingers around your.

07:29.560 --> 07:33.399
And then, of course,
he's smart and inspiring.

07:33.439 --> 07:35.800
-Hey, your sister is
going to want to marry me.

07:35.839 --> 07:37.639
-Welcome to the family.

07:37.680 --> 07:39.199
ETHAN: Kind to animals--

07:39.240 --> 07:40.120
-How do you feel?

07:40.160 --> 07:41.199
-Nothing.

07:41.240 --> 07:43.160
Wait, what was the question?

07:43.199 --> 07:44.680
-I was just saying,
you look tired.

07:44.720 --> 07:46.120
-Oh, yeah.

07:46.160 --> 07:47.399
It's pas de deux.

07:47.439 --> 07:49.680
I'm having trouble with
the finger fouette turns.

07:49.720 --> 07:50.639
-Don't worry.

07:50.680 --> 07:51.680
You were born to fouette.

07:55.519 --> 07:57.759
-You've all been getting
too comfortable dancing

07:57.800 --> 07:59.759
with the same partners.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.240
During your careers,
you will have

08:01.279 --> 08:03.160
to perform with
people you've just

08:03.199 --> 08:05.600
met, people you don't
particularly like.

08:05.639 --> 08:06.839
[laughing]

08:06.879 --> 08:09.480
-Am I interrupting your
social life, Katrina?

08:09.519 --> 08:10.759
-Always.

08:10.800 --> 08:14.319
MS. RAINE: Back
to the same place.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.240
-Kat, you'll get in trouble.

08:16.279 --> 08:19.800
-What-- who are you, our mother?

08:19.839 --> 08:23.120
MS. RAINE: Five,
six, seven, eight--

08:30.800 --> 08:32.720
-Don't.

08:32.759 --> 08:36.360
[laughing]

08:36.399 --> 08:38.039
-I can't imagine
why you think I want

08:38.080 --> 08:40.159
my time wasted on a Saturday.

08:40.200 --> 08:41.480
-We-- we were just--

08:41.519 --> 08:42.519
-Out!

08:42.558 --> 08:45.320
Go and injure yourself
somewhere else.

08:45.360 --> 08:45.679
Get out!

08:48.679 --> 08:50.600
[laughing]

09:00.639 --> 09:03.480
-Uh Petra and I are about
to head over now and set up.

09:03.519 --> 09:05.200
-Um I have a private
this afternoon.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.799
But I'll get there
as soon as I can.

09:06.840 --> 09:08.279
-Don't worry about it.

09:08.320 --> 09:10.080
-Kat, have I done
something wrong?

09:10.120 --> 09:11.399
It's been a full-on week.

09:11.440 --> 09:13.320
-Yeah, it's-- it's been a
full-on week for me too,

09:13.360 --> 09:16.120
just small issues like my
parents ignoring my birthday.

09:16.159 --> 09:18.480
-We should talk, tonight.

09:18.519 --> 09:20.799
-Yeah, tonight I'll
be pretty busy.

09:20.840 --> 09:22.320
-Oh, right.

09:22.360 --> 09:24.639
I'll just-- I'll
just do this class.

09:24.679 --> 09:25.600
And--

09:25.639 --> 09:26.320
-I'll just see you there.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.200
-Fouettes en pointe.

09:39.679 --> 09:41.240
If you can't do
them by yourself,

09:41.279 --> 09:44.840
how can you expect to
do them with a partner?

09:53.320 --> 09:54.360
-Meow.

09:54.399 --> 09:57.440
-Listen, you have
an inner cat-- meow.

09:57.480 --> 09:59.639
-So the fridge has
spawned jelly shots.

09:59.679 --> 10:00.639
-Oh, relax.

10:00.679 --> 10:02.360
There's barely anything in them.

10:02.399 --> 10:03.080
[door bell]

10:03.120 --> 10:04.120
-Oh um, I'll get it.

10:04.159 --> 10:05.639
Um Sammy's mom.

10:05.679 --> 10:10.120
-Hello, here is Mrs.
Karamakov's housekeeper Gerta.

10:10.159 --> 10:13.039
Yes, I'll be here all evening.

10:13.080 --> 10:16.480
Oh, yeah.

10:16.519 --> 10:18.799
Tastes funny.

10:18.840 --> 10:21.480
-Maybe they need more
time in the fridge.

10:21.519 --> 10:22.120
-Yes.

10:34.879 --> 10:36.639
-I honestly don't
understand why everyone

10:36.679 --> 10:38.600
is so obsessed with this.

10:38.639 --> 10:40.399
-Pas de deux?

10:40.440 --> 10:42.240
-Parties.

10:42.279 --> 10:43.799
I mean, what are they really?

10:43.840 --> 10:46.159
People acting cool
and hooking up.

10:46.200 --> 10:48.480
So on Monday, they can talk
about how cool they were

10:48.519 --> 10:49.440
and how they hooked up.

10:53.440 --> 10:56.200
-You've never been to a
party before, have you?

11:01.720 --> 11:08.600
[loud music]

11:08.639 --> 11:10.360
-Close friends of yours, Kat?

11:10.399 --> 11:13.080
-Oh, you wouldn't want me
being unpopular now, would you?

11:20.840 --> 11:22.399
-Sammy invited me.

11:22.440 --> 11:24.679
(SNIDELY) Awesome.

11:24.720 --> 11:27.639
-So where's Tara?

11:27.679 --> 11:30.159
-She's gonna be a
little bit late.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.679
-To her best friend's party?

11:32.720 --> 11:34.639
That's gotta hurt.

11:34.679 --> 11:36.600
-You have a gift.

11:48.720 --> 11:50.720
-Tara, you're not on your spot.

11:50.759 --> 11:51.720
Get on your leg.

11:51.759 --> 11:53.480
You're not on your leg, Tara.

11:56.720 --> 11:58.039
-I can't.

11:58.080 --> 11:59.200
-You are perfectly
capable of doing this.

11:59.240 --> 12:00.840
You're just second
guessing yourself.

12:00.879 --> 12:03.639
And neither of us are leaving
here, until you get it right.

12:28.120 --> 12:29.559
-Hey, loner.

12:29.600 --> 12:31.440
Having fun?

12:31.480 --> 12:33.639
-Not really in the
festive mood, sorry.

12:33.679 --> 12:34.480
You?

12:34.519 --> 12:35.960
-Definitely.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.799
This is a massive improvement
on dinner with the parents.

12:37.840 --> 12:40.559
-So I was told the birthday girl
had cut the cake without me.

12:40.600 --> 12:44.320
-Oh, you shouldn't
listen to such rumors.

12:48.320 --> 12:49.639
-Come one.

12:49.679 --> 12:50.559
Everyone's outside.

12:55.559 --> 12:58.279
-Go, I'm bad company anyway.

knew you brought this in here,

13:19.159 --> 13:20.159
-Is he always so uptight?

13:20.200 --> 13:20.840
-Apparently no.

13:20.879 --> 13:22.120
He's got a girlfriend.

13:25.240 --> 13:27.600
GIRL 1: Do you know
whose party this is?

13:27.639 --> 13:30.039
GIRL 2: Some ballerina chick,
wanting a rent-a-crowd.

13:47.679 --> 13:48.639
-(SIGHING) I told you.

13:48.679 --> 13:49.799
It's not working.

13:49.840 --> 13:51.120
-No.

13:51.159 --> 13:51.840
You told me you were
afraid of falling.

13:51.879 --> 13:54.639
What will happen?

13:54.679 --> 13:56.200
-I'll get hurt.

13:56.240 --> 13:59.639
-Maybe, but you've got to
get over that fear sometime.

13:59.679 --> 14:02.840
Tara, fouettes can only be
controlled up to a point.

14:02.879 --> 14:05.320
After that, you've
got to trust yourself.

14:05.360 --> 14:08.720
Stop thinking and
just turn, from here.

worried about technique.

-Yeah, well, the should be.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.200
They look ridiculous.

14:41.240 --> 14:42.799
-It's called fun.

14:42.840 --> 14:45.480
You could try it sometime.

14:45.519 --> 14:46.960
-Yeah?

14:47.000 --> 14:49.480
If it's so much fun, then why
are you just standing here?

to call the cops.

-Watch it.

15:05.840 --> 15:07.360
Look how wasted she is.

15:07.399 --> 15:09.759
-I've come to cut the cake.

15:09.799 --> 15:11.480
I like cake.

15:11.519 --> 15:12.679
-Ah, lovely.

15:12.720 --> 15:15.279
But uh you might want
to get cleaned up first.

15:54.360 --> 15:57.399
-Art project--
pretend I'm not here.

16:10.440 --> 16:11.679
Hey, guys.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.519
Want some?

16:13.559 --> 16:16.799
-Yeah, and then later, you can
inject my eyeballs with sugar.

16:16.840 --> 16:18.559
-We're fine.

16:18.600 --> 16:20.240
How many of those have you had?

16:20.279 --> 16:22.480
-Um, I'm making a rainbow.

16:22.519 --> 16:23.480
See?

-Oh, excellent.

16:24.840 --> 16:26.639
-I've never tasted
jelly like this before.

of us, Abigail?

me yet, birthday girl.

16:43.320 --> 16:45.600
We've gotta get you out
of this cakey stuff.

gotta work with me.

-We've been talking for weeks.

17:40.759 --> 17:42.440
And you and I both
know, that's not

17:42.480 --> 17:44.319
why you brought me
up to your bedroom.

-No, I should go
back downstairs.

All right?

17:55.559 --> 17:58.160
-No, I really-- I want
to go back downstairs.

17:58.200 --> 18:01.200
No, Lucas, I don't
want to do this.

18:01.240 --> 18:02.319
Are you listening?

-My friend wants you to leave.

18:12.079 --> 18:12.559
-Whatever.

-Hey, you're here.

18:46.680 --> 18:48.160
-I really need to talk to you.

18:48.200 --> 18:49.640
-Want to go outside?

18:49.680 --> 18:50.279
-Yeah.

18:53.240 --> 18:54.839
-What are you doing
drinking like that?

18:54.880 --> 18:56.599
Do you think it
makes you look cool?

18:56.640 --> 18:57.519
-No.

18:57.559 --> 18:59.480
-No, because it doesn't.

18:59.519 --> 19:01.279
It wrecks things.

19:01.319 --> 19:05.319
And that guy, did
you even like him?

19:05.359 --> 19:08.240
-Not really.

19:08.279 --> 19:13.319
I just-- I wanted for the
first time, someone to like me.

19:19.440 --> 19:21.480
lately that's been
messing with my head.

19:21.519 --> 19:23.759
And I don't think
it meant anything.

19:23.799 --> 19:27.240
But I've been
unfair to you and--

19:27.279 --> 19:29.240
-I think I know what it is.

19:29.279 --> 19:29.599
-You do?

19:29.640 --> 19:30.480
-Yes.

19:30.519 --> 19:31.799
The fouettes, right?

19:31.839 --> 19:34.039
I mean, you said, you
were having trouble.

19:34.079 --> 19:37.039
So I figured you were
scared of falling.

19:37.079 --> 19:39.480
So I got you.

-You got me a bird.

-Have some water.

19:43.079 --> 19:44.359
I'll go get Ethan.

19:44.400 --> 19:44.880
-No, don't.

19:44.920 --> 19:47.200
He'll freak out.

19:47.240 --> 19:51.640
He's probably with Tara
anyway, because she's perfect.

19:51.680 --> 19:53.440
And he's perfect.

19:53.480 --> 19:57.640
And perfect people
attract each other.

19:57.680 --> 20:01.559
I'm seriously not perfect.

20:01.599 --> 20:03.440
-Don't worry.

20:03.480 --> 20:05.720
I'm not perfect either.

20:05.759 --> 20:08.440
-Nope.

20:08.480 --> 20:12.519
I always thought you and I were
the same-- seriously unperfect.

20:21.559 --> 20:24.079
-You don't like it?

20:24.119 --> 20:26.160
-It's perfect, but--

20:26.200 --> 20:30.200
-Couldn't have predicted
that-- my sister hand bulls

20:30.240 --> 20:33.640
all the work, so she can be free
to go in for the birthday pash.

20:33.680 --> 20:35.599
Did not need to see that.

20:35.640 --> 20:36.799
-Yeah, I'm not a Lucas fan.

20:36.839 --> 20:38.039
She could do so much better.

20:38.079 --> 20:38.640
-I think she is.

20:38.680 --> 20:39.279
Check it out.

-What?

20:51.440 --> 20:52.119
-I'm sorry, mate.

-What just happened.

20:59.519 --> 21:00.839
Did I miss something?

21:00.880 --> 21:03.720
-I don't know.

21:03.759 --> 21:04.640
-I'll call her.

I'm so sorry.

-Bad night?

you to get lost.

listening to ballet boys.

-Well.

something in the jelly?

do I need to remind you

Academy of Dance?

now who was responsible.

way is up anymore.
