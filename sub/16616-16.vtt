00:01.543 --> 00:04.963
<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

00:05.047 --> 00:08.175
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:08.258 --> 00:11.845
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>good old-fashioned values</i>

00:11.929 --> 00:14.389
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:14.932 --> 00:17.726
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:18.268 --> 00:21.480
<i>Lucky there's a man who</i>
<i>positively can do</i>

00:21.772 --> 00:23.232
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:23.398 --> 00:24.900
<i>Laugh and cry</i>

00:24.983 --> 00:30.113
<i>He's a family guy</i>

00:36.620 --> 00:39.164
<i>Is Netflix Streaming</i>
<i>the right choice for you?</i>

00:39.248 --> 00:43.210
<i>Well, if you like movies in HD,</i>
<i>then frozen pixels, then HD again,</i>

00:43.293 --> 00:45.003
<i>the answer is, "Yes."</i>

00:45.295 --> 00:48.382
<i>And if you love the golden year</i>
<i>of movies, 2003,</i>

00:48.465 --> 00:50.801
<i>then we might have</i>
<i>some of what you're looking for.</i>

00:50.884 --> 00:53.011
<i>Netflix Streaming. Buffer for 20 minutes,</i>

00:53.095 --> 00:56.265
<i>then watch 35 minutes of a movie</i>
<i>with Jason Statham.</i>

00:57.182 --> 01:00.936
Ah! Look what came.
The free DVD from my PBS pledge.

01:01.019 --> 01:02.479
Whatever it is, we're not watching it.

01:02.563 --> 01:06.066
Peter, trust me, you of all people
could really learn something from this.

01:06.149 --> 01:10.237
It's a documentary about the food industry
called <i>Food Kills.</i>

01:10.320 --> 01:14.157
Huh. Says here that <i>Colon Health Magazine</i>
gave it two thumbs in.

01:21.832 --> 01:24.710
Hi, I'm Matt Lauer's cousin,
Steven McCormick.

01:24.793 --> 01:26.170
Our moms are sisters.

01:26.253 --> 01:28.088
America is gorging itself on
processed food,

01:28.172 --> 01:30.716
creating an obesity epidemic.

01:30.799 --> 01:32.259
We've abandoned natural foods

01:32.342 --> 01:34.636
for chemicals, additives
and refined sugars.

01:34.720 --> 01:37.639
At this rate, this is what the future
will look like.

01:38.182 --> 01:39.516
<i>Those are flying cars.</i>

01:39.600 --> 01:41.894
<i>But the people in them are too fat.</i>

01:41.977 --> 01:44.396
Oh, no, I left my baby in there!

01:44.813 --> 01:46.648
Without drastic changes in our diet,

01:46.732 --> 01:49.109
Americans are headed
for a health catastrophe.

01:49.193 --> 01:54.448
For more, go to our website
at www.pbs.com.

01:54.531 --> 01:58.535
That's "www dot" the word
"double-u" three times,

01:58.619 --> 02:02.080
the word "dot," "PBS,"
the word "dot" again,

02:02.164 --> 02:04.041
the word "com," dot com.

02:04.333 --> 02:07.211
There was a miscommunication
when we registered our website.

02:07.628 --> 02:10.797
Well, that's it. From now on,
we're eating healthy around here.

02:10.881 --> 02:12.925
We're gonna feel better
and we're gonna look better.

02:13.008 --> 02:15.511
Well, looking better didn't always
solve your problems, Lois.

02:15.594 --> 02:18.388
Sure didn't work for Droopy Dog
when he got that face-lift.

02:18.597 --> 02:22.476
Contrary to my appearance,
I'm still not happy.

02:22.559 --> 02:27.481
Please, study my brain so that others
don't suffer as I have.

02:38.909 --> 02:41.036
Thanks for coming
to my birthday party, you guys.

02:41.119 --> 02:44.831
And, Esther, I'm so sorry you ripped
your perineum doing the Hokey Pokey.

02:44.915 --> 02:47.000
That's okay. I got free curly fries.

02:47.084 --> 02:49.086
Okay, let's see what Meg got me.

02:49.503 --> 02:50.963
A Crock-Pot?

02:51.046 --> 02:53.632
Things about to get crazy!

02:53.715 --> 02:56.385
You can cook a pork tenderloin
under your bed.

02:56.677 --> 02:57.678
Excuse me, girls.

02:57.761 --> 02:59.721
We're about to start
roller derby in a minute.

03:00.806 --> 03:02.015
Wait, wait, you.

03:02.099 --> 03:03.475
- What's your name?
- Me?

03:03.559 --> 03:05.936
- Meg Griffin.
- Would you mind standing up?

03:06.979 --> 03:09.022
Whoa!
What are you doing?

03:09.106 --> 03:12.568
- My God. The magic ratio.
- What's that?

03:12.651 --> 03:16.113
It means your ankles, calves and thighs
are all the same thickness.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.198
How would you like to try out
for the roller derby team?

03:18.282 --> 03:19.324
Really?

03:19.408 --> 03:21.660
- Do it, Meg.
- Yeah, Meg, you should totally do it.

03:21.743 --> 03:23.245
Meg's talking to a boy!

03:23.537 --> 03:25.706
Okay. Sure. What the heck?

03:25.789 --> 03:27.416
Here, take my card.

03:27.499 --> 03:31.086
-"I am a registered sex offender."
- Flip it over.

03:31.170 --> 03:34.047
-"Important, see other side."
- Give me that.

03:34.131 --> 03:36.633
I'm the roller derby coach.
See you at tryouts.

03:37.467 --> 03:38.886
I can't believe it, you guys.

03:38.969 --> 03:42.556
This is the biggest surprise since
the last M. Night Shyamalan movie.

03:42.639 --> 03:45.184
Two tickets for the
M. Night Shyamalan movie.

03:45.267 --> 03:46.977
Wow. Really?

03:52.107 --> 03:54.401
Hope you guys are ready
for a healthy dinner.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.737
I went to Whole Foods today
and got this recipe

03:56.820 --> 03:59.990
from an extremely thin man
with a giant Adam's apple.

04:00.282 --> 04:04.077
I hate that place.
None of the cereals are advertised on TV.

04:04.161 --> 04:07.289
- What's this stuff that looks like sand?
- It's quinoa.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.917
Nope, I don't eat foods
that sound like karate words.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.670
Well, according to <i>Food Kills,</i>
quinoa is a superfood.

04:13.754 --> 04:16.673
It's very nutritious,
and it even helps keep you regular.

04:16.757 --> 04:20.177
Lois, I have a system.
I poop once a week for an hour and a half.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.930
I wear a headband and it's soaked
when I'm all done.

04:23.639 --> 04:26.725
Mmm. Wow, Lois, you know,
this is actually pretty good.

04:26.808 --> 04:29.102
- Peter, you should try it.
- Ugh, fine.

04:37.194 --> 04:38.612
Peter, knock it off.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.740
I can't help it. My body's rejecting it.

04:43.033 --> 04:45.035
- Name?
- Quinoa.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.621
Mmm-hmm. Sorry, sir, we're full.

04:48.330 --> 04:49.998
Come on in, Gummy Bears.

04:50.082 --> 04:52.793
Oh, you are looking fine tonight.

04:52.876 --> 04:53.877
Mmm!

04:59.550 --> 05:01.844
Thanks again for coming
and supporting me, Chris.

05:01.927 --> 05:02.970
No problem.

05:03.053 --> 05:06.473
And I'm gonna take some pictures
of the other athletes, if you don't mind.

05:06.557 --> 05:10.185
You might not know this about me,
but I am a bit of a shutterbug.

05:10.269 --> 05:12.980
Okay, that's... That's all okay.

05:13.272 --> 05:15.232
All right, ladies, line up.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.402
How about we start with some warm-ups?

05:18.485 --> 05:20.195
Bend down and touch your toes.

05:22.072 --> 05:24.867
Memory card full? Come on!

05:25.242 --> 05:29.705
Okay, now, last year we were tricked
by a couch on a dolly with wheels.

05:29.788 --> 05:32.374
So, if any of you is a couch
on a dolly with wheels,

05:32.457 --> 05:34.418
I'm gonna ask you to please leave now.

05:37.379 --> 05:40.299
Well, we need five for a team,
and there's five of you here.

05:40.382 --> 05:42.092
So, congratulations.

05:42.176 --> 05:43.886
Wow! This is awesome!

05:43.969 --> 05:45.846
I can't believe I'm a Quahog Thug.

05:45.929 --> 05:47.389
When do we start skating?

05:47.472 --> 05:49.099
Here, look at the schedule.

05:49.183 --> 05:51.685
This is just a list
of Sexaholic Anonymous meetings.

05:51.768 --> 05:52.853
Flip it over.

05:52.936 --> 05:55.314
It says,
"Remember to attend your meetings."

05:55.439 --> 05:57.149
I'm gonna stop handing you stuff.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.659
It's the middle of the night.
Where are you going?

06:07.743 --> 06:09.119
I'm sick of all this healthy crap.

06:09.203 --> 06:11.663
I'm going downstairs
to find something good to eat.

06:11.747 --> 06:16.001
And then I'm gonna fall asleep watching
transvaginal mesh lawsuit commercials.

06:18.962 --> 06:21.340
- There's nothing.
- Thank you, son.

06:29.431 --> 06:31.350
What's going on, man? Are you pregnant?

06:31.433 --> 06:33.852
No, my wife watched
that food documentary.

06:33.936 --> 06:36.980
And you should never ask that
unless you're sure, by the way.

06:41.151 --> 06:42.152
Oh, yeah.

06:42.236 --> 06:45.030
Peanut-butter-cup-
Dorito-sausage-car panini.

06:45.113 --> 06:47.741
And let's crack a Cadbury Egg
over the whole thing.

06:48.325 --> 06:51.578
I'm just gonna use my spare
glove compartment underwear as a napkin.

06:51.954 --> 06:55.123
I can't believe Randy Quaid gets
to eat like this every day.

06:56.458 --> 06:58.502
- Peter, is that you?
- Cleveland?

06:58.585 --> 07:01.171
- Are you cooking in your car?
- I am.

07:02.840 --> 07:06.218
- Is this because of <i>Food Kills?</i>
- Oh, you saw that movie too, huh?

07:06.301 --> 07:09.513
We watched Tyler Perry's <i>Food Kills,</i>
which is the same movie

07:09.596 --> 07:12.099
except it stars black folks
you've never heard of

07:12.182 --> 07:14.518
and white folks
you don't hear from anymore.

07:14.601 --> 07:17.771
But, yeah, now Donna is forcing me
to eat healthy.

07:17.855 --> 07:20.941
I always get confused.
Is Donna the wife or is Roberta the wife?

07:21.024 --> 07:23.694
I don't know, man.
Can I have some of that sandwich?

07:25.737 --> 07:28.156
Oh, our hands just touched.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.785
Mmm. Wow, Peter, that's good.

07:31.869 --> 07:33.245
That's real good.

07:34.162 --> 07:36.832
- I'm not sure what we're doing now.
- Excuse me.

07:36.915 --> 07:39.042
Whatever you've got in there
smells incredible.

07:39.126 --> 07:41.795
Man, my wife won't let me eat
any of that stuff.

07:41.879 --> 07:44.173
Tell you what, I'll give you
10 bucks for that thing.

07:44.256 --> 07:46.466
- Yeah, me too.
- Wow.

07:46.550 --> 07:51.388
Huh. If I sell two sandwiches
for $10 each, that equals...

07:56.310 --> 07:57.477
Money.

08:01.023 --> 08:04.151
Peter, you just made $20
from two sandwiches.

08:04.234 --> 08:05.485
Wow, you're right.

08:05.569 --> 08:07.404
Hey, maybe I can
turn this into a business.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.281
You know, selling sandwiches
from a car.

08:09.531 --> 08:11.033
Wonder how much I could make.

08:14.745 --> 08:16.872
<i>Mad world...</i>

08:17.456 --> 08:20.709
Whoops, I stopped thinking about math
and started thinking about baby-man

08:20.792 --> 08:23.212
Billy Corgan being sad at Disneyland.

08:33.472 --> 08:37.184
- Peter, what the hell is this?
- This, Lois, is my new food truck.

08:37.267 --> 08:41.188
Specializing in all the delicious,
unhealthy foods that you won't let me eat.

08:41.271 --> 08:43.524
'Cause you don't let me eat
what I wanna eat.

08:43.607 --> 08:46.151
And... I am super dizzy.

08:46.235 --> 08:48.612
And there might be
a gas leak in this thing.

08:57.746 --> 08:59.790
I can't believe
you'd buy a food truck.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.208
What are you even selling?

09:01.291 --> 09:03.043
First of all, believe it, baby.

09:03.126 --> 09:06.922
Second, uh, mostly hamburgers
where the buns is jelly donuts.

09:07.005 --> 09:09.675
And drinks where hot dogs
is the straws.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.387
Mmm. Another milkshake, please.

09:13.470 --> 09:16.849
Look, I'm happy for the business,
but drinking that on your knees is...

09:16.932 --> 09:18.767
It's putting a hat on a hat.

09:18.851 --> 09:21.395
Look at this food.
It's gross and unhealthy.

09:21.478 --> 09:24.565
It's exactly the stuff I'm trying
to get you not to eat.

09:24.648 --> 09:26.900
Yeah, but people like this food.
It makes them happy.

09:26.984 --> 09:30.070
I mean, you can eat sprouts
and vegan crap your entire life

09:30.153 --> 09:33.031
and still get devoured by gremlins
and none of it matters.

09:33.115 --> 09:35.284
So, you're saying
you shouldn't take care of yourself

09:35.367 --> 09:37.578
because you might get devoured
by gremlins?

09:37.661 --> 09:39.246
Get a clue, Mama.

09:39.329 --> 09:41.707
Think of what you're doing
to your body, Peter.

09:41.790 --> 09:43.083
Oh, there we go.

09:43.166 --> 09:46.044
- You think I'm overweight?
- I know you're overweight.

09:46.545 --> 09:48.964
Hey, I'll have the Swedish fish taco.

09:49.047 --> 09:51.633
You want the can of chili
dumped on top or on the side?

09:51.717 --> 09:53.135
What does the chef recommend?

09:53.218 --> 09:55.762
Me? I like to squeeze the can so hard,

09:55.846 --> 09:57.764
the chili flies into my mouth like Popeye.

09:57.848 --> 09:58.932
Do it up.

09:59.016 --> 10:00.767
You got it!
Let me put on my bandanna,

10:00.851 --> 10:03.937
fire up my very loud watt generator
and get cookin'.

10:06.899 --> 10:09.151
- Peter, this isn't over.
- What?

10:17.326 --> 10:20.454
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome</i>
<i>to the first bout of the season.</i>

10:20.537 --> 10:24.082
<i>The Quahog Thugs versus</i>
<i>the Medford Dump Cakes.</i>

10:24.166 --> 10:27.377
<i>This season, we're brought to you by</i>
<i>Berries note cards.</i>

10:27.461 --> 10:29.838
<i>When you need to remind yourself</i>
<i>of the sponsor,</i>

10:29.922 --> 10:32.090
<i>use Berries note cards.</i>

10:49.399 --> 10:50.817
Nice move, Griffin.

10:51.527 --> 10:53.070
Way to go, Meg!

10:53.487 --> 10:56.240
<i>Wow! Newcomer</i>
<i>Meg Griffin is lighting up the track</i>

10:56.323 --> 10:57.866
<i>with some amazing moves.</i>

10:57.950 --> 11:00.786
"Amazing"? Damn right, amazing.

11:03.247 --> 11:04.831
<i>Make some noise if you're mixing</i>

11:04.915 --> 11:07.668
<i>prescription drugs with alcohol!</i>

11:09.795 --> 11:12.339
Wow. This is a lot more physical
than I thought.

11:12.422 --> 11:15.551
My favorite part
of a woman's body is haunches.

11:15.634 --> 11:18.178
And this is all haunch, baby.

11:19.888 --> 11:21.765
- Meg!

11:24.059 --> 11:25.477
Boy, that was rough.

11:25.561 --> 11:28.272
This sport is even more dangerous
than skeet shooting.

11:28.772 --> 11:29.815
Pull!

11:29.898 --> 11:31.441
I got in the wrong line!

11:36.697 --> 11:38.031
That'll be $16.

11:38.115 --> 11:40.242
Sixteen dollars?
That's expensive.

11:40.325 --> 11:41.869
Yes, sir, everything is very expensive

11:41.952 --> 11:43.871
because you're paying
for it on an iPad.

11:43.954 --> 11:45.581
Now, if you'll just select a gratuity.

11:45.664 --> 11:48.876
Options are 60%, 90% and 200%.

11:48.959 --> 11:51.044
Uh, I guess 60%?

11:51.128 --> 11:54.047
Okay, great, and just sign
by dragging your bare finger

11:54.131 --> 11:56.008
across this thing I use to masturbate.

11:56.091 --> 11:57.551
Uh, okay.

11:57.968 --> 12:00.971
Thank you. Please make sure to bang
your head on that low hanging thing.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.055
What are you...

12:02.139 --> 12:03.724
Oh, you spilled something.
You want a napkin?

12:03.807 --> 12:04.850
Yes, please.

12:04.975 --> 12:06.977
All right, here's 40
blown by the wind.

12:14.359 --> 12:17.529
Oh, Chris, I'm glad you're here.
Swing that lamp at me.

12:17.613 --> 12:18.864
But you'll get hurt.

12:18.947 --> 12:21.074
No, I won't.
I'm gonna dodge it.

12:23.243 --> 12:26.580
- Oh, my God! Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

12:26.830 --> 12:28.999
This roller derby
has really toughened me up.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.460
I gotta say, I've never felt better.

12:31.543 --> 12:34.588
Really? 'Cause I watched how rough
it was out there the other day

12:34.671 --> 12:36.673
and I got a little worried for you.

12:36.757 --> 12:40.219
I mean, all it would take is
one bad hit to do permanent damage.

12:40.302 --> 12:43.472
- I think you should quit.
- What? No.

12:43.555 --> 12:45.599
No, I love roller derby.

12:45.682 --> 12:48.185
It's the first thing
I'm really good at.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.771
Plus, I love making
other women bleed.

12:50.854 --> 12:53.398
You know,
in ways besides the way...

12:53.482 --> 12:55.192
You know,
they normally bleed.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.361
- She means periods.
- Yeah, I got it, Stewie.

12:57.444 --> 13:00.030
But I'm telling you, Meg,
something bad is going to happen.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.699
Like, when you give a young athlete
too much money.

13:03.784 --> 13:05.702
Uh... I gotta murder somebody.

13:11.083 --> 13:13.252
Peter, kids, dinner.

13:15.212 --> 13:16.755
Kids? Peter?

13:16.839 --> 13:19.424
It's time for a healthy veggie dinner.

13:19.508 --> 13:23.136
Come on, I spent the whole day
making the house smell like farts.

13:23.220 --> 13:24.763
Where the hell is everybody?

13:28.559 --> 13:31.645
All right, I got a bowl of cereal.
That's M&M's and Dr. Pepper.

13:31.728 --> 13:32.729
Over here.

13:33.647 --> 13:34.731
Chris, put that down.

13:34.815 --> 13:37.985
You kids get in the house
and eat the healthy dinner I prepared.

13:38.068 --> 13:41.405
And Peter, you too.
Shut down that truck and get inside.

13:41.488 --> 13:44.116
Lois, I already told you
I don't wanna eat your garbage food.

13:44.199 --> 13:46.326
All right? Now can you go inside
and get me some Pop Rocks?

13:46.410 --> 13:47.494
I'm making a paella.

13:47.578 --> 13:49.830
You know what?
Enough of this nonsense.

13:49.913 --> 13:52.082
You love this truck so much,
stay in it!

13:52.165 --> 13:54.543
'Cause I don't want you
or your food in the house.

13:54.626 --> 13:55.919
Fine! I love this truck.

13:56.003 --> 13:57.671
I got everything I need in here.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.673
Maybe I'll just live here.

13:59.756 --> 14:01.341
I can imagine it now.

14:06.638 --> 14:07.723
Whoops.

14:07.806 --> 14:10.851
I stopped thinking about the truck and
started thinking about Amazon woman

14:10.934 --> 14:13.395
Brigitte Nielsen
drunk in a Burbank park.

14:36.710 --> 14:38.754
All right,
time to greet the day.

14:40.172 --> 14:41.757
Are you living in a truck?

14:42.466 --> 14:44.718
Not bad. I see you got
a Hooters calendar in here.

14:44.801 --> 14:48.180
How do you get anything done with
those rockin' knockers staring at ya?

14:48.263 --> 14:49.890
Hey, who says I get anything done?

14:49.973 --> 14:51.892
Heh. Guy talk, guy talk, eh. Guy talk.

14:51.975 --> 14:54.061
- Guy talk, guy talk.
- This is how guys talk.

14:54.144 --> 14:56.647
- Oh, Peter, this is awful.
- Well, I love it.

14:56.730 --> 14:58.774
And I'm not going back in that house
and listen to Lois

14:58.857 --> 15:00.609
tell me how fat and unhealthy I am.

15:00.692 --> 15:02.402
You do look like you put on a few.

15:02.486 --> 15:04.112
Your elbows are starting to pucker.

15:04.196 --> 15:06.114
Yeah, I mean,
are you really happy in here?

15:06.198 --> 15:09.493
You bet I am. I'm happier
than a squash on Halloween.

15:11.245 --> 15:13.872
Dad, are they coming
to take us away too?

15:13.956 --> 15:15.582
No, son, we're fine.

15:15.666 --> 15:17.376
How about on Thanksgiving?

15:17.459 --> 15:19.336
You know what?
Just enjoy the month.

15:32.349 --> 15:33.767
You're going down, Griffin.

15:33.851 --> 15:35.894
Like my stepfather's pants.

15:35.978 --> 15:38.313
I guess I see where
some of your anger comes from.

15:40.858 --> 15:42.276
Oh, no, this is bad.

15:48.073 --> 15:50.200
That's it! I have to do something.

15:51.326 --> 15:52.619
Chris, what are you doing?

15:52.703 --> 15:53.912
Saving my...

15:57.749 --> 15:59.960
Oh, my God!
Chris, are you okay?

16:00.043 --> 16:02.546
I don't think so.
I'm hurt pretty bad.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.548
Like that time
I was running with scissors.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.219
You run like a girl.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.309
Run like a man,
you get a suit.

16:19.104 --> 16:22.107
There you go. And if you'd like
to put your email on our sign-up list,

16:22.191 --> 16:24.484
I'd be happy to sell it
to Russian hackers.

16:24.568 --> 16:26.153
Peter! Peter, it's happening.

16:26.236 --> 16:28.071
- What?
- The Bing maps car.

16:28.155 --> 16:30.365
It's three blocks down,
and it's coming this way.

16:30.449 --> 16:32.826
Holy crap! This is the day
we've been waiting for.

16:32.910 --> 16:34.536
We said we're gonna stand
in our front yards

16:34.620 --> 16:37.331
and wave as it goes by
so we're on the street view.

16:37.414 --> 16:39.208
We're gonna be on the Internet.

16:39.291 --> 16:41.460
Mort just called.
It went by his house.

16:41.543 --> 16:43.837
Everybody, places. Start waving.

16:43.921 --> 16:45.756
This is not a drill.

16:50.093 --> 16:52.179
Damn it!
I can't fit through the door.

16:52.262 --> 16:53.514
I'm stuck in a truck.

16:53.597 --> 16:55.182
What? What are you talking about?

16:55.265 --> 16:58.352
I knew this would happen.
You're too fat to get out.

16:58.435 --> 17:00.187
I see it! I see the Bing car.

17:02.439 --> 17:05.359
Oh, my God, Bing!
Bing! Over here, Bing.

17:05.442 --> 17:07.819
They can't see you, Peter.
You're facing away from the street.

17:07.903 --> 17:10.197
Stop talking, Quagmire, just smile.

17:13.283 --> 17:15.035
This is amazing.

17:15.118 --> 17:16.578
Crap, is it gone?

17:16.662 --> 17:18.747
The driver nodded at me.

17:18.830 --> 17:21.500
I... I think I'm gonna cry.

17:21.583 --> 17:23.627
Damn it!
Can't believe I missed it.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.922
Jeez, I hope I don't end up
stuck in here like Winnie the Pooh.

17:27.005 --> 17:28.465
Uh, Rabbit?

17:28.966 --> 17:31.385
Perhaps you should push
with your shoulder

17:31.468 --> 17:33.762
- and not your fist?
- Don't worry about it.

17:39.476 --> 17:41.895
Hey, did that big boomba-boomba nurse
come in here?

17:41.979 --> 17:43.021
Uh, no.

17:43.105 --> 17:45.482
But Dr. Hartman,
is my brother gonna be okay?

17:46.692 --> 17:47.734
That's her, that's her.

17:47.818 --> 17:49.903
- Hello, Anita.
- Hello, Doctor.

17:51.238 --> 17:52.781
Was that weird?
Was I just weird?

17:52.865 --> 17:54.950
- Kind of.
- You don't know, I was fine.

17:56.159 --> 17:59.037
Oh, Chris, I'm so sorry
you got hurt like this.

17:59.121 --> 18:01.707
Roller derby was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

18:01.790 --> 18:05.085
I finally felt like I was good
at something, I made friends.

18:05.169 --> 18:07.754
But seeing you like this,
I realize you were right.

18:07.838 --> 18:11.675
It's too dangerous.
So, I'm going to quit.

18:11.758 --> 18:12.759
No, Meg.

18:12.843 --> 18:15.637
I got hurt because
I didn't belong out there,

18:15.721 --> 18:16.889
but you do.

18:16.972 --> 18:18.432
I watched you skate.

18:18.515 --> 18:21.185
You found your calling
and I believe in you.

18:21.268 --> 18:23.687
Now get back to that ring
and help your team win

18:23.770 --> 18:25.522
the championship it deserves.

18:25.814 --> 18:27.774
Really? I will.

18:27.858 --> 18:28.984
Thanks, Chris.

18:30.194 --> 18:32.487
<i>With the spirit in her heart renewed,</i>

18:32.571 --> 18:35.616
<i>Meg returned</i>
<i>to the roller derby arena.</i>

18:35.699 --> 18:39.536
<i>I think she did all right.</i>
<i>But no one will know for sure.</i>

18:39.620 --> 18:43.790
<i>Because halfway through,</i>
<i>everyone stopped to watch some fat kid</i>

18:43.874 --> 18:46.960
<i>who was killing it</i>
<i>on Dance-Dance Revolution.</i>

18:47.211 --> 18:50.923
<i>Dance, you fat bitch.</i>

18:54.593 --> 18:57.387
<i>So, tonight we say,</i>
<i>to the yellow build marsh finch,</i>

18:57.471 --> 18:58.931
<i>"You're extinct!"</i>

18:59.306 --> 19:01.475
<i>But right now, we're getting word</i>
<i>of breaking news.</i>

19:01.558 --> 19:03.644
<i>We go live to Tricia Takanawa</i>
<i>with details.</i>

19:03.727 --> 19:04.728
<i>Tricia?</i>

19:04.895 --> 19:08.524
Tom, I'm standing here outside
a Spooner Street home

19:08.607 --> 19:12.110
where a local business owner
has apparently eaten himself

19:12.194 --> 19:14.029
into his own food truck.

19:14.112 --> 19:17.908
Oh, it appears they have finally
removed the roof.

19:18.200 --> 19:21.245
Nobody look,
this is a private gross matter.

19:21.995 --> 19:25.332
Mr. Griffin, is this performance art

19:25.415 --> 19:28.043
or some sort of political statement?

19:28.126 --> 19:31.630
Well, I'm kind of ticked about condoms
and porn, but this is unrelated.

19:32.714 --> 19:35.425
Oh, hey, Lois.
I guess, you must be happy.

19:35.509 --> 19:38.095
Yeah, it's every girl's dream
to have her husband hoisted

19:38.178 --> 19:40.264
out of a food truck
in a horse harness.

19:40.347 --> 19:41.807
No, look, I'm just saying...

19:42.641 --> 19:43.892
You were right.

19:43.976 --> 19:47.646
I'm a big tub of lard and you have
every reason to be ashamed of me.

19:47.938 --> 19:51.233
Ashamed of you?
Is that really what you think?

19:51.316 --> 19:53.652
Well, yeah, you kept saying
how overweight I am.

19:53.735 --> 19:55.279
Peter, don't you get it?

19:55.362 --> 19:58.365
I only wanted you to eat healthy
because I love you,

19:58.448 --> 20:00.576
and I'm concerned about your health.

20:00.659 --> 20:03.954
I want you around
for as long as I'm around.

20:04.329 --> 20:05.330
Really?

20:05.414 --> 20:07.040
I love you too, Lois.

20:07.124 --> 20:09.543
I'm sorry I was such a jerk.

20:09.626 --> 20:12.379
I guess I could do
without eating so much junk.

20:12.462 --> 20:14.423
But I could never do without you.

20:15.299 --> 20:16.800
Oh, Peter...

20:18.177 --> 20:21.305
Ma'am, please step back.
We have to wash him with a hose.

20:24.433 --> 20:26.310
Guys, look, look,
the Bing car is back.

20:26.393 --> 20:28.145
No, I'm not ready.
I'm not ready!

20:31.690 --> 20:34.151
<i>Inspired by his love for Lois,</i>

20:34.234 --> 20:38.030
<i>Peter had steamed vegetables</i>
<i>and brown rice that evening,</i>

20:38.322 --> 20:41.491
<i>then ate like crap</i>
<i>for the rest of his life.</i>

20:41.825 --> 20:45.329
<i>Nonetheless, he was immortalized</i>
<i>on Bing maps.</i>

20:45.829 --> 20:49.583
<i>Fat people are amusing to me.</i>

20:49.958 --> 20:52.169
<i>Hang there, you fat bitch.</i>
