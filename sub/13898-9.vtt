00:05.500 --> 00:07.840
[applause]
Woo! Woo!

00:08.880 --> 00:09.960
[Leslie] Justin is twenty one...

00:10.010 --> 00:11.170
I remember
when it looked like

00:11.220 --> 00:12.130
she wouldn't
get through high school.

00:12.170 --> 00:13.130
Let alone this.

00:13.180 --> 00:14.840
They grows up some fast,
wha?

00:14.890 --> 00:16.140
Yeah.
They sure do.

00:16.180 --> 00:18.350
She was top of the class.

00:18.390 --> 00:19.890
So was Jake, wasn't he?

00:19.930 --> 00:23.020
I was hoping you wouldn't make
that particular comparison.

00:24.100 --> 00:25.690
Where is your famous son,
anyway?

00:25.730 --> 00:27.360
[Malachy] Remind me,
for his next birthday,

00:27.400 --> 00:28.520
we're buying Jake a clock.

00:28.570 --> 00:29.900
And a watch.

00:29.940 --> 00:31.530
Oooh. A clock-watch?
I'll go in on that.

00:31.570 --> 00:34.200
Something must be going on.
Jake would never miss this.

00:38.950 --> 00:40.040
[hockey mask man]
No, no, no, no.

00:40.080 --> 00:41.290
What's he doing?

00:41.330 --> 00:42.750
This is not part
of the boss's plan.

00:42.790 --> 00:44.670
What are you doing?
What is he doing?

00:44.710 --> 00:46.080
[black kerchief man]
He's a private investigator.

00:46.130 --> 00:47.630
He can identify us, okay?

00:47.670 --> 00:49.840
You stop this.
We need to keep our cool here.

00:49.880 --> 00:51.250
She's right, man.
This has gone too far.

00:51.300 --> 00:54.220
Listen to your friends.
You're in way too deep.

00:56.050 --> 00:57.510
[Leslie] Katrina--

00:57.550 --> 00:59.010
Tinny Doyle.

00:59.060 --> 01:02.390
Wooo!

01:02.430 --> 01:04.060
[Leslie] Tinny's from St. John's.

01:04.100 --> 01:05.390
She's named on the Dean's list.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.190
And enrolled
in a Bachelor of Arts,

01:07.230 --> 01:08.900
with a major in Police Studies.

01:17.950 --> 01:19.700
Congratulations Constable.

01:20.410 --> 01:21.950
Thank you, Sergeant.

01:24.040 --> 01:25.410
[Malachy]
You did good, kid.

01:25.460 --> 01:27.420
Yeah. We all did.

01:28.330 --> 01:30.250
She's, um,
something else.

01:30.290 --> 01:31.800
Despite the genealogy.

01:31.840 --> 01:33.710
No matter what.
Tinny is a Doyle.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.300
No one can take that from her.

01:35.800 --> 01:37.010
Yeah.

01:37.050 --> 01:38.640
That's what I'm talking about.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.720
Tinny might have to make
her first arrest this evening.

01:42.760 --> 01:45.390
'Cause when I get home,
I'm gonna behead Jake.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.560
[Jake] Think about it, okay.

01:48.600 --> 01:50.570
If what you're thinking about
doing is murder,

01:51.770 --> 01:52.780
there's no mulligans,

01:52.820 --> 01:53.150
when it comes
to killing someone.

01:54.440 --> 01:55.650
[kerchief man]
Time to shut you up for good.

01:55.700 --> 01:56.610

01:56.650 --> 01:57.490
[hockey mask man]
Wallace! Stop!

01:58.160 --> 01:59.410
Just take it easy.

02:01.120 --> 02:02.330
Wallace?

02:02.370 --> 02:03.200
That's a nice name.

02:04.160 --> 02:05.710
So what do you think,
Wallace?

02:05.750 --> 02:07.160
Is it murder?

02:07.210 --> 02:09.540
Or do all of us just want
to forget this ever happened

02:09.580 --> 02:10.500
And we go home.

02:10.540 --> 02:11.630
What do you think?

02:11.670 --> 02:12.590
[Wallace]
You said my name.

02:12.630 --> 02:13.550
[hockey mask man]
I'm sorry man.

02:13.590 --> 02:14.550
It was an accident,
Wallace.

02:14.590 --> 02:16.010
[Wallace]
You said my name again.

02:16.050 --> 02:18.010
Now he can identify us
to the cops.

02:18.050 --> 02:19.680
Now I gotta go
and kill him, okay?

02:19.720 --> 02:20.890
And it's gonna be on you.

02:20.930 --> 02:22.140
[hockey mask man]
We can't kill anyone.

02:22.890 --> 02:23.810
The boss will be pissed.

02:23.850 --> 02:24.770
He's expecting us.

02:24.810 --> 02:26.230
Let's just leave him.

02:27.770 --> 02:29.060
What's it gonna be,
Wallace?

02:30.230 --> 02:31.310
Don't let him rattle you.

02:31.360 --> 02:32.770
Hey! Hey!

02:33.860 --> 02:34.820
Stop.

02:34.860 --> 02:35.820
[Wallace]
I'm not rattled.

02:35.860 --> 02:37.150
Don't you worry.

02:48.120 --> 02:49.790
I hope you like the heat.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.840
Get off me.

02:57.380 --> 02:59.420
Sorry man.
I really am.

02:59.470 --> 03:02.300
Not as sorry as you're gonna be
when I get out of here.

But I know
that he wanted to be here.

So I bet you he's just--
on fire somewhere.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.260
[Des] I got the whole
thing on tape, anyway.

04:28.310 --> 04:29.930
So Jake will be able to see

It's important. Trust me.

04:49.950 --> 04:50.790
Jake.

04:50.830 --> 04:51.950
You missed Tinny's graduation.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.460
It's not sitting too well
with your father.

04:53.500 --> 04:55.540
Look, I don't have time to get
into it right now, but--

04:55.580 --> 04:57.420
a bunch of people just tried
to light me on fire.

Literally?

Afraid so.

04:59.250 --> 05:00.300
Just get me the billing address.

05:00.340 --> 05:01.840
And ask Dad to meet me there.
Okay?

05:01.880 --> 05:03.090
Yeah. Okay, I'm on it.

05:03.130 --> 05:04.090
Is that him?

05:04.130 --> 05:05.760
Yeah. Good news is--
He's alive.

But Kathleen was right.

to kill him for real.

What?

05:09.640 --> 05:10.560
We gotta go.

Despite my feelings for Doyle,

05:31.410 --> 05:32.490

enough sympathy

and take them down.

grad from Cop school.

of God happened to you?

knocked me out,

tied me up and tried to see

if I'd change color when they
lit me on fire.

06:34.430 --> 06:35.470
You stink.

Worse than your
regular combination

06:36.980 --> 06:38.350
of whiskey and shame.

06:38.390 --> 06:40.350
And the dickweedette,
she left this cell phone behind.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.020
I managed to grab it.

06:41.060 --> 06:42.400
Rose ran the number.

06:42.440 --> 06:44.150
Couldn't get into the account,
but she got a name.

06:44.190 --> 06:46.030
Margot Furling.
And this address.

06:46.070 --> 06:48.110
I tell you.
If they're inside that house,

06:48.150 --> 06:50.320
I can't be held accountable
for what I'm gonna do to them.

06:50.360 --> 06:51.280
Why start now?

06:51.320 --> 06:52.240
I'll catch up.

06:52.280 --> 06:53.200

Oh, and son, seriously.

06:54.910 --> 06:55.290
I know you're stupid.

so sorry that Jake

07:08.970 --> 07:11.220
was unable to provide
security detail for you today--

07:11.260 --> 07:15.220

07:16.270 --> 07:18.890

Five rings.
What took you so long?

07:20.770 --> 07:21.230
Why do you sound far away?

07:22.770 --> 07:24.690
You wouldn't understand the
lengths I have to go through

07:24.730 --> 07:26.610
to entertain myself,
now that Tinny has a new job.

07:26.650 --> 07:28.030
Three masked idiots attacked
Jake this morning.

07:29.110 --> 07:30.700
We need to find out
who's behind it.

07:30.740 --> 07:32.410
Well, Jake's made a lot of
enemies over the years.

07:32.450 --> 07:32.950
And technically,

07:34.080 --> 07:35.370
you'd be number one
on that list.

07:35.410 --> 07:35.990
Des.

07:36.040 --> 07:37.330
I know, I know.

07:37.370 --> 07:39.120
You have a solid alibi,
captured on film by me.

07:39.160 --> 07:42.420
However--
You may have used a body double.

07:42.460 --> 07:43.380
We have a name.

07:43.420 --> 07:44.380
Margot Furlong.

07:44.420 --> 07:45.750
Look into her.

07:45.790 --> 07:47.550
And anyone who might
have a vendetta against Jake.

07:47.590 --> 07:48.260
I'll check in with you later.

07:49.590 --> 07:51.380
Okay. I gotta run.
Jordan Manning just called.

07:51.420 --> 07:53.430
We were supposed to work
a special security detail

07:53.470 --> 07:54.850
for his diamond shipment today.

07:54.890 --> 07:56.300
Jake was handling it, but--

07:56.350 --> 07:57.470
I'm going
to head over there now.

07:57.510 --> 07:58.930
Do you need some backup?

07:58.970 --> 08:02.440
You know, gemology has been
a hobby of mine for, like,

08:02.480 --> 08:02.980
days now.

08:03.980 --> 08:05.190
Thank you.
But I'm good honey.

Alright?

Okay.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.900
A list of Jake's enemies.

08:11.950 --> 08:14.160
I'm gonna need a bigger board.

08:24.540 --> 08:26.380
She's not here.

08:28.630 --> 08:30.800
[Malachy]
All addressed to Margot.

08:30.840 --> 08:32.260
I'm feeling
this was no random attack.

08:33.430 --> 08:35.140
Did you date this girl,
or something?

08:35.180 --> 08:38.180
Ha. Ha.
I know it wasn't random.

08:38.220 --> 08:39.970
She knew
exactly who I was.

08:42.310 --> 08:43.520
Huh.

08:44.520 --> 08:46.270
A sixty day recovery chip.

08:46.980 --> 08:48.270
What are you doing?

08:48.320 --> 08:49.360
Where are your gloves?

08:49.400 --> 08:50.400
Okay, look.
This isn't a crime scene.

08:50.440 --> 08:51.440
Alright?

08:51.490 --> 08:52.860
This place
is not gonna be swarmed

08:52.900 --> 08:55.030
with people with funny little
hats dusting for prints.

08:55.530 --> 08:56.450
Jake.

08:57.620 --> 08:58.990
Jake.
Look at me.

08:59.660 --> 09:00.580
Are you alright?

09:01.410 --> 09:03.750
Yeah. I am.

09:03.790 --> 09:05.630
Good.
Don't go off on me.

09:07.250 --> 09:09.420
Looks like this place was turned
over pretty good.

09:09.460 --> 09:11.250
By Margot, maybe.

09:11.300 --> 09:14.090
Job goes sideways.
And then she skips town.

09:14.130 --> 09:15.510
Grabs all her clothes.

09:15.550 --> 09:17.590
She tears the place up
trying to get all her stuff

09:17.640 --> 09:18.550
and get out of here.

09:18.600 --> 09:19.560
And then the trail goes cold.

09:20.140 --> 09:21.310
Not necessarily.

09:25.690 --> 09:26.600
Margot,
I'm assuming.

09:26.650 --> 09:27.860
Who's the guy?

09:29.610 --> 09:30.980
Hello, Wallace.

09:31.020 --> 09:31.900
You know him?

09:32.690 --> 09:32.990
Jake?

09:34.030 --> 09:36.110
[Wallace]
I hope you like the heat.

09:37.860 --> 09:39.910
Smoke damage your hearing?
Do you recognize him?

09:39.950 --> 09:40.330
Oh yeah.

09:41.910 --> 09:44.790
He's the one who lit the match
at the Jake Doyle barbecue.

09:51.050 --> 09:53.380
[applause]

10:00.550 --> 10:01.850
Katrina.

10:03.720 --> 10:05.020
Sorry to bother you.

10:05.060 --> 10:06.270
You look busy.

10:06.310 --> 10:07.520
Just a case --

10:07.560 --> 10:10.440
A B.S. break and enter
with some missing body

10:10.480 --> 10:12.020
at the Health Sciences.

10:12.070 --> 10:13.570
Waste of time,
if you ask me.

10:13.610 --> 10:15.030
Okay then.
That blows.

10:15.070 --> 10:16.400
It's your first day, right.

10:16.440 --> 10:18.530
In that I graduated, like,
an hour ago. Yeah.

10:18.570 --> 10:20.070
Get into some real
working clothes.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.580
You're coming with me.

10:22.620 --> 10:24.580
I'll meet you at the car.

10:41.090 --> 10:42.600
[Malachy]
Seems awfully personal to me.

10:42.640 --> 10:43.850
Could it be someone we know?

10:43.890 --> 10:45.770
Maybe.
The guy in the goalie mask.

10:45.810 --> 10:47.140
He kept referencing a boss.

10:47.180 --> 10:48.440
In all seriousness,

10:48.480 --> 10:50.600
Des is putting
a list of suspects together

10:50.650 --> 10:51.860
who might want you dead.

10:51.900 --> 10:52.980
But we need a small army

10:53.020 --> 10:54.400
and about ten years
to get through it.

10:54.440 --> 10:55.610
Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

10:55.650 --> 10:56.780
My point is:

10:56.820 --> 10:58.240
Of all the people
who could be behind this,

10:58.280 --> 10:59.860
Kevin Crocker
is number one on my list.

10:59.910 --> 11:01.570
Speaking of --

11:01.610 --> 11:03.700
You knew he was Tinny's
biological father.

11:03.740 --> 11:05.120
But you never said anything.
Why?

11:05.160 --> 11:06.290
It wasn't my business
to tell anyone anything.

11:07.580 --> 11:09.540
And I thought
you might do something stupid.

11:09.580 --> 11:11.580
Like, I don't know,
break through prison glass

11:11.630 --> 11:13.130
and put him in the hospital.

11:13.170 --> 11:14.630
Not everything is about you,
you know.

11:14.670 --> 11:16.000
Yeah, well, if Crocker's
behind this,

11:16.050 --> 11:18.590
if he hired the three Stooges
to come after me --

11:19.300 --> 11:20.340
Well, I'll tell you --

11:20.380 --> 11:22.600
Not even paternity
is gonna save him.

11:24.260 --> 11:26.850
Aren't we supposed to be
at the hospital, or whatever?

11:31.190 --> 11:32.600
If you don't mind me asking,

11:32.650 --> 11:34.650
what are we doing here?

11:34.690 --> 11:37.280
I have a little errand
to run first, constable.

11:38.990 --> 11:40.070
Keep up.

11:46.410 --> 11:47.330
Yeah.

11:47.370 --> 11:48.370
Jake.
That photo you sent.

11:48.410 --> 11:49.160
I got him.

11:49.200 --> 11:50.290
Wallace Thompson.

11:50.330 --> 11:51.960
I found him on
Margot's Facebook page.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.710
He works in a local garage,

11:53.750 --> 11:54.960
is not in a relationship,

11:55.000 --> 11:56.710
went to PWC
and is a male.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.510
Des, text me
the address, and

11:59.550 --> 12:00.880
keep looking into
Margot and Wallace,

12:00.920 --> 12:02.930
see if you can find
anything else.

12:02.970 --> 12:03.930
[ring]

12:03.970 --> 12:05.390
It's Rose.

12:05.430 --> 12:07.220
Malachy,
I'm at Manning's Studio.

12:07.260 --> 12:09.390
He's pretty pissed
that Jake was a no-show.

12:09.430 --> 12:10.980
Probably not a good idea
to tell our client

12:11.020 --> 12:13.150
that Jake was fending off
a pack of crazy fire bugs.

12:13.190 --> 12:13.850
Yeah.
I think I can

12:13.900 --> 12:15.150
smooth things over.

12:15.190 --> 12:16.400
Listen, is there anything
I can do to help you?

12:16.440 --> 12:17.820
Think you can get your contact

12:17.860 --> 12:19.990
to look into any unsolved crimes
in the Torbay Road area.

12:20.900 --> 12:21.900
That's where they grabbed Jake.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.450
Okay, I'm on it.

12:24.780 --> 12:25.910
Sorry about that.

12:25.950 --> 12:27.080
No worries.

12:27.120 --> 12:29.330
And I'm sorry about before.

12:29.370 --> 12:30.750
I get a little edgy
this time of year.

12:30.790 --> 12:33.210
Well, it's a lot of diamonds.
I totally understand.

12:33.250 --> 12:34.420
This has to go smoothly.

12:34.460 --> 12:36.170
Half my business
is custom jewelry.

12:36.210 --> 12:38.250
But the other half,
most of the profit,

12:38.290 --> 12:40.630
comes from selling stones
to smaller businesses.

12:40.670 --> 12:41.840
Just out of curiosity.

12:41.880 --> 12:43.300
Doesn't the courier
have its own security?

12:43.340 --> 12:44.380
Yes.

12:44.430 --> 12:45.390
But we need you,
to be extra, extra safe.

12:46.220 --> 12:48.390
Well, that's why I'm here.

12:48.430 --> 12:50.470
Oh, and I almost forgot.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.310
Oh, yes.
An authenticator.

12:52.350 --> 12:53.640
Yeah, I know.

12:53.690 --> 12:55.190
It generates a code
every twenty minutes.

12:55.230 --> 12:56.650
So I'm gonna need this
to open the front door.

12:56.690 --> 12:58.190
And for the safe.

12:58.230 --> 13:00.900
Oh, and I'll need the other
one back from your colleague,

13:00.940 --> 13:01.860
Jake, was it?

13:01.900 --> 13:02.820
Yeah.

13:02.860 --> 13:03.780
I'll get on that.

13:18.710 --> 13:22.800
[ring]

13:24.630 --> 13:25.550
Hello?

13:25.590 --> 13:27.180
Hello Wallace.

13:27.220 --> 13:29.850
You should know.
I don't like the heat.

13:29.890 --> 13:30.970
At all!

13:40.400 --> 13:41.360
Jake!

13:41.400 --> 13:43.360
Easy. Easy.

13:43.400 --> 13:44.990
You made it out alive.
I'm surprised.

13:45.030 --> 13:46.700
To be honest,
I didn't expect that.

13:46.740 --> 13:48.030
Am I ever
rotted with you.

13:48.070 --> 13:50.120
[punch]

13:50.160 --> 13:51.660
You had to realize
that was coming.

13:51.700 --> 13:52.990
Jake. Jake.
Slow down.

13:53.040 --> 13:54.040
Do you guys expect me to believe

13:54.080 --> 13:55.290
you're here to kill me or
something?

13:55.330 --> 13:57.580
What we really need right now,
are answers.

13:57.620 --> 13:58.750
You know what?
I don't want answers.

13:58.790 --> 14:00.290
I just want to kick the friggin'
face off--

14:00.340 --> 14:01.340
You know what?

14:01.380 --> 14:02.630
Do whatever routine
you got planned.

14:02.670 --> 14:03.670
I ain't saying nuthin'!

14:03.710 --> 14:06.260
Oh yeah?
I got an idea.

14:06.300 --> 14:08.050
How about I take
this lighter fluid,

14:08.090 --> 14:09.260
and pour it all over you.

14:09.300 --> 14:10.970
And then I'm gonna
light you on fire.

14:11.010 --> 14:13.180
How's that sound?

14:13.220 --> 14:14.270
I got a feeling
that you'll light

14:14.310 --> 14:15.430
a hell of a lot faster
than I will.

14:15.480 --> 14:16.730
Jake, think about this.
Come on.

14:16.770 --> 14:18.230
Dad!

14:18.270 --> 14:19.440
Stop telling me what to do.

14:19.480 --> 14:20.520
Why did you come after me!?

14:20.560 --> 14:22.110
Knock it off buddy!

14:22.860 --> 14:23.900
It's freaking gross.

14:23.940 --> 14:25.280
It is gross, isn't it?

14:25.320 --> 14:26.400
You know how I'll get it off?

14:26.450 --> 14:27.570
By lighting it.

14:27.610 --> 14:29.110
Okay.
We were set up to do a job.

14:29.160 --> 14:30.570
Things got out of hand.
That's all.

14:30.620 --> 14:32.120
Out of hand?

14:32.160 --> 14:33.700
Who hired you
to grab my son?

14:33.740 --> 14:35.910
I don't know. Some guy.
I don't know!

14:35.950 --> 14:38.080
All right.
Do it. Light it.

14:38.120 --> 14:39.710
I'm starving.
We gotta eat soon, anyway.

14:39.750 --> 14:41.340
Hey man, what kind of father
are you, anyway?

14:41.380 --> 14:42.290
You listen here.

14:42.340 --> 14:43.380
This--

14:43.420 --> 14:45.920
It probably won't kill you.

14:45.960 --> 14:47.340
But I guarantee
you're gonna feel it.

14:47.380 --> 14:49.220
Oh yeah? I don't think
you're gonna do that.

14:49.260 --> 14:50.180
Not a chance.

14:50.220 --> 14:51.140
Watch me.

14:51.180 --> 14:53.760
Hold on! Hold on!
Don't, don't!

14:53.810 --> 14:54.720
Who hired you?

14:54.770 --> 14:56.140
Who's the boss?

14:56.180 --> 14:57.850
Okay. Margot,
Margot, okay?

14:57.890 --> 14:59.440
She mentioned some guy's name.
She brought me in for the job.

14:59.480 --> 15:00.980
But I didn't meet no boss.

15:01.020 --> 15:02.480
What about the other fella?
The fella in the goalie mask?

15:03.070 --> 15:04.150
She knows him!

15:04.190 --> 15:05.190
I didn't get no name.

15:05.230 --> 15:06.440
They set
this whole thing up, man.

15:06.480 --> 15:08.070
Speaking of Margot--
your girlfriend.

15:08.110 --> 15:09.400
Where is she?

15:09.450 --> 15:10.610
Ex-girlfriend.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.490
I have no idea
where she is, man.

15:12.530 --> 15:14.370
[Monica]
Let him go.

15:14.410 --> 15:15.490
What do you think you're doing?

15:15.540 --> 15:17.790
Is that lighter fluid?

15:17.830 --> 15:19.080
[Jake]
We were just --

15:19.120 --> 15:21.420
I was helping him
fill up his Zippo.

15:21.460 --> 15:22.880
What are you even doing here,
anyway? Tinny?

15:22.920 --> 15:23.840
Yeah.

15:23.880 --> 15:26.170
It's Constable Doyle now.

15:26.210 --> 15:27.130
Wallace!

15:27.170 --> 15:28.090
Get back here!

15:28.130 --> 15:29.430
Not another step, Jake.

15:30.510 --> 15:31.590
Monica.

15:31.630 --> 15:32.550
Monica,
we have to go after him.

15:32.590 --> 15:33.760
He tried to kill Jake.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.100
We were just about
to find out why, okay?

15:36.140 --> 15:38.680
Wally, I'm gonna kill you.

15:38.730 --> 15:42.520
[explosion]

15:46.230 --> 15:47.650
What the hell is going on?

15:47.690 --> 15:50.820
Looks like Jake's
a man of his word.

15:50.860 --> 15:52.950
Put your hands
behind your head.

15:52.990 --> 15:54.450
Now.

16:01.410 --> 16:03.080
Do you actually think
that I'd blow someone up

16:03.120 --> 16:04.500
in front of a cop?

16:04.540 --> 16:05.540
I mean, not that I'd--

16:05.590 --> 16:07.130
blow anybody up

16:07.170 --> 16:08.960
in front of,
you know, anybody.

16:09.010 --> 16:10.300
The bomb attached

16:10.340 --> 16:12.550
to Wallace Thompson's car
was remotely detonated.

16:12.590 --> 16:14.340
By something like a cell phone.

16:14.390 --> 16:16.350
That you were holding.

16:16.390 --> 16:17.640
This phone.

16:18.600 --> 16:20.180
What do I look like?
MacGyver?

16:20.220 --> 16:22.690
I mean, granted, when MacGyver
was actually on the air,

16:22.730 --> 16:24.060
there was no such thing
as cell phones.

16:24.100 --> 16:25.860
So that really didn't make
a lot of sense.

16:25.900 --> 16:27.270
You know Jake.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.860
Ever since I met you,
my life has gotten worse.

16:31.490 --> 16:34.240
And I have a feeling you have
that affect on a lot of women.

16:34.280 --> 16:35.240
[Leslie]
Constable.

16:35.280 --> 16:37.030
I'll take it from here.

16:38.620 --> 16:40.120
Leslie Bennett
to the rescue.

16:40.160 --> 16:41.460
Again.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.800
Oh my God.
Look at you.

16:48.840 --> 16:49.920
Why did those guys

16:49.960 --> 16:50.920
grab you?

16:50.960 --> 16:51.800
Honestly,

16:51.840 --> 16:52.840
I have no idea.

16:52.880 --> 16:53.800
I'm trying to figure
that out myself.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.640
This guy you were following.

16:56.680 --> 16:58.510
He's dead.
This is serious stuff.

16:58.560 --> 16:59.970
I know that,
okay.

17:00.010 --> 17:02.350
I just need to figure out what
those fellas are after.

17:02.390 --> 17:03.390
And who put them up to it.

17:03.440 --> 17:04.480
Fine.

17:04.520 --> 17:06.310
But be careful about
Officer Eyeballs.

17:06.350 --> 17:07.480
If she gets anything on

17:07.520 --> 17:08.940
you or your dad,
she'll bury you.

17:08.980 --> 17:10.110
I hear you.

17:10.150 --> 17:11.740
And I really appreciate
you have my back.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.450
And my front.

17:15.490 --> 17:16.820
And all of me, really.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.000
Where too now?

17:23.040 --> 17:24.420
Well, it looks like
we're back to square one.

17:32.010 --> 17:34.050
I can't believe Wallace is gone.

17:34.840 --> 17:36.430
I mean,
it's ironic.

17:36.470 --> 17:37.720
He tried to take a life
with fire.

17:37.760 --> 17:40.010
But in the end,
the fire took him.

17:40.050 --> 17:41.560
There's a message
in there somewhere.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.560
This investigation
is getting dangerous.

17:43.600 --> 17:44.980
Margot is missing
and Wallace is dead.

17:45.020 --> 17:46.390
I mean,
I hate to say it,

17:46.440 --> 17:48.150
but maybe we need
to back off a little.

17:48.190 --> 17:51.150
Dad, I can't stop until we find
the people responsible for this.

17:51.190 --> 17:52.400
Okay?
What would you do?

17:52.440 --> 17:54.440
Okay, well.
Start again from the beginning.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.740
And see if
we're missing anything.

17:56.780 --> 17:57.860
Alright. Alright.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.030
I was headed to Manning's
studio, okay.

18:00.070 --> 18:01.700
And I was gonna do
the final walk through

18:01.740 --> 18:03.410
for the whole diamond thing.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.290
On the way there,
I was hit from behind,

18:05.330 --> 18:07.120
knocked unconscious.
And the rest--

18:07.170 --> 18:08.750
The rest we already know.

18:08.790 --> 18:11.750
Having been lit on fire many
times, mainly by you guys,

18:11.790 --> 18:13.340
I can recommend the odd aloe.

18:13.380 --> 18:15.470
Oh, and I know a wicked salve
that would really help.

18:16.680 --> 18:19.050
This goalie guy --
Nice sketch, by the way.

18:19.090 --> 18:21.350
He kept saying
that this isn't the plan.

18:21.390 --> 18:23.140
If they intended to kill you,
why were they wearing masks?

18:23.810 --> 18:24.520
Maybe, just maybe,

18:25.810 --> 18:27.770
they were afraid you'd be able
to identify them

18:27.810 --> 18:30.190
in some sort of afterlife life.

18:31.480 --> 18:33.440
Anything you remember about
your goalie?

18:33.480 --> 18:33.650
Yeah.

18:34.940 --> 18:37.740
We can't kill anyone.
The boss'll be pissed.

18:37.780 --> 18:39.280
He's expecting us.

18:39.320 --> 18:39.990
[Jake] He had a tattoo.
Three X's on his wrist.

18:41.160 --> 18:42.830
Almost like they were
Roman Numerals.

18:44.330 --> 18:45.790
Like this?

18:46.450 --> 18:47.790
Exactly like that.

18:47.830 --> 18:48.790
Is that a symbol?
What does it mean?

18:48.830 --> 18:50.080
It's straight edge.

18:50.120 --> 18:51.380
The X's mean
that you stay away from booze.

18:51.420 --> 18:53.630
Like you stay away
from booze and drugs,

18:53.670 --> 18:56.550
and, uh...
the pleasures of the flesh.

18:57.760 --> 18:59.800
[Jake] Margot's sixty
day recovery chip.

18:59.840 --> 19:01.090
Margot's an addict.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.760
The goalie could be in AA
as well.

19:02.800 --> 19:03.810
That would explain the tattoo.

19:03.850 --> 19:05.390
They might have met
at a meeting.

19:05.430 --> 19:06.680
[Des] Okay, I'm gonna cross
reference all the AA

19:06.730 --> 19:07.560
meetings in town

19:07.600 --> 19:08.930
and the meeting places.

19:08.980 --> 19:10.600
And I'll cross reference that
with Margot's house,

19:10.650 --> 19:11.690
and the warehouse.

19:11.730 --> 19:12.860
And then I'll find the location

19:12.900 --> 19:14.230
that the goalie would most
likely attend.

19:14.270 --> 19:15.650
Can you actually do that?

19:15.690 --> 19:17.280
Why you so surprised?
I'm smarter than you look.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.200
Text us the address.

19:19.240 --> 19:19.740
Come on, Skipper,
we got a meeting to get to.

19:20.910 --> 19:22.450
Wait, wait, wait.
Take the fire escape.

19:22.490 --> 19:23.830
It's much faster.

19:23.870 --> 19:25.120
Trust me.

19:26.330 --> 19:27.660
Okay.

19:34.130 --> 19:35.670
Did you call to tip
about a robbery?

19:35.710 --> 19:37.130
[Tinny]
I called.

19:38.550 --> 19:40.090
If is about
that story about Jake,

19:40.130 --> 19:41.130
take it up with my editor.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.550
I'm gonna ask you
a few questions.

19:42.590 --> 19:43.800
I know you're Jake's niece.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.310
And a newly minted cop.
Congrats.

19:46.350 --> 19:47.890
Good.
So we know that I'm a cop.

19:47.930 --> 19:49.180
So you understand
the consequences

19:49.230 --> 19:50.600
of not answering
my questions.

19:51.890 --> 19:53.230
I never intended
to hurt your family.

19:53.900 --> 19:55.150
You mean my uncle.

19:55.190 --> 19:57.400
And I think you did
intend to hurt him.

19:57.440 --> 19:58.780
Or else,
what was your play?

19:58.820 --> 20:00.280
I was doing my job.

20:00.320 --> 20:01.820
This is more than your job.

20:01.860 --> 20:05.330
This is a hatched job against
Leslie Bennett and Jake.

20:06.740 --> 20:07.830
And as far as I can tell,

20:07.870 --> 20:09.290
you and Jake
used to be friends.

20:09.330 --> 20:11.670
Yeah.
We were.

20:12.040 --> 20:13.170
Yes.

20:13.210 --> 20:14.750
So why did you do it?

20:16.340 --> 20:19.340
Fine. But you didn't
hear it from me.

20:19.880 --> 20:21.010
I was paid.

20:21.050 --> 20:22.970
By one of your
fellow officers.

20:23.590 --> 20:24.890
Monica Hayward.

20:24.930 --> 20:26.760
She hired me
to dig up dirt on Jake.

20:26.800 --> 20:28.680
And I got a bonus
for the article.

20:28.720 --> 20:29.850
She paid me cash.

20:29.890 --> 20:31.560
And I got a massive story
out of it.

20:31.600 --> 20:32.890
What was I supposed to do?

20:32.940 --> 20:35.190
Not be a conniving tool?

20:35.230 --> 20:36.650
What is Monica's beef with Jake,
anyway?

20:36.690 --> 20:38.150
She just--

20:38.190 --> 20:40.320
She feels like Jake has the run
of the Police Department.

20:40.360 --> 20:42.280
And that Leslie Bennett
isn't doing her job.

20:42.320 --> 20:43.610
She could have filed
a complaint.

20:43.650 --> 20:45.200
No one would
listen to her.

20:45.240 --> 20:48.200
So she asked me to write that
article to shine some light.

20:48.240 --> 20:50.750
Mess with my family again,
and I will

20:50.790 --> 20:52.160
find a way
to take you down.

20:52.210 --> 20:53.790
I promise.

20:53.830 --> 20:55.630
Now walk away.

21:02.010 --> 21:04.800
So my mother always said I had
an addictive personality.

21:04.840 --> 21:07.930
I suppose she was right.

21:07.970 --> 21:10.640
When I was a kid,
if I liked something,

21:10.680 --> 21:12.930
I mean, really liked it.

21:13.940 --> 21:16.400
Nintendo, man.
I was mad for it.

21:16.440 --> 21:18.860
Hockey. Girls.

21:20.110 --> 21:21.940
Though you can't really
blame me for that.

21:21.980 --> 21:23.820
I mean,
girls are so awesome.

21:23.860 --> 21:25.200
But I guess when
you boil it all down,

21:26.410 --> 21:29.450
for me it's always been
all or nothing.

21:29.490 --> 21:31.370
Nothing was ever enough.

21:32.620 --> 21:35.540
One obsession leads
to another obsession.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.250
It was like love at first,

21:40.290 --> 21:44.300
you know, drop,
when I first discovered booze.

21:46.800 --> 21:48.140
Crap!

21:51.100 --> 21:51.770
Jake.

21:53.180 --> 21:56.140
Why don't you tell everybody
why I'm so mad at you.

21:56.770 --> 21:57.560
He's, um,

21:58.190 --> 21:59.520
my old sponsor.

22:07.530 --> 22:08.950
[Leslie]
That Health Science case.

22:08.990 --> 22:10.120
Have you been down there yet?

22:10.160 --> 22:12.120
I'll get right on that.

22:12.160 --> 22:15.040
You know Monica,
I've been meaning to ask you.

22:16.160 --> 22:18.580
What's your obsession
with Jake Doyle?

22:18.630 --> 22:19.330
Obsession?

22:20.500 --> 22:22.380
I don't have an obsession
with Jake Doyle.

22:22.420 --> 22:24.880
Well, maybe your obsession
is with me.

22:24.920 --> 22:26.510
What's your problem?

22:26.550 --> 22:28.340
Alright.

22:28.380 --> 22:30.340
I dislike Jake Doyle
because he acts

22:30.390 --> 22:32.180
like the rules
don't apply to him.

22:32.220 --> 22:33.350
And you think that's my fault?

22:33.390 --> 22:35.220
Yes.
And it's a shame.

22:35.270 --> 22:37.020
Because deep down,
I believe you're a good cop.

22:37.060 --> 22:39.100
Well in my world, good cops have
each other's backs.

22:40.020 --> 22:41.440
We don't stick knives in them.

22:41.480 --> 22:42.730
That's a tad dramatic.

22:42.770 --> 22:43.860
Not really.

22:43.900 --> 22:45.280
And for the record,

22:45.320 --> 22:48.450
I don't care what you think
about me or my work.

22:48.490 --> 22:50.370
But watch yourself.

22:52.030 --> 22:53.740
[message sound]

23:02.090 --> 23:03.170
Wallace is dead.

23:03.210 --> 23:04.300
You could be next.

23:04.340 --> 23:05.630
This whole thing
has gotten worse.

23:05.670 --> 23:07.300
So much deeper
than it was supposed to.

23:07.340 --> 23:08.340
I'll tell you whatever you want.

23:08.380 --> 23:09.590
I just want it to be over.

23:09.630 --> 23:11.590
How did I end up
covered in gasoline,

23:11.640 --> 23:13.050
about to be toasted alive?

23:13.100 --> 23:14.140
Why did you grab Jake?

23:14.180 --> 23:15.760
It was my boss.
It wasn't us.

23:15.810 --> 23:17.520
He wanted him roughed up a bit,
that's it.

23:17.560 --> 23:19.480
It was a slight shade more
than roughed up.

23:19.520 --> 23:20.480
I know.

23:20.520 --> 23:21.900
That was that bonehead Wallace.

23:21.940 --> 23:23.900
He's the one that took this
to the next level.

23:23.940 --> 23:26.030
Margot brought him in.

23:26.070 --> 23:27.360
She used to go out with
him before.

23:27.400 --> 23:28.360
Before you started going out
with her?

23:29.650 --> 23:31.320
Man, ye crowd are all
too tangled up together,

23:31.360 --> 23:32.620
if you ask me.

23:32.660 --> 23:34.370
I need the boss's name.
The one who hired you.

23:34.410 --> 23:34.950
I don't know his name.

23:36.240 --> 23:38.500
No, but he's got his fingers
in a lot of pies.

23:38.540 --> 23:40.370
Illegal guns, booze, robberies.

23:41.500 --> 23:43.130
Sounds like a couple of people
we know.

23:43.170 --> 23:45.000
This whole thing
was supposed to be quiet.

23:45.040 --> 23:46.800
Now it's a big mess.

23:46.840 --> 23:49.010
So you think this boss killed
Wallace?

23:49.050 --> 23:53.090
He's cleaning up loose ends.
Wallace is dead.

23:53.140 --> 23:54.100
He killed him.

23:54.140 --> 23:55.760
Margot's missing.
I know I'm next.

23:55.810 --> 23:57.810
[ringing]

24:00.350 --> 24:01.230
Rose.

24:01.270 --> 24:01.940
Okay,
I've got a line on

24:01.980 --> 24:03.480
a stream of robberies

24:03.520 --> 24:06.150
in the same area as the Torbay
warehouse about a year ago.

24:06.190 --> 24:07.280
But then they stopped suddenly.

24:07.320 --> 24:08.480
The criminals were arrested?

24:08.530 --> 24:09.990
Those were my thoughts exactly.

24:10.030 --> 24:12.950
So, when I looked at the arrest
records from that period,

24:12.990 --> 24:14.620
one name in particular
stood out.

24:19.200 --> 24:20.580
How are we gonna find this boss?

24:20.620 --> 24:22.540
I don't know who he is.

24:22.580 --> 24:24.580
Margot knows him.
I can help you find her.

24:24.630 --> 24:25.880
What do you think, Dad?

24:25.920 --> 24:29.000
Personally,
I wanna throw him off a rooftop.

24:29.050 --> 24:30.840
But, you know,
then again I am biased.

24:30.880 --> 24:33.590
You track down Margot,
while l look into something.

24:33.630 --> 24:35.680
This is no time to be picking
out a new walker, okay?

24:35.720 --> 24:36.760
I wanna follow through
with this.

24:36.800 --> 24:38.100
Do it.
I got my own lead.

24:38.140 --> 24:40.140
And forgive me if I don't go
sharing it with you.

24:42.810 --> 24:44.150
Let's go check out
Margot's place.

24:44.190 --> 24:45.310
See if we can find anything.

24:45.360 --> 24:46.690
Thanks.

24:46.730 --> 24:47.650
I'm not doing this for you.

24:47.690 --> 24:49.320
Hurry up. Get your coat.

24:50.360 --> 24:51.740
Come on.

24:55.490 --> 24:57.910
Tinny looked really good
at her graduation ceremony.

24:57.950 --> 24:59.490
I'm thinking,
in the director's cut,

24:59.540 --> 25:01.500
I'm gonna keep it
real naturalistic.

25:01.540 --> 25:04.000
And I think
I can get Jake in there.

25:04.040 --> 25:06.040
I'm gonna find
some old security footage.

25:06.080 --> 25:08.000
And then I'm gonna superimpose
it and slice it in.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.920
Speaking of which, Jake doesn't
know why I'm here, does he?

25:09.960 --> 25:12.210
No. Jake's not thinking
clearly right now.

25:12.260 --> 25:14.340
We have to figure out
who's behind this.

25:14.380 --> 25:15.800
And if what Rose says is true,

25:15.840 --> 25:17.640
I think there's something
larger at play.

25:18.550 --> 25:19.760
So--
what are we looking for?

25:19.810 --> 25:21.350
Anything that links back
to Margot.

25:33.820 --> 25:35.530
Like this?

25:37.700 --> 25:40.540
Like I said,
this is between us.

25:44.660 --> 25:46.790
Margot!

25:46.830 --> 25:48.080
Someone's been here.

25:48.130 --> 25:50.670
[ring]

25:51.380 --> 25:53.210
I'll check upstairs.

25:53.260 --> 25:54.420
Hey.

25:54.470 --> 25:55.550
I don't have
to tell you what'll happen

25:55.590 --> 25:57.010
if you try to run off,
now, do I?

25:57.050 --> 25:58.180
No. No.

26:03.100 --> 26:03.810
What?

26:03.850 --> 26:05.020
Is Hughes with you?

26:05.060 --> 26:06.810
Yeah. He's inside
Margot's place. Why?

26:06.850 --> 26:07.810
I think he's lying about

26:07.850 --> 26:09.270
his girlfriend knowing the boss.

26:09.310 --> 26:10.690
[Hughes] Jake! Help!

26:10.730 --> 26:12.610
Dad, I gotta go.
Hughes is in trouble.

26:12.650 --> 26:13.900
We're at Margot's.

26:16.570 --> 26:18.320
Hughes?

26:31.590 --> 26:33.050
Oh.

26:40.050 --> 26:40.890
They're taking Hughes's body
back to the coroner's.

26:42.140 --> 26:44.060
But I think it's safe to say
he was murdered.

26:44.100 --> 26:45.890
Face damaged beyond recognition.

26:45.930 --> 26:48.020
Seems personal to me.

26:48.060 --> 26:49.650
Whoever it was,
they wanted him dead.

26:49.690 --> 26:51.860
Why are you guys here, anyway?

26:51.900 --> 26:53.110
Does this have something to do
with the warehouse incident?

26:54.110 --> 26:55.990
[Malachy]
Leslie, have you heard

26:56.030 --> 26:57.610
anything about
a big time criminal

26:57.650 --> 26:58.320
using a gang of skeets

26:58.360 --> 26:59.860
to do his dirty work?

26:59.910 --> 27:01.740
[Jake] Apparently he's know
around town for being involved

27:01.780 --> 27:02.700
in everything.

27:02.740 --> 27:05.330
Robberies, drugs, guns.

27:05.370 --> 27:07.460
Sounds like every crime boss
in the province.

27:07.500 --> 27:09.460
[ringing]

27:12.330 --> 27:14.000
How's everything going
over there?

27:14.040 --> 27:15.550
[Rose] Just biding my time

27:15.590 --> 27:17.590
until the courier shows.

27:17.630 --> 27:19.130
Things go well at the Pen?

27:19.170 --> 27:20.720
[Malachy] Depends on your
definition of well.

27:20.760 --> 27:23.050
I got a lead,
but Des is following it up.

27:23.100 --> 27:25.140
I wanna be sure
before I tell Jake anything.

27:25.180 --> 27:26.600
I should go.
Oh.

27:26.640 --> 27:29.140
And if you wanna buy anything,
put it on Jake's card.

27:29.190 --> 27:30.270
You have the number.

27:30.310 --> 27:32.810
Of course. Um.
Be careful, okay?

27:32.860 --> 27:33.730
Yeah.

27:33.770 --> 27:35.110
I'm headed back to the station.

27:35.150 --> 27:37.530
You're gonna need to come by
and give a statement.

27:39.400 --> 27:42.700
So did you notice Monica dusting
for fingerprints?

27:42.740 --> 27:44.330
Yes, I did, okay.
So just knock it off.

27:44.370 --> 27:45.780
Where to next?

27:45.830 --> 27:48.250
[Jake] Let’s go see if
Des found anything, alright?

27:54.420 --> 27:57.880
Okay.
So. Wallace and Hughes are dead.

27:57.920 --> 28:01.680
And Margot is unaccounted for.
But, the big boss man --

28:02.840 --> 28:05.140
Well we don't really know
who that is yet.

28:05.180 --> 28:07.640
Des, just run another check
on these tools, okay?

28:07.680 --> 28:09.100
See if you can dig
anything else up.

28:09.140 --> 28:10.310
What about you?

28:10.350 --> 28:11.520
Did you find anything
at the penitentiary?

28:11.560 --> 28:12.440
Anything that'll link this
to Kevin Crocker?

28:12.480 --> 28:13.900
Uh yeah.

28:13.940 --> 28:15.860
Crocker was in the infirmary up
until last week, so...

28:16.820 --> 28:18.650
So?
He coulda had visitors.

28:18.690 --> 28:20.030
Maybe he had some phone calls,
okay?

28:20.070 --> 28:21.820
We know he has a motive.

28:21.860 --> 28:24.240
He's probably the fella that's
behind this whole thing.

28:24.280 --> 28:25.990
And Monica.

28:27.530 --> 28:29.250
She was dusting for prints
at the scenes.

28:29.290 --> 28:30.700
See?
I told you to wear gloves.

28:30.750 --> 28:32.210
Your prints
are all over that place.

28:32.250 --> 28:33.540
Let's just get
to the bottom of this,

28:33.580 --> 28:35.080
before I end up in cuffs.

28:35.130 --> 28:37.790
[ring]

28:37.840 --> 28:40.970
Uh, your phone.
You're phone's on your desk.

28:42.050 --> 28:43.590
What's my phone doing
on my desk?

28:43.630 --> 28:44.550
No idea.

28:47.970 --> 28:49.770
Here's that page you wanted
from the pen.

28:49.810 --> 28:51.600
See if Rose can find
the matching phone records.

28:54.600 --> 28:55.810
Des, why are you calling me?

29:00.530 --> 29:01.440
Pocket dial.

29:01.490 --> 29:03.030
And don't tell Jake what?

29:03.070 --> 29:04.780
What are you two ladies
conspiring about?

29:08.870 --> 29:09.740
Your birthday.

29:10.950 --> 29:12.750
Strippers, candy.
Fee and Chee.

29:12.790 --> 29:14.710
It's all gonna be so wicked.

29:14.750 --> 29:15.080
Surprise.

29:16.540 --> 29:18.420
Let's go examine the body.
See if we missed anything.

29:18.460 --> 29:19.710
That sounds sexy.

29:22.470 --> 29:23.470
What's wrong with him?

29:23.510 --> 29:24.840
[Malachy]
I don't know.

29:29.810 --> 29:30.810
Leslie, do you got a minute?

29:30.850 --> 29:31.850
For the rookie
that just graduated

29:31.890 --> 29:33.140
at the top of her class?

29:33.180 --> 29:34.100
Always.

29:34.140 --> 29:35.350
Have you seen this?

29:37.150 --> 29:38.610
Unfortunately.

29:39.980 --> 29:41.650
I knew I couldn't trust
that reporter.

29:41.690 --> 29:42.940
She's not the only one.

29:44.450 --> 29:45.860
I don't want to be a rat.

29:45.910 --> 29:47.570
But I met with Kyla earlier.

29:47.610 --> 29:49.870
And she said that Monica
paid her to spy on Jake.

29:50.330 --> 29:51.410
She what?

29:52.330 --> 29:54.540
Look, you're not being a rat,

29:54.580 --> 29:55.870
if Monica's not being
a good cop.

29:55.920 --> 29:57.250
And that's not all.

29:57.290 --> 29:59.250
She's approached me
about Jake's cases before too.

29:59.290 --> 30:00.670
Is that a fact?

30:02.170 --> 30:03.630
Why don't you head home?

30:03.670 --> 30:05.260
I'll take care of this.

30:12.010 --> 30:13.600
What's all this?

30:14.680 --> 30:15.890
Constable Hayward

30:15.930 --> 30:17.020
has built a pretty strong case
against Jake.

30:17.810 --> 30:18.730
[Monica]
Jake not only

30:18.770 --> 30:20.190
knew the victim,
Elliot Hughes,

30:20.230 --> 30:22.730
but his finger prints were found
all over the scene.

30:24.190 --> 30:26.320
A witness statement
from an AA meeting

30:27.070 --> 30:28.570
describing Jake's attack

30:28.610 --> 30:29.780
on the victim
earlier today.

30:29.820 --> 30:31.070
[Leslie]
'Cause threatening someone

30:31.120 --> 30:32.700
and killing them
are the same thing.

30:33.790 --> 30:35.410
The guy tried
to burn Jake alive.

30:35.450 --> 30:37.120
Jake was angry.
He wouldn't kill him.

30:37.160 --> 30:38.370
Sorry, Bennett.

30:38.420 --> 30:39.580
You're gonna have
to take a walk.

30:39.630 --> 30:40.670
Conflict of interest.

30:53.760 --> 30:55.600
[knocking]

30:57.480 --> 30:58.600
Hey.

31:00.690 --> 31:02.650
Two five eight seven.

31:04.780 --> 31:06.490
Hey!
What are you doing here?

31:07.650 --> 31:09.700
Kathleen dropped off
a graduation cake.

31:09.740 --> 31:10.820
And it was going pretty fast.

31:10.860 --> 31:12.410
And I didn't want you
to miss any.

31:12.450 --> 31:13.660
Well, that was
thoughtful of you.

31:13.700 --> 31:15.080
I'm deadly like that.

31:15.120 --> 31:17.200
I find the more boring the job,
the lonelier I get.

31:17.250 --> 31:20.210
And this one is like the case
equivalent to Ambien.

31:20.920 --> 31:21.830
Oh. I almost forgot.

31:22.840 --> 31:25.760
Malachy asked me
to drop this off.

31:26.510 --> 31:28.130
The penitentiary log.

31:29.010 --> 31:30.130
You know what this means.

31:30.180 --> 31:31.470
One visit is coincidence.

31:31.510 --> 31:33.390
But if we can get at trail
of phone calls together,

31:33.430 --> 31:35.470
it could be the evidence
we need to nail him.

31:35.970 --> 31:37.060
I hope so.

31:37.100 --> 31:38.850
Can we eat that whole cake
right now?

31:41.560 --> 31:42.560
Hi.

31:44.020 --> 31:44.440
Is it him?

31:45.150 --> 31:46.190
It might be hard to tell

31:46.230 --> 31:47.740
from the position of
the bullet wound.

31:49.030 --> 31:49.900
Jake.
You need to go now.

31:51.070 --> 31:52.950
Leslie, look.
I just need five minutes.

31:52.990 --> 31:54.120
Now is not a good time.

31:54.160 --> 31:55.790
You shouldn't be here.

31:55.830 --> 31:56.790
What's wrong?

31:56.830 --> 31:58.330
Look at this.

31:58.370 --> 32:00.410
Anything odd about this tattoo?

32:00.460 --> 32:01.420
It's smudged.

32:01.460 --> 32:03.130
This isn't Hughes.

32:03.170 --> 32:04.790
We couldn't identify the body

32:04.840 --> 32:06.420
because of the
wound in the face.

32:06.460 --> 32:08.130
And now look at his tattoo.
It's wearing off.

32:08.170 --> 32:09.050
[Malachy]
Who's this?

32:09.090 --> 32:10.630
Some random dead body?

32:10.670 --> 32:12.470
There was a break and enter at
the Health Science last night.

32:12.510 --> 32:13.470
What did they steal?

32:13.510 --> 32:14.850
Just one thing.

32:14.890 --> 32:16.350
A body.

32:17.430 --> 32:18.770
I knew it.

32:18.810 --> 32:21.310
Hughes has been lying
to us from the start.

32:21.350 --> 32:22.520
The shagger faked his own murder
to get us off the scent.

32:24.110 --> 32:26.360
He said Margot knew the boss,
so we wouldn't suspect him.

32:26.400 --> 32:27.820
He steals the body.

32:27.860 --> 32:30.490
dresses it in his own clothes
and stages a crime scene.

32:30.530 --> 32:31.570
But he'd need help.

32:31.610 --> 32:32.450
Margot.

32:32.490 --> 32:33.660
But that still doesn't explain

32:33.700 --> 32:35.370
why they were after you in the
first place.

32:35.410 --> 32:37.410
They must be after some kind
of big payday.

32:37.450 --> 32:38.910
You know, to go through
all this trouble.

32:38.950 --> 32:40.580
Like some kind of big score.

32:44.580 --> 32:45.340
The authenticator.

32:46.630 --> 32:48.590
I was on my way to Manning's
studio last night

32:48.630 --> 32:49.800
when they jumped me.

32:49.840 --> 32:51.420
And now, the card,
the authenticator.

32:51.470 --> 32:52.930
It's gone.

32:52.970 --> 32:55.260
Rose is at the studio right now.

33:03.940 --> 33:05.020
Hurry up, Dad.

33:05.060 --> 33:06.020
We gotta get over
to Manning's studio.

33:06.060 --> 33:07.480
Yes, b'y.
I'm coming.

33:07.520 --> 33:09.780
Jake, there's something I need
to tell you about Monica.

33:09.820 --> 33:11.030
I'm not concerned about Monica.

33:11.070 --> 33:12.610
Jake Doyle.
You're under arrest

33:12.650 --> 33:13.900
for the murders
of Wallace Thompson

33:13.950 --> 33:14.950
and Elliot Hughes.

33:14.990 --> 33:16.030
Under arrest?

33:16.070 --> 33:17.740
Uh, b'ys. Sorry.
Not a good time.

33:19.030 --> 33:21.500
You really know
how to satisfy a girl, Jake.

33:33.670 --> 33:35.930
Are you two a couple?
I'm confused.

33:35.970 --> 33:37.970
Because I thought
she was with the other guy.

33:38.010 --> 33:40.680
So, unless--
are the three of you?

33:40.720 --> 33:41.640
Stay quiet.

33:41.680 --> 33:42.600
Des.

33:42.640 --> 33:44.310
On your knees.

33:44.350 --> 33:46.310
Get down!
Now.

33:46.350 --> 33:49.480
Um, my knees aren't
the greatest. Skateboarding.

33:49.520 --> 33:52.690
You know what it's like.
So I can sit.

33:52.740 --> 33:54.360
Or I could lean.

33:54.400 --> 33:55.570
[Margot] You couldn't just
leave well enough alone.

33:55.610 --> 33:56.530
[smack]

33:56.570 --> 33:57.490
Rose!

33:57.530 --> 33:58.450
Hey!
Careful.

33:58.490 --> 33:59.660
Our futures are in that box.

33:59.700 --> 34:00.830
They're diamonds.
They're indestructible.

34:00.870 --> 34:02.370
Don't worry about them breaking.

34:04.040 --> 34:05.120
[Rose]
Oooh...

34:06.670 --> 34:07.170
Are you okay?

34:07.790 --> 34:08.960
That really hurt.

34:10.250 --> 34:11.550
[Leslie] Monica's been compiling evidence

34:11.590 --> 34:12.960
on you for a while.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.220
She hired that reporter
to spy on you.

34:15.260 --> 34:17.220
And then paid her
to write that article.

34:17.260 --> 34:19.090
You know
that I didn't kill Wallace.

34:19.140 --> 34:20.300
You know that.

34:20.350 --> 34:21.890
I know. But we need
to find Hughes alive.

34:21.930 --> 34:23.640
Put this whole thing to rest.

34:23.680 --> 34:25.020
The evidence is stacking up.

34:25.060 --> 34:26.060
Yeah, yeah.

34:26.100 --> 34:27.600
Margot's cell phone.
My fingerprints.

34:28.060 --> 34:29.230
The bomb.

34:29.270 --> 34:30.440
It's all enough to hold me.

34:30.480 --> 34:31.820
I get it.

34:31.860 --> 34:33.980
Who killed Wallace?
That's what we need to find out.

34:34.030 --> 34:35.820
It's obviously the same
psychopath who tied me up

34:35.860 --> 34:37.200
and tried to burn me alive.

34:45.290 --> 34:47.120
Find Hughes.

34:47.160 --> 34:48.170
What about Monica?

34:48.920 --> 34:50.000
Let me deal with her.

34:51.380 --> 34:54.420
If you weren't working right
now, I would so ki--

34:56.050 --> 34:57.130
Go.

34:57.170 --> 34:58.380
Okay.

34:59.590 --> 35:00.510
Go.

35:00.550 --> 35:02.050
I'm going.
I'm going.

35:05.220 --> 35:06.140
Is Rose safe?

35:06.180 --> 35:07.100
[Malachy] She's fine.

35:07.140 --> 35:08.060
Just a bump on the head.

35:08.100 --> 35:08.640
She and Des are safe.

35:09.350 --> 35:10.810
But Hughes got away.

35:10.850 --> 35:13.400
And, no surprise,
Margot was with him.

35:13.440 --> 35:14.400
Rose tried to stop them.

35:14.440 --> 35:15.530
But they left with the diamonds.

35:15.570 --> 35:16.740
And now that they have
what they need,

35:16.780 --> 35:18.150
they'll be
getting out of town quick.

35:18.190 --> 35:20.410
I think I know the perfect place
to get a getaway car.

35:20.450 --> 35:22.160
Meet me at the garage.

35:32.040 --> 35:35.460
[Hughes]
Ah! Alright. One stop.

35:35.500 --> 35:36.510
And then let's go.

35:43.600 --> 35:46.720
Alright.
Stay here. Okay?

35:46.770 --> 35:47.890
Lock the door.

35:56.900 --> 36:00.280
Doyle.
I'm gonna find you.

36:00.320 --> 36:02.110
This time I'm gonna make sure
you don't have a pulse

36:02.160 --> 36:03.700
when I leave the scene.

36:20.880 --> 36:22.220
[punch]

36:22.260 --> 36:23.590
I'd say we're even now.

36:38.110 --> 36:40.280
I see that you got Margot.
What happened with Wallace?

36:40.320 --> 36:41.450
You just kill him off?

36:41.490 --> 36:42.360
Omph!

36:44.160 --> 36:45.820
I'm all for unconventional
relationships,

36:45.870 --> 36:47.490
but if it's gonna be
three of us,

36:47.530 --> 36:49.290
it's gonna be me
and two girls.

36:50.410 --> 36:51.290
[gunshot]

36:55.420 --> 36:56.880
Nice one, son.

37:08.470 --> 37:11.140
So do you meet all your
accomplices at AA meetings, or--

37:11.180 --> 37:14.060
No just the pretty red heads
with criminal records.

37:14.100 --> 37:16.940
There's nothing sexier
than an exploitable skill set.

37:16.980 --> 37:18.480
That's too bad
you faked your own murder

37:18.520 --> 37:19.860
and then
tried to pin it on me.

37:19.900 --> 37:21.820
I knew the charges
wouldn't stick.

37:21.860 --> 37:24.700
I just needed you out of the way
while we got of town.

37:25.990 --> 37:27.870
Now you and Margot
will be writing each other

37:27.910 --> 37:29.120
love letters from prison.

37:29.160 --> 37:30.080
I hope your

37:30.120 --> 37:31.620
bunkmate doesn't
get too jealous.

37:34.620 --> 37:36.790
Just one more thing.
The authenticator.

37:36.830 --> 37:40.420
Look, I know you're as
stunned as toast, but--

37:40.460 --> 37:42.090
Why didn't you just
grab it from me

37:42.130 --> 37:44.510
when you knocked me unconscious
outside the studio.

37:44.550 --> 37:46.180
Why go through all the trouble
of tying me up?

37:46.220 --> 37:47.300
That was my boss.

37:47.340 --> 37:48.800
As soon as he found out

37:48.850 --> 37:50.640
it was Jake Doyle standing
between him and some diamonds,

37:51.600 --> 37:53.270
he wanted you roughed up a bit.

37:53.310 --> 37:54.980
Who's the boss?
What's his name?

37:55.020 --> 37:56.520
You know his name.

38:03.190 --> 38:05.610
Still pedaling that nonsense
about a boss?

38:06.070 --> 38:07.450
Yeah.

38:16.870 --> 38:18.000
[Leslie] I know you're
responsible

38:18.040 --> 38:19.340
for that article in
the Independent.

38:20.340 --> 38:21.590
You paid that reporter
to dig up

38:21.630 --> 38:22.920
dirt on Jake.

38:22.960 --> 38:24.670
Look, I already got
a lecture from Hood

38:24.710 --> 38:27.550
about that stupid missing body
that I didn't look into.

38:27.590 --> 38:28.840
Thanks, for that,
by the way.

38:28.890 --> 38:31.140
We're all supposed
to be on the same team.

38:31.180 --> 38:32.260
But you can't be trusted.

38:33.350 --> 38:35.270
I suggest you put
in for a transfer.

38:37.650 --> 38:38.850
Tonight.

38:38.900 --> 38:40.310
And if I don't?

38:41.440 --> 38:44.070
I'll be talking
with our superiors.

38:44.110 --> 38:45.570
And Monica, trust me.

38:46.150 --> 38:47.530
When they find out

38:47.570 --> 38:49.950
you bribed a reporter
to slander one of your own--

38:50.530 --> 38:51.160
Me?

38:52.580 --> 38:55.120
You'll be transferred to
somewhere a whole lot worse.

39:05.840 --> 39:09.220
Honors achievement.
Best academic performance.

39:09.260 --> 39:10.340
Well, wherever
you got your brains,

39:10.390 --> 39:11.850
you didn't get them from me.

39:11.890 --> 39:13.600
Actually, she could have got
them from me,

39:13.640 --> 39:15.720
Because I'm a really, really
good influence.

39:15.770 --> 39:18.020
You are.
You really are, Des.

39:18.060 --> 39:18.980
[Jake]
Ahem.

39:19.020 --> 39:19.940
Sorry to interrupt.

39:19.980 --> 39:20.900
Do you mind if I borrow

39:20.940 --> 39:22.860
my lovely, talented niece

39:22.900 --> 39:24.360
alone for a minute?

39:30.200 --> 39:31.450
I'm really sorry that I missed
your graduation.

39:32.160 --> 39:33.410
And I want you to know

39:33.450 --> 39:35.910
that the only thing that could
have kept me away

39:35.950 --> 39:39.210
was being tied up with ropes
and covered in gasoline,

39:39.710 --> 39:41.250
literally.

39:41.290 --> 39:44.500
Well, that would sound crazy
coming from anyone else.

39:44.540 --> 39:47.010
But, it's no big deal.

39:47.050 --> 39:48.970
It is a big deal.

39:49.010 --> 39:51.090
I love you.

39:52.890 --> 39:54.970
And I have something for you.

39:56.180 --> 39:57.310
It's not much.

39:57.350 --> 39:59.350
But it's kinda like
my good luck charm.

40:00.020 --> 40:01.020
[Tinny]
1936?

40:02.270 --> 40:03.900
That's the year that your great-
grandfather

40:03.940 --> 40:05.610
joined the
Newfoundland Rangers.

40:05.650 --> 40:07.860
And he gave it to Dad.
And he joined the force.

40:07.900 --> 40:09.150
And then father gave it to me.

40:09.190 --> 40:10.070
And now--

40:11.360 --> 40:13.620
Now I want you to have it.

40:13.660 --> 40:16.040
It's all you get.
In terms of a dowry.

40:16.910 --> 40:17.660
In case you ever marry Des.

40:18.660 --> 40:22.040
So--
I hope your happy with it.

40:22.080 --> 40:23.250
Thank you.

40:29.420 --> 40:30.720
But--

40:30.760 --> 40:32.470
You're not getting off
that easy.

40:32.510 --> 40:33.430
I want a car.

40:33.470 --> 40:34.800
Standard.

40:35.890 --> 40:37.970
You should ask your Poppy.
You know.

40:38.010 --> 40:40.940
He's probably saved the first
penny he's ever made, so --

40:43.480 --> 40:44.810
Congrats.

40:44.860 --> 40:45.770
Thank you.

40:52.200 --> 40:54.700
Well hello.
You, uh,

40:54.740 --> 40:55.660
you okay?

40:55.700 --> 40:57.450
I dunno.

40:57.490 --> 40:59.410
I let my life --

40:59.450 --> 41:02.410
my personal feelings get in the
way of an investigation today.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.790
And I promised myself I wouldn't
let that happen again.

41:04.830 --> 41:06.290
How about this?

41:06.330 --> 41:08.340
Why don't you let your personal
feelings get in the way

41:08.380 --> 41:11.050
of something happening
upstairs?

41:11.090 --> 41:12.550
You know, something-something
happening.

41:13.220 --> 41:14.800
What do you think?

41:14.840 --> 41:15.760
Maybe.

41:35.780 --> 41:38.120
Diamonds and fake deaths.

41:39.620 --> 41:41.160
Shoulda known it was you,

41:41.200 --> 41:43.330
Not the Doyle I was expecting.

41:43.370 --> 41:45.370
But it's always nice
to see you, Malachy.

41:46.040 --> 41:47.330
Pleasant surprise.

41:48.920 --> 41:50.040
You hired Hughes

41:50.090 --> 41:52.260
when you realized that Jake,
my son,

41:52.300 --> 41:54.800
was the one between you
and the diamonds, didn't you?

41:54.840 --> 41:56.470
Perhaps.

41:56.510 --> 41:59.600
I thought a little tough love
might be necessary.

41:59.640 --> 42:02.060
What are you gonna do Malachy?
Arrest me?

42:02.100 --> 42:02.430
I'll think of something.

42:03.640 --> 42:06.390
Somebody needed to teach
that boy a lesson.

42:06.440 --> 42:08.310
You gotta a leave Jake alone.
I'm warning you.

42:08.350 --> 42:12.280
Your son has angered a lot of
bad people over the years.

42:12.320 --> 42:15.030
I'm just one of them.

42:15.070 --> 42:17.110
But his time is coming.

42:17.150 --> 42:19.910
Whether it's me or someone else
who takes him out.

42:19.950 --> 42:21.200
And there won't be a thing

42:21.240 --> 42:24.330
that you could do about it.
Dad.

42:24.370 --> 42:25.960
We'll have to see about that.

42:27.080 --> 42:28.830
Always a pleasure.
