WEBVTT

00:04.526 --> 00:04.700
.

00:04.743 --> 00:07.137
- In the nation's
largest city,

00:07.181 --> 00:09.879
the vicious and violent
members of the underworld

00:09.922 --> 00:11.489
are hunted by the detectives

00:11.533 --> 00:14.710
of the Organized Crime
Control Bureau.

00:14.753 --> 00:17.234
These are their stories.

00:19.541 --> 00:20.846
- Wow.

00:20.890 --> 00:22.370
- Hey, give me a hand.

00:22.413 --> 00:24.459
- Hey, man, I--I don't think

00:24.502 --> 00:26.678
Jet's all
into the surprise stuff.

00:26.722 --> 00:28.245
- She's gonna love it.

00:28.289 --> 00:30.508
You remember when you made
second grade detective, right?

00:30.552 --> 00:32.858
- Yeah, my wife
was eight months pregnant.

00:32.902 --> 00:36.514
She made spaghetti, and we
fell asleep on the couch.

00:36.558 --> 00:38.212
- Too low.

00:38.255 --> 00:40.257
- Hey, what'd you do
when you made second?

00:40.301 --> 00:42.085
- Got two beers
and a meatball hero

00:42.129 --> 00:44.087
and went
to my father's gravesite.

00:44.131 --> 00:46.437
You guys wanna scope out
your hiding places now

00:46.481 --> 00:48.787
so we won't have to scramble
when she gets here?

00:48.831 --> 00:51.529
- It's time for you
to have kids, bro.

00:51.573 --> 00:54.054
- Thurman here?
- No.

00:58.928 --> 01:00.538
- Sergeant.
- Hey.

01:00.582 --> 01:02.062
You still coming?
You on your way?

01:02.105 --> 01:03.019
- What, to Jet's
surprise thing?

01:03.063 --> 01:04.325
Of course I'm coming.

01:04.367 --> 01:05.630
- Okay, well,
we're about to start.

01:05.674 --> 01:06.849
- I thought you said
it wasn't until 2:00.

01:06.892 --> 01:08.329
- [sighs]
You didn't get my text?

01:08.372 --> 01:10.026
- I've been on the phone
with the brass all morning.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.942
What text?
- She's coming in early.

01:12.985 --> 01:14.726
- Oh, hang on.

01:14.770 --> 01:16.250
Stephen!

01:16.293 --> 01:17.512
- [laughs] Hey.

01:17.555 --> 01:19.470
- How's Mr. Class President?

01:19.514 --> 01:20.689
- I'm still stumping for votes

01:20.732 --> 01:22.865
since student council,
it seems.

01:22.908 --> 01:24.475
You remember my wife, Jennifer.

01:24.519 --> 01:26.173
- Ah, the brains
behind the campaign.

01:26.216 --> 01:27.913
Of course.
- Mm-hmm.

01:27.957 --> 01:29.263
- You--you ready to nail this?

01:29.306 --> 01:31.526
- Oh, he was practicing
his speech all night.

01:31.569 --> 01:33.876
- Because she kept
making changes.

01:33.919 --> 01:36.183
- First impressions
are everything, am I right?

01:36.226 --> 01:37.619
- Saying you're gonna be tough
on crime,

01:37.662 --> 01:40.578
take down the gangs in
Chinatown--you have my vote.

01:40.622 --> 01:42.493
- We should head down,
practice at the mics.

01:42.537 --> 01:44.800
- Mm.
- See you down there?

01:44.843 --> 01:45.757
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:50.327 --> 01:51.676
- Hey, this thing
hasn't even started yet.

01:51.720 --> 01:52.634
We're gonna
have to reschedule.

01:52.676 --> 01:54.157
- She's coming.
- Okay.

01:54.201 --> 01:56.681
I don't think we're gonna be
able to do that.

01:56.725 --> 01:59.554
all: Surprise!
- Oh, my God!

01:59.597 --> 02:01.773
- Hey, hey!
- Yeah!

02:01.817 --> 02:03.732
- What is this?

02:03.775 --> 02:05.864
- This is all for you,
Detective Second Grade.

02:08.258 --> 02:09.607
Congratulations.

02:09.651 --> 02:11.870
- Seriously?
- You earned it.

02:11.914 --> 02:13.959
- Jet, look in the camera.

02:14.003 --> 02:15.178
Come on.
- Put that away.

02:15.222 --> 02:17.615
I'm not kidding.
- [chuckles]

02:17.659 --> 02:19.095
- Thank you.

02:19.139 --> 02:20.314
- Hey, Inspector Thurman
wants to say something to you.

02:20.357 --> 02:21.793
Hey, you still there?

02:21.837 --> 02:24.144
- Detective Slootmaekers,
DI Thurman.

02:24.187 --> 02:26.711
Listen, I wanted
to be there in person

02:26.755 --> 02:28.539
since I'm the one responsible
for making this happen.

02:28.583 --> 02:32.195
But since I can't be,
let me say on behalf

02:32.239 --> 02:34.284
of the entire department...

02:34.328 --> 02:36.982
[gunshots, screaming]

02:37.026 --> 02:38.984
- Thurman?

02:39.028 --> 02:42.249
[tense music]

02:42.292 --> 02:43.902
- Help!

02:43.946 --> 02:45.077
- Thurman, what's going on?

02:45.121 --> 02:46.688
- Get down here right now.

02:50.126 --> 02:52.346
- I was in the green room
when I heard the shots.

02:52.389 --> 02:54.391
Time I got to Lee and Jennifer,

02:54.435 --> 02:56.480
the shooter was running out
through the kitchen.

02:56.524 --> 02:57.525
- You gotta be familiar
with a place

02:57.567 --> 02:59.179
to make that your exit.

02:59.222 --> 03:00.615
- Bus just got Lee's wife
to the hospital.

03:00.658 --> 03:02.660
She took two to the chest.

03:02.704 --> 03:03.618
- How's he doing?

03:03.661 --> 03:05.663
- Shaken, but he wasn't hit.

03:05.707 --> 03:07.665
- I gotta get back to 1PP
to update the brass

03:07.709 --> 03:09.754
and then stop by the hospital.

03:09.798 --> 03:14.237
Look, these are my friends,
okay?

03:14.281 --> 03:16.326
I'm depending on you.

03:18.502 --> 03:20.417
- What's Lee's team saying?

03:20.461 --> 03:22.853
- Nothing.
They're very hesitant to talk.

03:22.898 --> 03:24.682
- I tried to speak
to the kitchen staff,

03:24.726 --> 03:26.293
but no one was willing
to give a statement,

03:26.336 --> 03:28.773
but I did do a headcount after
getting the employees list.

03:28.817 --> 03:32.603
Looks like one, a Daniel Yao,
left right after the shooting.

03:32.647 --> 03:33.952
- Zip on security footage.

03:33.996 --> 03:36.172
- What does "zip" mean?
I see plenty of cameras.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.435
- Owner told me straight up
he wouldn't cooperate.

03:38.478 --> 03:41.612
Doesn't trust police.
- We can help with that.

03:41.656 --> 03:44.876
- Detective Chang, 4th
Precinct, Community Affairs.

03:44.920 --> 03:46.313
Sorry for the delay.

03:46.356 --> 03:47.836
I'll try and get you
the security footage,

03:47.879 --> 03:49.838
but I'm pretty sure
the cams are just dummies.

03:49.881 --> 03:53.276
We worked a gang robbery case
here a month ago.

03:53.320 --> 03:56.584
Anything to share
before we get started?

03:56.627 --> 03:58.542
- Just that
this is our scene now.

03:58.586 --> 04:00.544
Sergeant Bell, Organized Crime.

04:00.588 --> 04:02.938
- Didn't Captain Lin
communicate with you?

04:04.983 --> 04:07.072
Look, we're gonna fare
a lot better here.

04:07.116 --> 04:09.858
So you guys wanna go get
some coffee or something?

04:09.901 --> 04:13.340
- DI Thurman was here
when the shooting happened.

04:13.383 --> 04:14.558
He called us in.

04:14.602 --> 04:15.690
This is
an Organized Crime case.

04:15.733 --> 04:17.692
- And this is Chinatown,
Sergeant.

04:19.128 --> 04:21.348
Things work a little
differently down here.

04:23.611 --> 04:24.960
I'll let you know what we find.

04:32.576 --> 04:35.840
[tense music]

04:35.884 --> 04:42.804
â™ª

05:20.711 --> 05:22.278
- [speaking Cantonese]
- Hey, hey.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.410
How the hell did you
get in here?

05:23.453 --> 05:24.715
- Can you give us an update?
- Yeah.

05:24.759 --> 05:26.108
Being a decent human being
is still something

05:26.151 --> 05:27.283
to strive for in this world.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.154
Get 'em out of here, will you?

05:29.198 --> 05:32.244
Mr. Lee, I'm Detective Stabler.

05:32.288 --> 05:33.376
- From the 4th Precinct?

05:33.420 --> 05:34.638
- No.

05:34.682 --> 05:38.425
- [speaking Cantonese]

05:38.468 --> 05:40.514
- It's my mother-in-law.

05:40.557 --> 05:42.342
- I'm very sorry for what
you're going through, ma'am.

05:42.385 --> 05:43.473
How is she?

05:43.517 --> 05:46.171
- She just got out of surgery.

05:46.215 --> 05:48.826
They don't know yet.

05:48.870 --> 05:52.090
[sighs]
It should have been me.

05:52.134 --> 05:53.918
- Look, I know this is
a difficult time for you,

05:53.962 --> 05:57.269
but I need to ask you
some questions.

05:57.313 --> 05:59.315
- Yeah.
- Okay.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.230
- Once I made the gangs
a target,

06:01.273 --> 06:04.233
my office received
so many threats.

06:04.276 --> 06:06.844
I never thought anything of it.

06:06.888 --> 06:08.846
That's just to be
expected, right?

06:08.890 --> 06:10.848
- Did you report any
of these threats?

06:10.892 --> 06:12.633
- Captain Lin
at the 4th Precinct

06:12.676 --> 06:15.592
was made well aware.

06:15.636 --> 06:18.682
When I was growing up
in Chinatown, these gangs,

06:18.726 --> 06:21.337
they exploited
hardworking people,

06:21.381 --> 06:24.166
my family, Jennifer's family.

06:24.209 --> 06:26.168
We all grew up terrified.

06:26.211 --> 06:29.606
It's the reason we felt so
strongly about taking them on.

06:29.650 --> 06:31.086
- What you said earlier--

06:31.129 --> 06:34.306
you barely caught
a glimpse of the shooter?

06:34.350 --> 06:36.047
Did he say anything?
- No.

06:36.091 --> 06:38.354
- Do you remember
what he was wearing?

06:38.398 --> 06:40.574
Because I have to be operating
under the assumption

06:40.617 --> 06:42.183
that you're still
a target, right?

06:42.227 --> 06:44.447
So I'm gonna assign you
a full-time security detail.

06:44.491 --> 06:46.623
- No.
Jennifer would hate that.

06:46.667 --> 06:50.018
She said our power comes
from our vulnerability,

06:50.061 --> 06:52.760
that we can stand up
to these gangs without guns.

06:52.803 --> 06:54.544
- I can guarantee you
they don't feel that way--

06:54.588 --> 06:56.024
and neither do I.

06:56.067 --> 06:57.721
- Well, frankly, I don't care
what you're feeling

06:57.765 --> 06:59.157
right now, Detective.

06:59.201 --> 07:00.942
[apprehensive music]

07:00.985 --> 07:06.251
And you have no idea
what I'm going through.

07:06.295 --> 07:07.731
- That's fair enough.

07:07.775 --> 07:09.733
All I can tell you
is that I lost my wife

07:09.777 --> 07:12.562
under similar circumstances.

07:12.606 --> 07:14.434
So with all due respect,
how I feel

07:14.477 --> 07:16.653
is exactly what you want right
now,

07:16.697 --> 07:20.048
and more pointedly, my job

07:20.091 --> 07:21.919
is to make sure
that you're safe.

07:25.314 --> 07:27.621
- So much for keeping things
out of the press.

07:27.664 --> 07:28.883
Stephen Lee is a front-runner.

07:28.926 --> 07:30.232
I mean, he's got
his own community--

07:30.275 --> 07:32.016
NYPD, most of the unions.

07:32.060 --> 07:34.454
Maybe one of his opponents
went too far?

07:34.497 --> 07:35.716
Put a hit out on him?

07:35.759 --> 07:37.587
- Yeah, but Lee's
biggest opposition

07:37.631 --> 07:38.893
isn't another politician.

07:38.936 --> 07:40.982
It's the gangs of Chinatown.

07:41.025 --> 07:44.376
- Chinatown has over 20 known
gangs in current operation,

07:44.420 --> 07:45.726
each with a different racket.

07:45.769 --> 07:47.902
Gambling, drug dealing,
and human trafficking.

07:47.945 --> 07:49.860
- Probably 20 more
we don't even know about.

07:49.904 --> 07:52.602
- Yeah, but the major players
are the Black Tiger Gang,

07:52.646 --> 07:55.475
the Doyers Street Gang,
and Snakeheads.

07:55.518 --> 07:57.477
Chinatown has
a closed community,

07:57.520 --> 07:59.217
some would even say
impenetrable,

07:59.261 --> 08:00.436
so this is gonna be tough.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.698
- Where do we start?

08:01.742 --> 08:03.134
- 4th Precinct's
been tracking the threats

08:03.178 --> 08:04.875
to the Lee campaign.

08:04.919 --> 08:07.138
- Okay, why don't you three
canvass the neighborhood,

08:07.182 --> 08:09.010
try to find that kid
that fled the scene.

08:11.273 --> 08:13.231
- You are police officers?

08:13.275 --> 08:15.451
- Yeah.
We're looking for Daniel Yao.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.627
He was working at the space
where Jennifer Lee was shot.

08:17.671 --> 08:20.587
[suspenseful music]

08:20.630 --> 08:22.240
Something I said?

08:25.983 --> 08:27.681
- So Daniel was working
in the space

08:27.724 --> 08:30.292
where the shooting took place.

08:30.335 --> 08:31.815
- [speaking Cantonese]

08:34.557 --> 08:36.167
- No, I don't need a bike.

08:36.211 --> 08:38.299
I'm just looking
for a man named Daniel Yao.

08:44.741 --> 08:46.047
- I think he lives around here.

08:48.049 --> 08:49.050
No?

08:50.573 --> 08:52.662
All right.

08:52.706 --> 08:55.578
- Sarge, we are completely
striking out here.

08:55.622 --> 08:57.667
And that interpreter
hasn't shown up yet.

08:57.711 --> 08:59.103
- Yeah, I can check on that.

08:59.147 --> 09:00.670
Meantime, I got
Daniel's last known,

09:00.714 --> 09:02.411
so I'll forward it to you.

09:02.454 --> 09:04.195
All right, see if you have
any luck with that.

09:04.239 --> 09:06.589
Thanks.

09:06.633 --> 09:08.809
- Case closed already?
- [chuckles]

09:08.852 --> 09:10.027
- You know, the 4th Precinct

09:10.071 --> 09:11.333
is the oldest station house
in the city?

09:11.376 --> 09:12.943
Bit of history for you.

09:12.987 --> 09:15.032
Back in the day, they moved
the front door a few feet over

09:15.076 --> 09:16.686
to the right so an assassin
wouldn't have

09:16.730 --> 09:18.340
a clear shot from the hallway.

09:18.383 --> 09:21.691
I said, "They get this far,
they deserve a clear shot."

09:21.735 --> 09:26.174
So you close my case?

09:26.217 --> 09:29.003
- Like I told your
community liaison officer,

09:29.046 --> 09:30.961
we're running point on this.

09:31.005 --> 09:32.920
- Mr. Lee mentioned to me that
there had been threats made

09:32.963 --> 09:34.530
against his campaign office.

09:34.574 --> 09:35.923
Did you guys check those out?

09:35.966 --> 09:37.881
- Stephen has had a target
on his back

09:37.925 --> 09:40.536
since the day he threw his hat
in the ring for this race.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.757
- Maybe someone wants
to make good on those threats.

09:45.759 --> 09:47.064
- I'll talk to Detective Chang,

09:47.108 --> 09:48.762
make sure she has
all the resources you need,

09:48.805 --> 09:51.808
if you can do one thing for me.

09:51.852 --> 09:54.637
Don't assume you know
how things work here.

09:59.686 --> 10:01.644
- What are you doing?

10:01.688 --> 10:03.124
- Google Translate.

10:03.167 --> 10:04.473
Don't know why I didn't
think of that before.

10:04.516 --> 10:05.692
- Uh, excuse me.

10:05.735 --> 10:07.432
We're looking for someone
named Daniel Yao.

10:07.476 --> 10:09.609
Do you know if he lives here?

10:09.652 --> 10:10.914
- Yo, what's your name?

10:14.483 --> 10:15.571
[tense music]

10:15.615 --> 10:17.268
Whoa.

10:17.312 --> 10:18.443
Stop!

10:18.487 --> 10:25.407
â™ª

10:38.333 --> 10:39.377
Hey!

10:58.005 --> 10:59.920
- Stop!
- Nope!

10:59.963 --> 11:01.443
Hands on the wall.

11:05.839 --> 11:07.623
- I told you,
I don't know anything.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.452
- But you work at the space
where Jennifer Lee was shot.

11:10.495 --> 11:11.671
- So?

11:11.714 --> 11:13.150
- Then why'd you leave
right after?

11:13.194 --> 11:14.978
And why'd you run
from my detective?

11:15.022 --> 11:16.676
- You know what happens
to people who talk

11:16.719 --> 11:18.373
to the police
in my neighborhood?

11:18.416 --> 11:20.897
- Yeah, I do.

11:23.987 --> 11:27.904
But do you know what happens
to people who don't talk

11:27.948 --> 11:30.907
when they've witnessed
an attempted murder?

11:33.344 --> 11:36.696
- There's a kid,
lives on my street, right?

11:36.739 --> 11:38.698
He talked to the cops one time.

11:38.741 --> 11:41.962
Next day, they gave him a box
with his mother's tongue in it.

11:42.005 --> 11:43.746
- Who's "they"?

11:45.792 --> 11:48.751
Give me a name,
and we'll protect you.

11:48.795 --> 11:50.187
- No, you can't.

11:50.231 --> 11:52.624
- Daniel.

11:52.668 --> 11:54.278
You're already in here.

11:54.322 --> 11:57.020
They're gonna assume
you talked.

11:57.064 --> 11:58.979
As soon as you walk out
of here,

11:59.022 --> 12:01.285
that's when I can't help you.

12:04.593 --> 12:05.768
- The shooter's name is Yeung.

12:05.812 --> 12:08.771
[suspenseful music]

12:08.815 --> 12:12.514
He's a member
of the Doyers Street Gang,

12:12.557 --> 12:14.255
biggest gang in Chinatown.

12:16.083 --> 12:17.562
- Pull up everything
we got on them.

12:17.606 --> 12:18.955
- All right.

12:18.999 --> 12:21.566
- I can save you some time
if you like.

12:21.610 --> 12:23.046
- About the Doyers Street Gang?

12:23.090 --> 12:26.528
- Sure, but more importantly,
about him.

12:26.571 --> 12:27.877
He's lying.

12:27.921 --> 12:30.924
â™ª

12:34.318 --> 12:34.536
.

12:34.579 --> 12:37.495
- So is this Captain Lin's
idea of an olive branch,

12:37.539 --> 12:39.802
sending you here to tell us
that the kid

12:39.846 --> 12:42.413
that ran from the crime scene,
that ran from us,

12:42.457 --> 12:44.154
has nothing credible to say?

12:44.198 --> 12:45.808
- No. This visit is all me.

12:45.852 --> 12:48.158
Captain Lin has his methods,
and they're a bit old school,

12:48.202 --> 12:49.681
but I don't work that way.

12:49.725 --> 12:52.423
- So what makes you so sure
that Daniel's lying to us?

12:52.467 --> 12:53.860
- Better if I show you.

12:55.775 --> 12:58.125
The boy on the left is
Daniel Yao, your suspect.

12:58.168 --> 12:59.213
He was 11 there.

12:59.256 --> 13:01.345
And the other one is Yeung.

13:01.389 --> 13:02.999
- The one Daniel said
is the gunman.

13:03.043 --> 13:05.001
- They were regulars
at a basketball clinic

13:05.045 --> 13:06.046
my wife and I started.

13:06.089 --> 13:07.395
- They look pretty tight there.

13:07.438 --> 13:08.831
- When the boys
got a little older,

13:08.875 --> 13:10.702
Doyers Street Gang
recruited Yeung,

13:10.746 --> 13:13.270
lured him with promises
of brotherhood and money.

13:13.314 --> 13:14.706
Unfortunately for Daniel,
the gang

13:14.750 --> 13:17.361
forced Yeung to cut old ties.

13:17.405 --> 13:20.016
But I wasn't one of them.

13:20.060 --> 13:21.975
Yeung is my CI.

13:22.018 --> 13:24.281
And I was with him
at the time of the shooting.

13:24.325 --> 13:26.240
- So Daniel accusing him--
what is that?

13:26.283 --> 13:27.371
A beef between the two?

13:27.415 --> 13:28.459
- That's more than beef.

13:28.503 --> 13:30.200
- Is Daniel with a rival gang?

13:30.244 --> 13:31.636
- I'd like to find out.

13:31.680 --> 13:32.899
But you'd have
to cut him loose,

13:32.942 --> 13:34.422
then track his movements.

13:36.032 --> 13:37.686
- All right.

13:37.729 --> 13:40.428
You guys go give him the good
news and keep an eye on him.

13:40.471 --> 13:41.559
- See if there are
any outstandings

13:41.603 --> 13:42.952
on the Doyers Street Gang.

13:48.915 --> 13:52.309
- Detective, I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

13:52.353 --> 13:55.225
- We all want
the same thing here.

13:55.269 --> 13:57.662
- Basketball clinic?

13:57.706 --> 13:59.664
- Yeah.

13:59.708 --> 14:01.753
It was a way to keep the kids
off the streets,

14:01.797 --> 14:03.581
my service to the community.

14:03.625 --> 14:06.062
- Well,
that's quite a commitment.

14:06.106 --> 14:07.455
- Funny thing is,

14:07.498 --> 14:09.413
clinic actually outlasted
my marriage.

14:09.457 --> 14:11.372
[pensive music]

14:11.415 --> 14:13.853
Now I'm just married to my job.

14:13.896 --> 14:18.553
â™ª

14:18.596 --> 14:21.686
[indistinct chatter]

14:32.262 --> 14:33.394
- What up?

14:33.437 --> 14:34.917
Here to see the man.

14:34.961 --> 14:36.310
- He expecting you?

14:36.353 --> 14:38.051
- No.

14:38.094 --> 14:39.661
But he's gonna wanna see me

14:39.704 --> 14:43.056
'cause I got some news he's
gonna wanna hear...

14:43.099 --> 14:44.622
about the shooting.

14:51.978 --> 14:54.894
[tense music]

14:54.937 --> 15:01.857
â™ª

15:05.339 --> 15:08.124
- You have news for me?

15:08.168 --> 15:10.692
- To move up, I have to
prove my loyalty, right?

15:13.956 --> 15:15.915
I did that for you today,
dai lo.

15:19.440 --> 15:20.832
Cops came around
asking questions,

15:20.876 --> 15:24.967
and I told them
the Doyers Street Gang

15:25.011 --> 15:27.752
shot Jennifer Lee.

15:27.796 --> 15:29.493
They totally bought it.

15:31.060 --> 15:32.932
- Why would you do that?

15:34.934 --> 15:36.892
- So they wouldn't
come after you.

15:38.676 --> 15:41.288
- I'm confused.

15:41.331 --> 15:43.725
Why would they
even come after me?

15:46.467 --> 15:47.947
I wasn't there.

15:50.079 --> 15:52.429
Do you think I was there?

15:52.473 --> 15:53.735
- No.

15:57.347 --> 15:58.305
- Come here.

15:58.348 --> 16:04.964
â™ª

16:06.226 --> 16:09.272
Beautiful, right?

16:09.316 --> 16:13.320
This one's called
a dragon fish.

16:13.363 --> 16:18.629
It's supposed to bring
prosperity and good fortune.

16:18.673 --> 16:20.936
Do you think a fish
can do that?

16:26.376 --> 16:28.074
Yeah, me neither.

16:32.469 --> 16:35.516
You want anything
in this world,

16:35.559 --> 16:37.518
you have to make it happen
yourself...

16:39.128 --> 16:40.608
Like you tried today.

16:42.958 --> 16:45.178
Unfortunately,
you made a big mistake

16:45.221 --> 16:47.093
not checking with me first.

16:51.445 --> 16:52.837
[speaking Cantonese]

16:57.886 --> 17:00.236
Don't let him out
of your sight.

17:00.280 --> 17:07.156
â™ª

17:10.333 --> 17:12.770
- Jet, see if you can
get an ID on this guy.

17:12.814 --> 17:14.119
Sending a photo now.

17:14.163 --> 17:16.773
We watched Daniel
enter this building.

17:16.818 --> 17:18.906
This is the first guy
to come out.

17:20.387 --> 17:21.823
- Yuze Zhao.

17:21.866 --> 17:23.912
High rank in the
Black Tigers Street Gang.

17:23.954 --> 17:26.262
- So Daniel does have
gang affiliation.

17:26.306 --> 17:27.959
- Oh, jackpot.

17:28.002 --> 17:30.092
There's a warrant out
for Yuze's arrest.

17:30.136 --> 17:31.920
Gun charge.

17:31.963 --> 17:33.922
- Follow Yuze.
See where he goes.

17:33.965 --> 17:35.880
Look for anything else
we might need.

17:37.360 --> 17:40.407
- Hey, didn't the Feds
bust the Black Tigers

17:40.450 --> 17:42.713
for sex trafficking
and gambling, like, years ago?

17:42.757 --> 17:45.064
- It's a new dawn,
it's a new day.

17:49.372 --> 17:50.504
- There he is.

17:53.637 --> 17:55.596
We're on Doyers Street, right?

17:55.639 --> 17:58.120
- Yeah, he's definitely
in enemy territory.

17:58.164 --> 18:05.084
â™ª

18:16.269 --> 18:18.532
- Sarge, we lost him.

18:23.363 --> 18:23.580
.

18:23.624 --> 18:25.147
- I'm here to see Mr. Lee.

18:25.191 --> 18:26.801
- Mr. Lee's in a meeting.

18:26.844 --> 18:28.150
- Who are you?

18:28.194 --> 18:30.239
- He's okay. Let him in.

18:32.850 --> 18:34.548
Detective Stabler?
- Yes.

18:34.591 --> 18:36.767
- Michael Quan,
Stephen's campaign advisor.

18:36.811 --> 18:38.552
- Oh, hey. Uh, who are they?

18:38.595 --> 18:40.162
They're not part
of my security detail.

18:40.206 --> 18:42.643
- Oh, you weren't notified?
- No.

18:42.686 --> 18:45.994
- [sighs] We felt that Stephen
would be better suited

18:46.037 --> 18:47.038
with private security.

18:47.082 --> 18:49.171
Plus my men are local.

18:49.215 --> 18:50.607
It's a much better fit for him.

18:50.651 --> 18:53.175
Oh, uh, Stephen's in the back.
Come.

18:53.219 --> 18:55.264
So do you have
any leads yet, Detective?

18:55.308 --> 18:56.874
- Making progress.

18:56.918 --> 18:58.659
- Detective Stabler.

18:58.702 --> 19:00.835
I'll call you right back.

19:00.878 --> 19:02.576
I see you've met Michael Quan.

19:02.619 --> 19:05.709
We've known each other, what,
since I was six, seven?

19:05.753 --> 19:07.233
- Yeah.

19:07.276 --> 19:09.104
When Stephen's mother
and father came to America,

19:09.148 --> 19:12.673
I helped them find
an apartment, a job.

19:12.716 --> 19:14.414
It's what we do.
We take care of our own.

19:14.457 --> 19:15.893
- Sure.

19:15.937 --> 19:17.852
- Recently, I was helping
to build Mott Street House.

19:17.895 --> 19:21.029
- Uh, it's a woman's shelter
under Jennifer's foundation.

19:21.072 --> 19:23.988
It houses victims
of human trafficking.

19:24.032 --> 19:26.730
- Stephen, I'm afraid I owe
Detective Stabler an apology

19:26.774 --> 19:29.080
for not informing him
of our decision

19:29.124 --> 19:31.344
to replace the security.

19:31.387 --> 19:32.867
- Can we speak privately?

19:32.910 --> 19:34.477
- Sure.

19:34.521 --> 19:36.000
- Yeah.

19:36.044 --> 19:37.263
If there's any more
I can do to help,

19:37.306 --> 19:39.352
please don't hesitate.
- Thank you.

19:41.267 --> 19:43.356
- Michael is one
of the community's

19:43.399 --> 19:47.186
most respected businessmen
and my biggest campaign donor.

19:48.578 --> 19:51.277
- I hear Jennifer is improving.

19:51.320 --> 19:54.758
- It's still touch and go,
but the surgery went well.

19:54.802 --> 19:56.238
- How are you doing?

19:59.720 --> 20:02.375
- You know how I'm doing.

20:02.418 --> 20:05.291
I looked up
what happened to your wife.

20:05.334 --> 20:08.076
[soft sentimental music]

20:08.119 --> 20:10.818
What a tragedy.

20:10.861 --> 20:12.298
I'm sorry.

20:14.778 --> 20:18.608
- Thank you.
No need to be sorry.

20:18.652 --> 20:23.265
It only becomes a real tragedy
if justice isn't served, so.

20:25.441 --> 20:28.531
- I think you and Jennifer
would really get along.

20:29.837 --> 20:31.273
[phone buzzes]

20:33.971 --> 20:35.146
- Could you give me one second?

20:35.190 --> 20:36.539
- Sure.
- Yeah, Sarge.

20:39.325 --> 20:41.936
[suspenseful music]

20:41.979 --> 20:45.244
[indistinct chatter]

20:46.810 --> 20:48.159
What is this?

20:48.203 --> 20:50.118
- Somebody put out a reward,

20:50.161 --> 20:51.554
so now everybody
in New York City

20:51.598 --> 20:54.165
thinks they know
who shot Jennifer Lee.

20:56.907 --> 20:58.605
- We have a promising
list of leads.

20:58.648 --> 21:00.737
I want your squad to start
tracking them down ASAP.

21:00.781 --> 21:02.522
- Let me just ask
something here.

21:02.565 --> 21:04.001
When was the last time
you heard

21:04.045 --> 21:07.440
of an anonymous donor
ponying up 100 grand,

21:07.483 --> 21:08.832
no strings attached?

21:08.876 --> 21:10.530
- What are you getting at here,
Detective?

21:10.573 --> 21:12.923
- It's just that first,
no one wants to talk to us.

21:12.967 --> 21:14.577
Now all of a sudden,
we're flooded with leads.

21:14.621 --> 21:17.101
It just feels like
a smokescreen.

21:17.145 --> 21:18.581
- If that's the case,
someone is going

21:18.625 --> 21:20.801
to great lengths
to distract us.

21:20.844 --> 21:22.455
- We can't afford to leave
any stone unturned.

21:22.498 --> 21:23.978
- Can't afford to waste time,
either.

21:24.021 --> 21:26.720
- Captain Lin, I'm not sure
if you've been made aware,

21:26.763 --> 21:30.680
but my team tracked Yuze Zhao
from the Black Tiger Gang

21:30.724 --> 21:33.770
entering Doyers Street
territory recently.

21:33.814 --> 21:36.295
- Sure it was Yuze?

21:36.338 --> 21:37.687
[knock at door]

21:39.254 --> 21:40.995
- Inspector,
this is Detective Chang.

21:41.038 --> 21:42.475
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:42.518 --> 21:45.347
- Connected with Yeung,
my CI, inside Doyers Street.

21:45.391 --> 21:46.827
- Yeah, did you find
anything out?

21:46.870 --> 21:48.219
- Your team was right.

21:48.263 --> 21:49.656
Yuze made contact
with Doyers Street

21:49.699 --> 21:52.049
and has a face-to-face
with their top guy tomorrow.

21:52.093 --> 21:54.574
- And what does all this mean?
- Not sure yet.

21:54.617 --> 21:56.967
- So we're gonna need eyes
and ears all over this thing.

21:57.011 --> 21:59.361
- My team can manage
the crowd out there.

21:59.405 --> 22:01.015
If anything credible
comes across my desk,

22:01.058 --> 22:02.190
I'll let you know.

22:02.233 --> 22:04.627
- Hey.

22:04.671 --> 22:06.107
If one of these gangs
is responsible

22:06.150 --> 22:08.327
for coming after the Lees,

22:08.370 --> 22:10.024
I want them taken down.

22:10.067 --> 22:13.288
[tense music]

22:13.332 --> 22:16.422
â™ª

22:16.465 --> 22:19.381
- Looks like we can
take either the N or the R

22:19.425 --> 22:21.035
to Times Square, honey.
- Thank you.

22:21.078 --> 22:22.253
- Want one, babe?

22:22.297 --> 22:25.082
- No, thanks, I'm good.

22:25.126 --> 22:27.868
We've got eyes on a male,
fits Kai's description,

22:27.911 --> 22:29.173
head of Doyers Street.

22:29.217 --> 22:35.919
â™ª

22:41.142 --> 22:43.405
- I've got eyes
on them as well.

22:43.449 --> 22:45.276
Looks like he's alone.

22:52.327 --> 22:53.720
- I got eyes on Yuze too.

22:53.763 --> 22:57.071
He's walking
with an unidentified male.

22:57.114 --> 22:59.421
Wait.

22:59.465 --> 23:01.423
It's Daniel.

23:03.120 --> 23:05.035
- Does he see you?

23:05.079 --> 23:06.559
- He's looking right at me.

23:06.602 --> 23:08.038
- All right, we're moving in.

23:08.082 --> 23:09.083
- Hold on. Wait.

23:09.126 --> 23:16.046
â™ª

23:17.396 --> 23:18.440
We're good.

23:18.484 --> 23:19.746
- What's going on?

23:19.789 --> 23:22.488
- He's too scared.
He's not gonna talk.

23:25.012 --> 23:26.448
- Jamie and Jet?

23:28.798 --> 23:30.583
- You should be hearing this.

23:30.626 --> 23:32.498
- So what's so urgent, huh?

23:32.541 --> 23:35.152
- This is Daniel.

23:35.196 --> 23:38.242
He has something to say.

23:38.286 --> 23:40.941
Tell him.

23:40.984 --> 23:43.204
- Cops picked me up.

23:43.247 --> 23:45.119
I told them I thought
you guys were the ones

23:45.162 --> 23:47.121
who shot the councilman's wife.

23:47.164 --> 23:48.905
- You did what?

23:48.949 --> 23:51.517
- I make sure
he paid for his mistake.

23:51.560 --> 23:53.083
- Why'd you do it
in the first place, huh?

23:53.127 --> 23:54.607
- It doesn't matter, all right?

23:54.650 --> 23:57.131
We need to stick together
right now.

23:57.174 --> 23:59.481
Cops are going to come
for all of us at some point.

24:01.004 --> 24:02.615
- Stick together?

24:02.658 --> 24:04.399
We didn't take that shot.

24:04.443 --> 24:09.404
And whoever did missed
and got the wife.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.841
- So you think
they missed, huh?

24:16.542 --> 24:19.849
- You wanna do right by me?

24:19.893 --> 24:20.894
Give me the kid.

24:20.937 --> 24:26.813
â™ª

24:26.856 --> 24:30.033
How do I know he's not
gonna talk again, huh?

24:30.077 --> 24:33.472
- If I do that, we good?

24:35.474 --> 24:37.301
Don't get sloppy.

24:37.345 --> 24:39.390
- Help! Help! Help!

24:39.434 --> 24:40.914
They're gonna kill me!

24:40.957 --> 24:42.176
- Move in. Let's go.

24:42.219 --> 24:44.395
- Help! They're gonna kill me!

24:47.224 --> 24:48.878
[engine revving]

24:48.922 --> 24:50.314
- Police!

24:50.358 --> 24:52.273
- Go, go, go, go!

24:52.316 --> 24:54.971
[engine roaring,
tires squealing]

24:55.015 --> 24:56.669
- Damn it.

24:59.759 --> 25:01.282
- Right there. Right there.

25:01.325 --> 25:03.327
Right there.
Hands on that rock.

25:03.371 --> 25:04.938
Don't move.

25:11.031 --> 25:11.248
.

25:11.292 --> 25:13.990
- You have quite a rÃ©sumÃ©.

25:14.034 --> 25:18.517
robbery, possession,
human trafficking,

25:18.560 --> 25:20.431
all before you were 21.

25:20.475 --> 25:22.999
- I've always been
an overachiever.

25:23.043 --> 25:25.872
- You're well-connected
in Chinatown.

25:25.915 --> 25:29.528
So what can you tell me
about the, uh,

25:29.571 --> 25:31.573
the hit on Stephen Lee?

25:31.617 --> 25:33.009
- Didn't they shoot his wife?

25:34.054 --> 25:36.622
- Who's they?

25:36.665 --> 25:37.884
- Whoever pulled the trigger.

25:37.927 --> 25:39.973
[speaking Cantonese]

25:40.016 --> 25:42.976
- [speaking Cantonese]

25:51.941 --> 25:54.814
- He's doing a bad job
of flirting.

25:54.857 --> 25:58.731
- So whoever shot Ms. Lee

25:58.774 --> 26:01.821
had a pretty good idea
of the layout of that place.

26:01.864 --> 26:04.519
Lot of workers there that day.

26:04.563 --> 26:08.001
But you know, when the bullets
started flying,

26:08.044 --> 26:11.657
only one of those workers ran.

26:11.700 --> 26:14.573
Daniel Yao.

26:14.616 --> 26:16.923
You know Daniel Yao.

26:16.966 --> 26:19.490
Now, did he share
with you the quickest way

26:19.534 --> 26:22.319
to exit that place?

26:22.363 --> 26:24.234
- Is he serious?

26:24.278 --> 26:27.020
[suspenseful music]

26:27.063 --> 26:28.369
That's why I'm here?

26:33.200 --> 26:37.421
No, he did not.

26:37.465 --> 26:38.858
Can I go now?

26:38.901 --> 26:42.252
- No, you can't.

26:42.296 --> 26:44.428
We have an outstanding warrant
for you.

26:46.169 --> 26:48.868
- In that case,

26:48.911 --> 26:50.913
I would like my lawyer now.

26:52.741 --> 26:55.135
Thank you.

26:55.178 --> 26:56.397
- [speaks language]

26:58.834 --> 27:03.012
- [repeats phrase]
[laughs]

27:03.056 --> 27:09.105
â™ª

27:09.149 --> 27:10.933
- Hey. You're still here.

27:10.977 --> 27:12.369
- Just trying
to make sense of things,

27:12.413 --> 27:14.676
but I'm running around
in circles.

27:14.720 --> 27:17.026
- Okay. Take a break.
Chang is coming up.

27:17.070 --> 27:18.593
She says she has someone
for us to meet.

27:18.637 --> 27:21.117
It could be important.

27:21.161 --> 27:25.252
- Lily was kidnapped
from Hangzhou when she was 17.

27:25.295 --> 27:29.430
- And put to work.
- Trafficked by Yuze Zhao.

27:29.473 --> 27:33.260
- One year later,
I become pregnant.

27:33.303 --> 27:37.743
Yuze no more use for me,
so he--he kick me out.

27:37.786 --> 27:39.135
I--

27:39.179 --> 27:42.008
- She was left homeless
with nowhere to go.

27:42.051 --> 27:44.619
- Miss Lee, she saved me.

27:44.663 --> 27:47.622
Mott Street House.
She helped me.

27:47.666 --> 27:52.105
I have child, apartment, job.
Miss Lee help me.

27:52.148 --> 27:54.020
I have a life now.

27:54.063 --> 27:56.065
- Lily worked hard
to get where she is.

27:56.109 --> 27:57.806
She's a patient coordinator

27:57.850 --> 27:59.329
at the Chinatown
Community Medical.

27:59.373 --> 28:02.506
- That's really wonderful.
- Congratulations.

28:02.550 --> 28:06.467
- Miss Lee help everybody.
She help all the girls.

28:06.510 --> 28:09.426
Everybody friend to Miss Lee.

28:09.470 --> 28:11.559
- Unless you're a trafficker.

28:15.781 --> 28:18.044
- Thank you so much, Lily.

28:18.087 --> 28:20.002
Detective Chang,
we'll be in touch.

28:25.704 --> 28:28.445
Well, we've been looking
at this thing backwards.

28:28.489 --> 28:30.970
- Remember what Yuze said
in the park?

28:31.013 --> 28:33.363
"You think they missed?"

28:33.407 --> 28:35.322
Those bullets weren't meant
for Stephen.

28:35.365 --> 28:38.412
- The real target
was Jennifer Lee.

28:38.455 --> 28:40.980
[suspenseful music]

28:41.023 --> 28:43.112
- [scoffs]
What?

28:43.156 --> 28:44.200
No, she wasn't the target.

28:44.244 --> 28:46.072
I was the target.

28:46.115 --> 28:48.857
Everyone loves Jennifer.

28:48.901 --> 28:51.207
She was doing God's work.

28:51.251 --> 28:54.297
She helped countless women
get back on their feet,

28:54.341 --> 28:55.603
people who came here
with nothing

28:55.646 --> 28:57.779
and were taken advantage of
in so many ways.

28:57.823 --> 29:00.739
- I guess sometimes the reality
is that doing God's work

29:00.782 --> 29:02.349
can get you in trouble.

29:02.392 --> 29:04.220
- This person
you have in custody,

29:04.264 --> 29:06.527
is there a reason why
they would come after her?

29:06.570 --> 29:09.530
- We're still working on that.

29:09.573 --> 29:11.488
It's one of the reasons
why I'm here.

29:13.142 --> 29:18.104
- I can't--I can't
do this anymore.

29:18.147 --> 29:20.367
- Can't do what?

29:20.410 --> 29:23.457
- My wife is in a hospital
with a tube down her throat,

29:23.500 --> 29:26.808
and I'm trying to get votes?

29:26.852 --> 29:28.810
I can't do it.

29:30.594 --> 29:32.771
[panting]

29:34.860 --> 29:36.296
I'm dropping out of the race.

29:36.339 --> 29:43.651
â™ª

29:44.304 --> 29:46.741
- Sorry, I don't
have much time.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.438
We've done our best
to keep things normal

29:48.482 --> 29:50.876
around here without Jennifer.

29:50.919 --> 29:52.399
How can I help?

29:52.442 --> 29:55.837
- How involved is Jennifer
in the day-to-day here?

29:55.881 --> 29:59.275
- She is the heart and soul
of this place.

30:01.495 --> 30:03.802
That's her personal story
of surviving human trafficking

30:03.845 --> 30:07.457
that empowers many of the women
here to rebuild their lives.

30:09.285 --> 30:12.114
[speaking Cantonese]

30:15.074 --> 30:17.424
- We have reason
to believe that Jennifer

30:17.467 --> 30:20.427
was the intended target.

30:20.470 --> 30:22.733
- Why would anyone
wanna kill Jennifer?

30:22.777 --> 30:23.822
- That's why we're here.

30:23.865 --> 30:25.998
Did she receive any threats?

30:26.041 --> 30:29.392
- We're a shelter for women
fleeing violent situations.

30:29.436 --> 30:31.090
Threats are a norm around here.

30:31.133 --> 30:32.613
Some of them
are paying off debts

30:32.656 --> 30:34.789
for being smuggled here
by Snakeheads.

30:34.833 --> 30:36.747
- Anything or anyone
stand out recently?

30:39.489 --> 30:42.318
- There was this
one woman, Mei.

30:42.362 --> 30:44.407
She stayed here
for about a month.

30:44.451 --> 30:45.887
She and Jennifer
became very close,

30:45.931 --> 30:48.237
then they had some kind
of falling out.

30:48.281 --> 30:49.935
- Over what?

30:49.978 --> 30:51.632
- Jennifer just said that Mei
was involved with something

30:51.675 --> 30:54.330
at the bank where she worked.

30:54.374 --> 30:55.810
That's all I know.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.159
I never saw Mei again.

31:00.815 --> 31:03.557
- Okay, call me
when you get to the hospital.

31:03.600 --> 31:06.081
See if Stephen Lee can give us
anything on Mei Shen.

31:06.125 --> 31:09.476
We'll do the same. Okay.

31:09.519 --> 31:11.391
Any luck?
- Nothing.

31:11.434 --> 31:14.873
No green card,
no driver's license,

31:14.916 --> 31:17.832
no address,
no asylum applications.

31:17.876 --> 31:21.444
There is no record
of Mei Shen anywhere.

31:21.488 --> 31:22.924
- So she's taken
from her homeland

31:22.968 --> 31:24.273
and smuggled into New York...

31:24.317 --> 31:25.448
- Where she's forced
to pay off a debt

31:25.492 --> 31:26.928
to her own trafficker...

31:26.972 --> 31:29.278
- Probably in the neighborhood
of $75,000.

31:29.322 --> 31:31.324
- Money she'll never be able
to pay back.

31:31.367 --> 31:34.196
- She's somebody's daughter.
Sister.

31:34.240 --> 31:36.851
Now she'll be indentured
for life.

31:45.729 --> 31:47.209
- Mr. Lee?

31:47.253 --> 31:48.515
- Detective.

31:48.558 --> 31:50.473
- I--I called
your campaign office,

31:50.517 --> 31:51.866
and they said you'd be here.

31:51.910 --> 31:54.825
I'm sorry to bother you.

31:54.869 --> 31:56.958
- Um, it's fine.

31:57.002 --> 31:58.525
- Yeah, thank you.

32:00.048 --> 32:02.398
- Michael suggested
I make an announcement

32:02.442 --> 32:04.705
to the press and my supporters.

32:04.748 --> 32:07.186
I'm trying to find
the right words.

32:07.229 --> 32:09.101
- I'm sure you will.

32:09.144 --> 32:11.190
- Thank you. How can I help?

32:11.233 --> 32:13.583
- Well, you know, in the course
of our investigation,

32:13.627 --> 32:16.064
the name Mei Shen comes up.

32:16.108 --> 32:17.413
Jennifer ever mention her?

32:17.457 --> 32:19.111
She was a resident
at the shelter?

32:19.154 --> 32:21.330
Didn't say there very long--
maybe a month or so.

32:21.374 --> 32:22.897
- Yeah, Mei Shen.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.682
Yes, I remember Jennifer
talked about her.

32:25.726 --> 32:28.381
She said Mei
was in some kind of trouble,

32:28.424 --> 32:30.687
circumstances forced her
to leave.

32:30.731 --> 32:32.689
- She say anything
about that situation?

32:32.733 --> 32:34.865
Where she might have gone?

32:34.909 --> 32:37.129
- Mm, a lot of girls
come through there

32:37.172 --> 32:39.522
and have many problems.
- Sure.

32:39.566 --> 32:41.872
- Jennifer didn't
get into specifics.

32:41.916 --> 32:43.700
She would never
betray a confidence

32:43.744 --> 32:46.225
by revealing personal details.

32:46.268 --> 32:48.401
- Mm.

32:48.444 --> 32:51.230
[sighs] Unfortunately, details

32:51.273 --> 32:53.536
is exactly
what I need right now.

32:56.975 --> 33:03.938
â™ª

33:16.646 --> 33:18.997
- Guess I am a politician
after all.

33:24.698 --> 33:27.875
- One text from Jennifer
to Mei Shen.

33:32.053 --> 33:33.489
- Address in Queens.

33:34.969 --> 33:37.058
- He said
she's on the third floor.

33:37.102 --> 33:40.409
Her name's Mei Shen.

33:40.453 --> 33:43.021
- This gotta be her apartment.

33:43.064 --> 33:44.065
- Oh.
- Call a bus!

33:44.109 --> 33:45.458
- Yep. Got it.

33:45.501 --> 33:52.639
â™ª

33:56.208 --> 33:56.382
.

33:56.425 --> 33:58.862
- According to the shelter,
Mei had been in the States

33:58.906 --> 34:00.386
a couple months.
No visa, no paper trail.

34:00.429 --> 34:02.083
- Family back in China?

34:02.127 --> 34:03.998
- Well, only Jennifer Lee
can answer that for us.

34:04.042 --> 34:06.174
- She was likely smuggled in
and paying off her debts.

34:06.218 --> 34:07.436
- No way she was
doing that at a bank.

34:07.480 --> 34:09.090
It must have been a cover.
- Ballistics.

34:09.134 --> 34:11.310
Bullet that killed Mei Shen
matches the markings

34:11.353 --> 34:13.094
on the bullet that
hit Jennifer Lee.

34:13.138 --> 34:14.791
- Okay, so we have two women
gunned down,

34:14.835 --> 34:18.404
one weapon, two gangs beefing,

34:18.447 --> 34:20.188
and a global bank?

34:20.232 --> 34:22.712
- I can try to pull together
a list of the bank's clients.

34:22.755 --> 34:24.018
- To try and find a pattern.

34:24.062 --> 34:25.889
[phone chimes]
Good idea.

34:25.933 --> 34:27.804
Everything all right?

34:27.848 --> 34:30.068
- It's a text from Captain Lin.

34:30.110 --> 34:31.721
The 4th is making a move.

34:31.764 --> 34:34.724
[tense music]

34:34.768 --> 34:37.074
â™ª

34:37.118 --> 34:39.293
- Police! Don't move.
- Stay seated.

34:39.338 --> 34:40.687
[patrons clamoring]

34:40.730 --> 34:42.819
- Hands on the table!

34:47.563 --> 34:49.261
- Police! Drop the weapon.

34:49.304 --> 34:56.224
â™ª

35:32.695 --> 35:35.481
- Thank you for the
stellar work, Captain Lin.

35:35.524 --> 35:37.178
- We had an agreement.

35:37.222 --> 35:38.614
You did not loop us in.

35:38.658 --> 35:39.963
- Tip came in.

35:40.007 --> 35:41.965
- Captain Lin called.
We had to act fast.

35:42.009 --> 35:43.967
- We recovered the gun
from Yuze's office.

35:44.011 --> 35:45.404
His prints are all over it.

35:45.447 --> 35:47.145
Yuze's our shooter.

35:47.188 --> 35:49.059
- Hey, we're all on the
same team here, remember?

35:49.103 --> 35:50.931
This is a win for all of us.

35:50.974 --> 35:52.237
- Don't worry.

35:52.280 --> 35:54.500
Your squad can take
all the credit.

35:54.543 --> 35:56.458
You brought Yuze in.
You have him in custody.

35:56.502 --> 35:58.982
- There is one issue
with your victory lap.

35:59.026 --> 36:00.984
We picked up Yuze 24 hours ago.

36:01.028 --> 36:03.900
- Clearly, he paid a visit to
Mei before you picked him up.

36:03.944 --> 36:05.685
- No. Body was warm.

36:05.728 --> 36:07.121
Blood on the floor fresh.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.732
He couldn't have shot Mei.

36:09.776 --> 36:12.344
- Look, we got him.

36:12.387 --> 36:13.606
It's done.

36:13.649 --> 36:15.521
- So forget the details.
Just go for the win.

36:17.218 --> 36:18.698
- Look, stick around
for the press conference.

36:18.741 --> 36:22.484
I wanna give you guys
a special acknowledgment, yeah?

36:22.528 --> 36:24.573
- Have you notified
Stephen Lee?

36:24.617 --> 36:25.922
- His wife woke up today.

36:25.966 --> 36:27.185
He's staying with her
at the hospital.

36:29.622 --> 36:30.579
- You buying any of this?

36:30.623 --> 36:32.233
- Not for a second.

36:35.367 --> 36:38.326
- Chrysanthemums, my favorite.

36:38.370 --> 36:41.155
In Chinese culture,
they symbolize

36:41.199 --> 36:43.679
longevity and vitality.

36:43.723 --> 36:45.072
- Words to live by.

36:45.115 --> 36:46.726
- It's nice to finally
meet you, Ms. Lee.

36:46.769 --> 36:48.771
- Jennifer, please.

36:48.815 --> 36:50.382
And I can't thank you enough

36:50.425 --> 36:51.948
for all that you've done
for us.

36:51.992 --> 36:54.255
- Oh, no need for thanks.

36:54.299 --> 36:56.953
We're just happy you're okay.

36:56.997 --> 36:58.781
What's next for you two?

36:58.825 --> 37:02.350
- We will find new ways
to serve our community.

37:02.394 --> 37:06.311
My only focus right now
is getting her home.

37:06.354 --> 37:08.269
- Honey, press conference.
- Oh, yes.

37:08.313 --> 37:10.184
- Before it starts, we just
have a few questions for you,

37:10.228 --> 37:11.185
if you don't mind.

37:11.229 --> 37:12.578
- Regarding Mei Shen.

37:13.927 --> 37:15.102
- What about Mei?

37:16.930 --> 37:20.368
- I'm really sorry to tell you
this, but Mei was murdered.

37:20.412 --> 37:22.544
- What?

37:22.588 --> 37:23.893
What happened? When?

37:23.937 --> 37:26.026
- During your recovery.

37:26.069 --> 37:27.680
Now, I'm hoping you'll
be able to help us

37:27.723 --> 37:29.595
figure out who's responsible.

37:29.638 --> 37:31.249
[suspenseful music]

37:31.292 --> 37:33.555
- Maybe this isn't a good time.

37:33.599 --> 37:35.122
- No.

37:35.165 --> 37:36.732
How can I help?

37:36.776 --> 37:40.736
- Well, Mei was staying at your
shelter, and then she left.

37:40.780 --> 37:41.694
Any idea why?

37:43.696 --> 37:47.090
- She was indebted
to some scary people.

37:47.134 --> 37:48.875
She didn't wanna
bring any danger

37:48.918 --> 37:51.181
to the other girls
at the shelter.

37:51.225 --> 37:52.705
I begged her to stay.

37:54.489 --> 37:57.318
When she didn't,
I asked Michael

37:57.362 --> 37:59.407
to help her get a safe place
outside of Chinatown.

37:59.451 --> 38:01.235
- And that would
be Michael Quan.

38:01.279 --> 38:03.759
- Yeah, he's always
been there for us.

38:03.803 --> 38:05.413
It's starting.

38:05.457 --> 38:08.286
- The NYPD remains confident
that we will bring

38:08.329 --> 38:10.418
Jennifer Lee's shooter
to justice.

38:10.462 --> 38:12.899
As a personal friend
of Mr. and Mrs. Lee's,

38:12.942 --> 38:16.729
I'm here to introduce
the very fine Michael Quan.

38:16.772 --> 38:18.557
- Thank you.

38:18.600 --> 38:21.299
Hello, everyone. Um.

38:21.342 --> 38:25.390
Mr. and Mrs. Lee asked me
to speak on their behalf.

38:25.433 --> 38:29.524
Mr. Lee has decided to withdraw
from the race at this time

38:29.568 --> 38:32.788
to focus
on his wife's recovery.

38:32.832 --> 38:36.226
I have decided to honor
my friend Stephen Lee

38:36.270 --> 38:40.796
by taking his place
in the race for councilman.

38:40.840 --> 38:43.059
I will be running
on the same platform

38:43.103 --> 38:44.713
that Stephen and Jennifer

38:44.757 --> 38:48.151
have committed their lives to.
[phone buzzes]

38:48.195 --> 38:49.588
- Yeah, Jet.

38:49.631 --> 38:52.330
- I did a dive into Stephen
Lee's campaign finances.

38:52.373 --> 38:54.549
Contributions were made
by an LLC

38:54.593 --> 38:56.682
linked to an international
shipping company.

38:56.725 --> 38:58.814
That company was implicated
two years ago

38:58.858 --> 39:02.775
in a human trafficking
operation out of China.

39:02.818 --> 39:05.734
And you'll never guess who's
on the board of directors.

39:05.778 --> 39:07.432
- Michael Quan.

39:07.475 --> 39:11.044
- I promise you, I will work
as hard as I can every day.

39:11.087 --> 39:12.088
- Jet, let me get back to you.

39:12.132 --> 39:13.742
Sarge?

39:13.786 --> 39:16.266
- Yeah. Um, excuse us.

39:19.618 --> 39:21.533
- Jet.

39:21.576 --> 39:25.537
Quan financed Lee's campaign.
All of it with dirty money.

39:26.755 --> 39:29.802
He's the one
behind the trafficking.

39:29.845 --> 39:33.893
- So he's the one that needed
Jennifer Lee out of the way.

39:33.936 --> 39:35.851
- All roads lead to Quan.

39:35.895 --> 39:39.072
[tense music]

39:39.115 --> 39:40.682
- Extra security
at my home and offices,

39:40.726 --> 39:43.990
and schedule all
press appearances remotely.

39:44.033 --> 39:45.774
- Mr. Quan.

39:45.818 --> 39:48.386
Can I have a word with you?
In private?

39:48.429 --> 39:51.519
- Uh...thank you, everyone.

39:51.563 --> 39:53.303
Detective.

39:53.347 --> 39:55.262
Are you here
to endorse my campaign?

39:55.305 --> 39:59.397
- No, no, no, I'm here
to make a promise and, uh,

39:59.440 --> 40:02.704
have a heart-to-heart with you.

40:02.748 --> 40:04.271
- About what?

40:05.838 --> 40:08.406
- Well, you and I both know
that, uh, you're responsible

40:08.449 --> 40:11.147
for the attempted murder
of Jennifer Lee.

40:12.975 --> 40:15.282
That's the heart-to-heart.

40:15.325 --> 40:17.110
Here's the promise.

40:18.416 --> 40:20.896
You will go down for it.
