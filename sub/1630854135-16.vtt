largest city,

00:07.181 --> 00:09.879
the vicious and violent
members of the underworld

00:09.922 --> 00:11.489
are hunted by the detectives

00:11.533 --> 00:14.710
of the Organized Crime
Control Bureau.

00:14.753 --> 00:17.234
These are their stories.

00:19.541 --> 00:20.846
- Wow.

00:20.890 --> 00:22.370
- Hey, give me a hand.

00:22.413 --> 00:24.459
- Hey, man, I--I don't think

00:24.502 --> 00:26.678
Jet's all
into the surprise stuff.

00:26.722 --> 00:28.245
- She's gonna love it.

00:28.289 --> 00:30.508
You remember when you made
second grade detective, right?

00:30.552 --> 00:32.858
- Yeah, my wife
was eight months pregnant.

00:32.902 --> 00:36.514
She made spaghetti, and we
fell asleep on the couch.

00:36.558 --> 00:38.212
- Too low.

00:38.255 --> 00:40.257
- Hey, what'd you do
when you made second?

00:40.301 --> 00:42.085
- Got two beers
and a meatball hero

00:42.129 --> 00:44.087
and went
to my father's gravesite.

00:44.131 --> 00:46.437
You guys wanna scope out
your hiding places now

00:46.481 --> 00:48.787
so we won't have to scramble
when she gets here?

00:48.831 --> 00:51.529
- It's time for you
to have kids, bro.

00:51.573 --> 00:54.054
- Thurman here?
- No.

01:00.582 --> 01:02.062
You still coming?
You on your way?

01:02.105 --> 01:03.019
- What, to Jet's
surprise thing?

01:03.063 --> 01:04.325
Of course I'm coming.

01:04.367 --> 01:05.630

we're about to start.

it wasn't until 2:00.

You didn't get my text?

01:08.372 --> 01:10.026
- I've been on the phone
with the brass all morning.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.942

- She's coming in early.

his speech all night.

making changes.

01:33.919 --> 01:36.183
- First impressions
are everything, am I right?

on crime,

01:37.662 --> 01:40.578
take down the gangs in
Chinatown--you have my vote.

01:40.622 --> 01:42.493

practice at the mics.

01:42.537 --> 01:44.800
- Mm.
- See you down there?

01:44.843 --> 01:45.757
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

- Hey, this thing
hasn't even started yet.

01:51.720 --> 01:52.634
We're gonna
have to reschedule.

01:52.676 --> 01:54.157
- She's coming.
- Okay.

01:54.201 --> 01:56.681
I don't think we're gonna be
able to do that.

Congratulations.

wants to say something to you.

02:20.357 --> 02:21.793
Hey, you still there?

02:21.837 --> 02:24.144
- Detective Slootmaekers,
DI Thurman.

02:24.187 --> 02:26.711
Listen, I wanted
to be there in person

02:26.755 --> 02:28.539
since I'm the one responsible
for making this happen.

02:28.583 --> 02:32.195
But since I can't be,
let me say on behalf

02:32.239 --> 02:34.284

02:45.121 --> 02:46.688
- Get down here right now.

02:50.126 --> 02:52.346
- I was in the green room
when I heard the shots.

Time I got to Lee and Jennifer,

02:54.435 --> 02:56.480
the shooter was running out
through the kitchen.

02:56.524 --> 02:57.525
- You gotta be familiar
with a place

02:57.567 --> 02:59.179
to make that your exit.

02:59.222 --> 03:00.615
- Bus just got Lee's wife
to the hospital.

03:00.658 --> 03:02.660
She took two to the chest.

03:02.704 --> 03:03.618

03:03.661 --> 03:05.663
- Shaken, but he wasn't hit.

03:05.707 --> 03:07.665
- I gotta get back to 1PP
to update the brass

03:07.709 --> 03:09.754
and then stop by the hospital.

03:09.798 --> 03:14.237
Look, these are my friends,
okay?

03:14.281 --> 03:16.326
I'm depending on you.

03:18.502 --> 03:20.417
- What's Lee's team saying?

03:20.461 --> 03:22.853
- Nothing.
They're very hesitant to talk.

03:22.898 --> 03:24.682
- I tried to speak
to the kitchen staff,

03:24.726 --> 03:26.293
but no one was willing
to give a statement,

03:26.336 --> 03:28.773
but I did do a headcount after
getting the employees list.

03:28.817 --> 03:32.603
Looks like one, a Daniel Yao,
left right after the shooting.

03:32.647 --> 03:33.952
- Zip on security footage.

03:33.996 --> 03:36.172
- What does "zip" mean?
I see plenty of cameras.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.435
- Owner told me straight up
he wouldn't cooperate.

03:38.478 --> 03:41.612
Doesn't trust police.
- We can help with that.

03:41.656 --> 03:44.876
- Detective Chang, 4th
Precinct, Community Affairs.

03:44.920 --> 03:46.313
Sorry for the delay.

03:46.356 --> 03:47.836
I'll try and get you
the security footage,

03:47.879 --> 03:49.838
but I'm pretty sure
the cams are just dummies.

03:49.881 --> 03:53.276

a lot better here.

04:07.116 --> 04:09.858
So you guys wanna go get
some coffee or something?

04:09.901 --> 04:13.340

He called us in.

an Organized Crime case.

- Okay.

06:01.273 --> 06:04.233
my office received
so many threats.

06:04.276 --> 06:06.844
I never thought anything of it.

06:06.888 --> 06:08.846
That's just to be
expected, right?

06:08.890 --> 06:10.848
- Did you report any
of these threats?

06:10.892 --> 06:12.633
- Captain Lin
at the 4th Precinct

06:12.676 --> 06:15.592
was made well aware.

06:15.636 --> 06:18.682
When I was growing up
in Chinatown, these gangs,

06:18.726 --> 06:21.337

hardworking people,

my family, Jennifer's family.

06:24.209 --> 06:26.168
We all grew up terrified.

06:26.211 --> 06:29.606
It's the reason we felt so
strongly about taking them on.

06:29.650 --> 06:31.086
- What you said earlier--

06:31.129 --> 06:34.306
you barely caught
a glimpse of the shooter?

06:34.350 --> 06:36.047
Did he say anything?
- No.

06:36.091 --> 06:38.354
- Do you remember
what he was wearing?

06:38.398 --> 06:40.574
Because I have to be operating
under the assumption

06:40.617 --> 06:42.183
that you're still
a target, right?

06:42.227 --> 06:44.447
So I'm gonna assign you
a full-time security detail.

Jennifer would hate that.

to these gangs without guns.

they don't feel that way--

06:54.588 --> 06:56.024

what you're feeling

right now, Detective.

06:59.201 --> 07:00.942

All I can tell you
is that I lost my wife

how I feel

out of the press.

Stephen Lee is a front-runner.

Maybe one of his opponents
went too far?

07:34.497 --> 07:35.716
Put a hit out on him?

- Yeah, but Lee's
biggest opposition

07:37.631 --> 07:38.893
isn't another politician.

07:38.936 --> 07:40.982
It's the gangs of Chinatown.

- Probably 20 more
we don't even know about.

07:49.904 --> 07:52.602
- Yeah, but the major players
are the Black Tiger Gang,

07:52.646 --> 07:55.475
the Doyers Street Gang,
and Snakeheads.

07:55.518 --> 07:57.477
Chinatown has
a closed community,

impenetrable,

hasn't shown up yet.

08:57.711 --> 08:59.103

Daniel's last known,

09:00.714 --> 09:02.411

in the city?

Bit of history for you.

09:12.987 --> 09:15.032
Back in the day, they moved
the front door a few feet over

they deserve a clear shot."

09:21.735 --> 09:26.174
So you close my case?

community liaison officer,

09:29.046 --> 09:30.961
we're running point on this.

there had been threats made

09:32.963 --> 09:34.530
against his campaign office.

09:34.574 --> 09:35.923
Did you guys check those out?

on his back

since the day he threw his hat
in the ring for this race.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.757
- Maybe someone wants
to make good on those threats.

09:45.759 --> 09:47.064
- I'll talk to Detective Chang,

09:47.108 --> 09:48.762
