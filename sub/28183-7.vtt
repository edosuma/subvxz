00:16.750 --> 00:18.329
You're not supposed
to have that in the ring.

00:18.330 --> 00:19.579
You're not supposed
to have me out of bed

00:19.580 --> 00:22.039
at 545.
Can't have it both ways.

00:22.040 --> 00:23.249
I need someone to spar with.

00:23.250 --> 00:24.459
His name is Ted.

00:24.460 --> 00:26.169
I don't want boxing
to just be a Ted thing.

00:26.170 --> 00:28.500
Then how about making Ted
a Ted thing?

00:31.120 --> 00:32.829
Don't tell me
you're down for the count.

00:32.830 --> 00:35.169
No, I get it.

00:35.170 --> 00:38.289
Drink plenty of fluids,
read trashy magazines,

00:38.290 --> 00:41.539
I'll hand off as many
of your cases as I can.

00:41.540 --> 00:43.329
Okay.

00:43.330 --> 00:45.289
What? Just because
you like "Rocky"

00:45.290 --> 00:46.919
doesn't mean you are Rocky.

00:46.920 --> 00:48.999
Rocky would never put
kale in his raw eggs.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.789
This is brain food. Just
saying, donuts exist.

00:51.790 --> 00:53.750
And I'm sad you don't
let yourself enjoy life.

00:54.830 --> 00:55.919
What?! I can't hear you

00:55.920 --> 00:57.580
over all these antioxidants!

00:59.210 --> 01:00.619
You know, you don't
have to leave

01:00.620 --> 01:02.669
just because I'm gonna live,
like, 20 years longer than you.

01:02.670 --> 01:04.169
I have three lawyers
out with a cold.

01:04.170 --> 01:05.209
I need to get to work.

01:05.209 --> 01:06.459
Which means I need to get home.

01:06.460 --> 01:07.499
So I can get to work.

01:07.500 --> 01:09.329
It's an odd route.
I need clothes.

01:09.330 --> 01:11.039
Well, you could leave
some more clothes here.

01:11.040 --> 01:12.879
You could bring
some things to my place.

01:12.880 --> 01:14.169
And put them where?

01:14.170 --> 01:15.879
Your kitchen pantry is
in your bedroom. True.

01:15.880 --> 01:18.499
But it's also filled
with saturated fats.

01:18.500 --> 01:19.500
Mmmmmm.

01:19.501 --> 01:20.999
Mmmmmm.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.499
Longevity.

01:22.500 --> 01:25.749
Mmmmmm. Coffee.
The true story of two strangers

01:25.750 --> 01:27.079
picked to live in a house...

01:27.080 --> 01:28.249
What? "The Real World."

01:28.250 --> 01:30.289
Stop being polite,
and start getting real?

01:30.290 --> 01:32.329
I'm so sorry.
I don't understand.

01:32.330 --> 01:34.419
It's 'cause we're roommates
now... never mind.

01:34.420 --> 01:37.079
Why are you completely dressed
super-early?

01:37.080 --> 01:38.539
I have my first
press conference today.

01:38.540 --> 01:41.499
Just a little anxious.
I'm sure you'll be fine.

01:41.500 --> 01:43.829
I mean, I'm not sure.
How could I be sure?

01:43.830 --> 01:46.000
Things could go terribly,
terribly wrong.

01:46.920 --> 01:48.079
Is that what you're wearing?

01:48.080 --> 01:49.499
Yeah, why? Nothing.

01:49.500 --> 01:51.499
Just keeping it real.

01:51.500 --> 01:52.619
Do you have a suit
in your office?

01:52.620 --> 01:54.789
Yes. Then this is for you.

01:54.790 --> 01:58.039
Sarah, Brad, and Sunil
all called in sick.

01:58.040 --> 01:59.669
Sunil high-fived me yesterday.

01:59.670 --> 02:02.539
You're fine.
This place is a Petri dish.

02:02.540 --> 02:04.329
We're all going down.
Just tell yourself,

02:04.330 --> 02:05.829
you're not gonna get sick
and you won't.

02:05.830 --> 02:08.079
That's what I do.
I haven't been sick since 2009.

02:08.080 --> 02:09.878
That's not science, Sandra.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.039
I need Oregano. Who has Oregano?

02:12.040 --> 02:14.329
Let me know if you have any questions.
You want me to do

02:14.330 --> 02:16.119
a plea negotiation
before meeting the client?

02:16.120 --> 02:18.749
It's trespassing
and fishing without a license.

02:18.750 --> 02:20.039
Your client was squatting

02:20.040 --> 02:22.829
up at the Wallkill River
National Wildlife Refuge.

02:22.830 --> 02:24.169
You can negotiate now.

02:24.170 --> 02:25.879
The government won't
want to drag this out.

02:25.880 --> 02:28.249
Your negotiation is
with... Leonard Knox?

02:28.250 --> 02:30.499
So the government
will want to drag this out

02:30.500 --> 02:31.829
as long as humanly possible.

02:31.830 --> 02:34.170
Good luck.
Do my tonsils look inflamed?

02:35.670 --> 02:36.829
Don't look in there.

02:36.830 --> 02:38.710
Don't even touch that.

02:39.830 --> 02:41.169
What's with the bowtie?

02:41.170 --> 02:42.459
I'm camera-ready.

02:42.460 --> 02:44.290
Is the camera in a saloon?

02:45.460 --> 02:46.500
What the...?

02:47.830 --> 02:49.329
31 kilos of coke,

02:49.330 --> 02:51.419
$146,000 in cash

02:51.420 --> 02:53.499
from that stash house
in the Bronx.

02:53.500 --> 02:55.499
That's incredible.

02:55.500 --> 02:57.289
Is it a clip-on...?

02:57.290 --> 02:58.669
It's for the press conference...

02:58.670 --> 03:01.169
Are you announcing the arrest
of the outlaw Jesse James?

03:01.170 --> 03:02.830
The DEA raid... In Tombstone?

03:04.000 --> 03:05.249
Didn't you ever wear a bowtie?

03:05.250 --> 03:07.249
At my bar mitzvah.
Is it for your bar mitzvah?

03:07.250 --> 03:09.209
It wasn't my idea exactly.

03:09.210 --> 03:11.119
Not sure how that helps you,
but, anyway,

03:11.120 --> 03:12.709
the press conference
is postponed.

03:12.710 --> 03:14.079
The good news, though,
is that you now have time

03:14.080 --> 03:15.620
to sing with
your barbershop quartet.

03:25.500 --> 03:27.959
Thanks, guys.
You can take all this back.

03:27.960 --> 03:30.039
Except the paper evidence...
You can leave that in my office.

03:30.040 --> 03:32.289
No.

03:32.290 --> 03:33.499
No, no, no, no.

03:33.500 --> 03:35.999
George Clooney wears a bowtie.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.460
Clooney!

03:42.670 --> 03:44.169
Have a seat.

03:44.170 --> 03:45.289
And then what?

03:45.290 --> 03:46.789
We mail each other letters?

03:46.790 --> 03:48.169
That cold that's going
around your office?

03:48.170 --> 03:49.579
I plan to keep it there.

03:49.580 --> 03:51.579
I don't get sick. Neither do I.

03:51.580 --> 03:53.499
Because I'm over here.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.499
Three months' probation,
no fine.

03:55.500 --> 03:57.709
Maybe it's
the football field between us,

03:57.710 --> 03:58.879
but I think you just said...

03:58.880 --> 04:01.329
Three months' probation,
no fine.

04:01.330 --> 04:02.999
You're that desperate
to avoid a cold?

04:03.000 --> 04:04.539
Your client's indigent.

04:04.540 --> 04:05.749
He was looking
for food and shelter.

04:05.750 --> 04:06.919
He didn't mean any harm.

04:06.920 --> 04:08.209
No prison time. Nope.

04:08.210 --> 04:09.249
No fine at all.

04:09.250 --> 04:10.829
How's a homeless guy
gonna pay a fine?

04:10.830 --> 04:13.330
I was supposed to be
meeting Leonard Knox.

04:15.120 --> 04:16.999
Let me know how it goes.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.290
I touched that door.

04:21.209 --> 04:22.669
Thank you.

04:22.670 --> 04:23.919
This was nice!

04:23.920 --> 04:25.709
I'm sure he'll be grateful!

04:25.710 --> 04:27.539
So, what does it mean?

04:27.540 --> 04:29.459
It means no prison time.

04:29.460 --> 04:31.079
No fine for both the trespassing

04:31.080 --> 04:32.999
and the fishing charges.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.419
It's a good deal, Braden.

04:35.420 --> 04:37.079
I wasn't trying
to bother anyone.

04:37.080 --> 04:38.999
Yes, of course.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.329
Been up there two weeks.

04:40.330 --> 04:41.619
Just keeping to myself.

04:41.620 --> 04:42.960
Like I always do.

04:44.420 --> 04:46.459
This is just about getting
the right paperwork together.

04:46.460 --> 04:48.170
You really don't need to worry.

04:49.880 --> 04:51.619
When we tug at
a single thing in nature,

04:51.620 --> 04:54.499
we find it's attached
to the rest of the world.

04:54.500 --> 04:56.249
You know?

04:56.250 --> 04:58.829
No, I'm... I'm not
sure I follow.

04:58.830 --> 05:00.379
Give you an example.

05:00.380 --> 05:03.669
When we catch a salmon, we do it
at the end of its life cycle.

05:03.670 --> 05:05.789
Just before it's about to spawn.

05:05.790 --> 05:09.289
Humans, grizzly bears, eagles.

05:09.290 --> 05:11.379
We all find that
salmon tastes best

05:11.380 --> 05:14.539
when it's fighting its way
up the river it was born in.

05:14.540 --> 05:16.119
So we kill it.

05:16.120 --> 05:18.789
Right before it can
make a new generation.

05:18.790 --> 05:21.459
I mean, sure, it's sad. But...

05:21.460 --> 05:24.749
we nourish our generation.

05:24.750 --> 05:27.169
It's all connected.
It's... It's... It's all one.

05:27.170 --> 05:29.670
And th-that's why
I love Wallkill.

05:31.790 --> 05:34.209
You can go back to Wallkill.

05:34.210 --> 05:35.709
You just need a license.

05:35.710 --> 05:37.879
If someone threatens me,
if s-someone tugs at me,

05:37.880 --> 05:41.039
someone... someone
challenges my rights,

05:41.040 --> 05:44.959
I-I-I-I would
have to defend myself.

05:44.960 --> 05:47.419
By force, if necessary.

05:47.420 --> 05:48.580
I would have no choice.

05:50.420 --> 05:52.419
Braden.

05:52.420 --> 05:55.169
What are you talking about?

05:55.170 --> 05:56.880
I didn't want it
to end like that.

05:58.330 --> 06:00.960
You didn't want what
to end like what?

06:03.290 --> 06:04.460
Jesus will save him.

06:18.080 --> 06:19.879
- "Jesus will save him?"
- What do we know about him?

06:19.880 --> 06:21.619
Braden Walsh. 43.

06:21.620 --> 06:23.169
No family. No job. No friends.

06:23.170 --> 06:25.499
No car. Some history
of mental illness.

06:25.500 --> 06:28.749
Multiple citations
of trespassing and panhandling.

06:28.750 --> 06:29.879
Nothing particularly violent.

06:29.880 --> 06:31.329
How long has he been in custody?

06:31.330 --> 06:32.539
Seven hours.

06:32.540 --> 06:34.579
Do you think there might
be someone hurt out there?

06:34.580 --> 06:35.619
I don't know.

06:35.620 --> 06:37.789
I can call Fish and Wildlife.

06:37.790 --> 06:39.919
And say what, exactly?

06:39.920 --> 06:41.669
What if he killed someone
and they find the body

06:41.670 --> 06:42.879
because we reported it?

06:42.880 --> 06:44.249
Then he gets charged
with murder.

06:44.250 --> 06:45.619
No, he's our client.

06:45.620 --> 06:47.879
We have a duty
of confidentiality.

06:47.880 --> 06:49.169
If you think
someone might be hurt...

06:49.170 --> 06:51.039
Doesn't matter. It does matter.

06:51.040 --> 06:54.249
New York Rule of
Professional Conduct 1.6

06:54.250 --> 06:55.999
allows me to reveal
confidential information

06:56.000 --> 06:57.329
to prevent
reasonably certain death

06:57.330 --> 06:58.959
or substantial bodily harm,

06:58.960 --> 07:00.169
and I'm not reasonably certain

07:00.170 --> 07:02.169
of anything other than I have

07:02.170 --> 07:04.499
very little appetite
for salmon now.

07:04.500 --> 07:07.169
Okay. Good by me, then.

07:07.170 --> 07:10.289
At the very least, I would need
to investigate it further

07:10.290 --> 07:11.829
before disclosing anything...

07:11.830 --> 07:12.959
We can look into it.

07:12.960 --> 07:14.999
I'm not gonna investigate
my own client.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
Or we can leave it alone.
Unless I was really concerned.

07:19.380 --> 07:20.999
And I'm not.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.290
Yet.

07:24.380 --> 07:26.670
So that's it.

07:41.880 --> 07:43.379
Let's go.

07:43.380 --> 07:44.540
Yep.

07:46.170 --> 07:47.829
Nothing.

07:47.830 --> 07:49.169
You?

07:49.170 --> 07:50.289
Nothing.

07:50.290 --> 07:52.419
There's a turtle down there.

07:52.420 --> 07:54.289
Bog turtle. Really?

07:54.290 --> 07:57.379
I don't know. I think so.
I saw a sign back there.

07:57.380 --> 07:58.829
You box this morning?

07:58.830 --> 08:00.499
Yes.

08:00.500 --> 08:03.329
It was early.
Allison wanted to spar.

08:03.330 --> 08:05.830
It's cool.
Glad you got out there.

08:07.880 --> 08:09.710
Where exactly was he arrested?

08:11.330 --> 08:13.249
Behind those trees.
He made a little camp,

08:13.250 --> 08:15.459
but I circled that
entire perimeter. Twice.

08:15.460 --> 08:17.789
No clothes. No blood.
No drag marks.

08:17.790 --> 08:19.619
Can you not say
"drag marks," please?

08:19.620 --> 08:21.040
There's nothing there.

08:22.380 --> 08:24.289
Okay. We looked.

08:24.290 --> 08:25.459
That is what we did.

08:25.460 --> 08:26.999
We looked.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.619
Not exactly a,
professional search.

08:29.620 --> 08:31.119
What would they
have done differently?

08:31.120 --> 08:32.789
Well, for example, they might
not have just stood

08:32.789 --> 08:34.999
at the edge of the lake
and stared at bog turtles.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.828
No, I covered that entire area.

08:36.830 --> 08:38.458
I'm just saying if you want
to have confidence

08:38.460 --> 08:40.078
that there's no one here...
No one's here.

08:40.080 --> 08:41.330
I am confident.

08:43.380 --> 08:45.789
Hello!

08:45.790 --> 08:47.960
Hello!

08:51.460 --> 08:52.959
What was that?

08:52.960 --> 08:55.669
An echo. I think.

08:55.670 --> 08:57.379
No one's here. We looked.

08:57.380 --> 08:59.499
There's nothing here.

08:59.500 --> 09:01.329
Braden is a messed-up guy.

09:01.330 --> 09:04.169
He was talking about
grizzly bears.

09:04.170 --> 09:05.829
You good?

09:05.830 --> 09:07.250
Yeah, I'm good.

09:08.670 --> 09:10.040
Let's go enter that plea.

09:37.040 --> 09:38.789
You know what?
It's good that Roger

09:38.790 --> 09:40.379
postponed my press conference.

09:40.380 --> 09:42.829
I've been digging deeper into
the DEA report, and there are

09:42.830 --> 09:44.999
at least four additional charges
I can bring against...

09:45.000 --> 09:46.249
Boo-Boo!

09:46.250 --> 09:48.619
Yogi Bear's little sidekick.
What?

09:48.620 --> 09:50.539
That's who you remind me of.
With the bowtie.

09:50.540 --> 09:53.169
It's been bothering me all day.

09:53.170 --> 09:54.999
I take that as a compliment.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.329
Up to you.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.419
I'm gonna work from home.

09:58.420 --> 10:00.540
I'll let everyone know.

10:05.170 --> 10:06.999
"Up to you."

10:07.000 --> 10:08.210
"I'll let everyone know."

10:11.500 --> 10:13.380
This woman I work with...

10:17.380 --> 10:19.880
No. Her name is Kate.

10:22.380 --> 10:23.500
Ha, ha, ha.

10:52.580 --> 10:54.329
Big mistake. What?

10:54.330 --> 10:56.539
The tie. I know you want me
to be polite...

10:56.540 --> 10:58.919
We have to get off this train.
Yeah, in, like, six stops.

10:58.920 --> 11:00.419
No, like, now. Just take it off.

11:00.420 --> 11:01.709
The tie is not the problem.

11:01.710 --> 11:03.749
The tie is the problem.
Listen to me...

11:03.750 --> 11:05.669
I get it.
Everybody has his own style...

11:05.670 --> 11:10.960
I have a brick
of cocaine in my bag!

11:25.210 --> 11:26.959
You have a brick of cocaine
in your bag!

11:26.960 --> 11:28.999
Quiet!

11:29.000 --> 11:31.039
You have a brick
of cocaine in your bag!

11:31.040 --> 11:32.879
The DEA must've mixed up
the evidence I asked for.

11:32.880 --> 11:34.169
They're gonna think I stole it.

11:34.170 --> 11:36.329
If it makes you feel any better,
this happens all the time.

11:36.330 --> 11:37.749
Really? Of course not.

11:37.750 --> 11:39.289
Nobody accidentally leaves work

11:39.290 --> 11:41.079
with a brick of cocaine.

11:41.080 --> 11:42.379
Except drug lords.

11:42.380 --> 11:44.329
My career is over.

11:44.330 --> 11:46.209
I'm going to prison.

11:46.210 --> 11:48.329
I'm never gonna
see my family again.

11:48.330 --> 11:49.789
I'm never gonna
see the ocean again.

11:49.790 --> 11:51.669
I'll never go to a movie theater
or the theater theater...

11:51.670 --> 11:53.999
I'm gonna get scurvy.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.999
There's no fruit in jail, Jay.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.289
Breathe.

11:58.290 --> 11:59.879
It's going to be okay.

11:59.880 --> 12:01.749
How often do you actually
go to the ocean?

12:01.750 --> 12:03.619
I have a brick of cocaine in my bag!
Quiet!

12:03.620 --> 12:05.419
I have a brick
of cocaine in my bag!

12:05.420 --> 12:08.419
Calm down. Nobody's gonna
believe you stole it,

12:08.420 --> 12:11.749
especially if you walk it
back to the DEA right now.

12:11.750 --> 12:12.959
You really think
it's gonna be fine?

12:12.960 --> 12:14.709
Yes.

12:14.710 --> 12:16.289
Now, can I say for sure?
How can I say for sure?

12:16.290 --> 12:18.209
Stop! It's gonna be fine!

12:18.210 --> 12:19.620
I'll even walk with you.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.289
Thanks, man.

12:22.290 --> 12:23.959
We're roommates.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.499
This isn't your problem.

12:25.500 --> 12:26.880
It's our problem.

12:32.170 --> 12:33.710
Dude, you've got a problem.

12:37.080 --> 12:39.079
- Did you get a good look at him?
- I didn't see anything.

12:39.080 --> 12:40.499
Except the back of his head.

12:40.500 --> 12:41.789
And your career. And your life.
Circling a toilet bowl.

12:41.790 --> 12:43.999
I'm going to prison. I'm never
gonna see my family again.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.829
I'm never gonna see the ocean again.
Stop it. Do not go there.

12:45.830 --> 12:47.459
There's nowhere else to go.

12:47.460 --> 12:50.039
If I tell Roger, I'm fired,
and then I'm arrested.

12:50.040 --> 12:52.879
If I tell the DEA, I'm arrested,
and then I'm fired.

12:52.880 --> 12:54.459
Are we rooting for one
over the other?

12:54.460 --> 12:56.289
There's no way the government
buys this story.

12:56.290 --> 12:57.499
I'm in it, and I don't buy it.

12:57.500 --> 12:59.579
Look, I was there.

12:59.580 --> 13:01.420
I'm a very credible witness.

13:02.670 --> 13:03.749
You'll tell them it was stolen?

13:03.750 --> 13:04.919
Right in front of my eyes.

13:04.920 --> 13:06.999
And I took the cocaine
home by accident.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.329
Well...

13:08.330 --> 13:09.539
I wasn't there for that part.

13:09.540 --> 13:10.829
I don't know if that's true.

13:10.830 --> 13:12.579
I was supposed
to be on TV today.

13:12.580 --> 13:13.999
Now I'm basically a fugitive.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.789
Listen. The person who stole
your bag

13:16.790 --> 13:20.749
had no idea he was stealing
a kilo of DEA-tagged cocaine.

13:20.750 --> 13:22.619
And probably wants
no part of it.

13:22.620 --> 13:25.789
Odds are he'll try to offload it
quickly, all at once,

13:25.790 --> 13:29.459
which means there's bound
to be talk on the streets.

13:29.460 --> 13:31.749
Okay. Cool.

13:31.750 --> 13:35.379
Let's get out there and
hit the cocaine streets.

13:35.380 --> 13:37.959
No, not you.

13:37.960 --> 13:39.329
Not me.

13:39.330 --> 13:40.500
Who?

13:44.460 --> 13:46.669
Hey, man.

13:46.670 --> 13:48.919
Hey. How's it going?

13:48.920 --> 13:51.169
Good.

13:51.170 --> 13:53.289
Good.

13:53.290 --> 13:54.329
Great.

13:54.330 --> 13:56.119
Can I help you with something?

13:56.120 --> 13:58.709
No. Just dropping by to say hey.

13:58.710 --> 14:00.499
Okay.

14:00.500 --> 14:02.579
But as long as I'm here,
quick question for you

14:02.580 --> 14:04.619
Have you heard anything about
someone stealing

14:04.620 --> 14:08.209
a DEA-tagged brick of cocaine?

14:08.210 --> 14:09.959
What case is this for?

14:09.960 --> 14:11.329
No case.

14:11.330 --> 14:13.539
Just asking for a friend.

14:13.540 --> 14:15.919
Your friend stole DEA cocaine?
Not exactly...

14:15.920 --> 14:17.709
Someone stole
your friend's DEA cocaine.

14:17.710 --> 14:18.959
"Friend" is too strong a word.

14:18.960 --> 14:20.169
It's your word. It's too strong.

14:20.170 --> 14:21.379
I know him. I met him.

14:21.380 --> 14:22.709
I don't even really remember
what he looks like,

14:22.710 --> 14:24.379
except I think
he wears a bowtie.

14:24.380 --> 14:27.209
Anyway, I figure
an amount that big,

14:27.210 --> 14:29.119
and tagged by the government,

14:29.120 --> 14:32.499
if there's any "chatter"
or "static,"

14:32.500 --> 14:33.829
talk on the streets...?

14:33.830 --> 14:35.999
Dude, anyone who chatters
on the street

14:36.000 --> 14:38.169
about a distribution quantity
of missing coke

14:38.170 --> 14:41.579
is looking to get
his throat slit.

14:41.580 --> 14:43.879
So, unless you got
a Kevlar body suit

14:43.880 --> 14:46.209
and a tactical squad
ten men strong,

14:46.210 --> 14:48.830
I would stop asking questions.

14:51.670 --> 14:54.169
Anything else I can
help you with?

14:54.170 --> 14:56.290
No. Mainly I was just
coming by to say hey.

15:00.920 --> 15:02.329
The Judge is going to ask you
if you understand

15:02.330 --> 15:04.119
the charges and
your rights. Okay?

15:04.120 --> 15:06.380
Just answer his questions
"yes" or "no."

15:07.830 --> 15:09.619
Not one more word.

15:09.620 --> 15:11.249
Got it?

15:11.250 --> 15:12.579
Yes.

15:12.580 --> 15:15.119
All rise.

15:15.120 --> 15:17.829
Mr. Knox. Ms. Bell.

15:17.830 --> 15:19.249
Is your client ready to begin?

15:19.250 --> 15:21.169
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Mr. Walsh, I understand

15:21.170 --> 15:25.499
you're ready to plead guilty to
one count of criminal trespass

15:25.500 --> 15:27.209
and one count of fishing
without a permit

15:27.210 --> 15:30.329
up at the Wallkill River
National Wildlife Refuge.

15:30.330 --> 15:32.329
Is that correct? Yes.

15:32.330 --> 15:34.249
Do you understand that by
pleading guilty today,

15:34.250 --> 15:36.999
you give up your right to
a trial by a jury of your peers,

15:37.000 --> 15:38.789
as well as your right
to have the government prove

15:38.790 --> 15:40.709
its case beyond
a reasonable doubt?

15:40.710 --> 15:42.539
Yes.

15:42.540 --> 15:45.210
Why don't you tell me in
your own words what you did.

15:51.540 --> 15:54.999
Judge, I-I made a camp up
at Wallkill.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.289
Did some fishing there.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.670
I like to fish.
I like to hunt, too.

16:04.960 --> 16:07.170
Yes. Y-You can go on, sir.

16:09.500 --> 16:11.499
If I catch a salmon
before it can spawn,

16:11.500 --> 16:13.879
and as sad as that may
be... Your Honor...

16:13.880 --> 16:15.419
Is there a problem, Ms. Bell?

16:15.420 --> 16:17.959
No, Your Honor, if I could
have just a minute...

16:17.960 --> 16:20.419
Braden, it is
important that you only talk

16:20.420 --> 16:22.290
about what happened
with the fishing.

16:24.250 --> 16:27.749
Mr. Walsh, I just need to hear
in your own words

16:27.750 --> 16:29.829
what you're pleading guilty to.

16:29.830 --> 16:32.579
I don't need anything else. Yes.

16:32.580 --> 16:34.499
I spent some time
up at Wallkill.

16:34.500 --> 16:36.539
Where were you in the refuge?

16:36.540 --> 16:38.830
Where was I, or where is he?

16:40.330 --> 16:41.749
What?

16:41.750 --> 16:44.749
I do believe that if you tug
at a single thing in nature,

16:44.750 --> 16:46.169
you find it's attached
to the rest...

16:46.170 --> 16:47.829
- Your Honor...
- Ms. Bell,

16:47.830 --> 16:49.459
if there's no factual basis

16:49.460 --> 16:52.209
for a guilty plea,
then I have to reject this deal,

16:52.210 --> 16:53.999
and we'll have to proceed
to set a trial date.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.379
I understand, Your Honor. I do.

16:55.380 --> 16:57.329
I think we're prepared
to go forward.

16:57.330 --> 16:59.850
If I could just have a few more
minutes, and we could discuss...

17:01.170 --> 17:03.119
- Ms. Bell?
- I'm sorry.

17:03.120 --> 17:05.539
I am sorry. I'm sorry.

17:05.540 --> 17:07.039
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

17:07.040 --> 17:09.419
Enough, sir. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

17:09.420 --> 17:11.789
Has he said anything
more specific? No.

17:11.790 --> 17:12.959
A name...? No.

17:12.960 --> 17:15.500
How certain do you feel
that someone is in danger?

17:16.500 --> 17:17.829
I don't know. Sandra...

17:17.829 --> 17:20.499
I don't know! I-I-I don't know
if any of it is real,

17:20.500 --> 17:22.419
if it means anything.

17:22.420 --> 17:23.999
If you do know anything else,

17:24.000 --> 17:25.920
you can report this, Sandra.

17:27.119 --> 17:29.080
I know, but...

17:30.670 --> 17:32.879
What? Federal Wildlife
Officer John Brower

17:32.880 --> 17:34.379
was just reported missing
at Wallkill.

17:34.380 --> 17:36.579
Hasn't been seen since
the night of Braden's arrest.

17:36.580 --> 17:38.749
- How long has that been?
- 26 hours.

17:38.750 --> 17:40.829
How did you hear about this?

17:40.830 --> 17:42.289
Fish and Wildlife Service.

17:42.290 --> 17:43.999
But FBI is on it now, too.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.330
Which means they'll put this
together across the street.

17:53.080 --> 17:54.210
I think they already have.

17:57.580 --> 18:00.119
We want to work this out cooperatively.
You're in our office.

18:00.120 --> 18:01.209
Time is of the essence.
You could've called.

18:01.210 --> 18:02.919
You want to work
what out cooperatively?

18:02.920 --> 18:04.539
What do you want?
Does Braden Walsh know

18:04.540 --> 18:06.379
anything about the disappearance
of John Brower?

18:06.380 --> 18:08.619
She can't answer that.
You know she can't answer that.

18:08.620 --> 18:10.619
She can if she thinks
he's alive.

18:10.620 --> 18:12.959
What makes you think
she thinks he's alive?

18:12.960 --> 18:14.829
Braden spoke about him
in the present tense...

18:14.830 --> 18:16.960
You don't know who
he was speaking about...

18:19.580 --> 18:21.249
He's been gone for 27 hours.

18:21.250 --> 18:23.999
If he's alive, and
if she knows anything...

18:24.000 --> 18:25.919
She doesn't have
anything to say.

18:25.920 --> 18:27.379
You probably
should've just called.

18:27.380 --> 18:28.539
Saved yourself a trip.

18:28.540 --> 18:30.420
No, because then I couldn't
have given you this.

18:33.460 --> 18:35.709
You're subpoenaing Sandra? Yes.

18:35.710 --> 18:37.329
Roger... I don't have a choice.

18:37.330 --> 18:39.419
Of course you have a choice.
This guy could die.

18:39.420 --> 18:41.249
You don't even know
if he's alive.

18:41.250 --> 18:42.879
You don't know
if his disappearance

18:42.880 --> 18:44.499
has anything
to do with Braden Walsh.

18:44.500 --> 18:46.079
She knows. You don't know that.

18:46.080 --> 18:48.499
Well, the only way we're gonna find
out is by getting her to talk...

18:48.500 --> 18:50.749
Any communication between
Braden Walsh and Sandra

18:50.750 --> 18:53.249
is privileged. Not if it's
part of a crime, or a fraud...

18:53.250 --> 18:55.329
You have no evidence
of that... none.

18:55.330 --> 18:58.829
Look, Sandra can choose
to divulge whatever she knows

18:58.830 --> 19:01.329
if she's reasonably certain
his life is in danger.

19:01.330 --> 19:03.209
But that's her choice.

19:03.210 --> 19:05.579
For you to try and
force it out of her

19:05.580 --> 19:08.829
on the flimsy and, frankly,
offensive allegation

19:08.830 --> 19:10.289
that she might be complicit...

19:10.290 --> 19:12.209
I didn't say that. That's what
the crime-fraud exception

19:12.210 --> 19:14.170
to the attorney-client
privilege is...

19:19.420 --> 19:21.000
Your parents fight growing up?

19:22.290 --> 19:24.120
My mom died when I was 8.

19:25.790 --> 19:27.170
I'm sorry.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.330
You?

19:34.210 --> 19:35.750
Never met my dad.

19:37.170 --> 19:39.119
I'm sorry.

19:39.120 --> 19:40.880
I'm told I didn't miss much.

19:49.790 --> 19:52.169
Definitely getting sick now.

19:52.170 --> 19:54.000
No way around it.

19:57.710 --> 19:59.380
Knox. Let's go.

20:03.790 --> 20:05.879
They're subpoenaing you. What?

20:05.880 --> 20:08.289
The U.S. Attorney's Office wants
all the notes and records

20:08.290 --> 20:09.829
from your conversations
with Braden Walsh.

20:09.830 --> 20:12.379
I can't do that. We'll move to quash it.
Right now.

20:12.380 --> 20:15.170
But it doesn't matter.
You don't know anything anyway.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.500
That's not true.

20:21.670 --> 20:22.790
What are you talking about?

20:24.620 --> 20:27.169
I have a map.

20:27.170 --> 20:28.880
He drew me a map.

20:35.420 --> 20:37.380
You're in serious trouble. Dude.

20:41.290 --> 20:42.879
What did he say? Okay.

20:42.880 --> 20:44.119
I just want to make sure
I get this right.

20:44.120 --> 20:47.419
Anyone who asks
about that much missing coke

20:47.420 --> 20:49.620
could get his throat slit.

20:50.880 --> 20:52.879
Repeating it back now,
it doesn't seem super helpful.

20:52.880 --> 20:54.619
No. It's not!

20:54.620 --> 20:57.329
You know the street value
of that brick of cocaine?

20:57.330 --> 20:58.540
$25,000.

20:59.920 --> 21:02.360
You probably don't want that on
your search history right now.

21:04.250 --> 21:05.669
What is our plan?

21:05.670 --> 21:08.079
Other than breaking rocks in
the hot sun for... possession.

21:08.080 --> 21:09.919
Or non-possession.
Or whatever this is.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.669
Breaking rocks... that's not
really a thing anymore.

21:11.670 --> 21:13.540
There's actually a lot
of arts and crafts now.

21:14.500 --> 21:16.039
We don't have a plan.

21:16.040 --> 21:18.039
This is your problem.

21:18.040 --> 21:20.249
I've gotten way too involved
in this already.

21:20.250 --> 21:21.669
The word is "accomplice"...

21:21.670 --> 21:22.999
Because I talked to a guy
in my office?

21:23.000 --> 21:24.500
It's not the crime,
it's the coverup.

21:29.330 --> 21:31.209
That's messed up. I'm sorry.

21:31.210 --> 21:33.119
I can't be part of this.

21:33.120 --> 21:34.120
I'm out.

21:34.121 --> 21:35.879
We're roommates.
Yeah, roommates...

21:35.880 --> 21:37.210
Not cellmates.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.459
Your Honor, Ms. Bell
has knowledge of a crime

21:41.460 --> 21:42.619
that is happening now...

21:42.620 --> 21:45.459
A Federal Wildlife Officer
who is missing now...

21:45.460 --> 21:49.499
There is no evidence that
there is even a crime right now,

21:49.500 --> 21:51.829
nor is there any evidence
that Ms. Bell

21:51.830 --> 21:54.039
has any knowledge
of the purported crime.

21:54.040 --> 21:56.829
Even if there were
evidence of those things,

21:56.830 --> 21:58.539
that would not be enough
to order Ms. Bell

21:58.540 --> 22:00.209
to comply with the subpoena

22:00.210 --> 22:02.119
and break attorney-client
privilege...

22:02.120 --> 22:04.919
You're arguing that this falls
under the crime-fraud exception.

22:04.920 --> 22:06.289
- We are, Your Honor.
- Well, that would mean

22:06.290 --> 22:08.999
that Mr. Walsh intended
to further this alleged crime

22:09.000 --> 22:10.829
by communicating with Ms. Bell.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.499
What evidence do you have
of that?

22:12.500 --> 22:14.419
We can't say for certain.

22:14.420 --> 22:16.039
You don't need
to say for certain.

22:16.040 --> 22:17.329
But you need probable cause.

22:17.330 --> 22:19.709
Because we don't know the
substance of the communications,

22:19.710 --> 22:21.919
we can't say,
but what we do know

22:21.920 --> 22:23.749
is that a Federal Wildlife
Officer is missing,

22:23.750 --> 22:25.209
that Mr. Walsh was arrested

22:25.210 --> 22:27.999
in the exact same place
the Officer was last seen,

22:28.000 --> 22:29.619
and that Mr. Walsh
has been referring to someone

22:29.620 --> 22:32.249
we believe to be the missing
Officer in the present tense

22:32.250 --> 22:34.040
as if he may be alive.

22:36.040 --> 22:38.169
Under Zolin,
the court only needs

22:38.170 --> 22:39.749
a reasonable good-faith belief

22:39.750 --> 22:41.829
that a review of the evidence
in chambers

22:41.830 --> 22:43.209
could decide the matter.

22:43.210 --> 22:46.619
We're just asking
for you to give us that.

22:46.620 --> 22:48.000
Look at what she has.

23:05.380 --> 23:07.169
He drew this.

23:07.170 --> 23:08.999
Yes.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.459
When?

23:10.460 --> 23:12.829
During the hearing?

23:12.830 --> 23:14.619
Here. In the courtroom.

23:14.620 --> 23:15.919
Yes.

23:15.920 --> 23:19.169
Has he said whether he believes
the Officer's alive?

23:19.170 --> 23:20.999
No.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.959
Do you believe that he is?

23:23.960 --> 23:25.290
I don't know.

23:29.330 --> 23:32.079
I'm not going to order you
to turn this over.

23:32.080 --> 23:34.169
I don't see any evidence
in anything you've said,

23:34.170 --> 23:35.829
or anything I've seen here,

23:35.830 --> 23:37.619
that this information
was given to you

23:37.620 --> 23:41.499
with the intent to further
any crime or fraud.

23:41.500 --> 23:44.789
The crime-fraud exception
to the attorney-client privilege

23:44.790 --> 23:46.120
does not apply.

23:48.040 --> 23:50.669
Now...

23:50.670 --> 23:55.079
you still have the option
to turn this over.

23:55.080 --> 23:57.789
But that is your call, Ms. Bell.

23:57.790 --> 24:00.380
I know.

24:03.710 --> 24:05.210
I would not want
to be you right now.

24:16.170 --> 24:17.920
You could start for the Knicks.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.119
What are you doing?

24:21.120 --> 24:22.789
Just had my hearing.

24:22.790 --> 24:24.539
Getting ready to head home.
Really?

24:24.540 --> 24:26.829
'Cause you look like you're
actively not heading home.

24:26.830 --> 24:28.619
What? No. No. See?

24:28.620 --> 24:31.829
Here I am. Packing up.
Heading home.

24:31.830 --> 24:33.919
Home, sweet home.

24:33.920 --> 24:35.999
How's the new living situation?

24:36.000 --> 24:37.579
Fine?

24:37.580 --> 24:38.500
Weird.

24:38.501 --> 24:40.879
There's issues.

24:40.880 --> 24:43.039
It's hard living with
other people's messes.

24:43.040 --> 24:45.499
Floss in the sink?
Towels on the floor?

24:45.500 --> 24:48.079
Kinda messier than that.

24:48.080 --> 24:49.830
I'm honestly not sure
it's working out.

24:51.540 --> 24:54.999
I moved out of my parents' house
when I was 17.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.209
Got a job waiting tables
in a Greek place

24:57.210 --> 24:59.879
owned by, I am still sure,

24:59.880 --> 25:03.169
the oldest man
to ever walk upright.

25:03.170 --> 25:04.999
He set me up with
his great-grand-daughter,

25:05.000 --> 25:07.709
who had an extra room,
so she was my first roommate.

25:07.710 --> 25:09.329
Daphne was nuts.

25:09.330 --> 25:12.329
She tap danced. In the apartment!
At 300 A.M.

25:12.330 --> 25:14.999
She brought home
every stray she found,

25:15.000 --> 25:17.209
dogs, cats, two raccoons.

25:17.210 --> 25:18.830
She drove me crazy.

25:20.250 --> 25:25.079
But she's the one that got me
to start night school.

25:25.080 --> 25:28.580
She paid my rent more times
than I can count.

25:31.080 --> 25:34.459
She slept in my bed with me

25:34.460 --> 25:36.040
the night my mother died.

25:38.380 --> 25:40.330
Two raccoons?

25:43.540 --> 25:46.329
When you're young in New York,

25:46.330 --> 25:48.419
roommates are your family.

25:48.420 --> 25:51.579
They drive you crazy.

25:51.580 --> 25:55.079
They share every moment
of your life with you.

25:55.080 --> 25:57.169
But if you do it right,

25:57.170 --> 25:59.749
they'll have your back forever.

25:59.750 --> 26:01.959
So go home.

26:01.960 --> 26:03.670
Do it right.

26:12.330 --> 26:13.919
I was wrong.

26:13.920 --> 26:15.419
This isn't your problem.

26:15.420 --> 26:17.959
It's our problem. You and me.

26:17.960 --> 26:19.999
I'm calling Roger and
telling him everything.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.169
Everything? Including my name?

26:22.170 --> 26:24.419
Want to know the real problem?
That Roger barely knows my name,

26:24.420 --> 26:26.669
and this is the absolute
worst way for him to learn it?

26:26.670 --> 26:28.499
The real problem is that
I didn't want to man up

26:28.500 --> 26:30.170
and tell Roger on day one.

26:31.500 --> 26:33.379
My mom always said,
If you tell the truth,

26:33.380 --> 26:35.330
you don't have
to remember a thing.

26:36.620 --> 26:38.079
That's actually Mark Twain.

26:38.080 --> 26:39.329
Whatever. The point is...

26:39.330 --> 26:40.499
That your mom lied
about the truth?

26:40.500 --> 26:42.289
It doesn't matter who said it.

26:42.290 --> 26:45.039
I used to believe it.
I used to live it.

26:45.040 --> 26:47.079
I got upset
when vending machines

26:47.080 --> 26:48.669
gave me too much change.

26:48.670 --> 26:50.539
Then I became a lawyer.

26:50.540 --> 26:53.669
A professional withholder.

26:53.670 --> 26:55.579
A full-time tactician

26:55.580 --> 26:57.210
who has to remember everything.

26:58.670 --> 27:00.210
Is that who I want to be?

27:02.380 --> 27:05.379
Do I ever get to be me again?

27:05.380 --> 27:07.119
You do.

27:07.120 --> 27:09.169
When you call Roger Gunn.

27:09.170 --> 27:11.669
And he will buy your story.

27:11.670 --> 27:14.619
Our story.

27:14.620 --> 27:15.880
I got you.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.709
Hi, this is Seth Oliver
for Roger.

27:24.710 --> 27:26.330
Thank you.

27:41.670 --> 27:44.079
Yes. Your address was
on a piece of mail.

27:44.080 --> 27:45.749
What? In your bag, dude.

27:45.750 --> 27:48.119
I snaked your bag.

27:48.120 --> 27:49.880
Can you open the door, please?

27:52.960 --> 27:54.499
Do you want me to leave
the coke on the mat,

27:54.500 --> 27:55.960
or do you want to let me in?

27:57.250 --> 27:59.169
Aight. Seth.

27:59.170 --> 28:00.670
Feel like I know you, man.

28:02.170 --> 28:04.379
Anyways, I'm not a drug dealer.

28:04.380 --> 28:06.379
I've taken some stuff,
but I'm not a drug dealer.

28:06.380 --> 28:07.880
- Who is that?
- No one.

28:09.420 --> 28:11.289
Jay. Jay Simmons.

28:11.290 --> 28:14.459
If I give you this bag back,
we good?

28:14.460 --> 28:16.879
You're gonna give me the bag back? If
you forget it ever went missing...

28:16.880 --> 28:19.499
Yes. This never happened.

28:19.500 --> 28:21.789
I've forgotten it already.

28:21.790 --> 28:22.920
I promise.

28:37.460 --> 28:40.919
- Holy...
- Unbelievable!

28:40.920 --> 28:42.000
Check it! Check it!

28:47.710 --> 28:48.829
Yes! Whoo!

28:48.830 --> 28:50.619
Yes! Yeah!

28:50.620 --> 28:52.080
Whoo! Come on.

28:54.670 --> 28:56.169
Yes!

28:56.170 --> 28:57.289
Ooh!

28:57.290 --> 28:58.709
Oliver?

28:58.710 --> 29:00.249
Oliver?

29:00.250 --> 29:01.329
Oliver?

29:01.330 --> 29:02.670
Oliver?

29:15.830 --> 29:17.829
Anything?

29:17.830 --> 29:19.829
No.

29:19.830 --> 29:22.169
You're her best friend.
Should we talk to her?

29:22.170 --> 29:24.620
It depends on what we'd say.
What would you say?

29:26.960 --> 29:28.919
I would...

29:28.920 --> 29:30.079
turn it over.

29:30.080 --> 29:32.709
Even if it means
your client goes to prison?

29:32.710 --> 29:35.289
I couldn't live
with myself otherwise.

29:35.290 --> 29:36.379
Maybe it's selfish...

29:36.380 --> 29:38.119
Not selfish.

29:38.120 --> 29:40.379
Human. Prison is hell.

29:40.380 --> 29:42.459
I wouldn't wish it on anybody.

29:42.460 --> 29:45.170
But no one should die
before their time.

29:49.420 --> 29:52.669
I got into this job
because I wanted to protect

29:52.670 --> 29:55.419
the most vulnerable people
in our society.

29:55.420 --> 29:56.959
And no matter what
their alleged crimes,

29:56.960 --> 29:59.959
those are the people facing
the power of the state.

29:59.960 --> 30:02.499
If it turns out the Braden
is charged with murder,

30:02.500 --> 30:04.209
or anything,
I'd happily defend him.

30:04.210 --> 30:05.709
But right now,

30:05.710 --> 30:08.619
the most vulnerable person

30:08.620 --> 30:10.080
is that Officer.

30:41.830 --> 30:43.419
Thanks for meeting me.

30:43.420 --> 30:45.000
I came for the pretzel.

30:46.750 --> 30:48.499
I need advice.

30:48.500 --> 30:50.459
From me? Yes.

30:50.460 --> 30:51.830
N-No. Kind of.

30:53.460 --> 30:55.209
It's a hypothetical situation.

30:55.210 --> 30:56.959
So you need hypothetical advice?

30:56.960 --> 30:59.419
Yes. Should I be taking notes?

30:59.420 --> 31:00.880
No. Definitely not.

31:02.170 --> 31:03.709
Okay.

31:03.710 --> 31:05.499
What is it?

31:05.500 --> 31:07.999
Let's say...

31:08.000 --> 31:10.709
I have a client who might
have harmed someone.

31:10.710 --> 31:13.460
And that person might
still be at risk.

31:14.750 --> 31:16.539
Do I break confidentiality
and report it

31:16.540 --> 31:18.920
if I know it could
harm my client?

31:21.670 --> 31:23.620
Hypothetically? Hypothetically.

31:25.580 --> 31:27.290
It's your call.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.709
Everybody keeps telling me that.

31:30.710 --> 31:32.829
I know that. I-I don't know
what call to make.

31:32.830 --> 31:33.919
You know what?
Give me my pretzel back.

31:33.920 --> 31:36.830
I mean it's your call, Sandra.

31:38.750 --> 31:42.079
D-Did you ever play
board games as a kid?

31:42.080 --> 31:44.119
Yes. We probably
played the same ones.

31:44.120 --> 31:46.039
Mouse Trap. Monopoly. Clue.

31:46.040 --> 31:48.789
I would memorize the rules.
I would internalize them.

31:48.790 --> 31:51.249
I would become the rules.

31:51.250 --> 31:54.169
I could be greedy.
I could be aggressive.

31:54.170 --> 31:56.999
I could be
ruthlessly competitive.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.419
I could be everything
I wasn't in life

32:00.420 --> 32:01.579
because it wasn't really me.

32:01.580 --> 32:04.829
I was just playing by the rules.

32:04.830 --> 32:06.499
I haven't heard of Mouse Trap,

32:06.500 --> 32:08.669
but I could totally beat you
at Monopoly. And Clue.

32:08.670 --> 32:10.539
I would destroy you.
Anyway, we all have

32:10.540 --> 32:13.999
such distinct roles
in this system...

32:14.000 --> 32:16.669
Prosecutors, defenders, judges,

32:16.670 --> 32:17.999
Tina.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.459
And every role has such
a distinct set of rules.

32:21.460 --> 32:24.119
Those roles are
so narrowly drawn,

32:24.120 --> 32:26.709
it can take morality
out of the equation.

32:26.710 --> 32:28.419
It can take humanity
out of the equation.

32:28.420 --> 32:29.999
And that is a good thing.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.169
We focus on the facts.
On the law.

32:33.170 --> 32:37.460
Not on flawed, fragile emotions.

32:38.920 --> 32:42.379
But there are rare situations...

32:42.380 --> 32:44.829
Hypothetical situations...

32:44.830 --> 32:46.789
Where you don't have to be

32:46.790 --> 32:50.379
Sandra the ferocious
and unyielding defender.

32:50.380 --> 32:53.079
You can be Sandra the person.

32:53.080 --> 32:54.829
If you think someone is at risk,

32:54.830 --> 32:58.419
you are allowed
to step outside your role.

32:58.420 --> 33:03.379
You are allowed to stop
playing by the rules.

33:03.380 --> 33:06.880
There is a rule that allows us
not to play by the rules.

33:08.330 --> 33:11.169
Only lawyers could come up
with something like that.

33:11.170 --> 33:13.879
Forget about
Sandra the defender.

33:13.880 --> 33:15.669
What about Sandra the person?

33:15.670 --> 33:17.749
It's your call.

33:17.750 --> 33:19.290
Sandra.

33:50.290 --> 33:51.709
You been here all night?

33:51.710 --> 33:53.749
Yes. Sandra...

33:53.750 --> 33:55.459
I couldn't leave.

33:55.460 --> 33:58.420
They're out there right now.
Searching.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.329
Middle of the night
impulse purchase.

34:04.330 --> 34:06.920
Hard to play by myself, though.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.789
Press conference is back on.

34:27.790 --> 34:30.668
Okay. The DEA is coming up
to deliver the evidence.

34:30.670 --> 34:31.829
I'll be here.

34:31.830 --> 34:34.168
They said some was missing.

34:34.170 --> 34:36.168
You know anything about that?

34:36.170 --> 34:37.750
No. Where are the files?

34:39.330 --> 34:40.710
Right there.

34:47.420 --> 34:49.458
My God. Is that cocaine?

34:49.460 --> 34:50.579
Yes.

34:50.580 --> 34:52.748
That is a huge screwup,
isn't it?

34:52.750 --> 34:54.500
Has this been here
the whole time?

34:56.620 --> 34:57.749
No.

34:57.750 --> 34:59.329
No? What are you talking about?

34:59.330 --> 35:01.119
Okay.

35:01.120 --> 35:02.999
This is crazy. I know.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.459
But the day we were
supposed to have...

35:04.460 --> 35:06.749
You know what?
Actually, I don't care.

35:06.750 --> 35:08.000
It's here now.

35:13.170 --> 35:14.789
You called me
last me last night.

35:14.790 --> 35:17.459
I heard a bunch of hollering.
It sounded like animals.

35:17.460 --> 35:18.830
It was my roommate.

35:21.120 --> 35:23.209
Necktie. It's a better look.

35:23.210 --> 35:25.710
I feel more myself now.

35:45.120 --> 35:47.250
Colonel Mustard available?

35:54.250 --> 35:56.419
Any word? Nothing yet.

35:56.420 --> 35:58.289
The FBI are searching
Bear Mountain Park.

35:58.290 --> 35:59.499
50 miles from Wallkill.

35:59.500 --> 36:01.879
Never would've
