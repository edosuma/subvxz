WEBVTT

00:05.964 --> 00:06.881
You like it?

00:06.965 --> 00:10.093
{\an3}Like it? I love it.
This is a great column.

00:10.176 --> 00:12.095
{\an3}Is Emma this funny
and bright in person?

00:12.178 --> 00:16.265
{\an1}Ah, typical writer, more funny
on the page than in person.

00:16.349 --> 00:18.435
Well, I think it's great.
I hope she does some more.

00:18.518 --> 00:20.770
I think her column
would add a lot to the paper.

00:20.854 --> 00:24.274
{\an1}See, aren't you glad I brought
the two of you together?

00:24.357 --> 00:26.401
Yeah. It's great.

00:31.698 --> 00:33.283
I know, I know.
It feels like a lot.

00:33.366 --> 00:35.076
Your mom moving to Arizona
for two months and all,

00:35.160 --> 00:37.579
but you'll handle it. Look.

00:37.662 --> 00:40.749
If things get a little crazy,
you still got me, right?

00:40.832 --> 00:43.251
That's sweet of you to say,
but you know I still haven't

00:43.334 --> 00:46.087
figured out
why you don't just find someone

00:46.171 --> 00:48.256
without all these
responsibilities in the way.

00:48.339 --> 00:49.591
You know,
someone you can just pick up

00:49.674 --> 00:51.217
and go to the beach with.

00:51.301 --> 00:53.136
Your responsibilities
are not in the way.

00:53.219 --> 00:54.971
I hardly notice them.

00:55.054 --> 00:56.306
Besides, I'm getting sick
of the beach.

00:56.389 --> 00:57.265
(springs creaking)

00:57.348 --> 00:58.475
Hold on a second.

00:58.558 --> 01:03.271
(Valerie squealing)

01:03.354 --> 01:07.442
{\an1}VALERIE:
Oh, yes, yes, yes!

01:07.525 --> 01:09.944
Oh, not this again.

01:10.028 --> 01:12.030
{\an3}Who do you think she
has in there with her?

01:12.113 --> 01:16.284
{\an1}VALERIE:
Oh, David!

01:18.745 --> 01:20.288
David.

01:20.371 --> 01:21.498
(squealing)

01:21.581 --> 01:23.333
Are you going
to help me out or not?

01:23.416 --> 01:26.628
Val, come on...

01:26.711 --> 01:28.505
{\an3}Last night.
This morning.

01:28.588 --> 01:29.798
They're never going to buy this.

01:29.881 --> 01:31.132
This is ridiculous.
Have you lost your mind?

01:31.216 --> 01:32.509
Oh, yes they will, okay?

01:32.592 --> 01:34.844
Just we... we need people
talking, all right?

01:34.928 --> 01:36.471
(sighs)

01:36.554 --> 01:38.139
Do you want Donna back or not?

01:45.396 --> 01:46.689
Okay.
Okay. Come on.

01:46.773 --> 01:48.066
(clearing throat)

01:48.149 --> 01:49.400
{\an1}Okay.

01:49.484 --> 01:51.653
{\an3}Okay.

01:51.736 --> 01:53.029
(moaning)
Oh, yeah.

01:53.112 --> 01:54.864
{\an1}Oh, yes!
Yes, yes!

01:54.948 --> 01:57.325
David. Who knew?

01:57.408 --> 01:58.868
Well, not Donna.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.204
{\an3}I didn't think
he had it in him.

02:01.287 --> 02:03.289
Somehow, I knew Valerie did.

02:06.376 --> 02:07.335
Would I like her?

02:07.418 --> 02:10.045
{\an3}Who?
Emma.

02:10.128 --> 02:12.340
{\an3}I feel like I know
her from her column.

02:12.423 --> 02:13.758
What does she look like?

02:13.842 --> 02:16.553
She looks like, um...

02:16.636 --> 02:19.055
a girl, you know?
Just looks like a normal girl.

02:19.138 --> 02:22.517
Oh, a normal girl.
That's a vivid picture.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.061
Men never pay attention
to anything.

02:25.144 --> 02:27.230
She's a good writer.
That's all I care about.

02:27.313 --> 02:29.566
She is a great writer.

02:29.649 --> 02:31.776
You know, Brandon,
I would really love to meet her.

04:30.853 --> 04:31.980
It wasn't like it sounded.

04:32.063 --> 04:33.523
No, of course not.

04:33.606 --> 04:35.024
If it was, you'd be dead.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.192
{\an1}(laughing)

04:36.275 --> 04:39.487
That's very funny stuff, Steve.

04:39.570 --> 04:41.489
You should perform at the
After Dark on comedy night.

04:41.572 --> 04:43.032
I'll put in a good word
with Val.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.534
{\an3}Mmm. I'm sure
you will.

04:44.617 --> 04:45.702
{\an1}Hey, you know,
David, I never got

04:45.785 --> 04:47.328
{\an3}a security
deposit from Val,

04:47.412 --> 04:49.247
{\an1}so no structural damage
to my house, okay?

04:49.330 --> 04:53.418
Okay, you know what? I-I can't
deal with this right now.

04:53.501 --> 04:54.877
I'm starting
my new career today.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.713
{\an3}Hmm?

04:56.796 --> 04:59.716
Okay, it's a car wash,
but it's a job, right?

04:59.799 --> 05:01.926
That it is.

05:02.010 --> 05:04.053
Waxing.
J-O-B.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.221
Waxing.
Wax on.

05:05.304 --> 05:07.223
So unsupportive in this house.

05:07.306 --> 05:08.391
(doorbell rings)

05:08.474 --> 05:11.269
I'll get it.

05:11.352 --> 05:12.562
Hey, Donna.

05:12.645 --> 05:14.063
Hey. I need your help.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.398
What?

05:15.481 --> 05:17.191
Okay. This afternoon I have

05:17.275 --> 05:19.068
{\an1}probably the most important
photo shoot of my career.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.236
Everything is set.

05:20.319 --> 05:22.030
{\an1}The photographer--
Annika Ward.

05:22.113 --> 05:24.741
{\an3}Ooh, you're working with
Annika Ward? That's awesome.

05:24.824 --> 05:28.036
Yeah, except my model called
this morning. She has mono.

05:28.119 --> 05:30.455
{\an3}Oh, I'm sorry. Is there
anything I can do?

05:30.538 --> 05:32.957
Well, there is one thing.

05:33.041 --> 05:35.084
{\an1}What?
Be my model.

05:35.168 --> 05:38.212
Donna, I haven't modeled
for years. There's no way I...

05:38.296 --> 05:39.297
Yes, you could.

05:39.380 --> 05:41.924
{\an1}You'd be great. Please, I've
worked with so many models

05:42.008 --> 05:44.093
and you put them all to shame.

05:44.177 --> 05:47.722
So, what you're saying is, you
can't find anybody else, right?

05:47.805 --> 05:48.723
And you're desperate?

05:48.806 --> 05:51.267
Totally desperate. Mm-hmm.

05:51.350 --> 05:53.102
Well, I do have to go
in to work today,

05:53.186 --> 05:55.063
but I could ask
for the afternoon off.

05:55.146 --> 05:57.231
Oh, that would be so great.

05:57.315 --> 05:58.566
Okay, I just need
your portfolio.

05:58.649 --> 05:59.776
I just have
to show it to Annika.

05:59.859 --> 06:01.611
All right, I will go upstairs

06:01.694 --> 06:02.904
and try to dig out my book.

06:02.987 --> 06:07.325
Thank you. Thank you.

06:09.535 --> 06:10.787
Hey.

06:13.164 --> 06:14.749
Ah. You're alive.

06:14.832 --> 06:16.334
I was wondering,

06:16.417 --> 06:18.294
since you didn't come back
to the apartment last night.

06:18.377 --> 06:22.298
Well, we don't owe each other
any explanations anymore.

06:22.381 --> 06:23.591
You made that very clear.

06:28.346 --> 06:31.307
I'm sorry.
I should have called.

06:31.390 --> 06:35.853
No, I was just worried when
you didn't come home last night.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.815
{\an1}Well, you don't have
to worry about him, Donna.

06:40.233 --> 06:45.029
Actually, uh, David
did come home last night.

06:54.372 --> 06:56.707
<i>Fine, it's all my fault.</i>

06:56.791 --> 06:59.877
Oh, look, rationalize it
any way you want.

06:59.961 --> 07:02.296
Look, I am not
going through this again.

07:02.380 --> 07:04.674
It is over.

07:09.595 --> 07:13.307
I have to get back to work.

07:13.391 --> 07:14.684
I'm sorry to interrupt,

07:14.767 --> 07:15.977
{\an3}but we're really getting
backed up out there.

07:16.060 --> 07:20.064
No, no, I'm sorry. I'm the one
who should apologize. I just...

07:20.148 --> 07:21.524
My wife...

07:21.607 --> 07:23.151
{\an1}Um...

07:23.234 --> 07:24.819
I'll be with you
in just a minute.

07:24.902 --> 07:27.029
Okay.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.364
Um...

07:28.447 --> 07:30.199
Dr. Monahan, I was
hoping that I could

07:30.283 --> 07:32.160
take this afternoon off.

07:32.243 --> 07:33.786
We haven't been
getting along for...

07:35.204 --> 07:36.372
for years.

07:37.999 --> 07:41.043
{\an1}At this point, the only option
really is separation.

07:41.127 --> 07:44.505
{\an1}Unfortunately, my wife
doesn't see it that way.

07:44.589 --> 07:46.048
I'm sorry to hear that.

07:46.132 --> 07:49.051
{\an1}I'm afraid our relationship
just isn't what it used to be.

07:49.135 --> 07:51.345
It's lost its magic.

07:51.429 --> 07:54.265
Used to be, we were, uh...

07:54.348 --> 07:57.101
this close.

07:59.604 --> 08:01.230
The patients?
Now all we've got

08:01.314 --> 08:03.858
is this distance-- this
horrible, horrible distance.

08:05.776 --> 08:08.571
Something I hope you never
have to experience, Kelly.

08:11.157 --> 08:16.204
Well...

08:16.287 --> 08:20.458
{\an1}Let's, um, let's get
to those patients, shall we?

08:20.541 --> 08:22.585
(phone ringing)

08:36.349 --> 08:38.100
Hey, how you doing?

08:38.183 --> 08:39.727
{\an1}I'm David Silver. I'm supposed
to be starting today.

08:39.809 --> 08:41.479
{\an3}Uh-huh.

08:41.562 --> 08:44.440
{\an3}And what exactly am I supposed
to do with that information?

08:44.524 --> 08:47.735
Well, I was just...

08:47.818 --> 08:48.778
I'd punch in if I were you.

08:49.737 --> 08:51.072
But that's just me.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.200
Time clock's inside.

08:55.701 --> 08:56.869
In here?

08:56.953 --> 08:59.455
Is this the locker room?

08:59.538 --> 09:00.998
If you want to call it that.

09:13.844 --> 09:15.096
Hey, that's mine.

09:17.598 --> 09:21.644
Oh, sorry. I, uh...
I'm looking for the time clock.

09:24.689 --> 09:27.066
(chuckling)

09:27.149 --> 09:29.402
Thanks.

09:30.695 --> 09:31.946
So, you work here, huh?

09:32.029 --> 09:33.155
Yeah, yeah, first day.

09:33.239 --> 09:35.199
{\an3}Bad move.

09:35.283 --> 09:38.244
{\an1}Yeah. I know,
but it's a job.

09:39.245 --> 09:40.871
{\an1}I'm David.

09:40.955 --> 09:43.124
Ben.

09:43.207 --> 09:45.668
{\an1}How you doing, man?
Nice to meet you.

09:45.751 --> 09:48.045
{\an5}MAN:
<i>I could never handle</i>
<i>waiting tables.</i>

09:48.129 --> 09:50.172
My last job lasted ten minutes.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.174
Everything was great
until I asked this lady

09:52.258 --> 09:54.760
if she wanted fruit or flies
with her burger.

09:56.137 --> 09:57.346
That's my set.

09:58.973 --> 10:02.101
Fruit or fries, fruit or flies?
You get it?

10:02.184 --> 10:03.519
I get it.

10:03.602 --> 10:04.812
(chuckles)

10:04.895 --> 10:06.147
Next.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.862
Okay, should I just start?

10:14.280 --> 10:17.199
Who's out here from L.A.?

10:17.283 --> 10:18.701
{\an1}I mean...

10:18.784 --> 10:19.910
who's from L.A. out here?

10:19.994 --> 10:21.162
{\an1}Nobody?

10:21.245 --> 10:23.331
Can I start again?

10:23.414 --> 10:25.916
Anybody here from L.A.?

10:26.000 --> 10:27.209
{\an3}Hey, Noah.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.669
{\an3}Valerie been
around yet today?

10:28.753 --> 10:30.046
She should be. Why?

10:30.129 --> 10:32.089
{\an3}Well, I just wanted to
make sure she's all right

10:32.173 --> 10:33.424
after last night.

10:33.507 --> 10:36.052
{\an1}Last night?
Why wouldn't she be?

10:36.135 --> 10:38.179
Well, I guess you didn't hear.

10:38.262 --> 10:43.100
Well, David and Valerie
kind of crashed...

10:43.184 --> 10:44.393
into each other.

10:44.477 --> 10:45.561
(laughs)

10:45.644 --> 10:48.105
{\an1}I'll pass along
your concern, okay?

10:48.189 --> 10:49.815
{\an3}Well, that might not
be for a few days.

10:49.899 --> 10:51.400
She's probably still
with the paramedics.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.402
{\an3}(laughing)

10:53.486 --> 10:55.071
Funny man.
Yeah.

10:55.154 --> 10:57.198
You can tell a lot
about a person from the kind

10:57.281 --> 10:59.075
of pet they have.

10:59.158 --> 11:00.409
Dogs are like....

11:00.493 --> 11:01.660
(panting)

11:01.744 --> 11:03.079
(in dopey voice):
"No problem by me."

11:03.162 --> 11:07.249
But cats, cats are....

11:07.333 --> 11:09.710
They're like...

11:09.794 --> 11:11.504
Cats are...

11:13.089 --> 11:15.049
They just, like, lie there.

11:18.511 --> 11:19.428
I'm serious.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.972
I'm funnier than that.

11:22.056 --> 11:25.101
Road kill is funnier than that.

11:25.184 --> 11:26.936
...mudslides and the fires.

11:27.019 --> 11:28.771
You could do better?

11:28.854 --> 11:30.231
Heck, yeah.

11:30.314 --> 11:31.941
{\an3}I was the funniest guy
in my fraternity.

11:32.024 --> 11:33.734
(chuckles)

11:33.818 --> 11:35.319
{\an1}I'm curious, how
does one decide that?

11:35.403 --> 11:37.863
Over a lot of beer.

11:37.947 --> 11:40.741
{\an3}How else?
Right.

11:40.825 --> 11:42.284
{\an1}Why don't you audition
for comedy night?

11:42.368 --> 11:44.912
I think I just might do that.

11:44.995 --> 11:47.248
Dust off some of my killer
one-liners and have at it.

11:47.331 --> 11:49.083
Just dust 'em off in a hurry.

11:49.166 --> 11:52.128
This is killing me.

11:52.211 --> 11:54.922
I'm serious.

11:59.552 --> 12:02.805
I think this article's going to
strike a cord with our readers.

12:02.888 --> 12:05.224
Just the readers?

12:07.143 --> 12:08.561
You know what I'd like?

12:08.644 --> 12:10.646
I'd like you to write
another article for us.

12:10.729 --> 12:12.982
In fact, I'd like you
to write a series

12:13.065 --> 12:14.525
of articles for us.

12:14.608 --> 12:16.110
A series of them, huh?

12:16.193 --> 12:18.112
Well, I don't know.

12:18.195 --> 12:19.321
I'm really busy.

12:21.907 --> 12:24.452
But I'm open to persuasion.

12:24.535 --> 12:26.787
Based on your phone call
last night,

12:26.871 --> 12:28.831
I'd say you're open
to a little more than that.

12:28.914 --> 12:30.040
I am.

12:30.124 --> 12:31.584
The question is:
Are you?

12:33.419 --> 12:35.838
About your articles...
The ones you're going

12:35.921 --> 12:37.173
to persuade me
to write over lunch?

12:37.256 --> 12:38.048
Lunch?

12:38.132 --> 12:41.177
Well, I have to drop off
a freelance piece

12:41.260 --> 12:43.554
{\an3}at <i> Buzz</i> magazine,
shouldn't take very long.

12:43.637 --> 12:46.807
Shall we say half hour,
The Natural Gourmet?

12:46.891 --> 12:49.059
Sounds good.

12:49.143 --> 12:52.688
I'm feeling persuaded already.

12:54.565 --> 12:56.025
Hi.

12:56.942 --> 12:58.360
{\an1}Hey, uh,

12:58.444 --> 13:00.696
Emma Bennett this
is Kelly Taylor.

13:00.779 --> 13:02.198
{\an3}Oh, hi.
Hi. Nice to meet you.

13:02.281 --> 13:03.199
Nice to meet you.

13:03.282 --> 13:05.201
{\an3}Brandon showed me your
column, I loved it.

13:05.284 --> 13:06.827
{\an5}Thanks.
I'm glad you're
writing for the paper.

13:06.911 --> 13:07.995
I hope you do more.

13:08.078 --> 13:10.664
Well, I'm in the
process of being

13:10.748 --> 13:12.208
convinced to do just that.

13:12.291 --> 13:13.292
Oh, you have to.

13:13.375 --> 13:14.543
Well, we'll see.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.338
{\an3}I'm late. It was
very nice to meet you.

13:17.421 --> 13:19.173
And I'll see you later.

13:19.256 --> 13:20.883
{\an1}Bye.
Talk to you later.

13:20.966 --> 13:24.011
She seems so nice.

13:24.094 --> 13:26.180
Yeah, yeah, she's okay.

13:26.263 --> 13:27.598
I, um, I have some time

13:27.681 --> 13:29.350
before I have to go do
that thing with Donna

13:29.433 --> 13:30.851
and I was thinking
it would be nice

13:30.935 --> 13:33.187
if we had lunch.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.607
I'd love to, Kel.

13:36.690 --> 13:38.234
I would, but, uh,

13:38.317 --> 13:40.069
today is a nightmare.

13:40.152 --> 13:42.530
{\an3}I'm gonna end up
eating here at my desk

13:42.613 --> 13:44.240
if I even get to eat at all.

13:44.323 --> 13:45.658
How about tomorrow?

13:45.741 --> 13:48.244
Okay, tomorrow.

13:49.495 --> 13:50.621
Bye.

14:02.299 --> 14:04.218
{\an5}DONNA:
<i>Thank you for coming</i>
<i>through for me on this one.</i>

14:04.301 --> 14:06.095
I should be thanking you.

14:06.178 --> 14:08.264
{\an3}I haven't felt that
glamorous lately.

14:08.347 --> 14:09.723
To be honest with you,

14:09.807 --> 14:11.100
{\an3}I haven't really
felt that desirable

14:11.183 --> 14:13.310
{\an3}so I think that this is
going to be a good thing.

14:13.394 --> 14:14.603
How are you?

14:14.687 --> 14:16.272
{\an3}How did things go
after this morning?

14:16.355 --> 14:19.108
{\an1}What, seeing Val
and David together?

14:19.191 --> 14:21.735
{\an1}Well, about a zillion things
went through my mind.

14:21.819 --> 14:24.446
And I thought I acted all
adult and mature and cool,

14:24.530 --> 14:27.241
{\an1}but deep down, I just wanted
to strangle them both.

14:27.324 --> 14:29.827
{\an3}What about Noah, have
you talked to him?

14:29.910 --> 14:31.328
{\an1}No, but my guess is
he feels the same way.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.455
Whatever, right?

14:33.539 --> 14:35.749
Anyway, um, this is
your dressing room,

14:35.833 --> 14:37.293
{\an1}and there's
a fridge and a phone

14:37.376 --> 14:39.128
{\an1}and someone from make-up
will come and get you

14:39.211 --> 14:40.796
{\an1}and I'm gonna run to
wardrobe, are you okay?

14:40.879 --> 14:42.131
Yeah.

14:42.214 --> 14:43.132
Thanks again, Donna.

14:43.215 --> 14:45.509
{\an1}Thank you.

15:01.400 --> 15:04.111
(phone ringing)
<i>The Beat.</i>

15:04.194 --> 15:06.322
Hi, Terri. It's Kelly.
Is Brandon there?

15:06.405 --> 15:08.324
No, he's not back
from lunch yet.

15:08.407 --> 15:10.200
He went to lunch?

15:10.284 --> 15:12.077
I thought he had
a lot of work to do.

15:12.161 --> 15:13.621
I'm sure.

15:13.704 --> 15:15.205
One of the perks of being boss
is that he just can

15:15.289 --> 15:16.957
dump it on me.

15:17.041 --> 15:19.209
Okay, bye.

15:27.217 --> 15:28.844
You'll have complete freedom,

15:28.927 --> 15:30.846
{\an3}not a single word of
yours will be touched.

15:30.929 --> 15:32.973
{\an1}But if I need a sounding board
you're available, right?

15:33.057 --> 15:34.308
Absolutely.

15:34.391 --> 15:35.726
Day or night?

15:35.809 --> 15:38.520
I tend to get a little
inspired after hours.

15:38.604 --> 15:41.815
{\an3}Why do I get the feeling that
every conversation we have

15:41.899 --> 15:43.859
{\an3}is about something
neither of us is saying?

15:43.942 --> 15:46.195
Try something <i> you</i> aren't saying.

15:46.278 --> 15:48.030
I say what's on my mind.

15:48.113 --> 15:49.114
My mind's on business.

15:49.198 --> 15:51.742
Is that right?

15:53.285 --> 15:55.162
85 percent.

15:58.624 --> 15:59.625
75 percent?

16:02.086 --> 16:05.005
Would you believe 50/50?

16:06.465 --> 16:08.050
You're cute.

16:08.133 --> 16:10.052
You know what?

16:10.135 --> 16:12.554
Something tells me you might
be able to convince me.

16:12.638 --> 16:15.224
Seriously?

16:15.307 --> 16:17.768
(chuckling)

16:17.851 --> 16:19.937
{\an1}Well,

16:20.020 --> 16:23.232
having said that, the
business half of this lunch

16:23.315 --> 16:25.401
is now officially over.

16:27.361 --> 16:30.072
I would like to get on
with the other 50 percent.

16:31.281 --> 16:33.158
Are you free the rest
of the afternoon?

16:48.215 --> 16:51.885
{\an5}JOE:
Hey, stop that, Dougie,
that's sexual harassment.

16:51.969 --> 16:53.345
You're right.

16:53.429 --> 16:54.763
I'm sorry, Ben.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.181
How about later I
make it up to you?

16:56.265 --> 16:59.226
Take you shopping
for a new dress.

17:00.185 --> 17:01.437
Why don't you shut your mouth.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.063
{\an1}Ooh!
Ooh!

17:03.147 --> 17:05.273
(Joe meowing)

17:05.357 --> 17:07.776
Boy, it didn't take you two
boys very long to bond, huh?

17:07.859 --> 17:10.612
{\an1}I guess you got
quite a bit in common.

17:10.695 --> 17:12.196
You queer, too, Davey?

17:17.953 --> 17:20.873
(scoffs)

17:24.167 --> 17:27.337
Burger and fries on eleven,
chili dog no onions on nine.

17:27.421 --> 17:29.923
Come on, it'll only
take ten minutes

17:30.007 --> 17:31.341
and it's right next door, Carly.

17:31.425 --> 17:32.968
Steve, no way,
we're swamped.

17:33.051 --> 17:34.470
But I want you to
see my audition.

17:34.553 --> 17:36.346
{\an5}Critique it, tell me
if I'm funny or not.
It's funny.

17:36.430 --> 17:37.931
{\an1}You haven't even
heard my act.

17:38.015 --> 17:39.641
{\an3}Well, if it's half as funny
as you asking me to leave

17:39.725 --> 17:40.809
Nat during the lunch rush,

17:40.893 --> 17:42.019
{\an3}you'll have them
rolling in the aisles.

17:42.102 --> 17:42.978
Well, at least you
can wish me luck.

17:43.061 --> 17:46.315
{\an3}You don't need luck,
not when you got talent.

17:47.900 --> 17:51.111
So, uh, my girlfriend, you know,
she says that I'm selfish right,

17:51.195 --> 17:54.323
and I say, "No, I'm not,
like, what do you mean?"

17:54.406 --> 17:56.033
I said, "Didn't I buy
ribbed condoms?"

17:56.116 --> 17:58.660
And she says, uh, "Yeah, but
you wore them inside out."

17:58.744 --> 17:59.828
(laughing)

17:59.912 --> 18:02.331
Okay, uh... I don't know.

18:02.414 --> 18:04.166
Can you believe this?
You think that was bad,

18:04.249 --> 18:05.501
you should've been
here this morning.

18:05.584 --> 18:07.002
{\an1}But I understand
you needed your rest.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.671
What's that supposed to mean?

18:09.755 --> 18:12.341
I heard you and David had
quite a night last night.

18:12.424 --> 18:15.344
{\an3}I can't believe what idle
gossips people can be.

18:15.427 --> 18:16.887
{\an1}Oh, like you didn't
sleep with him.

18:16.970 --> 18:19.681
As if that's any
of your business.

18:19.765 --> 18:23.352
{\an3}Let's just say I go for the
struggling car wash type.

18:23.435 --> 18:24.895
He was with Donna for so long,

18:24.978 --> 18:28.023
David needed to burn off a
little energy, that's all.

18:28.106 --> 18:30.150
All I know that is if my
girlfriend was a car...

18:30.234 --> 18:33.904
Well, all I know that
if, if, if, if, if.

18:33.987 --> 18:35.864
All I know is I spend about

18:35.948 --> 18:38.033
$16 thousand
worth of accessories

18:38.116 --> 18:39.368
and about eight dollars
worth of car.

18:39.451 --> 18:41.370
(laughing)

18:41.453 --> 18:44.623
{\an3}Thanks. Uh, we'll
let you know.

18:44.706 --> 18:47.376
Oh, all right.

18:47.459 --> 18:49.795
You're up, buddy.

18:49.878 --> 18:51.338
Well, here goes.

18:51.421 --> 18:53.423
{\an3}Good luck.

18:57.678 --> 18:59.012
How's everybody
doing tonight, good?

18:59.096 --> 19:01.014
Great...

19:01.098 --> 19:05.435
So, uh, I'm taking
these self-defense classes

19:05.519 --> 19:09.439
and after about 10 weeks,
50 bucks a pop,

19:09.523 --> 19:13.402
the instructor says to me,
"Oh, Steve, by the way,

19:13.485 --> 19:18.156
use this only
if you get attacked."

19:18.240 --> 19:19.366
Yeah, right.

19:19.449 --> 19:20.742
Like you go to medical school

19:20.826 --> 19:22.202
just in case there's
an emergency, huh?

19:22.286 --> 19:24.246
(chuckling)
Hell, no!

19:24.329 --> 19:26.957
I'm gonna use what I know,
I'm gonna kick some butt!

19:27.040 --> 19:28.584
(laughing)

19:28.667 --> 19:33.255
I said "No tomato on my burger."

19:33.338 --> 19:35.716
(exaggerated martial arts yell)

19:35.799 --> 19:38.260
(laughing)

19:38.343 --> 19:41.471
I don't think he'll be
making that mistake again.

19:41.555 --> 19:43.265
(laughing)

19:43.348 --> 19:44.933
It's like my grandma.

19:45.017 --> 19:49.062
She made me
these oatmeal cookies.

19:49.146 --> 19:51.106
I must've told Grandma
a hundred times.

19:51.189 --> 19:55.068
"Grandma, I don't like
oatmeal cookies."

19:55.152 --> 19:59.156
(exaggerated martial arts yell)

19:59.239 --> 20:00.616
I don't think
Granny's gonna be making

20:00.699 --> 20:03.577
that mistake again,
right, Granny?

20:08.832 --> 20:10.292
{\an1}Hey, they're almost
ready for you.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.419
{\an3}I just tried the paper again.
He's still not there.

20:12.502 --> 20:13.629
I'm sure he's fine.

20:13.712 --> 20:16.131
At work, he seemed distant.

20:16.214 --> 20:18.133
{\an3}Now he's not where
he said he would be.

20:18.216 --> 20:19.801
{\an3}It's not his well-being
I'm worried about.

20:19.885 --> 20:22.221
Kel, you're not thinking...

20:22.304 --> 20:24.181
I don't know.

20:24.264 --> 20:25.641
{\an3}It just seems like
he's hiding something.

20:25.724 --> 20:28.101
{\an1}Hiding something
or are you talking about

20:28.185 --> 20:29.436
hiding someone?

20:29.519 --> 20:30.646
Am I crazy?

20:30.729 --> 20:32.189
(sighing)

20:32.272 --> 20:34.274
You look absolutely stunning.

20:34.358 --> 20:35.776
{\an1}You two are
completely in love,

20:35.859 --> 20:37.194
it makes no sense.

20:37.277 --> 20:39.071
I hope you're right.

20:39.154 --> 20:40.197
{\an1}I'm sure wherever
Brandon is,

20:40.280 --> 20:41.782
{\an1}he has a perfectly
good explanation, okay?

20:41.865 --> 20:43.283
{\an1}Now, go have some
fun with this.

20:44.242 --> 20:46.286
Okay.

20:56.296 --> 20:57.297
I had a really great time.

20:57.381 --> 20:59.675
{\an3}So did I.

20:59.758 --> 21:01.510
Shopping on Melrose,

21:01.593 --> 21:04.137
{\an1}Botanical Gardens
in Pasadena,

21:04.221 --> 21:05.347
sunset on the beach.

21:05.430 --> 21:08.225
All of which were your idea.

21:08.308 --> 21:11.311
{\an1}Yeah, but I didn't exactly
have to twist your arm.

21:11.395 --> 21:13.313
No.

21:13.397 --> 21:16.900
So, would you say that our
business to pleasure ratio

21:16.984 --> 21:18.986
is still 50/50?

21:23.699 --> 21:26.535
Maybe 70/30.

21:26.618 --> 21:29.579
{\an1}Business?

21:31.456 --> 21:34.668
Or pleasure?

21:41.341 --> 21:44.302
Sometimes business
can be a pleasure.

21:44.386 --> 21:46.596
Do you wanna come in?

21:50.183 --> 21:55.313
I do, but I'm not going to.

21:57.315 --> 22:00.068
Not tonight, anyway.

22:24.468 --> 22:26.136
{\an3}KELLY:
What is this?

22:26.219 --> 22:28.305
Belgian waffles, your favorite.

22:28.388 --> 22:29.765
{\an3}(laughs)

22:29.848 --> 22:32.059
{\an3}Wow, what's
the occasion?

22:32.142 --> 22:33.101
No occasion,
I just felt like it.

22:33.185 --> 22:35.937
I tried to stay up
and wait up for you last night,

22:36.021 --> 22:38.231
but I was tired--
I went to bed around 1:00.

22:38.315 --> 22:39.441
What time did
you finally get home?

22:39.524 --> 22:42.402
{\an3}Uh, 2:30,
something like that.

22:42.486 --> 22:44.571
2:30? Well, you deserve
breakfast in bed.

22:44.654 --> 22:46.615
{\an1}I hope that means
it went well.

22:46.698 --> 22:48.116
Yeah. Yeah, it was great.

22:48.200 --> 22:51.286
Except for all the calls I made
trying to find you.

22:51.369 --> 22:53.163
{\an3}For someone so
swamped at work,

22:53.246 --> 22:55.248
you sure left the office early.

22:55.332 --> 22:58.919
Yeah, well, right after you
left, I got a lead on a story.

22:59.002 --> 23:00.796
I was chasing it down all day.

23:00.879 --> 23:02.255
(quietly):
Mm.

23:02.339 --> 23:03.965
Come on,
eat before it gets cold.

23:06.885 --> 23:08.804
What was the story about?

23:08.887 --> 23:10.639
What?

23:10.722 --> 23:12.849
What was the story about?

23:12.933 --> 23:16.520
Oh, it was about a...
civil court judge downtown

23:16.603 --> 23:18.855
who's allegedly
involved in some cult.

23:20.273 --> 23:21.316
Why?

23:21.399 --> 23:23.318
I just...

23:23.401 --> 23:26.029
I couldn't get
ahold of you, and...

23:27.697 --> 23:29.491
I don't want to doubt you
Brandon-- I'm sorry.

23:29.574 --> 23:30.867
{\an3}I just...

23:30.951 --> 23:33.203
had this weird feeling.

23:34.371 --> 23:36.373
It's okay.

23:38.208 --> 23:40.043
What do you say we get things
back on track, huh?

23:40.127 --> 23:43.171
{\an4}We'll go see Steve's
comedy thing tonight
at the After Dark,

23:43.255 --> 23:45.173
and then
after that we'll go out.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.466
What do you say?

23:46.550 --> 23:48.844
That sounds good.

23:52.139 --> 23:54.141
Hey, man, I want you to know,

23:54.224 --> 23:56.101
I really appreciate
what you did for me yesterday,

23:56.184 --> 23:58.186
{\an1}but there's no sense
in getting involved, man.

23:58.270 --> 24:00.480
{\an1}It's been going on a while,
and it's really not

24:00.564 --> 24:01.731
that big of a deal.

24:01.815 --> 24:03.525
Has anyone ever
said anything?

24:03.608 --> 24:04.943
Like... the owner?

24:05.026 --> 24:06.945
{\an1}What, Vince?
(chuckles)

24:07.028 --> 24:10.365
{\an4}Yeah, Vince is too busy
dropping acid and chasing
spaceships in the desert.

24:10.448 --> 24:12.701
No. You don't have

24:12.784 --> 24:14.911
{\an1}to worry about those guys,
really, they're not a problem.

24:14.995 --> 24:18.165
{\an6}I don't know, man,
you shouldn't have to
deal with that crap.

24:18.248 --> 24:19.082
I know, but...

24:19.166 --> 24:21.209
{\an1}those guys aren't
the problem.

24:21.293 --> 24:22.502
{\an1}(sighs):
It's my parents--

24:22.586 --> 24:24.462
{\an1}they're the ones
I can't live with.

24:24.546 --> 24:26.798
Or actually, they won't
let me live with them.

24:29.217 --> 24:31.553
Don't worry about it, man,
they'll come around.

24:31.636 --> 24:33.471
My dad kicked me out, man.

24:33.555 --> 24:35.891
{\an1}He said I've
destroyed his life.

24:35.974 --> 24:37.559
(scoffs):
<i>I've</i> destroyed <i> his</i> life,

24:37.642 --> 24:40.729
and I'm the one living in
the car wash for the past month.

24:40.812 --> 24:43.732
What about your mom?
Didn't she...

24:43.815 --> 24:45.358
She didn't do anything.

24:45.442 --> 24:47.360
She just stood there.

24:47.444 --> 24:49.571
{\an1}Look...

24:49.654 --> 24:52.908
I can deal with being gay.

24:52.991 --> 24:56.203
I just... can't deal
with my family not accepting me

24:56.286 --> 24:57.537
for who I am.

25:13.178 --> 25:14.596
What have we got here?

25:14.679 --> 25:16.223
Oh, those are just
some pictures from

25:16.306 --> 25:17.557
a shoot I did.
Do you mind?

25:17.641 --> 25:20.101
{\an5}Actually...
Come on, you wouldn't
have brought them to work

25:20.185 --> 25:21.436
{\an1}it you didn't want
someone to see.

25:21.519 --> 25:23.063
{\an3}Well, they were
in my purse.

25:23.146 --> 25:25.774
{\an4}Hold it, hold it,
just a few more.
I would like them back.

25:25.857 --> 25:27.609
{\an4}Well, now, that's
an expression
I've never seen

25:27.692 --> 25:30.111
{\an5}on your face before.
I said I would
like them back.

25:30.195 --> 25:32.614
Relax, Kelly-- I always knew
there was another side to you.

25:32.697 --> 25:34.574
{\an1}Too bad you're wasting
all that beauty

25:34.658 --> 25:36.952
{\an1}on a younger,
less experienced man.

25:37.035 --> 25:38.745
{\an1}Mr. Evans?

25:45.085 --> 25:48.838
(blues playing)

25:48.922 --> 25:50.465
{\an3}Well, looks like
my little idea

25:50.548 --> 25:53.134
{\an3}for theme nights is gonna
work out pretty well.

25:53.218 --> 25:54.636
<i>Your</i> idea?

25:54.719 --> 25:56.805
{\an3}All right, Noah, who
cares-- it's our idea.

25:56.888 --> 25:59.182
{\an3}This is great-- I mean,
look at the place.

25:59.266 --> 26:00.267
{\an3}We did it!

26:00.350 --> 26:02.310
{\an1}Yeah, Val, we're
a great team, huh?

26:02.394 --> 26:04.229
Hmm. Oh!

26:06.189 --> 26:08.149
Hey. Mm!

26:12.862 --> 26:15.949
{\an5}It didn't just go <i> well--</i>
Annika wants you to work
on her campaign full-time.

26:16.032 --> 26:17.325
She did not.

26:17.409 --> 26:18.451
She did.

26:18.535 --> 26:20.161
{\an3}Wow, that would be
a great opportunity.

26:20.245 --> 26:23.164
{\an6}But I'm really gonna
have to give it some
thought, you know?

26:23.248 --> 26:25.208
What'd you tell her?

26:25.292 --> 26:27.168
Donna?

26:28.128 --> 26:29.504
Oh.

26:31.256 --> 26:34.884
Sorry. I just wish I knew
what he was thinking, you know?

26:34.968 --> 26:37.137
Donna, the guy is
crazy about you.

26:37.220 --> 26:39.139
{\an3}I mean, he bought
a $300,000 boat

26:39.222 --> 26:40.640
{\an3}just to prove himself
to your mother.

26:40.724 --> 26:43.518
{\an1}They were selling it,
and he needed a place to live.

26:43.601 --> 26:47.564
I'm sorry, you should have
seen the look on her face.

26:47.647 --> 26:49.566
Go talk to him.

26:49.649 --> 26:51.234
Okay.

26:54.112 --> 26:57.032
Tonight's going great--
I'm so proud of you.

26:57.115 --> 26:58.450
It's not bad, huh?

26:58.533 --> 27:02.537
{\an6}What do you think
those two are trying to
prove over there, huh?

27:04.331 --> 27:05.874
I don't know.

27:05.957 --> 27:07.709
It bothers you, doesn't it?

27:07.792 --> 27:08.752
{\an1}Seeing her
with someone else?

27:08.835 --> 27:10.879
{\an3}Does it bother you
seeing him with someone else?

27:10.962 --> 27:13.923
It's not good to answer
that question with a question.

27:14.007 --> 27:15.550
(wry chuckle):
It seems to me like

27:15.633 --> 27:17.927
I'm not the only one
avoiding an answer here.

27:19.637 --> 27:21.514
Here you go, my lady.

27:21.598 --> 27:23.141
{\an1}Thanks.

27:24.392 --> 27:26.144
{\an3}What's up?

27:28.104 --> 27:30.732
Dr. Monahan's been making
these comments again.

27:30.815 --> 27:34.736
{\an3}Last you mentioned it, you
said you'd overreacted.

27:34.819 --> 27:38.073
I thought I had, but...
lately it's gotten worse.

27:38.156 --> 27:40.116
Sexual?

27:40.200 --> 27:42.077
Yeah.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.411
How much worse?

27:43.495 --> 27:45.038
Mm, it's nothing terrible.

27:45.121 --> 27:47.916
It's just I don't know
how to deal with it, you know?

27:47.999 --> 27:49.751
You got to call
him on it, Kel.

27:49.834 --> 27:50.877
You think I should report him?

27:50.960 --> 27:54.422
No, I think you should call him
on his behavior first,

27:54.506 --> 27:57.258
and then if it continues,
then, yeah, I think

27:57.342 --> 27:59.052
{\an3}you should file
a grievance.

27:59.135 --> 28:01.262
{\an6}(groans):
I can't believe
this guy.

28:01.346 --> 28:04.766
You know what, let's not
let it ruin our night, okay?

28:04.849 --> 28:06.267
It's not worth it.

28:06.351 --> 28:08.061
You'll talk to him?

28:08.144 --> 28:11.356
Yes. I promise,
first thing tomorrow.

28:11.439 --> 28:14.150
Okay.

28:14.234 --> 28:17.320
{\an4}Hey, I'm sorry,
I don't mean to break up
the party or anything,

28:17.404 --> 28:20.240
{\an5}but don't you think
we should go over
our introductions?
Yeah.

28:20.323 --> 28:23.118
{\an6}I'll be back in
one minute, okay?
Okay.

28:25.829 --> 28:27.455
{\an1}Donna, don't worry,
he'll be back.

28:27.539 --> 28:30.792
{\an1}I know it kills you when
he's gone for even a minute.

28:30.875 --> 28:34.796
{\an3}I never should've let you
back in the beach apartment.

28:34.879 --> 28:38.007
{\an5}(sighs)
I'm sorry, am I cramping
your style with Noah?

28:38.091 --> 28:40.969
{\an3}No. Actually, you have
no effect whatsoever

28:41.052 --> 28:42.429
{\an3}on my relationship
with Noah.

28:42.512 --> 28:44.139
{\an3}Trust me on
that one, David.

28:44.222 --> 28:46.474
{\an3}You know what, as long as
you're back in Valerie's bed,

28:46.558 --> 28:48.059
{\an3}maybe you should
go live <i> there.</i>

28:49.394 --> 28:52.021
{\an3}No problem.
Fine.

28:54.190 --> 28:56.192
{\an1}CARLY (laughs):
Ooh, hey...

28:56.276 --> 28:58.027
Watch out.
Hey, hey!

28:58.111 --> 28:59.821
There they are,
right on time!

28:59.904 --> 29:01.322
{\an3}What do you
say, Zach?

29:01.406 --> 29:03.158
{\an5}Hi, Nat.
Hi.
Thanks, Nat.

29:03.241 --> 29:05.160
{\an1}You're an
absolute lifesaver.

29:05.243 --> 29:07.036
{\an1}Okay, so, um,
I won't be long--

29:07.120 --> 29:08.705
{\an1}15 minutes,
half hour, tops?

29:08.788 --> 29:10.790
No problem-- we're
open till midnight,

29:10.874 --> 29:13.626
{\an6}and, you know,
they're not exactly
breaking the doors down.

29:13.710 --> 29:16.129
{\an4}(laughs):
Best behavior
for Nat, right?

29:16.212 --> 29:17.338
Right.
Okay.

29:17.422 --> 29:18.715
One for the mom.

29:18.798 --> 29:20.341
{\an1}Thank you.

29:22.260 --> 29:23.803
{\an6}(groans)
Hey, Steve,
Steve, my man,

29:23.887 --> 29:25.054
you got to relax,
you got to relax.

29:25.138 --> 29:27.891
{\an5}You're gonna be great.
No, I feel like I'm
gonna throw up.

29:27.974 --> 29:29.684
{\an6}Nah.
Listen, can I ask your
opinion on something?

29:29.767 --> 29:31.686
{\an1}Yeah, you bet, you bet--
I'm here for you, man.

29:31.769 --> 29:33.813
{\an1}I am here for you.
You are why I'm here.

29:33.897 --> 29:35.023
{\an3}Good, good, because,
quite frankly,

29:35.106 --> 29:36.483
{\an1}I've got
these jokes...

29:36.566 --> 29:37.525
I got to go.

29:37.609 --> 29:38.651
What? What?

29:38.735 --> 29:39.861
Oh, great.

29:39.944 --> 29:42.530
{\an5}Emma, what are
you doing here?
Surprised?

29:42.614 --> 29:45.366
{\an1}Steve asked me the other day
when I was at the paper.

29:45.450 --> 29:47.368
Mm.

29:51.289 --> 29:53.500
I'll be right back, okay?

29:54.918 --> 29:57.045
{\an1}"Emma, this is Kelly,
my <i> girlfriend."</i>

29:57.128 --> 29:59.839
{\an1}You must have overlooked
that one minor detail, huh?

29:59.923 --> 30:01.216
{\an1}Hey, Emma.
Hi.

30:01.299 --> 30:03.134
{\an1}They're about to start--
Steve's up first.

30:03.218 --> 30:06.221
{\an4}Emma, we have a great
table over there,
if you wanna join us.

30:06.304 --> 30:07.931
{\an1}I'd love to.
Great.

30:25.198 --> 30:27.408
{\an1}Could I have
your attention, please?

30:27.492 --> 30:30.078
Welcome to the After Dark's
Comedy Night.

30:30.161 --> 30:31.371
{\an3}Thank you all
for coming tonight.

30:31.454 --> 30:32.872
{\an3}Are you guys
in the mood to laugh?

30:32.956 --> 30:34.415
CROWD:
Yeah!

30:34.499 --> 30:36.417
{\an5}VALERIE:
So, uh, let's get
the show on the road.

30:36.501 --> 30:39.128
{\an3}Please have a huge warm
welcome for Steve Sanders!

30:39.212 --> 30:42.257
(cheering, shouts)

30:42.340 --> 30:44.259
Break a leg.

30:46.177 --> 30:47.929
(whistling)

30:48.012 --> 30:50.431
All right! All righty!

30:50.515 --> 30:52.600
How you doing?
How's everybody tonight, good?

30:52.684 --> 30:54.269
CROWD:
Yeah!

30:54.352 --> 30:55.812
That's great.

30:55.895 --> 30:58.231
You know, I'm taking
these self-defense classes.

30:58.314 --> 31:01.776
And after about ten weeks
at 50 bucks a pop,

31:01.859 --> 31:04.279
the instructor says to me,
"Steve, by the way,

31:04.362 --> 31:08.116
you only use this
in case you're attacked."

31:08.199 --> 31:10.159
Yeah, right, you only go

31:10.243 --> 31:12.579
to medical school just in case
there's an emergency, huh?

31:12.662 --> 31:14.497
Uh-uh, not me.
I'm gonna go out there

31:14.581 --> 31:16.416
and I am gonna kick some butt.

31:16.499 --> 31:18.167
It's, like,

31:18.251 --> 31:21.588
{\an5}(surly voice):
I said no tomato
on my hamburger.

31:21.671 --> 31:24.173
(exaggerated martial arts yell)

31:24.257 --> 31:27.343
(people coughing,
electronic feedback)

31:28.845 --> 31:30.430
(nervous chuckle)

31:30.513 --> 31:31.889
(man coughing)

31:33.224 --> 31:36.185
My grandma...

31:36.269 --> 31:39.147
she made these oatmeal cookies
for me, and I...

31:39.230 --> 31:44.485
and I told her, "Grandma,
I don't like oatmeal cookies."

31:44.569 --> 31:47.280
(people coughing)

31:51.409 --> 31:54.037
(Steve chuckling nervously)

31:56.748 --> 31:58.291
Um...

31:58.374 --> 32:02.128
did you ever notice that
when little kids get embarrassed

32:02.211 --> 32:04.297
they always lift up whatever
they have over there head?

32:04.380 --> 32:07.300
Like, little boys
will pick up their jackets,

32:07.383 --> 32:10.219
and little girls will lift their
dresses way up over their head.

32:10.303 --> 32:11.888
(laughter)

32:11.971 --> 32:14.932
I don't think we ever should've
stopped this behavior as adults.

32:15.016 --> 32:16.309
(laughter)

32:16.392 --> 32:17.518
Say you're a chick looking

32:17.602 --> 32:19.354
for a job,
you go into the interview,

32:19.437 --> 32:21.189
just lift the dress
up over your head

32:21.272 --> 32:24.359
and say, "I want this job,
I need this job."

32:24.442 --> 32:26.194
{\an1}(laughter)
Yeah!

32:26.277 --> 32:27.528
It's just a theory.

32:27.612 --> 32:29.238
May not be true.

32:29.322 --> 32:32.033
But don't blame me if it works.

32:32.116 --> 32:34.744
I was in New York City recently.

32:34.827 --> 32:37.205
Man, the cops
sure are different there.

32:37.288 --> 32:40.208
I mean, they don't care
how fast you drive in New York.

32:40.291 --> 32:42.210
You could be doing
50 miles an hour

32:42.293 --> 32:44.712
down 5th Avenue
with a beer between your legs,

32:44.796 --> 32:46.589
the seat belt
hanging out the window,

32:46.673 --> 32:49.217
running all these red lights.

32:49.300 --> 32:50.885
The cops sees that,
he's gonna say,

32:50.968 --> 32:53.763
"Bring me a doughnut
on your way back, would ya?"

32:53.846 --> 32:55.390
(laughter)

32:55.473 --> 32:57.850
It's much different
here in California.

32:57.934 --> 33:01.020
I got stopped the other day
in Beverly Hills,

33:01.104 --> 33:05.566
and I said, "Wh-What's
the problem, Officer?"

33:05.650 --> 33:07.902
"Your right speaker's out."

33:07.985 --> 33:09.654
(all laugh)

33:10.154 --> 33:11.781
(all cheering)

33:13.157 --> 33:14.784
Whoo!

33:22.083 --> 33:24.127
(knocking)

33:26.879 --> 33:28.715
Yes, can I help you?

33:28.798 --> 33:30.299
Uh, Mrs. Wester?

33:30.383 --> 33:31.426
Yes.

33:31.509 --> 33:32.719
You don't know me.

33:32.802 --> 33:35.138
My name is David.
I work with your son, Ben,

33:35.221 --> 33:36.180
at the car wash.

33:36.264 --> 33:37.098
{\an1}MAN:
Who is it honey?

33:37.181 --> 33:38.725
Is something wrong?

33:38.808 --> 33:41.102
Is Ben all right?

33:41.185 --> 33:42.603
Well, um...

33:42.687 --> 33:44.105
Who is this?

33:44.188 --> 33:45.940
{\an3}He works with Ben
at a car wash.

33:46.023 --> 33:46.941
{\an1}Something's happened
to Ben.

33:47.024 --> 33:48.234
No, it's nothing like that.

33:48.317 --> 33:49.944
He hasn't been in an accident
or anything.

33:50.027 --> 33:52.447
What specifically
are you here for?

33:52.530 --> 33:55.324
(sighs)
Well, um...

33:56.743 --> 33:59.662
I came tell you
that Ben needs....

33:59.746 --> 34:00.663
{\an1}MAN:
Benjamin needs

34:00.747 --> 34:02.248
{\an1}a great many things,
I'm afraid.

34:02.331 --> 34:07.253
Most of which you might be
better suited to help him with.

34:07.336 --> 34:10.590
Hey, wait a sec.
Wait. Don't close the door.

34:10.672 --> 34:13.176
{\an3}Look, I only, I only met Ben
yesterday, all right?

34:13.259 --> 34:14.177
I work with him,

34:14.260 --> 34:15.052
but that was long enough

34:15.136 --> 34:17.304
to realize that
he's in real trouble.

34:17.388 --> 34:19.264
I mean, he has
nowhere to go

34:19.348 --> 34:20.850
and no one to turn to.

34:20.933 --> 34:23.643
Your son is in pain.
He's in real pain.

34:27.273 --> 34:29.734
I don't have a son.

34:37.116 --> 34:38.784
(sighs)

34:41.536 --> 34:43.289
BRANDON:
<i>Listen to this review.</i>

34:43.371 --> 34:45.208
{\an1}"Sanders has a presence
and an innate talent

34:45.291 --> 34:47.668
"for the one-liner
that you rarely see

34:47.752 --> 34:49.712
{\an1}in the comedic talents
of today." Rave.

34:49.795 --> 34:51.130
Brandon, we can't
print that.

34:51.214 --> 34:52.840
Why not?

34:52.924 --> 34:54.967
Because it's embarrassing.
It's too much, Brandon.

34:55.051 --> 34:56.344
Besides this is our paper.

34:56.427 --> 34:57.804
We can't be objective with that.

34:57.887 --> 34:59.514
The guy's an independent
reviewer, Steve!

34:59.597 --> 35:00.973
He doesn't work for us.

35:01.057 --> 35:03.267
It's not right.

35:03.351 --> 35:05.019
Trust me. I'm the editor.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.312
{\an1}STEVE:
And I'm the publisher.

35:06.395 --> 35:07.772
We're not printing that.

35:07.855 --> 35:10.191
Is there something going on here
you're not telling me?

35:10.274 --> 35:11.901
No, nothing.

35:21.786 --> 35:23.704
So it's true what they say
about really good comics.

35:23.788 --> 35:26.249
What do they say
about really good comics?

35:26.332 --> 35:28.334
They're extremely self-loathing.

35:30.294 --> 35:31.712
Hey, guys.

35:31.796 --> 35:33.339
{\an1}Emma,

35:33.422 --> 35:35.883
we're just, uh, dealing
with a little situation here.

35:35.967 --> 35:37.885
{\an3}20 minutes to press and
20 inches of blank space?

35:37.969 --> 35:39.262
That's a little situation?

35:39.345 --> 35:41.097
{\an3}Brandon, what are
we gonna run?

35:41.180 --> 35:42.974
How about that?

35:45.434 --> 35:47.228
What's this?

35:47.311 --> 35:48.855
My column.

35:53.860 --> 35:56.070
Terri, would you give us
a minute?

35:56.153 --> 35:58.322
{\an3}Sure.

36:01.659 --> 36:03.452
{\an1}After our conversation
last night,

36:03.536 --> 36:06.080
{\an1}I figured your days as
a columnist here were over.

36:06.163 --> 36:08.958
{\an6}Well, I can separate
business from
pleasure. Can you?

36:09.041 --> 36:10.793
What's it about?

36:10.877 --> 36:12.587
{\an3}Something I've been
lucky enough

36:12.670 --> 36:14.130
{\an3}to have very little
experience with

36:14.213 --> 36:18.342
{\an3}till just recently:
two-timing men.

36:24.348 --> 36:25.266
Hi.

36:25.349 --> 36:26.475
Hi.

36:26.559 --> 36:28.436
How are we today, Kelly?

36:28.519 --> 36:31.105
Fine.

36:31.188 --> 36:35.443
No, actually I'm not.

36:35.526 --> 36:37.445
{\an1}Oh, I'm sorry.
Anything I can do?

36:37.528 --> 36:39.238
As a matter of
fact, there is.

36:39.322 --> 36:43.117
While I find your work here
admirable,

36:43.201 --> 36:45.119
I have very little respect
for you as a person.

36:45.202 --> 36:48.080
{\an3}I will not stand
for anymore references,

36:48.164 --> 36:50.666
however subtle, to my sexuality.

36:50.750 --> 36:53.294
{\an3}I know that you're
having problems at home,

36:53.377 --> 36:55.129
but I don't think
that I'm the person

36:55.212 --> 36:56.797
you should be sharing
these things with.

36:56.881 --> 36:58.341
I find it very inappropriate,

36:58.424 --> 37:01.010
and it makes me
very uncomfortable.

37:04.889 --> 37:07.475
Are you accusing me
of sexual harassment?

37:07.558 --> 37:10.519
I'm just telling you...

37:10.603 --> 37:13.439
"Inappropriate"? What a joke.

37:13.522 --> 37:15.483
{\an1}Do you have a problem
working with men,

37:15.566 --> 37:17.985
Miss Taylor?

37:18.069 --> 37:19.153
Since you are so easily offended

37:19.236 --> 37:21.864
by what is obviously
adult conversation,

37:21.948 --> 37:24.533
I suggest you go get a job
at a nursery school

37:24.617 --> 37:27.370
instead of a street clinic.

37:39.215 --> 37:41.133
(Steve chuckling)

37:41.217 --> 37:43.177
Richard, uh, Belzer?

37:43.260 --> 37:44.053
Yeah.

37:44.136 --> 37:46.222
{\an3}The guy from that
show <i> Homicide?</i>

37:46.305 --> 37:49.016
Yeah, he's a comedian, too.

37:49.100 --> 37:52.186
{\an3}And I'm sure
a very funny one.

37:52.269 --> 37:54.647
{\an3}But right now, we have
the house all to ourselves,

37:54.730 --> 37:56.482
{\an3}and your success
to celebrate.

37:56.565 --> 37:58.693
{\an1}Which is why
I think you should listen

37:58.776 --> 38:00.861
to this comedy CD again.

38:00.945 --> 38:02.071
Again? I've never
heard it before.

38:02.154 --> 38:05.449
Yeah, you did.

38:06.409 --> 38:08.536
{\an3}No.

38:08.619 --> 38:09.578
No, I haven't.

38:09.662 --> 38:10.746
Uh, yeah, you have.

38:10.830 --> 38:15.251
I, uh, I did his act
on stage at the club.

38:15.334 --> 38:17.086
You did his act?

38:17.169 --> 38:20.423
Well, no, not at first.

38:20.506 --> 38:23.551
Just, you know, the parts where
people actually were laughing.

38:23.634 --> 38:26.262
You stole his jokes?

38:26.345 --> 38:28.222
Stole?

38:28.306 --> 38:29.557
No, I didn't steal.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.058
I-I borrowed.

38:31.142 --> 38:33.561
He can have his jokes back
whenever he wants them.

38:35.146 --> 38:36.105
Look, imagine
what it was like for me.

38:36.188 --> 38:38.232
I'm up on the stage
in the spotlight in front

38:38.315 --> 38:39.400
of all these people,

38:39.483 --> 38:43.070
and suddenly I realize that
I can't be funny on command.

38:43.154 --> 38:44.697
The only thing in my head
is Belzer's act,

38:44.780 --> 38:46.073
so I figure, "What the heck?"

38:46.157 --> 38:48.242
I can't believe you did this.

38:48.326 --> 38:50.119
Believe it.

38:50.202 --> 38:51.746
You know, when

38:51.829 --> 38:53.080
I-I was in college once,

38:53.164 --> 38:55.082
I ripped off
one of Brandon's term papers.

38:55.166 --> 38:56.459
{\an3}Now that

38:56.542 --> 38:59.128
was the mother
of all screw-ups.

38:59.211 --> 39:00.379
This is just a little one.

39:00.463 --> 39:04.258
So you're kind of slow to learn,
I'd say.

39:04.341 --> 39:06.594
The evidence speaks for itself.

39:06.677 --> 39:10.765
I'm not just slow,

39:10.848 --> 39:12.016
{\an3}sometimes I'm
downright dumb.

39:12.099 --> 39:16.312
I'm so stupid I actually once
had a crush on Ellen DeGeneres.

39:16.395 --> 39:18.105
{\an3}I thought
escort services

39:18.189 --> 39:20.566
were for guys who needed dates.

39:20.649 --> 39:23.819
(chuckles)
Nobody's that dumb.

39:23.903 --> 39:26.113
Oh, yeah, does this look like
the face of a member of Mensa?

39:26.197 --> 39:27.114
I don't think.

39:27.198 --> 39:28.240
(chuckles)

39:28.324 --> 39:29.658
You tell me the check's
in the mail,

39:29.742 --> 39:30.993
and I'm checking the mailbox
every day.

39:31.077 --> 39:34.121
(laughs)
Steve, look at me!

39:34.205 --> 39:35.247
What?

39:35.331 --> 39:37.291
Am I laughing?

39:37.375 --> 39:38.459
{\an1}Have you made me
laugh?

39:38.542 --> 39:40.252
Is this a trick question?

39:40.336 --> 39:42.213
No.

39:42.296 --> 39:45.132
Look, you don't need Belzer.

39:45.216 --> 39:47.134
You really are funny
all by yourself.

39:47.218 --> 39:51.222
You know, I'm just dumb enough
to believe that.

39:59.688 --> 40:01.232
{\an1}If we did this well
mid-week with comedy,

40:01.315 --> 40:03.025
{\an1}can you imagine what the
weekends are gonna do?

40:03.109 --> 40:05.152
{\an3}Easy boy. Any giddier
and people are gonna start

40:05.236 --> 40:06.487
{\an3}thinking that you're
a trust-fund baby

40:06.570 --> 40:08.197
{\an3}who's never made
a hard-earned dollar.

40:08.280 --> 40:09.824
And you're not happy
that we're doing well?

40:09.907 --> 40:12.034
I'm gonna take my ten percent
to the piggy bank.

40:12.118 --> 40:14.203
So what are you gonna do
with your share?

40:14.286 --> 40:15.830
{\an3}Romantic vacation
with Donna

40:15.913 --> 40:17.206
or are you gonna spend
some quiet time

40:17.289 --> 40:18.207
at the beach apartment
now that

40:18.290 --> 40:19.208
David's not there?

40:20.584 --> 40:21.502
David moved out?

40:21.585 --> 40:23.462
She kicked him out again.

40:23.546 --> 40:25.172
Where's he gonna live?

40:25.256 --> 40:27.133
My place.

40:27.216 --> 40:29.135
There can't be many rooms
left over there.

40:29.218 --> 40:30.928
Oh, I'll squeeze him in.

40:32.388 --> 40:34.181
Speak of the devil.

40:34.265 --> 40:35.349
{\an3}Hey, Donna.

40:35.432 --> 40:38.519
Hey. Sorry. Am I interrupting?

40:38.602 --> 40:40.604
{\an3}Oh, don't be silly.
I'm late.

40:40.688 --> 40:42.148
I promised David
I would help him

40:42.231 --> 40:44.024
{\an1}with him being
in transition and all.

40:44.108 --> 40:46.861
{\an1}You guys want to be alone,
I'm sure. Bye.

40:48.154 --> 40:49.905
What is her deal?

40:49.989 --> 40:53.033
{\an3}I don't know, but whatever
it is, it's her deal.

40:53.117 --> 40:55.035
{\an3}So, I heard you asked
David to move out.

40:55.119 --> 40:56.787
Val tell you that?

40:56.871 --> 40:59.165
{\an3}She might've
mentioned it, yeah.

40:59.248 --> 41:00.082
Why'd you do that?

41:00.166 --> 41:01.333
Why'd I do that?

41:01.417 --> 41:02.835
{\an1}I thought you'd be happy
with the fact

41:02.918 --> 41:04.086
that I'm no longer
living with my ex.

41:04.170 --> 41:06.422
{\an3}It's not that,
it's just, you know...

41:06.505 --> 41:07.882
{\an1}What? More unhappy
about the fact

41:07.965 --> 41:09.508
{\an1}that he's gonna be living
with <i> your</i> ex?

41:09.592 --> 41:11.719
{\an3}We went out a few times.
She's not my ex okay?

41:11.802 --> 41:15.014
{\an3}You still have
feelings for David.

41:15.097 --> 41:18.100
{\an3}You guys went out for seven
years. That's history.

41:18.184 --> 41:20.561
Yeah, I do still care for David,

41:20.644 --> 41:22.521
I probably always will.

41:22.605 --> 41:24.231
{\an1}But those feelings
don't stop me from moving

41:24.315 --> 41:25.524
into another relationship.

41:25.608 --> 41:27.401
{\an1}Hey,

41:27.484 --> 41:29.236
do you feel the same way?

41:30.154 --> 41:31.530
{\an1}I mean, I guess
that's what

41:31.614 --> 41:34.700
I was asking last night,
'cause I need to know.

41:38.037 --> 41:40.164
Let me see if I can answer
that question.

41:48.881 --> 41:51.091
{\an5}KELLY:
<i>I decided not to take</i>
<i>the modeling job.</i>

41:51.175 --> 41:54.470
{\an3}This whole ordeal with Monahan
has really made me realize

41:54.553 --> 41:57.139
that I don't ever want
to trade on my looks.

41:57.223 --> 41:59.767
{\an1}I'm proud of the way
you stood up to him, Kel.

41:59.850 --> 42:02.353
Me, too. I don't think
it's gonna do any good,

42:02.436 --> 42:04.355
but I'm glad I did it.

42:08.525 --> 42:09.777
What's that?

42:09.860 --> 42:11.987
{\an3}It's a copy
of Emma's column.

42:12.071 --> 42:14.323
How did you get it?

42:14.406 --> 42:15.491
Steve brought it home.

42:15.574 --> 42:17.785
{\an3}This one is even better
than the last.

42:17.868 --> 42:20.079
You want to know what
I found interesting?

42:20.162 --> 42:21.121
What?

42:21.205 --> 42:22.289
Even after the girl

42:22.373 --> 42:23.666
{\an3}that Emma's writing
about found out

42:23.749 --> 42:26.001
{\an3}that the guy she fell for
had a girlfriend,

42:26.085 --> 42:27.211
{\an3}she still wanted
to pursue him.

42:27.294 --> 42:31.966
That makes her kind of a home
wrecker, don't you think?

42:32.049 --> 42:33.092
I don't know.

42:33.175 --> 42:35.511
{\an6}Maybe she and
this guy really
have something.

42:35.594 --> 42:38.180
{\an3}Something that he and his
girlfriend don't have,

42:38.264 --> 42:39.640
and maybe they shouldn't be
together.

42:39.723 --> 42:42.601
How do you suppose the guy
and his girlfriend know

42:42.685 --> 42:44.645
if they actually
have something or not?

42:44.728 --> 42:46.313
How do <i> you</i> know?

42:46.397 --> 42:49.942
I don't know. I just know.

42:50.025 --> 42:52.236
Well, there's your answer.

42:57.658 --> 42:59.868
(phone rings)

43:02.371 --> 43:03.289
Hello?

43:03.372 --> 43:05.541
I miss you.

43:08.585 --> 43:09.837
Hello?

43:09.920 --> 43:12.423
Kelly's there, isn't she?

43:12.506 --> 43:13.841
Lying right next to you?

43:13.924 --> 43:15.968
Hello?

43:16.051 --> 43:17.720
Right where I want to be.

43:21.223 --> 43:22.224
(phone beeps)

43:23.434 --> 43:24.435
{\an3}Crank?

43:24.518 --> 43:26.520
Must've been.
