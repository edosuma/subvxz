WEBVTT

00:08.008 --> 00:10.010
Congratulations. You're pregnant.

00:10.552 --> 00:11.428
Holy shit.

00:11.511 --> 00:12.887
<i>Previously on You Me Her...</i>

00:12.971 --> 00:14.431
I'm keeping it.

00:14.514 --> 00:17.017
Jack, Izzy, I'm in love
with the two of you.

00:17.100 --> 00:20.270
I could never trust her, and I would be
beyond disappointed if you could.

00:20.353 --> 00:22.689
For the record, I'm also
Mr. Right There in Front of You.

00:22.772 --> 00:24.524
I'm gonna be putting more time
into the magazine, and we need to come up with a plan.

00:26.443 --> 00:28.903
You wanted to stay at home.
This was a mutual decision.

00:28.987 --> 00:32.032
I spoke to your grandmother's counsellor.
She asked if you'd want to go for coffee.

00:32.115 --> 00:34.075
Fine, but you seriously
have to be there.

00:34.159 --> 00:35.785
I will. I promise.

00:35.869 --> 00:38.872
I don't know. Maybe Andy was right,
what he said to me when we broke up.

00:38.955 --> 00:41.666
"It's not me. It's you."

00:41.750 --> 00:42.959
-Fuck.
-Yeah.

00:43.042 --> 00:44.669
Favourite part of the job.
There you go.

00:44.753 --> 00:46.421
Oh. We have to celebrate.

00:49.340 --> 00:50.717
What's that look?

00:50.800 --> 00:53.261
-Hey! There they are.
-Hi.

00:53.344 --> 00:55.180
My God. What is Emma doing--

00:55.263 --> 00:57.932
-You were in on this.
-Yeah.

00:58.016 --> 00:59.434
-Iz.

00:59.517 --> 01:00.977
I'm pregnant and I'm keeping it.

01:01.061 --> 01:01.895
S...

01:02.228 --> 01:03.605
Six weeks, so...

01:03.688 --> 01:05.398
He knows, doesn't he?

01:05.482 --> 01:06.691
Jack!

01:16.701 --> 01:19.954
That day in the loft,
what'd you call it?

01:20.038 --> 01:21.623
Oh, yeah, it was a "mistake."

01:21.706 --> 01:24.417
No, it turns out that was
the only completely real thing

01:24.501 --> 01:25.835
I've done in the last six months.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.837
And yet, you left again.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.340
Yeah, I ran away
'cause I was fucking terrified.

01:30.423 --> 01:31.716
Of what?

01:32.175 --> 01:34.969
Of the day you and Jack
realized I was unnecessary.

01:35.929 --> 01:39.057
Jack loves you, Izzy.
He is deeply in love with you.

01:39.140 --> 01:41.017
-And you think that that would--
-Stop.

01:41.100 --> 01:42.852
...that would piss me off
or make me jealous,

01:42.936 --> 01:45.522
but it doesn't,
because this just feels right.

01:45.939 --> 01:49.275
And I don't wanna fuck it up.
I cannot fuck this up again.

01:50.401 --> 01:52.320
This happened
when we were together.

01:53.488 --> 01:55.615
We made this baby together.

01:58.701 --> 02:00.745
I love you so fucking much.

02:11.506 --> 02:12.632
All of it.

02:15.844 --> 02:18.138
I love you so fucking much.

02:32.569 --> 02:33.778
Yipes.

02:35.363 --> 02:37.824
This is so much better than
I expected after that scream.

02:39.659 --> 02:42.871
Is this what it was like the last time
you two made out in the bathroom?

02:42.954 --> 02:45.290
It was a little more like this.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.503
-And then I went like this.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.505
And like this.

02:53.047 --> 02:56.384
Remember?
Yeah. Come here.

Yeah. I'm pretty sure I just got stood up
by a catsitter/Instagram consultant.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.753
Oh! Wow, okay.

03:31.836 --> 03:36.841
Well, that knocks off the bicycle
detailer/fraternity party planner

03:36.925 --> 03:38.968
-Yeah.

03:39.052 --> 03:42.805
Yeah. A bunch of the guys
I was messaging went radio silent.

03:42.889 --> 03:46.059
I haven't hooked anything
for almost 24 hours.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.228
Uh-oh.

03:49.687 --> 03:50.772
Uh

03:50.855 --> 03:54.859
Well, it seems like the boys
of Portland are talkin'.

03:56.861 --> 03:59.572
Seriously? Like I'm on
some kind of Tinder shit list?

03:59.656 --> 04:01.991
-I don't know.
-Ugh!

04:02.659 --> 04:04.911
Fuck! How am I supposed to finish
my fucking thesis

04:04.994 --> 04:06.162
if everybody's scared of me?!

04:06.246 --> 04:08.873
I know, right? Hmm.

04:10.458 --> 04:13.336
So I was gonna sneak out and catch
<i>Pillow Talk</i> at the Paramount.

04:13.419 --> 04:17.340
And you're welcome to tag along
if you want, or whatever.

04:17.423 --> 04:20.677
I mean, it's a light crowd
and, uh, he can handle it, so...

04:21.636 --> 04:24.305
Are you seriously asking me on a date
right now?

04:24.389 --> 04:25.598
Absolutely not.

04:25.682 --> 04:28.184
I'm just proposing that we grab a bite,
and then we go see

04:28.268 --> 04:32.021
one of the 10 essential romcoms
of the 20th century.

04:32.105 --> 04:35.984
Okay, so... so now it's the proverbial
dinner <i>and</i> a movie?

04:36.067 --> 04:37.527
-Oh, right.

04:37.610 --> 04:41.030
You know, you're just... you're turning
this into something that it clearly isn't.

04:41.114 --> 04:44.492
And quite frankly, I don't, you know,
I don't feel comfortable.

04:44.575 --> 04:46.286
-Oh.
-So...

04:47.161 --> 04:49.497
But you don't think
I see how you look at me?

04:50.123 --> 04:53.668
You know, I can feel
your searing eyes on my ass,

04:53.751 --> 04:55.336
making my ass even hotter.

04:55.420 --> 04:56.754
It's true.

04:58.423 --> 05:00.008
Say yes.

05:01.217 --> 05:03.094
-Yes.
Yes. Yes. Yes!

05:05.138 --> 05:07.640
Oh. See?

05:09.350 --> 05:11.311
Yeah. You know where to find me.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.479
Okay.

05:17.817 --> 05:20.695
Do you really think they're getting it on
in our master bathroom right now?

05:20.778 --> 05:22.989
Fighting, fucking?
Fighting while fucking?

05:23.072 --> 05:24.907
It's all on the table right now. Or the vanity, in this case.

05:26.909 --> 05:30.455
Okay, I'm gonna think about that every
time I brush my teeth now. Thank you.

05:30.538 --> 05:32.749
I'm so glad we didn't do this
at my house.

05:33.958 --> 05:35.918
If you examine what we're
doing right now, just standing there,

05:36.002 --> 05:37.670
-looking up at the stairs...

05:37.754 --> 05:39.839
I don't think you'd like
what it says about us.

05:42.967 --> 05:45.970
Um, congratulations...
on the magazine.

05:46.054 --> 05:47.972
-Bye.
-See ya.

05:50.725 --> 05:53.770
Well, you did it.
You rethroupled them.

05:56.981 --> 05:58.983
-Yeah, I did.

05:59.984 --> 06:02.278
-Welcome to the neighbourhood.
-Thank you.

06:50.118 --> 06:52.203
Oh, no. Are you okay?

06:52.286 --> 06:54.956
Oh, my God.

06:55.039 --> 06:58.209
One of the best
romantic comedies of our time?

06:58.292 --> 07:01.045
Yeah. It's my mom's
favourite movie.

07:01.129 --> 07:04.132
It was... kinda rape-y.

07:04.215 --> 07:05.424
Sorry.

07:06.342 --> 07:08.136
Yeah, I don't remember it
being that rape-y,

07:08.219 --> 07:10.930
but Ivy League there got a little...
little handsy.

07:11.013 --> 07:13.099
-True.
-I mean, the whole thing was just weird.

07:13.182 --> 07:15.977
The fact that the guy is
a pathological liar?

07:16.060 --> 07:18.354
-He's... he's one person...
-Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.

07:18.438 --> 07:21.524
And then he's Rex Stetson,
and then he still gets the girl.

07:21.607 --> 07:22.984
I thought that movie was bullshit.

07:23.067 --> 07:24.819
Have you ever listened
to Doris Day's Christmas album?

07:24.902 --> 07:26.237
How did we get there?

07:35.329 --> 07:38.291
From the time I could run,

07:38.374 --> 07:41.752
I chased my Dad's car down the street
until my Mom caught me.

07:41.836 --> 07:44.797
The older I got, the further I got.
It was impressive.

07:44.881 --> 07:46.757
Did he ever stop?
No.

07:46.841 --> 07:49.218
My Mom said if he stopped,
I'd never learn.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.387
Ouch. That sucks.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.222
Did I tell you I paint?

07:53.306 --> 07:56.392
-Definitely not.
-It's highly therapeutic.

07:56.476 --> 07:59.020
I suck at it, though, so I call it
"abstract expressionism"

07:59.103 --> 08:02.899
because, I mean...
who's gonna know?

08:03.441 --> 08:05.193
So...

08:05.276 --> 08:08.029
-I just... handfuls.

08:08.112 --> 08:10.198
I'm going through
a Pollock phase right now.

08:10.281 --> 08:12.450
My grandma thinks I'm a genius.

08:14.285 --> 08:16.245
<i>What?</i>

08:16.329 --> 08:18.581
<i>Oh, come on.</i>
<i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

08:18.664 --> 08:20.374
<i>We're sharing.</i>
<i>There's no holding back.</i>

08:20.458 --> 08:22.460
<i>Well, I kinda...</i>

08:22.543 --> 08:24.712
I kinda sorta want my own bar.

08:26.214 --> 08:28.049
I mean, I've been saving up,

08:28.132 --> 08:30.259
and I've got a couple investors
that are interested.

08:32.303 --> 08:35.556
That is extremely cool, Shaun.

08:37.892 --> 08:41.437
<i> Okay, say it for real.</i>
<i>Say what?</i>

08:41.521 --> 08:45.274
<i>Well, leave out the "kinda sorta"</i>
<i>and tell the universe what you want.</i>

08:45.358 --> 08:47.068
I want my own bar.

08:47.151 --> 08:48.778
Lame.

08:48.861 --> 08:51.739
Is that so hard? Yell it.

08:56.077 --> 08:57.787
-I'm holding on.

08:57.870 --> 09:00.915
-I want my own bar!
-He wants his own bar!

09:00.998 --> 09:03.960
-I want my own fucking bar!
-Whoo!

09:04.043 --> 09:05.711
Said every drunk ever!

09:05.795 --> 09:07.880
Thank you!
Move along.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.674
Nice.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.010
Hey, thanks for never judging me
about the escort thing.

09:13.094 --> 09:15.972
I think it just made me feel...

09:16.389 --> 09:18.432
I don't know, in control?

09:18.516 --> 09:20.726
Well, paddling a dude
who's wearing a dog collar

09:20.810 --> 09:23.187
and nipple clamps,
that would do it.

09:23.271 --> 09:24.814
None of us are in control, really.

09:24.897 --> 09:28.484
If you can accept that,
it's actually all very exciting.

09:33.447 --> 09:37.368
I-I didn't realize how badly
I needed a night like this.

09:37.451 --> 09:38.786
Thank you.

09:40.454 --> 09:43.833
Go on. Get it over with.

09:43.916 --> 09:46.502
Jerk the rug out
from underneath me.

09:49.130 --> 09:50.006
No.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.133
Not this time.

10:12.945 --> 10:14.822
Okay, I, um...

10:15.656 --> 10:18.743
I g... just need to walk away now.

10:18.826 --> 10:19.744
Yep.

10:30.379 --> 10:32.006
You know, if it's a girl...

10:32.089 --> 10:34.675
...we should totally name her Eji.

10:37.136 --> 10:39.055
Yeah, then we can go straight
from cutting the cord

10:39.138 --> 10:40.431
to giving her
a belly button ring.

10:40.514 --> 10:43.809
Yeah. Buy her a little
training stripper pole.

10:45.353 --> 10:47.271
Foster an addiction
to infant cough medicine.

10:47.355 --> 10:49.523
"More sizzurp, Mommy."

10:49.607 --> 10:51.150
Aw.

10:51.233 --> 10:53.110
Ah, I forgot.

10:53.194 --> 10:56.614
Oh, I will respond to Mamacita
and Mamacita only.

10:56.697 --> 10:59.116
So we're really doing it?

10:59.867 --> 11:03.162
Yeah. Just a guy, his ex,
and their girlfriend

11:03.245 --> 11:04.705
raising a baby together.

11:04.789 --> 11:07.500
Seriously, if it's a girl,
and we don't call her Rita,

11:07.583 --> 11:09.835
my mother will never speak
to any of us ever again...

11:09.919 --> 11:11.545
Oh, seriously,
if you <i>do</i> name her Rita

11:11.629 --> 11:13.172
and you can't make it 1957,

11:13.255 --> 11:15.049
your daughter will never
speak to you again.

11:15.132 --> 11:17.218
As long as we avoid plants or herbs.

11:17.301 --> 11:21.055
I have four patients named Sage,
three Willows, and a Fern.

11:21.138 --> 11:23.474
-Yeah, that's exactly my point.

11:23.557 --> 11:25.017
I love Matilda.

11:25.101 --> 11:26.727
I like Matilda.

11:26.811 --> 11:30.022
Yeah, 'cause it can be Maddy, it can be
Tilda. It's like three names in one.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.440
-That's pretty good.
Right?

11:31.524 --> 11:33.442
-We should write these down.
Oh, yeah, yeah.

11:33.526 --> 11:36.153
Hey, what about Riley?
He was my first crush when we were 9.

11:36.237 --> 11:38.948
Every time he smiled at me,
I heard that <i>Breakfast Club</i> song.

11:39.031 --> 11:40.950
-Everyone freeze-framed.
I like it.

11:41.033 --> 11:43.828
We'll do it here.
Matilda.

11:43.911 --> 11:46.622
-And Riley. I like Riley.
-It tickles.

11:46.705 --> 11:48.791
What about Parker?
Hmm.

11:48.874 --> 11:51.377
Sounds kinda douchey, but every
Parker I know has been a winner.

11:51.460 --> 11:54.839
-I like Parker.
-Eh, let's keep going.

11:54.922 --> 11:57.174
-Olivia.
-Too popular.

11:57.258 --> 11:59.260
Jack Jr. Should've put that first.

11:59.343 --> 12:00.511
-No.

12:00.594 --> 12:03.013
-Gotta put that in giant capital letters.

12:03.097 --> 12:06.767
Uh, fair warning:
I... don't change diapers.

12:06.851 --> 12:10.146
Well, I did once,
but I was getting paid double.

12:10.604 --> 12:13.065
-Oh, that is fucking disgusting.

12:13.149 --> 12:14.442
I know.

12:14.525 --> 12:16.944
Okay, well, I already divvied up
the baby duties.

12:17.027 --> 12:20.448
And spoiler alert,
but your lists are super long.

12:20.531 --> 12:22.199
I already work insane hours
at Pinnacle.

12:22.283 --> 12:25.286
And if I make partner,
it's gonna be even worse, so...

12:28.747 --> 12:30.249
Shit.

12:30.332 --> 12:32.126
Sorry, I didn't...

12:32.209 --> 12:34.170
I didn't mean
to make assumptions.

12:34.253 --> 12:36.130
We haven't really
talked about it, so...

12:40.885 --> 12:44.472
I was assuming you were coming home,
not coming to get us.

12:49.477 --> 12:51.562
Oh, it's a war zone.

12:53.397 --> 12:56.984
-Mm. It's Hannah's ring.

12:57.067 --> 12:58.152
Can you just say you're dead?

12:58.235 --> 13:00.529
Is there a response that says,
"I'm dead"

13:00.613 --> 13:02.656
I think she's actually really lonely.

13:02.740 --> 13:05.075
Well, that's what happens
when you fabricate a husband.

13:05.159 --> 13:07.244
I'm kidding. Please.
Go ahead. Feel free.

13:07.328 --> 13:10.331
<i>Fuck, yeah!</i>

13:10.414 --> 13:12.249
Fuck yeah!

13:12.333 --> 13:14.376
Never getting that genie
back in the bottle.

13:14.460 --> 13:15.544
<i>Hello</i>

13:15.628 --> 13:16.921
The counsellor meetings
roll out before us.

13:17.004 --> 13:18.464
<i>Carmen, hold on to your ovaries.</i>

13:18.547 --> 13:21.467
-Um, not a saying.
<i>-Give it time.</i>

13:21.550 --> 13:24.345
<i>Turns out, hunky printer rep's</i>
<i>dad owns the company,</i>

13:24.428 --> 13:25.804
<i>and they want in.</i>

13:25.888 --> 13:29.350
<i>Offices, staff, the whole nine.</i>
<i>How amazing!</i>

13:29.433 --> 13:32.353
Uh, so ama--
Are you kidding me?

13:32.436 --> 13:35.105
<i>Get your skinny ass over here</i>
<i>so we can celebrate! Whoo--</i>

13:35.189 --> 13:37.650
-Oh, my God.

13:38.776 --> 13:41.153
Oh, my God.

13:41.237 --> 13:42.446
Oh, my God.

13:44.865 --> 13:46.534
Well, uh...

13:46.617 --> 13:48.577
I guess shit just got real, huh?

13:48.661 --> 13:50.204
It's okay. We'll figure it out.

13:53.958 --> 13:56.460
-Congratulations.
Thank you.

13:57.419 --> 13:58.796
-Mm. -Mmm.
-Mmm.

14:02.299 --> 14:04.718
I maybe have five minutes.

14:04.802 --> 14:07.179
I only need four,
so you can have a whole minute

14:07.263 --> 14:09.139
for the walk of shame over there.

14:09.223 --> 14:10.266
That's perfect.

14:10.349 --> 14:12.768
Lily shit on my book.

14:13.686 --> 14:14.895
She what?

14:14.979 --> 14:17.606
-I got it.
-No, wait. No, no, no. Hell no.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.442
You get... you get over there
and you go celebrate.

14:20.901 --> 14:23.028
I got this. I'll take care of it. Go on.

14:23.112 --> 14:25.447
So hard tonight.
<i>So</i> hard tonight.

14:28.284 --> 14:29.493
Daddy!

14:29.577 --> 14:32.288
Okay! Yes, shit on a book.
Coming!

14:32.371 --> 14:35.165
-Can't wait to see.

14:35.249 --> 14:37.918
Well, if you get the promotion,
you're gonna be making, like,

14:38.002 --> 14:41.881
a shit ton of money, right?
Like, twice what Jackie makes.

14:41.964 --> 14:44.508
If you're trying to
bruise my ego, it's not working.

14:44.592 --> 14:45.509
No?

14:45.593 --> 14:47.887
I'm fully comfortable
with however much she's making.

14:47.970 --> 14:50.222
-Yeah, a little bit.

14:50.306 --> 14:52.725
Three times as much

14:52.808 --> 14:55.311
-Fuck.

14:55.394 --> 14:58.272
-Testing the limits of my ego.

14:59.982 --> 15:02.318
And as long as we're being honest,

15:02.526 --> 15:03.861
I miss Hawthorne Heights.

15:05.446 --> 15:06.947
What? You never told me that.

15:07.031 --> 15:08.324
I do.

15:10.451 --> 15:12.995
-It's interesting.

15:13.078 --> 15:17.374
In the way that I'd rather
sleep under a fucking bridge.

15:17.458 --> 15:20.669
Come on. How do you not love this place?
It's in the middle of fucking everything.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.254
There's tacos downstairs.

15:22.338 --> 15:25.799
Yeah, except for parking
and grass and trees

15:25.883 --> 15:28.135
and grocery stores
or other children.

15:28.218 --> 15:30.721
Uh, well, bonus point for Seattle;

15:30.804 --> 15:32.514
we could pick out a place together.

15:32.598 --> 15:34.850
Well, this is fucking great, isn't it?

15:34.934 --> 15:36.685
Two-person couples have a hard time

15:36.769 --> 15:39.688
staying on the same page about stuff
like this, where to live, how to live.

15:39.772 --> 15:43.359
Yeah, but we are a democracy,
so we can vote.

15:43.442 --> 15:45.277
-Yeah.
-That's true.

15:45.361 --> 15:48.447
We could, like, make
presentations, each of us.

15:48.530 --> 15:49.949
Give the pluses and minuses.

15:51.784 --> 15:54.370
How about we explore
the more tactile aspects

15:54.453 --> 15:56.246
of an odd
-Mmm.

15:56.330 --> 15:58.624
-I second that motion.
-Third!

15:58.707 --> 16:00.292
Enough with the talking.

16:00.376 --> 16:02.336
In the shrink world,
we call this "avoidance sex."

16:02.419 --> 16:04.171
Works for me!

16:18.602 --> 16:20.854
-Hey.

16:34.410 --> 16:35.995
My mind is blown.

16:36.078 --> 16:38.789
The world has turned upside-down.
Nothing makes sense anymore.

16:39.832 --> 16:40.833
-Neen.

16:40.916 --> 16:41.959
Nana!

16:42.793 --> 16:44.169
You're cleaning the bar.

16:44.253 --> 16:45.963
Oh, my God.

16:46.046 --> 16:48.799
What the fuck?
Should I go home?

16:48.882 --> 16:50.759
-Um...

16:50.843 --> 16:52.886
I don't know.
I don't think so.

16:52.970 --> 16:55.014
I'm a little shaky, though.

16:55.097 --> 16:56.765
-Goddamn it.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.351
Well, I'm highly suggestible to panic.

16:59.435 --> 17:01.353
Oh. Well, maybe you should've
thought of that

17:01.437 --> 17:02.855
before you kissed me.

17:04.106 --> 17:06.442
Yeah, no, you're right.
That makes total fucking sense.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.366
You know what?

17:14.450 --> 17:17.202
For both of our sakes, I think
I'm just gonna take my break now.

17:17.286 --> 17:19.872
-Yeah, that's... that's more like you.
-Yeah.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.374
-You deserve it.
-Mm-hmm.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.585
I mean, look at this. It's...

17:24.668 --> 17:25.836
half-done.

17:25.919 --> 17:27.379
I'm glad this didn't get weird.

17:33.927 --> 17:36.638
-Mmm.
-Mm. Squeeze in.

17:38.348 --> 17:40.684
Mm.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.352
Whatcha working on?

17:42.436 --> 17:45.481
Everything all at once,
as usual. Never stops.

17:45.564 --> 17:47.399
Kind of running out of excuses.

17:47.483 --> 17:49.985
I'm pretty sure I'm in... Hawaii?

17:50.069 --> 17:53.614
I don't know. Definitely an island.
-Thought you were in the hospital.

17:53.697 --> 17:55.699
-Shit, I'm in the hospital. That's right.

17:57.910 --> 18:01.580
My dad. So he's not really crazy

18:01.663 --> 18:03.499
about this... business.

18:03.582 --> 18:06.293
-Yeah. I-I've...

18:06.376 --> 18:08.921
I thought I was telling him
about something I did,

18:09.004 --> 18:10.380
not something I'm doing.

18:12.841 --> 18:13.717
Sorry, Dad.

18:13.801 --> 18:16.136
-Ugh!

18:16.220 --> 18:18.097
Go away.

18:19.306 --> 18:21.517
Seems that the world
has found us.

18:23.936 --> 18:26.438
Okay, enough. Another text,
call, or e-mail, and I'm gonna

18:26.522 --> 18:28.941
have to fake a Code Red
Wellness Centre emergency

18:29.024 --> 18:31.860
so I can just be as cool
and indispensable as you two.

18:31.944 --> 18:34.988
-Fuck!

18:35.072 --> 18:38.534
I forgot about my meeting
with Sasha and her grandma.

18:38.617 --> 18:42.121
-I'm sure she'll be fine, Iz.
-No, she's been let down enough.

18:42.204 --> 18:45.749
She was counting on me, and I...I...

18:45.833 --> 18:48.043
Fuck. I got distracted.

18:48.127 --> 18:51.547
-Hey, Iz. Izzy.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.382
It'll be okay.
You'll figure it out.

18:54.550 --> 18:56.718
-I-I gotta go.

19:32.379 --> 19:34.298
No polish for you.

19:36.300 --> 19:38.385
Sasha, look at me, please.

19:38.468 --> 19:42.389
Hey, can we just skip this part
and go straight to you fucking off?

19:42.472 --> 19:44.433
I'm so sorry.
I lost track of time--

19:44.516 --> 19:46.310
Is that really the best you can do?

19:47.811 --> 19:49.104
You're right.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.732
All that matters is that I <i>fucked</i> up.

19:51.815 --> 19:54.568
And I swear to God,
it'll never happen again.

19:54.651 --> 19:56.612
You got that right.

20:03.744 --> 20:06.038
What happened with your grandma?

20:07.122 --> 20:08.624
Nothing good.

20:09.249 --> 20:12.628
Same selfish, crazy cow
she always was.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.547
Well, maybe we could make
another appointment--

20:15.631 --> 20:18.842
No. It's done. Over.

20:19.092 --> 20:22.429
You don't know her like I do,
so just let it go.

20:23.222 --> 20:26.266
You can't fix me.

20:30.562 --> 20:32.356
Well, what <i>can</i> I do?

20:33.065 --> 20:34.816
You can go away.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.145
Hey.

21:12.229 --> 21:14.147
I had a revelation.

21:15.899 --> 21:17.192
And you wanna talk about it?

21:18.485 --> 21:20.779
Yeah. I do.

21:23.282 --> 21:24.825
I'm glad you could swing this in.

21:24.908 --> 21:27.077
Izzy's at Directions,
and Emma's buried in work.

21:27.160 --> 21:28.996
Ah. Don't worry about it.

21:29.079 --> 21:30.747
I got the kids sleeping right here.

21:30.831 --> 21:32.624
-It's a nice touch.
-Plus, you saved me

21:32.708 --> 21:35.794
from a Reddit wormhole
of Fluppy mythology.

21:35.877 --> 21:38.422
Aren't they all just facets
of the human soul?

21:38.505 --> 21:40.924
Okay, so I'm the only one that
hasn't made that connection?

21:41.008 --> 21:43.468
Wait a minute.
Emma's buried at work?

21:43.552 --> 21:45.053
I thought she was quitting.

21:45.137 --> 21:47.306
Apparently that's TBD.

21:47.389 --> 21:48.473
I beg your pardon?

21:49.308 --> 21:52.394
Yeah. You know, there's a version of this
where we all end up moving to Seattle.

21:52.477 --> 21:55.230
Why in God's name
would you move to Seattle?

21:55.314 --> 21:56.857
If Emma makes managing partner,

21:56.940 --> 21:59.318
she's gonna make, like,
a billion dollars.

22:00.777 --> 22:02.362
What about you?
You okay with that?

22:02.446 --> 22:04.239
-If it was up to me,

22:04.323 --> 22:06.325
I'd move back to Hawthorne Heights
tomorrow. You know that.

22:06.408 --> 22:08.452
What about Izzy?
She wants to move to Seattle?

22:08.535 --> 22:12.539
No clue. We had sex just
so we could stop talking about it.

22:12.789 --> 22:16.168
I thought the whole move here
was Emma gets pregnant,

22:16.251 --> 22:18.795
snaps the fuck out of it,
and comes home.

22:20.422 --> 22:22.841
I guess that was the plan
originally, but...

22:25.052 --> 22:26.636
I don't know, man.

22:27.846 --> 22:30.182
I mean, I... I guess...

22:35.896 --> 22:36.855
Don't move.

22:37.481 --> 22:39.274
I will not. I will stay perfectly still.

22:39.357 --> 22:40.567
-I won't even breathe.
-Okay.

22:40.650 --> 22:43.779
-I mean, don't leave Portland, Jack.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.699
I lost Emma once
just because I was too fixated

22:47.783 --> 22:51.369
on my version of our life.
I can't do that again.

22:52.704 --> 22:55.540
What if I cry?
Will that change anything?

22:55.624 --> 22:58.001
It would make me immediately
lose all respect for you.

22:58.085 --> 22:59.127
Mm-hmm.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.129
You wanna go back
to playing basketball?

23:01.213 --> 23:02.631
-I would love that, yeah.
-Okay.

23:12.724 --> 23:14.101
Hey, you're back so soon.

23:14.184 --> 23:16.937
Yeah. Somehow,
I ended up at the zoo.

23:17.020 --> 23:18.688
-I'm drunk. Yeah.
-Oh.

23:18.980 --> 23:21.691
Who squeezes more out of
a 5

23:21.775 --> 23:25.028
Uh...

23:25.112 --> 23:27.739
Look, I've, uh, been
giving it a lot of thought,

23:27.823 --> 23:31.660
and... what if you really are
Mr. Right There in Front of Me?

23:34.621 --> 23:36.081
Well, how do we find out?

23:36.164 --> 23:37.833
Well, we need to kiss again.

23:38.959 --> 23:40.460
-Yeah.

23:40.544 --> 23:42.462
I mean, it could've been a fluke,

23:42.546 --> 23:46.675
like you closed your eyes
and accidentally hit a home run.

23:46.758 --> 23:50.345
I'm so happy to hear you say that,
'cause I felt like I made solid contact.

23:50.428 --> 23:52.430
-Mm-hmm.
Hey.
