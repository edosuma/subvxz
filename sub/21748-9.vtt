00:13.596 --> 00:15.849
Class, settle down. Settle down.

00:15.932 --> 00:18.852
It's Ruthie's turn
to present her ancestor.

00:18.935 --> 00:21.521
-Go ahead, Ruthie.
-Okay, Teach-Bot.

00:21.604 --> 00:23.857
-Mrs. Teach-Bot.
-Ugh.

00:23.940 --> 00:27.152
My great-great-great grandmother
was called Princess Carolyn.

00:27.235 --> 00:29.529
She was an agent
and a manager in Hollywoo.

00:29.612 --> 00:32.449
What's the difference
between an agent and a manager?

00:32.532 --> 00:34.284
Both look to find projects
for their clients

00:34.367 --> 00:35.660
but only managers can produce.

00:35.744 --> 00:37.620
-[class murmuring]
-What?

00:37.704 --> 00:41.833
My mom told me that I come
from a long line of strong female cats.

00:41.916 --> 00:45.628
Princess Carolyn was the runt of 12
and it made her one of the toughest.

00:45.712 --> 00:48.506
Mom said, "She could take a lickin'
and keep on tickin'."

00:48.590 --> 00:50.717
This expression refers to clocks,

00:50.800 --> 00:52.260
an old fashioned way of timekeeping

00:52.343 --> 00:54.846
before we all universally accepted
the bean system.

00:54.929 --> 00:57.599
[class]
"The bean system is the way."

00:57.682 --> 00:59.434
For Ancestry Day, I'm gonna tell you

00:59.517 --> 01:02.103
a particular story
about one particular day

01:02.187 --> 01:06.024
on which Princess Carolyn faced
and overcame particular adversity

01:06.107 --> 01:10.236
all the way back in the year 2017.

01:11.488 --> 01:13.865
-[Ruthie] <i>The day began like any other.</i>
-[groans]

01:13.948 --> 01:16.451
[Ruthie] <i>Princess Carolyn lived</i>
<i>with her boyfriend, Ralph.</i>

01:16.534 --> 01:19.120
-<i>She was pregnant and very happy.</i>
-[sighs]

01:19.204 --> 01:20.789
Sorry I can't go with you
to the doctor.

01:20.872 --> 01:23.333
-Don't worry about it. I feel great!
-Today is crucial.

01:23.416 --> 01:25.210
Stilton Cards has to create
its own holiday

01:25.293 --> 01:26.836
to really be playing with the big boys.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.463
Hallmark, American Greeting,

01:28.546 --> 01:30.632
those chunky cards that play music
when you open them.

01:30.715 --> 01:33.760
I just know you're gonna be
the next Joey K. Easter,

01:33.843 --> 01:35.053
the guy who invented Arbor Day.

01:35.136 --> 01:37.222
How about
"National Friend of a Friend Day?"

01:37.305 --> 01:39.516
-Is that anything?
-You'll think of something.

01:39.599 --> 01:40.767
[slurps]
Mm!

01:40.850 --> 01:43.686
Give me just a sip of the coffee.
I can have a sip.

01:43.770 --> 01:46.815
-One sip.
-Today is going to be great.

01:46.898 --> 01:48.316
Oh--!
[yelps]

01:48.399 --> 01:49.609
-Hey.
-[moans] Oh-hh!

01:49.692 --> 01:50.693
[Ruthie] <i>She was wrong.</i>

01:50.777 --> 01:52.987
<i>Today was gonna suck.</i>

01:53.863 --> 01:56.699
[theme music playing]

02:48.877 --> 02:51.921
[Ruthie] <i>Princess Carolyn started her day</i>
<i>with a call to BoJack Horseman,</i>

02:52.005 --> 02:54.257
<i>her former client-slash-lover.</i>

02:54.340 --> 02:57.510
-Ruthie! Inappropriate!
-Sorry.

02:58.344 --> 02:59.846
[BoJack] <i>Go for BoJack!</i>

02:59.929 --> 03:01.931
You like that?
I'm trying out some new phone stuff.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.934
Or is "Bo for GoJack" better?
Nah, maybe too clever.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.395
I don't want people to think I'm trying.
Sorry, who is this?

03:07.478 --> 03:08.938
Princess Carolyn, moron.

03:09.022 --> 03:12.942
-Oh, hey, P.C. So what do you think?
-About what?

03:13.026 --> 03:14.777
"Go for BoJack!" Or maybe--

03:14.861 --> 03:17.280
Ugh, stop!
You need to get a new agent.

03:17.363 --> 03:18.781
I'm sick of fielding your offers.

03:18.865 --> 03:21.618
Offers? Well, you tell them
that I am not doing another reality show.

03:21.701 --> 03:22.577
So degrading.

03:22.660 --> 03:25.997
All they had at craft services
was Kirkland snacks, P.C. <i>Kirkland snacks.</i>

03:26.080 --> 03:29.667
Well, first of all, I don't work for you,
so I'm not gonna tell anyone anything.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.878
But, second,
these are actually good offers.

03:31.961 --> 03:33.963
-Really? Like what?
-I'm not telling you because--

03:34.047 --> 03:36.758
Got it. Busy, busy. I'm busy too,
so I'll call you back later. Bye.

03:36.841 --> 03:39.802
-<i>Don't call. I don't work for you!</i>
-How's this for a headline for the blog?

03:39.886 --> 03:42.722
You write about this, quote,
"BoJack Finally Solves Mystery

03:42.805 --> 03:45.099
of Hollyhock's Mother,
comma, Looks Handsome,

03:45.183 --> 03:47.143
colon: Is Cool." End quote.

03:47.227 --> 03:50.063
I still don't understand your plan,
or how that's a headline.

03:50.146 --> 03:52.398
The plan couldn't be simpler.
Go to the county courthouse,

03:52.482 --> 03:55.068
ask to see all the birth certificates
on file, find Hollyhock's,

03:55.151 --> 03:56.653
see what it says in the "mother" spot.

03:56.736 --> 03:58.905
They're not just gonna give you
the birth certificates.

03:58.988 --> 04:01.407
Well, I gotta try something.
I have this girl at my house

04:01.491 --> 04:03.534
who came to me for help,
I want to do right by her.

04:03.618 --> 04:05.370
I just don't know
if you've thought through--

04:05.453 --> 04:08.915
Diane, I am a famous.
They will give me the birth certificate.

04:08.998 --> 04:11.251
Everyone gives me everything I want
all the time.

04:11.334 --> 04:15.004
It is an existential curse,
but a huge day-to-day convenience.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.757
-So why do you need me?
-I don't know. Just wanted some company.

04:17.840 --> 04:20.218
You told me to use a vacation day
because this was, quote,

04:20.301 --> 04:22.095
"a feminism-related emergency."

04:22.178 --> 04:24.806
-I got your number!
-Why didn't you just bring Hollyhock?

04:24.889 --> 04:27.600
I was gonna, but she got really
into counting her teeth this morning,

04:27.684 --> 04:29.811
didn't want to leave the house.
You know how teens are.

04:29.894 --> 04:33.398
Ruthie, this was supposed to be
about your ancestor.

04:33.481 --> 04:37.151
-Who are all these other "chara-ca-ters"?
-They fill out the world.

04:37.235 --> 04:39.404
Well, can you try
to keep things focused, please?

04:39.487 --> 04:40.655
Okay, okay, okay.

04:40.738 --> 04:43.658
[Ruthie] <i>Princess Carolyn had been</i>
<i>called to Gekko-Rabitowitz--</i>

04:43.741 --> 04:47.161
<i>the agency of her nemesis,</i>
<i>and nemesis-slash-former lover.</i>

04:47.245 --> 04:48.663
-Ruthie!
-Sorry, Teach-Bot.

04:48.746 --> 04:50.248
She had a lot of former lovers.

04:50.331 --> 04:52.625
She was a fluid sexual being,
not a machine.

[Ruthie]
<i>But today was all about business.</i>

04:54.711 --> 04:56.629

<i>Courtney Portnoy cast in--</i>

04:58.965 --> 05:02.885
<i>Corpse Me If You Can-Can</i>, the 1940's
Cannes, France-set story

05:02.969 --> 05:05.179
of a can-can dancer who contracts cancer

05:05.263 --> 05:07.598
but continues to can-can
as a canny cadaver

05:07.682 --> 05:10.226
who plays the accordion
with Kevin Corrigan, Kevin Kline,

05:10.310 --> 05:12.186
Chris Klein, Chris Pine and Chris Kattan.

05:12.270 --> 05:14.564
-Got it.
-[gasps] Gekko.

05:14.647 --> 05:17.942
Princess Carolyn, hi! Love the dress.

05:18.026 --> 05:21.029
Is it new, or something I've seen you wear
literally hundreds of times?

05:21.112 --> 05:23.364
[Ruthie] <i>Normally, Princess Carolyn</i>
<i>would've been rattled,</i>

05:23.448 --> 05:27.869
<i>but that day, she realized Vanessa Gekko</i>
<i>no longer had any power over her.</i>

05:27.952 --> 05:31.748
<i>In truth, the woman had challenged</i>
<i>and inspired Princess Carolyn,</i>

05:31.831 --> 05:33.333
<i>not only to be a better agent,</i>

05:33.416 --> 05:35.960
<i>but to be brave enough</i>
<i>to try and have it all.</i>

05:36.044 --> 05:40.298
<i>Princess Carolyn wanted to tell her</i>
<i>thank you, but instead she said...</i>

05:40.381 --> 05:43.718
-You look tired, "Veronica."
-Oh, I--

05:43.801 --> 05:45.678
Amazing burn, Princess Carolyn.

05:45.762 --> 05:49.098
Hey, Princess. We have a little snag.

05:49.182 --> 05:52.310
Did Chris Kattan drop out?
Right before his comeback?

05:52.393 --> 05:55.605
Right when the world is finally ready
to settle for Kattan?

05:55.688 --> 05:57.565
-No, it's--
-You're fired.

05:57.648 --> 05:59.108
I'm <i>fired?</i>

05:59.192 --> 06:01.819
I tried to talk her out of it,
but between the gun movie misfiring

06:01.903 --> 06:04.197
and her nuptials
turning into "nope-tials,"

06:04.280 --> 06:06.616
and her blaming you
for both of those things...

06:06.699 --> 06:10.411
Who knew Portnoy had so many complaints?
Oh, just give me one more chance.

06:10.495 --> 06:13.873
I promise I can get you the lead
in that can-can cadaver movie.

06:13.956 --> 06:15.333
[laughs] What?

06:15.416 --> 06:20.046
Oh, P.C., C.P. just made
that whole thing up to get you here.

06:20.129 --> 06:21.297
You thought that was real?

06:21.380 --> 06:25.927
The 1940's corpse who learns accordion?
It sounds so ludicrous.

06:26.010 --> 06:30.264
You did play the short-sighted seamstress
in <i>The Storm on Northern Fortress.</i>

06:30.348 --> 06:33.559
Well, yeah, but that was just because
I wanted to work with Ashton.

06:33.643 --> 06:35.937
We'll talk later, right?
I'm so sorry. Bye.

06:36.813 --> 06:40.108
Did you have a good meeting?
[mockingly] Did you get fired?

06:40.191 --> 06:41.400
[groans] Aw.

06:44.529 --> 06:46.239
Sorry you got fired. Here's a latte.

06:46.531 --> 06:47.490
Oh, uh--

06:47.573 --> 06:49.742
-It's decaf, ma'am.
-Thanks, Judah.

06:49.826 --> 06:51.911
You know, one year ago,
a setback like this

06:51.994 --> 06:53.454
would have really spun me out.

06:53.538 --> 06:54.705
But I don't need Courtney.

06:54.789 --> 06:58.084
Every time we fall, we get back up
stronger and better than ever.

06:58.167 --> 07:00.920
-Can I get a hallelujah?
-Is that a sort of pressed juice?

07:01.003 --> 07:03.172
I'll have one hallelujah
on your desk by 12:45.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.215
Great. What's next?

07:04.298 --> 07:07.009
I noticed your necklace was broken,
so I pushed back your appointment,

07:07.093 --> 07:08.636
and found a reputable jeweler nearby.

07:08.719 --> 07:11.264
Don't know what I'd do without you,
my hairy number two!

07:11.347 --> 07:13.349
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
That came out horribly.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.934
Not to speak above my station,

07:15.017 --> 07:18.563
but perhaps it would behoove us to entice
BoJack Horseman back into our stable.

07:18.646 --> 07:19.814
-Ugh!
-I'm sorry, ma'am.

07:19.897 --> 07:21.858
"Stable" and "behoove"
were poor word choices.

07:21.941 --> 07:24.277
I was not trying to engage in punnery
during business hours,

07:24.360 --> 07:27.738
but we've received 15 more inquiries
about BoJack just this morning,

07:27.822 --> 07:31.617
and I don't think it's wise to look
a gift... opportunity in the mouth.

07:31.701 --> 07:35.204
BoJack is off the table.
We're a small management company.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.206

Can't wait to get back
in front of the camera,

07:55.808 --> 07:59.937
but right now, I have to help my former
political rival defeat my two ex-wives.

08:00.021 --> 08:01.981
One of whom is in the pocket
of powerful lobbyists

08:02.064 --> 08:03.941
and the other of whom
murdered popular actor

08:04.025 --> 08:06.694

08:10.198 --> 08:11.908
Gotta go. They need all hands on deck,

08:11.991 --> 08:14.076
because Woodchuck
lost his hands underground

08:14.160 --> 08:16.454
and they replaced them
with creepy lobster claws.

08:16.537 --> 08:17.914
Typical politics!

08:22.001 --> 08:25.379
Hey. So I need this clasp replaced,
24-karat gold.

08:25.463 --> 08:28.674
This is a priceless family heirloom.

Oh, right. That offer.

when he said you weren't interested.

10:15.239 --> 10:18.826
Well, yeah. Because I wasn't,
and he does what I say.

10:18.909 --> 10:21.579
So I guess it all worked out for everyone.

10:21.662 --> 10:23.414
You got to start over as a manager,

10:23.497 --> 10:26.500
and instead of buying VIM,
I bought the Utah Jazz.

10:26.584 --> 10:28.961
They're terrible agents,
but they're getting better.

10:29.045 --> 10:31.088
-Yeah.
-Anyway, nice bumping into--

10:31.172 --> 10:32.882
-Oh, sorry.
-Careful, please. Ooh.

10:32.965 --> 10:34.383
-[Charley] Oopsie. Oh, boy.
-No, no.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.926
-[crashes]
-Is that valuable? It is.

10:36.010 --> 10:39.513
My great, great, great grandmother
was dismayed that her trusted colleague

10:39.597 --> 10:40.848
had kept this from her.

10:40.931 --> 10:43.809
<i>Her mind raced,</i>
<i>"Was Judah capable of deception?"</i>

10:43.893 --> 10:46.312
<i>She hoped what Charley told her</i>
<i>wasn't true,</i>

10:46.395 --> 10:49.732
<i>but her instincts told her</i>
<i>the frog wasn't smart enough to lie.</i>

10:49.815 --> 10:52.777
First quarter, second quarter.
Wow, that's a lot of quarters.

10:52.860 --> 10:54.278
Oh, excuse me. Hello.

10:54.362 --> 10:57.823
Judah, you'll never guess
who I just ran into.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.575
No, I won't. Very astute, ma'am.

10:59.659 --> 11:02.787
-It was Charley Witherspoon!
-Mm-hmm.

11:02.870 --> 11:05.164
-Char... ley...
-Hmm...? Hmm!

11:05.247 --> 11:07.166
-Wither... spoon!
-Hmm.

11:07.249 --> 11:09.877
-Okay.
-How does that make you feel?

11:09.960 --> 11:11.712
That very short story
makes me feel nothing.

11:11.796 --> 11:13.631
I don't think it's your fault
as a storyteller.

11:13.714 --> 11:15.508
I often have trouble engaging
with narratives.

11:15.591 --> 11:17.968
[Ruthie] <i>His lack of response</i>
<i>made her hope it wasn't true.</i>

11:18.052 --> 11:19.970
<i>Could it all have been a misunderstanding</i>

11:20.054 --> 11:22.348
<i>involving an enigmatic stranger</i>
<i>named "Judo"?</i>

11:22.431 --> 11:25.518
So, what's next, then?

11:25.601 --> 11:28.396
Ooh, I want to get the life rights
to that woman I saw on Instagram

11:28.479 --> 11:29.605
who had a pretty coffee.

11:29.688 --> 11:34.068
I bet we could attach Jessica Alba
and Jonathan Taylor-Thomas by lunch.

11:34.151 --> 11:37.238
Okay, but I still don't understand
what a manager <i>is.</i>

11:37.321 --> 11:39.865
Do they just say the names
of movies and actors?

11:39.949 --> 11:41.659
How does that generate revenue?

11:41.742 --> 11:43.702
No one knows, Torf. It's not important!

11:43.786 --> 11:45.871
Be quiet, Torf. Take your Hush Pill.

11:45.955 --> 11:47.873
Yes, Miss Teach--
[gulps]

11:47.957 --> 11:49.333
Uh-hh...

11:49.417 --> 11:52.503
-Continue your presentation, Ruthie.
-Thank you.

11:52.586 --> 11:55.881
-And finally, Rob Lowe.
-Great idea, Princess Carolyn.

11:55.965 --> 11:58.551
But is it possible you've forgotten
your doctor's appointment?

11:58.634 --> 12:00.136
-Oh, fish!
-It's my fault.

12:00.219 --> 12:02.721
I rescheduled it in an attempt
to make your life easier.

12:02.805 --> 12:06.434
Thank you, Judah! I'll call you
if I think of any more actor names.

12:10.354 --> 12:12.648
[sighs]
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba...

12:12.731 --> 12:15.359
-God, this is taking forever.
-We've been waiting for 15 minutes.

12:15.443 --> 12:16.735
I know. Let's just go home.

12:16.819 --> 12:18.779
No, Diane.
How could you even suggest that?

12:18.863 --> 12:20.823
This is not about us.
This is for my daughter.

12:20.906 --> 12:22.199
-Ugh.
-I know what I have to do.

12:22.283 --> 12:23.534
Excuse me, excuse me. Pardon me.

12:23.617 --> 12:25.411
Important celebrity doing the right thing.

12:25.494 --> 12:29.707
-Whoa, a famous guy!
-And he's doing the right thing?

12:29.790 --> 12:32.918
This is like when George Clooney
married that less famous lady!

12:33.002 --> 12:36.505
-Wait. Don't you mean Jurj Clooners?
-Who cares?

12:36.589 --> 12:38.007
Hello, friend.

12:38.090 --> 12:40.342
-Yes, it's me, BoJack Hor--
-Number?

12:40.426 --> 12:42.470
I'm sorry, I don't give out
my personal phone number.

12:42.553 --> 12:46.307
No, your number. You need a number
or I can't help you, BoJack Hor.

12:46.390 --> 12:49.852
Horseman. It's Horseman.
I don't look familiar to you at all?

12:49.935 --> 12:52.521
-Eh.
-Come on, BoJack. Let's get a number.

12:52.605 --> 12:55.274
Wait a minute. You're Diane Nguyen!

12:55.357 --> 12:57.693
I recognize you
from your <i>Girl Croosh </i>avatar.

12:57.776 --> 13:00.613
I loved "Twenty Reasons
to Try the Diva Cup."

13:00.696 --> 13:04.658
Oh, wow, thanks! You didn't think
20 was too many reasons?

13:04.742 --> 13:08.412
-No way. Number 14 blew my mind!
-Didn't I say it would?

13:08.496 --> 13:10.289
We don't have time.
Where do we get a number?

13:10.372 --> 13:11.832
-That line.
-What?

13:11.916 --> 13:14.001
And you'll need these-- [grunts]
forms.

13:14.084 --> 13:16.504
Ow, paper cut! Who still uses paper?

13:16.587 --> 13:18.339
Can't I just swipe an app or something?

13:18.422 --> 13:21.300
-Bye, Diane! Keep up the great work!
-[giggles]

13:21.383 --> 13:23.427
Oh, get over yourself.

13:27.014 --> 13:28.849
-[sighs]
-[door opens]

13:28.933 --> 13:31.852
-So? What's the prognosis?
-Hmm...

13:31.936 --> 13:34.396
I'm trying to think of the best way
to put this.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.148
As Charles Lindbergh would say,

13:36.232 --> 13:39.443
"Sometimes you fly an airplane,
and sometimes you lose a baby."

13:39.527 --> 13:41.654
In this case, you didn't fly the airplane.

13:41.737 --> 13:42.780
Wait, what?

13:42.863 --> 13:44.782
Your pregnancy is no longer viable.

13:45.449 --> 13:48.118
Well, how do we make it viable again?

13:48.202 --> 13:49.245
Mm-mm...

13:49.828 --> 13:50.829
How did this happen?

13:50.913 --> 13:51.830
Goodness, I don't know.

13:51.914 --> 13:55.084
I wouldn't beat yourself up.
Miscarriages happen for so many reasons.

13:55.167 --> 13:59.004
There's nothing medically wrong with you.
Maybe you just wanted the baby too much.

13:59.088 --> 14:01.382
Maybe you didn't deserve it
because you were unkind once.

14:01.465 --> 14:05.094
Maybe you ran afoul of a trickster god
or wood nymph who is now exacting revenge.

14:05.177 --> 14:08.639
Oof!
This is... a lot.

14:08.722 --> 14:11.809
Not for me. This is my job,
so... pretty regular day.

14:11.892 --> 14:12.977
What do I do next?

14:13.060 --> 14:15.646
Well, there's a procedure.
We can do it here later this week.

14:15.729 --> 14:17.731
You want Darlene to call someone
to drive you home?

14:17.815 --> 14:20.651
No, I'm okay. I don't need anyone.

14:20.734 --> 14:24.572
You're a real tough broad.
Except for, you know, the uterus area.

14:24.655 --> 14:25.698
Pretty weak.

14:28.409 --> 14:29.451
[gasps]

14:30.828 --> 14:33.497
-Hey, is my necklace ready?
-Oh, I was going to call you.

14:33.581 --> 14:35.916
When I was working on your necklace,
I realized something.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.710
-Oh?
-It's not actually gold,

14:37.793 --> 14:40.254
it's just gold plated. See?

14:40.838 --> 14:42.923
No, it's very expensive.

14:43.007 --> 14:45.509
It's pretty, but basically worthless.

14:45.593 --> 14:47.803
And I'm only saying it's pretty
to make you feel better.

14:47.887 --> 14:52.349
But, it's from the old country.
It's been in my family for generations.

14:52.433 --> 14:55.811
No, this is costume jewelry
from J.C. Penney.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.981
Circa 1963.
Somebody just told you a story.

14:59.064 --> 15:01.066
-I'm sorry.
-Wha-- huh?

15:01.150 --> 15:07.156
So, do you still want a 24-karat gold
clasp on this garbage necklace, or...?

15:08.949 --> 15:11.577
[sniffles] Oh-hh!

15:12.494 --> 15:14.914
[gasps, sobs]

15:22.171 --> 15:23.881
-[ringtone plays]
-Oh!

15:25.174 --> 15:26.550
Ralph, hey!

15:26.634 --> 15:29.053
Hi, honey. Just checking
on how the doctor's appointment went

15:29.136 --> 15:32.264
and also to wish you a happy
"Acknowledge Your Gardener Day."

15:32.348 --> 15:33.807
It's a work in progress. Don't judge.

15:33.891 --> 15:36.101
The doctor's appointment got pushed back.

15:36.185 --> 15:37.895
I'm actually just walking in now.

15:37.978 --> 15:41.732
Oh, hello. Yes, it's me, Princess Carolyn,
here for my appointment.

15:41.815 --> 15:43.150
I like your perfume.

15:43.233 --> 15:45.402
There is a painting of a lake on the wall.

15:45.486 --> 15:47.446
You sure it's okay I'm not there with you?

15:47.529 --> 15:49.073
Ralph, it's fine. I'm a big girl.

15:49.156 --> 15:51.408
Everything is so easy with you,
Princess Carolyn.

15:51.492 --> 15:53.577
I mean, that's why I love you.

15:53.661 --> 15:55.037
Yeah, easy. [chuckles]

15:55.120 --> 15:57.414
That's what the boys in high school
liked about me, too.

15:57.498 --> 15:59.500
[chuckles]
Okay, I'll see you tonight.

15:59.583 --> 16:01.085
-<i>I love you.</i>
-I love you, too.

16:01.168 --> 16:02.419
[beeps]

16:02.962 --> 16:04.380
[sighs]

16:06.090 --> 16:08.175
[slurps, moans]

16:09.551 --> 16:12.680
Oh, I didn't realize you were still here.
Do you need anything else before I go?

16:12.763 --> 16:14.515
No. Thank you.

16:14.598 --> 16:16.100
Should you be drinking that?

16:16.183 --> 16:18.143
You don't always know
what's best for me, Judah.

16:18.227 --> 16:19.770
Is everything okay, Princess Carolyn?

16:19.853 --> 16:23.232
Charley Witherspoon
made you an offer to buy Vim,

16:23.315 --> 16:26.860
and you went over my head
and turned him down without telling me.

16:26.944 --> 16:27.778
Oh.

16:27.861 --> 16:30.072
-So it's true. You lied to me.
-Yes.

16:30.155 --> 16:32.324
Because you didn't want to work
at a big agency.

16:32.408 --> 16:34.076
-You don't fit in with other people.
-I--

16:34.159 --> 16:37.913
You're weird, so you'd rather stay here
where you have all the power.

16:37.997 --> 16:38.998
No, Princess Carolyn--

16:39.081 --> 16:41.834
So you lied to me,
and you made me look like an idiot!

16:41.917 --> 16:45.004
I was trying to protect you. If you heard,
you'd feel like you had to say yes.

16:45.087 --> 16:46.296
I don't need you to protect me.

16:46.380 --> 16:48.382
If you had time, you could decide
what to do next

16:48.465 --> 16:50.009
on your own terms, which you did.

16:50.092 --> 16:51.677
Well, that's not your decision to make.

16:51.760 --> 16:53.679
Princess Carolyn,
I understand you're upset.

16:53.762 --> 16:55.264
-And perhaps your emotions--
-No.

16:55.347 --> 16:57.850
If I can't trust you,
then I can't work with you.

16:57.933 --> 16:58.767
You're fired.

17:00.436 --> 17:02.229
[sighs]

17:03.022 --> 17:04.773
Thank you for my time here,
Princess Carolyn.

17:04.857 --> 17:07.609
It's been very pleasurable. Until now.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.820
This part is... sad.

17:11.488 --> 17:13.574
Don't forget,
you have reservations at 8:00.

17:13.657 --> 17:15.242
-Thank you, Judah.
-Good night.

17:18.203 --> 17:21.081
Ruthie, this story has gotten really dark.

17:21.165 --> 17:23.000
It has a happy ending. I promise.

17:23.083 --> 17:24.501
Well, can we get there soon?

17:24.585 --> 17:27.963
This assignment
was supposed to be six beans long.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.132
You've already gone on for eight beans.

17:30.215 --> 17:31.425
Okay. I'm almost finished.

17:31.508 --> 17:34.511
But first, let's check in
with BoJack and Diane again.

17:34.595 --> 17:35.804
What have they been up to?

17:35.888 --> 17:38.098
[beeping]
Error. Error.

17:38.182 --> 17:39.933
I'm not leaving
without the certificate!

17:40.017 --> 17:42.603
I danced your dance, lady.
I filled out that form.

17:42.686 --> 17:44.855
But I will not wait in this line anymore.

17:44.938 --> 17:47.566
Not one person in here
offered me a Fiji water,

17:47.649 --> 17:50.486
and I am parched
from all the yelling I've been doing!

17:50.569 --> 17:52.029
BoJack, let's go home.

17:52.112 --> 17:54.990
No, I would like to register
a formal complaint.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.701
-How do I do that?
-Complaints are on the eighth floor.

17:57.785 --> 18:00.829
But you need to fill out an application
for a complaint registration,

18:00.913 --> 18:04.374
which you can get by waiting
in line 12-B on the third floor.

18:05.793 --> 18:07.211
You have won this round.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.422
So Princess Carolyn had to meet Ralph.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.591
<i>But she didn't know how to tell him</i>
<i>what had happened</i>

18:12.674 --> 18:15.219
<i>or how he'd take the news.</i>

18:15.302 --> 18:18.180
Okay, so, what do you think
about "National Paperweight Day"?

18:18.263 --> 18:21.767
"Thanks for keeping my papers in place.
I love you as big as outer space."

18:21.850 --> 18:25.270
Okay, so you'd give that card
to a paperweight?

18:25.354 --> 18:29.024
<i>Ah, Principessa!</i> And <i>Signor </i>Stilton.
Welcome-a back.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.651
Let's have a drink then, yes?

18:30.734 --> 18:32.361
I'll have a glass
of Châteauneuf-du-Pape,

18:32.444 --> 18:34.238
the red wine inspired by <i>Scandal.</i>

18:34.321 --> 18:38.075
That Kerry Washington has really brought
red wine into popularity.

18:38.158 --> 18:38.992
It's a-funny,

18:39.076 --> 18:42.121
because I thought that the <i>terroir</i>
of the Italian countryside did it.

18:42.204 --> 18:46.083
-But, a-no, it's-a Miss Kerry Washington.
-Ugh.

18:46.166 --> 18:48.877
Everybody love-a Miss-a Kerry.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.296
And my gal pal here
would love some mint tea. Right?

18:51.380 --> 18:53.882
-You know it.
<i>-Bene, bene.</i>

18:53.966 --> 18:55.717
How was the doctor?
He tell you the species?

18:55.801 --> 18:58.679
I can't stop thinking about squeezing
little Philbert's baby feet.

18:58.762 --> 19:00.722
-Aw-ww...
-[Ruthie] <i>She wanted to tell him.</i>

19:00.806 --> 19:04.726
<i>But she also wanted to let him stay</i>
<i>in his beautiful hopeful reality,</i>

19:04.810 --> 19:08.021
<i>a reality she herself had lived in</i>
<i>just hours before,</i>

19:08.105 --> 19:10.899
<i>and to which she now longed</i>
<i>desperately to return.</i>

19:10.983 --> 19:13.443
Well, the doctor didn't have much info.

19:13.527 --> 19:17.406
You know how doctors are. But he did say
there's nothing wrong with me, so--

19:17.489 --> 19:19.908
-Ah, Miss-a Carrie Underwood.
-Ooh!

19:19.992 --> 19:21.535
-Miss-a Carey Mulligan.
-Agh!

19:21.618 --> 19:25.122
Miss-a Carey, first name Mariah,
right this-a way!

19:25.205 --> 19:27.833
-Ugh!
-Look at all of these Miss-a-Carries!

19:27.916 --> 19:29.418
-[coughing]
