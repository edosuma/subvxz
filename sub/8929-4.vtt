Optimus to command center: scrub the mission.

01:05.276 --> 01:09.378
Looks like one extremely ill wind is blowing our way.

01:09.478 --> 01:13.344
Command center, do you read?

01:19.979 --> 01:23.012
Ah, that does it.

01:23.113 --> 01:26.580
Survey posts are ready for duty.

01:26.680 --> 01:29.013
Mm, any word from Optimus?

01:29.114 --> 01:30.781
Nah, not a flicker.

01:30.881 --> 01:33.948
This storm's trashing the comm links worse than usual.

01:34.048 --> 01:35.782
And that's bad enough.

01:38.348 --> 01:40.749
This mission is too critical

01:40.849 --> 01:44.183
to be interrupted by a minor variation of weather.

01:45.616 --> 01:46.850
( growls )

02:08.320 --> 02:10.654
Some sort of trouble?

02:13.955 --> 02:15.255
( grunts )

02:15.355 --> 02:17.055
Hey, big bot.

02:17.155 --> 02:19.455
( growls )

02:19.555 --> 02:22.856
We're just locking down the old big ba-bang here.

02:22.956 --> 02:25.423
One last adjustment and... ( beeps )

02:25.523 --> 02:29.157
There. We're set to blast that Predacon base back into orbit,

02:29.257 --> 02:31.224
as space debris.

02:36.658 --> 02:38.026
( bomb powers down )

02:39.759 --> 02:42.960
Put it to bed. We're stalled.

02:43.060 --> 02:45.227
What? You're kidding.

02:45.327 --> 02:46.726
What are you talking about?

02:46.826 --> 02:50.460
Hey, it's just a crossed quasar circuit. I can fix it.

02:50.560 --> 02:52.595
That storm will hit us within the hour.

02:52.694 --> 02:56.095
An hour? Not a problem, fellow beast.

02:56.195 --> 02:58.862
I can outrun anything the skies can dish.

02:58.962 --> 03:00.696
Sorry, Cheetor, it's too risky.

03:00.796 --> 03:02.629
The placement of those survey posts

03:02.729 --> 03:05.130
must be thoroughly calculated to avoid contact

03:05.230 --> 03:07.697
with any underground energon deposits.

03:07.797 --> 03:10.197
I'm not just some dippy cub, you know.

03:10.297 --> 03:13.731
I can do this. Try having some faith in me for once.

03:13.831 --> 03:16.031
As much as you prefer to think so, Cheetor,

03:16.132 --> 03:18.031
this isn't about you.

03:18.132 --> 03:20.298
( tense theme playing )

03:26.333 --> 03:29.434
And does it matter if we blow some energon?

03:29.534 --> 03:33.301
Maybe it will take a few Predacons with it.

03:33.402 --> 03:36.635
Well, that is what we want, is it not?

03:36.735 --> 03:39.602
This mission, Dinobot, is to gain tactical advantage

03:39.702 --> 03:41.669
by taking out their base.

03:41.770 --> 03:44.703
Defeating them does not mean we have to annihilate them.

03:44.803 --> 03:47.103
You seem to have trouble understanding that.

03:47.203 --> 03:51.371
What I understand is this.

03:51.470 --> 03:53.671
If situations were reversed,

03:53.772 --> 03:57.105
Megatron would spare the base and annihilate us.

03:59.972 --> 04:02.239
Ah. This eagerness of yours to scrap Megatron

04:02.339 --> 04:03.706
is clouding your judgment.

04:03.806 --> 04:07.540
We are at war, Optimus. War.

04:07.640 --> 04:12.374
I think it is your judgment that is clouded.

04:14.608 --> 04:16.308
( Dinobot growls )

04:16.409 --> 04:18.442
( tense theme playing )

04:21.542 --> 04:25.343
Optimus. They're harmless little scanning relays.

04:25.443 --> 04:29.043
All they're supposed to do is detect Pred energy signatures.

04:29.144 --> 04:30.544
Right, Rhinox?

04:30.644 --> 04:32.511
I'm with Optimus on this one.

04:32.611 --> 04:35.878
Energon's an untested variable.

04:35.978 --> 04:38.112
We gotta be careful.

04:38.211 --> 04:41.179
( tense theme playing )

04:42.479 --> 04:43.880
Come in.

04:45.913 --> 04:48.614
Come to chew my tail for fritzing that bomb?

04:48.714 --> 04:52.415
No. I am confident you can fix it,

04:52.515 --> 04:56.115
just as I am confident you could beat the storm

04:56.214 --> 04:58.282
and plant those survey posts.

04:58.382 --> 05:01.282
Well, then you're the only one who thinks so.

05:01.382 --> 05:04.350
Hm, do not mind Optimus.

05:04.450 --> 05:08.316
To him, you are a mere child,

05:08.417 --> 05:12.084
incapable of handling such an important task.

05:12.184 --> 05:16.818
Like you said, he has no faith.

05:16.918 --> 05:19.886
Yeah, well, I could show him a thing or two.

05:19.986 --> 05:24.219
Then why not do so?

05:24.319 --> 05:25.319
What?

05:25.420 --> 05:28.187
You have mapped every energon deposit

05:28.287 --> 05:29.887
for 500 meters.

05:29.987 --> 05:33.155
And your land speed is unequalled.

05:33.255 --> 05:39.189
In fact, you are the only one who could pull off this mission.

06:32.230 --> 06:33.531
Yup!

07:31.340 --> 07:33.741
Uh-oh. Energon.

07:33.841 --> 07:36.341
And it's gonna blow!

08:24.316 --> 08:28.317
Ah, slag. Just storm interference.

08:28.416 --> 08:31.117
Should have known no Maximal would be stupid enough

08:31.217 --> 08:34.018
to try anything on a day like this.

08:35.884 --> 08:38.652
Okay, so you wanna play rough, eh?

Did I get fried? Is this--

10:09.099 --> 10:11.934
You don't seem so swift to me.

10:12.034 --> 10:14.734
Yeah? Just wait till I get in shape.

10:14.835 --> 10:16.367

10:30.437 --> 10:32.537
Uh-oh.

10:32.637 --> 10:36.138
Scorponok, terrorize!

10:36.238 --> 10:39.872
Waspinator, terrorize!

10:39.972 --> 10:41.439

10:42.972 --> 10:45.306
( dramatic rock theme playing )

10:51.107 --> 10:52.774
CHEETOR: Whoa!

10:55.708 --> 10:57.741
Yeah.

10:57.842 --> 11:01.042
Thanks for showing me the way out, you lamers.

11:04.509 --> 11:05.876
He's gone into the vents.

11:05.976 --> 11:07.843
You better report this to Megatron.

11:07.943 --> 11:11.077
Me? You're second in command.

11:11.177 --> 11:13.744
So? Make it an order.

11:19.545 --> 11:21.745
Uh, where'd he go?

11:22.946 --> 11:24.379
Where'd I go?

11:24.480 --> 11:29.147
Welcome to enemy arms, my former comrade.

11:29.247 --> 11:32.647
I hope you'll enjoy your stay.

11:32.747 --> 11:37.582
Dinobot, maximize!

11:37.682 --> 11:40.149
I don't know how you brought me here, traitor,

11:40.248 --> 11:42.849
but prepare to stain the deck!

11:43.982 --> 11:45.416
( growls )

11:45.516 --> 11:47.283
Wait.

11:47.383 --> 11:51.317
Could it be that an accident of technology and nature

11:51.417 --> 11:54.518
has actually created a transporter?

11:54.617 --> 11:57.718
Hmm, Terrorsaur,

11:57.818 --> 12:02.018
perhaps a truce is in order.

12:02.118 --> 12:05.819
A transporter. Oh, yeah!

12:05.919 --> 12:09.119
So that's how that kid cat ended up in our base.

12:09.220 --> 12:13.254
And you here. Interesting development.

12:13.354 --> 12:16.055
Yeah. Yes.

12:16.155 --> 12:21.722
Say, we could turn a truce into an alliance, Dinobot!

12:21.822 --> 12:24.423
An alliance?

12:24.523 --> 12:26.323
To what end?

12:26.423 --> 12:29.389
Think of the cosmic magnificence.

12:29.490 --> 12:31.624
Together, we'll overthrow

12:31.724 --> 12:34.290
these low-grade metal knockoffs you've joined,

12:34.390 --> 12:38.325
and then rule the Predacons with two iron fists!

12:40.291 --> 12:43.192
Nothing can stop us!

12:44.392 --> 12:46.826
( ominous theme playing )

12:49.227 --> 12:51.060
( panting )

12:53.794 --> 12:55.528
( dramatic theme playing )

13:10.363 --> 13:12.264
I have him. I have him!

13:14.297 --> 13:16.931
( dramatic rock theme playing )

13:23.966 --> 13:25.732
Shredded or sizzled?

13:25.832 --> 13:27.766
What a choice.

13:28.867 --> 13:30.766
( dramatic rock theme playing )

13:38.435 --> 13:40.368
( yowls )

13:46.903 --> 13:48.470
( both yell )

13:49.903 --> 13:53.171
Cheetor, maximize!

13:53.271 --> 13:55.271
Yow!

13:55.371 --> 13:57.638
Bullet train!

13:57.738 --> 14:01.405
Whoa! Unh!

14:01.506 --> 14:03.672
Coming through.

14:03.772 --> 14:09.173
And by simply coming in contact

14:09.273 --> 14:10.974
with the communication console,

14:11.074 --> 14:14.974
this initiated the transport?

14:15.074 --> 14:17.641
That's all I did. Nothing to it.

14:17.741 --> 14:20.475
Excellent.

14:20.575 --> 14:22.308
Then I shall have no difficulty

14:22.408 --> 14:26.276
duplicating the procedure without you.

14:27.576 --> 14:29.776
What? Hey!

14:31.244 --> 14:35.677
Hey, what are you doing? We're partners!

14:35.777 --> 14:39.778
In case you had not realized, needle-nose,

14:39.879 --> 14:43.546
I am not a team player.

14:45.579 --> 14:47.479
( flushes ) Aah!

14:47.579 --> 14:49.713
( screeching )

14:56.448 --> 14:57.815
( growls )

14:57.915 --> 14:59.882
Dinobot, the survey posts are missing,

14:59.982 --> 15:01.149
as is Cheetor.

15:01.249 --> 15:02.982
Do you know anything about it?

15:03.082 --> 15:07.450
Ah, so that's what he was doing out there.

15:07.550 --> 15:09.383
What are you talking about?

15:09.483 --> 15:14.084
I overhead a Predacon communication.

15:14.184 --> 15:16.317
A lightning strike on the sensor posts

15:16.417 --> 15:19.352
has had the unexpected result

15:19.452 --> 15:22.852
of transporting Cheetor into the Predacon base.

15:22.952 --> 15:24.552
Regrettable, yes.

15:24.652 --> 15:29.586
He has surely been destroyed by Megatron.

15:29.686 --> 15:31.153
No!

15:31.254 --> 15:32.487
But take heart in the fact

15:32.587 --> 15:35.587
that through the cat's ultimate sacrifice,

15:35.687 --> 15:39.488
we have been furnished with a way to defeat them.

15:39.588 --> 15:41.421
How?

15:41.522 --> 15:46.022
Somehow the relay posts, the storm and the energon

15:46.122 --> 15:48.656
have all conspired to create a transporter

15:48.756 --> 15:51.790
which connects our comm room to theirs.

15:51.891 --> 15:55.258
We can beam the explosive right into the heart

15:55.358 --> 15:57.825
of Megatron's lair.

16:12.327 --> 16:15.561
Well, as long as I'm here, I might as well roll with it.

16:15.661 --> 16:19.195
Heh, maybe finger some facts like copping their maps

16:19.295 --> 16:21.829
of surrounding energon deposits.

16:23.695 --> 16:25.129
Hold it, hold it, hold it!

16:25.229 --> 16:28.563
Oh, man. Show maximum perimetal grid map.

16:28.663 --> 16:31.197
Add surrounding energon deposits.

16:33.364 --> 16:34.998
( Cheetor growls )

16:35.098 --> 16:38.898
The same energon vein runs under both bases.

16:38.998 --> 16:42.498
And explosion at either base would destroy us all.

16:42.598 --> 16:44.832
Make copy.

16:44.932 --> 16:46.733
I gotta warn Optimus.

16:46.833 --> 16:48.366
SCORPONOK: There he is!

16:50.000 --> 16:51.133
Whoa!

16:53.834 --> 16:55.501
( panting )

16:55.600 --> 16:57.001
( Cheetor growls )

17:00.568 --> 17:02.135
Get out of the way, you--

17:03.168 --> 17:04.702
( both grunt )

17:07.136 --> 17:08.703
OPTIMUS: Wait.

17:09.837 --> 17:12.170
You're positive the detonation countdown

17:12.271 --> 17:14.904
will give the Predacons time to flee the base?

17:15.004 --> 17:17.271
They shall have 30 seconds.

17:17.371 --> 17:20.105
Any more and they might be able to disarm it.

17:20.205 --> 17:21.938
( sighs )

17:22.939 --> 17:24.672
Proceed.

17:24.772 --> 17:26.506
Hm...

17:32.240 --> 17:35.607
Okay, let's take this kiddie home.

17:48.110 --> 17:50.577
Holy cat's meow.

17:50.677 --> 17:53.477
It's the bomb.

17:57.144 --> 17:58.678
What is it?

17:58.778 --> 17:59.912
A data disk.

18:00.012 --> 18:01.078
( sniffs )

18:01.179 --> 18:03.846
And it has Cheetor's scent.

18:03.945 --> 18:05.379
Play this, now.

18:06.879 --> 18:08.946
Oh, they sent the bomb! ( bomb beeping )

18:09.046 --> 18:12.513
I gotta get it out of here before it blows both bases.

18:12.613 --> 18:15.281
Freeze, freckles!

18:15.381 --> 18:20.015
It's as I said, Megatron. One bomb, COD.

18:20.115 --> 18:22.682
Do not attempt to escape, young one.

18:22.782 --> 18:25.416
Terrorsaur, disarm it.

18:25.515 --> 18:27.516
There's no time.

18:27.616 --> 18:28.950
He's right.

18:29.050 --> 18:32.617
It's anchored down and gonna blow in 20 seconds!

18:32.716 --> 18:35.051
I can release the anchors. Let me at it.

18:35.150 --> 18:37.084
Hm...

18:37.185 --> 18:39.151
Come on. You'd rather be vaped?

18:39.251 --> 18:43.052
BOMB: Ten. Nine.

18:44.119 --> 18:45.619
Eight. Do it.

18:45.719 --> 18:50.620
Come on. Remember me? Old fumble fingers?

18:50.719 --> 18:53.387
Five.

18:53.487 --> 18:54.620
Four. Go!

18:55.987 --> 18:57.921
Three.

18:58.021 --> 18:59.087
Two.

18:59.188 --> 19:02.455
( bomb beeping ) One.

19:02.556 --> 19:04.556
( Terrorsaur screeches )

19:05.789 --> 19:08.256
And now, for you.

19:08.356 --> 19:11.290
Sorry, this cat's gotta scat.

19:18.125 --> 19:19.624
( Terrorsaur screeches )

19:19.724 --> 19:21.025
( grunts )

19:21.125 --> 19:23.125
Ah, slag.

19:35.027 --> 19:37.794
Hiya, cats. Miss me?

19:39.128 --> 19:42.029
( mellow theme playing )

19:42.129 --> 19:44.728
RHINOX: Hey Cheetor, we got your disk.

19:44.828 --> 19:47.362
You saved us from ourselves, son.

19:47.462 --> 19:48.896
Thanks.

19:48.996 --> 19:52.297
Yeah, heh. You may have stepped in it, kid,

19:52.397 --> 19:55.231
but you came out smelling like a rose.

19:55.331 --> 19:58.197
All part of being perfect.

19:59.998 --> 20:01.498
( growls )

20:04.265 --> 20:07.465
Sorry for disobeying your order, big bot.

20:07.566 --> 20:09.733
You don't need to earn my respect, Cheetor.

20:09.832 --> 20:11.099
You've always had it.

20:11.199 --> 20:12.900
And you did end up saving the day.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.367
But be warned: if you ever pull a stunt like that again,

20:16.467 --> 20:18.901
I'll have your tail in a sling.

20:19.001 --> 20:22.869
Okay, okay. I'll never do that again.

20:22.969 --> 20:25.069
Until the next time.

20:25.169 --> 20:27.835
( both chuckle )

20:27.936 --> 20:31.170
( sighs )

20:31.270 --> 20:32.537
( chuckles )

20:32.636 --> 20:34.337
