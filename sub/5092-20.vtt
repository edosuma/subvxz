WEBVTT

00:03.771 --> 00:05.039
ERIN:
The defendant, Uri Denko,

00:05.073 --> 00:08.176
and two associates,
invaded the home

00:08.209 --> 00:10.511
of Boris and Irina Ostrovsky.

00:10.544 --> 00:13.281
Mr. Ostrovsky had refused
to make Mr. Denko

00:13.314 --> 00:16.784
a partner in his
diamond importing business.

00:16.817 --> 00:19.587
Mr. Denko decided
he was going to change

00:19.620 --> 00:24.425
Mr. Ostrovsky's mind--
at gunpoint.

00:24.458 --> 00:28.262
When Mr. Ostrovsky still refused
to cooperate,

00:28.296 --> 00:31.332
the defendant put that gun

00:31.365 --> 00:33.634
to the head of Irina Ostrovsky

00:33.667 --> 00:35.669
and pulled the trigger.

00:35.703 --> 00:40.574
Boris Ostrovsky's beloved wife
died in his arms,

00:40.608 --> 00:44.178
while their two children
slept upstairs.

00:45.513 --> 00:48.282
The people will present
indisputable evidence

00:48.316 --> 00:49.417
of this heinous crime,

00:49.450 --> 00:54.555
including eyewitness testimony
from Boris Ostrovsky.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.526
And then I will ask you
to do your duty...

01:00.294 --> 01:03.731
...convict Uri Denko of murder.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.669
Are the People prepared
to proceed?

01:08.702 --> 01:09.703
ERIN:
We are, Your Honor.

01:09.737 --> 01:12.273
The People call Boris Ostrovsky.

01:20.448 --> 01:23.251
The witness will be sworn in.

01:24.385 --> 01:26.554
Raise your right hand.

01:26.587 --> 01:27.721
Do you solemnly swear or affirm

01:27.755 --> 01:30.224
that the testimony
you are about to give

01:30.258 --> 01:32.360
is the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

01:32.393 --> 01:34.895
(Uri speaking Russian):

01:34.928 --> 01:35.896
(judge banging gavel)

01:35.929 --> 01:36.430
Counselor...

01:36.464 --> 01:38.466
(speaking Russian):

01:38.499 --> 01:39.400
Your Honor...

01:39.433 --> 01:41.269
(Uri continues in Russian):

01:41.302 --> 01:44.238
One more word and you're
in contempt, Mr. Denko.

01:46.940 --> 01:51.379
JUDGE:
Please repeat the oath.

01:51.412 --> 01:52.313
Do you solemnly swear or affirm

01:52.346 --> 01:53.514
that the testimony
you are about to give

01:53.547 --> 01:56.217
is the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

01:59.420 --> 02:01.722
Your Honor, a moment
with the witness.

02:08.662 --> 02:10.731
Boris, it's okay.
All right?

02:10.764 --> 02:12.200
Calm down.

02:12.233 --> 02:14.768
(Russian accent):
This man is an animal.

02:16.437 --> 02:19.173
He threatened my children...

02:19.207 --> 02:21.175
Your children are in Los Angeles
with your brother,

02:21.209 --> 02:22.710
and LAPD has been notified.

02:22.743 --> 02:23.811
They are safe.

02:23.844 --> 02:25.879
You don't know that.

02:30.218 --> 02:32.453
They're all I have left.

02:35.889 --> 02:39.860
Your Honor,
the People request a recess.

02:43.697 --> 02:46.534
A.D.A. Reagan!
A.D.A. Reagan!

02:46.567 --> 02:47.735
A.D.A. Reagan!
Miss Reagan!

02:47.768 --> 02:48.636
FEMALE REPORTER:
A.D.A. Reagan,
are you concerned about

02:48.669 --> 02:50.871
the state of mind
of your eyewitness?

02:50.904 --> 02:51.772
Not at all.

02:51.805 --> 02:52.940
He was clearly shaken

02:52.973 --> 02:54.342
by the defendant's
courtroom outburst.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.977
Mr. Denko's conduct
was outrageous

02:57.010 --> 02:58.746
and he was reprimanded
by the judge.

02:58.779 --> 03:00.414
Mr. Denko has
escaped conviction

03:00.448 --> 03:01.949
on two
previous murder indictments.

03:01.982 --> 03:03.984
Do you really expect
a different result this time?

03:04.017 --> 03:06.887
Mr. Denko is a notorious
organized crime figure

03:06.920 --> 03:09.990
who is responsible
for executing an innocent woman.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.392
I expect justice.

03:11.425 --> 03:12.326
Some have speculated

03:12.360 --> 03:14.462
that your office
rushed this case to trial.

03:14.495 --> 03:15.563
Are you worried that
you don't have enough evidence

03:15.596 --> 03:16.597
for a conviction?

03:16.630 --> 03:18.332
We have truth on our side.

03:18.366 --> 03:19.833
That is all the evidence
we need.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.336
TV REPORTER:
A source from inside the D.A.'s
office says heads will roll

03:22.370 --> 03:23.304
if Denko walks.
Mr. Mayor.

03:23.337 --> 03:24.338
How do you respond?
Frank.

03:24.372 --> 03:25.506
ERIN:
I don't respond to...

03:25.539 --> 03:28.276
That daughter of yours sure
knows how to work the camera.

03:28.309 --> 03:30.778
Taught her everything she knows.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.681
Think she can nail Denko?

03:33.714 --> 03:35.449
Well, the case is sound,

03:35.483 --> 03:37.318
and she's
an excellent prosecutor.

03:37.351 --> 03:40.020
Not much on the agenda.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.522
Our city slept soundly
last night.

03:41.555 --> 03:44.525
Deputy Mayor Glazer is
resigning.

03:44.558 --> 03:45.893
He's taking a job
in Albany.

03:45.926 --> 03:48.362
Well, we're sure gonna miss him.

03:48.396 --> 03:51.365
Listen, I'm the first to admit
Ron could be a little intrusive.

03:51.399 --> 03:53.033
The guy must have sent me
50 memos

03:53.066 --> 03:55.636
on energy-efficient
window treatments at One P.P.

03:55.669 --> 03:58.005
I guess you won't be attending
the farewell party.

03:58.038 --> 03:59.707
Well, I wouldn't want
to get emotional.

03:59.740 --> 04:02.510
We'll have a little party of
our own to mark the occasion.

04:02.543 --> 04:05.379
Look, Frank,
I have a name in mind,

04:05.413 --> 04:07.348
but I wanted
to run it by you first.

04:08.982 --> 04:11.452
You want my opinion
on a political appointment?

04:11.485 --> 04:12.453
Well, as you know,

04:12.486 --> 04:14.655
Deputy Mayor for Operations

04:14.688 --> 04:18.058
is my liaison for all the city's
essential agencies.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.827
I want to make sure
you two

04:19.860 --> 04:21.295
have a good working
relationship.

04:21.329 --> 04:22.496
This someone I know?

04:22.530 --> 04:23.831
Actually...

04:25.466 --> 04:27.801
...you know her quite well.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.977
She's a star, Frank.

04:37.010 --> 04:39.347
She's smart, she's tough.

04:39.380 --> 04:40.681
The D.A. raves about her work.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.616
You must be very proud.

04:42.650 --> 04:44.452
I am.

04:44.485 --> 04:46.019
(chuckles) Listen, I know
what you're thinking--

04:46.053 --> 04:47.755
that this is
a conflict of interest,

04:47.788 --> 04:51.058
but as far as I am concerned,
you're both professionals

04:51.091 --> 04:52.993
working in the best
interests of the city.

04:53.026 --> 04:54.395
Am I right?

04:54.428 --> 04:56.397
Of course.

04:56.430 --> 04:57.631
Good, Frank.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.735
Very good.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.510
Finish your essay?

05:09.543 --> 05:12.713
My conclusion's
still kinda clunky.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.582
You want me to
take a look at it?

05:14.615 --> 05:16.584
Want me to take a look
at your closing argument?

05:16.617 --> 05:19.052
Well, that would be tough since
I haven't written it yet.

05:19.086 --> 05:22.556
Didn't you say you can't
have a good opening argument

05:22.590 --> 05:23.724
until you know
your closing argument?

05:23.757 --> 05:24.825
Well, I know it.

05:24.858 --> 05:25.993
I just haven't written it yet.

05:26.026 --> 05:27.761
Kinda thin, counselor.

05:28.996 --> 05:31.832
I'm certainly glad that
you are not on the jury.

05:31.865 --> 05:34.768
(phone ringing)

05:34.802 --> 05:36.103
Yeah.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.040
I'll be right down.

05:42.042 --> 05:42.876
Everything okay?

05:42.910 --> 05:44.645
No. I gotta go to work.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.749
(sirens wailing)

05:48.782 --> 05:49.817
DANNY: All right, let's get
a canvass going.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.852
I want a three-block canvass
of the neighborhood.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.821
You got it.
Find out what the hell
happened to this guy.

05:53.854 --> 05:54.822
What happened?

05:54.855 --> 05:55.956
What happened?!

05:55.989 --> 05:58.125
Well, Ostrovsky told the
uniforms that were guarding him

05:58.158 --> 05:59.727
that he changed his
mind about testifying.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.429
Said he wanted to go
home and see his kids.

06:01.462 --> 06:02.430
Now look at him.

06:02.463 --> 06:03.997
I calmed him down
after court.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.132
He was okay when I--

06:05.165 --> 06:07.735
Well, apparently,
he wasn't okay, Sis.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.570
He spoke to
his brother in L.A.

06:09.603 --> 06:11.071
The guy was getting
strange phone calls.

06:11.104 --> 06:12.840
Ostrovsky heard
and he took off.

06:12.873 --> 06:13.974
And no one tried
to stop him?

06:14.007 --> 06:15.142
Who's gonna stop him?

06:15.175 --> 06:16.444
He declined police protection.

06:16.477 --> 06:17.911
We have no right to hold him.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.415
Uniforms tried to
follow him, they lost him.

06:21.449 --> 06:23.183
20 minutes later,
he's dead.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.352
Denko's crew was probably
sitting on his place.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.958
Any witnesses?

06:30.991 --> 06:32.793
Still canvassing,
but nothing yet.

06:32.826 --> 06:35.796
Still gonna be able to make your
case without his testimony?

06:35.829 --> 06:38.832
Denko's accomplices
fled the country.

06:38.866 --> 06:40.100
I mean, I've got neighbors

06:40.133 --> 06:42.202
who heard the gunshot,
saw the car;

06:42.235 --> 06:44.037
I've got physical evidence,
but without a witness, I...

06:44.071 --> 06:45.005
DANNY:
Hold on. Look,

06:45.038 --> 06:46.707
we've been working with
the Joint Task Force

06:46.740 --> 06:48.609
for three years,
trying to track Denko down.

06:48.642 --> 06:49.643
This guy's
the biggest gun runner

06:49.677 --> 06:50.644
and shakedown artist
in the city.

06:50.678 --> 06:51.979
We can't let him just walk away.

06:52.012 --> 06:53.547
We got him cold on a homicide!

06:53.581 --> 06:54.381
Yeah, I know!

06:54.414 --> 06:55.649
Well, then you
should know this guy

06:55.683 --> 06:56.917
is the angel of death!
Come on!

06:56.950 --> 06:59.787
This guy practically
laughed in our faces
when we cuffed him,

06:59.820 --> 07:01.555
said we're never gonna
take him down.

07:01.589 --> 07:03.757
Can't let this guy walk away.

07:32.886 --> 07:34.955
ERIN:
I was up all night,
going over the file.

07:34.988 --> 07:37.525
We still have one shot
to nail Denko.

07:37.558 --> 07:38.492
What, uh, shoot him
in his cell?

07:38.526 --> 07:39.827
Sounds good.
ERIN: The nanny.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.061
Sophia Babikov.

07:41.094 --> 07:43.597
The nanny said
she was upstairs with the kids

07:43.631 --> 07:44.798
the night the wife was murdered,

07:44.832 --> 07:46.500
and didn't see anything
or hear anything.

07:46.534 --> 07:47.768
She was scared to death.

07:47.801 --> 07:50.638
Yeah, and I always thought she
knew more than she was saying,

07:50.671 --> 07:52.205
but I had Ostrovsky,
so I figured

07:52.239 --> 07:53.907
why put her
in the middle of everything

07:53.941 --> 07:55.108
if I didn't have to?

07:55.142 --> 07:57.845
Well... now we have to.

08:02.683 --> 08:04.518
Thank you for coming, Sophia.

08:04.552 --> 08:06.754
The police didn't
give me much choice.

08:12.059 --> 08:14.061
They killed Mr. Ostrovsky.

08:14.094 --> 08:16.029
I know.

08:16.063 --> 08:17.765
That's why I needed to see you.

08:17.798 --> 08:21.134
I told you,
I didn't see anything.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.069
Come on, Sophia.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.071
We know that Denko's crew
was in the house

08:24.104 --> 08:25.539
for about 30 minutes.

08:25.573 --> 08:27.975
Even the neighbors heard
screaming and a gunshot.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.910
You want us to believe that
you didn't hear or see anything?

08:31.979 --> 08:35.148
Look, Sophia, um...

08:35.182 --> 08:37.851
what Detective Reagan is trying
to say is, uh,

08:37.885 --> 08:40.988
you know,
maybe you remember something now

08:41.021 --> 08:42.990
that, uh, you didn't before.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.694
ERIN: I know you're
scared, Sophia.

08:46.727 --> 08:49.129
Uri Denko's hurt
a lot of people.

08:49.162 --> 08:50.998
And he's gonna continue
to hurt people,

08:51.031 --> 08:54.602
unless we do something about it.

08:54.635 --> 08:58.839
But in order to do that, I need
you to tell me the truth.

09:08.682 --> 09:12.820
I heard them break through
the back door.

09:14.855 --> 09:17.858
I came downstairs...

09:17.891 --> 09:21.294
just as they shot
Mrs. Ostrovsky.

09:23.897 --> 09:27.367
They put... put
a gun to her head...

09:27.400 --> 09:30.704
and killed her.

09:30.738 --> 09:35.075
So you saw Uri Denko
shoot Mrs. Ostrovsky?

09:38.211 --> 09:40.047
Yes.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.785
The detectives are going to stay
with you, Sophia.

09:44.818 --> 09:46.920
They'll protect you
until you testify.

09:46.954 --> 09:48.889
We're going to keep you safe.

09:50.023 --> 09:52.359
Just like Mr. Ostrovsky?

09:57.698 --> 09:59.633
ERIN:
Deputy Mayor?

09:59.667 --> 10:01.702
Wow.

10:01.735 --> 10:04.171
That's an incredible
opportunity.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.039
Why me?

10:06.073 --> 10:08.208
I'm sure you have
more qualified candidates.

10:08.241 --> 10:11.378
I want a fresh voice.

10:11.411 --> 10:14.648
Someone smart... independent...

10:14.682 --> 10:17.050
who gets things done.

10:17.084 --> 10:19.019
I appreciate
the confidence.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.955
The Deputy Mayor of Operations
is my eyes and ears

10:21.989 --> 10:23.991
in the major agencies: Police,

10:24.024 --> 10:26.159
Fire, Emergency Management--
Sanitation.

10:26.193 --> 10:27.360
I never said it was
all glamorous...

10:27.394 --> 10:28.929
(laughs)

10:28.962 --> 10:30.163
Well, you do know that

10:30.197 --> 10:31.364
I've never worked
in city government.

10:31.398 --> 10:32.666
I've always been
a prosecutor.

10:32.700 --> 10:33.867
That's exactly right.

10:33.901 --> 10:37.938
You take a position, and you
convince a group of strangers

10:37.971 --> 10:39.439
to see things your way.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.842
Yes, but these are not jurors.

10:41.875 --> 10:44.011
They're firemen,
paramedics, cops...

10:44.044 --> 10:46.947
Your family is steeped
in city service.

10:46.980 --> 10:50.851
You speak the language.

10:50.884 --> 10:52.019
And you don't back down.

10:52.052 --> 10:55.022
Would I have input on policy?

10:55.055 --> 10:57.057
You'll be
in all the major meetings.

10:57.090 --> 11:00.160
Working with the most powerful
people in the city.

11:00.193 --> 11:03.163
Erin, you do a good job,

11:03.196 --> 11:05.232
you can write your own ticket.

11:07.901 --> 11:10.437
I assume you've discussed this
with my father?

11:10.470 --> 11:13.173
I have.
And he's very proud of you.

11:15.242 --> 11:17.845
Well, then I have to ask,

11:17.878 --> 11:21.314
by putting a Reagan in this job,

11:21.348 --> 11:23.884
do you hope to
gain leverage with the NYPD?

11:23.917 --> 11:27.454
Would that be so bad?
Actually, yes.

11:27.487 --> 11:30.891
I've never traded on the fact
that Frank Reagan is my father.

11:30.924 --> 11:33.794
I'm not going to start now.

11:33.827 --> 11:36.396
I'm very interested
in this job, sir.

11:36.429 --> 11:39.432
But I need to know this offer
is not based on my last name.

11:39.466 --> 11:42.102
It isn't.

11:42.135 --> 11:44.037
Okay.

11:46.339 --> 11:48.341
Well, as you know,
I just started a trial.

11:48.375 --> 11:53.046
Can I have a few days?
Of course you can.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.822
Sarge?
GORMLEY: Yeah?

12:01.855 --> 12:03.190
Sophia and the witness.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.893
Hello, Sophia.
I'm Sergeant Gormley.

12:05.926 --> 12:07.995
We're gonna take
good care of you.

12:08.028 --> 12:09.296
Detective Torres and his partner

12:09.329 --> 12:10.898
are gonna alternate
12-hour tours

12:10.931 --> 12:12.866
with Detectives Curatola
and Reagan.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.501
Yeah, they're not as
good-looking as us,

12:14.534 --> 12:16.069
but they get the job done.

12:16.103 --> 12:19.139
ATF Agent Schilling is gonna
coordinate logistics.

12:19.172 --> 12:22.876
I am worried about
my family in Russia.

12:22.910 --> 12:25.312
When this man finds out
I'm testifying...

12:25.345 --> 12:28.315
ATF has reached out to the
embassy and Russian authorities.

12:28.348 --> 12:29.516
Your family will be protected.

12:31.118 --> 12:32.385
You're doing the right thing.

12:32.419 --> 12:36.223
Yeah, we're going to
take good care of you.

12:38.225 --> 12:39.392
I take it you need me.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.294
Thought you might
like some good news.

12:42.362 --> 12:43.997
Glazer's history.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.835
I know that.
Oh.

12:47.868 --> 12:50.237
Well, next time you talk
to the Mayor,

12:50.270 --> 12:53.140
thank him for removing that
particular pain in my ass.

12:53.173 --> 12:56.209
Yeah, well, at least
Glazer was controllable,

12:56.243 --> 12:57.911
the mayor's
replacement won't be.

12:57.945 --> 12:59.847
He's picked
a replacement already?

12:59.880 --> 13:01.514
Oh, yeah.

13:02.515 --> 13:04.351
Erin.

13:04.384 --> 13:05.986
(chuckles)

13:06.019 --> 13:07.821
Seriously?
Yeah.

13:07.855 --> 13:08.922
Oh.

13:08.956 --> 13:10.457
Jim Erin's a pushover.

13:10.490 --> 13:13.126
No-- Erin.

13:15.863 --> 13:16.930
Your Erin?

13:16.964 --> 13:18.365
Yeah.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.301
Oh, boy.

13:21.334 --> 13:24.404
Well, she'd be twice
the DMO Glazer was.

13:24.437 --> 13:25.605
Yeah, so would a houseplant.

13:25.638 --> 13:26.573
I didn't mean that Erin was--

13:26.606 --> 13:29.910
I know what you meant.
You know I love Erin.

13:29.943 --> 13:31.078
But not for this.

13:31.111 --> 13:34.447
The DMO is by definition an
adversary of this office.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.984
Yeah, he'd be paying her
to go up against me.

13:37.017 --> 13:39.119
What do you think
he's up to?

13:39.152 --> 13:41.354
I'm not sure, I don't know
whether he's declaring war

13:41.388 --> 13:43.390
or trying to make peace,
but either way the guy

13:43.423 --> 13:45.525
doesn't brush his teeth
without an agenda.

13:45.558 --> 13:48.361
But never one that hits
this close to home.

13:48.395 --> 13:50.197
(sighing heavily):
Yeah.

13:50.230 --> 13:51.431
My home.

13:51.464 --> 13:53.433
What are you going
to do to stop it?

13:53.466 --> 13:54.534
(sighs)

13:54.567 --> 13:57.905
I don't know.

14:05.312 --> 14:07.347
I didn't say
it was your fault,

14:07.380 --> 14:09.449
but the AC's pumping out heat
and it won't stop.

14:09.482 --> 14:11.885
It's like a coming attraction
for hell up here.

14:11.919 --> 14:13.486
Okay, thank you.

14:13.520 --> 14:14.521
(hangs up)

14:16.489 --> 14:18.959
AC's on the fritz;
repairman's on his way up.

14:18.992 --> 14:21.628
Well, least it saves me
a trip to the gym.

14:21.661 --> 14:24.031
Tell me about it.
She fall asleep?

14:24.064 --> 14:25.265
Yeah.

14:25.298 --> 14:27.267
Oh, really now?

14:27.300 --> 14:29.102
What's that,
your boyfriend again?

14:29.136 --> 14:31.304
Yeah. Paul.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.006
Oh, sorry. Paul.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.308
Now he's saying
he doesn't even think

14:35.342 --> 14:36.944
I wanted to go to
Atlantic City this weekend.

14:36.977 --> 14:39.046
He does realize that
you have to work, right?

14:39.079 --> 14:41.314
Uh, yeah, he obviously
does not care.

14:41.348 --> 14:44.417
Hm, well, he sounds
like a real keeper.
(groans)

14:44.451 --> 14:46.453
He is.
Hm.

14:46.486 --> 14:49.289
He is.
Mm-hmm.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.158
Maybe, I don't know.
Yeah, maybe.

14:51.191 --> 14:53.560
No, he just,
he does not get the job.

14:53.593 --> 14:57.965
You want, I should, you know,
go have a talk with him?

14:57.998 --> 15:00.533
Oh, yes, Dr. Phil, please.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.269
Go have a talk with him.

15:02.302 --> 15:04.171
Because the last guy,
Derek the Dentist,
Hm.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.073
you had a talk with him
and he fled the state.

15:06.106 --> 15:08.075
Yeah, well, Derek
the Dentist was a shmuck

15:08.108 --> 15:09.276
and he wasn't
good enough for you.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.111
Well, Paul
is good enough for me.

15:11.144 --> 15:13.046
He just, he's just pissed
that I have to

15:13.080 --> 15:15.048
spend the weekend with you
instead of him.

15:15.082 --> 15:17.084
Well...
Tell him there's nothing
to be jealous about.

15:17.117 --> 15:18.351
(knocking on door)

15:22.422 --> 15:23.390
MAN:
Maintenance.

15:23.423 --> 15:24.992
Hey.

15:28.595 --> 15:31.031
Slide your I.D. under
the door please, sir.

15:41.374 --> 15:43.676
Police, turn around.
I'm just here to fix the heat.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.512
I have to search you, sir.
Turn around.

15:53.686 --> 15:55.488
All right, hold that.

15:55.522 --> 15:57.490
I got it.

15:59.692 --> 16:00.960
He's clean, Jack.

16:00.994 --> 16:03.430
Come in and get that air
conditioner fixed
quick, all right?

16:03.463 --> 16:07.334
All right. It'll just
take me a minute.
I got it.

16:10.703 --> 16:12.439
It's too hot to sleep.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.241
Okay, uh, well,
we're fixing it now.

16:14.274 --> 16:15.308
Stay back here.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.612
You electric workers' union?

16:19.646 --> 16:22.149
Uh, yeah, about three years.

16:22.182 --> 16:23.316
Mm-hmm.

16:23.350 --> 16:25.418
I got a cousin in Local Three.

16:25.452 --> 16:27.154
They take good care
of you guys, don't they?

16:27.187 --> 16:29.356
Oh, yeah.

16:29.389 --> 16:33.060
Trouble is that's a welder's
union patch on your shirt.

16:33.093 --> 16:34.327
Get your hands off the gun!

16:34.361 --> 16:35.562
Drop it!

16:35.595 --> 16:37.030
Get down here or I'll
air-condition your head.

16:37.064 --> 16:38.498
Spread 'em!

16:38.531 --> 16:40.033
Jackie!

16:40.067 --> 16:41.034
Yeah.

16:41.068 --> 16:42.335
We gotta move-- now!

16:42.369 --> 16:44.237
Get her outta here.

16:48.675 --> 16:51.178
All right, move.

16:51.211 --> 16:52.579
(panting)

16:52.612 --> 16:54.681
You said I'd be safe.
Where are you taking me?

16:54.714 --> 16:56.183
Relax, Sophia,
you're gonna be okay.

16:56.216 --> 16:57.317
Stay right there.

17:01.354 --> 17:02.455
All right, move.

17:02.489 --> 17:04.124
Come on.

17:05.192 --> 17:07.627
Come on.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.629
What do you think?
We gotta call this in,
get a new location.

17:09.662 --> 17:11.631
We can't do it.
We gotta go off the grid.

17:11.664 --> 17:12.765
Stay.

17:16.369 --> 17:17.604
All right, come on.

17:17.637 --> 17:19.439
Go.

17:19.472 --> 17:22.109
DANNY:
Right here.

17:22.142 --> 17:23.476
What are you thinking?

17:23.510 --> 17:25.612
The only people who knew
we were gonna be in that room

17:25.645 --> 17:27.514
with Sophia are the people
on the task force,

17:27.547 --> 17:29.649
and somebody planted that gun
before we got there.

17:29.682 --> 17:31.084
Think we got a leak?

17:31.118 --> 17:32.419
It's the only explanation.

17:32.452 --> 17:33.653
Look, your place
is close by, right?

17:33.686 --> 17:35.322
Can we take her there?
Yeah.

17:35.355 --> 17:37.124
(door opening)

17:46.633 --> 17:48.101
Hey.
Hi.

17:48.135 --> 17:49.336
Dinner?

17:49.369 --> 17:50.370
Yeah.

17:51.571 --> 17:55.675
I have pork chops
and asparagus,

17:55.708 --> 17:58.178
and Linda is doing
the potatoes.

17:58.211 --> 17:59.446
You look nice.

17:59.479 --> 18:03.250
Thanks. Ostrovsky's funeral
is in a half hour,

18:03.283 --> 18:05.152
so... just thought
I should attend.

18:05.185 --> 18:06.786
Good for you.

18:06.819 --> 18:09.322
Where are you off to?

18:09.356 --> 18:11.324
Oh, I got a speech
at the academy.

18:16.163 --> 18:19.699
You think we should talk about
this deputy mayor thing?

18:19.732 --> 18:21.134
Yeah.

18:21.168 --> 18:22.735
It sure came out of left field.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.404
Yeah.

18:26.639 --> 18:27.707
Maybe after dinner.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.209
That'd be good.

18:30.477 --> 18:32.179
Okay, it's a date.

18:32.212 --> 18:33.480
Works for me.

18:33.513 --> 18:34.781
(sighing):
Oh, I forgot the applesauce.

18:34.814 --> 18:36.383
I'll pick it up on the way back.

18:36.416 --> 18:37.684
Anyway, thank you.

18:37.717 --> 18:38.851
See you at dinner.

18:38.885 --> 18:40.753
Yeah, knock 'em dead.

18:45.292 --> 18:48.361
All right, so how do you want
to play this, Sarge?

18:50.630 --> 18:52.565
I alerted
the Chief of D's directly.

18:52.599 --> 18:55.702
No one on the task force knows
what went down.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.270
Except the son of a bitch
tipping off Denko.

18:57.304 --> 18:58.505
Exactly.

18:58.538 --> 18:59.539
I got personnel files

18:59.572 --> 19:00.773
on the whole team.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.475
All these guys got
time on the job.

19:02.509 --> 19:04.377
It won't be easy
to I.D. the leak.

19:04.411 --> 19:05.645
All right,

19:05.678 --> 19:07.780
Jack's gonna sit on the witness.
I'm gonna head into the squad.

19:07.814 --> 19:08.915
All right.

19:08.948 --> 19:11.918
Okay, everything looks secure.

19:11.951 --> 19:14.421
And it's a very nice place,
by the way.

19:14.454 --> 19:16.623
Yeah, where'd you think,
I lived in a cave?

19:16.656 --> 19:19.759
No, I just didn't expect it
to be so girly.

19:19.792 --> 19:21.328
Well, I am a girl, Reagan.

19:21.361 --> 19:22.729
I know.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.264
Ooh. Hello.

19:24.297 --> 19:25.332
Yeah, it's me

19:25.365 --> 19:27.267
and my cousin Andrea
in Boca.

19:27.300 --> 19:28.901
Mm! Well, that confirms
the girly part.

19:28.935 --> 19:30.937
All right, I'm gonna
head to the squad.

19:30.970 --> 19:32.539
If you so much as hear a peep,

19:32.572 --> 19:33.906
put it over the air,
all right?

19:33.940 --> 19:36.543
And do not open that door
for a soul.

19:36.576 --> 19:37.810
No.

19:46.653 --> 19:48.355
Here you go.

19:52.392 --> 19:53.893
(sighing)

19:53.926 --> 19:55.328
Wow.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.297
You're very good.

19:59.666 --> 20:03.570
They're the woods
behind my mother's house.

20:03.603 --> 20:04.904
When I was a little girl,

20:04.937 --> 20:07.374
I named all these trees.

20:07.407 --> 20:09.342
So you think you'll
go back there after all this?

20:09.376 --> 20:10.743
Maybe.

20:10.777 --> 20:13.280
If I'm still alive.

20:14.381 --> 20:17.384
You'll still be alive.

20:19.886 --> 20:22.255
Eight people on the task force
had advance knowledge

20:22.289 --> 20:23.790
of Sophia's location, right?

20:23.823 --> 20:26.393
Out of our guys, I'm gonna give
me, you, and Jackie a pass.

20:26.426 --> 20:28.328
Thanks for the vote
of confidence.

20:28.361 --> 20:30.463
Okay, that leaves Torres
out of our guys.

20:30.497 --> 20:32.699
According to his file, he worked
for O-CID for three years,

20:32.732 --> 20:33.833
including the Russian Mob.

20:33.866 --> 20:36.002
Maybe they got
their hooks in him.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.837
Guy's a decorated cop.
It ain't him.

20:37.870 --> 20:39.272
So was Tommy Delacorte.

20:39.306 --> 20:41.874
Now he's doing a dime
for a RICO case, Sarge.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.610
I don't know.

20:43.643 --> 20:44.877
All right, well, what do you got
on the four ATF guys?

20:44.911 --> 20:47.414
We have Brookner, Schilling,

20:47.447 --> 20:49.516
Moncrieff and Isherman.

20:49.549 --> 20:50.917
They're all clean.

20:50.950 --> 20:53.019
They're sending OPR
to help us out.

20:53.052 --> 20:54.354
Great.

20:54.387 --> 20:56.623
One of ours selling out.
Makes me sick.

20:56.656 --> 20:57.624
We'll get 'em.

20:57.657 --> 20:58.791
(knock at door)

21:02.028 --> 21:04.897
Sophia's okay.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.466
What the hell is going on?

21:06.499 --> 21:08.435
We're pretty sure
Denko's got an informant

21:08.468 --> 21:09.836
inside the task force.

21:09.869 --> 21:11.938
Oh, well, that's just great.
Who the hell is it?

21:11.971 --> 21:13.039
We don't know yet.

21:13.072 --> 21:15.041
Where's Sophia?

21:15.074 --> 21:16.909
She's fine.
She's stashed away with Jackie.

21:16.943 --> 21:19.646
I've already lost one eyewitness
in this case.

21:19.679 --> 21:21.681
I do not intend
to lose another one.

21:21.714 --> 21:23.383
Right.

21:23.416 --> 21:26.453
We need to get ESU in
for tactical support.

21:26.486 --> 21:28.421
Whoa.
The situation's
under control, counselor.

21:28.455 --> 21:29.889
Really? You could've fooled me.

21:29.922 --> 21:30.990
DANNY:
Look, come on.

21:31.023 --> 21:32.659
Bringing in more badges
just creates

21:32.692 --> 21:35.628
more opportunity for Denko
to get inside information.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.364
You gotta trust me on this one.

21:37.397 --> 21:38.765
This poor girl is scared
to death.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.099
I know.
She trusted me.

21:40.132 --> 21:42.001
I put her life in your hands.

21:42.034 --> 21:43.336
I know.

21:45.505 --> 21:47.674
You better keep her alive.

21:47.707 --> 21:49.442
(slamming door)

21:51.110 --> 21:53.946
Guess you avoided
pissing her off growing up, huh?

21:53.980 --> 21:55.081
Yeah.

21:55.114 --> 21:56.849
The problem is she's right.

22:00.587 --> 22:02.555
How'd the lecture go?

22:02.589 --> 22:03.823
Tough to tell.

22:03.856 --> 22:06.426
Even when I stink,
they give me a standing O.

22:06.459 --> 22:07.827
It's good to be the king.

22:07.860 --> 22:09.829
So, let's hear it.

22:09.862 --> 22:11.330
What?

22:13.433 --> 22:15.334
We been working together
too long.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.904
John Damiano.

22:17.937 --> 22:19.839
City Commissioner over at
Environmental Protection.

22:19.872 --> 22:21.741
I've met him. Good man.

22:21.774 --> 22:22.875
Why am I holding his resume?

22:22.909 --> 22:27.514
Damiano is the consensus choice
of the agencies for DMO.

22:27.547 --> 22:30.650
They like him,
and he knows the turf.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.552
If they move forward,

22:32.585 --> 22:34.487
our little problem goes away.

22:34.521 --> 22:37.023
Poole drops Erin in order
to preserve his relationship

22:37.056 --> 22:38.691
with the chiefs.

22:38.725 --> 22:40.860
And my name
never gets mentioned?

22:40.893 --> 22:42.128
That's right.

22:42.161 --> 22:43.896
Pretty elegant solution.

22:47.967 --> 22:49.769
The chiefs can do
whatever they think's right.

22:49.802 --> 22:50.970
(sighing)

22:51.003 --> 22:53.473
I have no idea
what the mayor's up to,

22:53.506 --> 22:55.442
but if he wants Erin,
he's gonna get her.

22:56.843 --> 22:59.045
She's my kid.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.582
You're a good dad.

23:02.615 --> 23:04.784
Don't remind me.

23:07.053 --> 23:08.821
(sighing)

23:08.855 --> 23:11.157
Yeah, I understand.

23:11.190 --> 23:13.693
Thanks for your time,
Captain.

23:13.726 --> 23:15.495
Torres checks out clean.

23:15.528 --> 23:17.630
They all do.
I know.

23:17.664 --> 23:18.898
There's only one way
we're gonna find this leak.

23:18.931 --> 23:19.932
What, you wanna
put them in a room?

23:19.966 --> 23:21.133
We got no choice.

23:21.167 --> 23:22.535
Come on, Sarge, they're cops.

23:22.569 --> 23:24.737
They're not gonna fold
under questioning.

23:24.771 --> 23:27.474
Okay, we can call Denko's crew,
ask them which one of our guys

23:27.507 --> 23:29.108
is playing
for their team.

23:29.141 --> 23:31.744
You may be on to
something there.

23:31.778 --> 23:33.813
What are you talking about?

23:33.846 --> 23:35.848
Two birds, one stone.

23:39.952 --> 23:41.521
Sophia, food is here.

23:41.554 --> 23:44.624
Uh, can't say much
about the borscht,

23:44.657 --> 23:47.426
but the, uh,
pierogies smell good.

23:48.695 --> 23:50.062
Hey, are you okay?

23:50.096 --> 23:52.231
Did you speak to your aunt?

23:52.264 --> 23:56.603
The police had to move my mother
from her village in Russia.

23:57.970 --> 24:00.172
Denko's guys were
looking for her.

24:00.206 --> 24:01.541
I have to go home.

24:01.574 --> 24:02.909
Sophia, you can't do that.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.043
Yes, I can.

24:04.076 --> 24:06.513
I know the law.
I'm not under arrest.

24:06.546 --> 24:08.114
The subpoena says only

24:08.147 --> 24:10.249
that I must
be in court Monday.

24:10.282 --> 24:12.819
Yes, but you can't testify
from another continent.

24:12.852 --> 24:14.721
I'm sorry. I have to go.

24:14.754 --> 24:15.988
Whoa, okay. Wait, whoa-whoa.

24:16.022 --> 24:17.223
S-S-Sophia, listen to me.

24:17.256 --> 24:19.759
Denko pulled the same stuff
on Ostrovsky.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.928
He threatened his children,
and the man was so scared

24:21.961 --> 24:24.664
he came out of hiding, and when
he did, they killed him.

24:24.697 --> 24:27.900
So I should let this man
kill my mother?!

24:27.934 --> 24:29.636
The authorities will
protect her.

24:29.669 --> 24:31.203
You don't know that.

24:31.237 --> 24:32.772
What I do know is if you leave,

24:32.805 --> 24:34.874
they will kill you
before you get to the airport.

24:34.907 --> 24:36.275
I should never have agreed
to testify.

24:36.308 --> 24:38.645
My aunt told me
not to get involved.

24:38.678 --> 24:39.846
But you got involved!

24:39.879 --> 24:42.982
You got involved because you are
strong and you are brave,

24:43.015 --> 24:44.651
and you are tired of running

24:44.684 --> 24:46.819
from men like Denko.

24:48.788 --> 24:52.725
The only way scum like that wins
is if you leave.

24:55.194 --> 24:57.029
I'll help you.

24:58.030 --> 24:59.566
(sobbing)

24:59.599 --> 25:00.733
I know.

25:01.901 --> 25:03.536
It's okay.

25:05.171 --> 25:06.172
I know.

25:16.916 --> 25:20.119
Mmm, these potatoes
are amazing.

25:20.152 --> 25:22.054
Yeah, I threw in a little cream
and gorgonzola.

25:22.088 --> 25:25.324
So much for
a heart-healthy Sunday dinner.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.727
(quietly):
I made a plain batch for Henry.

25:27.760 --> 25:30.797
Oh, yeah? Good luck with that.

25:30.830 --> 25:34.200
So where are you
on the mayor's job offer?

25:34.233 --> 25:36.603
Still reeling.

25:36.636 --> 25:38.671
It sounds like
an amazing opportunity.

25:38.705 --> 25:40.807
It is.

25:40.840 --> 25:42.809
It's a game changer
for me and Dad.

25:42.842 --> 25:44.877
He's gonna support you,

25:44.911 --> 25:46.779
like he always does.

25:46.813 --> 25:48.347
I don't know about that.

25:48.380 --> 25:51.851
It's a whole new territory
for the both of us.

25:51.884 --> 25:54.887
If I'm putting bad guys away,

25:54.921 --> 25:57.724
then I'm still
in the family business.

25:57.757 --> 25:58.991
This job...

25:59.025 --> 26:02.595
I'd be responsible in areas that
are in direct conflict with his.

26:02.629 --> 26:05.732
Yeah, well, you can't let that
dictate, though, right?

26:05.765 --> 26:09.001
Well, I can't ignore it, either.

26:12.905 --> 26:14.173
Hey.

26:15.007 --> 26:16.175
Feel better, sunshine?

26:16.208 --> 26:19.946
Yeah, thanks. I didn't have
time to go home and shower.

26:19.979 --> 26:21.781
Your toilet seat,
is that heated?

26:21.814 --> 26:23.082
Nice, right?

26:23.115 --> 26:25.351
I gotta get the commissioner one
for Christmas.

26:25.384 --> 26:27.186
Look, this shirt,
it's really ripe.

26:27.219 --> 26:29.155
Do you, uh,
got a washing machine?

26:29.188 --> 26:30.322
Yeah, I, uh,

26:30.356 --> 26:32.625
follow me.

26:35.094 --> 26:38.130
Um, uh...

26:38.164 --> 26:41.100
I, uh, think, uh...

26:41.133 --> 26:44.136
you and Paul are
around the same size.

26:44.170 --> 26:46.005
Well, in t-shirts, maybe.

26:46.038 --> 26:48.708
(groaning)

26:48.741 --> 26:50.342
That's pretty soft.
It's not Fruit of the Loom.

26:50.376 --> 26:51.944
No.

26:51.978 --> 26:54.280
He's a bit of a clothes horse.

26:54.313 --> 26:55.782
Must be a Wall Street guy.

26:55.815 --> 26:57.283
(chuckling)
Mm-hmm.

26:57.316 --> 27:00.186
And he gets to keep
his clothes here, huh?

27:00.219 --> 27:01.754
Hmm!

27:01.788 --> 27:03.723
A few nights a week, yeah.

27:03.756 --> 27:05.858
Well, he's a lucky man.

27:05.892 --> 27:08.828
Thank you, Danny.

27:08.861 --> 27:10.797
I mean, 'cause he gets to use
the heated toilet seat.

27:10.830 --> 27:12.732
Right.

27:12.765 --> 27:14.366
(phone ringing)
Hey, Sarge.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.368
You guys okay over there?

27:16.402 --> 27:18.337
Yeah, we're good.
You ready to give it a try?

27:18.370 --> 27:20.139
Good to go.

27:22.241 --> 27:23.910
Okay, listen up.

27:23.943 --> 27:25.912
I got Sophia Babikov's
new location.

27:25.945 --> 27:27.379
Let's get to work.

27:44.731 --> 27:45.865
RUSSIAN MAN:
Da.

27:45.898 --> 27:47.166
It's Schilling.

27:47.199 --> 27:49.001
I know where
they're keeping the girl.

27:56.508 --> 27:59.211
First, the Giants
win the Super Bowl,

27:59.245 --> 28:00.980
and now
my own granddaughter's

28:01.013 --> 28:02.949
gonna become
a crooked politician.

28:02.982 --> 28:05.384
Politicians run for office,
Grandpa.

28:05.417 --> 28:07.486
The deputy mayor is appointed.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.822
Yeah, Erin's gonna be
a corrupt city official.

28:09.856 --> 28:11.423
Thank you for that.

28:11.457 --> 28:13.225
HENRY:
Well, no matter how you put it,

28:13.259 --> 28:14.293
it's a dirty business.

28:14.326 --> 28:16.362
Jack's running
for class president.

28:16.395 --> 28:19.031
But that's a totally different
thing, right, Pop?

28:19.065 --> 28:19.999
If you say so.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.500
No, no, no.

28:21.533 --> 28:22.969
It's completely different.

28:23.002 --> 28:25.104
Yeah. Is Dad coming?

28:25.137 --> 28:28.107
Hmm, he can't, sweetie.
He's working.

28:28.140 --> 28:30.242
What do you think about Erin
working for the mayor, Dad?

28:30.276 --> 28:31.744
Well,

28:31.778 --> 28:32.979
the mayor's a smart guy.

28:33.012 --> 28:34.180
I just wish I knew
what he was up to.

28:34.213 --> 28:36.415
Pass the potatoes, please.

28:36.448 --> 28:38.450
ERIN:
What is that supposed to mean?

28:39.551 --> 28:41.320
It means the potatoes
are delicious

28:41.353 --> 28:42.755
and I'd like some more.

28:42.789 --> 28:44.323
ERIN: No, what the
mayor is "up to,"

28:44.356 --> 28:48.861
as if he's only offered me the
job because I'm your daughter.

28:48.895 --> 28:50.062
I didn't say that.

28:50.096 --> 28:51.764
He didn't say that.

28:51.798 --> 28:54.466
I think it's a smart move,
having an attorney in that job.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.002
Yeah, and I think
Erin would make

28:56.035 --> 28:57.870
an outstanding deputy mayor.

28:57.904 --> 28:59.438
Thank you.
Yeah, one that
happens to have

28:59.471 --> 29:03.175
an inside track with
the police commissioner, right?

29:04.410 --> 29:05.778
Do you work
for the mayor, Grandpa?

29:07.579 --> 29:08.981
Yes, I do, Jack.

29:09.015 --> 29:11.050
So if Aunt Erin
becomes deputy mayor,

29:11.083 --> 29:12.318
will she be your boss?

29:12.351 --> 29:13.886
LINDA:
No, not exactly.

29:13.920 --> 29:15.454
They'll just be
working together.

29:15.487 --> 29:17.023
Okay.
Although Erin will

29:17.056 --> 29:18.290
be able to get Grandpa
in big trouble

29:18.324 --> 29:20.326
if he steps out of line.

29:22.061 --> 29:23.996
Oh, your, um, your witness

29:24.030 --> 29:26.032
testifies tomorrow
in the Denko case.

29:26.065 --> 29:27.566
Should put you
over the top, yeah?

29:27.599 --> 29:32.104
Yeah, if the task force can keep
her alive for the next 12 hours.

29:32.138 --> 29:34.173
Denko's no ordinary
defendant.

29:34.206 --> 29:36.075
Yeah, not with an informant

29:36.108 --> 29:38.177
that's giving him
confidential information.

29:38.210 --> 29:40.579
Protecting witnesses
is not an exact science.

29:40.612 --> 29:43.049
Oh, and one that I couldn't
possibly understand

29:43.082 --> 29:44.350
because I'm not a cop?

29:44.383 --> 29:45.351
I didn't say that.

29:45.384 --> 29:46.585
He didn't say that.

29:46.618 --> 29:47.453
He didn't say that.

29:47.486 --> 29:49.121
Exc...
But honestly?

29:49.155 --> 29:52.058
No, you can't.

29:54.961 --> 29:59.331
Sounds to me like it's an easy
way to defend incompetence.

29:59.365 --> 30:01.901
Those people are putting
their lives on the line

30:01.934 --> 30:04.436
to protect your witness.

30:04.470 --> 30:06.939
I shouldn't have to sit there
and defend them.

30:10.042 --> 30:11.944
These potatoes are great, Linda.
You do something different?

30:13.512 --> 30:16.916
Taste the same to me.

30:23.655 --> 30:27.093
You know, um...

30:27.126 --> 30:30.562
you should probably
get some sleep.

30:30.596 --> 30:32.631
You have a big day tomorrow.

30:32.664 --> 30:35.334
(sighs)

30:35.367 --> 30:37.103
What do you think?

30:38.670 --> 30:41.240
It's beautiful.

30:41.273 --> 30:44.010
They're the mountains
near my village.

30:47.246 --> 30:50.516
It's for you.

30:54.020 --> 30:54.987
(sighs)

30:55.021 --> 30:55.922
It's very beautiful.

30:55.955 --> 30:56.923
Thank you.

30:56.956 --> 30:58.624
Thank you.

31:00.326 --> 31:03.262
Thank you for keeping me safe.

31:05.264 --> 31:07.900
You're welcome.

31:31.323 --> 31:33.325
*

32:03.355 --> 32:05.357
*

32:08.460 --> 32:10.529
I wish it was morning.

32:10.562 --> 32:12.131
Close your eyes.

32:12.164 --> 32:14.200
It'll be over soon.

32:19.505 --> 32:21.140
Police! Drop it!

32:25.244 --> 32:26.378
Drop it!

32:26.412 --> 32:28.180
(officers shouting)

32:28.214 --> 32:30.649
Hands where I can
see 'em-- up!

32:32.351 --> 32:35.321
Well, looks like
you got the wrong address.

32:45.097 --> 32:46.498
Come on.

32:46.532 --> 32:47.966
Leave the cuffs on.

33:00.146 --> 33:02.648
I guess it's true
what they say, huh?

33:02.681 --> 33:05.717
When the ship sinks,
the rats run for the exit.

33:05.751 --> 33:07.553
Just heading out
for a pack of smokes.

33:07.586 --> 33:08.687
Come on, Schilling, save it.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.489
The new address
you gave Denko's crew

33:10.522 --> 33:12.524
was a setup,
and you took the bait.

33:12.558 --> 33:15.261
His guy gave you up before
I even read him his rights.

33:15.294 --> 33:17.363
So you gonna arrest me?

33:17.396 --> 33:18.730
I don't know.

33:18.764 --> 33:20.166
That's up to you.

33:20.199 --> 33:21.300
I get it.

33:21.333 --> 33:24.336
You want me to run, so you can
put a bullet in my back.

33:24.370 --> 33:27.506
I wouldn't waste a bullet
on a scumbag like you.

33:27.539 --> 33:29.641
You walk out that door,
I won't have to.

33:29.675 --> 33:31.577
That bad tip you gave

33:31.610 --> 33:32.711
got one of Denko's boys killed,

33:32.744 --> 33:35.047
so the minute you hit
the street, you're a dead man.

33:35.081 --> 33:37.683
Go ahead.

33:37.716 --> 33:40.052
I'm not stopping you.

33:56.602 --> 33:58.437
Heads up.
We're on the move.

33:58.470 --> 33:59.838
You ready to
go, young lady?

33:59.871 --> 34:00.639
Yes.

34:00.672 --> 34:02.408
Actually, uh, just
one thing first.

34:02.441 --> 34:04.310
Yeah, we're ready
on this end.

34:04.343 --> 34:05.311
Okay.

34:05.344 --> 34:07.346
Someone wants
to talk to you.

34:10.882 --> 34:14.186
Hello.

34:14.220 --> 34:16.088
(laughs):
Mama!

34:16.122 --> 34:20.259
Figured she could use
the moral support.

34:29.368 --> 34:30.336
(sighs)

34:30.369 --> 34:33.172
So much beauty

34:33.205 --> 34:35.207
wasted in a courtroom.

34:35.241 --> 34:39.745
Can't wait to put you
in the cage where you belong.

34:39.778 --> 34:42.181
You need a witness to do this.

34:42.214 --> 34:44.450
Well, she's on her way.

34:44.483 --> 34:47.619
I hope she makes it.

34:47.653 --> 34:50.289
Morning traffic's a bitch.

34:58.564 --> 35:00.699
Heading to the car now.

35:00.732 --> 35:03.769
Estimating arriving at
the courthouse in 19 minutes.

35:03.802 --> 35:05.404
Roger that.

35:08.240 --> 35:10.242
All right, let's go.

35:12.511 --> 35:13.545
Not home yet.

35:13.579 --> 35:14.780
Keep your eyes open.

35:20.652 --> 35:22.754
You okay?

35:22.788 --> 35:24.423
Yes.

35:28.627 --> 35:32.264
My mother said
she's proud of me.

35:32.298 --> 35:33.599
She should be.

35:38.704 --> 35:40.339
What the hell
was that?!

35:43.375 --> 35:44.743
We got company!
Jack, get down!

35:44.776 --> 35:46.412
(gunfire)

35:51.917 --> 35:53.619
(tires screeching)
Danny, what the hell
are you doing?!

36:02.528 --> 36:04.763
Son of a bitch.

36:04.796 --> 36:06.498
That's what the hell I'm doing.

36:06.532 --> 36:08.200
Works for me.

36:15.641 --> 36:17.809
Secure that door!

36:17.843 --> 36:19.845
(tires screech)

36:25.884 --> 36:27.853
Glad you made it.
You ready?

36:30.556 --> 36:31.757
MAN:
Come on inside! Come on!

36:36.728 --> 36:37.963
You'll be okay.

36:37.996 --> 36:40.699
Heard you had some excitement
on the way in.

36:40.732 --> 36:41.933
Yeah, well,
nothing we couldn't handle.

36:41.967 --> 36:43.569
Look, I've been tough on you.

36:43.602 --> 36:45.471
I just wanted to say thank you.

36:45.504 --> 36:46.838
You'll get our bill.

36:48.907 --> 36:51.277
Take care of her.

36:51.310 --> 36:53.812
You know, if we hurry, I can
drive you down to Atlantic City.

36:53.845 --> 36:55.381
You can still
get there in time

36:55.414 --> 36:56.748
to hang out with
Mr. Wall Street.

36:56.782 --> 36:58.617
No.

36:58.650 --> 37:00.586
I'll settle
for breakfast, though.

37:00.619 --> 37:01.620
Breakfast?
Yes.

37:01.653 --> 37:02.754
Sounds good.

37:02.788 --> 37:04.890
You know, you cannot
keep that T-shirt.

37:04.923 --> 37:07.393
What T-shirt?

37:09.295 --> 37:11.997
Ms. Reagan, are the People
prepared to proceed?

37:12.030 --> 37:13.031
We are, Your Honor.

37:13.064 --> 37:14.966
The People call Sophia Babikov.

37:24.810 --> 37:26.712
Raise your right hand.

37:27.813 --> 37:28.914
Do you solemnly
swear or affirm

37:28.947 --> 37:29.981
that the testimony

37:30.015 --> 37:32.351
you are about to give
is the truth, the whole truth

37:32.384 --> 37:33.552
and nothing
but the truth?

37:35.587 --> 37:36.888
Your Honor!
Be quiet, Mr. Denko.

37:39.057 --> 37:41.493
(gallery murmuring)

37:46.365 --> 37:47.999
Ms. Babikov?

37:56.675 --> 37:58.410
I do.

37:58.444 --> 38:01.046
(gallery murmuring)

38:18.029 --> 38:19.631
That for me?

38:29.641 --> 38:31.443
Thanks for coming.

38:31.477 --> 38:33.679
Thanks for asking.

38:33.712 --> 38:37.383
Remember when we used to come
down here when I was little,

38:37.416 --> 38:39.585
keep a lookout
for pirate ships?

38:39.618 --> 38:41.052
You with that plastic sword,

38:41.086 --> 38:44.990
talking a mile a minute about
how that's what you wanted to be

38:45.023 --> 38:46.558
when you grew up.

38:46.592 --> 38:49.528
That's right.

38:52.964 --> 38:55.734
I didn't mean to

38:55.767 --> 38:57.869
insult the department.

38:57.903 --> 38:59.471
It was out of line.

38:59.505 --> 39:02.073
I never thought for a second

39:02.107 --> 39:05.677
you weren't up to
being deputy mayor.

39:05.711 --> 39:09.080
I know it's been
awkward for you.

39:09.114 --> 39:11.483
Eh, it's tough when you get
caught between your job

39:11.517 --> 39:14.152
and the ambitions
of your kids.

39:14.185 --> 39:17.489
But I would never
stand in your way.

39:17.523 --> 39:19.925
I know.

39:19.958 --> 39:21.126
(sighs)

39:21.159 --> 39:24.029
We Reagans aren't...

39:24.062 --> 39:26.732
real gushy, but...

39:26.765 --> 39:29.535
I couldn't be more proud of you.

39:31.503 --> 39:34.506
As a woman, as a mother,
as an attorney.

39:36.508 --> 39:38.410
And you'd make a great pirate.

39:39.911 --> 39:42.180
I think you can do
anything you set your mind to.

39:42.213 --> 39:44.916
Thank you.

39:44.950 --> 39:46.518
And the Denko case

39:46.552 --> 39:48.954
is a great way
to end your legal career.

39:50.722 --> 39:53.091
I called Mayor Poole.

39:53.124 --> 39:55.126
I turned down his offer.

39:57.162 --> 39:58.497
Because of me?

39:58.530 --> 40:00.098
No.

40:03.101 --> 40:06.472
This case was as
bad as they get.

40:06.505 --> 40:11.076
But I did my job, and a brutal
criminal is going to prison,

40:11.109 --> 40:15.847
and the world's a little bit
better because of it.

40:15.881 --> 40:18.584
I can make a difference.

40:18.617 --> 40:20.552
I'm not ready to give that up.

40:22.988 --> 40:25.591
And a wise man
once said to me,

40:25.624 --> 40:28.093
"If you find something
you love to do,

40:28.126 --> 40:30.095
you'll never work
a day in your life."

40:30.128 --> 40:31.863
Not that wise.

40:33.599 --> 40:35.801
Besides, I don't know

40:35.834 --> 40:40.238
if I want to spend my days
keeping a bunch of cops in line.

40:40.271 --> 40:43.509
I do enough of that at home.
