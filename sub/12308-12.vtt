00:00.584 --> 00:02.878
Previously on Stargate Atlantis

00:04.504 --> 00:06.089
You have some Wraith DNA.

00:06.215 --> 00:08.090
My father told people
that it was a gift.

00:08.300 --> 00:11.220
I could help my people by warning
them of the Wraith's approach.

00:11.261 --> 00:13.805
If I can reach out with my
mind and establish a link...

00:14.264 --> 00:16.683
That's a little
reckless, don't you think?

00:17.142 --> 00:19.943
You are all about to die.

00:19.978 --> 00:22.940
you refer to our enemy
as the replicators.

00:22.981 --> 00:26.693
They have begun to
annihilate human worlds.

00:26.735 --> 00:28.862
Our old anti-replicator
technology relied on

00:28.904 --> 00:31.615
disrupting the bonds between
each individual nanite cell.

00:31.698 --> 00:33.165
We do the opposite.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.660
Instead of severing their connections

00:34.701 --> 00:37.037
we significantly dial up their
attraction to one another.

00:37.204 --> 00:38.705
We turn each cell into

00:38.747 --> 00:41.208
an incredibly powerful nanite magnet.

00:44.503 --> 00:46.088
Our shields can't take
much more of this,sir.

00:46.129 --> 00:47.756
Hopefully,they won't have to.

00:51.260 --> 00:52.970
son of a bitch.

00:53.845 --> 00:56.390
he actually did it.

01:02.521 --> 01:04.355
The replicator ships have ceased firing.

01:05.107 --> 01:06.775
The humans' plan worked.

01:06.942 --> 01:09.069
Give me status on the darts.

01:09.194 --> 01:10.696
Approaching the replicator city.

01:20.747 --> 01:23.375
The replicator's mass is
sinking into the planet.

01:23.709 --> 01:25.259
We do not have much time.

01:25.294 --> 01:27.129
We're not leaving without those darts.

01:34.636 --> 01:37.389
The mass is approaching
critical density.

01:37.597 --> 01:39.891
An explosion is imminent.

01:40.559 --> 01:43.270
Commander. We must jump into hyperspace.

01:43.305 --> 01:46.315
Not until I get what I came for.

01:53.322 --> 01:55.532
The darts are on approach.

01:57.075 --> 01:59.077
We have them.

02:14.926 --> 02:18.472
I have the rematerialized
cargo from the darts.

02:27.230 --> 02:30.984
Now we have what we need
to complete our mission.

{c:$ffff00}Spoils of War

03:37.050 --> 03:38.593
Rodney, what've you got?

03:38.677 --> 03:40.762
Well, it's only been a
week since the battle, but

03:40.804 --> 03:42.222
a pretty clear pattern is emerging.

03:42.264 --> 03:43.849
You can see it on the
long-range scanners.

03:43.974 --> 03:46.309
The wraith have split
up into distinct groups.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.354
Now that they're done with the
replicators, they're sizing each other up.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.690
Too many wraith, not
enough humans to feed on.

03:51.940 --> 03:54.067
Intel's claiming there are
several different factions.

03:54.109 --> 03:55.944
Yes, well, with any luck, they'll
find themselves in the middle of nice,

03:55.979 --> 03:58.530
long civil war, but what I
find particularly interesting

03:58.822 --> 03:59.906
is this.

04:02.117 --> 04:02.791
What is it?

04:02.826 --> 04:06.872
That's our old friend, the wraith that helped me
save jeannie, and got us all those hives ships.

04:06.955 --> 04:07.956
How do you know?

04:07.998 --> 04:11.084
Well, the subspace tracking device
he used? It's the same signal.

04:11.119 --> 04:12.669
Why would he reactivate it?

04:12.752 --> 04:13.837
Well, I have no idea.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.423
I think it's safe to assume that he'd
know we were monitoring that frequency.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.007
You think he's sending us a message?

04:18.043 --> 04:19.433
Maybe. Look, it's like I said

04:19.468 --> 04:21.887
the hive ships that we've been tracking
have formed into distinct groups,

04:22.095 --> 04:23.555
but this one's out there by itself.

04:23.638 --> 04:25.348
And from what we can tell, it's
floating in the middle of empty space,

04:25.383 --> 04:26.558
nowhere near a habitable planet

04:26.600 --> 04:27.767
and almost an hour's sublight

04:27.809 --> 04:29.581
from the nearest gate.

04:29.616 --> 04:31.354
So what does he want?

04:32.147 --> 04:34.816
Well, that's the question.

04:46.495 --> 04:47.746
Hey.

04:47.829 --> 04:48.788
Ronon.

04:50.499 --> 04:52.083
Do you wish to use this machine?

04:52.876 --> 04:53.710
No.

04:53.919 --> 04:55.837
I just didn't expect to find you here.

04:56.213 --> 04:57.172
Why not?

04:57.672 --> 04:59.549
Shouldn't you be taking it easy?

05:00.300 --> 05:02.093
I am pregnant, ronon, not ill.

05:02.761 --> 05:06.598
In any case, dr. Keller said it
wouldn't hurt to continue exercising.

05:06.765 --> 05:08.558
In fact, it's beneficial.

05:08.808 --> 05:10.310
You're hitting it pretty hard.

05:10.352 --> 05:12.479
I have to remain in
top physical condition

05:12.521 --> 05:15.148
if I'm to keep up with you
and the rest of the team.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.317
Who says you have to keep up?

05:26.326 --> 05:27.786
Any change?

05:28.578 --> 05:30.539
No, he's still sitting out there.

05:31.373 --> 05:33.208
It's been almost 24 hours.

05:33.500 --> 05:34.751
His ship could be disabled.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.503
You think it's a distress call?

05:36.545 --> 05:37.671
Ah, maybe.

05:37.837 --> 05:39.422
Any other hive ships
picking up the signal?

05:39.457 --> 05:41.049
If they are, they're ignoring it.

05:41.132 --> 05:42.968
We're showing no other
wraith activity in the area.

05:43.093 --> 05:44.803
How far did you say
the nearest gate was?

05:44.886 --> 05:46.429
Well, it's about an hour by jumper.

05:48.014 --> 05:49.516
I know we worked with this guy before

05:49.558 --> 05:52.143
and he has helped us out in the
past, but he's still a wraith.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.229
We don't seriously feel like
we owe him anything, do we?

05:54.264 --> 05:56.189
No, no, of course not, but

05:56.273 --> 05:58.650
that doesn't mean it's
not worth checking out.

06:05.407 --> 06:06.575
Teyla.

06:07.534 --> 06:08.618
Colonel.

06:08.868 --> 06:10.537
I just heard.

06:11.663 --> 06:13.582
I would like to accompany
you on this mission.

06:13.617 --> 06:15.500
Well, we've got it covered.

06:16.251 --> 06:18.712
John, I understand what
you're trying to do,

06:18.747 --> 06:21.881
but I assure you, it is not necessary.

06:22.591 --> 06:24.551
My skills have not diminished.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.720
I still have much to offer the team.

06:29.472 --> 06:30.765
All right, guys, let's head out.

06:31.266 --> 06:32.934
We'll wait for you at
the jumper bay, sir.

06:38.940 --> 06:40.191
I'm not even-

06:44.362 --> 06:46.781
I'm not having this conversation again.

06:46.948 --> 06:49.200
We have not had it yet.

06:49.367 --> 06:50.702
In fact, we've barely spoken

06:50.744 --> 06:52.245
since I told you I was pregnant.

06:52.370 --> 06:54.205
It's been a little busy around here.

06:54.331 --> 06:56.207
I understand why you did not want me

06:56.249 --> 06:58.460
to join the attack on
the replicator world,

06:58.495 --> 07:01.428
but that was a special circumstance.

07:01.463 --> 07:04.174
Look, even the simplest
op can become dangerous.

07:04.209 --> 07:05.050
And I accept that.

07:05.091 --> 07:06.016
You think it's that simple?

07:06.051 --> 07:07.594
Is this about you trying to protect me

07:07.636 --> 07:09.971
or are you still angry because
I did not tell you sooner?

07:10.006 --> 07:11.640
This is about your people missing.

07:11.681 --> 07:14.100
This is about the father
of your child missing.

07:14.184 --> 07:15.352
You want to go out,

07:15.393 --> 07:18.396
you want to tear it up, you
want to kick ass, but you can't!

07:18.480 --> 07:21.524
And the sooner you
realize that, the better.

07:38.541 --> 07:40.710
Pull up the hud. We're in range.

07:44.339 --> 07:46.383
I've got it, dead ahead.

07:46.591 --> 07:48.677
Looks like it's been shot up pretty bad.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.143
From the replicator battle?

07:50.178 --> 07:52.806
No, I'm picking up residual
radiation from wraith weapons fire.

07:53.390 --> 07:55.016
Were they attacked by another hive?

07:55.058 --> 07:57.227
Well, it looks that way.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.354
Any life signs?

08:00.438 --> 08:02.107
I'm not picking up anything.

08:02.440 --> 08:03.865
Maybe they're hibernating.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.610
Seems an odd thing to
do after being attacked.

08:06.736 --> 08:09.823
Plus, they usually land the ship.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.618
All right. Well, we didn't come
all this way to turn back, so, uh,

08:14.786 --> 08:16.246
I'm going in.

08:22.252 --> 08:24.379
Lorne, you got anything?

08:24.879 --> 08:26.631
Nothing so far.

08:29.884 --> 08:31.851
Oh, we've got bodies.

08:31.886 --> 08:34.222
Acknowledged. We'll keep looking.

08:46.818 --> 08:49.028
Looks like they were fed on.

08:49.279 --> 08:51.573
Still picking up the
wraith's tracking device.

08:51.614 --> 08:53.450
It's that way.

09:05.044 --> 09:07.046
Reading's stronger in here.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.514
I don't see our guy.

09:16.556 --> 09:17.682
You?

09:18.892 --> 09:20.143
No.

09:21.227 --> 09:23.486
We're not going to find him.

09:23.521 --> 09:25.148
I thought we were tracking the device.

09:25.183 --> 09:27.025
We are...

09:30.653 --> 09:33.031
but somebody cut it out of him.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.048
No sign of the rest of the crew.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.627
Whoever attacked the ship
must've taken 'em prisoner.

09:45.662 --> 09:47.003
Including our friend.

09:47.045 --> 09:48.421
Stop calling him that.

09:48.463 --> 09:50.089
It's weird.

09:50.423 --> 09:51.674
What do you want him to call him?

09:51.709 --> 09:52.634
I don't know,

09:52.675 --> 09:54.969
let's go with... todd.

09:56.471 --> 09:58.598
It's a guy I knew in
college. He was very pale.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.016
Todd's a terrible name.

10:00.058 --> 10:01.184
You got a better one?

10:01.226 --> 10:02.685
- As a matter of fact, I do.
- You know what?

10:02.769 --> 10:03.770
Forget I asked.

10:03.812 --> 10:06.147
Colonel? What do we do now?

10:06.940 --> 10:08.670
Well, that all depends.

10:08.705 --> 10:10.401
Is this thing going to fly?

10:10.443 --> 10:11.945
Well, hull's severely damaged.

10:11.986 --> 10:15.824
Um, let's see, about 30% of the ship
is sealed off and exposed to space, but,

10:15.865 --> 10:18.535
with a little work, I we can
get main systems back online.

10:18.618 --> 10:22.121
That settles it. We've
got ourselves a new ship.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.553
Colonel.

10:30.588 --> 10:32.048
I didn't expect to see you back so soon.

10:32.090 --> 10:34.342
No engagement. The only
wraith onboard were dead.

10:34.425 --> 10:35.767
Was the ship badly damaged?

10:35.802 --> 10:38.638
She's definitely taken a few hits.
Mckay's working on repairs, but

10:38.673 --> 10:40.348
that is the easy part.

10:40.431 --> 10:41.683
What's the hard part?

10:45.770 --> 10:47.063
The ship's been secured,

10:47.098 --> 10:48.356
there's no immediate danger

10:48.398 --> 10:50.149
and you're the only one who can fly it.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.443
Even in my condition?

10:53.611 --> 10:56.656
All right, I might have been
a little tough on you before.

10:57.949 --> 10:59.492
No, you were right.

10:59.576 --> 11:02.203
I'm just trying to
understand my position.

11:02.453 --> 11:04.622
You're still a member of my team.

11:04.873 --> 11:05.874
Am I?

11:05.915 --> 11:07.417
You always were.

11:08.251 --> 11:12.088
Look, it's my call whether
or not you go on a mission.

11:12.123 --> 11:14.257
Take it or leave it.

11:19.095 --> 11:20.346
When do we go?

11:25.685 --> 11:28.521
Hey. I found these in the jumper.

11:29.188 --> 11:31.399
Aw, thank you. I'm starving.

11:33.234 --> 11:34.617
"Apricot jubilee?"

11:34.652 --> 11:35.862
Well, you don't want it...

11:35.897 --> 11:37.363
no, no. That's fine.

11:38.281 --> 11:39.616
So, how are we doing in here anyways?

11:39.657 --> 11:41.958
I got the hyperdrive operational.

11:41.993 --> 11:44.913
That's not going to help if I can't
get the neural interface to work. [

11:47.081 --> 11:48.333
What'd you do?

11:48.791 --> 11:49.799
Nothing.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.085
You touched something, didn't you?

11:51.127 --> 11:52.211
No.

11:52.587 --> 11:54.422
Maybe just a little.

11:55.173 --> 11:57.050
What is it?

11:58.134 --> 11:59.309
Looks like a map.

11:59.344 --> 12:01.930
Thank you, captain obvious.
Of course, it's a map.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.641
The question is, a map to what?

12:10.480 --> 12:12.231
I wanted to tell you sooner...

12:13.399 --> 12:17.403
but I found out shortly after dr.
Keller and i returned from new athos.

12:17.445 --> 12:18.655
It was a difficult time.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.365
It's okay. I get it.

12:21.783 --> 12:23.708
Now, along with everything else,

12:23.743 --> 12:26.412
I'm burdened with the thought that...

12:26.454 --> 12:29.999
This child may be the last of my people.

12:30.041 --> 12:31.376
We don't know that yet.

12:31.411 --> 12:32.752
But you understand

12:32.794 --> 12:36.547
why I cannot just stay in
atlantis and do nothing.

12:37.840 --> 12:41.219
My best hope in learning their
fate is to be out here with you.

12:44.722 --> 12:46.057
How's it coming?

12:46.092 --> 12:47.392
Ah, you're back.

12:47.475 --> 12:50.520
Well, I've managed to get the neural
interface talking to the main systems,

12:50.555 --> 12:51.896
but I've got no way to test it,

12:51.980 --> 12:53.106
so it's going to need some tweaking.

12:53.147 --> 12:54.816
Biggest problem I've had so far
has been with the weapons array

12:54.857 --> 12:55.650
but I think I've managed to-

12:55.692 --> 12:57.694
wait. Weapons array?

12:57.735 --> 12:59.779
Well, I thought they'd come in
handy when we go after the wraith.

12:59.821 --> 13:00.828
What are you talking about?

13:00.863 --> 13:02.991
I figured out where this ship
was headed before it was attacked.

13:03.032 --> 13:04.993
We figured it out.

13:05.076 --> 13:07.662
Yeah, right. All you did
was activate a screen.

13:07.704 --> 13:09.455
I'm the one who searched
through the ship's log

13:09.497 --> 13:11.666
and found the mention of the
top-secret wraith outpost.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.584
What wraith outpost?

13:13.710 --> 13:15.176
I'm sorry, I

13:15.211 --> 13:18.256
assumed a level of uncertainty was implied
by my use of the phrase "top secret. "

13:18.381 --> 13:19.806
In other words, he doesn't know.

13:19.841 --> 13:21.884
The log didn't specify.
But whatever this thing is

13:21.926 --> 13:23.553
they talk about it like it was sacred.

13:23.678 --> 13:25.388
From what I can gather,
it played a pivotal role

13:25.430 --> 13:27.473
in helping the wraith win
their war against the ancients.

13:27.849 --> 13:29.732
Which is why we got to check it out.

13:29.767 --> 13:31.936
All right, wait, just
hold on here a second.

13:31.971 --> 13:32.944
Let's just slow down.

13:32.979 --> 13:35.690
We don't even know
if this thing can fly-

13:38.609 --> 13:39.694
How did you do that?

13:39.777 --> 13:41.821
I don't know.

13:41.904 --> 13:44.449
My abilities appear to
be stronger than before.

13:44.484 --> 13:45.658
She's not kidding!

13:46.075 --> 13:48.202
According to this,
navigation, propulsion

13:48.244 --> 13:49.871
and communications are online.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.291
Teyla?

13:53.583 --> 13:55.508
I cannot explain it.

13:55.543 --> 13:59.589
The moment I connected with the ship,
everything became available to me.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.258
I can feel the various
systems at my disposal.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.093
Can you fly it?

14:04.260 --> 14:07.138
I'm not sure.

14:18.649 --> 14:20.610
She's flying it, all right.

14:20.651 --> 14:22.403
You okay?

14:22.904 --> 14:24.739
Yes. I'm fine.

14:24.947 --> 14:27.158
It's easier than it was last time.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.660
Almost effortless.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.455
Hey, don't look at me.
I didn't do anything.

14:32.497 --> 14:35.124
The coordinates to the
outpost are in the computer.

14:35.166 --> 14:37.043
I can take us there.

14:37.085 --> 14:39.378
Mm, that's not why I brought you
here. We can wait for the daedalus.

14:39.420 --> 14:43.424
The hive that attacked this ship
had access to the same information,

14:43.508 --> 14:45.593
and, by now, it is
almost a day ahead of us.

14:45.676 --> 14:49.222
Now, if that outpost is as
important as the log suggests,

14:49.263 --> 14:51.682
do you really think
we can afford to wait?

14:51.891 --> 14:53.107
All right.

14:53.142 --> 14:54.894
Get us close, but keep
us out of sensor range.

14:54.977 --> 14:56.979
We'll take a jumper from there.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.159
Well, what's up?

15:10.576 --> 15:13.663
I decided to go over
the remainder of the log

15:13.698 --> 15:15.623
for any other mention of the outpost.

15:15.658 --> 15:16.547
And?

15:16.582 --> 15:18.167
Nothing. Can you believe it?

15:18.202 --> 15:19.717
This goes back a long way.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.213
As far as I can tell, they haven't been
to this place in thousands of years.

15:22.248 --> 15:23.464
So why now?

15:23.506 --> 15:25.341
We've reached our coordinates.

15:25.424 --> 15:27.760
I'm dropping us out of hyperspace.

15:29.679 --> 15:31.270
The planet is just ahead.

15:31.305 --> 15:33.599
I've established an orbit
around one of its moons

15:33.641 --> 15:34.892
just out of sensor range.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.854
Well, all right, let's
get to the jumper.

15:37.979 --> 15:39.188
Whoa!

15:40.189 --> 15:42.233
It's all right, I'm fine.

15:42.268 --> 15:43.860
I'm fine.

15:51.951 --> 15:56.455
This is exactly the kind of
situation I didn't want to put you in.

15:56.497 --> 15:57.874
I know.

15:59.125 --> 16:00.675
I need somebody to stay behind

16:00.710 --> 16:03.045
and fly the ship in
case we get into trouble.

16:03.080 --> 16:03.845
Of course.

16:03.880 --> 16:06.299
I'm going to have lorne
and his men stay here.

16:06.632 --> 16:08.301
Good luck.

16:21.522 --> 16:22.440
Anything?

16:22.565 --> 16:24.567
We should be in sensor range...

16:24.650 --> 16:26.194
Now.

16:27.195 --> 16:28.237
Oh.

16:28.321 --> 16:29.363
What?

16:29.405 --> 16:31.073
Well, there's a space gate.

16:31.157 --> 16:32.575
What, now you're telling me this?

16:32.617 --> 16:35.203
I didn't know! Look, the log
wasn't exactly easy reading.

16:35.238 --> 16:37.496
All right, anything else?

16:37.997 --> 16:39.123
Yeah.

16:39.248 --> 16:41.500
I'm picking up an energy
reading. On the surface.

16:41.584 --> 16:43.336
Any idea what it is?

16:43.419 --> 16:44.337
No.

16:45.213 --> 16:46.881
But there's something else...

16:47.673 --> 16:49.842
A hive ship in orbit.

16:51.552 --> 16:52.803
Well...

16:53.137 --> 16:56.057
at least we didn't miss the party.

17:05.650 --> 17:07.359
No guards.

17:07.484 --> 17:09.069
They're probably not
expecting any visitors.

17:09.105 --> 17:10.613
What say we keep it that way?

17:10.647 --> 17:11.530
Which way?

17:11.781 --> 17:13.782
The energy readings
are strongest over here.

17:19.789 --> 17:21.749
How big is this place?

17:21.958 --> 17:24.710
Don't worry. I've got an
excellent sense of direction.

17:24.794 --> 17:27.505
Didn't you say you got
lost in a garden maze once?

17:27.546 --> 17:30.132
I was 10! Plus, I was
running from a bee.

17:43.771 --> 17:46.190
What the hell is this?

17:46.225 --> 17:47.942
It's a queen.

17:47.984 --> 17:49.798
Nice work, sherlock.

17:49.833 --> 17:51.612
But what's she doing?

17:51.647 --> 17:53.114
I have no idea.

17:53.239 --> 17:54.907
Sheppard!

18:12.633 --> 18:15.261
Oh, that's just... revolting.

18:15.296 --> 18:16.595
What is it?

18:16.846 --> 18:19.307
Hey, check this out.

18:31.819 --> 18:33.529
Hey! We've got company!

18:33.738 --> 18:35.781
Go! Go! Move!

18:49.670 --> 18:51.881
This one is ready.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.820
Put him with the others.

19:19.658 --> 19:22.370
I'm definitely going to
have nightmares about that.

19:24.205 --> 19:26.415
You think this is some
kind of wraith farm?

19:26.450 --> 19:27.965
That's what itksoo like.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.963
The queen secretes genetic material, which gets
distributed through the structure into those pods.

19:32.998 --> 19:35.424
Presto, newborn wraith.

19:35.466 --> 19:36.384
Nice.

19:36.467 --> 19:38.469
Yeah, I know, it sounds disgusting

19:38.511 --> 19:40.054
but it actually makes sense.

19:40.096 --> 19:41.263
Yo rgot toemember,

19:41.305 --> 19:43.349
they're descended from insects, right?

19:45.893 --> 19:47.395
Ththing I don't understand

19:47.430 --> 19:48.646
is, why here?

19:48.687 --> 19:52.316
We always assumed that this took place on their hive ships
- but

19:52.351 --> 19:54.652
what's so special about this place?

19:55.194 --> 19:57.029
I think I have an idea.

20:04.954 --> 20:06.664
Oh, my god.

20:06.831 --> 20:08.124
Pods!

20:08.374 --> 20:09.834
Thousands of pods!

20:15.756 --> 20:17.383
Patch into the wraith console.

20:19.260 --> 20:20.928
I've got internal schematics.

20:23.806 --> 20:24.807
Whoa!

20:25.349 --> 20:26.350
What?

20:26.809 --> 20:28.269
If I'm reading this right,

20:28.352 --> 20:30.688
what we saw from the surface
was just the tip of the iceberg.

20:30.813 --> 20:32.940
This thing is miles in diameter.

20:33.899 --> 20:35.985
Are there any other chambers like this?

20:37.319 --> 20:38.988
Over a hundred.

20:44.535 --> 20:46.335
It doesn't make any sense!

20:46.370 --> 20:50.207
There's no way a single queen could provide enough
genetic material to fertilize all those pods.

20:50.291 --> 20:51.750
Maybe there's more than one.

20:51.834 --> 20:53.300
Queens don't work together.

20:53.335 --> 20:54.593
At least, not as far as we know.

20:54.628 --> 20:56.380
All I know is, this place was built to

20:56.422 --> 20:58.048
create some kind of a wraith army,

20:58.090 --> 20:59.467
and we can't let that happen.

20:59.550 --> 21:02.303
Well, you've seen how big it is. I doubt
our c-4's are going to make much of a dent.

21:02.344 --> 21:04.346
So we fire on it from orbit.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.182
Theoretically, that could work

21:06.265 --> 21:09.977
but there's another hive ship out there. They'd be
on top of us long before we could finish the job.

21:10.012 --> 21:11.812
What about the power supply, huh?

21:11.937 --> 21:12.778
Maybe.

21:12.813 --> 21:14.482
Guess we could shut
'em down for a while.

21:14.565 --> 21:15.941
That's a start.

21:19.236 --> 21:21.906
Only problem is, these readings
are coming from all around us.

21:22.072 --> 21:24.241
We're basically in the
middle of a giant machine.

21:24.366 --> 21:26.243
I'm not sure I can pinpoint the source.

21:46.514 --> 21:48.307
Wake her.

22:04.281 --> 22:06.033
What has happened?

22:06.784 --> 22:08.327
You've done well.

22:08.786 --> 22:11.539
The second batch of
warriors is flawless.

22:11.956 --> 22:14.521
We now have a suitable genetic template

22:14.556 --> 22:17.086
with which to proceed to the next phase.

22:18.087 --> 22:20.422
Where is the commander
of the fallen hive?

22:20.798 --> 22:22.800
He's in a holding cell.

22:23.175 --> 22:25.803
He completed the recalibration
that was required.

22:26.178 --> 22:28.973
I must regain my strength.

22:29.139 --> 22:31.058
Bring him to me.

22:31.642 --> 22:35.271
His understanding of this
technology is impressive.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.397
You may wish to keep him alive.

22:37.432 --> 22:39.441
You said the device was ready.

22:39.476 --> 22:40.776
It is.

22:40.859 --> 22:44.989
We are simply making final adjustments
before we bring main power online.

22:45.024 --> 22:48.284
Then he has outlived his usefulness...

22:49.159 --> 22:51.453
and I must feed.

22:51.579 --> 22:54.915
Unless you are volunteering yourself?

22:55.499 --> 22:57.293
Bring him!

23:15.185 --> 23:19.064
I believe I'm about
to receive my reward.

23:19.481 --> 23:21.358
So be it.

23:26.363 --> 23:29.241
Sheppard. How did you find me?

23:29.325 --> 23:30.826
We followed them.

23:30.909 --> 23:33.996
You picked up my signal. I
wasn't sure you would come.

23:34.455 --> 23:36.332
What are friends for?

23:36.665 --> 23:38.000
Now...

23:38.042 --> 23:39.126
tell us everything you know,

23:39.168 --> 23:41.629
or you're going to be joining
your two friends on the floor.

23:51.472 --> 23:52.848
Any word yet?

23:52.890 --> 23:55.100
No, they've not been in contact.

23:57.311 --> 23:59.772
guess there's not much
to do but wait, huh?

24:04.693 --> 24:07.780
Listen, I never got a
chance to congratulate you.

24:07.815 --> 24:09.406
That's really great.

24:09.740 --> 24:11.241
I didn't even know
you were dating anyone.

24:14.662 --> 24:16.705
My sister has a couple of kids.

24:17.039 --> 24:19.667
Two boys, five and seven.

24:20.167 --> 24:22.252
I miss being around 'em.

24:22.711 --> 24:25.297
I'm not really sure what to expect.

24:27.383 --> 24:29.176
Nobody ever is.

24:29.385 --> 24:31.679
At least, not with the first one.

24:32.179 --> 24:33.972
But you get through it.

24:36.141 --> 24:38.227
You're going to make a great mom.

24:38.977 --> 24:40.562
Thank you.

24:41.271 --> 24:43.357
I wish I could be so sure.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.531
Dr. Mckay is quite correct.

24:50.614 --> 24:53.826
It would be impossible for a queen
to breed so many warriors all at once,

24:53.861 --> 24:55.828
except by artificial means.

24:55.869 --> 24:57.378
What are you talking about?

24:57.413 --> 24:59.790
The queen creates a handful of warriors,

24:59.915 --> 25:02.876
each of which is then reproduced
thousands of times over.

25:03.043 --> 25:05.045
This is a cloning facility.

25:05.254 --> 25:07.923
That's why it was key to their
victory over the ancients.

25:07.965 --> 25:11.093
We always knew they did it with greater
numbers, we just never knew where they came from.

25:11.635 --> 25:14.186
Aren't there too many
wraith in the galaxy already?

25:14.221 --> 25:16.473
A couple of weeks ago, when you
were fighting the replicators,

25:16.515 --> 25:17.850
it might've made sense, but why now?

25:19.351 --> 25:20.686
Answer the man.

25:23.564 --> 25:25.983
We didn't use this facility
during the replicator war

25:26.024 --> 25:28.068
because we didn't have
the means to power it.

25:28.110 --> 25:30.738
The energy requirements are enormous.

25:30.773 --> 25:32.197
Zpms.

25:32.322 --> 25:34.283
He's talking about zpms.

25:34.366 --> 25:37.995
I managed to acquire a few before
the replicator planet was destroyed.

25:38.030 --> 25:40.629
And I was all set to feel
bad about killing you.

25:40.664 --> 25:43.876
My intention was to create an
army to wipe out the other wraith

25:43.917 --> 25:46.128
but I was betrayed by one of my crew.

25:46.211 --> 25:48.922
He had informed another
hive of my plans.

25:48.964 --> 25:51.759
The one that disabled your ship?

25:52.509 --> 25:54.309
This is good news, right?

25:54.344 --> 25:57.514
It means all we have to do to shut this
place down is get our hands on those zpms.

25:57.639 --> 25:59.224
And I know where they are.

25:59.308 --> 26:02.060
I'm sure you haven't come
all this way just to rescue me

26:02.102 --> 26:03.979
but it would be in your best interest.

26:06.482 --> 26:07.941
Let's go.

26:19.328 --> 26:20.913
Through there.

26:21.079 --> 26:23.457
We'll see if it's clear, you stay here.

26:29.505 --> 26:31.006
There's one thing I don't understand.

26:31.089 --> 26:34.092
Back when you defeated the ancients,
how did you get your hands on a zpm?

26:34.218 --> 26:37.262
The lantians were
powerful, but careless.

26:37.346 --> 26:42.434
Believing their ships were unbeatable, they sent them
deeper and deeper into wraith-controlled territory,

26:42.469 --> 26:44.353
trying to weed us out.

26:44.394 --> 26:47.272
It took months, but, eventually, we
were able to capture three of them,

26:47.307 --> 26:49.983
each one powered by a zpm.

26:50.108 --> 26:51.819
At which point, you
brought them back here.

26:51.860 --> 26:56.573
Within weeks, our army had grown to
hundreds of times its original size.

26:57.366 --> 26:59.868
From that point on, the tide
of war turned in our favor,

26:59.910 --> 27:01.912
and there was nothing
the lantians could do.

27:01.954 --> 27:04.164
Save the history lesson
for later. Let's go.

27:04.199 --> 27:05.749
Right.

27:11.713 --> 27:13.215
They've discovered my absence!

27:13.298 --> 27:15.509
Well, then we're going
to have to move quickly.

27:25.602 --> 27:26.520
This way!

27:31.483 --> 27:32.526
Go!

27:56.174 --> 27:57.759
Oh, man.

27:59.511 --> 28:00.762
I got stunned.

28:00.804 --> 28:03.307
Yeah, we know, rodney. We all did.

28:04.683 --> 28:06.727
How come I'm the last one to wake up?

28:10.022 --> 28:11.064
So, where's todd?

28:11.148 --> 28:12.482
He escaped.

28:12.524 --> 28:13.859
Well, that's good, isn't it?

28:13.942 --> 28:16.194
He'll come back for us. I
mean, after all, we saved him.

28:16.570 --> 28:18.906
Something tells me we're
on our own with this one.

28:18.941 --> 28:20.866
Something tells me it's
not going to matter.

28:27.748 --> 28:28.832
Open it.

28:33.086 --> 28:35.505
You're letting us out, huh?
That's very kind of you.

28:35.589 --> 28:36.757
Bring them.

28:52.064 --> 28:54.650
The commander of the other hive escaped,

28:54.816 --> 28:57.110
but I brought you these.

29:13.919 --> 29:16.088
inform the hive.

29:16.129 --> 29:19.549
Have them begin searching
the area for their ship.

29:20.050 --> 29:21.969
In the meantime,

29:22.052 --> 29:25.555
I have a few questions
that need to be answered.

29:27.933 --> 29:28.982
What is it?

29:29.017 --> 29:31.436
I have detected a dart
approaching our position.

29:32.354 --> 29:33.689
Could be a scout.

29:33.730 --> 29:34.940
Have they spotted us?

29:34.982 --> 29:35.941
I don't know.

29:35.983 --> 29:38.610
Have you detected any communication
between the dart and the other hive?

29:38.645 --> 29:39.159
No.

29:39.194 --> 29:40.362
Well, then we still have a chance.

29:40.404 --> 29:42.155
We should destroy it.

29:42.197 --> 29:44.366
Colonel sheppard has
flown a dart before.

29:44.401 --> 29:46.124
Would've radioed us by now

29:46.159 --> 29:48.620
and we can't risk sending
out a signal of our own.

29:54.376 --> 29:56.378
Charging weapons.

29:58.755 --> 30:00.215
Do not fire.

30:00.382 --> 30:02.551
You recognize me?

30:02.718 --> 30:04.136
Yes.

30:04.678 --> 30:06.555
Have you seen our people?

30:06.590 --> 30:07.681
I have.

30:07.723 --> 30:11.101
I will tell you everything,
but you must allow me onboard.

30:16.481 --> 30:17.941
They were captured?

30:17.976 --> 30:19.401
I saw them get stunned.

30:20.318 --> 30:22.077
Funny how you managed to get away.

30:22.112 --> 30:24.906
I was lucky. If I had been captured,
they would have killed me instantly.

30:25.032 --> 30:26.616
So how do we rescue them?

30:26.658 --> 30:28.994
By now, they will have been
brought before the queen.

30:29.161 --> 30:31.705
So there's still a chance,
if you fly us back down there.

30:31.788 --> 30:33.665
You don't understand.

30:33.790 --> 30:35.375
The hive in orbit will have detected

30:35.417 --> 30:36.550
my dart leaving the planet.

30:36.585 --> 30:39.212
They will grow suspicious
and begin searching for us.

30:39.296 --> 30:42.674
Our only hope is to leave now
and come again later undetected.

30:42.709 --> 30:44.426
We're not going anywhere.

30:44.509 --> 30:47.345
There is no way to help
your friends right now.

30:47.637 --> 30:49.097
You must face this.

30:49.264 --> 30:50.599
Wait.

30:50.724 --> 30:52.476
There is a chance.

30:52.517 --> 30:54.227
I have an idea.

30:54.686 --> 30:57.439
How were you able to find this place?

31:00.358 --> 31:02.117
I don't believe that

31:02.152 --> 31:07.115
I have ever encountered such
resistance from a human before.

31:07.157 --> 31:09.117
I've had my practice.

31:10.243 --> 31:12.871
Well... there is a simpler way.

31:13.914 --> 31:15.499
Tell me what I want to know,

31:15.624 --> 31:18.960
or I feed on one of your friends.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.422
As you wish.

31:22.589 --> 31:25.217
If you're hungry, I'm the
one you're looking for.

31:25.252 --> 31:26.183
This one!

31:26.218 --> 31:29.387
Oh, great. My entire life,
I've never been chosen first-

31:32.432 --> 31:34.559
And now fate decides
to restore the balance?

31:49.950 --> 31:51.201
What is it?

31:51.451 --> 31:53.161
My queen?

31:54.412 --> 31:56.289
Take them back to their cell.

31:58.166 --> 31:59.209
I do not understand.

31:59.244 --> 32:01.378
Get out!

32:11.471 --> 32:12.806
What did she say?

32:12.931 --> 32:14.808
She's not talking to us.

32:14.850 --> 32:17.477
She's taking control
of the queen's mind.

32:17.602 --> 32:19.521
Impossible.

32:19.771 --> 32:22.732
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

32:34.411 --> 32:38.665
Who is this who dares to enter my mind?

32:39.749 --> 32:42.669
Who I am does not matter.

32:42.794 --> 32:47.340
What matters is that
I am stronger than you.

32:47.549 --> 32:49.467
Really?

32:49.968 --> 32:54.055
Even now I am gaining
control of your body.

32:57.058 --> 33:01.271
Yes, you do have strength.

33:01.438 --> 33:04.232
I can feel it now.

33:04.357 --> 33:10.155
But even you cannot sustain this
level of concentration forever.

33:10.405 --> 33:13.450
I do not need forever.

33:13.783 --> 33:16.912
Now... get up!

33:26.796 --> 33:29.174
Turn right.

33:36.473 --> 33:40.810
You are hiding something from me.

33:44.814 --> 33:47.609
I can sense it.

33:52.030 --> 33:54.199
Of course.

33:55.033 --> 33:57.452
Now I feel it.

33:58.912 --> 34:01.248
You're not working alone.

34:01.456 --> 34:04.751
There is another life... inside you.

34:04.834 --> 34:07.629
Helping you.

34:14.469 --> 34:16.638
Stay away!

34:17.554 --> 34:20.308
You cannot resist me for long!

34:20.391 --> 34:25.021
Combined, your two
minds are very powerful,

34:25.063 --> 34:32.112
but all I need to do is distract you for
a single moment to get to the other...

34:33.405 --> 34:37.158
One thought... is all it will take

34:37.199 --> 34:41.329
to crush it out of existence.

34:45.041 --> 34:46.793
That was just weird.

34:46.828 --> 34:47.752
"Weird?"

34:47.793 --> 34:49.587
Did you see how close I just
came to becoming wraith food?

34:49.629 --> 34:51.214
I don't think "weird"
quite cuts it. Like,

34:51.255 --> 34:53.675
maybe "paralyzing," or
"sickening," or "heart-stopping. "

34:53.710 --> 34:54.884
What do you think happened to her?

34:54.918 --> 34:56.177
I'm not sure.

35:02.225 --> 35:04.227
Oh, great. She's back.

35:07.564 --> 35:10.734
Here are your weapons.

35:13.820 --> 35:15.530
It's me, john.

35:15.905 --> 35:17.407
Teyla?

35:17.699 --> 35:19.492
Yes.

35:21.161 --> 35:24.539
You are weakening. I can feel it.

35:25.540 --> 35:26.791
Teyla?

35:28.710 --> 35:30.211
Teyla, you okay?

35:32.714 --> 35:35.091
You must go, quickly!

35:35.342 --> 35:37.886
I do not know how much
longer I can control her.

35:37.921 --> 35:38.977
Go. Move.

35:39.012 --> 35:40.930
Can you get her to tell us which
way? I kind of got turned around.

35:40.965 --> 35:42.223
Just go!

35:44.351 --> 35:45.894
You can let go of her
now. We're leaving.

35:47.312 --> 35:49.272
There it is!

35:49.397 --> 35:53.485
The other life inside you.

35:53.568 --> 35:55.028
Teyla? Let go.

35:55.070 --> 35:56.404
John

35:56.529 --> 35:58.573
help me!

36:03.495 --> 36:05.372
Teyla!

36:06.247 --> 36:08.833
Let's pull out those zpms
and get the hell out of here.

36:08.917 --> 36:10.752
The only problem is, we have no
idea where they are, remember?

36:10.787 --> 36:12.667
We pulled up the
schematics in the pod room.

36:12.702 --> 36:14.547
It didn't have any
reference to the zpms.

36:14.631 --> 36:16.174
Maybe you didn't look hard enough

36:16.257 --> 36:18.259
Let's go.

36:33.858 --> 36:34.859
Make this quick.

36:34.901 --> 36:37.028
There's a lot of data.
I'm going to need a minute.

36:44.077 --> 36:45.829
What was that?

36:47.914 --> 36:50.083
We're too late.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.903
They started to clone the warriors.

36:57.938 --> 36:59.286
Forget that. Just find the zpms.

36:59.321 --> 37:00.600
I'm going to need more time!

37:00.635 --> 37:03.847
- Rodney.
- There're hundreds of pages here and it's all in wraith.

37:05.432 --> 37:06.731
They found the queen.

37:06.766 --> 37:08.810
All right. I got a better idea.

37:08.852 --> 37:09.651
You do?

37:09.686 --> 37:11.438
Let's get out of here.

37:15.316 --> 37:17.026
Teyla, are you okay?

37:18.236 --> 37:19.279
Major lorne?

37:19.320 --> 37:20.655
What happened?

37:20.697 --> 37:22.240
I saw them-

37:22.407 --> 37:25.201
colonel sheppard, ronon, dr. Mckay.

37:25.236 --> 37:26.119
Did they get away?

37:26.286 --> 37:28.955
The queen was...

37:29.038 --> 37:30.547
was going after my child.

37:30.582 --> 37:33.418
It's okay, it's okay. Just
take it easy, all right?

37:35.170 --> 37:36.713
Major

37:37.255 --> 37:39.757
The other hive is on its way.

37:40.300 --> 37:42.218
They've found us.

37:49.851 --> 37:51.728
Isn't there another way out of here?

37:51.769 --> 37:53.188
You want a different exit?

37:53.271 --> 37:54.898
It was hard to find this one!

37:55.398 --> 37:58.026
Make a decision fast. We've
got more of 'em coming.

37:58.735 --> 38:00.737
Oh, crap.

38:13.374 --> 38:15.502
Let's get out of here!

38:28.848 --> 38:31.476
The hive ship will be here
momentarily. We need to leave now.

38:31.511 --> 38:33.895
Not before our people get back.

38:34.062 --> 38:36.606
Weapons capability is limited at best.

38:36.940 --> 38:39.400
The hull is still severely damaged.

38:39.526 --> 38:41.242
We can't survive an attack.

38:41.277 --> 38:43.112
Colonel sheppard will be here shortly.

38:43.147 --> 38:44.329
You don't know that.

38:44.364 --> 38:46.122
I have seen them! They are alive,

38:46.157 --> 38:48.701
and we will wait for
as long as is necessary.

38:50.703 --> 38:51.975
What's that?

38:52.010 --> 38:53.248
The other hive.

38:53.373 --> 38:55.542
They've entered weapons range.

39:02.173 --> 39:05.802
They will target our hyperdrive,
making it impossible to escape.

39:05.969 --> 39:08.346
We can't wait any longer!

39:10.390 --> 39:11.745
Teyla, lorne, come in.

39:11.780 --> 39:13.101
Colonel, where are you?

39:13.136 --> 39:14.025
On our way.

39:14.060 --> 39:16.229
You must hurry. The
other hive has found us.

39:16.264 --> 39:17.480
Can you hold them off?

39:17.515 --> 39:19.107
Not for long.

39:29.534 --> 39:31.077
Approaching dart bay.

39:31.119 --> 39:32.662
Acknowledged.

39:32.829 --> 39:34.045
They're inside.

39:34.080 --> 39:36.791
Colonel, request permission to
jump to hyperspace immediately.

39:36.833 --> 39:38.751
Negative. I have another idea.

39:38.918 --> 39:40.086
Are you crazy?

39:40.211 --> 39:42.762
We still have to destroy
the cloning facility.

39:42.797 --> 39:44.799
How? In case you hadn't
noticed, we're under attack.

39:44.834 --> 39:46.015
I know!

39:46.050 --> 39:48.469
Teyla, set a new course.

39:56.019 --> 39:56.999
Commander

39:57.034 --> 39:57.979
What is it?

39:58.021 --> 40:00.982
We just received an urgent
communication from the hive.

40:01.816 --> 40:03.067
The enemy,

40:03.109 --> 40:05.653
they're headed straight for us.

40:29.552 --> 40:32.597
Well, I think that should
probably do the trick.

40:33.139 --> 40:35.433
Let's get out of here.

40:46.944 --> 40:48.655
So, what happened to the other wraith?

40:48.696 --> 40:50.114
You mean todd?

40:50.156 --> 40:51.991
- Don't ask.
- He took a dart.

40:52.075 --> 40:53.826
Either he escaped through
the gate like we did,

40:53.868 --> 40:55.453
or he was captured by
the other hive ship.

40:55.745 --> 40:58.331
I can't imagine they could have
given him a very warm welcome.

40:58.498 --> 40:59.666
No.

41:14.097 --> 41:15.598
Talked to keller?

41:16.099 --> 41:17.725
I've just come from the infirmary.

41:17.760 --> 41:19.560
Everything is fine.

41:19.644 --> 41:22.063
At least, physically.

41:22.397 --> 41:23.940
What does that mean?

41:27.402 --> 41:31.322
I exposed my unborn child
to the mind of a killer...

41:32.031 --> 41:34.784
even before he has opened
his eyes on the world.

41:35.827 --> 41:37.078
He?

41:38.204 --> 41:39.747
It's a boy.

41:40.832 --> 41:41.791
Really?

41:42.834 --> 41:45.503
I thought you didn't want
keller to tell you anything.

41:46.170 --> 41:47.630
She didn'T.

41:48.715 --> 41:50.174
Okay...

41:53.219 --> 41:54.637
you were right

41:54.721 --> 41:57.849
to question my involvement
in this mission.

41:58.599 --> 42:01.686
There was a time when I would
have laid down my life for you

42:01.978 --> 42:04.021
or ronon, or rodney

42:04.188 --> 42:06.482
without hesitation.

42:07.024 --> 42:08.151
But...

42:09.068 --> 42:11.654
I have other considerations now.

42:11.988 --> 42:14.031
That's understandable.

42:16.033 --> 42:19.036
You have no idea how close she came

42:19.287 --> 42:21.956
to extinguishing his life.

42:24.459 --> 42:30.923
If you had hesitated
for even a moment...
