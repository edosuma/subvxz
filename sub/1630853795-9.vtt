Crazy Joe.
Joseph England.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.134
You all went
to school with him.

01:33.218 --> 01:34.761
He's the one who sent us
those creepy text messages

01:34.844 --> 01:37.347
and you all those "gifts."

01:37.430 --> 01:41.351
It was a classic
Agatha Christie revenge plot.

01:41.434 --> 01:43.686
He was in love
with Angela Waters
in high school,

01:43.770 --> 01:45.230
and years later,

01:45.313 --> 01:47.190
set about punishing
the people who were,

01:47.273 --> 01:50.193
in his mind,
somehow a party
to her death.

We're assuming they found Joe.

02:07.293 --> 02:11.422
We're also assuming they
assumed it was a suicide.

02:11.506 --> 02:13.299
Why kill himself?
After everything?

02:13.383 --> 02:18.054
We think probably
because Imogen
busted his ass...

02:18.137 --> 02:20.557
discovered his identity,
where he was living.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.267
Also, maybe...

02:22.350 --> 02:25.395
because he accomplished
what he set out to do.

02:26.813 --> 02:29.566
"Punish the guilty."

02:29.649 --> 02:33.027

-So, now it's time for you

02:33.111 --> 02:34.737

02:34.821 --> 02:37.240

Horrible, mean girl bullies.

02:51.462 --> 02:53.298
Angela and I...

02:53.381 --> 02:55.592
were in a secret
relationship,

02:55.675 --> 02:56.467
but I denied it

02:56.551 --> 02:59.137
and said she was
obsessed with me.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.183
I talked Angela into
getting a tattoo.

03:04.267 --> 03:07.520
Even though I knew she'd
get in trouble for it

03:07.604 --> 03:08.146

03:10.899 --> 03:14.319

the janitor caught us,

Why were you all
so cruel to Angela?

03:36.841 --> 03:38.760

03:38.843 --> 03:41.429

03:44.515 --> 03:46.059
Angela was...

03:46.893 --> 03:49.437
-an easy target.
-It was a game.

03:49.520 --> 03:51.648
A, a terrible game.
