<i>In the middle of Huntington,</i>
<i>West Virginia, there is a river.</i>

01:03.897 --> 01:06.991
<i>Next to this river, there is a steel mill.</i>

01:11.738 --> 01:14.866
<i>And next to the steel mill,</i>
<i>there is a school.</i>

01:20.246 --> 01:23.511
<i>In the middle of this school,</i>
<i>there is a fountain.</i>

01:25.919 --> 01:31.414
<i>Each year, on the exact same day,</i>
<i>at the exact same hour...</i>

01:31.591 --> 01:34.424
<i>...the water to this fountain is turned off.</i>

01:35.762 --> 01:39.027
<i>And in this moment, once every year...</i>

01:40.133 --> 01:44.194
<i>...throughout the town,</i>
<i>throughout the school...</i>

01:45.405 --> 01:47.771
<i>...time stands still.</i>

02:04.958 --> 02:07.984
Chris Griffen with a reception.
That is a first down.

02:08.161 --> 02:13.224
<i>But Marshall is all out of time-outs,</i>
<i>and the clock is now ticking.</i>

02:13.399 --> 02:16.562
<i>If they wanna get another play off,</i>
<i>the Herd had better hurry.</i>

02:17.570 --> 02:20.368
Call it in, Red! Call it in!

02:23.510 --> 02:27.810
-Griffen! Okay, Chris Griffen! Hustle up!
-l'm good, l'm good.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.710
The Herd looks a little disorganized.

02:29.883 --> 02:34.081
They're looking for a play from the sideline,
and they are almost out of time.

02:34.254 --> 02:37.382
<i>We are talking about seconds.</i>
<i>Marshall needs to get down and over--</i>

02:37.557 --> 02:39.548
-77-Victory. Go! Go, go, go!
-Yes, sir.

02:39.726 --> 02:41.557
77-Victory. You're out.

02:42.362 --> 02:46.423
V, 77! V, 77!

02:52.305 --> 02:53.932
Come on! Snap the ball!

02:54.807 --> 02:56.297
Set!

02:57.010 --> 03:01.003
Snap it! Snap it! Snap it!

03:01.915 --> 03:03.382
Come on!

03:04.250 --> 03:05.547
Hut!

03:14.527 --> 03:17.223
Strong side! He's open!

03:17.397 --> 03:19.763
He's open! Throw!

03:34.047 --> 03:36.777
<i>And that'll be it for the Herd.</i>

03:38.084 --> 03:40.314
That's right, the clock has hit all zeroes...

03:40.486 --> 03:43.546
<i>...and the Carolina faithful</i>
<i>are already on their feet.</i>

03:43.723 --> 03:44.951
<i>So there you have it.</i>

03:45.124 --> 03:46.887
<i>-It's all over, folks.</i>
-Good game, Red.

03:47.060 --> 03:51.554
<i>Marshall loses a tough one,</i>
<i>1 7- 1 4 to the East Carolina Pirates.</i>

03:51.731 --> 03:53.562
Red's got his work cut out for him.

03:53.733 --> 03:57.965
Well, there goes my weekend.
Red'll be in the film room till Monday.

03:58.137 --> 03:59.434
He'd better.

03:59.606 --> 04:02.404
Your husband hasn't figured out
how to beat the 3-4 all year.

04:02.575 --> 04:04.907
<i>Co-captain Nate Ruffin</i>
<i>and cornerback Tom Bogdan...</i>

04:05.078 --> 04:08.639
<i>...are two of four starters who were</i>
<i>left back in Huntington due to injuries.</i>

04:08.815 --> 04:12.683
Surprised to see you. Figured the chairman
of the school board would be at the game.

04:12.852 --> 04:15.047
This place won't run itself,
you know that.

04:15.221 --> 04:17.951
-Furnace ready for the tap?
-Yeah.

04:20.793 --> 04:23.489
<i>The next week is a must-win.</i>

04:23.663 --> 04:25.460
They're all must-wins, Gene.

04:25.632 --> 04:29.728
<i>No word yet on whether any or all of the</i>
<i>injured players will be available next--</i>

04:34.641 --> 04:37.804
Hey, Sandy, can l get
some more foil in here?

04:38.678 --> 04:42.944
<i>The score, 1 7- 1 4, East Carolina Pirates.</i>
<i>Quarterback Teddy Shoebridge....</i>

04:43.116 --> 04:44.583
l got it!

04:49.322 --> 04:53.315
Hey, where's the flag?
Where's the flag? Flag on--

04:53.493 --> 04:57.020
Fifty-five! Blocking in the--

04:57.196 --> 05:00.097
--if that confusion on the Marshall sideline
at the end of the game...

05:00.266 --> 05:04.202
...won't make that target on
Coach Tolley's back a little bit bigger.

05:04.370 --> 05:08.238
l'm not gonna ask you guys again.
Dinner's ready.

05:09.809 --> 05:11.640
That means you too, Keith.

05:11.811 --> 05:14.609
Please, just a few more seconds?
Dad's not off yet.

05:14.781 --> 05:17.944
He'll still be droning on about that game
when he gets home tonight.

05:18.117 --> 05:20.176
Get out from under there,
Keith Morehouse.

05:20.353 --> 05:24.881
l'm Gene Morehouse saying
good night, and go Herd!

05:25.158 --> 05:26.455
Fellas...

05:28.027 --> 05:30.393
...you gave a good effort out there today.

05:33.066 --> 05:35.193
But let me be clear about this:

05:35.601 --> 05:39.093
A good effort is not enough.

05:42.842 --> 05:44.707
Now, l'm proud of you.

05:46.479 --> 05:49.141
But l will not accept losing with you.

05:49.749 --> 05:52.081
Because there's only one thing
they judge us on.

05:52.251 --> 05:54.981
There's only one thing people remember.

05:56.022 --> 05:58.684
And it ain't how we play the game!

06:02.762 --> 06:04.354
Winning...

06:05.398 --> 06:07.025
...is everything.

06:11.003 --> 06:12.368
Plane leaves in an hour.

06:13.139 --> 06:15.198
We'll be home by 8.

06:15.375 --> 06:19.539
Plenty of time for y'all to do whatever
the hell y'all do on a Saturday night.

06:24.317 --> 06:27.286
Now, see, Bogdan, the reason we lost
is because we weren't there.

06:27.453 --> 06:31.321
Chocolate Thunder, White Lightning? We the
best defensive players in the conference.

06:31.491 --> 06:32.856
l'm Chocolate Thunder, right?

06:33.025 --> 06:35.721
Why you so scared to introduce me
to your girlfriend, then?

06:35.895 --> 06:37.920
Listen, stop being so
overconfident, Ruffin.

06:38.097 --> 06:41.863
All right, Rock, Paper, Scissors for tickets.
Let's go, right now.

06:44.103 --> 06:45.593
lt's okay. l'll get the popcorn.

06:45.772 --> 06:47.433
East Carolina?

06:47.607 --> 06:50.440
l mean, l can understand giving up
300 yards to Bowling Green.

06:50.610 --> 06:51.941
But East Carolina?

06:52.111 --> 06:55.137
Well, you can't do nothing
about injuries, you know?

06:55.715 --> 06:57.706
What happened? ls it broken?

06:57.884 --> 06:59.784
lt's dislocated.

06:59.952 --> 07:01.943
What's wrong with you, Tom?

07:02.922 --> 07:04.822
Come on, man. Gonna miss the previews.

07:04.991 --> 07:09.223
Nineteen carries, 1 08 yards, Paul,
your boy Chris played a hell of a game.

07:09.395 --> 07:11.863
l'd have taken the win any day.
lsn't that right, Don?

07:12.031 --> 07:14.056
What, now, we didn't win?

07:15.435 --> 07:18.404
You of all people, Don.
lf you're not gonna listen to the game...

07:18.571 --> 07:21.165
...you gotta know the result
so you can pretend you did.

07:21.340 --> 07:23.535
-Well, l'm doing my best, Paul.
-You hungry?

07:23.709 --> 07:25.643
No, thank you. l'm all set.

07:25.812 --> 07:28.645
Lloyd? Usual for me tonight,
just more of it. l'm starving.

07:28.815 --> 07:30.874
-You got it.
-Go ahead, excuse me.

07:31.050 --> 07:34.042
Well, the board has asked me
to run a few ideas through you...

07:34.220 --> 07:38.281
...about some potential improvements
to the university's physical plant.

07:48.634 --> 07:50.363
There's Chris!

07:53.773 --> 07:57.174
What took you so long to call?
Tell Joe he can't run it to the inside....

07:57.343 --> 07:59.971
Slow down, Reggie. Just listen.

08:00.146 --> 08:03.946
-l just need a favor, not your life story.
-What you need?

08:04.116 --> 08:08.985
l need you to go get us a case
of Falls City Beer. Falls City.

08:09.155 --> 08:12.750
-Go to the liquor store on Fourth. Yeah.
<i>-Fourth Street?</i>

08:12.925 --> 08:15.519
-Hey, are the guys with you?
-Yeah, Reggie.

08:15.695 --> 08:17.686
What is it, godd--?

08:18.364 --> 08:21.800
That's right, Reggie. You carry the two
and you divide by the sum....

08:21.968 --> 08:25.460
Yeah, math class is over.
Let's get on the plane. Come on.

08:28.241 --> 08:31.039
-l'll see you in a couple of hours, right?
-You know you are.

08:31.210 --> 08:33.337
-l'm gonna stay at my dad's house tonight.
-No.

08:33.513 --> 08:36.208
He's gonna wanna go over his
post-game breakdown.

08:36.649 --> 08:39.015
Sorry. We've been doing it
since l was a kid.

08:39.184 --> 08:41.346
You gonna tell him about California, right?

08:41.520 --> 08:45.355
Are you kidding? After a loss?
We want him in a good mood.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.117
Yeah.

08:47.393 --> 08:50.157
Don't worry. l will.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.166
Just not this weekend.

08:54.333 --> 08:56.460
Griffen! Let's go!

08:57.436 --> 08:59.427
l love you, Chris Griffen.

09:00.506 --> 09:02.497
Come on, Annie!

09:04.410 --> 09:06.844
-Race you back.
-Let's go! Hurry up!

09:07.013 --> 09:08.913
l'm coming!

09:14.520 --> 09:16.249
What's this concert you're missing?

09:16.422 --> 09:20.415
lt's just my granddaughter's piano recital.
Man, she sure is cute when she does that.

09:20.593 --> 09:23.391
That's the crap l missed
first time around with my boys.

09:23.563 --> 09:24.996
Now they got kids of their own.

09:25.164 --> 09:28.224
Anyway, got a long ride ahead of me.
Have a great flight.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.995
Hutch, tell you what,
l'll do the recruiting trip.

09:31.170 --> 09:35.607
You go home and see your granddaughter's
recital. l'm gonna do it. l'm doing it.

09:37.910 --> 09:40.743
-Thanks, Red. All right.
-l'll see you on Monday morning.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.447
Good man, Red.

09:45.318 --> 09:47.684
You can grab me a beer back home.

09:57.463 --> 10:00.591
<i>Because if he keeps on pulling</i>
<i>and no money comes out....</i>

10:00.766 --> 10:02.358
-Good evening.
<i>-Doris.</i>

10:02.535 --> 10:05.436
lt's Red Dawson, calling from Greenville.

10:06.472 --> 10:09.373
Could l trouble you to look and see
if Carole's home next door?

10:12.178 --> 10:13.611
Sure doesn't look like it, Red.

10:13.779 --> 10:16.646
Could you do me a big favor
and leave her a message for me?

10:16.816 --> 10:20.183
Tell her that l gotta drive to Virginia
tonight on a recruiting trip...

10:20.353 --> 10:22.378
<i>...and I'm not gonna be home</i>
<i>till tomorrow.</i>

10:22.555 --> 10:24.716
-Got it.
<i>-All right, you have a good night, now.</i>

10:24.890 --> 10:27.415
-All right, bye.
<i>-Night, Red.</i>

10:45.011 --> 10:48.572
-You thinking about that girlfriend of yours?
-Yeah, coach.

10:50.016 --> 10:51.677
Nice job, son.

10:53.019 --> 10:54.816
Hey, that was a big hit today. Big hit.

10:54.987 --> 10:57.080
l would've caught that pass
if l had my cross.

10:57.256 --> 10:58.484
What'd you do with it?

10:58.658 --> 11:02.116
You would've caught it if you had good
hands. Ain't that right, Shoebridge?

11:02.294 --> 11:07.163
Hey, Gene, this is gonna sound a little
weird, but l need you to do me a favor.

11:07.333 --> 11:10.530
Want you to scratch my back.
That target on there is starting to itch.

11:10.703 --> 11:13.035
You can't believe everything
you hear on the radio.

11:13.205 --> 11:15.105
Oh, yeah, l can.

11:18.577 --> 11:23.344
All right, boys, let's sit up straight.
Tighten those ties, fix those collars.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.450
-We are?
-Marshall!

11:26.252 --> 11:27.719
Almost home.

11:30.222 --> 11:32.452
<i>This is Captain Dettro speaking.</i>

11:32.625 --> 11:35.287
<i>Looks like we made good time</i>
<i>in spite of the weather...</i>

11:35.461 --> 11:40.262
<i>...so if everyone could return to their</i>
<i>seats now, we'll be landing shortly.</i>

12:09.729 --> 12:11.526
Fill her up for you?

12:11.764 --> 12:13.129
Yes, sir.

12:18.871 --> 12:20.600
These peanuts look good.

12:22.274 --> 12:24.208
l'll get a bunch of them too.

12:24.376 --> 12:27.504
Sure. They're just 50 cents.
Help yourself.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.649
Regular's on the left,
Cajun's on the right.

12:30.816 --> 12:33.080
<i>Incredibly, there has been</i>
<i>another plane crash....</i>

12:33.252 --> 12:34.981

12:40.459 --> 12:42.324
-Wait. Turn that up.
-No, what happened--

12:42.495 --> 12:43.723
What did that say?

12:43.896 --> 12:47.457
<i>Early reports do not indicate</i>
<i>the condition of those aboard.</i>

12:54.140 --> 12:55.437
Excuse me, everybody....

12:55.608 --> 12:57.007
<i>Annette said you look funny</i>
<i>when you're getting dressed.</i>

13:02.615 --> 13:04.708
Bye, Carole.
Say hello to your husband for me.

13:04.884 --> 13:07.717
-This is Lloyd.
-See you, Lloyd!

13:15.594 --> 13:17.152
What's happened?

13:29.742 --> 13:31.437
Hey!

13:34.180 --> 13:36.876
-Hey, you going to the airport?
-Yeah, get in.

13:37.049 --> 13:40.917
All right. l'm getting in. Hold on.
All right, good.

13:59.905 --> 14:02.135
-Hey, did they say anything?
-Hey, come on!

14:02.308 --> 14:05.766
No one's going in there.
l can't let you up there.

14:05.945 --> 14:07.970
-Get that truck up the hill!
-Come on!

Got the president of the university here!

Let's go.

14:53.158 --> 14:56.184
-Hey, get behind the ropes!
-Just tell us the name of the airline!

14:56.362 --> 14:59.729
-lf l knew anything, l'd tell you!
-Just look at the front of the plane!

14:59.899 --> 15:02.925
Son, there is no
front of the plane anymore.

15:06.538 --> 15:07.903
Bring another hose down here!

15:08.073 --> 15:10.837
No, stay back. Stay up there! No!

15:11.010 --> 15:14.002
-Let's go!
-Nate! Nate Ruffin!

This our boys' plane?
This our boys' plane?!

16:48.774 --> 16:50.674
lt's so terrible.

17:39.024 --> 17:40.252
You didn't get my message?

18:00.712 --> 18:04.170
<i>Marshall University in West Virginia</i>
<i>is in a state of shock today...</i>

18:04.349 --> 18:08.877
<i>...following the terrible tragedy of last</i>
<i>Saturday night's crash of a chartered airline.</i>

18:09.054 --> 18:11.181
<i>Seventy-five people died in the wreckage.</i>

18:11.356 --> 18:13.085
<i>The football team, the coaches...</i>

<i>...and some prominent residents</i>

18:47.526 --> 18:49.687
<i>These were beautiful young men...</i>

18:49.862 --> 18:55.061
<i>...and it's just a tragedy</i>
<i>that is beyond all comprehension.</i>

19:24.429 --> 19:28.866
<i>No one of us will ever</i>
<i>enter this stadium...</i>

19:29.034 --> 19:32.060

<i>Amen.</i>

20:27.025 --> 20:29.459
<i>Those were not welcome days.</i>

20:30.862 --> 20:32.762
<i>We buried sons...</i>

20:32.965 --> 20:34.626
<i>...brothers...</i>

20:34.800 --> 20:36.267
<i>...mothers...</i>

20:36.435 --> 20:38.528
<i>...fathers...</i>

20:39.304 --> 20:40.794
<i>...fiancés.</i>

20:48.614 --> 20:52.675
<i>Clocks ticked, but time did not pass.</i>

21:00.292 --> 21:03.523
<i>The sun rose and the sun set.</i>

21:05.197 --> 21:07.665
<i>But the shadows remained.</i>

21:11.803 --> 21:13.532
<i>When once there was sound...</i>

21:15.140 --> 21:17.608
<i>...now there was silence.</i>

21:28.320 --> 21:30.220
<i>What once was whole...</i>

21:31.223 --> 21:33.623
<i>...now is shattered.</i>

22:02.187 --> 22:04.849
Have you mentioned this
to any of the other board members?

22:05.023 --> 22:09.016
A few. Most of them
would prefer not to think about it.

22:09.194 --> 22:12.254
l can understand that sentiment.

22:12.431 --> 22:16.128
lt doesn't make sense to rush
right back into it, you know?

22:16.301 --> 22:19.634
Our coaching staff, gone.
Our athletic department, gone.

22:19.805 --> 22:22.968
So many of our boosters, gone.

22:23.141 --> 22:25.666
We'd have to start
all over again from scratch.

22:25.844 --> 22:30.042
My God, we don't have the resources
or the manpower right now.

22:30.215 --> 22:33.184
l know all the reasons
to suspend the program, Paul.

22:33.352 --> 22:35.479
l'm just surprised to hear it
coming from you.

22:35.654 --> 22:37.815
This town just didn't lose
a football team, Don.

22:37.989 --> 22:41.618
We lost doctors, lawyers,
city councilmen.

22:41.793 --> 22:44.284
We lost fathers, sons, husbands.

22:44.463 --> 22:49.457
How many kids lost a parent?
How many kids lost both parents?

22:49.634 --> 22:53.297
-Twenty-eight.
-Wouldn't be a game anymore, Don.

22:54.072 --> 22:56.768
Be a weekly reminder of what we've lost.

22:57.943 --> 23:02.209
And l just don't see how that would
do anyone in this town any good.

23:03.548 --> 23:06.711
Somebody's going to
have to tell them, Paul.

23:09.054 --> 23:12.114
All your scholarships will still be honored.

23:12.824 --> 23:17.557
Boys, it's very important that
we take a collective breath, as a town...

23:17.729 --> 23:20.289
...and figure out the
proper course of action.

23:20.465 --> 23:23.662
And you think the proper course of action
is ending the program?

23:23.835 --> 23:28.238
l didn't say we were going to end the
program, l said we are going to suspend it.

23:28.807 --> 23:33.835
Look, under the best of circumstances,
it takes years to build a team...

23:34.679 --> 23:37.614
...and, well, these are not
the best of circumstances.

23:37.783 --> 23:40.616
The NCAA will not let freshmen play...

23:40.786 --> 23:44.244
...and they are the only players
we have besides you.

23:45.257 --> 23:49.284
When we do bring the program back, we
want to make sure we're able to do it right.

23:49.461 --> 23:52.294
lf. That's what you mean, right?

23:52.464 --> 23:54.329
lf they bring the program back?

23:58.637 --> 24:01.299
This ain't right, Dr. Dedmon.
lt ain't fair!

24:01.473 --> 24:04.101
l understand your position, son.

24:04.376 --> 24:08.312
l will personally pass on your concerns to
the board before they make their decision.

24:08.480 --> 24:10.345
Why can't l pass on
my concerns myself?

24:11.650 --> 24:15.245
Well, unfortunately, board of governors'
meetings are and always have been...

24:15.420 --> 24:16.648
...closed-door.

24:20.859 --> 24:22.190
Come on!

24:22.360 --> 24:24.225
Everybody up! Let's go. Come on.

24:24.396 --> 24:26.489
Reggie, put down the stick. Come on.

24:26.665 --> 24:28.326
l need y'all to listen.

24:29.267 --> 24:33.397
Now, as of 1 5 minutes ago,
we ain't got football no more.

24:35.273 --> 24:38.436
lf you gonna be Marshall,
you gonna be Marshall right now.

24:39.411 --> 24:41.208
Earn your stripes.

24:44.316 --> 24:47.251
Now, l want the two of you
to go with Randy...

24:47.419 --> 24:50.547
...and get every cheerleader and every girl
you can possibly find...

24:50.722 --> 24:54.419
...and get them here at 5:00. The two
of y'all, l need you to go with George...

24:54.593 --> 24:58.085
...and find every cat in them frat houses
and get them here at 5:00.

24:58.263 --> 24:59.924
Go, now, go!

25:00.098 --> 25:01.656
l need you on this one, Reggie.

25:02.467 --> 25:04.332
l need you, man.

25:04.970 --> 25:07.734
Find every person y'all met
in freshman orientation...

25:07.906 --> 25:10.374
...and l need them here at 5:00.

25:10.542 --> 25:13.807
All right? Come on! Now! Come on!

25:14.246 --> 25:16.009
-Five o'clock!
-Nate.

25:16.181 --> 25:18.240
-Yeah.
-Come here a sec.

25:19.551 --> 25:22.611
Hey, l heard that some
of the guys are wavering.

25:23.755 --> 25:26.121
-Wavering?
-Yeah, they're just kind of....

25:26.291 --> 25:30.660
No, no, no. What you mean? What you
talking about? Who's wavering, Tom?

25:31.563 --> 25:35.192
They don't feel it's the right thing to do
right now, step out on that field.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.961
lt's the only thing to do, Tom.

25:38.136 --> 25:40.696
This about our teammates, man.

25:41.172 --> 25:43.970
Now, l need to know
who you talking about.

25:46.511 --> 25:48.240
No one, man.

25:49.781 --> 25:51.681
Five o'clock. All right?

25:53.051 --> 25:55.076
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

25:55.253 --> 25:57.881
-You all right?
-Forget it.

25:58.056 --> 26:00.889
l was just having some thoughts.
l'm ready, man. Let's go.

26:02.127 --> 26:04.425
-We gonna get this team back, man.
-Yeah.

26:08.166 --> 26:11.158
Okay, l think we all know
why we're here today.

26:11.336 --> 26:13.361
What l'd like to do first....

26:19.110 --> 26:23.809
Excuse me, young man.
Excuse me, this is a private meeting.

26:24.316 --> 26:28.810
l don't mean to interrupt, sir, but l think
there's something y'all need to hear.

26:29.254 --> 26:33.850
lf you have anything to say, we'll set up
a time for you to come by my office.

26:34.859 --> 26:38.590
Oh, no, sir. l ain't got nothing to say.

26:42.634 --> 26:44.534
But they do.

27:22.207 --> 27:27.907
<i>We are Marshall! We are Marshall!</i>

27:28.079 --> 27:30.639
<i>We are Marshall!</i>

27:30.815 --> 27:33.511
<i>We are Marshall!</i>

27:33.685 --> 27:36.245
We are Marshall!

27:36.421 --> 27:38.651
<i>We are Marshall!</i>

27:38.823 --> 27:41.189
<i>We are Marshall!</i>

27:41.359 --> 27:44.157
<i>We are Marshall!</i>

27:44.329 --> 27:46.524
<i>We are Marshall!</i>

27:46.698 --> 27:49.223
<i>We are Marshall!</i>

27:49.401 --> 27:52.370
<i>We are Marshall!</i>

27:52.537 --> 27:55.267
We are Marshall!

27:55.440 --> 27:57.670
<i>We are Marshall!</i>

27:57.842 --> 28:00.242
<i>We are Marshall!</i>

28:00.412 --> 28:02.846
<i>We are Marshall!</i>

28:03.014 --> 28:05.778
<i>We are Marshall!</i>

28:05.950 --> 28:08.043
<i>We are Marshall!</i>

28:08.219 --> 28:10.813
<i>We are Marshall!</i>

28:12.090 --> 28:13.614
Paul.

28:14.092 --> 28:16.492
<i>We are Marshall!</i>

28:16.661 --> 28:19.459
<i>We are Marshall!</i>

28:19.631 --> 28:22.429
lt's the right thing to do, sir.

28:26.171 --> 28:32.337
Son, we do not have a team.
We do not have a staff.

28:32.510 --> 28:37.948
We don't even have a damn
athletic director. May he rest in peace.

28:39.617 --> 28:44.179
Frankly, son, l wouldn't know
where to begin.

28:45.290 --> 28:47.758
Well, you can start with a coach, sir.

28:48.927 --> 28:54.559
<i>We are Marshall! We are Marshall!</i>

28:54.733 --> 29:00.467
<i>We are Marshall! We are Marshall!</i>

29:00.638 --> 29:06.235
<i>We are Marshall! We are Marshall!</i>

29:06.411 --> 29:10.074
<i>We are Marshall!</i>

29:16.387 --> 29:17.786
Hey, Mr. Boone.

29:19.190 --> 29:21.351
Annie, honey, come here.

29:23.194 --> 29:25.389
You don't have to come back
to work right away.

29:25.563 --> 29:28.828
Take some time for yourself.
The job will be waiting when you get back.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.764
One thing l don't need
is more time for myself.

29:32.771 --> 29:35.262
l just want things to get back to normal.

29:40.812 --> 29:42.780
Hi, Mr. Griffen.

29:43.648 --> 29:47.209
lt's good to see you.
Glad you're not giving up the booth.

29:47.385 --> 29:51.685
l've been coming here every day
for 30 years. No reason to stop now.

30:09.507 --> 30:11.975
l think you should have this back.

30:14.679 --> 30:16.806
Chris gave it to you.

30:18.149 --> 30:20.174
Yeah, he did.

30:21.619 --> 30:24.247
But you gave it to your wife first.

30:25.657 --> 30:28.626
And then you passed it down to him...

30:28.960 --> 30:31.724
...so l'm passing it back up to you.

30:33.531 --> 30:36.091
lt should stay in your family.

30:38.503 --> 30:40.471
What family?

30:43.641 --> 30:45.108
Annie...

30:46.377 --> 30:48.140
...you keep it.

30:48.546 --> 30:52.846
Wear it. And every morning
you put it on, you think of him.

31:27.886 --> 31:30.878
-Don.
-Red.

31:33.358 --> 31:34.723
What are you working on there?

31:34.893 --> 31:39.057
Well, l been promising Carole
a new shed for a while now, so....

31:39.230 --> 31:41.664
No time like the present, l guess.

31:43.768 --> 31:45.565
Red, l've got an offer for you.

31:51.075 --> 31:53.305
l was afraid you might.

32:02.587 --> 32:05.420
<i>Mrs. Dawson, if it had been me...</i>

32:05.590 --> 32:09.117
...l don't even know how l'd make it out
of bed in the morning.

32:11.562 --> 32:14.190
Let him build a hundred sheds.

32:18.703 --> 32:21.604
<i>Hello, this is President Donald Dedmon.</i>

32:22.774 --> 32:27.370
We've decided to go ahead
with our football program next season...

32:27.545 --> 32:32.141
...and your name was the first
on a list of potential candidates...

32:32.317 --> 32:36.276
...for the head coaching position.

32:37.989 --> 32:41.186
Well, no, l completely
understand. l just....

32:41.359 --> 32:44.123
You were the first one
on my list, so l....

32:49.434 --> 32:53.564
No. No, we decided
to bring the program back.

32:54.138 --> 32:57.164
Yes, it wasn't an easy decision.

32:57.342 --> 33:00.971
No, that's totally understandable. l....

33:04.515 --> 33:07.348
Well, thank you very much for...

33:07.518 --> 33:11.010
...well, taking the time
to at least talk with me about it.

33:14.625 --> 33:19.255
As l've been told,
you had a great career at Marshall and....

33:25.570 --> 33:27.162
Yes, thank you.

33:29.774 --> 33:31.833
No, l understand.

33:32.643 --> 33:34.338
No, l....

33:34.545 --> 33:36.536
Please, it's....

33:41.886 --> 33:43.547
Hey, honey?

33:44.622 --> 33:46.214
You ever been to Huntington before?

33:46.391 --> 33:49.554
Mouth closed, Peter. Thank you.

33:49.727 --> 33:51.217
West Virginia?

33:51.396 --> 33:52.795
No.

33:53.164 --> 33:54.631
Why?

33:55.299 --> 33:57.028
Just curious.

33:57.435 --> 34:00.199
-Hey, Peter.
-Yeah?

34:04.542 --> 34:07.010
Been quieter than l would've
guessed this morning.

34:07.578 --> 34:10.012
Ernie Salvatore called from the <i>Herald.</i>

34:10.181 --> 34:12.741
Says he wants to talk
if you have a moment.

34:12.917 --> 34:14.908
Oh, and there was another call.

34:15.085 --> 34:19.250
A Jack Lengyel called
from the College of Wooster.

34:19.424 --> 34:23.793
Says he may be interested
in the open coaching job.

34:24.228 --> 34:25.820
Wooster.

34:25.996 --> 34:27.987
Where in the world is Wooster?

34:28.266 --> 34:30.893
Does it really matter?

34:36.808 --> 34:39.333
Okay, now, let's show Dr. Dedmon
how it's done here.

34:39.510 --> 34:43.969
Run hard, knees high. Play till
the whistle blows. 1 7-Razor, on three.

34:44.148 --> 34:47.447
On three, 1 7-Razor.
Hut, hut, hut. Go, go, go!

34:47.618 --> 34:51.987
There he goes. There he goes.
Oh, first down!

34:53.056 --> 34:54.956
-You see that? Oh, yeah.
-ls he all right?

34:55.126 --> 34:58.186
Hey, 32, are you all right?
All right, go kill your brother.

34:58.362 --> 35:01.388
Now, you see that? Point is,
that tree wouldn't have been there...

35:01.566 --> 35:03.534
...if you had a fullback blocking for him.

35:03.701 --> 35:06.465
And that is why l'm a fan
of the Power l Formation.

35:06.637 --> 35:12.371
Well, l'm sorry, l'm afraid l haven't the
faintest idea what a Power l Formation is.

35:12.543 --> 35:14.238
Oh, you don't?
Oh, thank you, dear.

35:14.412 --> 35:16.403
-You're welcome.
-Power l Formation...

35:16.581 --> 35:20.847
...is just your basic offensive scheme.
Put the fullback in front of the tailback.

35:21.018 --> 35:24.181
Now, frankly, Jack, l don't care to know.

35:24.522 --> 35:30.154
Actually, l'm confident that l'm better off
not knowing what one is, l think.

35:30.862 --> 35:36.129
Well, Dr. Dedmon, on that,
we will have to agree to disagree.

35:36.501 --> 35:37.900
Thank you.

35:40.371 --> 35:44.068
Jack, there is one thing l need to know...

35:44.342 --> 35:46.708
...and please excuse me if l seem blunt.

35:47.879 --> 35:52.441
You are the first person l've interviewed
who is not an alumnus.

35:52.984 --> 35:56.112
And, well, since you called us...

35:56.521 --> 36:00.150
...l have to ask what your angle is, Jack.

36:01.125 --> 36:05.653
You've got a great setup here.
You have no ties to Marshall.

36:06.063 --> 36:08.531
Why do you want this job?

36:08.699 --> 36:11.293
Who in their right mind
would volunteer for something...?

36:11.469 --> 36:14.529
Son, don't put that in your mouth.
No, put it down. That's right.

36:14.705 --> 36:18.163
-lt's not an outrageous question, l think.
-What's he gonna do?

36:18.342 --> 36:21.277
He's gonna put it in his pants?
l bet he puts it in his pants.

36:21.445 --> 36:25.006
-Son, don't put that in your pant-- Sandy!
-l got it. Peter.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.548
l'm sorry, excuse me.

36:26.717 --> 36:31.950
Well, l was just wondering if you had
given this any thought at all...

36:32.123 --> 36:34.990
...before you asked me to drive 200 miles
out here to see you.

36:36.360 --> 36:38.055
A little bit, yeah.

36:38.529 --> 36:40.121
Little bit.

36:45.703 --> 36:47.295
Well, all right, then.

36:47.872 --> 36:50.670
l have a long ride home...

36:50.841 --> 36:53.503
...and l should be getting on with it.

36:53.678 --> 36:56.374
You thank your wife for the lovely dinner.

36:56.547 --> 36:58.708
-Are you sure? Okay.
-Yes, thank--

36:58.883 --> 37:00.350
Thank you.

37:03.554 --> 37:05.215
Say, Don?

37:08.025 --> 37:10.585
You wanna know why
l picked up the phone? ls that it?

37:10.761 --> 37:12.991
Frankly, l do.

37:13.698 --> 37:17.725
-lt's not gonna be complicated.
-Jack, l've had four months of complicated.

37:17.902 --> 37:19.494
l just need honest.

37:33.084 --> 37:37.748
When l heard about
what had happened, your situation...

37:39.290 --> 37:43.750
...the only thing l could think about
was the four of them.

37:46.597 --> 37:49.498
l thought about how much
they mean to me...

37:51.135 --> 37:53.603
...and about how bad it would hurt if....

37:55.506 --> 37:57.599
Well, if l was to lose them.

38:00.911 --> 38:04.278
Then l thought about a team...

38:06.417 --> 38:08.146
...and a school...

38:09.420 --> 38:11.411
...and a town...

38:12.757 --> 38:14.486
...that's gotta be hurting real bad.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.195
And l thought, hell...

38:19.997 --> 38:21.828
...maybe l can help.

38:27.938 --> 38:29.906
So l called you.

38:34.512 --> 38:35.945
Yeah.

38:37.948 --> 38:41.406
l guess that's the only real ''why'' l got.
Right there.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.049
Touchdown.

38:49.727 --> 38:51.160
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

38:51.329 --> 38:55.857
...please welcome the new head coach
of our Thundering Herd...

38:56.033 --> 38:57.728
...Jack Lengyel.

39:05.810 --> 39:07.402
Hi there.

39:16.821 --> 39:18.516
Thank you.

39:22.159 --> 39:28.655
l am honored to be the new head
football coach here at Marshall University.

39:29.767 --> 39:35.364
Also would like to say a big thank you
from myself, my wife and our three kids.

39:35.539 --> 39:39.305
We drove in from Wooster last night.
Arrived at our new home here.

39:39.477 --> 39:42.844
Electricity worked,
the water pressure was high.

39:43.013 --> 39:46.710
There was a six-pack of beer in the fridge
and a pound cake on the counter.

39:47.418 --> 39:50.478
Four for four.
We appreciate the hospitality, we really do.

39:53.457 --> 39:55.049
Any questions?

39:56.761 --> 39:57.989
-Coach?
-Yes, sir.

39:58.162 --> 40:00.221
Ernie Salvatore, <i>Herald-Dispatch.</i>

40:00.398 --> 40:03.595
Now, realistically, coach,
what are your expectations for the season?

40:05.136 --> 40:07.536
Well, l can tell you this...

40:08.272 --> 40:10.740
...if it's a miracle you're looking for...

40:11.876 --> 40:15.539
...well, you should keep looking, because
you're gonna end up disappointed...

40:15.713 --> 40:17.704
...and l'm gonna end up out of a job.

40:17.915 --> 40:21.146
Follow-up, coach. Follow-up.
One quick follow-up, coach.

40:21.318 --> 40:24.082
What would you say to
the family members in the community...

40:24.255 --> 40:29.454
...who feel that putting the team back
on that field might be disrespectful?

40:36.300 --> 40:38.165
l am a football coach.

40:38.636 --> 40:42.367
That is what l do
and that's why l'm here.

40:44.208 --> 40:45.641
l guess that's it.

40:45.810 --> 40:47.835
l have no idea.
What kind of answer was that?

40:48.012 --> 40:49.138
How many clichés...?

40:49.480 --> 40:52.449
Are there any other questions?

40:52.817 --> 40:54.409
This guy won't make it.

40:56.821 --> 40:58.982
So this is my varsity team, huh?

41:00.124 --> 41:01.682
There was four of us...

41:04.128 --> 41:07.962
...but one of us ain't here,
so l guess it's just three.

41:08.499 --> 41:09.830
Okay.

41:11.035 --> 41:13.765
l'm Coach Jack Lengyel, guys.

41:14.071 --> 41:16.471
Normally, l'm bad with names,
so the good news is...

41:16.640 --> 41:19.507
...l may actually be able
to keep you fellas straight.

41:20.044 --> 41:21.944
Nate, is it?

41:22.112 --> 41:25.377
Okay, now, hold on
while l commit this to memory. Nate.

41:25.850 --> 41:27.841
As in Nate the Great.

41:28.018 --> 41:30.748
Date, late, escape. Wait. Nate.

41:30.921 --> 41:32.684
McDrake.

41:32.857 --> 41:37.191
l got it. Locked.
Kid l went to grade school with.

41:37.361 --> 41:40.853
See, that's a little word-association trick
l learned. Helps jog the recall.

41:41.031 --> 41:44.228
l read about it in <i>Redbook.</i>
And l tell you what, it really works, too.

41:45.469 --> 41:48.029
Well, we're in this together now, boys.

41:49.173 --> 41:51.971
l'm not going anywhere,
and that's a promise.

41:52.810 --> 41:54.072
Already got one name down.

41:55.212 --> 41:57.612
Soon as the wife gets things
settled at the house...

41:57.781 --> 42:01.217
...y'all are coming over for supper,
and l'll get the other two.

42:03.020 --> 42:05.181
We are Marshall.

42:07.992 --> 42:09.857
lt's a new day, men.

42:11.896 --> 42:14.729
l like those boys, Don. l do. l do.

42:14.899 --> 42:17.367
The thing is, l'm gonna need
55 more just like them.

42:17.535 --> 42:20.504
Oh, that l can't help you with, l'm afraid.

42:20.738 --> 42:22.831
Well, actually, you can, Don.

42:23.941 --> 42:28.537
You see, l need you to petition
the NCAA for me.

42:28.712 --> 42:33.342
Ask them to make an exception.
Allow us to play freshmen.

42:33.517 --> 42:36.577
Now, it's the only chance we have
to get any edge on recruiting...

42:36.754 --> 42:39.450
...much less put a full football team
on the field.

42:39.623 --> 42:41.853
l mean, we are way behind here.

42:42.026 --> 42:46.190
Well, you know the NCAA
better than l do, Jack.

42:46.363 --> 42:50.094
They're rigid as a board.
They don't make exceptions.

42:51.468 --> 42:52.935
Usually true.

42:53.771 --> 42:55.102
Yeah.

42:56.473 --> 43:01.410
Hey, you know, my son, he crapped
his pants yesterday. Now, he's 4.

43:01.579 --> 43:04.946
All right, now, my wife is out shopping,
so l had to clean him up.

43:05.783 --> 43:08.217
She got home. l told her what happened.
She says, ''l can't believe it.''

43:08.385 --> 43:11.149
l said, ''l can't believe it either.
The kid's 4 years old...

43:11.322 --> 43:13.586
...he shouldn't be doing that shit.''
Pun intended.

43:13.757 --> 43:16.555
You know what she says to me?
She says, ''Jack, no, not that.

43:17.161 --> 43:20.597
l can't believe you finally
changed a diaper.''

43:22.466 --> 43:24.491
What are you talking about?

43:25.302 --> 43:27.600
There's a first time for everything.

43:31.342 --> 43:32.741
Hey, l know you.

43:32.910 --> 43:35.208
ln the middle. Yes, l do.

43:35.379 --> 43:39.110
Ask me your name. Go ahead,
l won't even look. Ask me your name.

43:40.150 --> 43:43.347
-What's my name?
-Nate Ruffin.

43:43.520 --> 43:47.115
Team co-captain. Eleven interceptions
in only seven games last year.

43:49.927 --> 43:51.485
<i>Redbook.</i>

43:51.996 --> 43:53.486
Stuff really works.

43:53.664 --> 43:55.825
Hey, we can do this, doc.

44:02.873 --> 44:06.468
What are those, 1 -by-5s?

44:06.644 --> 44:07.872
One-by-sixes.

44:09.580 --> 44:12.413
They don't look that wide from down here.

44:15.619 --> 44:19.020
-Saw you guys play once.
-Did we win?

44:19.957 --> 44:21.982
lt was the Ashland game.

44:22.292 --> 44:23.691
Well, that'd be a no, then.

44:24.862 --> 44:27.990
Well, you guys looked pretty good
till the fourth quarter.

44:29.133 --> 44:31.397
Probably should've gone to the nickel.

44:33.370 --> 44:35.497
You know, you're probably right.

44:35.673 --> 44:38.198
You know, l appreciate you
coming out here to see me...

44:38.375 --> 44:42.971
...but they already came out here to ask me
back and l already told them that l'm not...

44:44.481 --> 44:47.575
-...coming back, so....
-Yeah, l heard. l heard about that.

44:49.319 --> 44:53.085
Just thought l could make you
a better offer.

44:53.557 --> 44:56.321
You know, they asked you
to be the head coach.

44:57.227 --> 44:59.161
l want you to be the assistant coach.

45:01.198 --> 45:03.257
l think that's a demotion, Jack.

45:03.434 --> 45:04.958
Well, maybe.

45:05.402 --> 45:06.869
Maybe not.

45:07.037 --> 45:11.235
l mean, it's the same duties,
practically, just less pay.

45:12.543 --> 45:15.706
Same hours. Less responsibility.

45:15.879 --> 45:18.006
Same team, less pressure.

45:19.383 --> 45:24.252
l tell you, Red, you know,
the cupboard is pretty bare.

45:24.421 --> 45:28.551
And l could use some recruiting help
from someone who knows the area.

45:35.432 --> 45:38.458
You know, Carole and l
moved here two years ago. lt was...

45:39.937 --> 45:41.905
...spring of '69.

45:44.208 --> 45:46.108
They had hired me as a receivers coach...

45:46.276 --> 45:50.076
...but when l got here, they told me
l was in charge of recruiting too, so....

45:50.981 --> 45:55.611
That first year l went out
and l got us 20 kids.

45:56.253 --> 46:00.917
Went to 20 homes.
Sat in 20 living rooms.

46:02.159 --> 46:05.890
And l promised 20 mothers
that l'd look after their sons.

46:07.898 --> 46:10.423
lt'd have been the class of '73.

46:14.638 --> 46:16.936
There's not one of them left.

46:20.944 --> 46:23.071
So let me ask you, Jack:

46:24.481 --> 46:28.975
How am l supposed to look a mother in the
eye and promise her anything ever again?

46:35.292 --> 46:37.317
l don't know, Red.

46:45.335 --> 46:48.600
l just don't think l could
take that field again, Jack.

47:00.617 --> 47:04.053
ls that the Ohio Valley Coal line?

47:04.221 --> 47:07.122
The same one that went off the tracks
near Akron last winter?

47:07.291 --> 47:10.317
Yep. That's the one.

47:11.195 --> 47:13.095
Back on track.

47:18.502 --> 47:22.029
Well, listen,
if you're able to figure it out...

47:22.206 --> 47:24.970
...door's always open.
lt was a pleasure meeting you, Red.

47:25.142 --> 47:27.110
Nice meeting you.

47:27.277 --> 47:31.145
l'll keep that defensive-nickel
package idea in mind...

47:31.315 --> 47:35.513
...for my fourth quarters in the future.
Maybe get a few more W's.

47:37.321 --> 47:38.913
One-by-six, huh?

47:39.089 --> 47:40.317
Yup.

47:40.490 --> 47:43.857
Same coverage, less boards.

47:48.065 --> 47:49.396
Hey, Tom.

47:52.069 --> 47:54.094
Guess we got us a coach, huh?

48:03.347 --> 48:04.871
Hey, look.

48:06.283 --> 48:10.686
When they first roomed us together
freshman year, l wasn't too sure about you.

48:11.855 --> 48:15.951
You know? But we stuck it out,
and now you're my best friend.

48:17.261 --> 48:19.627
l mean, remember freshman two-a-days?

48:19.796 --> 48:23.698
l'm puking my guts out and
l wanna quit football and you won't let me?

48:25.135 --> 48:27.729
Now, you never gave up on us
out there on the field...

48:27.905 --> 48:30.396
...and l'm not gonna give up on you now.

48:34.378 --> 48:36.039
Tom, man.

48:36.213 --> 48:41.947
lt's our team. Now, they left this to us.
lt's up to us! lt's on our shoulders, man.

48:43.487 --> 48:45.785
l need you with me, Tom.

48:45.956 --> 48:48.220
l should've been with them, Nate.

48:48.392 --> 48:52.590
-Look, Tom, l understand, and l feel--
-No, you don't! You don't, Nate! You don't.

48:54.898 --> 48:57.162
What you talking about?

48:59.369 --> 49:01.337
l overslept.

49:02.239 --> 49:05.265
That's why l wasn't on the plane, Nate.
l overslept.

49:05.943 --> 49:08.810
l wasn't hurt or sick.
And l should've been there.

49:08.979 --> 49:11.004
l should have been with them!

49:12.783 --> 49:16.844
l'm sorry. l just can't play football
right now. Okay? lt's not in me.

49:19.389 --> 49:22.586
l can't do it, you understand that, right?
Look at me.

49:25.362 --> 49:26.989
l'm sorry.

49:27.364 --> 49:29.025
Tom.

49:46.950 --> 49:49.316
Thought you might like some dessert.

49:50.787 --> 49:52.687
Thank you, Annie.

49:53.890 --> 49:55.551
l'm gonna get you some silverware.

50:57.821 --> 50:59.311
Yup.

51:00.290 --> 51:01.621
Game day.

51:07.898 --> 51:09.297
Yup.

51:18.442 --> 51:23.607
So l'll give you one year.

51:26.183 --> 51:29.584
Well, if that's all the time we've got,
we'd better get started.

51:42.532 --> 51:44.090
Coach Mickey Jackson.

51:46.736 --> 51:48.533
Coach McNally.

51:52.075 --> 51:53.599
Coach Riley.

51:56.379 --> 52:02.113
First line: NCAA, address--
l assume you have it, Luann.

52:02.285 --> 52:04.412
lt's somewhere in Kansas City.

52:04.588 --> 52:08.524
Salutation: To whom it may concern.

52:09.593 --> 52:12.790
As l am sure you are aware, we....

52:13.763 --> 52:16.231
l'm gonna take a road trip
southeast of here...

52:16.399 --> 52:19.926
...and go get this Shaw kid
down in Martinsville.

52:20.103 --> 52:22.094
l'm gonna take a shot at Gibbs.

52:22.272 --> 52:24.502
Go get us a quarterback, coach.

52:39.322 --> 52:42.291
-Jake. Red Dawson.
-Yes, sir?

52:50.333 --> 52:53.700
l know coaches from quite a few schools
have already come to talk...

52:53.870 --> 52:57.829
...about your son playing football for them.
l hope that he hasn't made his mind up.

52:58.008 --> 52:59.839
Ain't no way he's made up his mind yet.

53:00.810 --> 53:03.005
Wait, there he is, right there.

53:14.357 --> 53:16.484
Oh, what's the good word, coach?

53:19.296 --> 53:21.321
No? Shit.

53:23.533 --> 53:26.366
Truman Andrews. Here we come.

53:50.493 --> 53:52.393
Shit.

53:53.797 --> 53:55.458
Luann?

53:59.135 --> 54:00.363
Sir?

54:00.537 --> 54:03.199
Has the NCAA returned
any of my calls yet?

54:03.373 --> 54:04.772
No.

54:07.277 --> 54:10.246
Six, seven, eight, nine, 1 0,
1 1 at West Virginia.

54:10.413 --> 54:14.873
Kids that we wanted who are now
in West Virginia. Who's that?

54:15.485 --> 54:17.817
Bob Lambert. West Virginia.

54:17.988 --> 54:19.478
Shit.

54:19.656 --> 54:21.089
Twelve. West Virginia.

54:21.258 --> 54:24.421
Red, we gotta broaden our
recruiting base or something.

54:24.594 --> 54:27.927
We gotta get creative about...

54:28.198 --> 54:31.065
...who we're going after,
where we're going after them...

54:31.234 --> 54:34.431
...and how we're going after them.
lsn't that right, doc?

54:36.172 --> 54:37.969
Good morning, Red.

54:39.409 --> 54:42.139
Well, how are we doing?

54:42.312 --> 54:44.337
West Virginia will be
competitive next year.

54:44.514 --> 54:46.880
Yeah, very.
How about you?

54:47.751 --> 54:53.815
Well, Jack, l haven't heard anything
positive back yet.

54:53.990 --> 54:56.481
And l think l've done everything l can.

54:56.793 --> 55:00.126
Maybe we need more time.
l don't know.

55:01.097 --> 55:04.191
Time's the only thing
we don't have, Don.

55:04.367 --> 55:10.829
l mean, hell, it's already April.
Time is not our friend.

55:14.477 --> 55:16.945
Let me ask you a question.
Now, are you married?

55:17.113 --> 55:18.876
Yes, l am. 25 years in May.

55:19.049 --> 55:22.280
Twenty-five years. l am willing to bet...

55:23.320 --> 55:26.585
...that you didn't propose over the phone.

55:29.125 --> 55:30.956
No, l didn't.

55:31.127 --> 55:36.793
Okay. And l know damn well
that she didn't say yes in a letter.

55:39.736 --> 55:41.328
-Jack?
-Doc?

55:41.504 --> 55:44.940
-No, Jack. l know....
-Yes. Doc?

55:45.108 --> 55:46.336
You can do it.

55:48.478 --> 55:50.503
You're an outlaw. Pioneer.

55:51.014 --> 55:54.381
Gunslinger.
This is a whole new game, doc.

55:56.986 --> 55:58.977
You....

55:59.389 --> 56:01.016
You.

56:01.524 --> 56:05.085
There's a first time for everything, Don.

56:06.596 --> 56:09.258
lf we're gonna survive, this has
to be one of those times.

56:09.432 --> 56:11.900
And you're the only man that can do it.

56:22.846 --> 56:28.409
Excuse me, sir? Excuse me,
l'm sorry to bother you like this...

56:29.686 --> 56:33.417
...but my name is Don Dedmon,
l'm president of Marshall University.

56:33.990 --> 56:36.220
May l speak with you
for a moment, please?

56:37.327 --> 56:39.659
What are you doing in Kansas City, Don?

56:40.296 --> 56:44.665
My town, my school, we're hurting.

56:45.135 --> 56:50.129
We want to play football,
and we cannot do it without your help.

56:54.978 --> 56:56.536
Please.

57:16.433 --> 57:18.594
Guess who's going to change our diaper.

57:21.337 --> 57:24.431
Yeah!

57:24.607 --> 57:26.074
Get him!

57:26.242 --> 57:28.904
Need a little help here, Red.
He's heavier than you think.

57:29.078 --> 57:31.569
He's all wet.
He's all wet.

57:32.582 --> 57:34.072
Approved.

57:34.250 --> 57:38.243
''You will be allowed to play freshmen
at Marshall University.''

57:38.421 --> 57:41.117
-What's that right there? What's that?
-Here, put me down.

57:41.291 --> 57:44.590
That is signed by the president right there.
There he is. Stamped.

57:44.761 --> 57:47.286
Doc, we're gonna get us a football team.

57:48.364 --> 57:51.128
And that is why we are offering
your son something...

57:51.301 --> 57:53.701
...that no other school in the country can.

57:53.970 --> 57:58.839
lmmediate and substantial playing time
as a freshman.

58:14.157 --> 58:16.990
Time! l like the kid
who made the lay-up.

58:17.160 --> 58:20.618
This is the one l wanna talk to, right here.
What's your name, son?

58:25.235 --> 58:27.226
Ball, ball, ball!

58:32.008 --> 58:33.908
-That was a hell of a hit.
-Thank you.

58:34.077 --> 58:36.477
-Coach Dawson, from the football club.
-Bobby Jordan.

58:36.646 --> 58:38.910
-Ever play any football? None at all?
-No, sir.

58:39.082 --> 58:42.108
-No Pop Warner, no high school?
-No. Just baseball.

58:46.923 --> 58:48.857
Groovy. Come on, man.

58:49.259 --> 58:50.692
Hey, let me rap to you.

58:59.769 --> 59:01.327
Hey, how you doing?

59:03.973 --> 59:06.771
Hey. What's up, man?

59:20.623 --> 59:24.491
Strong finish.
That's a good-looking board.

59:25.795 --> 59:29.697
Good-looking board.
l'm tired of flying.

59:32.368 --> 59:37.305
Marshall Thundering Herd all-freshmen
team, led by quarterback John Cady...

59:38.975 --> 59:43.776
...handing the ball off
to the ever-talented Lucas Booth!

59:43.947 --> 59:46.677
He runs to the inside,
and who's on the outsider wing?

59:46.849 --> 59:49.647
Terry Gardner catches it,
pitches to Tennis Rice...

59:49.819 --> 59:53.311
...who's going downfield to
tight end Sam Boteck.

01:00:19.749 --> 01:00:20.977
l've never been.

01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:22.674
-Crazy. ln four years?
-Yeah.

01:00:22.852 --> 01:00:24.217
-The bonfire.
-l've never been.

01:00:24.387 --> 01:00:26.378
-Everyone's been to the bonfire.
-l haven't.

01:00:26.556 --> 01:00:28.888
-Do you eat marshmallows?
-l love marshmallows.

01:00:29.058 --> 01:00:32.824
-You've gotta come to the bonfire.
-Annie, order's up.

01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:36.160
-Ask her to come.
-l will, l will.

01:00:40.536 --> 01:00:42.470
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

01:00:43.539 --> 01:00:46.838
-Can we have some silverware?
-Sure.

01:00:52.482 --> 01:00:55.076
-Some guys have all the luck.
-Sorry?

01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:57.845
Your fiancé. He's a lucky guy.

01:00:59.922 --> 01:01:03.824
-Can you drive? Yeah.
-Yeah. We'll leave about 8?

01:01:12.468 --> 01:01:15.835
Keith? lt's your turn
to set the table!

01:01:16.005 --> 01:01:17.734
He's not here, Mom.

01:01:18.274 --> 01:01:20.572
-Where is he?
-l don't know.

01:01:22.412 --> 01:01:24.573
Okay, guys. First things first.

01:01:24.747 --> 01:01:26.977
Feel a connection to the guy next to you.

01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:30.119
Hand on a knee, hook an arm,
whatever it is.

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.147
Come on, Herd.

01:01:32.321 --> 01:01:34.915
Look around, because these
are your teammates, young men.

01:01:35.091 --> 01:01:38.083
They're made up of three
returning varsity members.

01:01:38.261 --> 01:01:41.890
Randy Linden, George Olson, Nate Ruffin.

01:01:42.065 --> 01:01:46.058
Fifteen freshmen turning sophomores.

01:01:46.235 --> 01:01:48.829
And the rest of you, true freshmen...

01:01:49.005 --> 01:01:52.634
...very first time in college football
and walk-ons.

01:01:52.809 --> 01:01:55.175
Are you gonna play too, Tom?

01:01:56.379 --> 01:01:59.974
Remember, this is a game called football,
let's get to work. Let's go.

01:02:12.061 --> 01:02:14.461
We are going to be running
the Power l, gentlemen...

01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:16.723
...which obviously starts
with a quarterback.

01:02:16.899 --> 01:02:19.732
-Red, what are my choices?
-Dave Walsh.

01:02:19.902 --> 01:02:22.735
Solid athlete. Solid arm. Solid kid.

01:02:22.905 --> 01:02:24.372
Okay.

01:02:25.108 --> 01:02:26.632
Who else?

01:02:26.809 --> 01:02:31.405
-Jack, that's it.
-That's it, 1 0?

01:02:31.581 --> 01:02:32.809
That's it, coach.

01:02:32.982 --> 01:02:35.212
All right, guys.
Competition breeds improvement.

01:02:35.384 --> 01:02:39.081
Now, we need options here.
Let's look around, keep our eyes open.

01:02:39.255 --> 01:02:43.419
We need legs, hands and a decent arm.
Right there. Who's 86?

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:47.259
That's Reggie Oliver.
Receiver from Alabama.

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:50.228
Bear Bryant called me personally,
actually, to recommend him.

01:02:50.399 --> 01:02:53.664
-You wanna try him out at QB?
-Unless you think it's a bad idea.

01:02:54.036 --> 01:02:57.005
-Let's push them to the limit, men, huh?
-Right, coach.

01:03:03.579 --> 01:03:05.513
Come on, hit it, now!

01:03:07.116 --> 01:03:08.447
Check!

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:18.286
Not good, coach.

01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:35.470
James, James. Get over here.

01:03:37.513 --> 01:03:39.174
That's supposed to be a post route.

01:03:39.348 --> 01:03:41.111
-Post?
-Post.

01:03:41.284 --> 01:03:44.310
You do know the difference between a
post route and a flag route?

01:03:44.487 --> 01:03:45.715
No, coach.

01:03:45.888 --> 01:03:49.346
All right, all right.
You see the big goalpost there?

01:03:49.525 --> 01:03:53.256
That's why they call it a post route. Post.
You head right to that post.

01:03:53.429 --> 01:03:55.124
Cut 1 0 yards, to the post.

01:03:55.298 --> 01:03:57.766
See the big pylon down
at the corner of the end zone?

01:03:57.934 --> 01:03:59.697
That's what we call a flag, all right?

01:03:59.869 --> 01:04:01.734
So when you're running the flag route...

01:04:01.904 --> 01:04:04.429
...1 0 yards to the corner of the end zone,
to the flag.

01:04:04.607 --> 01:04:06.438
-All right? All right.
-l got it.

01:04:06.609 --> 01:04:08.304
Do it again.

01:04:18.855 --> 01:04:21.255
Come on! Let's go!

01:04:21.791 --> 01:04:24.453
Nice speed, Booth! Nice speed!

01:04:26.128 --> 01:04:28.596
Nice speed. Shalhoop. Hey.

01:04:28.764 --> 01:04:31.824
-What are you doing?
-Oh, l kick the ball, coach.

01:04:32.001 --> 01:04:34.799
But after you kick it, son,
you're still a football player.

01:04:41.377 --> 01:04:44.039
Good job, George. Good job, George.
Come here, come here.

01:04:44.213 --> 01:04:46.078
-What's your name, 51 ?
-My name's Creole.

01:04:46.249 --> 01:04:48.274
Creole. This <i>Redbook</i>'s
taking me only so far.

01:04:48.451 --> 01:04:52.478
Urbanek, l need names. Last names on
everyone's helmet. All right? This afternoon.

01:04:52.655 --> 01:04:56.614
Now, Creole, the man outweighs you
by 75 pounds. Okay?

01:04:56.792 --> 01:04:58.384
When you're hitting him up high...

01:04:58.561 --> 01:05:01.587
...he'll beat you and you'll be
on your ass every time, all right?

01:05:01.764 --> 01:05:03.925
You gotta come in here,
you gotta get him low.

01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:07.558
Get him in the legs, okay? That's how
you'll keep him from coming through.

01:05:07.737 --> 01:05:10.535
-Stay low on him. Low, man.
-What should l do if he goes low?

01:05:10.706 --> 01:05:13.368
Good question. George says,
what does he do if he goes low?

01:05:13.542 --> 01:05:15.942
Five-one comes low.
Head slap and you're around him.

01:05:16.112 --> 01:05:18.774
Like that. You see that?
Head-slap the shit out of him.

01:05:29.759 --> 01:05:33.820
-Give me second team, McNally.
-We don't have a second team, Jack.

01:05:33.996 --> 01:05:37.762
Shit. Okay, yeah, we do
have a second team. Jackson! Urbanek!

01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:39.925
Lengyel, McNally, Dawson...

01:05:40.102 --> 01:05:42.263
...line up here.
Offensive line, watch this.

01:05:42.438 --> 01:05:45.635
-Coach, you don't have any pads on.
-Now, you just play ball, Olson.

01:05:47.777 --> 01:05:49.142
Quarterback's still standing.

01:05:49.312 --> 01:05:51.439
Big on big.
We can run an offense.

01:05:51.614 --> 01:05:55.846
We can save a young man's life.
Come on, now. Power l. Big on big.

01:06:01.257 --> 01:06:04.192
We got a huge problem
on the O-line, coach.

01:06:05.227 --> 01:06:08.162
l don't think it's because
the defensive line is so spectacular.

01:06:08.331 --> 01:06:09.662
No. No.

01:06:11.133 --> 01:06:15.797
Men. Power l. You know l'm a fan
of it, that's why l brought it here.

01:06:15.972 --> 01:06:18.805
l have learned in the last two weeks
that it is not working.

01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:22.570
So as of right now, the Power l
goes in the trash...

01:06:22.745 --> 01:06:27.079
...along with every flea-flicker,
double reverse...

01:06:27.249 --> 01:06:30.241
...and every other trick play
that you may have in your playbook.

01:06:30.419 --> 01:06:33.820
Get rid of it.
Men, it is time to simplify. Ball.

01:06:34.957 --> 01:06:37.323
So put our heads together here.

01:06:37.493 --> 01:06:39.654
What is the simplest offense...

01:06:41.731 --> 01:06:44.564
...that you have ever run
and actually won a football game?

01:06:44.734 --> 01:06:49.068
Any idea's a good idea. No right or wrong
in here today, men, let's talk it out.

01:06:49.238 --> 01:06:50.603
Well, there's always the Veer.

01:06:50.773 --> 01:06:54.641
The Veer. That's interesting.
Talk that out, Red.

01:06:55.244 --> 01:06:59.305
Well, the Veer's an option offense.
Spreads things out.

01:06:59.482 --> 01:07:01.074
Takes the focus off any one man.

01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:04.185
lt's designed for teams that don't
have a strong offensive line.

01:07:04.653 --> 01:07:08.111
Now, that is us in a nutshell.
Well, who runs it that we can talk to?

01:07:08.290 --> 01:07:10.690
Bill Yeoman came up with it
at Houston...

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:14.193
...but other than West Virginia,
no one really runs it outside of Texas.

01:07:16.298 --> 01:07:18.823
-West Virginia runs the Veer?
-Yeah.

01:07:24.073 --> 01:07:28.442
Jack, that's crazy. We're rivals.

01:07:28.611 --> 01:07:31.705
You think they'll invite us to lunch
and hand over their playbook?

01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:33.781
They don't have to take us out to lunch.

01:07:33.949 --> 01:07:36.008
We'll pick some up on the way.

01:07:36.385 --> 01:07:40.685
Morgantown. The Veer. l like it.

01:07:45.027 --> 01:07:48.258
Eight-time Southern
Conference Champions, Red.

01:07:48.431 --> 01:07:52.697
Jack? Jack, l gotta tell you,
l really don't think this is your best idea.

01:07:53.035 --> 01:07:56.334
-Red! Good to see you again.
-Oh, coach.

01:07:56.505 --> 01:07:58.666
-How are you?
-How are you?

01:07:58.841 --> 01:08:00.900
-And this must be?
-Coach Jack Lengyel.

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:03.477
Jack. Bobby Bowden.
Pleasure to meet you.

01:08:03.646 --> 01:08:05.273
lt's a pleasure to meet you.

01:08:05.448 --> 01:08:07.814
Bobby, thank you for taking
the time with us today.

01:08:07.983 --> 01:08:10.349
-My pleasure, not a problem.
-All right.

01:08:10.519 --> 01:08:12.077
Yes, sir.

01:08:12.588 --> 01:08:15.955
So l can't wait to hear.
What can l do for you boys?

01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:19.524
Well, the thing is...

01:08:20.563 --> 01:08:21.996
...coach...

01:08:22.564 --> 01:08:26.501
...we're thinking about adopting
the Veer this year.

01:08:26.734 --> 01:08:29.795
Now, l understand that to be
your bread and butter, as it were.

01:08:29.971 --> 01:08:32.667
We're just hoping that we could
come down here and maybe...

01:08:32.841 --> 01:08:34.810
...you could give us a few pointers.

01:08:41.850 --> 01:08:43.113
-Pointers?
-Tips.

01:08:43.285 --> 01:08:47.051
Advice. Anything that you'd
be willing to show us.

01:08:47.389 --> 01:08:52.587
Well, we'd really appreciate it. You seem
to be the man who runs it so well.

01:08:55.264 --> 01:08:56.595
He's good.

01:08:59.135 --> 01:09:01.626
-You're the best at the Veer.
-That's what they say!

01:09:01.804 --> 01:09:03.738
l'm coming straight to the man.

01:09:08.410 --> 01:09:10.344
Reg, l got your burger.

01:09:10.513 --> 01:09:13.243
-Chili on the fries?
-They were out.

01:09:13.415 --> 01:09:17.408
Come on, Stretch. Gonna be a rough year
if that's the best you can do.

01:09:28.229 --> 01:09:29.822
What?

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.061
Playbooks. Research. Game film.

01:10:14.237 --> 01:10:17.035
Need anything copied or dubbed,
just see Kitty down the hall.

01:10:17.207 --> 01:10:19.698
Coach, you serious?

01:10:19.876 --> 01:10:23.471
Sure. We don't play y'all this year,
so, what the heck? Have at it.

01:10:23.647 --> 01:10:26.411
Just make sure you put everything back
where you found it.

01:10:26.583 --> 01:10:28.141
Deal.

01:10:28.918 --> 01:10:31.785
You grow them big down in Huntington,
l'm telling you.

01:10:33.423 --> 01:10:37.359
Oh, guys. You get hungry,
there's a lunch spread next door.

01:10:37.527 --> 01:10:39.358
Help yourselves.

01:10:41.398 --> 01:10:44.799
You hungry, Red?
l'm gonna watch some film.

01:11:08.258 --> 01:11:10.920
Let me see those things.

01:11:14.330 --> 01:11:16.594
l'm you. l'm you.

01:11:19.569 --> 01:11:21.036
Well, that's not dumb.

01:11:22.272 --> 01:11:25.833
Their quarterback's gotta
have ice in his veins...

01:11:26.009 --> 01:11:30.070
...but he's gotta still be able to make
decisions until the last possible second.

01:11:39.055 --> 01:11:43.822
Give me that ball!
Give me the ball! He scores! Go, Herd!

01:12:05.081 --> 01:12:08.778
Oh, look at that hit.
Every time he commits.

01:12:09.252 --> 01:12:11.777
He gets the option to get the ball outside.
Hey, guys.

01:12:12.956 --> 01:12:14.890
Sorry. We're looking for coach.

01:12:15.058 --> 01:12:16.389
Not in here today, guys.

01:12:16.559 --> 01:12:18.754
Sorry, coach, we just came
to watch some film.

01:12:23.099 --> 01:12:25.226
You told us to meet with you
after practice.

01:12:28.705 --> 01:12:31.003
-Next one.
-Yes, sir.

01:12:37.981 --> 01:12:40.108
Colors clash a bit, don't they?

01:12:41.851 --> 01:12:43.842
That's first class, coach.

01:12:44.587 --> 01:12:46.248
First class.

01:12:46.422 --> 01:12:48.913
You guys take all the time you need.

01:13:12.215 --> 01:13:16.049
Your offense, 1 2.
Show me how it's done, now.

01:13:17.187 --> 01:13:20.088
Black-1 8! Set! Hut!

01:13:22.592 --> 01:13:24.719
Move! That's it!

01:13:24.894 --> 01:13:28.330
That's it, go! Move! Go! Move!
Go! Move!

01:13:32.769 --> 01:13:36.830
Coach Red Dawson, looks a little something
like the Veer, doesn't it?

01:13:37.006 --> 01:13:39.201
Little bit. Little bit.

01:13:39.375 --> 01:13:40.672
l like it.

01:13:41.945 --> 01:13:44.004
One more time.
Go to your right side.

01:13:44.647 --> 01:13:46.114
They don't look half-bad, coach.

01:13:46.282 --> 01:13:48.978
Don't look half-bad left or right, Ernie.
Did you see that?

01:13:49.152 --> 01:13:51.712
l did. l was playing around
with the numbers last night.

01:13:51.888 --> 01:13:55.119
You know the average age of a starter
in college football these days?

01:13:55.291 --> 01:13:57.851
-No idea. Go!
-20 years, 1 0 months.

01:13:58.027 --> 01:14:00.325
Now, you know the average age
of your players?

01:14:00.496 --> 01:14:03.795
-No.
-1 8 years, seven months.

01:14:05.501 --> 01:14:10.438
That'd be us, Ernie.
The Young Thundering Herd. l like it.

01:14:10.607 --> 01:14:12.768
Oh, l like that.
Do you mind if l use that?

01:14:12.942 --> 01:14:14.910
Hell, no. l'm already making T-shirts.

01:14:16.613 --> 01:14:18.740
What you think about this?

01:14:18.915 --> 01:14:21.509
''The Young Thundering Herd.''

01:14:22.118 --> 01:14:24.916
l like it, George!
Can you get me one of those?

01:14:31.728 --> 01:14:33.252
We've practiced.

01:14:38.001 --> 01:14:39.559
We have a plan.

01:14:43.373 --> 01:14:44.670
And now it's game day.

01:14:47.911 --> 01:14:50.345
Nate Ruffin,
are you the captain of this team?

01:14:50.513 --> 01:14:51.810
Yes, sir, l am, coach!

01:14:52.415 --> 01:14:55.077
Well, why don't you take us
onto that field?

01:14:56.653 --> 01:14:58.848
Everybody up! Come in here!

01:14:59.656 --> 01:15:04.355
Now, 60 minutes! We play till the whistle
blow! And you know how we do.

01:15:04.527 --> 01:15:06.051
-We are?
-Marshall!

01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:08.629
-Now, let's take it to the field!
-Yeah!

01:15:13.403 --> 01:15:16.668
<i>And here they come,</i>
<i>the Young Thundering Herd of Marshall!</i>

01:15:25.348 --> 01:15:27.714
Jack! Jack!

01:15:29.953 --> 01:15:31.420
Game day.

01:15:36.693 --> 01:15:39.685
<i>Welcome to Morehead, Kentucky,</i>
<i>where the Morehead State Eagles...</i>

01:15:39.862 --> 01:15:43.730
<i>...take on the Thundering Herd of Marshall</i>
<i>University in their 1 97 1 season opener.</i>

01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:47.267
<i>The Marshall Thundering Herd</i>
<i>was marked by tragedy last season...</i>

01:15:47.437 --> 01:15:50.463
<i>...but they are back in the saddle</i>
<i>with a new coach, a new team...</i>

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:54.201
<i>...and for the first time in NCAA history,</i>
<i>true freshmen in their lineup.</i>

01:15:54.377 --> 01:15:58.746
<i>And now, ladies and gentlemen, the</i>
<i>Morehead State Eagles are taking the field.</i>

01:16:04.354 --> 01:16:06.117
-How you feeling?
-Feeling good, coach.

01:16:06.289 --> 01:16:07.756
Feeling good.

01:16:11.794 --> 01:16:14.786
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go!

01:16:39.756 --> 01:16:40.745
Oh, no.

01:16:48.965 --> 01:16:53.425
That's a clip! Where's the clip on that?
That's a clip, ref!

01:17:06.315 --> 01:17:08.306
lt's all right. lt's all right.

01:17:11.154 --> 01:17:13.520
They hit him low. All right?

01:17:14.924 --> 01:17:16.983
They hit him low. All right?

01:17:18.161 --> 01:17:20.925
l'm all right. l'm all right.

01:17:21.097 --> 01:17:23.088
<i>We hope he didn't re-injure his shoulder...</i>

01:17:23.266 --> 01:17:25.928
<i>...but I could hear the hit</i>
<i>from up here in the press box.</i>

01:17:26.102 --> 01:17:28.468
<i>Number 25, Nate Ruffin,</i>
<i>got blindsided and....</i>

01:17:31.407 --> 01:17:32.931
<i>--could not stop the return man.</i>

01:17:33.109 --> 01:17:36.806
<i>And now, with the extra point,</i>
<i>Morehead State is leading 29-6.</i>

01:17:36.979 --> 01:17:39.573
<i>The Marshall faithful</i>
<i>cannot be happy now.</i>

01:17:41.317 --> 01:17:43.945
Oliver! Oliver! Strong right!

01:17:45.655 --> 01:17:48.283
Switch! Switch!

01:17:49.192 --> 01:17:52.059
Forty! Set! Hike!

01:18:01.571 --> 01:18:02.799
Damn it.

01:18:04.874 --> 01:18:06.865
That's a shame.

01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:13.071
Gotta look him off.
lf you look him off....

01:18:13.249 --> 01:18:16.309
And you don't have to throw it.
You had 20 yards in front of you.

01:18:16.486 --> 01:18:18.044
Hut!

01:18:22.191 --> 01:18:24.591
-Ball! Ball!
-Get on the ball!

01:18:29.699 --> 01:18:31.860
That ain't a pitch,
you gotta get me the ball.

01:18:32.034 --> 01:18:34.867
-lf l make the pitch, catch the ball.
-You gotta get it to me.

01:18:35.037 --> 01:18:38.438
We gotta shake it up here.
We gotta start blitzing our linebacker.

01:18:55.324 --> 01:18:59.556
<i>That's a hard hit on number 29. Twenty-nine</i>
<i>is down and he's not getting up.</i>

01:18:59.729 --> 01:19:02.596
<i>I don't see number 29 on my roster here.</i>

01:19:02.765 --> 01:19:06.462
<i>There's just so many new faces on this</i>
<i>Marshall University Thundering Herd team.</i>

01:19:06.802 --> 01:19:09.032
Can you shake it off or not?

01:19:09.539 --> 01:19:12.030
Dawson! Dawson!

01:19:14.944 --> 01:19:17.276
What do you think?
We gotta get three points.

01:19:17.446 --> 01:19:20.108
We don't get any points on the board,
we'll lose them.

01:19:20.283 --> 01:19:23.081
All right, we need our three.
lt's gonna help out the morale.

01:19:23.252 --> 01:19:26.710
Send the kicking team in. Let's go.
Gotta end this game with three points.

01:19:26.889 --> 01:19:29.449
Yeah. Send them in.
Kicking team, let's go.

01:19:42.939 --> 01:19:45.237
Dawson. Send them in!

01:19:48.311 --> 01:19:50.074
Call it in, Red!

01:19:51.547 --> 01:19:53.208
Call it in!

01:19:56.953 --> 01:19:58.750
Send them in!

01:20:00.957 --> 01:20:02.390
Kick it! Kick it!

01:20:03.192 --> 01:20:05.251
Field-goal unit! Let's go!

01:20:14.103 --> 01:20:15.593
Let's go!

01:20:35.925 --> 01:20:39.520
<i>These kids do have plenty of heart,</i>
<i>but just not enough skill or experience...</i>

01:20:39.695 --> 01:20:42.163
<i>...to compete at this level.</i>
<i>And with this loss...</i>

01:20:42.331 --> 01:20:46.028
<i>...next week's first home game against</i>
<i>Xavier University won't be any easier.</i>

01:20:46.202 --> 01:20:49.831
<i>The Xavier game will be the first</i>
<i>home game since the devastating crash...</i>

01:20:50.006 --> 01:20:52.941
<i>...that killed 75 players and fans.</i>

01:20:53.109 --> 01:20:56.943
<i>After this painful loss,</i>
<i>the Marshall faithful must be wondering...</i>

01:20:57.113 --> 01:20:59.411
<i>...if they've done the right thing.</i>

01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:19.327
Pick it up.

01:21:20.102 --> 01:21:21.660
Pick what up?
Pick my jersey up?

01:21:21.837 --> 01:21:24.670
lt ain't your jersey, it's Joe Hood's jersey.
Now, pick it up.

01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:26.569
-Who's Joe Hood?
-You don't know him.

01:21:26.742 --> 01:21:29.336
l'm not gonna ask you again.
Now, pick it up!

01:21:30.646 --> 01:21:36.778
Look, man, l came here to play ball, and l'm
gonna be as respectful as l can be...

01:21:36.952 --> 01:21:40.945
...but l'm the one playing
for this team now. l'm number 33.

01:21:41.123 --> 01:21:44.024
That's my jersey.
l'll do whatever l want with it!

01:21:46.595 --> 01:21:49.496
Hey, break it up! Break it up!
Listen to me, break it up right--

01:21:54.501 --> 01:22:00.201
Well, Meckstroth's ankle's just a sprain,
so he should be better by Saturday.

01:22:00.373 --> 01:22:03.240
And Meadows' hamstring, it's okay too.

01:22:03.410 --> 01:22:06.538
What about Ruffin's shoulder?
What'd the doc say?

01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:11.144
Well, it ain't good.
l think we better sit him, Jack.

01:22:12.252 --> 01:22:13.981
Well, he's not gonna like that.

01:22:14.154 --> 01:22:17.487
Well, he ain't gonna like trying
to write with the other hand, either...

01:22:17.657 --> 01:22:20.057
...and that's what he's looking at
if he keeps going.

01:22:20.226 --> 01:22:23.889
Okay, well, let's see what he can do
in practice. Thank you.

01:22:25.098 --> 01:22:28.534
Split right, 434-Z-Slant.
Let it develop and trust it.

01:22:28.701 --> 01:22:30.168
Trust it. Make the play. Go.

01:22:30.336 --> 01:22:31.598
Here he comes, D!

01:22:36.309 --> 01:22:38.277
Forty-two! Set, hut!

01:22:48.988 --> 01:22:51.115
What's your problem?
We're on the same team!

01:22:57.330 --> 01:22:59.457
Make them commit.
Make it so. Make it so.

01:23:05.738 --> 01:23:06.762
Set, hut!

01:23:15.315 --> 01:23:17.442
Hey! Break it up! Break it up now!

01:23:20.220 --> 01:23:22.711
l can't take that!
Man, you want some of me?

01:23:22.889 --> 01:23:24.652
Get back there!

01:23:28.361 --> 01:23:30.124
Get back in the huddle!

01:23:38.905 --> 01:23:41.135
All right, let's go.

01:23:46.079 --> 01:23:48.946
Fourteen! Set, hut!

01:23:54.721 --> 01:23:57.383
That's it. Walsh, did you see that?
That's success!

01:24:03.897 --> 01:24:05.524
Ruffin!

01:24:06.166 --> 01:24:09.294
Ruffin! What the hell
is the matter with you?

01:24:09.469 --> 01:24:11.699
Just playing till the whistle blew, coach.

01:24:11.871 --> 01:24:13.168
Bullshit!

01:24:13.873 --> 01:24:16.774
You think you're the only one
who has a right to be pissed off?

01:24:16.943 --> 01:24:19.377
You think you're the only one
that's had it rough?

01:24:53.079 --> 01:24:56.947
Ruffin, get up. Get up, Ruffin.
That's enough.

01:24:57.116 --> 01:24:58.777
Go water down.

01:24:59.852 --> 01:25:01.877
-Oliver, you okay?
-Yeah.

01:25:04.724 --> 01:25:06.555
Where are you going?

01:25:08.995 --> 01:25:10.963
What the hell are we
doing out there, Jack?

01:25:11.130 --> 01:25:14.190
We're trying to run a Veer.
We're trying to get ready for Xavier.

01:25:14.367 --> 01:25:15.698
Really?

01:25:17.337 --> 01:25:20.067
Feels a lot more
like Bloody Knuckles to me.

01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:23.732
l mean, it feels like we're just
punching walls out there, Jack.

01:25:24.744 --> 01:25:27.235
l mean, we're not actually helping them.

01:25:27.413 --> 01:25:31.042
We're bringing the worst out in them.
Shit, we're bringing the worst out in me.

01:25:32.452 --> 01:25:33.885
And for what?

01:25:34.053 --> 01:25:38.456
So that we can collect pity applause
in front of every college in the conference?

01:25:42.161 --> 01:25:44.356
You didn't know Rick Tolley.

01:25:44.864 --> 01:25:46.092
l did.

01:25:46.566 --> 01:25:50.058
And on the day that he died, he said...

01:25:50.236 --> 01:25:54.900
...the only thing that they judge us on,
the only thing that counts, is winning.

01:25:55.074 --> 01:25:56.632
Nothing else matters.

01:25:57.210 --> 01:26:00.646
So, what do we do?
How are we honoring their memory?

01:26:00.813 --> 01:26:05.546
We put together a team
that doesn't win. Can't win.

01:26:05.718 --> 01:26:11.281
Not this week, not this season.
Hell, maybe not ever.

01:26:12.892 --> 01:26:15.656
We're not honoring them, Jack.

01:26:17.930 --> 01:26:19.830
We're disgracing them.

01:26:25.004 --> 01:26:26.562
l'm done.

01:26:38.418 --> 01:26:40.648
Don't bench me, coach.

01:26:44.624 --> 01:26:47.184
-Jesus, Nate, have you even slept?
-Not now.

01:26:48.628 --> 01:26:51.188
Not before our first home game.

01:26:51.364 --> 01:26:54.891
Now, look, Nate, your shoulder
is in bad shape.

01:26:55.068 --> 01:26:56.899
The rest is gonna do it some good.

01:26:57.070 --> 01:27:00.597
No. No, it ain't.
The rest ain't gonna do it good.

01:27:00.773 --> 01:27:04.300
Nate, l'm not questioning your courage
or your drive, okay?

01:27:04.477 --> 01:27:07.640
-My shoulder's fine.
-This shoulder?

01:27:07.814 --> 01:27:10.078
lt's ready to take the field?
lt's ready for hits?

01:27:10.249 --> 01:27:11.682
-My shoulder's fine.
-Yes or no?

01:27:11.851 --> 01:27:13.648
-My shoulder's fine. Yeah.
-This one?

01:27:13.820 --> 01:27:16.050
-Can it take hits like that?
-My shoulder's fine.

01:27:16.222 --> 01:27:17.746
Gonna be a lot harder than that.

01:27:17.924 --> 01:27:20.449
My shoulder's fine.

01:27:30.203 --> 01:27:31.966
Talk to me.

01:27:32.138 --> 01:27:34.299
Oh, coach.

01:27:38.311 --> 01:27:41.644
That was my team.

01:27:46.819 --> 01:27:49.947
They left it in my hands.

01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:57.594
Oh, Nate.
No, no, no, they did not.

01:27:57.764 --> 01:27:59.493
No.

01:27:59.665 --> 01:28:01.724
They just left.

01:28:03.035 --> 01:28:05.026
Then why?

01:28:09.342 --> 01:28:11.435
Why, coach?

01:28:13.613 --> 01:28:15.308
Why?

01:28:18.885 --> 01:28:20.113
l don't know.

01:28:55.021 --> 01:28:57.990
The board voted you out this morning.

01:28:58.157 --> 01:29:01.388
What? May l ask why?

01:29:01.561 --> 01:29:06.828
Come on, Don.
You were always a temporary solution.

01:29:06.999 --> 01:29:09.490
You said it yourself after Roland resigned.

01:29:09.669 --> 01:29:12.502
You were just a Band-Aid, remember?

01:29:13.139 --> 01:29:16.199
ls this about the football program, Paul?

01:29:17.810 --> 01:29:20.278
The crash just cut too damn deep, Don.

01:29:20.446 --> 01:29:24.246
lt's not just the team that's bleeding.
lt's not just the school.

01:29:24.417 --> 01:29:25.850
lt's the entire town.

01:29:26.018 --> 01:29:28.578
Do you have any idea
what it's like for Annie right now?

01:29:28.754 --> 01:29:31.689
She can't read the paper.
She can't watch the news.

01:29:31.858 --> 01:29:35.589
She can't even go to work
without being reminded of football...

01:29:35.761 --> 01:29:40.664
...which reminds her of the crash,
which reminds her of my dead son!

01:29:43.870 --> 01:29:45.633
Paul.

01:29:45.805 --> 01:29:48.273
This isn't about football, is it?

01:29:48.975 --> 01:29:53.912
And this isn't about Annie.
And this isn't about the town, Paul.

01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:58.642
This is about the loss of your son.
And l'm sorry.

01:29:58.818 --> 01:30:02.618
But until you find the strength
to deal with that pain...

01:30:02.788 --> 01:30:05.780
...nothing's going to get any better.

01:30:05.958 --> 01:30:09.724
No matter how many presidents
you fire, Paul.

01:30:30.082 --> 01:30:32.642
Just about closed. Sorry.

01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:39.287
My wife tells me you've got
the best apple pie in Huntington.

01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:42.551
Depends on the apple.

01:30:43.963 --> 01:30:46.397
Well, do you mind if l try?

01:30:48.267 --> 01:30:49.962
Hey, Annie.

01:30:58.077 --> 01:31:00.637
-Annie Cantrell?
-Yeah.

01:31:02.114 --> 01:31:04.981
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

01:31:14.694 --> 01:31:16.525
Mr. Griffen?

01:31:17.463 --> 01:31:20.557
l don't believe we've been
formally introduced yet.

01:31:20.733 --> 01:31:22.633
l'm Jack Lengyel.

01:31:25.471 --> 01:31:27.029
Thank you.

01:31:33.546 --> 01:31:37.038
l understand Don Dedmon
lost his job this week.

01:31:37.216 --> 01:31:40.708
He's well-qualified, he'll find a place.

01:31:44.690 --> 01:31:48.922
You know, if you have a problem
with anything that happens on the field...

01:31:49.095 --> 01:31:52.121
...blame me, not him. l'm the coach here.

01:31:52.298 --> 01:31:55.665
And what happens out there
is my responsibility, not his.

01:31:55.835 --> 01:31:58.360
You're not from here,
you weren't here last November...

01:31:58.537 --> 01:32:01.301
...so l don't expect you
to understand this.

01:32:02.842 --> 01:32:04.935
This is not about what happened
on that field.

01:32:05.111 --> 01:32:07.944
This is about what happened
to this town.

01:32:08.114 --> 01:32:09.877
This is not a game.

01:32:28.467 --> 01:32:32.460
l'm real sorry about your son,
Mr. Griffen.

01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:36.936
He was a hell of a running back.
l bet you were real proud.

01:32:37.109 --> 01:32:39.339
Please don't talk about him
like you knew him.

01:32:41.714 --> 01:32:43.909
l was proud of him,
and l'm still proud of him.

01:34:36.896 --> 01:34:38.329
He was right, you know.

01:34:42.034 --> 01:34:45.492
-Who was right?
-Your boy Tolley.

01:34:46.272 --> 01:34:49.867
Winning is everything
and nothing else matters.

01:34:50.042 --> 01:34:53.705
l mean, l've said that
so many times myself...

01:34:53.879 --> 01:34:57.406
...l've lost count. You know?

01:34:57.583 --> 01:35:00.984
And it doesn't matter in what sport,
and it doesn't matter what country...

01:35:01.153 --> 01:35:06.113
...any coach who's worth a darn
in this business believes those words.

01:35:06.292 --> 01:35:08.055
Fact.

01:35:11.964 --> 01:35:13.955
And then l came here.

01:35:16.302 --> 01:35:17.769
For the first time in my life...

01:35:17.937 --> 01:35:21.600
...hell, maybe for the first time
in the history of sports...

01:35:21.774 --> 01:35:25.107
...suddenly, it's just not true anymore.

01:35:26.445 --> 01:35:29.539
At least not here, not now. No.

01:35:32.051 --> 01:35:33.712
You see...

01:35:34.353 --> 01:35:37.516
...Red, it doesn't matter if we win
or if we lose.

01:35:37.690 --> 01:35:39.851
lt's not even about
how we play the game.

01:35:40.025 --> 01:35:44.257
What matters is that we play the game.

01:35:44.763 --> 01:35:47.789
That we take the field,
that we suit up on Saturdays...

01:35:47.967 --> 01:35:50.629
...and we keep this program alive.

01:35:50.803 --> 01:35:54.398
We play the game, Red,
and l'm telling you, one day...

01:35:54.573 --> 01:35:57.167
...not today, not tomorrow,
not this season...

01:35:57.343 --> 01:36:02.440
...probably not next season either,
but one day, you and l are gonna wake up...

01:36:02.615 --> 01:36:06.574
...and suddenly we're gonna be like
every other team in every other sport...

01:36:06.752 --> 01:36:11.086
...where winning is everything
and nothing else matters.

01:36:13.492 --> 01:36:15.892
And when that day comes...

01:36:21.634 --> 01:36:24.467
...well, that's when we'll honor them.

01:36:29.541 --> 01:36:32.908
We've got a team meeting
tomorrow morning, Red.

01:36:33.412 --> 01:36:36.142
Got a little field trip planned
for the boys...

01:36:39.251 --> 01:36:41.481
...and, well, we'd love
to see you there, coach.

01:36:45.024 --> 01:36:47.015
We'd love to see you there.

01:37:05.577 --> 01:37:08.671
Seven on the goal line. Tough on....

01:37:08.847 --> 01:37:10.838
Secondary C five through eight.

01:37:11.016 --> 01:37:14.816
D can prevent kicking game onside
and kickoff.

01:37:14.987 --> 01:37:16.716
Game day.

01:37:18.590 --> 01:37:20.615
Yes, it is.

01:37:26.231 --> 01:37:28.722
l left your ticket on the kitchen counter.

01:37:28.901 --> 01:37:32.962
l would appreciate it if you could make it
to the game before halftime.

01:37:34.540 --> 01:37:39.534
One time. l missed kickoff one time
and you'll never let me forget it.

01:37:39.712 --> 01:37:41.703
No, no, no, l won't.

01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:44.781
Because if l don't see you
in the stands, honey...

01:37:44.950 --> 01:37:49.410
...l don't know, l get all out of whack,
you know?

01:37:50.322 --> 01:37:54.224
-l'll be there.
-l know you will.

01:37:57.029 --> 01:37:59.020
How big a crowd do you think you'll get?

01:37:59.198 --> 01:38:02.656
-Well, after last week, l don't know.
-Yeah.

01:38:04.236 --> 01:38:05.703
-Hey, buddy.
-Hey.

01:38:05.871 --> 01:38:08.203
l'll race you to the ''newpacer.''

01:38:09.742 --> 01:38:13.143
-The what?
-Newspaper.

01:38:13.312 --> 01:38:14.836
-When, right now?
-Yeah.

01:38:15.014 --> 01:38:18.575
l don't know. Maybe!

01:38:19.151 --> 01:38:20.812
Get him! Run!

01:38:22.187 --> 01:38:24.747
Hey, hey, hey--

01:38:27.326 --> 01:38:29.191
Hey, coach!

01:38:31.296 --> 01:38:34.390
-Lengyel!
-Win, Coach Lengyel!

01:38:40.873 --> 01:38:42.932
-What day is it, son?
-Game day.

01:38:43.108 --> 01:38:44.507
-What day?
-Game day!

01:38:44.676 --> 01:38:47.474
Time to play until the whistle blows.

01:38:48.947 --> 01:38:52.280
-See you on the field.
-See you there!

01:38:56.522 --> 01:38:58.513
Hi, Mr. Griffen.

01:39:00.392 --> 01:39:03.384
Does nobody eat in this town anymore?

01:39:03.562 --> 01:39:05.655
Not today, anyway.

01:39:07.099 --> 01:39:08.532
You should go.

01:39:08.700 --> 01:39:11.601
Oh, no, my shift ends in a few hours.
lt's no big deal.

01:39:11.770 --> 01:39:13.795
That's not what l meant.

01:39:15.908 --> 01:39:17.500
Come on.

01:39:18.077 --> 01:39:20.068
Let's take a walk.

01:39:20.245 --> 01:39:23.146
l don't think your customers will mind.

01:39:24.917 --> 01:39:27.613
Do you know l was baptized
right here in the Ohio?

01:39:27.786 --> 01:39:30.880
Swam in it all the time when l was a kid.

01:39:31.223 --> 01:39:32.656
When l was away at the war...

01:39:34.026 --> 01:39:37.655
...l'd fall asleep at night
to the sound of this water.

01:39:38.097 --> 01:39:43.399
When my wife died,
l'd lay awake to the same sound.

01:39:44.870 --> 01:39:47.839
Whenever l see this river,
l know l'm home.

01:39:50.476 --> 01:39:52.740
This is my home, Annie.

01:39:55.214 --> 01:39:57.614
You were going to California
with my son.

01:39:59.952 --> 01:40:03.581
-How long have you known?
-l'm his father, l've always known.

01:40:04.656 --> 01:40:06.954
You should go, Annie.

01:40:10.696 --> 01:40:12.789
Things have changed now.

01:40:13.632 --> 01:40:16.829
l mean, l have responsibilities,
l have a job.

01:40:18.637 --> 01:40:20.366
And you.

01:40:21.573 --> 01:40:24.838
-You're all alone. l can't--
-Oh, stop, stop. You can't put that on me.

01:40:25.010 --> 01:40:27.103
You've gotta go out there
and live your life.

01:40:27.546 --> 01:40:30.674
lf you don't leave now, you never will.

01:40:32.885 --> 01:40:35.877
You're all out of excuses, Annie.

01:40:36.522 --> 01:40:38.990
You can't stay for me
and you can't stay for your job.

01:40:39.158 --> 01:40:40.489
Why not?

01:40:40.659 --> 01:40:43.787
Because when l tell your boss
you left that restaurant unattended...

01:40:43.962 --> 01:40:45.554
...he's gonna have to fire you.

01:40:52.004 --> 01:40:54.438
Grief is messy, Annie.

01:40:55.007 --> 01:40:59.239
Makes you do things you regret,
sometimes things you'll always regret.

01:40:59.411 --> 01:41:01.003
l don't. l don't regret it.

01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:04.540
-l don't.
-l'm not talking about you.

01:41:06.518 --> 01:41:09.646
Go, Annie. Go.

01:41:56.034 --> 01:41:58.935
For those of you who may not know...

01:41:59.738 --> 01:42:03.139
...this is the final resting place
for six members...

01:42:03.308 --> 01:42:06.607
...of the 1 970 Thundering Herd.

01:42:07.813 --> 01:42:13.479
The plane crash that took their lives
was so severe, so absolute...

01:42:13.652 --> 01:42:16.815
...that their bodies were unable
to be identified.

01:42:17.289 --> 01:42:21.157
So they were buried here, together.

01:42:22.661 --> 01:42:24.629
Six players...

01:42:25.230 --> 01:42:27.095
...six teammates...

01:42:27.266 --> 01:42:30.235
...six sons of Marshall.

01:42:32.204 --> 01:42:35.173
This is our past, gentlemen.

01:42:39.544 --> 01:42:42.570
This is where we have been.
This is how we got here.

01:42:42.748 --> 01:42:44.875
This is who we are...

01:42:45.317 --> 01:42:47.080
...today.

01:42:49.554 --> 01:42:52.352
l wanna talk about our opponent
this afternoon.

01:42:53.258 --> 01:42:56.250
They're bigger, faster, stronger,
more experienced...

01:42:56.428 --> 01:42:59.295
...and on paper, they're just better.

01:42:59.464 --> 01:43:01.489
And they know it, too.

01:43:03.969 --> 01:43:06.631
But l wanna tell you something
that they don't know.

01:43:07.339 --> 01:43:10.240
They don't know your heart.

01:43:12.210 --> 01:43:16.613
l do. l've seen it.
You have shown it to me.

01:43:16.782 --> 01:43:20.240
You have shown this coaching staff,
your teammates.

01:43:20.419 --> 01:43:25.220
You have shown yourselves
just exactly who you are in here.

01:43:28.293 --> 01:43:30.853
Now, when you take that field today...

01:43:32.130 --> 01:43:35.156
...you've gotta lay
that heart on the line, men.

01:43:35.667 --> 01:43:39.603
From the soles of your feet, with every
ounce of blood you've got in your body...

01:43:39.771 --> 01:43:42.296
...lay it on the line
until the final whistle blows.

01:43:42.474 --> 01:43:44.442
And if you do that...

01:43:46.778 --> 01:43:48.712
...if you do that...

01:43:51.016 --> 01:43:52.415
...we cannot lose.

01:43:53.685 --> 01:43:56.779
We may be behind on the scoreboard
at the end of the game...

01:43:56.955 --> 01:44:01.722
...but if you play like that,
we cannot be defeated.

01:44:01.893 --> 01:44:04.191
Now, we came here today to remember...

01:44:05.564 --> 01:44:07.498
...six young men...

01:44:08.900 --> 01:44:11.164
...and 69 others...

01:44:13.004 --> 01:44:16.940
...who will not be on the field
with you today.

01:44:19.911 --> 01:44:22.141
But they will be watching.

01:44:25.851 --> 01:44:28.046
And you can bet your ass...

01:44:28.220 --> 01:44:32.452
...that they'll be gritting their teeth
with every snap of that football.

01:44:32.624 --> 01:44:36.321
You understand me?
How you play today...

01:44:37.095 --> 01:44:40.292
...from this moment on,
is how you...

01:44:41.299 --> 01:44:44.234
...will be remembered.

01:44:44.636 --> 01:44:49.596
This is your opportunity
to rise from these ashes...

01:44:49.775 --> 01:44:52.107
...and grab glory.

01:44:56.515 --> 01:44:58.244
-We are--
-Marshall!

01:44:58.417 --> 01:44:59.645
-We are--
-Marshall!

01:44:59.818 --> 01:45:00.944
-We are--
-Marshall!

01:45:01.119 --> 01:45:03.280
The funerals end today.

01:45:11.496 --> 01:45:14.465
<i>Marshall! Marshall! Marshall!</i>

01:45:20.272 --> 01:45:22.672
<i>Today, the Big Green is finally</i>
<i>back in Huntington...</i>

01:45:22.841 --> 01:45:25.833
<i>...in front of a capacity crowd</i>
<i>here at Fairfield Stadium.</i>

01:45:29.815 --> 01:45:32.784
<i>Number 1 9, Jake Crawford,</i>
<i>Xavier's all-American tailback...</i>

01:45:32.951 --> 01:45:35.317
<i>...fields the ball and takes off downfield.</i>

01:45:39.191 --> 01:45:43.787
<i>Crawford still untouched at the 30, the 35.</i>
<i>This kid's got speed, doesn't he?</i>

01:45:43.962 --> 01:45:47.022
<i>He sure does. Just one man to beat.</i>

01:45:47.199 --> 01:45:50.327
<i>-It looks like Morehead State all over again.</i>
-Oh, gosh.

01:45:51.336 --> 01:45:53.964
<i>-They come with a huge hit.</i>
-That's how you hit somebody!

01:45:54.139 --> 01:45:55.970
Nice looping!

01:45:57.976 --> 01:46:00.171
All right. All right,
tighten up, D, tighten up.

01:46:04.716 --> 01:46:06.343
Good job, good job!

01:46:08.019 --> 01:46:10.544
Nice lick. Nice save.

01:46:10.722 --> 01:46:12.622
<i>Sophomore Reggie Oliver</i>
<i>takes the field...</i>

01:46:12.791 --> 01:46:15.123
<i>...and leads the offense</i>
<i>on their first possession.</i>

01:46:15.293 --> 01:46:16.658
Set, hut!

01:46:21.166 --> 01:46:22.929
Hut!

01:46:26.972 --> 01:46:28.701
Punt! Punt. Punt team.

01:46:33.712 --> 01:46:34.804
Come on, cover it!

01:46:36.648 --> 01:46:38.343
<i>Just the punter to beat.</i>

01:46:40.085 --> 01:46:44.021
<i>-The shoestring tackle by Bill Shalhoop!</i>
-That's playing till the whistle blows.

01:46:44.189 --> 01:46:47.590
You kick it and you play defense.
Good job, Shalhoop.

01:46:47.759 --> 01:46:50.250
All right, let's go. Let's get a stop.

01:46:51.329 --> 01:46:53.923
<i>Crawford gets a step on Ruffin.</i>

01:46:56.535 --> 01:46:58.662
<i>And makes another catch</i>
<i>for another first down.</i>

01:46:58.837 --> 01:47:02.603
<i>Boy, I'll tell you what, that hurt shoulder</i>
<i>sure looks like it's affecting Ruffin.</i>

01:47:02.774 --> 01:47:06.608
-That kid knows he can't go to his right.
-He's playing to it. Keep an eye on that.

01:47:09.381 --> 01:47:11.713
-Split six, cover one. Ready? Break!
-Break!

01:47:11.883 --> 01:47:14.909
<i>We've got a scoreless game,</i>
<i>and Xavier has great field position...</i>

01:47:15.086 --> 01:47:19.079
<i>...but they're in a race against the clock</i>
<i>with only 25 seconds till halftime.</i>

01:47:19.257 --> 01:47:20.417
Hut!

01:47:22.193 --> 01:47:23.592
-Right side!
-Make the hit!

01:47:26.364 --> 01:47:27.956
<i>Ruffin with a giant hit.</i>

01:47:28.133 --> 01:47:29.930
-Ball! Ball! Ball!
<i>-The ball is loose!</i>

01:47:30.101 --> 01:47:31.796
Go, go, go!

01:47:37.208 --> 01:47:40.541
-Nice hit. Nice ball.
-Nate, you all right?

01:47:40.712 --> 01:47:42.407
-Can you get up, Nate?
-Hold on, 25.

01:47:42.581 --> 01:47:44.708
l'm sitting him the second half,
no matter what.

01:47:44.883 --> 01:47:47.579
-Let me tell him. Let me tell him.
-You got it, you got it.

01:47:47.752 --> 01:47:49.879
Mickey Jackson!

01:47:52.924 --> 01:47:54.255
Good. All right.

01:47:54.426 --> 01:47:57.486
<i>There's enough time on the clock</i>
<i>for one last play before the half.</i>

01:47:57.662 --> 01:47:59.254
Need a 37-yard field goal.

01:47:59.431 --> 01:48:02.662
<i>Marshall's kicking game was spotty at best</i>
<i>last week against Morehead.</i>

01:48:02.834 --> 01:48:03.892
Blake, come on!

01:48:04.069 --> 01:48:06.833
<i>Let's see what Lengyel</i>
<i>decides to do here.</i>

01:48:11.977 --> 01:48:14.002
We're kicking it.
Let's go, we're kicking it.

01:48:14.179 --> 01:48:17.307
<i>This is an awfully long kick</i>
<i>for sophomore Blake Smith...</i>

01:48:17.482 --> 01:48:20.246
<i>...a walk-on from Marshall's soccer team.</i>

01:48:37.535 --> 01:48:39.298
<i>The kick is good!</i>

01:48:41.006 --> 01:48:41.995
Hey!

01:48:42.173 --> 01:48:44.198
-That's groovy, baby!
-That's groovy, baby.

01:48:44.643 --> 01:48:47.009
<i>I don't believe it.</i>
<i>The Young Thundering Herd...</i>

01:48:47.178 --> 01:48:49.646
<i>...has a 3-0 lead</i>
<i>as they take it into halftime.</i>

01:48:49.814 --> 01:48:51.782
Hot damn,
he's liable to make that from 50.

01:48:51.950 --> 01:48:52.939
Good call.

01:48:53.118 --> 01:48:55.382
<i>Stick around.</i>
<i>We've got a dogfight on our hands...</i>

01:48:55.553 --> 01:48:59.011
<i>...as Xavier is certainly</i>
<i>a second-half team.</i>

01:49:02.127 --> 01:49:06.393
<i>-We are--</i>
<i>-Marshall!</i>

01:49:06.564 --> 01:49:10.364
<i>-We are--</i>
<i>-Marshall!</i>

01:49:13.405 --> 01:49:16.238
Damn it, coach, l said l'm all right.

01:49:20.779 --> 01:49:22.770
Nate, you're sitting.

01:49:29.487 --> 01:49:31.455
You can't do that, coach.
l gotta cover 1 9.

01:49:31.623 --> 01:49:33.989
Nineteen's got six catches
for 95 yards, Nate...

01:49:34.159 --> 01:49:36.719
...and it's because he knows
you can't go to your right.

01:49:36.895 --> 01:49:40.922
-We got two more quarters of football.
-Yes, we do. Yes, we do, Nate.

01:49:41.633 --> 01:49:43.658
But you've done enough.

01:49:44.402 --> 01:49:47.235
Coach, l've been going to my right
all day--

01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:50.806
You see what's going on out there?

01:49:54.846 --> 01:49:58.577
Nate, that's all because
you never stopped pushing.

01:49:59.818 --> 01:50:03.379
-We got two more quarters of football.
-You've done enough, Nate.

01:50:05.190 --> 01:50:07.385
You've done enough.

01:50:29.214 --> 01:50:31.546
Are we gonna be all right, coach?

01:50:34.252 --> 01:50:37.050
Yeah. We're gonna be all right.

01:50:38.223 --> 01:50:40.384
Yeah, we're gonna be all right.

01:50:41.226 --> 01:50:43.319
<i>Thanks for joining us</i>
<i>back at halftime, folks.</i>

01:50:43.495 --> 01:50:47.056
<i>You know what's hard to fathom?</i>
<i>It's hard to believe this is even possible...</i>

01:50:47.232 --> 01:50:50.201
<i>...but Jack Lengyel</i>
<i>has the Marshall Young Thundering Herd...</i>

01:50:50.368 --> 01:50:53.462
<i>...a team of freshmen, of transfer students,</i>
<i>of walk-ons...</i>

01:50:53.638 --> 01:50:55.868
<i>...a team of nobodies and no ones...</i>

01:50:56.040 --> 01:51:00.306
<i>...somehow are beating the Xavier Pirates</i>
<i>after 30 minutes of football.</i>

01:51:00.478 --> 01:51:03.606
<i>Well, that is true,</i>
<i>but I gotta believe that, at some point...</i>

01:51:03.782 --> 01:51:06.273
<i>...speed, size and experience will prevail.</i>

01:51:09.020 --> 01:51:10.988
Come on, Booth!

01:51:18.263 --> 01:51:20.128
That's the way to start the second half!

01:51:20.298 --> 01:51:24.132
<i>This Young Thundering Herd looks like</i>
<i>they're ready to play.</i>

01:51:24.302 --> 01:51:26.827
-44-X-Punch. Let's go.
-Break!

01:51:27.005 --> 01:51:29.473
Nineteen, set, hut!

01:51:32.310 --> 01:51:33.777
<i>-Big hit on Oliver...</i>
-Ball!

01:51:34.712 --> 01:51:38.512
<i>...who loses the ball. Xavier scoops it up.</i>

01:51:38.683 --> 01:51:39.672
Let's go!

01:51:39.851 --> 01:51:41.341
<i>He's on the 30...</i>

01:51:41.519 --> 01:51:42.986
<i>...the 20...</i>

01:51:43.521 --> 01:51:45.989
<i>...touchdown, Xavier!</i>

01:51:46.724 --> 01:51:49.784
<i>And just like that,</i>
<i>Xavier takes the lead, 6-3.</i>

01:51:49.961 --> 01:51:52.020
lt's okay! Come on!

01:51:52.197 --> 01:51:54.461
-You're still the captain of this team.
-Yes, sir.

01:51:54.632 --> 01:51:57.396
l'm gonna need you to be that captain
from the sideline.

01:51:57.569 --> 01:51:59.799
Set, hut!

01:51:59.971 --> 01:52:02.064
-Yeah, baby, let's go!
-Come on, let's go!

01:52:08.479 --> 01:52:10.504
-Great call.
-All right?

01:52:12.584 --> 01:52:14.575
Twenty-two!

01:52:15.253 --> 01:52:16.845
All right. Yeah.

01:52:19.023 --> 01:52:20.217
lt's your team now.

01:52:22.794 --> 01:52:24.352
Set, hut!

01:52:27.031 --> 01:52:28.999
<i>Nice flag route by Bill James.</i>

01:52:31.102 --> 01:52:33.900
<i>He's got one foot inbounds.</i>
<i>That's good for a first down.</i>

01:52:34.072 --> 01:52:37.564
-Yeah! Come on!
-Thought you were a basketball player.

01:52:40.078 --> 01:52:42.774
lf he doesn't pass, give it to Wooch.
lf he does, tuck it.

01:52:42.947 --> 01:52:44.642
-Tuck it and go.
-lt's up to you. Go.

01:52:44.816 --> 01:52:47.979
<i>Oliver in with the play.</i>
<i>They're close, folks, very, very close.</i>

01:52:48.152 --> 01:52:51.918
<i>Just four yards</i>
<i>from a Thundering Herd score.</i>

01:52:53.691 --> 01:52:55.386
Come on, Reggie.

01:53:21.452 --> 01:53:23.249
<i>Touchdown, Reggie Oliver!</i>

01:53:23.888 --> 01:53:26.186
<i>And Marshall grabs the lead right back,</i>
<i>9-6...</i>

01:53:26.357 --> 01:53:29.292
<i>...with eight seconds remaining</i>
<i>in the third quarter.</i>

01:53:30.361 --> 01:53:32.261
Let's go!

01:53:33.331 --> 01:53:36.528
That's what it looks like on paper
right there, doesn't it?

01:53:46.844 --> 01:53:49.506
<i>If Marshall can hold on</i>
<i>for a little while longer, folks--</i>

01:53:49.681 --> 01:53:51.808
<i>But there's a complete pass to Crawford!</i>

01:53:51.983 --> 01:53:53.280
Go, go, go!

01:53:56.354 --> 01:53:57.821
<i>He breaks free.</i>

01:53:58.990 --> 01:54:01.083
<i>And he's in the end zone.</i>
<i>Touchdown, Xavier.</i>

01:54:01.259 --> 01:54:05.161
<i>Oh, my. What a dagger to the heart</i>
<i>of this Marshall team.</i>

01:54:06.230 --> 01:54:09.597
<i>And with the extra point, Xavier has</i>
<i>taken the lead back from Marshall...</i>

01:54:09.767 --> 01:54:13.134
<i>... 1 3-9 with one minute left to play.</i>

01:54:17.508 --> 01:54:20.671
<i>-We are--</i>
-Let's go, Marshall! Come on!

01:54:21.946 --> 01:54:24.107
<i>Marshall has time</i>
<i>for one last-ditch effort...</i>

01:54:24.282 --> 01:54:27.479
<i>...but they'll have to march</i>
<i>all the way downfield into the end zone.</i>

01:54:27.652 --> 01:54:31.349
<i>-A field goal will not be enough.</i>
-Thirteen! Set, hut!

01:54:36.594 --> 01:54:39.392
<i>Oliver breaks loose.</i>
<i>He's in the open field!</i>

01:54:39.564 --> 01:54:41.828
Go, go, go!

01:54:42.433 --> 01:54:44.958
<i>Something's happening here</i>
<i>for the Thundering Herd.</i>

01:54:45.136 --> 01:54:47.900
Down, down, down! On the ball!

01:54:48.072 --> 01:54:50.040
We got one time-out, coach.

01:54:52.510 --> 01:54:56.810
-l-1 3! l-1 3!
-Run your offense. Run your offense.

01:54:56.981 --> 01:54:58.380
Set, hut!

01:54:58.549 --> 01:55:02.679
<i>Oliver holds the ball, rolls out,</i>
<i>and is sacked.</i>

01:55:02.854 --> 01:55:05.015
<i>That's gonna be costly</i>
<i>as the clock keeps tick--</i>

01:55:05.189 --> 01:55:07.749
<i>No, wait, he got rid of it!</i>
<i>He got rid of it!</i>

01:55:11.763 --> 01:55:13.526
<i>A huge gain for the Herd!</i>

01:55:13.698 --> 01:55:16.792
<i>Marshall marches upfield,</i>
<i>but with less than 30 seconds left...</i>

01:55:16.968 --> 01:55:20.699
<i>-...time is running out for the boys in green.</i>
-Time-out. Time-out.

01:55:20.872 --> 01:55:23.170
<i>Marshall calls their last time-out.</i>

01:55:25.777 --> 01:55:26.766
Come on, Marshall!

01:55:27.045 --> 01:55:30.811
Zero time-outs. We need a touchdown
to win. Here's the play:

01:55:30.982 --> 01:55:35.578
Fire left, 422-Z-Rocket, all right?
Martin, Johnson or Linden.

01:55:35.753 --> 01:55:39.746
After you catch the football,
if you cannot score, get out of bounds.

01:55:39.924 --> 01:55:42.757
lf you do not get out of bounds,
everybody get to the line...

01:55:42.927 --> 01:55:45.862
...Coach Red Dawson's got the winning play
coming in, all right?

01:55:46.030 --> 01:55:47.588
There is no huddle from here out.

01:55:47.765 --> 01:55:48.993
-Do you believe?
-Yes, sir!

01:55:49.167 --> 01:55:50.361
-Do you believe?
-Yes, sir!

01:55:50.535 --> 01:55:51.593
-We are--
-Marshall!

01:55:52.403 --> 01:55:54.462
<i>This is it, folks.</i>

01:55:55.373 --> 01:55:56.601
Okay.

01:56:02.613 --> 01:56:05.241
<i>Gotta get out of bounds</i>
<i>to stop the clock.</i>

01:56:05.416 --> 01:56:07.782
-Get out of bounds!
-Get out, get out, get out!

01:56:07.952 --> 01:56:11.911
<i>Clock is still ticking. He didn't make it!</i>
<i>He's still inbounds.</i>

01:56:12.090 --> 01:56:16.151
-Clock's running, clock's running.
-Call it in. Take us home, Red. Call it in.

01:56:18.229 --> 01:56:19.821
Gardner, Gardner! All right.

01:56:19.997 --> 01:56:24.229
Split right, 21 3 Bootleg Screen.
Bootleg Screen!

01:56:37.582 --> 01:56:39.015
-Get it off!
-Snap it.

01:56:41.319 --> 01:56:42.843
Snap the ball.

01:56:43.788 --> 01:56:46.120
Snap it. Snap it.

01:58:11.442 --> 01:58:15.811
<i>It's good! Gardner catches the ball!</i>
<i>Touchdown! Touchdown!</i>

01:58:15.980 --> 01:58:20.417
<i>I can't believe it! I can't believe it!</i>
<i>Marshall has won!</i>

01:58:20.585 --> 01:58:24.578
<i>The Young Thundering Herd has won!</i>
<i>They have done the unthinkable!</i>

01:58:24.755 --> 01:58:27.417
-We scored?
<i>-Marshall has beaten Xavier!</i>

01:58:27.592 --> 01:58:31.585
<i>This is an exciting day, folks! Incredible!</i>

01:58:31.762 --> 01:58:36.563
<i>The skies parted</i>
<i>and Marshall took command!</i>

01:58:36.968 --> 01:58:40.529
<i>They proved that they were men today,</i>
<i>that they were a team!</i>

01:58:40.705 --> 01:58:42.434
-We did it! We did it!
<i>-Marshall wins!</i>

01:58:42.607 --> 01:58:44.541
<i>Marshall wins in a barnburner, folks!</i>

01:58:44.709 --> 01:58:48.042
<i>They're gonna remember this one</i>
<i>for decades!</i>

01:58:52.149 --> 01:58:55.175
Lengyel! We did it!

01:58:57.288 --> 01:59:00.485
We did it! We did it! We did it! We did it!

01:59:13.337 --> 01:59:15.737
-Oh, gosh.
-Little tradition.

01:59:15.906 --> 01:59:21.071
At the end of a game, we always give
the ball to the most valuable player.

01:59:21.245 --> 01:59:23.110
That's for you.

01:59:24.749 --> 01:59:27.809
Jack, l'm not one of the players.

01:59:27.985 --> 01:59:29.885
l know, Don.

01:59:31.022 --> 01:59:34.583
We're Marshall. We'll take anybody.

01:59:35.626 --> 01:59:38.561
Thank you. Thank you, Don.

01:59:56.414 --> 02:00:01.909

02:00:34.018 --> 02:00:37.351
<i>Gene Morehouse's son, Keith,</i>
<i>followed in his father's footsteps...</i>

02:00:37.521 --> 02:00:40.786

02:00:41.625 --> 02:00:44.321

02:00:50.101 --> 02:00:52.797
<i>He eventually returned to Marshall</i>
<i>as an assistant coach...</i>

02:00:52.970 --> 02:00:55.200

02:01:12.423 --> 02:01:15.950

02:01:20.765 --> 02:01:24.963
<i>Red Dawson kept his word and left the team</i>
<i>at the end of the year.</i>

02:01:27.037 --> 02:01:29.699

02:02:39.610 --> 02:02:42.010
Congratulations to you too.

l didn't mean to keep you waiting.
l just....

02:02:57.761 --> 02:03:02.095
Red, you didn't keep me waiting.

02:03:03.234 --> 02:03:04.929
Come here.

02:03:17.081 --> 02:03:19.777
Nobody here wants to go home either.

02:03:30.694 --> 02:03:33.162
<i>Marshall lost more football games</i>
<i>in the '7 0s...</i>

02:03:33.330 --> 02:03:36.128

02:03:36.767 --> 02:03:39.930
