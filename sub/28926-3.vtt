-Yeah.

Yeah, it fell in the night.
It lost its magnetism.

-And the same exact thing happened

09:45.209 --> 09:47.003
at my house the day before.

09:47.086 --> 09:49.171
-Wow.
-And I thought, "Okay, that's weird."

Right? Why are all these magnets
suddenly losing their magnetism?

09:52.508 --> 09:54.385
-Uh-huh?
-So, I went and saw Scott.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.559
He's pretty brilliant, actually.

10:01.642 --> 10:03.603
And I asked him, "How is this happening?"

10:03.686 --> 10:08.316
And he built this magnetic field
using an AC transformer

10:08.399 --> 10:10.234
and plugging it into a solenoid.

10:10.318 --> 10:12.695

which basically--

okay?

No, you've outdone yourself.

10:36.761 --> 10:39.555
Oh, come on, Hop,
you're not even listening to me.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.808
Scott was able to demagnetize
some of the magnets, and he thinks--

10:42.892 --> 10:44.310
I don't care what Scott thinks!

10:44.393 --> 10:49.357
He thinks that a large-scale
magnetic field could be built

10:49.440 --> 10:52.985
using some sort of machine
or-- or experimental technology.

10:53.069 --> 10:54.403
He's brilliant, isn't he?

10:54.487 --> 10:57.323
He's really brilliant. Is he single too?

10:57.406 --> 10:58.491
[scoffs]

10:59.617 --> 11:00.910
What if it's them?

11:02.411 --> 11:05.831
To build a machine like this,
you need resources.

11:05.915 --> 11:08.334
You need scientists, you need funding,

11:08.417 --> 11:10.169
-tens of millions of dollars.
-Joyce.

11:10.252 --> 11:12.755
It can't just be a coincidence, Hopper.

11:12.838 --> 11:13.798
It has to be them.

11:13.881 --> 11:14.840
Joyce, stop.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.217
It has to be the lab.

11:16.300 --> 11:17.426
It is impossible.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.553
-Well, then, prove it to me.
-Prove it?

11:19.637 --> 11:21.764
-Yeah, take me back there.
-To the lab.

11:21.847 --> 11:22.807
Yeah, I wanna go back.

11:22.890 --> 11:24.892
Because some magnets
fell off your fridge.

11:24.975 --> 11:25.810
Yes.

I'm a little busy right now,
bu t  maybe we can   meet up there,

11:36.320 --> 11:38.072
like tonight, like seven o'clock?

11:38.155 --> 11:40.783
You know, of course,
unless something comes up

11:40.866 --> 11:43.619
-which, you know, it will.
-You know,

11:44.120 --> 11:46.539
after everything that's happened,

11:46.622 --> 11:48.082
this is no joke.

11:48.165 --> 11:50.459
[Hopper] No, I don't think it's a joke.

11:50.543 --> 11:54.255
I think that when I asked you out,
I think you got scared.

11:55.047 --> 11:58.634
I think you got scared, and now,
you're inventing things.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.137
You're inventing things
to get worked up about

12:01.220 --> 12:04.098
so that you can push me away.

12:04.181 --> 12:06.559
Because God forbid

12:06.642 --> 12:08.144
any of us

12:08.477 --> 12:09.562
move on!

12:10.187 --> 12:11.439
Because that...

12:12.606 --> 12:13.774
that would be...

12:14.650 --> 12:17.194
[chuckles] I mean, that would be
too much, right, Joyce?

12:17.945 --> 12:18.904
You know?

12:19.280 --> 12:21.866
That would be too much,
wouldn't it, Joyce?

12:24.326 --> 12:25.703
Wouldn't it, Joyce?

12:30.416 --> 12:31.500
[distant crow squawks]

12:33.002 --> 12:33.961
Joyce?

12:36.088 --> 12:37.089
Joyce!

12:39.133 --> 12:41.677
-What the hell are you doing?
-I need to borrow these.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.554
No, you're not going back there.

12:43.971 --> 12:45.055
Joyce...

12:45.139 --> 12:48.184
-Joyce, you're not going back there...
-[car door opens]

12:48.768 --> 12:50.478
Son of a bitch!

12:50.561 --> 12:52.563
[thunder rumbling]

12:55.608 --> 12:57.067
[Max] It's gonna start pouring soon.

12:57.151 --> 12:59.945
We should be at the mall
or, like, watching a movie or something.

13:00.613 --> 13:01.822
You don't believe me?

13:02.656 --> 13:05.201
I believe you saw some
super weird stuff, totally,

13:05.618 --> 13:08.996
but you said Mike has
sensed you in there before, right?

13:10.456 --> 13:12.917
So maybe it was just like that.
Maybe Billy just...

13:13.000 --> 13:14.627
sensed you somehow.

13:16.128 --> 13:18.881
-But the screams.
-Yeah, I know, but here's the thing.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.051
When Billy is alone with a girl,

13:22.343 --> 13:24.595
they make, like, really crazy noises.

13:24.678 --> 13:27.723
-They scream?
-Yeah, but, like... happy screams.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.518
-Happy screams? What is happy screams?
-It's like...

13:31.519 --> 13:33.437
I'm just gonna lend you
my mom's  Cosmo.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.774
[Max] His car's not here.

13:39.443 --> 13:40.861
You really want to do this?

13:47.117 --> 13:50.037
Why do I get the feeling we're gonna find
all kinds of wrong in here?

13:50.120 --> 13:52.122
[heavy metal playing on stereo]

14:00.548 --> 14:01.382
[Max] Ugh!

14:01.465 --> 14:03.259
Gag me with a spoon.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.011
[door creaking]

14:15.104 --> 14:16.021
Max?

14:19.942 --> 14:21.777
[Max] Ice. It's just ice.

14:22.361 --> 14:25.364
Probably for his muscles or something.
He works out like a maniac.

14:25.447 --> 14:26.907
[trembling breaths]

14:39.587 --> 14:40.504
El, what is it?

14:53.684 --> 14:55.853
[trembling breaths]

15:00.149 --> 15:01.275
You sure about this?

15:01.567 --> 15:02.651
[chuckles]

15:03.319 --> 15:05.321
You really are your mother's son,
you know that?

15:05.404 --> 15:06.906
What's that supposed to mean?

15:07.323 --> 15:08.699
It means...

15:09.199 --> 15:10.367
you worry too much.

15:11.201 --> 15:13.078
-Huh.
-I got this, okay?

15:14.914 --> 15:15.748
Okay.

15:19.877 --> 15:23.172
So, what exactly are we looking at here?
Is this the Driscoll lady's stuff?

15:23.255 --> 15:25.674
No. No, see, that's the thing. I mean,

15:26.175 --> 15:28.677
listen, I thought she was crazy too, but--

15:28.761 --> 15:31.388
-She told me Johnson killed Kennedy.
-[men laugh]

15:31.472 --> 15:34.433
But, it turns out, she's not alone.

15:35.017 --> 15:38.103
Blackburn's Supply, Hawkins Farming,
the Crawleys,

15:38.187 --> 15:41.273
they've all had some supplies go missing,
all in the past few days.

15:41.357 --> 15:43.150
And it's not just fertilizer.

15:43.233 --> 15:46.612
It's pesticides, cleaning supplies,
diesel fuel.

15:46.695 --> 15:49.531
And that's just from one day
of calling around. I mean...

15:49.949 --> 15:50.824
there's gotta be more.

15:51.408 --> 15:54.286
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
Let me get this little...

15:54.954 --> 15:56.205
story of yours straight.

15:56.288 --> 15:59.833
So, little rodents have gone cuckoo
in their furry little minds

15:59.917 --> 16:02.002
and they're running around
the town of Hawkins,

16:02.086 --> 16:03.837
dining out on chemicals.

16:03.921 --> 16:06.340
I know how it sounds, but--

16:06.423 --> 16:07.508
But you've got proof!

16:07.591 --> 16:09.343
[men laugh]

16:09.426 --> 16:12.721
I mean, fellas, you gotta admit,
it's a hell of a headline, right?

16:12.805 --> 16:16.183
"Hawkins Rodents Prefer Poison:
Nutjob Tells All."

16:17.351 --> 16:19.269
-[Tom] Guys, that's enough.
-[laughter stops]

16:19.353 --> 16:20.688
I think this is...

16:21.814 --> 16:22.648
big.

16:22.731 --> 16:23.857
Bigger than one article.

16:23.941 --> 16:25.776
In fact,
I think this has got to be a book.

16:26.694 --> 16:28.570
The Mysterious Case
of the Missing Fertilizer,

16:28.654 --> 16:30.114
a Nancy Drew mystery.

16:30.197 --> 16:32.116
[men laugh]

16:34.159 --> 16:35.869
Next time a call comes in,

16:35.953 --> 16:37.496
do what you were hired for,

16:37.579 --> 16:38.789
and let us know, yeah?

16:38.872 --> 16:39.707
Ah...

16:39.790 --> 16:41.583
We'll decide what's a story
and what's not.

16:42.876 --> 16:43.752
Okay.

16:44.628 --> 16:47.047
-[men laugh]
-Bye-bye, Nancy Drew.

16:47.131 --> 16:49.174
Hey, it's okay. Nancy. Nancy!

16:49.258 --> 16:50.134
[bell dinging]

16:51.969 --> 16:54.346
-[man speaking Russian on headphones]
-Excuse me.

16:55.723 --> 16:56.682
Ahoy!

16:59.184 --> 17:00.227
[Robin sighs]

17:02.479 --> 17:03.647
[nautical tune playing]

17:05.149 --> 17:08.527
I'd like to try the peanut butter
chocolate swirl, please.

17:08.610 --> 17:10.571
No. No more samples today.

17:10.654 --> 17:11.905
Why not?

17:11.989 --> 17:13.949
Because you're abusing our company policy.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.868
Where's the sailor man?

17:15.951 --> 17:17.661
Sorry, he can't help you. He's busy.

17:17.745 --> 17:19.413
Busy with what?

17:21.707 --> 17:22.541
Spycraft.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.710
["Things Can Only Get Better" playing]

17:27.921 --> 17:29.006
[Dustin] You see anything?

17:29.423 --> 17:31.967
Uh, I guess I don't totally know
what I'm looking for.

17:32.676 --> 17:33.719
Evil Russians.

17:34.136 --> 17:36.764
Yeah, exactly. I don't know
what an evil Russian looks like.

17:36.847 --> 17:39.308
-Tall, blond, not smiling.
-Mm-hmm?

17:39.391 --> 17:40.434
Also, look for earpieces,

17:40.517 --> 17:41.977
camo, duffel bags,
that sort of thing.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.562
Right, okay, duffel bags.

17:46.190 --> 17:47.900
-Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.
-What?

17:47.983 --> 17:51.070
[Steve] Anna Jacobi's talking
with that meathead Mark Lewinsky.

17:51.153 --> 17:53.197
If you're not gonna focus,
just gimme the binoculars.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.365
Aw, Jesus Christ,
whatever happened to standards?

17:55.449 --> 17:58.077
[Steve] I mean,
Lewinsky never even came off the bench.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.621
Dude, you are the worst spy in history,
you know that?

18:00.871 --> 18:02.664
-Stop, hey. Stop.
-Give me those.

18:02.748 --> 18:06.126
I don't get why you're looking at girls.
You have the perfect one in front of you.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.587
-Seriously, if you say Robin again--
-Robin.

18:08.670 --> 18:10.547
-No, don't. No.
-Robin, Robin, Robin.

18:10.631 --> 18:11.924
-Stop, no, no, no.
-Robin. Robin.

18:12.007 --> 18:12.841
-Robin.
-No.

18:12.925 --> 18:13.759
-Robin.
-No!

18:13.842 --> 18:15.344
No, man, she's not my type.

18:15.427 --> 18:16.512
She's not even...

18:17.179 --> 18:19.473
in the ballpark of what my type is,
all right?

18:19.556 --> 18:21.809
What's your type again? Not awesome?

18:22.559 --> 18:24.019
-Thank you.
-Hm.

18:24.103 --> 18:27.231
For your information,
she's still in school. And she's weird.

18:27.397 --> 18:29.233
She's a weirdo. And she's hyper.

18:29.316 --> 18:30.651
I don't like that she's hyper.

18:30.734 --> 18:32.986
And she did drama.
That's a bad look.

18:33.070 --> 18:34.321
And she's in band?

18:35.030 --> 18:37.366
-No.
-Now that you're out of high school,

18:37.658 --> 18:40.828
which means you're technically an adult,
don't you think it's time you move on

18:40.911 --> 18:42.871
from primitive constructs
such as popularity?

18:42.955 --> 18:45.624
Oh, primitive constructs? That some
stupid shit you learned at Camp...

18:45.833 --> 18:46.959
Know... Nothing?

18:47.042 --> 18:48.168
Camp Know Where, actually.

18:48.252 --> 18:50.045
-And no, it's shit I learned from life.
-Hm.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.548
Instead of dating somebody
you think's gonna make you cooler,

18:52.631 --> 18:54.967
why not date somebody you actually enjoy
being around?

18:55.050 --> 18:56.301
Like me and Suzie.

18:56.385 --> 18:57.344
Oh, Suzie.

18:57.427 --> 18:59.680
Yeah, you mean,
"hotter than Phoebe Cates."

18:59.763 --> 19:00.806
Yeah, that Suzie.

19:00.889 --> 19:03.183
And, uh, let's think about

19:03.267 --> 19:06.562
how exactly did you score
that beautiful girlfriend?

19:07.354 --> 19:09.064
Oh, yeah. With my advice.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.692
Because that's how this works, Henderson.

19:11.775 --> 19:14.862
I give you the advice, you follow through.

19:14.945 --> 19:16.905
Not the other way around,
all right, pea-brain?

19:18.782 --> 19:20.284
[thunder rumbling]

19:23.495 --> 19:24.705
[Will] Do you guys hear that?

19:25.747 --> 19:27.541
It sounds like... thunder.

19:27.624 --> 19:28.625
[orchestral march playing]

19:28.709 --> 19:31.587
But, no, wait. That's not thunder.

19:31.670 --> 19:32.796
It's...

19:33.338 --> 19:34.965
a horde of juju zombies!

19:35.048 --> 19:36.758
Sir Mike, your action.

19:37.551 --> 19:38.510
What should I do?

19:39.386 --> 19:40.262
Attack?

19:40.345 --> 19:42.181
Okay, I attack with my flail.

19:42.264 --> 19:43.807
-[rolls dice]
-Whoosh!

19:43.891 --> 19:45.058
You miss.

19:45.142 --> 19:48.353
Your flail clanks the stone, the zombie
horde lumbers towards you, and...

19:50.022 --> 19:52.065
the juju bites your arm. Flesh tears!

19:52.149 --> 19:53.108
Aah!

19:53.192 --> 19:54.651
Seven points of damage.

19:54.735 --> 19:56.069
[sarcastically] Oh, no, my arm.

19:56.153 --> 19:58.530
-Lucas, look, my arm.
-[snickers]

19:59.656 --> 20:02.534
Sir Lucas, the zombie horde roars!

20:02.618 --> 20:05.329
Do you fight back or do you run?

20:06.663 --> 20:08.332
[phone ringing]

20:08.415 --> 20:09.750
No! It's a distraction!

20:09.833 --> 20:12.002
A trap. Do not answer it.

20:14.338 --> 20:15.172
What... No!

20:16.089 --> 20:16.924
El?

20:17.007 --> 20:17.966
[Mike] No.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.801
Sorry, not interested.

20:20.719 --> 20:21.720
Telemarketers.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.513
Maybe we should just call them.

20:24.014 --> 20:24.932
We can do that?

20:25.015 --> 20:27.059
-I think so.
-Yeah, but what would we say?

20:27.142 --> 20:29.728
We'll say nothing! The Khuisar tribe
still needs your help.

20:29.811 --> 20:30.938
All right, then.

20:31.021 --> 20:34.274
I'll use my torch to set fire
to the chambers, sacrificing ourselves,

20:34.358 --> 20:36.360
killing the jujus, and saving the Khuisar.

20:36.443 --> 20:39.196
We all live on as heroes
in the memories of the Kalamar.

20:39.780 --> 20:40.614
Victory.

20:41.323 --> 20:42.866
Okay. Fine.

20:43.492 --> 20:44.910
-You guys win.
-[music stops]

20:44.993 --> 20:47.120
-Congratulations.
-Will, I was just messing around.

20:48.664 --> 20:50.040
Hey, let's finish for real.

20:50.123 --> 20:52.584
-How much longer is the campaign?
-Just forget it, Mike.

20:52.668 --> 20:54.544
No, you want to keep playing, right?

20:54.628 --> 20:56.338
Y-Yeah, totally.

20:56.421 --> 20:59.424
-We'll just call the girls afterwards.
-I said forget it, Mike, okay?

20:59.925 --> 21:01.802
-I'm going home.
-But...

21:02.261 --> 21:03.470
-Come on, Will.
-Move!

21:07.683 --> 21:08.517
[sighs]

21:10.310 --> 21:11.436
[Mike] Will, come on.

21:11.812 --> 21:13.105
You can't leave. It's raining.

21:13.647 --> 21:15.148
Listen, I said I was sorry, all right?

21:15.816 --> 21:17.901
It's a cool campaign. It's really cool.

21:17.985 --> 21:20.904
-We're just not in the mood right now.
-Yeah, Mike. That's the problem.

21:20.988 --> 21:22.572
You guys are never in the mood anymore.

21:22.656 --> 21:24.866
-You're ruining our party.
-That's not true.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.952
Really? Where's Dustin right now?

21:27.619 --> 21:29.830
See? You don't know
and you don't even care.

21:29.913 --> 21:31.957
And obviously he doesn't either
and I don't blame him.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.042
You're destroying everything,
and for what?

21:34.126 --> 21:36.128
So you can swap spit
with some stupid girl?

21:36.211 --> 21:37.129
El's not stupid.

21:37.212 --> 21:39.131
It's not my fault you don't like girls.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.384
[thunder rumbling]

21:43.719 --> 21:46.305
I'm not trying to be a jerk. Okay?

21:47.097 --> 21:48.307
But we're not kids anymore.

21:48.890 --> 21:50.475
I mean, what did you think, really?

21:51.018 --> 21:52.853
That we were never gonna get girlfriends?

21:53.020 --> 21:54.730
We were just gonna sit
in my basement all day

21:54.813 --> 21:56.481
and play games for the rest of our lives?

21:57.065 --> 21:57.899
Yeah.

21:58.066 --> 21:58.942
[sniffles]

21:59.109 --> 22:00.152
I guess I did.

22:01.194 --> 22:02.362
I really did.

22:04.823 --> 22:05.699
Will.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.200
Will!

22:07.617 --> 22:09.161
Will, come on!

22:13.790 --> 22:15.667
[indistinct chatter]

22:18.337 --> 22:19.629
[kids laughing and squealing]
