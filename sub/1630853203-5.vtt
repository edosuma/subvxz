WEBVTT

00:07.920 --> 00:09.748
Previously on "61st Street..."

00:09.879 --> 00:11.402
Would it be possible to give me
a headline on those?

00:11.533 --> 00:13.274
The doctor's office
will contact you.

00:13.404 --> 00:15.754
Hands on the wall!

00:15.885 --> 00:18.540
See that? One day we gon' put
a bullet through both of 'em.

00:18.670 --> 00:20.020
How they know where to find me?

00:20.150 --> 00:21.369
They're going to come after us

00:21.499 --> 00:22.631
with everything they got,

00:22.761 --> 00:25.112
and it means you and me,
fighting this

00:25.242 --> 00:26.722
and fighting them.

00:26.852 --> 00:29.029
An olive branch is out there.

00:29.159 --> 00:30.900
All he got to do
is take it.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.336
Possible medical.

00:32.467 --> 00:33.598
Let me see your hands,
man! Come on!

00:33.729 --> 00:34.860
Show us your hands!

00:34.991 --> 00:36.688
Hands up, now!Show us your hands now!

00:38.603 --> 00:40.214
Then tell me
what happened.

00:45.175 --> 00:47.221
What happened,
girl?!

00:47.351 --> 00:48.483
What are they
doing here?

00:48.613 --> 00:50.398
What the heck
is going on?!

00:53.531 --> 00:55.011
David?

00:55.142 --> 00:56.230
Oh, thank God.

00:56.360 --> 00:58.841
Thank God.
Thank God.

00:58.971 --> 01:00.408
Are they still here?

01:00.538 --> 01:01.844
It's okay.

01:01.974 --> 01:04.412
You're safe, baby.
It's okay.

01:04.542 --> 01:05.848
I got lost.

01:05.978 --> 01:07.980
They found me
and brought me home.

01:40.230 --> 01:41.492
I see you! Guard!

01:41.623 --> 01:44.234
Guard! Guard!
Guard! Guard!

01:46.715 --> 01:48.760
Guard! Guard!

01:50.153 --> 01:51.241
No! No!

02:29.671 --> 02:31.325
You're not hearing me.
He was on fire.

02:31.455 --> 02:33.283
My cellmate
was on fire.

02:33.414 --> 02:34.719
I can still
smell him burning.

02:34.850 --> 02:38.114
It's in my nostrils.
It's -- It's in my clothes.

02:38.245 --> 02:39.550
You know what it was?

02:39.681 --> 02:41.291
Coffee creamer.

02:41.422 --> 02:43.511
Coffee creamer.
Okay,
take it easy.

02:43.641 --> 02:45.730
That was meant
for me!Okay.

02:45.861 --> 02:47.384
Who is
trying to kill me?

02:47.515 --> 02:49.517
5317,
you're up.

02:49.647 --> 02:52.346
Who is
trying to kill me?
Okay, take it easy.

02:52.476 --> 02:54.348
Is he dead?
I want you
to listen to me.

02:54.478 --> 02:55.653
No, they took him
to the hospital,

02:55.784 --> 02:57.351
a-and I don't know
if he dead or not --

02:57.481 --> 02:58.743
You need to focus,
Moses.

02:58.874 --> 03:00.310
Now.

03:00.441 --> 03:01.877
The state's attorney
made an offer.

03:02.007 --> 03:04.358
Let's go.
30 seconds,
please.

03:04.488 --> 03:06.360
If you plead guilty
to murder one,

03:06.490 --> 03:07.970
you'll do 20 years.20 years?

03:08.100 --> 03:09.189
That's it.
I didn't do --

03:09.319 --> 03:10.451
I didn't do this!
I know.

03:10.581 --> 03:11.713
I thought
you believed me, man.

03:11.843 --> 03:12.975
It's not about
what I believe.

03:13.105 --> 03:15.151
You have to make
a choice.

03:15.282 --> 03:16.544
You said they weren't
messing around

03:16.674 --> 03:17.980
with deals before,
so what changed?

03:18.110 --> 03:19.416
I think they're nervous
about something.

03:19.547 --> 03:20.852
CPD doesn't want
a trial.

03:20.983 --> 03:24.160
There's something they know
won't look good.

03:24.291 --> 03:25.640
So you're saying
I can get off?

03:25.770 --> 03:26.902
Okay,
wrap it up.

03:27.032 --> 03:28.164
Look,
I just need more time.

03:28.295 --> 03:29.774
Please.We don't do that here.

03:29.905 --> 03:32.342
Hold on. Hold on.
I got --
I got to decide now?

03:32.473 --> 03:34.997
Decide now.

03:35.127 --> 03:36.520
You been doing this
all your life,

03:36.651 --> 03:37.782
so you gonna have to tell me,
what do I do?

03:37.913 --> 03:39.219
Alright?
What do I do?

03:39.349 --> 03:41.482
Let's go.What do I do?

03:44.049 --> 03:46.400
Oh.

04:04.200 --> 04:06.028
Ma'am, you can't leave
that here.

04:06.158 --> 04:07.595
Y-You need to move.

04:07.725 --> 04:09.814
You need to move.

04:09.945 --> 04:12.948
Doing this to me
right now --

04:13.078 --> 04:15.124
Moses Johnson.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.257
Custody.

04:20.564 --> 04:22.262
Judge
Mr. Johnson, you have
the right to an attorney.

04:22.392 --> 04:23.567
You have the right
to remain silent.

04:23.698 --> 04:24.829
You have the right
to a jury trial.

04:24.960 --> 04:27.267
Do you understand?Yes, Your Honor.

04:27.397 --> 04:29.051
You're charged with one count
of murder in the first degree,

04:29.181 --> 04:30.879
a violation of Illinois
criminal code Section 9-1,

04:31.009 --> 04:32.402
a felony punishable

04:32.533 --> 04:34.448
by the maximum sentence
of life imprisonment.

04:34.578 --> 04:36.276
Do you understand?Yes, Your Honor.

04:36.406 --> 04:38.060
What'd he say?I don't know.

04:38.190 --> 04:41.281
Ms. Motherwell, a plea deal
at the eleventh hour.

04:41.411 --> 04:44.284
Thank you for keeping the court
on its toes, so to speak.

04:44.414 --> 04:46.286
What's the offer?20 years
for murder one.

04:46.416 --> 04:47.809
Has the defense had a chance
to review?

04:47.939 --> 04:50.290
W-We've had
a lot going on.

04:50.420 --> 04:52.857
Yes or no?
Yes.

04:52.988 --> 04:54.424
It's a hell of a deal.

04:54.555 --> 04:56.078
Ms. Motherwell?

04:56.208 --> 04:58.646
I said, "It's a hell of a deal,"
Your Honor.

04:58.776 --> 05:00.735
If you plead guilty,
you'll be sentenced

05:00.865 --> 05:02.084
to 20 years,
no more, no less.

05:02.214 --> 05:03.303
It means you'll be waiving
your right

05:03.433 --> 05:04.956
to defend yourself
in a jury trial.

05:05.087 --> 05:06.610
If you do go to trial
and a jury finds you guilty,

05:06.741 --> 05:07.916
you risk a sentence
of life without parole.

05:08.046 --> 05:09.352
Do you understand?

05:13.138 --> 05:15.358
Mr. Johnson?

05:18.927 --> 05:20.189
Yes,
Your Honor.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.060
So you're ready?

05:22.191 --> 05:23.497
How do you plead?

05:31.243 --> 05:32.723
I didn't do it.

05:32.854 --> 05:34.377
I need the words.

05:41.471 --> 05:43.691
I need the words.

05:45.649 --> 05:47.695
Not guilty.Not guilty.

05:50.045 --> 05:51.960
Not guilty.

05:56.791 --> 05:58.140
That's it?Yeah.

06:13.808 --> 06:14.939
Really?

06:15.070 --> 06:16.898
Is that coming from him
or from you?

06:34.306 --> 06:36.265
Franklin Roberts?

06:38.267 --> 06:40.748
Dr.
The cancer has spread

06:40.878 --> 06:43.533
from the prostate
into the bone.

06:43.664 --> 06:45.405
We found small tumors

06:45.535 --> 06:49.757
in your pelvis,
lower spine, and coccyx,

06:49.887 --> 06:52.281
which would explain the pain
you've been experiencing.

06:56.981 --> 06:58.940
Hmm.
Cancer of the tailbone.

06:59.070 --> 07:00.811
And the top
of the spine.

07:00.942 --> 07:02.987
You said that the tumors
were small.

07:03.118 --> 07:05.425
So does that mean that --
that we've caught it early?

07:05.555 --> 07:06.861
No.

07:06.991 --> 07:09.690
What your husband has
is considered advanced.

07:20.657 --> 07:22.616
How long?
Hard numbers.

07:22.746 --> 07:25.793
18 months is possible,
but not likely.

07:25.923 --> 07:29.231
There are
treatment options.

07:29.361 --> 07:32.016
ADT, testosterone
reduction therapy.

07:32.147 --> 07:33.844
We'll get you started
on that right away.

07:33.975 --> 07:37.239
I'm also prescribing alpha
blockers to relax your muscles,

07:37.369 --> 07:39.459
which should make it easier
to urinate --Any side effects?

07:39.589 --> 07:41.852
Stopping
testosterone production

07:41.983 --> 07:44.594
makes you more like
a woman, basically.

07:44.725 --> 07:47.031
That's the upside.

07:47.162 --> 07:49.643
Some fatigue.

07:49.773 --> 07:51.732
What kind of fatigue?

08:36.994 --> 08:38.256
Is he with you
right now?

08:38.387 --> 08:41.303
Hey, Marisol. Yes, he is.
It's not good.

08:41.433 --> 08:42.826
I'll issue a statement.

08:42.957 --> 08:44.698
You've got a family
health situation

08:44.828 --> 08:46.526
and need a moment
to work things out.

08:46.656 --> 08:48.528
Yeah.
What about the debate?

08:48.658 --> 08:50.181
I'll handle it.

08:50.312 --> 08:52.706
You don't show up for
the debate, you lose, Martha.

08:52.836 --> 08:54.838
It's over. What's he saying?

08:54.969 --> 08:56.144
Nothing.
He's not saying anything.

08:56.274 --> 08:58.189
What the hell?
What?

08:58.320 --> 08:59.582
What the hell?

08:59.713 --> 09:01.453
I'mma call you back.
I'll have to call you back.

09:01.584 --> 09:02.672
What are you
doing here?

09:02.803 --> 09:04.500
Franklin, what?

09:04.631 --> 09:06.546
Hey, man.
That shit is popping.One second.

09:06.676 --> 09:08.548
You need more, you know
how to get it.Franklin, what?

09:08.678 --> 09:10.158
What do you think
you're doing?

09:10.288 --> 09:12.464
What are you doing?

09:12.595 --> 09:15.555
What do you think
you're doing?

09:15.685 --> 09:17.861
What is this?

09:17.992 --> 09:19.602
Step off.
I'm talking to Calvin.Oh, yeah?

09:19.733 --> 09:22.083
You're a witness in a trial
that really, really matters.

09:22.213 --> 09:23.563
You have to be clean
to be believed,

09:23.693 --> 09:24.781
and you're out here
doing this?

09:24.912 --> 09:27.349
No.Move around, old man.

09:27.479 --> 09:29.786
Here.
I need Calvin clean.

09:29.917 --> 09:31.309
Please tell your boss.

09:31.440 --> 09:32.572
Move around.

09:32.702 --> 09:33.921
Please tell your boss.

09:34.051 --> 09:35.226
I'm moving.

09:35.357 --> 09:36.576
Thank you.

09:39.796 --> 09:41.929
Move!

09:42.059 --> 09:45.541
Move your car,
man!

09:45.672 --> 09:47.238
Who is he?

09:50.241 --> 09:51.591
What's up with him?

09:51.721 --> 09:53.593
My witness
is right there.

09:53.723 --> 09:56.944
I need him clean,
and he's -- Ahh.

09:57.074 --> 09:58.772
I'm not
gonna do it for you.

09:58.902 --> 10:00.556
What?
I'm not doing it.

10:00.687 --> 10:02.253
I'm not doing it.
I'm not doing it!
Doing what?

10:02.384 --> 10:04.734
I'm not telling David
that you're dying

10:04.865 --> 10:06.954
and that you'd rather spend
the rest of your days

10:07.084 --> 10:09.347
chasing after
these fools!

10:09.478 --> 10:11.785
Spending your time
with somebody else.

10:11.915 --> 10:13.961
That's up to you.
You do that.

10:14.091 --> 10:16.050
You do that.

10:18.313 --> 10:20.184
It's crazy,
right?

10:25.320 --> 10:26.626
Rey-Rey.

10:26.756 --> 10:27.975
Brannigan.

10:28.105 --> 10:29.411
What you doing here?

10:29.541 --> 10:30.978
You know
pigs don't eat chicken.

10:33.110 --> 10:34.634
You missed your calling,
Rey-Rey.

10:34.764 --> 10:36.897
You should have been
a comic.Yeah, yeah.

10:51.781 --> 10:54.828
Hello,
my friends.

10:54.958 --> 10:56.220
Squeeze!

10:56.351 --> 10:58.440
What's up,
man?

11:00.964 --> 11:03.227
Smells good, right?

11:03.358 --> 11:05.665
These guys make
the best fried chicken.

11:09.146 --> 11:11.105
Hey, bro.

11:14.891 --> 11:18.852
Squeeze, this is my associate,
Johnny.

11:18.982 --> 11:20.941
You got something
for me?

11:33.170 --> 11:35.085
Count it.

11:38.088 --> 11:39.699
It's all there.

11:46.793 --> 11:49.317
My man's gonna be in charge
of pickups from now on.

11:53.060 --> 11:54.670
Sure you can
handle that?

11:54.801 --> 11:56.280
Yeah.

11:56.411 --> 11:57.629
Squeeze is
your contact.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.719
You have any problems,
you go to him,

11:59.849 --> 12:01.851
and if you ever have
a half-hour to kill,

12:01.982 --> 12:03.635
ask him
how he got his name.

12:03.766 --> 12:05.725
It's a great story.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.817
Oh, I see how it is.

12:10.947 --> 12:12.906
Y'all don't got to wait on line
like everybody else, huh?

12:13.036 --> 12:14.168
And you don't even pay.

12:14.298 --> 12:16.083
You want free chicken,
Reynard?

12:16.213 --> 12:17.737
Submit an application.

12:17.867 --> 12:19.956
I hear they give felons
a second chance here.

12:20.087 --> 12:21.653
Ohhh.
That was a good one.

12:21.784 --> 12:22.916
Okay,
that was a good one.

12:23.046 --> 12:24.308
Hey, but you heard
about that cop

12:24.439 --> 12:26.180
getting his wig split
over on 61st Street?

12:26.310 --> 12:27.747
Yeah,
I heard about that.Yeah.

12:27.877 --> 12:30.706
They said his head
looked like a yard sale, man.

12:30.837 --> 12:32.926
Brains spilled all over
the curb and shit.

12:33.056 --> 12:35.102
You see,
karma's what you get...

12:35.232 --> 12:36.886
Logan!...when you ride around messing
with people all the damn time.

12:37.017 --> 12:38.670
Logan,
get in the car!

12:38.801 --> 12:40.237
Say it again.

12:40.368 --> 12:43.110
Squad, get me a couple cars
to 16th and Harper.

12:43.240 --> 12:45.416
Say it again!
Say it again!

12:45.547 --> 12:48.115
Say it again!
Say it again!

12:48.245 --> 12:51.074
Say it again!
Say it again!

12:51.205 --> 12:53.033
Say it again!

12:53.163 --> 12:54.295
That's enough!

12:54.425 --> 12:55.600
That is enough!

12:55.731 --> 12:57.777
Get off him!

12:57.907 --> 13:01.868
Hey!
What is --
Back up, jagoff!

13:01.998 --> 13:05.175
What are you doing?

13:05.306 --> 13:08.918
We are out here
wealth-building.

13:09.049 --> 13:11.921
Don't get distracted
by these knuckleheads.

13:18.928 --> 13:21.801
I'm sorry.

13:21.931 --> 13:23.541
Pull yourself together.

13:24.934 --> 13:27.589
You okay?

13:27.719 --> 13:29.852
Yeah, man.

13:39.514 --> 13:41.385
Ooh-ee.

13:41.516 --> 13:43.213
Another barbecue?

13:43.344 --> 13:46.303
Burn, baby, burn.
Yeah.

13:46.434 --> 13:47.652
Back off.

13:47.783 --> 13:50.830
When are you
gonna die?

13:50.960 --> 13:53.180
Next time, college boy!

13:57.575 --> 13:59.839
Hey, boy.
Better watch your step.

13:59.969 --> 14:01.405
They don't miss twice.Hey.

14:29.346 --> 14:30.870
Hell, no.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.219
Bro.
Bro, what's going on?

14:32.349 --> 14:33.742
Where you taking me,
bro?

14:33.873 --> 14:35.875
Where am I going?

14:36.005 --> 14:38.007
What y'all
got going on?

14:38.138 --> 14:39.313
Yo,
where the guard at?

14:39.443 --> 14:42.751
Where's the guard at?
Guard? Guard! Guard!

14:45.188 --> 14:49.236
No. No!
No! No! No!

14:54.154 --> 14:56.896
I'm giving you
the bottom bunk, son.

15:11.519 --> 15:13.086
Son.

15:13.216 --> 15:14.609
Dad?

15:14.739 --> 15:17.917
David,
we need to talk.

15:18.047 --> 15:20.571
I need -- I need
to tell you something.

15:20.702 --> 15:21.833
Is it important?

15:21.964 --> 15:23.226
Yes, it is.

15:23.357 --> 15:25.925
I'm so sorry.

15:26.055 --> 15:27.709
Here we go.
Okay.

15:27.839 --> 15:30.016
What letter
does it begin with?

15:30.146 --> 15:33.933
It begins with
a "C."

15:34.063 --> 15:36.109
Okay, Dad.
Make it a good one.

15:38.241 --> 15:40.026
Hmm.

15:44.247 --> 15:47.250
Actually,
I got one for you.

15:48.643 --> 15:51.515
Dad,
it's a "P" word.

15:54.518 --> 15:56.303
Penumbra.

15:58.696 --> 16:00.394
Ooh-ooh.

16:01.786 --> 16:03.527
Refresh my memory.

16:03.658 --> 16:06.748
It's basically when the Earth's
shadow is on the moon,

16:06.878 --> 16:07.967
on a full moon.

16:08.097 --> 16:10.882
Like,
it's like a shadow.

16:11.013 --> 16:13.276
So there's a penumbral lunar
eclipse that's tomorrow.

16:13.407 --> 16:15.148
Oh, wow.

16:15.278 --> 16:17.933
My favorite one,
'cause it's not obvious,

16:18.064 --> 16:21.154
so a lot of people think
it's just the full moon,

16:21.284 --> 16:23.983
but you got to look
for the Earth's shadow.

16:24.113 --> 16:27.247
A lot of people miss it,
but I don't.

16:27.377 --> 16:28.813
Wow.

16:28.944 --> 16:30.511
And I was hoping that would
go see it with me.

16:30.641 --> 16:33.209
Mm.

16:35.124 --> 16:36.299
Do you need
to think about it?

16:36.430 --> 16:37.997
Mm-hmm.

16:38.127 --> 16:39.911
Alright.
Yes.

16:40.042 --> 16:43.350
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, son.

16:43.480 --> 16:46.179
What was your "C" word,
Dad?

16:46.309 --> 16:48.485
Do you need to think
about this, too?

16:50.661 --> 16:52.359
Mm-hmm.

16:54.317 --> 16:56.189
Thank you,
baby.

17:00.149 --> 17:02.195
Oh, my baby.

17:11.987 --> 17:15.382
Pointing right at us.

17:15.512 --> 17:18.037
Have you ever seen anything
so perfect?

17:18.167 --> 17:19.560
I don't think so.

17:19.690 --> 17:21.518
Not at our PTA meetings,
huh?
Go for it.

17:21.649 --> 17:22.998
Go for it.
Go for it.Okay.

17:23.129 --> 17:25.044
I'm gonna check out
those buildings, yeah?

17:25.174 --> 17:26.654
A little...

17:26.784 --> 17:28.047
How's it going?

17:28.177 --> 17:30.614
How's it going?

17:30.745 --> 17:33.052
Well,
I'm a cop.

17:33.182 --> 17:34.662
Watched my partner die
in the street.

17:34.792 --> 17:36.142
I've been suspended
for doing my job.

17:36.272 --> 17:38.057
My hand hurts like hell,
and everybody hates us.

17:38.187 --> 17:40.059
Other than that,
I'm good.

17:40.189 --> 17:41.843
That's
Tara Trevolini's mom.

17:41.973 --> 17:43.845
She just got divorced.

17:43.975 --> 17:45.586
Did your mom
tell you that?

17:45.716 --> 17:47.327
I'm not allowed to repeat
what my mom says about her.

17:48.980 --> 17:50.417
Okay, well, I guess we don't
need to worry about

17:50.547 --> 17:52.854
Tara's mom showing up
at your party tonight.

17:52.984 --> 17:55.465
But you are,
right?

17:55.596 --> 17:57.554
Do I break promises
I make to you?

18:01.341 --> 18:04.083
Why don't you go ahead?
I'll catch up, okay?

18:21.404 --> 18:24.886
Hear you
Brannigan's new boy.

18:25.016 --> 18:28.324
The Nation
has an offer.

18:28.455 --> 18:31.284
If your crew takes they boots
off our necks,

18:31.414 --> 18:34.722
we can go five points
better than the Faction.

18:34.852 --> 18:36.419
Tell your boss.

18:55.830 --> 18:57.048
Hey, people.

18:57.179 --> 18:58.224
Hey, Franklin.

18:58.354 --> 19:00.965
Good to see you.

19:01.096 --> 19:03.229
How you doing,
baby?

19:03.359 --> 19:05.666
It was me,
and now it's you.

19:05.796 --> 19:07.929
I used to be the most
important person in his life.

19:08.059 --> 19:09.931
Now that's you.

19:10.061 --> 19:11.150
Coach Angelo.

19:11.280 --> 19:13.021
Coach Franklin.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.545
Let me tell you something
about Moses, okay?

19:15.676 --> 19:18.722
Everybody thinks the 400 is just
a long sprint -- which it is.

19:18.853 --> 19:20.855
But it's about pain,
too.

19:20.985 --> 19:22.944
The last 80 meters
hurt like hell,

19:23.074 --> 19:24.946
and then
it's about strength,

19:25.076 --> 19:26.469
and our man has that.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.950
I gave him that.

19:29.080 --> 19:30.908
Look at me with
my long-ass metaphors

19:31.039 --> 19:33.520
like I'm about to speak
a sermon or something, huh?

19:36.131 --> 19:37.437
Hey, Ms. Porter.

19:37.567 --> 19:39.395
I thought we were
gonna meet later.

19:39.526 --> 19:41.832
This couldn't wait.Alright, what's up?

19:41.963 --> 19:43.269
What's happening?

19:43.399 --> 19:45.358
A pro-bono lawyer still relying
on handouts

19:45.488 --> 19:47.142
from the community
to pay for what he's doing?

19:47.273 --> 19:49.100
Yeah, yeah.
That's the idea.

19:49.231 --> 19:51.625
He ever take a look
at where that money comes from?

19:53.801 --> 19:56.934
Well, he's at the barbecue
right now.

19:57.065 --> 19:58.806
We can walk over there
and you can ask him.

19:58.936 --> 20:02.505
Barbecue around the corner
from the corner?

20:02.636 --> 20:04.203
What corner?

20:04.333 --> 20:07.554
Open-air drug market where
Joshua Johnson makes his money.

20:07.684 --> 20:11.993
Money that pays for
his brother's legal team.

20:12.123 --> 20:13.429
Now, you know
I can't hear none --

20:13.560 --> 20:15.910
No,
you got to hear it.You know I can't.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.738
You -- You know I can't!
You know I can't hear that!

20:17.868 --> 20:19.130
You --
You gonna hear it

20:19.261 --> 20:22.351
and you can't unhear it,
Candidate Roberts.

20:22.482 --> 20:26.007
Moses' legal team being paid for
by the proceeds of crime.

20:26.137 --> 20:27.922
How'd that look
on your pro-bono husband?

20:28.052 --> 20:30.054
Janet --

20:30.185 --> 20:32.840
Ms. Porter.

20:32.970 --> 20:34.363
You can trust me.I'm trying to tr--

20:34.494 --> 20:35.843
You can trust me.

20:35.973 --> 20:37.714
I'm trying
to trust you,

20:37.845 --> 20:41.022
but don't let me catch you
with your shoes on.

20:41.152 --> 20:42.502
Why are you
doing this?

20:42.632 --> 20:44.808
I want you to give my son
the same attention

20:44.939 --> 20:48.029
that your husband and everybody
else is giving Moses.

20:48.159 --> 20:49.596
Or is Rufus' life
less valuable

20:49.726 --> 20:51.728
than
a scholarship boy's future?

21:11.705 --> 21:13.837
Hey, everyone.

21:13.968 --> 21:16.013
Guys, can I have your attention?

21:16.144 --> 21:19.060
Please. Uh...

21:19.190 --> 21:21.584
I know you were expecting
Barack and Michelle...

21:21.715 --> 21:24.283
...but I'm -- I'm hoping
that you'll allow me

21:24.413 --> 21:27.721
to just say a few words.

21:27.851 --> 21:29.462
Um...

21:29.592 --> 21:32.160
It feels like
just yesterday

21:32.291 --> 21:33.901
I was packing him up
for college.

21:37.208 --> 21:39.036
He was ready to take off.

21:41.430 --> 21:42.562
Sorry.It's okay.

21:42.692 --> 21:44.477
It's alright.

21:44.607 --> 21:45.869
It's alright.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.306
It's alright.

21:47.436 --> 21:49.133
You guys
know who Moses is.

21:49.264 --> 21:50.874
We do.

21:51.005 --> 21:52.311
Sorry.

21:52.441 --> 21:54.313
It's alright.Come on, now.

21:54.443 --> 21:57.316
It's alright.

21:57.446 --> 21:59.840
We are
who we walk with.

22:01.232 --> 22:04.323
The people
who surround us matter.

22:04.453 --> 22:05.846
Right! Tell us!

22:07.978 --> 22:13.244
They let everybody know,
"This is who I am."

22:13.375 --> 22:15.899
All of you
good people,

22:16.030 --> 22:18.119
I walk with you

22:18.249 --> 22:21.165
when we stand up
for Moses Johnson.

22:23.211 --> 22:26.432
And together, we're gonna
make sure the whole city --

22:26.562 --> 22:30.261
no, no, no --
the whole country

22:30.392 --> 22:34.265
is saying the name
Moses Johnson.

22:36.267 --> 22:39.009
Can you join me
in saying the name

22:39.140 --> 22:40.750
Moses Johnson?

22:40.881 --> 22:43.840
Will you say
Moses Johnson?

22:43.971 --> 22:45.538
Moses Johnson.Say!

22:45.668 --> 22:47.191
Moses Johnson.Say!

22:47.322 --> 22:49.890
Moses Johnson.Say it
like you mean it!

22:50.020 --> 22:51.544
Moses Johnson!Put your chest
in it!

22:51.674 --> 22:53.284
Moses Johnson!Y'all ain't serious!

22:53.415 --> 22:54.938
Moses Johnson!You ain't serious!

22:55.069 --> 22:56.723
Moses Johnson!That's so weak!

22:56.853 --> 22:58.551
Moses Johnson!Say!

22:58.681 --> 23:00.770
Moses Johnson.Say!

23:00.901 --> 23:02.729
Moses Johnson.Say!

23:02.859 --> 23:04.513
Moses Johnson.
Say!

23:04.644 --> 23:06.385
Moses Johnson.
Say!

23:17.091 --> 23:19.572
I got ya.
I got ya.

23:19.702 --> 23:20.877
Aah, no, no!

23:21.008 --> 23:23.576
Michael Jr.:
Come over here!

23:23.706 --> 23:26.013
Alright, you're a bad guy,
you're a bad guy.

23:26.143 --> 23:27.536
I'm the police chief,
and you're an officer.

23:27.667 --> 23:29.146
Can I be a bad guy?

23:29.277 --> 23:30.409
We already have enough.

23:30.539 --> 23:31.975
You never
let me play!

23:32.106 --> 23:34.413
Please!

23:34.543 --> 23:36.240
Fine, you be the cop
that wears the wire.

23:36.371 --> 23:37.633
What's a wire?

23:37.764 --> 23:39.592
It's, uh,
something secret

23:39.722 --> 23:41.158
people wear
under their clothes

23:41.289 --> 23:42.986
so nobody else
can see.

23:43.117 --> 23:45.032
Here,
lift up your shirt.

23:45.162 --> 23:46.773
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
No, no, no.

23:46.903 --> 23:48.427
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
No, no.

23:48.557 --> 23:50.211
No,
it's not safe.

23:50.341 --> 23:53.432
We're not putting anything
around your neck.

23:53.562 --> 23:55.390
Play safe.

24:10.927 --> 24:13.408
Where do you think a kid
like Michael Jr.

24:13.539 --> 24:15.236
would get
something like that?

24:21.677 --> 24:24.071
Cop with a wire?

24:26.247 --> 24:28.815
I have an idea
of where he heard it.

24:28.945 --> 24:30.643
I thought you might.

24:34.951 --> 24:37.258
Michael Rossi was wearing
a wire when he died.

24:39.782 --> 24:43.656
I opened his shirt
for CPR,

24:43.786 --> 24:45.658
and there's
a damn wire.

24:45.788 --> 24:49.052
And Michael never kept secrets,
never, ever, so...

24:49.183 --> 24:51.490
I gotta tell you,
when I saw that, I panicked.

24:54.971 --> 24:56.495
So I pocketed it.

24:56.625 --> 24:59.236
And you're just
telling me now?

24:59.367 --> 25:03.066
Remember what happened
to Jerry Finnegan from SOS?

25:03.197 --> 25:04.372
Where'd you put it?

25:04.503 --> 25:06.287
It's gone.
I got rid of it.

25:06.417 --> 25:09.072
Don't feed me shit
and call it sugar, Logan.

25:13.729 --> 25:15.992
You saw
a wire on your partner's chest

25:16.123 --> 25:17.428
and didn't get curious?

25:24.087 --> 25:27.090
Over there is a family
whose dad died a hero.

25:27.221 --> 25:28.831
I-I don't want
to mess with that.

25:32.400 --> 25:33.793
Whatever secrets were
on that tape,

25:33.923 --> 25:35.098
Michael Rossi
was lucky enough

25:35.229 --> 25:36.665
to take them with him
to his grave.

25:36.796 --> 25:38.711
That's where they belong.

25:38.841 --> 25:40.800
In the ground.

25:46.109 --> 25:47.850
What are yoursecrets,
Logan?

25:50.940 --> 25:53.726
Someone paid me
a visit.

25:53.856 --> 25:56.163
Someone?

25:56.293 --> 25:58.731
Dante.

25:58.861 --> 26:00.733
He's offering five points
above the Faction.

26:00.863 --> 26:02.386
Said I'd pass on
the message.

26:19.229 --> 26:21.797
Tell me about this white girl
I keep seeing.

26:21.928 --> 26:23.190
Lawyer.
Sharp mind.

26:23.320 --> 26:24.887
Not afraid of anything
or anyone.

26:25.018 --> 26:27.890
Brutally honest.
Yeah,
but who is she?

26:28.021 --> 26:30.545
Come to think of it,
I-I-I don't really know.

26:30.676 --> 26:32.068
That means it's working.

26:32.199 --> 26:33.592
Put a story out there,
and people listening --

26:33.722 --> 26:34.941
including white people.

26:35.071 --> 26:37.160
I'll tell you
one thing --

26:37.291 --> 26:39.336
I would not want to be
on her bad side.

26:39.467 --> 26:42.426
Mm.

26:42.557 --> 26:43.645
Mrs. Johnson.

26:43.776 --> 26:45.125
I'm Nicole Carter,
staff attorney

26:45.255 --> 26:46.953
with the
Upright Justice Project.

26:47.083 --> 26:48.519
Oh, good to meet you,
Nicole.

26:48.650 --> 26:50.826
Franklin here was just
talking about you.

26:50.957 --> 26:53.786
Oh.
And what were you saying?

26:53.916 --> 26:55.788
I should
let you two catch up.

26:59.313 --> 27:01.141
I know
what you're thinking.You do?

27:01.271 --> 27:03.143
What gives me the right
to move in on this?

27:03.273 --> 27:05.145
I was kind of hoping
that you were an angel.

27:05.275 --> 27:07.626
A little disappointed that
you're just another lawyer.

27:07.756 --> 27:10.803
Sorry.
Eh.

27:10.933 --> 27:12.500
I know
how to help you.

27:12.631 --> 27:13.762
Really?

27:13.893 --> 27:15.372
Yes.

27:15.503 --> 27:16.809
How old are you?

27:16.939 --> 27:18.419
27.

27:18.549 --> 27:19.725
How old are you?

27:19.855 --> 27:21.074
Really not sure anymore,

27:21.204 --> 27:23.816
but I'm feeling
a whole lot younger now.

27:23.946 --> 27:27.428
All this --
this movement...

27:27.558 --> 27:29.735
this moment.

27:29.865 --> 27:32.912
It's exciting.

27:44.793 --> 27:46.534
Come on. Look out, a'ight?
I'm just gonna go.

27:46.665 --> 27:48.667
Love you. Enjoy.Love you, too.

27:48.797 --> 27:51.844
That your boy?
Yep,
that's my Joshua.

27:51.974 --> 27:53.628
My Jojo.

27:53.759 --> 27:55.369
Yeah,
he seems like a great kid.

27:58.154 --> 27:59.460
You married?

27:59.590 --> 28:00.853
Uh, no.

28:00.983 --> 28:03.594
No.
No.

28:03.725 --> 28:05.640
Girlfriend?
No.

28:05.771 --> 28:07.120
Franklin.

28:07.250 --> 28:08.991
I-I know who you are,

28:09.122 --> 28:11.472
and we need
more brothers in law like you.

28:11.602 --> 28:13.300
Have we met?

28:13.430 --> 28:15.476
What do you do?

28:15.606 --> 28:18.653
I'm a plumber by day
and an activist by night.

28:18.784 --> 28:22.744
You got a van?Wow.

28:22.875 --> 28:24.050
You married?

28:24.180 --> 28:25.486
Uh,
I am married, yes.

28:25.616 --> 28:27.009
Oh. Girlfriend?

28:27.140 --> 28:28.271
Who do you think
I am?

28:28.402 --> 28:30.056
Who would you
like to be?

28:35.365 --> 28:36.671
How's the young'un doing?

28:36.802 --> 28:38.064
You know
how boys are.

28:38.194 --> 28:40.109
They don't want their moms
to worry.

28:40.240 --> 28:41.894
That's good.

28:42.024 --> 28:43.460
Is it?

28:43.591 --> 28:45.027
Well, being brave for his mama
gives him, you know,

28:45.158 --> 28:46.855
something
to hold on to.

28:46.986 --> 28:48.509
Keeps Moses
being Moses.

28:48.639 --> 28:50.729
How do you know him?

28:50.859 --> 28:53.819
I don't,
but I feel like I do,

28:53.949 --> 28:56.082
which is why I'm here.

28:56.212 --> 28:57.866
Look, I don't want to seem
out of pocket or nothing,

28:57.997 --> 29:00.086
but, um --

29:00.216 --> 29:02.958
I'm-a give you
my number.

29:06.440 --> 29:08.485
If I can help you
with anything,

29:08.616 --> 29:10.313
hit me up.

29:33.249 --> 29:35.774
Easy now.

29:35.904 --> 29:37.297
You're working
with an injury.

29:37.427 --> 29:38.733
Oh, it's fine.

29:38.864 --> 29:40.779
Let me see it.
It's fine.

29:40.909 --> 29:43.042
Just let me.
It's not
as bad as it looks.

29:50.136 --> 29:52.355
She's asleep.
I'll check on the boys.

29:52.486 --> 29:54.227
Thank you.

30:05.673 --> 30:08.676
Michael counted the steps
with each of them every night.

30:11.853 --> 30:14.029
She'll never know that.

30:18.947 --> 30:20.514
Just rip it --
Ahh.

30:26.476 --> 30:29.175
Look, who's to say
what's the right

30:29.305 --> 30:30.611
or wrong way
to deal with this.

30:30.741 --> 30:32.656
There...

30:32.787 --> 30:35.137
There isn't one.

30:35.268 --> 30:36.835
But you can't take it
on the streets.

30:36.965 --> 30:38.837
It's just a messed-up day,
that's all.

30:38.967 --> 30:41.187
10 years with Michael,
and I don't ever remember

30:41.317 --> 30:44.451
there being a brawl like this
in the daylight.

30:44.581 --> 30:48.890
Yeah, well, Michael --
had a way with people.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.416
This new group
you're working with,

30:53.547 --> 30:57.072
they -- they have
a way with people?

30:57.203 --> 30:59.683
I don't get to choose
my partners, Jessica.

31:03.905 --> 31:06.865
Well,
just be really careful,

31:06.995 --> 31:10.129
'cause I can't
take another hit.

31:34.501 --> 31:36.720
Forgot my sunglasses.

31:52.519 --> 31:56.262
Jessica,
I think, um --

31:56.392 --> 31:59.961
I think -- I think
you should take this.

32:02.137 --> 32:04.748
I don't think I should have this
in my possession anymore.

32:10.841 --> 32:12.365
Is this --
It's Michael's.

32:22.679 --> 32:24.290
Do you know
what that is?

32:24.420 --> 32:25.552
A camera?

32:25.682 --> 32:27.293
It's a ShotSpotter.

32:27.423 --> 32:28.859
Only it doesn't spot.

32:28.990 --> 32:30.513
It listens.

32:33.603 --> 32:35.954
Why did the state's attorney
offer us a deal

32:36.084 --> 32:37.303
when a week ago,

32:37.433 --> 32:39.392
they wouldn't
even come to the table?

32:42.003 --> 32:44.963
Moses said
they shot at him.

32:45.093 --> 32:47.922
CPD said they didn't.

32:48.053 --> 32:49.576
My son wouldn't lie.

32:49.706 --> 32:51.273
Not his style.

33:01.327 --> 33:02.763
Yo, fool.

33:02.893 --> 33:04.460
Step aside
for Lil' Speak.

33:04.591 --> 33:06.201
No, man,
it's alright.

33:06.332 --> 33:09.204
You ain't got to --Table 7
got your name on it.

33:11.467 --> 33:14.427
Let him through.
Let him through.

33:14.557 --> 33:16.081
My bad, y'all.

33:35.404 --> 33:37.928
Hey, let me
talk to him --

33:49.070 --> 33:52.030
Can't let you
go hungry.

33:52.160 --> 33:53.466
Sit down,
son.

33:53.596 --> 33:55.859
'Cause if I don't,
it'll make you look bad?

33:55.990 --> 33:57.687
Sit down.

34:05.913 --> 34:07.219
Eat your protein.

34:07.349 --> 34:08.742
You gon' need it.

34:08.872 --> 34:10.309
You know, for the last
three years,

34:10.439 --> 34:13.225
Coach Angelo had me
on a designed diet for my body,

34:13.355 --> 34:16.184
for me to be the best athlete
I can be.

34:16.315 --> 34:19.057
And Ma, you know,
she scrimps and she saves,

34:19.187 --> 34:21.581
walks miles for me
to get what I need.

34:21.711 --> 34:23.104
How many years
you been gone, bro?

34:23.235 --> 34:25.585
You gonna talk about,
"Eat your protein."

34:25.715 --> 34:27.456
Nah.

34:27.587 --> 34:28.849
I'm good.

34:28.979 --> 34:31.721
You want to know
who tried to kill you?

34:34.115 --> 34:37.075
Guards working
with the Faction.

34:37.205 --> 34:40.078
Juice like that
combined?

34:40.208 --> 34:42.863
You don't show the world
you got our protection,

34:42.993 --> 34:44.517
you're dead.

34:59.619 --> 35:01.229
Eat your protein.

35:14.460 --> 35:15.896
Okay.

35:16.026 --> 35:17.463
I want you
to act it out for me.

35:17.593 --> 35:18.638
Show me
where everybody was.

35:18.768 --> 35:20.335
A'ight. I'm here.Uh-huh.

35:20.466 --> 35:21.945
Moses is there.
Uh-huh.

35:22.076 --> 35:23.904
And the first cop went down
right where you're standing.

35:24.034 --> 35:26.472
Here?
The second officer?

35:26.602 --> 35:27.951
He came
from that way,

35:28.082 --> 35:30.302
running out his car
with his piece out.

35:30.432 --> 35:32.130
Why would he have
his weapon drawn

35:32.260 --> 35:33.479
if he didn't know
what he was coming into?

35:33.609 --> 35:35.916
CPD need a reason?

35:36.046 --> 35:37.961
Pig tells Moses,
"Don't move.

35:38.092 --> 35:39.963
Face the wall."
Same old nonsense.

35:40.094 --> 35:42.662
So Moses turns,
but then he runs up the wall

35:42.792 --> 35:44.620
like a damn superhero.

35:44.751 --> 35:48.146
Pig got mad
and took a shot.

35:48.276 --> 35:50.365
He shot at Moses
while Moses was fleeing?

35:50.496 --> 35:51.627
That --
That don't make no sense.

35:51.758 --> 35:52.889
Now, you --
you sure about that?

35:53.020 --> 35:54.935
I wasn't
but 20 feet away.

35:55.065 --> 35:57.285
One shot.

35:57.416 --> 35:58.721
Mm.

35:58.852 --> 36:01.507
Okay. Okay.

36:01.637 --> 36:03.726
Okay.

36:03.857 --> 36:05.728
Alright.

36:08.122 --> 36:09.471
Where's the bullet?

36:09.602 --> 36:10.951
Where's --
Where's the hole?
No, man.

36:11.081 --> 36:13.171
You got the picture
all wrong.What?

36:13.301 --> 36:15.303
Moses was up there when
the cop took a shot -- on top.

36:15.434 --> 36:17.740
Cop aimed up
like this.

36:22.310 --> 36:23.746
Huh.

36:23.877 --> 36:25.357
Oh.

36:27.881 --> 36:31.189
Get the -- Get that ladder
for me, could you?

36:31.319 --> 36:32.407
Could you
get that ladder?

36:44.898 --> 36:46.029
Oh.

36:46.160 --> 36:47.379
You alright?

36:47.509 --> 36:49.076
Yeah.

37:04.091 --> 37:06.006
Careful, man.

37:13.535 --> 37:16.234
So,
Moses was here

37:16.364 --> 37:19.541
when the second officer
shot at him, right?

37:19.672 --> 37:21.239
Uh-huh.

37:21.369 --> 37:22.849
Okay.

37:22.979 --> 37:26.592
And the bullet,
out there.

37:26.722 --> 37:28.637
It's out there.

37:31.379 --> 37:33.076
Bullet's gone,
man.

37:33.207 --> 37:34.817
It's long gone.

37:39.344 --> 37:42.085
Calvin,
can you see the moon?

37:42.216 --> 37:45.480
Uh-huh.

37:45.611 --> 37:50.790
Most people miss it,
but we won't.

37:50.920 --> 37:53.227
Miss what?

37:53.358 --> 37:55.621
Penumbral.

37:59.973 --> 38:03.019
The new development I'm backing
brings new money in,

38:03.150 --> 38:06.109
and new money means jobs,
and jobs means that --

38:06.240 --> 38:08.851
I would like to ask
my opponent a question, please.

38:08.982 --> 38:10.897
Okay, sure.
Councilor?

38:11.027 --> 38:13.900
Yeah, do you know
the name Rufus Porter?

38:14.030 --> 38:16.424
No.
I don't know Rufus Porter.

38:16.555 --> 38:18.470
Yeah,
he was a child

38:18.600 --> 38:21.908
who was shot
by the police in our ward,

38:22.038 --> 38:23.605
and you don't know
his name.

38:25.868 --> 38:28.567
I don't think it's because
you don't care.

38:28.697 --> 38:32.527
I think it's because...
you stopped listening.

38:32.658 --> 38:36.705
Because there are too many
Rufus Porters to remember.

38:36.836 --> 38:38.054
See,
I don't want the cop

38:38.185 --> 38:41.188
who shot Rufus Porter
to go to trial.

38:41.319 --> 38:43.451
I don't want
the justice system

38:43.582 --> 38:46.367
to lean into prosecuting
police officers.

38:46.498 --> 38:48.500
I'm not interested
in reform.

38:48.630 --> 38:52.504
The -- The origins
of -- of policing in America

38:52.634 --> 38:57.335
began as slave-catching
on plantations.

38:57.465 --> 38:59.511
You cannot
reform a system

38:59.641 --> 39:01.730
that is functioning
as it should.

39:01.861 --> 39:04.559
You have to scrap
the whole thing!

39:04.690 --> 39:07.345
If you are part of
this justice system

39:07.475 --> 39:10.957
that is locking our people up,
shame on you!

39:13.786 --> 39:15.701
Shame on all of you.

40:11.060 --> 40:15.151
I found a spot on top
of a couple containers,

40:15.282 --> 40:19.982
so I had a great view
of the night sky.

40:20.113 --> 40:21.375
And you're right,
though --

40:21.506 --> 40:25.597
you got to know
where and how to look.

40:27.686 --> 40:31.994
But when you do, oh.

40:32.125 --> 40:35.215
It is so beautiful.

40:35.345 --> 40:37.913
So beautiful.

40:38.044 --> 40:39.611
When is
the next one, David?

40:42.352 --> 40:44.442
Four --
five years from now.

40:44.572 --> 40:46.618
Maybe we can watch it together
this time.

40:53.712 --> 40:55.627
Good night,
Dad.

40:55.757 --> 40:57.629
Night.

41:13.601 --> 41:15.995
20 years,
and you said no.

41:16.125 --> 41:18.301
20 years is
damn near a vacation.

41:20.565 --> 41:23.306
What,
is that it?

41:23.437 --> 41:25.961
That's all you got to say?
That's your advice, Speak?

41:28.703 --> 41:30.052
Don't call me Speak.

41:30.183 --> 41:31.837
Why?

41:31.967 --> 41:33.665
You're not my dad.

41:33.795 --> 41:35.405
You ain't been
for a long time.

41:51.334 --> 41:54.642
Your lawyer telling you
to fight, giving you hope.

41:54.773 --> 41:57.079
Hope kills.

41:57.210 --> 41:59.125
You got
to get rid of that.

41:59.255 --> 42:00.735
When will you learn,
huh?

42:00.866 --> 42:05.131
In a fight like this,
we don't win.

42:05.261 --> 42:06.915
Whatever, man.

42:31.766 --> 42:33.507
On the next episode of
"61st Street..."

42:33.638 --> 42:35.204
That offer that's on the table,
it needs an answer.

42:35.335 --> 42:38.338
Did Michael Rossi tell you
he was looking into me?

42:38.468 --> 42:40.209
I see who you are.
You and your husband

42:40.340 --> 42:41.863
ain't no better
than the rest of them.

42:41.994 --> 42:44.039
A woman called in
a gunshot from her home address

42:44.170 --> 42:45.432
on 73rd Street.

42:45.563 --> 42:47.434
Your wise-ass lawyer
is selling you something

42:47.565 --> 42:49.088
worse than dreams --
hope.

42:49.218 --> 42:52.265
This is how we win --
telling it like it is.

42:52.395 --> 42:54.049
I can't do this.
