WEBVTT

00:00.583 --> 00:02.921
And so, after six months apart,

00:02.932 --> 00:05.656
Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall
were finally back together.

00:05.667 --> 00:07.092
Oh, my God.

00:07.596 --> 00:09.599
These pancakes are delicious!

00:09.610 --> 00:10.912
Yes. Thank you.

00:10.923 --> 00:12.954
Um, I learned how to cook while
you were gone this summer.

00:12.984 --> 00:15.748
Oh. Do you want to
cook dinner tonight?

00:15.774 --> 00:17.963
Yeah, sure.

00:18.404 --> 00:20.092
How about pancakes?

00:20.705 --> 00:23.350
And things were back
to normal... almost.

00:23.363 --> 00:25.861
You may not have much range,
but at least I'm marrying a guy

00:25.877 --> 00:28.083
who knows how to make pancakes.

00:31.469 --> 00:33.072
Oh, um...

00:33.129 --> 00:34.662
I mean, um...

00:35.026 --> 00:39.190
Well, I... I realize that we
haven't really discussed

00:39.205 --> 00:43.430
whether us getting back together
means us getting married, but...

00:43.888 --> 00:45.633
I still wanna.

00:45.648 --> 00:47.450
Do you still wanna?

00:47.557 --> 00:49.210
Really?

00:50.377 --> 00:52.202
Of course, I love you.

00:52.218 --> 00:54.513
No, I mean,
that's how you're gonna do it?

00:54.528 --> 00:58.653
"Do you still wanna?" That's
like the lamest proposal ever.

00:58.685 --> 01:02.763
When I did it, I got down on my knees...
I don't know, I'm just saying.

01:06.058 --> 01:09.162
Marshall Eriksen,
will you ma...

01:09.176 --> 01:11.341
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- What?!

01:11.366 --> 01:14.002
You can't lead with that.
You got to... build up to that.

01:14.015 --> 01:16.700
You got to have,
like, a little speech.

01:16.715 --> 01:19.551
Do you remember your
proposal to me?

01:20.087 --> 01:22.561
I had a speech prepared.

01:22.578 --> 01:24.572
What do you want to hear?

01:24.587 --> 01:27.063
I don't know.
I mean, you could tell me,

01:27.087 --> 01:31.850
like, about how good-looking
and funny and smart I am

01:31.868 --> 01:33.383
and I've been
working out lately.

01:33.395 --> 01:37.682
It might be nice for you to
mention something... about that.

01:38.448 --> 01:40.213
Marshall...

01:40.225 --> 01:43.111
- you are good-looking...
- Thank you.

01:43.126 --> 01:44.563
- You're funny.
- Oh, thanks.

01:44.585 --> 01:46.371
- You're smart.
- And a few tears wouldn't hurt.

01:46.408 --> 01:48.203
Okay, would you freakin'
marry me already?

01:48.215 --> 01:50.422
I'll marry you. Of course.

01:50.436 --> 01:54.890
But, um, until you see a ring on this
finger, don't expect me to put out.

01:54.908 --> 01:56.851
Yeah, right.

I'll give you this.

02:19.537 --> 02:22.122
That was a very
creative use of syrup.

02:23.287 --> 02:26.612
I can't even look Mrs.
Butterworth in the eye.

02:29.266 --> 02:32.151
Oh, my God.
We're getting married!

02:32.168 --> 02:33.880
I know, I know.

02:34.418 --> 02:36.411
It was a moment of happiness,

02:36.428 --> 02:39.292
followed of course by a
moment of total panic.

02:39.305 --> 02:41.411
See, when they called
off their first wedding,

02:41.427 --> 02:43.722
Aunt Lily took off
for San Francisco

02:43.737 --> 02:46.093
leaving Uncle Marshall
with the unfortunate task

02:46.107 --> 02:47.863
of telling his entire family.

02:47.878 --> 02:50.841
Yeah, so now she's gone
and the wedding's off.

02:50.918 --> 02:53.233
What do you call someone who just
takes off and leaves like that?

02:53.266 --> 02:54.722
What do you call that?

02:56.058 --> 02:58.432
I think that that's
a little strong.

02:58.455 --> 03:01.581
I can't even believe you
would use a word like that.

03:01.595 --> 03:03.502
Geez, Grandma.

03:04.978 --> 03:08.911
Man, I made a big mess by
canceling this wedding, didn't I?

03:08.926 --> 03:10.873
It's okay, baby.

03:11.477 --> 03:14.131
You're not just realizing that now,
are you?

03:15.547 --> 03:19.262
God, the idea of standing up
there in front of all those people

03:19.275 --> 03:21.160
who hate my guts...

03:21.175 --> 03:25.432
just makes me want to run off to
Atlantic City and get married today.

03:25.447 --> 03:26.950
Yeah.

03:29.277 --> 03:33.403
Coming up at 11:00:
Are there piranhas in the East River?

03:33.418 --> 03:37.252
What you don't know...
could eat you.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.512
Robin! Stop the news!

03:39.538 --> 03:41.640
- What the hell? 
- It's okay. They're my friends.

03:41.657 --> 03:44.501
We're going to Atlantic City to elope.
You got to come with us.

03:44.518 --> 03:46.492
Oh, my God,
that is so fantastic!

03:46.506 --> 03:48.391
I-I don't know if I
can just leave work.

03:48.406 --> 03:51.022
It's okay;
Mike can read the news tonight.

03:51.037 --> 03:54.122
Hey, Mike...
you can read, right?

03:54.248 --> 03:56.530
Yeah, I'm the best at reading.

03:57.216 --> 03:59.690
-  Let's go to Atlantic City!
- Yeah!

04:01.318 --> 04:04.862
You guys are eloping!
Oh, that's fantastic.

04:04.875 --> 04:07.632
Wait, is this because there's a time
crunch Uncle Ted should know about?

04:07.665 --> 04:10.541
I hope not because I plan
on getting hammered.

04:10.757 --> 04:13.863
Guys, this sounds like so much fun,
but I can't really take off work.

04:13.876 --> 04:16.591
I'm kind of important around here,
you know? I'm the project manager.

04:16.625 --> 04:18.601
Ted, for the rest of our lives,

04:18.616 --> 04:20.793
we are going to be
telling the amazing story

04:20.805 --> 04:23.472
of how we went to Atlantic
City and got married.

04:23.485 --> 04:25.992
Don't you want to
be in that story?

04:26.107 --> 04:27.480
Of course I do.

04:27.497 --> 04:29.292
- Let's go to Atlantic City!
- Yeah!

04:29.626 --> 04:32.581
Oh, but when we tell the story, can you
leave out the part where I hesitate?

04:32.618 --> 04:34.071
You got it.

04:36.257 --> 04:37.903
Hey, guys.

04:38.267 --> 04:40.632
Wow. A pedicure.

04:40.647 --> 04:43.461
Uh, if there were any shame
in a dude getting a pedicure

04:43.477 --> 04:47.641
I don't think there would have been a
feature about it in Details magazine.

04:47.956 --> 04:51.390
We're going to Atlantic
City to elope right now!

04:51.407 --> 04:53.801
Oh, congratulations, Lily.

04:53.818 --> 04:56.760
Marshall, you're getting married?
What the hell?

04:56.775 --> 04:58.730
So are you in or not?

04:58.745 --> 05:00.180
Hell, yeah, I'm in!

05:00.197 --> 05:01.710
Just... I'm almost done.

05:01.727 --> 05:04.532
- No, we got to get going to the...
- Well, actually, I mean...

05:04.546 --> 05:07.683
It is my wedding day,
and since we're here...

05:08.747 --> 05:12.251
So we all got a pedicure
and then headed down...

05:12.265 --> 05:14.562
to Atlantic City.

05:21.028 --> 05:24.290
Wow. Look at this place.

05:24.307 --> 05:26.562
I guess I'll have my
pick of something old.

05:26.585 --> 05:29.942
And something blue. Somebody
should really check on this lady.

05:30.768 --> 05:34.263
Ah, A.C., always in decline,

05:34.278 --> 05:35.943
never hitting bottom.

05:35.957 --> 05:38.202
It's good to be back,
old friend.

05:38.215 --> 05:39.652
You been here before?

05:39.665 --> 05:41.310
Oh, uh, once or twice.

05:41.326 --> 05:42.650
Barney!

05:43.295 --> 05:45.502
Ah, good to see you, too.

05:45.848 --> 05:47.692
Three times, maybe.

05:48.357 --> 05:50.542
The wedding chapel--
this is it.

05:50.556 --> 05:52.362
Are you ready to do this?

05:52.375 --> 05:53.761
I'm ready.

05:54.025 --> 05:56.003
- Let's get married.
- Yeah.

05:56.105 --> 05:58.441
Oh, crap. I don't have a veil.

05:58.456 --> 06:01.381
I'm a bride;
I can't get married without a veil.

06:01.396 --> 06:04.290
And a bouquet.
I need a veil and a bouquet.

06:04.308 --> 06:06.832
Oh, my God,
we're getting married.

06:06.846 --> 06:09.123
Don't worry. Relax.
We'll get you a veil, honey.

06:09.135 --> 06:11.481
Oh,  Robin,
that's a really cute outfit.

06:11.495 --> 06:12.730
Oh, really? Thanks.

06:12.746 --> 06:15.570
Yeah, it has to go. I'm the bride;
you can't look better than me.

06:15.585 --> 06:16.820
Done.

06:16.905 --> 06:19.811
I'm  going to get the bouquet.
You guys get the veil.

06:19.827 --> 06:21.881
We'll meet in the
chapel in 20 minutes.

06:21.897 --> 06:23.461
Ready, break.

06:25.808 --> 06:27.330
You guys want to go gamble?

06:27.346 --> 06:28.783
No, we got to go get the veil.

06:28.796 --> 06:31.033
Or we looked everywhere,
and we couldn't find one.

06:31.046 --> 06:32.412
Yeah, okay.

06:32.437 --> 06:35.443
No, you guys go ahead.
I'm going to find the veil.

06:37.517 --> 06:40.872
So this is it, right?
The last 20 minutes of your single life.

06:40.888 --> 06:41.992
- I'm proud of you, buddy.
- Thanks.

06:42.026 --> 06:43.690
- How are you feeling?
- Great, a little nervous.

06:43.725 --> 06:45.533
- Yeah? Craps?
- Not that nervous.

06:45.547 --> 06:48.020
- No, I mean do you want to play craps.
- Oh, yeah, definitely.

06:48.163 --> 06:49.661
Okay, I got the veil.

06:49.677 --> 06:51.123
She wasn't ready to be married.

06:51.139 --> 06:52.692
All right,
let's talk bachelor party.

06:52.709 --> 06:54.852
Are we thinking full-on strip club,
or should we rent a room

06:54.887 --> 06:57.632
and have a private
toy show-- whew.

06:57.648 --> 06:59.081
What did you just say?

06:59.097 --> 07:02.082
- Barney, no.
- Marshall, I'm your best man.

07:02.098 --> 07:03.770
- You're not my best man.
- Right here.

07:03.786 --> 07:06.660
And as your best man,
I have to throw you a bachelor party.

07:06.677 --> 07:08.261
That's part of
being a best friend.

07:08.275 --> 07:09.332
- You're not my best friend.
- Right here.

07:09.368 --> 07:11.641
Barney, I don't have any
time for a bachelor party.

07:11.668 --> 07:13.932
I've got, like, 18 minutes.

07:14.697 --> 07:16.601
18 minutes.

07:18.327 --> 07:20.581
Oh, good. Did you get the veil?

07:20.595 --> 07:21.712
Of course.

07:21.726 --> 07:24.850
And it took us
exactly 18 minutes.

07:24.867 --> 07:26.000
We went to a strip club.

07:26.018 --> 07:27.530
- Dude!
- Unbelievable!

07:27.547 --> 07:29.242
We weren't there for very long.
It's not like I had time

07:29.277 --> 07:32.300
to have a lap dance or anything.
I got a lap dance.

07:32.318 --> 07:34.772
- Your last lap dance ever.
- Right...

07:34.797 --> 07:35.751
What?

07:35.777 --> 07:38.850
Okay, I'm here. Right?

07:38.865 --> 07:42.923
Oh, God, the things people
waste money on in Atlantic City.

07:42.935 --> 07:44.661
Does it smell like
strippers in here?

07:44.678 --> 07:46.032
That's weird, right?

07:46.046 --> 07:48.270
Marshall and Lily
are getting married!

07:48.386 --> 07:50.391
Hell, yeah, look at this.

07:53.237 --> 07:55.941
Oh, baby, this is it.

07:55.966 --> 07:58.162
- Let's do this thing.
- All right.

07:58.368 --> 08:01.222
Hi. We're here to get married.

08:01.235 --> 08:04.420
Congratulations. We offer
a variety of packages

08:04.447 --> 08:07.931
to give you the special day
you've always dreamed about.

08:08.025 --> 08:11.003
We don't want any of that. Just your
basic quickie wedding will be fine.

08:11.025 --> 08:12.290
Yeah.

08:14.835 --> 08:17.392
You know this
isn't Vegas, right?

08:17.405 --> 08:20.222
Well, sure.
In Vegas, the casinos pump in oxygen.

08:20.238 --> 08:22.521
Here, it looks like
everyone brought their own.

08:23.458 --> 08:24.692
What?

08:25.406 --> 08:29.310
It also takes three days to get
a marriage license in New Jersey.

08:29.325 --> 08:31.371
The earliest I could
book you for is Monday.

08:31.385 --> 08:34.832
No, no, no, it has to be today.
That's the whole point.

08:34.857 --> 08:36.302
Look, I don't know what to say,

08:36.317 --> 08:38.921
but if you guys don't want
to book a wedding for Monday

08:38.937 --> 08:41.811
or play a round of keno,
I can't help you.

08:42.626 --> 08:44.651
Thirty-five.

08:51.498 --> 08:55.092
Wait, I don't understand, people get
married in Atlantic City all the time.

08:55.108 --> 08:57.283
Yes, they do,
but they don't elope.

08:57.296 --> 09:00.232
They choose Atlantic City
for its white sand beaches,

09:00.245 --> 09:03.601
world-class amenities,
and exotic Riviera feel.

09:03.617 --> 09:05.181
Have you been outside?

09:05.205 --> 09:08.742
There is half an orca whale rotting
not 20 feet from the cabana.

09:08.768 --> 09:10.232
You guys, take it easy, guys.

09:10.248 --> 09:11.622
Are you sure about this?

09:11.637 --> 09:15.493
About the marriage laws of the state
where I work in a wedding chapel?

09:15.508 --> 09:17.343
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

09:17.758 --> 09:20.861
Bright side:
the bachelor party continues!

09:20.888 --> 09:21.721
Yes!

09:21.736 --> 09:24.382
Continues? You mean
"start." He means "start."

09:24.397 --> 09:26.231
We went to a strip club.

09:26.535 --> 09:28.831
Twenty-seven.

09:30.496 --> 09:33.412
Is there any way that we
could get a license today?

09:33.427 --> 09:35.002
You could go to the courthouse.

09:35.018 --> 09:38.792
In  some extreme circumstances,
the waiting period can be waived,

09:38.805 --> 09:40.670
but you have to
have a good reason.

09:40.686 --> 09:42.040
Well, we're in love.

09:42.057 --> 09:43.942
What better reason
could there be?

09:43.958 --> 09:45.033
The last one I heard was,

09:45.045 --> 09:47.892
"I'm going to Iraq tomorrow
to defend my country,"

09:47.905 --> 09:50.963
but, you know,
give yours a whirl.

09:52.238 --> 09:54.710
So we went to the courthouse.

09:55.557 --> 09:58.053
God, this is taking forever.

09:58.615 --> 10:00.630
Can't believe they're
getting married.

10:00.648 --> 10:01.542
I know.

10:01.556 --> 10:04.450
I am so proud of these two.
After all they've been through.

10:04.466 --> 10:07.390
In fact,
that crazy road has led them

10:07.406 --> 10:09.843
all the way here
to Atlantic City.

10:09.866 --> 10:11.443
Ted, up here.

10:12.105 --> 10:14.833
You were just staring
at my shirt boobs.

10:14.845 --> 10:16.333
No! I wasn't.

10:16.345 --> 10:19.603
I-I was checking out the hot
bod underneath the shirt.

10:19.618 --> 10:22.881
Okay, look,
maybe I was looking at your shirt,

10:22.895 --> 10:26.982
but it's a, it's a funny,
funny shirt.

10:26.997 --> 10:29.122
Hey, it's Barney!

10:29.138 --> 10:31.000
- Barney!
- Hi.

10:34.528 --> 10:36.123
...suit up.

10:44.125 --> 10:45.902
...legend.

10:47.267 --> 10:48.851
...Daddy.

10:49.085 --> 10:50.541
American daddy.

10:56.225 --> 10:57.653
What the hell was that?

10:57.668 --> 11:00.211
A... Chinese guy?

11:01.448 --> 11:04.081
Hi. Hello.
Uh, we need a marriage license,

11:04.095 --> 11:07.072
but we need to skip the
waiting period because...

11:07.086 --> 11:08.222
we're in love.

11:08.237 --> 11:12.093
Aw. I'm gonna waive this
waiting period right now.

11:12.115 --> 11:13.163
Oh, really?!

11:13.178 --> 11:15.473
Is what I would say if I could
waive the waiting period,

11:15.488 --> 11:18.553
but unfortunately,
only a judge can do that.

11:18.568 --> 11:21.243
Oh. Well,
so can we see a judge?

11:21.255 --> 11:23.173
- Absolutely.
- Really?!

11:23.185 --> 11:26.203
Is what I would say if there was any
chance of you seeing a judge today,

11:26.216 --> 11:28.541
which there isn't.

11:28.557 --> 11:31.701
Why are you doing this to us?!

11:31.715 --> 11:34.133
'Cause you're on Candid Camera!

11:34.146 --> 11:36.020
- Really?!
- Is what I would say...

11:36.035 --> 11:37.843
You know what? We get it.

11:40.145 --> 11:43.263
Okay, this is a good plan B.

11:43.277 --> 11:45.450
Judges are people.
People go to the batoom.

11:45.468 --> 11:47.513
A judge is bound to
come by eventually,

11:47.525 --> 11:48.870
and we'll get married.

11:48.886 --> 11:51.111
I'm sure we won't
be waiting long.

11:57.436 --> 12:00.970
Geez, you go to a vending
machine for 30 seconds.

12:00.988 --> 12:02.293
Vultures.

12:09.528 --> 12:10.852
What?

12:12.458 --> 12:13.553
Here?

12:13.568 --> 12:15.993
Yeah. Got a little
time to kill.

12:16.938 --> 12:19.851
Oh, my God,
it's the T-shirt, isn't it?

12:19.867 --> 12:20.932
No.

12:21.246 --> 12:22.240
A little.

12:22.258 --> 12:24.802
Something is seriously
wrong with you.

12:24.825 --> 12:26.873
So what, is that a no?

12:27.918 --> 12:29.713
- All right, let's do it.
- All right.

12:29.728 --> 12:31.532
Um, also...?

12:31.546 --> 12:33.431
- Yes, I'll leave it on.
- Sweet.

12:33.666 --> 12:36.353
Guys, let's bail.
This is never gonna happen.

12:36.368 --> 12:39.430
Look, I know this is turning
into a bit of a disaster,

12:39.448 --> 12:42.653
but believe me,
it's better than the alternative.

12:42.668 --> 12:45.711
You throwing a big,
free party with lots of booze and food

12:45.728 --> 12:48.280
and  all your single,
desperate girlfriends from college?

12:48.298 --> 12:51.210
Yeah, glad we
dodged that bullet.

12:51.766 --> 12:54.671
Judge! Judge, come on.
Come on, come on, come on!

13:02.325 --> 13:03.992
- Turn it off.
- Okay.

13:05.576 --> 13:08.422
May we please get
married today?

13:08.436 --> 13:11.483
Now, normally I would say
no to a request like that,

13:11.508 --> 13:13.592
but you two impress me.

13:13.608 --> 13:16.733
Just the fact that you've
been together for ten years,

13:16.747 --> 13:20.310
standing by each other's
side through thick and thin,

13:20.327 --> 13:22.620
never wavering.

13:23.187 --> 13:26.050
- What was that?
- What was what?

13:26.066 --> 13:28.043
That little look.
What was that?

13:28.715 --> 13:30.791
A look of love.

13:31.258 --> 13:34.912
You two have stood together
through thick and thin, right?

13:34.928 --> 13:37.603
- You know, what's thick, what's thin?
- Yeah, I mean, all... yeah.

13:37.615 --> 13:38.791
I have.

13:39.276 --> 13:41.250
All right, what was that look?

13:42.235 --> 13:43.633
What's going on?

13:43.646 --> 13:45.403
They broke up over the summer.

13:45.415 --> 13:49.063
Lily totally ran off to San Francisco
and these two just had sex in the closet.

13:50.146 --> 13:52.323
What? We're under oath.

13:52.336 --> 13:53.710
No, we're not.

13:53.727 --> 13:57.362
Yeah, we are. He's a judge.

13:57.515 --> 13:58.983
Wh-- did we take an oath?

13:58.997 --> 14:00.940
Do you even know
what an oath is?

14:00.955 --> 14:04.031
Uh, yeah. Courthouse.

14:04.048 --> 14:06.222
Oath. We're under it.

14:10.595 --> 14:13.940
Guys. It's looking like
this isn't gonna happen.

14:13.958 --> 14:16.503
No, Marshall,
we are gonna get married today.

14:16.518 --> 14:19.670
Baby, anyplace we go,
we're gonna need a marriage license.

14:19.688 --> 14:22.303
Except international waters.

14:22.315 --> 14:24.673
So-so let's find
a ship captain.

14:24.686 --> 14:26.453
A ship captain can marry us.

14:26.468 --> 14:28.580
There's boats all
over this place.

14:28.595 --> 14:31.472
Oh, is that what those wooden things
are floating between the garbage?

14:31.487 --> 14:35.652
This is a great idea.
This is gonna work. Let's go.

14:36.718 --> 14:39.281
Excuse me.
Are you a ship captain?

14:39.296 --> 14:41.413
This is my machine.

14:43.478 --> 14:45.841
- I should go talk to her.
- No, let me.

14:48.635 --> 14:50.201
- Blackjack?
- Yeah.

14:52.455 --> 14:56.691
Well, I found a guy who said he'd be
willing to put his boat in my slip,

14:56.707 --> 14:58.541
so we're getting closer.

14:58.557 --> 15:02.621
Okay, Lil, why is it 
so important to do this today?

15:02.636 --> 15:05.772
Because... if we
don't do it today,

15:05.797 --> 15:08.510
I just know we're gonna wind
up having a huge wedding

15:08.526 --> 15:12.083
with a huge crowd full of
huge Midwestern people

15:12.097 --> 15:14.232
looking all disapproving
and judging me

15:14.247 --> 15:16.200
while sipping little
cups of mayonnaise

15:16.218 --> 15:19.143
and-and cracking runaway
bride jokes all night long.

15:19.157 --> 15:20.841
- Nobody's gonna do that.
- No, they're not

15:20.856 --> 15:22.542
because I'm not gonna
give them the chance.

15:22.577 --> 15:25.580
I'm gonna find a ship captain and
we're gonna be married tonight.

15:25.595 --> 15:27.272
Sweetie, this is crazy.

15:27.287 --> 15:28.583
You're never gonna
find a ship capt...

15:28.618 --> 15:30.812
Hey, Lily.
Found a ship captain.

15:30.825 --> 15:32.322
- What?
- Yeah.

15:32.337 --> 15:34.732
First guy we talked to.
Ship captain.

15:34.748 --> 15:36.202
How great is that?

15:36.215 --> 15:39.083
See? See, this is destiny.

15:39.097 --> 15:42.880
So, captain, can you take us out to
international waters and marry us?

15:42.897 --> 15:43.923
I sure can.

15:43.935 --> 15:47.613
If there's two things I love, it's
bringing people together in marriage

15:47.636 --> 15:49.860
- and making $5,000.
- What?

15:49.877 --> 15:53.232
Deal. $5,000, okay, we can do that.
Come on, everybody.

15:53.245 --> 15:56.140
Fork over your cash.
Don't think. Just do it.

15:56.158 --> 15:57.611
I can get us that money.

15:57.638 --> 15:58.733
How?

15:58.748 --> 16:00.442
Have you noticed
that all day today

16:00.466 --> 16:03.362
Chinese guys have been coming
up and saying hi to me?

16:03.376 --> 16:05.671
Yes. Have you noticed I
haven't asked about it

16:05.685 --> 16:07.680
because I'm too
scared of the answer?

16:07.798 --> 16:10.111
Well, those are my
old gambling buddies.

16:10.128 --> 16:12.703
Truth is...
I used to come here all the time.

16:12.727 --> 16:16.553
Play an old Chinese game
called "Shing Hasabu Shing".

16:16.566 --> 16:18.651
Had a small gambling problem.

16:18.805 --> 16:20.681
Actually, it wasn't
so small. I...

16:20.698 --> 16:23.830
kind of lost my entire
life's savings.

16:23.845 --> 16:26.480
But tonight, I don't know,
I'm feeling hot.

16:26.637 --> 16:28.883
I think I can win
us that money.

16:28.905 --> 16:31.832
No, we're not letting you
gamble all our money away.

16:31.856 --> 16:35.890
Uh, it's not gambling if you
absolutely know you're going to win.

16:36.015 --> 16:37.940
I'll get us that money.

16:38.455 --> 16:40.972
I swear it, nay...

16:40.985 --> 16:43.192
I oath it.

16:43.347 --> 16:46.671
Now, I had been to a lot of
casinos before that night,

16:46.686 --> 16:49.100
and I've been to a
lot of casinos since,

16:49.115 --> 16:52.810
but in all that time I've never
seen a game quite like this one.

16:52.827 --> 16:55.420
To this day,
I have no idea how it was played.

16:55.435 --> 16:57.500
But luckily, Barney did.

16:59.147 --> 17:00.441
Do you understand
what's happening?

17:00.475 --> 17:02.222
Not a clue.

17:22.165 --> 17:23.733
Do you think he's winning?

17:23.747 --> 17:25.750
I don't even know
if he's playing.

17:32.215 --> 17:34.222
Wait, I get it.
I understand this game.

17:34.235 --> 17:34.960
No, you don't.

17:34.978 --> 17:37.280
I totally understand
the game, Theodore.

17:37.296 --> 17:40.703
Barney, split your tiles. You can triple
your money if you find the jellybean.

17:40.716 --> 17:43.891
Marshall, please.
Don't you think I know what I'm...

17:44.835 --> 17:47.322
My God, you're right.

18:26.056 --> 18:29.102
Wow. It's beautiful.

18:29.266 --> 18:30.521
Thanks, Barney.

18:30.535 --> 18:32.171
Did you guys see me?
I was on fire tonight.

18:32.206 --> 18:33.612
Man, I can't wait to
get back to the shore.

18:33.648 --> 18:35.413
God, I love gambling!

18:35.436 --> 18:38.353
When we get home, we're gonna
go to a little meeting. Okay?

18:38.367 --> 18:40.462
Why can't I do it
just a little?

18:42.645 --> 18:43.880
Okay.

18:44.476 --> 18:46.720
Let's get this started.

18:48.186 --> 18:50.161
Okay, uh...

18:50.307 --> 18:52.893
you guys want the serious
one or the funny one?

18:52.907 --> 18:56.123
Oh, I think...
serious would be best.

18:56.148 --> 18:59.941
You sure? I got a lot of
great nautical jokes in there.

18:59.966 --> 19:03.151
Like how you two float each
other's boat, stuff like that.

19:03.167 --> 19:05.232
Yeah, serious is probably good.

19:09.326 --> 19:12.332
"We stand witness today

19:12.346 --> 19:16.980
"to celebrate the union
of Lily and Marshall.

19:17.048 --> 19:19.690
"Today, you two
will become one,

19:19.708 --> 19:21.750
"sharing your lives,

19:21.766 --> 19:24.003
"the happiness, the sadness,

19:24.015 --> 19:26.310
"the  frustrations
and the joy..."

19:26.378 --> 19:28.171
This is pretty cool.

19:28.186 --> 19:30.600
I can't believe you never
want to get married.

19:30.646 --> 19:32.793
I never said "never."

19:32.916 --> 19:34.801
"...to declare your love

19:34.818 --> 19:36.530
"and devotion to each other

19:36.555 --> 19:39.841
"in front of
friends and family,

19:39.855 --> 19:42.930
"all the people who
matter most to you."

19:43.076 --> 19:44.650
What was that?

19:44.866 --> 19:46.490
What was what?

19:47.368 --> 19:50.333
That little look.
You two just shared a look.

19:54.418 --> 19:57.133
- We don't want to do this.
- We don't.

19:57.147 --> 19:59.223
Are you kidding me?

19:59.238 --> 20:01.601
You guys are calling
off another wedding?

20:01.617 --> 20:05.241
After I spent all this
money on a bridesmaid shirt?

20:05.377 --> 20:08.441
Did I bet someone that they'd call it
off? I did, didn't I? Who'd I bet?

20:08.817 --> 20:11.713
You actually expect any of us are
gonna come to your third wedding?

20:11.727 --> 20:13.003
Yes.

20:13.015 --> 20:15.521
'Cause it's gonna be amazing.

20:15.546 --> 20:19.371
Look, before I was afraid
to face Marshall's family

20:19.385 --> 20:22.340
and-and I didn't want to
do all that work, but...

20:22.357 --> 20:24.300
now that we're here...

20:24.346 --> 20:27.501
I realize that I have to
face Marshall's family

20:27.527 --> 20:30.823
and I really want to
do all that work.

20:30.836 --> 20:32.202
So do I.

20:32.217 --> 20:36.120
And yeah... my family 
might still be upset with you.

20:36.136 --> 20:38.740
But when they see us up there, they're
gonna see how much we love each other

20:38.776 --> 20:41.550
and none of that other
stuff is gonna matter.

20:41.685 --> 20:44.590
- I love you, Marshall.
- I love you, too, Lily pad.

20:44.757 --> 20:46.662
I now pronounce
you man and wife.

20:46.687 --> 20:47.940
- What?!
- What?!

20:48.226 --> 20:49.623
What, is that not right?

20:49.635 --> 20:52.151
Are... we married?
Did you just marry us?

20:52.165 --> 20:54.231
Weren't you listening?
We don't want to be married.

20:54.248 --> 20:57.952
Uh... I-I suppose I
could unpronounce you.

20:57.968 --> 21:00.761
- Unpronounce us.
- Unpronounce us!

21:00.788 --> 21:03.150
All right,
I unpronounce you man and wife.

21:03.168 --> 21:05.522
Oh, whew... that was close.

21:05.585 --> 21:08.472
And that's the story of how
Uncle Marshall and Aunt Lily

21:08.496 --> 21:10.603
got married for 12 seconds

21:10.616 --> 21:12.952
somewhere off the
coast of Atlantic City.

21:17.597 --> 21:19.231
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

21:20.027 --> 21:21.382
Ted.

21:30.006 --> 21:31.521
Is Robin here?

21:31.538 --> 21:33.243
Man, I hope so.
