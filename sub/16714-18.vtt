My favorite number.

11:54.326 --> 11:55.658
Next number's 14.

11:55.660 --> 11:58.261
So 14. OK, we can do this.

12:19.751 --> 12:23.419
[Grunting]

12:46.044 --> 12:49.012
You haven't asked me how I'm doing.

12:50.282 --> 12:52.649
Every time I talk to these agents,

12:52.651 --> 12:54.551
it's the first thing they want to know.

12:54.553 --> 12:56.920
I guess it's just the
natural thing to ask.

12:56.922 --> 12:58.655
But you didn't.

12:58.657 --> 13:00.990
No, I didn't.

13:00.992 --> 13:05.094
Because you've seen so many of
these cases, you know how I'm doing?

13:05.096 --> 13:07.830
Because it's not fair
that I ask that question.

13:10.865 --> 13:13.066
I don't have any words.

13:15.941 --> 13:17.636
And today...

13:17.839 --> 13:19.441
I know.

13:19.503 --> 13:23.179
She's 16.

13:23.181 --> 13:27.654
16 years ago, Katie was the
sweetest thing I ever saw.

13:28.553 --> 13:31.107
I couldn't believe we made her.

13:32.157 --> 13:36.059
I guess everybody feels that
at that moment, you know?

13:37.776 --> 13:39.557
Now I don't know.

13:40.446 --> 13:41.745
I should have done something.

13:41.747 --> 13:44.781
I should have helped find her by now.

13:47.352 --> 13:49.686
I don't pretend to know
what you're going through,

13:49.688 --> 13:51.721
uh...

13:51.723 --> 13:55.459
But my oldest daughter just turned 16.

13:55.461 --> 13:58.862
And all I can do is hope and pray

13:58.864 --> 14:01.765
that I've given her the
right tools to survive.

14:04.236 --> 14:05.836
Yeah, I know.

14:08.540 --> 14:13.376
But it's her birthday, and she's gone.

14:29.061 --> 14:33.199
I brought you something
to keep your energy up.

14:33.377 --> 14:35.177
A little vitamin c.

14:48.914 --> 14:49.980
[Moans]

14:49.982 --> 14:52.115
Sorry.

14:59.340 --> 15:02.168
So you haven't asked today's question.

15:02.995 --> 15:06.309
Just one yes/no question

15:07.399 --> 15:10.166
and I have the right to remain silent.

15:11.637 --> 15:13.069
OK?

15:15.659 --> 15:17.158
OK.

15:19.177 --> 15:22.279
So when you leave here...

15:22.281 --> 15:25.021
Hey! Think, think, think.

15:25.784 --> 15:27.529
Right.

15:28.220 --> 15:31.721
But do you leave because you have a job?

15:33.487 --> 15:35.167
Yes.

15:36.081 --> 15:38.666
The same one since I was 18.

15:39.765 --> 15:42.479
Doesn't happen much anymore, does it?

15:43.468 --> 15:46.336
This one time a few years ago,

15:46.338 --> 15:49.172
across from my work, it was late.

15:49.174 --> 15:52.384
This coroner's van
was loading in a body.

15:52.811 --> 15:54.611
No sirens, nothing.

15:54.613 --> 15:57.447
Figured it wasn't a
murder, so I walk over,

15:57.449 --> 15:59.583
ask what happened.

15:59.585 --> 16:02.852
Coroner starts puking.

16:02.854 --> 16:06.389
I mean, you'd think he'd
seen everything, right?

16:06.391 --> 16:10.026
Turns out this lady had
been dead a couple weeks.

16:10.028 --> 16:12.294
Nobody knew it.

16:13.465 --> 16:16.466
A hundred people in her building,

16:16.468 --> 16:19.569
a thousand on the block...

16:21.974 --> 16:24.628
Millions on this island.

16:26.044 --> 16:28.442
Nobody missed her.

16:30.015 --> 16:32.505
Nobody even noticed.

16:33.452 --> 16:35.585
How did they find her?

16:35.587 --> 16:37.621
The smell.

16:37.623 --> 16:39.990
Happens all the time, he said.

16:39.992 --> 16:42.336
He went up there and
the stink just pshhh!

16:43.662 --> 16:45.795
Punched him in the face.

16:48.033 --> 16:50.367
He needed some air, so he
went over to open the window

16:50.369 --> 16:52.380
and it was all blacked out.

16:53.138 --> 16:56.706
But then it starts moving.

16:56.708 --> 17:00.243
Like wiggling.

17:01.480 --> 17:05.348
The glass was covered in flies.

17:05.349 --> 17:08.790
Bzzzzzzz.

17:09.954 --> 17:12.188
I mean, they were pretty
much the dead lady,

17:12.190 --> 17:15.458
since her body was all maggots, right?

17:18.063 --> 17:22.799
One dead lady made 100,000 flies.

17:28.507 --> 17:30.903
Crazy, right?

17:38.150 --> 17:41.685
Hey, the guy who came to
see you, was that Rossi,

17:41.687 --> 17:43.219
the one you play chess with?

17:43.221 --> 17:44.014
Yeah.

17:44.045 --> 17:45.922
He showed you how to
castle strategically?

17:45.924 --> 17:47.490
No, that was my friend Gideon.

17:47.492 --> 17:49.449
He was killed a couple years ago.

17:49.861 --> 17:53.963
Damn. Hope that's not an omen for me.

17:57.436 --> 17:59.703
Hey, I'm kidding.

17:59.705 --> 18:03.777
Gotta move on, man. Delgado
got himself into that mess.

18:03.824 --> 18:06.810
Did you know they'd kill him?

18:06.812 --> 18:11.874
Look... I figured they'd send a message.

18:13.118 --> 18:16.380
I got to admit I didn't
think it's be that loud.

18:19.991 --> 18:23.763
I got a house full of people
right now and all I want is quiet.

18:27.766 --> 18:30.166
It reminds me of when my dad died.

18:30.168 --> 18:32.863
I keep having this flash of my mom.

18:33.472 --> 18:36.706
She's sitting with her
friends and they're mourning.

18:36.708 --> 18:40.777
You know? And I realized
that they're all widows.

18:42.647 --> 18:43.986
Widows.

18:44.816 --> 18:47.784
It got me thinking.

18:49.454 --> 18:53.283
There's no word for a
mom who loses a child.

18:54.025 --> 18:57.439
Or for a little girl
who loses her world.

19:01.133 --> 19:03.600
Attie asked me the other day
if she'd still be a sister

19:03.602 --> 19:05.769
if we don't find Katie.

19:05.771 --> 19:08.204
Attie will always be a sister.

19:08.206 --> 19:10.273
OK? She has to believe that.

19:10.275 --> 19:11.307
OK?

19:13.378 --> 19:14.580
[Sighs]

19:14.729 --> 19:16.279
Listen to me. We are gonna do

19:16.281 --> 19:18.648
everything we can to find Katie,

19:18.650 --> 19:21.126
I promise you.

19:22.220 --> 19:24.654
But I'm gonna need your help.

19:24.656 --> 19:26.623
Please.

19:26.625 --> 19:28.391
OK.

19:29.203 --> 19:30.687
JJ: What's all this?

19:30.742 --> 19:32.428
We found similar victimologies and M.O.S

19:32.430 --> 19:33.763
all over the city.

19:33.765 --> 19:34.832
Why weren't they connected?

19:34.856 --> 19:36.933
NYPD wrote off evidence of venipuncture

19:36.935 --> 19:38.434
because these women were all addicts.

19:38.436 --> 19:40.804
We've got over two dozen
in the past 10 years.

19:40.806 --> 19:43.306
Some of them were never
found, so we can't be sure,

19:43.308 --> 19:47.527
but the ones that were, the
average captivity time was 6 days.

20:17.809 --> 20:20.844
Help! Please!

20:20.846 --> 20:23.379
Somebody, I'm stuck down here!

20:23.381 --> 20:25.949
Please, someone!

20:25.951 --> 20:28.251
Help! Please!

20:28.253 --> 20:29.719
Please, I'm stuck down here!

20:29.721 --> 20:31.354
Can anyone hear me?!

20:31.356 --> 20:33.957
Someone! Please help me!

21:10.092 --> 21:11.859
Hey. Hey!

21:11.861 --> 21:13.861
Tell your boss to get
some more lights out here.

21:13.863 --> 21:14.795
It's creepy.

21:14.797 --> 21:16.663
Mm-hmm. I'll tell him.

21:29.278 --> 21:30.932
I waited all day, but I don't know

21:30.955 --> 21:32.646
when I can go back in
and talk to him again.

21:32.648 --> 21:33.647
How is he?

21:33.649 --> 21:35.282
Exhausted.

21:35.284 --> 21:38.742
He's in group therapy
for his friend's murder,

21:38.835 --> 21:41.655
but I don't... I don't know
if it's making any difference.

21:41.657 --> 21:43.624
Talking it out is beneficial.

21:43.626 --> 21:46.059
When you're with friends, sure.

21:46.061 --> 21:47.428
But he doesn't have any in there.

21:47.430 --> 21:48.595
Not anymore.

21:48.597 --> 21:49.792
I'm glad you went to see him.

21:49.838 --> 21:51.298
Yeah, me, too.

21:54.103 --> 21:57.495
Reid. Show him what to do.

21:58.441 --> 22:00.214
Hey, I'm Spencer.

22:00.260 --> 22:03.944
I'm Malcolm. Shaw told me you were cool.

22:03.946 --> 22:05.879
How do you know Shaw?

22:05.881 --> 22:07.915
I worked with him on the outside.

22:07.917 --> 22:10.350
Long time ago.

22:10.352 --> 22:13.490
I help the good guys every now and then.

22:13.956 --> 22:16.052
Now I'm in here, so is he.

22:16.892 --> 22:19.560
Small world. Know what I mean?

22:19.562 --> 22:21.059
Yeah.

22:21.897 --> 22:23.297
Incoming.

22:35.177 --> 22:37.945
Frazier told me we were the
guards for his private stash.

22:37.947 --> 22:39.436
I heard.

22:39.514 --> 22:42.006
He trust me 'cause he know
I won't touch the stuff.

22:42.518 --> 22:43.817
Why'd he pick you?

22:43.819 --> 22:46.286
Does it matter?

22:46.288 --> 22:47.917
Nah.

22:48.457 --> 22:51.925
I heard the guards are
doubling up after the lockdown.

22:51.927 --> 22:53.460
We'll take it out on the late shift.

22:53.462 --> 22:54.928
Cool?

23:04.673 --> 23:08.542
[Footsteps approaching]

23:08.966 --> 23:11.245
Thought you might be hungry.

23:11.247 --> 23:13.037
Got us green curry.

23:13.616 --> 23:16.583
What did you do?

23:16.585 --> 23:18.852
You tried again, didn't you?

23:18.854 --> 23:20.420
I told you it's dangerous.

23:20.422 --> 23:22.523
If you fall, you'll
crack your head open, OK?

23:22.525 --> 23:24.358
So just don't do that anymore.

23:24.360 --> 23:28.362
Please. Please just get out of here.

23:28.364 --> 23:30.933
I need to see my family.

23:31.634 --> 23:35.806
I won't tell anyone
about you or this place.

23:36.338 --> 23:38.171
Please! Please!

23:38.173 --> 23:39.533
- I can't!
- Please!

23:40.409 --> 23:41.626
I can't.

23:42.811 --> 23:45.078
And I hate it when you cry.

23:45.080 --> 23:46.446
Please stop.

23:46.448 --> 23:48.782
There's almost a kindness to this guy.

23:48.784 --> 23:52.052
I know that sounds weird,
but he shows a lot of remorse.

23:52.054 --> 23:55.789
Leaving them in the
light looking like angels.

23:55.791 --> 23:58.258
Maybe he's thanking
them for their sacrifice.

23:58.260 --> 23:59.826
Could be. Or maybe these women

23:59.828 --> 24:02.195
represent some Madonna figure,

24:02.197 --> 24:05.399
or the blood is a twisted communion.

24:05.401 --> 24:06.533
Let's go back to what we know.

24:06.535 --> 24:08.335
Victims have been
left all over the city,

24:08.337 --> 24:10.871
which means he definitely
feels at home there.

24:10.873 --> 24:13.307
He's gotta have a big enough
vehicle to transport them.

24:13.309 --> 24:15.142
I've got Clayton's
team going back 10 years

24:15.144 --> 24:17.277
looking for footage on the
nights the vics went missing,

24:17.279 --> 24:19.212
also when they were found.
Maybe the same vehicle

24:19.214 --> 24:21.081
shows up at more than one location.

24:21.083 --> 24:24.184
Look how many victims went
missing from hell's kitchen.

24:24.186 --> 24:25.605
This could be his comfort zone.

24:25.611 --> 24:27.721
What if Katie went there
after she got out of the cab.

24:27.723 --> 24:29.056
You mean she lied to her parents?

24:29.058 --> 24:31.391
She's 16, and that's what you do.

24:31.393 --> 24:33.493
Well, let's look at the
cameras in that area,

24:33.495 --> 24:35.444
see if she went there that night.

24:35.898 --> 24:37.130
Could you hear it?

24:37.132 --> 24:41.668
The drumming when you
climbed the ladder?

24:41.670 --> 24:43.403
A little.

24:43.405 --> 24:44.805
[Drumming]

24:44.807 --> 24:46.416
That guy's good.

24:47.042 --> 24:48.942
I wish I could do that.

24:52.481 --> 24:54.399
You haven't eaten much.

24:54.883 --> 24:56.583
I'm not that hungry.

24:56.585 --> 24:58.051
You sure?

25:10.065 --> 25:14.067
[Distant siren]

25:14.069 --> 25:15.202
You know, if you listen,

25:15.204 --> 25:19.589
I mean... Really listen...

25:20.409 --> 25:22.109
You can hear all of it.

25:22.111 --> 25:24.044
[Drumming continues]

25:24.046 --> 25:26.780
Not just the music, but the...

25:26.782 --> 25:29.716
The horses going back into their stables

25:29.718 --> 25:35.160
and the... The buzzing
of the cell phone towers.

25:36.058 --> 25:38.392
Everyone and everything.

25:38.394 --> 25:39.793
But they can't hear you.

25:39.795 --> 25:41.928
It's like a magic trick.

25:41.930 --> 25:43.697
Go on.

25:43.699 --> 25:45.532
Give it a try.

25:46.702 --> 25:48.702
Help!

25:48.704 --> 25:50.904
I'm here!

25:50.906 --> 25:52.806
Anybody?!

25:54.877 --> 25:57.010
See? Told you.

26:00.883 --> 26:04.217
When I'm here alone, I can
hear the souls of the city.

26:04.219 --> 26:08.221
You know, the ones that
were here before any of us.

26:08.223 --> 26:10.891
They've got a story to tell.

26:10.893 --> 26:14.428
When you were little, were
you afraid of the dark?

26:14.430 --> 26:16.196
I guess.

26:16.198 --> 26:18.598
It's because they tell us that
bad things will happen there.

26:18.600 --> 26:20.734
You know, things that will hurt us.

26:20.736 --> 26:23.904
Monsters in closets, right?

26:23.906 --> 26:25.038
Right.

26:25.040 --> 26:26.540
So then you turn on the light

26:26.542 --> 26:29.376
and you see there's nothing there.

26:29.378 --> 26:33.280
Nothing can hurt you when there's light.

26:33.282 --> 26:34.815
Not me.

26:36.021 --> 26:38.365
This is the thing that's
always brought me pain.

26:38.396 --> 26:40.153
But that's OK.

26:40.155 --> 26:41.621
I've always heard it's the darkness

26:41.623 --> 26:43.970
that teaches us who we really are.

26:44.793 --> 26:47.994
[Honking, siren]

26:49.765 --> 26:51.598
Are there any leads?

26:51.600 --> 26:54.568
We think whoever has Katie
may have done this before.

26:54.570 --> 26:56.269
What happened to those girls?

26:56.271 --> 26:58.071
Well, I can't go into details,

26:58.073 --> 26:59.506
but I can tell you the good thing is

26:59.508 --> 27:01.808
it means we have behaviors to track

27:01.810 --> 27:03.436
and patterns he's established.

27:03.444 --> 27:06.046
OK, are you any closer today
than you were yesterday?

27:06.048 --> 27:08.448
Yes. We think he operates
out of hell's kitchen.

27:08.450 --> 27:11.789
Now, is there any reason that Katie
would have ended up in that area?

27:12.454 --> 27:14.554
Was she going to see you?

27:14.556 --> 27:17.134
Oh, my god.

27:20.229 --> 27:22.329
You live there?

27:22.331 --> 27:23.880
- Yeah.
- And she's done this before.

27:23.919 --> 27:26.184
She's come to visit by herself?

27:26.702 --> 27:27.534
She's 15.

27:27.536 --> 27:29.069
16.

27:29.071 --> 27:31.655
16. She knows the subways.

27:31.678 --> 27:33.740
It's not unusual, is my point.

27:33.742 --> 27:36.276
Did she tell you she was
going to stop by your place

27:36.278 --> 27:39.125
- the night she went missing?
- No. God, no.

27:39.181 --> 27:41.748
You think I would keep
that from you guys?

27:41.750 --> 27:42.949
Of course I didn't know.

27:42.951 --> 27:45.252
We had a deal. The
courts made a decision.

27:45.254 --> 27:48.021
You get every other
weekend and that's it.

27:48.023 --> 27:49.726
How many times has she done this?

27:49.765 --> 27:51.558
A few. I don't know.
I didn't count, Liz.

27:51.560 --> 27:53.093
How many times, Bob?

27:54.496 --> 27:56.062
Two. Two times a week.

27:56.064 --> 27:57.130
What?

27:57.132 --> 27:58.431
We were gonna tell you.

27:58.433 --> 27:59.666
OK? I knew you'd be mad.

27:59.668 --> 28:01.635
She knew you'd be mad,
too, and look at you.

28:01.637 --> 28:02.936
You are.

28:02.938 --> 28:05.290
She just wanted some peace.

28:05.808 --> 28:07.073
She told me that you would grill her

28:07.075 --> 28:09.209
every time I had the
girls for the weekend.

28:09.211 --> 28:11.444
She just wanted to
spend some time with me

28:11.446 --> 28:13.814
without having to worry
about what you'd think.

28:13.816 --> 28:17.751
3 trains. My house to yours. 3.

28:17.753 --> 28:19.219
Do you know how many
people could have seen her

28:19.221 --> 28:20.987
two or three times a week?

28:20.989 --> 28:23.590
How many people could have seen
her all alone in the subway?

28:23.592 --> 28:25.425
Walking into your building?

28:25.427 --> 28:29.496
You made her a target. I mean,
my god, what is wrong with you?!

28:31.834 --> 28:34.534
Do you know why your
parents got divorced?

28:34.536 --> 28:35.535
No.

28:35.537 --> 28:37.003
Come on, you must.

28:37.005 --> 28:39.472
You've lived with them.

28:39.474 --> 28:41.308
They just fought a lot.

28:41.310 --> 28:43.844
I think they just stopped being happy.

28:45.814 --> 28:47.581
Why are you like this?

28:47.583 --> 28:48.515
Like this?

28:48.517 --> 28:50.116
Like what?

28:51.153 --> 28:53.086
Like a freak?

28:54.423 --> 28:56.389
What I have is so rare,

28:56.391 --> 28:58.325
it takes two people with
a genetic screw loose

28:58.327 --> 29:00.560
to find one another.

29:03.532 --> 29:08.034
What god would want to make
such a colossal mistake?

29:08.036 --> 29:09.769
You're not a mistake.

29:09.771 --> 29:10.937
My mom thought I was.

29:10.939 --> 29:12.405
And your dad?

29:13.408 --> 29:17.878
He wasn't... Happy...

29:17.880 --> 29:19.145
As you'd say.

29:19.147 --> 29:21.514
So who raised you?

29:21.516 --> 29:23.392
My uncle.

29:23.986 --> 29:26.453
He got back from Vietnam and
everybody said he'd changed,

29:26.455 --> 29:28.521
but he was always good to me.

29:28.523 --> 29:30.157
We needed each other.

29:30.181 --> 29:34.461
If it weren't for him, I don't
know what would have happened.

29:34.463 --> 29:36.096
So you believe in fate.

29:36.098 --> 29:37.998
Yeah.

29:39.301 --> 29:41.835
You believe in it, right?

29:42.838 --> 29:46.373
No. Not anymore.

29:50.312 --> 29:51.778
But think about it.

29:51.780 --> 29:54.514
If... if you hadn't've lost your phone,

29:54.516 --> 29:57.317
then maybe you would have gone out
with your friends like you planned.

29:57.319 --> 30:00.120
Instead, you went to
your dad's and I saw you.

30:00.122 --> 30:02.508
Fate brought us together.

30:10.283 --> 30:11.716
You don't buy it.

30:17.105 --> 30:20.073
Let me try and find a way out of here,

30:20.075 --> 30:22.909
and if I can't...

30:22.911 --> 30:26.041
Then I'll believe in fate again.

30:35.524 --> 30:37.190
Run.

30:41.263 --> 30:44.097
[Panting]

30:59.225 --> 31:03.679
[Indistinct chatter]

31:06.751 --> 31:08.885
A second discovered attack.

31:08.887 --> 31:12.355
You might be unpredictable, after all.

31:13.424 --> 31:14.791
How do you know Malcolm?

31:14.793 --> 31:16.526
Who?

31:16.528 --> 31:18.561
Malcolm. He says he knows you.

31:21.533 --> 31:23.499
Mm. Don't know any Malcolm.

31:23.501 --> 31:27.603
Names and faces. The only two
things I'm actually good at.

31:27.605 --> 31:29.872
And chess.

31:29.874 --> 31:32.909
I'm telling you, I never met the guy.

31:34.412 --> 31:36.145
Hmm.

31:36.147 --> 31:38.414
I'm not going to move the drugs.

31:44.689 --> 31:47.156
They're gonna beat you again.

31:47.158 --> 31:48.758
Might even kill you.

31:48.760 --> 31:50.226
I'll survive.

31:50.228 --> 31:52.495
Besides, they don't really need me now

31:52.497 --> 31:54.564
that you put Malcolm in there.

31:54.566 --> 31:56.766
What? I...

31:56.768 --> 31:59.535
I put him in there?
I don't even know him.

31:59.537 --> 32:01.037
I think you do.

32:01.039 --> 32:04.507
Calvin... I think you're the one
that pulls the strings in here.

32:04.509 --> 32:08.044
You decide when to help, and
you decide when to look away,

32:08.046 --> 32:09.545
and you have a lot of friends,

32:09.547 --> 32:10.613
and they're afraid of you,

32:10.615 --> 32:12.782
so they play your little game.

32:12.784 --> 32:15.051
Like you said, they don't fight it.

32:15.053 --> 32:17.119
You're losing it.

32:17.121 --> 32:19.522
You got too much time on your hands

32:19.524 --> 32:21.614
to think of all this.

32:22.327 --> 32:24.341
What are you looking at?

32:25.230 --> 32:27.230
I'm looking at a fisherman

32:27.232 --> 32:29.198
who cannot swim.

32:29.200 --> 32:30.867
Yeah?

32:32.237 --> 32:33.836
Hmm.

32:39.477 --> 32:41.577
Check.

32:41.579 --> 32:44.413
[Panting]

32:47.652 --> 32:49.051
Guys, we are running out of time.

32:49.053 --> 32:50.853
Katie's gonna stay on this board

32:50.855 --> 32:52.722
if we don't hurry up.
So what have we got?

32:52.724 --> 32:53.856
Well, there's a pattern.

32:53.858 --> 32:56.025
Not all of the women
were missing 3 liters.

32:56.027 --> 32:57.660
Some were only one.

32:57.662 --> 32:59.673
The healthier the victim, the
more blood they were missing.

32:59.728 --> 33:02.298
It's like he's conducting experiments.

33:02.300 --> 33:04.567
Alvez: Maybe he's got
some kind of disorder

33:04.569 --> 33:06.636
and thinks using the
healthiest blood will cure it.

33:06.638 --> 33:08.938
Only it doesn't, so he keeps
looking for the right one.

33:08.940 --> 33:10.106
Hey, Garcia.

33:10.108 --> 33:12.141
Speakerphone. Captain, my captain.

33:12.143 --> 33:13.609
Can you look for blood diseases

33:13.611 --> 33:16.445
that would benefit from a
transfusion every 5 months?

33:16.447 --> 33:18.481
Mm. I don't want to assume
'cause you know what that means.

33:18.483 --> 33:20.449
But can I presume we're
talking about fatal ones?

33:20.451 --> 33:21.617
Not necessarily.

33:21.619 --> 33:23.319
All right. Just trying to nail it down,

33:23.321 --> 33:26.155
because there are a surprising
number of blood diseases out there.

33:26.157 --> 33:28.157
Look for patients who
live in hell's kitchen.

33:28.159 --> 33:30.226
He only abducts and dumps at night.

33:30.228 --> 33:31.994
Maybe he works graveyard shifts.

33:31.996 --> 33:35.831
But what if that isn't by
choice, but by necessity?

33:35.833 --> 33:38.334
[Sound of running]

33:38.336 --> 33:42.161
Looked at the street cams of
all the abduction and dump sites.

33:43.541 --> 33:46.809
We got utility trucks and city cars,

33:46.811 --> 33:48.344
but this one came up the most.

33:48.346 --> 33:49.912
It looks like a trade van.

33:49.914 --> 33:51.681
Stolen tags, which
means it's a huge risk

33:51.683 --> 33:53.382
every time he drives it.

33:53.384 --> 33:54.884
He can't even park it on the street.

33:54.886 --> 33:56.552
He must have a private lot or garage.

33:56.554 --> 33:59.088
Look at that. All of the
windows are blacked out.

33:59.090 --> 34:00.690
Even the windshield is tinted.

34:00.692 --> 34:04.035
It's like he's paranoid about lights.

34:04.862 --> 34:07.630
All of the women had zinc on them.

34:07.632 --> 34:08.898
Like from sunscreen?

34:08.900 --> 34:12.868
Well, there is a rare genetic disorder

34:12.870 --> 34:15.371
called Xeroderma Pigmentosum, or XP.

34:15.373 --> 34:18.174
It is a blood disease where people burn

34:18.176 --> 34:19.641
when they're exposed to light.

34:19.643 --> 34:21.944
And he's showing all the
signs of avoiding light.

34:21.946 --> 34:23.212
Whoa. It's rare, all right.

34:23.214 --> 34:25.652
I show no one in New York
city with that condition.

34:25.909 --> 34:27.850
Well, it was a long shot.

34:27.851 --> 34:29.251
No, no, wait, I think
you're onto something.

34:29.253 --> 34:32.681
Where can he find isolation
and total darkness?

34:33.591 --> 34:35.123
Underground.

Voice-over: I'm starting
to think like them.

34:54.145 --> 34:56.245
I'm starting to survive like them.

34:56.246 --> 34:58.247
I'm here because I made a choice.

34:58.249 --> 35:01.717
And what if that means
I don't get out alive?

35:14.669 --> 35:17.090
There's a helplessness
in here that causes people

35:17.176 --> 35:19.805
to do things they would
never have considered.

35:22.106 --> 35:24.125
No one in here is honest.

OK, guys, here's something
isolated where she was walking.

'cause the taxes are still being paid,

36:04.749 --> 36:06.682
but there's no record
of who that someone is.
