WEBVTT

00:00.008 --> 00:01.486
What did she do to him?

00:01.511 --> 00:04.271
She nailed him to a tree and slit
his throat.

00:04.819 --> 00:08.031
We need to talk about you torturing
my staff.

00:10.047 --> 00:13.687
I killed him eight years ago. I
shouldn't have to do it again.

00:13.712 --> 00:15.600
Think about what he took from me.

00:15.741 --> 00:18.741
He acted alone
and killed without hesitation.

00:18.929 --> 00:20.229
Steve?

00:20.599 --> 00:23.375
I think that means you've been
murdering innocent people.

00:28.392 --> 00:29.392
No!

00:33.480 --> 00:35.781
I've seen what she's capable of...

00:35.984 --> 00:37.795
but I can't prove it.

00:38.875 --> 00:41.035
So what am I supposed to do with her?

00:41.060 --> 00:42.428
End the game.

00:54.583 --> 00:55.583
Thanks mate.

01:03.824 --> 01:06.585
Oyi! Oyi!

01:07.023 --> 01:08.742
Police! Police!

01:08.939 --> 01:10.015
I am fine!

01:57.319 --> 01:58.319
Hello Stranger.

01:58.487 --> 01:59.487
What do you want?

01:59.559 --> 02:01.398
Just want to talk.

02:01.423 --> 02:02.594
I thought you'd said
everything you needed to

02:02.618 --> 02:04.054
when you put a gun to my head.

02:04.079 --> 02:05.421
Come on.

02:06.570 --> 02:08.609
You've never done bad things?

02:08.970 --> 02:09.970
Not like that.

02:10.320 --> 02:13.611
No, you gamble
on your daughter's life.

02:14.289 --> 02:15.928
Risked her drowning.

02:16.407 --> 02:17.872
What a nice man you are.

02:17.887 --> 02:19.508
That's done, it's in the past.

02:19.523 --> 02:22.388
And what I've done, to the man who
murdered my children,

02:22.403 --> 02:23.988
that is done too.

02:24.003 --> 02:25.642
So you're a sweet girl now, hey?

02:25.667 --> 02:28.544
Just the odd murder here and there,
when you fancy it?

02:30.366 --> 02:32.276
How can you be so small?

02:33.914 --> 02:36.000
You have something
that makes you different

02:36.025 --> 02:37.811
from everyone else on the planet.

02:38.618 --> 02:40.181
Everyone except me.

02:42.075 --> 02:44.114
There was a moment

02:45.234 --> 02:47.250
when I thought
you were everything.

02:48.523 --> 02:50.750
When I thought we could be perfect.

02:51.991 --> 02:53.268
We can be.

02:53.593 --> 02:57.148
Then I saw you kill a man
without hesitation.

03:03.828 --> 03:06.485
Exit the passionate lover.

03:07.070 --> 03:09.031
Enter the boring policeman.

03:11.787 --> 03:15.222
So, what are you going you do with me?

03:17.123 --> 03:18.585
What can I do?

03:19.437 --> 03:20.874
It's over.

03:25.163 --> 03:26.351
Is it?

03:29.288 --> 03:31.772
The guilty will be punished Harry.

03:44.403 --> 03:45.887
What do you mean?

03:46.773 --> 03:48.988
Isabella, what are
you going to do?

03:59.211 --> 04:01.805

04:37.109 --> 04:39.140
Morning all. So...

04:39.203 --> 04:41.414
what brings me to Soho?

04:41.718 --> 04:44.061
One dead body. Belonging to...

04:44.086 --> 04:46.593
Dean Adams. Forty-seven,
property developer.

04:46.664 --> 04:47.631
Is this place his?

04:47.656 --> 04:49.962
No. It belongs to a Sam Browning.

04:50.068 --> 04:51.948
We're having a little trouble
tracking him down.

04:52.018 --> 04:54.200
There's a hair underneath the
fingernail.

04:54.810 --> 04:57.390
He didn't put up much of a struggle,
but it's something.

04:57.415 --> 04:58.321
A hair?

04:58.336 --> 05:00.560
Long, black. A woman's, I'd say.

05:00.575 --> 05:02.280
Not much of a romantic spot is it.

05:02.295 --> 05:03.041
Drug deal?

05:03.056 --> 05:05.240
Easier places to score
than here.

05:05.256 --> 05:08.281
He doesn't look like a user, but the
tox report will tell us something.

05:08.530 --> 05:10.960
So he comes up here,
alone with a woman...

05:11.148 --> 05:14.889
She just lures him up here for sex,
but it's a trap, it gets messy...

05:15.492 --> 05:17.573
No, there'd be more of a struggle.

05:17.815 --> 05:19.125
And he wasn't robbed.

05:19.535 --> 05:21.836
So what else you got Mister?

05:38.295 --> 05:39.815
The Green Dragon Casino.

05:40.849 --> 05:42.288
Well. Well. Well.

05:52.055 --> 05:53.866
Lily-Anne Lau.

05:54.536 --> 05:55.857
Long time.

05:56.375 --> 05:57.960
Harry Clayton.

05:58.451 --> 05:59.932
Business or pleasure?

06:04.815 --> 06:06.135
Business it is then.

06:08.695 --> 06:10.280
Did you know Dean Adams?

06:10.760 --> 06:13.412
No. Who is he?

06:14.055 --> 06:17.061
He turned up dead in Soho, with one
of your chips in his pocket.

06:19.022 --> 06:20.559
He never visited your casino?

06:20.574 --> 06:22.767
If he did, I wasn't aware.

06:23.553 --> 06:25.186
We have so many clients.

06:25.378 --> 06:26.576
Don't we, Harry?

06:27.054 --> 06:30.498
So none of your employees would say
you talked to him,

06:30.713 --> 06:33.715
maybe gave him the VIP treatment?

06:33.890 --> 06:35.180
Ask them.

06:37.780 --> 06:40.160
Is it just gonna be the two of you
questioning me?

06:40.333 --> 06:41.430
It's just...

06:41.686 --> 06:44.247
I have other friends who
I'd love to catch up with.

06:47.060 --> 06:48.083
Sir.

06:48.180 --> 06:49.220
What?

06:50.220 --> 06:53.350
Isn't this nice?
Just like old times.

06:54.322 --> 06:56.160
Still dragging her down with you?

06:58.660 --> 07:01.085
But if we were to find people who
said that you did know.

07:01.607 --> 07:03.654
- Mr. Adams...
- You won't.

07:03.709 --> 07:05.569
Or found evidence,

07:05.763 --> 07:07.053
physical evidence

07:07.300 --> 07:09.776
that placed you
at the crime scene...

07:10.272 --> 07:12.424
Like a strand of your hair.

07:13.334 --> 07:16.063
Well, then, everything
that you've said today,

07:16.079 --> 07:17.444
recorded here

07:17.678 --> 07:18.827
on tape,

07:19.709 --> 07:21.803
that would start to unwind,
wouldn't it?

07:22.140 --> 07:23.732
Would look bad for you in court.

07:24.180 --> 07:25.912
Physical evidence?

07:27.592 --> 07:29.264
- Really?
- Mn-

07:31.977 --> 07:33.180
Harry.

07:33.592 --> 07:35.580
Ooh. Something's up.

07:37.632 --> 07:39.795
Interview suspended,
twelve thirty-two.

07:46.444 --> 07:47.724
You need to let her go.

07:48.232 --> 07:49.282
What?

07:49.540 --> 07:50.839
We don't have it.

07:51.334 --> 07:52.389
The hair,

07:52.920 --> 07:53.965
the evidence,

07:54.853 --> 07:56.805
it's been lost between here
and the crime scene.

07:56.820 --> 07:58.412
Lost? What? Ho, how?

07:58.523 --> 08:01.874
I don't know, but right now we have
nothing else to hold her.

08:03.014 --> 08:04.193
How does a piece of evidence

08:04.209 --> 08:05.826
go missing?
My whole line of questioning

08:05.842 --> 08:07.662
- is based on that bloody hair...
- I know!

08:09.928 --> 08:12.127
Look she's laughing at us,
Harry. Get rid of her.

08:12.220 --> 08:13.620
Then come and find me.

08:24.419 --> 08:28.084
Is this the bit where you let me go
and apologise for wasting my time?

08:28.570 --> 08:30.576
This officer will escort you back

08:30.940 --> 08:33.857
to the custody suite where
you'll be asked to sign a release form.

08:35.169 --> 08:36.246
Very good.

08:43.369 --> 08:44.951
Don't be a stranger, Harry.

08:55.342 --> 08:56.377
Harry.

08:57.615 --> 08:58.669
Just Harry.

09:02.302 --> 09:04.062
Are you sure it's Lily-Anne?

09:05.350 --> 09:08.133
Well, it's gonna be hard to make it
stick now the hair's gone.

09:09.498 --> 09:11.864
But, she did it alright. I know her.

09:11.880 --> 09:13.999
Evidence doesn't simply
'go missing'.

09:14.015 --> 09:15.978
The only way it could have
disappeared is if she got

09:16.002 --> 09:18.245
- someone to get rid of it.
- Someone?

09:18.709 --> 09:19.566
Someone who?

09:19.582 --> 09:21.607
You heard what she said
in that interview.

09:22.693 --> 09:25.165
She's got 'friends' here.

09:27.014 --> 09:28.732
In this department.

09:31.977 --> 09:34.045
I think one of our officers is bent.

09:36.862 --> 09:38.365
We carry on as normal.

09:39.712 --> 09:42.990
You continue to investigate the
murder, I'll dig around here.

09:43.006 --> 09:44.631
Who do you trust?
Without question?

09:44.715 --> 09:45.715
Suri.

09:45.880 --> 09:46.880
So brief her.

09:47.186 --> 09:48.517
No-one else.

09:48.682 --> 09:50.176
Okay.

09:50.551 --> 09:52.107
Sorry to interrupt.

09:52.435 --> 09:55.021
Sir, we just got the police records
for Sam Browning.

09:55.037 --> 09:57.196
The guy who owns the building
where we found the body.

09:57.373 --> 10:00.036
Twenty-seven years old,
multiple arrests for

10:00.051 --> 10:02.996
prostitution, various drug and
alcohol related offences.

10:03.011 --> 10:05.584
Not your, not your typical
homeowner?

10:06.171 --> 10:08.756
Apparently left the property
by one of his sugar daddies.

10:08.771 --> 10:09.913
Thanks.

10:10.155 --> 10:11.647
Where were you last night?

10:15.318 --> 10:17.478
Err, I was in Soho as it goes.

10:18.407 --> 10:19.523
Doing?

10:19.611 --> 10:21.522
Just out with a mate,
nothing special.

10:21.971 --> 10:24.550
And you can get this mate to
corroborate, you know?

10:25.211 --> 10:27.686
Yeah. Yeah of course. Why? Sir?

10:27.811 --> 10:30.953
I'm asking everyone, Steve.
Just a bit of procedure.

10:32.193 --> 10:33.196
Okay.

10:33.342 --> 10:34.927
- Thanks.
- No problem.

10:36.171 --> 10:38.240
Go find Sam Browning, Harry.

11:09.071 --> 11:10.537
So, what did she say, exactly?

11:11.802 --> 11:13.657
Something about punishing the guilty.

11:14.240 --> 11:15.716
You just let her walk away.

11:15.731 --> 11:18.053
What else was I supposed to do?
Arrest her? For what?

11:18.731 --> 11:20.099
So now, she's...

11:20.115 --> 11:21.115
Yeah.

11:21.951 --> 11:23.457
She's out there, somewhere.

11:25.411 --> 11:26.931
What about Daisy or Anna?

11:27.731 --> 11:29.116
She won't hurt them.

11:29.311 --> 11:31.076
Not after what happened
to her own daughters.

11:31.091 --> 11:32.678
I hope so!

11:34.272 --> 11:35.389
So it's me.

11:36.186 --> 11:38.066
In her eye's I'm the guilty one!

11:52.857 --> 11:53.615
<i>Yeah?</i>

11:53.631 --> 11:55.236
Yeah, hello. It's Steve Orwell.

11:55.251 --> 11:56.357
I was here last night.

11:58.077 --> 11:59.477
Can you buzz me up? Yeah.

12:13.317 --> 12:14.428
What happened?

12:17.171 --> 12:18.600
What happened? Where did,

12:18.850 --> 12:20.596
where did they go? Alan and Tom.

12:20.755 --> 12:21.955
There's no one here.

12:21.971 --> 12:23.552
Yeah, I see that. Where, where have
they gone?

12:23.568 --> 12:25.928
This place been empty
for three months.

12:27.533 --> 12:28.842
No, no no.

12:28.936 --> 12:31.076
I, I, came here last night.

12:32.740 --> 12:35.428
To see, Alan Philips and Tom Lynch.
Right here.

12:43.491 --> 12:47.451
Ed, I want you to bring anything
your SOCOs turn up straight to me.

12:47.840 --> 12:48.856
No one else.

12:48.982 --> 12:50.730
Yes, Detective Superintendent.

12:50.811 --> 12:51.939
What else?

12:52.615 --> 12:55.373
We've collected some
fiber samples by the door,

12:55.924 --> 12:57.889
we don't know if
they belong to the murderer yet.

13:00.134 --> 13:01.831
It's not easy with this mess...

13:02.873 --> 13:04.045
I can see.

13:04.981 --> 13:06.700
- Try anyway.
- Sir.

13:08.377 --> 13:09.737
And the murder weapon?

13:17.056 --> 13:19.217
It was found
wrapped in a police glove.

13:20.979 --> 13:23.178
Dumped for later retrieval,
I'd imagine.

13:24.685 --> 13:26.830
Looks like it's been wiped clean.

13:27.147 --> 13:29.467
Maybe we'll find something
at the lab.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.792
<i>The number you have dialed
is not in service.</i>

16:14.253 --> 16:16.729
Police. You out. You two go.

16:17.596 --> 16:18.762
Not you.

16:19.043 --> 16:20.996
- Sam Browning!
- How d'you find me?

16:21.012 --> 16:23.357
This is the fifth place I've looked
and I am getting angry!

16:23.371 --> 16:25.836
- Why are you hiding Sam?
- What do you want?

16:25.852 --> 16:27.596
Is this something to do with
Lily-Anne Lau?

16:27.611 --> 16:30.089
- No! No, I'm just... I'm detoxing.
- Like bollocks you are.

16:32.120 --> 16:34.308
I've got a dead body in a property
that you own.

16:34.331 --> 16:36.157
- I didn't do it, I swear.
- Then who did?

16:36.172 --> 16:37.956
Why do you think I'm stuck
in this shit hole?

16:37.972 --> 16:39.589
Was it Lily-Anne Lau?

16:40.049 --> 16:42.419
Right. Well let's go and talk to her.
She's not a cop.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.076
No, don't, she'll kill me!

16:44.091 --> 16:45.596
She's a pussy-cat.

16:45.731 --> 16:46.971
She cut his throat!

16:46.987 --> 16:48.464
I was there I saw it!

16:50.940 --> 16:52.005
Why?

16:52.166 --> 16:54.135
'Cos she wanted the property,
of course.

16:54.550 --> 16:55.895
It's yours, not his.

16:56.293 --> 16:58.268
Yeah but he was gonna buy it, wasn't
he?

16:59.429 --> 17:00.620
And?

17:02.491 --> 17:05.156
About three months ago, Lily-Anne
started getting all chummy.

17:05.665 --> 17:08.625
I didn't get it, but I didn't ask
why either, so now I'm in

17:08.893 --> 17:12.487
her casino, chucking chips around,
she's like - have fun, don't worry -

17:12.643 --> 17:14.556
before I know it,
I'm like fifty grand down.

17:14.570 --> 17:15.659
And she wants it back.

17:16.971 --> 17:19.675
So she says, give me the property
and I'll wipe the slate clean.

17:19.691 --> 17:21.435
For fifty grand? Bollocks that place
is worth.

17:21.451 --> 17:22.816
Loads more. Yeah.

17:23.473 --> 17:25.473
And she, she scares me, man.

17:25.491 --> 17:27.898
So I just thought - get rid of it,
get her off my case.

17:29.355 --> 17:31.152
And I meet this guy Dean.

17:31.285 --> 17:32.699
At her Casino.

17:33.051 --> 17:36.436
He did something in property, say's
he'll buy the place off me

17:36.451 --> 17:37.756
for two and a half.

17:37.771 --> 17:38.894
Million.

17:39.637 --> 17:41.275
Lily-Anne didn't like that.

17:41.426 --> 17:43.676
So she killed him to stop him
buying your place.

17:44.004 --> 17:45.941
And to make me sign it over to her.

17:46.403 --> 17:48.363
She made me do it right then, with him

17:48.724 --> 17:50.574
gasping and spluttering on the floor.

17:51.934 --> 17:54.480
He was dying, lying there,
looking at me and she just

17:54.496 --> 17:56.189
shoved a pen in my hand and...

17:58.530 --> 18:00.277
I'm the only bloody witness,
aren't I?

18:01.087 --> 18:03.929
I signed it and then, when she was
checking it, I pegged it.

18:04.771 --> 18:06.440
Dead man walking, that's me.

18:06.456 --> 18:08.016
Not with me, you're not.

18:10.211 --> 18:11.596
You don't understand...

18:11.611 --> 18:14.113
It's alright. You'll be safe with me
at the station.

19:03.153 --> 19:04.544
I hate you.

19:08.113 --> 19:09.644
My best friend.

19:10.287 --> 19:12.435
Do you remember how
we used to be?

19:12.552 --> 19:13.755
Sharing everything.

19:13.933 --> 19:15.591
Sisters almost.

19:19.126 --> 19:21.154
You loved me so much you gave me

19:21.170 --> 19:23.708
the most incredible gift.

19:24.701 --> 19:26.912
You kissed me on the cheek and then
you...

19:27.857 --> 19:29.916
sealed it around my wrist.

19:30.451 --> 19:33.529
And now I have nothing.

19:34.207 --> 19:36.087
Since you took Harry from me.

19:37.767 --> 19:40.880
You had to make sure I had nothing
didn't you?

19:44.287 --> 19:46.818
We are in the bowels of my building.

19:50.887 --> 19:52.824
If you're lucky,

19:52.840 --> 19:55.607
the caretaker might
find you in time.

19:56.127 --> 19:59.904
Or he might hear you
struggling to break free.

20:02.429 --> 20:04.267
Or he might be out all day.

20:04.911 --> 20:06.661
It's all down to luck.

20:10.080 --> 20:11.419
You live by it.

20:13.493 --> 20:14.841
You die by it.

20:29.364 --> 20:33.039
The shooter fired - thirty rounds,
the kid didn't stand a chance.

20:34.296 --> 20:36.047
How are you still standing...

20:37.173 --> 20:38.557
- You want to go home?
- No.

20:40.204 --> 20:41.204
No.

20:43.201 --> 20:44.609
Any news on the missing hair?

20:48.687 --> 20:52.686
I checked a list of officers who
visited the evidence room yesterday.

20:52.702 --> 20:54.522
I think that's where the hair was
stolen.

20:55.672 --> 20:57.512
Steve Orwell's name was there.

20:58.567 --> 20:59.992
That doesn't mean he did it!

21:00.007 --> 21:01.866
There's no reason for him
to go there.

21:03.435 --> 21:04.866
Come on, he was demoted

21:05.084 --> 21:06.296
for this sort of thing.

21:06.499 --> 21:08.226
And he has a history with Lily-Anne

21:08.242 --> 21:09.609
she was his informant.

21:10.590 --> 21:12.509
Now it looks like she's turned him.

21:14.247 --> 21:15.436
Well, let's talk to him.

21:16.097 --> 21:17.346
He's disappeared.

21:18.405 --> 21:19.432
No explanation.

21:19.447 --> 21:21.102
Hasn't answered his phone.

21:22.092 --> 21:23.220
Vanished.

21:32.647 --> 21:34.672
- Anna.
- Hi.

21:34.687 --> 21:36.152
Now that's a surprise.

21:37.677 --> 21:39.377
I had a blazing row with Harry.

21:39.393 --> 21:41.178
I'm sorry to hear that.

21:41.248 --> 21:43.473
Well he told me
to stay away from you.

21:44.037 --> 21:45.313
So here I am.

21:45.392 --> 21:47.089
You might need a drink?

21:47.696 --> 21:49.702
I just poured myself one.

21:49.942 --> 21:52.421
What a beautiful place.

21:52.507 --> 21:53.775
Thank you.

21:54.444 --> 21:55.639
Hum!

21:56.639 --> 21:59.374
Must have taken you ages
to get it just right.

22:05.124 --> 22:06.655
How long have you been here?

22:07.245 --> 22:08.358
Cheers.

22:09.022 --> 22:10.205
How's Jonny?

22:10.529 --> 22:12.311
He's fine. So...? How long?

22:12.568 --> 22:14.428
Well...

22:15.366 --> 22:16.764
a few months, I suppose.

22:17.915 --> 22:19.699
Straight after Guatemala then.

22:22.486 --> 22:23.850
I've got this friend.

22:24.092 --> 22:25.530
He works in Border Control.

22:25.759 --> 22:27.661
And I was asking him about you.

22:28.271 --> 22:29.569
- Really?
- Hum!

22:30.913 --> 22:33.053
Anyway he did some digging for me.

22:33.069 --> 22:36.350
And erm, well here's you

22:36.651 --> 22:38.249
fresh from the flight,

22:38.265 --> 22:40.139
and there,

22:41.013 --> 22:42.568
on your wrist

22:43.920 --> 22:45.303
is that bracelet!

22:50.130 --> 22:52.155
The one you said was a present
from Harry.

22:55.593 --> 22:57.417
Harry says it gives him luck.

22:58.889 --> 23:00.608
And it curses him too.

23:02.868 --> 23:04.013
Are you gonna say the same?

23:04.029 --> 23:05.030
Yes.

23:06.838 --> 23:09.837
My daughter believes in it too,
that bracelet.

23:11.250 --> 23:13.008
But then she's thirteen.

23:15.335 --> 23:16.749
So I was,

23:17.187 --> 23:19.780
just wondering whether
you might like to tell me,

23:19.909 --> 23:21.702
what is really going on?

23:25.796 --> 23:27.179
Cos you seem

23:29.061 --> 23:30.194
perfect!

23:32.497 --> 23:33.651
Perfect?!

23:37.170 --> 23:38.264
Gosh.

23:38.539 --> 23:41.586
My daughters would
have been around Daisy's age.

23:44.283 --> 23:46.043
Course they're perfectly dead.

23:50.563 --> 23:52.032
Perfect.

23:52.688 --> 23:54.351
Perfect.

23:57.180 --> 24:00.477
What is perfect,

24:00.633 --> 24:01.891
Anna?

24:05.053 --> 24:08.548
Harry still tries
to think that his life,

24:08.564 --> 24:11.774
can be perfectly normal.

24:15.134 --> 24:16.454
Bless him.

24:17.446 --> 24:20.418
Still clings on to that hope.

24:23.914 --> 24:25.274
Five bullets.

24:26.790 --> 24:28.282
Five chambers.

24:36.541 --> 24:38.758
Now you can tell yourself that this

24:39.688 --> 24:41.118
is a magician's trick.

24:47.795 --> 24:52.020
And you can ignore everything
that your delectable husband

24:52.175 --> 24:53.477
has been trying to tell you.

24:56.563 --> 24:59.766
And you can tell yourself
that I am

25:00.603 --> 25:01.962
perfectly mad,

25:02.385 --> 25:05.364
- a gambler, just like him.
- Please don't.

25:07.338 --> 25:08.407
But

25:09.847 --> 25:10.899
Anna.

25:13.016 --> 25:14.416
Dear Anna.

25:15.450 --> 25:18.556
Never, ever, ever

25:19.032 --> 25:21.212
call me perfect.

26:39.644 --> 26:41.712
If this bracelet won't let me go,
I don't see

26:41.728 --> 26:43.357
why you should get away so easily.

26:45.938 --> 26:47.419
I haven't forgiven you

26:48.337 --> 26:49.486
but

26:50.579 --> 26:54.017
you're my only witness.

26:56.466 --> 26:58.804
I'm gonna drag you with me,
this life you gave me...

27:00.828 --> 27:02.013
Make me a promise.

27:03.251 --> 27:04.525
Promise me,

27:05.594 --> 27:06.894
when I die,

27:07.579 --> 27:09.594
you'll destroy this bracelet.

27:10.374 --> 27:13.227
Don't hurt someone else
the way you've hurt me.

27:13.672 --> 27:14.930
Yes?

27:16.999 --> 27:18.164
Yes.

27:21.470 --> 27:23.621
Harry thinks it's finished.

27:25.915 --> 27:27.087
He'll see.

27:28.907 --> 27:30.008
He'll see.

27:36.210 --> 27:38.118
I wasn't sure if you'd come.

27:41.117 --> 27:42.454
I didn't do it.

27:43.944 --> 27:46.305
I wouldn't have told you
I was here if I had.

27:47.656 --> 27:49.318
I couldn't look you in the eye.

27:49.391 --> 27:51.399
That's exactly what you'd say
if you had.

27:51.943 --> 27:53.064
Jesus?

27:55.774 --> 27:57.485
Why'd you bring me here then?

27:58.728 --> 28:02.028
Well I knew if I called, you'd be
less likely to answer.

28:02.044 --> 28:03.173
I'm being set up.

28:05.127 --> 28:06.992
I swear when I said I was in Soho?

28:07.008 --> 28:08.219
I was.

28:08.756 --> 28:11.579
The only reason I didn't say more
was because,

28:13.587 --> 28:15.624
because I was there
for a job interview.

28:17.186 --> 28:19.133
So I go to see these guys, okay.

28:19.500 --> 28:22.383
There talking about this big
security firm, they have.

28:23.112 --> 28:24.472
They know all about me.

28:25.597 --> 28:28.149
I go back the next day to
corroborate my story,

28:28.284 --> 28:29.680
and they've disappeared.

28:30.127 --> 28:32.696
So you have no alibi for the night
of the murder.

28:34.686 --> 28:37.102
Then I noticed my key card
has been stolen.

28:37.657 --> 28:39.353
I mean you have that,
you swipe that.

28:39.368 --> 28:40.891
I'm... anywhere you want me to be.

28:41.584 --> 28:44.156
I see that that's missing, I hear
that Lily-Anne is involved -

28:44.172 --> 28:46.040
and I know I'm being framed.

28:46.917 --> 28:48.583
And yeah I know, I shouldn't have run,

28:48.599 --> 28:49.912
I know how that looks.

28:50.017 --> 28:51.701
But Winter will arrest me
on the spot.

28:51.717 --> 28:52.837
He's got no choice.

28:54.475 --> 28:55.623
Harry.

28:57.755 --> 29:00.432
I know what I've done to you
and I...

29:01.849 --> 29:04.287
I'm sorry, maybe they should have

29:04.686 --> 29:06.792
put me away not just demoted me.

29:07.013 --> 29:09.888
But I've tried to make amends.
I've been trying all year.

29:12.833 --> 29:14.121
I'm not bent!

29:16.072 --> 29:17.630
I didn't do this!

29:21.197 --> 29:22.224
Okay.

29:29.141 --> 29:30.526
So where do we start?

29:31.779 --> 29:34.544
Let's get a list of all the officers
who were at the murder scene.

29:34.560 --> 29:36.365
See if they've any links to Lily-Anne,

29:36.381 --> 29:37.552
and find out,

29:37.568 --> 29:39.880
who else was in the evidence room
that day.

29:39.958 --> 29:41.224
I'm on it.

29:42.014 --> 29:43.857
So why are you trusting Steve?

29:44.215 --> 29:46.033
After everything he's done to you.

29:46.848 --> 29:47.903
Well.

29:49.435 --> 29:52.047
Maybe everyone deserves
a second chance.

29:52.360 --> 29:54.108
No matter what they've done.

29:55.505 --> 29:58.008
Let's just keep out of Winter's way,
right?

30:07.906 --> 30:09.208
Where have you been?

30:10.068 --> 30:12.313
Trying to find out
who killed Sam Browning.

30:13.560 --> 30:14.567
Bullshit.

30:14.630 --> 30:16.997
Where's Orwell?
Don't lie to me, Harry.

30:17.013 --> 30:19.567
I just wanna know who the mole is
in our department.

30:19.583 --> 30:22.412
Where was Orwell
when the first murder happened?

30:22.428 --> 30:24.973
And where was Orwell when Sam got
shot?

30:24.989 --> 30:26.076
Because he wasn't here.

30:26.092 --> 30:27.154
I was there Alistair.

30:27.170 --> 30:30.951
Sir. You call me Sir, and you answer
my bloody question!

30:32.486 --> 30:33.747
He didn't do it.

30:35.818 --> 30:37.568
You know I could have you arrested.

30:38.264 --> 30:41.552
And Suri. For obstructing this
investigation.

30:41.568 --> 30:43.887
- Jesus.
- I trusted you!

30:45.092 --> 30:46.241
I told no one else.

30:46.257 --> 30:48.484
You are the one person
in this whole department

30:48.500 --> 30:50.538
and you spit this back in my face.

30:50.636 --> 30:52.661
You're chasing the wrong man.

30:52.848 --> 30:54.593
Where. Is. Orwell?

30:54.608 --> 30:57.046
- Why don't you trust me now?
- You went behind my back!

30:57.062 --> 30:59.089
This is what Lily-Anne Lau has done.

31:00.553 --> 31:02.139
Don't you see that?

31:02.265 --> 31:03.549
She's put someone in amongst us

31:03.565 --> 31:05.412
and now we're all fighting
against each other.

31:05.630 --> 31:08.015
It isn't Orwell.
So stop wasting my time.

31:08.031 --> 31:09.136
Don't you dare...

31:09.267 --> 31:10.541
Harry!

31:12.986 --> 31:14.944
You get back in here right now!

31:20.851 --> 31:22.132
Sorry about him.

31:22.304 --> 31:24.410
But I'm not
in a very good mood today.

31:25.045 --> 31:26.740
I knew you couldn't keep away.

31:27.688 --> 31:30.140
Is this about the tables, the cards,

31:30.843 --> 31:31.866
or me?

31:32.488 --> 31:33.882
This is all about you.

31:34.913 --> 31:36.796
You see I know what happened.

31:37.608 --> 31:40.553
How you coerced Sam into signing
over the property...

31:40.655 --> 31:43.460
killed a man in front of him to
scare the wits out of him.

31:43.476 --> 31:44.937
I'm talking to you!

31:46.892 --> 31:48.148
Get my car.

31:48.649 --> 31:49.723
I'm bored.

32:00.556 --> 32:03.609
See the thing is,
I don't remember any coercion.

32:04.939 --> 32:05.939
Sorry.

32:07.694 --> 32:09.101
Come on, Harry,

32:09.530 --> 32:12.163
you're not really here
about that silly boy, are you?

32:13.624 --> 32:15.545
I was there, when he died.

32:15.710 --> 32:16.757
I heard.

32:17.314 --> 32:20.351
You'd already got what you wanted.
You didn't have to kill him.

32:20.876 --> 32:21.890
Okay.

32:22.773 --> 32:24.187
On the plus side,

32:24.882 --> 32:27.665
I am going to turn
Sam's place in to a bar.

32:28.468 --> 32:30.143
You should come along, Harry.

32:31.155 --> 32:32.780
Have a complimentary drink

32:33.030 --> 32:34.684
and think about how you can never,

32:35.234 --> 32:36.472
ever beat me.

32:37.499 --> 32:39.866
It doesn't matter if you don't bet
anymore, Harry.

32:40.483 --> 32:42.184
The house never loses.

32:53.539 --> 32:56.015
I've got a list of everyone
who was at the crime scene

32:56.031 --> 32:57.940
and the evidence room, like you asked.

32:59.116 --> 33:00.827
Don't go up. Winter's gone mad.

33:00.843 --> 33:02.640
He's interviewing everyone, one by one.

33:03.186 --> 33:04.490
Right. Thanks.

33:05.099 --> 33:07.449
I can't believe one of our guys
would steal evidence.

33:07.499 --> 33:09.218
I just don't believe
a cop would do that.

33:09.379 --> 33:10.645
Neither can I.

33:15.978 --> 33:17.323
This list isn't complete.

33:17.339 --> 33:18.005
Yes it is.

33:18.215 --> 33:20.905
Every detective who worked at the
crime scene and the evidence room.

33:21.109 --> 33:22.499
Hum, every detective.

33:23.179 --> 33:24.585
What about the SOCOS?

33:43.419 --> 33:44.579
Hello, Inspector.

33:45.881 --> 33:48.600
Bloody hell, Ed, how many times
have I told you to call me Harry?

33:48.616 --> 33:51.266
Sorry. I'm a bit old-fashioned.
Harry.

33:51.619 --> 33:53.179
What brings you down here?

33:54.662 --> 33:56.187
Have you heard about Steve Orwell?

33:56.944 --> 33:58.390
I'd heard a rumour...

33:58.843 --> 33:59.883
is it true?

34:00.412 --> 34:01.913
He seemed like such a nice fella.

34:02.415 --> 34:03.480
They always do.

34:04.444 --> 34:06.923
The one thing I
can't work out is

34:07.796 --> 34:09.889
how he was able to hide
the murder weapon.

34:09.980 --> 34:12.561
He would have needed to be one of
the first officers on site.

34:13.132 --> 34:14.734
Otherwise it would have been

34:15.123 --> 34:16.483
photographed and logged,

34:17.081 --> 34:18.723
- right?
- Yeah, that's right.

34:20.054 --> 34:22.724
My guess is that Orwell must have
slipped the knife away

34:22.739 --> 34:25.145
when no one was looking.
Easily done?

34:25.170 --> 34:27.219
You know we're all so busy,
no ones really watching

34:27.235 --> 34:29.404
what anyone else is doing.
Am I right?

34:29.606 --> 34:30.809
I suppose so, yeah.

34:31.659 --> 34:33.547
Then he realises that

34:33.580 --> 34:35.963
he can't hide
Lily-Anne's hair because

34:36.053 --> 34:38.045
it's already been spotted. So,

34:39.346 --> 34:42.004
he waits until it gets in here
into the evidence room,

34:42.018 --> 34:43.123
pops in and steals it.

34:44.221 --> 34:46.799
The only mistake he made though was,

34:47.204 --> 34:48.603
he used his own key card.

34:49.659 --> 34:52.503
It as him logged as

34:52.994 --> 34:55.550
entering here at err...

34:56.148 --> 34:58.093
Got it. Eleven-forty-seven.

34:58.744 --> 35:00.204
Eleven-forty-seven.

35:00.440 --> 35:01.580
That's odd.

35:03.205 --> 35:04.975
I was sure he was with me...

35:06.224 --> 35:07.985
but if it says it here,
it must be right.

35:09.401 --> 35:10.938
So when did you come in?

35:14.579 --> 35:16.939
I mean. You must have been
in here all the time,

35:16.955 --> 35:18.674
as the Scene of Crime Manager.

35:19.019 --> 35:20.854
Yeah. I was. Of course.

35:23.619 --> 35:25.211
But you're not logged in.

35:26.425 --> 35:27.510
Anywhere.

35:29.291 --> 35:30.502
At all.

35:32.699 --> 35:35.004
He says he wasn't here.
His key card says he was.

35:35.019 --> 35:37.779
You say you were, but your key card
says not.

35:40.307 --> 35:42.010
Now that's a funny thing, isn't it?

35:45.482 --> 35:46.839
You're a clever man, Ed.

35:48.049 --> 35:51.041
I'm sure you don't have Orwell's key
card on you anymore.

35:51.369 --> 35:54.324
And the CCTV in the corridors might
not categorically prove that

35:54.339 --> 35:56.899
you were the only person who could
have stolen the evidence. But,

35:58.911 --> 36:00.033
I know.

36:02.314 --> 36:03.370
We both know.

36:04.586 --> 36:05.729
Don't we?

36:10.316 --> 36:11.323
Harry.

36:12.322 --> 36:13.487
I'm so sorry.

36:15.972 --> 36:17.957
I've never gambled. Not once.

36:18.550 --> 36:20.221
I'm a simple person, you know?

36:20.331 --> 36:21.940
Do things, do them properly.

36:24.955 --> 36:26.995
But my daughter is not the same.

36:28.558 --> 36:29.943
She says I'm so dull.

36:30.354 --> 36:32.461
Maybe I'm the reason she started.
I don't know.

36:33.964 --> 36:36.738
Either way, she bet and she lost.

36:37.956 --> 36:41.589
She bet and lost again and again
until she was in real trouble.

36:45.516 --> 36:48.381
And that's when they turned up on my
door, with her next to them,

36:48.396 --> 36:49.858
begging and sobbing.

36:52.423 --> 36:54.687
Just a few favours. Nothing big.

36:55.341 --> 36:58.666
Just show them some paperwork,
tell them things every now and then.

37:01.704 --> 37:03.861
I thought that would be it.
But of course it wasn't.

37:03.876 --> 37:05.308
Once I'd started,

37:06.144 --> 37:07.938
they had me good and proper.

37:12.791 --> 37:13.907
I'm so ashamed.

37:15.016 --> 37:17.251
I should have told you,
but I was scared for her,

37:17.267 --> 37:18.292
of what they would do.

37:18.380 --> 37:21.485
They told you to lose
evidence of Lily-Anne's hair?

37:21.844 --> 37:24.059
And then take Orwell's key card

37:24.075 --> 37:25.821
and use it to frame him.

37:26.370 --> 37:29.278
I just saw Orwell's jacket
on the chair and...

37:31.196 --> 37:32.415
God.

37:39.996 --> 37:41.899
Having betrayed this department...

37:41.983 --> 37:43.969
Will you testify to this in court?

37:44.905 --> 37:45.938
Yes.

37:46.251 --> 37:47.701
But I don't think
it will be enough.

37:47.716 --> 37:48.883
She'll deny it.

37:49.313 --> 37:51.305
And I can't prove
anything I've said.

37:52.102 --> 37:54.329
Not unless you get her
to say it on tape.

38:03.368 --> 38:05.524
Do you think McCarthy's
strong enough for this?

38:06.540 --> 38:08.438
He wants to make amends
as best he can,

38:09.070 --> 38:10.788
so I think it's a good plan, Sir.

38:13.036 --> 38:14.039
Okay.

38:14.710 --> 38:15.718
Harry.

38:22.885 --> 38:24.149
I got it wrong.

38:25.133 --> 38:26.255
About Orwell.

38:26.695 --> 38:27.773
Well you,

38:29.110 --> 38:30.382
you made a call

38:31.008 --> 38:32.328
based on what you knew.

38:32.485 --> 38:33.657
But so did you.

38:35.055 --> 38:36.360
You helped him.

38:36.899 --> 38:39.500
You worked together without me.

38:40.046 --> 38:41.385
To stop me.

38:42.766 --> 38:44.555
You should have
explained yourself.

38:46.586 --> 38:48.797
Helped me see your thinking.

38:48.996 --> 38:50.133
Trusted me.

38:51.859 --> 38:52.859
Go on,

38:53.977 --> 38:55.066
go get her.

38:57.916 --> 38:59.625
Right. Lets get going.

39:06.116 --> 39:07.541
Ok, Ed. We're all set.

39:07.556 --> 39:08.981
Right. Yeah.

39:08.996 --> 39:11.078
<i>In you go. We're listening.</i>

39:11.094 --> 39:13.251
Any sign of trouble, we'll be there
in seconds.

39:14.672 --> 39:16.710
Yes. Yes, you said yeah.

39:18.446 --> 39:20.133
I'm err, here to see Miss Lau.

39:20.374 --> 39:22.094
<i>It's err, Ed McCarthy.</i>

39:23.225 --> 39:24.310
Thank you.

39:35.957 --> 39:37.023
Ed.

39:37.780 --> 39:38.938
What a surprise.

39:39.806 --> 39:40.829
Yes.

39:43.016 --> 39:45.993
I wanted to tell you
it was all done.

39:47.677 --> 39:50.274
Well, whatever that is,

39:51.273 --> 39:52.727
you had a number to call.

39:53.895 --> 39:55.921
There was no need
to come see me in person.

39:59.919 --> 40:01.641
We're finished now, right?

40:02.999 --> 40:04.211
My debts are paid?

40:07.717 --> 40:08.899
For my daughter.

40:10.657 --> 40:12.140
I did what you asked.

40:12.156 --> 40:13.238
All of it.

40:14.505 --> 40:15.789
Come on Ed, say it.

40:16.921 --> 40:18.883
Spell it out, say it, come on.

40:19.445 --> 40:21.670
<i>I'm not sure I know
what you're talking about.</i>

40:21.686 --> 40:23.075
<i>My daughter's debts.</i>

40:23.916 --> 40:25.711
And the things you've made me do.

40:26.699 --> 40:27.727
Me?

40:29.706 --> 40:30.907
Really?

40:33.500 --> 40:34.500
Yes. You.

40:36.172 --> 40:38.419
You told me to steal
and destroy evidence...

40:55.610 --> 40:57.680
I think you have a fever

41:00.273 --> 41:02.548
and it's making you delirious.

41:07.952 --> 41:09.350
See I'm curious

41:10.094 --> 41:11.453
as to why you're here.

41:23.996 --> 41:26.676
I spy with my little eye...

41:29.156 --> 41:31.524
Please. Please...

41:34.258 --> 41:35.969
You have to understand.

41:36.409 --> 41:37.474
I had no choice!

41:38.137 --> 41:40.860
Do you hear me, please. Please.

41:46.798 --> 41:47.798
Please.

41:48.430 --> 41:51.602
- Car. Now!
- Don't let them hurt me.

41:51.618 --> 41:52.936
Lily-Anne.

41:54.116 --> 41:56.445
Ed McCarthy. The SOCO guy.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.664
I don't know what he's told the police,

41:58.680 --> 42:00.370
but it's the last thing he'll ever say.

42:01.007 --> 42:02.134
Kill him!

42:23.676 --> 42:24.462
Yes?

42:24.477 --> 42:27.813
Lily-Anne Lau, I'm arresting you
for conspiracy to murder.

42:28.047 --> 42:30.055
You know, you really should be
careful whose phone you're using

42:30.071 --> 42:31.710
when you arrange a murder.

42:35.486 --> 42:36.586
Lets go!

43:00.036 --> 43:01.221
Did the swap work?

43:01.236 --> 43:02.930
Yeah. Worked a charm.

43:39.036 --> 43:40.164
- Feel good?
- Yeah.

43:40.180 --> 43:42.484
You wouldn't get that feeling
working at a security firm.

43:42.802 --> 43:44.844
Probably get a shed-load more
holiday, though.

43:44.860 --> 43:47.157
We need you here. I need you.

43:47.447 --> 43:50.657
Forget the transfer and the other
jobs. Stay. Please?

43:53.334 --> 43:54.408
Okay.

43:59.757 --> 44:01.993
I'm not sure about this.

44:02.188 --> 44:03.637
A room full of cops?

44:03.716 --> 44:05.430
Like you've got a better offer?

44:05.922 --> 44:08.500
There's gonna be loads of arm
wrestling and tit jokes, isn't there?

44:08.516 --> 44:10.000
Yeah, that's just the women.

44:10.204 --> 44:11.712
Come on it'll be fun.

44:11.840 --> 44:13.578
And what about... you know.

44:14.201 --> 44:15.201
Your women.

44:16.397 --> 44:17.805
I haven't heard a thing.

44:18.926 --> 44:20.672
You know I keep waiting,

44:21.711 --> 44:24.078
expecting I'm gonna turn round
and she's there.

44:24.094 --> 44:25.430
With an axe?

44:25.446 --> 44:26.774
Or a machine gun or...

44:28.844 --> 44:30.414
Maybe she's just gone.

44:31.036 --> 44:34.797
Yeah. Finally realised you're not
worth mooning about?

44:35.000 --> 44:36.250
Good girl.

44:37.454 --> 44:38.477
Yeah.

44:41.468 --> 44:44.235
Hello pretty boy,
couple of Bushmills.

44:45.076 --> 44:46.477
Wow. You celebrating?

44:46.556 --> 44:47.556
Too right.

44:47.947 --> 44:49.054
Hi Steve...

44:52.676 --> 44:53.676
Too success!

44:54.047 --> 44:55.047
Right.

45:14.970 --> 45:16.410
I got your calling card.

45:17.539 --> 45:19.515
That's why you're sleeping with
Winter?

45:19.530 --> 45:21.275
To gain access to our case files?

45:21.290 --> 45:23.915
It's what the bracelets are for,
Harry.

45:23.930 --> 45:24.995
You're a psychopath.

45:25.133 --> 45:26.515
Could we be any luckier?

45:26.530 --> 45:29.650
This carries on we're gonna win,
Clean Up Rate of the Year award.

45:30.370 --> 45:33.355
Eve, I need you to track
the location of a phone.

45:33.370 --> 45:34.316
Give me 24 hours.

45:34.331 --> 45:35.690
You have got 5 minutes.

45:36.282 --> 45:38.002
I know why you killed him.

45:41.050 --> 45:43.810
Show yourself! I know you're here!
