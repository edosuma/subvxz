<i>The first thing
you'll do,</i>

00:32.567 --> 00:34.500
<i>very first thing.</i>

00:34.502 --> 00:36.434
<i>I'll look up at the sky.</i>

00:36.436 --> 00:38.269
<i>Will it be day or night?</i>

00:38.271 --> 00:39.571
Nighttime.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.710
With a big round
silver moon.

00:42.375 --> 00:45.110
What will you do, Vivien,
in your new home?

00:45.112 --> 00:47.779
Well, I'll look up
at the moon,

00:47.781 --> 00:48.714
right beside you.

00:48.716 --> 00:51.217
Because when I get chosen
I'll tell them

00:51.219 --> 00:54.119
I'm not going unless
you take Sophia, too.

00:54.121 --> 00:56.821
Don't you ever worry that
you won't get a good family?

00:56.823 --> 00:58.156
Are you kidding?

00:58.158 --> 00:59.791
I'll be the first girl chosen.

01:33.894 --> 01:37.231
<i>♪ My
baby kissed me good night</i>

01:38.698 --> 01:41.670
<i>♪ And I'm glad to relate</i>

01:42.802 --> 01:46.108
<i>♪ By the time I got home</i>

01:47.474 --> 01:50.111
<i>♪ I was feeling great</i>

01:51.444 --> 01:55.514
<i>♪ I climbed up the door
And opened the stairs</i>

01:55.516 --> 01:58.350
<i>♪ Said my pajamas
And put...</i>

01:58.352 --> 02:00.322
Hey!
My jar.

02:01.188 --> 02:02.954
Viv! Viv!

02:02.956 --> 02:04.856
Get up, Vee!
You'll miss your spot.

02:04.858 --> 02:07.294
My jar.
Can you see it?

02:09.864 --> 02:11.729
Vivien, it's your turn!

02:11.731 --> 02:12.764
It's your turn!

02:12.766 --> 02:14.799
<i>♪ ...Shined up an egg</i>

02:14.801 --> 02:16.501
<i>♪ Then I toasted the news</i>

02:17.471 --> 02:18.904
I'm here.
I'm right here!

02:23.911 --> 02:26.377
I'm clean! I'm clean!
Look at me!

02:26.379 --> 02:27.781
Look at me!

02:30.617 --> 02:32.219
Sophia, tell them!

02:32.787 --> 02:34.453
Don't let them hurt me.

02:34.455 --> 02:36.621
Cynthia, tell them
it was a mistake.

02:36.623 --> 02:38.756
Sophia,
tell them I did it right.

02:38.758 --> 02:40.261
Vee...

02:40.760 --> 02:44.262
It's a mistake!
I'm clean! I'm clean!

02:44.264 --> 02:46.264
No, please.
I'm clean.

02:46.266 --> 02:47.600
Tell them I did it right.

02:47.602 --> 02:49.768
Please!
Sophia!

02:49.770 --> 02:52.004
I'm clean!
I'm clean!

02:55.643 --> 02:57.576
<i>Don't take me!</i>

03:07.722 --> 03:09.554
<i>A clean girl
is always attentive</i>

03:09.556 --> 03:10.455
<i>and dutiful.</i>

03:10.457 --> 03:12.423
<i>A clean girl embraces...</i>

03:12.425 --> 03:13.524
Obedience.

03:13.526 --> 03:15.960
<i>A clean girl is always humble
and patient.</i>

03:15.962 --> 03:18.030
<i>A clean girl embodies...</i>

03:18.032 --> 03:19.131
Sweetness!

03:19.133 --> 03:21.733
<i>A clean girl
is always fit and temperate.</i>

03:21.735 --> 03:22.935
<i>A clean girl...</i>

03:30.443 --> 03:31.812
Vivien...

03:32.680 --> 03:34.316
should we report it?

03:38.586 --> 03:41.720
Does this mean
that class is over?

03:41.722 --> 03:43.922
Maybe we should go back
to our rooms or...

03:43.924 --> 03:46.361
We wait for the buzzer,
Greta.

03:46.926 --> 03:48.596
All of us.

03:54.001 --> 03:55.667
<i>...Honest
and forthcoming.</i>

03:55.669 --> 03:57.803
<i>A clean girl
gives the school...</i>

03:57.805 --> 03:59.004
Loyalty!

03:59.006 --> 04:00.138
<i>Very good, girls.</i>

04:00.140 --> 04:03.007
<i>Now, please prepare yourself
for a short lecture.</i>

04:08.915 --> 04:11.252
- Good night.
- Good night.

04:45.119 --> 04:46.788
Vivien?

04:48.822 --> 04:50.658
Yes?

04:51.358 --> 04:53.992
You have to watch Greta.

04:53.994 --> 04:56.531
She's always asking questions.

04:58.999 --> 05:01.336
Go to sleep, Ava.

05:05.072 --> 05:07.007
Sleep well.

05:57.591 --> 05:59.026
<i>Assembly.</i>

06:18.446 --> 06:20.646
Good morning, girls.

06:20.648 --> 06:22.748
Good morning,
Miss Brixil!

06:22.750 --> 06:24.750
I have good news.

06:24.752 --> 06:28.519
As of today,
you have completed Level 15.

06:28.521 --> 06:32.459
And now you will all be
moving up to Level 16.

06:33.726 --> 06:36.764
Level 16 will be your
final year at Vestalis.

06:38.766 --> 06:40.899
You will soon be meeting
your new families.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.567
So remember your lessons.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.902
Embrace the feminine virtues
that we have taught you and...

06:44.904 --> 06:46.740
Eyes down!

06:48.809 --> 06:52.978
Now, I will give you
your new hall assignments.

06:52.980 --> 06:55.180
Beginning with Rose Hall.

06:58.918 --> 07:02.022
The following girls will now
move up to Rose Hall:

07:03.624 --> 07:07.495
Rita. Ava.
Vivien.

07:36.891 --> 07:39.527
Well, here we are.

07:51.838 --> 07:54.539
Big beds!
We get our own beds.

07:54.541 --> 07:55.841
New arrivals.

07:55.843 --> 07:57.976
Hi.
I'm Clara.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.945
You're Vivien, right?
I'm Hedy.

07:59.947 --> 08:02.079
We were both in
Lily Hall on Level 14.

08:02.081 --> 08:03.214
I'm Ava.

08:03.216 --> 08:05.819
This is Rita and Vivien.

08:11.190 --> 08:12.759
Viv?

08:19.699 --> 08:22.170
I want the last bed
in the first row.

08:24.704 --> 08:28.807
Each hall has its top girl
and in this hall it's me.

08:28.809 --> 08:31.977
Obedience.
Cleanliness.

08:31.979 --> 08:35.149
Patience.
Humility.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.249
No questions
and no complaining.

08:38.251 --> 08:40.120
Hmm?

08:54.701 --> 08:57.835
<i>Vitamins are necessary
for healthy, growing bodies.</i>

08:57.837 --> 08:59.871
<i>Vitamins prevent disease.</i>

08:59.873 --> 09:01.876
<i>Take your vitamin now.</i>

09:08.615 --> 09:11.749
<i>Vitamins are necessary
for healthy, growing bodies.</i>

09:11.751 --> 09:13.819
<i>Vitamins prevent disease.</i>

09:13.821 --> 09:15.822
<i>Take your vitamin now.</i>

09:25.966 --> 09:28.967
<i>Vitamins are necessary
for healthy, growing bodies...</i>

09:28.969 --> 09:30.905
Is something wrong?

09:31.739 --> 09:32.807
No.

09:55.696 --> 09:56.898
Mmm.

09:57.664 --> 09:59.166
Cabbage day.

10:03.169 --> 10:05.070
You knew that girl?

10:05.072 --> 10:06.941
Sophia?

10:09.375 --> 10:11.977
There's something
weird about her.

10:11.979 --> 10:14.146
She squints.

10:14.148 --> 10:15.914
She has bad eyesight.

10:17.451 --> 10:20.051
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

10:20.053 --> 10:22.153
<i>It's worse than Level 15!</i>

10:22.155 --> 10:25.190
<i>Anger is the second vice,
Clara.</i>

10:25.192 --> 10:28.392
- <i>I'm not angry.</i>
- <i>You sound angry to me.</i>

10:28.394 --> 10:30.695
<i>Does she sound angry
to you, Vivien?</i>

10:34.802 --> 10:37.071
I'm going to
the water closet.

11:36.163 --> 11:38.129
Cripes!

11:38.131 --> 11:39.966
I need to talk to you.

11:40.333 --> 11:41.900
Go back to Meal Break.

11:41.902 --> 11:43.403
Please.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.302
Get out of my way.

11:45.304 --> 11:47.805
No, I...
I know what you're thinking.

11:47.807 --> 11:50.378
That on Level 10 I...

11:54.914 --> 11:57.017
Don't ever!

11:58.284 --> 12:01.286
If you tell anyone
that I'm unclean...

12:01.288 --> 12:03.423
I wouldn't!
I just...

12:03.956 --> 12:06.223
I wanted to tell you
that I'm sorry.

12:06.225 --> 12:07.993
I never should've...

12:07.995 --> 12:09.464
<i>Assembly.</i>

12:24.845 --> 12:26.044
Good day, girls.

12:26.046 --> 12:27.982
Good morning,
Miss Brixil!

12:30.583 --> 12:34.018
Level 16 is not like
the other levels.

12:34.020 --> 12:37.055
All your training has
led up to this moment.

12:37.057 --> 12:39.257
Soon, our sponsors
will arrive to choose

12:39.259 --> 12:42.060
their new adopted daughters.

12:42.062 --> 12:43.328
But before you meet them,

12:43.330 --> 12:45.229
you will need to learn
a few things.

12:45.231 --> 12:47.165
For example,

12:47.167 --> 12:51.004
how to dress like the daughter
of a top society family.

12:56.309 --> 12:57.444
Grace.

12:58.144 --> 12:59.980
This one is for you.

13:02.416 --> 13:04.152
You can look at me.

13:09.956 --> 13:11.323
- For me?
- Yes.

13:11.325 --> 13:13.060
Yes, come get it!

13:20.033 --> 13:21.932
What does it say?

13:21.934 --> 13:24.069
It spells "Grace".

13:24.071 --> 13:25.603
There's one here
for each of you.

13:25.605 --> 13:27.339
But listen carefully.

13:27.341 --> 13:30.041
The dresses are to be hung
by your beds this evening.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.408
Let them air out.

13:31.410 --> 13:33.313
We don't want wrinkles,
do we?

13:34.214 --> 13:36.513
You can wear them
all day tomorrow.

13:36.515 --> 13:38.883
And for a special treat,

13:38.885 --> 13:41.855
you can also wear them to bed
tomorrow evening.

13:43.557 --> 13:46.257
Consider this a reward...

13:46.259 --> 13:48.229
for virtuous behavior.

13:52.666 --> 13:54.666
Vvv...

13:54.668 --> 13:57.969
Vviv...

13:57.971 --> 13:59.170
Viv...

13:59.172 --> 14:01.672
Have you ever seen
anything so spiffy?

14:01.674 --> 14:05.009
It looks just like the ladies
from Moving Picture Night.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.111
When I'm adopted,

14:06.113 --> 14:08.246
I'll wear swell dresses
all the time.

14:08.248 --> 14:12.349
And we can go outside
where the air is clean

14:12.351 --> 14:14.551
and we can look at the moon.

14:24.597 --> 14:26.900
- Good night.
- Good night.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.910
Good night, Vivien.

14:40.013 --> 14:42.147
Good night, Ava.

14:42.149 --> 14:44.715
I bet you'll
get the best placement.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.654
I bet you'll get a great
family who will love you.

14:50.023 --> 14:52.259
Sleep well.

15:21.388 --> 15:23.988
But what if we meet
the families

15:23.990 --> 15:25.723
and we don't get chosen?

15:25.725 --> 15:27.392
Don't be silly, Clara.

15:27.394 --> 15:29.227
They'll choose you right away.

15:29.229 --> 15:31.396
You're the prettiest girl
in Rose Hall.

15:40.307 --> 15:43.273
Audrey,
can we switch chores?

15:43.275 --> 15:44.776
I'm sweeping the classroom.

15:44.778 --> 15:47.414
Are you kidding? Yes!

15:49.515 --> 15:51.084
Thanks.

15:54.488 --> 15:57.789
- Viv.
- You volunteered for wash duty.

15:57.791 --> 15:59.961
So wash.

16:00.192 --> 16:02.459
You asked me
not to tell and...

16:02.461 --> 16:04.262
I... I won't.

16:04.264 --> 16:05.597
I never would.

16:05.599 --> 16:09.300
But I need you to
keep a secret, too.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.639
- I don't want any trouble.
- No. Listen.

16:16.043 --> 16:18.243
I'm going to
tell you something

16:18.245 --> 16:20.244
and I need you
to promise me

16:20.246 --> 16:22.680
that I could really,
truly trust you.

16:22.682 --> 16:25.116
Obedience.
Cleanliness...

16:25.118 --> 16:26.383
I need you
to listen to me!

16:26.385 --> 16:29.186
I follow the rules!

16:29.188 --> 16:31.156
And soon
I will be chosen, so...

16:31.158 --> 16:33.527
Don't take the vitamins.

16:34.827 --> 16:38.432
At Meal Break,
do not take the vitamins.

16:40.567 --> 16:42.434
You'll have
to pretend that you're...

16:42.436 --> 16:44.238
Vivien?

16:45.072 --> 16:47.171
I need help
changing the sheets.

16:47.173 --> 16:48.540
Sure.

16:48.542 --> 16:51.242
Yeah, I'll...
I'll be right there.

16:51.244 --> 16:53.447
Or you could come now.

16:55.649 --> 16:57.784
Sure.

17:03.123 --> 17:04.788
What's wrong with her?

17:04.790 --> 17:06.557
Nothing.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.662
Maybe she's unclean?

17:09.627 --> 17:11.796
Don't ever say that.

17:11.798 --> 17:13.397
No, I didn't mean...

17:13.400 --> 17:16.133
Is that why you always
follow me around?

17:16.135 --> 17:17.102
To spy on me?

17:17.104 --> 17:18.402
No!
I'm trying to help you.

17:18.404 --> 17:20.738
I don't need your help.

17:20.740 --> 17:23.708
I'm not your friend, Ava.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.480
There are no friends
in this place.

17:37.457 --> 17:40.557
<i>Vitamins are necessary
for healthy growing bodies.</i>

17:40.559 --> 17:42.594
<i>Vitamins prevent disease.</i>

17:42.596 --> 17:44.328
<i>Take your vitamin now.</i>

17:52.739 --> 17:55.907

17:55.909 --> 17:58.176
<i>Vitamins prevent disease.</i>

17:58.178 --> 18:00.081
<i>Take your vitamin now.</i>

18:03.215 --> 18:04.548
They're blue today.

18:04.550 --> 18:07.251
<i>Vitamins are necessary

18:07.253 --> 18:09.319

18:17.864 --> 18:21.165

18:21.167 --> 18:23.200
<i>Vitamins prevent disease.</i>

<i>Take your vitamin now.</i>

19:40.247 --> 19:41.916
Good night, Ava.

20:46.512 --> 20:48.381
Ava?

20:51.317 --> 20:52.984
Ava!

20:52.986 --> 20:55.022
<i>She won't wake up.</i>

21:01.594 --> 21:03.764
They never wake up.

21:04.596 --> 21:06.666
It's the vitamins.

21:07.834 --> 21:09.499
It keeps them asleep.

21:09.501 --> 21:11.902
The vitamins
keep us healthy!

21:11.904 --> 21:14.939
They protect us from
unclean air and dirty water.

21:14.941 --> 21:16.807
If the door opens,

21:16.809 --> 21:18.979
pretend you're in
deep sleep.

21:20.012 --> 21:22.947
- But if the guard comes...
- The guards?

21:22.949 --> 21:25.615
The... No, the guards
aren't allowed in here.

21:25.617 --> 21:27.751
If you need help,
call out.

21:27.753 --> 21:29.921
Or if I need help...

21:29.923 --> 21:31.892
Cripes!
They're coming!

21:45.805 --> 21:47.341
This one.

21:51.778 --> 21:53.447
And this one.

22:29.415 --> 22:30.783
Viv?

23:53.031 --> 23:54.701
Olivia?

24:04.076 --> 24:06.009
And here we are.

24:06.011 --> 24:08.214
These are the two
you asked to see...

24:09.816 --> 24:11.015
Olivia.

24:11.017 --> 24:15.151
She has a fresh look like
a breath of clean country air.

24:15.153 --> 24:17.523
The very picture of youth.

24:18.958 --> 24:22.496
She is lovely.

24:24.763 --> 24:27.064
And this is Vivien.

24:27.066 --> 24:29.267
Classic,
delicate features.

24:29.269 --> 24:31.672
Skin like rich cream.

24:31.904 --> 24:33.673
One in a million.

24:34.106 --> 24:35.773
Exquisite.

24:35.775 --> 24:37.578
Isn't she, dear?

24:42.749 --> 24:45.052
Would you like a glass
of champagne?

24:46.752 --> 24:48.788
Champagne, dear?

24:51.790 --> 24:53.056
Yeah.

24:53.058 --> 24:54.994
Yes, please.

25:01.701 --> 25:03.871
So perfect.

25:05.070 --> 25:10.042
Imagine, never damaged
by a single ray of sunlight.

25:11.310 --> 25:13.614
If you believe that.

25:14.212 --> 25:16.884
You said you wanted this.

25:17.616 --> 25:19.083
Why risk coming here
if you aren't...

25:19.085 --> 25:20.918
It's my choice.

25:20.920 --> 25:23.056
Yes, of course.

25:24.990 --> 25:27.160
But we've come
all this way...

25:32.965 --> 25:35.134
I'm not interrupting,
I hope...

25:36.068 --> 25:37.971
Mr. Denison?

25:43.009 --> 25:45.375
If you want to see
other options...

25:45.377 --> 25:46.879
No.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.983
We'll buy that one.

25:51.817 --> 25:53.116
Pay them.

25:53.118 --> 25:55.686
Haggle, if you wish,

25:55.688 --> 25:58.225
but I'm going back
to the hotel.

26:04.864 --> 26:07.097
I think we've made
our selection.

26:07.099 --> 26:08.766
Wonderful.

26:08.768 --> 26:10.971
Let me show you
to the office.

26:25.852 --> 26:27.653
This one.

26:28.221 --> 26:30.289
They're waiting for her!

26:57.950 --> 26:59.717
I don't think
they locked it.

26:59.719 --> 27:01.688
I didn't hear it lock!

27:02.888 --> 27:04.087
Are you okay?

27:04.089 --> 27:06.125
The sponsors.

27:07.993 --> 27:10.797
They don't want to adopt us.
They...

27:12.097 --> 27:14.198
they want to buy us.

27:14.200 --> 27:17.200
This is our only chance.
Brixil will be back soon...

27:17.202 --> 27:19.335
I...
I followed all the rules.

27:19.337 --> 27:21.072
- We have to go.
- Go where?

27:21.074 --> 27:22.739
- Outside.
- You're crazy!

27:22.741 --> 27:24.208
The is air
is poisonous outside.

27:24.210 --> 27:25.209
We can't.

27:25.211 --> 27:26.776
You don't understand
what's been happening.

27:26.778 --> 27:28.781
No.

27:29.347 --> 27:30.715
No.

27:30.717 --> 27:32.152
No, no...

27:38.490 --> 27:39.893
This one.

29:23.128 --> 29:24.764
I'm here.

29:25.431 --> 29:27.867
No, I'm almost done
with Rose Hall.

29:29.234 --> 29:32.038
A little bit of hand-holding
but no more than usual.

29:35.173 --> 29:36.942
<i>Just one problem.</i>

29:37.609 --> 29:41.578
Alex, I know.

29:41.580 --> 29:44.317
But I don't want him
on the floors unsupervised.

29:47.286 --> 29:49.089
I can't talk now.

29:49.321 --> 29:51.457
I want to stay here
until we finish Rose Hall.

30:01.067 --> 30:03.036
There's just one girl left.

30:03.935 --> 30:06.539
I'll come down before
we open Lily Hall.

30:07.640 --> 30:10.043
Yes. Okay.

32:10.663 --> 32:12.531
It's locked now.

32:14.432 --> 32:16.435
That was our only chance.

32:26.612 --> 32:29.412
When did you stop...

32:29.414 --> 32:31.216
with the vitamins?

32:32.684 --> 32:34.586
Level 13.

32:36.654 --> 32:38.625
You're lucky.

32:39.191 --> 32:43.192
- If any other girl had seen...
- I haven't told anyone else.

32:43.194 --> 32:45.528
Well, that's...

32:45.530 --> 32:47.334
good.

32:47.700 --> 32:49.400
Just keep your head down.

32:49.402 --> 32:52.205
- They're drugging us.
- It's wrong, I know!

32:53.806 --> 32:57.074
- Maybe there is a reason...
- You're defending them,

32:57.076 --> 32:59.211
after what they did to you?

33:00.078 --> 33:03.316
What "they" did to me?

33:27.807 --> 33:30.442
<i>Vivien.
Please enter.</i>

33:39.218 --> 33:41.421
Good morning, young lady.

33:43.122 --> 33:45.756
"Vitamins are necessary
for healthy growing bodies.

33:45.758 --> 33:48.424
Vitamins prevent disease."

33:48.426 --> 33:49.826
Please have a seat.

33:49.828 --> 33:52.161
I didn't think
you were real.

33:52.163 --> 33:55.565
I mean, I thought
you were just a voice.

33:55.567 --> 33:57.601
My name is Doctor Miro.

33:57.603 --> 34:00.336
I only deal with
the senior students.

34:00.338 --> 34:02.873
They need special attention.

34:02.875 --> 34:05.575
Vivien is a lovely name.

34:05.577 --> 34:08.244
One of my favorite
actresses is named Vivien.

34:08.246 --> 34:09.813
- Really?
- Just breathe normally.

34:09.815 --> 34:11.547
Okay.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.416
And out.

34:13.418 --> 34:15.119
Again in.

34:15.121 --> 34:16.121
And out.

34:16.688 --> 34:17.757
Good.

34:18.724 --> 34:20.891
I'm afraid there's been
an outbreak of fever

34:20.893 --> 34:22.458
in one of the other halls.

34:22.460 --> 34:24.695
Now, it's nothing
to worry about

34:24.697 --> 34:26.597
but I will be giving
all the students

34:26.599 --> 34:28.731
a series of vaccines,
just to be safe.

34:28.733 --> 34:30.367
Do you understand?

34:30.369 --> 34:31.838
Okay.

34:32.538 --> 34:34.239
Roll up your sleeve,
please.

34:37.775 --> 34:39.578
There we go.

34:40.846 --> 34:42.715
Okay, a little pain.

34:45.451 --> 34:47.186
There we are.

34:47.585 --> 34:50.456
And not a peep
from my brave patient.

34:56.594 --> 34:59.829
Now, Vivien, do you
have any skin problems,

34:59.831 --> 35:01.465
dry spots, pimples?

35:01.467 --> 35:03.599
No.
Never.

35:03.601 --> 35:05.836
That's what I like to hear.

35:05.838 --> 35:09.273
But um,
sometimes there's...

35:09.275 --> 35:10.941
Yes?

35:10.943 --> 35:14.677
Oh, it's nothing.
All the girls get...

35:14.679 --> 35:15.882
Go on.

35:16.614 --> 35:18.882
Uh, sleep scabs?

35:18.884 --> 35:21.286
Sleep scabs.

35:21.619 --> 35:23.355
Can you show me?

35:34.465 --> 35:36.368
One moment.

35:38.737 --> 35:40.472
It's not that bad.

35:41.273 --> 35:42.773
If you just wash it
with soap in the shower,

35:42.775 --> 35:44.711
it normally
just gets better.

35:46.311 --> 35:48.545
When we get adopted our beds
are going to be really soft

35:48.547 --> 35:50.280
and we won't get the
sleep scabs anymore,

35:50.282 --> 35:52.285
that's what
all the girls say.

35:54.920 --> 35:57.354
Well, you were right
about the soap.

35:57.356 --> 36:02.729
Make sure you use a lot
of soap on these sores.

36:03.628 --> 36:05.864
And you tell all
the other girls.

36:06.599 --> 36:09.365
Remember, cleanliness is...?

36:09.367 --> 36:10.766
The second virtue.

36:10.768 --> 36:12.538
Correct.

36:14.340 --> 36:17.807
That should help
speed up the healing

36:17.809 --> 36:19.242
and help with the pain.

36:19.244 --> 36:20.811
Thank you.

36:20.813 --> 36:23.347
Now, Vivien,
we care about you.

36:23.349 --> 36:25.481
The academy is your family.

36:25.483 --> 36:27.450
You can go now.

36:27.452 --> 36:29.922
Grace.
Please enter.

36:39.297 --> 36:40.296
<i>Good morning, young lady.</i>

36:40.298 --> 36:41.398
Hi, Vivien.

36:41.400 --> 36:43.266
Hi, Rita.

36:43.268 --> 36:46.670
- Is that the...
- It's the Vitamin Doctor.

36:46.672 --> 36:49.773
Geez, and I thought this day
couldn't get any better.

36:49.775 --> 36:51.742
And why is today so great?

36:51.744 --> 36:52.976
Hello?

36:52.978 --> 36:55.345
It's day 3.

36:55.347 --> 36:56.813
Yes?

36:56.815 --> 36:59.219
It's Moving Picture night.

37:05.824 --> 37:07.291
<i>Hello.</i>

37:07.293 --> 37:08.561
<i>Hello.</i>

37:10.061 --> 37:11.561
<i>You live here?</i>

37:11.563 --> 37:12.996
<i>Used to.</i>

37:12.998 --> 37:13.963
<i>Who runs this place?</i>

37:13.965 --> 37:15.831
<i>A lady by the name
of Mrs. Burke.</i>

37:15.833 --> 37:17.400
<i>She's not home.</i>

37:17.402 --> 37:18.802
<i>You waiting for her?</i>

37:18.804 --> 37:21.070
<i>Just came back
to get my things.</i>

37:21.072 --> 37:22.905
<i>I've been away
for a while.</i>

37:22.907 --> 37:25.075
<i>I'm waiting for a taxi.</i>

37:25.077 --> 37:27.577
<i>I used to live here
in this house,</i>

37:27.579 --> 37:30.380
<i>seventeen,
eighteen years ago.</i>

37:30.382 --> 37:31.715
<i>Was born here.</i>

37:31.717 --> 37:34.583
<i>Don't kid me.
You're older than that.</i>

37:34.585 --> 37:37.586
<i>Well, I didn't move
right after I was born...</i>

37:42.360 --> 37:44.795
Why the blue pills?

37:44.797 --> 37:47.863
These white ones
make us sleep.

37:47.865 --> 37:49.865
But the blue ones
knocked them right out.

37:49.867 --> 37:51.867
We've never had blue before.

37:51.869 --> 37:55.037
And we've never had
party dresses before.

37:55.039 --> 37:58.311
Because the patrons
never came to see us before.

37:59.878 --> 38:02.849
So the door's never
going to be unlocked again?

38:03.548 --> 38:06.450
I've been waiting
since Level 13.

38:06.452 --> 38:09.485
And they never once
left it unlocked.

38:09.487 --> 38:12.389
What do you do?

38:12.391 --> 38:14.293
During the night?

38:15.027 --> 38:17.360
I fall asleep...

38:17.362 --> 38:19.463
eventually.

38:19.465 --> 38:21.965
A long time after they do.

38:21.967 --> 38:23.833
But then the doors
are locked

38:23.835 --> 38:26.702
and there's nowhere to go,
so...

38:26.704 --> 38:27.903
I listen.

38:27.905 --> 38:29.639
To what?

38:29.641 --> 38:31.541
The other halls.

38:31.543 --> 38:33.376
- There's four halls, right?
- Right.

38:33.378 --> 38:36.545
Rose, Lily, Daisy and Iris.
Everyone knows that...

38:36.547 --> 38:38.617
We all share the same floor.

38:39.518 --> 38:43.552
A hall wakes up,
they go to class.

38:43.554 --> 38:45.421
Do their chores,

38:45.423 --> 38:48.557
vitamin, meal break,

38:48.559 --> 38:51.931
evening cleanse
and sleep.

38:53.164 --> 38:54.967
But then there's a...

38:56.702 --> 38:58.705
a pause.

39:00.438 --> 39:02.639
A Dark Hour

39:02.641 --> 39:04.173
before the next hall
wakes up.

39:04.175 --> 39:07.144
If we get out
during the Dark Hour,

39:07.146 --> 39:09.646
the other girls
won't see us.

39:09.648 --> 39:11.981
Even if we get
into the hall,

39:11.983 --> 39:14.684
there are Big Eyes
everywhere.

39:14.686 --> 39:18.155
I don't think we need to
worry about the Big Eyes.

39:18.157 --> 39:20.757
They bring the guards.

39:20.759 --> 39:23.059
I walked down the hall.

39:23.061 --> 39:25.061
But I was right in front
of the Big Eyes

39:25.063 --> 39:27.164
and nothing happened.

39:27.166 --> 39:28.331
No alarms?

39:28.333 --> 39:32.068
No. I got to the stairs,
but the door wouldn't open.

39:32.070 --> 39:35.007
I think we need one
of those shiny cards.

39:36.775 --> 39:39.208
- We should tell the other girls...
- No!

39:39.210 --> 39:40.209
No way!

39:40.211 --> 39:41.914
They don't know.

39:42.880 --> 39:44.748
They take that pill
every night...

39:44.750 --> 39:46.652
Have you ever been punished?

39:47.952 --> 39:50.623
Have they ever
taken you downstairs?

39:54.693 --> 39:56.963
We'll find another way.

40:07.905 --> 40:09.572
Vivien.

40:09.574 --> 40:11.575
I didn't call for you.

40:11.577 --> 40:13.579
I, no.
I just...

40:14.913 --> 40:17.048
I need to talk to you.

40:18.817 --> 40:20.853
Of course.
Come on in.

40:23.856 --> 40:25.625
Have a seat.

40:34.532 --> 40:36.568
You have something
to tell me?

40:40.606 --> 40:43.539
I like your glasses.

40:43.541 --> 40:46.208
Thank you?

40:46.210 --> 40:49.448
There's a girl in Rose Hall
who has really bad eyesight.

40:51.583 --> 40:53.883
She could use some glasses.

40:55.887 --> 40:57.923
Is this what you
wanted to tell me?

41:01.260 --> 41:05.762
Am I really named
after a famous actress?

41:05.764 --> 41:07.166
Yes.

41:08.900 --> 41:11.803
Vivien Leigh.
A famous beauty.

41:13.070 --> 41:14.639
Do I look like her?

41:15.641 --> 41:17.641
You have her smile.

41:17.643 --> 41:19.309
But then you've never
seen Dark Journey

41:19.311 --> 41:21.778
or Storm in a Teacup.

41:21.780 --> 41:24.146
I wanted to put
Gone With the Wind on your list,

41:24.148 --> 41:28.684
but Miss Brixil
was absolutely opposed.

41:28.686 --> 41:30.320
Moving Picture Night?

41:30.322 --> 41:32.054
Oh, I choose your films.

41:32.056 --> 41:34.324
- That's because of you?
- Uh-huh.

41:34.326 --> 41:36.992
- Oh.
- It's one of the few perks of this position.

41:36.994 --> 41:39.662
Oh, the girls love
Moving Picture Night.

41:39.664 --> 41:42.601
Especially Ava
and Rita and Hedy.

41:43.802 --> 41:45.834
But not you?

41:45.836 --> 41:48.106
No, I love it, too.
It...

41:49.206 --> 41:50.742
Go on.

41:53.644 --> 41:57.146
Well, we see the same,
um, films?

41:57.148 --> 41:58.882
- Uh-hmm.
- Films.

41:58.884 --> 42:00.849
We see them over
and over again.

42:00.851 --> 42:04.086
And most of the time, the
girls know all the words so...

42:04.088 --> 42:07.125
You selfish girl.

42:13.632 --> 42:15.097
You want to know what
Vivien Leigh looks like,

42:15.099 --> 42:16.132
is that it?

42:16.134 --> 42:17.869
Uh, yeah.

42:18.369 --> 42:20.239
I'll see what I can do.

42:21.706 --> 42:23.208
Come on.

42:32.751 --> 42:35.251
Now, let's just keep
this little chat

42:35.253 --> 42:36.952
between the two of us,
shall we?

42:36.954 --> 42:39.891
I don't think Miss Brixil
would approve.

42:40.692 --> 42:42.661
You're so...

42:45.030 --> 42:46.229
nice.

42:46.231 --> 42:49.132
Oh, Vivien,

42:49.134 --> 42:51.967
when a girl
is obedient and sweet,

42:51.969 --> 42:55.104
the world cannot help
but love her.

42:55.106 --> 42:57.106
Just follow the rules,
be patient

42:57.108 --> 42:59.876
and let us
take care of you.

42:59.878 --> 43:01.881
All right?

43:22.333 --> 43:23.735
Veronica?

43:29.106 --> 43:30.375
She needs water.

43:31.009 --> 43:33.142
Grace, can you go
get some water?

43:33.144 --> 43:34.677
Ew.

43:34.679 --> 43:36.880
She's really sick.

43:36.882 --> 43:39.081
It's probably the Fever.

43:39.083 --> 43:40.684
We should call the guards.

43:40.686 --> 43:41.818
She hasn't done
anything wrong.

43:41.820 --> 43:44.887
Well, I don't want to be
infected by a sick girl...

43:44.889 --> 43:48.326
- by any unclean girl...
- Can you shut your gobber, Ava!

43:52.764 --> 43:55.034
Come on. I'm going to
help you get cleaned up.

44:11.148 --> 44:11.880
Are you okay?

44:11.882 --> 44:13.885
Yeah,
I'm sure it's nothing.

44:16.054 --> 44:17.889
Can I see?

44:22.427 --> 44:24.059
I don't have the Fever!

44:24.061 --> 44:25.161
The doctor gave me
the vaccine.

44:25.163 --> 44:26.898
I'm fine.

44:34.338 --> 44:36.241
Let me see your arm.

44:45.382 --> 44:47.318
That looks bad.

44:47.885 --> 44:49.952
It's just a vaccine.

44:49.954 --> 44:52.190
And the pills
are just vitamins.

44:55.927 --> 44:58.097
We should talk
to the other girls.

44:58.963 --> 45:00.996
They would never believe us.

45:00.998 --> 45:03.034
We need a plan.

45:03.902 --> 45:05.271
Um...

45:06.938 --> 45:09.838
or maybe the doctor
could help us.

45:09.840 --> 45:11.775
What?

45:11.777 --> 45:12.809
Why would you trust him?

45:12.811 --> 45:14.747
I... I don't.
I don't.

45:17.114 --> 45:19.250
You just stopped
taking the vitamins...

45:20.284 --> 45:22.855
so you don't know
what's been happening.

45:24.523 --> 45:27.123
There is this guard,

45:27.125 --> 45:30.059
- he limps when he walks...
- Yeah.

45:30.061 --> 45:34.233
Yes, the one with the
metal plate under his shoe?

45:35.400 --> 45:37.336
He comes into our room...

45:39.003 --> 45:41.172
during the Dark Hour.

45:42.807 --> 45:44.744
I don't...

45:45.811 --> 45:47.379
What are you saying?

45:49.213 --> 45:51.150
He comes alone.

45:55.052 --> 45:57.288
And he touches the girls.

45:58.989 --> 46:01.291
He waits until we're asleep

46:01.293 --> 46:03.929
and then he chooses the...

46:17.041 --> 46:20.309
<i>Good grooming starts
with personal care.</i>

46:20.311 --> 46:23.079
<i>This principally means
the care of your hands,</i>

46:23.081 --> 46:26.152
<i>your hair, your teeth
and your skin.</i>

46:27.284 --> 46:30.253
<i>Let's begin with the skin
by taking a look at it</i>

46:30.255 --> 46:32.458
<i>from the doctor's
point of view.</i>

46:33.858 --> 46:37.092
<i>You'll find that skin
is a complex living tissue...</i>

46:42.300 --> 46:44.269
No questions!

46:44.869 --> 46:47.438
Curiosity is the first vice.

46:56.581 --> 47:00.916
<i>♪ Will you hear a Spanish lady</i>

47:00.918 --> 47:05.188
<i>♪ How she woo'd
an Englishman?</i>

47:05.190 --> 47:07.923
<i>♪ Garments gay,
rich as may be</i>

47:07.925 --> 47:10.226
<i>♪ She had on</i>

47:10.228 --> 47:13.898
<i>♪ Comely was her
countenance...</i>

47:15.432 --> 47:16.532
Deep breath.

47:19.137 --> 47:20.068
And again.

47:21.907 --> 47:23.039
Very good.

47:23.041 --> 47:25.110
No sign of any fever,
you're as healthy as a horse.

47:26.344 --> 47:27.943
So how was your
lesson today?

47:27.945 --> 47:31.648
A very fascinating lecture
about hygiene, I hear.

47:31.650 --> 47:33.048
The beautiful lady
in waiting,

47:33.050 --> 47:34.416
that's Vivien Leigh, right?

47:34.418 --> 47:37.153
- You liked it?
- Oh, I loved it.

47:37.155 --> 47:38.554
Yes.
Yeah, very much.

47:38.556 --> 47:41.190
She...
she was so, uh...

47:41.192 --> 47:42.925
strong.

47:42.927 --> 47:44.626
In the way that she walked
and the way that she talked,

47:44.628 --> 47:47.298
I mean, it was just as if
everyone should just...

47:48.500 --> 47:51.103
just get out of her way.

47:51.335 --> 47:53.369
And even when they
were laughing at her

47:53.371 --> 47:56.141
or scowling she
just held her head up.

47:57.074 --> 47:59.377
Like no one
could touch her.

48:01.445 --> 48:04.349
Yes, well, Laurence Olivier
had the better scenes.

48:05.382 --> 48:08.286
I have another vaccination
for you today.

48:09.954 --> 48:11.487
But you said
that I was healthy.

48:11.489 --> 48:13.659
Don't you use
that tone with me.

48:14.659 --> 48:16.059
Sorry.

48:16.061 --> 48:19.195
Sorry, I just, um...

48:19.197 --> 48:21.367
well, the vaccines,

48:22.032 --> 48:24.166
some of the girls
have been getting sick.

48:24.168 --> 48:25.534
If you have any
problems in Rose Hall

48:25.536 --> 48:26.702
you can report that
to Miss Brixil.

48:26.704 --> 48:29.574
Miss Brixil won't help us.
She works with the guards.

48:34.079 --> 48:36.679
Vivien, have you been
taking your vitamins?

48:36.681 --> 48:38.414
Yes.

48:38.416 --> 48:40.650
Of course.

48:40.652 --> 48:43.318
Because you seem upset.
Are you angry?

48:43.320 --> 48:45.220
No.

48:45.222 --> 48:46.621
Anger is a vice.

48:46.623 --> 48:48.458
That's right.

48:48.460 --> 48:51.030
And the vices of the
unclean lead to what?

48:51.762 --> 48:54.299
- Hysteria.
- Correct.

48:55.032 --> 48:59.304
Which is a very serious risk
for young women.

49:03.541 --> 49:07.309
I'm going to give you a
concentrated vitamin injection.

49:07.311 --> 49:08.545
I don't need that.

49:08.547 --> 49:12.180
When a girl behaves
the way you are behaving,

49:12.182 --> 49:14.050
I am required to call
the guards,

49:14.052 --> 49:15.318
do you understand?

49:15.320 --> 49:17.253
To send you down
for punishment.

49:17.255 --> 49:18.724
Is that what you want?

49:20.025 --> 49:21.260
Hmm?

49:22.327 --> 49:24.394
I'm not going to do that

49:24.396 --> 49:26.262
because I think you
deserve a second chance.

49:26.264 --> 49:28.733
Do you deserve
a second chance?

49:30.135 --> 49:32.071
Yes.

49:35.139 --> 49:37.241
What is a girl's
first virtue?

49:42.146 --> 49:44.215
Obedience.

49:50.422 --> 49:51.990
Much better.

50:03.568 --> 50:05.403
This isn't punishment.

50:11.275 --> 50:13.378
I only want to help you.

51:24.615 --> 51:26.284
Viv?

51:29.786 --> 51:33.357
Hmm,
you shouldn't sit with me.

51:34.391 --> 51:37.228
I'm unclean.
I might infect you.

51:38.329 --> 51:41.533
There is nothing
wrong with you.

51:45.536 --> 51:47.872
My head feels heavy.

51:49.541 --> 51:51.309
Your head will clear.

51:51.943 --> 51:54.546
When I first stopped
taking the pills,

51:55.413 --> 51:58.317
it was like my mind was
working for the first time.

51:59.717 --> 52:02.584
The days just all
kind of blur together.

52:02.586 --> 52:03.855
Yeah.

52:04.889 --> 52:08.724
Yeah, that's why I
started keeping a calendar.

52:08.726 --> 52:12.798
I put a line for every day on
the headboard behind my bed.

52:16.934 --> 52:20.471
I've never told
anyone that before.

52:31.548 --> 52:33.418
I have a plan.

52:35.353 --> 52:37.422
What kind of plan?

52:39.724 --> 52:43.562
To get out,
we need a shiny card.

52:44.862 --> 52:47.532
The guards have the cards.

52:48.800 --> 52:50.599
No.

52:50.601 --> 52:53.369
- No. No! No...
- Shh!

52:53.371 --> 52:56.838
The guards are animals.
All they do is hurt us!

52:56.840 --> 52:58.740
- But the...
- Quiet down.

52:58.742 --> 53:01.512
- The guards don't even speak like us.
- Shh!

53:18.929 --> 53:21.264
Are you sure?

53:21.266 --> 53:22.800
What's the problem?

53:24.302 --> 53:26.534
I've never reported
anyone before.

53:26.536 --> 53:29.871
It's our responsibility
to report unclean behavior.

53:29.873 --> 53:32.877
One unclean girl
could infect everyone.

53:34.311 --> 53:35.911
But is she really that bad?

53:35.913 --> 53:37.912
Because, uh, she...

53:37.914 --> 53:40.219
You want a good placement,
don't you?

53:44.289 --> 53:45.887
We follow the rules,

53:45.889 --> 53:47.826
that's what good families want.

53:48.726 --> 53:51.827
If we follow the rules,
we'll get good homes

53:51.829 --> 53:53.632
where we'll be safe.

54:01.773 --> 54:03.505
Hello?

54:03.507 --> 54:06.944
This is student Ava
from Rose Hall on Level 16.

54:07.811 --> 54:10.414
I've witnessed
unclean behavior.

54:13.016 --> 54:15.318
He hasn't done
anything on this level.

54:15.320 --> 54:17.385
But he will do it again.

54:17.387 --> 54:19.521
He won't stop.

54:19.523 --> 54:22.023
He seems strong.

54:22.025 --> 54:23.958
But he comes alone.

54:23.960 --> 54:25.927
Sneaky.

54:25.929 --> 54:28.000
I don't think Brixil
knows he does it.

54:29.367 --> 54:31.436
Well, then we'll
wait for him.

54:32.369 --> 54:33.938
Together.

54:37.775 --> 54:39.708
We could make a rope.

54:39.710 --> 54:41.677
To tie him up.

54:41.679 --> 54:43.912
But first we'll need to...

54:43.914 --> 54:45.050
<i>Assembly.</i>

55:03.101 --> 55:04.970
- Come with me.
- What?

55:07.871 --> 55:09.740
Come on.

55:14.411 --> 55:16.378
I haven't done anything!

55:16.380 --> 55:18.317
You'll speak when
you are spoken to.

55:22.853 --> 55:25.521
Physical punishment
is never my first choice.

55:25.523 --> 55:27.559
Do you understand?

55:30.460 --> 55:32.561
So consider this a test.

55:32.563 --> 55:33.896
Will you cooperate

55:33.898 --> 55:36.635
or do I need to send you
downstairs?

55:40.170 --> 55:42.773
Do I need to call
the guards?

55:58.523 --> 56:01.657
Spend your time here reflecting
on the feminine virtues.

56:01.659 --> 56:03.659
If you show obedience
and sweetness,

56:03.661 --> 56:05.994
I may let you out
in the morning.

56:05.996 --> 56:08.766
Or you can stay here
until graduation.

56:14.905 --> 56:18.376
Don't let this box
be the last thing you see.

57:13.898 --> 57:15.700
You're in a good mood.

57:17.001 --> 57:19.137
And you are not.

57:20.036 --> 57:22.473
I'm worried about Alex.

57:28.679 --> 57:31.914
His uncle is not
an easy man to deal with.

57:31.916 --> 57:33.849
I never wanted to deal
with any of them.

57:33.851 --> 57:36.719
Well, they protect us
and they bring us customers.

57:36.721 --> 57:38.722
They bleed us dry.

57:39.923 --> 57:41.893
They want us to restock.

57:43.226 --> 57:44.862
What?

57:45.862 --> 57:47.729
- Just listen to me...
- Most of the floors are empty.

57:47.731 --> 57:50.132
We wouldn't have to use
children this time.

57:50.134 --> 57:51.733
Not with the
advancements I've made.

57:51.735 --> 57:54.537
We could start
as old as 12,

57:54.539 --> 57:55.905
maybe older.

57:55.907 --> 57:58.773
You said just
3 more years.

57:58.775 --> 58:01.043
They want a greater return
on their investment.

58:01.045 --> 58:03.746
Oh, we have cut corners
year after year.

58:03.748 --> 58:05.014
This place is falling apart

58:05.016 --> 58:06.615
and we are running
ourselves off our feet

58:06.617 --> 58:07.816
trying to keep it going!

58:07.818 --> 58:10.789
What do you want me to do?
These are dangerous people!

58:22.599 --> 58:24.633
We should have
compressed the timeline.

58:24.635 --> 58:26.034
Kept them sedated 24/7.

58:26.036 --> 58:27.903
That was never
financially viable

58:27.905 --> 58:28.637
and you know that.

58:28.639 --> 58:30.039
- Maybe there's a way.
- No.

58:30.041 --> 58:32.041
We'd need ventilators,
nasogastric feeding,

58:32.043 --> 58:33.208
constant medical attention.

58:33.210 --> 58:35.043
We wake them
for five hours a day,

58:35.045 --> 58:37.313
they clean themselves,
feed themselves...

58:37.315 --> 58:39.748
If you hadn't spent so much
time designing classes

58:39.750 --> 58:41.282
and writing up your little
"history lessons."

58:41.284 --> 58:42.184
Well, it's worked,
hasn't it?

58:42.186 --> 58:44.653
By level 10,
they're completely docile.

58:44.655 --> 58:47.659
Oh, like that girl
you doped on level 16?

58:48.925 --> 58:51.529
I had to lock her
in the box today.

58:52.163 --> 58:54.065
That one...

58:55.065 --> 58:57.067
is unusual.

01:00:18.682 --> 01:00:20.382
Don't touch her!

01:00:29.059 --> 01:00:30.929
Oh, Viv!

01:00:32.163 --> 01:00:33.798
No!

01:00:38.402 --> 01:00:39.901
Ah!

01:01:16.239 --> 01:01:17.740
Viv?

01:01:17.742 --> 01:01:19.007
Sophia, you got out?

01:01:19.009 --> 01:01:19.907
I did.

01:01:19.909 --> 01:01:21.275
I got the shiny card.

01:01:23.514 --> 01:01:25.113
Get me out of here.

01:01:25.115 --> 01:01:26.050
Okay.

01:01:29.253 --> 01:01:31.021
Let me out, Sophia.

01:01:32.021 --> 01:01:33.088
The guards will come.

01:01:33.090 --> 01:01:34.822
And I'm covered in blood.

01:01:34.824 --> 01:01:36.124
Open the door, Sophia!

01:01:36.126 --> 01:01:38.226
Don't you leave me,
Sophia!

01:01:38.228 --> 01:01:38.961
You have to trust me.

01:01:38.963 --> 01:01:41.063
Don't leave me!
Not again!

01:01:41.065 --> 01:01:44.932
Don't you turn your back
on me again, Sophia!

01:01:47.905 --> 01:01:49.938
Please...

01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:51.909
please...

01:02:00.083 --> 01:02:02.416
<i>Wake up, Viv.</i>

01:02:02.418 --> 01:02:04.920
<i>I am awake.</i>

01:02:04.922 --> 01:02:07.523
<i>You have to come
find me, Viv.</i>

01:02:07.525 --> 01:02:09.358
<i>I'm awake, really,
I'm awake.</i>

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:11.325
<i>It's too late.
She's coming.</i>

01:02:11.327 --> 01:02:13.427
<i>Who's coming?
Where are you?</i>

01:02:13.429 --> 01:02:15.099
Wake up!

01:02:17.434 --> 01:02:19.367
Ow!

01:02:25.842 --> 01:02:27.144
Come with me.

01:02:31.949 --> 01:02:33.518
Go.

01:02:42.559 --> 01:02:45.864
One of your classmates
has behaved abominably.

01:02:48.032 --> 01:02:51.803
She has taken something valuable
and it must be returned.

01:02:52.369 --> 01:02:54.936
We have searched this girl
and she does not have the item.

01:02:54.938 --> 01:02:57.274
She must have given it
to one of you.

01:02:58.175 --> 01:03:00.943
Any girl who is found
assisting this kind of willful

01:03:00.945 --> 01:03:04.048
disobedient behavior
risks losing her placement.

01:03:06.951 --> 01:03:09.284
But if you turn
yourself in now,

01:03:09.286 --> 01:03:11.586
you can still prove
that you're a clean girl

01:03:11.588 --> 01:03:14.424
who embraces
the feminine virtues.

01:03:16.092 --> 01:03:18.862
This is your last chance
to come forward.

01:03:20.164 --> 01:03:22.834
Come forward
and you will be rewarded.

01:03:24.168 --> 01:03:26.237
- No one...
- Enough!

01:03:31.074 --> 01:03:33.043
William...

01:03:40.416 --> 01:03:44.087
Sophia has betrayed
this school...

01:03:46.090 --> 01:03:49.093
and she has betrayed you.

01:03:50.094 --> 01:03:53.262
Never have I witnessed

01:03:53.264 --> 01:03:57.065
such coarse
and unfeminine behavior,

01:03:57.067 --> 01:03:59.367
such ingratitude.

01:03:59.369 --> 01:04:02.670
We gave you a full life
and this is how you repay us?!

01:04:02.672 --> 01:04:04.908
We treated you like family!

01:04:08.512 --> 01:04:12.217
Well, perhaps the time
for that is over.

01:04:17.221 --> 01:04:18.920
Her.

01:04:18.922 --> 01:04:20.655
I haven't done anything.
No...

01:04:20.657 --> 01:04:23.291
Today, this girl
will be punished.

01:04:23.293 --> 01:04:25.494
- Please, no, no!
- Tomorrow, another,

01:04:25.496 --> 01:04:27.229
the next day,
another

01:04:27.231 --> 01:04:29.932
and another and another
and another

01:04:29.934 --> 01:04:33.605
until the item you have
taken is returned!

01:04:38.641 --> 01:04:42.614
I hope for your sake I've
made myself perfectly clear.

01:05:20.684 --> 01:05:23.021
Not so fast, girls!

01:05:24.621 --> 01:05:26.423
Follow me.

01:05:34.297 --> 01:05:37.532
We're going to be extra careful
about your health from now on.

01:05:37.534 --> 01:05:39.304
Open your mouth.

01:05:44.541 --> 01:05:46.311
Next.

01:05:52.016 --> 01:05:54.184
Take the pill.

01:06:02.659 --> 01:06:04.528
Lift your tongue.

01:06:07.398 --> 01:06:09.300
Do it.

01:06:13.403 --> 01:06:15.604
Don't look at me like that.

01:06:15.606 --> 01:06:18.309
Tomorrow you'll join
your new family.

01:06:28.318 --> 01:06:30.588
Stay awake.

01:06:33.056 --> 01:06:36.259
Stay awake.

01:07:07.391 --> 01:07:08.793
Where is it?

01:07:13.563 --> 01:07:15.130
Where is it?

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.400
Where's the card?

01:07:35.219 --> 01:07:37.221
Where's the pin?

01:07:37.688 --> 01:07:40.391
Oh, please.
Oh, please...

01:07:58.675 --> 01:08:01.512
Thank you, Vee.

01:08:06.617 --> 01:08:08.152
William?

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:55.166
No.

01:08:55.564 --> 01:08:56.964
No. No!

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:59.402
No. No. No. No.

01:08:59.868 --> 01:09:01.372
No!

01:09:06.341 --> 01:09:08.845
No!

01:09:09.246 --> 01:09:10.846
Please!

01:11:22.878 --> 01:11:24.849
Hello?

01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:58.815
You might as well come in.

01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:07.958
Sit down.

01:12:13.162 --> 01:12:17.067
It won't hurt to sit down.
You can barely stand.

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:20.371
Because you drugged me.

01:12:22.972 --> 01:12:24.839
He said you were different.

01:12:24.841 --> 01:12:26.711
Where is Sophia?

01:12:28.878 --> 01:12:30.711
You two are friends?

01:12:30.713 --> 01:12:32.580
Tell me where she is!

01:12:32.582 --> 01:12:34.581
We change your hall
assignments on each level

01:12:34.583 --> 01:12:35.817
to prevent that
kind of bonding.

01:12:35.819 --> 01:12:38.152
Tell me where she is!

01:12:38.154 --> 01:12:40.123
She's downstairs.
She's fine.

01:12:42.792 --> 01:12:47.027
I don't want to hurt you,
any of you.

01:12:47.029 --> 01:12:50.768
I'm going to leave
this place tonight...

01:12:54.203 --> 01:12:56.639
or tomorrow.

01:13:00.743 --> 01:13:03.844
First, I need to give you
this vitamin.

01:13:03.846 --> 01:13:07.617
And then I will take you
downstairs to see your friend.

01:13:09.653 --> 01:13:11.055
Or not.

01:13:19.529 --> 01:13:21.098
My face...

01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:23.598
Agh!

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:25.936
No! Agh!

01:13:30.105 --> 01:13:31.775
You won't get out.

01:13:32.676 --> 01:13:34.541
Ah...

01:13:34.543 --> 01:13:38.679
Patience is a virtue.

01:16:37.159 --> 01:16:39.027
- Vee.
- No! No!

01:16:39.029 --> 01:16:41.795
It's okay. It's okay.
It's just me.

01:16:41.797 --> 01:16:43.300
It's okay.

01:16:50.439 --> 01:16:53.007
You came after me.

01:16:53.009 --> 01:16:55.212
Of course I did.

01:16:56.279 --> 01:16:58.382
You're my friend.

01:17:01.216 --> 01:17:03.217
Can you untie me?

01:17:03.219 --> 01:17:05.722
Oh, sorry.

01:17:09.359 --> 01:17:11.829
No, I think we're
going to have to cut it.

01:17:28.344 --> 01:17:29.811
Here.

01:17:34.417 --> 01:17:36.387
Okay, turn around.

01:17:42.192 --> 01:17:44.060
Done.

01:17:44.993 --> 01:17:47.264
What is this place?

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:20.794
Ruh...

01:18:20.796 --> 01:18:24.331
Ruh-eat...

01:18:24.333 --> 01:18:27.970
I-tuh...

01:18:31.274 --> 01:18:32.943
Rita?

01:18:34.778 --> 01:18:38.312
The Doctor took her...
to be punished.

01:18:38.314 --> 01:18:40.447
He said that...

01:18:40.449 --> 01:18:42.920
He said...

01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:24.527
They killed her!

01:19:25.094 --> 01:19:26.797
We should leave...

01:19:27.262 --> 01:19:28.865
now.

01:19:30.466 --> 01:19:32.465
They cut off her face.

01:19:32.467 --> 01:19:34.268
Why would they do that?

01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:36.236
I don't know
and I don't care.

01:19:36.238 --> 01:19:38.407
I just want to get
out of here.

01:19:39.007 --> 01:19:40.778
If we leave,

01:19:42.045 --> 01:19:43.410
they'll kill the other girls.

01:19:43.412 --> 01:19:44.845
We can't do anything.

01:19:44.847 --> 01:19:46.984
The alarm could go off
at any time.

01:19:49.618 --> 01:19:51.552
What about Olivia?

01:19:51.554 --> 01:19:54.455
And Clara?
And Ava?

01:19:54.457 --> 01:19:57.525
Ava wouldn't risk her neck
for either of us.

01:19:57.527 --> 01:20:00.264
Do you want all of them
to end up like...

01:20:02.064 --> 01:20:03.563
like that?

01:20:03.565 --> 01:20:05.566
What can we do?

01:20:05.568 --> 01:20:07.538
There are two of us.

01:20:16.546 --> 01:20:19.016
I have to try to help them.

01:20:20.917 --> 01:20:23.220
And I have to leave.

01:20:23.987 --> 01:20:24.986
This is it.

01:20:24.988 --> 01:20:26.419
Will the air be safe?

01:20:26.421 --> 01:20:28.925
I'll take my chances.

01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:36.597
Come with me.

01:20:36.599 --> 01:20:38.031
We'll get out.
We'll get help...

01:20:38.033 --> 01:20:40.166
No one's going to help us.

01:20:40.168 --> 01:20:41.936
No one is going to save us.

01:20:41.938 --> 01:20:44.371
You're half-blind.

01:20:44.373 --> 01:20:46.443
So come with me.

01:20:49.311 --> 01:20:51.544
No.
I'm sorry.

01:20:51.546 --> 01:20:53.349
Here.

01:20:55.051 --> 01:20:57.384
Wait for me...

01:20:57.386 --> 01:21:01.090
as long as two meal breaks?

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:07.530
One meal break?

01:21:12.568 --> 01:21:16.469
I'll wait,
but you're making a mistake.

01:21:16.471 --> 01:21:20.074
I turned my back
on a friend before.

01:21:20.076 --> 01:21:22.710
Because this place
taught me,

01:21:22.712 --> 01:21:25.949
trained me,
to be afraid.

01:21:30.619 --> 01:21:33.422
But I am not afraid anymore.

01:21:41.229 --> 01:21:42.696
<i>Good morning, girls.</i>

01:21:42.698 --> 01:21:45.333
<i>We hope you had
a restful night.</i>

01:21:45.335 --> 01:21:47.101
<i>As we do every morning,</i>

01:21:47.103 --> 01:21:50.705
<i>let us review the Seven Virtues
and the Seven Vices.</i>

01:21:50.707 --> 01:21:55.308
<i>The Seven Virtues are
obedience, cleanliness,</i>

01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:57.711
<i>patience, humility,</i>

01:21:57.713 --> 01:22:02.083
<i>purity, sweetness
and modesty.</i>

01:22:02.085 --> 01:22:06.253
<i>The Seven Vices are
curiosity, anger,</i>

01:22:06.255 --> 01:22:09.225
<i>sentimentality,
slovenliness...</i>

01:22:21.337 --> 01:22:25.638
<i>A Vestalis girl is sensible,
not sentimental.</i>

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:28.041
<i>Sentimentality
is the third vice.</i>

01:22:28.043 --> 01:22:31.245
Sentimentality
is the third vice.

01:22:31.247 --> 01:22:32.679
Well done!

01:22:32.681 --> 01:22:35.116
Excellent, um,
pronunciation.

01:22:35.118 --> 01:22:36.683
<i>Now let us contemplate
the fourth vice.</i>

01:22:36.685 --> 01:22:38.052
Let's not.

01:22:38.054 --> 01:22:40.754
<i>Ears open, minds open.</i>

01:22:40.756 --> 01:22:44.293
<i>As before, you will repeat
the final sentence in unison...</i>

01:22:46.796 --> 01:22:50.500
Um...
Miss Brixil sent me.

01:22:53.168 --> 01:22:54.335
You're from Iris Hall,
right?

01:22:54.337 --> 01:22:56.169
- No. Lily Hall...
- Oh, right. Lily Hall.

01:22:56.171 --> 01:22:57.237
That's what I meant.

01:22:57.239 --> 01:22:58.571
Your assignment,
from Miss Brixil,

01:22:58.573 --> 01:23:00.407
is to wake up all the girls
on this level.

01:23:00.409 --> 01:23:02.175
Why are you wearing
your night gown?

01:23:02.177 --> 01:23:03.343
Uh...

01:23:03.345 --> 01:23:05.178
we were both on
Level 13 together, right?

01:23:05.180 --> 01:23:06.714
- And your name is...?
- May.

01:23:06.716 --> 01:23:07.781
May, right.

01:23:07.783 --> 01:23:10.420
Well, May,
you are now top girl.

01:25:08.404 --> 01:25:09.903
<i>At the Vestalis Clinic,</i>

01:25:09.905 --> 01:25:13.773

01:25:47.577 --> 01:25:49.943
<i>Ensuring that our
donor material</i>

01:25:49.945 --> 01:25:52.646
<i>will match your personal DNA,</i>

01:25:52.648 --> 01:25:54.915
<i>completely eliminating
the need for unpleasant...</i>

01:25:54.917 --> 01:25:56.753
No!

01:26:11.967 --> 01:26:13.034
Where is Miss Brixil?

01:26:13.036 --> 01:26:16.736
I promise, I'll explain
but we have to hurry.

01:26:16.738 --> 01:26:17.870
We have to go.

01:26:17.872 --> 01:26:19.639
Is that...
is that blood?

01:26:19.641 --> 01:26:22.343
Just listen to me,
okay, and...

01:26:22.345 --> 01:26:23.410
and trust me that...

01:26:23.412 --> 01:26:25.345
Doctor Miro said that you
betrayed our school.

01:26:25.347 --> 01:26:27.449
This is not a school!

01:26:28.684 --> 01:26:29.782
It's a prison.

01:26:29.784 --> 01:26:31.418
We should call the guards.

01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:33.887
That would be a bad idea.

01:26:36.024 --> 01:26:37.825
- Miss Brixil!
- Miss Brixil?

01:26:39.595 --> 01:26:40.660
Quiet down.

01:26:40.662 --> 01:26:42.831
Quiet...
Quiet down!

01:26:45.967 --> 01:26:49.405
This is not...
a school.

01:26:50.405 --> 01:26:53.339
This isn't a prison.
No.

01:26:53.341 --> 01:26:55.377
This is a farm.

01:26:57.046 --> 01:26:59.847
And they raise us here
like sheep.

01:26:59.849 --> 01:27:02.583
- Miss Brixil...
- The sponsors do not want to adopt us.

01:27:02.585 --> 01:27:04.317
All they care about
is our skin.

01:27:04.319 --> 01:27:05.686
And they will
take you downstairs

01:27:05.688 --> 01:27:07.787
and skin you like an animal.

01:27:07.789 --> 01:27:10.426
- You're lying.
- Rita is dead!

01:27:12.828 --> 01:27:15.028
We found her body.

01:27:15.030 --> 01:27:17.430
They took her face.

01:27:17.432 --> 01:27:18.799
They killed her?

01:27:18.801 --> 01:27:20.366
Are they...
are they going to kill us?

01:27:20.368 --> 01:27:21.735
No!

01:27:21.737 --> 01:27:24.838
The school saved us from
the poisonous air outside!

01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:28.244
Ava, for once
in your life just think!

01:27:29.645 --> 01:27:31.481
Tell them!

01:27:34.082 --> 01:27:36.518
I can't help you.

01:27:38.087 --> 01:27:40.787
Tell them about
the dead girls.

01:27:40.789 --> 01:27:43.022
You killed Rita!

01:27:43.024 --> 01:27:45.494
I've never killed anyone.

01:27:47.796 --> 01:27:52.333
Maybe you didn't
carve her up yourself...

01:27:52.335 --> 01:27:54.770
but you killed her.

01:27:56.706 --> 01:27:59.275
You killed her.

01:28:01.377 --> 01:28:04.681
How many girls
have died in this place?

01:28:07.949 --> 01:28:10.384
There's nothing I can do.

01:28:10.386 --> 01:28:12.422
You can help us.

01:28:21.730 --> 01:28:23.932
It's too late.

01:28:27.936 --> 01:28:29.639
Her face.

01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:33.677
Look at her face.

01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:46.089
You're one of them.

01:28:47.722 --> 01:28:49.990
A Sponsor.

01:28:49.992 --> 01:28:52.028
I just wanted to help him.

01:28:52.828 --> 01:28:56.099
He's a brilliant man,
a genius.

01:28:59.635 --> 01:29:01.771
I didn't know.

01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:04.373
I didn't know.

01:29:06.007 --> 01:29:08.877
Whose face
are you wearing?

01:29:26.729 --> 01:29:28.762
Spend your time
in here reflecting

01:29:28.764 --> 01:29:31.634
on the Feminine Virtues.

01:29:40.975 --> 01:29:42.476
Up here!

01:29:42.478 --> 01:29:43.980
Shh!

01:29:47.015 --> 01:29:49.215
Sophia, you take
the girls outside.

01:29:49.217 --> 01:29:50.918
I will take the passcard
and wake up the girls

01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:52.885
on the lower level.

01:29:54.823 --> 01:29:56.492
Ava!

01:29:57.059 --> 01:29:59.462
Go! Go!
Hurry!

01:30:22.217 --> 01:30:24.052
- Viv!
- No!

01:30:25.186 --> 01:30:27.120
Leave her alone!

01:30:28.791 --> 01:30:30.092
Go!

01:31:00.154 --> 01:31:01.824
You're hurt.

01:31:02.824 --> 01:31:04.290
I'm fine.

01:31:04.292 --> 01:31:06.128
- Let's go.
- Okay.

01:31:09.265 --> 01:31:10.834
Come on.

01:31:12.868 --> 01:31:15.238
- We can breathe the air.
- Keep moving.

01:31:25.014 --> 01:31:26.216
Oh no!

01:31:26.948 --> 01:31:28.214
Run!

01:31:28.216 --> 01:31:29.152
Go!

01:31:38.027 --> 01:31:39.596
I'm sorry.

01:31:51.707 --> 01:31:53.142
Quick. Quick.

01:32:13.796 --> 01:32:15.999
- Doctor.
- How many?

01:32:17.298 --> 01:32:19.935
<i>Girls, can you hear me?</i>

01:32:30.311 --> 01:32:31.881
Vivien.

01:32:34.783 --> 01:32:36.316
You need to get
out of there right now

01:32:36.318 --> 01:32:37.750
and let me take you
back to the school.

01:32:37.752 --> 01:32:40.019
We know what you've done.

01:32:40.021 --> 01:32:41.254
Oh, my dear,
you're confused.

01:32:41.256 --> 01:32:43.793
We found Rita!

01:32:50.798 --> 01:32:52.264
I just want to help you.

01:32:52.266 --> 01:32:53.232
No, you don't.

01:32:53.234 --> 01:32:55.201
- You want to kill us!
- No.

01:32:55.203 --> 01:32:57.204
No, I saved you...

01:32:57.206 --> 01:33:00.272
I saved you from...
from poverty.

01:33:00.274 --> 01:33:02.275
And...
and parents who were

01:33:02.277 --> 01:33:05.211
more than happy
to sell you.

01:33:05.213 --> 01:33:06.946
I built a home for you.

01:33:06.948 --> 01:33:09.750
You locked us up.
You drugged us.

01:33:09.752 --> 01:33:12.085
You had no future,
Vivien.

01:33:12.087 --> 01:33:15.656
I... I gave you food
and safety and...

01:33:15.658 --> 01:33:17.360
Ignorance!

01:33:21.863 --> 01:33:23.699
Your friend is hurt.

01:33:24.432 --> 01:33:25.866
It's too late to save her,

01:33:25.868 --> 01:33:28.237
but it's not too late
for you, Vivien.

01:33:29.704 --> 01:33:32.207
I can't save the other girls,
but I could save you.

01:33:33.242 --> 01:33:36.410
I could help you
and you could help me.

01:33:36.412 --> 01:33:38.711
How could I help you?

01:33:38.713 --> 01:33:39.979
Open the door

01:33:39.981 --> 01:33:42.848
and help me find
all the other lost girls.

01:33:42.850 --> 01:33:44.987
Help me get them
back to the school.

01:33:46.255 --> 01:33:47.923
Just open the door.

01:33:49.891 --> 01:33:52.159
You don't have to share the
same fate as this poor girl.

01:33:52.161 --> 01:33:53.863
You're not like her.

01:33:54.997 --> 01:33:58.098
You're not like
the other girls.

01:33:58.100 --> 01:33:59.736
You're wrong.

01:34:01.336 --> 01:34:03.139
I am.

01:34:05.807 --> 01:34:10.145
I am just like
the other girls.

01:34:17.219 --> 01:34:20.320
Could we just find
a crowbar or something?

01:34:20.322 --> 01:34:21.787
That's a solid
security door.

01:34:21.789 --> 01:34:23.423
Just get something!

01:34:23.425 --> 01:34:25.858
So how much am I worth?

01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:27.259
Hmm?

01:34:27.261 --> 01:34:29.463
How much is this worth?

01:34:29.465 --> 01:34:33.433
I've invested 16 years
of my life for that face.

01:34:33.435 --> 01:34:35.672
I'm not leaving without it.

01:34:46.914 --> 01:34:48.115
Vivien.

01:34:48.117 --> 01:34:49.516
Vivien, wait.
No.

01:34:49.518 --> 01:34:51.884
Don't... Stop!
Stop! No!

01:34:51.886 --> 01:34:54.153
Stop! No!

01:34:54.155 --> 01:34:56.225
Stop! Stop!

01:35:26.354 --> 01:35:28.056
He wants to see you.

01:35:28.823 --> 01:35:32.291
No, we... we can, uh,
salvage this situation.

01:35:32.293 --> 01:35:34.059
Get moving.

01:35:34.061 --> 01:35:35.094
No, no, I can...
I can fix this.

01:35:35.096 --> 01:35:37.129
You just have your people
deal with the police

01:35:37.131 --> 01:35:38.865
- and I'll gather...
- He doesn't wait.

01:35:38.867 --> 01:35:41.070
Not for anyone,
not for you.

01:35:41.936 --> 01:35:43.472
Okay, okay.

01:35:43.971 --> 01:35:45.340
Okay.

01:36:24.979 --> 01:36:27.280
We have
two more survivors here.

01:36:27.282 --> 01:36:29.049
Send the paramedics.

01:36:29.051 --> 01:36:30.887
Quickly.

01:36:31.987 --> 01:36:34.422
My friend is hurt.

01:36:35.056 --> 01:36:37.025
What happened to you?
