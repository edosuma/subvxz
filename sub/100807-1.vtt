WEBVTT

00:23.516 --> 00:25.852
Okay this,
is volume two.

00:28.788 --> 00:29.989
The handbook, my handbook.

00:30.023 --> 00:31.924
Okay we'll smudge
it, we'll smudge it.

00:34.326 --> 00:35.427
Enceladism.

00:35.460 --> 00:36.261
Is truth.

00:38.263 --> 00:41.668
Adam getting cancer
and you getting sober,

00:41.701 --> 00:42.869
the timing is divine.

00:42.902 --> 00:45.071
There is nothing accidental!

00:46.606 --> 00:49.341
Spirit shows us when.

00:50.510 --> 00:52.145
It is time to take things

00:52.177 --> 00:53.046
to the next level.

00:55.313 --> 00:57.784
Awaken to your higher purpose.

00:59.217 --> 01:00.853
Everything will be alright.

02:20.465 --> 02:21.834
Dyatt-chenn

02:27.707 --> 02:30.643
Get out of the road you
little purple bicycle bitch!

02:44.590 --> 02:48.861
♪ You're dead ♪

02:48.895 --> 02:53.298
♪ You're dead ♪

02:53.331 --> 02:57.603
♪ You're so still I
think you're dead ♪

02:57.637 --> 02:59.605
♪ I'm scared ♪

02:59.639 --> 03:02.742
♪ Too check in
case you're dead ♪

03:02.775 --> 03:04.342
Hey what's the
soup of the day?

03:04.376 --> 03:05.443
Nat?

03:05.477 --> 03:07.445
Dyatt Chennn!

03:07.479 --> 03:08.313
Nat!

03:09.715 --> 03:10.750
Oh sh-I'm sorry.

03:10.783 --> 03:11.984
Oh so sorry.

03:12.018 --> 03:12.819
Okay.

03:12.852 --> 03:13.719
Okay.

03:13.753 --> 03:14.654
All right.

03:14.687 --> 03:16.388
Flourish crew, time to flourish.

03:16.421 --> 03:18.456
Stick 'em up, stitches
later, okay up now.

03:18.490 --> 03:23.495
En-cel-a-dism.

03:27.332 --> 03:28.835
Ugh, I hate hospitals.

03:29.802 --> 03:34.540
Oh, here, sorry.

03:34.574 --> 03:35.407
I'm sorry.

03:36.909 --> 03:40.680
Well you're never gonna
forget 30 days sober.

03:42.114 --> 03:43.716
I don't care about that.

03:43.749 --> 03:45.184
You should.

03:45.218 --> 03:47.887
I've been in a lot of
kitchens, 30's tough.

03:47.920 --> 03:49.856
You gotta own it.

03:49.889 --> 03:52.692
Adam's supposed to
get his results today.

03:53.559 --> 03:55.360
How's your meditation coming?

03:57.063 --> 03:58.898
Did you get a chance
to get the text?

04:00.633 --> 04:01.466
Dude.

04:05.671 --> 04:08.674
I bet that blast of delicious
energy felt good though huh?

04:14.013 --> 04:14.847
Here.

04:16.015 --> 04:18.584
It's better to receive
it as a gift anyway.

04:18.618 --> 04:20.653
So now that's your
autographed copy.

04:22.053 --> 04:24.724
He's Irish but he
lives north of KC now.

04:24.757 --> 04:26.125
I met him at Prosperos.

04:26.993 --> 04:30.162
He channeled the whole text.

04:31.097 --> 04:31.998
He's a genius.

04:36.434 --> 04:38.004
We've been emailing each other.

04:39.437 --> 04:44.442
I told him about you because
there's some stuff in here

04:45.578 --> 04:47.580
about the pain body
and second sight

04:47.613 --> 04:49.849
and sounds like your glitches.

04:53.719 --> 04:55.288
Book changed my life, no doubt.

05:02.929 --> 05:04.563
Were you holding that
'til you started the car?

05:05.430 --> 05:06.265
What?

05:07.533 --> 05:09.802
Soup of the day was
definitely mushroom.

05:18.377 --> 05:19.211
Please.

05:25.718 --> 05:27.019
Hey, Adam, come on back.

05:44.837 --> 05:46.072
Look at Sadie.

05:48.007 --> 05:49.175
She looks
like her auntie.

05:49.208 --> 05:50.042
Right?

05:51.744 --> 05:52.979
Adam still hasn't texted.

05:55.247 --> 05:57.350
Now his appointment was at 11.

05:57.383 --> 05:58.851
He will.

05:58.884 --> 06:00.386
Don't worry.

06:00.419 --> 06:02.188
Aleah, did
you guys still want to...

06:02.221 --> 06:03.055
Yeah.

06:08.861 --> 06:10.463
- Hi, I'm Nat.
- Hi, Nat.

06:11.397 --> 06:12.497
I'm an alcoholic.

06:15.134 --> 06:17.103
I'd like to thank my
best friend, Aleah,

06:17.136 --> 06:18.170
for being my sponsor.

06:20.039 --> 06:23.609
She's generous and more
patient than I deserve.

06:25.845 --> 06:26.946
I can't remember
the last time that

06:26.979 --> 06:28.047
I was 30 days without drinking.

06:32.852 --> 06:36.122
I get this recurring
vision of a bloody face.

06:38.858 --> 06:40.493
I've had 'em all my
life but when I drink

06:40.526 --> 06:41.994
it doesn't happen as much so.

06:46.565 --> 06:47.767
I don't know if you're supposed

06:47.800 --> 06:49.835
to get crazy dreams
when you stop drinking

06:51.437 --> 06:53.672
but I had a dream
last night I was in

06:53.706 --> 06:58.077
my high school bathroom and
the guy next to me was peeing.

06:58.110 --> 06:59.378
But instead of a regular dick,

06:59.412 --> 07:00.279
he had like a...

07:02.548 --> 07:04.183
Flesh... disc.

07:05.451 --> 07:06.652
like a garbage can lid

07:06.685 --> 07:08.287
and he asked me to
help him hold it up

07:09.755 --> 07:10.623
so he could pee.

07:12.324 --> 07:14.060
I mean pee was leaking
from it like a pizza cr...

07:23.269 --> 07:24.504
Thanks Nat.

08:33.405 --> 08:34.240
Hey.

08:37.376 --> 08:38.611
I got you a fish.

08:43.616 --> 08:45.251
Her name is Silver.

08:59.331 --> 09:00.432
I'm scared.

10:17.843 --> 10:20.179
I can't even give
me four months without drama.

10:21.947 --> 10:24.016
I told you I was trouble.

10:25.184 --> 10:28.354
No you said "troubled"
so I was like hmmmm...

10:30.990 --> 10:34.661
Chemo, that
sounds gross, chemo.

10:34.694 --> 10:36.795
You don't have to call
it that. Call it therapy.

10:40.899 --> 10:44.937
I was angry at you today.

10:44.970 --> 10:47.806
I wouldn't have gone to the
doctor if you didn't make me.

10:48.774 --> 10:49.775
It wasn't a hickey.

10:55.682 --> 10:56.616
I'm proud of you.

10:58.551 --> 10:59.519
Thank you.

11:04.390 --> 11:06.158
I was Jesse's
age when dad died.

11:07.627 --> 11:09.696
I remember hugging my mom
on my bed when she cried.

11:11.397 --> 11:13.533
She doesn't deserve this again.

11:13.566 --> 11:15.801
No one gets cancer on purpose.

11:15.834 --> 11:16.935
It doesn't matter.

11:16.969 --> 11:17.870
They're your family.

11:17.903 --> 11:18.904
They love you no matter what.

11:21.708 --> 11:24.143
I'm not scared of dying,
I just don't want to.

11:24.176 --> 11:25.978
You are not going to die.

11:36.690 --> 11:38.023
I love you, Nat.

15:09.536 --> 15:10.904
Wash your hands.

15:13.071 --> 15:15.542
What's for dinner?

15:23.081 --> 15:23.983
You were dreaming.

15:26.084 --> 15:27.319
What did you dream about?

15:28.186 --> 15:30.155
Hell.

15:31.356 --> 15:34.561
Mom said cancer's
a demon from hell.

15:34.594 --> 15:35.795
There's no such place.

15:36.729 --> 15:37.597
Yeah, there is.

15:39.097 --> 15:40.633
Honey, hell is just
the absence of love

15:40.667 --> 15:42.635
and you never have
to worry about that.

15:45.038 --> 15:47.472
I can feel my soul
trying to leave my body.

15:49.576 --> 15:50.677
Your body's healing.

15:53.046 --> 15:54.246
Do a meditation with me.

15:56.448 --> 15:58.083
Breathe with me.

16:06.559 --> 16:09.996
Thank you, Lord, for the
food you have set before us

16:10.029 --> 16:12.364
and thank you for
this beautiful day.

16:12.397 --> 16:14.701
And may we continue to be worthy

16:14.734 --> 16:16.970
of your wondrous blessings.

16:28.413 --> 16:29.716
I think he'll rest well.

16:33.987 --> 16:35.088
See you tomorrow Anna.

16:39.191 --> 16:40.026
Hey.

16:44.797 --> 16:45.632
He needs rest.

16:47.567 --> 16:48.400
He's resting.

16:54.007 --> 16:55.975
He needs more rest.

16:57.777 --> 16:59.779
So he'll rest and
I see him tomorrow.

17:04.817 --> 17:07.587
No, you won't.

17:07.619 --> 17:08.453
What?

17:09.856 --> 17:11.590
You were in there
everyday for a month.

17:11.624 --> 17:14.661
It's absurd, you
don't live here.

17:14.694 --> 17:15.627
I never said tha-

17:15.662 --> 17:18.363
- This is a Christian household.

17:19.196 --> 17:20.365
He wants me her...

17:20.398 --> 17:23.102
I don't want you in my house.

17:24.103 --> 17:25.038
What the fu...

17:25.070 --> 17:27.707
Don't, do not.

17:27.740 --> 17:30.275
He is sick, not diseased.

17:31.176 --> 17:33.713
I don't want you seeing my son.

17:33.746 --> 17:35.014
Do you understand me?

17:35.982 --> 17:37.850
I don't want you in my house.

17:38.718 --> 17:41.219
This is my house.

17:42.655 --> 17:44.991
I ran
over my little girl's dog

17:45.024 --> 17:46.159
and I didn't stop.

17:48.027 --> 17:51.229
I didn't stop but I looked

17:51.263 --> 17:53.398
in that rearview mirror.

17:53.432 --> 17:54.834
I had a little buzz too.

17:54.867 --> 17:58.470
And I saw that little
toe-headed six-year-old kid

18:00.740 --> 18:03.743
gettin' smaller and
smaller and smaller

18:03.776 --> 18:05.343
in my rearview mirror.

18:07.613 --> 18:09.281
I never went back.

18:09.314 --> 18:12.451
I never, ever went back.

18:15.287 --> 18:18.624
And I sent her a card
on her graduation.

18:20.693 --> 18:21.694
Never heard a thing.

18:22.862 --> 18:26.364
I tried to call her
when she got married.

18:26.398 --> 18:27.499
Wouldn't take my call.

18:29.102 --> 18:30.335
But her mom called me and said,

18:30.368 --> 18:31.637
"You're an old drunk.

18:31.671 --> 18:34.339
Don't ever reach
out to her again.

18:34.372 --> 18:37.275
You scarred her
and the rest of us

18:37.309 --> 18:39.812
because all you wanted
to do is drink."

18:39.846 --> 18:42.215
And that's one thing
I did very well.

18:42.247 --> 18:43.950
I told you, I hadn't
hit rock bottom

18:43.983 --> 18:45.383
and I still haven't
hit rock bottom

18:45.417 --> 18:47.153
because I'm runnin' from it.

18:47.186 --> 18:48.020
Aleah!

18:49.522 --> 18:53.226
Aleah, excuse me, I'm Jimmy.

18:53.258 --> 18:54.227
Hi, Jimmy.

18:54.259 --> 18:55.628
I'm new.

18:55.661 --> 18:56.495
Right on.

18:57.730 --> 18:58.998
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah.

18:59.031 --> 19:00.666
I'm Jimmy.

19:00.700 --> 19:03.803
Ow, my hand!

19:03.836 --> 19:04.637
Are you okay?

19:04.670 --> 19:05.805
Are you on Facebook?

19:05.838 --> 19:08.007
Uh, what?

19:08.040 --> 19:11.110
- You have bubba skin.
- Thanks.

19:11.144 --> 19:13.713
This was my first meeting.

19:13.746 --> 19:14.881
Awesome.

19:14.914 --> 19:15.748
Shut up.

19:17.250 --> 19:18.551
Do you hear that?

19:21.554 --> 19:23.589
You should really
change that tampon.

19:27.960 --> 19:31.296
Excuse me, hey, hey,
that is not right!

19:32.397 --> 19:34.600
No, that kid was just...

19:36.636 --> 19:37.469
That.

19:45.111 --> 19:46.546
Yo, I go by High Westhus.

19:46.579 --> 19:49.215
Give it up for my man, DJ John,
on the ones and twos, y'all.

19:51.483 --> 19:52.317
Hey girl!

19:52.350 --> 19:53.719
Five right?

19:53.753 --> 19:54.821
You're good.

19:54.854 --> 19:56.022
Oh thanks is Nat here?

19:56.055 --> 19:57.256
- I think I saw him?
- Where?

19:57.290 --> 19:58.825
I don't know, I
think I saw him,

19:58.858 --> 20:00.458
I think he's drunk.

20:22.782 --> 20:24.250
Hey, it's me.

20:24.283 --> 20:27.419
I uh, went to the meeting
today, you didn't show.

20:28.554 --> 20:30.890
This little asshole
got in my face.

20:30.923 --> 20:35.294
I hope everything's okay,
call me. I'm at Minibar.

20:38.363 --> 20:39.431
Are you okay?

20:39.464 --> 20:41.300
I heard you were here.

20:41.334 --> 20:42.501
Call me back.

20:42.535 --> 20:43.336
Love you.

21:20.039 --> 21:20.873
Nat!

21:37.556 --> 21:38.391
Nat?

21:45.164 --> 21:45.965
Oh Shit!

21:45.998 --> 21:46.866
Aleah!

21:46.899 --> 21:48.701
You listen!

21:48.734 --> 21:52.505
Stay away from Nat!

21:53.471 --> 21:55.041
Stay away from Nat!

22:00.579 --> 22:02.581
The wretch is ours.

22:04.684 --> 22:06.619
But you're mine.

22:06.652 --> 22:10.122
Stay away from Nat or
I'll kiss your niece.

22:13.893 --> 22:14.727
Kisses.

22:44.790 --> 22:46.292
This
is your matcha bowl

22:46.325 --> 22:47.526
kettle is on the stove.

22:48.493 --> 22:49.895
Your pissy jeans
are in the wash.

22:49.929 --> 22:51.764
Why don't you ease into mine.

22:51.797 --> 22:53.599
Jean, duh.

23:16.489 --> 23:18.090
Jean?

23:18.124 --> 23:19.658
I'm naked! Hold on
I'm naked!.

23:30.169 --> 23:32.204
Good morning!

23:32.238 --> 23:34.740
Ooooh how's your up brain there?

23:36.542 --> 23:38.644
You like that matcha.

23:38.677 --> 23:39.879
You will hit the floor.

23:40.946 --> 23:42.214
It's up two inches too.

23:42.248 --> 23:44.550
I thought it was another
trip to the hospital.

23:46.652 --> 23:48.522
Whew, okay, up, up, up, up.

23:48.554 --> 23:49.455
Stand up!

23:49.488 --> 23:51.424
Okay, hold out your arms out.

24:29.161 --> 24:30.896
Let's sit outside.

24:32.131 --> 24:33.533
It's drink and beautiful.

24:35.034 --> 24:38.704
Drink'n beautiful, drink'n
beautiful, drink'n beautiful.

24:40.072 --> 24:43.142
Drink'n beautiful, drink'n
beautiful, drink'n beautiful.

24:43.175 --> 24:45.344
Morcotscot!

24:52.318 --> 24:53.652
Well I have three.

24:53.686 --> 24:56.021
I have two goldfinches
that are gay.

24:56.055 --> 24:57.990
My sister, Catherine,
died from cancer.

24:59.125 --> 25:00.759
She doesn't have
the energy medicine

25:00.793 --> 25:02.795
but we can still help Adam.

25:04.363 --> 25:05.664
I'll be right back.

25:07.601 --> 25:08.801
I should go.

25:08.834 --> 25:10.202
No, no, no, no,
I cleaned your pee.

25:10.236 --> 25:11.538
It's not like you're a prisoner.

25:11.571 --> 25:13.372
just outside in the open air.

25:19.245 --> 25:20.379
Did you grab my phone?

25:20.412 --> 25:21.447
I didn't see it.

25:21.480 --> 25:24.183
Okay this, is volume two.

25:26.719 --> 25:28.087
The handbook, my handbook.

25:28.120 --> 25:30.322
Okay well we'll
smudge it, smudge it.

25:32.358 --> 25:34.026
Enceladism is truth.

25:34.894 --> 25:36.262
I should call Aleah.

25:36.295 --> 25:38.430
You know I was
sitting, last night

25:38.464 --> 25:41.033
with you in my heart
and Adam in my heart

25:41.066 --> 25:42.868
and thinking and sending
healing energy and

25:42.902 --> 25:46.205
And I was just thinking,
Adam doesn't need to suffer.

25:46.238 --> 25:47.641
Nat doesn't need
to suffer, right?

25:47.673 --> 25:48.508
I mean

25:49.708 --> 25:51.611
Listen to your heart, Jean!

25:51.645 --> 25:53.746
Like like like
Jefferson Starship.

25:53.779 --> 25:55.381
Or, I think Jefferson Starship?

25:57.082 --> 26:01.287
The moment I met you, I knew
you were a healer like me.

26:04.190 --> 26:05.559
I gonnna I'm gonna cry.

26:07.126 --> 26:10.564
Your visions are the pain body

26:10.597 --> 26:12.364
trying to break free!

26:12.398 --> 26:16.202
You can transcend the
suffering in this world

26:16.235 --> 26:18.170
and really help people.

26:18.204 --> 26:22.642
And Adam getting cancer
and you getting sober,

26:22.676 --> 26:23.776
the timing is divine.

26:23.809 --> 26:26.111
There is nothing accidental!

26:27.514 --> 26:32.051
Spirit shows us when it is time

26:32.084 --> 26:33.886
to take things to
the next level.

26:36.021 --> 26:38.424
Awaken to your higher purpose.

26:40.392 --> 26:42.828
Everything will be all right.

26:52.771 --> 26:53.607
Aleah?

27:02.214 --> 27:03.048
Aleah?

27:27.773 --> 27:28.941
Don't open your eyes.

27:32.077 --> 27:33.647
I'm disgusting.

27:33.680 --> 27:36.382
If you're not ready
to quit, it's fine.

27:36.415 --> 27:38.518
Just don't shut me out

27:38.551 --> 27:39.351
and don't run off

27:39.385 --> 27:41.820
with ass Chad in Ames.

27:41.854 --> 27:44.790
You're my family and I need you

27:44.823 --> 27:46.559
to be here for me
too, especially when

27:46.593 --> 27:48.327
fucked up shit
like this happens.

27:51.130 --> 27:52.798
You have no idea
how they got in?

27:53.733 --> 27:54.567
No.

27:56.770 --> 27:57.970
Just get a phone.

27:58.003 --> 27:59.204
Get like a little
burner or something

27:59.238 --> 28:00.674
and call me with
the number, okay?

28:04.678 --> 28:07.146
You and my sister and
Sadie are all I have left.

28:08.581 --> 28:12.284
I'm just trying to keep
it together too, you know?

28:14.053 --> 28:14.953
I love you.

28:18.357 --> 28:19.793
I love you too.

28:28.100 --> 28:29.134
Da ta!

28:30.670 --> 28:31.504
You like it?

28:32.639 --> 28:34.273
I didn't
know you could draw

28:34.306 --> 28:35.307
I can?.

28:36.676 --> 28:40.513
This is gonna be just
like our usual meditation,

28:40.547 --> 28:44.483
just a little more, okay?

28:52.057 --> 28:56.696
This is an herbal tea with
some mild psychotropic agents.

28:57.797 --> 28:58.631
It's vegan.

29:01.300 --> 29:02.368
Oh, wait, don't
drink the whole...

29:02.401 --> 29:03.636
Oh, it's hot.

29:03.670 --> 29:06.271
Well, I was, we were
gonna share that but...

29:06.305 --> 29:07.373
What am I gonna die now?

29:08.874 --> 29:09.709
No.

29:13.078 --> 29:17.049
Oxygen amplifies the breath

29:17.082 --> 29:18.651
to purify the lymph.

29:20.185 --> 29:21.186
Love is like oxygen

29:25.090 --> 29:27.192
Now I want you to go
straight back, open to flow.

29:28.795 --> 29:31.096
♪ Little shop,
little shop of horrors ♪

29:35.367 --> 29:38.270
Okay now the breath of
fire is gonna activate

29:38.303 --> 29:40.205
the crown chakra, okay?

29:41.508 --> 29:44.076
And I want you to send
all your healing energy

29:44.109 --> 29:45.911
to Adam with your intention.

29:51.016 --> 29:54.420
Alright, let that
breath purify your blood.

29:56.556 --> 29:58.223
Blood carries a unique power.

29:58.257 --> 30:00.794
It is the living imprint
of our intention.

30:02.729 --> 30:05.899
Thoughts radiate out as
golden globes of energy.

30:07.700 --> 30:10.369
Thoughts, become things.

31:18.403 --> 31:19.806
Mom!

31:19.839 --> 31:21.674
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon baby!

31:24.176 --> 31:25.210
Adam!

31:27.079 --> 31:28.413
C'mon, no don't.

31:28.447 --> 31:29.248
Oh, God, c'mon baby.

31:29.281 --> 31:30.148
No, don't die!

31:40.392 --> 31:42.862
Don't die, don't fuckin'
die on me please!

31:50.737 --> 31:52.939
C'mon, c'mon, stay with me!

32:06.953 --> 32:09.022
Hi! Hi hi it's Jean.

32:11.658 --> 32:12.659
I. I fucked up.

32:38.116 --> 32:38.952
Nat?

32:41.219 --> 32:42.722
Oh, you scared me.

32:45.992 --> 32:47.594
Nat, this is Pete.

32:49.161 --> 32:50.930
Good morning, Nat.

32:51.864 --> 32:52.999
His is Pete.

32:54.299 --> 32:55.969
Good morning, Nat.

32:56.002 --> 32:56.803
Pete.

32:58.337 --> 33:00.405
Good morning, Nat.

33:00.439 --> 33:03.610
This is Pete
, this is Pete.

33:03.643 --> 33:04.476
Papa.

33:05.377 --> 33:06.913
It sounded like he said papa.

33:08.982 --> 33:11.116
He's still
pretty stoned,

33:11.149 --> 33:12.685
he's still pretty stoned.

33:13.886 --> 33:16.022
May I get you
a cool glass of water?

33:34.841 --> 33:36.743
Hey. You can
understand me, right?

33:38.811 --> 33:40.113
Thank you for not dying.

33:43.049 --> 33:45.217
I chickened out I'm sorry.

33:45.250 --> 33:46.986
I started thinking
about going to jail

33:47.020 --> 33:49.022
so I called Pete but
he came right away.

33:49.055 --> 33:50.023
Can you believe it?

33:51.824 --> 33:54.060
Pete, from the books.

33:54.093 --> 33:55.862
He's the one that
wrote the books!

33:59.297 --> 34:01.668
You've been asleep for
two days but you're fine.

34:02.568 --> 34:03.636
Please be respectful.

34:30.630 --> 34:32.364
I should go
check on the shop.

34:33.966 --> 34:34.934
Would you stay with him?

34:34.967 --> 34:35.802
Of course.

34:37.335 --> 34:39.105
Pete's gonna
keep an eye on you.

34:39.138 --> 34:40.005
Okay would you please?

34:44.844 --> 34:45.678
Fazem

34:47.112 --> 34:48.581
He's so stoned

34:50.949 --> 34:52.552
Mild lopho, yeah?

34:53.619 --> 34:55.521
Temporary paralysis is common.

34:58.157 --> 35:01.594
but that aura.

35:03.129 --> 35:05.565
I was beginning to think
you were all extinct.

35:14.107 --> 35:14.941
See ya.

35:16.341 --> 35:17.176
Yeah.

35:18.343 --> 35:20.345
Is there anything you
need while I'm out?

35:21.446 --> 35:22.615
Do you need anything?

35:25.518 --> 35:26.351
Flately

35:28.588 --> 35:31.691
He said your toilet
tissue is too sandpapery

35:31.724 --> 35:33.425
and have you anything softer?

35:34.861 --> 35:36.162
Sure, okay.

35:36.195 --> 35:37.897
I'll just be for a few hours.

35:39.599 --> 35:41.734
Pete, thank you.

35:43.803 --> 35:45.805
I still can't
believe you're here!

36:01.453 --> 36:02.922
There you are.

36:05.423 --> 36:06.859
How is everything?

36:06.893 --> 36:08.426
Very
good, thank you.

36:09.996 --> 36:11.964
Oh, sweetie, you
have a little something

36:11.998 --> 36:13.232
stuck in your teeth there.

36:14.667 --> 36:16.068
Up, yeah.

36:16.102 --> 36:16.936
It's a little beef.

36:18.370 --> 36:20.006
- Nice.
- You're down at 23.

36:20.039 --> 36:20.873
Heard

36:22.041 --> 36:24.610
Good afternoon,
welcome to Voltaire.

36:24.644 --> 36:26.546
I'm having
trouble reading the menu.

36:27.580 --> 36:29.048
Sit down and help me read.

36:32.985 --> 36:34.587
Is this the beef sandwich?

36:35.453 --> 36:36.689
Yeah, which, which...

36:36.722 --> 36:39.892
Sweetie, you've
a little something

36:39.926 --> 36:41.894
stuck in your teeth.

36:41.928 --> 36:42.929
There.

36:45.798 --> 36:46.632
Beef.

37:04.150 --> 37:05.651
Give me a towel!

37:07.520 --> 37:09.088
Aleah!

37:20.600 --> 37:21.968
You know to get
that energy build up

37:22.001 --> 37:23.903
in my chest, you know.

37:27.139 --> 37:28.440
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you know.

37:28.473 --> 37:30.610
It's like go up
through the diaphragm.

37:30.643 --> 37:31.878
You know that punch.

37:34.347 --> 37:35.615
And release.

37:35.648 --> 37:36.481
Fascinating.

37:37.884 --> 37:42.088
Jean, I was thinking next
week is the solstice.

37:42.121 --> 37:46.893
I could stay until then and
then maybe you could process.

37:48.094 --> 37:49.762
Are you serious?

37:49.795 --> 37:52.698
When I first met you,
your energy stayed with me.

37:53.633 --> 37:55.467
And lately I've-

37:59.538 --> 38:00.806
Are you okay?

38:02.407 --> 38:03.242
What's wrong?

38:10.116 --> 38:12.417
I've fallen out
of my master's favor.

38:15.221 --> 38:16.656
I'm...

38:18.423 --> 38:21.928
D-Y-I-N-G.

38:21.961 --> 38:22.795
What?

38:25.364 --> 38:28.301
No, no way.

38:32.872 --> 38:33.706
But I...

38:35.675 --> 38:38.311
You're so young!

38:38.344 --> 38:40.379
And so
handsome too, right?

38:46.786 --> 38:50.656
We don't choose
Encedalism, it chooses us.

38:50.690 --> 38:53.526
I was nine when I
swallowed my destiny.

38:55.061 --> 38:58.831
It's long and lonely when you
have the truth inside you,

38:58.864 --> 38:59.765
you know?

39:01.133 --> 39:05.705
But when Encendalists process,
there's nothing like it.

39:07.106 --> 39:11.410
Blood communion, every cell
in the body rejuvenates

39:12.445 --> 39:14.280
and the work can go on.

39:14.313 --> 39:17.416
I spent my entire
life in service,

39:17.450 --> 39:21.554
seeking those gifted
ones ready to awaken

39:21.587 --> 39:25.691
to their higher purpose,
their inner healer.

39:27.026 --> 39:31.664
Jean, the world needs
Encedalism now more than ever,

39:31.697 --> 39:33.799
not more poison and cutting.

39:36.569 --> 39:41.107
After you've processed,
you'll be able to train others

39:41.140 --> 39:41.974
when I'm gone.

39:49.348 --> 39:51.817
Hey, what about Nat?

39:51.851 --> 39:53.285
What about Nat?

39:55.821 --> 39:57.757
He's gifted, right?

39:58.724 --> 40:00.793
You said he was an alcoholic.

40:00.826 --> 40:03.162
Well but he had 30
days before his relapse.

40:04.630 --> 40:07.501
It's dangerous to tempt
an addict with this power.

40:07.533 --> 40:08.367
Please.

40:11.270 --> 40:12.772
We can do it together.

40:12.805 --> 40:13.806
He trusts me!

40:15.207 --> 40:18.277
His partner is dying of cancer.

40:18.310 --> 40:19.979
I told him I'd help.

40:22.815 --> 40:25.251
In Gaelic we call it

40:25.284 --> 40:26.952
babhláil

40:28.087 --> 40:32.191
I help Nat, so maybe
you can help me?

40:32.224 --> 40:33.059
Deal!

40:37.797 --> 40:38.597
What?

40:41.467 --> 40:42.701
Good morning, papa.

40:42.735 --> 40:44.637
Hey, how you feeling?

40:45.704 --> 40:46.506
Hey hey hey!

40:48.307 --> 40:49.275
Time it is?

40:49.308 --> 40:51.444
Ummm I don't know, Ten-ish.

40:51.477 --> 40:52.278
What?

40:52.311 --> 40:53.112
Eight.

40:55.214 --> 40:56.415
Who's he?

40:56.449 --> 40:57.249
That's Pete.

40:58.651 --> 41:00.352
Hey, you want some rice?

41:00.386 --> 41:01.487
No, I want to see Adam.

41:01.521 --> 41:04.090
Honey, you should really rest.

41:04.123 --> 41:05.057
No, he should rest.

41:05.091 --> 41:05.958
It's...

41:05.991 --> 41:06.826
Jean!

41:18.037 --> 41:20.039
I'll leave
the door unlocked!

41:25.678 --> 41:26.513
Oh!

41:28.180 --> 41:29.014
Let him.

42:58.270 --> 42:59.071
Hi!

43:04.578 --> 43:05.878
Hi.

43:05.911 --> 43:06.745
Shhh!

43:07.846 --> 43:08.781
What are you doing?

43:09.481 --> 43:10.584
I wanted to see you.

43:11.585 --> 43:12.418
I called you.

43:14.320 --> 43:15.555
How you feel?

43:17.156 --> 43:17.990
I feel better.

43:20.025 --> 43:20.859
Talk to me.

43:24.196 --> 43:27.534
Uhhh... on Sunday
I got really sick.

43:27.567 --> 43:30.936
I was throwing up this,
like, black vomit.

43:30.970 --> 43:31.837
It was crazy.

43:31.870 --> 43:33.172
Mom wanted to go to the hospital

43:33.205 --> 43:36.509
but I felt like I
just needed to sleep.

43:36.543 --> 43:37.943
And I slept for
like fourteen hours

43:37.977 --> 43:39.778
and I didn't have
any nightmares.

43:41.180 --> 43:43.683
When I woke up I felt...

43:43.717 --> 43:44.551
different.

43:46.986 --> 43:48.387
Where have you been?

43:49.623 --> 43:50.489
That's awesome.

43:52.191 --> 43:53.660
God is awesome.

43:54.728 --> 43:55.394
That's awesome.

43:57.597 --> 43:58.831
Have you been drinking?

44:01.400 --> 44:02.434
You smell like booze.

44:03.503 --> 44:05.404
That's what God smells like.

44:08.575 --> 44:09.408
Nat?

44:13.245 --> 44:15.615
Everything's gonna be alright.

44:24.557 --> 44:26.292
Cassette is better than MP3.

44:27.860 --> 44:29.061
Okay, we're diving deep.

44:30.429 --> 44:32.699
No time to waste
sit up straight,

44:32.732 --> 44:35.200
visualize the form,
call out the disease.

44:37.537 --> 44:40.039
Jean and I will be right here.

44:54.953 --> 44:59.793
♪ Encel-a, Encel-a-dism ♪

45:44.103 --> 45:45.437
Focus intention.

45:46.539 --> 45:48.842
Harness the power to heal.

46:50.235 --> 46:51.604
Are you kidding me?

46:55.842 --> 46:57.644
Feel the power!

46:57.677 --> 46:58.444
Yes man!

46:58.477 --> 46:59.311
Yes!

47:19.364 --> 47:20.900
Get out of the fuckin' way!

47:49.662 --> 47:50.563
Don't!

47:51.396 --> 47:52.231
Touch her.

47:53.633 --> 47:58.638
Fuck it hurts!

48:21.493 --> 48:22.729
It's a tumor!

48:24.496 --> 48:26.599
It was a tumor.

48:26.633 --> 48:27.867
Now it's nothing.

48:32.371 --> 48:33.673
You said her?

48:35.140 --> 48:36.743
Hey look, look, look!

48:38.310 --> 48:40.212
This is a Saturn Star!

48:40.245 --> 48:41.079
This!

48:42.214 --> 48:44.182
Burnt right into the rock!

48:45.117 --> 48:46.686
This is a Saturn star you know!

48:53.458 --> 48:54.794
Can you feel it?

48:57.597 --> 48:58.430
Yeah.

48:59.966 --> 49:01.534
You're perfect.

49:03.402 --> 49:06.438
I won't tolerate ignorance.

49:10.843 --> 49:13.913
And if you ever play
that fucking trumpet

49:13.947 --> 49:15.180
during ritual again.

50:02.662 --> 50:05.531
If you're gonna get sick,
turn your head to the side.

50:05.565 --> 50:06.799
Don't get it on my pants.

50:10.870 --> 50:14.641
Did you call her
mom, ma, or mother?

50:16.408 --> 50:17.242
Mom.

50:19.545 --> 50:21.213
Can you feel that?

50:22.815 --> 50:23.650
Yeah.

50:24.751 --> 50:27.020
That's your father
stuck in there.

50:29.088 --> 50:29.922
Yeah.

50:32.625 --> 50:34.493
He was gifted like you

50:35.762 --> 50:36.929
But he was a coward.

50:46.238 --> 50:48.675
You'll be a powerful Encedalist.

50:51.376 --> 50:53.378
I'm only doing
this to help Adam.

50:53.412 --> 50:55.280
When he's better, I'm done.

51:00.385 --> 51:02.021
She wants to be important.

51:02.055 --> 51:02.889
Don't look.

51:04.824 --> 51:06.025
She's jealous of you.

51:08.995 --> 51:09.962
Jean's good to me.

51:11.631 --> 51:12.832
She wants to fuck you.

51:16.569 --> 51:17.537
Nat.

51:17.570 --> 51:18.403
Let go!

51:39.391 --> 51:41.928
I speak my mind,
I can't bullshit.

51:43.930 --> 51:45.565
Encedalism is truth.

51:45.598 --> 51:48.067
But if you're unstable,
people could get hurt.

51:50.036 --> 51:52.304
I'm not a social
worker but I can help.

51:54.107 --> 51:55.307
I don't need your help.

51:56.241 --> 51:57.076
Give it a rest.

51:59.478 --> 52:01.848
I know what you want,
I know what you are

52:01.881 --> 52:02.882
and it's natural.

52:04.183 --> 52:07.086
You'll save Adam's
life, you will!

52:08.221 --> 52:10.056
But you could save
so many others.

52:11.958 --> 52:14.193
It's your purpose and
you need to own it

52:15.427 --> 52:16.963
But we need to do the work.

52:18.765 --> 52:22.201
We need to....

52:30.143 --> 52:31.077
You okay?

52:36.182 --> 52:37.382
I'm fine.

54:38.070 --> 54:43.042
En-cel-a-dism.

54:52.718 --> 54:55.621
En-cel-a-dism.

55:02.061 --> 55:03.963
Aleah!

55:05.497 --> 55:08.034
Aleah, that's not your house!

55:08.067 --> 55:09.702
Try the doorbell!

55:09.735 --> 55:11.370
Leave me alone!

55:11.404 --> 55:14.173
Aleah, I I I'm Jean's son

55:14.206 --> 55:15.440
Nat's boss Jean.

55:15.473 --> 55:17.109
Jean wants you to
leave Kansas City.

55:17.143 --> 55:19.578
Jean doesn't like you.

55:19.612 --> 55:20.980
Fuck off!

55:21.013 --> 55:21.847
Aleah...

55:22.815 --> 55:23.649
Look.

55:24.784 --> 55:25.918
I kissed your niece.

55:27.086 --> 55:28.387
Bye, bye baby!

55:28.421 --> 55:29.789
No!

55:33.726 --> 55:34.560
Sadie!

55:51.610 --> 55:52.845
Welcome
to Flourish I flourish

55:52.878 --> 55:53.713
when you fl...

55:53.746 --> 55:55.214
Where's Jean?

55:55.247 --> 55:56.415
Hey!

55:56.449 --> 55:57.249
Hey, Aleah

55:57.283 --> 56:00.119
Who the fuck is Jimmy?

56:00.152 --> 56:02.088
- Who's Jimmy?
- The kid with the mask.

56:02.121 --> 56:03.189
Who the fuck is he?

56:03.222 --> 56:04.690
Hey, hey, I don't know
who you're talkin' about.

56:04.724 --> 56:05.358
Where's Nat?

56:05.391 --> 56:06.425
You need to calm down.

56:06.459 --> 56:08.227
Don't fucking tell
me to calm down!

56:08.260 --> 56:09.862
Who the fuck is Jimmy?

56:09.895 --> 56:11.197
Who's Jimmy?

56:11.230 --> 56:12.431
- I don't know!
- Where's Nat?

56:12.465 --> 56:13.899
I don't know what
you're talking about.

56:13.933 --> 56:14.734
Where is Nat?

56:16.535 --> 56:18.604
He's in Ames?

56:18.637 --> 56:20.606
Why is he in Ames?

56:20.639 --> 56:22.241
Maybe that's none
of your business.

56:29.849 --> 56:30.683
Hey.

56:39.558 --> 56:42.628
You ever thought about
trying Encedalism?

57:33.879 --> 57:36.550
I made some music
for our process.

57:42.354 --> 57:43.389
You hate mushrooms?

57:48.562 --> 57:49.361
It's good.

57:50.663 --> 57:51.497
Thanks.

57:55.668 --> 57:57.169
Hey, have you talked
to Aleah lately?

57:57.203 --> 58:00.139
I bet I can guess what one
of your songs sounds like.

58:41.881 --> 58:43.682
I got us some wine.

58:43.716 --> 58:45.519
Oh, Pete he's sob....

58:48.154 --> 58:49.589
I didn't mean to!

58:49.623 --> 58:51.558
I didn't mean to, I'm sorry!

58:53.325 --> 58:56.162
Jean, if you want to
start a clown service

58:56.195 --> 58:57.763
then go start a clown service.

59:00.366 --> 59:02.134
I saved Adam.

01:00:32.124 --> 01:00:32.958
Nathan.

01:00:47.973 --> 01:00:49.275
Stop please!

01:00:49.308 --> 01:00:50.376
Ugh I'm sorry, Nat!

01:00:52.911 --> 01:00:55.047
It was non-sexual touch I... I...

01:00:56.348 --> 01:00:58.652
I didn't mean, I just, I just...

01:01:34.253 --> 01:01:35.622
You look nice.

01:01:35.655 --> 01:01:37.289
Thanks.

01:01:37.323 --> 01:01:38.257
Speak your truth.

01:01:39.358 --> 01:01:41.528
You've worked hard for this.

01:01:44.029 --> 01:01:46.633
We
don't choose encedalism.

01:01:46.666 --> 01:01:49.034
It chooses us.

01:01:49.068 --> 01:01:52.905
It's long and lonely with
the truth inside you,

01:01:52.938 --> 01:01:53.740
you know?

01:01:55.407 --> 01:01:57.943
But when Encedalists process,

01:01:57.976 --> 01:01:59.512
there's nothing like it.

01:02:00.979 --> 01:02:05.417
Blood communion, every cell
in the body rejuvenates

01:02:06.151 --> 01:02:07.620
and the work can go on.

01:02:07.654 --> 01:02:11.023
I spent my entire
life in service

01:02:11.056 --> 01:02:15.127
seeking those gifted
ones ready to awaken

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:17.764
to their higher purpose

01:02:17.797 --> 01:02:19.398
Their inner healer.

01:02:30.042 --> 01:02:30.876
I'm hurrying.

01:02:36.915 --> 01:02:38.685
What are you doing here?

01:02:38.718 --> 01:02:39.686
You look amazing.

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:42.555
Why haven't you
returned my calls?

01:02:42.589 --> 01:02:44.156
Shhh trust me, I'll explain.

01:02:44.189 --> 01:02:46.058
Does mom know you're here?

01:02:46.091 --> 01:02:47.393
Yeah, she sent the limo.

01:02:53.899 --> 01:02:54.701
This is you.

01:02:58.070 --> 01:02:59.304
It's a miracle, right?

01:03:03.942 --> 01:03:04.778
Come here!

01:03:32.505 --> 01:03:34.273
I don't think you
can prepare yourself

01:03:34.306 --> 01:03:35.575
to feel the power of God.

01:03:39.879 --> 01:03:41.480
I felt heat in my body.

01:03:43.081 --> 01:03:43.917
Body heat.

01:03:45.718 --> 01:03:48.420
Then every muscle in my
body would start to cramp up.

01:03:49.455 --> 01:03:51.490
It hurt so bad.

01:03:54.561 --> 01:03:56.896
I wanted to thank you
all for your prayers.

01:03:59.998 --> 01:04:00.834
God was listening.

01:04:02.702 --> 01:04:03.770
I give glory to God.

01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:09.876
You need to leave.

01:04:12.612 --> 01:04:13.613
I really don't.

01:04:15.615 --> 01:04:16.616
I'll walk you out.

01:04:19.151 --> 01:04:21.588
- Hold on, hold on.
- Mom!

01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:23.790
Uh, oh.

01:04:25.123 --> 01:04:26.024
- Come on, momma, wait.
- No.

01:04:26.058 --> 01:04:28.026
Look, this is a good day.

01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:29.428
You need to leave!

01:04:29.461 --> 01:04:30.930
Look, stop, just listen!

01:04:33.465 --> 01:04:34.501
I healed Adam.

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:36.669
- I love hi...
- Stop!

01:04:38.705 --> 01:04:40.105
Fuck that hurt.

01:05:11.436 --> 01:05:12.237
I love you.

01:05:16.441 --> 01:05:17.242
Nat.

01:05:19.044 --> 01:05:19.879
I love you.

01:05:26.619 --> 01:05:28.053
Maybe you should go.

01:05:40.098 --> 01:05:41.634
I can give it.

01:05:42.802 --> 01:05:44.737
And I can take it away.

01:06:30.482 --> 01:06:31.383
Hook me up.

01:06:35.722 --> 01:06:36.723
Make a fist.

01:06:51.236 --> 01:06:52.038
Relax.

01:06:54.073 --> 01:06:55.541
Thank you
Lord for another day.

01:06:55.575 --> 01:06:58.678
Thank you for everything
that you've done for Lord.

01:06:58.711 --> 01:07:00.647
And thank
you for our health

01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:03.883
and thank you for your power
to work miracles in our lives.

01:07:23.503 --> 01:07:24.336
Barter.

01:07:27.272 --> 01:07:29.075
Your destiny and mine.

01:07:32.045 --> 01:07:34.179
Seven-point-six million souls

01:07:37.150 --> 01:07:39.317
mastery and service.

01:07:56.769 --> 01:07:58.104
Mom!

01:08:21.259 --> 01:08:22.227
Stop!

01:08:25.765 --> 01:08:26.966
Pete stop!

01:09:00.499 --> 01:09:02.068
Pete, Nat?

01:09:03.236 --> 01:09:05.071
Mmmmm smells like
a process feast!

01:09:08.741 --> 01:09:09.575
Who turned off the oven?

01:09:10.977 --> 01:09:12.245
Pete? Pete!

01:09:13.679 --> 01:09:15.715
Hey, you guys can't start the
show without me!

01:09:29.595 --> 01:09:30.630
Show's over.

01:09:51.117 --> 01:09:52.285
No!

01:09:59.659 --> 01:10:00.492
No, no!

01:10:35.995 --> 01:10:37.964
What?

01:10:37.997 --> 01:10:39.665
We're pulling out.

01:10:39.699 --> 01:10:40.933
But what...

01:10:40.967 --> 01:10:42.602
Get everything out
of the house by noon.

01:10:42.635 --> 01:10:43.603
No, no, but...

01:10:43.636 --> 01:10:44.904
Report to Armik in Victoria.

01:10:44.937 --> 01:10:46.806
But what about the girl?

01:10:46.839 --> 01:10:48.774
That's no longer an option.

01:10:48.808 --> 01:10:50.209
No, no, no, no, no,

01:10:50.243 --> 01:10:51.210
yes it is an option!

01:10:51.244 --> 01:10:52.178
I did my job!

01:10:52.211 --> 01:10:53.478
You said I could process!

01:10:53.512 --> 01:10:54.747
Noon.

01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:57.116
Wait, will you
just listen to me?

01:10:58.284 --> 01:11:00.385
I deserve a second chance, Pete!

01:11:04.422 --> 01:11:05.258
Pete?

01:11:10.296 --> 01:11:11.731
Pete?

01:11:11.764 --> 01:11:12.598
Noon.

01:11:19.272 --> 01:11:20.573
Aleah!

01:11:32.718 --> 01:11:34.053
If
this is the side salad,

01:11:34.086 --> 01:11:35.655
how big is the regular salad?

01:11:37.323 --> 01:11:40.492
And I asked for
dressing on the side.

01:11:40.526 --> 01:11:42.762
Aleah!

01:11:46.065 --> 01:11:46.866
Hello?

01:11:52.271 --> 01:11:53.639
I want her address.

01:11:54.774 --> 01:11:55.574
Now!

01:12:11.691 --> 01:12:12.858
Oww my hand!

01:12:12.892 --> 01:12:13.726
I hate you!

01:12:35.014 --> 01:12:35.982
Aleah!

01:13:41.147 --> 01:13:43.215
Stop screaming!

01:14:21.854 --> 01:14:22.922
Aleah?

01:14:53.252 --> 01:14:54.353
You lie!

01:14:56.355 --> 01:14:58.525
I deserve a second chance!

01:15:00.392 --> 01:15:02.061
Not this time

01:15:02.094 --> 01:15:03.929
Not tonight!

01:15:03.963 --> 01:15:05.798
You always lie!

01:15:06.966 --> 01:15:08.568
I did my job!

01:15:27.052 --> 01:15:28.888
She's mine to process.

01:15:42.201 --> 01:15:45.271
One, two, a'three.

01:15:48.407 --> 01:15:49.643
Do, do, do, do,

01:15:50.843 --> 01:15:54.113
do, da, do, da, do,
do, do.

01:16:42.461 --> 01:16:43.295
Mmmmm...

01:16:46.932 --> 01:16:49.902
Pa yem a tell ayyy

01:16:51.170 --> 01:16:54.273

- Pa yem a tell ayyy

01:17:13.359 --> 01:17:15.528
You foolish fairy!

01:17:16.795 --> 01:17:19.798
This wretch makes me new!

01:17:19.832 --> 01:17:21.166
makes me new!

01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:22.768
I go on!

01:17:22.801 --> 01:17:24.937
I go on!

01:17:24.970 --> 01:17:26.138
I uhhh-

01:17:27.273 --> 01:17:29.174
Oh! No! No! No!

01:17:30.142 --> 01:17:31.711
Wait! Oh, wait!

01:17:33.245 --> 01:17:34.714
Master!

01:17:34.748 --> 01:17:35.715
Don't leave me!

01:18:03.342 --> 01:18:05.144
Dyaaat Chennn!

01:18:26.566 --> 01:18:28.568
Dyatt Chennn

01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:39.044
Beloved!

01:19:00.232 --> 01:19:03.969
This Wretch makes me new.

01:19:51.116 --> 01:19:54.788
En... cel... ahhh...

01:19:55.822 --> 01:19:59.224
Dizzzummm!!!!

01:21:32.417 --> 01:21:33.252
Nat!

01:21:37.055 --> 01:21:39.324
Aleah...

01:22:18.531 --> 01:22:21.066
Nat! Can you hear me?

01:22:24.938 --> 01:22:27.574
Okay. I'm taking us
to the hospital, okay?

01:22:27.607 --> 01:22:29.876
I'm gonna take us
to the hospital

01:22:29.909 --> 01:22:31.578
or the urgent care.

01:22:32.812 --> 01:22:34.714
I'm gonna get us there. I'm
gonna get us to a hospital

01:22:37.082 --> 01:22:39.117
Everything... Everything's
gonna be all right.

01:23:05.578 --> 01:23:07.680
Master.

01:24:34.067 --> 01:24:36.468
We don't
choose Encedalism.

01:24:39.739 --> 01:24:40.907
It chooses us.

01:24:54.486 --> 01:24:57.757
I was nine when I
swallowed my destiny.

01:25:09.769 --> 01:25:13.773
It's long and lonely with the
truth inside you, you know?

01:25:18.544 --> 01:25:20.880
But when Encedalists process

01:25:26.052 --> 01:25:28.054
there's nothing like it.

01:25:33.793 --> 01:25:34.794
Blood communion.

01:25:37.797 --> 01:25:40.499
Every cell in the
body rejuvenates.

01:25:43.503 --> 01:25:45.437
and the work can go on.

01:25:50.308 --> 01:25:53.079
I spent my entire
life in service

01:25:57.984 --> 01:26:01.419
seeking those gifted
ones ready to awaken

01:26:05.825 --> 01:26:07.827
to their higher purpose,

01:26:15.433 --> 01:26:17.170
their inner healer.
