WEBVTT

00:04.838 --> 00:06.897
Shall I continue to delay dinner, madam?

00:06.973 --> 00:10.636
Yes, Geoffrey. I don't know where he is.
He's never late without calling.

00:10.710 --> 00:13.679
- Do you think Daddy's all right?
- It's awfully late, Mom.

00:13.747 --> 00:18.150
Okay, let's not jump to any conclusions.
We're all worried, but let's...

00:20.120 --> 00:23.283
Bill Cosby has a streetwise niece
coming on his show.

00:23.356 --> 00:24.823
That should be decent.

00:27.193 --> 00:28.820
- I'm home.
- Daddy.

00:28.895 --> 00:31.523
- Philip, where have you been?
- I was at the office.

00:31.598 --> 00:35.591
I'm sorry I didn't call, but I wanted
to rush home with the great news.

00:35.668 --> 00:37.602
What is the highest recognition...

00:37.670 --> 00:39.900
a self-made Black professional
can receive?

00:39.973 --> 00:41.304
A raise!

00:43.510 --> 00:45.740
No, darling, it's not a raise.

00:46.179 --> 00:49.171
I'm getting the Urban Spirit Award.

00:49.816 --> 00:53.513
- Philip, we're so proud of you.
- Is it a cash award?

00:55.522 --> 00:57.922
Hilary, don't be so shortsighted.

00:57.991 --> 01:01.154
This award is an honor
which leads to prestige...

01:01.628 --> 01:03.391
which leads to cash.

01:04.864 --> 01:07.025
The community leaders
are recognizing me...

01:07.100 --> 01:09.625
for helping our brothers
and sisters on the streets.

01:09.702 --> 01:11.533
The only time you're on the streets...

01:11.604 --> 01:15.062
is when you're waiting
for the valet to bring your car around.

01:15.141 --> 01:18.042
Is that so, son? Let me tell you something.

01:18.545 --> 01:21.742
The '63 March on Washington?
I was there.

01:22.048 --> 01:24.983
The '65 demonstrations at Selma,
I was there.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.713
The '65 Watts Riots, I was there, too.

01:28.888 --> 01:32.051
Seems to me every place you go,
trouble follows.

01:35.962 --> 01:40.558
Your uncle deserves this award.
He's fought a lot of discrimination cases.

01:40.633 --> 01:44.034
He's prosecuted slumlords.
He's started scholarship funds.

01:44.104 --> 01:47.801
All that and he still found time
to vote for Reagan. Twice.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.273
Thank you, sweetheart.

01:50.343 --> 01:54.302
It wouldn't be bad if you could remember
some of that when the reporter gets here.

01:54.380 --> 01:57.372
- Reporter?
- Photographer? New dress.

01:59.686 --> 02:03.213
All right, you can have a new dress.
I want you all to look your best...

02:03.289 --> 02:05.849
for the newspaper interview
and the awards banquet.

02:05.925 --> 02:09.292
Daddy, this is wonderful.
Two new dresses.

02:10.430 --> 02:12.057
Have you called your parents?

02:12.132 --> 02:14.430
You bet. They're taking the next plane out.

02:14.501 --> 02:17.470
Great. Grandma and Grandpa
are coming to visit.

02:17.537 --> 02:18.629
Toys.

02:20.000 --> 02:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:28.641 --> 03:32.543
Oh, yeah. That's it. Come on, Ash.
Rock this funky joint, baby.

03:33.012 --> 03:36.880
Come on, Ash. Less like George Michael,
more like Hammer. Come on.

03:36.950 --> 03:40.408
That's it. Baby, you got to put
some more butt into it.

03:41.788 --> 03:43.517
That's it. Yeah.

03:44.490 --> 03:47.015
Excuse me,
but Grandma and Grandpa are here.

03:47.093 --> 03:49.823
I just saw the cab pull up the driveway.

03:51.397 --> 03:53.865
- Grandpa.
- Sweet potato.

03:54.601 --> 03:59.231
- Grandma.
- Ashley, sweetie. My, how you've grown.

03:59.772 --> 04:04.300
Hilary, sweetie. My, how you've grown.

04:04.844 --> 04:08.211
Carlton, sweetie. Hi.

04:10.583 --> 04:13.381
Grandma, Grandpa, this is my cousin Will.

04:14.187 --> 04:17.088
Hi, Will. Your uncle told us all about you.

04:18.124 --> 04:22.060
I don't know, Hattie.
He don't look like the devil incarnate.

04:24.597 --> 04:28.124
Thanks. So, how was the flight
from Baltimore?

04:28.534 --> 04:31.799
- Baltimore?
- That's where Uncle Phil's from, right?

04:32.005 --> 04:36.374
He moved there when he was 16,
but he was born and raised in Yamacraw.

04:36.542 --> 04:40.034
- Yamacraw?
- North Carolina.

04:40.847 --> 04:43.611
I can't believe Zeke
never mentioned his hometown.

04:43.683 --> 04:44.775
Zeke?

04:46.686 --> 04:48.210
Mama. Pop.

04:50.189 --> 04:51.781
Hey, Uncle Zeke.

04:53.559 --> 04:56.084
- Give your old man a hug.
- Okay, Pop.

04:56.929 --> 05:01.423
<i>Am I tripping, or does this remind you
of the last episode of Family Ties?</i>

05:04.837 --> 05:07.203
Daddy, didn't I send you money
for a new suit?

05:07.273 --> 05:09.867
You're looking at it.
When you sent that money...

05:09.942 --> 05:13.343
me and my buddy Leroy
went down to the dry goods store...

05:13.413 --> 05:17.679
and we each got a suit, a fishing rod,
and some radial tires.

05:19.952 --> 05:24.412
Well, I guess I better
get to fixing supper. Geoffrey.

05:27.226 --> 05:29.421
This is what I'll be needing.

05:31.431 --> 05:33.228
"One pound of lard...

05:33.666 --> 05:35.861
"four handfuls poke greens...

05:36.469 --> 05:39.597
"and a big old slab of fatback."

05:42.141 --> 05:45.941
Now, if it comes to more than $1,
they're cheating you.

05:46.646 --> 05:50.047
We are going to have pork chops,
collard greens...

05:50.116 --> 05:53.051
baked macaroni, and sweet potato pie.

05:54.921 --> 05:56.286
Have mercy!

06:01.494 --> 06:04.190
Grandma, Grandpa,
you want to go see our swimming pool?

06:04.263 --> 06:05.457
That's a good idea.

06:05.531 --> 06:09.797
Growing up, my Zeke always did love
our swimming hole.

06:09.869 --> 06:13.805
He would strip down
to his birthday suit and dive right in.

06:15.241 --> 06:17.937
Granny, please. It's almost dinnertime.

06:19.645 --> 06:23.172
He just loved his skinny-dipping,
him and Melvin.

06:23.883 --> 06:25.077
Melvin.

06:25.885 --> 06:27.785
I don't think we want to hear anything...

06:27.854 --> 06:31.153
<i>Au contraire, Dad.
The Melvin stories are priceless.</i>

06:32.558 --> 06:36.187
- So, Melvin was like his best friend?
- Melvin was his pig.

06:41.267 --> 06:44.464
I have plenty stories about my Zeke.

06:45.204 --> 06:49.072
- Are any of them humiliating stories?
- The best ones are.

06:51.277 --> 06:53.177
Let's start with those.

07:12.999 --> 07:15.297
It's 3:00 in the morning, Will.

07:18.104 --> 07:20.436
- How did you see me?
- Mama knows.

07:22.275 --> 07:27.144
Look, Granny, please don't tell Uncle Phil.
I'm just a little bit past my curfew.

07:28.347 --> 07:30.042
How much is a little?

07:30.116 --> 07:33.643
Let's just say I went out
after I was supposed to be in.

07:36.656 --> 07:40.592
- Don't do it again.
- All right. What are you doing up so late?

07:40.660 --> 07:43.788
Child, I had to get up
and get breakfast started.

07:43.863 --> 07:46.957
I don't know what you all got
that Geoffrey for.

07:48.534 --> 07:51.025
- Five-card draw?
- Yeah, I'm with it.

07:51.571 --> 07:55.940
Granny, I really like you. You and Grandpa,
you have fun. You tell jokes.

07:56.008 --> 07:59.569
- You all bust me up.
- Thank you, son.

08:00.379 --> 08:04.008
Hey, look, Granny, it's late,
everybody's asleep.

08:04.250 --> 08:07.515
You can level with me.
Uncle Phil's adopted, right?

08:10.089 --> 08:13.217
Now, we're real proud of Zeke.

08:14.026 --> 08:18.554
Did you know he won the Young Farmers
of America Pig Raising trophy?

08:20.166 --> 08:24.398
No, I didn't know that, but I'd love
to have some details about that.

08:25.004 --> 08:29.373
Won it four years running.
They had to retire his slop bucket.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.410
Slop bucket? I can't wait till he wakes up.

08:35.715 --> 08:37.706
Respect your elders, son.

08:39.118 --> 08:40.710
See, I beat you.

08:45.558 --> 08:50.325
You know, he was the first
Black president of the Young Farmers.

08:51.097 --> 08:54.999
- Was that like a big thing?
- Oh, my, yes!

08:56.669 --> 08:58.296
I beat you again.

09:04.277 --> 09:08.646
You know, then, we also
had those White rest rooms?

09:08.814 --> 09:09.906
Yeah.

09:11.117 --> 09:13.950
I remember this one time
we was downtown...

09:14.387 --> 09:16.947
and Zeke had had too much lemonade...

09:17.023 --> 09:19.719
and suddenly he just lit out from me...

09:19.792 --> 09:22.625
and split right into that White rest room.

09:23.729 --> 09:27.563
They told him to leave,
but little Zeke just stood his ground.

09:27.700 --> 09:29.463
Uncle Phil did that?

09:30.503 --> 09:32.630
Look here, I beat you again.

09:36.943 --> 09:39.571
All right, that reporter's going to be here
any minute.

09:39.645 --> 09:42.079
Does everybody remember
what they're supposed to say?

09:42.148 --> 09:43.342
- Hilary?
- Yes, Daddy.

09:43.416 --> 09:44.678
- Ashley?
- Yes, Daddy.

09:44.750 --> 09:45.944
Vivian?

09:46.586 --> 09:49.077
What is this, the von Trapp family?

09:50.222 --> 09:54.283
I'm not about to parrot compliments
for the benefit of some reporter.

09:54.360 --> 09:57.625
Let's not be naive, Vivian.
I've dealt with the press before.

09:57.697 --> 10:01.827
If you don't rehearse what you're going
to say, they eat you alive.

10:04.136 --> 10:05.194
Carlton?

10:05.271 --> 10:08.263
At the forefront
of the civil rights movement.

10:11.777 --> 10:13.244
You were asleep, son.

10:13.312 --> 10:16.179
Sorry, Dad. All of Grandma's pies
last night...

10:16.248 --> 10:17.579
and waffles this morning.

10:17.650 --> 10:22.212
I just crashed. I've got the sugar blues.
I'm this close to a crying jag.

10:24.123 --> 10:26.353
Ms. Melissa Klein, sir.

10:26.525 --> 10:28.322
<i>LA Press, "Urban Beat."</i>

10:30.296 --> 10:33.595
I'd like you to meet my family.
My wife Vivian...

10:34.200 --> 10:37.499
my son Carlton,
my daughters Hilary and Ashley.

10:38.070 --> 10:41.233
Pleased to meet you.
So where's the photographer?

10:41.874 --> 10:45.173
- Your father sent a picture in already.
- Am I in it?

10:45.478 --> 10:47.742
- Yes, you are.
- Am I pretty?

10:49.682 --> 10:52.207
Let's begin the interview, shall we?

10:52.785 --> 10:55.515
Mr. Banks, you're best known
as the lawyer...

10:55.588 --> 10:57.920
who won the landmark
housing discrimination case...

10:57.990 --> 10:59.617
<i>Winston vs. Jones...</i>

10:59.692 --> 11:02.923
but our readers want to know
about Philip Banks the man.

11:02.995 --> 11:06.055
Well, I really don't like
to blow my own horn.

11:09.535 --> 11:12.333
Growing up on the mean streets
of Baltimore, Maryland...

11:12.405 --> 11:14.737
Philip Banks overcame great obstacles...

11:14.807 --> 11:18.174
to win a scholarship
to Princeton University in 1963.

11:22.114 --> 11:26.517
You know, Hilary, Princeton
was the turning point in Philip Banks' life.

11:26.919 --> 11:29.820
It was then that he developed
an interest in law...

11:29.889 --> 11:32.824
and distinguished himself
as a fine student...

11:32.892 --> 11:35.884
earning himself a place
at Harvard Law School.

11:36.362 --> 11:38.227
That's right, Carlton.

11:39.465 --> 11:43.060
But did you know that Philip Banks,
in addition to becoming a partner...

11:43.135 --> 11:45.968
of the prestigious law firm
of Furth, Wynn, and Meyer...

11:46.038 --> 11:48.598
remained active in the field of civil rights...

11:48.674 --> 11:51.837
culminating in his crowning achievement
in 1975...

11:51.911 --> 11:55.210
when he was elected
to the board of the ASPCA.

11:59.952 --> 12:01.146
ASPCA?

12:01.220 --> 12:04.485
I think Ashley means NAACP.

12:07.526 --> 12:08.993
Sorry, Daddy.

12:20.539 --> 12:24.066
After living in Bel-Air,
it was great to spend time at Disneyland...

12:24.143 --> 12:26.043
to get back to reality.

12:29.014 --> 12:32.848
Joe, it's 7:30.
We're getting to be a couple of night owls.

12:32.918 --> 12:35.546
Yes, ma'am.
We better go put ourselves to bed.

12:35.621 --> 12:39.148
Honey, I'm with you. Good night, honey.

12:44.363 --> 12:47.196
Feature desk, please. Jake? Melissa.

12:47.266 --> 12:50.633
Look, I'm having second thoughts
about this Philip Banks piece.

12:50.703 --> 12:53.137
It's just one long, boring résumé.

12:53.239 --> 12:56.834
For a while there, I thought
I had an angle about the ASPCA...

12:56.909 --> 12:59.639
but that turned out to be a blind alley.

13:00.412 --> 13:04.849
I'm telling you, this man's life is boring.
His own son kept nodding out.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.379
We better kill the story. Okay. Bye.

13:09.255 --> 13:10.745
Hold up, lady.

13:10.956 --> 13:13.720
My uncle has been
looking forward to this all week.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.159
If you kill that story, he's gonna get mad.

13:16.228 --> 13:19.026
If he gets mad,
the heat comes down on me.

13:20.032 --> 13:24.025
Look, kid. You got to wake up
and smell the java. Your uncle's dull. Dull!

13:26.038 --> 13:29.269
Dull? Sweetheart,
that's one thing my uncle is not.

13:29.341 --> 13:32.504
Max out, lady.
I got a couple of stories for you.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.620
Oh, dear.

13:43.255 --> 13:46.315
- Good, Geoffrey. You got the paper.
- Yes, madam.

13:46.392 --> 13:49.293
Make sure you buy the 100 copies
that Mr. Banks wanted.

13:49.361 --> 13:52.694
Before we make such an investment,
perhaps it might be wise...

13:52.765 --> 13:55.825
for you to peruse
the contents of this article.

14:00.372 --> 14:01.634
Oh, dear.

14:03.275 --> 14:06.472
Geoffrey, how on earth did they
get a hold of all these stories?

14:06.545 --> 14:10.106
Madam, the press is made up
of a very low type of person.

14:10.516 --> 14:13.041
You see what they've done to Fergie.

14:14.587 --> 14:17.886
- Vivian, is it in the morning paper?
- Yeah.

14:17.957 --> 14:19.584
Good. You got the paper.

14:19.658 --> 14:22.821
Why don't you have
your morning coffee first, sir?

14:22.895 --> 14:27.332
That's perfect. I'll have my coffee,
and you can read it to me, Geoffrey.

14:27.566 --> 14:28.931
Yes, sir.

14:33.138 --> 14:35.834
"Local lawyer wins prestigious award."

14:37.977 --> 14:39.842
It goes on from there.

14:43.649 --> 14:46.641
- Goes on to what?
- Just details, really.

14:46.719 --> 14:49.415
- I'll just recycle this.
- Give it to me.

14:56.528 --> 14:58.655
"The coveted Urban Spirit Award...

14:58.731 --> 15:01.757
"given to Los Angeles'
outstanding Black leaders...

15:01.834 --> 15:05.770
"will be presented tonight
to distinguished attorney Philip Banks."

15:05.838 --> 15:07.635
This is well-written.

15:08.807 --> 15:11.708
"Known to his barnyard companions
as Zeke...

15:16.448 --> 15:18.939
"Banks is no stranger to accolades.

15:19.318 --> 15:21.218
"This ex-hog-handler...

15:22.855 --> 15:27.053
"slopped his way to the top

15:27.126 --> 15:28.753
"Melvin the pig."

15:32.298 --> 15:34.425
Who is responsible for this?

15:36.435 --> 15:39.268
Hey, Uncle Zeke.
I got your 100 black and whites.

15:39.338 --> 15:43.672
I can't believe this. How did they get
all these stories about the pig?

15:44.376 --> 15:47.743
All right, I wasn't going to tell you, but...

15:53.519 --> 15:55.953
- You!
- Will, honey...

15:57.022 --> 15:58.080
run.

16:01.160 --> 16:03.219
- What did I do?
- What did you do?

16:03.295 --> 16:06.162
- You destroyed my image.
- I didn't destroy nothing.

16:06.231 --> 16:08.324
Of course you did. Look at that story.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.595
I have to walk
into that banquet room tonight...

16:10.669 --> 16:15.003
filled with people who'll think I'm nothing
but a hog-handling hick from Yamacraw.

16:15.074 --> 16:18.202
- But that is where you come from, Zeke.
- Mama.

16:18.644 --> 16:23.013
- I was just having a few words with Will.
- And I'm having a few words with you.

16:23.082 --> 16:25.573
What have you got to be ashamed of?

16:25.651 --> 16:29.178
We always put food on the table
and clothes on your back.

16:29.254 --> 16:31.119
Mama, I'm not ashamed.

16:31.390 --> 16:35.349
There are just certain aspects of my life
I don't wish emphasized.

16:35.427 --> 16:39.625
Where I come from
they call that being ashamed...

16:40.699 --> 16:42.633
Mr. Big Shot!

16:56.115 --> 16:59.278
Mother, you look very nice
in your dress tonight.

17:00.919 --> 17:04.480
- Did you enjoy the limousine ride, Pop?
- You bet. I went...

17:07.792 --> 17:10.522
Hattie, aren't you going to talk at all?

17:11.296 --> 17:15.596
Come on. We're mature adults.
Refusing to speak won't solve anything.

17:15.867 --> 17:19.031
- That's right, Uncle Phil.
- I'm not talking to you.

17:19.905 --> 17:22.703
Philip, Vivian, congratulations.

17:22.875 --> 17:25.742
Yes, we're all quite proud of you
at the office, old man.

17:25.810 --> 17:28.609
Thank you.
I'd like you to meet my parents.

17:28.680 --> 17:31.740
Hattie and Joe Banks,
Henry and Margaret Furth.

17:33.485 --> 17:36.454
Ma'am, would you like the salmon
or chateaubriand?

17:36.522 --> 17:41.084
We don't want to be a bother.
We'll just hang on to these empty plates.

17:41.260 --> 17:42.887
Thank you kindly.

17:44.596 --> 17:47.190
Are you sure you don't want
any of the food?

17:47.266 --> 17:51.600
We don't want to impose.
We'll just fade into the background.

17:54.373 --> 17:58.469
- Breast or wing?
- I think I'll have a wing, thank you.

17:59.511 --> 18:01.536
Got any okra casserole?

18:03.215 --> 18:06.184
- Coming up.
- Granny.

18:06.485 --> 18:09.784
You know how much Uncle Phil
likes his mama's okra casserole.

18:09.855 --> 18:13.951
- Why don't you ask him if he wants some?
- It ain't going to work, Will.

18:14.026 --> 18:18.190
What is this interesting mélange?
It smells divine.

18:19.364 --> 18:21.992
Just plain old okra and tomato, honey.

18:23.135 --> 18:25.228
Delicious. Try that, Henry.

18:28.807 --> 18:31.867
Outstanding. Do we have any biscuits?

18:35.614 --> 18:37.605
I hope they're still hot.

18:40.052 --> 18:42.145
Can I say something please?

18:42.354 --> 18:45.221
I just know that at a time like this...

18:45.290 --> 18:50.023
my uncle Phil is extremely happy to have
his two loving parents here with him.

18:50.629 --> 18:53.063
I can feel the love at this table.

18:55.400 --> 18:56.628
Parents?

18:57.236 --> 19:01.434
To hear him tell it, he just sprung
full-grown from the ground...

19:01.640 --> 19:04.040
and we had nothing to do with it.

19:05.077 --> 19:08.171
Yes, he just sprung up
like a big old eggplant.

19:11.450 --> 19:12.781
Excuse me.

19:21.560 --> 19:25.326
- Excuse me, sir. Aren't you Philip Banks?
- Yes.

19:25.397 --> 19:27.797
You're the hog-slopping lawyer.

19:27.866 --> 19:30.494
I saw your picture in the paper
this morning.

19:31.036 --> 19:33.527
Is Melvin going to be here tonight?

19:34.173 --> 19:36.903
No, Melvin eschews these type of events.

19:37.709 --> 19:39.336
I'm the same way.

19:42.981 --> 19:45.176
What are you doing in here, Uncle Phil?

19:45.250 --> 19:48.947
<i>Is this for your own information,
or will this be in USA Today?</i>

19:49.588 --> 19:51.317
Come on, I'm sorry I made you mad.

19:51.390 --> 19:55.019
The reporter was gonna trash the article
until I gave her those pig stories.

19:55.093 --> 19:59.052
Yes. Everyone loves those
amusing little agricultural anecdotes.

19:59.631 --> 20:03.226
I guess it never occurred to you
that they'd make me look like a fool.

20:03.302 --> 20:07.102
Uncle Phil, your plaid golf shorts
make you look like a fool.

20:07.573 --> 20:09.200
Those stories make you look great.

20:09.274 --> 20:12.038
You did a lot for Black people
that I didn't even know.

20:12.110 --> 20:14.635
I raised a pig
for the Young Farmers Association.

20:14.713 --> 20:17.773
Puts me right up there
with Martin Luther King.

20:19.151 --> 20:21.984
You were the first Black president.
That's something.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.147
And what about
the Whites only rest room?

20:24.223 --> 20:26.623
In case my mother
didn't make it painfully clear...

20:26.692 --> 20:28.489
I wasn't trying to prove a point.

20:28.560 --> 20:32.963
- I went in there because I really had to go.
- I see a whole lot of that.

20:36.235 --> 20:39.136
I mean, look, Uncle Phil,
it's just like Rosa Parks.

20:39.204 --> 20:43.231
When she sat in the front of the bus,
she wasn't doing it to prove a point either.

20:43.308 --> 20:45.071
She did it 'cause her feet hurt.

20:45.143 --> 20:48.670
They told her to leave, and she didn't.
Neither did you.

20:50.849 --> 20:55.013
I must be kidding myself.
I had it all planned out.

20:56.321 --> 20:59.415
There was my family,
all lined up to meet the press.

20:59.491 --> 21:01.925
There I was, with my perfect image.

21:02.327 --> 21:06.730
Philip Banks pulled himself up
from the streets with his own bootstraps.

21:08.400 --> 21:11.563
The only problem was,
I didn't have it that hard.

21:12.604 --> 21:16.472
I had two parents who loved me
and were always there for me...

21:17.576 --> 21:21.103
and worked hard to make sure
I'd have everything they never had.

21:21.179 --> 21:23.977
I mean, why are you worried
so much about your image?

21:24.049 --> 21:26.449
The truth sounds real good to me.

21:26.652 --> 21:28.882
I don't think my mother
will ever forgive me.

21:28.954 --> 21:33.015
Man, you must be tripping.
Granny's great. Just explain it to her.

21:33.825 --> 21:36.658
Will, there's something you have to learn.

21:38.030 --> 21:41.295
Sometimes parents just don't understand.

21:48.206 --> 21:52.267
In addition to the civil rights cases
he has won as an attorney...

21:53.011 --> 21:57.414
Philip Banks is a community leader,
an unsparing philanthropist...

21:57.616 --> 22:00.016
and a role model to all citizens.

22:00.519 --> 22:03.010
Ladies and gentlemen, Philip Banks.

22:12.731 --> 22:14.722
Thank you.

22:16.735 --> 22:19.363
I grew up on the streets of Baltimore.

22:22.274 --> 22:25.641
But I was born on a farm in Yamacraw,
North Carolina.

22:27.446 --> 22:29.573
I was one of the lucky ones.

22:30.816 --> 22:35.150
I had two wonderful parents
who worked hard every day of their lives.

22:37.656 --> 22:40.591
They couldn't give me
a lot of material things...

22:40.659 --> 22:43.992
but they gave me morals, courage...

22:46.198 --> 22:48.530
and most important of all, love.

22:50.535 --> 22:53.527
I just hope I can give the next generation...

22:55.207 --> 22:57.175
what my parents gave me.

22:59.144 --> 23:01.772
I hope he mentions his pig.

23:02.305 --> 23:08.560
