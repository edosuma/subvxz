01:15.120 --> 01:19.079
<i>And now live from the Cayman Islands,
the Home Swapping Network.</i>

01:19.320 --> 01:21.470
<i>Where you can swap
that old crap you bought...</i>

01:21.720 --> 01:26.510
<i>...from some other shopping network
for some entirely new crap from us.</i>

01:26.760 --> 01:29.911
And they say there's nothing
good on TV.

01:30.880 --> 01:34.236
Hi, guys. You wanna catch
a Woody Allen movie with me?

01:34.880 --> 01:37.633
I don't know. Woody Allen's
never really done it for me.

01:37.880 --> 01:40.155
But then again,
I'm not his step-daughter, so...

01:44.360 --> 01:47.796
You know, besides, Al, Jefferson,
and the rest of the fat pack...

01:48.040 --> 01:51.828
...will be home soon
from losing their bowling semi-finals.

01:52.040 --> 01:54.156
Yeah, I wonder if they let Bud play
this year.

01:54.360 --> 01:57.750
- Why wouldn't they?
- Well, he's an alternate.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.195
Yeah, and he stinks.

02:00.600 --> 02:03.831
Well, that's not fair. He sucks.

02:04.320 --> 02:07.949
But-- But in his defense, he blows.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.998
Well, here they come.
Now, if you listen very carefully...

02:15.240 --> 02:18.357
...you can actually hear
the footfalls of failure.

02:34.080 --> 02:36.548
Al, you won?

02:36.760 --> 02:40.912
We are festooned and beribboned,
are we not?

02:41.800 --> 02:43.199
"Best of Breed"?

02:43.400 --> 02:46.915
Well, Teddy's Veterinarian Clinic
donated them.

02:47.440 --> 02:49.670
Last year's winners got shots.

02:49.880 --> 02:52.633
Last year's losers got neutered.

02:53.280 --> 02:55.714
I thought you guys
were last year's losers.

03:00.560 --> 03:03.916
Hey, speaking of neutered,
did Bud get to bowl?

03:04.720 --> 03:08.269
Well, actually, pumpkin, he helped us
in much more important ways.

03:14.920 --> 03:16.433
Hi.

03:18.240 --> 03:20.754
No, no, you guys, just relax.
Relax, I got it.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.592
No, let me help you there, son.

03:23.440 --> 03:25.590
Just put them down there anywhere.

03:31.040 --> 03:33.918
That's the best damn alternate
in the league.

03:34.680 --> 03:36.193
Well, men...

03:36.400 --> 03:39.392
...one more victory and we bring home
the Puggy Weaver Cup.

03:39.600 --> 03:41.556
- The Puggy Weaver.
- Can't wait.

03:42.120 --> 03:43.189
Who's Puggy Weaver?

03:46.600 --> 03:50.479
Only the most honored bowler
in the history of Jim's Bowlerama.

03:50.720 --> 03:51.789
He's dead now.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.675
But he symbolized the Olympian ideal
of pure competition.

03:55.920 --> 03:58.309
- How did he die?
- He choked to death...

03:58.560 --> 04:00.949
...trying to swallow eight waffles.

04:01.800 --> 04:06.999
We tried to stop him at seven,
but he was going for the record.

04:07.600 --> 04:09.750
What an athlete.

04:11.040 --> 04:13.600
Get a grip, Bob Rooney.

04:14.160 --> 04:16.720
All right, in 10 days we bowl
for the championship...

04:16.920 --> 04:19.228
...which means we start
intense training.

04:19.440 --> 04:21.908
Twinkies, Ding-Dongs
and beer are in.

04:22.120 --> 04:24.680
Protect your bowling arms
at all times.

04:24.880 --> 04:27.110
Sex before the match is out.

04:27.880 --> 04:31.190
Unless, of course, you can keep it
secret from the wives.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.311
Lock it down!

04:39.320 --> 04:43.916
For the eighth and final time,
what are you morons doing?

04:44.720 --> 04:46.915
Well-- Well, ma'am,
if you had taken the time...

04:47.120 --> 04:49.270
...to read page 19
of the sports section...

04:49.480 --> 04:51.948
...beneath the high school
track and field results...

04:52.160 --> 04:54.754
...you would know that we,
Gary's Angels...

04:54.960 --> 04:58.270
...are bowling against A.J.'s Casketeria
next week...

04:58.480 --> 05:02.189
...for the prestigious
Puggy Weaver Memorial Cup.

05:06.880 --> 05:11.476
Good, because I thought this was
the worst puppet show I've ever seen.

05:11.920 --> 05:15.754
Now, what size am I?

05:16.360 --> 05:19.909
Well, I'm no expert,
but from where I sit, I'd say...

05:20.120 --> 05:21.473
...too big for shoes.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.760
I'll have your jobs for this.

05:28.960 --> 05:32.350
Fine. If we can trade
for what's in your fridge.

05:39.520 --> 05:43.399
You know, this wouldn't be a bad job
if people didn't come in here.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.070
Hey, Al, do you mind
if I knock off early?

05:46.320 --> 05:48.276
Sure. Go ahead, buddy.

05:49.040 --> 05:51.076
But remember, no sex.

05:51.880 --> 05:54.553
Farthest thing from my mind.

06:01.400 --> 06:04.153
I guess I'll tidy up around here
a little bit.

06:05.200 --> 06:08.351
Of course, there's not much you
can do with one hand up in the air.

06:12.520 --> 06:14.988
Except put the other one up.

06:31.960 --> 06:33.518
Al?

06:34.720 --> 06:37.314
Oh, you're in the bathroom, huh?

06:41.360 --> 06:42.998
Al!

06:43.400 --> 06:45.834
Your arm is down!

06:47.520 --> 06:48.839
Wait, wait, wait a second.

06:51.960 --> 06:54.394
What happened, Al?
Were you robbed?

06:55.160 --> 06:59.790
No, Kathy Ireland came in here, tied
me up and we had wild sex all night.

07:04.840 --> 07:06.159
Cool.

07:06.360 --> 07:08.749
Same thing happened to me.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.912
Untie me, you moron!

07:14.040 --> 07:15.871
Hey, Al...

07:16.080 --> 07:18.389
...your arm is down.

07:19.120 --> 07:21.156
Hey. Hey, what happened?

07:21.400 --> 07:25.313
- Well, apparently Kathy Ireland came--
- Shut up!

07:25.920 --> 07:28.957
Jefferson, it was awful. Some guy
came in here and tried to rob me.

07:29.160 --> 07:30.912
He tried to make me
open the register...

07:31.120 --> 07:33.839
...and it had been so long
I'd forgotten how.

07:34.080 --> 07:37.550
Then he took me in here and he tied
me up and I had to sit here all night...

07:37.760 --> 07:42.151
...surrounded by shoes.
Oh, it was awful.

07:44.440 --> 07:47.830
Hey. Hey, I just had a thought.

07:48.080 --> 07:50.514
Have you ever heard
of stress-related illnesses?

07:50.760 --> 07:52.113
No. What are those?

07:52.320 --> 07:54.914
They're bull, but they've made
people millions of dollars.

07:55.120 --> 07:56.678
All you have to do...

07:56.880 --> 07:58.757
...is say that you've been
traumatized...

07:58.960 --> 08:01.793
...and you can't work around shoes
anymore and then sue.

08:02.040 --> 08:05.237
- Sue? Sue who?
- Everybody.

08:05.480 --> 08:07.357
Believe me.
Al, malls across America...

08:07.560 --> 08:11.348
...set aside millions of dollars
for just this type of frivolous lawsuit.

08:11.560 --> 08:15.109
It's the American way, Al. And if these
millions are not spent on lawsuits...

08:15.320 --> 08:18.517
...they go to social security,
then nobody gets it.

08:25.560 --> 08:27.357
Jefferson, I'll do it.

08:27.560 --> 08:31.269
Damn.
I wish I'd been tied up and robbed.

08:32.559 --> 08:35.028
Well, actually, I did get tied up.

08:37.880 --> 08:40.519
But I didn't get robbed.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.719
Hey, wait a minute!

08:46.000 --> 08:47.752
Hey, Peg, guess what.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.515
Al, before you go to work
would you take out the trash?

08:52.960 --> 08:54.871
No, Peg, you don't understand.

08:55.080 --> 08:56.877
I've got something important
to tell you.

08:57.080 --> 08:59.116
I know it's not as important
as Richard Bey...

08:59.320 --> 09:02.517
...running around with a condom
on his head, but it's all I got.

09:03.560 --> 09:06.791
- What is it, Al?
- I'm suing the mall, Peg.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.195
All I gotta do is pretend
I'm afraid of shoes...

09:09.400 --> 09:13.393
...and not get caught wearing them,
and they give me a bunch of money.

09:19.160 --> 09:22.516
Bad news, Al.
For some ungodly reason...

09:22.720 --> 09:26.110
...they seem to be cracking down
on frivolous lawsuits.

09:26.360 --> 09:28.669
The mall just hired
a private investigator.

09:28.880 --> 09:32.873
He trailed me here.
I tried to shake him at the nudie bar--

09:34.760 --> 09:36.830
I mean...

09:37.280 --> 09:39.510
I got here as soon as I could.

09:39.720 --> 09:43.190
Look, they just wanna be sure
that you're really afraid of shoes.

09:43.400 --> 09:45.072
So how convincing can you be?

09:46.000 --> 09:48.355
How convincing can I be?

10:00.200 --> 10:04.273
Now, it may appear
that I enjoyed that...

10:05.440 --> 10:09.592
...when in actuality,
I'm choking on my own bile.

10:11.520 --> 10:13.476
You fooled me.

10:13.920 --> 10:16.957
That's him.
Okay, remember, stay cool.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.873
Our lives are in your feet.

10:20.800 --> 10:23.394
That's why life stinks.

10:26.200 --> 10:30.034
Hi, I'm Leslie Baum,
private investigator.

10:30.240 --> 10:34.631
I represent the New Market Mall in your
frivolous $4-million lawsuit.

10:35.360 --> 10:36.793
Charmed.

10:37.040 --> 10:38.917
Look, Bundy,
I'll tell you straight out...

10:39.120 --> 10:40.678
...I think you're a fraud.

10:40.880 --> 10:42.359
Oh, yeah?

10:42.560 --> 10:46.235
Well, with a name like Leslie,
I think you're a sissy.

10:51.120 --> 10:52.075
What was that?

10:52.280 --> 10:55.033
"Come on in.
Stay a week and try to disprove...

10:55.240 --> 10:58.277
...my cockamamie little shoe story"?
Don't mind if I do.

10:59.800 --> 11:02.633
Hey, Baum,
you can't just barge in here.

11:03.480 --> 11:07.359
Well, why don't you just put on
your shoes and kick me out?

11:08.200 --> 11:09.713
You're damn right I will!

11:12.720 --> 11:14.597
Will not...

11:16.040 --> 11:17.439
...because...

11:19.480 --> 11:22.392
...I'm afraid of shoes, you see?

11:23.160 --> 11:25.469
Tell you what, Mr. Bundy.

11:25.680 --> 11:28.956
You have one week to convince me
that you are afraid of shoes.

11:29.160 --> 11:33.153
I have one week to prove
that you're the biggest fool alive.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.794
Right now, my money's on me.

11:36.400 --> 11:40.598
So feeling lucky, Bundy?

11:44.720 --> 11:46.517
Let's rock.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.833
<i>Today on Geraldo:</i>

11:56.240 --> 12:00.552
<i>People who survived
being on Jenny Jones.</i>

12:03.640 --> 12:08.316
Mrs. Bundy, I couldn't help but notice
that you're really attached to your TV.

12:10.920 --> 12:13.593
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.

12:13.800 --> 12:16.189
My TV was talking.

12:17.240 --> 12:19.834
You know, if you're willing
to help me out here...

12:20.040 --> 12:23.237
...there just might be
a 40-incher in it for you.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.877
Mr. Baum.

12:34.840 --> 12:38.230
I meant a big-screen TV.

12:39.240 --> 12:43.119
You mean, you want me to sell out
the man that I've been married to for--?

12:43.560 --> 12:46.028
Is that picture in a picture?

12:49.160 --> 12:50.673
Well, I can't. I won't.

12:50.880 --> 12:54.509
I'm telling you, Mr. Baum,
Al really is afraid of shoes.

12:54.720 --> 12:59.316
Look, Mrs. Bundy, I can spot a liar
a mile away and I'll prove it.

12:59.520 --> 13:01.875
For instance, take your son there.

13:02.080 --> 13:05.550
Looks like he's reading, but if you'll
notice, his eyes aren't moving.

13:09.520 --> 13:12.318
That usually denotes
that he's looking at a picture.

13:12.520 --> 13:16.433
From the little beads of sweat
on his forehead, I think it folds out.

13:18.160 --> 13:21.516
He should be heading upstairs
any time now.

13:42.240 --> 13:45.676
Al, you gotta be careful.
This guy is good.

13:45.880 --> 13:49.236
Don't worry, Peg, all I gotta do
is go three more days.

13:49.440 --> 13:52.591
If I can serve 20 years with you,
I can--

13:53.920 --> 13:57.959
I can handle 72 hours
with squirrel boy.

14:01.280 --> 14:05.273
Al, quick, grab the bags.
They moved the finals to tonight.

14:05.520 --> 14:06.999
Zounds.

14:07.200 --> 14:09.919
Well, we better hurry.
Bud, ready our balls!

14:10.120 --> 14:11.997
Men, to the alley.

14:13.080 --> 14:15.116
One little problem, though,
Mr. Bundy.

14:15.320 --> 14:18.312
Don't you usually bowl in shoes?

14:20.720 --> 14:22.597
He's right, Al.

14:22.800 --> 14:24.279
It's time to:

14:31.000 --> 14:33.833
He said, "Lose the scam."

14:34.240 --> 14:36.629
It's not a scam.
Don't worry, men.

14:36.880 --> 14:39.474
I know a way to get my 4 million
and the Puggy.

14:39.680 --> 14:42.353
Al Bundy will not fail.

14:44.080 --> 14:47.152
I wonder if Bundy and the shoe flies
are even gonna show.

14:47.400 --> 14:50.039
I don't know. In the high-pressured
world of shoe sales...

14:50.240 --> 14:52.959
...you just don't wake up and go.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.468
Wait a minute.
Who's bringing their work home?

15:12.560 --> 15:15.597
Oh, it's just Bundy with no shoes on.

15:15.920 --> 15:17.831
That's cute, Milt.

15:18.080 --> 15:19.957
How's business?

15:20.640 --> 15:24.076
- Dig up a new wife?
- Come on. All right, come on.

15:24.280 --> 15:26.555
We'll settle this
on the alley of honor.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.438
Fine, Bundy.
We're gonna bury you.

15:28.640 --> 15:31.359
And then we're gonna steal
your watch.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.356
Let's bowl, dead boys.

15:39.680 --> 15:41.477
Okay. So, Al...

15:41.680 --> 15:44.114
...what's this brilliant master plan
that can't fail?

15:44.360 --> 15:46.920
I am going to bowl...

15:47.360 --> 15:48.952
...barefoot.

15:49.920 --> 15:51.148
And?

15:51.760 --> 15:53.273
That's it.

15:54.080 --> 15:56.799
- Well, that's better than nothing.
- That is nothing.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.753
Don't worry about it.
This championship is as good as ours.

16:07.560 --> 16:09.551
You need shoes.

16:10.120 --> 16:11.394
Why can't I bowl barefoot?

16:11.640 --> 16:13.915
Because we had a guy in here
who bowled barefoot...

16:14.120 --> 16:18.159
...fell, got a splinter,
and sued us for $1 .5 million.

16:18.360 --> 16:21.955
So the new rule is, you need shoes.

16:23.360 --> 16:24.918
What are we gonna do?

16:25.120 --> 16:27.759
Well, we're gonna have to go
with our alternate.

16:28.600 --> 16:29.919
Bud.

16:30.120 --> 16:32.554
But he stinks.

16:32.800 --> 16:34.791
He's my son!

16:35.000 --> 16:37.468
Don't you think I know he stinks?

16:39.240 --> 16:42.277
But he's a Bundy.
I'll give him a pep talk, he'll bowl fine.

16:42.480 --> 16:45.233
Bud boy. I need to talk to you, son.

16:45.440 --> 16:49.592
What? Someone need to wipe
their hands on the back of my shirt?

16:51.080 --> 16:52.513
Son.

16:52.920 --> 16:55.593
Remember that time you didn't make
the Little League team...

16:55.800 --> 16:58.075
...and you came home crying...

16:58.280 --> 17:00.635
...and I said it was okay
because you did your best?

17:01.920 --> 17:04.798
- Yeah.
- Well, that was a crock.

17:06.000 --> 17:10.232
I was ashamed of you then
and remain so to this day.

17:10.680 --> 17:13.147
I'm gonna give you a second chance.
I need you to bowl.

17:13.359 --> 17:16.829
I need you to bowl well.
I need you to win.

17:17.480 --> 17:19.948
Can you do that for your pa?

17:21.359 --> 17:23.749
- I haven't bowled for a while. I don't--
- He's in!

17:24.000 --> 17:26.230
All right! Yes!

17:28.800 --> 17:30.313
Go take a practice throw, son.

17:30.520 --> 17:33.159
You see, that's the good thing
about being a Bundy.

17:33.360 --> 17:36.272
Even though the chips may be down
and things look bad...

17:36.480 --> 17:39.392
...every time we-- Incoming!

17:42.880 --> 17:45.713
God, you stink!

17:47.200 --> 17:49.589
Look, Bundy, I like you...

17:49.800 --> 17:55.432
...so I took the liberty
of securing you a pair of these.

17:57.680 --> 18:01.229
Why, those are
Air Earl Anthony 5000s.

18:02.200 --> 18:04.395
The finest bowling shoes made.

18:04.600 --> 18:06.477
Put them on.

18:06.680 --> 18:09.956
Don't do it, Al. It's $4 million.

18:11.160 --> 18:13.628
Let the games begin.

18:59.280 --> 19:01.874
Now, son, listen to me
very carefully.

19:02.080 --> 19:03.718
Last frame.

19:03.920 --> 19:05.911
We're down by nine.

19:06.160 --> 19:11.188
You have two shots to knock
all 10 pins down and we win.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.431
Can you do it, son?

19:14.240 --> 19:17.710
- Dad, I'm a little rusty. I don't--
- Piece of cake!

19:17.960 --> 19:19.678
Come on, Bud. Come on.

19:19.880 --> 19:25.273
Okay, Bud. Okay.
Whatever you do don't leave a split.

19:27.640 --> 19:30.598
Gee, I wonder what's
gonna happen now.

19:33.880 --> 19:35.836
Yes. He left a six-seven-ten.

19:36.040 --> 19:38.838
He'll never be able to pick up
the six-seven-ten. We won.

19:39.040 --> 19:40.393
We're resurrected.

19:45.280 --> 19:46.952
Stop!

20:03.520 --> 20:06.876
Daddy's got a new pair of shoes.

20:28.800 --> 20:31.360
Yes! Yes!

20:31.600 --> 20:33.158
Yes!

20:34.400 --> 20:35.833
You're the man.

20:45.760 --> 20:48.433
Look, Peggy, the Puggy.

20:49.520 --> 20:51.272
Can you feel the excitement?

20:52.120 --> 20:53.439
No, Al.

20:53.640 --> 20:57.633
As usual, when you're excited,
I feel nothing.

20:59.240 --> 21:01.515
It's the 4 million, isn't it?

21:02.680 --> 21:03.874
Why did you do it, Al?

21:04.080 --> 21:06.594
Why did you snuff out any hope at all
for a better life?

21:07.720 --> 21:11.076
Well, it's a guy thing, Peg.

21:11.760 --> 21:15.036
I couldn't let a couple of bucks come
between me and my friends...

21:15.240 --> 21:18.277
...they wouldn't talk to me anymore
and then I'd just have...

21:18.520 --> 21:20.238
...you.

21:21.040 --> 21:24.316
Hey, Al, hurry up.
The winner's ball is starting.

21:24.520 --> 21:29.230
Oh, and Griff has already eaten
the crust off all the pies.

21:31.360 --> 21:34.397
Oh, Peg, can life be better?

21:34.880 --> 21:36.108
Sadly...

21:36.320 --> 21:37.275
...pathetically...

21:37.480 --> 21:39.118
...no.
