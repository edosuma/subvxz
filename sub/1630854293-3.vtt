WEBVTT

00:23.023 --> 00:23.936
Ah!

00:25.677 --> 00:28.550
Nobody moves, nobody dies!

00:30.291 --> 00:31.640
Lock 'em in the
conference room.

00:31.683 --> 00:34.034
Take their phones.

00:41.084 --> 00:42.868
Hey, phone in the bag now.

00:44.740 --> 00:46.959
Should be over here somewhere.

00:47.003 --> 00:48.135
This wall.

00:48.178 --> 00:50.398
Help me move these.

00:54.924 --> 00:56.447
Just like you said.

01:00.103 --> 01:03.019
Prep the exit,
then make the call.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.375
Appreciate you lugging
all this stuff.

01:11.419 --> 01:13.116
I'll be honest,
when I volunteered,

01:13.160 --> 01:15.597
I didn't think your church
was gonna wrangle up

01:15.640 --> 01:16.859
this many donations.

01:16.902 --> 01:18.469
- What's in here, bricks?
- Ah.

01:18.513 --> 01:20.689
They got landline
telephones, laptops...

01:20.732 --> 01:22.517
Nichelle's COPE program
needs the resources

01:22.560 --> 01:25.607
- and people are stepping up.
- I guess nobody
wanted to part with

01:25.650 --> 01:27.043
iPads or anything lighter?

01:27.087 --> 01:29.480
Look at it this way,
you get to skip the gym.

01:29.524 --> 01:31.700
It's leg day.
I love leg day.

01:31.743 --> 01:33.876
Hey, guys, thank you both
for bringing this by.

01:33.919 --> 01:35.660
Oh, yeah, yeah.
No sweat.

01:35.704 --> 01:37.140
So, Annie tells me

01:37.184 --> 01:38.837
you have some news?

01:38.881 --> 01:40.709
Oh, I knew you two couldn't wait
till the baby is born.

01:40.752 --> 01:43.146
We wanted to, but we're
just too excited.

01:43.190 --> 01:45.670
And I have online
shopping carts ready to go.

01:45.714 --> 01:47.716
I need to know which one
to pull the trigger on.

01:47.759 --> 01:49.196
So, the baby's gender
is in there?

01:49.239 --> 01:50.545
And I haven't opened it.

01:50.588 --> 01:52.199
Annie agreed to bake us a cake

01:52.242 --> 01:54.375
for a little gender reveal
party this weekend,

01:54.418 --> 01:56.986
so she is the only one
allowed to know.

01:57.029 --> 01:59.380
Okay, well, normally
Annie and I don't keep secrets

01:59.423 --> 02:00.642
from each other,

02:00.685 --> 02:02.426
but in this case
I'll let it slide.

02:02.470 --> 02:04.428
Do not let this out
of your sight.

02:04.472 --> 02:06.038
You have my word.

02:08.258 --> 02:09.825
We got to get to Pacoima.

02:09.868 --> 02:11.218
Thanks. Be safe, guys.

02:11.261 --> 02:13.481
Okay.
Mm-hmm.

02:27.234 --> 02:30.280
All right. Listen up.
911 call came from inside.

02:30.324 --> 02:31.542
Caller said four gunmen

02:31.586 --> 02:32.978
busted in,
rounded everybody up,

02:33.022 --> 02:34.937
and then put a bullet in
a manager who resisted.

02:34.980 --> 02:36.765
If he's still alive, we got to
get him medical attention ASAP,

02:36.808 --> 02:38.767
so let's get in and get him out.

02:38.810 --> 02:40.290
How many potential hostages?

02:40.334 --> 02:42.162
Luckily, most of the employees
are working remote.

02:42.205 --> 02:44.251
Only five clocked in
this morning, plus the manager.

02:44.294 --> 02:45.948
Caller said they were
being corralled

02:45.991 --> 02:47.689
- before the call was dropped.
- Any sign of the shooters?

02:47.732 --> 02:49.560
Patrol got here fast,
set up a wide perimeter.

02:49.604 --> 02:50.909
Never saw the shooters exit,

02:50.953 --> 02:52.824
so we have to assume
they're still inside.

02:52.868 --> 02:54.130
Luca and I'll take
the three side.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.479
Deacon, you grab
Tan and Street,

02:55.523 --> 02:57.133
enter the two side.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.831
Let's secure the hostages
and get that wounded man out.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.923
Okay. Let's do this.

03:20.504 --> 03:22.245
Tan.

03:23.942 --> 03:25.422
30-David.
Set at the entry point,

03:25.466 --> 03:27.163
on the two side.
Checking the IR now.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.905
I got six bodies on IR,
huddled together.

03:29.948 --> 03:31.689
That's got to be
the employees.

03:31.733 --> 03:32.995
No visual on any gunmen.

03:33.038 --> 03:34.649
Hondo, we've located
the employees.

03:34.692 --> 03:36.999
No sign of the suspects.

03:37.042 --> 03:38.522
Copy that, Deac.

03:41.482 --> 03:42.657
We're good.

03:42.700 --> 03:44.398
No sign of suspects
on our end either.

03:44.441 --> 03:45.964
Prepare to make entry.

03:46.008 --> 03:50.491
All right, we do this quick
and quiet in three, two, one.

03:50.534 --> 03:51.970
Go.

04:09.988 --> 04:12.034
Not exactly sophisticated.

04:12.077 --> 04:13.253
Tan.

04:16.168 --> 04:17.213
No change.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.606
Looks like we're good.

04:18.649 --> 04:20.695
30-David. We are just
outside the conference room.

04:20.738 --> 04:22.305
Still no sign
of any shooters.

04:23.350 --> 04:25.526
Copy that, Deac.
We're clear here, too.

04:25.569 --> 04:27.267
Make entry.

04:27.310 --> 04:29.094
Get that wounded man out.

04:32.707 --> 04:33.925
LAPD.

04:33.969 --> 04:35.797
You're okay.
We're here to get you out.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.189
Where's the wounded?
Who got shot?

04:37.233 --> 04:39.104
What are you talking about?
Nobody was shot.

04:39.148 --> 04:40.889
Is this everyone
working today?

04:40.932 --> 04:42.543
Yes, just the six of us.

04:42.586 --> 04:44.545
Which one of you called 911?

04:44.588 --> 04:45.981
None of us.

04:46.024 --> 04:48.375
I think I heard
one of them make the call.

04:48.418 --> 04:49.898
Something's not right.

04:49.941 --> 04:52.335
Hondo, we've secured
the employees.

04:52.379 --> 04:53.902
No one's been shot.

04:53.945 --> 04:55.904
And whoever called 911--
it wasn't one of them.

04:55.947 --> 04:57.427
So, what the hell's
going on?

04:57.471 --> 05:01.779
- This is all a distraction.
- Yeah, but for what?

05:01.823 --> 05:03.041
Ready?

05:06.349 --> 05:08.395
Luca, check it out.

05:08.438 --> 05:10.222
This wasn't on the floor plan.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.964
20-David, we got
a hidden door to an old hallway.

05:13.008 --> 05:15.097
Our shooters might have ghosted.
We are pursuing.

05:15.140 --> 05:16.316
Luca, flashbang.

05:18.405 --> 05:19.841
Go.

05:25.455 --> 05:29.590
Yo, Hondo, check this out.
Coveralls. Four sets.

05:29.633 --> 05:31.461
They changed their clothes...

05:31.505 --> 05:33.681
They're running.
Luca, let's go.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.380
- Where's Betty?
- She's gone.

05:37.424 --> 05:38.686
No, that's impossible.

05:38.729 --> 05:40.818
Betty's tracker.

05:40.862 --> 05:42.864
They must've
ripped it out of her.

05:44.648 --> 05:47.216
20-David to Command.
The armored vehicle is gone.

05:47.259 --> 05:50.219
I repeat, Betty is gone.
We lost her.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.309
This was all just a setup
to get us inside

05:53.353 --> 05:55.485
- so they could take her.
- What the hell for?

05:55.529 --> 05:56.965
Hell if I know.

05:57.008 --> 05:59.271
But I got a bad feeling
we're about to find out.

06:38.441 --> 06:40.835
I've got a call
with the brass in five minutes,

06:40.878 --> 06:42.402
so does somebody want
to explain to me

06:42.445 --> 06:44.752
how the hell we lost a ten-ton
ARV in broad daylight?

06:44.795 --> 06:46.101
This is my fault, Commander.

06:46.144 --> 06:47.842
Just a second,
Luca, hold on.

06:47.885 --> 06:49.800
We're still working
on it, sir.

06:49.844 --> 06:51.193
Patrol witnessed
the four suspects

06:51.236 --> 06:52.499
emerge from the building
shortly after we entered,

06:52.542 --> 06:54.588
but they were wearing
SWAT uniforms.

06:54.631 --> 06:56.024
Patrol mistook them for us.

06:56.067 --> 06:57.373
It wasn't until
me and Hondo came out

06:57.417 --> 06:58.461
that they realized
something was up.

06:58.505 --> 06:59.636
By then,
Black Betty was gone.

06:59.680 --> 07:01.029
What about her tracker?

07:01.072 --> 07:02.465
They ripped it out
of her freaking dash.

07:02.509 --> 07:03.988
Look, it's not hard
to find if you know

07:04.032 --> 07:05.512
what you're looking for.
It would take seconds.

07:05.555 --> 07:07.339
Don't tell me you left
- the keys in it.
- No, sir.

07:07.383 --> 07:08.558
Betty was buttoned up.
I still got the key right here.

07:08.602 --> 07:09.907
They must've
had their own key.

07:09.951 --> 07:11.082
It's easy enough to clone

07:11.126 --> 07:12.562
if you can get close
to the original.

07:12.606 --> 07:14.608
So, just how and when could
they have done that?

07:14.651 --> 07:16.087
We don't know that, sir.

07:16.131 --> 07:17.698
Tan and Street are gonna
pore through the archives

07:17.741 --> 07:18.873
of Betty's dashcam footage.

07:18.916 --> 07:20.135
If someone ripped our key,

07:20.178 --> 07:21.484
maybe they got
caught in the act.

07:21.528 --> 07:23.704
So there's a team of
SWAT imposters out there

07:23.747 --> 07:25.140
with Black Betty,

07:25.183 --> 07:26.533
with her entire arsenal
at their disposal.

07:26.576 --> 07:28.448
So whatever they're planning
to do with her,

07:28.491 --> 07:31.059
it's gonna be damn near
impossible to stop 'em.

07:31.102 --> 07:33.975
And if there's a single
loss of life as a result...

07:35.977 --> 07:37.848
I'm the driver.
Betty's my girl.

07:37.892 --> 07:39.546
If anyone gets hurt,
that's on me.

07:39.589 --> 07:41.504
No, it's on all of
us to find Betty

07:41.548 --> 07:44.289
and to stop this crew before
anything like that can happen.

07:49.773 --> 07:51.775
Luca's really taking this hard.

07:51.819 --> 07:53.211
You surprised?

07:53.255 --> 07:54.952
When he was in Germany
and I was driving Betty,

07:54.996 --> 07:56.301
he called every day to check in.

07:56.345 --> 07:57.912
At first I thought
he was making sure

07:57.955 --> 08:00.131
I was doing all right,
but then eventually I realized

08:00.175 --> 08:01.872
he was more worried about Betty.

08:01.916 --> 08:03.395
Losing her has got to be
killing him.

08:03.439 --> 08:05.267
Well, Luca didn't lose
Black Betty.

08:05.310 --> 08:06.790
She was taken from all of us.

08:06.834 --> 08:08.488
Yeah, try telling him that.

08:08.531 --> 08:10.272
Yeah.

08:10.315 --> 08:11.447
Hold on.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.231
I think I might have something.

08:14.450 --> 08:15.756
Remember like two weeks ago

08:15.799 --> 08:18.106
we had that false alarm call
in Los Feliz?

08:18.149 --> 08:19.760
Yeah. Caller said
all the right words

08:19.803 --> 08:21.849
to get the SWAT response, but
when we got there, nothing.

08:21.892 --> 08:24.025
Just like the call
this morning.

08:24.068 --> 08:26.593
There's Luca.
We're Code 4.

08:26.636 --> 08:28.638
Yeah, look behind them.
Dude in the hoodie.

08:30.074 --> 08:31.206
What's he holding?

08:31.249 --> 08:32.599
Some sort of capture device.

08:32.642 --> 08:34.818
He's cloning the key
right behind Luca's back.

08:34.862 --> 08:37.342
Man, this is gonna
tip Luca over.

08:37.386 --> 08:38.953
Not if we find Black Betty.

08:38.996 --> 08:40.302
This guy was smart enough

08:40.345 --> 08:42.086
to keep his face turned
away from the dashcam.

08:42.130 --> 08:44.175
But that means he's facing
all those houses right there.

08:44.219 --> 08:45.916
If even one of them
has a security camera,

08:45.960 --> 08:47.309
they might've caught his face.

08:47.352 --> 08:48.571
I'll get Patrol out there
to start canvassing.

08:48.615 --> 08:49.833
All right.

08:49.877 --> 08:52.053
Hey.
Hey.

08:52.096 --> 08:53.402
Anything?
Uh...

08:53.445 --> 08:55.709
Potential Hail Mary.

08:55.752 --> 08:57.493
You okay?

08:58.625 --> 09:00.322
I left the envelope
in Black Betty.

09:00.365 --> 09:01.628
- Nichelle's envelope?
- Yeah.

09:01.671 --> 09:03.543
I didn't want to take it
with me on a call.

09:03.586 --> 09:05.980
I just-- I figured there'd
be nowhere safer.
Oh, damn.

09:06.023 --> 09:07.503
- Should we say something?
- I'd rather not.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.984
I promised Nichelle
it would be safe with us.

09:10.027 --> 09:11.899
Can you call
the doctor's office,

09:11.942 --> 09:14.075
explain the situation,
maybe someone there can help?

09:14.118 --> 09:15.903
- They're not gonna tell me.
- They might.

09:15.946 --> 09:18.775
Nichelle had them seal the
baby's gender in an envelope.

09:18.819 --> 09:21.386
They have to know it's for
a gender reveal of some kind.

09:21.430 --> 09:23.127
Okay, maybe.
But then I'd know.

09:23.171 --> 09:24.520
So what?

09:24.564 --> 09:25.739
All that matters

09:25.782 --> 09:27.567
is that Hondo and Nichelle
are surprised.

09:34.312 --> 09:36.750
So this is where
you've been hiding.

09:36.793 --> 09:38.273
You got a second?

09:38.316 --> 09:40.362
Yeah, I got
nowhere else to be.

09:40.405 --> 09:42.277
Look, if I'm honest,

09:42.320 --> 09:45.541
with Betty gone,
I'm not sure what to do.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.499
I know this is eating at you.

09:47.543 --> 09:49.545
And real talk, there's
nobody I'd rather have

09:49.589 --> 09:50.764
driving Black Betty than you.

09:50.807 --> 09:52.809
But, Luca, your value
to this team

09:52.853 --> 09:54.376
goes far beyond one skill.

09:54.419 --> 09:56.508
I should've been prepared
for something like this.
Hey!

09:56.552 --> 09:58.598
We train for every
possible scenario,

09:58.641 --> 10:01.209
and sometimes these guys
get one step ahead of us.

10:01.252 --> 10:03.211
So we just need to get
back out in front.

10:03.254 --> 10:04.647
That's it.

10:05.735 --> 10:07.563
I need to know
you're focused, Luca.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.565
Because when we find
these guys, and we will,

10:09.609 --> 10:11.436
we're gonna be going up
against our own weaponry.

10:11.480 --> 10:12.960
That is what I'm
focused on, okay?

10:13.003 --> 10:14.396
But I keep thinking,

10:14.439 --> 10:16.485
what if these guys
crash Betty into a car?

10:16.528 --> 10:19.314
Or a freaking farmers market?

10:19.357 --> 10:21.142
Somebody's gonna lose
their badge.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.450
There's no way I'm letting
- you guys take the hit.
- I really appreciate

10:25.494 --> 10:26.887
that you're willing
to fall on the sword,

10:26.930 --> 10:29.411
but I ain't accepting that,
you understand?

10:29.454 --> 10:32.762
I am squad leader.
The buck stops here.

10:33.850 --> 10:37.419
Now, if you have to,
take a minute.

10:37.462 --> 10:39.856
Then you get your head right.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.641
I need you sharp
when we find

10:41.684 --> 10:43.381
whoever thinks that
they can steal from 20-Squad

10:43.425 --> 10:45.645
and not pay a price.

10:48.778 --> 10:49.866
Yeah?

10:53.043 --> 10:55.176
- We got this.
- Okay.

10:58.962 --> 11:01.399
What's this about
a Hail Mary paying off?

11:01.443 --> 11:02.923
I had Patrol go door-to-door

11:02.966 --> 11:04.446
in the neighborhood where
Luca's key got cloned.

11:04.489 --> 11:06.230
Got lucky on a hit
from a Ring camera.

11:06.274 --> 11:07.275
Gave us this guy.

11:07.318 --> 11:08.580
Bryce McCabe, 32 years old.

11:08.624 --> 11:10.539
Army washout with
a dishonorable discharge.

11:10.582 --> 11:11.845
Same guy we caught

11:11.888 --> 11:14.586
on Betty's dashcam
cloning Luca's key.

11:15.587 --> 11:16.806
Well, he's no Boy Scout,

11:16.850 --> 11:18.634
but he's not exactly
a criminal mastermind.

11:18.678 --> 11:21.419
- Is that it?
- LKA is an apartment
in North Hollywood.

11:21.463 --> 11:22.638
I talked to the landlord.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.161
Said McCabe hasn't
been around for days.

11:24.205 --> 11:25.685
He's more than happy
to leave the keys for us.

11:25.728 --> 11:27.512
- Warrant?
- Already in the works.

11:27.556 --> 11:29.210
All right,
you two get out a BOLO.

11:29.253 --> 11:31.081
Deacon, grab Hondo
and see what you can find

11:31.125 --> 11:32.300
- at McCabe's apartment.
- I'm on it.

11:32.343 --> 11:33.475
Hey, we rolling out?

11:33.518 --> 11:34.824
Uh, just me and Hondo.

11:34.868 --> 11:36.652
Might have a lead
on the crew from this morning.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.132
All right, let me go, too,
if it has to do with Betty.

11:38.175 --> 11:39.655
No, Hondo and Deacon
can handle it.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.701
I still need an itemized list
from everything that was

11:41.744 --> 11:43.093
in that AV's cargo
this morning.

11:43.137 --> 11:44.355
And if any of it's used
in a crime...

11:44.399 --> 11:46.836
...it's gonna be evidence.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.098
Yeah.

11:48.142 --> 11:50.797
I understand.

11:57.804 --> 11:59.501
Bryce McCabe.

11:59.544 --> 12:01.633
LAPD with a warrant.
Open up.

12:03.418 --> 12:04.985
Hey, McCabe.
It's your last chance.

12:05.028 --> 12:06.247
We're coming in.

12:14.037 --> 12:15.952
Closet only. Clear.

12:17.780 --> 12:19.826
Give me two.

12:19.869 --> 12:20.914
Right side clear.

12:20.957 --> 12:22.176
Bathroom clear.

12:22.219 --> 12:23.612
Clear.

12:24.874 --> 12:27.311
There's three bedrolls.
Looks like McCabe was hosting.

12:27.355 --> 12:29.183
That's McCabe plus three.

12:29.226 --> 12:30.445
There's our crew
from this morning.

12:30.488 --> 12:32.447
Yeah, speaking of...
some blueprints

12:32.490 --> 12:34.014
from the office building
and some others.

12:34.057 --> 12:35.276
I don't know what they are.

12:35.319 --> 12:36.712
I'll send these to Tan,

12:36.756 --> 12:39.628
see if he can make
something of it.

12:40.934 --> 12:42.109
Deacon...

12:42.152 --> 12:43.719
Hey! This is Sergeant--
Flashbang!

12:43.763 --> 12:45.329
Cover, cover!

12:47.592 --> 12:48.942
Federal agents!

12:48.985 --> 12:50.160
Just say "Federal agents"?

12:50.204 --> 12:51.640
I don't know,
I couldn't make it out.

12:51.683 --> 12:54.034
This is LAPD SWAT!
Drop your weapons!

12:54.077 --> 12:55.600
Nice try, McCabe!

12:55.644 --> 12:57.820
Drop your weapons and come out
with your hands up!

12:57.864 --> 13:00.127
Yo, hold up.
- Identify yourselves!
- FBI!

13:00.170 --> 13:02.520
- Come out now!
- What are the Feds doing here?

13:02.564 --> 13:05.872
This is Sergeant
Daniel Harrelson, LAPD SWAT!

13:07.743 --> 13:09.919
Hondo? Is that you?

13:11.094 --> 13:14.010
I know you?
Don't you recognize my voice?

13:14.054 --> 13:16.056
It's kind of hard
with my ears ringing.

13:16.099 --> 13:18.536
It's your favorite
Internet model.

13:22.845 --> 13:24.716
Vasquez?

13:24.760 --> 13:27.676
Yeah.

13:27.719 --> 13:30.026
- Deacon, we're good.
- Code 4.

13:31.288 --> 13:33.595
Long time no see, Hondo.

13:33.638 --> 13:35.640
And you ain't lying.

13:35.684 --> 13:38.643
Deacon, you remember
Jackie Vasquez, don't you?

13:38.687 --> 13:39.906
We worked patrol together
almost a million years ago.

13:39.949 --> 13:41.603
Of course, it's nice
to see you again.

13:41.646 --> 13:43.083
- Good to see you.
- But, wait, hold on.
Internet model?

13:43.126 --> 13:46.129
LAPD put her diverse,
female face on their website

13:46.173 --> 13:47.435
to drive recruiting.

13:47.478 --> 13:49.567
Wasn't enough to keep me
around, though.

13:49.611 --> 13:51.439
Thanks, Ignacio.

13:51.482 --> 13:53.006
- You got it.
- Thanks.

13:53.049 --> 13:54.877
Sorry about the
rough entry, boys.

13:54.921 --> 13:56.313
No harm done.

13:56.357 --> 13:57.706
So, what gives?

13:57.749 --> 13:59.447
What's the Bureau's
interest in McCabe?

13:59.490 --> 14:01.666
You first.

14:02.624 --> 14:03.799
Well, McCabe
and his crew created

14:03.843 --> 14:05.148
a hostage situation
this morning

14:05.192 --> 14:06.889
in order to steal our ARV.

14:06.933 --> 14:11.111
I'm sorry, he-he stole
- the SWAT armored vehicle?
- Yeah.

14:11.154 --> 14:12.460
And everything in it.

14:12.503 --> 14:14.331
Any idea what he'd
want to use it for?

14:14.375 --> 14:15.942
Can't say, really.

14:15.985 --> 14:17.595
Can't say, or won't say?

14:17.639 --> 14:19.293
All right, come on, guys,
let's not play this game.

14:19.336 --> 14:21.948
You know I can't just read LAPD
into a federal investigation.

14:21.991 --> 14:25.429
Come on, Vasquez.
So don't read us. Use us.

14:25.473 --> 14:27.127
Nobody's better suited
to recover that vehicle

14:27.170 --> 14:28.563
than my team.

14:28.606 --> 14:31.218
Look, why don't you come back
to HQ with us?

14:31.261 --> 14:32.480
Put our heads together,
share intel.

14:32.523 --> 14:34.525
Come back to HQ?Yeah.

14:34.569 --> 14:36.310
Commander Hicks
still run the place?

14:36.353 --> 14:37.572
Yeah, he just wants
McCabe in custody

14:37.615 --> 14:39.095
and our vehicle recovered.
Same as you.

14:39.139 --> 14:42.316
Look, I'll admit, it's
impressive that you beat us here

14:42.359 --> 14:43.926
without knowing what I know...

14:46.189 --> 14:49.714
And I did always want
to ride with 20-Squad.

14:50.541 --> 14:52.369
Looks like today's
your lucky day.

15:01.726 --> 15:03.337
Jim Street, Victor Tan,

15:03.380 --> 15:05.643
meet Special Agent
Jackie Vasquez of the FBI.

15:05.687 --> 15:07.950
Hi.
- Nice to meet you.
- Former LAPD.

15:07.994 --> 15:09.691
In fact, she
and Hondo rode together

15:09.734 --> 15:11.127
in Hollywood Division
- back in the day.
- We're gonna want

15:11.171 --> 15:12.868
to hear some patrol days
stories about Hondo later.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.174
"Later" is right.

15:14.217 --> 15:15.566
For now, let's focus
on McCabe.

15:15.610 --> 15:17.438
Turns out he's been
on the FBI's radar

15:17.481 --> 15:19.222
since long before
he stole Black Betty.

15:19.266 --> 15:20.702
Unofficially,
as in

15:20.745 --> 15:21.964
"I will deny it
if it comes out,"

15:22.008 --> 15:23.879
McCabe is the key to
a RICO investigation

15:23.923 --> 15:26.882
I've been building over the last
two years on the Morelia cartel.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.188
My team raided
a stash house

15:28.231 --> 15:30.755
and confiscated over
$10 million of product

15:30.799 --> 15:32.583
that McCabe was
supposed to be guarding.

15:32.627 --> 15:34.498
McCabe wasn't there.
We haven't seen him since.

15:34.542 --> 15:36.587
Probably hiding from
you <i>and</i> the cartel

15:36.631 --> 15:38.024
if he lost ten mil
of their product.

15:38.067 --> 15:39.677
They're gonna
want payback.

15:39.721 --> 15:40.983
And stealing Black Betty's
got to be part of his plan

15:41.027 --> 15:42.593
to get back
some of his losses.

15:42.637 --> 15:44.204
And with a fully-stocked
armored vehicle,

15:44.247 --> 15:45.379
he's got a lot of options.

15:45.422 --> 15:47.207
Yeah, you've already got

15:47.250 --> 15:48.730
the, uh, plans and blueprints

15:48.773 --> 15:50.253
from McCabe's apartment.

15:50.297 --> 15:51.646
You able to make anything
of them?

15:51.689 --> 15:52.995
We confirmed that one set

15:53.039 --> 15:54.388
is of the office building
from this morning.

15:55.041 --> 15:56.564
Turns out the others
are vault designs

15:56.607 --> 15:58.261
commissioned by
Pacific Access Bank.

15:58.305 --> 16:01.177
Pacific Access has branches
all across Los Angeles.

16:01.221 --> 16:02.570
There's no way to monitor

16:02.613 --> 16:03.832
- all of 'em.
- I've already
got a call in

16:03.875 --> 16:05.138
to the bank's corporate
security office.

16:05.181 --> 16:06.748
Hopefully they can
narrow down the location

16:06.791 --> 16:08.445
of this
specific vault.

16:08.489 --> 16:10.491
Agent Vasquez,

16:10.534 --> 16:12.493
can I get a word in private?

16:19.848 --> 16:21.502
What was that look?

16:21.545 --> 16:23.243
Nah, there's just
a little bit of history

16:23.286 --> 16:24.505
between Hicks and Vasquez.

16:24.548 --> 16:26.202
All right.

16:26.246 --> 16:29.771
Like Hondo,
Vasquez was a top patrol cop.

16:29.814 --> 16:31.077
Number one
at everything.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.774
When Hondo applied for SWAT,
so did Vasquez,

16:32.817 --> 16:35.255
only her application
was denied by the panel.

16:35.298 --> 16:36.647
Didn't even get a look.

16:36.691 --> 16:38.171
- What'd she do wrong?
- Nothing.
But this was

16:38.214 --> 16:40.825
back before there were
any female officers on SWAT.

16:40.869 --> 16:43.611
Before Chris helped break
through that glass ceiling,

16:43.654 --> 16:45.221
a lot of good officers
got turned away.

16:45.265 --> 16:47.093
But what's this got
to do with Hicks?

16:47.136 --> 16:49.530
Hicks was on the panel
that denied her.

16:52.533 --> 16:54.230
Hondo was just getting
me up to speed,

16:54.274 --> 16:56.406
and I know you're
SWAT-rated with the Bureau.

16:56.450 --> 16:58.930
And as long as you're willing
to follow Hondo's lead,

16:58.974 --> 17:01.759
I see no reason to decline your
request to ride along today.

17:01.803 --> 17:03.500
- My request, Commander?
- Mm.

17:03.544 --> 17:05.154
It was actually Hondo
who suggested it.

17:05.198 --> 17:07.983
Regardless, it only benefits
McCabe if the LAPD

17:08.027 --> 17:10.594
and FBI get bogged down
in a jurisdictional sword fight.

17:10.638 --> 17:14.207
Yeah, I agree. A joint task
force serves both our interests.

17:14.250 --> 17:16.296
Okay, then. We're... good.

17:16.339 --> 17:18.080
No, we're not.

17:18.124 --> 17:19.342
Not yet.

17:20.169 --> 17:22.128
I need to clear the air
on something first.

17:22.171 --> 17:25.827
You know I was on the panel that
denied your application to SWAT.

17:25.870 --> 17:27.829
The vote was
two-to-one against you,

17:27.872 --> 17:30.614
and I'm sorry to say
I was in the majority.

17:30.658 --> 17:33.095
Least it wasn't a clean sweep.

17:33.139 --> 17:36.403
Yeah. Well, given enough
time to reflect on it,

17:36.446 --> 17:37.795
I made the wrong call.

17:37.839 --> 17:40.146
A lot's changed
around here since then.

17:40.189 --> 17:42.887
And, more than that,
I-I hope I have, too.

17:42.931 --> 17:45.151
If I had a chance
to do it again,

17:45.194 --> 17:48.328
I'd like to believe
I'd do it differently.

17:48.371 --> 17:51.244
Thank you for saying that, sir.

17:51.287 --> 17:53.289
- Yeah.
- If nothing else,

17:53.333 --> 17:55.987
got me to move on to bigger
and better things, right?

17:57.554 --> 17:59.687
Careful. You're
still in my house.

18:05.736 --> 18:07.347
- Hello?
- Hello, Sergeant Kay?

18:07.390 --> 18:08.652
Yeah, this is Sergeant Kay.

18:08.696 --> 18:10.828
Hey.

18:10.872 --> 18:12.961
Yeah, hi.
Thank you for calling me back.

18:13.004 --> 18:15.964
I'm-I'm not sure if my message
was-was clear earlier.

18:16.007 --> 18:19.359
Nichelle Carmichael gave me
an envelope earlier today

18:19.402 --> 18:21.100
after she had an appointment
with you guys.

18:21.143 --> 18:23.102
The gender, yes.
- I arranged that.
- Oh.

18:23.145 --> 18:25.060
Oh, good. So you're the one
that gave her the envelope.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.322
- That's right.
- Perfect.

18:26.366 --> 18:27.541
So you know
what I'm talking about.

18:27.584 --> 18:30.761
Um, the problem is...

18:30.805 --> 18:32.633
- the envelope disappeared.
- Oh, no.

18:32.676 --> 18:34.896
Yeah. Um, and-and my wife

18:34.939 --> 18:36.898
is in charge
of the gender reveal party.

18:36.941 --> 18:38.900
And without knowing
what is inside the envelope,

18:38.943 --> 18:40.510
she doesn't know
what color cake to bake.

18:40.554 --> 18:43.426
I see. If you promise not to
mention my name, I can tell you.

18:43.470 --> 18:44.906
Yeah. Yes, yes.

18:44.949 --> 18:47.517
Y-Your secret is completely safe
with me.

18:47.561 --> 18:49.389
- A-And my wife.
- Okay...

18:49.432 --> 18:50.912
Hello?

18:50.955 --> 18:53.132
I-I lost you for a second.

18:54.307 --> 18:55.612
- Okay.
- It's a girl.

18:55.656 --> 18:57.223
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:57.266 --> 18:58.398
Oh, that's amazing.

18:58.441 --> 19:00.182
Thank you. All right.

19:00.226 --> 19:01.662
Did she just
say "girl"?

19:01.705 --> 19:03.446
I just-- I thought
I heard her say

19:03.490 --> 19:05.100
- they're having a girl.
- Hey, you were not supposed
to hear that.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.536
Hey, Stevens, you didn't
hear anything either,

19:06.580 --> 19:07.711
you understand?

19:07.755 --> 19:09.974
I didn't hear nothing
about a girl.

19:10.932 --> 19:12.412
Great. Thanks, Street.

19:12.455 --> 19:14.936
I'm sorry, man, I-I
didn't mean to eavesdrop.

19:14.979 --> 19:16.285
What's the big deal anyway?

19:16.329 --> 19:17.939
Oh, come on, it's this place.
It's the hive mind.

19:17.982 --> 19:19.593
One cop knows something,
then they all know it.

19:19.636 --> 19:22.509
How long do you think it takes
before someone goes up to Hondo

19:22.552 --> 19:24.119
and just says something?
News like this

19:24.163 --> 19:26.077
is not gonna wait
until the weekend.

19:26.121 --> 19:27.775
Okay. So how fast
can Annie bake a cake?

19:27.818 --> 19:28.776
She's back
in law school.

19:28.819 --> 19:30.560
She's in class all day.

19:30.604 --> 19:31.996
So what are we gonna do?

19:38.655 --> 19:39.656
Hey, Commander.

19:40.701 --> 19:43.007
I just heard back from
the corporate security office

19:43.051 --> 19:44.487
for Pacific
Access Bank.

19:44.531 --> 19:46.010
The vault plans we found--
that particular vault

19:46.054 --> 19:47.577
is unique
to just three branches.

19:47.621 --> 19:49.449
Two in San Diego
and one here in L.A.

19:49.492 --> 19:50.537
In Silver Lake.

19:50.580 --> 19:52.147
That's got to be
McCabe's target.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.236
50-Squad's handling a barricade
out in Westchester.

19:54.280 --> 19:55.455
20-Squad's up.

19:55.498 --> 19:56.760
You tell Hondo and get
your asses over there.

19:56.804 --> 19:58.414
Yes, sir.

20:15.649 --> 20:17.172
This is LAPD SWAT!

20:17.216 --> 20:20.131
There's been a bomb threat
called into this location!

20:20.175 --> 20:22.656
We need everyone to file out
in an orderly fashion!

20:22.699 --> 20:24.092
- You the manager?
- Yeah.

20:24.135 --> 20:25.659
You really think
this is real?

20:25.702 --> 20:28.139
Hopefully not, but we need to
clear the building to find out.

20:28.183 --> 20:29.532
- Is there a key to the back?
- Yeah.

20:29.576 --> 20:31.404
Thank you.
Go keep your people calm

20:31.447 --> 20:33.971
and wait till we give you
- the all clear.
- Okay.

20:34.015 --> 20:36.060
Need you to
move outside!

20:37.061 --> 20:39.238
Clear the building!
Let's go!

20:56.603 --> 20:58.257
LAPD SWAT!

20:59.040 --> 21:00.911
Move away from the vehicle!

21:07.135 --> 21:09.355
- Don't do it, McCabe!
- Cover!

21:09.398 --> 21:10.399
Cover!

21:13.359 --> 21:15.839
- Vasquez, move! Move!
- Moving!

21:18.538 --> 21:20.235
Get suppressing fire
on that hatch!

21:20.279 --> 21:21.149
Tan, Street,

21:21.192 --> 21:22.585
get those people out of here!

21:22.629 --> 21:24.413
- Let's go! Move!
- Let's move! Let's move!

21:24.457 --> 21:26.067
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Let's go! Let's go!

21:26.110 --> 21:27.677
- Let's go!
- Move, move, move, move!

21:27.721 --> 21:29.418
Come on!
Go! Go!

21:30.506 --> 21:32.421
26-David, civilians are secure!

21:32.465 --> 21:34.902
These rounds aren't gonna cut it
against Betty's armor!

21:34.945 --> 21:36.730
Okay, just keep him busy!
I'll try to flank him,

21:36.773 --> 21:38.122
get a better angle!

21:47.871 --> 21:49.960
More suspects heading out!

21:51.875 --> 21:53.486
Deacon, cover fire!

21:54.791 --> 21:56.227
Vasquez, on me!

22:03.278 --> 22:05.236
Forget him.
We're out of here. Let's go!

22:05.280 --> 22:07.543
20-David to Command.
One gunman down.

22:07.587 --> 22:08.892
Street, Tan, move in!

22:11.025 --> 22:12.113
They're gonna break
for it.

22:12.156 --> 22:14.463
Luca, be ready to pursue!

22:15.856 --> 22:17.597
Don't move!
Hands behind your back!

22:17.640 --> 22:18.859
30-David,

22:18.902 --> 22:20.426
Betty's on
the move.

22:22.428 --> 22:24.125
Hey!

22:24.168 --> 22:25.996
Get out of the way!

22:26.780 --> 22:27.650
Vasquez!

22:28.912 --> 22:30.697
What are you doing?!
Clear out! Move!

22:30.740 --> 22:31.785
I'm sorry, Hondo.

22:31.828 --> 22:33.134
Come on! They're getting away!

22:33.177 --> 22:34.440
What the hell, Vasquez?

22:34.483 --> 22:35.484
I had no choice.

22:35.528 --> 22:37.356
You don't understand
what's going on.

22:38.487 --> 22:40.141
You let them escape?

22:46.277 --> 22:47.757
And to think I apologized
to you for making a mistake

22:47.801 --> 22:49.542
by dumping
your SWAT application.

22:49.585 --> 22:52.545
The only mistake I made
was thinking you were fit

22:52.588 --> 22:53.981
to ride with 20-Squad today.

22:54.024 --> 22:57.071
I don't know what passes
for police work at the FBI,

22:57.114 --> 22:58.638
but that doesn't fly here.

22:58.681 --> 22:59.856
And whatever chaos

22:59.900 --> 23:01.467
McCabe stirs up going forward,

23:01.510 --> 23:02.772
that's on you.

23:02.816 --> 23:04.078
All of it.

23:04.121 --> 23:05.819
Don't look at me
for support.

23:05.862 --> 23:07.168
You put my entire team
at risk.

23:07.211 --> 23:08.387
You played me, Vasquez.

23:08.430 --> 23:10.171
She played all
of us, it seems.

23:10.214 --> 23:12.652
I just got off the phone
with my counterpart at the FBI.

23:12.695 --> 23:14.044
He told me there's no RICO case

23:14.088 --> 23:15.568
being built against
the Morelia cartel.

23:15.611 --> 23:17.831
Just what the hell
are you and McCabe up to?

23:17.874 --> 23:19.354
Come on, Hondo, man.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.443
It's not like that. I need
you to trust me on this.

23:21.487 --> 23:23.184
Trust just went out the window!

23:23.227 --> 23:25.186
No more classified excuses!

23:25.229 --> 23:26.579
No more stalling!

23:26.622 --> 23:30.409
You need to come clean,
Vasquez, and now.

23:33.412 --> 23:36.197
You know the name Gustaf Varner?

23:38.417 --> 23:39.722
You should.

23:39.766 --> 23:41.768
He masterminded
the Villatoma bombing in Spain

23:41.811 --> 23:43.857
three years ago. He's also
a suspect in bombings

23:43.900 --> 23:45.467
in Greece and Estonia.

23:45.511 --> 23:47.817
Hold up. Islamic State was
behind the Villatoma bombing.

23:47.861 --> 23:49.993
No. ISIS took credit,

23:50.037 --> 23:51.778
and Interpol
didn't contradict the claim

23:51.821 --> 23:54.041
because they royally messed
up with Gustaf Varner.

23:54.084 --> 23:55.869
They had a tip that
he was gonna detonate

23:55.912 --> 23:57.436
the bomb, and
they didn't act.

23:57.479 --> 23:59.176
What does any of that
have to do with today?

23:59.220 --> 24:02.223
Gustaf Varner has been
targeting NATO countries,

24:02.266 --> 24:05.139
and my belief is that
he is here, in L.A.,

24:05.182 --> 24:06.619
planning something,

24:06.662 --> 24:08.098
something disastrous,

24:08.142 --> 24:09.535
maybe worse
than Villatoma.

24:09.578 --> 24:10.710
Your belief?

24:10.753 --> 24:12.625
As in the FBI doesn't
agree with you?

24:12.668 --> 24:15.932
I am not running
a rogue operation, Commander.

24:15.976 --> 24:17.064
But my supervisors

24:17.107 --> 24:19.153
have competing theories,
and none

24:19.196 --> 24:21.721
will pass my threat
assessment up to the SAC.

24:21.764 --> 24:26.029
I guess the LAPD isn't the only
agency to undervalue its women.

24:26.073 --> 24:29.642
But I am right.
And McCabe is the key.

24:29.685 --> 24:31.818
You don't know the details of
McCabe's dishonorable discharge.

24:31.861 --> 24:33.341
I do.

24:34.211 --> 24:35.735
Army booted him
for losing munitions

24:35.778 --> 24:37.040
from a base in Germany.

24:37.084 --> 24:38.433
Some of those lost munitions

24:38.477 --> 24:40.566
were used
in the Villatoma bombing.

24:40.609 --> 24:43.264
So you're saying
- McCabe worked with Varner?
- Still does.

24:43.307 --> 24:44.918
My team ran down
a list of customers

24:44.961 --> 24:46.223
of the bank McCabe just hit.

24:46.267 --> 24:48.487
A safe-deposit box there
belongs to one

24:48.530 --> 24:50.445
of Varner's
associates,

24:50.489 --> 24:52.578
another bomb builder that ICE
busted trying to enter the U.S.

24:52.621 --> 24:53.970
six weeks ago.

24:54.014 --> 24:56.059
All right,
let's say you're right

24:56.103 --> 24:57.452
and Varner is here in L.A.

24:57.496 --> 25:00.107
We could've grabbed McCabe,
flipped him,

25:00.150 --> 25:01.935
and found Varner
- that way.
- No.

25:01.978 --> 25:03.937
Varner is way too cautious.

25:03.980 --> 25:05.939
He's-he's paranoid, even.

25:05.982 --> 25:09.116
If we brought McCabe in, Varner
would know and he would vanish.

25:09.159 --> 25:11.161
There'd be no sign
of him until some...

25:11.205 --> 25:13.947
packed stadium
or office building

25:13.990 --> 25:15.949
- is leveled.
- So you let him go.

25:15.992 --> 25:17.428
Allowing him to deliver

25:17.472 --> 25:19.039
whatever it is Varner
wanted from the bank.

25:19.082 --> 25:22.042
Which means that we need
to stop BS'ing here

25:22.085 --> 25:23.522
and find out where
they're meeting.

25:23.565 --> 25:25.262
And how do you propose
we do that?

25:26.089 --> 25:27.787
We got one of McCabe's
men in custody.

25:27.830 --> 25:29.310
There's
no "we."

25:29.353 --> 25:31.486
<i>I've</i> got one of McCabe's men
in custody.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.619
Let me talk to him.[scoffs]: Oh.

25:35.185 --> 25:36.665
Not a chance.

25:37.927 --> 25:40.190
Commander...

25:41.191 --> 25:42.323
What's done is done.

25:42.366 --> 25:43.324
And I am not happy

25:43.367 --> 25:45.065
- about it either.
- But...

25:45.108 --> 25:46.675
we don't have her intel.

25:47.720 --> 25:49.156
So maybe we should let this
play out

25:49.199 --> 25:51.071
if we want to take down
Varner and McCabe

25:51.114 --> 25:52.551
and get our ride back.

25:59.688 --> 26:00.776
I'm Commander Hicks.

26:00.820 --> 26:03.605
This is Special
Agent Vasquez, FBI.

26:04.475 --> 26:06.173
What's the FBI want with me?

26:06.216 --> 26:07.566
Thanks to your pal McCabe,

26:07.609 --> 26:09.742
you just landed on
our Most Wanted list.

26:09.785 --> 26:11.221
The hell for?

26:11.265 --> 26:13.833
We hit one box. Nothing we took
was FDIC-insured,

26:13.876 --> 26:15.530
so there's no federal beef.

26:15.574 --> 26:16.444
Look at you,

26:16.487 --> 26:18.228
another Internet legal genius.

26:18.272 --> 26:19.534
Judge is gonna love you.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.841
That's if he ever sees
a judge. More likely,

26:21.884 --> 26:25.366
I just Patriot Act his ass to a
prison no one even knows exists.

26:25.409 --> 26:27.194
Oh,
I-I'm guessing

26:27.237 --> 26:28.456
McCabe never bothered to mention

26:28.499 --> 26:30.458
that you were working
for a terrorist?

26:30.501 --> 26:32.199
Terrorist?

26:32.242 --> 26:33.722
What are you talking about?

26:35.115 --> 26:36.290
Gustaf Varner.

26:36.333 --> 26:37.552
He paid your
crew to hit

26:37.596 --> 26:39.380
that safe-deposit
box today.

26:39.423 --> 26:41.991
Stealing contraband and
delivering it to a bomb maker--

26:42.035 --> 26:43.906
hello, federal pen.

26:43.950 --> 26:45.038
I run scores. That's it.

26:45.081 --> 26:46.430
Mm.

26:46.474 --> 26:47.562
I would never work
for a terrorist.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.346
Financials say otherwise.

26:49.390 --> 26:50.565
McCabe has been
getting wire transfers

26:50.609 --> 26:52.654
from Varner for
the past six months,

26:52.698 --> 26:54.613
of which you've
been getting a cut.

26:55.657 --> 26:57.050
That's right, Jones.

26:57.093 --> 27:00.706
I got a paper trail
from Varner to McCabe to you.

27:01.881 --> 27:03.534
Cue it up.

27:07.190 --> 27:09.279
This is Varner's
handiwork.

27:10.890 --> 27:13.109
This is what
he's capable of.

27:13.153 --> 27:14.720
It's what
he's planning to do.

27:14.763 --> 27:17.461
Most likely right
here, in our city.

27:19.202 --> 27:20.334
I read your file,

27:20.377 --> 27:21.944
I've seen your
social media,

27:21.988 --> 27:24.207
and you got some pretty
hard-core views, but...

27:24.251 --> 27:27.689
nothing that doesn't fall
under the banner of patriotism.

27:28.690 --> 27:31.911
Look at me.

27:31.954 --> 27:33.826
But this?

27:33.869 --> 27:35.001
Come on.

27:35.044 --> 27:37.394
You can't be
okay with this.

27:43.270 --> 27:46.229
Even if I wanted to help,

27:46.273 --> 27:48.492
I've only ever dealt
with McCabe.

27:48.536 --> 27:50.190
I don't know anything
about Varner.

27:50.233 --> 27:52.322
What was in the
box you stole?

27:52.366 --> 27:54.194
- McCabe never said.
- Where were you gonna

27:54.237 --> 27:55.848
deliver it after
you left the bank?

27:55.891 --> 27:57.632
I don't know the location.

27:57.676 --> 28:00.461
Only that we were supposed
to deliver the box

28:00.504 --> 28:02.855
and the armored vehicle
somewhere later today.

28:02.898 --> 28:04.291
The box and our vehicle.

28:04.334 --> 28:06.075
So, McCabe didn't ditch it?

28:06.119 --> 28:07.642
I mean, that vehicle
isn't subtle.

28:07.686 --> 28:10.340
How did you manage to duck
our BOLO all day?

28:10.384 --> 28:11.733
Semitruck.

28:11.777 --> 28:14.605
We moved it around in the back
of an 18-wheeler.

28:16.564 --> 28:19.915
So, where exactly do we find
this 18-wheeler of yours?

28:25.181 --> 28:26.356
Hey.

28:26.400 --> 28:28.358
Can't believe
Vasquez is still here,

28:28.402 --> 28:30.143
that Hicks
didn't toss her out.

28:30.186 --> 28:31.666
Betty'd be parked

28:31.710 --> 28:34.060
in the motor pool right now
if she hadn't got in my way.

28:34.103 --> 28:37.803
I wish I could say I had better
news for you, but I don't.

28:38.934 --> 28:43.591
We think the guy
McCabe's working for...

28:43.634 --> 28:46.812
he's planning to use Black Betty
in some kind of bombing attack.

28:49.640 --> 28:51.338
Look, you all can tell me
a hundred times

28:51.381 --> 28:53.993
that Betty being taken
wasn't my fault.

28:54.036 --> 28:56.517
But if something
like that happens,

28:56.560 --> 28:58.867
no way I'll ever forgive myself.

29:02.001 --> 29:05.787
You know, when I started
evaluating SWAT recruits,

29:05.831 --> 29:08.834
I got everyone's scores
on file,

29:08.877 --> 29:12.185
including my dad
and my grandfather's.

29:12.228 --> 29:15.231
I needed to know
how I measured up.

29:15.275 --> 29:19.192
There was exactly one metric
where I outscored both of them.

29:19.235 --> 29:20.628
Let me guess--
driving proficiency.

29:20.671 --> 29:22.761
Which is why I need
to be behind the wheel.

29:22.804 --> 29:24.763
It's the only way that I know
I'm doing right

29:24.806 --> 29:26.068
by the Luca name.

29:26.112 --> 29:27.374
It's where I belong.

29:28.897 --> 29:30.899
I guess it's just my thing,
you know? I...Dude.

29:31.770 --> 29:35.512
You have taught me so much

29:35.556 --> 29:37.688
about how to do this job
the right way.

29:37.732 --> 29:40.082
And literally none of it
has been about driving.

29:40.126 --> 29:42.868
Not just how we do this job

29:42.911 --> 29:44.783
but why.

29:45.653 --> 29:47.568
You're the heart
of this team, Luca,

29:47.611 --> 29:49.788
not its wheelman.

29:50.658 --> 29:52.791
Not just its wheelman.

29:53.879 --> 29:56.272
Hey. Air 17's tracking
a semitrailer

29:56.316 --> 29:57.665
we think is
carrying Betty,

29:57.708 --> 29:59.014
which means McCabe's
on his way to the meet.

29:59.058 --> 30:00.842
We're rolling
- in five.
- Let's go get her back.

30:00.886 --> 30:01.930
Way ahead of you.

30:23.125 --> 30:25.954
Look at that.

30:27.303 --> 30:29.653
You were not exaggerating.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.918
She'll carry
the payload you described.

30:32.961 --> 30:34.267
I'd recommend
you stay off the roads

30:34.310 --> 30:35.659
for a while.

30:35.703 --> 30:37.923
Yeah, I don't plan on
taking it for a joyride.

30:37.966 --> 30:39.185
The police can collect

30:39.228 --> 30:40.926
what's left.

30:40.969 --> 30:43.058
You have the box?

30:52.589 --> 30:54.853
I assume the cargo
is undisturbed.

30:58.465 --> 31:00.728
McCABE:
Is that what I think it is?

31:00.771 --> 31:03.035
You had me moving yellowcake
uranium, and you didn't tell me?

31:03.078 --> 31:04.863
It's quite harmless
at this stage.

31:04.906 --> 31:06.560
It's only half
the cosmic radiation you get

31:06.603 --> 31:07.909
from a commercial flight.

31:07.953 --> 31:09.737
Once I complete
the milling process

31:09.780 --> 31:11.826
and rig it to my explosives...

31:11.870 --> 31:13.349
different story.

31:14.133 --> 31:17.005
The devastation
will be substantial.

31:17.049 --> 31:19.312
Just remember, you said
you'd give me warning,

31:19.355 --> 31:20.661
so me and my guys are not
in the area.

31:20.704 --> 31:23.229
I'll tell you when we're ready,

31:23.272 --> 31:25.274
but I would avoid downtown tonight.

31:25.318 --> 31:27.059
Okay,
let's load it up.

31:39.680 --> 31:41.073
Kill them.

31:51.910 --> 31:54.695
LAPD! Drop your weapons
on the ground now!

32:09.014 --> 32:10.711
That's him!
That's Varner!

32:11.668 --> 32:14.584
20-David to Command.
Gustaf Varner is on-site.

32:22.505 --> 32:23.767
Move.

32:32.080 --> 32:33.603
Drop the gun!
You're not gonna make it!

32:36.084 --> 32:37.607
Go around.

32:37.651 --> 32:39.087
Get back!

32:41.307 --> 32:42.961
We need to go.

32:45.050 --> 32:46.616
Cover us!

32:46.660 --> 32:48.009
Move up, move up!

33:04.112 --> 33:07.202
22-David,
Varner's going for Betty!

33:07.246 --> 33:09.161
Can't let him start that engine.

33:10.336 --> 33:11.946
Don't move!
Hands off the weapon.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.817
On your stomach.

33:17.821 --> 33:19.127
Get us out of here.

33:22.043 --> 33:23.088
Don't move!

33:23.131 --> 33:24.089
Hands behind your head.

33:24.132 --> 33:25.655
Give me your hands.

33:25.699 --> 33:28.136
30-David,
second suspect in custody.

33:31.531 --> 33:33.141
20-Squad, get to cover.

33:33.185 --> 33:34.490
Betty is on the move.

33:42.368 --> 33:44.109
20-David to Command.
Varner is

33:44.152 --> 33:45.414
inside Black Betty.

33:45.458 --> 33:47.590
We're about to lose control
of the perimeter.

33:47.634 --> 33:48.635
We need backup
to create roadblocks!

33:48.678 --> 33:49.897
We can't let Varner get away!

33:49.940 --> 33:51.116
Betty will rip
right through 'em.

33:51.159 --> 33:52.769
Luca, we got to move!

33:52.813 --> 33:55.511
Get to cover!
What?

33:56.512 --> 33:57.905
I'm ending this.

34:06.653 --> 34:10.178
- The armor's too thick, man.
- Not for armor-piercing bullets.

34:12.876 --> 34:14.878
Sorry about this, Betty.

34:26.020 --> 34:27.369
Vasquez, move, move! Move in!

34:31.460 --> 34:33.854
On the ground!

34:39.686 --> 34:40.904
Federal agent.
You are under arrest.

34:40.948 --> 34:42.863
You're done, McCabe.

34:42.906 --> 34:44.256
20-David,

34:44.299 --> 34:46.562
suspect's in custody,
we are Code 4.

34:46.606 --> 34:48.782
Betty is secure.

35:07.366 --> 35:09.542
Commander Hicks, I'm headed out.

35:09.585 --> 35:11.761
It was quite a day.

35:11.805 --> 35:14.155
It had its ups and its downs,
that's for sure.

35:14.199 --> 35:15.330
Yeah.

35:15.374 --> 35:16.940
I just got off a call
with the chief.

35:16.984 --> 35:19.204
It seems that the, uh, Bureau

35:19.247 --> 35:20.640
is crediting
Gustaf Varner's arrest

35:20.683 --> 35:22.555
to the LAPD

35:22.598 --> 35:24.383
and will "not
confirm or deny"

35:24.426 --> 35:26.515
any FBI involvement. Hmm.

35:26.559 --> 35:27.995
What do you know?

35:28.038 --> 35:30.171
I guess, for once,
they bothered to read my report.

35:30.215 --> 35:31.694
Yeah.

35:31.738 --> 35:33.914
You know,
Varner's a big collar.

35:33.957 --> 35:36.743
That's a career-making bust.

35:36.786 --> 35:38.571
You sure you want to pass
on that credit?

35:39.398 --> 35:41.400
It's not about the credit
for me, Commander.

35:41.443 --> 35:42.401
Never has been.

35:42.444 --> 35:43.402
Hmm.

35:43.445 --> 35:45.186
In the Bureau

35:45.230 --> 35:46.318
or back in my LAPD days,

35:46.361 --> 35:48.146
I just wanted
to make a difference.

35:48.189 --> 35:51.279
The problem is, as much as
we'd like to think otherwise,

35:51.323 --> 35:53.325
our line of work
is still a boys' club,

35:53.368 --> 35:55.240
which makes my job

35:55.283 --> 35:57.242
just a little bit harder.

35:58.678 --> 36:00.810
I'm sorry
I didn't come straight

36:00.854 --> 36:02.943
with you and Hondo sooner
in this whole thing,

36:02.986 --> 36:06.164
but given our history... No, no. I get you.

36:06.207 --> 36:09.341
I'm not gonna presume to know
your struggles, Vasquez.

36:09.384 --> 36:14.128
But to whatever extent I
contributed to them, I'm sorry.

36:14.172 --> 36:16.391
But you're a hell of an agent,

36:16.435 --> 36:19.438
a credit to the Bureau.

36:19.481 --> 36:22.745
You be careful
you don't throw that away.

36:28.577 --> 36:30.840
See you at the match,
dude. Yeah. Yeah.

36:32.842 --> 36:33.930
How bad's the damage?

36:33.974 --> 36:35.410
Cracked the engine block
in half,

36:35.454 --> 36:36.977
punctured the tranny,
and the whole drivetrain's

36:37.020 --> 36:39.197
a complete scrap job.

36:39.240 --> 36:41.024
Well,
then why are you smiling?

36:41.068 --> 36:42.983
'Cause I just got off the phone
with my boys

36:43.026 --> 36:44.419
at the police garage.

36:44.463 --> 36:46.160
They got a line
on a replacement engine,

36:46.204 --> 36:49.642
60 more horses than
the engine I just destroyed.

36:49.685 --> 36:52.122
They're gonna mate it with
a new nine-speed transmission.

36:52.166 --> 36:53.820
Betty's gonna be back
running faster

36:53.863 --> 36:55.648
and smoother than ever.

36:55.691 --> 36:57.171
- That's awesome, Luca.
- Yeah.

36:57.215 --> 36:58.477
Just promise me

36:58.520 --> 36:59.826
you didn't know that

36:59.869 --> 37:00.740
when you took those shots
and put her down.

37:00.783 --> 37:02.132
What? N-No way, dude.

37:02.176 --> 37:03.569
I loved the old Black Betty.

37:03.612 --> 37:06.659
Just gonna love this version
a little bit more.

37:06.702 --> 37:08.313
So, uh...

37:08.356 --> 37:09.705
before they haul her away,

37:09.749 --> 37:10.837
you think she's got

37:10.880 --> 37:12.404
one more mission in her?

37:18.758 --> 37:21.021
Hey, Hondo.

37:21.064 --> 37:22.675
I didn't want to leave
without saying goodbye.

37:22.718 --> 37:24.198
You calling it quits
for the day?

37:24.242 --> 37:27.810
Hardly. My bosses want
a full debriefing tonight.

37:27.854 --> 37:29.116
Hmm.

37:29.159 --> 37:31.031
Look, I already
apologized to Hicks.

37:31.074 --> 37:32.511
I want to do the same to you.

37:32.554 --> 37:34.034
I am sorry

37:34.077 --> 37:36.732
that I didn't trust you enough
not to lie to you.

37:38.038 --> 37:40.910
You remember when
we graduated from the academy?

37:40.954 --> 37:42.695
Only a handful of women
and people of color.

37:42.738 --> 37:44.523
We all used to say

37:44.566 --> 37:46.307
that we were never gonna let
how anyone else saw us

37:46.351 --> 37:47.743
affect the way we saw ourselves

37:47.787 --> 37:49.571
or...

37:49.615 --> 37:51.356
- how we did this job.
- Mm-hmm.

37:51.399 --> 37:54.576
Yeah. That's a lot easier
said than done.

37:54.620 --> 37:56.361
Don't we both know it.

37:56.404 --> 37:59.102
I really envy
what you've built here,

37:59.146 --> 38:01.540
the team you put together.

38:01.583 --> 38:04.064
And if I'm being honest,
it makes me a little sad

38:04.107 --> 38:05.892
that I was kept
from being a part of it.

38:05.935 --> 38:07.546
Yeah, I know.

38:07.589 --> 38:09.983
I hated how that went down.

38:10.026 --> 38:11.898
But, Jackie,

38:11.941 --> 38:14.074
you would've been
a great SWAT officer.

38:14.117 --> 38:16.032
You <i>are</i> a great SWAT officer,

38:16.076 --> 38:18.296
you're just wearing
a different uniform.

38:19.122 --> 38:20.994
You know, it's probably lucky
for me, too, anyway

38:21.037 --> 38:22.474
'cause if you were here at SWAT,

38:22.517 --> 38:25.259
I got a feeling you might be
coming after my job.

38:25.303 --> 38:27.348
Yeah.

38:27.392 --> 38:30.395
No, no, Hondo, man.
There's no replacing you.

38:30.438 --> 38:33.267
But thank you for letting
me ride with you today,

38:33.311 --> 38:37.271
'cause I can finally cross it
off my bucket list, so...

38:37.315 --> 38:40.230
Come on. I'll walk you out.

38:40.274 --> 38:41.884
All right.

38:46.541 --> 38:48.021
Vasquez,

38:48.064 --> 38:50.328
if you ever want to come back
and ride with us,

38:50.371 --> 38:51.938
door's open.

38:51.981 --> 38:54.549
- Thanks, Hondo.
- Mm-hmm.

38:57.422 --> 38:58.901
Be great, Jackie.

39:16.179 --> 39:17.137
Hey.

39:17.180 --> 39:19.269
Nichelle,
what are you doing here?

39:19.313 --> 39:21.837
What do you mean?
I got your message.

39:21.881 --> 39:23.186
Baby, I know it's been
a long day,

39:23.230 --> 39:24.840
but I would know
if I'd left you a message.

39:24.884 --> 39:27.669
No, no!

39:27.713 --> 39:29.541
You got to be kidding me, man!

39:29.584 --> 39:31.325
Luca, what's going on?

39:31.369 --> 39:32.674
I thought this saga
had a happy ending

39:32.718 --> 39:33.980
with a new engine and all.

39:34.023 --> 39:35.198
Look, the engine's not
the problem now.

39:35.242 --> 39:36.635
Look at what those bastards did

39:36.678 --> 39:38.767
to the inside of
this thing, man.

39:38.811 --> 39:40.247
What are you talking about?

39:43.729 --> 39:46.471
Congratulations,
it's a baby girl, baby!

39:52.912 --> 39:55.305
Wait, a-a girl?
Are you kidding me?

39:55.349 --> 39:57.133
- Nichelle, is this real?
- I didn't know anything about it.

39:57.177 --> 39:58.657
I mean, not this.

39:58.700 --> 40:00.267
Yeah, I know, I-I got
to come clean about something.

40:00.310 --> 40:02.182
Um, Nichelle,
earlier this morning

40:02.225 --> 40:03.879
you put me in charge
of some very precious cargo

40:03.923 --> 40:05.620
and it got misplaced.

40:05.664 --> 40:07.361
So we had to call

40:07.405 --> 40:08.449
an audible.

40:08.493 --> 40:09.624
Congratulations!

40:10.973 --> 40:12.975
Nichelle,
w-we're having a girl.

40:13.019 --> 40:14.890
Mmm!

40:15.978 --> 40:18.024
You're gonna have
a little baby daughter.

40:18.067 --> 40:19.460
How does that make you feel?

40:20.548 --> 40:22.637
I don't know.
Uh... overwhelmed.

40:22.681 --> 40:25.205
I mean, I know that
I love you so much. Mmm.

40:25.248 --> 40:26.772
Hell yeah, Hondo.

40:26.815 --> 40:28.991
♪GirlDad!

40:29.035 --> 40:30.340
Let's go!

40:30.384 --> 40:31.864
So happy for you, man.

40:31.907 --> 40:33.474
- We're having a girl!
- Yeah, baby!

40:33.518 --> 40:35.911
We're having a girl! Wow!

40:35.955 --> 40:37.391
Yeah!

40:37.435 --> 40:40.350
Oh, this is crazy.
This is so crazy.
