(latch rattling)

00:44.078 --> 00:44.877
(muffled screaming)

00:44.979 --> 00:45.744
No!

00:52.086 --> 00:52.918
(locks and metal
        door clattering)

00:57.058 --> 00:58.457

01:32.026 --> 01:33.826
(footsteps)

01:33.928 --> 01:36.161
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.

01:36.263 --> 01:37.062
I'm so sorry.

01:37.164 --> 01:38.063
I'm late!

01:38.165 --> 01:39.164
Sorry!

01:45.005 --> 01:46.939
Oh crap!

01:47.041 --> 01:48.373
(gasps) Oh my God!

01:48.476 --> 01:49.308
Eric, what are you doing?

01:49.410 --> 01:50.809
You scared me half to death!

01:50.911 --> 01:52.478
- Sorry, I didn't mean to.

01:52.580 --> 01:53.779
I knew you had this class next

01:53.881 --> 01:55.013
and I saw you running outside.

01:55.116 --> 01:56.982
I kind of figured you
     weren't gonna make it.

01:57.084 --> 01:59.651
Did Professor Meador
       lock you out again?

01:59.753 --> 02:00.552
- Yeah.

02:00.654 --> 02:01.587
I got caught up writing.

02:02.756 --> 02:04.022
So, what's up?

02:04.125 --> 02:05.624
Your classes are all the
  way across campus right now.

02:05.726 --> 02:08.693
- Yeah, can we talk
       about something?

02:08.795 --> 02:12.431
- If this is about your mother's
birthday party, I'm sorry.

02:12.533 --> 02:14.733
I got caught up writing
   and then I started studying

02:14.835 --> 02:18.704
and I told you I probably
    couldn't make it anyway.

02:18.806 --> 02:19.571
- So can we talk?

02:21.509 --> 02:22.641
- Yeah.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.343
You're breaking up with me?

02:26.080 --> 02:27.279
Be honest, are you cheating?

02:27.381 --> 02:28.413
- No, I'm not cheating on you.

02:28.516 --> 02:29.348
- Then what?

02:30.484 --> 02:32.084
- Look Chelsea, I'm sorry, okay,

02:32.186 --> 02:35.787
but, just, you never
      have time for me.

02:35.890 --> 02:38.090
You know, like I'm
        not a priority in

02:38.192 --> 02:40.359
I'm sorry, but, I'm done.

02:40.461 --> 02:42.995
- Listen, when I am
      done with this film,

02:43.097 --> 02:44.997
I promise things
        will get better.

02:47.034 --> 02:48.467
Please don't do this.

02:49.570 --> 02:52.771
(cellphone ringing)

02:52.873 --> 02:53.805
It's my mom.

02:55.075 --> 02:57.109
- I gotta go anyway.

02:57.211 --> 02:57.910
And I'm late.

02:58.746 --> 02:59.945
- Please don't go.

03:00.047 --> 03:01.380
- I'm sorry.

03:01.482 --> 03:02.447
- Eric, wait!

03:05.186 --> 03:06.418
Hi Mom.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.253
- Hey Sweetie, how are you?

03:08.355 --> 03:10.055
- Eric just split up with me.

03:10.157 --> 03:11.123
- What?

03:11.225 --> 03:11.857
Why?

03:11.959 --> 03:12.991
- I'm not really sure.

03:14.828 --> 03:16.261
- Baby, I'm so sorry.

03:16.363 --> 03:18.130
- Yeah, I'll tell you
      more when I get home.

03:18.232 --> 03:20.098
- [Beverly] Okay,
     yeah, we'll talk then.

03:20.201 --> 03:21.366
- Bye.
             - Bye.

03:21.468 --> 03:24.203
(cellphone beeps)

03:27.241 --> 03:28.006
- Jake!

03:29.577 --> 03:31.343
Jake, where are you?

03:31.445 --> 03:33.545
I need your help
    gettin' down the stairs.

03:33.647 --> 03:34.880
My knees are hurtin' again.

03:36.550 --> 03:37.549
Jake?

03:37.651 --> 03:38.584
Jake?

03:39.587 --> 03:40.786
Oh, ahhhhhh!

03:40.888 --> 03:43.255
(clattering)

03:43.357 --> 03:44.389
- I told you to be
       careful, mother.

03:44.491 --> 03:47.025
The stairs are so dangerous.

03:47.127 --> 03:49.795
(dramatic music)

03:53.300 --> 03:56.068
(upbeat dance music)

03:57.204 --> 03:58.770
- Seriously, come on, okay?

03:58.872 --> 04:00.505
There are plenty of
     other fish in the sea.

04:00.608 --> 04:01.440
- Yeah, right.

04:02.943 --> 04:06.445
- Look right there. (chuckles)

04:06.547 --> 04:07.579
See?

04:07.681 --> 04:08.447
Mmhmm.

04:09.783 --> 04:10.549
- Hi there.

04:11.619 --> 04:12.584
Is your name Chelsea?

04:12.686 --> 04:13.585
- Yes.

04:13.687 --> 04:16.622
Yes, I'm Chelsea, do I know you?

04:16.724 --> 04:17.789
- No, I'm Liam.

04:17.891 --> 04:19.358
Mila sent me over here
     to invite you guys

04:19.459 --> 04:20.858
to our table for some drinks.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.430
- Mila Walters?

04:25.532 --> 04:26.565
- The one and only.

04:26.667 --> 04:27.399
Come on!

04:27.501 --> 04:28.834
Eddy, put their drinks on us.

04:30.237 --> 04:31.370
- Who's Mila?

04:31.472 --> 04:33.739
- Do you remember that
     girl from high school?

04:33.841 --> 04:34.606
- Oh my God!

04:34.708 --> 04:35.741
The girl that got held back

04:35.843 --> 04:37.142
and then was kicked
       out of school.

04:37.244 --> 04:39.678
Yeah, I remember her getting
  in trouble all the time.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.114
- Yeah, we used to hang out
  all the time in grade school.

04:42.216 --> 04:43.615
I always wondered
      what happened to her.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.484
- Well, let's find out.

04:47.888 --> 04:49.054
- Chelsea, hey!

04:49.156 --> 04:50.522
- Hi!

04:50.624 --> 04:51.657
You remember Sarah, right?

04:51.759 --> 04:52.724
- I think so.

04:52.826 --> 04:54.326
Hi!
             - Hey.

04:54.428 --> 04:55.694
- Come sit down with us.

04:57.164 --> 05:00.299
Jenny, two more glasses
    for my friends over here.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.501
Oh, and another
      bottle of champagne.

05:02.603 --> 05:04.403
- Are you guys
     celebrating something?

05:04.505 --> 05:05.337
- Just life.

05:09.410 --> 05:12.477
(indistinct chattering)

05:19.687 --> 05:22.854
(glasses clinking)

05:22.956 --> 05:24.923
- At least you're not moping
 about what's his name anymore.

05:25.025 --> 05:26.525
Bye.
       - (laughs) Goodbye.

05:26.627 --> 05:28.694
- Chelsea, you coming with us?

05:28.796 --> 05:29.761
I have a car waiting outside.

05:29.863 --> 05:30.862
C'mon, let's go.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.469
(mellow music)

05:42.276 --> 05:43.675
- [Liam] Want some champagne?

05:43.777 --> 05:45.344
- Oh, I'm okay.

05:45.446 --> 05:46.111
I've had enough.

05:46.213 --> 05:47.012
I have a test tomorrow.

05:47.114 --> 05:47.879
- Got it.

05:50.884 --> 05:53.985
(sighs) So, what do you think?

05:56.223 --> 05:58.523
- This place is incredibly nice.

05:58.625 --> 06:00.158
- Well, the place
     next door is for sale.

06:00.260 --> 06:01.626
- (laughs) I wish.

06:01.729 --> 06:02.561
- Ah, come on.

06:02.663 --> 06:04.196
Once you sell your movie script

06:04.298 --> 06:05.530
and become a big time
      writer and director,

06:05.632 --> 06:07.599
you'll have all the money
    in the world to buy it.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.802
So when are you
      gonna let me read it?

06:10.904 --> 06:11.903
- Really?
            - Yeah.

06:12.005 --> 06:13.004
- You wanna read my script?

06:13.107 --> 06:14.673
- I wouldn't ask if
       I didn't want to.

06:14.775 --> 06:16.775
- Most people would just
   rather wait for the movie.

06:16.877 --> 06:17.809
- Well, not me.

06:17.911 --> 06:19.678
I'd love to read it!

06:19.780 --> 06:20.512
- Okay.

06:20.614 --> 06:21.680
Well, how about I get your email

06:21.782 --> 06:22.647
and I'll send it
        to you tomorrow.

06:22.750 --> 06:23.749
- Cool.

06:23.851 --> 06:24.750
- But you're gonna
       have to do it,

06:24.852 --> 06:27.185
'cause I'm kind
       of tipsy. (laughs)

06:27.287 --> 06:29.621
- Ah, you know what, I'm a
really good hacker but I cannot

06:29.723 --> 06:30.655
get past this
      fingerprint scanner,

06:30.758 --> 06:31.623
if you can do that for me.

06:31.725 --> 06:32.424
- [ Sorry, here.
        (phone chimes)

06:32.526 --> 06:34.459
- [Liam] There you go.

06:35.763 --> 06:37.262
There you go.

06:37.364 --> 06:38.096
- Sweet!

06:39.366 --> 06:43.335
(sighs) So are you and Mila?

06:43.437 --> 06:47.072
- No, well a long time ago.

06:47.174 --> 06:48.407
We're business partners now.

06:48.509 --> 06:49.674
We both own that club.

06:49.777 --> 06:50.809
- Oh, wow!

06:50.911 --> 06:51.977
- [Liam] Yeah.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.045
She's, she's kinda
      like a sister to me.

06:54.148 --> 06:55.514
You know I kind of just hang out

06:55.616 --> 06:57.516
and make sure she doesn't
    do anything too crazy.

06:57.618 --> 07:00.519
- (laughs) And there's a lot
of crazy things in Mila's life.

07:01.688 --> 07:02.354
- What about you?

07:02.456 --> 07:03.522
Are you crazy like Mila?

07:03.624 --> 07:05.390
- No, I'm not crazy!

07:06.693 --> 07:09.361
But there are definitely
    moments in my life

07:09.463 --> 07:11.763
that are completely nuts.

07:11.865 --> 07:12.531
- Yeah?
             - Yeah.

07:12.633 --> 07:13.632
Like what?

07:13.734 --> 07:15.834
What's so, what's so
      nuts in your life.

07:15.936 --> 07:16.768
Boyfriend?

07:16.870 --> 07:17.536
- Yes.

07:17.638 --> 07:18.770
No.

07:18.872 --> 07:21.706
As of 12 hours ago,
       I am newly single.

07:21.809 --> 07:24.409
- Oh, so it's a
       rough day for you.

07:24.511 --> 07:26.278
- Yeah, I didn't see it comin'.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.549
- A little something
      to help her relax.

07:33.253 --> 07:35.187
(footsteps)

07:35.289 --> 07:36.321
C'mon you guys.

07:36.423 --> 07:37.722
The show's about to start.

07:39.660 --> 07:40.392
- After you.

07:43.363 --> 07:44.896
- Oh, this is for you.

07:44.998 --> 07:47.232
- Oh I shouldn't, I
      have a test tomorrow.

07:47.334 --> 07:49.167
- (scoffs) C'mon, just one more.

07:49.269 --> 07:50.969
It's my special champagne.

07:51.071 --> 07:53.605
(Chelsea sighs)

07:55.642 --> 07:58.043
(footsteps)

08:01.148 --> 08:03.815
- So, what's going on?

08:04.785 --> 08:06.852
- Here's to us making
      your movie together.

08:07.688 --> 08:11.156
- Well, that would
       be great, but how?

08:11.258 --> 08:15.293
- Well I have a little business
and I make a lot of money.

08:16.463 --> 08:17.863
- What is it?

08:17.965 --> 08:20.031
- Interactive entertainment.

08:20.133 --> 08:23.902
- Mila, please don't tell me
  or web cam girl or something.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.070
- I'll tell you this.

08:25.172 --> 08:26.771
I make great money.

08:26.874 --> 08:27.906
When I got kicked out of school

08:28.008 --> 08:30.642
it was the last
      straw for my parents.

08:30.744 --> 08:33.678
We got into a huge
      fight and I ran away.

08:34.648 --> 08:36.414
- We all thought
      that you moved away.

08:36.517 --> 08:39.251
- Yeah, well that's what
     my parents told people.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.653
Look, I've made a lot of
    bad decisions in my life

08:41.755 --> 08:44.389
and I've screwed
       up a lot of things.

08:44.491 --> 08:46.224
But, right now this
       is working for me.

08:46.326 --> 08:49.828
It might not be exactly
  what I want to be doing but,

08:49.930 --> 08:51.263
it makes me a lot of money.

08:51.365 --> 08:52.197
- Really?

08:52.299 --> 08:53.331
A lot of money?

08:53.433 --> 08:56.201
- Yeah, look around.

08:56.303 --> 08:58.637
This is all because
       of my business.

08:58.739 --> 09:01.006
(clears throat)

09:01.108 --> 09:01.907
- Woah!

09:03.010 --> 09:06.912
This champagne is
     really strong. (laughs)

09:07.014 --> 09:08.880
- It's gotta little kick, right?

09:08.982 --> 09:10.615
- Yeah, to say the least!

09:11.919 --> 09:13.151
- What's in this again?

09:13.253 --> 09:14.786
- Just some good champagne,

09:14.888 --> 09:16.888
plus a little something
     to help you relax.

09:16.990 --> 09:19.491
- I think I just
      need to take it slow.

09:19.593 --> 09:20.258
Wait, what?

09:20.360 --> 09:21.059
What?

09:21.161 --> 09:21.793
What's in this?

09:21.895 --> 09:22.827
- Don't worry.

09:22.930 --> 09:24.529
- Mila...

09:24.631 --> 09:25.530
- Just chillax.

09:25.632 --> 09:26.731
The show's about to start.

09:28.535 --> 09:31.503
(suspenseful music)

09:35.375 --> 09:36.107
- [Jake] Oh.

09:36.209 --> 09:38.643
Huh, it's time for a new show.

09:39.813 --> 09:40.612
Hmm.

09:40.714 --> 09:41.913
Hello ladies.

09:44.484 --> 09:45.483
Let's see the new girl.

09:45.586 --> 09:48.286
(computer bleeps)

09:48.388 --> 09:50.789
- No, the new girl is
      not dancing tonight.

09:53.594 --> 09:55.827
- [Jake] She is stunning.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.563
(computer bleeps)

09:58.665 --> 09:59.965
- He says you're stunning.

10:00.901 --> 10:03.168
- You have gotta be kidding me.

10:04.171 --> 10:05.870
- She thinks you're kidding.

10:05.973 --> 10:07.172
C'mon, why don't you
      throw in another $100

10:07.274 --> 10:08.873
and show her you're serious.

10:11.011 --> 10:11.676
- [Jake] Sure.

10:11.778 --> 10:12.744
Here you go.

10:12.846 --> 10:13.745
(computer chimes)

10:13.847 --> 10:15.246
- He just doubled his amount.

10:15.349 --> 10:17.315
That's 200 bucks!

10:17.417 --> 10:19.651
C'mon, do a little
       dance for the man.

10:20.787 --> 10:21.720
- [Chelsea] I feel silly.

10:21.822 --> 10:22.887
I don't know what I'm doing.

10:22.990 --> 10:24.489
- C'mon.

10:24.591 --> 10:26.658
Feel the music. (laughs)

10:26.760 --> 10:28.393
You look so pretty.

10:28.495 --> 10:29.661
C'mon!

10:29.763 --> 10:30.895
You're a natural.

10:30.998 --> 10:33.264
- [Chelsea] (laughs)
      What am I doing?

10:33.367 --> 10:34.332
- [Mila] Just relax!

10:34.434 --> 10:35.367
Feel the music.
         - Ooh!

10:35.469 --> 10:37.636
(laughing)

10:39.539 --> 10:41.106
- [Jake] I love you.

10:41.208 --> 10:42.207
- You're a natural.
       - You happy Mila?

10:42.309 --> 10:44.042
- [Jake] I want to marry you.

10:44.144 --> 10:47.212
- He says he loves you
   and he wants to marry you.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.080
You're a hit! (laughs)

10:49.182 --> 10:52.117
(suspenseful music)

11:01.428 --> 11:03.428
- What time did you
       get in last night?

11:03.530 --> 11:04.996
- 4:30?

11:05.098 --> 11:06.531
- What?

11:06.633 --> 11:08.967
- I missed my torte class this
 morning, out of all classes.

11:09.069 --> 11:09.868
- Was it worth it?

11:09.970 --> 11:11.336
Is Mila gonna finance the movie?

11:11.438 --> 11:13.371
- We didn't even
     really talk about that.

11:14.741 --> 11:19.010
(sighs) I'm actually
      super worried.

11:20.414 --> 11:22.747
You're not gonna
       believe what I did.

11:22.849 --> 11:24.349
- You slept with that
      Liam guy, didn't you?

11:24.451 --> 11:25.850
- No!

11:25.952 --> 11:26.818
- Did you call Eric?

11:26.920 --> 11:27.686
- No!

11:29.189 --> 11:31.589
It's worse!

11:31.692 --> 11:32.457
- What then?

11:34.094 --> 11:36.728
- You wanna know how
      Mila makes her money?

11:36.830 --> 11:38.196
She runs a website,

11:38.298 --> 11:41.066
where girls take off their
clothes and boys tip 'em online.

11:41.168 --> 11:44.002
- Oh God, no, Chels, you didn't.

11:44.104 --> 11:44.736
- I did.

11:44.838 --> 11:45.537
- [Sara] How bad?

11:45.639 --> 11:46.404
- Topless.

11:47.941 --> 11:50.542
- Why, why would you do that?

11:50.644 --> 11:51.643
- I don't know.

11:51.745 --> 11:53.778
I was drunk and
      everyone was doing it

11:53.880 --> 11:56.948
and there were, there were
   guys literally paying me

11:57.050 --> 11:59.551
hundreds of dollars
       to take off my top!

11:59.653 --> 12:00.418
- So what?

12:01.221 --> 12:03.621
- (sighs) I don't know.

12:03.724 --> 12:05.690
I guess I didn't wanna
     seem like a prude.

12:06.827 --> 12:07.859
It was fun.

12:07.961 --> 12:10.962
Like we were having
      fun and last summer,

12:11.064 --> 12:12.831
my mom and I we went to France

12:12.933 --> 12:16.201
and we were topless on the beach
and that wasn't a big deal.

12:16.303 --> 12:18.436
- Gross, and, not
        the same thing.

12:18.538 --> 12:20.205
How could you let this happen?

12:20.307 --> 12:21.439
Chelsea, this is.

12:23.577 --> 12:24.642
- I don't know.

12:24.745 --> 12:26.444
Every time I hang out
     with Mila she has a way

12:26.546 --> 12:28.313
of talking me into
     doing the wrong thing.

12:28.415 --> 12:32.083
- Well, this one's
      on you, not her, so.

12:32.185 --> 12:32.884
- I know it.

12:34.121 --> 12:35.220
You're right.

12:35.322 --> 12:37.021
We used to hang out
      when we were younger.

12:37.124 --> 12:38.823
And it was always trouble.

12:38.925 --> 12:43.027
It started out as a little fun
 and then she always sort of

12:43.130 --> 12:45.063
Thelma and Louises me, you know?

12:46.032 --> 12:48.967
Like, this could be the
     last day of your life.

12:49.069 --> 12:52.704
- But it's not, and now you
   have tomorrow to deal with.

12:52.806 --> 12:55.473
And, Thelma & Louise never
   took their tops off online.

12:55.575 --> 12:57.542
And, now what, there's topless
  videos of you on the internet

12:57.644 --> 12:59.210
and you can't just
       take those down!

12:59.312 --> 13:01.813
- I know okay, I tried
      to go to the website.

13:01.915 --> 13:04.849
I tried to log on and delete
  anything that was posted.

13:05.685 --> 13:06.618
- Okay.

13:08.088 --> 13:09.387
You need to call him Mila.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.191
- Yeah, well I'll just
     talk to her in person,

13:13.293 --> 13:15.493
because I left my
      jacket at her house.

13:17.898 --> 13:20.031
(chair squeaking)

13:20.133 --> 13:21.833
- Just get that done
      by tonight, okay?

13:24.604 --> 13:25.470
Hey, Chels!

13:26.506 --> 13:27.906
Here it is.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.274
- Thanks.

13:29.376 --> 13:30.742
- [Mila] And this.

13:30.844 --> 13:31.609
- What is this?

13:31.711 --> 13:32.944
- Your take from last night.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.380
- About that.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.916
I really need you to delete
  what's ever on that website.

13:38.018 --> 13:40.418
It can really affect my career.

13:40.520 --> 13:41.653
- There's no recording.

13:41.755 --> 13:42.987
It's all live.

13:43.089 --> 13:44.155
- So it's gone?

13:44.257 --> 13:45.190
Completely?

13:45.292 --> 13:46.391
- Yeah.

13:46.493 --> 13:47.725
I mean, there's some
     stills, but that's it.

13:47.828 --> 13:49.727
- Can I access the
      website so I can see?

13:49.830 --> 13:51.062
- Of course.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.464
I'll give you a code so
     you don't have to pay.

13:53.567 --> 13:54.999
Do you wanna do that now?

13:55.101 --> 13:59.237
- I do, but is that
       Liam's computer?

13:59.339 --> 14:00.104
Is he here?

14:01.308 --> 14:02.841
- Yeah, it's his
   computer, but no, he left.

14:02.943 --> 14:04.976
He'll be back in a little.

14:05.078 --> 14:06.978
Hey do you have
        a thing for Liam?

14:07.080 --> 14:07.979
- What?

14:08.081 --> 14:09.881
No, gosh no!

14:09.983 --> 14:11.082
Eric and I just broke up.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.184
But I really hope it's not over.

14:13.286 --> 14:14.986
Liam told me he
      would read my script.

14:15.088 --> 14:19.891
- Ah, anyway, this is the
easiest money you'll ever make.

14:21.795 --> 14:23.761
Look, If you don't want
     to do it, that's fine.

14:23.864 --> 14:25.597
I do it 'cause
      that's how I survive.

14:25.699 --> 14:27.565
It got me off the streets.

14:27.667 --> 14:30.468
And plus, we all had a
  little bit of fun didn't we?

14:30.570 --> 14:32.904
- Mila, you spiked my drink!

14:33.006 --> 14:35.473
- We all experienced a
    little mood enhancement.

14:35.575 --> 14:37.342
And you were so much fun!

14:37.444 --> 14:40.211
- (scoffs) No, you
    always seem to have fun.

14:40.313 --> 14:42.714
And I'm the one that
    seems to get in trouble.

14:42.816 --> 14:44.682
- Yeah, well unlike me,
    you actually had a mother

14:44.784 --> 14:46.084
that cared about you.

14:46.186 --> 14:48.019
So, yeah, you got in trouble.

14:48.121 --> 14:51.522
I know that Beverly never
wanted you to hang out with me.

14:51.625 --> 14:53.791
I guess I never realized
    how lucky you were.

14:55.028 --> 14:56.327
- Look, this isn't right.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.229
Not like this, and it's not me.

14:59.499 --> 15:01.733
But I will take your
    money, as an investment.

15:02.702 --> 15:03.968
Welcome to the film business.

15:05.739 --> 15:08.673
- He says he loves you
   and he wants to marry you.

15:08.775 --> 15:09.540
You're a hit!

15:10.644 --> 15:13.144
(computer beeping)
       (recording rewinds)

15:13.246 --> 15:16.781
He says he loves you and
    he wants to marry you.

15:16.883 --> 15:18.149
You're a hit!

15:18.251 --> 15:21.286
(computer beeping)
       (recording rewinds)

15:21.388 --> 15:22.120
(dog barking)

15:24.257 --> 15:27.158
(suspenseful music)

15:37.737 --> 15:39.370
- [Chelsea] A thousand dollars?

15:47.580 --> 15:50.481
(keyboard clicking)

15:51.451 --> 15:54.319
(computer dings)

15:57.490 --> 15:59.190
(computer bleeps)

15:59.292 --> 16:00.258
- [Jake] Time for a show?

16:02.228 --> 16:05.363
- (scoffs) I don't think so.

16:05.465 --> 16:08.032
Sorry but that was
      my one and only show.

16:08.134 --> 16:09.267
Not gonna happen.

16:09.369 --> 16:10.768
- [Jake] Good.

16:10.870 --> 16:12.603
You're too cute and classy to
  be doing that type of stuff.

16:12.706 --> 16:14.572
What do you really
       do for a living?

16:14.674 --> 16:15.340
- [Beverly] Chelsea, come on.

16:15.442 --> 16:16.140
Dinner's ready!

16:16.242 --> 16:17.442
- Okay, Mom.

16:17.544 --> 16:19.477
Sorry, gotta go.

16:32.258 --> 16:34.425
So, I deposited the money
    this morning which means

16:34.527 --> 16:36.527
I'm that much closer to
     getting my movie made.

16:36.629 --> 16:38.229
- So Mila's gonna be in it?

16:38.331 --> 16:40.598
- Yeah, it was a small price
   to pay for getting it made.

16:40.700 --> 16:41.933
I'm just excited to call Abby

16:42.035 --> 16:43.701
and tell her that
        we're good to go.

16:43.803 --> 16:45.536
She's gonna have to use
    money to use that camera.

16:45.638 --> 16:47.739
- Yeah, just hope
        it all works out.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.107
- What do you mean?

16:49.209 --> 16:51.009
- I mean, you really think
    it's that good of an idea

16:51.111 --> 16:53.244
to be so closely tied with Mila?

16:53.346 --> 16:54.245
- Your point?

16:55.415 --> 16:57.548
- That you can be too
      trusting sometimes.

16:57.650 --> 16:58.850
And sometimes you're
      a little naive

16:58.952 --> 17:00.551
to people's real motives.

17:00.653 --> 17:02.120
- Really.

17:02.222 --> 17:03.154
So what do you think she wants?

17:03.256 --> 17:05.189
- Chels, I don't
       know exactly, okay.

17:05.290 --> 17:08.192
I just I get weird
       vibes from Mila.

17:08.294 --> 17:09.827
Liam too.

17:09.929 --> 17:11.128
- Well, I really like them.

17:11.231 --> 17:12.997
And they're actually
      super supportive.

17:13.098 --> 17:15.165
- (laughs) What, okay.

17:15.268 --> 17:16.434
I'm constantly
      telling you how great

17:16.536 --> 17:17.835
I think your writing is.

17:17.936 --> 17:20.038
I just don't have thousands
   of dollars to give to you.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.539
- Okay, don't act like that.

17:21.641 --> 17:23.674
I know that she has reasons
   for what she's doing.

17:23.777 --> 17:25.476
- Yeah, I'm sure she does.

17:27.847 --> 17:29.080
- I gotta get to class.

17:29.182 --> 17:30.381
(telephone ringing)

17:30.483 --> 17:32.316
Abby, Hey!

17:32.419 --> 17:33.084
Good news.

17:33.186 --> 17:34.419
We get to make the movie.

17:39.692 --> 17:40.491
Cut!

17:40.593 --> 17:41.626
That was good.

17:43.096 --> 17:44.462
Awesome!

17:44.564 --> 17:45.630
Great.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.298
Okay, one more angle,
    and then we can move on.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.368
(sighs) Okay.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.203
You guys are doing amazing.

17:52.305 --> 17:53.237
Thank you so much.

17:54.274 --> 17:55.907
So Mila still isn't here.

17:56.009 --> 17:57.575
She was supposed to be
     here over an hour ago.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.243
- We're losing our good light.

18:00.580 --> 18:01.612
- I'm just gonna text
      her and tell her,

18:01.714 --> 18:03.014
you know what, it's off.

18:04.017 --> 18:06.951
(telephone ringing)

18:12.258 --> 18:13.458
- Hey there big director.

18:13.560 --> 18:14.492
How's it going?

18:14.594 --> 18:15.660
I'm ready for my close up.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.428
- Did you not get any
      of my text messages?

18:17.530 --> 18:19.063
You're over an hour late.

18:19.165 --> 18:20.965
- I'm sorry I guess I
     didn't check my phone.

18:21.067 --> 18:22.166
- Well there's not gonna
    be any more daylight

18:22.268 --> 18:23.501
by the time we
       get to your scene.

18:23.603 --> 18:24.569
- Don't stress.

18:24.671 --> 18:25.803
We can do my scene another day.

18:25.905 --> 18:27.004
Let's hit up happy hour.

18:27.107 --> 18:28.239
On me.

18:28.341 --> 18:30.908
- No, Mila, I'm not going
    to happy hour, okay?

18:31.010 --> 18:32.376
And we can't do your
      scene another day

18:32.479 --> 18:35.780
because all the money we made
  yesterday, went to today!

18:35.882 --> 18:36.781
So I'm broke again.

18:39.352 --> 18:41.185
Okay everybody back
       to first positions.

18:43.223 --> 18:44.989
- Listen, I'm sorry I'm late.

18:45.091 --> 18:46.491
I get that every
      dollar counts, okay?

18:46.593 --> 18:48.092
I know how that feels.

18:48.194 --> 18:50.628
How about this: I'll
      invest in your movie.

18:51.464 --> 18:52.830
- What?

18:52.932 --> 18:55.366
I mean technically you've
  already invested in my movie.

18:55.468 --> 18:56.834
- Forget about that, okay?

18:56.936 --> 18:59.270
I messed up your day, so
    let me make it up to you.

18:59.372 --> 19:00.671
And we'll start over.

19:00.773 --> 19:03.241
All I ask is that I get the
   money back within a year.

19:03.343 --> 19:04.909
Oh and don't kick me
      out of your movie.

19:05.011 --> 19:06.611
I am a really good actress.

19:08.214 --> 19:09.647
- Are you serious?

19:09.749 --> 19:10.781
- How much do you need?

19:12.352 --> 19:14.252
(sighs)

19:16.523 --> 19:18.356
(computer dings)

19:18.458 --> 19:19.390
- [Jake] Hi, again.

19:20.493 --> 19:21.225
- Oh, great.

19:22.428 --> 19:26.164
(telephone ringing)

19:26.266 --> 19:28.599
- [Mila] Hey Chelsea, I'm
  sorry about that scene today.

19:28.701 --> 19:29.800
All my fault.

19:29.903 --> 19:31.068
I hope the extra thousand
    dollars is helpful

19:31.171 --> 19:33.905
and if you need any more
     money I'm here for you.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.206
We're having fun!

19:35.308 --> 19:36.340
See you soon!

19:36.442 --> 19:37.175
Bye.

19:39.012 --> 19:40.278
- Oh, what?

19:40.380 --> 19:41.712
Am I live?

19:41.814 --> 19:42.713
(computer bleeps)

19:42.815 --> 19:43.915
- [Jake] What are you doing?

19:45.485 --> 19:48.386
(keyboard clicking)

19:49.656 --> 19:51.389
(computer bleeps)

19:51.491 --> 19:52.723
No, no, no, no, no.

19:55.962 --> 19:57.862
(sighs)

20:00.099 --> 20:02.667
(keyboard clicking)

20:02.769 --> 20:05.436
(computer bleeps)

20:06.873 --> 20:09.473
(dramatic music)

20:17.984 --> 20:19.116
Chelsea Bilson.

20:24.290 --> 20:26.691
- Hey Eric, it's me.

20:26.793 --> 20:29.961
Just called to say hi.

20:30.063 --> 20:32.530
I have a belated birthday
    card for your mom

20:32.632 --> 20:36.834
and I was hoping that I could
  get it to you at some point.

20:38.071 --> 20:40.705
Look, I know that I haven't
   really been there for you

20:40.807 --> 20:45.243
with everything that's
    going on and, I'm sorry.

20:45.345 --> 20:49.247
Maybe we can meet up
    some time to discuss it.

20:51.050 --> 20:53.985
Anyway, well, I hope I
    see you at school today.

20:54.087 --> 20:55.019
Okay, bye.

20:56.089 --> 20:57.455
- [Beverly] Chelsea,
      what's going on?

20:57.557 --> 20:58.322
- Nothing.

20:59.158 --> 21:00.925
What are you doing with those?

21:01.027 --> 21:02.827
- You're supposed to be
  studying for your law classes

21:02.929 --> 21:04.028
and you're making a movie?

21:04.130 --> 21:05.396
- Mom, I can do both.

21:05.498 --> 21:06.764
I always have before.

21:06.866 --> 21:07.932
- Maybe, but the classes

21:08.034 --> 21:09.333
are getting more
      difficult each year.

21:09.435 --> 21:10.568
You need to focus.

21:10.670 --> 21:11.502
- I will.

21:11.604 --> 21:12.436
Don't worry, mom.

21:13.973 --> 21:16.540
- That's a lot of money
  you're spending on your film.

21:16.643 --> 21:18.709
Where is it all coming from?

21:18.811 --> 21:20.411
- I tutor now.

21:20.513 --> 21:21.746
In the student center.

21:21.848 --> 21:23.581
It makes me a lot of money.

21:23.683 --> 21:25.216
- When do you have
       time for that?

21:26.052 --> 21:27.652
- While I'm studying too.

21:27.754 --> 21:30.421
It's the same material
     so it helps me out.

21:30.523 --> 21:31.822
- I want you to promise
   that you're not gonna work

21:31.924 --> 21:34.258
on your film until
      the end of the year.

21:34.360 --> 21:35.259
Because you don't have
      time for all of this,

21:35.361 --> 21:37.662
and your schoolwork will suffer.

21:37.764 --> 21:39.830
- Mom, don't do this to me!

21:39.932 --> 21:43.934
Please, I promise you I will
   work hard and I will focus.

21:44.037 --> 21:46.671
- Well, I am working hard and
  I am paying a lot of money.

21:46.773 --> 21:48.439
I can't afford to
      have you fall behind.

21:48.541 --> 21:51.242
- Yeah, but mom, what if they
  give me a film scholarship?

21:51.344 --> 21:53.744
Then you wouldn't
      have to work so hard.

21:53.846 --> 21:56.681
- Why did you keep this from me?

21:56.783 --> 21:57.848
- I don't know.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.686
Maybe because you
        do work so hard.

22:02.622 --> 22:04.455
I didn't want to worry you.

22:04.557 --> 22:07.558
And you're finally up
     for that big promotion.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.360
I know how much that means you.

22:10.363 --> 22:13.364
- Well, I know how much
   you love making your films.

22:13.466 --> 22:15.232
But you're gonna be a lawyer,

22:15.335 --> 22:16.567
and you're gonna have
      a much better life

22:16.669 --> 22:18.402
than I was able to give you.

22:18.504 --> 22:20.304
- Mom, what are
       you talking about?

22:21.374 --> 22:23.874
We have an amazing life.

22:23.976 --> 22:24.942
Don't ever say that.

22:26.412 --> 22:28.979
Remember, you and me right?

22:31.884 --> 22:33.951
- Yeah, you and me babe.

22:37.490 --> 22:38.289
Awe, you.

22:40.827 --> 22:41.826
Whew.

22:41.928 --> 22:42.993
I have to get to work.

22:44.297 --> 22:46.864
Don't you get your
     exam grades back today?

22:47.834 --> 22:48.566
- Yes, mother.

22:48.668 --> 22:49.633
And I will keep you posted.

22:50.970 --> 22:52.470
Hey, good luck on
        that promotion!

22:54.941 --> 22:57.041
- [Interviewer] Chelsea,
 congratulations on your award.

22:57.143 --> 22:58.709
Tell us what inspires you.

22:58.811 --> 23:01.946
- Well my biggest inspiration
  is my mom, Beverly,

23:02.048 --> 23:03.147
growing up without a father,

23:03.249 --> 23:05.416
she was just the biggest
    role model to me.

23:05.518 --> 23:07.818
So, eek, this ones for you, mom!

23:07.920 --> 23:10.221
Thank you! (laughs)

23:13.259 --> 23:14.325
- [Jake] Beverly Bilson.

23:14.427 --> 23:16.761
(keyboard clicking)

23:16.863 --> 23:18.362
Westvale insurance.

23:21.868 --> 23:24.802
(suspenseful music)

23:32.712 --> 23:34.845
(clattering)

23:36.649 --> 23:37.314
I'm sorry.

23:37.417 --> 23:38.649
I'm a mess.(chuckles)

23:38.751 --> 23:39.583
Thanks.

23:41.320 --> 23:43.721
Hey, you look like
     you could use a smile.

23:43.823 --> 23:47.124
- (chuckles) It's
       that obvious, huh?

23:47.226 --> 23:48.526
I'm just having a bad day.

23:49.529 --> 23:50.561
- What's wrong?

23:50.663 --> 23:53.130
I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry.

23:53.232 --> 23:54.031
- It's okay.

23:55.334 --> 23:58.169
I just, I got passed
      over for a promotion.

23:58.271 --> 23:59.336
I mean I'll survive.

23:59.439 --> 24:00.271
I just really thought
      that I would get it.

24:00.373 --> 24:02.072
- That is disappointing.

24:02.175 --> 24:02.973
I'm sorry to hear it.

24:03.075 --> 24:03.874
- [Beverly] Thanks.

24:03.976 --> 24:04.708
- Sorry, I'm so rude.

24:04.811 --> 24:06.043
I'm Jake.

24:06.145 --> 24:08.679
I manage the Metro Street
    Gym in the neighborhood.

24:08.781 --> 24:09.580
- Beverly, nice to meet you.

24:09.682 --> 24:11.081
- Nice to meet you.

24:11.184 --> 24:13.684
I feel like there's
   something I can do for you.

24:13.786 --> 24:14.785
- Well, I doubt that.

24:14.887 --> 24:15.619
What's done is done.

24:15.721 --> 24:17.755
- No, not that.

24:17.857 --> 24:19.757
I'm giving away free
      gym memberships.

24:19.859 --> 24:22.626
Sorry, trying to give
   away free gym memberships.

24:22.728 --> 24:25.696
It doesn't seem like anybody
in this building is interested.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.631
I think that this is
      exactly what you need

24:27.733 --> 24:29.834
to take your mind off
     of this little setback.

24:31.737 --> 24:33.938
- It is just a little setback.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.573
- Looks that way. (chuckles)

24:35.675 --> 24:37.475
- Free gym membership?

24:37.577 --> 24:38.642
What's the catch?

24:38.744 --> 24:39.810
- (laughs) No catch.

24:39.912 --> 24:41.412
It's just three free months

24:41.514 --> 24:44.348
and three personal
       training sessions.

24:44.450 --> 24:46.417
- Wow, that does sound great.

24:46.519 --> 24:47.117
- It is.

24:47.220 --> 24:48.219
At least it will be.

24:48.321 --> 24:49.753
I will make sure of it.

24:49.856 --> 24:52.122
Look, there is nothing
     better for a bad day

24:52.225 --> 24:53.224
than a good workout.

24:54.327 --> 24:56.260
- You say all the
     right things, don't ya?

24:56.362 --> 24:58.028
- I try.

24:58.130 --> 24:59.497
So, what do you say?

24:59.599 --> 25:02.032
Maybe come by after work one
  day, I'll give you the tour,

25:02.134 --> 25:04.168
and a free bottle of
       my own supplements.

25:04.270 --> 25:05.202
No pressure.

25:05.304 --> 25:07.771
- Yeah, perhaps.

25:07.874 --> 25:08.839
Nice to meet you.

25:08.941 --> 25:10.407
- Nice to meet you too, Beverly.

25:17.550 --> 25:21.252
(indistinct chatter)

25:21.354 --> 25:22.720
- So what did ya get?

25:23.656 --> 25:24.455
- Not good.

25:25.358 --> 25:26.690
- Sorry.

25:26.792 --> 25:28.926
I know it's been kinda
     rough on you lately.

25:30.329 --> 25:31.262
You gonna tell your mom?

25:32.231 --> 25:33.163
- I'm so screwed.

25:36.135 --> 25:39.036
(keyboard clicking)

25:40.006 --> 25:41.572
- Hey, what's up?

25:41.674 --> 25:43.607
- Jake, you have a client?

25:43.709 --> 25:44.742
- Sure, send them in.

25:45.678 --> 25:46.911
Hey, you!

25:47.013 --> 25:48.012
- Hey, I'm here.

25:48.114 --> 25:49.713
- I wasn't sure you'd make it.

25:49.815 --> 25:50.981
- I wasn't either.

25:51.083 --> 25:52.049
- I hope those are gym clothes.

25:52.151 --> 25:52.816
- Um hmm.

25:52.919 --> 25:53.817
- [Jake] Great.

25:53.920 --> 25:54.685
Let's do it

26:06.766 --> 26:08.299
- [Chelsea] Extras needed.

26:08.401 --> 26:09.833
PM me for details.

26:11.437 --> 26:12.503
(knocking)

26:12.605 --> 26:13.337
Come in.

26:14.407 --> 26:17.141
- Hey, how's it going today?

26:17.243 --> 26:18.375
- I'm alright.

26:19.278 --> 26:21.445
I'm sorry about your promotion.

26:21.547 --> 26:23.013
(sighs)

26:23.115 --> 26:24.114
- Thanks.

26:26.886 --> 26:29.553
You know, there'll
       be another chance.

26:29.655 --> 26:30.421
- Yeah.

26:31.791 --> 26:32.957
- You know what I did today?

26:33.926 --> 26:38.062
I found us a great deal,
    and I joined a gym.

26:38.164 --> 26:41.265
So now, we both have memberships
and a personal trainer.

26:43.703 --> 26:44.535
- Wow.

26:44.637 --> 26:46.036
Thanks.

26:46.138 --> 26:48.472
But I don't know if I'm gonna
  have time to do all that.

26:48.574 --> 26:49.607
- I think it's important

26:49.709 --> 26:51.375
that we spend a little
     bit more time together.

26:56.282 --> 26:57.381
C minus?

27:00.686 --> 27:01.752
Chelsea.

27:03.155 --> 27:05.923
I know that it is hard with
   you and Eric breaking up,

27:06.025 --> 27:07.257
and school is getting
      more difficult,

27:07.360 --> 27:08.425
but this just proves my point.

27:08.527 --> 27:09.727
The movie is too much!

27:09.829 --> 27:10.728
- Mom, no it's not!

27:12.531 --> 27:14.031
Please, just let me handle it.

27:15.334 --> 27:18.035
I've really gotta do this, okay?

27:20.506 --> 27:21.872
Look, I actually wanted
     to get my work done

27:21.974 --> 27:24.274
before I go to bed, so.

27:28.681 --> 27:31.849
(keyboard clicking)

27:31.951 --> 27:32.750
- Okay.

27:36.789 --> 27:41.659
But, if you need any help with
 anything, just let me know.

27:43.629 --> 27:46.597
- Thanks, but I'm fine.

27:49.335 --> 27:52.269
(suspenseful music)

28:20.166 --> 28:20.998
Great, cut!

28:21.100 --> 28:21.799
That was awesome.

28:21.901 --> 28:22.533
Let's move to close-ups.

28:22.635 --> 28:23.400
- Okay.

28:25.471 --> 28:26.236
- Hey.

28:26.338 --> 28:27.438
How's it all editing together?

28:28.274 --> 28:29.473
- It's so awesome!
       Yeah?

28:29.575 --> 28:30.274
- It's going great.

28:30.376 --> 28:31.008
Yeah.

28:31.110 --> 28:31.809
Is that Liam?

28:31.911 --> 28:33.277
- Hey girls.

28:33.379 --> 28:35.245
Any room for one more extra?

28:35.347 --> 28:36.613
See, I told you I'd come.

28:36.716 --> 28:37.548
Even if it was a Sunday.

28:37.650 --> 28:39.483
This looks, it looks great!

28:40.553 --> 28:41.251
- [Chelsea] Yeah it's great.

28:41.353 --> 28:42.720
It's a lot of work.

28:42.822 --> 28:44.655
- [Liam] It looks amazing.

28:44.757 --> 28:45.923
- [Abby] Chels, the batteries?

28:46.025 --> 28:46.657
- Oh!

28:46.759 --> 28:47.391
Right.

28:47.493 --> 28:48.292
Give me a second.

28:54.200 --> 28:55.532
- [Sara] Hey Chels, wait up!

28:55.634 --> 28:57.234
- I have to grab the batteries
 outta my car, what's up?

28:57.336 --> 28:58.836
- Who's that guy staring at you?

28:58.938 --> 28:59.870
- [Chelsea] Where?

29:01.373 --> 29:03.607
- [Sara] Wait, he was there
 like two seconds ago, I swear.

29:04.443 --> 29:05.275
- Come on.

29:09.215 --> 29:10.214
What's this.

29:10.316 --> 29:12.816
- Who do you think
       they're from, Eric?

29:12.918 --> 29:15.419
- No, he wouldn't leave
     something on my car.

29:15.521 --> 29:16.253
- Liam?

29:17.456 --> 29:19.723
- Angels trumpets for my angel.

29:21.360 --> 29:22.593
I doubt it was Liam.

29:23.763 --> 29:25.262
What do you think
      happened to that guy?

29:25.364 --> 29:26.029
- I don't know.

29:26.132 --> 29:27.598
It's like he vanished.

29:27.700 --> 29:28.665
It's kind of creepy.

29:32.938 --> 29:35.372
(door slams)

29:36.242 --> 29:38.075
- I'm really happy we're
    doing this together.

29:38.177 --> 29:39.543
Hey, Jake!

29:39.645 --> 29:41.512
This is my daughter, Chelsea.

29:41.614 --> 29:43.614
- It is a pleasure
      to meet you Chelsea.

29:43.716 --> 29:45.582
I've heard a lot of good
    things from your mother.

29:45.684 --> 29:47.050
I've got a great
        workout planned,

29:47.153 --> 29:49.820
and you both get a bottle
   of my very own supplements.

29:49.922 --> 29:50.687
Are you excited?

29:51.590 --> 29:52.956
- Yeah, I guess!
        - Yes,

29:53.058 --> 29:54.358
yes, great!

29:54.460 --> 29:55.025
Let's put a smile on that
    face with a good workout.

29:55.127 --> 29:56.193
Are you ladies ready?

29:56.295 --> 29:56.927
- [Beverly] Sounds good.

29:57.029 --> 29:57.995
- Cool, let's do it.

30:01.700 --> 30:04.301
(dramatic music)

30:37.670 --> 30:39.169
- [Mila] He says
        you're stunning.

30:40.072 --> 30:42.005
Do a little dance for the man.

30:42.107 --> 30:42.873
C'mon!

30:51.383 --> 30:52.683
Now do a turn.

30:52.785 --> 30:54.384
You're a hit. (laughs)

30:54.486 --> 30:56.920
He says he loves you and
    he wants to marry you.

30:57.022 --> 30:58.555
Ooh! (laughs)

30:58.657 --> 31:00.123
- Thank you so much, Jake.

31:00.226 --> 31:01.258
- Good night, ladies.

31:02.127 --> 31:02.960
I'll see you soon.

31:08.334 --> 31:09.566
- [Beverly] Look at this.

31:13.072 --> 31:15.005
- (sighs) They have
       no problem posting

31:15.107 --> 31:18.876
anything about their lives,
   for everyone to see it.

31:18.978 --> 31:20.077
- Here's a nightclub.

31:22.948 --> 31:24.281
That's Mila.

31:25.985 --> 31:27.751
Chelsea's back in
        touch with her?

31:29.154 --> 31:31.655
Why would she have
    anything to do with her?

31:31.757 --> 31:33.957
In high school, Mila
      and Chelsea were out,

31:34.059 --> 31:36.059
and she shoplifted a necklace.

31:36.161 --> 31:37.694
Chelsea didn't know
       anything about it.

31:37.796 --> 31:39.029
- What happened?

31:39.131 --> 31:41.331
- Well Mila got arrested
   and Chelsea got taken down

31:41.433 --> 31:42.499
to the police station
      and questioned.

31:42.601 --> 31:43.867
I had to go pick her up.

31:43.969 --> 31:44.601
- Wow.

31:44.703 --> 31:46.236
- She was so scared.

31:46.338 --> 31:47.371
- Well, I wouldn't
    worry about Chels honey.

31:47.473 --> 31:49.640
She's got a good head
      on her shoulders.

31:49.742 --> 31:52.276
I mean, what could this Mila
  girl possibly do, right?

32:02.087 --> 32:04.788
(cellphone bleeps)

32:04.890 --> 32:08.792
- [Jake] Where have you
been, Pretty Pamela?

32:08.894 --> 32:10.594
- [Chelsea] How'd
you get my number?

32:11.830 --> 32:14.164
- [Jake] Or should
I say Chelsea?

32:15.768 --> 32:16.733
- [Chelsea] Who are you?

32:16.835 --> 32:17.768
How did you find me?

32:17.870 --> 32:19.703
- [Jake] Did you get
my flowers today?

32:21.540 --> 32:23.040
- [Chelsea] I'm
gonna report you.

32:24.877 --> 32:25.676
- [Jake] To who?

32:25.778 --> 32:26.743
For what?

32:26.845 --> 32:28.378
I've done nothing!

32:28.480 --> 32:29.413
- [Chelsea] And I've
done nothing to you.

32:29.515 --> 32:30.647
Please stop!

32:31.483 --> 32:32.816
- [Jake] I can't help it.

32:32.918 --> 32:33.984
I wanna be near you.

32:34.920 --> 32:36.119
- [Chelsea] I'm blocking you.

32:37.122 --> 32:38.055
- [Jake] That was a
beautiful sun dress

32:38.157 --> 32:39.556
you were wearing today.

32:39.658 --> 32:42.292
(dramatic music)

33:01.213 --> 33:03.880
(tires squealing)

33:05.384 --> 33:07.417
Yes, I know where you live.

33:07.519 --> 33:08.518
You are so beautiful!

33:13.425 --> 33:15.659
- [Sara] Well, has
       he threatened you?

33:15.761 --> 33:16.626
- No.

33:16.729 --> 33:18.161
- This is Mila's fault.

33:18.263 --> 33:20.230
I told you, she's a nightmare.

33:20.332 --> 33:21.898
- What should I do?

33:22.001 --> 33:23.633
- You should call the police.

33:23.736 --> 33:25.335
- And tell them what?

33:25.437 --> 33:27.604
If my mother finds
     out, it will kill her.

33:27.706 --> 33:28.438
No, you know what?

33:28.540 --> 33:29.373
No, she would kill me first!

33:31.377 --> 33:32.743
(sighs) This is such a mess.

33:32.845 --> 33:34.711
- Listen you
      deleted the channel,

33:34.813 --> 33:37.447
so there's no evidence that
   you did the webcam thing.

33:38.584 --> 33:39.483
- What have I done?

33:40.753 --> 33:42.019
I wasn't even thinking straight!

33:42.121 --> 33:44.221
It's just, I'm such an idiot.

33:44.323 --> 33:46.623
- You should confront
    Mila, okay, she's the one

33:46.725 --> 33:48.859
that got you into this, she
  should help you clean it up.

33:50.262 --> 33:50.994
- Yeah,

33:52.064 --> 33:52.763
I agree.

33:54.099 --> 33:56.433
- This is scary, Chelsea.

33:57.703 --> 33:59.603
(sighs)

34:00.472 --> 34:01.405
- You deleted your channel,

34:01.507 --> 34:02.973
but we still have
        his screen name.

34:03.075 --> 34:05.208
Maybe we can use that
      to track him down.

34:05.310 --> 34:06.209
- Okay.

34:06.311 --> 34:07.377
But how?

34:07.479 --> 34:09.112
- We can try to track
      him on the website.

34:09.214 --> 34:10.213
- How long will that take?

34:10.315 --> 34:11.681
- I'm not sure.

34:11.784 --> 34:12.849
Liam?

34:12.951 --> 34:14.885
- I mean it's gonna
       take some work.

34:14.987 --> 34:16.018
It won't happen overnight.

34:16.121 --> 34:16.987
- Great!

34:17.089 --> 34:18.088
So in the meantime, what,

34:18.190 --> 34:20.190
he's just gonna show
      up in my bedroom?

34:20.292 --> 34:22.092
I have to call the police!

34:22.194 --> 34:23.427
That's a bad idea.

34:23.529 --> 34:25.027
If you do, they're
      gonna investigate you

34:25.130 --> 34:26.696
and all your friends.

34:26.799 --> 34:27.531
- What's wrong?

34:27.632 --> 34:28.732
You have something to hide?

34:29.768 --> 34:30.934
- Liam's right.

34:31.036 --> 34:32.436
I've dealt with the
   police enough to know that

34:32.538 --> 34:35.371
the first person they're gonna
 want to talk to is your mom.

34:35.474 --> 34:36.672
- I don't know what to do.

34:36.775 --> 34:38.175
- Just give us a few more days

34:38.277 --> 34:39.743
to get some information
     on this guy.

34:39.844 --> 34:42.312
- Mila, what if I don't
     have a few more days?

34:47.286 --> 34:48.251
(ca- It's cute.ps)

34:50.054 --> 34:51.487
Okay, I should head out, huh?

34:51.590 --> 34:52.722
Eric's gonna be here any second.

34:52.824 --> 34:54.991
So, you okay?

34:55.094 --> 34:56.560
- I'm okay.

34:56.661 --> 34:57.461
Thanks for hanging out with me.

34:57.563 --> 34:59.229
- Of course, Chels.

34:59.331 --> 35:00.464
What are friends for?

35:00.566 --> 35:01.364
Good luck.

35:06.004 --> 35:06.770
- Jake!

35:08.273 --> 35:09.005
Hey, Jake.

35:09.108 --> 35:09.906
- Hi.

35:11.343 --> 35:13.743
And they say you never run
   into anyone in Los Angeles.

35:13.846 --> 35:15.612
- Yeah, what are you
      doing at the park?

35:15.714 --> 35:19.149
- I'm just working
       out with a client.

35:19.251 --> 35:21.017
Do you want some company?

35:21.120 --> 35:23.620
- Oh, I'm actually, I'm
    waiting for my boyfriend.

35:23.722 --> 35:25.722
- Oh, I understand.

35:27.326 --> 35:28.225
Is everything alright?

35:28.327 --> 35:30.360
You have a sadness in your eyes.

35:30.462 --> 35:32.129
Anything I can do to help?

35:32.231 --> 35:32.963
- Oh.

35:33.065 --> 35:34.364
No, I'm fine.

35:34.466 --> 35:37.434
I've just been crazy frazzled
  but, everything's ok.

35:38.303 --> 35:40.103
- Well, remember, we
    have a lot of work to do.

35:40.205 --> 35:40.871
You and me.

35:40.973 --> 35:42.239
So don't be a stranger.

35:42.341 --> 35:43.840
- I won't, I promise.

35:43.942 --> 35:44.975
- Alright.

35:45.077 --> 35:45.909
Can I get a smile?

35:47.079 --> 35:48.078
(laughs)
        It's easy, right?

35:48.180 --> 35:50.180
Alright, tell your
      mom I said hi, okay?

35:50.282 --> 35:50.914
- I will.

35:51.016 --> 35:51.815
- I'll see you soon.

35:51.917 --> 35:52.883
- Bye.

35:54.853 --> 35:55.819
- Hey,
             (gasps)

35:55.921 --> 35:56.920
sorry I'm late.

35:57.022 --> 35:57.787
- Hi.

36:01.527 --> 36:03.693
(sighs)

36:03.795 --> 36:05.829
I feel like I haven't
      seen you in weeks.

36:05.931 --> 36:06.663
- Yeah, I know.

36:07.566 --> 36:08.932
I felt like we should meet up.

36:09.034 --> 36:12.235
You know we left things a little
weird last time we talked.

36:12.337 --> 36:13.470
- Yeah.

36:13.572 --> 36:14.938
Eric I'm really sorry.

36:15.941 --> 36:17.374
- Me too.

36:17.476 --> 36:20.110
I could have been more
     understanding but,

36:21.313 --> 36:22.646
it's just I really feel like you

36:22.748 --> 36:24.714
weren't putting in any more
   effort with me, you know?

36:24.816 --> 36:26.583
- I never meant to hurt you.

36:28.654 --> 36:30.720
Maybe we can start over?

36:32.024 --> 36:33.190
- Yeah.

36:33.292 --> 36:34.224
Yeah, I'd like that.

36:35.961 --> 36:37.961
How about we go to
       dinner tomorrow.

36:38.063 --> 36:39.162
- A date?

36:39.264 --> 36:40.530
- Yeah.

36:40.632 --> 36:42.566
- I would love that. (laughs)

36:48.307 --> 36:51.241
(computer bleeps)

36:52.711 --> 36:53.510
- Gotcha!

36:57.549 --> 37:00.217
(dramatic music)

37:02.854 --> 37:04.621
(car door slams)

37:05.023 --> 37:06.723
(footsteps)

37:08.093 --> 37:08.892
(door handle rattles)

37:26.778 --> 37:29.412
(car door slams)

37:34.820 --> 37:35.719
- Hi there.

37:35.821 --> 37:37.187
- Hey.

37:37.289 --> 37:38.455
Can I help you?

37:38.557 --> 37:39.656
- No, it's cool.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.024
I just, I was looking
      for a friend's house.

37:41.126 --> 37:42.359
I was looking for a friend's
  house. (voice echoes)

37:42.461 --> 37:43.693
I was looking for a friend's
  house. (voice echoes)

37:43.795 --> 37:44.694
I was looking for a friend's
  house. (voice echoes)

37:44.796 --> 37:45.528
I was looking for
        a friends house,

37:45.631 --> 37:46.162
I must have the wrong place.

37:46.265 --> 37:46.997
Sorry to bother you.

37:47.099 --> 37:49.065
- Actually, wait a minute.

37:49.167 --> 37:51.201
I'm kind of lucky
      that you stopped by.

37:51.303 --> 37:52.168
You got a minute?

37:53.639 --> 37:55.705
I've got a bad back, and I've
  got this box in the truck

37:55.807 --> 37:57.007
I really need to get out.

37:58.310 --> 37:59.309
It's right over there.

37:59.411 --> 38:00.777
I'd really appreciate it man,

38:00.879 --> 38:02.178
you'd really be helping me out.

38:03.382 --> 38:04.047
- Yeah, sure.

38:04.149 --> 38:05.081
Why not?

38:05.183 --> 38:06.016
- [Jake] Cool.

38:06.118 --> 38:06.783
- This is a nice place you have.

38:06.885 --> 38:07.684
- Thanks.

38:07.786 --> 38:08.752
It was my mom's,
        before she died.

38:10.155 --> 38:10.954
- I'm sorry to hear that.

38:11.056 --> 38:12.088
- It was sudden.

38:12.190 --> 38:13.990
She had an accident
       here at the house.

38:14.092 --> 38:15.125
Wow, that's terrible.

38:15.227 --> 38:17.894
Fell down the stairs
       and broke her neck.

38:17.996 --> 38:19.095
I'm sorry.
   - Must be really difficult.

38:19.197 --> 38:19.996
Yeah, it's locked.
   - Let me get that for you.

38:20.098 --> 38:22.999
(suspenseful music)

38:24.770 --> 38:25.902
- [Liam] Ah, there's
      no box in there.

38:26.004 --> 38:26.770
Ah! (grunts)

38:39.151 --> 38:42.552
(dramatic music swells)

38:56.301 --> 38:57.000
(knocking)

38:57.102 --> 38:58.868
- Hey, I'm going to bed.

38:58.970 --> 38:59.969
I didn't see you today.

39:00.072 --> 39:01.037
I hope it was better.

39:01.907 --> 39:02.672
Good night.

39:03.942 --> 39:04.908
- Mom?

39:07.212 --> 39:08.078
I'm sorry.

39:09.748 --> 39:12.148
I've been really
       screwing up lately.

39:14.319 --> 39:18.555
- I'm also sorry if I've been
  causing you any extra stress.

39:21.460 --> 39:23.827
I know that I can push
    a little hard sometimes.

39:24.663 --> 39:29.566
- I just feel like I'm drowning
every single day at school.

39:30.369 --> 39:33.803
But, I know it's important
   for me to get a degree.

39:35.207 --> 39:37.340
You've helped me
       so much and I just,

39:40.112 --> 39:41.277
I don't wanna let you down.

39:43.081 --> 39:47.984
- Sweetheart, you have
     never disappointed me.

39:49.788 --> 39:52.455
I am so proud of
       who you've become.

39:54.726 --> 39:55.458
- Thank you.

39:57.329 --> 39:58.661
I love you.

39:58.764 --> 40:00.196
- Yeah, I love you too.

40:00.298 --> 40:01.531
So much!

40:04.703 --> 40:06.836
(tapping)

40:10.509 --> 40:11.908
- [Jake] Angels trumpets.

40:12.010 --> 40:13.176
Beautiful.

40:13.278 --> 40:14.144
Potent.

40:14.246 --> 40:15.412
Natures' chloroform.

40:15.514 --> 40:18.882
(liquid pouring)

40:18.984 --> 40:20.884
(suspenseful music)

40:21.820 --> 40:23.853
(cell phone buzzes)

40:26.958 --> 40:27.991
- Hey, Sara.

40:28.093 --> 40:29.159
- Hey Chels.

40:29.261 --> 40:32.529
- Okay, so let's plan
      to carpool tomorrow

40:32.631 --> 40:35.999
and then we'll meet my
    mom at Metro Street Gym.

40:36.101 --> 40:38.601
Probably around six
     when she gets off work.

40:38.703 --> 40:40.069
I think you need to
       go to the website

40:40.172 --> 40:41.438
and get a visitor's pass.

40:41.540 --> 40:42.605
- Okay, yeah.

40:42.707 --> 40:45.141
I'll do it before I head
    over in the morning.

40:45.243 --> 40:46.676
You're sure it's cool I go?

40:46.778 --> 40:47.811
- Yeah, of course.

40:48.713 --> 40:51.080
And Sara, thanks.

40:52.184 --> 40:53.049
I'll see you later.

40:53.151 --> 40:53.817
Bye.

40:53.919 --> 40:55.051
- [Sara] Ok, bye.

40:59.558 --> 41:04.060
(door opens and closes)

41:05.063 --> 41:06.362
(door locks)

41:07.098 --> 41:08.264
(foot steps)

41:11.603 --> 41:12.836
(engine accelerating)

41:20.846 --> 41:24.280
(tense music)

41:29.888 --> 41:31.087
(keyboard typing)

41:33.458 --> 41:35.124
- Metro Street Gym.

41:37.195 --> 41:38.261
Guest pass.

41:40.165 --> 41:41.197
Trainers.

41:44.336 --> 41:46.169
(keyboard clicking)

41:46.271 --> 41:48.104
You look familiar.

41:48.206 --> 41:49.339
Jake Peters.

41:50.509 --> 41:52.275
(dramatic music)

41:52.377 --> 41:53.443
Oh my God!

41:54.813 --> 41:55.979
(telephone beeping)

41:56.081 --> 41:58.047
(telephone ringing)

41:58.149 --> 41:59.048
- [Chelsea] Hey what's up?

41:59.150 --> 42:00.250
This is Chelsea,
       leave me a message

42:00.352 --> 42:02.218
and I'll get right back to you.

42:02.320 --> 42:03.620
- Chelsea, Chelsea.

42:03.722 --> 42:06.289
Hey can you call me as soon
   as you get this please.

42:06.391 --> 42:07.323
Yeah, I need to talk to you.

42:07.425 --> 42:07.957
Thanks.

42:08.059 --> 42:10.326
(knocking)

42:12.163 --> 42:13.396
- Hey.

42:13.498 --> 42:14.564
- You woke me up.

42:14.666 --> 42:17.934
- Oh, sorry. I'm in
       the neighborhood.

42:18.036 --> 42:19.536
I wanted to drop off
      some supplements.

42:19.638 --> 42:21.571
Remember, I promised
      you a free bottle?

42:21.673 --> 42:23.139
It's my own formula.

42:23.241 --> 42:25.074
I have them made
       right here in L.A..

42:25.176 --> 42:26.543
(telephone vibrates)

42:26.645 --> 42:27.510
- [Sara] Your trainer is the
   same guy I saw in the park.

42:27.612 --> 42:28.411
He could be your stalker.

42:28.513 --> 42:29.746
Be careful!

42:29.848 --> 42:30.513
- Yeah, Jake.

42:30.615 --> 42:31.915
Thank you.

42:32.017 --> 42:33.283
I really appreciate that.

42:33.385 --> 42:34.450
Sara's about to
       come over right now

42:34.553 --> 42:36.819
and we're gonna get
     ready to go to school.

42:36.922 --> 42:37.620
But, thank you.

42:37.722 --> 42:38.621
Yeah.

42:38.723 --> 42:39.622
- Is everything
       all right Chelsea?

42:39.724 --> 42:40.657
- No, yeah.

42:40.759 --> 42:42.191
Everything's great.
       (nervous laughs)

42:42.294 --> 42:44.394
I just gotta get
        ready for school.

42:44.496 --> 42:45.562
Hey, one more thing.

42:47.098 --> 42:47.897
One sec.

42:48.733 --> 42:49.666
(spray hissing)
         - Oh!

42:49.768 --> 42:53.736
(Chelsea choking and gasping)

42:54.973 --> 42:57.407
(door slams)

43:03.348 --> 43:05.582
(knocking)

43:05.684 --> 43:08.251
(dramatic music)

43:09.821 --> 43:12.322
(spray hissing)

43:26.638 --> 43:28.972
(Jake grunts)

43:32.344 --> 43:33.943
- She left me no choice.

43:41.319 --> 43:42.318
Where are you going?

43:45.323 --> 43:47.023
Looks like we're all
    going for a little ride.

43:58.903 --> 44:01.304
Yeah, I couldn't just
    leave her there, could I?

44:02.474 --> 44:03.940
She would have ruined our plans.

44:08.647 --> 44:09.646
(coughs)

44:09.748 --> 44:11.314
- Are you okay?

44:11.416 --> 44:13.650
You're experiencing the
     hallucinogenic effects

44:13.752 --> 44:16.085
of the same flowers
       in your bouquet.

44:16.187 --> 44:17.654
Angel's trumpets.

44:18.590 --> 44:19.322
It'll pass.

44:20.592 --> 44:21.357
- Uh!

44:30.068 --> 44:31.534
- Home, sweet home.

44:31.636 --> 44:33.036
That wasn't so bad, was it?

44:36.941 --> 44:39.609
(garage door motor whirring)

44:40.745 --> 44:43.446
(dramatic music)

44:47.352 --> 44:49.952
- You know I've been thinking

44:50.055 --> 44:52.055
and dreaming about this...

44:53.391 --> 44:55.491
...since the first
       time I saw you.

44:56.594 --> 44:58.461
(Chelsea whimpers)

44:58.563 --> 45:00.730
- I wanna get to know

45:00.832 --> 45:02.632
...everything about you.

45:05.804 --> 45:08.104
- Please, just let us go!

45:09.474 --> 45:11.808
We won't say anything
      you've done to us.

45:11.910 --> 45:14.043
I swear!
       - Shh sh sh sh sh.

45:16.281 --> 45:17.914
I'll leave you alone.

45:20.051 --> 45:21.551
But, I'll be back.

45:22.954 --> 45:25.521
(intense music)

45:25.623 --> 45:27.590
(knocking)

45:32.797 --> 45:35.998
(telephone ringing)

45:36.101 --> 45:36.799
- [Chelsea] Hey, what's up?

45:36.901 --> 45:38.134
This is Chelsea.

45:38.236 --> 45:39.168
Leave me a message and
   I'll get right back to you.

45:39.270 --> 45:40.002
(beeps)

45:40.105 --> 45:41.070
- Hey, it's me.

45:41.940 --> 45:43.072
Are you in the
      shower or something?

45:43.174 --> 45:44.373
I'm out front.

45:45.376 --> 45:46.242
- Hey, Eric.

45:46.344 --> 45:47.410
Is Chelsea not here?

45:47.512 --> 45:48.544
- [Eric] I don't know.

45:48.646 --> 45:49.612
I knocked on the door
      and I called her,

45:49.714 --> 45:51.114
but she's not
      picking up her phone.

45:51.216 --> 45:52.281
- That's strange.
        - Yeah.

45:52.383 --> 45:53.983
Her car is here.

45:54.085 --> 45:54.984
I was supposed to meet her

45:55.086 --> 45:56.419
and Sarah at the
       gym for a workout.

45:59.991 --> 46:01.491
Oh, It's unlocked.

46:02.327 --> 46:04.861
Chelsea, Eric's here.

46:06.898 --> 46:08.197
Chelsea?

46:08.299 --> 46:11.033
(suspenseful music)

46:11.136 --> 46:12.068
Chelsea?

46:13.838 --> 46:14.604
Honey?

46:16.307 --> 46:18.207
All of her stuff is here.

46:18.309 --> 46:19.609
I'm gonna go check
     the rest of the house.

46:19.711 --> 46:20.576
- Okay.

46:20.678 --> 46:21.611
- Chelsea?

46:21.713 --> 46:24.046
(footsteps)

46:25.283 --> 46:27.617
Well, her car is
        here, house keys.

46:27.719 --> 46:30.186
She never goes anywhere
     without her cell.

46:30.288 --> 46:30.920
It's strange Dean.

46:31.022 --> 46:32.054
I'm worried.

46:32.157 --> 46:33.823
- I wouldn't panic,
       honey, I mean,

46:33.925 --> 46:35.658
she's probably just
       out with friends.

46:36.995 --> 46:38.060
Check her social media pages,

46:38.163 --> 46:40.530
see if maybe she
        posted something.

46:40.632 --> 46:42.231
I'm almost wrapping up this job

46:42.333 --> 46:45.268
and I'll head over as
     soon as I'm done, okay?

46:45.370 --> 46:46.169
- [Beverly] Thank you, honey.

46:46.271 --> 46:46.836
- Okay.
      - I'll see you soon.

46:46.938 --> 46:51.374
- All right, bye.

46:52.510 --> 46:53.676
We can't seem to find Chelsea,

46:53.778 --> 46:55.178
so when you get this message,

46:55.280 --> 46:57.013
if you can call one of
    us back, that'd be great!

46:57.115 --> 46:58.147
Thanks.

46:59.918 --> 47:00.683
- Thanks, Eric.

47:03.288 --> 47:06.422
I hate to do this, but I
   think I'm gonna call Mila.

47:07.292 --> 47:08.691
- Hi, Beverly.

47:08.793 --> 47:09.926
No, she's not.

47:10.028 --> 47:10.827
What's going on?

47:12.030 --> 47:13.095
- We don't know.

47:13.198 --> 47:15.565
I'm at the house with
      her boyfriend Eric.

47:15.667 --> 47:19.502
- Okay, no, I haven't
      seen her today.

47:19.604 --> 47:22.839
- Mila, Chelsea left
   behind her keys, her phone,

47:22.941 --> 47:25.341
and her car is still here.

47:25.443 --> 47:26.676
- That's strange.

47:26.778 --> 47:28.945
I hope this doesn't have
     to do with her stalker.

47:30.348 --> 47:31.614
- Her what?

47:31.716 --> 47:34.283
- Yeah, she had some guy
   from online following her.

47:34.385 --> 47:36.352
He was watching her the
     other day at the park

47:36.454 --> 47:37.820
when they were filming there.

47:37.922 --> 47:39.555
He even left flowers on her car.

47:40.592 --> 47:42.458
- Mila, did he threaten
     her in any way?

47:45.330 --> 47:48.164
- He said that if she went to
  the police, she'd be sorry.

47:48.266 --> 47:50.266
- Well we need to
        go to the police.

47:52.170 --> 47:55.271
- Mrs. Bilson, there's
something else you should know.

47:55.373 --> 47:56.873
- What is it this time, Mila?

47:57.809 --> 47:59.775
- (scoffs) Okay, I deserve that.

48:00.745 --> 48:03.079
It's just that, this
      could be serious,

48:03.181 --> 48:04.547
and I really hope it's not.

48:04.649 --> 48:06.883
But, there was this one night
  where she was really upset

48:06.985 --> 48:08.784
about a boyfriend breakup up,

48:08.887 --> 48:11.888
and she was broke and she
    couldn't finish her film.

48:11.990 --> 48:15.024
So, I was just trying to help.

48:15.126 --> 48:16.192
- What'd you do, Mila?

48:17.095 --> 48:18.861
- I created a webcam
      channel for her.

48:19.831 --> 48:21.364
- A what?

48:21.466 --> 48:24.467
- I just was setting her up to
  make some extra money online.

48:24.569 --> 48:26.269
It's called Dahlia's
      Dream World.

48:27.472 --> 48:29.171
I'm sorry, Mrs. Bilson.

48:29.274 --> 48:31.440
(dramatic music)

48:31.542 --> 48:34.043
(computer bleeps)

48:34.145 --> 48:36.879
(computer dings)

48:38.283 --> 48:39.248
- There!

48:40.685 --> 48:43.419
(computer chimes)

48:54.899 --> 48:56.132
- [Chelsea] Hello?

48:56.234 --> 48:58.501
Is anybody here?

48:58.603 --> 48:59.502
Please.

48:59.604 --> 49:00.269
Sara!

49:00.371 --> 49:01.771
Sara are you here?

49:01.873 --> 49:03.005
- I'm here, Chelsea.

49:05.043 --> 49:06.876
- Are you okay?

49:06.978 --> 49:07.843
- I'm okay.

49:09.681 --> 49:10.346
- Help!

49:10.448 --> 49:13.382
- Keep your voices down!

49:19.357 --> 49:21.958
- No, No, Aah!

49:29.067 --> 49:31.000
- You need to shut up.

49:32.003 --> 49:33.736
Today is not your lucky day.

49:36.374 --> 49:39.642
Wrong place,

49:39.744 --> 49:40.509
wrong time.

49:41.379 --> 49:44.013
(muffled scream)

49:44.115 --> 49:45.514
- Unfortunately, I've
     seen this story before

49:45.616 --> 49:47.917
with the guy crossing
    the line into obsession.

49:48.019 --> 49:49.452
- What do you mean?

49:49.554 --> 49:51.053
- Well, sometimes they figure
 out how to track the girl down

49:51.155 --> 49:54.190
and then, who knows how
     far they'll take it?

49:54.292 --> 49:55.558
- Oh my God.

49:55.660 --> 49:56.826
- Now don't get me wrong,
    sometimes it's nothing.

49:56.928 --> 49:58.094
They're harmless.

49:58.196 --> 50:00.730
- But sometimes they're
     dangerous, right?

50:00.832 --> 50:03.032
- We need to deal
       with what we know.

50:03.134 --> 50:05.167
Have you seen her
      private web channel?

50:06.137 --> 50:07.636
- We were able to
      log into the website,

50:07.739 --> 50:10.072
but her channel has
      been deleted already.

50:10.942 --> 50:12.908
Do you think maybe you
   could get the site operator

50:13.011 --> 50:14.543
to give us information?

50:15.646 --> 50:16.946
- Legally, we can't.

50:17.048 --> 50:19.648
Chelsea's an adult, so no
    crime has been committed.

50:19.751 --> 50:21.684
The only way we can
      get more information

50:21.786 --> 50:23.686
is from the person
       who created it.

50:23.788 --> 50:25.254
- That's Mila.

50:25.356 --> 50:27.056
- And who's she?

50:27.158 --> 50:28.224
- Mila Walters.

50:28.326 --> 50:29.592
She's Chelsea's friend
     from high school.

50:29.694 --> 50:31.227
They reconnected a few weeks ago

50:31.329 --> 50:33.095
and she's the one who
      set up a web channel.

50:33.197 --> 50:33.896
- Okay great.

50:33.998 --> 50:35.164
I'm gonna need her number.

50:36.267 --> 50:38.601
Is there anyone else she
    may have met recently?

50:39.937 --> 50:40.636
- The movie.

50:40.738 --> 50:41.637
Her movie.

50:41.739 --> 50:44.940
Ah, maybe some new
       crew or extras?

50:46.944 --> 50:48.444
- What about that gym
      that you guys joined?

50:48.546 --> 50:50.079
- Yeah, the Metro Street Gym.

50:50.181 --> 50:51.714
The trainer's name
       is Jake Peters.

50:51.816 --> 50:52.515
We joined that.

50:52.617 --> 50:53.716
- Great.

50:55.053 --> 50:56.919
And you said that there
     was no sign of struggle

50:57.021 --> 50:58.554
in the house.

50:58.656 --> 51:00.022
Well, that tells me
     that she may have gone

51:00.124 --> 51:01.590
with someone that she knows.

51:03.161 --> 51:05.094
You said that she's been gone
  since 8:00 a.m. this morning?

51:05.196 --> 51:07.263
- That was the last
       time I saw her.

51:09.534 --> 51:11.600
- I know you didn't
      love your boyfriend.

51:11.702 --> 51:13.636
(Chelsea's breathing quickens)

51:13.738 --> 51:17.473
After all, he can't
      give you what I can.

51:22.480 --> 51:23.913
So I had to take care of him.

51:25.183 --> 51:27.650
- No, no! (muffled cries)

51:27.752 --> 51:29.785
- No, sweetheart, no.

51:29.887 --> 51:32.321
I promise, it was
        painless for him.

51:35.126 --> 51:37.760
Don't worry.
          (sobs)

51:37.862 --> 51:39.361
I didn't let him suffer.

51:39.464 --> 51:41.430
(imposing music)

51:48.005 --> 51:49.705
(upbeat dance music)
      (indistinct chatter)

51:49.807 --> 51:50.406
- [Liam] Hey, it's Liam.

51:50.508 --> 51:51.540
Do your thing.

51:52.743 --> 51:53.476
(telephone beeps)

51:53.578 --> 51:55.611
(sighs)

51:55.713 --> 51:56.679
- Of course!

52:01.185 --> 52:02.852
(keyboard clicking)

52:02.954 --> 52:05.287
(computer beeping)

52:06.124 --> 52:07.990
(location tracker beeping)

52:13.064 --> 52:15.464
(dramatic music)

52:15.566 --> 52:18.767
- [Navigation] In
      300 feet, turn right.

52:27.812 --> 52:29.979
You have reached
        your destination.

53:14.525 --> 53:17.293
(door creaking)

53:29.907 --> 53:31.807
(screams)

53:38.816 --> 53:43.419
- (sobbing) Oh Liam, oh Liam.

53:44.522 --> 53:47.590
(police siren wails)

53:56.667 --> 53:57.700
- Detective?

53:58.869 --> 54:01.136
Could I have a moment
      with Liam, alone?

54:02.840 --> 54:03.606
- Go ahead.

54:04.742 --> 54:05.507
- Thanks.

54:14.018 --> 54:18.120
(indistinct police
       radio chatter)

54:23.261 --> 54:26.061
(telephone chimes)

54:34.038 --> 54:35.104
- You done?

54:35.206 --> 54:37.072
- Yeah, thanks.

54:37.174 --> 54:38.707
- Miss Walters, a lot of
    bad things are happening

54:38.809 --> 54:40.809
to your friends and I
      can't help but think

54:40.911 --> 54:42.511
that you're somehow involved.

54:42.613 --> 54:43.946
- What?

54:44.048 --> 54:45.547
I didn't have anything to do
  with this or with Chelsea.

54:45.650 --> 54:46.482
- Why don't you come
      down to the office

54:46.584 --> 54:48.317
so I can ask you some questions.

54:48.419 --> 54:50.185
- Am I being charged
      with a crime?

54:51.088 --> 54:52.288
- No.

54:52.390 --> 54:53.522
Not yet.

54:53.624 --> 54:55.624
But, it would be in your
    best interest to comply.

54:55.726 --> 54:56.458
- I have a few errands
     to run this morning

54:56.560 --> 54:58.394
and then I'll come by after.

54:58.496 --> 54:59.261
Good enough?

55:00.364 --> 55:01.297
- Yup.

55:01.399 --> 55:02.398
See you there.

55:04.068 --> 55:04.967
- Detective?

55:05.069 --> 55:05.868
One more thing.

55:07.204 --> 55:08.003
- What is it?

55:10.141 --> 55:11.240
- This is Liam's phone.

55:12.476 --> 55:14.977
I used his thumb to open it and,

55:15.913 --> 55:19.048
this name and address was
  the first thing that came up.

55:19.150 --> 55:19.982
Do you know him?

55:20.985 --> 55:22.885
- Now you're tampering
     with evidence,

55:25.423 --> 55:26.355
and yes I do.

55:29.493 --> 55:31.694
- Are you awake, my angel?

55:34.999 --> 55:36.031
I wanna pamper you.

55:40.905 --> 55:42.604
I hope you're hungry.

55:46.711 --> 55:47.476
There.

55:52.016 --> 55:54.049
Now, I know that
     you're still accepting

55:54.151 --> 55:55.551
the loss of your boyfriend,

55:57.655 --> 56:00.456
but I know if you
        just let me in,

56:00.558 --> 56:01.924
you'll see how much I love you.

56:04.462 --> 56:07.463
I'm gonna trust you
      not to scream, okay?

56:10.034 --> 56:10.799
Yes?

56:17.375 --> 56:19.041
- You gotta stop with the tea.

56:20.378 --> 56:22.378
It's making me so sick.

56:24.048 --> 56:27.316
I'm nauseous, and
      my head is spinning.

56:30.755 --> 56:35.624
- Okay, but we've gotta trust
  each other for this to work.

56:40.831 --> 56:44.767
I know in time that you'll
   come to love me too.

56:44.869 --> 56:48.771
- (scoffs) You're a murderer.

56:50.074 --> 56:52.908
You're sick, and you need help!

56:57.415 --> 57:00.048
- I wish you wouldn't
      say things like that.

57:03.154 --> 57:06.088
(breathing heavily)

57:09.593 --> 57:11.026
- No.

57:11.128 --> 57:12.094
Please,

57:13.164 --> 57:13.896
don't.

57:16.400 --> 57:18.534
(grunts)

57:19.670 --> 57:23.005
- I'm gonna give you some
 time to rethink your feelings.

57:25.976 --> 57:27.075
(muffled cough)

57:27.178 --> 57:28.877
I've gotta go to the gym
    and pick some things up.

57:30.748 --> 57:32.047
I'll be right back.

57:36.320 --> 57:38.420
I'm gonna leave
       the TV on for you.

57:38.522 --> 57:40.422
(television audience cheering)

57:40.524 --> 57:41.490
Don't forget.

57:43.227 --> 57:44.393
(camera beeps)
      I'm always watching.

57:46.363 --> 57:47.696
(dramatic music)

57:47.798 --> 57:56.505
(telephone ringing)

57:56.607 --> 57:57.706
- Yeah?

57:57.808 --> 57:58.907
- [Woman] Jake, there's
     a Detective Morita here

57:59.009 --> 58:01.210
from the LAPD to see you.

58:01.312 --> 58:02.644
- Send him in.

58:02.746 --> 58:05.514
(telephone clatters)

58:08.953 --> 58:10.018
(knocking)

58:10.120 --> 58:11.019
- Hey.

58:11.121 --> 58:13.489
- Mr. Peters,
     Detective Morita, LAPD.

58:13.591 --> 58:16.124
You got a few minutes to
    answer some questions?

58:16.227 --> 58:17.159
- Sure.

58:17.261 --> 58:18.193
Please, have a seat.

58:20.698 --> 58:22.097
What's this about?

58:22.199 --> 58:25.000
- One of your new clients is
 Chelsea Bilson, she's missing.

58:25.102 --> 58:26.468
So we're asking
    everybody that's seen her

58:26.570 --> 58:29.538
in the last few days if they
  remember anything strange.

58:29.640 --> 58:30.939
- That's terrible.

58:31.041 --> 58:32.241
I ran into Chelsea

58:32.343 --> 58:35.244
at the Roosevelt Park
     Coffeehouse, yesterday.

58:36.514 --> 58:38.881
She said that she was
   waiting for her boyfriend.

58:38.983 --> 58:40.782
We spoke for a few
    minutes and then I left.

58:41.919 --> 58:43.719
- And what were you
       doing at the park?

58:43.821 --> 58:45.754
- I was meeting a
     client for a work out.

58:46.857 --> 58:48.423
- What was that client's name?

58:50.694 --> 58:51.493
- Chris Fields.

58:59.937 --> 59:01.970
(grunts)

59:07.211 --> 59:10.946
(breathing heavily)

59:11.048 --> 59:11.947
- [Reporter] We
       have breaking news

59:12.049 --> 59:13.715
from downtown Los Angeles.

59:13.817 --> 59:15.984
Early this morning a
    man's dead body was found

59:16.086 --> 59:17.686
in the dumpster behind me.

59:17.788 --> 59:19.488
He's been identified
      as 21 year old

59:19.590 --> 59:21.356
Liam Gregg of Los Angeles.

59:21.458 --> 59:23.392
A family spokesperson
    said they are devastated

59:23.494 --> 59:24.326
by the tragic news

59:24.428 --> 59:25.661
(grunting)
     and are at a loss as to

59:25.763 --> 59:27.596
who would do this to such
    a well liked young man.

59:27.698 --> 59:29.698
Police have no
      suspects at this time

59:29.800 --> 59:31.567
and they need the public's help.

59:31.669 --> 59:33.502
If you have any
    information, please call

59:33.604 --> 59:37.172
the LAPD Central Division
  and you can remain anonymous.

59:37.274 --> 59:38.807
Back to you in the studio.

59:38.909 --> 59:41.410
- And you've never
    contacted Chelsea online

59:41.512 --> 59:43.312
or sent her any flowers?

59:43.414 --> 59:44.212
- (laughs) No.

59:44.315 --> 59:46.548
No, I trained Chelsea twice here

59:46.650 --> 59:48.317
at the gym with her
       mother, Beverly.

59:50.187 --> 59:51.587
- Have you ever
        visited a website

59:51.689 --> 59:53.221
called Dahlia's Dream World?

59:54.224 --> 59:55.457
- Never heard of it.

59:55.559 --> 59:58.093
- It's a live webcam channel
  where men watch women.

59:59.129 --> 01:00:00.896
- (scoffs) Losers.

01:00:02.132 --> 01:00:04.900
No, it's it's not
      my thing, Detective.

01:00:05.002 --> 01:00:06.535
Can we pick this up
     another time, actually?

01:00:06.637 --> 01:00:08.704
I've got some clients
     that I need to get to.

01:00:08.806 --> 01:00:09.571
- Oh no that's,

01:00:10.908 --> 01:00:12.441
that's it for now. (chuckles)

01:00:12.543 --> 01:00:13.609
- [Jake] Great.

01:00:13.711 --> 01:00:15.143
- But, I appreciate
      your time Mr. Peters.

01:00:15.245 --> 01:00:16.078
- Of course.

01:00:17.448 --> 01:00:19.081
- If I have any other
  questions, can I contact you?

01:00:19.183 --> 01:00:19.881
- Yeah.

01:00:19.984 --> 01:00:20.882
Yeah, please do.

01:00:20.985 --> 01:00:22.417
- Thank you.
          - Take care.

01:00:22.519 --> 01:00:23.452
Thanks for coming by.

01:00:23.554 --> 01:00:26.521
- [Detective Morita]
      Yeah, thank you.

01:00:29.026 --> 01:00:30.058
- Detective?

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:31.460
Something you forgot?

01:00:31.562 --> 01:00:33.061
- Yes, one more question.

01:00:34.331 --> 01:00:36.732
Do you, know a, Liam Gregg?

01:00:38.135 --> 01:00:39.201
- Can't say that I do.

01:00:40.938 --> 01:00:42.471
- He was found dead this
    morning in a dumpster,

01:00:42.573 --> 01:00:45.173
and your name and address
    were the first thing

01:00:45.275 --> 01:00:46.808
we found on his phone.

01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:49.144
- Oh, that's too bad.

01:00:49.246 --> 01:00:50.512
No.

01:00:50.614 --> 01:00:53.148
I mean a lot of people
   have my name and my number.

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:54.683
I give out a lot of free
    memberships to people

01:00:54.785 --> 01:00:56.451
that I don't even know.

01:00:56.553 --> 01:00:57.953
It's just part of the
      business I'm in, so.

01:00:58.055 --> 01:00:59.655
- Thank you for your time.

01:00:59.757 --> 01:01:02.157
And we'll contact
       you if we need you.

01:01:03.093 --> 01:01:03.925
- Awesome.

01:01:04.028 --> 01:01:04.760
Thanks.

01:01:06.597 --> 01:01:09.531
(suspenseful music)

01:01:18.142 --> 01:01:20.375
(grunting)

01:01:29.053 --> 01:01:31.920
(struggling noises)

01:01:35.559 --> 01:01:38.293
(Chelsea gasping)

01:01:46.937 --> 01:01:47.669
- Sara!

01:01:48.605 --> 01:01:49.571
Sara.

01:01:51.675 --> 01:01:52.374
Wake up!

01:01:54.344 --> 01:01:55.310
Sara.

01:01:58.282 --> 01:02:00.449
(sobbing)

01:02:02.186 --> 01:02:02.951
Okay.

01:02:05.789 --> 01:02:07.089
(grunts)

01:02:07.191 --> 01:02:09.291
Okay, I'm gonna get us help.

01:02:14.565 --> 01:02:17.332
(door rattling)

01:02:17.434 --> 01:02:18.233
Help!

01:02:24.141 --> 01:02:27.075
(breathing heavily)

01:02:39.823 --> 01:02:42.491
(latch rattling)

01:02:44.394 --> 01:02:45.861
(gate creaking)

01:02:45.963 --> 01:02:48.130
Oh no! (muffled screams)

01:02:48.232 --> 01:02:50.165
- [Jake] Easy, easy!

01:02:50.267 --> 01:02:52.067
- [Dean] Okay, so I got the
   guys at work are gonna take

01:02:52.169 --> 01:02:53.935
all of these and put
       them in the trucks.

01:02:54.037 --> 01:02:55.771
- I'm gonna go to the
    cafe and the school first

01:02:55.873 --> 01:02:56.772
and start there.
       (cell phone buzzes)

01:02:56.874 --> 01:02:58.907
Oh, the Detective.

01:02:59.009 --> 01:03:00.609
Hi, Detective.

01:03:00.711 --> 01:03:01.643
Hi Mrs. Bilson.

01:03:01.745 --> 01:03:03.311
Yes, I interviewed
       Jake at the gym

01:03:03.413 --> 01:03:06.148
and he says he doesn't know
  anything about what happened.

01:03:06.250 --> 01:03:07.549
But, here's the
       interesting thing.

01:03:07.651 --> 01:03:09.551
I ran his name through the
   national criminal database

01:03:09.653 --> 01:03:11.286
and he's been a busy guy.

01:03:11.388 --> 01:03:13.555
Yeah, he was arrested
      twice for battery,

01:03:13.657 --> 01:03:15.357
served six months for
      domestic violence,

01:03:15.459 --> 01:03:17.325
and has a restraining order.

01:03:17.427 --> 01:03:19.427
Then a year ago he was released
from a mental institution

01:03:19.530 --> 01:03:21.296
to the care of his mother.

01:03:21.398 --> 01:03:24.166
Then his mother
      died, shortly after.

01:03:24.268 --> 01:03:27.068
She fell down the stairs of
their house and broke her neck.

01:03:27.171 --> 01:03:28.837
Terrible accident, I'd say.

01:03:28.939 --> 01:03:29.704
- Wow.

01:03:31.008 --> 01:03:33.041
I just never would
       have expected.

01:03:33.143 --> 01:03:34.142
That's really disturbing.

01:03:35.045 --> 01:03:36.311
So what do you think?

01:03:36.413 --> 01:03:38.980
Does it put us anywhere
   closer to finding Chelsea?

01:03:39.082 --> 01:03:40.382
- I'm afraid it doesn't.

01:03:40.484 --> 01:03:43.752
I don't have the evidence
  to prove that he's involved.

01:03:43.854 --> 01:03:44.619
But,

01:03:45.923 --> 01:03:46.721
I'll keep looking.

01:03:46.824 --> 01:03:48.590
- What about the website?

01:03:49.526 --> 01:03:51.660
- We're still trying to get
   the owners to cooperate.

01:03:51.762 --> 01:03:53.795
They're being difficult
     about giving us access.

01:03:53.897 --> 01:03:56.097
I'm pushing the judge
      to give us a warrant.

01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:57.365
- Thank you, Detective.

01:03:59.169 --> 01:04:00.468
(dramatic music)

01:04:00.571 --> 01:04:02.771
(Dean sighs)

01:04:05.008 --> 01:04:08.043
(telephone clatters)

01:04:12.616 --> 01:04:13.348
- Stop moving.

01:04:17.554 --> 01:04:19.754
(knocking)

01:04:19.857 --> 01:04:22.657
(muffled scream)
        Not a sound.

01:04:22.759 --> 01:04:25.026
(knocking)

01:04:25.128 --> 01:04:26.294
Yeah?

01:04:26.396 --> 01:04:28.930
- Oh, hey, hey Jake,
    it's Bill, your neighbor.

01:04:29.032 --> 01:04:31.466
I wanted to return
      your mom's lawnmower.

01:04:31.568 --> 01:04:33.768
- Hey now's a really bad time.

01:04:33.871 --> 01:04:35.403
Any chance you
      could drop by later?

01:04:35.505 --> 01:04:36.671
Drop it off?

01:04:36.773 --> 01:04:39.474
- I can't, Jake, I've
     gotta drop it off now.

01:04:39.576 --> 01:04:41.543
I'm heading out of
       town later tonight.

01:04:41.645 --> 01:04:42.611
It's in the back of my truck.

01:04:42.713 --> 01:04:43.411
I need need your help.

01:04:43.513 --> 01:04:44.579
I'm really sorry.

01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:47.816
- Not a sound.

01:04:50.921 --> 01:04:51.920
Sure, Bill.

01:04:52.022 --> 01:04:52.787
I'll be right out.

01:04:54.558 --> 01:04:55.490
I'll be right back.

01:04:59.663 --> 01:05:00.662
Hah! (grunts)
          (thuds)

01:05:00.764 --> 01:05:03.665
(muffled screaming)

01:05:13.143 --> 01:05:15.744
(door latches)

01:05:15.846 --> 01:05:17.012
Looks like it's time to go.

01:05:22.886 --> 01:05:26.688
(muffled grunting)

01:05:26.790 --> 01:05:28.156
It's the end of
        the road for you.

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:31.393
Like I said.

01:05:31.495 --> 01:05:33.662
Wrong place, wrong time.

01:05:33.764 --> 01:05:35.730
(muffled screams)

01:05:37.134 --> 01:05:38.600
(thump)

01:05:41.305 --> 01:05:42.103
- [Chelsea] Eek!

01:05:42.205 --> 01:05:43.571
This one's for you, Mom!

01:05:43.674 --> 01:05:45.540
Thank you. (laughs)

01:05:45.642 --> 01:05:47.609
(sighs)

01:05:51.014 --> 01:05:52.280
- What is that?

01:05:57.587 --> 01:05:58.553
Hmm.

01:06:00.157 --> 01:06:01.823
Fitness Life Nutrition.

01:06:02.893 --> 01:06:05.593
(keyboard clicking)

01:06:05.696 --> 01:06:08.496
Jake Peters, Metro Street Gym.

01:06:10.934 --> 01:06:15.003
Sued by investors?
      (telephone vibrates)

01:06:16.039 --> 01:06:17.072
Hey, Beverly.

01:06:17.174 --> 01:06:18.340
- Hi, do you have anything?

01:06:18.442 --> 01:06:20.408
- I found this protein
    label and, and get this.

01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:22.711
It comes from Fitness
      Life Nutrition.

01:06:22.813 --> 01:06:25.647
I found out that Jake Peters
   actually runs that company.

01:06:25.749 --> 01:06:26.982
- Uh huh?

01:06:27.084 --> 01:06:28.650
- Apparently he went
  bankrupt like two months ago,

01:06:28.752 --> 01:06:30.518
and now all of his investors
  are trying to sue him

01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:32.020
for fraud and embezzlement.

01:06:32.122 --> 01:06:33.021
- Interesting.

01:06:33.123 --> 01:06:33.788
Wow.

01:06:33.890 --> 01:06:35.323
This guy is a nightmare.

01:06:35.425 --> 01:06:37.292
The detective
      interviewed him too.

01:06:37.394 --> 01:06:39.894
I'll tell her about this,
  but could you just stay there

01:06:39.997 --> 01:06:41.896
in case she calls or comes home,

01:06:41.999 --> 01:06:43.898
and just call us if you
   have any other news, okay?

01:06:44.001 --> 01:06:45.033
- Yeah, thing is though,

01:06:45.135 --> 01:06:46.234
(phone beeps)
   his warehouse is downtown.

01:06:46.336 --> 01:06:48.203
(busy tone beeps)
    So, I got this idea that.

01:06:48.305 --> 01:06:49.604
Hello?

01:06:49.706 --> 01:06:50.772
Bev, hel.

01:06:50.874 --> 01:06:52.173
(telephone beeps)

01:06:52.275 --> 01:06:52.974
- [Dean] Any news?

01:06:53.076 --> 01:06:54.342
- I don't know.

01:06:54.444 --> 01:06:56.978
Something about Jake's
  company going out of business

01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:58.046
a couple of months ago.

01:07:00.017 --> 01:07:02.050
This guy's starting
     to look really guilty.

01:07:03.587 --> 01:07:04.853
Which, we need to find
     something concrete

01:07:04.955 --> 01:07:06.421
or we're not gonna find her.

01:07:17.601 --> 01:07:19.300
(telephone vibrates)

01:07:19.403 --> 01:07:20.101
Oh it's Mila.

01:07:20.203 --> 01:07:21.403
Hey, Mila.

01:07:21.505 --> 01:07:22.504
Anything new?

01:07:22.606 --> 01:07:24.339
- Hi Mrs. Bilson.

01:07:24.441 --> 01:07:28.276
Yeah, my friend Liam, he was
  tracking that website guy,

01:07:28.378 --> 01:07:29.177
twoplates40.

01:07:29.279 --> 01:07:29.911
- Yeah.

01:07:30.013 --> 01:07:31.012
Yeah, what did he find?

01:07:31.114 --> 01:07:32.647
- I'm not really sure.

01:07:32.749 --> 01:07:35.050
Liam was found
       dead this morning.

01:07:35.152 --> 01:07:35.784
- Oh my God.

01:07:35.886 --> 01:07:37.052
Are you okay?

01:07:37.154 --> 01:07:38.520
That's horrible.

01:07:38.622 --> 01:07:39.788
- I'm okay, thanks.

01:07:41.258 --> 01:07:43.658
But, when I opened his phone,
  I found the contact info

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:44.859
for what I think may have been

01:07:44.961 --> 01:07:46.694
the guy from the website.

01:07:46.797 --> 01:07:48.930
It's some guy named Jake Peters.

01:07:49.032 --> 01:07:50.098
I gave it to Detective Morita

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:52.067
and she said she'd
       follow up with him.

01:07:52.169 --> 01:07:53.935
- Jake Peters?

01:07:54.037 --> 01:07:55.770
Wait, she didn't say
       anything about Jake

01:07:55.872 --> 01:07:57.639
being on the website.

01:07:57.741 --> 01:07:59.574
- Oh, she doesn't know
     that it's for sure him,

01:07:59.676 --> 01:08:01.543
but Liam had been
       hacking the website

01:08:01.645 --> 01:08:04.446
and matching up the usernames
  with credit card info.

01:08:04.548 --> 01:08:07.515
All I know is that when I
 opened his phone this morning,

01:08:07.617 --> 01:08:10.385
I saw the address and
      the name of that guy.

01:08:10.487 --> 01:08:11.820
I can't be sure he's the one.

01:08:12.889 --> 01:08:15.323
- Would you please
      text me that address?

01:08:15.425 --> 01:08:16.224
Thank you, Mila.

01:08:17.294 --> 01:08:18.693
And I am so sorry
       about your friend.

01:08:23.966 --> 01:08:24.765
It's him!

01:08:24.868 --> 01:08:25.600
- [Dean] Who?

01:08:25.702 --> 01:08:26.801
- Jake was the one on line.

01:08:26.903 --> 01:08:27.569
I know it!

01:08:27.671 --> 01:08:28.368
The gym guy?

01:08:28.471 --> 01:08:29.237
- Yes, the gym guy.

01:08:30.107 --> 01:08:32.006
She's texting me the address.

01:08:32.908 --> 01:08:33.808
Okay, here we go.

01:08:33.910 --> 01:08:34.642
Turn around.

01:08:35.812 --> 01:08:36.911
- You don't see that

01:08:37.013 --> 01:08:38.212
I'm the only one who
      really cares for you.

01:08:39.582 --> 01:08:41.716
I will never let you
      down like the others.

01:08:41.818 --> 01:08:43.718
I'll take care of you.

01:08:43.819 --> 01:08:46.287
You're gonna love the
    life that I give to you.

01:08:46.389 --> 01:08:47.354
You're gonna love me.

01:08:48.625 --> 01:08:51.759
(rattling)
        (muffled moaning)

01:08:51.862 --> 01:08:54.863
(car engine revving)

01:08:57.466 --> 01:08:59.533
(car doors slamming)

01:09:00.703 --> 01:09:02.303
(door knob rattles)

01:09:02.872 --> 01:09:04.104
(knocking)

01:09:04.207 --> 01:09:04.906
- [Beverly] Hello?

01:09:05.008 --> 01:09:05.740
Chelsea?

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:09.109
Chelsea, it's Mom.

01:09:09.212 --> 01:09:10.778
Are you in there?

01:09:10.881 --> 01:09:12.147
- [Sara] Help!

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:14.149
Help me!
    - Did you hear something?

01:09:14.251 --> 01:09:14.948
- Help!
            - I did.

01:09:15.051 --> 01:09:16.317
- [Sara] Help!

01:09:16.419 --> 01:09:19.287
- Let's go around the back.
   - Help!

01:09:28.098 --> 01:09:29.197
- Oh my God!

01:09:29.299 --> 01:09:32.567
(door rattling)

01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:34.068
Oh my God!

01:09:34.171 --> 01:09:34.903
- Oh my God!

01:09:36.238 --> 01:09:36.871
Sara!

01:09:36.973 --> 01:09:38.939
(gasping)

01:09:39.042 --> 01:09:40.808
(door sliding)
         - It's open.

01:09:40.911 --> 01:09:41.943
- [Beverly] Sara!

01:09:43.113 --> 01:09:44.511
- [Dean] I'll check
     that rest of the house.

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:46.214
- Sweetheart, are you okay?

01:09:46.316 --> 01:09:48.116
- My head just really hurts.

01:09:48.218 --> 01:09:49.716
- What happened?

01:09:49.819 --> 01:09:51.386
- He sprayed me with something.

01:09:51.488 --> 01:09:52.453
It knocked me out.

01:09:52.555 --> 01:09:53.520
It's disgusting.

01:09:53.622 --> 01:09:54.656
- Is Chelsea here?

01:09:56.092 --> 01:09:59.160
- I don't know, I don't,
 Chelsea was, Chelsea was here.

01:09:59.262 --> 01:10:00.662
- There's no one here now.

01:10:00.764 --> 01:10:01.629
Who's this?

01:10:01.731 --> 01:10:02.397
- I don't know.

01:10:02.499 --> 01:10:04.098
I was knocked out.

01:10:07.504 --> 01:10:08.870
- My God, this guy's dead.

01:10:10.273 --> 01:10:11.272
- We have to call the police,

01:10:11.374 --> 01:10:12.574
and we have to get
      you to the hospital.

01:10:12.676 --> 01:10:13.508
- [Sara] Okay, thanks.

01:10:13.610 --> 01:10:14.909
- Oh, Eric texted.

01:10:15.011 --> 01:10:17.078
He's gonna Jake's warehouse
   and he sent the address.

01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:18.179
We should go.

01:10:19.115 --> 01:10:20.215
We can call the
       police on the way.

01:10:20.317 --> 01:10:21.015
Are you okay?

01:10:21.117 --> 01:10:22.016
- Yeah, Im fine.

01:10:22.118 --> 01:10:23.484
I'm, I'll be fine.

01:10:23.587 --> 01:10:26.087
I'm feeling better, I just,
   I wanna get away from here.

01:10:26.189 --> 01:10:26.888
- Of course.

01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:28.456
Come on.

01:10:30.894 --> 01:10:31.993
- Help!

01:10:32.796 --> 01:10:35.129
Someone help me please!

01:10:35.232 --> 01:10:36.297
- Help me!

01:10:40.003 --> 01:10:42.370
Sweetheart, there's nobody here.

01:10:42.472 --> 01:10:43.938
It's just you and me.

01:10:45.775 --> 01:10:47.208
- Please!

01:10:47.811 --> 01:10:49.711
Somebody!

01:10:52.349 --> 01:10:53.081
- Listen,

01:10:55.852 --> 01:10:56.918
don't be upset.

01:10:57.921 --> 01:10:59.420
We'll be out of here soon.

01:10:59.522 --> 01:11:01.422
You can rest on the
       way to the cabin.

01:11:01.524 --> 01:11:02.624
Alright?

01:11:02.726 --> 01:11:04.425
(grunting and sobbing)

01:11:04.527 --> 01:11:06.494
We're gonna have a
      great life together.

01:11:07.731 --> 01:11:08.429
You'll see.

01:11:09.866 --> 01:11:11.099
We can live off the grid.

01:11:12.402 --> 01:11:14.369
Make our own little
       secret garden.

01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:25.580
(car door slams)
        - Stay inside.

01:11:25.682 --> 01:11:27.181
Lock the doors.

01:11:27.284 --> 01:11:28.983
Alright, the ambulance
     is on its way.

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:33.154
(car door slams)

01:11:33.256 --> 01:11:34.589
- This could be his truck.

01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:44.565
That's Chelsea's slipper.

01:11:47.704 --> 01:11:49.304
- The engine's still warm.

01:11:49.406 --> 01:11:50.838
Alright, they haven't
      been here long.

01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:51.606
That door's locked.

01:11:51.708 --> 01:11:52.407
Let's check around back.

01:11:52.509 --> 01:11:53.341
- It's gonna be dark soon.

01:11:53.443 --> 01:11:54.776
I'm calling the detective.

01:11:59.249 --> 01:12:02.250
(telephone ringing)

01:12:03.153 --> 01:12:03.918
- Mrs. Bilson?

01:12:05.221 --> 01:12:06.120
- Hello, detective?

01:12:06.222 --> 01:12:06.988
Hi.

01:12:08.091 --> 01:12:09.257
- I'm sorry you're breaking up.

01:12:09.359 --> 01:12:10.258
- Wait, hello?

01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:12.060
I think we have
        a bad connection.

01:12:12.162 --> 01:12:12.827
- No, say that again.

01:12:12.929 --> 01:12:14.262
You're, ah.

01:12:14.364 --> 01:12:16.030
- Well, we think we found
  Chelsea and she's with Jake.

01:12:16.132 --> 01:12:17.031
I'm gonna text you the address.

01:12:17.133 --> 01:12:18.366
I hope you can hear this.

01:12:18.468 --> 01:12:19.667
- What?

01:12:19.769 --> 01:12:21.169
- Oh, God!

01:12:23.373 --> 01:12:25.807
(typing - sends text)

01:12:28.611 --> 01:12:29.410
Anything?

01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:31.346
Here, help me with this.

01:12:31.448 --> 01:12:32.480
I think we can get it.

01:12:33.450 --> 01:12:36.117
- Wha?
       (telephone bleeps)

01:12:36.219 --> 01:12:39.187
We have a hostage situation.

01:12:39.289 --> 01:12:39.921
I'll lift, you pull.

01:12:40.023 --> 01:12:40.988
- I'm trying.

01:12:41.091 --> 01:12:42.690
(grunts)
            Okay.

01:12:42.792 --> 01:12:43.458
Ah!

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:44.459
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:12:46.029 --> 01:12:48.296
(muffled screaming)

01:12:48.398 --> 01:12:49.130
- Oh my God!

01:12:49.232 --> 01:12:49.931
Where did you come from?

01:12:50.033 --> 01:12:51.232
- I was upstairs.

01:12:51.334 --> 01:12:53.334
I was able to pry this
   off and get the door open.

01:12:57.107 --> 01:12:59.640
- Don't do anything that's
   gonna make me hurt you.

01:13:05.515 --> 01:13:07.615
(footsteps)

01:13:09.119 --> 01:13:10.518
- I came through this
    tunnel and looked inside,

01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:12.854
but I didn't really
       see anything.

01:13:14.124 --> 01:13:15.423
Looks pretty empty to me.

01:13:22.999 --> 01:13:23.998
- It's a lot of space.

01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:25.533
I think we should split up.

01:13:25.635 --> 01:13:28.469
- Yeah, we have to be careful,
 this guy is dangerous.

01:13:28.571 --> 01:13:30.037
- I'm gonna see if I can
    find the breaker box.

01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:31.539
I think if I could
       shut the power off

01:13:31.641 --> 01:13:33.508
I might be able
       to flush Jake out.

01:13:33.610 --> 01:13:35.910
- We can go this way, to see
if there's any sign of Chelsea.

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:38.713
- Okay then, I'm
       gonna go with Eric,

01:13:38.815 --> 01:13:40.782
and you, if you see
      him just stay hidden.

01:13:40.884 --> 01:13:43.117
Okay, we just gotta
      make sure she's okay.

01:13:43.219 --> 01:13:44.085
- Right.

01:13:44.187 --> 01:13:44.852
- Be careful.

01:13:44.954 --> 01:13:45.853
- Be safe.

01:14:26.863 --> 01:14:29.063
(thuds)
           (grunting)

01:14:29.165 --> 01:14:31.466
(clattering)

01:14:31.568 --> 01:14:32.433
- Okay, wait here.

01:14:32.535 --> 01:14:34.469
Wait here.
        - No Eric, stop.

01:14:40.877 --> 01:14:43.511
(grunting)

01:14:43.613 --> 01:14:45.780
(gagging)

01:14:52.322 --> 01:14:54.589
(rattling)

01:15:02.632 --> 01:15:03.397
(grunts)

01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:06.200
(thuds)
             - Ah!

01:15:06.302 --> 01:15:07.568
- Eric.

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:08.436
Eric!

01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:13.040
(rattling)

01:15:13.142 --> 01:15:14.375
Mom!

01:15:14.477 --> 01:15:15.743
Mom, I'm in here!

01:15:20.049 --> 01:15:22.283
(rattling)

01:15:28.958 --> 01:15:31.025
(grunts)

01:15:38.301 --> 01:15:40.034
(rapid footsteps)

01:15:40.136 --> 01:15:40.902
- Chelsea!

01:15:46.876 --> 01:15:47.675
- Mom!

01:15:56.486 --> 01:15:57.718
- Chelsea, Chelsea!

01:15:57.820 --> 01:15:58.586
- [Jake] Don't move!

01:15:58.688 --> 01:15:59.353
- Okay.

01:15:59.455 --> 01:16:00.388
Okay, I stopped.

01:16:00.490 --> 01:16:01.622
Just don't hurt her.

01:16:01.724 --> 01:16:02.423
- Hurt her?

01:16:03.593 --> 01:16:05.426
I don't wanna hurt her.

01:16:06.296 --> 01:16:07.595
You're making me hurt her.

01:16:09.399 --> 01:16:11.966
All of this is happening
     because of your mother.

01:16:13.169 --> 01:16:15.002
We were gonna have
       a life together.

01:16:16.506 --> 01:16:17.939
You've ruined everything!

01:16:19.442 --> 01:16:21.242
- Jake, you don't
        have to do this.

01:16:21.344 --> 01:16:22.276
- But, I do.

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:25.313
I'm not goin' back.

01:16:26.983 --> 01:16:27.782
The torture.

01:16:28.885 --> 01:16:29.850
And the drugs.

01:16:31.187 --> 01:16:32.219
And their talk.

01:16:34.223 --> 01:16:36.223
The voices never stop
      when I'm in there!

01:16:37.794 --> 01:16:38.492
- Mom, stop.

01:16:38.595 --> 01:16:39.327
Be careful!

01:16:39.429 --> 01:16:41.195
- Chelsea, it's gonna be okay.

01:16:41.297 --> 01:16:42.563
- Why, huh?

01:16:42.665 --> 01:16:43.931
Why is is gonna be okay?

01:16:44.767 --> 01:16:46.901
Because mommy's gonna save her?

01:16:47.003 --> 01:16:48.202
- Jake, listen to me.

01:16:48.304 --> 01:16:49.704
- You're a horrible mother!

01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:53.841
You're coldhearted, and you're
 loveless, and you're cruel.

01:16:54.877 --> 01:16:57.645
How could a mother be
      so cruel to her son?

01:16:57.747 --> 01:16:59.614
- Jake, don't you mean daughter?

01:16:59.716 --> 01:17:00.815
- I know what I said.

01:17:00.917 --> 01:17:02.283
(Chelsea gasps)

01:17:02.385 --> 01:17:04.385
I'm not gonna let you stand
   in the way of my happiness.

01:17:04.487 --> 01:17:05.720
I'm not.

01:17:05.822 --> 01:17:06.921
You're gonna see.

01:17:07.023 --> 01:17:09.457
Everybody's gonna see,
    that love is the answer.

01:17:09.559 --> 01:17:11.392
Okay, you just don't
     understand like we do.

01:17:11.494 --> 01:17:12.393
Okay.

01:17:12.495 --> 01:17:13.294
Right, right?

01:17:13.396 --> 01:17:14.595
We understand, right Chelsea?

01:17:14.697 --> 01:17:16.864
- Jake, let's talk
       this through then.

01:17:16.966 --> 01:17:19.166
Let's just talk this through.

01:17:19.268 --> 01:17:21.502
You love her, right?

01:17:21.604 --> 01:17:23.104
You don't wanna hurt her.

01:17:23.206 --> 01:17:24.372
You don't want to
       hurt anyone, right?

01:17:24.474 --> 01:17:27.842
- I want you to
     apologize, for being a,

01:17:27.944 --> 01:17:29.176
for being a bad mother.

01:17:30.513 --> 01:17:31.579
- Apologize?

01:17:31.681 --> 01:17:33.814
- I want you to apologize now!

01:17:33.916 --> 01:17:35.850
Apologize or I'll hurt her,
  and it'll be all your fault!

01:17:35.952 --> 01:17:36.851
- Okay, okay.

01:17:36.953 --> 01:17:38.319
I will right now.

01:17:38.421 --> 01:17:42.523
I'm sorry, Chelsea, I am so
sorry for not being a good mom.

01:17:42.625 --> 01:17:43.290
- Keep going.

01:17:43.393 --> 01:17:44.759
Say the words!

01:17:44.861 --> 01:17:47.595
- Chelsea, I mean it when I
  say that it's not your fault.

01:17:50.633 --> 01:17:53.234
If I had done better you
 wouldn't be in this situation.

01:17:53.336 --> 01:17:54.435
You would be safe at home.

01:17:54.537 --> 01:17:55.670
- [Jake] No, keep going!

01:17:56.639 --> 01:17:57.571
- It's my fault.

01:18:00.843 --> 01:18:01.776
You deserve better.

01:18:03.279 --> 01:18:06.080
And I'm really sorry that I put
you in a position like this.

01:18:06.182 --> 01:18:07.782
I'm sorry that I pushed
     you into something

01:18:07.884 --> 01:18:09.116
that you didn't want to do.

01:18:11.087 --> 01:18:12.520
- Mom, stop!

01:18:14.123 --> 01:18:15.723
- And Jake, if you
      want to hurt someone,

01:18:15.825 --> 01:18:17.324
hurt me, not Chelsea.

01:18:18.995 --> 01:18:20.528
I deserve it, and not her.

01:18:22.532 --> 01:18:23.764
- You're right.

01:18:25.101 --> 01:18:27.868
You're right, you do deserve it.

01:18:27.970 --> 01:18:29.937
She's perfect and
        it's your fault.

01:18:30.039 --> 01:18:30.905
- Aah!
             - Aah!

01:18:31.007 --> 01:18:33.207
(grunts)

01:18:33.309 --> 01:18:34.542
- [Jake] Chelsea!

01:18:34.644 --> 01:18:35.376
- Aah!

01:18:36.546 --> 01:18:37.278
- Ow!

01:18:38.114 --> 01:18:38.846
- [Chelsea] Mom!

01:18:38.948 --> 01:18:40.314
- [Beverly] Run, oh my God!

01:18:40.416 --> 01:18:41.348
- Oh my God!

01:18:42.752 --> 01:18:44.218
(police siren wails)

01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:47.221
(gunshot fires)
         - Gah!

01:18:48.791 --> 01:18:49.523
- Are you okay?

01:18:49.625 --> 01:18:50.458
Oh God.

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:51.759
Are you okay?

01:18:51.861 --> 01:18:55.096
(helicopter circling)

01:18:59.836 --> 01:19:01.035
- [Beverly] That's good.

01:19:01.137 --> 01:19:03.671
So, I'm so happy that
   things are good with Eric!

01:19:03.773 --> 01:19:05.339
- Yeah, me too.

01:19:05.441 --> 01:19:08.375
I mean, it took a long time,
but I'm finally not so on edge.

01:19:08.478 --> 01:19:11.278
- Good, because you can't
    control what happened.

01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:13.614
- Yeah, I'm starting to
     realize that. (laughs)

01:19:13.716 --> 01:19:16.250
- What we need to do is
     focus on our studies,

01:19:16.352 --> 01:19:17.618
and get our degrees.

01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:20.421
- You mean, (laughs) my
     studies and my degree?

01:19:20.523 --> 01:19:22.256
- No, I mean we.

01:19:22.358 --> 01:19:23.591
- Mom, you're going
       back to college?

01:19:23.693 --> 01:19:25.559
- I'm going back to
       finish my degree.

01:19:25.661 --> 01:19:26.360
- You're serious?

01:19:26.462 --> 01:19:27.595
- Yeah.

01:19:27.697 --> 01:19:28.796
'Cause you know I thought
    we could hang out,

01:19:28.898 --> 01:19:30.664
do the college thing together.

01:19:30.767 --> 01:19:31.398
- Oh my gosh.

01:19:31.501 --> 01:19:32.800
Did you join a sorority?

01:19:32.902 --> 01:19:35.703
- Very funny.
          (laughs)

01:19:35.805 --> 01:19:37.171
- Well, I'm proud of you.

01:19:37.273 --> 01:19:39.373
- Hey, actually I'll tutor you.

01:19:39.475 --> 01:19:40.141
You just have to pay me.

01:19:40.243 --> 01:19:41.809
- Oh really?

01:19:41.911 --> 01:19:42.643
Maybe you're gonna be the one

01:19:42.745 --> 01:19:43.978
that has to keep up with me!

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:46.814
(laughing)

01:19:46.916 --> 01:19:49.316
(serene music)

01:19:52.421 --> 01:19:54.922
(birds chirping)
