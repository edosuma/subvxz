00:00.055 --> 00:01.403
<i>So here's what you missed</i>
<i>on Glee.</i>

00:01.425 --> 00:03.446
<i>It's springtime in the longest</i>
<i>year ever at McKinley</i>

00:03.468 --> 00:04.606
<i>And it's almost time</i>
<i>for graduation.</i>

00:04.630 --> 00:06.283
<i>Sue's principal</i>
<i>and Becky's her Beckretary,</i>

00:06.300 --> 00:07.281
<i>Get out, bitch!</i>

00:07.308 --> 00:08.386
<i>Which is good</i>
<i>because Becky made it clear</i>

00:08.404 --> 00:09.791
<i>She doesn't ever want</i>
<i>to leave McKinley.</i>

00:09.809 --> 00:11.993
<i>Jake cheated on Marley</i>
<i>with demon hellspawn Bree</i>

00:12.011 --> 00:13.451
<i>And he, like,</i>
<i>didn't even say "I'm sorry"</i>

00:13.469 --> 00:14.776
<i>Which totally hit Marley</i>
<i>like a ton of bricks</i>

00:14.794 --> 00:15.899
<i>That she broke through</i>
<i>with a wrecking ball.</i>

00:15.916 --> 00:16.597
<i>Say what?</i>

00:16.614 --> 00:18.497
<i>And that's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> Glee.

00:30.419 --> 00:33.490
Hey, Sue, you mind telling me
what's going on around here?

00:33.523 --> 00:34.818
Why, it is the First Annual

00:34.859 --> 00:36.490
McKinley High Career Fair.

00:36.523 --> 00:39.201
Where students come to expose
themselves to the job market

00:39.234 --> 00:41.948
and its entry-level
corporate recruiters.

00:41.989 --> 00:45.060
Who we hope, in turn,
do not, (chuckles)

00:45.101 --> 00:46.969
well, expose themselves
to our students.

00:47.002 --> 00:48.461
But Sue, these jobs
are-are terrible.

00:48.494 --> 00:49.767
It' not the '90s
anymore, William.

00:49.808 --> 00:52.618
When any high-school
dropout could stumble his way

00:52.652 --> 00:55.515
into a six-figure salary
as COO of a dotcom startup.

00:55.548 --> 00:58.658
Upon graduation,
our students will be entering

00:58.691 --> 01:00.735
the most competitive job market
in recent history.

01:00.776 --> 01:02.547
But Sue, the thing
that disturbs me

01:02.580 --> 01:06.042
is I don't see a booth
theater or music or dance.

01:06.075 --> 01:07.441
There is nothing here

01:07.475 --> 01:08.841
representing a career
in the arts!

01:08.874 --> 01:10.105
Well, that's because there's
no such thing

01:10.146 --> 01:11.381
as a career in the arts.

01:11.414 --> 01:14.157
William, I will not encourage
members of this student body

01:14.190 --> 01:16.589
to further endanger their
already uncertain futures

01:16.622 --> 01:20.503
in the unrealistic and
narcissistic pursuit of stardom

01:20.536 --> 01:22.577
when the very best
they're likely to achieve

01:22.610 --> 01:24.178
is coaching a
high school Glee Club

01:24.219 --> 01:25.877
and marrying a redheaded
googly-eyed homo afarensis

01:25.910 --> 01:29.283
with early-onset-dressing-
like-an-old lady disorder.

01:29.316 --> 01:31.816
Not gonna do it.
However, if you would like

01:31.849 --> 01:34.317
to set up a stool in between
Salad Artistry

01:34.358 --> 01:38.108
and... Fecal Sculpture,

01:38.141 --> 01:39.980
well, you're more than welcome

01:40.013 --> 01:41.420
to regale passersby

01:41.453 --> 01:43.953
with your inspiring story of how
you dreamt of Broadway stardom

01:43.986 --> 01:45.955
and ended up rapping
for high schoolers

01:45.988 --> 01:46.957
with a head of hair
that looks just

01:46.990 --> 01:49.267
like Olympia Dukakis's merkin.

01:53.141 --> 01:55.839
Hey, guys, in spite
of the complete lack

01:55.872 --> 01:57.607
of representation
at the Career Fair,

01:57.640 --> 01:58.744
I know that a lot of you
are thinking

01:58.777 --> 02:00.275
about a career in the arts.

02:00.316 --> 02:01.885
Well, it's no secret that
Sue Sylvester doesn't believe

02:01.918 --> 02:04.298
that an artistic career
is a very practical idea.

02:04.327 --> 02:06.565
And, for once,
I have to admit she's right.

02:06.598 --> 02:08.092
It's completely impractical.

02:08.133 --> 02:09.933
You know, anyone pursuing
the arts needs to go in

02:09.966 --> 02:11.736
with their eyes wide open.
We're talking

02:11.769 --> 02:14.781
zero job security
and impossible odds. But...

02:14.814 --> 02:17.612
I've always believed that you
<i>have</i> to pursue what you love.

02:17.645 --> 02:18.781
And that's why
this week's assignment

02:18.814 --> 02:20.455
is about a goofy-looking
kid who struggled

02:20.488 --> 02:22.321
for years in the music business.

02:22.354 --> 02:24.120
Finally.
It's Marilyn Manson Week.

02:24.161 --> 02:25.128
Close.

02:25.161 --> 02:26.823
Billy Joel.

02:26.856 --> 02:28.960
- Who?
- Oh, just a musical genius

02:28.993 --> 02:31.365
who's sold over 150 million
records worldwide.

02:31.406 --> 02:32.775
WILL:
That's right.

02:32.808 --> 02:34.909
Billy had to fight every step
of the way in his career.

02:34.942 --> 02:36.509
He had countless failures
and disappointments:

02:36.542 --> 02:38.006
writing songs
that nobody wanted,

02:38.047 --> 02:40.420
playing piano in seedy bars
just to pay the rent,

02:40.453 --> 02:43.419
being told he'd never make it
because he didn't look "right."

02:43.452 --> 02:46.258
Translation: too Jewish.

02:46.290 --> 02:47.994
But he ignored
the haters and he kept

02:48.027 --> 02:50.164
pursuing his dream,
becoming the third

02:50.197 --> 02:52.634
best-selling solo artist
of all time.

02:52.675 --> 02:53.772
I mean, he is
a true inspiration

02:53.805 --> 02:55.610
to anyone pursuing
a career in the arts,

02:55.643 --> 02:57.042
like our very own.

02:57.075 --> 02:59.545
Mr. Blaine Anderson
and Mr. Sam Evans.

02:59.578 --> 03:00.978
(cheering and applause) That's right!
All right,

03:01.011 --> 03:02.613
as some of you may or may not
know, this week is my big.

03:02.654 --> 03:04.391
NYADA audition.
I know.

03:04.423 --> 03:05.958
It's terrifying.
So I'm leaving today

03:05.991 --> 03:08.020
to maybe get some last-minute
tips from Kurt and Rachel.

03:08.053 --> 03:09.755
And I'm going with him
because I have an interview

03:09.788 --> 03:12.289
with the theater department
at Hunter College.

03:12.322 --> 03:13.457
They saw and they loved

03:13.490 --> 03:15.332
my "Tornado of Talent"
impressions reel.

03:15.365 --> 03:17.599
And I'm up
for this awesome scholarship,

03:17.632 --> 03:20.136
the Channing Tatum
Former Male Stripper Grant.

03:20.169 --> 03:21.472
But we spoke to Mr. Shue

03:21.505 --> 03:23.609
and, because we have to miss
this week's lesson,

03:23.642 --> 03:25.682
he thought the least
we could do is maybe...

03:25.715 --> 03:29.552
Kick it off with our very own
take on a classic BJ.

03:29.593 --> 03:30.489
Billy... Billy Joel.

03:30.522 --> 03:31.826
Hit it.

What's going on?

05:43.855 --> 05:46.420
Hi! I can't believe you guys are here.
What? You guys are...

05:46.453 --> 05:48.291
Oh, my God. You guys are...
Oh, wow! Hi! Mwah.

05:48.324 --> 05:51.825
Oh, my God. You guys...
(school bell rings)

05:58.931 --> 06:00.234
Hey, Becky.

06:00.267 --> 06:02.338
Hi, hot stuff.
Want to suck face

06:02.370 --> 06:04.430
and look at my boobs?

06:04.471 --> 06:06.439
No. Um, can I ask you something?

06:06.472 --> 06:08.335
What do you plan on doing
after you graduate?

06:08.377 --> 06:09.840
Why? What are you gonna do?

06:09.873 --> 06:11.712
Film school. I'm going
to college in New York.

06:11.745 --> 06:13.578
Ew. Lame.

06:13.611 --> 06:16.388
College is for suckers.

06:16.421 --> 06:18.723
I know college might not be
for everybody, but...

06:18.756 --> 06:20.557
you know, Becky,
when I was looking at schools

06:20.587 --> 06:21.891
that were good for people
with disabilities,

06:21.924 --> 06:23.061
I learned that a lot of them

06:23.094 --> 06:24.861
have programs for
mentally handicapable students.

06:24.894 --> 06:27.197
And I'd be happy to help you
do some research.

06:27.230 --> 06:29.668
SUE:
Oh, that won't be necessary.

06:29.701 --> 06:32.066
Hey, Becky, will you excuse us

06:32.099 --> 06:34.234
for just a sec?
Sure thing, Coach.

06:34.267 --> 06:36.905
(quietly):
What exactly are you doing?

06:36.938 --> 06:39.040
I-I just want to make sure
that Becky was aware

06:39.073 --> 06:40.302
of what all her options are.

06:40.335 --> 06:41.905
She could go to college
and get a job...

06:41.946 --> 06:43.916
Well, she has a job.
She's my Beckretary.

06:43.949 --> 06:45.654
And here
she will remain indefinitely

06:45.687 --> 06:47.517
in a safe and stable
environment,

06:47.550 --> 06:49.683
working alongside someone
who cares very deeply

06:49.716 --> 06:51.352
for her.
I was trying to help.

06:51.385 --> 06:53.753
Well, if you really want
to help, Muppet Stephen Hawking,

06:53.786 --> 06:55.587
you'll stop inserting yourself
into situations

06:55.589 --> 06:56.757
you know nothing about.

06:57.864 --> 06:59.863
(school bell rings)

07:02.532 --> 07:04.531
(sighs)

07:08.873 --> 07:10.114
I'm sorry.

07:10.147 --> 07:11.580
For breaking into my locker?

07:11.613 --> 07:13.715
For breaking your trust.
(groans)

07:13.748 --> 07:15.186
Marley, wait.

07:15.219 --> 07:16.952
Look,

07:16.985 --> 07:19.120
I screwed up.
I made a stupid mistake,

07:19.153 --> 07:20.623
and I want to make it up
to you.

07:20.656 --> 07:22.087
Please just let me say
I'm sorry.

07:22.120 --> 07:24.254
You shouldn't have to.
You are who you are,

07:24.287 --> 07:26.461
and I knew who you were
when I got into this.

07:26.494 --> 07:28.460
It was stupid of me
to try to change you.

07:28.493 --> 07:30.060
I did change.
I'm not that guy anymore.

07:30.093 --> 07:31.060
You are.

07:31.093 --> 07:32.332
You'll always be that guy.

07:40.100 --> 07:42.737
Can I get you guys a refill?
Why are you still working?

07:42.770 --> 07:44.402
Aren't you rehearsing,
like, 24/7?

07:44.443 --> 07:46.443
Fanny Brice was a working girl.
My director and I think

07:46.476 --> 07:48.443
it's really important
to keep the character

07:48.476 --> 07:51.253
as alive and authentic
as possible.

07:51.286 --> 07:54.222
So, did you boys like those
historical sites I recommended?

07:54.255 --> 07:55.558
Um, we checked out
that deconstructed bathhouse

07:55.591 --> 07:56.759
on St. Mark's

07:56.796 --> 07:58.127
where Tennessee Williams
got in that fistfight

07:58.160 --> 07:59.294
- with Tallulah Bankhead.
- Oh, yeah.

07:59.327 --> 08:00.390
- That was awesome.
- Cool.

08:00.423 --> 08:02.724
Uh, but it was mostly
campus visits.

08:02.757 --> 08:04.491
Um, NYU, Columbia...

08:04.532 --> 08:05.699
Why? You're going to NYADA.

08:05.732 --> 08:07.196
I-I need safety schools, Kurt.

08:07.229 --> 08:08.869
I haven't gotten in yet.
But you will

08:08.902 --> 08:10.334
as soon as you audition.

08:10.367 --> 08:11.734
The way I've talked you up
to Carmen Tibideaux,

08:11.775 --> 08:12.741
she's gonna offer you

08:12.774 --> 08:14.507
a spot on the spot.

08:14.540 --> 08:16.305
Which reminds me,

08:16.338 --> 08:17.610
are you up
for a little trial run?

08:17.643 --> 08:18.939
I don't want to send you
into the lions' den

08:18.980 --> 08:20.349
under-rehearsed. Come on.

08:20.383 --> 08:22.614
Yes. Yes.

08:22.647 --> 08:24.118
Come on. Don't worry.

08:24.151 --> 08:25.581
The piano awaits.

08:25.621 --> 08:27.747
Uh, hello, everyone.

08:27.788 --> 08:29.355
Welcome to the Spotlight Diner

08:29.388 --> 08:32.861
and to a very special
performance.

08:32.894 --> 08:34.659
Seriously? You all need
to be stopped.

14:14.100 --> 14:17.239
Yeah, I kind of had an, um...
a breakthrough a few months ago,

14:17.272 --> 14:21.513
'cause I'm-I'm not, like, a...
a good student, but I realize

14:21.546 --> 14:23.812
that what I'm really good at
is impressions,

14:23.852 --> 14:25.886
so, I started
to do this impression

14:25.919 --> 14:30.495
of a good high school student,
and it... it's kind of working.

14:30.528 --> 14:32.594
Okay.

14:32.627 --> 14:35.165
Tell me why
you want to go to Hunter.

Um, I-I don't know
that much about it,

14:37.177 --> 14:39.110
except that there... well,
there's more women than guys,

14:39.143 --> 14:40.706
and that's...
that's great for me,

14:40.739 --> 14:42.736
because I'm totally
into feminist issues.

14:42.769 --> 14:44.705
Like, just because
women don't make

14:44.746 --> 14:47.211
as much as guys do
to do the same job,

14:47.244 --> 14:48.615
it's totally not cool

14:48.656 --> 14:50.720
that they aren't given
the same amount of respect.

14:50.753 --> 14:52.224
And, like, why can't...?

14:52.257 --> 14:55.023
Well, why can guys go shirtless
at the beach, but chicks can't?

14:55.056 --> 14:56.759

14:56.792 --> 14:59.464

19:42.382 --> 19:45.086
Am I right?
Do you want to go to college?

19:45.119 --> 19:48.251
What if I go, and
everybody makes fun of me again?

19:48.284 --> 19:50.983
What if everybody
calls me stupid

19:51.016 --> 19:52.455
like they always used to?

19:52.489 --> 19:53.729
They won't, because you'll have

19:53.755 --> 19:55.027
all these awesome professors

19:55.060 --> 19:57.462
and counselors and new friends
that'll have your back.

19:57.495 --> 19:58.862
And all your old friends will

19:58.903 --> 20:00.397
have your back, too.
Like me.

20:00.430 --> 20:03.163
Are you really my friend?

20:03.204 --> 20:04.972
Always.

20:05.005 --> 20:07.005
Come here.

20:09.878 --> 20:11.244
(sighs)

20:15.076 --> 20:17.347
At first, I was
just hurt and angry

20:17.380 --> 20:21.514
and embarrassed, because
he turned out to be exactly

20:21.547 --> 20:24.006
what everyone said he was.

20:24.033 --> 20:26.730
And then, I was, like,
"Okay, fine, it's over."

20:26.771 --> 20:29.540
But then, he's putting
flowers in my locker,

20:29.573 --> 20:31.340
and then, he's
singing "My Life"

20:31.373 --> 20:33.244
in Glee Club, like
he's the victim.

20:33.277 --> 20:35.613
Mm. It's just all so schizo.

20:35.646 --> 20:37.878
And the worst part is,
I still miss him.

20:37.919 --> 20:39.454
Oh, of course you do.

20:39.487 --> 20:41.486
And I hate it so much!

20:41.519 --> 20:43.885
Yeah.
(sighs)

20:43.918 --> 20:45.895
Oh.

20:45.928 --> 20:47.560
I'm just glad we
didn't end up...

20:47.593 --> 20:49.866
Doin' the humpty-hump?

20:49.899 --> 20:51.667
- Ooh.
- Mom.

20:51.700 --> 20:53.336
(laughs) Mom!

20:53.369 --> 20:56.233
(laughing): Oh, my God,
I'm scarred for life.

20:56.274 --> 20:57.441
Oh, Marley.

20:57.474 --> 20:59.274
(laughing)

20:59.307 --> 21:00.907
You know, when I was your age,

21:00.948 --> 21:02.646
I was... I was like
a bad-boy magnet.

21:02.679 --> 21:04.519
Ooh! How do you think
I met your dad?

21:04.552 --> 21:05.686
Mm.

21:05.719 --> 21:08.758
So, I know why you loved Jake.

21:08.791 --> 21:10.925
You know, but I am glad
that you waited

21:10.957 --> 21:13.122
and dodged that bullet.

21:15.227 --> 21:17.626
You know, your first time
is something

21:17.659 --> 21:19.396
that you can never
get back, honey.

21:22.300 --> 21:25.172
You need to hold out
for a good guy this time.

21:25.205 --> 21:27.838
You know, not just one
you have feelings for, but

21:27.878 --> 21:29.743
someone you can trust.

21:29.776 --> 21:32.016
You know?

21:32.049 --> 21:33.648
Mmm.

21:33.681 --> 21:36.154
Okay, Sam Evans,
this is Barbara Brownfield.

21:36.187 --> 21:38.187
She's our amazing photographer
at <i>Funny Girl.</i>

21:38.221 --> 21:39.628
This is Sam Evans,

21:39.661 --> 21:42.320
my insanely handsome
soon-to-be-supermodel friend.

21:42.360 --> 21:45.189
I'm not gonna lie. I'm really,
really, really nervous. Uh,

21:45.222 --> 21:47.725
I've been pitting out all
my T-shirts. Um, it's just like

21:47.758 --> 21:49.431
my entire future is
in your hands.

21:49.464 --> 21:52.032
You know, just try to hide
all my bad angles.

21:52.065 --> 21:53.302
What bad angles?

21:53.335 --> 21:55.037
(laughs)

21:55.071 --> 21:56.005
Excellent.

21:56.038 --> 21:57.470
I love what you're doing. Yep.

21:57.503 --> 21:58.838
(quietly):
I'm feeling it.

21:58.871 --> 22:00.805
(shutter clicking) We got it.

22:00.838 --> 22:02.045
Great.

22:02.078 --> 22:03.340
You're waiting for the bus.

22:03.373 --> 22:05.338
Look for the bus.
Oh, I love that.

22:05.379 --> 22:07.808
Hey, want a piece of this?
Come on. How about

22:07.841 --> 22:10.373
you're so hot that you had
to take some clothes off?

22:10.407 --> 22:11.844
Okay, strip it off.

22:11.877 --> 22:12.843
Come on, Sam.

22:12.876 --> 22:14.348
Yes!

22:14.381 --> 22:16.247
Okay, let me just put

22:16.280 --> 22:18.056
a little bit of
this oil on you.

22:18.089 --> 22:19.520
Looking great.

22:20.521 --> 22:22.393
Okay.

22:22.426 --> 22:24.329
BARBARA:
Flex, like... (grunts)

22:24.362 --> 22:25.561
Excellent.

22:25.594 --> 22:27.032
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

22:27.065 --> 22:28.528
BARBARA:
There you go.

22:28.561 --> 22:30.568
Super. Thank you.

22:30.601 --> 22:31.936
<i>We got it.</i>

22:32.969 --> 22:35.439
Artie Abrams...

22:35.472 --> 22:37.574
(over speaker):
wheel your butt

22:37.607 --> 22:40.145
into my office, now.

22:40.178 --> 22:42.442
♪

22:56.464 --> 22:59.433
I went to my pharmacy
and took the liberty

22:59.474 --> 23:02.445
of purchasing you a good
old-fashioned ear douche,

23:02.478 --> 23:05.045
because you obviously
didn't hear me

23:05.078 --> 23:07.211
when I distinctly told you,

23:07.244 --> 23:10.516
with perfect diction
and great clarity,

23:10.549 --> 23:12.854
to stop meddling in the affairs

23:12.887 --> 23:15.898
of one Becky Jackson.

23:16.996 --> 23:18.636
(pants)

23:18.669 --> 23:20.437
Principal Sylvester,
Becky told me herself

23:20.470 --> 23:22.006
she wants to go to college,

23:22.039 --> 23:23.942
and there's no reason
why she can't.

23:23.976 --> 23:25.511
How dare you lecture me.

23:25.544 --> 23:26.975
You don't think I know that?

23:27.016 --> 23:29.648
You don't think I've contacted
each and every school

23:29.681 --> 23:32.252
and quizzed them endlessly
about their programs?

23:32.293 --> 23:34.095
Then why aren't you helping her?

23:34.128 --> 23:36.560
Because she's not ready.
Or maybe you're not ready.

23:36.601 --> 23:39.462
I know you love Becky like a daughter,
and you want to protect her,

23:39.503 --> 23:41.566
and I get it, because of
everything you've been through.

23:41.599 --> 23:43.303
But you have to let her go.

23:43.336 --> 23:45.871
There's a really good program
for students with Down syndrome

23:45.904 --> 23:48.442
at the University of Cincinnati,
and I'm gonna take her there

23:48.483 --> 23:51.050
for a tour. Her parents
already gave me permission.

23:51.083 --> 23:53.714
It's only two hours from here, and
it'd be really easy to visit.

23:54.755 --> 23:56.618
Mr. Abrams.

23:58.220 --> 24:00.324
Ask tough questions.

24:00.357 --> 24:02.662
Is there Wi-Fi
on campus?

24:02.695 --> 24:05.670
Do all freshman gain 20 pounds
from cafeteria food?

24:05.703 --> 24:08.040
I want a full report
when you come back.

24:08.073 --> 24:09.937
(school bell ringing)

24:10.979 --> 24:12.980
Go out with me.

24:13.014 --> 24:14.814
Ryder... no.

24:14.854 --> 24:17.085
Look, I'm single, you're
newly single... why not?

24:17.118 --> 24:19.317
I have good family values.
I-I-I go to church.

24:19.358 --> 24:21.189
I've never been arrested.
I'm not ugly.

24:21.222 --> 24:23.693
Now that I can read,
I get good grades, and...

24:23.726 --> 24:25.957
I've always thought you
were the most amazing girl

24:25.998 --> 24:27.597
in the history of the world.

24:27.630 --> 24:29.429
That's...

24:29.462 --> 24:31.429
really sweet.

24:31.470 --> 24:34.405
I just don't think
I want to date anyone right now.

24:34.438 --> 24:36.302
What happened with Jake
was really painful,

24:36.343 --> 24:39.172
and I need
a little break from men.

24:39.205 --> 24:42.244
(sighs) Look, I'm a really,
really good guy, Marley.

24:42.277 --> 24:43.675
I would never hurt you.

24:43.708 --> 24:46.413
All I need is a chance,
and I swear I would

24:46.446 --> 24:49.549
never, ever do to
you what he did.

24:49.582 --> 24:51.757

(sighs)

27:02.126 --> 27:03.557
Yes.

27:13.694 --> 27:16.262
Carmen Tibideaux is a classicist,
so for your audition,

27:16.295 --> 27:18.263
let's try to avoid
shocking patterns,

27:18.296 --> 27:19.936
and anything that says,
"Look at me,

27:19.969 --> 27:22.643
I'm the center of attention, and
this primary color proves it."

27:22.676 --> 27:24.538
Uh, Kurt... wait.

27:24.578 --> 27:25.576
Just stop.

27:25.609 --> 27:27.377
I have to tell you something.

27:27.410 --> 27:29.975
Oh, no.
You've got that look.

27:30.008 --> 27:32.246
That look I saw
the night after callbacks.

27:32.279 --> 27:33.510
If you cheated on me again,

27:33.551 --> 27:35.478
I will not accept
sex addiction as an excuse.

27:35.519 --> 27:39.255
I... don't want to
audition for NYADA.

27:39.288 --> 27:42.255
- Well, you can't get in on reputation alone.
- No, NYADA is

27:42.288 --> 27:44.768
just a performing arts school...
that's all you can study there.

27:44.792 --> 27:46.628
I have other passions,
other... interests

27:46.661 --> 27:48.492
I might want to
explore in college.

27:48.525 --> 27:50.661
- For instance? - I don't know.
You know how much

27:50.694 --> 27:53.429
I love kids, and I'd love to be
a teacher like Mr. Shue, or...

27:53.470 --> 27:54.733
or premed or something.

27:54.766 --> 27:57.069
Of course. How could I forget
the numerous conversations

27:57.102 --> 27:59.942
- we've had about you wanting
to be a doctor. - My passion

27:59.975 --> 28:01.975
for medicine has always
been my secret shame.

28:02.008 --> 28:04.513
My first guy crush
was... George Clooney,

28:04.548 --> 28:06.756
aka Dr. Ross, on <i>ER.</i>

28:06.789 --> 28:09.450
And it's no secret what my
favorite Milton Bradley game is.

28:09.491 --> 28:11.922
Here goes his funny bone.

28:11.955 --> 28:14.090
(buzz) (quietly): Dang.

28:14.123 --> 28:17.329
It's a great relief to be
able to tell you this now.

28:17.362 --> 28:19.996
I'm just glad I did it
before my audition.

28:20.037 --> 28:21.237
What?

28:22.374 --> 28:24.404
We're getting married.

28:24.437 --> 28:25.404
I know you,

28:25.437 --> 28:26.837
and I get it, and this is

28:26.877 --> 28:30.475
a sweet side of you that
I don't get to see very often.

28:30.508 --> 28:32.544
You're scared.

28:32.577 --> 28:34.943
Of what? Look, when
I first moved here,

28:34.977 --> 28:37.312
I-I honestly felt like
I was Crocodile Dundee.

28:37.345 --> 28:39.816
Right, the city's huge,
the buildings are huge.

28:39.849 --> 28:42.050
And everywhere you look, it's, like,
there's all these beautiful people

28:42.091 --> 28:44.051
who seem to have just come
from some secret meeting

28:44.061 --> 28:46.325
where they teach you how
to make it in the big city.

28:46.358 --> 28:49.027
What if I don't get in?
<i>You</i> didn't.

28:49.060 --> 28:51.830
You will. And if you
don't, it won't matter.

28:51.871 --> 28:54.706
You're a performer; you're
gonna find the spotlight.

28:54.739 --> 28:56.677
And you can't shy away
from your greatness

28:56.710 --> 28:58.581
just because you're afraid
you're not great enough.

28:58.614 --> 29:00.887
You have a gift,
and it wouldn't be right

29:00.920 --> 29:02.825
to let you hide that away.

29:02.858 --> 29:05.196
Thanks for knowing me.

29:05.229 --> 29:06.935
I love you.

29:06.968 --> 29:09.272
I love you, too.

29:10.737 --> 29:13.345
And we're in this together.

29:13.378 --> 29:15.612
I can't stop you
from failing, but...

29:15.645 --> 29:19.055
I can promise to make it
safe if you do.

29:19.088 --> 29:21.024
And I think Santana
should do your makeup.

29:27.034 --> 29:28.402
WOMAN:
Becky, our goal here

29:28.435 --> 29:29.802
at the University of Cincinnati

29:29.835 --> 29:31.202
is to make college life

29:31.235 --> 29:33.735
as inclusive as possible.

29:35.105 --> 29:37.608
This is one of our
independent living classes.

29:37.641 --> 29:39.943
Students are working
on bill paying

29:39.976 --> 29:42.573
and budgeting their money.

29:42.606 --> 29:44.709
Everybody, this
is Becky Jackson.

29:44.742 --> 29:46.107
She's thinking of coming here.

29:46.148 --> 29:48.745
BOY:
Don't. This place sucks.

29:48.778 --> 29:51.482
Just kidding.
I love it here.

29:51.515 --> 29:53.685
(laughter) Whoo!

29:55.487 --> 29:56.826
Is that your boyfriend?

29:56.858 --> 29:59.930
Artie? Hell, no.
He's got herpes.

29:59.963 --> 30:00.802
Ew.

30:00.835 --> 30:02.067
Just for the record,

30:02.100 --> 30:03.902
I don't have herpes.

30:03.943 --> 30:05.745
Becky, I think

30:05.778 --> 30:07.849
you're very funny,
and very pretty.

30:07.882 --> 30:10.016
Tell me something I <i>don't</i> know.

30:10.049 --> 30:11.310
Oh, snap.

30:11.351 --> 30:12.445
(laughter)

30:12.478 --> 30:14.146
TEACHER:
Becky, would you like

30:14.179 --> 30:16.980
to stay and watch the class for a while?
BOY: Yeah.

30:17.021 --> 30:20.418
You can sit next to me.

30:22.019 --> 30:23.091
Okay.

30:23.124 --> 30:24.956
Whatever.

30:39.180 --> 30:40.683
So, how is your name
pronounced again?

30:40.716 --> 30:41.979
Because I heard
it was "Bee-shay,"

30:42.020 --> 30:43.755
but now that
I see it spelled out,

30:43.788 --> 30:45.355
it looks like it should be
"Bitch-ette."

30:45.388 --> 30:46.754
Like a little mini bitch.

30:46.787 --> 30:48.690
Is that what your name
means in French,

30:48.723 --> 30:49.891
or Italian,

30:49.924 --> 30:51.124
whatever it is?

30:51.157 --> 30:52.893
I'm... I tend to talk too much.

30:52.934 --> 30:55.100
I'm used to dealing with boys
far prettier

30:55.133 --> 30:56.963
and considerably stupider
than you.

30:56.996 --> 30:58.803
Oh, cool. Look, I
agreed to meet with you

30:58.836 --> 31:00.235
because I trust Barb
Brownfield's eye.

31:00.268 --> 31:03.911
And I must admit,
I do respond to your look.

31:03.944 --> 31:07.680
Your Midwestern eyes
have the vacant stare

31:07.713 --> 31:08.953
of a cow's.

31:08.986 --> 31:11.128
I don't have any of those
on my roster.

31:11.156 --> 31:12.821
And you have a unique mouth.

31:12.861 --> 31:14.156
It's, like, your lips,

31:14.189 --> 31:17.088
they're kind of like...

31:17.121 --> 31:18.159
Trouty.

31:18.192 --> 31:19.526
Yes! That's it.

31:19.559 --> 31:20.861
Trouty mouth.

31:20.894 --> 31:22.664
Can I have, uh, one of these...

31:22.697 --> 31:23.832
No.

31:23.865 --> 31:25.464
So, this is how this works.

31:25.497 --> 31:26.697
These pictures...

31:26.738 --> 31:28.370
- Mm-hmm.
- They're nice.

31:28.403 --> 31:29.772
But you need better.

31:29.805 --> 31:31.844
And you are gonna pay
for those yourself.

31:31.877 --> 31:33.507
Wait, so are you saying
you're gonna

31:33.548 --> 31:35.274
sign me? Because
if you do, I swear,

31:35.315 --> 31:36.944
I won't let you down.
I have been working, like,

31:36.977 --> 31:40.248
- my entire life on different poses...
- Oh, slow down, Midnight Cowboy.

31:40.281 --> 31:42.553
Look, this is how
male modeling works.

31:42.586 --> 31:44.154
Most of what you'll get
will be runway,

31:44.187 --> 31:45.707
and you're not
gonna get paid for that,

31:45.725 --> 31:47.628
but hopefully, they'll let you
keep some of the clothes.

31:47.662 --> 31:50.693
Now, <i>if</i> you book
print work, chances are

31:50.734 --> 31:52.765
you'll be a shirtless pawn,
there to enhance

31:52.799 --> 31:55.468
the <i>real</i> gem of the shoot...
the girl.

31:55.501 --> 31:57.207
You'll be paid enough
to live in the city,

31:57.240 --> 31:58.472
with roommates.

31:58.505 --> 31:59.639
This is not glamorous.

31:59.672 --> 32:01.574
This is not
what you think it is.

32:01.607 --> 32:03.078
You are one of

32:03.111 --> 32:05.310
10,000 beautiful boys
here in New York City,

32:05.343 --> 32:07.214
and the word that you will hear

32:07.247 --> 32:09.551
more than any other
during your brief

32:09.584 --> 32:10.921
career...

32:10.954 --> 32:13.628
will be... "no."

32:13.662 --> 32:15.325
Well, you know, like,
dreams aren't easy,

32:15.366 --> 32:18.228
and, I mean, I come from a place
where even the idea of sitting

32:18.269 --> 32:20.930
in this room with you
would seem impossible.

32:20.963 --> 32:22.836
I mean, I know who I am, and...

32:22.869 --> 32:24.710
I know where I'm
headed in life.

32:24.743 --> 32:26.974
I can take a few no's
along the way.

32:27.007 --> 32:28.907
I do like you, Trouty Mouth.

32:28.940 --> 32:30.180
(giggles)
Well, this is awesome.

32:30.211 --> 32:31.812
Okay, this is so awesome.
I'll get those,

32:31.842 --> 32:34.681
- uh, pictures taken right away.
- Uh, no, no, no, you won't.

32:34.714 --> 32:36.482
You're gonna have to
wait at least a week.

32:36.515 --> 32:38.749
- You got to lose ten pounds.
- Well, ten pounds doesn't really

32:38.790 --> 32:40.990
seem healthy to me...
you think I'm... fat?

32:41.023 --> 32:42.021
Not for Kansas.

32:42.055 --> 32:43.859
- Ohio.
- Look, you are

32:43.892 --> 32:45.825
in the big time now, cowboy.

32:45.858 --> 32:49.027
The camera likes... starvation.

32:52.667 --> 32:54.266
We don't have room for this.

32:54.307 --> 32:55.874
Uh, yes, we do. Right there.

32:55.907 --> 32:58.074
Okay, seriously,
I'm not gonna be able to survive

32:58.107 --> 32:59.808
if you and your Hag
Berry are gonna be

32:59.841 --> 33:02.272
tickling those ivories,
belting out gay hits

33:02.313 --> 33:03.441
from <i>Rent</i> and <i>Showboat</i> all day.

33:03.482 --> 33:05.114
It's a thank you

33:05.147 --> 33:07.715
for allowing me and Sam
to stay here.

33:07.748 --> 33:10.321
- Hey, you guys, I have some bread
here if you want. - No can do.

33:10.354 --> 33:14.258
No, right now I'm just on this
Mentos and flavored air diet.

33:14.291 --> 33:17.095
Sam, that's ridiculous. You
don't need to lose ten pounds.

33:17.128 --> 33:18.399
Yeah, Sam, we all agree.

33:18.432 --> 33:20.270
You don't need to be prison-camp
skinny to be a model.

33:20.303 --> 33:22.733
- I think you should find
another agency. - No,

33:22.766 --> 33:24.867
House of Bichette is, like,
the best agency in town.

33:24.900 --> 33:27.202
You know what I think?
I think that this argument

33:27.235 --> 33:29.445
would be best made in a song.

33:29.478 --> 33:31.014
Yes. SANTANA: Oh, no.

33:31.047 --> 33:32.614
No, no, no, no, no.

33:32.647 --> 33:34.413
Do you see this?
This is what's going

33:34.446 --> 33:36.443
to happen from every argument

33:36.484 --> 33:38.114
or discussion or meal
from now on.

33:38.147 --> 33:40.147
It's gonna end
in a freaking sing-along.

33:40.188 --> 33:42.487
It's bad enough we need
to be singing waiters, okay?

33:42.528 --> 33:44.689
I can't have this in my home.
I need my peaceful place.

33:44.695 --> 33:46.659
You don't have to sing, Santana. (Billy
Joel's "Just the Way You Are" begins)

(school bell rings)
Good night, Coach.

36:34.705 --> 36:36.177
That's it?

36:36.210 --> 36:38.680
Don't let the bed bugs bite?

36:38.713 --> 36:41.280
You've been sitting out there
all day long

36:41.313 --> 36:42.745
with little dream bubbles

36:42.786 --> 36:44.652
floating over your head

36:44.685 --> 36:45.925
and not once
have you come in here

36:45.959 --> 36:48.423
to tell me how your trip
to college went.

36:48.463 --> 36:51.358
I don't want to hurt
your feelings, Coach.

36:51.399 --> 36:52.526
I don't have

36:52.567 --> 36:54.029
any feelings, Becky.

36:54.062 --> 36:55.533
It was okay, I guess.

36:55.566 --> 36:57.531
I don't have to take math.

36:57.564 --> 36:59.699
Someone takes notes for me.

36:59.732 --> 37:01.937
I can learn photography.

37:01.970 --> 37:03.936
Well, that sounds better
than okay to me.

37:03.969 --> 37:05.472
To tell you the truth,

37:05.505 --> 37:07.411
it was awesome.

37:07.444 --> 37:10.782
(clicks tongue) Are you sure
you're ready for this, honey?

37:10.815 --> 37:12.980
I never thought to say this.

37:13.013 --> 37:17.249
I've outgrown
these... high school bitches.

37:17.282 --> 37:19.052
Mmm.

37:19.085 --> 37:21.727
You're not sad, are you, Coach?

37:21.760 --> 37:24.728
I'm sad to be losing
the best damn secretary

37:24.769 --> 37:26.797
since the pre-collagen injected
Melanie Griffith

37:26.830 --> 37:28.627
in <i>Working Girl.</i>

37:28.660 --> 37:30.035
(sighs)

37:30.068 --> 37:32.269
But I'm more proud
than I am sad.

37:32.302 --> 37:34.239
Think I can help you

37:34.272 --> 37:36.072
write your application essay?

37:36.113 --> 37:37.776
Sure, Coach.

37:37.809 --> 37:39.941
Let's see what you got there.

37:39.975 --> 37:42.614
(sighs)

37:42.647 --> 37:45.119
Okay, well, you can't say that.

37:45.152 --> 37:46.456
And you can't say that.

37:46.489 --> 37:48.457
I can't say "crap" or "douche"?

37:48.490 --> 37:50.486
Even if you're talking
about Graydon Carter.

37:54.363 --> 37:56.626
(school bell rings)
(clears throat)

37:56.667 --> 37:58.232
Check your Instagram.

37:58.265 --> 38:00.262
O... kay.

38:05.875 --> 38:08.307
(chuckles)

38:08.340 --> 38:09.840
When did you do all that?

38:09.873 --> 38:11.777
Uh, last night.
After I dropped you off.

38:11.810 --> 38:13.513
I kind of couldn't stop
thinking about you.

38:13.546 --> 38:14.977
Oh...

38:15.018 --> 38:16.849
Look, I don't want to freak
you out and move too fast

38:16.882 --> 38:18.783
or anything, but I'd
love to do it again.

38:18.816 --> 38:20.046
Like, maybe tonight?

38:20.087 --> 38:24.052
So, you guys are, like,
really a thing now?

38:24.085 --> 38:25.253
Yeah?

38:25.285 --> 38:27.691
It's, uh, none
of your business anymore.

38:31.423 --> 38:32.287
Cool.

38:32.320 --> 38:33.856
Well,

38:33.889 --> 38:35.625
congratulations.

38:35.658 --> 38:36.866
Duty calls.

38:38.500 --> 38:40.802
Okay, if I'm going
to be honest here,

38:40.835 --> 38:43.305
just because we go out once
doesn't mean that we're...

38:43.339 --> 38:44.907
going out.

38:44.940 --> 38:46.372
Oh.

38:46.405 --> 38:48.076
I still just need time for me.

38:48.109 --> 38:49.446
Sure.

38:52.914 --> 38:54.208
Are we done, Coach?

38:54.249 --> 38:55.848
Oh, not quite yet, Becky.

38:55.881 --> 38:57.785
We're gonna drench this
whole thing in glitter and hoist

38:57.818 --> 38:59.354
three dozen rainbow flags.

38:59.387 --> 39:01.290
Got it, Coach. Go Bearcats!

39:01.323 --> 39:02.687
Go Bearcats.

39:02.720 --> 39:04.422
So you finally came around.

39:04.455 --> 39:05.916
What made you see the light?

39:05.957 --> 39:08.086
Well, Butt Chin, in the words
of Civil Rights leader.

39:08.126 --> 39:10.560
Genghis Khan,
everyone deserves a shot

39:10.593 --> 39:13.159
at their dreams, and
I suppose that includes

39:13.200 --> 39:16.333
your hopelessly
misguided teen hobgoblins.

39:16.366 --> 39:19.034
Now, don't forget to remind them
about the myriad

39:19.067 --> 39:22.373
of show business legends born
and bred right here in Lima.

39:22.406 --> 39:24.110
And that would be
a total of one,

39:24.143 --> 39:26.037
Ms. Phyllis Diller.

39:26.078 --> 39:29.075
You know, in a few decades,
when the New Directions are all

39:29.108 --> 39:31.275
on unemployment
and sexually pleasing

39:31.308 --> 39:34.014
some horny old casting assistant
just so they can be extras

39:34.047 --> 39:36.150
on season 33
of <i>The Bachelorette,</i>

39:36.183 --> 39:39.484
they'll look back on this
time and remember you fondly.

39:39.517 --> 39:40.853
TINA: That's not
true, Sue Sylvester!

39:40.886 --> 39:42.357
One day, we're gonna be
big, big stars.

39:42.390 --> 39:45.029
SUE: Well, of course
you are, my dear.

39:45.062 --> 39:46.029
Isn't that right, William?

39:46.062 --> 39:46.997
Blam!

39:47.030 --> 39:48.534
They're back! ARTIE: Yo, dawgs,

39:48.567 --> 39:50.030
tell us everything. SAM: Fact:

39:50.063 --> 39:51.535
Blaine thought he wanted
to be a doctor for a minute

39:51.568 --> 39:53.010
and then Kurt talked him
out of it

39:53.043 --> 39:54.844
and then he went to NYADA and
he crushed his NYADA audition.

39:54.877 --> 39:56.012
Sam, that was my news.

39:56.045 --> 39:57.412
Oh, and, uh, Mr. Shue,
did you know

39:57.445 --> 39:59.148
that Billy Joel never went
to college?

39:59.181 --> 40:01.250
Fact: he didn't, and I
think you forgot to tell us

40:01.283 --> 40:03.419
about that. So I'm gonna
skip college, too,

40:03.452 --> 40:05.958
- and become a male model.
- Impossible. You're too fat.

40:05.991 --> 40:08.023
No, I'm not. And I don't care
what you or Ms. Bichette

40:08.063 --> 40:09.263
or anyone says.

40:09.296 --> 40:11.296
I like me just the way I am,
and I'm not gonna

40:11.329 --> 40:12.867
- change for anyone.
- Well, that is

40:12.900 --> 40:15.804
just the screw-you spirit
employers love.

40:15.837 --> 40:18.972
Honest to God,
I cannot imagine what goes on

40:19.013 --> 40:21.983
in your lumpish,
sexually ambiguous heads.

40:22.016 --> 40:23.384
'Cause they're nuts.

40:23.417 --> 40:24.522
Every one of them

40:24.555 --> 40:25.692
is crazy!

40:25.727 --> 40:26.687
Becky, you may be right.

40:27.399 --> 40:29.326
- We may be crazy.
- Oh, no,

40:29.367 --> 40:30.462
no, no, no. Don't you dare.

40:30.495 --> 40:32.231
Over my dead body
will you inexplicably

40:32.264 --> 40:34.001
shoehorn in another
Billy Joel song

40:34.042 --> 40:35.970
just to punctuate one
of your weekly lessons

40:36.011 --> 40:39.042
that inevitably veers off into
a saccharine barrage of angst

40:39.075 --> 40:41.681
and affirmation. (Billy Joel's
"You May Be Right" begins)
