THE NINJA KNIFE WASN'T IN
MORE THAN AN INCH,

03:22.463 --> 03:24.900
NOT DEEP ENOUGH TO KILL HIM,
SO, UH, HE WAS DROWNED.

03:24.900 --> 03:27.685
IN A KIDDIE POOL?WELL, IF SOMEONE WAS
HELPING HIM ALONG.

03:27.685 --> 03:29.557
I MEAN, A BIG,
ATHLETIC GUY LIKE TYLER,

A JOB FOR TWO PEOPLE.

03:31.428 --> 03:33.038
YEAH, BUT WHY DROWN HIM?

03:33.038 --> 03:34.649
WELL, PROBABLY SOMETHING TO DO
WITH THE DRUNKEN CARD GAME

03:34.649 --> 03:36.128

03:43.005 --> 03:45.268
I BET HE KNEW
HOW TO PLAY CARDS.

03:45.268 --> 03:47.792
I BET HE WON
A LOT OF MONEY.

03:47.792 --> 03:49.751
MONEY THAT NONE OF YOU
COULD SPARE.

03:51.405 --> 03:53.363
THEN SOMEONE ACCUSED HIM
OF CHEATING.

03:53.363 --> 03:56.018
THAT WOULD BE YOU
WITH THE RED EYES

03:56.018 --> 03:57.715

HE SMASHED A CHAIR
AND STARTED THROTTLING YOU

04:06.420 --> 04:10.772
UNTIL, UH, THIS BRAVE MAN
STEPPED IN TO HELP YOU

04:10.772 --> 04:13.731
AND RECEIVED A PUNCH
IN THE FACE FOR HIS TROUBLE.

04:13.731 --> 04:17.082
HENCE THE, UH, BADLY APPLIED

04:17.082 --> 04:19.389

04:21.696 --> 04:23.567
YOU WEAR YOUR WATCH
ON YOUR RIGHT HAND --

04:23.567 --> 04:25.265
PROBABLY LEFT-HANDED.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.267
SO JUDGING BY THE ANGLE
AND THE DEPTH OF THE WOUND,

04:27.267 --> 04:29.791
I WOULD GUESS THAT IT WAS YOU
THAT STABBED TYLER IN THE BACK

04:29.791 --> 04:31.619
TO STOP HIM FROM THROTTLING
BARRY HERE.

04:31.619 --> 04:34.230
NOW, STABBING TYLER IN THE BACK
DIDN'T HELP MUCH.

04:34.230 --> 04:35.710
IT MADE HIM MADDER.

04:35.710 --> 04:37.538
HE CHASED YOU OUTSIDE.
HE FELL IN THE POOL.

04:37.538 --> 04:40.454
THAT'S WHEN YOU TWO
WITH THE STILL-DAMP SNEAKERS

04:40.454 --> 04:43.413
GOT ON TOP OF HIM AND HELD HIM
DOWN UNTIL HE DROWNED.

04:43.413 --> 04:46.895
THEN YOU ALL CAME INSIDE
AND CLEANED THE ROOM.
