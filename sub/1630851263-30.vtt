00:31.248 --> 00:33.729
Thank you
for the gumdrop, Sparkleface.

00:55.707 --> 00:56.839
What up, yo?

00:56.882 --> 00:59.189
Gah! H-How did you know
I was down here?

00:59.233 --> 01:01.322
You are not
as stealthy as you think.

01:01.365 --> 01:02.714
So, what're you
doing down here?

01:02.758 --> 01:04.542
I'm going to organize
the evidence room.

01:04.586 --> 01:06.718
Ooh, we've never
been in there before.

01:06.762 --> 01:08.416
And I intend
to keep it that way.

01:08.459 --> 01:10.983
You're way too out of control
to be around such

01:11.027 --> 01:12.159
sensitive material.

01:12.202 --> 01:14.074
We most certainly are the not.

01:14.117 --> 01:16.685
If anything, you's trying
to control us too much.

01:16.728 --> 01:18.556
You're a total control freak.

01:18.600 --> 01:21.081
I'm not a control freak.
I'm your cool leader.

01:21.124 --> 01:23.909
Speaking of cool leaders,
what's Batman doing here?

01:23.953 --> 01:25.041
Batman!

01:25.085 --> 01:26.869
Hey! Get out of there!

01:26.912 --> 01:28.697
Ooh!

01:28.740 --> 01:31.091
Wow.

01:31.134 --> 01:35.138
Ugh! Okay, fine, you can stay
but this room is filled with

01:35.182 --> 01:37.140
all kinds of dangerous gadgets.

01:37.184 --> 01:38.402
So, you need to be careful.

01:38.446 --> 01:40.752
Relax, dude.
We will be careful.

01:42.450 --> 01:45.409
Yo, guys,
check out Dr. Light's laser.

01:45.453 --> 01:47.237
- Put that back!
Check it out, y'all.

01:47.281 --> 01:49.587
- I'm the Brain.

01:49.631 --> 01:52.634
Welcome to your doom, Titans.

01:56.942 --> 01:57.813
Get out of there, Cyborg!

01:57.856 --> 01:59.467
Ooh, I remember this.

01:59.510 --> 02:01.425
It's Brother Blood's
hypnosis helmet.

02:01.469 --> 02:03.471
Whoa! Take that off, Raven.

02:03.514 --> 02:05.299
Not until
you cluck like a chicken.

02:08.302 --> 02:09.346
Now, that's enough.

02:09.390 --> 02:11.174
Ooh, look friends.

02:11.218 --> 02:14.134
I have found
the remote that belongs
to the Control Freak.

02:14.177 --> 02:15.613
Whoa, give me that, Star.

02:15.657 --> 02:17.398
There's no telling
what that thing can do.

02:17.441 --> 02:19.139
Oh, very well.

02:19.182 --> 02:23.012
I shall enjoy using
the rocket launcher
instead. Whoo!

02:24.056 --> 02:26.276
- Whoa!

02:26.320 --> 02:28.583
Stop! You guys
are out of control!

02:28.626 --> 02:30.193
- No, we're not.

02:30.237 --> 02:31.977
We are just having the fun.

02:34.763 --> 02:37.635
Well, your fun is destroying
valuable evidence.

02:37.679 --> 02:39.637
I wish I could put
you all on pause.

02:41.596 --> 02:43.598
I don't believe this.

02:43.641 --> 02:45.339
- It actually worked.

02:47.036 --> 02:48.385
This is amazing.

02:48.429 --> 02:51.301
What just happened?

02:51.345 --> 02:53.129
And why does
my face hurt?

02:53.173 --> 02:56.654
This remote has the ability
to control your movements.

02:56.698 --> 02:59.614
And if it can do that,
I wonder what else it can do.

02:59.657 --> 03:01.268
Try hitting the "Info" button.

03:01.311 --> 03:04.445
- You are Robin,
member of the Teen Titans.

03:04.488 --> 03:06.403
You enjoy investing
in rental properties.

03:06.447 --> 03:08.492
You desperately seek attention

03:08.536 --> 03:10.451
- and you train for hours--
- Gah! Too much info!
Too much info! La-la-la-la!

03:20.243 --> 03:21.766
What did you do to our heads?

03:21.810 --> 03:23.464
I just pressed
the "Swap" button.

03:23.507 --> 03:25.640
Well, swap 'em back, bro.

03:27.076 --> 03:28.556
That was not cool, Robin!

03:28.599 --> 03:30.906
Oh, "Brighten" up, Raven.

03:33.082 --> 03:34.649
You're right, Robin.

03:34.692 --> 03:37.869
I shouldn't be upset with that
adorable face of yours.

03:37.913 --> 03:41.133
Just look at those
cute little cheeks.

03:41.177 --> 03:42.396
I just wanna pinch 'em.

03:42.439 --> 03:44.615
- Yes, I do, Yes I do.

03:44.659 --> 03:46.008
Too bright! Too bright!

03:48.010 --> 03:49.664
I'm gonna eat your face!

03:49.707 --> 03:51.666
Too dark! Too dark!

03:51.709 --> 03:53.668
Let's just keep you
on "Default."

03:53.711 --> 03:55.713
What does
the "Sap" button do?

03:55.757 --> 03:58.455
I don't know, Star.
Let's find out.

04:02.503 --> 04:07.551
- Goal!

04:07.595 --> 04:09.423
Okay, Robin,
you've had your fun.

04:09.466 --> 04:11.163
Now, let us have the turn.

04:11.207 --> 04:15.211
Forget it. I finally have
the power to control you guys.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.691
I'm not giving that up.

04:16.734 --> 04:18.693
No, c'mon, man. You shouldn't
get to control us.

04:18.736 --> 04:20.390
Now, give us that remote, fool.

04:20.434 --> 04:21.739
- No!

04:21.783 --> 04:23.306
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:23.350 --> 04:25.090
That's mine.
Hands off!

04:25.134 --> 04:26.657
Gimme the remote.

04:35.013 --> 04:36.972
Nice going.

04:37.015 --> 04:38.930
You hit the "Parental Lock"
button and now we're locked
inside this room.

04:42.630 --> 04:44.284
Well, do you know the code?

04:44.327 --> 04:45.850
No, I don't know the code.

04:45.894 --> 04:47.287
Don't worry, y'all.

04:47.330 --> 04:48.592
I'll get that door open.

04:48.636 --> 04:50.551
Yes! Gabba goo!

04:50.594 --> 04:53.075
Wait!

04:57.645 --> 04:58.994
Oops, my bad.

04:59.037 --> 05:00.952
That door is made of
reflective steel.

05:00.996 --> 05:02.650
Lasers aren't gonna work on it.

05:02.693 --> 05:04.565
- So, what did you
expect us to do?

05:06.218 --> 05:10.353
I want you to sit in that
corner and promise me
you won't touch anything.

05:10.397 --> 05:13.617
You don't have to treat us
like a bunch of babies.

05:13.661 --> 05:17.404
No? That's exactly
what I should do.

05:20.581 --> 05:22.452
Mama!

05:22.496 --> 05:25.455
This way, Pain Bot can
keep an eye on you while
I find a way out of here.

05:25.499 --> 05:26.674
Pain.

05:27.588 --> 05:28.806
Now, let's see.

05:28.850 --> 05:30.765
This door has
a steel hammer lock.

05:30.808 --> 05:32.549
- There are no air vents.
Pain.

05:32.593 --> 05:33.985
Pain Bot, please, I'm thinking.

05:38.773 --> 05:41.950
Pain, pain,
pain, pain, pain...

05:41.993 --> 05:43.473
No, no, no. Put that down.

05:43.517 --> 05:44.648
You're gonna hurt yourself.

05:44.692 --> 05:46.520
No, it's mine.

05:51.002 --> 05:52.003
Ow!

05:56.399 --> 05:57.748
That's better.

06:00.011 --> 06:02.840
Yum-yum-yum-yum.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.845
- Gah! Eject!

06:13.590 --> 06:15.723
Whee!

06:16.811 --> 06:18.813
Phew! That was close.

06:24.035 --> 06:25.472
Robin.

06:26.690 --> 06:27.952
Look at the me!

06:27.996 --> 06:29.476
I've got you! I've got you!

06:39.616 --> 06:41.313
Ah, this isn't working.

06:41.357 --> 06:43.664
You're even more out of control
than you were as teenagers.

06:43.707 --> 06:46.101
What did you expect?
We're babies.

06:47.232 --> 06:48.930
I know.

06:48.973 --> 06:50.714
I can keep you guys
under control and get some
helpful advice

06:50.758 --> 06:53.195
by fast-forwarding you
to a more mature age.

06:56.546 --> 06:58.156
Okay, Titans,

06:58.200 --> 07:01.029
I need your combined wisdom
to help get us out of here.

07:01.072 --> 07:02.247
Uh, what?

07:02.291 --> 07:05.555
I said I need help
breaking down this door.

07:05.599 --> 07:06.730
What did he say?

07:06.774 --> 07:08.732
- I do not know.
- Beats me.

07:08.776 --> 07:11.256
Try speaking the up, dear.

07:13.128 --> 07:17.959
I said
I need help escaping!

07:18.002 --> 07:20.483
No, thank you.
I'd rather take a nap.

07:20.527 --> 07:22.920
Now, where's
the "Sleep" button.

07:27.577 --> 07:31.276
You know, I was once trapped
in a room just like this.

07:31.320 --> 07:32.190
How did you get out?

07:32.234 --> 07:33.931
Well, to tell you that story,

07:33.975 --> 07:35.629
I first have to tell you about
the time

07:35.672 --> 07:38.849
I took the trolley
down to the city
to buy myself a lemon.

07:38.893 --> 07:39.850
Just get to the point.

07:39.894 --> 07:41.591
Now, in those days,

07:41.635 --> 07:44.768
lemons only cost a nickel,
and ice cream only cost
a penny.

07:44.812 --> 07:47.510
I don't care much
for ice cream though
on account of my dentures.

07:49.077 --> 07:51.645
Back then, the color purple
was called strange blue.

07:51.688 --> 07:53.037
- This fella...

07:53.081 --> 07:54.952
-...in front of my house.

07:54.996 --> 07:57.738
-...on account
of my big bladder.

08:06.834 --> 08:10.664
-...and that was the time when
baseball saved Christmas.

08:10.707 --> 08:13.449
- Ugh! Just forget it.

08:15.103 --> 08:18.672
It is the okay, honey.
We can help you.

08:18.715 --> 08:19.890
Really? How?

08:19.934 --> 08:22.937
By doing what seniors do best.

08:22.980 --> 08:25.287
Criticizing your every move.

08:26.767 --> 08:29.900
No, no, no,
not like that, you dummy.

08:29.944 --> 08:32.729
You are doing it all the wrong.

08:32.773 --> 08:34.339
Would you two get off my back?

08:34.383 --> 08:36.211
Okay.

08:36.254 --> 08:38.822
But you're gonna need
more power than that
to get through that door.

08:38.866 --> 08:40.345
More power?

08:40.389 --> 08:41.259
That's it!

08:46.743 --> 08:47.657
What's goin' on?

08:47.701 --> 08:49.659
Did I pass in my sleep?

08:49.703 --> 08:52.444
No, I just hit the
"Power" button and now
we're on the "Input" screen.

08:52.488 --> 08:53.924
I'll give you some input.

08:53.968 --> 08:55.839
- You're a blockhead!
- That's it!

08:55.883 --> 08:57.624
I've had enough
of your senior sass!

08:59.321 --> 09:02.193
Now, I just need to figure out
which input reality is on.

09:02.237 --> 09:03.586
Is it HDMI1?

09:03.630 --> 09:05.240
No, that's the DVD player.

09:05.283 --> 09:06.284
HDMI2?

09:06.328 --> 09:07.982
No, that's the VCR.

09:08.025 --> 09:10.375
Will you just
hand over the remote
and let us figure it out?

09:10.419 --> 09:13.378
No, I got this situation
under control!

09:13.422 --> 09:17.252
Wait. I can get us back
by pressing the "Back" button.

09:18.732 --> 09:21.473
Oh, man, Robin just "backed" us
into my war movie.

09:21.517 --> 09:24.041
Take cover!

09:24.085 --> 09:26.740
Yeah. Just get us
out of here before we get
blown to pieces.

09:26.783 --> 09:29.003
Then, maybe
it's the "Game" button.

09:30.961 --> 09:32.397
That ain't it, bro.

09:36.140 --> 09:39.361
I know, we could escape using
"Picture-in-picture."

09:41.450 --> 09:43.452
That asteroid is gonna
hit us any moment.

09:44.845 --> 09:46.716
You got to hand over
that remote, Robin,

09:46.760 --> 09:48.892
and let us fix this
before we all die.

09:48.936 --> 09:50.807
No, I'm in control!

09:50.851 --> 09:52.635
But, every time
you try to control things,

09:52.679 --> 09:54.289
you only make 'em worse!

09:57.335 --> 10:00.817
Listen to me, Robin.
You must do the letting
of the go.

10:00.861 --> 10:03.603
Fine!

10:03.646 --> 10:06.388
Take it.

10:06.431 --> 10:08.390
Now, how're we gonna
get out of here?

10:08.433 --> 10:09.913
Try the "Rewind" button.

10:09.957 --> 10:11.828
But, that only
turned us into babies.

10:11.872 --> 10:13.613
Unless...

10:13.656 --> 10:15.310
Aim it over there, Cyborg.

10:15.353 --> 10:16.485
You got it.

10:19.357 --> 10:22.970
You're way too
out of control to be around
such sensitive material.

10:23.013 --> 10:25.712
Wait. Didn't we
do this already?

10:25.755 --> 10:27.235
It worked. We're out.

10:29.454 --> 10:30.804
Thank you, Titans.

10:30.847 --> 10:33.720
I see now that some things
are beyond my control.

10:33.763 --> 10:34.764
That's right, yo.

10:34.808 --> 10:36.636
You can't control us, fool.

10:36.679 --> 10:38.289
We are who we are.

10:38.333 --> 10:40.640
Now, we should probably put
that remote some place safe,

10:40.683 --> 10:42.119
so it won't do any more harm.

10:42.163 --> 10:44.861
But first, I think it's time
we got a little payback.

10:44.905 --> 10:46.341
- Wait, what?

10:53.609 --> 10:55.089
Goal!
