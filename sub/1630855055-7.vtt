WEBVTT

00:30.625 --> 00:32.458
Woof, woof.

00:46.333 --> 00:48.416
Police are coming.
We have to leave.

00:52.166 --> 00:53.833
- Police!
Police!

00:56.375 --> 00:57.375
Police!

00:59.458 --> 01:01.791
Go. You have to move in this direction.

01:01.791 --> 01:04.208
Move!

01:05.583 --> 01:06.541
Come here!

01:08.625 --> 01:10.833
You will come with us. Get up!

01:10.833 --> 01:13.083
- Go!
Help! Help!

01:13.083 --> 01:15.541
Catch her!
- Come here.

01:19.333 --> 01:20.416
Move!

01:29.875 --> 01:31.458
<i>This is Europe.</i>

01:31.458 --> 01:34.291
<i>Authorities in the free zone
across southern France</i>

01:34.291 --> 01:36.875
<i>are cracking down on criminal aliens</i>

01:36.875 --> 01:41.166
<i>and calling on civilians
to smoke out clusters of insurrection.</i>

01:41.166 --> 01:43.291
<i>Will the Nazis take the free zone,</i>

01:43.291 --> 01:45.708
<i>finally completing
their occupation of France?</i>

01:46.333 --> 01:50.000
<i>Will the United States join Britain
in its fight against fascism?</i>

01:50.000 --> 01:52.750
<i>Will the Yanks send mortars
to pound the Hun?</i>

01:52.750 --> 01:54.791
<i>Only time will tell.</i>

01:54.791 --> 01:57.083
Hello? Hello?

01:57.083 --> 01:58.791
Sh, nobody's there.

01:59.458 --> 02:02.208
Oh, it's the Chagalls.
We're coming right down!

02:03.458 --> 02:04.583
Thank you.

02:07.000 --> 02:07.958
Thank you.

02:10.375 --> 02:12.416
The police came to our house.

02:12.916 --> 02:15.041
We came as fast as we could.

02:15.666 --> 02:18.250
They took away
Moishe's French identity papers.

02:18.250 --> 02:19.166
Shit.

02:19.166 --> 02:21.666
Seventeen years
we've lived in this country!

02:21.666 --> 02:26.291
So many years, the French
celebrated Moishe's work, and now?

02:26.291 --> 02:28.666
Now they're trying to take away
your dignity.

02:28.666 --> 02:30.958
Uh, where is Mr. Fry?

02:30.958 --> 02:33.083
Uh, he went to town.

02:33.583 --> 02:34.791
Were you followed?

02:34.791 --> 02:37.791
- We don't know.
- No, no, no. They just let us go.

02:37.791 --> 02:40.208
Empty-handed. It was strange.

02:40.750 --> 02:43.000
The policemen were very nice to us.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.208
- Nice?
Once arrested, they were nice.

02:46.208 --> 02:48.375
- No.
- They said that they regretted it.

02:48.375 --> 02:50.375
Sure. Yeah, regret is cheap.

02:50.375 --> 02:52.541
We left all the paintings behind.

02:53.333 --> 02:54.916
His life's work.

02:55.750 --> 02:56.750
Our life.

02:57.875 --> 03:00.666
- We had no choice.
- We have to go back for them.

03:00.666 --> 03:03.666
It's much too dangerous
to go back there now.

03:03.666 --> 03:06.666
Let's find out
more information first, yeah?

03:08.000 --> 03:10.750
The French authorities,
they've been watching you for months.

03:10.750 --> 03:12.333
So, why now?

03:13.208 --> 03:14.083
Hm?

03:14.083 --> 03:16.000
Why take your papers and let you go?

03:19.291 --> 03:20.250
Huh?

03:21.625 --> 03:23.666
We need Varian. I'll look for him in town.

03:23.666 --> 03:24.875
I'll drive.

03:27.250 --> 03:29.541
No. We can't leave them here alone.

03:31.416 --> 03:32.250
Wait for me here.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.625
I've never heard of him.

03:53.250 --> 03:54.250
Okay.

03:55.625 --> 03:57.875
Yeah. [sighs] Okay. Okay.

03:59.541 --> 04:01.166
Uh, Letoret.

04:01.166 --> 04:04.541
Are we holding a visa
for someone named Otto Albert Hirschman?

04:04.541 --> 04:06.500
His sister's
calling and calling the embassy,

04:06.500 --> 04:09.250
and Vichy's saying he never picked it up.

04:10.208 --> 04:11.083
Damn it.

04:15.541 --> 04:17.000
It's gotta be here somewhere.

05:44.375 --> 05:45.791
How do I get up there?

05:47.500 --> 05:48.375
You don't.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.458
Then how do I get out of here?

05:51.000 --> 05:52.458
Passing by Dijon

05:52.458 --> 05:54.250
and directly to Germany.

05:54.250 --> 05:55.458
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

05:57.625 --> 06:00.875
Convoys of prisoners
are leaving here every few days.

06:05.375 --> 06:06.291
Bill.

06:07.208 --> 06:09.750
You're a well-connected man. Even in here?

06:12.791 --> 06:14.791
Can you get a message to my brother?

06:17.583 --> 06:18.583
Yeah, I can try.

06:20.041 --> 06:21.791
How did you end up in here anyway?

06:22.666 --> 06:24.416
I was involved with a prison break.

06:28.500 --> 06:29.500
And you?

06:30.250 --> 06:31.250
I'm a rabbi.

06:34.125 --> 06:35.000
And you?

06:37.125 --> 06:38.125
Everything else.

06:53.708 --> 06:57.000
Not now, Mr. Patterson.
We're closed. We're moving.

06:58.583 --> 07:01.541
- Where's Reese?
- Uh, I sent him home.

07:01.541 --> 07:02.916
Thought I sent <i>you</i> home.

07:03.791 --> 07:06.583
Turns out, not even the US government
has that much power.

07:07.791 --> 07:11.333
Well, it's a good thing you're here,
'cause as an ardent fan of the arts,

07:11.333 --> 07:15.541
I thought you'd enjoy
this brilliant script I just discovered.

07:17.250 --> 07:18.291
Uh...

07:19.291 --> 07:20.791
"Mary Jayne Gold."

07:21.291 --> 07:24.916
So... "It's really just a matter
of leading the British soldiers

07:24.916 --> 07:27.291
to the right place at the right time."

07:29.041 --> 07:31.083
And then there's just chatter

07:31.083 --> 07:36.833
between unidentified man one
and unidentified man two...

07:36.833 --> 07:38.708
Uh, hold on a second.

07:38.708 --> 07:39.625
Oh!

07:40.250 --> 07:41.333
Here's the best part.

07:42.083 --> 07:43.166
"Mary Jayne Gold."

07:43.875 --> 07:46.958
"You drop me off at the front gate, okay?"

07:47.458 --> 07:50.041
"I'll use Dagobert as a distraction."

07:50.583 --> 07:54.875
And then, "This is my mission,
so we'll do as I see fit."

07:56.416 --> 08:00.041
Miss Gold leading a mission
to free British POWs.

08:00.041 --> 08:04.791
Is that some sort of a joke
or an actual admission of treason?

08:06.833 --> 08:09.000
You were supposed to be
keeping an eye on her, Mr. Fry,

08:09.000 --> 08:10.625
but I guess you were too busy

08:11.416 --> 08:15.458
swanning around that villa
with your boyfriend?

08:17.791 --> 08:19.125
You placed that bug?

08:19.125 --> 08:20.500
As it happens, no.

08:21.500 --> 08:24.916
Serendipity herself dropped it
into my hands.

08:26.666 --> 08:29.916
But I will personally make sure
the right people find out about it.

08:29.916 --> 08:33.000
About everything you've been doing
in Marseille, Mr. Fry. I'll ruin--

08:33.000 --> 08:34.208
Leave him alone.

08:35.166 --> 08:37.791
Everything he does
to save desperate people

08:37.791 --> 08:39.541
shines a light on what you don't do.

08:40.041 --> 08:41.291
Who the fuck are you?

08:42.833 --> 08:44.583
You could save all of them.

08:50.416 --> 08:51.375
Get out.

08:52.333 --> 08:53.291
Patterson.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.375
I think Lena's pretty much said it all.

08:59.125 --> 08:59.958
Albert.

09:02.916 --> 09:05.375
Otto Albert Hirschman?

09:07.666 --> 09:10.875
Let me guess, unidentified man one.
Or two?

09:12.041 --> 09:12.875
What?

09:13.666 --> 09:18.000
Your sister's in a flap about your visa,
pal. You should probably go pick it up.

09:22.500 --> 09:24.125
Get out while you can.

10:02.666 --> 10:05.000
LIBERTY

10:16.083 --> 10:19.208
MESSAGE SENT

10:31.000 --> 10:33.958
I know where Paul is,
and I'm going to break him out.

10:34.875 --> 10:36.166
- Who are you?
- His little...

10:37.541 --> 10:38.500
His brother.

10:39.250 --> 10:41.833
They call me Petit,
but my name is Jacques Kandjo.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.083
I see.

10:44.083 --> 10:47.291
Petit received word Paul was
in prison at the Fort Saint-Nicolas

10:47.291 --> 10:48.875
and slated for deportation.

10:49.833 --> 10:50.666
Ah.

10:50.666 --> 10:53.000
Please, help me save my brother.

10:54.333 --> 10:55.833
How are you going to do that?

10:55.833 --> 10:57.041
I'll use his plan.

10:58.250 --> 10:59.583
Blow up train tracks?

11:00.791 --> 11:03.333
The police are using trucks now.
On backcountry roads.

11:03.333 --> 11:05.833
I know. Paul saw them with his own eyes.

11:05.833 --> 11:09.458
Albert knows exactly where the road is.
We can wait there to free Paul.

11:10.208 --> 11:12.333
And if they take a different road?

11:14.333 --> 11:15.500
You have no experience.

11:15.500 --> 11:18.125
Paul neither! Paul has never been
in a fight in his life.

11:18.750 --> 11:20.875
He's smart, sure.

11:20.875 --> 11:23.791
But for all his tough talk,
he's never even picked up a weapon.

11:24.416 --> 11:27.666
I've been in lots of fights.

11:27.666 --> 11:28.750
Have you, now?

11:30.583 --> 11:31.833
I can do this.

11:32.458 --> 11:33.708
I will get help too.

11:35.291 --> 11:36.916
But I need weapons to pull it off.

11:38.958 --> 11:40.250
Paul said you have weapons.

11:41.666 --> 11:42.750
Can I count on you?

11:47.458 --> 11:48.291
Why?

11:49.375 --> 11:50.375
Why not?

11:51.083 --> 11:53.375
Hijack a police convoy
and get yourself killed?

11:53.375 --> 11:56.000
And blow up our whole operation
in the meantime?

11:56.000 --> 11:58.041
No. You're not ready.

11:59.125 --> 12:01.416
But we owe it to him to get Paul out.

12:01.416 --> 12:02.666
We owe him nothing.

12:05.625 --> 12:09.916
Margaux, Paul was arrested
because he helped us at Camp des Milles.

12:10.416 --> 12:11.708
So, now we get burned?

12:12.208 --> 12:13.166
Think, Thomas.

12:13.666 --> 12:16.750
Our lives, our identities, our goals.

12:16.750 --> 12:20.500
We can't risk all that now.
Not when we have a war to win.

12:20.500 --> 12:21.875
But what about Paul?

12:28.875 --> 12:29.875
Thanks.

12:35.291 --> 12:38.250
We have visas. Can you
take us on the next boat to New York?

12:38.250 --> 12:40.333
That is the problem. There are no boats,

12:40.333 --> 12:43.958
and your visas are no good
without the correct identity papers.

12:43.958 --> 12:47.458
See, this is why Varian has been
trying to get you to go to safety

12:47.458 --> 12:49.583
since he arrived in France.

12:49.583 --> 12:52.625
- We weren't ready. Now we are ready.
- We're not ready.

12:52.625 --> 12:55.625
Please, Moishe, my love.
Let me handle this. You're too upset.

12:56.750 --> 12:59.916
I will not leave France
without my paintings.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.833
- Which way does the sun set?
- I don't know.

13:05.083 --> 13:08.458
- Monsieur Chagall. Madame Chagall.
- Thank God you're here.

13:10.750 --> 13:12.958
I need to talk with you. After this.

13:14.416 --> 13:16.541
- Hey. Please have a seat.
Hi.

13:25.583 --> 13:28.125
They've raided the beach
and the Pelican, too,

13:28.125 --> 13:31.041
and I think they've even got Bill Freier.
He's gone missing.

13:31.041 --> 13:32.791
- We have to get out of here.
- How?

13:32.791 --> 13:35.500
At this point,
we can't even get the Chagalls on a boat.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.625
I sold my plane last summer
to a local bureaucrat

13:39.625 --> 13:41.541
to raise money for the ERC.

13:41.541 --> 13:44.375
I gave him a very good price,
so he owes me.

13:44.875 --> 13:49.208
If he can fly us to Lisbon,
then we can get to the United States.

13:49.208 --> 13:52.000
I'll arrange everything,
and my father will pay for it.

13:52.500 --> 13:55.875
- But I thought he cut you off.
- He's gonna pay to get me home.

13:55.875 --> 13:58.916
- With a refugee in your pocket?
- With my husband.

14:02.000 --> 14:02.833
You do realize

14:02.833 --> 14:05.958
that I carry pretty much everything
I own on my back right now?

14:05.958 --> 14:08.875
If I wanted to marry a man
for his possessions

14:08.875 --> 14:13.666
instead of his convictions, I'd already
be married to some jerk in Chicago.

14:19.208 --> 14:22.708
My sister Ursula
got me a visa to the United States.

14:25.583 --> 14:26.416
When?

14:27.458 --> 14:29.625
It came through a few weeks ago. I...

14:31.083 --> 14:33.458
I just never picked it up
from the US consulate.

14:33.458 --> 14:34.541
Why?

14:37.000 --> 14:39.625
We have to go get it.
Let's go get your things

14:39.625 --> 14:42.208
and pick up the visa
before it's too late, all right?

14:43.583 --> 14:44.458
Okay.

15:07.291 --> 15:09.333
Albert, you saved me a trip. Look.

15:10.666 --> 15:12.208
Look what's in the latest issue.

15:12.208 --> 15:14.916
- Mary Jayne's waiting for me downstairs.
- Look at it.

15:21.916 --> 15:23.708
Huh?
Look. Ouidah!

15:24.208 --> 15:25.291
It's a message.

15:27.166 --> 15:29.250
Paul's in prison in Fort Saint-Nicolas?

15:31.166 --> 15:33.541
He could be deported
any minute to the Reich.

15:33.541 --> 15:34.875
Not if we get to him first.

15:34.875 --> 15:37.625
I already spoke to your man Thomas
and that woman Margaux.

15:37.625 --> 15:39.416
- Uh-huh.
- They won't help us.

15:40.500 --> 15:43.666
I will find out what I can about the fort.
But we need you.

15:49.333 --> 15:50.250
Hey.

15:52.875 --> 15:55.166
- Okay, I'll see you later.
- See you.

15:57.666 --> 16:00.500
We have to get Petit back to the villa
to speak with Hans.

16:00.500 --> 16:02.166
What about the consulate?

16:02.166 --> 16:03.625
This is more important.

16:04.958 --> 16:05.958
Paul's alive.

16:07.666 --> 16:10.791
We must save my brother
from deportation. Maybe death.

16:15.583 --> 16:18.791
I'm afraid there's not much to eat,
but there's always wine.

16:19.291 --> 16:20.208
Wine is good.

16:20.708 --> 16:21.708
Oh!

16:22.291 --> 16:23.333
We have these.

16:23.833 --> 16:27.250
People always bringing
chocolates for the maestro.

16:42.125 --> 16:43.125
Albert.

16:43.958 --> 16:45.791
- Petit.
I need to speak with you.

16:46.291 --> 16:47.208
Not you.

16:48.750 --> 16:51.375
Paul's being held in the prison
where Lisa and I were held.

16:51.375 --> 16:52.291
Really?

16:53.125 --> 16:53.958
And now?

16:54.666 --> 16:55.500
Can we get him out?

16:57.166 --> 16:58.208
We're gonna try.

16:59.125 --> 16:59.958
I'll help.

17:01.500 --> 17:02.583
Let's go inside.

17:14.083 --> 17:16.750
- I wanna help too.
- They don't want your help.

17:18.166 --> 17:19.166
Help me.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.333
Let's go get Chagall's artwork.

17:21.333 --> 17:23.791
- They're not leaving without it.
- That's a good idea.

17:23.791 --> 17:25.375
- Can we have your car keys?
- Yes.

17:25.375 --> 17:26.916
- But...
Come on.

17:31.416 --> 17:33.000
Do you know how to drive, Varian?

17:34.250 --> 17:35.708
I'm from New Jersey.

17:41.333 --> 17:42.958
I've had it with this stupid thing.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.791
Trucks are leaving the prison
every few days.

17:48.791 --> 17:51.375
We have to get him out
before he's put on a truck.

17:51.375 --> 17:53.458
- That prison is a fortress.
Right.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.250
We have to stop the truck
once it's out of the city.

17:58.250 --> 18:00.416
Release Paul and all the comrades inside.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.583
It's easy enough to block the road.
There's no traffic.

18:04.583 --> 18:08.500
Two of us can charge the driver,
while two more open up the back.

18:08.500 --> 18:09.791
Unarmed?

18:09.791 --> 18:14.833
- It could work. They won't expect us.
- We are dead on arrival without weapons.

18:15.333 --> 18:16.250
He's right.

18:16.916 --> 18:20.125
We need to get our hands on
one or two guns.

18:20.125 --> 18:23.083
I'm sorry.
When is the next convoy leaving?

18:23.083 --> 18:25.125
Touré will find out
which truck Paul is on.

18:25.125 --> 18:29.958
And then what? You're just waiting
in the middle of the road for it?

18:29.958 --> 18:32.458
That could take hours.
That could take days.

18:33.375 --> 18:35.791
Why don't I talk to the guards?
I could try and pay them off.

18:35.791 --> 18:39.083
- I mean, that worked last summer.
- Last summer was a lifetime ago.

18:39.583 --> 18:42.708
Last summer, they arrested me
for trying to stow away on a boat.

18:43.208 --> 18:44.666
Now there are no boats.

18:45.166 --> 18:48.458
Now they're arresting people
in the streets for doing nothing.

18:51.375 --> 18:53.791
The time for bribing guards has passed.

18:55.791 --> 18:57.208
We have to take a stand.

18:58.250 --> 18:59.250
I agree.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.083
The next convoy leaves tomorrow,
early morning.

19:08.708 --> 19:10.666
Paul will be among the prisoners.

19:39.916 --> 19:42.458
Let's get everything out
before the police come back.

19:53.500 --> 19:55.375
We could just keep driving.

19:57.708 --> 19:58.541
Together.

20:00.166 --> 20:01.166
And go where?

20:02.708 --> 20:03.708
Not Paris.

20:05.208 --> 20:06.083
No.

20:07.583 --> 20:08.583
Not Rome.

20:12.166 --> 20:13.166
Not Jerusalem.

20:15.458 --> 20:18.208
Our Berlin is long gone.

20:25.708 --> 20:27.125
What if we just stayed here?

20:31.916 --> 20:35.000
Two bachelors.
Nice garden. A couple sheep.

20:41.625 --> 20:42.458
Why not?

20:47.208 --> 20:49.208
Well, for starters,

20:50.166 --> 20:51.291
I'm not a bachelor.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.083
Then free your wife
to find someone who can love her fully...

21:01.833 --> 21:03.166
and stay here with me.

21:07.083 --> 21:08.541
What exactly are we doing here?

21:09.041 --> 21:12.083
- We're packing up Marc Chagall's artwork.
You're a brave man.

21:12.083 --> 21:15.083
Only the bravest of men will come
all the way over to Europe

21:15.083 --> 21:16.375
to save the lives of strangers.

21:16.375 --> 21:18.541
- Thomas...
- What about saving your own life?

21:20.458 --> 21:21.458
I'm done hiding.

21:23.291 --> 21:24.166
Varian.

21:25.500 --> 21:27.291
Personally and professionally.

21:30.333 --> 21:32.000
I've had enough of the lies.

21:33.416 --> 21:34.500
And the secrets.

21:37.666 --> 21:39.208
Enough of the loneliness.

21:44.958 --> 21:46.416
Even men like us...

21:49.166 --> 21:50.875
even we deserve to be happy.

21:55.333 --> 21:56.916
Happiness is complicated.

21:59.708 --> 22:00.625
Is it?

22:02.000 --> 22:04.916
When you're in my arms,
it doesn't feel complicated at all.

22:26.250 --> 22:28.500
It's a suicide mission.
Listen.

22:29.583 --> 22:30.625
Call your guy.

22:30.625 --> 22:31.625
Book the plane.

22:31.625 --> 22:33.791
Once Paul is free, I am all yours.

22:33.791 --> 22:34.708
I promise.

22:34.708 --> 22:36.125
Chicago, here we come.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.333
- Are you just saying this to shut me up?
- I'm saying it because I mean it.

22:41.250 --> 22:42.083
Come here.

22:46.500 --> 22:48.875
I want to start
a new life in America with you.

22:51.166 --> 22:52.500
I cannot wait

22:53.458 --> 22:55.416
to start a new life in America with you.

22:56.500 --> 22:59.333
And you know that I'm not asking you
to give up the fight?

22:59.333 --> 23:00.541
I know that.

23:01.666 --> 23:04.541
And I know we'll find
new ways to fight the fascists from there,

23:04.541 --> 23:08.375
and we might even just be more effective
coming at it from the outside.

23:09.750 --> 23:13.166
I can't leave until Paul is free.

23:13.166 --> 23:15.291
I know, but...

23:18.375 --> 23:20.166
You can't go in there unarmed.

23:22.291 --> 23:23.166
Yeah.

23:24.666 --> 23:25.500
I...

23:26.041 --> 23:28.875
I know where
some British weapons are buried.

23:31.166 --> 23:32.375
- What?
- Yeah.

24:26.958 --> 24:28.541
I'll meet you downstairs.

24:29.666 --> 24:30.666
We can stop.

24:32.791 --> 24:34.333
I don't care who hears us.

25:16.625 --> 25:17.750
Come on, get up!

25:18.375 --> 25:19.333
Out!

25:48.458 --> 25:49.666
Miss Gold.

25:51.458 --> 25:52.916
What brings you here?

25:52.916 --> 25:56.291
I'm here to pick up a visa
for Otto Albert Hirschman.

25:57.583 --> 25:59.875
Mr. Patterson has it in his office.

26:01.083 --> 26:02.000
Please.

26:08.791 --> 26:11.291
What do we have here?
Come in. Come in.

26:15.375 --> 26:16.875
The walls have ears.

26:18.125 --> 26:20.750
Turns out my secretary
works for the Gestapo.

26:22.041 --> 26:23.500
Mademoiselle Letoret?

26:23.500 --> 26:27.500
She's a really good secretary too.
Maybe they all work for the Gestapo.

26:33.416 --> 26:35.750
Your father know about
Otto Albert Hirschman?

26:37.166 --> 26:40.708
Young, energetic guy like that
probably has a great future in America.

26:40.708 --> 26:43.083
Pretty soon,
even your father will love him.

26:47.375 --> 26:48.958
How long you think before he leaves you?

26:51.500 --> 26:53.833
What is he?
Twenty-four years old? Twenty-five?

26:55.541 --> 26:58.041
He's got his whole future ahead of him.
Whereas you...

27:00.708 --> 27:02.250
A boy like that?

27:03.208 --> 27:06.208
His wings have been clipped
by circumstances from the get-go.

27:06.708 --> 27:09.500
Just wait till he gets to America
and learns to fly.

27:10.625 --> 27:12.416
What is that supposed to mean?

27:13.166 --> 27:16.541
Somehow, I don't see him sticking around
the backwaters of Lake Michigan

27:16.541 --> 27:18.666
to play golf.

27:21.875 --> 27:22.916
Are you finished?

27:26.916 --> 27:27.833
Not quite.

27:30.875 --> 27:35.041
I have it on record that
you, Mary Jayne, an American citizen,

27:35.041 --> 27:38.208
have been working with
British intelligence here on French soil,

27:38.208 --> 27:40.583
which, as I'm sure you know, is illegal.

27:40.583 --> 27:44.541
If you don't get the hell out of my hair
and out of Marseille as soon as possible,

27:44.541 --> 27:49.125
I'm gonna make it my personal mission
to make sure you get tried for treason.

27:57.916 --> 27:59.333
Now I'm finished.

28:44.083 --> 28:46.583
Thank you for coming.
- How could I say no?

28:47.166 --> 28:51.750
So the Chagalls have visas, thankfully,
but no boats, no identity papers.

28:51.750 --> 28:53.750
- Are they ready to go?
- They're all packed up.

28:54.625 --> 28:56.500
All right.

28:57.416 --> 29:00.208
I might just have one last good idea.

29:03.666 --> 29:07.125
That one with the diplomatic plates.
You'll get over the border unchecked.

29:07.666 --> 29:09.666
You stick this screwdriver
into the key lock,

29:09.666 --> 29:13.208
and then press the lever at the same time
as the accelerator. All right?

29:30.958 --> 29:33.333
Mr. Bingham?
- I left my family photographs inside.

29:33.333 --> 29:35.458
Can you believe it?
It'll just take me a second.

29:35.458 --> 29:37.375
- No. I do it.
- You don't know where they are.

29:37.375 --> 29:38.541
Mr. Bingham!

30:02.666 --> 30:06.291
<i>A green caravan
swimming in a mountain river.</i>

30:08.125 --> 30:10.625
<i>Rainbow chess pieces light fire.</i>

30:11.625 --> 30:14.333
<i>Kittens rush from a basket</i>

30:14.333 --> 30:16.333
<i>and sleep softly in the sun.</i>

30:17.208 --> 30:18.208
<i>Beware!</i>

31:37.291 --> 31:38.833
Go see what's going on.

31:42.916 --> 31:45.625
Out of the car!
Get out of the car!

31:46.333 --> 31:47.583
Get out of the car!

31:49.125 --> 31:50.125
Down!

31:50.125 --> 31:51.083
On the ground!

31:52.625 --> 31:55.166
On the ground! Out of the car.

31:55.166 --> 31:56.291
Give me your weapon.

31:57.666 --> 32:01.000
Out of the car.
Here. Go here. Down! Down!

32:01.000 --> 32:03.750
- Down!
- Put the gun down! Go on the ground.

32:03.750 --> 32:05.000
Go on the ground.

32:09.500 --> 32:10.416
Quick!

32:13.291 --> 32:15.166
Bastard.
Don't move.

32:15.166 --> 32:17.750
That's enough!
Don't move. Don't move.

32:21.500 --> 32:22.791
- Almost there.
- Lie down.

32:22.791 --> 32:26.750
Don't shoot.

32:27.333 --> 32:28.166
Brother.

32:28.166 --> 32:29.500
My little brother.

32:32.416 --> 32:34.500
What does he say?
- Bless your strength.

32:38.875 --> 32:40.416
Don't move!

32:44.333 --> 32:45.500
My little brother.

32:46.166 --> 32:48.541
My little brother.

32:49.166 --> 32:51.583
Breathe. Try to breathe. Try to breathe.

32:53.041 --> 32:54.750
Breathe. It's gonna be okay.

32:59.875 --> 33:02.875
My little brother.

33:05.833 --> 33:09.083
My little brother, stay with me.

33:12.541 --> 33:14.250
My little brother, stay with me.

33:17.625 --> 33:19.125
My little brother, stay with me.

33:20.916 --> 33:23.708
My little brother!

34:54.875 --> 34:56.083
Madame Chagall.

34:57.583 --> 34:58.541
Let's go.

35:02.333 --> 35:04.666
- Right now!
- I'll wake Monsieur Chagall.

35:08.750 --> 35:10.208
- Where's Thomas?
Inside.

35:10.208 --> 35:11.750
- Do you want me to get him?
- No.

35:12.916 --> 35:14.000
- Listen.
- What?

35:16.500 --> 35:18.000
I'm gonna drive them over myself.

35:19.125 --> 35:20.000
To Spain?

35:20.000 --> 35:22.833
To Lisbon, and then, uh,
I'm gonna sail with them to New York.

35:24.916 --> 35:25.875
But what about...

35:27.666 --> 35:29.375
It's not gonna work in real life.

35:29.875 --> 35:32.000
No, but this <i>is</i> real life.

35:34.000 --> 35:34.916
It's not.

35:38.625 --> 35:40.666
But I've never felt so alive.

35:41.833 --> 35:43.083
Yeah, me neither.

35:54.958 --> 35:55.791
Varian.

36:02.833 --> 36:04.458
Can you help me with the paintings?

36:16.375 --> 36:18.583
- Where's Bingham?
- Uh, he's not here.

36:22.791 --> 36:24.500
Then who's driving this thing?

36:33.875 --> 36:36.416
By the time you cross the border,
they'll know you took the car.

36:36.416 --> 36:38.708
- It's the only way.
- You'll be expatriated.

36:38.708 --> 36:41.208
- Or arrested. They won't let you back.
- I have to help them.

36:41.208 --> 36:42.208
No, you don't.

36:42.833 --> 36:44.916
Don't make this about the Chagalls.

36:46.750 --> 36:48.708
Here we are. Let's go.

37:06.375 --> 37:08.166
- Varian.

37:13.750 --> 37:14.750
I'm very sorry.

37:44.958 --> 37:47.708
I thought
that we would live here forever.

37:50.666 --> 37:52.083
For a moment, so did I.

38:14.333 --> 38:16.083
Is there anything we can say?

38:20.208 --> 38:21.083
Praying?

38:22.041 --> 38:22.875
Anything?

40:51.083 --> 40:52.208
Mary Jayne!

40:53.416 --> 40:54.416
Mary Jayne!

40:55.958 --> 40:56.958
She's gone.

41:00.250 --> 41:01.583
Mary Jayne!

41:28.958 --> 41:30.333
You've done good work here.

41:57.583 --> 41:58.666
Come on, Dagobert.

42:30.791 --> 42:31.916
Mary Jayne!

42:42.208 --> 42:43.875
What happened? Are you okay?

42:45.916 --> 42:47.791
You made it. You made it.

43:00.666 --> 43:01.666
I just...

43:03.708 --> 43:06.416
I couldn't let you go
without saying goodbye.

44:53.541 --> 44:55.083
Come on. Open the damn gate.

45:24.875 --> 45:26.625
Stolen? A limousine?

45:26.625 --> 45:27.875
From under my nose.

45:28.791 --> 45:31.708
- And Monsieur Fry was driving?
Can you catch him?

45:32.666 --> 45:34.250
Uh, maybe, yes.

45:40.500 --> 45:42.500
Or maybe we just let him go.

45:43.083 --> 45:44.166
What?

45:44.166 --> 45:46.416
Get another limousine.

45:46.958 --> 45:48.916
Forget about the car.
What about the people?

45:48.916 --> 45:51.291
They're criminals and degenerates.

45:51.291 --> 45:52.875
Yes, of course, they are.

45:53.500 --> 45:54.500
But...

45:55.958 --> 45:58.708
but, uh, now, finally...

46:00.708 --> 46:02.750
they are somebody else's problem.

46:10.250 --> 46:11.750
Good night, Mr. Patterson.
