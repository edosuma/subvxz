00:14.640 --> 00:18.310
The Massachusetts Law Society
is so looking forward to your speech.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.187
They triple confirmed with me
that you were coming.

00:20.270 --> 00:24.358
I'm sorry. I'm just a bit preoccupied
with family matters.

00:24.441 --> 00:28.237
This wouldn't have anything to do
with why none of your family was present

00:28.320 --> 00:30.572
at the memorial for young Stearns,
would it?

00:30.656 --> 00:33.784
Sadly, yes. My son is behaving abominably,

00:33.867 --> 00:39.248
my wife has taken to bed,
and now even Emily is upset with me.

00:39.957 --> 00:43.460
Emily. Well…
She's always been a bit of a handful.

00:43.961 --> 00:46.588
Bit of a wild child, that one.

00:46.672 --> 00:47.673
I suppose.

00:47.756 --> 00:51.760
Well, I was going to keep this part
a secret till we got to Boston.

00:51.844 --> 00:54.888
But you look like someone
who might welcome some good news.

00:54.972 --> 00:56.014
What's that?

00:56.098 --> 00:57.224
Edward Dickinson,

00:57.307 --> 01:01.812
you won't just be giving a speech
at the Law Society tonight.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.814
In fact, you'll be greeted

01:03.897 --> 01:07.317
by the leaders
of the Massachusetts Republican Party,

01:07.401 --> 01:12.322
who plan to offer you the nomination
for the next Lieutenant Governor.

01:12.406 --> 01:13.407
Lieutenant Governor?

01:14.491 --> 01:16.535
-It's an honor.
-Indeed it is.

01:16.618 --> 01:19.037
I am thrilled
to get you back into politics

01:19.121 --> 01:22.541
and to leave
your stuffy Whig days behind you.

01:22.624 --> 01:25.919
Edward, think of it.
You'll be a Republican.

01:26.003 --> 01:28.797
At last,
you'll be on the right side of history.

01:28.881 --> 01:30.632
I'm afraid I cannot accept.

01:31.216 --> 01:34.219
Edward, you were made for this position.

01:34.303 --> 01:36.013
You are a pillar of Amherst,

01:36.096 --> 01:40.058
which is now one of the most pro-abolition
townships in the whole state.

01:40.142 --> 01:43.395
And you have a measured
and traditional approach to the law.

01:43.478 --> 01:47.691
I may have the credentials,
but I don't have the desire.

01:48.567 --> 01:53.155
I need to be in Amherst with my family,
not in Boston with Republicans.

01:54.406 --> 01:56.158
I beg you to take a moment to consider--

01:56.241 --> 01:58.952
My decision is final.

02:02.789 --> 02:04.791
-Geez.
-Stop the carriage!

02:06.502 --> 02:08.669
-What is this?
-I'm letting you out.

02:09.295 --> 02:11.590
Here? We're halfway to Boston.

02:11.673 --> 02:13.509
What about the meeting at the Law Society?

02:13.592 --> 02:16.512
-Edward, you never cease to disappoint me.
-Oh, God.

02:16.595 --> 02:21.683
You are a backwards-thinking,
stuck-in-the-mud, stuffy, old Whig.

02:21.767 --> 02:25.229
You simply cannot accept that the life
of this country is moving on.

02:25.312 --> 02:30.067
So I suppose that means
it will have to move on without you.

02:30.150 --> 02:34.279
So, get out. Now!

02:38.617 --> 02:42.788
-Edward Dickinson, you are a coward.
-What?

02:42.871 --> 02:45.290
And a milksop.

02:45.374 --> 02:47.626
And a mouse!

02:47.709 --> 02:49.837
-How?
-Now, driver!

02:51.296 --> 02:52.297
Conkey.

02:56.093 --> 02:57.094
Yes.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.805
All right, I am a mouse.

03:01.682 --> 03:04.309
But I need to get home
to my little mouse family.

03:27.916 --> 03:30.586
To know the worst
leaves no dread more -

03:31.628 --> 03:33.630
I wonder what she wants
to talk to us about.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.841
I don't know, but I guess it's urgent.

03:35.924 --> 03:38.135
I got a box
with a piece of cake inside of it

03:38.218 --> 03:40.470
on top of a note card
that said, "This is urgent."

03:40.554 --> 03:42.472
Yeah, I got one too.

03:45.142 --> 03:46.143
There she is.

03:46.810 --> 03:49.771
Emily. You wanted to see us?

03:50.772 --> 03:52.482
Brother, sister.

03:53.317 --> 03:57.196
Yes, I summoned you.
Thank you for heeding the call.

03:57.279 --> 03:58.822
Why is she talking like that?

03:58.906 --> 04:02.576
I summoned you because we have
a matter of great urgency to discuss,

04:02.659 --> 04:07.247
something that concerns the three of us
and our mutual future as siblings.

04:07.331 --> 04:09.541
Call it a sibling summit, if you will.

04:09.625 --> 04:11.877
-I will.
-I have no idea what's happening.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.922
William Austin Dickinson,
despite your recent efforts

04:15.005 --> 04:17.798
to establish a distance
between yourself and this family,

04:17.882 --> 04:22.721
the fact remains that no such separation
has officially or legally been created.

04:22.804 --> 04:26.975
Therefore, the family,
effectively and forthwith, remains intact.

04:27.518 --> 04:30.479
-Hence, consequently, and ergo--
-Ergo?

04:30.562 --> 04:35.108
Ergo, you are still our brother.
And you are still our father's only son.

04:35.192 --> 04:36.193
What in the world?

04:36.276 --> 04:39.154
Emily, whatever it is you're trying
to say, can you say it in a way

04:39.238 --> 04:42.157
that doesn't sound like we're on trial
for some very boring crime?

04:42.241 --> 04:45.118
Okay. Dad asked me
to be the executor of his will,

04:45.202 --> 04:49.081
and it turns out he is giving
everything to Austin, including us.

04:49.164 --> 04:50.415
What do you mean "including us"?

04:50.499 --> 04:53.418
When Dad dies,
Austin becomes our guardian.

04:53.502 --> 04:57.673
He gets the house, all the assets and us.
We are just another piece of property.

05:01.593 --> 05:04.429
Well, I mean, yeah. I figured.

05:04.513 --> 05:07.182
When you don't have a husband
and your father dies,

05:07.266 --> 05:09.226
you belong to your brother.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.186
It is a patriarchy after all.

05:11.687 --> 05:13.856
Okay. Well, I am not just gonna sit here

05:13.939 --> 05:15.983
and let my brother
take control of my life.

05:16.066 --> 05:17.526
I don't want to control your life.

05:17.609 --> 05:19.570
I don't even want to be
a part of this family.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.238
Dad messed all of us up.

05:21.321 --> 05:24.366
And I've got my hands full
dealing with my own personal trauma.

05:25.909 --> 05:28.245
-Yes, about that.
-Okay.

05:28.871 --> 05:33.292
Austin, you have spent
the past few months, shall we say,

05:33.375 --> 05:37.838
drawing our attention to all the ways
in which our father has failed us.

05:37.921 --> 05:41.258
And I am ready to admit now
that you were right.

05:41.341 --> 05:42.551
About what?

05:42.634 --> 05:46.013
Our father has been
a tremendous disappointment.

05:46.096 --> 05:49.224
-Yes.
-He has behaved exactly and at all times

05:49.308 --> 05:52.394
in accordance with contemporary
social expectations and norms,

05:52.477 --> 05:54.438
which is to say, he's been a real asshole.

05:54.521 --> 05:57.608
Yes, well, I'm glad you can see that now.

05:57.691 --> 05:58.775
I can.

05:59.985 --> 06:03.697
You were right. I was wrong.
I should've never chosen him over you.

06:05.240 --> 06:06.241
Wow.

06:06.992 --> 06:09.494
Okay. Thank you.

06:10.913 --> 06:12.206
And yet, here we are.

06:13.081 --> 06:16.627
With you next in line
to his patrimonial throne.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.754
And the two of us, powerless.

06:18.837 --> 06:21.173
-Your subjects.
-I truly don't see you that way.

06:21.256 --> 06:22.925
Which is why we are having
this conversation.

06:23.008 --> 06:26.386
-I need you to make a promise to us.
-What promise?

06:26.470 --> 06:29.431
That you will not allow history
to repeat itself.

06:29.515 --> 06:31.725
What exactly do you mean?

06:31.808 --> 06:35.354
The past is the past. It's gone.

06:35.437 --> 06:37.439
And there is nothing we can do
to change it.

06:38.148 --> 06:40.859
But if we are willing to face the past,

06:40.943 --> 06:45.572
then maybe-- maybe there is something
we can do about the future.

06:45.656 --> 06:49.409
So, Austin, will you promise us

06:50.202 --> 06:52.663
that you will not be
the same kind of man our father was…

06:54.164 --> 06:56.625
that no matter
what the laws of society say,

06:56.708 --> 06:59.294
as long as we live together,
you will treat us with respect

06:59.378 --> 07:03.423
and you will give us the freedom,
all the freedom that we deserve?

07:03.507 --> 07:05.050
Sisters…

07:07.094 --> 07:08.303
you can count on me.

07:09.721 --> 07:10.931
All right.

07:12.349 --> 07:13.350
On one condition.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.434
What?

07:14.518 --> 07:15.853
Vinnie has to get rid of her cats.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.771
-I agree. I hate those cats.
-No!

07:17.855 --> 07:19.606
-Just am not a cat person.
-Yeah, me neither.

07:19.690 --> 07:21.525
I am not getting rid of my cats, you guys.

07:21.608 --> 07:25.362
Vinnie, we spend $36 a week on milk
and cream. We can't afford that.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.781
Question: What is your position on foxes?

07:27.865 --> 07:30.117
-What?
-Never mind. It's not up to you.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.661
We are independent women, and you
just promised to always respect that.

07:32.744 --> 07:35.539
We will go over the details later?
Should we shake on it?

07:38.625 --> 07:39.626
Okay, I want to.

07:39.710 --> 07:40.711
Love you, big bro.

07:40.794 --> 07:41.795
I love you guys.

07:43.672 --> 07:46.675
It's honestly weird
not to be drowning in grief for a moment.

07:49.553 --> 07:52.848
Making the world a better place
one Dickinson at a time.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.733
Okay, Mom. Up and at 'em.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.902
It is a brand-new day. It's beautiful.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.528
And it's time for you to get out of bed.

08:06.612 --> 08:08.071
Leave me alone.

08:08.155 --> 08:11.283
Nope. I am here to cheer you up
and comfort you,

08:11.366 --> 08:13.285
whether you like it or not.

08:13.368 --> 08:15.162
Please don't jostle me.

08:15.245 --> 08:16.955
Mom, you need to be jostled.

08:17.039 --> 08:19.541
You have been in bed for over a week.

08:20.125 --> 08:22.461
I can't just let you lie here
and die of sadness.

08:22.544 --> 08:24.755
Plus, the house-- the house is dusty.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.758
We need you back on broom duty.
You're the broom queen.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.635
Flattery isn't going to work.

08:30.385 --> 08:32.596
I'm simply too riddled with grief
to go on living.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.932
There's a hole in my heart
that's never going to be filled.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.015
Could we talk about it?

08:36.099 --> 08:39.852
The only person I wanna talk to
is my sister Lavinia. And she's gone.

08:39.937 --> 08:43.398
You know, even when people die,
their spirits can stay with us.

08:43.482 --> 08:46.818
I'm telling you, I saw the spirit
of Aunt Lavinia at her funeral,

08:46.902 --> 08:48.153
in the shape of a bird.

08:48.237 --> 08:51.114
Come on. That's impossible.
She hated birds.

08:51.198 --> 08:55.452
-She did? I never knew that.
-Nobody knew my sister as well as I did.

08:55.536 --> 08:58.372
Nobody loved her like I did.
I miss her so much.

08:58.455 --> 08:59.873
Tell me what you miss.

09:00.582 --> 09:02.042
Everything.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.961
You know what I was thinking about today?

09:04.044 --> 09:07.840
The way she would slip her hand into mine
whenever we were next to each other.

09:07.923 --> 09:11.510
She did it ever since we were children.
No thought to it.

09:11.593 --> 09:14.680
Just as if we were meant to be conjoined.

09:14.763 --> 09:16.139
Go on. What else?

09:16.223 --> 09:18.809
The sound of her voice,
the jokes we shared,

09:18.892 --> 09:20.686
the way she could make me laugh.

09:20.769 --> 09:24.398
We always spoke the same language.
We were cut from the same cloth.

09:24.481 --> 09:27.734
She was at once part of me
and the person I wanted to be.

09:28.652 --> 09:30.237
That's having a sister, I guess.

09:30.320 --> 09:33.532
Yeah. I'm glad I have one.

09:34.116 --> 09:38.287
You and Lavinia are so lucky to be
growing old together under the same roof.

09:38.370 --> 09:40.372
I wish I had that experience,

09:40.455 --> 09:42.791
instead of leaving home as young as I did.

09:42.875 --> 09:45.502
Honestly,
sometimes I'm envious of you girls.

09:46.128 --> 09:48.172
Mom, I didn't know you felt that way.

09:50.591 --> 09:54.386
Your relationship with your sister
is the most precious one.

09:54.970 --> 09:58.140
Be grateful for every moment you share,

09:58.223 --> 10:00.809
because, one day,
she won't be there anymore.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.730
Mom, when was the last time
you cleaned this place?

10:04.813 --> 10:08.150
I don't know. Feels like forever. Why?

10:10.194 --> 10:10.819
Because I--

10:12.529 --> 10:14.198
I think I just saw a mouse!

10:14.281 --> 10:16.575
-Mouse? There's a mouse in my bedroom?
-Yes. Yes.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.077
Where is it? Where did it go?

10:19.995 --> 10:22.080
I just saw it. It's over there.
It ran into the corner.

10:22.164 --> 10:25.375
How is it that Vinnie has 500 cats,
and we still get mice?

10:25.459 --> 10:27.961
Haven't you girls been cleaning at all?
The house must be filthy.

10:28.045 --> 10:29.546
I'll get a broom. I'll chase it.

10:29.630 --> 10:31.673
-No. I just had a thought.
-What thought?

10:31.757 --> 10:34.593
My sister, your Aunt Lavinia,
she hated birds…

10:34.676 --> 10:37.387
-Yes, you mentioned that.
-…but she loved mice.

10:37.471 --> 10:38.847
She used to keep them as pets.

10:38.931 --> 10:42.893
She'd feed them cheese and name them after
all of her favorite fairy tale characters.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.479
-Rapunzel, Rumpelstiltskin, Snow White.
-Cute.

10:45.562 --> 10:48.482
And sometimes, she'd play pranks on me
because she knew I was afraid of mice.

10:48.565 --> 10:50.692
-Once, she put one in my bed.
-Okay, rude.

10:50.776 --> 10:52.027
Emily, don't you see?

10:52.110 --> 10:54.613
That mouse,
I believe it's the ghost of Aunt Lavinia.

10:57.199 --> 10:58.200
Oh, my God.

10:59.243 --> 11:00.244
Mom, I think you're right.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.120
I'd know the ghost of my sister anywhere.

11:02.746 --> 11:04.498
That mouse has her exact vibe.

11:06.917 --> 11:08.210
I got her.

11:08.293 --> 11:10.462
Aunt Vinnie, is that you?

11:10.546 --> 11:12.589
-Don't hurt her.
-I'm not gonna hurt her.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.132
Mom, Aunt Vinnie is here with us.

11:15.092 --> 11:18.220
She's here to listen
to whatever you need to tell her.

11:19.555 --> 11:20.556
Go ahead.

11:23.934 --> 11:25.310
Sister?

11:27.020 --> 11:28.814
Sweet Vinnie, is that really you?

11:31.483 --> 11:34.069
Talk to her, Mom. Let it out.

11:36.905 --> 11:39.324
I'm sorry that I left home so young.

11:40.868 --> 11:43.954
I'm sorry that we didn't have the chance
to grow old together.

11:46.415 --> 11:49.459
I'm sorry that having husbands
and children kept us apart.

11:49.543 --> 11:51.461
Keep going.
Mom, this is helping. I can feel it.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.342
You were the best friend I ever had.

11:58.927 --> 12:02.139
And I'll miss you every day
for the rest of my life.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.814
And now I'll let you go.

12:17.654 --> 12:19.239
There she goes.

12:22.492 --> 12:24.620
Those were the things
I wanted to say at her funeral,

12:24.703 --> 12:26.330
but I didn't get the chance to.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.248
She's heard you say them now.

12:28.332 --> 12:30.459
My heart still has a hole in it.

12:31.293 --> 12:33.754
But now there's
a little mouse that lives in the hole.

12:33.837 --> 12:35.214
Mom, that is so beautiful.

12:36.590 --> 12:38.217
I think I might put that in a poem.

12:38.300 --> 12:41.261
Really? That would make me very happy.

12:43.639 --> 12:47.559
Right. Time to get dressed
and sweep every inch of this house.

12:47.643 --> 12:50.729
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mrs. Dickinson is back!

13:01.198 --> 13:04.910
Austin. Good. You're here.
I just brought out the tea.

13:04.993 --> 13:06.161
Is somebody here?

13:06.245 --> 13:09.581
Yes. George Gould. He came to see you.

13:10.290 --> 13:14.127
George. Why are using
the fancy tea service for George?

13:15.003 --> 13:16.171
Hey, buddy.

13:17.005 --> 13:18.674
I came to say goodbye.

13:18.757 --> 13:19.758
George.

13:20.384 --> 13:21.677
A uniform.

13:22.719 --> 13:24.555
Just picked it up from the tailor's.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.306
Fit's just right.

13:26.890 --> 13:27.850
So you're--

13:28.809 --> 13:30.018
So you're off to fight?

13:30.102 --> 13:31.645
Yes, I am.

13:31.728 --> 13:33.772
I got my draft card a couple days ago.

13:34.523 --> 13:37.067
I'm joining the Massachusetts 21st.

13:37.776 --> 13:39.486
That's the same regiment as Frazar.

13:39.570 --> 13:41.154
May he rest in peace.

13:41.822 --> 13:42.906
Buddy,

13:43.907 --> 13:45.617
I can't believe this.

13:45.701 --> 13:47.911
The Union need all the men they can get.

13:47.995 --> 13:52.332
Every man in Amherst is getting drafted.
Cards come every day.

13:52.416 --> 13:54.126
I'm surprised
you haven't gotten yours yet.

13:54.209 --> 13:57.212
Yes. Well, I'm sure mine will come soon.

13:58.172 --> 13:59.256
Any day now.

14:00.340 --> 14:03.010
George Gould, you're very brave.

14:03.093 --> 14:04.469
Just doing my duty.

14:06.054 --> 14:08.765
I've been called to fight,
and I will fight.

14:08.849 --> 14:10.392
Because I believe in a better country,

14:11.560 --> 14:12.978
same as John Brown,

14:13.896 --> 14:14.897
same as Frazar.

14:16.815 --> 14:18.317
There's something I have to tell you.

14:19.359 --> 14:22.154
-Both of you.
-Austin. What is it?

14:23.071 --> 14:28.035
I've done something that I don't think
either of you can ever forgive me for.

14:29.161 --> 14:30.579
What could be so bad?

14:32.831 --> 14:35.125
I paid someone to go to war in my place.

14:36.585 --> 14:40.380
My draft card came, and a few days later,

14:40.464 --> 14:44.510
I went off to a bar, got drunk,

14:44.593 --> 14:48.847
and I paid the Irish bartender
to go in my place.

14:51.308 --> 14:55.354
It was later that day that
we found out that Frazar had been killed.

14:56.396 --> 14:57.397
I just--

14:59.191 --> 15:00.776
I couldn't leave him.

15:00.859 --> 15:02.110
Leave who?

15:02.194 --> 15:04.655
The baby. Our son.

15:07.741 --> 15:09.952
I want to be a good father.

15:10.452 --> 15:12.371
I don't want to be
the kind of father I had.

15:12.454 --> 15:14.498
I don't wanna be that kind of man.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.124
I wanna be different.

15:16.208 --> 15:18.168
And I want our son to be different too.

15:19.336 --> 15:24.508
And if I go off and leave him
and never come back,

15:25.509 --> 15:26.844
how will I teach him?

15:28.053 --> 15:29.763
How will I make sure

15:29.847 --> 15:32.808
that the future of the Dickinsons
is different from the past?

15:34.643 --> 15:39.356
Now, there's gonna be a dead Irishman
off in a field somewhere,

15:39.439 --> 15:42.484
and I'll be right here.

15:43.151 --> 15:44.194
A traitor.

15:44.903 --> 15:45.946
And coward.

15:46.738 --> 15:47.990
Austin.

15:49.741 --> 15:50.868
I understand.

15:50.951 --> 15:53.704
You don't have to say that, George.

15:53.787 --> 15:55.038
But I mean it.

15:57.165 --> 15:58.625
You've done what you've done.

15:59.293 --> 16:03.172
And there's no going back on it now,
but that doesn't mean all is lost.

16:03.255 --> 16:05.048
You can still make up for it.

16:05.632 --> 16:08.677
There is work to be done
in all corners of society.

16:09.386 --> 16:11.972
You don't have to go to war to be a man.

16:12.639 --> 16:16.435
You might find ways to make
this country better by staying right here,

16:17.477 --> 16:18.604
at home…

16:20.063 --> 16:21.857
while you're looking after your family.

16:26.862 --> 16:28.614
We left it all on the floor.

16:28.697 --> 16:30.199
Yes, we did.

16:30.282 --> 16:32.242
Some people want it to happen.

16:32.951 --> 16:34.620
-Others wish it would happen.
-Yeah.

16:34.703 --> 16:37.122
-And some people make it happen.
-That's right!

16:37.206 --> 16:39.082
-We made it happen.
-Yes!

16:39.166 --> 16:42.753
We turned a negative situation
into a positive situation.

16:42.836 --> 16:44.880
-We play to win!
-Yeah!

16:44.963 --> 16:46.840
Greatness is an evolutionary process.

16:48.008 --> 16:49.551
-I believe I can fly.
-Go, Michael Jordan.

16:49.635 --> 16:51.845
I believe you can fly too, Michael Jordan.

16:51.929 --> 16:53.055
I do too.

16:53.138 --> 16:55.557
In fact, I just saw it happen.

16:55.641 --> 16:57.643
We flew over those Southern boys.

16:58.143 --> 17:02.356
They never even saw us coming.
They just heard the sounds of our wings.

17:02.439 --> 17:04.566
-Henry, that's beautiful.
-We were like birds.

17:04.650 --> 17:08.237
Hell yeah, man.
We moved together. We flew together.

17:08.319 --> 17:10.614
Battlefield Boys for life! You hear me?

17:10.696 --> 17:12.366
-Battlefield Boys.
-You hear me?

17:12.449 --> 17:14.576
-A murmuration.
-A murmur-what?

17:14.660 --> 17:15.827
A murmuration.

17:15.911 --> 17:19.665
That's what you call a flock of birds
that flies synchronistically.

17:20.290 --> 17:23.752
Starlings are the classic example,
but geese have been known to do it too.

17:23.836 --> 17:27.089
-Henry, have a drink.
-Hey! There you are!

17:27.172 --> 17:28.382
We ain't in class no more.

17:29.508 --> 17:31.385
Everybody! There you are!

17:32.010 --> 17:34.346
-Holy shit! That was epic.
-What the hell?

17:34.429 --> 17:35.973
-Look who's here.
-You all right there, Colonel?

17:36.056 --> 17:37.266
Yes, I'm just--

17:39.309 --> 17:41.353
It's been an emotional 24 hours.

17:43.814 --> 17:46.525
As soon as I realized what you'd done,
I feared you were all dead.

17:47.693 --> 17:50.070
No. We not dead. They dead.

17:52.406 --> 17:54.032
I'm sorry, sir,

17:54.741 --> 17:58.120
but in the end, we decided to go ahead
and create our own future.

17:58.203 --> 18:01.290
So I see. And what a victory you have won.

18:01.373 --> 18:03.208
It's incredible.

18:03.292 --> 18:05.502
Though I will say
you caused quite a stir back at the base.

18:05.586 --> 18:07.421
Saxton doesn't know what to do
other than yell at me.

18:07.504 --> 18:08.839
We never meant to cause you trouble.

18:08.922 --> 18:11.508
Please. You reminded me
how much I miss being a troublemaker.

18:12.467 --> 18:14.428
I'm a reformer, not a conformer.

18:15.429 --> 18:21.268
To be honest, I actually feel like--
like I lost my way a little bit,

18:21.351 --> 18:24.688
which is why
I'm going to be taking a sabbatical.

18:24.771 --> 18:25.689
A "sababa"?

18:26.398 --> 18:27.649
A sabbatical?

18:27.733 --> 18:30.861
Yes, I have much to ponder,
much to reflect on.

18:30.944 --> 18:34.114
And I'll be taking some time off
to do that.

18:34.198 --> 18:35.199
While I'm gone,

18:36.200 --> 18:37.451
you'll be in charge.

18:37.534 --> 18:39.203
I've decided to make you a sergeant.

18:39.286 --> 18:40.329
I'm sorry.

18:40.412 --> 18:43.874
-Me? In charge?
-Yes, you.

18:43.957 --> 18:46.043
You've more than proved yourself.
Don't you think, guys?

18:46.126 --> 18:47.794
-Hey!
-Who could be better?

18:48.545 --> 18:49.630
-Yeah.
-Henry.

18:49.713 --> 18:53.926
Henry, Henry, Henry, Henry, Henry, Henry!

18:54.009 --> 18:55.427
Go ahead, Alphabet!

18:55.511 --> 18:57.262
-Hey!
-It's settled.

19:02.476 --> 19:03.769
And where will you go?

19:03.852 --> 19:07.689
Home, Boston town. But first, Amherst.

19:07.773 --> 19:08.774
Amherst?

19:08.857 --> 19:13.111
Yes. There's someone there
that I just have to meet.

19:13.195 --> 19:15.030
A poet whose words have brought me

19:15.113 --> 19:17.199
so much comfort and clarity
during these bitter months.

19:17.282 --> 19:18.283
Her name's Emily Dickinson.

19:19.993 --> 19:22.162
Henry, what is it?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

19:22.246 --> 19:23.789
I know Emily Dickinson.

19:25.249 --> 19:27.835
-What?
-I used to work for her family.

19:27.918 --> 19:30.295
Wait.
You're telling me that this whole time,

19:30.379 --> 19:32.631
I've been with someone
who knows this person?

19:32.714 --> 19:34.675
Somebody who's actually been
in her presence?

19:34.758 --> 19:39.096
This genius who-- who captured emotions
that I didn't even know I possessed?

19:39.680 --> 19:41.598
Her lines still haunt me.

19:42.224 --> 19:43.475
Check this out.

19:44.184 --> 19:46.061
My Life had stood - a Loaded Gun -

19:46.144 --> 19:47.646
In Corners - till a Day

19:48.272 --> 19:50.566
The Owner passed - identified -

19:50.649 --> 19:51.817
And carried Me away -

19:51.900 --> 19:54.945
-Okay. God dang.
-Some white girl wrote that?

19:55.028 --> 19:56.071
She spittin'.

19:56.154 --> 19:57.948
Henry, honestly, you have to tell me.

19:58.031 --> 19:59.199
What is she like?

20:00.492 --> 20:04.454
You know, you should really
discover that for yourself.

20:05.205 --> 20:07.040
-You're absolutely right.
-Yeah.

20:07.124 --> 20:08.792
All the more reason
for me to leave at once.

20:09.835 --> 20:11.128
Higginson, wait.

20:11.211 --> 20:12.421
Yeah?

20:12.504 --> 20:14.089
If you're going to Amherst,

20:15.090 --> 20:17.217
there's something I need you to do for me.

20:22.806 --> 20:24.725
Well, would you look at that?

20:27.436 --> 20:28.604
Beautiful.

20:28.687 --> 20:29.688
Wow.

20:32.566 --> 20:35.152
I'll tell y'all,
now that I learned how to fly…

20:35.235 --> 20:38.113
Yeah? Go on, tell us.

20:39.531 --> 20:41.033
I'll never walk again.

21:05.390 --> 21:06.391
Emily.

21:06.475 --> 21:07.976
I came to see you.

21:09.144 --> 21:10.145
Come in.

21:11.063 --> 21:12.105
You have guests.

21:12.814 --> 21:16.818
Austin invited some people over
to say goodbye.

21:17.486 --> 21:18.820
Goodbye to who?

21:20.656 --> 21:23.116
George. He's going to war.

21:23.825 --> 21:25.494
Not George too.

21:31.124 --> 21:33.043
Well, I wanna say bye to him then,

21:34.127 --> 21:36.171
but I want some time alone
with you tonight.

21:37.005 --> 21:38.131
All right.

21:38.215 --> 21:42.636
Is there something specific
that you want to talk about or…

21:42.719 --> 21:43.720
There is,

21:44.346 --> 21:45.931
but it can't be said in words.

21:46.014 --> 21:48.308
Emily. Emily, the guests.

21:49.726 --> 21:51.228
The two of us.

21:51.854 --> 21:53.605
Okay? Tonight.

21:59.111 --> 22:02.614
"Come, let's have one other gaudy night.

22:02.698 --> 22:04.741
Call to me, all my sad captains.

22:04.825 --> 22:06.410
Fill our bowls once more.

22:06.952 --> 22:08.579
Let's mock the midnight bell."

22:08.662 --> 22:10.414
That's from Shakespeare Club.

22:11.957 --> 22:13.917
Let's party, my platonic friend.

22:57.336 --> 22:59.046
Watch me.

23:47.219 --> 23:48.220
Helen!

23:49.096 --> 23:50.472
Come on in, honey.

23:51.390 --> 23:52.516
Dinner's hot.

24:00.399 --> 24:02.276
What on earth?

24:02.359 --> 24:03.527
Betty.

24:04.194 --> 24:05.279
Good evening.

24:05.863 --> 24:07.990
Mr. Dickinson, what happened to you?

24:08.073 --> 24:09.908
You look like
you've been living underground.

24:09.992 --> 24:11.535
Well, I'm all right. I'm all right.

24:12.452 --> 24:15.706
I was thrown from a carriage
halfway to Boston.

24:15.789 --> 24:17.666
So I decided to walk home, but I'm fine.

24:17.749 --> 24:19.168
Your coat is in tatters.

24:19.251 --> 24:20.794
You must be starving.

24:20.878 --> 24:23.755
Would you-- Would you like a bowl of soup?

24:23.839 --> 24:25.591
No, no, no. You're too kind.

24:25.674 --> 24:27.718
It's meatball soup. Very hearty.

24:28.302 --> 24:29.678
Meatball soup?

24:29.761 --> 24:31.263
Why don't you come on in?

24:31.346 --> 24:33.724
There's plenty of food.
I'll mend your coat for you.

24:33.807 --> 24:36.226
You can't go home to Mrs. Dickinson
looking like that.

24:36.727 --> 24:39.104
Hi, Mama.
I was playing fairies in the woods.

24:39.646 --> 24:42.774
-She has quite the imagination, this one.
-That's just like my Emily.

24:42.858 --> 24:45.027
Mr. Dickinson's gonna come eat
some soup with us.

24:45.110 --> 24:47.154
-No, I--
-Now, you hush.

24:47.237 --> 24:49.281
I can't let a man go hungry.

24:49.364 --> 24:51.074
He can sit in Daddy's chair.

24:52.159 --> 24:53.493
She misses her father.

24:53.577 --> 24:55.120
Yes. Well, I'm sure he misses you.

24:56.371 --> 25:00.375
Being a father
is one of the greatest gifts in the world.

25:02.878 --> 25:04.338
So, yeah.

25:04.421 --> 25:07.674
I've been working
on a new performance piece about grief.

25:08.759 --> 25:11.637
We've all been processing so much grief,
you know?

25:12.262 --> 25:15.140
We've lost loved ones.
And we've lost more than that.

25:17.017 --> 25:18.560
We've lost an old world.

25:19.228 --> 25:21.063
We've lost the way things used to be.

25:22.397 --> 25:24.983
So, what's the new piece?

25:25.067 --> 25:26.318
Yeah, it sounds amazing.

25:26.401 --> 25:28.779
Well, it's site-specific.

25:28.862 --> 25:31.657
I do it in the barn with a dying sheep.

25:31.740 --> 25:32.950
Not Old Bessie?

25:33.033 --> 25:33.867
Yes.

25:34.618 --> 25:37.412
-No.
-I sit across from Old Bessie,

25:38.580 --> 25:42.084
and I stare into her eyes,
and I think about death.

25:42.960 --> 25:46.421
I picture the sheep slowly dying,

25:47.381 --> 25:50.217
her body slowly decomposing,

25:50.926 --> 25:52.970
her eyeballs popping out of their sockets

25:53.053 --> 25:55.597
just as Joseph's eyeballs
must have popped out,

25:56.139 --> 25:57.391
one by one.

25:57.474 --> 25:59.476
Pop! Pop.

26:00.727 --> 26:05.315
I meditate on the basic reality
that one day we will all be dust.

26:07.442 --> 26:08.944
It's called Sheep No More.

26:09.653 --> 26:12.239
It's dedicated to the memory
of all my dead ex-boyfriends.

26:12.823 --> 26:14.867
Wish I was sticking around
long enough to see that.

26:16.159 --> 26:17.494
There is no audience.

26:17.578 --> 26:18.871
I do love sheep.

26:19.538 --> 26:22.499
These years of war have really
changed all of us, haven't they?

26:22.583 --> 26:26.420
Yeah. Sometimes I feel like
we've inherited a totally different world

26:26.503 --> 26:27.713
from the one our parents knew.

26:27.796 --> 26:29.173
Maybe that's a good thing.

26:29.256 --> 26:30.757
The world is messed up, but…

26:32.176 --> 26:34.928
I think we can all find ways
to make it better,

26:35.012 --> 26:36.597
even if just a little bit.

26:36.680 --> 26:38.348
I wanna believe that, George.

26:39.016 --> 26:42.436
And I don't know what my way is yet,
but I'm gonna find it.

26:42.519 --> 26:44.688
And whenever you come back home, I--

26:44.771 --> 26:47.149
You'll be proud of what I've done.

26:47.232 --> 26:50.819
Well, then, I hope I come back.

26:52.529 --> 26:54.364
The way Hope builds his House

26:55.532 --> 26:57.367
It is not with a sill -

26:57.451 --> 26:59.995
Nor Rafter - has that Edifice

27:00.078 --> 27:01.371
But only Pinnacle -

27:02.122 --> 27:03.707
Look on the bright side, George.

27:03.790 --> 27:08.086
Now that you've enlisted,
you'll receive a free copy of Drumbeat,

27:08.170 --> 27:11.006
the Union Army newsletter
my husband and I publish

27:11.089 --> 27:13.800
with the help of Abraham Lincoln himself.

27:13.884 --> 27:14.885
The President.

27:14.968 --> 27:19.348
Here. I happen to have
a spare copy right here.

27:19.431 --> 27:21.892
And Emily has a poem in this one.

27:22.976 --> 27:24.019
A poem?

27:24.102 --> 27:27.189
Oops, I mean, anonymous does.

27:28.190 --> 27:29.525
I don't understand.

27:29.608 --> 27:33.529
Emily, I gave them one of your poems.

27:34.196 --> 27:36.448
You… did?

27:36.532 --> 27:39.785
I said it had to be anonymous.
I knew that you'd want it that way.

27:40.744 --> 27:44.289
But your work is so powerful.

27:44.373 --> 27:47.251
And I just felt
like the country needed it.

27:50.712 --> 27:52.172
Will you forgive me?

27:54.925 --> 27:58.720
Hey, you should read it to us.

27:59.471 --> 28:00.681
That would be huge.

28:00.764 --> 28:04.101
-Yes. A poem by Emily.
-She won't do it.

28:04.184 --> 28:07.145
-She never reads aloud.
-Emily, do it. Just this once.

28:07.229 --> 28:08.564
Would you, Em?

28:08.647 --> 28:10.440
It'd be the greatest goodbye gift for me,

28:11.066 --> 28:12.901
to have your voice in my head while I'm…

28:13.902 --> 28:14.903
out there.

28:18.949 --> 28:19.950
I'll do it.

28:21.368 --> 28:22.661
I'll do it for all of you.

28:26.707 --> 28:28.083
But mostly for Sue.

28:35.799 --> 28:38.010
These are the days when Birds come back -

28:41.221 --> 28:42.347
a very few -

28:43.390 --> 28:45.184
a Bird or two -

28:46.351 --> 28:48.020
To take a backward look.

28:51.064 --> 28:52.733
These are the days

28:53.358 --> 28:54.610
when skies resume

28:55.569 --> 28:57.613
The old - old sophistries of June -

28:59.448 --> 29:01.825
A blue and gold mistake.

29:03.368 --> 29:06.038
Oh fraud that cannot cheat the Bee.

29:06.121 --> 29:07.831
almost thy plausibility

29:07.915 --> 29:09.875
Induces my belief.

29:10.876 --> 29:13.545
Till ranks of seeds their witness bear -

29:14.505 --> 29:17.883
and softly thro' the altered air

29:17.966 --> 29:20.219
Hurries a timid leaf.

29:24.389 --> 29:26.517
Oh Sacrament of summer days,

29:26.600 --> 29:29.102
Oh Last Communion in the Haze - Permit

29:29.186 --> 29:30.812
a child to join -

29:36.944 --> 29:38.987
Thy sacred emblems to partake -

29:40.781 --> 29:42.824
Thy consecrated bread to take

29:46.078 --> 29:48.038
and thine immortal wine!

29:54.086 --> 29:56.255
Thank you for publishing my poem.

29:57.840 --> 29:59.383
Thank you for writing it.

30:04.221 --> 30:06.056
You know, this…

30:07.724 --> 30:09.017
this right here…

30:11.019 --> 30:13.021
this is better than any poem.

30:36.211 --> 30:37.963
All the letters I can write

30:41.425 --> 30:43.468
Are not fair as this -

30:49.600 --> 30:51.518
Syllables of Velvet -

30:57.441 --> 30:59.693
Sentences of Plush,

31:32.601 --> 31:35.562
depths of Ruby, undrained,

31:37.231 --> 31:39.816
Hid, Lip, for Thee -

31:42.069 --> 31:44.321
Play it were a Humming Bird -

31:46.532 --> 31:49.159
And just sipped - me -
