WEBVTT

00:08.842 --> 00:10.051
[Justine] <i>It's a million degrees in here.</i>

00:10.135 --> 00:11.553
-[Sam] <i>It's not that bad.</i>
-[Justine] <i>Yes, it is.</i>

00:11.928 --> 00:14.139
-You’re sweating. Like, a lot.
-Huh?

00:14.889 --> 00:17.308
Well, yeah,
the fucking air conditioner's broken.

00:17.392 --> 00:18.768
-[presses buttons]
-Well, maybe roll down

00:18.852 --> 00:20.061
all the windows, then.<i> </i>

00:20.145 --> 00:22.439
[sighs]
All right, listen, when we go in there,

00:22.522 --> 00:24.190
don’t make too much small talk.

00:24.399 --> 00:26.192
-I’m not gonna say anything.
-Well, no.

00:26.276 --> 00:28.737
I mean, [stammers]
you gotta say something, but...

00:28.903 --> 00:30.321
J-Just be yourself.

00:30.905 --> 00:33.199
You know, maybe ten percent less weird.
That would be good.

00:33.491 --> 00:34.909
Wow. Okay, thanks.

00:34.993 --> 00:37.287
You know what I'm saying.
I mean, it's just...

00:37.787 --> 00:40.081
I--
I need you to look like you give a shit.

00:40.582 --> 00:42.083
I give a shit.

00:42.167 --> 00:44.919
It’s summer vacation,
and I’m not backpacking through Europe.

00:45.003 --> 00:46.004
I’m here.

00:46.838 --> 00:47.881
I really want this.

00:48.173 --> 00:50.925
All right, okay.
All right. But don't want it too much.

00:51.009 --> 00:53.720
You know what I mean? Don't...
You don't wanna appear desperate.

00:57.474 --> 01:00.268
Christ, I haven't been here
in a long time.

01:01.811 --> 01:02.645
Hey.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.440
Uh, Sam Sylvia, Justine Biagi.

01:05.774 --> 01:09.235
[guard] Yes, sir. Please pull forward
and park in any of the visitors spaces.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.071
[Sam] Okay, here we go.

01:11.154 --> 01:14.407
Happy fucking faces. Happy faces.

01:14.949 --> 01:17.994
Not too happy. Not... Okay.

01:18.078 --> 01:22.373
[uplifting rock music playing]

01:22.707 --> 01:25.794
Ah. How about this one?
Reserved, but still fun.

01:25.877 --> 01:27.337
No! [grunts]

01:27.420 --> 01:29.631
-What's wrong with pigs?
-She hates animals.

01:29.714 --> 01:31.049
So, no leopard print, then?

01:31.132 --> 01:32.550
-Where--
-[knocking at door]

01:32.675 --> 01:34.761
[takes a deep breath] Fuck.

01:37.514 --> 01:39.057
Hi, Birdie. [clears throat]

01:39.682 --> 01:41.976
There is a water feature in the kitchen.

01:43.686 --> 01:47.065
It’s a hot tub. [chuckles]
They’re standard in all the penthouses.

01:47.440 --> 01:48.483
Please, come in.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.944
Careful making toast.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.947
Well, we mostly order room service.
It's free.

01:54.572 --> 01:55.907
-Mostly.
-[door closes]

01:56.658 --> 01:58.618
[Bash, in hoarse voice]
Where are you staying?

01:58.868 --> 02:01.913
At the Sands.
What’s the matter with your voice?

02:02.163 --> 02:03.790
Oh, Bash is on vocal rest.

02:03.873 --> 02:07.585
He basically yells for an hour straight
every night, and the audience loves him.

02:07.669 --> 02:10.130
-But it’s very hard on his vocal chords.
-[quietly] Very hard.

02:10.296 --> 02:13.883
Oh. So you speak <i>for </i>him.

02:14.843 --> 02:16.553
Oh! Rhonda. [chuckles]

02:17.470 --> 02:19.097
Rhonda Howard.

02:20.849 --> 02:23.643
-I'm sorry I didn’t say anything sooner.
-No, I'm fine.

02:23.726 --> 02:26.187
I mean, what mother doesn’t want to learn
from American Express

02:26.271 --> 02:28.022
that her son has married a new cardholder?

02:28.439 --> 02:30.066
And there's why
I didn't say anything sooner.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.776
[Birdie] Oh, save your voice, Romeo.

02:31.860 --> 02:36.030
I’m simply here to meet the woman
that my son fell so madly in love with

02:36.114 --> 02:39.075
that he kept her a secret from his family.

02:39.325 --> 02:40.994
Well, maybe this is a good thing.

02:41.369 --> 02:44.706
Because I don't like secrets.
And I've been wanting to meet you, too,

02:44.789 --> 02:45.999
-Mom.
-No, no.

02:46.207 --> 02:47.625
-Mrs. Howard.
-[Bash] Uh-uh.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.419
-[whispers] Birdie.
-Birdie.

02:50.587 --> 02:53.715
[takes a deep breath] Let's order lunch.

02:54.716 --> 02:55.967
And drinks.

02:57.010 --> 03:00.096
[woman]
So... I'm just gonna come out and say it.

03:01.181 --> 03:04.350
We are very interested in this.

03:04.809 --> 03:07.145
I do have a couple of thoughts,
mostly questions.

03:07.228 --> 03:09.647
-Uh, uh, yeah. Of course, go ahead. Shoot.
-[bag unzips]

03:09.731 --> 03:11.774
-[clears throat]
-[woman] So, my first question...

03:12.150 --> 03:13.985
what do you think of Michael J. Fox?

03:14.152 --> 03:15.069
Uh...

03:15.153 --> 03:16.321
He's great. Yeah.

03:16.404 --> 03:17.864
For what? For-- For the dad?

03:18.239 --> 03:19.282
He’s a little young.

03:19.574 --> 03:20.783
No, I mean for Jules.

03:21.492 --> 03:23.536
But, uh, Jules is a girl.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.663
[woman] Well, in this draft, sure,
but, you know,

03:25.747 --> 03:28.041
I've worked with Michael,
and he is one of the nicest,

03:28.124 --> 03:29.751
most down-to-earth people.

03:29.834 --> 03:31.461
And he's mid-20s, but he plays young.

03:32.295 --> 03:33.129
Okay.

03:35.465 --> 03:39.135
Uh, my next question:
The title... are we married to it?

03:40.929 --> 03:44.098
[Debbie] Want me to throw it back?
Yeah! I'll throw it back.

03:44.182 --> 03:45.850
-I'll throw it. Throw it.
-[blows raspberry]

03:45.934 --> 03:48.603
Oh, thank you. That was mean.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.521
-[door opens]
-[chuckles]

03:51.564 --> 03:52.398
-Oh, hi.
-Hey.

03:52.482 --> 03:54.484
I’ve got, um, paychecks.

03:54.567 --> 03:57.820
-[Randy giggling and babbling]
-Oh!

03:57.904 --> 04:00.657
-[Debbie] Oh, my God. Okay. I gotta...
-Can I talk to you?

04:00.907 --> 04:02.200
Yes. Uh...

04:02.283 --> 04:06.496
Okay, we're gonna have to do it out here
because I-- I now live in the hallway.

04:06.579 --> 04:07.830
That's all Randy wants to do.

04:07.914 --> 04:10.750
An entire fucking hotel playhouse,
and we’re just in the hallway.

04:10.833 --> 04:12.835
So, have a seat. Welcome to my office.

04:13.419 --> 04:14.545
What can I do for you?

04:14.629 --> 04:16.297
-[Jenny] Thank you.
-Here's your paycheck.

04:16.464 --> 04:17.423
[Jenny] Um...

04:17.507 --> 04:18.466
Okay.

04:18.549 --> 04:21.803
I have been reviewing my finances

04:21.886 --> 04:24.055
and speaking to, uh,

04:24.138 --> 04:26.140
other costume designers
on the Strip,

04:26.224 --> 04:29.686
who were surprised to find out
that I am not being compensated

04:29.769 --> 04:31.396
for my additional wardrobe work.

04:31.479 --> 04:34.983
You-- What? We don’t pay you
for your additional wardrobe work?

04:35.275 --> 04:38.903
You do not.
And I know I’m not Bob Mackie, or...

04:39.237 --> 04:41.572
Pete Menefee, or Michael Travis,

04:41.656 --> 04:45.076
but all of the costumes
require maintenance

04:45.159 --> 04:46.244
and doubles,

04:46.327 --> 04:49.872
and my goal is to leave here
with as much money as possible

04:49.956 --> 04:52.083
without spending one more cent
at this hotel,

04:52.166 --> 04:53.584
because it offends me to my core.

04:53.668 --> 04:55.670
[Randy cooing]

04:55.962 --> 05:01.092
So, uh, how much of a weekly increase
would that be... exactly?

05:01.968 --> 05:04.095
I believe a...

05:04.887 --> 05:07.432
13 percent jump would be reasonable,

05:07.515 --> 05:08.766
given my research.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.768
And I will accept nothing less,

05:10.852 --> 05:13.563
or will cease my responsibilities
henceforth immediately.

05:14.397 --> 05:15.231
Okay.

05:16.065 --> 05:17.025
Um...

05:17.483 --> 05:19.610
I will see what I can do.
Thank you, Jenny.

05:19.694 --> 05:21.779
-I'm glad you came to me.
-[Jenny] You are?

05:22.322 --> 05:23.156
[Debbie] Yeah.

05:23.406 --> 05:24.741
[sighs]

05:25.366 --> 05:28.119
-I was pretty nervous.
-You did so well, I couldn't tell at all.

05:28.202 --> 05:29.203
-Really?
-[Debbie] Yeah.

05:29.287 --> 05:30.538
-Wow, great.
-[gasps]

05:31.372 --> 05:33.249
Where the fuck is Randy? Randy?

05:33.583 --> 05:34.417
Randy?

05:34.500 --> 05:35.835
-[Dawn] We got him!
-[Randy laughs]

05:35.918 --> 05:39.464
Oh, you love Dawn and Stacey, don't you?

05:39.547 --> 05:40.882
[Stacey] Yes, you did so good...

05:41.424 --> 05:42.633
-Oh!
-Hi!

05:42.717 --> 05:44.635
[Stacey] I know you stopped breastfeeding
a while ago,

05:44.719 --> 05:46.637
but this kid's still got a thing for tits.

05:46.721 --> 05:49.766
-What can I say? He's a Vegas baby now.
-[Dawn and Stacey laugh]

05:50.183 --> 05:52.769
I mean, we've broken up before, but...

05:53.144 --> 05:54.854
I think it's for real this time.

05:55.271 --> 05:57.607
I can't eat anything. I can't sleep.

05:57.899 --> 06:00.818
-I start crying at the weirdest times.
-[croupier] Place your bet.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.112
I don't have anyone to talk to about it.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.656
Because the person I want to talk to
about it is Yolanda,

06:05.740 --> 06:08.284
and I can't talk to her about it,
you know?

06:08.368 --> 06:09.869
-[croupier] No more bets.
-No, not really.

06:11.245 --> 06:12.372
[croupier] Hard six.

06:12.538 --> 06:13.623
Six. You win.

06:14.374 --> 06:15.958
But you and Keith...

06:16.125 --> 06:17.251
We’re still married.

06:17.585 --> 06:20.129
He’s in LA, working.
I’m in Vegas, working. The end.

06:21.297 --> 06:22.590
Press on my five and ten?

06:23.674 --> 06:25.885
-Place your bets.
-Oh, I'm out.

06:26.344 --> 06:27.220
Where you going?

06:27.804 --> 06:30.890
I made a deal with myself I would
only spend $20 of my paycheck.

06:30.973 --> 06:32.850
[sighs] I'm gonna go eat.

06:33.518 --> 06:34.435
Alone.

06:36.270 --> 06:37.438
[scoffs]

06:38.981 --> 06:40.274
People have to eat.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.111
You know, I hate eating alone.

06:43.194 --> 06:44.904
You know, people say bring a book.

06:45.279 --> 06:47.407
Sit at the bar. I can't do it.

06:47.949 --> 06:50.243
Right now, I just wanna be alone
with a bunch of people.

06:50.326 --> 06:51.577
That's why I like craps.

06:51.661 --> 06:53.538
That’s why a lot of people like craps.

06:53.788 --> 06:54.956
-You ever play?
-Oh, no.

06:55.039 --> 06:57.208
I can't gamble here,
it's against the rules.

06:57.583 --> 07:00.461
And I'm a little bit of a scaredy-cat
when it comes to taking risks, so...

07:00.837 --> 07:04.924
[sighs] Well, I got four letters
from my husband I'm too scared to open.

07:05.341 --> 07:06.926
We're all afraid of something, Rita.

07:08.970 --> 07:10.555
[Birdie] So, Rhonda...

07:11.222 --> 07:12.932
you're from England.

07:13.516 --> 07:14.559
What gave it away?

07:14.642 --> 07:18.146
-[Rhonda and Bash chuckle]
-[Birdie laughs exaggeratedly]

07:19.355 --> 07:20.356
London?

07:20.982 --> 07:23.234
-Bromley.
-Suburbs.

07:24.068 --> 07:25.736
Aren’t the suburbs in England,

07:25.820 --> 07:28.448
how do you say it...
[in English accent] a bit dodgy?

07:28.656 --> 07:30.074
[laughs]

07:30.408 --> 07:32.452
They are. That's why I left.

07:32.952 --> 07:35.955
And how long have you been
in <i>our </i>fine country?

07:36.038 --> 07:36.873
Um...

07:37.623 --> 07:38.541
Three years.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.294
-Do you know the band Duran Duran?
-Very popular.

07:42.003 --> 07:43.171
[Rhonda] They were touring the States,

07:43.254 --> 07:45.798
and they asked me and my mate
if we wanted to come, and we were like,

07:45.882 --> 07:47.258
"Uh, yeah." [chuckles]

07:47.425 --> 07:48.259
Flew private.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.219
See, I wanna be a singer,

07:50.303 --> 07:52.930
and I knew if I stayed in the UK,
I’d never be discovered.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.933
So, when the tour came to LA,
I decided to stay.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.644
It was really hard at first.
But I stuck it out.

07:59.353 --> 08:02.732
And I’m so glad I did because, otherwise,
I never would’ve been desperate enough

08:02.815 --> 08:05.818
to try out for <i>GLOW</i>
and meet this brilliant man.

08:06.235 --> 08:07.570
-[chuckles]
-Oh!

08:07.653 --> 08:09.947
Okay, so you're on the show.

08:10.406 --> 08:13.534
See, here I was thinking that
the two of you met...

08:14.452 --> 08:17.330
-what, in an alley somewhere?
-[all laugh]

08:17.413 --> 08:19.248
-Well, I did live in my car.
-[Birdie] Did you?

08:19.332 --> 08:20.416
Let's not...

08:21.584 --> 08:22.919
[coughs] Are you leaving?

08:23.628 --> 08:24.837
No, I'm not leaving.

08:25.505 --> 08:29.217
I was thinking that we...
should go shopping.

08:31.219 --> 08:32.053
We should?

08:32.136 --> 08:33.888
[Birdie] We should!
You're married to my son,

08:33.971 --> 08:37.266
and I haven't even gotten you
a wedding present.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.352
-Well, I'll come.
-[Birdie] Nonsense.

08:40.061 --> 08:42.063
Oh, don't worry, I won't bite.

08:42.647 --> 08:46.943
I just wanna get to know
my daughter-in-law, one-on-one.

08:47.276 --> 08:48.778
Just us girls.

08:51.447 --> 08:54.200
I mean, it wouldn’t be the worst thing
in the world if Jules was a boy.

08:54.283 --> 08:55.743
In a David Bowie kind of way.

08:55.826 --> 08:57.328
It's a terrible idea.

08:57.411 --> 08:59.664
-You said it was interesting.
-Yeah, by “interesting,”

08:59.747 --> 09:00.915
I meant fucking stupid.

09:00.998 --> 09:04.001
I was just being polite
because she's a woman, you know?

09:04.085 --> 09:07.088
I mean, she had every other page
of your script crossed out.

09:07.296 --> 09:10.007
You know, you don't have to have a penis
to be a fucking asshole.

09:12.093 --> 09:14.053
Oh, that's another thing.
When they're giving their stupid notes,

09:14.136 --> 09:16.889
don’t take out your little notebook.
It's just gonna get you more notes.

09:18.432 --> 09:21.394
Okay. Well...
what's the deal with this guy?

09:21.477 --> 09:23.563
Don Silverberg. We go way back.

09:23.646 --> 09:25.106
I gave him his first job.

09:25.940 --> 09:29.694
So, hopefully, there's a little juice here
for me, and this will go a lot better.

09:32.446 --> 09:33.698
Sam Sylvia.

09:34.657 --> 09:37.118
-I kept you waiting.
-All right, all right!

09:37.618 --> 09:39.662
Don! How are ya?

09:41.789 --> 09:43.666
Okay. What,
are you a fucking Buddhist now?

09:43.833 --> 09:44.667
I am.

09:45.459 --> 09:46.419
All right.

09:46.502 --> 09:47.920
You... You know what?

09:48.004 --> 09:49.964
-You remember the last time I saw you?
-Mm.

09:50.047 --> 09:52.592
-I was drunk. It was at that pool party.
-[Don] Mm-hmm.

09:52.675 --> 09:55.344
And Bryan and his guys
were making you shave their asses

09:55.428 --> 09:56.304
because they thought

09:56.387 --> 09:57.805
-it would make 'em swim faster.
-[Don] Ah.

09:57.888 --> 09:59.348
[Don and Sam chuckle]

09:59.432 --> 10:01.642
Yeah, that isn't the last time
I saw you, Sam, but...

10:01.726 --> 10:03.978
I am not surprised
you don't remember that.

10:05.146 --> 10:08.024
All right, so let’s, uh,
let's skip the pleasantries, all right?

10:08.107 --> 10:11.569
My kid wrote a great script. I know that,
you know that. That's why we're here.

10:11.819 --> 10:12.737
I didn't read it.

10:14.071 --> 10:16.365
Okay, well,
we can walk you through the story.

10:16.449 --> 10:19.327
No, no, no, no, no. No, I just want
to know if the rumors are true.

10:20.494 --> 10:22.204
You're... directing porn now?

10:23.080 --> 10:24.165
No, it's not porn.

10:24.248 --> 10:28.085
It's women's wrestling, but, hey, as long
as people are still talking, right?

10:28.169 --> 10:29.128
They're not.

10:29.503 --> 10:31.088
No one gives a shit about you.

10:32.423 --> 10:33.883
But I remember you, Sam.

10:33.966 --> 10:35.885
How could I forget the guy

10:35.968 --> 10:38.429
who sent me to deliver flowers
to his mother's hospital room

10:38.512 --> 10:40.890
while he fucked an extra in his trailer?

10:40.973 --> 10:43.059
-You know, that--
-[Don] Or the time you made me cry

10:43.142 --> 10:46.228
in front of all those grips
'cause I didn't know what a hoagie was.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.731
[sniffles] They call 'em
submarine sandwiches where I'm from.

10:49.190 --> 10:50.816
[chuckles] Oh! Oh, yeah.

10:51.484 --> 10:52.902
I owe this guy everything.

10:53.944 --> 10:55.321
All right. Let's go.

10:55.404 --> 10:58.908
You know, I would've enjoyed this
a lot more if your daughter wasn't here.

10:58.991 --> 11:00.951
-I'm not a monster.
-You know, go fuck yourself,

11:01.035 --> 11:03.037
you fucking hypocrite Buddhist.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.414
-Feel better?
-I do, yeah. I mean...

11:05.581 --> 11:08.042
-Your last movie sucked.
-[Don] Oh, you mean <i>Out of Africa?</i>

11:08.459 --> 11:11.379
Yeah. Thanks.
I’ll be sure to let Sydney know!

11:12.129 --> 11:14.757
[sighs] Goddammit.

11:15.758 --> 11:18.177
Where the fuck is parking lot D? God...

11:18.386 --> 11:20.429
We’re gonna be late
for our next fucking meeting.

11:20.513 --> 11:23.224
Who cares? This sucks. Let’s just go home.

11:23.599 --> 11:24.975
Are you fucking kidding me?

11:25.142 --> 11:27.770
Do you know how much shit I had to eat
to get us these meetings?

11:27.853 --> 11:30.981
I had to call my ex-wife's brother
just to get a fucking phone number.

11:31.065 --> 11:33.442
I called my old agent,
who is twice as much,

11:33.526 --> 11:37.655
ten times as much of an asshole
as the Count of Monte Fuckface up there.

11:37.905 --> 11:38.948
I mean, come on!

11:39.031 --> 11:42.076
If I wanted to feel shitty and useless,
I could've stayed in Vegas.

11:42.743 --> 11:44.745
I didn’t ask you to do any of that.

11:44.829 --> 11:46.080
That’s not the point.

11:47.331 --> 11:50.459
Why can't we just grab a camera
and shoot the whole thing guerrilla-style,

11:50.543 --> 11:51.669
like you did for <i>Blood Disco?</i>

11:51.752 --> 11:55.381
Because you wrote something that's so much
fucking better than<i> Blood Disco,</i> it's...

11:55.464 --> 11:58.592
better than anything I've made,
or I'm gonna make, or fucking...

11:59.552 --> 12:01.303
Where the fuck is this parking lot?

12:01.554 --> 12:02.638
This is dumb.

12:02.972 --> 12:05.474
Ugh, fucking ungrateful. Seriously.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.393
Jesus Christ. Calm down.

12:07.601 --> 12:10.646
Look,
if you wanna fuck this up, be my guest,

12:10.730 --> 12:13.190
but don't come crying to me
if it turns out you squandered

12:13.274 --> 12:15.860
your one opportunity to be great.

12:16.944 --> 12:18.070
Or-- Or just, you know...

12:18.904 --> 12:20.156
not mediocre.

12:25.202 --> 12:26.495
Parking lot D.

12:29.457 --> 12:31.667
Yeah, I-- I-- I knew that's where it was.

12:36.088 --> 12:37.840
This one's kinda unique. [chuckles]

12:38.924 --> 12:42.303
Oh, look at these. [gasps]

12:44.138 --> 12:46.140
Which one do you like?

12:46.724 --> 12:48.517
I mean, if you had to pick one, which...

12:51.896 --> 12:52.897
Well...

12:54.523 --> 12:57.568
this one's Oscar de la Renta,
and very expensive.

12:58.277 --> 13:02.364
And this one's equally lovely
and cheaper.

13:03.407 --> 13:06.035
I think I'm supposed to choose
the more expensive one

13:06.118 --> 13:08.078
because it's more posh, but...

13:08.954 --> 13:11.707
I'm gonna go with this one
because I actually like it more.

13:15.586 --> 13:17.004
Interesting.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.594
[dress unzipping]

13:25.930 --> 13:26.764
[Rhonda sighs]

13:29.058 --> 13:29.934
Look...

13:30.434 --> 13:33.145
Bash told me to be scared of you,
and I am...

13:33.979 --> 13:36.524
but I also want to be honest with you.

13:39.610 --> 13:41.362
I married Bash for the wrong reasons.

13:41.529 --> 13:42.738
[sighs in exasperation]

13:42.822 --> 13:46.116
God, you're taking all the fun
out of this whole thing.

13:46.617 --> 13:50.246
Although I do appreciate you
not wasting my time.

13:51.163 --> 13:52.623
Okay, let's hear it.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.668
Okay, so...

13:56.335 --> 13:59.129
when Bash asked me to marry him,
I didn't love him.

14:00.214 --> 14:02.216
I didn't really even know him.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.052
I married Bash because...

14:07.596 --> 14:08.806
I needed a green card.

14:08.889 --> 14:12.935
You married my son
because you needed... a green card?

14:13.143 --> 14:16.689
[sighs] I know. I know it's awful,
but I love him now.

14:16.897 --> 14:18.065
I fell in love with him.

14:18.148 --> 14:21.861
Right, well, it's not hard
to fall in love with a millionaire.

14:23.445 --> 14:24.488
Maybe not.

14:24.947 --> 14:28.367
But... Bash is kind, and caring,

14:28.993 --> 14:31.161
and genuinely clever.

14:32.121 --> 14:36.000
[sighs] But he's also compulsive
and so innocent sometimes,

14:36.083 --> 14:37.793
it hurts to look at him, you know?

14:38.335 --> 14:41.547
And I see all these people
just wanting to take advantage of him

14:41.630 --> 14:44.592
and his generosity because all they see
is his money. And I--

14:44.675 --> 14:47.553
And I'm supposed to believe
that <i>you </i>don't.

14:49.054 --> 14:52.099
That you're not just gonna walk away
with all his money.

14:52.892 --> 14:53.893
[exhales]

14:54.852 --> 14:55.811
The other day...

14:56.228 --> 14:59.440
I saw all these unopened checks
just laying around the penthouse.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.817
And I asked Bash
why he didn’t deposit them,

15:01.901 --> 15:03.569
and he said he didn’t know how.

15:04.820 --> 15:08.240
So I went down to the Clark County
Credit Union, and I did it for him.

15:08.324 --> 15:12.286
And I put his paychecks into savings
so he can’t spend it.

15:13.370 --> 15:15.289
I’m not even sure he knew he got paid.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.668
[scoffs] So...

15:20.586 --> 15:23.130
you don't trust my son...

15:24.173 --> 15:27.134
-with money.
-Well, he's not good with it.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.680
But... no one has to be good
at everything.

15:38.062 --> 15:40.105
Oh, he didn't even get you a diamond.

15:40.439 --> 15:43.275
Oh, no, I picked that. I like blue.

15:43.567 --> 15:44.735
Well, I hate it.

15:46.862 --> 15:47.821
[laughs]

15:47.905 --> 15:49.198
[wails]

15:49.281 --> 15:51.283
[Debbie] Okay. I know. I know.

15:51.367 --> 15:53.953
I'm sorry. Sorry. Honey. I know, sweetie.

15:54.036 --> 15:56.538
You okay? I guess you have two of them.
Um...

15:56.622 --> 15:58.374
He's better in the hallway.

15:59.291 --> 16:00.209
Hey, bud.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.337
Hey, bud, look! It's okay.

16:03.420 --> 16:04.380
[footsteps fading]

16:04.463 --> 16:07.383
Um, I also have a check for Sam.

16:07.466 --> 16:12.179
Uh, is it my job now to send him the money
he somehow still collects

16:12.262 --> 16:13.847
while I'm here working?

16:16.392 --> 16:17.226
Great.

16:17.309 --> 16:19.770
Um, also, uh, Jenny came to me today

16:19.853 --> 16:22.856
with what I think is
a very reasonable request for a raise.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.900
Um, I went through the budget
that you and Sam made,

16:24.984 --> 16:27.987
and I found the money in what appears
to be a line item

16:28.070 --> 16:30.531
for cigarettes and Dr. Pepper.

16:32.658 --> 16:33.784
[scoffs]

16:36.078 --> 16:37.121
What's happening?

16:45.546 --> 16:49.049
"Fine with Jenny raise.
Not wasting my voice on this."

16:51.719 --> 16:52.803
Do you have a sore throat?

16:54.054 --> 16:57.474
I'm sorr-- Please, rest your voice.
That's so smart. In fact, you know what?

16:57.558 --> 17:00.185
You don't have to talk at all.
I'll just... What I wanna say is this:

17:00.269 --> 17:03.147
Um, you are a dickhead,
and I don't trust you anymore.

17:03.230 --> 17:04.565
And Sam may have run off to LA,

17:04.648 --> 17:06.692
but I am still here.
And I brought my fucking kid.

17:06.775 --> 17:09.528
So there's not a single day
I will not be in your face.

17:09.611 --> 17:13.574
[loudly]
And I have very strong vocal chords!

17:14.408 --> 17:15.242
[exhales]

17:20.622 --> 17:22.624
I wish more men would go on vocal rest.

17:24.001 --> 17:25.252
Randy, it's time to go!

17:29.631 --> 17:30.591
Oh, my God.

17:31.091 --> 17:34.178
[up-tempo electronic music playing]

17:37.598 --> 17:39.600
[Randy blows raspberry]

17:56.450 --> 17:57.951
[grunts] Oh, hey there.

17:58.202 --> 17:59.244
Ooh!

17:59.495 --> 18:01.872
Hey, big spender. You with somebody?
You looking to get lucky

18:01.955 --> 18:03.999
-like the rest of us? Okay.
-[man] Sir.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.959
You can’t have a baby on the casino floor.

18:06.043 --> 18:07.336
That's why I picked him up.

18:07.419 --> 18:10.214
-Oh, I got you, sweetheart. Okay, buddy.
-[Randy wails]

18:11.465 --> 18:14.426
-Oh, my God! There he is! I'm so sorry.
-[man 2] It's okay.

18:14.510 --> 18:17.846
So sorry! Oh, my God.
He just got on the elevator.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.474
I was right there and then, boom,
the doors just closed.

18:21.183 --> 18:24.436
Hey, I know you.
You were on my 11:40 flight.

18:25.395 --> 18:27.106
Oh, yeah. Didn't you have a beard?

18:27.439 --> 18:30.234
-Uh, yeah. Turned in my hobo card.
-[both chuckle]

18:30.317 --> 18:33.320
I vaguely remember losing my cool
in front of you.

18:33.612 --> 18:36.740
-Unlike, say, now.
-You know, I haven't seen you in a while.

18:37.741 --> 18:41.203
Yeah, well, I... Because I made
the very smart decision to, um...

18:41.578 --> 18:44.081
bring my baby to the casino where I work.

18:44.164 --> 18:47.251
And, as you can see,
it's going exactly according to plan.

18:47.334 --> 18:48.544
[both laugh]

18:48.627 --> 18:50.587
-Thank you for finding him.
-You're welcome.

18:50.671 --> 18:53.757
Um, can I buy you a,
uh, "thank you" drink?

18:54.842 --> 18:57.845
How about I buy you
a "you're welcome" dinner instead?

18:58.679 --> 19:01.014
Are you asking me on a date while I...
[chuckles]

19:01.098 --> 19:03.350
...am holding my screaming son
in a casino?

19:03.433 --> 19:05.811
Yeah. You got a good babysitter?

19:05.894 --> 19:06.728
Um...

19:07.563 --> 19:09.773
Yeah. I’ve got some options.

19:10.023 --> 19:11.900
All right, I'll pick you up at 8:00.

19:12.734 --> 19:14.736
-Uh-huh.
-[Randy continues shrieking]

19:20.367 --> 19:22.369
Should you be smoking in here?

19:22.870 --> 19:23.954
There's an ashtray.

19:25.038 --> 19:27.374
-I think that's an award.
-[door opens]

19:28.000 --> 19:30.043
[man] Hi, sorry to keep you waiting. Hi.

19:30.669 --> 19:31.628
Jonathan.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.922
Hi. Hi.

19:37.593 --> 19:38.844
Yeah, I’m Sam.

19:38.927 --> 19:40.596
Uh, this is my daughter, Justine.

19:40.679 --> 19:42.389
She wrote a... good script.

19:42.472 --> 19:44.474
It’s, uh, you know, it's a very...

19:45.058 --> 19:46.351
personal, uh...

19:47.060 --> 19:50.022
You know what, she'll tell you.
She'll tell you.

19:53.150 --> 19:54.026
Um...

19:55.027 --> 19:56.820
Uh, sure, yeah. Uh...

19:57.696 --> 20:00.657
Well, the character is kinda based on me.

20:00.741 --> 20:01.700
Um...

20:02.618 --> 20:05.037
About a year ago,
I moved out here to Hollywood

20:05.120 --> 20:07.122
to meet my father for the first time.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.123
Only...

20:08.498 --> 20:11.001
-he didn't know he had a daughter.
-Shit.

20:11.668 --> 20:13.295
Yeah. It was weird.

20:13.587 --> 20:17.299
And all I knew were his movies,
which I worshiped.

20:17.758 --> 20:19.968
And, you know, he didn't know
what to do with me 'cause...

20:20.052 --> 20:23.597
what 50-year-old man wants
a teenage daughter dropped on them? So...

20:24.223 --> 20:26.892
he made me enroll in high school, and...

20:27.601 --> 20:30.687
basically the only way I survived, really,

20:31.146 --> 20:34.441
was because I met this group
of AV club nerds.

20:34.524 --> 20:37.110
And... they weren't the kind of nerds

20:37.194 --> 20:40.030
who were trying to get laid
by the hot girls. They were these...

20:40.656 --> 20:43.951
[sighs] ...weird, complicated kids,

20:44.034 --> 20:46.036
who were trying to make these...

20:46.119 --> 20:50.207
little movies in a-- in a town of people
trying to make big movies.

20:50.290 --> 20:53.543
And that made me think
about how weird it is to grow up

20:53.627 --> 20:54.795
in LA, you know?

20:55.629 --> 20:56.546
And...

20:56.755 --> 20:59.508
even though I was only here
for a few months, I mean...

20:59.591 --> 21:01.426
[speech rapidly quietens and echoes]

21:01.510 --> 21:04.638
[high-pitched tone ringing]

21:04.721 --> 21:07.182
[breathing heavily]

21:11.687 --> 21:15.399
[muted speech]

21:24.491 --> 21:25.659
[pages turning]

21:25.742 --> 21:26.785
[whooshing]

21:26.868 --> 21:28.912
[phone ringing]

21:32.624 --> 21:34.668
[at normal volume]
Well, it's great. We love it.

21:34.751 --> 21:36.670
And we'd love to do this with you.

21:36.753 --> 21:37.713
Awesome.

21:40.507 --> 21:42.843
Sorry, uh, what does that mean exactly?

21:42.926 --> 21:45.095
Uh, [stammers]
we'd like to make your movie.

21:45.178 --> 21:47.848
Uh,
so please don't sell it to anyone else.

21:48.056 --> 21:51.226
'Cause, um... Yeah. And we'll get
an official offer out, like, next week.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.769
Um, do you have an agent?

21:54.521 --> 21:56.398
[chuckles] Oh, my God!

21:56.481 --> 21:58.108
Did that just happen?

21:58.191 --> 22:01.528
I mean, is this what it feels like
when your entire life changes?

22:01.653 --> 22:04.531
[gasps] How much money do think
they're gonna give us?

22:04.614 --> 22:06.533
How do you... How do you get an agent?

22:07.075 --> 22:09.119
How are you so calm right now?

22:09.202 --> 22:12.205
Holy shit! I mean, we have to celebrate.
Where should we go?

22:12.456 --> 22:13.540
You know, I gotta...

22:14.416 --> 22:18.086
I gotta go see a guy about a thing.
Why don't you just take the car, and...

22:18.337 --> 22:19.838
and I'll get a cab, okay?

22:20.130 --> 22:21.465
-Seriously?
-[Sam] Yeah.

22:21.548 --> 22:23.633
What the fuck?
Who am I supposed to celebrate with?

22:23.717 --> 22:25.218
[Sam] I don't know. Billy?

22:25.302 --> 22:27.804
Uh, maybe some of the other people
you wrote the movie about?

22:27.888 --> 22:29.514
I don't fucking know.
I don't fucking know.

22:30.349 --> 22:32.142
What is your problem?

22:32.225 --> 22:34.353
You're being so weird right now.

22:34.770 --> 22:35.937
[Sam exhales]

22:40.442 --> 22:41.818
-He-Hey...
-[car door slams]

22:42.527 --> 22:43.612
Justine...

22:45.447 --> 22:46.573
-[sighs]
-What?

22:49.993 --> 22:52.913
I just want you to know that I'm...
I'm very proud of you.

22:53.747 --> 22:54.831
And I love you.

22:57.542 --> 23:00.879
Okay. Whatever. Love you, too.

23:02.756 --> 23:04.383
[car engine starts]

23:04.466 --> 23:07.177
[tense electronic music playing]

23:17.979 --> 23:20.524
[panting]

23:22.109 --> 23:23.360
-Hey-- Hey, buddy.
-[man] Yeah?

23:23.443 --> 23:25.070
Hey, can you call me an ambulance, please?

23:25.153 --> 23:27.447
-Call me an ambulance. Okay?
-[man] Yeah, sure. Sure.

23:28.281 --> 23:29.491
Ah, fuck.

23:31.368 --> 23:32.494
Ah, come on.

23:33.495 --> 23:34.454
Come on.

23:34.955 --> 23:35.997
[exhales]

23:36.665 --> 23:37.541
[man] Thank you.

23:39.292 --> 23:40.252
Thank you.

23:40.919 --> 23:43.046
[in hoarse voice] How many dresses
did you get? Are you okay?

23:43.130 --> 23:45.424
Marty, can you hear us?

23:45.590 --> 23:46.967
[Marty, over intercom]
<i>I'm here, Mrs. Howard.</i>

23:47.050 --> 23:48.760
Is that our business manager?<i></i>
[clears throat]

23:48.844 --> 23:51.096
[Allen] <i>And me. Allen. I’m here, too.</i>

23:51.179 --> 23:52.055
Who’s Allen?

23:52.139 --> 23:54.433
The family lawyer. What is this, a coup?

23:55.016 --> 23:57.060
[sighs] Darling, as much as I’d like it,

23:57.144 --> 23:59.980
you can’t be on an allowance forever.

24:00.522 --> 24:02.399
You’re a grown, married man now.

24:02.607 --> 24:03.483
I knew it!

24:04.067 --> 24:06.403
Fine! Cut me off!

24:06.653 --> 24:10.031
We’re doing great out here, Birdie.
We can support ourselves.

24:10.115 --> 24:13.493
You can’t banish us. I banish <i>you!</i>

24:13.785 --> 24:15.787
Oh, sit down,
you're embarrassing yourself.

24:15.871 --> 24:17.038
We’re not on <i>Falcon Crest.</i>

24:17.414 --> 24:18.790
So you do watch television.

24:20.584 --> 24:21.585
Marty?

24:22.043 --> 24:24.713
[Marty] <i>Sebastian, when your grandfather</i>
<i>set up your trust,</i>

24:24.796 --> 24:28.550
<i>he allowed for a stipulation</i>
<i>that if you were to be married,</i>

24:28.633 --> 24:32.888
<i>you would bypass your living trustees,</i>
<i>your, uh, mother in this case,</i>

24:32.971 --> 24:35.390
<i>and unlock the whole of your funds.</i>

24:37.392 --> 24:38.894
[clears throat] Meaning?

24:39.978 --> 24:42.689
[Allen] <i>This is Allen now.</i>
<i>The full 40 million dollars,</i>

24:42.772 --> 24:46.776
<i>including the assets of your inheritance,</i>
<i>are yours to do with what you’d like.</i>

24:47.402 --> 24:48.653
[exhales]

24:49.279 --> 24:50.572
Forty million dollars?

24:50.655 --> 24:52.657
[up-tempo electronic music playing]

24:54.659 --> 24:57.037
[Rhonda chuckles in disbelief]

24:58.538 --> 24:59.498
You’re joking.

24:59.581 --> 25:01.333
Oh, yes, I’m the comic relief.

25:05.462 --> 25:07.130
[chuckles]

25:09.049 --> 25:10.675
-Hold on, hold on.
-What?

25:12.385 --> 25:15.055
-See?
-[both chuckling]

25:15.764 --> 25:18.475
It's nice to be on a date with a grown-up
for a change.

25:18.558 --> 25:20.101
Sure, babies can be a handful.

25:20.310 --> 25:23.647
Yes, babies.
That's exactly who I was talking about.

25:23.897 --> 25:26.650
You know,
I think I missed out on that stage.

25:27.526 --> 25:28.818
How old are your boys?

25:29.486 --> 25:31.154
Twenty-four now,

25:31.446 --> 25:33.156
Uh, 20 and 18.

25:35.283 --> 25:36.409
I missed a lot of it.

25:37.911 --> 25:39.037
Uh, that’s on me, though.

25:39.120 --> 25:41.790
My ex is a good woman, excellent mother.

25:42.958 --> 25:45.794
She used to say I was overextended
and unfocused. Well...

25:46.545 --> 25:49.673
in truth, I’m just a... a dabbler.

25:50.006 --> 25:51.633
What do you dabble in, Tex?

25:52.467 --> 25:55.053
Well, I had a ranch. I have ranches.

25:55.136 --> 25:56.638
Oh, you’re a rancher.

25:56.721 --> 25:57.722
I'm not a rancher.

25:57.806 --> 26:00.308
I have this ranch,
and the ranch had a mine on it.

26:00.392 --> 26:03.937
And, long story short, that mine produced
a semiconductor that they use in radios,

26:04.396 --> 26:07.899
which led me to what you call media...

26:08.400 --> 26:11.361
but I like to call it
buying up little radio stations,

26:11.444 --> 26:13.738
and we’re in expansion mode now, so...

26:13.947 --> 26:15.490
-[exhales forcefully]
-[Debbie laughs]

26:15.574 --> 26:17.200
What do you do, Debbie?

26:17.534 --> 26:18.910
Um, the same.

26:19.035 --> 26:20.036
[both chuckle]

26:20.120 --> 26:22.872
No, I... I'm also a dabbler. Uh...

26:23.456 --> 26:25.333
I just make way less money.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.502
Um, I-- I'm a producer and an actress.

26:28.128 --> 26:29.045
Uh...

26:29.170 --> 26:30.630
And I'm a wrestler.

26:31.047 --> 26:31.881
Uh?

26:31.965 --> 26:34.426
-I, uh, produce a wrestling show.
-[laughs] What?

26:34.634 --> 26:37.887
At the Fan-Tan,
that I also happen to star in.

26:38.555 --> 26:41.099
You're having dinner with Liberty Belle,

26:41.182 --> 26:43.852
one of the Gorgeous Ladies Of Wrestling.

26:43.935 --> 26:45.395
Oh, my God!

26:45.478 --> 26:46.563
-[Debbie] Uh-huh.
-I thought I was sitting

26:46.646 --> 26:47.814
with somebody special.

26:47.897 --> 26:48.982
[both laugh]

26:49.065 --> 26:51.860
Yeah, well... No, I am...
I'm trying to-- to transition more

26:51.943 --> 26:54.446
into the producing side of things.
It's just, um...

26:55.655 --> 26:57.741
I don't know, it hasn't been easy. And...

26:57.907 --> 26:59.242
Especially with a kid.

27:00.285 --> 27:01.453
Mostly, I'm just...

27:01.661 --> 27:03.246
staring down the barrel of life,

27:03.330 --> 27:05.248
wondering what the hell
I'm aiming for, Tex.

27:06.666 --> 27:09.544
You know my name's not really...
Tex, right?

27:10.712 --> 27:11.796
Oh, my God.

27:12.297 --> 27:13.173
What?

27:13.632 --> 27:14.924
Why did I make up that name?

27:15.008 --> 27:17.510
I don't know, the hat, or the accent,
or some such.

27:17.594 --> 27:19.012
You're an imaginative woman.

27:19.095 --> 27:21.598
-I’m actually from Wyoming.
-[laughing] No, no, no!

27:21.681 --> 27:23.683
Yeah, up the street. Yeah.

27:23.975 --> 27:26.019
-[laughs] Oh, my God. Jesus.
-Ah...

27:27.687 --> 27:28.647
What's your name?

27:28.730 --> 27:30.732
It's... But... James.

27:30.857 --> 27:33.401
-No.
-James Joseph McCready. JJ.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.153
Okay. I'm gonna go.

27:35.612 --> 27:37.155
-No, stay.
-[laughs]

27:37.238 --> 27:40.492
-Okay, people call you JJ?
-They call me JJ. They do.

27:40.575 --> 27:41.534
God.

27:43.578 --> 27:45.246
Can I still call you Tex?

27:47.040 --> 27:48.833
You can call me whatever you want.

27:51.211 --> 27:53.213
[monitor beeping]

27:56.299 --> 27:57.592
Okay, Mr. Sylvia,

27:57.676 --> 28:01.346
so the results from your EKG confirm
that you've had a cardiac event.

28:03.598 --> 28:04.766
Just say heart attack.

28:06.518 --> 28:07.977
Yes. A heart attack.

28:09.396 --> 28:11.064
Believe it or not, you’re lucky.

28:11.523 --> 28:13.233
But consider this a wake-up call.

28:13.566 --> 28:16.611
At your age, it’s time to start laying off
the alcohol and cigarettes.

28:16.695 --> 28:19.155
You’ll have to change your diet,
start exercising.

28:19.698 --> 28:22.117
That’s what I've been doing.
I've been doing that.

28:22.200 --> 28:24.202
Well, then you're on the right path.

28:24.703 --> 28:27.038
We’re gonna keep you overnight
for observation, all right?

28:27.455 --> 28:28.998
Is there anyone you want us to call?

28:30.834 --> 28:31.960
[sighs]

28:34.504 --> 28:35.547
No.

28:42.887 --> 28:44.180
[Birdie] As soon as I get back,

28:44.264 --> 28:46.683
I’ll put you in touch
with our group at Morgan Stanley.

28:46.766 --> 28:48.309
We’ll get your portfolio all set up.

28:48.685 --> 28:50.562
Eventually, you’re gonna need a will.

28:50.645 --> 28:53.064
[sighs] Always thinking ahead.

28:53.481 --> 28:54.566
Thank you, Birdie.

28:58.570 --> 28:59.404
What's happening?

29:01.948 --> 29:03.074
You're married.

29:04.492 --> 29:06.244
[chuckles softly] I am.

29:09.497 --> 29:12.250
I didn’t feel a thing
at your sister’s wedding, but...

29:14.085 --> 29:15.712
I think I would have at yours.

29:20.049 --> 29:22.093
Well, we can always do something
when I get back.

29:22.552 --> 29:24.679
Oh, we will.
If you think you’re getting away

29:24.763 --> 29:27.098
without me throwing a giant party
that you’ll hate,

29:27.182 --> 29:28.475
you're out of your mind.

29:30.393 --> 29:32.645
Consider having children
while I’m still young enough

29:32.729 --> 29:34.522
to be mistaken for their mother.

29:34.606 --> 29:35.690
[chuckles]

29:38.860 --> 29:41.488
-Thank you so much for everything.
-Oh.

29:42.155 --> 29:43.531
And for making Bash.

29:45.283 --> 29:46.618
Oh. [chuckles]

29:51.331 --> 29:52.916
Keep him interested.

29:57.212 --> 29:59.464
However you see fit.

30:03.301 --> 30:04.511
[car door opens]

30:05.470 --> 30:06.429
[car door closes]

30:06.554 --> 30:08.556
[car engine starts]

30:09.432 --> 30:11.059
Thank you. Thank you.

30:12.560 --> 30:13.436
Um...

30:13.937 --> 30:18.983
How’s about... you come back to my hotel,
and I buy you that drink?

30:20.235 --> 30:22.111
You’re always trying to get me drunk.

30:22.445 --> 30:23.279
Yeah.

30:23.780 --> 30:26.783
How about, instead of a drink tonight,

30:27.742 --> 30:28.868
you let me...

30:29.452 --> 30:31.120
take you out again tomorrow?

30:33.623 --> 30:37.293
That’s moving a little fast for me,
Tex from Wyoming.

30:38.044 --> 30:40.797
-You just invited me to your hotel.
-Oh, yeah.

30:57.313 --> 30:59.816
-I like kissing wrestlers.
-[laughs]

31:00.984 --> 31:02.861
-Okay. Tomorrow night.
-Okay.

31:04.279 --> 31:06.281
[gentle acoustic music playing]

31:50.825 --> 31:52.827
[water pouring]

31:53.411 --> 31:54.829
[Justine] Jesus Christ.

31:56.664 --> 31:57.749
What the hell?

31:58.499 --> 32:00.627
I was about to call the police.
Where were you?

32:05.632 --> 32:06.674
Sorry.

32:07.050 --> 32:08.635
Old habits die hard.

32:09.302 --> 32:11.304
[Justine] You're such a bastard.

32:11.554 --> 32:13.765
I wanted to celebrate with you.

32:13.848 --> 32:16.059
Instead, I had the worst night with Billy.

32:16.142 --> 32:17.101
Oh, yeah?

32:17.602 --> 32:19.437
-How's Billy?
-Fat.

32:19.938 --> 32:23.191
I mean, still cute,
but he definitely put on a few.

32:23.274 --> 32:25.860
And he dragged me to some terrible club
that smelled like feet,

32:25.944 --> 32:28.655
and I ended up helping some girl
look for her purse for, like, an hour.

32:29.238 --> 32:32.450
-Yeah? You should put that in your movie.
-[Justine] Our movie.

32:33.701 --> 32:34.577
No.

32:35.161 --> 32:36.537
It's your journey now, kid.

32:38.665 --> 32:41.042
So, what? You don't want to direct it?

32:44.170 --> 32:45.546
What are you talking about?

32:45.630 --> 32:47.507
[scoffs] I fucking knew it.

32:47.590 --> 32:50.510
You were so wrapped up
in your old shit with what’s-his-face,

32:50.593 --> 32:54.681
the Zen prick, you weren’t even listening.
And you want me to give a shit? Okay, man.

32:55.890 --> 32:56.891
What?

32:58.601 --> 32:59.435
What?

32:59.936 --> 33:02.271
I told that guy I wouldn’t do it
without you directing.

33:02.438 --> 33:03.648
Why would you say that?

33:03.731 --> 33:06.025
[Justine] Will you calm down?
What is the matter with you?

33:06.109 --> 33:07.485
I can't fucking direct.

33:07.568 --> 33:10.321
I haven’t directed anything good in years.
I mean, maybe ever.

33:10.405 --> 33:13.199
Bullshit! And... too bad.

33:13.491 --> 33:16.452
Justine, you don’t have to bring me
with you, all right? I’m dead weight.

33:16.536 --> 33:19.706
So, you can believe in me,
but I can’t believe in you?

33:19.789 --> 33:22.834
I-- I-- I wrote a movie,
I sold that movie,

33:22.917 --> 33:25.420
I demanded you direct that movie, so...

33:25.712 --> 33:27.505
we’re making that fucking movie!

33:27.588 --> 33:28.423
Together.

33:28.506 --> 33:31.342
[stammers] Or at least until we both
get found out and fired.

33:31.592 --> 33:33.177
Jesus Christ!

33:35.638 --> 33:37.140
We should celebrate!

33:41.352 --> 33:42.353
-Yeah!
-[glasses clink]

33:43.104 --> 33:46.441
That’s what I’ve been trying to say, jerk.

33:48.151 --> 33:49.736
-We're making a movie.
-[Justine laughs]

33:49.819 --> 33:52.697
-Yeah, we're making a movie.

34:05.293 --> 34:08.796
Mm! [exhales
