WEBVTT

00:00.862 --> 00:02.069
Okay, I'm off to work.

00:02.069 --> 00:04.496
Oh, the hell you are!

00:05.205 --> 00:06.057
What?

00:07.107 --> 00:09.686
Gabi, this place is messier than your life.

00:09.742 --> 00:12.410
Okay, well, when I sleep
out here, this is my bedroom.

00:12.411 --> 00:15.123
Okay, but when we wake
up, it is our living room.

00:15.361 --> 00:16.853
Fine.

00:19.491 --> 00:21.559
Cleaning is so hard.

00:26.423 --> 00:27.824
Ugh!

00:30.477 --> 00:31.651
Happy?

00:31.652 --> 00:34.095
I will be when we get
a two-bedroom apartment.

00:34.096 --> 00:37.517
Well, you're never gonna be, then, because
nobody leaves this rent-controlled building

00:37.518 --> 00:39.353
unless they're rolled out of here.

00:42.552 --> 00:43.720
Oh, my God!

00:43.721 --> 00:45.589
That's Mrs. Jacobsen from 2B.

00:45.590 --> 00:46.992
Wha-what happened?

00:46.993 --> 00:47.810
She fell.

00:47.811 --> 00:50.415
She stumbled from the master
bedroom, through the guest bathroom,

00:50.416 --> 00:51.971
hit her head on the washer/dryer,

00:51.972 --> 00:53.475
then collapsed in the second bedroom.

00:53.645 --> 00:55.147
Dead.

00:55.205 --> 00:58.224
Oh, my God, I can't
believe Mrs. Jacobsen...

00:58.225 --> 00:59.993
had a second bedroom!

01:00.157 --> 01:03.431
Gabi, poor Mrs. Jacobsen!
May she rest in peace.

01:03.432 --> 01:06.001
Yes, and may I rest in her second bedroom!

01:06.002 --> 01:07.637
Okay, that is so mean.

01:07.638 --> 01:10.040
Really? Meaner than when she called
you a whore for wearing pants?

01:10.041 --> 01:11.625
Oh, that's right.

01:11.626 --> 01:14.428
We are so getting that
dead bitch's apartment.

01:15.189 --> 01:16.957
Well, how? I mean, this is San Francisco.

01:16.958 --> 01:18.369
Apartments are really hard to find.

01:18.370 --> 01:20.138
I bet that paramedic already
has an application in for it.

01:20.139 --> 01:21.594
Yeah, but we know the landlord.

01:21.595 --> 01:23.378
So, all we gotta do is
convince him to give it to us.

01:23.379 --> 01:26.488
And, I read an article that said you
can get anything you want from a man

01:26.489 --> 01:28.348
if you give him food or sex.

01:28.964 --> 01:31.044
You had to read an article to know that?

01:31.961 --> 01:33.455
- Dibs on food!
- Wait!

01:57.835 --> 02:01.605
Wow, you're going all
out for Josh's breakfast.

02:01.605 --> 02:03.740
What mistake are you
making up for this time?

02:03.740 --> 02:07.511
Actually, I'm making pierogies
to butter up my Russian landlord.

02:07.511 --> 02:10.114
Oh. So you don't just screw up our lives?

02:10.114 --> 02:12.395
No. Didn't I tell you the good news?

02:12.396 --> 02:14.685
The lady across the hall died of a stroke!

02:15.919 --> 02:18.622
Good morning, beautiful people!

02:18.622 --> 02:20.023
You know who's starving? Me.

02:20.023 --> 02:21.422
You know why? Sex.

02:21.423 --> 02:22.793
You know how much? Tons.

02:24.062 --> 02:25.254
You know how they say

02:25.255 --> 02:27.569
older women are awesome 'cause
they know all kinds of stuff?

02:27.570 --> 02:29.369
They do.

02:30.767 --> 02:32.870
Older women? Who's the lucky lady?

02:32.870 --> 02:34.505
Hey!

02:34.505 --> 02:37.608
No! You picked her over me?

02:37.608 --> 02:40.679
Sorry, Elliot. I got a
little something Josh wants.

02:40.898 --> 02:42.866
You got a little something he doesn't.

02:44.214 --> 02:45.884
I don't want anything from either of you.

02:45.885 --> 02:47.415
Because I'm getting plenty from Shauna.

02:48.886 --> 02:52.222
Josh is just letting me stay here
'cause I got in a fight with Coleman.

02:52.222 --> 02:54.791
What? You guys just moved in
together. You're already fighting?

02:54.791 --> 02:57.319
I know. But, I didn't like
the way he tipped the waitress.

02:57.320 --> 02:59.663
- Oh, what'd he leave her?
- His phone number.

03:01.732 --> 03:03.000
Hi, lover.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.002
And I'm talking to the tall, white one.

03:05.513 --> 03:09.002
Guys, this is my girlfriend.

03:09.021 --> 03:12.337
Oh my God, you're not a
girl, you're Shauna Stevens!

03:12.338 --> 03:14.383
You're the tech reporter for ABC News.

03:14.384 --> 03:17.621
My boyfriend's a programmer, and he
has a poster of you above his bed.

03:17.753 --> 03:19.791
Oh, so he's the one who bought that.

03:20.951 --> 03:22.057
She's being modest.

03:22.070 --> 03:24.931
She actually has two Peabody Awards
and Anderson Cooper on speed dial.

03:25.182 --> 03:27.372
I have a poster of him over my bed.

03:27.709 --> 03:30.840
So, Shauna, I was wondering, maybe we
spend the night at your place, tonight?

03:30.841 --> 03:32.199
You know, I still haven't been there.

03:32.200 --> 03:35.606
Uh, we can't. I just had the floors
cleaned, and it's kind of a mess.

03:35.607 --> 03:39.362
Hmm, well, you know I don't
mind things a little bit dirty.

03:39.407 --> 03:42.437
Oh, and I just remembered,
the water's also been shut off.

03:42.605 --> 03:44.941
Well, maybe we should
call somebody to fix it?

03:44.942 --> 03:47.402
I hear Anderson Cooper's good with pipes...

03:48.152 --> 03:49.970
You know, Shauna, if I
didn't know any better,

03:49.971 --> 03:51.748
I'd think you were trying
to hide something from me.

03:52.033 --> 03:55.748
I'll tell you what. How about
we hide something later...

03:56.288 --> 03:57.389
See you tonight?

04:00.180 --> 04:02.649
Oh, she's got good hiding places.

04:09.103 --> 04:10.805
That's the landlord!

04:10.806 --> 04:11.974
He's on his way up.

04:11.975 --> 04:14.444
My pierogies are hot and ready.

04:15.697 --> 04:16.950
So are mine.

04:19.192 --> 04:21.695
Wow! You look amazing.

04:21.731 --> 04:24.670
But, um, I think you're a little lopsided.

04:24.734 --> 04:25.768
Oh, well, you know,

04:25.769 --> 04:28.131
we ran out of toilet paper before
I could finish stuffing lefty.

04:28.132 --> 04:28.794
Huh.

04:29.446 --> 04:31.315
So uh, how'd you get him up here, so fast?

04:31.316 --> 04:34.219
Oh, well, I told him the sink was clogged.

04:34.220 --> 04:35.886
From all of our pillow fights.

04:35.887 --> 04:39.091
Great, great.

04:39.092 --> 04:41.135
Um, I only ask you this because I know you:

04:41.136 --> 04:42.654
Did you remember to clog the sink?

04:44.869 --> 04:47.413
Oh, quick! Put a little of
your bigger boobie in there!

04:48.775 --> 04:49.903
- Ah!
- That's him.

04:49.904 --> 04:51.472
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

04:52.047 --> 04:53.082
Come in.

04:53.488 --> 04:55.923
Hello, girls. Which sink is clogged?

04:58.187 --> 05:02.527
I think it may have gotten clogged while
I was making my world famous pierogies.

05:03.926 --> 05:05.094
Do you want one?

05:05.094 --> 05:06.336
No.

05:10.265 --> 05:11.266
Sink fixed. I go now.

05:11.266 --> 05:13.135
Wait! Um...

05:13.135 --> 05:16.805
We heard that apartment 2B opened up?

05:19.212 --> 05:20.736
Everyone wants 2B.

05:20.737 --> 05:23.899
Girl in 4A offered to do
disgusting things for 2B.

05:24.987 --> 05:26.822
And she's got two Dâ€™s.

05:27.585 --> 05:31.589
Just because I lost wife they
think they can sex me for apartment.

05:31.590 --> 05:34.560
Oh, that is pathetic.

05:35.180 --> 05:36.442
I have allergies.

05:38.280 --> 05:39.613
I go now.

05:40.452 --> 05:41.453
Oh.

05:41.454 --> 05:43.189
Or, maybe I stay.

05:43.971 --> 05:46.941
Hey, girls. Josh was getting
busy with the anchorwoman.

05:46.942 --> 05:50.212
And the buzzin' I heard was
not from the news chopper.

05:51.917 --> 05:54.753
So, is-is it cool if I
watch Law & Order here?

05:54.753 --> 05:57.389
I... I love the Law & Order.

05:58.665 --> 05:59.856
And my wife's dead.

06:01.769 --> 06:05.906
Well, great, come on in,
sit down, both of you!

06:05.906 --> 06:09.977
Yeah, what goes better with the
Law & Order than the pierogies?

06:11.347 --> 06:13.015
Maybe a white Russian?

06:21.357 --> 06:24.114
Okay, if anybody asks,
you're here to borrow my car.

06:24.115 --> 06:25.132
Oh, really?

06:25.133 --> 06:27.514
I shouldn't say that I'm here to
trick Yolanda into dating our landlord

06:27.515 --> 06:29.183
so we can get that apartment?

06:29.184 --> 06:30.314
You know, hopefully,

06:30.315 --> 06:33.337
you can keep your sarcasm
in our new walk-in closet.

06:34.253 --> 06:35.402
I just really want this.

06:35.403 --> 06:36.846
I have two bedroom fever.

06:38.301 --> 06:39.840
- Hey, Yolanda.
- Hey, girls.

06:39.841 --> 06:41.566
Nothing, I'm just here to borrow her car.

06:43.160 --> 06:45.860
So, how's it, ah, how's
it going with Coleman?

06:45.861 --> 06:47.992
Ah, do you still want him
to walk in front of a bus?

06:47.993 --> 06:49.682
Oh, no, honey.

06:50.018 --> 06:51.467
I wanna push him in front of one.

06:52.374 --> 06:55.474
Um, well, you know, I-I
actually just had an idea.

06:55.575 --> 06:56.674
Just now.

06:56.675 --> 06:59.417
Um, I feel like Coleman needs
a taste of his own medicine.

06:59.418 --> 07:01.613
Maybe you should go out with
another guy and make him jealous?

07:01.614 --> 07:03.744
That's a great idea,
Gabi. That'll teach him.

07:06.820 --> 07:09.403
It would teach him. Only one problem.

07:09.404 --> 07:11.660
If I knew a guy, I
wouldn't date my ex-husband.

07:11.824 --> 07:14.382
Well, I just had another idea.

07:14.383 --> 07:15.444
Just now.

07:15.862 --> 07:18.463
Um, what about Dmitri?

07:18.549 --> 07:21.001
Another great idea, Gabi!

07:22.450 --> 07:23.928
Ooh...

07:23.929 --> 07:27.899
Your sexy Russian
landlord? That guy is fine.

07:27.900 --> 07:29.674
Um, you think you two can...

07:29.675 --> 07:31.897
Sanfran Cafe 8:00 pm. Don't be late.

07:37.248 --> 07:40.768
Oh, how was your run, mate?
Would you like a spot o' brekkie?

07:41.292 --> 07:44.458
I Googled Australian slang. I'm a delight.

07:45.323 --> 07:46.977
Can I have a cuppa?

07:47.089 --> 07:50.020
Er, that means "cup of tea."

07:50.021 --> 07:52.891
Oh, right, sorry. I
didn't make it to the C's.

07:53.261 --> 07:56.531
- Gabi, you seem close with Josh.
- Why, what'd he tell you?

07:56.924 --> 07:59.660
I mean, I'm just kidding. We're close.

07:59.929 --> 08:01.464
Can I ask you a question?

08:01.758 --> 08:03.259
A questie?

08:03.934 --> 08:07.471
Do you think it's wrong to keep a secret
from someone just for a little while

08:07.471 --> 08:08.972
with only good intentions, of course.

08:08.972 --> 08:13.410
Well, between you and me, I don't
even need the good intentions part.

08:13.410 --> 08:15.012
Yeah, you are a delight.

08:15.012 --> 08:16.914
So, what's the secret?

08:17.781 --> 08:19.399
I'm a mum.

08:19.737 --> 08:21.618
What? You are?

08:21.618 --> 08:24.086
I share custody of my
seven-year-old son, Brett.

08:24.087 --> 08:26.336
And, I'm afraid to tell Josh.

08:26.337 --> 08:28.212
That's why I've been acting so dodgy.

08:28.553 --> 08:31.853
"Dodgy." That's a good one.

08:31.854 --> 08:34.813
Um, well, listen, about Josh, I don't
think you have anything to worry about.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.451
Josh loves little guys.

08:36.452 --> 08:37.453
You've met Elliot.

08:38.994 --> 08:40.796
You're right, Gabi.

08:41.227 --> 08:44.330
Now I just need to find
the right time to tell him.

08:44.531 --> 08:47.701
Why don't you tell him after brekkie,

08:47.702 --> 08:49.459
when he's had a cuppa,

08:49.460 --> 08:51.655
unless you think that's too dodgy.

08:51.656 --> 08:53.124
G'day!

08:58.878 --> 09:02.181
Josh, I did something bad.

09:02.967 --> 09:05.169
I got Anderson Cooper's phone number.

09:05.170 --> 09:06.575
Why is that bad?

09:06.576 --> 09:07.977
I stole Shauna's phone to get it.

09:07.977 --> 09:10.847
- Elliot!
- Oh, it gets worse.

09:10.847 --> 09:12.744
In the midst of my mischief making,

09:12.745 --> 09:15.081
I discovered Shauna is cheating on you.

09:15.869 --> 09:17.237
What are you talking about?

09:17.743 --> 09:20.063
I stumbled upon a few texts she sent

09:20.064 --> 09:22.266
to some manwhore named Brett.

09:22.892 --> 09:24.576
You're being ridiculous,

09:24.577 --> 09:26.373
and you invaded her privacy!

09:27.177 --> 09:28.579
Read 'em to me.

09:29.729 --> 09:31.433
"I miss kissing your face."

09:31.933 --> 09:33.335
That's not so bad.

09:33.336 --> 09:35.561
"Can't wait to crawl into
bed with you tonight."

09:35.562 --> 09:36.796
Getting worse.

09:37.365 --> 09:40.401
"Bought a bunch of new toys
we can play with together."

09:41.785 --> 09:43.286
Oh, God.

09:43.554 --> 09:45.356
She bought us toys to play with, too.

09:50.492 --> 09:52.494
Oh my God, they got towel warmers on sale.

09:52.495 --> 09:53.309
Should I get one?

09:53.310 --> 09:55.583
No. Get two. One for each bathroom!

09:56.928 --> 09:59.027
You know what, we're getting
too excited about this.

09:59.028 --> 10:00.997
We don't even know how Dmitri
and Yolanda's date went.

10:00.998 --> 10:02.759
But, they left on their
date three hours ago.

10:02.760 --> 10:04.595
Can I at least just add to cart?

10:04.835 --> 10:06.526
Man, we are obsessing over this.

10:06.527 --> 10:08.895
We gotta find something that's
gonna take our mind of the apartment.

10:09.956 --> 10:12.459
Apartment. Huh. What apartment?

10:12.460 --> 10:13.546
Oh my God, it's not working.

10:13.547 --> 10:14.928
- We have to go over there!
- Okay.

10:16.518 --> 10:18.622
- Oh, girls.
- Oh, Dmitri.

10:18.747 --> 10:19.815
How did your date go?

10:20.693 --> 10:22.729
This is first date I've been on.

10:22.773 --> 10:24.274
Well, since wife dead.

10:25.240 --> 10:26.708
I thought it never happen,

10:26.709 --> 10:28.987
- but I'm in love!
- He's in love!

10:29.255 --> 10:31.141
Yolanda is bee's knees!

10:31.142 --> 10:35.346
Yeah. She is totally bee's knees.

10:35.757 --> 10:38.713
So, do you remember that one time

10:38.714 --> 10:40.983
where you said that you owe me? Well, I do.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.582
Um, I was just wondering,

10:42.583 --> 10:44.500
ah ha, if maybe this could possibly...

10:44.501 --> 10:45.903
- We want apartment 2B!
- Yeah.

10:46.354 --> 10:49.147
Girls, you scratch my
back, I scratch yours...

10:49.148 --> 10:50.741
With two-bedroom apartment!

10:50.742 --> 10:53.345
- Yay!
- Thank you!

10:53.445 --> 10:56.956
I-I've not been so happy
since release from labor camp.

10:57.640 --> 10:59.536
Thank you, thank you.

10:59.537 --> 11:01.236
I bring you lease on Monday.

11:01.237 --> 11:02.255
Okay.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.666
We got the apartment!

11:08.539 --> 11:11.845
Shauna, there's something
I wanna talk to you about.

11:11.846 --> 11:14.015
Isn't talk what we do after sex?

11:15.775 --> 11:17.210
Well, tonight, we're talking before.

11:19.157 --> 11:20.625
I know about Brett.

11:21.251 --> 11:23.564
Oh my God, how'd you find out?

11:24.192 --> 11:26.895
That doesn't matter, Josh.
I swear I was gonna tell you.

11:27.232 --> 11:29.134
But, you didn't.

11:29.233 --> 11:32.937
I was holding back because
I'm crazy about you.

11:32.938 --> 11:33.810
Are ya?

11:34.686 --> 11:36.012
Yes.

11:36.161 --> 11:38.450
That's why I would love
for you to meet him.

11:41.045 --> 11:43.514
Meet him? Brett?

11:43.514 --> 11:45.588
Why... why?

11:46.351 --> 11:49.520
Because you're the two men in my life.

11:49.520 --> 11:53.096
How would you feel if the three
of us had a little playdate?

11:57.228 --> 11:58.263
A play what now?

11:59.920 --> 12:01.121
Uh, okay.

12:01.122 --> 12:05.460
You want Brett to come here.

12:06.756 --> 12:09.025
And play with me and you?

12:09.307 --> 12:11.254
All of us together.

12:11.278 --> 12:14.114
Together... wow, together...

12:14.445 --> 12:16.501
Look, Josh, I know this
is a lot to take in.

12:16.502 --> 12:20.840
But, if you're not into it, it's... I'm
sorry, it's kind of a deal-breaker for me.

12:21.136 --> 12:23.610
Deal-breaker... wow.

12:24.503 --> 12:26.171
Deal-breaker.

12:28.232 --> 12:31.268
Ugh, it's work. I gotta
get down to the studio.

12:31.269 --> 12:34.139
A man in Arkansas proposed
to Siri, and she said yes!

12:35.947 --> 12:38.116
I'm sorry. I have to run.

12:38.703 --> 12:41.873
But, what do you say? I can
bring Brett here tomorrow night?

12:43.284 --> 12:46.788
Okay, honestly, I'm a
little nervous about this.

12:46.788 --> 12:48.008
Don't be.

12:48.446 --> 12:51.515
The three of us are gonna
have so much fun together!

12:53.656 --> 12:56.992
Now rest up. Brett can really wear you out.

13:01.932 --> 13:04.668
Josh, is there any furniture
that you don't need in here?

13:04.668 --> 13:08.939
Because I am signing the lease on my new
two-bedroom apartment tomorrow... whoa.

13:10.607 --> 13:12.377
What's going on with you?

13:12.586 --> 13:15.323
You will never believe the bomb
that Shauna dropped on me last night.

13:15.324 --> 13:17.360
Oh, did she finally tell you about Brett?

13:17.648 --> 13:20.089
Yeah! How do you know about Brett?

13:20.090 --> 13:22.698
Calm down, okay? It's not that big a deal.

13:23.053 --> 13:24.701
Maybe not for some guys.

13:24.702 --> 13:25.827
You are not some guys.

13:25.828 --> 13:28.777
You're not gonna freak out at the first
curveball your relationship throws you.

13:29.209 --> 13:33.079
I'm fine with the curves. It's
the balls I'm worried about.

13:33.905 --> 13:36.942
Gabi, the date was perfect!

13:36.943 --> 13:39.585
It ended with sex on the kitchen floor.

13:40.021 --> 13:41.193
Oh...

13:41.194 --> 13:43.162
Dmitri must have some moves.

13:43.163 --> 13:45.199
Did he have you on your bee's knees?

13:47.195 --> 13:49.633
Dmitri? I'm talking about Coleman.

13:49.634 --> 13:52.226
Your plan to make him jealous worked.

13:52.227 --> 13:54.270
- Girl, I'm moving back in.
- No!

13:54.271 --> 13:58.839
That's awful... ly fast
for you to forgive him.

14:00.066 --> 14:02.716
You, ah, you have to go on
another date with Dmitri.

14:02.855 --> 14:05.122
- Why would I do that?
- Because of the lease...

14:05.123 --> 14:09.291
Uh, it's the "lease" you could do

14:09.292 --> 14:11.928
to keep him super jealous.

14:13.455 --> 14:17.398
Gabi, I know you're not used
to one of your plans working,

14:18.655 --> 14:20.536
but this is the part
where you should be happy!

14:20.537 --> 14:23.171
Yeah, oh-oh, oh, yeah, I'm
tot... I'm totally happy.

14:23.172 --> 14:26.196
Hey, quick question. Can I interest you

14:26.196 --> 14:29.456
in some slightly used towel warmers?

14:33.737 --> 14:35.372
Yolanda's back with Coleman?

14:35.372 --> 14:37.374
Oh my God, Dmitri's gonna find out.

14:37.374 --> 14:40.377
We're not gonna get that apartment
and Mrs. Jacobsen died for nothing.

14:41.273 --> 14:43.542
Stop, okay, listen. We can still save this.

14:43.543 --> 14:46.024
We just have to make sure that
Dmitri doesn't call Yolanda

14:46.025 --> 14:48.360
until after we sign the
lease tomorrow morning.

14:48.361 --> 14:50.960
Stop it, okay. What's the point? It's over.

14:50.961 --> 14:54.531
I'm just gonna go take one last
look and kiss Gaston goodbye.

14:54.532 --> 14:55.931
Uh, who-who is Gaston?

14:56.084 --> 14:57.686
The dishwasher.

14:59.115 --> 15:00.149
I named him.

15:03.153 --> 15:04.659
Blonde one!

15:05.354 --> 15:07.056
I need advice.

15:07.081 --> 15:11.083
Should I invite Yolanda for wine
and spa experience in the Napa?

15:12.520 --> 15:13.988
I have Groupon.

15:13.989 --> 15:16.001
Listen, Dmitri, I have
to tell you something.

15:16.061 --> 15:17.992
Ah, Yolanda doesn't like you.

15:17.993 --> 15:19.261
There are jets in the bathtub!

15:19.262 --> 15:20.842
- She loves you.
- Oh!

15:20.843 --> 15:23.159
- Really?
- Uh, yes.

15:23.160 --> 15:24.840
But, we were sworn to secrecy.

15:24.841 --> 15:26.822
So, you can't tell her
that I told you, okay?

15:26.823 --> 15:29.887
Just... you know, just don't... actually,
you know what, don't talk to her at all.

15:29.888 --> 15:32.706
What? Why-why I no talk if she's in love?

15:32.707 --> 15:36.645
Uh, be-because in America you have to
wait three days before calling a woman.

15:36.646 --> 15:38.381
Otherwise you look needy.

15:39.469 --> 15:41.044
But, but I don't want to wait.

15:41.045 --> 15:42.313
In Russia, we have saying,

15:42.314 --> 15:44.145
"you snooze, you freeze to death."

15:46.442 --> 15:49.178
Well, we live in America.

15:49.215 --> 15:52.362
So, if you want Yolanda
to think you're a man,

15:52.363 --> 15:54.698
you know, just don't call
her until after Monday.

15:55.113 --> 15:57.181
You Americans so confusing.

15:57.182 --> 15:59.454
With my first wife, I ask her to marry me,

15:59.455 --> 16:01.554
she say "eh." Next morning we married.

16:06.639 --> 16:08.785
Okay. Here we go.

16:09.474 --> 16:11.643
Bill & Ted's Sexcellent Adventure.

16:12.411 --> 16:14.739
Let's see what this whole two
guys one girl stuff is about.

16:14.739 --> 16:16.347
Maybe it's not so bad.

16:18.320 --> 16:21.997
Mmm... uh-uh-uh, it is bad.

16:26.394 --> 16:27.959
Eww, what's that girl doing in there?

16:30.008 --> 16:32.511
Remember Brett? Guy
Shauna's cheating on me with?

16:32.511 --> 16:34.646
They're on their way over here
to have a threesome with me.

16:34.646 --> 16:35.865
Really?

16:35.872 --> 16:38.478
Well, as your publicist,
I think that's a bad idea.

16:38.479 --> 16:41.648
But, as your friend, you go, girl.

16:41.804 --> 16:44.641
Look, I only said yes
because Shauna's so cool.

16:44.642 --> 16:45.910
I didn't want to seem uncool,

16:45.911 --> 16:48.246
but I am uncool, Elliot.
I am uncool in that way.

16:48.247 --> 16:50.196
In every other way, I am cool.

16:50.197 --> 16:52.547
Josh, pull yourself together.

16:53.673 --> 16:54.965
That's them. Okay, look.

16:54.966 --> 16:57.348
Go out there and tell
them I can't do this, okay?

16:57.349 --> 16:58.986
- Just go... it's too hard.
- Too hard.

16:58.987 --> 17:00.092
No, I...

17:00.305 --> 17:03.074
don't say that. Uh, I gotta back out.

17:03.075 --> 17:04.143
Back out.

17:04.144 --> 17:05.679
That's even... Elliot!

17:06.307 --> 17:08.843
I'm working. You go out and there
and you tell them I'm working.

17:12.077 --> 17:14.817
Hey, Elliot, meet my son, Brett.

17:14.818 --> 17:16.003
This is Brett?

17:16.030 --> 17:18.866
And there's one of your new toys.

17:18.866 --> 17:21.202
Well, this is gonna be funny.

17:26.438 --> 17:27.605
Are they gone?

17:28.348 --> 17:30.885
Sorry, Josh, but you should go out there.

17:30.897 --> 17:32.298
Brett is cute.

17:32.299 --> 17:33.567
Might even be cuter than you.

17:33.568 --> 17:35.515
See, that's the problem!

17:35.516 --> 17:38.140
Either I'm gonna be second banana,
or he's gonna be second banana.

17:38.141 --> 17:39.976
Either way, it's too many bananas!

17:40.206 --> 17:41.812
Well, tell them yourself.

17:41.813 --> 17:43.150
But, be nice.

17:43.186 --> 17:45.931
I get the sense that if you hurt
his feelings, Brett might cry.

17:46.244 --> 17:47.469
Been there.

17:51.804 --> 17:53.873
Hi, Josh. I want you to meet...

17:53.874 --> 17:55.175
Shauna...

17:55.230 --> 17:57.003
I'm-I'm sorry. I can't do this.

17:57.004 --> 17:58.446
This is my son, Brett.

17:58.447 --> 17:59.802
The other man in my life.

17:59.803 --> 18:01.783
Brett, this is Josh.

18:01.990 --> 18:03.777
Hi, Josh. Do you want to see my truck?

18:05.702 --> 18:08.204
Oh, Brett!

18:08.479 --> 18:10.682
You are an adorable little man!

18:10.776 --> 18:12.744
I'm gonna buy you a real truck.

18:15.785 --> 18:17.391
Okay, everything's ready.

18:17.392 --> 18:19.372
Pens ready to sign, champagne ready to pop.

18:19.373 --> 18:21.353
Well, the only thing missing
is Dmitri with the lease,

18:21.354 --> 18:22.919
and he said he'd be here at 9:00.

18:22.920 --> 18:25.055
Relax, it's only 9:02.

18:25.528 --> 18:29.176
That is two extra minutes we could
have been renting that apartment.

18:31.577 --> 18:32.978
Oh my God, that's him.

18:35.157 --> 18:37.093
Both: Hey, Dmitri!

18:37.093 --> 18:38.861
What are you doing here? Oh, right!

18:38.861 --> 18:40.196
You're here to help us sign the lease.

18:40.197 --> 18:42.083
Right.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.156
Give it.

18:44.066 --> 18:45.739
So, ah, which pen should I use?

18:45.740 --> 18:48.204
I'm thinking a ball point,
roller ball, scented marker,

18:48.204 --> 18:49.446
glitter pen, ooh, a chopstick!

18:49.447 --> 18:50.689
My EpiPen!

18:51.682 --> 18:52.683
No pen!

18:54.477 --> 18:57.233
Because it's a Russian
custom to sign in blood?

18:57.234 --> 18:59.203
Because we are fine with that.

19:00.616 --> 19:03.152
Are you fine? Because Dmitri not so fine.

19:03.152 --> 19:06.189
You tell me not to call Yoyoski, I no call.

19:06.190 --> 19:08.027
But I am passionate
man, so I go to her house

19:08.028 --> 19:10.359
bearing gifts of vodka and smoked salmon.

19:12.918 --> 19:14.787
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, boy.

19:14.788 --> 19:17.057
And she get in huge fight with boyfriend.

19:17.446 --> 19:19.093
- Oh, boy.
- Uh-oh.

19:19.094 --> 19:21.752
All the way home I thinking
why would girls lie to me?

19:21.753 --> 19:24.801
And then, it hit me like a ton of brick.

19:25.208 --> 19:27.490
You manipulate me to get apartment!

19:27.491 --> 19:28.534
You bad girls!

19:28.535 --> 19:31.635
No, listen, Dmitri, we're
really, really sorry.

19:31.636 --> 19:33.360
Yes, please let us make it up to you.

19:33.361 --> 19:34.798
No. No apartment for you!

19:34.799 --> 19:36.601
I give to someone else.

19:36.602 --> 19:37.770
Someone who deserve it.

19:37.771 --> 19:39.606
What? No! Who?

19:39.607 --> 19:41.476
Hey!

19:43.306 --> 19:44.708
Got a pen?

19:48.608 --> 19:52.608
Now that was the best I'm
sorry calamari I've ever had.

19:53.128 --> 19:55.197
So, you forgive us for
totally screwing up your life?

19:55.198 --> 19:57.967
Well, in a way, you two
girls did me a favor.

19:57.968 --> 20:00.237
Coleman got so mad about Dmitri,

20:00.244 --> 20:04.148
he wound up admitting he
did cheat with the waitress.

20:04.638 --> 20:06.429
And his hairdresser.

20:06.875 --> 20:08.395
And the dog walker.

20:09.048 --> 20:10.349
We don't even have a dog!

20:11.387 --> 20:12.489
Ha!

20:12.490 --> 20:15.646
Okay, so what are we watching for
our first movie night, neighbor?

20:15.647 --> 20:18.840
I grabbed it from Josh's
office. It's a classic.

20:18.841 --> 20:21.410
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure.

20:27.723 --> 20:29.324
I didn't know Keanu was black.

20:31.954 --> 20:33.122
Why is everybody naked?

20:34.190 --> 20:36.125
They are really steaming
up that phone booth.

20:38.094 --> 20:39.428
Gimme that remote.

20:41.063 --> 20:42.498
I gotta turn this up.

20:44.133 --> 20:46.784
We are bad girls!
