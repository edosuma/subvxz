{\an5}ANNOUNCER:
And as Tony Hawk
begins his second run

00:54.220 --> 00:57.624
he is still ahead on points and
he has had an amazing afternoon.

00:57.690 --> 00:59.692
He is totally owning this ramp.

00:59.759 --> 01:01.194
Everyone is totally stoked.

01:01.261 --> 01:02.762
Today might be the day for 900.

01:02.829 --> 01:04.096
Oh, but not on this run.

01:04.164 --> 01:07.267
Tony is down,
and he is fully bummed on that.

01:07.333 --> 01:08.835
Not too happy at all.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.003
He grabs his...

01:10.069 --> 01:11.671
Twist, I'll trade you
my pickles

01:11.738 --> 01:13.139
for the rest
of your fries.

01:13.206 --> 01:15.975
{\an4}If Sammy will swap
me the pickles for
his onion rings.

01:16.042 --> 01:18.211
{\an4}Only if Reggie
will trade back
the pickles

01:18.278 --> 01:19.579
for the rest
of her shake.

01:19.646 --> 01:20.847
Quiet, you guys!

01:20.914 --> 01:23.283
I'm trying to watch Tony Hawk.

01:23.349 --> 01:25.018
ANNOUNCER:
He has the potential.

01:25.084 --> 01:26.186
He is poised up now.

01:26.252 --> 01:27.654
There he goes.

01:27.720 --> 01:29.289
He's going for it.
He did it!

900!

Tony Hawk landing the 900.

01:33.593 --> 01:35.628
Huh, he is pretty wicked tight.

01:35.695 --> 01:37.797
Yeah, he rips.

01:37.864 --> 01:38.832
Very impressive.

01:38.898 --> 01:40.200
Now, about those pickles.

01:40.266 --> 01:42.035
What are you talking about?

01:42.101 --> 01:43.503
He's way beyond that!

01:43.570 --> 01:46.439
He's the Hawk,
master of all skateboarding

01:46.506 --> 01:49.275
and someday I'm going to
skate with him.

Skate legend Tony Hawk

01:56.316 --> 01:57.984
vanished without
a trace yesterday

01:58.051 --> 02:01.087
amid strong rumors he's gone
to the mysterious Hawk's Nest

02:01.154 --> 02:03.957
perhaps never to skate again.

02:04.023 --> 02:07.861
{\an5}The Hawk... never...
skates... again?!

02:07.927 --> 02:10.395
Otto, it was bound
to happen sometime.

02:10.463 --> 02:11.397
No way!

02:11.464 --> 02:12.966
{\an1}I got to talk him
out of it.

02:13.032 --> 02:15.568
But he went to
the Hawk place thing.

02:15.635 --> 02:16.970
So I'm going there.

02:17.036 --> 02:19.339
Otto, no one knows
where that is.

02:19.405 --> 02:21.107
Actually, with the right data

02:21.174 --> 02:23.610
you can find
just about anybody nowadays.

02:23.676 --> 02:25.712
All you need is a computer.

I'm so there.

02:52.605 --> 02:54.040
Hold on, Rocket Boy--

02:54.107 --> 02:56.976
that place is all the way
on the other side of town.

to talk me out of it?

02:59.479 --> 03:01.481
No!

through all of this stuff

Maybe Hawk's kept

Front door?!

11:06.332 --> 11:09.201
SAM (<i> on monitor</i> ):
Down this alley.

11:12.004 --> 11:13.372
Hey, Otto,
before you go

11:13.439 --> 11:15.841
do you want to skate
this bowl with me?

11:18.611 --> 11:19.845
{\an5}Yeah!

11:18.611 --> 11:19.845
Go for it!

11:19.912 --> 11:21.147
Do it, Otto-man!

11:21.213 --> 11:23.582
Let's do it, Tony.

11:38.798 --> 11:45.471
ALL (<i> cheering</i> ):
Yeah! Go, Otto! All right.

12:24.977 --> 12:25.911
Yes!

12:25.978 --> 12:28.714
The O-Man strikes again!

12:28.781 --> 12:30.382
All right, Otto!

12:32.718 --> 12:34.386
REGGIE:
Whoa-ho-ho-ho!

12:35.754 --> 12:38.591
And Rocket Girl
nails the five-oh!

12:39.625 --> 12:40.559
Whoa!

12:40.626 --> 12:41.627
Oh...!

12:44.730 --> 12:46.899
(<i> blows whistle</i> )

12:46.966 --> 12:49.168
{\an1}Attention,
Madtown skaters!

12:49.235 --> 12:51.837
The official Madtown
"Let's Get Radical"

12:51.904 --> 12:54.607
Extreme Skateboard Championship
is next weekend.

12:54.673 --> 12:57.910
Contestants may either
enter Street or Vert division.

12:57.977 --> 12:59.044
Well, we all know

12:59.111 --> 13:01.080
that we'll be
signing up for:

13:01.147 --> 13:02.615
Vert city!

13:02.681 --> 13:03.616
Yeah, dudes--

13:03.682 --> 13:06.352
we're going to get vertical!

13:06.418 --> 13:07.887
{\an1}What about
grinding the rail

13:07.953 --> 13:09.255
or shredding
the stairs?

13:09.321 --> 13:11.290
And what about me
catching awesome air

13:11.357 --> 13:12.291
off the pipe?

13:12.358 --> 13:13.959
Vert is way cooler.

13:14.026 --> 13:15.828
Vert is so not cooler.

13:15.895 --> 13:17.463
Street skating
is old-school.

13:17.530 --> 13:20.266
{\an1}It was first,
therefore it is cooler.

13:21.333 --> 13:23.169
Conroy will settle this.

13:23.235 --> 13:24.570
You're a Street skater

13:24.637 --> 13:26.005
right Conroy?

13:26.071 --> 13:28.040
Well, man, I was a Street skater

13:28.107 --> 13:30.309
but they didn't
have Vert then, man.

13:30.376 --> 13:32.378
Now I like to rip it up in both.

13:32.444 --> 13:33.712
See?

13:32.444 --> 13:33.712
Told you!

13:33.779 --> 13:35.114
CONROY:
Okay, young Rastas

13:35.181 --> 13:37.316
you got to line up to sign up.

13:39.952 --> 13:42.388
Put me and Trish
down for Street!

13:42.454 --> 13:44.490
But I thought we
were always Vert.

13:44.557 --> 13:46.825
{\an5}Vert!

13:44.557 --> 13:46.825
{\an4}Street!

13:44.557 --> 13:46.825
Street!

13:44.557 --> 13:46.825
{\an1}Vert!

13:46.892 --> 13:47.826
{\an1}GIRL:
Vert!

13:47.893 --> 13:48.928
GIRL:
No, Street!

13:52.431 --> 13:55.201
{\an5}SAM:
I don't know,
I just can't decide.

13:55.267 --> 13:57.703
So maybe Vert <i> is</i> cooler.

13:57.770 --> 13:58.938
Then again

13:59.004 --> 14:00.839
{\an5}Street has
history on
its side.

14:00.906 --> 14:02.308
Two words, Squid:

14:02.374 --> 14:03.943
Vert rules!

14:04.009 --> 14:06.312
Street all the way!

14:06.378 --> 14:09.515
So, the waves are breaking
in two directions today

14:09.582 --> 14:10.983
huh, little cuzzes?

14:11.050 --> 14:13.686
You know, in our day
you were either a nose-rider

14:13.752 --> 14:14.687
or a tail-surfer.

14:14.753 --> 14:16.088
I liked surfing the nose

14:16.155 --> 14:16.789
but Tito...

14:16.855 --> 14:17.923
Sorry, brother.

14:17.990 --> 14:20.593
I was the nose,
you were the tail.

14:20.659 --> 14:22.094
Watch this, brother!

14:22.161 --> 14:24.630
Toes to the nose!

14:24.697 --> 14:26.432
{\an5}RAY:
Anyone
can do that.

14:26.498 --> 14:27.533
Check this out!

14:27.600 --> 14:30.402
Raymundo wails the tail!

14:30.469 --> 14:31.604
Whoa!

14:36.542 --> 14:39.044
{\an4}(<i> laughing</i> ):
Yeah, you're
really wailing now!

14:42.581 --> 14:44.583
TITO:
I'm sure it seemed

14:44.650 --> 14:46.585
like a good idea
at the time.

14:46.652 --> 14:48.120
(<i> agitated</i> ):
The point is

14:48.187 --> 14:49.888
one thing isn't
always better.

14:49.955 --> 14:51.690
Sometimes it's
just different.

14:51.757 --> 14:53.525
Like the ancient
Hawaiian said:

14:53.592 --> 14:57.029
{\an1}"You can't compare
pineapples and coconuts."

14:57.096 --> 15:00.232
The point is, pineapples
are better than coconuts

15:00.299 --> 15:02.301
and Vert is better than Street.

15:02.368 --> 15:03.902
Oh, yeah, Rocket Boy?

15:03.969 --> 15:07.806
{\an1}What about in other sports,
like biking, inlining...

15:07.873 --> 15:09.508
Vert rules all the way.

15:09.575 --> 15:11.210
And by the time
I'm through

15:11.277 --> 15:12.978
even Squid
will agree.

15:15.314 --> 15:17.383
Tito, if we're
sitting down here

15:17.449 --> 15:19.051
who's watching
the shack?

15:19.118 --> 15:21.887
Hmm, good question, brother.

15:21.954 --> 15:23.922
Oh-ho-ho...

15:23.989 --> 15:26.292
{\an5}Yeah, cool!

15:26.358 --> 15:27.526
Wow!

15:30.562 --> 15:31.530
Whoo-hoo!

15:30.562 --> 15:31.530
{\an1}Yeah!

Ah, Squid.

15:51.317 --> 15:54.353
See, wouldn't you
rather be in the pipe?

{\an1}Ready to give up,
Rocket Boy?

16:23.982 --> 16:26.952
Admit it, you're getting bored
of the half-pipe.

16:27.019 --> 16:29.021
{\an1}No way.

16:29.088 --> 16:31.590
From now on, my life
will be totally Vert

16:31.657 --> 16:33.325
day and night.

16:33.392 --> 16:35.094

16:35.160 --> 16:36.662
You know I am, bro.

16:36.729 --> 16:37.730

Who's with the Streets?

I'm with you, Reg.

It's Street for me.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.977
Well, the risk of injury

16:52.044 --> 16:56.515
is less from a lower height
so... I've decided...

16:56.582 --> 16:58.117
Street it is!

16:58.183 --> 16:59.385
