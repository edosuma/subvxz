00:01.468 --> 00:01.901
This is the

00:01.901 --> 00:02.602
Evergreen Forest.

00:03.336 --> 00:05.939
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:05.939 --> 00:09.976
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:09.976 --> 00:11.711
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:13.146 --> 00:15.248
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:15.849 --> 00:16.950
Yikes!

00:17.684 --> 00:19.019
Yaaaah...

00:21.988 --> 00:23.356
Yeaaaah!

00:23.356 --> 00:26.426
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:33.533 --> 00:36.136
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:37.570 --> 00:38.872
Cyril Sneer!

00:42.709 --> 00:44.778
And his life would be simple
except for...

00:45.879 --> 00:47.013
the Raccoons!!

00:47.013 --> 00:50.316
♪ (show theme music) ♪

00:57.924 --> 01:03.029

01:03.029 --> 01:04.864
Springtime
in the Evergreen Forest.

01:07.167 --> 01:08.868
The new leaves on the trees.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.004
The return of the Robin.

01:12.038 --> 01:14.507
And the dust billowing
out of Sneer mansion,

01:14.507 --> 01:16.409
as Cyril Sneer and
the pigs clean up,

01:16.409 --> 01:20.647
making out with the old
and in with the new.

01:20.647 --> 01:22.682
Eeeeh-ugh!

01:22.682 --> 01:28.354
The Pig: Uuuuh-ugh-uhg-uuuugh!

01:28.354 --> 01:29.489
Look at this,

01:29.489 --> 01:32.358
the first annual
Evergreen Forest games.

01:32.358 --> 01:34.260
Huh! What's the prize?

01:34.260 --> 01:37.864
Pig 1: Sir, it's the
prestigious athletic cup.

01:37.864 --> 01:39.432
They call that a trophy?!

01:39.432 --> 01:42.569
In my day you needed
to be a real athlete

01:42.569 --> 01:44.404
to win a track and field event!

01:44.404 --> 01:46.539
And I should know,
I won enough of them!

01:55.648 --> 01:58.952
Ah, if I were only
30 years younger,

01:58.952 --> 02:01.754
I'd give anything to
relive those days.

02:04.224 --> 02:05.525
Pig 2: Anything?

02:05.525 --> 02:09.762
You know guys, anything
just might mean a raise.

02:09.762 --> 02:11.431
Pig 3: A raise?

02:11.431 --> 02:14.801
- Ohh boy!
- But that's impossible!

02:14.801 --> 02:18.538
The boss can never be his old,
I mean, young-self again.

02:27.113 --> 02:29.949
Pig 2: Well, maybe he
could be young again.

02:29.949 --> 02:33.086
Pig 1&3: Oooh... yes!!

02:34.154 --> 02:36.556
Woof!

02:36.556 --> 02:38.158
Boy Broo,

02:38.158 --> 02:42.262
If I can pick this up, I'm a
cinch to win the forest games,

02:42.262 --> 02:45.598
that... that cup is all mine!

02:47.433 --> 02:50.737
The way I figure it,
if I can run 5 miles a day

02:50.737 --> 02:52.305
for the next week,

02:52.305 --> 02:56.176
by Monday, I should be
35 miles from home.

02:59.145 --> 03:03.683
Oh boy! I...I feel
stronger, already.

03:05.485 --> 03:07.120
Oh! Oh-huh!

03:12.458 --> 03:15.261
Bleeeee!

03:15.261 --> 03:16.296
Come on, Broo.

03:18.298 --> 03:21.868
Melissa/Ralph:

03:23.002 --> 03:25.004
Hi Bert,
how was your run?

03:30.510 --> 03:31.811
That's nice.

03:31.811 --> 03:34.614
I'm glad to see your
runs getting easier, Bert.

03:36.616 --> 03:38.651
Guess what
Burt, good news!

03:38.651 --> 03:41.020
We're going to have a house
guest for the next few days.

03:41.020 --> 03:43.656
That's right, Bert.
Cousin Bentley!

03:43.656 --> 03:47.493
A kid, here?
Hey, that's great Melissa!

03:47.493 --> 03:51.097
I can take him fishing
and canoeing

03:51.097 --> 03:53.366
and to the home
improvement shows...

03:53.366 --> 03:56.069
You know, all of the
things kids like.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.638
Gee Bert,
Bentley may not be exactly

03:58.638 --> 04:00.473
the kind of kid you expect.

04:00.473 --> 04:03.810
Ahh, kids are kids.
Plain and simple.

04:03.810 --> 04:06.246
I never met one I didn't like!

04:06.246 --> 04:08.548
Yaaahoooo! Ha-haaa!

04:08.548 --> 04:10.850
Someone to train
for the games with!

04:12.719 --> 04:13.820
Hi, pop.

04:15.588 --> 04:19.325
Hey, pop, can I borrow
those old track shoes of yours,

04:19.325 --> 04:23.363
and your old varsity sweater?
It's for the track meet.

04:23.363 --> 04:26.566
These shoes and I saw a
lot of good years together.

04:26.566 --> 04:31.104
And this sweater, it went great
with my old raccoon skin coat.

04:31.104 --> 04:34.374
Pop!!!
Just a joke Cedric.

04:34.374 --> 04:36.142
Here, guard them with your life.

04:36.142 --> 04:38.211
Uhm, thanks, pop.

04:39.445 --> 04:41.614
Yep, those were the days.

04:41.614 --> 04:44.250
Ladies and gentlemen,

04:44.250 --> 04:46.786
in the 100 yard dash,

04:46.786 --> 04:51.124
Cyril Sneer takes first place.

04:51.124 --> 04:55.795
In the long jump,
Cyril Sneer, 1st place.

04:55.795 --> 04:58.931
For sportsmanlike conduct,

04:58.931 --> 05:02.635
Cyril Sneer, last place.

05:03.336 --> 05:06.072
Aaah,
those were the days.

05:08.408 --> 05:10.476
Were they ever!
Sir, Sir!

05:10.476 --> 05:11.878
What's the big idea,

05:11.878 --> 05:14.947
barging in like this?
Invading my privacy?

05:14.947 --> 05:17.984
Pig 2: Sir, we have the answer
to your problem.

05:17.984 --> 05:20.253
What?!
What are you blabbering about?

05:20.253 --> 05:22.922
Pig 1: We can
make you young again.

05:22.922 --> 05:24.724
The Pig 3: Look at this, Sir.

05:28.761 --> 05:30.897
The search for the
Fountain of Youth?

05:30.897 --> 05:32.365
What's this all about?

05:32.365 --> 05:34.100
Pig 2: According
to this book, Sir,

05:34.100 --> 05:37.503
one sip from this legendary
elusive fountain

05:37.503 --> 05:40.139
can give someone eternal youth.

05:40.139 --> 05:42.775
Eternal youth?!
Preposterous!

05:42.775 --> 05:44.777
Ridiculous!

05:44.777 --> 05:46.179
Ludicrous!!

05:48.247 --> 05:49.349
Find it immediately!!

05:49.349 --> 05:53.152
Ohh, yes Sir,
yes Sir! Immediately!

05:53.152 --> 05:56.322
Oh joy, oh bliss!!

05:56.322 --> 05:58.358
Bert, come on down!

05:58.358 --> 06:00.193
There's someone here to see you.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.894
I'll be right there!

06:02.695 --> 06:04.997
Yay! Aaaaah!

06:06.866 --> 06:09.736
Oh, h-h-hi!

06:09.736 --> 06:11.637
You must be Bentley?

06:11.637 --> 06:13.439
And you
must be hurt.

06:13.439 --> 06:16.142
That's, um, Bert.

06:16.142 --> 06:17.510
How was your trip?

06:17.510 --> 06:19.512
Fine,
how was yours?

06:19.512 --> 06:22.515
Bentley, you're going
to be sharing Bert's room.

06:22.515 --> 06:25.184
Mr Bert,
pleased to interface

06:25.184 --> 06:26.519
with your acquaintance.

06:26.519 --> 06:29.822
Hey, smart kid there!
He-he!

06:29.822 --> 06:32.058
He knows a foreign language!

06:32.058 --> 06:33.459
By the way, Bentley...

06:34.260 --> 06:35.795
Bentley?!

06:35.795 --> 06:39.632
Um, Melissa, is Bentley
always this friendly?

06:39.632 --> 06:41.534
Well,
he's never had a chance

06:41.534 --> 06:43.536
to make friends very easily.

06:43.536 --> 06:45.738
His family moved so much
that he never lived

06:45.738 --> 06:47.206
in one place long enough,

06:47.206 --> 06:50.376
and now his computers
come to mean a lot to him.

06:50.376 --> 06:53.379
Well, it's come to
mean a little too much to him,

06:53.379 --> 06:54.414
if you ask me.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.048
I think it's
time he found out

06:56.048 --> 06:58.217
what a real
friend can be.

06:58.217 --> 07:00.586
Hey Bentley, old pal, uhm...

07:00.586 --> 07:02.755
why don't you set up
this thing later?

07:02.755 --> 07:05.358
Hey, let's have a game
of Chinese checkers,

07:05.358 --> 07:08.961
Well, how about a
friendly game of cards?

07:09.862 --> 07:11.998
I could set up
the ping pong table?

07:15.401 --> 07:18.571
No Bert, according
to my careful calculations,

07:18.571 --> 07:21.107
playing games can be
hazardous to your health.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.309
Ahh boy!

07:23.309 --> 07:26.112
Gee Bert, maybe you
should take Bentley outdoors

07:26.112 --> 07:27.547
and and show
him the forest.

07:27.547 --> 07:30.249
Yeaaah!
Hey, good idea, Ralph!

07:30.249 --> 07:31.851
Come on Bentley, what do you say

07:31.851 --> 07:33.953
we go outside and have some fun?

07:33.953 --> 07:36.622
The fresh air
will do you boys good!

07:36.622 --> 07:39.692
All right,
if I have to.

07:39.692 --> 07:41.394
That's
the spirit, Bentley.

07:41.394 --> 07:44.730
We'll be buddies.
Just you and me.

07:45.364 --> 07:48.634
Aaaand... uh, your computer.

07:49.936 --> 07:52.138
Here comes a beauty, Bentley!

07:52.138 --> 07:53.773
A perfect pop up!

07:53.773 --> 07:56.142
Hey, it's all yours! Go for it!

07:57.143 --> 07:58.544
Isn't this a great fun, Bentley?

07:58.544 --> 08:00.079
Allowing
for human error

08:00.079 --> 08:02.782
and according to the figure
being presented to me now,

08:02.782 --> 08:04.317
the ball should hit...

08:04.317 --> 08:05.818
here!

08:06.619 --> 08:09.288
Bentley, Bentley
speak to me! Bentley!

08:11.090 --> 08:12.992
The pole strikes ground.

08:12.992 --> 08:14.393
Aaaah-ugh!

08:14.393 --> 08:17.597
Ugh! Uuuh-uh-uugh!

08:17.597 --> 08:19.665
Pop, pop, are you okay?

08:19.665 --> 08:23.469
What are you doing on the
ground? With that pole?!

08:23.469 --> 08:25.338
Ah, looking for worms.

08:25.338 --> 08:28.107
Gonna do a little fishing.

08:28.107 --> 08:30.142
You should
be more careful, pop.

08:30.142 --> 08:32.678
Someone your age could get hurt.

08:32.678 --> 08:35.515
Uhm, someone my age?! Ha!

08:35.515 --> 08:39.151
I'd love to show all those
young upstarts a thing or two.

08:39.151 --> 08:40.653
Now where was I?

08:40.653 --> 08:43.322
Sneer begins his run.

08:43.322 --> 08:46.292
He's really building
up momentum now!

08:46.292 --> 08:48.995
The crowd is cheering
like never before.

08:48.995 --> 08:50.963
The pole strikes ground,

08:50.963 --> 08:54.000
Sneer is up.. up.. up...

08:54.000 --> 08:55.268
Aaaaah...

08:55.268 --> 08:58.538
Uh-uhg-uhg-uuhg!

08:58.538 --> 09:02.441
Got to get the Bears
to cut down those trees.

09:04.810 --> 09:05.411
Gee Bentley, I thought you

09:05.411 --> 09:07.847
Gee Bentley, I thought
you had that ball for sure.

09:07.847 --> 09:10.850
You were right under it!
Oh well, that's OK.

09:10.850 --> 09:12.985
Tomorrow, we're
gonna play football.

09:12.985 --> 09:15.488
Yeah, footballs are
much easier to catch.

09:15.488 --> 09:17.823
And after that, you can help me

09:17.823 --> 09:19.859
practice for the Forest Games!

09:19.859 --> 09:21.527
Bert, enough!!

09:21.527 --> 09:25.231
I prefer that tomorrow
weren't like today!

09:25.231 --> 09:28.200
Huh?! W-w-what
does that mean?

09:28.200 --> 09:30.703
Today I tried
everything you wanted me to

09:30.703 --> 09:33.573
and what have I got
to show for it?

09:34.340 --> 09:36.943
Gee Bentley,
Bert was just trying to show you

09:36.943 --> 09:40.313
how much fun games
can be. He meant well.

09:40.313 --> 09:42.515
He made me feel unwell.

09:42.515 --> 09:44.884
I just want to sleep now, OK?

09:45.351 --> 09:48.220
Ok.. ok.
Goodnight Bentley.

09:48.220 --> 09:49.388
Goodnight.

09:52.725 --> 09:55.161
Hey Melissa,
what am I doing wrong?

09:55.161 --> 09:58.030
What have I got to do to
get through to that kid?

10:00.900 --> 10:03.869
Pig 2: I can't wait
until we find that Fountain.

10:03.869 --> 10:07.707
One sip and the boss
will be a new younger man!

10:07.707 --> 10:11.611
Pig 1: (giggles) And we'll
have ourselves that raise!

10:11.611 --> 10:13.546
Pig 2: So what
are we waiting for?

10:13.546 --> 10:15.514

If we come back without water
from the Fountain of Youth,

10:45.144 --> 10:48.814
the boss will be writing us
a euology instead of a check!

let me taste that.

Sluuuuurp!

my back does, I'd be broke.

13:08.087 --> 13:10.456

13:10.456 --> 13:13.692
uuuh.. an easier.. aaah.. way.

13:13.692 --> 13:16.428
Pig 2: Boss, boss,
we have it, we have it!

13:16.428 --> 13:20.199
Pig 3: The magical formula
from the Fountain of Youth.

13:20.199 --> 13:23.068
Pig 2: This will make you
100 years younger.

13:23.068 --> 13:26.605
Pig 1: We've seen it work sir,
with our very own eyes!

13:26.605 --> 13:28.574
Pig 2:
...and seeing is believing!

13:28.574 --> 13:31.277
Uhm.. isn't it, Sir?

13:31.277 --> 13:33.712
Pheeew! This
stuff tastes terrible!

13:33.712 --> 13:35.815
It must be good for me.

13:37.449 --> 13:40.886
Eh, strange taste, would
go well with jelly!

13:40.886 --> 13:45.457
Pig 2: My, my Sir,
you certainly look younger.

13:45.457 --> 13:48.427
Pig 3: And you feel
younger, don't you, Sir?

13:48.427 --> 13:50.830
Do I look
like I feel younger?

13:50.830 --> 13:53.332
Ohh yes Sir, yes Sir!

13:53.332 --> 13:55.601
No doubt about it, Sir!

13:55.601 --> 13:56.769
Then it works!

13:56.769 --> 13:58.671
Pig 2: It works, it works!

13:58.671 --> 14:01.407
Ohh, you're a boy wonder, Sir!

14:01.407 --> 14:03.242
Pig 1: The King Titan.

14:03.242 --> 14:04.743
I'll say, I am!
The Bear: Ugh?!

14:04.743 --> 14:08.180
Yahoo! Get my
equipment ready, boys!

14:08.714 --> 14:11.083
Tomorrow I'm going to
show the world

14:11.083 --> 14:12.785
the Cyril Sneer of old

14:12.785 --> 14:16.088
and new hot diggity yahoo,

14:16.088 --> 14:19.458
we're in the money! Hahaaa!
We're in the money!

14:21.193 --> 14:22.995
Dick Ermine:
Ladies and gentlemen,

14:22.995 --> 14:26.999
the first annual Evergreen
Forest Games are about to begin.

14:26.999 --> 14:30.269
I'm Dick Ermine, and my colour
commentator this afternoon

14:30.269 --> 14:32.171
is Melissa Raccoon.

14:32.171 --> 14:35.374
Thank you Dick, and
hello to everyone in the forest.

14:36.809 --> 14:38.043
Here are the rules.

14:38.043 --> 14:41.380
The competitor who accumulates
the most points over today's

14:41.380 --> 14:44.283
5 events will be
declared the winner.

14:44.283 --> 14:46.318
Say Bert,
where's Bentley?

14:46.318 --> 14:48.387
Will the entrants
in the first event

14:48.387 --> 14:50.356
now take their places?

14:50.356 --> 14:52.057
Wait a minute,
ladies and gentlemen,

14:52.057 --> 14:53.525
we have a last-minute entry.

14:56.061 --> 14:57.463
Cyril Sneer!

14:58.530 --> 15:00.466
Cyril Sneer?!

15:00.466 --> 15:02.635
Pop! You?!

15:02.635 --> 15:06.372
Me competing
against Cyril Sneer?!

15:07.806 --> 15:10.809
Aaah.. that Cup's already
got my name on it.

15:10.809 --> 15:13.178
Save your
breath, Raccoon.

15:13.178 --> 15:14.880
You're gonna need
it for the race!

15:14.880 --> 15:16.348
Where's that formula?

15:17.216 --> 15:18.751
Sluuurp!

15:18.751 --> 15:21.687
I feel like I could leave
a jack rabbit in the dust.

15:22.488 --> 15:23.923
On you mark...

15:24.323 --> 15:25.557
Get set...

15:25.557 --> 15:26.659
Go!!

15:30.195 --> 15:31.730
...and Bert Raccoon

15:31.730 --> 15:33.732
takes the first big step towards

15:33.732 --> 15:35.868
winning the Athletic cup.

15:35.868 --> 15:39.071
Aaaaah! Don't get
too excited, Raccoon!

15:39.071 --> 15:40.773
I was just warming up.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.074
Ladies and gentlemen,

15:42.074 --> 15:45.377
our next event - the hurdles.

16:00.292 --> 16:02.728
Ha-haaa! Ha-ha!
Now that's more like it!

16:02.728 --> 16:04.697
I'm feeling younger
by the minute.

16:04.697 --> 16:08.367
There's no question
who's won this event.

16:08.367 --> 16:10.135
Cyril Sneer's performance

16:10.135 --> 16:12.371
was nothing short of remarkable.

16:12.371 --> 16:15.274
This is a big
upset for Bert, Dick.

16:15.274 --> 16:19.411
He had his heart set on winning
all of these events so much.

16:20.045 --> 16:21.714
And as we
near the final turn,

16:21.714 --> 16:24.383
Bert Raccoon and Cyril Sneer
are neck-and-neck.

16:24.383 --> 16:26.919
♪ (dramatic music) ♪

16:26.919 --> 16:28.554
But wait...!

16:28.554 --> 16:31.290
... right behind
is Sophia Tutu!

16:31.290 --> 16:34.493
And it's Sophia Tutu
with a strong finish!

16:35.294 --> 16:37.663
But look, Bert Raccoon's
been hurt!

16:37.663 --> 16:40.799
Well, it doesn't look to me
like he's going to be able

16:40.799 --> 16:43.135
to take part in any of
the other events today.

16:43.135 --> 16:46.338
Ohh, these games
meant so much to Bert.

16:46.338 --> 16:49.174
How do you account for an
injury like that, Melissa?

16:49.174 --> 16:51.910
He didn't train
the way he planned to.

16:51.910 --> 16:55.514
He's been preoccupied with
something else lately.

17:00.519 --> 17:02.788
Ouch. Ah-eh!

17:02.788 --> 17:05.157
Oooh, I think
I pulled something.

17:05.157 --> 17:07.926
Yeah, a cheap stunt
to back out of the race!

17:07.926 --> 17:10.462
Well, it won't be as fun for me,
winning that cup

17:10.462 --> 17:12.131
without any competition,

17:12.131 --> 17:13.932
but it'll still be a pleasure!

17:15.300 --> 17:17.603
Without
competition, Mr Sneer?

17:17.603 --> 17:20.672
What?! Stay out
of my way, short stuff,

17:20.672 --> 17:22.341
or you'll be eating dust!

17:22.341 --> 17:24.276
We have a
last minute entrant

17:24.276 --> 17:27.346
in the final two events,
ladies and gentlemen,

17:27.346 --> 17:29.014
Bentley Raccoon.

17:29.848 --> 17:32.051
Pig 2: Do you see what I see?

17:32.051 --> 17:34.987
Bert Raccoon and the
little guy who looks...

17:34.987 --> 17:36.789
just like him.

17:36.789 --> 17:41.126
Pig 1: Oh, that means that
our discoveries a fake!

17:41.126 --> 17:43.996
Pig 2: Oh no!!

17:43.996 --> 17:45.664
What are we going to do?

17:45.664 --> 17:47.066
Bentley,

17:47.066 --> 17:50.469
will first be participating
in the long jump.

17:55.474 --> 18:00.045
Aaaand a very good
jump for Sophia Tutu.

18:00.045 --> 18:02.848
Pig 2: Uhm, Sir.. um...

18:02.848 --> 18:04.716
may we have a word with you?

18:07.186 --> 18:08.520
Pig 2: Uhm.. Sir?

18:11.523 --> 18:14.059
What a jump
for Cyril Sneer!

18:14.059 --> 18:17.830
Gee Bert, I can hardly
believe that's Cyril Sneer!

18:17.830 --> 18:20.065
Bentley will really have
to try his hardest

18:20.065 --> 18:21.333
to beat that jump.

18:22.734 --> 18:26.205
And now for
Bentley Raccoon.

18:29.408 --> 18:30.776
He did!

18:30.776 --> 18:31.777
He did it!

18:31.777 --> 18:35.347
Bentley Raccoon has
executed a record jump!

18:35.347 --> 18:37.116
Unbelievable!

18:37.116 --> 18:38.884
What?! Record jump?

18:38.884 --> 18:41.086
Phaaa! Beginner's luck!

18:41.086 --> 18:43.589
Bert, Bert,
did you see that jump?

18:43.589 --> 18:44.857
Yah!

18:44.857 --> 18:46.925
Hand over the
Fountain of Youth elixir!

My specialty is coming up!

18:49.228 --> 18:50.429
The pole vault!

18:50.429 --> 18:52.431
Pig 2: (chuckles) Sir,

18:52.431 --> 18:54.199
maybe this stuff isn't all

18:54.199 --> 18:56.869
that it's cracked up to be?
Nonsense!

18:56.869 --> 18:58.871
How can you tell me
that it isn't working

18:58.871 --> 19:01.140
when I'm one point away
from taking the cup.

19:02.441 --> 19:05.110
There, I feel I could
jump so high,

19:05.110 --> 19:07.880
I'll be the first tycoon
in outer space!

19:15.220 --> 19:17.256
Ugh! You
call that a jump?

19:17.256 --> 19:19.625
Now lift that bar!

19:19.625 --> 19:21.593
I want it higher!!

19:21.593 --> 19:23.896
Ugh-oh!
Higher, Sir?

19:23.896 --> 19:26.999
Higher!! Higher then
my bank's interest rates!!

19:26.999 --> 19:30.536
No, no, not 2 inches higher!

19:30.536 --> 19:32.137
Two feet!

19:32.471 --> 19:34.973
Well, I really don't know
what Cyril Sneer is doing...

19:36.441 --> 19:39.278
He's placed that bar at a height
that he can't possibly clear.

is putting on today...

cup will belong to Cyril Sneer!

20:51.250 --> 20:52.751
You learned it from Bert

and there's nobody better
at playing games.

21:00.692 --> 21:02.861
