Move it! Move it!

02:48.544 --> 02:51.046
- Hang on, Junior! Take it easy!
- Come on! Come on!

03:02.600 --> 03:04.268
Move it!

03:09.440 --> 03:11.901
Come on! Come on!

03:13.777 --> 03:14.945
Through here! Through here!

03:34.882 --> 03:36.467
Gotta cross this! Let's go!

03:50.898 --> 03:52.066
Let's go!

03:59.990 --> 04:04.328
Keep it moving!

04:08.749 --> 04:10.167
Move it!

04:16.298 --> 04:18.216
Come on!

04:30.187 --> 04:32.356
Come on, soldier!

05:12.896 --> 05:15.566
- Choppers!
- Quickly! Go!

05:45.512 --> 05:49.475
Let's go!

05:54.271 --> 05:56.106
Behind you!

06:06.200 --> 06:08.285
Come on! Get in! Get in!

06:09.286 --> 06:12.623
- Let's go! Let's get outta here!
- Go, go, go!

06:12.790 --> 06:14.291
Wait!

06:17.127 --> 06:19.630
- Get in!
- Oh, my God!

06:21.173 --> 06:24.760
Over here!

06:45.656 --> 06:47.241
Get up! Get up!

06:49.993 --> 06:52.413
Let's go! Let's go!
Get your ass up in the air!

06:52.579 --> 06:54.665
Get out the way, damn it!

06:55.499 --> 06:58.836
All right, we're ready! Let's go!
Move it! Move it!

07:33.996 --> 07:36.081
Come on! Keep going!

07:43.630 --> 07:45.048
Move it!

07:48.719 --> 07:51.054
- Hurry up, godammit!
- Give me your hand!

07:51.221 --> 07:53.390
Take off! Take off! Go! Go! Go!

08:08.739 --> 08:10.282
Move it!

08:33.931 --> 08:35.015
Aah!

08:37.100 --> 08:38.769
He won't try that shit again!

08:38.936 --> 08:40.938
Griffin, get him out of here!

08:43.607 --> 08:45.484
God...!

09:23.355 --> 09:26.900
<i>...American servicemen
missing in action. Bill?</i>

09:27.067 --> 09:28.360
<i>Thanks, Jane.</i>

09:28.527 --> 09:31.697
<i>Preparations for a high-/eve/ meeting
with the Vietnamese continue today</i>

09:31.863 --> 09:35.158
<i>as a senate delegation made ready
to leave for Ho Chi Minh City.</i>

09:35.325 --> 09:37.869
<i>The primary purpose of the talks
is to determine whether or not</i>

09:38.036 --> 09:42.332
<i>American servicemen are still being
held as prisoners of war in Vietnam.</i>

09:42.499 --> 09:46.003
<i>In recent months, American veterans'
organizations have increased demands</i>

09:46.169 --> 09:49.756
<i>for information regarding
some 2,500 American servicemen</i>

09:49.923 --> 09:52.342
<i>who did not return home
from the war in Vietnam.</i>

09:52.509 --> 09:56.847
<i>The fate of these Missing In Action
Americans still remains uncertain today.</i>

09:57.014 --> 10:00.309
<i>Reported sightings of foreign
prisoners being held in Vietnam</i>

10:00.475 --> 10:05.314
<i>have resulted in greater efforts to
resolve the MIA issue once and for all.</i>

10:05.480 --> 10:09.026
<i>Senator Maxwell Porter, head
of the US delegation to Vietnam,</i>

10:09.192 --> 10:11.612
<i>expressed guarded optimism
that talks would result</i>

10:11.778 --> 10:14.573
<i>in shedding some light
on this unresolved issue.</i>

10:14.740 --> 10:16.366
<i>But we're cautioned,
however, that progress</i>

10:16.533 --> 10:18.702
<i>would probably
be slow and painstaking.</i>

10:19.369 --> 10:22.372
<i>You give off bad vibes, Shocker!</i>

10:28.503 --> 10:32.883
<i>Spider-Man, we meet again!
Sooner than I expected!</i>

10:33.050 --> 10:35.052
<i>I love reunions!</i>

10:37.387 --> 10:39.222
<i>Here's one, Iceman!</i>

10:45.437 --> 10:48.023
<i>Looks like I'll have to settle
with the wall-crawler</i>

10:48.190 --> 10:49.983
<i>before I do anything else!</i>

10:50.150 --> 10:53.904
<i>And I know just how I'm going to do it!</i>

11:00.661 --> 11:03.747
<i>Leaving?
Was it something I said?</i>

11:03.914 --> 11:09.169
<i>Puny insect! My vibro-shock
power lets me vibrate out of any trap!</i>

11:09.336 --> 11:14.091
<i>The next reunion will be your last!</i>

11:58.051 --> 11:59.261
Over there!

12:02.889 --> 12:04.558
Listen to me!

12:10.480 --> 12:12.983
One of you for one of mine!

12:47.350 --> 12:52.439
<i>Shocker returns
with even more vibro-shock power!</i>

12:57.027 --> 12:59.237
<i>Spider friends...</i>

13:02.866 --> 13:04.326
<i>---Q0 for it!</i>

13:04.493 --> 13:07.621
<i>Let's visit a maximum-security prison!</i>

13:12.125 --> 13:14.628
<i>It's the Shocker! He's making a break!</i>

13:29.184 --> 13:34.231
<i>Spider-Man put me in that hole
and now I'm gonna get even!</i>

13:34.397 --> 13:37.567
<i>As you may recall,
he masterminded an escape of Americans</i>

13:37.734 --> 13:40.779
<i>from a Vietnamese prison camp and has
maintained that the camp in which</i>

13:40.946 --> 13:43.907
<i>he was held was not
the only one in Vietnam.</i>

13:44.074 --> 13:46.993
<i>Though he has never been able
to offer any proof of his allegations,</i>

13:47.160 --> 13:50.330
<i>Braddock has been one of the most
outspoken proponents of the theory</i>

13:50.497 --> 13:53.917
<i>that American prisoners are
still being held in Vietnam today.</i>

13:54.084 --> 13:56.419
<i>Braddock has, however,
refused all recent offers</i>

13:56.586 --> 13:59.589
<i>to speak to servicemen 's organizations
on the subject of MIAs</i>

13:59.756 --> 14:02.092
<i>and has completely withdrawn
from any public discussion</i>

14:02.259 --> 14:03.885
<i>of the MIA controversy.</i>

14:04.052 --> 14:06.763
<i>The American delegation had hoped
that Braddock's presence at the talks</i>

14:06.930 --> 14:09.266
<i>would increase their ability
to negotiate.</i>

14:12.769 --> 14:14.646
This is Braddock.

14:17.107 --> 14:18.859
I'll go.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.946
The Vietnamese government
will never buy it.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.449
The people in these photos
could be damn near anybody.

14:26.616 --> 14:28.827
Including American MIAs.

14:28.994 --> 14:33.582
Now, listen, even our own experts agree
that that's only a 50-50 chance.

14:33.748 --> 14:36.209
You can imagine
what their people are gonna say.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.295
We're gonna need something
a hell of a lot stronger than that

14:38.461 --> 14:40.547
if we're gonna make
an impression on 'em.

14:40.714 --> 14:44.801
Isn't that why Colonel Braddock
is along? As irrefutable evidence?

14:44.968 --> 14:47.137
Some piece of irrefutable evidence.

14:47.304 --> 14:49.306
Just look at the way
the son of a bitch is dressed.

14:49.472 --> 14:51.683
Who am I trying to impress, Senator?

15:32.682 --> 15:35.018
Senator Porter, I am General Tran.

15:35.185 --> 15:37.145
Welcome to the
People's Republic of Vietnam.

15:37.312 --> 15:38.855
It's a pleasure, General.

15:39.022 --> 15:42.025
I'd like to introduce you to
Ann Fitzgerald, State Department.

15:42.192 --> 15:44.027
- Miss Fitzgerald, welcome.
- Thank you.

15:44.194 --> 15:45.654
Colonel James Braddock.

15:47.364 --> 15:50.367
Ah, Colonel Braddock,
I've heard much about you.

15:50.533 --> 15:53.078
Welcome to the
People's Republic of Vietnam.

15:58.166 --> 15:59.709
Colonel!

16:08.593 --> 16:09.886
Excuse me.

16:10.845 --> 16:13.056
You're a goddamn embarrassment,
Braddock.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.600
That's why I'm here, Senator.

16:18.061 --> 16:22.023
Something I've been wondering.
What made you change your mind?

16:22.190 --> 16:24.484
I mean, we must've asked you 20 times.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.236
I've got my reasons.

17:22.125 --> 17:24.210
What's wrong?

17:25.753 --> 17:27.547
Nothing's wrong.

18:08.671 --> 18:11.174
So nice to have you with us.

18:11.341 --> 18:15.553
Senator Porter, we all know that
Colonel Braddock was brought here

18:15.720 --> 18:18.848
only in an attempt
to embarrass my government.

18:19.015 --> 18:20.350
That's not true, General.

18:20.517 --> 18:22.977
But I believe that once
the real reason

18:23.144 --> 18:26.481
for his extended imprisonment
is revealed,

18:26.648 --> 18:29.234
the world will take
quite a different view of him.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.237
Miss Fitzgerald.

18:35.532 --> 18:37.534
Colonel Braddock...

18:50.588 --> 18:52.340
- General!
- Can we get through here?

18:52.507 --> 18:55.176
Excuse me, General, sir...

19:31.421 --> 19:35.800
These people were eyewitnesses
to some of the war crimes

19:35.967 --> 19:39.846
committed by Colonel Braddock
against the people of Vietnam.

19:46.728 --> 19:51.024
Innocent women, children
and old men were his victims.

19:55.403 --> 19:59.282
You have their sworn statements
in front of you.

21:05.265 --> 21:07.141
What did he say?

21:07.308 --> 21:09.769
He said he understands and it's OK.

21:13.982 --> 21:17.485
Colonel Braddock...
is it not true that during the war

21:17.652 --> 21:21.489
there was a price on your head
of 5,000 American dollars?

21:24.367 --> 21:26.452
It was more like $20,000.

21:26.869 --> 21:28.079
What?

21:28.871 --> 21:31.332
Why don't you tell us
why there was a price on my head?

21:31.499 --> 21:33.751
For your war crimes, of course.

21:36.087 --> 21:39.799
For killing assholes like you.

21:39.966 --> 21:41.759
Colonel!

21:45.888 --> 21:48.349
The atrocities,
as documented in front of you,

21:48.516 --> 21:51.811
were the real reasons
why Colonel Braddock was held here!

21:51.978 --> 21:56.232
He was not a prisoner of war,
but a common criminal!

22:21.591 --> 22:22.884
Been

22:27.430 --> 22:28.723
Thanks.

22:37.982 --> 22:40.109
I see you've come up in the world.

22:44.238 --> 22:46.574
You got out
of this country once, Colonel.

22:47.825 --> 22:51.871
You might not be so lucky this time.

22:58.586 --> 23:02.757
Tran is up in arms about
your behavior this afternoon.

23:05.301 --> 23:08.554
Porter called Washington
trying to get you recalled.

23:10.223 --> 23:12.975
And the President is outraged...
publicly.

23:14.143 --> 23:17.355
Ah, Miss Fitzgerald,
you look lovely tonight.

23:17.522 --> 23:20.983
Uh, Colonel Braddock, there is a
question I've been wanting to ask you.

23:21.150 --> 23:24.487
Is it true that you let
ten of your men die in prison

23:24.654 --> 23:29.200
all because you alone refused
to admit your war crimes?

23:35.039 --> 23:39.335
You are the most undiplomatic man
I have ever met.

23:41.337 --> 23:45.091
I'm not running for office. Besides,
you don't know anything about me.

23:45.258 --> 23:48.094
Oh. Well, let's see.

23:48.261 --> 23:50.555
James Thomas Braddock, 38 years old.

23:50.721 --> 23:53.474
Colonel in the Army Special Forces.
Retired.

23:53.641 --> 23:54.767
Prisoner of war for eight months.

23:54.934 --> 23:58.104
Missing in action for seven years,
escaping last year.

23:58.271 --> 24:00.606
And you are now in Saigon
at the request of the President

24:00.773 --> 24:03.484
to see if there are
any more Braddocks in Vietnam.

24:06.737 --> 24:10.074
Like I said,
you don't know anything about me.

24:15.455 --> 24:16.998
How about a nightcap?

24:21.377 --> 24:23.963
Yeah, sure.
See you in a few minutes, huh?

25:14.889 --> 25:18.768
The champagne's getting warm.

25:18.935 --> 25:20.436
Oh, yeah.

25:25.358 --> 25:27.610
Been quite a day.

25:27.777 --> 25:30.821
Yeah. It should be quite a night, too.

25:32.782 --> 25:34.909
Now, look, Braddock, just because...

25:35.076 --> 25:39.455
- Just what do you think you're doing?
- What does it look like?

25:45.753 --> 25:48.047
Would you mind?
I'm a little on the shy side.

25:49.674 --> 25:51.676
I don't believe this.

25:52.760 --> 25:56.055
Look, Braddock, I invited you up here
for a nightcap, not...

26:00.226 --> 26:01.269
Jim!

26:07.400 --> 26:09.443
What the hell is this?

26:09.610 --> 26:13.906
I'm gonna take a look around Saigon.
See how it's changed since the war.

26:14.073 --> 26:17.785
We are not supposed to leave
the hotel without an escort.

26:17.952 --> 26:20.162
Jim, do you hear me?

26:20.329 --> 26:22.206
I won't be gone long.

26:22.373 --> 26:24.709
I'm supposed to be keeping you
out of trouble.

26:28.337 --> 26:31.173
Shit.

26:41.183 --> 26:42.977
Braddock, don't.

26:49.275 --> 26:51.611
How are you gonna
get out of here, anyway?

26:55.698 --> 26:56.866
<i>FIY-</i>

27:00.786 --> 27:02.246
Bastard.

32:42.962 --> 32:44.880
Keep your eyes shut...

32:46.882 --> 32:48.968
...and listen very carefully.

32:54.098 --> 32:56.058
The answer you give me...

32:56.976 --> 32:59.728
...will decide whether you live or die.

32:59.895 --> 33:01.981
And I'll know if you're lying

33:04.566 --> 33:10.197
Now, where are the American MIAs?

33:10.364 --> 33:12.574
I don't know.

33:12.741 --> 33:13.993
Don't do it!

33:14.910 --> 33:16.912
There is a camp.

33:17.079 --> 33:19.581
- Delta region.
- Where?

33:21.500 --> 33:24.211
Dong Ha. Dong Ha.

33:24.920 --> 33:27.506
Eight kilometers from the coast.

33:35.931 --> 33:38.267
No, don't! Don't! Spare me!

33:38.434 --> 33:40.811
I gave you the information. I gave it.

33:40.978 --> 33:43.105
That's all I know. Don't...

33:59.955 --> 34:01.415
If you move...

34:02.124 --> 34:03.751
...I'll kill you.

40:38.186 --> 40:41.523
I suppose he's been here
with you all night?

40:43.024 --> 40:45.068
That's right.

40:46.069 --> 40:48.196
How very convenient.

40:49.781 --> 40:51.450
Yes, isn't it?

40:51.616 --> 40:53.535
You...

40:54.453 --> 40:55.871
You leave tomorrow...

40:56.788 --> 40:58.498
...or you'll not leave at all.

41:16.558 --> 41:18.393
I wish you didn't have to go.

41:19.561 --> 41:21.271
Nothing I can do here.

41:22.731 --> 41:24.608
Jim, why Bangkok?

41:26.234 --> 41:27.903
I have to look up a friend.

41:34.910 --> 41:36.745
An old army buddy.

41:48.215 --> 41:49.925
Be careful.

42:10.195 --> 42:15.992
<i>Flight 320 from Ho Chi
Minh City, arriving at Gate Six.</i>

42:24.292 --> 42:28.213
<i>Flight 210 to Singapore
now boarding at Gate Three.</i>

44:05.560 --> 44:07.937
Do you need a nice girl, sir?
It's ten dollars.

44:08.104 --> 44:10.231
It's awfully cheap.

44:58.279 --> 45:00.949
- Buy me a drink, handsome?
- Not tonight.

45:03.952 --> 45:05.078
Do you speak English?

45:06.162 --> 45:07.789
You bet.

45:07.956 --> 45:11.668
- I'm looking for a friend.
- Isn't everybody?

45:20.176 --> 45:22.429
He must be a good friend.

45:22.971 --> 45:25.807
His name's Tucker. Jack Tucker.

45:36.234 --> 45:39.988
I think... maybe I have heard of him.

45:40.155 --> 45:44.242
- Where can I find him?
- What do you want him for?

45:47.662 --> 45:49.497
Wrong answer.

45:50.373 --> 45:53.752
He's probably at Madame Pearl's
whorehouse down the road.

45:55.837 --> 45:57.255
Thanks.

45:59.007 --> 46:00.925
Come back soon.

46:18.109 --> 46:20.195
Taxi! Taxi!

46:32.373 --> 46:34.375
Patpong Road.

47:27.345 --> 47:29.264
Sam Song Hotel.

47:49.784 --> 47:53.663
<i>J' She sits alone waiting for suggestions</i>

47:53.830 --> 47:57.125
<i>J' He's so nervous,
avoiding all the questions</i>

47:57.292 --> 47:59.711
<i>J' His lips are dry...</i>

47:59.878 --> 48:02.922
- Where's Madame Pearl?
- She's over there.

48:04.674 --> 48:08.052
<i>J' If you want my body
and you think I'm sexy</i>

48:08.219 --> 48:11.264
<i>J' Come on, honey, let it show</i>

48:16.895 --> 48:19.188
I'm looking for Jack Tucker.
Is he around?

48:19.355 --> 48:21.149
He'll be here... in a moment.

48:25.653 --> 48:27.989
Thanks.

48:35.413 --> 48:37.206
How's it going, Tuck?

48:37.832 --> 48:39.125
Braddock.

48:39.292 --> 48:42.879
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I wanna rent your boat.

48:44.047 --> 48:46.299
Oh, shit. We'd better talk later.

48:50.637 --> 48:52.013
It's important. How much?

48:52.180 --> 48:53.890
Five grand.

48:55.183 --> 48:57.685
- Four grand!
- I didn't hear ya!

48:58.686 --> 48:59.854
Two!

49:02.190 --> 49:04.025
- Did you say one thousand?
- No.

49:07.904 --> 49:10.281
Yeah, a thousand bucks.

49:10.448 --> 49:12.200
That's what I thought you said.
Come on.

49:12.367 --> 49:15.954
What the hell do you need
my boat for, anyway?

49:16.621 --> 49:19.540
We're going back to Nam
to rescue some MIAs.

49:19.707 --> 49:24.128
Oh, shit, Braddock. You're crazy.

49:24.295 --> 49:26.798
You said "we."
You said "we're going back."

49:26.965 --> 49:29.801
You owe me, Tuck. I need your help.

49:33.262 --> 49:34.806
Yeah, I owe you.

49:34.973 --> 49:37.058
More than once.

49:40.853 --> 49:43.982
All right, you bastard.
I'll take you in.

49:44.148 --> 49:46.567
But I'm not going ashore.

49:46.734 --> 49:47.860
OK?

49:49.153 --> 49:50.405
OK.

50:18.141 --> 50:19.976
Getting in is no problem.

50:20.143 --> 50:23.479
I've been smuggling cigarettes
and booze for years.

50:23.646 --> 50:27.775
My new Southern Belle's one of the
fastest boats in the water around here.

50:30.111 --> 50:31.654
There she is.

50:35.867 --> 50:37.744
What the hell is that?

50:39.203 --> 50:43.875
Like my daddy always said,
don't believe everything you see.

50:55.636 --> 50:57.722
Discourages pirates.

51:01.976 --> 51:04.187
I'll show you something back here.

51:13.112 --> 51:17.241
They're Detroit diesels.
Turbocharged, 650 horsepower.

51:17.408 --> 51:20.161
We can hit 21 knots if we have to.

51:31.839 --> 51:37.345
M-16s, grenades, C-4, LAW.

51:37.512 --> 51:39.597
You're playing for keeps.

51:40.681 --> 51:43.351
What the hell do you need
an assault raft for?

51:43.518 --> 51:46.771
The camp's in the delta.
A raft is the easiest way in.

51:46.938 --> 51:50.024
How come you never mention
getting out?

51:50.191 --> 51:54.195
If we can hit the camp without raising
an alarm, we'll go back the way we came.

51:54.362 --> 51:57.615
- That's nice. And if not?
- We'll think of something.

51:58.199 --> 52:01.202
Great. Look, you wanna do me a favor?

52:01.369 --> 52:03.037
Next time I ask you something
about the mission,

52:03.204 --> 52:05.873
you don't tell me nothing, OK?
I'd rather not know.

52:06.040 --> 52:07.875
- There is something else.
- What?

52:08.042 --> 52:10.461
We could use a long-range chopper
as a backup.

52:10.628 --> 52:13.005
Now how in hell are we supposed
to manage that?

52:14.215 --> 52:15.800
We'll think of something.

52:17.885 --> 52:20.721
Gentlemen,
I can help you with everything,

52:20.888 --> 52:23.224
even the M-16s, but not the raft.

52:23.391 --> 52:25.351
Bullshit, Carlos.
We both know you got one.

52:25.518 --> 52:29.856
Got one? Sure, I got one.
I got the only one in all Thailand.

52:30.022 --> 52:31.858
But have you got the money?
That's the question.

52:32.024 --> 52:34.527
Let's see the sucker first,
then we'll talk money.

52:35.611 --> 52:37.655
There she is. Yang!

52:42.285 --> 52:43.911
Quite a unique weapon, eh?

52:45.580 --> 52:50.376
She can run 60 miles an hour,
and, with her mufflers on,

52:50.543 --> 52:52.670
no one can hear you coming.

52:52.837 --> 52:56.215
Yeah, too bad a single bullet'll
put her out of commission.

52:56.382 --> 52:58.092
Yang.

53:11.397 --> 53:12.940
It's Kevlar.

53:13.107 --> 53:15.067
Very expensive.

53:15.234 --> 53:18.446
Same material your bulletproof vests
are made out of.

53:18.613 --> 53:22.200
It will stop anything,
short of a grenade.

53:23.117 --> 53:24.952
How much?

53:25.119 --> 53:29.081
Twenty thousand American dollars...
for the raft.

53:29.248 --> 53:31.876
The rifles and ammunition...

53:32.043 --> 53:33.794
...I throw in, free.

53:41.886 --> 53:43.638
Five.

53:45.181 --> 53:46.557
Don't be ridiculous.

53:46.724 --> 53:49.810
There is nothing like her
in all of Southeast Asia.

53:54.732 --> 53:57.193
- Seven.
- Seventeen!

54:06.410 --> 54:08.829
Fifteen. No less.

54:18.256 --> 54:19.632
Ten.

54:23.219 --> 54:25.012
Deal.

54:46.701 --> 54:52.290
So, if I get this helicopter of yours,

54:52.456 --> 54:54.166
are you willing to pay?

54:54.333 --> 54:56.669
I didn't figure it was free.

54:57.670 --> 55:03.217
- OK, then. What about the marking? US?
- It doesn't matter.

55:04.051 --> 55:07.847
Just make sure I can count on the pilot.

55:09.056 --> 55:10.766
Look around, my friend.

55:10.933 --> 55:16.647
In this place, you can count on
people doing anything for money.

59:01.455 --> 59:03.958
Braddock! Hey, hop in!

59:04.124 --> 59:06.001
Come on, we're leaving early.

59:06.710 --> 59:08.295
Get dressed.

59:08.587 --> 59:11.590
AW... Shit.

01:00:42.556 --> 01:00:44.350
Mike, cast off!

01:05:16.288 --> 01:05:18.498
You shouldn't have hurt
those people in Bangkok.

01:05:18.665 --> 01:05:21.752
Fortunes of war.

01:05:21.919 --> 01:05:23.503
Yeah.

01:05:30.177 --> 01:05:32.220
Fortunes of war.

01:05:48.028 --> 01:05:50.530
Well, there she is... Vietnam.

01:05:50.697 --> 01:05:52.699
Pearl of the Orient.

01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:10.342
If I'm not back in 12 hours,
get the hell outta here.

01:06:11.468 --> 01:06:13.553
You're crazy, Braddock.

01:06:16.181 --> 01:06:17.140
Maybe.

01:06:17.307 --> 01:06:21.061
What happens if you have to fight
and navigate at the same time?

01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:23.897
I'll figure something out.

01:06:25.565 --> 01:06:28.902
You already have. You son of a bitch!

01:06:29.069 --> 01:06:32.364
Goddammit! You knew there was no way
in hell I'd let you go in there alone

01:06:32.531 --> 01:06:34.449
once we got here, didn't you?

01:06:35.158 --> 01:06:36.743
Let's get one thing straight!

01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:40.372
I'm only here to operate the damn raft!
That's it. Period!

01:06:40.539 --> 01:06:43.500
I'm not getting outta
the goddamn thing for any reason!

01:06:44.334 --> 01:06:45.752
Give us 14 hours!

01:06:47.421 --> 01:06:49.840
If I don't make it back,
the <i>Belle 's</i> yours.

01:07:27.461 --> 01:07:29.796
Come on, Tuck.

01:07:36.303 --> 01:07:39.806
No. You promised me
I wouldn't have to get off the raft.

01:07:43.268 --> 01:07:46.271
What do we need that for, anyway?
We're coming back on the raft.

01:07:46.438 --> 01:07:51.318
If we're lucky. If not, I don't think
our guys are gonna be in much condition

01:07:51.485 --> 01:07:53.445
to swim out to the boat.

01:08:41.201 --> 01:08:42.202
Tuck.

01:10:44.741 --> 01:10:47.327
Aah!

01:11:18.483 --> 01:11:19.609
Aah!

01:11:21.528 --> 01:11:24.030
Sorry. Won't happen again.

01:11:26.449 --> 01:11:30.328
- Do we run or fight?
- We don't have a choice now.

01:12:21.588 --> 01:12:24.632
The camp is about one klick
north of here.

01:12:24.799 --> 01:12:27.052
I'll go the rest of the way on foot.

01:12:29.137 --> 01:12:30.263
Thanks for coming this far.

01:12:30.430 --> 01:12:33.433
- Did I have a choice?
- Yeah, you did.

01:12:36.436 --> 01:12:38.563
Watch your ass!

01:22:38.162 --> 01:22:41.290
Sergeant Dinh, Black Panther Rangers.

01:22:44.543 --> 01:22:48.506
- You are after the Americans?
- Yeah. Where are they?

01:22:48.673 --> 01:22:52.551
They moved less than three hours ago,
somewhere further inland.

01:22:52.718 --> 01:22:54.303
Do you know which road they took?

01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:57.890
There is only one road
that connects with Highway One.

01:22:58.057 --> 01:23:00.184
It follows the river all the way.

01:23:00.893 --> 01:23:03.396
- You are going after them?
- Yeah.

01:23:13.364 --> 01:23:15.241
Thank you. Thank you.

01:23:45.646 --> 01:23:47.106
Tuck!

01:23:48.649 --> 01:23:50.776
- Tuck!
- Braddock?

01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:57.366
- Where's our people?
- They've been moved.

01:23:57.533 --> 01:23:59.785
- Shit!
- Let's go!

01:25:14.610 --> 01:25:15.653
There it is!

01:26:27.683 --> 01:26:28.767
Aah!

01:27:49.848 --> 01:27:50.849
Braddock?

01:27:51.684 --> 01:27:53.102
Is it safe?

01:28:23.716 --> 01:28:25.759
Holy Christ.

01:28:40.524 --> 01:28:42.401
You guys are going home.

01:28:45.404 --> 01:28:48.824
We're going home?

01:28:49.408 --> 01:28:51.076
Damn right!

01:28:51.910 --> 01:28:52.870
Give me your hand.

01:28:53.037 --> 01:28:55.164
We're going home!

01:28:59.918 --> 01:29:01.253
Come on!

01:29:02.921 --> 01:29:04.381
Get to the Jeep!

01:29:08.218 --> 01:29:09.803
Get in! Come on!

01:29:10.596 --> 01:29:12.139
Get in!

01:29:12.306 --> 01:29:13.724
OK, Braddock!

01:29:57.643 --> 01:30:00.270
- How far to the coast?
- About six klicks.

01:30:01.271 --> 01:30:03.107
Pray the boat's still there.

01:30:37.391 --> 01:30:39.518
Take 'em to the river! I'll catch up.

01:30:39.685 --> 01:30:41.019
Out you 90-

01:30:41.854 --> 01:30:43.272
Keep it goin'!

01:30:45.274 --> 01:30:47.025
Keep it goin'!

01:31:34.323 --> 01:31:35.991
Two klicks to the coast.
Can you make it?

01:31:36.158 --> 01:31:37.159
We'll make it.

01:32:11.610 --> 01:32:13.737
Come on!

01:32:13.904 --> 01:32:15.322
Come on! Come on!

01:32:17.074 --> 01:32:19.368
Come on! Move it!

01:32:20.744 --> 01:32:22.371
Come on! The boat!

01:32:22.538 --> 01:32:23.914
Keep moving there! Keep goin' now!

01:32:28.710 --> 01:32:30.629
Keep moving! Come on!

01:32:56.655 --> 01:32:57.656
Come on!

01:33:19.595 --> 01:33:21.054
Come on!

01:33:27.269 --> 01:33:29.187
Patrol boat!

01:33:47.205 --> 01:33:49.875
Get back! Go back to the shore!

01:34:08.644 --> 01:34:10.562
I'll see you in hell!

01:34:11.730 --> 01:34:12.814
Tuck!

01:34:19.404 --> 01:34:20.572
Take it down!

01:34:49.434 --> 01:34:50.435
Aah!

01:35:22.050 --> 01:35:23.927
Hurry up!

01:36:45.133 --> 01:36:48.303
- Where to?
- Saigon.

01:36:48.470 --> 01:36:50.222
Oh, shit!

01:36:50.388 --> 01:36:52.349
If I knew it would be like this,

01:36:52.516 --> 01:36:54.893
I wouldn't rent you the helicopter
for a million bucks!

01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:09.491
My government is extremely gratified

01:37:09.658 --> 01:37:14.830
to be able to put this issue to rest,
once and for all.

01:37:55.453 --> 01:37:57.247
In conclusion, then...

01:37:59.583 --> 01:38:01.710
...we categorically deny...

01:38:05.630 --> 01:38:10.635
...that there are any living MIAs
in the People's Republic of Vietnam.

01:41:35.882 --> 01:41:36.716
