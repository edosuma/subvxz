02:27.850 --> 02:28.931
Babe.

02:30.050 --> 02:31.030
We there?

02:31.130 --> 02:33.781
No, sorry. Would you give her
a call? We're gonna be late.

02:35.970 --> 02:37.893
Got a bit lost to be honest.

02:39.770 --> 02:42.250
- There's no signal.
- No signal at all?

02:43.290 --> 02:45.133
Welcome to Scotland.

02:46.010 --> 02:48.861
- You not excited about this?
- No, this is great.

02:49.650 --> 02:51.971
If this place can be ours
at this price...

02:53.650 --> 02:55.644
it'd be amazing.

02:59.210 --> 03:01.417
- It's a lovely view.
- It's gorgeous.

03:01.610 --> 03:04.171
- Aye, it's gorgeous.
- It's gorgeous.

03:04.330 --> 03:06.731
Och, I cannae believe it.
It's beautiful.

03:07.770 --> 03:09.499
Scotland, here we come.

03:53.410 --> 03:55.412
- Mrs. Chapman.
- Yes, hello.

03:55.570 --> 03:58.255
Hello. I'm Flo. Flo Douglas
from Armstrong and Graham.

03:58.410 --> 03:59.980
So lovely to meet you. I'm Sarah.

04:00.130 --> 04:01.336
This is my husband, Ed.

04:01.490 --> 04:04.300
- Hello.
- Hello. Welcome to Castle Farm.

04:04.450 --> 04:08.338
Thank you, I'm sorry we're late,
I think we took a wrong turn somewhere.

04:08.490 --> 04:10.731
If you're not familiar
with the lay of the land

04:10.890 --> 04:12.972
it's easy to run into trouble
around here

04:13.130 --> 04:15.656
and your mobile phones
will be of no use.

04:15.810 --> 04:17.892
They're still a thing of the future.

04:18.050 --> 04:20.178
You won't be able to survive out here.

04:20.370 --> 04:21.656
I can do without my phone.

04:21.810 --> 04:24.096
I don't think so.
It's glued to her hand.

04:25.250 --> 04:28.459
- Shall we look at the property?
- Yes, please.

04:32.810 --> 04:36.610
So, the main house and the outbuildings

04:36.770 --> 04:41.132
date back to the 19th century
but parish records show

04:41.290 --> 04:44.055
that there's been a settlement
of one kind or another

04:44.210 --> 04:48.978
on this spot since the 1300s
so it comes with a lot of history.

04:49.130 --> 04:50.541
Was there really a castle here?

04:50.730 --> 04:51.970
It was Peel House.

04:52.130 --> 04:55.577
Not really a castle,
more a fortification.

04:55.730 --> 04:58.176
It was the site of a ferocious battle

04:58.330 --> 05:00.651
between the Scots
and the English at one point.

05:00.810 --> 05:02.778
Who won?

05:02.930 --> 05:04.853
That depends on who you talk to.

05:16.210 --> 05:21.137
So. There's two reception
rooms off the hallway here,

05:21.290 --> 05:23.861
a kitchen to the rear plus a cold store.

05:24.010 --> 05:27.457
Upstairs, there's three
double bedrooms, one en suite,

05:27.610 --> 05:29.339
one single and a bathroom.

05:29.490 --> 05:33.415
And there's 1.5 acres, I believe.

05:33.610 --> 05:35.180
Ed, look at this.

05:38.290 --> 05:40.213
Could have some cozy
dinner parties in here.

05:40.410 --> 05:42.669
Do you know many people in the area?

05:42.789 --> 05:44.632
Not a soul.

05:45.410 --> 05:47.731
Oh, not to worry, you'll soon meet folk.

05:49.370 --> 05:51.372
Scotland's a very friendly country.

06:03.850 --> 06:06.456
- Sweet, aren't they?
- Yeah.

06:07.010 --> 06:10.901
Has there been a structural
survey on this place recently?

06:11.050 --> 06:14.020
Not that I know of, but I'm sure
everything's tickety boo.

06:14.170 --> 06:17.333
These old houses were built to last.

06:17.530 --> 06:19.339
God, look at these views.

06:30.930 --> 06:33.900
So what happened
with the previous owner?

06:34.050 --> 06:36.974
Oh, Mr. Nixon.
He, um... He ran into bother

06:37.170 --> 06:40.060
some years ago now.
He borrowed money from the bank

06:40.210 --> 06:41.939
to keep the farm going,
couldn't pay it back.

06:42.090 --> 06:45.412
Now it's owned by some
finance company in the south.

06:45.570 --> 06:50.319
All that's left is the house,
the outbuildings and the field out back.

06:50.450 --> 06:53.699
- Did they have to evict him?
- Oh, no, he was here until the end.

06:53.850 --> 06:55.295
Put up quite a fight, too.

06:55.450 --> 06:57.612
Been in his family
for three generations.

06:57.770 --> 07:00.171
He didn't have any family
to pass it on to?

07:00.330 --> 07:02.856
Yes, he had a number of sons...

07:03.890 --> 07:06.575
Some are still in the valley,
one's off fighting in the war,

07:06.730 --> 07:09.131
but when old Willy died,

07:09.330 --> 07:11.731
the house became
the property of the bank.

07:13.290 --> 07:15.292
So did he die in the house?

07:16.970 --> 07:19.211
- He did, yes.
- That's a shame.

07:20.210 --> 07:23.737
Yes, it was...
It was very emotional actually.

07:30.970 --> 07:32.415
Has there been much interest?

07:32.570 --> 07:34.732
Well, there's a shortage
of property in the area

07:34.890 --> 07:37.291
so there's always a lot of
interest from the locals.

07:37.450 --> 07:38.861
And have there been any offers?

07:39.010 --> 07:44.531
Oh, yes, yes, there have been offers,
but nothing realistic, shall we say.

07:44.690 --> 07:47.660
I guess a lot of people are put
off by the state of the place.

07:48.770 --> 07:51.979
There's a lot of work that needs
doing before it's livable.

07:52.130 --> 07:54.132
It's at a state of disarray,
that's true.

07:54.330 --> 07:57.614
But for the local people it's more
the price that's the problem.

07:57.770 --> 08:01.454
For what there is it's amazing,
I mean it's quite reasonable.

08:01.610 --> 08:03.738
By city standards perhaps,

08:03.890 --> 08:07.736
but for the local market
it's, um, too much.

08:09.010 --> 08:10.739
So it's ours for the taking then.

08:12.090 --> 08:13.137
Hmm.

08:18.530 --> 08:21.340
It's exactly the kind of project
you've talked about for years.

08:21.490 --> 08:24.778
Yeah, in Suffolk or Cornwall.

08:25.930 --> 08:28.012
Can't afford a place
in Suffolk or Cornwall.

08:28.810 --> 08:32.371
- This place is so cheap.
- That's because it's a wreck.

08:32.530 --> 08:34.611
Nothing in this place works.

08:34.770 --> 08:35.770
Aww.

08:36.730 --> 08:38.494
You can make it work.

08:38.970 --> 08:41.416
What will you be doing
while I'm making it work?

08:41.570 --> 08:43.417
I'll be helping.

08:44.770 --> 08:47.979
What? Do you think I'm really
useless at this stuff?

08:48.130 --> 08:50.974
That's because you are
useless at this stuff.

08:52.650 --> 08:54.414
OK, I am useless at this stuff

08:54.570 --> 08:57.050
but if you teach me, with a
little patience, I could learn.

08:58.930 --> 09:00.773
Look at those outbuildings.

09:00.930 --> 09:02.876
Imagine what we could do with them.

09:03.010 --> 09:04.614
They'd make perfect holiday lets.

09:04.770 --> 09:08.459
It's gonna take at least 18 months
before this place is fit to live in.

09:08.610 --> 09:11.853
Yeah, 18 months of
you being your own boss.

09:12.610 --> 09:15.693
Taking things at your own pace
and doing them how you want.

09:15.850 --> 09:18.012
Yeah, in Scotland,
where the weather is shit,

09:18.210 --> 09:20.816
the food is shit, the football is shit.

09:20.970 --> 09:22.859
- So?
- And judging by this place,

09:23.010 --> 09:24.455
the houses are shit.

09:28.370 --> 09:30.532
OK, so,

09:30.690 --> 09:34.172
do you want to go to work
on Monday, bowing to Fletcher

09:34.330 --> 09:36.936
and keep doing what you've been
doing for the rest of your life?

09:38.890 --> 09:43.179
- It's not what you want, is it?
- You know it's not.

09:45.250 --> 09:46.536
So?

09:47.730 --> 09:49.573
Let's sell up and move here.

09:51.850 --> 09:55.059
Come on, baby, let's have an adventure.

09:58.530 --> 10:01.101
- I hate you.
- I know.

10:41.970 --> 10:43.017
Ta-dah!

11:20.810 --> 11:24.019
Ed, I've wired a plug.

11:24.530 --> 11:26.658
And the crowd goes wild.

11:35.090 --> 11:38.572
Is that you? Sarah?

11:39.250 --> 11:41.537
- Sorry!
- For fuck's sake.

11:47.650 --> 11:49.811
Is there anything I can do to help?

11:49.970 --> 11:52.053
Yeah, stay away from the DIY manual.

11:52.210 --> 11:54.019
- Sorry.
- Hmm.

12:14.330 --> 12:17.174
- Jesus!
- You alright?

12:17.330 --> 12:20.857
Oh, gosh, you gave me a fright.
We have a visitor.

12:21.010 --> 12:24.093
- Hello, mate.
- Do you want a biscuit?

12:31.250 --> 12:32.854
He was in a bit of a hurry
to get somewhere.

12:33.010 --> 12:34.136
Yeah.

12:34.290 --> 12:36.019
Probably going home to shag his sister.

12:36.170 --> 12:37.660
- Ed!
- What?

12:37.810 --> 12:39.812
You know what these
country folk are like.

12:39.970 --> 12:42.450
If it isn't his mother
it'll be his sister.

12:44.570 --> 12:46.860
Or his pet lamb.

12:53.490 --> 12:55.140
Do you want me to make supper?

12:55.290 --> 12:59.054
Some idiot has blown the fuse box
so the cooker isn't working.

12:59.210 --> 13:01.099
We're not going to have
power until tomorrow.

13:01.250 --> 13:02.854
What are we gonna do tonight then?

13:03.370 --> 13:06.135
Well, I am gonna sit out back,
I'm gonna drink some beer

13:06.290 --> 13:08.099
and I'm gonna have sex under the stars.

13:08.530 --> 13:11.394
I mean, you can join in if you like.

13:11.570 --> 13:14.577
- Can we not use the range?
- You'll burn your ass, babe.

13:15.090 --> 13:16.899
Maybe just for the cooking then?

13:17.050 --> 13:20.611
Yeah, maybe. If we can light it
without burning the house down.

13:36.770 --> 13:38.977
It's weird having no one else around.

13:39.490 --> 13:40.537
Yeah.

13:42.290 --> 13:45.141
- What are you doing?
- You trust me?

13:45.463 --> 13:47.069
No.

13:48.170 --> 13:50.138
Do you trust me?

13:50.690 --> 13:51.896
I suppose so.

14:11.770 --> 14:13.693
- Sarah.
- Undo your belt.

14:17.690 --> 14:18.791
Get it out.

14:29.210 --> 14:30.894
Do you want me to suck it?

14:31.410 --> 14:34.496
I don't think that's the best way
to make wild country bumpkins...

14:34.690 --> 14:37.170
Do you want me to suck your cock?

14:38.410 --> 14:39.650
Yes.

14:51.690 --> 14:52.930
Sarah.

14:59.770 --> 15:00.851
Sarah.

15:10.770 --> 15:12.135
Sarah?

15:54.210 --> 15:56.731
Are you just gonna stand there perving
or are you gonna get undressed?

15:56.890 --> 15:58.176
It depends.

15:58.530 --> 16:00.532
What is there to get undressed for?

18:32.330 --> 18:35.773
Oh, my God, you are taking that
to the charity shop.

18:36.750 --> 18:38.150
Fuck off.

18:38.290 --> 18:39.894
- Give it here.
- No.

18:40.050 --> 18:41.461
Give it here, please.

18:53.410 --> 18:55.299
Wow, my perfect woman.

18:59.770 --> 19:01.374
I have to brush my teeth.

19:01.530 --> 19:03.976
Will you have a look?
Page four, curtains.

19:04.490 --> 19:05.730
- Curtains.
- Please.

19:22.010 --> 19:23.375
Ed?

19:28.130 --> 19:31.976
Ed, hon. Where are the toothbrushes?

19:32.730 --> 19:33.856
I dunno.

19:35.530 --> 19:40.900
Did you bring them in from the car? Ed?

19:43.850 --> 19:46.740
No, I didn't bring them in from the car.

19:46.890 --> 19:51.441
Baby, could you go out and get them
for me because it's a bit dark?

19:55.370 --> 19:57.452
Ed?

21:52.330 --> 21:53.411
Ed?

21:54.410 --> 21:56.890
Ed? I think there's someone outside

21:57.090 --> 21:59.741
- hiding in the yard.
- What are you talking about?

21:59.930 --> 22:02.012
I just heard something
making funny noises.

22:02.170 --> 22:04.093
Sarah, we're in the country, alright?

22:05.010 --> 22:06.694
Loads of things make funny noises.

22:06.890 --> 22:09.291
It was probably a fox or an owl.

22:09.450 --> 22:11.578
- No, this was something else.
- Like what?

22:11.770 --> 22:14.580
Like a crazy person making weird noises.

22:14.730 --> 22:16.334
What kind of noises?

22:17.050 --> 22:19.576
Just weird noises, I don't know.

22:19.730 --> 22:21.061
It's probably a bear.

22:22.050 --> 22:23.814
Are there bears in Scotland?

22:23.970 --> 22:28.060
No, there are no bears in Scotland.
Honey, please just come back to bed.

22:28.250 --> 22:30.139
I can't, not until you've had a look.

22:30.330 --> 22:33.104
- Sarah.
- Please.

22:33.404 --> 22:34.894
Fuck.

22:35.730 --> 22:37.175
- Fine.
- Thank you.

22:37.330 --> 22:38.456
Let's go.

22:44.290 --> 22:45.655
Torch.

23:03.250 --> 23:08.859
Right, so where did you see
this... this creature?

23:09.010 --> 23:12.014
It's over there. Yeah.

23:18.770 --> 23:21.979
- What, in here?
- No, it was behind that.

23:24.290 --> 23:28.351
- What, behind the tractor?
- No, it was behind the shed.

23:33.970 --> 23:35.256
Will you be careful?

23:46.970 --> 23:48.415
Nope.

23:50.770 --> 23:52.374
I swear I saw something.

23:53.130 --> 23:56.816
Well, there's nothing there now.
Come on.

23:58.170 --> 24:00.537
Come on, let's go back to bed.

24:08.170 --> 24:09.501
Ed!

24:13.170 --> 24:16.674
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck, it's a pig!

24:17.690 --> 24:20.421
- Oh, my God!
- Fuck.

24:20.610 --> 24:21.850
That is not...

24:22.010 --> 24:24.934
- That is not funny.
- Fuck.

24:25.170 --> 24:27.616
Did you see that before
and you didn't tell me?

24:27.770 --> 24:30.614
No! No, of course I didn't,
why would I do that?

24:32.810 --> 24:34.096
Well, where did it come from?

24:35.130 --> 24:36.670
Dunno.

24:40.250 --> 24:42.491
- What?
- What's that smell?

24:43.370 --> 24:44.576
What?

24:45.010 --> 24:46.296
Oh, babe.

24:47.610 --> 24:49.021
What?

24:49.170 --> 24:51.035
Have you shat yourself?

24:52.250 --> 24:53.456
Come on.

24:53.970 --> 24:55.415
Probably.

25:21.170 --> 25:22.882
Ed.

25:23.543 --> 25:26.590
Ed, there's someone in the house.

25:28.050 --> 25:30.701
- What?
- There's someone in the house.

25:34.450 --> 25:35.690
Listen.

25:36.370 --> 25:38.020
Just go back to sleep, baby.

25:43.370 --> 25:44.651
Did you hear that?

25:57.690 --> 25:59.579
- Where are you going now?
- Just wait.

26:09.650 --> 26:10.936
Can you see anything?

26:17.170 --> 26:18.501
No.

26:34.770 --> 26:37.296
- Where are you going?
- To have a look.

26:47.890 --> 26:49.335
Hello?

26:53.450 --> 26:54.940
Give me the torch.

26:56.730 --> 26:58.971
What if there's somebody down there?

26:59.130 --> 27:02.134
Then I'll tell them to...
Get the fuck out of my house!

27:37.730 --> 27:39.255
We've called the police.

27:41.650 --> 27:43.140
Can you hear me?

27:45.170 --> 27:47.059
Sarah, go to the bedroom, lock the door.

27:47.210 --> 27:49.736
- Sarah, will you just please?
- I'm not going without you.

28:22.090 --> 28:23.330
What is it?

28:23.490 --> 28:26.175
The back door's open. Shit!

29:53.370 --> 29:54.656
Hold that.

30:04.050 --> 30:06.417
- Didn't you lock it?
- You closed it.

30:06.570 --> 30:08.095
- Did I?
- Yeah.

30:08.290 --> 30:11.214
- I must have forgotten.
- So it just blew open?

30:11.370 --> 30:12.781
Well, I guess it did.

30:14.730 --> 30:17.301
Oh, come on, look.
I'll make sure it's locked now, OK?

30:17.450 --> 30:18.815
What if there is someone in there?

30:19.010 --> 30:21.661
- There's no one in here.
- How do you know?

30:21.810 --> 30:24.290
- I just looked!
- Not the front room.

30:24.450 --> 30:26.930
- Look properly. Or upstairs.
- Come on.

30:28.890 --> 30:32.441
- Do you really want me to do this?
- Yeah, I do.

30:33.010 --> 30:34.296
Do it.

30:37.690 --> 30:42.252
OK. Well, come on then,

30:42.450 --> 30:45.135
or do you want me to leave
this open all night?

30:51.330 --> 30:54.459
- Where did you put the key?
- I didn't put the key anywhere.

31:03.650 --> 31:04.697
OK.

31:04.890 --> 31:06.380
Now do you want to lock it?

31:21.010 --> 31:22.341
Ed?

31:44.290 --> 31:45.270
Bastard!

31:45.370 --> 31:48.533
Fee fi fo fum,

31:48.690 --> 31:51.421
I smell the fear of an Englishwoman.

31:52.050 --> 31:54.576
I don't like it,
would you please stop it?

31:54.770 --> 31:57.171
- Oh, and these are boobies.
- Stop it!

31:57.330 --> 32:00.356
Would you just stop it? Stop it!

32:01.250 --> 32:04.732
Alright, Jesus. Just trying
to have a bit of a laugh.

32:05.690 --> 32:09.615
I'm sorry. It's not funny, OK?

32:47.490 --> 32:49.697
Maybe we should go and find a B&B?

32:51.090 --> 32:54.014
OK, OK, now you're just being silly.

32:54.170 --> 32:56.616
Just for one night
until we get the power sorted.

32:56.770 --> 32:58.613
Sarah, it's past midnight.

32:58.770 --> 33:00.772
There's not gonna be anywhere
that's open.

33:01.770 --> 33:02.976
OK?

33:03.650 --> 33:05.015
Come here.

33:16.290 --> 33:18.258
Now what are you doing?

33:18.410 --> 33:21.573
I'm just gonna show people
there's someone in the house.

33:22.210 --> 33:23.621
Why?

33:24.170 --> 33:27.299
It's been empty for almost
a year, maybe it's been used.

33:27.490 --> 33:28.696
By who?

33:30.010 --> 33:33.651
Tramps. Or that kid,
I mean, what was he doing here?

33:33.810 --> 33:35.699
He was just some kid.

33:35.850 --> 33:38.456
He's not gonna turn up
in the middle of the night.

33:38.610 --> 33:42.531
He'll be at home, sleeping in bed,
which is exactly what we should be doing.

33:43.010 --> 33:46.901
I can't. I'm in a strange house,
I'm scared.

33:47.650 --> 33:51.258
- Can't this bloody thing get brighter?
- Because it's probably run out of gas.

33:51.410 --> 33:54.619
And this strange house?
This is our home now. Alright?

33:54.810 --> 33:56.778
So you've just got to get used to it.

33:57.410 --> 33:59.174
I hate it when you're like this.

33:59.330 --> 34:02.413
It's not much fun for me either,
thanks for being so considerate.

34:02.610 --> 34:03.941
Yeah, same to you.

34:06.970 --> 34:08.301
Asshole.

34:35.489 --> 34:37.618
I saw some candles in the kitchen.

34:38.610 --> 34:41.773
Babe, will you get them
and put them in the windows?

34:44.290 --> 34:46.132
Ed? Please.

34:46.290 --> 34:48.418
If you want candles,
you go and get them.

34:48.610 --> 34:51.375
- I'm not going on my own.
- I'm not going, full stop!

34:52.010 --> 34:55.534
- I won't sleep.
- Yeah, well, I will.

34:58.450 --> 35:01.738
Ed, will you stop being
such a selfish twat?

35:01.890 --> 35:03.540
Oh, for fuck's sake.

35:10.770 --> 35:12.772
No, you stay here.

35:13.250 --> 35:14.900
I don't want to be here on my own.

35:15.050 --> 35:18.611
Just get back into the bed.
And stop being so stupid.

35:18.810 --> 35:20.653
- I'm not being stupid.
- Yes, you are.

35:20.850 --> 35:22.852
You're being bloody stupid.

35:23.010 --> 35:24.375
This is our first night in this house,

35:24.530 --> 35:28.774
and this is how you're going on?
Jesus Christ.

36:24.370 --> 36:27.613
Oh. Thank you, God.

36:51.210 --> 36:54.372
Thanks for getting
the power back on, babe.

37:08.730 --> 37:09.936
Ed?

37:55.250 --> 37:56.536
Ed?

37:59.970 --> 38:01.256
Ed?

38:03.370 --> 38:05.418
Baby, this isn't funny anymore.

38:27.970 --> 38:30.621
Ed, I know I've been a pain in the ass.

38:32.130 --> 38:33.894
Please don't do this to me.

38:50.770 --> 38:51.896
Ed?

42:16.450 --> 42:17.611
Shit.

42:19.770 --> 42:21.659
She's gone out the window.

42:32.410 --> 42:33.775
She can't have gone far.

44:26.530 --> 44:28.373
What have you done to Ed?

44:31.290 --> 44:34.111
What have you done to my husband?

45:13.410 --> 45:16.493
Come on! Get that fucking thing open!

45:22.010 --> 45:23.955
Look out the back.

45:40.250 --> 45:42.504
Where do you think you're going?

45:44.570 --> 45:46.891
Get her in here
and get her fucking bagged.

47:17.610 --> 47:19.021
Anything?

47:20.130 --> 47:22.736
Right, check the barn,
I'm going around the back.

47:22.890 --> 47:24.415
- Alright.
- OK, man.

47:49.850 --> 47:53.775
Come on. Come on. Come on!

49:12.570 --> 49:14.334
- See anything?
- Nah.

49:14.490 --> 49:16.572
So much for the big man's plan.

49:22.410 --> 49:24.014
You go and take a look in the woods.

49:24.170 --> 49:26.935
- What about the big man?
- Let me worry about him.

50:50.370 --> 50:55.579
OK, OK, OK, OK.

52:38.050 --> 52:40.257
Foxy, you find anything?

52:40.610 --> 52:42.294
Found a wee rag with blood on it.

52:42.450 --> 52:45.618
Keep looking. I'll get the lads
to set up a perimeter.

52:45.810 --> 52:46.857
Alright.

56:11.930 --> 56:13.011
Ed.

56:35.650 --> 56:37.254
Bastards.

56:50.370 --> 56:53.838
Hello. Good girl.

56:58.630 --> 57:01.474
Do you want to kiss her? Yeah?

57:03.570 --> 57:05.698
Go on, give her a fucking smacker.

57:07.690 --> 57:10.216
Oh! You don't want to kiss my baby?

57:13.890 --> 57:15.255
Poor piggy.

57:16.730 --> 57:20.015
Now she's gonna gnaw your
fucking balls off, mate.

57:44.010 --> 57:45.899
Baby, baby.

57:51.090 --> 57:53.218
- Are you OK? Are you OK?
- Yes.

57:53.410 --> 57:54.775
Did they hurt you?

57:56.610 --> 57:58.339
It's OK, please just...

57:58.490 --> 58:00.538
- My hands.
- OK.

58:03.450 --> 58:05.896
They're too tight, Ed.
You've got to stay still.

58:06.090 --> 58:07.694
Please, you'll cut your hands.

58:10.490 --> 58:13.414
- Hurry.
- I'm trying to find something.

58:13.570 --> 58:15.652
- Hurry.
- Fuck!

58:19.850 --> 58:22.137
- OK, baby.
- OK, OK, OK.

58:22.290 --> 58:23.974
- Stay still.
- OK.

58:25.210 --> 58:29.181
Kenny, you've left the bleeding
lights on, you muppet.

58:42.010 --> 58:43.500
Jesus!

58:49.410 --> 58:52.016
Fucking bitch! Come on!

58:54.250 --> 58:57.652
You're gonna pay for that!
Come on! Come on!

59:03.210 --> 59:04.655
Let's go.

59:08.250 --> 59:11.140
The keys, the keys,
the Land Rover. He's got them.

59:16.810 --> 59:18.574
Shit, Ed. They're coming.
We have to be quick.

59:20.410 --> 59:21.536
We have to be quick.

59:22.450 --> 59:24.373
Fuck. Fuck! I can't find them.

59:24.530 --> 59:27.534
He has them on him, just try the shelf.

59:30.850 --> 59:33.091
- Shit, they're not here.
- Hurry.

59:50.130 --> 59:51.495
Sarah.

59:53.330 --> 59:55.458
- I can't walk.
- I've got you.

59:57.130 --> 59:58.620
I've got you.

01:00:06.970 --> 01:00:08.335
Go, go.

01:00:18.010 --> 01:00:19.171
Come on.

01:00:27.810 --> 01:00:30.893
Hey, hey! Help.

01:00:34.610 --> 01:00:36.260
Let's go. Go.

01:01:08.610 --> 01:01:10.260
- Fuck!
- Come on.

01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:12.176
They're not far behind.

01:01:13.410 --> 01:01:16.334
- I'm slowing us down.
- Come on.

01:01:16.530 --> 01:01:18.931
We've just got to keep on going,
Sarah, please.

01:01:19.090 --> 01:01:20.854
- I can't.
- Listen to me, come on.

01:01:22.290 --> 01:01:23.735
Get down.

01:01:25.450 --> 01:01:27.771
OK, OK, OK.

01:01:28.530 --> 01:01:30.897
OK, this is what we're gonna do.

01:01:33.370 --> 01:01:35.498
You're gonna stay here, under cover.

01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:37.414
What are you gonna do?

01:01:37.570 --> 01:01:40.335
I'm gonna run up on ahead,
and I'm gonna distract them.

01:01:40.490 --> 01:01:44.176
- No...
- Listen, listen to me, please.

01:01:44.330 --> 01:01:47.140
When you know it's safe,
you run up that way,

01:01:47.290 --> 01:01:49.736
and keep on going
until you hit the dirt road.

01:01:49.890 --> 01:01:51.779
You know the one we came in on?

01:01:51.930 --> 01:01:54.615
At the end of that, there's the
main road. I'll meet you there.

01:01:55.530 --> 01:01:59.137
OK, OK, OK. Keep still.

01:02:04.450 --> 01:02:06.737
This way, we've got a chance.

01:02:07.330 --> 01:02:08.456
I love you.

01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:17.578
What are we gonna do about Kenny?

01:02:17.730 --> 01:02:19.732
Did you see his face?
They smashed it in.

01:02:19.930 --> 01:02:20.931
Shh.

01:02:23.490 --> 01:02:24.935
You hear that?

01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:28.299
We need to make these bastards pay.

01:02:28.450 --> 01:02:30.976
We need to catch them first.
Now shut the fuck up.

01:02:38.730 --> 01:02:40.061
Over here!

01:03:42.690 --> 01:03:45.057
Come on, you fat bastard, keep up.

01:04:54.610 --> 01:04:55.941
Looky, looky.

01:04:58.290 --> 01:05:02.090
I know you're out here.
Do you think I'm stupid?

01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:06.494
Bloody bugger,
you should be in your bed.

01:05:08.010 --> 01:05:10.592
You'll be in trouble with your mammy.

01:06:24.970 --> 01:06:26.574
Where do you think you're going?

01:06:27.610 --> 01:06:29.817
You're gonna crawl back
across the border,

01:06:30.010 --> 01:06:33.492
is that what you're gonna do?
You're not going anywhere.

01:06:36.290 --> 01:06:40.090
This is for Kenny, you English bastard.

01:06:42.850 --> 01:06:44.454
What the fuck are you playing at?

01:06:44.650 --> 01:06:46.254
I'm gonna fucking do him for Kenny.

01:06:46.410 --> 01:06:48.890
- Give me that thing.
- What about my brother?

01:06:49.050 --> 01:06:51.894
What have I told you? Stick to the plan.

01:06:52.050 --> 01:06:54.371
- The plan's fucked.
- No, it's not.

01:06:54.530 --> 01:06:56.532
We catch them, then get rid of them.

01:06:57.930 --> 01:06:59.216
For fuck's sake!

01:07:35.610 --> 01:07:36.736
Fuck!

01:07:59.170 --> 01:08:00.251
Fuck off!

01:08:06.170 --> 01:08:08.616
Easy, boy. Easy now.

01:08:10.490 --> 01:08:11.901
Get him bagged!

01:08:13.210 --> 01:08:16.612
No. No! No! No!

01:08:22.130 --> 01:08:23.370
Ed!

01:08:37.649 --> 01:08:39.379
Baby.

01:10:27.570 --> 01:10:30.221
Can you show me how to get to the road?

01:10:36.690 --> 01:10:38.055
Please?

01:11:40.170 --> 01:11:43.140
Hey, how far is it now?

01:15:47.570 --> 01:15:48.981
Ed?

01:15:50.530 --> 01:15:51.736
Ed!

01:15:53.090 --> 01:15:54.251
Ed!

01:15:54.450 --> 01:15:56.214
Where the fuck is he?

01:15:56.410 --> 01:15:58.538
What the fuck have you done to him?

01:15:59.850 --> 01:16:02.217
Shh. It's over.

01:17:17.490 --> 01:17:19.652
We're gonna be doing
a bit of work up the top there.

01:17:19.810 --> 01:17:21.812
- Guys, have a look at this.
- What's that?

01:17:23.410 --> 01:17:27.096
Show these guys.
Hey, guys. Have a look at this.

01:17:27.530 --> 01:17:31.421
Look at that.
That's your Grandpa Willy, aye.

01:18:01.650 --> 01:18:05.939
Hey, you're OK. You're OK.
You're OK. You're alright.
