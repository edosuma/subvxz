WEBVTT

00:01.293 --> 00:03.011
MABEL: Whoa!

00:03.212 --> 00:04.930
That cloud looks
like a chipmunk.

00:05.130 --> 00:06.256
WENDY:
Barfing an airplane.

00:06.465 --> 00:07.933
(all laughing)
DIPPER: It does.

00:08.132 --> 00:11.387
THOMPSON: Uh, that cloud
looks like...uh, a cloud.

00:11.595 --> 00:12.517
LEE:Boo!

00:12.846 --> 00:14.974
WENDY: Thompson, stop being
the worst at everything.

00:15.182 --> 00:16.434
( Chuckles )
Sorry, guys.

00:16.600 --> 00:17.772
(all laughing)

00:17.976 --> 00:19.819
Look at the clouds.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.773
Ooh! That cloud looks like
a big heart-shaped balloon.

00:22.981 --> 00:25.404
Clouds don't come in colors.
That is a balloon.

00:25.609 --> 00:27.862
Oh, dude,
it's the Woodstick festival.

00:28.070 --> 00:29.242
Wait.
The Wood what?

00:29.446 --> 00:31.073
It's this annual
outdoor concert

00:31.240 --> 00:33.413
featuring Oregon's
up-and-coming indie bands.

00:33.617 --> 00:35.836
Hey.
They're all coming.

00:36.036 --> 00:39.381
Scarves Indoors, Wood grain
on Everything, Love God.

00:39.581 --> 00:41.003
You've probably seen
him in that viral video.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.006
<i>Who's ready
for love tonight?</i>

00:43.210 --> 00:45.008
<i>Oh. Ow! Ow!</i>

00:45.212 --> 00:47.214
<i>I hope nobody's
filming this.</i>

00:47.422 --> 00:49.675
Whoa, like
a real <i>concert</i> concert?

00:49.841 --> 00:52.219
I've-- I've never actually
been to one of those before.

00:52.427 --> 00:53.644
That's because you've never
had an awesome crew

00:53.845 --> 00:54.641
to roll with before.

00:54.846 --> 00:55.972
Come on, Thompson.

00:56.181 --> 00:58.400
ALL: Lick that sponge.
Lick that sponge.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.152
Oh! I can't believe
he's doing it.

01:00.352 --> 01:01.820
What is he doing?

01:02.020 --> 01:03.738
When you're with us,
you're in.

01:06.108 --> 01:07.781
( Man moaning )

01:11.572 --> 01:12.744
Ghosty sounds.

01:12.948 --> 01:15.121
Cemetery ghosty sounds!

01:15.284 --> 01:16.410
It's coming
from that open grave.

01:16.618 --> 01:18.416
( Moaning continues )

01:19.788 --> 01:21.131
You look.
No. You look.

01:21.331 --> 01:22.674
Thompson, go look.

01:22.874 --> 01:24.296
Heh. Nice use of Thompson.

01:24.501 --> 01:26.048
Gaze upon death.

01:26.253 --> 01:29.006
ALL: Gaze upon death.
Gaze upon death.

01:29.214 --> 01:30.511
Gaze upon death.

01:30.716 --> 01:31.842
Gaze upon death.

01:32.050 --> 01:33.142
( Screaming )

02:15.260 --> 02:18.013
Ugh! It's even creepier
than I expected.

02:18.221 --> 02:19.848
( Robbie groans )

02:21.516 --> 02:24.019
Why did she leave me?

02:24.227 --> 02:25.194
Robbie?

02:25.395 --> 02:26.487
Wendy! Oh. Uh.

02:26.688 --> 02:27.814
( Nervous chuckle )

02:29.191 --> 02:30.568
Hey, what's up?

02:30.776 --> 02:32.904
Just hanging out
in this grave, you know.

02:33.111 --> 02:35.409
Regular.
Regular day for me.

02:35.614 --> 02:37.992
Whoa, dude, we haven't seen
you in, like, a million years.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.122
Where have you been?

02:39.284 --> 02:41.002
You're not still mourning
our break-up, are you?

02:41.161 --> 02:42.663
What? No way.

02:44.081 --> 02:46.083
Robbie, we split up
forever ago.

02:46.291 --> 02:48.214
It's really sweet you'd throw
yourself into a grave for me,

02:48.418 --> 02:50.170
but, man, time to move on.

02:50.379 --> 02:52.302
What?
I've totally moved on.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.224
( Cell phone rings )
<i>J' Wendy, I miss you so much ♪</i>

02:54.424 --> 02:55.767
<i>♪ I'll never move on A“</i>

02:55.967 --> 02:57.594
<i>♪ Never ever r</i>

02:57.761 --> 03:00.310
That was a different Wendy.
Unrelated Wendy.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.482
Dude, this is getting
really awkward.

03:02.641 --> 03:04.564
Yeah, the cemetery
used to be fun.

03:04.768 --> 03:05.815
Now it's just depressing.

03:09.398 --> 03:11.116
( Sighs )

03:14.236 --> 03:16.409
Wait.
You guys, he's in pain.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.081
We can't just
ditch him here.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.082
Come on, Mabel.

03:19.241 --> 03:20.117
It's Robbie.

03:20.283 --> 03:21.910
But he's suffering.

03:22.119 --> 03:25.043
How can I be happy if I know
someone else is sad?

03:25.205 --> 03:27.424
It totally throws off
my Happiness Chart.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.215
Mabel, trust me.

03:31.420 --> 03:32.672
If there's one thing
I've learned this summer,

03:32.879 --> 03:35.473
it's not to get mixed up
in needless romantic drama.

03:35.674 --> 03:38.678
Besides, we're finally
in with Wendy's friends.

03:38.885 --> 03:41.308
With Robbie gone,
there's a good social balance.

03:41.513 --> 03:43.561
Maybe we should just let
a good thing be, you know?

03:45.350 --> 03:47.819
Just eat me already, man.

03:48.019 --> 03:49.316
Aaah!
I was just being dramatic.

03:49.479 --> 03:50.321
Quit it. Ow! Ow!

03:50.480 --> 03:51.606
My face.
Vulture!

03:53.442 --> 03:54.659
Oh, man.

03:54.860 --> 03:57.079
I'm sorry you guys
had to see that.

03:57.279 --> 03:58.496
You know,
what Robbie needs?

03:58.697 --> 03:59.914
A new girl.

04:00.115 --> 04:02.083
Romance is like gum.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.916
Once it's lost its flavor,
you just cram another one in.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.081
Mabel, it's not that easy.

04:08.290 --> 04:10.918
It is if you're the world's
greatest matchmaker.

04:11.126 --> 04:13.379
I've never had
an unhappy customer.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.055
Like Soos and Melody.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.096
Watch this.

04:16.298 --> 04:18.050
Walking down
some actual stairs.

04:18.257 --> 04:18.975
<i>( Qiggles )</i>

04:19.176 --> 04:20.052
Did it look cool?

04:20.260 --> 04:21.055
<i>The coolest.</i>

04:21.261 --> 04:22.888
Match made!

04:23.096 --> 04:25.599
And then, of course,
there's Waddles and Gompers.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.401
( Bleating )

04:30.020 --> 04:31.272
Match made.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.107
That might work
for a goat and a pig,

04:33.315 --> 04:34.441
but Robbie's
a hopeless case.

04:34.649 --> 04:37.949
Hopeless case, e-e-e-e-eh...?

04:38.153 --> 04:41.999
♪ Putting a rainbow wig
on a big white gorilla ♪

04:44.034 --> 04:45.377
What the...?

04:45.577 --> 04:47.955
Oh, no.
Hot air balloons.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.294
Fixed gear bikes.

04:50.499 --> 04:52.672
♪ Singing
'bout the open road ♪

04:52.876 --> 04:55.220
♪ My sandals
are so open-toed ♪

04:56.546 --> 04:59.049
Folk music!
It's the Woodstick Festival!

04:59.257 --> 05:01.225
Soos! Lock down the Shack
and hide my shirts

05:01.426 --> 05:03.724
before anyone
tie-dyes them!

05:03.929 --> 05:04.930
They're slow.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.355
I can probably
take a few down.

05:06.556 --> 05:08.024
Wait, Mr. Pines!

05:08.225 --> 05:09.772
( Bird cawing )
I've been thinking.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.523
Every year
this festival comes by

05:11.728 --> 05:13.981
and every year you shun what
could be potential customers.

05:14.189 --> 05:16.066
You really think I can
make money off of these

05:16.274 --> 05:18.652
free-loading, kale-munching
freak shows?

05:18.860 --> 05:21.033
You just got to figure out
what appeals to them.

05:21.238 --> 05:24.242
Hmm. How do I appeal
to young people?

05:27.327 --> 05:31.298
So young people are into
hot air balloons, e-e-e-e-eh?

05:33.124 --> 05:34.967
All right, Mabel.

05:35.168 --> 05:36.670
Robbie's a broken teacup,

05:36.878 --> 05:39.131
and you're going to
piece him back together.

05:40.632 --> 05:42.009
( Doorbell plays
spooky music )

05:42.217 --> 05:44.185
Okay, this could get intense.

05:44.386 --> 05:45.979
( Qasps )

05:46.179 --> 05:47.180
Howdy doo!

05:47.389 --> 05:49.016
<i>Happy CRY'-!</i>

05:49.224 --> 05:50.817
It <i>is</i> intense!

05:51.017 --> 05:52.940
<i>You're</i> Robbie's parents?

05:53.144 --> 05:53.986
I always thought
he was, like,

05:54.187 --> 05:56.189
raised by sad wolves
or something.

05:56.398 --> 05:58.446
Oh, well, he doesn't
like to talk about us.

05:58.650 --> 06:01.073
He always says we're too
cheerful for funeral directors.

06:01.278 --> 06:03.246
( Both laughing )

06:03.405 --> 06:04.782
Come in.
Come in.

06:07.409 --> 06:08.752
Cracker platter?

06:08.952 --> 06:10.670
Oh, no time for crackers.
Sorry.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.293
I'm here
to cheer Robbie up.

06:12.497 --> 06:14.465
Cannot have a dry cracker
mouth for that.

06:14.666 --> 06:17.135
Robbie Stacey Valentino!

06:17.335 --> 06:18.507
There's little a girl
here to see you.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.055
You go on up.

06:20.255 --> 06:21.757
And could you bring
him his lunch?

06:21.923 --> 06:24.346
Lady, I like your style.

06:24.551 --> 06:25.803
( Mabel giggles )

06:26.011 --> 06:27.934
You know who would look good
in a sweater like that?

06:28.138 --> 06:29.731
Mrs. Grabelson's remains!

06:29.931 --> 06:31.228
Oh, absolutely!

06:43.862 --> 06:45.239
Robbie, it's Mabel!

06:45.405 --> 06:46.657
Who?

06:46.865 --> 06:49.118
Remember me?
I'm like Girl Dipper.

06:49.284 --> 06:50.627
Ugh, go away.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.124
I heard a "come in."

06:54.664 --> 06:56.041
Ahh! Hey!

06:56.249 --> 06:58.297
Listen, kid, nobody
in the Pines family

06:58.501 --> 06:59.718
is welcome here.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.888
In case you forgot,
your stupid brother

07:02.088 --> 07:03.556
is the one
who ruined my life!

07:05.759 --> 07:07.807
And Mabel's the one
who's gonna fix it.

07:08.011 --> 07:11.891
Listen, Robbie, I always used
to see you as a creepy jerk.

07:12.098 --> 07:14.192
Like the human version
of rat poison.

07:14.392 --> 07:15.939
Uh, go on.

07:16.144 --> 07:18.112
But when I saw you
in the cemetery today,

07:18.313 --> 07:20.407
I realized,
Robbie's not a bad guy.

07:20.565 --> 07:22.112
He's just
a heartbroken soul

07:22.317 --> 07:24.991
who needs love--
and gloves with fingers.

07:25.195 --> 07:26.788
Hey, fingerless gloves
look awesome.

07:26.988 --> 07:28.160
No, they don't.

07:28.323 --> 07:30.997
Robbie, you just need
a good matchmaker.

07:31.159 --> 07:33.207
I guarantee
I'll find you true love,

07:33.411 --> 07:35.084
or twice your sadness back.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.336
If I say yes,
will you leave my room?

07:39.668 --> 07:41.215
I guarantee it.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.969
( Knuckles crack )

07:45.173 --> 07:48.848
Okay, Gravity Falls, who wants
to go out with Robbie?

07:52.263 --> 07:55.517
Okay.
Lazy Susan, too old.

07:55.684 --> 07:57.106
Grenda, too young.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.529
<i>Mum-Bear?</i>

07:59.729 --> 08:02.073
I'm putting you
in the "maybe" pile.

08:02.273 --> 08:06.119
Who could it be?
Who could it be?

08:06.319 --> 08:07.366
( Bleating )
( squealing )

08:07.570 --> 08:08.617
What's that, Gompers?

08:08.822 --> 08:10.074
Someone we already know?

08:10.240 --> 08:11.867
But who could possibly
be superficial

08:12.075 --> 08:13.622
<i>and</i> gothy enough for--

08:13.827 --> 08:15.829
( squeals )
Of course, that's it!

08:16.037 --> 08:19.416
You two really are America's
favorite power couple.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.090
More snacks!
More snacks!

08:23.294 --> 08:24.045
More snacks!

08:24.254 --> 08:26.222
I'm just happy to be included.

08:27.424 --> 08:29.097
Ha!
This is brilliant.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.428
The perfect way to sneak cheap
snacks into the concert.

08:31.636 --> 08:32.852
And it was all
Dipper's idea.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.020
<i>Whoa!
Nice.</i>

08:34.222 --> 08:35.438
Well done.
Ideas!

08:35.597 --> 08:38.226
Kid, I sense greatness in you.

08:38.434 --> 08:41.029
( Chuckles )
Oh, well, I don't know about--

08:41.229 --> 08:42.321
Greatness!

08:42.480 --> 08:44.107
All right, now,
everyone go home

08:44.315 --> 08:45.612
and finish getting
ready for the concert.

08:46.735 --> 08:48.112
Hey, don't wait up, Tambers.

08:48.319 --> 08:49.070
Don't call me Tambers.

08:49.279 --> 08:50.246
Ha-ha!

08:50.447 --> 08:52.040
Classic Tambers.

08:52.198 --> 08:55.202
"Tambry.
You. Me. Date.

08:55.410 --> 08:57.629
"Bring that sweet,
sweet bod.

08:57.829 --> 08:59.206
Your secret admirer."

09:03.501 --> 09:05.970
Love is about to happen,
Lazy Susan.

09:06.171 --> 09:07.297
Watch and learn.

09:11.342 --> 09:13.310
Ugh!
Robbie?

09:13.511 --> 09:14.933
You're my secret admirer?

09:15.138 --> 09:16.515
Tambry?
Ugh!

09:16.681 --> 09:18.308
This is just what I get
for trusting a toddler.

09:18.516 --> 09:20.518
Listen, I don't think
this is gonna work out.

09:20.685 --> 09:22.278
Dating somebody
I already know?

09:22.479 --> 09:23.947
It's kind of like
admitting defeat.

09:24.147 --> 09:25.694
Um, way to assume
I'm even interested.

09:25.899 --> 09:26.991
Tambry, let's be real.

09:27.192 --> 09:29.194
If I wanted to date you,
I would have done it already.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.078
I'm just a little
out of your league.

09:31.279 --> 09:32.075
Whoa, is that mustard?

09:32.238 --> 09:33.831
Don't want to waste
that bad boy.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.326
Status update.

09:36.534 --> 09:37.751
On blind date
with sociopath.

09:37.952 --> 09:38.999
Oh, sure.
Bring out the phone.

09:39.162 --> 09:40.505
Classic Tambers.

09:40.705 --> 09:41.957
Hey, can I get
some chili fries?

09:42.123 --> 09:43.591
To go.

09:43.792 --> 09:45.760
What?
How is this possible?

09:45.919 --> 09:48.047
I'm supposed to be
the best matchmaker ever.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.050
Did you hear that?
Did you hear that?

09:49.255 --> 09:50.723
Let's go.
Let's go.

09:52.509 --> 09:53.931
<i>Whoa-hoe!</i>

09:54.135 --> 09:56.979
Who's ready to fall
in love tonight?

09:57.180 --> 09:58.397
ALL: Love God!

09:58.598 --> 09:59.645
( All cheering )

10:01.267 --> 10:02.894
That's what they call me.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.696
We're rewriting
history tonight,

10:04.896 --> 10:07.069
and it starts
with you and you.

10:09.526 --> 10:12.120
Love is real
and it's in your face!

10:12.278 --> 10:13.495
( Chuckles )

10:13.696 --> 10:15.698
What's your name,
you little angel?

10:15.907 --> 10:17.124
( Chuckles )
Meredith.

10:17.283 --> 10:19.536
Meredith, Meredith,
we got a problem.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.337
That cutie right there
is your soulmate

10:21.538 --> 10:22.710
and you're living
without him.

10:22.914 --> 10:23.961
Oh, no.

10:24.165 --> 10:25.041
What do I do?

10:25.250 --> 10:26.968
Get it, girl.
You know what you love.

10:27.168 --> 10:28.920
Pow!
Match made!

10:30.004 --> 10:30.846
Ha-ha!

10:31.047 --> 10:33.425
I must know how this works!

10:35.009 --> 10:35.931
Hi.
Love God?

10:36.136 --> 10:37.604
Mabel here.
Big fan.

10:37.762 --> 10:40.140
Can I just say, that was some
of the finest matchmaking

10:40.348 --> 10:41.565
I've ever seen?

10:41.724 --> 10:44.318
Can you please, please,
please tell me your secret?

10:44.519 --> 10:47.398
Well, between you and me,
let's just say,

10:47.564 --> 10:50.033
my name's not exactly
a coincidence.

10:51.151 --> 10:53.279
Oh. My. Love God.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.238
Are you an actual Love God?

10:55.446 --> 10:57.073
Call me a cherub.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.083
The Internet pretty much does
my job for me nowadays,

10:59.242 --> 11:01.415
so I've taken some time
to focus on my rock career.

11:01.619 --> 11:02.541
Boom.
Cassette.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.042
Boom.
For you.

11:04.247 --> 11:07.877
Oh!
That's...great.

11:08.042 --> 11:10.386
So anyway, can you make
anything fall in love?

11:10.587 --> 11:12.260
Like that snake
and that badger?

11:12.463 --> 11:14.636
( Hissing and growling )

11:14.799 --> 11:16.722
Hmm.
Ah, gee, I don't know.

11:16.926 --> 11:18.143
That might be
kind of hard to--

11:18.344 --> 11:19.846
Ka-boom!
Match made!

11:23.558 --> 11:25.435
They're gonna
make a snadger.

11:25.602 --> 11:26.854
How you doing that?

11:27.061 --> 11:28.938
Love potion, yo.
I got it all.

11:29.147 --> 11:31.821
Summer love,
young love, anti-love.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.824
You just got to put a little
on your fingers and pow!

11:35.028 --> 11:36.075
I need that potion.

11:36.279 --> 11:37.371
How much would it cost?

11:37.572 --> 11:39.245
Um, would you accept
squirrels as payment?

11:39.449 --> 11:40.792
Whoa-oh-oh!

11:40.992 --> 11:41.993
No way.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.003
You might think you know
what's best for people,

11:44.162 --> 11:46.881
but this stuff can have
major social consequences.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.634
That's why it can only be
used by a serious expert.

11:49.834 --> 11:50.756
Love God!

11:50.919 --> 11:52.011
Sign my face.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.260
Only if you sign mine, baby.
Let's get weird!

11:54.464 --> 11:56.307
( Squeaks )

11:59.510 --> 12:00.682
Shh.

12:02.180 --> 12:06.026
Mind if I add a little
something to these fries?

12:06.226 --> 12:07.648
I don't see why not.

12:14.108 --> 12:17.863
Whoa! Did your whole thing
suddenly get a lot more likeable?

12:19.572 --> 12:22.121
You don't seem as needy
as I used to think you were.

12:22.283 --> 12:24.752
Hey, you wouldn't want to
maybe get out of here and,

12:24.953 --> 12:27.502
I don't know, go kiss
in public a lot?

12:27.705 --> 12:29.503
For some reason, I do.

12:29.707 --> 12:30.924
Status update.

12:31.960 --> 12:34.008
You know what?
Forget it.

12:34.212 --> 12:35.304
Maybe I should stare
at something

12:35.505 --> 12:36.927
other than my phone
for a while.

12:39.217 --> 12:40.560
Match made!

12:42.470 --> 12:44.017
All right, who's ready
for the best

12:44.222 --> 12:46.566
and most overpriced
day of our summer?

12:46.724 --> 12:48.146
Whoo-hoo!
Yay! All right!

12:48.351 --> 12:50.228
I brought a baggie
of trail mix

12:50.436 --> 12:53.155
and safety whistles
in case we get separated.

12:53.356 --> 12:54.608
( Clears throat )
Lee.

12:56.234 --> 12:58.453
This kid is a champion.

12:58.653 --> 12:59.745
We're just waiting on Tambry.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.539
Can't leave without Tambry.

13:01.739 --> 13:05.118
Sorry, guys, but Tambry's
a little busy at the moment.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.537
Wink. Wink.

13:06.744 --> 13:08.166
What does that mean?
Why are you winking?

13:08.371 --> 13:11.966
Let's just say she and Robbie
took a trip to Smoochville.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.798
Now everyone's happy!

13:13.960 --> 13:16.213
Wait. Wait.
Robbie and Tambry?

13:16.421 --> 13:17.297
This can't be happening.

13:17.505 --> 13:18.347
How's that?

13:18.548 --> 13:19.640
He knew I liked her.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.096
How could he do this?

13:21.301 --> 13:23.679
Whoa, hold it.
You like Tambry?

13:23.886 --> 13:25.763
And you told Robbie
but not me?

13:25.972 --> 13:27.724
You always make
fun of my crushes, man.

13:27.932 --> 13:29.730
That's what we do,
genius.

13:29.934 --> 13:30.901
Oh. Oh.

13:31.102 --> 13:32.479
This is so like Tambry
to do this.

13:32.687 --> 13:34.109
Date my ex behind my back.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.691
I'm gonna tear her
highlights out.

13:35.898 --> 13:37.571
Guys! Guys! Calm down.

13:37.775 --> 13:38.617
We're gonna be late
for the concert.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.320
Uh, news flash, kid.

13:40.528 --> 13:41.620
I'm not going to the concert.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.118
Not with him.

13:43.281 --> 13:44.407
Hey, that won't be a problem
'cause I'm out.

13:44.615 --> 13:45.741
Me, too.

13:45.950 --> 13:47.827
Wait! Wait!
This group is all I have!

13:48.036 --> 13:49.629
Don't make me go back
to having no friends!

13:49.829 --> 13:51.081
Guys!

13:51.289 --> 13:53.007
Match...made?

13:56.794 --> 13:59.343
Wait, guys. Don't go.
Not my mailbox!

13:59.547 --> 14:01.299
( Grunts ) Ow!

14:01.507 --> 14:03.851
( Growls )
What did you just do?!

14:04.052 --> 14:05.770
I've let these guys
pick on me for years

14:05.970 --> 14:07.017
to keep this group together.

14:07.221 --> 14:09.394
And now they've
totally fallen apart.

14:09.599 --> 14:11.693
But we were all starting
to finally hang out together.

14:11.893 --> 14:13.190
I was one of the gang.

14:13.394 --> 14:15.488
Well, unless you can break up
Robbie and Tambry immediately,

14:15.688 --> 14:16.985
there is no gang.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.316
I have no more friends.

14:18.483 --> 14:21.157
And neither do you.
I'm gonna eat this.

14:22.445 --> 14:24.072
Mabel, what did I tell you

14:24.238 --> 14:26.240
about staying out
of Robbie's personal life?

14:26.449 --> 14:27.826
I know. I know!

14:28.034 --> 14:30.082
I just wanted to be
a good matchmaker.

14:30.244 --> 14:32.667
I never should have gotten
love potion from the Love God.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.374
Wait, love potion?

14:34.582 --> 14:37.085
If you did a spell,
then can't you, like, undo it?

14:37.293 --> 14:38.886
<i>K 93595 )
That's it!</i>

14:39.087 --> 14:40.009
If I undo the spell,

14:40.213 --> 14:42.090
then everyone
will be friends again.

14:42.298 --> 14:44.016
But I'm gonna
need your help.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.265
Also, you are <i>not</i>
pulling off that V-neck.

14:46.469 --> 14:47.311
I know.

14:47.512 --> 14:48.559
Burn it!

14:49.806 --> 14:51.103
Oho! Ha! Ha!

14:55.269 --> 14:57.067
Balloon faster, Soos!

14:57.271 --> 14:58.568
We need this thing
up in the air

14:58.773 --> 15:00.025
before the festival ends.

15:00.233 --> 15:01.530
Are you sure that
that open flame should be

15:01.734 --> 15:03.156
that close to that dangling
cloth and rope?

15:03.319 --> 15:04.912
I'm sure about everything.

15:05.113 --> 15:07.081
Now lube up those engine gears
with some kerosene.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.708
More kerosene!

15:12.120 --> 15:14.919
Unh! Come back, guys!
Come on.

15:15.081 --> 15:17.880
The tickets were 100 bucks.
I sold my watch.

15:18.042 --> 15:19.464
You got to come
to the concert.

15:19.669 --> 15:20.886
Ew, and have
to look at that?

15:21.087 --> 15:22.213
No, thanks.

15:24.841 --> 15:26.969
Ugh, they're doing
that couple hug-walk.

15:27.176 --> 15:28.268
Guys, you're in public.

15:28.469 --> 15:29.391
People can see you.

15:29.595 --> 15:30.767
Dipper.
Come on.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.939
Love God.
Sound check for Love God.

15:35.143 --> 15:36.486
Ow!

15:36.644 --> 15:38.112
Let's make some
miracles happen.

15:38.312 --> 15:39.985
Groupies, bed-head me.

15:40.189 --> 15:41.486
( Chuckles )

15:41.691 --> 15:43.113
Love God's about
to get crazy.

15:43.317 --> 15:44.660
Whoa.
Hey, all right.

15:46.821 --> 15:48.289
Now's our chance.

15:49.490 --> 15:51.083
Here we go.
Let's see.

15:51.242 --> 15:54.746
Puppy love, inter-species love,
love of country music.

15:54.954 --> 15:55.876
Ew.

15:56.038 --> 15:57.665
Oh!
Anti-love.

15:57.874 --> 15:59.876
To reverse the effects
of love potion,

16:00.042 --> 16:03.046
simply spray on your victim and
watch their heart die on the inside.

16:03.254 --> 16:04.005
Sounds good to me.

16:04.213 --> 16:05.931
Hey!

16:06.132 --> 16:08.226
You're the one who's
been stealing my stuff.

16:08.426 --> 16:09.973
I am <i>not</i> loving this.

16:10.178 --> 16:13.478
I'm sorry. But I made a mistake
and I have to fix it.

16:13.639 --> 16:14.936
Kid, I tried to tell you.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.814
This stuff is way
too dangerous.

16:17.018 --> 16:19.066
On my oath as a God,
I cannot let you--

16:19.270 --> 16:20.146
Oh, hey,
where did you just go?

16:20.354 --> 16:21.401
I'm sorry, Love God!

16:21.606 --> 16:22.949
But it's for the good
of my friends!

16:23.149 --> 16:24.196
Come back here!

16:25.234 --> 16:26.235
( Panting )

16:26.402 --> 16:27.324
Dipper, catch!

16:29.238 --> 16:31.787
( Audience cheers )

16:31.991 --> 16:33.538
<i>IA'</i>

16:34.619 --> 16:35.791
Get those kids!

16:37.121 --> 16:38.043
ALL: Halt!

16:38.247 --> 16:40.716
We mustache you to move!

16:41.834 --> 16:42.801
Good one.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.052
( Crowd cheering )

16:45.796 --> 16:47.969
Ooh!
Thank you.

16:48.174 --> 16:49.642
Aagh!

16:49.800 --> 16:51.848
No, no, no, everyone's
touching everything!

16:52.053 --> 16:53.726
Give me back the potion!

16:53.930 --> 16:54.931
Oh, hey, what's up?

16:55.139 --> 16:56.061
Here, have a cassette.

17:00.144 --> 17:02.067
Dang it.
Fly, tiny wings.

17:02.271 --> 17:03.693
Get up there.
Oh!

17:03.898 --> 17:05.400
I haven't had to use
these in a long time.

17:10.780 --> 17:11.952
Dipper. Look.

17:12.156 --> 17:13.373
( Camera clicks )

17:15.492 --> 17:17.837
Just one clean shot
to the back of their heads

17:18.037 --> 17:19.209
and everything's fixed.

17:20.915 --> 17:23.634
Sorry, kids, but you've
left me no choice.

17:23.834 --> 17:25.882
Visions of heartbreak past!

17:28.464 --> 17:29.636
We're back, Mabel.

17:29.799 --> 17:31.676
We like you now.

17:31.842 --> 17:35.096
Yes. Definitely. Absolutely.

17:35.304 --> 17:37.102
Ha! You really think
we'd fall for that?

17:37.306 --> 17:38.307
( Mabel giggles )

17:38.516 --> 17:40.518
<i>Sure</i> you can all marry me!

17:40.726 --> 17:42.524
Oh! Guy from the $10 bill.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.651
I forgot
I had a crush on you.

17:44.855 --> 17:46.607
Dang it, Mabel.
They're not real.

17:46.816 --> 17:48.363
Just give us
the bottle, Mabel.

17:49.443 --> 17:51.036
Mabel, don't!

17:51.237 --> 17:52.454
It's finally done.

17:52.655 --> 17:53.907
When these idiots
see this balloon,

17:54.115 --> 17:55.537
they'll understand
that I love young people.

17:55.741 --> 17:58.119
"I heart kids."

17:58.327 --> 18:00.045
All right, let 'er rip.

18:01.163 --> 18:03.006
Oh. Oh, no!
A letter rip!

18:03.207 --> 18:04.675
What the H?!

18:05.710 --> 18:07.007
( Chatter, laughter )

18:11.549 --> 18:14.598
( screaming )
I eat kids? But we're kids!

18:14.760 --> 18:15.977
It's heaven's
punishment

18:16.178 --> 18:18.226
for our terrible
taste in everything!

18:23.519 --> 18:26.489
Mommy, is the floating
head going to eat us?

18:26.689 --> 18:27.485
Yes, Charlie!

18:27.690 --> 18:28.907
Yes, he will.

18:33.154 --> 18:35.031
Mabel, it's a trick!
Don't give him the...

18:35.239 --> 18:36.491
Gotcha!

18:37.783 --> 18:40.161
Oh!
Curse my oversized heart.

18:40.369 --> 18:42.087
Sorry, kids,
but that's what happens

18:42.288 --> 18:43.335
when you mess
with a god.

18:43.539 --> 18:45.382
Only a greater being
from the heavens themselves

18:45.583 --> 18:46.425
could possibly stop--

18:46.626 --> 18:48.003
( people screaming )

18:48.210 --> 18:49.712
It's coming down!

18:50.963 --> 18:53.136
Whoooooa!

18:58.387 --> 19:00.731
Oh, no.
I hope someone didn't die.

19:00.931 --> 19:02.683
Yes,
that would be awful.

19:02.892 --> 19:04.189
( Both laughing )

19:04.393 --> 19:05.690
What's everybody
crying about?

19:05.895 --> 19:07.989
In my day, zeppelins fell
from the sky like raindrops.

19:08.189 --> 19:09.441
It's him!

19:09.649 --> 19:11.492
The horrible old man
from the sky!

19:11.692 --> 19:13.365
( People shrieking )

19:15.446 --> 19:17.119
You know what?

19:17.281 --> 19:19.079
Being loved
by the youth is overrated.

19:19.241 --> 19:21.335
Being feared?
Now that's priceless.

19:22.370 --> 19:23.838
Love God, are you okay?

19:24.038 --> 19:25.460
Please be immortal.
Please be immortal.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.417
( Qasps )

19:27.625 --> 19:30.174
Dude.
I am so over this!

19:30.378 --> 19:31.595
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Love God to the stage.</i>

19:31.796 --> 19:33.218
<i>Love God to the stage.</i>

19:33.422 --> 19:35.390
Aagh!
Look, kid, take it, okay?

19:35.591 --> 19:37.013
Spray everyone
for all I care.

19:37.218 --> 19:38.640
You want to mess
with people's lives?

19:38.803 --> 19:40.020
You want to play God?

19:40.221 --> 19:41.473
Do it.
'Cause I'm sick of it.

19:41.639 --> 19:45.314
Medic, I need--
I need onion rings!

19:45.518 --> 19:47.316
( Band playing )

19:47.520 --> 19:49.113
Okay, Mabel,
now's our chance.

19:49.313 --> 19:51.190
They break up and the whole
friend group gets back together.

19:55.569 --> 19:56.536
Mabel!

19:57.613 --> 19:59.456
Mabel, I just wanted
to thank you.

19:59.657 --> 20:02.001
I've been so miserable
since Wendy broke up with me

20:02.159 --> 20:03.911
that I thought
my life was over.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.372
But you were right.

20:05.579 --> 20:07.001
I just needed to move on.

20:09.250 --> 20:11.878
I'm...happy?
Weird, huh?

20:12.044 --> 20:14.593
TAMBRY: Robbie, people are
commenting on our pictures.

20:17.591 --> 20:20.265
Dipper, maybe
we shouldn't do this.

20:20.469 --> 20:23.393
I mean, every time we've
played with people's fates,

20:23.597 --> 20:25.645
it's only made
things worse.

20:25.850 --> 20:28.319
They are kind of perfect
for each other,

20:28.519 --> 20:30.237
in a gross kind of way.

20:30.438 --> 20:32.031
But what about
our friend group?

20:32.231 --> 20:34.359
Well, maybe it'll
sort itself out.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.365
I mean, there's
got to be something

20:36.569 --> 20:38.571
that could bring everyone
back together.

20:38.779 --> 20:41.202
Guys, I made
a friendship cake.

20:41.365 --> 20:42.742
So let's all get
over this, okay?

20:44.201 --> 20:45.123
My cake!

20:48.164 --> 20:49.962
Hey!
Food from the outside!

20:50.166 --> 20:50.962
Ohhhh!

20:51.167 --> 20:52.214
Get him!

20:52.418 --> 20:54.091
Who!
Hey! lack-

20:54.295 --> 20:55.421
Is that Thompson?

20:55.629 --> 20:57.427
( Whistle blowing )

20:57.631 --> 20:58.803
(all laughing)
Oh, man.

20:59.008 --> 21:00.305
Yeah, fight the machine,
Thompson!

21:00.509 --> 21:02.932
Throw snacks at 'em.
Use jerky as a weapon.

21:03.137 --> 21:04.184
Thompson!

21:04.388 --> 21:05.355
ALL: Thompson!
Thompson!

21:05.556 --> 21:07.149
Thompson!
Thompson!

21:07.349 --> 21:09.192
Thompson!
Thompson!

21:09.393 --> 21:10.895
Thompson!
Thompson!

21:11.103 --> 21:12.776
Thompson!
Thompson!

21:12.980 --> 21:14.698
Thompson!
Thompson!

21:14.899 --> 21:16.401
Thompson!
Thompson...

21:24.408 --> 21:27.662
I think everything
just might be all right.

21:27.870 --> 21:30.999
Maybe someone up there really
<i>is</i> a genius matchmaker.

21:31.165 --> 21:32.508
All according to plan.

21:32.708 --> 21:33.800
