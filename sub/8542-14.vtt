WEBVTT

00:03.742 --> 00:06.745
That's the third time you've
been reprimanded in court.

00:06.832 --> 00:09.531
I bent a spoon with my mind.
What's the big deal?

00:09.618 --> 00:11.315
You were testifying
a criminal case.

00:11.402 --> 00:13.578
- You can't be playing tricks.
- It's all theater, right?

00:13.665 --> 00:14.971
Bread and circuses?

00:15.058 --> 00:18.670
Questions, Eve. Right here.

00:18.757 --> 00:20.455
[indistinct shouting]

00:20.542 --> 00:22.283
Eve!

00:22.370 --> 00:24.633
- Eve, a couple of questions.
- 'I'll handle this, Eve.'

00:24.720 --> 00:26.809
Ooh. That's Eve Mulberry.
The wine lady?

00:26.896 --> 00:29.942
- 'She grows a great cabernet.'
- What's she accused of?

00:30.030 --> 00:32.597
Killing her dance teacher.
They were lovers, I think.

00:32.684 --> 00:33.685
Scandalous.

00:33.772 --> 00:36.079
[cell phone ringing]

00:36.166 --> 00:40.083
I gotta take this. Think about
what you wanna eat. Lisbon.

00:40.170 --> 00:42.651
Deepest sympathies
for Mr. Ruiz's family.

00:42.738 --> 00:44.392
'She's expressed that
on many occasions.'

00:44.479 --> 00:46.394
[male #1]
'Eve, how you
feeling this morning?'

00:46.481 --> 00:48.570
'Are you nervous at all
about closing arguments?'

00:48.657 --> 00:50.006
Wouldn't you be?

00:50.093 --> 00:51.573
Eve's facing
a lifetime in prison

00:51.660 --> 00:53.357
'for a crime
she didn't commit.'

00:53.444 --> 00:55.881
Eve, why don't you admit
that you killed Carlos Ruiz?

00:55.968 --> 00:58.797
[male #2]
'Nice try, instead of
going for cheap reaction shots'

00:58.884 --> 01:00.756
'you should be
following my case.'

01:02.149 --> 01:04.542
[indistinct shouting]

01:29.219 --> 01:31.134
CBI. Coming through. CBI.

01:31.221 --> 01:33.223
Eve deserves praise
for her courage.

01:33.310 --> 01:37.314
CBI. Eve! CBI. Quick question.
Do you love your mom and dad?

01:37.401 --> 01:39.099
They passed away years ago.

01:39.186 --> 01:41.753
But you think fondly of them.

01:41.840 --> 01:43.015
Of course.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.454
Thank you, everyone.

01:46.541 --> 01:48.282
- 'Counsel, one more.'
- 'Eve.'

01:48.369 --> 01:49.500
[male #3]
'Eve!'

01:58.944 --> 02:01.817
Come on.

02:01.904 --> 02:05.212
[Ardiles]
The defense has tried
to paint Eve Mulberry

02:05.299 --> 02:08.476
as sweet as
the grapes she grows

02:08.563 --> 02:10.869
'but you know
the facts of this case.'

02:10.956 --> 02:13.481
[Ardiles]
'You know that
Eve was an adulterer'

02:13.568 --> 02:17.398
even though she may
deny it...and you know

02:17.485 --> 02:21.880
that her lover, Carlos,
blackmailed her for cash

02:21.967 --> 02:26.798
and when Carlos Ruiz went back
to Eve to ask for more money..

02:26.885 --> 02:30.237
...she beat his head into pulp.

02:30.324 --> 02:34.937
Eve silenced her lover to
protect her marketable image.

02:35.024 --> 02:37.505
But this..

02:37.592 --> 02:39.507
...this is the work
of the real Eve.

02:41.117 --> 02:43.598
[Ardiles]
'Take a good, long look..'

02:43.685 --> 02:45.600
'then find her guilty.'

02:51.519 --> 02:53.956
Ardiles. You got a second?

02:54.043 --> 02:55.566
For you, Jane? I got two.

02:55.653 --> 02:58.090
I'll come straight
out with it. You made a mistake.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.875
Eve Mulberry.

02:59.962 --> 03:03.270
- She isn't the killer.
- What are you playing at?

03:03.357 --> 03:05.794
I'm not playing.
I'm just observing.

03:05.881 --> 03:08.318
Eve's nonverbals
are screaming innocence

03:08.405 --> 03:10.581
and sadness for the victim.

03:10.668 --> 03:12.540
Thank you
for the observation.

03:15.107 --> 03:18.589
- She loved her mom and dad too.
- There's more?

03:18.676 --> 03:21.113
Women who murder were abused
by their parents. Not Eve.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.420
When I mentioned them,
she looked to the left

03:23.507 --> 03:25.422
she was tapped
into the brain's left side

03:25.509 --> 03:27.642
where visual
memories are stored.

03:27.729 --> 03:29.470
What if she
looked to the right?

03:29.557 --> 03:31.515
Well, she would've been
accessing her creative mind

03:31.602 --> 03:33.691
to fabricate a story.

03:33.778 --> 03:35.867
This is it?
This is all your evidence?

03:35.954 --> 03:37.695
Well, of course
there's my gut, too

03:37.782 --> 03:40.089
but I didn't think
you'd take thatvery seriously.

03:40.176 --> 03:43.223
That's the first correct
statement you've made.

03:43.310 --> 03:45.790
I bet you a million dollars
she's innocent.

03:45.877 --> 03:47.357
If I only had
the money.

03:47.444 --> 03:50.578
[chuckles]
How about a nickel?

03:50.665 --> 03:53.668
Jane, you understand this whole
conversation's pointless, right?

03:53.755 --> 03:56.366
I mean, the jury's started
deliberating. It's over.

03:56.453 --> 03:58.194
Well, the verdict
hasn't been read yet

03:58.281 --> 04:00.414
so technically,
it's still on.

04:02.894 --> 04:04.331
You know, unlike you

04:04.418 --> 04:07.159
Eve Mulberry will not
get away with murder

04:07.247 --> 04:09.945
so do us both a favor.
Don't mess with my case.

04:10.032 --> 04:12.295
Oh, I won't mess with it.

04:12.382 --> 04:13.949
I'm gonna fix it.

04:20.999 --> 04:23.393
[theme music]

04:31.009 --> 04:33.011
- There you are. We have to go.
- Where?

04:33.098 --> 04:35.623
We have to talk
to Eve Mulberry. She's innocent.

04:35.710 --> 04:37.581
Well, the jury may
feel differently.

04:37.668 --> 04:40.715
Exactly. That's why we need
to find the real killer.

04:40.802 --> 04:42.412
No. No way.

04:42.499 --> 04:44.240
We don't have time to argue.

04:44.327 --> 04:46.721
- This is not our problem.
- Justice isn't our problem?

04:46.808 --> 04:48.766
The jury has heard arguments
for three months.

04:48.853 --> 04:50.507
They're fully equipped
to determine the truth.

04:50.594 --> 04:52.117
What if they don't?

04:52.204 --> 04:54.424
An innocent woman gets punished
because you were eating.

04:54.511 --> 04:56.121
- Hey, that's my sandwich.
- Mm-hmm?

04:56.208 --> 04:57.340
Give it.

05:03.912 --> 05:06.306
[instrumental music]

05:20.885 --> 05:22.496
Can we help you?

05:22.583 --> 05:25.107
We're with the CBI.
We'd like to talk to you.

05:25.194 --> 05:27.152
No. No. No more police.

05:27.239 --> 05:29.459
These might be my wife's
last hours of freedom.

05:29.546 --> 05:31.592
We plan to spend
them alone. Thank you.

05:31.679 --> 05:34.116
Oh, what if I could offer
a lifetime of freedom?

05:35.639 --> 05:37.206
I know Eve's innocent.

05:37.293 --> 05:40.252
I'd just like
the chance to prove it.

05:40.340 --> 05:43.081
I'm sorry, whydo you
want to help me?

05:43.168 --> 05:45.649
Well, let's just say
to whom much is given

05:45.736 --> 05:48.609
much is expected. Yeah.

05:48.696 --> 05:50.959
If you don't mind,
time is a factor here.

05:51.046 --> 05:53.222
Is there somewhere
we can sit down and talk?

05:58.140 --> 06:00.316
[Peter]
'I appreciate your
interest in my wife's case'

06:00.403 --> 06:03.450
but what can you possibly do
at this stage of the game?

06:03.537 --> 06:05.539
[Peter]
There's been
hundreds of hours of testimony.

06:05.626 --> 06:08.803
[Jane]
Well, I'll let the courthouse
vultures pick over that carcass.

06:08.890 --> 06:12.023
If I'm gonna help you,
I'm gonna need fresh meat.

06:12.110 --> 06:13.764
Why did you take
dance lessons?

06:13.851 --> 06:15.418
Peter's a wonderful dancer.

06:15.505 --> 06:17.377
It was supposed
to be a surprise.

06:17.464 --> 06:19.161
We're both so busy
all the time.

06:19.248 --> 06:20.989
I thought it'd
bring us closer together.

06:21.076 --> 06:23.295
And is that
how you met Carlos Ruiz?

06:23.383 --> 06:25.167
At the dance lessons?

06:25.254 --> 06:26.864
Yeah, that's right.

06:26.951 --> 06:28.823
Ballroom, or, uh, salsa?

06:28.910 --> 06:29.867
Tango.

06:29.954 --> 06:31.129
Ah.

06:33.088 --> 06:34.829
From what I've read
in the newspapers

06:34.916 --> 06:37.527
you spent time with Carlos
outside of just the lessons.

06:37.614 --> 06:39.486
There were
phone calls, meals..

06:39.573 --> 06:41.488
Carlos and I were friends.

06:41.575 --> 06:43.359
A Stanford-educated
winemaker

06:43.446 --> 06:45.622
and a...dance instructor.

06:45.709 --> 06:48.669
Just curious, um,
what'd you talk about?

06:48.756 --> 06:52.281
I don't know. This and that.

06:52.368 --> 06:54.631
You've lied to protect your
husband's feelings, haven't you?

06:56.111 --> 06:58.113
Look at me, Eve.

06:58.200 --> 06:59.941
I know you're feeling
guilt and shame.

07:00.028 --> 07:02.247
I know what this might do
to your marriage

07:02.334 --> 07:05.294
but, uh, the way I see it,
we're your last hope.

07:05.381 --> 07:06.774
You have to trust us.

07:06.861 --> 07:09.298
Honey, w-what is
he talking about?

07:09.385 --> 07:11.387
- Why are you doing this?
- To help you.

07:11.474 --> 07:13.171
You said you believed
I was innocent.

07:13.258 --> 07:14.999
Of murder,
but you weren't hanging out

07:15.086 --> 07:16.784
with your sexy dance teacher

07:16.871 --> 07:19.874
for the stimulating chitchat.
You were attracted to him.

07:19.961 --> 07:22.442
You danced the tango
with the man, for God sakes.

07:22.529 --> 07:24.008
I did not have an affair.

07:24.095 --> 07:25.793
That was a non-contracted
denial.

07:25.880 --> 07:28.752
Truth tellers use contractions.
"I didn't have an affair."

07:28.839 --> 07:31.276
This isn't the woman
I saw on the courthouse steps.

07:31.363 --> 07:33.017
I think that you should leave.

07:42.200 --> 07:44.072
It's like a band-aid, Eve.

07:45.726 --> 07:47.858
Best to just
tear it off quickly.

07:54.604 --> 07:56.258
It was just a few times.

07:57.868 --> 07:59.435
Are you kidding me?

07:59.522 --> 08:00.828
I'm s..

08:00.915 --> 08:02.220
I'm so sorry.

08:05.136 --> 08:07.095
Peter, you're so busy.
You're always traveling.

08:07.182 --> 08:10.098
- I know that's not an excuse.
- You stay away from me now.

08:12.796 --> 08:14.276
What's going on?

08:14.363 --> 08:17.192
Eve just admitted
to sleeping with Carlos.

08:17.279 --> 08:18.759
Oh.

08:18.846 --> 08:20.151
I'm sorry I missed that.

08:21.544 --> 08:23.328
And sorry,
who are these people?

08:23.415 --> 08:25.809
CBI. They're here to help.

08:25.896 --> 08:28.116
This is my best friend,
my business partner, Amy

08:28.203 --> 08:30.901
and that's
my little sister Gretchen.

08:30.988 --> 08:34.470
What about the blackmail?
You were sleeping with Carlos.

08:34.557 --> 08:36.080
- Did you pay him off?
- 'No.'

08:36.167 --> 08:38.822
He asked for a loan,
but I didn't give it.

08:38.909 --> 08:41.259
- What was the money for?
- A business opportunity.

08:41.346 --> 08:43.087
[Eve]
'I didn't really want to know.'

08:46.917 --> 08:48.832
What are you
still doing here?

08:48.919 --> 08:50.791
I mean,
besides brooding.

08:53.402 --> 08:55.230
Pardon me?

08:55.317 --> 08:58.407
Your wife dropped a bomb on you
and you're still standing.

08:58.494 --> 09:02.106
If it were me, I'd be
out of here by now..

09:02.193 --> 09:05.588
...unless, of course,
I suspected the, uh..

09:05.675 --> 09:07.416
...affair all along.

09:07.503 --> 09:09.592
Why would I hide
my suspicions?

09:09.679 --> 09:11.246
Make yourself look good.

09:11.333 --> 09:12.639
He's right.

09:12.726 --> 09:14.423
If you had knowledge
of the affair

09:14.510 --> 09:16.207
it would make you
a prime suspect.

09:16.294 --> 09:18.775
- I didn't kill anyone.
- You used a contraction.

09:18.862 --> 09:23.475
That's a hopeful sign, but I'll
keep an eye on you and you, Amy.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.000
- Me?
- Eve confides in you.

09:26.087 --> 09:28.568
She told you about the affair,
the best friend thing

09:28.655 --> 09:30.744
unlike Gretchen.
She had no idea.

09:30.831 --> 09:33.529
You do have issues with
your sister, though, don't you?

09:33.616 --> 09:35.879
Duh. Like there are sisters
who don'thave issues.

09:35.966 --> 09:37.925
I thought you said
these people were helping.

09:38.012 --> 09:41.537
We are, and I'd say we're off
to a pretty solid start.

09:41.624 --> 09:43.931
I think we need
some time alone.

09:44.018 --> 09:45.410
[Lisbon]
We'll keep in touch.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.114
[Rigsby]
'According to
the court transcript'

09:53.201 --> 09:56.291
there was a cash deposit
for $20,000 paid

09:56.378 --> 09:58.859
into Carlos Ruiz's bank account
the week of his death.

09:58.946 --> 10:01.383
If we're taking Eve's word,
she didn't give him that.

10:01.470 --> 10:03.515
He could've been involved
with something illegal.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.300
Peter thought she was
having an affair?

10:05.387 --> 10:07.911
Jane thinks so. It puts him
on the suspect list.

10:07.998 --> 10:09.826
Peter Mulberry runs
a boutique investment firm.

10:09.913 --> 10:11.393
Told the police
he was dinning

10:11.480 --> 10:13.221
at his employee's homes
the murder night.

10:13.308 --> 10:15.179
- The employee vouched for him.
- Dig deeper.

10:15.266 --> 10:17.268
Who was the employee?
Do we trust him?

10:17.355 --> 10:18.922
- Her.
- Exactly.

10:19.009 --> 10:21.185
Don't know how we'll
get around the murder weapon.

10:21.272 --> 10:22.709
[Kimball]
'That's a cutter mattock.'

10:22.796 --> 10:24.580
Used for digging trenches
and cutting roots.

10:24.667 --> 10:27.235
It's from Eve's vineyard. Her
fingerprints were all over it.

10:27.322 --> 10:29.803
All this tells me is that
Eve might've been framed.

10:29.890 --> 10:32.588
Make a list of anybody
who held a grudge against her.

10:32.675 --> 10:34.721
Also look back
into Ruiz's phone records.

10:34.808 --> 10:37.201
The original work from the
detectives looks a bit thin.

10:38.942 --> 10:41.597
I know that this isn't
an official case, so thank you.

10:43.207 --> 10:44.948
We're heading
to the crime scene.

10:45.035 --> 10:47.124
Let me know
if you find anything out

10:47.211 --> 10:49.605
and work fast, guys.
The jury's out.

10:59.180 --> 11:00.921
[female #1]
'I ain't going anywhere.'

11:01.008 --> 11:03.445
You know what?
Shut up! Get back in the house!

11:03.532 --> 11:05.229
[female #1]
'Don't you walk away!'

11:05.316 --> 11:07.667
[indistinct shouting]

11:11.540 --> 11:13.063
Murder was months ago.

11:13.150 --> 11:15.239
What kinda evidence
do you expect to find?

11:15.326 --> 11:17.067
I'll know it when I see it.

11:17.154 --> 11:18.329
Okay.

11:20.767 --> 11:23.160
[intense music]

11:38.828 --> 11:40.482
[knock on door]

11:40.569 --> 11:42.179
[Lisbon]
'CBI. Open up.'

11:44.399 --> 11:46.531
'Hello, police,
open up.'

11:49.578 --> 11:51.101
What do you want?

11:51.188 --> 11:54.017
Uh, w-were you
just watching me?

11:54.104 --> 11:58.848
No, I wasn't.

11:58.935 --> 12:00.023
[knock on door]

12:02.939 --> 12:05.333
Step away from
the door, blondie.

12:05.420 --> 12:07.988
Yeah, easy,
I-I-I'm-I'm with the CBI.

12:08.075 --> 12:10.338
Do you think
I could come in?

12:18.868 --> 12:20.565
"Consultant?"

12:20.652 --> 12:22.872
What makes you think
I'd want a consultant here?

12:22.959 --> 12:25.919
Well, how about a real cop?
I got one across the street.

12:26.006 --> 12:27.355
[knock on door]

12:27.442 --> 12:30.184
She'll be knocking all day.

12:30.271 --> 12:32.186
Go get her.
I'll put on the kettle.

12:34.405 --> 12:35.755
[whistles]
Lisbon!

12:39.280 --> 12:41.673
[indistinct chattering]

12:57.428 --> 13:00.823
- Back still hurting, huh?
- I got hit by a car, so yeah.

13:00.910 --> 13:02.869
You should lay off
those pills.

13:02.956 --> 13:04.522
You ever tried yoga?

13:04.609 --> 13:07.047
My neighbor teaches it.
I can get you her number.

13:07.134 --> 13:08.657
[sighs]
No, thanks.

13:08.744 --> 13:10.572
Okay.

13:10.659 --> 13:12.008
Let me know, yeah?

13:17.144 --> 13:18.275
[gunshot]

13:19.886 --> 13:20.843
[gunshot]

13:20.930 --> 13:22.105
Detective Silva?

13:22.192 --> 13:25.195
That's right.

13:25.282 --> 13:27.632
I'm Agent Van Pelt.
This is Agent Rigsby.

13:27.719 --> 13:29.069
We're with the CBI.

13:29.156 --> 13:32.289
Hey. How you doing?
Nice to meet you.

13:32.376 --> 13:34.596
We've been looking
at your files on Eve Mulberry.

13:37.120 --> 13:40.341
Oh, yeah?
That was some work, that case.

13:40.428 --> 13:41.864
- Jury come back yet?
- No.

13:41.951 --> 13:43.257
They're still
deliberating.

13:43.344 --> 13:46.216
Eh, no worries.
That loon will get hers.

13:46.303 --> 13:49.524
I love to watch the rich ones
fall, you know what I mean?

13:49.611 --> 13:53.441
We were hoping you could help us
run down some information.

13:53.528 --> 13:55.008
Yeah, sure.
What do you need?

13:55.095 --> 13:56.705
Did you interview
a Conner Reilly?

13:56.792 --> 13:59.751
Records state that Reilly spoke
with Carlos on the murder day.

13:59.839 --> 14:03.538
Reilly...I don't remember.
What does my report say?

14:03.625 --> 14:05.496
There's no notes on him.

14:05.583 --> 14:07.107
Reilly.

14:07.194 --> 14:08.499
Yeah. I remember.

14:08.586 --> 14:10.284
We checked him out.
He looked clean.

14:10.371 --> 14:12.373
Reilly had an alibi
for the murder night?

14:12.460 --> 14:14.418
I guess. I don't recall.

14:14.505 --> 14:17.508
You never talked
to him, did you?

14:17.595 --> 14:19.293
What you getting on me for?

14:19.380 --> 14:21.773
We called Reilly.
He didn't call back.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.864
We were on Eve Mulberry by then.
Reilly didn't have a record.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.604
No, no record,
no employment history

14:26.691 --> 14:28.432
Facebook page,
not much of anything, really.

14:28.519 --> 14:30.870
We tried calling Reilly but
his phone's been disconnected.

14:30.957 --> 14:33.611
- It's like he never existed.
- What is your issue here?

14:33.698 --> 14:35.309
This case
has already been tried.

14:35.396 --> 14:37.441
We think Eve Mulberry
might be innocent.

14:37.528 --> 14:38.747
Yeah? And why is that?

14:38.834 --> 14:39.879
We have our reasons.

14:39.966 --> 14:41.576
[chuckles]

14:41.663 --> 14:44.492
It's that nut-job psychic
you guys work with, right?

14:44.579 --> 14:46.886
Janet or Jane.

14:46.973 --> 14:50.019
- He's showboating again, right?
- I feel sorry for you guys.

14:50.106 --> 14:52.543
You're like, uh,
stooges in a comedy act.

14:52.630 --> 14:54.328
- Yeah, he's not a psychic.
- Yeah, whatever.

14:54.415 --> 14:55.895
Do you have
anything on Reilly?

14:55.982 --> 14:58.158
Anything at all
that might help us find him?

14:58.245 --> 15:00.029
Oh, let me think.

15:00.116 --> 15:02.858
No. Sorry.

15:02.945 --> 15:05.165
- Hey!
- Hey! I'm sorry.

15:11.649 --> 15:14.261
[Lisbon]
'So you're home here
a lot, Mrs. Williams?'

15:14.348 --> 15:17.307
[Williams]
'I am retired,
so, yes, I am.'

15:17.394 --> 15:19.309
[Lisbon]
And, um..

15:19.396 --> 15:21.833
were you home the night
that your neighbor was murdered?

15:25.663 --> 15:27.927
I can see you've
lived here a long time

15:28.014 --> 15:30.233
and you like to
keep an eye on things.

15:30.320 --> 15:33.933
- Tell us what you saw.
- What are you doing over there?

15:34.020 --> 15:36.631
- Admiring your lovely home.
- Oh.

15:36.718 --> 15:39.112
Do you have help keeping,
uh, things so tidy?

15:39.199 --> 15:43.203
No, I do not.
Do I look like an invalid?

15:43.290 --> 15:45.640
Gloria. Why don't you
tell us what you saw?

15:45.727 --> 15:47.947
I'll tell you what
I told the other police

15:48.034 --> 15:50.732
stomping through my house.
I saw nothing.

15:50.819 --> 15:53.082
- Okay, Lisbon. Let's go.
- I'm not done.

15:53.169 --> 15:55.128
She's won't talk.
Look at her. She's scared.

15:55.215 --> 15:57.652
That's why she hides
behind the curtains all day.

15:57.739 --> 16:00.916
I'm not hiding from anyone.
I keep vigil over my house.

16:01.003 --> 16:02.744
Well, there's no shame
in being afraid.

16:02.831 --> 16:05.007
Old age can be
a terrifying time of life.

16:05.094 --> 16:06.791
You're right. We should go.

16:06.878 --> 16:10.056
Yes, thank you very much for
your time, ma'am. Thank you.

16:10.143 --> 16:11.579
I saw someone.

16:11.666 --> 16:13.102
-Oh.
- Ooh.

16:13.189 --> 16:16.540
I saw, uh, a woman
the night that Mexican..

16:16.627 --> 16:18.890
The Latino boy was murdered.

16:18.978 --> 16:22.111
She went into the house, and
then minutes later, she ran out.

16:22.198 --> 16:24.200
Can you describe her?

16:24.287 --> 16:28.030
She had a tote bag.
She was slim build.

16:28.117 --> 16:30.032
She had blonde hair,
long blonde hair.

16:32.208 --> 16:34.558
She look like this?
Eve mulberry?

16:34.645 --> 16:37.170
Yes, that's her.
Exactly. So there.

16:47.615 --> 16:50.313
We can't quit now. I don't care
what the neighbor said.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.489
An eyewitness identified
Eve as the killer.

16:52.576 --> 16:54.535
Did you see a single
working clock there?

16:54.622 --> 16:56.145
A wristwatch,
an alarm, anything?

16:56.232 --> 16:57.799
No. So?

16:57.886 --> 17:00.628
She lives cooped up here
with no sense of the time.

17:00.715 --> 17:03.761
She probably confused the night
of the murder with another one.

17:03.848 --> 17:05.328
So you're saying
she's flat-out wrong?

17:05.415 --> 17:07.026
I'm just saying
Eve is innocent.

17:07.113 --> 17:09.289
I need evidence to
keep the team on this.

17:09.376 --> 17:10.638
We got a lead.

17:10.725 --> 17:13.075
The victim talked
to a Conner Reilly

17:13.162 --> 17:15.338
but Reilly was using
a phony social security number.

17:15.425 --> 17:16.644
- It's an alias.
- Who for?

17:16.731 --> 17:18.298
This guy. Terry Murphy.

17:18.385 --> 17:21.388
He came over on a tourist visa
two years ago from Ireland.

17:21.475 --> 17:23.651
[Rigsby]
'He's a tech scammer, internet
fraud, identity creation.'

17:23.738 --> 17:25.435
He's violent.
He's been a murder suspect.

17:25.522 --> 17:27.176
Ask, and you shall receive.

17:27.263 --> 17:28.917
One of our CIs
has contacts there.

17:29.004 --> 17:30.527
She's asking around now.

17:32.747 --> 17:35.967
- Okay. We keep working.
- We should talk to Eve again.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.274
Maybe she knows what was
going on with Murphy.

17:38.361 --> 17:40.755
- Maybe.
- You're the boss on this one.

17:40.842 --> 17:42.931
- Okay, don't be like that.
- Like what?

17:43.018 --> 17:44.367
It's what you want.

17:44.454 --> 17:47.022
What I want
is a little smile.

17:47.109 --> 17:51.679
Well, you can't
have everything.

17:51.766 --> 17:53.768
I checked out
the employee that was dining

17:53.855 --> 17:56.162
with the husband
on the murder night.

17:56.249 --> 17:58.164
And after the wife's
murder trial started

17:58.251 --> 18:00.427
Peter Mulberry gave
the woman a huge promotion.

18:00.514 --> 18:02.646
Suddenly she's
the company's youngest V.P.

18:02.733 --> 18:05.301
- He bribed her for the alibi?
- Maybe. I'll keep digging.

18:05.388 --> 18:06.520
Alright.

18:13.657 --> 18:14.832
Summer. Welcome back.

18:16.443 --> 18:18.358
I'm not gonna say
that I'm thebest

18:18.445 --> 18:20.273
confidential informant ever

18:20.360 --> 18:22.579
but I am pretty
high up on the list.

18:22.666 --> 18:23.885
What do you have?

18:23.972 --> 18:25.800
This girl
I used to hustle with..

18:25.887 --> 18:29.064
...she's now into identify
theft. She knows Murphy.

18:29.151 --> 18:31.110
I said that I had
some stolen information

18:31.197 --> 18:33.155
to sell
and she made a call.

18:33.242 --> 18:36.376
- Can she set up a meet?
- Already done.

18:36.463 --> 18:39.118
Murphy will be at the Grafton
Street tavern in an hour.

18:43.034 --> 18:44.993
Is it me,
or do you look impressed?

18:45.080 --> 18:47.778
No, it's just you. We'll have
Summer wait at the bar.

18:47.865 --> 18:49.606
When Murphy arrives,
we'll scoop him up.

18:49.693 --> 18:52.827
If Summer gets Murphy to make an
offer that'd give us leverage.

18:52.914 --> 18:55.221
I could do that.

18:55.308 --> 18:56.787
It'll cost you extra.

18:56.874 --> 18:59.529
All we have to do
is fit her with a wire.

19:02.358 --> 19:03.707
Okay.

19:03.794 --> 19:05.535
Just get him
to make the offer.

19:05.622 --> 19:08.625
Excuse yourself to the bathroom.
That's it. Then we move in.

19:08.712 --> 19:10.671
Okay.

19:10.758 --> 19:13.195
Make the deal, hit the can.
Done and done.

19:13.282 --> 19:16.633
That'll be $500,
$800 if I make the case.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.200
I'll wire you up.

19:33.650 --> 19:35.086
You again?

19:35.174 --> 19:37.088
Uh, we're looking for Eve.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.916
She just took
a walk with Amy

19:39.003 --> 19:40.831
you might wanna
give her a minute.

19:40.918 --> 19:43.182
Eve and Peter just had
an epic throw-down.

19:43.269 --> 19:46.010
The waterworks
were ridiculous.

19:46.097 --> 19:49.144
Okay. Well, you think
I can sample the goods?

19:49.231 --> 19:50.363
Yeah, sure.

19:57.065 --> 19:59.328
That is our new cab.

19:59.415 --> 20:01.243
New to the business?

20:01.330 --> 20:02.984
Is it that obvious?

20:03.071 --> 20:05.595
You poured red wine
in a white wine glass.

20:05.682 --> 20:07.118
Oh, well.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.860
Yeah, I'm just helping out
here during the trial.

20:09.947 --> 20:11.906
You don't own
a piece of the action?

20:11.993 --> 20:16.606
Uh, no. The wine company belongs
to my sister and her BFF.

20:16.693 --> 20:18.478
And who owns
the private villa?

20:18.565 --> 20:21.785
Eve won that jackpot
when she married Peter.

20:21.872 --> 20:24.527
All the land
belongs to him, so..

20:24.614 --> 20:26.790
Gretchen,
that glass is wrong.

20:26.877 --> 20:28.531
Your shoes are wrong

20:28.618 --> 20:30.533
'but you don't see me
complaining about it.'

20:30.620 --> 20:32.274
We've talked about this.

20:32.361 --> 20:35.930
There's a reason investors
are knocking down the door.

20:36.017 --> 20:38.106
It's an attention to detail.

20:38.193 --> 20:41.892
Thank you. You haven't
taken any of the offers?

20:41.979 --> 20:44.025
We go back
and forth about it.

20:44.112 --> 20:46.114
From a business standpoint,
it makes sense.

20:46.201 --> 20:49.335
But we don't want to be one of
those giant corporate vineyards

20:49.422 --> 20:51.902
because then it wouldn't
be about the wine.

20:51.989 --> 20:55.297
Yes, it's beautifully earthy,
with, uh..

20:55.384 --> 20:57.212
...a hint of acid.

20:57.299 --> 20:59.823
Do you notice
the tobacco note at the end?

20:59.910 --> 21:02.826
- The cab's my favorite.
- Ah, yes. Mmm.

21:02.913 --> 21:05.742
I'm sorry, could we speak
to Eve alone for a moment?

21:05.829 --> 21:07.048
Gretchen, let's go.

21:07.135 --> 21:08.267
Gladly.

21:12.314 --> 21:14.273
Do you recognize this man?

21:15.839 --> 21:17.493
No.

21:17.580 --> 21:19.147
[Eve]
'Should I?'

21:19.234 --> 21:21.976
His name's Terry Murphy.
He's a known criminal.

21:22.063 --> 21:25.109
Carlos was in touch with him
the day of his murder.

21:25.196 --> 21:27.068
Oh, my,
what kind of criminal?

21:27.155 --> 21:28.809
[Lisbon]
'He's into
identity theft mostly'

21:28.896 --> 21:32.247
but he's also done some illegal
surveillance and wiretapping.

21:32.334 --> 21:34.728
What did Carlos have
to do with him?

21:34.815 --> 21:36.730
Well, we were hoping
you'd tell us.

21:36.817 --> 21:40.560
I wish I could, but this is good
news, right? This could help us.

21:40.647 --> 21:43.780
I feel like the jury's gonna
walk outta that room any minute.

21:43.867 --> 21:45.652
We're doing
everything we can.

21:45.739 --> 21:47.915
Yeah. Very good. Thank you.

21:51.527 --> 21:53.747
Do you realize,
every single time I deal

21:53.834 --> 21:56.184
with your people,
things go to hell?

21:56.271 --> 21:58.969
Osvaldo. Come in. Sit down.

21:59.056 --> 22:02.277
Is there something in the water
here? I need to know.

22:02.364 --> 22:04.627
I need to know
why your team is interfering

22:04.714 --> 22:06.803
with a state murder trial.

22:06.890 --> 22:08.762
I understand your anger.

22:08.849 --> 22:10.633
No, you don't.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.505
The state has spent
millions of dollars

22:12.592 --> 22:14.028
not to mention
thousands of man-hours

22:14.115 --> 22:15.638
prosecuting this case.

22:15.725 --> 22:18.815
- And yet evidence was missed.
- What evidence?

22:18.902 --> 22:21.252
The victim was in contact
with a violent criminal

22:21.340 --> 22:23.994
the day of his murder.
That doesn't concern you?

22:24.081 --> 22:25.474
No.

22:25.561 --> 22:27.520
No, that's the concern
of an appeals court

22:27.607 --> 22:30.349
if Mrs. Mulberry believes
that her due process was denied.

22:30.436 --> 22:34.048
An appeals court. How long will
she have to spend in prison?

22:34.135 --> 22:36.050
If she's innocent,
she deserves our help.

22:38.269 --> 22:41.272
You want to know
why Jane took this case?

22:41.360 --> 22:44.232
Because Eve loved her parents.

22:44.319 --> 22:46.190
That's crazy, right?

22:46.277 --> 22:48.236
I thought there was
something in the water

22:48.323 --> 22:50.804
but I can see
the problem now.

22:50.891 --> 22:52.022
It's you.

23:02.772 --> 23:05.166
[rock music]

23:08.604 --> 23:11.651
Testing, testing, one, two.
Kimball Cho's a wallaby.

23:28.885 --> 23:30.017
[Kimball]
'Here's Murphy.'

23:36.937 --> 23:38.068
[male #4]
'Beer?'

23:42.246 --> 23:43.639
Summer, is it?

23:43.726 --> 23:44.858
It is.

23:47.295 --> 23:50.603
What do you got for me, girly?

23:50.690 --> 23:52.605
A long list of numbers.

23:52.692 --> 23:55.129
Social security, credit cards,
driver's license.

23:55.216 --> 23:58.349
- About a hundred of each.
- Where do you get 'em?

23:58.437 --> 24:01.048
Clients, the kinds
with high credit limits.

24:01.135 --> 24:04.312
Won't know it hits them
till it's too late.

24:04.399 --> 24:06.445
What sort of business you in?

24:06.532 --> 24:09.273
[Summer]
'I'm a working girl.'

24:09.360 --> 24:10.927
[Murphy chuckles]

24:11.014 --> 24:12.189
Bang on.

24:14.365 --> 24:17.020
You know, a little of your
honey would sweeten the pot.

24:19.327 --> 24:20.763
$5,000 for the information.

24:20.850 --> 24:23.505
Are you touched? Not here.

24:31.208 --> 24:33.080
Wait. Let it play out.

24:44.961 --> 24:47.268
Five thousand ain't gonna
happen, sunshine.

24:47.355 --> 24:49.792
You'll get three.
That's the rate.

24:49.879 --> 24:51.446
That's it. Let's move.

24:54.014 --> 24:57.060
[Summer]
'How do I know I can trust you?'

24:57.147 --> 25:00.237
[Murphy]
'You're questioning me?'

25:00.324 --> 25:04.198
My name is my word.
Ask anyone I do business with.

25:04.285 --> 25:07.331
Some friends of mine said that
you worked with Carlos Ruiz.

25:07.418 --> 25:11.335
I'd ask him about you,
but...he's dead.

25:11.422 --> 25:14.338
She's trying to make our case.

25:14.425 --> 25:16.036
[Murphy]
'Well, now..'

25:16.123 --> 25:18.517
You've got spirit,
I'll give you that.

25:18.604 --> 25:22.042
[sighs]
You think so?
I was trying to act tough.

25:22.129 --> 25:23.696
You never know
in these situations.

25:23.783 --> 25:26.002
[both chuckle]

25:26.089 --> 25:28.048
So what's the deal
with Carlos?

25:28.135 --> 25:30.006
- Carlos?
- Yeah.

25:30.093 --> 25:33.227
He had some plan to install
ATM skimmers in strip clubs.

25:33.314 --> 25:34.881
Nice enough plan..

25:34.968 --> 25:37.927
...got me to invest
20 grand in it..

25:38.014 --> 25:41.104
Which he then spent
on strippers and booze.

25:41.191 --> 25:43.454
So what'd you do?

25:43.542 --> 25:44.847
What did Ido?

25:44.934 --> 25:47.154
- Let's go.
- Just give her a minute.

25:47.241 --> 25:48.808
[Summer]
'Yeah.'

25:48.895 --> 25:51.288
'You didn't just let him
steal from you, did you?'

25:54.422 --> 25:55.641
[gasps]

25:55.728 --> 25:58.644
What's that to do
with you? Hmm?

25:58.731 --> 26:00.602
Let go.

26:00.689 --> 26:03.257
Where's that
list of numbers?

26:03.344 --> 26:06.826
- Stop it.
- I want to see it now.

26:06.913 --> 26:07.870
[door thuds]

26:07.957 --> 26:10.003
Police! Don't move!

26:12.179 --> 26:13.572
[both grunt]

26:13.659 --> 26:14.790
[Kimball]
Hey!

26:19.578 --> 26:22.015
[Rigsby]
'Give me your hands.
Hands behind your back.'

26:22.102 --> 26:23.233
You alright?

26:28.282 --> 26:30.240
You owe me $800.

26:32.721 --> 26:33.853
Come on.

26:39.032 --> 26:40.424
So a jury's deliberating
this case as we speak

26:40.511 --> 26:42.513
and the $20,000
in Ruiz's bank account

26:42.601 --> 26:45.429
is a key piece of evidence,
you gave it to him.

26:45.516 --> 26:48.128
That's right. So what?

26:48.215 --> 26:51.697
So I think you killed Carlos
because he lost your money.

26:51.784 --> 26:53.437
That would be foolish.

26:53.524 --> 26:57.659
If I killed him, I wouldn't
get it back, now, would I?

26:57.746 --> 27:00.706
Don't mind me. Rigsby,
I brought you a cup of tea.

27:00.793 --> 27:02.882
Uh, no, I'm good.
Thank you.

27:02.969 --> 27:06.102
Oh. No good deed
goes unpunished. Uh, you?

27:14.067 --> 27:16.025
Yous both seem
like agreeable men.

27:19.420 --> 27:21.640
Can't we find a reasonable
solution to this problem?

27:21.727 --> 27:23.903
Something that's
beneficial to all of us?

27:23.990 --> 27:27.123
- He's trying to bribe us.
- Yeah, sounds like it to me.

27:27.210 --> 27:30.997
Your words,
not mine...but..

27:31.084 --> 27:32.738
...now you come to mention it..

27:32.825 --> 27:35.305
...I do believe that everyone
has their price point.

27:37.090 --> 27:39.483
What are you willing to pay?

27:39.570 --> 27:42.573
If I'm out within the hour,
five grand to each of ya.

27:42.661 --> 27:45.098
You killed a man.
You're not bribing your way out.

27:45.185 --> 27:47.143
Certainly not
for 5 grand, anyhow.

27:47.230 --> 27:50.059
I killed no man.

27:50.146 --> 27:52.235
I deal in information,
not murder.

27:52.322 --> 27:56.283
Yes, fake IDs, right?
Um..

27:56.370 --> 27:58.764
How do the, uh,
fake identity things work?

27:58.851 --> 28:01.114
- I always wanted to know.
- I'll explain it later.

28:01.201 --> 28:03.986
Could you explain it now?
I mean, he's not gonna talk.

28:04.073 --> 28:07.381
I understand it's a matter of
making a phony credit profile.

28:07.468 --> 28:08.774
- 'That's all?'
- 'Yeah, that's all.'

28:08.861 --> 28:10.645
If you were a hack,
that's all.

28:10.732 --> 28:14.736
Well, what if you're not a hack?
How do you go about it then?

28:14.823 --> 28:17.217
Huh? Theoretically speaking.

28:21.438 --> 28:27.270
True identity farming is an art
that takes decades to set up.

28:27.357 --> 28:29.490
You invent children.

28:29.577 --> 28:31.492
Set up bank accounts
for them

28:31.579 --> 28:34.974
file tax returns,
register them as voters

28:35.061 --> 28:39.674
and then, years later,
you have the perfect identities

28:39.761 --> 28:43.765
ready and waiting
for real people to step into.

28:43.852 --> 28:45.419
That's it?

28:45.506 --> 28:47.203
There's a cd
full of personal information

28:47.290 --> 28:50.511
you have to fill out
first, but, uh..

28:50.598 --> 28:51.686
Yeah, that's it.

28:53.557 --> 28:58.606
And how much would one charge
for this, uh, particular..

28:58.693 --> 29:01.304
'...thing? Theoretically.'

29:01.391 --> 29:04.307
Well, now, we're talking
top of the line here.

29:04.394 --> 29:06.135
Mm-hmm.

29:06.222 --> 29:08.616
Two hundred thousand
for a brand-new you.

29:08.703 --> 29:10.879
I'll get back to the
interrogation, if that's okay?

29:10.966 --> 29:13.360
Yeah, by all means.

29:13.447 --> 29:17.016
[Lisbon]
'Alright.
Thanks for the heads-up.'

29:17.103 --> 29:19.496
Bad news. That was
a friend from the courthouse.

29:19.583 --> 29:22.456
The jury didn't order dinner.
They're closing in on a verdict.

29:22.543 --> 29:25.198
Hmm. We need to hustle.

29:25.285 --> 29:28.375
Call Eve, have her come in
tell her you wanna update her.

29:28.462 --> 29:31.030
- I'm springing Murphy.
- No. He's our prime suspect.

29:31.117 --> 29:32.988
He didn't kill Carlos,
that doesn't mean

29:33.075 --> 29:35.034
he can't be useful to us.
Uh...yeah.

29:35.121 --> 29:37.297
Video surveillance equipment.
Those little cameras?

29:37.384 --> 29:39.865
- I'm gonna need a few.
- Mind telling me one thing?

29:39.952 --> 29:40.953
Like what I'm planning?

29:41.040 --> 29:42.476
Yeah, that would be super.

29:42.563 --> 29:43.651
[chuckles]

29:43.738 --> 29:44.870
No?

29:47.350 --> 29:49.396
You're annoyed
I didn't stick to the agenda

29:49.483 --> 29:52.921
but all's well that
ends well. We're a team.

29:53.008 --> 29:55.184
Stuff happens,
and, uh, we move on.

30:03.323 --> 30:05.542
[sighs]
We're not a team.

30:05.629 --> 30:07.414
Sign that.

30:07.501 --> 30:09.590
Here's your final payment.

30:09.677 --> 30:11.157
"Final payment?"

30:11.244 --> 30:13.812
You were reckless and put
everyone in danger today.

30:13.899 --> 30:16.075
If I can't trust you,
I can't use you.

30:18.991 --> 30:21.297
So what, that's it?
You're done with me?

30:22.908 --> 30:24.039
Yes.

30:33.832 --> 30:36.704
Oh, you're back
for more, are you?

30:36.791 --> 30:39.533
Do me a favor
and get us another cup of cha

30:39.620 --> 30:41.883
with a bit of sugar
in it this time.

30:41.970 --> 30:45.191
Get it yourself.
I pulled in a favor.

30:45.278 --> 30:46.845
You're a free man..

30:46.932 --> 30:48.847
...under one condition.

30:51.371 --> 30:53.329
I need a new identity.

30:58.378 --> 30:59.945
Do you, now?

31:00.032 --> 31:02.512
Well, you wanted to know
my price point. That's it.

31:02.599 --> 31:04.340
And I expect
a friends-and-family discount

31:04.427 --> 31:06.647
from your usual fee.

31:06.734 --> 31:08.867
How do I know
this isn't entrapment?

31:08.954 --> 31:11.870
You don't, but try this.

31:11.957 --> 31:14.524
You get me a new identity
or I'll book you

31:14.611 --> 31:17.310
for receiving
stolen information.

31:17.397 --> 31:20.269
That should be enough to get you
extradited back to Ireland

31:20.356 --> 31:23.272
where you're wanted in
connection with two homicides..

31:23.359 --> 31:25.231
...or is that three?

31:30.062 --> 31:32.281
I'll do it for $100,000.

31:33.935 --> 31:37.112
Okay, I'm in a tight spot.
How quickly can you work?

31:37.199 --> 31:39.158
How quick can you
fill out the forms?

31:39.245 --> 31:41.377
The cd, right.
When do I get that?

31:41.464 --> 31:43.075
One hour.

31:43.162 --> 31:46.165
There's a parking lot at
the south end of Fourth Street.

31:46.252 --> 31:49.559
I'll meet you at the bottom
with the cd, but..

31:49.646 --> 31:52.562
'...I'll need a deposit
to get me started.'

31:52.649 --> 31:53.824
'Ten thousand.'

31:55.696 --> 31:57.654
I'll send a courier.

32:05.880 --> 32:07.621
As long as they've the cash.

32:07.708 --> 32:09.231
Just don't be late.

32:11.538 --> 32:12.669
[indistinct chattering]

32:14.541 --> 32:16.673
- We're gonna have a contest.
- For what?

32:16.760 --> 32:18.458
See who has
the best Irish accent.

32:18.545 --> 32:22.679
Rigsby, you're up first.
Don't argue. We don't have time.

32:22.766 --> 32:26.335
[clears throat]
I, um..

32:26.422 --> 32:28.033
[Irish accent]
My name's Wayne Rigsby.

32:28.120 --> 32:31.166
Why I'm talking with
an Irish accent right now, I..

32:31.253 --> 32:33.473
...don't really know.

32:33.560 --> 32:36.737
Uh, okay. Cho?

32:36.824 --> 32:38.391
- No.
- Oh, come on.

32:38.478 --> 32:40.654
We know you have
all sorts of hidden talents.

32:42.786 --> 32:44.571
Rigsby it is, then.

32:44.658 --> 32:46.399
Uh, practice learning this.

32:52.579 --> 32:54.494
- Did you get those cameras?
- Yeah.

32:56.235 --> 32:57.758
Good man. Thank you.

33:00.804 --> 33:03.198
How are you two holding up?

33:03.285 --> 33:04.808
Things have been better.

33:04.895 --> 33:08.377
Lisbon, look at these.

33:08.464 --> 33:10.162
What are those?

33:11.990 --> 33:13.774
Wireless surveillance cameras.

33:13.861 --> 33:16.429
The new owner of Carlos' house
was replastering the ceiling.

33:16.516 --> 33:17.778
He found 'em
hidden everywhere.

33:17.865 --> 33:19.301
Murphy was
a surveillance expert.

33:19.388 --> 33:21.260
And Carlos owed
Murphy lots of money.

33:21.347 --> 33:24.785
Well, maybe Murphy installed
the cameras to keep tabs on him.

33:24.872 --> 33:27.483
Not "maybe."
We traced the serial numbers.

33:27.570 --> 33:30.356
They were bought by one of
Murphy's established aliases.

33:30.443 --> 33:33.228
If those were in the ceiling, it
could've recorded the murders.

33:33.315 --> 33:35.404
Murphy might have
evidence on the real killer.

33:35.491 --> 33:37.841
- It's possible.
- A bit of a long shot, right?

33:37.928 --> 33:39.582
I'd say it's our only shot.

33:39.669 --> 33:42.150
We just released Murphy.
I'm gonna bring him back in.

33:42.237 --> 33:44.761
Yeah, I'm sorry.
You're gonna have to leave now.

33:44.848 --> 33:47.155
- Of course. Thank you so much.
- Yeah, thank you.

33:51.246 --> 33:53.074
- Well done.
- I try.

33:56.556 --> 33:59.124
[Irish accent]
"Listen. Listen.
Do not interrupt."

33:59.211 --> 34:00.777
Ready?

34:00.864 --> 34:02.214
No, not really.

34:02.301 --> 34:04.477
You go to war
with the army you have.

34:04.564 --> 34:06.087
Read what's there,
and hang up.

34:06.174 --> 34:07.610
Okay.

34:07.697 --> 34:10.135
[Irish accent]
"Listen. Do not interrupt.

34:10.222 --> 34:13.747
"I know who killed Carlos Ruiz,
and I've a video to prove it.

34:13.834 --> 34:16.576
"for $10,000, I'll give you
this video on a cd.

34:16.663 --> 34:19.361
"There's a parking lot at
the south end of Fourth Street.

34:19.448 --> 34:21.624
- I'll be waiting for you in.."
- Forty five minutes.

34:21.711 --> 34:24.323
Forty five minutes.
Don't be late.

34:24.410 --> 34:26.716
- Bravo.
- The jury reached a verdict.

34:26.803 --> 34:28.979
- When are they reading it?
- Six o'clock.

34:29.067 --> 34:31.156
- Almost an hour. Shall we?
- Yeah.

34:44.691 --> 34:46.475
It's been 45 minutes.

34:46.562 --> 34:48.738
44.

34:48.825 --> 34:50.000
Patience.

34:56.877 --> 34:58.052
[tires screeching]

35:00.620 --> 35:01.795
Hello.

35:10.978 --> 35:13.111
[Lisbon]
'Okay, Murphy's here.'

35:22.555 --> 35:24.513
Where are you?

35:26.167 --> 35:27.299
[tires screeching]

35:46.405 --> 35:47.362
[car door closes]

35:47.449 --> 35:49.016
Hello.

35:49.103 --> 35:50.452
Where's the money?

35:50.539 --> 35:52.411
Ten thousand dollars.
It's all there.

35:57.720 --> 35:59.113
Now the cd?

36:07.774 --> 36:09.210
Where else
is the video stored?

36:09.297 --> 36:11.473
Take it easy now.

36:11.560 --> 36:13.954
Where else
is the video stored?

36:14.041 --> 36:15.564
W-what video?

36:15.651 --> 36:18.828
The video on the cd.
The video of the murder!

36:18.915 --> 36:20.352
Where else is it stored?

36:20.439 --> 36:23.485
What video? What murder?
You off your nut?

36:23.572 --> 36:24.965
Amy. Put the gun down.

36:25.052 --> 36:26.706
No, no. No, no.

36:26.793 --> 36:27.794
Drop it!

36:27.881 --> 36:29.970
- Now!
- You called me!

36:30.057 --> 36:31.798
I-I know there's a video.

36:31.885 --> 36:35.454
The cops told Eve there's a
murder video. I spoke to her.

36:35.541 --> 36:39.458
I didn't call ya. There's no
video on there, you silly cow.

36:41.895 --> 36:43.940
Okay, come on.
Let's make this snappy.

36:44.027 --> 36:45.812
We got eight minutes to 6:00.

36:45.899 --> 36:48.118
- You set all this up?
- Who set what up?

36:48.206 --> 36:50.947
- What the hell's going on?
- Amy killed Carlos.

36:51.034 --> 36:53.733
She thought your cd had
a video of the murder.

36:53.820 --> 36:55.300
Bring Murphy
into the station

36:55.387 --> 36:57.215
and book him for receiving
stolen information.

36:57.302 --> 36:59.086
I'm taking Amy to court.

36:59.173 --> 37:00.218
Seven minutes.

37:04.178 --> 37:07.268
In the matter ofCalifornia
against Eve Mulberry

37:07.355 --> 37:10.228
all rise for the honorable
Judge Isley Markman.

37:14.493 --> 37:17.757
The jury's reached a verdict.
Bailiff, please bring them in.

37:17.844 --> 37:19.628
- Hold on!
- 'What is going on there?'

37:19.715 --> 37:21.108
Bailiff, remove those people.

37:21.195 --> 37:23.937
Wait. We're with the CBI.

37:24.024 --> 37:26.461
I know who you are.

37:26.548 --> 37:28.028
He pulled
that mind reading trick

37:28.115 --> 37:29.464
in my courtroom last month.

37:29.551 --> 37:31.031
[Lisbon]
'I'm sorry to barge in'

37:31.118 --> 37:33.816
but this is the woman
who killed Carlos Ruiz.

37:33.903 --> 37:35.644
[Ardiles]
'They're showing contempt
for these proceedings.'

37:35.731 --> 37:38.125
- This is an embarrassment.
- It's an embarrassment to you.

37:38.212 --> 37:41.998
You had no idea
Amy framed Eve for murder.

37:42.085 --> 37:44.305
Amy?

37:44.392 --> 37:46.873
If you did this,
you have to say something now.

37:48.788 --> 37:50.224
I want a lawyer first.

37:50.311 --> 37:51.660
Enough.

37:51.747 --> 37:54.402
Everyone in
my chambers now, except you.

38:02.367 --> 38:05.021
My client is willing
to confess

38:05.108 --> 38:06.806
but under one condition..

38:06.893 --> 38:10.288
...the D.A.'s office takes
the death penalty off the table.

38:10.375 --> 38:12.681
Well?

38:12.768 --> 38:15.249
How did Jane know
that it was a frame job?

38:15.336 --> 38:17.686
The neighbor saw a woman
with long blonde hair

38:17.773 --> 38:19.949
leaving the victim's house
the night of the murder.

38:20.036 --> 38:21.516
Jane knew that
Eve was innocent.

38:21.603 --> 38:24.040
It had to have been
a woman in a wig.

38:24.127 --> 38:26.173
Eve's sister, she couldn't
have pulled this off.

38:26.260 --> 38:28.828
[Lisbon]
'She couldn't even
pour a glass of wine.'

38:28.915 --> 38:32.092
'Amy was the only one
who was capable and had motive.'

38:34.094 --> 38:36.226
Unbelievable.

38:36.314 --> 38:38.316
Yeah. Death is off the table.

38:39.752 --> 38:41.275
Start talking, young lady.

38:44.365 --> 38:47.107
I just wanted
what was mine, you know?

38:49.501 --> 38:53.896
Our wine is a sensation.
Everybody loves it.

38:53.983 --> 38:55.594
Investors wanted
to jump on board

38:55.681 --> 38:57.683
and they wanted
to make us rich.

38:59.554 --> 39:02.427
And Eve wants to stay small.

39:02.514 --> 39:05.212
Small? She has acres of land.
She has a rich husband.

39:05.299 --> 39:07.083
What does she know about that?

39:07.170 --> 39:09.129
I work nearly
a hundred hours a week.

39:09.216 --> 39:12.262
I can barely make my mortgage.

39:12.350 --> 39:15.135
[Amy]
'I thought this was my shot.'

39:15.222 --> 39:18.225
And Eve had told you
about her affair with Carlos.

39:18.312 --> 39:21.489
You knew, if he was killed,
she'd be investigated.

39:21.576 --> 39:23.622
Yes.

39:23.709 --> 39:26.842
I told Carlos
I was a friend of Eve's.

39:26.929 --> 39:29.628
[Amy narrating]
I didn't know if someone
would see me so..

39:29.715 --> 39:33.240
...I wore the wig
to make them think I was Eve.

39:33.327 --> 39:36.939
I said I was interested
in taking dance lessons.

39:37.026 --> 39:38.506
He invited me in.

39:47.689 --> 39:51.214
And the murder weapon,
I took from our vineyard

39:51.301 --> 39:53.347
I knew her fingerprints
would be on it.

39:56.655 --> 39:57.786
[glass shattering]

40:20.853 --> 40:22.376
What are you doing here?

40:24.204 --> 40:26.162
I want my job back.

40:26.249 --> 40:28.251
[dings]
Go home.

40:28.338 --> 40:30.079
You know,
I was handling that situation

40:30.166 --> 40:33.039
just fine today
until you busted in.

40:33.126 --> 40:36.346
I need this job, Kimball.
I've given up everything else.

40:36.434 --> 40:37.609
[elevator whirring]

40:37.696 --> 40:40.568
Why would you
take this from me?

40:40.655 --> 40:42.352
[paper rustles]

40:42.440 --> 40:45.181
- Because you're crazy!
- What are you gonna do, huh?

40:45.268 --> 40:47.445
- Hit me?
- No. That's what you want.

40:47.532 --> 40:49.316
What?

40:49.403 --> 40:51.144
That's why you kept
pushing Murphy today.

40:51.231 --> 40:54.887
- What are you talking about?
- You get off on danger.

40:54.974 --> 40:58.281
It provides a distraction
from your unhappy life!

40:58.368 --> 41:00.632
Screw you, Kimball!

41:00.719 --> 41:02.851
Y-you're not so difficult
to figure out yourself!

41:02.938 --> 41:05.941
Yeah? What'd you
figure out?

41:06.028 --> 41:09.249
Nothing! And it's
driving me crazy!

41:09.336 --> 41:10.772
- Who are you?
- I gotta go.

41:10.859 --> 41:12.774
No! No. No. No.

41:12.861 --> 41:15.429
- Only if you give me my job.
- Move.

41:15.516 --> 41:17.475
You fired me
because you like me.

41:17.562 --> 41:20.173
You like me,
and don't know what to do.

41:20.260 --> 41:21.827
- Admit it!
- Okay, I like you.

41:21.914 --> 41:24.351
Admit it!

41:24.438 --> 41:26.484
Oh.

41:26.571 --> 41:28.529
I'm so sorry. Y-you do?

41:31.010 --> 41:33.491
Can I go now?

41:33.578 --> 41:37.277
[sighs]

41:37.364 --> 41:38.496
Mmm.

41:49.550 --> 41:52.466
[male #5]
'Were you astonished
by the verdict?'

41:52.553 --> 41:54.990
[female #2]
'Eve, this way.'

41:55.077 --> 41:57.471
[indistinct shouting]

42:02.432 --> 42:04.783
[male #6]
'How about
a kiss for the cameras?'

42:07.220 --> 42:08.917
[clapping]

42:09.004 --> 42:10.179
Jane.

42:11.354 --> 42:12.530
Your nickel.

42:14.488 --> 42:17.012
Bet you're glad
you didn't bet a million.

42:17.099 --> 42:18.231
Goodnight, Jane.

42:22.278 --> 42:24.629
[shouting continues]

42:37.511 --> 42:39.905
[theme music]
