WEBVTT

00:01.110 --> 00:03.078
(Applause)

00:03.407 --> 00:06.119
Thank you and welcome

00:06.239 --> 00:09.851
to the Magic Cavern's
50th anniversary gathering.

00:10.351 --> 00:12.887
I was deeply humbled when
the owner, Steve Parrish,

00:13.007 --> 00:14.844
asked me to headline tonight.

00:14.964 --> 00:17.531
Now, I could tell you the
importance of the Cavern.

00:17.651 --> 00:20.227
How it holds a special place in my heart.

00:20.679 --> 00:23.842
But instead, I'll show you.

00:28.044 --> 00:31.071
Now my fans know that I'm not a magician.

00:31.522 --> 00:34.140
What I do is blend dreams with reality.

00:34.573 --> 00:38.311
But sometimes those
dreams become nightmares.

00:38.601 --> 00:41.979
I'm gonna take you down
into a nightmare world

00:42.099 --> 00:44.751
envisioned by a great Italian poet.

00:45.029 --> 00:48.662
This is Dante's Inferno.

00:48.782 --> 00:50.456
(Laughter)

00:50.576 --> 00:53.320
Dante envisioned hell to be made up of

00:53.440 --> 00:57.463
nine circles of sin: waywardness, lust,

00:57.583 --> 01:00.512
gluttony, avarice, greed, heresy,

01:00.632 --> 01:04.637
fraud, violence, and finally, treachery.

01:05.242 --> 01:08.841
This platform represents
that final circle of hell.

01:09.455 --> 01:12.217
What I do is real and tonight you will see

01:12.337 --> 01:15.981
how real
- as neither me or Ashley will be tested.

01:16.261 --> 01:18.083
Tonight, it will be one of you.

01:18.203 --> 01:22.588
Who amongst you is willing to
take up this ultimate challenge.

01:22.656 --> 01:23.941
I'll do it.

01:24.536 --> 01:27.926
- Yes, sir. Your name?
- Felix Barclay.

01:27.993 --> 01:32.630
- Are you pure of heart?
- Uh, you'd have to ask my wife.

01:37.307 --> 01:40.146
I'm sure many of you
recognize Felix Barclay.

01:40.266 --> 01:44.242
Financial guru, philanthropist,
and known around the Cavern

01:44.310 --> 01:46.778
as a skilled amateur magician.

01:49.248 --> 01:51.897
Now, this is very dangerous.
Are you certain you wish

01:52.017 --> 01:55.252
to take this ultimate test of your faith?

01:55.938 --> 01:56.884
I am.

01:57.004 --> 02:01.371
Very well. We'll see you on the other side.

02:07.733 --> 02:10.471
(Laughter)

02:12.000 --> 02:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:19.711 --> 02:22.345
Spirits! Bring me what I need.

02:23.622 --> 02:26.883
This is the world's most powerful crossbow

02:26.918 --> 02:30.908
and I can assure you
it's authentic and deadly.

02:32.117 --> 02:34.260
(Gasps)

02:34.380 --> 02:37.293
Ladies and gentlemen, I
will be firing this bow

02:37.328 --> 02:39.596
directly at Felix Barclay's heart.

02:39.631 --> 02:44.166
As you can see, my assistant Ashley
has manacled Felix to a stake.

02:44.200 --> 02:47.202
Just as he turns his
fate over to the spirits,

02:47.237 --> 02:51.140
I, too, give myself over to their power.

02:51.207 --> 02:56.012
Spirits! If you find Felix pure of heart

02:56.046 --> 02:59.949
then release him from his manacles.

02:59.757 --> 03:03.166
But if you find him impure, guide my hand.

03:03.286 --> 03:06.436
Show me where to aim
and I'll fire this bolt

03:06.556 --> 03:09.191
through his heart.

03:09.225 --> 03:10.455
It is time.

03:14.297 --> 03:16.812
Five, four,

03:16.932 --> 03:20.202
three, two,

03:20.270 --> 03:21.586
one!

03:23.273 --> 03:25.555
And now for the moment of truth.

03:25.675 --> 03:28.894
Did the spirits allow Felix safe passage?

03:29.014 --> 03:31.280
Or did they damn him to the ninth circle

03:31.347 --> 03:33.682
- for all eternity?
- Ooh.

03:33.749 --> 03:36.351
Let's ask the man in the front row.

03:40.455 --> 03:42.248
Turn the lights up.

03:45.661 --> 03:48.632
Someone call 911! NOW!

03:51.660 --> 03:54.262
Adam! You up? I'm late.

03:54.382 --> 03:56.853
Mmhm. Yep.

03:58.506 --> 04:00.334
Sorry, it was a late night at the club.

04:00.454 --> 04:01.032
(Beeping)

04:03.506 --> 04:06.813
- How you doing?
- Sorry, it's Becker. Gotta go.

04:06.933 --> 04:09.641
- Hey.
- Goodmorning!

04:12.743 --> 04:15.723
- OK.
- Ah ah ah!

04:15.843 --> 04:17.885
Aren't you forgetting something, hmm?

04:17.920 --> 04:19.774
- Thank you.
- Aren't you forgetting

04:19.894 --> 04:21.538
something else, hmm?

04:23.959 --> 04:25.993
Bye.

04:29.898 --> 04:31.832
OK, I'm here. What's going on?

04:31.866 --> 04:34.427
Yeah I'll let Dev tell you.
(Whisper): He's a bit excited.

04:34.547 --> 04:35.917
OK. OK OK OK.

04:36.037 --> 04:38.946
So this is going to be the
coolest case we've ever covered.

04:39.066 --> 04:40.840
Why, you ask? Because this brings us

04:40.874 --> 04:44.311
into the world of magic! Magic!

04:44.378 --> 04:47.113
It worked when I was... in the washroom.

04:47.148 --> 04:49.546
Alright, uh. I get you, buddy.

04:50.039 --> 04:52.738
Last night there was an
incident at the magic Cavern.

04:52.858 --> 04:54.821
A magician pulled a
volunteer from the audience

04:54.855 --> 04:58.066
to use in a magic trick
using a crossbow. But, uh...

04:58.186 --> 05:01.954
- the volunteer was killed.
- OK well we don't investigate

05:02.074 --> 05:05.381
accidents, so is there a
reason it got kicked up to IIB?

05:05.501 --> 05:07.380
I can give you 250 million of them.

05:07.898 --> 05:09.801
That's the estimated value
of the victim's estate.

05:09.921 --> 05:12.497
- Corporal?
- Oh, right.

05:12.617 --> 05:16.602
This is Felix Barclay,
a top investment advisor.

05:16.722 --> 05:18.177
This guy's made a lot of
money for a lot of people.

05:18.211 --> 05:20.602
But, he also gave back to
the community. He chaired

05:20.722 --> 05:23.084
on a number of foundations
and sat on a lot of boards.

05:23.204 --> 05:24.897
Including the Magic Cavern board.

05:25.017 --> 05:26.985
Apparently he was very hands on. They say

05:27.019 --> 05:29.347
- that he lived for magic.
- Sounds like he died

05:29.467 --> 05:32.023
for it, too. What do we
know about the magician?

05:32.057 --> 05:34.092
That would be Dante Blake.

05:34.126 --> 05:36.682
This guy is like a remix Chris Angel.

05:36.802 --> 05:38.378
Drug problems? Criminal record?

05:38.498 --> 05:39.905
He's clean. The only thing criminal

05:40.025 --> 05:42.386
from what I hear about
Dante is the size of his ego.

05:42.506 --> 05:44.769
Actually, Dante told
Metro that he had performed

05:44.889 --> 05:47.071
the illusion correctly and
that pulling Felix Barclay

05:47.191 --> 05:50.054
on stage had been carefully
planned and rehearsed earlier.

05:50.174 --> 05:52.842
- So what went wrong?
- Equipment failure.

05:52.877 --> 05:55.090
If I fired a crossbow
into some rich guy's chest,

05:55.210 --> 05:56.872
I'd blame equipment failure, too.

05:56.992 --> 05:59.353
Well, Metro forensics
didn't find any obvious signs

05:59.473 --> 06:01.438
of tampering, so they reached out

06:01.558 --> 06:05.794
to the man who designed
and built it, Tomas Vaughn.

06:05.914 --> 06:08.146
This guy is at the top of
his game, he has created some

06:08.266 --> 06:10.442
of the most spectacular illusions today,

06:10.562 --> 06:13.029
and he just landed on
the red-eye from Vegas.

06:13.326 --> 06:15.847
Well, Barclay was a wealthy man.

06:15.967 --> 06:17.767
He must have had enemies, right?

06:17.835 --> 06:20.019
Maybe some of those
enemies had deep pockets,

06:20.139 --> 06:22.422
made it worth Dante Blake's
while to take him out.

06:22.858 --> 06:26.544
Logan, this'll be a perfect
test in your face reading skills.

06:26.664 --> 06:29.768
Why don't you bring Dante
Blake in? See what he's hiding.

06:31.749 --> 06:33.551
I think he was being nice to me.

06:33.671 --> 06:37.921
Maybe he's starting to
finally appreciate your value.

06:41.357 --> 06:44.819
Felix was a good friend and
a skilled amateur magician.

06:44.939 --> 06:46.419
He organized the gala and it was his idea

06:46.539 --> 06:47.476
to take part in the illusion.

06:47.596 --> 06:53.468
He was one of our most
distinguished members.

06:53.588 --> 06:56.318
So the Magic Cavern is a private club

06:56.438 --> 06:58.637
- as well as a theatre?
- Yeah my father founded

06:58.757 --> 07:02.216
the Cavern in '64.
Magicians are a special breed

07:02.336 --> 07:03.668
they need a place to call their own.

07:03.788 --> 07:06.915
As an amateur magician,
Felix felt at home here

07:06.950 --> 07:09.664
- and he was deeply invested.
- Do you mean financially?

07:10.560 --> 07:13.220
Well, I'm the majority owner
but he held a stake, yeah.

07:13.340 --> 07:16.457
More than investing money,
he invested heart and soul.

07:16.577 --> 07:18.459
<i>The Cavern will die without him.</i>

07:18.493 --> 07:21.261
Are you worried about the
future now that Felix is gone?

07:21.329 --> 07:23.488
No, our financial state is good,

07:23.608 --> 07:26.990
he made sure of that. But
his voice will be missed

07:27.110 --> 07:27.912
on our board.

07:28.222 --> 07:29.403
Does he have any enemies?

07:29.471 --> 07:31.627
Someone from the financial world?

07:31.747 --> 07:34.283
Felix made his clients a lot of money.

07:34.403 --> 07:38.145
I mean, his clients
loved him. So did we all.

07:38.179 --> 07:40.414
Thank you for your time. If
we have any more questions...

07:40.534 --> 07:41.996
Yeah I..., you can find me in my office.

07:42.116 --> 07:44.315
Great, OK.

07:44.435 --> 07:46.738
While Tomas Vaughn, the designer, is here

07:46.858 --> 07:47.929
we're gonna want to speak to him.

07:48.049 --> 07:50.356
See if he knows what went
wrong with Dante's Inferno.

07:50.476 --> 07:53.060
Good. I can handle Dante myself.

07:53.095 --> 07:54.799
- You sure?
- Yeah, you heard Becker.

07:54.919 --> 07:57.063
He wants to see what I can come up with.

07:57.098 --> 07:59.299
- OK.
- Good luck.

08:01.099 --> 08:03.444
What happened last night
was a terrible tragedy,

08:03.564 --> 08:05.639
but I had nothing to do
with that man's death.

08:05.759 --> 08:08.244
You fired the crossbow that killed him.

08:08.364 --> 08:10.312
Yeah but he was supposed to
be free from his restraints

08:10.432 --> 08:12.045
and down a trap door at that point, OK?

08:12.079 --> 08:14.064
Equipment failed across the board.

08:14.184 --> 08:16.358
And when you checked the
equipment before the show

08:16.478 --> 08:20.766
- nothing seemed wrong?
- Yeah well, I just give

08:20.886 --> 08:23.152
the stuff a quick once over.
It's my assistant Ashley,

08:23.272 --> 08:24.971
she tests it. That's her responsibility.

08:25.091 --> 08:27.465
<i>She should have been
all over it. Not my job.</i>

08:27.585 --> 08:29.759
Do you understand? My agent was this close

08:29.879 --> 08:32.171
to finalizing a deal for
me in Las Vegas, alright?

08:32.291 --> 08:34.216
This close. And then last night happens

08:34.336 --> 08:36.616
and then all of it just goes away. Poof.

08:36.736 --> 08:39.061
Yeah, last night a man died
and you seem more worried

08:39.181 --> 08:41.626
- about your career.
- Yeah, well, let's just say

08:41.746 --> 08:44.280
there were two victims last
night. Because I'm done.

08:44.401 --> 08:46.342
- It's over.
- Can you think of anyone

08:46.462 --> 08:48.495
who'd want to see you fail?

08:48.615 --> 08:51.488
Yeah. Plenty of people.
Practically every magician

08:51.608 --> 08:52.847
I know. They're all haters.

08:52.967 --> 08:55.989
<i>Mellini must be laughing.</i>

08:56.109 --> 08:58.024
According to my intel, you've got a problem

08:58.144 --> 09:02.128
- with a guy named, um, Mellini.
- Mellini?

09:02.248 --> 09:06.766
You broke the oath. You
stole from me, Dante.

09:06.886 --> 09:11.104
Yeah. Something go down
between the two of you?

09:12.204 --> 09:13.485
No, not at all.

09:13.605 --> 09:16.208
In fact Mellini's not really even worth
talking about. Look if you don't mind,

09:16.328 --> 09:20.345
I've been up all night and
I could use some sleep, so...

09:20.465 --> 09:22.681
Hundreds of illusions, I've created.

09:22.716 --> 09:26.410
And never, not once, has
one of my creations failed.

09:27.057 --> 09:28.901
Until last night.

09:28.973 --> 09:31.164
No, No. My illusion did not fail.

09:31.184 --> 09:34.714
It is virtually foolproof.
Here, I will show.

09:35.340 --> 09:36.995
Come here, you.

09:40.133 --> 09:43.267
You will see these manacles.

09:43.387 --> 09:46.037
They are very real.

09:46.157 --> 09:49.440
And... oh! They do lock.

09:49.560 --> 09:55.003
And... how do I, uh, how do I unlock them?

09:56.234 --> 09:58.815
You don't. Like everything else

09:59.036 --> 10:02.020
in this world, this
illusion is computerized.

10:02.140 --> 10:06.123
I'm assistant and I have a tiny remote.

10:06.243 --> 10:08.060
When I pull around curtain

10:08.094 --> 10:10.762
and the illusionist gives me all clear,

10:10.882 --> 10:16.691
time to simply press this
button and... platform spins,

10:16.811 --> 10:20.838
manacles open. All of it automatic.

10:20.958 --> 10:23.459
Call it automagic.

10:23.579 --> 10:25.489
No. I would not call it that.

10:25.609 --> 10:29.699
And then the prisoner is
freed, he, quick like bunny,

10:29.819 --> 10:34.500
goes down trap door into little room below.

10:34.620 --> 10:37.797
Down below stage is
where real magic happens.

10:37.917 --> 10:40.257
This is where we house gears and mechanisms

10:40.377 --> 10:43.907
- that run illusions above.
- It is hot as hell down here.

10:44.027 --> 10:47.082
As it should be, it is
near 9th circle of hell.

10:47.202 --> 10:50.233
That is joke. It is near furnace.

10:50.353 --> 10:52.821
- Has Metro been down here?
- Yeah they took a look,

10:52.941 --> 10:54.570
but they didn't see
anything out of the ordinary.

10:54.605 --> 10:58.041
Here, this is what I want to show.

10:58.075 --> 11:02.040
This is the motor that powers the illusion.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.347
When you push the button,

11:04.382 --> 11:07.509
the motor spins the platform, yes?

11:07.550 --> 11:10.960
But all it takes is
something like this nail

11:11.070 --> 11:16.066
to jam the gears, which
stops platform from spinning.

11:16.625 --> 11:18.393
Which means manacles won't open

11:18.445 --> 11:21.914
and poor Felix takes
bolt in chest. Like this.

11:21.949 --> 11:23.983
Nothing seems to have been jammed in there.

11:24.017 --> 11:27.253
No metal dust, no
stripped gears, no scoring.

11:28.456 --> 11:32.227
But we know for certain
this apparatus was sabotaged.

11:32.342 --> 11:36.813
But how? Hm. Yes, this is very puzzling.

11:36.847 --> 11:37.715
It's almost as if it was done by...

11:38.068 --> 11:40.736
Don't say it.

11:41.772 --> 11:44.240
Now that I've captured
the apparatus in high res,

11:44.274 --> 11:46.142
Alex will render it as
a three dimensional model

11:46.176 --> 11:48.144
using photogrammetry so we
can run multiple simulations.

11:48.278 --> 11:51.247
I don't understand half of what you just
said but that sounds like a good plan.

11:51.281 --> 11:54.884
- Yeah, neither did I. - What about you?
What did you get from the magician?

11:54.918 --> 11:57.586
- I don't think he did it.
- Why is that?

11:57.621 --> 11:59.622
Killing Barclay is the worst
thing that could have happened

11:59.656 --> 12:02.992
to Dante, he just lost a big
contract in Vegas because of it.

12:03.027 --> 12:05.728
Besides, I don't think he'd
know how to sabotage the illusion

12:05.762 --> 12:07.830
if he wanted to. It's
his assistant, Ashley,

12:07.898 --> 12:10.098
- who tests all the gear.
- Good thing we're talking

12:10.133 --> 12:12.167
to her next. I had a unit bring her in.

12:14.300 --> 12:15.637
Oh Dev, um...

12:15.712 --> 12:17.913
You know about a magician named Mellini?

12:18.281 --> 12:21.750
Yeah, he used to perform
at the Cavern all the time.

12:21.818 --> 12:23.219
But he's really fallen off. Why?

12:23.253 --> 12:25.288
Well, I think there's bad
blood between him and Dante.

12:25.291 --> 12:27.659
I got a read where Mellini
was calling him a thief.

12:28.127 --> 12:30.261
Might be worth looking into.

12:30.329 --> 12:33.197
Look, I run a thorough safety check

12:33.232 --> 12:35.800
30 minutes before show time.

12:35.867 --> 12:39.238
It checked out perfectly.

12:39.315 --> 12:41.950
And then I went to makeup.
I suppose somebody could have

12:42.217 --> 12:44.419
got to it after my check while
I was in my dressing room.

12:44.487 --> 12:46.889
Ashley can you think of anyone
who'd want to kill Mr. Barclay?

12:46.957 --> 12:50.667
- No. No, he's a lovely man.
- You knew him well?

12:50.692 --> 12:52.828
No, not really.

12:52.862 --> 12:56.898
<i>I still have the diamonds he gave me.</i>

12:56.966 --> 13:00.201
Alright. Ashley, you shouldn't lie to us.

13:00.683 --> 13:03.252
We know that you and Felix
were having a relationship.

13:03.720 --> 13:07.556
He, he took me out on a few dates.

13:07.558 --> 13:09.725
And this is before he was married.

13:09.760 --> 13:11.960
He had a thing for the assistants.

13:11.994 --> 13:15.364
Particularly my best friend,
Samantha, who became his wife.

13:15.398 --> 13:17.966
Samantha Barclay works with you?

13:18.034 --> 13:20.469
Um, not any more. She quit
to focus on charity work.

13:20.537 --> 13:23.973
- She's an amazing woman.
- You guys stayed close

13:23.977 --> 13:27.446
- even after she married Felix?
- Yes, why not?

13:27.580 --> 13:30.582
Best friend, marries an ex-boyfriend.

13:30.650 --> 13:33.852
- Things could get complicated.
- Well it didn't.

13:33.920 --> 13:35.856
<i>Can't know we're having an affair.</i>

13:35.872 --> 13:40.480
OK. I think that's all for now.

13:40.541 --> 13:44.510
- You're free to go.
- OK.

13:48.948 --> 13:50.915
So it turns out that we were just speaking

13:50.950 --> 13:52.917
to Felix's mistress.

13:52.952 --> 13:54.319
I thought he was a real boy scout.

13:54.372 --> 13:56.707
- Yeah, me too.
- When a cheating spouse

13:56.942 --> 14:00.777
is killed, 9 times out of 10
there is one person responsible.

14:05.416 --> 14:08.552
Still such a terrible shock.

14:08.586 --> 14:10.554
Mrs. Barclay, we have reason to believe

14:10.588 --> 14:12.624
that your husband was murdered.

14:12.729 --> 14:17.471
Th... that's impossible.
Who would want to kill Felix?

14:17.548 --> 14:20.384
Did he have any rivals or
enemies that you can think of?

14:20.718 --> 14:23.954
No, he didn't make any enemies. He
was just busy making people rich.

14:23.988 --> 14:26.155
And your marriage, everything was OK?

14:26.223 --> 14:28.024
Of course.

14:28.058 --> 14:31.862
Did your husband know Dante's
assistant, Ashley Green?

14:31.896 --> 14:34.197
Why do you ask?

14:34.231 --> 14:35.799
Well we have reason to believe

14:35.882 --> 14:39.718
- that they were involved.
- Ha! Sorry.

14:39.753 --> 14:42.255
Sorry, that's ridiculous.

14:42.322 --> 14:46.025
<i>More like he didn't know.
He never suspected a thing.</i>

14:46.059 --> 14:47.627
It sounds like there's something

14:47.661 --> 14:49.829
you're not telling us about.

14:56.936 --> 14:59.204
Ha! Ha! Ha!

14:59.272 --> 15:02.174
(Groaning)

15:05.112 --> 15:08.080
This has been a tough 24
hours. I'd like to go now.

15:08.648 --> 15:12.350
Yeah. We understand. You're free to go.

15:17.778 --> 15:20.846
We had it wrong. Ashley
was having an affair

15:20.868 --> 15:23.036
but it wasn't with Felix.

15:23.083 --> 15:25.918
It was with Samantha.

15:28.770 --> 15:32.625
Victim's wife and magician's
assistant. What's the connection?

15:32.741 --> 15:35.442
Samantha and Ashley are sleeping together.

15:35.511 --> 15:37.443
- Oh.
- If Felix knew

15:37.498 --> 15:40.306
about the affair, maybe
he threatened divorce.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.701
That would give Samantha
enough reason to get rid of him.

15:42.818 --> 15:44.720
Well that's motive, what about means?

15:44.817 --> 15:46.851
Samantha was a magician's assistant

15:46.862 --> 15:49.889
before she married Felix,
so she has the skillset.

15:49.897 --> 15:51.868
Maybe she got Ashley's help.

15:51.899 --> 15:53.468
It's a good theory. Run with it.

15:53.535 --> 15:56.103
I already have, Ashley's on her way up.

15:56.171 --> 15:58.940
OK. Oh, uh, one last thing.

15:59.007 --> 16:02.109
Who copped to the affair?
Was that Samantha or Ashley?

16:02.177 --> 16:04.311
Neither. Neither of them... confessed.

16:04.379 --> 16:07.014
So how'd you guys figure that out?

16:07.082 --> 16:09.536
Well through a series of
deductions, face reading,

16:09.552 --> 16:11.119
uh, body language.

16:12.082 --> 16:15.184
Look, I... I'm still struggling
to understand your technique

16:15.237 --> 16:16.573
here so I'm wondering if
you'd just walk me through it.

16:16.886 --> 16:19.787
OK. When I asked Samantha
about Ashley she started playing

16:19.829 --> 16:22.542
with her wedding ring, which
I noticed was a bit loose,

16:22.618 --> 16:25.286
so she probably takes it off frequently.

16:25.378 --> 16:29.014
That leads me to believe she's
probably having an affair.

16:29.049 --> 16:33.486
- OK. Go on.
- I ask Ashley about Samantha

16:33.490 --> 16:35.324
and she touches her suprasternal notch.

16:35.892 --> 16:38.894
It's this little notch here, that
little dip between your clavicles.

16:38.895 --> 16:40.730
- OK.
- It's a spot people touch

16:40.743 --> 16:42.945
when they're thinking about their lovers.

16:42.979 --> 16:47.915
<i>So, put those two reads together. Voila!</i>

16:50.672 --> 16:53.041
Thanks that was uh, that was very helpful.

16:53.575 --> 16:55.543
- Thanks.
- Awesome.

16:55.611 --> 16:58.712
- Suprasternal notch?
- Yeah I pulled that one out.

16:58.746 --> 17:00.014
Well I think Becker's genuinely trying

17:00.032 --> 17:02.000
to understand your technique.

17:02.334 --> 17:04.869
I just don't like being
put under a microscope.

17:04.897 --> 17:07.531
Yeah. Let's go talk to Ashley.

17:09.051 --> 17:11.462
Suprasternal notch?

17:11.755 --> 17:14.257
Samantha told us about the affair.

17:14.692 --> 17:16.659
She told us everything.

17:16.694 --> 17:20.396
Where you two would meet. Even what
she got you for Valentine's day.

17:21.432 --> 17:22.800
Oh my God!

17:23.324 --> 17:27.373
Oh baby, I love it. Thank you so much.

17:29.330 --> 17:32.265
It's a nice ring.

17:35.173 --> 17:37.240
Why didn't you tell us?

17:40.044 --> 17:42.012
I, I didn't think it was relevant.

17:42.646 --> 17:44.780
Tell us about the affair.

17:45.396 --> 17:49.333
Well, um. I knew how I felt about Samantha

17:49.338 --> 17:52.308
from the moment we met.
But I just dated men

17:52.387 --> 17:55.889
up to that point so I was confused

17:56.223 --> 17:59.192
and kept my feelings hidden.
We became best friends,

17:59.226 --> 18:01.194
I was even her maid of honour.

18:01.228 --> 18:03.863
But it just got to the point
where I couldn't stand lying

18:03.889 --> 18:07.291
to myself, you know? And
I had one too many drinks

18:07.366 --> 18:10.303
one night and I told her how I felt

18:10.363 --> 18:14.200
and amazingly, she felt the same way.

18:16.027 --> 18:19.229
It was a liberating moment for her, too.

18:19.297 --> 18:21.266
If it was so liberating
for her why didn't she tell

18:21.270 --> 18:22.505
her husband the truth?

18:22.559 --> 18:24.894
She was planning to. You know,
she's working her way up to it.

18:25.228 --> 18:27.670
Right. But instead she
just decided to kill him.

18:28.849 --> 18:31.316
Why on earth would she do that?

18:31.384 --> 18:33.019
Well if he found out about the affair

18:33.023 --> 18:35.157
he would want a divorce, right?

18:35.397 --> 18:36.397
And their pre-nup states

18:36.431 --> 18:38.432
that an affair nullifies all claims.

18:38.500 --> 18:41.602
So that's why she killed him. And
she probably got your help to do it.

18:41.670 --> 18:43.971
OK, that's ludicrous.

18:44.039 --> 18:47.408
Look, I liked Felix. I
would never want to hurt him.

18:47.475 --> 18:49.811
Oh but sleeping with
his wife is totally fine?

18:51.980 --> 18:53.315
I think Ashley's telling the truth,

18:53.383 --> 18:54.617
she didn't kill Felix Barclay.

18:54.684 --> 18:56.119
OK well Samantha's still on the table

18:56.182 --> 18:58.117
she had means, motive and opportunity.

18:58.351 --> 19:01.376
Hey, got Miles Mellini in interrogation.

19:01.377 --> 19:03.345
Wish I could be there to
observe but I've got this thing

19:03.412 --> 19:05.080
with the superintendent. Have fun.

19:05.129 --> 19:06.730
- We'll keep you posted.
- Yep. See you in the morning.

19:06.816 --> 19:09.417
Thanks.

19:12.010 --> 19:14.244
Please excuse my ignorance Mr. Mellini,

19:14.299 --> 19:17.435
but what is it that you do exactly?

19:17.703 --> 19:19.637
Are you a magician or a mentalist?

19:19.671 --> 19:22.473
Mentalists are magicians.

19:26.087 --> 19:29.356
Let me show you what I mean.

19:29.824 --> 19:32.091
<i>Tired eyes. Drumming fingers.</i>

19:32.126 --> 19:35.662
<i>Impatient. Smudge where she wipes spittle.</i>

19:35.730 --> 19:37.798
You have a new baby at home.

19:40.401 --> 19:42.803
Is that so?

19:42.870 --> 19:45.004
<i>Sergeant's badge. Trapezius are up.</i>

19:45.072 --> 19:47.006
<i>She's angry. Bitter. Zygomaticus major.</i>

19:47.074 --> 19:49.709
<i>She's disappointed but trying to hide it.</i>

19:49.777 --> 19:53.513
I'm sorry about your disappointing news.

19:53.548 --> 19:57.484
I'm sure you deserved that promotion.

19:58.701 --> 20:00.303
OK, we're not here

20:00.321 --> 20:03.723
to have a show of your powers, Mr. Mellini.

20:04.191 --> 20:06.558
What is your history with Dante Blake?

20:06.583 --> 20:07.818
Brief.

20:07.893 --> 20:09.861
Rumour is he stole your
secrets and sold them

20:09.895 --> 20:13.207
- to another mentalist.
- And he made enough cash

20:13.327 --> 20:16.278
from his larceny to buy
new illusions from Vaughn

20:16.398 --> 20:20.143
- and strike out on his own.
- Do you hate him?

20:20.177 --> 20:22.236
Well I never sent him Christmas cards.

20:22.968 --> 20:24.675
<i>He's trying to read me.</i>

20:24.795 --> 20:27.399
<i>Give him nothing to work with.</i>

20:27.519 --> 20:29.824
Let me ask you something.

20:29.944 --> 20:32.921
<i>What is the 9th circle of
hell in Dante's Inferno?</i>

20:33.245 --> 20:34.848
Never read it.

20:35.145 --> 20:37.264
I'm more of a Milton fan.

20:37.680 --> 20:40.273
The 9th circle of hell is treachery

20:40.393 --> 20:42.196
and that's kind of perfect isn't it?

20:42.316 --> 20:44.650
Seeing as you wanted revenge on Dante

20:45.084 --> 20:46.292
for being a traitor.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.368
You're wasting your time.

20:48.488 --> 20:51.271
Knows I was below stage.

20:51.736 --> 20:54.807
I know you were below the stage.
What were you doing down there?

20:55.118 --> 20:57.036
I don't know what you're talking about.

20:57.613 --> 20:59.813
You wanted revenge on Dante.

20:59.933 --> 21:02.849
You're grasping at straws.

21:03.257 --> 21:05.503
He broke the magician's oath

21:05.623 --> 21:07.546
and you were gonna make him pay.

21:07.666 --> 21:11.508
So you went below the stage
to sabotage his illusion.

21:23.215 --> 21:25.763
I was nowhere near the Cavern that night.

21:26.138 --> 21:27.347
Hate to disappoint you.

21:27.467 --> 21:30.168
We have a witness who saw you
at the Cavern that evening.

21:30.288 --> 21:33.627
You forget my extraordinary
powers, Mr. Logan.

21:33.747 --> 21:38.674
I know that you're lying.
There was no witness.

21:39.256 --> 21:41.685
Then how do I know that you
had a Phillips screwdriver

21:41.805 --> 21:43.315
and an LED pen light?

21:43.435 --> 21:45.684
Pft. Anyone could guess that.

21:45.804 --> 21:47.698
If you really want to convince me,

21:47.818 --> 21:52.757
you need to be more specific.
The devil is in the details.

21:53.463 --> 21:58.172
OK. I'll tell you exactly
what you wore that night.

21:58.292 --> 21:59.941
Do. Tell.

22:05.276 --> 22:08.298
Blue workpants, black gloves,

22:08.418 --> 22:11.308
a watchman's cap that was
rolled up about an inch.

22:11.428 --> 22:14.511
Brown leather boots
with white rubber soles.

22:14.631 --> 22:16.975
Like you said, the devil is in the details.

22:17.602 --> 22:20.852
- Who did you study under?
- I'm not a mentalist, Miles.

22:20.972 --> 22:25.031
- This isn't about me.
- Well let's make it about you.

22:27.182 --> 22:30.040
<i>Marionette lines around
the mouth mask sadness,</i>

22:30.160 --> 22:32.575
<i>deep loss. Heavy temples, see,</i>

22:32.695 --> 22:35.047
<i>childhood trauma, separation from parents.</i>

22:35.167 --> 22:38.831
<i>Hand over hand covering the deep secret.</i>

22:38.951 --> 22:40.887
I see that you were taken

22:41.007 --> 22:44.970
from your mother at a very early age

22:45.819 --> 22:50.565
or did she leave you?
Either way you have a secret

22:50.685 --> 22:53.368
that you're very anxious to protect.

22:53.488 --> 22:57.389
OK, that's enough. I got it. We're done.

22:57.509 --> 22:59.850
You're free to go, Mr. Mellini.

23:02.527 --> 23:05.260
It's been a pleasure.

23:11.595 --> 23:15.152
- You OK?
- Yeah. That was intense.

23:15.272 --> 23:17.932
Being inside of his head
while he was inside of mine.

23:18.354 --> 23:21.128
I could see him looking at me.

23:21.820 --> 23:25.343
Like a jumbled piece of modern art.

23:26.268 --> 23:28.200
<i>I did a number on him.</i>

23:39.029 --> 23:42.085
Becker? I thought you were
with the superintendent.

23:42.205 --> 23:43.867
It got postponed.

23:43.987 --> 23:46.579
Well, good news. Mellini is
looking good for the murder.

23:46.699 --> 23:48.108
We'll start building
the case in the morning.

23:48.228 --> 23:49.659
- Good.
- It's late.

23:49.779 --> 23:52.510
- I'll see you guys tomorrow.
- Goodnight.

23:54.553 --> 23:56.360
Got somewhere you need to be?

23:56.480 --> 23:58.179
I can make time if it's important.

23:59.428 --> 24:01.776
It is. Let's take a walk.

24:03.309 --> 24:05.320
(Elevator beeps)

24:13.586 --> 24:15.338
What the hell?

24:15.991 --> 24:19.467
I was in observation. I saw what you did.

24:19.587 --> 24:22.170
There's no witness that
saw Mellini at the Cavern,

24:22.290 --> 24:23.831
but somehow you knew he was there.

24:23.951 --> 24:25.978
You knew that he had
a Phillips screwdriver,

24:26.098 --> 24:27.668
that he had white soles on his boots.

24:27.788 --> 24:29.931
You knew the colour of his gloves.

24:30.429 --> 24:32.947
There's no way that you can
read that in someone's face.

24:33.067 --> 24:36.149
- That's impossible.
- There is a science to it.

24:36.269 --> 24:39.320
Oh just shut up, please.
I heard what you said

24:39.440 --> 24:42.311
to McClusky. There was intense pain

24:42.431 --> 24:44.425
inside his head when
he was inside your head.

24:44.545 --> 24:46.077
I know what you're doing.

24:46.197 --> 24:48.259
It's got nothing to do with science.

24:48.379 --> 24:51.024
OK. Then why don't you tell me what it is?

24:51.144 --> 24:54.648
Why don't you just read
it in my face? You tell me.

24:55.501 --> 24:57.855
I know your head must
be spinning right now.

24:58.637 --> 25:00.557
Klein had a tough time with it too,

25:00.677 --> 25:02.348
but in time he accepted what I do

25:02.468 --> 25:04.596
and what I bring to the table.

25:05.931 --> 25:07.502
Look where he is now.

25:17.170 --> 25:18.691
I'm no Klein.

25:21.362 --> 25:23.397
(Elevator beeps)

25:28.351 --> 25:30.991
OK, so Becker knows your secret.

25:31.111 --> 25:32.585
What can he do with that information?

25:32.705 --> 25:35.299
Well he can fire me, he can reassign me

25:35.419 --> 25:37.911
- to another unit, right?
- You know, what worries me is

25:38.031 --> 25:39.685
what if Becker takes it upstairs?

25:39.805 --> 25:41.208
You think the press would believe him?

25:41.328 --> 25:44.198
No. No. I mean, he
would need solid evidence

25:44.318 --> 25:45.738
and we've covered our tracks.

25:45.858 --> 25:47.758
You know, Dev's right. What
if he could take it upstairs?

25:47.878 --> 25:51.182
What if he could convince them
that I'm able to do this thing.

25:51.621 --> 25:52.694
What would they make me do?

25:52.814 --> 25:55.261
Let's not sound the alarm just yet, OK?

25:55.381 --> 25:57.876
I'll talk to Becker tomorrow
once the dust has settled.

25:57.996 --> 26:00.562
- It's going to be fine.
- Thanks.

26:00.682 --> 26:04.032
- I have to go.
- Can I get a ride? - Yeah.

26:10.224 --> 26:11.735
You know, the truth is,

26:12.181 --> 26:14.929
Becker still blames me for Charlie's death.

26:15.699 --> 26:18.520
And that anger is what's fuelling this.

26:18.640 --> 26:21.701
Maybe so, but regardless
of his issues with you,

26:21.821 --> 26:24.887
Becker still needs to recognize
you're a value to the unit.

26:25.321 --> 26:28.275
I hope so. I hope you're right.

26:33.147 --> 26:35.989
- Becker?
- Yep.

26:37.070 --> 26:40.788
- We need to talk about Toby.
- Oh this is a conversation

26:40.908 --> 26:42.325
we should have had weeks ago, huh?

26:42.445 --> 26:46.273
When? On your first day? You
would have laughed in my face.

26:48.466 --> 26:52.139
Look, I know it's hard to
process, OK? I've been there.

26:52.259 --> 26:54.806
But now you know so, so let's move forward.

26:54.926 --> 26:58.654
Move forward? Who else knows about this?

26:58.774 --> 27:01.088
Myself, Klein, Dev,

27:01.208 --> 27:03.695
his best-friend Oz and
his girlfriend, Tia.

27:03.815 --> 27:07.039
You do realize that what
he does tramples all over

27:07.159 --> 27:08.929
many of the protections built
into the legal system, right?

27:09.049 --> 27:11.130
That's why we use his gift judiciously.

27:11.250 --> 27:13.728
Well I doubt that the legal
community would see it that way.

27:13.848 --> 27:15.687
If they ever found out
about Toby's ability,

27:15.807 --> 27:18.561
they would want to rip open every single one
of the cases that he's ever been a part of.

27:18.681 --> 27:20.306
Our casework is thorough, OK?

27:20.426 --> 27:22.627
We back all of Toby's reads
up with solid evidence.

27:22.747 --> 27:24.429
- Oh is that right?
- Yeah, I challenge you.

27:24.549 --> 27:26.565
Go through any single one of
our cases with a fine-tooth comb.

27:26.685 --> 27:29.502
You will not find one piece
of unsubstantiated police work.

27:29.622 --> 27:34.117
Hey. Guys, Dev and Alex
want to show us something.

27:34.237 --> 27:38.758
- It's important.
- Alright.

27:41.414 --> 27:44.750
- Good conversation with Becker?
- Yeah. He'll come around.

27:45.607 --> 27:48.653
This is a 3D rendering of Dante's Inferno.

27:48.773 --> 27:51.022
Using photogrammetry, we ran the apparatus

27:51.142 --> 27:53.548
through several simulations
to test Vaughn's theory.

27:53.668 --> 27:55.720
And he was proved right. The
gears could have been jammed

27:55.840 --> 27:58.624
using a 10mm nail, but a
metal nail would have left

27:58.744 --> 28:01.665
tell-tale signs, such as
metal dust or scrapings.

28:01.785 --> 28:03.669
The only rational
explanation is that the object

28:03.789 --> 28:06.292
- wasn't metal at all.
- So we tried other objects

28:06.412 --> 28:09.581
made from rubbers and plastics
and various types of polymers.

28:09.701 --> 28:11.707
And nothing worked. Finally we wondered

28:11.827 --> 28:14.910
if the object wasn't made
from an inorganic compound,

28:15.030 --> 28:18.609
but rather from an organic
substance commonly found

28:18.729 --> 28:22.617
on a magic stage
- dry ice.

28:25.985 --> 28:28.967
It worked. This is brilliant.

28:29.493 --> 28:32.282
This belt is strong enough to jam the motor

28:32.402 --> 28:35.345
but not so strong as to strip the gears.

28:35.465 --> 28:36.733
Which would account for the lack

28:36.853 --> 28:38.997
- of scrapings and metal dust.
- And there is a freezer full

28:39.117 --> 28:42.142
of dry ice pellets not 10 feet away.

28:42.262 --> 28:45.733
See? Already it begins to sublimate.

28:46.105 --> 28:48.547
Within seconds it will
vanish into thin air,

28:48.667 --> 28:51.699
- leaving no trace.
- Solid theory.

28:51.819 --> 28:53.740
That puts a timeline restriction on the act

28:53.860 --> 28:55.809
of sabotage. The killer had to be standing

28:55.929 --> 28:58.988
right here beneath the platform
minutes before it started turning.

28:59.108 --> 29:00.867
Well we know Mellini could have been here

29:00.987 --> 29:03.108
at exactly that time.
Everyone else was either

29:03.228 --> 29:06.793
- on stage or in the audience.
- You are making assumption.

29:06.913 --> 29:09.032
You're assuming that
everyone who was present

29:09.152 --> 29:12.521
in the theatre was actually present.

29:12.641 --> 29:15.876
- What do you mean?
- I have only an idea.

29:16.644 --> 29:17.873
Let me work it out.

29:17.993 --> 29:21.652
<i>Inside, outside switch. Two places at once.</i>

29:21.772 --> 29:24.379
<i>Girl to gorilla. Pepper's ghost.</i>

29:26.977 --> 29:28.924
Well give us a call when you get something.

29:35.124 --> 29:37.057
So according to my calculations the dry ice

29:37.177 --> 29:39.392
would have completely
sublimated within 5 minutes.

29:39.512 --> 29:42.059
So that means the killer was
under the stage during the show.

29:42.179 --> 29:44.209
That takes Dante Blake right off the table.

29:44.329 --> 29:46.303
And Ashley who was on the stage with him

29:46.423 --> 29:50.037
- the whole time.
- What about Samantha Barclay?

29:50.157 --> 29:55.720
Well, this is a view from
a closed circuit camera

29:55.840 --> 29:56.943
that's pointing from the stage.

29:57.063 --> 29:58.783
As you can see, Samantha
never leaves her seat.

29:58.903 --> 30:02.492
Which leaves us with Mellini,
who wasn't at the gala.

30:02.612 --> 30:08.682
Now I got a feeling, actually,
I got a read from Mellini

30:08.802 --> 30:10.848
and it puts him beneath
the stage looking up

30:10.968 --> 30:13.212
at Dante's Inferno.

30:15.050 --> 30:16.896
- Corporal Clark.
- Sir.

30:17.016 --> 30:20.193
We need to bring Mellini for
interrogation. Send a unit.

30:20.313 --> 30:22.886
- Copy that.
- Becker, d'you have a minute? - Yep.

30:25.311 --> 30:28.844
- Have a seat.
- I see you've been

30:28.964 --> 30:30.887
going over our case files.

30:31.007 --> 30:33.681
Yeah they're solid. They're all backed up.

30:33.801 --> 30:37.230
Evidence. Eye witness accounts.

30:37.350 --> 30:40.567
Confessions. Can't fault your work.

30:40.687 --> 30:43.844
So issue resolved, right?
We can move forward.

30:47.717 --> 30:48.431
No. No I don't think

30:48.551 --> 30:51.541
that Logan can remain a part of this unit.

30:51.661 --> 30:53.275
This unit has one of the best solve ratios

30:53.395 --> 30:55.551
in the entire country.
You don't think the Brass

30:55.671 --> 30:58.195
will have something to say
about you shuffling Toby out?

30:58.315 --> 31:00.507
I don't think the Brass
actually know who Toby is,

31:00.627 --> 31:02.421
and that's a good thing.

31:03.184 --> 31:04.157
You sure this has nothing to do

31:04.277 --> 31:06.601
with your old partner, Charlie?

31:06.721 --> 31:08.602
You don't wanna go there, Michelle.

31:09.236 --> 31:11.049
This is not about Charlie,
it's not about the past;

31:11.169 --> 31:12.802
it's about the here and the now.

31:12.922 --> 31:16.416
What we are doing as a team, now.

31:15.858 --> 31:17.993
You sure about that?

31:19.375 --> 31:21.410
Working with a mind reader, or a psychic

31:21.530 --> 31:24.508
or whatever it is you
call him, that's risky.

31:24.628 --> 31:27.074
If this ever gets out, it
comes back on all of us.

31:27.194 --> 31:28.342
Big time.

31:28.462 --> 31:31.002
Well I didn't get into
policing to have a career.

31:31.122 --> 31:32.599
I got into this to make a difference.

31:32.719 --> 31:34.926
- Oh, please.
- And that's exactly what this unit does.

31:35.046 --> 31:37.680
Now because of Toby's ability
we've been able to solve crimes

31:37.800 --> 31:39.460
that never would have been solved.

31:39.580 --> 31:41.894
To give closure to victims
who never would have had it.

31:42.014 --> 31:44.219
That's what we do here in this unit.

31:44.339 --> 31:45.904
So if you want to be a part of that,

31:46.024 --> 31:48.605
then you need to get over
your issues with Toby.

32:07.555 --> 32:09.149
(Laughs)

32:09.269 --> 32:11.357
(Sound of door opening)

32:21.365 --> 32:23.146
Vaughn was taken out by a single gunshot

32:23.266 --> 32:23.967
to the chest.

32:24.087 --> 32:26.579
Amy puts the time of death
at approximately 9:45.

32:26.699 --> 32:28.529
- Witnesses?
- The cleaner upstairs

32:28.649 --> 32:30.721
heard the shot and called 911.
By the time Metro got here,

32:30.841 --> 32:33.065
- the killer was long gone.
- What about surveillance?

32:33.185 --> 32:34.928
I already checked the
tapes. There's nothing.

32:35.048 --> 32:36.695
Seems our killer knew what they were doing.

32:36.815 --> 32:37.959
Didn't really leave us
anything to work with.

32:38.079 --> 32:40.511
Even picked up the shell
casing. But, they didn't check

32:40.631 --> 32:42.851
Vaughn's body 'cause if they did,

32:42.971 --> 32:46.228
they would have found this
- a piece of Mylar.

32:46.348 --> 32:48.182
It was tucked inside Vaughn's coat.

32:48.302 --> 32:50.567
Also found some matching
fragments against the wall.

32:50.687 --> 32:52.749
I uh, read Vaughn and
he was thinking "in two

32:52.869 --> 32:57.048
"places at once", "girl to
gorilla" and "Pepper's ghost".

32:57.168 --> 32:59.050
You think you can do anything with that?

32:59.483 --> 33:01.228
Yeah let me see what I can do.

33:01.348 --> 33:03.230
Mellini knows his way around the building

33:03.350 --> 33:05.514
and he knows how to cover his tracks.

33:06.064 --> 33:08.310
But even for someone
with Mellini's skillset

33:08.430 --> 33:11.763
- this is a risky move.
- Maybe he likes toying with us.

33:11.883 --> 33:14.692
- But why kill Vaughn?
- He knew Vaughn was onto him.

33:14.812 --> 33:17.812
In cold blood. It lacks a magician's flair.

33:17.932 --> 33:19.269
I don't know, maybe
you're overthinking this.

33:19.389 --> 33:21.448
You know we have Mellini
waiting for us in interrogation

33:21.568 --> 33:23.282
let's see if we can get him to crack.

33:32.243 --> 33:34.774
My powers of perception tell me that you,

33:34.894 --> 33:38.031
sergeant, have already
decided that I'm guilty.

33:38.504 --> 33:40.374
But I get the feeling

33:40.494 --> 33:44.835
that you, Mr. Logan, aren't so convinced.

33:44.955 --> 33:47.798
Where were you last night at 9:45?

33:48.742 --> 33:50.598
I was working on some new material.

33:59.611 --> 34:02.575
No you weren't. You were drinking. Alone.

34:02.695 --> 34:05.760
So you've got no alibi
for Vaughn's homicide.

34:06.296 --> 34:07.786
Your alibi for the night of the gala

34:07.906 --> 34:11.502
didn't check out either. So you're
looking good for two homicides.

34:12.329 --> 34:15.232
You have no leverage
here other than the truth.

34:15.351 --> 34:18.281
- I've told you the truth.
- No, you haven't.

34:18.400 --> 34:21.230
We know you were below
the stage at the gala.

34:21.350 --> 34:23.675
What were you doing there?

34:24.841 --> 34:29.518
I was below the stage,
yes. But not at the gala.

34:29.639 --> 34:33.389
I was there the night before at 5am.

34:33.991 --> 34:36.379
I broke in, I took photos,

34:36.498 --> 34:38.304
I made notes, I drew diagrams.

34:38.425 --> 34:42.789
- I took exactly what I needed.
- I don't follow.

34:43.558 --> 34:46.333
I was stealing Dante's secrets.

34:46.453 --> 34:49.498
I wanted to do to him what he did to me

34:49.956 --> 34:53.440
and sell them to another magician.

34:54.527 --> 34:58.215
When Dante sold my secrets,

34:58.335 --> 35:01.149
my act became old hat.

35:01.269 --> 35:03.416
I can't get booked anymore.

35:03.536 --> 35:08.212
I have an ex-wife and
two children to support.

35:08.332 --> 35:11.218
Why didn't you tell us this before?

35:11.338 --> 35:13.570
I was ashamed.

35:13.690 --> 35:16.763
I lowered myself to his level.

35:17.609 --> 35:19.702
I broke the oath.

35:21.472 --> 35:24.363
I can never forgive myself for that.

35:25.500 --> 35:27.222
My read's backed up everything he said,

35:27.342 --> 35:28.693
I don't think Mellini killed anybody.

35:28.813 --> 35:31.337
- I'm with Toby.
- Well for once, I agree.

35:31.457 --> 35:33.614
Where does that leave us? No suspects.

35:33.734 --> 35:35.432
OK guys I have something
that I think will turn

35:35.552 --> 35:38.332
those frowns upside down.

35:39.205 --> 35:43.295
I think our killer was
a ghost. Pepper's ghost.

35:43.415 --> 35:46.758
Pepper's ghost. I got
Vaughn thinking about that.

35:46.878 --> 35:47.566
Check this out.

35:47.686 --> 35:51.033
This dude is John Henry Pepper, OK?

35:51.153 --> 35:53.009
He perfected a technique in the 1800s

35:53.129 --> 35:56.827
that changed magic forever. If you...

35:56.947 --> 36:02.049
line up a mirror or a
sheet of Plexiglas or Mylar,

36:02.169 --> 36:04.032
and angle the light just so

36:04.152 --> 36:06.810
you can morph objects into each other.

36:06.930 --> 36:09.598
Or make them appear or disappear, OK?

36:09.718 --> 36:11.567
Pepper's ghost has been used in illusions

36:11.687 --> 36:15.110
for hundreds of years. Even
today, the same principles

36:15.230 --> 36:18.706
were used to "resurrect"
Tupac at Coachella.

36:18.826 --> 36:20.161
Where are you going with this, corporal?

36:20.281 --> 36:22.667
Well. Vaughn found a piece of Mylar

36:22.787 --> 36:24.867
at the back of the auditorium.
I did forensics on it,

36:24.987 --> 36:26.975
and what I found was, it's
a specialized form of Mylar.

36:27.095 --> 36:29.535
Specifically designed to reflect holograms.

36:29.655 --> 36:34.326
OK, so a projection at the right angle

36:34.446 --> 36:36.467
would make it appear as though the killer

36:36.587 --> 36:38.278
was standing at the back of the house.

36:38.398 --> 36:42.260
But in fact, he was beneath
the stage at the exact moment,

36:42.380 --> 36:45.490
sabotaging the trick. When he was done,

36:45.610 --> 36:48.158
he went back to his original spot

36:48.278 --> 36:49.528
and no one ever knew he was gone.

36:49.648 --> 36:56.975
Exactly. Now, so who was
at the back of the house?

36:57.095 --> 36:58.829
OK let me show you a camera angle

36:58.949 --> 37:02.248
from the stage pointed at the audience.

37:02.368 --> 37:06.167
Steve Parrish, the owner
of the Magic Cavern.

37:06.287 --> 37:08.583
But he loved him like a
brother, why would he kill him?

37:08.703 --> 37:11.726
That's the 250 million dollar question.

37:17.464 --> 37:20.709
Guys, I might be high on cheesy
poofs, but I think I found something.

37:21.776 --> 37:23.001
Found an email trail

37:23.121 --> 37:25.448
between Parrish and a
real estate developer.

37:25.568 --> 37:27.571
It seems Parrish had the developer lined up

37:27.691 --> 37:31.639
for a sale. Lucrative, too.
But then it fell through.

37:31.759 --> 37:34.544
In an email, Parrish
alludes to a heavy hitter

37:34.664 --> 37:36.128
on the board who blocked the sale

37:36.248 --> 37:40.787
and this same heavy hitter
is referred to as FB.

37:40.907 --> 37:42.104
Felix Barclay.

37:42.224 --> 37:45.296
Parrish is the majority owner,
why didn't he just push it through?

37:45.416 --> 37:48.173
For a sale, Parrish needs the
unanimous approval of the board.

37:48.293 --> 37:51.697
- And Felix was the chairman.
- Well apparently,

37:51.817 --> 37:54.508
Felix had been making noise
about having the Cavern

37:54.628 --> 37:57.061
- declared a heritage site.
- Once a building becomes

37:57.181 --> 37:59.753
a heritage site, it's
almost impossible to sell.

37:59.873 --> 38:01.871
- Yeah.
- So, maybe Parrish thought

38:01.991 --> 38:05.580
he had no other choice than
to get rid of his friend.

38:05.700 --> 38:08.057
So we can establish motive,
means and opportunity.

38:08.177 --> 38:10.070
But that's not enough.

38:10.190 --> 38:12.147
Well we've gone over the forensics

38:12.267 --> 38:17.166
and there's no witnesses,
no video surveillance

38:17.286 --> 38:19.458
no physical evidence linking
him to either of the murders.

38:19.578 --> 38:22.408
Without solid evidence there's
only one way to convict:

38:22.528 --> 38:24.671
confession. We gotta hit
him with everything we got

38:24.791 --> 38:27.402
- and hope he cracks.
- Parrish is careful

38:27.522 --> 38:31.564
and calculating, he is going
to be a tough nut to crack.

38:31.684 --> 38:33.149
If he thinks he's talking to us,

38:33.269 --> 38:36.528
but what if he's talking to a ghost?

38:36.648 --> 38:39.437
I told you this was going
to be the coolest case ever.

38:39.557 --> 38:42.072
Steven? It's Miles Mellini.

38:42.192 --> 38:44.157
<i>Mellini? Do you know what time it is?</i>

38:44.277 --> 38:47.455
<i>- Can't this wait 'til morning?
- What I have to say won't wait.</i>

38:47.575 --> 38:50.566
I know what you did to Felix Barclay

38:50.686 --> 38:53.557
<i>- and to Tomas Vaughn.
- I'm hanging up.</i>

38:53.677 --> 38:55.763
Then I'll have to call
the police and you'll spend

38:55.883 --> 38:58.307
the rest of your life rotting in prison.

38:58.427 --> 39:01.370
Now I suspect that your freedom

39:01.490 --> 39:02.833
is worth a lot to you.

39:02.953 --> 39:07.261
So I'm prepared to hear an offer.

39:07.381 --> 39:09.759
<i>I'm not saying another
word on an unsecure line</i>

39:09.879 --> 39:12.233
<i>- We need to meet.
- Perfect.</i>

39:12.353 --> 39:17.169
The Cavern in an hour.
Don't forget your check book.

39:20.887 --> 39:21.818
You think he bought it?

39:21.938 --> 39:23.837
We'll soon find out.

39:30.019 --> 39:31.832
Let's just get this over with, Mellini.

39:31.952 --> 39:34.380
What's the hurry? You worked very hard

39:34.500 --> 39:37.215
to make this happen. Now's your chance

39:37.335 --> 39:39.246
to get some kudos.

39:39.366 --> 39:41.321
I don't need praise from
a washed up mentalist.

39:41.441 --> 39:42.776
Just get to the point.

39:42.896 --> 39:45.879
The point is I know what you did.

39:45.999 --> 39:47.950
You used Pepper's ghost to make it look

39:48.070 --> 39:51.261
like you were in two places at once.

39:51.381 --> 39:53.162
Nicely done, Steven.

39:53.282 --> 39:57.054
Who knew you had such a sleight of hand?

39:57.174 --> 39:59.677
But please, tell me.

39:59.797 --> 40:04.170
- Why did you kill Felix Barclay?
- Who said I did?

40:04.290 --> 40:07.571
Oh come on, Steven. Don't be coy.

40:07.691 --> 40:12.453
The very fact that you're
here is an admission of guilt.

40:13.365 --> 40:15.851
You'd think a financial genius like Felix

40:15.971 --> 40:18.340
would recognize that
the land beneath our feet

40:18.460 --> 40:20.764
is worth millions to developers.

40:20.884 --> 40:22.762
I've turned down dozens
of offers over the years,

40:22.882 --> 40:26.861
but this last offer? Once
in a lifetime kind of thing.

40:26.981 --> 40:30.933
So he didn't want you to
sell? And used his power

40:31.053 --> 40:36.002
on the board to block it. And Tomas Vaughn?

40:36.122 --> 40:38.847
You were just covering your tracks?

40:38.967 --> 40:40.853
I did what I needed to do and it's over.

40:40.973 --> 40:46.203
Not quite. There's the matter
of compensation for my silence.

40:46.617 --> 40:48.540
sI hope that you've thought long and hard

40:48.660 --> 40:51.613
about how much your
freedom is worth to you.

40:51.733 --> 40:53.720
It's worth quite a lot.

40:59.067 --> 41:02.991
- Drop the gun, now!
- Put the gun down, now!

41:08.399 --> 41:11.347
Let's go. C'mon.

41:20.167 --> 41:22.426
You do realize we never
would have closed this case

41:22.546 --> 41:25.950
without Toby, right?

41:26.070 --> 41:29.144
- I'm aware.
- Good.

41:33.146 --> 41:35.642
Thank you, Miles. We owe you.

41:36.922 --> 41:41.018
And I know precisely how you can repay me.

41:41.510 --> 41:44.807
I've been thinking about
your mentalism technique,

41:44.927 --> 41:49.456
I can't figure out how you do it and
it... it's driving me to distraction.

41:51.130 --> 41:53.325
What's your secret?

41:53.445 --> 41:56.174
It's very simple. I'm psychic.

42:02.225 --> 42:03.757
I understand.

42:04.571 --> 42:08.373
A magician must never reveal his secrets.

42:11.218 --> 42:15.326
But, give me enough time
and I'll figure it out.

42:15.446 --> 42:17.108
You got it.

42:20.225 --> 42:21.799
You did some good work on this case.

42:21.919 --> 42:22.730
Thank you.

42:27.676 --> 42:30.708
You know, I'm not
comfortable with your ability.

42:32.040 --> 42:35.081
But I'm willing to let you
continue working for the unit.

42:35.201 --> 42:37.616
Well, good. I'm glad.

42:38.421 --> 42:41.942
Being a part of this unit
is very important to me.

42:42.062 --> 42:43.745
- OK.
- Actually, one more thing.

42:43.865 --> 42:44.856
- Becker...
- Yeah?

42:44.976 --> 42:47.300
Becker, you don't have to like
me. You don't have to be my friend.

42:47.420 --> 42:50.394
I just need you to respect
what I bring to the table.

42:51.591 --> 42:53.053
I can do that.
