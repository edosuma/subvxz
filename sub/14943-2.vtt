WEBVTT

00:02.333 --> 00:03.403
Previously on "body of proof"...

00:03.404 --> 00:04.574
Welcome back.

00:04.575 --> 00:06.136
You will be working with
a new homicide team.

00:06.137 --> 00:06.707
Try to start off on the
right foot this time. Megan.

00:06.708 --> 00:08.438
Tommy.

00:08.439 --> 00:10.410
You have five seconds to
tell me what you're doing here.

00:10.411 --> 00:11.611
There was an opening. I took it.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.613
Whatever you thought was
gonna happen between us,

00:13.614 --> 00:15.486
it's not.

00:16.717 --> 00:18.448
(Megan) They're combat veterans.

00:18.449 --> 00:20.350
We've got a serial
killer targeting veterans.

00:20.351 --> 00:22.692
All five men had their
spleens removed surgically.

00:22.693 --> 00:24.624
So you're saying our
killer's a plastic surgeon.

00:24.625 --> 00:25.695
Do you work for Dr. Wallace?

00:25.696 --> 00:27.357
I'm his chief nurse.

00:27.358 --> 00:28.528
Yvonne, what's going on?

00:28.529 --> 00:30.660
I just handed you a
guy with means, motive,

00:30.661 --> 00:32.432
and you're letting him go.

00:32.433 --> 00:33.533
Mr. Simmons, we know
this guy's targeting veterans.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.435
You're name is on a list.

00:35.436 --> 00:36.666
Just put me in front
of the son of a bitch.

00:36.667 --> 00:38.668
I'll show you what a vet can do.

00:38.669 --> 00:41.341
Megan, I know
where your killer is.

00:41.342 --> 00:43.413
This guy's gonna bleed
out if I don't close him up.

00:43.414 --> 00:44.444
It's Karl Simmons.

00:44.445 --> 00:46.446
Don't you dare die on me.

00:46.447 --> 00:48.418
It's over, doc. You don't
understand. They made me do it.

00:48.419 --> 00:50.680
I didn't want to
help them. I had to.

00:50.681 --> 00:52.422
The police got their man.

00:52.423 --> 00:54.554
You performed lifesaving
emergency surgery.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.356
What else could be happening?

00:56.357 --> 00:57.687
Their spleens were
removed so something else

00:57.688 --> 00:59.589
could be put in their place.

00:59.590 --> 01:01.631
There's no way one person
could run those machines

01:01.632 --> 01:03.693
and perform surgery
at the same time.

01:03.694 --> 01:05.666
For once in your life,
don't overthink this.

01:07.368 --> 01:09.399
(Tires squeal)

01:09.400 --> 01:10.640
Ah! No!

01:10.641 --> 01:11.641
(Cries)

01:11.642 --> 01:13.344
You won't feel a thing.

01:14.475 --> 01:16.346
Who's that?
Dr. Wallace's last victim.

01:16.347 --> 01:17.578
(Muffled voice) No!

01:45.576 --> 01:46.707
What the...

01:52.413 --> 01:54.585
A bomb?

01:56.517 --> 01:59.349
(Cell phone rings)

01:59.350 --> 02:02.422
(Ring)

02:02.423 --> 02:03.453
(Instrument clatters)

02:03.454 --> 02:04.494
(Ring)

02:04.495 --> 02:05.525
(Snaps glove)

02:05.526 --> 02:07.627
Hey, lace.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.600
(Distorted male voice) Dr. Hunt?

02:12.403 --> 02:13.733
Who is this?

02:13.734 --> 02:15.565
You stuck your nose...

02:15.566 --> 02:16.736
(Normal voice) Where
it doesn't belong.

02:16.737 --> 02:18.438
Now I have your daughter.

02:18.439 --> 02:19.569
(Distorted male voice)
And you're gonna do

02:19.570 --> 02:22.712
exactly what I say,
or else she dies.

02:22.713 --> 02:24.444
(Beeps)

02:24.445 --> 02:26.446
(Snaps)

02:26.447 --> 02:27.517
Ow!

02:27.518 --> 02:28.848
Lacey. Mom!

02:28.849 --> 02:30.420
Lacey, are you all right?
Talk to me. I'm okay.

02:30.421 --> 02:31.551
I-I don't know where I am.

02:31.552 --> 02:32.622
(Snaps, beeps) Enough.

02:32.623 --> 02:35.685
Who are you? Why
are you doing this?

02:35.686 --> 02:37.487
I'm gonna ask you questions,

02:37.488 --> 02:38.688
and you're gonna
tell me the truth.

02:38.689 --> 02:41.361
Do you understand, yes or no?

02:41.362 --> 02:42.462
Yes.

02:42.463 --> 02:45.435
You found what was
implanted in the body.

02:45.436 --> 02:46.496
Yes.

02:46.497 --> 02:48.638
And you know why
those men were killed?

02:48.639 --> 02:50.370
Please, my daughter. She...

02:50.371 --> 02:51.701
Tell me, Dr. Hunt.

02:51.702 --> 02:53.673
The... the men,
they... they were...

02:53.674 --> 02:57.707
They were Guinea pigs to
perfect implanting the bomb.

02:57.708 --> 02:59.449
Does anyone else know?

02:59.450 --> 03:01.551
No. No, it... it... it didn't
turn up on the x-rays.

03:01.552 --> 03:04.484
Th-that's the point, isn't it?

03:04.485 --> 03:07.517
You're gonna remove
the device from the body.

03:07.518 --> 03:11.461
I'm sending a signal
to deactivate it now.

03:11.462 --> 03:13.593
(Beeps)

03:13.594 --> 03:15.695
Now you're gonna

03:15.696 --> 03:17.427
bring it to me.

03:17.428 --> 03:18.568
Please, my daughter...
My daughter...

03:18.569 --> 03:19.769
She has an Insulin pump.

03:19.770 --> 03:21.731
It needs to be refilled
in a couple of hours.

03:21.732 --> 03:23.633
Sooner if she's under stress.

03:23.634 --> 03:25.505
Well, do what I say,

03:25.506 --> 03:26.706
and I'll release her.

03:26.707 --> 03:29.709
But if anyone finds
out about me, she dies.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.381
Are we clear?

03:31.382 --> 03:32.512
Yes, but you need to realize,

03:32.513 --> 03:34.514
the police know
that somebody else

03:34.515 --> 03:37.387
was helping Dr. Wallace
with the operation.

03:37.388 --> 03:38.688
And how do they know that,

03:38.689 --> 03:40.490
because you told them?

03:40.491 --> 03:42.452
I...

03:42.453 --> 03:44.554
How unfortunate. (Beeps)

03:44.555 --> 03:46.427
No, wait. Please. No, stop.

03:47.698 --> 03:49.529
You okay?

03:49.530 --> 03:50.730
(Gasps)

03:50.731 --> 03:52.732
What's going on, Megan?

03:52.733 --> 03:56.436
Just... it's personal.

03:56.437 --> 03:59.369
Are you sure you're not
taking on too much too fast?

03:59.370 --> 04:00.470
Just get out.

04:00.471 --> 04:02.372
Leave me alone.

04:02.373 --> 04:03.573
Mind your own business.

04:03.574 --> 04:05.475
Go.

04:05.476 --> 04:07.647
(Sighs)

04:07.648 --> 04:08.718
(Inhales deeply)

04:08.719 --> 04:11.552
(Exhales)

04:13.654 --> 04:15.585
(Woman) Early this morning,

04:15.586 --> 04:18.458
Philadelphia police
launched a daring raid

04:18.459 --> 04:19.759
to apprehend Dr. Harvey Wallace,

04:19.760 --> 04:24.394
a man suspected of at
least six serial murders.

04:24.395 --> 04:26.396
Wallace was killed
in the operation,

04:26.397 --> 04:29.499
but police managed to
save the life of his next victim,

04:29.500 --> 04:31.601
army staff sergeant
Karl Simmons,

04:31.602 --> 04:34.444
a veteran of the
war in Afghanistan.

04:34.445 --> 04:36.476
(Telephone rings, button
clicks) Kate Murphy.

04:36.477 --> 04:37.647
I just had an
unpleasant phone call

04:37.648 --> 04:39.379
from the FBI

04:39.380 --> 04:40.650
about the Wallace case.

04:40.651 --> 04:42.652
What's the problem, that
we solved it without 'em?

04:42.653 --> 04:44.454
They feel like we've

04:44.455 --> 04:45.585
shut them out of
the investigation,

04:45.586 --> 04:47.387
so now they're going
to go over everything

04:47.388 --> 04:48.588
with a fine-tooth comb.

04:48.589 --> 04:50.590
Okay. My point is

04:50.591 --> 04:52.722
that we need to make sure we
have all the loose ends tied up,

04:52.723 --> 04:54.394
for your sake.

04:54.395 --> 04:55.495
My sake?

04:55.496 --> 04:56.626
You took the
victory lap on this,

04:56.627 --> 04:58.398
gave your press conference.

04:58.399 --> 04:59.529
If this case blows up,

04:59.530 --> 05:00.900
you're the one who's
going to get hurt,

05:00.901 --> 05:03.503
and neither of us wants
that. (Cell phone chirps)

05:03.504 --> 05:05.605
I have to take this
call. Keep me posted.

05:05.606 --> 05:06.706
(Dial tone drones)

05:06.707 --> 05:08.538
(Clicks button)

05:08.539 --> 05:10.440
Did Megan finish the autopsy
on Wallace's last victim?

05:10.441 --> 05:12.442
No, and she's out of her mind.

05:12.443 --> 05:13.783
Ripped my head
off when I looked in.

05:13.784 --> 05:15.646
Something's up with her.

05:22.723 --> 05:24.594
What?

05:24.595 --> 05:27.597
When do you think you'll
be done with your autopsy?

05:27.598 --> 05:30.430
Depends on how many
people barge in and disturb me.

05:30.431 --> 05:32.602
I know you had some concerns
about the Wallace case.

05:32.603 --> 05:34.604
I just want to
make sure I didn't

05:34.605 --> 05:36.536
unfairly dismiss them.

05:36.537 --> 05:38.568
You weren't. We're fine.

05:38.569 --> 05:40.570
So what about your
theory that Wallace

05:40.571 --> 05:42.712
was implanting
something into the victims?

05:42.713 --> 05:44.474
It's a theory.

05:44.475 --> 05:46.446
So you have another
explanation for the surgical mesh

05:46.447 --> 05:47.577
you found in the bodies?

05:47.578 --> 05:49.619
My explanation is that
Wallace was insane,

05:49.620 --> 05:53.524
and we can't begin to
understand why he did what he did.

05:55.426 --> 05:56.556
What?

05:56.557 --> 05:57.787
I have never known you

05:57.788 --> 06:00.430
to turn your back on an
unanswered question, ever.

06:00.431 --> 06:03.463
Maybe I'm learning from you.

06:03.464 --> 06:04.734
Excuse me? Couple of hours ago,

06:04.735 --> 06:06.736
all you cared about was
your press conference,

06:06.737 --> 06:08.738
and now all of a sudden, you're
worried about doing your job?

06:08.739 --> 06:10.440
What happened?

06:10.441 --> 06:11.601
Did somebody tell you
you should cover your ass?

06:11.602 --> 06:13.504
I resent that. Good.

06:27.618 --> 06:29.459
(Cell phone rings)

06:29.460 --> 06:31.621
Dr. Murphy.

06:31.622 --> 06:34.494
Yes.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.696
Okay, where?

06:36.697 --> 06:38.498
All right. I'll send
a team right out.

06:38.499 --> 06:40.399
Thanks. (Beeps)

06:40.400 --> 06:41.701
Police are calling for an m.E.

06:41.702 --> 06:43.402
Homicide in greenbury park.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.404
Take Ethan. I'll handle
the autopsy from here.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.636
That's my case.

06:46.637 --> 06:49.440
Not anymore. I need to
make sure it's done right.

06:58.719 --> 07:01.651
(Police radio chatter)

07:01.652 --> 07:02.792
This one's rough.

07:02.793 --> 07:05.655
Victim's just a kid...
15, 16 years old,

07:05.656 --> 07:07.498
a Caucasian female.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.561
(Distorted male voice)
Do exactly what I say

07:11.562 --> 07:13.563
or else she dies.

07:13.564 --> 07:14.634
Ow!

07:14.635 --> 07:16.766
You got a name?

07:16.767 --> 07:19.709
We're waiting for you
to examine the body.

07:19.710 --> 07:22.743
(Radio chatter continues)

07:32.553 --> 07:36.527
♪♪♪

07:40.961 --> 07:42.932
(People speaking indistinctly)

07:42.933 --> 07:44.765
You okay?

07:46.767 --> 07:48.698
Turn her over.

07:48.699 --> 07:49.969
But I haven't
done the g.S.R. Kit.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.071
Just do it.

07:52.703 --> 07:54.905
(Snaps glove)

08:01.051 --> 08:02.782
(Exhales)

08:02.783 --> 08:04.784
Makes you hope there's
a special place in hell

08:04.785 --> 08:07.787
for somebody who could do this.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.789
Wait a second.

08:09.790 --> 08:10.920
I've seen her before.

08:10.921 --> 08:14.023
She's in a picture in
Dr. Wallace's office.

08:14.024 --> 08:15.795
This his daughter?

08:15.796 --> 08:17.026
Yeah. Alyssa Wallace.

08:17.027 --> 08:18.798
(Adam) Detective Sullivan,

08:18.799 --> 08:21.070
they found tire
tracks further back.

08:21.071 --> 08:22.732
Congratulations.

08:22.733 --> 08:24.704
I'll call the commissioner.

08:24.705 --> 08:26.706
This kid's impressed
with everything he does.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.878
(Cell phone rings)

08:28.879 --> 08:31.982
(Ring)

08:33.083 --> 08:36.716
(Ring)

08:36.717 --> 08:38.848
You are sick. She was a child.

08:38.849 --> 08:41.891
(Distorted male voice) I see
you found Dr. Wallace's daughter.

08:41.892 --> 08:43.753
(Normal voice) That
was for your benefit,

08:43.754 --> 08:45.024
so you know I'm serious.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.756
Do you have the device?

08:46.757 --> 08:48.027
Yes.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.860
There's a parking structure
at McKinnon and third.

08:50.861 --> 08:52.862
Go to the top floor. You'll
get further instructions then.

08:52.863 --> 08:54.864
No. I can't do it now.
I need more time.

08:54.865 --> 08:55.935
Not acceptable.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.166
Well, you shouldn't
have killed her then.

08:57.167 --> 08:58.938
If I leave now, people
are gonna get suspicious.

08:58.939 --> 09:00.770
I can do it by 8:00.

09:00.771 --> 09:01.841
Be there at 7:00.

09:01.842 --> 09:02.913
(Beeps)

09:07.878 --> 09:11.852
(Jet engines roaring)

09:21.792 --> 09:24.965
(Voice breaking) Why
are you doing this?

09:26.697 --> 09:28.067
For my husband.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.799
What does that mean?

09:29.800 --> 09:31.941
There was never
anyone else for me.

09:31.942 --> 09:35.845
He was the love of my
life since the day we met.

09:35.846 --> 09:38.878
He served his country...
Three tours in Afghanistan.

09:38.879 --> 09:40.980
He was a hero.

09:40.981 --> 09:43.783
And then he came home.

09:43.784 --> 09:46.055
And he needed help.

09:46.056 --> 09:49.719
I don't understand.

09:49.720 --> 09:51.861
He killed himself

09:51.862 --> 09:54.924
because no one gave a damn.

09:54.925 --> 09:56.966
So everything that
we talked about,

09:56.967 --> 09:59.729
our... our plans and
having a family...

09:59.730 --> 10:03.933
None of it was ever
going to happen.

10:03.934 --> 10:06.105
He lost his life.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.879
And I lost everything.

10:09.940 --> 10:12.912
But his sacrifice
won't be forgotten.

10:12.913 --> 10:17.847
Killing people isn't going
to bring your husband back.

10:17.848 --> 10:19.789
No.

10:19.790 --> 10:22.792
It won't.

10:22.793 --> 10:26.797
But it's the only way
anything ever gets done.

10:29.930 --> 10:31.831
(Man shouts indistinctly)

10:31.832 --> 10:34.003
The liver's still warm.

10:34.004 --> 10:36.966
She was likely killed
in the last three hours...

10:36.967 --> 10:40.039
Which is after her father died.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.911
No, there's someone
else involved in this.

10:41.912 --> 10:43.773
You are not going to
repeat that to anyone,

10:43.774 --> 10:45.014
including the police.

10:45.015 --> 10:46.816
Why?

10:46.817 --> 10:48.818
I don't have time to explain.

10:48.819 --> 10:50.850
Just tell me you're
gonna do it, Ethan.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.922
Please, for me.

10:52.923 --> 10:53.983
Dr. Hunt...

10:53.984 --> 10:55.955
(Tommy) So what do you got?

10:55.956 --> 10:58.988
Looks like she was
killed late last night.

10:58.989 --> 11:00.791
Really?

11:02.062 --> 11:03.793
Yeah.

11:03.794 --> 11:05.064
Uh, her father probably
dumped her here

11:05.065 --> 11:07.036
right before you
caught up with him.

11:07.037 --> 11:08.838
You think it was
Wallace that killed her?

11:08.839 --> 11:10.900
It's a likely scenario.

11:10.901 --> 11:12.141
(Adam) Really?

11:12.142 --> 11:14.073
Because all Wallace's
victims were adult males,

11:14.074 --> 11:15.945
he never shot any of them,

11:15.946 --> 11:17.947
and, uh, why kill
his own daughter?

11:17.948 --> 11:22.051
Well, maybe he realized
that we were zeroing in on him.

11:22.052 --> 11:25.014
But then what do I
know? I'm just an m.E.

11:25.015 --> 11:27.017
I'll leave the deep
thinking to you.

11:28.819 --> 11:31.020
Get her back a.S.A.P.

11:31.021 --> 11:32.962
Talk to you later.

11:32.963 --> 11:34.964
Is she always that emasculating?

11:34.965 --> 11:36.726
Yeah.

11:36.727 --> 11:40.069
She's never actually
lied to me before, though.

11:40.070 --> 11:42.001
Thank you.

11:42.002 --> 11:43.933
You gonna tell me
what's going on?

11:43.934 --> 11:45.735
What's important is finding out

11:45.736 --> 11:47.837
who killed that girl and where.

11:47.838 --> 11:49.178
And you don't think
the best way to do that

11:49.179 --> 11:50.940
is with the help of the
police? Go back with the Van.

11:50.941 --> 11:52.942
Make sure that you
do the external exam.

11:52.943 --> 11:55.084
Run blood for tox, get
scrapings and trace,

11:55.085 --> 11:57.987
and then do a
sexual assault kit, stat.

11:57.988 --> 11:59.749
Wait. Where are you going?

11:59.750 --> 12:00.890
To talk to the only man alive

12:00.891 --> 12:02.893
who might know
who killed that girl.

12:04.755 --> 12:07.026
(Man) Philadelphia police
undertook a daring raid

12:07.027 --> 12:08.828
at the port of
Philadelphia earlier today,

12:08.829 --> 12:11.901
bringing to a close an
intense 48-hour manhunt

12:11.902 --> 12:14.804
for a suspected killer of
five local-area veterans...

12:14.805 --> 12:17.937
Mr. Simmons, I'm Dr. Hunt.

12:17.938 --> 12:20.870
Hunt? You're... you're the one
that saved my life last night?

12:20.871 --> 12:22.741
I-It wasn't just me, and
I'm not here for gratitude.

12:22.742 --> 12:23.913
I'm here for information.

12:23.914 --> 12:25.214
Okay.

12:25.215 --> 12:28.077
It turns out that Dr. Wallace
was not working alone.

12:28.078 --> 12:29.819
There was somebody
else involved,

12:29.820 --> 12:32.021
somebody who was forcing
him to operate on those victims.

12:32.022 --> 12:34.123
I need to find this person.

12:34.124 --> 12:36.025
Another life is at stake.

12:36.026 --> 12:37.756
I'm sorry, ma'am,

12:37.757 --> 12:39.758
but if you're asking
me if I saw anyone,

12:39.759 --> 12:41.030
the answer's no.

12:41.031 --> 12:42.862
Are you sure?

12:42.863 --> 12:44.934
Please try to remember
something, anything.

12:44.935 --> 12:47.036
What about when
you were abducted,

12:47.037 --> 12:48.968
uh, being prepped for surgery?

12:48.969 --> 12:50.239
Last thing I remember,

12:50.240 --> 12:52.071
someone was sticking a
needle in me from behind.

12:52.072 --> 12:54.904
And the next thing,
I-I was waking up here.

12:54.905 --> 12:55.975
Are you sure?

12:55.976 --> 12:58.077
Anything, please.

12:58.078 --> 13:00.880
I'll keep trying, I swear.

13:00.881 --> 13:05.114
A-And if there's anything
else I can do to repay you...

13:05.115 --> 13:07.116
No, just...

13:07.117 --> 13:09.558
Keep this between us, please.

13:09.559 --> 13:10.820
(Cell phone rings)

13:10.821 --> 13:12.823
You have my word.

13:14.024 --> 13:15.124
(Lowered voice) Tell
me you found something.

13:15.125 --> 13:16.826
(Ethan) Haven't found

13:16.827 --> 13:17.897
any foreign d.N.A. Yet,

13:17.898 --> 13:19.068
but there is some
cellulose trace

13:19.069 --> 13:20.970
under Alyssa's fingernail.

13:20.971 --> 13:22.832
Cellulose? It could be anything

13:22.833 --> 13:25.975
derived from plants, fabric,
paper, building materials...

13:25.976 --> 13:27.576
Yeah, I know what it is.

13:27.577 --> 13:28.978
Can the lab narrow it down?

13:28.979 --> 13:30.940
They're doing scanning
electron micrographs.

13:30.941 --> 13:32.111
It's gonna take three hours.

13:32.112 --> 13:33.883
(Sighs) That's too late.

13:33.884 --> 13:35.114
For what?

13:35.115 --> 13:38.888
Just go back to the
body and find something.

13:38.889 --> 13:41.020
Look, if you want me to ask
Kate or Curtis to take a look...

13:41.021 --> 13:44.894
No. I want you to do
it. Just do it. (Beeps)

13:44.895 --> 13:46.025
(Sighs)

13:46.026 --> 13:48.027
(People speaking indistinctly)

13:48.028 --> 13:49.959
(Woman speaking
indistinctly over P.A.)

13:49.960 --> 13:53.032
Tommy, I just... I was just, um,

13:53.033 --> 13:54.833
checking in on Karl Simmons.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.966
He's still... Feeling
the anesthesia

13:56.967 --> 13:59.108
so I wouldn't
interrogate him just yet.

13:59.109 --> 14:02.111
Mm. Actually, I came
here to talk to you.

14:02.112 --> 14:04.974
How'd you know I'd be here?

14:04.975 --> 14:07.076
I followed you.

14:07.077 --> 14:08.918
You followed me?

14:08.919 --> 14:10.980
First you move to Philadelphia,
now you're following...

14:10.981 --> 14:12.982
What, you... That's
what a stalker does.

14:12.983 --> 14:14.083
Megan, you can
go on the offensive

14:14.084 --> 14:15.154
with anybody else...

14:15.155 --> 14:16.625
This is just not gonna work.

14:16.626 --> 14:18.989
I'm here because you lied to me.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.893
Look, I've been a
cop for 20 years.

14:23.894 --> 14:25.094
I could tell that
girl died recently.

14:25.095 --> 14:27.596
There's no way
her father killed her.

14:27.597 --> 14:28.998
What, you're a doctor now?

14:28.999 --> 14:30.869
Time of death is
caused by many factors...

14:30.870 --> 14:32.871
Megan, stop it, all right? Of
which you know nothing about!

14:32.872 --> 14:34.143
Megan, shut up!

14:34.144 --> 14:35.975
I heard you talking
to Karl Simmons.

14:35.976 --> 14:37.576
I heard you on the phone.

14:37.577 --> 14:39.208
You know there's
another killer out there.

14:39.209 --> 14:40.910
Now you gotta tell me the
truth, 'cause though I probably got

14:40.911 --> 14:42.651
more Patience for you than
any other man in the world,

14:42.652 --> 14:45.154
right now I'm running out of it.

14:45.155 --> 14:47.957
(Lowered voice) Do not touch me!

14:47.958 --> 14:49.088
Megan, talk to me.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.061
Don't make me
take this upstairs.

14:55.095 --> 14:57.066
You do that,

14:57.067 --> 14:59.068
they kill my daughter.

14:59.069 --> 15:01.971
What?

15:01.972 --> 15:03.132
(Voice breaking) Can
you just walk away?

15:03.133 --> 15:07.107
Please, for my sake,
just leave it alone.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.580
I can't.

15:18.288 --> 15:19.388
(People speaking indistinctly)

15:19.389 --> 15:22.251
Whoever is behind
this forced Wallace

15:22.252 --> 15:24.253
to implant the bomb
in the the six victims

15:24.254 --> 15:27.126
by kidnapping his daughter,

15:27.127 --> 15:28.497
just like they took Lacey.

15:28.498 --> 15:31.230
Almost no metal.

15:31.231 --> 15:33.332
It's not gonna show
up on a strip search.

15:33.333 --> 15:35.234
You almost gotta assume

15:35.235 --> 15:36.365
this is about getting
through airport security.

15:36.366 --> 15:38.237
They want to blow
up a plane. Yeah.

15:38.238 --> 15:39.308
And if I don't give
it back to them,

15:39.309 --> 15:40.369
they kill my daughter.

15:40.370 --> 15:41.570
If I do...

15:41.571 --> 15:44.173
God knows how many
people they're gonna kill.

15:44.174 --> 15:45.414
What were you going to do?

15:45.415 --> 15:47.246
(Sighs)

15:47.247 --> 15:49.378
I've been trying
to find the killer...

15:49.379 --> 15:52.221
So I don't have to
answer that question.

15:52.222 --> 15:54.383
That's always been your problem.

15:54.384 --> 15:56.255
What is?

15:56.256 --> 15:58.187
Thinking you can do
everything on your own.

15:58.188 --> 15:59.328
I didn't have a choice.

15:59.329 --> 16:00.459
Well, you do now.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.361
I'm not gonna let
whoever's behind this

16:02.362 --> 16:04.163
blow up a planeload of people,

16:04.164 --> 16:05.494
but I'm not gonna
let 'em do anything

16:05.495 --> 16:07.497
to your daughter, either.

16:09.399 --> 16:12.271
How?

16:12.272 --> 16:14.473
No, I should be done about 8:00.

16:14.474 --> 16:18.177
Yeah, so I was thinking,
uh, maybe Sushi,

16:18.178 --> 16:21.280
uh, that club on 11th later.

16:21.281 --> 16:22.581
Yeah, listen... Hey.

16:22.582 --> 16:24.113
Adam's not gonna make it
tonight. Maybe another time.

16:24.114 --> 16:25.384
Yo, this is not a joke...
You think that was funny?

16:25.385 --> 16:27.356
Hello. Hello. Hel...

16:27.357 --> 16:28.617
Do you know who
you just hung up on?

16:28.618 --> 16:30.489
A lingerie model. That's
right, a lingerie model.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.321
(Clicking keypad buttons)
This is her last night in town

16:32.322 --> 16:35.165
before she moves to rio to
teach a class in pole dancing.

16:36.396 --> 16:39.328
I need your help.

16:39.329 --> 16:41.270
Okay.

16:41.271 --> 16:44.404
(Whirring)

17:00.190 --> 17:02.451
(Door closes)

17:02.452 --> 17:04.453
Whoa. What is that?

17:04.454 --> 17:06.195
It's a bomb. Any luck?

17:06.196 --> 17:09.228
There's two different
liquids in separate chambers

17:09.229 --> 17:11.130
which explode when mixed.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.431
I'm betting this
cloudy solution here

17:12.432 --> 17:15.264
contains the
potassium-rich compound

17:15.265 --> 17:17.236
which we found in all of
our victims' blood work.

17:17.237 --> 17:20.139
I'm diluting it out with saline.

17:20.140 --> 17:22.371
It should keep it
from ever detonating.

17:22.372 --> 17:24.373
Uh, wait. You're...
you're serious?

17:24.374 --> 17:26.245
That's actually a bomb?

17:26.246 --> 17:28.447
I need you to put a team
together right away...

17:28.448 --> 17:31.450
Cops we can trust, work
off book, no questions asked.

17:31.451 --> 17:33.252
For what?

17:33.253 --> 17:35.184
We're gonna follow Megan
to a rendezvous where she's

17:35.185 --> 17:37.186
gonna meet the real
killer of those six men.

17:37.187 --> 17:38.387
We can't get too close

17:38.388 --> 17:41.190
or they're going to
kill Megan's daughter.

17:41.191 --> 17:42.261
What?

17:42.262 --> 17:43.432
We can't let 'em
get too far away

17:43.433 --> 17:45.494
'cause they have
plans to blow up a plane.

17:45.495 --> 17:47.166
Uh...

17:47.167 --> 17:48.497
Make the calls.

17:48.498 --> 17:50.299
I'll fill you in on the details
once we're on the move.

17:50.300 --> 17:51.500
Can you trust him?

17:51.501 --> 17:54.273
Well, every idea he
has is a stroke of genius,

17:54.274 --> 17:56.145
he doesn't know when to shut up,

17:56.146 --> 17:57.346
and in general, he's
a huge pain in the ass,

17:57.347 --> 17:59.208
but he's my partner.

17:59.209 --> 18:01.410
You didn't answer the question.

18:01.411 --> 18:04.284
I trust him with my life.

18:09.459 --> 18:12.221
All right. (Exhales deeply)

18:12.222 --> 18:15.264
Now this is our best and only
chance at getting Lacey back

18:15.265 --> 18:16.395
and netting the suspects,

18:16.396 --> 18:18.227
but there's a lot that
could go wrong here

18:18.228 --> 18:20.269
for you and your daughter.

18:20.270 --> 18:21.600
I mean, you're basically...

18:21.601 --> 18:23.372
(Beeping) Risking your life
on the word of a murderer

18:23.373 --> 18:24.433
that they'll give her back.

18:24.434 --> 18:26.275
For all we know,
Lacey could still be...

18:26.276 --> 18:29.239
She's alive, Tommy.
I know she is.

18:48.198 --> 18:49.258
(Radio clicks)

18:49.259 --> 18:52.161
There's no change here. Status?

18:52.162 --> 18:53.362
(Man) Quad one, no change.

18:53.363 --> 18:55.204
(Man) Quad two, nothing here.

18:55.205 --> 18:56.435
(Man) Quad three, same.

18:56.436 --> 18:58.437
(Man) Quad four, same.

18:58.438 --> 19:02.241
All right. Remember it's
critical you stay out of sight.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.373
(Beep)

19:04.374 --> 19:06.175
You know I'm
here for you, right?

19:06.176 --> 19:08.277
Uh-huh.

19:08.278 --> 19:13.151
I just want to make sure you
realize what could happen.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.453
If we lose the suspect,

19:14.454 --> 19:16.455
they blow up a plane,

19:16.456 --> 19:18.457
you and I will face
criminal charges.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.459
Yeah, that sounds about right.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.231
No, my point is,

19:22.232 --> 19:24.364
you're really going out
on a limb for this woman.

19:26.296 --> 19:28.397
So is she or isn't she
why you moved to Philly?

19:28.398 --> 19:31.400
I-I'm thinking maybe
I deserve an answer,

19:31.401 --> 19:35.375
you know, considering
the circumstances.

19:36.476 --> 19:38.508
(Cell phone chimes)

19:44.354 --> 19:45.414
(Tommy) She's moving.

19:45.415 --> 19:46.555
(Adam) All right. (Radio clicks)

19:46.556 --> 19:48.317
It looks like the
suspect made contact.

19:48.318 --> 19:51.420
Dr. Hunt is moving
into the structure.

19:51.421 --> 19:52.492
(Click)

19:55.295 --> 19:57.266
(Tommy) She's
moving out of sight.

19:57.267 --> 19:58.427
No, I got her.

19:58.428 --> 20:00.500
She's in the stairwell.

20:22.552 --> 20:25.395
(Elevator bell dings)

20:38.438 --> 20:41.441
(Ball bounces echo)

20:49.018 --> 20:50.980
(Chimes)

20:57.487 --> 20:58.557
Got her.

20:58.558 --> 21:01.260
All right.

21:04.494 --> 21:06.435
(Tires squeal)

21:06.436 --> 21:08.337
It looks like we're
on. (Radio clicks)

21:08.338 --> 21:09.568
White late-model
Van, tinted windows.

21:09.569 --> 21:11.341
I'm trying to get
a plate. (Click)

21:15.545 --> 21:17.005
Can you see her?

21:17.006 --> 21:19.048
No.

21:23.413 --> 21:25.054
Karl. Dr. Hunt.

21:26.986 --> 21:28.388
(Clicking) Ah!

21:29.519 --> 21:31.391
(Thuds)

21:39.499 --> 21:42.030
(Tires squeal)

21:42.031 --> 21:43.372
Come on.

21:43.373 --> 21:46.005
(Tires squeal)

22:03.623 --> 22:05.695
(Footsteps approach)

22:07.657 --> 22:09.659
Where's Dr. Hunt?

22:10.800 --> 22:13.602
I-I don't... i don't know. Why?

22:13.603 --> 22:14.803
Because she knew I
wanted to be updated

22:14.804 --> 22:16.705
on any developments
in the Wallace case.

22:16.706 --> 22:18.607
So why didn't she or... (Laughs)

22:18.608 --> 22:20.509
For that matter, you... Hmm.

22:20.510 --> 22:22.471
Tell me that the girl
you found this morning

22:22.472 --> 22:24.473
was Wallace's daughter?

22:24.474 --> 22:25.814
Y-You'd, uh, you have to
take that up with Dr. Hunt.

22:25.815 --> 22:27.676
I'm just... I'm closing
her up here, so...

22:27.677 --> 22:28.747
(Curtis) This
doesn't make sense.

22:28.748 --> 22:29.848
The time of death
Dr. Hunt reported

22:29.849 --> 22:31.520
doesn't match any of the labs.

22:31.521 --> 22:33.652
What? No? Really?

22:33.653 --> 22:36.485
Yes, really, and don't tell
me you didn't notice that.

22:36.486 --> 22:37.886
All right, what is going on?

22:37.887 --> 22:39.688
And do not tell me to talk
to Dr. Hunt. I am asking you.

22:39.689 --> 22:41.530
Okay, you're putting me in a
very awkward position here.

22:41.531 --> 22:42.731
Okay? Really? You're
gonna be in a worse position

22:42.732 --> 22:45.594
when I refuse to sign
off on your fellowship.

22:45.595 --> 22:47.696
Answer the question, Ethan.

22:47.697 --> 22:49.498
(Curtis) Now!

22:49.499 --> 22:50.699
Wallace was working
with someone else.

22:50.700 --> 22:52.471
That's who killed the girl.

22:52.472 --> 22:53.942
Dr. Hunt made me
promise not to say anything.

22:53.943 --> 22:55.504
I don't know why. I don't even
know what the hell is going on.

22:55.505 --> 22:56.605
And I'm sorry I ever agreed
to keep my mouth shut.

22:56.606 --> 22:57.676
You know why?
'Cause I'm not good at it.

22:57.677 --> 22:58.907
Wait. (Sighs)

22:58.908 --> 23:01.650
Wait. Why would she do
that? What is she thinking?

23:01.651 --> 23:02.812
She didn't tell me.

23:04.714 --> 23:06.485
We'll discuss your future later.

23:06.486 --> 23:07.686
There is something
we're not seeing here.

23:07.687 --> 23:09.618
Give me everything
you've got on this girl...

23:09.619 --> 23:11.760
Preliminary ballistics, trace, tox,
all of it. (Cell phone keypad beeps)

23:11.761 --> 23:13.492
(Auto dials)

23:13.493 --> 23:15.695
This is Megan hunt.
Leave a message.

23:20.770 --> 23:22.701
(Karl sighs)

23:22.702 --> 23:24.674
(Exhales)

23:34.714 --> 23:36.685
We should probably
fall further back.

23:36.686 --> 23:37.816
They could make us.

23:37.817 --> 23:39.548
(Sighs)

23:39.549 --> 23:41.690
All right.

23:41.691 --> 23:44.654
Widen the lead a quarter mile.

23:52.532 --> 23:53.832
(Sighs)

23:53.833 --> 23:55.764
(Clanks)

23:55.765 --> 23:58.567
(Inhales) Where's my daughter?

23:58.568 --> 24:00.509
Where is she? (Pants)

24:00.510 --> 24:01.640
You'll see her soon.

24:01.641 --> 24:04.613
Yvonne's keeping
her safe and sound.

24:04.614 --> 24:07.746
Yvonne? What... Wallace's nurse?

24:07.747 --> 24:09.778
We met in a v.A. Survivors group

24:09.779 --> 24:11.520
two years ago.

24:11.521 --> 24:12.781
Pretty much taken
us all that time

24:12.782 --> 24:14.623
to put this together.

24:14.624 --> 24:16.625
You forced Wallace

24:16.626 --> 24:19.828
to put the... bomb in those men.

24:19.829 --> 24:22.691
(Sighs) God, it was a test run.

24:22.692 --> 24:24.663
Yeah.

24:24.664 --> 24:27.597
For putting it in me.

24:29.769 --> 24:32.771
If you hadn't saved
me this morning,

24:32.772 --> 24:36.745
I'd have been on a 3:00
flight, nothing left of me by now.

24:36.746 --> 24:39.649
Or anybody else on that plane.

24:40.850 --> 24:44.553
How could you
kill innocent people

24:44.554 --> 24:46.685
after what you've been through?

24:46.686 --> 24:49.558
Ever since we invaded
Iraq and Afghanistan,

24:49.559 --> 24:52.521
6,000 soldiers have
died in combat...

24:52.522 --> 24:55.664
Incredibly tragic, yes.

24:55.665 --> 24:59.868
But over 6,000 veterans
commit suicide each year...

24:59.869 --> 25:01.870
Men that I considered brothers,

25:01.871 --> 25:04.502
people that I loved.

25:04.503 --> 25:05.834
We were willing to give
our lives for this country,

25:05.835 --> 25:07.576
but when we got back, it was,

25:07.577 --> 25:10.639
"the hell with you
and your problems.

25:10.640 --> 25:12.841
Just shut up. Stop
making noise."

25:12.842 --> 25:14.843
Well, I'm gonna make noise.

25:14.844 --> 25:17.786
I'm gonna make a
noise that they can hear...

25:17.787 --> 25:20.789
A lot...

25:20.790 --> 25:22.691
For those lost men.

25:22.692 --> 25:23.892
Yeah?

25:23.893 --> 25:26.895
You just killed six vets.

25:26.896 --> 25:29.297
Shells...

25:29.298 --> 25:30.759
Like me, dead inside.

25:30.760 --> 25:33.301
I did 'em a favor.

25:33.302 --> 25:35.835
Like you did Wallace's daughter?

25:38.638 --> 25:40.869
War is accepting

25:40.870 --> 25:43.812
that change requires
desperate measures.

25:43.813 --> 25:44.913
She was 14.

25:44.914 --> 25:47.576
It's a shame that
Yvonne had to do that,

25:47.577 --> 25:48.777
but once you go to that place,

25:48.778 --> 25:52.551
once you take that first life...

25:53.883 --> 25:56.886
Everything after is rote...

26:01.661 --> 26:04.834
Until it's your own time.

26:10.840 --> 26:12.300
(Beeps and chirps)

26:12.301 --> 26:14.572
All right. They're slowing.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.344
(Beeping)

26:16.345 --> 26:18.778
They're turning
off the main road.

26:20.610 --> 26:23.351
And they're stopping.

26:23.352 --> 26:26.785
They're pulling into a
one-story industrial building.

26:26.786 --> 26:29.587
Okay, pull up everything
you can on that location...

26:29.588 --> 26:31.820
City blueprints,
points of entry,

26:31.821 --> 26:33.692
opportunities for cover.

26:33.693 --> 26:34.853
Start getting the team ready.

26:42.802 --> 26:44.803
(Brakes squeak)

26:44.804 --> 26:45.874
(Jangles keys)

26:45.875 --> 26:48.336
(Turns engine off)

26:48.337 --> 26:49.778
Where is she?

26:49.779 --> 26:50.840
She's here.

26:52.842 --> 26:55.885
(Jet engines roaring)

27:00.720 --> 27:03.852
(Chain clinking)

27:03.853 --> 27:05.724
Lacey! Are you okay?

27:05.725 --> 27:07.856
Mom. I'm all right.

27:07.857 --> 27:09.658
(Squeaks)

27:09.659 --> 27:10.729
Did they hurt you?

27:10.730 --> 27:11.800
No.

27:11.801 --> 27:13.401
She's hyperglycemic.

27:13.402 --> 27:14.863
(Beeps)

27:14.864 --> 27:17.405
I need that Insulin.

27:17.406 --> 27:18.837
How long has this been out?

27:18.838 --> 27:20.869
A f... a few hours maybe.
I don't... i don't know.

27:20.870 --> 27:21.870
It's in the bag.

27:21.871 --> 27:23.872
She's not getting it yet.

27:23.873 --> 27:26.875
I did what you asked.
I brought the bomb.

27:26.876 --> 27:28.817
This was never about
bringing us the device,

27:28.818 --> 27:32.420
which I assume you sabotaged.

27:32.421 --> 27:34.322
We have others.

27:34.323 --> 27:35.423
We need you to pick up

27:35.424 --> 27:36.984
where Dr. Wallace
left off this morning.

27:40.329 --> 27:41.860
You're gonna put one in me.

27:41.861 --> 27:44.663
(Jet engines whir)

27:45.795 --> 27:47.435
No, I'm not.

27:47.436 --> 27:48.767
Well, then I'm sorry.

27:48.768 --> 27:51.800
Your daughter will
die from diabetic shock.

27:51.801 --> 27:53.401
Or sooner.

27:53.402 --> 27:55.804
I'll be honest
with you, Dr. Hunt.

27:55.805 --> 27:57.445
Killing that girl was

27:57.446 --> 27:59.407
the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

27:59.408 --> 28:03.381
But I will do it
again if I have to.

28:03.382 --> 28:07.355
We need an answer now, Dr. Hunt.

28:07.356 --> 28:09.889
Will you perform
the surgery or not?

28:15.424 --> 28:17.897
Yeah, I'll do it.

28:41.420 --> 28:42.921
All right, fellas.

28:42.922 --> 28:44.793
Look, these pictures,
they aren't in real time.

28:44.794 --> 28:46.755
So we're gonna have
to do a quick recon first,

28:46.756 --> 28:48.726
then we're gonna split
up into three entry teams...

28:48.727 --> 28:50.829
Here, here, and here.

28:50.830 --> 28:52.460
Adam and I will take the front.

28:52.461 --> 28:54.432
Any questions?

28:54.433 --> 28:55.503
(Officers speak indistinctly)

28:55.504 --> 28:56.766
Let's go.

28:58.367 --> 29:00.769
Yvonne did some checking.

29:00.770 --> 29:02.470
You were an excellent surgeon

29:02.471 --> 29:04.873
except for that last operation.

29:04.874 --> 29:08.817
But losing this patient isn't
an option for you, Dr. Hunt,

29:08.818 --> 29:11.479
or your daughter.

29:11.480 --> 29:13.481
I'll administer the
propofol. You intubate.

29:13.482 --> 29:17.786
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

29:17.787 --> 29:19.357
Remember,

29:19.358 --> 29:22.360
I was a surgical
nurse for eight years.

29:22.361 --> 29:24.894
I'll know it the second
you do anything off book.

29:28.437 --> 29:31.499
You ready?

29:31.500 --> 29:33.402
Yeah.

29:35.444 --> 29:37.376
(Clicks)

30:02.371 --> 30:04.372
Three, two...

30:04.373 --> 30:05.804
One.

30:07.506 --> 30:09.838
(Man) Philadelphia police!

30:09.839 --> 30:12.511
(Man shouts indistinctly)

30:15.444 --> 30:17.815
(Men shouting indistinctly)

30:17.816 --> 30:19.417
Oh, damn it.

30:19.418 --> 30:22.390
They switched it out.
They got an identical Van.

30:22.391 --> 30:23.821
(Holsters gun)

30:23.822 --> 30:25.925
(Adam) It's clear.

30:27.526 --> 30:29.427
Here's your tracker.

30:29.428 --> 30:30.900
Uh-huh.

30:39.508 --> 30:41.911
Let's go.

31:10.439 --> 31:14.073
(Engines roar)

31:18.347 --> 31:21.310
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

31:35.394 --> 31:38.027
(Exhales)

31:43.302 --> 31:45.173
(Whimpers)

31:45.174 --> 31:48.177
(Breathing heavily)

32:12.331 --> 32:14.232
(Yvonne) All right.

32:14.233 --> 32:16.104
Give him ampoule
of physostigmine.

32:16.105 --> 32:18.266
I want him out
from under quickly.

32:18.267 --> 32:20.138
Do it.

32:20.139 --> 32:21.409
(Beeping continues)

32:21.410 --> 32:24.113
(Instrument clatters)

32:30.019 --> 32:32.320
Step away.

32:32.321 --> 32:35.183
You can stop wondering about
when the police are gonna come.

32:35.184 --> 32:37.085
Karl found the tracker.

32:37.086 --> 32:41.130
A sympathizer led them
on a wild goose chase.

32:45.134 --> 32:46.464
(Adam) I understand.

32:46.465 --> 32:50.038
Can you tell the captain
we're on our way back, please?

32:50.039 --> 32:52.141
Okay, thank you.

32:56.175 --> 32:57.305
Well, the f.A.A. Is
shutting down air traffic

32:57.306 --> 32:59.047
starting with a 100-mile radius

32:59.048 --> 33:00.378
then going wider the
longer time goes by.

33:00.379 --> 33:02.150
You know what? We can
pretty much count on being fired

33:02.151 --> 33:03.211
as soon as we get
back to the precinct.

33:03.212 --> 33:04.282
That's for starters.

33:04.283 --> 33:06.184
I don't care. Oh.

33:06.185 --> 33:08.116
Did they put an all agency out
on Megan? Have any sign of her?

33:08.117 --> 33:10.059
Yeah, they're on
it. So far nothing.

33:11.090 --> 33:13.361
Give me the damn Insulin.

33:13.362 --> 33:15.223
There isn't any.

33:15.224 --> 33:16.294
What?

33:16.295 --> 33:18.226
Karl got rid of
all of your things

33:18.227 --> 33:20.098
in case there was another
tracker hidden in them.

33:20.099 --> 33:22.170
No!

33:22.171 --> 33:25.133
No. (Pants)

33:25.134 --> 33:26.404
(Gasps)

33:26.405 --> 33:29.108
(Yvonne) It's not gonna matter.

33:32.111 --> 33:35.183
Once Karl's gone, I need to
get his statement to the media

33:35.184 --> 33:37.245
and continue getting
our message out there.

33:37.246 --> 33:40.349
I can't do that if the
police know who I am.

33:45.054 --> 33:47.225
Please.

33:47.226 --> 33:49.127
My daughter...

33:49.128 --> 33:50.528
Leave her alone.

33:50.529 --> 33:54.062
She doesn't know anything.
She won't say anything. Please.

33:54.063 --> 33:57.306
Once I know that Karl's
okay, it's what has to happen.

33:59.138 --> 34:00.339
Sorry.

34:10.048 --> 34:11.419
(Cell phone rings
and beeps) Sullivan.

34:11.420 --> 34:13.281
Detective Sullivan,
it's Dr. Murphy.

34:13.282 --> 34:16.084
The police have informed me
that Dr. Hunt has gone missing

34:16.085 --> 34:17.255
and under what circumstances,

34:17.256 --> 34:18.426
but I think that you
may be the best person

34:18.427 --> 34:20.158
to share this information with.

34:20.159 --> 34:21.489
What are you talking about?

34:21.490 --> 34:23.131
Wallace's daughter had
cellulose under her fingernails.

34:23.132 --> 34:24.392
We just got the results
back from our lab

34:24.393 --> 34:26.264
I.d.'ing it as wood dust.

34:26.265 --> 34:28.366
Well, they found her in a park.
Could that be where it's from?

34:28.367 --> 34:30.098
No. It's from teak
and mahogany trees,

34:30.099 --> 34:31.539
which don't grow around here,

34:31.540 --> 34:33.841
and it was ground fine, as if
the wood had been machined.

34:33.842 --> 34:36.104
Looks like she was held
and/or killed someplace where

34:36.105 --> 34:39.177
they either milled or built
things out of imported wood.

34:39.178 --> 34:41.179
All right. Thank you,
doctor. I just hope it helps.

34:41.180 --> 34:42.850
Get on the p.C.I.D.
Set up a database.

34:42.851 --> 34:44.382
Lumberyards, mills, furniture...

34:44.383 --> 34:46.384
You know what? I can narrow
it down way more than that.

34:46.385 --> 34:48.186
I just remembered, one of
the men on the list of veterans,

34:48.187 --> 34:49.357
he worked at a mill.

34:49.358 --> 34:51.189
And it's right near an airport.

34:51.190 --> 34:53.322
Sometimes you are as
good as you think you are.

34:55.264 --> 34:57.326
(Engine revs)

34:59.328 --> 35:02.401
(Tires squealing)

35:18.387 --> 35:20.188
Mom.

35:20.189 --> 35:23.192
It's gonna be okay, sweetie.

35:24.393 --> 35:26.123
(Lowered voice) I need you

35:26.124 --> 35:28.156
to listen very carefully to me.

35:28.157 --> 35:29.298
Okay?

35:41.170 --> 35:42.210
Hey.

35:42.211 --> 35:44.172
You okay?

35:44.173 --> 35:47.445
It hurts like hell, but...

35:47.446 --> 35:49.417
Are we okay on time?

35:49.418 --> 35:50.918
Yeah.

35:50.919 --> 35:52.180
Ow.

35:52.181 --> 35:53.921
Flight's in four hours.

35:53.922 --> 35:55.923
(Exhales)

35:55.924 --> 35:58.326
(Lowered voice)
When I tell you...

35:58.327 --> 36:01.359
You're gonna run out the door.

36:01.360 --> 36:03.861
I want you to get

36:03.862 --> 36:06.234
as far away from here

36:06.235 --> 36:08.165
as possible.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.238
And then you find someplace

36:10.239 --> 36:14.342
and you call 9-1-1. Okay?

36:14.343 --> 36:16.173
What about you?

36:16.174 --> 36:18.276
I'm gonna be right behind you.

36:18.277 --> 36:20.177
But you need to
keep running, okay?

36:20.178 --> 36:21.379
Don't look back.

36:21.380 --> 36:22.450
Mom.

36:22.451 --> 36:25.283
Okay?

36:25.284 --> 36:27.255
Sweetie...

36:27.256 --> 36:30.219
Promise me that, please.

36:35.894 --> 36:37.925
(Exhales)

36:37.926 --> 36:38.966
Here.

36:38.967 --> 36:41.899
See if you can sit up.

36:41.900 --> 36:43.200
Yeah.

36:43.201 --> 36:44.402
(Sighs)

36:44.403 --> 36:46.435
I love you.

36:49.438 --> 36:51.939
Lacey, run!

36:51.940 --> 36:53.210
(Yvonne grunting)

36:53.211 --> 36:54.882
Now! Run!

36:54.883 --> 36:58.887
(Megan and Yvonne
grunting and shouting)

37:06.495 --> 37:09.558
(Both grunting)

37:17.706 --> 37:19.567
Ohh!

37:19.568 --> 37:22.510
(Panting) (Lacey crying) Mom.

37:22.511 --> 37:23.741
(Lacey whimpers)

37:23.742 --> 37:25.543
Lacey, run!

37:25.544 --> 37:27.845
(Crying)

37:27.846 --> 37:30.648
I can't.

37:30.649 --> 37:32.820
(Gunfire)

37:32.821 --> 37:34.783
(Grunts)

37:37.626 --> 37:38.856
Come on.

37:38.857 --> 37:40.788
(Adam) You all right?

37:40.789 --> 37:42.760
Where's Karl? Here.

37:42.761 --> 37:44.492
He's got the bomb in him.

37:44.493 --> 37:45.864
All right. (Pants)

37:53.702 --> 37:55.773
Get out of the car, Karl!

37:55.774 --> 37:58.646
(Grunts)

37:58.647 --> 38:00.608
(Groans)

38:00.609 --> 38:02.810
I wanted people to hear me.

38:02.811 --> 38:04.612
There are better ways.

38:04.613 --> 38:07.485
I can't let you leave here.

38:07.486 --> 38:09.858
How this plays out is up to you.

38:13.562 --> 38:16.495
I know.

38:17.566 --> 38:18.697
(Beeps)

38:38.787 --> 38:41.849
Let's see, we can
watch "the incredibles,"

38:41.850 --> 38:44.552
"toy story," "enchanted."

38:44.553 --> 38:45.823
Mom, I'm a teenager.

38:45.824 --> 38:47.655
How about something a
little more age appropriate?

38:47.656 --> 38:49.627
Oh, "sound of music."

38:49.628 --> 38:51.529
Oh, my god.

38:51.530 --> 38:53.731
All right, fine.

38:53.732 --> 38:55.703
Let's get some rest.

38:55.704 --> 38:57.635
You know, it's okay if
you want to go home.

38:57.636 --> 38:59.537
I'm getting out
of here tomorrow.

38:59.538 --> 39:00.639
No. Staying.

39:04.543 --> 39:06.544
And I think that you
should talk to somebody

39:06.545 --> 39:07.675
about what happened.

39:07.676 --> 39:09.647
You mean a shrink?

39:09.648 --> 39:10.818
Exactly what you refused to do?

39:10.819 --> 39:12.820
Okay, fine. It
wasn't right for me.

39:12.821 --> 39:16.654
However... it can
really help some people

39:16.655 --> 39:19.787
who have been through
something traumatic,

39:19.788 --> 39:22.730
which you have.

39:22.731 --> 39:24.792
And I don't want you to...

39:24.793 --> 39:27.666
Keep all of that stuff inside.

39:30.699 --> 39:32.800
When I start to fall asleep,

39:32.801 --> 39:34.842
like, just when
you start dreaming,

39:34.843 --> 39:37.705
it's like...

39:37.706 --> 39:40.878
I'm back there again...

39:40.879 --> 39:43.712
Like I'm living through it.

39:45.584 --> 39:47.685
But I'm never too scared...

39:47.686 --> 39:51.889
Because in my dream, just
like when it really happened...

39:51.890 --> 39:54.693
I always knew that
you'd come for me.

40:03.772 --> 40:05.674
(Sniffles)

40:10.709 --> 40:13.681
(Woman speaking
indistinctly over P.A.)

40:13.682 --> 40:15.514
One second.

40:22.791 --> 40:25.523
I wanted to check with
you if it was okay to visit.

40:25.524 --> 40:26.724
I don't want her seeing me

40:26.725 --> 40:28.596
to bring everything
back or anything. Mm.

40:28.597 --> 40:30.758
How suspiciously
sensitive of you.

40:30.759 --> 40:31.899
Yeah. Strange, huh?

40:31.900 --> 40:33.631
Mm.

40:33.632 --> 40:35.663
You check in at work yet?

40:35.664 --> 40:37.535
Kate is not happy
that I lied to her,

40:37.536 --> 40:38.906
to say the least,

40:38.907 --> 40:40.738
but she doesn't seem to be
under any pressure to fire me,

40:40.739 --> 40:44.742
which I do not
completely understand.

40:44.743 --> 40:47.615
You have something
to do with that?

40:47.616 --> 40:50.578
Maybe.

40:50.579 --> 40:52.720
Well, I had a little...
talk with the d.A.

40:52.721 --> 40:54.722
I said that we could
go public with the truth...

40:54.723 --> 40:56.754
That he was fooled into thinking
the Wallace case was closed,

40:56.755 --> 40:58.556
that if it wasn't
for you and me,

40:58.557 --> 41:00.888
Karl Simmons could've blown
up a planeload of people...

41:00.889 --> 41:04.792
Or he could just leave us
alone and take full credit himself.

41:04.793 --> 41:08.836
He and Dr. Murphy are holding
a press conference as we speak.

41:08.837 --> 41:10.568
You're an evil genius.

41:10.569 --> 41:12.701
I'll take that as a compliment.

41:14.643 --> 41:17.575
(Man speaks
indistinctly over P.A.)

41:17.576 --> 41:18.707
Tommy.

41:19.848 --> 41:21.779
(Sighs)

41:21.780 --> 41:23.612
Thank you.

41:24.853 --> 41:27.556
If it weren't for you...

41:28.757 --> 41:30.819
(Exhales deeply)

41:34.563 --> 41:35.793
Come on.

41:35.794 --> 41:38.766
(Man speaks indistinctly)

41:38.767 --> 41:40.698
Lace,

41:40.699 --> 41:44.872
I would like to introduce
you to an old friend of mine.

41:44.873 --> 41:46.834
Old friend?

41:46.835 --> 41:49.808
That's right. Tommy.
