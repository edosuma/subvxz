BUT WITH EVERY YEAR

00:16.349 --> 00:18.476
THE OPTIONS

00:18.560 --> 00:21.438
- REALLY? A WOMAN YOUR AGE

00:21.521 --> 00:22.772
- OH, DEAR.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.774
I PUT DOWN MY FAKE AGE,
DIDN'T I?

00:24.858 --> 00:25.775
HABIT.

00:25.859 --> 00:28.236
ADD SEVEN.

00:28.319 --> 00:31.906
THEN ADD THREE
AFTER THAT.

00:31.990 --> 00:34.284
- WE HAVE OUR WORK
CUT OUT FOR US, DON'T WE?

00:34.367 --> 00:36.536
NOT TO WORRY.

00:36.619 --> 00:39.080
WE DON'T LIKE TO BRAG,
BUT <i> MIDLIFE MOMMY</i> MAGAZINE

I'M GONNA SHOW YOU SOME OF
OUR MOST POPULAR DONORS.

HE LOOKS VERY SMART.

00:53.386 --> 00:56.306
- OH. IF YOU WANT EDUCATION,
YOU SHOULD TRY 317.

00:56.389 --> 00:57.932
- OOH.

00:58.016 --> 01:00.518
MAYBE A LITTLE
TOO MUCH EDUCATION.

01:00.602 --> 01:02.979
- YES. EVERYONE SAYS
THEY WANT GENIUSES

01:03.062 --> 01:05.940
UNTIL THEY SEE ONE.

01:06.024 --> 01:07.817
WELL, WE--OH.
HE SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.152
YOU CAN'T HAVE HIM.

01:09.235 --> 01:11.029
- WELL, NOW I WANT HIM.
WHO IS HE?

01:11.112 --> 01:14.824
- ONLY OUR ALL-TIME
MOST POPULAR DONOR, NUMBER 106.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.660
WE'VE RETIRED HIM.
- RETIRED HIM?

01:17.744 --> 01:21.122
- WELL, WE CAN'T HAVE
TOO MANY 106s RUNNING AROUND.

01:21.206 --> 01:23.958
IT'S REALLY TOO BAD, THOUGH.
VERY HIGH SUCCESS RATE.

01:24.042 --> 01:25.168
THOSE LITTLE GUYS
CAN CRACK THROUGH

01:25.251 --> 01:28.338
THE HARDEST,
CRUSTIEST OLD EGGS.

01:28.421 --> 01:30.673
AND HIS OFFSPRING
HAVE DONE PHENOMENALLY.

01:30.757 --> 01:33.009
ONE IS ON <i> AMERICAN IDOL</i>
RIGHT NOW.

01:33.092 --> 01:35.512
- CAN I LOOK?
- WE'D RATHER YOU DIDN'T.

01:35.595 --> 01:38.056
- OH, PLEASE?
I'VE HAD A TOUGH YEAR.

01:38.139 --> 01:39.849
I WAS ENGAGED
TO A HOMELESS MAN.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.518
I ALMOST GOT DEPORTED.

01:41.601 --> 01:44.479
I ACCIDENTALLY SHOT THE SON
I GAVE UP FOR ADOPTION.

01:44.562 --> 01:47.482
I STILL HAVEN'T
TOLD YOU MY REAL AGE.

01:54.906 --> 01:57.659
OH, GOD.

02:01.454 --> 02:03.373
OH, GOD.

02:03.456 --> 02:05.750
- JUST RICK WILL BE FINE.

02:17.262 --> 02:18.555
{\an8}- HOWDY.

02:18.638 --> 02:21.140
{\an8}- OH. IS YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD
WATCH TRAINING

02:21.224 --> 02:23.017
{\an8}ALREADY OVER?
- YES, MA'AM.

02:23.101 --> 02:25.103
{\an8}AND LAKEWOOD'S
A PRETTY SAFE NEIGHBORHOOD.

02:25.186 --> 02:27.605
{\an8}BUT RICK STILL GAVE US
THESE PAMPHLETS TO STUDY.

02:27.689 --> 02:29.566
{\an8}"THE SIGNS OF DRUG ABUSE,
HOW TO TALK TO GANG MEMBERS,

02:29.649 --> 02:32.735
{\an8}ARE THERE PROSTITUTES
IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD?"

02:32.819 --> 02:35.321
{\an8}- OH, THERE'S ONE RIGHT THERE.

02:37.490 --> 02:38.908
{\an8}- SO YOU'RE DONE WITH
YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH?

02:38.992 --> 02:40.577
{\an8}- YEAH. YEAH, AND THE FUNNIEST
THING HAPPENED--

02:40.660 --> 02:42.453
{\an8}- GREAT STORY.
SO...

02:42.537 --> 02:44.539
{\an8}DOES THAT MEAN EVERYONE'S
KNOCKED OFF, INCLUDING RICK?

02:44.622 --> 02:45.874
{\an8}- YEAH. YEAH, HE'S PROBABLY
BACK AT HIS PLACE--

02:45.957 --> 02:47.876
{\an8}- RIGHT. I'M OFF THEN.
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

02:47.959 --> 02:51.546
{\an8}- OUT. I WON'T BE LONG.
UNLESS I AM.

02:51.629 --> 02:53.464
{\an8}- THAT'S WEIRD.

02:53.548 --> 02:56.050
{\an8}JOY'S BEEN DISAPPEARING
A LOT LATELY.

02:56.134 --> 02:58.928
{\an8}- I JUST HAD THE MOST
DEPRESSING NEWS FROM MY AGENT.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.930
{\an8}- WHAT'S WRONG?
- THEY'RE MAKING A MUSICAL

03:01.014 --> 03:02.265
{\an8}OF <i> DRIVING MISS DAISY.</i>

03:02.348 --> 03:04.100
{\an8}- OH, WELL,
THAT'S REGRETTABLE.

03:04.183 --> 03:05.602
{\an8}BUT WHY ARE YOU
SO UPSET?

03:05.685 --> 03:07.395
{\an8}- IT'S GONNA BE AT
THE CLEVELAND PLAYHOUSE.

03:07.478 --> 03:09.147
{\an8}I WANTED TO AUDITION
FOR THE LEAD,

03:09.230 --> 03:11.149
{\an8}BUT THE DIRECTOR
WON'T EVEN MEET WITH ME.

03:11.232 --> 03:12.942
{\an8}- HONEY,
THAT'S A GRANDMOTHER PART.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.486
{\an8}- IN A MUSICAL
THAT MIGHT GO TO BROADWAY.

03:15.570 --> 03:17.488
{\an8}AND BEAUTIFUL ACTRESSES
WILLING TO AGE UP

03:17.572 --> 03:19.449
{\an8}ARE ALWAYS AWARD MAGNETS.

03:19.532 --> 03:20.950
{\an8}- AGE UP?

03:21.034 --> 03:22.577
{\an8}[laughing]

03:22.660 --> 03:25.580
{\an8}- YES. IN FACT,
THE DIRECTOR WON'T SEE ME

03:25.663 --> 03:28.249
{\an8}BECAUSE HE SAID I'D BE
UNCONVINCING AS AN OLD LADY.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.793
{\an8}WHAT AN INSULT!

03:30.877 --> 03:33.421
{\an8}[gruffer, Southern accent]
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO

03:33.504 --> 03:35.840
{\an8}BETTER THAN THAT, HOKE,
OR YOU'LL NEVER WIN

03:35.924 --> 03:41.262
{\an8}THE GREAT GEORGIA
CHAUFFEUR'S RACE.

03:41.346 --> 03:43.139
{\an8}- I-I DON'T REMEMBER
THERE BEING A CHAUFFEUR'S RACE

03:43.222 --> 03:44.974
{\an8}IN <i> DRIVING MISS DAISY.</i>

03:45.058 --> 03:48.102
{\an8}- YEAH, WELL, THEY'VE
TAKEN A FEW LIBERTIES.

03:48.186 --> 03:49.604
{\an8}- IT DOESN'T MATTER,

03:49.687 --> 03:51.814
{\an8}'CAUSE YOUR OLD LADY ACTING
IS TERRIBLE!

03:51.898 --> 03:54.734
{\an8}- OH. I SUPPOSE
YOU COULD DO BETTER.

03:59.697 --> 04:01.324
YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:01.407 --> 04:03.993
I'M GONNA GO
ALL <i> TOOTSIE</i> ON THEIR ASS.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.162
I AM GONNA GO
TO THAT AUDITION IN CHARACTER

04:06.245 --> 04:08.539
AS AN OLD LADY,
AND I'M GONNA GET THAT PART.

04:08.623 --> 04:10.667
- MAYBE ELKA COULD GIVE YOU
SOME POINTERS.

04:10.750 --> 04:13.586
- I DO LOVE TELLING PEOPLE
WHAT THEY'RE DOING WRONG.

04:16.172 --> 04:18.675
- I JUST CAME OVER TO ASK HIM
IF HE'D COME OUT OF RETIREMENT.

04:18.757 --> 04:20.468
BUT ONCE I SAW HIM,
I REALIZED

04:20.551 --> 04:22.011
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
A BABY WITH HIM!

04:22.095 --> 04:24.180
AND I STARTED CRYING.

04:24.263 --> 04:26.516
SO HE PUT HIS ARM AROUND ME
TO COMFORT ME,

04:26.599 --> 04:28.351
AND THAT TURNED INTO
A MASSAGE,

04:28.434 --> 04:31.688
AND THE MASSAGE
FELT SO AMAZING...

04:31.771 --> 04:34.691
I FORGOT ABOUT PROCREATION
AND WENT STRAIGHT TO RECREATION.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.693
AND NOW I CAN'T STOP.

04:36.776 --> 04:39.696
AND I FEEL <i> SO ASHAMED!</i>

04:39.779 --> 04:41.364
IT'S LIKE THERE'S THIS FILTH

04:41.447 --> 04:44.659
THAT JUST CAN'T BE
WASHED OFF ME.

04:44.742 --> 04:47.412
- THAT FILTH
IS THE COCONUT OIL.

04:51.290 --> 04:52.834
- THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.

04:52.917 --> 04:54.377
I HAD TO TELL SOMEONE,

04:54.460 --> 04:55.712
AND YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN KNOW

04:55.795 --> 04:57.839
THIS EVER, EVER HAPPENED.

04:57.922 --> 04:59.716
- HUSH, LITTLE BABY.
DON'T SAY A WORD.

04:59.799 --> 05:02.719
PAPA'S GONNA RUB
YOUR UPPER THIRD.

05:02.802 --> 05:05.388
- RICK, I TOLD YOU
THE WHOLE PAPA THING

05:05.471 --> 05:07.223
CREEPS ME OUT,
SO PLEASE--

05:07.306 --> 05:09.434
OH...OH...

05:09.517 --> 05:11.060
HOW DID YOU GET SO GOOD AT--

05:11.144 --> 05:13.104
- MAKING LOVE?

05:13.187 --> 05:14.897
- I WISH YOU WOULDN'T
USE THAT TERM.

05:14.981 --> 05:16.399
IT SOUNDS CHEESY.

05:16.482 --> 05:20.862
- YES. THE SWEETEST CHEESE
TWO PEOPLE CAN SHARE.

05:20.945 --> 05:24.574
ACTUALLY, MY SWORDSMANSHIP
CAME RATHER LATE IN LIFE,

05:24.657 --> 05:27.577
ALTHOUGH I HAD A VAST
THEORETICAL KNOWLEDGE OF SEX

05:27.660 --> 05:32.081
DUE TO EXTENSIVE READING
AND FILM STUDY.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.875
- HOW COME
WHEN YOU'RE NOT TOUCHING ME,

05:33.958 --> 05:35.960
I FIND YOU SO IRRITATING?

05:36.044 --> 05:38.880
- YOU'RE NO DAY AT THE BEACH
FOR ME EITHER, SWEET CAKES.

05:38.963 --> 05:42.925
I PREFER
DARK ITALIAN WOMEN.

05:43.009 --> 05:45.762
WHO LIVE WITH YOU.

05:45.845 --> 05:47.597
- MELANIE?
- SHE'S THE KIND OF GIRL

05:47.680 --> 05:49.098
YOU COULD INTRODUCE
TO YOUR MOTHER

05:49.182 --> 05:51.142
WITHOUT HAVING HER
YELL AT YOU.

05:51.225 --> 05:53.895
SAY...YOU WOULDN'T MIND
DROPPING A HINT TO HER

05:53.978 --> 05:57.190
ABOUT MY SEXELLENCE...
WOULD YOU?

05:57.273 --> 05:59.776
- YOU LEAVE MELANIE ALONE.

05:59.859 --> 06:01.944
I FEEL BAD ENOUGH
BEING ADDICTED

06:02.028 --> 06:03.946
TO THIS MIXTURE
OF PLEASURE AND SHAME.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.406
I WOULDN'T WISH IT ON HER.

06:05.490 --> 06:08.284
- YES. BUT WOULD YOU
WISH ME...

06:10.536 --> 06:12.413
ON YOU?

06:12.497 --> 06:16.417
- YES. BUT ONLY IF YOU PLEASE
JUST SHUT UP.

06:16.501 --> 06:18.294
- OF COURSE, MILADY.
YOUR WISH IS MY...

06:18.377 --> 06:20.505
- SHUT UP!

06:21.839 --> 06:23.174
- AAH!

06:23.257 --> 06:24.675
- HEY, LISTEN TO THIS.

06:24.759 --> 06:26.928
IT'S FROM THE PAMPHLET
ON DRUG ABUSE.

06:27.011 --> 06:29.514
"THE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE
EVASIVENESS,

06:29.597 --> 06:32.433
PARANOIA, EUPHORIA."

06:32.517 --> 06:34.310
I MEAN, I DON'T WANT
TO JUMP TO ANY CONCLUSIONS,

06:34.393 --> 06:35.645
BUT DOESN'T THAT
DESCRIBE THE WAY

06:35.728 --> 06:36.813
JOY'S BEEN ACTING LATELY?

06:36.896 --> 06:39.857
- YES.
LET'S LOCK HER UP.

06:39.941 --> 06:42.485
- NO. I KNOW JOY.

06:42.568 --> 06:44.028
SHE CAN'T BE ON DRUGS.

06:44.112 --> 06:46.572
- CAN WE STILL LOCK HER UP?

06:46.656 --> 06:48.825
- ["elderly" voice]
TEA, HARD CANDY,

06:48.908 --> 06:50.868
KLEENEX.

07:03.214 --> 07:04.882
- GOOD.

07:04.966 --> 07:06.134
GOOD SPEED.

07:06.217 --> 07:08.553
NOW...FEEL THE LACK
OF BURN.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.518
- [grunts]

07:15.601 --> 07:17.353
THERE. HOW'S THAT?

07:17.436 --> 07:20.690
- TERRIBLE!

07:20.773 --> 07:24.152
YOU USED YOUR STANDING UP GRUNT
FOR SITTING DOWN.

07:24.235 --> 07:25.987
- OH. GOOD NOTE.
OKAY, HOW'S THIS?

07:27.822 --> 07:30.032
UGGGHHH!

07:30.116 --> 07:31.200
- BETTER.
BETTER.

07:32.827 --> 07:34.495
- YOU KNOW, I NEED
TO WORKSHOP THIS CHARACTER.

07:34.579 --> 07:37.165
DO YOU THINK I'M READY
TO TAKE HER OUT INTO PUBLIC?

07:37.248 --> 07:39.167
- POP QUIZ.

07:39.250 --> 07:43.045
HOW MUCH DID A CUP OF COFFEE
COST IN 1947?

07:43.129 --> 07:46.215
- WHAT, YOU MEAN LIKE
A VENTI OR A GRANDE?

07:46.299 --> 07:47.592
- HAVE YOU LEARNED NOTHING?

07:47.675 --> 07:48.885
- OH, OH, OH!
RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

07:48.968 --> 07:52.096
UH...YEAH.

07:52.180 --> 07:54.891
["elderly voice"]
IT COST WHAT IT SHOULD COST,

07:54.974 --> 07:58.060
NOT WHAT PEOPLE ARE CHARGING
OTHER PEOPLE AROUND HERE TODAY.

07:58.144 --> 07:59.228
IT IS A CONSPIRACY.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.606
I SAW IT ON FOX NEWS!

08:03.149 --> 08:05.359
- YOU'RE READY.
- [laughs]

08:06.819 --> 08:08.863
- HELLO, DEAR FRIENDS.

08:08.946 --> 08:11.157
YOU'RE ALL LOOKING
FANTASTIC TONIGHT.

08:12.617 --> 08:13.743
- [quietly]
EUPHORIA.

08:13.826 --> 08:16.579
- I CAN'T HEAR YOU
WHEN YOU WHISPER.

08:16.662 --> 08:18.706
- JOY, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN
ALL DAY?

08:18.789 --> 08:21.083
- OH, YOU KNOW.
HERE, THERE, AROUND.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.793
- EVASIVENESS.

08:22.877 --> 08:24.337
JOY, YOU FEELING OKAY?

08:24.420 --> 08:25.713
- BETTER THAN OKAY.

08:25.796 --> 08:27.256
I CAN'T REMEMBER
THE LAST TIME

08:27.340 --> 08:30.092
I FELT THIS RELAXED
AND TENSION-FREE.

08:30.176 --> 08:33.386
I'M GONNA MAKE LEMONADE
FOR ALL MY FAVORITE PEOPLE.

08:33.471 --> 08:35.306
YOU, SWEET MELANIE,

08:35.389 --> 08:37.265
OLD LADY I HAVEN'T MET YET...

08:39.684 --> 08:40.895
AND ELKA.

08:40.977 --> 08:43.813
YOU ADORABLE
LITTLE BUTTON OF A WOMAN.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.985
- YEP, SHE'S ON DRUGS.

08:53.574 --> 08:55.326
- YOU GOT HERE FAST.

08:55.409 --> 08:56.911
- IT SOUNDED LIKE...
YOU NEEDED ME.

08:56.994 --> 08:58.412
WHAT'S UP?

08:58.496 --> 09:00.748
- WELL...IT'S ABOUT JOY.

09:00.831 --> 09:03.709
I THINK SOMETHING'S
GOTTEN INTO HER.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.257
- SOMETHING, INDEED.

09:11.926 --> 09:14.303
- I JUST--I DON'T WANT HER
TO GET IN TROUBLE.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.430
AND I'M PROBABLY WRONG,
BUT...

09:16.514 --> 09:18.474
I THINK SHE MAY
BE ON SOMETHING.

09:21.185 --> 09:22.979
AND SINCE YOU'RE
THE NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH CAPTAIN,

09:23.062 --> 09:24.563
YOU MIGHT KNOW WHERE
SHE'S GETTING HER STUFF.

09:26.357 --> 09:28.859
- I'VE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA.

09:28.943 --> 09:30.861
- CAN YOU SHOW ME?

09:30.945 --> 09:33.864
- HMM.

09:33.948 --> 09:35.491
AS MUCH AS I'D LIKE TO--

09:35.574 --> 09:37.493
- OH, PLEASE, PLEASE.
I HEARD HER ON THE PHONE.

09:37.576 --> 09:40.121
SHE SAID SHE WANTED IT TONIGHT
AND SHE NEEDED IT BAD.

09:40.204 --> 09:45.001
- SHE'S GOT A POWERFUL MONKEY
ON HER BACK, ALL RIGHT.

09:45.084 --> 09:46.794
- YOU SAID AT THE MEETING
THAT THERE WAS A SPOT

09:46.877 --> 09:48.045
WHERE IT ALL GOES DOWN.

09:48.129 --> 09:50.006
CAN YOU PLEASE TAKE ME THERE?

09:50.089 --> 09:52.675
- OKAY.
I'LL GO GET THE VAN.

09:52.758 --> 09:55.886
I JUST NEED TO, UH, I NEED TO
CANCEL A PREVIOUS ENGAGEMENT.

09:59.932 --> 10:01.809
[phone rings]

10:06.147 --> 10:09.608
LINE'S BUSY.
I'LL...CALL BACK LATER.

10:16.574 --> 10:17.867
- OH, THIS PLACE
IS TOO CROWDED,

10:17.950 --> 10:20.494
TOO NOISY,
AND TOO EXPENSIVE!

10:20.578 --> 10:23.080
$6.00 FOR A BEER.
WELL, I REMEMBER

10:23.164 --> 10:24.874
WHEN YOU COULD GET
A BUCKET OF SUDS FOR 4 BITS,

10:24.957 --> 10:26.876
DAGNABBIT!

10:26.959 --> 10:30.880
- YOU'RE FROM LAKEWOOD,
NOT DEADWOOD.

10:30.963 --> 10:32.715
- GOOD NOTE.

10:32.798 --> 10:35.051
OH, MY GOD.

10:35.134 --> 10:38.929
ROBERT MACTAVISH IS AT THE BAR.
HE'S THE DIRECTOR OF <i> DAISY.</i>

10:39.013 --> 10:40.890
HE'S THE ONE WHO SAID
I COULDN'T PLAY OLD.

10:40.973 --> 10:43.351
WELL...I'LL SHOW HIM.

10:49.607 --> 10:52.068
SCOOT OVER, SONNY.
OR MOVE OVER, SCOOTER.

10:52.151 --> 10:55.154
- SORRY.
PLEASE, SIT DOWN.

10:55.237 --> 10:56.364
- ARRRUUUMM.

10:58.199 --> 11:00.576
WELL, THERE'S NO NEED
TO BE SORRY.

11:00.659 --> 11:02.536
BUT IF YOU WANT
TO MAKE IT UP TO ME,

11:02.620 --> 11:04.580
I AM A BIT PARCHED.

11:04.663 --> 11:06.624
I'M DRIER THAN
A REVIVAL MEETING

11:06.707 --> 11:09.043
DURING PROHIBITION.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.255
- GLADLY.
I'M ROBERT MACTAVISH.

11:13.339 --> 11:14.799
- OH, WELL...

11:14.882 --> 11:17.426
I'M MILLICENT...

11:17.510 --> 11:20.012
OSTROVSKY.

11:20.096 --> 11:22.473
84 YEARS YOUNG.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.948
- I CAN'T SEE ANYONE.

11:39.031 --> 11:41.158
- A GOOD SURVEILLANCE
TAKES TIME.

11:41.242 --> 11:44.870
WE COULD BE IN THIS VAN...
ALL NIGHT.

11:48.749 --> 11:50.668
- CHAMPAGNE.
WHAT'S THAT FOR?

11:50.751 --> 11:52.962
- UH...IT'S PART OF OUR COVER.

11:53.045 --> 11:55.589
IN CASE ANYONE ASKS,
THIS IS A FIRST DATE.

11:55.673 --> 11:58.801
THAT'S WHY I, UH, BROUGHT YOU
THESE LILIES.

11:58.884 --> 12:01.345
YOU MENTIONED ONE TIME
THEY WERE YOUR FAVORITE.

12:01.429 --> 12:03.431
- OH, THAT'S SO SWEET!

12:03.514 --> 12:05.641
AND A LITTLE ODD.

12:05.724 --> 12:07.643
BUT NO CHAMPAGNE.
THANK YOU.

12:07.726 --> 12:09.145
I DON'T WANT TO BE OUT OF IT

12:09.228 --> 12:11.313
IN CASE WE HAVE TO SEPARATE
JOY FROM HER DEALER.

12:11.397 --> 12:14.316
- YOU'LL NEED A CROWBAR.

12:14.400 --> 12:17.153
PERHAPS YOU WOULD
PREFER A LITTLE GRASS.

12:17.236 --> 12:18.487
- WHAT? NO. WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO SHUT DOWN DRUGS

12:18.571 --> 12:20.197
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

12:20.281 --> 12:22.867
- HEY, MELLOW.

12:22.950 --> 12:24.994
I'M ONLY TALKING ABOUT
WHEAT GRASS JUICE.

12:25.077 --> 12:26.662
- THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY
WHEAT GRASS JUICE?

12:26.745 --> 12:28.456
- SAYING GRASS IS QUICKER.

12:28.539 --> 12:30.458
"HEY, YOU WANT A CUP OF GRASS?"
"IS THAT FRESH-SQUEEZED GRASS?"

12:30.541 --> 12:33.335
SEE? QUICKER.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.504
- CAN WE JUST DO OUR STAKEOUT?

12:35.588 --> 12:38.340
- I'M FEELING
SOME NEGATIVE TENSION FROM YOU.

12:38.424 --> 12:41.844
A PROPER SURVEILLANCE DEMANDS
A PEACEFUL, EASY FEELING.

12:41.927 --> 12:44.388
- I'M SORRY, I'M JUST...
I'M WORRIED.

12:44.472 --> 12:47.600
- YEAH. CLOSE YOUR EYES
FOR A MINUTE AND JUST...

12:47.683 --> 12:49.643
LISTEN TO THE MUSIC.

12:49.727 --> 12:51.145
- RICK, WHAT ARE YOU--

12:51.228 --> 12:53.981
OH...WHAT ARE YOU--
- DOING?

12:54.064 --> 12:55.900
RELAXING YOU.

12:55.983 --> 12:57.651
YOU WANT ME TO STOP?

12:57.735 --> 13:00.696
- UM...IN A MINUTE.

13:00.779 --> 13:03.991
OH, WOW, RICK,
THAT FEELS SO GOOD.

13:05.409 --> 13:08.245
- YOU BASTARD!
YOU'RE SLEEPING WITH HER TOO?

13:08.329 --> 13:11.540
- OH, MY GOD!
SHE'S HIGH AS A KITE!

13:11.624 --> 13:15.002
- THIS IS YOUR URGENT
NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH BUSINESS?

13:15.085 --> 13:17.922
AND I BROUGHT YOU A HOAGIE
IN CASE YOU GOT HUNGRY!

13:18.005 --> 13:21.383
- OOH! WHAT KIND?

13:21.467 --> 13:24.345
- WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?
- THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW.

13:24.428 --> 13:26.388
- I WAS JUST TRYING TO KEEP HER
FROM FINDING OUT ABOUT US.

13:26.472 --> 13:27.556
- WITH A BACKRUB?
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.225
YOU TWO ARE AN "US"?

13:29.308 --> 13:31.852
- YOU'VE HAD THE MASSAGE.
CAN YOU BLAME ME?

13:35.147 --> 13:36.232
- I DON'T WANT TO GET
AHEAD OF MYSELF,

13:36.315 --> 13:39.276
BUT I CAN'T HELP THINKING
YOU'D BE A PERFECT MISS DAISY.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.362
- OH, I'M JUST FLATTERED
THAT YOU WOULD ASK

13:41.445 --> 13:44.615
AN UNKNOWN ACTRESS LIKE MYSELF
TO AUDITION.

13:44.698 --> 13:47.034
- BUT EVEN IF THINGS
DON'T WORK OUT WITH THE MUSICAL,

13:47.117 --> 13:50.371
I HOPE WE CAN STILL
BE FRIENDS OR...

13:50.454 --> 13:51.580
MORE THAN FRIENDS?

13:51.664 --> 13:55.417
- I'M SORRY?

13:55.501 --> 13:58.087
- I'M DRAWN TO WOMEN LIKE YOU.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.756
ATTRACTIVE, INTELLIGENT,
WISE.

14:00.839 --> 14:02.424
- OLD?

14:02.508 --> 14:06.428
- MATURE AND FULL OF LIFE
EXPERIENCE. YES.

14:06.512 --> 14:09.765
UNTIL LATER, THEN?

14:09.848 --> 14:12.893
YOUR HAND IS REMARKABLY
SMOOTH AND WRINKLE-FREE.

14:12.977 --> 14:14.228
HELLO!
THERE'S AN AGE SPOT.

14:14.311 --> 14:15.437
- WHAT?
I MEAN...

14:15.521 --> 14:18.440
OH, WELL,
THAT LITTLE THING?

14:18.524 --> 14:20.109
[laughs and snorts]
OH, WELL...

14:20.192 --> 14:22.820
I BEST GET BACK
TO MY LITTLE SISTER.

14:28.325 --> 14:30.744
- OKAY. HE'S COMING BY
THE HOUSE TONIGHT

14:30.828 --> 14:32.496
TO AUDITION ME FOR <i> DAISY.</i>

14:32.580 --> 14:34.456
- CONGRATULATIONS!
- YEAH, BUT I THINK

14:34.540 --> 14:36.292
HE WANTS MORE THAN
AN AUDITION.

14:36.375 --> 14:39.962
- OH!
HE'S A WRINKLE CHASER.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.466
- WHAT--THAT'S A THING?

14:44.550 --> 14:46.302
- OH, THEY'RE
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

14:46.385 --> 14:49.805
THAT'S WHY I HAD TO STOP
MALL WALKING.

14:49.888 --> 14:51.640
- OKAY. NEW PLAN.

14:51.724 --> 14:54.810
I AM GONNA NAIL THIS AUDITION
AND GET THIS PART.

14:54.893 --> 14:57.021
BUT I AM NOT GONNA REVEAL
MY REAL SELF

14:57.104 --> 14:58.480
UNTIL OPENING NIGHT.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.441
IN THE MEANTIME,

15:00.524 --> 15:02.484
I'M JUST GONNA TEASE HIM ALONG
ALL THROUGH REHEARSAL.

15:02.568 --> 15:06.071
SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
TEACH ME THE GRUNT FOR SEXY.

15:06.155 --> 15:08.449
- IT'S THE SAME
AS SITTING DOWN.

15:08.532 --> 15:09.658
UUGGHAAAAHH.

15:09.742 --> 15:12.453
[both laughing]

15:14.705 --> 15:18.208
- AGAIN, I'M SORRY
I THOUGHT YOU WERE ON DRUGS.

15:18.292 --> 15:20.669
- IT'S NOT AS WEIRD AS WHAT
I WAS REALLY ON.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.379
- IS HE REALLY THAT GOOD?

15:22.463 --> 15:25.007
- REMEMBER THOSE GIANT MUFFINS
WE LOVED

15:25.090 --> 15:27.635
UNTIL WE FOUND OUT THEY WERE
LIKE A THOUSAND CALORIES EACH?

15:27.718 --> 15:31.430
HE'S THAT GOOD.
HE'S MUFFIN GOOD.

15:31.513 --> 15:33.390
- NO!

15:33.474 --> 15:35.392
- YES!

15:35.476 --> 15:38.020
- WELL, WE'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO DO FOR EACH OTHER

15:38.103 --> 15:39.647
WHAT WE DID
WITH THE MUFFINS.

15:39.730 --> 15:42.149
- JUST EAT THE TOP?

15:42.232 --> 15:45.027
- I'LL STOP YOU
FROM HAVING ANY MORE

15:45.110 --> 15:47.196
AND YOU'LL STOP ME.
- RIGHT.

15:47.279 --> 15:48.697
WE'VE GOT TO BE STRONG.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.324
- SHALL WE GO IN?

15:50.407 --> 15:52.993
- ACTUALLY, I THINK
I'M GONNA GO FOR A WALK.

15:53.077 --> 15:54.036
I'M FEELING A LITTLE TENSE.
- RIGHT.

15:54.119 --> 15:56.038
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE!

15:56.121 --> 15:57.373
YOU'RE GONNA GO BACK TO HIM,
AREN'T YOU?

15:57.456 --> 15:59.208
- OH! I CAN'T HELP IT!

15:59.291 --> 16:01.710
I WANT MY LOVE MUFFIN.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.921
GET ME INSIDE!

16:08.592 --> 16:10.719
- AND, HOKE, I'M GLAD
I GOT TO SEE YOU WIN

16:10.803 --> 16:14.515
THAT CHAUFFEUR'S RACE
BEFORE I DIED.

16:14.598 --> 16:16.725
AND NOW I MUST PASS.

16:16.809 --> 16:21.271
I HOPE THERE'S INTEGRATION
IN HEAVEN...

16:21.355 --> 16:26.110
SO THAT YOU CAN DRIVE ME
FOR ALL OF ETERNITY.

16:33.617 --> 16:35.869
- OH! THAT WAS WONDERFUL.

16:35.953 --> 16:38.080
TEARS!
COME.

16:38.163 --> 16:40.916
SIT DOWN NEXT TO ME.

16:40.999 --> 16:42.918
- UUGGGHH.

16:43.001 --> 16:44.545
OH, DEAR, I'M SORRY.

16:44.628 --> 16:47.548
WAS MY UNDERWEAR SHOWING
THIS WHOLE TIME?

16:47.631 --> 16:49.883
- YOU ARE DRIVING ME CRAZY,
MISS DAISY!

16:49.967 --> 16:51.927
- OH, YOU NAUGHTY BOY, NOW!

16:52.010 --> 16:53.929
I BET YOU DO THAT
WITH ALL THE GIRLS.

16:54.012 --> 16:56.724
SO WHO ELSE AUDITIONED
ANYWAY?

16:56.807 --> 16:59.101
- OH, MY GOD, EVERY
ONCE-GREAT STAR YOU CAN THINK OF

16:59.184 --> 17:00.686
CAME OUT OF THE WOODWORK.

17:00.769 --> 17:02.438
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
THE SOAP OPERA ACTRESS

17:02.521 --> 17:04.147
VICTORIA CHASE?

17:04.231 --> 17:06.942
- OH. THE ACTRESS
WHO WON THE EMMY?

17:07.025 --> 17:09.319
GORGEOUS, TALENTED.

17:09.403 --> 17:11.613
CARRIED <i> EDGE OF TOMORROW</i>
FOR 27 YEARS.

17:11.696 --> 17:14.575
YES, I BELIEVE
I HAVE HEARD OF HER.

17:14.657 --> 17:17.618
- WELL, EVEN SHE WANTED
TO TRY OUT FOR THIS PART.

17:17.703 --> 17:20.497
- OH! WELL, BLESS MY CORN.
SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN FABULOUS.

17:20.580 --> 17:21.915
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

17:21.999 --> 17:24.084
SHE'S A ONE-NOTE WONDER.

17:25.627 --> 17:27.671
- THE ONLY TIME THAT SHE
WAS A ONE-NOTE WONDER

17:27.755 --> 17:31.967
WAS WHEN SHE WAS
IN THE MOVIE <i> ONE-NOTE WONDER.</i>

17:32.050 --> 17:35.429
- COME ON.
SHE'S A SOAP ACTRESS.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.307
- UUHH!
I WILL HAVE YOU KNOW,

17:38.390 --> 17:40.726
MR. MACTAVISH,
THAT SOAP OPERA ACTRESSES

17:40.809 --> 17:43.854
WORK HARDER THAN ANYBODY ELSE
IN THIS BUSINESS.

17:43.937 --> 17:45.522
WE--

17:45.606 --> 17:47.941
THEY...CREATE CHARACTERS

17:48.025 --> 17:52.738
THAT PEOPLE TAKE INTO THEIR
HEARTS FOR DECADES.

17:52.821 --> 17:54.782
NOW, YOU ARE NOTHING BUT
A THEATRICAL SNOB,

17:54.865 --> 17:57.326
AND I DO NOT CARE
TO BE IN YOUR PLAY.

17:57.409 --> 17:59.870
- BUT YOU WOULD BE
SO PERFECT WITH OUR HOKE.

17:59.953 --> 18:02.289
WHAT AM I GONNA TELL
TITO JACKSON?

18:04.333 --> 18:06.460
- I WANT YOU TO GET
OUT OF MY HOUSE.

18:06.543 --> 18:09.296
I WILL NOT BE YOUR DAISY
OR YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

18:09.379 --> 18:11.340
- BUT...I-I THINK
YOU'RE AMAZING

18:11.423 --> 18:14.384
AND TALENTED,
AND I'M CONFUSED.

18:14.468 --> 18:16.845
WHY WOULD YOU CARE SO MUCH
WHAT I THINK OF VICTORIA CHASE?

18:16.929 --> 18:19.848
- BECAUSE...

18:19.932 --> 18:22.518
I AM VICTORIA CHASE,
YOU IDIOT!

18:29.733 --> 18:31.860
- YOU KNOW, I'VE ALWAYS
BEEN AFRAID OF GETTING OLD.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.070
BUT I DON'T KNOW,

18:33.153 --> 18:36.740
AFTER WALKING A MILE
IN ELKA'S NATURALIZERS,

18:36.824 --> 18:39.576
I FEEL A LITTLE LESS SCARED.

18:39.660 --> 18:42.079
YOU DON'T GIVE A DAMN
WHAT PEOPLE THINK

18:42.162 --> 18:44.039
AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S FREEING.

18:44.122 --> 18:45.874
THERE'S SOMETHING
KIND OF WONDERFUL

18:45.958 --> 18:47.543
ABOUT ACCEPTING
THE AGE YOU ARE

18:47.626 --> 18:49.545
AND NOT FIGHTING IT
ALL THE TIME.

18:49.628 --> 18:51.338
- THAT DOES SOUND NICE.

18:51.421 --> 18:53.215
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT
I SHOULD DO.

18:53.298 --> 18:55.300
I KEEP FEELING THIS PRESSURE
THAT IF I WANT TO GET PREGNANT,

18:55.384 --> 18:57.386
IT HAS TO BE RIGHT AWAY.

18:57.469 --> 19:00.097
BUT THERE'S OTHER WAYS
I CAN HAVE A CHILD IN MY LIFE.

19:00.180 --> 19:02.599
I THINK I'M GONNA
RELAX ABOUT IT...

19:02.683 --> 19:05.269
MAYBE GO BACK TO TRYING
TO FIND THE RIGHT GUY.

19:05.352 --> 19:07.271
- WELL, THERE'S NO RUSH
FOR THAT EITHER,

19:07.354 --> 19:10.607
YOU KNOW, AS LONG AS THOSE
WRINKLE CHASERS ARE AROUND.

19:10.691 --> 19:12.234
- I DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO BE
HAPPY THEY EXIST

19:12.317 --> 19:13.694
OR TOTALLY GROSSED OUT.

19:13.777 --> 19:15.404
- WELL, IF CAN IMAGINE
ANYTHING SEXUALLY,

19:15.487 --> 19:17.239
SOMEBODY'S INTO IT.

19:17.322 --> 19:19.491
WHO CAN REALLY JUDGE?

19:21.159 --> 19:22.744
- I HAD SEX WITH RICK.

19:22.828 --> 19:24.621
- I'LL TELL YOU
WHO CAN JUDGE--I CAN.

19:24.705 --> 19:28.083
ARE YOU INSANE?
HOW COULD THIS EVEN HAPPEN?

19:28.166 --> 19:29.918
- IT'S A VERY HEART-WARMING
STORY.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.920
IT TURNS OUT HE'S
THE NUMBER ONE SPERM DONOR

19:32.004 --> 19:34.464
AT THE FERTILITY CLINIC
I WENT TO.

19:34.548 --> 19:37.092
- HMM. AND HOW DO YOU GET
THAT DISTINCTION?

19:37.175 --> 19:38.260
- SAME WAY YOU GET
TO CARNEGIE HALL--

19:38.343 --> 19:41.430
PRACTICE, PRACTICE,
PRACTICE.

19:43.807 --> 19:44.850
LADIES...

19:44.933 --> 19:47.603
- RICK, WE SAID 300 FEET.

19:47.686 --> 19:50.105
- I'VE ONLY COME OVER
TO INVITE ANY AND ALL OF YOU

19:50.188 --> 19:52.482
TO A HOMEMADE PIZZA DINNER.

19:52.566 --> 19:54.735
I WILL BE KNEADING THE DOUGH
MYSELF...

19:54.818 --> 19:57.988
WITH SLOW,
STEADY PRESSURE.

19:58.071 --> 20:00.324
- OOH.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.952
WE DON'T WANT YOU!

20:04.036 --> 20:06.163
OR YOUR GIFTED HANDS.

20:06.246 --> 20:08.999
- I BELIEVE THE LADY
IS ASKING YOU TO LEAVE.

20:09.082 --> 20:10.626
- YOU SEEM RATHER TENSE.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.628
- YES, WELL,
I'VE HAD A TOUGH DAY.

20:12.711 --> 20:14.004
- PERHAPS I CAN BE
OF ASSISTANCE.
