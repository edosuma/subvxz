00:06.139 --> 00:08.975
Miss Lemon, you have several messages.

00:08.975 --> 00:12.467
Let's see... The company running that
bike tour in South Carolina says "no singles".

00:12.612 --> 00:13.813
Your credit card company called,

00:13.813 --> 00:16.516
they want to make sure you're
the one buying cream soda in bulk.

00:16.516 --> 00:17.851
I sure am.

00:17.851 --> 00:20.887
And your landlord called and said
it's not the toilet, it's you.

00:20.887 --> 00:21.854
That's his opinion.

00:22.589 --> 00:25.358
Oh, and Jean from your high school
reunion committee called.

00:25.358 --> 00:26.655
They want to know if
you're coming this weekend.

00:26.726 --> 00:27.727
No. No way.

00:27.727 --> 00:29.129
Oh, you have to go!

00:29.129 --> 00:31.461
My high school union was so much fun!

00:31.931 --> 00:33.455
Hey, there, Michael!

00:34.000 --> 00:35.168
Oh, my God,

00:35.168 --> 00:36.135
Phil Barror!

00:37.170 --> 00:38.137
Hello, Taniqua.

00:41.141 --> 00:42.472
You gotta go to your reunion.

00:42.675 --> 00:45.303
You can get back at everyone who ever
messed with you.

00:45.812 --> 00:48.872
You said I'd never amount to
anything! Look at me now!

00:49.149 --> 00:50.411
Look at this necklace!

00:51.217 --> 00:53.151
Sir, this is a school for deaf girls.

00:53.453 --> 00:54.821
And I definitely would've
gone to my reunion

00:54.821 --> 00:56.982
but the boat I was educated on sank.

00:57.724 --> 00:59.555
Well, I wouldn't have fun, so I'm not going.

01:02.395 --> 01:05.057
Kathy! Look up here, Kathy!

01:06.266 --> 01:09.803
We shouldn't have to go through this, sir.
You're doing the job of C.E.O.,

01:09.803 --> 01:11.905
it should be you on the
cover of the Quarterly Report.

01:11.905 --> 01:14.841
It will be. If Kathy's
father ever comes out of his coma.

01:14.841 --> 01:17.877
Until then, the board put her in
charge and we need to respect that.

01:17.877 --> 01:20.180
What if something
happened to her? Something bad.

01:20.180 --> 01:22.375
Then we'd have a secret that bound us together!

01:23.316 --> 01:25.079
What is she doing?

01:27.087 --> 01:28.349
I don't know.

01:28.988 --> 01:32.389
Either a weather
event's approaching or...

01:35.995 --> 01:37.758
Get me Jack Donaghy.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:07.060 --> 02:09.762
How come there's no
Puerto Ricans on Star Trek?

02:09.762 --> 02:12.925
They got every race and life-form in the galaxy,

02:13.066 --> 02:14.400
except for Puerto Ricans!

02:14.400 --> 02:15.662
What's up with that?!

02:20.373 --> 02:22.000
What is this, the local?

02:27.580 --> 02:28.945
He woke up.

02:29.582 --> 02:30.640
Geiss woke up!

02:30.717 --> 02:31.684
What?

02:35.788 --> 02:36.789
What's that flavor?

02:36.789 --> 02:38.916
It's Dove age-fighting acne cream.

02:39.592 --> 02:41.150
Geiss is awake!

02:41.427 --> 02:42.655
You're gonna be C.E.O.!

02:42.896 --> 02:47.799
Yes. I was the first person he called.
Well, his French-Canadian mistress, then me.

02:47.867 --> 02:50.301
I'm meeting him in one
hour on the Edison Terrace.

02:50.603 --> 02:53.606
I did it, Lemon. I got the brass ring.

02:53.606 --> 02:56.409
And I couldn't have done it without...

02:56.409 --> 02:57.376
my lucky coin.

02:58.912 --> 03:00.504
I'm happy for you.

03:00.713 --> 03:02.408
You're having your reunion this weekend?

03:03.082 --> 03:05.318
I wish I had a Princeton reunion right now.

03:05.318 --> 03:08.014
Wipe that smug smile off Michelle Obama's face.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.657
Am I the only person around
here that doesn't like reunions?

03:10.657 --> 03:11.958
Don't tell me you're not going to go.

03:11.958 --> 03:13.593
This may come as a surprise to you Jack,

03:13.593 --> 03:15.695
but I was kind of a lonel nerd in high school.

03:15.695 --> 03:18.264
If I remember correctly,
you were also a good deal more...

03:18.264 --> 03:19.799
Uh-huh. It was hell for me.

03:19.799 --> 03:21.000
I just wanted to be left alone,

03:21.000 --> 03:23.332
but I guess every high school
has people like Kelsey Winthrop.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.168
Hey Liz, how's the telescope?

03:30.443 --> 03:33.780
The only people going to this thing
are people like her and her stupid friends.

03:33.780 --> 03:35.582
The cool, pretty crowd.

03:35.582 --> 03:37.345
Well, that's you now, Lemon.

03:37.483 --> 03:38.885
You run a hit TV show,

03:38.885 --> 03:40.587
you have very impressive friends,

03:40.587 --> 03:43.385
you've found a hairstyle that works
for you so long as it's not too humid.

03:43.590 --> 03:45.592
And you're telling me that
you don't have the confidence

03:45.592 --> 03:49.295
to face a bunch of whittling, jugblowing
IHOP monkeys?

03:49.295 --> 03:50.830
Jack, It's a suburb of Philadelphia

03:50.830 --> 03:53.321
Lemon, you will go and
show that Kelsey Winthrop

03:53.433 --> 03:58.438
that the ugly duckling has
turned into a vaguely ethnic swan.

03:58.438 --> 04:00.065
No. I'm not going.

04:00.139 --> 04:02.073
I'll never get
a rental car now anyway.

04:02.542 --> 04:03.876
Well, then take the G.E. jet.

04:03.876 --> 04:05.605
The C.E.O. insists.

04:06.846 --> 04:08.214
There's popcorn on the plane.

04:08.214 --> 04:10.079
I want to go to there.

04:16.822 --> 04:21.192
Mr. Geiss, It is very good
to see you up and about, sir.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.228
Yes!

04:22.428 --> 04:25.131
Jackie-boy!
I think you know why you're here.

04:25.131 --> 04:26.598
Congratulations.

04:27.066 --> 04:30.069
You are the first to know officially

04:30.069 --> 04:32.799
that I'm staying on as C.E.O.

04:33.439 --> 04:34.774
I'm sorry, what did you say?

04:34.774 --> 04:38.344
A beam of energy came and
spoke to me during my coma.

04:38.344 --> 04:39.579
Oh, no, no, no.

04:39.579 --> 04:40.580
I don't know what it was.

04:40.580 --> 04:42.282
It could have been an alien.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.383
Maybe it was God.

04:43.383 --> 04:45.752
Maybe it was an unborn Aztec king.

04:45.752 --> 04:49.119
But it told me my work here
is not yet done.

04:49.188 --> 04:50.623
Oh, it's done. I think it's done!

04:50.623 --> 04:53.893
You're still my choice to take over when I die.

04:53.893 --> 04:56.123
If that ever even happens.

05:05.938 --> 05:08.074
Tray, why are you in your angry chair?

05:08.074 --> 05:10.872
Because Kenneth got a bigger
laugh in the elevator than me today.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.312
And where were you two?

05:12.312 --> 05:15.008
Your job is to protect me from embarrassment!

05:15.181 --> 05:16.449
Grizz had to go to the optometrist.

05:16.449 --> 05:18.318
Making up words won't save you!

05:18.318 --> 05:20.353
Okay, we're gettin in the elevator with Kenneth

05:20.353 --> 05:22.719
and you're going to laugh at my jokes!

05:27.794 --> 05:29.462
Hey, Hey. I'm so glad I found you.

05:29.462 --> 05:30.763
There's been a change of plans

05:30.763 --> 05:32.365
Geiss is staying on as C.E.O.

05:32.365 --> 05:33.433
What?

05:33.433 --> 05:35.128
A beam of energy told him to.

05:35.902 --> 05:36.960
That's fun, right?

05:37.337 --> 05:40.006
And instead of running everything
I'm going back to my old job so...

05:40.006 --> 05:41.140
the Standards Department

05:41.140 --> 05:43.810
is telling me you can only say "cat anus"
twice during the show.

05:43.810 --> 05:44.944
But I'm gonna fight for you!

05:44.944 --> 05:45.945
You can say it three times!

05:45.945 --> 05:47.580
Cat anus, cat anus, cat anus!

05:47.580 --> 05:48.948
Are you okay?

05:48.948 --> 05:50.016
I have to be.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.050
What are my other options?

05:51.050 --> 05:52.176
Cry? Wallow?

05:52.285 --> 05:54.754
If I do that, Geiss and the beam win.

05:54.754 --> 05:56.984
If I control my feelings, I win!

05:58.591 --> 06:00.093
Jeez, Jack, tough year.

06:00.093 --> 06:02.061
First William F. Buckley dies, now this.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.954
Next stop impotence, right?

06:08.267 --> 06:10.436
So since we don't have the jet I guess...

06:10.436 --> 06:12.538
No, no! you're still going to your reunion.
Nothing changes.

06:12.538 --> 06:14.841
I've rented a jet and I'll drop you
off on my way to Miami.

06:14.841 --> 06:16.502
Why are you going to Miami?

06:16.609 --> 06:17.877
Why does anyone go to Miami?

06:17.877 --> 06:20.368
Ass and the burgeoning art scene.

06:20.613 --> 06:21.807
I gotta blow off some steam.

06:22.248 --> 06:24.648
Come on, let's go have some fun.

06:29.322 --> 06:30.755
I'm sorry you're stuck in White Haven.

06:31.357 --> 06:34.258
Boy, it was something landing in
this storm, huh?

06:34.694 --> 06:36.525
Listen, about some of this stuff that I said...

06:37.296 --> 06:39.799
One time I laughed at a
blind guy eating spaghetti!

06:39.799 --> 06:42.602
Sometimes I pee in the
shower if I'm really tired!

06:42.602 --> 06:45.004
I saw my grandparents making love once

06:45.004 --> 06:46.801
and I didn't leave right away!

06:48.441 --> 06:49.533
He didn't give it to me.

06:50.576 --> 06:52.912
All that work, all that sacrifice.
Why did I bother?

06:52.912 --> 06:54.947
I know. But remember,

06:54.947 --> 06:57.283
don't let'em win! "Cat anus"?

06:57.283 --> 06:58.317
I don't know who I am.

06:58.317 --> 06:59.385
Jack!

06:59.385 --> 07:00.553
I don't know where I am.

07:00.553 --> 07:01.621
I know it's not Miami,

07:01.621 --> 07:03.022
but you can blow off steam here.

07:03.022 --> 07:05.525
We have a lovely N.C. Wyeth museum...

07:05.525 --> 07:07.993
Actually, some meth addicts burned
that place down last August.

07:08.194 --> 07:11.831
Oh. well there are excellent
restaurants down on Cabot Street...

07:11.831 --> 07:14.534
Um, the Vietnamese immigrants
took over all of those places.

07:14.534 --> 07:16.803
I wouldn't recommend going
to Little Hanoi after dark

07:16.803 --> 07:18.498
unless you're wearing a khan dong.

07:18.671 --> 07:20.229
Why don't you Just direct me to the bar?

07:20.373 --> 07:22.341
Sorry, sir, no bars here.

07:22.341 --> 07:25.077
We've been a dry county since 1880.

07:25.077 --> 07:27.547
It's the one tradition that remains!

07:27.547 --> 07:30.416
But do you like Methodist
churches full of Vietnamese?

07:30.416 --> 07:31.383
Give me the key.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.313
Hey, elevator, what's this?

07:38.591 --> 07:40.286
It's a ghetto mating call!

07:50.470 --> 07:52.199
Wow, I didn't get the memo!

07:56.175 --> 07:58.336
Jeesh, buy a guy a drink first!

08:00.279 --> 08:02.247
This place is bigger than my apartment!

08:23.369 --> 08:24.495
A Manhattan, please.

08:24.804 --> 08:25.771
Sure, what kind of bourbon?

08:27.106 --> 08:28.300
A white wine spritzer, please.

08:35.047 --> 08:36.571
Kelsey Winthrop

08:38.951 --> 08:40.645
I think Danvers has a bar.

08:40.820 --> 08:43.890
To get there go straight
down Ngo Dinh Diem Boulevard

08:43.890 --> 08:45.983
until you see a sign
that says "Detour".

08:46.459 --> 08:47.790
Ignore that, it's a trap.

08:48.160 --> 08:51.430
And then you want to get on Route Nine
going West about 30 miles.

08:51.430 --> 08:53.057
Does the reunion have a bar?

08:58.304 --> 08:59.405
Kelsey?

08:59.405 --> 09:00.463
It's Liz Lemon.

09:01.974 --> 09:03.075
Oh, my God.

09:03.075 --> 09:04.911
Yeah.
Surprising.

09:04.911 --> 09:06.538
But, cocoon, and then...

09:06.612 --> 09:08.307
Flap, flap, flap. Butterfly.

09:09.115 --> 09:11.777
Wow! I did not think you'd come.

09:12.018 --> 09:12.985
Well, I almost didn't.

09:13.252 --> 09:16.589
I was in Manhattan, working in the fast lane.

09:16.589 --> 09:19.888
You made life a living hell for everyone here.

09:20.192 --> 09:21.527
You would have to come to the reunion

09:21.527 --> 09:22.962
and make us go through it all again!

09:22.962 --> 09:23.996
What?

09:23.996 --> 09:26.965
I tried to befriend you
just so you'd leave me alone!

09:27.400 --> 09:29.535
Hey, Liz, how's the telescope?

09:29.535 --> 09:31.765
I don't know, Kelsey.
How's your mother's pill addiction?

09:33.606 --> 09:34.707
What are you talking about?

09:34.707 --> 09:35.674
I was a nerd!

09:36.042 --> 09:37.276
You were a bully!

09:37.276 --> 09:39.107
We were all afraid of you!

09:39.312 --> 09:40.947
We called you the White Haven witch!

09:40.947 --> 09:42.048
Lemon!

09:42.048 --> 09:45.142
Erin, no! Don't sink to her level!

09:45.318 --> 09:47.218
This is a beauty mark!

09:47.687 --> 09:50.089
But you thought it was funny
to say that God pooped on me.

09:50.089 --> 09:51.924
I didn't think anyone was listening to me.

09:51.924 --> 09:53.559
I was a nobody!

09:53.559 --> 09:55.061
You were the homecoming queen!

09:55.061 --> 09:58.030
I have had years of therapy...

09:58.197 --> 09:59.892
Oh no, Kels, your facial tic.

10:01.567 --> 10:03.797
You brought it back! Are you happy?!

10:04.971 --> 10:06.632
And I've still got the mulch business.

10:07.273 --> 10:08.934
It's hard work but I'm outside all day

10:09.141 --> 10:10.802
and I don't answer to anyone.

10:13.079 --> 10:15.348
Excuse me, can I ask you a question?

10:15.348 --> 10:16.515
Sure.

10:16.515 --> 10:17.583
Are you happy?

10:17.583 --> 10:20.186
Well, I got a boat, good friends, a trampoline.

10:20.186 --> 10:21.287
You tell me.

10:21.287 --> 10:22.311
That's the life, right?

10:23.589 --> 10:24.783
What are you doing here?

10:24.991 --> 10:27.593
I'm getting drunk.
Lemon, would you buy my mulch?

10:27.593 --> 10:28.628
I don't know, Jack.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.153
I just found out that I was a jerk in high school.

10:31.631 --> 10:34.794
Turns out I'm not the lovable nerd,
I was the bully you hate.

10:35.635 --> 10:36.795
This is mostly spit!

10:39.138 --> 10:41.907
Hello, Elizabeth. It's Rob Sussman.

10:41.907 --> 10:44.876
Still think I'm "gayer than the
volleyball scene in Top Gun"?

10:44.944 --> 10:46.479
What? No, we were friends!

10:46.479 --> 10:48.381
I only said that stuff to try to make it

10:48.381 --> 10:49.949
okay for you to come out.

10:49.949 --> 10:50.916
Come out of what?

10:51.484 --> 10:53.319
I'd like you to meet my wife

10:53.319 --> 10:56.689
with whom I've raised
three beautiful dogs.

10:56.689 --> 10:57.823
Oh, boy.

10:57.823 --> 10:59.291
I cannot deal right now.

10:59.291 --> 11:01.088
I am so mad all I can do is dance!

11:04.563 --> 11:06.565
Even Rob Sussman hated me?!

11:06.565 --> 11:08.692
He was the first gay guy I ever kissed!

11:09.101 --> 11:10.693
What's wrong with these people?

11:10.836 --> 11:12.303
Nothing, they're good Americans.

11:12.405 --> 11:14.607
Hey, Lemon. Check this out. I just made it up.

11:14.607 --> 11:15.741
The Three B's...

11:15.741 --> 11:17.576
Beer, boats and buds.

11:17.576 --> 11:19.066
Doesn't that sound great?

11:19.779 --> 11:20.846
Are you having a stroke?

11:20.846 --> 11:24.873
No, no. All my life I thought I
made good choices. But am I happy?

11:24.950 --> 11:26.383
These people are happy.

11:26.786 --> 11:27.753
I envy them.

11:28.120 --> 11:29.553
I wish I was one of them.

11:30.856 --> 11:32.258
Larry?

11:32.258 --> 11:33.959
Larry Braverman?

11:33.959 --> 11:35.449
Yes.

11:36.162 --> 11:37.686
I am Larry Braverman.

11:42.101 --> 11:43.625
Larry Braverman.

11:44.303 --> 11:47.106
No one has seen you since graduation.

11:47.106 --> 11:49.942
You're still like the coolest guy ever!

11:49.942 --> 11:51.239
You still have your old Camaro?

11:51.410 --> 11:52.411
No, no.

11:52.411 --> 11:53.571
It finally broke down.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.439
Yeah, from having too much sex in it.

11:56.515 --> 11:57.607
You rock!

11:59.618 --> 12:02.888
Hey, let's go out in the
parking lot and do donuts.

12:02.888 --> 12:03.980
Just like the old days!

12:08.094 --> 12:09.328
Let's do some donuts.

12:09.328 --> 12:10.362
How is this working?

12:10.362 --> 12:12.398
You were 12 years
older than everybody here.

12:12.398 --> 12:15.468
Lemon, rich 50 is
middle class 38, okay?

12:15.468 --> 12:16.602
Jack.

12:16.602 --> 12:17.803
No. I don't want to be Jack Donaghy anymore.

12:17.803 --> 12:20.573
I'm Larry now. That's one thing
that Don Geiss can't take away from me.

12:20.573 --> 12:21.841
Now, are you gonna be leaving soon?

12:21.841 --> 12:23.876
Cause you're kind of harshing
everyone's buzz around here.

12:23.876 --> 12:25.177
No. I'm not gonna leave.

12:25.177 --> 12:28.013
Sure, I said some dumb things
in high school, but I've changed.

12:28.013 --> 12:29.849
I'm gonna turn this thing around, Jack.

12:29.849 --> 12:32.841
Show everybody the good,
kind person I've become!

12:32.952 --> 12:34.286
Go home, Lemon!

12:34.286 --> 12:35.753
No way, new friend!

12:38.991 --> 12:41.494
Jenna, we're the most
important people here, right?

12:41.494 --> 12:43.596
Of course, Tracy. We're actors.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.359
If we didn't exist, how
would people know who to vote for?

12:45.598 --> 12:48.601
And people around here shouldn't take
attention away from us, should they?

12:48.601 --> 12:51.437
No, never! Attention is what gives us power.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.564
If someone threatens that,
you need to put a stop to it.

12:53.873 --> 12:57.009
Who are you worried about?
Is it Allison from Wardrobe's baby?

12:57.009 --> 12:58.811
What is up with that thing?

12:58.811 --> 13:01.041
So she can put her feet in her mouth. So can I.

13:01.814 --> 13:04.083
It's not the baby. It's Kenneth.

13:04.083 --> 13:07.253
Kenneth? Are you crazy?

13:07.253 --> 13:09.255
Come on, he knows his place.

13:09.255 --> 13:10.688
And he worships us.

13:11.390 --> 13:12.414
Yeah, he does...

13:12.625 --> 13:15.253
Come on, you know we're
the big dogs around here.

13:15.561 --> 13:17.654
Hey, let's go throw a
tantrum about the air conditioning.

13:19.665 --> 13:21.292
That sounds really nice.

13:27.406 --> 13:28.373
Larry?

13:29.074 --> 13:31.804
Larry? It's me, Jessica.

13:32.111 --> 13:33.840
I can't believe you're here.

13:34.980 --> 13:36.215
You never answered my letters.

13:36.215 --> 13:38.149
I didn't know what to say.

13:38.884 --> 13:42.922
Because of... you know. The things.

13:42.922 --> 13:44.617
I hate the way we ended, Larry.

13:44.857 --> 13:47.087
I'm so, so sorry for what happened.

13:47.459 --> 13:48.861
I forgive you.

13:48.861 --> 13:50.556
Jessica.

13:51.363 --> 13:53.465
Really? Even for...

13:53.465 --> 13:55.433
Especially for that.

13:56.936 --> 13:59.029
Say what you said to me that night at the lake.

14:02.741 --> 14:03.765
No.

14:12.117 --> 14:17.056
Guys, I just want to say I am so,
so sorry if I ever --

14:17.056 --> 14:18.257
Really, Liz?!

14:18.257 --> 14:20.350
Twenty years too late and way too little.

14:21.327 --> 14:24.430
Why don't you please leave us alone.
We're trying to have fun tonight.

14:24.430 --> 14:26.599
That's my point. I've changed.

14:26.599 --> 14:27.861
New Liz is fun!

14:28.400 --> 14:30.766
I don't ruin parties, I get them going!

14:31.136 --> 14:32.296
Look! Let's all do The Diane!

14:39.612 --> 14:41.136
What is wrong with you?

14:42.181 --> 14:43.148
Diane?

14:49.588 --> 14:50.555
Hi.

14:52.191 --> 14:53.556
Could you hit four, please?

14:55.728 --> 14:57.320
Next stop, Kansas City!

15:01.300 --> 15:05.498
You are so funny.
They should put you on the show!

15:08.841 --> 15:14.580
# Did you ever know that you're my hero,?

15:14.580 --> 15:19.677
# and everything I would like to be?

15:19.752 --> 15:21.086
Singing in the elevator!

15:21.086 --> 15:23.213
It's like a road-trip to the sky!

15:23.389 --> 15:25.257
# 99 bottles of beer on the wall?

15:25.257 --> 15:26.825
# 99 bottles of beer?

15:26.825 --> 15:28.827
# You take one down and pass it around?

15:28.827 --> 15:30.462
# 98 bottles of beer?

15:32.598 --> 15:34.166
Kenneth is a monster!

15:34.166 --> 15:35.861
We have to stop him!

15:39.838 --> 15:42.641
I want you all to know how happy I am right now.

15:42.641 --> 15:46.245
Being here with you people has
helped me more than you can know.

15:46.245 --> 15:47.212
To us!

15:47.980 --> 15:50.949
Look at us! Just like we're back in high school!

15:51.951 --> 15:53.816
You know what was always my favorite thing?

15:53.986 --> 15:55.385
Seven Minutes in Heaven.

15:56.655 --> 15:58.418
You always got the bottle to land on me.

15:58.791 --> 15:59.992
Think you still got the touch?

15:59.992 --> 16:01.084
Oh, yeah.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.028
What are we all doing?

16:09.601 --> 16:10.932
Boo!

16:14.907 --> 16:17.637
Just to be clear, we're not making out.
That would be social suicide.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.678
Ugh. Like I even want to be here.

16:19.678 --> 16:21.180
In this closet, at this reunion.

16:21.180 --> 16:22.348
It's a nightmare!

16:22.348 --> 16:23.816
A nightmare for whom, Lemon?

16:23.816 --> 16:26.652
If these jagweeds don't want
to get to know the nice, new me

16:26.652 --> 16:29.177
then screw them and their
rapidly yellowing teeth.

16:29.288 --> 16:31.323
Wow, Lemon, you really
haven't changed have you?

16:31.323 --> 16:32.324
Excuse me?

16:32.324 --> 16:35.194
What happened when I told you Geiss
had screwed me over for the C.E.O. job?

16:35.194 --> 16:38.263
Did you offer your help as a friend or did
you make some joke about my being impotent?

16:38.263 --> 16:40.933
Jeez, that was like eight hours ago! I was just,

16:40.933 --> 16:42.401
I don't know, cutting the tension.

16:42.401 --> 16:46.531
Or, as always, were you hiding behind your
sense of humor instead of engaging in a real way?

16:46.839 --> 16:49.708
Really? I'm the one who's hiding?
Larry Braverman?

16:49.708 --> 16:50.675
There it is, right there.

16:50.943 --> 16:52.311
When you feel threatened, you attack.

16:52.311 --> 16:54.142
That's why you're almost 40 and still alone!

16:54.213 --> 16:55.647
At least I'm not 50, alone,

16:55.647 --> 16:59.174
and sitting on 2,000 business
cards for a job I'm never going to get!

16:59.385 --> 17:00.853
What did you say?

17:00.853 --> 17:03.122
Your bags were delivered to my room by accident.

17:03.122 --> 17:04.281
Look what I found.

17:04.623 --> 17:06.258
You went to a printer, didn't you?

17:06.258 --> 17:07.925
You picked out a font.

17:07.925 --> 17:09.826
You paid extra for a rush order.

17:10.229 --> 17:12.094
It was your happy, little secret.

17:14.098 --> 17:15.566
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing?

17:16.868 --> 17:18.530
Why is she so mean?

17:21.040 --> 17:22.074
What did you do to Braverman?!

17:22.074 --> 17:23.108
She's awful!

17:23.108 --> 17:24.200
She's the gay one!

17:26.578 --> 17:28.079
Here's your lunch order, Mr. Parcell.

17:28.079 --> 17:29.381
Just the way you like it.

17:29.381 --> 17:31.747
Ham Sandwich with the works. Hold the bread.

17:31.950 --> 17:33.185
But that's my job...

17:33.185 --> 17:36.989
This studio hosted The Kraft
Television Theatre in the 1 950s,

17:36.989 --> 17:41.892
where young writers like Paddy Chayefsky
and Rod Serling first rose to prominence.

17:42.027 --> 17:44.029
Mr. Jordan, why are you giving a tour?

17:44.029 --> 17:46.598
It doesn't feel good when
someone does your job, does it?

17:46.598 --> 17:47.733
I don't understand...

17:47.733 --> 17:51.036
I don't like it when you make
jokes in the elevator. That's my job!

17:51.036 --> 17:53.027
Oh, Lord, I didn't know!

17:53.439 --> 17:56.575
I would never do anything to hurt you!
You're my best friend!

17:56.575 --> 17:59.544
We're not really best
friends we are just good friends!

18:00.079 --> 18:01.747
I just want you to stop.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.908
I will! I will!

18:05.851 --> 18:07.052
I'm so sorry, Miss Maroney.

18:07.052 --> 18:08.420
No, keep crying.

18:08.420 --> 18:11.116
I want you to feel this so you
never make this mistake again.

18:15.194 --> 18:19.528
And for traveling the
farthest distance, David Messinger!

18:21.700 --> 18:25.136
Hey Larry, we've got a plan to get
back at Liz and want to know if you're in.

18:25.437 --> 18:26.805
We're gonna "Carrie" her.

18:26.805 --> 18:27.840
Like the movie.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.569
It will be delicious!

18:30.309 --> 18:34.313
And now... for Best School Spirit, it's Liz Lemon!

18:34.313 --> 18:35.644
Come up on stage, Liz!

18:36.815 --> 18:39.051
No, thanks. I don't want it.

18:39.051 --> 18:42.316
It comes with a $50 gift
certificate to Outback Steak House.

18:42.421 --> 18:43.683
I want to go to there.

19:04.576 --> 19:05.975
Wait!

19:07.513 --> 19:12.918
Wait, wait! We cannot do this.
We cannot "Carrie" Liz Lemon.

19:12.918 --> 19:14.720
Aw, not okay, guys!

19:14.720 --> 19:18.056
We all know that Liz Lemon has her faults.
But no one's perfect.

19:18.056 --> 19:20.786
I mean, I'm certainly not perfect.

19:21.193 --> 19:23.328
Don't say that, Larry!
You're more than perfect!

19:23.328 --> 19:26.565
No, it's true. I've made mistakes.

19:26.565 --> 19:29.398
Sacrificed happiness for a job I
don't think I'm ever going to get.

19:29.935 --> 19:33.336
We all have our ways of coping.
I use sex and awesomeness.

19:36.141 --> 19:37.843
Lemon here hides behind her insults.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.778
But that's not who she is.

19:39.778 --> 19:40.745
She's a good person

19:41.813 --> 19:43.940
whom I'm honored to call my friend.

19:51.256 --> 19:52.382
Thank you, Larry.

19:52.925 --> 19:56.520
And I'm sorry I lashed out at you.
You will need those cards someday.

19:57.596 --> 19:59.621
Larry, we're also happy to
have you back in our lives.

20:00.566 --> 20:01.726
But me especially.

20:01.967 --> 20:03.628
Because there's someone I want you to meet.

20:04.336 --> 20:05.428
Larry...

20:07.439 --> 20:08.497
this is your son.

20:08.740 --> 20:09.908
I am not Larry Braverman.

20:09.908 --> 20:11.577
I repeat, I am not Larry Braverman.

20:11.577 --> 20:14.646
I am Liz Lemon's platonic friend Jack Donaghy.

20:14.646 --> 20:15.781
Lemon, come on, let's go.

20:18.984 --> 20:20.953
Once and for all, I want to say I'm sorry.

20:24.556 --> 20:27.392
You know what? Suck it,
you whittling IHOP monkeys!

20:27.392 --> 20:28.393
Lemon, the jet is waiting!

20:28.393 --> 20:31.296
That's right. A Jet to New York City!

20:31.296 --> 20:32.388
Lemon out!

20:34.199 --> 20:35.393
Braverman!
