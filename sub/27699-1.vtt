00:36.161 --> 00:38.595
Jared.

00:38.597 --> 00:40.599
Why are you upset, honey?

00:40.601 --> 00:42.133
I want my jersey.

00:42.135 --> 00:45.071
- Well, it's because it's dirty.
- I want it.

00:49.243 --> 00:52.578
You know, today is
your first day of school.

00:52.580 --> 00:55.748
What?

00:55.750 --> 00:58.084
You like to play
something in particular?

00:58.086 --> 01:01.521
- Uh, soccer!
- You like to play soccer. And?

01:01.523 --> 01:03.524
And basketball!

01:03.526 --> 01:05.760
What's your favorite color?

01:05.762 --> 01:07.762
Uh...

01:07.764 --> 01:09.764
Uh, blue and yellow.

01:09.766 --> 01:11.499
- Blue...
- And yellow.

01:11.501 --> 01:13.868
- and... yellow.
- Yellow.

01:13.870 --> 01:16.605
What would you like to be
when you grow up?

01:16.607 --> 01:18.607
Motorcycle driver!

01:24.616 --> 01:26.683
Bye! Hi!

01:34.194 --> 01:36.360
Jared?

01:36.362 --> 01:39.299
You should come down
for breakfast.

01:48.008 --> 01:51.345
<i>I wish none of this
had ever happened.</i>

01:53.416 --> 01:56.819
<i>But sometimes
I thank God that it did.</i>

03:07.098 --> 03:09.098
<i>Just repeat after me.</i>

03:09.100 --> 03:10.633
<i>Let your light shine.</i>

03:10.635 --> 03:12.168
Let your light shine.

03:12.170 --> 03:14.939
Now, let me see a show of hands
of those of you

03:14.941 --> 03:16.841
in this room who are imperfect.

03:16.843 --> 03:19.276
Everybody.

03:19.278 --> 03:21.980
That's right.
And a show of hands

03:21.982 --> 03:24.916
for everybody in this room
who is perfect.

03:24.918 --> 03:27.954
- Nobody.
- Amen.

03:27.956 --> 03:29.522
I am blessed

03:29.524 --> 03:33.426
with a beautiful
and deeply soulful wife,

03:33.428 --> 03:37.465
and with a fine...
upstanding...

03:38.667 --> 03:40.668
...and honest son.

03:40.670 --> 03:42.971
I'm a lucky man,

03:42.973 --> 03:46.175
and I'm grateful
for those blessings.

03:57.288 --> 04:00.857
Please don't do that.
You know that makes me nervous.

04:00.859 --> 04:02.525
What if a truck comes along

04:02.527 --> 04:04.729
- and hits your arm?
- It's never gonna happen.

04:04.731 --> 04:06.797
It's happened before.

04:06.799 --> 04:09.167
It has. It has.

04:39.670 --> 04:42.370
Morning.
Welcome to Love in Action.

04:42.372 --> 04:44.272
Hi.

04:44.274 --> 04:48.711
- Name?
- Uh, Nancy Eamons.

04:48.713 --> 04:50.846
Oh, um... the boy, I mean.

04:50.848 --> 04:53.050
- Unless you're the one checking in.
- Oh.

04:53.052 --> 04:55.252
- Jared Eamons.
- Jared Eamons.

04:55.254 --> 04:57.189
Jared. Got you right here.

05:03.362 --> 05:05.596
Great.

05:05.598 --> 05:07.532
Do you want to say
your good-byes?

05:07.534 --> 05:09.601
- Can I see the place?
- I'm afraid you won't be allowed

05:09.603 --> 05:11.603
- beyond the reception area, Mrs. Eamons.
- Oh.

05:11.605 --> 05:15.376
- But you can pick him up at 5:00 p.m.
- Okay.

05:17.045 --> 05:19.548
- It's okay, Mom.
- Mm.

05:22.818 --> 05:24.617
Well, call me anytime.

05:24.619 --> 05:27.054
I'll be at the hotel
on my cell phone.

05:27.056 --> 05:28.957
Uh, we will be holding
his cell phone.

05:28.959 --> 05:31.893
If there are any emergencies,
we will contact you,

05:31.895 --> 05:34.263
but otherwise, 5:00 p.m.

05:36.934 --> 05:38.736
Mm.

05:40.472 --> 05:42.774
You'll do great.

05:44.944 --> 05:46.644
Love you.

05:48.413 --> 05:50.582
<i>Newbie. Eamons.</i>

05:52.619 --> 05:54.420
Empty your pockets.

06:03.330 --> 06:04.597
Do you have
any numbers or photos

06:04.599 --> 06:06.967
we should be concerned about?

06:06.969 --> 06:10.336
We'll check it daily
and call any number at random,

06:10.338 --> 06:12.672
so you best be straight
with us on that.

06:12.674 --> 06:14.674
There's nothing. And, yeah,
call whatever numbers,

06:14.676 --> 06:15.779
if you need to.

06:17.781 --> 06:19.279
"Sobriety...

06:19.281 --> 06:21.616
no smoking,
no alcohol or drugs."

06:21.618 --> 06:24.318
"Off hours...
all clients to remain

06:24.320 --> 06:26.854
within a safe zone area
as designated."

06:26.856 --> 06:30.526
"Attire...
women's skirts must extend

06:30.528 --> 06:32.996
below the knee, and bras are
to be worn at all times."

06:32.998 --> 06:34.030
<i>What's that?</i>

06:34.032 --> 06:36.833
Oh, it-it's, um, I...

06:36.835 --> 06:39.537
I write, I write stories.
Uh, I'm studying it at college.

06:39.539 --> 06:42.206
No journaling.
We're gonna have to read that.

06:42.208 --> 06:43.474
<i>"Confidentiality...</i>

06:43.476 --> 06:45.910
"all m-matters
discussed in therapy

06:45.912 --> 06:47.511
are to remain private."

06:47.513 --> 06:50.982
"Restrooms... members
must be supervised by staff

06:50.984 --> 06:52.584
during restroom visits."

06:52.586 --> 06:55.156
<i>- Your handbook.
- Oh. Yeah.</i>

06:56.490 --> 06:59.058
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

06:59.060 --> 07:01.260
<i>"No viewing
of pornographic material,</i>

07:01.262 --> 07:04.865
"no masturbation,
no physical contact

07:04.867 --> 07:06.233
"with any member at any time

07:06.235 --> 07:09.172
apart from the briefest
of handshakes."

07:38.071 --> 07:40.272
Michael for Aaron.

07:40.274 --> 07:42.607
How many clients
are we expecting today?

07:42.609 --> 07:44.475
Copy, Michael. Hold, please.

07:44.477 --> 07:47.112
Uh, just one second, Jared.

07:47.114 --> 07:49.315
We should have 11 today.

07:49.317 --> 07:51.216
Well, we have
more in the lobby.

07:51.218 --> 07:53.386
It's okay. We should
have another five minutes.

07:53.388 --> 07:54.420
- All right.
- Copy.

07:54.422 --> 07:56.056
Jared, if you just want to go

07:56.058 --> 07:58.259
find yourself a seat and, uh,
make yourself comfortable.

07:58.261 --> 08:00.261
We'll get started soon.

08:05.802 --> 08:07.804
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:15.480 --> 08:18.282
- Morning.
- Hi.

08:18.284 --> 08:20.284
<i>"...sinful, salacious,</i>

08:20.286 --> 08:22.085
<i>"and extraneous materials.</i>

08:22.087 --> 08:24.654
"All reading material
and films and television

08:24.656 --> 08:27.090
are off limits
while inside the program."

08:29.262 --> 08:32.530
<i>I am using sexual sin</i>

08:32.532 --> 08:34.332
and homosexuality

08:34.335 --> 08:37.501
to fill a God-shaped void
in my life.

08:37.504 --> 08:39.672
I am using sexual sin

08:39.674 --> 08:43.876
and homosexuality to fill
a God-shaped void in my life.

08:43.879 --> 08:48.315
But I am not broken,
and God loves me.

08:48.317 --> 08:49.883
But I am not broken,

08:49.885 --> 08:52.820
- and God loves me.
- Good. That is very true.

08:52.822 --> 08:56.626
Now, somebody tell me
what this is.

08:57.860 --> 08:59.328
Dollar.

08:59.330 --> 09:02.630
A dollar.
Now, no matter how much

09:02.632 --> 09:04.866
you crumple up a dollar bill...

09:04.868 --> 09:07.471
you can never take away
its value.

09:08.505 --> 09:11.641
Now, even if you were
to rip it...

09:11.643 --> 09:14.310
which would represent
our being severed from Christ...

09:14.312 --> 09:16.714
well, guess what?

09:16.716 --> 09:19.483
You can always
tape it back together.

09:19.485 --> 09:21.819
Jesus puts us back together.

09:21.821 --> 09:24.488
And even though
there is a scar,

09:24.490 --> 09:26.824
our value does not change.

09:26.826 --> 09:29.761
- You are somebody.
- Sorry.

09:29.763 --> 09:32.331
You are worth something.
That's okay, Jon. Sit down.

09:32.333 --> 09:33.666
And that is a fact.

09:33.668 --> 09:35.768
Don't spend it
all at once, Phillip.

09:35.770 --> 09:37.737
Now, this may be the toughest

09:37.739 --> 09:41.575
but most rewarding 12 days that
many of you will ever face.

09:41.577 --> 09:43.577
But we have just one task:

09:43.579 --> 09:47.948
to bring ourselves back to God.

09:47.950 --> 09:49.750
To invite him back in.

09:49.752 --> 09:51.753
To understand how
he truly meant to create us

09:51.755 --> 09:54.223
before all those pieces
got torn away.

09:54.225 --> 09:57.126
Now, look, I know
the road here wasn't easy

09:57.128 --> 09:58.861
for many of you.

09:58.863 --> 10:01.630
But I promise a smoother ride
now that you're here,

10:01.632 --> 10:08.038
because we are about to go
on an amazing journey together.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.908
So who's ready?

10:11.411 --> 10:14.778
That was a question.
Who's ready? Say "amen."

10:14.780 --> 10:16.547
- Amen.
- Amen.

10:16.549 --> 10:19.217
If you know you're worth
a dollar, say "amen."

10:19.219 --> 10:21.420
Amen.

10:21.422 --> 10:23.423
Welcome to the Refuge program!

10:23.425 --> 10:26.224
Come on!

10:26.226 --> 10:28.228
<i>That's right, great souls!</i>

10:28.230 --> 10:29.962
<i>Great!</i>

10:38.908 --> 10:40.909
<i>Now, I'm gonna tell you
something that's</i>

10:40.911 --> 10:44.079
<i>gonna make you immediately
feel a little better.</i>

10:44.081 --> 10:47.015
People tell you you can be
born gay; that's not true.

10:47.017 --> 10:50.419
You cannot be born
a homosexual; this is a lie.

10:50.421 --> 10:53.356
Now, I'm a counselor
and a pastor,

10:53.358 --> 10:55.492
but was I born that way?

10:55.494 --> 10:57.360
No.

10:57.362 --> 11:01.098
It's behavioral. It's a choice.

11:01.100 --> 11:05.103
Cameron, you-you, uh,
play football?

11:05.105 --> 11:06.604
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

11:06.606 --> 11:08.306
Were you born that way?

11:08.308 --> 11:09.941
- No.
- No.

11:09.943 --> 11:13.278
Now, you chose to be
a football player, right?

11:13.280 --> 11:14.779
It's behavior.

11:14.781 --> 11:16.815
Now, if you... if Cameron
stops playing football,

11:16.817 --> 11:18.518
he no longer is
a football player.

11:18.520 --> 11:21.788
We got to learn for ourselves
where behavior comes from,

11:21.790 --> 11:23.289
so we can cut it out,

11:23.291 --> 11:26.626
and then we can no longer
be labeled that way.

11:26.628 --> 11:29.396
Now, who could tell us
what a genogram is?

11:29.398 --> 11:30.798
Phillip.

11:30.800 --> 11:33.167
Well, a genogram's
like a family tree,

11:33.169 --> 11:36.538
only one that shows patterns
of family behavior as well.

11:36.540 --> 11:38.306
Sort of like
an illustrated one.

11:38.308 --> 11:42.644
Yes. Now, we are going to draw
our family tree,

11:42.646 --> 11:45.214
and we're gonna list
next to these people

11:45.216 --> 11:47.216
their behavioral sin.

11:47.218 --> 11:50.019
So, they made us...

11:50.021 --> 11:52.656
and they labeled us,
so we're gonna label them.

11:52.658 --> 11:55.694
Michael, can you read
the behavioral sins?

11:57.330 --> 12:00.697
We use the letters "SSA" or "H"

12:00.699 --> 12:05.371
to label same sex attraction
or homosexuality.

12:05.373 --> 12:07.506
"D" for drugs.

12:07.508 --> 12:10.276
A dollar sign for gambling.

12:10.278 --> 12:12.778
"A," alcoholism.

12:12.780 --> 12:15.382
"P," promiscuity.

12:15.384 --> 12:18.084
"M," mental illness.

12:18.086 --> 12:21.255
Capital "A" lowercase "B"
for abortion.

12:21.257 --> 12:24.292
Capital "P" lowercase "O"
for pornography.

12:24.294 --> 12:27.728
And "C" or "G,"
criminal or gang affiliation.

12:27.730 --> 12:30.265
Forgetting "DV,"
domestic violence.

12:30.267 --> 12:33.969
Capital "D" lowercase
"V," domestic violence.

12:33.971 --> 12:36.238
Okay, guys,
let's dive right in.

12:36.240 --> 12:39.443
Let's grab some cards
and some markers.

12:39.445 --> 12:42.246
I want you to write 'em down...

12:42.248 --> 12:44.881
and put the letters
next to their name.

12:44.883 --> 12:46.916
I know they're family,

12:46.918 --> 12:50.387
but I can guarantee that one
or some of these people

12:50.389 --> 12:53.727
are the reason that
you're at Love in Action.

12:55.162 --> 12:58.897
So, Jared, you must be
the preacher's son.

12:58.899 --> 13:01.833
You know or you don't know.

13:01.835 --> 13:04.571
What's the question mark for?

13:04.573 --> 13:07.309
Uncle Chris is an alcoholic.

13:09.645 --> 13:11.278
Hmm.

13:11.280 --> 13:15.015
Well, this must be pretty tough
on your family, hmm?

13:15.017 --> 13:18.753
"Give ear,
O my people, to my law.

13:18.755 --> 13:21.322
"Incline your ears
to the words of my mouth.

13:21.324 --> 13:24.158
"I will open my mouth
in a parable.

13:24.160 --> 13:27.497
I will utter dark sayings
which we have heard."

13:27.499 --> 13:30.799
- No.
- Sounds good, Dad.

13:30.801 --> 13:32.669
Are you ready?
We got to get going.

13:32.671 --> 13:34.938
Why are we going
to Dallas tomorrow?

13:34.940 --> 13:37.941
Architect's updated the, uh,
remodel plans for the ministry,

13:37.943 --> 13:39.944
and we're gonna take a tour

13:39.946 --> 13:42.949
of two similar churches
right there.

13:44.217 --> 13:46.784
Do you think
I could stay at Chloe's

13:46.786 --> 13:48.955
when you go, instead?

13:52.026 --> 13:53.459
It's okay,
I can stay at Wayne's.

13:53.461 --> 13:55.561
- Or-or I'll just...
- I am okay with that.

13:55.563 --> 13:58.331
In fact, I think
it is a great idea.

13:58.333 --> 14:00.199
You're both mature kids

14:00.201 --> 14:02.302
who know how
to conduct themselves,

14:02.304 --> 14:05.039
and who, by now,
know how the world works.

14:06.208 --> 14:10.712
You know, son,
small steps toward manhood.

14:10.714 --> 14:12.547
That's the way to learn.

14:12.549 --> 14:14.649
That way you don't
get all panicky

14:14.651 --> 14:17.920
when it suddenly arrives.

14:17.922 --> 14:19.989
You do know
what I'm saying, Romeo?

14:19.991 --> 14:21.991
- Yes, sir.
- Okay. Let's go. We're late.

14:21.993 --> 14:23.694
<i>Dear Heavenly Father,</i>

14:23.696 --> 14:25.662
<i>we thank you
for this beautiful day.</i>

14:25.664 --> 14:28.065
<i>And, Lord, we pray
that you look over our shoulder</i>

14:28.067 --> 14:30.568
<i>as we march out onto the floor,</i>

14:30.570 --> 14:33.003
<i>and that we show our customers
the love and kindness</i>

14:33.005 --> 14:34.905
<i>that you show us.</i>

14:34.907 --> 14:36.873
<i>In Jesus Christ's name,
and for his sake...</i>

14:36.875 --> 14:38.710
Morning! Let your light shine!

14:38.712 --> 14:40.045
- Amen.
- Amen.

14:40.047 --> 14:41.580
- All right!
- Have a great day.

14:50.191 --> 14:52.460
"Rebels" on three!
On three! One, two, three!

14:52.462 --> 14:54.027
Rebels!

14:57.367 --> 14:59.367
You did so good.

15:00.803 --> 15:02.269
Right, buddy? Assists,

15:02.271 --> 15:04.873
one of the most underrated
components of the game.

15:04.875 --> 15:05.874
- Congratulations.
- I saw you

15:05.876 --> 15:07.376
setting up all the points.

15:07.378 --> 15:09.444
- Oh! That's victory sweat.
- Dad, I... - Yeah.

15:09.446 --> 15:11.113
I-I played, like, five minutes.

15:11.115 --> 15:13.081
- I think you did more than that. How about you?
- Hey!

15:13.083 --> 15:15.284
- Another underrated component of the game.
- Thank you.

15:15.286 --> 15:17.153
- How are you?
- Congratulations, beautiful girl.

15:17.155 --> 15:18.921
I was worried about you.
I thought they were

15:18.923 --> 15:20.457
- gonna drop you. Oh.
- Oh, no, don't worry.

15:20.459 --> 15:22.559
- Are you kids gonna go celebrate?
- Yeah, some of us,

15:22.561 --> 15:24.061
- I think we're gonna go to the lake.
- Yeah.

15:24.063 --> 15:27.599
All right. The lake.

15:27.601 --> 15:29.234
All right.

15:29.236 --> 15:31.403
Dealership's gonna put me
in an Expedition,

15:31.405 --> 15:33.405
so it's yours.

15:33.407 --> 15:35.273
Wow. Dad.

15:35.275 --> 15:36.742
All right. All right.
It was gonna be

15:36.744 --> 15:39.078
for your birthday, but, you
know, tonight's a good night,

15:39.080 --> 15:40.414
- so congratulations.
- Thank you so much.

15:40.416 --> 15:42.948
- Thank you.
- Go and have fun.

15:42.950 --> 15:44.950
I want to see if your mama
wants to go to the lake.

16:22.128 --> 16:23.662
They're still up.

16:41.551 --> 16:43.052
What?

16:48.057 --> 16:50.758
I-If it's not hard,
I can make it hard.

16:50.760 --> 16:54.029
Don't you think
we should wait until,

16:54.031 --> 16:56.432
- you know...
- Until...

16:56.434 --> 17:00.503
- You know?
- Until what? We get married?

17:02.541 --> 17:06.743
That's what my parents
think we should do.

17:06.746 --> 17:09.848
To keep us together
through college.

17:15.723 --> 17:17.424
Hey.

17:19.861 --> 17:22.227
Is something wrong?

17:22.229 --> 17:24.365
No.

17:26.701 --> 17:29.202
Jared.

17:29.204 --> 17:32.038
Ready to pack it up?
We're about done for the day.

17:32.040 --> 17:34.708
Looks nice.

17:34.710 --> 17:37.311
5:00, everyone.
It's home time.

17:37.313 --> 17:40.551
- Bye.
- 5:00. Let's go.

17:43.387 --> 17:45.588
All right, everybody,

17:45.590 --> 17:47.489
pack it up.

17:47.491 --> 17:50.091
Name tag.

17:50.093 --> 17:53.265
- Thanks.
- 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

18:00.239 --> 18:02.006
Uh...

18:02.008 --> 18:04.910
hey, y-you tore out the pages.

18:04.912 --> 18:07.178
- Mm.
- They're just stories.

18:07.180 --> 18:08.747
Mr. Sykes will decide that.

18:08.749 --> 18:11.584
...to Michael.

18:11.586 --> 18:15.524
- Go for Michael.
- Are you still in the office?

18:35.813 --> 18:37.613
Are you, are you a soldier?

18:37.615 --> 18:39.616
Were you in the military,
or some...?

18:39.618 --> 18:42.318
- I saw you salute earlier. I thought...
- No.

18:42.320 --> 18:45.788
I'm trying zero contact
whatsoever.

18:45.790 --> 18:49.059
- Mm.
- 23 days now.

18:49.061 --> 18:53.033
So... I salute instead.

18:54.568 --> 18:58.135
This group seems good.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.471
Have you been here before?

18:59.473 --> 19:02.674
Yeah, it's my second time
in the Refuge program.

19:02.676 --> 19:04.644
I started a couple days late
last time,

19:04.646 --> 19:06.980
and actually I'm waiting
for a place to open

19:06.982 --> 19:08.982
in one of the houses.

19:08.984 --> 19:11.550
- What houses?
- The-the houses. The...

19:11.552 --> 19:13.820
They have a few houses
behind the property

19:13.822 --> 19:15.489
for the long stayers.

19:15.491 --> 19:18.325
Meanwhile,
I'm stuck at the Baybrook

19:18.327 --> 19:21.364
with my dad,
which is interesting.

19:23.533 --> 19:27.002
Are you in one of
the local hotels, too?

19:27.004 --> 19:28.673
Yeah.

19:30.508 --> 19:33.511
So, like, how-how long
will you stay for?

19:35.113 --> 19:37.113
It's not really up to me.

19:37.115 --> 19:39.517
Mr. Sykes decides.

19:39.519 --> 19:43.286
- No one explained that to you?
- No, no.

19:43.288 --> 19:45.923
This is just
an assessment program,

19:45.925 --> 19:49.694
until they know
what to do with you.

19:49.696 --> 19:51.863
Hey. Listen.

19:51.865 --> 19:53.866
Just lean into it, man.

19:53.868 --> 19:55.467
Yeah.

19:55.469 --> 19:58.938
Do the work,
and trust me, man...

19:58.940 --> 20:01.473
you're gonna love it here.

20:01.475 --> 20:04.310
<i>Aren't you gonna tell me
about your day?</i>

20:04.312 --> 20:07.781
We're not meant to talk
about it outside of group.

20:07.783 --> 20:09.116
I don't need gossip.

20:09.118 --> 20:12.953
I just...
I just mean generally.

20:12.955 --> 20:14.957
I'm gonna lean into it.

20:14.959 --> 20:17.059
And there are some good people.

20:17.061 --> 20:19.729
And, yeah, I like it.

20:19.731 --> 20:21.664
I'm excited to be here.

20:21.666 --> 20:24.102
That's good.

20:30.142 --> 20:32.609
Do we have people in the family

20:32.611 --> 20:35.814
who had issues
with any of this stuff?

20:46.861 --> 20:48.861
Pornography?

20:48.863 --> 20:51.433
Mom.

20:55.937 --> 20:57.804
Drugs?

20:57.806 --> 20:59.006
Gang affiliat...

20:59.008 --> 21:01.274
Gang affiliations?
What is this?

21:01.276 --> 21:03.145
I need to know for homework.

21:03.147 --> 21:06.148
Why do they need to know
about the family?

21:06.150 --> 21:08.819
Our family is so normal.

21:35.816 --> 21:39.084
Big day tomorrow, hmm?

21:39.086 --> 21:41.556
You get some good sleep, now.

21:45.560 --> 21:48.663
Oh, um, I filled out
your homework for you.

21:51.835 --> 21:55.503
I was only in a gang
for a year or so, until I...

21:55.505 --> 22:00.242
went down for drugs,
got sent to prison.

22:00.244 --> 22:01.709
Ha-ha.

22:07.685 --> 22:10.619
I put your Uncle Vincent
down there.

22:10.621 --> 22:13.555
You've never met him, 'cause
he, uh, moved to Louisiana

22:13.557 --> 22:17.962
when you were little, so...
we just never see him.

22:17.964 --> 22:20.600
We always figured that he...

22:26.707 --> 22:31.043
He was very feminine-like,
you might say.

22:31.045 --> 22:33.478
All right.

22:33.480 --> 22:36.317
Oh. I'm tired.

22:37.552 --> 22:39.722
- Night-night.
- Good night.

22:47.330 --> 22:50.665
<i>What is... a real man?</i>

22:50.667 --> 22:54.236
<i>And what does
a real man look like?</i>

22:54.238 --> 22:56.406
<i>Does anybody know?</i>

22:57.942 --> 22:59.909
Guys, uncross your legs.

22:59.911 --> 23:01.510
Posture. Come on.

23:01.512 --> 23:04.447
Now, perhaps being close

23:04.449 --> 23:08.919
to the flames of hell
and finding your way back

23:08.921 --> 23:11.088
shows a great strength.

23:11.090 --> 23:15.160
And if that were so, then...
if this isn't a real man,

23:15.162 --> 23:17.162
then I don't know what is.

23:17.164 --> 23:18.462
This is Brandon Ellis, guys.

23:18.464 --> 23:20.332
- I want you to say hello.
- Thanks, Sykes.

23:20.334 --> 23:22.267
Make him welcome.
Over to you, Brandon.

23:22.269 --> 23:23.604
Thank you.

23:24.538 --> 23:27.440
God bless. God bless.

23:27.442 --> 23:28.942
A real man, to me,

23:28.944 --> 23:31.678
is a man of God,
first and foremost.

23:31.680 --> 23:34.681
And I'm a man of God, no doubt.

23:34.683 --> 23:37.952
I guess that counts me in.

23:37.954 --> 23:40.121
But I wasn't once.

23:40.123 --> 23:43.524
If I was ever listed
on my own son's genograms,

23:43.526 --> 23:45.961
there'd be so many of these
letters next to my name,

23:45.963 --> 23:48.331
it would look
like qualifications

23:48.333 --> 23:50.633
for some fancy university.

23:50.635 --> 23:53.002
Drugs, violence, gang crime,

23:53.004 --> 23:55.205
prison time,
but I actually believe

23:55.207 --> 23:57.007
I'm qualified to be here.

23:57.009 --> 24:00.210
Not because I've ever had the
types of thoughts and feelings

24:00.212 --> 24:01.912
that y'all are wrestling with

24:01.914 --> 24:03.547
or that your other
guidance counselors

24:03.549 --> 24:05.515
have overcome righteously.

24:05.517 --> 24:07.752
But I've had all sorts
of my own trials

24:07.754 --> 24:10.321
that took me so far away
from the Lord

24:10.323 --> 24:12.424
that it is a true miracle

24:12.426 --> 24:14.996
that I'm standing here
before you today.

24:16.331 --> 24:18.231
But I am.

24:18.233 --> 24:20.335
I am.

24:24.840 --> 24:28.342
<i>Standing, leaning, sitting.</i>

24:28.344 --> 24:30.044
<i>All the same idea.</i>

24:30.046 --> 24:33.514
Triangles are
the strongest shape.

24:33.516 --> 24:36.451
Hand or hands on hips. Go!

24:36.453 --> 24:38.889
Save yourself.

24:40.724 --> 24:43.525
Fingers forward, not back.

24:43.527 --> 24:45.228
Just the way it is.

24:45.230 --> 24:49.065
Think of the shapes
you're making and ask yourself:

24:49.067 --> 24:51.602
Is this a manly shape
I'm making,

24:51.604 --> 24:55.373
or is it a girly
or feminine shape?

24:55.375 --> 24:56.907
Sarah, come on up here.

24:56.909 --> 25:00.111
Come on,
you delicate flower, you.

25:00.113 --> 25:01.545
Okay.

25:01.547 --> 25:05.384
I want you to arrange
these guys into a line

25:05.386 --> 25:08.089
in terms of masculinity,
if you will.

25:09.290 --> 25:11.589
Go on, you can do it.

25:11.591 --> 25:13.928
Follow your instincts.

25:16.298 --> 25:18.632
Myself and other addicts
and alcoholics

25:18.634 --> 25:20.734
put our faith in AA.

25:20.736 --> 25:23.237
- Get familiar with this phrase:
<i>- Knees up!</i>

25:23.239 --> 25:26.140
<i>- Fake it till you make it.</i>
- Knees up! Body up! Push!

25:26.142 --> 25:30.145
<i>And y'all folks and kids, being
what you're afflicted with,</i>

25:30.147 --> 25:31.747
better learn how to survive.

25:31.749 --> 25:33.916
<i>When you're in prison,</i>

25:33.918 --> 25:37.152
<i>you'd surprise yourself
what you could do to fit in.</i>

25:37.154 --> 25:38.320
Come on, Phillip.

25:38.322 --> 25:40.491
Eye on the ball.

25:40.493 --> 25:41.858
Come on! Okay, next!

25:41.860 --> 25:44.295
<i>Fake it till you make it.</i>

25:44.297 --> 25:45.529
Become the man you are not.

25:45.531 --> 25:46.629
So you think Cameron here

25:46.631 --> 25:48.832
<i>is the big winner, huh?</i>

25:48.834 --> 25:51.369
You think being big and tall

25:51.371 --> 25:53.939
and overeating

25:53.941 --> 25:56.274
immediately puts a guy
at the front of the line.

25:56.276 --> 25:58.643
<i>But it's more than triangles
or postures</i>

25:58.645 --> 26:00.278
and genetics.

26:00.280 --> 26:01.980
Firm handshake!

26:01.982 --> 26:04.485
Let's go! Do it!

26:04.487 --> 26:06.054
You got to pick up the bat.

26:07.055 --> 26:08.455
Hold the bat up!

26:08.457 --> 26:09.822
- Ow!
- Ooh! -

26:09.824 --> 26:12.126
Get back up on that horse!

26:12.128 --> 26:15.029
All right,
just get him out of there.

26:15.031 --> 26:17.799
- Lee, you're gonna be okay.
- Come on.

26:17.801 --> 26:20.971
Jared, you're up next.

26:22.005 --> 26:23.707
That's good.

26:28.380 --> 26:30.045
Military man.

26:30.047 --> 26:31.814
God bless, son.

26:31.816 --> 26:35.818
Who you are on the inside
can be affected by the outside.

26:35.820 --> 26:39.323
Outside in.
Fake it till you make it.

26:39.325 --> 26:40.491
Adapt to survive.

26:40.493 --> 26:43.327
Ah, see,
that's a batting stance.

26:43.329 --> 26:44.563
That's what I'm talking about.

26:44.565 --> 26:46.500
Boom!

26:57.846 --> 27:00.747
<i>Lesbian, gay, bisexual,</i>

27:00.749 --> 27:02.883
transsexual...
whatever that is...

27:02.885 --> 27:05.953
multisexual,
intellectual sexual.

27:05.955 --> 27:07.955
I mean, what else do you want?

27:07.957 --> 27:10.024
Unicorns? Squirrels?

27:10.026 --> 27:12.594
Cupcakes? I mean, rainbows?

27:12.596 --> 27:15.864
There's so much choice
in this group,

27:15.866 --> 27:18.034
but, hey, think about this.

27:18.036 --> 27:23.539
What are the consequences
to those choices?

27:23.541 --> 27:25.408
Have a look at this.

27:25.410 --> 27:27.778
Rape, abuse, AIDS.

27:27.780 --> 27:31.884
What sinful things
have y'all done?

27:36.223 --> 27:38.256
<i>Moral inventory.</i>

27:38.258 --> 27:43.730
<i>Catalog your sins
and ask God's forgiveness.</i>

27:46.167 --> 27:48.570
Who is ready?

27:51.240 --> 27:53.242
Sarah.

28:06.090 --> 28:07.823
"I would look at other girls

28:07.825 --> 28:10.259
"in the changing rooms
before gym

28:10.261 --> 28:11.927
"and in the showers.

28:11.929 --> 28:15.164
"My biggest sin is one
that I am also thankful for,

28:15.166 --> 28:19.002
because it has led me
to Love in Action."

28:19.004 --> 28:21.674
Doing well, Sarah. Carry on.

28:24.710 --> 28:27.279
"I had run away
from my uncle's house

28:27.281 --> 28:29.614
"and stayed
with some girls I knew

28:29.616 --> 28:31.950
"whose parents were away.

28:31.952 --> 28:33.952
"It was there
that I finally acted

28:33.954 --> 28:36.724
on my homosexual thoughts."

28:38.960 --> 28:41.127
Come on, Sarah.

28:41.129 --> 28:43.796
"I let a girl touch my...

28:43.798 --> 28:45.532
"kiss m-my...

28:47.069 --> 28:50.003
...my vagina..."

28:50.005 --> 28:52.140
Nobody's judging. Come on.

28:52.142 --> 28:55.376
"...and put
her fingers inside me,

28:55.378 --> 28:58.179
"and I did the same.

28:58.181 --> 29:01.082
"I renounce these
sinful thoughts and actions,

29:01.084 --> 29:04.989
and ask God to forgive me
all these things."

29:05.990 --> 29:07.990
Very good.

29:07.992 --> 29:09.892
We love you, Sarah.

29:09.894 --> 29:12.495
All right, repeat after me.
We love you, Sarah.

29:12.497 --> 29:14.665
We love you, Sarah.

29:14.667 --> 29:16.336
Very good.

29:35.557 --> 29:37.557
Do you want some water?

29:37.559 --> 29:40.562
I'm fine, thanks.

29:40.564 --> 29:45.265
- Can I get you anything else?
- I'm... I'm fine, thank you.

29:45.267 --> 29:48.403
How dare you
humiliate a child like that?!

29:48.405 --> 29:51.039
Is that what you guys...
you like that?

29:51.041 --> 29:52.541
Do you like doing that?!

29:52.543 --> 29:54.543
You like humiliating
and abusing children?!

29:54.545 --> 29:57.613
- It's not easy...
- What do you mean it's not easy?!

29:57.615 --> 29:59.548
- Lee's parents.
- His parents are here.

29:59.550 --> 30:01.718
- Listen to yourself!
- With respect,

30:01.720 --> 30:05.422
- we are not running a holiday camp here.
- We paid you $3,000.

30:05.424 --> 30:07.991
I should report you. You could
have given him a concussion!

30:07.993 --> 30:09.293
David, let's go.

30:09.295 --> 30:11.462
That change doesn't come easy.

30:11.464 --> 30:13.464
Unbelievable!

30:26.013 --> 30:28.416
<i>Y'all find the reason</i>

30:28.418 --> 30:30.751
y'all are here is funny?

30:30.753 --> 30:32.586
Look at y'all!

30:32.588 --> 30:34.588
People!

30:34.590 --> 30:36.690
I'm trying to help you.

30:36.692 --> 30:38.427
So do not waste my time.

30:38.429 --> 30:41.663
Nobody is to discuss the
therapy outside these walls!

30:41.665 --> 30:43.532
Do I make myself clear?!

31:35.325 --> 31:37.826
Yo, I got your back. Whoa!

31:37.828 --> 31:39.329
- Oh, sorry, sorry.
- I got that.

31:39.331 --> 31:40.763
Thank you so much.

31:40.765 --> 31:43.399
Which, uh, which room you in?

31:43.401 --> 31:45.702
I'm in, uh, 317.

31:45.704 --> 31:47.403
Oh, I'm in 237.

31:47.405 --> 31:48.839
You run?

31:48.841 --> 31:50.174
- Yeah.
- I figure.

31:50.176 --> 31:52.042
People who run
know about ASICS, right?

31:52.044 --> 31:53.678
Oh, yeah.

31:53.680 --> 31:55.414
Here, this is me.

32:04.526 --> 32:07.760
First one in gets to choose.

32:10.866 --> 32:12.900
You got a girl?

32:12.902 --> 32:14.903
If so, you might want to think

32:14.905 --> 32:17.572
about applying for a room
without bunks.

32:17.574 --> 32:19.641
Just broke up.

32:19.643 --> 32:22.710
Oh. That's perfect timing.

32:22.712 --> 32:25.380
Before college.

32:25.382 --> 32:27.583
We're a good fit.

32:27.585 --> 32:29.385
Hate running with slowpokes.

32:29.387 --> 32:32.388
I'll tell you what,
I'll race you on the way back.

32:32.390 --> 32:35.391
Last one back has to go
to the other one's church.

32:35.393 --> 32:37.560
Why? What kind of church is it?

32:37.562 --> 32:39.429
You game or not?

32:39.431 --> 32:41.999
- All right.
- All right, one,

32:42.001 --> 32:43.968
- two, three, go!
- Two, three, go!

33:07.296 --> 33:10.798
- Ben. This is Jared.
- Hey, man, nice to meet you.

33:57.252 --> 34:00.087
Did you say your roommate's
not back till tomorrow?

34:00.089 --> 34:02.158
He's on some golf trip.

34:05.829 --> 34:07.598
Do you want to crash?

34:09.933 --> 34:12.168
Maybe.

34:31.024 --> 34:32.623
Night.

34:32.626 --> 34:34.628
Good night.

35:25.918 --> 35:28.255
Can't sleep, huh?

35:42.605 --> 35:45.541
Probably shouldn't run
so late at night.

36:03.962 --> 36:06.198
Are you okay?

36:07.966 --> 36:09.735
Yeah.

36:11.737 --> 36:13.739
Yeah, just...

37:07.033 --> 37:09.033
It's okay.

37:26.622 --> 37:31.158
Hey. It's okay. It's okay.

37:31.160 --> 37:34.262
- Wait, wait.
- Shh, shh, shh.

37:34.264 --> 37:36.831
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

37:36.833 --> 37:39.235
Shh.

37:39.237 --> 37:41.403
- Shh.
- Stop, stop, stop.

37:41.405 --> 37:43.973
Stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop!

37:55.655 --> 37:57.523
Ow!

37:59.625 --> 38:04.796
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

38:06.000 --> 38:08.267
Ow! Ow!

38:27.959 --> 38:29.693
Oh.

38:45.577 --> 38:48.914
What the hell is wrong with me?

38:50.918 --> 38:52.920
I'm so sorry.

38:57.490 --> 38:59.925
I'm gonna be
in so much trouble.

39:05.600 --> 39:09.071
I need to confess.

39:14.444 --> 39:17.714
I need to confess.
Will you hear me?

39:20.183 --> 39:22.919
- Please.
- Uh-huh.

39:28.293 --> 39:31.529
Do you remember
the kid from church?

39:33.865 --> 39:36.402
The one in front of us.

39:39.773 --> 39:43.374
Something happened
with me and him.

39:43.376 --> 39:46.480
Something pretty bad.

39:51.752 --> 39:55.754
You wouldn't dare tell anyone,
would you?

39:55.756 --> 39:57.893
Please.

39:59.660 --> 40:02.564
Keep it between us.

40:25.123 --> 40:28.928
Start with chapter six, please.

41:30.663 --> 41:33.398
What-what a surprise.

41:33.400 --> 41:35.033
Oh!

41:53.456 --> 41:55.690
- Hello.
- Is this Mrs. Nancy Eamons?

41:55.692 --> 41:57.125
This is she.

41:57.127 --> 41:59.060
I'm a counselor
at Danton College.

41:59.062 --> 42:02.064
And I'm afraid I have
some disturbing news

42:02.066 --> 42:04.200
about your son's behavior
at school.

42:04.202 --> 42:05.368
What?

42:05.370 --> 42:07.970
What about him?

42:07.972 --> 42:09.606
- Did he give you a name?
- I need you to answer

42:09.608 --> 42:10.941
- my question.
- If-if he gave you a name...

42:10.943 --> 42:11.975
- Please, Jared, just answer me.
- I'm just saying...

42:11.977 --> 42:13.376
Have you been doing
the things he says?

42:13.378 --> 42:15.379
- Why wouldn't he give you a name?
- Come on, son, enough.

42:15.381 --> 42:17.882
- Tell me the truth.
- I'm asking the questions, too.

42:17.884 --> 42:20.218
He didn't, um,
give me a name. I don't...

42:20.220 --> 42:22.220
The guy's full of shit.
He's telling a bunch of lies.

42:22.222 --> 42:23.455
Now you will not talk
like that in this house

42:23.457 --> 42:24.922
in front of your mother.
You just watch your mouth.

42:24.924 --> 42:26.925
Nancy, if-if you could
just give us a moment,

42:26.927 --> 42:28.894
- you know, just to...
- I'm-I'm leaving.

42:28.896 --> 42:30.829
- I'm-I'm...
- Sit down. You will not leave the room.

42:30.831 --> 42:32.298
You will sit down, boy.

42:32.300 --> 42:34.067
- You will sit down.
- It's bullshit, Dad.

42:34.069 --> 42:37.571
- It's bullshit.
- I just asked you to watch your mouth!

42:37.573 --> 42:42.644
I think, um,
he said he was a counselor.

42:42.646 --> 42:44.745
And then...
and I asked for his name,

42:44.747 --> 42:46.080
- and then I asked for...
- Nancy.

42:46.082 --> 42:48.115
- You see?
- ...his number and he didn't...

42:48.117 --> 42:49.251
Nancy, please.

42:49.253 --> 42:51.254
Dad, I-I...

42:51.256 --> 42:53.422
He's made all of this up.

42:53.424 --> 42:56.492
Let's just sit here.
We're just gonna talk calmly.

42:56.494 --> 42:58.794
All right. All right.

42:58.796 --> 43:00.630
No, Dad.

43:00.632 --> 43:02.835
Jared.

43:05.304 --> 43:08.305
I just need you to tell me
the truth, that's all.

43:08.307 --> 43:12.976
What this man says of you...
Jared.

43:12.978 --> 43:16.150
Are you a homosexual?

43:20.454 --> 43:23.355
Jared. We are not finished!

43:23.357 --> 43:26.126
- I am, because you won't listen!
- Honey. Honey.

43:26.128 --> 43:28.328
What this man says,
is it true?

43:28.330 --> 43:29.229
What this full-of-shit guy,

43:29.231 --> 43:31.231
- who is not a counselor...
- Answer me!

43:31.233 --> 43:35.236
...who raped a kid
at-at his own church,

43:35.238 --> 43:37.506
and God knows who else!

43:37.508 --> 43:40.142
- Dad, you're hurting me.
- Marshall.

43:40.144 --> 43:42.577
His name is Henry Wallace.
He's-he's not a counselor.

43:42.579 --> 43:44.346
- He's a student.
- All right.

43:44.348 --> 43:47.816
And-and... he told me
he did some bad things.

43:47.818 --> 43:51.321
I think he thinks
I'm gonna tell on him.

43:51.323 --> 43:53.524
Honey.

43:53.526 --> 43:55.695
Son.

44:07.674 --> 44:09.441
Fight!

44:18.687 --> 44:20.855
Go to war!

44:31.534 --> 44:33.937
Your mother's making dinner.

44:35.740 --> 44:38.909
I'm okay, I'm not hungry.

44:43.047 --> 44:46.149
I want you to write down
this man's name,

44:46.151 --> 44:49.821
his church,
phone number if you have it.

44:49.823 --> 44:51.823
Any information at all.

44:51.825 --> 44:53.792
I don't want you
to talk to him.

44:53.794 --> 44:55.126
I ain't gonna talk to him.

44:55.128 --> 44:57.128
If he's been doing
what you say,

44:57.130 --> 44:59.767
then he needs to be reported.

45:02.737 --> 45:04.903
Okay.

45:04.905 --> 45:06.672
Now, you know what I did?

45:06.674 --> 45:09.142
I invited Chloe and her parents
for lunch tomorrow.

45:09.144 --> 45:12.145
And I was thinking it'd be fun
if you could join in.

45:12.147 --> 45:16.116
Missing one more day of class
ain't gonna end the world.

45:16.118 --> 45:18.520
You know, Jared...

45:18.522 --> 45:21.823
...far as I can tell,

45:21.825 --> 45:24.426
we've only got
one God-given right,

45:24.428 --> 45:28.364
and that is when a man
and a woman come together,

45:28.366 --> 45:32.168
they may create life.

45:32.170 --> 45:35.171
You think how much God
must love mankind

45:35.173 --> 45:37.373
to give us that
awesome responsibility.

45:37.375 --> 45:39.376
Dad.

45:39.378 --> 45:42.449
It's really not true.

45:48.188 --> 45:52.191
You know what I think about
these type of games, too.

45:52.193 --> 45:55.828
Be respectful to your mother
when she calls.

45:55.830 --> 45:58.499
You come down and eat.

46:32.103 --> 46:34.938
- Honey.
- All right.

46:34.940 --> 46:36.874
You want me to stop
with the games?

46:36.876 --> 46:38.576
I'll stop with them.

46:38.578 --> 46:40.445
I broke up with Chloe.

46:40.447 --> 46:43.049
Because...

46:48.221 --> 46:53.194
We broke up because
I think it's true, about me.

46:55.029 --> 46:57.099
God help me.

46:58.867 --> 47:01.604
I think about men.

47:13.752 --> 47:16.488
I don't know why.

47:18.823 --> 47:21.493
I'm so sorry.

48:11.984 --> 48:13.718
God bless you, Pastor.

48:13.720 --> 48:15.019
Thank you, guys, for coming.

48:20.360 --> 48:24.127
I've had better days,
I can tell you that.

48:30.638 --> 48:33.472
Just a minute. Just a minute.

48:33.474 --> 48:36.009
- Mom?
- Hold on.

48:36.011 --> 48:38.045
All right.

48:41.383 --> 48:46.487
Wh... Why are Pastor Wilkes
and Jim Picard here?

48:46.489 --> 48:50.394
Pastor Wilkes has dealt with
this kind of thing before.

48:51.996 --> 48:57.733
Jim has a son, Eddie, who, um...
y-you were a little boy, but...

48:57.735 --> 48:59.702
Anyway.

48:59.704 --> 49:01.237
What'd they do to him?

49:01.239 --> 49:04.273
Oh, no. You silly thing.

49:04.275 --> 49:06.275
They didn't do anything to him.

49:06.277 --> 49:11.415
They did things for him,
all right?

49:11.417 --> 49:14.852
Just like they're gonna
do things for you.

49:14.854 --> 49:18.023
Your father's wondering...

49:18.025 --> 49:20.627
he's wondering how to help.

49:23.064 --> 49:24.930
Come here.

49:24.932 --> 49:27.467
It's all gonna be all right.

49:29.738 --> 49:32.372
We've got one question
for you, son.

49:32.374 --> 49:34.040
And then we're gonna
let you sleep.

49:34.042 --> 49:37.478
It's been a big day.

49:37.480 --> 49:41.649
I have shared our conversations

49:41.651 --> 49:43.652
with these two
fine upstanding men,

49:43.654 --> 49:46.456
and I have asked them
for their guidance.

49:48.257 --> 49:50.126
I can tell you right now,

49:50.128 --> 49:51.794
we don't have all the answers.

49:51.796 --> 49:57.067
But I do know that you gonna
hold the key to the next step.

49:57.069 --> 50:01.338
Your mother and I,
we cannot see

50:01.340 --> 50:04.241
a way that you can live
under this roof,

50:04.243 --> 50:07.579
attend service
and work at the dealership

50:07.581 --> 50:09.581
if you're gonna fundamentally

50:09.583 --> 50:12.917
go against the grain
of our beliefs.

50:12.919 --> 50:15.454
And against God himself.

50:15.456 --> 50:19.794
I'm gonna ask you
that question now, son.

50:23.297 --> 50:25.601
In your heart...

50:28.104 --> 50:30.840
...do you want to change?

50:50.897 --> 50:53.396
Yes.

50:53.398 --> 50:55.835
Yes, I want to change.

50:59.405 --> 51:01.640
Come a little closer, son.

51:01.642 --> 51:04.543
Pastor Wilkes,

51:04.545 --> 51:08.747
could you ask Jesus
to shine his light

51:08.749 --> 51:12.484
on my boy at this time?

51:12.486 --> 51:15.989
Heavenly Father, I ask
your blessing for this family.

51:15.991 --> 51:17.658
Give them strength.

51:17.660 --> 51:23.330
Unleash your power
for one of your flock, Jared,

51:23.332 --> 51:25.433
who has lost his way.

51:25.435 --> 51:28.938
We pray, Lord,
that you make him pure

51:28.940 --> 51:32.208
and that you return him
safely back to us

51:32.210 --> 51:34.542
and see that the errors
of his way

51:34.544 --> 51:38.715
are nothing more than
a momentary straying.

51:38.717 --> 51:41.518
We pray that he see
the path of faith

51:41.520 --> 51:45.755
<i>and that he strive to be honest</i>

51:45.757 --> 51:49.962
<i>and that he then find the joy
of a new life.</i>

51:49.964 --> 51:52.064
<i>In his name we pray.</i>

51:52.066 --> 51:53.764
<i>Amen.</i>

51:53.766 --> 51:55.468
Jared.

52:00.541 --> 52:02.809
How's college treating you?

52:02.811 --> 52:05.211
Ah, it's going good. Yeah.

52:05.213 --> 52:07.947
- It's good.
- Your father's asked me

52:07.949 --> 52:10.253
to take some of your blood.

52:13.056 --> 52:17.393
He wants me to... to check
for testosterone levels.

52:20.130 --> 52:23.465
I'm in a bit of
a bind here, Jared,

52:23.467 --> 52:25.768
and I-I said this
to your mother, too.

52:25.770 --> 52:29.906
Now, I am a religious woman,
there's-there's no-no question,

52:29.908 --> 52:32.942
but I have also been
to medical school,

52:32.944 --> 52:37.447
and... well, you could say that
I hold science in one hand

52:37.449 --> 52:40.251
and God in the other,
and that is not always

52:40.253 --> 52:42.687
an easy balance.

52:42.689 --> 52:46.491
And I know that everybody would
like for me to say otherwise

52:46.493 --> 52:50.095
and send you down
to the pharmacy for a-a pill

52:50.097 --> 52:53.999
that would magically fix you,
but that's not gonna happen.

52:54.001 --> 52:56.269
But I'm gonna take your blood,
and I know,

52:56.271 --> 52:58.271
I know what it's gonna show me.

52:58.273 --> 53:00.606
That you are
a perfectly normal,

53:00.608 --> 53:03.010
very healthy teenage boy.

53:03.012 --> 53:06.347
Jared, it's-it's not my place

53:06.349 --> 53:09.283
to tell you
that your parents are wrong,

53:09.285 --> 53:12.687
but let's say
that they are wrong.

53:12.689 --> 53:14.690
I understand
your father signed you up

53:14.692 --> 53:17.626
for a program next month.

53:17.628 --> 53:23.866
Whatever happens next,
it is still your choice.

53:23.868 --> 53:27.972
It may not feel that way,
but it is.

53:27.974 --> 53:29.974
You're 18.

53:29.976 --> 53:34.478
Do you have anything
that you'd...

53:34.480 --> 53:38.016
you'd like to say to me?

53:38.018 --> 53:41.655
Any-any questions?

53:44.758 --> 53:46.660
No.

53:50.332 --> 53:52.432
Jared?

53:52.434 --> 53:54.370
Morning.

54:05.449 --> 54:11.186
So... I wanted to talk to you
about these.

54:11.188 --> 54:13.189
Uh, your writing?

54:13.191 --> 54:18.362
This, uh,
"Remy and Lucy met at midnight

54:18.364 --> 54:22.966
under the stars
on Willow Street."

54:22.968 --> 54:26.704
What-what...
tell me about these.

54:26.706 --> 54:29.910
Well, it's-it's just,
it's-it's a story.

54:31.712 --> 54:35.080
It's a love story about
a boy and a girl, correct?

54:35.082 --> 54:36.715
- Yeah.
- But were you

54:36.717 --> 54:41.120
thinking about two boys
when you wrote this?

54:41.122 --> 54:42.655
No.

54:42.657 --> 54:44.557
I mean, be honest.

54:44.559 --> 54:47.760
No. It's just a story.

54:47.762 --> 54:50.733
It's just an assignment
for college.

54:52.568 --> 54:54.903
Jared, I've seen your
reading list for college.

54:54.905 --> 54:56.838
I have it here, and listen,

54:56.840 --> 54:59.441
<i>The Picture of Dorian Gray,
Lolita,</i>

54:59.443 --> 55:01.911
I-I mean, some of
th-these books, Jared,

55:01.913 --> 55:03.846
considering everything that's
going on for you right now,

55:03.848 --> 55:05.915
I don't know that college
is really the best thing

55:05.917 --> 55:08.087
for you to be pursuing at all.

55:09.088 --> 55:10.753
A year with us may be

55:10.755 --> 55:13.759
a much, much better use
of your time.

55:15.594 --> 55:19.430
Given everything that I see.

55:19.432 --> 55:22.436
And everything that's at stake.

55:24.003 --> 55:28.607
And I'm willing to say that
to your parents.

55:28.609 --> 55:30.943
Listen, I've had many
wonderful conversations

55:30.945 --> 55:32.611
with your parents...
lovely people.

55:32.613 --> 55:35.515
So, I know some of the story,

55:35.517 --> 55:39.186
and I know that there is
quite a discrepancy

55:39.188 --> 55:43.824
between what they were told
and what you said.

55:43.826 --> 55:46.727
And you got to understand that

55:46.729 --> 55:48.696
they don't know
what to believe,

55:48.698 --> 55:51.633
and that's very troubling
for them.

55:51.635 --> 55:54.836
But I think that you and I know

55:54.838 --> 55:57.907
that there is a whole lot more
to the story,

55:57.909 --> 56:02.548
and, you know, we're not here
on mere thoughts alone.

56:05.985 --> 56:09.153
Jared, the-the people who get
the most out of this place

56:09.155 --> 56:13.425
are the people that are just
really brave and-and honest

56:13.427 --> 56:17.096
and-and lay everything on
the table, ugly as it seems,

56:17.098 --> 56:20.234
and-and fess up
to what God already sees.

56:22.403 --> 56:25.405
And then I can
really truly assess

56:25.407 --> 56:27.943
what is the best future
for you.

56:30.946 --> 56:32.948
Okay, son?

56:35.418 --> 56:39.288
Yeah. Yeah.

56:40.624 --> 56:43.258
<i>Dear Heavenly Father,</i>

56:43.260 --> 56:46.962
<i>today I ask your forgiveness
for my sins.</i>

56:46.964 --> 56:49.533
<i>For a year, we lived together
under the cover</i>

56:49.535 --> 56:50.869
<i>of being roommates.</i>

56:51.703 --> 56:54.103
But in reality, the whole time,

56:54.105 --> 56:56.940
I was committing
the sin of sodomy.

56:56.942 --> 56:58.875
And then my family
discovered the truth

56:58.877 --> 57:00.811
and brought me back
to my senses.

57:00.813 --> 57:04.149
They helped me realize
that I was fooling myself.

57:04.151 --> 57:07.719
That I was being fooled.

57:07.721 --> 57:09.955
That I was seduced
into a life of sin

57:09.957 --> 57:11.890
by all sorts of sinful people.

57:11.892 --> 57:14.060
And I knew in my heart

57:14.062 --> 57:16.597
that I had forsaken Jesus
for Satan.

57:16.599 --> 57:18.231
But now...

57:21.604 --> 57:23.503
...I am awake to my sins.

57:23.505 --> 57:25.473
I'm enlightened.

57:25.475 --> 57:27.575
I'm here with all of you.

57:27.577 --> 57:31.948
And I am disgusted at
the person that I once was.

57:33.783 --> 57:37.786
I want to ask God
for his forgiveness,

57:37.788 --> 57:40.290
and I want to thank
all of you guys,

57:40.292 --> 57:41.857
especially you, Mr. Sykes,

57:41.859 --> 57:45.428
for helping me get back
on the path to righteousness.

57:45.430 --> 57:47.497
We love you, Gary.

57:47.499 --> 57:50.434
We love you, Gary.

58:03.851 --> 58:07.220
Please don't do that, honey.
You know I don't...

58:07.222 --> 58:10.223
Mom, who did that happen to
and when? Seriously.

58:10.225 --> 58:11.790
Do you know?

58:11.792 --> 58:13.827
Do you actually know
who that happened to?

58:16.733 --> 58:20.968
It never happened.

58:23.039 --> 58:25.807
Parents want to
protect their kids.

58:25.809 --> 58:27.543
So they feed them lies.

58:27.545 --> 58:29.145
I think that they're okay lies.

58:29.147 --> 58:33.549
What? Like not telling me
how long I might be here for?

58:33.551 --> 58:37.054
You know, the whole thing
you and Dad are paying for here

58:37.056 --> 58:40.357
is all about how messed up
we are by our parents.

58:40.359 --> 58:41.391
They want to know about you.

58:41.393 --> 58:43.393
That's why you can't know
all about it,

58:43.395 --> 58:45.829
'cause then they wouldn't
get their money out of you.

58:45.831 --> 58:49.000
What have I ever
done to you? Hmm?

58:49.002 --> 58:53.038
Talk about me all you want.
My conscience is clean.

59:00.581 --> 59:03.784
Honey.

59:20.871 --> 59:24.272
I'm gonna go for a run.
Is that okay, Mom?

59:24.274 --> 59:26.044
Mm-hmm.

01:00:21.873 --> 01:00:23.375
Fuck you!

01:00:26.512 --> 01:00:28.512
Fuck you!

01:00:36.122 --> 01:00:37.989
Fuck you!

01:00:41.995 --> 01:00:43.962
Please, please
give me strength.

01:00:43.964 --> 01:00:46.332
I need your help.

01:00:46.334 --> 01:00:49.405
Amen.

01:01:04.822 --> 01:01:08.324
I'm reading it. No debate.

01:01:08.326 --> 01:01:10.827
I have a right to know
what they're teaching you.

01:01:10.829 --> 01:01:12.696
I don't see why anyone
would read it

01:01:12.698 --> 01:01:14.331
unless you absolutely had to.

01:01:14.333 --> 01:01:17.033
I need to know what's inside.

01:01:17.035 --> 01:01:20.270
There are tons of
spelling errors in it.

01:01:20.272 --> 01:01:23.574
I almost want to mark up
a copy for them.

01:01:23.576 --> 01:01:25.878
But that would take away
the only real enjoyment

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:27.613
you get from reading it,

01:01:27.615 --> 01:01:33.254
'cause I guess it's... actually
not much fun to be there.

01:01:36.123 --> 01:01:37.925
And I'm starting to wonder

01:01:37.927 --> 01:01:40.426
whether it's really
gonna change me.

01:02:01.052 --> 01:02:06.291
"We always come back
to Dog's true design."

01:02:11.897 --> 01:02:14.501
Almighty Dog.

01:02:46.537 --> 01:02:49.005
Welcome to God Versus Science.

01:02:53.210 --> 01:02:55.112
Thank you.

01:02:59.952 --> 01:03:01.619
Look up there...

01:03:01.621 --> 01:03:04.457
Welcome to this exhibit.

01:03:38.062 --> 01:03:40.663
<i>Where are you from, Xavier?</i>

01:03:40.665 --> 01:03:43.198
I was born in Vienna.

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:48.203
I ended up in Canada,
and now I'm here.

01:03:55.915 --> 01:03:57.915
Do you believe in God?

01:03:57.917 --> 01:04:01.420
I do, yeah.

01:04:01.422 --> 01:04:03.755
Wow.

01:04:03.757 --> 01:04:08.195
I question it, but I still
believe in God, yeah.

01:04:15.137 --> 01:04:18.539
Who created the Earth?

01:04:18.541 --> 01:04:20.710
You like a little
small talk, huh?

01:04:22.812 --> 01:04:25.480
Do you believe in the Devil?

01:04:28.986 --> 01:04:31.755
Does he look like me?

01:04:32.924 --> 01:04:34.726
I don't know.

01:04:50.944 --> 01:04:53.511
Do you know Job from the Bible?

01:04:53.513 --> 01:04:56.414
Not personally.

01:04:56.416 --> 01:04:59.785
I hear he's not great company,
always complaining.

01:05:03.759 --> 01:05:05.759
I-I imagine I'm him sometimes.

01:05:05.761 --> 01:05:10.330
And that God and the Devil
are having a bet over me.

01:05:10.332 --> 01:05:12.800
That one day
God will let-let me in

01:05:12.802 --> 01:05:16.807
on the experiment
he was having to test me.

01:05:18.842 --> 01:05:21.544
I think we're our own God.

01:05:23.346 --> 01:05:26.549
I mean, I think he's in us.

01:05:26.551 --> 01:05:33.225
In all of us, not... you know,
somewhere hiding and watching.

01:05:44.871 --> 01:05:47.739
Stay with me.

01:05:47.741 --> 01:05:50.876
Nothing needs to happen.

01:05:50.878 --> 01:05:52.880
I swear.

01:05:55.650 --> 01:05:59.085
I'll prove to you
that God won't strike you down.

01:06:35.862 --> 01:06:38.197
You wronged me, Dad, and I...

01:06:38.199 --> 01:06:41.033
- and I hate the way that...
- Louder, Cameron.

01:06:41.035 --> 01:06:42.534
Can't hear you.

01:06:42.536 --> 01:06:46.038
Come on. I'll bring him closer.
There he is.

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:47.606
You wronged me, Dad,

01:06:47.608 --> 01:06:50.376
and I hate you for the way
that you, that you treated me

01:06:50.378 --> 01:06:52.246
since you found out
about my problems.

01:06:52.248 --> 01:06:55.415
No, about your sin. Say that.

01:06:55.417 --> 01:06:58.652
"About my sins." Go!

01:07:02.559 --> 01:07:05.363
"About my sins."
Come on, Cameron.

01:07:07.497 --> 01:07:12.235
"My homosexual sins."
Come on, Cameron!

01:07:12.237 --> 01:07:14.503
- Cameron!
- I can go.

01:07:14.505 --> 01:07:16.573
- I don't, I don't mind...
- No, no, no, no.

01:07:16.575 --> 01:07:19.242
Jared, everybody gets a turn.
This is Cameron's turn.

01:07:19.244 --> 01:07:21.411
"About my sins!" Come on!

01:07:21.413 --> 01:07:23.613
Found out about my sins.

01:07:23.615 --> 01:07:27.685
I hate that you never listen
to me or acknowledge me.

01:07:27.687 --> 01:07:29.420
And when you do acknowledge me,

01:07:29.422 --> 01:07:31.522
it's to make fun of me
in front of my friends.

01:07:31.524 --> 01:07:33.759
"It's to make fun of me."

01:07:33.761 --> 01:07:35.928
To make fun of me
in front of my friends.

01:07:35.930 --> 01:07:38.665
And that, and that time
that you told me

01:07:38.667 --> 01:07:40.867
that you wished
I'd never been born?

01:07:40.869 --> 01:07:43.438
That really hurt me.

01:07:48.278 --> 01:07:51.046
Cameron...

01:07:51.048 --> 01:07:54.115
now, you say that you're angry,

01:07:54.117 --> 01:07:59.521
but, quite frankly,
I don't really see it.

01:07:59.523 --> 01:08:01.991
Well, what's going on
in there, Cameron?

01:08:01.993 --> 01:08:04.060
Huh?

01:08:04.062 --> 01:08:06.062
Do you want to change?

01:08:06.064 --> 01:08:09.065
Now, you're gonna wish
you hadn't have been born, son,

01:08:09.067 --> 01:08:14.671
because God will not love you
the way that you are right now.

01:08:14.673 --> 01:08:18.009
Unless you really
want to change.

01:08:18.011 --> 01:08:20.680
Well? Come on.

01:08:28.154 --> 01:08:30.022
Well, I guess not.

01:08:30.024 --> 01:08:31.657
I guess not. Okay.

01:08:31.658 --> 01:08:34.827
Let's take a break.

01:08:34.828 --> 01:08:38.332
And you are gonna stay here
until you're ready to go!

01:08:38.334 --> 01:08:42.203
Everybody but Cameron,
take a break.

01:08:45.608 --> 01:08:48.845
I don't care
if you sit there all day, son.

01:09:07.466 --> 01:09:09.466
<i>Is this all a game to you?</i>

01:09:09.469 --> 01:09:11.371
<i>What do you mean?</i>

01:09:12.372 --> 01:09:14.139
Listen, man.

01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:16.207
You got to think about
why you went there.

01:09:16.210 --> 01:09:19.711
You're trying to bail him out?
Seriously?

01:09:19.712 --> 01:09:21.546
And touching him like that?

01:09:21.548 --> 01:09:23.715
Do you think no one saw?

01:09:23.716 --> 01:09:26.653
You saw him.
He was very upset.

01:09:26.654 --> 01:09:29.823
- I didn't mean anything by it.
- I should report you.

01:09:29.825 --> 01:09:32.893
True ownership, man. Okay?

01:09:32.895 --> 01:09:35.996
This is what moral inventory
is all about.

01:09:35.997 --> 01:09:39.600
And you got to quit
staring at me all the time.

01:09:39.602 --> 01:09:42.304
These are the urges
that we got to stamp out.

01:09:42.305 --> 01:09:45.941
Okay? You got to control this.

01:09:45.943 --> 01:09:48.912
- Do you even want this to work?
- Of course I do.

01:09:48.913 --> 01:09:50.846
We're all trying
to make this work.

01:09:50.849 --> 01:09:53.517
I'm having a tough time, too,
just like you are.

01:09:53.519 --> 01:09:55.519
Listen, I'm fine.

01:10:03.263 --> 01:10:05.532
Doesn't seem like it.

01:10:27.656 --> 01:10:29.491
Hey, what are you
doing in here alone?

01:10:29.493 --> 01:10:32.628
You're meant to attend bathroom
breaks with a staff member.

01:10:37.969 --> 01:10:40.638
What?
Now you don't have to pee?

01:10:44.809 --> 01:10:47.012
Or are you gonna do
something solo?

01:10:48.647 --> 01:10:51.151
That's why
they make them rules.

01:10:53.652 --> 01:10:56.320
Not to be trusted.

01:10:56.322 --> 01:10:58.825
Not at this stage of the game.

01:11:02.163 --> 01:11:04.364
Hmm.

01:11:04.366 --> 01:11:07.500
Sounds like Morse code.

01:11:07.502 --> 01:11:10.270
Sending me a message...

01:11:10.272 --> 01:11:12.339
faggot?

01:11:58.659 --> 01:12:01.563
Starting to see it
for what it is?

01:12:07.403 --> 01:12:09.403
Are you okay?

01:12:09.405 --> 01:12:13.475
I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:12:13.477 --> 01:12:16.146
I'm gonna give you some advice.

01:12:19.316 --> 01:12:21.683
Play the part.

01:12:21.685 --> 01:12:24.754
Show 'em it's working.

01:12:24.756 --> 01:12:26.958
You're getting better.

01:12:29.528 --> 01:12:32.929
Fake it until you make it,
right?

01:12:32.931 --> 01:12:34.764
You don't want to end up

01:12:34.766 --> 01:12:38.670
in one of those houses
for any length of time.

01:12:38.672 --> 01:12:41.306
I've heard the stories,
and they're not good.

01:12:41.308 --> 01:12:44.676
And that's where
you're likely gonna end up.

01:12:44.678 --> 01:12:47.279
Sarah's already there.

01:12:47.281 --> 01:12:49.784
So, play the part, man.

01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:53.720
And then, once you're home,

01:12:53.722 --> 01:12:56.456
you got to figure out
what to do next.

01:12:56.458 --> 01:12:58.791
If it comes down to it,

01:12:58.793 --> 01:13:01.795
you may have to walk away
from everything.

01:13:01.797 --> 01:13:04.165
Everyone.

01:13:07.370 --> 01:13:09.971
Thank you for today, Michael.

01:13:09.973 --> 01:13:12.209
- See you tomorrow.
- Mm-hmm.

01:13:17.982 --> 01:13:20.517
You're gonna be
on the podium any day now,

01:13:20.519 --> 01:13:23.988
so you should have a plan.

01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:26.893
Unless you really think
you can change.

01:13:28.695 --> 01:13:30.861
Or even want to.

01:13:37.572 --> 01:13:39.772
<i>I don't want
to be here anymore.</i>

01:13:39.774 --> 01:13:41.940
It's a trial. It...

01:13:41.942 --> 01:13:44.110
- I don't feel good here.
- Nobody feels good

01:13:44.112 --> 01:13:46.346
- about you being there, Jared.
- I-I don't, I don't...

01:13:46.348 --> 01:13:48.382
I'm not sure
if I feel any different.

01:13:48.384 --> 01:13:52.386
Son, son, you're...
you're not even halfway through.

01:13:52.388 --> 01:13:54.855
Why didn't you tell me
how long I might stay for?

01:13:54.857 --> 01:13:56.758
None of us knows
the answer to that, Jared.

01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:57.891
It's kind of up to you.

01:13:57.893 --> 01:13:59.761
You know, you just got to
give it a chance.

01:13:59.763 --> 01:14:01.196
This is like
the book of Matthew.

01:14:01.198 --> 01:14:02.931
The Devil's not gonna
ask you once;

01:14:02.933 --> 01:14:04.767
he's gonna ask you
over and over again, son.

01:14:04.769 --> 01:14:06.268
And you have just got to find

01:14:06.270 --> 01:14:08.870
the strength and commitment
inside you.

01:14:08.872 --> 01:14:12.709
You can get through this, okay?

01:14:12.711 --> 01:14:14.478
Okay?

01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:17.481
- All right.
- It's late. Get some sleep.

01:14:17.483 --> 01:14:20.052
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:14:58.195 --> 01:15:01.931
Jared? You're gonna be late.

01:15:32.801 --> 01:15:34.967
<i>I had thoughts of men.</i>

01:15:34.969 --> 01:15:37.572
Boys at school.

01:15:37.574 --> 01:15:39.809
At college, I...

01:15:41.978 --> 01:15:43.978
My imagination.

01:15:49.353 --> 01:15:51.554
Hey, what's going on?

01:15:51.556 --> 01:15:53.558
I have no idea.

01:15:57.596 --> 01:16:01.067
- Michael, what's going on?
- Just grab a tie.

01:16:06.874 --> 01:16:09.206
Sadly, we are
gathered here today

01:16:09.208 --> 01:16:13.345
to say farewell to our son,

01:16:13.347 --> 01:16:15.113
- our friend and our brother...
- Okay.

01:16:15.115 --> 01:16:17.115
...Cameron Van Heusen,

01:16:17.117 --> 01:16:19.685
who, by his own making
last night,

01:16:19.687 --> 01:16:22.056
fell prey to Satan's wishes.

01:16:23.691 --> 01:16:28.228
Brother Van Heusen, is this
what you want for your son?

01:16:28.230 --> 01:16:30.464
No.

01:16:30.466 --> 01:16:33.868
Young man, is this you?

01:16:33.870 --> 01:16:35.871
Brother Cameron,
is this what you want?

01:16:35.873 --> 01:16:37.373
No.

01:16:37.375 --> 01:16:41.042
Both of you, come on.

01:16:41.044 --> 01:16:44.380
- Bring him down here.
- Let's go.

01:16:44.382 --> 01:16:47.218
- Who's gonna strike this demon down?
- I will.

01:16:50.455 --> 01:16:53.323
Out, you demon! Hit him!

01:16:53.325 --> 01:16:54.959
Get out of him!

01:16:54.961 --> 01:16:56.159
That's it.

01:16:56.161 --> 01:16:58.930
- Out!
- Leave, demon! Leave!

01:17:18.253 --> 01:17:20.421
Ow!

01:18:47.353 --> 01:18:50.690
- Yeah. Wow.
- It wasn't so bad, actually.

01:18:54.729 --> 01:18:56.597
Sarah, come on.

01:19:31.336 --> 01:19:33.573
<i>Stay with me.</i>

01:19:36.844 --> 01:19:40.247
<i>I'll prove to you
that God won't strike you down.</i>

01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:17.222
All right, take your seat.
Welcome back, son.

01:21:18.725 --> 01:21:21.525
Now, I don't know
about y'all, but today,

01:21:21.527 --> 01:21:23.294
whew, I feel invigorated.

01:21:23.296 --> 01:21:26.899
And I feel hopeful
and a true sense

01:21:26.901 --> 01:21:32.371
that anything is possible today
in this room.

01:21:32.373 --> 01:21:36.043
Cameron, how do you feel, son?

01:21:36.045 --> 01:21:38.248
I feel great, sir.

01:21:39.548 --> 01:21:42.382
Do you feel the true presence
of God in your heart?

01:21:42.384 --> 01:21:44.285
Yes, sir.

01:21:44.287 --> 01:21:46.921
And that feels great,
doesn't it?

01:21:46.923 --> 01:21:49.325
Yes, sir, it-it does.

01:21:49.327 --> 01:21:51.229
For sure.

01:21:54.565 --> 01:21:56.565
Happy for you, son.

01:21:58.336 --> 01:22:01.138
Moral inventory.

01:22:04.509 --> 01:22:07.747
Jared, you're up, son.

01:22:10.750 --> 01:22:12.684
Come on.

01:22:12.686 --> 01:22:14.954
Come on, son.

01:22:14.956 --> 01:22:17.024
All right. Michael.

01:22:28.437 --> 01:22:31.705
And when you're ready.

01:22:34.210 --> 01:22:37.880
I had thoughts of men.

01:22:37.882 --> 01:22:41.082
Boys at school.

01:22:41.084 --> 01:22:44.386
On TV, on the street,
in my imagination.

01:22:44.388 --> 01:22:46.389
At college,
I held the hand of a boy,

01:22:46.391 --> 01:22:48.561
and I stayed through the night
in his bed.

01:22:51.897 --> 01:22:53.764
For these thoughts
and this action,

01:22:53.766 --> 01:22:55.432
for which I felt regretful,

01:22:55.434 --> 01:22:58.168
- I'd like to ask for God's...
- Wait. Wait. Hold on.

01:22:58.170 --> 01:23:00.739
Jared.

01:23:00.741 --> 01:23:02.942
Come on.

01:23:02.944 --> 01:23:06.077
What else?

01:23:06.079 --> 01:23:08.313
I never...

01:23:08.315 --> 01:23:10.749
I-I stayed through the night
with the boy from college,

01:23:10.751 --> 01:23:12.319
but we never did anything more.

01:23:12.321 --> 01:23:15.622
Listen, don't even try
lying to God, Jared.

01:23:15.624 --> 01:23:17.657
He already sees.

01:23:17.659 --> 01:23:21.261
So, come on. What else?

01:23:21.263 --> 01:23:23.097
Well...

01:23:23.099 --> 01:23:25.000
I lied on my genogram.

01:23:25.002 --> 01:23:26.534
My uncle Chris
wasn't an alcoholic.

01:23:26.536 --> 01:23:30.173
Why don't you tell us
about this Henry boy?

01:23:31.775 --> 01:23:33.875
That your daddy told me about.

01:23:33.877 --> 01:23:36.446
That's not... that's not fair.

01:23:36.448 --> 01:23:39.782
- Why not?
- That's-that's not my sin.

01:23:39.784 --> 01:23:42.285
Do you want to waste
these people's time?

01:23:42.287 --> 01:23:43.453
I'm not.

01:23:43.455 --> 01:23:45.823
No, these people
who got up here honestly

01:23:45.825 --> 01:23:47.191
and were brave and...

01:23:47.193 --> 01:23:48.292
Well, I could
make something up.

01:23:48.294 --> 01:23:49.293
I could make something up.

01:23:49.295 --> 01:23:50.461
- Is that, is that what you...
- Yeah.

01:23:50.463 --> 01:23:52.697
I-Is that what
you want me to do?

01:23:52.699 --> 01:23:55.033
Isn't-isn't that a-a sin, too?

01:23:55.035 --> 01:23:57.068
I mean,
if-if thoughts are a sin,

01:23:57.070 --> 01:23:58.570
I ask God's forgiveness
for that,

01:23:58.572 --> 01:24:01.409
but I'm not,
I'm not making anything up.

01:24:05.647 --> 01:24:08.149
Okay, then. Okay.

01:24:09.985 --> 01:24:11.487
Lie chair.

01:24:12.656 --> 01:24:16.526
I just want to make use
of some of this anger.

01:24:18.828 --> 01:24:21.262
Uh, wait.
Guys, just... just sit.

01:24:21.264 --> 01:24:23.666
Just stay where you are, okay?

01:24:23.668 --> 01:24:25.434
Here he is, Jared.

01:24:25.436 --> 01:24:27.670
Your father is sitting here,
and I want to,

01:24:27.672 --> 01:24:31.273
I want you to tell him
how affected you are by him

01:24:31.275 --> 01:24:33.910
and how angry you are.

01:24:33.912 --> 01:24:35.445
Tell him how you hate him

01:24:35.447 --> 01:24:37.347
for the things that's he's,
the way he...

01:24:37.349 --> 01:24:39.517
- Sit down. Sit down.
- But I'm not angry.

01:24:39.519 --> 01:24:41.786
- And-and he's done things that upset me, but...
- Yeah, I know.

01:24:41.788 --> 01:24:43.187
But you are. You just...

01:24:43.189 --> 01:24:44.722
- You're angry, but you don't...
- He's let me down,

01:24:44.724 --> 01:24:47.426
but why-why...
why do I have to be angry?

01:24:47.428 --> 01:24:49.394
Just sit.

01:24:49.396 --> 01:24:51.363
- Sit down.
- I'm not a dog!

01:24:51.365 --> 01:24:53.465
- I know.
- And I don't think anyone is responsible for me,

01:24:53.467 --> 01:24:55.034
so I don't see
how it's gonna help

01:24:55.036 --> 01:24:57.070
picking someone
to blame or hate.

01:24:57.072 --> 01:24:58.438
If you don't hate
anyone, Jared,

01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:00.607
then where is all this anger
coming from?

01:25:00.609 --> 01:25:02.042
Because you're
making me angry!

01:25:02.044 --> 01:25:04.278
There you go!
I want you to use that!

01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:06.280
I'm not gonna pretend
I hate my father.

01:25:06.282 --> 01:25:09.084
- I don't hate my father.
- Jared, you do.

01:25:09.086 --> 01:25:11.653
You don't know me!
You're all crazy!

01:25:11.655 --> 01:25:13.221
- Hey! I didn't...
- All of you!

01:25:13.223 --> 01:25:15.057
Just... Jared.

01:25:15.059 --> 01:25:18.094
You're in my chair!
There you go!

01:25:18.096 --> 01:25:20.062
- Jared!
- I hate you!

01:25:20.064 --> 01:25:23.767
- But how does that help?!
- Jared.

01:25:33.579 --> 01:25:34.947
Jared!

01:25:34.949 --> 01:25:38.150
Who's in the front office?

01:25:41.922 --> 01:25:45.459
Jared? Son, let's talk. Son?

01:25:47.696 --> 01:25:50.430
Hey. Michael.

01:25:50.432 --> 01:25:52.799
Hey, hey! Give it to me!

01:25:52.801 --> 01:25:54.601
Michael.

01:25:54.603 --> 01:25:57.537
- I want my things and I want to go.
- Hey, Jared. Michael!

01:25:57.539 --> 01:25:58.605
Hey!

01:25:59.710 --> 01:26:03.178
Hey! Michael!
Get out of the room!

01:26:03.180 --> 01:26:05.381
Come here, son.

01:26:07.316 --> 01:26:10.051
Jared? Hey, hey. Hey, listen.

01:26:10.053 --> 01:26:12.822
What you're having is
a natural response, okay?

01:26:12.824 --> 01:26:14.659
Just-just breathe.

01:26:22.903 --> 01:26:24.169
Jared?

01:26:24.171 --> 01:26:26.204
Hey, I just need a minute!

01:26:26.206 --> 01:26:27.472
Be strong.

01:26:27.474 --> 01:26:29.643
- Just go away.
- Take a minute, okay?

01:26:37.351 --> 01:26:40.352
Please pick up, Mom.

01:26:40.354 --> 01:26:42.088
- Jared?
- Mom.

01:26:42.090 --> 01:26:43.757
- Jared?
- Mom, I need you to...

01:26:43.759 --> 01:26:46.392
- I need you to come get me, please.
- What's the matter?

01:26:46.394 --> 01:26:48.729
- What's the matter? What?
- Please, I'm in trouble.

01:26:48.731 --> 01:26:50.064
What's happened?

01:26:50.066 --> 01:26:51.365
Best thing that we can do is

01:26:51.367 --> 01:26:52.867
probably get these guys
back to a session...

01:26:52.869 --> 01:26:56.771
- Hey, son.
- I called my mom and she's coming to get me.

01:26:56.773 --> 01:26:58.740
Listen, you got to understand

01:26:58.742 --> 01:27:00.742
what you're going through
right now is just a moment.

01:27:00.744 --> 01:27:03.046
- A moment? A moment?
- Okay? And I-I feel exactly

01:27:03.048 --> 01:27:04.848
what you're going through.
I think that you and I

01:27:04.850 --> 01:27:06.683
should just get everybody gone,
we just talk.

01:27:06.685 --> 01:27:08.251
I don't want to talk.
I want to go.

01:27:08.253 --> 01:27:10.855
Well, Jared,
I don't want you to.

01:27:10.857 --> 01:27:12.355
I want you to stay.

01:27:12.357 --> 01:27:14.525
Well, I-I read the rules,

01:27:14.527 --> 01:27:17.027
and none of them say
you can stop me from leaving.

01:27:17.029 --> 01:27:18.896
I wouldn't... Can you just check
where Brandon is, please?

01:27:18.898 --> 01:27:23.368
And if you or anyone puts their
hands on me, I have witnesses.

01:27:23.370 --> 01:27:25.304
Nobody's gonna put
their hands on you.

01:27:25.306 --> 01:27:28.373
Why-why would anybody do that?
Come and sit.

01:27:28.375 --> 01:27:30.877
We're gonna wait
for your mom, okay?

01:27:30.879 --> 01:27:33.646
Jesus, our savior,
please focus on Jared.

01:27:33.648 --> 01:27:36.450
Let him see the strength
and courage that he needs.

01:27:36.452 --> 01:27:38.452
I want you to fill him
right now with

01:27:38.454 --> 01:27:39.786
all the wisdom
of everybody in this room

01:27:39.788 --> 01:27:41.588
to show him
how much they love him

01:27:41.590 --> 01:27:43.224
and how much
they care about him...

01:27:43.226 --> 01:27:45.226
- Be strong!
- ...and his journey into

01:27:45.228 --> 01:27:46.828
the fire that
he's walking into

01:27:46.830 --> 01:27:49.131
- and what he's willing to face.
- You are a man.

01:27:49.133 --> 01:27:51.499
Let him open his eyes to see
the wisdom that you have...

01:27:51.501 --> 01:27:52.902
- Jared!
- Mom!

01:27:52.904 --> 01:27:54.303
Jared, honey,
what's happening?

01:27:54.305 --> 01:27:55.571
- Mom! - What?
- Hey, hey! Sit back down!

01:27:55.573 --> 01:27:56.739
Mom, they're not letting me go!

01:27:56.741 --> 01:27:58.975
It's not that
we're not letting him go.

01:27:58.977 --> 01:28:01.411
- Come on. Open this door.
- Just hold on, okay?

01:28:01.413 --> 01:28:03.647
- Who are you?
- Mrs. Eamons, my name is Victor Sykes.

01:28:03.649 --> 01:28:05.349
We spoke on the telephone.

01:28:05.351 --> 01:28:06.650
I don't remember that.
Open the door.

01:28:06.652 --> 01:28:08.352
- Well, I spoke with your husband a couple times.
- No.

01:28:08.354 --> 01:28:09.586
Jared's just having
a moment here,

01:28:09.588 --> 01:28:10.788
born out of
a role-playing exercise.

01:28:10.790 --> 01:28:12.423
- Now be still. - It's fine.
- No, no!

01:28:12.425 --> 01:28:14.192
That's not true.
Mom, tell him to open the door.

01:28:14.194 --> 01:28:15.827
- You settle down.
- No. Enough. -

01:28:15.829 --> 01:28:17.963
- Open the door now, Mr. Sykes.
- Shut up, okay?

01:28:17.965 --> 01:28:20.933
- Listen, can we just all...
- I said open the door now!

01:28:20.935 --> 01:28:22.969
I'm gonna call the police
if you don't open this door.

01:28:22.971 --> 01:28:25.471
- There is no need for that. Listen, please.
- Jared!

01:28:25.473 --> 01:28:27.941
Let him go!

01:28:27.943 --> 01:28:31.446
- You all right, honey?
- Just let him go.

01:28:34.785 --> 01:28:37.451
I just... I just think that...

01:28:37.453 --> 01:28:40.155
Jared, come on.

01:28:40.157 --> 01:28:43.625
I just... I think
it's more important for his...

01:28:43.627 --> 01:28:45.961
development right now
that he...

01:28:45.963 --> 01:28:47.630
- he would've stayed.
- Don't even listen to him.

01:28:47.632 --> 01:28:49.799
Get in the car.
Get in the car.

01:28:52.237 --> 01:28:53.904
You're gonna ruin that child.

01:28:53.906 --> 01:28:56.974
What are your actual
qualifications, Mr. Sykes?

01:28:56.976 --> 01:28:59.476
I never asked. Hmm?

01:28:59.478 --> 01:29:02.347
Are you a doctor? Are you?
Psychologist?

01:29:02.349 --> 01:29:04.718
I mean, a proper one? Are you?

01:29:06.653 --> 01:29:09.654
No. I didn't think so.

01:29:09.656 --> 01:29:11.826
Oh.

01:29:12.927 --> 01:29:14.361
Shame on you!

01:29:15.563 --> 01:29:17.563
Shame on me, too.

01:29:17.565 --> 01:29:19.835
Shame on you!

01:29:47.199 --> 01:29:48.966
Can I help you?

01:29:48.968 --> 01:29:51.469
Uh, I'm not sure
if I'm staying or going.

01:29:51.471 --> 01:29:53.939
All right.
Well, let me know.

01:30:04.485 --> 01:30:07.253
I talked to your father.

01:30:07.255 --> 01:30:10.391
He wants you to go back.

01:30:16.399 --> 01:30:18.665
I told him
we'll see him at home.

01:30:18.667 --> 01:30:22.405
I told him you're not
going back.

01:30:25.109 --> 01:30:28.110
You know that night...

01:30:28.112 --> 01:30:31.747
when Pastor Wilkes and Jim
came to the house?

01:30:31.749 --> 01:30:36.019
Those men decided what to do
with you, and I just...

01:30:36.021 --> 01:30:40.426
I fell into line,
like I usually do.

01:30:41.993 --> 01:30:44.594
They say sometimes
you got to hurt a child

01:30:44.596 --> 01:30:46.764
in order to help them,
and that may be so

01:30:46.766 --> 01:30:48.699
with some things, but...

01:30:48.701 --> 01:30:52.437
a mother knows
when something isn't right.

01:30:52.439 --> 01:30:56.174
And I knew in my bones...

01:30:56.176 --> 01:30:58.880
this wasn't hurting to help.

01:31:00.682 --> 01:31:05.454
I was just letting you down,
and I kept my mouth shut.

01:31:09.125 --> 01:31:12.626
And I will always regret that.

01:31:14.965 --> 01:31:18.199
But I can do
a different thing now,

01:31:18.201 --> 01:31:20.670
now that I have a chance.

01:31:25.676 --> 01:31:29.146
I'll handle your father.

01:31:29.148 --> 01:31:32.885
He can fall into line with me
for a change.

01:31:38.091 --> 01:31:41.593
<i>Some folk,
they don't go to church</i>

01:31:41.595 --> 01:31:44.063
for the right reasons.

01:31:46.834 --> 01:31:51.006
Now, you know the type
of person I'm talking about.

01:31:53.542 --> 01:31:55.744
They just turn up.

01:31:59.882 --> 01:32:05.186
They don't use every day
of their Christian life...

01:32:05.188 --> 01:32:07.021
to praise the Lord

01:32:07.023 --> 01:32:10.792
and to help bring others
to his word.

01:32:10.794 --> 01:32:13.963
It might be your neighbor,
it might be your friend,

01:32:13.965 --> 01:32:16.698
it might be just a face
you only ever see at church.

01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:19.936
They just turn up.

01:32:19.938 --> 01:32:21.537
I will tell you something
that I know.

01:32:21.539 --> 01:32:25.209
Just turning up to church
does not make you a Christian!

01:32:25.211 --> 01:32:27.711
- Yes, sir.
- Amen.

01:32:27.713 --> 01:32:30.582
Study the Bible.
Study his word.

01:32:30.584 --> 01:32:36.555
I guarantee you,
every question you have...

01:32:36.557 --> 01:32:41.560
you gonna find an answer
in this book.

01:32:41.562 --> 01:32:43.164
- Yes.
- Amen.

01:32:51.441 --> 01:32:53.241
Honey,

01:32:53.243 --> 01:32:58.346
um, do you know a boy,
um, Cameron Van Heusen?

01:32:58.348 --> 01:33:00.983
Yeah. Is he here?

01:33:00.985 --> 01:33:04.286
No. No, no.
That-That's the police.

01:33:04.288 --> 01:33:07.756
Apparently,
this-this boy Cameron

01:33:07.758 --> 01:33:09.960
killed himself last night.

01:33:18.937 --> 01:33:22.775
They want to ask you
some questions.

01:34:32.620 --> 01:34:35.122
Thank you.

01:34:55.279 --> 01:34:56.780
- Hey!
- Hi!

01:34:56.782 --> 01:34:58.949
- How are you?
- Hi. How you doing?

01:34:58.951 --> 01:35:01.218
Yeah. Nice to see you!

01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:02.820
I'm good.

01:35:04.824 --> 01:35:07.392
Yeah, I think
they're in the dishwasher.

01:35:07.394 --> 01:35:09.394
Come on, Chris.

01:35:09.396 --> 01:35:11.096
Join us.

01:35:19.073 --> 01:35:20.906
- Oh!
- Did you call it?

01:35:20.908 --> 01:35:22.141
- I didn't hear you...
- Yes!

01:35:22.143 --> 01:35:23.744
I didn't hear you call it.

01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:31.520
- Mom...
- I gave it to him.

01:36:31.522 --> 01:36:35.492
He has it and he'll read it.
He knows he has to.

01:36:35.494 --> 01:36:37.894
M-Mom, it's important
he reads it.

01:36:37.896 --> 01:36:39.562
Can you just put him on?

01:36:39.564 --> 01:36:42.265
Well... I'm calling you
from Little Rock.

01:36:42.267 --> 01:36:45.435
- I'm with Aunt Mary, so you...
- Wait. Why?

01:36:45.437 --> 01:36:48.038
You should just
call him at home.

01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:50.040
What happened?

01:36:50.042 --> 01:36:52.376
Nothing. She just needed
some help with the shop,

01:36:52.378 --> 01:36:55.680
so I came down here, and I'm
driving back tonight. I'm...

01:36:55.682 --> 01:36:58.885
Nothing. Nothing is wrong.

01:37:27.418 --> 01:37:29.986
<i>Seriously, nothing is wrong.</i>

01:37:29.988 --> 01:37:33.322
<i>Why didn't you tell me
you were coming?</i>

01:37:33.324 --> 01:37:34.892
Is he here?

01:37:34.894 --> 01:37:37.662
He left. It is Sunday.

01:37:37.664 --> 01:37:40.232
If it's urgent, you're
gonna have to go to church.

01:37:41.634 --> 01:37:43.099
Why aren't you there?

01:37:43.101 --> 01:37:45.338
Why aren't you at church?

01:37:47.608 --> 01:37:49.441
I go, sometimes.

01:37:49.443 --> 01:37:52.411
I-I support your dad,
and-and...

01:37:52.413 --> 01:37:55.249
Mom, what's going on
with you two?

01:37:57.184 --> 01:37:59.853
Jared, it's...

01:37:59.855 --> 01:38:01.855
He knows.

01:38:01.857 --> 01:38:04.927
I can't be around the...

01:38:06.996 --> 01:38:09.163
I love God.

01:38:09.165 --> 01:38:11.435
God loves me.

01:38:13.437 --> 01:38:15.705
And I love my son.

01:38:15.707 --> 01:38:17.607
That simple.

01:38:17.609 --> 01:38:23.112
For your father,
it's a little more complicated.

01:38:23.114 --> 01:38:26.016
I wish it wasn't, but it is.

01:39:01.992 --> 01:39:03.825
Did you hear about
the article I've got

01:39:03.827 --> 01:39:06.327
coming out in <i>The Times?</i>

01:39:06.329 --> 01:39:09.097
Do you know what it's about?

01:39:09.099 --> 01:39:12.101
I don't want to get
into a fight.

01:39:12.103 --> 01:39:15.004
- Your mother told me, son.
- It's not a fight.

01:39:15.006 --> 01:39:17.206
I'm just...
doing the right thing.

01:39:17.208 --> 01:39:20.044
I'm letting you know.

01:39:20.046 --> 01:39:22.781
I've written more,
and the publishers are

01:39:22.783 --> 01:39:26.450
talking about me putting
together a whole book.

01:39:26.452 --> 01:39:30.722
You don't need to read
any of it.

01:39:30.724 --> 01:39:32.357
I just needed you to know

01:39:32.359 --> 01:39:34.126
that-that it might
be out there.

01:39:34.128 --> 01:39:37.396
Well... now I know.

01:39:37.398 --> 01:39:40.433
But it might be good
for you to read.

01:39:40.435 --> 01:39:45.304
Because you never really asked
what went on there.

01:39:45.306 --> 01:39:48.576
You never really knew
the staff or...

01:39:48.578 --> 01:39:51.211
- or...
- You're right. You're right.

01:39:51.213 --> 01:39:54.382
When the situation came up,

01:39:54.384 --> 01:39:58.220
I did what I've often done
in my life.

01:39:58.222 --> 01:40:01.824
I sought the counsel
of wiser men,

01:40:01.826 --> 01:40:04.293
and I followed their advice.

01:40:04.295 --> 01:40:06.896
What would you do now?

01:40:06.898 --> 01:40:08.898
Now that you're running things.

01:40:08.900 --> 01:40:10.803
Enough.

01:40:14.173 --> 01:40:16.576
Good night.

01:40:45.608 --> 01:40:48.278
For me.

01:41:38.367 --> 01:41:40.401
Is there something
you need help with?

01:41:40.403 --> 01:41:42.771
'Cause, you know,
I got to make my flight.

01:41:42.773 --> 01:41:45.340
Yeah, now, this was
gonna be for Christmas,

01:41:45.342 --> 01:41:47.944
but, uh, well, you know,
your mother tells me

01:41:47.946 --> 01:41:50.012
you like to drive upstate
sometimes to write.

01:41:50.014 --> 01:41:52.684
Dad, I live in New York;
I don't need a car.

01:41:53.685 --> 01:41:55.853
She also tells me...

01:41:55.855 --> 01:41:59.290
you like to write by hand
before you use your computer.

01:41:59.292 --> 01:42:01.393
Just like me.

01:42:02.696 --> 01:42:04.229
This pen...

01:42:04.231 --> 01:42:08.635
is made from a cedar tree
grown in Israel.

01:42:10.071 --> 01:42:11.871
Guided me.

01:42:11.873 --> 01:42:14.540
I've written every sermon
that I've ever delivered

01:42:14.542 --> 01:42:17.645
in this new church
with this pen.

01:42:21.083 --> 01:42:23.485
One writer to another.

01:42:35.066 --> 01:42:37.635
I don't want
to pretend anymore.

01:42:39.436 --> 01:42:41.436
We don't need
to spend time together.

01:42:41.438 --> 01:42:43.273
We don't need to speak

01:42:43.275 --> 01:42:46.343
unless we're gonna talk
to each other properly.

01:42:46.345 --> 01:42:50.080
Like... you-you've done
some things

01:42:50.082 --> 01:42:52.917
that have really hurt me.

01:42:52.919 --> 01:42:55.586
Like-like you never,
you never asked

01:42:55.588 --> 01:42:58.326
if there was more
to my story at college.

01:43:00.128 --> 01:43:03.362
You never asked if I was okay.

01:43:03.364 --> 01:43:06.868
You were too focused
on how it affected you.

01:43:10.105 --> 01:43:15.175
There are so many things
that we've never spoken about.

01:43:15.177 --> 01:43:18.212
And I don't know
if we ever will.

01:43:18.214 --> 01:43:20.015
Yeah.

01:43:25.957 --> 01:43:29.124
You know, all this
was gonna be yours.

01:43:29.126 --> 01:43:32.460
I-I mean, it still will be,
but I meant to run and to...

01:43:32.462 --> 01:43:34.833
make a living from.

01:43:38.371 --> 01:43:40.971
I understand.

01:43:40.973 --> 01:43:43.343
We all got our own paths.

01:43:44.743 --> 01:43:49.547
The truth is
I want you to do well.

01:43:49.549 --> 01:43:52.317
I want you to have
a great life.

01:43:52.319 --> 01:43:53.988
I love you.

01:43:55.689 --> 01:43:58.825
But I can't pretend, either.

01:43:58.827 --> 01:44:01.428
There are things
I disagree with.

01:44:01.430 --> 01:44:03.663
And I'll admit,
I'm gonna be honest,

01:44:03.665 --> 01:44:06.333
I'm, you know...
I am being prideful

01:44:06.335 --> 01:44:09.569
when I resent the fact that
I may never be a grandparent.

01:44:09.571 --> 01:44:11.538
Now, that's just the truth.

01:44:11.540 --> 01:44:14.878
It's hard for me to admit
that I have hurt you.

01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:20.081
And that with my beliefs
and with all that's gone on,

01:44:20.083 --> 01:44:24.454
I understand I-I may have
set myself up to lose you.

01:44:24.456 --> 01:44:28.425
And I've had to ask myself,
and God,

01:44:28.427 --> 01:44:30.628
if I'm ready for that.

01:44:38.071 --> 01:44:42.474
I do not want to lose you.

01:44:42.476 --> 01:44:44.542
Well, it doesn't feel like that.

01:44:44.544 --> 01:44:46.545
I'm sick of avoiding you.

01:44:46.547 --> 01:44:48.881
I'm sick of talking
about nothing.

01:44:48.883 --> 01:44:51.418
I'm sick of it.

01:44:51.420 --> 01:44:54.720
I'm gay, and I'm your son.

01:44:54.722 --> 01:44:57.825
And neither of those things
are going to change.

01:44:57.827 --> 01:45:00.061
Okay? So let's deal with that.

01:45:00.063 --> 01:45:01.896
Or let's call it a day.

01:45:01.898 --> 01:45:07.103
Both of us would be okay,
but that would be a shame.

01:45:10.574 --> 01:45:15.078
I'm not changing.
There's no changing me.

01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:17.180
God knows I tried.

01:45:17.182 --> 01:45:21.619
So if you mean it...
if you really mean that...

01:45:23.589 --> 01:45:28.292
...and you're not ready
to lose me...

01:45:28.294 --> 01:45:29.793
then I'm sorry,

01:45:29.795 --> 01:45:34.032
but you're gonna have to be
the one to change.

01:45:34.034 --> 01:45:36.037
I understand.

01:45:39.006 --> 01:45:41.008
I am gonna try.

01:45:46.549 --> 01:45:48.784
I'll try.

01:45:50.453 --> 01:45:52.654
I got to get going.

01:46:18.151 --> 01:46:19.916
Dad...

01:46:19.918 --> 01:46:23.188
I've invited Mom
to my place for Christmas.

01:46:23.190 --> 01:46:25.423
Yeah.

01:46:25.425 --> 01:46:28.495
You're welcome to come, too.
