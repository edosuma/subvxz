16:58.017 --> 16:59.583
Okay.

17:03.500 --> 17:06.808
The Queen says that there
is someone who can help us.

17:06.851 --> 17:09.811
In this time,
here in Los Angeles.

17:09.854 --> 17:12.553
She called this individual
a watcher.

17:12.596 --> 17:15.034
You're saying if we find them,
we can undo this nightmare of--

17:15.077 --> 17:18.602
what'd they call it--
the-the Confederation?

17:18.646 --> 17:21.257
-Will it bring Elnor back?
-It's impossible to determine

17:21.301 --> 17:23.999
whether we're existing outside
a temporal causality loop.

17:24.043 --> 17:26.045
Jurati.

17:26.088 --> 17:28.830
We fix time...

17:28.873 --> 17:31.441
does it bring Elnor back?

17:33.443 --> 17:35.619
I... I don't know.

17:35.663 --> 17:38.622
Well, I'm going with
it brings him back,

17:38.666 --> 17:41.538
and I'm not waiting around
for that thing.

17:42.496 --> 17:45.238
If the watcher is our only lead,

17:45.281 --> 17:47.370
then it's probably
some alien species

17:47.414 --> 17:50.765
that doesn't belong here,
using tech,

17:50.808 --> 17:52.636
probably leaving
a subspace signal, meaning...

17:52.680 --> 17:55.857
-We can track it.
-It may not want to be found.

17:55.900 --> 17:57.685
You know,
I don't really care much.

17:57.728 --> 17:59.426
I'm coming for it.

18:03.473 --> 18:05.823
She's too emotional.

18:05.867 --> 18:08.739
-Too much could go wrong.
-I'll go with her.

18:08.783 --> 18:10.872
Me too.

18:10.915 --> 18:12.308
You can't bring that with you.

18:12.352 --> 18:14.310
-This?
-Yeah.

18:14.354 --> 18:16.182
-Why not?
-Because we're 400 years
in the past.

18:16.225 --> 18:17.661
You have to look out
for butterflies.

18:17.705 --> 18:19.272
If you lose that,

around his mittens.

18:24.625 --> 18:25.930
Please. But the point is...

18:25.974 --> 18:28.672
-No phasers.
-It goes beyond phasers.

18:28.716 --> 18:30.805
Don't draw attention
to yourself.

18:30.848 --> 18:32.633
No hospitals. No authorities.

18:32.676 --> 18:34.417
No security checkpoints.

18:34.461 --> 18:37.464
Anything that can scan you--
it can find the ID implants

18:37.507 --> 18:39.814
and vaccination chips from
a future that doesn't exist yet.

18:39.857 --> 18:41.598
I understand.

18:42.904 --> 18:44.253
Admiral?

18:44.297 --> 18:46.168
While you search,

18:46.212 --> 18:50.129
Dr. Jurati and I will try
and revive the Borg Queen.

18:51.478 --> 18:54.872
Are you certain
you want to do that?

18:54.916 --> 18:57.788
She is the only one
who can tell us

18:57.832 --> 19:00.574
why we need the watcher

19:00.617 --> 19:03.229
and perhaps give us a location.

19:03.272 --> 19:06.101
RIOS:
S-So, to be clear...

19:06.145 --> 19:08.234
wake a queen
that could kill us all,

19:08.277 --> 19:11.062
beam from a ship with no power,
and find a watcher

19:11.106 --> 19:13.674
who may or may not exist.

19:15.502 --> 19:17.808
That's it, Rios.

19:19.462 --> 19:20.594
Let's go to work.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.167
Yes, sir.

19:35.957 --> 19:38.525
She's still in there somewhere.

19:38.568 --> 19:40.831
No activity in her reticular
activating system,

19:40.875 --> 19:43.878
but this is
her communication center.

19:43.921 --> 19:46.446
Looks like she's trying to talk
but can't wake up to speak.

19:47.403 --> 19:50.101
When I was Locutus,

19:50.145 --> 19:53.104
when I was a member of the Borg,

19:53.148 --> 19:55.977
they rarely spoke audibly.

19:56.020 --> 19:59.415
But a thought
would be shared instantly

19:59.459 --> 20:01.069
with every Borg.

20:01.112 --> 20:03.550
-Perhaps...
-She is talking.

20:03.593 --> 20:06.857
But nobody can hear
because she's not connected.

20:07.815 --> 20:12.298
I might be able to draw power
from environmental controls,

20:12.341 --> 20:13.995
use the ship as an interface.

20:14.038 --> 20:15.736
Repair her enough
to get her out of

20:15.779 --> 20:17.781
this recovery mode
she's locked in.

20:17.825 --> 20:19.783
This should have accessed her
central core system--

20:19.827 --> 20:22.351
her-her self, I guess--
but I can't get in.

20:22.395 --> 20:25.876
Did you have access when
you were part of the collective?

20:25.920 --> 20:27.182
Yes.

20:27.226 --> 20:31.665
I felt an intense euphoria

20:31.708 --> 20:34.363
but no sense of my existence,

20:34.407 --> 20:37.540
-just her.
-So, in theory, as Locutus,

20:37.584 --> 20:39.281
you could fix her
from the inside.

20:39.325 --> 20:41.588
No. She knows my mind.

20:41.631 --> 20:44.808
Total assimilation can
take hours for a newcomer,

20:44.852 --> 20:48.203
but me, she'd take in seconds.

20:48.247 --> 20:51.032
-But not me.
-Absolutely not.

20:51.075 --> 20:53.208
She doesn't know me, and she's
only operating at eight percent.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.689
How euphoric
can eight percent be?

20:55.732 --> 20:57.517
I-I just need to get
in there, fix her,

20:57.560 --> 20:59.649
and you pull me out
before I'm fully assimilated.

20:59.693 --> 21:03.262
I would be able to restore power
to the ship and restore her.

21:03.305 --> 21:05.133
Look, you said it yourself,

21:05.176 --> 21:07.788
we need her to know
what we have to do here.

21:07.831 --> 21:09.877

-MAN: Open the door!

42:15.489 --> 42:18.144
It's a simple exchange, Locutus.

42:18.187 --> 42:19.928
Give me this ship
and I will give you

42:19.972 --> 42:21.756
the location of the watcher--

42:21.800 --> 42:25.107
the only one here who can help
you find the change in time.

42:25.151 --> 42:26.587
No.

42:26.631 --> 42:29.329
I'm not going
to negotiate with you.

42:29.372 --> 42:31.157
So you would sacrifice

42:31.200 --> 42:34.639
the future of countless others
for your own?

42:34.682 --> 42:35.901
-[sighs]
-JURATI: Picard?

42:37.076 --> 42:39.861
Doctor, are you all right?

42:39.905 --> 42:41.384
Your plan worked.

42:41.428 --> 42:45.345
Power has been restored,
along with the Queen.

42:45.388 --> 42:46.564
However...

42:46.607 --> 42:49.349
same leopard, same spots.

42:50.393 --> 42:52.265
No need to keep her
activated, then.

42:52.308 --> 42:54.267
-Agreed.
-[scoffs]

42:54.310 --> 42:56.878
Idle human threats.

42:56.922 --> 42:59.272
You won't deactivate me because
of your deeply flawed inability

42:59.315 --> 43:01.361
not to hope
in the face of hopelessness.

43:01.404 --> 43:03.581
I hold information you need.

43:03.624 --> 43:06.496
You, against all odds,
hope I'll relent.

43:06.540 --> 43:08.324
Therefore,
you won't deactivate me.

43:08.368 --> 43:10.500
And with each passing second,
the mathematical probability

43:10.544 --> 43:13.025
that I get your ship grows.

43:13.068 --> 43:14.853
In the end,
you'll sacrifice your lives

43:14.896 --> 43:16.202
for the future of the many.

43:16.245 --> 43:17.899
So, in the interest
of efficiency,

43:17.943 --> 43:20.685
shall we just fast forward?

43:20.728 --> 43:23.601
What exactly
is the information you hold?

43:23.644 --> 43:25.907
The location of the watcher

43:25.951 --> 43:28.127
and when the temporal
divergence occurs.

43:28.170 --> 43:30.042
Hmm.

43:31.826 --> 43:33.741
Are you sure about that?

43:39.399 --> 43:40.443
What did you do?

43:40.487 --> 43:42.707
Where is it?

43:42.750 --> 43:44.447
You...

43:44.491 --> 43:45.666
Stole it.

43:45.710 --> 43:47.668
Computer, dictate
the file logged

43:47.712 --> 43:49.365
"Shit I stole
from the Borg Queen."

43:49.409 --> 43:53.413
COMPUTER:
3-4-dot-0-4-8-8 North

43:53.456 --> 43:56.329
-No one takes from me, my dear.
-1-1-8-dot-2-5

43:56.372 --> 43:58.418
-1-8 West.
-Coordinates.

43:58.461 --> 44:00.115
To find the watcher.

44:00.159 --> 44:01.334
Ah, well done.

44:01.377 --> 44:02.901
I suppose even higher,

44:02.944 --> 44:05.207
cybernetic lifeforms
can get sloppy

44:05.251 --> 44:07.688
with where they leave
secrets lying around.

44:07.732 --> 44:10.604
But there's more, isn't there?

44:10.648 --> 44:12.954
When it happens.

44:12.998 --> 44:15.565
I can alm...
I can almost feel it.

44:15.609 --> 44:17.698
[Jurati chuckles]

44:17.742 --> 44:19.569
It'll come to me.

44:19.613 --> 44:23.269
What you have just done here
is more difficult

44:23.312 --> 44:25.358
and vastly more dangerous

44:25.401 --> 44:27.752
than you realize.

44:27.795 --> 44:29.841
And what is that?

44:29.884 --> 44:32.626
You've impressed me.

44:37.022 --> 44:39.981
Come.
I think you should be

44:40.025 --> 44:42.549
-as far away from her
as possible.
-She knows more.

44:42.592 --> 44:44.638
Yeah, in due time.

44:50.122 --> 44:53.299
MAN:
Federal officers! Open up!

44:54.735 --> 44:57.477
-[banging on door]
-MAN: Open up!
I'm not asking again!

44:59.435 --> 45:02.700
What do you think you're doing
breaking my door like that?

45:02.743 --> 45:04.179
Miss, you need to calm down.

45:04.223 --> 45:06.225
TERESA: It's "doctor."
State your business.

45:06.268 --> 45:07.443
-Damn butterflies.
-OFFICER: We're here
to search the premises...

45:12.448 --> 45:15.234
TERESA:
Or have you guys
just given up on that?

45:15.277 --> 45:17.366
-Are you the owner
of this establishment?
-Yes.

45:17.410 --> 45:19.760
I'm also a U.S. citizen
who knows her rights.

45:19.804 --> 45:21.980
Hey, Doc. The patients
have been discharged,

45:22.023 --> 45:24.373
but I got a-a bleeder that needs
your help back here, ASAP.

45:27.159 --> 45:29.552
Look, you guys
want to trash the place,

45:29.596 --> 45:31.424
go ahead,
but I've got a 13-year-old

45:31.467 --> 45:33.295
with a compound fracture.
I'm trying to save his leg.

45:33.339 --> 45:35.080
-So, Doc, come on. Let's go.
-Hold it!

45:36.081 --> 45:37.778
That looks awfully new.

45:37.822 --> 45:39.780
Like what you'd get
if you were a patient.

45:39.824 --> 45:42.043
ID. Now.

45:44.393 --> 45:46.613
I'm-I'm sorry, are-are you
my boss or something?

45:46.656 --> 45:48.267
I feel like I missed
something here.

45:48.310 --> 45:49.572
-[groans]
-Hey!

45:49.616 --> 45:50.922
You're under arrest.

45:50.965 --> 45:53.751
Obstruction of justice.
Both of you.

45:54.577 --> 45:56.797
I don't know
if you're brave or stupid.

45:56.841 --> 45:58.625
OFFICER:
Let me guess.

45:58.668 --> 46:00.279
No UHC card, no ID.

46:00.322 --> 46:01.889
I'm gonna go with stupid.

46:01.933 --> 46:03.978
-[groans]
-Let's take 'em in.

46:05.850 --> 46:07.852
[combadge chirps]

46:07.895 --> 46:10.115
PICARD: Rios, come in.

46:10.158 --> 46:11.638
Are you there?

46:11.681 --> 46:14.467
Rios, do you read me?

46:14.510 --> 46:15.598
Rios!
