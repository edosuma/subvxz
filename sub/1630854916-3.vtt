03:28.280 --> 03:30.040
I need your help with something.

03:30.040 --> 03:32.080
What kind of something?

03:32.080 --> 03:33.320
My gun.

03:34.400 --> 03:36.120
Absolutely not.

03:37.320 --> 03:38.720
Keep your voice down.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.440
It would be breaking all the rules.

03:41.440 --> 03:43.080
I don't care, give me my gun.

03:44.040 --> 03:48.160
Well, can you at least tell
me why you think you need it?

03:48.160 --> 03:50.080
You remember why I came here, right?

03:50.840 --> 03:53.280
You were looking for the
owner of a tobacco case.

03:53.280 --> 03:56.000
Seven years ago,
someone killed my family.

03:58.680 --> 04:02.680
That tobacco case is the only clue
I have, and it brought me here.

04:02.680 --> 04:05.480
Oh, Django. I'm so sorry.

04:05.480 --> 04:07.440
Nah, don't be sorry, don't be sorry.

04:07.440 --> 04:10.240
Look at me, don't be
sorry. Just give me my gun.

04:11.320 --> 04:14.320
We will accompany John
to Nacogdoches today,

04:14.320 --> 04:15.880
and I want to be armed.

04:15.880 --> 04:16.920
Will you promise me...

04:16.920 --> 04:19.280
I just wanna talk to him,
I'm sure he knows something.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.920
Do you trust me?

04:41.600 --> 04:43.800
Why didn't you marry him?

04:43.800 --> 04:45.280
Get off me!

04:46.920 --> 04:48.680
You scared of him?

04:48.840 --> 04:51.640
I'm not scared... of anyone.

04:52.240 --> 04:55.840
He could've got you killed
in Elmdale. I'd never do that.

04:56.760 --> 05:00.280
And you know it. Because I know you.

05:05.120 --> 05:08.480
You think you know me, but you don't.

05:10.480 --> 05:11.960
You don't know anything.

05:58.120 --> 06:00.280
What are you thinking?

06:00.280 --> 06:04.960
You know what I'm thinking is:
if we want to get the oil out,

06:04.960 --> 06:06.800
we gotta get us a drill.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.720
Now, we will pass through
Elizabeth's territory

06:09.720 --> 06:12.320
and that stranger's gonna come
in handy if we get attacked.

06:12.320 --> 06:13.840
You're trusting a thief.

06:15.240 --> 06:16.680
I wanna go with you.

06:17.400 --> 06:19.160
I'll bring Kevin and Phillip.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.720
- John...
- He is not armed, don't worry.

06:22.720 --> 06:24.440
I curse that man for the robbery.

06:24.440 --> 06:27.120
He gave the Lady another
reason to want us dead.

06:29.720 --> 06:32.960
Everything will be fine. You'll see.

06:38.360 --> 06:40.040
Hey...

07:01.200 --> 07:02.960
Thank you, ma'am.

07:21.440 --> 07:24.160
I've always taken
care of you, haven't I?

07:24.760 --> 07:26.240
Yes, ma'am.

07:27.800 --> 07:29.480
And I always will.

07:34.320 --> 07:38.160
When I taught you to
read, what did I say?

07:40.200 --> 07:42.440
That I'm Adam's eyes.

07:42.440 --> 07:44.040
Yes.

07:44.040 --> 07:45.720
That's right.

07:52.280 --> 07:54.000
Now...

07:54.400 --> 07:58.080
Now I need you to be my eyes and ears...

08:02.600 --> 08:04.040
Mh-hm.

08:07.280 --> 08:08.840
I'm sorry.

08:09.520 --> 08:13.160
Now, we need to make you credible.

08:16.760 --> 08:18.080
I'm sure you understand.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.360
Let's go.

08:48.880 --> 08:55.640
Lady's Plantation

09:25.480 --> 09:26.600
John.

09:28.240 --> 09:30.840
I can't watch my son die of hunger.

09:32.800 --> 09:34.600
Oh, I'll take my chances.

10:02.320 --> 10:05.480
The Lady hates us. It's
getting worse every day.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.960
She had a man killed just
'cause she thought that he helped

10:07.960 --> 10:09.520
that robbery in town.

10:11.080 --> 10:15.200
That's when I knew I had to go.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.440
- Eat this.
- Thanks.

10:25.440 --> 10:27.360
You'll need your strength.

10:27.360 --> 10:30.160
Don't send me back, please.

10:30.160 --> 10:32.440
Ain't up to me, John and
Sarah decide who stays,

10:32.440 --> 10:34.680
but they're not here now.

10:34.680 --> 10:36.240
And where are they then?

10:36.240 --> 10:39.040
They went up to Nacogdoches
a couple of days.

11:04.760 --> 11:07.720
You know it's a funny thing,

11:07.720 --> 11:10.760
you can't dig a grave
without ending up inside one.

11:12.440 --> 11:16.320
I buried Sarah's entire
family after the war.

11:23.800 --> 11:25.480
Did you kill 'em?

11:29.600 --> 11:31.160
Did you?

11:49.320 --> 11:50.960
Do you know who did?

11:50.960 --> 11:52.480
No, I was too late.

11:55.480 --> 11:57.400
Sarah was the only one left.

12:01.040 --> 12:03.200
She didn't say a thing at first.

12:04.480 --> 12:07.840
Not a damn thing, like she was mute.

12:07.840 --> 12:09.600
And when she did speak...

12:12.720 --> 12:14.520
...she damn near ripped my heart out.

12:17.800 --> 12:19.160
What'd she say?

12:26.160 --> 12:29.720
She said the blood of her
family was on her father's hands.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.280
You believe that?

12:43.480 --> 12:47.680
It's a harsh thing to
say. Do you need a hand?

12:49.160 --> 12:50.760
No, I'm good.

12:55.880 --> 12:57.160
Goodnight.

13:00.960 --> 13:02.400
Goodnight, stranger.

13:25.800 --> 13:28.400
This is the first time
I've ever done a robbery.

13:29.480 --> 13:31.600
We do it for our families.

13:32.440 --> 13:35.320
If we make it home alive, I
wanna try for another baby.

13:37.320 --> 13:38.960
What's it like being a father?

13:39.680 --> 13:41.560
It changes everything.

13:44.160 --> 13:45.960
You know, my father was a good man.

13:45.960 --> 13:48.400
That's what Maggie
says too. She loved him.

13:50.440 --> 13:52.440
Yeah. I wish I'd met him.

13:52.440 --> 13:56.600
Yeah. Uh, we were... we were poor.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.600
Even, uh...

13:58.600 --> 14:00.520
...even poorer than we are now.

14:00.520 --> 14:03.560
- That's hard to imagine.
- Yeah.

14:08.040 --> 14:11.120
What about you? Are
you your father's son?

14:20.120 --> 14:25.320
My father was a drunk.
A real heavy drinker.

14:29.200 --> 14:31.280
He would beat my mother up.

14:33.600 --> 14:37.160
He would beat me up, if
he had a real rough night.

14:40.800 --> 14:45.000
I remember his... his bloody knuckles.

14:48.200 --> 14:53.400
And when my mother died, he'd beat
me twice as much and twice as hard.

14:55.600 --> 15:00.760
Up until the point I started hoping
I... I wouldn't wake up from it.

15:04.480 --> 15:08.800
And when I was thirteen, I
found one of my mother's dresses.

15:11.400 --> 15:13.360
And I smelled it.

15:14.720 --> 15:17.120
It still smelled like her.

15:23.080 --> 15:25.120
So I buried my face in it,

15:28.840 --> 15:30.800
and after that,

15:30.800 --> 15:33.040
I put it on.

15:33.920 --> 15:35.800
And that's how he found me.

15:36.720 --> 15:42.000
Imagine. I was wearing
my mother's dress.

15:43.360 --> 15:45.320
And he just stared at me.

15:46.600 --> 15:49.400
And he kept staring, didn't say a word.

15:50.640 --> 15:53.680
And then all of a sudden he
said, "Put that shit off."

16:05.840 --> 16:07.480
Keep running.

16:09.360 --> 16:10.440
Hurry up.

16:10.440 --> 16:12.720
We're almost there.

16:12.720 --> 16:14.760
Come on, hurry. Run!

16:14.760 --> 16:17.400
I don't see 'em anymore. I
don't... I don't see 'em anymore.

16:17.400 --> 16:18.960
I don't see 'em.

16:20.400 --> 16:22.360
Come on.

16:26.440 --> 16:28.040
We lost them.

16:28.040 --> 16:30.000
- How do you know?
- I don't.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.720
- We hit the jackpot.
- Shh! Shh! Shh!

16:36.360 --> 16:39.120
I think we made it, we made it.

16:39.120 --> 16:40.520
We made it!

16:42.640 --> 16:45.400
Look at all this money... look how much!

16:46.640 --> 16:48.600
Smell it. Smell it!

17:35.120 --> 17:36.920
Did something happen?

17:36.920 --> 17:39.600
Nothing. I just wanted to be with you.

17:40.680 --> 17:42.600
I don't want to leave
you alone with him.

17:47.880 --> 17:49.960
Why you here, son?

17:49.960 --> 17:51.680
Couldn't let her travel alone.

17:52.920 --> 17:54.600
It's not safe out here.

18:32.840 --> 18:34.920
Elijah, get up!

18:37.120 --> 18:38.680
Shit! Fuck!

19:04.840 --> 19:05.920
Ah!

19:09.160 --> 19:10.880
Uh!

19:31.720 --> 19:33.160
Ah!

19:40.720 --> 19:43.600
Go! Let's go!

20:10.200 --> 20:12.240
So, this is John's plan?

20:12.240 --> 20:16.120
These thieves believe they
can get rich off my land.

20:16.120 --> 20:18.680
They do not know what awaits them.

20:21.240 --> 20:25.120
Open that book and read
where the red sign is.

20:29.480 --> 20:33.800
Read about syphilis,
read out loud, please.

20:33.800 --> 20:38.240
A venereal disease
contracted chiefly by...

20:38.240 --> 20:40.360
...infection during sexual intercourse,

20:40.360 --> 20:43.160
and transmitted dur... during pregnancy,

20:43.160 --> 20:47.920
provoking miscarriage,
general or partial paresis,

20:47.920 --> 20:50.800
blindness or tabes dorsalis.

20:56.400 --> 20:59.240
Now you see what we're fighting against.

20:59.600 --> 21:02.600
We don't want others to suffer
like Adam is suffering, right?

21:02.600 --> 21:04.280
No, ma'am.

21:04.280 --> 21:07.880
That's why we need to
destroy that city of sin.

21:09.640 --> 21:13.240
And when it's done, I'm
gonna send you up north

21:14.200 --> 21:17.160
so you can study medicine
and become a doctor.

21:18.440 --> 21:20.440
Are... Are you kidding?

21:21.120 --> 21:23.480
Never been more serious
in my entire life.

21:25.400 --> 21:28.280
- Now, would you like some bacon?
- Yes, ma'am.

21:29.440 --> 21:32.320
But, uh... why are
you doing that for me?

21:32.320 --> 21:38.360
'Cause I can see perfectly clear how
that diabolical disease that my...

21:38.360 --> 21:42.200
...filthy pig of a husband
contaminated my son with will...

21:42.200 --> 21:44.520
..slowly destroy him.

21:45.240 --> 21:47.160
And I won't be here forever.

21:48.000 --> 21:52.200
And if you're a doctor, you can
take care of Adam when I'm gone.

21:53.960 --> 21:55.400
Now...

21:55.400 --> 21:59.960
I need you to promise me that you
will take care of him when I'm gone.

22:04.080 --> 22:05.440
I promise.

22:06.720 --> 22:11.720
"I promise... to take care
of Adam when you're gone".

22:11.720 --> 22:15.200
I promise to take care
of Adam when you're gone.

22:16.760 --> 22:18.000
That's nice.

22:21.080 --> 22:22.600
Now you can eat.

23:00.160 --> 23:01.920
John!

23:03.680 --> 23:08.520
My God, feels like it was
yesterday the last time I saw you.

23:08.520 --> 23:10.680
Come here.

23:14.880 --> 23:18.000
Well, then I look in the mirror
and see some shriveled old goat.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.720
Been a lot longer than I care to admit.

23:19.720 --> 23:22.760
Allow me the pleasure of
introducing Oscar Beaunney.

23:23.960 --> 23:27.320
If I hadn't met him, I wouldn't
have survived after the war.

23:27.320 --> 23:31.200
It's the same for me. Walter's
the brother I never had.

23:31.200 --> 23:34.600
Now, we're here to offer you a deal.

23:36.680 --> 23:38.240
A deal?

23:38.240 --> 23:41.560
Why don't you come inside, I'll
do you a deal on a cup of coffee.

23:41.560 --> 23:45.400
- Liking the sound of that.
- Come on. Come on y'all.

23:50.120 --> 23:54.920
Now let me introduce you to
my family. This is Ki-Mama.

23:54.920 --> 23:57.120
Welcome. Would you like some coffee?

23:57.120 --> 23:58.520
Coffee would be good.

23:58.520 --> 23:59.840
Thank you.

24:01.080 --> 24:02.880
She was my nanny.

24:02.880 --> 24:05.200
I lost my mother when I was six,

24:05.480 --> 24:08.680
she's been my only family ever since.

24:08.680 --> 24:12.160
We ain't blood, clearly,
but blood doesn't matter.

24:17.600 --> 24:22.120
Excuse me, sir. Is there
a-anywhere I can wash up?

24:22.120 --> 24:24.120
Sure, it's right upstairs.

24:24.120 --> 24:25.440
Thank you.

24:30.880 --> 24:35.240
I'll pay a fair price for
it, already got financing.

24:35.240 --> 24:37.440
I'm sorry, the rig's not for sale.

24:38.160 --> 24:42.120
What kinda price are we talkin' about?

24:48.640 --> 24:50.120
Two thousand.

27:15.400 --> 27:18.840
You could spend the next 100
years looking for a deeper reserve.

27:20.800 --> 27:22.760
Or you could cash out right now.

27:24.120 --> 27:29.040
With all due respect, Mr. Ellis,
I don't believe you're an expert

27:29.040 --> 27:31.000
on the geology of this place.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.520
A bunch of men with masks and
guns are on their way here.

27:34.080 --> 27:37.920
Shit! Seymour, take the money
upstairs and give the gun to Django.

27:37.920 --> 27:39.560
It's the Lady's men.

27:39.560 --> 27:41.240
They followed us.

27:41.240 --> 27:42.880
Let's go down to the basement.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.720
Seymour! You got some ammo?

29:43.720 --> 29:44.960
I'm out!

29:44.960 --> 29:46.080
Shit!

29:59.800 --> 30:01.280
Ah.

30:34.280 --> 30:37.040
Fuck!

30:49.440 --> 30:53.560
You found me when I was
drowning. You showed me...

30:54.360 --> 30:56.560
...your lovely, terrible face.

30:59.720 --> 31:02.600
In the flickering light of grace,

31:02.600 --> 31:04.720
I heard you say,

31:06.640 --> 31:09.440
"Why have you turned
your back on my love?

31:10.920 --> 31:15.600
"Why have you chosen him instead of me?"

31:21.040 --> 31:23.840
On the night of his passion,

31:25.320 --> 31:28.360
while dining with his disciples,

31:28.360 --> 31:31.680
he broke bread and gave it to
them and said, "Take this bread

31:32.600 --> 31:38.440
"and eat it, for it is my
body offered as a sacrifice."

32:27.840 --> 32:30.880
Well, he's not gonna make it.

32:30.880 --> 32:32.840
You should finish him.

32:32.840 --> 32:34.240
I can't do that.

32:35.720 --> 32:37.480
John!

32:46.040 --> 32:47.640
Do it...

32:51.640 --> 32:53.400
Do it!

32:54.440 --> 32:56.640
- Do it!
- I'll do it.

33:29.360 --> 33:31.720
You can take your fucking rig!

33:52.000 --> 33:54.160
You saved your father's life today.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.320
Blood wins over everything.

34:04.920 --> 34:08.440
You also know nothin' about me.

34:16.600 --> 34:17.840
Goodnight.

34:41.280 --> 34:43.120
I found them in Walt's room.

34:45.640 --> 34:47.360
I'm sure he doesn't care.

34:48.960 --> 34:50.400
Do you want some?

34:59.520 --> 35:01.840
What a day.

35:09.360 --> 35:11.080
Yeah.

35:12.120 --> 35:14.680
What kind of a name is Django anyway?

35:19.200 --> 35:21.000
It's just a name.

35:23.360 --> 35:25.800
So it's not yours?

35:29.440 --> 35:30.840
In this life, it is.

35:36.720 --> 35:39.080
Well, we all deserve a second chance.

35:43.080 --> 35:45.240
You really believe we get one?

35:47.200 --> 35:48.880
Yeah.

35:50.040 --> 35:51.560
Yeah, I do.

35:53.960 --> 35:55.320
Hmm.

36:01.920 --> 36:03.960
Well, if you say it...

36:06.840 --> 36:08.360
...take it.

36:15.600 --> 36:18.600
You can hold on to your gun, stranger.

36:18.600 --> 36:20.280
Are you sure about that?

36:28.240 --> 36:29.920
Alright.

36:33.400 --> 36:35.320
Let me ask you something.

36:36.120 --> 36:37.960
Why didn't you kill her?

36:46.800 --> 36:48.360
She's my oldest friend.

36:57.520 --> 36:59.440
Some strange friends you got.

38:30.040 --> 38:34.200
Father and Sarah both
agree, you're welcome here.

38:34.200 --> 38:37.600
I don't know how to thank you, sir.

38:41.880 --> 38:44.160
Now that you're officially
part of our community,

38:44.160 --> 38:46.120
let's get back to work.

38:46.120 --> 38:47.480
Got it.

39:18.400 --> 39:22.600
- That's a lovely home you have.
- Can you just please shut up.

40:04.440 --> 40:06.480
I just want you to know something.

40:08.600 --> 40:10.160
Just like you...

40:12.040 --> 40:14.360
...I died a long time ago.

40:23.880 --> 40:27.560
But I'm here now. I'm right here.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.760
Maybe over time...

40:34.200 --> 40:36.520
...we'll find a way
to express ourselves.

40:39.640 --> 40:41.040
Or maybe...

40:42.040 --> 40:43.120
Maybe I'll...

40:45.160 --> 40:48.000
I'll be able to repair...

40:48.000 --> 40:51.080
...some of the things I
destroyed by leaving you.

40:52.120 --> 40:55.680
No. You have to go.

40:59.800 --> 41:03.000
John told me everyone here
deserves a second chance.

41:05.480 --> 41:07.240
I deserve one too.

41:10.880 --> 41:13.120
Do you understand that?

41:13.120 --> 41:17.120
Your army killed his son, he would
never give you a second chance.

41:28.040 --> 41:29.680
He doesn't know who you are.

41:31.440 --> 41:34.400
Why don't you tell him who I am?

41:41.200 --> 41:43.480
You have to go.

42:22.480 --> 42:26.000
Daddy's here. Mommy! Car!

42:26.000 --> 42:29.840
Daddy's here. Let's go!

42:29.840 --> 42:31.760
Oh, my God.

42:32.240 --> 42:36.840
Ah... Come here.

42:37.520 --> 42:39.320
Elijah, hi.

43:34.120 --> 43:36.000
Thank God you're home.

43:37.960 --> 43:40.720
Good luck came, just
like you said it would.

43:42.120 --> 43:43.240
Hmm.

43:43.240 --> 43:45.720
It will get us through
the winter, that's it.

43:48.280 --> 43:53.880
Everything's gonna be fine.
I'm so happy to have you back.

44:13.400 --> 44:15.160
I love you.
