WEBVTT

00:29.447 --> 00:31.449
Hah. I'm still winning.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.959
I'd give up now because you are never
going to beat...

00:42.126 --> 00:43.502
- You sure?
- Hey!

00:51.552 --> 00:53.930
How's it feel to lose to your daughter?

00:54.472 --> 00:56.641
It's not over yet.

00:57.683 --> 01:00.228
Sorry,
I can't hear you from first place.

01:00.895 --> 01:01.895
Isaid...

01:02.146 --> 01:03.146
Wait, what's that?

01:04.397 --> 01:05.816
Cheating! That's cheating.

01:06.234 --> 01:07.944
Can't hear you from first place.

01:24.543 --> 01:25.711
Ha-ha!

01:25.795 --> 01:30.466
General alura zor ei,
high defender of Krypton, has lost!

01:30.549 --> 01:33.219
Park computer, activate bench.

01:34.637 --> 01:36.097
Yes!

01:36.222 --> 01:40.017
Kara zor ei, beloved daughter
and crowd favorite has won!

01:40.518 --> 01:41.894
Park computer, water.

01:41.978 --> 01:45.273
Didn't anyone teach you not to gloat?

01:45.815 --> 01:49.735
I mean, the woman in charge
of that lesson also cheats, so...

01:52.780 --> 01:54.073
Your form has gotten better.

01:54.824 --> 01:56.158
You've been practicing.

01:56.242 --> 01:58.703
Every morning.
You're welcome to tag along.

01:58.786 --> 01:59.787
I'm a gracious winner.

02:00.079 --> 02:01.122
I could give you pointers.

02:02.957 --> 02:05.668
Believe me, if I could join you instead
of dealing with

02:05.751 --> 02:08.128
the science council every morning,
I would.

02:08.628 --> 02:10.089
And the guild and...

02:10.172 --> 02:13.426
I know, I know.
You've got all ofargo city to oversee

02:13.509 --> 02:14.844
and no time to do it in.

02:15.344 --> 02:16.344
It's just...

02:16.554 --> 02:19.181
It'd be nice to see you more,
you know?

02:25.813 --> 02:26.813
Hey.

02:27.064 --> 02:29.650
If it's important to you,
then I'll make time.

02:30.860 --> 02:31.902
You come first.

02:31.986 --> 02:34.030
- Really?
- Always, my Kara.

02:34.447 --> 02:35.447
Always.

02:38.159 --> 02:41.162
Besides, I'm not the only one
about to be busy.

02:41.245 --> 02:42.955
Please tell me this isn't a ploy

02:43.039 --> 02:45.499
to get me to watch
uncle jor El's new baby again.

02:45.583 --> 02:48.586
I swear, that kid puts
everything in his mouth.

02:51.589 --> 02:52.715
I... is this...

02:53.257 --> 02:55.926
Does this mean my application
to the guild's been...

02:56.469 --> 02:57.469
Accepted.

02:58.012 --> 03:01.974
Kara zor El, you have officially
been assigned to the military guild.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.101
Welcome to the ranks, cadet.

03:04.935 --> 03:06.437
You've more than earned this.

03:11.025 --> 03:12.025
What is that?

03:17.073 --> 03:18.073
No!

03:20.201 --> 03:21.201
Not now.

03:31.128 --> 03:32.128
Come on!

03:49.730 --> 03:53.859
Computer, begin activation sequence,
code "in-ze."

03:53.943 --> 03:56.529
- What's going on?
- Jor El warned me this was coming.

03:56.612 --> 03:58.572
He told the science council
that they had to act,

03:58.656 --> 04:00.908
but they wouldn't listen.
They never listen!

04:02.451 --> 04:05.663
It's too late for Krypton,
but not for argo city.

04:05.955 --> 04:09.583
I've been building hyper-sleep escape
pods based off jor El's prototype.

04:09.667 --> 04:12.628
The council was against him,
so I've had to do this in secret.

04:13.379 --> 04:15.756
It's why I've been
gone so much. I just...

04:16.423 --> 04:18.466
I just thought we'd have
more time to finish.

04:19.135 --> 04:22.096
We can get everybody out?
Well, that's great, right?

04:23.389 --> 04:25.149
Activation failure.

04:28.310 --> 04:31.856
Activation failure. Activation failure.

04:33.482 --> 04:35.359
- Activation failure.
- No!

04:35.734 --> 04:37.278
Work, damn you, work!

04:37.820 --> 04:39.738
I tried, jory...

04:40.072 --> 04:41.699
I just needed more time to finish them.

04:41.991 --> 04:42.825
Mom.

04:42.908 --> 04:44.076
I tried.

04:44.160 --> 04:46.662
Activation success.

05:09.143 --> 05:11.020
I am so proud of you.

05:15.024 --> 05:21.947
Every day, I am in awe of the strong,
kind, wonderful person you've become.

05:22.615 --> 05:26.452
And I am so lucky to be your mother.

05:43.219 --> 05:48.057
Find your cousin and know
that I will always love you, Kara.

05:48.724 --> 05:50.684
What are you doing?

05:50.768 --> 05:52.478
Mom! No, please!

05:52.561 --> 05:55.189
Mom, please don't do this!
What are you doing? Mom!

08:36.850 --> 08:38.644
Okay. You can do this, Kara.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.854
Mall computer, map.

08:44.149 --> 08:45.776
Mall computer, map.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.946
Map! Map!

08:55.494 --> 08:57.788
How do you locate uniforms
in the supply depot?

09:03.794 --> 09:05.504
Oh.

09:05.713 --> 09:08.132
Great. Yes, thanks.

09:12.136 --> 09:14.388
Mall, bring up...

09:18.016 --> 09:20.769
What a weirdo.

09:20.853 --> 09:22.104
Can you believe that?

09:22.187 --> 09:23.856
Talk about anger issues.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.155
What was that? Oh, no!

09:41.874 --> 09:45.836
Solomon grundy, born on a Monday!

09:52.176 --> 09:55.304
Destroyed Metropolis on a Tuesday!

09:55.387 --> 09:58.307
Killed Superman right now.

09:59.183 --> 10:02.561
Where are you, Superman?

10:03.479 --> 10:06.523
Grundy wants to play!

10:07.107 --> 10:09.985
You do know
grundy and Monday don't rhyme, right?

10:10.611 --> 10:12.988
Also, I'm going to take you down.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.867
You're not Superman.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.410
I'm Supergirl.

10:18.827 --> 10:20.746
Remember the name,
'cause you're...

11:19.388 --> 11:21.640
You're no Superman.

11:25.727 --> 11:28.564
You're not anything, girlie!

12:06.226 --> 12:07.436
I'm fine, kal.

12:12.274 --> 12:13.317
We need to talk.

12:22.618 --> 12:23.618
Hey!

12:23.869 --> 12:26.038
No need to worry, citizen of Metropolis.

12:26.455 --> 12:29.166
- Solomon grundy has been...
- My apartment building!

12:29.291 --> 12:30.500
It... you...

12:30.918 --> 12:32.127
Look what you've done!

12:32.669 --> 12:34.796
Uh, I saved it. You're welcome.

12:35.547 --> 12:37.049
You destroyed it!

12:37.132 --> 12:39.676
Just have your robot servants
build you a better place.

12:40.761 --> 12:42.179
Or government-issued robots.

12:43.472 --> 12:44.556
Construction robots?

12:45.140 --> 12:46.141
Regular robots.

12:46.892 --> 12:47.893
Any robots?

12:49.269 --> 12:51.438
What kind of weird hellscape
are you from?

12:51.772 --> 12:52.814
Krypton is...

12:53.357 --> 12:55.901
Was great.
Not like your backwards planet.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.277
Backwards?

12:57.361 --> 13:00.405
Uh, you live in homes made
out of aluminum and hot sand.

13:00.489 --> 13:01.799
Not anymore, thanks to you!

13:01.823 --> 13:03.635
- Your cousin is a problem.
- You should be thanking me!

13:03.659 --> 13:05.619
- I just saved you!
- You said we could trust her.

13:06.203 --> 13:07.203
We can.

13:07.496 --> 13:09.122
She's only been here a couple of months.

13:09.623 --> 13:10.791
She's doing her best.

13:11.458 --> 13:12.626
It's not good enough.

13:13.251 --> 13:14.461
What's that supposed to mean?

13:15.462 --> 13:17.923
You were so happy to meet someone
alive from Krypton,

13:18.006 --> 13:20.175
you didn't stop to think about
the consequences

13:20.258 --> 13:21.885
for the rest of us mere humans.

13:22.386 --> 13:24.656
In the short time she's been here,
she's destroyed buildings

13:24.680 --> 13:26.515
and failed to control her powers.

13:27.015 --> 13:28.976
Worse, she doesn't care.

13:30.060 --> 13:32.062
With her abilities,
that makes her a threat.

13:33.188 --> 13:35.190
I don't like what you're implying.

13:43.281 --> 13:44.281
Kara...

14:21.153 --> 14:22.654
Sorry, got held up in star city

14:22.738 --> 14:24.573
and didn't get the call
until a second ago.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.200
Hey, where's Superman?

14:28.952 --> 14:30.203
Taking care of a problem.

14:30.495 --> 14:31.788
I'm more worried about this.

14:32.998 --> 14:35.000
Grundy was using it in his rampage.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.502
Wait, Solomon grundy?

14:37.878 --> 14:40.338
The guy who thinks
grundy and Monday rhyme?

14:41.131 --> 14:44.259
There's no way he could build
something this complex.

15:18.335 --> 15:20.420
You know, this is where I used to go

15:21.046 --> 15:22.589
whenever I had a bad day.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.556
I'd sit here as a kid
and look at the stars, and...

15:31.640 --> 15:35.393
Little by little, my problems
would just seem less ovennhelming.

15:36.770 --> 15:39.940
Were any of your problems,
"Batman is kicking me off the planet?"

15:41.316 --> 15:45.529
Not exactly, but I'm pretty sure that's
just because I didn't know him then.

15:48.240 --> 15:50.700
Kara, I can't imagine
what you're going through.

15:50.992 --> 15:54.412
Having to adjust
to a new planet, new powers,

15:54.496 --> 15:55.789
getting knocked off course,

15:55.872 --> 15:58.208
and arriving decades
after you were supposed to.

15:59.167 --> 16:01.628
Finding out your baby cousin
isn't so little anymore.

16:04.172 --> 16:06.133
All I'm asking is that
you be more careful,

16:06.967 --> 16:08.260
and to give earth a chance.

16:08.552 --> 16:09.970
Kal, I'm trying.

16:10.053 --> 16:11.179
I swear.

16:11.429 --> 16:16.643
It's just all so primitive and weird
and wrong and different here.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.187
I know it's not Krypton.

16:19.813 --> 16:21.857
But it could be home, if you let it.

16:21.940 --> 16:23.191
No, it can't!

16:24.151 --> 16:25.861
Krypton is my home.

16:26.278 --> 16:29.114
It doesn't matter that it's gone.
It will always be my home.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.117
Kara, I know you're upset.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.202
You can't possibly know how I feel!

16:36.746 --> 16:40.083
Batman's right.
I don't belong here.

16:40.167 --> 16:42.794
With Krypton gone, with mom gone...

16:44.379 --> 16:45.922
I don't belong anywhere.

16:47.883 --> 16:50.051
So, kick me out. I don't care.

16:55.682 --> 16:58.894
Or we could try something different.

17:14.534 --> 17:15.618
Trust me?

17:41.686 --> 17:42.686
Come on!

17:43.438 --> 17:45.398
Wait! Where are we going?

18:03.416 --> 18:04.417
Whoa.

18:51.006 --> 18:52.340
Where are we?

18:52.799 --> 18:55.218
Earth, in the 3ist century.

18:56.511 --> 19:00.390
Kara zor El,
welcome to the legion of super-heroes.

19:37.886 --> 19:40.138
Please, take the badge. Just...

19:40.221 --> 19:42.432
You can get in. Just don't kill me.

20:35.110 --> 20:36.194
No guns.

20:52.544 --> 20:53.711
Why are you here?

20:54.629 --> 20:55.713
Who are you?

21:03.221 --> 21:07.350
The circle remains unbroken.

21:19.320 --> 21:23.366
Batman to any justice league members,
there's been an attack at star labs.

21:23.450 --> 21:24.617
Do you copy?

21:26.244 --> 21:28.830
No. I don't know what they were after.

21:36.921 --> 21:38.423
Okay, new question.

21:38.590 --> 21:41.468
Uh, how are we in the 3ist century?

21:41.551 --> 21:42.844
Also, why?

21:42.927 --> 21:44.137
Also, what?

21:44.345 --> 21:45.847
We came here with the time bubble.

21:46.264 --> 21:48.933
It's extremely rare technology
that allows travel between

21:49.017 --> 21:52.270
two fixed points in time
and only those points in time.

21:52.896 --> 21:55.356
At least that's how saturn girl
explained it to me.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.734
She's one of the founders
of the legion of super heroes.

21:58.151 --> 22:00.528
Think of them
as the future's justice league.

22:01.070 --> 22:04.532
They're a group of heroes who banded
together to fight crime inspired by...

22:06.451 --> 22:07.451
Well, me.

22:09.204 --> 22:10.872
They contacted me through
the time bubble

22:10.955 --> 22:12.248
after we formed the league.

22:12.874 --> 22:15.168
We've been in sporadic
contact ever since.

22:15.835 --> 22:17.587
Which brings us to why we're here.

22:21.799 --> 22:24.802
They run a training program
for potential new legionnaires.

22:28.097 --> 22:29.140
The legion academy.

22:29.599 --> 22:33.102
I thought, if you wanted,
you could train here.

22:33.186 --> 22:34.395
It's not Krypton,

22:34.854 --> 22:37.357
but it's a little closer
than earth of the 2ist century.

22:42.195 --> 22:43.446
I don't know, kal.

22:44.447 --> 22:46.699
If you want to go back,
it's your decision.

22:47.408 --> 22:48.743
I'll support you either way.

22:49.452 --> 22:50.452
Superman.

22:51.329 --> 22:52.329
Kara?

22:53.498 --> 22:55.917
Oh, wow. It is so great to meet you.

22:58.753 --> 23:02.215
I'm mon El, one of the other trainees
at legion academy.

23:02.298 --> 23:03.341
Mon El?

23:03.675 --> 23:05.718
Wait, you're Kryptonian?

23:05.802 --> 23:08.596
Daxamite, actually, from planet daxam.

23:09.180 --> 23:11.391
But I hope you don't mind
me saying this.

23:11.766 --> 23:12.976
I love Krypton.

23:13.643 --> 23:15.061
That's why I changed my name.

23:15.353 --> 23:17.313
I've been a fan ever since I was a kid.

23:17.855 --> 23:22.235
The scientific wonders,
the emphasis on conformity, order.

23:22.527 --> 23:23.611
The robots.

23:23.945 --> 23:24.945
The robots.

23:25.822 --> 23:29.242
Maybe not so much the kryptonite,
but in every other way,

23:29.325 --> 23:31.494
Krypton was incredible.

23:31.578 --> 23:35.123
I know we've just met,
but I really hope you decide

23:35.206 --> 23:37.083
to come train
with us here at the academy.

23:39.043 --> 23:40.211
- Really?
- Yep.

23:40.503 --> 23:42.880
- It seemed like you weren't sure.
- I am now.

23:42.964 --> 23:45.091
We could still go back and train
on the farm together.

23:45.174 --> 23:46.342
Nope. I'm good.

23:46.426 --> 23:47.427
Lift tractors?

23:47.510 --> 23:49.304
Bye, kal. Sorry, you can't stay.

24:09.532 --> 24:10.658
Want the tour?

24:12.577 --> 24:14.037
This is the legion academy.

24:14.412 --> 24:16.581
It's where our training takes place.

24:16.664 --> 24:19.125
The cube is the fight simulation room.

24:19.208 --> 24:21.836
It's also connected to the legion's
holographic library...

24:24.714 --> 24:26.716
I'm sure you'll be able to find
your way around.

24:27.050 --> 24:28.885
And that's pretty much the tour.

24:29.260 --> 24:30.887
Except the dorms...

24:31.304 --> 24:33.348
Girls are there, boys are there.

24:33.806 --> 24:37.143
And the window we use to sneak out
after curfew is there.

24:37.435 --> 24:38.436
Noted.

24:39.896 --> 24:40.897
What's that one?

24:49.697 --> 24:50.865
That's the vault.

24:50.948 --> 24:52.551
It's where the legion keeps
all the weapons

24:52.575 --> 24:54.035
they've taken from their enemies.

25:00.833 --> 25:03.294
It's protected by an insane
security system,

25:03.378 --> 25:06.464
and it's never been broken into
in the entire history of the legion.

25:07.548 --> 25:09.175
The system's on a hair trigger,

25:09.258 --> 25:11.552
and it's completely off-limits
to us academy members.

25:12.053 --> 25:14.889
So, in other words,
avoid the death lasers.

25:21.270 --> 25:23.272
- This is dawnstar.
- Your roommate.

25:24.232 --> 25:25.232
Oh!

25:26.317 --> 25:28.820
I am so glad to meet
someone else who can fly.

25:28.903 --> 25:32.073
We can pair up in training
and practice cool power combos.

25:32.198 --> 25:34.701
Ooh, and team up for missions.

25:36.994 --> 25:39.872
Sorry. I'm all, "blah, hi, dawnstar."

25:40.456 --> 25:42.041
It's just nice to meet a new friend.

25:42.250 --> 25:44.127
Well, that's everything,

25:44.210 --> 25:46.671
except meeting the rest
of the academy trainees and...

25:52.510 --> 25:53.510
Brainiac?

25:53.845 --> 25:55.346
He's got a weapon. Get back!

25:55.430 --> 25:56.430
Wait!

25:57.515 --> 25:59.350
I don't know
how you survived the bullet,

25:59.434 --> 26:01.936
but I am not going
to let you hurt anyone else.

26:02.019 --> 26:03.688
I don't know what you're talking about.

26:04.105 --> 26:08.234
But given your unhinged actions,
I'm regarding you as a threat.

26:11.779 --> 26:12.947
Unhinged?

26:13.030 --> 26:15.658
You tried to kill Superman, my cousin.

26:21.122 --> 26:23.833
Believe me,
if I had tried to kill Superman,

26:23.916 --> 26:25.668
I would have succeeded.

26:26.335 --> 26:29.464
I am the universe's
only 12th-level intellect.

26:29.547 --> 26:34.177
I invented this force field using
kinetic-reactive photonic energy.

26:38.806 --> 26:43.186
Which means, the more
you punch it, the more solid it gets.

26:58.910 --> 27:00.661
Great. Thanks for the tip.

27:12.632 --> 27:14.467
Okay. That's it.

27:46.415 --> 27:48.376
Fight, fight...

27:48.459 --> 27:50.586
Fight, fight, fight,

27:50.670 --> 27:52.713
fight, fight, fight, fight,

27:52.797 --> 27:55.341
fight, fight, fight, fight.

28:15.403 --> 28:16.487
Stop!

28:18.656 --> 28:20.908
What the ever-loving hell
is going on here?

28:24.662 --> 28:27.957
Reckless endangerment
and damage to a classroom.

28:28.749 --> 28:30.334
What do you have to say for yourselves?

28:36.048 --> 28:37.300
He's brainiac.

28:37.383 --> 28:38.968
Why are we all just sitting here?

28:39.051 --> 28:40.845
As I attempted to tell you,

28:41.512 --> 28:43.180
I am not brainiac.

28:43.764 --> 28:45.308
You pulled a weapon on us.

28:45.725 --> 28:47.325
I was going to make repairs on the laser

28:47.393 --> 28:49.854
for a project
and you jump to conclusions.

28:50.062 --> 28:51.856
Not surprising for a lesser mind.

28:51.939 --> 28:53.566
How is this not a villain?

28:53.649 --> 28:55.651
Kara, he's not brainiac.

28:55.735 --> 28:57.612
This is brainiac 5.

28:57.904 --> 29:00.740
Scientists on planet colu
got their hands on the organic parts

29:00.823 --> 29:02.783
of the original brainiac cyborg

29:02.867 --> 29:05.161
and then used that to make
him and his family.

29:05.244 --> 29:08.664
That is a gross oversimplification
of the cloning process.

29:08.748 --> 29:11.959
- Anyhow...
- Rna mutation alone has allowed me

29:12.043 --> 29:13.419
to surpass my clone siblings.

29:13.502 --> 29:14.754
Anyhow...

29:16.255 --> 29:17.340
He's a bright young man,

29:17.423 --> 29:20.301
and he's enrolled in legion academy,
just like you.

29:20.384 --> 29:22.053
By "bright young man,"

29:22.136 --> 29:24.680
she means I possess
a 12th-level intelligence

29:24.764 --> 29:27.016
as measured by the scientific
minds of col...

29:27.642 --> 29:30.853
Since we don't have time to sufficiently
describe me,

29:30.937 --> 29:32.605
that will have to do.

29:32.939 --> 29:35.942
I've got
some words to describe you.

29:36.025 --> 29:38.945
Unless those words are "genius,"
they're probably incorrect.

29:39.028 --> 29:42.114
Hey, knuckleheads, you're in trouble.

29:42.198 --> 29:44.200
The rest of the legion
are off on a mission,

29:44.283 --> 29:46.035
leaving the three of us in charge,

29:46.118 --> 29:48.829
and you just made our jobs
that much more difficult.

29:48.913 --> 29:50.539
We are truly disappointed.

29:51.165 --> 29:54.293
Since this is your first offense,
we're letting you off with a warning.

29:54.794 --> 29:58.589
But in the future, try to act more like
the heroes you wish to become.

30:00.257 --> 30:01.258
Dismissed.

30:09.433 --> 30:12.311
What is president saturn girl thinking,
letting that kid in?

30:12.395 --> 30:13.771
Superman vouched for Supergirl.

30:13.854 --> 30:16.190
I'm talking about brainiac 5.

30:16.273 --> 30:17.273
Why is he here?

30:18.150 --> 30:21.362
Every single brainiac clone
ever has gone evil.

30:21.445 --> 30:23.739
Brainiac 2
was an intergalactic assassin.

30:23.823 --> 30:27.326
Brainiac 3 tried to overthrow
the united planets with mind control.

30:27.410 --> 30:30.204
Brainiac 4
is just a straight up serial killer.

30:30.287 --> 30:31.664
This is what they do.

30:31.914 --> 30:35.251
The brainiacs show up,
attempt some evil plot, then disappear.

30:35.334 --> 30:38.421
It's only a matter of time
before this kid does the same.

30:39.296 --> 30:41.674
Look, timber wolf, we agree with you,

30:42.383 --> 30:43.384
but we were outvoted.

30:43.843 --> 30:44.843
Were we?

30:45.344 --> 30:48.681
I haven't spoken to a single other
legionnaire who voted to let him in.

30:49.807 --> 30:51.684
I think there's
something fishy going on here.

30:52.560 --> 30:55.646
We've got bigger problems
than your conspiracy theories right now.

31:01.444 --> 31:04.280
We still have no idea
where the rest of the legion is.

31:04.697 --> 31:07.450
Last check-in, saturn girl
and the others were on their way

31:07.533 --> 31:10.077
to deal with the terrorist attacks
on planet durla.

31:10.161 --> 31:13.330
Then, suddenly, boom, radio silence.

31:13.414 --> 31:15.666
Oh. They're still not answering comms?

31:15.750 --> 31:17.710
They're not even showing up on the map.

31:17.793 --> 31:20.046
It's like they disappeared from the face
of the universe.

31:20.379 --> 31:23.090
We've been having computer troubles
over the past 24 hours.

31:23.674 --> 31:25.259
The issue could be on our end.

31:25.342 --> 31:27.094
We can't discount
anything at this point.

31:27.511 --> 31:30.181
Shadow lass, chemical king,
look into our system.

31:30.514 --> 31:31.807
It could just be bouncing boy

31:31.891 --> 31:33.642
pulling pranks
with the comm arrays again.

31:34.143 --> 31:36.187
But if not, we need to be prepared.

31:36.562 --> 31:39.690
And above all,
don't tell the academy kids.

31:40.024 --> 31:41.776
The less who know, the better.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.322
It has to be tonight.

31:57.500 --> 31:59.877
That was epic!

32:00.211 --> 32:01.295
Did they kick you out?

32:01.378 --> 32:04.799
Uh, she
wouldn't be here if they did.

32:05.007 --> 32:06.383
Everyone, give her room.

32:06.926 --> 32:09.595
Kara,
this is the rest of the legion academy.

32:09.678 --> 32:11.764
Seriously, that fight was nuts.

32:11.847 --> 32:13.933
I'm bouncing boy, planet earth.

32:17.728 --> 32:18.854
Ta-da!

32:19.730 --> 32:23.317
Now, if I said to you,
I've got a bunch of naltorian frogs,

32:23.400 --> 32:25.820
would you be down to help me release
them in the science lab?

32:25.903 --> 32:27.905
-No -come on. It'd be great.

32:29.782 --> 32:30.782
EnchantÃ©.

32:31.242 --> 32:33.244
Invisible kid, also from planet earth.

32:34.411 --> 32:35.663
Whoa!

32:35.746 --> 32:37.832
Can you turn other things
invisible too?

32:38.040 --> 32:39.040
Yes.

32:39.166 --> 32:43.045
Well, actually, no,
but I'm really close to figuring it out.

32:44.797 --> 32:46.799
Okay. I love the hair.

32:47.216 --> 32:48.968
Oh, yeah, hate the cape.

32:49.468 --> 32:50.636
We can work with the boots.

32:50.719 --> 32:52.847
Triplicate girl. Planet cargg.

32:53.430 --> 32:55.975
Okay, so, this is phantom girl.

32:59.145 --> 33:00.145
She's shy.

33:04.150 --> 33:05.943
Proty, our class pet.

33:09.071 --> 33:10.071
Hello.

33:10.281 --> 33:12.366
And arms fall off boy.

33:18.706 --> 33:21.625
And sometimes they even stay on.

33:21.709 --> 33:22.709
Wow.

33:23.502 --> 33:26.172
That's... really cool.

33:26.839 --> 33:28.340
No. We suck.

33:28.591 --> 33:30.301
Hey, that's not true.

33:30.509 --> 33:33.637
I'll have you know my psychic
pathfinding powers are unique.

33:33.971 --> 33:35.514
Yes, so are mine.

33:35.598 --> 33:37.016
That doesn't mean they're good.

33:37.099 --> 33:38.976
There's only one open legion spot.

33:39.226 --> 33:41.103
And everyone knows
mon e! Is gonna get it.

33:42.021 --> 33:43.781
We're never going to make
it into the legion.

33:44.023 --> 33:47.067
Faceit
we're waiting-list material at best.

33:48.110 --> 33:50.571
Not even the legion of substitute heroes
would have us.

33:50.654 --> 33:53.282
Hey, you don't know
what's going to happen.

33:53.490 --> 33:55.701
I think everyone
has the potential to be heroes,

33:56.327 --> 33:58.078
even people like brainiac 5.

33:58.662 --> 34:01.582
But maybe, for the safety
of the rest of the buildings,

34:02.625 --> 34:03.834
you should just avoid him.

34:06.337 --> 34:08.496
The legion
does more than simply fight.

34:08.797 --> 34:10.817
- We are the once called in...
- Or maybe you can't.

34:10.841 --> 34:13.052
When there are disasters,
diplomatic incidents

34:13.135 --> 34:14.678
or when people are in need of rescue.

34:15.387 --> 34:16.972
To be considered for the legion,

34:17.056 --> 34:18.681
you need to train your mind.

34:19.266 --> 34:21.768
So, who can solve
this hyperdrive equation?

34:23.687 --> 34:24.687
Supergirl?

34:26.106 --> 34:27.190
Supergirl!

34:43.831 --> 34:45.708
That is clearly incorrect.

34:49.545 --> 34:52.882
The legion does
more than simply solve problems.

34:53.467 --> 34:56.469
We are the front lines,
stopping terrorists,

34:56.553 --> 34:59.056
administering justice,
and preventing war.

34:59.807 --> 35:01.475
To be considered for the legion,

35:01.976 --> 35:03.269
you need to train your body.

35:03.644 --> 35:05.729
Training room, fight simulation beta.

35:06.272 --> 35:07.189
Acknowledged.

35:07.273 --> 35:09.733
Flight simulation beta
will commence now.

35:14.113 --> 35:15.113
Got it!

35:21.870 --> 35:23.289
Oh, no.

35:24.290 --> 35:25.457
Too slow.

35:30.963 --> 35:32.047
No.

35:32.131 --> 35:35.968
You need a stabilizer
so the a! System doesn't malfunction.

35:36.051 --> 35:38.804
No, you don't, because it's already
in the programming.

35:38.887 --> 35:41.807
I am literally
the descendant of a cyborg.

35:41.890 --> 35:44.310
Logically, you should
be listening to me.

35:47.563 --> 35:50.482
I'm from Krypton. We invented robotics.

35:50.566 --> 35:53.569
And I'm from colu, we perfected them.

35:53.902 --> 35:54.902
I'm right!

36:15.257 --> 36:18.052
You are objectively in the wrong.

36:44.078 --> 36:46.622
Okay. Maybe it did need a stabilizer.

36:50.626 --> 36:51.919
We need to shut it down.

36:52.211 --> 36:54.755
- If you damage the psionic processor...
- Way ahead of you.

36:57.257 --> 36:59.676
Just give me some space to move.

37:10.479 --> 37:13.273
There.
Engage the motion targeting system.

37:15.359 --> 37:19.863
Understood.
Everyone stay perfectly still.

37:34.545 --> 37:35.545
Got it.

37:35.587 --> 37:36.964
Impressive thinking.

37:38.340 --> 37:41.260
In truth,
I almost forgot this was all your fault.

37:41.343 --> 37:42.344
My fault?

37:42.761 --> 37:46.473
Listen, you green skinned, overgrown,
poor excuse for a cyborg.

37:46.557 --> 37:48.326
- Where do you get off telling me...
- Nope, I'm done.

37:48.350 --> 37:50.060
You're done. Training over.

37:50.144 --> 37:52.187
- You two are out.
- But_

37:52.271 --> 37:54.940
Disappointment doesn't even
begin to cover your actions.

37:55.023 --> 37:56.817
We will deal with you in the morning.

37:56.900 --> 37:58.193
Until then...

38:07.286 --> 38:09.079
Hey, don't beat yourself up.

38:09.496 --> 38:12.749
Honestly, you are not the first person
to get into a fight with brainiac 5.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.626
- Really?
- Are you serious?

38:15.085 --> 38:17.463
Mr. "I'm more logical than thou?"

38:17.838 --> 38:19.882
He's a jerk who thinks
he's better than everyone.

38:20.424 --> 38:21.884
No one wants him around.

38:22.342 --> 38:24.761
Not even timber wolf
and the other legionnaires.

38:24.845 --> 38:26.430
I mean, hejust doesn't belong here.

38:51.079 --> 38:52.079
What?

38:52.623 --> 38:54.958
Supergirl. You coming?

39:04.259 --> 39:06.887
Like I said, we've got to go before all
the good seats are taken.

39:12.351 --> 39:13.351
Proty.

39:13.685 --> 39:15.062
Where are you?

39:16.230 --> 39:20.067
Please come back before I
have to tell dawnstar I lost you again.

39:20.317 --> 39:24.821
Here, proty, proty, proty.
You good little, uh, thing.

39:28.659 --> 39:29.743
Ugh.

39:30.035 --> 39:32.120
You know what? I'm cold and tired.

39:32.204 --> 39:33.556
Let's give ourselves one more minute,

39:33.580 --> 39:35.832
then figure out a way
to blame bouncing boy for this.

39:37.584 --> 39:39.336
There you are.

39:50.681 --> 39:51.681
What the heck?

40:17.666 --> 40:21.086
Hey, brainiac 5. Look, I'm...

40:21.670 --> 40:25.132
I was kind of a jerk to you.
I mean, you were a biggerjerk to me.

40:27.884 --> 40:30.762
Brainiac 5.
I think we got off on the wrong foot,

40:31.096 --> 40:34.349
but I think we're more
alike than you know and...

40:34.641 --> 40:36.643
Why is this so hard?

40:39.521 --> 40:41.523
Brainiac 5, I'm sorry.

40:42.232 --> 40:43.317
Can we start over?

40:57.080 --> 40:58.080
What are you doing?

40:59.833 --> 41:02.127
Go away. This doesn't concern you.

41:03.253 --> 41:04.253
Uh-huh.

41:05.047 --> 41:06.647
Because it looks
like you're trying to...

41:06.673 --> 41:08.425
I don't...

41:08.508 --> 41:09.508
Proty?

41:09.718 --> 41:10.802
What are you doing out?

41:17.893 --> 41:18.893
Is she...

41:20.187 --> 41:21.187
She... she can't be.

41:22.439 --> 41:23.607
I'm too late.

41:39.039 --> 41:40.666
You won't be needing this.

41:41.041 --> 41:42.417
Stay back, Supergirl.

41:42.626 --> 41:45.170
Brainiac 5 is not who he pretends to be.

41:45.837 --> 41:48.215
He planted a virus
in our computer system.

41:48.298 --> 41:51.051
It's why we haven't been able to reach
the rest of the legion.

41:51.134 --> 41:53.679
And no one voted
to let him join the academy.

41:54.054 --> 41:55.639
He hacked in and changed the tally.

41:55.722 --> 41:56.723
All for this.

41:57.349 --> 42:00.852
To break into the vault and steal
the weapons inside for some sick plot.

42:01.645 --> 42:03.730
We moved as fast as we could
once we knew, but...

42:04.731 --> 42:07.526
Poor triplicate girl paid the price
for our stupidity

42:07.609 --> 42:08.985
in trusting a brainiac.

42:10.737 --> 42:14.533
Yes, I hacked your computers,
but I did not kill triplicate girl.

42:14.866 --> 42:16.618
This is the work of the dark circle.

42:16.743 --> 42:18.680
They've been planning
to infiltrate the legion...

42:18.704 --> 42:20.455
You expect us to believe that?

42:20.789 --> 42:22.708
You have to! I would never hurt...

42:24.835 --> 42:26.795
You're just another clone gone bad.

42:33.760 --> 42:36.805
We'll be at the holding cells.
Put hq on lockdown.

42:37.264 --> 42:39.725
We'll break the news in the morning.

42:41.852 --> 42:44.229
Wait. This doesn't make any sense.

42:44.312 --> 42:48.900
Why would brainiac 5 go to the vault,
kill triplicate girl and then walk away,

42:49.609 --> 42:51.528
only to come back
just in time to get caught?

42:52.654 --> 42:54.531
She clearly surprised
him the first time.

42:54.906 --> 42:57.451
He stupidly panicked,
then came back to finish the job.

42:58.869 --> 43:02.998
Exactly. That's stupid,
and brainiac 5 isn't stupid.

43:03.498 --> 43:04.791
What if he wasn't lying?

43:05.125 --> 43:08.211
I feel like I've heard the name
dark circle before. It's...

43:09.045 --> 43:10.422
Familiar somehow.

43:11.423 --> 43:13.008
Brainiac 5 is evil.

43:13.842 --> 43:14.842
You were right.

43:15.469 --> 43:16.469
Go back to the dorms.

43:17.429 --> 43:18.429
It's over now.

43:47.542 --> 43:50.086
Training room, access library databanks.

43:50.420 --> 43:52.839
Bring up any information
you have on the dark circle.

43:53.590 --> 43:55.990
Accessing files on the dark circle.

43:56.551 --> 43:58.553
Searching. Searching.

43:59.304 --> 44:00.304
Found.

44:03.308 --> 44:05.668
The dark circle. A terrorist cult.

44:05.727 --> 44:08.814
The dark circle has gone by many names
over the centuries.

44:09.231 --> 44:14.444
The black zero. The ouroboros.
The beginning. The end.

44:14.694 --> 44:17.447
But they are always identified
by the same symbol.

44:18.740 --> 44:19.740
Who are they?

44:19.783 --> 44:22.452
Fanatics, pursuing an unknown goal.

44:22.786 --> 44:23.662
Over the centuries,

44:23.745 --> 44:26.915
they emerge to wreak havoc,
blowing up buildings,

44:26.998 --> 44:30.043
providing weapons of advanced origin
to other terrorist groups.

44:30.585 --> 44:33.588
There are even reports of them
appearing as observers.

44:34.714 --> 44:35.714
Watching.

44:35.966 --> 44:36.966
Waiting.

44:38.218 --> 44:40.804
Then they vanish. No trace to be found.

44:41.596 --> 44:44.766
Leader, unknown. Origins, unknown.

44:45.058 --> 44:46.142
End of file.

44:46.685 --> 44:47.769
Powering down.

45:09.082 --> 45:10.750
Huh?

45:18.884 --> 45:23.847
I've seen them, the dark circle,
in the past and also here, now.

45:24.264 --> 45:26.766
You said I'm too late.
Too late for what?

45:27.183 --> 45:28.183
What's going on?

45:33.440 --> 45:35.150
I'm not going anywhere, so talk.

45:38.653 --> 45:40.614
You're relentless. You know that, right?

45:44.034 --> 45:46.328
Created by the god-like
controllers of oa,

45:47.078 --> 45:50.290
the miracle machine allows
a user to bend reality to their will.

45:50.874 --> 45:53.668
Its original purpose disappeared
with the controllers.

45:54.085 --> 45:55.085
Since then,

45:55.462 --> 45:58.506
it has been used as a weapon
of mass destruction.

45:59.633 --> 46:01.718
The legion managed
to get their hands on it,

46:02.802 --> 46:04.137
and placed it in the vault.

46:04.220 --> 46:07.098
I overheard my family making plans
to break into the vault

46:07.182 --> 46:09.059
and steal the machine
for the circle's leader.

46:09.768 --> 46:11.102
I couldn't let that happen.

46:11.937 --> 46:15.690
So, logically,
there was only one thing to do.

46:16.775 --> 46:19.819
Enroll myself in the academy
and take the machine before they did.

46:19.903 --> 46:23.198
Wouldn't the logical thing have been
to just tell the legion?

46:23.281 --> 46:25.325
Ah, yes, let's try that.

46:25.742 --> 46:29.162
"Hi, I'm the grandson of one of earth's
greatest villains.

46:29.245 --> 46:30.330
My family is psychotic,

46:30.413 --> 46:32.958
and I need you to let me take a weapon
of mass destruction."

46:35.502 --> 46:36.586
Why would they believe me?

46:38.338 --> 46:39.338
No one ever does.

46:40.632 --> 46:42.634
I'm sure you assume I'm lying too, so...

46:43.635 --> 46:44.678
You know, just go.

46:57.399 --> 47:00.610
Come on. If the dark circle is here,
we don't have very much time.

47:00.694 --> 47:01.528
What are you doing?

47:01.611 --> 47:04.114
I'm helping you break into the vault
and get the machine.

47:04.197 --> 47:06.116
If they had it,
they'd have used it by now.

47:06.199 --> 47:07.450
I think we can still beat them.

47:10.912 --> 47:12.789
No, I mean, why?

47:13.915 --> 47:15.417
Because I believe you.

47:19.421 --> 47:21.297
Timber wolf
and the others will be patrolling.

47:21.715 --> 47:23.842
How are we going to get past them
without my belt?

47:42.360 --> 47:43.695
And this is humiliating.

47:43.778 --> 47:44.778
This is fun!

47:44.988 --> 47:46.215
I had a nightmare like this once.

47:46.239 --> 47:49.325
If you don't stop complaining,
I'll start flying upside down.

48:01.880 --> 48:03.173
All right, the coast is clear.

48:03.423 --> 48:04.549
Wait...

48:04.632 --> 48:06.676
Supergirl, I...

48:07.719 --> 48:09.721
Logically, you have no reason
to help me,

48:10.221 --> 48:11.221
but you are.

48:11.931 --> 48:14.684
So, for my previous actions,

48:15.435 --> 48:16.686
- I'm sorry...
- Shh.

48:16.770 --> 48:18.146
Are you trying to get caught?

48:19.064 --> 48:20.064
Keep it down.

48:20.398 --> 48:21.232
Mon El?

48:21.316 --> 48:22.984
I heard timber wolf
and the others talking

48:23.068 --> 48:24.694
as I was heading back to the dorms.

48:24.944 --> 48:27.405
I know everything and I want to help.

48:28.656 --> 48:29.741
I trust Supergirl.

48:30.408 --> 48:32.243
If she thinks you're innocent,
then I do too.

48:32.327 --> 48:34.996
That's great!
We could definitely use help.

48:35.080 --> 48:36.080
Right, brainy?

48:36.790 --> 48:38.792
Yeah. Great.

48:39.167 --> 48:40.167
Of course!

48:40.543 --> 48:42.212
So, what are we doing?

48:43.755 --> 48:47.133
Breaking the universe's most unbreakable
security system.

49:26.214 --> 49:28.842
- What is this?
- This is the security code.

49:29.342 --> 49:30.844
The vault has a two-step process.

49:31.261 --> 49:33.179
First, the laser grid, then this.

49:33.847 --> 49:37.142
Break the code and a door will open
into the exact chamber we want.

49:37.684 --> 49:39.352
But we only have a short
window of time.

49:39.435 --> 49:40.435
How short?

49:47.527 --> 49:50.864
If I don't break this in the next
30 seconds, they kill us.

49:50.947 --> 49:51.990
Can you do it?

49:52.407 --> 49:53.741
I'm brainiac 5.

49:54.159 --> 49:56.953
The universe's
only 12th-level intelligence.

49:57.203 --> 49:59.330
I can do anything.

50:17.182 --> 50:18.182
Incredible.

50:18.892 --> 50:22.687
The code is a holographic neural overlay
designed to cook the user's brain,

50:23.479 --> 50:26.816
unless they can decrypt while keeping
a mental lock on their objective.

50:27.525 --> 50:31.112
This is...
Going to take longer than I thought.

50:31.196 --> 50:32.196
How much longer?

50:34.949 --> 50:35.992
More than 30 seconds.

50:36.075 --> 50:38.369
Keep working on the code.
I'll take out the robots.

50:39.537 --> 50:41.789
Whatever you do, don't destroy them.

50:42.373 --> 50:43.625
The instant one breaks,

50:43.708 --> 50:45.418
it'll trigger a purge
of the entire room.

50:45.501 --> 50:48.296
Brainy, I'm not great
at gently fighting things.

50:50.048 --> 50:51.674
Just try!

51:11.402 --> 51:13.655
Not to rush you, but hurry it up.

51:13.738 --> 51:14.781
I'm trying.

51:15.657 --> 51:18.701
The code keeps resetting.

51:37.845 --> 51:38.845
Got it!

52:08.042 --> 52:09.042
That's it.

52:09.168 --> 52:10.670
Whoo!

52:10.753 --> 52:11.753
We did it!

52:15.300 --> 52:16.300
We did it.

52:18.845 --> 52:19.971
We certainly did.

52:21.889 --> 52:23.683
Brainiac 5 broke the code...

52:28.187 --> 52:30.440
And the circle remains unbroken.

52:43.244 --> 52:44.370
Kara!

52:45.663 --> 52:48.374
What are you doing?

52:48.458 --> 52:50.835
For the universe's
only 12th-level intellect,

52:50.918 --> 52:52.920
you sure are dumb, aren't you?

52:55.340 --> 52:57.759
I'm in the dark circle.

54:16.129 --> 54:18.423
I'd stop moving so much if I were you.

54:18.881 --> 54:21.801
It spreads the kryptonite
from the dagger faster.

54:22.009 --> 54:23.845
Why?

54:23.928 --> 54:26.389
Of all people,
you should understand.

54:27.223 --> 54:30.726
Your culture was the greatest
the universe had ever seen.

54:31.269 --> 54:34.355
Orderly. Uniform. Pure.

54:35.356 --> 54:36.941
But this world we live in,

54:37.650 --> 54:39.402
this world is rotten.

54:39.694 --> 54:42.321
The legion is the heart of the rot,

54:42.405 --> 54:46.451
encouraging losers like triplicate girl
and bouncing boy.

54:47.118 --> 54:50.621
They delude misfits into thinking
they can be heroes,

54:50.705 --> 54:52.415
when they're just freaks.

54:54.792 --> 54:57.670
Now, the dark circle
will take over.

54:58.045 --> 54:59.982
We, who are superior,

55:00.006 --> 55:01.446
will lead the way...

55:02.717 --> 55:07.054
Elevating the world to heights
not seen since the Kryptonian empire.

55:10.266 --> 55:11.726
The legion has fallen.

55:12.477 --> 55:15.021
The time of freaks has ended.

55:15.480 --> 55:18.483
As for you two,
our leader would like a word.

55:32.288 --> 55:33.288
Hold on, Kara.

55:33.873 --> 55:34.916
Just hold on.

55:35.208 --> 55:39.337
Be silent in the presence
of the beginning and the end.

55:44.884 --> 55:47.303
Hello, grandson.

55:49.430 --> 55:50.430
Brainiac.

55:51.474 --> 55:52.892
No, impossible.

55:53.559 --> 55:54.559
You're dead.

55:55.144 --> 55:57.480
You died in the 2ist century!

55:58.731 --> 56:02.068
The kryptonite bullet
went through my brain, yes,

56:02.985 --> 56:06.656
but there was enough left
to rebuild around the damage.

56:07.240 --> 56:11.953
And a genius like myself never
goes without a backup plan.

56:12.453 --> 56:16.457
I created the dark circle
a 1,000 years past

56:16.541 --> 56:20.002
to carry out my vision for a new world.

56:20.670 --> 56:24.674
It was the circle who stole my brain
out of my old body.

56:25.091 --> 56:30.805
It was they who regrew it,
tending to me over the centuries.

56:31.097 --> 56:36.018
But all would be for naught
if it weren't for you.

56:38.145 --> 56:39.146
What do you mean?

56:39.939 --> 56:43.234
Did you think you just
happened to overhear

56:43.317 --> 56:46.320
our plans to take the miracle machine?

56:47.989 --> 56:51.909
The other clones
were mere 10th-level intelligences.

56:51.993 --> 56:57.164
There was only one being in the universe
who could break the security code.

56:57.915 --> 56:58.916
You.

56:59.792 --> 57:03.671
We used you to get the machine.

57:04.088 --> 57:05.088
Were...

57:05.423 --> 57:08.217
You said my clone siblings
were 10th-level.

57:09.051 --> 57:10.094
Where are they?

57:11.846 --> 57:13.055
Hmm.

57:13.556 --> 57:15.057
Right here.

57:15.850 --> 57:20.855
By the time my brain finished regrowing,
my old body was useless.

57:21.480 --> 57:23.232
The circle cloned me,

57:23.316 --> 57:27.653
and I picked the best parts
from each to build a new one.

57:27.737 --> 57:31.657
They weren't pleased
when they found out.

57:32.325 --> 57:33.909
You lied to us.

57:34.410 --> 57:35.578
Stay away!

57:35.911 --> 57:37.121
Stay away from me!

57:37.246 --> 57:39.457
No! No! God, no!

57:40.249 --> 57:44.545
But, logically,
what other purpose could you serve?

57:44.629 --> 57:46.756
The fools thought
they were being groomed

57:46.839 --> 57:49.759
as the next leader of the dark circle.

57:49.842 --> 57:53.346
For hubris alone, they deserve death.

57:53.763 --> 57:58.559
I am the most advanced
mind that has ever existed.

57:58.893 --> 58:02.188
Thus, logically, I must be the one

58:02.271 --> 58:06.067
to purge the universe of chaos and rot.

58:06.442 --> 58:10.404
For those who are superior
will lead the way

58:10.488 --> 58:13.532
to a pure and orderly future.

58:14.617 --> 58:18.120
The only one strong enough
to stop me was Supergirl.

58:18.537 --> 58:23.125
So, we watched her
and found her weakness.

58:23.209 --> 58:26.003
Kryptonite.

58:26.587 --> 58:31.092
And your drive to help
those more pathetic than yourself.

58:32.343 --> 58:33.886
You're a monster.

58:36.472 --> 58:38.224
I am a hero.

58:38.599 --> 58:42.853
There are threats on the horizon
only I can counter.

58:43.145 --> 58:46.232
When I bend reality to my will,

58:46.315 --> 58:51.112
all will laud me as their savior.

58:53.114 --> 58:58.077
Once Supergirl is dead,
I will incorporate you into my body.

58:58.160 --> 59:01.080
The son will become the father,

59:01.622 --> 59:05.459
and the circle will remain unbroken.

59:16.971 --> 59:18.055
Find them.

59:18.597 --> 59:21.976
I will begin to attune
myself to the machine.

59:32.319 --> 59:33.529
Hurts.

59:33.612 --> 59:34.612
It's going to be okay.

59:35.614 --> 59:38.492
I just need to get the kryptonite
out of your wound, all right?

59:43.330 --> 59:46.792
No! I'm working on something,
but you've got to stay awake.

59:48.419 --> 59:49.420
Kara.

59:50.421 --> 59:51.421
Kara?

59:52.840 --> 59:53.840
Trying to.

59:54.258 --> 59:56.427
Keep talking.

01:00:03.392 --> 01:00:05.728
Talking to people is not my strong suit.

01:00:06.771 --> 01:00:08.981
Could I list
chemical compositions instead?

01:00:11.609 --> 01:00:14.320
No, no, no. Kara!

01:00:14.403 --> 01:00:15.403
Stay with me.

01:00:28.667 --> 01:00:29.794
I'm sorry.

01:00:31.003 --> 01:00:32.505
I was wrong about everything.

01:00:32.755 --> 01:00:35.341
I'm supposed to be smart and logical,

01:00:35.424 --> 01:00:37.927
but my plan to stop the dark circle
wasn't logical.

01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:40.387
It was me trying
to prove to everyone that I...

01:00:40.471 --> 01:00:41.806
I'm not my family.

01:00:42.848 --> 01:00:45.100
I'm not just another evil clone.

01:00:47.561 --> 01:00:49.480
But I'm not. I messed it up.

01:00:50.439 --> 01:00:51.607
I'm not like you.

01:00:52.024 --> 01:00:53.150
You're so confident,

01:00:53.776 --> 01:00:54.777
and brilliant,

01:00:55.402 --> 01:00:56.862
and strong, and...

01:00:57.905 --> 01:00:58.905
And?

01:01:04.578 --> 01:01:05.621
And beautiful.

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:07.080
And?

01:01:07.122 --> 01:01:09.458
And I can't think straight
when you smile at me.

01:01:38.571 --> 01:01:40.614
- Well, there you two are.
- Finally.

01:01:40.781 --> 01:01:41.949
Good work, pg.

01:01:42.283 --> 01:01:44.243
- Triplicate girl?
- You're alive.

01:01:44.869 --> 01:01:46.620
Yeah, no thanks to mon El!

01:01:46.704 --> 01:01:48.264
You know that son of a bitch killed me?

01:01:48.497 --> 01:01:50.916
You know, I saw him meeting up
with those people in masks.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.711
I peeled off an extra me
right before I got to the vault

01:01:53.794 --> 01:01:55.546
and he killed my third self.

01:01:55.629 --> 01:01:57.381
So, I need you nerds
to come up with a plan

01:01:57.464 --> 01:01:59.300
to save the day
so I can kill him right back.

01:01:59.383 --> 01:02:02.219
Did I mention, I'm going to kill him?

01:02:02.303 --> 01:02:04.072
Yeah, only about,
like, a million times.

01:02:04.096 --> 01:02:05.096
Invisible kid?

01:02:05.472 --> 01:02:06.632
In the flesh.

01:02:06.682 --> 01:02:09.059
Phantom girl found triplicate girl
right before the attack.

01:02:09.143 --> 01:02:10.895
I managed to turn invisible and escape.

01:02:10.978 --> 01:02:13.147
And the three of us
have been hiding ever since.

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:16.025
And your clothes are...

01:02:16.734 --> 01:02:19.069
On! The clothes are on!

01:02:19.153 --> 01:02:21.155
I turned all of me invisible this time.

01:02:21.238 --> 01:02:23.198
See, I told you.
I told you I almost had it.

01:02:23.282 --> 01:02:25.034
So, the teachers are knocked out,

01:02:25.117 --> 01:02:26.761
the rest of the academy
members are trapped,

01:02:26.785 --> 01:02:29.580
and I am just itching
to give mon e! A little...

01:02:29.663 --> 01:02:30.748
Payback.

01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:33.167
What happened to,
"we're waiting-list material?"

01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:36.211
No. Screw that. I'm pissed.

01:02:36.295 --> 01:02:38.923
Now, we're kicking-ass material.

01:02:39.131 --> 01:02:40.491
The legion is gone.

01:02:41.050 --> 01:02:42.050
It's up to us.

01:02:42.635 --> 01:02:44.094
So, let's go be heroes.

01:02:47.890 --> 01:02:49.850
You've got an idea, don't you?

01:02:53.062 --> 01:02:56.523
I have the beginnings of a plan,
yes, but_

01:02:56.607 --> 01:02:59.234
We'll need all the academy
members to pull it off.

01:02:59.818 --> 01:03:00.921
Yeah. Uh, excuse me.

01:03:00.945 --> 01:03:02.279
Is the plan to flirt forever?

01:03:02.363 --> 01:03:04.424
Because we're kind
of in a time crunch here, lovebirds.

01:03:04.448 --> 01:03:06.700
Oh, that's not I... I mean...

01:03:08.452 --> 01:03:09.453
It's okay.

01:03:09.536 --> 01:03:10.996
What do you need us to do?

01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:52.079
I can't find a trace
of the legion anywhere.

01:03:52.621 --> 01:03:53.621
Then let me.

01:04:10.806 --> 01:04:11.974
Still nothing...

01:04:22.109 --> 01:04:24.570
Quadrant beta, orbiting the black star
by planet winath.

01:04:26.321 --> 01:04:29.283
Encrypting message,
compensating for cosmic interference

01:04:29.366 --> 01:04:32.661
from the black hole, and the sos is...

01:04:33.537 --> 01:04:34.537
Sent.

01:04:42.755 --> 01:04:44.089
- Yes!
- Yeah! All right!

01:04:48.844 --> 01:04:50.220
Now, the hard part.

01:04:52.806 --> 01:04:53.806
Keep searching.

01:04:54.058 --> 01:04:56.643
Brainiac has almost finished
syncing to the machine.

01:04:57.061 --> 01:04:58.687
We can't let them ruin this now.

01:04:58.771 --> 01:04:59.855
You mean us?

01:05:03.442 --> 01:05:04.442
Get them!

01:05:48.695 --> 01:05:49.905
Nice try.

01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:14.012
Move away from the machine, brainiac.

01:06:14.555 --> 01:06:15.597
It's over.

01:06:15.889 --> 01:06:17.224
No.

01:06:17.891 --> 01:06:20.185
It is just beginning.

01:06:23.897 --> 01:06:25.232
I see it.

01:06:25.607 --> 01:06:27.860
The shape of all things.

01:06:27.985 --> 01:06:29.903
An endless circle,

01:06:29.987 --> 01:06:33.782
which I break and form anew.

01:06:40.372 --> 01:06:45.169
Those deluded enough
to think themselves my equal will fall.

01:06:57.472 --> 01:07:01.643
As will those
strong enough to ever pose a threat.

01:07:05.272 --> 01:07:10.569
And any world that could ever disrupt
the dominance of brainiac!

01:07:29.296 --> 01:07:35.177
I thought I was brilliant before,
but I was nothing.

01:07:35.719 --> 01:07:40.557
Now, I am the supreme being!

01:07:41.516 --> 01:07:42.601
Hardly.

01:07:43.393 --> 01:07:46.271
You just happen to be the one

01:07:46.897 --> 01:07:48.732
holding the machine.

01:07:48.815 --> 01:07:52.110
I always thought
us clones surpassed you.

01:07:52.986 --> 01:07:55.614
You were copies of greatness.

01:07:55.697 --> 01:07:58.533
I am the mastermind of reality.

01:07:58.617 --> 01:08:01.620
I am the leader of the dark circle.

01:08:01.703 --> 01:08:02.621
I am...

01:08:02.704 --> 01:08:05.332
The greatest mind
the universe has ever known!

01:08:05.415 --> 01:08:08.043
I am greater than what came before me.

01:08:08.126 --> 01:08:11.922
I am a 10th-level intellect
and you are nothing.

01:08:12.005 --> 01:08:15.217
No! You serve me.

01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:18.261
Your wills are no match for mine!

01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:19.971
You are obsolete.

01:08:20.346 --> 01:08:23.308
As long as the miracle machine
is in this reality,

01:08:23.392 --> 01:08:25.935
it will obey the will
of its last user.

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:28.981
And that will be me, not you.

01:08:29.064 --> 01:08:31.441
No, it will be me.

01:08:31.692 --> 01:08:34.278
I am the heir to the dark circle!

01:08:34.528 --> 01:08:37.406
I alone will rule this new reality.

01:08:37.488 --> 01:08:39.573
No, iwill.

01:08:58.343 --> 01:08:59.344
Stop!

01:09:02.096 --> 01:09:04.599
You will destroy us, you idiots!

01:09:06.268 --> 01:09:08.312
There can only be...

01:09:09.729 --> 01:09:10.772
Oneleader

01:09:14.109 --> 01:09:15.569
who's it going to be?

01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:56.068
It's not stopping.

01:09:56.485 --> 01:09:58.070
Brainiac 4 was right.

01:09:58.570 --> 01:10:01.073
The machine won't stop
until reality unravels.

01:10:16.505 --> 01:10:19.049
How is this the only thing
I'm not able to break?

01:10:46.701 --> 01:10:47.701
Mom?

01:10:54.334 --> 01:10:56.044
I... I could bring her back.

01:10:59.506 --> 01:11:01.299
I could bring Krypton back.

01:11:08.932 --> 01:11:11.309
But it won't stop reality from breaking.

01:11:28.493 --> 01:11:29.493
Imiss you...

01:11:31.079 --> 01:11:32.747
Every single day.

01:11:34.583 --> 01:11:36.168
I wish things were different.

01:11:37.794 --> 01:11:39.212
But Krypton is gone.

01:11:40.172 --> 01:11:41.423
And I'm needed here.

01:11:46.094 --> 01:11:47.471
I have to let you go now...

01:11:49.264 --> 01:11:50.557
And save the world.

01:11:51.475 --> 01:11:53.477
I just hope I've made you proud.

01:11:59.357 --> 01:12:02.194
Always, my Kara, always.

01:12:19.878 --> 01:12:22.589
The miracle machine
will continue to destroy everything

01:12:22.672 --> 01:12:24.925
as long as it's in this reality.

01:12:25.008 --> 01:12:27.928
- So...
- Let's will it into a different one.

01:14:04.357 --> 01:14:06.234
Thank you.

01:14:06.735 --> 01:14:07.735
For what?

01:14:33.887 --> 01:14:35.430
I got ya, triplicate girl!

01:14:35.722 --> 01:14:36.722
Thanks, bouncy.

01:14:39.476 --> 01:14:41.019
It's duplicate girl now.

01:14:45.357 --> 01:14:46.650
I like the new name.

01:14:50.028 --> 01:14:53.490
What about "duo damsel?"
Ya know, alliteration's kinda cool.

01:14:59.162 --> 01:15:00.162
Never mind.

01:15:10.548 --> 01:15:12.300
Wait. We're picking new names?

01:15:12.384 --> 01:15:15.720
Then from now on,
I am arms fall off man!

01:15:20.308 --> 01:15:23.019
Oh. All right. I love it!

01:15:25.855 --> 01:15:27.695
I thought you said
they were useless!

01:15:27.774 --> 01:15:29.109
They... they were.

01:15:30.151 --> 01:15:32.445
Retreat! Everyone, fall back!

01:15:37.367 --> 01:15:39.828
Oh, no, you don't. Pg, here!

01:15:50.588 --> 01:15:51.588
Hey, guys.

01:15:51.965 --> 01:15:53.425
Save any for us?

01:16:30.795 --> 01:16:33.298
There's still time to change your mind.

01:16:33.673 --> 01:16:35.216
There will always be a place

01:16:35.300 --> 01:16:38.344
in the dark circle
for those with true power.

01:16:39.137 --> 01:16:41.014
You and I could lead it.

01:16:41.306 --> 01:16:43.349
And bring back the pride of Krypton.

01:16:45.477 --> 01:16:48.521
Oh, mon El, you'rejust wrong.

01:17:14.464 --> 01:17:15.904
Hey there, mon El.

01:17:18.176 --> 01:17:19.552
Where are you going?

01:17:21.888 --> 01:17:22.888
Shit.

01:17:29.771 --> 01:17:31.851
That's the last of them
for the holding cells.

01:17:32.899 --> 01:17:34.484
All that's left to do is wait for...

01:18:00.885 --> 01:18:01.885
Damn.

01:18:02.136 --> 01:18:04.556
I vote they all
get in as full legionnaires.

01:18:17.902 --> 01:18:20.029
I'm sorry we couldn't bring
Krypton back.

01:18:21.906 --> 01:18:22.906
Or your mother.

01:18:24.033 --> 01:18:25.118
If you want,

01:18:25.702 --> 01:18:28.705
I could start researching
a way to replicate the machine.

01:18:31.666 --> 01:18:34.711
I mean, logically,
it would be a terrible idea but...

01:18:36.504 --> 01:18:37.504
It's okay.

01:18:37.839 --> 01:18:39.591
Earth's not so bad. It's...

01:18:40.341 --> 01:18:42.343
Definitely got a couple of good points.

01:18:45.305 --> 01:18:46.305
Interesting.

01:18:47.056 --> 01:18:50.101
In the name of research,
we better add to those points.

01:18:50.768 --> 01:18:52.145
Genius idea.

01:21:43.483 --> 01:21:45.777
And then duplicate girl shot him!

01:21:46.444 --> 01:21:47.570
And then she shot him again.

01:21:47.987 --> 01:21:50.990
In retrospect, I think it was a mistake
to let her keep that gun.

01:21:51.074 --> 01:21:53.242
But saturn girl was still thrilled!

01:21:53.326 --> 01:21:54.577
That's great, Kara.

01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:56.621
Seems like being
a legionnaire really suits you.

01:21:58.498 --> 01:22:02.502
Oh, and brainy's been making tons
of upgrades on legion hq,

01:22:02.585 --> 01:22:05.505
including rigging up the time bubbles
so we can talk more.

01:22:05.588 --> 01:22:06.631
Here, hold on.

01:22:07.632 --> 01:22:09.175
What are you... Kara.

01:22:09.634 --> 01:22:12.345
Kal, I'd like you to meet brainiac 5,

01:22:12.428 --> 01:22:16.557
the universe's only 12th-level intellect
and my boyfriend.

01:22:18.810 --> 01:22:20.436
It's... it's an honor to meet you.

01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:21.562
I mean, talk...

01:22:21.646 --> 01:22:23.231
Uh...

01:22:23.606 --> 01:22:24.606
Sir.

01:22:25.525 --> 01:22:28.069
I'm happy to meet you, brainiac 5.

01:22:29.028 --> 01:22:30.380
Uh, but if you two will excuse me,

01:22:30.404 --> 01:22:33.032
I've got to get back to being...
Superman.

01:22:35.201 --> 01:22:37.036
- Of course.
- Bye, kal.

01:22:37.370 --> 01:22:38.370
Talk soon.

01:22:39.497 --> 01:22:40.665
You didn't tell her?

01:22:42.458 --> 01:22:45.086
How am I supposed to ask
her to come back to the 2ist century

01:22:45.169 --> 01:22:47.630
when we still don't know
what's happening?
