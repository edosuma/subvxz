CARTER:
Previously on Eureka...

00:03.212 --> 00:05.749
ALLISON: If we're going
to be working together
and sleeping together

00:05.881 --> 00:07.746
things are going
to get complicated.

00:08.091 --> 00:09.592
I can handle complicated.

00:11.637 --> 00:12.968
(BOTH SCREAMING)

00:15.807 --> 00:18.674
Jo and l, we used to
be something, but...

00:18.810 --> 00:20.892
I don't know what
and she does.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.387
What are you doing
with my grandmother's
nng,Jo?

00:23.524 --> 00:27.392
There's something you
should know about
Jo and the other you.

00:28.445 --> 00:32.688
Behold, the world's
first wormhole FTL.

00:32.824 --> 00:35.236
ZANE: You cracked manned
Faster than Light travel?

00:40.040 --> 00:42.372
Dr. Fargo, l'm...

00:42.501 --> 00:43.911
Senator Michaela Wen.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.250
I know who you are.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.711
You did just
launch a rocket

00:47.923 --> 00:50.790
that nearly took out
the International
Space Station.

00:51.969 --> 00:52.924
Get comfortable.

00:53.136 --> 00:56.799
Your future in Eureka
is about to get
very complicated.

01:00.811 --> 01:02.142
(BEEPING)

01:02.396 --> 01:05.058
(GET THIS PARTY
STARTED PLAYING)

01:09.152 --> 01:11.313
Oh, that can just
go right over there.
You got it.

01:16.159 --> 01:18.946
Morning.
Uh, coffee will be
ready in a minute.

01:19.121 --> 01:20.327
Did... Did you want
to wait inside?

01:20.455 --> 01:21.490
Oh, no.

01:21.957 --> 01:23.948
I mean,
I'll wait out here.
That's fine.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.745
I'd just rather
not sit, is all.

01:25.877 --> 01:27.162
I've been flying
for seven hours.

01:27.296 --> 01:30.083
Well, not me personally.
I was on a plane.

01:30.215 --> 01:31.204
I prefer trains though

01:31.341 --> 01:33.297
because you can
put your stuff on
the seat next to you

01:33.427 --> 01:34.507
and people
won't sit there

01:34.636 --> 01:37.048
and you can get up
and walk around.

01:37.472 --> 01:38.461
I'm fine out here.

01:38.599 --> 01:41.011
So, decaf?

01:42.102 --> 01:43.182
No.

01:46.064 --> 01:48.020
Good morning, Larry.

01:52.070 --> 01:53.526
Morning, Larry.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.236
Oh, oh, that hurts.

01:55.907 --> 01:57.408
Oh, sorry I'm awake.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.399
How's the vacation?
Fantastic.

01:59.536 --> 02:02.949
Last night,
I saw the sunset
on the beach...

02:03.123 --> 02:04.033
Awesome.

02:04.166 --> 02:06.373
So, what's on
the docket today?

02:06.501 --> 02:09.493
You have an 8:00 am.
with Dr. Elwood
in biogenetics

02:09.671 --> 02:11.832
about specs with
some containment unit...

02:11.965 --> 02:13.341
(MUTTERING)
Not right now,
not right now.

02:13.759 --> 02:16.546
Uh, conference call
at 8:30 with
Senator Wen.

02:16.678 --> 02:18.009
9:00 am.
with Dr. Parrish.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.639
Parrish? Reschedule.

02:19.765 --> 02:21.505
What would you like
the reason to be?

02:21.642 --> 02:23.724
Uh, how about
because I hate
his stupid face

02:23.852 --> 02:25.092
and I can't stand
his whining.

02:25.228 --> 02:26.479
Right, message sent.

02:26.605 --> 02:28.061
Oh, no, no, no.
I wasjoking.

02:28.190 --> 02:29.726
Oh, yes, of course
you were.

02:29.858 --> 02:32.065
I totally got that,
but I just have to...

02:32.194 --> 02:34.059
Give me
a second here.

02:34.196 --> 02:36.312
Just keep the meeting.
What else?

02:38.533 --> 02:39.989
VINCENT: Would you
like a Vinspresso?

02:40.118 --> 02:41.654
Oh, no,
I don't drink coffee.

02:41.787 --> 02:43.152
I love a good cup
of herbal tea.

02:43.288 --> 02:44.619
It's so much more
calming, you know?

02:44.748 --> 02:46.955
I'm here on assignment,
so my nerves
are a little frayed.

02:47.084 --> 02:48.540
Holly.
Did I mention that?

02:48.669 --> 02:50.955
I'm talking too much,
aren't I?
Now it's awkward.

02:51.213 --> 02:52.703
I'm Vincent.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.955
And we have every
herbal tea known to man.

02:55.133 --> 02:56.509
I'll brew you up
something special.

02:56.635 --> 02:58.045
That'd be great.
Thank you.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.588
What were you
listening to?

02:59.721 --> 03:01.097
Oh, nothing good.

03:01.223 --> 03:03.464
Have you heard of
Neuro—Linguistic Programming?

03:03.600 --> 03:06.512
Honey, this is Eureka.
There's nothing
we haven't heard of.

03:06.645 --> 03:08.351
Right. I encoded
some MP3s with it

03:08.480 --> 03:11.267
to help me manage anxiety
around social situations.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.812
It's my own personal
recipe for success.

03:14.861 --> 03:16.067
Joke. Get it?

03:16.196 --> 03:17.902
I get it.
Because you're the chef,

03:18.031 --> 03:19.271
I work with rockets.

03:19.908 --> 03:22.194
You are such a blast.
Do you get that?

03:22.327 --> 03:24.318
I got it! Joke.

03:24.454 --> 03:26.786
I like you.
I like you, too.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.700
What else?

03:29.334 --> 03:32.041
Senator Wen's
representative is due
at 10:00 to conduct

03:32.170 --> 03:34.206
an inquiry into
the FTL accident.

03:34.339 --> 03:37.126
What? No, no, no, no.
They weren't supposed
to be here until next week.

03:37.259 --> 03:39.841
An email just arrived
in your inbox with
the timetable change.

03:39.970 --> 03:42.052
Now I'll be out of a job
sooner than I thought.

03:42.180 --> 03:46.765
Well, you know, you did
take part in a non—sanctioned
launch of an untested...

03:46.893 --> 03:48.178
Not helping, Larry.

03:48.437 --> 03:49.392
Sorry.

03:49.521 --> 03:52.308
So, does our Cylon spy
have a name?

03:52.441 --> 03:53.476
Dr. Holly Marten.

03:53.608 --> 03:57.942
She holds aeronautical
and mechanical engineering
degrees from Cal Poly.

03:58.071 --> 04:01.063
Top of her class,
recruited by numerous
government agencies.

04:01.199 --> 04:02.735
Why do I know her name?

04:02.868 --> 04:05.701
Because Global Dynamics
was one of those agencies.

04:06.037 --> 04:06.901
She said no.

04:07.038 --> 04:09.199
She turned down
a job at G.D.?

04:09.416 --> 04:11.281
That doesn't happen, ever.

04:11.543 --> 04:14.501
According to her files,
she likes to work alone.

04:14.921 --> 04:17.037
Well, happy to
keep it that way.

04:18.425 --> 04:21.041
Time to rock
the game—face play list.

04:21.178 --> 04:22.167
(BEEPING)

04:24.139 --> 04:27.927
Doc, you may be smart
and kind of adorable,

04:28.185 --> 04:30.141
but I won't go down
without a fight.

04:30.437 --> 04:33.520
(EYE OF THE TIGER PLAYING)

04:56.755 --> 04:58.211
(CHUCKLING)

04:59.800 --> 05:01.961
Could you please
not do that
in front of me?

05:02.093 --> 05:03.344
It's traumatizing.

05:03.762 --> 05:05.093
Is it?

05:06.056 --> 05:08.092
Now, are you sure
you can handle this?

05:08.225 --> 05:10.090
Yeah, it's one day.
I can handle it.

05:10.227 --> 05:10.966
All right.

05:11.102 --> 05:13.593
Hey, you know
it's still not too late
to come with me.

05:13.730 --> 05:14.765
You can change
your mind.

05:14.898 --> 05:19.016
Because going to a medical
conference with your mom is
just every teenager's dream.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.437
This is the sarcasm phase.
It's right after
the ignoring phase.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.905
And just before
the loathing phase.
Here you go.

05:26.034 --> 05:27.365
So the best is
yet to come.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.030
Yeah.
That's great.

05:29.162 --> 05:32.871
All right,
so everything you
need is in this bag.

05:33.041 --> 05:36.750
And I had deputy Andy
upgraded with the latest
childcare techniques,

05:36.878 --> 05:38.459
so if you need any
extra help...

05:38.588 --> 05:40.670
Please. I survived
a teenage daughter.

05:40.799 --> 05:42.335
And apart from her
running away
a few dozen times

05:42.467 --> 05:43.707
and a brief stint in jail,

05:43.844 --> 05:45.380
she turned out okay.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.010
Uh,aHnght

05:47.138 --> 05:48.514
Okay.

05:48.765 --> 05:50.676
Okay. Bye, baby.
Say bye.

05:51.768 --> 05:52.757
Hey.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.266
Keep your eye on him.

05:54.396 --> 05:55.636
Got it.

05:56.064 --> 05:57.645
Bye, baby.
Bye.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.230
I'll be back tomorrow.

05:59.442 --> 06:01.182
Say goodbye.

06:01.611 --> 06:03.988
Bye, have a nice trip.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.777
(I MELT WITH YOU PLAYING)

06:13.039 --> 06:16.076
Um, I thought
you hated '80s music.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.449
Well, you know what?

06:17.586 --> 06:22.706
I read somewhere
that marriage is about
compromise.

06:23.091 --> 06:24.080
Uh—huh.

06:24.926 --> 06:27.508
This smells amazing.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.173
What is this all for?

06:30.056 --> 06:32.172
Our anniversary.
Oh.

06:35.729 --> 06:38.971
Uh, is it December
and someone forgot
to tell me?

06:39.107 --> 06:41.143
No, but it's been
six months.

06:42.652 --> 06:44.938
Since you came home.
Uh—huh.

06:45.196 --> 06:47.027
So here

06:48.408 --> 06:50.069
is to my beautiful wife,

06:50.327 --> 06:53.114
a perfect partner
on a perfect morning.

06:59.878 --> 07:02.085
If only every morning
could be like this.

07:03.798 --> 07:05.709
Well, you know, I, uh,

07:06.009 --> 07:08.216
I just had
an idea about that.

07:09.387 --> 07:10.763
Hmm.

07:18.188 --> 07:20.053
Looking good, Lupo.

07:22.067 --> 07:24.399
I meant the new place.

07:25.070 --> 07:28.312
Little small, though.
Didn't know you were
building a Tardis house.

07:29.074 --> 07:30.063
A What?

07:30.200 --> 07:33.567
Big on the inside,
tiny on the...
Never mind.

07:33.912 --> 07:35.118
When do you move in?

07:35.246 --> 07:36.827
Getting the retinal
scans today.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.039
Ah, biometric security.

07:39.668 --> 07:42.580
Got to love the future.
I mean, who needs keys,
right?

07:42.712 --> 07:45.920
It's not like we went
through a wormhole
and got stuck in 1947.

07:48.051 --> 07:49.166
How do you know...

07:51.221 --> 07:55.055
I am going to kill him.

07:56.267 --> 07:57.882
Ow! What was
that for?

07:58.019 --> 08:01.307
You told Zane
about the other timeline.

08:02.023 --> 08:04.480
It may have come up.

08:04.693 --> 08:06.103
I thought we were
going to die.

08:06.236 --> 08:07.897
How much does he know?

08:08.321 --> 08:10.277
That we were stuck
in 1947.

08:10.407 --> 08:12.113
And when we came back
things were different.

08:12.242 --> 08:13.448
Did you tell him
about us?

08:13.576 --> 08:15.362
You mean me and you?

08:16.079 --> 08:17.114
Me and him.

08:17.247 --> 08:19.283
He may have guessed
right a couple times.

08:20.166 --> 08:20.951
Great.

08:21.084 --> 08:22.915
But he knows about
time travel protocols.

08:23.044 --> 08:24.079
He's not going
to give us up.

08:24.212 --> 08:26.043
I don't care
about the stupid
protocols, okay?

08:26.172 --> 08:27.378
I let him go,

08:27.507 --> 08:32.251
and now he's starting
to look at me and that...

08:34.889 --> 08:36.049
Fargo!

08:37.183 --> 08:39.014
Welcome to Global Dynamics,
Dr. Marten.

08:39.144 --> 08:40.554
I'm Douglas Fargo.

08:40.729 --> 08:43.141
Director. Hello.
Um, I'm here to...

08:43.273 --> 08:45.810
See the FTL drive.
Of course. Shall we?

08:46.401 --> 08:48.107
Yeah, that'd be great.
Thanks.

08:48.236 --> 08:51.524
Um, you know, I've been
studying the design
specs and I really...

08:51.656 --> 08:53.442
Do try and keep up.
Okay.

09:00.248 --> 09:01.488
(TYPING)

09:04.669 --> 09:05.704
HOLLY: Whoa.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.788
This is too cool.

09:11.676 --> 09:12.665
Oh.

09:13.053 --> 09:16.841
Oh, I'd love to
take it apart
and see how it works.

09:16.973 --> 09:20.056
When I was a kid,
this one time I reversed
the suction on a vacuum...

09:20.226 --> 09:21.215
Fascinating.

09:21.352 --> 09:23.684
You know, if you want,
I could give you
a demonstration.

09:24.022 --> 09:25.478
I thought it was
non—operational.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.814
I'm the head of G.D.
I can do whatever I want.

09:29.819 --> 09:31.525
(BEEPING)

09:35.033 --> 09:36.523
What's happening?

09:39.704 --> 09:40.864
What did you do?

09:40.997 --> 09:43.204
Got rid of her.
It's for the best.

09:43.374 --> 09:45.160
So, who wants breakfast?

09:45.960 --> 09:47.120
Um.

10:00.183 --> 10:01.673
You FTL'ed
Holly Marten?

10:01.810 --> 10:03.220
The D.O.D. is going to flip.

10:03.353 --> 10:04.718
She wanted to take it apart.

10:04.854 --> 10:05.889
She would have
realized the design

10:06.022 --> 10:07.228
is based on
the Einstein Bridge...

10:07.357 --> 10:10.019
And then...
The secret's out.

10:10.151 --> 10:12.984
Now you care about
keeping secrets?

10:13.113 --> 10:15.479
What the hell
is wrong with you?

10:15.865 --> 10:17.321
I feel fine.

10:18.201 --> 10:21.068
Fargo, where is Holly?

10:21.871 --> 10:22.860
Beats me.

10:24.124 --> 10:27.491
She could be anywhere.
Or nowhere.

10:29.003 --> 10:30.868
So, waffles?

10:32.966 --> 10:35.378
(CARTER SPEAKING QUIETLY)

10:37.595 --> 10:39.131
This sucks, man.

10:39.973 --> 10:40.962
You said you wanted
to hang out

10:41.099 --> 10:42.054
like we used to, right?

10:42.183 --> 10:43.343
Yeah, like when you
used to take me out

10:43.476 --> 10:44.636
on investigations
and stuff.

10:44.769 --> 10:47.636
I never took you
out on... Uh, uh.

10:48.314 --> 10:51.898
Except when I did.
Then we did.

10:52.026 --> 10:53.562
Ever since you
and mom got together,

10:53.695 --> 10:55.435
we don't have any fun.

10:56.030 --> 10:58.316
You're all domesticated.

10:58.449 --> 10:59.859
I'm not...

11:01.828 --> 11:03.113
Domesticated.

11:03.746 --> 11:04.826
I'm...

11:05.623 --> 11:07.238
(PHONE BEEPING)
Yeah.

11:07.375 --> 11:08.990
Oh, shoot.

11:09.294 --> 11:10.659
Come on.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.086
Hey, Jo. I'm on a day off.

11:13.256 --> 11:14.371
Can you call Andy?

11:15.258 --> 11:16.498
Fargo did what?

11:16.885 --> 11:17.874
Do we have a case?

11:18.011 --> 11:19.797
(SHUSHING)
I could help you.

11:20.597 --> 11:22.053
Okay, keep me posted.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.465
Hypothetically,

11:26.269 --> 11:29.352
what if there was
an accident with the FTL?

11:29.480 --> 11:32.096
And someone got
sent somewhere?

11:32.233 --> 11:33.268
You mean someone got zapped?

11:33.401 --> 11:35.187
Hypothetically.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.402
Well, they might be
at the BCE site.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.940
You know,
the Bosun Cloud Exciter?

11:39.073 --> 11:40.859
Yeah, the catcher's mitt.
I remember.

11:40.992 --> 11:43.233
But if the coordinates
of the BCE were
the last ones in the drive,

11:43.369 --> 11:44.905
the FTL might have
sent them there.

11:45.121 --> 11:47.362
We should go!
No, no, no, hey, hey.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.081
No.

11:51.711 --> 11:54.418
But it's a good idea,
and I will let Jo know.

11:55.089 --> 11:57.580
Sheriff, your order is ready.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.007
What's the occasion?
Big party later.

12:00.136 --> 12:02.297
Getting started
a bit early,
don't you think?

12:02.430 --> 12:05.217
Oh, it's never too early
to par—tay.

12:06.851 --> 12:07.840
That's good.

12:10.647 --> 12:11.636
(COOING)

12:11.773 --> 12:13.388
You might be the...

12:13.566 --> 12:14.646
(CAR STARTING)

12:15.652 --> 12:16.812
Oh!

12:17.195 --> 12:18.810
Kevin!

12:19.697 --> 12:21.073
Kevin!

12:27.121 --> 12:28.736
(CAR SCREECHING)

12:41.052 --> 12:42.167
And he just took off?

12:42.303 --> 12:45.921
Yeah, he's on some sort
of crime fighting kick.

12:46.057 --> 12:48.093
I guess old timeline me
used to take him
on ride—alongs.

12:48.226 --> 12:51.263
That is so cute.
He wants to be
your little deputy.

12:51.396 --> 12:52.636
Jo, he stole myjeep.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.184
Yes, well,
there's that.

12:55.316 --> 12:56.396
Dr. Marten!

12:56.651 --> 12:57.811
Kevin!

12:59.195 --> 13:03.108
And Fargo, he what?
Just disappeared her?

13:03.700 --> 13:06.032
Yeah, he claims
he was protecting us.

13:06.160 --> 13:09.744
I don't know.
This Holly chick
has him acting crazy.

13:09.872 --> 13:10.952
Well, crazier.

13:11.082 --> 13:12.947
Ah, he's scared
for his job.

13:13.084 --> 13:15.746
I mean you don't act rational
when you're freaked out.

13:15.878 --> 13:19.166
Okay, there's irrational
and then there's homicidal.

13:19.382 --> 13:22.169
You didn't see his face.
It was...

13:22.468 --> 13:23.844
It was like
he didn't care.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.961
Jack! Jack!
I found her!

13:26.973 --> 13:28.053
Dr. Marten.

13:28.182 --> 13:29.592
Global Dynamics
is not that way.

13:29.726 --> 13:31.091
Are you okay?
Are you kidding?

13:31.602 --> 13:33.467
That was amazing.

13:33.688 --> 13:36.350
The first direct FTL flight
of a vehicle—less life form.

13:36.482 --> 13:38.393
Oh, I can't wait
to tell everyone I know.

13:38.526 --> 13:39.732
Not that I know
that a lot of people.

13:39.861 --> 13:40.976
I'll have to write a paper.

13:41.112 --> 13:42.943
Maybe I'll call it
Beam Me Up,

13:43.072 --> 13:45.233
or something less dated
and more irreverent.

13:45.491 --> 13:47.607
Oh, hi, I'm Holly.
Hi. I'm Jack.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.196
Can I go again?

13:49.412 --> 13:51.994
Well, we can talk
about that at G.D.

13:52.123 --> 13:52.908
when we get
you checked out.

13:53.041 --> 13:54.121
Okay. Bye.

13:57.211 --> 13:58.462
Okay, look, I know
you're probably mad...

13:58.588 --> 14:00.124
Do you think?

14:00.715 --> 14:02.501
(PHONE RINGING)

14:05.553 --> 14:07.464
Oh, come on, Jack!
Please don't do it.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.007
Who's your best friend?
She is.

14:09.140 --> 14:10.220
Hey, Allison.

14:10.350 --> 14:14.093
Hey, yourself.
Everything okay?
How are my babies?

14:14.270 --> 14:19.060
CARTER: (STAMMERING)
Well, Kevin just...

14:21.069 --> 14:23.731
Uh, found something
for me that I lost.

14:24.072 --> 14:26.154
Yeah!
Oh! That's good.

14:27.116 --> 14:29.698
Carter?
You know what?
I'm losing you.

14:29.827 --> 14:31.818
I'll call you
when I get
to the hotel.

14:31.954 --> 14:33.569
Okay, sounds good.
Miss you.

14:33.790 --> 14:36.156
I miss you, too.
Hello?

14:36.334 --> 14:37.323
(LOUD BANG)

14:37.460 --> 14:38.666
Whoa!

14:46.135 --> 14:47.545
Oh, my God.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.096
Hey! Are you all right?
(SOBBING)

14:53.810 --> 14:57.644
Oh, thank God.
He's trapped down there.

14:57.814 --> 15:00.977
He was in front of me
and just lost control, and...

15:01.109 --> 15:02.895
I know.
I drove over
the same debris.

15:03.027 --> 15:05.769
I tried calling for help,
but I can't get a signal.

15:06.447 --> 15:07.857
What do I do?

15:07.990 --> 15:10.527
Please.
You have to help me.
That's my dad.

15:10.660 --> 15:13.242
One second, honey.
It'll be okay.
I'm a doctor.

15:16.374 --> 15:18.535
(EXCLAIMS |N PAIN)

15:19.252 --> 15:20.833
Are you okay?

15:20.962 --> 15:24.420
Yeah, I'm fine.
Just watch out
for passing cars, okay?

15:32.557 --> 15:33.922
Where's Fargo?

15:34.058 --> 15:35.434
Resting comfortably
in your office.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.221
You locked him
in my holding cell?

15:37.353 --> 15:40.060
You'd rather he roam free
while Red here is sniffing
around the FTL?

15:40.815 --> 15:42.521
Who knows what
he'll do next.

15:43.067 --> 15:45.103
I have to call the senator
and let her know
what's going on.

15:45.236 --> 15:46.897
This is going
to blow her mind.

15:47.029 --> 15:49.020
Have you seen Dr. Fargo?
I want to thank him.

15:49.157 --> 15:50.146
For?

15:50.283 --> 15:52.365
For the...
The demonstration.

15:52.493 --> 15:55.485
To be honest,
I don't do a lot
of work in the field.

15:55.621 --> 15:57.998
Really?
So this has been
a real education.

15:58.124 --> 16:01.036
I did my thesis
on Einstein's field
equaﬂons,andu.

16:01.210 --> 16:02.825
Are you familiar with
the Gauss—Bonnet theory,

16:02.962 --> 16:04.793
which posits that
exotic matter need
not be present

16:04.922 --> 16:07.664
to superluminally traverse
two points in space time?

16:08.468 --> 16:10.424
Must have been
sick that day.

16:10.761 --> 16:13.468
Speaking of which,
we should probably get you
checked out by the docs.

16:13.598 --> 16:16.681
It's a standard procedure
for superluminous travel.

16:16.893 --> 16:17.928
Right. Of course.

16:18.060 --> 16:19.015
Let me show you
to the...

16:19.145 --> 16:20.476
Infirmary? I know the way.

16:20.605 --> 16:22.311
I memorized the blueprints
on the plane.

16:23.441 --> 16:24.897
Of course you did.

16:25.651 --> 16:26.686
What?

16:26.819 --> 16:29.401
There might be a way
to disguise the origins
of the FTL,

16:29.530 --> 16:32.522
keep her from figuring out
that it's a spinoff
of the Bridge device.

16:33.201 --> 16:34.987
Great. Do it.

16:35.286 --> 16:38.949
How about some
quid pro quo?

16:39.081 --> 16:41.538
I'm at a bit of
a disadvantage here, Jo.

16:41.667 --> 16:44.124
We used to be intimate.
I...

16:44.253 --> 16:47.791
And you've seen me naked.
I'm just saying
it's only fair.

16:48.925 --> 16:51.007
I am not playing
games with you.

16:52.136 --> 16:54.969
Come on, Jo.
We have to deal
with this.

16:55.097 --> 16:57.053
No, we don't.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.515
We don't exist.

17:00.394 --> 17:04.182
Not in this
or any timeline.

17:13.616 --> 17:15.902
ANDY: Oh, there's
Sheriff Carter and your
big brother Kevin.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.946
He just perpetrated
a code 503.

17:18.079 --> 17:20.695
That's grand theft auto.
Yes, it is.

17:20.998 --> 17:23.375
Sit. Sorry I stuck you
with babysitting duty.

17:23.501 --> 17:25.867
No problem.
It was kind of
nice, actually.

17:26.003 --> 17:27.914
Did you find Miss Marten?
Uh, yeah, we did.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.287
Well, he did.

17:29.423 --> 17:31.960
I don't know how or why,
but he did.

17:32.093 --> 17:34.004
I don't know.
I had to.

17:34.136 --> 17:35.967
I knew where she was
and I wanted to help.

17:36.097 --> 17:38.053
Well, if you're
still in the mood,
I could use some help.

17:38.182 --> 17:39.797
Really?
Yeah.

17:39.934 --> 17:41.390
What's going on?
Is there like
a nanobot outbreak?

17:41.519 --> 17:42.975
Did a quantum window
open up somewhere?

17:43.104 --> 17:45.641
Nope. You can hold Jenna
while I answer the phone.

17:46.148 --> 17:46.898
It's not ringing.

17:47.024 --> 17:49.185
I set the ring to
an infrasonic frequency.

17:49.318 --> 17:51.695
Jenna's been napping.
It's been kind of crazy.

17:51.821 --> 17:53.357
Sheriff's office.
Hold please.

17:53.489 --> 17:54.899
I could use
another hand, though.

17:55.032 --> 17:58.274
Order one.
Today you're putting
out the fires.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.821
Watch him.
Deputy Andy.

17:59.954 --> 18:01.114
How may I be
of assistance?

18:01.247 --> 18:03.033
It's Jo.
ls Carter around?

18:03.374 --> 18:05.114
Uh, he's indisposed
right now.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.912
Can you just let him know
that I'm going
by my house

18:08.045 --> 18:12.004
and I've got everything
under control.

18:12.133 --> 18:13.122
I'll do that.

18:24.270 --> 18:27.433
My house. My new house.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.076
Oh, hey, Jo.

19:02.892 --> 19:05.884
Just give me one reason
why I shouldn't shoot you.

19:06.020 --> 19:08.136
Oh, come on.
We can talk
about this.

19:08.439 --> 19:10.896
You burned down my house!

19:11.025 --> 19:13.732
Okay, we are
way past talking.

19:14.195 --> 19:15.526
Well, maybe
if you listened.

19:16.572 --> 19:19.985
Uh, this is revenge?
For what? Not getting naked?

19:20.201 --> 19:21.111
Maybe.

19:21.243 --> 19:23.985
Okay, that's enough.
You, I'll let you out of there
when you calm down.

19:24.121 --> 19:25.452
You, sit.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.409
Now, what's going on?

19:33.005 --> 19:37.044
She was ignoring me.
I tried to talk
to her about us.

19:38.386 --> 19:39.922
(WHISPERING) The other US.

19:40.054 --> 19:41.134
What's he talking about?

19:41.263 --> 19:43.219
Nothing.

19:45.976 --> 19:48.467
We're telling
everybody now?
Fargo told him.

19:48.938 --> 19:50.678
Fargo?
Uh—huh.

19:54.985 --> 19:56.316
Maybe that's it.

19:56.862 --> 19:59.979
"It" what?
What Fargo did to...
What's—her—name?

20:00.116 --> 20:01.777
Holly.
Yeah, uh, now
Zane's gone postal.

20:01.909 --> 20:03.445
What do they
have in common?

20:03.828 --> 20:05.159
They're both idiots?

20:05.287 --> 20:08.450
The FTL flight.
They were in
the capsule together.

20:09.375 --> 20:12.037
Oh, you think that
it may have altered
them somehow?

20:12.169 --> 20:14.160
Well, no one's ever
used Faster than Light
technology before.

20:14.296 --> 20:15.957
It's got to have
some side effects.

20:16.090 --> 20:17.796
There's nothing
wrong with me.

20:19.468 --> 20:23.677
You set Jo's house on fire
to get her attention.

20:24.932 --> 20:26.433
Okay, I see your point.

20:26.559 --> 20:29.426
Okay. We're going
to get you and Fargo
checked out at G.D.

20:29.645 --> 20:30.930
Finally, some action!

20:31.063 --> 20:35.352
We. Not "we."
You're not going anywhere.

20:35.484 --> 20:37.861
Well, I can take Zane.

20:38.779 --> 20:40.644
I won't kill him.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.735
Promise.
That's reassuring.

20:45.202 --> 20:47.909
So, does this mean
we finally get to talk?

20:48.038 --> 20:49.027
Go.

20:49.206 --> 20:53.666
Oh, and now Zane
has to watch over
Jo committing a 187

20:53.794 --> 20:57.082
after he 10—71'd
her house. Yes.

20:58.299 --> 21:00.915
Oh, this is the best idea
you ever had.

21:01.051 --> 21:01.961
And you inspired it.

21:02.178 --> 21:03.964
Hand me the laser torch,
would you?

21:04.096 --> 21:07.179
Well, hey, wait don't...
Don't you want to use
the F crumper on it?

21:08.392 --> 21:10.223
You don't think so?
Okay.

21:10.644 --> 21:12.930
All right.
Give it to me. Okay.

21:13.564 --> 21:14.553
(WHIRRING)

21:14.690 --> 21:15.679
Uh—huh.

21:17.193 --> 21:18.478
Told you.

21:18.611 --> 21:21.478
Well, you know itjust...
It was a test.
Uh—huh.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.070
(PHONE RINGING)

21:24.992 --> 21:26.323
It's Jack.

21:26.535 --> 21:28.947
Well, it'll have to wait.
Uh—huh.

21:31.373 --> 21:32.909
Okay, so here.
Right there?

21:33.042 --> 21:34.031
Right there.
Yep.

21:39.840 --> 21:40.920
Is he okay?

21:41.175 --> 21:42.665
ALLISON: He's not here.

21:43.594 --> 21:46.961
There's a small silver case
in the glove compartment.
Bring it to me.

21:47.097 --> 21:48.712
Be careful.

21:52.728 --> 21:55.435
Dr. Marten,
we are sorry for this.

21:55.773 --> 21:57.638
You think what's happened
to them will happen to me?

21:57.775 --> 22:00.892
Because if the FTL
travel altered their
brain chemistry in some way,

22:01.028 --> 22:02.984
that means it'll
change me too, right?

22:03.614 --> 22:05.150
Obviously I don't
know that for sure.

22:05.282 --> 22:06.692
I'm only a rocket scientist.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.862
Don't trust her, Jo!
She's working against us.

22:08.994 --> 22:09.858
You have to
get rid of her!

answering his phone.

22:25.594 --> 22:26.629
We're headed over
the garage now.

22:26.762 --> 22:27.922
How are things over there?

22:28.055 --> 22:29.886
Well, Fargo and Zane
are out of commission

22:30.015 --> 22:31.971
and the only person
who knows anything
about the FTL

22:32.101 --> 22:34.217
is the one person
we can't ask.

22:34.353 --> 22:37.345
Look, Henry needs to check
it out before things
get any weirder around here.

22:37.481 --> 22:38.937
I'll find him.

22:56.917 --> 22:58.953
Well, things
just got weirder.

23:13.058 --> 23:14.969
Hi! You're not Jo.

23:15.102 --> 23:16.933
No. I'm Holly.
We met earlier.

23:17.062 --> 23:19.223
I'm not surprised
you don't remember.
I remember.

23:19.356 --> 23:21.221

She's busy herding dogs.

No. No. Not "hurting."

Yeah.

Someone let all the dogs
out of the behavioral
science lab,

23:29.116 --> 23:30.526
which I totally get.

23:30.659 --> 23:32.775
I mean, yes, research
requires test subjects

23:32.912 --> 23:34.448
and no, they aren't
being harmed,

cooped up in there and...

Uh, so what is it?

23:42.546 --> 23:44.252
HOLLY: It's a landslide,
but the rocks aren't moving.

23:44.381 --> 23:45.791
Must be some
kind of stasis field.

23:45.925 --> 23:46.880
Stasis field?

23:47.009 --> 23:49.876

bubble in time?

23:50.012 --> 23:51.798
Well, it only looks
like time has stopped.

23:51.931 --> 23:53.887
Stopping time would violate
the Uncertainty Principle.

23:54.016 --> 23:57.383

only at a rate imperceptible
to the naked eye.

have a head injury

The song gave you
a way to do that.

If the region were
hyper—activated due to
frequency progressions

30:47.054 --> 30:48.214

it would explain

why you felt compelled
to act on the lyrics.

Well, the jukebox wirelessly
downloads all music files
from any outside source.

31:11.953 --> 31:15.116
It could've embedded
the hypnotic programming
into all the music files.

Can you reverse it?

31:21.630 --> 31:22.745
Maybe. Probably.

I would have to adjust
the pitch frequencies

can you do it or not?

Yes.

the person who
created the field

31:39.022 --> 31:40.137
and get them to stop it.

31:40.273 --> 31:41.979

What if you get caught
in the field?

32:16.059 --> 32:17.674
I'll manage. Okay?

Okay, not to rush you,
but we kind of got
to get out of here.

32:26.903 --> 32:28.859
If you guys know how
to retune Neuro—Linguistic
Frequencies

32:28.989 --> 32:29.819
using acoustic algorithms

32:29.948 --> 32:30.903
then by all means,
assist.

32:31.032 --> 32:33.318
Yeah, of course
we know how to...

32:34.995 --> 32:36.360
Whatever.

32:39.249 --> 32:41.490
All right. Uploading
the cure for player.

32:41.626 --> 32:44.083
Ah, got it.
Let's go fix Henry.

32:46.173 --> 32:47.458
Wait!

33:02.439 --> 33:03.428
Wait.

33:06.943 --> 33:09.104
We're trapped!
What do we do now?

33:13.909 --> 33:14.898
No, Jack, wait!

33:15.035 --> 33:16.491
Whoa, easy there,
little fellow.

33:16.620 --> 33:17.575
You heard what
the sheriff said.

33:17.704 --> 33:18.910
I have to get you
and your sister to safety.

33:19.039 --> 33:20.779
Look, you don't understand.
He's in danger.

33:21.082 --> 33:21.946
From the stasis field?

33:22.083 --> 33:23.584
From Bob Marley!

(| SHOT THE SHERIFF PLAYING)

33:24.836 --> 33:26.622
I shot the sheriff

33:26.755 --> 33:30.213
But I didn't shoot the deputy

33:30.550 --> 33:32.836
Oh no
Oh no

33:33.428 --> 33:36.044
I shot the sheriff

33:36.806 --> 33:40.173
But I didn't shoot the deputy

33:40.685 --> 33:42.937
Ooh ooh

33:43.104 --> 33:47.313
Yeah all around
in my hometown

33:48.693 --> 33:52.026
They're trying
to track me down

33:53.782 --> 33:57.115
They say they want to
bring me in guilty

33:58.245 --> 33:59.360
You okay?

34:03.083 --> 34:06.871
For the life of a deputy

34:08.129 --> 34:09.665
But I say

(GUN COCKING)

34:12.968 --> 34:15.710
If I'm guilty I will pay

34:16.096 --> 34:17.256
What are you doing?

34:18.014 --> 34:21.051
I shot the sheriff

34:21.184 --> 34:24.301
But I swear it
was in self defense

34:26.565 --> 34:27.930
I shot the sheriff

34:28.358 --> 34:29.438
What are you doing?

34:29.568 --> 34:33.186
And they say
it is a capital offense

34:41.538 --> 34:43.028
KEVIN: Jo!

34:43.248 --> 34:44.863
Look, you don't
have to do this!

34:45.000 --> 34:46.991
Yes, I do.

34:47.127 --> 34:49.914
He put the uniform on.
Why did he put
the uniform on?

34:50.046 --> 34:51.582
Jo, this isn't you.

34:51.715 --> 34:53.125
It's the music
that's making you do this.

34:53.258 --> 34:54.998
Please, we're running
out of time.

34:55.135 --> 34:57.000
Just hand me the gun.

34:57.137 --> 34:58.752
I can't.
He's the sheriff.

34:58.888 --> 35:00.753
The device that's causing
the stasis field
is in the garage.

35:00.890 --> 35:01.925
We have to shut it off.

35:02.058 --> 35:03.343
I'll be right here.

35:03.476 --> 35:05.853
Ifl cut off the field
the bullet will kill him.

35:06.229 --> 35:08.311
Jo, please,
you don't want to do this.
He's your friend.

35:10.859 --> 35:12.395
He's your friend.

35:12.944 --> 35:16.061
Look, I can fix this
I just need to find
the right song.

Look, we can
still save him.

35:36.968 --> 35:39.084
We just have to
time it perfectly.

Why can't we be friends?

Ready!

better like this.

You. This is
your fault.

36:36.528 --> 36:37.984
No, no, no.

36:38.113 --> 36:40.229
I think we should
try out that cure
of yours now.

36:40.365 --> 36:41.946
Yeah.
Yeah.

Oh. I'm sorry.
I tried to kill you.

37:10.437 --> 37:13.895
I think I can
forgive you. Come on.

37:17.068 --> 37:18.353
Thanks.

37:19.654 --> 37:22.236
It was the least
that I could do.

37:23.199 --> 37:25.235
But I'm not the one
that you should thank.

37:27.036 --> 37:27.991
Jack!

37:28.121 --> 37:30.077
I told you I could help.

37:33.209 --> 37:34.324
Nice job, Deputy.

37:40.884 --> 37:42.499
If it wasn't for
your stupid
self—help tapes

37:42.635 --> 37:43.920
none of us would
be in this mess.

37:44.053 --> 37:45.509
I hope you're going
to put that in your report.

37:45.638 --> 37:47.253
Okay. First of all,
tapes?

37:47.390 --> 37:49.005
Are we living in 1982?

37:49.184 --> 37:50.549
Second, what report?

37:50.685 --> 37:52.892
The report you're
sending back
to Senator Wen.

37:53.021 --> 37:54.352
About the accident.

37:54.481 --> 37:55.971
I'm not filing a report.

Admit it,

becomes final.

38:08.661 --> 38:09.696

38:09.829 --> 38:12.411
The $20 billion you're
getting to build
an FTL—powered spacecraft

38:12.540 --> 38:14.121
capable of reaching Titan.

38:15.877 --> 38:17.367

I was here.

a little bit more helpful
through all of this.

from me, Zane?

to see me naked?

I want to know
what we were.

Although I'm not opposed
to the whole naked thing.

41:21.854 --> 41:23.936

a joke to you.

something to
each other before

41:25.775 --> 41:27.857
maybe we're supposed
to be something
to each other now.

41:27.986 --> 41:29.021
We're not.
