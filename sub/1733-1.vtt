<i>If you have a fever and cough
or sore throat...</i>

01:04.464 --> 01:05.897
<i>stay home.</i>

01:06.066 --> 01:09.126
<i>I'd say 95% chance this is manufactured.
Came out of a laboratory.</i>

01:09.302 --> 01:10.997
<i>The source of the virus was traced back...</i>

01:11.171 --> 01:14.436
<i>to drug testing done at
Gen-Sys Laboratories in San Francisco.</i>

01:14.607 --> 01:16.825
<i>The lab technician now known
as Patient Zero...</i>

01:17.010 --> 01:20.730
<i>was accidentally exposed to
retrovirus ALZ-113...</i>

01:20.914 --> 01:23.633
<i>an Alzheimer's trial drug
that was being tested on chimpanzees.</i>

01:23.817 --> 01:26.934
<i>The infected chimps showed signs
of erratic and aggressive behavior...</i>

01:27.120 --> 01:28.906
<i>that led to their escape from the facility.</i>

01:29.089 --> 01:31.273
<i>The now-famous incident
on the Golden Gate Bridge...</i>

01:31.458 --> 01:33.346
<i>a six-hour standoff with police...</i>

01:33.526 --> 01:36.006
<i>ended with the apes disappearing
into Muir woods.</i>

01:36.196 --> 01:39.757
<i>Emergency rooms are being overwhelmed
with patients showing signs...</i>

01:39.933 --> 01:41.696
<i>of what's being dubbed
"The Simian Flu."</i>

01:41.868 --> 01:44.018
<i>The CDC is projecting a fatality toll...</i>

01:44.204 --> 01:47.526
<i>ranging from 5 million
to as many as 150 million...</i>

01:47.707 --> 01:48.924
<i>in the next 6 to 8 months.</i>

01:49.109 --> 01:53.466
<i>Anyone showing signs of a contagious illness
will receive special treatment here...</i>

01:53.646 --> 01:56.103
<i>the airport's purpose-built
quarantine center.</i>

01:56.282 --> 02:00.207
<i>Many of the new arrivals are children
who have lost contact with their parents.</i>

02:00.386 --> 02:02.843
<i>The mandatory quarantines
have sparked civil unrest.</i>

02:03.022 --> 02:04.876
<i>Families are being ripped apart.</i>

02:05.058 --> 02:06.548
<i>Containment is not very likely.</i>

02:06.726 --> 02:09.320
<i>Prepare your families.
Know your evacuation route.</i>

02:09.496 --> 02:12.886
<i>The survival rate is now
approximately 1 in 500.</i>

02:13.066 --> 02:15.125
<i>Violence erupted in the city center tonight.</i>

02:15.301 --> 02:16.701
<i>The third incident in as many days.</i>

02:16.803 --> 02:19.192
<i>Martial law has been declared in 28 nations...</i>

02:19.372 --> 02:21.067
<i>including the U.S. and Canada.</i>

02:21.241 --> 02:23.721
<i>The reactor is overheating.
We can't stop a meltdown.</i>

02:24.511 --> 02:28.743
<i>Just a total collapse of anything
resembling civilian order.</i>

02:28.915 --> 02:31.338
<i>Due to the extremity of the
Simian Flu crisis...</i>

02:31.518 --> 02:35.238
<i>all regular government functions
have been suspended indefinitely.</i>

02:37.357 --> 02:40.417
<i>Those who aren't killed by the virus...</i>

02:40.593 --> 02:42.413
<i>will probably die in the fighting.</i>

02:43.563 --> 02:46.646
<i>So, maybe this is it.</i>

02:46.833 --> 02:48.858
<i>This is how it ends.</i>

02:49.035 --> 02:50.559
<i>Pretty soon...</i>

02:51.771 --> 02:53.705
<i>there won't be anyone left.</i>

03:59.405 --> 04:00.531
Caesar...

04:00.807 --> 04:02.206
They are close.

04:04.877 --> 04:06.731
Koba!

04:26.799 --> 04:28.824
Now, father?

05:32.165 --> 05:34.861
Son, stay...

06:51.711 --> 06:53.929
Thank you, Koba.

07:15.802 --> 07:18.623
Think before you act, son.

08:23.202 --> 08:25.261
Don't feel bad, Blue Eyes...

08:28.674 --> 08:31.700
Scars make you strong.

10:48.681 --> 10:51.798
Come meet your new brother.

11:07.833 --> 11:09.198
Another son.

11:13.773 --> 11:17.903
Makes me think how far we've come,
Maurice.

11:20.946 --> 11:24.871
Seems long ago.

11:28.487 --> 11:31.115
Still think about them?

11:31.991 --> 11:33.538
Humans?

11:36.495 --> 11:37.985
Sometimes.

11:41.033 --> 11:43.729
Didn't know them like you did.

11:44.904 --> 11:48.328
Only saw their bad side.

11:49.041 --> 11:53.091
Good, bad... doesn't matter now.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.898
Humans destroyed each other.

11:57.850 --> 11:59.818
Apes fight too.

12:00.586 --> 12:02.736
But we are family.

12:09.061 --> 12:12.861
Wonder if they're really all gone.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.314
Ten winters now...

12:15.434 --> 12:19.086
Last two... no sign of them.

12:20.172 --> 12:22.140
They must be gone.

12:53.973 --> 12:56.874
That bear wouldn't get me Blue Eyes. I'm quick!

12:57.276 --> 12:59.062
Shut up, Ash!

13:10.422 --> 13:11.548
Oh, God.

13:12.091 --> 13:13.422
It's okay.

13:24.503 --> 13:27.131
It's okay. It's okay.

13:27.673 --> 13:28.321
Freeze!

13:43.689 --> 13:44.667
Stay!

13:44.857 --> 13:46.108
Help!

13:46.792 --> 13:48.282
Help!

13:48.460 --> 13:49.438
No!

13:50.396 --> 13:51.795
Hey!

13:52.865 --> 13:54.355
Over here!

13:56.368 --> 13:59.235
I shot him! I shot him.

14:31.003 --> 14:33.904
They shot Ash! Shot my son!

14:34.773 --> 14:37.071
Rocket, wait...

14:43.048 --> 14:45.027
We don't mean any harm!

14:45.217 --> 14:49.085
They're apes, man. You think
they understand what you're saying?

14:50.356 --> 14:52.119
Do they look like just apes to you?

15:05.771 --> 15:06.624
Dad.

15:06.805 --> 15:07.635
Malcolm, what are you doing?

15:07.806 --> 15:09.023
- Dad?
- Malcolm.

15:09.208 --> 15:10.266
It's okay.

15:15.614 --> 15:17.309
Put your guns down.

15:17.483 --> 15:19.269
- You can't be serious.
- Do it.

15:28.894 --> 15:30.111
Go!

15:32.097 --> 15:33.052
Holy shit.

15:33.232 --> 15:34.210
Holy shit.

15:36.835 --> 15:39.315
Okay. Okay, we're going.

15:39.505 --> 15:40.836
Go!

15:41.006 --> 15:42.587
Slowly.
Go, go, go!

15:46.812 --> 15:48.063
My bag!

15:48.247 --> 15:49.225
Go!

16:09.935 --> 16:11.095
Koba!

16:13.072 --> 16:14.255
Follow!

17:00.085 --> 17:01.268
Did you find it?

17:02.154 --> 17:03.701
We need to talk.

17:03.989 --> 17:06.776
What? What's wrong?

17:08.761 --> 17:10.046
The dam is pretty much intact.

17:10.229 --> 17:12.163
It could probably start generating
power for us within a week.

17:12.664 --> 17:14.757
But there is a problem. Get in.

17:26.377 --> 17:27.538
I shot him.

17:28.180 --> 17:29.700
I was scared.
I didn't know what to do.

17:29.715 --> 17:32.707
Jesus Christ.
How many were there?

17:32.885 --> 17:33.943
A lot. Like, 80.

17:34.119 --> 17:35.279
- At least.
- Okay...

17:35.454 --> 17:39.208
you're not hearing what he's saying.
They spoke!

17:39.391 --> 17:40.824
That is not possible.

17:40.993 --> 17:42.847
I'm telling you, Dreyfus,
they did and it was incredible.

17:43.028 --> 17:45.724
Incredible? They're talking apes!

17:45.898 --> 17:47.877
- With big-ass spears!
- Please!

17:48.067 --> 17:51.867
I don't know exactly what you think
you saw or heard...

17:52.571 --> 17:54.539
but you have to calm down, okay?

17:54.873 --> 17:57.808
What about the virus, Ellie?
Any chance of contagion?

17:57.976 --> 18:01.127
We're all genetically immune
or we would've been dead a long time ago.

18:01.313 --> 18:02.530
You don't know that for sure.

18:02.714 --> 18:04.074
She worked with the CDC.
She knows.

18:04.183 --> 18:05.023
What are we gonna do?

18:05.150 --> 18:06.845
I don't know.

18:07.186 --> 18:08.881
We need that power.

18:09.054 --> 18:11.022
He could've killed us, but he didn't.

18:11.190 --> 18:13.704
Maybe he kept us alive,
so they could follow us.

18:13.892 --> 18:16.861
They find out where we are,
and they kill us all!

18:17.029 --> 18:18.280
What do you mean, "he"?

18:18.397 --> 18:20.012
That's what we're trying to tell you.

18:20.199 --> 18:22.986
It was unlike anything you've
ever seen before, and the leader...

18:24.470 --> 18:25.630
He was remarkable.

18:25.904 --> 18:26.882
Really?

18:27.306 --> 18:29.146
- Is that what you thought?
- It's what we saw.

18:29.174 --> 18:30.357
Yeah, it's what we all saw.

18:30.542 --> 18:32.806
Not a word of this back at the colony,
you understand me?

18:32.978 --> 18:34.778
Not a word
until we can figure out what to do.

18:34.913 --> 18:37.393
- You gotta be kidding.
- No, I'm not kidding.

18:38.750 --> 18:40.900
I don't want to create a panic.

18:59.404 --> 19:01.372
How are you doing, pal?
Are you okay?

19:01.707 --> 19:03.561
- I dropped my bag.
- I know.

19:03.742 --> 19:05.721
- Was your sketchbook in there?
- It's gone.

19:06.011 --> 19:09.094
Carver just told me we're not gonna tell
anybody what happened up there.

19:09.281 --> 19:10.942
Not yet. No.

19:38.310 --> 19:39.925
Must attack them now!

19:40.245 --> 19:42.133
Before they attack us!

19:42.881 --> 19:44.849
We don't know how many there are.

19:45.217 --> 19:47.333
How many guns they have?

19:48.420 --> 19:51.446
Or why they came up here?

19:58.530 --> 20:01.351
They shot your son, Rocket!

20:01.900 --> 20:03.333
Don't you want to fight?

20:04.536 --> 20:07.323
I follow Caesar.

20:09.374 --> 20:10.864
Koba's right!

20:12.611 --> 20:14.829
They almost killed you, Ash!

20:19.751 --> 20:21.241
No!

20:26.391 --> 20:28.780
If we go to war...

20:29.027 --> 20:32.622
We could lose all we've built...

20:34.566 --> 20:36.386
Home.

20:39.137 --> 20:40.957
Family.

20:49.014 --> 20:50.595
Future.

20:57.222 --> 21:00.214
I will decide by morning.

21:11.803 --> 21:12.781
Caesar.

21:19.311 --> 21:22.280
For years I was a prisoner in their lab...

21:22.814 --> 21:24.270
They cut me...

21:24.483 --> 21:25.700
Tortured me.

21:27.919 --> 21:29.705
You freed me.

21:31.923 --> 21:34.016
I would do anything you ask.

21:37.095 --> 21:38.881
But we must show strength!

21:41.433 --> 21:43.856
We will, Koba.

22:25.210 --> 22:28.862
Coming through. Coming through.

22:49.434 --> 22:52.301
That's a hell of a lot more than eighty!

23:20.365 --> 23:22.151
Malcolm!

23:53.365 --> 23:54.730
Apes...

23:56.568 --> 24:00.652
do not want war...

24:01.373 --> 24:04.672
but will fight...

24:05.710 --> 24:08.793
if we must.

24:40.545 --> 24:43.605
Ape home.

24:45.083 --> 24:49.372
Human home.

24:54.125 --> 24:57.185
Do not come back.

25:37.002 --> 25:38.435
Everyone!

25:39.838 --> 25:43.103
Everyone, you have to calm down!

25:49.848 --> 25:51.816
Everybody.

25:52.450 --> 25:54.429
Everybody!

25:54.619 --> 25:58.271
Please! We're all immune!

25:58.456 --> 26:02.859
We're all immune,
or we wouldn't still be here!

26:03.028 --> 26:04.484
How did they find us?

26:05.997 --> 26:06.918
We found them.

26:07.098 --> 26:09.487
- You knew they were out there!
- What if they come back?

26:09.668 --> 26:11.431
Yeah!

26:11.603 --> 26:14.265
If they come back...
If they come back...

26:14.439 --> 26:17.499
they'll be sorry they ever did!

26:18.176 --> 26:20.599
Now, this city may not have the
manpower it once did...

26:20.779 --> 26:23.646
but it has the firepower.

26:24.349 --> 26:26.283
Those stockpiles left behind...

26:26.451 --> 26:31.047
by FEMA, the National Guard,
we have it all.

26:31.222 --> 26:32.985
Look...

26:34.626 --> 26:36.992
I know why you're scared.

26:37.829 --> 26:41.481
I'm scared, too, believe me.

26:42.067 --> 26:45.389
But I recognize the trust
you've all placed in me.

26:45.937 --> 26:48.838
We've been through hell together.

26:50.342 --> 26:54.335
But you all know
what we're up against.

26:57.282 --> 27:00.103
We're almost out of fuel.

27:00.919 --> 27:03.376
Which means no more power...

27:03.555 --> 27:07.036
which means we could slip back
to the way things were.

27:07.225 --> 27:11.218
That dam up there was the answer.

27:12.530 --> 27:15.283
We just had no idea
they were up there, too.

27:15.467 --> 27:16.445
So, what do we do now?

27:16.568 --> 27:18.684
Yeah!

27:18.870 --> 27:21.737
We find another way...

27:23.274 --> 27:25.538
because that power...

27:25.710 --> 27:27.405
is not just about keeping the lights on.

27:27.712 --> 27:30.101
It's about giving us the tools...

27:30.281 --> 27:32.613
to reconnect to the rest of the world.

27:32.784 --> 27:35.651
To find out who else is out there...

27:35.820 --> 27:40.052
so that we can start to rebuild...

27:41.660 --> 27:43.810
and reclaim...

27:46.398 --> 27:49.481
the world we lost.

27:53.271 --> 27:55.785
That was a great speech.

27:57.942 --> 28:00.843
There is no alternative power source.

28:01.946 --> 28:04.972
That dam is the only option.

28:09.688 --> 28:12.350
Well, then, we fight them.

28:16.327 --> 28:18.306
We're two weeks away
from running out of fuel.

28:18.496 --> 28:19.508
Maybe three, tops.

28:19.698 --> 28:20.790
I know.

28:20.965 --> 28:23.115
And once that happens...

28:23.301 --> 28:25.849
I won't be able to go out
there with a bullhorn...

28:26.371 --> 28:28.339
and calm everybody down.

28:28.873 --> 28:32.798
We need that power
to get the radio transmitter working.

28:32.977 --> 28:36.367
It's our only chance
of reaching the outside world.

28:36.648 --> 28:38.502
We have to find other survivors.

28:38.683 --> 28:41.675
Yeah. There's not that many of us left.

28:42.554 --> 28:44.442
We can't afford any more casualties.

28:44.622 --> 28:47.318
We founded this place...

28:47.826 --> 28:49.805
- you and I...
- I know,

28:50.195 --> 28:53.995
on the idea that power would lead us back
to the life we once had.

28:54.566 --> 28:56.716
If we can't stick together,
maybe we can't survive.

28:57.335 --> 28:59.303
I lost everything.

29:00.872 --> 29:04.797
The idea of losing what little I have is...

29:07.679 --> 29:08.964
I want to go back up there.

29:11.149 --> 29:13.868
Listen to me. Give me three days.

29:14.052 --> 29:16.031
Let me talk to him.
If it doesn't work, then we do it your way.

29:16.421 --> 29:18.514
And what if it backfires?
What if he gets violent?

29:18.690 --> 29:22.376
I mean, how do you know
that he'll even understand you?

29:26.030 --> 29:28.419
He's more than just an ape.

29:30.368 --> 29:32.848
I'm gonna take some men
up to Fort Point.

29:33.037 --> 29:34.891
I'm gonna go through the armory.

29:35.573 --> 29:37.723
I'm gonna see what's still working.

29:39.043 --> 29:40.260
Three days.

29:40.445 --> 29:41.725
You're not back in three days...

29:41.846 --> 29:45.327
we're going up there,
and we're gonna kill every last one of them.

30:01.499 --> 30:03.979
Carver is getting the trucks ready.

30:04.169 --> 30:06.888
He'll be here with Foster and Kemp
any minute.

30:07.639 --> 30:10.506
You're really taking Carver?
I mean, he shot one of them.

30:10.675 --> 30:11.926
I don't really have any choice.

30:12.110 --> 30:16.945
He used to work at the water department.
He's the only one who knows how the dam works.

30:18.583 --> 30:19.914
Malcolm...

30:20.084 --> 30:23.645
what are you gonna do up there?
What are you gonna say?

30:25.523 --> 30:27.821
I'll tell him the truth.

30:28.459 --> 30:30.825
Hope I catch him in a good mood.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.025
You think I'm crazy.

30:39.137 --> 30:40.866
I'm worried.

30:41.639 --> 30:43.789
Yeah, so am I.

30:44.809 --> 30:47.266
I've gone over it in my head...

30:48.513 --> 30:51.596
and I think if I don't at least try this...

30:52.884 --> 30:54.977
there's gonna be a war.

31:17.408 --> 31:18.329
Take me with you.

31:18.509 --> 31:20.807
What if someone gets hurt?
You'll need me there.

31:24.048 --> 31:26.312
I love you.

31:27.719 --> 31:29.573
But I need you to stay here.

31:30.655 --> 31:32.919
I don't want Alexander to be alone.

31:33.091 --> 31:35.355
I'm coming, too.

31:38.997 --> 31:40.328
Son, it's not safe.

31:41.699 --> 31:43.678
But I'm safer with you
than I am down here.

31:44.602 --> 31:46.365
I'm coming.

31:46.537 --> 31:47.822
Please.

32:15.600 --> 32:18.467
No one gets out of the trucks.

32:18.803 --> 32:20.384
No one.

32:20.872 --> 32:24.353
If I'm not back in two hours,
you get everyone back to the city.

32:25.109 --> 32:27.088
It's gonna be okay.

35:29.293 --> 35:32.285
Please. Please. Please.

35:35.600 --> 35:37.181
Please don't kill me.

35:37.802 --> 35:40.703
Just hear what I have to say.

35:41.672 --> 35:43.105
I know.

35:44.942 --> 35:48.093
"Don't come back." I know.

35:48.546 --> 35:50.309
I wouldn't be here unless it were...

35:50.481 --> 35:52.267
Okay! Okay! Okay!

35:56.020 --> 35:59.103
Okay, okay, okay.

36:00.625 --> 36:03.378
I need to show you something.

36:03.561 --> 36:04.653
It's not far.

36:04.829 --> 36:06.228
Human lies!

36:06.497 --> 36:08.715
No! No!

36:10.968 --> 36:13.027
No, no, no. I swear.

36:15.573 --> 36:18.895
If I could just show you,
then you'll understand.

36:19.076 --> 36:20.623
Please.

36:40.698 --> 36:43.565
Show me.

37:06.691 --> 37:10.377
This is what we used to call
a "small hydro."

37:10.561 --> 37:13.314
It was built to service
areas to the north of here...

37:13.497 --> 37:16.648
but we've been working to
reroute the power lines to the city...

37:16.834 --> 37:19.382
because the city used to run off nuclear power,
but that ran out years ago.

37:19.570 --> 37:21.993
So, we've been using
diesel generators and gasifiers.

37:22.173 --> 37:24.892
But if we can just
get this dam working...

37:25.076 --> 37:29.365
then we have a shot
at restoring limited power.

37:36.520 --> 37:39.421
Is any of this making any sense to you?

37:40.558 --> 37:43.425
The... lights.

37:43.594 --> 37:45.323
Yes.

37:46.430 --> 37:47.488
The lights.

37:48.866 --> 37:50.390
This is your home...

37:50.568 --> 37:53.230
and I don't want to take it away from you,
I promise.

37:53.404 --> 37:57.966
But if you can let us do our work here...

37:58.142 --> 37:59.996
You brought others?

38:04.382 --> 38:05.747
Just a few.

38:06.684 --> 38:08.538
I'm not a threat.

38:08.719 --> 38:10.152
If I am...

38:10.888 --> 38:13.584
then I guess you can kill me.

38:38.382 --> 38:40.862
Come on!

38:41.952 --> 38:45.069
- Wait, wait, wait!
- Stop, stop.

38:57.168 --> 38:58.715
We need to give them our guns.

39:00.738 --> 39:02.922
That's the one condition.

39:03.507 --> 39:04.565
What does that mean?

39:05.509 --> 39:07.363
We can stay.

39:22.226 --> 39:25.309
If they get power, they'll be more dangerous!

39:25.730 --> 39:27.311
Why help them?!

39:27.565 --> 39:29.658
They seem desperate...

39:30.434 --> 39:33.096
If we make them go, they'll attack.

39:33.471 --> 39:35.405
Let them.

39:35.573 --> 39:38.997
We'll destroy them while they're weak.

39:40.044 --> 39:43.036
And how many apes will die?

39:45.549 --> 39:48.632
We have one chance for peace...

39:49.220 --> 39:52.189
Let them do their human work. Then they'll go.

39:54.425 --> 39:56.313
Human work?

39:59.397 --> 40:01.877
Human work.

40:04.101 --> 40:07.002
Human work.

40:07.738 --> 40:09.262
Human work!

40:47.611 --> 40:49.010
Koba say...

40:49.280 --> 40:51.373
Apes should hate humans...

40:51.549 --> 40:52.379
Enough!

40:52.917 --> 40:55.033
From humans Koba learned hate...

40:55.352 --> 40:56.967
But nothing else.

41:11.001 --> 41:12.491
Hey.

41:12.837 --> 41:13.997
You need to eat.

41:14.839 --> 41:16.693
Okay.

41:16.974 --> 41:19.033
That was brave, what you did today.

41:27.318 --> 41:28.933
Malcolm.

41:29.220 --> 41:30.767
I know everyone's depending on you...

41:30.955 --> 41:34.607
I don't care about that.
I don't care about any of that.

41:35.526 --> 41:36.777
I care about him.

41:38.796 --> 41:42.960
He saw things that no kid should see,
and I'm not letting us go back to that.

41:47.705 --> 41:49.559
I know.

41:59.416 --> 42:01.964
I have been trying
to get closer to him.

42:02.586 --> 42:04.042
But...

42:04.822 --> 42:06.153
You will.

42:10.861 --> 42:13.887
You know the scary thing about them?

42:14.064 --> 42:17.329
They don't need power, lights.

42:18.269 --> 42:21.022
Heat. Nothing.

42:21.205 --> 42:21.887
Hey, pal.

42:22.072 --> 42:23.596
That's their advantage.

42:24.575 --> 42:27.055
That's what makes them stronger.

42:27.244 --> 42:29.906
Malcolm, I'm thinking one of us
should stand guard tonight.

42:30.080 --> 42:32.173
With what? They took our guns.

42:32.349 --> 42:33.714
If they wanted us dead,
we would be dead already.

42:33.884 --> 42:36.182
Maybe they're just taking their time.

42:36.353 --> 42:37.953
They killed off half the planet already.

42:38.355 --> 42:39.185
Come on.

42:39.356 --> 42:40.277
What?

42:40.457 --> 42:42.118
You can't honestly blame the apes.

42:42.293 --> 42:45.922
Who the hell else am I going to blame?
It was the Simian Flu.

42:46.096 --> 42:47.896
It was a virus created
by scientists in a lab.

42:48.032 --> 42:50.626
The chimps they were testing on
didn't have a say in the matter.

42:50.801 --> 42:52.530
Spare me the hippie-dippie bullshit.

42:52.703 --> 42:55.854
You're telling me you don't get
sick to your stomach at the sight of them?

43:00.044 --> 43:01.295
Didn't you have a little girl?

43:01.478 --> 43:02.365
Carver, that's enough.

43:02.546 --> 43:04.207
- How did she die?
- That's enough!

43:04.381 --> 43:05.234
Or your wife, for that matter.

43:05.416 --> 43:06.576
Carver, you better shut up...

43:06.650 --> 43:08.584
before I kick your ass.

43:12.056 --> 43:13.148
Okay.

43:15.960 --> 43:18.588
I'm the asshole.

43:23.300 --> 43:25.393
Are you okay?

43:43.988 --> 43:48.118
You sound sick... You ok?

43:50.527 --> 43:52.222
Just need rest.

43:59.336 --> 44:02.897
You worry about the humans...

45:03.100 --> 45:04.863
Where's Koba?

45:05.235 --> 45:08.750
Still angry.

45:10.207 --> 45:13.438
Said he was going hunting...

45:21.051 --> 45:23.110
Look, humans below!

45:36.333 --> 45:37.994
Why are we here?

45:38.535 --> 45:41.197
Caesar trusts humans...

45:41.739 --> 45:43.798
Koba does not.

45:45.375 --> 45:47.195
Most of the arsenal seems functional.

45:47.377 --> 45:48.139
Good.

45:48.312 --> 45:49.973
We're testing them out back.

46:37.261 --> 46:38.842
Hey!

46:39.930 --> 46:41.113
Don't you move!

46:41.298 --> 46:44.290
Don't move, do you understand me?

46:45.202 --> 46:46.533
Terry!

46:46.970 --> 46:49.359
Terry, get in here, quick!

46:56.013 --> 46:58.129
Holy shit.

47:00.784 --> 47:03.685
What do we do?
What do we do?

47:03.854 --> 47:05.287
Where did he come from?

47:06.023 --> 47:08.537
- Should we shoot him?
- Maybe. I don't know.

47:12.462 --> 47:15.056
You are one ugly son of a bitch,
aren't you?

47:33.917 --> 47:36.033
Whoa, man.

47:40.591 --> 47:42.115
Dude, I think he's hungry.

47:42.292 --> 47:44.590
He must have gotten separated
from the others.

47:44.761 --> 47:45.853
You lost?

47:46.597 --> 47:48.929
Trying to get home?

47:49.800 --> 47:52.462
Go on! Get out of here, stupid monkey!

47:52.636 --> 47:55.355
Go on. You heard him. Go!

48:03.280 --> 48:05.703
Enough guns here to kill every ape...

48:06.617 --> 48:08.198
Must warn Caesar.

48:08.218 --> 48:10.516
Who knows what humans
are really doing up there?

48:30.140 --> 48:32.768
We gotta clear this blockage.

48:38.048 --> 48:39.629
I didn't know you had a daughter.

48:44.821 --> 48:46.345
Yeah.

48:51.662 --> 48:53.118
What was her name?

48:58.168 --> 49:00.193
Sarah.

49:04.708 --> 49:06.528
I'm really sorry.

49:13.150 --> 49:17.473
Well, now I have you and your dad, so...

49:24.261 --> 49:26.286
Yeah.

49:26.463 --> 49:28.351
All right, you got that straight?

49:38.375 --> 49:40.036
Whoa.

49:40.210 --> 49:42.178
That's all the wire we got.

49:42.813 --> 49:44.997
Brace yourselves.

49:46.149 --> 49:50.313
Three, two, one.

49:55.993 --> 49:58.325
- Dad!
- Malcolm!

50:03.033 --> 50:05.661
Malcolm! Malcolm!

50:05.836 --> 50:06.666
Dad?

50:07.404 --> 50:08.655
I can't see Carver.

50:32.529 --> 50:33.689
Don't!

50:33.864 --> 50:35.843
- Leave it there.
- I got it.

50:38.301 --> 50:40.360
It's not broken.

50:41.471 --> 50:44.292
Let go. Good.

50:56.219 --> 50:57.766
Thank you.

50:59.289 --> 51:00.779
You saved our lives.

51:01.391 --> 51:02.722
We've got a lot of debris to clear now.

51:02.893 --> 51:04.093
We might need a bit more time.

51:04.127 --> 51:05.913
How long?

51:44.234 --> 51:45.394
Hey, buddy.

51:52.309 --> 51:53.799
Hey... hey...

51:54.311 --> 51:56.575
What are you doing? Are you finished?

51:59.416 --> 52:00.542
What are you looking at?

52:09.326 --> 52:10.725
Hey! Hey!

52:11.595 --> 52:13.563
Hey, get out of there!

52:18.835 --> 52:21.133
- Hey! I'll kill you!
- Carver, what're you doing?

52:25.876 --> 52:27.093
Don't! Don't!

52:27.277 --> 52:28.972
Caesar, no!

52:29.146 --> 52:30.363
No.

52:44.895 --> 52:49.423
Said no guns!

52:53.069 --> 52:54.593
- No, don't.
- Please.

53:26.436 --> 53:28.290
I didn't know.

53:35.312 --> 53:38.736
Human leave now!

54:23.560 --> 54:25.221
Man, we screwed now.

54:28.865 --> 54:30.230
Malcolm?

54:31.001 --> 54:32.980
Malcolm, where are you going?

54:33.169 --> 54:33.999
Malcolm.

54:40.543 --> 54:43.023
Please, please,
I just need to speak to him.

54:46.049 --> 54:49.348
I'm sorry. That was all my fault.
But I will make him leave.

54:49.753 --> 54:52.574
This my home.

54:54.257 --> 54:56.020
You should not be here.

54:56.393 --> 54:57.724
I understand.

54:57.894 --> 54:59.873
Malcolm.

55:04.601 --> 55:06.034
She's sick.

55:08.171 --> 55:10.264
How long has she been this way?

55:17.947 --> 55:20.006
I have medicine.

55:21.017 --> 55:22.951
Antibiotics.

55:25.188 --> 55:26.371
Maybe she can help.

55:28.892 --> 55:32.612
Do not trust you.

55:34.864 --> 55:36.957
I don't blame you.

55:37.467 --> 55:39.731
But believe me...

55:39.903 --> 55:41.518
we are not all like him.

55:41.705 --> 55:43.229
Please.

55:44.708 --> 55:46.858
Let us help you.

56:16.005 --> 56:17.222
One day.

56:19.476 --> 56:22.627
You stay one day.

56:23.480 --> 56:24.989
Father, no...!

56:25.014 --> 56:27.642
- We might need more time.
- One day!

56:32.055 --> 56:34.080
Ape will help.

56:37.827 --> 56:40.694
I will not help!

56:44.167 --> 56:46.007
- This is bullshit, man!
- Get him out of here.

56:46.136 --> 56:48.798
Move! That's enough.
Come on, get out of here.

56:48.972 --> 56:50.701
Come on, man.

56:56.813 --> 56:57.939
Okay?

56:59.549 --> 57:01.847
Move, come on!

57:06.489 --> 57:08.013
Get in!

57:23.006 --> 57:25.122
See you tomorrow, asshole.

57:30.146 --> 57:33.081
Just came from the city. Humans very dangerous!

57:33.616 --> 57:35.504
Where is Caesar?

57:39.322 --> 57:42.143
With the humans...

57:47.464 --> 57:48.863
Yo, Alex.

57:49.032 --> 57:52.092
This relay's busted.
See if there's another one.

57:52.268 --> 57:53.223
Yeah.

58:14.757 --> 58:16.611
Caesar.

58:22.332 --> 58:23.253
Hey!

58:26.169 --> 58:27.659
No! No, no, no, don't!

58:27.837 --> 58:29.327
No! No! No!

58:36.479 --> 58:39.960
Where Caesar? Want Caesar.

58:40.316 --> 58:42.102
Caesar!

58:58.301 --> 59:02.465
Humans attack your sons.

59:02.639 --> 59:06.541
You let them stay!

59:08.478 --> 59:11.675
Put apes in danger!

59:13.716 --> 59:17.732
Caesar love humans more...

59:17.921 --> 59:19.320
than apes!

59:20.823 --> 59:23.974
More than your...

59:24.160 --> 59:26.094
sons.

01:00:13.142 --> 01:00:14.598
Ape...

01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:17.273
not...

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:19.176
kill...

01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:20.964
ape.

01:00:49.312 --> 01:00:51.337
Forgive me.

01:01:25.448 --> 01:01:27.712
You are my son...

01:01:29.185 --> 01:01:31.642
I need you to listen...

01:01:43.566 --> 01:01:47.434
You didn't tell Caesar about the guns we found?

01:01:50.206 --> 01:01:52.720
Neither will you.

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:08.536
Your father doesn't trust me now.

01:02:09.692 --> 01:02:12.513
You need to protect him.

01:02:12.895 --> 01:02:15.614
His love for humans...

01:02:16.199 --> 01:02:18.019
Makes him blind.

01:02:18.167 --> 01:02:19.930
I know...

01:02:20.837 --> 01:02:24.830
As long as they are here...

01:02:26.776 --> 01:02:30.701
I fear for Caesar's life.

01:03:21.097 --> 01:03:22.155
For yesterday.

01:03:46.689 --> 01:03:48.953
Look. Look.

01:03:49.125 --> 01:03:50.103
Watch.

01:03:50.526 --> 01:03:52.289
Watch.

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:54.190
"It was Friday."

01:03:55.131 --> 01:03:57.315
"A real nice afternoon."

01:03:57.967 --> 01:03:59.548
"Warm."

01:04:02.905 --> 01:04:04.998
"We were hanging..."

01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:08.140
"We were hanging out..."

01:04:08.311 --> 01:04:11.064
"at this kegger down
at the swimming hole."

01:04:13.249 --> 01:04:14.978
Hanging out.

01:04:17.486 --> 01:04:19.420
Hanging.

01:04:21.023 --> 01:04:23.890
Here. You can read?

01:04:34.103 --> 01:04:36.082
Now, this is the good stuff.

01:04:38.674 --> 01:04:40.699
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:04:47.216 --> 01:04:51.209
What the hell is wrong with you?
I thought we told you to go home!

01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:53.154
No!

01:04:53.322 --> 01:04:55.836
No! Go!

01:04:59.195 --> 01:05:00.755
- He understood that, didn't he?
- Yeah.

01:05:02.031 --> 01:05:03.760
Hey, hey, hey!

01:05:03.933 --> 01:05:05.423
Hey, hey.

01:05:10.039 --> 01:05:10.687
Hey.

01:05:10.873 --> 01:05:13.865
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:05:16.579 --> 01:05:17.944
I think he likes you.

01:05:18.114 --> 01:05:19.547
Shut up.

01:05:19.715 --> 01:05:21.444
All right, all right.

01:05:22.451 --> 01:05:25.352
You want a drink, fugly?

01:05:25.521 --> 01:05:27.580
Go on, give him some.

01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:30.180
Give him some, man.
See what happens.

01:05:33.195 --> 01:05:33.923
There you go.

01:05:34.096 --> 01:05:35.859
Whoa, hey!

01:05:38.234 --> 01:05:39.758
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:05:41.103 --> 01:05:42.081
Shit!

01:05:47.076 --> 01:05:48.134
That's good, huh?

01:05:50.379 --> 01:05:51.812
Hey, hey, hey!

01:05:52.048 --> 01:05:53.709
Okay. All right.

01:05:55.117 --> 01:05:55.765
Easy.

01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:56.634
Yeah.

01:05:56.819 --> 01:05:57.945
- Easy.
- Easy.

01:05:58.120 --> 01:05:59.098
All right...

01:06:47.937 --> 01:06:49.598
Malcolm!

01:06:49.772 --> 01:06:50.932
Malcolm!

01:06:51.107 --> 01:06:53.621
What is it? What happened?

01:08:31.073 --> 01:08:32.688
It worked.

01:08:33.809 --> 01:08:35.629
At least here it did.

01:08:35.877 --> 01:08:38.631
We'll know when
we get back to the city.

01:08:45.453 --> 01:08:46.636
Trust.

01:09:12.148 --> 01:09:14.332
Son of a bitch.

01:09:14.817 --> 01:09:17.604
You son of a bitch!

01:10:03.299 --> 01:10:06.120
The... lights.

01:10:35.664 --> 01:10:37.780
Feeling better?

01:11:14.603 --> 01:11:17.686
Mother...?

01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:30.544
Human gun!

01:12:33.849 --> 01:12:35.214
Run.

01:12:49.598 --> 01:12:53.193
Humans kill Caesar!

01:12:57.906 --> 01:12:59.874
Burn ape home!

01:13:11.887 --> 01:13:13.741
Go! Get them!

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:17.875
Apes must attack human city!

01:13:18.627 --> 01:13:20.720
Fight back!

01:13:21.163 --> 01:13:24.883
Come, fight for Caesar!

01:13:28.737 --> 01:13:30.853
Females and young stay in woods...

01:13:30.873 --> 01:13:32.454
We go to the city!

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:44.276
We will avenge your father's death!

01:13:58.267 --> 01:14:00.292
Ellie! Ellie.

01:15:49.511 --> 01:15:51.934
This is San Francisco
attempting contact.

01:15:52.114 --> 01:15:53.331
If anyone is receiving this message...

01:15:53.515 --> 01:15:57.599
we ask that you identify yourself
and your location. Over.

01:16:10.032 --> 01:16:11.613
Move, move!

01:16:25.881 --> 01:16:29.840
If you are receiving this signal,
please state your location. Over.

01:16:30.018 --> 01:16:33.886
Repeat. This is San Francisco
attempting to establish contact.

01:16:34.056 --> 01:16:35.148
If you are receiving this signal...

01:16:35.324 --> 01:16:38.043
please state your identity
and your location. Over.

01:16:39.628 --> 01:16:40.458
What is it?

01:16:40.629 --> 01:16:41.989
The apes attacked the armory, sir.

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:48.715
Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm!

01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:26.762
Keep them off the walls!
Keep them off the walls!

01:17:30.445 --> 01:17:32.595
Let's go! Get into position.

01:17:36.885 --> 01:17:38.170
- You ready?
- Yes, sir.

01:17:38.353 --> 01:17:39.684
Good.

01:17:40.789 --> 01:17:42.006
Listen to me.

01:17:42.724 --> 01:17:45.784
We are survivors!

01:17:45.961 --> 01:17:48.259
Now, they may have got their hands
on some of our guns...

01:17:48.430 --> 01:17:50.694
but that does not make them men.

01:17:51.466 --> 01:17:53.195
<i>They are animals!</i>

01:17:53.368 --> 01:17:54.460
<i>We will push them back!</i>

01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:57.133
<i>Drive them down!</i>

01:17:57.305 --> 01:18:01.207
And they will not
get through these doors!

01:18:39.147 --> 01:18:40.762
There! California Street!

01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:30.405
Bring me the rocket launcher!

01:22:43.858 --> 01:22:44.870
We have a beacon marking our location.

01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:47.119
Please, we need help.
We are under attack.

01:22:47.295 --> 01:22:48.842
<i>San Francisco. Repeat.</i>

01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:49.678
Hello?

01:22:49.864 --> 01:22:51.229
<i>Do you copy?</i>

01:23:17.559 --> 01:23:20.460
Humans escaping! Capture them!

01:23:42.684 --> 01:23:44.982
We must be getting close.

01:23:51.126 --> 01:23:53.344
I think I see it. It's down here!

01:23:57.332 --> 01:23:58.617
Dad!

01:24:15.316 --> 01:24:17.204
Oh, my God. Malcolm!

01:24:17.385 --> 01:24:18.818
Ellie, help me.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.331
My...

01:24:34.202 --> 01:24:35.328
son...

01:24:38.106 --> 01:24:39.721
My...

01:24:40.408 --> 01:24:42.103
family...

01:24:46.581 --> 01:24:47.946
Where?

01:24:52.587 --> 01:24:54.566
I don't know.

01:25:03.264 --> 01:25:06.916
Try not to speak. You need to rest.

01:25:16.111 --> 01:25:17.726
Hold.

01:25:28.590 --> 01:25:29.648
He's lost a lot of blood.

01:25:29.824 --> 01:25:31.439
Is he going to make it?

01:25:32.026 --> 01:25:33.516
I don't understand.

01:25:35.096 --> 01:25:36.791
Where did Carver get the gun?

01:25:37.632 --> 01:25:39.088
Why would he do this?

01:25:39.267 --> 01:25:40.427
Ape...

01:25:42.971 --> 01:25:44.154
What?

01:25:47.208 --> 01:25:48.664
Ape...

01:25:49.210 --> 01:25:50.757
did...

01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:54.141
this.

01:26:01.456 --> 01:26:03.344
Get in the truck.

01:26:23.711 --> 01:26:26.464
Followed the humans here. Hiding everywhere!

01:26:27.048 --> 01:26:29.562
We must catch them all!

01:26:48.069 --> 01:26:49.502
Kill him.

01:26:49.671 --> 01:26:50.649
No, no, no.

01:26:56.244 --> 01:26:58.428
Go ahead Ash...

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:01.667
...make humans pay.

01:27:05.186 --> 01:27:08.485
Caesar wouldn't want this.

01:27:46.861 --> 01:27:49.944
Caesar gone...

01:27:55.203 --> 01:27:57.683
Apes follow...

01:27:58.439 --> 01:28:00.862
Koba now.

01:28:22.096 --> 01:28:24.280
Oh, my God.
Look, the colony's on fire.

01:28:24.465 --> 01:28:26.399
Where are we going to go?

01:28:26.567 --> 01:28:28.421
Caesar, what?

01:28:36.944 --> 01:28:38.923
Is this it?
Are we close?

01:28:39.247 --> 01:28:40.578
Where is he taking us?

01:28:43.584 --> 01:28:44.437
Malcolm, stop!

01:28:52.894 --> 01:28:56.159
I don't understand.
What are we doing here?

01:28:56.331 --> 01:28:57.252
It doesn't matter.

01:28:57.432 --> 01:29:00.392
We just need a place to hide him
until we find out what's going on at home.

01:29:04.939 --> 01:29:06.486
Go move the table.

01:29:10.244 --> 01:29:12.633
Okay. Right here.

01:29:13.781 --> 01:29:14.736
Okay.

01:29:19.587 --> 01:29:20.417
Dad, look.

01:29:22.490 --> 01:29:23.650
Look.

01:29:29.364 --> 01:29:31.696
We need to operate.
I don't have anything.

01:29:32.834 --> 01:29:34.449
There's a surgical kit
back at the place, but that's...

01:29:34.635 --> 01:29:35.647
I'll go.

01:29:38.005 --> 01:29:38.892
It's not safe.

01:29:39.073 --> 01:29:42.008
He's the only one that can stop this.

01:29:44.479 --> 01:29:46.174
Humans!

01:29:46.514 --> 01:29:50.075
You ape prisoner now!

01:29:50.251 --> 01:29:54.085
You will know life in cage.

01:29:55.289 --> 01:29:57.769
More humans out there.

01:29:58.526 --> 01:30:01.074
Go! Find them!

01:30:20.448 --> 01:30:22.416
Maurice...?

01:30:23.151 --> 01:30:25.085
Koba said...

01:30:25.787 --> 01:30:28.688
...we're too loyal to your father.

01:30:31.225 --> 01:30:34.820
Protect yourself.

01:31:54.575 --> 01:31:55.667
Shit!

01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:07.404
Hey, wait.

01:33:08.816 --> 01:33:10.272
Your father.

01:33:13.087 --> 01:33:15.066
He's alive.

01:33:27.401 --> 01:33:28.322
I got it.

01:33:28.836 --> 01:33:30.053
How is he?

01:33:54.962 --> 01:33:57.749
Your... mother.

01:34:00.267 --> 01:34:01.632
Brother.

01:34:02.803 --> 01:34:04.134
Safe?

01:34:05.473 --> 01:34:07.566
For now.

01:34:16.117 --> 01:34:17.129
No.

01:34:17.551 --> 01:34:18.677
No.

01:34:21.889 --> 01:34:24.346
Not human.

01:34:28.629 --> 01:34:30.176
Koba.

01:34:34.068 --> 01:34:35.023
Malcolm.

01:34:35.803 --> 01:34:37.236
Yeah.

01:34:38.906 --> 01:34:40.237
Caesar.

01:34:41.909 --> 01:34:44.025
We need to do this now.

01:34:48.049 --> 01:34:49.539
Son.

01:35:24.351 --> 01:35:26.012
How is he?

01:35:28.289 --> 01:35:29.836
We'll see.

01:35:31.358 --> 01:35:33.337
He's very strong.

01:35:42.770 --> 01:35:44.749
It's gonna be okay.

01:36:18.005 --> 01:36:20.064
I'm so sorry...

01:36:20.975 --> 01:36:22.556
For everything.

01:36:24.145 --> 01:36:25.635
No.

01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:31.145
I...

01:36:31.485 --> 01:36:32.850
am to blame.

01:36:35.322 --> 01:36:37.506
But Koba betrayed you.

01:36:37.892 --> 01:36:39.143
I...

01:36:39.326 --> 01:36:42.955
chose to trust him...

01:36:43.631 --> 01:36:47.681
because he is ape.

01:36:48.903 --> 01:36:51.235
I always think...

01:36:51.806 --> 01:36:55.674
ape better than human.

01:36:57.978 --> 01:37:00.071
I see now...

01:37:01.849 --> 01:37:06.206
how much like them we are.

01:37:10.758 --> 01:37:13.090
Where Koba now?

01:37:14.995 --> 01:37:17.293
On the human tower...

01:37:18.465 --> 01:37:20.581
Loyal apes around him.

01:37:20.768 --> 01:37:24.192
And those who not follow?

01:37:24.738 --> 01:37:26.626
Prisoners.

01:37:27.975 --> 01:37:29.340
Maurice.

01:37:30.010 --> 01:37:31.409
Rocket.

01:37:35.683 --> 01:37:37.981
Koba killed Ash.

01:37:44.425 --> 01:37:46.484
Fear makes others follow.

01:37:49.029 --> 01:37:50.792
But when they see you alive...

01:37:52.366 --> 01:37:55.335
They will turn from Koba.

01:37:55.469 --> 01:37:57.232
Not if I am weak.

01:38:00.107 --> 01:38:04.396
Ape always seek strongest branch.

01:38:07.548 --> 01:38:11.473
I must do something to stop him.

01:38:21.595 --> 01:38:23.324
Father.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:29.925
Let me help you.

01:39:21.155 --> 01:39:23.180
Please, let us out of here!

01:41:42.896 --> 01:41:43.874
<i>Okay.</i>

01:41:44.064 --> 01:41:45.918
<i>Caesar, look.</i>

01:41:46.867 --> 01:41:48.050
<i>Apple.</i>

01:41:48.735 --> 01:41:49.827
<i>Apple.</i>

01:41:50.270 --> 01:41:52.158
<i>Good.</i>

01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:54.166
<i>Home.</i>

01:41:54.908 --> 01:41:56.273
<i>Home.</i>

01:41:58.412 --> 01:41:59.777
<i>Home.</i>

01:42:01.515 --> 01:42:02.607
<i>Yes.</i>

01:42:04.518 --> 01:42:06.406
<i>This is your home.</i>

01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:08.376
<i>Your home.</i>

01:42:10.791 --> 01:42:12.611
<i>Good. Good.</i>

01:42:13.627 --> 01:42:15.174
<i>That's good.</i>

01:42:38.285 --> 01:42:39.775
Sorry.

01:42:39.953 --> 01:42:42.069
I didn't mean to intrude.

01:42:46.093 --> 01:42:48.459
It's been two days.

01:42:54.535 --> 01:42:56.685
Your son is not back yet?

01:43:01.708 --> 01:43:03.676
Who was that?

01:43:05.112 --> 01:43:06.693
On the video.

01:43:09.483 --> 01:43:12.805
A good man.

01:43:15.689 --> 01:43:18.021
Like you.

01:43:48.855 --> 01:43:50.775
They need to get to the tower
without being seen.

01:43:50.857 --> 01:43:52.791
I'm gonna take him through the subway.

01:43:53.594 --> 01:43:54.720
I love you.

01:43:55.295 --> 01:43:58.526
Koba sent for the females and young.

01:43:58.732 --> 01:44:01.246
They're on their way.

01:44:01.602 --> 01:44:03.035
Mother too.

01:44:04.438 --> 01:44:06.656
Must go. Now!

01:44:17.985 --> 01:44:19.145
Are you okay?

01:44:29.963 --> 01:44:31.294
Who's there?

01:44:31.965 --> 01:44:34.229
If you're human, you better say so!

01:44:34.401 --> 01:44:36.221
It's me! It's Malcolm!

01:44:36.403 --> 01:44:37.654
Don't shoot!

01:44:39.773 --> 01:44:40.990
Take the stairs.

01:44:41.174 --> 01:44:43.334
They'll bring you around and
up under the street, okay?

01:44:43.477 --> 01:44:44.489
Go.

01:44:48.615 --> 01:44:49.570
Thank you.

01:44:50.350 --> 01:44:52.170
Trust.

01:44:59.259 --> 01:45:01.147
All right, I'm coming out!

01:45:01.328 --> 01:45:03.023
Don't shoot!

01:45:20.847 --> 01:45:22.098
Hey!

01:45:22.282 --> 01:45:23.681
Look who I found.

01:45:23.850 --> 01:45:25.943
I didn't know if you'd made it out.

01:45:26.119 --> 01:45:27.131
Good to see you.

01:45:27.321 --> 01:45:28.754
Don't worry.

01:45:28.922 --> 01:45:30.446
We're gonna turn all this around.

01:45:30.624 --> 01:45:32.410
What do you mean? What's going on?

01:45:32.592 --> 01:45:34.287
The apes. They're all over the tower.

01:45:34.461 --> 01:45:36.190
I lost the signal. It dropped out.

01:45:36.363 --> 01:45:37.318
Keep trying.

01:45:37.497 --> 01:45:38.987
Malcolm, look at this.

01:45:40.367 --> 01:45:43.632
C-4. Five-pound blocks.

01:45:44.271 --> 01:45:46.364
We just started setting them.

01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:48.997
They're gonna take down the whole tower.

01:45:51.211 --> 01:45:53.543
Blast them all at once.

01:45:54.147 --> 01:45:56.035
We could use your help.

01:46:34.588 --> 01:46:37.853
This is San Francisco attempting contact.
If anyone is receiving this...

01:46:38.024 --> 01:46:41.084

01:46:45.198 --> 01:46:46.984
Here.
Come on.

If anyone is receiving this,
we ask that you identify yourself...

01:46:49.870 --> 01:46:51.599
and your location. Over.

01:47:00.046 --> 01:47:01.206
This is San Francisco...

01:47:01.381 --> 01:47:03.599
attempting contact.
If anyone is receiving this...

01:47:03.784 --> 01:47:06.685
we ask that you identify yourself

01:47:09.222 --> 01:47:11.190
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:47:18.532 --> 01:47:21.285
If anyone is receiving this,
we ask that you identify yourself...

01:47:21.468 --> 01:47:22.753
and your location. Over.

01:47:27.474 --> 01:47:28.566
Dreyfus.

01:47:32.779 --> 01:47:34.235
- Can anybody hear me?
- Werner.

01:47:37.617 --> 01:47:40.552
I'm sorry, but I can't let you do this.

01:47:41.822 --> 01:47:43.642
We need to give him a chance.

01:47:44.658 --> 01:47:46.592
We need to give him some time.

01:47:47.294 --> 01:47:48.989
He's up there right now.

01:47:51.598 --> 01:47:53.418
Who's up there?

01:48:30.003 --> 01:48:35.794
Caesar has no place here.

01:48:37.777 --> 01:48:39.802
Apes follow...

01:48:40.914 --> 01:48:42.575
Koba now.

01:48:46.186 --> 01:48:48.643
Follow Koba...

01:48:49.623 --> 01:48:50.635
to war.

01:48:50.957 --> 01:48:53.505
Apes win war!

01:48:55.161 --> 01:48:58.460
Apes together strong!

01:49:03.637 --> 01:49:05.036
Caesar...

01:49:06.506 --> 01:49:07.837
weak.

01:49:11.645 --> 01:49:14.705
Koba weaker.

01:50:04.030 --> 01:50:06.578
Are you out of your fucking mind?

01:50:07.367 --> 01:50:10.359
No, I've seen things.
I've seen the way they are.

01:50:11.204 --> 01:50:13.058
They want what we want, to survive.

01:50:13.239 --> 01:50:14.331
They don't want a war.

01:50:14.507 --> 01:50:16.031
They're animals!

01:50:16.209 --> 01:50:17.426
They attacked us!

01:50:17.611 --> 01:50:20.273
Because they thought we attacked them.
They think that he's dead, but he's not...

01:50:20.447 --> 01:50:21.994
Sit down, Finney!

01:50:22.782 --> 01:50:24.215
Sit down!

01:50:47.574 --> 01:50:49.633
Trusted Koba like brother.

01:50:49.976 --> 01:50:53.275
Caesar brother to human!

01:50:55.749 --> 01:50:58.411
Koba fight for ape!

01:50:58.752 --> 01:51:00.481
Free ape!

01:51:03.056 --> 01:51:04.307
Kill ape.

01:51:04.491 --> 01:51:06.072
Koba fight for Koba.

01:51:14.934 --> 01:51:16.265
Koba...

01:51:16.803 --> 01:51:20.489
belong in cage.

01:52:08.621 --> 01:52:10.600
I know how this must sound.

01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:11.950
I don't think you have any...

01:52:17.530 --> 01:52:19.555
Do you think stopping me will matter?

01:52:20.166 --> 01:52:21.827
They're coming.

01:52:23.002 --> 01:52:25.391
Now, we made contact with a
military base up north.

01:52:26.372 --> 01:52:28.886
They're already on their way!

01:52:29.709 --> 01:52:30.835
It's true.

01:52:35.749 --> 01:52:36.511
Dreyfus!

01:52:36.683 --> 01:52:38.139
What are you doing, man?

01:52:48.328 --> 01:52:50.148
I'm saving the human race.

01:52:50.330 --> 01:52:51.160
No!

01:55:12.672 --> 01:55:13.855
Ape...

01:55:14.707 --> 01:55:16.675
not kill...

01:55:17.543 --> 01:55:18.828
ape.

01:55:44.370 --> 01:55:46.554
You are...

01:55:48.374 --> 01:55:50.160
not ape.

01:55:54.047 --> 01:55:55.594
No!

01:57:09.956 --> 01:57:11.412
Leave him!

01:57:29.308 --> 01:57:31.003
You're not safe here.

01:57:31.644 --> 01:57:34.340
They made contact.
Other people are coming. Soldiers.

01:57:34.914 --> 01:57:36.939
You have to leave now. Everyone.

01:57:37.950 --> 01:57:41.511
If you don't go,
it'll be all-out war.

01:57:41.687 --> 01:57:43.302
War...

01:57:43.489 --> 01:57:45.582
has already...

01:57:46.692 --> 01:57:47.818
begun.

01:57:49.796 --> 01:57:52.549
Ape started war.

01:57:55.701 --> 01:57:57.396
And human...

01:57:59.806 --> 01:58:02.866
Human will not forgive.

01:58:06.079 --> 01:58:09.833
You must go...

01:58:10.183 --> 01:58:13.869
before fighting begins.

01:58:15.721 --> 01:58:17.484
I am sorry...

01:58:19.992 --> 01:58:22.927
my friend.

01:58:27.700 --> 01:58:30.567
I thought we had a chance.

01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:36.568
I did, too.
