HE'LL GET TO IT WHEN HE CAN.

04:32.097 --> 04:33.360
GOD.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.839
HE IS OBSESSED
WITH THIS IDEA

04:34.839 --> 04:37.755

EVERYTHING HIMSELF.

04:37.755 --> 04:40.149
I JUST WANT TO...

04:40.149 --> 04:43.457
WE'VE GOT TO GET OUT

04:46.808 --> 04:48.636
WELL, IF YOU GET
THE JOB TODAY,

04:48.636 --> 04:50.377

DO A THING,

10:19.488 --> 10:20.750

A BETTER APARTMENT.

10:20.750 --> 10:21.925
LOOK, SLOW DOWN, BAILEY.

10:21.925 --> 10:24.101
WELL, THINK ABOUT IT,
ANNIE.

10:24.101 --> 10:26.756
YOU COULD BE IN
A BETTER SCHOOL DISTRICT
FOR NATALIE.

10:26.756 --> 10:28.105

10:28.105 --> 10:32.632

10:58.701 --> 11:00.703
I'VE GOT A KID

I'VE GOT A RESTAURANT

11:02.226 --> 11:03.532

11:03.532 --> 11:06.274
I KNOW, AND I'M SORRY.

11:06.274 --> 11:07.188
[SIGHS]

11:32.256 --> 11:34.432
IT'S REALLY GOOD.

11:34.432 --> 11:36.696
I USED TO LOVE
A GOOD MEAL.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.349

12:04.724 --> 12:07.465
NO, THAT'S JUST
ABOUT WHEN IT STARTS.

12:07.465 --> 12:09.903
WELL, AT LEAST IT DID
FOR ME ANYWAY.

12:09.903 --> 12:12.253
YOU KNOW,
THE NAUSEA AND THE...

12:12.253 --> 12:15.691
THE SORES IN YOUR MOUTH
AND THE EXHAUSTION.

12:15.691 --> 12:19.260

13:31.941 --> 13:33.421
OK. HOLD STILL.

13:43.344 --> 13:46.260
YOU CAN BREATHE NORMALLY,
BUT PLEASE DON'T MOVE.

13:46.260 --> 13:48.958
SO, LIKE I WAS
TELLING YOU, MS. MOTT,

13:48.958 --> 13:50.351
I'M STOPPED
AT THE RED LIGHT

13:50.351 --> 13:51.831
ON THE CORNER
OF VAN NESS AND MARKET,

13:51.831 --> 13:53.615
AND KER-SHAM, SHE JUST
PLOWS RIGHT INTO ME.

13:53.615 --> 13:55.660
HA HA. KER-SHAM?

13:55.660 --> 13:57.619
THAT'S A NEW ONE.
HOW DO YOU SPELL THAT?

13:57.619 --> 13:59.534
ANNIE, COME ON.
COOPERATE.

13:59.534 --> 14:01.318
MAKE LIKE
AN INSURANCE ADJUSTER.

14:01.318 --> 14:02.537
ADJUST.

14:02.537 --> 14:04.060
ALL RIGHT.

14:04.060 --> 14:08.456
STAND BACK. AHEM.

14:08.456 --> 14:11.589
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE
ANY DAMAGE TO THE FRAME.

14:11.589 --> 14:13.983
STILL, YOU'RE GONNA
NEED A NEW FENDER,

14:13.983 --> 14:16.377
LITTLE PATCH AND
PAINT ON THE HOOD.

14:16.377 --> 14:18.770
WE'LL PAY UP TO 350.

14:18.770 --> 14:22.905
GREAT. THANK YOU
VERY MUCH, MS. MOTT.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.646
BY ANY CHANCE,
ARE YOU SEEING ANYONE?

14:24.646 --> 14:26.169
BECAUSE YOU REALLY
DO HAVE--

14:26.169 --> 14:28.955
CAN IT, BUDDY.
YOU GOT YOUR ESTIMATE.

14:28.955 --> 14:31.348
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

14:31.348 --> 14:32.349
WHAT ABOUT THE...

14:32.349 --> 14:34.743
DOOR?YEAH.

14:34.743 --> 14:36.701
I'D FORGET ABOUT THAT
IF I WERE YOU,
MR. SALINGER.

14:36.701 --> 14:38.529
I CAN'T GO DRIVING
AROUND TOWN

14:38.529 --> 14:40.357
WITH A CRUNCHED-UP DOOR
LIKE THAT.

14:40.357 --> 14:41.793
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO GET MYSELF A DATE?

14:41.793 --> 14:44.361
THE DAMAGE TO THAT DOOR
IS NOT A RESULT

14:44.361 --> 14:47.364
OF YOUR COLLISION
WITH THE SUBCOMPACT,
MR. SALINGER.

14:47.364 --> 14:49.627
RUST INDICATES
AN EARLIER EVENT.

14:49.627 --> 14:51.499
REALLY?

14:51.499 --> 14:53.501
AND FYI...YEAH?

14:53.501 --> 14:55.546
FILING A FALSE
INSURANCE CLAIM

14:55.546 --> 14:58.767
IS A VIOLATION
OF THE CALIFORNIA
PENAL CODE 5-500A,

14:58.767 --> 15:03.467
PUNISHABLE BY 3-5 YEARS
AND/OR A $10,000 FINE.

15:03.467 --> 15:05.382
YOU WOULDN'T.

15:05.382 --> 15:08.429
OH, I WOULD.

15:08.429 --> 15:10.561
YOU SEE?

15:10.561 --> 15:12.955
YOU SEE?
YOU ARE GOOD.

15:12.955 --> 15:14.739
I WAS READY TO
CONFESS EVERYTHING.

15:14.739 --> 15:17.525
I'M SERIOUS, ANNIE.
YOU KNOW THIS STUFF.

15:17.525 --> 15:22.138
YOU SHOULD JUST...
TAKE THE TEST
RIGHT NOW.

15:22.138 --> 15:24.532
YEAH, YEAH.

15:24.532 --> 15:26.795
DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT IT, MAN.

15:26.795 --> 15:32.583
THESE INSURANCE ADJUSTERS,
THEY'RE VICIOUS.

15:32.583 --> 15:34.368
GRIFFIN, LOOK.

15:34.368 --> 15:36.109
WHAT?

15:36.109 --> 15:37.110
A SINK.

15:37.110 --> 15:38.111
THERE'S A SINK HERE.

15:38.111 --> 15:39.590
I FORGOT
ALL ABOUT IT.

15:39.590 --> 15:41.549
HEY, THAT MEANS
THERE'S WATER, RIGHT?

15:41.549 --> 15:43.290
WELL, YEAH.

15:43.290 --> 15:44.813
WELL, THEN HOW MUCH
DO YOU THINK
IT WOULD COST

15:44.813 --> 15:46.815
TO PUT A SHOWER IN?AH, I DON'T KNOW.

15:46.815 --> 15:48.730
TILE'S EXPENSIVE.

15:48.730 --> 15:51.951
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE ONE OF THOSE
MODULAR DEALS.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.040
I BET IT WOULDN'T
BE TOO BAD.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.955
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
I'M GONNA DO WITH
MY FIRST PAYCHECK.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.957
I'M GONNA GET US
A SHOWER.

15:57.957 --> 16:01.090
YOU'VE SPENT
THAT FIRST PAYCHECK
ABOUT 5 TIMES ALREADY.

16:01.090 --> 16:03.005
YOU WANT CARPETS,
CURTAINS,

16:03.005 --> 16:05.442

WORK AT THE MAGAZINE,

16:17.498 --> 16:20.544

AND COMING BACK HERE.

16:23.417 --> 16:26.594
THANK YOU.

16:26.594 --> 16:29.205
THANK YOU FOR
LETTING ME TAKE THE JOB.

16:29.205 --> 16:31.903
YEAH, WELL,
YOU'D BETTER GET GOING.

16:31.903 --> 16:37.779
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE
LATE YOUR FIRST DAY.

16:37.779 --> 16:40.608
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DID THIS.

16:40.608 --> 16:42.218
CLAUDIA,

16:42.218 --> 16:45.091

ALMOST 100 BUCKS A WEEK.

16:46.744 --> 16:49.617
OH.BUT HE NEEDED
THAT MONEY. I MEAN,

16:49.617 --> 16:51.836
HE'S GOING TO COLLEGE.
HE WAS SAVING UP,

16:51.836 --> 16:53.838
AND THOSE
COLLEGE APPLICATION
THINGS ARE EXPENSIVE,

16:53.838 --> 16:55.797
AND NOW WHAT
IS HE GONNA DO?

16:55.797 --> 16:57.581
CLAUDIA, WE'RE NOT
RUNNING A CHARITY.
IT'S A BUSINESS.

16:57.581 --> 16:59.148
I'M SORRY, CLAUD.

16:59.148 --> 17:01.846
BUT IT'S-IT--
IT'S JUST SO UNFAIR.

17:01.846 --> 17:03.718
OK, CLAUD, ENOUGH.

17:03.718 --> 17:05.676
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS OUR HOUSE NOW,

17:05.676 --> 17:10.638
SO IF YOU'LL
EXCUSE US, WE'RE
KIND OF BUSY.

17:10.638 --> 17:13.423
I LOVE HAVING A DOOR.

17:13.423 --> 17:17.253
HA HEE HEE.

17:17.253 --> 17:20.387
SO HOW WAS
YOUR THING TODAY?

17:20.387 --> 17:21.997
OK.

17:21.997 --> 17:23.390
THERE'S NOT MUCH
YOU CAN SAY
ABOUT IT.

17:23.390 --> 17:25.827
I MEAN, RADIATION,

17:25.827 --> 17:29.222
YOU CAN'T SEE IT,
YOU CAN'T SMELL IT,
YOU CAN'T FEEL IT.

17:29.222 --> 17:33.095
YOU JUST LAY THERE
AND HOPE IT'S
DOING SOMETHING.

17:33.095 --> 17:35.402
THAT NURSE SURE
HIGHTAILS IT OUT OF THERE

17:35.402 --> 17:37.099
WHEN SHE CRANKS
THAT SUCKER UP, THOUGH.

17:37.099 --> 17:38.274
REALLY?

17:38.274 --> 17:40.059
YEAH.
LIKE THE ROADRUNNER.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.886
BEEP-BEEP.
SHE'S OUT OF THERE.

17:41.886 --> 17:45.847
IT'S JUST THESE
SIDE EFFECTS THEY
TELL YOU ABOUT...

17:45.847 --> 17:47.762
'CAUSE THEY GOT
THIS WHOLE LONG
LIST THEY ASK YOU,

17:47.762 --> 17:49.807
AND...

17:49.807 --> 17:51.287
I MEAN, THIS GUY
IN THE WAITING ROOM,

17:51.287 --> 17:53.420
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE HAS,

17:53.420 --> 17:56.075
BUT HE'S NOT
DOING TOO WELL.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.728
OH.

17:57.728 --> 18:00.470
WOW.

18:00.470 --> 18:01.950
YEAH,
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S HIM, NOT ME,

18:01.950 --> 18:03.778
'CAUSE NOT EVERYBODY
GETS SICK.

18:03.778 --> 18:06.128
I MEAN, 10%
OF PEOPLE HAVE NO
REACTION WHATSOEVER.

18:06.128 --> 18:07.347
NOTHING.

18:07.347 --> 18:08.565
AND I'M GONNA BE
ONE OF THEM--

18:08.565 --> 18:11.394
I'M GONNA BE
ONE OF THE 10%.

18:11.394 --> 18:13.962
WHY NOT? SURE.

18:13.962 --> 18:16.095
'CAUSE, I MEAN,
SO FAR, HEY...

18:28.237 --> 18:30.065
HEY, HEY, YOU'RE
FINALLY HOME.

18:30.065 --> 18:31.675
HEY, LOOK AT
THIS SHOWER STALL.

18:31.675 --> 18:33.503
IT COMES WITH
A FREE CURTAIN.

18:33.503 --> 18:35.679
WE COULD GET
THE FROSTED GLASS
FOR AN EXTRA 100.

18:35.679 --> 18:38.073
WOW, WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU?

18:38.073 --> 18:39.640
I HAD TO WALK HOME...

18:39.640 --> 18:42.817
AND I BROKE MY HEEL.

18:42.817 --> 18:44.862
WELL, WAS IT THE
STARTER MOTOR AGAIN?

18:44.862 --> 18:46.473
YOU COULDN'T
GET SOMEBODY
TO HELP YOU JUMP IT?

18:46.473 --> 18:48.039
THE CAR IS FINE,
GRIFFIN.

18:48.039 --> 18:49.650
THE STUPID CAR IS FINE.

18:49.650 --> 18:51.521
AND I WENT DOWN
TO THAT METER EVERY HOUR,

18:51.521 --> 18:53.001
EVERY SINGLE HOUR
ALL DAY LONG.

18:53.001 --> 18:54.742
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY
QUARTERS THAT IS?

18:54.742 --> 18:57.875
THEN I WAS 5 MINUTES--
NO, OK, 10 MINUTES LATE.

18:57.875 --> 18:59.268
AND?

18:59.268 --> 19:00.617
THEY TOWED IT.

19:00.617 --> 19:04.099
THEY TOWED IT AWAY
AT EXACTLY 4:00.

19:04.099 --> 19:06.362
OH, MAN.

19:06.362 --> 19:08.756
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THIS IS GONNA
COST? I AM GOING TO WORK
ALL WEEK FOR NOTHING.

19:08.756 --> 19:11.193
I AM GOING TO WORK ALL
WEEK TO PAY FOR PARKING
ON THAT STUPID STREET,

19:11.193 --> 19:14.065
AND THAT--THAT MONEY
WAS MEANT TO BUY THE
SHOWER FOR THE SHED.

19:14.065 --> 19:16.067
IT DOESN'T MATTER,

19:16.067 --> 19:17.634
BECAUSE AT THIS RATE,
WE'RE NEVER GETTING
OUT OF HERE.

19:17.634 --> 19:19.114
Claudia: 2 MINUTES.

19:19.114 --> 19:20.724
CLAUDIA, HURRY UP.
I'M FILTHY DIRTY.

19:20.724 --> 19:23.510
I WANT TO TAKE
A SHOWER.

19:23.510 --> 19:25.207
OH, IT'S YOU.

19:25.207 --> 19:27.688
UH, I GOT TO FINISH
FLOSSING MY TEETH.

19:27.688 --> 19:30.647
UH, COULD BE A WHILE.

19:30.647 --> 19:37.219
AH HA HA! I LOVE
HAVING A DOOR.

19:37.219 --> 19:38.481
OH!

19:47.925 --> 19:49.971
OK. MY DAY?

19:49.971 --> 19:52.756
SOME DIMWIT'S MATTRESS
FELL OFF THE BACK
OF HIS TRUCK

19:52.756 --> 19:54.802
ON THE BRIDGE
THIS MORNING,

19:54.802 --> 19:57.631
THEY UPPED THE PRICE
OF BANANA MUFFINS
AT THE UNION 35 CENTS,

19:57.631 --> 19:59.850
AND I TOTALLY
CROSSED SIGNALS

TO GET HER LICENSE,

20:20.436 --> 20:22.656

DOWN TO THE COPIER PLACE,

YOU JUST TELL HIM

THING IS IS THAT
I GOT THROUGH IT,

I'M RELIEVED,

IT'S JUST I THOUGHT
THE WHOLE REASON

26:07.000 --> 26:08.305
FOR YOU GETTING A JOB

26:08.305 --> 26:09.785
IS BECAUSE YOU GUYS
NEEDED MONEY.

SUPPOSED TO BE FUN.

ARE YOU ASHAMED
OF ME OR SOMETHING?

29:49.352 --> 29:51.267
ASHAMED? NO.

29:51.267 --> 29:52.791
I'M JUST--
I'M TRYING TO HELP,
THAT'S ALL.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.444
I DON'T WANT
YOUR HELP.

29:54.444 --> 29:57.186
I AM GETTING BY, OK?

29:57.186 --> 29:58.187
GOD.

29:58.187 --> 30:00.799
JUST...
LEAVE IT ALONE.

30:00.799 --> 30:02.365
ANNIE--

30:02.365 --> 30:08.589
NO. WILL YOU PLEASE
JUST LEAVE IT ALONE?!

30:08.589 --> 30:10.286
FINE.

30:10.286 --> 30:12.071
FINE. YOU KNOW WHAT?
I AM SORRY.

30:12.071 --> 30:14.813
I AM SORRY
THAT I EVEN TRIED.

30:24.257 --> 30:26.912
HEY, MAN,
YOU'RE DOING THIS NOW?

30:26.912 --> 30:28.652
GOOD. GIVE ME
SOMETHING TO HAUL,
WILL YOU?

30:28.652 --> 30:29.915
SOMETHING HEAVY.

30:29.915 --> 30:31.525
THE HEAVIER
THE BETTER.

30:31.525 --> 30:33.788
I'M STILL JUST KIND OF
ORGANIZING THINGS.

30:33.788 --> 30:37.966
HOW ABOUT IF WE START
SLIDING THIS MONSTER STUFF
OVER INTO THE CORNER...

30:37.966 --> 30:39.838
HEY. HEY! WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

30:39.838 --> 30:41.970
UH, WE WERE JUST--

30:41.970 --> 30:43.798
YOU CAN'T JUST DRAG
THAT THING ACROSS THE FLOOR
LIKE THAT.

30:43.798 --> 30:45.104
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT--

30:45.104 --> 30:46.757
AND THAT'S
MY STEEL SAW, MAN!

30:46.757 --> 30:47.976
YOU'RE GOING
TO BREAK THE BLADE

30:47.976 --> 30:48.934
IF YOU KEEP DROPPING IT
LIKE THAT.

30:48.934 --> 30:50.109
I LOCKED
THE BLADE GUARD.

30:50.109 --> 30:52.198
I TOLD YOU
I WOULD DO THIS,

30:52.198 --> 30:54.461
SO I WANT YOU BOTH
TO GET OUT.
JUST GET OUT!

30:54.461 --> 30:56.376
MAN, I GIVE UP.

30:56.376 --> 30:59.422
IT'S MY FAULT.
HE WAS JUST TRYING
TO HELP ME OUT.

30:59.422 --> 31:00.902
WELL, YOU CAN'T JUST
PICK THIS STUFF UP

31:00.902 --> 31:02.686
AND THROW IT
INTO BOXES.

31:02.686 --> 31:05.037
THIS IS IMPORTANT STUFF,
AND I GOT TO GO
THROUGH IT.

31:05.037 --> 31:06.865
BUT YOU HAVEN'T, CHARLIE.
YOU HAVEN'T GONE THROUGH IT,

31:06.865 --> 31:08.649
AND YOU KEEP PUTTING IT OFF.

31:08.649 --> 31:10.694
WELL, MAYBE IT'S NOT
MY TOP PRIORITY
RIGHT NOW.

31:10.694 --> 31:12.392
WELL, THAT'S NOT FAIR.

31:12.392 --> 31:14.220
I MEAN, WE ALL KNOW
YOU'RE SICK,

31:14.220 --> 31:16.004
AND YOU'RE
NOT LETTING US HELP YOU OUT,

31:16.004 --> 31:17.527
AND WE'RE STUCK UP THERE
IN THE ATTIC.

31:17.527 --> 31:19.138
WHERE DO YOU GET OFF,
JULIA?

31:19.138 --> 31:21.053
NO, I'M SORRY.
SOMEBODY'S GOT TO SAY IT.

31:21.053 --> 31:23.359
YOU WANT TO ACT
LIKE NOTHING'S CHANGED.
BUT IT HAS, CHARLIE.

31:23.359 --> 31:26.362
EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED,
AND YOU GOT TO JUST...

31:26.362 --> 31:28.147
WE ALL NEED
TO ACCEPT THE FACT

31:28.147 --> 31:30.236
THAT THAT'S JUST
THE WAY IT IS.

31:30.236 --> 31:32.629
YOU KNOW WHAT, JULIA?
THE LAST THING I NEED
FROM YOU RIGHT NOW

31:32.629 --> 31:34.240
IS A LECTURE ON REALITY.

31:45.729 --> 31:47.035
HMM.

31:47.035 --> 31:50.038
HOLA.WHAT HAPPENED IN HERE?

31:50.038 --> 31:52.649
WELL, IF I'M LUCKY,
THIS IS GOING TO BE
A CHOCOLATE CAKE.

31:56.871 --> 31:58.220
I QUIT.

31:58.220 --> 31:59.526
I RETIRE.

31:59.526 --> 32:01.223
I SWEAR,
I'M NOT DOING

32:01.223 --> 32:03.356
ANOTHER THING
FOR ANYBODY
AS LONG AS I LIVE.

32:03.356 --> 32:05.358
WELL, CAN YOU GET ME
THE SPATULA FIRST?

32:05.358 --> 32:09.971
NO, I MEAN IT, SARAH.

32:09.971 --> 32:11.625
I MEAN,
I'M OVER THAT HOUSE

32:11.625 --> 32:13.061
PRACTICALLY
EVERY SINGLE MORNING

32:13.061 --> 32:14.889
TO MAKE SURE
THAT EVERYTHING'S OK

32:14.889 --> 32:16.673
AND SEE IF ANYBODY
NEEDS ANYTHING.

32:16.673 --> 32:18.153
AND THAT IS
2 BUS TRANSFERS,

32:18.153 --> 32:20.199
WHICH IS A HUGE PAYMENT,
BUT I DO IT ANYWAY.

32:20.199 --> 32:22.157
AND MY BROTHER,

32:22.157 --> 32:24.551
HE THINKS THAT MEANS
IT'S OPEN SEASON ON ME.

32:24.551 --> 32:27.467
TO YELL AT ME
AND SCREAM AT ME.

32:27.467 --> 32:29.556
AND THAT ONE UP THERE!

32:29.556 --> 32:31.950
I'M MAKING CALLS,
I'M QUIZZING HER,

32:31.950 --> 32:33.952
I'M BASICALLY
RUNNING MYSELF RAGGED

32:33.952 --> 32:35.779
TRYING TO HELP HER
GET A BETTER JOB,

32:35.779 --> 32:38.608
AND I HAVE TO LISTEN TO HER
BITCH AND MOAN ABOUT THAT JOB,

32:38.608 --> 32:40.697
BUT THE MINUTE I TRY
AND DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT...

32:40.697 --> 32:43.178
REALLY. THE TWO OF THEM,

32:43.178 --> 32:47.878
THEY'RE THE BIGGEST BUNCH
OF INGRATES I'VE EVER SEEN
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

32:47.878 --> 32:49.663
I DON'T WHY I EVEN BOTHER.

32:51.230 --> 32:52.840
WEIRD.

32:52.840 --> 32:55.190
YEAH. THEY ARE.

32:55.190 --> 32:56.191
NOT THEM.

32:56.191 --> 32:57.801
I MEAN,
CHARLIE'S SICK,

32:57.801 --> 32:59.107
ANNIE'S JOB SUCKS,

32:59.107 --> 33:00.326
SO YOU WANT
TO EXPLAIN TO ME

33:00.326 --> 33:01.805
HOW THAT'S
ALL ABOUT YOU?

33:24.611 --> 33:26.482
I THOUGHT YOU HAD WORK.

33:26.482 --> 33:27.831
NO. I DON'T.

33:27.831 --> 33:30.051
I QUIT.

33:30.051 --> 33:31.661
2 WHOLE DAYS, HUH?

33:34.142 --> 33:36.362
I NEED
A BETTER JOB, OK?

33:48.678 --> 33:51.029
I PROBABLY BOMBED
THAT TEST.

33:51.029 --> 33:54.206
I MEAN, "IF SUZY'S
THERMOMETER READS
25 DEGREES CELSIUS,

33:54.206 --> 33:56.904
WHAT IS
THE CORRESPONDING TEMPERATURE
ON THE FAHRENHEIT SCALE?"

33:56.904 --> 33:58.210
WHO CARES?

33:59.515 --> 34:00.951
OH, NO.

34:00.951 --> 34:03.476
DID I--
DID I FORGET
THE ICE CREAM?

34:03.476 --> 34:06.479
NO, YOU GOT 2 THINGS
OF COOKIES 'N' CREAM.

34:06.479 --> 34:07.480
FOR CHARLIE.

34:07.480 --> 34:09.090
AND LIME POPSICLES.

34:09.090 --> 34:11.179
ALSO FOR CHARLIE.

34:11.179 --> 34:12.963
OH...

34:12.963 --> 34:16.141
SO I DID.

34:16.141 --> 34:18.143
ARE YOU ANY GOOD
AT MATH? 'CAUSE...

34:18.143 --> 34:20.754
'CAUSE MAYBE YOU COULD
EXPLAIN THIS STUFF
TO ME SOMETIME,

34:20.754 --> 34:21.885
BECAUSE I TOTALLY JUST--

34:21.885 --> 34:23.931
CLAUDIA...
IT'S OK.

34:23.931 --> 34:26.760
GRIFFIN TOLD ME
ABOUT CHARLIE, SO...

34:26.760 --> 34:29.284
I KNOW.

34:29.284 --> 34:31.591
YOU DO?YEAH.

34:31.591 --> 34:33.288
AND IT'S OK
IF--IF, YOU KNOW,

34:33.288 --> 34:34.724
YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT IT.

34:34.724 --> 34:35.769
OR NOT.

34:35.769 --> 34:37.292
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

34:37.292 --> 34:39.903
HE'S...

34:39.903 --> 34:42.297
HE'S GONNA BE FINE.

34:42.297 --> 34:45.518
HE IS.YEAH.

34:45.518 --> 34:46.867
THAT'S WHAT
GRIFFIN SAID.

34:51.785 --> 34:53.439
HERE'S YOUR $20.

34:53.439 --> 34:55.180
THANKS FOR DRIVING ME.

34:55.180 --> 34:56.833
FORGET IT, SALINGER.

34:58.879 --> 35:00.620
COME ON.

35:00.620 --> 35:01.882
LET'S GET YOU HOME
BEFORE YOUR ICE CREAM MELTS.

35:04.885 --> 35:08.802
CHARLIE,
I WANTED TO FINISH
MY FINGER PAINTING.

35:08.802 --> 35:11.413
HEY, WE GOT
A BIG AFTERNOON, OWE.

35:11.413 --> 35:13.850
A LITTLE STORY HOUR
AT THE LIBRARY.

35:13.850 --> 35:16.462
AND I JUST GOT
TO MAKE A QUICK STOP
BY THE RESTAURANT.

35:16.462 --> 35:18.464
I'M TAKING A DELIVERY
ON A BUNCH OF SEAFOOD,

35:18.464 --> 35:21.989
AND I JUST WANT
TO MAKE SURE THOSE
SPINY LOBSTERS ARE...

35:23.425 --> 35:25.819
WHOA.

35:25.819 --> 35:26.950
MAN.[HORN HONKS]

35:26.950 --> 35:28.038
CHARLIE,
FINGER PAINTING.

35:28.038 --> 35:29.736
JUST...

35:29.736 --> 35:31.651
JUST GIVE ME
A MINUTE, OWEN,
ALL RIGHT? JUST...

35:36.525 --> 35:38.005
CHARLIE?

35:41.443 --> 35:44.794
I'M ALL RIGHT, OWEN.
JUST...

35:44.794 --> 35:46.840
[EXHALES]

35:46.840 --> 35:48.581
WE HAVE TO GO HOME.

35:53.194 --> 35:54.500
[RIP]

35:54.500 --> 35:57.546
OK. SO THIS WILL BE
YOUR BENCH.

35:57.546 --> 35:58.939
AND WORD TO THE WISE:
YOU GOT TO BE HERE.

35:58.939 --> 36:00.680
YOU GET 2
15-MINUTE BREAKS.

36:00.680 --> 36:02.116
IF WE DON'T TAKE THEM,

36:02.116 --> 36:03.552
DOES THAT COUNT TOWARDS
OUR TIME AND A HALF?

36:03.552 --> 36:05.206
HA HA.
DON'T I WISH.

36:05.206 --> 36:06.729
OH, YOU SEE THAT PHONE?

36:06.729 --> 36:08.949
DON'T USE THAT ONE.
IT'S NOT FOR US.

36:08.949 --> 36:11.604
THERE'S A PAY PHONE
IN THE LADIES', OK?

36:11.604 --> 36:13.171
SO, LIKE, ARE WE
GOING TO GET, UH,
A LOT OF OVERTIME?

36:13.171 --> 36:14.955
LOOK, JULIE,
DON'T WORRY.

36:14.955 --> 36:17.044
I KNOW IT'S KIND
OF DEAD NOW,

36:17.044 --> 36:20.003
BUT YOU ARE GOING
TO RACK UP SOME HOURS
SOON AS XMAS KICKS IN.

36:20.003 --> 36:21.570
AND DO WE GET
A LOT OF TIPS?

36:21.570 --> 36:22.963
YOU'RE LUCKY,
'CAUSE WE POOL 'EM HERE.

36:22.963 --> 36:24.573
DID I MENTION
THE SCISSORS?

36:24.573 --> 36:27.010
YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE
FOR YOUR OWN SCISSORS.

36:27.010 --> 36:30.362
AND HOLD ON TO THEM
OR THEY'LL DOCK YOU
FULL PRICE.

36:30.362 --> 36:34.235
NOW, OVER HERE, ARE
OUR SPECIALTY PAPERS...

36:49.207 --> 36:50.643
CHARLIE?

36:50.643 --> 36:53.820
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
IS EVERYTHING OK?

36:53.820 --> 36:56.388
YOU EVER SEEN
WOOD LIKE THIS?

36:56.388 --> 36:58.390
WHAT?

36:58.390 --> 36:59.565
THIS WOOD.

36:59.565 --> 37:01.784
YOU EVER SEEN IT?

37:01.784 --> 37:03.786
OH. UH...

37:03.786 --> 37:06.789
NO. NO.
I DON'T THINK SO.

37:06.789 --> 37:09.401
IT'S CALLED, UM,
PAO LOPE.

37:09.401 --> 37:11.446
IT'S AN EXOTIC
FROM COSTA RICA.

37:11.446 --> 37:15.189
IT'S GOT A P.S.I. RATING
OF 180,000.

37:15.189 --> 37:18.410
PER SQUARE INCH?

37:18.410 --> 37:19.802
WOW.

37:19.802 --> 37:21.413
WOW, THAT'S--

37:21.413 --> 37:22.805
THAT'S LIKE...

37:22.805 --> 37:24.242
THAT'S LIKE STEEL.

37:24.242 --> 37:26.505
HMM.YEAH.

37:26.505 --> 37:29.377
I LOVED THE IDEA
OF WOOD THAT STRONG,
BUT...

37:29.377 --> 37:31.727
IT WAS TOO DENSE
TO WORK WITH AND...

37:31.727 --> 37:34.339
WAY TOO HEAVY FOR A CHAIR.

37:34.339 --> 37:37.777
IT'S TWICE AS HEAVY
AS OAK.

37:37.777 --> 37:39.387
IT'S JUST...

37:39.387 --> 37:41.824
I COULDN'T BRING MYSELF
TO THROW IT AWAY.

37:41.824 --> 37:44.349
AH...YEAH.

37:44.349 --> 37:45.959
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

37:45.959 --> 37:48.527
I'VE GOT A BIKE LIKE THAT
AT MY SHOP.

37:53.749 --> 37:55.751
LISTEN, UM...

37:55.751 --> 37:58.363
DO YOU THINK
YOU COULD DO ME A FAVOR?

37:58.363 --> 37:59.842
SURE...

37:59.842 --> 38:02.845
UH, IF YOU WANT.

38:02.845 --> 38:06.371
GO AHEAD
AND TAKE THIS DOWN
TO THE BASEMENT.

38:06.371 --> 38:11.637
AND ALL
THE OTHER STUFF, TOO.

38:11.637 --> 38:12.638
YOU SURE?

38:12.638 --> 38:14.988
YEAH.

38:14.988 --> 38:17.033
YEAH. JUST...

38:17.033 --> 38:19.035
BE CAREFUL WITH IT, OK?

38:19.035 --> 38:23.039
UH, YEAH.
I WILL.

38:23.039 --> 38:25.781
AND DON'T STRAIN
YOUR BACK.

38:25.781 --> 38:27.566
IT'S KIND OF HEAVY.

38:58.161 --> 39:03.166
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING
FOR CHARLIE.

39:03.166 --> 39:06.126
HE'S SICK,
AND THERE'S SO MUCH
THAT I WANT TO DO,

39:06.126 --> 39:10.173
BUT...I CAN'T.

39:10.173 --> 39:16.832
I CAN'T FIX IT
OR MAKE IT GO AWAY.

39:16.832 --> 39:20.793
AND THAT'S
KIND OF COMPLICATED
FOR ME...

39:20.793 --> 39:25.188
'CAUSE
THAT'S WHAT I DO.

39:25.188 --> 39:28.801
BUT WHEN MY BROTHER
REALLY NEEDS ME...

39:28.801 --> 39:32.805
THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO TO HELP.

39:32.805 --> 39:34.633
I'M SORRY, BAILEY.

39:38.811 --> 39:39.812
[SIGHS]

39:39.812 --> 39:42.641
ANYWAY...

39:42.641 --> 39:46.601
I THINK THAT'S MAYBE
WHY I WAS PUSHING YOU
THE WAY I WAS.

39:46.601 --> 39:51.171
BECAUSE
YOUR JOB SITUATION...

39:51.171 --> 39:54.870
THAT'S EASY TO FIX.

39:54.870 --> 39:58.831
THAT'S SOMETHING
THAT I CAN DO
SOMETHING ABOUT.

39:58.831 --> 40:00.223
YOU TAKE YOUR TEST,

40:00.223 --> 40:02.400
AND YOU GET
A BETTER JOB,

40:02.400 --> 40:05.185
YOU CAN GET A NEW CAR,

40:05.185 --> 40:06.186
AND...

40:06.186 --> 40:09.407
AND THEN YOU'D BE HAPPY.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.452
AND I COULD DO THAT,

40:11.452 --> 40:13.802
AND THEN
I WOULD FEEL GREAT.

40:13.802 --> 40:16.239
THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS,

40:16.239 --> 40:19.808
IT MADE YOU FEEL
REALLY LOUSY.

40:19.808 --> 40:21.201
YEAH.

40:21.201 --> 40:24.247
WELL...

40:24.247 --> 40:27.250
I DON'T NEED
MUCH OF A PUSH THERE.

40:27.250 --> 40:29.644
YOU KNOW ME
AND MY SELF-ESTEEM.

40:29.644 --> 40:33.866
YEAH, BUT SEE, THAT'S WHERE
I DISAGREE WITH YOU, ANNIE.

40:33.866 --> 40:38.261
BECAUSE
THIS INSURANCE TEST...

40:38.261 --> 40:43.266
EVEN IF YOU DID
CRASH AND BURN,
SO WHAT?

40:43.266 --> 40:48.533
YOU PASS
A MILLION TESTS A DAY,
ANNIE.

40:48.533 --> 40:50.578
BEING A MOM,

40:50.578 --> 40:54.321
BEING SOBER,
YOUR SOBRIETY.

40:54.321 --> 40:56.845
IF THOSE
AREN'T TESTS...

41:09.684 --> 41:11.947
IF I COULD GIVE YOU
A GOLD STAR RIGHT NOW,
I WOULD.

41:16.909 --> 41:19.215
DON'T YOU DIMPLE ME.

41:19.215 --> 41:21.304
I CAN'T TAKE
THAT KIND OF PRESSURE.
