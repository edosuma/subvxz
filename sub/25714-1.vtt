02:30.966 --> 02:33.432
It wasn't until the neighbors
called in about the smell

02:33.434 --> 02:34.537
that they found the body.

02:35.069 --> 02:37.739
The torso was half chewed
up by the cats.

02:38.807 --> 02:39.976
Right.

02:41.043 --> 02:43.079
That's why it's always important
that you check in.

02:44.445 --> 02:47.447
It sounds like it's important
to have a dog and not a cat.

02:49.418 --> 02:50.751
Yes, Dad. I promise,
I will check in with you

02:50.753 --> 02:52.051
every single day.

02:52.053 --> 02:53.455
- Would that make you happy?
- Yes.

02:53.755 --> 02:54.690
Okay.

02:57.025 --> 02:58.927
- I'm very proud of you.
- Thank you.

02:59.461 --> 03:00.762
Your mom would be
proud of you too.

03:03.799 --> 03:06.336
So cute. Oh, my God.

03:06.768 --> 03:10.103
- Put the weapon down, Becks.
- Okay.

03:10.105 --> 03:11.738
You guys take care
of each other, okay?

03:11.740 --> 03:13.038
Always. You know,

03:13.040 --> 03:14.343
I got her.
Nothing's gonna happen.

03:14.610 --> 03:16.042
You realize nobody
of your generation

03:16.044 --> 03:17.543
is gonna be
able to run for office.

03:17.545 --> 03:19.145
- We don't want to.
- I might.

03:19.147 --> 03:21.847
You know, I got a great face,
loveable character...

03:21.849 --> 03:24.386
- That's not happening.
- It's such a loveable character.

03:24.853 --> 03:26.389
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

03:26.789 --> 03:27.724
Bye, Daddy.

03:32.127 --> 03:33.827
The fact that you
talk about, like,

03:33.829 --> 03:35.194
procreating with my dad is...

03:35.196 --> 03:37.030
I just want to be
in your family tree.

03:37.032 --> 03:38.164
I just want to be your stepmom.

03:38.166 --> 03:39.434
It'd be kind of sick.

03:39.934 --> 03:41.200
You'd have to be like...

03:41.202 --> 03:43.372
Why did I tell her
the cat story?

03:44.706 --> 03:46.042
What the hell?

03:48.976 --> 03:50.644
Oh, my God!

03:50.646 --> 03:52.179
Holy shit! Nina!

03:52.181 --> 03:53.449
What are you doing here?

03:53.648 --> 03:55.717
I haven't seen you in 15 years.

03:57.452 --> 03:59.154
- You look great.
- Thanks.

03:59.855 --> 04:00.787
You too.

04:02.157 --> 04:04.127
Um... you better...

04:05.493 --> 04:06.695
It was good seeing you, Cole.

04:07.563 --> 04:08.464
You too.

04:15.604 --> 04:17.039
Whoo!

04:17.238 --> 04:20.743
- Someone's got a new man.
- He kind of looks like...

04:26.582 --> 04:28.951
Here's my badge.
You want to see the gun too?

04:29.750 --> 04:31.453
Sorry, Officer. My bad.

04:35.823 --> 04:37.023
- Yeah?
- <i>We found the lab.</i>

04:37.025 --> 04:38.491
<i>Do we wait?</i>

04:38.493 --> 04:40.092
No, we don't wait.
We go tonight.

04:40.094 --> 04:41.794
<i>All right.
Meet us at the warehouse.</i>

05:14.029 --> 05:14.964
Backup is on the way.

05:15.563 --> 05:16.799
If we wait, he's gone.

05:19.066 --> 05:20.502
Let's go get this guy.

06:38.914 --> 06:40.647
- Oh, shit. Don't shoot.
- Freeze.

06:40.649 --> 06:42.851
Please, I've got kids.
Please, please.

06:43.851 --> 06:44.953
Where's Hernandez?

06:45.186 --> 06:46.953
In the other room.
Please let me go.

06:46.955 --> 06:48.324
I got nothing
to do with this shit.

06:48.924 --> 06:50.159
- Get the fuck out here.
- Please.

07:13.782 --> 07:14.950
Vincent Hernandez,
you're under arrest!

07:15.316 --> 07:16.950
Freeze, do not move!

07:16.952 --> 07:18.885
- Put that thing down!
- Freeze, goddamn it!

07:18.887 --> 07:19.986
They're running!

07:19.988 --> 07:21.023
Fuck you, pigs!

07:21.890 --> 07:23.325
Put the fucking knife...

07:23.959 --> 07:25.728
Put it down! I said, stop!

07:26.027 --> 07:27.160
You're gonna shoot me?

07:27.162 --> 07:28.330
Get against the fucking pole!

07:28.729 --> 07:29.862
Get against the fucking pole.

07:34.368 --> 07:36.005
Stay right against
this fucking pole.

07:36.438 --> 07:37.804
I ain't telling you shit!

07:43.878 --> 07:45.080
A little bad cop.

07:46.714 --> 07:48.984
Hey, hey, hey, stop!

07:49.250 --> 07:50.852
Against the table.
You're under arrest.

07:52.087 --> 07:53.923
- Hands behind your back.
- Babe!

07:54.722 --> 07:56.025
- Babe!
- Stop it right now.

07:56.258 --> 07:57.159
Shut the fuck up!

08:00.361 --> 08:02.164
Shut the fuck up. You got him?

08:02.731 --> 08:05.198
Let me go or I slit
this fucker's throat!

08:05.200 --> 08:06.836
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no, no!

08:07.736 --> 08:08.671
Let me go!

08:10.905 --> 08:12.438
I'm gonna fucking kill him!

08:12.440 --> 08:14.010
- Drop the knife and let him go!
- Let me go now!

08:14.275 --> 08:15.941
- Drop the knife!
- Let me go!

08:15.943 --> 08:17.910
- That's not happening.
- Let me go! Let me go!

08:17.912 --> 08:20.749
Put the knife down!
Drop that knife and let him go!

08:20.948 --> 08:22.318
I'm gonna slit his throat!

08:23.051 --> 08:24.184
No!

08:24.186 --> 08:25.087
Fuck!

08:25.486 --> 08:26.421
Oh, shit!

08:29.890 --> 08:30.792
Fuck!

08:31.792 --> 08:32.727
Holy shit!

08:42.471 --> 08:44.140
You reap what you sow, boy.

08:45.874 --> 08:47.043
Shut the fuck up!

08:47.241 --> 08:48.443
You reap what you sow!

08:48.909 --> 08:50.777
Shut the fuck up!

09:25.313 --> 09:28.250
Suspension.
Pending an IA investigation.

09:30.785 --> 09:31.853
Hey, you wanna grab a drink?

09:34.255 --> 09:35.790
Yeah, alone.

09:53.875 --> 09:57.847
Are we the only ones here
who literally know no one?

09:58.413 --> 10:01.281
I'm no one. Okay, that's fine.
I see how it is.

10:01.283 --> 10:03.316
- I wasn't talking about you, B.
- Childhood best friend.

10:03.318 --> 10:05.284
I know,
and that's the beauty of it.

10:05.286 --> 10:07.489
I can let the whole
slept-with-a-teacher...

10:08.189 --> 10:09.855
couple-teachers thing go,

10:09.857 --> 10:11.825
and you can let the whole
detective's daughter,

10:11.827 --> 10:13.125
strait-laced virgin...

10:13.127 --> 10:15.363
- All right, I get it.
- Okay, okay.

10:16.398 --> 10:17.933
Hey, we should do that.

10:18.866 --> 10:20.599
Instant social life,
instant friends.

10:20.601 --> 10:22.100
Instant liver damage?

10:22.102 --> 10:23.436
Yes, but Phi Lambda
is the dream.

10:23.438 --> 10:25.171
I mean, look at them.

10:25.173 --> 10:26.909
It'd be like if Victoria's
Secret was a sorority.

10:48.096 --> 10:50.363
Aren't sororities
kind of pretentious?

10:50.365 --> 10:52.264
Fuck, yes,
you have to pay to get in.

10:52.266 --> 10:53.999
But you'll get us in,

10:54.001 --> 10:55.301
because you can be
the virgin that they sacrifice

10:55.303 --> 10:56.806
and I can be
your slutty plus-one.

10:57.505 --> 10:58.540
I think I'm good.

10:59.073 --> 11:00.008
Wait, wait.

11:00.976 --> 11:03.442
Carter West
totally just checked you out.

11:03.444 --> 11:05.043
No, see what I mean?

11:05.045 --> 11:06.512
We're so joining.

11:06.514 --> 11:07.883
I'm not taking no for an answer.
We're doing it.

11:09.049 --> 11:12.387
<i>How can humans
do horrible things?</i>

11:13.889 --> 11:17.159
Like commit genocide
or torture... one another.

11:18.159 --> 11:19.962
Does free will exist?

11:21.596 --> 11:24.600
Or are we simply driven
by our environment,

11:25.199 --> 11:26.234
our biology,

11:26.500 --> 11:28.404
our non-conscious influences?

11:29.169 --> 11:30.438
What is consciousness?

11:32.140 --> 11:33.342
Or the notion of self?

11:34.576 --> 11:37.542
Phi Lambda is having pledges
over for Rush Week on Friday.

11:37.544 --> 11:39.247
- Oh, Becks...
- No, we're going.

11:40.981 --> 11:42.415
Okay, we can just see
what it's like.

11:42.417 --> 11:43.452
Okay.

11:43.651 --> 11:45.119
Father
of psychoanalysis,

11:46.020 --> 11:46.955
Sigmund Freud.

11:47.355 --> 11:49.291
Born 1856 in Austria...

11:50.357 --> 11:52.325
and he came up with a theory...

11:52.327 --> 11:53.562
Just so you know...

11:54.496 --> 11:56.899
Carter West likes
Phi Lambda girls.

11:58.165 --> 11:59.267
Anyone know
what that is?

12:01.369 --> 12:02.338
What's your name?

12:03.672 --> 12:06.172
We all do things, also...

12:07.542 --> 12:08.944
...that we know
we shouldn't be doing.

12:09.310 --> 12:10.245
Why do we do it?

12:32.701 --> 12:33.635
That bad, huh?

12:35.470 --> 12:38.007
Ahh... It's... Yeah.

12:39.975 --> 12:41.443
Yeah. Sororities
aren't for everyone.

12:42.077 --> 12:44.279
Though some of these girls
take it way too seriously.

12:45.513 --> 12:47.013
Yeah, most of those girls

12:47.015 --> 12:48.281
need to get
their heads examined.

12:49.417 --> 12:51.186
Easy now, my sister went there.

12:51.486 --> 12:53.289
It's the only reason I got
this sweet job.

12:53.654 --> 12:55.654
Oh, your sister has
to get you jobs?

12:56.725 --> 12:58.590
No... It's not that bad, though.

12:58.592 --> 13:00.192
I mean, I'm a valet at a party

13:00.194 --> 13:01.496
that almost everybody walked to.

13:02.097 --> 13:04.299
And it beats moving kids
into the dorms, so...

13:07.568 --> 13:10.139
So, you gonna pledge?

13:11.338 --> 13:13.105
I don't know.
I like a lot of the girls,

13:13.107 --> 13:14.474
but tonight's been a lot.

13:14.476 --> 13:16.042
Oh, my God, there you are.

13:16.044 --> 13:17.313
Okay, I did it.
I'm amazing, I got us in.

13:18.178 --> 13:19.711
- To what?
- Zeta opening rush.

13:19.713 --> 13:22.281
Basically, one giant rager
along the entire Row.

13:22.283 --> 13:24.550
Best day of your life.
We're going.

13:24.552 --> 13:27.586
- I'm sorry, we got to go.
- Bye.

13:27.588 --> 13:28.723
I hooked up
with the hottest guy.

13:29.156 --> 13:30.389
It's the treasure, like it's...

13:44.338 --> 13:46.275
I'm not gonna go
to a pool party by myself.

13:49.077 --> 13:50.209
Names.

13:50.211 --> 13:53.046
Hi. Becks Power and Riley Cole.

13:53.048 --> 13:54.450
AJ put us on the list
for this...

13:56.418 --> 13:57.582
You got to be kidding me.

13:57.584 --> 13:59.152
It looked lame anyway.

13:59.154 --> 14:00.588
Yeah, that's fine.
Whatever. Let's just go.

14:01.523 --> 14:03.258
Just you two.

14:09.396 --> 14:12.100
Oh, my gosh, Becks.
This is insane.

14:15.702 --> 14:17.072
This is insane!

14:28.616 --> 14:30.486
AJ, how are you?

14:30.818 --> 14:32.788
- This is Riley.
- Hi.

14:33.288 --> 14:34.523
- Don't be shy.
- One for you.

14:34.823 --> 14:36.321
- You want a drink?
- Thank you. Yes, of course.

14:36.323 --> 14:37.556
Follow me.

14:37.558 --> 14:38.626
- How you doing?
- I'm always good.

14:45.632 --> 14:47.532
- Vodka? Tequila?
- Vodka.

14:47.534 --> 14:49.502
Vodka. Chaser? Yes, no?

14:49.504 --> 14:51.503
- Cranberry?
- Uh... pineapple.

14:51.505 --> 14:53.138
- Pineapple?
- Yes.

14:53.140 --> 14:54.242
Why pineapple?

14:54.808 --> 14:55.778
You should look it up.

14:57.377 --> 14:58.413
Let's check.

14:59.414 --> 15:00.716
- Pineapple juice?
- Yes!

15:01.616 --> 15:04.117
You are such a sick shit!

15:04.119 --> 15:05.421
I'm a sick little slut.

15:05.687 --> 15:07.586
What is up, brother man?

15:07.588 --> 15:08.756
How's it going?

15:09.457 --> 15:11.492
- You want a shot?
- Yeah, hit me up.

15:11.693 --> 15:14.860
Oh! No, no, no!
These are not gonna work.

15:14.862 --> 15:16.863
- Perfect. Thank you so much.
- There you go.

15:16.865 --> 15:18.667
And this is for you.

15:23.471 --> 15:24.903
- How's that?
- Perfect.

15:24.905 --> 15:26.340
- Good?
- Thanks, thanks.

15:28.510 --> 15:30.746
Brains and beauty
should always be rewarded.

15:31.312 --> 15:32.380
It's rare.

15:34.848 --> 15:37.450
And freshmen getting asked
to come to upper-class Psych

15:37.452 --> 15:38.587
doesn't go unnoticed.

15:40.554 --> 15:41.457
Nor does...

15:43.223 --> 15:45.193
Well, you know, how you look.

15:46.760 --> 15:49.630
- Okay, we need a stronger drink.
- Yeah, yeah.

15:51.765 --> 15:53.566
All right. To the Row.

15:53.568 --> 15:55.700
- To...
- Getting fucked up at college!

15:55.702 --> 15:57.371
Go get in the pool!

15:57.871 --> 15:59.107
Let's do this!

16:06.914 --> 16:09.717
- You got in?
- My friend Becks got us in.

16:10.418 --> 16:12.784
- You're Riley Cole, right?
- Yeah.

16:12.786 --> 16:15.389
I'm Celeste Aster,
Chapter President.

16:15.756 --> 16:17.723
This is Ana.
She's kind of my right hand.

16:17.725 --> 16:19.325
- Hi.
- What's up?

16:19.327 --> 16:20.596
This is Phi Lambda!

16:23.198 --> 16:24.596
It's kind of our job to know
that your mom

16:24.598 --> 16:25.867
was part of Phi Lambda.

16:28.269 --> 16:29.705
- She was?
- Yeah.

16:29.971 --> 16:32.174
Chapter President '89, I think.

16:32.640 --> 16:33.775
Wait, you didn't know?

16:34.608 --> 16:35.941
There's a lot
I don't know about my mom.

16:35.943 --> 16:37.777
She died when I was seven.

16:37.779 --> 16:40.546
But that seems a little intense
for a party like this.

16:40.548 --> 16:42.715
We really think you're
Phi Lambda material.

16:42.717 --> 16:44.249
Yes.

16:44.251 --> 16:46.287
- You wanna have a real drink?
- Yes.

17:18.886 --> 17:20.321
Bring it on.

17:43.811 --> 17:46.878
Hey. Can we talk about this?

17:46.880 --> 17:49.615
Carter, I saw you
with that chick.

17:49.617 --> 17:51.820
You know, I thought this time
with me, it would be different.

17:53.987 --> 17:55.623
You're supposed to know
how this works.

17:58.559 --> 17:59.561
You're right.

18:01.728 --> 18:02.764
Isabel.

18:04.532 --> 18:05.500
Wait.

19:07.495 --> 19:09.497
Leave me the fuck alone, Carter.

19:18.505 --> 19:19.841
I said, I don't want to talk!

19:27.582 --> 19:28.816
Come on, what is this?

19:32.786 --> 19:33.721
What the fuck?

19:51.406 --> 19:52.573
Please.

20:24.505 --> 20:25.873
I'm still alive, Dad.

20:28.476 --> 20:30.042
<i>Just checking in.</i>

20:30.044 --> 20:31.580
<i>How'd you spend
your first weekend on campus?</i>

20:32.179 --> 20:34.582
Mmm... just stayed in
with Becks.

20:36.050 --> 20:37.018
<i>Who?</i>

20:41.121 --> 20:42.187
How's work?

20:42.189 --> 20:44.058
It's... same as ever, busy.

20:45.592 --> 20:46.591
<i>You got a dog yet?</i>

20:47.562 --> 20:48.630
I'm thinking about it.

20:51.631 --> 20:53.131
Dad, did you know that Mom

20:53.133 --> 20:54.769
<i>was a part of a sorority
called Phi Lambda?</i>

20:57.471 --> 20:58.406
<i>Dad!</i>

20:58.605 --> 20:59.707
Yeah, I'm here.

21:00.708 --> 21:02.009
I thought you said that Mom
hated sororities.

21:03.076 --> 21:05.413
I doubt I said that, I'm...

21:06.813 --> 21:09.551
I'm on a case, Riley.
I got to go. I'm busy.

21:10.650 --> 21:11.686
Right.

21:12.986 --> 21:14.422
- I love you.
- <i>I love you, bye.</i>

22:54.889 --> 22:58.526
Ladies,
welcome to Phi Lambda.

22:59.694 --> 23:02.194
You bad bitches
are the chosen few

23:02.196 --> 23:04.228
who have been selected
to take the next step

23:04.230 --> 23:05.666
towards initiation.

23:06.233 --> 23:08.669
But now you can relax.
No hazing.

23:09.136 --> 23:11.540
Tonight is about getting
a little drunk.

23:11.772 --> 23:13.775
And most of all,
it's about having fun.

23:14.374 --> 23:16.708
So to tonight's new sisters!

23:21.716 --> 23:24.084
Or are you trying a small on?

23:31.659 --> 23:32.826
She looks just like you.

23:35.095 --> 23:36.698
I can't believe she was here.

23:38.966 --> 23:40.802
Becks, she was here,
in this house.

23:41.968 --> 23:43.671
There's a lot
I don't know about her.

23:44.639 --> 23:45.840
Maybe you're meant to be here.

23:47.041 --> 23:48.674
Maybe joining Phi Lambda

23:48.676 --> 23:51.212
is a way of reconnecting
with her or something.

23:53.948 --> 23:55.182
This way, ladies.

24:00.755 --> 24:02.221
Maybe it's body shots?

24:03.757 --> 24:04.758
This way.

24:05.793 --> 24:06.928
Keep following me.

24:07.294 --> 24:10.029
Keep it going.
Keep it moving. Let's go.

24:10.031 --> 24:11.933
Come on. Let's go.

24:31.317 --> 24:33.921
So, like,
we lied about the hazing.

24:34.921 --> 24:37.755
You dumb shits actually
believed it, didn't you?

24:37.757 --> 24:39.093
Strip, bitches!

24:39.826 --> 24:43.063
Okay, you'll have
two minutes to hide.

24:43.698 --> 24:45.330
When you're found,

24:45.332 --> 24:48.402
you'll be subjected to,
shall we say, further trials.

24:49.136 --> 24:50.705
But the last pledge to be found

24:51.005 --> 24:53.207
will be granted exemption
from these trials.

24:53.474 --> 24:56.244
So, let the games begin!

24:57.777 --> 24:58.813
Run, bitches!

25:18.399 --> 25:19.700
Sorry.

25:47.194 --> 25:48.129
Go!

25:52.999 --> 25:54.201
Fucking disgusting.

25:58.405 --> 25:59.441
Choose one.

26:02.342 --> 26:04.044
Gross! Get the fuck out!

26:05.813 --> 26:08.379
- Can I at least have my clothes?
- You can have your phone.

26:08.381 --> 26:11.149
Go take a selfie
in front of Zeta

26:10.184 --> 26:11.186
and then you can stay.

26:11.851 --> 26:12.754
Go!

26:14.889 --> 26:16.190
Come on, now. You choose one.

26:22.862 --> 26:24.466
And who are we missing?

26:41.114 --> 26:42.182
Hello?

26:44.517 --> 26:45.754
Is anybody in here?

26:49.055 --> 26:50.357
Hello?

26:52.159 --> 26:53.328
I know you're in here.

26:57.564 --> 26:58.832
Hello?

27:32.999 --> 27:34.169
Oh, thank God.

27:35.302 --> 27:36.571
Thank God you're okay.

27:39.273 --> 27:40.942
- You're okay, right?
- Yeah.

27:42.075 --> 27:44.511
Come home with me till we
figure out what's going on here?

27:45.880 --> 27:46.981
Yeah, I want to go home.

27:47.881 --> 27:48.882
Okay, good.

27:49.949 --> 27:51.282
I'm gonna go inside

27:51.284 --> 27:52.583
and see how everything's
going in there,

27:52.585 --> 27:53.554
and then we'll get you
out of here.

27:54.588 --> 27:55.954
- Okay.
- You stay with her?

27:55.956 --> 27:56.888
Yeah, of course.

27:56.890 --> 27:57.859
Okay.

28:02.563 --> 28:04.364
Give me a couple of shots
over here.

28:05.165 --> 28:06.367
Are you sure you want
to go home?

28:08.669 --> 28:10.271
You didn't see her face, Becks.

28:30.056 --> 28:31.191
She won't be the last.

28:31.958 --> 28:32.893
I agree.

28:34.027 --> 28:34.996
This took work.

28:39.132 --> 28:41.369
The sick fuck is
probably just getting started.

28:42.703 --> 28:44.939
Hey, boss,
Ellingham is on her way.

28:46.206 --> 28:48.208
I got to go anyway.
I got to get Riley home.

28:48.708 --> 28:50.143
But I want in on this,
are we clear?

28:57.650 --> 28:59.451
Goddamn it, Cole.

28:59.453 --> 29:00.385
You're suspended. What the fuck
are you doing here?

29:00.387 --> 29:02.154
Just leaving, ma'am.

29:02.156 --> 29:03.191
You have no idea
what position I'm in.

29:03.457 --> 29:04.926
I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm gone.

29:09.429 --> 29:10.430
You got suspended?

29:12.065 --> 29:14.501
- When did that happen?
- The day I dropped you off.

29:16.336 --> 29:18.338
When are you gonna start
being honest with me?

29:18.706 --> 29:19.940
I'm your kid.

29:22.176 --> 29:25.313
There are girls in there
who are complete strangers

29:25.512 --> 29:29.050
and they're telling me more
about my mom than you ever have!

29:30.050 --> 29:32.453
- Can we talk about this at home?
- I'm not going home.

29:34.254 --> 29:35.686
Ellingham wants me
to take you to your car.

29:35.688 --> 29:37.254
I'm talking to my daughter.
Give me a second.

29:37.256 --> 29:38.523
I'll be fine, Dad.
I have friends here.

29:38.525 --> 29:39.992
Now, Cole. Let's go.

29:39.994 --> 29:42.360
- Fuck.
- Come on. Keep moving.

30:19.099 --> 30:20.331
Riley.

30:20.333 --> 30:22.134
Sorry. Didn't mean
to frighten you.

30:22.136 --> 30:23.004
It's okay.

30:23.603 --> 30:24.604
Yeah, we're all on edge.

30:25.339 --> 30:28.275
- Did you happen to know Isabel?
- Yeah, sort of.

30:29.676 --> 30:31.576
I'm glad to see you're focusing
on your studies.

30:31.578 --> 30:33.381
It's good to stay busy
at a time like this.

30:35.582 --> 30:38.386
- This was decent.
- Really? Thank you.

30:39.719 --> 30:42.486
You have a surprisingly
solid grasp

30:42.488 --> 30:44.092
of psychology for a freshman.

30:44.525 --> 30:46.124
Well, my dad is a detective.

30:46.126 --> 30:47.695
So he kind of raised me
to read people.

30:48.594 --> 30:50.594
He was relentless
when I brought a boy home.

30:50.596 --> 30:52.466
Make sense.

30:53.400 --> 30:56.004
You know, I teach an advance
level Criminal Psych class.

30:56.536 --> 30:58.538
Serial killers,
criminal profiling.

30:59.672 --> 31:01.241
It's normally for seniors,
but...

31:02.208 --> 31:03.378
Think about it
for next semester.

31:03.709 --> 31:04.711
Will do.

31:05.211 --> 31:06.380
You're a capable student.

31:07.113 --> 31:08.546
I'd like to see how
far you can go.

31:08.548 --> 31:10.017
- Humph.
- Sometimes we...

31:10.817 --> 31:13.153
we get together in a group.
We order pizza.

31:13.553 --> 31:15.255
If we're feeling
really crazy, we...

31:15.721 --> 31:18.492
- crack open some root beer.
- I'll keep it in mind.

31:18.825 --> 31:20.460
- Professor Villiers?
- Petra!

31:21.227 --> 31:22.295
Let's go to my office.

31:23.697 --> 31:25.198
- Take care, Riley.
- See you.

31:29.102 --> 31:31.072
- What did he want?
- Nothing.

31:32.605 --> 31:33.740
I brought you something.

31:34.507 --> 31:36.340
- What?
- Something...

31:36.342 --> 31:38.111
Class of '89. Is my mom in here?

31:38.312 --> 31:39.380
Check it out.

31:42.615 --> 31:43.784
Tonight we're honoring Isabel.

31:44.217 --> 31:45.716
We're all gonna just meet up
at Randy's,

31:45.718 --> 31:47.388
this main bar
we all hang out at.

31:48.155 --> 31:49.090
Will you come?

31:49.689 --> 31:51.122
Yes.

31:56.863 --> 31:59.630
Her computer looks like she's on
all the usual social media.

31:59.632 --> 32:01.299
<i>We're going through
it all but there's</i>

32:01.301 --> 32:02.434
<i>one thing I found interesting.</i>

32:02.436 --> 32:03.834
Tell me.

32:03.836 --> 32:05.338
<i>There's one app
she constantly used.</i>

32:05.538 --> 32:08.175
It doesn't have a name,
just a Greek symbol. Row.

32:08.475 --> 32:10.341
And none of our guys here
have ever heard of it.

32:10.343 --> 32:11.709
Not even the techs.

32:11.711 --> 32:13.244
<i>They can't even
recover the data.</i>

32:13.246 --> 32:14.913
Can't you just download
it yourself?

32:14.915 --> 32:17.715
<i>Well, I tried. It's not
on the App Store or Android.</i>

32:17.717 --> 32:19.419
The only thing I found on it

32:19.719 --> 32:22.320
<i>was some dark-web rumor blog.</i>

32:22.322 --> 32:24.659
<i>Apparently, you need to be
invited with some access code.</i>

32:25.324 --> 32:26.494
<i>Some Illuminati type shit.</i>

32:26.793 --> 32:28.129
<i>Run it down.</i>

32:32.565 --> 32:33.898
What?

32:33.900 --> 32:35.570
- Kind of fun.
- You've been here before?

32:36.503 --> 32:38.669
I've heard about things.

32:38.671 --> 32:39.838
You've heard about Randy's?

32:39.840 --> 32:41.509
Yeah, I've heard about Randy's.

33:04.598 --> 33:05.533
Hi.

33:05.798 --> 33:07.400
- How are you?
- I'm good.

33:08.534 --> 33:10.505
- Hey, girls.
- Hi, Riley.

33:12.738 --> 33:15.208
I got ditched
for a boy, quickly.

33:19.947 --> 33:21.349
What game are you playing?

33:23.417 --> 33:26.454
Row. It's like Greek Tinder.

33:26.820 --> 33:29.756
You have to be in a sorority
or a frat and be invited.

33:29.957 --> 33:31.525
You won't find that anywhere.

33:31.858 --> 33:33.457
Not for pledges.

33:33.459 --> 33:36.596
Right here.
And I have party favors.

33:38.832 --> 33:39.863
I love you!

33:39.865 --> 33:43.435
Just one. I got you, here.

33:43.437 --> 33:44.705
Thank you very much.

33:46.305 --> 33:47.606
Here we go. Okay.

33:47.608 --> 33:49.907
- One for you.
- Okay. Ready?

33:49.909 --> 33:51.810
To Isabel.

33:51.812 --> 33:53.410
- To Isabel!
- Isabel!

33:53.412 --> 33:55.348
- Wait, what is this?
- What?

33:55.681 --> 33:58.285
- It's Molly.
- Molly. Magic Molly.

33:59.785 --> 34:01.418
I think I'm just gonna drink.

34:01.420 --> 34:02.856
- No!
- What?

34:03.390 --> 34:05.659
Listen, you only live once.

34:05.958 --> 34:08.726
This is college.
Have a little fucking fun!

34:08.728 --> 34:10.293
Have a little
fucking fun!

34:10.295 --> 34:11.762
We treat you so nice.

34:12.831 --> 34:14.364
I'm telling you.

36:36.642 --> 36:38.079
You okay?

36:42.182 --> 36:43.584
We really have to stop
meeting like this.

36:46.852 --> 36:47.887
This is not my scene.

37:06.472 --> 37:07.741
- Okay.
- You good?

37:10.876 --> 37:13.079
- I'm Miller, by the way.
- Riley.

37:14.814 --> 37:16.583
Nice to meet you, Riley.

37:21.121 --> 37:23.557
Hey. Excuse me.

37:24.691 --> 37:25.893
Excuse me,
you can't go in there.

37:26.892 --> 37:29.764
Calm down, fun police.
I'm not driving.

37:30.162 --> 37:32.400
I just need these to get back
into my apartment.

37:32.865 --> 37:34.068
Is that okay with you?

37:35.901 --> 37:37.704
I'll be back
for the car tomorrow.

37:38.637 --> 37:39.405
Feel free to wax it.

37:42.476 --> 37:44.945
Fucking drunk girls.
Unbelievable.

37:46.512 --> 37:47.680
I got to go home.

37:48.548 --> 37:50.618
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy, easy, easy.

37:53.253 --> 37:54.188
Okay, all right.

38:00.160 --> 38:01.061
What are you doing?

38:02.061 --> 38:02.829
I'm going home.

38:03.762 --> 38:05.165
What, you think
you're gonna drive?

38:08.133 --> 38:10.470
Yeah. Yeah, I'll drive you.

38:17.943 --> 38:18.912
Thanks.

38:23.983 --> 38:25.218
I'll be back in, like, 15.

38:43.302 --> 38:45.135
<i>Hey, it's Riley.
Leave me a message.</i>

38:45.137 --> 38:46.236
Shit.

38:46.238 --> 38:47.972
Hey, for the record,

38:47.974 --> 38:49.543
I hardly called my parents
when I was in college.

38:50.010 --> 38:52.111
Was there a killer
loose at your college?

38:53.146 --> 38:54.615
Good point. Keep calling her.

38:56.015 --> 38:57.916
You know you're not supposed
to be working this case.

38:57.918 --> 39:00.120
Yeah, well, let them try and
stop me. It's my kid's school.

39:00.320 --> 39:02.887
I'm gonna head to the office,
see what I can dig up there.

39:02.889 --> 39:04.321
Just don't let Ellingham
catch you.

39:07.193 --> 39:08.792
Sees her as an object.

39:08.794 --> 39:11.164
A doll he can play
with anyway he wants.

39:16.970 --> 39:18.038
Wakey, wakey.

39:21.340 --> 39:23.776
- Oh!
- Oh, wait. Easy, easy, hey.

39:25.311 --> 39:27.647
Wait, Riley, hang on.
You forgot your bag.

39:33.218 --> 39:35.320
Riley, your bag, your keys.

39:35.322 --> 39:36.620
Whoa!

39:36.622 --> 39:37.622
Fuck.

39:37.624 --> 39:38.826
You okay?

39:39.858 --> 39:40.927
- You all right?
- I'm okay.

39:41.794 --> 39:43.664
- I'm okay.
- You forgot your bag.

39:45.599 --> 39:46.667
And your keys.

39:50.269 --> 39:52.105
Does that look like
an apartment key to you?

39:53.139 --> 39:54.775
Yeah, yeah, they're short.

39:55.874 --> 39:57.577
Hey, listen...

39:59.044 --> 40:00.644
What do you think about
doing something

40:00.646 --> 40:04.684
that doesn't involve puking
and frat parties

40:05.084 --> 40:06.950
with a humble valet guy like me?

40:06.952 --> 40:08.621
You don't think I look hot
when I puke?

40:11.090 --> 40:12.559
Put your number in that phone.

40:19.798 --> 40:21.267
I think you look good.

40:21.668 --> 40:22.602
Call me.

40:23.202 --> 40:25.038
Wait. No, you have my number.

40:25.972 --> 40:27.070
You got to call me.

40:30.309 --> 40:31.244
You got it?

40:55.035 --> 40:56.003
Carter?

41:00.874 --> 41:01.775
Carter!

41:06.713 --> 41:07.881
I know you're in there.

41:16.389 --> 41:17.390
Carter?

41:38.144 --> 41:39.178
Carter!

41:50.889 --> 41:51.891
Carter?

42:11.510 --> 42:13.213
Oh, my God.

42:16.782 --> 42:19.916
My head is literally pounding.

42:19.918 --> 42:21.121
Tell me about it.

42:29.061 --> 42:30.096
Oh, my God.

42:32.331 --> 42:33.132
Where were you last night?

42:33.867 --> 42:35.066
We were looking
everywhere for you.

42:35.068 --> 42:36.968
I drank way too much liquor

42:36.970 --> 42:38.836
and ended up puking
in the bushes all night.

42:39.905 --> 42:40.873
You got off easy.

42:41.340 --> 42:42.942
Ana threw up in my purse.

42:43.175 --> 42:44.878
Gross!

42:45.410 --> 42:46.510
Fucking fun, right?

42:49.782 --> 42:51.951
Do you guys care if I check out
more of your book stuff?

42:52.285 --> 42:53.187
Help yourself.

42:59.559 --> 43:02.296
Mmm... thank God the pizza
is here.

43:05.231 --> 43:06.834
Pledges, get the door!

43:07.166 --> 43:08.101
So loud!

43:09.836 --> 43:10.904
Do you want to get it?

43:13.206 --> 43:14.240
God...

44:00.986 --> 44:02.053
Hi.

44:02.055 --> 44:03.056
Oh, my God.

44:03.590 --> 44:05.189
I didn't know
anyone was in here.

44:05.191 --> 44:06.927
- I almost just wet my pants.
- Sorry.

44:07.559 --> 44:09.093
I don't think we've met.
I'm Riley.

44:09.095 --> 44:10.564
Oh. Nina. I'm the house mother.

44:11.497 --> 44:14.164
- Class of '91.
- I saw your picture in the hall.

44:14.166 --> 44:15.168
Mm-hmm.

44:16.202 --> 44:19.273
Wait, '91. Did you know my mom?
Margaux Cole?

44:22.575 --> 44:24.378
- You're Margaux's daughter.
- Yeah.

44:29.115 --> 44:31.584
Yeah, I knew your mom, somewhat.

44:33.318 --> 44:35.922
That's amazing.
Would you mind looking at this?

44:38.090 --> 44:39.490
In every other picture
I've seen of her

44:39.492 --> 44:41.091
she looks so happy,

44:41.093 --> 44:42.563
but in this one, it's just...

44:43.162 --> 44:44.497
I don't know,
she seems different.

44:45.564 --> 44:46.499
Do you know why?

44:47.233 --> 44:48.468
Mmm... I don't know.

44:51.236 --> 44:52.405
I have to get going.

44:53.006 --> 44:55.375
So... It was nice
meeting you, Riley.

44:55.642 --> 44:56.577
Please.

44:57.577 --> 44:59.376
There's so much
that I don't know about her.

44:59.378 --> 45:01.479
If you know anything,
it would mean the world to me.

45:01.481 --> 45:02.946
It would mean so much to me.

45:02.948 --> 45:04.184
It's really not my place, Riley.

45:04.450 --> 45:05.919
Maybe you should talk
to your father.

45:06.519 --> 45:09.055
My dad? You know my dad?

45:10.222 --> 45:12.358
I do. I did know him.

45:14.626 --> 45:16.028
Look, I...

45:17.363 --> 45:19.900
I probably shouldn't
even be saying this, but...

45:21.367 --> 45:23.466
let's just say Margaux
wasn't the nicest girl

45:23.468 --> 45:24.470
in the sorority.

45:26.439 --> 45:29.205
Hey, Nina. Where are all
the Psych 120 papers?

45:29.207 --> 45:30.476
Excuse me, Riley.

45:46.291 --> 45:47.293
What did my mom do?

45:49.162 --> 45:51.629
Something happened at Phi Lambda
and I want to know what it was.

45:51.631 --> 45:52.966
- Riley!
- Enough!

45:53.332 --> 45:54.568
Start being honest with me!

45:57.403 --> 46:00.207
Your mother was involved
in a hazing incident.

46:01.606 --> 46:03.209
One of the girls
couldn't handle it.

46:04.477 --> 46:05.542
She killed herself.

46:05.544 --> 46:07.378
Are you fucking kidding me?

46:07.380 --> 46:09.046
I don't know any of the details.

46:09.048 --> 46:10.984
Your mother refused to talk
to me about it.

46:12.218 --> 46:15.255
But trust me, Riley,
your mother felt horrible.

46:16.322 --> 46:18.021
Everybody makes mistakes.

46:18.023 --> 46:20.323
Who keeps something like that
from their kid?

46:20.325 --> 46:21.725
- Who does that?
- She's your mother!

46:21.727 --> 46:23.126
How am I supposed
to tell you that?

46:24.764 --> 46:26.629
Answer your phone, Dad.
It's what you fucking do best.

46:26.631 --> 46:28.302
Riley! Riley!

46:31.037 --> 46:32.072
Riley!

46:33.472 --> 46:34.440
Grey.

46:36.142 --> 46:37.177
Uh-huh.

46:39.012 --> 46:40.613
All right. I'm on my way.

46:58.463 --> 47:01.267
First the arms and now the legs.

47:01.800 --> 47:03.369
What's he doing
with the body parts?

47:04.436 --> 47:06.336
I'm sure you'll enlighten us,
Cole.

47:06.338 --> 47:08.541
- How did you get here so fast?
- I was in the neighborhood.

47:09.342 --> 47:10.577
Returning to the crime scene,
huh?

47:11.244 --> 47:12.379
Check her phone.

47:13.546 --> 47:15.745
The Row will be on there.
Call me when you're done here.

47:15.747 --> 47:18.184
- Okay.
- He's making his own doll.

47:20.452 --> 47:21.785
It's a somber night

47:21.787 --> 47:23.521
here at Vanternin State
University,

47:23.523 --> 47:25.222
where earlier today,

47:25.224 --> 47:27.323
21-year-old Laura Townsend
was found murdered.

47:27.325 --> 47:28.658
Detective Cole, do you believe

47:28.660 --> 47:29.494
this could be the work
of a cannibal?

47:30.195 --> 47:32.431
- Detective! One question.
- One question.

47:32.664 --> 47:34.034
Detective Cole!

47:41.573 --> 47:42.541
Nina.

47:48.713 --> 47:50.217
What did you say to my daughter?

47:52.251 --> 47:55.655
She told me who she was
and I panicked.

47:58.691 --> 48:01.227
Why didn't you just say
something to her yourself?

48:02.195 --> 48:04.030
It's not that simple.

48:05.597 --> 48:08.235
No. No, it isn't.

48:10.135 --> 48:11.438
Nothing's ever simple, is it?

48:12.771 --> 48:13.672
- Hi.
- Hey.

48:15.307 --> 48:16.642
- Thank you for coming.
- Of course.

48:19.278 --> 48:22.149
You... feel like
getting something to eat?

48:22.381 --> 48:23.417
Uh...

48:24.483 --> 48:25.619
Sorry.

48:26.686 --> 48:28.452
It's probably not the best time
for a first date.

48:28.454 --> 48:29.687
No. No, I just...

48:29.689 --> 48:30.754
I need to go back
to the sorority

48:30.756 --> 48:31.821
for a little bit and then...

48:31.823 --> 48:33.193
we can go.

48:34.193 --> 48:35.361
You sure that's safe?

48:36.128 --> 48:37.727
Celeste hired an armed guard.

48:37.729 --> 48:39.800
So I'm sure it's
the safest place right now.

48:40.532 --> 48:41.767
Yeah.

48:42.401 --> 48:44.137
I don't know.
Wanna grab a drink?

48:46.171 --> 48:47.340
Maybe talk about it?

48:48.240 --> 48:49.443
No. Thank you.

48:51.744 --> 48:53.611
Uh, then just text me,

48:53.613 --> 48:55.211
and I'll pick you up.

48:55.213 --> 48:56.247
All right,
I'll see you in a little bit.

48:56.249 --> 48:57.217
All right.

49:03.523 --> 49:05.124
Why are you staring
at my daughter?

49:07.660 --> 49:08.829
Uh, you're Riley's father?

49:09.829 --> 49:11.231
Nice to meet you, Mr. Cole.

49:11.564 --> 49:13.366
- I'm Miller.
- It's Detective Cole.

49:13.566 --> 49:14.668
Which means I'm armed.

49:16.202 --> 49:17.334
Glad to hear it, sir.

49:17.336 --> 49:18.769
Makes me feel better to know

49:18.771 --> 49:20.307
that somebody
is looking after Riley.

49:20.805 --> 49:22.275
Are you even a student here?

49:24.276 --> 49:25.345
School of Hard Knocks.

49:25.577 --> 49:27.646
Boo-fucking-hoo.

49:31.517 --> 49:32.686
I see where Riley
gets her sense of humor from.

49:33.586 --> 49:35.522
Easy, kid. We're not friends.

49:45.363 --> 49:47.400
Wow. Riley, I'm sorry.

49:48.467 --> 49:50.202
That's a lot to find out
about your mom.

49:51.204 --> 49:52.205
Yeah.

49:52.438 --> 49:54.370
Maybe... I don't know.

49:54.372 --> 49:55.842
Maybe we can't really
judge her, you know?

49:56.541 --> 49:59.211
We've all done mean and petty
things to other people.

50:00.213 --> 50:01.445
I guess the hope
is that we learn

50:01.447 --> 50:02.749
from our mistakes
and we move on.

50:03.983 --> 50:05.151
Thank you.

50:07.285 --> 50:08.686
Do you remember that night
at the bar

50:08.688 --> 50:10.557
that I was shit-faced?

50:11.256 --> 50:12.592
Yeah.

50:13.392 --> 50:14.261
Yeah.

50:14.927 --> 50:16.262
I know that I was hammered.

50:16.461 --> 50:18.364
But I think Laura
went home with Carter.

50:18.997 --> 50:19.900
Carter?

50:21.499 --> 50:22.668
Did you tell your dad?

50:23.802 --> 50:25.736
No, because if I tell my dad
it's Carter and it's not,

50:25.738 --> 50:26.806
I could ruin his whole life.

50:27.506 --> 50:28.775
I don't know.

50:29.275 --> 50:31.878
I-I think it's better safe
than sorry on this one.

50:35.814 --> 50:37.316
You look so good tonight.

50:38.684 --> 50:39.653
Thank you.

50:41.320 --> 50:42.722
I got it from here, kid.

50:45.590 --> 50:46.592
Dad!

50:53.698 --> 50:55.532
I had a really good time
tonight.

50:55.534 --> 50:56.702
Me too.

50:56.968 --> 50:59.305
- I'll see you later, okay?
- No, you won't.

51:00.338 --> 51:01.574
No sleepovers tonight.

51:02.874 --> 51:05.644
That's... that's not
what I meant, sir.

51:07.313 --> 51:08.778
Two girls turn up at Phi Lambda,

51:08.780 --> 51:10.481
and you're walking around
like everything's normal,

51:10.483 --> 51:12.283
going out on dates
with strangers.

51:12.285 --> 51:13.584
Miller is not a stranger

51:13.586 --> 51:14.852
and I happen
to really like him, so...

51:14.854 --> 51:16.790
Really? What do you know
about him?

51:18.057 --> 51:19.523
I know that he's a hard worker.

51:19.525 --> 51:21.557
I know that he works
a valet job.

51:21.559 --> 51:23.294
He moves students into dorms.

51:23.296 --> 51:25.296
I know that he's saving up
to get a college degree.

51:25.298 --> 51:26.800
And I know that he's nice to me.

51:27.666 --> 51:29.033
Plus, his sister
was Phi Lambda, Dad.

51:29.035 --> 51:31.001
Enough with the Phi Lambda.

51:31.003 --> 51:32.803
I'm just saying,

51:32.805 --> 51:34.437
you should be happy
that I'm finally

51:34.439 --> 51:36.008
getting some female influence
in my life.

51:43.682 --> 51:44.883
Hey.

51:45.383 --> 51:46.318
Where are you going?

51:47.086 --> 51:48.955
Don't worry. I'll be safe.

51:49.354 --> 51:50.490
Are you sure?

51:51.423 --> 51:52.425
Yeah.

52:05.938 --> 52:07.773
- Thanks for the ride.
- Riley, wait.

52:15.680 --> 52:16.650
I'm sorry.

52:17.816 --> 52:19.285
I should have told you about...

52:19.651 --> 52:20.954
well, more about your mother.

52:22.722 --> 52:23.957
I thought I was protecting you.

52:25.990 --> 52:26.925
I was wrong.

52:29.695 --> 52:30.597
There's something else.

52:31.863 --> 52:33.699
The fire that your mother
died in...

52:35.534 --> 52:36.802
I don't think
it was an accident.

52:38.871 --> 52:40.039
I think she set it herself.

52:41.139 --> 52:42.675
I didn't tell you this before...

52:44.008 --> 52:46.345
but the girl from the sorority
that died,

52:47.579 --> 52:48.914
she set herself on fire.

52:50.582 --> 52:53.019
Your mother...
...was still struggling...

52:53.985 --> 52:56.789
with the guilt and depression
all those years.

52:59.057 --> 53:00.927
I think it finally
just got the better of her.

53:04.162 --> 53:05.497
Why did you hide that from me?

53:05.965 --> 53:07.097
I... I thought...

53:07.099 --> 53:08.698
What else are you hiding
from me?

53:08.700 --> 53:09.568
Nothing.

53:09.901 --> 53:10.968
I swear.

53:15.106 --> 53:16.342
Riley.

53:21.113 --> 53:22.381
Tell me we caught him.

53:22.981 --> 53:24.617
Laura Townsend had the Row too.

53:25.050 --> 53:26.883
<i>Of course she did.</i>

53:26.885 --> 53:28.519
<i>I had a couple
of our eggheads try to hack it.</i>

53:28.521 --> 53:29.653
They said they'd never seen
anything like it.

53:29.655 --> 53:30.957
The app completely wipes itself.

53:31.456 --> 53:33.423
Well, I'm waiting
for the silver lining, Grey.

53:33.425 --> 53:35.124
<i>Well, I figured we go
straight to the source.</i>

53:35.126 --> 53:37.130
We go to the app
distribution server,

53:37.530 --> 53:38.932
we find the distributor ID.

53:39.497 --> 53:40.763
So the assholes that created it?

53:40.765 --> 53:42.432
<i>Right.</i>

53:42.434 --> 53:42.968
<i>Let's get on it.</i>

54:13.566 --> 54:15.666
Hey, Zach.
Don't you fucking move.

54:15.668 --> 54:18.135
- What the fuck is this?
- What do you know about the Row?

54:18.137 --> 54:19.139
I'll get you...

54:20.706 --> 54:22.205
Come on, man.
I'm just the developer.

54:22.207 --> 54:24.173
I'll give you whatever you want.

54:24.175 --> 54:26.979
It wasn't me. I didn't do this.
I didn't kill anyone. Come on.

54:34.887 --> 54:36.586
Can I talk to you for a sec?

54:36.588 --> 54:38.991
Oh, yeah. Actually,
I wanted to talk to you.

54:40.825 --> 54:43.563
Look, um, I want to apologize
for the other day.

54:44.497 --> 54:45.832
What I said was
really insensitive.

54:46.898 --> 54:49.067
I think I just got
caught off-guard.

54:49.668 --> 54:52.671
I'm really tired of people
not being honest with me.

54:55.807 --> 54:57.075
This page is torn out.

54:58.077 --> 54:59.178
Do you know what was on it?

55:01.146 --> 55:03.012
Nina, I am begging you.

55:03.014 --> 55:05.884
If you know something,
please just tell me.

55:07.586 --> 55:11.090
Okay. All right.
You deserve to know the truth.

55:18.264 --> 55:19.798
What I'm about to tell you...

55:21.233 --> 55:23.800
you can't say anything
to the other girls

55:23.802 --> 55:24.867
or I'll deny it.

55:24.869 --> 55:26.104
I won't say anything.

55:31.075 --> 55:32.010
After the incident...

55:33.845 --> 55:36.715
the university forced us
to whitewash history.

55:38.117 --> 55:39.785
They wanted to bury this story.

55:45.990 --> 55:47.291
The Doll House?

55:47.293 --> 55:48.894
Yeah, it's what we called
Phi Lambda.

55:49.961 --> 55:52.998
The Doll House
was way more than a nickname.

55:54.767 --> 55:58.100
Hazing back then,
it was a whole other level.

55:58.102 --> 56:01.106
Before the Internet
and cell phone cameras.

56:02.206 --> 56:06.246
It makes what you girls do today
look like kindergarten.

56:07.313 --> 56:09.715
Because in order to earn
one of those jackets...

56:10.849 --> 56:12.552
you had to do
the Doll House ritual.

56:15.119 --> 56:17.122
Pledges had to drink
until they dropped.

56:18.023 --> 56:21.628
Angie was the first to pass out,
so that made her a target.

56:22.727 --> 56:24.162
We took her over
to the Zeta house,

56:25.197 --> 56:26.798
where they took photos of her.

56:27.032 --> 56:29.001
I mean, it's not like they were
gonna do anything to her.

56:29.233 --> 56:30.666
They propped her up
like a rag doll

56:30.668 --> 56:32.137
and put her in positions.

56:32.871 --> 56:33.972
It was all innocent.

56:35.941 --> 56:37.877
Until Angie woke up midway,
terrified.

56:39.378 --> 56:43.046
She was screaming and thrashing
around, ran out of there.

56:43.048 --> 56:44.984
She thought the absolute worst
had happened to her.

56:46.918 --> 56:48.287
She thought she had been raped.

56:49.755 --> 56:52.388
The point was to scare her

56:52.390 --> 56:54.159
and have a little bit
of fun, but...

56:55.193 --> 56:57.329
her reaction was
way over the top and...

56:58.363 --> 57:00.032
this wasn't funny anymore.

57:01.066 --> 57:03.934
I mean, we didn't know
that she was on antidepressants.

57:03.936 --> 57:05.801
So she should never have had
anything to drink

57:05.803 --> 57:06.872
in the first place.

57:07.338 --> 57:08.771
And none of us could have known

57:08.773 --> 57:10.742
that she was going
to kill herself.

57:13.177 --> 57:14.246
It was pretty horrific.

57:23.655 --> 57:25.055
Becks, it's me.

57:25.057 --> 57:26.659
I really need you.
Please answer your phone.

57:28.227 --> 57:29.725
Becks!

57:29.727 --> 57:31.727
This is my 500th time
calling you.

57:31.729 --> 57:33.632
Please call me back, I need you.

57:47.345 --> 57:48.280
What are we doing?

57:48.780 --> 57:49.881
What?

57:51.349 --> 57:52.618
You want to know what I heard?

57:54.153 --> 57:55.919
I heard you're trying
to be the first guy

57:55.921 --> 57:58.191
in Zeta history to sleep
with every girl in Phi Lambda.

58:01.392 --> 58:02.394
Who told you that?

58:05.396 --> 58:06.732
I don't really care, Carter.

58:07.700 --> 58:11.004
It's just scratching
an itch, right?

01:00:39.918 --> 01:00:41.419
Oh, my God!

01:01:01.173 --> 01:01:02.175
Ana?

01:01:03.108 --> 01:01:05.577
Is he gone?
I waited as long as I could.

01:01:16.555 --> 01:01:17.890
Ana?

01:01:35.106 --> 01:01:36.041
Ana?

01:03:01.026 --> 01:03:04.497
Again, no sign of a break-in.
Not from the front door, anyway.

01:03:05.664 --> 01:03:06.698
What an artist.

01:03:10.702 --> 01:03:12.470
Must have been interrupted
by the roommate.

01:03:15.072 --> 01:03:16.506
See the girl
in the living room?

01:03:16.508 --> 01:03:17.573
What did he take
from her?

01:03:17.575 --> 01:03:19.075
Nothing.

01:03:19.077 --> 01:03:21.080
No body parts missing.
No doll routine.

01:03:22.546 --> 01:03:25.483
Ana was Phi Lambda.
The roommate, not yet.

01:03:26.785 --> 01:03:28.053
How do you know?

01:03:28.452 --> 01:03:30.153
Just check it out.
I'm sure of it.

01:03:30.155 --> 01:03:31.057
Okay.

01:03:31.756 --> 01:03:34.126
Hey. Come with me.

01:03:36.595 --> 01:03:38.331
- I need you on this, Cole.
- But...

01:03:38.662 --> 01:03:40.131
Just shut the fuck up
and listen.

01:03:40.798 --> 01:03:43.066
We're gonna set up a nice,
cozy dinner

01:03:43.068 --> 01:03:44.633
with the Commissioner,

01:03:44.635 --> 01:03:46.338
and then hopefully,
he makes this IA jazz go away.

01:03:46.570 --> 01:03:48.204
Just get rid
of this fucking serial killer

01:03:48.206 --> 01:03:49.342
before anything else happens.

01:03:49.608 --> 01:03:50.508
Yes, ma'am.

01:03:54.646 --> 01:03:56.082
Riley, thank God.

01:03:57.215 --> 01:03:58.215
<i>Dad, I cannot find
Becks anywhere.</i>

01:03:58.217 --> 01:03:59.216
<i>I've gone by her
place twice now...</i>

01:03:59.218 --> 01:04:04.153
Wait. Just relax.
We'll find Becks. Stay put.

01:04:08.392 --> 01:04:09.427
Come on.

01:04:12.229 --> 01:04:13.631
- Still no answer?
- Nothing.

01:04:14.231 --> 01:04:15.564
Okay. We're going in.

01:04:28.646 --> 01:04:30.315
Not again. How old are you?

01:04:31.182 --> 01:04:32.117
Becks.

01:04:33.184 --> 01:04:35.353
Put some clothes on
and answer your damn phone.

01:04:35.686 --> 01:04:36.753
Okay.

01:04:36.755 --> 01:04:38.124
Only if it's you calling.

01:04:38.622 --> 01:04:40.626
- Is that your dad?
- No, it's not my dad.

01:04:43.494 --> 01:04:44.596
Wait, wait, wait.

01:04:48.166 --> 01:04:49.068
Oh, my God.

01:04:51.102 --> 01:04:52.070
What, the shit dick?

01:05:02.613 --> 01:05:03.715
Don't mess up his face.

01:05:11.322 --> 01:05:13.256
<i>I mean, I know...</i>

01:05:13.258 --> 01:05:15.061
I understand you
discovered this Row connection.

01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:16.162
Good work.

01:05:16.861 --> 01:05:18.428
It's not him.

01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:19.832
...on campus
and you're the only one...

01:05:20.664 --> 01:05:21.865
He had dates
with all three victims

01:05:21.867 --> 01:05:22.832
on that fucking app.

01:05:22.834 --> 01:05:24.270
It's too easy.

01:05:24.602 --> 01:05:25.738
Doesn't make it wrong.

01:05:27.204 --> 01:05:29.607
- The app is a distraction.
- For what?

01:05:30.407 --> 01:05:33.242
From the true link, Phi Lambda.

01:05:33.244 --> 01:05:35.711
Why the fuck
are you with these girls...

01:05:35.713 --> 01:05:38.347
I'm not! I swear!

01:05:38.349 --> 01:05:39.849
<i>Why are they dying now?</i>

01:05:39.851 --> 01:05:40.852
<i>I don't know,
I don't know.</i>

01:05:41.352 --> 01:05:42.755
- Why?
- I don't fucking know!

01:05:48.226 --> 01:05:49.126
Follow your hunch...

01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:51.597
but I am not letting
that little prick out.

01:06:00.604 --> 01:06:02.707
- Riley.
- I heard about Carter West.

01:06:03.608 --> 01:06:04.610
<i>You know him?</i>

01:06:05.610 --> 01:06:06.512
A little bit.

01:06:07.912 --> 01:06:09.782
<i>He left with Laura
the night that she was killed.</i>

01:06:10.916 --> 01:06:11.883
How do you know that?

01:06:14.452 --> 01:06:15.621
Because I was there too.

01:06:17.289 --> 01:06:18.823
I'm really sorry
that I didn't tell you.

01:06:19.356 --> 01:06:21.459
<i>But, Dad, I really don't think
that Carter did this.</i>

01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:22.791
Neither do I.

01:06:22.793 --> 01:06:24.162
<i>When can I see you?</i>

01:06:24.595 --> 01:06:26.428
Name a time and place.

01:06:26.430 --> 01:06:27.800
<i>You can even bring
that valet guy if you want.</i>

01:06:28.867 --> 01:06:29.802
Really?

01:06:30.769 --> 01:06:31.834
- You know he has a name.
- <i>Sorry.</i>

01:06:31.836 --> 01:06:33.736
<i>I have trouble
taking a kid seriously</i>

01:06:33.738 --> 01:06:35.608
that uses his last name only.

01:06:35.941 --> 01:06:38.240
<i>And I understand that,
but Miller is his first name.</i>

01:06:38.242 --> 01:06:39.277
How about tonight?

01:06:39.577 --> 01:06:41.280
We could come over,
make you dinner.

01:06:41.512 --> 01:06:43.548
- Oh! Shit!
- What?

01:06:43.948 --> 01:06:46.684
I've got a dinner
with the Commissioner tonight.

01:06:47.519 --> 01:06:50.486
You know what, it's early,
and I won't eat too much.

01:06:50.488 --> 01:06:52.457
- How's 8:00 sound?
- 8:00 is perfect.

01:06:52.691 --> 01:06:53.990
Okay, then. I'll see you then.

01:07:01.832 --> 01:07:03.501
Hey, you're late.
I'll walk with you.

01:07:03.767 --> 01:07:05.468
So my first go round,

01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:07.805
I found three links
to faculties and students.

01:07:08.472 --> 01:07:09.707
One being Riley, of course,

01:07:09.941 --> 01:07:12.441
and a Nina Baker,
a Phi Lambda house mom.

01:07:12.443 --> 01:07:15.410
She was a student
from '88 to '91.

01:07:15.412 --> 01:07:17.814
- Okay, right.
- And an Alex Villiers.

01:07:17.816 --> 01:07:20.452
He's a psych professor.
He was a freshman in '91.

01:07:20.818 --> 01:07:21.786
And was a Zeta.

01:07:22.419 --> 01:07:23.820
Can we track his phone movement?

01:07:23.822 --> 01:07:25.356
- We're already all over it.
- All right.

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:37.966
- Hey, Riley.
- Hey, Professor V.

01:07:37.968 --> 01:07:39.271
Dinner with the parents?

01:07:40.305 --> 01:07:41.473
Something like that.

01:07:41.706 --> 01:07:44.242
My mother just moved out here.
New couch.

01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:46.545
That's a big couch.

01:07:47.544 --> 01:07:48.546
Kill me now.

01:07:48.813 --> 01:07:49.879
Huh.

01:07:49.881 --> 01:07:50.983
See you.

01:07:51.816 --> 01:07:52.851
See you in class.

01:08:26.483 --> 01:08:27.585
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:08:27.885 --> 01:08:29.084
- How are you?
- Good.

01:08:29.086 --> 01:08:30.522
- How are you?
- Good.

01:08:30.754 --> 01:08:32.857
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

01:08:33.892 --> 01:08:34.923
You're welcome.

01:08:37.696 --> 01:08:38.897
Something smells good.

01:08:39.630 --> 01:08:41.930
My dad and I have
this ongoing cooking war,

01:08:41.933 --> 01:08:44.536
and I'm convinced tonight
I'm gonna beat him.

01:08:45.469 --> 01:08:46.770
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes.

01:08:47.604 --> 01:08:48.741
Where is your dad?

01:08:49.974 --> 01:08:52.510
Um, he said he's running late
but he should be here soon.

01:08:55.913 --> 01:08:58.884
What's in the bag?
Did you bring me a gift?

01:08:59.116 --> 01:09:01.551
Yeah, yeah, something like that.

01:09:05.089 --> 01:09:06.823
Do you mind helping me
set the table?

01:09:19.703 --> 01:09:21.907
Villiers checks out,
GPS from his phone came back.

01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:24.410
- <i>Are you sure?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:09:24.709 --> 01:09:26.545
We're gonna bring him in anyway,
but he looks clean.

01:09:28.812 --> 01:09:30.415
Okay, let me know what he says.

01:09:41.024 --> 01:09:42.428
Someone wouldn't have
to break in...

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:45.029
just make copies of their keys.

01:09:47.098 --> 01:09:48.367
You got a nice place.

01:09:49.032 --> 01:09:50.068
Thank you.

01:09:50.602 --> 01:09:52.571
We moved here after my mom died.

01:09:53.404 --> 01:09:55.573
Oh, yeah? After the fire?

01:09:58.175 --> 01:09:59.477
I told you about the fire?

01:10:02.714 --> 01:10:04.650
Yeah. At the dinner, remember?

01:10:05.416 --> 01:10:06.352
Huh.

01:10:07.085 --> 01:10:08.520
Sir?

01:10:09.187 --> 01:10:10.356
Sorry.

01:10:10.955 --> 01:10:11.990
I'm sorry.

01:10:30.707 --> 01:10:31.744
Angie Rakowski.

01:10:32.878 --> 01:10:35.581
I think she has a brother.
Find out what his name is.

01:10:36.647 --> 01:10:37.615
What happened to your arm?

01:10:39.183 --> 01:10:40.418
Ohh...

01:10:41.719 --> 01:10:42.651
Shark attack.

01:10:43.854 --> 01:10:45.089
Shark attack, okay.

01:10:46.156 --> 01:10:48.126
Okay, I don't know
what to do with those, so...

01:10:48.759 --> 01:10:50.525
- I can handle this.
- I'm gonna grab a beer.

01:10:50.527 --> 01:10:51.696
Yeah, just in the fridge.

01:11:08.745 --> 01:11:11.983
Jesus Christ. Angie Rakowski
burned herself to death.

01:11:12.683 --> 01:11:14.516
Well, what about the brother?

01:11:14.518 --> 01:11:17.486
Parents died shortly before
she did in a car accident.

01:11:17.488 --> 01:11:19.657
And a brother, Miller Rakowski.

01:11:19.991 --> 01:11:21.160
He's the killer, Grey.

01:11:21.625 --> 01:11:23.825
Shit. I'll send units
to his house right away.

01:11:23.827 --> 01:11:25.694
<i>Track Riley's phone too.</i>

01:11:25.696 --> 01:11:27.165
- Riley's phone?
- <i>He's after Riley.</i>

01:11:27.831 --> 01:11:28.733
Just do it.

01:11:33.871 --> 01:11:36.071
Come on, Riley.
Answer the phone.

01:11:36.073 --> 01:11:37.209
Answer the phone.

01:11:47.885 --> 01:11:49.153
Miller?

01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:53.759
Miller?

01:12:05.036 --> 01:12:07.569
- Miller Rakowski!
- Police department!

01:12:07.571 --> 01:12:09.507
Miller Rakowski!

01:12:12.677 --> 01:12:13.943
Miller Rakowski!

01:12:13.945 --> 01:12:14.979
Police department,
show yourself!

01:12:19.049 --> 01:12:19.951
Miller...

01:12:21.986 --> 01:12:24.189
Miller Rakowski, show yourself!

01:12:29.861 --> 01:12:30.892
He's not here.

01:12:30.894 --> 01:12:32.497
Clear! He's gone.

01:12:33.298 --> 01:12:34.900
Damn! Ain't no signs of him.

01:12:37.201 --> 01:12:38.737
Wait. We got keys.

01:12:40.671 --> 01:12:42.174
It's the truck outside.
Let's go.

01:12:54.018 --> 01:12:55.521
Hey. Want to get that?

01:13:49.006 --> 01:13:50.041
Miller?

01:14:10.361 --> 01:14:11.630
Miller?

01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:36.388
Miller?

01:14:58.076 --> 01:14:59.374
You did this?

01:14:59.376 --> 01:15:01.342
Your fucking mother
killed my sister.

01:15:01.344 --> 01:15:03.682
No, they were young.
It was an accident.

01:15:04.014 --> 01:15:05.249
She humiliated her.

01:15:06.116 --> 01:15:08.284
In front of the entire
fucking school.

01:15:08.286 --> 01:15:09.421
She was all I had!

01:15:13.790 --> 01:15:16.191
After your mother
was done hazing her,

01:15:16.193 --> 01:15:17.763
Angie called me on the phone,

01:15:18.161 --> 01:15:21.864
and she was hysterical
and wasn't making any sense.

01:15:21.866 --> 01:15:24.369
So I rushed to campus.

01:15:25.836 --> 01:15:29.739
And there she was in the middle
of the quad, naked!

01:15:29.741 --> 01:15:31.239
She had doused herself
with gasoline

01:15:31.241 --> 01:15:32.276
and lit a match!

01:15:35.847 --> 01:15:39.117
I watched... my sister burn.

01:15:39.916 --> 01:15:42.720
For what?
For a fucking sorority?

01:15:42.987 --> 01:15:43.889
Huh?

01:15:46.523 --> 01:15:48.858
I fucking found out
what they made her do.

01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:50.161
The fucking Doll House!

01:15:50.795 --> 01:15:52.698
Oh, the Doll House?

01:15:53.397 --> 01:15:54.399
The Doll House.

01:15:57.802 --> 01:15:59.871
I'm gonna show you a real
motherfucking doll house.

01:16:03.974 --> 01:16:05.343
You think you can haze people?

01:16:06.811 --> 01:16:07.879
Oh, I can haze people.

01:16:08.812 --> 01:16:14.351
But I am gonna have
way, way, way more fucking fun.

01:16:18.455 --> 01:16:19.490
I'm sorry.

01:16:20.424 --> 01:16:22.761
No. No.

01:16:27.165 --> 01:16:29.267
I'm afraid we're way past
the point of apologies.

01:16:33.437 --> 01:16:34.339
Come here!

01:16:59.897 --> 01:17:01.533
Answer the phone, damn it!

01:17:03.067 --> 01:17:04.099
Shit.

01:17:14.378 --> 01:17:15.546
Get the fuck out of the car!

01:17:16.147 --> 01:17:17.082
Get out!

01:17:17.348 --> 01:17:18.350
Get on the ground!

01:17:21.419 --> 01:17:23.252
Answer the phone!

01:17:23.254 --> 01:17:24.389
Answer the phone!

01:17:32.362 --> 01:17:33.962
Hey, we're tracking
Riley's phone.

01:17:33.964 --> 01:17:35.900
It looks like he took
her to Phi Lambda.

01:17:36.133 --> 01:17:37.466
You're right around the corner.

01:17:37.468 --> 01:17:38.436
I'm gonna get units
out right away.

01:17:51.448 --> 01:17:52.384
Get out of the fucking car.

01:17:53.416 --> 01:17:54.486
Get out! Get out!

01:17:55.585 --> 01:17:56.987
Get the fuck out.

01:18:00.892 --> 01:18:02.961
Get out of the fucking car!

01:18:44.134 --> 01:18:45.302
Stand down, he's mine.

01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:47.472
You can have me, Detective Cole.

01:18:48.238 --> 01:18:49.907
But I'll be covered
in the blood of your daughter,

01:18:50.174 --> 01:18:51.476
holding her head
in my fucking hands.

01:18:51.976 --> 01:18:53.277
Go ahead, man. Touch the gun,

01:18:53.710 --> 01:18:55.677
and I'll cut her goddamned
head off,

01:18:55.679 --> 01:18:57.648
right here
on the motherfucking Row.

01:18:59.616 --> 01:19:02.219
Maybe I'll do it anyway.
That was the plan.

01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:05.223
Let her go! I'll kill you
right here, right now.

01:19:05.423 --> 01:19:06.925
You sure about that, boss?

01:19:07.258 --> 01:19:08.623
Your hands look
a little unsteady there.

01:19:08.625 --> 01:19:10.292
You sure you're not gonna
hit your daughter

01:19:10.294 --> 01:19:11.528
like that fucking cop you shot?

01:19:12.495 --> 01:19:14.730
Whatever Margaux may have done
to your sister,

01:19:14.732 --> 01:19:16.632
- she was sorry.
- Sorry?

01:19:16.634 --> 01:19:18.967
Your apologies are useless!
They're just fucking words!

01:19:18.969 --> 01:19:20.601
You're not the only one
who lost somebody, Miller.

01:19:20.603 --> 01:19:22.173
Margaux killed herself too.

01:19:24.174 --> 01:19:26.675
Riley lost her mother.
I lost my wife.

01:19:26.677 --> 01:19:29.511
You're just too fucking much.
This is too fun.

01:19:29.513 --> 01:19:31.379
I'm the one who killed
that bitch.

01:19:31.381 --> 01:19:33.181
I may not have known much
when I was a kid,

01:19:33.183 --> 01:19:34.615
but I knew how to light a match

01:19:34.617 --> 01:19:36.651
and I knew how to cover
my fucking tracks!

01:19:36.653 --> 01:19:38.153
And that should have
been the end of it,

01:19:38.155 --> 01:19:39.925
but little fucking Riley here

01:19:40.290 --> 01:19:42.459
decided to follow
in Mommy's footsteps

01:19:42.727 --> 01:19:45.430
and join the other
zombie bitches of Phi Lambda.

01:19:46.229 --> 01:19:47.562
That's when I knew.

01:19:47.564 --> 01:19:49.634
Killing your fucking cunt
of a mother...

01:19:50.567 --> 01:19:51.669
was not gonna be enough.

01:20:17.594 --> 01:20:18.562
It's over now.

01:20:26.504 --> 01:20:27.539
It's okay, baby.

01:21:03.773 --> 01:21:05.509
- Oh!
- I'm sorry.

01:21:06.443 --> 01:21:07.745
Come here, my rushing queen.

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:11.549
Soft hugs. There we go.

01:21:12.616 --> 01:21:14.052
I don't know what came over me.

01:21:14.384 --> 01:21:16.185
Okay. Okay, gimps.

01:21:16.187 --> 01:21:17.453
Let's cut the waterworks.
We're gonna have a great year.

01:21:17.455 --> 01:21:19.024
We better.

01:21:20.325 --> 01:21:22.527
You are the first freshman ever
allowed to live in Phi Lambda.

01:21:22.826 --> 01:21:25.030
Not to mention
your new street cred.

01:21:27.231 --> 01:21:30.101
We're the baddest bitches
on the Row!
