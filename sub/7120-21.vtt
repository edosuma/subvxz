same dream, dude.

They're fine.

02:30.086 --> 02:30.917
Okay, Jake.

02:30.986 --> 02:32.783
What happens when you eat food?

02:32.854 --> 02:35.413
Well, it goes into your stomach.

02:35.489 --> 02:36.787
Ye-e-e-e-ah?

02:36.857 --> 02:39.485
And then it stays
there for a bit.

And then it turns into...

02:42.127 --> 02:45.494
They're all gonna
turn into the stuff!

02:45.563 --> 02:47.030
Hey, excuse me.

02:47.097 --> 02:47.928
Excuse me.

02:47.997 --> 02:49.931
I don't know why you don't know

02:49.998 --> 02:51.933
this, but y'all are partyin' in

02:52.000 --> 02:53.297
a monster's stomach.

02:53.367 --> 02:55.631
Thanks! I love dancing!

No!

02:59.004 --> 03:02.371
In a monster's... stomach!

03:02.440 --> 03:06.534
I think he wants to know
where the bathroom is!

03:06.609 --> 03:09.874
It's over there!

03:09.945 --> 03:12.379
Hey!

03:12.446 --> 03:13.277
I'm Cubby.

03:13.347 --> 03:14.474
Hi, Cubby.

03:14.548 --> 03:15.947
What's going on?

03:16.015 --> 03:17.539
I heard what you said...

03:17.616 --> 03:19.710
About this being a
monster's belly.

03:19.785 --> 03:22.481
I've been telling everyone
that for three days!

03:22.553 --> 03:24.282
Why won't they listen?

03:24.354 --> 03:25.686
'Cause I'm just a kid!

03:25.756 --> 03:26.586
Cubby!

03:26.655 --> 03:30.352
Are you bothering these guys
with your fantasy stories?

03:30.425 --> 03:32.552
No! I wasn't! I swear!

03:32.626 --> 03:34.151
I'm dancing. See?

03:34.228 --> 03:36.492
See?!

03:36.562 --> 03:39.326
Hmm.

03:39.397 --> 03:42.491
Cubby, is there anything
we can do to help?

03:42.566 --> 03:44.363
<i>You could talk to Party Pat.</i>

03:44.434 --> 03:45.731
"Party Pat"?

03:45.801 --> 03:46.928
He's our Chief.

03:47.002 --> 03:51.132
If you can convince him to
leave, all will follow.

03:51.204 --> 03:52.467
Can you take us to him?

03:52.539 --> 03:55.906
Sure! He sleeps on
the monster's heart.

03:55.975 --> 03:58.000
It's like a blood water bed.

04:01.378 --> 04:03.107
This is as far as I go.

04:03.179 --> 04:05.875
Party Pat is right
around this corner.

04:05.947 --> 04:06.971
Bye, you guys!

04:07.048 --> 04:08.447
Bye, Cubby!

04:08.516 --> 04:10.075
Bye!

04:12.352 --> 04:13.285
Uh...

04:13.353 --> 04:15.184
We're looking for Party Pat?

04:20.957 --> 04:22.891
Oh. Uh...

04:22.958 --> 04:25.449
Well, listen, I know you
don't know us, sir,

04:25.527 --> 04:27.587
but we need to talk.

04:29.363 --> 04:30.540
It's pretty important, actually.

04:30.564 --> 04:32.031
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

04:32.098 --> 04:33.361
You know who I am?

04:33.431 --> 04:36.026
You're... Party Pat?

04:36.101 --> 04:38.126
I'm the Chief.

04:38.202 --> 04:39.294
Ri-i-i-i-ght. Right.

04:39.369 --> 04:41.133
You're the Chief.

04:41.204 --> 04:43.638
Shh.

04:43.705 --> 04:45.969
Before you talk to the Chief...

04:46.040 --> 04:47.632
you must party with the Chief.

04:47.707 --> 04:48.606
But...

04:48.675 --> 04:49.904

05:41.509 --> 05:45.946

Hang in there, pal.

05:50.081 --> 05:51.310
Hey, Party Pat.

05:51.382 --> 05:53.680
You're the Chief, and
I totes respect that.

05:53.750 --> 05:56.309
But what we have to tell
you is really important.

05:56.385 --> 05:58.615
And you said if we
partied, we could talk.

05:58.687 --> 06:00.588
But you haven't been partying.

06:00.655 --> 06:01.655
What?!

06:01.689 --> 06:04.385
You move to music, but
that's not dancing.

06:04.457 --> 06:07.551
You chew pancakes, but
you're not tasting.

06:07.626 --> 06:10.094
To truly party, one
must leave behind

06:10.161 --> 06:16.121
the problems that are troubling
and open one's mind eye.

06:16.198 --> 06:17.995
I'm just kiddin'.

06:18.066 --> 06:19.591
You guys are party animals.

06:19.667 --> 06:22.534
This is just a sticker.

06:22.603 --> 06:25.436
You can stay in our cave
as long as you want.

06:25.504 --> 06:28.166
That's what I've been
trying to tell you, man!

06:28.240 --> 06:29.605
This isn't a cave!

06:29.673 --> 06:33.074
Y'all are partyin' in
a monster's belly!

06:33.142 --> 06:36.202
Oh, yeah. That makes sense.

06:36.278 --> 06:38.678
It's definitely the weirdest
cave I've ever seen.

06:40.047 --> 06:41.344
So you'll tell
everyone to leave?

06:41.414 --> 06:43.644
Nah, we love it here.

06:43.716 --> 06:46.116
But you're all gonna
die if you stay!

06:49.453 --> 06:50.477
Attention.

06:50.554 --> 06:51.748
Attention, everybody.

06:51.821 --> 06:53.187
Can I have your
attention, please?

06:53.256 --> 06:56.123
So... apparently
we're not in a cave.

06:57.591 --> 06:59.169
- We're not in a cave?
- What did he say?

06:59.193 --> 07:00.302
I always thought
we were in a cave.

07:00.326 --> 07:03.386
We're in a... monster's belly!

07:16.604 --> 07:18.162
It's kind of peaceful.

07:20.573 --> 07:23.406
All those bears are gonna
turn into the stuff.

07:23.475 --> 07:24.475
Shh!

07:24.542 --> 07:26.476
Seriously, the only foreseeable

07:26.543 --> 07:28.875
threat might be all these
trees being swallowed.

07:28.945 --> 07:30.225
But they're not hurtin' nothin'.

07:30.280 --> 07:31.280
Yeah.

07:31.346 --> 07:33.837
Good thing he isn't swallowing
some deadly volcano lava.

07:33.915 --> 07:36.009
That would kill them for sure.

07:36.083 --> 07:39.279
Whoa!

07:39.351 --> 07:41.843
The monster's headed
toward that volcano!

07:41.921 --> 07:43.047
Uh-huh.

07:43.121 --> 07:45.214
We got to warn the bears!

07:49.992 --> 07:52.017

09:05.941 --> 09:07.461
Party Pat, do you
know of another exit?

09:07.508 --> 09:08.407
Well, there's the dark and

09:08.476 --> 09:10.467
mysterious mine, but
nobody uses it anymore.

09:12.112 --> 09:14.171
He must be talking about
the butt intestines.

09:14.246 --> 09:15.846
Come on, Jake! We got
to get out of here!

09:32.257 --> 09:36.193
One more bandage.

09:36.260 --> 09:38.057
Huzzah!

09:38.128 --> 09:39.926

safe, Party Pat!

09:39.997 --> 09:41.259
Y'all can party out here now.

09:44.733 --> 09:45.860
No.

09:45.933 --> 09:49.528
To survive, my people need a
phat party club to grind in.

09:49.602 --> 09:52.696
That monster's gut was
totally excellent.

09:52.771 --> 09:54.398
You're sick, Party Pat.

09:54.472 --> 09:56.703
I'm gonna go watch TV.

09:56.774 --> 09:58.469
Hmm.

10:00.976 --> 10:04.412
Pat, he's not gonna let
you back in his mouth.

10:04.479 --> 10:06.606
You scorched it all
up with fireworks!

10:06.680 --> 10:08.545
Unless...

10:08.614 --> 10:09.638
Party Pat!

10:11.583 --> 10:12.607
Party...

10:12.684 --> 10:14.709
Pancakes.

10:17.854 --> 10:19.652
Hear me, monster.

10:19.721 --> 10:23.487
My people and I wish to
party inside you once more!

10:23.557 --> 10:25.855
Prithee, take us upon thine gut,

10:25.925 --> 10:29.224
and we shall party no
more with fireworks,

10:29.294 --> 10:33.196
but instead with gentle lasers!
