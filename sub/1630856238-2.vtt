TERRY:
Here we go.

00:04.750 --> 00:05.708
STEVE:
There's wood. We got it.

00:05.917 --> 00:07.292
TERRY:
There it is, guys.

00:07.458 --> 00:09.167
-Wow.
-We must be close to
some type of a structure.

00:09.333 --> 00:11.000
MARTY:
There could be some
treasure just below us.

00:11.208 --> 00:13.667
-Hey, Laird.
-Yeah?

00:13.875 --> 00:16.792
JAMIE:
This is definitely the largest
artifact we've found here.

00:16.958 --> 00:18.708
-What?
-Come on. Be something.

00:18.875 --> 00:20.833
Look at that.
It's old.

00:20.958 --> 00:22.167
Emma, what have we learned?

00:22.375 --> 00:24.375
So, right now, I am finding

00:24.542 --> 00:27.375
something that
I was not expecting.

00:31.125 --> 00:34.125
NARRATOR:
There is an island
in the North Atlantic

00:34.292 --> 00:36.542
where people
have been looking for

00:36.708 --> 00:40.542
an incredible treasure
for more than 200 years.

00:40.708 --> 00:43.458
So far, they have found
a stone slab

00:43.625 --> 00:45.750
with strange symbols
carved into it...

00:47.083 --> 00:50.208
...man-made workings
that date to medieval times,

00:50.333 --> 00:54.708
and a lead cross
whose origin may be connected

00:54.875 --> 00:55.833
to the Knights Templar.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.750
To date, six men have died

00:58.917 --> 01:01.500
trying to solve the mystery.

01:01.667 --> 01:06.792
And according to legend,
one more will have to die

01:06.958 --> 01:09.375
before the treasure
can be found.

CHARLES:
Here we go!

-TERRY: All right.

01:30.167 --> 01:31.792
-Here we go.
-60.

01:31.958 --> 01:34.083
Thank you.

01:34.208 --> 01:36.667
-That's pretty firm stuff there.
-Yep.

01:36.875 --> 01:38.125
There is a lot of room yet

01:38.292 --> 01:40.792
-for something to show itself.
-ALEX: Yep.

NARRATOR: It is the start
of a new day on Oak Island

01:43.375 --> 01:47.500
for brothers Rick
and Marty Lagina and their team.

01:47.667 --> 01:49.500
One that begins
with renewed optimism

01:49.667 --> 01:51.833
that they are finally
on the verge

01:52.000 --> 01:55.750
of solving
a 228-year-old mystery.

01:55.875 --> 01:59.000
TERRY: I think it has
the possibility to intersect

01:59.208 --> 02:00.208
the Garden Shaft tunnel,

02:00.375 --> 02:02.042
-leading to or seeking
-Yeah.

02:02.208 --> 02:04.000
-the treasure chamber.
-Yeah.

02:04.208 --> 02:05.833
It may put some answers
to that tunnel down there.

02:06.042 --> 02:08.167
We don't have enough
information in the area.

02:08.292 --> 02:09.667
We don't have a start point,

02:09.875 --> 02:11.333
-we don't have an end point.
-No. That's right.

02:11.500 --> 02:13.333
We as a group have not
explored much up here.

02:13.500 --> 02:16.292
-This is a plausible location.
-Yes.

02:16.458 --> 02:18.583
NARRATOR: Currently,
the team is drilling

02:18.750 --> 02:24.208
a borehole on their strategic
grid known as D.5N-26.5.

02:24.417 --> 02:26.333
Located several feet east

02:26.542 --> 02:28.417
of the mid-18th century
structure

02:28.583 --> 02:30.167
known as "the Garden Shaft,"

02:30.375 --> 02:32.333
it is their hope
that this new borehole

02:32.542 --> 02:34.375
will encounter
a mysterious tunnel

02:34.542 --> 02:36.000
that they previously discovered

02:36.208 --> 02:38.333
at a depth of 95 feet.

02:38.500 --> 02:41.250
A tunnel which is believed
to run directly west

02:41.375 --> 02:43.458
beneath the Garden Shaft
and into an area

02:43.583 --> 02:45.542
that has been dubbed
"the Baby Blob,"

02:45.708 --> 02:49.250
where water tests
conducted one year ago

02:49.375 --> 02:51.000
revealed high-trace evidence

02:51.167 --> 02:53.917
of silver, gold
and other metals

02:54.083 --> 02:58.083
between 80 and 120 feet
below ground.

02:58.542 --> 03:01.250
Last year we were
able to concentrate

03:01.417 --> 03:04.833
and be very confident
in the Baby Blob area.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.292
That's right.

03:06.500 --> 03:08.250
NARRATOR:
However, when the team met

03:08.458 --> 03:10.583
with geoscientist
Dr. Ian Spooner

03:10.750 --> 03:12.125
and his colleague,

03:12.250 --> 03:15.667
hydrogeologist Dr. Fred Michel
last week,

03:15.833 --> 03:19.083
the two presented
their updated testing analysis,

03:19.292 --> 03:21.458
which suggested
that the fabled treasure

03:21.542 --> 03:23.625
could actually
lie buried anywhere

03:23.792 --> 03:26.458
within a 20-foot radius
of the feature.

03:26.583 --> 03:29.417
Nothing is dissuading us
from our opinion

03:29.542 --> 03:32.250
that there's an area
around the Garden Shaft

03:32.375 --> 03:34.333
where something's
been deposited.

03:34.458 --> 03:36.750
Well, that I consider
very good news.

03:36.875 --> 03:38.500
Yeah.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.875
NARRATOR:
Now, while the team
awaits a new permit

03:42.042 --> 03:45.750
to deepen the Garden Shaft
by approximately 20 feet,

03:45.875 --> 03:49.208
which will also allow them
to construct lateral tunnels

03:49.417 --> 03:51.750
in order to reach
potential targets,

03:51.917 --> 03:53.625
Rick, Marty and the team

03:53.750 --> 03:56.417
are looking for
any evidence of valuables

03:56.583 --> 03:58.750
more than 100 feet underground

03:58.875 --> 04:02.375
that might be located
to the east of the shaft.

04:02.542 --> 04:05.167
MARTY:
The tunnel that goes
under the Garden Shaft

04:05.375 --> 04:07.000
doesn't appear
in the literature anywhere,

04:07.167 --> 04:08.500
doesn't appear in the records,

04:08.625 --> 04:10.292
so that's the one
I'm most interested in.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.083
So, we need to keep going.

04:12.208 --> 04:15.583
That, perhaps,
could go off to a chamber.

04:15.750 --> 04:18.375
Meaning, there could be some
actual treasure just below us.

04:18.542 --> 04:21.417
And we're gonna
find that out this year.

04:23.208 --> 04:24.125
STEVE:
Hey, Mike.
What do we got?

04:24.292 --> 04:26.000
-78.
-78.

04:26.167 --> 04:28.125
78.

04:28.292 --> 04:29.875
SCOTT:
Anyone got a knife?

04:32.042 --> 04:33.000
TERRY:
I love this hole.

04:33.167 --> 04:34.125
We are in the middle of all

04:34.333 --> 04:36.167
of the very, very soft material.

04:36.375 --> 04:41.042
And this to my eye
is relatively soft.

04:41.250 --> 04:42.583
What do you think, Scott?

04:42.708 --> 04:44.125
SCOTT: There is a lot
going on in this area,

04:44.333 --> 04:45.542
I mean, that we really
don't know about.

04:45.667 --> 04:47.333
-There's a lot
of possibilities.
-Absolutely.

04:47.500 --> 04:49.375
Yeah, we've seen that whenever
we're near a structure.

04:49.542 --> 04:52.083
-Yeah.
-We could be coming down
on the intersection

04:52.250 --> 04:54.000
-of the tunnel here.
-For sure.

04:54.208 --> 04:55.708
TERRY:
Time is going to tell.

04:55.917 --> 04:57.792
We are going to do the work
that's gonna find that out.

04:57.958 --> 04:59.917
NARRATOR:
While the drilling
operation continues

05:00.042 --> 05:03.500
in the Money Pit area,
on Lot 5,

05:03.708 --> 05:05.667
located on the western side
of the island...

05:05.875 --> 05:08.167
-JACK: Here he comes.
-LAIRD: Oh, yeah.

05:08.333 --> 05:10.917
NARRATOR: ...Marty Lagina
joins Jack Begley,

05:11.042 --> 05:12.625
archaeologist Laird Niven,

05:12.750 --> 05:14.167
Jamie Kouba

05:14.333 --> 05:15.958
and their assistant Fiona Steele

05:16.125 --> 05:18.167
as they continue investigating

05:18.375 --> 05:20.958
a strange, circular feature.

05:21.083 --> 05:23.333
Okay, Laird.
What's the mission?

05:23.542 --> 05:25.167
LAIRD:
All right.

05:25.375 --> 05:26.708
We're going to do
the big rocks in the interior.

05:26.875 --> 05:27.917
Show me.

05:29.583 --> 05:31.625
-Oh, yeah. There are
some big rocks in there.
-Yeah.

05:31.792 --> 05:34.167
-MARTY: You want
all that out, right?
-LAIRD: Yeah.

05:34.333 --> 05:36.167
I-I don't know why
it's filled with rocks.

05:36.375 --> 05:38.375
But underneath all those,

05:38.542 --> 05:40.333
we think there's
that intact layer

05:40.542 --> 05:43.000
that we want to get to.

05:43.167 --> 05:46.000
-That will help tell us
exactly what this feature is.
-Yeah. Yeah.

05:46.167 --> 05:47.292
MARTY:
Interesting.

05:47.458 --> 05:48.625
Just keeps getting
more interesting.

05:48.792 --> 05:51.667
-Yeah. Okay.
-Okay, I can do that.

05:51.833 --> 05:54.167
NARRATOR:
Since the Laginas'
and their partners' purchase

05:54.375 --> 05:56.500
of Lot 5 one year ago,

05:56.625 --> 05:58.958
Laird and his colleagues
have been mystified

05:59.125 --> 06:00.542
by the unique construction

06:00.708 --> 06:03.167
of this stone-lined,
circular depression,

06:03.375 --> 06:05.167
especially
when it was determined

06:05.375 --> 06:07.083
to have a 13-foot diameter,

06:07.292 --> 06:08.458
which matched the description

06:08.542 --> 06:10.125
of the original Money Pit

06:10.292 --> 06:13.375
when it was
first discovered in 1795.

06:13.542 --> 06:15.792
However, one week ago,

06:15.958 --> 06:17.917
the team discovered
a piece of pottery

06:18.042 --> 06:21.458
that could date back to
as early as the 17th century,

06:21.625 --> 06:24.333
along with an iron latch.

06:24.500 --> 06:26.333
A latch that when analyzed

06:26.500 --> 06:28.750
by archaeometallurgist
Emma Culligan,

06:28.875 --> 06:31.833
was determined to have
the exact same composition

06:31.917 --> 06:34.708
as other artifacts
directly connected

06:34.875 --> 06:36.250
to Sir William Phips,

06:36.458 --> 06:40.917
the 17th century English
politician and privateer

06:41.083 --> 06:42.417
who is believed by some

06:42.583 --> 06:44.375
to have buried treasure
in the Money Pit

06:44.542 --> 06:46.833
around 1687.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.667
LAIRD:
We have a big rock here,
right in the wall.

06:50.875 --> 06:52.667
Maybe if you can
tickle it out a bit.

06:52.792 --> 06:55.125
-Oh, I'm sure I can.
-(Laird laughs)

06:57.542 --> 06:59.375
-FIONA: Yes.
-JAMIE: Nice.

06:59.542 --> 07:01.500
MARTY:
We've got a very mysterious,

07:01.708 --> 07:04.250
very old
round rock structure

07:04.417 --> 07:06.208
which is still being excavated,

07:06.375 --> 07:08.208
but it's full of artifacts,

07:08.375 --> 07:10.917
with no record
of human habitation.

07:12.167 --> 07:13.917
Then Laird
lets me know that

07:14.083 --> 07:15.833
I can do something I am fond of,

07:15.917 --> 07:17.958
which is to pull
the big rocks, at least, off

07:18.125 --> 07:19.500
with the backhoe.

07:19.625 --> 07:21.792
FIONA:
Well, that really helps.

07:21.958 --> 07:23.417
MARTY:
And that is going to get

07:23.583 --> 07:25.125
the ball rolling really fast

07:25.333 --> 07:27.667
and so I'm eager to do it.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.583
Yeah, that's it, right?

07:32.750 --> 07:34.750
-LAIRD: Yep. That's good.
-Okay.

07:36.833 --> 07:40.583
LAIRD:
We're starting
to see a wall. Maybe?

07:40.750 --> 07:43.667
There should be
another 90-degree corner

07:43.875 --> 07:45.708
-somewhere over there?
-That's the hope.

07:45.917 --> 07:48.833
So, ideally, we'd find the base
of a nice structure here.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.708
MARTY:
It's pretty kind of
hard to believe.

07:50.875 --> 07:52.500
I mean, this is massive
and yet not...

07:52.667 --> 07:54.167
not any reference to it.

07:54.375 --> 07:56.375
-Yeah.
-It, yeah, it's very odd.

07:56.583 --> 07:59.042
It was quite an occupation
for the time. Isn't it?

07:59.208 --> 08:01.750
Yeah, it was
a substantial structure.

08:01.875 --> 08:04.292
People weren't here
for just a month, were they?

08:04.458 --> 08:06.833
-JAMIE: No.
-No.

08:07.042 --> 08:08.333
I mean, we really
don't know what

08:08.500 --> 08:09.583
this structure
was used for at all.

08:09.708 --> 08:11.375
LAIRD:
Not at the moment, no.

08:11.542 --> 08:12.333
JACK:
Because there could have
been some feature here

08:12.500 --> 08:13.708
-that was older.
-Yeah.

08:13.875 --> 08:16.375
That's why we need
to get rid of this stuff

08:16.542 --> 08:18.833
and come down on the good stuff.

08:19.042 --> 08:21.417
I think, Jamie,
the first thing you work on

08:21.583 --> 08:24.250
is to the right
where the rock came out of.

08:24.375 --> 08:25.833
JAMIE:
Yeah, absolutely.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.333
That's gonna be my first area
of attack for sure.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.167
-Yeah.
-MARTY: Okay.

08:30.292 --> 08:33.625
Well, I'm hoping it yields
some clues to what we're after.

08:33.792 --> 08:35.542
-Carry on.
-All right, thank you.

08:35.708 --> 08:36.917
-Thanks, Marty.
-Yeah.

08:37.083 --> 08:38.000
JAMIE:
Thank you.

08:38.167 --> 08:39.792
LAIRD:
All right. In we go.

08:39.917 --> 08:42.542
The ultimate goal is to find

08:42.708 --> 08:44.583
artifacts at the bottom
of the feature

08:44.708 --> 08:46.625
and get a better idea

08:46.792 --> 08:48.167
of when this structure
was built.

08:48.375 --> 08:50.792
We know nothing about it.

08:50.958 --> 08:52.708
We don't know who was there.

08:52.875 --> 08:55.250
Uh, we don't know
why they were there.

08:55.417 --> 08:56.667
And we don't know
when they were there.

08:56.875 --> 08:58.958
So, this is a first step for us

08:59.167 --> 09:01.917
to solving those questions.

09:03.333 --> 09:06.000
Oh. Hey, Laird.

09:06.208 --> 09:07.917
Yep.

09:08.083 --> 09:10.000
You might want to stop
what you're doing

09:10.083 --> 09:12.000
and come take a look
at this, my friend.

09:13.792 --> 09:17.083
This is definitely the largest
artifact we've found here.

09:17.208 --> 09:18.042
I can guarantee that.

09:18.208 --> 09:19.667
What?

09:20.667 --> 09:22.875
-JAMIE: How about that?
-LAIRD: Oh, wow.

09:27.042 --> 09:28.042
FIONA: You think you can get it
out in one piece?
-Oh, yeah.

09:28.208 --> 09:30.500
FIONA:
Oh, lovely!

09:30.708 --> 09:32.667
JAMIE:
This is incredible!

09:32.792 --> 09:34.500
NARRATOR: While investigating

09:34.667 --> 09:37.417
the mysterious circular
feature on Lot 5,

09:37.583 --> 09:39.833
Jack Begley
and members of the team

09:40.042 --> 09:43.625
have just made a potentially
important discovery.

09:43.792 --> 09:46.708
JACK:
That is a big piece
of pottery, isn't it?

09:46.917 --> 09:48.458
LAIRD:
It's coarse earthenware.

09:48.625 --> 09:51.208
-We call it Anglo American ware.
-JAMIE: Okay.

09:51.375 --> 09:53.333
LAIRD:
So, it's either from England

09:53.500 --> 09:56.833
or it's from
possibly Pennsylvania.

09:56.958 --> 10:00.333
Uh, would've been
a large cooking vessel.

10:00.542 --> 10:02.375
When do you think
that'd date to?

10:02.542 --> 10:06.500
So, very broadly,
second half of the 1700s,

10:06.708 --> 10:09.000
-like maybe 1770s.
-Oh, wow.

10:09.208 --> 10:11.125
NARRATOR:
A large piece of pottery,

10:11.333 --> 10:14.083
that may predate
the discovery of the Money Pit

10:14.250 --> 10:16.333
by more than two decades?

10:16.500 --> 10:20.167
Was it left behind by those
who created this feature?

10:20.292 --> 10:23.667
Or by someone who found it
already in place?

10:23.833 --> 10:25.708
LAIRD:
Cool. You have a bag?

10:25.875 --> 10:27.333
FIONA:
I do. It's over in my knapsack.

10:27.542 --> 10:29.000
All right. I'll go put it there.

10:29.208 --> 10:30.458
-Thanks.
-Great find.

10:30.625 --> 10:32.167
Okay, let's find
the rest of it now.

10:32.375 --> 10:35.417
NARRATOR:
As Jack Begley
and members of the team

10:35.583 --> 10:36.958
look for additional clues

10:37.083 --> 10:39.583
in the circular depression
on Lot 5...

10:39.750 --> 10:42.500
-Away we go, mate!
-RICK: Okay.

10:42.708 --> 10:44.833
NARRATOR:
...less than 100 yards away

10:44.958 --> 10:46.500
Rick Lagina and Gary Drayton

10:46.667 --> 10:48.292
are searching an area

10:48.500 --> 10:50.750
where they have made some
of the oldest discoveries

10:50.875 --> 10:53.667
ever documented
not only on Oak Island

10:53.792 --> 10:56.083
but in all of North America.

10:56.292 --> 10:58.542
RICK:
You're about due
for a coin, Gary.

10:58.708 --> 11:01.542
I am, overdue a coin.

11:01.667 --> 11:04.625
-Yay! It's a coin!
-(laughter)

11:04.792 --> 11:06.333
NARRATOR:
One week ago,

11:06.542 --> 11:08.167
Gary, along with Rick,

11:08.292 --> 11:10.667
Marty and their partner
Craig Tester...

11:10.875 --> 11:13.333
SANDY:
This is clearly Roman design.

11:13.458 --> 11:16.958
-(laughter)
-Roman, baby!

11:17.125 --> 11:20.333
NARRATOR:
...unearthed four
ancient coins in this area,

11:20.500 --> 11:22.042
making a total of five

11:22.208 --> 11:24.667
that have been discovered
in the past year.

11:24.833 --> 11:26.833
Incredibly,
three of these coins

11:27.042 --> 11:29.833
have been determined
by numismatist Sandy Campbell

11:29.958 --> 11:34.708
to date between
500 AD and 300 BC

11:34.833 --> 11:37.917
and to also be of Roman origin.

11:39.750 --> 11:42.333
RICK:
Lot 5 is a complete mystery.

11:42.458 --> 11:46.375
It's a mystery in terms
of the man-made constructs,

11:46.542 --> 11:48.042
uh, the kinds of artifacts

11:48.208 --> 11:49.500
that have come out
of the ground,

11:49.667 --> 11:51.500
it's mystifying.

11:51.667 --> 11:54.583
GARY:
It's got to come out,
'cause I don't know what it is.

11:54.750 --> 11:57.083
-Right in the middle, mate.
-Okay.

12:07.625 --> 12:09.375
GARY:
Thank you, sir.

12:09.583 --> 12:11.000
(detector beeping)

12:11.167 --> 12:13.792
Sounds a little bit better now.

12:15.042 --> 12:17.375
(beeping)

12:20.792 --> 12:22.375
RICK:
Come on, be something.

12:24.750 --> 12:27.250
Some kind of strap.

12:28.542 --> 12:31.625
And this looks like
it goes down,

12:31.792 --> 12:34.583
like to a point there,
and then down there.

12:34.750 --> 12:38.125
It's almost decorative.
Like a decorative strap.

12:38.250 --> 12:39.833
RICK:
Mm-hmm. Yeah, it could be
just something

12:40.042 --> 12:41.833
broken off of something else.

12:42.042 --> 12:48.000
Yeah, a lot of these straps
were around boxes, or chests.

12:48.083 --> 12:51.000
-That would be cool.
-There you go.

12:51.125 --> 12:53.958
I would imagine this has
something to do with whatever

12:54.125 --> 12:57.042
that depression is over there.

12:57.208 --> 13:00.333
NARRATOR: A strap?
Possibly from a box?

13:00.542 --> 13:01.500
Or chest?

13:01.708 --> 13:03.750
Could Gary be correct

13:03.917 --> 13:05.500
that it might be related

13:05.667 --> 13:07.750
to the nearby
circular depression?

13:07.917 --> 13:10.333
Or might it
possibly be connected

13:10.542 --> 13:12.208
to the numerous Roman coins

13:12.375 --> 13:14.750
that the team
has found in this area?

13:15.375 --> 13:18.625
GARY:
That CT scanner will give us
a good view of this.

13:18.792 --> 13:21.667
At that point, you no longer
have to speculate

13:21.792 --> 13:25.000
as to what it is, you speculate
as to its purpose.

13:25.167 --> 13:27.667
-Yeah.
-RICK: The information that Emma

13:27.875 --> 13:30.292
and the, uh, CT scan
will provide,

13:30.458 --> 13:33.333
might be very highly
revealing what it means

13:33.542 --> 13:34.958
to the feature on Lot 5.

13:35.083 --> 13:36.833
You can't argue
with the science.

13:36.958 --> 13:38.583
It will be what it will be,

13:38.750 --> 13:41.042
and hopefully that information

13:41.208 --> 13:43.208
connects up
to the greater mystery.

13:43.375 --> 13:46.500
GARY:
Let's see if we can
rustle up another find.

13:46.667 --> 13:48.583
(detector beeping)

13:48.750 --> 13:50.667
(beeping rapidly)

13:50.750 --> 13:53.000
We've got something
in this area.

13:53.167 --> 13:55.792
Let me just brush the stuff away

13:56.000 --> 13:58.208
and then take
another swing, all right?

14:00.708 --> 14:02.208
(detector beeping)

14:02.375 --> 14:06.792
Not sure what it is.
It's this side of that root.

14:08.375 --> 14:10.792
(grunts) Wow.

14:13.500 --> 14:16.208
It's not an easy one.

14:18.875 --> 14:20.583
GARY:
Huh.

14:20.708 --> 14:23.708
(detector beeping)

14:23.875 --> 14:26.417
Think it's out.

14:26.583 --> 14:31.500
-Could be iron.
-(beeping)

14:31.625 --> 14:33.250
It is iron.

14:34.417 --> 14:36.417
Chunky iron. Look at that.

14:36.542 --> 14:38.958
The heck is that?

14:40.750 --> 14:42.000
No idea.

14:42.167 --> 14:44.833
-Heavy?
-Oh, yeah. It's heavy.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.583
Well, I believe
this is some kind of fastener

14:47.792 --> 14:49.417
by the look of it.

14:49.542 --> 14:52.042
-Mm-hmm.
-And it could be
a rose-head type fastener.

14:52.208 --> 14:53.958
It's old.

14:54.042 --> 14:56.667
A lot of that old,
hand-forged iron

14:56.833 --> 14:58.375
tends to be on the heavy side.

14:58.542 --> 15:00.333
RICK:
Well, we're close

15:00.542 --> 15:02.667
to the most prominent
feature on Lot 5, right?

15:02.833 --> 15:05.125
And if there was a structure,

15:05.333 --> 15:06.667
what do you need to put
a structure together?

15:06.833 --> 15:08.792
-The fasteners, right?
-Yeah.

15:08.958 --> 15:11.167
RICK:
Why are we finding bits of iron

15:11.292 --> 15:13.875
on lots where
significant finds are made?

15:14.042 --> 15:16.625
It is very strange
given the fact that

15:16.792 --> 15:18.625
iron was a valuable resource,

15:18.792 --> 15:21.500
and you wouldn't just waste it.

15:21.667 --> 15:23.667
So, what is the explanation?

15:23.792 --> 15:25.250
As of yet,
I don't think we know.

15:25.417 --> 15:28.083
And these are the type of things
that you show to Carmen.

15:28.250 --> 15:30.167
And you never know, it could be

15:30.375 --> 15:32.792
more than what we believe it is.

15:32.958 --> 15:35.250
-Adding to the story on Lot 5.
-Yep.

15:36.417 --> 15:38.000
Emma's gonna be busy.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.417
NARRATOR:
Later that afternoon...

15:43.917 --> 15:45.000
TERRY:
This is the one, gentlemen.

15:45.125 --> 15:46.917
This could be
the one, right here.

15:49.708 --> 15:50.958
-Hi, guys.
-Oh, hi, guys.

15:51.167 --> 15:52.750
-Hey.
-What's going on?

15:52.875 --> 15:54.500
Uh, we're just pushing
to 108 right now.

15:54.583 --> 15:58.375
NARRATOR:
...Marty Lagina
and his son Alex

15:58.542 --> 16:00.375
join Craig Tester
and other members of the team

16:00.542 --> 16:02.042
in the Money Pit area.

16:02.208 --> 16:06.917
-We're going from 98 to 108.
-Okay!

16:08.792 --> 16:13.958
NARRATOR:
...as the drilling operation
in borehole D.5N-26.5

16:14.083 --> 16:15.958
has now reached the target depth

16:16.125 --> 16:17.917
where they hope
to encounter a tunnel

16:18.042 --> 16:20.750
and evidence of buried treasure.

16:21.833 --> 16:26.083
Now, this is really the money
stroke here from 98 to 108.

16:26.250 --> 16:28.000
We'll pull that up.
I mean, right there,

16:28.167 --> 16:29.167
that should have
top to bottom

16:29.375 --> 16:30.875
our intersection of the tunnel.

16:31.042 --> 16:32.667
If there is a tunnel.

16:32.792 --> 16:33.708
-What do we got, Mike?
-108.

16:33.875 --> 16:35.250
108. Great.

16:35.417 --> 16:39.500
Oh, here we go.
Another one right here.

16:39.625 --> 16:41.667
There's wood. We got it!

16:41.875 --> 16:43.333
-What?
-Really?

16:43.500 --> 16:45.333
Right on. Excellent.

16:45.542 --> 16:47.083
Wow.

16:49.167 --> 16:50.542
-106 probably?
-Yeah.

16:50.750 --> 16:51.917
Yep.

16:52.083 --> 16:53.792
It's back up higher here.

16:53.958 --> 16:55.375
There's wood there as well, yep.

16:59.083 --> 17:00.500
CHARLES:
Comin' in!

17:02.708 --> 17:06.458
-Thanks, Mike.
-Thanks, Mike.

17:06.625 --> 17:08.375
Perhaps another piece?

17:10.458 --> 17:15.333
Wow. About 106 and a half,
we intersected that beam.

17:15.458 --> 17:19.958
This does in no way resemble
soft, tight, dense maroon till.

17:20.167 --> 17:22.333
This is very soft and slushy.

17:22.458 --> 17:23.667
-Interesting.
-Terry, is that--

17:23.833 --> 17:25.042
Is that another chunk?

17:25.208 --> 17:28.125
Something there.
What's that? What's that?

17:28.250 --> 17:30.708
SCOTT:
Oh, yeah, that's a nice chunk
right there.

17:30.917 --> 17:32.542
Another good
chunk of it right here.

17:32.708 --> 17:34.000
TERRY:
Wow.

17:34.167 --> 17:36.625
SCOTT:
Lots of little flecks in here.

17:36.792 --> 17:40.125
So, we see kind of a debris
trail here, coming down.

17:40.292 --> 17:42.750
And we get bigger and bigger
as we come down

17:42.917 --> 17:43.958
toward the chunk
at the bottom here.

17:44.125 --> 17:46.417
There it is, guys.

17:46.583 --> 17:47.833
We must be close to some type
of a structure.

17:48.042 --> 17:50.625
And I'm guessing...

17:50.792 --> 17:52.250
it's probably a tunnel.

17:59.333 --> 18:00.750
TERRY:
It's got to be a tunnel.

18:00.917 --> 18:02.542
Is it the same structure?

18:02.708 --> 18:04.667
-We're not sure.
-ALEX: It's possible.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.875
NARRATOR:
In the Money Pit area,

18:07.083 --> 18:09.333
the Oak Island team
has just recovered

18:09.542 --> 18:11.292
evidence of a possible tunnel

18:11.417 --> 18:13.833
several feet east
of the Garden Shaft.

18:13.958 --> 18:15.333
The question is:

18:15.542 --> 18:17.167
could it be the same tunnel

18:17.333 --> 18:20.000
believed to run
directly below the feature

18:20.125 --> 18:21.542
and into the Baby Blob

18:21.708 --> 18:23.917
where they have detected
high-trace evidence

18:24.083 --> 18:26.458
of both silver and gold?

18:28.708 --> 18:30.792
-Hi, Rick. How you doing?
-RICK: Hey.

18:30.917 --> 18:32.208
Core is down at that end.

18:32.417 --> 18:34.750
Go on down there.
Brief him, Scott.

18:35.792 --> 18:39.583
Well, you can see in this
core we've been finding wood.

18:39.708 --> 18:43.625
It really kind of
picks up here to here.

18:43.750 --> 18:46.333
And you'll notice it's
on a pretty good line

18:46.417 --> 18:47.833
with the Garden Shaft tunnel,

18:47.958 --> 18:49.792
which we find
over on the west side.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.958
Rick, that wood right there

18:52.125 --> 18:54.167
matches pretty much exactly.

18:54.333 --> 18:56.833
Yep. This could
potentially be our first hit

18:57.042 --> 18:59.375
of the Garden Shaft tunnel
on this side.

19:01.708 --> 19:04.583
MARTY: The reason
it's likely, in my mind,

19:04.708 --> 19:06.292
that this wood
we just found is associated

19:06.500 --> 19:08.542
with the tunnel
underneath the Garden Shaft

19:08.708 --> 19:10.542
is because it lines up

19:10.708 --> 19:13.667
with other hits we have
to the west

19:13.875 --> 19:16.083
and it's at the proper depth.

19:16.292 --> 19:18.500
This one is a mystery tunnel.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.000
We don't know
where this one goes,

19:20.125 --> 19:22.750
we don't know who did it,
we don't know why.

19:22.917 --> 19:26.000
I think this thing
is proving to be very long,

19:26.208 --> 19:29.125
-and it's-it's mysterious.
-Yeah.

19:29.250 --> 19:32.833
I wonder if we couldn't
rush an expedited C-14 test.

19:33.042 --> 19:34.958
-Yes.
-Yes.

19:35.125 --> 19:39.333
The effort here is about
dating that structure.

19:39.500 --> 19:41.250
Does it reflect original work,

19:41.417 --> 19:43.333
or does it reflect
searcher work?

19:43.500 --> 19:47.292
And if it's not searcher,
it could lead to anything.

19:47.417 --> 19:49.958
It could lead
to an offset chamber.

19:50.083 --> 19:52.083
Well, I mean,
I think this is a good...

19:52.250 --> 19:53.292
a good discovery.

19:53.458 --> 19:54.958
This is the first wood

19:55.125 --> 19:56.250
we've gotten on the east side

19:56.417 --> 19:57.875
of the Garden Shaft.

19:58.042 --> 19:59.750
MARTY: Correct.
It's more verification,

19:59.875 --> 20:01.375
which makes it really exciting

20:01.542 --> 20:02.833
about what Dumas
is going to find

20:03.000 --> 20:03.917
when they go down.

20:04.083 --> 20:06.375
But we have to keep following it

20:06.500 --> 20:07.875
because it could be a tunnel

20:08.042 --> 20:09.833
to the offset chamber
that we seek.

20:10.042 --> 20:13.167
NARRATOR:
Could Marty Lagina's
assessment be correct?

20:13.333 --> 20:16.417
Is it possible that when
Dumas Contracting Limited

20:16.583 --> 20:19.375
is permitted to extend
the bottom of the Garden Shaft

20:19.542 --> 20:21.375
they will encounter a tunnel

20:21.542 --> 20:23.625
that may lead them
to the fabled treasure

20:23.792 --> 20:25.833
that people have been
trying to find

20:26.000 --> 20:27.875
for more than two centuries?

20:28.042 --> 20:29.500
MARTY:
We need to keep going.

20:29.667 --> 20:32.000
And I'd jump pretty far
this time. Like ten feet.

20:32.167 --> 20:34.292
Yep. We'll get more information

20:34.500 --> 20:36.792
the closer we get
to the Garden Shaft itself.

20:36.917 --> 20:38.917
-I agree.
-Okay. Good.

20:39.083 --> 20:42.083
Let's follow it
and see what it is.

20:42.292 --> 20:44.292
MARTY:
Okay. Let's pick a hole.

20:44.458 --> 20:46.250
STEVE:
Sounds good.

20:48.833 --> 20:50.833
NARRATOR:
The following morning...

20:52.083 --> 20:53.292
IAN:
They just pushed in, right?

20:53.375 --> 20:54.500
CHARLES:
Yeah.

20:54.667 --> 20:57.500
He's got 30 feet
of core barrel on there.

20:57.667 --> 21:00.083
NARRATOR:
...as the drilling
of a new borehole

21:00.250 --> 21:02.833
known as D.5N-25.5

21:03.000 --> 21:05.500
begins in the Money Pit area...

21:05.708 --> 21:08.083
-RICK: There he is.
-CARMEN: How are you?

21:08.250 --> 21:09.458
-Carmen.
-Hey, Carmen, how are you?

21:09.625 --> 21:11.458
-Not too bad.
-NARRATOR: Rick Lagina

21:11.667 --> 21:13.833
and members of the team meet
with blacksmithing expert

21:13.917 --> 21:17.792
Carmen Legge at the Oak Island
Interpretive Centre.

21:17.917 --> 21:20.542
As you see, we've got
a bunch of items here

21:20.708 --> 21:23.708
that have been recovered
from a specific lot of interest.

21:23.875 --> 21:25.167
I see that.

21:25.375 --> 21:26.625
NARRATOR:
Carmen has been invited

21:26.792 --> 21:29.125
to examine some of the artifacts
that were recently

21:29.292 --> 21:31.000
discovered on Lot 5,

21:31.167 --> 21:35.458
including a 17th century
iron latch that was unearthed

21:35.542 --> 21:39.208
in the mysterious circular
depression one week ago.

21:39.333 --> 21:41.333
CARMEN: Well, I'll start
with this one here,

21:41.500 --> 21:43.833
because you can see
that it's a wedge

21:44.042 --> 21:47.000
about four inches long
with a ring through it.

21:47.083 --> 21:49.667
The thickness of it
indicates that it's very old.

21:50.667 --> 21:53.000
I'd like to see the...
the scan of this,

21:53.083 --> 21:54.250
uh, up on the screen for us.

21:54.458 --> 21:56.625
Yeah, sure thing.

21:56.792 --> 21:59.417
NARRATOR: In order to help
Carmen examine the artifact,

21:59.583 --> 22:02.542
Emma Culligan is
presenting an image

22:02.708 --> 22:04.292
that she generated using

22:04.458 --> 22:07.667
the SkyScan 1273 CT scanner.

22:07.875 --> 22:11.667
The device emits
X-ray radiation,

22:11.833 --> 22:14.750
which can penetrate corrosion
and sediment on objects

22:14.958 --> 22:17.167
to produce
three-dimensional images

22:17.333 --> 22:20.083
of them and their finer details.

22:21.500 --> 22:23.125
RICK:
Does that help you at all?

22:23.292 --> 22:24.458
Oh, yes, certainly does, yeah,

22:24.625 --> 22:26.792
'cause you can see
down at the bottom there,

22:26.958 --> 22:29.792
there's a certain amount
of wear onto it as well.

22:31.542 --> 22:33.583
Hey, can you turn it around
so I can see the top?

22:37.708 --> 22:40.958
Yeah, that looks like it wasn't
used for repeated use...

22:43.750 --> 22:48.000
So it was inserted in whatever
it was into and left.

22:50.750 --> 22:52.875
It would be nice
to be able to analyze

22:53.042 --> 22:55.542
-the metal, as well.
-Emma?

22:55.708 --> 22:59.917
So, the ring bolt's got
no modern indicators.

23:00.083 --> 23:03.792
And it's got the potassium
and calcium content throughout,

23:03.958 --> 23:07.500
consistently matching
with old context metal.

23:07.708 --> 23:10.000
But the most
interesting thing about

23:10.167 --> 23:12.250
this one is that it matched,

23:12.375 --> 23:14.375
100% sensitivity,

23:14.583 --> 23:17.250
with artifacts
from the William Phips site.

23:17.417 --> 23:20.583
Yeah, at least 17th century.

23:20.750 --> 23:24.125
-Yeah.
-RICK: When William Phips
recovered

23:24.292 --> 23:26.125
gold and silver
from the Concepcíon,

23:26.333 --> 23:27.792
the salvage of the Concepcíon,

23:27.958 --> 23:31.208
there is, uh...
a growing body of evidence

23:31.375 --> 23:33.625
that perhaps he came here.

23:35.500 --> 23:37.750
We know that Phips
found silver on the Concepcíon.

23:37.958 --> 23:39.917
And I believe
some of the treasure

23:40.083 --> 23:42.458
from the Concepcíon was
secreted to Oak Island.

23:42.625 --> 23:43.958
Very interesting.

23:44.125 --> 23:45.458
NARRATOR:
In 2019,

23:45.625 --> 23:47.542
32nd-Degree Freemason

23:47.708 --> 23:50.250
Scott Clarke presented
a stunning theory

23:50.417 --> 23:52.250
to Rick and members of the team.

23:52.375 --> 23:56.167
According to his research,
in 1687,

23:56.333 --> 23:59.750
the English politician turned
privateer, Sir William Phips,

23:59.875 --> 24:02.917
conspired
with a high-ranking Freemason

24:03.042 --> 24:05.667
named Captain Andrew Belcher
to bury

24:05.833 --> 24:07.875
a vast cache of treasure
in the Money Pit,

24:08.042 --> 24:11.667
which they had salvaged
from the Concepcíon,

24:11.833 --> 24:14.542
a famed Spanish galleon
that sank

24:14.667 --> 24:16.417
off the coast
of the Dominican Republic

24:16.542 --> 24:18.583
in 1641...

24:18.750 --> 24:22.833
while transporting
more than 100 tons of gold,

24:23.042 --> 24:25.042
silver and jewels.

24:25.208 --> 24:27.833
I was contacted
by Frank White who had some

24:28.000 --> 24:31.417
archaeological artifacts from
the William Phips birthplace.

24:31.583 --> 24:34.625
NARRATOR: Since that meeting,
Emma and Laird obtained

24:34.792 --> 24:37.042
and analyzed a number
of metal artifacts

24:37.208 --> 24:40.250
that are known to have
belonged to Sir William Phips.

24:40.458 --> 24:44.542
And, incredibly, the artifact
found in the circular depression

24:44.708 --> 24:47.458
on Lot 5 is
an exact compositional match

24:47.625 --> 24:49.708
to those objects.

24:49.833 --> 24:51.292
JACK:
What would that be used for?

24:51.458 --> 24:52.458
CARMEN:
Well,

24:52.625 --> 24:54.458
the wedge part could be used

24:54.625 --> 24:56.833
for driving into wood or rock.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.500
My guess is-is,
it was driven into wood.

25:00.708 --> 25:03.583
It could be used
for many purposes.

25:16.792 --> 25:19.125
-GARY: Wow.
-JACK: Yeah!

25:23.208 --> 25:25.750
CARMEN: If you wanted to hoist
something or lower something

25:25.917 --> 25:27.833
into the ground you would
use something like that.

25:28.042 --> 25:29.958
Wow.

25:30.125 --> 25:32.500
NARRATOR: In the Oak Island
Interpretive Centre

25:32.708 --> 25:35.000
blacksmithing expert
Carmen Legge has just

25:35.208 --> 25:38.708
informed Rick Lagina
and members of the team that

25:38.875 --> 25:40.667
the metal latch found
in the circular depression

25:40.833 --> 25:44.042
on Lot 5, and which is
believed to be connected

25:44.208 --> 25:47.667
to the 17th century privateer
Sir William Phips

25:47.833 --> 25:52.167
may have been used to place
heavy cargo underground.

25:52.333 --> 25:56.792
We have the possible Phips
connection in the metallurgy,

25:56.917 --> 25:59.500
though I'm not sure
what that tells us other

25:59.667 --> 26:02.458
than that feature
continues to be interesting.

26:02.667 --> 26:05.083
GARY:
What I see here is connections

26:05.250 --> 26:07.667
to a certain story from 1795.

26:07.875 --> 26:10.458
-(laughter)
-Hoists, block and tackles.

26:10.583 --> 26:12.625
We do know
he was in Nova Scotia.

26:12.792 --> 26:15.708
If there was an enterprise
conducted here on the part

26:15.833 --> 26:18.833
of Phips, there would be
many more objects to find.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.875
But we are not done with Lot 5.

26:22.042 --> 26:25.250
So it may yet prove to be
a very interesting find.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.042
Perhaps even significant.

26:27.208 --> 26:28.917
What's next, Carmen?

26:29.042 --> 26:31.000
Um, I think I'll go over
to this one here now.

26:31.167 --> 26:33.250
GARY: I'll give you
a little bit of context

26:33.375 --> 26:35.417
on that chunky piece of iron.

26:35.542 --> 26:38.542
Found on Lot 5
and when it first came up,

26:38.750 --> 26:42.750
I knew it was old
because it's nice and heavy.

26:42.875 --> 26:44.833
And it just had a feel like

26:45.000 --> 26:49.000
it was some kind of broken tool
to me or a fastener.

26:49.167 --> 26:51.083
It's very old.

26:51.250 --> 26:53.167
This is much older.

26:53.292 --> 26:55.667
Can we have a, uh, scan of that?

26:55.792 --> 26:58.625
-I need to see the head.
-The head? Yep.

26:59.833 --> 27:02.167
CARMEN: From what I see there,
on the head there,

27:02.375 --> 27:04.708
it looks like it's
a broken end off of something.

27:04.875 --> 27:06.875
-GARY: Yeah.
-JACK: It looks to me
like it could be

27:07.083 --> 27:09.125
-some sort of a chisel.
-Yes. This could be a, uh,

27:09.292 --> 27:12.125
tool that could be used
for mining or tunneling.

27:12.292 --> 27:15.833
Wow. And with the size that
you've got in your hand, mate,

27:16.000 --> 27:18.208
how much bigger
would it have been?

27:19.208 --> 27:21.250
CARMEN: Lengthwise, you'd
probably be looking at a foot.

27:21.375 --> 27:23.000
If it's shorter than that,

27:23.125 --> 27:25.542
again, it might not be
long enough to fulfill

27:25.708 --> 27:28.333
the purpose
of what you want it for.

27:28.458 --> 27:29.958
Could we see
the metallurgy, Emma?

27:30.042 --> 27:31.375
Sure thing.

27:32.750 --> 27:35.167
No modern elements.

27:35.333 --> 27:36.792
Potassium and calcium.

27:36.958 --> 27:39.583
So it's, it's an older metal.

27:39.750 --> 27:43.542
So we've got a lot
of old fasteners and tools,

27:43.708 --> 27:45.042
and more to come, mate.

27:45.208 --> 27:47.375
Yeah. I'll go
with this one here next.

27:51.292 --> 27:53.167
It looks like a bow tie strap.

27:53.333 --> 27:56.250
-You can see how...
Yeah, you can see the...
-You can see the bow tie.

27:56.375 --> 27:58.417
-What's a bow tie strap?
-CARMEN:
It was a decorative piece.

27:58.542 --> 27:59.917
It added decoration to it.

28:00.083 --> 28:02.500
It would be narrow,
wide, narrow, wide.

28:02.708 --> 28:04.708
All the way around
to decorate a chest.

28:04.875 --> 28:07.875
-Oh, so, specifically,
chest decorations?
-Yeah.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.792
-Wooden boxes and chest.
-Okay.

28:09.958 --> 28:11.750
RICK:
That's exceedingly interesting.

28:11.875 --> 28:14.000
Is there a cultural influence?

28:14.208 --> 28:15.750
Yes.

28:16.667 --> 28:19.167
-French.
-Really?

28:19.375 --> 28:20.292
-CARMEN: Yeah.
-Wow.

28:28.208 --> 28:31.000
NARRATOR:
A decorative strap from a chest?

28:31.208 --> 28:34.250
One that is not only
possibly of French origin,

28:34.375 --> 28:37.000
but may also
predate the 17th century?

28:37.167 --> 28:41.250
If so,
who brought it to Oak Island?

28:41.417 --> 28:45.000
We've found important
artifacts that have been French.

28:45.208 --> 28:47.250
We can't forget,
of course, the lead cross

28:47.375 --> 28:49.208
where the testing has
indicated that the lead came

28:49.375 --> 28:51.000
from the southern part of
France, so...

28:51.167 --> 28:52.875
Yeah. Doesn't get
any better than that.

28:53.042 --> 28:54.708
It's curious
that this stuff is found

28:54.875 --> 28:56.667
near an area on the Zena map

28:56.792 --> 28:59.000
that is a French map,

28:59.167 --> 29:01.833
that is a possible location
for a hatch.

29:03.375 --> 29:06.792
NARRATOR: In 2016,
the late author and researcher

29:06.917 --> 29:10.125
Zena Halpern
presented maps of Nova Scotia

29:10.292 --> 29:12.417
and Oak Island
featuring French writing,

29:12.542 --> 29:15.333
and what she believed
had been created between

29:15.500 --> 29:19.792
the 12th and 14th centuries by
members of the Knights Templar.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.542
This led Zena to theorize
that Oak Island

29:22.708 --> 29:24.250
had been visited numerous times

29:24.417 --> 29:26.167
by the Templars
and related organizations

29:26.375 --> 29:29.833
such as the Freemasons
in order to hide

29:30.000 --> 29:31.500
sacred valuables.

29:31.708 --> 29:33.583
Is it possible

29:33.750 --> 29:34.833
that the discoveries made

29:35.042 --> 29:36.917
by Rick, Marty and their team,

29:37.042 --> 29:40.833
such as the lead cross and
the numerous finds on Lot 5

29:40.958 --> 29:43.125
that predate the discovery
of the Money Pit,

29:43.333 --> 29:46.958
offer mounting evidence
that Zena's theory is true?

29:47.125 --> 29:50.792
RICK: We have long puzzled
about the possibility

29:50.958 --> 29:53.458
that these French items,
the lead cross

29:53.583 --> 29:55.708
and Zena's map were associated

29:55.875 --> 29:58.000
with some depositional work.

29:58.167 --> 30:01.208
I have always believed
that this work

30:01.375 --> 30:03.667
on Oak Island,
the original deposition work,

30:03.875 --> 30:06.125
was started incredibly early.

30:06.250 --> 30:09.208
We just have to fill in
the gaps more precisely,

30:09.375 --> 30:11.792
more accurately,
more definitively.

30:11.958 --> 30:14.292
But it's very interesting.

30:14.500 --> 30:17.292
CARMEN: The artifacts
you've shown me over the years,

30:17.500 --> 30:18.792
is very unique.

30:18.875 --> 30:20.500
There's artifacts
coming out of Oak Island

30:20.667 --> 30:22.083
that I haven't
seen anywhere else.

30:22.250 --> 30:25.417
That's the reason
for this type of analysis.

30:25.583 --> 30:28.292
What we are trying to do
is come to an understanding

30:28.458 --> 30:30.625
of what the item
represents in terms of the...

30:30.750 --> 30:32.542
complexity of the story
on Oak Island.

30:32.708 --> 30:34.667
It's not a simple process.

30:34.875 --> 30:36.667
GARY: Makes me want to
get back to Lot 5

30:36.833 --> 30:38.958
-and find some more.
-Well, let's have at her.

30:39.083 --> 30:40.708
That's why we have
a lot more to dig.

30:40.917 --> 30:42.167
We have a lot more to excavate.

30:42.333 --> 30:45.042
All I can say, Carmen,
is thank you.

30:45.208 --> 30:46.292
Appreciate it.

30:46.417 --> 30:47.833
CARMEN:
See you later.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.542
NARRATOR: As the team
concludes their meeting

30:49.750 --> 30:51.250
at the Interpretive Centre...

30:51.417 --> 30:53.708
STEVE: As long as this
borehole stays straight,

30:53.875 --> 30:56.000
-we should hit the tunnel below.
-CHARLES: Sounds good.

30:56.125 --> 30:58.083
NARRATOR: Surveyor
Steve Guptill, Oak Island

30:58.250 --> 31:00.500
historian Charles Barkhouse

31:00.667 --> 31:03.042
and geoscientist Dr. Ian Spooner

31:03.208 --> 31:05.667
continue monitoring
the drilling operation

31:05.875 --> 31:09.500
in borehole D.5N-25.5.

31:09.667 --> 31:10.708
He's got something else coming.

31:10.875 --> 31:12.292
NARRATOR:
A borehole

31:12.458 --> 31:15.208
located several feet
east of the Garden Shaft

31:15.375 --> 31:17.125
where they hope
to encounter a tunnel

31:17.292 --> 31:19.625
at a depth of some 105 feet

31:19.792 --> 31:23.042
and more evidence
of precious metals.

31:23.208 --> 31:25.208
STEVE:
The elevation of the wood
that we've been finding

31:25.375 --> 31:28.208
in this area, matches the wood
that we found for the tunnel

31:28.375 --> 31:30.333
that goes
under the Garden Shaft.

31:30.500 --> 31:32.333
All I'm saying is
I hope we hit wood again.

31:32.500 --> 31:34.833
-CHARLES: Yeah.
-STEVE: Got a core?

31:35.042 --> 31:37.500
-This is 98 feet.
-OTHERS: 98!

31:41.083 --> 31:43.208
CHARLES:
Let's hope it's a good one.

31:44.208 --> 31:46.417
IAN:
Thank you. Look at that.

31:46.583 --> 31:49.333
-It gets soft right here.
-STEVE: Oh, yeah,
you can feel it.

31:49.500 --> 31:51.417
-You can see it.
-IAN: Yeah. You can see it.

31:51.542 --> 31:53.917
You can take it and you can
just break it apart.

31:54.125 --> 31:55.667
Different color, too.

31:55.833 --> 31:57.917
What this means to me,

31:58.125 --> 31:59.792
when you get those
different colors,

32:00.000 --> 32:01.917
it's not standard gray till,

32:02.083 --> 32:03.750
it is possible
that you're in disturbed ground.

32:03.958 --> 32:06.500
To me it looks odd.

32:06.667 --> 32:07.833
-It does look odd.
-IAN: Yeah.

32:08.042 --> 32:09.167
CHARLES:
Core coming out.

32:09.333 --> 32:11.000
Let's go, guys.

32:11.125 --> 32:12.500
Looks like they got a full run.

32:12.708 --> 32:14.042
They've got a full run.

32:16.792 --> 32:18.000
What've you got?

32:18.208 --> 32:19.625
Uh, 104 and a half.

32:20.833 --> 32:22.875
STEVE:
This is just slush.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.083
This would be
the depth of the tunnel.

32:25.250 --> 32:26.917
So we might be inside of it.

32:30.708 --> 32:32.292
Seeing any wood?

32:34.375 --> 32:36.250
-We got a little bit.
-IAN: Are you sure?

32:36.417 --> 32:38.083
There's a little bit,
just a little bit of...

32:38.250 --> 32:40.792
wood debris at the bottom here.

32:40.958 --> 32:43.000
IAN:
Yeah. That-That's wood.

32:43.167 --> 32:45.917
-What we've got here is
a tunnel.
-Yep.

32:46.083 --> 32:48.458
I would say we are
probably inside the tunnel.

32:48.625 --> 32:50.042
-Right.
-Yep.

32:50.208 --> 32:52.167
CHARLES:
Very, very interesting.

32:56.375 --> 32:56.875
STEVE: Well, we've got
Craig and Scott coming.

32:57.250 --> 32:59.000
-Just in time.
-CRAIG: Gentlemen!

32:59.125 --> 33:00.542
-STEVE: Hey, guys. How ya doing?
-Good.

33:00.708 --> 33:03.167
You guys joined the party
at the right time.

33:03.333 --> 33:06.000
NARRATOR: It is an exciting
moment for the Oak Island

33:06.167 --> 33:07.833
team in the Money Pit area.

33:07.958 --> 33:09.083
IAN:
There's the wood. If you look

33:09.250 --> 33:11.333
around in there,
you can find little bits.

33:11.458 --> 33:13.500
NARRATOR:
Nearly 105 feet deep

33:13.625 --> 33:17.333
in borehole D.5N-25.5,

33:17.500 --> 33:20.292
they have once again
drilled into a possible tunnel.

33:20.458 --> 33:22.833
A tunnel that may lead
to the source

33:23.042 --> 33:24.500
of the precious metals,

33:24.708 --> 33:25.833
which have been detected

33:26.042 --> 33:27.333
at the same approximate depth

33:27.500 --> 33:31.083
within a 20-foot radius
of the Garden Shaft.

33:32.792 --> 33:34.083
STEVE:
I do think this is the tunnel

33:34.250 --> 33:36.125
that goes
under the Garden Shaft.

33:36.208 --> 33:39.167
-Everything lines up
too well not to be.
-Okay.

33:39.333 --> 33:41.292
Typically, we've been going
out the bottom of it at 106.

33:41.458 --> 33:43.792
-Yeah.
-So I think the next drill,

33:43.958 --> 33:45.333
if we hit wood,
we should have the bottom.

33:45.542 --> 33:46.583
CRAIG:
Potentially.

33:46.750 --> 33:48.250
We'll see,
we'll see what comes up.

33:49.250 --> 33:52.000
The way this tunnel
is positioned,

33:52.167 --> 33:55.333
it is sure pointing
towards the Garden Shaft.

33:55.500 --> 33:58.208
It's not one
of the searcher tunnels,

33:58.375 --> 34:01.583
so is it an original tunnel
leading the way to a vault?

34:01.750 --> 34:03.250
CHARLES:
We got a core coming!

34:03.417 --> 34:04.958
CRAIG: The water chemistry
is telling us

34:05.125 --> 34:07.292
it's a very important area,

34:07.375 --> 34:09.083
so we just need
to follow the tunnel.

34:09.250 --> 34:12.042
STEVE:
Here we go, fellas.

34:12.208 --> 34:14.000
What've you got, Mike?

34:14.125 --> 34:16.792
-111 and a half.
-111 and a half.

34:25.042 --> 34:27.083
SCOTT: There you go.
There's our wood.

34:27.250 --> 34:28.833
There's our tunnel.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.125
-Right there.
-MIKE: Oh, yeah!

34:32.333 --> 34:35.000
So let's get a measurement on
that then. See where we're at.

34:35.167 --> 34:37.042
107 to the wood.

34:37.208 --> 34:39.458
-STEVE: Roughly, that's
the zone of interest.
-Right.

34:39.583 --> 34:42.250
-So this is matching up well.
-Yeah.

34:42.417 --> 34:44.500
Well, we definitely
have the tunnel.

34:44.708 --> 34:48.250
I mean, this is a floorboard
or ceiling board that fell down.

34:48.417 --> 34:50.333
But it's, you know,
it's definitely wood.

34:50.458 --> 34:52.542
It's definitely
at the interval we want.

34:52.708 --> 34:54.000
Yep.

34:54.208 --> 34:55.667
RICK:
We've hit this tunnel

34:55.875 --> 34:57.542
in multiple locations.

34:57.750 --> 35:02.167
I think we now have a certainty
at the elevation of this tunnel.

35:02.250 --> 35:05.167
Right now,
we have suspicions of a target.

35:05.333 --> 35:07.500
We don't have
a really hard target.

35:07.708 --> 35:10.625
And thus the reason
to try to follow that line

35:10.792 --> 35:12.667
of tunnel detection holes

35:12.833 --> 35:17.042
to understand the direction
that the tunnel is taking.

35:17.208 --> 35:20.208
Because we are going
to extend the Garden Shaft.

35:20.375 --> 35:22.042
And then there's
the possibility that we could

35:22.250 --> 35:24.000
put in our own tunnel
and maybe it will

35:24.208 --> 35:26.167
help us find the treasure.

35:26.375 --> 35:28.750
What about drilling another well

35:28.917 --> 35:30.333
in this area?

35:30.500 --> 35:32.042
Yeah. I think
that's the best thing

35:32.208 --> 35:33.250
-to do at this point.
-Okay.

35:33.417 --> 35:34.375
CRAIG:
All right!

35:34.542 --> 35:36.500
MIKE:
That sounds good.

35:40.625 --> 35:42.500
NARRATOR:
The following morning...

35:42.708 --> 35:45.333
RICK: What are we
looking at and what

35:45.500 --> 35:48.083
have we done,
from a scientific perspective,

35:48.250 --> 35:50.333
to understand the importance

35:50.542 --> 35:53.125
-of these finds?
-...in the Interpretive Centre

35:53.292 --> 35:55.500
Rick Lagina meets
with archaeometallurgist

35:55.708 --> 35:59.292
Emma Culligan and other members
of the team to receive

35:59.458 --> 36:02.333
her analysis of two wood samples
that were collected

36:02.500 --> 36:06.042
from different boreholes
during the past two weeks.

36:06.208 --> 36:08.500
The first was obtained

36:08.708 --> 36:10.542
from borehole DN-12,

36:10.708 --> 36:13.333
which sets to the west
of the Garden Shaft

36:13.417 --> 36:16.250
in the Baby Blob
or possible treasure zone.

36:16.375 --> 36:19.375
While the second was taken
just several feet east

36:19.542 --> 36:21.333
of the Garden Shaft
in borehole

36:21.542 --> 36:24.833
D.5N-26.5.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.375
STEVE: So we've spent a lot
of this year in the Money Pit

36:27.542 --> 36:29.583
looking for the tunnel that goes
under the Garden Shaft.

36:29.708 --> 36:31.583
And we've been trying to find it
on the west side, which would be

36:31.750 --> 36:34.667
this piece and the east side,
which is this piece

36:34.875 --> 36:36.458
if it's the same tunnel.

36:36.583 --> 36:38.333
And to add to that, too,
I mean, we know last year

36:38.542 --> 36:40.042
whenever they were digging
in the Garden Shaft,

36:40.208 --> 36:41.375
they were taking some samples
on the way down

36:41.542 --> 36:42.875
and we saw some gold
in the wood.

36:43.042 --> 36:44.542
We may see something
like that in this.

36:44.708 --> 36:46.667
Something to indicate that we're
still close to that source.

36:46.833 --> 36:50.208
And right now,
we are sort of at a stop gate.

36:50.375 --> 36:53.042
We've drilled a lot on
the west side, in the Baby Blob.

36:53.208 --> 36:54.667
And we're running out
of room on the east side.

36:54.875 --> 36:56.667
So any piece of information
she can give us is gonna

36:56.875 --> 36:58.417
help move this forward.

37:00.250 --> 37:01.583
NARRATOR:
Using a device known

37:01.792 --> 37:03.708
as an X-ray fluorescence
spectrometer,

37:03.875 --> 37:06.333
Emma has conducted
elemental analysis

37:06.500 --> 37:08.875
on the two wood samples in order

37:09.000 --> 37:13.292
to determine if either contain
evidence of precious metals.

37:13.458 --> 37:17.208
Well, I think the next turn
of events is up to Emma.

37:17.375 --> 37:19.333
-Right, Emma, what did we learn?
-Yep.

37:19.542 --> 37:23.500
So you do see a lot of, uh,
the potassium and aluminum,

37:23.667 --> 37:25.750
which is what
we're used to seeing.

37:25.917 --> 37:28.333
-RICK: Mm-hmm.
-Um...

37:28.500 --> 37:31.333
Unfortunately,
no gold or silver or tin.

37:31.542 --> 37:35.375
But I am finding
points with palladium,

37:35.542 --> 37:37.375
which is something
that I was not

37:37.500 --> 37:39.500
expecting,
especially at that depth.

37:41.375 --> 37:45.083
.39, which is pretty high
for palladium.

37:45.250 --> 37:48.167
And the actual
geological association?

37:48.333 --> 37:51.083
I think Moya would be
a better judge of that.

37:51.208 --> 37:52.833
-Moya?
-Okay.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.958
Palladium can be found

37:55.083 --> 37:56.625
in gold and platinum deposits.

37:56.750 --> 38:00.375
So, if there is
the gold treasure,

38:00.542 --> 38:04.250
maybe the gold
in the treasure was sourced

38:04.417 --> 38:06.917
from a gold palladium deposit.

38:15.708 --> 38:17.125
NARRATOR: In the Interpretive
Centre, Rick Lagina

38:17.292 --> 38:19.833
and members of the team
have just learned

38:20.042 --> 38:23.167
that two wood samples
obtained from a believed

38:23.250 --> 38:27.542
tunnel located more than 90 feet
deep in the Money Pit area,

38:27.708 --> 38:31.500
and which may run
directly below the Garden Shaft

38:31.708 --> 38:34.333
contain high traces
of palladium,

38:34.500 --> 38:37.292
a precious metal
that could be related

38:37.458 --> 38:40.000
to the fabled
Oak Island treasure.

38:40.125 --> 38:41.417
Is that for both pieces of wood?

38:41.542 --> 38:44.333
Yeah, so there
is exhibit on both pieces.

38:44.500 --> 38:45.708
-Okay.
-EMMA: Yeah.

38:45.875 --> 38:47.042
Like, it's not
what I would be expecting.

38:47.250 --> 38:48.250
Right.

38:48.417 --> 38:50.083
MOYA:
So there isn't

38:50.292 --> 38:52.292
really a palladium deposit,

38:52.458 --> 38:54.250
like, here on this island,

38:54.417 --> 38:56.833
obviously, um,
but maybe there's, like, trace

38:57.042 --> 39:00.958
palladium within the treasure,
if there is treasure.

39:02.458 --> 39:04.875
NARRATOR:
First classified in 1803

39:05.042 --> 39:08.333
by the English chemist
William Hyde Wollaston,

39:08.500 --> 39:11.000
in modern times palladium

39:11.167 --> 39:12.833
is commonly used to produce

39:13.000 --> 39:14.708
hydro-carbon reducing devices

39:14.875 --> 39:17.583
such as catalytic converters
for automobiles.

39:17.750 --> 39:20.667
However,
it has often been associated

39:20.833 --> 39:23.792
with jewelry
made of gold, silver

39:23.917 --> 39:26.500
and platinum,
dating back to as early

39:26.708 --> 39:28.708
as the Ancient Egyptian era.

39:30.125 --> 39:33.625
It's not a common thing that you
find, especially around here.

39:33.708 --> 39:36.375
-That's even stranger then.
-Yeah.

39:36.542 --> 39:38.000
SCOTT: We should also
review the water data to see

39:38.167 --> 39:40.542
if there's any indication
of palladium in the water data.

39:40.708 --> 39:44.500
RICK: Palladium might be
associated with gold refining

39:44.708 --> 39:46.500
or gold being in the ground.

39:46.708 --> 39:48.833
That would be exceedingly
interesting to me.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.750
We have a piece
of wood at an elevation

39:50.917 --> 39:53.417
we have
significant interest in, so

39:53.583 --> 39:56.667
it's not just a piece of wood,
it's a clue.

39:56.833 --> 39:59.500
And this clue needs
to be followed.

39:59.708 --> 40:01.417
STEVE:
This is great information.

40:01.625 --> 40:03.833
We have a trace on both that
suggests it's the same tunnel.

40:04.000 --> 40:07.500
I think we need to get it dated,
so C-14 carbon dating.

40:07.667 --> 40:10.000
RICK: I mean, it's interesting
analysis, interesting breakdown.

40:10.208 --> 40:13.208
But let's retest and see what
happens and then go from there.

40:13.375 --> 40:14.667
We can learn something
from this,

40:14.833 --> 40:16.833
and it may be
highly instructive.

40:17.042 --> 40:20.667
Ultimately, data
like this will affect what

40:20.833 --> 40:23.000
decisions are made
regarding the Garden Shaft.

40:23.167 --> 40:25.208
Anyway, uh, thank you, Emma.

40:25.375 --> 40:27.667
-Thank you, yeah.
-As always, appreciate it.

40:27.875 --> 40:29.625
And I think the rest of us
need to go back out

40:29.833 --> 40:31.833
and to our specified work areas.

40:32.042 --> 40:33.333
Okay. Thanks, everybody.

40:33.500 --> 40:34.708
ALEX:
Yep.

40:34.875 --> 40:36.958
NARRATOR:
After another week

40:37.042 --> 40:39.792
of surprising discoveries
on Oak Island,

40:39.917 --> 40:43.083
Rick, Marty,
Craig and their team

40:43.208 --> 40:45.500
have good reason to believe
that they are close

40:45.708 --> 40:50.708
to the ultimate breakthrough
in a 228-year-old mystery.

40:51.792 --> 40:54.167
And while the evidence
that they have unearthed shows

40:54.375 --> 40:58.500
that the Money Pit is more
complex than anyone ever knew,

40:58.667 --> 41:01.542
the mounting clues suggest
that they are

41:01.708 --> 41:05.000
narrowing in on something
not only of great value,

41:05.208 --> 41:08.833
but, also,
incredible historic importance.

41:09.042 --> 41:13.333
But one looming question
still remains.

41:13.542 --> 41:16.167
Will a deadly curse,
that has claimed the lives

41:16.250 --> 41:18.417
of six men so far,

41:18.625 --> 41:21.583
stand in their way?

41:22.542 --> 41:25.333
Next time on
The Curse of Oak Island...

41:25.542 --> 41:29.500
That is an unusual find!

41:29.667 --> 41:31.625
But you see on the top right?

41:31.792 --> 41:33.167
-GARY: Yeah. Ooh, yeah.
-We get those crazy
Roman numerals

41:33.375 --> 41:35.625
and the U-shaped structure, too?

41:35.708 --> 41:37.792
TERRY: I got seven
and a half foot of tunnel.

41:37.917 --> 41:40.583
-Yeah, that's nice, eh?
-STEVE: You don't build a tunnel
like this,

41:40.708 --> 41:43.500
-unless you are moving
something important.
-Yep.

41:43.667 --> 41:45.375
We want to take
a look down in that cavity.

41:45.500 --> 41:47.417
There we go.

41:47.583 --> 41:50.833
SCOTT:
Slowly. Whoa!

41:50.958 --> 41:52.875
