00:04.922 --> 00:07.300
(Mulder) "At times I almost dream

00:10.469 --> 00:13.347
I too have spent a life the sages' way,

00:14.307 --> 00:16.684
and tread once more familiar paths.

00:19.478 --> 00:23.524
Perchance I perished
in an arrogant self-reliance an age ago;

00:24.275 --> 00:28.196
and in that act, a prayer
for one more chance went up so earnest,

00:28.279 --> 00:33.826
so instinct with better
light let in by death,

00:33.910 --> 00:37.079
that life was blotted
out, not so completely

00:39.290 --> 00:43.169
but scattered wrecks enough of it
to remain dim memories,

00:45.713 --> 00:47.006
as now,

00:48.299 --> 00:50.384
when seems once more

00:52.970 --> 00:55.431
the goal in sight again."

01:52.697 --> 01:54.991
(Man) Federal agents! We are armed!

01:55.825 --> 01:57.535
Let's go! Move, move, move!

01:58.953 --> 02:00.579
Keep down on the ground!

02:00.746 --> 02:04.166
We have warrants to search
for illegal firearms!

02:04.250 --> 02:07.920
We have warrants
for the arrest of Vernon Warren...

02:08.003 --> 02:10.131
Also known as Vernon ephesian.

02:10.214 --> 02:12.842
Move it, move it!
Come on, come on, let's go!

02:12.925 --> 02:14.093
Move, move, move!

02:16.053 --> 02:18.055
(Agents yelling)

02:21.559 --> 02:24.103
Someone tipped ephesian off.

02:24.186 --> 02:26.522
He's somewhere on the compound.

02:28.065 --> 02:31.277
- (Scully) Ephesian?
- No. We've covered 90% of the compound.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.988
- (Scully) We have to find him.
- No sign of weapons.

02:34.071 --> 02:37.366
- They've hid them somewhere.
- Where haven't we covered?

02:37.450 --> 02:41.537
We could check the machine shop again.
Maybe they've got trap doors.

02:47.835 --> 02:50.254
Mulder. Mulder!

02:50.629 --> 02:51.839
Tear it apart.

02:56.552 --> 02:59.805
Mulder? Mulder, where are you going?

03:01.932 --> 03:05.519
Intelligence reported
no hiding places beyond the yard.

03:19.617 --> 03:21.619
Did you see someone?

03:22.161 --> 03:25.164
(Woman's voice)
"I am he that iiveth, and was dead."

03:26.123 --> 03:27.583
"And, behold...

03:29.335 --> 03:31.462
I am alive for evermore."

03:42.973 --> 03:44.809
(Voice continues)

03:46.143 --> 03:48.187
(Woman praying)

03:51.315 --> 03:54.151
- (Woman continues praying)
- FBI!

03:58.781 --> 04:00.116
- _ no!
- (Gasps)

04:06.330 --> 04:08.541
It's ok. It's ok.

04:15.756 --> 04:18.175
(Man) Bureau of alcohol,
tobacco and firearms transmission

04:18.259 --> 04:20.803
received 0230 hours...

04:20.886 --> 04:24.056
5 November '96, apison, Tennessee.

04:24.515 --> 04:27.685
Confirmed telephone trace
from within seven stars compound.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.395
Ba tf. This is agent Kiley.

04:30.104 --> 04:34.525
(Man 2) Ok, I'm not gonna talk long.
I can't even believe I'm doing this.

04:34.608 --> 04:37.486
Ok, Vernon - he's got a lot of good ideas.

04:37.862 --> 04:40.322
He's right about a lot of things...

04:40.406 --> 04:43.200
But he's doin' stuff to kids now that...

04:43.284 --> 04:44.869
It ain't good.

04:45.286 --> 04:48.247
I'm telling you, it is not why I signed on.

04:48.539 --> 04:50.332
(Kiley) Ok, ok, easy.

04:50.541 --> 04:53.627
- Can you tell me your name, sir?
- Call me Sidney.

04:54.044 --> 04:58.132
Vernon - he's hurtin' little kids
around here bad. It ain't right.

04:58.424 --> 05:02.720
And the guns, my god, you could
beat the whole Korean army here.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.306
Oh, god, ican't talk no more. I got...

05:05.389 --> 05:06.724
(Dialling tone)

05:08.350 --> 05:11.270
This call capped off
a batf investigation...

05:11.353 --> 05:14.607
Of the temple of the seven stars
led by Vernon ephesian.

05:14.690 --> 05:18.277
That call convinced the Attorney General
to give the ok for our raid.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.446
Atf intelligence reports were weak.

05:20.529 --> 05:24.992
Our man, spooky, found ephesian
in a bunker atf didn't even know was there.

05:25.075 --> 05:27.661
- How did you know that?
- (Men arguing)

05:27.745 --> 05:28.913
Knock it off!

05:30.581 --> 05:34.418
The reports are valid. Illegal activities
were going on at that compound.

05:34.502 --> 05:36.837
They were alerted in time
to hide the evidence.

05:36.921 --> 05:41.550
Ephesian and his wives are held on charges
of possession of dangerous chemicals.

05:41.634 --> 05:44.595
Their attorneys will be
pushing for a quick arraignment.

05:44.845 --> 05:49.058
They'll be out of here in less than
24 hours if we cannot charge them.

05:51.018 --> 05:54.688
Agents on site will continue to search
for evidence of illegal firearms.

05:54.813 --> 05:58.150
And even more critical,
find the informant "Sidney".

05:58.567 --> 06:03.864
If they found out that he tipped us,
it's likely we're looking for a murderer.

06:05.407 --> 06:06.575
All right, go.

06:11.789 --> 06:13.874
Agent mulder, agent Scully...

06:15.543 --> 06:20.172
You were assigned to this operation to
investigate ephesian's paranormal abilities:

06:20.256 --> 06:21.840
Channelling, astral projection.

06:21.924 --> 06:27.429
He's a paranoid charismatic sociopath,
obsessed with the book of revelation.

06:27.513 --> 06:31.433
He will use his biblical knowledge to get
anything he wants from his followers.

06:31.517 --> 06:35.771
Ephesian had six women on the verge
of suicide. You witnessed it.

06:36.188 --> 06:38.482
If the temple members are released...

06:38.566 --> 06:41.986
Any federal investigation
will ignite ephesian's paranoia...

06:42.069 --> 06:45.906
To such a degree that we won't have
another waco on our hands.

06:46.323 --> 06:48.200
We'll have Jonestown.

06:51.954 --> 06:53.956
I knew you were coming.

06:55.666 --> 06:57.918
I've known for nine centuries.

06:59.461 --> 07:02.131
It was written
in the revelation of Jesus Christ.

07:03.674 --> 07:04.883
"Behold...

07:06.343 --> 07:10.514
The devil shall cast some of thee
into prison that you may be tried."

07:10.598 --> 07:14.018
"You'll have tribulation ten days."

07:14.101 --> 07:18.772
"Be thou faithful unto death,
and I'll give thee a crown of life."

07:18.856 --> 07:21.400
But that message
was to the church at smyrna.

07:21.483 --> 07:25.446
Your temple is the reincarnation
of the church at ephesia.

07:25.529 --> 07:28.574
Mine is the temple of the seven stars.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.828
All seven churches
receiving the revelation.

07:35.581 --> 07:40.419
And the members are not
a reincarnation of the church.

07:41.378 --> 07:42.463
Are you?

07:42.546 --> 07:45.591
Oh, yes. I was present
to hear apostle John Mark

07:45.674 --> 07:47.635
deliver his message of the apocalypse.

07:47.718 --> 07:52.431
Vernon, if Sidney was unfaithful,
did he receive a crown of life?

07:52.514 --> 07:55.517
There are no members of the temple
named Sidney.

07:55.851 --> 07:57.811
But I know you don't believe.

07:58.312 --> 08:02.900
I don't care if you think that
I'm Jim Jones or David koresh.

08:03.525 --> 08:06.487
I don't need you to
believe or even like me.

08:06.570 --> 08:10.908
Butjust for a moment, I'd like you
to put aside your investigation...

08:11.909 --> 08:13.744
For your own souls.

08:15.412 --> 08:19.333
It is vital that you understand
that very, very soon...

08:19.833 --> 08:23.337
All unfaithfuls, all
disbelievers, all beasts -

08:23.837 --> 08:25.881
if that means me or...

08:26.173 --> 08:27.966
This "Sidney"... or...

08:29.134 --> 08:30.427
You -

08:31.512 --> 08:34.515
all will be destroyed
by god's mighty men.

08:34.597 --> 08:37.893
It is what has been
told by god will happen.

08:39.520 --> 08:42.356
It is what has been told by god we must do.

08:43.774 --> 08:47.778
Do this, and the lord
shall preserve you from all evil.

08:49.571 --> 08:51.323
He will preserve your soul.

08:52.491 --> 08:55.077
The lord will preserve your going out...

08:56.912 --> 08:58.414
And your coming in.

09:00.916 --> 09:04.169
(Scully) Skinner said no one else
has come up with anything.

09:04.253 --> 09:07.047
They've started to release
members of the temple.

09:07.131 --> 09:10.426
The compound
remains under federal control, though.

09:12.136 --> 09:15.139
Time is flying.
We've got six wives to question.

09:15.556 --> 09:20.561
My estimate is 12 more hours of fire and
brimstone, and not a second about Sidney.

09:20.853 --> 09:22.146
Let's start with her.

09:28.110 --> 09:30.904
My name is Melissa riedel ephesian. I'm 25.

09:32.698 --> 09:34.801
Melissa, do you understand
your right to have an attorney

09:34.825 --> 09:36.869
present at this questioning?

09:38.203 --> 09:39.496
It's ok.

09:39.747 --> 09:41.457
Where are you from?

09:46.295 --> 09:47.463
I don't know.

09:47.713 --> 09:50.966
What about your family?
Where do they live?

09:51.300 --> 09:52.801
My real family's here.

09:52.885 --> 09:54.720
How long have you lived there?

09:56.930 --> 09:58.140
A year.

09:58.891 --> 10:01.560
How long have you been married
to ephesian?

10:02.853 --> 10:04.188
A year.

10:04.605 --> 10:06.648
Does it bother you he has other wives?

10:06.732 --> 10:10.694
"And on that day, seven women
shall take hold of one man, saying...

10:10.778 --> 10:14.823
We shall eat our own bread,
we shall wear our own apparel...

10:16.116 --> 10:19.912
Only let us be called by thy name
to take away our reproach."

10:20.370 --> 10:22.915
That's quite a faith you have in Vernon.

10:22.998 --> 10:27.544
I'd have a tough time if my husband
had so many children with other women.

10:29.713 --> 10:32.132
Do you have a child by Vernon?

10:33.926 --> 10:35.427
Someday.

10:37.888 --> 10:43.519
Vernon has to wait until god tells him when
the right soul is ready to be reincarnated.

10:43.602 --> 10:48.106
That's why Vernon's children are
the most sacred members of the temple.

10:48.190 --> 10:51.568
We were told
that Vernon's been hurting the children.

10:54.404 --> 10:58.367
Have you ever witnessed any child abuse
at the temple, Melissa?

11:04.915 --> 11:08.669
(Man's voice) I don't know
where you're gettin' that from.

11:08.752 --> 11:12.756
I saw a coupla things.
It could have been anything, right?

11:13.298 --> 11:14.424
Melissa?

11:14.508 --> 11:17.427
Melissa?
No. I don't know nobody called that.

11:17.511 --> 11:21.682
- Sidney?
- What is this? The McCarthy hearings?

11:21.765 --> 11:23.308
No, no... don't...

11:24.351 --> 11:26.436
Don't know anybody by that name. No.

11:26.520 --> 11:30.107
I saw a coupla things.
It could have been anything, right?

11:30.232 --> 11:34.027
Sidney, who is the president
of the United States right now?

11:34.111 --> 11:36.989
Who's the president of the United States?

11:37.072 --> 11:41.743
What kind of dumb question is that?
That is a stupid question. Harry Truman.

11:46.707 --> 11:50.127
Sidney is a past life
just because she mentioned Joe McCarthy?

11:50.210 --> 11:51.712
It's not just that.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.339
Somehow I just knew.

12:13.483 --> 12:14.693
(Door opens)

12:14.776 --> 12:17.112
Ephesian and his wives
get arraigned tomorrow.

12:17.195 --> 12:19.740
That's 15 hours to come up with something.

12:19.823 --> 12:22.743
"Come up with something"?
We found Sidney.

12:22.826 --> 12:26.330
Melissa riedel's vocal pattern
matches the atf Sidney call.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.206
Melissa riedel is not co-operating.

12:28.290 --> 12:31.418
But there is a personality within her
that wants to.

12:31.501 --> 12:34.796
We need a catalyst. I suggest
we take her back to the compound.

12:34.880 --> 12:39.051
Maybe without ephesian there,
it will enable Melissa to talk,

12:39.134 --> 12:41.219
or a personality inside her.

12:42.930 --> 12:45.682
Agent Scully,
could this be a staged diversion?

12:45.766 --> 12:49.770
- I thought multiple personalities were rare.
- They're extremely rare.

12:49.853 --> 12:54.358
In fact, many in the psychiatric community
do not believe they exist.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.819
What we witnessed meets the criteria
established in the dsmâ€”iv.

12:57.903 --> 13:00.364
Two or more distinct personality states

13:00.447 --> 13:02.258
that recurrently take control
over behaviour...

13:02.282 --> 13:04.618
Including the
protector identity, Sidney.

13:04.701 --> 13:08.789
The inability to recall personal information.
She couldn't recall her home town.

13:08.872 --> 13:12.000
Transitions are usually a matter of seconds

13:12.084 --> 13:14.086
and are often caused
by psychosocial stress.

13:14.169 --> 13:17.631
Sidney appeared when we mentioned
that children had been abused.

13:17.714 --> 13:21.218
- But you remain unconvinced?
- I believe the disorder exists...

13:21.301 --> 13:23.845
But I would have to know more.

13:23.929 --> 13:29.601
If Melissa has multiple personalities, would
her... his testimony even be admissible?

13:29.685 --> 13:33.438
Precedents have established that
dissociative personalities are responsible.

13:33.522 --> 13:35.816
But we are responsible for Melissa riedel.

13:35.899 --> 13:39.653
We are responsible for
the potential loss of 50 lives.

13:42.739 --> 13:44.241
Do it.

13:46.952 --> 13:49.913
You didn't tell Skinner
what you really believe.

13:49.997 --> 13:54.001
That Melissa riedel is being invaded
by her past-life incarnations.

13:54.084 --> 13:58.755
- He wouldn't believe me.
- You don't feel responsible for the 50 lives...

13:58.839 --> 14:00.716
Or Melissa riedel.

14:01.299 --> 14:04.302
You are only responsible
to yourself, mulder.

14:10.684 --> 14:13.228
(Mulder) You're safe with us, Melissa.

14:14.021 --> 14:15.731
The murderer's not here.

14:15.814 --> 14:19.484
(Scully) We know that events occurred here
that may be painful.

14:20.277 --> 14:24.906
You may not wanna talk about them,
you may be afraid to remember.

14:27.034 --> 14:32.706
But to help the others, to help
the children and to help yourself...

14:33.457 --> 14:37.753
We're here with you to listen...
To Melissa, to Sidney...

14:37.836 --> 14:40.172
To whoever may need to talk.

16:04.923 --> 16:06.299
Melissa?

16:11.763 --> 16:13.098
Melissa?

16:13.640 --> 16:15.517
Why you calling me that?

16:15.600 --> 16:18.687
- What should I call you?
- Lily.

16:20.605 --> 16:25.110
Lily... were any of your friends
hurt in this room?

16:32.075 --> 16:33.243
What?

16:33.994 --> 16:35.662
Can you do this?

16:35.871 --> 16:37.789
Melissa... Lily...

16:40.333 --> 16:42.294
It's ok to tell me.

16:49.885 --> 16:52.888
(Sidney) Look, leave
the kid alone. Hear me?

16:53.638 --> 16:56.141
She doesn't wanna talk. Right? No way.

16:56.224 --> 16:57.434
I'm sending her home.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.854
Sidney, you can all go home.
You can all be safe...

17:00.937 --> 17:03.523
If you tell us where they hid the guns.

18:04.292 --> 18:06.294
What's wrong?

18:30.402 --> 18:34.948
(Southern accent) The weapons were placed
in the bunker they'd built the night before.

18:35.031 --> 18:37.492
That's why they weren't on the atf reports.

18:37.575 --> 18:41.871
The federals would arrive in the morning,
just before the sun.

18:42.747 --> 18:46.042
Realising the government's
might and number...

18:46.126 --> 18:49.212
Most believed they, indeed,
would never again...

18:49.296 --> 18:51.423
See the light of day...

18:51.506 --> 18:56.428
Just as they had watched their brothers
die days before on missionary Ridge.

18:56.511 --> 19:00.390
We had received word of general cleburne's
retreat from the union army.

19:00.473 --> 19:05.437
As a nurse, I had been ordered from
Hamilton county to meet the troops, but...

19:06.771 --> 19:09.691
In actuality, I was searching for him...

19:10.275 --> 19:13.278
Knowing that he would attempt
to remain in Tennessee...

19:13.361 --> 19:15.697
Rather than retreat to Dalton.

19:16.740 --> 19:19.200
I found him here...

19:19.284 --> 19:21.911
Amongst the others who had been lost...

19:21.995 --> 19:25.498
As general Thomas pushed through
the confederate line.

19:29.961 --> 19:33.256
The federal troops would appear
from that direction.

19:33.840 --> 19:37.552
Rather than retreat any further,
they fought them...

19:37.886 --> 19:40.013
Hidin' us in the bunker.

19:41.473 --> 19:43.308
Inside, I could...

19:43.391 --> 19:44.976
Smell the smoke...

19:45.894 --> 19:47.896
Hear the rifles...

19:49.397 --> 19:53.109
Feel the bodies as they dropped
onto the ground above.

19:56.905 --> 19:59.157
Every last one.

20:03.161 --> 20:04.871
26th November...

20:06.373 --> 20:08.375
1863.

20:16.883 --> 20:18.635
I was here...

20:20.845 --> 20:22.472
As were you.

20:31.856 --> 20:34.484
This is the field where I watched you die.

20:54.170 --> 20:55.672
(Scully) Who are you calling?

20:55.797 --> 20:59.092
I want a therapist trained in hypnosis
to be at the command centre.

20:59.175 --> 21:02.345
Because hypnosis is used
to treat dissociative identities...

21:02.429 --> 21:05.682
To bring forth a patient's
various personalities?

21:05.807 --> 21:08.935
She wants to talk, Scully.
It's a matter of getting it out of her.

21:09.018 --> 21:11.855
No, it's about regressing
her to a past life.

21:11.980 --> 21:16.860
Don't do this to her, mulder. This poor
woman's mind, her life is in shreds.

21:17.527 --> 21:21.698
Just being married to ephesian indicates
she is susceptible to suggestion.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.867
You were there, Scully!

21:24.451 --> 21:28.163
You saw it. You heard it.
Why can't you feel it?

21:29.873 --> 21:32.709
How could I know about a bunker
in a field I've never been in?

21:32.792 --> 21:37.046
And why is it that Vernon ephesian is
reported by you a paranoid sociopath...

21:37.130 --> 21:39.632
Because he believes
he lived 100 years ago...

21:39.716 --> 21:43.970
And you're not, even though you believe
you died in that field?

21:49.893 --> 21:52.228
(Therapist) I'm talking to Melissa.

21:53.021 --> 21:55.815
In the last year,
at the temple of the seven stars...

21:55.899 --> 22:00.528
Is there anything that happened that
you thought was wrong, that hurt you?

22:01.029 --> 22:02.030
Yes.

22:08.369 --> 22:10.371
There was a...

22:13.208 --> 22:15.502
Woman who came to the temple.

22:18.004 --> 22:20.757
She and her son
had been living on the streets.

22:20.924 --> 22:22.258
What was her name?

22:23.051 --> 22:24.385
Elizabeth.

22:25.261 --> 22:26.930
Her son was Scott.

22:28.598 --> 22:30.934
Vernon took a liking to the boy.

22:31.059 --> 22:33.937
He said that he was a prophet returning.

22:36.523 --> 22:38.942
He took the boy away from his mother.

22:39.192 --> 22:41.194
Took him away? How?

22:42.445 --> 22:47.283
Vernon's children are the grandchildren
of god, kept separate from the others.

22:48.910 --> 22:50.954
The mother's heart was broken.

22:51.454 --> 22:52.956
She was afraid.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.458
The mighty men...

22:58.211 --> 23:00.380
Late... night...

23:02.799 --> 23:04.634
Liz sneaks in to see Scott.

23:05.385 --> 23:06.928
Oh, he was happy.

23:08.304 --> 23:11.975
She brings him a butterfinger
she stole from the kitchen.

23:15.562 --> 23:17.730
Vernon... Vernon...

23:17.814 --> 23:19.649
Vernon catches them.

23:21.818 --> 23:23.611
The mighty men...

23:24.946 --> 23:28.074
They pull her away, and beat her...

23:28.950 --> 23:30.743
In front of her son.

23:30.827 --> 23:33.246
The boy... "No, no, mom!"

23:33.329 --> 23:34.664
(Crying)

23:37.792 --> 23:39.586
Vernon... Vernon...

23:40.169 --> 23:41.838
Vernon pulls him by...

23:42.338 --> 23:45.008
Vernon pulls him by his hair...

23:46.676 --> 23:49.846
Pulls down his pyjamas, and hit him.

23:52.348 --> 23:54.601
"You're not a child of god."

23:55.643 --> 23:57.937
"Garbage", he calls him.

23:58.813 --> 24:00.940
He told him to sleep in the trash...

24:01.524 --> 24:02.984
With the rats.

24:05.153 --> 24:08.031
The mother... the mother cries...

24:09.115 --> 24:11.701
But Vernon beats him...

24:12.493 --> 24:13.536
In front of her.

24:13.661 --> 24:16.539
(Whimpering) Oh! Oh! No, no, no!

24:17.624 --> 24:21.002
(Sidney) Lookit!
Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant move!

24:21.502 --> 24:24.297
What do you wanna know? Just... just...

24:25.298 --> 24:29.552
Leave Melissa alone. She doesn't need to
go through that any more.

24:30.887 --> 24:34.223
- Where are the guns?
- The b-bunkers. Yeah.

24:35.016 --> 24:40.521
The civil war bunkers. Vernon... Vernon...
Vernon and his goons know, but I don't.

24:40.897 --> 24:44.484
Maybe there's a map
of the battlefield in the records.

24:44.734 --> 24:46.736
You know how to find the other bunkers.

24:46.861 --> 24:47.987
Mulder...

24:50.073 --> 24:51.574
Melissa.

24:54.744 --> 24:56.079
It's me, Melissa.

24:59.248 --> 25:01.334
I want you to go back...

25:03.419 --> 25:04.712
Back to the field.

25:16.391 --> 25:17.475
(Sobs)

25:23.856 --> 25:24.941
Oh!

25:29.612 --> 25:33.032
(Southern accent)
Your eyes may have changed shade...

25:34.117 --> 25:37.537
But it cannot colour
the soul behind them.

25:38.955 --> 25:42.208
We have come together
in this life, this time...

25:42.792 --> 25:44.961
Only to meet in passing.

25:49.799 --> 25:53.052
It is so heartbreaking to wait.

25:57.265 --> 25:59.100
I miss you.

26:14.907 --> 26:17.660
Mulder, this is a product of her illness.

26:17.785 --> 26:22.248
She couldn't answer the question on the
battlefield. She gave us no specific names...

26:22.331 --> 26:24.917
No information to prove her validity.

26:25.001 --> 26:28.254
There is nothing we can use
to prove this is the truth.

26:28.337 --> 26:29.589
There's one way.

26:29.672 --> 26:34.010
Ephesian's arraignment is in two hours.
There is no time to be doing this.

26:34.302 --> 26:36.512
Wouldn't you, Scully?

26:38.973 --> 26:40.975
Wouldn't anybody?

26:42.435 --> 26:47.190
(Therapist) I want you to go into your
past, beyond your life as fox mulder.

26:51.986 --> 26:53.362
What do you see?

27:01.788 --> 27:03.956
Ghetto streets.

27:06.542 --> 27:08.711
Shattered glass.

27:11.380 --> 27:13.549
Bodies of the dead.

27:16.636 --> 27:18.638
I'm a woman...

27:20.973 --> 27:23.226
A Jewish woman.

27:23.351 --> 27:24.685
Poland.

27:28.356 --> 27:30.566
My son is with me.

27:34.070 --> 27:37.323
- He is Samantha.
- (Therapist) Samantha?

27:38.032 --> 27:40.743
I thought Samantha was your sister.

27:40.910 --> 27:43.079
In this life...

27:43.246 --> 27:45.414
She is my son.

27:51.212 --> 27:53.381
I see my father.

27:59.011 --> 28:01.264
He's dead in the street.

28:07.770 --> 28:09.939
He is Scully.

28:10.857 --> 28:14.026
But now... he's gone on now.

28:15.695 --> 28:17.405
They're waiting for us.

28:18.698 --> 28:20.199
Souls...

28:21.284 --> 28:23.411
Come back together.

28:24.787 --> 28:26.789
Different...

28:28.291 --> 28:30.793
But always together...

28:31.460 --> 28:33.462
Again and again...

28:34.463 --> 28:36.215
To learn.

28:36.299 --> 28:39.135
I can't go to my father.

28:47.268 --> 28:48.603
(Sighs)

28:49.270 --> 28:51.981
Gestapo is standing next to him.

28:56.569 --> 28:58.571
An officer.

29:02.158 --> 29:04.160
He is cancer man.

29:05.077 --> 29:07.246
Evil returns as evil.

29:09.665 --> 29:11.792
But love...

29:12.251 --> 29:14.253
Love...

29:14.337 --> 29:17.590
Souls mate... eternal.

29:21.844 --> 29:24.430
My... husband...

29:24.972 --> 29:27.350
Is taken away from me...

29:28.684 --> 29:30.811
To the camps.

29:31.854 --> 29:33.856
He is Melissa.

29:35.149 --> 29:37.860
We're always taken away.

29:42.448 --> 29:44.533
I'm rising.

29:45.534 --> 29:47.828
I'm rising now.

29:52.833 --> 29:54.835
I'm rising now...

29:55.711 --> 29:57.880
High above...

29:58.214 --> 30:00.341
My body...

30:02.343 --> 30:04.512
Above the field.

30:05.054 --> 30:07.223
My face is bloody.

30:09.558 --> 30:11.727
Near the bunker.

30:14.355 --> 30:16.565
The federals are gone.

30:19.568 --> 30:21.862
My sergeant is also dead.

30:25.700 --> 30:26.993
He is Scully.

30:31.247 --> 30:33.499
Sarah holds me.

30:37.670 --> 30:39.672
She is sad.

30:44.260 --> 30:46.262
She is Melissa.

30:49.056 --> 30:51.058
She lives...

30:52.059 --> 30:54.228
Near the battle.

30:55.771 --> 30:57.773
Hamilton county.

30:58.107 --> 31:00.401
Her name is kavanaugh...

31:01.444 --> 31:03.237
Sarah kavanaugh.

31:04.447 --> 31:06.574
And my name...

31:07.116 --> 31:09.285
Is Sullivan biddle.

31:15.583 --> 31:17.793
She doesn't know.

31:19.587 --> 31:21.756
She doesn't know...

31:24.717 --> 31:27.219
That I'm waiting for her...

31:33.809 --> 31:36.145
That we will live again.

31:38.981 --> 31:41.233
We will live again.

31:47.740 --> 31:49.492
Oh, my soul is tired.

31:49.575 --> 31:51.660
Mulder, it's Scully.

31:52.328 --> 31:54.789
Do you see any bunkers in the field?

31:55.247 --> 31:57.500
My soul is tired.

32:03.005 --> 32:04.673
I wanna rest.

33:50.571 --> 33:54.116
(Scully) Ephesian's being taken down
to his arraignment.

33:54.408 --> 33:57.161
He and Melissa
are going to be released soon.

33:57.661 --> 34:00.039
Dana... if, um...

34:02.583 --> 34:06.003
Early in the four years
we've been working together...

34:07.504 --> 34:11.425
An event occurred that suggested
or somebody told you that...

34:12.342 --> 34:14.762
We'd been friends together...

34:14.844 --> 34:17.848
In other lifetimes... always...

34:19.433 --> 34:23.478
Would it have changed some of the ways
we looked at one another?

34:23.562 --> 34:25.898
Even if! Knew for certain...

34:26.857 --> 34:29.068
I wouldn't change a day.

34:35.366 --> 34:37.909
Well, maybe that "flukeman" thing.

34:38.159 --> 34:40.996
I could have lived without that just fine.

34:44.541 --> 34:48.212
(Sarah) We have come together
in this life, this time...

34:48.462 --> 34:50.047
Only to meet in passing.

34:52.925 --> 34:55.928
It is so heartbreaking to wait.

34:56.844 --> 34:58.222
(Sarah sighing)

35:00.182 --> 35:01.850
I miss you.

35:06.563 --> 35:09.733
- I don't believe in it.
- Why?

35:10.317 --> 35:14.488
Those tapes are saying we chose
the lives we live before we're born...

35:14.571 --> 35:16.490
And who we live with.

35:18.784 --> 35:20.911
It's a nice idea.

35:22.371 --> 35:24.665
It's a beautiful idea.

35:27.835 --> 35:29.253
I wanna believe.

35:32.715 --> 35:36.427
And if I knew it were true,
I'd want to start over.

35:38.929 --> 35:41.515
I'd want to end this pointless life.

35:41.598 --> 35:43.392
Sarah...

35:43.976 --> 35:46.061
If it were true...

35:46.729 --> 35:48.689
No life would be pointless.

36:01.243 --> 36:02.578
(Door opens)

36:03.579 --> 36:04.621
Melissa...

36:05.914 --> 36:07.374
It's time to leave.

36:34.943 --> 36:39.114
I've reported to investigators
the possible existence of other bunkers.

36:39.490 --> 36:44.787
The field is not the property of the seven
stars, so the ba tf is continuing to search.

36:45.412 --> 36:47.164
(Girl) Mommy! They're home!

37:07.226 --> 37:09.311
The Attorney General is furious as is.

37:09.395 --> 37:11.897
We won't get a go-ahead
for a second move on the compound.

37:11.980 --> 37:16.360
Ephesian's followers believe that the FBI
and the atf are the devil's army...

37:16.485 --> 37:19.571
Prophesied in revelations 12:17
to make war on the seed...

37:19.655 --> 37:22.866
Keeping god's commandments
and the testimony of Jesus Christ.

37:22.991 --> 37:25.744
Revelations says Christian faith
defeats that army.

37:25.828 --> 37:30.624
You're saying he'll attack the atf agents,
believing, as prophesied, he'll win?

37:30.707 --> 37:35.212
I would be saying that if I thought
he believed in revelations in its entirety.

37:35.337 --> 37:38.090
- But he hid the weapons.
- He knew he couldn't defeat us.

37:38.173 --> 37:40.467
If he doesn't believe
he can defeat that army...

37:40.551 --> 37:46.014
He may think by denying himself and his
followers to the devil... you understand?

37:46.098 --> 37:49.268
He will achieve for them
the reward of life for evermore.

37:49.351 --> 37:51.186
Our worst fears will be realised.

37:52.521 --> 37:53.939
All members to worship.

37:54.022 --> 37:58.861
The lord shall preserve you from all
your evils. He shall preserve your soul.

37:59.445 --> 38:03.991
All members to worship. The lord
shall preserve you from all your evil.

38:04.074 --> 38:06.910
He shall preserve your soul.

38:09.538 --> 38:13.417
"Marvel not, my brethren,
that the world hates you."

38:17.129 --> 38:22.718
"We know we've passed from death into life
because we love the brethren."

38:23.093 --> 38:26.263
I will not remove our people.
We're close to finding the weapons.

38:26.388 --> 38:29.224
All I want is a cooling-off period.

38:29.308 --> 38:31.894
Ephesian's gathered all members
in the worship hall.

38:31.977 --> 38:35.189
A parabolic Mike we have aimed
at the compound just picked this up.

38:35.272 --> 38:39.067
(Ephesian) "Marvel not, my brethren,
that the world hates you."

38:39.151 --> 38:40.486
(Door latched)

38:40.986 --> 38:46.617
"We know we've passed from death into life
because we love the brethren."

38:47.075 --> 38:52.080
"Hereby perceive we the love of god
because he laid down his life for us."

38:54.416 --> 38:57.461
The temple began running
an interference frequency.

38:57.586 --> 38:59.171
First epistle of John:

38:59.254 --> 39:04.259
"He laid down his life for us, and we ought
to lay down our lives for the brethren."

39:05.177 --> 39:06.303
Ok, mulder.

39:10.599 --> 39:14.186
(Ephesian) "Blessed are they
that do his commandments...

39:14.937 --> 39:18.440
That they may have the right
to the tree of life."

39:19.942 --> 39:21.610
My little children...

39:22.110 --> 39:26.156
Let us not love in
word, neither in tongue...

39:26.615 --> 39:28.951
But in deed and truth.

39:30.202 --> 39:32.788
And hereby, we know that we are the truth.

39:34.998 --> 39:36.542
We shall endure.

39:38.961 --> 39:40.546
(Agent) Man down! Man down!

39:42.714 --> 39:45.008
- Get him out of there!
- Cease fire!

39:45.300 --> 39:47.219
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

39:50.389 --> 39:53.850
- Is there contact with the temple?
- If you call that "contact".

39:53.976 --> 39:56.228
He should be transported right away.

39:58.480 --> 40:01.525
"And enter in through the gates
into the city!"

40:01.817 --> 40:04.695
"For without are dogs...

40:06.154 --> 40:07.864
And sorcerers...

40:08.657 --> 40:10.367
And whoremongers...

40:11.201 --> 40:14.913
And murderers, idolaters."

40:21.003 --> 40:22.838
"Whomsoever...

40:24.548 --> 40:27.593
Loveth and maketh a lie."

40:38.895 --> 40:40.188
(Scully) Mulder, no!

40:41.398 --> 40:43.567
You're dead!

41:35.911 --> 41:37.412
(Sobs)

41:38.747 --> 41:40.290
"Behold...

41:40.957 --> 41:43.335
I am alive for evermore."

43:15.010 --> 43:17.262
(Mulder) "At times I almost dream

43:19.681 --> 43:22.267
I too have spent a life the sages' way,

43:23.018 --> 43:25.395
and tread once more familiar paths.

43:27.272 --> 43:31.443
Perchance I perished
in an arrogant self-reliance an age ago;

43:32.110 --> 43:36.281
and in that act, a prayer
for one more chance went up so earnest,

43:36.364 --> 43:41.828
so instinct with better
light let in by death,

43:41.912 --> 43:45.040
that life was blotted out not so completely

43:46.750 --> 43:50.712
but scattered wrecks,
enough of it to remain dim memories,

43:52.214 --> 43:53.548
as now,

43:54.216 --> 43:56.301
when seems once more

43:58.094 --> 44:00.555
the goal in sight again."

(Child) I made this!
