WEBVTT

00:02.773 --> 00:04.539
- Morning, Arthur.
- Hey, Randy.

00:04.619 --> 00:05.715
How's your new partner?

00:05.740 --> 00:08.077
Uh, typical eager-beaver rookie.

00:08.079 --> 00:09.778
Can't wait to clean up the streets

00:09.780 --> 00:11.213
and protect and serve.

00:11.215 --> 00:12.881
Ah, it's such a cute age.

00:12.883 --> 00:14.216
Aw...

00:14.218 --> 00:17.019
Can I tempt you with a batch
of some fresh maple crèmes?

00:17.021 --> 00:18.253
- Hmm?
- Ooh!

00:18.584 --> 00:20.254
Okay, all right.

00:20.279 --> 00:22.209
I had to chase him four
blocks, but I got him.

00:22.279 --> 00:24.426
All right, I'm calling the station.

00:24.428 --> 00:26.528
Dispatch, this is Officer DeLuca.

00:26.530 --> 00:29.224
Be advised... the
maple crèmes are fresh.

00:30.834 --> 00:33.302
This is what you're doing while
I'm out there risking my life?

00:33.304 --> 00:34.336
Oh, James.

00:34.338 --> 00:35.571
Some day you're gonna learn

00:35.573 --> 00:36.905
the difference between the perps

00:36.907 --> 00:40.175
that need chasing and the
ones that are just "eh."

00:40.626 --> 00:42.411
Really? I hold up a liquor store,

00:42.413 --> 00:43.718
and all I get is "eh"?

00:43.773 --> 00:45.023
And there's your confession.

00:47.118 --> 00:49.001
Now just relax, order
yourself something.

00:49.026 --> 00:51.735
Okay. Uh, do you have any cronuts?

00:51.760 --> 00:53.088
- Ooh!
- Oh!

00:53.090 --> 00:55.057
What?

00:55.230 --> 00:56.225
A cronut.

00:56.227 --> 00:58.260
It's, uh, part donut, part croissant.

00:58.262 --> 00:59.387
It's what they call a hybrid.

00:59.458 --> 01:01.841
I-I know what a cronuts is,
and no, I don't sell them.

01:01.880 --> 01:04.519
Nor do I sell muffins
or duffins or muffnuts.

01:05.927 --> 01:06.835
The name of this place is

01:06.837 --> 01:08.804
Superior Donuts. I sell donuts.

01:08.806 --> 01:11.206
My parents did not smuggle
me out of Communist Poland

01:11.208 --> 01:12.941
in the hold of a cargo ship

01:12.943 --> 01:15.659
so that 65 years later, I
could sell you a damn cronut!

01:18.605 --> 01:19.308
Scone?

01:19.333 --> 01:20.716
Get out of here.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:30.684 --> 01:32.401
- Hi, Arthur.
- Hey, Maya.

01:32.426 --> 01:33.723
Whoa! Lot of books.

01:33.748 --> 01:35.253
Yeah. I'm changing my dissertation

01:35.255 --> 01:36.822
to a textual analysis

01:36.884 --> 01:38.117
of hetero-normative structures

01:38.142 --> 01:40.455
as they relate to the
postmodern patriarchy.

01:40.517 --> 01:41.938
Now, I know what you're thinking...

01:41.963 --> 01:43.735
How ironic to be writing
about gender roles

01:43.760 --> 01:45.877
surrounded by donuts,
which... Let's face it...

01:45.909 --> 01:48.734
Are Western culture's culinary
representation of the vagina.

01:50.631 --> 01:52.204
So what kind of vagina can I get you?

01:53.890 --> 01:55.857
Arthur, it is only okay when I say it.

01:55.882 --> 01:56.952
Oh.

01:58.435 --> 01:59.146
Donut man!

01:59.216 --> 02:00.784
- I'm here about the job.
- What?

02:00.809 --> 02:02.432
"You got a Help Wanted"
sign in the window,

02:02.457 --> 02:04.356
which you don't need
anymore, 'cause I'm here.

02:04.692 --> 02:06.437
Okay. Leave your résumé.
I'll call if I'm interested.

02:06.462 --> 02:08.015
Mm, I ain't really a résumé guy.

02:08.041 --> 02:09.741
But I'll tell you this. I
used to work at Pete's Liquors,

02:09.743 --> 02:11.376
till they turned that
into a Whole Foods.

02:11.378 --> 02:13.144
And I used to drive a
truck for the Salvation Army

02:13.146 --> 02:14.507
till they turned that into an Old Navy.

02:16.116 --> 02:18.183
So you're a small business
serial killer, huh?

02:18.185 --> 02:20.585
You funny. So what's the pay?

02:20.587 --> 02:22.287
- Minimum wage.
- Health insurance?

02:22.289 --> 02:24.256
First aid kit.

02:24.258 --> 02:25.924
- What about profit sharing?
- Profit sharing?

02:25.926 --> 02:27.205
Do you believe in profit sharing?

02:27.260 --> 02:28.549
Yeah, I believe in it. I don't offer it.

02:30.097 --> 02:31.830
You want benefits, why don't
you apply at the Whole Foods?

02:31.855 --> 02:34.465
Ugh. I refuse to work for
some greedy-ass corporation

02:34.490 --> 02:36.801
that's ripping the soul out of
the neighborhood I grew up in.

02:36.803 --> 02:37.402
They turned you down?

02:37.404 --> 02:38.154
Bastards!

02:39.935 --> 02:40.839
So what would I have to do?

02:40.841 --> 02:43.675
Uh, work the counter,
brew coffee, make change.

02:43.677 --> 02:44.776
You need help with social media?

02:44.778 --> 02:46.645
Instagram? Snapchat?

02:46.647 --> 02:48.967
Tumblr? Morse code? Cave paintings?

02:48.992 --> 02:50.025
How old are you, man?

02:51.189 --> 02:52.937
I don't need that stuff.
This is a donut shop.

02:53.015 --> 02:54.992
I hate to break it you,
but this is a donut museum.

02:56.523 --> 02:58.089
It happens to be my slow time of day.

02:58.091 --> 03:00.892
It's 8:00 a.m. in a place
that serves breakfast.

03:01.516 --> 03:02.994
In a city full of fat people.

03:04.555 --> 03:05.945
You got, like, one customer here, man!

03:05.970 --> 03:07.032
You have a point?

03:07.034 --> 03:09.167
This place could be
a gold mine, you know?

03:09.169 --> 03:11.002
It's authentic. People love that.

03:11.004 --> 03:12.471
Just remind the world that you're here.

03:12.596 --> 03:15.572
"Maybe put a chalkboard outside
with a Donut of the Day" on it.

03:15.597 --> 03:16.751
You know, eventually, the chalkboard's

03:16.776 --> 03:18.126
gonna get stolen, but that's fine.

03:18.204 --> 03:19.678
That's cool. It gets the people talking.

03:19.680 --> 03:21.179
Yo, yo, you heard somebody stole

03:21.181 --> 03:22.239
"the chalkboard from the donut shop?"

03:22.271 --> 03:24.442
"Wait, wait. Back up. We got
a donut shop? I want a donut!"

03:24.467 --> 03:26.489
Now everybody talk about donuts, man!

03:27.957 --> 03:28.753
Bam!

03:28.799 --> 03:30.432
You realize this is a
job interview, right?

03:30.457 --> 03:31.589
Yeah. How am I doing?

03:31.591 --> 03:32.940
Actually, not bad.

03:35.362 --> 03:37.871
Arthur, I'm celebrating!
Donuts for everyone!

03:38.113 --> 03:39.847
Who was already in the
room when I made the offer.

03:41.401 --> 03:43.151
Fawz, why are you in such a good mood?

03:43.176 --> 03:45.440
The American dream, my
friend. I'm living it!

03:45.465 --> 03:47.939
For years, I'm buying buildings
in this dung-heap neighborhood.

03:47.941 --> 03:49.574
And now Starbucks is opening.

03:49.576 --> 03:51.240
Rents will rise, and I will be rich!

03:51.295 --> 03:53.271
I'm gonna have money coming into my ass!

03:54.428 --> 03:57.482
Great. Jack up the rent so I
got to move down to South Side

03:57.484 --> 03:59.446
and dodge bullets every
time I go to the store.

04:00.485 --> 04:01.501
Who is this black guy?

04:03.251 --> 04:04.553
Actually, I go by Franco.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.076
"Only my friends call me black guy."

04:07.568 --> 04:08.994
What? I'm not allowed
to say you're black?

04:08.996 --> 04:11.412
I'm not allowed to call
black people black people?

04:11.437 --> 04:13.164
It's cool, man. No reason to blow up.

04:13.166 --> 04:15.164
Ah, terrorist joke. A first for me.

04:17.137 --> 04:19.295
So, Arthur, have you
considered my offer?

04:19.320 --> 04:20.959
Sorry, Fawz, I'm not selling the shop.

04:20.983 --> 04:22.273
Arthur, give it up!

04:22.275 --> 04:23.675
Fancy people are moving to Uptown,

04:23.677 --> 04:25.243
and they don't want donuts.

04:25.245 --> 04:26.778
They want to drink kale smoothies

04:26.780 --> 04:28.813
and not vaccinate their children.

04:29.613 --> 04:31.049
I'm afraid Fawz is right.

04:31.051 --> 04:32.951
Uptown is being gentrified.

04:32.953 --> 04:35.653
Low-income families and small
businesses are being pushed out

04:35.655 --> 04:37.355
by soulless chains and condominiums

04:37.357 --> 04:38.690
for rich white people.

04:38.692 --> 04:40.392
Uh, aren't you a rich white person?

04:40.394 --> 04:42.927
Yes, and I have to live with that

04:42.929 --> 04:44.854
every day of my life.

04:47.705 --> 04:50.301
So, Arthur, what do you
say? I give you good price.

04:50.700 --> 04:52.437
Just give me a couple of
days to think about it.

04:52.439 --> 04:53.972
No, you don't have to
think about it, man.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.940
'Cause you can't sell this place.

04:55.942 --> 04:57.609
It's the heart of this neighborhood.

04:57.611 --> 04:59.677
I remember when I was
six, my dad came back home

04:59.679 --> 05:01.479
with a box of Superior Donuts.

05:01.481 --> 05:03.748
We sat out on the porch
all night, eating donuts,

05:04.247 --> 05:05.283
watching them put up Christmas lights

05:05.285 --> 05:06.546
on the crack house across the street.

05:08.007 --> 05:09.015
Damn, they worked fast!

05:10.665 --> 05:11.447
Your point?

05:11.923 --> 05:13.820
My point is this
neighborhood is our home.

05:13.845 --> 05:15.727
And those people moving in...
They're not coming to join us.

05:15.729 --> 05:17.362
They're coming to push us out.

05:17.364 --> 05:19.204
And you got to push back, man.

05:19.478 --> 05:20.665
You built something here,

05:20.667 --> 05:22.634
and it deserves to live on.

05:22.636 --> 05:23.802
Who the hell is this guy?

05:23.804 --> 05:25.870
- Yeah, who the hell are you?
- Franco Wicks.

05:25.872 --> 05:27.605
He's Franco Wicks. He works here.

05:29.242 --> 05:30.442
Mark my words, Arthur.

05:30.444 --> 05:32.640
You will rue the day you said no to me!

05:33.531 --> 05:34.948
Ooh, that sounds a little terrorist-y.

05:36.792 --> 05:37.667
Sorry about that.

05:38.690 --> 05:39.706
Have a nice day.

05:42.055 --> 05:43.788
You will not regret this, man.

05:43.790 --> 05:45.929
I'm gonna help you bring this
place into the 20th century.

05:45.954 --> 05:47.258
Oh, you mean the 21st.

05:47.260 --> 05:47.931
No, I don't.

06:02.649 --> 06:04.683
What the hell you doing here so early?

06:04.685 --> 06:06.610
Did we discuss you painting my shop?

06:06.635 --> 06:08.892
I'm a self-starter,
man. You like the color?

06:08.917 --> 06:10.223
"It's called ancient ivory."

06:10.858 --> 06:11.770
Like you.

06:13.372 --> 06:14.653
Your jukebox ate my quarter.

06:14.692 --> 06:16.476
That thing hasn't worked for years.

06:16.501 --> 06:18.382
Oh, well, I was trying to
find some Biggie Smalls,

06:18.407 --> 06:19.452
and all they had was Little Richard.

06:20.534 --> 06:22.621
The next time you think of
painting, ask first, okay?

06:22.646 --> 06:24.418
Actually, you're doing
a pretty good job.

06:24.443 --> 06:28.056
- That's because I'm an artist.
- Really? Oil? Water color?

06:28.081 --> 06:29.048
I'm more of a street artist.

06:29.079 --> 06:32.077
Oh, graffiti, which is illegal. Yeah.

06:32.079 --> 06:33.218
Yeah, yeah. It's not graffiti.

06:33.243 --> 06:34.595
It's social commentary.

06:36.056 --> 06:37.082
Why is it like when a white dude

06:37.084 --> 06:38.717
like Banksy does it, it's great art,

06:38.719 --> 06:40.186
but when a black dude
does it, it's graffiti?

06:41.305 --> 06:42.148
Are you a racist?

06:42.173 --> 06:42.898
Not yet.

06:45.594 --> 06:48.093
Well, Basquiat started
as a street artist,

06:48.095 --> 06:49.558
so I suppose you're in good company.

06:49.583 --> 06:52.197
Basquiat? Donut Man
knows his art history.

06:52.199 --> 06:53.932
I'm shocked.

06:53.934 --> 06:56.301
Just because I own a donut
shop, I can't like art?

06:56.303 --> 06:58.470
I watch documentaries.

06:58.472 --> 06:59.547
I got Netflix.

07:01.250 --> 07:02.821
Morning, Arthur.

07:02.846 --> 07:03.884
Hey.

07:03.909 --> 07:05.173
Are you being robbed?

07:06.957 --> 07:08.463
- With this?
- I've seen it.

07:09.750 --> 07:11.549
No, no, he works here.

07:11.551 --> 07:13.356
Yeah, I work here, fat Bruce Willis.

07:13.497 --> 07:15.301
I've seen it.

07:15.465 --> 07:16.988
Name's Carl Tushinski.

07:16.990 --> 07:18.754
"People call me Tush."

07:18.925 --> 07:21.230
'Cause I got one you can
bounce a quarter off of.

07:25.173 --> 07:27.032
He's my most loyal customer.

07:27.034 --> 07:28.767
Yeah, he used to come
in here every morning

07:28.769 --> 07:30.569
before his shift at
the John Deere factory.

07:30.594 --> 07:32.522
Then he kept coming in when
the plant went belly-up.

07:32.547 --> 07:34.940
Best thing that ever happened to me.

07:34.942 --> 07:36.100
Now I work when I want

07:36.125 --> 07:38.743
"where I want. It's
called the gig economy"

07:38.745 --> 07:41.746
I deliver pizzas, walk
dogs, do some modeling.

07:41.748 --> 07:43.090
Mostly print.

07:44.718 --> 07:46.926
"I've done a hell of a
lot of before" pictures.

07:48.197 --> 07:50.664
You know, this place is
kind of like my office.

07:50.689 --> 07:53.425
Oh. Ew. Is that a fax machine?

07:53.427 --> 07:55.760
Yup. Does everything
your smart phone does,

07:55.762 --> 07:57.437
but I found mine on a curb.

07:59.406 --> 08:01.272
- So, Arthur?
- I got to make some donuts.

08:01.297 --> 08:03.247
I know, but I have some
ideas about boosting business.

08:03.310 --> 08:05.193
All right? Let's get some
free Wi-Fi in this place.

08:05.218 --> 08:07.091
Or we can pass out some
flyers at the weed dispensary.

08:07.116 --> 08:09.045
Oh! Or make this the weed dispensary!

08:10.143 --> 08:11.068
Are you married to donuts?

08:12.460 --> 08:14.506
I'm just playing, man. What's
your marketing budget like?

08:14.531 --> 08:16.435
I can totally amaze you with $1,000.

08:16.460 --> 08:18.193
Why don't you mildly
surprise me with $50?

08:19.943 --> 08:22.302
Mm, I get it... you ain't
got that kind of money.

08:22.357 --> 08:24.568
No, I got it... in my emergency fund.

08:24.631 --> 08:27.525
Good luck. He hasn't
touched that in 30 years.

08:27.527 --> 08:30.515
Well, you should, because
this is an emergency.

08:30.540 --> 08:32.671
If you don't do something, Starbucks
gonna put you out of business.

08:32.703 --> 08:35.678
- Come on, I can save you.
- Save me? Who are you... Black Jesus?

08:37.414 --> 08:39.070
Okay, first of all, that's redundant.

08:40.578 --> 08:43.150
I'm gonna give you, uh, $200.

08:43.176 --> 08:45.542
- Thank you.
- I don't want thanks. I want customers.

08:45.567 --> 08:48.206
Oh! Gig coming in!

08:52.020 --> 08:53.364
Huh.

08:53.389 --> 08:55.067
Hospital needs a fluid donor.

08:55.762 --> 08:57.442
Wonder if it's blood or sperm.

08:58.786 --> 09:01.026
Last time, I guessed wrong,
and they were not happy.

09:05.899 --> 09:07.137
Aah, Starbucks.

09:07.176 --> 09:09.301
Just opened. There's
already a line out the door.

09:09.326 --> 09:10.573
Which is a good thing.

09:10.598 --> 09:11.754
They will get sick of waiting,

09:11.779 --> 09:14.355
so I have a plan to
entice them over here.

09:14.380 --> 09:15.637
Sweatpants!

09:19.106 --> 09:20.533
This is my friend Sweatpants.

09:20.604 --> 09:23.096
He's gonna stand outside
and pass out flyers

09:23.121 --> 09:24.611
and look delicious.

09:26.065 --> 09:28.791
And I'm gonna post this video
on our new Instagram account.

09:28.955 --> 09:31.161
All right, Sweatpants, say your line.

09:31.163 --> 09:33.497
Who wants to go nuts for donuts?

09:36.107 --> 09:37.634
All right, Sweatpants, make us proud.

09:37.636 --> 09:40.370
And, look, don't go
north on Foster Avenue.

09:40.372 --> 09:41.927
Some of those sprinkles are gang colors.

09:44.185 --> 09:45.042
You really think that's gonna work?

09:45.044 --> 09:46.143
Absolutely.

09:46.145 --> 09:47.909
I also lined up a
poetry slam for tonight,

09:47.934 --> 09:50.314
and I posted a bunch of
dope-ass Yelp reviews.

09:50.316 --> 09:51.482
Dope-ass... that's good, right?

09:51.484 --> 09:53.417
Dope-ass is good. Trust me, Arthur.

09:53.419 --> 09:54.964
This is going to be your
biggest day in years.

09:54.980 --> 09:55.897
Yeah, well, that would be nice.

09:55.921 --> 09:57.921
Wish you had seen this
place in its heyday.

09:57.923 --> 10:00.023
The factory was doing
three shifts a day,

10:00.025 --> 10:02.526
people were having breakfast
all around the clock.

10:02.528 --> 10:04.995
- That's cool.
- Yeah, this place was stacked.

10:04.997 --> 10:06.396
- The jukebox was working.
- Yeah?

10:06.443 --> 10:09.933
The air was thick with the
smell of donuts and cigarettes.

10:09.935 --> 10:11.769
Wonder where those people are today.

10:11.771 --> 10:13.514
Probably dead from all
the donuts and cigarettes.

10:16.241 --> 10:17.989
Just saying, you can't
give someone a ticket

10:18.014 --> 10:18.942
for being annoying.

10:18.944 --> 10:21.178
I can, and I did.

10:21.180 --> 10:23.291
Fine, but I'm not paying it.

10:25.470 --> 10:28.719
Hey, Arthur, I just got
a flyer from a giant donut

10:28.721 --> 10:29.970
named Jockstrap?

10:31.533 --> 10:33.757
Actually, uh, his name is
Sweatpants, and I'm Franco.

10:33.759 --> 10:35.259
- Nice to meet you, Franco.
- What's up?

10:35.261 --> 10:36.560
I'm Randy DeLuca.

10:36.562 --> 10:37.995
I've known Randy since she was a kid.

10:37.997 --> 10:39.763
Dad was a stubborn S.O.B.

10:39.765 --> 10:42.299
He cheated at bowling
and never once left a tip.

10:42.301 --> 10:44.426
Best friend I ever had.

10:45.723 --> 10:48.305
Yeah, he started bringing me
here when I was a little girl.

10:48.307 --> 10:49.740
We'd come after school,

10:49.742 --> 10:52.542
after church, after Cubs games.

10:53.402 --> 10:54.535
I was kind of a porker.

10:56.097 --> 10:57.496
- You look pretty good now.
- Well,

10:57.558 --> 11:00.405
I don't know if I should be
flattered or drug test you.

11:01.202 --> 11:02.286
Be flattered.

11:02.288 --> 11:03.483
Or else wait three days.

11:07.046 --> 11:08.452
Hey, where'd that come from?

11:08.499 --> 11:10.022
Oh, I painted it. Let me show you.

11:11.483 --> 11:13.997
Oh! I must really trust you.

11:13.999 --> 11:15.952
I just turned my back on a Chicago cop.

11:18.141 --> 11:19.336
I'm not gonna shoot you.

11:19.338 --> 11:21.224
I got my body cam on.

11:22.779 --> 11:24.880
I call this <i>Arthur in
the Sky with Donuts.</i>

11:26.076 --> 11:27.599
My new employee's got
talent, don't you think?

11:27.654 --> 11:28.474
Mm-hmm.

11:28.498 --> 11:29.413
- You like this, Arthur?
- Yeah.

11:29.415 --> 11:31.381
You ought to think about
going to art school.

11:32.351 --> 11:34.084
Wait a minute, why am I so dark?

11:34.086 --> 11:36.520
That's because I repurposed
one of my old paintings.

11:36.522 --> 11:38.522
Uh, yesterday, those
donuts were basketballs,

11:38.524 --> 11:39.980
and you were Michael Jordan.

11:43.668 --> 11:45.529
Oh. This place is so retro.

11:45.531 --> 11:47.464
- Those Yelp reviews were right.
- Yeah.

11:47.466 --> 11:49.700
Oh, looks like our marketing
campaign is paying off.

11:49.702 --> 11:51.134
- Good job, kid.
- Mm.

11:51.136 --> 11:52.336
Welcome to Superior Donuts.

11:52.338 --> 11:53.871
May we interest you in one

11:53.873 --> 11:55.539
of our artisanal confections,

11:55.541 --> 11:58.609
handcrafted by our in-house donut-eer?

11:58.611 --> 12:00.777
Eh, I'm trying to stay away from dairy.

12:00.779 --> 12:02.648
Then let me move this creamer.

12:06.038 --> 12:07.184
Do you have anything soy-based?

12:07.186 --> 12:09.163
No, everything here is food-based.

12:10.498 --> 12:13.288
Can I interest you in my,
uh, famous maple crèmes?

12:13.506 --> 12:16.026
No, thanks. I'll have a
grande mocha macchiato.

12:16.028 --> 12:17.561
We only sell coffee.

12:17.563 --> 12:18.662
Isn't that coffee?

12:18.664 --> 12:22.178
"No, that's Italian for Overcharge
me, I'm a pretentious millennial."

12:24.475 --> 12:25.702
Let's get out of here.

12:26.421 --> 12:28.639
All right, learning curve. Um,

12:28.641 --> 12:30.641
all we got to do is adapt
to our new customer base.

12:30.643 --> 12:32.809
You know, let me, you know,
whip up some new flavors,

12:32.811 --> 12:34.211
like Sriracha or Nutter Butter.

12:34.213 --> 12:36.647
That is my department. I do the donuts.

12:37.650 --> 12:40.086
Uh, gig coming in.

12:43.155 --> 12:45.255
Well, guess who's going
to be the assailant

12:45.257 --> 12:47.187
at a women's self-defense class.

12:49.405 --> 12:51.210
I hope they give me a cup this time.

12:54.140 --> 12:55.521
Look at all those people, hmm?

12:55.546 --> 12:56.900
Not one of 'em wants a freaking donut.

12:57.359 --> 12:58.702
Screw you, Starbucks!

12:59.120 --> 13:00.902
And quit giving me that smug look!

13:00.927 --> 13:02.425
Stupid mermaid.

13:03.933 --> 13:05.595
- All right, so it's a rough day.
- Yeah.

13:05.620 --> 13:08.412
But don't worry. Your regulars
are gonna stand by you.

13:08.414 --> 13:10.314
Hello, my fellow Americans!

13:10.316 --> 13:13.283
- Did you go to Starbucks?
- Not cool, Fawz.

13:13.285 --> 13:15.452
What? I have a weak spot
for the caramel Frappuccino.

13:15.454 --> 13:18.155
Growing up in the marshes of
Iraq, all we had to drink was...

13:18.644 --> 13:20.386
Actually, we had these.
Starbucks is everywhere.

13:22.480 --> 13:23.449
That's something we could try, you know,

13:23.474 --> 13:25.462
get an espresso machine
and make those fancy drinks.

13:25.464 --> 13:27.664
- You mean spend more money? No.
- Arthur,

13:27.666 --> 13:29.433
today, you not have so many customers.

13:29.435 --> 13:31.969
Tomorrow will be worse. Sell to me.

13:31.994 --> 13:33.178
Sell to me right now!

13:34.952 --> 13:36.840
I apologize. This is my
fourth coffee drink of the day.

13:36.842 --> 13:38.439
I'm very just... Whew.

13:39.572 --> 13:41.678
All right, Fawz, how much
money we talking about?

13:41.680 --> 13:44.314
- No, Arthur, you can't sell the shop!
- Hey, stop telling me what to do.

13:44.316 --> 13:46.550
I gave you a chance.
Your ideas didn't work.

13:47.217 --> 13:49.186
Not the painting, not the flyers,

13:49.188 --> 13:50.554
not the chalkboard.

13:50.556 --> 13:52.138
Which has already been stolen.

13:53.943 --> 13:56.727
- That's it. I'm calling it.
- No, you said we could stay open late!

13:56.729 --> 13:57.894
We still have the poetry reading.

13:57.896 --> 13:59.427
Roses are red, no, we don't.

14:01.224 --> 14:02.899
You're making it really
hard for me to help you here.

14:02.901 --> 14:04.067
Well, I don't need your help!

14:04.069 --> 14:06.303
I got the best damn donuts in Chicago.

14:06.305 --> 14:08.405
I agree. So where are the customers?

14:08.407 --> 14:11.575
Huh? You don't think you scared
'em off 'cause you're too cranky

14:11.577 --> 14:13.256
and stubborn and stuck in the past?

14:13.295 --> 14:15.312
Who are you to come in here
and talk to me like that, huh?

14:15.314 --> 14:17.458
You come in here and tell
me how to run my business?

14:17.818 --> 14:18.749
You can't even keep a job.

14:18.751 --> 14:20.283
And you're barely
holding on to this one.

14:20.285 --> 14:22.185
Okay, guys, let's just
take it down a notch.

14:22.187 --> 14:24.187
Well, maybe I don't want to
work here. If you're just gonna

14:24.189 --> 14:26.456
roll over and let your
business die. That's weak.

14:26.458 --> 14:27.691
You calling me weak? Yeah.

14:27.693 --> 14:28.925
You're afraid to fight for something

14:28.927 --> 14:30.660
you poured your whole life into.

14:30.662 --> 14:32.562
At least go down swinging.

14:32.564 --> 14:33.864
You try or you die.

14:33.866 --> 14:35.499
Well, try this.

14:35.501 --> 14:37.034
You're fired.

14:43.988 --> 14:44.829
Oh. What's up, Franco?

14:44.854 --> 14:47.845
- Move, man.
- Hey. Where's he going?

14:48.030 --> 14:50.869
It's time for me to get my poetry on!

14:53.136 --> 14:53.950
You're the poet?

14:53.952 --> 14:55.886
Yep. Aw, damn.

14:56.292 --> 14:58.768
"Should've said, You know it."

15:03.542 --> 15:05.562
Ugh! I hate this neighborhood!

15:05.564 --> 15:07.185
It actually makes me miss Iraq.

15:08.435 --> 15:09.873
Except for the mustard gas.

15:10.420 --> 15:13.236
And the torture. And the
traffic on Ramadan. It's just...

15:13.238 --> 15:15.272
What's going on, Fawz?

15:15.274 --> 15:16.205
Follow me.

15:19.278 --> 15:22.179
Last night, someone did the
graffiti on the Starbucks sign.

15:22.181 --> 15:23.747
- I don't see it.
- Look closer.

15:23.749 --> 15:25.916
That thing the mermaid is
holding? Not a coffee cup.

15:25.918 --> 15:26.532
Oh. Yeah.

15:28.393 --> 15:30.253
And it no longer says
Starbucks," it says Star..."

15:30.255 --> 15:31.988
Now I see it. Yeah.

15:31.990 --> 15:33.990
How am I going to get rich
when people stand in the way

15:33.992 --> 15:36.102
of progress? Well,
I've called the police.

15:36.127 --> 15:37.861
They said whoever did
this is going to jail.

15:37.863 --> 15:40.330
Actually, I think I know who did it.

15:40.722 --> 15:41.768
The black guy?

15:41.800 --> 15:43.967
Fawz, you can't keep saying that!

15:43.969 --> 15:46.636
It would be like you calling me the Jew.

15:47.767 --> 15:49.259
Oh, my God, you call me that, don't you?

15:51.712 --> 15:53.329
I'm not so good with names!

15:58.093 --> 15:59.926
Hey, Arthur. Any chance you remember

15:59.928 --> 16:02.596
- the color of Franco's backpack?
- No, how would I...

16:02.598 --> 16:05.232
Brown. Actually, more of a chestnut.

16:05.234 --> 16:08.451
I remember, because it's the
same shade as his soulful eyes.

16:10.130 --> 16:12.615
Oh, right, I'm the only one
who got lost in those things.

16:12.646 --> 16:14.162
Nope. Me, too.

16:15.857 --> 16:17.646
Why are you asking me
about Franco's backpack?

16:17.671 --> 16:20.034
James is over talking
to the Starbucks manager.

16:20.059 --> 16:23.083
He got a glimpse of the person
who spray-painted his sign,

16:23.085 --> 16:25.118
and he was wearing a brown backpack.

16:25.120 --> 16:27.154
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

16:27.156 --> 16:28.488
It gets worse.

16:28.490 --> 16:30.100
Apparently, Franco's got priors.

16:30.147 --> 16:31.092
Nothing serious.

16:31.117 --> 16:33.627
All graffiti-related.
But he could be looking

16:33.629 --> 16:34.998
at doing jail time.

16:35.023 --> 16:36.920
Why you telling me? Kid
doesn't work here anymore.

16:36.945 --> 16:38.632
Well, he might need a character witness.

16:38.634 --> 16:40.233
I thought you could vouch for him.

16:40.235 --> 16:42.702
- Why would I do that?
- For one thing, he risked going to jail

16:42.704 --> 16:44.204
to get back at your competition.

16:44.206 --> 16:45.906
You know why you're mad, don't you?

16:45.908 --> 16:47.246
The kid got your hopes up.

16:47.271 --> 16:49.694
Yeah, and for what? It
didn't work out, did it?

16:49.719 --> 16:52.879
There goes 200 bucks. And 47 years.

16:52.881 --> 16:56.149
Oh, Arthur, I wish
my dad was still here.

16:56.151 --> 16:59.563
He'd put his arm around
you, look into your eyes,

16:59.588 --> 17:01.617
"and say, Get your
head out of your ass!"

17:01.642 --> 17:04.594
- What are you talking about?
- Franco was good for you.

17:04.618 --> 17:07.394
You've been just going through
the motions since Joanie died.

17:07.396 --> 17:10.696
Yesterday, you had a gleam in your eye.

17:10.699 --> 17:12.766
It was like you finally woke up again.

17:18.315 --> 17:19.945
What the hell? When
did that start working?

17:19.971 --> 17:21.180
Franco fixed it.

17:21.204 --> 17:22.909
Sounds pretty good, doesn't it?

17:22.911 --> 17:24.978
- Yeah, it does.
- See?

17:24.980 --> 17:26.946
The kid's good for you, Arthur.

17:30.496 --> 17:32.941
Not a very good repairman,
but he's good for you.

17:38.307 --> 17:39.459
Y'all can relax.

17:39.461 --> 17:40.760
I know I'm fired.

17:40.762 --> 17:43.396
I just came to get my paycheck.

17:43.398 --> 17:46.617
Franco, you mind telling us where
you were last night around 12:30?

17:46.680 --> 17:48.535
I don't know. Probably at home.

17:48.537 --> 17:50.670
- Franco.
- What?

17:50.672 --> 17:52.125
This is Mr. Patterson
from the Starbucks.

17:52.141 --> 17:52.884
That's it.

17:52.908 --> 17:54.109
That's the brown backpack.

17:54.156 --> 17:56.343
Please, you call that brown?

17:56.368 --> 17:57.593
It looks orange to me.

17:58.726 --> 18:00.429
But then again, those
self-defense ladies

18:00.454 --> 18:01.648
used real pepper spray.

18:02.931 --> 18:04.684
I'm sorry, Franco, we're
gonna have to take you in

18:04.686 --> 18:07.020
- for questioning.
- Okay. Can I call my mom?

18:07.022 --> 18:08.255
Can I call my mom?

18:08.678 --> 18:10.056
Uh, wait.

18:10.058 --> 18:11.725
This is my backpack.

18:11.727 --> 18:13.069
You're telling me that's yours?

18:13.094 --> 18:14.584
Yes, absolutely.

18:14.725 --> 18:16.874
You see, it's got my, um...

18:16.899 --> 18:17.937
afro pick.

18:20.484 --> 18:22.304
And, um, and it's got my...

18:23.295 --> 18:25.172
- oregano.
- Mm-hmm.

18:26.630 --> 18:28.041
And my spray paint.

18:28.043 --> 18:29.776
Which I used to, uh, deface your store.

18:29.778 --> 18:31.044
Okay.

18:31.046 --> 18:32.445
This is a load of crap.

18:32.447 --> 18:34.714
You're right. It is a load of crap.

18:35.191 --> 18:37.651
That I would commit such a, uh,

18:37.653 --> 18:39.019
senseless act of vandalism.

18:39.021 --> 18:40.824
But if you would, uh, drop the charges,

18:40.847 --> 18:44.214
I have $2,500 here

18:45.027 --> 18:47.227
in my, um, emergency fund.

18:48.047 --> 18:50.539
Be glad to give it to
you to cover the damages.

18:50.719 --> 18:52.469
Are you buying any of this?

18:53.844 --> 18:57.571
Well, the man said he did it.

18:59.813 --> 19:01.276
You want the money or not?

19:04.646 --> 19:06.580
Fine.

19:11.453 --> 19:13.835
And once again, the white man gets off!

19:21.330 --> 19:24.510
Hey.

19:24.541 --> 19:26.566
I appreciate that, man.

19:26.568 --> 19:28.001
And I'm sorry I got you involved.

19:28.003 --> 19:29.127
You shouldn't have wrecked that sign.

19:29.152 --> 19:31.460
I know, but I was pissed.

19:31.485 --> 19:33.343
I didn't want them putting
you out of business.

19:34.042 --> 19:35.351
You gave me a job.

19:36.011 --> 19:37.687
And you listened to my ideas.

19:38.937 --> 19:41.414
And you said I should go to art school.

19:41.416 --> 19:43.350
First time I mentioned
art school to my dad,

19:43.352 --> 19:44.645
he laughed in my face.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.786
What? The man who brought you donuts?

19:46.788 --> 19:48.888
It was kind of a one-time thing.

19:48.890 --> 19:50.991
Most of the time he was
just tearing me down,

19:50.993 --> 19:54.048
telling me I was nothing.

19:54.095 --> 19:55.392
I remember senior year of high school

19:55.548 --> 19:57.017
when I finally stood up to him.

19:57.699 --> 19:58.932
I got back home from school

19:58.934 --> 20:00.173
and all my stuff was on the street.

20:01.336 --> 20:04.037
I caught a dude trying
to steal my sweatpants.

20:04.039 --> 20:05.833
That's how I met Sweatpants.

20:09.279 --> 20:13.213
Well, I'm glad you're pursuing
your art, but no more vandalism.

20:13.215 --> 20:16.349
I can't keep bailing out my employees.

20:16.351 --> 20:17.797
You hiring me back?

20:17.898 --> 20:20.093
Yeah. How's that for ass-dope?

20:22.336 --> 20:23.453
It's dope-ass.

20:25.260 --> 20:27.527
- Thank you, man, I appreciate that.
- Yeah, well,

20:27.529 --> 20:29.593
it wouldn't kill me to try
some new things around here.

20:29.618 --> 20:31.364
You try or you die, right?

20:31.366 --> 20:33.033
Donut man.

20:33.035 --> 20:34.578
I'm really feeling the
urge to hug you right now.

20:34.603 --> 20:35.695
Resist it. All right.

20:36.371 --> 20:37.971
- Yeah.
- Okay.

20:37.973 --> 20:39.537
- Well, I'm gonna pay you back.
- Damn right.

20:39.576 --> 20:42.232
I'm gonna deduct ten percent out
of your salary till we're even.

20:42.302 --> 20:44.474
Sounds fair. Can I at
least get my oregano back?

20:44.499 --> 20:45.974
I'm taking ten percent of that, too.

20:48.005 --> 20:49.416
Well, you're gonna need
these donuts then, ain't you?
