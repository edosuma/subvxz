- He was this kid

03:49.195 --> 03:51.531
who went to PCA,

09:34.106 --> 09:35.374
- How?

09:35.441 --> 09:37.810
- [scoffs]
Come with me.

09:37.877 --> 09:39.045
- Wait, why me?

09:39.111 --> 09:40.680
You got five other friends
over there.

09:45.584 --> 09:47.386
What are you gonna do?
- Shh.

10:00.232 --> 10:02.234
- Ha.

10:02.301 --> 10:03.536
Oh, yeah.

10:03.602 --> 10:05.938
- That'll shake up a snake.
- Huh.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.008
- Onward and upward, ha.

10:24.724 --> 10:27.360
- Whoa, let's hold up
for a sec.

10:31.764 --> 10:33.799
- Well?
- Where's Red Stone Gulch?

10:33.866 --> 10:35.701
- Yeah, we've been hiking
for three hours.

10:35.768 --> 10:37.269
- Leif knows
what he's doing.

10:38.504 --> 10:39.872
You know what you're doing,
right?

10:39.939 --> 10:41.474
- Oh, yeah.
I just--

10:41.540 --> 10:43.476
I'm a little confused
by my compass.

10:51.550 --> 10:52.785
- That's weird.

10:52.852 --> 10:54.353
- Just tell us
which way's north.

10:54.420 --> 10:56.288
- Well, according
to this compass,

10:56.355 --> 11:01.660
north is that way, that way,
that way, this way, that way,

11:01.727 --> 11:04.263
and apparently just to the left
of my bladder.

11:04.997 --> 11:06.432
- [groans]

11:06.499 --> 11:08.134
All right, I have to study
for my test,

11:08.200 --> 11:10.936
so can we please go
back down to PCA right now?

11:12.505 --> 11:13.806
- Fair enough.
[chuckles]

11:17.076 --> 11:19.245
Okay, back to PCA.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.248
Pacific Coast Academy.

11:22.915 --> 11:24.984
Ocean views.

11:25.051 --> 11:26.886
- You don't know the way back,
do you?

11:26.952 --> 11:28.687
- No, I do not.

11:28.754 --> 11:30.523
Although I do have
some mustard.

11:47.273 --> 11:49.408
- Okay, how is scooping up dirt
gonna get us

11:49.475 --> 11:51.343
down this mountain
and back to PCA?

11:51.410 --> 11:52.945
- By throwing dirt dust
in the air,

11:53.012 --> 11:55.648
I can see which way the wind
is blowing, and that will

11:55.714 --> 11:57.850
help me get a directional
bearing back to PCA.

11:58.651 --> 11:59.585
Yeah.

12:00.553 --> 12:01.821
Oh.

12:01.887 --> 12:03.355
[spits]
[coughs]

12:04.857 --> 12:07.793
- So, the way back to PCA is
through Leif's face?

12:07.860 --> 12:10.362
[ducks quacking]

12:11.197 --> 12:12.932
- Hey, Mexican ducks.

12:12.998 --> 12:14.266
- Who cares?

12:14.333 --> 12:15.434
- Well, they're creatures
of nature.

12:15.501 --> 12:16.902
They can show us the way.

12:16.969 --> 12:18.804
- What?
- They're ducks.

12:18.871 --> 12:21.340
- Hey, wait, ducks, wait up!

12:21.407 --> 12:25.311
[speaking Spanish]

12:26.579 --> 12:28.848
- Okay, he's not
a very good guide.

12:30.449 --> 12:32.451
- Just go after him
so he doesn't get more lost.

12:32.518 --> 12:33.452
- Okay.

12:34.954 --> 12:37.623
- Oh, wait, take a walkie.

12:37.690 --> 12:38.724
- Thanks.

12:38.791 --> 12:42.061
Leif! Leif! Leif! Leif!

12:42.128 --> 12:45.731
- Uh-oh, Quinn's got something
weird attached to her face.

12:46.866 --> 12:48.534
- They're quinnoculars.

12:48.601 --> 12:51.704
Five lenses, see?
- Why five?

12:51.770 --> 12:54.840
- More powerful, better optical
clarity, night vision,

12:54.907 --> 12:56.742
and they even let you see
through some things

12:56.809 --> 12:57.810
in bright sunlight.

12:57.877 --> 12:59.645
- You can't see
through things.

13:05.684 --> 13:06.619
- Boxer briefs.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.621
- Oh, my God.

13:13.759 --> 13:15.661
- Ducks, hey!

13:15.728 --> 13:20.199
[speaking Spanish]

13:21.033 --> 13:22.434
- Leif!
- [groans]

13:22.501 --> 13:26.572
- Leif, yo--yo, Leif.

13:26.639 --> 13:29.575
- Hey, the ducks flew away.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.911
- Yes, that's what ducks do.

13:31.977 --> 13:33.112
- Oh.

13:33.179 --> 13:37.049
<i>ZOEY: Lola, did you find Leif?</i>

13:37.116 --> 13:38.717
- Yeah, I got him.

13:38.784 --> 13:40.853
We'll circle around and meet
you guys in about fifteen.

13:40.920 --> 13:43.055
- All right.

13:43.122 --> 13:45.858
- Listen, I got
a little confession.

13:45.925 --> 13:47.226
- Yeah?

13:47.293 --> 13:49.662
- I'm not really that good
a hiking guide.

13:49.728 --> 13:50.796
- No.

13:50.863 --> 13:52.131
- No, it's true.

13:52.198 --> 13:53.365
- Then why'd you say
you could lead us

13:53.432 --> 13:54.967
to Red Stone Gulch?

13:55.034 --> 13:56.368
- Well, I don't know,

13:56.435 --> 13:58.404
I guess I kind of wanted
to hang out with you.

13:59.405 --> 14:00.940
Is that bad or--

14:01.006 --> 14:02.174
- It's not good, Leif.

14:02.241 --> 14:04.443
- I knew it.
I'm unappealing.

14:05.211 --> 14:06.512
- No, but you lied

14:06.579 --> 14:07.980
and now you got us all lost.

14:08.047 --> 14:11.817
- Hey, lost just means
you've found something

14:11.884 --> 14:13.819
you weren't looking for.

14:13.886 --> 14:15.888
- Let's just get back
to the others, okay?

14:15.955 --> 14:18.224
- Sure.
I'll lead the way.

14:20.292 --> 14:22.161
- Log.
- [grunts]

14:24.430 --> 14:26.632
Careful,
there's a log there.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.100
- Thanks.

14:28.167 --> 14:29.435
- Oh, watch out.

14:29.501 --> 14:30.436
Okay.

14:42.381 --> 14:43.649
- Can you see anything?

14:43.716 --> 14:44.984
- No.

14:45.050 --> 14:46.919
I'll boost the zoom
on my quinnoculars.

14:49.355 --> 14:51.023
- I thought we decided to forget
Red Stone Gulch

14:51.090 --> 14:54.193
and find our way back to PCA
so we can study for our test.

14:54.260 --> 14:56.562
- Yeah. It's gonna be dark
in a couple of hours anyway.

14:56.629 --> 14:57.863
- You just wanna leave
'cause you know

14:57.930 --> 14:59.131
we're gonna find out
that the legend

14:59.198 --> 15:00.499
of Charles Galloway
is true.

15:00.566 --> 15:01.600
- Yeah.

15:02.234 --> 15:03.235
- [scream]

15:03.302 --> 15:04.970
- Whoa. Whoa.

15:05.037 --> 15:07.039
- I think I see
Red Stone Gulch!

15:07.106 --> 15:08.607
- [laughs]

15:10.709 --> 15:12.444
[ducks quacking]

15:13.812 --> 15:15.881
- Leif, maybe you should
let me lead the way.

15:15.948 --> 15:18.450
- I'm telling ya,
we're almost--

15:19.485 --> 15:20.452
oh.

15:24.123 --> 15:27.026
- Isn't this where we were
fifteen minutes ago?

15:27.092 --> 15:29.428
- Uh, yeah.

15:31.263 --> 15:33.198
You're irritated with me.
- Kinda.

15:33.265 --> 15:34.767
- I knew it.

15:49.748 --> 15:51.884
- Here we are.
This is it.

15:51.950 --> 15:53.452
- See? We made it.

15:53.519 --> 15:55.421
Red Stone Gulch.
[laughs]

15:55.988 --> 15:57.122
- Ha!

15:57.189 --> 15:58.757
- Why are you ha-ing?

15:58.824 --> 16:00.693
- You haven't proved that
Charles Galloway was ever here.

16:00.759 --> 16:03.295
- Just wait.
- We're gonna find evidence.

16:04.730 --> 16:07.833
- Yup, I brought
a portable metal detector.

16:07.900 --> 16:09.101
- Of course you did.

16:10.336 --> 16:12.438
- It also detects crabs,
bio-medical waste,

16:12.504 --> 16:14.673
and various types
of animal urine.

16:14.740 --> 16:17.443
- Well, now I know what to buy
Grandma for Christmas.

16:18.944 --> 16:21.880
[beeping]

16:25.417 --> 16:27.252
- I can't believe you get
yourself, me,

16:27.319 --> 16:28.954
and five other people lost
in the wilderness

16:29.021 --> 16:31.423
just 'cause you wanted
to hang out with me.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.660
- You think I'm silly.
- No, Leif.

16:34.727 --> 16:36.795
SpongeBob's friend Patrick
is silly.

16:36.862 --> 16:37.830
I think you're a weirdo.

16:39.231 --> 16:41.667
- Okay, so I'm
a little bit out there.

16:41.734 --> 16:45.270
- If by "out there" you mean
crazy, yeah, you're out there.

16:45.337 --> 16:48.807
- Ah, "I am but mad
north-north-west.

16:48.874 --> 16:52.778
When the wind is southerly,
I know a hawk from a handsaw."

16:53.645 --> 16:54.847
- That's from "Hamlet."

16:54.913 --> 16:57.049
That's, like,
my second favorite play.

16:57.116 --> 16:58.250
- What's your fave?

16:59.818 --> 17:01.353
- "The Importance
of Being Earnest."

17:01.420 --> 17:03.522
- Oh, yeah, I know it.
Uh, let's see.

17:04.890 --> 17:06.992
"My dear, sir, the way you
flirt with Gwendolen

17:07.059 --> 17:08.761
is perfectly disrespectful."

17:08.827 --> 17:10.362
both: "It's almost as bad
as the way

17:10.429 --> 17:11.763
Gwendolen flirts with you."

17:11.829 --> 17:13.832
- Excellent.
So you're an actress.

17:13.898 --> 17:15.901
- Totally.
- Nice.

17:15.968 --> 17:18.670
- Yeah.

17:18.737 --> 17:21.173
- Hey, are you
a hungry actress?

17:21.240 --> 17:22.608
- Starved.
- All right.

17:29.348 --> 17:31.717
Tangerine for you,
apple for me.

17:31.784 --> 17:33.585
- Thanks.
- Sure.

17:33.652 --> 17:36.155
<i>QUINN: You're sure you can tell</i>
<i>if a guy's a good kisser</i>

17:36.221 --> 17:37.156
<i>by the way he eats an apple?</i>

17:37.222 --> 17:38.424
<i>LOLA: It's a fact.</i>

17:47.800 --> 17:48.867
- What?

17:55.374 --> 17:56.842
All right, sweet.

18:02.481 --> 18:05.417
[beeps]

18:15.394 --> 18:16.762
- You guys find anything?

18:16.829 --> 18:17.863
- Not yet.

18:17.930 --> 18:18.864
- Anything in there?

18:18.931 --> 18:20.432
- Nope.
- Empty.

18:20.499 --> 18:22.968
[beeps]

18:23.035 --> 18:24.303
[loud beeps]

18:24.369 --> 18:25.838
- Hey, hey.
Found something.

18:39.651 --> 18:40.719
- What is it?

18:40.786 --> 18:42.721
- It looks like
an old PCA necklace.

18:43.622 --> 18:45.357
Here, give me some water.

18:49.695 --> 18:53.432
Hey, I...think there's a name
engraved on the back,

18:53.499 --> 18:56.134
but I can't make
these letters out.

18:57.436 --> 18:58.737
- I bet I can read it.

19:04.576 --> 19:05.544
Hold it up.

19:07.646 --> 19:08.413
Steady.

19:08.480 --> 19:09.848
Keep it really still.

19:17.389 --> 19:21.326
"Charles L. Galloway"!

19:21.393 --> 19:22.661
- Yes!
- Yes!

19:22.728 --> 19:23.962
- Talkin' 'bout yes!
- Ah, yes!

19:24.029 --> 19:25.130
- [laughs]
- Yeah, yeah!

19:25.197 --> 19:26.965
- Charles L. Galloway.

19:27.032 --> 19:28.767
- So it's true.

19:28.834 --> 19:31.270
- Wow.

19:31.336 --> 19:32.905
- I guess that means
we're standing

19:32.971 --> 19:37.509
right where he,
you know, died.

19:38.610 --> 19:39.778
- Yeah.
- You're probably right.

19:39.845 --> 19:41.146
- Yeah.
- Probably right around there.

19:41.213 --> 19:42.514
- Stay away from dead bodies.

19:42.581 --> 19:44.249
- Okay, we found it.
You guys are right.

19:44.316 --> 19:45.684
The legend is true.

19:45.751 --> 19:47.185
Now put it back and
let's get outta here.

19:47.252 --> 19:49.521
- Put it back?
Are you crazy?

19:49.588 --> 19:51.256
- It's not ours to take.

19:51.323 --> 19:53.458
- Dude, this necklace
is our proof.

19:53.525 --> 19:55.460
We'll be famous at PCA for being
the ones who've proved

19:55.527 --> 19:56.862
the legend
of Charles Galloway.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.431
And I own the movie rights.

19:59.498 --> 20:00.732
- You don't mess with a man's

20:00.799 --> 20:01.733
eternal resting place.

20:01.800 --> 20:03.135
- Yeah, I agree.

20:03.201 --> 20:04.570
- We leave it
where we found it.

20:04.636 --> 20:05.704
- You guys--

20:05.771 --> 20:09.908
- We leave it
where we found it.

20:09.975 --> 20:11.610
- Okay.
I'll put it back.

20:12.878 --> 20:14.546
- And don't even think
about trying

20:14.613 --> 20:16.415
to steal it,
'cause we're gonna frisk you--

20:18.150 --> 20:19.117
everywhere.

20:19.184 --> 20:20.385
- I'm not gonna steal it.

20:30.963 --> 20:32.864
- Hey, when you're done,
bring me my backpack.

20:33.599 --> 20:35.167
- Sure.

20:53.318 --> 20:55.454
- Thanks.

20:58.323 --> 21:02.127
Lola?
<i>Lola, you there?</i>

21:02.194 --> 21:03.528
- Hey, it's me.

21:03.595 --> 21:05.364
- We found Charles Galloway's
necklace.

21:05.430 --> 21:08.200
- No way.
- Yep. The legend's true.

21:08.266 --> 21:10.268
- Oh, my God,
that's so cool.

21:11.336 --> 21:13.972
[thunderclap]

21:14.039 --> 21:15.307
<i>LOLA: Was that thunder?</i>

21:16.508 --> 21:18.877
- Yeah.
Look, don't try and find us.

21:18.944 --> 21:20.646
Just head back to PCA.

21:20.712 --> 21:22.681
- How?
We don't know where we are.

21:22.748 --> 21:26.551
- Well, we went up to get here,
just go down.

21:26.618 --> 21:28.220
We'll meet you
at the lounge.

21:28.286 --> 21:31.423
- We'll try.

21:32.591 --> 21:34.292
- Mustard?
- I'm good.

21:38.897 --> 21:41.833
[thunderclaps]

21:46.738 --> 21:50.208
[thunderclaps]

21:50.275 --> 21:52.711
- Wow. That storm is coming in
pretty fast.

21:52.778 --> 21:56.081
- Yeah.
Let's get outta here.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.315
- Let's go.

22:01.119 --> 22:04.256
[thunderclaps]

22:22.741 --> 22:27.679
[screaming]

22:31.817 --> 22:34.219
- I've never seen a storm
come in this fast.

22:34.286 --> 22:35.721
The barometric conditions--

22:36.855 --> 22:39.524
[screaming]

22:40.726 --> 22:42.527
- That lightning
almost hit us!

22:42.594 --> 22:44.796
- I don't like lightning, man!
I don't like it at all!

22:44.863 --> 22:46.264
- It's just weather!

22:49.835 --> 22:53.405
[wind howling]

22:57.275 --> 22:58.343
- What is that?

22:58.410 --> 22:59.711
Green weather?

23:03.915 --> 23:06.518
- Okay. Would someone please
tell me what that is?

23:08.353 --> 23:11.223
- Oh, oh, I don't know.

23:11.289 --> 23:14.893
[screaming]

23:14.960 --> 23:15.894
- What do we do?

23:17.796 --> 23:19.564
- Run! Run!

23:19.631 --> 23:23.602
[screaming]

23:24.736 --> 23:25.871
Run! Run!

23:28.006 --> 23:33.145
[screaming]

23:37.215 --> 23:41.453
- [screaming]

23:46.725 --> 23:49.561
[wind howling]

23:53.932 --> 23:54.866
Zoey?

23:55.834 --> 23:56.935
Zoey!

24:00.205 --> 24:01.740
Zoey, where'd you go?

24:04.709 --> 24:06.211
- Chase!

24:09.714 --> 24:11.216
[screams]

24:15.987 --> 24:18.123
Ow!

24:19.958 --> 24:21.293
Chase?

24:21.359 --> 24:25.764
[wind howling]

24:25.831 --> 24:27.632
Chase!

24:30.135 --> 24:32.137
Ow.

24:33.271 --> 24:34.706
Chase?

24:41.313 --> 24:44.449
[wind howling]

24:50.355 --> 24:53.625
Chase! Chase!

25:00.465 --> 25:05.537
[screaming]

25:14.679 --> 25:15.714
Chase!

25:16.815 --> 25:18.617
- C'mon!
C'mon, let's go.

25:18.683 --> 25:20.518
- I can't.
I hurt my ankle.

25:29.394 --> 25:30.695
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

25:43.141 --> 25:45.043
- Mmm.

25:45.110 --> 25:46.177
[screaming]

25:46.244 --> 25:47.479
- What?
- What?

25:47.545 --> 25:49.814
- What?
- Why are you guys freaking out?

25:49.881 --> 25:51.750
- Because it's appropriate
to freak out

25:51.816 --> 25:54.886
when you've been attacked and
chased down a mountain by a--

25:54.953 --> 25:56.554
by a--
you know what.

25:56.621 --> 25:58.590
- It was just a storm.

25:59.624 --> 26:01.726
- Just a storm?
- Quinn!

26:01.793 --> 26:02.727
- [screams]

26:02.794 --> 26:04.129
- [screaming]

26:04.195 --> 26:05.830
Okay.

26:05.897 --> 26:07.432
That was a little freaky!

26:07.499 --> 26:08.700
- Leif thinks it was

26:08.767 --> 26:09.935
"just a storm."

26:11.269 --> 26:12.871
- Hey, where are
Zoey and Chase?

26:21.179 --> 26:22.347
- Okay.

26:23.882 --> 26:25.183
Okay.

26:26.051 --> 26:27.285
I think we're safe.

26:28.286 --> 26:29.587
So how are you?

26:29.654 --> 26:30.822
- What happened up there?

26:32.357 --> 26:33.625
- Tornado?

26:33.692 --> 26:36.761
- Yeah, just your average
green tornado.

26:38.496 --> 26:40.532
Now c'mon, let's all
just quit pretending

26:40.598 --> 26:42.267
we don't know what it was,
'cause we all know

26:42.334 --> 26:43.902
exactly what it was.

26:43.969 --> 26:46.271
- A swarm
of radioactive fireflies?

26:49.808 --> 26:53.445
- It wasn't a tornado
or fireflies.

26:55.146 --> 26:56.848
It was a--
- Don't say it.

26:56.915 --> 26:58.883
- --ghost.
- La, la, la, la, la--

26:58.950 --> 27:00.652
- It was the ghost
of Charles Galloway.

27:01.820 --> 27:03.121
Logan, you know it was a ghost,
Logan.

27:03.188 --> 27:04.689
- Hey, Logan,
what are you doing?

27:04.756 --> 27:06.624
- Stop going la-la-la-la!
That's not productive!

27:06.691 --> 27:08.360
- You're just scared!
You're just a Mama's boy, Logan!

27:08.426 --> 27:09.761
You know it was a ghost!
You don't want to admit it!

27:09.828 --> 27:10.762
- La, la, la, la, la--

27:10.829 --> 27:11.930
- You can't handle this!

27:11.997 --> 27:13.932
- What are you doing?
Logan, stop it!

27:18.737 --> 27:21.039
- You really think
it could've been a ghost?

27:21.106 --> 27:22.474
- I don't know.
I just--

27:22.540 --> 27:24.709
I never believed
in all that stuff.

27:24.776 --> 27:26.111
- Me either.

27:26.177 --> 27:28.013
- There's gotta be
some sort of explanation.

27:28.079 --> 27:29.647
- A trick?
- C'mon.

27:29.714 --> 27:31.416
Even Logan with his money
can't create

27:31.483 --> 27:33.818
a huge thunder
and lightning storm and that--

27:33.885 --> 27:36.821
that green cloud thing,
whatever that was.

27:38.590 --> 27:40.792
Anyway, it's over.

27:40.859 --> 27:42.961
- Yeah.
Ow.

27:43.028 --> 27:44.596
[winces]

27:44.662 --> 27:46.264
- I gotta get you
to the infirmary.

27:47.232 --> 27:48.533
Get that ankle looked at.

27:49.434 --> 27:50.635
Arms around my neck.

27:53.738 --> 27:55.240
[groaning]

27:55.306 --> 27:57.342
- Don't groan
when you lift me.

27:57.409 --> 27:58.743
- I'm not used to carrying
humans around

27:58.810 --> 28:00.678
in my arms
for long distances.

28:00.745 --> 28:02.614
- Well, maybe you should
go to a gym.

28:03.281 --> 28:04.649
- Oh, the sass.

28:05.216 --> 28:07.752
<i>[music]</i>

28:07.819 --> 28:10.388
<i>MAN: Ethel, why don't you just</i>
<i>shut your big bazoo?</i>

28:10.455 --> 28:12.424
<i>WOMAN: Fred!</i>
<i>MAN: No, it's--</i>

28:12.490 --> 28:14.993
- Ah, Fred Mertz, you stud.
[laughs]

28:15.060 --> 28:16.461
[phone ringing]

28:17.562 --> 28:19.898
Oh.
PCA health center.

28:20.765 --> 28:21.699
Oh, hey, baby.

28:22.767 --> 28:24.602
No, it's mostly empty tonight.

28:25.437 --> 28:27.472
Just one kid in here.

28:29.107 --> 28:31.609
She had some kind
of emotional breakdown in class,

28:31.676 --> 28:34.946
so the school psychologist
put her in here for mental rest.

28:35.713 --> 28:37.482
[laughs]

28:37.549 --> 28:38.950
- It's not funny.

28:39.017 --> 28:40.452
- Quiet, crazy.
- Eh.

28:41.886 --> 28:43.688
- Almost there.

28:43.755 --> 28:44.689
Easy does it.

28:45.824 --> 28:46.991
Hey, listen.

28:47.058 --> 28:48.193
I got a girl
with a broken ankle here,

28:48.259 --> 28:50.095
I think.
- Oh, crud.

28:50.161 --> 28:51.362
Call you later.

28:51.429 --> 28:53.031
Put her on that bed there.

28:53.098 --> 28:54.432
- Right.

28:54.499 --> 28:56.334
- Ow, ow, ow.
- Almost there.

28:57.535 --> 29:00.505
Pain is just in the mind.
- Oh, ow.

29:04.542 --> 29:05.844
- Don't touch it.

29:05.910 --> 29:07.278
- I'm stupid.

29:07.345 --> 29:10.014
- Zoey, what happened?
Some kind of accident?

29:10.081 --> 29:11.783
- Yeah, sorta.

29:11.850 --> 29:13.284
- I see.

29:14.252 --> 29:15.854
- Hey, can I use
the phone?

29:15.920 --> 29:17.288
- I don't care.

29:23.962 --> 29:24.896
- Zoey, look.

29:26.998 --> 29:28.633
It's a Stonehenge trilithon,

29:28.700 --> 29:31.503
made only of cotton swabs
and white glue.

29:35.773 --> 29:39.911
[phone ringing]

29:41.079 --> 29:42.547
- Lounge.

29:42.614 --> 29:44.649
Where are you?
Okay, yeah.

29:44.716 --> 29:46.484
Yeah, all right,
I'll be right there.

29:46.551 --> 29:47.852
- Chase?
- Where are they?

29:47.919 --> 29:49.187
- The infirmary.

29:49.254 --> 29:50.488
He thinks Zoey
has a broken ankle.

29:51.523 --> 29:52.757
- Oh, my God.
I gotta go.

29:52.824 --> 29:54.492
- Okay.
Oh, hey.

29:54.559 --> 29:56.794
Look, I'm sorry
I got you lost.

29:56.861 --> 29:58.296
- Lost just means
I found something

29:58.363 --> 29:59.831
I wasn't looking for.

29:59.898 --> 30:04.302
- Wow. It sounds so much
less stupid when you say it.

30:04.369 --> 30:06.504
- I know.

30:07.438 --> 30:12.744
[both moaning]

30:12.810 --> 30:14.212
- All right,
now it's getting gross.

30:14.279 --> 30:15.713
Let's go.
- Go.

30:15.780 --> 30:16.714
- God.

30:19.684 --> 30:23.388
- There. Keep that leg still,
eat that soup,

30:23.454 --> 30:24.856
and don't spit on the floor.

30:24.923 --> 30:27.525
- Aw, she can't
spit on the floor?

30:27.592 --> 30:29.460
- I don't like
your brand of comedy.

30:29.527 --> 30:31.296
- Understood.
- All right.

30:32.430 --> 30:33.731
I'm gonna go nuke
a burrito.

30:35.900 --> 30:38.002
- So, pretty weird
out there tonight.

30:39.137 --> 30:40.638
- It couldn't have been a ghost.

30:40.705 --> 30:42.373
Could it?

30:42.440 --> 30:44.475
- If it was, it was definitely
an angry ghost.

30:45.376 --> 30:48.246
- I know.
Why?

30:48.313 --> 30:50.582
- Maybe Charles Galloway
didn't like us

30:50.648 --> 30:52.650
messing around his place.

30:52.717 --> 30:57.989
You know, I mean, the place
he used to live before he, uh--

30:59.724 --> 31:01.192
stopped living.

31:02.460 --> 31:03.661
- Or, maybe it was just

31:03.728 --> 31:05.463
some kind
of freaky weather thing?

31:06.564 --> 31:07.765
- Yeah,
we'll just go with that.

31:08.733 --> 31:09.701
Eat your soup.

31:11.202 --> 31:12.337
- Ah.

31:13.304 --> 31:15.106
Chase!
- What?

31:15.173 --> 31:16.341
- Look in the bowl.

31:18.476 --> 31:21.646
- Wow, you really must hate
chicken noodle soup.

31:22.313 --> 31:23.381
- Chicken noo--

31:25.316 --> 31:26.651
CHASE: You okay?

31:26.718 --> 31:28.253
- Umm, yeah.

31:29.487 --> 31:30.888
I'm just--

31:30.955 --> 31:32.957
I guess I'm just tired.

31:33.024 --> 31:35.026
Hiking all the way up
to Red Stone Gulch

31:35.093 --> 31:36.227
just made me--

31:37.262 --> 31:39.330
- Ugh.
Fork.

31:41.032 --> 31:46.204
[laughter]

31:46.271 --> 31:48.973
B--b--b--butt--face.

31:49.040 --> 31:50.775
[laughter]

31:52.610 --> 31:54.445
- Did you call me butt-face?

31:54.512 --> 31:56.914
- No. It's just your butt.

31:56.981 --> 31:58.916
- Yeah, well we'll see
what yours looks like

31:58.983 --> 32:00.652
when you get to be my age.

32:02.954 --> 32:04.689
I forgot the tomatillo salsa.

32:04.756 --> 32:06.391
Watch the phones
'till I get back.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.994
- You didn't see something wrong
with her butt?

32:10.061 --> 32:12.597
- Well, I mean, sure,
it wouldn't kill her

32:12.664 --> 32:15.066
to do some squats,
you know, just to--

32:15.133 --> 32:16.734
- That's not what I meant.

32:16.801 --> 32:18.803
- Maybe you just need
some sleep.

32:20.171 --> 32:21.439
- Yeah.

32:21.506 --> 32:23.007
Wait, I can't sleep.

32:23.074 --> 32:24.842
We have our economics test
first thing in the morning.

32:36.921 --> 32:39.991
- Any idea what's going on
in here?

32:40.058 --> 32:41.459
- No, not really.

32:50.935 --> 32:52.637
- Who opened the window?

32:53.738 --> 32:54.972
[screams]

32:59.510 --> 33:01.512
Oh, my swabs!

33:02.146 --> 33:03.948
[groans]

33:06.217 --> 33:07.352
[screaming]

33:09.954 --> 33:10.888
- Zoey!

33:12.490 --> 33:14.192
- Get this bucket
off my head.

33:14.859 --> 33:17.862
- [screams]

33:17.929 --> 33:20.131
[eerie moaning]

33:20.198 --> 33:21.332
- Get it off.

33:22.433 --> 33:23.368
- Will you guys slow down?

33:23.434 --> 33:24.602
It's just an injury.

33:24.669 --> 33:25.603
- Be quiet.
What'd Chase say?

33:25.670 --> 33:27.004
- That Zoey broke her ankle.

33:27.071 --> 33:28.873
- How'd she break it?
- He didn't say.

33:28.940 --> 33:30.141
He just said that
they were in the--

33:30.208 --> 33:31.809
[clatter]

33:31.876 --> 33:33.644
[screaming]

33:36.981 --> 33:38.049
- Chase!

33:38.116 --> 33:39.050
- Zoey!

33:39.117 --> 33:41.285
<i>CHASE: Oh! Oh! Oh!</i>

33:41.352 --> 33:42.587
<i>STACEY: Zoey!</i>

33:43.254 --> 33:46.057
- [screams]

33:46.124 --> 33:47.458
- Okay.

33:47.525 --> 33:49.193
That's not normal.

33:49.260 --> 33:50.194
- Nope.

33:50.261 --> 33:52.530
[screaming]

33:53.197 --> 33:59.270
[all screaming]

34:09.947 --> 34:11.916
[screaming]

34:13.484 --> 34:16.420
- [whimpers]

34:19.257 --> 34:21.926
- Will somebody get this
freakish bucket off my head?

34:24.529 --> 34:26.464
- Why won't this door open?

34:26.531 --> 34:29.634
- I wanna go back to
Massachusetts!

34:34.672 --> 34:37.007
[laughter]
- What is it?

34:37.074 --> 34:39.143
- It's the ghost
of Charles Galloway.

34:39.210 --> 34:40.678
- No, it's not.

34:40.745 --> 34:42.612
You tell him there's
no such thing as ghosts.

34:42.679 --> 34:45.550
- Fine, I'll tell him.
You tell that ghost.

34:45.616 --> 34:48.418
- You guys, Zoey and Chase
are in there.

34:48.485 --> 34:50.321
- [squeals]

34:50.388 --> 34:51.621
- We gotta go help 'em.

34:52.356 --> 34:53.591
- You help 'em.

34:53.658 --> 34:54.592
- What, the three of you
are just gonna let me

34:54.659 --> 34:55.592
go in there alone?

34:55.659 --> 34:56.793
- Yes.
- Bye.

34:56.860 --> 34:57.895
- Go!

35:01.499 --> 35:03.434
[screaming]

35:04.335 --> 35:06.137
- [screams]

35:13.177 --> 35:16.180
- Chase!
- [screams]

35:16.247 --> 35:17.782
- Why won't this door open?

35:17.849 --> 35:19.383
- Chase, Zoey.
You guys in there?

35:19.450 --> 35:21.118
- Michael? Is that you?
- Yeah.

35:21.185 --> 35:23.421
I think something weird's
going on in there.

35:23.488 --> 35:24.689
- Ya think?

35:24.755 --> 35:26.424
- Who are you talking to?

35:26.491 --> 35:28.559
- Michael.
[screaming]

35:28.626 --> 35:32.630
- Man, you gotta get
this door open.

35:32.697 --> 35:35.266
- Stand back.
I'll break it down.

35:35.333 --> 35:36.467
- Okay.

35:43.508 --> 35:45.042
- Why'd you open the door?

35:45.109 --> 35:46.577
- It opened by itself.

35:46.644 --> 35:48.846
- Who are you talking to?

35:48.913 --> 35:50.915
- Why does Zoey have a bucket
on her head?

35:50.982 --> 35:52.683
- [screams]

35:55.186 --> 35:57.755
I am so out of here.

36:01.058 --> 36:04.395
My cotton swabs.
Ah!

36:04.462 --> 36:06.664
- Man, we need to get
outta this room.

36:06.731 --> 36:08.132
- Zoey can't walk.

36:09.267 --> 36:10.601
- There's a gurney in the hall.

36:10.668 --> 36:11.802
- Help me get her.

36:12.537 --> 36:13.738
- [groans]

36:14.805 --> 36:15.940
Ow!
- Put it on.

36:16.007 --> 36:17.575
- All right. It's on, it's on.

36:18.109 --> 36:19.010
Come on.

36:22.446 --> 36:23.581
- Ah!

36:27.752 --> 36:29.053
- Careful with me.

36:30.988 --> 36:33.190
Just get this stupid bucket
off my head.

36:34.659 --> 36:36.761
- I can't; it's stuck.
Just hang on.

36:37.528 --> 36:38.396
- Just go, go, go.

36:38.462 --> 36:39.664
- I'm going, I'm going.

36:39.730 --> 36:41.332
- Go faster.
- I'm trying.

36:41.399 --> 36:43.134
- Ah!
- Just calm down.

36:43.200 --> 36:44.135
- Run!

36:44.936 --> 36:47.405
[screaming]

36:47.471 --> 36:48.906
- What is happening?

36:49.707 --> 36:50.641
- Are you guys okay?

36:50.708 --> 36:51.742
- Not really.

36:51.809 --> 36:53.210
- What's happening?

36:53.277 --> 36:55.613
- I'm not sure,
but I think that's

36:55.680 --> 36:57.481
the ghost of Charles Galloway
in there.

36:57.548 --> 36:59.016
- I'm sure.

36:59.083 --> 37:00.017
- What do we do?

37:00.084 --> 37:01.719
- [screaming]

37:02.853 --> 37:04.589
- I think you should
go get Zoey.

37:04.655 --> 37:06.223
- What is happening?

37:06.290 --> 37:07.358
Am I rolling?

37:07.425 --> 37:08.793
- Hold on!

37:08.859 --> 37:11.095
I'll be back.
- I am gonna kill somebody.

37:11.162 --> 37:13.264
- Figure out a way
to get rid of that ghost.

37:13.331 --> 37:14.899
- Hey!
- Go.

37:14.966 --> 37:16.968
- There's no such thing
as ghosts.

37:19.437 --> 37:22.440
[screaming]

37:22.506 --> 37:23.874
- Okay.

37:23.941 --> 37:26.510
Either that was a ghost,
or the infirmary just sneezed.

37:27.311 --> 37:28.379
- I know what to do.

37:28.446 --> 37:30.748
Come help me.

37:30.815 --> 37:33.985
Come on!
- All right, go. Go!

37:35.119 --> 37:36.554
- Hurry.
- I am.

37:36.621 --> 37:39.123
- We're hurrying.

37:39.190 --> 37:40.257
MICHAEL: I got the site up.

37:40.324 --> 37:43.561
Paranormal411.com.

37:43.628 --> 37:44.595
- Search for astro-magnaplasm,

37:44.662 --> 37:46.664
and read me everything it says.

37:47.632 --> 37:50.134
- Astro-magnaplasm.

37:53.604 --> 37:55.206
- Hand me the cobalt jellicose.

37:55.272 --> 37:56.540
- Cobalt jello what?

37:56.607 --> 37:59.644
- The blue jiggly stuff
in that thing.

37:59.710 --> 38:02.780
- Like I should know
what "jellicose" means.

38:02.847 --> 38:05.016
- Give me that tube
of crystallized ectoparticles.

38:05.983 --> 38:06.917
Yes.

38:08.219 --> 38:09.520
- Here, here we go.

38:09.587 --> 38:11.889
"Astro-magnaplasm.'

38:13.591 --> 38:16.293
"In the event of a
non-corporeal manifestation

38:16.360 --> 38:18.062
"of the spirit or soul
of a person,

38:18.129 --> 38:22.066
"which has remained on Earth
after the person's passing--"

38:24.001 --> 38:25.870
- Zoey. Slow down!

38:25.936 --> 38:26.871
- What?

38:27.872 --> 38:28.639
- Stairs.

38:28.706 --> 38:30.474
- What?
- Stairs.

38:30.541 --> 38:31.976
- What stairs?

38:32.877 --> 38:34.178
- Jump. Now!

38:39.083 --> 38:40.584
- Wow, you jumped.

38:40.651 --> 38:42.520
- Why didn't you get
the bucket off my head?

38:42.586 --> 38:44.055
What is the matter with you?

38:45.089 --> 38:47.124
- Stop it. Stop it.

38:47.191 --> 38:48.959
- I just need some rest.

38:49.026 --> 38:51.162
Maybe sometimes the first key
in the--

38:51.228 --> 38:53.597
[screams]

38:56.400 --> 38:57.535
Ow!

39:03.107 --> 39:06.143
My life is
an endless vortex of pain.

39:06.944 --> 39:11.782
[grunting]

39:15.953 --> 39:17.321
- Slow down.

39:17.388 --> 39:19.323
- You want that green
whatever-it-is to catch us?

39:19.390 --> 39:21.125
- No, but I have
ankle issues.

39:21.192 --> 39:22.526
- Hey, wait up.

39:24.895 --> 39:26.097
- Are you okay?

39:26.163 --> 39:27.765
- I've had better nights.
You know,

39:27.832 --> 39:29.100
when my ankle didn't break
and a ghost wasn't

39:29.166 --> 39:31.068
trying to kill us.
- Don't worry.

39:31.135 --> 39:32.703
- Yeah, Quinn's got us
hooked up.

39:35.673 --> 39:37.742
- What are those?
Are they gonna explode?

39:37.808 --> 39:40.144
- No.
Not right now.

39:40.211 --> 39:43.981
This jellicon orb contains
positively charged ion particles

39:44.048 --> 39:45.783
and this one contains
negatively--

39:45.850 --> 39:47.952
- Human words, Quinn,
human words.

39:48.018 --> 39:50.387
- When the ghost appears,
I throw this orb at it.

39:50.454 --> 39:51.756
- And I throw this one.

39:51.822 --> 39:53.524
- And they'll rupture,
each releasing

39:53.591 --> 39:55.793
a gaseous burst
of kinetic bio-energy--

39:55.860 --> 39:56.927
- Quinn.

39:56.994 --> 39:57.962
- It'll make the ghost
go away.

39:58.028 --> 39:59.163
There, did you
understand that?

39:59.230 --> 40:00.531
- Let's just do this.

40:00.598 --> 40:03.167
- Okay, but how do we
attract the ghost?

40:03.234 --> 40:05.069
- I don't think
that's gonna be too tough.

40:10.141 --> 40:12.076
- And here he comes.

40:12.143 --> 40:13.911
- I'm ready to throw
my gaseous orb.

40:13.978 --> 40:16.347
- No, we can't do it outside.

40:16.413 --> 40:18.315
We have to be
in a sealed environment.

40:18.382 --> 40:19.984
- What?

40:20.050 --> 40:21.051
- A room.

40:22.586 --> 40:23.821
- Come on, let's go.

40:34.732 --> 40:36.867
- Ow, ow, ow, ow.

40:39.837 --> 40:41.739
- Okay, everyone
against the wall.

40:48.078 --> 40:49.113
- Now what?

40:49.180 --> 40:50.681
- When it comes
through the door,

40:50.748 --> 40:52.750
I'll yell, "orbs away,"
and then we throw the orbs

40:52.817 --> 40:54.018
right at its center.

40:54.084 --> 40:55.886
- I'm gonna lose an eye.
I know it.

40:55.953 --> 40:57.521
I just know I'm gonna
lose an eye.

40:57.588 --> 40:59.890
- Shh.
- Just watch the door.

41:06.730 --> 41:10.301
- Um, I don't think it's coming
through the door.

41:10.367 --> 41:12.837
[groans]
- Get away from the windows!

41:12.903 --> 41:17.842
[screaming]

41:21.879 --> 41:24.181
- Quinn, will you say
"orbs away" already?

41:24.248 --> 41:25.416
- Are you ready, Michael?

41:25.482 --> 41:29.353
[eerie groaning]
Ready? Ready?

41:29.420 --> 41:30.554
- Just give me it.

41:32.323 --> 41:33.657
- Orbs away!

41:36.527 --> 41:41.665
[screaming]

41:57.414 --> 41:58.349
- I think it worked.

41:58.415 --> 42:00.718
- Yeah. It's gone.

42:04.321 --> 42:09.460
[eerie groaning]

42:12.463 --> 42:14.865
- Well, hello again.

42:18.202 --> 42:20.471
- Okay, Quinn, now what?

42:20.537 --> 42:24.508
- Well, speaking scientifically,
run!

42:24.575 --> 42:29.780
[screaming]

42:39.790 --> 42:42.326
- Why does the ghost
of Charles Galloway hate us?

42:42.393 --> 42:43.794
- And keep attacking us?

42:43.861 --> 42:45.262
- I guess he's mad
'cause we disturbed

42:45.329 --> 42:46.563
his eternal resting place.

42:46.630 --> 42:48.065
- But we left it
just like we found it.

42:48.132 --> 42:50.100
- Yeah, we put his necklace back
and everything.

42:52.736 --> 42:53.971
You put the necklace back.

42:55.506 --> 42:57.207
Didn't you?
- Didn't you?

43:00.277 --> 43:01.578
- Hand me your backpack.

43:05.516 --> 43:08.152
- I can't believe this.

43:10.654 --> 43:12.089
- Oh, come on.

43:12.156 --> 43:13.857
Are you kidding me?
- Oh, my God.

43:13.924 --> 43:15.092
- I can't believe you,
Logan.

43:15.159 --> 43:16.994
- We gotta put
that necklace back.

43:17.061 --> 43:19.330
- I think we should beat
the snot outta Logan first.

43:19.396 --> 43:20.764
- No.
- No?

43:20.831 --> 43:21.999
- We put the necklace back,

43:22.066 --> 43:23.600
then we beat the snot
outta Logan.

43:23.667 --> 43:24.735
- That's right.
- Very good.

43:24.802 --> 43:26.804
- I have--I have issues
with this plan.

43:26.870 --> 43:29.139
- If that ghost doesn't
kill you, I will, Logan.

43:29.206 --> 43:30.708
- No, you won't.
- I will get to you, Logan!

43:30.774 --> 43:33.010
- It's over!
- No!

43:51.962 --> 43:54.531
- So, should we say
some words?

43:58.836 --> 44:02.539
- Well, Charles,
we're sorry we disturbed you.

44:03.774 --> 44:05.209
We're sorry we took
your necklace.

44:05.275 --> 44:09.546
But it's back now,
so please stop terrifying us.

44:10.180 --> 44:12.016
ALL: Amen.

44:18.222 --> 44:21.191
- There. It's done.

44:21.258 --> 44:23.093
- Good.

44:23.160 --> 44:25.729
- I cannot believe
we've been up all night.

44:26.897 --> 44:28.165
- Oh, my God,
our econ exam.

44:28.232 --> 44:29.800
- And we get a zero
if we're late.

44:29.867 --> 44:31.902
- Oh, man.
- So run.

44:31.969 --> 44:34.571
- Come on.
- I can't run, my ankle.

44:36.240 --> 44:37.975
- Come on.
Jump on, Brooks.

44:40.310 --> 44:41.645
Hey, say good luck.

44:41.712 --> 44:42.846
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

44:42.913 --> 44:46.050
- All right, come on.
- Run.

44:49.219 --> 44:50.821
- I wanna know who did this.

44:51.822 --> 44:52.990
What did you think?

44:53.057 --> 44:55.125
That by vandalizing
my classroom,

44:55.192 --> 44:58.128
that you would
get out of taking this exam?

44:59.329 --> 45:02.900
Who did this
to my classroom?

45:06.437 --> 45:08.205
- Hello.
- Hi.

45:08.272 --> 45:09.206
- We're here.

45:09.273 --> 45:11.175
- You're late.

45:11.241 --> 45:12.943
- We know.

45:13.010 --> 45:16.246
- Yeah, all right,
this is gonna sound weird,

45:16.313 --> 45:19.450
but last night,
our friend Quinn,

45:19.516 --> 45:21.485
she had
these two glowing balls of--

45:21.552 --> 45:23.720
- Just sit down.

45:23.787 --> 45:27.691
I am trying to find out
which one of these hooligans

45:27.758 --> 45:31.328
destroyed this classroom.

45:31.395 --> 45:35.099
- Oh, that was kinda us.

45:35.833 --> 45:37.101
- You?

45:37.167 --> 45:40.170
- Well, I mean,
it wasn't our fault exactly.

45:40.237 --> 45:45.075
- Yeah, actually, it was
the ghost of Charles Galloway.

45:45.142 --> 45:46.610
- It was.
- What?

45:47.544 --> 45:49.246
Is this some kind of a joke?

45:49.313 --> 45:51.582
- No.
He was your student.

45:51.648 --> 45:52.816
- Fifty years ago.

45:52.883 --> 45:54.985
- And you know
how the legend says

45:55.052 --> 45:57.521
that he supposedly went
up to Red Stone Gulch?

45:57.588 --> 45:59.723
- Silence!

45:59.790 --> 46:03.494
I've heard that silly legend
for half a century

46:03.560 --> 46:07.097
and it is a lie.
- Yeah, not really.

46:07.164 --> 46:10.601
- Charles Galloway never went
up to Red Stone Gulch.

46:10.667 --> 46:13.437
And there is no such thing
as ghosts.

46:17.040 --> 46:19.143
- What was that?

46:20.744 --> 46:24.781
- Since you children have
such active imaginations,

46:24.848 --> 46:26.517
perhaps I should
have you all--

46:28.585 --> 46:34.725
Oh!
[laughter]

46:41.798 --> 46:43.500
Your exam is cancelled.

46:44.468 --> 46:45.903
Class dismissed.

46:48.972 --> 46:53.911
[cheering]

46:56.580 --> 46:58.482
- Thanks, Charles.

47:32.883 --> 47:33.850
[ding]

47:33.917 --> 47:35.852
<i>MAN: Mmm.</i>

47:35.919 --> 47:37.454
<i>- Gonna frisk you,</i>
<i>everywhere.</i>

47:37.521 --> 47:38.455
[electric buzzing]
