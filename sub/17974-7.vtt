How do I look?

00:49.583 --> 00:52.151
Ugh, Robert?
He's the worst.

00:52.153 --> 00:55.154
No job, no family,
does whatever he wants.

00:55.156 --> 00:56.855

01:02.997 --> 01:06.065
Dah!
Did you feel that?
I didn't.

01:06.067 --> 01:07.399

my ali-money.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.001

Stop fighting over me!

01:17.111 --> 01:19.178

01:24.051 --> 01:25.784
I don't have to listen to this.

01:25.786 --> 01:27.419
Come on, Roberta.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.521
I'm taking you out

01:29.523 --> 01:31.590

No.

Cleveland, you and Robert
fighting has got to stop.

01:38.532 --> 01:41.366
Maybe you can invite him
to your dad's birthday party.

01:41.368 --> 01:42.367
Okay.

01:42.369 --> 01:43.969
Really? That's it?

01:43.971 --> 01:46.138
You'll just do it?
Sure.

01:46.140 --> 01:47.573
You're gonna wear me
down eventually.

01:47.575 --> 01:49.875
I might as well

02:25.845 --> 02:27.846
By the way, nice costume.

02:27.848 --> 02:29.581

Hair from the drain.

Nothing.
Junior broke your recorder!

03:10.224 --> 03:11.690
BOTH:
We're sorry.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.392
You know I'm supposed to play
the opening

Mistubishi dealership

03:15.563 --> 03:17.229

03:17.231 --> 03:19.231
How am I supposed
to do that now?

03:19.233 --> 03:21.667
Why don't you use
one of your other recorders?

03:21.669 --> 03:23.135
Do you hear yourself?

03:23.137 --> 03:25.003
Do you think Yo-Yo Ma
would just play

03:25.005 --> 03:27.706

03:27.708 --> 03:29.308
Probably. If he had to.

03:29.310 --> 03:31.243
Well, I am not Yo-Yo Ma!

03:31.245 --> 03:32.878
I'm Yo-Mama!

03:32.880 --> 03:35.847
And you best bring me
a new one by Saturday.

03:35.849 --> 03:37.649
We don't have $1,100!

03:37.651 --> 03:40.252
Then I suggest you do what
nine percent of Americans

03:40.254 --> 03:44.289

(clears throat)

04:04.178 --> 04:06.578

Hey, bitch, show us your jugs!

04:08.015 --> 04:10.515

04:10.517 --> 04:12.284
Easy, cheap laugh.

04:12.286 --> 04:17.222

I have embroidered a tapestry

And it's my gift to you.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.363
Happy birthday.

04:24.365 --> 04:28.367
Wow, you actually made a quilt
gayer than the AIDS Quilt.

04:28.369 --> 04:29.801
Hey, here's
my gift, Freight.

04:29.803 --> 04:33.238

for months.

04:40.314 --> 04:42.214
How'd you get these?

04:42.216 --> 04:44.383
I pretended to
be a Make-a-Wish
kid named Gerald.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.385
(chuckles)
Classic hustle.

04:46.387 --> 04:48.253
All right,
let's get to Vegas.

04:48.255 --> 04:50.222
But you can't go tonight!

04:50.224 --> 04:52.457
You haven't even tried
to blow out the trick candles

04:52.459 --> 04:55.227
I got you-- (clears throat)
I mean, regular candles.

04:55.229 --> 04:56.795
One blow should do it.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.231
Let's blow this place.

05:04.437 --> 05:08.106
I'll just save these
for next year.

05:08.108 --> 05:11.443
Don't worry.
I'm peeing, I'm peeing.

05:11.445 --> 05:14.212
Donna, stand in
front of me.

05:14.681 --> 05:16.648
Ah...

05:16.650 --> 05:20.452
How are we gonna come up
with $1,100 by Saturday?

05:20.454 --> 05:22.988
Well, you <i>are</i> on
a street corner.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.857
Hot dog stand?
Kinda.

05:27.193 --> 05:29.294
Rallo, check this out!
Let me see that.

05:29.296 --> 05:31.296
Hmm, that's a capital "L."

05:31.298 --> 05:34.533
La, la, low... loo-loo...

05:34.535 --> 05:36.168
That's a "S."

05:36.170 --> 05:38.303
Looks like a snake,
goes like sss...

05:38.305 --> 05:41.940
Los... tee-tee.

05:41.942 --> 05:44.276
Loosst.

05:44.278 --> 05:45.777
Lost. Lost!

05:45.779 --> 05:47.879
"D." D...

05:47.881 --> 05:50.515
It says "Lost Dog."
I wanted to do it!

05:50.517 --> 05:52.117
And they're offering
a $50 reward!

05:52.119 --> 05:53.385
There's a bunch of 'em.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.823
Grab as many as you can, Junior.

05:57.825 --> 05:59.558
That's how we're gonna get
Mama's money.

05:59.560 --> 06:02.327
We'll be dog bounty hunters!

06:02.329 --> 06:04.496
Or we could play bass
in this guy's band.

06:04.498 --> 06:06.631
I don't want
to be in Styx.

06:09.569 --> 06:11.370
(knocking)

06:11.372 --> 06:13.372
Hey, Tubby,
we're back from Vegas.

06:13.374 --> 06:16.408
So, did you have fun
with "Cool Robert"?

06:16.410 --> 06:17.876
Hell, yeah.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.811
Did you know
there's a hepatitis J?

06:19.813 --> 06:21.713
(chuckles)
Vegas is crazy.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.048
(laughs)
Oh, I know.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.650
I went to the M&M Store once.

06:25.652 --> 06:27.519
Yeah, we got real crazy.

06:27.521 --> 06:30.856
So crazy that we decided
to make him and me official.

06:30.858 --> 06:32.057
You got married?

06:32.059 --> 06:33.859
What? Hell no.

06:33.861 --> 06:35.260
That would be ridiculous.

06:35.262 --> 06:37.229
I adopted him.

06:37.231 --> 06:39.264
He's my son now.
What?!

06:39.266 --> 06:41.500
I've always wanted a son
I could point to and say,

06:41.502 --> 06:43.935
"See that man over there
in the tracksuit?

06:43.937 --> 06:47.406
"That's my son,
my boy, my spawn.

06:47.408 --> 06:50.175
No one wears a tracksuit
like my son."

06:50.177 --> 06:52.444
You've never seen
me in my romper.

06:52.446 --> 06:53.879
I'll go get it.

06:53.881 --> 06:56.047
(sighs)
Come on, cool son.

06:56.049 --> 06:58.283
Let's go rustle up
a few hustles.

06:58.285 --> 07:00.085
Uh, Donna, get my back snaps?

07:00.087 --> 07:02.421
They're gone, Cleveland.

07:02.423 --> 07:03.622
My bottom's cold.

07:03.624 --> 07:05.190
(groans)

07:10.797 --> 07:12.264
Dad, good news.

07:12.266 --> 07:14.599
I was able to resew
the tapestry

07:14.601 --> 07:18.570
into what I must admit
is a smart messenger bag.

07:18.572 --> 07:20.772
(groans)
'Sup, Doughbro?

07:20.774 --> 07:22.874
Papa Freight Train, we
playing poker or what?

07:22.876 --> 07:25.377
Poker? Deal me in.

07:25.379 --> 07:26.978
Oh, I almost forgot.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.980
I hus-tul-ed today.

07:28.982 --> 07:31.817
I asked for a water
at a fast-food restaurant

07:31.819 --> 07:33.885
and I filled it with lemonade,

07:33.887 --> 07:35.620
got caught, apologized,

07:35.622 --> 07:37.989
now I can't go back to Chipodle.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.791
I'm out.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.793
It's kind of late;
you've had a few.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.628
Why don't you just crash
in the guest room?

07:43.630 --> 07:44.930
Gracio, Pop.

07:44.932 --> 07:46.798
You don't have
a guest room.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.834
Yeah, we do,
the one with the race car bed

07:48.836 --> 07:50.068
and the plastic sheets.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.937
That sounds like my bed.

07:51.939 --> 07:54.105
I lost my virginity in that bed.

07:54.107 --> 07:56.675
My masturbational virginity.

07:56.677 --> 07:58.743
In a moment
of fumble-handed confusion

07:58.745 --> 08:02.581
while playing my Atari 2600.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.783
Don't touch
my <i>Laverne & Shirley</i> puzzle!

08:04.785 --> 08:06.985
I've been working on it
for 36 years.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.520
You shouldn't be
in here at all.

08:08.522 --> 08:09.921
Dad said I could
stay here.

08:09.923 --> 08:11.089
There's only room

08:11.091 --> 08:12.991
for one son
in this family.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.160
Yeah, well then, bye-bye.

08:17.697 --> 08:19.531
Falc you! Pew!

08:19.533 --> 08:21.199
Pew! Pew!

08:21.201 --> 08:22.267
Pew!

08:23.503 --> 08:26.571
(in slow motion)
No...!

08:35.448 --> 08:37.883
98 pieces.

08:37.885 --> 08:40.519
I'll be dead before I finish it.

08:40.521 --> 08:41.853
(screams)

08:42.955 --> 08:44.623
Who got puzzle
all over this floor?

08:44.625 --> 08:45.790
He did.

08:45.792 --> 08:47.526
It was justified.

08:47.528 --> 08:50.328
He was shooting me with little
Millennium Falcon disceses.

08:50.330 --> 08:52.030
That's an outside toy!

08:52.032 --> 08:53.732
Now both of you, go to bed.

08:53.734 --> 08:54.733
BOTH:
But, Dad...

08:54.735 --> 08:55.867
No buts!

08:55.869 --> 08:57.135
Butts are what I'm gonna kick

08:57.137 --> 08:59.971
if you two punks
don't straighten out.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.072
See what you did?

09:01.074 --> 09:03.041
You did.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.242
He's right.

09:04.244 --> 09:05.877
It's an outside toy

09:05.879 --> 09:07.045
and a choking hazard.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.080
And that puzzle did look hard.

09:09.082 --> 09:10.982
BOTH:
Man, I could use a drink.

09:10.984 --> 09:13.218
I know where my dad keeps
his schnapps.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.653
What about gin?

09:14.655 --> 09:17.055
Nah, gin makes me cry.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.925
(whispering):
Quiet, you'll wake up Dad.

09:19.927 --> 09:21.893
What's he use
this room for?

09:21.895 --> 09:25.730
He writes mystery novels under
the name Jocelyn Elderwood.

09:27.767 --> 09:29.834
(giggling)

09:34.507 --> 09:37.375
I'm going to tell you
a secret right now

09:37.377 --> 09:39.511
that I've never
told anybody.

09:39.513 --> 09:41.079
(clears throat)

09:41.081 --> 09:43.782
I've never danced
for my father.

09:43.784 --> 09:45.350
Also, he hates me.

09:45.352 --> 09:46.785
Teach me.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.587
Teach me how to
impress my dad.

09:48.589 --> 09:49.921
How to hus-tul.

09:49.923 --> 09:50.956
You mean, "hustle"?

09:50.958 --> 09:52.691
No, "hus-tul."

09:52.693 --> 09:54.793
There's a "T."
You're missing the "T."

09:54.795 --> 09:57.395
That's the problem with you;
you play by the rules.

09:57.397 --> 10:00.732
The only rule of hustling is
there are no rules.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.767
Then how do you know
whose turn it is?

10:02.769 --> 10:05.904
(sighs)
You've got a lot
to learn, little bro.

10:05.906 --> 10:07.305
As long as it's
not reading

10:07.307 --> 10:09.975
or writing cursive,
I'm your man.

10:09.977 --> 10:11.710
(barking)

10:11.712 --> 10:13.311
I heard you
found my dog.

10:13.313 --> 10:14.713
Which one is it?

10:14.715 --> 10:15.680
Bark. Bark.

10:18.117 --> 10:19.417
Where's our 40 bucks?

10:19.419 --> 10:20.986
You didn't read
the flier closely.

10:20.988 --> 10:22.754
It said,
"40 barks."

10:22.756 --> 10:24.322
Here you go.

10:24.324 --> 10:25.991
BOTH:
Bark, bark, bark,

10:25.993 --> 10:29.160
bark, bark, bark...

10:29.162 --> 10:30.729
Ah, forget it.

10:30.731 --> 10:33.398
We'll never make enough
by Saturday.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.800
Junior, check this out.

10:37.169 --> 10:38.770
(cash register dings)

10:38.772 --> 10:40.572
5,000 bucks!

10:40.574 --> 10:42.841
This is our way out, Junior.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.743
Beat it, poor people's dogs.

10:44.745 --> 10:47.012
We're moving up
to a better clientele.

10:47.014 --> 10:48.780
Don't I know you?

10:48.782 --> 10:50.181
I know, I know.

10:50.183 --> 10:52.917
I get that a lot,
but I'm not him.

10:55.788 --> 10:56.988
(train horn blowing in distance)

10:56.990 --> 10:58.823
(beeping)

11:01.861 --> 11:03.461
Cool, a forklift!

11:03.463 --> 11:04.963
What is this place?

11:04.965 --> 11:07.198
This is Hustle House.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.501
Or should I say,
your classroom.

11:09.503 --> 11:12.671
Over here, we've got 600 boxes
of hollowed-out soap.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.339
Perfect hustle.

11:14.341 --> 11:17.108
It runs out after two days,
and by then, you're long gone.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.543
(laughs)

11:18.545 --> 11:20.845
I'd kill to get in
on that hustle.

11:20.847 --> 11:24.149
Over there, you got your
weenie pills, enlargers, pumps,

11:24.151 --> 11:26.117
your various
penile miscellany.

11:26.119 --> 11:27.352
All right, Cleveland,

11:27.354 --> 11:30.188
first, I'm putting you
on quality control.

11:31.857 --> 11:33.058
We're gonna watch this bootleg

11:33.060 --> 11:34.959
Chinese version of <i>The Hangover.</i>

11:36.028 --> 11:38.163
I am typical
fat and lazy American

11:38.165 --> 11:40.999
who have no chance of surviving
when China take over!

11:41.001 --> 11:42.300
(both laugh)

11:42.302 --> 11:44.569
A bologna suit.

11:44.571 --> 11:47.172
Why do we wait so long
to do the things

11:47.174 --> 11:48.673
we know will make us happy?

11:48.675 --> 11:50.241
Now, here's what
we're gonna do.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.310
We're gonna roll you down
this hill, and then...

11:52.312 --> 11:54.379
(dogs snarling,
Cleveland Jr. screaming)

11:57.049 --> 11:58.249
Oh, my God!

11:58.251 --> 11:59.350
Rock Hudson!

11:59.352 --> 12:01.219
We're rich!

12:01.221 --> 12:02.053
(laughs)

12:02.055 --> 12:03.421
Stop that. Stop that.

12:03.423 --> 12:04.989
Why are you licking me?

12:04.991 --> 12:07.392
Ah, you must like me
more than bologna.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.227
(chuckles)

12:09.229 --> 12:11.362
But I don't care
how cute you are,

12:11.364 --> 12:14.899
you're nothing
but a dollar sign to me.

12:17.103 --> 12:19.270
All right, I love you.

12:19.272 --> 12:21.072
(screaming)

12:21.074 --> 12:23.007
Hey, you found Rock Hudson!

12:23.009 --> 12:25.009
(screaming)

12:25.011 --> 12:27.078
(giggling):
Ooh...

12:31.250 --> 12:34.018
That's badass.

12:34.020 --> 12:35.520
I've always wanted to look like

12:35.522 --> 12:39.023
an Italian or Armenian
or Arab guy.

12:39.025 --> 12:40.024
Or black guy.

12:40.026 --> 12:41.226
Or black guy.

12:41.228 --> 12:42.861
ROBERT (ringtone):
Yo, you got a call.

12:42.863 --> 12:44.229
What up?

12:44.231 --> 12:46.197
Whoa, that is a big hustle.

12:46.199 --> 12:47.732
But I'm tied up all week.

12:47.734 --> 12:49.134
Ooh! Pick me!

12:49.136 --> 12:50.635
I'll get back to you.

12:50.637 --> 12:52.270
What am I gonna do?

12:52.272 --> 12:55.140
I need someone I can
trust, like... a brother.

12:55.142 --> 12:56.741
Uh, Robert.

12:56.743 --> 12:57.809
I don't know, man.

12:57.811 --> 12:59.444
This is the
big leagues.

12:59.446 --> 13:02.113
We're talking a three,
possibly four-figure deal.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.816
No way!

13:04.818 --> 13:07.152
Come on, let me be
a legitimate hustler like you

13:07.154 --> 13:08.987
so my dad loves me.

13:08.989 --> 13:11.256
You really want to dance
for your father, don't you?

13:11.258 --> 13:12.390
(sighs)

13:12.392 --> 13:14.058
A'ight, go to our
satellite office

13:14.060 --> 13:16.327
in the back of the old
gun shop in Pittsburgh.

13:16.329 --> 13:18.329
Everything you need
to know is in here.

13:18.331 --> 13:20.632
I won't let you down, bro.

13:20.634 --> 13:23.401
I trust these instructions
aren't in cursive?

13:23.403 --> 13:27.071
You are hustling
your brother, no?

13:27.073 --> 13:29.340
Yes. Yes, I am.

13:29.342 --> 13:31.509
And this is just the beginning.

13:31.511 --> 13:34.579
(laughing maniacally)

13:42.988 --> 13:45.123
Tubby, what are you doing
bothering me-- whoa.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.524
That's a nice
tracksuit.

13:46.526 --> 13:47.926
Oh, this new
highly flammable thing?

13:47.928 --> 13:49.694
Just hitting the road.
(knuckles crack)

13:49.696 --> 13:51.129
Got my hustles.

13:51.131 --> 13:53.932
Hmm. When you get back,
I want to hear about them.

13:53.934 --> 13:57.001
I'd... I'd like that.

13:57.003 --> 13:58.770
May I dance for you?

13:58.772 --> 14:00.705
Not yet.

14:01.807 --> 14:03.007
Oh, hey, Junior.

14:03.009 --> 14:04.709
I was gonna ask
you something.

14:04.711 --> 14:05.944
What was it?

14:05.946 --> 14:07.145
Oh, yeah.

14:07.147 --> 14:08.513
Where the hell's
my money?!

14:08.515 --> 14:10.014
You said I had
till Saturday.

14:10.016 --> 14:12.617
Is that what I said, Larry?

14:12.619 --> 14:14.619
W-Why do you have Larry?

14:14.621 --> 14:17.322
We were just talking about
how disappointed I would be

14:17.324 --> 14:19.023
if I didn't get to
perform on Saturday

14:19.025 --> 14:20.859
at that new
car dealership.

14:20.861 --> 14:23.394
Miss Donna, we're on the verge
of a big score...

14:23.396 --> 14:24.896
Don't verge me!

14:24.898 --> 14:27.065
I need that
recorder, Junior!

14:27.067 --> 14:29.868
My ducats is due!

14:29.870 --> 14:31.936
(laughs)

14:34.039 --> 14:35.273
(sighs)

14:37.877 --> 14:40.912
Cleveland Brown,
badass hustler.

14:40.914 --> 14:43.147
Give me some skin.

14:43.149 --> 14:44.916
Where's your Purell?

14:44.918 --> 14:47.085
Now, you're gonna be delivering
phony autographed head shots

14:47.087 --> 14:50.255
for display in dry cleaners
across the country.

14:51.357 --> 14:53.524
(whistles)

14:53.526 --> 14:57.262
Erin Gray.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.100
Hey, Robert.

15:02.102 --> 15:03.668
I'm done with my hustles.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.603
ROBERT: You went to
30 dry cleaners already?

15:05.605 --> 15:07.605
I thought that would
take you all week.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.574
I hustled.
(laughs)

15:09.576 --> 15:12.010
All right, I'll think of
some more and get back at you.

15:12.012 --> 15:13.411
Okay! Bye!

15:16.749 --> 15:18.249
Okay, nice work.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.784
Thanks for your help.

15:19.786 --> 15:22.020
I have no idea how
anyone would know

15:22.022 --> 15:24.188
where to go, but
you're welcome.

15:24.190 --> 15:28.126
Hey, brother, I'm done here,
so I'm heading back.

15:28.128 --> 15:30.762
Also, I can't poop
anywhere but home;

15:30.764 --> 15:33.031
I'm about eight pounds
over where I was.

15:33.033 --> 15:35.400
ROBERT: Hold up, I got
something else for you.

15:35.402 --> 15:38.703
Kim Kardashian wore a goose coat
at the Fat Armenian Awards.

15:38.705 --> 15:40.471
Now everybody
wants a goose coat.

15:40.473 --> 15:43.574
So, you're heading up north
to Canada to pick up 400 geese.

15:43.576 --> 15:45.043
(sighs)

15:45.045 --> 15:46.210
Canada.

15:46.212 --> 15:47.378
Free health care.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.580
Mm, finally get
this ankle looked at.

15:49.582 --> 15:51.149
(heartbeat thumping)

15:56.588 --> 15:59.257
Rallo! We've got to find that
dog and get our reward

15:59.259 --> 16:01.993
before your mom--
her words, not mine--

16:01.995 --> 16:03.661
"beats the black off me."

16:03.663 --> 16:05.363
Rallo?
(dog whimpers)

16:07.132 --> 16:08.900
(gasps)
My bone!

16:08.902 --> 16:10.969
It's you!

16:14.073 --> 16:16.341
Duck. Duck. Duck. Duck.

16:16.343 --> 16:18.176
Goose!

16:18.178 --> 16:20.178
Of course you're good at this.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.113
You're the inventors
of the game.

16:22.115 --> 16:25.016
That's like playing Chinese
checkers against the Czechs.

16:25.018 --> 16:26.617
What am I doing?

16:26.619 --> 16:30.955
Chasing wild geese,
it's like some wild-goose ch...

16:30.957 --> 16:32.156
Son of a bitch!

16:32.158 --> 16:35.093
Robert!

16:37.096 --> 16:39.364
Okay, one more game.

16:39.366 --> 16:42.166
Duck. Duck. Duck.

16:44.703 --> 16:46.270
Lunchtime, Rock.

16:46.272 --> 16:47.939
Mama hasn't been
to the store yet

16:47.941 --> 16:50.208
so all we got is pigs feet
and baking soda.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.943
Rock Hudson?

16:51.945 --> 16:54.379
Rock Hudson?! Oh, my God!

16:54.381 --> 16:56.280
You looking for that dog?

16:56.282 --> 16:58.516
Junior left with him
about 40 minutes ago.

16:58.518 --> 17:02.120
If you walk slowly, you should
be able to catch up to him.

17:02.122 --> 17:04.188
You're right!

17:08.694 --> 17:10.328
(doorbell rings)

17:10.330 --> 17:11.396
Junior, wait!

17:12.331 --> 17:13.398
Oh, hello.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.967
You must be here
for the pool party.

17:15.969 --> 17:17.668
The ad implied you
would be older.

17:17.670 --> 17:18.703
And thinner.

17:18.705 --> 17:19.871
And whiter.

17:19.873 --> 17:21.639
No, Mr. Waterman, sir.

17:21.641 --> 17:25.143
We found your dog and would
like our $5,000 reward please.

17:25.145 --> 17:26.677
No, we're keeping him!

17:26.679 --> 17:28.246
Actually, he's my wife's dog.

17:28.248 --> 17:30.214
I can't stand
the little bastard.

17:30.216 --> 17:32.050
He barks at all my guests.

17:32.052 --> 17:34.986
The sweaty delivery man
I invited in for a shower.

17:34.988 --> 17:37.321
The sweaty gardener I invited
in for a shower.

17:37.323 --> 17:38.856
The sweaty fireman...

17:38.858 --> 17:40.091
We get it.

17:40.093 --> 17:41.993
I keep leaving
the door open

17:41.995 --> 17:45.329
so he'll run away, but he
keeps finding his way back.

17:45.331 --> 17:47.098
Don't you, you
little rooster-blocker?
(growls)

17:47.100 --> 17:50.701
So, sounds like it might be
worth something to you

17:50.703 --> 17:52.904
if you never saw
this dog again.

17:52.906 --> 17:54.238
Are you extorting me?

17:54.240 --> 17:55.573
I would never...

17:55.575 --> 17:59.210
(barking)

17:59.212 --> 18:00.378
All right, fine!

18:00.380 --> 18:02.780
Here's everything
in my wallet.

18:02.782 --> 18:06.350
$5,000 and a picture of
Pat Sajak at the beach?

18:06.352 --> 18:07.552
I'm keeping this.

18:07.554 --> 18:09.087
I love you,
Rock Hudson.

18:09.089 --> 18:10.955
Don't say that!

18:10.957 --> 18:13.858
You know how many people died
not too long after saying that?

18:13.860 --> 18:15.393
Oh, my God! Larry!

18:15.395 --> 18:17.361
You gonna die, jungle cat!

18:17.363 --> 18:18.429
Wait!

18:18.431 --> 18:20.498
Oh, you made it,
just in time.

18:23.268 --> 18:26.571
(playing "When the Saints
Go Marching In")

18:26.573 --> 18:28.806
Keep your head down
around here, Rock.

18:28.808 --> 18:29.807
Mama crazy.

18:29.809 --> 18:30.808
(barks)

18:30.810 --> 18:32.543
(tires screech)

18:35.247 --> 18:36.914
Cable installer?

18:36.916 --> 18:40.485
But that's my awful job!

18:41.220 --> 18:43.287
(tires screech)

18:43.289 --> 18:45.256
Terry! Who have you been
working with this week?

18:45.258 --> 18:46.257
Robert.

18:46.259 --> 18:47.258
What's his last name?

18:47.260 --> 18:48.259
I don't know.

18:48.261 --> 18:50.128
Oh, my God! That's him!

18:50.130 --> 18:53.064
Guys, has anyone been in here
drinking with you this week?

18:53.066 --> 18:54.298
Yeah, Robert has.

18:54.300 --> 18:57.135
No!
This can't be happening!

18:57.137 --> 18:59.637
Wait, that hasn't been
Cleveland sitting here?

18:59.639 --> 19:02.006
(speaking Japanese)

19:02.008 --> 19:03.608
Yeah. Lobert.

19:03.610 --> 19:06.310
No...!

19:08.614 --> 19:12.483
So, every time the dealership
sold another hatchback,

19:12.485 --> 19:15.119
obviously, I played this.

19:15.121 --> 19:16.988
(playing "The Farmer
in the Dell")

19:20.926 --> 19:22.827
There you are, brother!

19:22.829 --> 19:24.529
I thought I might
find you here...

19:24.531 --> 19:25.997
Oh, cute dog.

19:25.999 --> 19:27.331
You tricked me!

19:27.333 --> 19:28.966
You're trying
to steal my life!

19:28.968 --> 19:30.434
Cleveland, what are
you talking about?

19:30.436 --> 19:31.536
He hustled me!

19:31.538 --> 19:33.137
You hustled yourself.

19:33.139 --> 19:35.339
But more accurately,
I hustled you.

19:35.341 --> 19:36.340
But why?

19:36.342 --> 19:37.542
Look at your life, fool.

19:37.544 --> 19:38.643
You have everything.

19:38.645 --> 19:39.944
You always did.

19:39.946 --> 19:42.013
You had the coolest dad in town.

19:42.015 --> 19:43.481
The baddest mom.

19:43.483 --> 19:45.316
You had a damn
Millennium Falcon.

19:45.318 --> 19:47.518
You think I had a Millennium
Falcon growing up?

19:47.520 --> 19:49.520
You don't think I wanted
to run around going,

19:49.522 --> 19:51.455
"Pew! Pew! Pew!"

19:51.457 --> 19:54.792
All I had was an old pair of
pants I found in the woods.

19:54.794 --> 19:55.793
Corduroy?

19:55.795 --> 19:57.161
And look at your ass today--

19:57.163 --> 19:59.397
dinner on the table,
laundry done,

19:59.399 --> 20:01.799
drinking every night
and coming home to have sex

20:01.801 --> 20:04.068
with a woman you ain't
even got to hold down.

20:04.070 --> 20:05.870
This is the real Hustle House.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.872
And you're the real hustler.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.073
Wait a minute, Robert.

20:09.075 --> 20:10.575
You hustled your own brother?

20:10.577 --> 20:12.410
You don't hustle family.

20:12.412 --> 20:14.212
I'm disappointed in you, son.

20:14.214 --> 20:15.846
But, Dad...
Don't you sass me.

20:15.848 --> 20:17.348
Get over here!

20:17.350 --> 20:18.382
(grunting)

20:18.384 --> 20:19.550
No! No!

20:19.552 --> 20:21.319
I'm sorry, Dad! I'm sorry!

20:21.321 --> 20:23.387
(crying):
Oh...

20:23.389 --> 20:24.655
Oh, it hurts!

20:24.657 --> 20:26.591
(crying)

20:26.593 --> 20:28.526
Ha, ha! Ha, ha!

20:28.528 --> 20:30.595
And he went in
your liquor cabinet.

20:30.597 --> 20:32.063
I got it made.

20:32.065 --> 20:34.498
I'm the coolest hustler
in this town.

20:34.500 --> 20:37.268
You heard Robert
say so himself, Dad.

20:37.270 --> 20:40.438
So, I guess I finally
earned your respect.

20:40.440 --> 20:42.106
I'm not saying
you earned my respect,

20:42.108 --> 20:44.442
but you may dance for me.

20:44.444 --> 20:45.843
(crying)

20:45.845 --> 20:47.578
(playing "Private Dancer")

20:47.580 --> 20:50.514
Oh, it hurts!

20:52.417 --> 20:54.485
CLEVELAND:
<i>I would never dance</i>
<i>for my father again.</i>
