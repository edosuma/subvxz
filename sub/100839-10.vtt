WEBVTT

00:10.343 --> 00:12.303
[Perez] You want to confess something?

00:13.013 --> 00:14.806
Wait, how do you even know where I live?

00:15.515 --> 00:20.061
I dropped Judy off here one night
when she was-- was...

00:20.645 --> 00:21.646
Didn't, um...

00:22.022 --> 00:25.233
-This is about something else.
-Okay. [sobs]

00:25.316 --> 00:28.194
Oh. Oh, God. Oh, God.
What's happening here? Um...

00:29.612 --> 00:30.697
You-- you okay?

00:31.656 --> 00:34.617
I'm sorry. This isn't professional.
[sighs]

00:34.701 --> 00:37.537
No, no, it's fine, you're fine.
It's-- it's, uh...

00:38.496 --> 00:40.457
Hmm. Why you crying?

00:40.540 --> 00:41.708
[blubbers]

00:41.791 --> 00:43.543
-I don't want to get into it.
-Okay.

00:43.626 --> 00:45.795
-Michelle left.
-Oh.

00:46.212 --> 00:49.841
-She moved out.
-Oh. Wow. I'm so sorry.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.218
Bad timing on my part.

00:52.302 --> 00:53.470
I mean, yeah, okay,

00:53.553 --> 00:59.976
I guess I maybe was just holding out hope
that we would get back together.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.227
Oh, yeah.

01:01.311 --> 01:04.731
But no, she just thinks that I lost myself
in my job,

01:04.814 --> 01:07.150
that I always see the worst in people.

01:07.233 --> 01:09.652
Oh, I'm sure that's not the case.

01:09.736 --> 01:12.363
Do you think I want to be a cop
all the time?

01:12.447 --> 01:15.200
You think I like being the person
people are afraid of?

01:15.617 --> 01:19.829
"Oh, let's not invite her to game night.
She'll arrest us all for smoking pot."

01:20.872 --> 01:22.165
That's not even illegal anymore.

01:22.248 --> 01:23.792
Okay, well, it's a bad example,

01:23.875 --> 01:28.004
but it's really hard to "turn it off" when
you're dealing with criminals all day.

01:28.630 --> 01:29.464
Right.

01:30.006 --> 01:31.216
I'm sorry.

01:31.299 --> 01:32.967
No, it's-- it's okay.

01:33.384 --> 01:35.553
-I'm sorry. [sighs]
-Take your time.

01:36.429 --> 01:37.305
[exhales]

01:38.098 --> 01:39.724
Yeah. Yeah, sorry.

01:40.391 --> 01:41.810
[sighs] Okay.

01:43.394 --> 01:46.231
Okay. [exhales]

01:47.690 --> 01:48.817
What did you want to say?

01:50.110 --> 01:53.321
-I killed Steve Wood.
-Oh, Jesus Joseph Christ.

01:55.615 --> 01:57.033
[Jen sighs] <i>"I don't know where to begin.</i>

01:57.117 --> 01:59.410
<i>I just know this has to end.</i>

01:59.619 --> 02:01.955
<i>I know you think you're the reason</i>
<i>all our problems started,</i>

02:02.038 --> 02:04.874
<i>but they existed long before we met,</i>

02:05.250 --> 02:06.668
<i>and I'm so glad that we met.</i>

02:07.293 --> 02:11.464
<i>You are the best friend I've ever known,</i>
<i>the best person I've ever known.</i>

02:12.006 --> 02:15.218
<i>You're a better mother to Charlie</i>
<i>and Henry than I could ever be.</i>

02:15.677 --> 02:17.637
<i>I know that they may not be</i>
<i>the kids you dreamed of,</i>

02:17.720 --> 02:20.181
<i>but I'm hoping you'll find it</i>
<i>in your enormous heart</i>

02:20.265 --> 02:22.976
<i>to take care of them</i>
<i>and be their legal guardian.</i>

02:24.519 --> 02:26.271
<i>I'm so sorry I lied to you.</i>

02:26.980 --> 02:28.273
<i>I'm sorry I betrayed you.</i>

02:29.023 --> 02:31.442
<i>I'm sorry I couldn't</i>
<i>forgive you sooner for Ted.</i>

02:31.901 --> 02:34.779
<i>But no matter what you think,</i>
<i>you've paid the price.</i>

02:35.488 --> 02:36.823
<i>Now I need to do the same."</i>

02:43.538 --> 02:44.581
[Jen] This seems right.

02:46.416 --> 02:47.375
How much farther?

02:47.458 --> 02:51.462
Um, I think we're close.
Okay. All right. It's this way.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.632
-[gasps]
-[woman] Morning.

02:54.716 --> 02:56.050
-[Jen] Good morning.
-[Perez] Hey.

02:56.509 --> 02:57.594
Beautiful day, huh?

02:57.677 --> 02:58.803
-Yeah.
-It's great.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.430
Come on, Daisy.

03:00.805 --> 03:02.682
-Have a good one.
-[Jen] Thanks.

03:02.765 --> 03:04.017
-Okay.
-Wait, wait, wait.

03:04.517 --> 03:06.060
-Walk me through this again.
-Okay.

03:06.144 --> 03:08.980
-Mr. Wood showed up at your house, angry.
-Yeah. Very.

03:09.147 --> 03:11.816
And I asked him to leave, and he wouldn't.

03:11.900 --> 03:14.319
You know, my kids were upstairs.
I was worried that he would...

03:14.861 --> 03:17.238
Anyway, he said some things
that really upset me,

03:17.322 --> 03:20.450
and I don't know, but something
inside me just took over,

03:20.533 --> 03:21.534
and the next thing I know,

03:22.202 --> 03:23.119
he was...

03:23.453 --> 03:27.040
If I was married to you, I'd want
to kill myself too you miserable cunt.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.751
<i>-</i>[grunts]
-[Judy] <i>What did you do?</i>

03:29.834 --> 03:30.835
[pants]

03:31.586 --> 03:32.462
[Perez] Dead?

03:33.046 --> 03:33.880
Yeah.

03:34.339 --> 03:36.257
Why'd he show up at your house
in the first place?

03:37.300 --> 03:38.718
He was looking for Judy.

03:43.097 --> 03:45.099
[humming]

03:53.149 --> 03:53.983
[Henry] Hey, good morning.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.026
[Judy] Hi!

03:55.235 --> 03:56.527
Oh, nice, you made pancakes?

03:56.611 --> 03:59.989
Sure did! With some chocolate chip action,
your favorite.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.241
Aww, thank you.

04:02.909 --> 04:04.035
Is Mom coming down?

04:05.411 --> 04:07.413
Um, she's not here.

04:07.705 --> 04:08.539
Where is she?

04:08.915 --> 04:10.291
[Charlie] She probably went for a run.

04:10.959 --> 04:12.710
Yeah, she probably did.

04:13.503 --> 04:14.379
Who's hungry?

04:14.629 --> 04:15.463
[Henry] Oh, I am.

04:16.256 --> 04:19.175
There you go. Well, you better dig in.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.927
Get all up in there
while they're still hot.

04:21.386 --> 04:22.470
Aren't you gonna have some?

04:23.513 --> 04:24.430
Yeah.

04:24.514 --> 04:25.348
[Henry] Cool.

04:27.558 --> 04:28.518
I'll be right back.

04:37.568 --> 04:38.403
Judy, hey!

04:38.486 --> 04:39.862
Hey, hey, Karen!

04:39.946 --> 04:41.572
-Getting an a.m. jog in?
-I sure am.

04:41.656 --> 04:42.490
-Me too!
-Yeah.

04:42.573 --> 04:43.616
Not sure if you heard,

04:43.700 --> 04:46.744
-but Jeff and I are separating.
-Yeah, I did, I'm sorry about that.

04:46.828 --> 04:49.622
Yeah, working on my revenge bod
before I hit the dating apps.

04:49.706 --> 04:50.832
Forget that, you look great.

04:50.915 --> 04:52.208
-Oh, thanks.
-Sure.

04:52.292 --> 04:55.211
Hey, if you ever want a run buddy,
we can get a little Google Cal--

04:55.586 --> 04:57.046
Okay, no worries.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.882
You got your own flow going.
I totally respect that.

04:59.966 --> 05:00.967
[Judy panting]

05:01.092 --> 05:02.385
It was fun catching up!

05:03.136 --> 05:04.345
[Perez] Wait, slow down.

05:04.429 --> 05:07.640
You're telling me you dragged his body
through these woods with no help?

05:07.724 --> 05:09.475
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I was a dancer.

05:09.767 --> 05:11.352
-Very strong core.
-Yeah, right.

05:11.436 --> 05:12.520
Okay, look.

05:12.603 --> 05:15.189
I know you have a photo of Charlie
driving Steve's car.

05:15.648 --> 05:18.234
Okay, but he got the car from my storage.

05:18.318 --> 05:21.988
He is a teenager
with an underdeveloped frontal lobe,

05:22.071 --> 05:24.532
and he saw something he wanted,
and he took it.

05:24.615 --> 05:25.616
He's an idiot.

05:26.701 --> 05:27.910
But he is not a killer.

05:31.289 --> 05:32.332
All right, you know what?

05:32.415 --> 05:35.126
Yeah, this is looking very familiar to me.

05:35.209 --> 05:37.128
That's because we've just circled back
to where we were.

05:37.211 --> 05:39.172
Wait, wait. We did? Are you sure?

05:39.255 --> 05:40.548
No. Are you?

05:40.631 --> 05:42.091
[sighs] No.

05:42.508 --> 05:45.136
[stuttering] I-- I know
he's around here somewhere, okay? I...

05:45.345 --> 05:46.262
Oh, wait, is that...

05:46.596 --> 05:48.097
No. Damn.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.557
Oh, come on,
we've been at this long enough.

05:49.640 --> 05:51.976
We're going back to the car
before <i>our</i> bodies are never found.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.853
Oh, Perez, wait!

05:55.146 --> 05:57.398
[coughs] Oh, hey.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.901
Where's my mom?
I know she didn't come home last night.

06:00.610 --> 06:01.527
Is she okay?

06:01.611 --> 06:02.445
Yeah.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.697
-No, um...
-Judy.

06:04.781 --> 06:05.782
-I don't know.
-Judy.

06:05.865 --> 06:07.116
Please tell me the truth.

06:07.575 --> 06:09.035
Is-- is she in danger?

06:09.494 --> 06:11.454
-What are you talking about?
-I don't know.

06:11.871 --> 06:14.290
She told me Steve was involved
with some dangerous people,

06:14.374 --> 06:16.376
and I found this in his car.

06:16.542 --> 06:18.252
I was too scared to give it to her.

06:18.336 --> 06:19.462
What is this?

06:19.712 --> 06:21.255
I don't know.
There's a bunch of shit in there.

06:25.885 --> 06:27.678
I tried to read what was
on the thumb drive,

06:27.762 --> 06:29.514
but it's all in some weird language,

06:29.597 --> 06:31.516
-like Hebrew or...
-Greek?

06:32.683 --> 06:33.601
Okay.

06:35.520 --> 06:36.354
Okay.

06:37.230 --> 06:40.066
Thank you for giving this to me.

06:40.149 --> 06:42.402
It was a very responsible thing to do.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.487
I'm super proud of you.

06:46.030 --> 06:47.657
Please, just give me
20 more minutes, okay?

06:47.740 --> 06:48.991
-An hour, tops.
-No.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.661
Just-- I can find him, please.

06:52.578 --> 06:53.538
[sighs]

06:53.830 --> 06:56.541
Charlie had nothing to do with this, okay?

06:58.501 --> 06:59.627
What about Judy Hale?

06:59.710 --> 07:01.254
She have something to do with it?

07:01.754 --> 07:04.257
I'm assuming she's the one who told you
we had the picture of Charlie.

07:04.799 --> 07:06.759
Did she blackmail you to say
that you did it alone?

07:06.843 --> 07:08.094
-She write you another check?
-What?

07:08.428 --> 07:10.012
No, no.

07:10.096 --> 07:14.308
Judy's broke, and she would never.
She's a fucking angel on Earth.

07:14.809 --> 07:18.604
I did this. Alone.
Judy is completely innocent.

07:19.522 --> 07:22.191
[scoffs]
God, what the hell is it about that woman?

07:22.275 --> 07:23.151
What?

07:23.234 --> 07:26.237
It's like she puts a spell
on every goddamn person she meets.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.823
She told you she ran over your husband,

07:28.906 --> 07:31.659
and yet you somehow still seem to think
that she's some goddamn peach.

07:31.742 --> 07:34.120
Please explain to me how that is possible,

07:34.203 --> 07:36.205
because from where I'm sitting,
none of it makes sense.

07:36.289 --> 07:39.083
Okay, I know how it sounds, all right?

07:39.959 --> 07:44.338
I wanted to hate Judy. I really did.
But it's impossible.

07:44.422 --> 07:46.507
It's like hating a baby or something.

07:46.591 --> 07:47.508
You just can't.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.177
-Why?
-I don't know. It just...

07:51.971 --> 07:53.264
She sees the good in people.

07:54.765 --> 07:56.017
Even when it isn't there.

08:02.773 --> 08:05.401
[engine turns over]

08:14.285 --> 08:15.119
Hey.

08:15.203 --> 08:16.037
Hey--

08:16.621 --> 08:18.956
Hi. I have some information
on the Steve Wood case.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.209
-You know, the tip line's anonymous.
-Yeah, I heard about that.

08:22.793 --> 08:24.045
But I want you to promise me,

08:24.128 --> 08:26.714
if I give this to you, you're gonna do
everything you can to help Jen.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.299
Help Jen with what?

08:28.382 --> 08:29.217
Help her...

08:29.509 --> 08:31.385
-Wait, did she not come in here?
-No.

08:31.469 --> 08:32.678
-What?
-Why does she need my help?

08:33.262 --> 08:34.138
I meant, like,

08:34.222 --> 08:37.767
just in case she ever finds herself
in a position where she needs help,

08:38.100 --> 08:41.479
I want to help make sure
that you help her.

08:41.979 --> 08:43.231
Okay.

08:46.901 --> 08:47.985
This belongs to Steve.

08:48.778 --> 08:50.279
I happened upon it recently.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.575
You happened upon it?

08:55.409 --> 08:57.411
I don't think he wanted anybody
to find it.

09:01.916 --> 09:02.833
You know,

09:03.793 --> 09:06.337
I heard about those voicemails
that he left you.

09:06.796 --> 09:07.880
-You did?
-Mm-hmm.

09:07.964 --> 09:10.216
-What did you hear?
-Oh, nothing that surprised me.

09:10.675 --> 09:15.137
Though I'm still trying to figure out
why you'd stay with a guy like that.

09:17.306 --> 09:19.016
Yeah,
I'm trying to figure that out myself.

09:20.434 --> 09:22.770
I guess I thought maybe
you get what you deserve.

09:25.022 --> 09:26.732
Nobody deserves that.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.069
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

09:32.488 --> 09:35.866
I listened to that recorder thing
to see if it was anything.

09:37.493 --> 09:38.953
Play it somewhere private.

09:39.912 --> 09:42.123
Where the Chief won't be able
to hear himself.

09:43.457 --> 09:44.500
Okay.

09:51.382 --> 09:52.216
Oh, shit.

09:56.804 --> 09:58.347
Oh, shit.

10:06.772 --> 10:07.898
Oh, God.

10:08.649 --> 10:10.484
Oh, God, my kids are awake. [sighs]

10:10.860 --> 10:13.738
Am I allowed to get in--
Can I make a phone call?

10:13.821 --> 10:15.281
-Sure.
-Okay, thanks.

10:17.366 --> 10:19.201
-[beeps]
-Oh, no. Shit.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.371
You'll get better reception
when we're out of the woods.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.623
[Jen sighs]

10:24.707 --> 10:25.875
It doesn't matter.

10:28.085 --> 10:29.086
Like, how am I...

10:30.212 --> 10:32.048
How am I gonna explain this to them?

10:32.590 --> 10:34.884
I mean, I know I have to, but it's like...

10:35.384 --> 10:38.387
They already had such a shitty hand
dealt to them with their dad, and I...

10:39.764 --> 10:40.598
One job...

10:42.016 --> 10:44.602
as their mother, one fucking job,
and I failed.

10:46.646 --> 10:50.066
You said he was threatening you.
You said you asked him to leave.

10:50.149 --> 10:52.318
He has a history of abusive behavior.

10:52.902 --> 10:54.445
That'll carry weight in a courtroom.

10:54.528 --> 10:55.446
[laughs] Yeah, well...

10:56.947 --> 10:59.158
Steve's family has a lot of connections
around town.

10:59.241 --> 11:00.534
Yeah, I'm aware.

11:01.160 --> 11:03.663
I'm pretty confident that... [sniffles]

11:03.954 --> 11:07.083
...nobody's gonna take pity
on the angry woman who attacked him.

11:08.876 --> 11:09.877
You don't know that.

11:11.796 --> 11:14.840
[sobbing] I do know my kids
are gonna lose their mom.

11:17.718 --> 11:22.098
And I know how it fucking destroyed me
when I lost mine. [sniffles]

11:22.515 --> 11:25.893
[Jen inhales, exhales]

11:25.976 --> 11:27.186
When did your mom pass?

11:30.231 --> 11:31.065
Uh...

11:31.941 --> 11:33.109
when I was 19.

11:33.901 --> 11:35.695
From breast cancer. [sniffles]

11:39.115 --> 11:40.950
I lost my mom when I was young, too.

11:44.578 --> 11:45.788
Was she-- was she sick?

11:49.208 --> 11:50.084
She was murdered.

11:50.167 --> 11:51.210
Oh, God.

11:51.836 --> 11:54.046
She was trying to protect me
from my stepfather.

11:54.130 --> 11:55.089
[Jen exhales]

11:57.717 --> 11:59.719
She sounds like a good mom.

12:00.511 --> 12:03.305
-[sniffling]
-She was.

12:04.932 --> 12:06.934
I miss her every day.

12:08.477 --> 12:09.353
Me too.

12:11.313 --> 12:12.440
Every day.

12:14.859 --> 12:17.153
-[cell phone chimes]
-[sniffling continuing]

12:17.236 --> 12:19.613
-Reception's back.
-Oh, okay.

12:20.448 --> 12:24.201
Um, so what happens now?

12:26.412 --> 12:28.414
Um...

12:29.957 --> 12:33.419
[sighs] All right.
Well, we'll, uh, go back to the station.

12:33.502 --> 12:34.336
Okay.

12:34.420 --> 12:37.006
You'll give a statement,
with a lawyer present if you choose,

12:37.089 --> 12:38.632
and you will be formally charged.

12:38.716 --> 12:40.968
[sighs] Okay.

12:42.803 --> 12:43.637
Okay.

12:43.929 --> 12:46.223
-That's standard procedure.
-Right.

12:50.394 --> 12:51.645
But you're gonna go home.

12:53.564 --> 12:54.523
Huh?

12:55.107 --> 12:58.736
And we are never gonna talk about
what we didn't find out here ever again.

12:59.904 --> 13:00.780
What-- what?

13:00.863 --> 13:01.906
We were never here.

13:02.573 --> 13:06.118
Okay, I'm sorry, I don't--
I don't think I understand.

13:08.287 --> 13:09.121
I just...

13:10.998 --> 13:12.625
I don't want to be a cop right now.

13:14.376 --> 13:15.544
I want to be a person.

13:17.546 --> 13:20.549
And sometimes justice just
works itself out.

13:22.384 --> 13:23.594
So go home to your kids.

13:25.221 --> 13:26.347
Tell them you love them.

13:29.099 --> 13:30.851
Because someday
they're gonna miss hearing it.

13:33.062 --> 13:35.022
[sobbing] Oh, my God.

13:38.609 --> 13:39.527
Thank you.

13:43.906 --> 13:44.865
Thank you.

13:53.874 --> 13:56.710
Judy, is my mom still out for a run?

13:58.504 --> 13:59.672
No.

13:59.755 --> 14:02.132
-Oh, I hope she's okay.
-What is that?

14:02.967 --> 14:03.926
Um...

14:06.387 --> 14:07.847
Can you guys sit down for a minute?

14:08.264 --> 14:09.223
Why?

14:09.306 --> 14:12.393
'Cause I want to talk to you
about something that's really important.

14:15.479 --> 14:18.399
Your mom loves you so, so much.

14:19.024 --> 14:20.234
Oh, shit.

14:20.317 --> 14:22.820
And I love you so, so much.

14:24.113 --> 14:25.322
Yeah, we love you, too.

14:25.406 --> 14:26.240
Thanks.

14:27.366 --> 14:28.200
And...

14:29.118 --> 14:31.036
I just want you to know
that no matter what happens,

14:31.120 --> 14:32.955
you guys are gonna be okay.

14:33.497 --> 14:34.456
Okay?

14:34.999 --> 14:35.833
Okay.

14:37.084 --> 14:37.918
Okay.

14:40.504 --> 14:42.256
-Your mom is...
-Hi.

14:43.299 --> 14:45.551
-...coming through the door right now.
-[Charlie] Mom!

14:47.011 --> 14:47.845
Oh, God.

14:48.429 --> 14:51.098
That's not really
the greeting I was expecting.

14:51.181 --> 14:54.351
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I am. I am. Are you?

14:55.978 --> 14:56.812
Yeah.

14:57.187 --> 14:59.440
-Hey, Mommy.
-Hi, baby. Oh, God, I love you.

14:59.523 --> 15:01.191
[sobbing]

15:01.275 --> 15:03.444
-I love you both so much.
-[Henry] We know.

15:03.527 --> 15:05.613
[Jen sniffles] Okay.

15:07.489 --> 15:08.490
[Charlie sighs]

15:09.033 --> 15:10.200
Listen, I, um...

15:10.659 --> 15:13.120
I just want to explain the letters.

15:13.203 --> 15:14.622
Nope. Nope, you don't.

15:14.788 --> 15:15.623
What letters?

15:16.415 --> 15:17.625
I didn't, uh...

15:17.708 --> 15:19.293
-You didn't?
-No, I didn't.

15:20.794 --> 15:21.629
Good.

15:21.712 --> 15:23.130
What the fuck are you guys talking about?

15:24.173 --> 15:25.674
The...

15:25.758 --> 15:27.843
-surprise.
-The surprise,

15:27.927 --> 15:29.637
'cause your birthday is coming up.

15:29.720 --> 15:32.556
So there's little surprises,
little surprises--

15:40.397 --> 15:41.315
[Judy] I don't get it.

15:41.398 --> 15:44.193
Trust me, I was there, and I have
no fucking idea what just happened.

15:44.276 --> 15:45.778
-She just let you go?
-Yeah.

15:46.153 --> 15:47.237
-What?
-I mean, I...

15:48.030 --> 15:49.406
I couldn't find him, so...

15:50.032 --> 15:53.577
Well, I carved a heart in the tree
right where he was, so we could find him.

15:54.912 --> 15:57.039
Well, that would have been useful to know
two hours ago.

15:57.122 --> 15:59.875
I didn't know you were going there.
I thought you were going to prison.

16:00.751 --> 16:02.544
Well, that's where I fucking should be.

16:03.212 --> 16:04.922
Well, maybe there's a reason you're not.

16:05.506 --> 16:07.883
Like what, I'm going to cure cancer
or something?

16:07.967 --> 16:08.801
Maybe.

16:08.884 --> 16:10.636
I mean, you'd really have to focus.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.139
[Judy laughs]

16:17.476 --> 16:18.978
I can't believe you're sitting here.

16:21.438 --> 16:22.856
How can you even look at me?

16:25.109 --> 16:26.110
I'm so sorry.

16:27.653 --> 16:30.364
Judy, I'm so sorry that I lied to you

16:30.447 --> 16:33.367
and let you blame yourself.

16:33.951 --> 16:35.411
Fucking horrible thing to do.

16:36.203 --> 16:37.037
It is.

16:37.913 --> 16:39.248
You didn't deserve that.

16:40.165 --> 16:41.000
I didn't.

16:44.586 --> 16:47.464
If I were you, I would get up right now

16:47.548 --> 16:50.968
and walk away
and never fucking talk to me again.

16:59.810 --> 17:00.769
I forgive you.

17:01.562 --> 17:02.479
What?

17:04.231 --> 17:05.566
-I forgive--
-Oh, shut up.

17:05.899 --> 17:07.526
-No, you shut up.
-[sighs]

17:09.695 --> 17:11.864
I don't want
to carry around any more pain.

17:13.198 --> 17:14.283
I'm tired...

17:15.159 --> 17:17.411
of feeling sad and hurt.

17:18.579 --> 17:19.830
Okay.

17:19.913 --> 17:21.165
And resenting you...

17:22.291 --> 17:24.168
would just be punishing myself.

17:24.251 --> 17:26.128
-So...
-I don't want you to do that.

17:26.211 --> 17:28.130
-I don't want <i>you </i>to do that.
-[sighs]

17:29.590 --> 17:31.258
How can I not? [scoffs]

17:32.426 --> 17:33.886
I think you have to find a way.

17:35.554 --> 17:36.722
You need to forgive yourself.

17:37.139 --> 17:39.058
-Ew.
-Yeah, I know, it's gross.

17:41.393 --> 17:43.645
But I feel like you've been given
a second chance.

17:44.688 --> 17:45.773
Well, we both have.

17:47.149 --> 17:48.067
Yeah.

17:51.028 --> 17:52.946
I'm sure there's stuff
I have to work on too.

17:53.030 --> 17:54.073
[scoffs] Uh, yeah.

17:54.156 --> 17:55.741
Well, that was a quick response.

17:56.909 --> 17:57.826
I'm open.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.288
You need to start saying "no" more.

18:03.457 --> 18:05.793
[sighs] I know.

18:05.876 --> 18:08.045
-It's disgusting.
-It is hard.

18:08.295 --> 18:10.255
Oh, God.

18:10.589 --> 18:12.049
I know it's early, but...

18:12.800 --> 18:13.801
can we start drinking?

18:14.259 --> 18:15.594
Do I have to start saying no yet?

18:16.303 --> 18:17.221
You can start tomorrow.

18:17.304 --> 18:18.889
Oh, good, I thought that was a test.

18:19.640 --> 18:20.557
Then yes.

18:27.856 --> 18:29.149
[Judy sighs]

18:33.112 --> 18:34.154
I love you.

18:35.072 --> 18:36.156
I love you too.

18:45.999 --> 18:48.669
[Jen] So I'm starting to realize that I...

18:49.419 --> 18:52.464
I never really grieved the death
of my mom.

18:53.799 --> 18:55.092
[Yolanda] Oh, baby.

18:57.469 --> 18:58.679
Thanks. Um...

18:59.513 --> 19:03.058
[exhales] I was--
I was 19 when she died, and, um...

19:04.518 --> 19:05.769
At the time, I was...

19:06.687 --> 19:08.981
I was relieved, you know?

19:09.356 --> 19:11.817
She had been sick for most of my life.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.193
I think I was nine

19:13.777 --> 19:16.196
when she was first diagnosed, and um...

19:17.990 --> 19:19.199
She'd be okay...

19:20.492 --> 19:22.452
then the cancer would come back and...

19:25.289 --> 19:26.498
and I would be mad...

19:27.541 --> 19:29.501
at her every time, like it was...

19:30.586 --> 19:34.840
like, something that she was doing,
that she was choosing it.

19:39.845 --> 19:41.013
And then, um...

19:41.513 --> 19:43.974
[sniffling]

19:44.099 --> 19:46.226
When her body couldn't fight anymore,

19:46.852 --> 19:49.563
I was mad at her because she couldn't.

19:52.691 --> 19:54.902
And I think I've been mad at myself

19:55.694 --> 19:57.029
for that ever since.

19:58.113 --> 19:59.239
[Linda] That's rough.

20:01.366 --> 20:02.868
Thanks, Linda.

20:03.493 --> 20:05.537
[Wayne]
I'm glad you decided to come back, Jen.

20:08.123 --> 20:08.957
Me too.

20:12.169 --> 20:14.379
[sniffling]

20:14.504 --> 20:16.298
Oh, boy.

20:18.759 --> 20:20.052
[pulls tissue from box]

20:21.220 --> 20:22.304
Thanks, Yolanda.

20:23.513 --> 20:26.892
I wasn't sure if you'd be back.
Don't want to get my hopes up.

20:26.975 --> 20:28.477
[laughs] That's funny.

20:29.102 --> 20:30.145
Why's that funny?

20:30.812 --> 20:34.024
'Cause that's how I used to feel
when I was a kid, when you'd disappear.

20:35.150 --> 20:35.984
Okay.

20:36.693 --> 20:37.569
We're getting into it.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.071
-We're not.
-Feels like we are.

20:39.154 --> 20:42.324
We're not. I just want
to have a clean slate with you.

20:43.283 --> 20:45.202
I'm not trying to make you feel bad, Mom.

20:45.577 --> 20:48.038
It was just hard not knowing

20:48.121 --> 20:50.999
where you were or what you'd be like
when you came home.

20:52.793 --> 20:53.627
Okay.

20:55.212 --> 20:56.046
I'm sorry.

20:58.632 --> 21:00.342
But it was hard for me, too.

21:00.968 --> 21:01.802
Okay.

21:02.719 --> 21:04.263
You were a tough baby.

21:04.805 --> 21:05.973
You never slept.

21:06.056 --> 21:07.474
You were always crying.

21:07.683 --> 21:09.268
Just really needy.

21:10.143 --> 21:12.646
I was just a kid myself.
I couldn't handle it.

21:13.814 --> 21:15.357
That's why I started using.

21:18.318 --> 21:20.279
A baby can't make you a drug addict.

21:20.362 --> 21:23.573
Of course not. That's not what I'm saying.

21:23.657 --> 21:24.616
[sighs]

21:24.950 --> 21:26.535
Still really sensitive, huh?

21:26.618 --> 21:28.328
Yeah, I still have feelings.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.747
You've always had a good heart.

21:31.665 --> 21:33.458
You know, I was telling Paula,

21:33.542 --> 21:35.752
she's my friend in here,

21:36.795 --> 21:38.422
what a good girl you are.

21:38.505 --> 21:41.508
That you're gonna help me get a lawyer,
get out of here.

21:42.718 --> 21:45.304
You know, I tried to find the money, Mom,
but I couldn't.

21:45.387 --> 21:48.015
Oh. That's too bad.

21:48.432 --> 21:49.266
Sorry.

21:51.101 --> 21:52.352
Don't worry about the money.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.354
You know what would help me even more?

21:54.980 --> 21:57.816
Is if you wrote a letter
to the parole board

21:58.317 --> 21:59.526
telling 'em I've changed,

21:59.609 --> 22:01.445
that I'm better, you know, all that.

22:02.446 --> 22:04.823
They said that would really mean a lot,
coming from you.

22:07.534 --> 22:09.536
Would you do that for me, Judy Anne?

22:14.207 --> 22:15.042
No.

22:18.920 --> 22:19.755
Why not?

22:22.090 --> 22:23.383
You haven't changed.

22:29.931 --> 22:33.435
[woman panting]
Daisy! Daisy, where'd you go, girl?

22:33.518 --> 22:35.771
-[Daisy barks]
-Hey!

22:35.854 --> 22:36.813
[growling]

22:36.897 --> 22:37.856
Oh!

22:38.065 --> 22:40.942
-[Daisy continues barking]
-Hey, did you find something?

22:42.110 --> 22:43.403
You digging for bones?

22:46.406 --> 22:47.991
Daisy, what are you digging for?

22:54.122 --> 22:55.332
[knock on door]

23:03.131 --> 23:04.591
-Hi.
-Hello, Miss Hale.

23:05.592 --> 23:06.843
I have something for you.

23:07.761 --> 23:08.804
What?

23:09.930 --> 23:12.057
Thank you. Where did you find them?

23:12.140 --> 23:14.976
They were just sitting
in some police lockers. No big deal.

23:15.811 --> 23:17.354
You don't know what this means to me.

23:18.105 --> 23:20.357
-Really.
-Consider it a thank you.

23:21.691 --> 23:26.446
That bag of Mr. Wood's you "happened upon"
was extremely helpful.

Did you listen to the recordings?

23:28.281 --> 23:29.533

-Miss Hale.
-Sorry. Is he gonna get in trouble?

Well, suffice it to say, Hastings will
no longer be chief of police.

-No.

Hey, Detective? Wait.

23:58.520 --> 23:59.896

I think you're a really special person.
