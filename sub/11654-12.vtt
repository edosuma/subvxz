AKU: Long ago, in a distant land,

00:04.547 --> 00:09.385
I, Aku, the shape-shifting
master of darkness,

00:09.469 --> 00:13.139
unleashed an unspeakable evil.

00:13.223 --> 00:18.686
But a foolish Samurai warrior
wielding a magic sword,

00:18.770 --> 00:21.648
stepped forth to oppose me.

Before the final blow was struck,

00:26.694 --> 00:29.280
I tore open a portal in time

00:29.364 --> 00:33.743
and flung him into the future,
where my evil is law.

00:34.244 --> 00:38.289
Now the fool seeks to return to the past

00:38.373 --> 00:42.961
and undo the future that is Aku.

by the tallest of mountains.

It was there, with only 300 men,

08:03.693 --> 08:05.820

08:08.739 --> 08:10.866

09:53.302 --> 09:54.386
How wide is this path?

to move through sideways.
