WEBVTT

01:02.036 --> 01:04.231
...is a journey...
to work my mind,

01:04.266 --> 01:05.964
is my body's work,...

01:09.776 --> 01:11.770
...is expired.

01:11.806 --> 01:16.114
From then my thoughts,
from far where I abide,

01:16.150 --> 01:19.111
intend a zealous pilgrimage
to thee...

01:23.454 --> 01:25.654
And keeping my drooping eyelids
open wide.

01:28.596 --> 01:30.191
Hey, look.

01:30.227 --> 01:31.429
Do you think it's a sign?

01:33.999 --> 01:35.433
He's been following us.

01:37.266 --> 01:38.601
Isn't it mesmerizing?

01:40.941 --> 01:43.144
He's just... waiting to die.

01:45.805 --> 01:47.643
Who would kill
such a beautiful thing?

01:59.590 --> 02:03.164
Please, don't hang the albatross
around my neck.

02:41.795 --> 02:44.238
Come on,
don't do this now!

02:46.532 --> 02:48.305
Don't do this.

02:48.340 --> 02:51.837
Come on, come on!
Not now!

02:51.872 --> 02:54.814
Did you forget
to see the mechanic?

02:54.849 --> 02:56.443
I told you last week.

02:56.478 --> 02:58.711
There's been a lot on my mind.

02:58.746 --> 03:00.185
The house isn't finished yet
and--

03:00.220 --> 03:02.218
The plumber's coming on Monday,
Thomas.

03:02.253 --> 03:04.321
Not much we can do before then.

03:04.356 --> 03:08.285
Hey. We will
get used to this town.

03:08.321 --> 03:10.860
Hey!

03:10.896 --> 03:13.496
The last chapter's
isn't even finished yet,
I still need time to wo-

03:13.531 --> 03:15.735
I don't know why
you keep fiddling with it,

03:15.770 --> 03:16.893
I love your book.

03:16.929 --> 03:18.305
-The publisher...

03:28.515 --> 03:31.376
Don't listen to them,
your ideas, they're good.

03:31.411 --> 03:32.853
You know it!

03:32.888 --> 03:35.045
Well, the ending... isn't good.

03:35.080 --> 03:36.316
I've got to come up
with something better.

03:36.352 --> 03:39.024
It's a family story,

03:39.059 --> 03:40.989
you know it better than anybody.

03:41.025 --> 03:42.821
Elizabeth.

03:42.856 --> 03:45.159
Let's go,
it doesn't look very far.

03:46.430 --> 03:48.167
We're not going anywhere
in that.

03:48.202 --> 03:49.930
Just give me a minute!

03:52.371 --> 03:53.898
You don't always
have to fix things.

03:53.933 --> 03:55.507
It's only
a couple of streets over.

03:55.542 --> 03:58.240
You can't just walk away
from your problems, Thomas.

03:58.275 --> 03:59.708
Maybe I'll solve them.

03:59.743 --> 04:01.676
Who knows, the walk
might be good for my book.

04:01.712 --> 04:05.118
It's been five years,
a night off won't hurt.

04:05.153 --> 04:06.879
Your uncle insisted
on this dinner,

04:06.914 --> 04:09.116
and you're tinkering
with that pile of junk.

04:09.151 --> 04:10.886
Relax,

04:10.922 --> 04:13.761
Uncle Bertram was kind enough
to introduce us to the Burkes,

04:13.796 --> 04:14.952
I'm sure they'll wait.

04:14.987 --> 04:16.588
Now, can I just have
five minutes?

04:37.746 --> 04:39.848
Will you
describe it to me again?

04:42.853 --> 04:46.217
I can't find
the words, Dr. Burke.

04:47.863 --> 04:49.286
Try, Kenny.

04:50.524 --> 04:51.695
Keep sketching.

04:52.766 --> 04:53.796
No.

05:00.142 --> 05:02.200
Look at your drawing
from earlier.

05:07.773 --> 05:09.042
You see any difference?

05:13.350 --> 05:15.254
Mine isn't finished.

05:15.289 --> 05:17.017
You know that's not
what I'm asking.

05:20.026 --> 05:21.186
Take a look again,

05:22.998 --> 05:24.827
the acid should have kicked in.

05:28.302 --> 05:32.164
Has the image
in your mind changed?

05:36.240 --> 05:38.005
No. Not really.

05:41.844 --> 05:43.912
Those shoulders
are more or less the same.

05:46.053 --> 05:47.278
There's a delicacy.

05:50.485 --> 05:51.623
Also a power.

05:53.719 --> 05:54.890
Focus on him.

05:56.196 --> 05:57.788
The conflict is within you.

05:57.823 --> 06:00.467
Me?

06:01.770 --> 06:03.063
Who am I?

06:06.406 --> 06:09.872
Let yourself go
and it will resolve.

06:15.008 --> 06:16.813
Don't you want to fit in,
Kenny?

06:17.512 --> 06:18.551
What is that?

06:19.580 --> 06:20.751
I don't know.

06:27.023 --> 06:28.359
Are you sure
I can't help you with something?

06:28.395 --> 06:29.727
I've got it, Thomas.

06:32.093 --> 06:35.496
Um, there's something
we should talk about.

06:35.532 --> 06:36.902
That I need to tell you--

06:36.938 --> 06:38.763
I know, I know.

06:38.798 --> 06:39.998
Be on my best behavior.

06:40.033 --> 06:41.406
-No!
-'Cause they're high society.

06:41.442 --> 06:43.669
It's not that,
it's just--

06:43.705 --> 06:44.704
Have you tried that pipe?

06:44.739 --> 06:46.671
I know what I'm doing, Thomas.

06:46.706 --> 06:48.306
It's the radiator.

06:49.081 --> 06:50.308
Okay, go.

07:02.988 --> 07:04.355
We should be okay for tonight.

07:13.273 --> 07:14.805
You never cease to amaze me.

07:25.312 --> 07:28.314
Your art will take off
at some point, Carol.

07:28.350 --> 07:31.886
Your work has improved
since you've started
listening to me.

07:31.922 --> 07:34.126
<i> Did they,</i>
<i>Did they like... them?</i>

07:34.161 --> 07:36.120
Carol! They loved them.

07:36.156 --> 07:38.290
-Really?
<i>-Bought the pair, both of 'em.</i>

07:39.969 --> 07:41.301
And the largest one?

07:41.337 --> 07:43.828
<i>Uh, not yet.</i>
<i>But, uh, give it time.</i>

07:43.863 --> 07:46.168
<i>Your art is so unique.</i>

07:46.203 --> 07:48.103
Oh, yes.

07:48.139 --> 07:51.439
<i>Nothing like</i>
<i>those silly doodles</i>
<i>from the old days,</i>

07:51.475 --> 07:53.877
<i>I do miss college.</i>

07:54.773 --> 07:56.345
<i>And Lloyd?</i>

07:56.380 --> 07:57.749
<i>Busy as always?</i>

07:59.113 --> 08:01.615
Are you sure tonight's
not an imposition?

08:01.650 --> 08:03.148
<i>Don't be silly, Bertie.</i>

08:03.184 --> 08:06.822
Well, I appreciate it,
your welcoming my niece.

08:06.858 --> 08:09.860
they've had a difficult
go of it, acclimating.

08:09.896 --> 08:13.696
If she's anything like you,
we'll get along just fine.

08:13.731 --> 08:16.303
You do love
to exaggerate.

08:16.338 --> 08:19.930
Maybe...
they'll even join the Club?

08:19.965 --> 08:20.965
<i>A little premature.</i>

08:21.000 --> 08:23.275
Oh, well, wishful thinking.

08:23.310 --> 08:26.209
<i> You haven't changed.</i>

08:26.244 --> 08:27.877
<i>But look,</i>

08:27.912 --> 08:30.613
just enjoy tonight
and let me know how it goes.

08:30.649 --> 08:33.048
-Talk soon.

08:59.445 --> 09:01.307
Try not to think,

09:03.380 --> 09:04.541
just to be.

09:06.584 --> 09:10.486
Let the music flow through you.

09:34.709 --> 09:35.748
Do you feel it?

09:36.712 --> 09:38.784
It's pulsing.

09:39.714 --> 09:41.186
Succumb to it.

09:41.221 --> 09:42.953
It's suffocating.

10:12.516 --> 10:13.720
It's time,

10:16.421 --> 10:17.823
don't be afraid.

10:21.486 --> 10:24.665
We need to go back there again,
together.

10:26.133 --> 10:27.162
I can help.

10:28.203 --> 10:30.000
You know what to do.

10:41.677 --> 10:43.343
You're not alone.

10:45.549 --> 10:47.050
Describe it to me.

10:50.456 --> 10:52.187
An exquisite negative.

10:59.465 --> 11:01.165
Don't talk like a pansy.

11:05.031 --> 11:06.333
Don't call me that.

11:06.865 --> 11:08.038
Pansy.

11:12.043 --> 11:16.879
College was long ago,
but I know it felt good.

11:16.914 --> 11:19.511
Isn't it
the most beautiful feeling,

11:20.883 --> 11:22.684
to be a
pretty little pansy?

11:22.719 --> 11:24.582
I know it feels good.

11:29.088 --> 11:33.393
Kenny, what do you see?

11:43.243 --> 11:45.073
I don't...

11:45.108 --> 11:49.475
I don't know where I am.
Oh boy, am I afraid.

11:51.344 --> 11:53.815
-Look at the fear...

11:53.850 --> 11:57.752
...and tell me how it feels.

12:48.505 --> 12:51.273
You said you were worried
about being late.

12:54.413 --> 12:55.640
Let's go.

12:59.185 --> 13:01.113
-This place is pretty swanky,
huh?

13:01.148 --> 13:03.387
He's just a doctor, Thomas.

13:03.423 --> 13:05.119
Not my father.

13:05.154 --> 13:07.559
Right, at least she's an artist.

13:07.594 --> 13:10.457
See, we'll have a good time.

13:12.426 --> 13:16.401
Deep breath
before the plunge.

13:16.436 --> 13:19.169
Yeah. Happy faces.

13:28.780 --> 13:31.544
You must be the Mill... ers.

13:33.946 --> 13:35.312
Come in.

13:35.347 --> 13:39.115
It must be cold out, isn't it?

13:43.124 --> 13:44.529
This street is picturesque.

13:44.564 --> 13:46.292
And your home is lovely.

13:46.327 --> 13:49.397
You're too kind.
Please, your coats.

13:55.638 --> 13:56.870
Oh!

13:56.906 --> 13:59.372
This fur is divine.

13:59.407 --> 14:03.012
-Hmm.
-Awfully nice indeed.

14:03.047 --> 14:05.851
Bertie tells me
that you've just moved.

14:05.887 --> 14:08.787
Yes, it's so thoughtful of you
to have us over.

14:08.822 --> 14:11.551
Oh, not at all,
anything for the...

14:13.021 --> 14:14.321
Where have you settled?

14:14.356 --> 14:15.955
Oh, just an old place,
over on Clarence.

14:15.990 --> 14:18.629
The Walker estate.

14:18.664 --> 14:21.533
That is a charming...

14:21.568 --> 14:22.834
-Oh!

14:22.869 --> 14:23.965
-Ah!
-Everything all right?

14:24.001 --> 14:26.069
-Yes.
-Hmm.

14:26.105 --> 14:29.034
I wouldn't
quite call it an estate.

14:29.069 --> 14:32.670
Lloyd won't be long,
he's just finishing,
treating a patient.

14:32.705 --> 14:36.543
Let me go see if he's ready,
won't be a minute.

15:04.236 --> 15:05.440
Hmm.

15:08.880 --> 15:10.676
What was your uncle thinking?

15:10.712 --> 15:12.777
We need to know
more people in this town.

15:14.116 --> 15:15.615
She reminds me of your mother.

15:18.218 --> 15:19.916
She's pleasant enough.

15:23.928 --> 15:25.856
They're not all like my parents.

15:27.430 --> 15:29.862
You have to get out more,
build a community.

15:29.897 --> 15:33.105
Otherwise,
we'll be eating dinner
at the corner diner forever.

15:41.609 --> 15:44.378
I don't know why
you've become so melancholic,

15:44.414 --> 15:47.783
but sometimes it can be
so hard to talk to you.

15:47.819 --> 15:49.121
He's not even hung.

15:55.654 --> 15:58.997
At least give them a fair shot,
Thomas.

15:59.033 --> 16:02.794
Uncle likes them,
so... we should like them.

16:04.836 --> 16:08.536
I'm tired of living
hand-to-mouth because
my parents are angry with me,

16:09.267 --> 16:11.610
I mean us.

16:11.645 --> 16:12.969
Don't start this again.

16:16.150 --> 16:19.181
It's not as though
we'll struggle for much longer,

16:19.216 --> 16:21.681
once your book is published
and...

16:25.126 --> 16:29.027
Like it or not, we can be
a part of this world.

16:29.062 --> 16:31.031
I bet you
they are into some weird shit.

16:32.557 --> 16:37.334
Just... try to be nice, for me.

16:39.069 --> 16:41.036
You want me to put on a show?

16:41.071 --> 16:43.703
-Be that charming...
-Mmm.

16:43.738 --> 16:47.378
...literature student
who swept you off your feet?

16:47.414 --> 16:49.272
Yes!

16:49.308 --> 16:51.043
Bring him back.

17:02.160 --> 17:03.895
They could come back
any second.

17:03.931 --> 17:05.663
-Well, that's all right.

17:07.764 --> 17:09.000
Dear?

17:09.035 --> 17:11.065
I'm in session, Carol.

17:11.100 --> 17:12.702
-They're here.
-Who?

17:14.541 --> 17:15.871
The Millers.

17:15.906 --> 17:17.242
Dinner, remember?

17:19.112 --> 17:21.913
Please, I don't want
to keep them waiting.

17:21.949 --> 17:24.077
We-- We haven't finished.

17:24.113 --> 17:25.580
Carry on without me.

17:26.411 --> 17:28.154
It's important,

17:29.216 --> 17:30.816
Bertie's niece.

17:32.694 --> 17:34.317
I don't want to upset him.

17:39.264 --> 17:42.501
Oh, that's so good.

17:42.536 --> 17:43.598
Hey.

17:44.473 --> 17:46.172
Session's over.

17:47.298 --> 17:48.834
Wake up.

17:54.978 --> 17:56.209
But I'm floating.

17:56.244 --> 17:57.612
You'll come down soon.

17:58.915 --> 18:00.318
Time to go.

18:09.225 --> 18:11.122
But you didn't get to finish.

18:11.158 --> 18:12.528
Next week.

18:15.560 --> 18:17.170
My wife's got company.

19:08.217 --> 19:09.816
Pull up your pants.

19:17.663 --> 19:23.300
He'll be right out, he is just
finishing work with a patient.

19:23.336 --> 19:26.203
You know how busy
the medical profession is.

19:26.238 --> 19:29.542
Or maybe you don't...
do you know?

19:29.578 --> 19:30.705
Are they yours?

19:31.536 --> 19:34.838
Oh, goodness no.

19:34.873 --> 19:37.440
How different you are
than your uncle.

19:37.476 --> 19:38.644
They're Dutch.

19:38.679 --> 19:40.819
17th century,
if I'm not mistaken.

19:40.854 --> 19:43.055
That's right, they are.

19:43.090 --> 19:45.955
Passed down
through Lloyd's family.

19:47.652 --> 19:51.396
Oh, speak of the devil.

19:51.431 --> 19:53.789
I assumed an artist
would display their own work.

19:53.825 --> 19:57.336
Oh, I couldn't possibly,
could I?

19:57.371 --> 20:01.034
You'll see them in the studio,
I'll give a tour later.

20:01.069 --> 20:04.237
Maybe we can get
a few more pieces
into her uncle's gallery.

20:04.272 --> 20:06.346
What a great idea.

20:06.381 --> 20:09.639
-I don't have much say
over his collection.
-He has...

20:09.675 --> 20:11.348
the most exquisite taste.

20:11.383 --> 20:15.149
Now, last month,
there was a charity auction.

20:15.185 --> 20:16.651
And my pieces sold.

20:16.686 --> 20:18.857
Bertram would be
impressed, no doubt.

20:18.892 --> 20:21.525
It's so important
to have an advocate,
when your career is in the arts.

20:21.561 --> 20:23.919
Uh-huh. He's been
very encouraging of my work.

20:23.955 --> 20:25.496
So,
what are you working on now?

20:25.531 --> 20:28.057
-A most wonderful series...
-Same time next week.

20:28.092 --> 20:29.997
...an in-depth depiction
of China.

20:30.032 --> 20:32.003
Oh!
We were just-- Elizabeth,
remember that museum?

20:32.038 --> 20:33.333
They have this, uh, exhibit...

20:33.368 --> 20:36.008
Elizabeth... Elizabeth?

20:36.044 --> 20:37.939
-Mm-hmm?
-The museum? Ming Dynasty?

20:37.974 --> 20:39.007
Lloyd?

20:39.042 --> 20:41.138
Lloyd, dear.

20:43.117 --> 20:47.287
I swear!
You could be a mad scientist.

20:49.648 --> 20:52.718
Ah, I got distracted.

20:52.753 --> 20:57.990
You really must
take care of yourself.

20:59.767 --> 21:02.025
I laid a tie out.

21:02.060 --> 21:05.066
-I'm wearing one.

21:05.101 --> 21:08.240
It's dinner.

21:08.276 --> 21:11.109
Well,
Bertie's always been a planner,

21:11.145 --> 21:13.275
but he didn't say much
about you.

21:13.310 --> 21:16.481
Tom, dear, tell us what you do.

21:16.516 --> 21:19.712
Oh, Elizabeth's job is much more
interesting than mine.

21:19.747 --> 21:21.313
She's a wife,
I know what she does.

21:21.349 --> 21:23.419
I'm an engineer.

21:23.454 --> 21:26.321
How can you work
and raise a family?

21:26.357 --> 21:27.991
We don't have children.

21:28.027 --> 21:29.788
Oh, how avant-garde.

21:29.823 --> 21:32.729
Probably
a blessing in disguise.

21:32.765 --> 21:36.127
It'd be very difficult
to raise a child like that.

21:39.006 --> 21:40.571
It's tough enough as it is.

21:42.176 --> 21:43.833
And how did the engineer
end up with a--

21:43.868 --> 21:45.439
Thomas is an exceptional writer.

21:45.474 --> 21:47.912
I knew you must be interesting.

21:47.947 --> 21:49.181
We met at Harvard.

21:49.216 --> 21:53.117
Times sure have changed.

21:53.152 --> 21:55.088
But what do you write about?

21:55.123 --> 21:57.517
Oh, you know, this and that.

21:57.553 --> 21:58.750
Try the chutney.

21:58.786 --> 21:59.750
You must have an inkling?

21:59.785 --> 22:01.258
He doesn't like to share ideas,

22:01.294 --> 22:04.091
but that's how
we artists create.

22:04.126 --> 22:07.457
How will he know
his ideas are good
if people don't tell him?

22:07.493 --> 22:08.462
I'll know!

22:08.497 --> 22:09.864
Well, there's no need to fuss.

22:11.333 --> 22:13.163
Tell me, please.

22:13.199 --> 22:15.037
-Well...
It's a very moving novel,

22:15.073 --> 22:17.175
an opus, really.

22:17.211 --> 22:19.010
He's been
working on it for years.

22:19.046 --> 22:21.004
Well, it's a family story.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.111
It's much more than that.

22:23.147 --> 22:27.949
It's a multi-generational saga,
based on Thomas' father,
his grandfather.

22:27.984 --> 22:31.384
It delves into
our greatest fears,
our greatest hopes.

22:31.420 --> 22:33.357
Oh, family.

22:33.392 --> 22:36.390
Oh, I never cared
for heavy reading.

22:36.425 --> 22:37.623
It's with my publisher.

22:37.659 --> 22:38.823
So, what's the hold up?

22:38.859 --> 22:40.860
They want to alter
the manuscript,

22:40.896 --> 22:43.033
make it more palatable
for mainstream readers.

22:43.069 --> 22:44.568
Well, they're right,

22:44.604 --> 22:47.633
no reason to write a book
if no one will buy it.

22:47.668 --> 22:49.033
That's what my publisher says.

22:49.069 --> 22:51.136
What do people
want to read, anyway?

22:52.276 --> 22:53.644
Something less colored.

22:55.846 --> 22:58.545
The publisher wants you
to compromise your ideas.

22:58.580 --> 23:00.520
His integrity as an artist.

23:00.555 --> 23:03.015
Integrity?
Well, there's little of that
in this house.

23:03.050 --> 23:07.921
Oh, well. Don't mind him.
He's awful.

23:07.957 --> 23:11.497
Actually, I have been
working on something new.

23:12.096 --> 23:13.065
You have?

23:13.100 --> 23:16.397
Yes. A love story of sorts.

23:16.432 --> 23:20.105
Oh, I love love stories.

23:20.140 --> 23:21.900
Are they star-crossed lovers?

23:21.935 --> 23:25.335
A tortured man,
who's fallen in love.

23:25.370 --> 23:28.106
He's torn between the demands
society's placed on him,

23:28.142 --> 23:31.416
and his secret lover,
and his ambitions in work.

23:31.452 --> 23:33.943
And do they live
happily ever after?

23:33.978 --> 23:36.285
Unsure, I haven't decided yet.

23:36.320 --> 23:39.021
Oh, they must!

23:39.056 --> 23:42.118
-It all culminates
on the cliffs of California.

23:42.153 --> 23:44.461
The couple is followed
by an albatross,

23:44.496 --> 23:47.623
a large bird,
you see, a good omen.

23:47.659 --> 23:48.864
Religion?

23:50.166 --> 23:51.504
Freedom.

23:53.173 --> 23:54.771
Sounds right up my alley.

23:57.575 --> 24:00.104
I know what it is
to be an outsider.

24:00.139 --> 24:01.974
And then what?
What happens next?

24:02.009 --> 24:04.047
You'll just have to read it
to find out.

24:07.352 --> 24:10.782
I do like this much more.

24:10.817 --> 24:13.785
Everyone likes a good fairytale.

24:13.820 --> 24:15.721
Oh, if you'd like to smoke...

24:15.756 --> 24:17.088
They're fine, Carol.

24:17.123 --> 24:19.661
You may be a doctor,
but only of the mind.

24:19.696 --> 24:21.501
-Could you go outside?
-Of course.

24:22.199 --> 24:23.393
Excuse us.

24:36.642 --> 24:38.012
That book,

24:40.154 --> 24:41.851
that's quite the imagination.

24:43.614 --> 24:49.421
Can you imagine a world
where a couple like that
is normal?

24:49.456 --> 24:50.926
I can't.

24:59.468 --> 25:00.938
Not having one?

25:00.973 --> 25:02.003
Nuh-uh.

25:15.250 --> 25:17.880
When I told you to be nice,
I didn't want you to kiss ass.

25:19.658 --> 25:23.189
I'm curious,
it's what makes a good writer.

25:25.364 --> 25:26.764
What's with the new book?

25:27.926 --> 25:29.459
It's a little fluffy.

25:33.031 --> 25:34.772
I should be published by now.

25:36.707 --> 25:39.068
At least I know
Carol will read it.

25:39.103 --> 25:40.976
But that woman is so vapid.

25:42.709 --> 25:44.078
Target audience.

25:45.043 --> 25:46.751
You're smarter than this.

25:51.752 --> 25:53.318
Can't have it both ways.

25:58.528 --> 25:59.632
Maybe you were right.

26:02.630 --> 26:03.669
Should we leave?

26:05.866 --> 26:07.167
They'd never invite us back.

26:08.902 --> 26:11.168
It's too late to jump ship,

26:11.203 --> 26:12.502
she's already served
hors d'oeuvres.

26:14.244 --> 26:15.274
Come on.

26:23.383 --> 26:27.587
What's he talking about,
"tradition rests upon fear"?

26:27.623 --> 26:29.354
The fear of change.

26:30.560 --> 26:32.894
Look at these moldings,

26:32.929 --> 26:35.429
they're traditional
and ever so beautiful.

26:35.465 --> 26:37.366
This furniture.

26:37.402 --> 26:39.434
And I'm not scared.

26:39.470 --> 26:40.869
Well, you should be.

26:40.904 --> 26:42.605
It's the illusion of tradition.

26:42.641 --> 26:45.375
This isn't even old.

26:45.410 --> 26:47.278
But it's Chippendale.

26:47.314 --> 26:49.774
What, um, do you suggest?

26:49.809 --> 26:51.275
A paradigm shift.

26:51.310 --> 26:54.654
That sounds scary.
Scarier than tradition.

26:56.116 --> 26:59.553
Things change,
but not that much.

26:59.588 --> 27:02.789
-But earlier
we agreed that times ch...
-Oh... No.

27:02.824 --> 27:06.928
You of all people
would appreciate just how
quickly things can change.

27:06.964 --> 27:09.067
I mean, a scholarship
to Harvard, and now--

27:09.102 --> 27:10.401
Dinner here.

27:10.436 --> 27:13.970
Oh, yes, and how lucky we are.

27:15.639 --> 27:17.237
I meant it in a different way.

27:18.842 --> 27:22.274
You see, change occurs
at two rates.

27:22.310 --> 27:25.144
We've had major waves
of civilization, you know,

27:25.179 --> 27:28.278
the Stone Age, Bronze Age,
Iron and so on.

27:28.314 --> 27:30.345
But it also occurs
on a smaller scale,

27:30.381 --> 27:33.749
through rapid,
successive events.

27:33.784 --> 27:36.356
Which seems like a large amount
of progress from yesterday,

27:36.392 --> 27:39.421
really isn't all that different
than what happened last year,

27:39.456 --> 27:42.124
when we compare it
to 500 years ago.

27:42.160 --> 27:45.169
It takes a paradigm shift,

27:45.205 --> 27:49.435
one of these pivot events
in the large arcs,
to really create change.

27:49.470 --> 27:54.040
Whoosh. This is going
straight over my head.

27:54.075 --> 27:56.309
Thomas is a big thinker.

27:56.345 --> 28:01.045
Uh, okay, we're in the age
of science, right?

28:01.080 --> 28:02.287
And before that, religion...

28:02.322 --> 28:04.383
Be a dear, top me up.

28:06.324 --> 28:07.518
The wine.

28:11.229 --> 28:12.259
Right.

28:13.862 --> 28:17.361
Well, we relied on blind faith,

28:17.397 --> 28:21.064
a ruling class to tell us
what we should do,

28:21.100 --> 28:23.402
defining what's possible.

28:24.444 --> 28:25.943
And what has science done?

28:28.582 --> 28:32.981
Empowered man
to decide for himself,

28:33.016 --> 28:36.248
not what he should do
but what he can do.

28:36.284 --> 28:40.089
But now...
Now I'm looking forward.

28:42.890 --> 28:49.767
You see, there's a shift
towards using technology
to empower our own philosophy,

28:49.802 --> 28:52.533
what we can and should do,
as defined by...

28:52.569 --> 28:54.136
Society.

28:59.208 --> 29:02.779
I was hoping a man in psychology
would say self.

29:02.814 --> 29:05.712
Have you used
lysergic acid before?

29:05.748 --> 29:08.078
It's rather freeing.

29:08.113 --> 29:09.379
What is that?

29:09.414 --> 29:11.189
Oh, just something I use
in treatments.

29:11.225 --> 29:13.220
No, I haven't.

29:13.256 --> 29:18.597
Good for you, Tom.
I just say "no" to drugs too.

29:18.632 --> 29:20.627
But you're an artiste.

29:24.261 --> 29:27.169
Carol? Lloyd?

29:29.973 --> 29:32.207
You're not
being burgled, are you?

29:37.178 --> 29:39.214
I saw you outside,
you riff-raff.

29:40.177 --> 29:41.950
Casing the joint.

29:41.985 --> 29:43.816
Your ratty car's still
in the drive.

29:43.852 --> 29:45.322
What does she want?

29:48.258 --> 29:51.793
I am not scared of you!

29:51.828 --> 29:53.398
We should've taken your car.

29:53.433 --> 29:54.389
We have guests.

29:54.424 --> 29:55.892
Don't be ridiculous, he was--

29:55.927 --> 29:57.459
I know,

29:57.495 --> 29:59.397
but they're in
the Walker estate,

29:59.433 --> 30:02.266
you know, the old colonial
over on Clarence.

30:02.302 --> 30:05.139
You could stay,
get to know them.

30:05.175 --> 30:09.076
No, no.
I have a key-lime in the oven.

30:09.111 --> 30:11.082
Shouldn't help
burn the house down.

30:11.117 --> 30:14.615
Carol's mother, she makes
the most delicious pies.

30:14.651 --> 30:15.784
No, I've made--

30:15.819 --> 30:17.082
She adores key-lime.

30:17.117 --> 30:18.649
-She does?
-Mm-hmm.

30:25.695 --> 30:27.328
Mother!

30:27.363 --> 30:29.934
This isn't something
the Club stands for.

30:29.970 --> 30:32.430
How can I trust you
to finish the seating chart

30:32.465 --> 30:34.363
when this
is who you invite to dinner?!

30:34.398 --> 30:36.802
Carol, this is beneath you!

30:36.838 --> 30:38.169
Her uncle owns--

30:38.204 --> 30:40.170
Don't you value your membership?

30:40.205 --> 30:42.442
Of course, it's just...

30:45.180 --> 30:47.183
This is not just any club,
Carol.

30:48.751 --> 30:50.619
This is our Club.

30:50.654 --> 30:53.382
I know, I'm sorry.

30:53.417 --> 30:56.720
But please, she wants key lime.

31:03.369 --> 31:08.969
So, now you've met Barb,
our private security.
She lives next door.

31:09.004 --> 31:12.244
I hope she didn't startle you.

31:12.279 --> 31:13.401
Not at all.

31:13.437 --> 31:15.374
Armed, but not dangerous.

31:15.410 --> 31:18.078
She's coming back with dessert,
you'll love her.

31:18.114 --> 31:20.983
She dictates
the social calendar,

31:21.018 --> 31:23.250
she can get you
into the Club like that.

31:23.285 --> 31:26.348
Carol, they won't have
to worry about that.

31:26.383 --> 31:27.652
Oh, yes, that's right.

31:29.722 --> 31:34.164
You know, these things
are out of our hands, really.

31:37.604 --> 31:41.573
Well, time for that tour?

31:41.608 --> 31:43.439
Why don't you girls go ahead,

31:43.474 --> 31:46.473
I thought
it might be a good idea
to show Thomas my office.

31:47.646 --> 31:48.912
That's private, dear.

31:48.947 --> 31:51.883
I know,
but thinking about his book,

31:51.918 --> 31:54.182
he might get some good
reference material.

31:54.218 --> 31:56.381
Ground the philosophy
with some psychology.

31:56.416 --> 31:58.282
But tonight
was supposed to be...

31:58.317 --> 31:59.789
That would add so much depth.

31:59.825 --> 32:01.892
Shouldn't we see my art?

32:01.928 --> 32:03.361
I'm looking forward to it.

32:03.396 --> 32:05.525
Oh, goodie.

32:05.560 --> 32:10.225
Oh, you'll love my studio,
and Tom, we'll show after.

32:10.260 --> 32:11.260
We'll swap.

32:11.296 --> 32:13.028
Now, it's important

32:13.064 --> 32:16.304
that you tell your uncle about
the source of my inspiration.

32:16.340 --> 32:19.469
You'll see behind the curtain.
No judgment, okay?

32:19.505 --> 32:21.706
Art is a process,
I understand.

32:23.347 --> 32:26.610
What's your office like?
How do you treat your patients?

32:26.646 --> 32:29.079
I was working with
a challenging case today.

32:29.115 --> 32:30.282
Social normalcy.

32:30.318 --> 32:32.384
What about patient
confidentiality?

32:32.419 --> 32:34.059
Well, I won't tell,
if you won't.

32:46.937 --> 32:49.736
And you prefer working here?

32:49.771 --> 32:53.107
Well, some of my patients
require specific treatments

32:53.143 --> 32:55.446
that are easier exercised
at home.

32:55.481 --> 32:56.677
Why's that?

32:56.712 --> 32:57.679
Privacy.

32:59.182 --> 33:01.746
You're welcome to them,
the books.

33:02.620 --> 33:03.649
Thank you.

33:05.991 --> 33:08.992
Remarkable,
is that Carol's work?

33:09.027 --> 33:12.925
Oh, God, no.
A patient's.

33:12.961 --> 33:14.497
May I?

33:14.533 --> 33:15.562
Of course.

33:17.803 --> 33:20.472
You use art in treatment?

33:20.507 --> 33:23.438
And in diagnosis.

33:23.473 --> 33:27.904
It's very effective in isolating
traumatic experience.

33:29.209 --> 33:31.648
And comparing drawings

33:31.684 --> 33:35.351
helps in understanding
our subconscious expression
towards those events.

33:37.322 --> 33:39.520
Do you see the difference
between this one and that?

33:42.159 --> 33:45.695
Well,
she must have hated that man.

33:45.731 --> 33:47.732
Why do you say that?

33:47.767 --> 33:48.897
The lines are so aggressive.

33:48.932 --> 33:51.227
Not what I was asking.

33:51.262 --> 33:54.029
I find it interesting that
you think these were drawn
by a woman.

33:56.335 --> 33:59.111
Weren't they?

33:59.742 --> 34:00.772
No.

34:02.012 --> 34:05.150
But, um, good observation.

34:06.514 --> 34:08.687
Aggressive lines
indicate power and passion.

34:08.722 --> 34:10.748
A certain degree of excitement.

34:10.783 --> 34:14.786
Events and memories
are all about perception.

34:18.530 --> 34:20.823
Hmm.

34:20.858 --> 34:22.992
Is that why you were
so intrigued at dinner?

34:25.197 --> 34:26.895
My story.

34:26.930 --> 34:29.504
So much so, I wonder
where it came from.

34:31.140 --> 34:34.146
You know. Here and there.

34:41.584 --> 34:46.081
Um... Water rings
damage the stone. It's porous.

34:47.453 --> 34:48.627
Why don't you take a seat?

34:48.662 --> 34:50.024
Aw, that would be weird.

34:50.059 --> 34:51.796
Nothing weird about it.

34:51.831 --> 34:54.356
We might even find some answers.

34:54.392 --> 34:55.533
About your book.

34:55.569 --> 34:56.724
I'd rather not.

34:56.760 --> 34:58.962
-Sit.

35:04.242 --> 35:08.807
So, you really have
no idea how it ends?

35:09.616 --> 35:11.109
I'm tapped out.

35:11.145 --> 35:12.382
That's a shame.

35:13.978 --> 35:17.651
Perhaps you just need
to loosen up a little.

35:22.826 --> 35:24.656
I'm curious,

35:24.691 --> 35:28.660
the birds in your book
represent freedom.

35:28.695 --> 35:30.532
Is that something
you've struggled with?

35:41.509 --> 35:43.545
Tell me more
about what you see.

35:55.992 --> 35:57.757
So, this is China.

36:01.466 --> 36:05.202
There are so many
things to think about.

36:05.237 --> 36:12.271
Light, color, tone, shading.
And the texture!

36:12.573 --> 36:15.577
Oh, I do love
creating the textures.

36:16.979 --> 36:18.973
See here,

36:19.009 --> 36:23.750
how the light folds
behind the petal.

36:25.424 --> 36:28.260
It's very challenging
to get that part just right.

36:29.888 --> 36:31.793
I never quite considered art
this way.

36:31.829 --> 36:32.891
You must.

36:34.400 --> 36:38.303
Your uncle
has a remarkable
knack for curating.

36:48.205 --> 36:53.945
So much of our life is waiting
for flowers to bloom.

36:56.719 --> 37:02.660
If I can make them bloom
forever, why shouldn't I?

37:02.696 --> 37:06.524
When you mentioned China,
I imagined something
a bit more cultured.

37:06.559 --> 37:09.593
You are a funny girl.

37:09.629 --> 37:11.828
Do you think any of this
is easy?

37:11.863 --> 37:14.169
Just be thankful
you don't have kids,

37:14.204 --> 37:17.005
because the men never help.

37:17.040 --> 37:20.441
Even when they say they will,
they'd rather go off
and talk about...

37:20.476 --> 37:23.238
...only the Lord knows what.

37:24.214 --> 37:26.183
My Thomas isn't like that.

37:26.218 --> 37:30.289
They all are,
corporate homosexuals.

37:36.930 --> 37:40.688
Look, I'm sorry to startle you,

37:40.724 --> 37:42.893
but they truly are.

37:42.928 --> 37:45.598
Getting off
on stroking each other's ego.

37:45.633 --> 37:48.466
And so you paint
tulips and teacups.

37:48.502 --> 37:50.136
What else should I paint?

37:50.172 --> 37:51.967
Something real?

37:52.002 --> 37:54.140
What could be more real
than tulips?

37:56.678 --> 38:00.717
Ah... It's my son,
I won't be a minute.

38:00.753 --> 38:01.782
Excuse me.

38:04.155 --> 38:06.688
Hello? Is everything all right?

38:07.993 --> 38:09.691
I knew it.

38:11.029 --> 38:14.465
This house, your wife,

38:15.803 --> 38:19.833
a son... the ideal.

38:20.838 --> 38:22.832
Hardly.

38:22.868 --> 38:25.069
He's the reason
I've not retired.

38:29.307 --> 38:32.076
Do you know how much it costs
to raise a kid these days?

38:36.517 --> 38:38.049
We've been trying for years,

38:39.387 --> 38:40.821
haven't been able to.

38:44.458 --> 38:45.892
I know it upsets her.

38:53.204 --> 38:54.670
Are you writing this down?

38:55.807 --> 38:57.002
Focus,

38:58.209 --> 39:01.105
fertility is very difficult.

39:04.650 --> 39:08.046
Do you think this is why
you've decided to write
about men?

39:11.515 --> 39:13.153
Uh.

39:15.186 --> 39:18.595
I just need to step out
for a moment,

39:20.725 --> 39:23.529
but I want you to, um...

39:23.564 --> 39:26.370
think about this connection.

39:26.405 --> 39:30.805
There might be something
buried deep down.

39:40.119 --> 39:41.816
You want me to stay here?

41:21.781 --> 41:23.679
Kenny, you can't be here.

41:23.715 --> 41:25.018
But my teddy!

41:25.816 --> 41:27.083
I have guests.

41:27.118 --> 41:28.789
Then we need to finish
what we started.

41:28.824 --> 41:31.662
Yeah, well,
session's over until next week.

41:32.858 --> 41:34.159
But I'll miss you.

41:44.573 --> 41:48.943
We can't do this, not now.

41:50.817 --> 41:52.507
Please.

41:54.478 --> 41:56.786
I'll find your damn bear
and give it to you later.

42:15.406 --> 42:17.240
I... uh, I told you to wait.

42:17.276 --> 42:19.534
Needed a refill.

42:20.941 --> 42:23.545
She, uh,
she never lets me have one.

42:23.581 --> 42:26.348
Carol.
She's pretty tough on you?

42:26.384 --> 42:28.048
Mmm. She has her reasons.

42:32.515 --> 42:36.254
He's, uh... He's not
just your patient, is he?

42:48.767 --> 42:49.971
Does she know?

42:54.476 --> 42:55.543
She doesn't mind?

42:55.579 --> 42:58.012
Of course not,
we compromise.

42:59.917 --> 43:02.352
So, what are you doing
married to a girl like Liz?

43:02.388 --> 43:04.285
She's not just a girl.

43:04.321 --> 43:05.555
She's pampered.

43:05.590 --> 43:07.019
No matter how much
she renounces it,

43:07.055 --> 43:08.519
she'll never understand
your struggle, Thomas.

43:08.555 --> 43:10.192
She does.

43:10.228 --> 43:11.925
I can empathize,

43:11.961 --> 43:15.357
I mean, why fight alone
if you don't have to?

43:15.392 --> 43:17.669
It's tough being on the outside,
looking in.

43:21.501 --> 43:25.204
-It's, uh, getting late.
I better go find Liz.

43:28.281 --> 43:30.546
What's wrong with you, anyway?

43:30.582 --> 43:32.140
Let's get you back
on that sofa.

43:32.176 --> 43:34.044
No, I think I'm good.

43:34.080 --> 43:36.445
I'll be the one
to determine that.

43:36.481 --> 43:40.788
You and Liz, you,
you have more proble--

43:40.823 --> 43:42.551
You better get that
taken care of.

43:44.761 --> 43:46.959
More problems
than you can think, huh?

43:46.994 --> 43:49.800
But suit yourself,
go find your wife.

44:03.015 --> 44:04.243
What?

44:05.516 --> 44:07.809
That's just a hobby.

44:07.844 --> 44:11.316
You'll finish school
and you'll be a doctor
like your father.

44:16.387 --> 44:20.092
I don't care
who said you've got talent.

44:20.128 --> 44:23.627
-Carol, Carol.
-<i> You should care!</i>

44:23.662 --> 44:28.702
Look, uh, I've got to go.
Mom's downstairs<i> .</i>
Coming, Mom!

44:28.738 --> 44:30.432
We'll finish this later.
Promise.

44:30.467 --> 44:31.743
<i>-We're trying to talk!</i>

44:34.140 --> 44:37.041
His future
is very important to me.

44:37.077 --> 44:39.141
I'll just need a minute
to change.

44:39.176 --> 44:41.181
Tell my mom I'll be right down.

44:57.762 --> 44:58.803
Mmm.

45:38.739 --> 45:41.411
Hello? Hello?

45:41.446 --> 45:42.544
<i>Uncle.</i>

45:42.579 --> 45:44.878
Yes?

45:44.914 --> 45:46.514
We're cutting the evening
short.

45:46.549 --> 45:47.783
<i>What happened?</i>

45:47.818 --> 45:50.946
I wanted you to hear it from me,
not her.

45:50.981 --> 45:52.613
<i>Elizabeth?</i>

45:52.648 --> 45:56.218
<i>There's no neighborly love.</i>

45:56.253 --> 45:57.886
<i>This entire night feels off.</i>

45:57.921 --> 46:00.389
<i>You and Thomas can't live</i>
<i>in a bubble forever.</i>

46:00.425 --> 46:03.691
<i>What will you do</i>
<i>when the baby comes?</i>

46:03.726 --> 46:05.260
<i>I thought if you could</i>
<i>meet some people...</i>

46:05.295 --> 46:07.365
But these aren't our people.

46:07.400 --> 46:10.641
Well they're mine,
and this is the real world.

46:10.676 --> 46:13.369
<i>Hmm.</i>
<i>And that's the other thing,</i>

46:13.405 --> 46:15.771
Thomas isn't even working
on his book.

46:15.806 --> 46:19.943
He's got something new, a...
a love story, a harlequin novel.

46:19.978 --> 46:23.288
<i>Well, he needs to get published</i>
<i>before he can write</i>
<i>what he wants.</i>

46:23.323 --> 46:24.548
Uh-huh.

46:26.088 --> 46:29.718
<i>You haven't told him yet,</i>
<i>have you?</i>

46:31.321 --> 46:33.293
<i>What are you so afraid of?</i>

46:36.428 --> 46:39.395
That one, the tulip?
Yes, it's for sale.

46:39.430 --> 46:43.805
<i>Elizabeth,</i>
<i>it's time to grow up.</i>

46:50.884 --> 46:56.281
Burglary, really?
That's a little extreme.

46:56.316 --> 46:58.890
It's just such an eye sore.

46:59.953 --> 47:01.284
Barb, it has character.

47:01.320 --> 47:03.652
-Suits the driver.

47:03.688 --> 47:05.361
She thinks
you'll get them into the club.

47:05.397 --> 47:06.931
Never!

47:06.966 --> 47:10.497
Don't blame me, she's chosen
her seat at our table.

47:10.533 --> 47:11.700
Play nice.

47:11.735 --> 47:13.432
I'll try.

47:14.674 --> 47:16.369
Excuse me,
have you seen my husband?

47:20.810 --> 47:22.012
What do you think?

47:24.882 --> 47:28.887
It's a...
I'm not sure how to...

47:33.492 --> 47:37.192
Zip me, dear. Please.

47:47.839 --> 47:50.373
You can put your hands on me.

47:50.408 --> 47:51.470
I shouldn't.

47:52.939 --> 47:54.577
Because of Lloyd?

47:54.612 --> 47:56.046
Because of Elizabeth.

48:07.425 --> 48:08.454
Hmm.

48:15.296 --> 48:17.936
Now you see what Bertram sees.
Don't you?

48:20.230 --> 48:21.302
I didn't say that.

48:22.808 --> 48:25.835
By the end of the night,
you will.

48:25.871 --> 48:31.576
Bertie says that
"Tulips and Teacups"
will be in every house.

48:38.917 --> 48:39.920
Really?

48:39.955 --> 48:43.258
Well, every house that matters.

48:45.631 --> 48:47.922
He says that I'm brilliant.

48:59.774 --> 49:03.309
Lloyd,
you really invite
the most interesting people.

49:03.344 --> 49:06.113
Her uncle
represents Carol's art.

49:06.148 --> 49:09.146
Your uncle...
your uncle is Bertram?

49:09.181 --> 49:12.219
Oh, Lloyd, shame on you.

49:12.254 --> 49:15.383
You never told me Elizabeth
was a Fontaine.

49:15.418 --> 49:17.092
From California, right?

49:17.127 --> 49:19.128
-Yup.
Must have slipped my mind.

49:19.163 --> 49:21.723
We've been trying
to get your uncle

49:21.759 --> 49:24.399
to accept an invitation
to the Club for years.

49:24.435 --> 49:28.738
And we don't ask just anyone,
you know, it's very exclusive.

49:28.773 --> 49:30.575
Does any of this really matter?

49:30.610 --> 49:33.174
Of course it does.

49:33.210 --> 49:36.270
The Club is the foundation
of our community.

49:36.306 --> 49:37.474
It's who we are.

49:37.509 --> 49:39.349
I prefer a more solid
foundation.

49:39.384 --> 49:44.311
What's she... No, no.
There is nothing wrong
with our homes.

49:44.347 --> 49:46.321
No. Not a thing.

49:47.453 --> 49:50.191
How did you land
the Walker estate?

49:50.226 --> 49:52.459
We're renting, the carriage...

49:52.494 --> 49:55.726
Exploring our options
before we make a commitment.

49:57.160 --> 49:58.130
Saving.

49:58.165 --> 49:59.768
Well, how's your portfolio?

49:59.803 --> 50:01.072
We get by.

50:02.800 --> 50:04.704
It's too risky
to get in the market right now.

50:04.740 --> 50:07.669
It's too risky not to.
You better get that book
published.

50:07.704 --> 50:09.672
He's doing what he can, dear.

50:09.707 --> 50:11.641
Sounds like
he's making excuses.

50:11.676 --> 50:13.851
I'm not talking about
buying Wall Street,

50:13.886 --> 50:15.650
just enough to keep
Lizzie happy.

50:15.685 --> 50:16.853
I am happy.

50:16.889 --> 50:18.284
Don't let him know that.

50:18.319 --> 50:21.620
We're never happy.

50:21.655 --> 50:23.685
Well, it doesn't take much
to get started.

50:23.720 --> 50:27.398
Just a little nepotism,
or a windfall.

50:27.433 --> 50:28.390
Is that all?

50:28.425 --> 50:29.697
Or hard work, of course.

50:29.733 --> 50:31.232
True, very true.

50:31.268 --> 50:35.397
As an artiste, hard work
is absolutely mandatory.

50:35.432 --> 50:38.840
-Flinging paint against
a canvas is hardly laborious.

50:38.876 --> 50:44.548
In 200 years, do you think
people will really care about
"Teacups and Tulips"?

50:44.583 --> 50:49.849
I like that,
such an apt description
of your little paintings.

50:52.521 --> 50:54.816
"Teacups and Tulips."

50:54.852 --> 50:57.590
Tom, dear,
won't you play me a song?

50:58.964 --> 51:00.494
You do know how to play,
don't you?

51:12.745 --> 51:15.179
I knew this was a good idea.

51:17.947 --> 51:19.177
You're rather good.

51:19.212 --> 51:20.510
Well, I studied under...

51:20.546 --> 51:23.781
Mom! Come here.
The seating chart.

51:31.131 --> 51:35.959
Oh, this configuration
is rather radical, Carol.

51:35.994 --> 51:41.033
That's just the point,
what if we seat
Liz and Tom here.

51:41.069 --> 51:43.036
-Never.
-Or here.

51:43.071 --> 51:44.709
Always stirring the pot.

51:44.744 --> 51:46.867
It is for charity after all.

51:46.902 --> 51:48.404
Wouldn't it look good
in the press?

51:48.440 --> 51:50.978
Show these programs work.

51:51.013 --> 51:52.379
What programs are those?

51:52.414 --> 51:55.079
We're fundraising
for African orphanages.

51:56.953 --> 51:58.990
But I'm from Chicago.

51:59.025 --> 52:00.321
They wouldn't need
to know that.

52:00.356 --> 52:02.552
Don't get carried away, Carol.

52:02.588 --> 52:06.459
You'd be there.
We'd all be there.

52:06.494 --> 52:10.696
Mmm. Oh, I do love
integrating new members.

52:12.534 --> 52:16.106
We could even seat them
with Victor and Helena.

52:16.141 --> 52:17.603
Oh, not Victor,
you know he's--

52:17.639 --> 52:20.236
But he's interesting,
Mother, isn't he?

52:21.871 --> 52:24.942
Hmm, friends with Father
and all.

52:24.977 --> 52:28.513
Ever since that legal
fiasco, he's been wretched.

52:28.548 --> 52:32.088
Oh, yes,
I almost forgot about...

52:32.124 --> 52:34.484
You never remember.

52:34.520 --> 52:37.987
But he
is in the club, and if he's
in the club, he's in the group,

52:38.022 --> 52:41.255
and if he's in the group, well,
he's practically family.

52:41.290 --> 52:47.533
And if he's almost family, well,
then how could we be mad?

52:47.568 --> 52:49.635
Oh, Carol, you're a silly girl.

52:49.671 --> 52:54.069
You need to remember where...
Where is he going?

52:55.539 --> 52:57.639
I have no idea.

52:57.674 --> 52:59.547
But yes. Forget about Victor.

52:59.582 --> 53:03.044
Do you think the Greens?
The Greens might like them.

53:03.080 --> 53:06.719
Mmm. Stop it, Carol,
this won't happen.

53:08.720 --> 53:11.822
-Carol...

53:11.858 --> 53:15.866
Isn't that funny,
I've never noticed them before.

53:15.901 --> 53:18.326
They're unexpected.

53:18.362 --> 53:20.363
Oh, those.

53:23.200 --> 53:26.469
And the statue in the foyer,
adds a new dimension to you.

53:26.504 --> 53:27.910
That's Lloyd's doing.

53:27.945 --> 53:29.210
Is it Greek?

53:29.246 --> 53:31.978
Oh, now they were
a weird bunch.

53:32.013 --> 53:36.045
Did you know they actually
encouraged the army
to sleep together?

53:36.754 --> 53:38.254
Homosexuals.

53:38.289 --> 53:40.516
Protecting your lover,
not your colleague.

53:40.552 --> 53:41.750
Speaking from experience?

53:41.786 --> 53:44.886
No, just a point
of understanding.

53:44.921 --> 53:47.521
I guess fags are good
for some things.

53:47.557 --> 53:48.557
Like decorating.

53:48.593 --> 53:50.025
Yes, well, yes,

53:50.060 --> 53:52.201
I guess we don't appreciate
the little queers

53:52.236 --> 53:54.735
nearly as much as we should.

53:54.771 --> 53:55.999
Oh!

53:58.474 --> 54:01.912
And it worked,
they defeated the Spartans.

54:01.947 --> 54:03.212
That's absolutely frightening.

54:03.247 --> 54:05.706
Don't worry,
you'll get your turn.

54:35.343 --> 54:37.315
He's making a fool of himself.

54:38.645 --> 54:40.978
You like to be in control,
don't you?

54:42.119 --> 54:45.212
We're equal in that, you and I.

54:45.247 --> 54:50.327
Impossible, there's
a natural order to things.

54:50.362 --> 54:52.387
So, that's what you learned
in medical school?

54:52.422 --> 54:54.332
In life.

54:57.499 --> 55:01.636
Truthfully,
what you've chosen...

55:03.040 --> 55:04.903
I admire you for it.

55:08.672 --> 55:10.406
It must be difficult.

55:10.442 --> 55:11.473
That's private.

55:11.508 --> 55:12.943
Oh, come on.

55:12.978 --> 55:15.409
It's not as though
we're at the Club.

55:15.445 --> 55:18.184
If you can't
open up to a psychiatrist,
who can you trust?

55:18.219 --> 55:19.483
I don't know you.

55:19.519 --> 55:22.751
Mmm. Through affiliation.

55:22.786 --> 55:25.821
Thank God for Uncle Bertram.

55:25.857 --> 55:28.923
I take it
you're close with him?

55:28.959 --> 55:32.733
Yes.
He's been supportive of us.

55:37.041 --> 55:39.674
Mmm. More than you know.

55:41.203 --> 55:43.876
I'm starting to understand
the attraction.

55:53.926 --> 55:55.921
I can see his potential.

55:56.994 --> 55:58.456
I hate that word.

55:58.492 --> 56:01.795
Oh. It's a beautiful word.

56:02.825 --> 56:04.132
He's enough as he is.

56:04.168 --> 56:07.069
Hmm. No one's ever enough.

56:25.013 --> 56:27.753
Oh! Got a wild side.

56:27.788 --> 56:30.487
Well, it's not all
"Teacups and Tulips".

56:30.522 --> 56:31.552
Stop being awful!

56:31.588 --> 56:33.496
Oh, pish.

56:33.531 --> 56:35.158
-You know, Tom,
if I was a painter...
-Yes?

56:35.193 --> 56:39.433
...I'd paint something
strong and bold. Fiery, even.

56:39.468 --> 56:42.105
-You know what that means?
-No?

56:42.140 --> 56:44.932
Nobody likes a know-it-all, Tom.

56:44.968 --> 56:46.839
Don't be jealous.

56:46.875 --> 56:49.447
You should save
the heavy stuff for Lloyd,

56:49.482 --> 56:53.214
I'm tired of thinking tonight.
I'm just a painter.

56:53.250 --> 56:54.876
Well, I am an artist too.

56:54.912 --> 56:57.018
No, you are an author.

56:57.053 --> 56:58.251
Same thing.

57:01.126 --> 57:03.285
I speak both
our languages.

57:05.623 --> 57:06.690
What about mine?

57:06.725 --> 57:07.930
-Which is?
-Bitch.

57:12.799 --> 57:15.802
I'm, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

57:15.838 --> 57:18.073
We haven't had this much fun
in quite some time.

57:18.108 --> 57:21.144
It's the drink.
-I might have been
wrong about you...

57:21.179 --> 57:23.103
-Thomas.
-...you do belong.

57:23.139 --> 57:24.145
we should get going.

57:24.180 --> 57:25.143
But we're dancing.

57:25.179 --> 57:26.883
Now!

57:26.918 --> 57:28.109
Only child.

57:28.144 --> 57:31.982
I knew it! Universe. Lizzie.

57:32.018 --> 57:34.748
Does anyone want
some more sherry?

57:34.784 --> 57:36.627
Oh, Liz, stay.

57:36.662 --> 57:39.057
You're right, okay?
This evening's a waste
of our time.

57:42.196 --> 57:43.358
Liz?

57:45.004 --> 57:45.999
She's moved.

57:46.035 --> 57:47.101
Liz?

57:47.136 --> 57:48.564
I have work.

57:48.600 --> 57:49.600
Liz?

57:49.635 --> 57:51.433
We have a life to plan.

57:51.469 --> 57:52.510
Oh.

57:54.979 --> 57:56.977
Oh, jeez.

57:57.013 --> 57:58.076
Oh.

58:25.036 --> 58:27.302
-Does this hurt?

58:27.337 --> 58:29.971
-Yes!
-Ah, it's rather
swollen.

58:30.007 --> 58:34.343
Oh! He is burning up.

58:35.680 --> 58:38.713
Mom? The ice?

58:40.487 --> 58:44.620
Oh. There, there.

58:44.656 --> 58:49.229
Oh. Relax. Hmm?

58:49.265 --> 58:51.426
The... The...

58:52.929 --> 58:54.429
The floor is moving.

59:06.110 --> 59:07.948
-Teddy!

59:10.386 --> 59:11.655
Do you feel it?

59:12.751 --> 59:14.148
What's he talking about?

59:14.184 --> 59:16.726
He's lightheaded,
from the shock.

59:18.420 --> 59:22.391
The room is pulsing,
do you see the violet?

59:22.426 --> 59:26.060
Lloyd, you shouldn't have kept
refilling his glass.

59:26.095 --> 59:27.866
-Teddy!
-Get away!

59:27.901 --> 59:29.098
-Stay away!
-Teddy!

59:29.133 --> 59:30.734
Don't come any closer,
I'll scream.

59:30.769 --> 59:32.335
He won't come for you.

59:33.541 --> 59:34.706
Of course they will.

59:34.741 --> 59:36.408
They never leave the house.

59:40.981 --> 59:44.388
They only bring others
into their world,

59:44.423 --> 59:46.921
he gets scared
when he comes into mine.

59:52.154 --> 59:53.763
What are you still doing here?

59:56.596 --> 59:58.130
He has my teddy.

1:00:01.137 --> 1:00:02.167
Get up.

1:00:09.842 --> 1:00:11.781
What do you see Dr. Burke for?

1:00:13.812 --> 1:00:16.079
I mean, you're young.

1:00:16.115 --> 1:00:18.951
Well... when the religion
didn't work,

1:00:18.986 --> 1:00:21.725
my parents thought
therapy might.

1:00:23.326 --> 1:00:24.618
You're queer.

1:00:28.629 --> 1:00:29.997
I'm not disgusting.

1:00:39.969 --> 1:00:41.470
Have you taken it?

1:00:42.610 --> 1:00:46.574
That... lysergic acid?

1:00:47.150 --> 1:00:48.477
Mm-hmm.

1:00:53.115 --> 1:00:54.483
What's it feel like?

1:00:56.689 --> 1:00:58.058
Can't you see it?

1:01:04.300 --> 1:01:05.868
See what?

1:01:08.471 --> 1:01:10.097
Do you see it?

1:01:10.132 --> 1:01:11.272
You're going to show me.

1:01:12.310 --> 1:01:13.775
Barb, we'll be fine.

1:01:13.811 --> 1:01:16.773
I am not having
this conversation again.

1:01:16.808 --> 1:01:19.442
If he doesn't want to finish,
he can figure it out
on his own, Carol.

1:01:21.382 --> 1:01:26.117
Did you hear your father?
He has a good point,
doesn't he?

1:01:26.152 --> 1:01:28.782
Should we call for help?

1:01:28.817 --> 1:01:32.692
Don't be ridiculous,
it's just a sprained ankle.

1:01:32.727 --> 1:01:35.024
I've got some pain killers.

1:01:35.059 --> 1:01:37.163
There you go, there you go.

1:01:37.198 --> 1:01:38.896
-What's wrong
with you?

1:01:38.931 --> 1:01:41.233
I've got him now.

1:01:41.268 --> 1:01:45.941
He needs a doctor.
Not a psychiatrist.

1:01:50.549 --> 1:01:53.350
We can't go inside,
he has company.

1:01:53.385 --> 1:01:55.682
I... I'm not going back there.

1:01:55.718 --> 1:01:58.654
It'll be fun, I promise.
Come on.

1:01:58.689 --> 1:02:03.057
I know. Sweetie,
I... I am, I'm present.

1:02:08.558 --> 1:02:10.197
Are you sure there
isn't something I can do?

1:02:10.232 --> 1:02:12.495
I'm on the phone, Mom.

1:02:13.271 --> 1:02:15.705
Relax, sweetie.

1:02:15.741 --> 1:02:18.273
Surely,
shouldn't I be looking...

1:02:18.308 --> 1:02:20.842
Please, Mom.

1:02:20.878 --> 1:02:22.877
<i> ...and you're</i>
<i>not even listening!</i>

1:02:22.913 --> 1:02:24.709
<i>You're never present,</i>
<i>I don't even think</i>

1:02:24.744 --> 1:02:27.048
Lunch. At the Club, tomorrow.
-<i> you know what</i>
<i>I look like anymore.</i>

1:02:27.083 --> 1:02:29.083
-<i> Can I just talk to Dad?</i>
-We'll finalize it then.

1:02:29.981 --> 1:02:33.252
No, he's busy.

1:02:37.660 --> 1:02:39.258
I hope he'll be all right.

1:02:39.294 --> 1:02:42.030
Oh, he'll be fine.
Lloyd's a doctor.

1:02:48.934 --> 1:02:53.305
It's here, and around.

1:02:56.404 --> 1:02:57.379
They'll see you!

1:02:57.414 --> 1:02:58.610
This is paradise.

1:02:58.646 --> 1:03:01.249
You're insane.

1:03:01.285 --> 1:03:02.917
I'm free.

1:03:02.952 --> 1:03:06.954
Come on, come on.
You've got to go home.

1:03:06.989 --> 1:03:08.859
Don't you want to know
what it feels like?

1:03:29.140 --> 1:03:30.848
You can't have it both ways.

1:04:10.589 --> 1:04:12.884
Just lay yourself down.

1:04:22.526 --> 1:04:28.037
It's all around us.
Right here.

1:04:30.535 --> 1:04:33.537
I knew I'd get you
back on the sofa.

1:04:34.911 --> 1:04:40.082
Do you see?
It's here, isn't it?

1:04:53.898 --> 1:04:55.565
Do you think
something's wrong with me?

1:04:55.601 --> 1:04:58.100
Nothing we can't fix.

1:05:11.714 --> 1:05:13.082
He doesn't love her.

1:05:21.592 --> 1:05:23.092
He said he'd choose me.

1:05:25.060 --> 1:05:27.965
I'm sorry,
but he's hedging his bet.

1:05:31.269 --> 1:05:32.365
Mm-mm.

1:05:34.439 --> 1:05:35.603
He's married.

1:05:35.638 --> 1:05:37.106
So what?

1:05:49.511 --> 1:05:51.351
He told me I was just like him,

1:05:52.924 --> 1:05:55.685
the big ol' shadow
of birdie mountain.

1:05:56.792 --> 1:05:57.924
Hey, what did you say?

1:05:57.959 --> 1:05:59.587
-A little birdie.
-Birdie?

1:05:59.622 --> 1:06:01.223
Hmm, a little birdie
told a story.

1:06:01.258 --> 1:06:02.491
Are you saying Bertram?

1:06:02.527 --> 1:06:04.831
He said that
it may have been long ago,

1:06:04.866 --> 1:06:06.333
but that it felt good.

1:06:14.007 --> 1:06:16.409
A tortured man.

1:06:17.482 --> 1:06:19.814
A secret lover.

1:06:19.850 --> 1:06:23.251
It's been no fairy tale.

1:06:24.216 --> 1:06:25.715
Why would you write this?

1:06:26.724 --> 1:06:30.425
They made me change my book.

1:06:30.460 --> 1:06:35.491
I had no choice, I had to
come up with something new
and...

1:06:35.526 --> 1:06:37.527
You're not making this
easy for me.

1:06:37.563 --> 1:06:43.337
I don't know why I...
You know... don't you?

1:06:44.500 --> 1:06:46.241
I know it's not your story.

1:06:47.907 --> 1:06:49.436
Now tell me.

1:06:49.471 --> 1:06:51.681
He talked about love,

1:06:51.716 --> 1:06:55.180
their good omen, an albatross.

1:06:55.216 --> 1:06:56.619
I didn't know
it was about you.

1:06:56.655 --> 1:06:58.418
Tell me Bertram's version.

1:07:06.893 --> 1:07:08.065
Put it on.

1:08:03.821 --> 1:08:05.353
I didn't want to steal it.

1:08:09.051 --> 1:08:11.821
Now, tell it to me
the way Bertram told it to you.

1:08:25.435 --> 1:08:27.540
Tell me what you see.

1:08:42.484 --> 1:08:47.825
Let me not to the marriage
of true minds admit impediments.

1:08:47.860 --> 1:08:52.496
Love is not love which alters
when it alteration finds,

1:08:52.531 --> 1:08:54.732
or bends with the remover
to remove.

1:08:56.807 --> 1:09:03.074
Oh, no! It is an ever-fixed mark
that looks on tempests
and is never shaken.

1:09:08.610 --> 1:09:09.978
Isn't it mesmerizing?

1:09:13.124 --> 1:09:15.082
He's just waiting to die.

1:09:17.886 --> 1:09:19.856
Who would kill
such a beautiful thing?

1:09:31.500 --> 1:09:33.005
Are you happy now?

1:09:33.041 --> 1:09:37.038
Not yet. Keep going.

1:09:40.175 --> 1:09:44.584
I was so worried
you wouldn't come.
Are you sure?

1:10:10.706 --> 1:10:12.508
That's not how it happened.

1:10:12.543 --> 1:10:14.008
What do you want me to say?

1:10:14.044 --> 1:10:17.210
We weren't alone.
He should have told you that.

1:10:35.971 --> 1:10:37.065
It's mesmerizing.

1:10:39.141 --> 1:10:41.476
He's just waiting to die.

1:10:43.213 --> 1:10:46.811
Who would kill
such a beautiful thing?

1:10:51.785 --> 1:10:54.084
-Go deeper.
-I don't know
what you want to hear.

1:10:54.120 --> 1:10:55.149
The truth.

1:10:56.422 --> 1:10:58.658
Well, tell me your version.

1:10:59.788 --> 1:11:00.897
It's not how I remember it.

1:11:00.932 --> 1:11:02.497
-Then what hap--

1:11:05.737 --> 1:11:06.765
I'm trying...

1:11:08.268 --> 1:11:09.999
I'm trying to remember.

1:11:13.778 --> 1:11:17.006
It felt good.

1:11:21.279 --> 1:11:22.880
It feels...

1:11:27.284 --> 1:11:29.183
so good.

1:12:01.549 --> 1:12:02.755
Not now.

1:12:14.234 --> 1:12:16.773
-Lloyd?
-Hmm?

1:12:16.808 --> 1:12:18.640
You've got class.

1:12:18.676 --> 1:12:19.871
So?

1:12:35.987 --> 1:12:38.428
These really are very beautiful,

1:12:40.691 --> 1:12:43.092
expressive lines and form.

1:12:44.330 --> 1:12:45.633
She's got talent.

1:12:47.598 --> 1:12:48.801
Yeah, she's all right.

1:12:52.076 --> 1:12:53.976
When will you talk with her?

1:12:54.011 --> 1:12:55.412
It's not the right time.

1:12:57.748 --> 1:12:59.045
When?

1:12:59.080 --> 1:13:00.417
After exams.

1:13:31.280 --> 1:13:33.142
I want you to let it carry you.

1:13:44.561 --> 1:13:49.026
Spoiled brat!
You will ruin your life, Ethan!

1:13:51.463 --> 1:13:54.537
<i> ...time.</i>
<i>And for the hundredth time,</i>
<i>I'm dropping out.</i>

1:13:54.573 --> 1:13:57.307
<i>I don't want to do it.</i>
<i>This is what's best for me,</i>

1:13:57.342 --> 1:13:59.267
<i>and if you can't</i>
<i>understand that then,</i>

1:14:00.239 --> 1:14:01.478
<i>Mom?</i>

1:14:02.175 --> 1:14:03.705
<i>Mother?</i>

1:14:03.740 --> 1:14:05.271
<i>Are you even there?</i>

1:14:05.306 --> 1:14:07.847
<i>Are you even listening to me</i>
<i>any more?</i>

1:14:08.478 --> 1:14:10.115
<i>Mom?</i>

1:14:10.150 --> 1:14:11.180
<i>Hello?</i>

1:14:12.757 --> 1:14:13.787
<i>Mother?</i>

1:14:53.392 --> 1:14:54.487
Trust me?

1:14:56.131 --> 1:14:57.259
Of course.

1:15:29.165 --> 1:15:30.693
Dear?

1:15:30.728 --> 1:15:31.799
-Stay here.
-Mmm.

1:15:48.547 --> 1:15:49.916
Everything okay?

1:15:50.880 --> 1:15:53.379
-Lloyd?

1:15:53.414 --> 1:15:55.422
-We're in session.

1:15:55.458 --> 1:15:57.852
Open the door, Lloyd.

1:16:05.127 --> 1:16:07.164
Do you hear the music?

1:16:09.898 --> 1:16:10.970
Mmm.

1:16:14.705 --> 1:16:15.975
It's distant.

1:16:17.983 --> 1:16:19.440
Let's go back.

1:16:22.082 --> 1:16:25.246
Weary with toil,
I haste me to my bed.

1:16:25.282 --> 1:16:28.182
The dear repose for limbs
with travel tired;

1:16:28.218 --> 1:16:30.724
but then begins a journey
in my head,

1:16:30.759 --> 1:16:34.695
to work my mind,
when body's work's expired:

1:16:34.731 --> 1:16:37.400
for then my thoughts,
from far where I abide,

1:16:37.435 --> 1:16:40.802
intend a zealous pilgrimage
to thee,

1:16:43.332 --> 1:16:46.707
and keep my drooping eyelids
open wide,

1:16:46.742 --> 1:16:50.578
looking on darkness
which the blind do see:

1:16:50.613 --> 1:16:52.880
save that my soul's
imaginary sight.

1:16:55.113 --> 1:16:57.751
Presents thy shadow
to my sightless view,

1:16:57.786 --> 1:17:00.923
which, like a jewel
hung in ghastly night...

1:17:01.952 --> 1:17:03.919
Lloyd? Dear?

1:17:03.955 --> 1:17:05.327
Just a minute.

1:17:05.362 --> 1:17:07.321
-Time to hide.
-Not again.

1:17:07.356 --> 1:17:09.124
-I'll tell her, I promise.
-Don't do this,

1:17:09.159 --> 1:17:10.894
don't hang the albatross
around my neck.

1:17:10.930 --> 1:17:11.993
I can't watch you
being with her.

1:17:12.028 --> 1:17:13.703
Just get in the fucking closet.

1:17:30.277 --> 1:17:32.113
You look a mess,

1:17:32.149 --> 1:17:33.485
what will
your professors think?

1:17:33.521 --> 1:17:34.548
Sorry.

1:17:35.687 --> 1:17:37.854
Some brain power.

1:17:52.972 --> 1:17:55.610
Was he here again?

1:17:55.645 --> 1:17:58.572
He says your art
is rather expressive.

1:17:59.810 --> 1:18:00.948
You've got talent.

1:18:02.715 --> 1:18:03.852
Really?

1:18:06.989 --> 1:18:11.151
Why are we waiting,
all of my friends are married.

1:18:11.186 --> 1:18:14.357
Because we are avant-garde.

1:18:41.059 --> 1:18:42.121
Trust me?

1:18:45.261 --> 1:18:46.422
Of course.

1:19:10.244 --> 1:19:11.585
-What was that?
-Boom!

1:19:11.620 --> 1:19:13.722
I shouldn't have stayed, my--

1:19:13.758 --> 1:19:15.215
-No, no, no don't leave.
-My husband's in there.

1:19:15.250 --> 1:19:16.619
I can't be taking care of you.

1:19:16.655 --> 1:19:18.117
Just stay.

1:19:18.153 --> 1:19:19.587
What if he needs me?

1:19:21.665 --> 1:19:23.794
I don't think
you need a therapist,

1:19:23.830 --> 1:19:25.527
I think you need a friend.

1:19:32.333 --> 1:19:35.641
Lloyd, dear. Can I come in?

1:19:38.676 --> 1:19:39.981
Thomas!

1:19:42.912 --> 1:19:44.216
Dr. Burke?

1:19:47.751 --> 1:19:48.891
Hello?

1:19:58.630 --> 1:20:00.666
Thomas?

1:20:00.701 --> 1:20:02.036
Is everyone all right?

1:20:09.478 --> 1:20:10.539
Uh...

1:20:14.352 --> 1:20:16.150
Please don't be angry.

1:20:16.185 --> 1:20:21.151
I know I shouldn't have,
I don't know what
came over me.

1:20:21.186 --> 1:20:25.692
It's just
you have no self control.

1:20:25.727 --> 1:20:28.023
What's going on, I heard a gun?

1:20:28.058 --> 1:20:29.360
-You're soaked!
-Where--

1:20:31.201 --> 1:20:32.928
Thomas?

1:20:32.963 --> 1:20:34.470
We're going home.

1:20:34.505 --> 1:20:38.699
Do you feel it? Do you feel it?

1:20:42.336 --> 1:20:43.671
What did you do to him?

1:20:44.514 --> 1:20:45.712
Just a little therapy.

1:20:45.747 --> 1:20:47.482
My husband isn't your patient.

1:20:47.518 --> 1:20:49.545
He is now. Sprained ankle.

1:20:52.850 --> 1:20:55.315
You're sick.

1:20:55.350 --> 1:20:58.895
Now, Thomas. We need to go home.

1:20:59.926 --> 1:21:01.489
We should never have come here.

1:21:01.524 --> 1:21:04.530
I'm right on the cusp,
don't you see it?

1:21:04.565 --> 1:21:06.000
You're high.

1:21:06.035 --> 1:21:09.532
That's why he's so close,
why we're so close.

1:21:11.841 --> 1:21:15.472
I know the ending,
I see the ending.

1:21:17.944 --> 1:21:20.873
Hmm. He's been holding it in.

1:21:22.619 --> 1:21:23.851
But he wants to let it out.

1:21:23.886 --> 1:21:27.314
Enough of your psychiatric
bullshit!

1:21:27.349 --> 1:21:29.123
I know who killed the albatross.

1:21:34.732 --> 1:21:36.493
She didn't take away
your good omen.

1:21:41.403 --> 1:21:43.467
Me?

1:21:44.641 --> 1:21:47.438
Lloyd, what's he talking about?

1:21:49.642 --> 1:21:50.609
Lloyd?

1:21:50.644 --> 1:21:52.239
She didn't.

1:21:52.274 --> 1:21:53.950
It wasn't Carol.

1:21:56.984 --> 1:21:57.946
We're going home.

1:21:57.982 --> 1:21:59.522
Shut up, Liz.

1:21:59.557 --> 1:22:02.588
Don't tell her to shut-- aw!

1:22:06.654 --> 1:22:08.690
What's he going on about, Lloyd?

1:22:10.292 --> 1:22:11.693
Taking a good omen?

1:22:13.100 --> 1:22:16.630
Everything's fine, isn't it,
Lloyd?

1:22:16.665 --> 1:22:22.404
Bertram. Bertram
was the love of your life.

1:22:22.439 --> 1:22:26.482
Bertie?
Your book is about Bertram?

1:22:26.517 --> 1:22:28.584
Get out of here!

1:22:28.619 --> 1:22:30.783
Lloyd, what did you tell him?

1:22:30.818 --> 1:22:32.312
Get out of here.

1:22:32.348 --> 1:22:34.215
They don't have to leave.

1:22:34.250 --> 1:22:36.056
Out of here!

1:22:36.091 --> 1:22:38.617
They're just friends.
Boys will be boys.

1:22:38.652 --> 1:22:39.828
It doesn't matter.

1:22:39.863 --> 1:22:41.159
It's monkey business,
that's all.

1:22:41.194 --> 1:22:43.092
-Get out of my house.
-Please.

1:22:43.127 --> 1:22:44.792
None of this matters.

1:22:48.198 --> 1:22:49.500
You don't have to go.

1:22:55.876 --> 1:22:59.504
Why did you have to?

1:22:59.540 --> 1:23:01.710
It was just a little fun.

1:23:15.633 --> 1:23:17.693
I've given you everything.

1:23:19.900 --> 1:23:23.270
Yes.

1:23:26.477 --> 1:23:27.835
Yes, you have.

1:23:34.244 --> 1:23:36.184
But this isn't charity.

1:23:54.571 --> 1:23:59.298
Hey, hey. Hey!

1:23:59.333 --> 1:24:00.604
I love you.

1:24:02.504 --> 1:24:04.810
How am I going to get you home?

1:24:04.845 --> 1:24:05.939
Don't you feel it?

1:24:11.114 --> 1:24:12.154
It's there,

1:24:14.448 --> 1:24:15.423
coming towards us.

1:24:15.458 --> 1:24:16.587
It's...

1:24:17.793 --> 1:24:19.392
It's passing through me.

1:24:21.058 --> 1:24:22.058
It's in me.

1:24:22.093 --> 1:24:24.091
Thomas, hey, hey!

1:24:24.126 --> 1:24:28.665
It's not in this house,
it's not in this house,
it's out there.

1:24:31.808 --> 1:24:34.506
It's-- It's... It's here.

1:24:40.144 --> 1:24:41.348
There you are.

1:24:43.278 --> 1:24:44.483
Here we are.

1:24:48.920 --> 1:24:49.950
Really?

1:24:54.324 --> 1:24:55.824
Why didn't you tell me?

1:24:57.162 --> 1:24:58.629
I'm telling you now.

1:25:04.331 --> 1:25:06.032
A baby?

1:25:08.605 --> 1:25:10.674
-We're having a baby?
-Yeah.

1:25:12.243 --> 1:25:14.381
You scared them away.

1:25:18.252 --> 1:25:20.189
Bertie is never
going to forgive me.

1:25:21.659 --> 1:25:24.256
Tonight was a disaster.

1:25:24.291 --> 1:25:26.228
I thought it
was rather successful.

1:25:27.459 --> 1:25:30.160
I wanted so badly
to impress her.

1:25:30.196 --> 1:25:33.895
Then you better go talk to her.
Invite her to the Club,
or whatever it is you do.

1:25:33.931 --> 1:25:37.770
How can I?
You've practically
traumatized my mother.

1:25:42.972 --> 1:25:45.072
I'm sure that Bertie will never
take another one.

1:25:45.107 --> 1:25:48.477
-Calm down,
before you have a stroke.

1:25:48.513 --> 1:25:51.080
Not after
what you did to Thomas.

1:25:51.116 --> 1:25:52.188
Couldn't help.

1:25:59.624 --> 1:26:02.198
I'll deal with our boy
once and for all.

1:26:05.670 --> 1:26:07.731
Liz, wait.

1:26:09.532 --> 1:26:11.867
Listen to me, you little shit.

1:26:13.237 --> 1:26:16.036
Uh, Bertram. Uh...

1:26:16.844 --> 1:26:18.944
Um... yeah.

1:26:18.980 --> 1:26:21.684
Liz, Liz. Liz! Liz!

1:26:21.719 --> 1:26:24.385
I'm sorry!

1:26:25.148 --> 1:26:26.453
Lizzie!

1:26:27.858 --> 1:26:30.721
Don't let Tom write about this.

1:26:32.486 --> 1:26:34.296
Elizabeth!

1:26:38.192 --> 1:26:41.564
-You can't drive my car.
-Should have taken yours.

1:26:41.599 --> 1:26:44.000
Shut up, Thomas.
Give me the damn keys.

1:26:44.036 --> 1:26:45.373
I love us.

1:26:48.736 --> 1:26:52.941
Please, wait! Please! Wait.

1:26:55.018 --> 1:26:56.482
We've had enough.

1:26:56.518 --> 1:26:59.918
I'm sure
I can get you into the Club!

1:26:59.954 --> 1:27:03.154
Wait, please...

1:27:03.190 --> 1:27:06.059
Liz, Liz, Liz! I'm sorry.

1:27:06.094 --> 1:27:08.627
-Elizabeth!

1:27:11.794 --> 1:27:16.734
Mom liked you, I'm sure.
Aren't you?

1:27:21.969 --> 1:27:25.974
You won't write about us,
will you?

1:28:36.545 --> 1:28:37.914
I'm sorry.

1:28:41.054 --> 1:28:42.721
Oh, my boy.

1:28:44.653 --> 1:28:46.923
Where are your clothes?

1:29:25.265 --> 1:29:26.930
Have you seen my teddy?

1:30:10.375 --> 1:30:12.613
Please, Bertram,

1:30:14.743 --> 1:30:16.485
why are you doing this?

1:30:18.915 --> 1:30:20.687
<i>You shouldn't ask that.</i>

1:30:22.090 --> 1:30:23.921
<i>You were there.</i>

1:30:34.096 --> 1:30:37.000
<i>This is how</i>
<i>you chose to have me.</i>

1:30:39.342 --> 1:30:43.479
I was young,
I didn't have a choice.

1:30:44.475 --> 1:30:46.542
<i>We were happy,</i>

1:30:46.577 --> 1:30:48.517
<i>could've been happy.</i>

1:30:51.649 --> 1:30:54.748
<i>You had fallen down a well,</i>

1:30:54.783 --> 1:30:58.453
<i>-and when I threw you a rope,</i>
<i>you chose to struggle.</i>

1:30:59.996 --> 1:31:02.025
<i>You chose her.</i>

1:31:03.993 --> 1:31:05.831
<i>What did you think</i>
<i>would happen?</i>

1:31:11.635 --> 1:31:13.509
<i>He was mesmerizing,</i>

1:31:15.540 --> 1:31:17.270
<i>but you were too scared.</i>

1:31:17.306 --> 1:31:19.104
No, no!
You don't have to do this!

1:31:19.140 --> 1:31:21.478
-Please! Don't shoot it!

1:31:38.335 --> 1:31:40.833
I had almost forgotten
what I'd done.

1:31:51.181 --> 1:31:52.944
I'll make sure you never do.

1:31:59.821 --> 1:32:01.755
<i>I couldn't fall in there</i>
<i>with you.</i>

1:32:03.593 --> 1:32:06.356
<i>Let you drag me</i>
<i>away from myself to drown.</i>

1:32:09.265 --> 1:32:11.457
<i>It didn't have to be like this.</i>

1:32:29.113 --> 1:32:34.748
Operator, I'd like
to place a call to Boston.

1:32:34.784 --> 1:32:36.591
My son, Ethan Burke.

1:32:36.627 --> 1:32:38.286
<i>Please hold</i>
<i>while I put you through.</i>

1:32:39.755 --> 1:32:41.160
<i>Connecting.</i>

1:32:43.533 --> 1:32:47.502
Her art no longer has a voice.

1:32:49.439 --> 1:32:51.332
I've made sure of that.

1:32:55.980 --> 1:32:59.280
Never floral.

1:32:59.315 --> 1:33:01.109
When we finish,

1:33:01.144 --> 1:33:04.110
I want you to make her
a warm pot of tea

1:33:04.146 --> 1:33:07.018
and tell her
I'll buy a few more.

1:33:12.392 --> 1:33:14.928
Oh, Mom. I'm sor--

1:33:14.963 --> 1:33:18.997
Oh, dear, no, no, no. Stop,
no apologies. We must finish.

1:33:21.498 --> 1:33:22.466
<i>Carol?</i>

1:33:22.502 --> 1:33:26.640
So, lunch, tomorrow.

1:33:26.675 --> 1:33:29.437
Yes, yes.
But I want to run this by you.

1:33:29.472 --> 1:33:36.247
What do you think of seating
the Greens with the Bakers?

1:33:36.282 --> 1:33:39.985
You and I, we-- we torture
each other from afar.

1:33:48.659 --> 1:33:50.661
What a night.

1:33:50.696 --> 1:33:52.162
Tell me about it.

1:33:54.304 --> 1:33:56.070
My head is still spinning.

1:35:04.941 --> 1:35:07.039
<i>Who would kill</i>
<i>such a beautiful thing?</i>

1:35:19.282 --> 1:35:21.188
We're going to be
all right, Liz.

1:35:21.224 --> 1:35:22.758
Are you sure?

1:35:32.861 --> 1:35:34.902
Absolutely.

1:35:38.242 --> 1:35:40.006
I know how it ends.
