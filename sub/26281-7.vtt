Coming back to California
and moving in with you,

00:05.306 --> 00:08.442
it's been harder
than I anticipated.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.578
Hershey meant
everything to me, Shaun.

for anorexia treatment here.

a real option.

My wife's decided against
the valve-repair surgery,

the deep brain stimulation.

a part of the surgery.

03:30.478 --> 03:33.046

a year ago.

03:33.113 --> 03:36.149
She's had six cycles
of Carbo-Taxol

extending through
her diaphragm

03:55.769 --> 03:58.138

of her pain.

03:58.205 --> 04:00.708
Her surgeon has ruled out
removing it

04:00.774 --> 04:02.376
due to vascular complexity.

04:02.443 --> 04:06.647
But I think laparoscopic

12:13.400 --> 12:17.237
Ooh!
You want some pirate booty
and a juice box with that?

12:17.304 --> 12:18.772
(LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)

12:18.839 --> 12:20.640
You keep me waiting
for hours on end.

12:20.707 --> 12:22.009
Now at least
I have something to do.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.376
Cancer is keeping
you waiting.

12:23.443 --> 12:25.979
Yeah.
We're ready for you.

12:26.046 --> 12:28.615
Here you go.
Oh, you can keep that.

12:28.681 --> 12:30.183
Oh. Oh, thank you.

12:31.051 --> 12:32.252
Bye.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.889
That story is not gonna
end well, is it?

12:35.956 --> 12:37.791
Mmm.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.793
You know, the yo-yo

12:39.860 --> 12:42.495

since ancient China.
Watch this.

my only patient.

12:48.535 --> 12:51.905
Remembering and executing
these tricks

12:51.972 --> 12:54.441

my sequential memory

12:54.507 --> 12:56.543
and protect my brain
against your radiation.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.545
With this
new targeted therapy,
I can better focus

12:58.611 --> 13:01.815
on just knocking
the things out of your
head that I want to.

13:01.882 --> 13:04.284
Of course I'm also
making a little wish list

13:04.351 --> 13:05.986
about other things I might
want to get rid of.

13:16.463 --> 13:20.467
Whether it's tomorrow
or a few months from now,
Dash is gonna lose me.

13:21.768 --> 13:23.236
And he'll be devastated.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.772
He's an amazing,
loving husband.

13:29.076 --> 13:30.477
I want you
to go out with him.

13:31.244 --> 13:33.513
(LAUGHING)
What?

13:33.580 --> 13:36.116
You two get along.
You even have chemistry.

13:37.117 --> 13:39.052
No. We're friends.

13:39.119 --> 13:40.888
If Dash is gonna move on
with his life,

13:40.954 --> 13:42.622
he needs something
to live for.

13:42.689 --> 13:44.091
I think that could be you.

You're a perfect match.

Great.
We just need you to
sign the consent forms.

14:17.790 --> 14:21.061
Donation carries
several risks,

14:21.128 --> 14:24.264
including blood clots,
infection, hemorrhage,

14:24.331 --> 14:27.100
lung collapse,
and possibly death.

14:27.167 --> 14:30.537
There are also lifelong risks,
such as high blood pressure,

14:30.603 --> 14:32.205
which can cause
a heart attack,

14:32.272 --> 14:34.407
and protein-losing
nephropathy,

14:34.474 --> 14:35.909
which can impair
your remaining kidney,

14:35.976 --> 14:38.145
leading to the need for
a transplant yourself.

14:41.681 --> 14:42.849
It's a big ask.

14:42.916 --> 14:44.384
Yes, it is.

14:49.356 --> 14:51.891
I'm happy to sign the forms
on one condition.

We're not taking
that offer.

15:01.201 --> 15:03.270
Either sell or buy me out
at the same price.

15:03.336 --> 15:04.571
You know I can't
afford that.

15:04.637 --> 15:06.106
I can't afford anything.

Look, Dad left you
in charge,

15:07.574 --> 15:10.043
but all of my money
is tied up in it.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.578
I got investment
opportunities.

15:11.644 --> 15:13.446
I got things that
I'm excited about.

15:13.513 --> 15:16.183
Dad left me in charge because
when things got tough,

15:16.249 --> 15:18.285
you took off to college
while we rebuilt.

15:18.351 --> 15:21.321
And now you want
to cash in?
We'll both cash in.

15:21.388 --> 15:23.756
The deal I negotiated
is way over-market.

15:23.823 --> 15:25.825
I don't care how
good the deal is.

15:25.892 --> 15:28.828
I like what I do.
And I like my kidney.

15:28.895 --> 15:31.131
It seems we both need
to make a sacrifice.

I told her not to do that.

16:36.563 --> 16:38.131
You've been married
to her eight years.

16:38.198 --> 16:39.666
You still ask
that question?

16:41.334 --> 16:44.171
Well, we, uh,
do have one other choice.

16:47.574 --> 16:49.742
(BOTH LAUGH)

16:49.809 --> 16:51.578
He's exploiting
this situation.

16:51.644 --> 16:53.513
Yes. He's entitled to.

16:55.182 --> 16:56.783
You don't think
an organ donation

16:56.849 --> 16:58.785
should be an
altruistic act?

16:58.851 --> 17:00.520
Can it be?

17:00.587 --> 17:04.791
A majority of donors do it
to make their own lives
more worthwhile,

17:04.857 --> 17:06.126
and almost
a quarter do it

17:06.193 --> 17:08.328
to relieve guilt
over a past mistake.

17:08.395 --> 17:12.265
Redemption, meaning,
sure, but not money.

17:12.332 --> 17:15.735
So, you never take
an opportunity to get ahead
at someone else's expense?

17:15.802 --> 17:18.438
I'm competing,
not trafficking organs.

17:18.505 --> 17:19.906
I need Armando's kidney.

17:19.972 --> 17:22.542
And I need it without
getting dragged into
their family drama,

17:22.609 --> 17:23.810
which is why
I have residents.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.412
So you two find a way
to make it happen.

This central line will
allow us to monitor your heart

17:33.786 --> 17:37.457
Have you considered
my proposal?

17:37.524 --> 17:42.595
I have been more focused
on your surgery
than seducing your husband.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.331

Typical.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.965
Ah. You got me.

17:46.032 --> 17:49.436
I'm not dating
my cancer-riddled
friend's husband

17:49.502 --> 17:51.104
because I have
commitment issues.

17:51.171 --> 17:53.806
You've been sprinting
away from men
as long as I've known you.

17:53.873 --> 17:55.108
Yeah.

17:55.175 --> 17:57.177

when I have the time.

17:57.244 --> 17:58.811
It will never be
the right time.

17:59.812 --> 18:01.414
You're afraid
to get hurt.

18:04.217 --> 18:06.686
I know how short life is.

18:06.753 --> 18:09.222
I don't want you to miss out
on the best part of it.

All done.

that sounds?

of the man that I love.

18:18.565 --> 18:21.301
Does that sound stupid?
Yes, very, but...

18:23.102 --> 18:24.237
Please.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.838
Please, would you
just drop this?

18:27.440 --> 18:30.243
I will drop this.
If... One date.

18:31.411 --> 18:32.779
One dinner. That's all.

18:32.845 --> 18:36.183
But a real one,
not a latte in the cafe.

18:36.249 --> 18:40.052
I want a real date.
Appetizers, main course,
wine.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.422

No wine. But candles.

18:42.489 --> 18:44.524
I want candles.

18:44.591 --> 18:47.260
One date.
I will never mention
any of this again.

18:50.730 --> 18:53.966
It's a federal crime to
barter a human organ
for anything of value.

18:54.033 --> 18:55.735
I'm not selling
Santiago anything.

18:55.802 --> 18:59.272
You're receiving money
from a third party
in exchange for your kidney.

He's receiving money
from a third party
for his business.

19:02.909 --> 19:03.976
So is his brother.

19:04.043 --> 19:05.678
He should love him
enough to not...

19:05.745 --> 19:07.180
I love him enough
to give him a kidney.

19:07.247 --> 19:08.748
He should love me enough
to accept an offer

19:08.815 --> 19:10.417
that would improve
my life, too.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.685
I mean, it's a much lower
ask than a vital organ.

19:12.752 --> 19:14.454
You're not allowed
to ask for anything.

19:14.521 --> 19:15.555
Are you saying
that if he agrees

19:15.622 --> 19:16.889
you're not gonna
perform the surgery?

19:16.956 --> 19:18.358
He doesn't agree.
He will.

19:18.425 --> 19:19.626
Everything in life
is transactional,

19:19.692 --> 19:21.894
and in this case,
I've got all the leverage.

19:21.961 --> 19:24.997
Leverage?
It's what you have
that they need.

19:25.064 --> 19:27.700
It's how you shift a deal
in your favor.

19:27.767 --> 19:30.237
You guys have no leverage
and no cards to play.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.472
Yes, we do.

19:32.539 --> 19:35.742
I don't believe you're willing
to let your brother die.

19:35.808 --> 19:37.844
A good negotiator
doesn't bluff.

19:37.910 --> 19:39.879
If you cave on a threat,
you lose all credibility.

19:39.946 --> 19:42.382
And Santiago knows
I'm a good negotiator.

19:42.449 --> 19:44.251
So he won't die

19:44.317 --> 19:46.152
precisely because
I'm willing to let him.

19:50.923 --> 19:52.725

39:11.983 --> 39:14.386
And it feels like you're
all alone with it.

39:14.453 --> 39:15.787
(CRYING)
Please, stop.
But you're not.

39:19.458 --> 39:20.692
Dash is here.

39:26.698 --> 39:28.033
So am I.

(KEYBOARD CLACKING)

39:55.360 --> 39:58.263
Thank you for
everything you did.

39:58.329 --> 39:59.397
Of course.

40:00.532 --> 40:04.436
I, um... I meant what
I said to Kayla.

40:04.503 --> 40:07.639
You really are the most
gifted surgeon
I have ever worked with.

40:12.410 --> 40:13.745
You did well today.

40:15.914 --> 40:17.983
Thanks.

40:18.049 --> 40:20.586
I'll report back to
Dr. Lim in the morning
if that's what you want.

40:25.724 --> 40:27.559
Yeah, that's probably
for the best.

40:28.727 --> 40:30.729

40:37.936 --> 40:39.838
Shaun, I don't need
another fish.

40:39.905 --> 40:42.340
I don't want
another fish.
I do.

40:42.407 --> 40:44.009
Our goldfish died.

40:44.075 --> 40:47.145
You need to provide
a replacement.

40:47.212 --> 40:49.380
Store policy...
Once a fish
leaves this store,

40:49.447 --> 40:51.249
all responsibility for
its well-being falls up...

40:51.316 --> 40:56.054
Hubert had
ichthyophthirius
multifiliis,

40:56.121 --> 40:59.958
a common goldfish parasite
picked up in pet stores.

41:03.394 --> 41:07.232
You have no leverage
and no cards to play.

41:29.721 --> 41:31.723
You didn't kill Hubert.

41:32.791 --> 41:34.660
He was defective.

41:35.727 --> 41:37.128
We'll try again.

41:39.264 --> 41:41.332
Thank you, Shaun.

41:44.469 --> 41:47.906
Caring for a fish won't
sort out my problems.

41:47.973 --> 41:50.508
* You pull back your curtains

41:50.576 --> 41:52.510
That one's pretty cute.

41:53.679 --> 41:55.280
* You watch a plane flying

41:55.346 --> 41:58.049
Platies are a very
hardy fish.

41:58.116 --> 42:00.118
They are difficult
to kill.

42:00.185 --> 42:01.553
(LAUGHS)

42:01.620 --> 42:03.955
* This is the day

42:04.022 --> 42:06.992
* Your life will surely change

42:08.059 --> 42:10.562
* This is the day
