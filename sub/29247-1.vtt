WEBVTT

01:21.690 --> 01:23.257
Looks like we're early.

01:26.173 --> 01:27.913
You sure you want to do this?

01:29.176 --> 01:30.414
Don't have to,
if you don't want to.

01:30.438 --> 01:31.830
He was my father.

01:31.874 --> 01:33.354
I know, but it's only been
a few years

01:33.397 --> 01:34.397
since you've known that.

01:36.618 --> 01:38.098
It doesn't matter.

01:39.969 --> 01:41.579
All right.

02:03.775 --> 02:05.908
What is it?

02:12.958 --> 02:13.958
You okay?

02:15.309 --> 02:17.528
I am now.

02:17.572 --> 02:19.922
It's not like when I was here.

02:19.965 --> 02:21.619
Annie, listen.

02:21.663 --> 02:24.144
I'll never let anything
happen to you like that again.

02:24.187 --> 02:25.580
Okay? Ever.

02:25.623 --> 02:27.451
I promise.

02:27.495 --> 02:28.713
You understand me?

02:28.757 --> 02:31.151
Yeah. I know.

02:44.251 --> 02:46.514
That's my grandmother, Leigh.

02:46.557 --> 02:47.993
I need to know
what happened to her.

02:48.037 --> 02:49.734
Has no one been able
to tell you anything?

02:49.778 --> 02:51.214
Nobody knows anything.

02:51.258 --> 02:52.955
Maybe she's just one more

02:52.998 --> 02:55.392
in a long line
of my family's secrets.

03:11.887 --> 03:13.454
Whoa.

03:13.497 --> 03:16.587
Her mother, Jillian,
painted this.

03:16.631 --> 03:18.067
You know, I have a feeling

03:18.110 --> 03:19.764
I wasn't the only one
who suffered here.

03:21.288 --> 03:23.942
But I want to know for sure.

03:23.986 --> 03:26.423
I'll go let the priest
know we've arrived.

03:54.756 --> 03:57.019
Rye Whiskey, it's you!

03:57.062 --> 03:58.020
Miss Annie.

03:58.063 --> 03:59.804
Oh...

03:59.848 --> 04:01.937
it's been a long while,
hasn't it?

04:03.068 --> 04:04.331
And here you are,

04:04.374 --> 04:07.029
looking like
an all grown-up lady,

04:07.072 --> 04:08.596
and fit as a fiddle.

04:08.639 --> 04:10.293
My, my.

04:10.337 --> 04:12.295
It sure is good to see you,

04:12.339 --> 04:15.298
though a shame it's under
such sad circumstances.

04:15.342 --> 04:16.778
It's good to see you, too.

04:16.821 --> 04:19.214
I have something for you.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.652
It belonged
to your grandmother, Leigh.

04:21.696 --> 04:23.219
Are you sure this is for me?

04:23.263 --> 04:24.916
Yes, ma'am.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.831
It's from your father, Troy.

04:26.875 --> 04:29.399
He told me to give it to you,
right before he died.

04:29.443 --> 04:31.967
It's her diary.

04:32.010 --> 04:35.884
My deepest condolences to you
and your family, Miss Annie.

04:35.927 --> 04:37.102
God bless you.

04:37.146 --> 04:38.147
Thank you, Rye.

04:50.812 --> 04:52.683
I'm so happy.

04:52.727 --> 04:55.425
My birthday is finally here,

04:55.469 --> 04:58.646
and my coming-out party
is in just a few days.

04:58.689 --> 05:01.388
Of course, my mother says
that a proper lady

05:01.431 --> 05:02.669
should stop
counting her birthdays

05:02.693 --> 05:04.347
after 28,

05:04.391 --> 05:06.480
but I never will.

05:06.523 --> 05:08.046
I still don't understand

05:08.090 --> 05:09.890
why she thinks birthdays
are nothing but pain,

05:09.918 --> 05:10.919
because, to me,

05:10.962 --> 05:13.225
it's the best day of the year,

05:13.269 --> 05:15.140
even better than Christmas.

05:15.184 --> 05:16.707
Lord, forgive me.

05:16.751 --> 05:18.579
Thank you.

05:24.846 --> 05:28.240
There are so many of them!

05:28.284 --> 05:29.764
Thank you, Papa.

05:31.418 --> 05:32.897
Happy birthday, dear.

05:32.941 --> 05:34.856
Yes, happy birthday, doll.

05:34.899 --> 05:35.900
Thank you.

05:36.945 --> 05:38.860
Leigh...

05:38.903 --> 05:40.905
open that one first.

05:43.734 --> 05:45.867
It's a diary.

05:45.910 --> 05:47.999
Think of it as your own
personal captain's log.

05:48.043 --> 05:49.479
Captain's log?

05:49.523 --> 05:50.963
Yeah, to record
the fantastic journey

05:51.002 --> 05:52.395
of your life, my child.

05:52.439 --> 05:55.050
Yes, Cleave, however,
she's not a child anymore.

05:55.093 --> 05:56.573
She's a young lady.

05:56.617 --> 05:58.270
That's right.

05:58.314 --> 05:59.924
Hmm. Maybe it's time

05:59.968 --> 06:02.536
to start figuring out what
you want to do with your life.

06:02.579 --> 06:05.756
Perhaps go into cruise ships,
like your old man?

06:05.800 --> 06:08.368
Cruise ships
are hardly lady-like

06:08.411 --> 06:11.283
and, in your case,
barely profitable.

06:11.327 --> 06:14.330
Well, maybe not enough for some.

06:14.374 --> 06:15.374
Indeed not.

06:19.988 --> 06:21.816
Mama, are you leaving?

06:21.859 --> 06:24.558
Oh, well, I have to go
get my hair cut and styled

06:24.601 --> 06:26.342
and a manicure
for your big night.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.779
It's all about you, Leigh.

06:32.479 --> 06:35.612
I spared no expense
for your coming-out party.

06:37.092 --> 06:39.050
Oh, it's beautiful, Mama.

06:39.094 --> 06:40.704
A grown-up dress

06:40.748 --> 06:42.314
for a grown-up woman.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.276
Wait. There's more.

06:49.757 --> 06:51.106
What does this do?

06:51.149 --> 06:53.674
It will make your skin
soft and supple.

06:53.717 --> 06:56.851
It's never too soon to fight
the ghoulish aging process.

06:58.548 --> 06:59.854
Can you tell me
that story again?

06:59.897 --> 07:01.421
Of when you were young?

07:01.464 --> 07:03.771
I still am young.

07:03.814 --> 07:05.425
I mean, when you were a girl.

07:14.172 --> 07:15.826
When I was a girl...

07:15.870 --> 07:18.350
not much older than you are now,

07:18.394 --> 07:21.005
which wasn't that long ago,

07:21.049 --> 07:24.226
I didn't have what you have.

07:24.269 --> 07:26.881
I was forced to work like a dog,

07:26.924 --> 07:31.407
with my sisters
ordering me around.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.801
They would tell me that...

07:36.934 --> 07:38.980
Well...

07:41.504 --> 07:44.507
They used to tell me
that I was ugly, Leigh...

07:44.551 --> 07:47.554
Ugly and gangly,

07:47.597 --> 07:50.731
and that I would never
find a husband.

07:50.774 --> 07:53.124
You've always
been beautiful, Mama.

07:57.564 --> 07:59.783
Thank you for lying, Leigh.

07:59.827 --> 08:01.219
I'm not lying.

08:03.613 --> 08:08.270
Everything changed
when a man came to town...

08:08.313 --> 08:10.272
looking to marry.

08:11.578 --> 08:14.406
My sisters
had their own designs on him.

08:14.450 --> 08:17.758
While they fussing
and primping their dresses,

08:17.801 --> 08:20.064
I had to clean the house.

08:20.108 --> 08:22.240
But then do you know
who he chose?

08:22.284 --> 08:23.503
You, Mama?

08:24.765 --> 08:26.549
You and Papa are both so lucky.

08:28.072 --> 08:29.509
It wasn't just luck.

08:31.075 --> 08:32.729
I had been watching

08:32.773 --> 08:36.080
and learning
how ladies behaved...

08:37.385 --> 08:39.519
how to lure men.

08:39.562 --> 08:44.524
How to make him want me
to be their ornament.

08:45.916 --> 08:47.788
Because, Leigh,

08:47.831 --> 08:50.138
women...

08:50.181 --> 08:54.011
never get to really
have their own lives.

08:54.055 --> 08:58.581
They must be accessories
to the lives of men.

08:59.887 --> 09:00.975
We do?

09:01.018 --> 09:02.933
Oh, yes.

09:04.413 --> 09:07.198
And now that you're older...

09:07.242 --> 09:08.983
I must teach you.

09:09.026 --> 09:11.551
If you have nice hair,

09:11.594 --> 09:15.424
heels, and expensive clothes,

09:15.467 --> 09:18.079
and your natural beauty...

09:18.122 --> 09:21.343
you can have any man you want.

09:21.386 --> 09:22.692
Someone like Papa?

09:25.260 --> 09:27.262
Set your sights higher.

09:27.305 --> 09:30.004
And by "higher," I mean richer.

09:30.047 --> 09:32.441
True wealth.

09:34.530 --> 09:35.923
For your party this weekend,

09:35.966 --> 09:38.099
I am taking you somewhere

09:38.142 --> 09:41.929
so you can see the kind of life
you should strive for,

09:41.972 --> 09:44.322
and the kind of man.

09:59.424 --> 10:01.513
Isn't she darling?

10:01.557 --> 10:04.778
Leigh, this is Tony Tatterton.

10:09.217 --> 10:10.871
Welcome to my humble abode.

10:16.703 --> 10:19.575
Ah, and this is
my baby brother, Troy.

10:19.619 --> 10:20.750
I'm not a baby.

10:21.751 --> 10:22.752
Hello, Troy.

10:22.796 --> 10:23.710
Hello.

10:23.753 --> 10:24.754
Now come.

10:24.798 --> 10:26.277
We must show you

10:26.321 --> 10:28.281
what your mother has been up to
in her spare time.

10:32.806 --> 10:34.634
Mama...

10:34.677 --> 10:36.940
this is the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

10:36.984 --> 10:39.073
Well, Leigh,
I'm not quite finished yet.

10:39.116 --> 10:40.354
The only thing
that would make it better

10:40.378 --> 10:42.163
is if Jillian was in it herself.

10:42.206 --> 10:43.817
You're too kind.
Thank you.

10:43.860 --> 10:45.862
Leigh, look.

10:45.906 --> 10:47.037
Your mother put me in it.

10:48.648 --> 10:51.172
Imagine. This kind of talent
at the age of 28.

10:52.390 --> 10:53.783
But Mama is...

10:53.827 --> 10:56.177
Tony, why don't
I get started here,

10:56.220 --> 10:58.788
and you can show Leigh
the rest of the estate.

10:58.832 --> 11:00.529
But Mama,
I want to watch you paint.

11:00.572 --> 11:02.574
I can only work alone, dear.

11:02.618 --> 11:04.881
Let me show you around then.

11:04.925 --> 11:06.927
Go on, doll.

11:08.189 --> 11:09.756
Is Farthinggale
where you grew up?

11:09.799 --> 11:11.975
The only home I've ever known.

11:12.019 --> 11:14.804
I've only lived
in our home, too,

11:14.848 --> 11:17.502
even though Papa
travels so very often.

11:17.546 --> 11:19.504
Well, we both must
broaden your horizons.

11:19.548 --> 11:21.724
There's the maze.

11:21.768 --> 11:23.770
Wow. That looks fun.

11:23.813 --> 11:25.162
Don't let it fool you.

11:25.206 --> 11:27.077
People have gotten lost
in there.

11:31.603 --> 11:33.146
Troy, why don't you
take Leigh to the studio

11:33.170 --> 11:34.868
to show her some Tatterton Toys?

12:00.632 --> 12:02.025
Stay till midnight.

12:02.069 --> 12:04.898
You're incorrigible!

12:06.638 --> 12:09.119
Oh! There you are.

12:12.209 --> 12:15.038
Really, I don't know
what you think you saw.

12:15.082 --> 12:16.561
He was zipping up your dress.

12:16.605 --> 12:18.215
Because it came unzipped!

12:18.259 --> 12:19.782
Oh, my.

12:19.826 --> 12:21.697
You're adorable.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.438
Such an imagination.

12:23.481 --> 12:24.918
The things you think of!

12:26.876 --> 12:30.271
Wouldn't it be magnificent
to live like that?

12:30.314 --> 12:32.621
That is a real businessman.

12:32.664 --> 12:35.493
He inherited everything
from his family's toy company.

12:35.537 --> 12:36.668
Yeah, so what?

12:36.712 --> 12:38.801
Papa founded his own company.

12:38.845 --> 12:40.542
And all he does is work

12:40.585 --> 12:42.936
and he's a penny away
from bankruptcy.

12:42.979 --> 12:44.851
You deserve better than that...

12:44.894 --> 12:48.028
Which is why tomorrow night
is so special.

12:48.071 --> 12:51.988
You are going to be introduced
to some of the best families

12:52.032 --> 12:55.470
from Boston, Newport, New York,

12:55.513 --> 12:57.385
and most importantly...

12:57.428 --> 12:59.648
their sons.

13:04.435 --> 13:05.872
Oh...

13:05.915 --> 13:07.047
It's Henry.

13:07.090 --> 13:09.832
His father
is in pharmaceuticals.

13:09.876 --> 13:11.747
Good evening.

13:14.054 --> 13:15.229
Pleased to meet you.

13:19.494 --> 13:21.278
Jillian...

13:21.322 --> 13:22.845
you look stunning!

13:22.889 --> 13:24.934
Tony, you're gonna
make me blush.

13:24.978 --> 13:26.718
Um...

13:26.762 --> 13:29.199
Tony, this is
my husband, Cleave.

13:29.243 --> 13:30.461
Ah.

13:30.505 --> 13:31.506
- Tony.
- Mm-hmm.

13:31.549 --> 13:32.855
I've heard about the mural.

13:32.899 --> 13:34.030
I trust you're pleased.

13:34.074 --> 13:35.074
Oh, it's magnificent.

13:36.250 --> 13:37.991
How about that?

13:38.034 --> 13:39.034
Oh! Excuse me.

13:40.689 --> 13:41.689
Hello...

13:46.303 --> 13:48.697
You're a dream, Leigh.

13:48.740 --> 13:50.307
Hello, Tony.

13:50.351 --> 13:51.874
Did Troy come?

13:51.918 --> 13:55.356
Oh, he's quite easily
tired these days.

13:55.399 --> 13:56.748
He's better left at home.

13:56.792 --> 13:58.272
Come, Tony.

13:58.315 --> 14:01.057
Let's go get a drink.

14:10.327 --> 14:11.894
May I?

14:14.592 --> 14:18.335
I have been waiting all evening
for this dance.

14:18.379 --> 14:20.033
You have?

14:20.076 --> 14:21.295
Mm-hmm.

14:25.255 --> 14:28.084
Before you tire yourself out,
may I have a moment?

14:42.142 --> 14:44.013
You know,

14:44.057 --> 14:46.165
one day, I'm gonna have
to give you away at the altar,

14:46.189 --> 14:47.364
Leigh,

14:47.408 --> 14:48.322
so I'd better get used
to lines of boys

14:48.365 --> 14:49.584
vying for your attention.

14:54.067 --> 14:55.938
Still, even though
you'll be married,

14:55.982 --> 14:57.548
I want you to have a choice,

14:57.592 --> 15:00.595
something that is yours
and yours alone...

15:00.638 --> 15:04.033
Perhaps a college degree,
a career,

15:04.077 --> 15:06.993
your own goals and agency.

15:11.214 --> 15:12.824
I got you something.

15:20.441 --> 15:21.877
"Listen to your heart

15:21.921 --> 15:23.923
and the waves
will take you there."

15:32.148 --> 15:33.149
May I?

15:49.513 --> 15:51.515
I love it, Papa.

15:51.559 --> 15:53.474
I love you, sweetie.

16:12.449 --> 16:14.190
What are you doing?

16:14.234 --> 16:15.583
You are embarrassing me.

16:15.626 --> 16:16.932
You're drunk.

16:23.156 --> 16:25.158
I take out
bank loans for your furs,

16:25.201 --> 16:27.029
and still you act
like you are suffering

16:27.073 --> 16:28.552
because we only have
one servant.

16:28.596 --> 16:31.033
Theresa Heinz has four
and she is 10 years younger!

16:31.077 --> 16:32.426
All you care about

16:32.469 --> 16:34.645
is who's who
and your face and your hair!

16:34.689 --> 16:36.256
My "who's who"

16:36.299 --> 16:38.538
and my face and my hair are what
have gotten me here today,

16:38.562 --> 16:41.130
and they will take me
somewhere else.

16:41.174 --> 16:43.350
You and your silly little boats
can hit an iceberg,

16:43.393 --> 16:45.047
for all I care.

16:45.091 --> 16:48.007
I want a divorce.

16:49.269 --> 16:51.880
Then a divorce it is.

17:35.532 --> 17:37.447
Is he gone?

17:37.491 --> 17:38.753
Yes.

17:38.796 --> 17:40.189
Finally.

17:40.233 --> 17:42.104
Where have you been all day?

17:42.148 --> 17:44.280
Reclaiming myself.

17:44.324 --> 17:46.674
Papa is devastated.

17:46.717 --> 17:48.632
How could you do this to him?

17:48.676 --> 17:49.981
Do what?

17:50.025 --> 17:52.375
He's running the business
into the ground.

17:52.419 --> 17:55.335
I practically have
to abandon ship before it sinks.

17:55.378 --> 17:59.513
After all, I know more
about business than he does.

17:59.556 --> 18:01.210
Funny business, you mean?

18:01.254 --> 18:03.517
Like going all the way
with Tony Tatterton?

18:15.137 --> 18:17.357
It's just us now, Leigh.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.924
We have to be strong.

18:21.187 --> 18:23.450
We have to create
new beginnings.

18:24.799 --> 18:26.670
Okay, Mama.

18:30.848 --> 18:33.068
Tony has been
such a wonderful patron.

18:33.112 --> 18:36.637
He wanted to share my mural
with all of you.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.180
How marvelous,
a party to celebrate your mural.

18:38.204 --> 18:40.162
I love it.

18:40.206 --> 18:41.555
It's so sui generis.

18:41.598 --> 18:43.426
Thank you.
You're too kind.

18:43.470 --> 18:45.559
All the more impressive,
given your age.

18:45.602 --> 18:46.603
How's that?

18:46.647 --> 18:48.257
Well, don't they say

18:48.301 --> 18:50.738
artistic development rarely
occurs after the age of 30?

18:50.781 --> 18:54.698
You know, you remind me
of someone I once knew.

18:54.742 --> 18:56.831
The resemblance is striking.

18:56.874 --> 18:57.875
Who's that?

18:57.919 --> 18:59.790
My great-grandmother.

19:12.194 --> 19:14.283
So, Leigh...

19:14.327 --> 19:16.329
what do you think
of your mother's masterpiece?

19:16.372 --> 19:19.070
I really had no idea
she was this good.

19:19.114 --> 19:20.985
She could make a career of it.

19:21.029 --> 19:23.423
When you're wealthy,
you don't need a career.

19:23.466 --> 19:24.902
That's why it's a hobby.

19:24.946 --> 19:28.079
Much more lady-like.

19:28.123 --> 19:30.169
Look at the detail.

19:30.212 --> 19:33.520
Passion and authority
in every brushstroke.

19:34.999 --> 19:37.045
That's what makes it
beautiful, Leigh,

19:37.088 --> 19:38.351
even great.

19:38.394 --> 19:41.223
I learned that toy-making,

19:41.267 --> 19:43.312
and it's corroborated tonight

19:43.356 --> 19:45.401
by your stunning presence
in that dress.

19:47.490 --> 19:51.059
How you've developed
these past few weeks.

19:51.102 --> 19:53.235
Your style, that is.

19:53.279 --> 19:56.325
Like a movie star...

19:56.369 --> 19:59.198
while, before,
you seemed to be just a child.

20:01.287 --> 20:04.115
If only Papa could see this,

20:04.159 --> 20:07.249
then maybe he would understand
Mama more.

20:07.293 --> 20:10.165
And then they could
get back together.

20:11.427 --> 20:12.863
And then...

20:12.907 --> 20:14.256
I guess it must be easy

20:14.300 --> 20:17.390
to assume a woman like my mama
must be single.

20:18.913 --> 20:20.436
So perhaps you could
talk to my papa

20:20.480 --> 20:22.743
and explain
the misunderstanding?

20:24.527 --> 20:27.095
You're so sweet.

20:30.011 --> 20:31.534
Everyone.

20:31.578 --> 20:35.277
This remarkable woman

20:35.321 --> 20:38.367
and brilliant artist
at my side tonight

20:38.411 --> 20:42.850
has brought life, love,
and magic into this house...

20:42.893 --> 20:44.460
and I never want that to change.

20:46.332 --> 20:48.452
That's why Jillian and I
have an announcement to make.

20:53.556 --> 20:54.514
We're getting married!

20:54.557 --> 20:57.125
Oh!

21:00.694 --> 21:01.912
Tony!

21:08.789 --> 21:11.182
Of course, you are all
invited to the ceremony,

21:11.226 --> 21:13.446
which will take place
here at Farthy,

21:13.489 --> 21:15.230
one week before Christmas.

21:15.274 --> 21:16.710
What is more...

21:16.753 --> 21:19.495
Jillian
and her lovely daughter, Leigh,

21:19.539 --> 21:21.628
will be moving in here
tout de suite.

21:21.671 --> 21:23.673
Please, Mama, no.

21:23.717 --> 21:25.109
Shh.

21:25.153 --> 21:27.416
You expect me to give up
everything that I know?

21:27.460 --> 21:28.635
Everyone that I love?

21:28.678 --> 21:29.984
My school?

21:30.027 --> 21:31.681
My friends?

21:31.725 --> 21:33.292
I will not move in here

21:33.335 --> 21:34.735
and I will not let you
ruin my life!

21:41.430 --> 21:42.431
Hello?

21:42.475 --> 21:43.693
Papa?

21:43.737 --> 21:46.217
I'm so glad that you're there.

21:46.261 --> 21:47.349
What's wrong, kitten?

21:47.393 --> 21:48.872
Everything.

21:48.916 --> 21:50.178
They're getting married.

21:50.221 --> 21:51.614
You have to stop it.

21:51.658 --> 21:53.050
Well, uh...

21:53.094 --> 21:55.139
Your mother
has her own free will.

21:55.183 --> 21:56.358
Maybe you can ask her

21:56.402 --> 21:57.664
to take you back and we...

21:57.707 --> 21:59.100
And she'll say no.

21:59.143 --> 22:00.754
Stay away from her, Cleave.

22:00.797 --> 22:02.103
Jillian, wait.
Jillian!

22:08.414 --> 22:11.460
How dare you embarrass me
in front of all those people?

22:11.504 --> 22:12.853
Do you want me

22:12.896 --> 22:14.526
to send you to boarding school
in Switzerland

22:14.550 --> 22:17.727
and have the nuns
crack your knuckles with rulers?

22:17.771 --> 22:19.425
I'd be happy to do it.

22:19.468 --> 22:21.122
It certainly would make
my life easier.

22:21.165 --> 22:22.732
I'd rather move there than here!

22:22.776 --> 22:24.865
Stop being an ingrate.

22:24.908 --> 22:27.955
This is one of the finest
estates in the country.

22:27.998 --> 22:29.391
Don't make me
move out of our home.

22:29.435 --> 22:30.479
You and I can live there.

22:30.523 --> 22:31.804
Your father and I
have sold the house

22:31.828 --> 22:34.091
and we've already
signed the divorce papers.

22:34.135 --> 22:36.050
It's over, Leigh.

22:50.673 --> 22:51.761
Now, remember,

22:51.805 --> 22:52.980
this is going to be

22:53.023 --> 22:55.286
the finest wedding
of the season.

22:55.330 --> 22:57.376
There is no expense

22:57.419 --> 22:59.421
that's too much
for Mr. Tony Tatteron.

22:59.465 --> 23:01.118
Now, remember,

23:01.162 --> 23:04.861
we want the bride and groom
to be...

23:06.472 --> 23:08.735
I want to make sure
that as I'm walking out,

23:08.778 --> 23:10.214
everyone sees...

23:12.173 --> 23:13.566
And no orange.

23:13.609 --> 23:14.849
You know how I feel about that.

23:16.395 --> 23:17.961
I want lots of flowers and...

23:23.097 --> 23:24.185
Uh-uh! Careful.

23:24.228 --> 23:25.229
That is Baccarat crystal.

23:25.273 --> 23:27.362
It is worth a fortune.

23:27.406 --> 23:30.017
And be careful
with the canvases.

23:30.060 --> 23:31.322
I think we should use

23:31.366 --> 23:33.083
the guest list from
Leigh's coming-out party

23:33.107 --> 23:35.414
as a starting point
for the wedding.

23:35.457 --> 23:38.199
Who would turn down an invite?

23:38.242 --> 23:41.681
And no extravagance
is too extravagant.

23:41.724 --> 23:43.596
Can we invite Papa
to the wedding?

23:45.249 --> 23:47.469
Honey...

23:47.513 --> 23:50.429
it's pointless
to live in the past.

23:50.472 --> 23:52.343
We must move on.

23:52.387 --> 23:53.432
Besides...

23:56.173 --> 23:58.306
Look at this place.

23:58.349 --> 24:00.482
Isn't it fantastic?

24:00.526 --> 24:02.876
Now, I've been thinking.

24:02.919 --> 24:04.791
The Baccarat crystal
would fit perfectly

24:04.834 --> 24:06.357
in that nook in the entrance.

24:08.882 --> 24:11.493
While your mother
fusses with all this,

24:11.537 --> 24:12.886
I'll show you to your suite.

24:27.944 --> 24:30.512
Is this my room?

24:30.556 --> 24:32.514
It's your suite, Leigh.

24:35.561 --> 24:37.998
Down the hall
is a separate sitting room

24:38.041 --> 24:39.913
and a private study,

24:39.956 --> 24:42.306
and, of course,
your own private bathroom.

24:47.398 --> 24:49.488
Those are mine.

24:49.531 --> 24:51.751
From my company.

24:52.926 --> 24:54.405
They're marvelous.

25:16.297 --> 25:17.690
I take that you like it?

25:20.214 --> 25:22.346
Well, I'll leave you to it.

25:22.390 --> 25:23.933
I'll send up your governess
so you can meet her.

25:23.957 --> 25:25.088
My governess?

25:25.132 --> 25:26.699
A lady must be attended to.

25:36.970 --> 25:38.885
What lovely thick hair
you've got.

25:38.928 --> 25:40.626
My name is Edith.

25:42.062 --> 25:44.630
Oh, you mustn't curtsy
for me, dear.

25:44.673 --> 25:45.935
My father said

25:45.979 --> 25:47.981
that a lady always shows respect
to anyone.

25:48.024 --> 25:50.113
Well, he sounds like
a wonderful man.

25:52.507 --> 25:53.421
How do you like
your suite, Leigh?

25:53.464 --> 25:54.857
It's even bigger than mine.

25:54.901 --> 25:56.032
It's wonderful.

25:56.076 --> 25:57.468
Perhaps we can go play.

25:57.512 --> 25:58.632
Would you like see the maze?

25:59.601 --> 26:01.864
Let's go.

26:01.908 --> 26:03.866
Every summer,
Tony has his gardeners

26:03.910 --> 26:05.564
plant new trees
and change the maze,

26:05.607 --> 26:07.043
so it's unique.

26:07.087 --> 26:08.325
He doesn't want
anyone getting bored

26:08.349 --> 26:10.220
or running out of
things to do here.

26:10.264 --> 26:13.267
I don't think I'll ever run out
of things to do here.

26:15.182 --> 26:17.967
The trick to finding
the way out if you're lost...

26:18.011 --> 26:19.099
Candies,

26:19.142 --> 26:20.404
Where does the maze go?

26:20.448 --> 26:23.016
I've actually never
gone to the end, myself.

26:23.059 --> 26:24.800
It's just dead end
after dead end,

26:24.844 --> 26:27.150
which is why
we have the candies.

26:27.194 --> 26:29.849
Good idea.

26:33.461 --> 26:36.072
I'm going
to become a photographer,

26:36.116 --> 26:39.859
make you my sole subject.

26:39.902 --> 26:42.731
I'll be more famous
than Ansel Adams.

26:45.995 --> 26:48.694
Let's go again, shall we?

26:48.737 --> 26:51.087
Again?

26:51.131 --> 26:53.089
I just fixed my makeup.

27:04.144 --> 27:05.319
I think it's gonna rain.

27:05.362 --> 27:06.973
We should head back.

27:07.016 --> 27:09.497
Um, okay, follow me.

27:14.328 --> 27:16.025
Let's hurry.

27:16.069 --> 27:18.375
Um... this way.

27:33.477 --> 27:35.784
Where are the candies?

27:37.003 --> 27:38.439
The leaves are covering them!

28:01.462 --> 28:04.160
I can't wait
to call you "Mrs. Tatterton."

28:08.034 --> 28:10.732
Mr. Tatterton,
I'm so sorry.

28:10.776 --> 28:13.039
I'm worried about
Troy and Leigh.

28:13.082 --> 28:14.910
Why?

28:14.954 --> 28:16.390
I can't find them.

28:16.433 --> 28:19.306
We've looked at the beach,
the barn, everywhere,

28:19.349 --> 28:21.656
and that storm is rolling in.

28:24.528 --> 28:26.792
The maze.

28:27.967 --> 28:30.404
Someone! Help!

28:32.928 --> 28:35.104
My hands are so cold
I can't feel them!

28:35.148 --> 28:36.323
Okay. Okay.

28:37.977 --> 28:39.935
- Here, take this.
- No!

28:39.979 --> 28:41.676
You need it.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.286
Come on, come on.
It's okay.

28:46.028 --> 28:47.377
You stay here.

28:47.421 --> 28:49.553
I'm not going anywhere.

29:01.391 --> 29:03.350
Help!

29:03.393 --> 29:05.178
Anybody!

29:07.833 --> 29:09.704
Come on.

29:09.748 --> 29:10.966
Come on.
It's okay.

29:12.141 --> 29:13.273
It's okay.
It's okay.

29:13.316 --> 29:16.015
- I'm cold!
- Come close.

29:16.058 --> 29:18.887
Troy! Leigh!
Where are you?

29:18.931 --> 29:19.975
Help!

29:20.019 --> 29:21.803
Wait!

29:21.847 --> 29:24.545
Hey! Troy! Leigh!

29:25.720 --> 29:26.677
Help!

29:26.721 --> 29:28.505
- Troy!
- Do you hear that?

29:29.811 --> 29:31.334
Sounds like the wind to me, sir.

29:31.378 --> 29:32.814
Help!

29:32.858 --> 29:33.859
This way!

29:33.902 --> 29:36.209
Help!

29:36.252 --> 29:38.254
Leigh! Leigh!

29:38.298 --> 29:40.300
Tony! We're here!

29:41.649 --> 29:42.737
Hey!

29:42.781 --> 29:45.087
Hey, I'm here!

29:45.131 --> 29:46.480
- You okay?
- Cold.

29:48.047 --> 29:49.918
Get them back to the house, now!

29:49.962 --> 29:51.311
You okay?

29:51.354 --> 29:53.617
Yes.

29:53.661 --> 29:56.055
Here! Put this on!

29:56.098 --> 29:58.231
Let's go!

30:06.021 --> 30:07.240
Thank you.

30:07.283 --> 30:08.589
We're going to need
more blankets

30:08.632 --> 30:10.504
and some hot water, thank you.

30:10.547 --> 30:11.418
The doctor's on his way?

30:11.461 --> 30:12.506
Yes, sir.

30:12.549 --> 30:14.421
Is Troy going to be okay?

30:14.464 --> 30:16.466
He does have
a touch of hypothermia.

30:16.510 --> 30:18.425
With his delicate constitution,
one never knows,

30:18.468 --> 30:19.468
but I think so.

30:21.123 --> 30:23.778
He's going to be okay, Leigh,
thanks to you.

30:23.822 --> 30:26.781
Come on.
Let's get you warm.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.522
You must be freezing
to the bone.

30:47.410 --> 30:49.238
You gave Troy your coat.

30:49.282 --> 30:51.110
You saved him.

30:51.153 --> 30:53.852
You truly are
a remarkable woman.

30:59.379 --> 31:00.597
Take it off.

31:05.733 --> 31:09.302
There's no need to be shy
or feel ashamed.

31:09.345 --> 31:11.739
We'll soon be family,

31:11.782 --> 31:13.654
and there are no secrets
among family.

31:34.153 --> 31:35.153
Are you in?

31:36.285 --> 31:37.286
Yes.

31:42.813 --> 31:44.032
Is it warm enough?

32:16.282 --> 32:17.979
You're perfect.

32:19.415 --> 32:21.504
This skin...

32:21.548 --> 32:23.637
and your hair...

32:24.812 --> 32:26.161
It's flawless.

32:28.555 --> 32:31.210
Beautiful inside and out.

32:39.696 --> 32:41.220
You don't have to.

32:41.263 --> 32:42.569
I do.

32:42.612 --> 32:45.137
We have to get the blood flow
to return.

32:46.703 --> 32:48.531
Now relax.

32:48.575 --> 32:50.533
Please... it's okay.

32:51.708 --> 32:53.275
You don't need you to.

32:53.319 --> 32:55.190
I don't want you to.

32:56.931 --> 32:58.889
Shh...

33:00.065 --> 33:02.632
My sweet...

33:02.676 --> 33:04.330
sweet daughter.

33:10.510 --> 33:12.512
I have the most marvelous idea.

33:12.555 --> 33:14.079
I want you...

33:15.428 --> 33:16.907
to model for me.

33:16.951 --> 33:18.083
Model?

33:18.126 --> 33:20.694
For my new line
of bespoke dolls.

33:20.737 --> 33:23.044
I need a new prototype.

33:23.088 --> 33:25.046
You're perfect.

33:26.613 --> 33:29.442
Darling.
What do you think?

33:29.485 --> 33:30.878
Isn't it brilliant?

33:30.921 --> 33:32.227
Indeed.

33:32.271 --> 33:34.012
Brilliant of Leigh.

33:36.188 --> 33:39.930
I have to go check on Troy.

33:53.944 --> 33:55.120
Are you warm now?

33:57.122 --> 33:59.689
Do you like sitting there,

33:59.733 --> 34:01.256
naked,

34:01.300 --> 34:02.866
with a man,

34:02.910 --> 34:05.260
my man,

34:05.304 --> 34:07.132
just like your mama?

34:11.875 --> 34:14.878
That little stunt out there...

34:14.922 --> 34:16.445
you don't think I see it?

34:16.489 --> 34:19.100
I'm confused.

34:19.143 --> 34:21.014
We were p-playing and...

34:21.059 --> 34:23.409
Tony is mine.

34:25.150 --> 34:27.282
He's marrying me.

34:27.326 --> 34:28.978
Of course,
he's marrying you, Mother.

34:30.284 --> 34:32.070
Are you okay?

34:37.900 --> 34:40.078
I need to take a pill and sleep.

34:41.601 --> 34:44.168
It's been a long day.

34:53.830 --> 34:56.398
Mm. This one's a bit plain,
isn't it?

34:56.442 --> 34:58.618
None of the off-the-racks
will do,

34:58.661 --> 35:00.010
so see if we can get

35:00.054 --> 35:01.654
some material samples
from the designers.

35:05.364 --> 35:06.756
Mm.

35:06.800 --> 35:07.931
Oh, good morning, Leigh.

35:07.975 --> 35:09.803
Oh, my.

35:09.846 --> 35:12.588
We really must do something with
your hair before the wedding.

35:12.632 --> 35:13.632
Are you hungry?

35:15.374 --> 35:17.724
She would like a grapefruit.

35:21.162 --> 35:23.251
Where are Troy and Tony?

35:23.295 --> 35:24.818
At the doctor's office.

35:24.861 --> 35:27.821
Last night, he asked Tony
to bring Troy "first thing"

35:27.864 --> 35:29.127
for another evaluation.

35:29.170 --> 35:30.476
Oh, my God.

35:30.519 --> 35:32.173
He's fine.
He's a sickling.

35:35.176 --> 35:38.919
I wanted to apologize
about last night.

35:38.962 --> 35:42.052
When I saw Tony
tending you in the tub,

35:42.096 --> 35:43.837
it put me into a state.

35:43.880 --> 35:46.361
Of confusion.

35:46.405 --> 35:49.147
Emotional confusion.

35:49.190 --> 35:51.584
And I don't want
anything to be strange.

35:51.627 --> 35:53.020
But wasn't it?

35:54.369 --> 35:56.458
Him bathing me felt...

35:56.502 --> 35:58.199
improper.

35:58.243 --> 35:59.940
I didn't like it.

36:01.246 --> 36:02.899
Well, he's going to be
your father soon,

36:02.943 --> 36:07.165
so you need to get over
your silly teen hang-ups.

36:08.688 --> 36:10.385
Now...

36:10.429 --> 36:14.215
why don't you help me
plan our honeymoon?

36:14.259 --> 36:16.217
That'll cheer us up.
What do you say?

36:16.261 --> 36:17.479
Hmm?

36:17.523 --> 36:19.394
Oh. Thank you.

36:24.660 --> 36:26.184
Oh, God.

36:26.227 --> 36:29.578
Your grandmother's
going to be here later today.

36:29.622 --> 36:31.711
Grandma Jana?

36:31.754 --> 36:33.582
What's the occasion?

36:33.626 --> 36:35.715
The same as it always is.

36:35.758 --> 36:38.413
The opportunity to meddle.

36:50.860 --> 36:52.384
Grandma Jana!

36:52.427 --> 36:53.646
Oh!

36:53.689 --> 36:55.909
Hey there, sugar.

36:55.952 --> 36:57.650
I've come to check on you.

36:57.693 --> 36:59.565
They treating you well?

36:59.608 --> 37:01.262
Okay, I guess.

37:01.306 --> 37:04.483
Where are they, your mother
and this boy she's gonna marry?

37:04.526 --> 37:06.311
Tony Tatterton.

37:06.354 --> 37:08.051
Welcome.

37:08.095 --> 37:09.183
Oh, goodness.

37:09.227 --> 37:10.924
You really are only a boy.

37:10.967 --> 37:12.578
My daughter could be your mo...

37:12.621 --> 37:14.971
Mother!
Darling.

37:17.496 --> 37:19.019
Let's get you settled in.

37:19.062 --> 37:20.455
Indeed.

37:20.499 --> 37:22.196
Jillian, show Mrs. Jankins
to her room.

37:24.981 --> 37:26.896
Where did you get that accent?

37:26.940 --> 37:28.289
"Mother, darling."

37:28.333 --> 37:30.030
It's called "class."

37:30.073 --> 37:32.293
And how long
did you plan on staying?

37:32.337 --> 37:33.555
As long as it takes

37:33.599 --> 37:36.863
to make sure
that you are on the up and up.

37:50.877 --> 37:51.965
Oh, Mother!

37:52.008 --> 37:54.837
I don't care what you think!

37:54.881 --> 37:56.796
And it's none of
your business anyway.

37:56.839 --> 37:58.885
I'll be right back, Troy, okay?

37:58.928 --> 38:00.321
Do you think it was easy to find

38:00.365 --> 38:02.410
a respectable man like Cleave
to marry you

38:02.454 --> 38:04.673
when you already had
a-a bun in the oven?

38:04.717 --> 38:05.805
You don't know that.

38:05.848 --> 38:06.980
Oh, come on!

38:07.023 --> 38:10.200
Jillian, you know
as well as I do,

38:10.244 --> 38:12.594
she looks nothing like Cleave.

38:12.638 --> 38:15.162
I don't know
who you're trying to fool.

38:15.205 --> 38:16.859
She's not his.

38:16.903 --> 38:18.208
Where are you going?

38:18.252 --> 38:20.123
To get to know
your Mr. Tatterton.

38:20.167 --> 38:21.603
Mama, wait.

38:21.647 --> 38:23.649
You have no right!

38:33.354 --> 38:34.660
But is it true?

38:34.703 --> 38:36.096
Am I not your daughter?

38:36.139 --> 38:38.446
Leigh.

38:40.883 --> 38:42.537
You are my daughter

38:42.581 --> 38:44.974
and I am your father,
and that's all that matters.

38:46.236 --> 38:48.674
Are you okay, sweetheart?

38:48.717 --> 38:50.893
Yes.

38:50.937 --> 38:53.200
Yes, I'm okay, Papa.

38:53.243 --> 38:55.768
Listen, I will always be here
for you. Always.

38:55.811 --> 38:57.900
And I don't care
what your mother says.

38:57.944 --> 38:59.293
We can visit sometime.

38:59.337 --> 39:00.381
Would you like that?

39:00.425 --> 39:01.339
Very much.

39:01.382 --> 39:03.166
Good.

39:03.210 --> 39:05.255
We'll sneak around,
like she did.

39:05.299 --> 39:07.388
You are a such a little
grown-up, aren't you?

39:07.432 --> 39:09.825
I think
that is an excellent idea.

39:09.869 --> 39:13.307
I love you.
Bye-bye, kitten.

39:13.351 --> 39:15.265
Bye.

39:22.664 --> 39:25.319
You know, Leigh...

39:25.363 --> 39:29.279
I came here to rescue you
from your mother,

39:29.323 --> 39:32.457
but I'm very pleased to see
how strong you are.

39:32.500 --> 39:34.763
Mr. Tatterton,
Tony and I,

39:34.807 --> 39:36.417
were just chatting,

39:36.461 --> 39:39.377
and he was telling me how well
you're getting along here.

39:39.420 --> 39:41.204
Actually, I think
you're going to be okay.

39:41.248 --> 39:42.597
You do?

39:42.641 --> 39:44.599
I do.

39:44.643 --> 39:46.732
And maybe...

39:48.386 --> 39:50.562
Maybe...

39:50.605 --> 39:53.391
this is where
you need to be right now.

39:53.434 --> 39:55.436
You'll get the education
you need

39:55.480 --> 39:58.874
and you will become
a fine young woman.

40:03.357 --> 40:05.838
Listen.

40:05.881 --> 40:08.014
If things get too bad,

40:08.057 --> 40:10.408
I don't want you
doing anything foolish,

40:10.451 --> 40:11.626
so you call me

40:11.670 --> 40:12.410
and I'll bring you
right back to Texas,

40:12.453 --> 40:13.453
to live with me.

40:17.110 --> 40:20.287
Oh... Don't cry.
Come on now.

40:20.330 --> 40:22.681
You're gonna be
perfectly fine here.

40:22.724 --> 40:24.422
And this fella...

40:24.465 --> 40:26.336
Tony...

40:26.380 --> 40:28.208
He seems like a real gentleman.

40:28.251 --> 40:29.818
He can guide you.

40:29.862 --> 40:31.994
Protect you from your mother.

40:33.082 --> 40:34.954
I trust him.

40:36.346 --> 40:38.827
He has those Dean Martin eyes.

40:58.020 --> 40:59.500
This is your doing, isn't it?

40:59.544 --> 41:00.719
What is it, Mama?

41:00.762 --> 41:03.112
It's a prenup, is what it is.

41:03.156 --> 41:04.897
It's our ruin.

41:04.940 --> 41:06.681
I could just ring your neck!

41:06.725 --> 41:08.901
Mama, I didn't do anything.

41:08.944 --> 41:10.859
If Tony and I were to divorce,

41:10.903 --> 41:13.079
we wouldn't get a dime!

41:13.122 --> 41:14.646
But why would you get a divorce?

41:14.689 --> 41:16.691
Because look at you!

41:16.735 --> 41:18.301
I swear, I didn't do anything.

41:18.345 --> 41:19.564
And look at me!

41:19.607 --> 41:22.218
The clock keeps ticking, Leigh!

41:22.262 --> 41:24.133
But Tony loves you.

41:24.177 --> 41:26.527
You're the most beautiful woman
in the whole world.

41:32.446 --> 41:35.231
It was Mother...

41:35.275 --> 41:37.538
poisoning the well.

41:39.105 --> 41:40.933
Who knows what she said.

41:42.151 --> 41:44.110
Did he say anything?

41:47.896 --> 41:49.811
She's always been jealous.

41:49.855 --> 41:51.073
Jealous of what?

41:52.205 --> 41:54.990
Of my ability to attract men.

41:56.426 --> 41:58.428
Of my youth.

41:58.472 --> 42:00.561
Because I'm young...

42:01.867 --> 42:03.912
And yet not.

42:03.956 --> 42:05.740
Mama, you're not
making any sense.

42:11.877 --> 42:14.270
My sweet daughter.

42:14.314 --> 42:16.490
I'm so sorry.

42:18.623 --> 42:21.669
This stress
has just been overwhelming,

42:21.713 --> 42:23.236
but, after the wedding,

42:23.279 --> 42:25.804
everything will go back
to normal, I promise you.

42:29.024 --> 42:30.373
But...

42:30.417 --> 42:32.462
I need you to promise me
something in return.

42:34.900 --> 42:36.902
That you won't take Tony
away from me.

42:38.077 --> 42:39.600
Why would I ever?

42:39.644 --> 42:40.775
I know that you want

42:40.819 --> 42:42.864
a grand life of your own
some day...

42:44.039 --> 42:46.999
and some day you will have it.

42:47.042 --> 42:49.218
Your own life,

42:49.262 --> 42:50.959
and your own
strapping young man.

42:52.395 --> 42:54.136
I want a man like Papa.

42:58.532 --> 43:01.840
Except, since the divorce,

43:01.883 --> 43:04.669
when has he last visited?

43:05.887 --> 43:08.020
Has he reached out?

43:08.063 --> 43:09.848
Does he write?

43:09.891 --> 43:11.023
But he said he would.

43:14.592 --> 43:15.810
But did he?

43:19.335 --> 43:21.642
And how many letters
have you written him?

43:21.686 --> 43:24.645
I don't know how many
we've sent out for you.

43:24.689 --> 43:26.821
A lot.

43:44.491 --> 43:46.536
John Horowitz, please.

43:46.580 --> 43:48.974
John, it's Jillian.

43:49.017 --> 43:53.456
I need you to write
my ex-husband a legal letter.

43:53.500 --> 43:56.198
He's not Leigh's father...

43:56.242 --> 43:58.157
and I can prove it.

43:58.200 --> 43:59.985
I don't want him
filling her head

44:00.028 --> 44:01.682
with nonsensical ideas

44:01.726 --> 44:04.032
and butting into my affairs.

44:04.076 --> 44:06.121
He needs to stay away...

44:07.557 --> 44:09.690
or else.

44:48.250 --> 44:49.425
Are you okay?

44:59.435 --> 45:00.959
Troy? Are you okay?

45:01.002 --> 45:03.657
I'm okay.
Tony said I am.

45:05.790 --> 45:07.966
Hi!

45:16.801 --> 45:18.803
Let's get you to bed.

45:18.846 --> 45:20.718
Before Santa comes?

45:22.154 --> 45:23.154
Come on.

45:29.509 --> 45:31.598
This one's from me.

45:41.434 --> 45:43.218
It's beautiful.

45:44.785 --> 45:46.918
Thank you!

45:46.961 --> 45:48.180
Merry Christmas, Leigh.

46:11.246 --> 46:12.247
Troy!

46:14.380 --> 46:15.990
Troy! No, no.

46:17.687 --> 46:19.211
Help! Please, someone help!

46:19.254 --> 46:20.299
Troy?

46:20.342 --> 46:21.604
Help!

46:33.529 --> 46:34.748
What's wrong with him?

46:36.881 --> 46:39.187
It's pneumonia.
Very serious.

46:39.231 --> 46:40.841
We're gonna try
to make him comfortable,

46:40.885 --> 46:42.451
but no more disruptions today.

46:42.495 --> 46:43.844
I want to stay with him.

46:43.888 --> 46:45.604
We need you to get in touch
with your parents.

46:45.628 --> 46:47.152
I tried.
They're on their honeymoon.

46:47.195 --> 46:48.980
Try again.
It's urgent.

46:49.023 --> 46:51.112
He may not make it.

47:05.474 --> 47:06.475
My sweet...

47:06.519 --> 47:07.650
sweet daughter.

47:15.745 --> 47:18.444
We came as soon as we heard.

47:21.490 --> 47:25.364
Thank you again and again,
Leigh, for staying by his side.

47:28.628 --> 47:30.412
Did you talk to the doctor?

47:30.456 --> 47:32.762
He's not responding
to medication.

47:32.806 --> 47:35.113
His fever's so high that,
well, his organs could fail.

47:35.156 --> 47:36.592
Ah...

47:38.638 --> 47:39.944
Doctor, I need a word.

47:39.987 --> 47:43.817
Listen, I'm exhausted
from the flight.

47:43.861 --> 47:46.080
Why don't you come home with me
and help me unpack?

47:46.124 --> 47:47.125
I have a gift for you.

47:47.168 --> 47:49.736
Someone has to look after Troy.

47:49.779 --> 47:51.085
A gift, Leigh.

47:51.129 --> 47:52.173
And Tony's here now.

47:52.217 --> 47:53.392
Come.

47:53.435 --> 47:54.959
Now.

47:56.308 --> 47:58.049
Fine. Stay.

47:58.092 --> 48:00.747
What do I care?

48:05.012 --> 48:06.753
I don't know what's happened,

48:06.796 --> 48:08.668
but your mother

48:08.711 --> 48:10.975
has suddenly
turned a cold shoulder to me.

48:11.018 --> 48:12.367
Strange.

48:12.411 --> 48:14.195
All this constant
fretting in the mirror.

48:14.239 --> 48:16.154
What do you make of it?

48:16.197 --> 48:18.678
She just...

48:18.721 --> 48:20.593
tries to be beautiful.

48:20.636 --> 48:23.161
She tries.

48:23.204 --> 48:24.727
Some people just are.

48:33.084 --> 48:35.434
Why don't we head back to Farthy

48:35.477 --> 48:37.697
and we can discuss our new doll?

48:37.740 --> 48:38.698
But, Troy...

48:38.741 --> 48:41.179
He's going to be just fine here.

48:41.222 --> 48:43.703
He's getting
the very best of care.

48:56.281 --> 48:58.326
It's... beautiful.

48:58.370 --> 49:00.285
I've painted it
in my spare time.

49:01.460 --> 49:03.027
From memory, in fact.

49:03.070 --> 49:06.595
But, as unforgettable
as your beauty is...

49:06.639 --> 49:09.163
I'll have to sketch you
in person for the doll.

49:09.207 --> 49:11.905
We might have to get
a little more...

49:11.949 --> 49:12.993
in-depth.

49:13.037 --> 49:14.908
Understood?

49:16.997 --> 49:20.218
Well, now that you see
my vision for you...

49:24.570 --> 49:25.919
Go change into this.

49:50.117 --> 49:52.163
It's cold.

49:52.206 --> 49:54.208
I'll turn up the heat.

49:59.344 --> 50:00.736
Posture

50:00.780 --> 50:02.869
is everything...

50:04.784 --> 50:07.004
for creating shape.

50:09.528 --> 50:11.269
Chest out.

50:12.487 --> 50:14.054
Can you hold like this?

50:14.098 --> 50:16.317
I think so.

50:52.745 --> 50:55.269
No! No, no, no, no, no.

50:55.313 --> 50:57.141
Listen, Leigh...

50:58.533 --> 51:01.058
I need you nude.

51:07.020 --> 51:08.456
Nude?

51:08.500 --> 51:10.023
Like fully naked?

51:10.067 --> 51:11.633
Yes, that's what that means.

51:11.677 --> 51:12.852
But...

51:12.895 --> 51:13.940
So, please.

51:13.983 --> 51:15.898
Otherwise there'll be no doll.

51:15.942 --> 51:18.423
No. No, no, no, no.

51:18.466 --> 51:19.815
There is no other way.

51:20.903 --> 51:22.557
Here.

51:22.601 --> 51:24.342
Look. These...

51:25.821 --> 51:27.345
are the masters.

51:27.388 --> 51:29.042
The best in history.
Now, what do you see?

51:29.086 --> 51:30.522
I...

51:32.132 --> 51:33.133
I don't know.

51:33.177 --> 51:34.221
Beauty, Leigh!

51:34.265 --> 51:35.744
Beauty!

51:35.788 --> 51:37.964
Our betters, years ago,

51:38.007 --> 51:39.748
they weren't ashamed
of the human body.

51:39.792 --> 51:41.228
They celebrated it!

51:41.272 --> 51:43.404
Now, I want...

51:43.448 --> 51:45.319
I need

51:45.363 --> 51:48.583
to celebrate yours
in the same way.

51:48.627 --> 51:50.107
Can we talk to Mama?

51:50.150 --> 51:51.282
I am your father, Leigh.

51:51.325 --> 51:52.805
You don't need her permission.

51:52.848 --> 51:54.023
It's not permission I want.

51:54.067 --> 51:55.112
It's what?

51:56.330 --> 51:58.724
I should just talk to her.

52:08.125 --> 52:10.127
Mama?

52:10.170 --> 52:11.302
Yes.

52:11.345 --> 52:12.477
I have a question.

52:12.520 --> 52:13.652
Yes. What is it?

52:14.914 --> 52:17.656
Tony, wants me to pose for him.

52:17.699 --> 52:19.048
In the nude.

52:21.616 --> 52:23.705
Of course.

52:24.837 --> 52:26.621
Of course.

52:27.883 --> 52:29.711
I've worked too hard, Leigh.

52:31.191 --> 52:33.585
We must make him happy.

52:33.628 --> 52:35.326
What? How?

52:35.369 --> 52:37.066
By doing what he says.

52:37.110 --> 52:38.720
But I don't
want to go back, Mama.

52:38.764 --> 52:42.333
The doll will bring us revenue.

52:42.376 --> 52:44.465
And it is art.

52:44.509 --> 52:45.858
You...

52:45.901 --> 52:47.990
will become art.

52:48.034 --> 52:49.862
Isn't that nice?

52:49.905 --> 52:52.386
And if he's happy,

52:52.430 --> 52:54.823
my marriage is intact.

52:54.867 --> 52:56.521
Mama, please,
don't make me go back.

52:56.564 --> 52:58.262
You'll understand
when you're older.

52:59.611 --> 53:01.700
Just trust me.

53:05.486 --> 53:07.880
I'm going back
to my beauty treatment.

53:52.838 --> 53:54.318
Yes.

53:54.361 --> 53:56.668
Finally.

53:57.973 --> 53:59.061
There you go.

54:07.679 --> 54:09.115
Leigh, my love?

54:10.464 --> 54:12.814
I have a surprise for you.

54:12.858 --> 54:14.773
Is it Troy?

54:14.816 --> 54:16.165
Is he coming home?

54:16.209 --> 54:17.602
I miss him.

54:17.645 --> 54:18.994
No, I'm afraid not.

54:19.038 --> 54:21.040
They're still working on him.

54:21.083 --> 54:24.043
But I have something
to show you.

54:39.841 --> 54:41.843
The finished prototype.

55:02.864 --> 55:04.475
What?

55:04.518 --> 55:05.954
What is it?

55:05.998 --> 55:07.652
It's just...

55:07.695 --> 55:09.828
it's not me at all.

55:09.871 --> 55:10.916
But it is you.

55:10.959 --> 55:12.831
But the detail...

55:12.874 --> 55:14.702
it's the body of a grown woman.

55:14.746 --> 55:16.051
Well, it's your mother's.

55:16.095 --> 55:18.053
A clever amalgam
of the two of you.

55:18.097 --> 55:20.012
I told you
about artistic license.

55:20.055 --> 55:22.884
But... but...

55:22.928 --> 55:24.625
- But what?
- It's humiliating.

55:25.887 --> 55:27.106
It's profane.

55:27.149 --> 55:28.803
Profane?

55:35.767 --> 55:38.030
"Profane?"

55:39.336 --> 55:42.991
I will not be told
about my craft by a child.

55:43.035 --> 55:44.341
You know what I would like?

55:44.384 --> 55:46.255
To make you into
an everlasting sculpture!

55:46.299 --> 55:48.475
Tony, please, I'm sorry!

56:15.372 --> 56:17.722
It's fine, Leigh.

56:19.985 --> 56:23.031
It's supposed to be
a reflection of you,

56:23.075 --> 56:25.338
though if you disagree
so strongly...

56:28.776 --> 56:30.256
Then I'll just
make another doll.

56:30.299 --> 56:32.650
I promise.

56:33.955 --> 56:36.305
I'm not a bad person, Leigh.

56:38.482 --> 56:40.614
Okay?

56:40.658 --> 56:42.921
This is just...

56:44.270 --> 56:46.054
part of the craft.

56:48.143 --> 56:49.754
Oh.

56:51.930 --> 56:53.714
I'm sorry.

57:11.297 --> 57:12.559
Hello, sweet Troy.

57:12.603 --> 57:14.779
Leigh, it's you.

57:18.565 --> 57:20.088
Hey, sport.

57:20.132 --> 57:21.263
How're you feeling?

57:21.307 --> 57:22.264
Better.

57:22.308 --> 57:24.092
That's great.

57:24.136 --> 57:25.572
That's great.

57:26.834 --> 57:29.446
I have something for you.

57:31.273 --> 57:34.146
Open it up.

57:34.189 --> 57:35.930
I changed the body

57:35.974 --> 57:38.324
to make it more doll-like
in its innocence.

57:41.283 --> 57:42.937
It's beautiful.

57:45.070 --> 57:48.116
I know that you doubted me...

57:48.160 --> 57:49.422
and I forgive you.

57:54.209 --> 57:56.603
What are you gonna name her?

57:57.822 --> 57:58.822
I'll name her...

57:59.998 --> 58:02.087
I'll name her Angel.

58:02.130 --> 58:03.523
I love it.

58:03.567 --> 58:05.438
An Angel for an angel.

58:05.482 --> 58:07.198
I'll tell the marketing
department right away.

58:07.222 --> 58:09.660
Now, I have one more surprise.

58:09.703 --> 58:12.489
You didn't think I'd forgot
about your birthday, did you?

58:27.416 --> 58:29.941
Leigh!

58:29.984 --> 58:31.986
Troy!

58:32.030 --> 58:34.249
Oh!

58:34.293 --> 58:35.686
I'm so happy that you're here.

58:35.729 --> 58:36.774
I told the doctors,

58:36.817 --> 58:37.992
if they didn't let me go,

58:38.036 --> 58:39.733
I'd hold my breath
until I turned blue.

58:39.777 --> 58:41.126
Then you'll stay?

58:41.169 --> 58:42.693
As long as
the cough doesn't come back.

58:42.736 --> 58:44.390
Edith?

58:44.433 --> 58:45.522
Can we go get some food?

58:45.565 --> 58:47.436
Yes, eat.

58:47.480 --> 58:49.090
You need to gain some weight.

59:02.277 --> 59:03.801
Hi, I'm James.

59:03.844 --> 59:05.933
Pleased to finally
meet you, Leigh.

59:05.977 --> 59:07.631
And happy birthday.

59:07.674 --> 59:09.371
Thank you.

59:13.201 --> 59:16.161
So tell me more about yourself.

59:16.204 --> 59:18.163
I don't know what to tell you.

59:18.206 --> 59:20.034
Have you ever...
kissed a boy?

59:23.864 --> 59:26.301
Is that a yes?

59:29.130 --> 59:31.045
Just my father.

59:38.139 --> 59:40.664
Get off her,
you dirty little rat!

59:40.707 --> 59:42.100
Tony, please, what are...?

59:42.143 --> 59:43.468
I'm making sure
you don't defile yourself!

59:43.492 --> 59:45.625
Get outta here!

59:47.322 --> 59:48.585
This is my property.

59:48.628 --> 59:50.195
You will obey my rules,

59:50.238 --> 59:52.501
and you are never
to see that boy again.

59:52.545 --> 59:54.460
Let go of me!

59:54.503 --> 59:55.940
You are not my father.

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:18.440
We had to take Troy
back to the hospital.

01:00:20.312 --> 01:00:21.792
He started coughing again.

01:00:24.664 --> 01:00:27.145
Oh, my God.

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:29.582
Is he okay?

01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:32.237
These doctors are very good.

01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:34.413
I trust them.

01:00:41.028 --> 01:00:43.509
I wanted to apologize.

01:00:45.337 --> 01:00:47.513
I know I overreacted.

01:00:49.515 --> 01:00:50.690
But it's because

01:00:50.734 --> 01:00:52.605
I care about you so much...

01:00:53.998 --> 01:00:56.304
And when I see you
with a boy like that,

01:00:56.348 --> 01:00:58.219
I get so incensed.

01:01:00.047 --> 01:01:02.659
I feel like someone's
gonna take you away from me.

01:01:11.668 --> 01:01:13.670
Here.

01:01:15.062 --> 01:01:16.455
Let me tuck you in.

01:01:35.648 --> 01:01:38.085
Goodnight.

01:01:39.783 --> 01:01:41.567
Sweet dreams.

01:02:28.135 --> 01:02:31.791
No! No, no...

01:03:01.255 --> 01:03:02.779
Leigh?

01:03:02.822 --> 01:03:04.041
What's wrong?

01:03:05.694 --> 01:03:08.523
Why don't I
make you some breakfast?

01:03:08.567 --> 01:03:10.177
I can bring it up to your room.

01:03:10.221 --> 01:03:11.135
Your mother's eaten and Tony's...

01:03:11.178 --> 01:03:12.832
Where is he?

01:03:12.876 --> 01:03:15.748
Well, he left this morning
on an extended business trip.

01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:16.880
For how long?

01:03:16.923 --> 01:03:18.620
We're not sure, really.
He didn't say.

01:03:21.885 --> 01:03:24.148
I'll be back
with your breakfast.

01:03:38.249 --> 01:03:40.120
I need your help.

01:03:40.164 --> 01:03:42.166
Mama, please.

01:03:42.209 --> 01:03:43.950
What is it?

01:03:49.738 --> 01:03:51.697
The worst thing happened.

01:03:53.003 --> 01:03:56.571
Tony came to my room last night
and he...

01:03:58.225 --> 01:04:00.314
He raped me.

01:04:03.796 --> 01:04:05.624
You dreamt it.

01:04:05.667 --> 01:04:08.496
He only has eyes for me,
and who could blame him?

01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:10.368
Even though I won't touch him.

01:04:10.411 --> 01:04:11.978
Mama, please listen to me.

01:04:12.022 --> 01:04:13.806
Raped?

01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:16.200
You don't even know
what that means.

01:04:16.243 --> 01:04:17.897
Such an imagination.

01:04:17.941 --> 01:04:19.116
But it happened!

01:04:19.159 --> 01:04:20.639
You dreamt it!

01:04:20.682 --> 01:04:22.206
Now, you will not speak
of such things.

01:04:22.249 --> 01:04:23.424
Do you understand me?

01:04:23.468 --> 01:04:24.948
- Now leave!
- But Mama...

01:04:24.991 --> 01:04:28.081
Why will you not mind me, child?

01:04:28.125 --> 01:04:30.562
Because I'm not a child anymore.

01:05:32.667 --> 01:05:34.931
He's been
gone almost seven weeks

01:05:34.974 --> 01:05:37.498
and I can still feel his weight.

01:05:37.542 --> 01:05:40.719
His ugly smell.

01:05:40.762 --> 01:05:42.590
I can't sleep.

01:05:42.634 --> 01:05:44.288
I can't eat.

01:05:44.331 --> 01:05:47.639
I can barely breathe.

01:05:47.682 --> 01:05:50.033
I have no peace.

01:05:50.076 --> 01:05:52.600
I feel as though
I am awaiting my execution,

01:05:52.644 --> 01:05:55.952
listening for the inevitable
snap of the rope.

01:05:55.995 --> 01:05:57.954
There's no escape.

01:05:57.997 --> 01:05:59.259
I'm alone,

01:05:59.303 --> 01:06:01.870
living in this terrible secret.

01:06:01.914 --> 01:06:04.569
I wish I knew what to do.

01:06:04.612 --> 01:06:06.614
But I'm lost.

01:06:06.658 --> 01:06:07.833
Lost and alone

01:06:07.876 --> 01:06:09.748
and so afraid.

01:06:09.791 --> 01:06:12.577
I'm so very, very afraid.

01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:15.710
"Back to Farthinggale
end of week."

01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:18.670
"T.T."

01:06:25.198 --> 01:06:27.766
I wish you were awake.

01:06:27.809 --> 01:06:30.638
Tony comes back
from his trip soon...

01:06:31.988 --> 01:06:34.164
And so
I have to make a decision.

01:06:35.730 --> 01:06:37.558
Just like my Papa said.

01:06:53.879 --> 01:06:56.925
Oh...
sweetheart, are you okay?

01:06:56.969 --> 01:06:58.753
I've been sick for weeks.

01:06:59.972 --> 01:07:02.018
It's my stomach.

01:07:02.061 --> 01:07:03.976
Stress, I think.

01:07:07.936 --> 01:07:10.200
Have you been having
your period, honey?

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:25.128
How long have you been
keeping this from me?

01:07:26.955 --> 01:07:28.740
No.

01:07:28.783 --> 01:07:30.611
No, this isn't going to happen.

01:07:30.655 --> 01:07:31.960
Do you understand me?

01:07:32.004 --> 01:07:34.876
I will not be a grandmother.

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:36.878
I will not
let you do this to me.

01:07:36.922 --> 01:07:38.445
I didn't do anything!

01:07:38.489 --> 01:07:39.838
I told you, it was him.

01:07:39.881 --> 01:07:41.274
He raped me.

01:07:41.318 --> 01:07:44.756
No. It was you.

01:07:44.799 --> 01:07:46.627
You seduced him!

01:07:48.238 --> 01:07:50.892
We're going
to a special doctor tomorrow,

01:07:50.936 --> 01:07:54.896
to do what I should've done
when I was pregnant with you.

01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:56.681
Now come!

01:07:56.724 --> 01:07:58.528
I'm not doing anything that
you tell me to do ever again!

01:07:58.552 --> 01:08:00.337
How dare
you speak to me like that?

01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:01.555
How dare you?

01:08:02.904 --> 01:08:05.124
I don't know
which I wish more for you...

01:08:05.168 --> 01:08:07.822
That you and Tony
live together forever,

01:08:07.866 --> 01:08:10.825
or that he leaves you
old and penniless.

01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:18.442
I'm my own woman now, Mother!

01:08:18.484 --> 01:08:20.399
Not yours or Tony's.

01:08:20.444 --> 01:08:22.402
Mine!

01:09:42.874 --> 01:09:44.528
Leigh.

01:09:44.571 --> 01:09:45.964
Hi.

01:09:46.006 --> 01:09:47.705
I really need
to speak with my father.

01:09:47.747 --> 01:09:49.228
Can you tell me where he is?

01:09:49.272 --> 01:09:50.621
He's not here, sweetie.

01:09:50.663 --> 01:09:52.013
Then where is he?

01:09:54.102 --> 01:09:55.930
He's at a wedding
in the Caribbean.

01:09:55.974 --> 01:09:57.541
What?

01:09:57.584 --> 01:09:58.716
Whose wedding?

01:09:58.759 --> 01:10:01.588
His wedding, sweetheart.

01:10:01.632 --> 01:10:05.157
He tried to reach you
to tell you himself, but...

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:07.725
I... I don't understand.

01:10:07.768 --> 01:10:09.596
I'm so sorry.

01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:12.077
Your mother
has made it very hard.

01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:14.906
He could go to jail
for trying to see you,

01:10:14.949 --> 01:10:17.125
for violating the court order.

01:10:17.169 --> 01:10:20.041
I would never want that.

01:10:20.085 --> 01:10:21.956
I'd never want
for him to go to jail.

01:10:23.306 --> 01:10:25.133
Wait! Leigh?

01:10:25.177 --> 01:10:27.701
Where are you going?

01:10:27.745 --> 01:10:29.616
The only place I can.

01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:30.791
Leigh!

01:11:01.648 --> 01:11:04.434
Come on in.

01:11:04.477 --> 01:11:06.349
Grandma?

01:11:10.396 --> 01:11:11.615
Hi.

01:11:13.094 --> 01:11:14.487
Who are you?

01:11:14.531 --> 01:11:17.447
I'm Loreen,
the realtor for the bank.

01:11:17.490 --> 01:11:19.362
I'm prepping this house
for sale.

01:11:19.405 --> 01:11:21.015
Who are you?

01:11:21.059 --> 01:11:22.713
Is this Jana Jankins' house?

01:11:22.756 --> 01:11:24.280
Yes.

01:11:24.323 --> 01:11:25.759
My name is Leigh.

01:11:25.803 --> 01:11:27.239
Jana's my grandmother.

01:11:28.545 --> 01:11:30.329
Oh, she...

01:11:30.373 --> 01:11:32.592
was your grandmother, sweetie.

01:11:32.636 --> 01:11:35.421
She passed away
a few nights ago.

01:11:59.315 --> 01:12:01.621
Can't sleep here, miss.

01:12:01.665 --> 01:12:02.492
Go home.

01:12:02.535 --> 01:12:04.450
I don't have one.

01:12:04.494 --> 01:12:06.800
Well, then find one.

01:12:06.844 --> 01:12:08.933
What's wrong with you?
Don't you have a family?

01:12:08.976 --> 01:12:11.196
Easy, mister!

01:12:11.239 --> 01:12:12.893
She's fine.

01:12:12.937 --> 01:12:14.417
She's with me.

01:12:15.722 --> 01:12:16.810
Both of yous...

01:12:17.942 --> 01:12:19.335
Get lost.

01:12:21.206 --> 01:12:23.643
You really don't
have anywhere to go?

01:12:23.687 --> 01:12:24.862
That concerns me.

01:12:24.905 --> 01:12:26.472
I'm fine. Thank you.

01:12:26.516 --> 01:12:27.778
How are you fine?

01:12:27.821 --> 01:12:30.433
You're all alone...
in a train station.

01:12:30.476 --> 01:12:31.956
- I can handle myself.
- You can?

01:12:33.261 --> 01:12:35.176
I've handled a lot more.

01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:37.222
I can do
whatever I put my mind to.

01:12:37.265 --> 01:12:38.354
Fair enough.

01:12:38.397 --> 01:12:39.616
So can I.

01:12:39.659 --> 01:12:41.835
But...

01:12:41.879 --> 01:12:44.316
sometimes I find myself
down on my luck.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:45.720
Doesn't mean
you have to go against

01:12:45.752 --> 01:12:47.450
what you want for yourself

01:12:47.493 --> 01:12:48.886
to take a little help

01:12:48.929 --> 01:12:51.018
from someone who wants
nothing in return.

01:12:51.062 --> 01:12:53.586
Especially if you need it.

01:12:53.630 --> 01:12:56.154
And you, miss...

01:12:56.197 --> 01:12:57.634
need it.

01:12:57.677 --> 01:13:00.158
And maybe one day
you'll be able to help me out.

01:13:03.248 --> 01:13:04.989
What are you thinking?

01:13:06.817 --> 01:13:08.688
Just that...

01:13:08.732 --> 01:13:10.386
I could use something to eat.

01:13:10.429 --> 01:13:12.431
How 'bout this?

01:13:12.475 --> 01:13:14.085
Let me take you out to eat,

01:13:14.128 --> 01:13:15.448
and you can get
whatever you want.

01:13:28.142 --> 01:13:29.361
Huh.

01:13:29.405 --> 01:13:32.146
I've never been to a mansion.

01:13:32.190 --> 01:13:34.322
And I've never
been to the circus.

01:13:34.366 --> 01:13:36.150
Do you actually live there?

01:13:36.194 --> 01:13:38.109
Well, there is no "there."

01:13:38.152 --> 01:13:39.197
We camp

01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:40.328
and travel.

01:13:40.372 --> 01:13:41.634
Spring to fall.

01:13:41.678 --> 01:13:43.593
Then, when the circus
is off for winter,

01:13:43.636 --> 01:13:44.898
I go back to my real home.

01:13:44.942 --> 01:13:46.378
And where's that?

01:13:46.422 --> 01:13:47.640
It's called Winnerow.

01:13:47.684 --> 01:13:49.337
The country,

01:13:49.381 --> 01:13:52.036
in West Virginia,
with my family.

01:13:54.342 --> 01:13:56.519
Maybe one day,
when we get married,

01:13:56.562 --> 01:13:57.694
I'll take you there.

01:13:57.737 --> 01:13:59.783
Oh, yeah? Married?

01:13:59.826 --> 01:14:03.830
Yeah. I had this strange vision
when I first saw you.

01:14:06.659 --> 01:14:08.748
I don't think
I'll ever get married.

01:14:08.792 --> 01:14:10.489
Why not?

01:14:10.533 --> 01:14:14.450
Because I've seen
what it's like.

01:14:14.493 --> 01:14:15.929
And I'm fine on my own.

01:14:15.973 --> 01:14:18.149
I'm fine on my own, too.

01:14:18.192 --> 01:14:20.107
But... who said people

01:14:20.151 --> 01:14:21.551
can't be fine on their own
together?

01:14:29.029 --> 01:14:29.987
Oh!

01:14:30.030 --> 01:14:31.423
Yeah! All right.

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:33.033
What did we win?

01:14:33.077 --> 01:14:34.600
We can choose.
You like cotton candy?

01:14:34.644 --> 01:14:36.036
I've never had any.

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:37.560
Then you're missing out on life!

01:14:37.603 --> 01:14:39.605
It's the best thing there is.

01:14:39.649 --> 01:14:41.477
And it's all yours,

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:44.175
if I could just get
a little kiss.

01:14:44.218 --> 01:14:45.655
Just a peck.

01:14:45.698 --> 01:14:48.832
It's your choice.
I'm not trying to pressure you.

01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:04.543
What part of heaven
did you drop out of

01:15:04.587 --> 01:15:05.762
to arrive here, Leigh?

01:15:18.775 --> 01:15:20.428
All you need to do is stay safe

01:15:20.472 --> 01:15:22.343
and get a good night's rest.

01:15:22.387 --> 01:15:25.259
I'll be sleeping
in my truck. Okay?

01:15:25.303 --> 01:15:28.349
Be right outside if you need me.

01:15:28.393 --> 01:15:30.264
It's cold.

01:15:34.181 --> 01:15:36.532
There's room on the bed.

01:15:38.359 --> 01:15:40.579
We don't have to touch.

01:15:42.538 --> 01:15:45.236
How 'bout I take the floor?

01:15:45.279 --> 01:15:48.544
But only if you insist
on me staying.

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:02.862
Wow.

01:16:02.906 --> 01:16:04.647
That doll looks
the spitting image of you.

01:16:04.690 --> 01:16:05.996
It's a portrait doll.

01:16:06.039 --> 01:16:07.563
I sat for it.

01:16:07.606 --> 01:16:09.565
Well, did they at least
name her after you?

01:16:09.608 --> 01:16:11.523
The resemblance
is kind of uncanny.

01:16:11.567 --> 01:16:13.917
Actually, I got to name her.

01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:16.310
Her name is Angel.

01:16:16.354 --> 01:16:19.357
That sure is what you are.

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:21.881
I think, from now on,

01:16:21.925 --> 01:16:23.325
that's what I'm gonna
call you, too.

01:16:24.492 --> 01:16:25.537
Angel.

01:16:26.799 --> 01:16:29.193
I'm gonna go get my stuff.

01:16:47.951 --> 01:16:50.388
I want you
to stay with me, Angel.

01:16:52.608 --> 01:16:55.393
Where?

01:16:55.436 --> 01:16:57.700
Back at my home.

01:16:57.743 --> 01:17:00.180
Just till you decide
what you want to do.

01:17:04.402 --> 01:17:06.143
Okay.

01:17:51.231 --> 01:17:53.581
Baby boy.

01:17:53.625 --> 01:17:54.539
You're home!

01:17:54.582 --> 01:17:55.582
Mama.

01:17:57.237 --> 01:17:58.282
Pops.

01:17:58.325 --> 01:18:00.327
Good to see you, boy.

01:18:00.371 --> 01:18:01.677
Now...

01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:02.895
who is this?

01:18:02.939 --> 01:18:04.114
This is Leigh...

01:18:04.157 --> 01:18:05.768
but I call her Angel.

01:18:07.770 --> 01:18:09.032
She's down on her luck

01:18:09.075 --> 01:18:10.642
and needs our help...

01:18:10.686 --> 01:18:12.252
and a place to stay.

01:18:15.821 --> 01:18:17.475
Well...

01:18:17.518 --> 01:18:19.148
we certainly can use some help
with the chores in return.

01:18:19.172 --> 01:18:20.652
I'd be happy to pitch in.

01:18:20.696 --> 01:18:21.958
Fine.

01:18:22.001 --> 01:18:23.089
You're just in time.

01:18:23.133 --> 01:18:24.438
We have some preserves
to put up.

01:18:25.439 --> 01:18:26.745
Come on in.

01:18:26.789 --> 01:18:28.747
Thank you.

01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:35.449
Please, don't judge.

01:18:35.493 --> 01:18:36.799
I wouldn't.

01:18:38.365 --> 01:18:40.237
Is it yours?

01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:41.673
I feel like
that's unimportant, Ma.

01:18:43.849 --> 01:18:45.851
Okay.

01:18:45.895 --> 01:18:48.245
Then I feel the same.

01:19:07.394 --> 01:19:09.266
When is an apple grouchy?

01:19:10.789 --> 01:19:13.052
When it's a crabapple.

01:19:35.379 --> 01:19:37.468
What?

01:19:38.774 --> 01:19:41.864
You know...

01:19:41.907 --> 01:19:44.954
I mean, what happened.

01:19:44.997 --> 01:19:46.912
I'm not a virgin anymore.

01:19:46.956 --> 01:19:49.480
It makes no difference, Leigh.

01:19:49.523 --> 01:19:51.874
You're with me now.

01:19:56.313 --> 01:19:57.444
Angel?

01:19:57.488 --> 01:19:59.011
Hmm?

01:19:59.055 --> 01:20:00.926
Would you marry me?

01:20:00.970 --> 01:20:02.754
What?

01:20:02.798 --> 01:20:04.625
I don't have a ring or anything,

01:20:04.669 --> 01:20:06.714
and I'm sorry about that...

01:20:06.758 --> 01:20:08.934
but what I can do

01:20:08.978 --> 01:20:10.196
is build us a house

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:11.894
and promise to love you

01:20:11.937 --> 01:20:14.505
and care for you and your baby

01:20:14.548 --> 01:20:16.028
forever,

01:20:16.072 --> 01:20:17.421
if you'll do me the honor.

01:20:17.464 --> 01:20:18.464
Are you serious?

01:20:19.510 --> 01:20:20.685
Yes! Of course!

01:20:25.298 --> 01:20:27.300
I, Luke Casteel,

01:20:27.344 --> 01:20:30.347
take you, my Angel...

01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:32.218
Leigh VanVoreen,

01:20:32.262 --> 01:20:34.699
to have and to hold
from this day forward,

01:20:34.742 --> 01:20:36.570
for better or worse,

01:20:36.614 --> 01:20:38.790
in sickness and in health,

01:20:38.834 --> 01:20:41.358
to love and cherish

01:20:41.401 --> 01:20:44.883
and... I'm adding something here,
is that okay?

01:20:44.927 --> 01:20:46.667
Of course.

01:20:46.711 --> 01:20:50.149
And by love and cherish
and hold, and all that,

01:20:50.193 --> 01:20:53.109
I mean as two equal parts
of a whole

01:20:53.152 --> 01:20:55.372
in the eyes of the Lord,

01:20:55.415 --> 01:20:57.548
until death do us part...

01:20:57.591 --> 01:20:59.158
or if she ever
just wants to leave me.

01:21:01.465 --> 01:21:06.209
Leigh, do you promise
to love and to cherish Luke

01:21:06.252 --> 01:21:08.298
till death do you part?

01:21:08.341 --> 01:21:10.039
I do.

01:21:10.082 --> 01:21:11.605
You may kiss your bride.

01:21:13.346 --> 01:21:15.479
Whoo!

01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:39.111
I love you, Luke.

01:21:39.155 --> 01:21:40.896
I love you, too, Angel.

01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:45.552
How's my other angel
doing in there?

01:21:45.596 --> 01:21:47.511
I can feel her kicking.

01:21:47.554 --> 01:21:48.991
Hard.

01:21:49.034 --> 01:21:50.514
Gets it from you.

01:22:25.636 --> 01:22:27.029
Where are you taking me?

01:22:27.072 --> 01:22:28.726
I'm not gonna tell you.

01:22:32.948 --> 01:22:34.819
So?

01:22:34.862 --> 01:22:37.343
What do you think, Leigh?

01:22:37.387 --> 01:22:39.215
It's nice.

01:22:39.258 --> 01:22:41.304
What is it?

01:22:41.347 --> 01:22:42.740
What is it?

01:22:42.783 --> 01:22:44.742
It's our new home.

01:22:44.785 --> 01:22:46.962
I mean, technically,
it's our homesite.

01:22:47.005 --> 01:22:48.398
But use your imagination.

01:22:48.441 --> 01:22:51.270
There's gonna be
a big log house,

01:22:51.314 --> 01:22:53.316
right here.

01:22:53.359 --> 01:22:55.753
Okay, a small log house,

01:22:55.796 --> 01:22:59.017
but still big enough for us
to start a family.

01:22:59.061 --> 01:23:00.714
'Course, I gotta get to work,

01:23:00.758 --> 01:23:02.499
but I finished clearing it,

01:23:02.542 --> 01:23:05.154
and my dad and I
are gonna start building soon,

01:23:05.197 --> 01:23:08.722
so that, by winter,
we'll be ready to move in.

01:23:10.028 --> 01:23:11.987
What does baby Casteel
think of the place?

01:23:12.030 --> 01:23:14.685
That it's beautiful.

01:23:16.121 --> 01:23:18.515
Now... it won't be a mansion.

01:23:18.558 --> 01:23:20.299
I don't need a mansion, Luke.

01:23:20.343 --> 01:23:21.257
I know, I know.

01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:23.302
Really.

01:23:23.346 --> 01:23:25.000
It wouldn't
make you any happier?

01:23:25.043 --> 01:23:27.132
None.

01:23:27.176 --> 01:23:29.221
I'm already
as happy as I can be.

01:23:31.310 --> 01:23:33.878
Okay.

01:23:33.921 --> 01:23:36.402
Then it'll be
a nice little place.

01:23:37.577 --> 01:23:39.492
I can smoke my pipe

01:23:39.536 --> 01:23:40.774
and you can knit
while our children...

01:23:40.798 --> 01:23:42.321
Oh!

01:23:42.365 --> 01:23:44.062
Angel?

01:23:44.106 --> 01:23:45.194
Are you okay?

01:23:45.237 --> 01:23:47.326
I think...

01:23:47.370 --> 01:23:49.067
Oh. I think...
I think my water just broke.

01:23:51.504 --> 01:23:53.071
Oh, I'm having this baby!

01:23:53.115 --> 01:23:54.290
Right now?

01:23:54.333 --> 01:23:55.769
Oh...

01:23:55.813 --> 01:23:57.253
Okay, we gotta get you home.
Come on.

01:23:57.293 --> 01:23:59.251
Ahh! I can't! I can't walk.

01:23:59.295 --> 01:24:01.166
Ooh... ooh.

01:24:01.210 --> 01:24:03.081
Hang on. Okay.

01:24:06.215 --> 01:24:07.477
Lie down.

01:24:10.436 --> 01:24:12.351
Uh...

01:24:12.395 --> 01:24:14.049
I'll go get the truck
and get Mama, okay?

01:24:14.092 --> 01:24:16.399
She knows how to deliver.

01:24:16.442 --> 01:24:18.357
I'm gonna be a dad, Angel!

01:24:18.401 --> 01:24:20.359
Baby, I love you
more than anything in the world.

01:24:20.403 --> 01:24:22.361
I love you, too, Luke.

01:24:25.016 --> 01:24:28.280
I feel like I've finally
found my piece of heaven.

01:24:28.324 --> 01:24:30.065
Fate is smiling on us.

01:24:30.108 --> 01:24:31.414
Ooh...

01:24:31.457 --> 01:24:33.459
Ahh!

01:24:35.157 --> 01:24:36.680
Okay.

01:24:36.723 --> 01:24:39.117
Okay, I'll be right back.

01:25:04.055 --> 01:25:05.796
"Dear Mr. Tatterton...

01:25:05.839 --> 01:25:08.929
I regret to inform you
that Leigh VanVoreen Casteel

01:25:08.973 --> 01:25:10.931
died in childbirth,

01:25:10.975 --> 01:25:14.021
giving birth
to a daughter named Heaven.

01:25:14.065 --> 01:25:15.588
I'm sending you her diary

01:25:15.632 --> 01:25:17.503
given to me by a man

01:25:17.547 --> 01:25:20.245
who said it gave him
too much pain to keep it,

01:25:20.289 --> 01:25:21.551
Luke Casteel."

01:25:24.641 --> 01:25:25.642
Hey, Annie?

01:25:25.685 --> 01:25:28.123
Funeral's about to start.

01:25:28.166 --> 01:25:30.603
Uh, yeah,
I'll be there in a minute.

01:25:30.647 --> 01:25:32.562
Okay.

01:26:08.859 --> 01:26:11.427
Were you able
to find anything out?

01:26:11.470 --> 01:26:13.429
That, as a young girl,

01:26:13.472 --> 01:26:15.692
she had the courage to escape
the only world she knew

01:26:15.735 --> 01:26:16.867
and become her own woman.

01:26:16.910 --> 01:26:18.999
She sounds remarkable.

01:26:19.043 --> 01:26:20.914
She was.

01:26:20.958 --> 01:26:22.829
I see where you get it.

01:26:25.354 --> 01:26:27.182
Come on.
