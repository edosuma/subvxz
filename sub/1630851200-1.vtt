WEBVTT

00:46.246 --> 00:51.084
My share of mistakes

01:13.239 --> 01:17.777
To the bone

01:22.415 --> 01:27.153
Never too late

01:34.661 --> 01:39.666
To find her

01:58.785 --> 02:04.124
Could be rocky

02:04.190 --> 02:10.263
Than being alone

02:10.330 --> 02:15.168
Never too late

02:21.541 --> 02:23.143
It's 10:30, Mike.

02:24.043 --> 02:25.612
You're late.

02:25.678 --> 02:26.980
For what?

02:28.281 --> 02:31.885
Okay. All right.

02:33.887 --> 02:35.188
Back when we had winners,

02:35.288 --> 02:37.690
I was afraid to lose you
to the competition.

02:37.790 --> 02:40.059
Five times you won
the All-American Futurity

02:40.160 --> 02:41.961
and every goddamn time
I thought,

02:42.028 --> 02:44.063
"Oh, I won't be able
to keep Mike.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.900
Somebody's gonna grab him."

02:47.000 --> 02:49.736
But that was a long time ago,
wasn't it?

02:49.836 --> 02:53.139
Yeah. That was before
the accident.

02:54.307 --> 02:55.842
Before the pills.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.812
Before the booze.

03:01.848 --> 03:04.751
You look out there
in that barn now,

03:04.851 --> 03:07.220
a string
of second-rate horses.

03:08.488 --> 03:11.257
Kind of like my trainer,
isn't it?

03:11.357 --> 03:14.594
I'm not afraid of losing you
to anybody now.

03:14.694 --> 03:16.563
You're a loss to no one.

03:18.698 --> 03:20.333
It's time for new blood.

03:24.737 --> 03:27.207
Yeah, I can see that.

03:27.273 --> 03:29.576
And you know
what you're late for?

03:29.676 --> 03:30.843
What?

03:30.910 --> 03:32.545
Clearing out your locker.

03:32.612 --> 03:34.781
Why don't you do that
on the way out?

03:39.886 --> 03:41.521
You gonna say anything?

03:43.456 --> 03:44.724
No.

03:44.791 --> 03:46.693
I was just gonna say, "Howard,

03:46.759 --> 03:49.696
I've always thought of you
as a small, weak,

03:49.762 --> 03:52.232
and gutless man."

03:52.298 --> 03:55.935
But, you know,
there's no reason to be rude.

05:26.993 --> 05:28.895
So, you don't lock your doors?

05:30.330 --> 05:32.732
Ain't got nothing
worth stealing.

05:37.503 --> 05:38.571
What's up?

05:38.671 --> 05:42.175
You're just killing time
in here or what?

05:43.343 --> 05:44.877
You look awful.

05:44.977 --> 05:48.915
Well, you've looked horrible
longer, so I guess you win.

05:50.516 --> 05:51.718
Yeah.

05:54.687 --> 05:56.055
What do you want?

05:57.924 --> 06:00.493
You remember I had a son?

06:00.560 --> 06:01.594
Rafael.

06:03.529 --> 06:04.664
Yeah.

06:04.731 --> 06:08.768
That's him,
like, at five or six.

06:08.868 --> 06:11.371
Well, he's 13 now,
and I wanna
get him out of Mexico.

06:11.437 --> 06:13.239
I wanna get him up here.
I wanna do the right thing.

06:13.339 --> 06:15.007
I want him to live with me.

06:15.074 --> 06:17.877
What does his mother think
about that?

06:18.845 --> 06:22.014
Yeah, well, Leta,

06:22.081 --> 06:24.617
-she's a nutcase.
-Oh.

06:24.717 --> 06:27.754
I mean, she was fun
at a party, but...

06:28.888 --> 06:30.223
and she gave me him.

06:30.289 --> 06:32.592
Yeah.

06:32.692 --> 06:35.862
But he's in trouble.
Mike, the kid's in trouble.

06:35.928 --> 06:37.797
And I gotta get him
out of there.

06:37.897 --> 06:40.967
Yeah. Why don't you call
the authorities, then?

06:41.067 --> 06:43.136
I can't go to the authorities.

06:43.236 --> 06:46.372
I have legal issues.
I can't go back into Mexico.

06:47.473 --> 06:49.242
He's being abused.

06:49.308 --> 06:50.943
How do you know that?

06:51.043 --> 06:52.612
Well, I don't know it
directly from him,

06:52.712 --> 06:53.813
if that's what
you're asking me,

06:53.913 --> 06:55.882
but I know that.

06:55.948 --> 06:57.617
I know it
from people around her,

06:57.717 --> 06:59.152
and she's a mess.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.554
And she's letting the kid
be abused.

07:01.621 --> 07:04.824
Uh... Well, I don't know
what you want from me

07:04.924 --> 07:06.959
'cause, you know...

07:07.059 --> 07:09.162
You want me
to go down there
and kidnap him?

07:09.262 --> 07:10.563
Bring him out of there?

07:10.630 --> 07:13.065
It's not kidnapping
if he's your kid.

07:13.132 --> 07:14.500
It isn't my kid,

07:14.600 --> 07:16.636
so I don't think he'll go
with me in the first place.

07:16.736 --> 07:20.106
Yes, he would.
He'll listen to you, Mike.

07:20.173 --> 07:21.808
I know he will.

07:21.908 --> 07:23.276
He'll know
the minute he sees you,

07:23.342 --> 07:24.677
you're a real cowboy.

07:24.777 --> 07:26.612
He'll listen to you.
Tell him about the house.

07:26.679 --> 07:28.748
Tell him he's gonna have
the run of the whole ranch.

07:28.815 --> 07:31.818
He's gonna have his own horse.
Tell him that.

07:31.918 --> 07:34.987
It's every boy's dream.

07:35.087 --> 07:39.859
Well, I think you got dozens
of guys here who could do it

07:39.959 --> 07:41.527
and I'm not really the kind...

07:41.627 --> 07:44.263
You know what?
You owe me, Mike.

07:44.330 --> 07:47.433
I was standing here,
looking at all this,

07:47.500 --> 07:51.137
thinking about
making the payments
on this place for you.

07:51.204 --> 07:54.140
About helping you not lose it
after you...

07:55.341 --> 07:56.843
After you lost her
and the boy...

07:56.943 --> 08:00.379
You know how many people
told me to stop doing that?

08:00.480 --> 08:02.381
To just cut you loose.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.651
I said, "No. You know what?
I owe Mike that much."

08:06.953 --> 08:08.554
But I think you owe me
a little bit,

08:08.654 --> 08:10.656
and you gave me your word.

08:10.723 --> 08:13.192
And that used to
mean something, Mike.

08:14.660 --> 08:15.995
Yeah.

08:17.396 --> 08:18.731
I owe ya.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.834
All right.

08:22.902 --> 08:24.237
There's cash
in this envelope.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.373
Quite a bit of cash
for travel and expenses.

08:27.473 --> 08:28.741
I've got her address on here

08:28.841 --> 08:30.309
and this is a map of the area

08:30.376 --> 08:32.478
in Mexico City
she's living in.

08:33.746 --> 08:38.417
That's Rafo,
like I said, about six.

08:38.518 --> 08:43.356
He's 13 nearly now,
and he's gonna be taller.

08:45.157 --> 08:46.592
-Thank you.
-Okay.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.611
Buenos dias,  girls.

09:05.711 --> 09:07.513
Hello.
-Hi.

09:07.580 --> 09:08.948
So, where are you headed?

09:09.048 --> 09:11.217
Playa.
We're gonna hit the beach.

09:13.619 --> 09:15.087
Which beach?

09:15.187 --> 09:18.524
I mean, there are many
beautiful beaches in Mexico.

09:18.591 --> 09:20.126
However many we can in a week.

09:20.226 --> 09:22.695
I bet you will.
-

09:24.564 --> 09:26.933
Enjoy your stay
in Mexico, girls.

09:27.033 --> 09:28.801
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

09:28.901 --> 09:31.404
-

09:37.076 --> 09:39.478
What's your purpose
for entering Mexico?

09:39.579 --> 09:42.048
Uh, a holiday.

09:42.114 --> 09:44.417
Can I see your paperwork?

09:45.551 --> 09:47.286
I'm actually with them.

09:50.089 --> 09:51.457
Just you?

09:51.557 --> 09:53.826
Just me.

09:53.926 --> 09:55.494
Enjoy your stay in Mexico.

09:55.595 --> 09:56.796
Thank you.

11:16.575 --> 11:19.578
Why the hell would a kid
ever wanna leave this place?

12:08.894 --> 12:12.031
Hey, be respectful, old man.

12:12.098 --> 12:13.265
Take off your hat.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.558
Usually
when a woman laughs like that,

12:39.625 --> 12:41.327
a man's fly is open.

12:41.427 --> 12:44.463
That's the only thing
that's not on the table.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.101
You're good.

12:54.640 --> 12:56.675
Aw. Oh, no.

13:03.182 --> 13:07.653
Is this your family,
Michael Milo?

13:08.788 --> 13:12.858
Yeah. From a long time ago.

13:12.958 --> 13:13.993
Hmm.

13:15.161 --> 13:17.797
You also have a picture
of my son

13:19.298 --> 13:20.966
from a long time ago.

13:21.033 --> 13:22.468
I can explain that.

13:22.535 --> 13:25.104
No, you needn't.

13:25.171 --> 13:28.474
You think you're the first
my ex-husband sent?

13:30.976 --> 13:33.212
The first one is in jail.

13:33.312 --> 13:35.648
Beastly man
with no manners.

13:36.715 --> 13:39.118
The second
was more amiable.

13:41.453 --> 13:43.656
Couldn't find Rafo and left.

13:45.391 --> 13:48.060
Tell me, cowboy,

13:48.160 --> 13:51.564
why does his father
really want him now?

13:51.664 --> 13:54.466
He has no real love
for the boy.

13:54.533 --> 13:57.803
Well, maybe he's trying
to change all that.

13:57.870 --> 14:01.473
You're picturing
some innocent kid.

14:01.540 --> 14:04.476
Like in that photo.

14:04.543 --> 14:05.811
A nice, respectful boy

14:05.878 --> 14:08.414
who wears clean clothes
to school,

14:08.514 --> 14:11.217
and sings in church.

14:12.484 --> 14:15.221
I guarantee you
that isn't the case.

14:16.488 --> 14:19.091
My son is wild.

14:19.191 --> 14:22.194
An animal
who lives in the gutter.

14:22.261 --> 14:26.932
Gambling, stealing,
cockfighting, at the...

14:28.067 --> 14:30.002
At the  calle Choca.

14:32.671 --> 14:34.506
Take him.

14:34.573 --> 14:36.876
Take him
if you can find him.

14:37.676 --> 14:39.612
He's a monster.

14:41.747 --> 14:45.117
You have made a long trip
for nothing.

14:48.287 --> 14:51.123
I don't know
where my son is now.

14:51.223 --> 14:53.459
He's like his father.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.895
He runs away.

14:57.062 --> 14:59.098
He hates his father.

14:59.198 --> 15:01.033
He hates me.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.804
So, go home, Mr. Mike.

15:07.206 --> 15:08.407
Go home.

15:10.276 --> 15:12.111
When did you give up?

15:15.748 --> 15:17.049
No matter what people say,

15:17.116 --> 15:19.618
some aren't cut out
to be parents.

15:25.157 --> 15:27.426
Have a drink with me, hmm?

15:30.162 --> 15:32.631
-

15:37.603 --> 15:39.905
No, I got a job to do.

15:41.307 --> 15:45.444
Well, then, good luck.
You'll need it.

16:31.156 --> 16:32.491
Hey, Rafo.

16:57.883 --> 16:58.984
Oh, shit!

17:00.019 --> 17:01.220
Shit, shit.

17:34.520 --> 17:35.954
Hey, Rafo,
you can come out now.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.423
The cops are gone.

17:39.091 --> 17:41.126
Where the hell are you?

17:46.632 --> 17:48.133
You can come out now.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.069
I'm a friend of the family.

17:53.972 --> 17:55.641
Okay. Come on.

17:56.308 --> 17:57.376
Come here.

17:58.143 --> 17:59.912
Hey, hey, come on.

18:02.314 --> 18:04.550
Bad chicken.
No, no! Hey, hey!

18:04.616 --> 18:05.651
Ah.

18:07.753 --> 18:10.055
All right,
you little bastard.

18:10.122 --> 18:11.757
Come on out.

18:12.558 --> 18:14.993
I'm gonna count to five.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.396
I'm gonna
wring this chicken's neck.

18:18.397 --> 18:19.898
You got that?

18:20.432 --> 18:22.000
One.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.435
Two.

18:23.502 --> 18:24.937
Three.

18:25.003 --> 18:26.405
Four.

18:26.472 --> 18:28.607
-Give me my rooster!
-Five.

18:28.674 --> 18:31.410
Not until we talk, Rafo.

18:31.477 --> 18:32.744
You know my name?

18:32.811 --> 18:34.913
How did you find me?

18:34.980 --> 18:36.815
I found you
because your mother told me

18:36.915 --> 18:38.684
where you were.
That's why.

18:38.784 --> 18:42.321
If she sold me to you,
you're a fool.

18:42.421 --> 18:44.923
Touch me and I'll kick
your ass, old man.

18:44.990 --> 18:46.592
What the hell
you talking about?

18:46.658 --> 18:48.794
You are some perverted friend
of my mother

18:48.861 --> 18:50.829
from one of her parties.

18:50.929 --> 18:52.698
Perverted old man.

18:52.798 --> 18:56.034
Hey. You're talking
to the wrong person.

18:56.135 --> 18:59.705
I'm here representing your dad
who wants to see you.

19:01.039 --> 19:02.107
Howard Polk.

19:03.475 --> 19:06.211
I work for him, that's all.

19:06.311 --> 19:09.181
You are a cowboy?
A ranch hand?

19:10.048 --> 19:11.283
Yeah.

19:11.350 --> 19:14.786
That's right.
I've done a little of that.

19:15.721 --> 19:17.990
Okay, talk.

19:18.724 --> 19:19.858
Not here.

19:21.059 --> 19:22.194
Not here.

19:29.234 --> 19:30.569
You're joking, yes?

19:30.669 --> 19:33.005
No, not joking.

19:33.071 --> 19:35.541
My father, he wants me.

19:35.641 --> 19:37.509
Well, you're his only kid.

19:37.576 --> 19:39.978
And he sent you for me?

19:40.045 --> 19:41.146
Yep.

19:41.213 --> 19:42.247
You're a liar.

19:42.347 --> 19:45.083
My father hasn't seen me
for years.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.352
Why does he want
to see me now?

19:47.419 --> 19:49.922
Well, he wants to see you,
that's all.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.324
He, uh... He misses you.

19:54.059 --> 19:55.727
You're full of shit.

19:55.827 --> 19:57.095
My father doesn't want me.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.864
He never even called
on my birthdays.

19:58.931 --> 19:59.998
Look at that.

20:02.768 --> 20:04.169
It's me when I was little.

20:04.236 --> 20:06.438
Yeah, that's it.

20:06.538 --> 20:07.873
Same guy.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.108
He gave you that?

20:10.209 --> 20:11.210
He did.

20:12.578 --> 20:17.115
If my father wants me back,
why didn't he telephone?

20:17.216 --> 20:19.751
He sent you,
some  apestoso viejo.

20:19.851 --> 20:23.589
I don't know what that means,
but I don't like it.

20:23.689 --> 20:24.957
When I was little,

20:25.057 --> 20:27.593
my father said he would
give me a special horse.

20:30.596 --> 20:31.897
He never did.

20:33.265 --> 20:34.967
He's a liar.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.969
Eh, just a little late,
that's all.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.804
That doesn't mean he's a liar.

20:38.904 --> 20:41.273
But he's gonna
make it up to you now.

20:41.373 --> 20:42.874
He's got a big ranch.

20:42.941 --> 20:44.710
He's got horses, cattle.

20:44.776 --> 20:46.311
In fact,
he's got hundreds of horses.

20:46.411 --> 20:48.714
You'll be able
to ride yourself silly.

20:48.780 --> 20:50.716
-Hundreds of horses?
-Yeah.

20:50.782 --> 20:53.252
Even owns a rodeo up there.

20:54.753 --> 20:55.988
Rodeo?

20:56.088 --> 20:57.656
Hundreds of horses...

20:58.290 --> 20:59.658
He's a big boss!

20:59.758 --> 21:02.628
Yeah, he's a big boss.
That's what I'm telling you.

21:02.728 --> 21:03.729
Maybe I'll go.

21:03.795 --> 21:04.830
-Just for a while.
-Yeah.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.498
Good. Good, I think so.

21:06.598 --> 21:08.233
If I don't like it,
I will say,

21:08.300 --> 21:09.501
"To hell with him,"
and come back.

21:09.601 --> 21:10.969
Yeah, that's right.

21:11.069 --> 21:13.305
If you don't like it,
to hell with it.

21:14.506 --> 21:16.408
Okay. Deal.

21:16.475 --> 21:17.809
I can bring my rooster?

21:17.909 --> 21:20.145
Yeah. I don't see why not.

21:20.912 --> 21:22.414
Hey, Macho, come.

21:24.816 --> 21:25.851
Where ya going?

21:25.951 --> 21:27.352
I have to get my things.

21:27.452 --> 21:29.354
No, stay here.

21:32.591 --> 21:33.625
Shit.

22:12.497 --> 22:14.566
What can I say?

22:16.168 --> 22:17.536
I can't believe it.

22:18.804 --> 22:20.405
Where did you find him?

22:21.540 --> 22:23.241
Right where you said.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.243
At the cock fights.

22:26.845 --> 22:29.147
And where is he?

22:29.214 --> 22:31.917
He said he was gonna go out
and get his stuff.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.753
You poor fool.

22:37.356 --> 22:39.257
Yeah.
-

22:39.358 --> 22:40.892
-Ah.
- Well...

22:40.992 --> 22:42.828
This time...

22:42.894 --> 22:45.664
This time
you'll have a drink with me.

22:52.437 --> 22:56.408
Ah... you really thought
Rafo would go with you, hmm?

22:57.876 --> 22:59.411
Mm, maybe he will.

23:05.684 --> 23:06.685
Here.

23:08.720 --> 23:09.755
Cheers.

23:16.395 --> 23:20.132
Hmm. Come. Let's celebrate.

23:25.303 --> 23:26.371
Hmm.

23:27.773 --> 23:29.207
Tell me something...

23:35.747 --> 23:37.482
What are we celebrating?

23:39.050 --> 23:40.752
Anything.

23:41.920 --> 23:44.122
I'm up for anything.

23:45.323 --> 23:46.391
Corazon.

23:54.966 --> 23:56.435
Uh...

23:57.102 --> 23:58.103
I, uh...

23:59.304 --> 24:01.306
-I don't know.
-

24:01.406 --> 24:04.843
I think I better
get the hell out of here.

24:04.943 --> 24:08.246
Otherwise, this job
ain't gonna be finished.

24:09.014 --> 24:10.148
You dare...

24:10.248 --> 24:12.851
You dare insult me
in my own home?

24:12.951 --> 24:14.252
No, I didn't mean
to insult you.

24:14.319 --> 24:16.254
-I just...
-

24:16.321 --> 24:17.656
Okay.

24:17.756 --> 24:19.357
Hey.

24:19.458 --> 24:22.427
You think I'm a whore?
Is that what you think?

24:24.496 --> 24:27.032
Hey, I'm talking to you.
Don't go!

24:28.200 --> 24:30.702
One more step
and you're finished.

24:30.802 --> 24:32.971
I'll call the  Federales
right now.

24:33.038 --> 24:34.306
Give them your name,

24:34.372 --> 24:36.208
and you'll be arrested
for kidnapping.

24:36.308 --> 24:38.677
And spend
the rest of your life
in a Mexican prison.

24:38.777 --> 24:40.879
How do you like that?

24:40.979 --> 24:43.048
You don't like that, do you?

24:45.116 --> 24:46.985
Rafo is mine.

24:47.052 --> 24:49.821
He's mine and he stays.

24:49.888 --> 24:51.189
You understand?

24:51.289 --> 24:55.327
He's my property,
and nobody takes my property.

24:55.393 --> 24:57.562
His father ran away from us.

24:57.662 --> 25:01.566
He had his chance,
but he left us here.

25:01.666 --> 25:04.336
He left him with me.

25:05.670 --> 25:07.038
You have exactly five minutes

25:07.138 --> 25:08.907
to get in your vehicle
and leave Mexico City.

25:09.007 --> 25:10.509
Do we understand each other?

25:10.575 --> 25:12.143
Get out.

25:13.211 --> 25:14.913
Get out now.

25:16.481 --> 25:18.316
Lucas.
- Take him out.

25:39.037 --> 25:40.071
Okay.

26:15.073 --> 26:16.107
The hell?

26:17.075 --> 26:18.610
Hello,  gringo.

26:18.710 --> 26:21.279
I guess I fell asleep, yes?

26:21.379 --> 26:22.380
Get out.

26:23.081 --> 26:24.082
What?

26:25.483 --> 26:26.618
Get out.

26:31.456 --> 26:32.591
-Get out.
-What?

26:32.657 --> 26:33.925
Get out, I said.

26:35.727 --> 26:36.728
What?

26:37.395 --> 26:38.563
What the...

26:38.630 --> 26:40.265
-I said, out.
-

26:41.399 --> 26:42.734
Get out, you're not going.

26:42.801 --> 26:45.003
-Say who?
-Says me.
Says your mother.

26:45.103 --> 26:48.006
-I'm going with you.
-No, you're not
going with me.

26:48.106 --> 26:49.975
I said I am going.

26:50.075 --> 26:51.343
You're staying.

26:51.443 --> 26:52.978
If you go without me,
do you know what I'll do?

26:53.078 --> 26:55.013
-What'll you do?
-I'll go to the police.

26:55.113 --> 26:56.314
-Yeah?
-Not here.

26:56.414 --> 26:58.183
In the next town
where they don't know me.

26:58.283 --> 27:00.785
I'll go to the  Federales
and I'll tell them

27:00.852 --> 27:04.623
I was raped by a dirty  gringo
in a truck from Texas.

27:04.689 --> 27:06.524
You're sick.
What are you gonna do

27:06.625 --> 27:08.026
when they get you
to the hospital

27:08.126 --> 27:10.028
and the doc wants to shove
his hand up your ass

27:10.128 --> 27:11.696
to give you an examination?

27:11.796 --> 27:13.765
Not so good, huh, sonny?

27:13.832 --> 27:16.968
Get your ass out of here.
Jesus! Hit the highway.

27:17.035 --> 27:19.938
Then, I'll walk
like a cripple. Like this...

27:21.272 --> 27:24.609
And I'll say your truck,
you hit me and run away.

27:24.676 --> 27:26.544
Jesus Christ.

27:26.645 --> 27:29.280
I'll tell them that this thing

27:30.348 --> 27:31.483
is not yours.

27:31.549 --> 27:33.018
It's stolen.

27:33.118 --> 27:36.021
Jesus!
You're sick as a dog.

27:36.121 --> 27:38.456
Get out of here. You ain't...

27:38.523 --> 27:39.991
Jerk off.

27:51.202 --> 27:53.138
All right, where's the wallet?

27:53.204 --> 27:54.239
Where's what?

27:54.339 --> 27:55.907
My wallet. Give it here.

27:56.007 --> 27:57.876
We go and I tell you, okay?

27:57.976 --> 27:59.911
Look, the only place
you're gonna go

28:00.011 --> 28:01.479
is the hospital.

28:01.546 --> 28:03.515
Now give me
the goddamn wallet.

28:03.581 --> 28:05.383
Ah. You get too angry.

28:05.483 --> 28:07.652
It's not good for you
at your age.

28:07.719 --> 28:09.521
Give me the wallet now!

28:09.587 --> 28:10.755
Eat shit.

28:10.855 --> 28:12.357
What are you talking about,
"eat shit"?

28:14.192 --> 28:15.260
Yeah.

28:16.494 --> 28:17.562
Yeah.

28:17.662 --> 28:18.563
You're pretty quick
for old man.

28:18.663 --> 28:19.764
"Eat shit." Yeah.

28:19.864 --> 28:22.000
Okay,
I'll make a deal with you.

28:22.067 --> 28:23.601
What deal?

28:23.702 --> 28:26.438
I give your wallet,
you take me to the border.

28:26.538 --> 28:30.075
Only to the border.
Then I get across
by myself.

28:32.744 --> 28:34.846
No deal. No dice.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.519
I want to go
with my father.

28:57.902 --> 29:00.705
All right. Get in the back.

29:09.781 --> 29:11.316
I want you
to take this chicken,

29:11.416 --> 29:13.284
tie his leg back down there
so it doesn't...

29:13.384 --> 29:15.754
I don't want him crapping
on the upholstery here.

29:15.820 --> 29:16.888
No.

29:16.955 --> 29:18.323
What do you mean, "no"?

29:18.423 --> 29:21.059
No, and he's not a chicken.
His name is Macho.

29:21.126 --> 29:23.795
I don't care if his name
is Colonel Sanders.

29:23.895 --> 29:25.663
Just get his ass back there.

29:25.764 --> 29:26.765
He's Macho.

29:26.831 --> 29:27.999
You know what it means,
"macho"?

29:28.099 --> 29:29.234
It means "strong."

29:29.968 --> 29:31.169
Come on, Macho.

29:31.770 --> 29:32.771
Yeah.

29:33.571 --> 29:34.572
Shit.

29:46.084 --> 29:49.187
It's bad to have a fighter,
a champion,

29:49.287 --> 29:51.189
with his leg tied all day.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.359
Gringo,

29:54.459 --> 29:56.661
you look a smart man to me.

29:56.761 --> 29:58.496
So...

29:58.596 --> 30:01.166
I'll make a deal with you.

30:01.266 --> 30:03.535
Yeah? What kind of a deal?

30:03.635 --> 30:05.303
If Macho sits with us,

30:05.370 --> 30:06.471
when he fights,

30:06.538 --> 30:09.040
I'll give you half
of the money.

30:09.140 --> 30:13.711
The day Macho sits up here
is the day I barbecue his ass.

30:15.313 --> 30:17.882
It's not good for his spirit.

30:20.385 --> 30:23.121
Well, I'm really worried
about that.

30:23.955 --> 30:27.158
But he's strong now.

30:27.225 --> 30:29.327
When I first find him,

30:29.394 --> 30:31.729
he'd lose every fight.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.865
He was on the ground.

30:33.965 --> 30:35.667
His leg broke.

30:35.733 --> 30:40.338
So, I took care of him,
and I said,

30:40.405 --> 30:44.309
"Stand up, you bastard.
Fight!"

30:45.343 --> 30:47.679
He killed a very big rooster.

30:48.580 --> 30:50.148
From that time,

30:51.015 --> 30:53.017
he's Macho.

30:53.084 --> 30:54.719
A champion.

30:54.819 --> 30:56.421
That's the most
exciting thing

30:56.521 --> 30:57.989
I've ever heard.

31:05.230 --> 31:07.065
Why don't we sleep
in the truck?

31:07.165 --> 31:08.499
Yeah.

31:08.566 --> 31:11.603
'Cause we can sleep out here
in the wide-open spaces.

31:11.703 --> 31:12.937
The air is nice and clean.

31:13.037 --> 31:15.206
It's not like it is
in the cities.

31:15.273 --> 31:16.708
It's beautiful.

31:16.774 --> 31:19.277
I think something else maybe.

31:19.377 --> 31:20.411
What?

31:21.012 --> 31:22.380
Like

31:22.447 --> 31:25.383
when I fall asleep,
you'll drive away without me.

31:26.050 --> 31:28.019
Yeah.

31:28.086 --> 31:30.722
I'm not gonna run away
without you, kid.

31:30.788 --> 31:32.757
Just go to sleep.

31:34.859 --> 31:36.094
What's the matter
with this guy?

31:36.194 --> 31:38.463
He's got something
on his eye here.

31:38.563 --> 31:40.198
Got something in right here.

31:40.265 --> 31:42.033
-Wait, wait a second.

31:43.034 --> 31:44.936
Oh.
-Yeah. I got it.

31:45.036 --> 31:46.070
Very good.

31:46.137 --> 31:47.639
Go ahead.

31:47.739 --> 31:50.608
You're a  veterinario?

31:50.708 --> 31:52.377
No. No,  veterinario.

31:52.443 --> 31:55.480
I've just loved animals
all my life.

31:56.414 --> 31:58.049
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

31:58.783 --> 32:00.451
At rodeo?

32:00.551 --> 32:01.953
Yeah, rodeo.

32:02.053 --> 32:03.888
Working on ranches

32:03.955 --> 32:07.825
and working with horses
and stuff especially.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.428
Well, so I think
he'll be fine.

32:11.629 --> 32:14.132
Macho. His name is Macho.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.634
Whatever.

32:16.734 --> 32:18.469
What's wrong with that?

32:18.569 --> 32:19.671
Nothing.

32:19.771 --> 32:22.573
Guy wants to name
his cock "Macho"...

32:22.640 --> 32:25.076
It's okay by me.

32:26.744 --> 32:29.247
He's macho, like me.

32:29.314 --> 32:30.949
Very strong rooster.

32:31.015 --> 32:32.417
Everyone wants him.

32:32.483 --> 32:34.686
One even stole him from me.

32:34.786 --> 32:38.756
Yeah, your mother says you've
stolen a few things yourself.

32:38.823 --> 32:40.458
Cars and such.

32:40.525 --> 32:43.695
When we get up in the States,
you touch a man's vehicle,

32:43.795 --> 32:46.097
that doesn't go over.

32:46.164 --> 32:49.801
Yeah. I'll remember
when we get to Texas.

32:49.867 --> 32:51.469
Especially in Texas.

32:51.536 --> 32:55.974
And you can watch
all that "macho" crap
up there too.

32:56.040 --> 32:58.176
Nobody likes that stuff.

33:10.655 --> 33:12.390
How'd you get the bruises?

33:15.727 --> 33:18.396
Being on the street
cause all that?

33:19.831 --> 33:21.032
Sometimes.

33:22.633 --> 33:27.405
And sometimes
when I go home,
it's worse.

33:27.505 --> 33:30.675
That's why I stay
on the streets.

33:30.742 --> 33:32.910
All the bad stuff
happens at home.

33:37.482 --> 33:39.550
My mom hates me.

33:42.253 --> 33:44.355
You want to know why?

33:44.422 --> 33:46.057
Not really.

33:47.492 --> 33:50.094
She bring home
a strange man today,

33:50.194 --> 33:52.597
another strange man tomorrow,

33:52.697 --> 33:55.233
and she said
I should call them "Uncle."

33:55.333 --> 33:57.769
And I say to her,

33:57.869 --> 34:00.038
"How many men
can I call 'Uncle'?"

34:01.172 --> 34:03.708
So, she hates me.

34:05.076 --> 34:06.511
And Aurelio,

34:07.378 --> 34:09.180
he was in prison.

34:09.247 --> 34:13.217
Sometimes he sells drugs
and brings her pills and dope.

34:15.086 --> 34:17.955
One time I spit on him.

34:18.056 --> 34:20.591
He hits me
to teach me manners

34:21.392 --> 34:23.094
and I said to him...

34:25.763 --> 34:27.298
"Don't teach me manners

34:27.398 --> 34:30.868
when you're in bed
with my mom,
where she sleep."

34:30.935 --> 34:34.138
So, I say, to hell with that.

34:34.238 --> 34:37.208
I make a few pesos
with Macho for myself

34:38.910 --> 34:41.079
and I do what I want.

34:42.580 --> 34:44.248
On the street,

34:44.315 --> 34:45.983
I trust no one.

34:47.718 --> 34:49.387
But it's safer than at home.

34:57.395 --> 35:00.164
You can never trust no one.

35:36.534 --> 35:37.802
We're gonna take

35:37.869 --> 35:39.770
a little bit
of a different route here.

35:41.038 --> 35:43.708
-Federales  are there.
-Oh, shit.

35:43.808 --> 35:45.643
We gotta go down this road.

35:45.710 --> 35:46.978
What do they want?

35:47.044 --> 35:48.846
Well, they probably
wanted you.

35:50.281 --> 35:51.682
We'll stay away from them.

35:51.782 --> 35:53.217
What are we doing?

35:53.317 --> 35:56.687
We go off,
take this road here.

35:57.655 --> 35:58.789
All the way around,

35:58.856 --> 35:59.991
and we won't have to deal
with them.

36:00.057 --> 36:02.827
No good.
It's bump, bump, bump.

36:04.162 --> 36:06.964
Bit more like
jail, jail, jail.

36:20.144 --> 36:22.046
-Hi.
-

36:22.146 --> 36:25.583
We brought
our own red rooster
with us, see?

36:25.683 --> 36:27.251
In your honor.

36:27.351 --> 36:28.486
Gracias.

36:28.553 --> 36:32.089
Uh, I'm gonna have
a  cerveza blanca

36:32.190 --> 36:33.491
and he'll have a...

36:39.430 --> 36:41.065
What's Amarillo?

36:41.165 --> 36:44.669
Uh, nothing.
Just something I drink.

36:44.735 --> 36:46.604
Oh, okay.

36:49.173 --> 36:50.208
Gracias.

36:52.543 --> 36:54.378
It's tequila.

36:55.446 --> 36:57.582
-Tequila.
-Yeah.

36:57.682 --> 36:59.850
You're not gonna drink
any tequila.

36:59.917 --> 37:01.452
But I want it.

37:01.552 --> 37:03.354
I don't care.
You're not gonna drink it,
not with me.

37:04.956 --> 37:06.857
I drink tequila
once and I never got sick.

37:06.924 --> 37:09.193
Yeah, well,
when you're with your dad,
up above the border,

37:09.260 --> 37:10.628
you can drink battery acid,

37:10.728 --> 37:12.897
but you're not gonna
drink tequila with me.

37:12.964 --> 37:15.099
An Orange Crush,  por favor.

37:16.467 --> 37:19.036
Yeah, that's better.

37:21.105 --> 37:22.640
I'll be back.

37:22.740 --> 37:23.808
Where are you going?

37:23.908 --> 37:25.276
Make a little call.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.291
Yeah, hello.

37:40.391 --> 37:42.159
I found the boy.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.327
Yes!

37:43.427 --> 37:46.163
Shit, that's great!
That's great!

37:46.264 --> 37:47.465
It wasn't easy,

37:47.565 --> 37:49.500
but I found him
and we're on our way.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.769
Not without bumps,
but we're on our way.

37:51.836 --> 37:53.571
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

37:53.638 --> 37:54.905
I knew you'd find him.

37:54.972 --> 37:56.907
I knew I did the right thing
sending you.

37:56.974 --> 38:00.745
Not like
those other two guys
you sent down here.

38:00.811 --> 38:03.014
Thanks a lot for that.

38:03.114 --> 38:05.616
I'm gonna be calling you
along the way

38:05.683 --> 38:08.486
and you'll be playing it
straight with me,
understand?

38:08.586 --> 38:10.988
Okay. All right.

38:12.123 --> 38:14.025
Just get him
back up here, okay?

38:14.125 --> 38:16.127
-You've got it.
-All right.

38:35.546 --> 38:37.348
Kinda glowing there, kid.

38:43.721 --> 38:46.857
-Ah. Fine Mexican beer.
-

38:48.059 --> 38:49.694
Can I wear your hat?

38:52.063 --> 38:53.331
No.

38:54.231 --> 38:55.399
Why not?

38:55.499 --> 38:57.568
Because it's a cowboy hat.

38:57.668 --> 39:00.471
And you're not a cowboy.

39:00.538 --> 39:03.407
Anything a  gringo  cowboy
can do with horses,

39:03.507 --> 39:05.409
a  Mexicano  can do better.

39:08.179 --> 39:09.914
Well, you're
in bad shape, then,

39:10.014 --> 39:11.749
because you're half  gringo.

39:17.054 --> 39:19.757
-What do you think, kid?

39:21.692 --> 39:23.527
You think I'm a  gringo?

39:24.428 --> 39:25.429
Yeah.

39:27.264 --> 39:30.735
Do you think
I'm like my father?

39:31.535 --> 39:33.170
A coward?

39:34.004 --> 39:35.439
Who run away?

39:38.242 --> 39:40.177
-Well...
-You think

39:40.244 --> 39:42.246
I'm like my mom?

39:42.346 --> 39:43.714
Weak?

39:45.850 --> 39:48.352
I don't know.
I don't know your mom.

39:48.419 --> 39:49.954
-But your father--
-Then...

39:52.890 --> 39:54.792
who am I, Mike?

39:58.229 --> 39:59.964
Here, kid. Try the hat--

40:00.064 --> 40:02.099
I don't want to wear
your dumb, stupid hat.

40:11.409 --> 40:13.778
Mike!
-

40:24.722 --> 40:27.057
Help me, Mike!
Get off!

40:27.124 --> 40:28.626
What the hell
are you doing?

40:28.726 --> 40:30.161
You leave him alone.
-Get away.

40:30.261 --> 40:31.996
He's not your son.
He's not yours to take.

40:32.096 --> 40:34.498
His mother warned you,  gringo.
Don't be stubborn!

40:34.598 --> 40:36.300
-No.
-This is your last chance.

40:36.400 --> 40:39.103
Mike!
-The kid is not your concern.

40:39.170 --> 40:41.472
Good job, Macho.
- Hey, stupid bird!

40:41.572 --> 40:43.808
Good job, Macho.
-

40:48.846 --> 40:50.581
Okay.

40:59.023 --> 41:00.357
What's he saying?

41:01.592 --> 41:02.626
It's not good.

41:16.140 --> 41:17.641
Rafael. Rafael.

41:24.148 --> 41:26.217
Time for us to go.

41:26.317 --> 41:28.185
-

41:43.000 --> 41:46.537
You did all right, kid.
You did all right.

41:53.544 --> 41:54.912
You want
another tortilla?

41:55.012 --> 41:57.014
No, I don't.
I don't think so. No.

41:58.482 --> 42:00.417
-What's the matter?

42:00.518 --> 42:03.587
Yeah, no,
I don't feel too good.

42:07.558 --> 42:09.927
I don't know
why you're laughing.

42:10.027 --> 42:12.997
You Mexicans
always laugh at us  gringos

42:13.063 --> 42:15.699
because we get sick
on your dirty water.

42:15.766 --> 42:19.003
It's not the water
that's dirty. It's you.

42:19.069 --> 42:20.871
We drink and we're healthy.

42:20.938 --> 42:23.941
You drink it
and die in the toilet.

42:24.041 --> 42:26.544
-Ah, don't mention that.
-

42:27.511 --> 42:28.546
Speaking...

42:32.182 --> 42:35.719
Run! It's gonna come out.

42:37.721 --> 42:41.091
Wait. I'll give you something
to make you feel better.

42:42.192 --> 42:43.193
What?

42:53.737 --> 42:55.472
Here, try it.

42:55.573 --> 42:56.473
Cactus?

42:56.574 --> 42:57.775
Yeah, it's good. Try it.

42:58.642 --> 42:59.710
You try it.

43:01.579 --> 43:03.080
Okay. Watch.

43:05.249 --> 43:07.384
-See? I did not die.
-Okay.

43:12.056 --> 43:13.290
-

43:17.728 --> 43:18.662
Hey!

43:18.762 --> 43:20.230
-Go! Go, go, go!
- No!

43:21.565 --> 43:23.067
-The car!

43:23.133 --> 43:24.234
No!

43:27.237 --> 43:28.238
No!

43:38.315 --> 43:39.650
Shit!

43:46.991 --> 43:49.760
I can't even call the cops.

44:08.479 --> 44:11.048
So, what now?

44:11.148 --> 44:13.817
We gotta get ourselves
some transportation.

44:13.884 --> 44:15.152
And clothes.

44:15.219 --> 44:17.688
And you should dress
not like an American.

44:17.788 --> 44:21.492
So everybody doesn't see
gringo, gringo, gringo.

44:23.994 --> 44:25.229
I want some water.

44:30.801 --> 44:33.971
There's a store right here.
I think I'll go
check it out.

44:35.305 --> 44:36.306
Yeah.

44:54.692 --> 44:56.026
Look, Macho.

44:56.093 --> 44:58.162
A  gringo  goes in,
and a  Mexicano  comes out.

44:58.228 --> 45:00.030
Yeah, I bought you
some clothes.

45:00.097 --> 45:01.365
Thank you.

45:01.432 --> 45:02.433
Well,

45:03.534 --> 45:04.735
I guess we should be going.

45:04.835 --> 45:05.836
What's this?

45:05.903 --> 45:07.337
Transportation.

45:09.073 --> 45:11.608
Transportation?
Where'd you get it?

45:11.709 --> 45:12.710
I find it.

45:14.178 --> 45:15.679
Bullshit.

45:15.746 --> 45:18.449
It was sitting right here.
So nobody want it,
I guess.

45:18.549 --> 45:21.952
Yeah? Nobody was
sitting in it then, huh?

45:22.052 --> 45:23.554
We'll leave it
in the next town.

45:23.620 --> 45:25.789
-Yeah.
-I only lend it from somebody.

45:25.889 --> 45:27.925
In Mexico,
we're friendly people.

45:28.025 --> 45:29.593
You lend, I lend.

45:29.693 --> 45:31.795
-We lend,
everybody lends.
-Yeah, yeah.

45:31.895 --> 45:32.863
What?

45:32.930 --> 45:34.364
Just, uh...

45:34.431 --> 45:36.433
It's not your car

45:36.533 --> 45:38.202
and I'll be driving it.

45:48.278 --> 45:49.313
Macho.

46:16.473 --> 46:18.742
You're kind of
growing on me, kid.

46:22.412 --> 46:24.748
This looks like
an interesting town.

46:26.316 --> 46:28.452
Maybe we should check it out.

46:36.593 --> 46:37.661
Hola,  Mama.

46:49.373 --> 46:51.708
What do you say
we look around, huh?

46:55.279 --> 46:57.314
Bring in the rooster.

47:10.494 --> 47:11.728
Federales.

47:39.356 --> 47:40.591
I'll have coffee for me,

47:40.691 --> 47:43.026
and anything in the house
for him.

48:04.615 --> 48:05.682
Aqui.

48:07.351 --> 48:08.752
Thank you.

48:39.816 --> 48:41.251
Uh...

48:41.318 --> 48:42.786
She says that's strange.

48:42.886 --> 48:45.055
The  Federales
never come over here.

48:46.490 --> 48:47.557
Gracias.

48:48.926 --> 48:50.661
Thank you very much. Yeah.

48:50.761 --> 48:51.929
Si.  Uh...

49:06.677 --> 49:09.346
I'm gonna take
a little  siesta  here.

49:09.446 --> 49:12.516
Tired, eh?
Old man needs a nap?

49:12.616 --> 49:14.584
-You bet.
-

49:33.003 --> 49:34.004
Macho.

49:35.138 --> 49:36.873
The hell you doing here?

49:39.476 --> 49:42.646
Don't drink out of my cup
either, will you, pal?

49:47.985 --> 49:52.689
Dreamt I was in
a desert bar,
but now I'm in one.

49:55.158 --> 49:56.226
Jerk.

50:15.679 --> 50:18.815
She says you don't snore.
She likes that.

50:22.152 --> 50:23.920
did I miss anything here?

50:24.021 --> 50:27.257
Yeah. She asked why
the  Federales
were looking for us.

50:27.357 --> 50:31.194
I tell her you're my father,
and you broke out
of the  loco,

50:31.261 --> 50:32.896
the crazy hospital.

50:32.996 --> 50:35.599
And they're looking for you.

50:35.699 --> 50:37.768
And she bought into all that?

50:39.036 --> 50:40.937
She didn't believe me.

50:41.038 --> 50:43.440
So, then I told her

50:43.540 --> 50:46.043
you're here to bring me
to Texas with my father

50:46.109 --> 50:48.111
and my mother says no.

50:48.211 --> 50:50.347
So, you told her the truth.

50:51.381 --> 50:53.850
I thought
you didn't trust anyone.

50:54.885 --> 50:56.453
No.

50:56.553 --> 50:58.288
But you trust her?

51:01.558 --> 51:05.262
Yeah.
Yeah, for some reason,
I guess, yes.

51:06.863 --> 51:09.132
Oh, well,

51:09.232 --> 51:11.101
on that, I think we oughta...

51:11.935 --> 51:13.970
We oughta go.

51:14.071 --> 51:16.239
Will you, uh,
thank the  senora  for me?

51:17.307 --> 51:18.975
Senorita.

51:19.076 --> 51:22.045
She's not married.
She's a widow.

51:22.779 --> 51:24.748
Marta.

51:24.815 --> 51:26.416
Mi nombre,  name,

51:27.084 --> 51:28.218
Marta.

51:31.054 --> 51:32.255
I'm Mike.

51:33.156 --> 51:35.425
Si.  He say.

51:36.560 --> 51:37.561
Yeah.

51:39.396 --> 51:40.397
Okay.

52:20.203 --> 52:22.005
Not another roadblock.

52:37.287 --> 52:40.123
What's the Spanish word
for "irony"?

52:42.125 --> 52:45.295
Well, we'll have to go back
to that town we were in.

52:46.663 --> 52:49.833
Just wait till
this shitstorm's over with.

52:56.173 --> 52:58.642
Perfect place
to get out of the rain.

53:22.532 --> 53:23.533
Huh.

53:24.768 --> 53:26.269
It's a shrine, Mike.

53:32.108 --> 53:33.777
Of the  Virgen Maria.

53:50.894 --> 53:51.795
Okay.

53:51.895 --> 53:54.064
What are you doing?

53:54.130 --> 53:56.299
-Hmm?
-What are you doing?

53:56.399 --> 53:57.467
Oh, I'm, uh...

53:59.703 --> 54:01.471
I'm gonna go to sleep.

54:01.571 --> 54:03.473
What the hell
do you think this is?

54:03.573 --> 54:07.544
We cannot sleep in the shrine
of the  Virgen Maria.

54:07.611 --> 54:11.648
Maria's not gonna worry
about it. She's fine.

54:13.583 --> 54:15.318
She won't care.

54:26.463 --> 54:27.764
Night, kid.

54:32.902 --> 54:34.070
Mike?

54:34.137 --> 54:35.138
Yeah?

54:35.238 --> 54:37.073
Mike, do you believe in God?

54:41.511 --> 54:42.979
I don't know, kid.

54:44.247 --> 54:45.949
I guess so, yeah.

54:48.018 --> 54:51.254
You Catholic?

54:51.988 --> 54:53.323
No.

54:53.423 --> 54:55.425
I'm not Catholic, kid.

54:55.492 --> 54:57.794
That's too bad for you, Mike.

54:57.861 --> 55:00.196
Even if you believe in God
and you're not Catholic,

55:00.297 --> 55:03.833
they don't believe in you.

55:03.933 --> 55:07.470
What, is he playing favorites,
maybe, or something?

55:07.537 --> 55:09.205
Yeah.

55:09.306 --> 55:11.374
I don't believe this shit.

55:11.474 --> 55:14.511
"We're all God's children."

55:15.145 --> 55:16.179
Do you?

55:18.715 --> 55:22.152
Well, we're all
somebody's children, kid.

55:28.992 --> 55:31.027
Do you have any children?

55:32.662 --> 55:33.663
No.

55:36.666 --> 55:38.034
Oh, I did.

55:39.035 --> 55:40.036
Did?

55:40.970 --> 55:42.539
Yeah.

55:42.639 --> 55:44.240
Matthew, boy.

55:46.810 --> 55:49.145
My boy...

55:49.212 --> 55:51.848
and my wife were killed
in an auto accident

55:51.915 --> 55:53.516
some years back.

55:55.318 --> 55:56.319
Sorry.

55:59.756 --> 56:00.924
Anyway...

56:02.759 --> 56:06.096
I wasn't much good after that.

56:06.196 --> 56:08.431
I kind of went
on a rampage.

56:08.531 --> 56:10.266
Too much drinking.

56:11.167 --> 56:12.602
Being crazy.

56:16.373 --> 56:17.941
But your dad,

56:19.709 --> 56:21.511
he saved my ass.

56:23.546 --> 56:25.248
He gave me work.

56:27.684 --> 56:28.752
He...

56:30.186 --> 56:32.622
gave me my life back.

56:32.722 --> 56:34.457
I owe him a lot.

56:36.960 --> 56:39.629
And you're the payback, kid.

56:40.797 --> 56:42.298
You're the payback.

56:43.633 --> 56:45.602
I'm paying him back.

57:05.255 --> 57:06.256
Hey!

57:17.434 --> 57:19.602
Look at this. Fantastic, huh?

57:23.773 --> 57:25.742
How'd you know
we were here?

57:30.947 --> 57:34.851
She came to light a candle,
and she saw our car.

57:35.952 --> 57:36.986
Yeah.

57:37.921 --> 57:39.022
Well, thanks.

57:39.122 --> 57:40.423
Gracias.

57:42.492 --> 57:43.526
Muy bien.

58:07.817 --> 58:09.352
Oh, damn!

58:19.529 --> 58:20.897
What's the matter?

58:20.997 --> 58:22.465
Look, the car.

58:29.572 --> 58:31.341
Whoa, Jesus.

58:33.009 --> 58:34.511
Well,

58:34.577 --> 58:36.880
we better get used
to this town, kid.

58:36.980 --> 58:38.815
We're gonna be here
a while.

58:39.849 --> 58:41.684
It's a piece of shit.

59:01.604 --> 59:03.106
Everything all right?

59:03.206 --> 59:04.207
Hey.

59:05.708 --> 59:07.110
You speak English,  amigo?

59:07.210 --> 59:08.745
Yeah.

59:08.845 --> 59:12.782
These horse are for sale.
You want to buy?

59:12.882 --> 59:16.786
I noticed one of those guys
has got an injury

59:16.886 --> 59:18.888
on the left haunch there.

59:18.955 --> 59:20.590
He's a little rough to me.

59:20.690 --> 59:22.058
Yeah, in fact,
all your horses

59:22.125 --> 59:24.227
are a little
on the rough side.

59:24.294 --> 59:26.763
They get hurt
being rounded up.

59:26.863 --> 59:28.464
Wild horses, huh?

59:28.565 --> 59:31.467
Si,  we catch,
but not break them.

59:31.568 --> 59:33.303
They are very wild.

59:33.403 --> 59:35.071
Not many can ride.

59:35.138 --> 59:36.472
Yeah.

59:36.573 --> 59:39.576
Pretty hard to sell a horse
that you can't ride.

59:47.750 --> 59:50.153
Maybe we can do
something about that.

59:50.253 --> 59:52.221
-We? Who's we?
-Yeah.

59:52.288 --> 59:53.456
You and me.

59:54.591 --> 59:57.126
I don't even know how to ride.

59:57.226 --> 59:58.428
But I can do anything.

59:58.494 --> 59:59.762
Of course you can.

59:59.829 --> 1:00:01.798
Wouldn't want to
get up there in Texas

1:00:01.898 --> 1:00:04.934
and have people find out
you don't know how to ride.

1:00:34.197 --> 1:00:35.198
Whoa.

1:00:37.133 --> 1:00:38.334
Macho.

1:00:39.669 --> 1:00:41.037
Okay.

1:00:41.137 --> 1:00:43.006
Pick up the flow, will ya?

1:00:44.374 --> 1:00:46.709
Keep your weight
on the balls
of your feet.

1:00:50.346 --> 1:00:53.116
More like it.
Do less with your hands.

1:00:55.385 --> 1:00:56.853
Pick it up more.

1:00:58.388 --> 1:00:59.522
Attaboy.

1:01:01.057 --> 1:01:02.625
Not bad at all.

1:01:04.360 --> 1:01:06.896
Pick it up. Pick it up. More.

1:01:06.996 --> 1:01:08.297
There you go.

1:01:08.364 --> 1:01:10.900
Don't lay back.
Stay upright.

1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:13.336
There, that's good.
That's good.

1:01:13.403 --> 1:01:15.405
Heels down. That's good.

1:01:15.505 --> 1:01:16.739
That's a good
little figure eight.

1:01:16.839 --> 1:01:18.174
Come back this way.

1:01:23.546 --> 1:01:25.415
All right, son.
You're doing good.

1:01:25.515 --> 1:01:27.417
You're doing great.

1:01:27.517 --> 1:01:30.586
May not be a disgrace
in Texas after all.

1:01:56.079 --> 1:01:58.181
Here's a gift, ladies.

1:02:01.184 --> 1:02:02.418
Cafe?

1:02:04.053 --> 1:02:05.855
Sure. All right.

1:02:06.889 --> 1:02:09.258
-

1:02:09.358 --> 1:02:10.393
Okay.

1:02:24.207 --> 1:02:26.209
Thank you.

1:02:26.275 --> 1:02:31.380
You know,
we just brought you
that meat as a gift.

1:02:35.752 --> 1:02:37.987
Yeah, I just came here
to bring stuff.

1:02:38.087 --> 1:02:42.125
I didn't come here
to freeload a meal.

1:02:42.225 --> 1:02:43.326
Uh...

1:02:53.136 --> 1:02:57.106
Um, she says
she'll do as she pleases.

1:02:57.173 --> 1:02:58.775
Oh, all right.

1:03:00.109 --> 1:03:01.144
Okay.

1:03:14.524 --> 1:03:16.092
These your girls?

1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:31.841
Mm-mm.

1:03:31.941 --> 1:03:33.342
Granddaughters.

1:03:33.442 --> 1:03:36.779
Her daughter got sick
and died.

1:03:36.846 --> 1:03:38.447
Also her son-in-law.

1:03:39.816 --> 1:03:42.218
Her husband died too.

1:03:42.318 --> 1:03:44.554
Same illness. Two years ago.

1:03:44.654 --> 1:03:46.689
Now widow, like you.

1:03:48.057 --> 1:03:49.325
Sorry.

1:04:17.687 --> 1:04:19.222
She's deaf?

1:04:20.323 --> 1:04:21.490
Seems so.

1:04:23.392 --> 1:04:25.161
How do you know sign language?

1:04:26.696 --> 1:04:29.498
Just something you pick up
along the way.

1:04:44.513 --> 1:04:45.781
What did you say?

1:04:45.882 --> 1:04:47.917
Wouldn't you like to know?

1:06:06.295 --> 1:06:09.432
So, what's that all about?

1:06:10.333 --> 1:06:11.801
The deputy.

1:06:11.867 --> 1:06:13.302
What about the deputy?

1:06:13.369 --> 1:06:16.439
Uh, first,
he said he's a sheriff

1:06:16.505 --> 1:06:19.275
and it's his job to know
what's going on.

1:06:19.342 --> 1:06:22.278
But she said
he's not the sheriff.
He's a deputy.

1:06:22.345 --> 1:06:24.947
And that's only
because his uncle
made him deputy.

1:06:25.014 --> 1:06:27.350
And they don't even have
a police station.

1:06:27.450 --> 1:06:29.051
And if he didn't mind
his business,

1:06:29.151 --> 1:06:31.120
she said he never eat
at the  cantina  again.

1:06:38.995 --> 1:06:40.863
Uh, what's next?

1:06:54.043 --> 1:06:55.578
Looking good, kid.

1:06:58.247 --> 1:07:01.250
Look where you're going,
and go where you're looking.

1:07:03.019 --> 1:07:04.520
Good.

1:07:04.587 --> 1:07:06.188
Put your heels down.

1:07:06.255 --> 1:07:07.390
Okay.

1:07:07.490 --> 1:07:08.991
Heels down.

1:07:09.058 --> 1:07:11.260
Yeah, don't look like
a sack of potatoes there.

1:07:14.530 --> 1:07:17.266
Your dad's gonna be
a happy man
seeing you that way.

1:07:17.366 --> 1:07:18.567
-We'll see you in a bit.
- Yeah.

1:07:18.667 --> 1:07:21.504
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

1:07:26.008 --> 1:07:28.344
Uh, this is  Senora  Reyes.

1:07:28.411 --> 1:07:29.945
Her goat
was attacked by dogs,

1:07:30.046 --> 1:07:32.615
so I tell her
you're good with animals.

1:07:32.715 --> 1:07:34.517
Well, why don't you put him
over here.

1:07:34.583 --> 1:07:37.253
Put him on this table,
we'll take a look.

1:07:42.892 --> 1:07:44.727
Put him right up there.

1:07:45.594 --> 1:07:47.296
Let me see.

1:07:47.396 --> 1:07:49.565
Let's see. Oh, yeah.

1:07:49.632 --> 1:07:52.435
Yeah,
somebody chewed on him
pretty good.

1:07:52.535 --> 1:07:54.303
Not so good. Yeah.

1:07:56.439 --> 1:07:57.473
Yeah.

1:08:07.483 --> 1:08:10.319
Okay, I think
we can fix her up in a bit.

1:08:10.419 --> 1:08:11.620
And it's gonna be okay.

1:08:12.822 --> 1:08:14.156
All righty.

1:08:14.256 --> 1:08:15.491
Mike,
it should've taken three,

1:08:15.591 --> 1:08:16.959
maybe four days tops.

1:08:17.059 --> 1:08:19.161
But two goddamn weeks?
What are you doing?

1:08:19.261 --> 1:08:21.664
I told you
it was gonna
take a little while.

1:08:21.764 --> 1:08:23.332
I heard that already.

1:08:23.432 --> 1:08:25.768
Just keep telling him
what he wants to hear.

1:08:25.835 --> 1:08:27.303
-Who?
-  "Who?"

1:08:27.403 --> 1:08:30.072
The kid. Rafael.

1:08:30.973 --> 1:08:32.174
Just keep him happy,

1:08:32.274 --> 1:08:33.509
and whatever you do,

1:08:33.609 --> 1:08:35.177
do not let his mother
get a hold of him.

1:08:35.277 --> 1:08:37.613
Or her lawyers
will never respond.

1:08:37.680 --> 1:08:39.014
Respond to what?

1:08:39.115 --> 1:08:40.783
It's a business thing.

1:08:40.850 --> 1:08:42.351
A few years ago,
down there in Mexico,

1:08:42.451 --> 1:08:44.620
I invested in some property
in her name

1:08:44.687 --> 1:08:46.856
to avoid their goddamn taxes,

1:08:46.956 --> 1:08:49.625
and now those investments
have matured.

1:08:49.692 --> 1:08:51.861
So I want the return
on my investment.

1:08:51.961 --> 1:08:53.362
Just like the kid.

1:08:53.462 --> 1:08:55.431
Well, yeah, okay.
So, you get it.

1:08:55.498 --> 1:08:56.632
Mm-hmm.

1:08:56.699 --> 1:08:58.868
I get it.
You played me, you bastard.

1:08:58.968 --> 1:09:00.202
I didn't play you.

1:09:00.302 --> 1:09:02.538
What are you,
eight years old, Mike?

1:09:03.139 --> 1:09:04.173
Jesus!

1:09:04.273 --> 1:09:06.609
If I have something
she wants,

1:09:06.675 --> 1:09:08.777
maybe she'll negotiate.

1:09:08.844 --> 1:09:11.180
Christ, I'm a reasonable man.

1:09:11.280 --> 1:09:13.549
I'm just asking for my half.

1:09:13.649 --> 1:09:16.385
This kid would be better off
without either one of you.

1:09:16.485 --> 1:09:17.820
Well, you know what?

1:09:17.887 --> 1:09:19.221
It doesn't make a shit
what you think, Mike.

1:09:19.321 --> 1:09:21.056
I'm his father

1:09:21.157 --> 1:09:23.959
and I actually
want him back.

1:09:24.026 --> 1:09:27.796
This isn't all about
the money, okay?

1:09:27.863 --> 1:09:29.465
The kid's my son.

1:09:30.499 --> 1:09:31.867
So, please...

1:09:33.068 --> 1:09:35.738
Please, can you stick
to the plan?

1:09:35.838 --> 1:09:37.706
Just meet me at the border
with him.

1:09:39.408 --> 1:09:40.409
Yeah.

1:09:55.724 --> 1:09:56.892
Was that my father?

1:09:56.992 --> 1:09:58.260
Yeah, it was, kid.

1:09:58.360 --> 1:09:59.995
Did he say anything
about me?

1:10:00.062 --> 1:10:01.597
Ask how I am?

1:10:01.697 --> 1:10:05.000
Well, he did, yeah. He...
He wants the best for ya.

1:10:05.067 --> 1:10:07.269
-He does?
- Yeah.

1:10:07.369 --> 1:10:09.838
He still wants me?
He still wants me to come?

1:10:09.905 --> 1:10:12.241
'Course he does, kid.
Why wouldn't he?

1:10:17.346 --> 1:10:19.615
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
Give me that.

1:10:20.716 --> 1:10:23.118
Okay, come on, there.

1:10:23.219 --> 1:10:24.520
Right through there.

1:10:24.587 --> 1:10:27.356
Stick your head in there,
and put it on up here.

1:10:28.557 --> 1:10:30.726
Put this here. Okay.

1:10:31.894 --> 1:10:33.028
We got him.

1:10:33.095 --> 1:10:35.698
Now, that was the easy part.

1:10:35.764 --> 1:10:38.033
-That was the easy part?
- Yeah.

1:10:38.100 --> 1:10:41.136
Next, they don't like it
when you cinch the girth.

1:10:42.137 --> 1:10:43.572
It's just like this.

1:10:43.639 --> 1:10:45.608
You just have to pull,
cinch it up.

1:10:45.708 --> 1:10:46.809
You can do it.

1:10:46.909 --> 1:10:48.477
-You wanna try it?
- Okay.

1:10:48.577 --> 1:10:51.647
Just cinch it up,
and put up half of...
An eighth of it.

1:10:53.048 --> 1:10:55.651
- Whoa! Whoa.

1:10:57.419 --> 1:10:58.654
Whoa.

1:10:58.754 --> 1:11:00.422
Whoa! He's so wild.

1:11:00.489 --> 1:11:03.058
Okay, yeah.
Take it easy.

1:11:03.125 --> 1:11:04.893
Hey, hey. Hey.

1:11:13.269 --> 1:11:14.837
How did you do that?

1:11:15.638 --> 1:11:17.573
We did it, partner.

1:11:17.640 --> 1:11:18.841
We did it.

1:11:39.194 --> 1:11:40.296
Buenos dias.

1:11:40.362 --> 1:11:41.297
Buenos dias.

1:11:41.363 --> 1:11:42.531
Sleep well?

1:11:42.631 --> 1:11:44.700
I did, yeah. I did.

1:11:44.800 --> 1:11:45.801
Thank you.

1:11:55.110 --> 1:11:59.381
Uh, Marta says
we can stay in the  casita
behind her house

1:11:59.481 --> 1:12:00.949
while we are here.

1:12:01.483 --> 1:12:02.885
No.

1:12:02.985 --> 1:12:04.720
We can't do that.
Can't do that.

1:12:04.820 --> 1:12:07.189
We've already
imposed on her enough.

1:12:07.289 --> 1:12:08.290
Well...

1:12:25.307 --> 1:12:26.408
Uh...

1:12:26.508 --> 1:12:27.576
She said it's her choice.

1:12:27.676 --> 1:12:29.011
-And she already...
-Right.

1:12:29.078 --> 1:12:30.312
...cleaned it out for us.

1:12:30.379 --> 1:12:32.014
Plus, she says
we can't keep sleeping

1:12:32.081 --> 1:12:33.916
in the shrine
of the  Virgen Maria.

1:12:34.016 --> 1:12:36.418
It's not a hotel.

1:12:36.518 --> 1:12:39.888
I know.
I'm fighting a losing battle.

1:12:41.657 --> 1:12:42.925
Okay.

1:12:43.025 --> 1:12:44.593
It's good or it's no?

1:12:45.494 --> 1:12:46.829
It's no.

1:12:48.030 --> 1:12:49.932
But what do we do
when we leave?

1:12:50.032 --> 1:12:53.402
We get ourselves another car,
that's what we do.

1:13:31.907 --> 1:13:33.208
Cook?

1:13:33.275 --> 1:13:34.943
Yeah. Well, you're always
cooking all the time.

1:13:35.043 --> 1:13:36.578
I thought
I would do it for you.

1:13:36.645 --> 1:13:39.214
-And cowboys always cook.

1:13:39.281 --> 1:13:40.983
It's kind of our deal.

1:13:45.721 --> 1:13:46.889
Okay.

1:13:48.290 --> 1:13:49.324
You want?

1:13:49.425 --> 1:13:50.826
-Um...

1:13:50.926 --> 1:13:51.927
Yeah.

1:14:09.011 --> 1:14:10.012
Amen.

1:14:15.250 --> 1:14:16.418
Okay.

1:14:20.456 --> 1:14:21.356
Um...

1:14:21.457 --> 1:14:23.792
I think she likes you.

1:14:25.194 --> 1:14:28.630
Just keep
your big mouth shut.

1:14:28.697 --> 1:14:32.100
-And I think you like her.

1:14:49.885 --> 1:14:51.787
-Gracias.
-Gracias.

1:14:57.860 --> 1:14:59.561
More money to come.

1:14:59.661 --> 1:15:01.163
More mustangs to break.

1:15:01.230 --> 1:15:02.898
Yeah, you bet.

1:15:04.199 --> 1:15:06.235
The whole neighborhood's
coming down here.

1:15:06.335 --> 1:15:08.637
They must think
I'm Dr. Dolittle
or something.

1:15:08.704 --> 1:15:10.305
Uh...
- The hell is this?

1:15:10.372 --> 1:15:12.708
These girls
need some help
with the animals.

1:15:16.178 --> 1:15:18.580
Yeah, I don't know
what to tell you.

1:15:18.680 --> 1:15:21.083
I don't know
what to tell you
about this gal.

1:15:21.183 --> 1:15:22.584
Yeah, what do you say?

1:15:22.684 --> 1:15:24.853
You just need to lose
a little weight, that's all.

1:15:29.391 --> 1:15:34.263
You take it easy,
just a little more water.

1:15:34.363 --> 1:15:37.332
Little more water
and less food.

1:15:48.410 --> 1:15:50.445
He wants
to know who are you,

1:15:50.546 --> 1:15:51.613
what's your business?

1:15:54.383 --> 1:15:58.086
Do you have a, uh,  licencia?

1:15:58.186 --> 1:15:59.688
Well, these people want me

1:15:59.755 --> 1:16:02.291
to take care
of some of their animals.

1:16:02.391 --> 1:16:05.027
People seem to think
I have a knack with that.

1:16:14.736 --> 1:16:16.238
He said, help the dog,

1:16:16.305 --> 1:16:17.739
or his wife
will be very angry.

1:16:17.806 --> 1:16:18.941
Yeah?

1:16:19.041 --> 1:16:19.975
He said it's not good
when she's angry.

1:16:20.075 --> 1:16:21.143
She'll be angry?

1:16:21.243 --> 1:16:23.145
-Not for you either.
- Hmm.

1:16:24.079 --> 1:16:26.648
Okay. All right.

1:16:26.748 --> 1:16:27.749
Yeah.

1:16:28.951 --> 1:16:30.485
Looks pretty good.

1:16:34.256 --> 1:16:37.893
I don't know
how to cure "old."

1:16:37.960 --> 1:16:41.396
I don't know.
But no way
am I telling her that.

1:16:41.463 --> 1:16:43.632
Hmm. Well...

1:16:43.732 --> 1:16:46.134
I think the dog
just needs a lot of rest.

1:16:46.234 --> 1:16:49.271
Maybe he should sleep
with you tonight.

1:16:49.338 --> 1:16:51.173
-On the end of the bed.
-

1:16:51.273 --> 1:16:52.574
How's that?

1:16:52.641 --> 1:16:54.009
Gracias.

1:16:54.109 --> 1:16:55.143
Yeah.

1:16:56.078 --> 1:16:57.846
We'll do the best we can.

1:16:57.946 --> 1:16:59.014
Gracias.

1:17:32.981 --> 1:17:34.049
I got you.

1:17:34.149 --> 1:17:35.050
Okay.

1:17:40.222 --> 1:17:42.024
Just give it a smash.

1:17:44.893 --> 1:17:45.894
Okay.

1:17:47.229 --> 1:17:48.563
I'm catching on to this stuff.

1:18:09.184 --> 1:18:11.153
This right here. Thanks.

1:18:11.219 --> 1:18:12.220
Yep.

1:18:14.856 --> 1:18:16.391
-Oh.

1:18:16.491 --> 1:18:18.060
There, I think we got it.

1:18:19.094 --> 1:18:20.228
Think we got it.

1:18:31.707 --> 1:18:33.075
Italian lager.

1:20:11.640 --> 1:20:15.110
If my father
didn't want me
to come to Texas,

1:20:15.177 --> 1:20:16.812
I would stay here.

1:20:18.647 --> 1:20:20.182
Yeah.

1:20:20.282 --> 1:20:22.951
You could've stayed too.
It's good.

1:20:24.186 --> 1:20:26.054
Mm-hmm.

1:20:26.154 --> 1:20:29.191
The best place I've stayed
in my life.

1:20:32.027 --> 1:20:34.996
Maybe even better than Texas.

1:20:37.132 --> 1:20:38.166
Hmm.

1:20:39.634 --> 1:20:41.069
Could be, kid.

1:20:43.338 --> 1:20:47.309
But I want to be
with my father.

1:20:47.375 --> 1:20:49.878
Have a new life in America.

1:20:51.546 --> 1:20:55.250
But what if it's no good?

1:20:55.350 --> 1:20:58.320
What if my father
change his mind
when he meets me?

1:20:59.721 --> 1:21:01.489
Doesn't want me?

1:21:03.525 --> 1:21:05.026
He wants you, kid.

1:21:08.396 --> 1:21:09.664
He wants you.

1:21:44.933 --> 1:21:46.701
Rafo!
The hell you doing?

1:21:46.768 --> 1:21:47.736
Nothing.

1:21:47.802 --> 1:21:49.471
We gotta get out of here.
Come on.

1:21:49.571 --> 1:21:50.972
What?

1:21:51.072 --> 1:21:53.575
Aurelio. I saw him in town,
he's talking to the cops.

1:21:53.642 --> 1:21:55.777
We gotta get on the road.

1:21:55.877 --> 1:21:56.978
Uh...

1:21:57.078 --> 1:22:00.615
But what about the girls?
What about Marta?

1:22:00.715 --> 1:22:02.384
Us being around here
is the worst thing

1:22:02.450 --> 1:22:03.752
that could happen
to the girls.

1:22:03.818 --> 1:22:06.254
We gotta get moving.
Come on.

1:22:06.321 --> 1:22:07.822
Get your ass in gear.

1:22:21.903 --> 1:22:23.605
Hola,  Mike.

1:22:23.672 --> 1:22:25.840
Marta, we...
We have to go.

1:22:25.941 --> 1:22:27.676
We've got a job
we've gotta finish,

1:22:27.776 --> 1:22:29.511
-and just...
-

1:22:31.947 --> 1:22:34.783
Well,
you've been so great
to us, you know,

1:22:34.849 --> 1:22:36.618
-it's just tough to leave.
-

1:22:39.354 --> 1:22:40.989
That, and the kids
and everything,

1:22:41.089 --> 1:22:42.123
it's just...

1:22:44.926 --> 1:22:46.361
Anyway...

1:22:47.295 --> 1:22:48.630
we've gotta go.

1:22:57.872 --> 1:22:59.541
Thanks for everything.

1:23:25.667 --> 1:23:27.335
Let's try this thing.

1:23:39.147 --> 1:23:41.483
Okay. You go here.

1:23:46.021 --> 1:23:47.522
Okay, go ahead.

1:23:57.932 --> 1:24:01.169
What do I say
when they ask for my papers
at the border?

1:24:01.236 --> 1:24:03.405
What do I tell them?

1:24:03.505 --> 1:24:04.773
You don't have
to tell 'em anything.

1:24:04.873 --> 1:24:06.708
-Your dad will be there.
-

1:24:06.775 --> 1:24:08.543
He'll take care of it all.

1:24:09.711 --> 1:24:10.712
Okay.

1:24:39.040 --> 1:24:42.243
Yeah.
We gotta lose these guys.

1:24:48.116 --> 1:24:50.085
When I get
to the next set of curves,

1:24:50.151 --> 1:24:52.754
just hang on,
we'll get rid of 'em.

1:25:21.983 --> 1:25:23.585
We lost them.

1:25:23.651 --> 1:25:26.588
Yeah, for the time being,
anyway.

1:25:26.654 --> 1:25:28.022
Look, kid,

1:25:28.123 --> 1:25:29.691
there's something
I didn't tell you
the other day

1:25:29.791 --> 1:25:31.092
when we talked.

1:25:31.159 --> 1:25:32.927
It's about your dad.

1:25:33.962 --> 1:25:35.463
Yeah, I mean,

1:25:35.530 --> 1:25:37.265
he wants you
to come be with him
and everything,

1:25:37.332 --> 1:25:38.600
but there's another reason.

1:25:38.666 --> 1:25:40.135
And that's 'cause
your mother and he

1:25:40.201 --> 1:25:41.970
have some investments
together.

1:25:42.036 --> 1:25:45.140
And he thinks
if you're with him
up in Texas,

1:25:45.206 --> 1:25:48.810
that she'll give him half
of all the investments.

1:25:49.477 --> 1:25:51.045
So, you lied?

1:25:51.846 --> 1:25:53.047
No, I didn't lie.

1:25:53.148 --> 1:25:55.884
I just didn't know
at the time, that's all.

1:25:55.984 --> 1:25:57.719
Bullshit.

1:25:57.819 --> 1:26:02.357
Hundreds of horses,
cattle, a ranch...

1:26:03.024 --> 1:26:04.392
It's a rodeo.

1:26:04.492 --> 1:26:06.728
Yeah, that's all true, kid.

1:26:06.828 --> 1:26:08.997
That's all true.
He has all that.

1:26:10.498 --> 1:26:12.700
You're gonna love it there.

1:26:12.800 --> 1:26:14.702
How could he...

1:26:15.837 --> 1:26:17.071
How could you?

1:26:17.172 --> 1:26:18.072
No...

1:26:18.173 --> 1:26:20.308
I should have never trust you.

1:26:21.176 --> 1:26:22.744
Never trust anyone.

1:26:22.844 --> 1:26:25.180
I didn't know at the time,
that's all.

1:26:26.381 --> 1:26:28.249
You're a liar.

1:26:28.349 --> 1:26:31.085
And I hate you.
I hate you.

1:26:31.186 --> 1:26:32.720
And I hope you die in jail.

1:26:32.820 --> 1:26:35.523
Jesus Christ, kid.

1:27:11.059 --> 1:27:12.393
Bunch of rubes.

1:27:18.766 --> 1:27:21.135
What the hell
is he looking for, anyway?

1:27:21.736 --> 1:27:22.737
Drugs.

1:27:26.140 --> 1:27:27.308
Drugs?

1:27:27.408 --> 1:27:29.410
You gotta be out
of your minds.

1:27:33.648 --> 1:27:36.384
Jerk offs. Asshole.

1:27:36.451 --> 1:27:38.253
We don't have any drugs.

1:27:39.254 --> 1:27:40.822
Jesus Christ.

1:27:53.968 --> 1:27:56.104
Mickey Mouse prick.

1:27:57.739 --> 1:28:00.441
Yeah.
Nothing.

1:28:00.508 --> 1:28:02.644
-Yeah.
-When did you leave Veracruz?

1:28:02.744 --> 1:28:05.480
I've never been
to Veracruz ever.

1:28:08.583 --> 1:28:10.351
He said,
"Where are the drugs?"

1:28:10.451 --> 1:28:12.687
But no, we don't have drugs.

1:28:12.787 --> 1:28:14.589
We don't have any drugs.

1:28:15.657 --> 1:28:16.824
You guys
are wasting your time.

1:28:16.924 --> 1:28:18.860
You got nothing else to do.

1:28:18.960 --> 1:28:20.295
Loser cops.

1:28:20.361 --> 1:28:23.531
You wanna help us
put this stuff
back in the car?

1:28:23.631 --> 1:28:26.701
Caballeros,
I guess we make a mistake.

1:28:26.801 --> 1:28:27.802
Yeah.

1:28:28.336 --> 1:28:29.304
Good.

1:28:29.370 --> 1:28:31.873
Vamonos.  You're free to go.

1:28:31.973 --> 1:28:33.675
Couldn't be sooner.

1:28:33.775 --> 1:28:35.209
Jesus Christ.

1:28:36.811 --> 1:28:38.212
One thing
I don't understand.

1:28:38.313 --> 1:28:39.480
Those bastards.

1:28:39.547 --> 1:28:41.649
If you have no drugs,
why you run?

1:28:41.716 --> 1:28:43.451
-We're not running, asshole.
-

1:28:56.364 --> 1:28:57.365
Uh...

1:29:04.072 --> 1:29:07.141
Yeah,
his dad's  enfermo  in Texas,

1:29:07.208 --> 1:29:08.576
and we gotta get up there
right away.

1:29:23.157 --> 1:29:24.225
Gracias.

1:29:24.325 --> 1:29:25.360
Gentlemen.

1:29:27.161 --> 1:29:30.031
Jesus Christ.
Asshole.

1:29:33.735 --> 1:29:34.769
Losers.

1:29:35.503 --> 1:29:36.738
Stupid bastards.

1:29:36.838 --> 1:29:39.040
If they had a brain,
they'd be dangerous.

1:29:39.107 --> 1:29:41.109
Thanks a lot, you pricks.

1:29:41.209 --> 1:29:43.378
Okay, let's get this stuff
in the car.

1:29:43.444 --> 1:29:46.080
You and I, we gotta talk.

1:29:47.582 --> 1:29:49.450
I don't want to talk to you.

1:29:49.550 --> 1:29:51.052
Yeah, well,
you're gonna talk to me
whether you like it or not.

1:29:51.119 --> 1:29:52.854
I thought
you were my friend.

1:29:52.920 --> 1:29:55.757
For the first time,
I thought I had a friend.

1:29:57.692 --> 1:29:58.960
You're nothing to me.

1:29:59.060 --> 1:30:01.262
You just get shit
in the car,

1:30:01.362 --> 1:30:02.597
and shut up.

1:30:06.968 --> 1:30:08.269
I'm gonna get the seat

1:30:08.369 --> 1:30:09.604
if you can help me
with it a little bit.

1:30:14.142 --> 1:30:16.811
Hey, quick. Pull this.

1:30:16.911 --> 1:30:19.147
Your father lied
to both of us.

1:30:20.748 --> 1:30:23.584
And... So, quit bitching, huh?

1:30:23.651 --> 1:30:25.753
You're both goddamn liars.

1:30:35.630 --> 1:30:36.664
Okay.

1:30:41.102 --> 1:30:42.270
Okay.

1:30:45.440 --> 1:30:48.009
Freedom's just on the other
side of this hill, kid.

1:30:50.278 --> 1:30:51.279
Let's go.

1:30:54.081 --> 1:30:55.116
Let's go.

1:31:12.667 --> 1:31:14.368
You used to be tough.

1:31:15.303 --> 1:31:17.672
Now you're weak.

1:31:19.106 --> 1:31:23.110
You used to ride bulls,
ride horses.

1:31:23.978 --> 1:31:25.513
You were something.

1:31:26.981 --> 1:31:28.049
I was something.

1:31:28.149 --> 1:31:31.018
You used to be strong.

1:31:31.819 --> 1:31:33.020
Macho.

1:31:35.857 --> 1:31:37.325
Now you're nothing.

1:31:38.125 --> 1:31:39.160
Yeah.

1:31:40.328 --> 1:31:43.998
Well, I used to be
a lot of things,

1:31:44.065 --> 1:31:46.033
but I'm not now.

1:31:46.133 --> 1:31:48.636
And I'll tell you something.

1:31:48.703 --> 1:31:51.372
This macho thing
is overrated.

1:31:51.472 --> 1:31:53.474
Works perfect for him,

1:31:54.342 --> 1:31:56.544
but it's overrated.

1:31:56.644 --> 1:31:59.814
Just people
trying to be macho

1:31:59.881 --> 1:32:02.483
to show that
they've got grit.

1:32:02.550 --> 1:32:05.386
That's about
all they end up with.

1:32:05.486 --> 1:32:08.189
And you sit there
and let a bull
step all over you,

1:32:08.256 --> 1:32:11.592
and you let a horse throw you
50 feet in the air.

1:32:12.426 --> 1:32:13.761
What an idiot.

1:32:13.861 --> 1:32:16.998
Only an idiot would be
in a profession like that.

1:32:18.199 --> 1:32:19.400
It's just...

1:32:20.501 --> 1:32:21.903
It's like anything else
in life.

1:32:22.003 --> 1:32:24.105
You think
you got all the answers,

1:32:24.205 --> 1:32:25.540
then you realize
as you get old,

1:32:25.606 --> 1:32:27.508
that you don't have
any of 'em.

1:32:29.544 --> 1:32:32.847
By the time
you figure it out,
it's too late.

1:32:39.720 --> 1:32:42.723
Your dad's a good man.

1:32:42.790 --> 1:32:45.526
We all have to make choices
in life, kid.

1:32:46.527 --> 1:32:48.796
You have to make yours.

1:32:48.896 --> 1:32:50.531
Where do you want to go?

1:32:54.035 --> 1:32:55.903
I made my choice, Mike.

1:32:57.271 --> 1:32:59.040
-I wanna go.
-

1:33:12.987 --> 1:33:14.055
Oh, shit.

1:33:15.957 --> 1:33:18.225
Let's get you out of here.

1:33:19.427 --> 1:33:20.561
Hey, Mike.

1:33:21.796 --> 1:33:23.164
Remember me?

1:33:24.432 --> 1:33:25.633
Rafo,

1:33:25.733 --> 1:33:26.834
I don't want
to hurt your grandpa,

1:33:26.934 --> 1:33:29.303
so come with me, okay?

1:33:30.104 --> 1:33:31.105
Mike.

1:33:34.442 --> 1:33:36.477
-

1:33:42.917 --> 1:33:43.951
Mike.

1:33:46.120 --> 1:33:47.855
Stay there, asshole.

1:33:48.589 --> 1:33:49.857
Okay.

1:34:16.884 --> 1:34:20.154
So, what do you think
about Macho now?

1:34:20.221 --> 1:34:21.822
I think a lot about him.

1:34:21.889 --> 1:34:25.960
I think he handled everything
just beautifully back there.

1:34:26.027 --> 1:34:27.328
Yeah, he's amazing.

1:34:27.395 --> 1:34:28.896
The real deal.

1:34:28.996 --> 1:34:29.997
Yeah.

1:35:03.664 --> 1:35:04.699
Huh.

1:35:07.268 --> 1:35:09.003
Thank you, Mike.

1:35:10.705 --> 1:35:13.107
You're welcome, kid.

1:35:13.207 --> 1:35:15.576
You take care
of that chicken, huh?

1:35:17.712 --> 1:35:19.246
He's not a chicken.

1:35:20.281 --> 1:35:21.682
He's Macho.

1:35:27.888 --> 1:35:28.923
He's yours now.

1:35:29.623 --> 1:35:30.891
You're sure?

1:35:32.226 --> 1:35:33.794
It could be...

1:35:35.563 --> 1:35:38.632
Saturday night barbecue,
you never know.

1:35:43.904 --> 1:35:44.972
I'll take care of him.

1:35:47.141 --> 1:35:48.909
And you take care, kid.

1:35:50.244 --> 1:35:53.481
You take care.
You know where we are.

1:35:53.581 --> 1:35:55.149
If you need us.

1:35:56.317 --> 1:35:57.618
Thank you.

1:36:01.255 --> 1:36:02.490
All right, boy.

1:36:13.167 --> 1:36:15.002
Yeah.

1:36:15.102 --> 1:36:17.304
I hear you, loud and clear.

1:36:27.648 --> 1:36:28.649
Huh.

1:36:35.956 --> 1:36:37.191
All right, kid.

1:40:01.295 --> 1:40:06.066
My share of mistakes

1:40:28.222 --> 1:40:32.760
To the bone

1:40:37.364 --> 1:40:42.169
Never too late

1:40:49.610 --> 1:40:54.681
To find her

1:41:13.734 --> 1:41:19.139
Could be rocky

1:41:19.239 --> 1:41:25.279
Than being alone

1:41:25.379 --> 1:41:30.150
Never too late

1:42:08.455 --> 1:42:11.325
And strong

1:42:16.797 --> 1:42:20.834
Between right and wrong

1:42:28.475 --> 1:42:32.980
I'm standing alone

1:42:37.284 --> 1:42:42.356
Never too late

1:42:46.493 --> 1:42:51.498
To find her

1:43:10.551 --> 1:43:14.988
Could be rocky

1:43:16.523 --> 1:43:22.162
Than being alone

1:43:22.229 --> 1:43:27.334
Never too late
