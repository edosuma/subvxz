00:03.120 --> 00:07.120
<b>Once someone comes out, 
follow their directions.</b>

00:09.850 --> 00:11.220
<b>It's been fun.</b>

00:11.220 --> 00:12.200
<b>Good luck.</b>

00:12.200 --> 00:13.740
<b>Yeah, thank you.</b>

00:18.740 --> 00:21.270
<b>Is this Mikhail's residence?</b>

00:21.980 --> 00:25.000
<b>Go do some shopping at 
Dick Sakura, by the station.</b>

00:25.220 --> 00:27.750
<b>At check out, give the cashier this card.</b>

00:30.530 --> 00:32.500
<b>Please come this way, sir.</b>

02:01.970 --> 02:07.020
<b>Strategy x And x Scheme</b>

02:11.920 --> 02:14.320
<b><i>There are more people this time.</i></b>

02:18.700 --> 02:20.870
<b><i>I wonder if there's anyone I know.</i></b>

02:23.020 --> 02:23.910
<b>Yo.</b>

02:24.190 --> 02:26.550
<b>Last year, you had your way with us.</b>

02:26.550 --> 02:28.980
<b>But that won't happen again.</b>

02:28.980 --> 02:32.170
<b>We've undergone some hellish training.</b>

02:32.730 --> 02:36.040
<b>Our teamwork is perfect now.</b>

02:39.300 --> 02:40.800
<b>Thank you for coming!</b>

02:42.170 --> 02:46.800
<b>This year, 1,489 applicants 
have made it this far,</b>

02:46.800 --> 02:52.060
<b>but the Phase Two examiner has asked me 
to trim that number to about 300.</b>

02:52.770 --> 02:54.760
<b>As for the exam...</b>

02:54.760 --> 02:56.840
<b>There are two hours before lunch.</b>

02:56.840 --> 02:58.690
<b>Defeat five people before then.</b>

02:59.400 --> 03:00.950
<b>Grab their tags when you defeat them,</b>

03:00.950 --> 03:03.200
<b>and see me when you have all five.</b>

03:03.510 --> 03:05.320
<b>I'll wait on the other side of the door.</b>

03:05.750 --> 03:06.500
<b>Got it?</b>

03:06.780 --> 03:08.580
<b>As soon as I shut the door,</b>

03:08.580 --> 03:10.580
<b>you may start.</b>

03:14.680 --> 03:17.840
<b>Every stage of the exam should be like this...</b>

03:18.770 --> 03:22.630
<b>You've gotta be strong to be a Hunter.</b>

03:29.980 --> 03:31.670
<b>Oh, you're here!</b>

03:31.670 --> 03:32.620
<b>Killuâ€”</b>

03:34.680 --> 03:35.860
<b>Sucks for you.</b>

03:36.290 --> 03:38.440
<b>I'm the only one passing this year.</b>

03:39.490 --> 03:41.820
<b><i>He's totally out of our league...</i></b>

03:42.970 --> 03:46.120
<b><i>So that's what it takes to 
become a top Hunter...</i></b>

03:46.760 --> 03:50.640
<b><i>This will be the last time I 
attempt the Hunter Exam...</i></b>

03:59.500 --> 04:00.950
<b>We finally have our first applicant.</b>

04:02.080 --> 04:04.160
<b>That took an hour and a half.</b>

04:04.600 --> 04:05.680
<b>What happened to everyone else?</b>

04:06.310 --> 04:07.330
<b>They're all asleep.</b>

04:10.300 --> 04:12.910
<b>It took me a while to collect all their tags.</b>

04:17.430 --> 04:19.300
<b>Is there going to be a second stage?</b>

04:21.910 --> 04:24.390
<b>That won't be necessary.</b>

04:24.390 --> 04:27.680
<b>He's demonstrated his skill.</b>

04:28.760 --> 04:31.320
<b><i>Killua, denizen of the darkness...</i></b>

04:31.750 --> 04:35.000
<b><i>He's returned much stronger.</i></b>

04:35.780 --> 04:39.030
<b>Applicant 1219, Killua-kun.</b>

04:39.030 --> 04:39.960
<b>Yeah.</b>

04:40.410 --> 04:41.460
<b>You've passed</b>

04:43.450 --> 04:44.480
<b>the Hunter Exam!</b>

04:50.560 --> 04:52.190
<b>Welcome back, Killua.</b>

04:52.190 --> 04:53.370
<b>How was the exam?</b>

04:53.370 --> 04:55.520
<b>I passed it in no time, naturally.</b>

04:56.170 --> 04:57.440
<b>Yay!</b>

04:58.120 --> 05:02.030
<b>Sorry to interrupt your celebration, 
but look at these spell cards.</b>

05:03.690 --> 05:05.040
<b>Wow...</b>

05:05.040 --> 05:06.990
<b>There's even an S-rank card!</b>

05:06.990 --> 05:09.110
<b>How much can we sell it for?</b>

05:09.110 --> 05:12.010
<b>Oh, let's go ask around!</b>

05:12.010 --> 05:14.540
<b>No, we should use it wisely.</b>

05:15.050 --> 05:16.740
<b>So what should we do?</b>

05:16.740 --> 05:19.110
<b>Well, I guess it's safe to hold on to it.</b>

05:19.530 --> 05:21.190
<b>With all these defensive spells,</b>

05:21.190 --> 05:23.300
<b>we don't need to worry 
about it getting stolen.</b>

05:23.960 --> 05:25.690
<b>Have you tried any of these?</b>

05:25.690 --> 05:27.650
<b>Just Blackout Curtain.</b>

05:27.650 --> 05:28.780
<b>What?</b>

05:28.780 --> 05:30.930
<b>If you have all these cards, 
you should use them...</b>

05:31.290 --> 05:33.730
<b>Start by using this one.</b>

05:33.730 --> 05:38.020
<b>You can choose a player you've 
met before, and talk to them.</b>

05:34.640 --> 05:38.020
<b>Contact

05:38.450 --> 05:40.090
<b>Who should we talk to?</b>

05:40.090 --> 05:42.030
<b>We won't know until we see who's available.</b>

05:42.640 --> 05:44.030
<b><i>Contact on!</i></b>

05:49.440 --> 05:51.660
<b>Oh, I see a lot of names.</b>

05:54.840 --> 05:55.840
<b>Hey, Gon...</b>

05:55.840 --> 05:57.560
<b>When did you run into him?</b>

05:57.560 --> 05:58.450
<b>Huh?</b>

06:02.250 --> 06:05.010
<b>Chrollo Lucilfer</b>

06:03.660 --> 06:04.570
<b>Chrollo?</b>

06:05.340 --> 06:07.120
<b>Who's Chrollo?</b>

06:07.120 --> 06:10.210
<b>I haven't seen Chrollo inside the game.</b>

06:10.210 --> 06:13.050
<b>Does that mean you guys passed 
each other without noticing?</b>

06:13.050 --> 06:14.640
<b>Huh? What are you talking about?</b>

06:14.900 --> 06:16.260
<b>That doesn't make sense.</b>

06:16.260 --> 06:19.020
<b>Kurapika sealed his <i>Nen</i>.</b>

06:19.270 --> 06:22.900
<b>Yeah, and you have to use 
<i>Nen</i> to enter the game.</b>

06:22.900 --> 06:24.620
<b>Who's Kurapika?!</b>

06:24.620 --> 06:26.320
<b>That only leaves...</b>

06:27.600 --> 06:29.630
<b>Let me in on this!</b>

06:33.110 --> 06:35.330
<b>I get it. So that's what's going on.</b>

06:36.910 --> 06:38.250
<b>Hey, Shal...</b>

06:38.250 --> 06:40.430
<b>Stop laughing, and explain 
what this is about.</b>

06:40.430 --> 06:41.830
<b>Sorry about that.</b>

06:41.830 --> 06:44.710
<b>Chrollo Lucilfer</b>

06:43.020 --> 06:44.710
<b>This probably isn't the boss.</b>

06:45.580 --> 06:47.840
<b>He hasn't purged the <i>Nen</i> from his body.</b>

06:49.030 --> 06:50.200
<b>Purging <i>Nen</i>?</b>

06:50.200 --> 06:51.090
<b>It's very doable.</b>

06:51.090 --> 06:52.050
<b>Seriously?</b>

06:52.050 --> 06:53.170
<b>Of course!</b>

06:53.170 --> 06:54.960
<b>If you can place <i>Nen</i> on others,</b>

06:54.960 --> 06:57.350
<b>it's not unreasonable to think 
<i>Nen</i> can be removed, as well.</b>

06:57.800 --> 07:02.100
<b>Does that mean Chrollo has removed 
Kurapika's <i>Nen</i>, and entered the game?</b>

07:02.360 --> 07:03.860
<b>Why would he be here?</b>

07:03.860 --> 07:05.500
<b>I'm not sure,</b>

07:05.500 --> 07:07.670
<b>but we should probably let Kurapika know.</b>

07:08.310 --> 07:10.600
<b>I'll leave the game real quick.</b>

07:10.600 --> 07:12.740
<b>You can use a spell card to leave.</b>

07:13.570 --> 07:14.800
<b>Save it.</b>

07:14.800 --> 07:16.440
<b>I can be out and back in four hours.</b>

07:18.350 --> 07:20.240
<b>I should have realized this sooner...</b>

07:20.500 --> 07:25.000
<b>Yorknew City                                        Greed Island</b>

07:21.210 --> 07:25.000
<b>This island is directly east of Yorknew City.</b>

07:27.410 --> 07:29.340
<b><i>East is the direction to go.</i></b>

07:29.340 --> 07:32.190
<b><i>You will find one who awaits you.</i></b>

07:32.750 --> 07:33.800
<b>I see.</b>

07:33.800 --> 07:36.600
<b>So the boss came here to find 
someone to purge that <i>Nen</i>.</b>

07:37.450 --> 07:40.760
<b>The boss arrived the same way we did,</b>

07:40.760 --> 07:42.260
<b>but then Razor kicked him out.</b>

07:42.260 --> 07:44.790
<b>That was when he realized 
this was Greed Island.</b>

07:45.300 --> 07:47.840
<b>But since the boss can't use <i>Nen</i>,</b>

07:47.840 --> 07:50.400
<b>he can't enter the island 
via the usual channels.</b>

07:50.920 --> 07:54.160
<b>So he must have hired someone 
to come to this island for him.</b>

07:54.750 --> 07:58.750
<b>He had them use his name 
as a hidden message to us.</b>

08:00.660 --> 08:04.010
<b>The one who can purge this 
<i>Nen</i> is on Greed Island.</b>

08:06.060 --> 08:08.550
<b>Change in plans again...</b>

08:08.820 --> 08:10.860
<b>Let's bring everyone else here.</b>

08:10.860 --> 08:14.290
<b>Yes, we'll all start looking 
for this <i>Nen</i> exorcist.</b>

08:14.290 --> 08:16.170
<b>I have a small correction.</b>

08:19.760 --> 08:20.990
<b>You're...</b>

08:20.990 --> 08:21.900
<b>Hisoka!</b>

08:22.820 --> 08:26.640
<b>It was my idea to use Chrollo's name.</b>

08:27.290 --> 08:30.690
<b>Because I didn't know you could 
enter any name you like</b>

08:30.690 --> 08:33.710
<b>until I was already inside...</b>

08:34.970 --> 08:36.390
<b>You should praise my initiative.</b>

08:36.790 --> 08:40.580
<b>Since I helped you understand Chrollo's message.</b>

08:40.940 --> 08:43.010
<b>Ah, so that's what this is about.</b>

08:43.490 --> 08:46.330
<b>I'm dying to kill you right here and now,</b>

08:46.620 --> 08:48.260
<b>but I'll let the boss do that.</b>

08:50.060 --> 08:53.550
<b>Well, if anything comes up, 
use Contact to get in touch.</b>

08:54.070 --> 08:57.020
<b>If I learn anything new, I'll let you know.</b>

08:58.360 --> 08:59.280
<b>Bye.</b>

09:02.680 --> 09:05.230
<b>So the boss hired Hisoka...</b>

09:05.640 --> 09:07.820
<b>He probably didn't have much 
choice, but it's still weird.</b>

09:07.820 --> 09:11.060
<b>And his reward is probably a duel, 
once the boss is cleansed.</b>

09:11.550 --> 09:14.150
<b>But now, it's only a matter of time</b>

09:16.060 --> 09:17.810
<b>until the boss comes back!</b>

09:20.430 --> 09:21.910
<b>I doubt it.</b>

09:22.280 --> 09:23.700
<b>I would know at once</b>

09:23.700 --> 09:28.660
<b>if <i>Nen</i> I placed on a spider 
had been removed.</b>

09:29.250 --> 09:33.370
<b>So when you chose your power, you 
knew something like this might happen?</b>

09:33.700 --> 09:34.810
<b>Of course...</b>

09:35.140 --> 09:37.230
<b>If you're able to place <i>Nen</i> on others,</b>

09:37.230 --> 09:40.350
<b>it only makes sense to assume</b>

09:40.350 --> 09:42.810
<b>that one can also remove <i>Nen</i>.</b>

09:44.020 --> 09:46.500
<b>Well, now you know.</b>

09:46.500 --> 09:48.060
<b>What you do from here is up to you.</b>

09:48.450 --> 09:50.010
<b>Thanks for taking the trouble.</b>

09:50.330 --> 09:51.340
<b>You have my gratitude.</b>

09:55.690 --> 09:56.740
<b>Did you need anything?</b>

09:59.410 --> 10:01.690
<b>What am I...</b>

10:02.360 --> 10:04.430
<b>What am I supposed to do this month?</b>

10:05.520 --> 10:06.570
<b>Tell me...</b>

10:07.150 --> 10:08.950
<b>What should I do?</b>

10:09.680 --> 10:12.150
<b>It'll be fine. Let me handle...</b>

10:12.150 --> 10:13.710
<b>What could you possibly know?</b>

10:14.270 --> 10:17.990
<b>You have no idea what's going 
to happen to us now!</b>

10:18.610 --> 10:19.990
<b>Neon... I need Neon!</b>

10:19.990 --> 10:21.800
<b>Restore Neon at once!</b>

10:24.930 --> 10:28.020
<b>Damn! Why did this happen?</b>

10:31.290 --> 10:32.870
<b>I wonder what's wrong...</b>

10:34.920 --> 10:37.000
<b>Why did it stop working?</b>

10:39.070 --> 10:39.990
<b>See ya.</b>

10:43.410 --> 10:46.430
<b>Looks like it's not the real Chrollo.</b>

10:46.430 --> 10:47.500
<b>Oh...</b>

10:47.750 --> 10:50.380
<b>Kurapika was pretty calm about it.</b>

10:50.750 --> 10:53.460
<b>Like he wasn't concerned or just didn't care.</b>

10:54.130 --> 10:57.010
<b>Well, it sounds like you 
got worried for nothing.</b>

10:57.010 --> 11:00.260
<b>Now it's time to focus on yourselves.</b>

11:00.540 --> 11:01.300
<b>Osu!</b>

11:01.300 --> 11:02.800
<b>Start with the basics...</b>

11:03.240 --> 11:04.760
<b>We're not going to train.</b>

11:05.210 --> 11:06.650
<b>It's time to start</b>

11:07.290 --> 11:09.530
<b>beating this game!</b>

11:15.440 --> 11:18.150
<b>It's said the legendary King Great White Beetle</b>

11:18.150 --> 11:20.080
<b>lives only on this tree!</b>

11:20.590 --> 11:23.120
<b>There's only one way to capture it!</b>

11:23.520 --> 11:25.450
<b>Hit the tree hard enough to shake it out.</b>

11:26.470 --> 11:28.370
<b><i>First comes rock!</i></b>

11:28.990 --> 11:30.160
<b><i>Rock, paper...</i></b>

11:30.160 --> 11:31.770
<b><i>Rock!</i></b>

11:36.390 --> 11:37.840
<b>Wow!</b>

11:37.840 --> 11:39.630
<b>It's raining bugs!</b>

11:40.500 --> 11:41.270
<b>Found it.</b>

11:41.880 --> 11:43.370
<b>Difficulty rank A!</b>

11:42.240 --> 11:45.140
<b>King Great White Beetle 

A legendary insect that 
releases pheromones 
which attract other insects 
to start a massive colony.
Can only leave the colony 
for brief evening walks.</b>

11:43.370 --> 11:47.040
<b>That's three King Great White Beetle cards!</b>

11:47.670 --> 11:50.270
<b>You could've gotten more if 
you'd thrown a real punch.</b>

11:50.780 --> 11:53.990
<b>Well, I didn't want to damage the tree.</b>

11:56.070 --> 11:58.280
<b>There is no such girl in this mansion.</b>

11:59.010 --> 12:01.930
<b>Even if there were, it would be impossible</b>

12:01.930 --> 12:04.830
<b>for you to bypass all the traps and find her.</b>

12:04.830 --> 12:06.280
<b>Found her.</b>

12:07.050 --> 12:09.140
<b>She was in a hidden room, 
four floors underground.</b>

12:09.140 --> 12:09.910
<b>What?</b>

12:09.910 --> 12:11.540
<b>Curse you!</b>

12:13.230 --> 12:16.170
<b>Got an A-rank Gold Dust Girl!</b>

12:13.400 --> 12:14.790
<b>Gold Dust Girl

12:16.170 --> 12:18.050
<b>The guard was a rank F.</b>

12:18.870 --> 12:21.640
<b>Next, let's head to the 
City of Gambling, Dorias!</b>

12:22.110 --> 12:24.440
<b>Wait, wasn't today supposed to be</b>

12:24.440 --> 12:26.360
<b>the monthly contest in Antokiba?</b>

12:26.360 --> 12:28.560
<b>We'll be passing through, so let's give it a go.</b>

12:30.730 --> 12:33.560
<b>Our winner is the Killua and Gon team.</b>

12:33.870 --> 12:36.560
<b>A Paladin's Necklace! Score!</b>

<b>And you only have to give us Night Jade,

<b>Just to be clear, this is our final offer.</b>

15:53.190 --> 15:55.620
<b>Tsezgerra is a careful man.</b>

15:55.620 --> 15:57.680
<b>He wouldn't try to pick a fight.</b>

16:03.930 --> 16:06.190
<b>he can obtain a Breath of Archangel.</b>

16:06.580 --> 16:11.110
<b>Does that mean they've assembled

16:11.360 --> 16:12.500
<b>It's possible.</b>

16:12.810 --> 16:16.200
<b>So they're waiting for Gain to be 
used on a Breath of Archangel.</b>

16:16.200 --> 16:22.710
<b>Night Jade 

A jewel blessed by the devil. 
When the holder is in danger, 
peril will be shifted to another.</b>

16:16.710 --> 16:19.050
<b>On the other hand, Night Jade is a card</b>

16:19.050 --> 16:20.660
<b>that we monopolized through hard work.</b>

16:21.300 --> 16:23.500
<b>If one of the cards were to be destroyed,</b>

16:23.500 --> 16:26.960
<b>one of our jade jewels would 
automatically turn into a card.</b>

16:27.850 --> 16:32.080
<b>Which means the A-rank 
Night Jade is much harder</b>

16:32.080 --> 16:35.220
<b>for them to get than the 
SS-rank Breath of Archangel.</b>

16:36.560 --> 16:38.150

<b>Kind of disappointing.</b>

17:00.560 --> 17:02.100
<b>I was so nervous...</b>

<b>Should've expected as much from

<b>You have a 0.01% chance of winning.</b>

17:26.200 --> 17:28.000
<b>That's one in ten thousand tries.</b>

17:28.000 --> 17:29.540
<b>So it all comes down to luck.</b>

17:29.900 --> 17:31.230
<b>Pretty risky.</b>

17:32.720 --> 17:33.740
<b>I know, Gon!</b>

17:33.740 --> 17:34.660
<b>Use that dice!</b>

17:35.050 --> 17:36.260
<b>This is it...</b>

17:36.260 --> 17:38.160
<b>If we get Good Luck, we can win!</b>

17:38.430 --> 17:40.420
<b>But if you get Bad Luck,</b>

17:40.420 --> 17:42.740

18:03.260 --> 18:06.640
<b>This die is the key to winning in this city.</b>

18:06.880 --> 18:10.950

18:10.950 --> 18:12.520
<b>Don't worry.</b>

18:12.520 --> 18:14.180
<b>It can't kill me...</b>

18:15.240 --> 18:18.160

18:18.420 --> 18:20.220

18:27.910 --> 18:31.290
<b>Yikes, his face is mush...</b>

18:32.670 --> 18:35.300
<b>Anyway, let's make the trade.</b>

18:35.550 --> 18:40.090
<b>Yeah, we want to get cards of rank S

18:40.460 --> 18:41.890

<b>No, we're trying to stay
