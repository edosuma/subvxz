WEBVTT

00:07.716 --> 00:10.969
I'm sorry, honey, but even
your actual crying is not believable.

00:10.969 --> 00:15.265
Next, "Beatrice Grus-- Grus"--

00:15.265 --> 00:17.100
Gruszczynski. That's me.

00:17.100 --> 00:20.562
Gruszczynski. There's a name
you'll never see in lights.

00:21.647 --> 00:24.316
Sweetie, I am looking
to represent glamorous ingenues,

00:24.316 --> 00:28.028
not Midwestern girls
who just could blend into the background.

00:28.028 --> 00:31.323
Well, the thing is,
I just arrived from Center Point, Indiana,

00:31.323 --> 00:33.992
to pursue my dream of being a star
in the motion pictures.

00:35.744 --> 00:38.121
Yeah, like every other girl in this town.

00:38.121 --> 00:40.415
Please. Is there anything I could do?

00:40.415 --> 00:44.169
Go back in time
and be born someone different.

00:44.169 --> 00:45.420
Sophia, come on.

01:07.776 --> 01:08.777
Are you Helen?

01:08.777 --> 01:10.195
Yes, I--

01:13.156 --> 01:14.199
Can I help you?

01:14.199 --> 01:15.742
We'll find out.

01:15.742 --> 01:18.871
I'm just in from New York. The Broadway
scene's become a bit of a bore,

01:18.871 --> 01:22.749
and my friends tell me
that you're the best agent in Los Angeles.

01:22.749 --> 01:26.753
Well, I'm intrigued.
Why don't you come back at 1:30?

01:26.753 --> 01:31.008
Fabulous, but make it 2:00. I'm meeting
my publicist for lunch at Romanoff's.

01:31.008 --> 01:34.052
Sorry, I-I--
I didn't catch your name, Miss...

01:34.803 --> 01:38.515
Davies. Diane Davies.

01:47.816 --> 01:50.819
And that's how Diane got her agent.

01:52.029 --> 01:56.783
You see, Hugo, Hollywood is all about
the right connections.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.619
I could use a good connection,

01:59.119 --> 02:02.039
as in, what's the connection
between this and Las Colinas?

02:03.749 --> 02:05.375
Don't be a smart-ass.

02:05.375 --> 02:09.253
This story is about
how the past can catch up with you.

02:10.130 --> 02:16.011
And Diane's past was closer to us
than we ever imagined.

02:17.429 --> 02:22.893
As you all know,
for the first time in Las Colinas history,

02:22.893 --> 02:26.772
we'll be hosting a Hollywood wrap party
here this evening.

02:30.317 --> 02:33.320
My friend, the famed producer,
Herbert Hayes,

02:33.320 --> 02:36.823
just finished shooting
his movie, <i>Coco Nutz!</i>,

02:36.823 --> 02:39.660
a hilarious caper about

02:39.660 --> 02:43.413
"two down-on-their-luck friends
go to Hawaii on spring break

02:43.413 --> 02:45.832
and get more than they bargained for."

02:46.542 --> 02:48.252
Well, move over, <i>Casablanca</i>.

02:48.919 --> 02:49.920
Ms. Davies?

02:49.920 --> 02:54.424
If the movie takes place in Hawaii,
why did they make it here?

02:54.424 --> 02:56.385
For the same reason
anyone shoots in Mexico.

02:56.385 --> 02:58.637
Our natural scenery.
-It's cheaper.

02:58.637 --> 03:02.307
So, everyone,
please make me look fabulous.

03:05.018 --> 03:10.315
This is a very important event,
so we need all hands on deck.

03:10.315 --> 03:12.901
Chad is passing out your assignments.

03:12.901 --> 03:14.653
The envelopes, please!

03:18.240 --> 03:20.576
Wrong crowd. That's okay.

03:20.576 --> 03:22.202
Meeting adjourned.

03:24.746 --> 03:25.747
Máximo.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.542
You have a special assignment.

03:29.168 --> 03:32.504
Diane requested that you be her
personal assistant at the party.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.966
Our plan to get you closer to her...

03:36.216 --> 03:37.634
is working.

03:40.095 --> 03:42.764
Yes! I get to hand out appetizers.

03:42.764 --> 03:45.726
Lucky.
I have to take care of Bud McKinley.

03:45.726 --> 03:48.187
Apparently, his regular person
got sick or something.

03:48.187 --> 03:49.605
Who's Mr. McKinley?

03:49.605 --> 03:51.732
You don't know who Bud McKinley is?

03:53.692 --> 03:55.235
Why, he's the star of the movie.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.112
You get to hang out with a movie star?

03:57.112 --> 03:59.239
Do you think you'll get
to go into the VIP area?

03:59.239 --> 04:01.033
I've never been a very important person.

04:01.033 --> 04:03.744
I've never even been an important person,
not even to my mother.

04:04.328 --> 04:07.998
I don't know. I just wish I could hide
in the crowd with a basic serving task

04:07.998 --> 04:12.544
instead of this fancy and very, very,
very, very glamorous assignment I've got.

04:15.422 --> 04:16.632
Well, we could switch jobs.

04:16.632 --> 04:18.257
You would do that for me?

04:18.257 --> 04:19.676
Oh, my God, Memo.

04:19.676 --> 04:22.721
I can't tell you how happy this makes me.
Really, I can't.

04:22.721 --> 04:27.059
Just be careful. I hear that
Mr. Bud McKinley is a real party animal.

04:27.059 --> 04:28.435
Okay.

04:29.728 --> 04:30.562
Hi, Julia!

04:31.438 --> 04:32.272
Hi!

04:32.606 --> 04:34.399
How is it going
with my sister at your apartment?

04:34.983 --> 04:36.860
Does she spend all day listening to music?

04:36.860 --> 04:39.613
No.
Sometimes she takes breaks to watch TV.

04:41.615 --> 04:44.826
Well, I can't thank you enough
for taking her in.

04:44.826 --> 04:45.786
Truly.

04:45.786 --> 04:48.455
<i>I was happy that Sara was in a good place,</i>

04:49.039 --> 04:52.543
<i>which was more than I could say for me
after my discussion with Fabián.</i>

04:52.543 --> 04:54.253
Máximo, my friend...

04:54.545 --> 04:58.340
are you as excited as I am for that
Hollywood party coming up?

04:58.340 --> 05:01.593
I can't wait to find out
what dirt you get for me.

05:02.761 --> 05:03.679
No...

05:03.846 --> 05:05.764
that was a one-time thing.

05:06.181 --> 05:07.349
I'm not doing that again.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.017
You're right.

05:09.017 --> 05:10.185
I'm sorry.

05:10.602 --> 05:14.857
It's just that in such a short time we've
made so many great memories together.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.567
Remember this one?

05:18.360 --> 05:19.611
And this one?

05:20.737 --> 05:21.947
And this one?

05:25.534 --> 05:30.247
Now, I would never tell you that if
you don't get me a scoop at the party,

05:30.497 --> 05:33.709
then I'll give these photos to Diane, but...

05:35.460 --> 05:36.628
Oops! I just said it.

05:37.421 --> 05:38.422
Got it?

05:38.422 --> 05:39.423
No! Please don't do that!

05:39.840 --> 05:40.799
I'd lose my job.

05:41.175 --> 05:42.551
My family needs that money-

05:42.551 --> 05:43.468
So...

05:44.136 --> 05:45.137
I can count on you?

05:46.805 --> 05:48.098
<i>The clock was ticking.</i>

05:48.098 --> 05:49.600
<i>My fate was on the line</i>

05:49.600 --> 05:52.853
<i>just as Las Colinas was getting ready
for its close-up.</i>

05:58.108 --> 06:01.945
Next week? No. No way.
You can't go away then.

06:01.945 --> 06:05.574
Diane, I delayed this trip twice already.

06:05.574 --> 06:07.534
It's my grandson's baptism.

06:08.619 --> 06:11.538
I get it. Family's important,
but this is business.

06:12.122 --> 06:13.957
Can't they do the baptism next year?

06:13.957 --> 06:16.460
Maybe wait till the kid can choose
his own religion.

06:16.460 --> 06:18.879
I have to be there for it, no matter what.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.423
Can I finish saying no to you later?

06:21.423 --> 06:24.426
This party is full of people
that I used to work with.

06:24.426 --> 06:25.928
And from now until it ends,

06:25.928 --> 06:29.264
I need to spend every single second
of my time focused on them,

06:29.264 --> 06:31.892
making sure they see
that I don't care about them anymore.

06:33.936 --> 06:35.312
Tabloids.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.023
I've always hated those vultures.

06:38.774 --> 06:42.277
I'm finally on the verge of stardom.
All that hard work is about to pay off.

06:42.277 --> 06:44.655
This role's a game changer for me.

06:44.655 --> 06:47.783
My name right next to Liz Taylor
and Jack Lemmon.

06:47.783 --> 06:49.576
The producers know you're pregnant.

06:49.576 --> 06:50.869
Jesus Christ!

06:52.496 --> 06:54.206
...is the best!

06:56.166 --> 06:57.668
Look, it's fine.

06:57.668 --> 07:00.587
It is not fine. This is your big chance.

07:00.587 --> 07:02.339
Plus, you're playing a nun.

07:02.339 --> 07:04.591
Now, you have to marry the father
right away.

07:04.591 --> 07:05.884
It's not that easy.

07:05.884 --> 07:07.970
I wish that getting married
were more difficult.

07:07.970 --> 07:09.763
I wouldn't have done it
five times already.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.723
What's wrong with staying on my own?

07:11.723 --> 07:14.810
The tabloids would have a field day
with this,

07:14.810 --> 07:17.896
so, please, just marry someone, anyone,

07:17.896 --> 07:20.357
or, otherwise,
the studio will replace you.

07:20.357 --> 07:23.986
Do you think anyone really cares what
Diane Davies does in her personal life?

07:26.196 --> 07:29.616
It's been two years already!
Why won't they let up?

07:29.616 --> 07:33.203
When a shark smells blood in the water,
it doesn't swim in the opposite direction.

07:33.203 --> 07:35.747
Well, you're my agent.
Can't you get me a job?

07:36.248 --> 07:37.624
I'll take any role.

07:37.624 --> 07:41.795
"Diane Davies. From America's sweetheart
to America's street tart."

07:42.671 --> 07:43.672
Well, that's clever.

07:43.672 --> 07:46.842
No, they're calling you a harlot,
a tramp, a villain...

07:46.842 --> 07:48.427
And those are the nice ones.

07:48.427 --> 07:50.888
Now, face it, honey. It's over.

07:50.888 --> 07:54.433
I mean, what kind of show is gonna
hire you with a reputation like that?

07:58.353 --> 07:59.730
Go ahead.

07:59.730 --> 08:04.776
Call me a harlot, a tramp, a villain!
That's what I am!

08:04.776 --> 08:06.028
And that's why

08:07.112 --> 08:08.739
I'm sleeping with your father.

08:10.949 --> 08:12.951
Cut! Very nice. Very nice, people.

08:12.951 --> 08:18.498
Congratulations, star of
the highest-rated daytime soap on TV.

08:19.082 --> 08:22.211
Dollface,
you know I never lost my faith in you.

08:22.211 --> 08:23.420
Come on.

08:24.379 --> 08:26.507
I've come a long way, Máximo.

08:26.507 --> 08:30.552
And now I get to finally show everyone
just how far that is.

08:31.261 --> 08:34.097
Watch as all the heads turn.

08:47.277 --> 08:49.238
Shall I walk down the stairs again?

08:52.157 --> 08:54.826
Hello. I'm Memo Reyes.

08:54.826 --> 08:58.330
I just have to say
I'm so excited to be your chaperone.

08:58.914 --> 09:02.042
I just-- I can't believe
I get to accompany you

09:02.042 --> 09:03.961
throughout the whole party, Mr. McKinley.

09:03.961 --> 09:06.630
What? No, I'm not Bud McKinley.

09:06.630 --> 09:07.714
That's Bud McKinley.

09:09.216 --> 09:12.678
Wait. That's the star of the movie?

09:14.680 --> 09:16.181
Bud McKinley's a dog?

09:19.685 --> 09:22.104
Bud McKinley is a real party animal.

09:22.104 --> 09:25.691
Don't forget that I'm saying this to you
now so you can remember it later on.

09:25.691 --> 09:29.236
Party animal. Animal. Okay? Good.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.280
And if you think
you're getting in the VIP area,

09:31.280 --> 09:32.906
you're barking up the wrong tree.

09:33.407 --> 09:36.743
Barking. Remember that I said that too.

09:37.953 --> 09:41.248
So, no VIP area?

09:41.248 --> 09:44.501
Just stay here, walk him every half hour.

09:44.501 --> 09:47.421
And he had a huge lunch, so watch out.

09:55.012 --> 09:56.013
Wait!

10:11.153 --> 10:15.574
I'm glad they actually put a
Mexican actor in this movie.

10:16.116 --> 10:16.950
Thank you.

10:17.284 --> 10:20.037
Now what did I see you in recently?

10:20.287 --> 10:23.123
I was in that mafia movie last year.

10:23.832 --> 10:26.210
I played a Mexican drug dealer.

10:26.418 --> 10:30.923
After that I was in a raunchy teen comedy.

10:31.381 --> 10:33.634
I played a Mexican drug dealer.

10:34.384 --> 10:35.802
But before that,

10:36.428 --> 10:39.556
I was in that futuristic
sci-fi space adventure.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.518
I played a Mexican drug dealer.

10:44.353 --> 10:47.147
That's why this film
was such a treat for me.

10:47.523 --> 10:48.941
Oh, really? What do you play?

10:49.566 --> 10:51.860
A Mexican drug <i>lord</i>.

10:54.279 --> 10:55.405
Hi, ladies!
-Hi!

10:55.405 --> 10:57.032
You look beautiful.
-Oh, my God.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.743
Did I just catch you
looking at another woman?

10:59.743 --> 11:03.580
Oh, no. I-- No. I-I-I feel like
I know her from LA. I just don't know how.

11:04.498 --> 11:06.166
Okay. Let me help.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.710
What are some ways I realized
I know someone?

11:08.710 --> 11:10.838
She was the cashier at your supermarket.
-No.

11:10.838 --> 11:12.381
You wore the same dress
to a bridal shower.

11:12.381 --> 11:13.465
Definitely no.

11:13.465 --> 11:15.551
You sabotaged her swimwear
right before a beauty pageant.

11:15.551 --> 11:17.052
What?

11:26.770 --> 11:28.522
Diane Davies!

11:28.522 --> 11:30.607
Hi. I'm Kara King.

11:30.607 --> 11:34.444
Wonderful to meet you.
You are such an inspiration.

11:35.112 --> 11:38.240
Well, thank you.
I'm a big fan of yours as well.

11:39.241 --> 11:40.576
"Kara," is it?

11:40.576 --> 11:42.160
We even have the same birthday.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.037
September 15th!

11:44.788 --> 11:49.501
Of course,
I was born 25 years after you, but still.

11:49.501 --> 11:50.669
Go Virgos!

11:54.214 --> 11:57.092
No way is she 25 years younger than me.

11:57.092 --> 12:00.387
You cannot believe the lies people tell
to stay in Hollywood.

12:00.387 --> 12:03.682
Thank God I left so I don't have to be
so fake all the time.

12:03.682 --> 12:07.352
Bobby, who does your hair?
You look fabulous!

12:17.196 --> 12:21.408
Máximo, see that man over there?
That's Herbert Hayes,

12:21.408 --> 12:24.369
the producer who fired me from
the film that would've made me a star.

12:24.953 --> 12:28.540
I hear he's thinking about using our
resort as a location for his next movie.

12:28.540 --> 12:30.709
Let's go tell him it's unavail.

12:30.709 --> 12:33.504
<i>Even though my job was to accompany Diane,</i>

12:33.504 --> 12:36.965
<i>I couldn't forget my other big assignment
for the night,</i>

12:36.965 --> 12:39.051
<i>find a scoop for</i> Espectacular<i>.</i>

12:39.551 --> 12:42.846
<i>And that canoodling couple
just might do the trick.</i>

12:42.846 --> 12:45.015
<i>I had to tell Fabián right away.</i>

12:45.516 --> 12:47.142
Should I get you a glass of champagne

12:47.142 --> 12:49.228
so you can celebrate
when you break his heart?

12:49.228 --> 12:51.772
Make it a bottle.
Then charge it to his room.

12:53.607 --> 12:55.901
Herbert, you old scoundrel.

12:56.401 --> 12:57.361
Look at you.

13:06.203 --> 13:07.996
That's what you call good gossip?

13:08.205 --> 13:09.790
That couple has been married
for three years!!

13:09.790 --> 13:10.707
TRUE LOVE!

13:10.707 --> 13:13.293
Hey, for a Hollywood couple that's
newsworthy, isn't it?

13:14.461 --> 13:16.922
I said I need something scandalous.

13:17.589 --> 13:19.424
You have an hour before I go live.

13:19.716 --> 13:22.511
Either you bring me
something juicy by then, or...

13:23.804 --> 13:25.305
well, I don't have to spell it out
for you.

13:28.517 --> 13:30.602
Or I'm giving those photos to Diane.

13:31.603 --> 13:32.604
You can go now.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.778
So, what do you think of all this?

13:39.778 --> 13:41.071
I love it.

13:41.071 --> 13:43.365
You know, in fact,
I was hoping for my next film--

13:43.365 --> 13:44.783
Let me stop you right there.

13:44.783 --> 13:48.161
We have no interest in renting out
the resort for your next big schlockfest.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.621
What?

13:49.621 --> 13:51.915
No, I don't want the resort.

13:52.583 --> 13:53.876
I want you, Diane.

13:53.876 --> 13:55.085
I'm sorry, what?

13:55.085 --> 13:57.838
Hollywood loves a good comeback story.

13:57.838 --> 14:00.674
So, what do you think?
A leading role in my new film?

14:00.674 --> 14:05.137
I've always thought you brought
such grace and subtlety to the screen.

14:08.056 --> 14:09.850
You were my chauffeur,

14:11.351 --> 14:13.270
and then you were my lover.

14:13.270 --> 14:18.108
And then you went back to being
my chauffeur, and then my lover again.

14:18.734 --> 14:21.278
And then you were
my orthopedic specialist.

14:21.778 --> 14:25.199
And then you were
my son's bar mitzvah tutor.

14:26.116 --> 14:31.038
Now you're my murderer.

14:47.262 --> 14:50.599
Thank you! I love you.

14:53.727 --> 14:57.856
I'm glad they killed me off.
Now I can get back into the movies.

14:57.856 --> 15:00.859
Dollface,
you are never getting back into movies.

15:00.859 --> 15:02.611
You're a tabloid punch line.

15:04.071 --> 15:07.824
Well, at least it's not another
headline about who Chad's father is.

15:11.912 --> 15:13.080
Isn't there anything I can do?

15:13.080 --> 15:16.208
Sorry, no. Y--
Movies wanna reach young kids.

15:16.208 --> 15:18.794
You know, and all of your fans
are middle-aged housewives.

15:18.794 --> 15:21.547
Just... Honey, face it. It's over.

15:21.547 --> 15:25.300
But, on the plus side, you look fantastic.

15:25.300 --> 15:28.053
It's too bad you can't
build a career out of that, huh?

15:34.101 --> 15:36.186
<i>One, two...</i>

15:36.770 --> 15:39.565
<i>Glutes of Gold</i> is number one
on the Betamax charts,

15:39.565 --> 15:41.567
and your line of shakes is blowing up.

15:43.151 --> 15:46.113
Dollface, I never lost my faith in you.

15:46.113 --> 15:48.532
Well, I just had to reinvent myself again.

15:48.532 --> 15:50.409
But I did it on my own terms.

15:50.409 --> 15:53.328
I hope this sends a message
that women can do anything

15:53.328 --> 15:56.248
if they act with certainty and confidence.

15:56.248 --> 15:59.293
I-I-I-I don't know.

15:59.293 --> 16:02.546
I-I-I-I'm not sure. I-- I'm flattered. I--

16:02.546 --> 16:06.466
I know, I know. This is a-- a crazy idea.
I mean, clearly, you've moved on with--

16:06.466 --> 16:07.926
I want that part!

16:08.844 --> 16:09.887
Then it's yours.

16:09.887 --> 16:11.763
We just have one small hurdle.

16:11.763 --> 16:14.850
I have to sell you
to the big wigs at the studio.

16:14.850 --> 16:16.894
You know, you're just so glamorous.

16:16.894 --> 16:19.313
Thank you. That's just who I am.

16:19.313 --> 16:21.440
Well, this character
is the total opposite.

16:21.440 --> 16:23.567
I-I can change. What's the role?

16:23.567 --> 16:28.572
Well, she's just a normal Midwestern girl
who blends in with the background.

16:29.156 --> 16:30.199
You're kidding.

16:30.782 --> 16:35.078
So, you think that you could
maybe give me your take on the character?

16:35.078 --> 16:36.788
Not a problem.

16:36.788 --> 16:39.041
You'll find there's no more down-home,

16:39.041 --> 16:42.461
salt of the earth,
no-frills woman than me.

16:42.461 --> 16:46.381
The very, very expensive champagne
you asked for, Ms. Davies.

16:46.381 --> 16:48.133
Terrible timing.

16:48.133 --> 16:51.136
Just meet me in my office in ten,
and stick the champagne in my suite.

16:52.012 --> 16:53.180
I'll be right back.

16:55.265 --> 16:56.934
I'm sorry, Mr. McKinley...

16:56.934 --> 16:59.269
it's not that I'm not excited
to be with you.

16:59.811 --> 17:02.022
It's just that I thought
you were a real celebrity.

17:03.649 --> 17:04.483
Bud, where are you going?

17:05.192 --> 17:07.653
Bud McKinley, stop this instant. Stop.

17:08.237 --> 17:10.531
Bad dog. Very, very bad, bad dog.

17:10.531 --> 17:12.574
Hey, you. You mind turning this way?

17:12.574 --> 17:15.368
We wanna get some shots
of Bud with his handler.

17:15.368 --> 17:16.453
What's your name?

17:18.288 --> 17:20.832
M-Memo. Memo Reyes.

17:33.512 --> 17:37.599
Excuse me, sir.
Shall we show you two to the VIP area?

17:39.434 --> 17:40.894
Yeah? Welcome.

17:40.894 --> 17:41.979
Thank you.

17:41.979 --> 17:44.523
Good dog. Very, very good dog.

17:51.446 --> 17:52.739
Ms. Davies?

17:53.323 --> 17:55.868
I haven't thought of Indiana
in a long time.

17:58.120 --> 18:00.998
During the drought,
my dad got behind on his payments,

18:01.540 --> 18:03.667
then the bank came and took the farm away.

18:04.459 --> 18:06.211
Our family never recovered.

18:07.713 --> 18:09.006
Dad fell apart.

18:10.215 --> 18:13.010
Mom tried to be our rock, but she...

18:16.013 --> 18:17.014
I'm sorry.

18:18.015 --> 18:20.517
Diane, it's okay.

18:21.852 --> 18:23.437
It's more than okay.

18:23.437 --> 18:27.274
I knew looking at these old photos
would help get me into character.

18:27.274 --> 18:28.692
Now, how do I look?

18:29.276 --> 18:32.404
Glamorous, as always.
-Damn my effortless elegance.

18:32.404 --> 18:35.866
I'm gonna have to change
into something... ordinary.

18:36.366 --> 18:37.534
I'll be right back.

18:43.373 --> 18:44.416
Ms. Davies?

18:45.584 --> 18:50.672
<i>Suddenly I had in my hand
exactly what I needed for Fabián.</i>

18:50.672 --> 18:55.469
<i>The biggest piece of celebrity dirt
I could have ever imagined.</i>

18:56.053 --> 18:57.679
<i>A picture of Chad...</i>

18:58.722 --> 19:00.098
<i>with his father.</i>

19:01.058 --> 19:03.268
For the past two decades,

19:03.268 --> 19:06.480
Diane's refusal to reveal
the truth about Chad's father

19:06.480 --> 19:08.440
only made people more curious.

19:08.440 --> 19:11.568
So, if you gave Fabián the photo,

19:11.568 --> 19:14.071
it would solve
all your <i>Espectacular</i> problems.

19:15.906 --> 19:18.867
But it would also be
a huge betrayal to my boss.

19:18.867 --> 19:22.454
<i>How could I live with myself
if I gave Fabián that photo?</i>

19:23.247 --> 19:25.958
<i>But how could I keep my job if I didn't?</i>

19:25.958 --> 19:27.793
<i>I needed to talk to Don Pablo.</i>

19:48.981 --> 19:49.982
Don Pablo.

19:50.858 --> 19:51.984
I have a big problem.

19:52.609 --> 19:55.445
What do you do when you have to choose
between protecting yourself

19:55.445 --> 19:57.114
or being loyal?

19:57.114 --> 20:00.033
It's not a decision
anyone should have to make,

20:00.951 --> 20:04.454
but, lately, I've been wondering

20:04.454 --> 20:08.750
if, perhaps, loyalty doesn't get rewarded
as much as it should.

20:10.335 --> 20:12.588
So, what should I do?

20:13.714 --> 20:15.966
<i>Then I saw the look,</i>

20:16.550 --> 20:18.427
<i>that powerful look Don Pablo had</i>

20:18.427 --> 20:21.555
<i>when he was about to impart
some true pearl of wisdom.</i>

20:22.973 --> 20:24.474
I haven't a clue.

20:26.685 --> 20:28.187
<i>Time was running out,</i>

20:28.187 --> 20:32.024
<i>and I had nothing to offer Fabián
except the photo in my pocket.</i>

20:34.818 --> 20:37.196
Oh, my God, I just figured it out.

20:37.196 --> 20:38.280
Come on.

20:39.907 --> 20:42.242
Joanna Schiller?
-Yeah?

20:42.826 --> 20:45.454
Wait-- I go by Kara King now.

20:45.454 --> 20:47.789
I knew it. You're Nancy's older sister.

20:47.789 --> 20:49.833
The one who always bought us booze
in high school.

20:49.833 --> 20:52.127
Man, those keggers were epic.

20:52.127 --> 20:53.420
Thank you.

20:54.213 --> 20:55.797
It's so good to see you.

20:57.716 --> 21:00.761
Oh, gosh, I hope she doesn't tell my mom
I was drinking in high school.

21:01.595 --> 21:05.098
<i>At that moment,
seeing how Kara reacted to Chad,</i>

21:05.098 --> 21:08.519
<i>and remembering what she told Diane
about her age,</i>

21:08.519 --> 21:10.687
<i>a lightbulb went off in my head.</i>

21:10.687 --> 21:15.192
<i>I realized I might just have
the scoop Fabián was looking for.</i>

21:15.192 --> 21:16.401
See, Hugo,

21:16.401 --> 21:21.365
all guests checking into Las Colinas
had to provide a copy of their ID,

21:21.865 --> 21:25.953
which means I had proof
of Kara's real identity

21:25.953 --> 21:28.956
<i>and the fact that she was much older
than she claimed.</i>

21:32.251 --> 21:34.711
Trust me, Herb, I still love state fairs

21:34.711 --> 21:37.130
and hayrides and corn whatever.

21:37.130 --> 21:41.343
Nobody's more of a down-home
Midwestern gal than I am.

21:41.343 --> 21:44.763
See, I even say "gal."
That's both folksy and endearing.

21:44.763 --> 21:48.725
Wow. I mean, that look,
that-- that voice is so...

21:50.310 --> 21:51.353
ordinary.

21:51.979 --> 21:53.313
Well, I'm convinced.

21:53.313 --> 21:55.649
Consider the role good as yours.

21:55.649 --> 21:57.568
How wonderful. Thank you, Herb.

21:59.570 --> 22:01.822
Sorry. Fabián Solares is outside.

22:02.823 --> 22:08.036
He found proof that a certain starlet
is ten years older than she claims to be.

22:08.620 --> 22:11.456
He is about to go live
with this information.

22:11.456 --> 22:14.209
Seriously? We have to stop him.

22:14.209 --> 22:17.588
I thought you didn't like her.
You said she was fake and a liar.

22:17.588 --> 22:19.673
She is, but that doesn't matter.

22:19.673 --> 22:22.217
These gossip vultures never let up.

22:22.384 --> 22:28.724
And we're live outside Las Colinas
with an exclusive story!

22:28.724 --> 22:31.977
Stop it this instant.
Don't you dare say another word.

22:31.977 --> 22:33.270
I don't care if you're live.

22:35.606 --> 22:39.151
I am so fed up with people like you

22:39.151 --> 22:42.112
preying on innocent women,
criticizing our every move.

22:42.112 --> 22:45.616
We're the ones who expose ourselves
to the public,

22:45.616 --> 22:48.368
brave enough to chase our dreams,

22:48.368 --> 22:52.289
while you hide in the shadows
like vampires,

22:52.289 --> 22:54.249
just trying to destroy us.

22:54.249 --> 22:56.251
Well, it's not gonna happen here.

22:56.752 --> 22:58.170
Not at my resort.

22:58.170 --> 23:01.006
Okay, no one here's a vampire.
Let's all try to calm down.

23:01.006 --> 23:02.674
You listen to me. I will sue!

23:02.674 --> 23:04.301
I will sue all of--

23:11.141 --> 23:13.352
I know things are tough with Sara.

23:14.394 --> 23:15.395
But,

23:15.395 --> 23:16.813
it will get better.

23:18.232 --> 23:19.900
At least Máximo stays out of trouble.

23:21.360 --> 23:22.194
I guess you're right.

23:24.655 --> 23:26.198
Why don't we watch some TV?

23:26.865 --> 23:28.200
It always calms you down.

23:28.575 --> 23:30.911
Maybe don't think about family
for a while.

23:36.083 --> 23:37.876
<i>I will sue. Do you know who I am?</i>

23:38.752 --> 23:39.670
Is that my Máximo!?

23:39.670 --> 23:40.963
Uh.... um...

23:41.588 --> 23:42.965
<i>Nobody gives a--</i>

23:44.508 --> 23:45.342
Um...

23:45.551 --> 23:47.177
And... How about we play...

23:47.386 --> 23:48.387
Hide and Seek?

23:48.554 --> 23:49.972
I'll count. One...

23:49.972 --> 23:51.473
Two... Three...

23:51.473 --> 23:56.311
Do you know who I am?
I am a 1977 Daytime Emmy Award nominee.

23:56.311 --> 23:59.106
Okay. Okay. I won't say anything.

23:59.857 --> 24:01.024
Let's go to commercial.

24:02.651 --> 24:03.735
Thank you.

24:04.403 --> 24:05.988
No, thank you.

24:06.530 --> 24:09.241
We got all this on tape.
It is a gold mine.

24:09.241 --> 24:11.034
I'm going to replay it for months.

24:12.327 --> 24:13.787
Do what you want to me.

24:14.454 --> 24:17.332
But don't even think about
messing with my guests.

24:17.833 --> 24:20.169
Diane! Can we get a comment?
-Máximo, I'm going to change

24:20.169 --> 24:22.546
and head back to the party.
-Wait! Please! Diane!

24:23.255 --> 24:24.965
I'll give you a little more time,

24:25.257 --> 24:26.091
but now...

24:26.592 --> 24:27.467
you really owe me.

24:30.762 --> 24:33.640
So, I managed to keep my job after all,

24:33.640 --> 24:36.059
but in order to do so,

24:36.894 --> 24:39.605
I had come close to hurting other people.

24:41.398 --> 24:42.983
Who was I becoming?

24:42.983 --> 24:44.067
Finally.

24:44.067 --> 24:46.653
We're getting to the part
where you turn into a ruthless,

24:46.653 --> 24:49.489
cutthroat businessman
despised by everyone.

24:49.489 --> 24:52.618
Okay, you're way too excited
for that part of my story.

24:52.618 --> 24:54.745
I'm a sucker for the juicy parts.

24:54.745 --> 24:58.665
Well, as it should happen,
things were about to get really juicy.

25:04.171 --> 25:05.839
I said, "Fine. It's your money."

25:06.798 --> 25:10.761
Herb, I appreciate your offer
more than you know,

25:10.761 --> 25:12.971
but I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass.

25:12.971 --> 25:16.475
Really? I thought this was
everything you ever wanted.

25:16.475 --> 25:18.936
I spent my life reinventing myself,

25:18.936 --> 25:21.688
all to survive in a city
that loved to knock me down.

25:22.523 --> 25:26.860
Acapulco is where I thrive.
And I'm exactly who I wanna be here.

25:27.903 --> 25:30.864
Good luck to you, Herb.
Have a safe trip home.

25:34.660 --> 25:37.871
Yeah, she was completely wrong
for the part.

25:39.248 --> 25:41.959
Congratulations, Ms. Davies,
on a wonderful night.

25:41.959 --> 25:44.545
Thank you, Máximo.
Come have a drink with me.

25:47.256 --> 25:50.008
You did a great job tonight
and it won't go unnoticed.

25:50.008 --> 25:51.718
But, first thing tomorrow,

25:51.718 --> 25:54.805
we need to figure out
who leaked that information to Fabián.

25:57.307 --> 26:00.060
Don Pablo, come celebrate!

26:00.644 --> 26:03.272
I'm afraid you have to celebrate
without me.

26:04.398 --> 26:05.399
What's this?

26:06.650 --> 26:10.696
Thank you for the opportunities
and the friendship you've given me here.

26:12.573 --> 26:14.449
But now that this party is over,

26:14.449 --> 26:16.493
I must leave Las Colinas

26:17.619 --> 26:20.122
to be with my family in Mexico City.

26:20.706 --> 26:23.625
It has become clear that I cannot do both.

26:24.501 --> 26:29.047
That is my resignation letter,
effective immediately.

26:32.426 --> 26:33.886
Máximo.

26:36.430 --> 26:38.473
I am very proud of your achievements.

26:39.474 --> 26:42.144
We've succeeded in our plan to
bring you closer to our friend.

26:44.104 --> 26:46.190
I know you will go very far
without my help.

26:47.232 --> 26:48.609
Good luck, kid.

27:11.215 --> 27:13.050
<i>Decades earlier,</i>

27:13.050 --> 27:16.261
<i>Don Pablo had chosen Las Colinas
over his own family.</i>

27:16.887 --> 27:18.180
<i>On this night...</i>

27:20.516 --> 27:22.601
<i>he finally took the other path.</i>

27:48.752 --> 27:52.381
Hugo, earlier you were looking
for a connection,

27:52.381 --> 27:54.716
a reason that I was telling this story.

27:55.592 --> 27:56.885
Do you see it now?

27:57.594 --> 28:00.806
Sure. The way life always...

28:02.015 --> 28:03.267
No. No idea.

28:03.851 --> 28:07.604
Holy crap. Your uncle is trying to decide
if he should visit someone from his past.

28:07.604 --> 28:10.732
What he's wrestling with is,
should he follow in the steps of Don Pablo

28:10.732 --> 28:13.277
who seized his chance
to repair an old relationship,

28:13.277 --> 28:16.488
or emulate Diane
who decided to let go of her past?

28:16.488 --> 28:18.574
Each one made the right decision
for themselves,

28:18.574 --> 28:20.534
so what's the right decision for him?

28:21.702 --> 28:23.245
He doesn't talk much,

28:23.245 --> 28:26.164
but when he does, it's electric.

28:27.457 --> 28:29.585
I'm gonna go check on that extra stop.
-Yep.

28:30.836 --> 28:33.255
So, what do you think I should do?

28:34.756 --> 28:36.258
Hard for me to say,

28:36.258 --> 28:39.595
especially since you won't tell me
who you're thinking of seeing.

28:40.179 --> 28:41.388
We'll get there.

28:42.181 --> 28:47.853
Luckily, we're about to visit someone
who just might have the answer.

28:51.773 --> 28:52.816
Excuse me.

28:55.736 --> 28:56.737
What?

28:57.321 --> 28:58.322
Wow.

28:58.822 --> 29:02.075
I cannot believe
what I'm seeing right now.

29:02.576 --> 29:03.577
Hi.

29:05.621 --> 29:08.707
Dad, some dude's here to see you!

29:09.875 --> 29:11.084
"Some dude"?

29:11.710 --> 29:14.338
I flew in for your preschool
graduation ceremony.

29:15.422 --> 29:16.965
It sucked, by the way.

29:18.800 --> 29:19.801
Máximo?

29:21.595 --> 29:23.764
Hello, old friend.

29:24.848 --> 29:26.183
My Memo.

29:27.476 --> 29:28.477
Wow.

29:29.186 --> 29:30.562
He called me "some dude."

29:30.562 --> 29:32.022
Memito!
