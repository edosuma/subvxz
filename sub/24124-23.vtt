WEBVTT

00:00.166 --> 00:03.333
I gotta get goin'

00:03.333 --> 00:06.958
a friend of mine

00:08.583 --> 00:11.416
he's just Pooh Bear

00:13.958 --> 00:17.458
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.458 --> 00:21.125
I know he's out there

00:24.458 --> 00:28.000
we're so adventurous

00:28.000 --> 00:31.166
and again

00:31.166 --> 00:34.875
and there's nobody home

00:34.875 --> 00:38.291
to count on a friend

00:38.291 --> 00:41.833
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.875 --> 00:45.583
please?

00:45.583 --> 00:48.750
I got to be there

00:50.750 --> 00:54.166
Winnie the Pooh

01:19.208 --> 01:22.333
What a nice day.

01:22.333 --> 01:24.875
Too bad there's no one
to play with.

01:27.708 --> 01:29.000
Dear!

01:29.000 --> 01:30.833
Either this tree
doesn't like me,

01:30.833 --> 01:32.458
or the sky's falling.

01:32.458 --> 01:34.500
Oh! Hello, Pooh.

01:34.500 --> 01:36.500
Would you like to come down
and play with me?

01:36.500 --> 01:39.375
I'd like to, Piglet,

01:39.375 --> 01:43.375
only I'm rather busy
at the moment...

01:43.375 --> 01:45.416
gathering honey, you know.

01:45.416 --> 01:47.083
- Pooh!

01:47.083 --> 01:50.250
But Pooh, there's no beehive
in that tree.

01:50.250 --> 01:54.416
That's why I've disguised
myself as the sun.

01:54.416 --> 01:57.250
to trick the bees
into building their beehive

01:57.250 --> 01:59.500
in a nice warm spot.

01:59.500 --> 02:02.000
Oh, bother.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.708
Maybe I can help.

02:05.708 --> 02:08.958
I'll dress as a sun
and join you.

02:08.958 --> 02:14.000
Actually, I don't think that
would be a very good idea,
Piglet.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.708
If the bees see two suns,
they might get suspicious.

02:18.708 --> 02:20.458
I understand.

02:21.875 --> 02:24.875
- Hello, Tigger.

02:24.875 --> 02:26.750
Would you like to play with me?

02:26.750 --> 02:30.458
No time, Piglet.
I got a lot of bouncing to do.

02:30.458 --> 02:32.291
But I can bounce with you.

02:32.291 --> 02:34.125
Sorry. Where I'm bouncing,

02:34.125 --> 02:36.125
no tigger has bounced before.

02:36.125 --> 02:37.625
And that includes piglets.

02:37.625 --> 02:39.500
-

02:41.833 --> 02:43.375
I understand.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.458
Hello, Rabbit, Eyeore.

02:47.458 --> 02:49.375
Would you like to play with me?

02:49.375 --> 02:51.250
No. Not now, Piglet.

02:51.250 --> 02:53.875
Can't you see we're
finishing Eyeore's house?

02:53.875 --> 02:56.291
Not much of a house.

02:56.291 --> 02:59.416
Just right for
not much of a donkey.

02:59.416 --> 03:01.583
Ooh! Perhaps I can help.

03:04.250 --> 03:06.333
Should have known.

03:06.333 --> 03:08.333
Oh, I'm sorry, Eyeore.

03:08.333 --> 03:10.333
Now look what you've done.

03:10.333 --> 03:13.333
Why don't you find
someone else to play with?

03:13.333 --> 03:14.625
Anyone else.

03:14.625 --> 03:17.125
But there isn't anyone else.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.375
Why does everyone ignore
a very small animal?

03:31.375 --> 03:35.291
If only I could find a very
small friend to play with.

03:35.291 --> 03:36.958
Oh!

03:36.958 --> 03:39.458
Maybe I can play
with my shadow.

03:39.458 --> 03:42.125
Tweet, tweet.

03:42.125 --> 03:44.500
Woof, woof.

03:46.708 --> 03:47.625
Yipes!

03:47.625 --> 03:50.291
Ooh, dear.

03:50.291 --> 03:53.291
Maybe we should play something
a little less scary.

03:53.291 --> 03:54.500
Okay?

03:54.500 --> 03:55.500
Okay.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.833
How about a game of catch?

04:00.166 --> 04:02.166
Here it comes.

04:03.291 --> 04:04.708
Good! Here comes another one.

04:06.291 --> 04:08.583
Ooh! Catch it! Catch this one!

04:13.416 --> 04:16.458
Oh, my! You're very good
at playing ball.

04:16.458 --> 04:18.708
You're the "friendiest" friend
I ever had.

04:18.708 --> 04:22.500
I bet you'd never ignore me
like all my other friends?

04:23.708 --> 04:26.000
Oh, my! Oh, dear!

04:26.000 --> 04:29.333
Piglet's invented
a make-believe playmate.

04:29.333 --> 04:31.000
And he's talking to it.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
All our fault.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.875
Shouldn't have ignored him.

04:34.875 --> 04:37.708
Next, he'll invent
more and more of them.

04:37.708 --> 04:39.416
Oh, I hope not.

04:39.416 --> 04:42.333
I can hardly remember
all my real friends.

04:42.333 --> 04:44.958
without make-believe ones, too.

04:44.958 --> 04:48.250
- I've got it!
- A make-believe friend?

04:48.250 --> 04:52.000
No, no, no!
An idea how we can show Piglet

04:52.000 --> 04:53.958
how much we care for him.

04:53.958 --> 04:56.875
Oh, that's a wonderful idea,
Rabbit.

04:56.875 --> 04:59.875
By the way, what is the idea?

04:59.875 --> 05:02.458
No time to explain now.

05:02.458 --> 05:04.583
We have work to do.

05:08.458 --> 05:10.375
Piglet, dear friend,

05:10.375 --> 05:13.291
would you like to come out
and play?

05:13.291 --> 05:17.083
Oh, no, thank you, Rabbit.
I'm busy playing catch
with my shadow.

05:17.083 --> 05:20.083
He's making friends
with shadows?

05:20.083 --> 05:22.166
Oh, the poor little guy.

05:25.166 --> 05:28.375
If there's one thing
Piglet can't resist--

05:28.375 --> 05:31.166
...it's fireflies.

05:31.166 --> 05:32.458
Yeah!

05:34.208 --> 05:36.708
We're going to catch
more fireflies.

05:36.708 --> 05:39.000
Wouldn't you like to come along?

05:39.000 --> 05:41.625
Do you think I could have
my very own net?

05:41.625 --> 05:44.250
Why, certainly... friend.

05:45.583 --> 05:47.583
Oh, I can hardly wait.

05:52.583 --> 05:55.833
Shadow! I'm home!

05:55.833 --> 05:58.458
Come on out
and meet my friends!

05:58.458 --> 06:00.250
Shadow? Where are you?

06:03.000 --> 06:05.625
Oh, dear.
It's a note from my shadow.

06:05.625 --> 06:07.291
I hurt his feelings.

06:07.291 --> 06:09.250
He's-- He's run away!

06:09.250 --> 06:11.000
Oh, now the poor little fella's

06:11.000 --> 06:13.375
leaving himself
make-believe notes.

06:13.375 --> 06:16.875
But it's true.
My shadow is gone. Look.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.166
Why, he's right.

06:25.166 --> 06:29.875
Oh, how could I have treated
my very own shadow so badly?

06:29.875 --> 06:31.958
Oh, poor Piglet.

06:31.958 --> 06:33.583
Fear not, Piglet old pal,

06:33.583 --> 06:36.375
finding lost shadows
is what tiggers do best.

06:36.375 --> 06:39.458
Aha! The perfect shadow hideout!

06:45.250 --> 06:48.208
Oh, my! Are you shadow?

06:53.000 --> 06:55.125
I suppose not.

06:55.125 --> 06:58.583
Oh, Shadow? Are you in there?

06:58.583 --> 07:00.500
With all the shadows in there,

07:00.500 --> 07:04.000
Piglet's is probably
somewhere less crowded.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.875
I know I'd be,
if I were a shadow...

07:07.875 --> 07:11.000
which I'm not,
being a donkey.

07:12.208 --> 07:14.583
Oh, shadow! You've come home!

07:16.708 --> 07:20.083
Oh, dear.
You're not my shadow.

07:20.083 --> 07:24.416
No, Piglet, it's mine.
I thought you might borrow it,

07:24.416 --> 07:26.958
until yours returns.

07:26.958 --> 07:30.833
It's all right, shadow,
he's a friend of mine.

07:35.458 --> 07:36.708
- Pooh: Oof!

07:44.208 --> 07:48.083
Oh, thank you, Pooh.
But somehow it's sort of--

07:48.083 --> 07:50.583
- sort of--
- I know.

07:50.583 --> 07:53.416
Rather Pooh-ish.

07:53.416 --> 07:55.250
Step aside, step aside.

07:55.250 --> 07:57.291
Why use an old Pooh shadow,
Piglet?

07:57.291 --> 07:59.958
Here. Have mine.
It's bouncier.

08:02.500 --> 08:05.416
Oh, dear!
It is bouncy!

08:05.416 --> 08:08.250
Yeah! Takes after yours truly.

08:10.625 --> 08:13.166
Wait a minute!
Where you goin'?

08:15.000 --> 08:16.708
Hey! Come back!

08:16.708 --> 08:18.000
It's running away!

08:18.000 --> 08:19.833
Quick! After it!

08:29.125 --> 08:30.958
This is all my fault.

08:30.958 --> 08:33.625
If only I hadn't ignored
my shadow.

08:33.625 --> 08:35.458
- Shadow?

08:35.458 --> 08:37.750
Is-- Is that you?

08:42.125 --> 08:44.458
Shadow!

08:46.000 --> 08:47.833
Shadow!

08:54.875 --> 08:56.500
-

08:56.500 --> 08:58.000
I must be brave.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.625
I must be brave.

08:59.625 --> 09:01.416
I must be brave.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.750
Oh, there you are.

09:07.125 --> 09:09.125
Oh, there you're not.

09:11.958 --> 09:14.166
Oh, dear.

09:14.166 --> 09:16.208
I wonder where I am.

09:16.208 --> 09:17.833
Perhaps I--

09:17.833 --> 09:19.166
No, I'm not there.

09:19.166 --> 09:22.166
Then I must be--

09:22.166 --> 09:24.500
Oh, I'm not there, either.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.458
- Oh, what was that?

09:26.458 --> 09:30.166
Oh, it's you!
Oh, please come home
with me, shadow.

09:30.166 --> 09:32.583
I know I treated you badly,

09:32.583 --> 09:35.416
and you have every right
to be angry with me,

09:35.416 --> 09:38.166
but I am very sorry,

09:38.166 --> 09:40.875
and-- and-- and I promise

09:40.875 --> 09:43.083
I'll never, never--

09:43.083 --> 09:44.375
Yipes!

09:50.333 --> 09:52.708
Oh, what to do, what to do...

09:53.833 --> 09:56.708
Psst! Shadow!

10:00.000 --> 10:02.250
- No, not "tweet, tweet."

10:02.250 --> 10:04.500
-

10:04.500 --> 10:07.500
Not "woof, woof."

10:10.166 --> 10:11.875
Oh, shadow, you're back.

10:11.875 --> 10:14.208
I'll never make you do
scary hand shadows again.

10:20.875 --> 10:23.000
I'll save you, shadow.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.583
Yipe!

10:25.583 --> 10:27.125
You stay back,

10:27.125 --> 10:28.833
or I'll, uh...

10:30.583 --> 10:33.708
I guess I got rid of them,
huh, shadow?

10:33.708 --> 10:35.708
Shadow?

10:35.708 --> 10:37.125
Oh, dear.

10:37.125 --> 10:38.875
I guess I got rid of you, too.

10:40.708 --> 10:43.708
Oh, I'll probably
never see him again,

10:43.708 --> 10:45.708
and it's all my fault.

10:49.291 --> 10:51.583
If only I had my shadow back,

10:51.583 --> 10:55.000
why, we'd be inseparable,

10:55.000 --> 10:56.416
like peanut butter and jelly--

10:56.416 --> 10:59.708
...only less sticky,

10:59.708 --> 11:01.375
that is,
if he'd ever forgive me.

11:01.375 --> 11:02.458
Shadow?

11:02.458 --> 11:05.375
Oh, shadow, you've come home!

11:05.375 --> 11:06.583
Haven't you?

11:07.958 --> 11:10.000
Ooh!

11:14.291 --> 11:17.458
I guess I'm kind of tired, too.

11:17.458 --> 11:19.166
Good night, shadow.

11:19.166 --> 11:21.416
You've made me the...

11:21.416 --> 11:25.833
happiest piglet in the world.

11:52.208 --> 11:55.583
There! A meal fit
for a Pooh Bear.

11:55.583 --> 11:58.583
I do hope he likes
the best-friend lunch
I'm giving him.

11:58.583 --> 12:00.625
After all,
he is my best friend.

12:00.625 --> 12:02.000
Perfect.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.166
Nothing can go wrong now.

12:05.166 --> 12:07.750
Piglet, stay calm.

12:07.750 --> 12:11.875
There's no reason
to panic over one, little--

12:13.375 --> 12:14.625
Oh, dear.

12:14.625 --> 12:16.291
Now there is a reason
to panic.

12:20.166 --> 12:23.708
Oh, I do enjoy
best-friend lunches.

12:23.708 --> 12:26.208
especially the part
where you ask for seconds.

12:26.208 --> 12:28.750
- Excuse me, tummy,

12:28.750 --> 12:31.250
- but was that you
who just went--
-

12:31.250 --> 12:33.375
I suppose not.

12:35.708 --> 12:37.166
Hello, Piglet.

12:37.166 --> 12:39.458
I brought you
a best-friend present.

12:39.458 --> 12:41.250
It's honey,

12:41.250 --> 12:44.708
because that's your
best friend's favorite food.

12:46.208 --> 12:48.333
Why, you're very welcome,
I'm sure.

12:48.333 --> 12:49.708
Pooh!

12:49.708 --> 12:52.625
I have the--

12:52.625 --> 12:54.583
Oh, I love games.

12:54.583 --> 12:56.625
Hiccup! Hiccup!

12:57.833 --> 12:59.458
Hiccup!

12:59.458 --> 13:01.625
- Hiccup! Hiccup!
- But I'm not playing a--

13:04.750 --> 13:08.166
Oh, I believe you win, Piglet.

13:08.166 --> 13:09.958
Now can we eat?

13:09.958 --> 13:11.958
But, Pooh, I've--

13:11.958 --> 13:13.583
...got--

13:13.583 --> 13:16.708
...the--

13:17.875 --> 13:21.000
For me?
Why, thank you!

13:24.000 --> 13:25.250
There.

13:25.250 --> 13:26.750
That's better.

13:26.750 --> 13:29.583
Oh, my.
I like it very much, Piglet.

13:29.583 --> 13:31.750
Is it a picture of me?

13:33.875 --> 13:37.375
Why didn't you say so?
I'm hungry, too.

13:37.375 --> 13:41.208
Oh, and don't forget
the best-friend gift,

13:41.208 --> 13:44.208
- best friend.
-

13:44.208 --> 13:48.291
Oh, my. Piglet doesn't seem
at all in a luncheoning mood.

13:48.291 --> 13:51.750
And my best-friend gift
isn't to his liking.

13:53.125 --> 13:54.500
But-- Ooh!

13:54.500 --> 13:57.083
- Maybe I offended him?
-

13:57.083 --> 13:59.416
Perhaps it's better
for me to leave.

14:04.583 --> 14:07.291
And good-bye
to you too, Piglet.

14:09.083 --> 14:11.250
Pooh! Please don't--

14:11.250 --> 14:13.125
Oh, dear.

14:21.416 --> 14:23.333
Oh.

14:23.333 --> 14:24.458
Oh, my.

14:24.458 --> 14:27.250
The hiccups really gone.
Good.

14:27.250 --> 14:30.291
Now I can apologize to Pooh
and ask him back for lunch.

14:36.458 --> 14:38.208
Ooh, how "extraordilary."

14:38.208 --> 14:41.125
An "unidentifried"
bouncing Piglet.

14:41.125 --> 14:44.458
I'm sorry, Tigger,
but I got the--

14:46.458 --> 14:49.208
Hey, buddy boy, did you know
you got the "hic-cufflinks?"

14:50.750 --> 14:54.166
Oh, but don't fret, small-fry.

14:54.166 --> 14:57.958
I'll get rid of them for you,
or my name ain't, uh,

14:57.958 --> 14:59.375
whatever it is my name ain't.

14:59.375 --> 15:01.000
-

15:03.000 --> 15:05.083
Now, the best way
to get rid of "hic-cufflinks"

15:05.083 --> 15:06.833
is by drinking lots of water.

15:06.833 --> 15:09.250
"Hic-cufflinks" is crummy
swimmers, you know.

15:09.250 --> 15:11.708
If you'll excuse me, Tigger--

15:11.708 --> 15:14.708
...I must go find--

15:14.708 --> 15:17.291
I think they already found you,
buddy boy.

15:17.291 --> 15:20.208
- See?

15:20.208 --> 15:22.208
I told you it would work.

15:24.875 --> 15:27.625
Oh, worry not, dear friend.

15:27.625 --> 15:30.708
My great, great,
great uncle Ebenezer,

15:30.708 --> 15:32.708
on my mother's side,

15:32.708 --> 15:35.875
had a surefire cure
for the hiccups.

15:35.875 --> 15:38.166
It's really quite simple.

15:38.166 --> 15:39.708
If the hiccups can't hiccup,

15:39.708 --> 15:42.375
then they'll have to "hic-down."

15:42.375 --> 15:45.083
You can't argue with
"logisticals" like that.

15:45.083 --> 15:48.958
- Um, Owl?
- Yes, Piglet?

15:51.375 --> 15:53.875
I say, Tigger, this is no good.

15:53.875 --> 15:56.208
Maybe not,
but you have to admit,

15:56.208 --> 15:59.250
the little guy sure makes
a dandy pogo stick.

16:00.750 --> 16:03.750
It's terrifical!
It's fantastical!

16:03.750 --> 16:05.583
It's-- What is it?

16:05.583 --> 16:07.875
It's a hiccup trap, of course.

16:07.875 --> 16:11.125
Yeah! And it looks like
a pretty good one at that!

16:11.125 --> 16:13.208
But before we can capture them,

16:13.208 --> 16:15.875
we must first trick
the hiccups out.

16:15.875 --> 16:18.875
Now, you lie down.
Pretend to be asleep.

16:18.875 --> 16:22.083
Then will you let me find--

16:22.083 --> 16:23.958
Anything you say, Piglet.

16:23.958 --> 16:25.750
Whatever that is.

16:25.750 --> 16:28.708
Now, go ahead and make
some snoozin' noises.

16:31.625 --> 16:34.250
I sure hope we bag our limit.

16:39.291 --> 16:42.250
Hooray! We caught a hiccup!

16:42.250 --> 16:45.250
If you didn't want me
to eat the cake,

16:45.250 --> 16:48.708
why'd you leave it
lying around?

16:48.708 --> 16:50.708
Hey, how about that?

16:50.708 --> 16:54.458
Them "hic-cufflinks"
look a lot like Eyeore's.

16:54.458 --> 16:56.458
Hmm...

16:56.458 --> 17:00.958
There was something
very unusual about Piglet today,

17:00.958 --> 17:04.625
although I can't quite put
my finger on it.

17:04.625 --> 17:07.416
Perhaps he wasn't feeling well.

17:07.416 --> 17:10.583
Maybe I should bring him
a feeling better gift.

17:10.583 --> 17:13.333
But what does one give a piglet

17:13.333 --> 17:14.875
who has everything?

17:15.833 --> 17:18.500
I know! Honey!

17:27.625 --> 17:30.166
This is a surefire way
to cure you, Piglet.

17:30.166 --> 17:32.833
All we gotta do
is frighten them out.

17:32.833 --> 17:37.458
Deep down, all "hic-cufflinks"
are cowardly little
scaredy-cats.

17:37.458 --> 17:40.458
But so am I.

17:40.458 --> 17:43.125
- Oh, dear.

17:45.208 --> 17:48.333
Boy, oh, boy!
This is gonna be great!

17:53.875 --> 17:58.375
Oh, what kind of
stumpedy-bumpedity
are you?

17:58.375 --> 18:00.000
That couldn't even scare
a Piglet!

18:00.000 --> 18:02.375
You want to sound convincing,

18:02.375 --> 18:05.625
try to put some more "oohs"
in your "oohs."

18:05.625 --> 18:08.458
Ooh! Ooh!

18:08.458 --> 18:11.000
Piglet's hiccups won't know
what hit him.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.166
Yes.

18:13.166 --> 18:17.000
A jar of honey is
the perfect friendly gift.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.375
It always makes me feel
perfectly friendly.

18:23.250 --> 18:24.875
Oh, bother.

18:24.875 --> 18:28.083
Friendliness doesn't go
as far as it used to.

18:28.083 --> 18:29.416
Empty again.

18:31.583 --> 18:32.875
Oof!

18:32.875 --> 18:34.125
Oh, bother.

18:40.583 --> 18:42.166
You guys ready?

18:42.166 --> 18:45.500
Rabbit: Owl!
Watch where you're stepping!

18:45.500 --> 18:48.000
Owl: Oh, dreadfully sorry.

18:50.291 --> 18:53.958
- Piglet: What was that?
-

18:53.958 --> 18:56.500
It's the real
stumpedy-bumpedity!

18:56.500 --> 18:59.208
- Yah!
- Rabbit: Oh, my!

18:59.208 --> 19:01.125
Run for your lives!

19:04.083 --> 19:05.250
It's after us!

19:09.875 --> 19:11.875
Oh, dear.

19:11.875 --> 19:14.208
It's so quiet.

19:16.458 --> 19:18.166
Whoa!

19:29.125 --> 19:31.458
Oof!

19:33.333 --> 19:35.250
Help!

19:37.416 --> 19:39.333
Hello, Piglet.

19:39.333 --> 19:41.750
Oh, Pooh! You saved me?

19:41.750 --> 19:42.958
I did?

19:42.958 --> 19:46.333
And you got rid of my hiccups.

19:46.333 --> 19:49.458
Oh, so that's what was wrong?

19:49.458 --> 19:51.333
You had the hiccups.

19:51.333 --> 19:53.000
Why didn't you say so?

19:53.000 --> 19:54.458
I couldn't,
I had the hiccups.

19:54.458 --> 19:57.000
- When?
- When I wasn't saying so.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.708
Oh, well,
now that that's settled,

20:00.708 --> 20:03.000
why don't we have
our friendship lunch?

20:03.000 --> 20:05.375
But it's after dinner, Pooh.

20:05.375 --> 20:07.333
Don't worry, Piglet.

20:07.333 --> 20:09.833
We can have a friendship
dinner, too.

20:17.458 --> 20:19.833
I can't take another step.

20:19.833 --> 20:21.750
You'd better go on without me.

20:21.750 --> 20:24.333
Save yourselves.

20:25.833 --> 20:27.750
Sound good to me, long ears.

20:27.750 --> 20:29.208
Let's go, Owl.

20:30.833 --> 20:33.708
I'm sorry, Tigger,
but I'm a noble animal.

20:33.708 --> 20:36.500
I can't leave Rabbit.
I will stay, too.

20:38.125 --> 20:39.583
Okay by me, buddy bird.

20:39.583 --> 20:41.708
Well, ta-ta for now.

20:45.500 --> 20:47.375
Now, I couldn't stay away

20:47.375 --> 20:50.125
and leave my bestest friends
for dessert.

20:50.125 --> 20:54.750
Well, just have to face
that stumpedy-bumpedity...

20:54.750 --> 20:56.416
What am I saying?

20:56.416 --> 20:58.625
Oh, dear!
It's getting closer!

20:58.625 --> 21:02.375
Yeah, and it's got noisey feet.

21:02.375 --> 21:04.208
It's come to get us!

21:04.208 --> 21:06.333
Good-bye, Rabbit.

21:06.333 --> 21:07.708
Good-bye, Owl!

21:07.708 --> 21:09.708
Good-bye, Tigger!

21:09.708 --> 21:11.625
Hello, Rabbit!

21:11.625 --> 21:13.875
Hello, Owl!
Hello Tigger!

21:13.875 --> 21:15.416
Hey!

21:15.416 --> 21:17.333
Either we made a boo-boo,

21:17.333 --> 21:19.875
or them spookables look
like Buddy Bear and Piglet.

21:19.875 --> 21:21.583
I say, Piglet,

21:21.583 --> 21:23.416
what happened to your hiccups?

21:23.416 --> 21:25.875
My very best friend Pooh
got rid of them

21:25.875 --> 21:27.208
when he saved my life.

21:27.208 --> 21:29.333
Oh, wonderful!

21:29.333 --> 21:31.208
Splendid job!

21:31.208 --> 21:33.375
Good old Pooh Boy!

21:35.833 --> 21:39.000
Wait! If them "hic-cufflings"
are gone from Piglet,

21:39.000 --> 21:41.875
then where did they go?

21:45.875 --> 21:46.875
Uh-oh.

21:46.875 --> 21:49.583
Oh, my.

21:49.583 --> 21:51.416
Well--

21:55.583 --> 21:59.458
- Whatever shall we do?
- Don't worry.

21:59.458 --> 22:02.000
I know the best ways
to get rid of hiccups.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.750
First, water.

22:03.750 --> 22:05.458
Hiccups are crummy swimmers,
you know.

22:50.458 --> 22:53.500
Winnie the Pooh Bear

22:55.458 --> 22:57.583
please?

22:57.583 --> 23:00.750
I got to be there

23:02.458 --> 23:06.333
Winnie the Pooh
