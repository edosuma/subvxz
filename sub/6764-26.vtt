02:47.634 --> 02:50.660
David, it was beautiful,
until you got to that point.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.498
It was terrible. I wasn't even close.

02:52.672 --> 02:54.936
Yes, you were,
until you got to that point.

02:55.341 --> 02:57.741
Well, no matter how much I practice,
I'll still be faking it.

02:57.911 --> 02:59.606
- I don't even know what I'm doing.
- David.

02:59.779 --> 03:01.974
In high school,
I thought I was some kind of prodigy.

03:02.148 --> 03:04.013
But now I'm surrounded
by all these music majors

03:04.184 --> 03:06.379
and it just made me realize
what a joke I am.

03:06.553 --> 03:09.283
Yeah, well, how many of those music
majors almost got a record deal?

03:10.190 --> 03:11.782
Donna, that's rock 'n' roll.

03:11.958 --> 03:14.392
Well, I thought your professor said
you were talented.

03:14.561 --> 03:15.619
Yeah.

03:15.795 --> 03:17.956
Right before he told me
I should start taking lessons.

03:18.131 --> 03:20.827
So take the lessons
and you'll get better.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.934
What's wrong
with asking for a little help?

03:23.102 --> 03:25.627
Come on, play it again.
I like it, and so does Rocky II.

03:27.073 --> 03:30.304
All right, fine.
One lesson, but that's it.

03:30.476 --> 03:32.535
And if the teacher gets on my case,
I'm out of there.

03:35.148 --> 03:36.672
We're never gonna make it there
on time.

03:36.849 --> 03:39.716
Would you relax? We're ten minutes
from Dodger Stadium.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.478
This is the first home game
of the season.

03:41.654 --> 03:44.452
Do you have any idea what I had to do
to get tickets behind home plate?

03:44.624 --> 03:45.784
No, but you're gonna tell me.

03:45.959 --> 03:48.484
- I can't believe we're gonna miss it.
- We're not gonna miss it.

03:48.661 --> 03:51.824
The Auto Club will be here.
We still got plenty of time.

03:51.998 --> 03:53.522
Now what's wrong?

03:53.700 --> 03:55.031
No dial tone.

03:55.201 --> 03:56.225
Great.

03:56.402 --> 03:59.838
Hey, look, there's a coffeehouse
with a payphone. Let's go.

04:02.208 --> 04:03.800
Listen, why don't you sit down,
all right?

04:03.977 --> 04:06.138
I'll go call the tow truck,
you order us a cappuccino.

04:06.312 --> 04:09.839
I don't want a cappuccino.
I want a Dodger Dog, all right?

05:00.733 --> 05:03.133
Good news, buddy, the tow truck
will be here in less than 20.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.237
- What did you order us?
- Nothing, let's get out.

05:05.405 --> 05:08.033
Steve, we just got here.
Let's relax a minute, okay?

05:08.207 --> 05:09.333
I'll wait outside.

05:09.509 --> 05:12.410
It's not gonna get here
any faster, Steve.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.406
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with me?

05:15.982 --> 05:17.882
Don't you see anything strange
about this place?

05:19.819 --> 05:21.286
What?

05:21.721 --> 05:25.521
Brandon, we're sitting
in a gay coffeehouse.

05:29.929 --> 05:31.954
It's funny.
It doesn't really look any different.

05:32.131 --> 05:34.725
- Except that it's all guys in here.
- Right.

05:34.901 --> 05:37.734
So let's get out of here before
any of them get any ideas, okay?

05:37.904 --> 05:40.395
Steve, will you take it easy?

05:40.573 --> 05:42.871
They're not gonna cop a feel
over a cup of coffee.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.314
Ryan, what is it?

05:52.485 --> 05:56.421
Just one of the brothers
from the KEG house.

05:58.691 --> 06:00.181
Here I thought I was the only one.

06:00.560 --> 06:01.891
Are you gonna say anything to him?

06:03.096 --> 06:04.290
No, not now.

06:05.331 --> 06:06.992
Looks like he's busy.

06:10.269 --> 06:12.567
You guys, I don't get it.
Why put out a calendar in April?

06:12.739 --> 06:13.899
We have to get it ready now

06:14.073 --> 06:16.200
so it'll go on sale
when the fall semester starts.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.310
And we're gonna print
all the school events on it.

06:18.478 --> 06:20.742
Football games, homecoming,
vacations.

06:20.913 --> 06:22.346
And all the money goes to charity.

06:22.515 --> 06:23.641
- That's great.
- Yeah.

06:23.816 --> 06:25.841
If we could ever get anybody
to pose for it.

06:26.018 --> 06:28.043
So far, everyone's passed

06:28.221 --> 06:30.553
but Glenn Williams,
the varsity quarterback,

06:30.723 --> 06:33.556
Mike Ryan and Artie Devers
from the KEG house.

06:33.726 --> 06:36.820
<i>The same guys who drool over the
swimsuit issue of Sports Illustrated.</i>

06:36.996 --> 06:38.054
Exactly.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.256
You ask them to pose
and they start laughing at you.

06:40.433 --> 06:41.866
Oh, that's not the worst part.

06:42.034 --> 06:45.003
Chuck Morgan, the head cheerleader?
He thought I was hitting on him.

06:45.371 --> 06:46.895
Hey, what about Dylan?
Did you ask him?

06:49.876 --> 06:51.537
Are you kidding? He was the worst.

06:52.145 --> 06:56.343
"I don't know, Kel, sort of degrading
being treated like a sex object. "

06:56.916 --> 06:58.440
Well, I didn't even ask David.

06:58.618 --> 07:00.643
He was in such a bad mood
this morning.

07:00.820 --> 07:03.288
Here you go, Andrea. A megaburger.

07:03.456 --> 07:04.889
- Thank you.
- Okay.

07:06.359 --> 07:08.623
Maybe you should park yourself
next to the grill.

07:11.664 --> 07:13.097
Well, I am eating for two.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.290
Or three.

07:15.034 --> 07:16.729
More like four?

07:16.903 --> 07:19.303
- Hey, D.
- Hey, guys, how was the game?

07:20.106 --> 07:21.130
Don't ask.

07:21.307 --> 07:23.605
We got there just in time
for the top of the fourth inning.

07:23.776 --> 07:26.973
After the Dodgers had scored...
Six runs? Six?

07:27.146 --> 07:28.545
My 'Stang broke down.

07:28.714 --> 07:31.478
- How about Brandon?
- Oh, there's an idea.

07:31.651 --> 07:32.675
I don't know.

07:32.852 --> 07:34.843
The worst thing he can do is say no.

07:35.021 --> 07:36.579
You're right. I'll give it a try.

07:39.592 --> 07:42.322
Hi, guys. How was the game?

07:42.495 --> 07:43.894
- Cool it.
- Okay.

07:44.430 --> 07:46.261
- Brandon?
- Yes.

07:46.432 --> 07:47.865
I don't know if you've heard yet,

07:48.034 --> 07:50.434
but the Alphas are trying
to make a huge donation

07:50.603 --> 07:52.400
to the Downey House
for runaway teens.

07:52.572 --> 07:54.472
I know you'd wanna do
whatever you can to help.

07:54.640 --> 07:55.834
What do you got in mind, Kel?

07:56.008 --> 07:57.942
We're putting together a calendar
and we're asking

07:58.110 --> 08:01.011
all the most respected guys
on campus to pose for it.

08:01.180 --> 08:03.205
And we all think
that you should be one.

08:03.382 --> 08:05.350
Well, thanks, I'll definitely be there.

08:05.518 --> 08:07.383
Great.
Okay, the shoot is on Saturday.

08:07.553 --> 08:09.214
Come by the Alpha house
on Friday afternoon

08:09.388 --> 08:10.514
for a wardrobe fitting, okay?

08:12.792 --> 08:15.522
Wardrobe? What kind of wardrobe?

08:16.762 --> 08:18.730
Well, you get to pick it.

08:18.898 --> 08:20.331
What kind of wardrobe, Kelly?

08:22.068 --> 08:23.126
Boxer shorts.

08:31.744 --> 08:33.678
You wanna photograph me
in my underwear?

08:34.313 --> 08:35.337
Isn't it degrading?

08:35.515 --> 08:37.710
I mean, these women,
they treat us like sex objects.

08:37.884 --> 08:40.409
I think that you and I
have already had this conversation.

08:40.953 --> 08:43.649
You know, Kel, I don't think
the dean would think too highly

08:43.823 --> 08:47.190
of his task force rep
posing for a pinup calendar.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.123
It's not a pinup calendar.

08:49.295 --> 08:51.286
I'll do it, Kelly. Anything for charity.

08:51.464 --> 08:53.022
Steve, no doubt you're a hunk,

08:53.199 --> 08:55.099
but we've already got two guys
from the KEG house

08:55.268 --> 08:57.259
and we're trying to field
sort of a cross-section.

08:57.436 --> 08:59.597
But you'll definitely be on the B-list.

09:00.606 --> 09:01.766
- B-list?
- B-list?

09:01.941 --> 09:03.568
We'll call you if anybody backs out.

09:03.743 --> 09:04.937
Thanks.

09:05.111 --> 09:07.511
What do you say, Brandon?

09:09.649 --> 09:13.642
Sure, Kel. I'll do it.
As long as we're not...

09:49.422 --> 09:52.983
David Silver?
Right on time, I like that.

09:53.159 --> 09:54.183
I'm Holly Marlow.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.323
That was incredible. What was it?

09:56.495 --> 10:00.795
<i>Schubert's Impromptus in E-flat.
I'm playing at a recital Friday night.</i>

10:00.967 --> 10:03.401
I'm afraid
it still needs a lot more work.

10:03.569 --> 10:05.400
What, are you kidding?
It was perfect.

10:05.571 --> 10:09.200
Perfect? No, it was passable.

10:09.542 --> 10:10.975
Well, you could have fooled me.

10:11.143 --> 10:12.872
Well, why don't we get started?

10:13.045 --> 10:16.037
I think you said
you were working on the Mozart.

10:16.215 --> 10:18.115
Did you bring it with you?

10:19.151 --> 10:20.448
Yeah, it's right here.

10:21.120 --> 10:24.920
If you really wanna have fun with me,
you can rearrange the furniture.

10:30.262 --> 10:33.629
I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were...

10:33.799 --> 10:36.290
Blind. It's okay, you can say it.

10:37.770 --> 10:39.704
Well, it's just that
when we talked on the phone...

10:40.072 --> 10:41.937
I didn't sound like a blind person?

10:43.976 --> 10:46.103
It just seems like something
you would have mentioned.

10:46.278 --> 10:48.212
To be honest,
I was afraid that if I told you,

10:48.381 --> 10:51.373
it might scare you off,
and I really could use this job.

10:51.984 --> 10:53.576
But since you're already here,

10:53.753 --> 10:56.119
why don't you give me a try
and see how you like it?

10:56.288 --> 10:57.880
And after that, it's up to you.

11:00.292 --> 11:02.123
Great. Where do we start?

11:02.294 --> 11:04.762
You sit down and play for me.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.233
Right.

11:29.789 --> 11:32.690
Loosen up. Don't be afraid of it.

11:32.858 --> 11:36.225
Let the music play you,
not the other way around.

11:50.810 --> 11:51.868
I'm sorry.

11:52.044 --> 11:56.276
Your fingering is all wrong there.
Try doing the crossover like this.

12:06.492 --> 12:08.790
- I should have figured.
- No, you're doing fine.

12:08.961 --> 12:11.862
Let's go back a few bars
and try it again.

12:18.871 --> 12:21.135
- I can't believe I got it.
- Keep playing. Don't stop.

12:23.476 --> 12:26.843
You're water-skiing on a lake
in the mountains.

12:27.012 --> 12:28.946
Feel the spray on your face.

12:29.615 --> 12:32.277
Hear the wind in your hair.

12:33.219 --> 12:34.948
Don't get locked on the page.

12:35.121 --> 12:36.247
Look away from it.

12:38.457 --> 12:40.015
You know what's coming.

12:42.094 --> 12:46.656
Think of something that makes you
feel as free as the music.

12:59.879 --> 13:02.370
That's it. Now you got it.

13:10.422 --> 13:13.516
Some guys will do
for a little attention.

13:14.126 --> 13:15.354
Pathetic, isn't it?

13:15.528 --> 13:18.122
All the babes from the Alpha house
checking me out

13:18.297 --> 13:20.458
to make sure my boxers fit
in all the right places.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.624
While you're at it,
why don't you walk around campus

13:22.802 --> 13:24.269
in a trench coat
and flash everyone?

13:24.436 --> 13:26.700
- Hey, that's my specialty.
- Hey, Steve.

13:27.273 --> 13:28.467
How you doing?

13:29.675 --> 13:31.870
Can I get you something?
Cappuccino?

13:33.779 --> 13:34.803
No, thanks.

13:34.980 --> 13:37.039
You sure you wouldn't
like a cappuccino?

13:38.784 --> 13:40.274
I never touch the stuff.

13:40.452 --> 13:41.646
Oh, really?

13:41.821 --> 13:43.948
I thought I saw you yesterday
having a cappuccino.

13:50.596 --> 13:52.587
Let's get one thing straight.

13:52.765 --> 13:55.290
I have never had a cappuccino.

13:55.835 --> 13:58.497
Hey, Steve, it's cool, look...

13:59.505 --> 14:02.065
You don't know how great it is
just to finally realize

14:02.241 --> 14:03.503
that I'm not the only one here.

14:05.911 --> 14:07.003
Are you crazy?

14:07.746 --> 14:09.304
I was on my way
to a Dodger game, okay?

14:09.481 --> 14:12.416
The car broke down, and I was
only in there to use the phone.

14:13.118 --> 14:15.586
Okay.
So who was the guy you left with?

14:16.055 --> 14:18.421
It was Brandon Walsh.
And he's not gay either.

14:23.295 --> 14:25.229
You're not gonna tell the other guys,
are you?

14:26.265 --> 14:28.859
Hey, Ryan, get over here.

14:36.775 --> 14:37.833
Yeah, what's up?

14:38.010 --> 14:40.410
I got a little theory going.
Let's see if it pans out.

14:40.579 --> 14:43.571
Keith can't face the fact that nobody
wants to see him in his underwear.

14:43.749 --> 14:46.217
You ever date Leslie Sumner?

14:46.385 --> 14:49.286
Yeah.
Five of the best months of my life.

14:49.455 --> 14:51.582
But you know how Leslie is.
She's always moving on.

14:51.757 --> 14:52.883
See? What did I tell you?

14:53.058 --> 14:55.288
The only guys they asked
are Leslie's old boyfriends.

14:55.461 --> 14:57.554
I don't think so.

15:10.843 --> 15:13.107
Maybe I should have
my head examined.

15:13.279 --> 15:15.611
I mean, I just don't think
standing around in his underwear

15:15.781 --> 15:17.578
is something Bill Clinton
would have done.

15:17.750 --> 15:18.876
Brandon, who are you kidding?

15:19.051 --> 15:20.575
Clinton's campaign
wasn't going anywhere

15:20.753 --> 15:22.118
until he played the sax on TV.

15:22.288 --> 15:23.482
Yeah, but not in his underwear.

15:23.656 --> 15:26.853
I don't know. I think people like their
leaders to have the common touch.

15:27.026 --> 15:29.119
Son, Walsh blood flows
in those veins.

15:29.295 --> 15:33.026
It's time you accepted your destiny.
You are a sex symbol.

15:35.634 --> 15:37.465
You know, Brandon,
I might be able to get Kelly

15:37.636 --> 15:40.969
to get you some underwear
with the presidential seal on it.

15:43.309 --> 15:45.334
Hey, man. Come on in.

15:45.511 --> 15:47.376
What's the matter?
Still on the B-list?

15:47.546 --> 15:49.013
It's better than the she-list.

15:49.181 --> 15:50.205
The she-list?

15:52.017 --> 15:55.851
What are you saying? Mike Ryan,
the president of your fraternity, is gay?

15:57.823 --> 16:00.587
Why didn't you tell me
you saw him in there?

16:00.759 --> 16:02.886
I didn't know how to deal with it.

16:03.929 --> 16:05.362
I guess I was hoping it wasn't true.

16:05.531 --> 16:07.829
Maybe I just didn't wanna
know about it at all.

16:08.901 --> 16:11.369
The sick thing is,
he thought I was one too.

16:11.537 --> 16:13.505
You have been known to parade
around the campus

16:13.672 --> 16:14.798
in women's clothing, Steve.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.841
Hey, that was for hell week
and you know it.

16:18.010 --> 16:20.570
Hey, don't be so smug.
He thought you were gay.

16:20.746 --> 16:22.304
But I'm not. So, what's the big deal?

16:22.481 --> 16:24.540
The big deal is,
what do I do about the brothers?

16:24.717 --> 16:25.741
What about them?

16:28.387 --> 16:30.287
Ryan expects me to keep his secret.

16:30.456 --> 16:31.684
So keep it for him.

16:33.625 --> 16:35.217
Don't you think
they have a right to know?

16:35.394 --> 16:37.328
Well, if it hasn't been
a problem so far...

16:37.496 --> 16:39.589
Well, it hasn't been a problem
because no one knows.

16:39.765 --> 16:42.996
You know, Steve,
you have a real short memory.

16:43.168 --> 16:45.796
Do you remember when you almost
got kicked out of the fraternity?

16:45.971 --> 16:48.769
Wasn't Mike Ryan one of the first
brothers to stand up for you?

16:49.575 --> 16:51.736
- Yes.
- So, what are you gonna do?

16:51.910 --> 16:54.435
You gonna call a general meeting?
You gonna make an announcement?

16:54.613 --> 16:56.137
You gonna out him
in front of everybody?

16:56.315 --> 16:58.283
That's a real nice way to repay him.

16:58.450 --> 16:59.474
I wouldn't do that.

16:59.651 --> 17:02.415
- Well, I'm glad to hear it.
- But I will tell you one thing.

17:03.022 --> 17:08.221
He makes one move on me,
one gesture, one look, he'll regret it.

17:16.835 --> 17:20.292
That's it. Let it discover itself.

17:20.472 --> 17:23.406
You've just woken up
after a long night's sleep.

17:23.575 --> 17:25.702
Everything is new.

17:35.154 --> 17:38.089
Well, he's really gotten good,
hasn't he?

17:49.301 --> 17:52.202
- I didn't realize I had an audience.
- That was really great.

17:52.371 --> 17:55.534
Thanks.
It's mostly due to a great teacher.

17:55.707 --> 17:57.675
Don't start getting modest
all of a sudden.

17:58.110 --> 17:59.509
She's trying to teach me arrogance.

17:59.678 --> 18:02.943
She says every great concert pianist
is loaded with it.

18:03.115 --> 18:06.778
And make no mistake about it,
he's coming along beautifully.

18:07.686 --> 18:09.153
I'm Kelly. I'm David's roommate.

18:09.321 --> 18:12.017
Hi. Are you alone?

18:12.191 --> 18:13.590
I thought I heard someone else.

18:15.461 --> 18:18.953
Yeah, you did. I'm Donna.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.160
She's my other roommate.

18:24.603 --> 18:26.002
Hi.

18:26.171 --> 18:29.140
Listen, I'm playing at a recital tonight
on campus.

18:29.308 --> 18:32.209
- Maybe you guys would like to come.
- Yeah, that would be great.

18:33.545 --> 18:35.945
Wait, don't you have
to help set up tonight

18:36.115 --> 18:37.275
for the photo shoot tomorrow?

18:37.449 --> 18:39.644
No, that's not our job.

18:39.818 --> 18:42.685
Actually, I told Leslie I'd stop
by the studio tonight to help out.

18:42.855 --> 18:45.380
- You did? When?
- I must have forgotten to tell you.

18:45.557 --> 18:48.048
Come on, we'd better get back
to campus. We have stuff to do.

18:48.227 --> 18:49.524
Yeah, I'll get my things.

18:49.695 --> 18:51.219
Meet you at the car.

18:51.396 --> 18:53.489
Nice to meet you, Donna.

18:53.999 --> 18:56.490
Yeah, you too.

19:02.341 --> 19:03.865
I kept watching the NCAA's,

19:04.042 --> 19:05.976
wondering which guy on the floor
is me.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.203
Dream on, my brother.

19:07.379 --> 19:09.904
Hey, if I didn't go down,
we had a shot at the tournament.

19:10.082 --> 19:11.447
A very long shot.

19:11.617 --> 19:14.245
Well, all I'm saying is, next March,
when I'm back on my legs,

19:14.419 --> 19:17.183
I'm gonna be
in the middle of the madness.

19:17.356 --> 19:18.380
Hey, Mike. Let's go.

19:18.557 --> 19:21.526
Hey, Brandon, any chance we get
the tall guy out on the court with us?

19:21.693 --> 19:23.957
That wouldn't be fair.
I still got one good leg.

19:24.129 --> 19:25.790
And a very small ego.

19:26.298 --> 19:28.858
Hey, don't worry,
he can't go to his left.

19:29.034 --> 19:30.592
- Thanks a lot, man.
- Good to know.

19:31.036 --> 19:32.901
Take care, D'Shawn.

19:33.805 --> 19:36.103
So I'm gonna make short work
of you, Walsh.

19:36.275 --> 19:38.072
I am due over at Alpha House at 4.

19:38.243 --> 19:40.643
Oh, you got talked into
that stupid calendar thing too, huh?

19:41.346 --> 19:42.813
Guess they caught me
in a weak moment.

19:42.981 --> 19:45.074
- We can go over there together then.
- Good.

19:45.484 --> 19:48.749
So, did Sanders finally get himself
off the B-list?

19:49.621 --> 19:52.055
- I do believe so, yeah.
- Good.

19:52.424 --> 19:55.587
I figure that's why
he's been so moody lately.

19:55.761 --> 19:57.661
Well, Steve's had a lot on his mind.

20:01.433 --> 20:03.298
He told you, didn't he?

20:03.902 --> 20:06.370
Yeah, he did.

20:06.538 --> 20:08.335
But I'm his best friend.

20:10.342 --> 20:13.573
Listen, Mike, I really don't think
you have anything to worry about.

20:13.745 --> 20:15.940
Steve takes his fraternity
very seriously.

20:16.114 --> 20:19.174
And the last thing he wants to do
is violate another brother's trust.

20:22.821 --> 20:24.254
Yeah. Well, I hope you're right.

20:25.290 --> 20:26.723
Let's go.

20:28.393 --> 20:31.123
D'Shawn,
I have been looking all over for you.

20:31.296 --> 20:32.957
Girl, you are relentless.

20:33.131 --> 20:35.031
Look, I'll make you a deal.
If you agree to pose,

20:35.200 --> 20:36.462
I will stop bugging you.

20:36.635 --> 20:39.069
How about I don't agree
and you still stop bugging me?

20:39.238 --> 20:40.933
Look, I don't know
why you don't wanna pose.

20:41.106 --> 20:43.267
You'll look better in the boxers
than anyone else there.

20:43.442 --> 20:44.670
Oh, is that so?

20:44.843 --> 20:46.435
Of course it is.

20:47.212 --> 20:49.772
Well, maybe I'll do it,
but on one condition.

20:49.948 --> 20:51.142
Great. What's that?

20:51.550 --> 20:53.950
- You go out with me.
- Go out with you?

20:54.119 --> 20:56.110
D'Shawn, you know
I already have a boyfriend.

20:57.055 --> 20:58.682
I was just kidding.

20:58.857 --> 21:01.849
I'll pose for your calendar.
You don't have to go out with me.

21:02.027 --> 21:05.895
No, wait a minute.
I think we should go out.

21:06.531 --> 21:10.433
In fact,
I think we should go out tonight.

21:12.004 --> 21:13.562
Wait, wait,
what about your boyfriend?

21:13.739 --> 21:15.798
I'll tell you about it
on the way to Alpha house.

21:15.974 --> 21:17.669
Come on,
we have to go pick you an outfit.

21:17.843 --> 21:19.572
Now?

21:20.012 --> 21:21.479
Lt'll only take ten minutes.

21:23.148 --> 21:26.174
And don't look at me that way.
Remember, I'm relentless.

21:27.386 --> 21:28.614
Very nice.

21:28.787 --> 21:30.584
These are really tasty, Artie.

21:30.756 --> 21:32.883
Did your mom pick yours out?

21:33.358 --> 21:35.258
- Those are silk.
- I like those, man. I think...

21:35.427 --> 21:38.021
- No, the teddy bears will work too.
- Thank you.

21:38.196 --> 21:40.164
So tell us the truth, Sanders.

21:40.332 --> 21:42.493
What'd you have to promise Leslie
to get off the B-list?

21:42.668 --> 21:46.160
Artie, give me a break.
Does this look like a B-list body to you?

21:46.338 --> 21:47.635
Yeah, you're right.

21:47.806 --> 21:50.536
<i>You look like the poster boy
for Queer Nation.</i>

21:53.912 --> 21:55.072
What's that supposed to mean?

21:55.247 --> 21:58.182
It means you chose a pretty stunning
looking pair of shorts, Butchy.

21:59.084 --> 22:00.574
Where'd you try them on,
in the closet?

22:02.187 --> 22:04.348
For your information,
I didn't choose these.

22:04.523 --> 22:05.615
They were given to me.

22:06.224 --> 22:07.248
He's very sensitive.

22:09.828 --> 22:11.796
Give it a rest, Artie.

22:18.403 --> 22:20.234
Oh, now those are fabulous.

22:20.639 --> 22:22.937
Doesn't she look fruity?

22:23.108 --> 22:25.372
Artie, if you're so busy
looking for fruits,

22:25.544 --> 22:27.671
why don't you look at a market
a little closer to home?

22:27.846 --> 22:29.541
Are you calling me a pervert?

22:29.715 --> 22:31.683
I'm not talking about you.

22:31.850 --> 22:34.284
Well, then who
are you talking about?

22:36.121 --> 22:38.988
So tell me something, Walsh.
How come you kept going to your left?

22:39.157 --> 22:42.388
I psyched you out, didn't I?
D'Shawn and I do that all the time.

22:42.561 --> 22:44.552
Yeah, that's the last time
I ever listen to Hardell.

22:44.730 --> 22:47.096
Take your boxer shorts
and find another pinup.

22:47.265 --> 22:49.096
Oh, come on, you guys,
don't do this to me.

22:49.267 --> 22:50.325
What's the matter?

22:50.502 --> 22:53.994
You know damn well
what's the matter. You make me sick.

22:55.474 --> 22:59.103
Mike, Artie found out.

22:59.277 --> 23:02.576
- How'd that happen?
- Well, you know how Artie is.

23:03.882 --> 23:06.282
- It kind of slipped out.
- What do you mean it slipped out?

23:06.451 --> 23:07.941
I thought you said I could trust him.

23:08.120 --> 23:09.610
Come on, man,
it's your own damn fault.

23:09.788 --> 23:12.518
You've been lying to everyone.
Why are you in the closet, anyway?

23:12.691 --> 23:14.056
Because of bigots like you.

23:16.795 --> 23:19.195
Thanks. Thanks for ruining my life.

23:31.042 --> 23:33.602
Now, Steve,
I know you didn't do this on purpose.

23:33.779 --> 23:35.713
There's gotta be
some kind of explanation.

23:35.881 --> 23:38.111
- It just happened.
- What do you mean it just happened?

23:38.283 --> 23:40.114
You promised me
you weren't gonna say anything.

23:40.285 --> 23:44.119
Listen, man. You weren't there, okay?
You don't know what was going on.

23:44.289 --> 23:46.917
I don't like being mistaken
for being gay.

23:47.092 --> 23:51.028
Steve, I really don't think that anybody
is doubting your heterosexuality.

23:51.196 --> 23:52.788
Oh, yeah? Well, Ryan did.

23:52.964 --> 23:55.159
Everyone else
in that coffeehouse did.

23:55.333 --> 23:57.028
Steve, that's weak.

23:57.202 --> 24:00.330
Great, so now your masculinity
is secured for another 24 hours

24:00.505 --> 24:01.631
and we don't have a calendar.

24:01.807 --> 24:03.274
Well, I'm sorry about that, okay?

24:03.442 --> 24:04.500
Steve, I just don't get it.

24:04.676 --> 24:06.143
When did you become
so homophobic?

24:06.311 --> 24:08.711
I am not ho...

24:09.748 --> 24:12.114
You guys, I am not homophobic.

24:12.284 --> 24:15.117
No, you just don't
want to know them

24:15.287 --> 24:16.914
or have anything
to do with them, right?

24:18.223 --> 24:22.455
Look, I'll go back to the KEG house
to smooth things over for you, okay?

24:23.495 --> 24:24.894
Yeah.

24:25.130 --> 24:28.031
I'll check with the guys and make sure
they're still okay with everything.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.497
I'll talk to D'Shawn for you.

24:29.668 --> 24:32.831
No, I'll talk to D'Shawn,
since I'm going out with him tonight.

24:33.438 --> 24:35.235
You are?

24:40.445 --> 24:44.074
David, will you get the door, please?
I'm still getting dressed.

24:50.188 --> 24:52.713
- D'Shawn?
- Hi, how are you doing?

24:53.191 --> 24:54.249
Is Donna ready?

24:57.596 --> 24:59.928
Oh, yeah, that's right.
You're doing the calendar thing.

25:00.098 --> 25:02.566
- Yeah, sure, come on in.
- Yeah.

25:05.170 --> 25:07.434
Hey, it's really cool of you
to help Donna set up tonight.

25:07.606 --> 25:09.665
No, I'm taking her out.

25:12.010 --> 25:13.773
Hi.

25:15.580 --> 25:19.778
Oh, D'Shawn, they're beautiful.

25:19.951 --> 25:21.782
I'm glad you like them.

25:21.953 --> 25:25.480
Oh, D'Shawn,
you know David, my roommate?

25:29.728 --> 25:31.457
Donna, what are you doing?

25:31.630 --> 25:32.722
Will you put these in water?

25:32.898 --> 25:35.731
D'Shawn and I really have to get going.
Enjoy the recital.

25:46.811 --> 25:49.143
- You were great.
- Look who's talking.

25:49.314 --> 25:52.283
Wait, wait.
Did you see the look on his face?

25:58.089 --> 26:00.250
Well, thanks a lot.

26:00.425 --> 26:02.222
I don't wanna take up
any more of your time.

26:02.694 --> 26:04.161
That's what time's for, right?

26:04.996 --> 26:07.726
On a Friday night,
a guy like you must have big plans.

26:07.899 --> 26:09.867
Yeah, I do.

26:10.035 --> 26:12.503
Well, how much do I owe you
for the flowers?

26:12.904 --> 26:15.702
You don't owe me for the flowers.
What you owe me is a date.

26:16.374 --> 26:17.841
I thought you were just kidding.

26:18.510 --> 26:19.738
What kind of bowler are you?

26:19.911 --> 26:21.640
Bowler?

26:22.414 --> 26:27.010
Well, I am a great bowler.
But not in this dress.

26:27.185 --> 26:30.416
Hey, you got a tight dress,
I got a bad knee. We're even.

26:31.389 --> 26:35.120
Okay.
You ever been to Osaka Lanes?

26:35.293 --> 26:36.726
Can't say I have.

26:36.895 --> 26:38.294
- You're gonna love it.
- All right.

26:38.463 --> 26:41.432
It's downtown, Little Tokyo,
wait till you see it.

26:44.569 --> 26:47.868
- No way. No way.
- Hit his face.

26:48.039 --> 26:50.974
- Take that, Artie.
- No, no, you take this.

26:51.810 --> 26:53.505
Hey, Sanders. What's up?

26:53.678 --> 26:55.578
I need to talk to you.

26:55.747 --> 26:57.715
Can't you see I'm busy
whipping Keith's ass here?

26:58.550 --> 27:01.747
- Yeah, right, Artie. In your dreams.
- Well, this is important.

27:01.920 --> 27:03.182
No, this is important.

27:04.022 --> 27:05.250
It's about the calendar, Artie.

27:05.423 --> 27:07.653
Everything's okay.
I just talked to Leslie on the phone.

27:08.193 --> 27:09.592
So you and Ryan worked things out?

27:12.964 --> 27:14.955
Why don't you go ask him yourself?

27:35.854 --> 27:37.617
What are you doing?

27:38.390 --> 27:39.618
What's it look like I'm doing?

27:40.692 --> 27:42.421
Come on, Mike, it's a stupid prank.

27:42.594 --> 27:44.892
I'm sure the guys didn't really
mean anything by it anyway.

27:45.063 --> 27:46.690
Yeah, right.

27:49.901 --> 27:52.028
I am so sorry.

27:52.203 --> 27:54.603
I wasn't thinking and I panicked.

27:55.907 --> 27:57.738
I'd never do anything
to hurt you, bro.

27:58.777 --> 28:01.337
And I did, and I'm sorry.

28:01.846 --> 28:03.780
I always thought of you as my friend.

28:04.916 --> 28:07.680
I hope you realize how much
I appreciate everything you did for me.

28:08.887 --> 28:12.618
Yeah, well, the next time,
don't show so much appreciation.

28:13.992 --> 28:15.619
Come on,
it was just a few of the guys.

28:15.794 --> 28:19.059
I'm sure this is all gonna blow over
in a couple days.

28:20.298 --> 28:24.166
You still don't get it, do you?
Artie called for a membership meeting.

28:24.335 --> 28:27.031
So what?
You're the president of this fraternity.

28:27.205 --> 28:29.901
You're the best president we've had.
I heard guys talking about that.

28:30.075 --> 28:31.975
Me being president isn't the issue.

28:32.143 --> 28:34.373
They wanna kick me
out of the fraternity.

28:34.546 --> 28:35.843
They can't do that.

28:36.014 --> 28:39.177
Yeah, well, don't worry about it,
because they're not gonna have to.

28:40.051 --> 28:42.611
I'm handing in my resignation.

28:42.787 --> 28:43.845
Wait a second.

28:44.022 --> 28:46.354
Will you just let me get out of here?

28:46.658 --> 28:47.682
Where are you gonna go?

28:50.195 --> 28:54.632
Somewhere where I don't have
to apologize for being who I am.

29:18.556 --> 29:20.148
David?

29:20.792 --> 29:23.488
Yeah. How'd you know it was me?

29:23.661 --> 29:25.322
I smelled your cologne.

29:25.497 --> 29:26.964
Maybe I should lighten up on it then.

29:27.132 --> 29:28.258
Maybe not.

29:28.433 --> 29:30.162
I wouldn't want you
sneaking up on me.

29:32.437 --> 29:33.927
Listen, I just wanted
to come back here

29:34.105 --> 29:35.402
and see you before you went out.

29:35.573 --> 29:38.303
- I'm really looking forward to this.
- I'm glad one of us is.

29:38.476 --> 29:39.704
I am so nervous.

29:39.878 --> 29:42.608
What do you have to be nervous
about? You're gonna be brilliant.

29:42.781 --> 29:47.241
Try telling that to my hands.
Look at them, they can't stop shaking.

29:49.454 --> 29:51.547
All right, lefty, we're counting on you.

29:51.723 --> 29:53.190
I know you can do it.

29:53.358 --> 29:56.850
And you too, righty, but remember,
the most important thing:

29:57.028 --> 30:00.794
Always make sure lefty knows
exactly what you're doing.

30:00.965 --> 30:02.762
And you too, lefty.

30:02.934 --> 30:04.834
I'm glad you're here.

30:06.037 --> 30:08.130
Yeah, me too.

30:19.284 --> 30:21.878
It's too bad your friends
couldn't come with us.

30:22.053 --> 30:23.850
Actually, I'm kind of glad they didn't.

30:24.789 --> 30:27.724
Here we go.
Two peach pies right out of the oven

30:27.892 --> 30:30.292
and two cups of coffee.

30:30.461 --> 30:33.692
Now, if you need anything else,
you let me know, okay?

30:33.865 --> 30:36.390
- Thank you, Nat. I will.
- Okay, pal.

30:36.968 --> 30:41.598
You were right about the pie.
It does smell like a slice of heaven.

30:41.773 --> 30:43.741
Is there any cream on the table?

30:43.908 --> 30:45.170
Oh, yeah. It's over there.

30:45.944 --> 30:47.536
Where is "over there"?

30:49.247 --> 30:51.715
- Sorry, I'll get it.
- No.

30:52.383 --> 30:54.715
Imagine my plate is a clock.

30:54.886 --> 31:01.257
This is 12:00, 3:00, 6:00 and 9:00.

31:01.426 --> 31:03.326
Now, where is the cream?

31:04.863 --> 31:05.955
Ten o'clock.

31:14.439 --> 31:16.100
Your hands are so beautiful.

31:17.976 --> 31:20.809
You know, sometimes when you're
playing, I can't help but look at them.

31:21.479 --> 31:22.503
David...

31:22.680 --> 31:26.116
Tonight at the recital,
I really felt a connection.

31:26.918 --> 31:28.886
Almost as if you were playing for me.

31:29.988 --> 31:33.446
Music can be
a pretty heady experience.

31:33.625 --> 31:36.321
Sometimes it brings up emotions
that aren't really there.

31:37.495 --> 31:38.792
What are you saying?

31:38.963 --> 31:42.296
David, you're not in love with me.
You're in love with my music.

31:42.800 --> 31:46.566
No, it's more than just that.
I admire how brave you are.

31:46.738 --> 31:48.729
I mean, most people
in your situation would give up,

31:48.907 --> 31:50.636
but you don't let it stop you.

31:50.808 --> 31:53.242
I just wanna make
your life easier for you.

31:53.411 --> 31:56.471
I'm not a fairytale princess
who needs to be rescued.

31:57.649 --> 31:59.776
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that way.

32:00.752 --> 32:04.483
You know, you really hurt
your girlfriend's feelings this afternoon.

32:04.856 --> 32:06.016
My girlfriend?

32:06.190 --> 32:10.058
Donna.
She is your girlfriend, isn't she?

32:12.530 --> 32:13.656
How'd you know that?

32:13.831 --> 32:16.925
David, I'm blind, not deaf.

32:17.468 --> 32:18.935
Didn't you hear the hurt in her voice

32:19.103 --> 32:21.162
when you didn't wanna be with her
tonight?

32:25.009 --> 32:26.237
Do you love her?

32:27.512 --> 32:31.004
We've been together for a long time
and we've been through a lot.

32:31.182 --> 32:35.050
Is that a yes or a no?
An artist has to know his own heart.

32:38.423 --> 32:41.358
Yeah. Yeah, I love her.

32:42.293 --> 32:45.592
Then maybe you ought to save
the sweet talk for her.

32:53.771 --> 32:56.865
As long as I live in L.A.,
I don't think I'll ever get used to it.

32:57.542 --> 32:59.100
The Osaka Lanes.

32:59.277 --> 33:01.142
Now, there's something
you'd never see in Texas.

33:01.312 --> 33:05.214
Cocktail waitresses serving sushi
and a DJ playing hip-hop.

33:05.383 --> 33:07.112
But you had a good time, right?

33:07.285 --> 33:09.685
All except for you whipping my butt.

33:13.758 --> 33:16.625
So David's not back from the recital.

33:18.296 --> 33:21.129
Holly's probably on her tenth encore
by now.

33:21.299 --> 33:23.062
David's probably
leading the applause.

33:25.837 --> 33:28.897
You know, when I was growing up,

33:29.073 --> 33:31.906
it seems like all I did
was play basketball.

33:32.076 --> 33:35.341
That was my number one reason
for living, you know what I mean?

33:35.513 --> 33:37.344
Well, sure.
That's how you got so good at it.

33:38.316 --> 33:39.749
Right.

33:40.885 --> 33:44.116
But more than a few girls
didn't quite see it that way.

33:45.223 --> 33:49.057
We'd go out to a movie,
I'd run into one of my buddies

33:49.227 --> 33:52.162
and we'd start talking
about the game that afternoon.

33:52.330 --> 33:54.059
Before I knew it,
I'd be getting one of those

33:54.232 --> 33:56.564
don't-you-think-it's-time-we-left
looks.

33:57.068 --> 33:59.036
I always knew
that was the end of the date.

34:01.239 --> 34:03.332
They just felt excluded.

34:03.508 --> 34:04.873
Well, what was I supposed to do?

34:05.043 --> 34:07.637
Not talk about the thing
I loved the most?

34:07.812 --> 34:11.976
What those girls didn't understand
was that my passion for basketball

34:12.150 --> 34:13.947
had nothing to do
with my passion for them.

34:17.221 --> 34:18.415
So, what are you saying?

34:18.589 --> 34:21.284
That I shouldn't care that David
has a crush on his piano teacher?

34:22.226 --> 34:24.820
Hey, I'm just talking about me.

34:37.641 --> 34:41.668
You know what?
I'm really glad that we became friends.

34:41.846 --> 34:43.473
Me too.

34:43.648 --> 34:45.911
Let's do this again. Soon.

34:46.083 --> 34:47.813
Okay.

35:24.622 --> 35:26.021
Do you guys mind if I join you?

35:28.893 --> 35:30.827
Do whatever you want.

35:33.498 --> 35:35.329
I'll see you later.

35:40.004 --> 35:43.633
So, what's the problem?

35:44.041 --> 35:45.338
More car trouble?

35:45.910 --> 35:48.811
Mike, I was hoping I'd find you here.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.538
Haven't you done
enough damage already?

35:50.715 --> 35:52.580
I didn't come to do
any more damage, okay?

35:52.750 --> 35:53.978
I just wanted to talk to you.

35:55.653 --> 35:57.280
I think my friend Gary
had the right idea.

35:57.455 --> 35:59.923
Just cut your losses and run.

36:00.591 --> 36:03.754
There's nothing worse than
having somebody say, "I told you so. "

36:04.829 --> 36:06.057
You mean about the fraternity?

36:08.866 --> 36:12.461
Gary always accused me
of wanting to have it both ways.

36:12.637 --> 36:13.831
Of course, I always accused him

36:14.005 --> 36:16.132
of being afraid
to venture outside of Boys Town, so.

36:17.341 --> 36:20.105
This Gary,
he's a good friend of yours?

36:22.013 --> 36:23.776
What, did I say something wrong?

36:25.683 --> 36:28.982
For a few months,
Gary was my boyfriend.

36:29.954 --> 36:32.218
He's the first one I ever had.

36:32.823 --> 36:34.757
That is, till he got fed up with me.

36:35.293 --> 36:36.317
What happened?

36:38.262 --> 36:40.890
I never wanted us to do anything.

36:41.432 --> 36:44.401
I was always afraid
if we went somewhere,

36:44.569 --> 36:46.002
I might run into someone.

36:48.906 --> 36:50.203
I know what that's like.

36:51.943 --> 36:52.967
Oh, you do, huh?

36:54.679 --> 36:56.112
Well, not exactly.

36:56.280 --> 36:58.680
But I had this girlfriend, Celeste.

36:59.483 --> 37:03.681
And I really screwed that up.

37:03.854 --> 37:06.379
Did you keep her separate
from the rest of your life?

37:08.593 --> 37:09.992
That was a big part of it.

37:12.697 --> 37:16.997
Well, there you go, I guess
we're more alike than we realized.

37:19.303 --> 37:22.101
Mike, I really wish
you'd come back to the house.

37:23.608 --> 37:27.203
Back into enemy territory.
I don't think so.

37:27.378 --> 37:30.245
Don't you at least owe it to yourself
to stand up to these guys?

37:30.414 --> 37:34.009
- What? One man against a mob?
- No, not one man.

37:34.719 --> 37:36.414
I'll stand there with you.

37:44.295 --> 37:46.263
Forget about our reputation
on campus.

37:46.664 --> 37:50.725
No, from now on, whenever
they refer to us as a jock house,

37:50.901 --> 37:52.528
it's gonna have
a whole new meaning.

37:54.138 --> 37:55.571
No.

37:56.040 --> 37:59.066
I say you guys
gotta think about the future.

37:59.243 --> 38:01.507
What kind of pledges
are we gonna attract?

38:01.679 --> 38:04.978
Who's gonna show up
to join a gay fraternity?

38:05.850 --> 38:06.976
And what about our alumni?

38:07.151 --> 38:09.312
We can't survive
without their donations.

38:09.487 --> 38:10.920
What's gonna happen
when they realize

38:11.088 --> 38:12.715
what this fraternity's turned into?

38:13.824 --> 38:16.054
I think the choice before us
is pretty clear.

38:16.794 --> 38:19.592
The motion's been made
and seconded.

38:19.764 --> 38:21.095
I say it's time for a vote.

38:21.265 --> 38:22.698
Wait just a second, Artie.

38:23.934 --> 38:26.061
This deserves more discussion.

38:26.237 --> 38:27.932
Doesn't Mike
get a chance to defend himself?

38:28.472 --> 38:30.372
Since when have you and Ryan
gotten so chummy?

38:30.541 --> 38:33.510
Let him speak, Artie.
We have to hear both sides.

38:35.079 --> 38:36.569
Anybody have any objections?

38:41.719 --> 38:43.118
Okay, Ryan.

38:43.487 --> 38:45.614
The floor is yours.

39:01.138 --> 39:03.936
When I first came here today,

39:04.775 --> 39:09.769
I thought I was gonna apologize
for being so dishonest with you guys.

39:10.514 --> 39:15.110
See, I didn't think
that I could trust you to see

39:15.286 --> 39:19.780
that I am still the same person
I've always been.

39:20.524 --> 39:21.923
The man you elected president.

39:23.461 --> 39:25.395
Then I started thinking
about some of the brothers

39:25.563 --> 39:27.963
and the history of this fraternity.

39:28.933 --> 39:31.663
And I realized
I was selling you guys short.

39:33.404 --> 39:36.805
I thought about
the first African-American pledge

39:36.974 --> 39:39.670
that dared to challenge
this fraternity's color line.

39:39.844 --> 39:41.607
And now we take it for granted.

39:41.779 --> 39:43.679
I thought about
the first Hispanic brother.

39:43.848 --> 39:45.713
And I thought about
the first Jewish brother

39:45.883 --> 39:48.351
and the first Asian-American brother.

39:49.186 --> 39:53.885
And then I realized that the problem
isn't really about me being gay.

39:55.626 --> 40:00.325
The problem is about people
being afraid of what they don't know.

40:00.498 --> 40:01.829
Yeah, well, what I wanna know is,

40:01.999 --> 40:04.229
how can you compare yourself
to them?

40:04.402 --> 40:07.860
You're talking about race.
I'm talking about sex.

40:08.038 --> 40:09.733
Sex with another guy.

40:10.541 --> 40:11.906
You're wrong, Artie.

40:12.076 --> 40:15.170
This isn't about race
and it isn't about sex.

40:16.914 --> 40:18.381
It's about brotherhood.

40:19.216 --> 40:21.343
About loyalty.

40:21.519 --> 40:24.249
Something you guys
pay a lot of lip service to.

40:25.256 --> 40:27.190
Is that all it is, lip service?

40:27.358 --> 40:30.885
A slogan on a plaque?
A secret handshake?

40:31.362 --> 40:34.456
Is that what we're talking about here?
Because if it is,

40:34.632 --> 40:37.328
then this fraternity
and everything it stands for is a joke.

40:42.573 --> 40:45.736
I move that we allow Mike Ryan
to remain a fraternity brother.

40:47.311 --> 40:49.370
I move we also keep him
as president.

41:04.662 --> 41:06.061
I second it.

41:06.430 --> 41:08.159
Yeah, Keith.

41:19.844 --> 41:23.575
If that's what you guys want,
you can have it.

41:23.948 --> 41:25.745
Oh, Artie, man.

41:27.418 --> 41:29.613
I'll be damned
if I'm gonna watch this place fall apart.

41:29.787 --> 41:33.120
It's not gonna fall apart, Artie.
It just isn't, man.

42:08.459 --> 42:10.359
This is a real hoot, isn't it?

42:10.528 --> 42:12.325
I don't know
why this is taking so long.

42:12.496 --> 42:13.758
What, the photo shoot?

42:13.931 --> 42:15.364
No, the microwave.

42:20.337 --> 42:21.804
I know, I know.

42:21.972 --> 42:24.463
I have to stop eating so much, but...

42:24.642 --> 42:26.337
Soon.

42:27.378 --> 42:30.074
Well, Brandon, I can see here
that they finally found

42:30.247 --> 42:32.511
the right boxers for you.
Kelly told me they would.

42:32.683 --> 42:34.776
Is that the only reason you're here,
to bust my chops?

42:34.952 --> 42:37.853
It's so easy. It's the best way to keep
those chops in pristine condition.

42:38.022 --> 42:40.490
Besides, the girls of CU
are counting on it.

42:40.658 --> 42:42.489
Thank you, sir.

42:45.763 --> 42:48.493
What do you think, Silver?
Too perfect or what?

42:50.167 --> 42:52.761
Yeah, Steve, too perfect.

42:52.937 --> 42:54.734
I hear you whipped Brandon
pretty good.

42:54.905 --> 42:56.497
You know he's got no jump shot,
don't you?

42:56.674 --> 43:00.166
Oh, yeah,
just like he can't go to his left.

43:01.178 --> 43:04.011
I'd better watch out for you.
You catch on pretty quick.

43:04.181 --> 43:07.150
- Hey, I'm glad you're here.
- Yeah, thanks.

43:11.121 --> 43:13.248
I thought you said
David wasn't coming.

43:13.424 --> 43:14.755
I don't know what got into him.

43:14.925 --> 43:17.018
All of a sudden,
he told me that he loved me

43:17.194 --> 43:19.890
and that he would do anything
to help out.

43:21.465 --> 43:23.956
You know, Artie Devers and
Glenn Williams still aren't here yet.

43:24.134 --> 43:25.829
What are we gonna do?

43:40.351 --> 43:43.286
First up, D'Shawn Hardell.
