WEBVTT

00:04.879 --> 00:07.256
- Okay.
- Come on, no peeking.

00:07.424 --> 00:11.343
Our eyes are closed, and we're about
to cross the street. Very good.

00:11.511 --> 00:13.303
Okay. Open up.

00:17.183 --> 00:22.604
What do you want to show us?
Because all I can see is this bitchen van.

00:24.149 --> 00:25.774
Yeah, it's for our catering business.

00:25.942 --> 00:27.985
- Oh.
- I think I know that girl.

00:30.113 --> 00:33.699
- We're not gonna keep it this way, though.
- No?

00:33.867 --> 00:36.910
We're gonna paint over the sword
and replace it with a baguette.

00:37.078 --> 00:38.746
Oh.

00:38.913 --> 00:42.166
Um, also, we don't know what to do
with this.

00:44.961 --> 00:47.212
Oh, yeah, I definitely know her.

01:38.056 --> 01:41.308
Remember that guy from cooking school
that put cilantro in everything?

01:41.476 --> 01:43.310
- Oh, sure, Cilantro Larry.
- Yeah.

01:44.145 --> 01:47.606
Well, I'm gonna fill in for him as food critic
for the Chelsea Reporter.

01:47.774 --> 01:52.611
Wow. Monica, what an amazing opportunity
to influence...

01:52.779 --> 01:54.321
...dozens of people.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.159
What about our catering business?

01:59.327 --> 02:01.161
Oh, no, no, it's just one night a week.

02:01.329 --> 02:03.956
Plus, I get to take all of you out
for free dinners.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.290
- Hey.
- Oh.

02:05.458 --> 02:06.542
Well, in that case:

02:10.672 --> 02:13.006
- That was me hopping on board.
- Oh.

02:13.883 --> 02:18.011
Hey, guys. Hey, Ross.
Quick question for you.

02:18.179 --> 02:19.680
Are you ready to party?

02:20.932 --> 02:23.559
I don't know, I could maybe go out
for a couple of beers.

02:23.726 --> 02:27.855
But there's this thing about bumblebees
on the Discovery Channel.

02:28.940 --> 02:33.235
No, no, no, I don't think you heard me.
Are you ready to party?

02:34.737 --> 02:36.530
No.

02:36.698 --> 02:38.866
Gandalf? Gandalf is coming to town?

02:39.033 --> 02:41.160
Kathy's with her parents,
I have nothing to do.

02:41.327 --> 02:43.704
Tomorrow we are partying
with Gandalf, dude.

02:44.247 --> 02:48.625
Dude, we are so gonna party. Yeah.

02:48.793 --> 02:50.669
Wow, okay. Dude alert.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.173
And who is this guy?

02:54.340 --> 02:58.594
Mike "Gandalf" Ganderson.
Only, like, the funnest guy in the world.

02:58.761 --> 03:00.387
I'm gonna call
and get off work tomorrow.

03:00.555 --> 03:03.724
Oh. I'm gonna call after you.

03:03.892 --> 03:06.852
This is gonna be so cool.
Dude, we never party anymore.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.271
Whoo!

03:09.772 --> 03:13.275
All right, were you guys
smoking something in the back of our van?

03:14.402 --> 03:17.613
What do you mean, we never have fun?
You have fun with me.

03:17.780 --> 03:21.909
Remember the time we saw those strippers
and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?

03:23.536 --> 03:28.207
Joey, you are gonna love this guy.
Gandalf is like the party wizard.

03:28.374 --> 03:32.002
- Well, why do you call him Gandalf?
- Gandalf the wizard.

03:34.088 --> 03:36.715
Hello? Didn't you read
Lord of the Rings in high school?

03:38.343 --> 03:39.760
No, I had sex in high school.

03:46.434 --> 03:50.520
Oh. Uh, Joanna? I was wondering
if I could ask you something.

03:50.688 --> 03:53.398
There's an opening for an assistant buyer
in Junior Miss...

03:53.566 --> 03:55.609
Okay, but that would be a step down
for me.

03:55.777 --> 03:58.237
No, actually, I meant for me.

03:58.821 --> 04:00.948
The hiring committee
is meeting people all day and...

04:01.115 --> 04:06.119
Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but I guess
you can't stay my assistant forever.

04:06.287 --> 04:09.206
Neither can you, Sophie,
but for different reasons.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.126
I'm so glad
you don't have a problem with this.

04:13.294 --> 04:15.629
If you did,
I wouldn't have considered applying.

04:15.797 --> 04:16.838
Really? In that case...

04:17.005 --> 04:19.216
And that's why I'm so glad
there's no problem.

04:19.841 --> 04:23.845
Yeah, it's fine. I'm on the hiring committee,
so there'll be one friendly face.

04:24.013 --> 04:25.430
Oh, that's great.

04:25.598 --> 04:28.183
- You know, Junior Miss is where I started.
- Really?

04:28.351 --> 04:31.603
I had to sleep with the ugliest guy
to get that job.

04:32.689 --> 04:36.233
- Really?
- No. Ha, ha.

04:36.401 --> 04:37.985
Yeah.

04:38.987 --> 04:41.697
- I mean, no. No, no, no. Ha, ha.
- No. Ha, ha.

04:41.864 --> 04:45.200
I'm sure with your qualifications,
you won't need to sleep with some guy.

04:45.368 --> 04:46.410
Oh. Ha, ha.

04:46.577 --> 04:48.704
Although, uh,
I might need some convincing.

04:50.873 --> 04:52.916
- Um... Oh.
- Kidding. Ha, ha.

04:55.503 --> 04:57.254
- God, I feel wild today.
- Aah!

05:02.343 --> 05:05.679
Oh, man, I am so excited, I may vomit.

05:07.015 --> 05:10.600
Will you calm down?
He's just a human guy.

05:11.102 --> 05:13.562
Look, you don't understand.
Gandalf is amazing.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.355
You never know what's gonna happen.

05:15.523 --> 05:19.985
You go out for a couple of beers and
end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.779
- Really?
- Oh, yeah, it's beautiful country up there.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.198
Hey. Okay.

05:25.366 --> 05:30.203
I got my passport, fresh socks,
and a snakebite kit.

05:30.913 --> 05:33.040
It's not gonna be exactly like last time.

05:34.876 --> 05:36.043
All right, I'll see you guys.

05:36.210 --> 05:38.837
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.882
I have an audition,
but I'll hook up with you later.

05:42.050 --> 05:43.884
- Where you gonna be around noon?
- Heh.

05:44.052 --> 05:46.178
Somewhere maybe along the equator?

05:48.431 --> 05:49.848
Okay.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.643
Hello?

05:53.811 --> 05:54.978
It's Gandalf.

05:57.899 --> 05:59.775
So are you in town?

06:01.903 --> 06:03.445
Oh, well...

06:04.030 --> 06:06.073
Well, maybe next time, then.

06:06.949 --> 06:08.033
What happened?

06:08.201 --> 06:10.285
He's not gonna make it.
He's stuck in Chicago.

06:10.453 --> 06:11.787
Oh, man.

06:11.954 --> 06:14.623
Chicago's so lucky.

06:15.333 --> 06:19.294
Stupid, useless Canadian money.

06:24.842 --> 06:27.803
You have a very impressive résumé,
Ms. Green.

06:27.970 --> 06:32.307
I especially like what I see here
about implementing a new filing system.

06:32.475 --> 06:33.975
Thank you.

06:34.143 --> 06:38.105
Filing system? Oh, you mean those little
colored labels you put on all the folders?

06:38.272 --> 06:41.650
It certainly did brighten up
the inside of the filing cabinets.

06:42.485 --> 06:46.279
Well, they, uh... They did more than that.

06:46.447 --> 06:50.492
I notice that you've been entrusted
with a lot of important responsibilities.

06:50.660 --> 06:55.163
Yes. Joanna really has been
an incredible mentor to me.

06:55.331 --> 06:59.126
Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible
at getting my morning bagel.

06:59.293 --> 07:01.920
It's amazing how she gets it right
almost every time.

07:03.423 --> 07:06.383
Of course,
I have more responsibilities than that.

07:06.551 --> 07:12.139
Oh, yes, of course. There's the coffee too.
Rachel can carry two things at once.

07:13.182 --> 07:15.642
That's, uh, very good.

07:16.310 --> 07:18.854
Now, a big part of this job...

07:19.021 --> 07:22.941
...is cultivating personal relationships,
especially with designers.

07:23.109 --> 07:25.652
- Yes, I realize...
- Rachel shouldn't have any problem.

07:25.820 --> 07:29.531
Her only problem might be getting a little
too friendly, if you know what I mean.

07:30.658 --> 07:32.409
I love working with designers.

07:32.577 --> 07:35.704
With them, under them,
what's the difference, eh, Rach?

07:41.627 --> 07:43.628
Hey. My first review is out.

07:43.796 --> 07:46.548
Oh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter.

07:46.716 --> 07:50.010
Ah. These used to keep me so warm.

07:50.678 --> 07:53.054
- All right, look, I'm on the back page.
- Ooh. Oh!

07:53.222 --> 07:57.434
Okay. "Would I go back to Allesandro's?
Sure, but I would have to order two meals.

07:57.602 --> 08:01.188
One for me, and one for the guy
pointing the gun to my head."

08:01.898 --> 08:04.316
Wow, you really laid into this place.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.652
Hey, they don't pay me a penny a word
to make friends.

08:07.820 --> 08:11.323
Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy
who could fix up the van for catering.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.700
- Oh. You want me to go with you?
- No, no, it's okay.

08:13.868 --> 08:16.578
But are we sure
we don't want the waterbed?

08:17.330 --> 08:20.290
- Haven't we made this decision?
- Yeah, all right.

08:22.084 --> 08:23.543
- Bye.
- Bye.

08:29.842 --> 08:30.884
Who is it?

08:31.052 --> 08:33.845
It's Allesandro, from Allesandro's.

08:35.472 --> 08:36.515
Oh, my God.

08:36.682 --> 08:39.934
- I wanna talk to you about your review.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

08:40.102 --> 08:42.312
Call me on the phone.

08:42.938 --> 08:45.357
What, so you can hang up on me?

08:45.525 --> 08:48.276
I'm never gonna let you up,
so you may as well just go away.

08:48.444 --> 08:49.653
Just give me a chance to...

08:49.820 --> 08:52.113
Do you need to get in? Here you go.

08:52.281 --> 08:54.324
- No, Phoebe!
- Oh, hey, Monica.

09:00.665 --> 09:04.543
I want a retraction.
Our food is not "inedible swill."

09:04.710 --> 09:05.752
I couldn't eat it.

09:05.920 --> 09:09.422
I have five friends who couldn't eat it,
and one of them eats books.

09:10.758 --> 09:13.009
Well, our service is not
"grossly incompetent."

09:13.177 --> 09:16.304
The waiter carried the breadsticks
in his pants.

09:17.557 --> 09:21.351
Well, you said that we accept
the Discover Card...

09:21.519 --> 09:23.937
...which we do not.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.815
All right, that I'll retract.

09:26.983 --> 09:30.193
But I stand by my review.
I know food, and that wasn't it.

09:30.653 --> 09:32.737
Your marinara sauce
tastes like tomato juice.

09:32.905 --> 09:35.865
You should serve it with vodka
and a piece of celery.

09:36.033 --> 09:38.368
Hey, I'm proud of that sauce.
It's delicious.

09:38.536 --> 09:39.953
Oh, my God.

09:40.121 --> 09:42.914
You own an Italian restaurant
and you think that tastes good?

09:43.082 --> 09:44.207
Where are you even from?

09:45.918 --> 09:47.752
Lebanon.

09:49.130 --> 09:50.171
Hand me those tomatoes.

09:50.339 --> 09:53.842
I'm gonna show you what it should
taste like. Come on, hand them to me.

09:55.011 --> 09:58.513
How long is this gonna take?
I got another critic I gotta go yell at.

10:04.854 --> 10:07.814
Ahem. Uh, Joanna,
I wanna talk about that interview.

10:07.982 --> 10:10.233
I thought it went very well.

10:11.068 --> 10:15.864
No, it didn't.
That's what I wanna talk to you about.

10:16.782 --> 10:18.992
Now, just to brief you...

10:20.703 --> 10:22.704
...I may cry.

10:23.706 --> 10:27.626
But they are not tears of sadness
or of anger...

10:27.793 --> 10:30.253
...but just of me having this discussion
with you.

10:31.213 --> 10:33.131
Rachel, please, don't make a scene.

10:33.799 --> 10:35.925
There's nobody here.

10:36.093 --> 10:37.927
Sophie, get in here.

10:40.014 --> 10:42.891
You see?
Now you're making Sophie uncomfortable.

10:43.059 --> 10:44.768
She's not making me uncomfortable.

10:44.935 --> 10:49.022
Congratulations, you've just crossed
the line into completely useless. Get out.

10:51.776 --> 10:53.401
Do you want me to quit?

10:53.569 --> 10:55.654
What? What would make you think that?

10:56.739 --> 10:59.157
Well, all of those things you said
in the interview.

10:59.325 --> 11:02.452
If you believe any of them,
I must not be a very good assistant.

11:04.455 --> 11:05.664
You know what?

11:06.165 --> 11:09.584
I am just going to pack up my desk...

11:10.878 --> 11:14.506
...and I will be gone
by the end of the day.

11:17.968 --> 11:21.680
Well, I guess there's no use me
sticking around till the end of the day.

11:22.390 --> 11:23.807
Wait, wait, wait.

11:23.974 --> 11:26.768
You can put your sad little muffin
back in its drawer.

11:27.603 --> 11:32.148
If you must know the truth,
I didn't wanna lose a good assistant.

11:32.483 --> 11:33.525
What?

11:33.693 --> 11:38.363
That's why I said all those things
about your flirting and your drinking.

11:38.948 --> 11:40.198
My drinking?

11:41.617 --> 11:44.244
Oh. I must have said that after you left.

11:45.579 --> 11:46.955
Said what, exactly?

11:47.123 --> 11:48.915
That you enjoy the occasional drink...

11:49.083 --> 11:50.917
...- ing binge.

11:52.211 --> 11:54.796
Oh, my God. Oh. That is it. I'm leaving.

11:54.964 --> 11:58.299
- You are just a horrible person.
- No, wait, wait, wait.

11:58.467 --> 12:01.386
Now, if you're gonna get
all sensitive about it.

12:01.554 --> 12:02.929
I don't want to lose you.

12:03.097 --> 12:05.640
What if I create a position for you?

12:05.808 --> 12:08.810
I'll make you assistant buyer
in this department.

12:10.229 --> 12:12.731
- Say more things like that.
- Um...

12:13.524 --> 12:16.526
You can have your own office and a raise,
effective tomorrow.

12:17.319 --> 12:19.904
- I'd need an expense account.
- Done.

12:20.448 --> 12:22.991
- And an assistant.
- Sophie, get in here.

12:25.327 --> 12:29.247
Now it seems like a lifetime, doesn't it?
Starting from...

12:29.415 --> 12:30.999
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

12:31.167 --> 12:34.836
I thought you'd be partying
with Gandoldorf.

12:35.546 --> 12:38.673
It's Gandalf, and he's not coming.

12:38.841 --> 12:42.177
- So you've been sitting here all morning?
- No.

12:42.344 --> 12:44.846
I balanced my checkbook.

12:45.431 --> 12:48.725
Yeah, and I gave first names
to all the foosball players.

12:50.519 --> 12:53.021
I can't believe he didn't come.

12:53.189 --> 12:56.483
So what if he didn't come?
We can still go out and party ourselves.

12:56.650 --> 13:00.320
Oh, no, you know, with Gandalf,
we'd be out all night.

13:00.488 --> 13:04.741
Yeah, we'd meet total strangers
and hang out with them.

13:04.909 --> 13:06.367
Well, we could do that.

13:07.745 --> 13:10.288
There was other stuff too.

13:10.956 --> 13:12.749
We'll do it all, and better.

13:12.917 --> 13:15.710
Look, after tonight,
Gandalf will wanna party with us, dude.

13:15.878 --> 13:16.920
Come on.

13:17.505 --> 13:19.881
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:20.049 --> 13:23.468
- It's not like we don't know how to party.
- Yeah. All right. Let's go.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.595
And maybe we could end up
on a boat again?

13:25.763 --> 13:27.222
- Yeah!
- All right!

13:27.389 --> 13:28.598
Ah!

13:29.099 --> 13:32.143
Hey, hey, hey. When were we on a boat?

13:32.311 --> 13:34.103
Remember that really cold morning...

13:34.271 --> 13:36.940
...when you woke up
and those dogs were licking your face?

13:37.107 --> 13:38.775
- Yeah.
- Those were seals, man.

13:46.575 --> 13:49.661
Hey, how do you think this suit would look
on an assistant buyer...?

13:49.829 --> 13:51.955
The owner of Allesandro's
came to yell at me...

13:52.122 --> 13:55.333
...but I made him some sauce,
and he offered me the job as head chef.

13:55.501 --> 13:56.543
Oh, my God.

13:56.710 --> 14:00.922
You just ruined the thing I was practicing
the whole way home, but I'm so happy.

14:01.799 --> 14:04.384
Can you believe it?
I finally get to run my own kitchen.

14:04.552 --> 14:05.593
Oh, you've waited so long.

14:05.761 --> 14:07.804
- Ha, ha, oh.
- Oh.

14:07.972 --> 14:10.431
- Hey.
- Hey, Pheebs. Quick question for you.

14:10.599 --> 14:14.978
How do you think this suit would look
on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's?

14:15.145 --> 14:18.940
I don't know. It would totally depend
on her coloring and...

14:19.441 --> 14:20.984
- You got the job!
- Yes!

14:21.151 --> 14:24.028
Oh! You got the job?
Why didn't you tell me?

14:26.657 --> 14:30.326
Oh. It's gonna be so great.
I'm gonna get to help decide what we sell.

14:30.494 --> 14:33.162
I'm gonna have an office
with walls and everything.

14:33.330 --> 14:36.291
- I'm gonna have walls.
- Aw.

14:36.458 --> 14:39.794
Is this the day of good news or what?
I got us a job.

14:39.962 --> 14:41.045
The wedding reception.

14:41.213 --> 14:42.672
Oh.

14:43.632 --> 14:47.135
Um, Phoebe,
I kind of need to talk to you about that.

14:49.638 --> 14:50.805
Um...

14:51.557 --> 14:55.727
Well, I think it might be time for me
to take a step back from the catering.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.646
- But we've only had one job.
- Tsk.

14:58.814 --> 15:03.568
I know, but now we have this second one,
and it just feels like it's snowballing.

15:04.862 --> 15:06.195
Yeah, what are you saying?

15:06.822 --> 15:09.699
I got offered the head-chef job
at Allesandro's.

15:10.117 --> 15:14.370
- What?
- It's okay, you don't really need me.

15:14.872 --> 15:16.915
You're the cook.

15:17.708 --> 15:20.376
Without you,
it's just me driving up to people's houses...

15:20.544 --> 15:22.545
...with empty trays and asking for money.

15:26.508 --> 15:27.508
All right.

15:27.676 --> 15:31.095
But, um, well, I'll pay you back
all the money you invested.

15:31.263 --> 15:34.390
- And you can keep the van.
- For what?

15:36.018 --> 15:39.437
I can't believe this.
I gotta get out of here.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.731
Phoebe, wait a minute.

15:44.985 --> 15:47.362
I'm an assistant buyer!

15:51.867 --> 15:55.411
All right, we'll get a little coffee,
get energized, then we'll head back out.

15:55.579 --> 15:57.872
- Yeah, all right.
- Okay.

16:01.043 --> 16:05.046
So we're having fun, right?
We don't need that wizard guy.

16:05.214 --> 16:08.216
We hit a couple of clubs,
talked to some strangers...

16:08.384 --> 16:11.928
...then after this, we'll go down
to the docks and see about that boat thing.

16:13.931 --> 16:16.182
I'm kind of beat.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.226
Actually...

16:18.394 --> 16:19.894
...me too.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.062
Are you serious?

16:21.230 --> 16:22.271
Yeah.

16:22.439 --> 16:24.190
Thank God. I'm exhausted.

16:26.694 --> 16:27.944
So you guys want coffees?

16:28.112 --> 16:31.280
Yeah, but I don't wanna be up too late,
so I'll have a decaf.

16:31.448 --> 16:33.241
Yeah, me too.

16:33.409 --> 16:36.828
Actually, could I get some hot water
with a little lemon?

16:37.538 --> 16:42.667
I strained my voice screaming in there.
Does it have to be so loud?

16:42.835 --> 16:45.920
Oh. I can't hear a word you're saying,
my ears are ringing so bad.

16:46.088 --> 16:49.674
Huh. I was glad I brought that extra pair
of socks, you know?

16:49.842 --> 16:50.925
I used them as mittens.

16:51.093 --> 16:53.011
I didn't wanna touch a thing
in that last place.

16:53.178 --> 16:54.429
Oh.

16:58.392 --> 17:00.768
How sad are we?

17:00.936 --> 17:02.270
Yeah, I know.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.231
You know what? We're not sad.

17:05.398 --> 17:07.733
We're not sad,
we're just not 21 anymore, you know?

17:07.901 --> 17:09.402
I'm 29 years old, damn it.

17:09.569 --> 17:12.113
I wanna sit in a comfortable chair,
watch television...

17:12.281 --> 17:14.115
...and go to sleep at a reasonable hour.

17:14.282 --> 17:15.450
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:15.617 --> 17:19.287
Yeah, and I like to hang out in a quiet place
where I can talk to my friends.

17:19.454 --> 17:20.496
Yeah.

17:20.664 --> 17:25.501
And so what if I like to go home,
throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath?

17:29.256 --> 17:30.798
We're 29. We're not women.

17:38.599 --> 17:41.684
Oh. There you are.

17:42.102 --> 17:44.937
Hey, I'm glad that you decided
to hear me out.

17:45.105 --> 17:47.190
Okay, I'm hearing.

17:47.858 --> 17:50.026
I've been doing a lot of thinking. A lot.

17:50.486 --> 17:55.198
And, well, I came up with a whole bunch of
businesses that you can do with your van.

17:55.365 --> 17:56.866
Okay, um...

17:57.409 --> 18:00.620
- You could be a flower delivery person.
- What?

18:00.788 --> 18:02.914
Or a bakery delivery person.

18:04.291 --> 18:05.333
Pizza?

18:06.043 --> 18:07.919
Monica.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.838
All right, I got a whole bunch of stuff
in this area...

18:11.006 --> 18:13.716
...but I'm getting the feeling
you don't wanna deliver.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.929
- No.
- Okay.

18:20.390 --> 18:22.350
I'm guessing if you don't wanna deliver...

18:22.518 --> 18:25.603
...you probably don't wanna
pick up stuff either.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.313
No.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.819
You know what?

18:33.237 --> 18:36.364
- Let's do the catering business.
- Really? Are you sure?

18:36.532 --> 18:40.326
Yeah. You know,
I made a commitment to you.

18:40.494 --> 18:43.538
- Know what? It'd be fun.
- Oh, it will be fun.

18:43.705 --> 18:45.706
- Oh. Yay!
- Aw.

18:45.874 --> 18:48.918
Okay. Ooh, let's plan
the wedding reception. Okay.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.173
Wow.

18:56.093 --> 18:58.427
You really wanted me
to do something with this van.

19:03.142 --> 19:06.018
You know what?
I want you to take the chefjob.

19:06.645 --> 19:09.021
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:09.189 --> 19:11.315
That's what you really want.

19:11.483 --> 19:13.734
Yeah, I don't wanna be the reason
you're unhappy.

19:13.902 --> 19:15.194
That would make me unhappy.

19:15.362 --> 19:18.406
And I really don't wanna be the reason
I'm unhappy.

19:19.491 --> 19:21.159
Thank you.

19:23.662 --> 19:27.081
Besides, it might be kind of fun
to form the new A-Team.

19:36.175 --> 19:39.093
Oh, hi, Mrs. Lynch. Is Joanna in already?

19:39.261 --> 19:41.971
Oh, my goodness. You haven't heard.

19:42.139 --> 19:43.639
Heard what?

19:43.807 --> 19:46.976
Joanna passed away last night.

19:47.144 --> 19:49.812
Oh, my God. How?

19:49.980 --> 19:52.899
Well, she was leaving work,
and she was hit by a cab.

19:53.066 --> 19:55.943
Oh, my God. Oh, I cannot believe it.

19:56.111 --> 19:59.363
- I know.
- Oh, God.

19:59.531 --> 20:04.619
Oh, God.

20:05.370 --> 20:07.997
I didn't realize that you were so close.

20:08.165 --> 20:11.751
Yes. So close.

20:13.420 --> 20:19.508
Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional
and difficult time for all of us.

20:19.676 --> 20:23.512
But by any chance, did Joanna
send any paperwork your way...

20:23.680 --> 20:26.641
...before it happened?

20:26.808 --> 20:29.143
No, nothing.

20:29.311 --> 20:33.940
Imagine, if she'd just stepped off that curb
a few seconds later...

20:34.107 --> 20:39.070
Oh. Yes, yes, just a few seconds
and she'd still be with us.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.656
Nothing about an assistant buyer?

20:42.199 --> 20:44.533
I'm sorry. I have to go.

20:46.995 --> 20:47.995
Good morning.

20:48.163 --> 20:51.123
Oh, Sophie,
I guess you didn't hear about Joanna.

20:51.291 --> 20:52.792
I sure did.

20:58.799 --> 21:01.842
I'm so excited about having Monica
come on board with us.

21:02.010 --> 21:05.846
Although I do feel bad
about having fired Chef Emilio.

21:06.014 --> 21:08.766
It is like losing a member of the family.

21:08.934 --> 21:13.104
Of course, that literally is the case
for several of you.

21:14.690 --> 21:17.358
Tony, Carlos, Marie...

21:17.526 --> 21:21.570
...please tell your father
how much we're going to miss him.

21:23.657 --> 21:27.410
Now, I know that Monica
has a lot of great ideas for this place.

21:27.577 --> 21:30.496
Well, you all read the review. Ha, ha.

21:30.664 --> 21:32.999
So without much further ado...

21:33.166 --> 21:37.295
...I present to you our new head chef.

21:43.468 --> 21:48.222
Um, I just wanna say, uh,
that with a pinch of excitement...

21:48.390 --> 21:51.726
...a dash of hard work,
and a dollop of cooperation...

21:51.893 --> 21:53.853
...we can have the recipe...

21:58.317 --> 21:59.567
Are you going to kill me?
