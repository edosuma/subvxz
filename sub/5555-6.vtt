How you holding up, kiddo?

01:07.599 --> 01:08.499
Ohhh.

01:08.534 --> 01:11.149
This separation thing
is getting really old.

01:11.157 --> 01:12.836
I know.

01:12.870 --> 01:15.204
But Katherine is at a crossroads.

01:15.239 --> 01:17.277
The loss she suffered when she was young

01:17.397 --> 01:18.966
has just changed her in ways

01:18.987 --> 01:23.046
that she is just now beginning to realize.

01:23.080 --> 01:27.584
Can your mother give you a
little unsolicited advice?

01:27.618 --> 01:29.319
- No.
- Too bad.

01:29.353 --> 01:31.303
I need to work on my material.

01:31.314 --> 01:33.222
- Your material?
- Didn't I tell you?

01:33.257 --> 01:34.724
I'm writing a book.

01:34.759 --> 01:37.060
"Unsolicited advice" by Martha Rodgers.

01:37.094 --> 01:38.658
That's...

01:39.529 --> 01:41.197
That's actually a great idea.

01:41.231 --> 01:42.765
I know. Isn't it?

01:42.799 --> 01:44.667
Oh, and your agent loved it, too.

01:44.701 --> 01:46.402
- My agent?
- Never you mind that.

01:46.437 --> 01:48.104
Just listen.

01:48.138 --> 01:49.705
Have faith.

01:49.739 --> 01:51.240
Things between you and Katherine

01:51.275 --> 01:53.709
have a tendency to just
work themselves out.

01:53.743 --> 01:54.677
I think it's probably good

01:54.711 --> 01:57.046
that she's out of town for a couple of days

01:57.081 --> 02:01.717
because a little time apart
is just what you need.

Hi. Welcome to Richard
Castle Investigations.

02:22.438 --> 02:23.934
Wow.

02:24.407 --> 02:26.175
You grew up nice.

02:26.209 --> 02:28.376
I'm sorry... do I know you?

Old friend of your dad's...
Ethan Slaughter.

02:33.649 --> 02:35.250
Of... of course.

02:35.285 --> 02:38.085
Yeah, let me just tell him you're here.

[Door closes]

Defcon one. Slaughter is here.

02:46.955 --> 02:48.262
Here?

02:48.297 --> 02:49.530
Like, right behind the door here?

02:49.564 --> 02:50.731
Yeah.

02:50.765 --> 02:51.866
- What does he want?
- I don't know.

02:51.900 --> 02:53.993
He just said he was an old friend.

02:54.383 --> 02:55.402
That can't be good.

02:55.437 --> 02:56.337
Is that the old friend

02:56.371 --> 02:58.372
who almost got you killed a few years ago?

02:58.406 --> 03:00.374
Yeah, like six times.

03:00.408 --> 03:03.374
Okay, uh, I, uh, uh...

03:03.845 --> 03:05.545
Oh, I'll... I can... I can handle this.

03:05.579 --> 03:06.646
I'll just...

03:06.680 --> 03:08.648
I'll just tell him...

03:08.682 --> 03:11.617
I'll just tell him I'm not interested in,

03:11.652 --> 03:14.628
uh, in whatever he... whatever it is.

03:15.957 --> 03:18.258

03:28.369 --> 03:29.969
Hey, Sherlock. Long time, no see.

03:30.003 --> 03:32.171
[Laughing] Hey! Slaughter!

03:32.205 --> 03:33.662
Buddy. How you been?

03:33.714 --> 03:35.641
Not enough shootouts,
but otherwise, stellar.

03:35.676 --> 03:36.676
Yeah.

03:36.710 --> 03:39.746
You're not gonna find many
shootouts around here.

03:40.036 --> 03:41.614
- Huh.
- So, good seeing you.

03:41.648 --> 03:42.973
You should come back again sometime.

03:42.995 --> 03:45.785
Oh, not so fast. We got
some business to discuss.

03:46.097 --> 03:47.987
What kind of business?

03:48.021 --> 03:49.788
Ma'am,
I don't believe we've had the pleasure.

03:49.822 --> 03:50.952
Don't "ma'am" me, darling.

03:50.953 --> 03:53.292
I'm Martha Rodgers.
Richard Castle is my son.

03:53.326 --> 03:55.794
And the last time
- you two did business together,

03:55.828 --> 03:58.330
he was on antianxiety
medication for a month.

03:58.365 --> 04:01.000
[Chuckles] She's kidding. Kidder.

04:01.034 --> 04:03.002
It's just... it was just a few weeks.

04:03.421 --> 04:05.504
Well, you got a real mama lion here,
Sherlock.

04:05.538 --> 04:07.315
But no reason to worry.

04:07.358 --> 04:09.174
What I'm here about won't
put you in a lick of danger.

04:09.209 --> 04:10.309
I promise.

04:10.343 --> 04:11.343
Hmm. And what's that?

04:11.378 --> 04:13.212
The case I'm working on
and need help with...

04:13.246 --> 04:16.648
a high-end burglary in this big,
shiny building in midtown.

04:16.682 --> 04:18.517
The most secure building in New York?

04:19.038 --> 04:20.863
I just watched a news report about it.

04:20.885 --> 04:24.556
Yeah, seems, uh, somebody was
able to bypass the alarm system

04:24.590 --> 04:27.893
and steal themselves some
sort of top-secret microchip.

04:27.927 --> 04:29.994
The whole... the whole thing's
above my intellectual pay grade,

04:30.029 --> 04:31.663
so I thought Sherlock
here could help me out.

04:31.697 --> 04:33.031
I-I thought you were gang task force.

04:33.065 --> 04:34.633
Oh, yeah, I got tired of that.

04:34.667 --> 04:36.568
I moved on to a whole
new class of dirtbags.

04:36.602 --> 04:39.404
[Chuckles] I-I'm flattered
you thought of me,

04:39.439 --> 04:42.080
but I'm just... I'm... I have my...
my schedule is so full.

04:42.101 --> 04:44.642
- Yeah, we're swamped.
- Completely swamped.

04:44.676 --> 04:45.843
Completely.

04:47.948 --> 04:48.913
Okay.

04:48.947 --> 04:51.214
You don't have to tell me twice. I got it.

04:51.249 --> 04:53.016
Great to see you again, Sherlock.

04:53.051 --> 04:54.585
I had some stories I was gonna tell you

04:54.619 --> 04:56.019
to help you with your next book,

04:56.054 --> 04:58.689
like this time I was
chasing this cartel hit team

04:58.723 --> 05:00.591
through the sewers for three days.

05:00.625 --> 05:03.226
But that's just gonna have
to be for another time.

- Slaughter!

05:20.711 --> 05:22.211
What's our first move?

05:22.245 --> 05:25.181

guy I know named Victor Lee.

05:36.660 --> 05:39.728
All right. Let's find out who
the victim was talking to.

05:39.762 --> 05:41.597
What about that bruising on his face?

05:41.631 --> 05:42.498
That's older.

05:42.532 --> 05:45.961
Looks like someone worked Mr. Lee
over within the last 24 hours.

05:45.962 --> 05:47.670
Any hope of getting a print
off that murder weapon?

05:47.704 --> 05:50.310
Doubtful. Looks like it's been wiped clean.

05:50.447 --> 05:52.073
Hey, Espo.

05:52.108 --> 05:54.042
Guess who the last person
our victim called was.

05:54.076 --> 05:56.829
Do you know how hard it is for me
to not say "your mama" right now?

05:57.125 --> 05:58.747
[Clears throat]

05:58.782 --> 05:59.848
Slaughter?

05:59.882 --> 06:01.183
Slaughter: Hey.

06:01.217 --> 06:03.185
What the hell happened to my guy?

06:03.219 --> 06:05.187
Castle. Slaughter.

06:05.221 --> 06:06.622
This is not a pairing
I would have expected.

06:06.656 --> 06:07.889
I know, right?

06:07.924 --> 06:09.124
Huh?

06:09.158 --> 06:11.192
I mean... together again!

06:11.226 --> 06:12.193
Yay!

06:12.502 --> 06:13.394
You got any leads?

06:13.429 --> 06:15.797
Yeah...
we got our victim calling <i>you</i> last night.

06:15.831 --> 06:17.565
Care to share what you talked about?

06:17.599 --> 06:19.266
Victor was my C.I.

06:19.301 --> 06:21.101
Best damn snitch I ever had.

06:21.136 --> 06:23.371
'Cause he wasn't a criminal.
He managed some burger joint.

06:23.405 --> 06:25.440
But he grew up with a rogues'
gallery of lowlifes,

06:25.474 --> 06:28.108
and they were just too stupid
not to keep bragging to him

06:28.143 --> 06:29.444
about all the crimes they were committing.

06:29.478 --> 06:30.978
So, what was he calling you about?

06:31.012 --> 06:32.613
Ah, he was doing some digging

06:32.648 --> 06:34.549
on this burglary I'm investigating.

06:34.583 --> 06:36.917
Well, looks like that digging
might have got him killed.

06:36.952 --> 06:38.886
Are you saying this is <i>my</i> fault?

06:38.920 --> 06:42.323
I... well, was Victor talking
to anyone else besides you?

06:42.358 --> 06:43.725
No, he said
he was gonna go meet someone.

06:43.759 --> 06:44.925
He didn't give me that name.

06:44.960 --> 06:47.594
All right, then,
our first step is to identify that guy.

06:47.628 --> 06:49.663
No, that's <i>our</i> job.
This is a homicide investigation.

06:49.697 --> 06:52.833
Tough!
It was my case first. Victor was my guy.

06:52.867 --> 06:55.335
So we're gonna find the rodent
that killed him <i>together.</i>

06:55.370 --> 06:56.503
Come on, Sherlock.

06:56.537 --> 06:58.171
All right, but, Slaughter,

06:58.205 --> 07:00.607
you're gonna keep us in the
loop on every move you make.

07:00.641 --> 07:02.275
Of course.

07:02.309 --> 07:03.810
I'm a team player.

07:06.347 --> 07:07.814
I totally lied to those guys.

07:07.849 --> 07:10.851
I already got a line on
who Victor might have met with last night.

07:10.885 --> 07:13.019
Don't you think that's
information we should share

07:13.053 --> 07:14.320
with Ryan and Esposito?

07:14.355 --> 07:15.220
Nah.

07:15.255 --> 07:16.221
Isn't this fun?

07:16.256 --> 07:17.656
You and me together again.

07:17.691 --> 07:19.124

Like Butch and Sundance.

07:19.158 --> 07:20.659
[Doors open]

07:20.694 --> 07:23.729
You know they die at the end of the movie,
right?

07:23.764 --> 07:26.632
Yeah. But what a way to go.

07:28.702 --> 07:31.103
I can't believe it.
I just talked to him yesterday.

07:31.137 --> 07:32.772
What did you talk to him about?

07:32.806 --> 07:34.139
Getting back together.

07:34.173 --> 07:35.474
We broke up a few months ago.

07:35.509 --> 07:37.476
I got sick of him not keeping his word.

07:37.511 --> 07:39.978
But he said it was gonna
be different this time.

07:40.013 --> 07:42.681
Told me he was about to
come into some big money.

07:42.716 --> 07:45.483
We were talking about
taking off together...

07:45.518 --> 07:47.252
California.

07:47.287 --> 07:49.087
I always wanted to live on the beach.

07:49.122 --> 07:51.489
Did he say where this big
money was coming from?

07:51.974 --> 07:52.891
No.

07:53.039 --> 07:55.560
Would you excuse us for a second?

07:59.232 --> 08:00.832
Do you think
Victor might have been involved

08:00.866 --> 08:01.967
in stealing that microchip?

08:02.001 --> 08:03.668
No way. He was a straight arrow.

08:03.702 --> 08:05.103
I know you liked the guy,

08:05.138 --> 08:06.805
but he was working a minimum-wage job

08:06.839 --> 08:09.441
while all his criminal buddies
were pulling in big cash.

08:09.475 --> 08:10.875
Is it so impossible to believe

08:10.910 --> 08:13.445
that he might have given in to temptation?

08:13.479 --> 08:15.146
Yeah, it's possible.

08:15.180 --> 08:17.651
I just hate the idea he was playing me.

08:18.759 --> 08:21.352
Did Victor say who he was
meeting with last night?

08:21.386 --> 08:23.521
Some guy named Trucco.

08:24.657 --> 08:26.958
So,
I looked into Slaughter's burglary case.

08:26.992 --> 08:28.560
The burglars made off with

08:28.594 --> 08:31.062
a microchip for a next-gen cellphone.

08:31.096 --> 08:33.631
Prototype is worth north of a
million bucks on the black market.

08:33.666 --> 08:35.967
[Cellphone dings] Vikram is looking
in the database of known fences

08:36.001 --> 08:37.534
to find out who deals in that kind of loot.

08:37.570 --> 08:40.572
Yo. CSU managed to find a
print on the murder weapon.

08:40.606 --> 08:42.340
It was hidden
under the hilt of the knife.

08:42.374 --> 08:43.674
They get a match in the system?

08:43.707 --> 08:45.576
Yeah, they're sending it now.

08:45.610 --> 08:47.010
Here it is.

08:49.180 --> 08:50.681
What?

08:50.713 --> 08:52.402
Yeah. Got it.

08:52.403 --> 08:53.183

09:32.931 --> 09:33.998
What were you, uh, what were you saying?

09:34.032 --> 09:35.233
We're headed to you right now.

09:35.267 --> 09:37.468
Oh, you're going to the club.
Uh, how long till you get there?

09:37.503 --> 09:39.070
We are five minutes away.

09:39.104 --> 09:40.037
So just play it cool.

09:40.072 --> 09:41.639
Yeah,
don't let on that you're talking to us.

09:41.674 --> 09:43.341
Yeah, no problem.

09:43.375 --> 09:45.009
That ain't your mom.

09:45.043 --> 09:47.017
It's Elvez and lucky charms, isn't it?

09:48.045 --> 09:48.945
There's a slight problem.

09:48.979 --> 09:50.547
Give me that phone. [Cellphone beeps]

09:55.052 --> 09:57.153
What are you, Inspector Gadget?
This is a gun, not a pen.

09:57.188 --> 09:59.690
You don't keep it in your desk.
You strap it to your side.

09:59.724 --> 10:01.725
Or, in your case, keep it in your purse.

10:01.759 --> 10:02.892
Please don't kill me.

10:02.927 --> 10:05.061
- I'm not gonna kill you.
- Is that what you told Victor

10:05.096 --> 10:06.496
before you buried a knife in his neck?

10:06.531 --> 10:07.698
That wasn't me.

10:07.732 --> 10:10.166
Then why were your fingerprints
all over the murder weapon?

10:10.599 --> 10:12.902
I gave Victor that knife as a thank-you.

10:12.937 --> 10:14.370
A thank-you gi...

10:14.404 --> 10:16.005
flowers are a nice thank-you gift.

10:16.040 --> 10:17.907
A giant Rambo knife... that's psychotic.

10:17.942 --> 10:19.743
Eh, different strokes. But it's the truth.

10:19.777 --> 10:21.111
Then just turn yourself in to the boys.

10:21.145 --> 10:22.511
They'll treat you fairly.

10:22.546 --> 10:24.247
It ain't that simple.

10:24.478 --> 10:26.850
I may have hit Victor a
few times yesterday morning

10:26.884 --> 10:28.618
when he wouldn't look
into that burglary for me.

10:28.652 --> 10:29.886
But I didn't kill him.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.921
Says the man holding a gun on me.

10:32.150 --> 10:33.522
Eh, here. Take it.

10:33.557 --> 10:34.924
Take it!

10:35.147 --> 10:36.259
I didn't tell you any of this before

10:36.293 --> 10:37.775
'cause I know how it looks.

10:37.807 --> 10:39.796
You didn't doubt for a
second that I killed Victor.

10:39.830 --> 10:41.030
Neither will anyone else.

10:41.065 --> 10:43.665
So the only way to clear my
name is to find the real killer.

10:45.001 --> 10:46.148
So...

10:47.984 --> 10:49.546
Why come to <i>me?</i>

10:50.685 --> 10:53.075
'Cause I got a lot of enemies.

10:53.109 --> 10:54.886
What I don't got's a friend.

10:57.155 --> 10:59.213
I need a friend, Sherlock.

11:11.676 --> 11:12.960
Esposito: Where's Slaughter?

11:12.995 --> 11:15.163
He's gone. He left a few minutes ago.

11:15.197 --> 11:17.631
- What happened?
- He insisted he was innocent.

11:17.666 --> 11:19.767
Said he gave that knife
to Victor as a gift.

11:19.802 --> 11:22.236
A gift?
What's wrong with a nice bottle of wine?

11:22.271 --> 11:22.970
I know!

11:23.005 --> 11:24.738
But, guys, I got to tell you

11:24.773 --> 11:26.107
he really seemed like he
was telling the truth.

11:26.141 --> 11:27.041
Ryan: [Scoffs] Forget it.

11:27.075 --> 11:29.243
You can't trust a word what that guy says.

11:29.278 --> 11:31.012
You, above all people,
should know that, Castle.

11:31.046 --> 11:31.946
It was only a matter of time

11:31.980 --> 11:33.514
until he crossed the line and got caught.

11:33.548 --> 11:35.316
You're just lucky to be alive.

11:35.350 --> 11:37.117
Stay away from him.

11:49.864 --> 11:52.800
I do not like lying to those guys,
but you were right.

11:52.834 --> 11:55.035
They're not gonna give you
the benefit of the doubt.

11:55.069 --> 11:57.103
You're a good man, Sherlock.

11:57.138 --> 11:59.873
Now we're neck-deep in this <i>together.</i>

11:59.907 --> 12:01.074
Well, we better get to work.

12:01.108 --> 12:04.110
Ryan and Esposito are good cops.
They're going to find you.

12:04.145 --> 12:05.178
All right.

12:05.213 --> 12:07.314
Let's go hang Trucco
out a window till he talks...

12:07.348 --> 12:08.548
or we lose or grip.

12:08.582 --> 12:10.817
<i>Vamonos, muchacho.</i>

12:15.656 --> 12:18.191
So, where is this guy?

12:18.226 --> 12:20.395
My source says he'll be here.

12:21.162 --> 12:22.695
Hey, any chance that smokin' wife of ours

12:22.730 --> 12:24.364
is gonna come hunting for me, too?

12:24.398 --> 12:26.166
Might be worth getting caught
if she does the cuffing.

12:26.200 --> 12:30.469
Um... No, Beckett and I are
sort of on a time-out right now.

12:30.965 --> 12:33.138
Oh. Sorry to hear that.

12:33.867 --> 12:34.806
Thanks.

12:34.841 --> 12:36.976
So, uh, what happened?

12:37.010 --> 12:38.110
I don't know.

12:38.144 --> 12:40.746
She just said she needed
time to figure things out.

12:40.780 --> 12:42.014
Women.

12:42.048 --> 12:43.148
[Chuckling] Yeah.

12:43.492 --> 12:45.084
If you're looking for a rebound,

12:45.118 --> 12:47.386
my cousin Shauna's got a nympho roommate.

12:48.729 --> 12:52.057
Um... I'm good... I can...
I'm good, thanks.

12:52.092 --> 12:53.392
Well, all right. Suit yourself.

12:53.426 --> 12:55.527
Nothing makes a woman want you
more than moving on, though, right?

12:55.561 --> 12:56.895
Okay, conversation's over.

12:56.929 --> 12:59.431
And... and... and another thing.

12:59.465 --> 13:02.166
This time, <i>you</i> need <i>me.</i>

13:02.201 --> 13:04.035
So we're gonna play by <i>my</i> rules.

13:04.069 --> 13:05.937
And what rules are those?

13:05.971 --> 13:07.506
You're not gonna hurt anybody.

13:07.540 --> 13:09.441
You're not gonna intimidate anybody.

13:09.475 --> 13:11.877
You're not even gonna raise your voice.

13:11.890 --> 13:14.178
You do, and I'm out.

13:15.715 --> 13:18.050
You're kidding, right? [Chuckles]

13:18.077 --> 13:19.050
No.

13:23.155 --> 13:24.455
Okay. Deal.

13:24.489 --> 13:27.024
Hey! Trucco! Ha ha!

13:27.058 --> 13:28.626
Time to pay the Piper, buddy.

13:28.660 --> 13:31.228
Hey, hey, hey, hey! What did I just say?

13:31.262 --> 13:33.297
Huh? Oh.

13:33.331 --> 13:35.265
Oh. [Clears throat]

13:37.001 --> 13:38.636
My apologies, Mr. Trucco.

13:38.670 --> 13:41.104
My name is Detective Slaughter,
and this is Castle.

13:41.139 --> 13:44.542
We'd like to have a little chat
with you about a Victor Lee.

13:44.576 --> 13:45.643
Never heard of him.

13:45.677 --> 13:47.710
[Clears throat]

13:49.280 --> 13:50.380
Mr. Trucco...

13:50.415 --> 13:53.450
We both know that you fence
high-tech items for a living

13:53.484 --> 13:54.952
and that you had a deal with Victor Lee

13:54.986 --> 13:57.387
to move a certain microchip that he stole.

13:57.422 --> 13:59.622
Now, unless you want us
to go check out your place

13:59.657 --> 14:02.092
and see if we can find
any stolen merchandise,

14:02.126 --> 14:04.669
I strongly recommend you
tell us what we want to know.

14:05.052 --> 14:06.129
And what's that?

14:06.164 --> 14:09.232
Did you buy a stolen microchip
from Victor last night?

14:09.267 --> 14:10.334
No.

14:10.368 --> 14:11.435
Ass clown, I'll tear your face off.

14:11.469 --> 14:12.735
Dude!

14:18.175 --> 14:20.276
Please, sir, tell us the truth.

14:20.310 --> 14:21.578
I am.

14:21.926 --> 14:23.156
Look, Victor and his partner were

14:23.180 --> 14:25.582
supposed to meet me last night,
but they never showed.

14:25.616 --> 14:27.450
- Who's his partner?
- I don't know.

14:27.485 --> 14:29.106
But from the way Victor talked about him,

14:29.119 --> 14:31.120
it seems like they weren't
gonna be partners for long.

14:35.874 --> 14:37.159
You thinking what I'm thinking?

14:37.194 --> 14:38.828
Uh, probably not.

14:38.863 --> 14:40.429
Like, maybe Victor got greedy

14:40.464 --> 14:42.320
[snaps fingers] Tried to
double-cross his partner?

14:42.611 --> 14:45.101
The partner might have killed him for it.

14:45.135 --> 14:47.203
Nice going, Sherlock. See?
We make a perfect team.

14:47.237 --> 14:48.534
Let's go.

14:52.575 --> 14:54.222
[Bottles clank]

14:55.040 --> 14:56.253
What was that?

14:56.267 --> 14:57.613
What was what?

14:59.816 --> 15:01.183
Ryan: Hey, check this out.

15:01.218 --> 15:04.685
Traffic cam caught Victor
parked a block away

15:04.720 --> 15:06.321
from where the microchip was stolen.

15:06.355 --> 15:09.324
That is Victor right before the burglary.

15:09.358 --> 15:10.858
And there's someone with him.

15:10.893 --> 15:12.293
Must be a partner. Is there a better look?

15:12.328 --> 15:13.528
Nope.

15:13.562 --> 15:15.497
What if that's Slaughter?

15:15.531 --> 15:17.065
I spoke to his captain.

15:17.099 --> 15:18.633
Slaughter was reassigned from gangs

15:18.667 --> 15:20.068
because a dealer accused him

15:20.102 --> 15:21.920
of pocketing 20k during a drug bust.

15:21.947 --> 15:24.308
Word is,
Slaughter was about to be suspended...

15:24.361 --> 15:26.207
quite possibly kicked off the job.

15:26.242 --> 15:27.675
Which means "bye-bye, pension."

15:27.709 --> 15:28.774
The microchip burglary

15:28.775 --> 15:30.702
might have been Slaughter's
retirement plan.

15:30.732 --> 15:32.325
And if Victor tried to double-cross him...

15:32.368 --> 15:33.748
Slaughter would have put him down.

15:34.014 --> 15:36.605
But why involve Castle in all of this?

15:36.843 --> 15:39.449
Maybe Victor hid the
microchip before he died.

15:39.450 --> 15:40.491
Slaughter couldn't find it.

15:40.492 --> 15:42.489
And so he thought he could fool Castle

15:42.524 --> 15:45.325
into using his unique
brain to help him find it.

15:45.360 --> 15:48.696
Well, it's a good thing
Castle's not dumb enough to fall for that.

15:49.798 --> 15:51.231
So, where do you think the chip is?

15:51.266 --> 15:52.889
If Victor's partner
didn't sell it to Trucco,

15:52.902 --> 15:54.024
then they probably still have it.

15:54.050 --> 15:56.370
Ah-ha-ha-ha.

15:56.404 --> 15:58.572
Whoa. Hey, who's the talent?

15:58.606 --> 15:59.873
Slaughter, this is Hayley.

15:59.907 --> 16:01.107
Hi.

16:01.141 --> 16:03.909
No wonder you weren't interested
in that nympho roommate, huh?

16:03.944 --> 16:05.078
I'm sorry... what?

16:05.112 --> 16:06.212
Uh, just... Forget it.

16:06.246 --> 16:09.449
Um, Hayley just started working
with me as a consultant.

16:09.483 --> 16:12.251
Yes, Rick has asked me
to suss out the break-in at Booth tower.

16:12.286 --> 16:14.920
Oh, and she speaks British. That's hot.

16:14.955 --> 16:15.788
Wow.

16:15.822 --> 16:17.963
It's always a pleasure
meeting one of your friends, Rick.

16:17.964 --> 16:20.859
He's really not... just...
Please ignore him.

16:20.894 --> 16:22.195
Did you find anything?

16:22.229 --> 16:23.490
Of course I did.

16:23.563 --> 16:26.298
So, the security system at Booth tower
is definitely cutting-edge.

16:26.332 --> 16:29.005
It would have taken a
genius-level digital locksmith

16:29.006 --> 16:31.036
to get through the several
layers of the alarm system.

16:31.070 --> 16:32.137
Genius.

16:32.171 --> 16:34.172
That sure as hell ain't Victor
or anyone he hangs with.

16:34.207 --> 16:35.240
You sure about that?

16:35.275 --> 16:36.375
'Cause I did some digging,

16:36.410 --> 16:38.685
and it turns out that Victor
volunteered as a mentor

16:38.686 --> 16:40.746
to an underprivileged 16-year-old boy

16:40.781 --> 16:42.748
named Louis Prince.

16:42.783 --> 16:44.383
Now, I have Louis' records,

16:44.418 --> 16:46.385
and he has quite the history of violence.

16:46.420 --> 16:47.887
Turns out he's been in and out

16:47.921 --> 16:49.922
of several juvenile detention facilities,

16:49.956 --> 16:52.190
and he was kicked out of four high schools.

16:52.225 --> 16:54.011
Doesn't sound too smart to me.

16:55.568 --> 16:56.895
Is that his I.Q.?

16:56.930 --> 16:59.464
Oh, yes... 190.

16:59.498 --> 17:01.099
It's like a criminal good will hunting?

17:01.134 --> 17:03.017
Yeah.

17:03.083 --> 17:05.603
And it looks like he's graduated to murder.

17:08.589 --> 17:09.833
Louis has had a rough life.

17:09.891 --> 17:11.791
He was abandoned by his
father when he was 5,

17:11.826 --> 17:13.194
and then he was raised by his mother,

17:13.228 --> 17:14.895
who has to work two jobs to support him.

17:14.929 --> 17:16.530
Kid was on his own 20 hours a day.

17:16.565 --> 17:18.531
Not all latchkey kids wind up killers.

17:18.567 --> 17:21.701
Yeah, they're not all
Einstein-level geniuses, either.

17:21.734 --> 17:24.304
Louis was... honestly was just too smart.

17:24.338 --> 17:26.472
And he didn't have anyone
to help nurture his talents,

17:26.507 --> 17:30.476
so all he could do was lash out.

17:30.511 --> 17:32.312
That's when I first met him.

17:32.346 --> 17:34.247
I knew right away
he was the perfect candidate

17:34.281 --> 17:35.415
for operation mentor.

17:35.449 --> 17:36.449
What he needed more than anything

17:36.483 --> 17:38.651
was a strong male role
model to look out for him.

17:38.686 --> 17:40.553
- That was Victor.
- Eventually, yes,

17:40.588 --> 17:42.954
but Louis went through
five other mentors first.

17:42.988 --> 17:45.090
I got a lot of pressure to
kick him out of the program.

17:45.124 --> 17:47.459
Victor was my last shot,
but they hit it off right away,

17:47.493 --> 17:48.760
and Louis started getting better.

17:48.794 --> 17:51.830
You know, detective,
<i>you</i> should consider becoming a mentor.

17:51.864 --> 17:54.132
[Coughs]

17:54.166 --> 17:56.735
Yeah, um, I'm not role-model material.

17:56.769 --> 17:58.367
He's really not.

17:58.591 --> 18:00.672
- You never know.
- I wasn't always a counselor.

18:00.707 --> 18:02.741
I used to chase money around
Wall Street for 15 hours a day,

18:02.775 --> 18:05.744
but this here...
this is definitely more fulfilling.

18:05.778 --> 18:06.678
Yes, I imagine so.

18:06.713 --> 18:10.282
Now, if Victor were to use Louis' genius

18:10.316 --> 18:12.651
to help commit a crime,
that would have been

18:12.685 --> 18:14.018
quite a betrayal of trust, wouldn't it?

18:14.053 --> 18:15.954
Enough to make him snap
and kill his mentor?

18:15.988 --> 18:19.423
Well, Victor was the first
person that Louis ever trusted,

18:19.458 --> 18:20.591
besides his mom,

18:20.626 --> 18:22.426
so finding out he'd been betrayed

18:22.461 --> 18:24.595
would have been pretty devastating.

18:26.031 --> 18:27.766
Any idea where Louis might be hiding?

18:27.800 --> 18:29.700
Ah, I don't know. Sorry.

18:29.735 --> 18:32.036
Oh. Uh, thank you very much for your time,
Mr. West.

18:32.071 --> 18:33.872
Uh, w-we got to go... <i>now.</i>

18:33.906 --> 18:35.406
Oh. Yeah, thanks.

18:44.048 --> 18:46.651
Mr. West. I'm Detective Ryan.

18:46.685 --> 18:48.719
This is Detective Esposito. NYPD.

18:48.754 --> 18:50.554
We just have a few questions about a kid

18:50.589 --> 18:54.024
that Victor Lee was
mentoring named Louis Prince.

18:54.058 --> 18:55.726
It's possible he might
have some information

18:55.761 --> 18:57.027
that can help us solve a crime.

18:57.061 --> 18:59.497
That's funny... you guys just missed
the two other cops that were here.

18:59.531 --> 19:01.554
They were asking about Louis, too.

19:04.903 --> 19:06.136
Yes. Got it.

19:06.171 --> 19:07.537
Hayley managed to track Louis down

19:07.571 --> 19:09.873
using the I.P. address on his computer.
[Call-waiting beep] I have an address.

19:09.908 --> 19:11.909
Thank you very much for doing this, Hayley.

19:11.943 --> 19:13.643
I-I have another call. Thanks.

19:13.678 --> 19:15.378
[Cellphone beeps] This is Castle.

19:15.413 --> 19:16.914
You lied to us?

19:18.053 --> 19:19.413
Ohh. Well, when you put it that way...

19:19.450 --> 19:21.218
Castle, no. This is not funny.

19:21.235 --> 19:23.304
What are you doing running
around with our murder suspect?

19:23.305 --> 19:25.140
Hey, Slaughter didn't kill anyone,
all right?

19:25.172 --> 19:26.123
I promise you.

19:26.157 --> 19:28.191
He wants to find Victor's
killer just as much as we do.

19:28.225 --> 19:30.760
Really? Did he tell you why
he's not working gangs anymore?

19:30.795 --> 19:32.495
Yes... he said he got bored.

19:32.530 --> 19:33.996
No. He got demoted.

19:34.031 --> 19:37.574
He's under investigation
for robbing a drug dealer.

19:37.768 --> 19:39.536
You robbed a drug dealer?

19:39.570 --> 19:41.538
Oh, hell no. That's a B.S. charge.

19:41.572 --> 19:43.340
Slaughter's about to lose his pension,
Castle.

19:43.374 --> 19:45.942
We figure that he teamed up
with Victor to steal that chip,

19:45.976 --> 19:47.744
and then he got greedy.

19:47.778 --> 19:48.778
Give me that.

19:48.813 --> 19:51.681
Hey, Detective,
get your head out of our butt!

19:51.716 --> 19:53.282
Yeah, sure,
I might have tuned Victor up a little bit,

19:53.317 --> 19:54.216
but I didn't kill him.

19:54.250 --> 19:56.719
You're wasting your time chasing after me.

19:56.753 --> 19:58.019
You should be after the kid.

19:58.054 --> 19:59.822
Y...
[Cellphone clatters]

20:01.504 --> 20:02.057
Hello?

20:02.091 --> 20:04.760
You know you can just take
the S.I.M. card out, right?

20:07.129 --> 20:09.588
I lose more phones in this line of work.

20:12.244 --> 20:16.372
If I wanted to just walk away,
you would let me, right?

20:16.406 --> 20:17.406
Having second thoughts?

20:17.440 --> 20:19.640
I think that's reasonable,
given your history.

20:19.675 --> 20:21.376
You mean given <i>our</i> history.

[Crash, clatter]

Hey! Hey! Freeze!

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Relax, relax.
We're not here to hurt you.

20:35.824 --> 20:37.458
Please. Please stay away from me.

[Spits]

20:46.968 --> 20:48.769
Come here.

20:48.803 --> 20:51.005
You're okay. Come on.

20:51.039 --> 20:52.940
We're just trying to figure
out what happened to Victor.

20:52.974 --> 20:54.975
I didn't kill him. I swear.

20:55.435 --> 20:56.680
Hey, hey.

20:59.714 --> 21:01.366
No one's saying you did.

21:04.561 --> 21:05.841
Really?!

[Door handle clicking]

21:14.995 --> 21:17.330
Not your proudest moment, huh?

21:17.364 --> 21:18.331
[Panting]

21:18.365 --> 21:19.499
I don't think he did it.

21:19.534 --> 21:20.834
Sure he did.

21:20.868 --> 21:22.869
You didn't see his face.

21:22.904 --> 21:25.004
He was scared and young.

21:25.039 --> 21:27.006
It's not the face of a killer.

21:27.438 --> 21:30.677
We're <i>all</i> killers, Castle,
when push comes to shove.

21:30.711 --> 21:31.989
Come on.

21:34.165 --> 21:35.114
[Slaughter grunts]

21:35.149 --> 21:37.984
Do I still have to play nice?

21:38.018 --> 21:38.941
No.

21:39.258 --> 21:40.234
Good.

21:41.255 --> 21:43.022
Now, you're gonna tell me
what you're doing here,

21:43.057 --> 21:45.358
or I'm gonna pull your dipstick
up to your chin like a zipper.

21:45.392 --> 21:46.960
Okay, I came for the kid.

21:46.994 --> 21:47.961
Why?

21:47.995 --> 21:49.195
'Cause he's the key.

21:49.229 --> 21:50.363
- I'm gonna start zipping.
- No, wait!

21:50.397 --> 21:53.799
Look, I work for a crew that
specializes in high-end B&Es,

21:53.834 --> 21:55.534
run by a guy named David Lacey.

21:55.569 --> 21:57.203
Ugh. I know Lacey.

21:57.237 --> 21:58.972
He gives sociopaths a bad name.

21:59.006 --> 22:00.539
So you guys helped Victor
steal the microchip?

22:00.574 --> 22:01.341
No.

22:01.375 --> 22:02.275
[Grunts]

22:02.309 --> 22:04.344
See, now he's insulting our intelligence.

22:04.378 --> 22:05.178
Go get the shower curtain.

22:05.212 --> 22:06.679
This is gonna get a little messy.

22:06.713 --> 22:07.713
No, no, it's true!

22:08.882 --> 22:11.150
Victor and the kid pulled off
the microchip job alone...

22:11.185 --> 22:12.685
to send a message.

22:12.719 --> 22:14.053
What kind of message?

22:14.088 --> 22:15.388
Victor was going around town

22:15.422 --> 22:17.990
boasting that he had the key to any lock.

22:18.024 --> 22:19.257
Meaning Louis?

22:19.292 --> 22:22.094
The kid invented a device that
could disarm any alarm system,

22:22.128 --> 22:23.228
no matter how complex.

22:23.262 --> 22:25.998
So breaking into the Booth
tower put the town on notice

22:26.032 --> 22:28.867
that Victor's services were
available to the highest bidder.

22:28.901 --> 22:31.669
So Victor was using Louis.

22:31.704 --> 22:35.106
Only your boss, Lacey,
wasn't interested in paying Victor's price.

22:35.140 --> 22:37.742
So Victor ends up dead, you come here,
pick up the kid free of charge.

22:37.776 --> 22:40.077

22:48.086 --> 22:50.588
Easy with that. It's a little
more weapon than you're used to.

22:50.623 --> 22:51.389
Yeah.

22:51.423 --> 22:53.057
You have the right to remain silent.

22:53.091 --> 22:55.326
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Heard it all before.

Espo. Espo. He didn't kill Victor.

23:03.101 --> 23:06.037
And if my instincts are right,
neither did Louis,

23:06.071 --> 23:08.705
which means there is a
16-year-old kid out there alone

23:08.740 --> 23:10.874
with a very dangerous crew after him.

23:10.909 --> 23:13.077
We're gonna need all
hands on deck to find him.

What happens when we don't get the car back
to the motor pool at the end of our shift?

24:24.210 --> 24:25.477
I think we should call Beckett.

And tell her what... that her husband

24:27.379 --> 24:29.447
staged a jailbreak right under our noses?

Why not?

24:48.466 --> 24:49.634

24:49.668 --> 24:50.868
would be a terrible idea.

Well, we haven't seen him for hours.

26:08.210 --> 26:09.811

But wait, wait.
Why did you arrest Slaughter?

26:23.325 --> 26:25.393
According to dad,
he didn't kill Victor Lee.

26:25.428 --> 26:27.261
- That's not the point.
- It's kind of the point.

26:27.296 --> 26:28.563
Look, we had reason to believe

26:28.597 --> 26:29.931
that Slaughter killed Victor, but...

26:29.965 --> 26:31.666
Now we're... not so sure.

26:31.700 --> 26:33.600
Well, I can tell you this...
that genius kid Louis

26:33.635 --> 26:35.069
definitely didn't kill him, either.

26:35.103 --> 26:36.137
How do you know that?

26:36.171 --> 26:38.439
While I was tracking his
I.P. address for Castle,

26:38.473 --> 26:40.474
I noticed that during
the time of the murder,

26:40.508 --> 26:41.675
Louis was at a coffee shop in Brooklyn.

26:41.709 --> 26:43.444
And a barista remembers seeing him.

26:43.478 --> 26:45.913
Which makes David Lacey our prime suspect.

26:45.948 --> 26:47.614
Who's this Lacey guy?

26:47.649 --> 26:50.184
He runs a heist crew...
with a trail of bodies.

26:50.218 --> 26:52.519
We've got one of his soldiers in holding,
and he's not talking.

26:52.554 --> 26:54.555

- Who are you?
- Yeah.

I do some of my best
thinking when I'm cooking.

27:16.877 --> 27:18.544
It's what got me through my divorce.

27:18.579 --> 27:20.570
What happened with you and Maddie?

27:21.362 --> 27:23.349
Her career took off.

27:23.383 --> 27:24.383
Mine failed to launch.

27:24.417 --> 27:25.718
I got jealous.

27:25.752 --> 27:27.520
Went downhill from there.

27:27.554 --> 27:29.655
What really happened
with you and <i>your</i> wife?

27:29.690 --> 27:31.190
I told you... I don't know.

27:31.224 --> 27:33.225
You're too smart to be talking this stupid,
Sherlock.

27:33.259 --> 27:34.560
If you really love that broad,

27:34.595 --> 27:37.319

Please... uh, have a seat.

37:41.001 --> 37:42.335
[Sighs] Poor kid.

37:42.369 --> 37:44.603
He's... he's been through so much.

37:44.638 --> 37:46.139
You know, I'd like to testify

37:46.173 --> 37:47.907
as a character witness on Louis' behalf

37:47.942 --> 37:49.175
when his case goes to trial.

37:49.210 --> 37:51.110
That's very kind of you, Mr. West.

37:51.145 --> 37:53.693
But won't you be too
busy with your <i>own</i> trial?

37:55.213 --> 37:57.081
[Chuckles] <i>My</i> trial?
What are you talking about?

37:57.123 --> 37:58.017
We know.

37:58.052 --> 37:59.285
You know what?

37:59.320 --> 38:02.521
Well, for starters,
you didn't always work with at-risk youth.

38:02.556 --> 38:04.522
No, I mean, I've had other jobs. So?

38:04.557 --> 38:06.992
So you were Mr. Booth's accountant,

38:07.026 --> 38:09.328
where you worked on his
most sensitive matters.

38:09.362 --> 38:11.930
Like setting up tax
shelters in offshore banks.

38:11.965 --> 38:14.333
Well, yeah, but the work was unfulfilling,

38:14.367 --> 38:16.501
so I left because I wanted to
give back to the community.

38:16.535 --> 38:18.770
No, you wanted to give
back to Mr. Booth's wife,

38:18.804 --> 38:21.206
but she didn't appreciate
your sexual advances,

38:21.241 --> 38:23.441
so Mr. Booth fired your ass.

38:23.476 --> 38:26.111
Yeah, you lost your job,
you lost your pension,

38:26.145 --> 38:27.379
all those stock options.

38:27.413 --> 38:28.847
All right. Listen. [Clears throat]

38:28.882 --> 38:30.048
I know how this looks, but...

38:30.083 --> 38:31.783
Your reputation was ruined.

38:31.817 --> 38:34.486
The only job you could get
was working with juvenile delinquents.

38:34.520 --> 38:36.654
Not exactly the cushy
life you were used to.

38:36.689 --> 38:38.890
So you heard about Louis' invention,

38:38.924 --> 38:41.359
and you saw not only a
way to get back on top...

38:41.393 --> 38:43.527
But also get revenge on your former boss,

38:43.561 --> 38:45.029
who ruined your life.

38:45.063 --> 38:46.463
That's why you convinced Victor

38:46.498 --> 38:48.065
to pull that heist, didn't you?

38:48.100 --> 38:50.134
So that you could go in right behind him

38:50.168 --> 38:52.336
and steal those Cayman Island bank codes.

38:52.371 --> 38:56.480
Well, that is an imaginative story.

38:56.741 --> 39:00.477
It had surprise twists, revenge.

39:00.512 --> 39:03.247
All that's missing is the proof.

39:03.282 --> 39:05.582
Like records of the bank transfers

39:05.617 --> 39:07.084
on your home computer?

39:07.119 --> 39:08.920
We got a warrant for your place, Mark.

39:08.954 --> 39:10.521
We also have a credit-card receipt

39:10.555 --> 39:12.722
for a cab ride that you
took to Victor's apartment

39:12.756 --> 39:14.391
on the night he was murdered.

39:15.859 --> 39:17.160
It's over, Mr. West.

39:17.194 --> 39:18.661
Look, Victor wasn't supposed to know

39:18.695 --> 39:19.729
what I was doing, all right?

39:19.763 --> 39:20.997
But somehow he found out,

39:21.032 --> 39:22.999
and he confronted me at his apartment.

39:23.034 --> 39:24.434
Now, I panicked, okay?

39:24.468 --> 39:25.936
I...

39:25.970 --> 39:27.537
I didn't mean to kill him.

39:27.571 --> 39:30.407
I... you have to believe me.
That was not...

39:30.441 --> 39:32.042
[handcuffs click]

39:32.076 --> 39:33.076
[Sighs]

39:33.110 --> 39:35.145
[Buzzer]

39:37.781 --> 39:39.968
[Door slides, closes]

39:40.010 --> 39:42.484
Ah, come on. It ain't that bad, kid.

39:43.345 --> 39:45.254
We caught the bastard, didn't we?

39:45.288 --> 39:46.301
Yeah.

39:46.776 --> 39:48.623
But I'm still going to prison.

39:49.151 --> 39:51.061
How much time am I looking at?

39:51.082 --> 39:52.627
Maybe none.

39:53.045 --> 39:54.463
What? How?

39:54.497 --> 39:56.598
You're a good kid, Louis.

39:56.632 --> 40:00.569
Too good to be rotting in a cell
for a few bonehead decisions.

40:00.603 --> 40:02.637
So from now on,
I'm gonna personally see to it

40:02.672 --> 40:04.773
that you got someone looking out for you...

40:04.807 --> 40:07.542
that you got a <i>cool</i> role model.

40:07.577 --> 40:09.244
You mean Mr. Castle?

40:09.279 --> 40:10.778
No.

40:10.812 --> 40:11.879
Me.

40:12.727 --> 40:13.547
Really?

40:13.582 --> 40:14.548
You bet.

40:14.583 --> 40:16.584
First thing I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna use my pull

40:16.618 --> 40:19.387
to get the mayor to ask the
D.A. to reduce your sentence

40:19.421 --> 40:20.421
down to probation.

40:20.456 --> 40:22.390
You've got that kind of
clout with the mayor?

40:22.424 --> 40:24.225
Hell no. Castle does.

40:24.259 --> 40:26.494
And I'm gonna see to it
that he makes that call...

40:26.528 --> 40:27.362
or else.

40:27.396 --> 40:29.163
S-so you're gonna beat up Mr. Castle

40:29.198 --> 40:30.498
if he doesn't do what you ask?

40:30.532 --> 40:32.000
[Chuckling] Oh.

40:32.340 --> 40:33.553
Some role model.

40:36.646 --> 40:37.938
Yeah.

40:38.419 --> 40:39.802
You got a point.

40:40.642 --> 40:41.742
Looks like the two of
us are gonna have to do

40:41.776 --> 40:43.611
some role modeling for each other.

40:43.823 --> 40:45.078
Sound good?

40:49.551 --> 40:51.585
[Door opens]

40:53.041 --> 40:53.954
[Door closes]

40:56.070 --> 40:58.692
Slaughter: Uh-oh.
You got that dumb look on your face again.

40:58.727 --> 41:00.628
I...

41:00.662 --> 41:02.930
I don't know.
I'm just confused about Beckett.

41:02.964 --> 41:03.797
That makes two of us.

41:03.832 --> 41:05.532
I mean, how does a hot lady like that

41:05.566 --> 41:07.134
fall in love with a guy like you...

41:07.168 --> 41:08.801
especially when there's a real man,
like me, running around?

41:08.836 --> 41:09.936
Okay, Slaughter, you know what?

41:09.970 --> 41:11.771
I'll take a lot of crap from you,
but not about Beckett.

41:11.805 --> 41:12.739
It's not a joke to me.

41:12.773 --> 41:15.008
Just trying to get your attention,
Sherlock.

41:16.010 --> 41:17.511
Look, I don't know much,

41:17.545 --> 41:20.147
but what I do know is that
lady has it bad for you,

41:20.181 --> 41:21.515
and you feel the same.

41:21.549 --> 41:22.849
Your point?

41:22.883 --> 41:24.451
Whatever's going on with Beckett,

41:24.485 --> 41:25.985
she shouldn't have to go through it alone.

41:26.020 --> 41:28.188
Yes, well, I've tried. She won't let me in.

41:28.222 --> 41:30.590
Then quit asking permission.

41:32.826 --> 41:34.861
I lost my wife

41:34.895 --> 41:38.331
'cause I wasn't man enough to
put her needs ahead of mine.

41:38.366 --> 41:39.699
Don't make the same mistake.

41:42.202 --> 41:44.636
You know what, Slaughter?

41:44.671 --> 41:46.638
For all your bluster and bravado,

41:46.673 --> 41:49.908
you're actually a wise and,
dare I say, sensitive...

41:49.943 --> 41:52.144
Whoa! Hey! Stop right there.

41:52.179 --> 41:55.147
Only <i>you</i> could take
two guys talking about a chick

41:55.182 --> 41:56.715
and make it weird.

41:56.749 --> 41:58.184
Sorry.

41:58.218 --> 41:59.685
Yeah. Me too.

41:59.719 --> 42:01.053
Every time.

42:03.123 --> 42:03.989
Thank you.

42:04.023 --> 42:06.459
[Snaps fingers] Whatever, Sherlock.
