YOU CAN STOP
APOLOGIZING, SPUD.

20:50.249 --> 20:55.988
I WANT YOU GUYS TO KNOW
THAT I PROMISE TO NEVER,
EVER LET JEALOUSY GET

20:55.988 --> 20:57.522
THE BETTER OF ME AGAIN.

20:57.522 --> 20:59.157
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

20:59.157 --> 21:03.428
WHILE WE'RE SPREADING
THE "I'M SORRIES"
ALL AROUND HERE,

21:03.428 --> 21:05.964
DON'T YOU HAVE SOMETHING
YOU NEED TO SAY TO ME?

21:05.964 --> 21:07.532
Jake: YEAH. I'VE GOT
TO STAY IN SHAPE.

21:07.532 --> 21:10.535
GOOD-BYE, JUNK FOOD,
AND WELCOME HOME,
HEALTHY EATING.

21:10.535 --> 21:12.170
AND EXERCISING?

21:12.170 --> 21:16.141
GOOD, BECAUSE
DANCING IS
GREAT EXERCISE.

21:16.141 --> 21:18.377
LOOK, I KNOW
YOU SNAPPED OUT
OF LIKING ME,

21:18.377 --> 21:20.279
SO YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DUMP ME.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.414
JUST GO AHEAD AND BE
WITH NIGEL.

21:22.414 --> 21:24.349
OK. I KNOW WHO I LIKE,
POTATO BOY,

21:24.349 --> 21:27.052
AND I TOLD YOU,
IT'S, LIKE, YOU.

21:27.052 --> 21:30.455
YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE
TO GET USED TO HIM, TUMMY.

21:30.455 --> 21:33.325
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO ACT LIKE
THAT ANYMORE,

21:33.325 --> 21:35.861
BECAUSE
YOU'RE NOT BEING
MIND CONTR--WAIT.

21:35.861 --> 21:37.162
YOU REALLY LIKE ME?

21:37.162 --> 21:39.264
FURY LIED
ABOUT THIS, TOO?

21:39.264 --> 21:40.499
♪ AWESOME ♪

21:40.499 --> 21:43.335
I HEARD YOU PLANNED
THIS DANCE FOR ME.

21:43.335 --> 21:45.203
YEAH. STUPID, HUH?

21:45.203 --> 21:47.839
WELL, ARE WE GONNA
DANCE OR NOT?

21:47.839 --> 21:49.174
HECK YEAH, WE ARE!

21:49.174 --> 21:51.877
HELLO! I CAN'T
BE SEEN WITH YOU.

21:51.877 --> 21:53.945
OH. RIGHT.

21:54.813 --> 22:05.390
[SONG PLAYING]

22:09.328 --> 22:13.231
MAN, WHO CARES IF
IT DIDN'T WORK
OUT WITH STACY?

22:13.231 --> 22:15.467
Trixie: YEAH. SHE
DOESN'T DESERVE YOU.

22:15.467 --> 22:19.871
SHAKIN' HER NO-RHYTHM BOOTY
UP ON TOP OF A PYRAMID.

22:19.871 --> 22:22.407
YO, SPUD, BETTER
DRY YOUR EYES
AND COME OUT.

22:22.407 --> 22:23.542
ROTWOOD'S COMING.

22:23.542 --> 22:24.876
Jake, as Rotwood:
MARK MY BALD SPOT!

22:24.876 --> 22:27.446
COME OUT OF HERE
OR YOU WILL BE
SUSPENDED.

22:27.446 --> 22:28.914
SCHNAKEN-HOSEN.

22:28.914 --> 22:30.015
OK, THAT WAS
STILL ME.

22:30.015 --> 22:31.516
BUT, SERIOUSLY,
THE MOPS ARE
IN THERE,

22:31.516 --> 22:33.952
AND WE JUST
WANT TO CLEAN UP
AND GO HOME.

22:33.952 --> 22:34.986
SPUDINSKI!

22:34.986 --> 22:36.488
SPUD, COME ON, MAN!

22:36.488 --> 22:37.556
SPUD!
