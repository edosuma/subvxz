I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS
MOMENT FOR A LONG TIME.

03:02.782 --> 03:10.256
I MEAN, WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
THAT A GIRL FROM MARYLAND WOULD

03:10.323 --> 03:13.626
GET PLUCKED OUT OF TACOMA PARK
INTO THE "BIG BROTHER" HOUSE TO

03:13.693 --> 03:15.361

THE FACT THAT I'M GOING TO BE
SITTING AT FINALE NIGHT IS

03:34.314 --> 03:34.881
AMAZING.

03:34.948 --> 03:36.783

I CAN SEE IT.

03:39.552 --> 03:41.521
AND I WANT IT.

03:41.588 --> 03:45.525
IT WAS A VERY HARD DECISION TO
EVICT KYLAND.

03:45.592 --> 03:47.860
BUT IT'S A GAME MOVE.

03:47.927 --> 03:52.198

IT'S BEEN MENTALLY, EMOTIONALLY,
PHYSICALLY EXHAUSTING, BUT THE

04:39.379 --> 04:41.247

04:41.314 --> 04:44.884
I CAME HERE TO PLAY A GAME AND
I'M NOT DONE PLAYING.

04:44.951 --> 04:52.558

I MISS MY GOLDEN DOODLE
CHRISTIAN.

08:29.508 --> 08:32.511
BECAUSE OF THE GAME, WE HAD TO
SEND CHRISTIAN HOME.

08:32.578 --> 08:35.214
OTHERWISE I WOULD HAVE HAD AN
AMAZING TIME HANGING OUT WITH

BEAR OR LION?

08:45.124 --> 08:45.758
>> LION.

08:45.825 --> 08:47.460

08:47.526 --> 08:50.997
>> SO THEN LION OR LIGGER?

08:51.063 --> 08:52.198
>> HUH?

08:52.265 --> 08:52.865
>> LIGGER.

08:52.932 --> 08:54.667
>> IS THAT AN ACTUAL SPECIES?

08:54.734 --> 08:55.368
>> IT IS.

08:55.434 --> 08:58.170
>> YOU HAVEN'T HEARD OF A LIGER?

08:58.237 --> 08:58.738
>> NO.

08:58.804 --> 09:01.774
>> NO, LIGER'S ARE REAL.

09:01.841 --> 09:08.915
IT'S THE SAME THIENG WHAT IS THE
ZEBRA, THE SCREEN RADONKEY,

09:08.981 --> 09:09.482
ZONKEY.

09:09.548 --> 09:10.650

HIS MOUTH, I'M ALREADY LIKE,

09:13.886 --> 09:15.154
OKAY.

09:15.221 --> 09:16.322
I HAVE A HEADACHE.

09:16.389 --> 09:21.260
I KIND OF BELIEVE THAT A LION
AND A TIGER COULD PRODUCE A

09:21.327 --> 09:25.965
LIGER, BUT THERE'S NO WAY THAT
SCREEN RADONKEYS ARE REAL.

09:26.032 --> 09:28.567
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO WAY.

09:28.634 --> 09:29.769
>> ZONKEYS ARE REAL.

09:29.835 --> 09:32.605
ARE ZONKEYS REAL?

09:32.672 --> 09:34.006
>> I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE.

09:34.073 --> 09:37.777
THEY'RE LIKE A LIGER, A TIGER
AND A LION.

09:37.843 --> 09:40.379
YOU GUYS SOUND REAL DUMB TO
AMERICA RIGHT NOW.

09:40.446 --> 09:42.782
I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS MY
ANIMALS.

09:42.848 --> 09:43.449
OH, MY GOD!

09:43.516 --> 09:44.483
THOSE ARE REAL.

31:01.359 --> 31:04.796
THE DISCIPLINED NATURE THAT YOU
HAVE AND THE MATURITY LEVEL YOU

31:04.862 --> 31:12.036
HAVE TELLS ME THAT YOU ARE MORE
THAN WHAT YOU LET ON.

31:12.103 --> 31:13.938
AND I AM OKAY WITH THAT.

31:14.005 --> 31:18.076
IF HE IS A BARTENDER, HE SHOULD
PROBABLY FIND ANOTHER

31:18.142 --> 31:18.776
PROFESSION.

31:18.843 --> 31:21.646
>> WHY Y'ALL THINK I'M SO SMART?

31:21.713 --> 31:23.715
>> YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ANY
DRINKS.

31:23.781 --> 31:25.183
>> YES, I'M A LAWYER.

31:25.250 --> 31:26.251
YOU FIGURED IT OUT.

31:26.317 --> 31:27.352
YOU DID GREAT.

31:27.418 --> 31:28.286
GOOD FOR YOU.

31:28.353 --> 31:31.389
BUT YOU CAN'T TELL PEOPLE THAT
I'M A LAWYER.

31:31.456 --> 31:32.257
JUST STAY QUIET.

31:32.323 --> 31:34.025
WE CAN DISCUSS IT LATER.

31:34.092 --> 31:38.263
>> YOU MIGHT FOOL THEM, AND I
WILL NEVER TELL.

31:38.329 --> 31:42.634
BUT YOU DON'T FOOL ME.

31:42.700 --> 31:46.104
>> IT'S CRAZY THAT, YOU KNOW,
ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE GONE, BUT,

31:46.170 --> 31:48.339
YOU KNOW, WE ARE GOING TO SEE
SOME OF THEM SOON.

31:48.406 --> 31:51.142
>> I'M GOING TO MISS SO MANY
THINGS ABOUT THIS HOUSE,

31:51.209 --> 31:54.212
ESPECIALLY GOING INTO THE DIARY
ROOM AND GETTING TO REQUEST

31:54.279 --> 31:54.512
STUFF.

31:54.579 --> 31:55.647
>> AHH.

31:55.713 --> 31:57.949
>> THAT'S DEFINITELY AN
UNDERRATED PERK OF BEING IN THE

31:58.016 --> 31:58.549
"BIG BROTHER" HOUSE.

31:58.616 --> 31:59.817
>> I'M GOING TO MISS THAT.

31:59.884 --> 32:04.088
I HAVE TO MAKE A DIARY ROOM AT
HOME.

32:04.155 --> 32:05.256
>> I HAVE A QUESTION.

32:05.323 --> 32:09.193
I HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO TALK
ABOUT, BUT I JUST WANT TO ASK

32:09.260 --> 32:09.794
SOME QUESTIONS.

32:09.861 --> 32:10.862
>> I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS.

32:10.928 --> 32:13.364
>> CAN I MAKE A COUPLE OF
REQUESTS BEFORE I FORGET?

32:13.431 --> 32:15.233
>> I DID HAVE A REQUEST, IF
THAT'S OKAY.

32:15.300 --> 32:18.436
>> I CAME IN HERE TO PUT IN SOME
REQUESTS.

32:18.503 --> 32:21.105
>> WHY WAS I THE SECRETARY TODAY
FOR EVERYBODY?

32:21.172 --> 32:26.077
>> HEY, ONE QUESTION, ARE YOU
STILL THERE?

32:26.144 --> 32:26.711
IS ANYONE THERE?

32:26.778 --> 32:31.382
>> MAY I HAVE SOME CAT FISH?

32:31.449 --> 32:32.583
PLEASE.

32:32.650 --> 32:35.620
>> WE STILL CANNOT GET RID OF
THE FISH SMELL IN THE FRIDGE.

32:35.687 --> 32:43.928
>> IT'S LIKE MY TWO-YEAR
ALLERGY-AVERSARY, KIND OF THING.

32:43.995 --> 32:48.299
AND I DIDN'T KNOW IF I WOULD BE
ABLE TO REQUEST A GLUTEN-FREE

32:48.366 --> 32:48.933
CAKE.

32:49.000 --> 32:52.403
>> CAN I REQUEST SOME BREAD?

32:52.470 --> 32:54.639
>> COOKIES, OREOS ARE GOOD.

32:54.706 --> 32:55.573
>> NO CHOCOLATE.

32:55.640 --> 32:58.609
>> AS MUCH BREAD AS THEY CAN
BRING.

32:58.676 --> 33:02.847
>> ON MULTIPLE BREAD AND
TORTILLA ITEMS WE NOTICED

33:02.914 --> 33:05.216
RANDOMLY THERE WOULD BE A SOAPY
TASTE.

33:05.283 --> 33:08.386
>> WE LITERALLY HAVE ANTS ALL
OVER THE COUCH.

33:08.453 --> 33:15.259
>> I WAS WONDERING IF WE COULD
GET SOME ANT SPRAY.

33:15.326 --> 33:17.028
>> AND ON THE WALLS.

33:17.095 --> 33:20.631
>> APPARENTLY THERE WERE SOME
ANTS LAST NIGHT, AND DIG "B"

33:20.698 --> 33:21.632
THREW THEM AWAY.

33:21.699 --> 33:24.001
>> WE'RE HAVING A LITTLE BIT OF
AN ANT PROBLEM.

33:24.068 --> 33:27.338
>> CAN I REQUEST SOME
COMBINATION OF A BUCKET HAT,

33:27.405 --> 33:28.573
SWEATSHIRT, AND SWEAT PANTS?

33:28.639 --> 33:31.909
>> I DIDN'T GET A HOODIE, AND
THE NEXT THREE PEOPLE AFTER ALL

33:31.976 --> 33:35.046
KNOT HOODIES AND NONE OF THEM
ASKED FOR A HOODIE AND I WAS

33:35.113 --> 33:36.881
LIKE, THESE ARE MY HOODIES.

33:36.948 --> 33:39.050
>> I WOULD LOVE A HOODIE.

33:39.117 --> 33:40.818
>> ACNE PIMPLE PATCHES.

33:40.885 --> 33:42.019
MY FAVORITE.

33:42.086 --> 33:45.923
>> ARE WE ABLE TO GET STRAWS SO
WE CAN MAKE FAKE COCKTAILS.

33:45.990 --> 33:47.458
>> UM, MAYBE THAT'S IT FOR NOW.

33:47.525 --> 33:48.626
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH!

33:48.693 --> 33:49.360
HAVE A GREAT DAY!

33:54.766 --> 34:01.606
>> I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE I'M HERE
AND WE'RE HERE.

34:01.672 --> 34:04.108
>> GOSH, MEMORIES OF THE
COOKOUT.

34:04.175 --> 34:05.910
TIFFANY, HANNAH, KYLAND,.

34:05.977 --> 34:08.012
>> THE COOKOUT WAS SOMETHING
BIGGER.

34:08.079 --> 34:12.817
IT WAS A CONNECTION OF SHARED
EXPERIENCES THAT WE ALL HAD

34:12.884 --> 34:14.085
OUTSIDE.

34:14.152 --> 34:18.656
AND NOW WE'RE HERE, AND EVEN IF
IT WASN'T US, IF ONE OF US MADE

34:18.723 --> 34:19.590
IT, WE ALL DID.

34:19.657 --> 34:20.458
>> AMEN.

34:20.525 --> 34:22.260
>> WE HAD A GOAL AND WE
ACCOMPLISHED IT.

34:22.326 --> 34:25.062
WE NOT ONLY REPRESENT THE
COOKOUT, BUT WE REPRESENT THE

34:25.129 --> 34:25.696
WHOLE BLACK COMMUNITY.

34:25.763 --> 34:27.265
WE MADE HISTORY THIS SEASON.

34:27.331 --> 34:29.300
AND IT'S PRETTY INCREDIBLE.

34:29.367 --> 34:33.738
>> YES.

34:33.805 --> 34:38.976
>> I COME FROM A PREDOMINANTLY
WHITE COMMUNITY, SO I WENT TO A

34:39.043 --> 34:40.077
PREDOMINANTLY WHITE SCHOOL.

34:40.144 --> 34:42.713
AND PEOPLE HAVE CALLED ME
UNCIVILLIZED BECAUSE OF THE

34:42.780 --> 34:44.949
COUNTRY MY MOM COMES FROM, SOUTH
AFRICA.

34:45.016 --> 34:50.421
PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME HOW WE HAVE
RUNNING WATER IN OUR HOME IN

34:50.488 --> 34:51.923
NAPIERVILLE, ILLINOIS, A SUBURB
OF CHICAGO.

34:51.989 --> 34:54.926
>> BEING HERE, I'M VERY MINDFUL
OF WHO I REPRESENT, AND WITH

34:54.992 --> 35:00.364
BEING BLACK, THERE'S DEFINITELY
A SENSE SOLIDARITY AND

35:00.431 --> 35:02.600
CAMARADERIE THERE, AND THAT'S
ONE OF THE THINGS I CHERISH

35:02.667 --> 35:04.469
MOMENT ABOUT MY CULTURE AND MY
IDENTITY.

35:04.535 --> 35:09.907
>> I USED TO PULL MY SON OUT OF
CLASS BECAUSE HE HAS GONE TO

35:09.974 --> 35:10.508
PREDOMINANTLY WHITE SCHOOLS.

35:10.575 --> 35:11.709
HE FEELS LEFT OUT.

35:11.776 --> 35:15.213
LIKE, HE STANDS OUT WHEN HE JUST
WANTS TO BLEND IN SOMETIMES.

35:15.279 --> 35:19.584
>> I'VE BEEN IN THAT SITUATION,
WHERE, YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN THE

35:19.650 --> 35:24.021
ONLY BLACK ONE IN HISTORY CLASS
WHEN WE'RE GOING OVER SLAVERY.

35:24.088 --> 35:26.724
>> WHEN I SWITCHED SCHOOLS, I
WENT TO THE NICER, WHITER

35:26.791 --> 35:27.758
SCHOOL.

35:27.825 --> 35:31.329
THE FIRST FEW MONTHS I GOT
JUMPED BY THE NAZI KIDS.

35:31.395 --> 35:34.665
BUT I REMEMBER IT WAS JUST THE
BLACK KIDS HELPING ME WITH THE

35:34.732 --> 35:36.868
PROBLEMS I WAS HAVING WITH SOME
WHITE KIDS AT THAT SCHOOL.

35:36.934 --> 35:38.402
>> CAN I ASK A QUESTION?

35:38.469 --> 35:40.671
DID YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH TWO
WORDS?

35:40.738 --> 35:42.940
>> DID THEY CALL YOU A HISPANIC
SLUR?

35:43.007 --> 35:45.776
>> THE WORLD ONLY IDENTIFIES ME
AS BLACK IN AMERICA.

35:45.843 --> 35:51.782
SO I DON'T EXPERIENCE
SPECIFICALLY ANY SORT OF

35:51.849 --> 35:52.250
LATINO-RELATED RACISM.

35:52.316 --> 35:53.417
>> OKAY.

35:53.484 --> 35:58.189
>> EXCEPT FOR THE OTHERRIZING
WITHIN THE BLACK COMMUNITY.

35:58.256 --> 36:02.760
GROWING UP IT WAS-- BECAUSE I
READ AND I'M LEARNING.

36:02.827 --> 36:03.861
I'M LEARNING THE HISTORY.

36:03.928 --> 36:06.731
>> PEOPLE SAYING YOU'RE THE
WHITEST BLACK GUY I KNEW.

36:06.797 --> 36:08.966
BUT YOU'RE SAYING THAT BECAUSE
WHAT?

36:09.033 --> 36:10.334
BECAUSE I'M ARTICULATE?

36:10.401 --> 36:13.604
BECAUSE I'M WELL SPOKEN?

36:13.671 --> 36:15.506
BECAUSE I'M EDUCATED?

36:15.573 --> 36:20.711
>> IT IS SO INSULTING WHEN
SOMEONE IS LIKE, "YOU'RE SO

36:20.778 --> 36:21.946
ARTICULATE."

36:22.013 --> 36:25.750
>> I HAVE HAD SOMEONE TELL ME
YOU'RE WELL SPOKEN, ARTICULATE,

36:25.816 --> 36:27.184
AND PRETTY FOR A BLACK GIRL.

36:27.251 --> 36:31.255
OR PEOPLE WILL TELL ME I'M TOO
WHITE TO BE BLARK TOO BLACK TO

36:31.322 --> 36:32.290
BE INDIAN.

36:32.356 --> 36:32.924
YEAH.

36:32.990 --> 36:35.059
>> IT'S A MESS, IT'S A MESS.

36:35.126 --> 36:37.795
>> I WAS TELLING PEOPLE ABOUT
GOING TO PEPPERDINE, AND I HAD

36:37.862 --> 36:40.665
PEOPLE ASKING, ," WHAT SPORT DO
YOU PLAY?"

36:40.731 --> 36:41.265
>> ALL RIGHT.

36:41.332 --> 36:43.734
>> I'M A GOLFER.

36:43.801 --> 36:46.237
>> I'M LIKE, I ACTUALLY PLAY
CRICKET.

36:46.304 --> 36:48.506
>> LOOK HOW COOL THE DIVERSITY
IS AT THIS TABLE.

36:48.573 --> 36:49.707
>> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

36:49.774 --> 36:53.077
>> NOT EVEN IN TERMS OF BEING
MIXED BUT JUST IN TERMS OF NOT

36:53.144 --> 36:54.979
LOOKING AT BLACK AS A MONOLITH.

36:55.046 --> 36:58.249
>> I'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT A LOT
OF TIMES I FEEL LIKE SOCIETY HAS

36:58.316 --> 37:01.519
CAST BLACK AS ONE THING, AND
SOCIETY DOESN'T REALLY REALIZE

37:01.586 --> 37:04.055
THAT THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT
SHADES OF BLACK.

37:04.121 --> 37:07.959
>>ENING WE'RE BETTER NOW,
THOUGH, THAN WE WERE, PROBABLY

37:08.025 --> 37:09.794
WHEN WE WERE ALL GROWING UP.

37:09.860 --> 37:16.867
I THINK THAT THINGS ARE SO MUCH
MORE OPEN TO UNDERSTANDING

37:16.934 --> 37:18.102
THINGS.

37:18.169 --> 37:20.237
WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO,
BUT I THINK WE'RE GOING IN THE

37:20.304 --> 37:20.671
RIGHT PATH.

37:20.738 --> 37:21.839
>> THIS IS TRUE.

37:21.906 --> 37:25.142
>> AND, YOU KNOW, THINGS THAT
USED TO JUST BE THIS, WE'RE

37:25.209 --> 37:29.580
GETTING MORE DIVERSIFIED, I
THINK, BY THE YEAR.

37:29.647 --> 37:32.550
IF WE, YOU KNOW, STICK TOGETHER,
LIKE WE HAVE BEEN DOING

37:32.617 --> 37:35.186
THROUGHOUT YEARS, THINGS CAN
ONLY GET BETTER FROM HERE.

37:35.252 --> 37:38.689
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T-- YOU CAN'T
BREAK A BLACK COMMUNITY.

37:38.756 --> 37:39.624
YOU CAN'T.

37:39.690 --> 37:41.325
>> COULDN'T BREAK THIS ONE.

37:46.697 --> 37:48.032
>> OH, YAY!

37:48.099 --> 37:52.403
>> IT SAYS "FINAL THREE."

37:52.470 --> 37:54.305
LET'S SEE WHAT'S INSIDE.

37:54.372 --> 37:59.010
SEE WHAT THIS SAYS.

37:59.076 --> 38:02.580
"CONGRATULATIONS ON MAKING IT TO
FINAL THREE."

38:02.647 --> 38:05.416
>> YAY!

38:05.483 --> 38:08.319
"BEFORE YOU BATTLE IT OUT TO THE
END, "BIG BROTHER" WANTED TO

38:08.386 --> 38:10.855
PROVIDE YOU WITH SOME EXTRA
MOTIVATION.

38:10.921 --> 38:12.223
TAKE A LOOK AT THE MONITOR."

38:12.289 --> 38:15.326
>> OH, MY GOD I CAN'T.

38:15.393 --> 38:16.060
OH, MY GOD, I CAN'T.

38:16.127 --> 38:18.562
>> NO WAY.

38:18.629 --> 38:20.965
>> HI, DEREK, IT'S ME YOUR MOM.

38:21.032 --> 38:21.499
I LOVE YOU.

38:21.565 --> 38:22.433
I MISS YOU.

38:22.500 --> 38:24.335
I AM SO PROUD OF YOU.

38:24.402 --> 38:32.910
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT
FATHER GOD IN HEAVEN GOT YOUR

38:32.977 --> 38:34.145
BACK.

38:34.211 --> 38:39.016
AND I WANT YOU TO DO ONE THING
FOR ME-- STOP ALL THAT CUSSING.

38:39.083 --> 38:41.152
EVERYONE LOVE YOU, MISS YOU.

38:41.218 --> 38:44.021
TAKE CARE.

38:44.088 --> 38:47.358
>> I LOVE YOU, BIG "D"!

38:47.425 --> 38:49.393
>> OH!

38:49.460 --> 38:52.997
>> XAVIER, CONGRATULATIONS ON
MAKING IT THIS FAR.

38:53.064 --> 38:54.565
YOU'RE DOING SO AWESOME.

38:54.632 --> 38:56.701
>> HEY, BIG, BRO.

38:56.767 --> 38:58.102
I LOVE AND MISS YOU.

38:58.169 --> 39:01.338
JUST SO YOU KNOW I DID MOVE OUT
OF THE HOUSE NEAR CAMPUS, AND

39:01.405 --> 39:04.041
I'M SURE I'LL HAVE A BUNCH OF
STORIES TO TELL YOU WHEN YOU GET

39:04.108 --> 39:04.475
BACK.

39:04.542 --> 39:05.743
>> WE LOVE YOU.

39:05.810 --> 39:06.744
WE'RE PROUD OF YOU.

39:06.811 --> 39:08.612
AND KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE
DOING.

39:08.679 --> 39:09.080
ALL RIGHT.

39:09.146 --> 39:11.849
WE MISS YOU.

39:11.916 --> 39:14.151
>> HI, AZAH.

39:14.218 --> 39:15.786
HOW ARE YOU, MY BABY?

39:15.853 --> 39:17.188
I MISS YOU SO MUCH.

39:17.254 --> 39:19.490
AND I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

39:19.557 --> 39:25.096
AND YOU KNOW, YOU'RE THE BEST OF
MY FRIEND.

39:25.162 --> 39:28.399
AND YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE WHAT
IT TAKES TO WIN THIS.

39:28.466 --> 39:30.134
>> I WANT YOU TO KNOW ONE THING,
BABY.

39:30.201 --> 39:40.010
YOU HAVE DONE WHAT IT TAKES IN
THERE TO COME OUT AND WE'RE

39:40.077 --> 39:41.479
PROUD OF YOU.

39:41.545 --> 39:42.113
GOD BLESS YOU.

39:42.179 --> 39:44.882
>> I LOVE YOU, DADDY, MOMMY.

39:44.949 --> 39:48.352
>> OH!

39:48.419 --> 39:54.592
JUST TO GO THIS LONG AND NOT
HEAR FROM HER MEANS THE WORLD.

39:54.658 --> 39:55.226
OH!

39:55.292 --> 39:57.394
THANK YOU.

39:57.461 --> 39:58.529
OH, GOD.

39:58.596 --> 40:02.299
>> IT WAS SO INCREDIBLE BEING
ABLE TO SEE OUR FAMILIES.

40:02.366 --> 40:06.403
BUT IN ALL HONESTY, WE ALSO DID
HAVE AN INCREDIBLE SUMMER AS

40:06.470 --> 40:07.071
WELL.

40:07.138 --> 40:12.643
>> LET'S TOAST TO THIS SUMMER.

40:12.710 --> 40:16.147
GUYS, IN JUST A FEW DAYS, ONE OF
US WILL BE CROWNED THE WINNER OF

40:16.213 --> 40:20.518
"BIG BROTHER" SEASON 23 AND BE
WALKING AWAY WITH CAPITOL HILL

40:20.584 --> 40:21.685
750,000.

40:21.752 --> 40:24.722
>> AND SOMEBODY WILL BE WALKING
AWAY IN SECOND PLACE WITH

40:24.789 --> 40:25.790
$75,000.

40:25.856 --> 40:28.993
>> AND SOMEONE WALKING AWAY IN
THIRD WITH... NOTHING.

40:29.059 --> 40:32.963
>> SO, LET THE BEST HOUSEGUESTS
WIN.

40:33.030 --> 40:33.497
>> CHEERS.

40:33.564 --> 40:34.565
GOOD LUCK, YOU GUYS.

40:34.632 --> 40:38.602
>> GOOD LUCK.

40:40.638 --> 40:43.073
>> SEEING MY MOM, IT MEANT
EVERYTHING.

40:43.140 --> 40:46.477
IT MADE ME REALIZE WHY I'M HERE
AND WHO I'M FIGHTING FOR.

40:46.544 --> 40:48.179
I WANT TO MAKE MY MOM PROUD.

40:48.245 --> 40:51.615
I DEFINITELY DID NOT COME THIS
FAR TO WIN THIRD PLACE.

40:51.682 --> 40:56.353
I DEFINITELY DESERVE TO BE IN
THOSE FINAL TWO CHAIRS GOING FOR

40:56.420 --> 40:58.589
THAT GRAND PRIZE OF 750K.

40:58.656 --> 41:01.859
>> JUST SEEING THAT MESSAGE FROM
MY MOM AND DAD DOES LIGHT A FIRE

41:01.926 --> 41:02.560
IN ME.

41:02.626 --> 41:03.961
I WANT IT SO BAD.

41:04.028 --> 41:07.198
I AM SO CLOSE, I CAN TASTE IT.
