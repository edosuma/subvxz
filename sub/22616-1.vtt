<i>Traffic is heavy on the road</i>

03:40.176 --> 03:41.176
<i>to Los Angeles today.</i>

03:41.178 --> 03:43.979
<i>It's absolute Carmageddon
out there.</i>

03:43.981 --> 03:45.846
<i>The end of days sale...</i>

03:45.848 --> 03:47.582
<i>World
peace comes from realizing</i>

03:47.584 --> 03:49.184
<i>that we're all in this
together.</i>

03:49.186 --> 03:50.218
- Yes.
- <i>Every human being</i>

03:50.220 --> 03:51.521
<i>just wants to be loved...</i>

03:52.555 --> 03:54.289
<i>...and then uh,
the rest of it...</i>

03:54.291 --> 03:56.590
<i>And I'm one of these people
where we believe</i>

03:56.592 --> 03:58.893
<i>in this kind
of a more Western cumulative</i>

03:58.895 --> 04:01.161
<i>like your soul mate,

04:01.163 --> 04:02.199
I know!

04:02.201 --> 04:04.399
<i>...waiting for
a while. Like it's much more...</i>

04:04.401 --> 04:06.767
That's what I was saying, too!
I love it.

04:06.769 --> 04:09.803
<i>And so,
these two uh, points of view</i>

04:09.805 --> 04:12.773
<i>as well as many others exist
in the same space.</i>

04:16.946 --> 04:18.180
Hey, are you okay?

04:18.880 --> 04:20.814
He's got a decubitus ulcer
on the posterior

04:20.815 --> 04:22.751
aspect of his
left lower extremity.

04:22.753 --> 04:24.655
Full thickness skin loss.

04:26.722 --> 04:28.290
Ruthie, what was I supposed
to do?

04:28.292 --> 04:29.357
Call an ambulance.

04:29.359 --> 04:31.593
Definitely not put him
in your car and bring him

04:31.595 --> 04:33.694
to a financially strapped
women's hospital.

04:33.696 --> 04:35.763
Except when he's lying
on the curb

04:35.765 --> 04:37.299
and I see him as I'm driving by.

04:37.301 --> 04:39.734
Okay, well, Rach,
there's your problem.

04:39.736 --> 04:41.839
You should be texting
like everyone else.

04:42.573 --> 04:43.939
Give me that. Have fun.

04:43.941 --> 04:45.977
Thanks.

04:47.143 --> 04:48.545
Yeah?

04:49.712 --> 04:50.778
He's gonna be okay.

04:50.780 --> 04:54.915
Good, because Lord Haskill
wants to see you in 410.

04:54.917 --> 04:55.987
Oh, please.

05:07.698 --> 05:11.032
Look, Dan, I'm sorry,
but the guy was in need

05:11.034 --> 05:13.335
and that's what we do here,
right, we help people.

05:13.337 --> 05:14.970
And I understand
the financial realities

05:14.972 --> 05:17.739
of this clinic, I've even got
him on a transfer

05:17.741 --> 05:18.739
he's headed to County,

05:18.741 --> 05:20.641
- so there's no need...
- Rachel, Rachel.

05:20.643 --> 05:22.145
There's somebody here
to see you.

05:22.778 --> 05:24.614
Let me know
if you need anything.

05:28.150 --> 05:29.783
Dr. Rozman,

05:29.785 --> 05:31.955
I'm Jake Alshadi I work
for the US State Department.

05:32.655 --> 05:34.388
I'm afraid I have some
difficult news.

05:34.390 --> 05:35.760
You wanna sit?

05:36.760 --> 05:38.663
Uh, no, I think I'll stand.

05:40.097 --> 05:41.862
It's about your brother, David.

05:41.864 --> 05:43.900
I'm sorry, Dr. Rozman,
he passed away.

05:48.838 --> 05:50.941
Can I get you some water?
Something?

05:58.814 --> 06:00.785
I haven't seen him
in three years.

06:04.821 --> 06:06.991
- Where is he?
- Amman, Jordan.

06:08.691 --> 06:11.725
In this kind of situation,
a family member usually

06:11.727 --> 06:13.227
goes overseas to identify the...

06:13.229 --> 06:14.963
In what kind of a situation?

06:14.965 --> 06:17.732
When an American citizen
dies on foreign soil.

06:17.734 --> 06:19.900
I understand you're his
nearest relative?

06:19.902 --> 06:20.871
Yeah...

06:21.804 --> 06:23.874
I'm his only relative, um...

06:24.775 --> 06:26.408
I can take you to him.

06:26.410 --> 06:28.179
There's a flight
for Amman tonight.

06:29.979 --> 06:31.015
Okay.

06:31.948 --> 06:33.818
- I'll be right outside.
- Mm-hmm.

06:37.453 --> 06:39.853
<i>It's gonna be hot,
super-hot.</i>

06:39.855 --> 06:41.989
Thirty-seven degrees Celsius.

06:41.991 --> 06:44.292
That's almost 100 for us,
Fahrenheit.

06:44.294 --> 06:46.797
I don't even know what to take
to something like this.

06:51.068 --> 06:55.906
So, um, how come, you know,
you didn't see him for so long?

06:57.907 --> 07:00.908
I don't know, um,

07:00.910 --> 07:04.278
I mean, he lived over there
and I lived over here.

07:04.280 --> 07:07.717
Just work, you know, life.

07:09.186 --> 07:11.720
Anyway, you remember the drill
about the cats, right?

07:11.722 --> 07:13.487
Yep, twice a day.

07:13.489 --> 07:14.655
Fuzzy gets wet food
in the morning

07:14.657 --> 07:18.326
and Zam gets dry because,
you know, he's a real fatty.

07:18.328 --> 07:19.929
And don't forget
the fresh water.

07:20.463 --> 07:22.966
Don't worry about Fuzzy
and Zam, Rachel, okay?

07:23.366 --> 07:24.965
I can even do my homework
over here.

07:24.967 --> 07:26.300
I'll take good care of them.

07:26.302 --> 07:28.302
I know you will, you're awesome.

07:28.304 --> 07:29.737
- I'm gonna miss you.
- Thank you.

07:31.140 --> 07:32.473
I think that's your mom.

07:32.475 --> 07:33.943
- Ready?
- Yep.

07:53.395 --> 07:54.831
Do you wanna talk?

07:57.066 --> 07:58.134
No.

08:07.010 --> 08:08.079
He was smart,

08:08.811 --> 08:11.478
David, he was so smart.

08:11.480 --> 08:12.850
And he was really curious.

08:15.251 --> 08:17.020
Kind of obsessive, actually.

08:17.453 --> 08:19.119
Loved digging for things.

08:19.121 --> 08:21.225
Always wanted to be
an archaeologist.

08:22.926 --> 08:24.992
And he worked freelance
for a while

08:24.994 --> 08:25.960
and then he moved
to the Middle East

08:25.962 --> 08:28.095
because there were digging jobs
over there,

08:28.097 --> 08:29.133
but he was...

08:30.566 --> 08:33.104
naive, you know, he was an
idealist.

08:34.503 --> 08:35.837
What'd he dig for?

08:35.839 --> 08:38.241
Religious objects and artifacts.

08:39.042 --> 08:40.573
He was
kind of a treasure hunter.

08:40.576 --> 08:42.046
Indiana Jones?

08:43.580 --> 08:46.216
That's what he sounds
like to this desk jockey.

08:56.091 --> 08:58.095
<i>Have you ever been
to the Middle East before?</i>

08:58.894 --> 09:00.428
It can be a lot to take
in at first.

09:00.430 --> 09:01.563
Yeah.

09:01.565 --> 09:03.164
I was born here.

09:03.166 --> 09:05.268
- Moved to Ohio when I was a kid.
- Oh.

09:06.235 --> 09:09.172
Part Mid-East, part Mid-West,
so, no worries.

09:10.540 --> 09:12.042
I wasn't really worried.

09:20.917 --> 09:23.186
There's no rush.
Take all the time you need.

09:25.855 --> 09:27.191
Jake, hold up!

09:27.590 --> 09:28.859
Dr. Rozman,

09:28.861 --> 09:31.425
Excuse me, I'm afraid
there's been a complication.

09:31.427 --> 09:32.626
Sorry to blindside you
with this,

09:32.628 --> 09:35.365
- I just found out myself.
- What kind of a complication?

09:36.899 --> 09:39.067
The Jordanians are holding
onto the body.

09:39.069 --> 09:42.402
They're looking into possible
illegal activities.

09:42.404 --> 09:44.304
- The theft of antiquities.
- What?

09:44.306 --> 09:47.507
And conspiracy to transport
objects of cultural heritage

09:47.509 --> 09:49.179
across international borders.

09:50.346 --> 09:52.015
Those are serious crimes.

09:52.449 --> 09:53.950
The Ministry is upset.

09:55.351 --> 09:57.551
Do you happen to know
if your brother was

09:57.553 --> 10:00.354
- part of any religious sect or...
- He was Jewish,

10:00.356 --> 10:03.290
if that's what you mean.
Who... who are you?

10:03.292 --> 10:05.325
I'm sorry. Conrad Hanley,

10:05.327 --> 10:07.628
Special AttachÃ©
with the American Embassy

10:07.630 --> 10:08.997
here in Amman.

10:08.999 --> 10:10.464
The police just have some
questions...

10:10.466 --> 10:11.366
She's a guest of State.

10:11.368 --> 10:12.967
They have no right
to interrogate her.

10:12.969 --> 10:15.439
Interrogate? For what?

10:16.406 --> 10:18.876
Your brother was handcuffed
to his steering wheel...

10:19.475 --> 10:21.378
abandoned in the desert heat.

10:22.144 --> 10:23.980
Notice the front tires
were shot out.

10:24.446 --> 10:26.647
This wasn't an accident,
he was left there by somebody.

10:26.649 --> 10:28.683
Do you know,
why he was wearing a tuxedo?

10:28.685 --> 10:30.050
I have no idea.

10:30.052 --> 10:31.120
<i>Your brother's cell phone,</i>

10:31.122 --> 10:33.256
<i>unfortunately there
was no signal in the desert.</i>

10:33.956 --> 10:36.224
<i>He called you on April 9th?</i>

10:37.661 --> 10:39.496
- <i>Yes.</i>
- <i>What did you talk about?</i>

10:39.995 --> 10:44.198
He called me for my birthday,
just wanted to say hello.

10:46.002 --> 10:47.972
Did he mention
what he was doing here?

10:48.537 --> 10:50.570
Did he seem excited, scared?

10:50.572 --> 10:52.008
Dr. Rozman...

10:52.642 --> 10:55.012
do you know the name,
Charles Du Plessis?

10:56.412 --> 10:57.978
No, should I?

10:57.980 --> 11:01.616
Eccentric French millionaire,
lives in Dubai.

11:01.618 --> 11:04.484
- I don't know anybody in Dubai.
- Really?

11:04.486 --> 11:07.156
He was the last person your
brother tried to call.

11:07.657 --> 11:09.723
Du Plessis is a collector
and your brother

11:09.725 --> 11:11.027
was a kind of a...

11:11.617 --> 11:14.161
- mercenary archaeologist.
- My brother liked to find things

11:14.163 --> 11:15.463
they were knick-knacks
he wasn't...

11:15.465 --> 11:17.598
Stolen knick-knacks?
Dr. Rozman,

11:17.600 --> 11:20.034
the smuggling of antiquities
is a lucrative

11:20.036 --> 11:21.405
and nasty business.

11:22.037 --> 11:24.738
If this was my brother
and someone had just shown me

11:24.740 --> 11:26.440
what we have shown you,

11:26.442 --> 11:28.041
I would do everything I could...

11:28.043 --> 11:30.047
So you think that I know
why this happened to him?

11:31.214 --> 11:34.385
Did he ever mention
any business associates?

11:35.018 --> 11:36.516
- Friends?
- No.

11:36.518 --> 11:38.586
- Enemies?
- No!

11:38.588 --> 11:40.387
Now, can I go, please?

11:40.389 --> 11:41.424
<i>Not yet.</i>

11:42.524 --> 11:44.324
<i>One more photograph.</i>

11:44.326 --> 11:47.462
Your brother carved this
in his left arm.

11:47.464 --> 11:50.464
- I don't need to see this...
- He did this to himself...

11:50.466 --> 11:52.135
- No!
- We recovered his knife!

12:02.412 --> 12:05.349
<i>Look, this may be
very important.</i>

12:06.048 --> 12:08.716
We believe it's a message,
your brother was trapped

12:08.718 --> 12:11.251
he was dehydrated
and he knew he was dying.

12:11.253 --> 12:13.621
So, in a sense,
this was like his last word.

12:13.623 --> 12:15.522
Is it a symbol, is it a map?

12:15.524 --> 12:17.125
It must mean something.

12:17.127 --> 12:19.260
- I don't know!
- Take a good look!

12:19.262 --> 12:20.361
<i>I don't know.</i>

12:27.537 --> 12:28.571
I'm sorry.

12:29.572 --> 12:32.506
Why? You didn't have anything
to do with that?

12:32.508 --> 12:33.509
You doing okay?

12:35.077 --> 12:37.013
Can I see my brother's body now?

12:38.380 --> 12:39.515
Of course.

12:40.483 --> 12:41.518
This way.

12:51.326 --> 12:53.194
They're keeping the body
for now,

12:53.196 --> 12:54.630
which gives us some leverage.

12:55.264 --> 12:56.830
You think she's one of them?

12:56.832 --> 12:58.799
No, no way.

12:58.801 --> 13:00.303
You can't go by looks.

13:01.071 --> 13:03.440
A lot of religious nut jobs
seem perfectly normal.

13:04.441 --> 13:05.542
My first wife.

13:08.143 --> 13:10.477
Next paycheck says she's
no cult member.

13:10.479 --> 13:11.846
How about her brother?

13:11.848 --> 13:14.181
Paycheck on him not being
a loony?

13:14.183 --> 13:15.248
Nope.

13:15.250 --> 13:17.053
No bets on the brother, but...

13:17.586 --> 13:18.654
she doesn't know anything.

13:19.721 --> 13:23.092
- All right. When's her flight?
- Tomorrow morning.

13:23.659 --> 13:25.528
Take her to her brother's hotel.

13:26.628 --> 13:28.032
Show her his room.

13:29.264 --> 13:30.633
Maybe something will click.

13:32.734 --> 13:34.734
They're holding
his body hostage.

13:34.736 --> 13:36.304
It's a criminal investigation.

13:36.306 --> 13:37.838
Governments get touchy
when the US

13:37.840 --> 13:39.609
starts meddling
in their affairs of State.

13:40.509 --> 13:42.709
It's also a tactic, they're
trying to put pressure on you.

13:42.711 --> 13:44.080
Why?

13:44.082 --> 13:47.415
- What do they think I know?
- A name, a number, an address.

13:47.417 --> 13:49.282
What the carving
on his arm means.

13:49.284 --> 13:50.620
They're looking for anything.

13:53.455 --> 13:54.490
He needed money.

13:56.459 --> 13:59.563
Okay, good, that's something.
Money for what?

14:02.398 --> 14:04.464
Rachel, did David say why
he needed money?

14:04.466 --> 14:06.233
He always needed money,

14:06.235 --> 14:08.202
he just... he wasn't very good
at being a grown-up.

14:08.204 --> 14:09.640
But did he say why this time?

14:12.475 --> 14:14.141
He just said that things
got weird

14:14.143 --> 14:15.709
and he needed to get
out of Jordan.

14:15.711 --> 14:16.746
To where?

14:16.748 --> 14:19.012
You know, if I had the answers
to your questions

14:19.014 --> 14:20.683
I wouldn't be sitting here
trying to answer your questions.

14:22.619 --> 14:24.253
Can you get his body released?

14:24.653 --> 14:26.687
I can't, it's not my place.

14:31.827 --> 14:33.529
<i>David Rozman's room, 702.</i>

14:34.263 --> 14:36.429
I'm so sorry, sir,
I can't do that.

14:36.431 --> 14:38.766
The seventh floor is off-limits
at the moment.

14:38.768 --> 14:40.537
It's impossible,
I can't help you.

14:42.471 --> 14:44.207
I'm sure there's something
you can do.

14:44.907 --> 14:46.375
US State Department...

14:47.643 --> 14:48.644
in Jordan.

14:50.180 --> 14:51.482
I still can't help you.

14:54.617 --> 14:55.652
Thank you.

14:57.787 --> 14:58.920
Hey.

15:02.624 --> 15:05.261
- What are you doing?
- Don't worry, I got this.

15:12.402 --> 15:14.434
Got a few tricks up my sleeve.

15:14.436 --> 15:15.438
Oh?

15:22.211 --> 15:23.544
Way to go there, desk jockey.

15:23.546 --> 15:25.415
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.

15:35.959 --> 15:37.724
The police did this?

15:37.726 --> 15:39.162
No.

15:39.696 --> 15:41.297
Somebody broke in afterwards.

16:07.489 --> 16:09.556
Keep closed,
keep them closed.

16:09.558 --> 16:10.958
Okay, open them up!

16:10.960 --> 16:12.892
Oh, David!

16:12.894 --> 16:14.463
Aren't they beautiful?

16:22.638 --> 16:24.207
Hey, look what I found.

16:24.740 --> 16:27.577
An invitation to an event
last week University of Jordan.

16:28.543 --> 16:29.579
You read Arabic?

16:30.812 --> 16:32.215
It's in English on the back.

16:34.617 --> 16:37.017
It's honoring
an archaeology professor,

16:37.019 --> 16:38.752
Abdul Rahman Al Ahmad.

16:38.754 --> 16:41.258
So, something that someone
might rent a tux for?

16:44.460 --> 16:47.497
Professor Al Ahmad,
thank you for meeting with us.

16:48.064 --> 16:50.631
I have only five minutes
before my lecture.

16:50.633 --> 16:52.632
You wanted to know
about David Rozman.

16:52.634 --> 16:53.769
Yes, he's my brother.

16:54.503 --> 16:56.672
Well, then you know him
better than I do.

16:57.540 --> 16:58.609
He's dead.

16:59.408 --> 17:01.375
Under highly suspicious
circumstances...

17:01.377 --> 17:02.943
Not that we think
you're involved in any way.

17:02.945 --> 17:04.645
Actually, we kind of do.

17:04.646 --> 17:07.380
We... we think that you
might know something.

17:07.382 --> 17:09.648
My brother, who never wore
a suit in his entire life

17:09.651 --> 17:12.051
rented a tuxedo in order
to go to your fundraiser

17:12.054 --> 17:13.321
before he died.

17:13.324 --> 17:15.170
He went straight from the party
to die out in the desert

17:15.172 --> 17:16.490
and we were hoping that you
might have some information

17:16.492 --> 17:17.862
as to how that could
have happened.

17:17.864 --> 17:19.327
So, how did you know
David Rozman?

17:19.329 --> 17:21.529
I met him, two weeks ago,
at the University.

17:21.531 --> 17:23.931
He insisted we meet again,
so I gave him a time

17:23.933 --> 17:25.765
to meet in my office.

17:25.767 --> 17:27.401
Next day he calls and says,

17:27.403 --> 17:29.740
he wants the meeting
in a public space.

17:30.372 --> 17:33.509
My office wouldn't do.
People were after him.

17:34.843 --> 17:37.280
He seemed unhinged,

17:38.513 --> 17:40.580
so, I suggested he come
to our fundraiser.

17:40.582 --> 17:42.383
And what did you talk about
at the party?

17:42.385 --> 17:44.484
I never saw Mr. Rozman.

17:44.486 --> 17:48.789
I was told he met with a woman.
She caused quite a scene.

17:48.791 --> 17:50.957
I'm sorry, Professor,
what kind of a scene?

17:50.959 --> 17:52.059
Who was this woman?

17:52.061 --> 17:54.865
I don't know,
she's a drunk foreigner.

17:55.598 --> 17:58.301
They left together.
Now, excuse me...

17:58.734 --> 18:00.600
it's time for my class.

18:00.602 --> 18:01.638
Um...

18:02.638 --> 18:04.805
I bet you there's a list,
for the fundraiser

18:04.807 --> 18:06.574
and that woman's name
is gonna be on it.

18:06.576 --> 18:07.778
I'm guessing lonely nights,

18:07.780 --> 18:11.145
watching <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> on TV
with ice cream and flannel PJs.

18:11.147 --> 18:14.415
First of all, nobody wears
flannel in Los Angeles

18:14.417 --> 18:15.950
and secondly,
a lot can be gleaned

18:15.952 --> 18:17.587
from watching <i>Sherlock Holmes.</i>

18:19.088 --> 18:20.924
- Can you get us a list?
- No.

18:22.692 --> 18:23.790
Why not?

18:23.792 --> 18:26.092
My job is to escort you
to ID your brother's body...

18:26.094 --> 18:27.508
- No, Jake...
- I'm not investigating a crime.

18:27.510 --> 18:29.963
They're not gonna release
his body if we don't find out

18:29.965 --> 18:32.133
what happened to him, you heard
them, people were after him.

18:32.135 --> 18:33.867
My job is also to keep you safe.

18:33.869 --> 18:38.138
- You're my responsibility.
- My brother wasn't unhinged!

18:38.140 --> 18:39.709
You haven't seen him
for three years.

18:44.914 --> 18:46.350
Okay, fine, what's next?

18:47.116 --> 18:48.982
- The airport hotel.
- What?

18:48.984 --> 18:50.451
Look, I'm sorry
about your brother

18:50.453 --> 18:52.051
but we're not here
to play detective.

18:52.053 --> 18:54.021
You're getting
on that plane tomorrow.

18:54.023 --> 18:55.889
I'm not putting you
in danger.

18:55.891 --> 18:57.157
I wanna stay at David's hotel.

18:57.159 --> 18:58.626
- No.
- Please!

18:58.628 --> 19:00.094
Please, I can feel him there

19:00.096 --> 19:01.729
and after tomorrow,
he's gonna be gone

19:01.731 --> 19:03.763
and maybe you
can't understand that...

19:03.765 --> 19:04.667
No!

19:05.534 --> 19:06.902
We're not here
in an official capacity.

19:07.837 --> 19:10.440
I'm sorry,
there are no rooms available.

19:11.573 --> 19:12.641
Um...

19:13.642 --> 19:15.978
we just need a place to stay.

19:19.014 --> 19:20.516
For one night.

19:23.186 --> 19:24.918
Queen-size bed?

19:24.920 --> 19:26.153
- Two rooms.
- Two rooms.

19:30.493 --> 19:33.159
- Sure you're gonna be okay?
- Yep, there's a pool,

19:33.161 --> 19:35.229
and I brought a swimsuit,
it helps me relax.

19:35.231 --> 19:36.700
Good, you do that, you relax.

19:37.199 --> 19:39.436
- Let the police do their work.
- Yep.

20:33.589 --> 20:34.888
<i>Two toothbrushes...</i>

20:34.890 --> 20:36.725
<i>one of them
could be that woman's.</i>

20:37.693 --> 20:39.659
Yeah, of course there's no way
to know for sure

20:39.661 --> 20:42.131
but, Ruthie, I found lingerie.

20:42.764 --> 20:45.699
<i>Red, lacy,
sexy, just the kind that a woman</i>

20:45.701 --> 20:47.226
<i>who makes scenes
in public would wear.</i>

20:47.228 --> 20:49.773
Yeah, okay, what does Agent
"what's-his-name" think?

20:50.639 --> 20:51.871
He doesn't think.

20:51.873 --> 20:54.241
All he does is follow the rules
and say, "no."

20:54.243 --> 20:56.242
It sounds a little crazy, Rach.

20:56.244 --> 20:58.244
I know, I know, it is crazy.

20:58.246 --> 21:01.147
And David was sometimes
a little crazy.

21:01.149 --> 21:03.283
Ruthie, I can't leave
until I find out what happened

21:03.285 --> 21:04.753
to David.

21:05.154 --> 21:08.254
All right, but, Rachel, be safe.

21:08.256 --> 21:09.625
Okay.

22:07.183 --> 22:09.619
David!

23:08.010 --> 23:08.744
- Hey.
- Ah!

23:09.745 --> 23:11.880
- Something wrong?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry...

23:12.380 --> 23:14.684
- you scared me.
- I look that bad?

23:16.284 --> 23:18.021
No, you look great.

23:19.388 --> 23:20.220
There's a place
across the street

23:20.222 --> 23:21.891
if you want to grab
dinner later.

23:24.793 --> 23:25.829
Done.

23:58.060 --> 23:59.926
Would you be offended
if I ordered a drink?

23:59.928 --> 24:01.794
No, why would that offend me?

24:01.796 --> 24:05.933
Because you're a Muslim, right?

24:05.935 --> 24:07.467
You don't know many Muslims,
do you?

24:07.469 --> 24:09.069
Please, have a drink, have two.

24:09.071 --> 24:11.073
I'd join you, but I'm
on the job.

24:11.974 --> 24:12.742
Yeah...

24:13.876 --> 24:15.979
don't want to break any
of those State Department rules.

24:18.214 --> 24:19.883
Can I take a rain check, though?

24:25.253 --> 24:27.354
You ever hear the joke
about the Jew and the Muslim...

24:27.356 --> 24:28.692
who went into a bar?

24:29.291 --> 24:30.857
No.

24:30.859 --> 24:32.826
Nor did I.
I don't think there is one.

24:32.828 --> 24:33.863
I Googled it once.

24:33.865 --> 24:36.062
I had to give a toast
at a friend's bachelor party.

24:36.064 --> 24:38.100
He's a Palestinian guy...
married a Jewish girl.

24:38.767 --> 24:40.834
- Seriously?
- Yeah, met on J-Date.

24:40.836 --> 24:41.771
How?

24:41.773 --> 24:44.106
He joined the site on a dare
and hit the J-jackpot.

24:45.474 --> 24:47.941
And what did their families
think about that?

24:47.943 --> 24:50.309
It was a pretty big deal,
as you can imagine.

24:50.311 --> 24:52.311
You know, his mom had been
badgering him for years

24:52.313 --> 24:55.549
to settle down with a good
Muslim Palestinian girl.

24:55.551 --> 24:58.184
She'd been networking all her
friends and family

24:58.186 --> 24:59.552
setting up introductions.

24:59.554 --> 25:01.187
He was always on that,
um... you know,

25:01.189 --> 25:04.491
HotMuslimLove.com.
You wouldn't know that.

25:04.493 --> 25:06.929
No, no, I didn't even know
there was one.

25:08.164 --> 25:09.396
Anyway, no chance

25:09.398 --> 25:11.898
so, in the end,
she was like okay,

25:11.900 --> 25:14.269
- as long as she's Arab Muslim.
- Mm-hmm.

25:14.936 --> 25:16.238
As long as she's Muslim.

25:16.871 --> 25:18.041
- Yeah.
- So, finally,

25:18.439 --> 25:21.110
Mazel Tov!
And yeah, he got his girl.

25:23.545 --> 25:25.814
Anyway, there she was
at the wedding and uh...

25:26.282 --> 25:27.751
now she's a grandma.

25:31.553 --> 25:32.988
I like that.

25:39.128 --> 25:40.560
<i>You sure you
don't want any dessert?</i>

25:40.562 --> 25:41.895
No, no I don't...

25:41.897 --> 25:43.463
I've got a dessert rule,
twice a week,

25:43.465 --> 25:45.033
that's it, already met it.

25:45.900 --> 25:47.033
It's only Tuesday.

25:47.035 --> 25:48.402
Now I don't have to think
about it

25:48.404 --> 25:49.906
for the rest of the week.

25:50.872 --> 25:53.176
- Is that lame?
- No, it's fine.

25:59.982 --> 26:01.317
That's a great view.

26:02.251 --> 26:03.920
- Think so?
- Yeah.

26:04.919 --> 26:07.322
- It's a beautiful city.
- It's a beautiful country.

26:10.024 --> 26:11.927
You know, you should
see it sometime.

26:13.596 --> 26:14.564
Yeah.

26:17.198 --> 26:19.835
Do you feel like breaking
the rules for once?

26:22.503 --> 26:23.907
Why don't you try me?

26:24.939 --> 26:26.575
I think that we should meet
with Du Plessis.

26:27.243 --> 26:28.508
- The guy that my...
- Aw, come on.

26:28.510 --> 26:29.479
...brother worked for...

26:29.481 --> 26:31.611
- Rachel, I know who he is, okay?
- ...the Frenchman...

26:31.613 --> 26:33.914
- So, how far is it?
- We're not going to Dubai.

26:33.916 --> 26:36.319
- Why?
- I don't have the clearance.

26:37.285 --> 26:39.855
Okay, fine,
I'll talk to your supervisor.

26:40.289 --> 26:41.925
You'll talk to my sup...

26:43.524 --> 26:45.925
I don't work
in a call center, Rachel.

26:45.927 --> 26:47.895
Just go home, okay?

26:47.897 --> 26:49.629
I'll stay here in Amman
and see what strings I can pull.

26:49.631 --> 26:51.100
It's the best I can do.

26:54.336 --> 26:58.338
Okay, fine, Agent Alshadi

26:58.340 --> 26:59.509
you do that.

27:00.376 --> 27:03.179
I'm gonna go, it's late,
I got an early flight.

27:20.995 --> 27:23.664
Remember when I said,
you can't tell by looks,

27:23.666 --> 27:25.432
with religious terrorists?

27:25.434 --> 27:28.370
This guy on the other hand,
face out of Central Casting.

27:29.370 --> 27:30.404
Who is he?

27:30.406 --> 27:34.607
Mousa Abyad, a baker
from up north near Jerash.

27:34.609 --> 27:36.676
Learned how to make bombs
off the internet.

27:36.678 --> 27:39.014
Latest intel puts him here
in Amman.

27:42.251 --> 27:44.717
Any, uh... any luck with getting
the Jordanians

27:44.719 --> 27:46.088
to release the body?

27:48.057 --> 27:49.192
Jake, that's us...

27:50.591 --> 27:52.291
we asked them not to release it.

27:52.293 --> 27:53.359
What?

27:53.361 --> 27:54.627
Plan-B.

27:54.629 --> 27:56.596
Mothers wants her here
a few more days.

27:56.598 --> 27:58.298
Why? I just spent
the evening telling...

27:58.300 --> 28:00.032
He's the only one we've
been able to ID.

28:00.034 --> 28:01.068
Now he's here.

28:01.070 --> 28:03.169
Let's see who else crawls
out of the woodwork.

28:03.171 --> 28:04.704
She doesn't know where
the scroll is.

28:04.706 --> 28:06.943
Well, the crazies
don't know that.

28:10.145 --> 28:13.049
And frankly, Jake,
neither do you.

28:14.315 --> 28:16.218
What am I supposed to say
to her, huh?

28:17.218 --> 28:19.118
Actually, Dr. Rozman,
stick around

28:19.120 --> 28:21.253
we'd like to use you as bait.

28:21.255 --> 28:22.324
Well...

28:23.492 --> 28:25.194
make it a little more charming.

28:39.440 --> 28:41.076
<i>Room 802, please.</i>

28:50.119 --> 28:53.222
<i>I'm sorry sir,
room 802 isn't answering.</i>

28:53.621 --> 28:54.990
Thanks.

29:14.709 --> 29:15.943
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

29:15.945 --> 29:19.346
<i>our flight time to Dubai will be
approximately three hours.</i>

29:19.348 --> 29:21.514
<i>Flight attendants, please
prepare for takeoff.</i>

29:21.516 --> 29:22.682
You trying to get me fired?

29:22.684 --> 29:24.253
First class to Dubai?

29:26.388 --> 29:27.788
How did you find me?

29:27.790 --> 29:29.321
I work for the US government,
remember?

29:29.323 --> 29:32.195
Yeah, the State Department,
not the CIA.

29:33.328 --> 29:36.132
- I'm not leaving this plane.
- Then neither am I.

29:36.665 --> 29:38.799
Orange juice or champagne, sir?

29:38.801 --> 29:39.832
Orange juice,

29:39.834 --> 29:42.371
- shaken, not stirred.
- Oh God.

29:42.838 --> 29:44.771
You know your rogue operation,

29:44.773 --> 29:46.440
is costing the taxpayer
a lot of money.

29:46.442 --> 29:48.407
You know that might be true,
if it wasn't for the fact

29:48.409 --> 29:50.245
that I actually paid
for my own ticket.

29:50.678 --> 29:52.080
I didn't.

29:52.814 --> 29:53.748
So what's the plan?

29:53.750 --> 29:56.148
Just knock on Du Plessis'
door and say hi?

29:56.150 --> 29:58.053
No, he's expecting me.

30:00.155 --> 30:01.290
How'd that happen?

30:02.090 --> 30:04.691
I made a phone call.
Personal touch,

30:04.693 --> 30:06.229
it goes a long way.

30:42.598 --> 30:44.563
I'm sure he will be right
down, ma'am.

30:44.565 --> 30:45.467
Thank you.

30:46.267 --> 30:48.236
Dr. Rozman, welcome.

30:51.305 --> 30:54.741
And who is your
handsome companion?

30:54.743 --> 30:56.542
Jake Alshadi,
uh, family friend.

30:56.544 --> 31:00.480
Come, Mr. Alshadi, you're
with the US State Department.

31:00.482 --> 31:03.316
You don't think I vet everyone
that comes through that door?

31:03.318 --> 31:06.185
A man in my position
has to be careful.

31:06.187 --> 31:07.319
You know what they say here?

31:07.321 --> 31:11.093
"Trust in God,
but tie up your camels."

31:13.227 --> 31:17.364
Dr. Rozman, allow me to offer
you my sincerest condolences.

31:17.366 --> 31:18.232
Thank you.

31:18.234 --> 31:22.234
Your brother was a very
engaging man.

31:22.236 --> 31:25.541
A real connoisseur
of ancient cultures.

31:26.340 --> 31:29.378
I enjoyed his company
a great deal.

31:30.946 --> 31:32.615
This way, please.

31:33.615 --> 31:34.880
How much do you know

31:34.882 --> 31:38.120
about the Dead Sea Scrolls,
Dr. Rozman?

31:38.619 --> 31:42.188
Not much, I mean I know
that they were manuscripts

31:42.190 --> 31:43.757
and they were found in caves.

31:43.759 --> 31:46.760
Why did a team
of religious scholars

31:46.762 --> 31:48.928
suppress them for 44 years?

31:48.930 --> 31:50.563
On orders from the Vatican

31:50.565 --> 31:53.135
because they deny
the virgin birth?

31:53.801 --> 31:55.234
But how could it be otherwise?

31:55.236 --> 31:57.537
Even the word, "scroll"
is misleading.

31:57.539 --> 32:01.340
Most of the Dead Sea manuscripts
are badly damaged fragments.

32:01.342 --> 32:05.678
Those scraps have been pieced
together creatively

32:05.680 --> 32:08.283
to translate into different
meanings for different people.

32:08.750 --> 32:11.952
Together they might shed light
on the inspiration

32:11.954 --> 32:15.691
for the holy books
of the world's great religions.

32:16.491 --> 32:18.424
It was your brother,
who encouraged me

32:18.426 --> 32:22.231
to play out a hunch that there
might be more to be found.

32:22.898 --> 32:25.498
After four years
of scouring caves

32:25.500 --> 32:28.367
David found a new piece,
not a fragment, mind you,

32:28.369 --> 32:30.537
a scroll, perhaps the largest
ever found.

32:30.539 --> 32:34.273
Perhaps the key
to the other texts, and then

32:34.275 --> 32:36.745
the prick stole it from me!

32:37.411 --> 32:39.011
- Mr....
- No, no, no, no.

32:39.013 --> 32:40.614
I didn't kill him.

32:40.616 --> 32:43.015
My passion for collecting
only goes so far.

32:43.017 --> 32:44.419
So, who did?

32:44.421 --> 32:47.486
I wouldn't be wasting my time
with the US State Department

32:47.488 --> 32:48.323
if I knew.

32:48.325 --> 32:50.690
Mr. Du Plessis, what was written
on the scroll?

32:50.692 --> 32:51.657
I've never seen it.

32:51.659 --> 32:53.960
Hardly fair, is it,
since I paid a fortune

32:53.962 --> 32:55.028
for its discovery.

32:55.030 --> 32:56.163
What's it worth?

32:56.165 --> 33:00.436
An intact Dead Sea Scroll?
Oh my, it's beyond price.

33:01.003 --> 33:02.471
You have heard of the...

33:03.338 --> 33:06.442
Elgin Marbles, Dr. Rozman?

33:07.009 --> 33:10.479
Well, imagine
the Du Plessis Scroll.

33:11.312 --> 33:15.283
Such a discovery can make
a man's name last forever.

33:15.716 --> 33:18.652
It would be the centerpiece
of my collection

33:18.654 --> 33:20.289
of my life's work.

33:23.792 --> 33:27.763
You see, my agenda is simple,
I want what's mine back.

33:30.898 --> 33:35.769
Dr. Rozman, I'm afraid you have
no idea how entangled you are

33:35.771 --> 33:37.505
in a very dangerous business.

33:38.506 --> 33:41.074
David and I were not the only
ones scroll hunting.

33:41.076 --> 33:43.909
Word got out of our find.

33:43.911 --> 33:47.379
Several religious groups are
interested in this manuscript.

33:47.381 --> 33:50.317
- Why?
- They think it's a prophecy,

33:50.319 --> 33:52.751
a road map till the end
of the world.

33:52.753 --> 33:55.855
To these people, God's word
and God's judgment

33:55.857 --> 33:57.523
are one in the same.

33:57.525 --> 34:00.827
There's a particular fanatical
sect calling themselves

34:00.829 --> 34:03.495
- the, "Armageddon-ites."
- Catchy.

34:03.497 --> 34:07.901
They think the scroll will
hasten their desired goal

34:07.903 --> 34:09.672
the end of days.

34:10.072 --> 34:12.005
It's a call to arms

34:12.007 --> 34:14.377
a trigger for World War III.

34:16.344 --> 34:18.344
Yeah, it sounds preposterous

34:18.346 --> 34:20.612
but everyday there are people
all over the world,

34:20.614 --> 34:25.819
killing one another for what
they believe is the word of God.

34:25.821 --> 34:28.723
David was only one victim.

34:30.092 --> 34:32.092
In Jordan, you were shown
a symbol

34:32.094 --> 34:34.563
- a road map carved into his arm.
- Yes!

34:35.029 --> 34:36.398
What does it mean?

34:36.831 --> 34:37.866
I don't know.

34:39.835 --> 34:42.469
The Jordanian authorities
won't lead you

34:42.471 --> 34:44.373
to the truth of his murder.

34:45.406 --> 34:47.775
Neither will the US government.

34:48.476 --> 34:50.513
They have a different agenda
and they're not on your side.

34:52.647 --> 34:55.715
Despite David's disappointing
actions at the end

34:55.717 --> 34:58.117
my memories of your brother
are fond.

34:58.119 --> 35:01.087
So, if I can be of any
assistance...

35:01.089 --> 35:03.491
Yes, Mr. Du Plessis, um...

35:06.728 --> 35:09.462
Can you tell me who's in this
photo with David?

35:09.464 --> 35:12.998
The man is Beltran Reyes
and she is Anya Slovin.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.701
They both work for me.

35:14.703 --> 35:15.737
Doing what?

35:16.538 --> 35:17.871
Business negotiations.

35:17.873 --> 35:20.376
Do you know if my brother
and Anya were involved?

35:22.143 --> 35:23.110
Is that important?

35:23.112 --> 35:25.445
Well, I found clothing
belonging to a woman

35:25.447 --> 35:28.014
at his hotel room and he was
seen arguing with a woman

35:28.016 --> 35:29.118
the night that he disappeared.

35:29.784 --> 35:33.422
So, um,
Anya was sleeping with David?

35:33.855 --> 35:36.859
Well,
call it a sister's intuition.

35:37.726 --> 35:41.027
Well, then you should talk
to her and to Beltran.

35:41.029 --> 35:42.364
They're both in Jordan.

35:42.797 --> 35:44.831
I'll let them know
that you're coming.

35:44.833 --> 35:46.433
Thank you.

35:46.435 --> 35:48.434
We're about to get
on the plane, coach this time.

35:48.436 --> 35:49.902
Looking out
for the American taxpayer.

35:49.904 --> 35:51.003
<i>Good work, Jake.</i>

35:51.005 --> 35:52.905
<i>She might have found
the mystery woman.</i>

35:52.907 --> 35:54.907
<i>She's been a stroke of good
luck, hasn't she?</i>

35:54.909 --> 35:56.809
She got Du Plessis' attention.

35:56.811 --> 35:57.846
Play it out with her.

35:58.480 --> 35:59.746
Well, even if that puts
her in danger?

35:59.748 --> 36:01.980
<i>We're not keeping her
against her will.</i>

36:01.982 --> 36:03.215
<i>Let's let her help us.</i>

36:03.217 --> 36:04.784
By taking advantage
of her grief.

36:04.786 --> 36:06.518
<i>Our job is to get the scroll.</i>

36:06.520 --> 36:08.188
Keep it out
of the crazies' hands.

36:08.190 --> 36:09.922
Or else what? Armageddon?

36:09.924 --> 36:11.657
<i>Do you know
what's on my desk, Jake?</i>

36:11.659 --> 36:13.992
Two suicide bombings
this morning.

36:13.994 --> 36:15.295
<i>A new ISIS kidnapping</i>

36:15.297 --> 36:18.163
<i>and a bunch of religious
lunatics looking for a scroll.</i>

36:18.165 --> 36:20.233
That's a fire we can put out.

36:20.235 --> 36:21.637
<i>Good to go.</i>

36:35.484 --> 36:38.016
<i>This is Beltran Reyes,
leave me a message.</i>

36:39.654 --> 36:42.822
<i>Hi, Beltran,
this is Rachel Rozman.</i>

36:42.824 --> 36:44.924
<i>Charles Du Plessis gave me
your number</i>

36:44.926 --> 36:47.259
<i>and I was hoping
that I could talk to you</i>

36:47.261 --> 36:48.395
<i>about my brother, David.</i>

36:48.397 --> 36:51.965
<i>Um... I'll try reaching
out to Anya Slovin.</i>

36:51.967 --> 36:53.035
<i>We'll be in touch.</i>

36:55.936 --> 36:56.839
It's that one.

36:56.841 --> 36:59.775
Yes, yes,
I'm at her apartment right now.

37:01.109 --> 37:02.578
She's right here.

37:02.978 --> 37:03.911
Hello?

37:03.913 --> 37:05.545
Yes, yes,
I saw two men leaving

37:05.547 --> 37:06.645
the building as I entered.

37:06.647 --> 37:09.818
Um, muscular build,
one of them had a hip problem.

37:12.087 --> 37:14.590
Yeah, my name? Jack Bauer.

37:16.891 --> 37:19.761
Okay, I'll give her a call.
Okay, when will you be here?

37:20.295 --> 37:21.860
Is that Anya?

37:21.862 --> 37:24.163
- Oh my God, she's dead.
- Yes, I'll be waiting for you.

37:24.165 --> 37:26.032
Apartment 601.
Bye.

37:26.034 --> 37:27.666
- Rachel Rozman?
- Yeah.

37:27.668 --> 37:29.701
I'm Beltran Reyes, your brother
was my friend.

37:29.703 --> 37:31.737
- I work for Du Plessis.
- Jake Alshadi, US State...

37:31.739 --> 37:33.172
You shouldn't have brought
her here, Agent Alshadi.

37:33.174 --> 37:34.940
- You're putting her in danger.
- Like I had a choice.

37:34.942 --> 37:36.976
We need to get you two
out of here right now.

37:36.978 --> 37:38.076
Come on, let's go.

37:38.078 --> 37:39.914
The police will take care
of this.

37:42.183 --> 37:43.882
This way.

37:43.884 --> 37:46.652
- What happened back there?
- They found her, stubborn girl.

37:46.654 --> 37:48.121
She should have just
left the country.

37:48.123 --> 37:49.288
Why would they kill her?

37:49.290 --> 37:51.626
Same reason they killed
your brother.

37:53.094 --> 37:54.726
He had noble intentions

37:54.728 --> 37:56.762
he wanted to take the scroll
to a museum in the US

37:56.764 --> 37:57.931
and keep it safely there.

37:57.933 --> 37:59.866
- Where's your car?
- We took a cab.

37:59.868 --> 38:02.705
Not a good idea, drivers talk,
they'll follow you.

38:04.672 --> 38:06.639
If we're lucky,
they don't know who you are yet.

38:06.641 --> 38:09.608
- Who?
- Could be anyone. Him or him.

38:09.610 --> 38:10.679
Paranoid much?

38:10.681 --> 38:12.844
When your enemy is invisible
it's wise to be paranoid.

38:12.846 --> 38:16.215
They know who I am, so let me
play decoy, yes?

38:16.217 --> 38:17.349
You know
the King Abdullah Mosque?

38:17.351 --> 38:18.418
- The blue top?
- Yeah.

38:18.420 --> 38:20.853
There is an old church
across the street from it.

38:20.855 --> 38:23.922
I'll meet you there with a car,
but perhaps buy something.

38:23.924 --> 38:26.928
Just in case you've
been watched. See you in a bit.

38:32.933 --> 38:34.800
Do I look like the whole
nine yards?

38:34.802 --> 38:36.672
- What?
- Ayatollah.

38:37.138 --> 38:38.204
No.

38:45.346 --> 38:47.614
- What is it?
- Jake,

38:47.616 --> 38:49.681
are those guys following us?

38:49.683 --> 38:51.052
Over my shoulder.

38:52.654 --> 38:54.387
I think I just blew 40 Dinars
on this outfit.

38:54.389 --> 38:55.758
Come on, in here.

39:15.377 --> 39:17.744
I don't get it, it should
be right around here somewhere.

39:17.746 --> 39:18.878
We... we've gone too far.

39:18.880 --> 39:21.014
I thought you knew where
we were going.

39:21.016 --> 39:22.248
- I do!
- We're lost?

39:22.250 --> 39:23.049
You hear the call to prayer?

39:23.051 --> 39:24.319
Yeah, it's coming
from over there.

39:24.321 --> 39:26.420
Actually, it's bouncing off that
wall, it's that way.

39:26.422 --> 39:27.797
What is it called again?
King Abdullah Mosque?

39:27.799 --> 39:30.223
Is that with a "u"
or with an "a"?

39:30.225 --> 39:32.858
Wait a minute, are you
GPS-ing this?

39:32.860 --> 39:33.992
Yes.

39:33.994 --> 39:34.964
This way!

39:45.773 --> 39:49.241
- I'm... I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
- Which way is the church?

39:49.243 --> 39:50.946
- This way.
- Thank you.

40:02.357 --> 40:03.726
Go, go!

40:06.728 --> 40:08.427
Hurry up, get in!

40:08.429 --> 40:10.063
- Rachel?
- Please.

40:10.065 --> 40:11.934
- Rachel?
- Please, get in!

40:12.333 --> 40:13.769
Hang on a second.

40:14.735 --> 40:16.170
Go, go, go, go.

40:23.110 --> 40:24.376
We're good.

40:24.378 --> 40:25.748
Who are you?

40:26.815 --> 40:29.952
- I'm Lisbeth.
- Hi. Where's Beltran?

40:30.851 --> 40:33.186
- Where are we going?
- Somewhere safe.

40:33.188 --> 40:35.188
Funny, I don't feel safe.
Do you feel safe?

40:35.190 --> 40:38.190
Are you aware that Jesus
was a Jew, Dr. Rozman?

40:38.192 --> 40:40.058
Oh shit, here we go.

40:40.060 --> 40:41.196
What's going on?

40:43.063 --> 40:43.864
Jake?

40:44.799 --> 40:47.166
In fact,
he's actually best understood

40:47.168 --> 40:50.802
as a first-century
Jewish apocalypticist.

40:50.804 --> 40:53.207
Oh, you won't be needing that.
Khaleel?

40:55.076 --> 40:56.045
His, too.

40:58.813 --> 41:03.116
Jesus believed the world would
come to an end in his lifetime.

41:03.118 --> 41:05.083
We never had the pleasure
of meeting you nut jobs.

41:05.085 --> 41:07.055
Now stop the car, I work
for the government.

41:07.455 --> 41:09.692
And we work for a higher power.

41:10.491 --> 41:12.293
Do you know what happened
to my brother?

41:13.927 --> 41:16.098
The devil whispered in his ear.

41:21.502 --> 41:23.369
Where'd he hide the scroll,
Rachel?

41:23.371 --> 41:24.773
Hey!

41:25.172 --> 41:25.973
Hey!

41:26.840 --> 41:28.911
She doesn't know,
now stop the car!

41:30.444 --> 41:32.013
Stop the car!

41:34.248 --> 41:37.083
No! No! Get off of him!

41:37.085 --> 41:39.054
Jake! Jake!

41:39.788 --> 41:41.154
Jake!

41:41.156 --> 41:42.157
Jake!

41:43.190 --> 41:44.489
Jake?

41:44.491 --> 41:45.827
Jake!

41:46.261 --> 41:48.326
Hey, hey, it's okay.

41:48.328 --> 41:50.228
It's okay, it's okay.

41:50.230 --> 41:52.297
- It's okay.
- Oh god.

41:52.299 --> 41:53.801
He's not your friend.

41:54.235 --> 41:55.203
He was using you.

41:56.270 --> 41:59.173
Now, we... we are on the path
of righteousness.

42:00.340 --> 42:01.777
Walk with us.

42:03.277 --> 42:04.746
What happened to my brother?

42:07.815 --> 42:10.282
He was punished,
because he was a thief.

42:10.284 --> 42:11.252
By you?

42:12.286 --> 42:13.355
We didn't kill him.

42:14.154 --> 42:15.387
It was God's will

42:15.389 --> 42:18.123
he didn't escape
the desert heat.

42:18.125 --> 42:19.293
Go to hell.

42:22.397 --> 42:24.297
No, no, no.

42:42.317 --> 42:43.851
Oh god.

42:50.190 --> 42:51.326
Hello.

42:58.465 --> 43:00.234
What the hell.

43:05.505 --> 43:06.875
Um...

43:11.279 --> 43:12.347
Jake?

43:15.250 --> 43:17.550
- Jake!
- Wha...

43:17.552 --> 43:20.152
- Whoa, no, no, no.
- You okay?

43:20.154 --> 43:21.987
- Yeah, never been better.
- Okay, good.

43:21.989 --> 43:23.556
- Get in the car, Jake.
- Oh, come on...

43:23.558 --> 43:24.657
- Way to go.
- Lisbeth?

43:24.659 --> 43:26.224
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Lisbeth!

43:26.226 --> 43:28.360
- Look at me, kid, look at me.
- Hey, shh.

43:28.362 --> 43:29.561
It's okay, it's okay.

43:29.563 --> 43:32.967
Sing to the Lord a new song.

43:33.534 --> 43:36.569
Praise his name.
Proclaim his salvation.

43:36.571 --> 43:39.605
Declare his glory among
the nations.

43:39.607 --> 43:41.273
For great is the Lord

43:41.275 --> 43:44.245
and he is to be feared
above all gods.

43:49.049 --> 43:51.150
There's still time
to save yourselves.

43:51.152 --> 43:53.552
From eternal damnation
or from your crap?

43:53.554 --> 43:55.121
Oh, Jake.

43:55.123 --> 43:57.188
You really think we're
candidates for conversion

43:57.190 --> 43:58.257
to your cause, hm?

43:58.259 --> 44:01.159
- She's Jewish, I'm Muslim.
- God loves all people!

44:01.161 --> 44:03.561
He gives every soul opportunity,

44:03.563 --> 44:06.431
even if it's only one
in a million.

44:06.433 --> 44:08.970
You are wasting your time, lady.

44:11.371 --> 44:13.241
I'm on the Lord's time.

44:16.543 --> 44:17.944
Rachel?

44:17.946 --> 44:20.415
- Yes?
- Just imagine...

44:21.549 --> 44:25.050
once the Lord has his number
of redeemed

44:25.052 --> 44:27.219
the world's gonna come
to an end.

44:27.221 --> 44:28.087
Oh.

44:28.089 --> 44:30.456
And he's gonna raise up
all his chosen

44:30.458 --> 44:32.895
in his divine rapture and we...

44:34.094 --> 44:36.295
we can eat
from the Tree of Life.

44:36.297 --> 44:37.295
I... I'd like that.

44:37.297 --> 44:38.697
- Together.
- Yes.

44:38.699 --> 44:40.902
And the scroll is the key.

44:42.369 --> 44:43.304
So,

44:44.139 --> 44:46.074
where'd your brother
hide the scroll?

44:47.507 --> 44:49.076
I don't know.

44:53.581 --> 44:56.418
Khaleel! Come here!

45:25.712 --> 45:26.811
Jake!

45:26.813 --> 45:29.484
He'll keep doing this
until your memory is jogged.

45:30.150 --> 45:31.317
You know what, that's fine.

45:31.319 --> 45:33.686
I don't even know this guy,
I met him three days ago.

45:33.688 --> 45:35.154
- What?
- I don't care about him.

45:35.156 --> 45:37.255
I don't care about him, either.

45:37.257 --> 45:38.192
See.

45:40.228 --> 45:40.893
Jake!

45:40.895 --> 45:43.628
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

45:43.630 --> 45:45.333
All the Earth.

45:46.034 --> 45:49.701
Among the nations,
the Lord reigns.

45:49.703 --> 45:51.439
Let the heavens rejoice...

45:52.139 --> 45:54.208
and the earth be glad.

45:54.708 --> 45:57.610
Let the sea roar and all
that is in it.

45:57.612 --> 46:01.049
And let the field be joyful

46:01.516 --> 46:03.516
and all that is in it.

46:03.518 --> 46:09.621
Then, all the trees of the wood
shall rejoice before the Lord.

46:09.623 --> 46:10.623
<i>For he cometh.</i>

46:10.625 --> 46:12.324
<i>Your brother
was my friend.</i>

46:12.326 --> 46:14.293
To judge earth.

46:14.295 --> 46:15.330
Jake!

46:15.730 --> 46:16.998
Jake.

46:17.431 --> 46:18.466
Oh!

46:19.266 --> 46:20.201
No.

46:23.270 --> 46:24.272
Pity.

46:28.743 --> 46:30.078
Rachel...

46:31.813 --> 46:33.581
where'd your brother
hide the scroll?

46:44.859 --> 46:46.261
I don't know.

46:55.103 --> 46:56.371
If you move,

46:56.837 --> 46:59.173
he will shoot you.

47:00.507 --> 47:01.442
Khaleel?

47:12.319 --> 47:13.287
Jake?

47:14.221 --> 47:15.424
Oh god.

47:19.192 --> 47:22.763
Hey, so, how you doing?
Um, are you afraid?

47:23.630 --> 47:27.201
Because I'm really,
really afraid right now.

47:28.569 --> 47:31.270
And, we gotta get out of here.

47:31.272 --> 47:32.206
No?

47:37.210 --> 47:39.246
You know how you said,
God loves all people?

47:40.781 --> 47:42.116
He does...

47:42.750 --> 47:44.386
he really, really does.

47:45.319 --> 47:48.489
And if you could,
would you help us?

47:49.523 --> 47:51.290
Would you just walk over
to that table

47:51.292 --> 47:55.230
and grab one of those knives
and get me out of these ropes?

47:57.431 --> 47:58.433
Yes.

48:00.567 --> 48:01.569
Please?

48:02.904 --> 48:05.304
Okay, please.

48:05.306 --> 48:06.842
- No!
- Okay, got it.

48:07.542 --> 48:10.842
Um... so then,
why don't you do it?

48:10.844 --> 48:13.679
You could just walk right over
there and cut these ropes off.

48:13.681 --> 48:14.679
It'd be so fun.

48:14.681 --> 48:15.947
- Lisbeth!
- No, no, no!

48:15.949 --> 48:17.485
- Lisbeth!
- No!

48:18.786 --> 48:19.918
Jake!

48:23.257 --> 48:25.357
- Okay, we bust out of here.
- Uh-huh.

48:25.359 --> 48:28.462
Find a crowd, marketplace,
a public square.

48:30.431 --> 48:33.635
- You got the gun?
- Jake, I don't do guns, okay?

48:34.868 --> 48:36.537
- Really?
- Okay.

48:40.273 --> 48:41.674
So, the thing to keep
in mind here,

48:41.676 --> 48:43.741
is that there are better
ways to follow God.

48:43.743 --> 48:46.480
- Rachel! Come on!
- Yeah, okay.

48:46.947 --> 48:48.315
Wait, keys.

48:58.726 --> 49:00.162
What the hell?

49:06.000 --> 49:08.302
- Jake, Escalade.
- Good idea.

49:12.572 --> 49:14.241
Wow, yes!

49:16.643 --> 49:18.279
Jake, what are you doing?

49:20.514 --> 49:21.512
Rachel!

49:21.514 --> 49:23.384
Jake! Hang on!

49:28.723 --> 49:29.721
Get down!

49:29.723 --> 49:32.626
Now get on the ground!

49:37.732 --> 49:39.333
I said on the ground!

49:49.743 --> 49:51.378
Woo! Yes!
Woo-hoo!

49:53.880 --> 49:56.815
- Next time wear a shirt.
- Get in the car!

49:56.817 --> 49:58.286
You stay down!

50:03.290 --> 50:04.857
Ready? Here we go!

50:04.859 --> 50:06.761
- Take your time.
- Woo!

50:08.362 --> 50:11.630
- Whoa!
- Khaleel! Khaleel!

50:11.632 --> 50:12.667
Come on!

50:23.377 --> 50:25.543
- I think we lost them.
- Jake!

50:25.545 --> 50:27.545
- You were amazing back there.
- Jake, listen to me.

50:27.547 --> 50:29.514
Okay, so, the reason
that I'm here

50:29.516 --> 50:32.016
is because I'm my brother's
only living relative, right?

50:32.018 --> 50:33.951
You said that was standard
operating procedure.

50:33.953 --> 50:36.387
- Right.
- So, I remembered something.

50:36.389 --> 50:38.523
My brother had a mentor
in college

50:38.525 --> 50:40.992
he was a visiting professor
from Jordan.

50:40.994 --> 50:42.061
A biblical scholar.

50:42.063 --> 50:44.499
Jake, he had
a Spanish classmate.

50:45.398 --> 50:46.998
- Beltran.
- Okay, and?

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
My brother wanted us
to find him.

50:49.002 --> 50:51.402
- Who?
- Fawaz Azzam, the professor.

50:51.404 --> 50:52.337
- That's his name?
- Yes.

50:52.339 --> 50:54.005
And this is where
it gets interesting, so,

50:54.007 --> 50:55.940
David found two kittens
at a dig once

50:55.942 --> 50:57.775
he named them after
Fawaz Azzam.

50:57.777 --> 50:59.712
But he didn't have time
to take care of them

50:59.714 --> 51:00.813
so he gave them to me.

51:00.815 --> 51:01.813
- Fawaz Azzam?
- Yeah,

51:01.815 --> 51:03.349
"Fuzzy" and "Zam" actually.

51:03.351 --> 51:04.853
Oh, no.

51:07.554 --> 51:10.556
Oh, shit, Apocalypse Annie.

51:10.558 --> 51:12.793
God is coming for you, heathens!

51:13.493 --> 51:14.795
Hang tight, here we go!

51:20.701 --> 51:22.637
Agh!

51:23.436 --> 51:24.906
- Keep your head down!
- You think?

51:29.810 --> 51:30.744
Hang on.

51:43.590 --> 51:46.728
Agh! God!
What is she, crazy?

51:47.494 --> 51:49.628
- What are you doing?
- Keep it steady.

51:49.630 --> 51:50.598
Careful!

51:54.567 --> 51:57.402
- You can't escape God's wrath!
- I can't hear you!

51:57.404 --> 51:59.573
- What are you doing!
- Shout louder!

52:01.409 --> 52:02.610
Son of a bitch!

52:04.011 --> 52:05.380
I'm out.

52:10.083 --> 52:12.386
- You got a better idea?
- Uh.

52:14.788 --> 52:16.457
Oh, Rachel, Rachel!

52:29.502 --> 52:31.638
Pull up next to them, come on!

52:32.873 --> 52:35.744
- What is she doing?
- Here she comes, here she comes!

52:36.710 --> 52:38.444
What are y'all gonna do now?

52:38.446 --> 52:40.045
- Jake?
- Watch out!

52:40.047 --> 52:41.382
- Get down!
- Whoa!

52:45.552 --> 52:46.987
Khaleel!

52:49.223 --> 52:50.855
- What?
- Really?

52:50.857 --> 52:52.824
- Oh, yes!
- Hallelujah!

52:52.826 --> 52:55.793
- Yes!
- Drive the car! Drive the car!

52:55.795 --> 52:56.797
Yes, yes.

52:57.831 --> 52:59.900
- Nice driving, kid.
- Thank you.

53:06.206 --> 53:08.206
Jake? Look at this.

53:08.208 --> 53:10.942
My brother knew that I was
gonna identify his body

53:10.944 --> 53:12.543
so he carved that into his arm.

53:12.545 --> 53:14.913
It's a message, Jake, for me.

53:14.915 --> 53:16.518
It's not a river.

53:17.817 --> 53:19.150
It's the cats.

53:19.152 --> 53:20.819
"Fuzzy" and "Zam."

53:20.821 --> 53:22.186
Cats? Really?

53:22.188 --> 53:23.822
David wanted me to find
Fawaz Azzam

53:23.824 --> 53:25.757
because he knows something
about the scroll.

53:25.759 --> 53:27.259
Beltran will know how
to find him.

53:27.261 --> 53:29.126
Rachel, that is a pretty
thin thread.

53:29.128 --> 53:30.529
Well, do you have a better idea?

53:33.067 --> 53:34.702
Oh, no.

53:39.739 --> 53:42.241
No gas, no signal and half
a bottle of water between us.

53:42.243 --> 53:43.942
Unless you want to drink
washer fluid.

53:43.944 --> 53:45.947
So, what's the plan?

53:53.253 --> 53:55.286
I guess we sit tight until
the sun drops a bit.

53:55.288 --> 53:56.991
Or someone passes by.

53:57.991 --> 54:00.494
And let's hope the crazies
don't find us.

54:01.661 --> 54:04.829
You know, the trick to this
is to conserve your energy.

54:04.831 --> 54:06.667
So, we both have to keep
our mouths shut.

54:07.268 --> 54:08.869
Easier for some
then others, right?

54:09.904 --> 54:12.837
I'm serious. And we have
to cover our mouths, too.

54:12.839 --> 54:14.639
Slows the rate of dehydration
from breathing

54:14.641 --> 54:16.275
it's a scientific fact.

54:16.277 --> 54:17.744
- Really?
- Yeah.

54:20.246 --> 54:21.882
- Wow.
- Hm.

54:30.891 --> 54:31.893
How's that?

54:33.293 --> 54:34.661
It's very chic.

54:41.868 --> 54:45.772
I spy with my little eye,
something beginning with, "s".

54:47.206 --> 54:48.576
Sand.

54:58.786 --> 55:01.656
Eyes this way.
I gotta go and pee.

55:29.016 --> 55:29.984
David?

56:10.123 --> 56:12.092
David!

56:43.156 --> 56:44.191
You okay?

56:45.159 --> 56:46.127
Yeah.

56:48.295 --> 56:50.164
Come on, change of plan.
We're walking.

56:52.398 --> 56:53.732
Where are we heading?

56:53.734 --> 56:55.737
I'm Bedouin, I can get us out.

56:56.369 --> 56:58.837
With what, your Bedouin radar?

56:58.839 --> 57:01.306
My birth name is Yakub Alshadi.

57:01.308 --> 57:02.773
My grandfather lived in a tent.

57:02.775 --> 57:04.175
It's in my blood.

57:04.177 --> 57:05.911
Jake, you were raised in Ohio.

57:05.913 --> 57:07.511
I came back in the summers.

57:07.513 --> 57:10.882
For what? For Bedouin camp?
You have a desk job.

57:10.884 --> 57:13.085
You weren't even able to get
us out of that market today

57:13.087 --> 57:14.155
without a GPS.

57:14.640 --> 57:16.660
I'm gonna get us
out of here, I promise.

57:16.662 --> 57:18.925
We'll find some Bedouins
or some camels.

57:19.826 --> 57:21.192
<i>I shouldn't have left her</i>

57:21.194 --> 57:22.427
<i>with him, they disappeared.</i>

57:22.429 --> 57:24.730
You were supposed to keep
them with you.

57:24.732 --> 57:25.931
How could you lose them?

57:25.933 --> 57:27.799
I'll find them, I promise.

57:27.801 --> 57:29.936
<i>Don't make promises
you can't keep.</i>

57:30.471 --> 57:33.971
- <i>Was Anya sleeping with David?</i>
- Seems so.

57:33.973 --> 57:35.976
<i>She was like a daughter to me.</i>

57:36.375 --> 57:38.211
That would have been
inappropriate.

57:40.114 --> 57:41.346
Beltran Reyes?

57:41.348 --> 57:43.081
Gotta go.

57:43.083 --> 57:44.218
How can I help you?

57:46.753 --> 57:48.386
I'm afraid,
I won't be much help.

57:48.388 --> 57:51.956
Anything at all that can help
us find the missing US agent.

57:51.958 --> 57:54.492
I've left messages,
several times,

57:54.494 --> 57:56.427
so naturally, I'm very worried.

57:56.429 --> 57:57.929
They went to meet you
at the apartment

57:57.931 --> 58:00.098
of the dead woman.
What happened after that?

58:00.100 --> 58:02.768
We split up, so I could
get my car.

58:02.770 --> 58:04.503
We were supposed to meet
in front of the church.

58:04.505 --> 58:05.837
Why didn't you?

58:05.839 --> 58:07.842
By the time I got there,
they were gone.

58:08.509 --> 58:11.409
And what does Mr. Du Plessis
have to say?

58:11.411 --> 58:13.715
Du Plessis has nothing to do
with this.

58:16.449 --> 58:18.719
What are you doing
in the Middle East, Beltran?

58:20.052 --> 58:23.725
Protecting my friends.
What about you?

58:27.994 --> 58:29.931
Give me a call if you
hear anything.

58:37.270 --> 58:40.005
So, we get to Beltran
to get to Fawaz Azzam.

58:40.007 --> 58:42.275
Beltran, Beltran, great.

58:43.509 --> 58:46.878
- He was David's friend.
- We don't need Beltran.

58:46.880 --> 58:49.050
Once we get a signal,
I'll make a phone call.

58:49.817 --> 58:51.284
We'll be out of here in no time.

59:22.449 --> 59:24.049
Are you okay?

59:24.051 --> 59:25.052
I'm fine.

59:32.426 --> 59:33.895
What are you doing?

59:35.395 --> 59:36.998
Channeling my inner Bedouin.

59:37.464 --> 59:39.333
My grandfather was
the camel whisperer.

59:58.284 --> 01:00:00.087
It's spectacular,
isn't it?

01:00:01.221 --> 01:00:02.190
Yeah.

01:00:03.257 --> 01:00:05.827
You can see why religions
started in the desert.

01:00:09.429 --> 01:00:11.365
Jake, do you think
we're gonna get out of here?

01:00:13.967 --> 01:00:16.237
It'll be dawn soon,
we should get some rest.

01:00:19.038 --> 01:00:21.042
- You shivering?
- Yeah.

01:00:22.509 --> 01:00:23.909
That's actually supposed
to be good.

01:00:23.911 --> 01:00:25.175
It's when you stop shivering,

01:00:25.177 --> 01:00:26.978
you have to worry
about hypothermia.

01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:28.382
Yeah? Here.

01:00:29.516 --> 01:00:30.851
Thank you.

01:00:33.552 --> 01:00:35.320
- You got it?
- Yeah.

01:00:35.322 --> 01:00:36.357
You want an arm?

01:00:36.989 --> 01:00:39.192
Yeah, sure, body warmth.

01:00:40.393 --> 01:00:43.063
It's a good survival strategy.

01:00:48.502 --> 01:00:50.701
You ever hear the joke
about the beautiful Jewish woman

01:00:50.703 --> 01:00:53.139
and the Muslim man who went
out into the desert?

01:00:56.310 --> 01:00:57.411
There isn't one.

01:00:58.444 --> 01:00:59.880
Not so sure anymore.

01:01:05.319 --> 01:01:07.018
Jake, if we don't make it
out of here,

01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:08.922
who would identify your body?

01:01:12.993 --> 01:01:14.195
I don't know.

01:01:15.261 --> 01:01:18.198
Some State Department bureaucrat
probably.

01:01:22.168 --> 01:01:24.237
Makes you feel pretty alone,
doesn't it?

01:01:26.706 --> 01:01:28.141
We're not alone.

01:02:03.342 --> 01:02:04.675
Jake?

01:02:04.677 --> 01:02:06.547
Jake?

01:02:07.313 --> 01:02:09.082
- What?
- Wake up!

01:02:23.496 --> 01:02:24.498
Really?

01:02:27.801 --> 01:02:29.400
Where do you think
the owners are?

01:02:29.402 --> 01:02:31.235
I don't know,
I don't see anyone.

01:02:31.237 --> 01:02:32.670
- Come on.
- Oh, my god.

01:02:36.543 --> 01:02:37.511
Jake!

01:02:38.478 --> 01:02:40.047
Yeah, that's right.

01:02:40.647 --> 01:02:42.380
I know.

01:02:42.382 --> 01:02:43.648
Oh my god!

01:02:43.650 --> 01:02:44.681
- Wow.
- What?

01:02:44.683 --> 01:02:46.418
I'm coming, Rachel.

01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:48.022
I gotta get my shoes.

01:02:48.822 --> 01:02:50.291
Hey, hut!

01:02:50.790 --> 01:02:52.389
Well, mine's not going anywhere.

01:02:52.391 --> 01:02:54.261
<i>Yallah, yallah!</i>

01:02:55.228 --> 01:02:56.230
Hut!

01:04:23.616 --> 01:04:25.285
Is the Wi-Fi on?

01:04:27.888 --> 01:04:31.257
Fawaz Azzam,
no got nothing.

01:04:32.424 --> 01:04:35.228
- I don't know. I think...
- Mm.

01:04:37.931 --> 01:04:40.668
- I gotta call the office.
- Wait, where are you going?

01:04:41.634 --> 01:04:43.268
Outside. Better reception.

01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:45.239
Um... stay in here,
out of the heat.

01:04:48.641 --> 01:04:50.110
Wow.

01:05:00.619 --> 01:05:01.786
Hello?

01:05:01.788 --> 01:05:04.221
Rachel, I've been worried
about you.

01:05:04.223 --> 01:05:05.355
Where are you?

01:05:05.357 --> 01:05:07.427
I... I don't know, we're in a...

01:05:08.261 --> 01:05:11.395
- village in the desert, I guess.
- In the desert?

01:05:11.397 --> 01:05:13.264
We were supposed to meet
at the church.

01:05:13.266 --> 01:05:14.666
Beltran, did my brother
ever tell you

01:05:14.668 --> 01:05:16.038
about a man named Fawaz Azzam?

01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:18.636
He was a Jordanian professor,
he taught in the US.

01:05:18.638 --> 01:05:19.770
<i>Fawaz Azzam?</i>

01:05:19.772 --> 01:05:21.708
<i>Yes, he was our professor.</i>

01:05:22.676 --> 01:05:23.710
She's right.

01:05:24.877 --> 01:05:26.476
Goddamn kitties.

01:05:26.478 --> 01:05:28.813
- <i>How's she holding up?</i>
- She's great.

01:05:28.815 --> 01:05:29.913
Why wouldn't she be?

01:05:29.915 --> 01:05:32.951
She's been lied to, interrogated
chased by lunatics.

01:05:32.953 --> 01:05:34.822
Still, at least she got
a free camel ride.

01:05:35.422 --> 01:05:37.221
<i>Listen carefully, Rachel.</i>

01:05:37.223 --> 01:05:39.224
<i>Is Agent Alshadi with you?</i>

01:05:39.226 --> 01:05:40.692
Yeah, he's on the phone.

01:05:40.694 --> 01:05:42.726
<i>What do you think
the US government</i>

01:05:42.728 --> 01:05:44.330
<i>wanted from David?</i>

01:05:48.567 --> 01:05:51.272
They're, uh, texting me
the address and phone number.

01:05:52.304 --> 01:05:54.440
You know, you might think
about switching carriers.

01:05:54.873 --> 01:05:56.709
I got great reception in here.

01:05:57.610 --> 01:05:58.842
Oh yeah, who'd you call?

01:05:58.844 --> 01:06:00.747
Beltran, he called me.

01:06:01.748 --> 01:06:02.715
What did he want?

01:06:03.583 --> 01:06:04.652
Just to make sure
we're still alive.

01:06:05.451 --> 01:06:06.918
Well, that's rich,
coming from him.

01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:07.955
What else did he say?

01:06:09.022 --> 01:06:11.759
Nothing. I told him to meet
us at Fawaz Azzam's.

01:06:15.728 --> 01:06:16.730
Nice.

01:06:19.866 --> 01:06:21.733
What do you have against
him anyway?

01:06:21.735 --> 01:06:22.903
I don't like his beard.

01:06:23.636 --> 01:06:26.570
Well, he was
my brother's friend, so,

01:06:26.572 --> 01:06:27.607
I trust him.

01:06:29.509 --> 01:06:30.808
You know,
if it wasn't for Beltran

01:06:30.810 --> 01:06:31.911
we wouldn't be here right now.

01:06:32.679 --> 01:06:35.413
Jake, if you knew your way
around Amman

01:06:35.415 --> 01:06:37.482
we wouldn't have ended up
getting in the wrong car.

01:06:37.484 --> 01:06:39.786
Wait, I only got in that car
because of you.

01:06:40.487 --> 01:06:42.753
And I was trying to save
our asses,

01:06:42.755 --> 01:06:44.621
which I swear is your job.

01:06:44.623 --> 01:06:45.426
If it wasn't for me

01:06:45.428 --> 01:06:46.801
we'd still be wandering
around the desert!

01:06:46.803 --> 01:06:49.059
And if it wasn't for me
you'd still be tied up

01:06:49.061 --> 01:06:50.610
- to a pole in the bunker!
- Yeah.

01:06:50.612 --> 01:06:52.933
Getting punched by some
guy, trying to protect you!

01:06:52.935 --> 01:06:54.898
- What about the car chase?
- What about the car chase?

01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:56.366
Fine, you know what?

01:06:56.368 --> 01:06:57.634
You don't want Beltran around.

01:06:57.636 --> 01:06:59.704
I'll go see Fawaz Azzam,
on my own.

01:06:59.706 --> 01:07:00.771
I don't need you!

01:07:00.773 --> 01:07:02.308
Welcome to Jordan.

01:07:03.342 --> 01:07:05.245
Something for your wife?

01:07:16.922 --> 01:07:18.391
There he is.

01:07:23.596 --> 01:07:25.666
Mothers thinks you might
be losing it.

01:07:26.732 --> 01:07:28.666
So he sent you to babysit?

01:07:28.668 --> 01:07:31.472
He sent me to remind you
to do your job.

01:07:33.406 --> 01:07:34.905
You're letting it get personal.

01:07:36.676 --> 01:07:38.746
You need to see
the bigger picture.

01:07:59.632 --> 01:08:00.701
Be careful.

01:08:10.110 --> 01:08:11.878
This place is like a time warp.

01:08:14.447 --> 01:08:15.715
I think it's here?

01:08:16.116 --> 01:08:18.983
- Greetings!
- Greetings.

01:08:18.984 --> 01:08:20.484
- Greetings.
- State your business.

01:08:20.486 --> 01:08:22.452
Rozman, Rachel Rozman.

01:08:22.453 --> 01:08:24.756
We're here to see Fawaz Azzam.

01:08:24.758 --> 01:08:26.460
It's you.

01:08:27.727 --> 01:08:28.729
It is!

01:08:29.662 --> 01:08:32.095
I apologize
for my grandson's behavior.

01:08:33.999 --> 01:08:35.667
Dear, Rachel.

01:08:36.602 --> 01:08:38.904
I take it since you are here
that David...

01:08:40.106 --> 01:08:44.475
- has disappeared.
- Yes. Found, but gone.

01:08:44.477 --> 01:08:46.479
My deepest sympathies.

01:08:46.979 --> 01:08:48.113
But I'm not surprised,

01:08:48.115 --> 01:08:50.884
the last time I saw him,
I was very worried about him.

01:08:52.618 --> 01:08:55.988
- Who have you brought here?
- Uh... Jake, sir, Jake Alshadi.

01:08:56.587 --> 01:08:59.756
Come, Beltran is already here.

01:08:59.758 --> 01:09:00.761
Okay.

01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:05.866
There we go.

01:09:07.499 --> 01:09:09.801
Thank you.

01:09:14.907 --> 01:09:16.977
- Hello, Rachel.
- Hey.

01:09:24.584 --> 01:09:27.688
I am very sorry to see you here,
dear Rachel.

01:09:29.654 --> 01:09:32.926
- Why?
- David asked me for a favor.

01:09:33.959 --> 01:09:35.693
If you ever come to my door,

01:09:35.694 --> 01:09:39.197
I should give you something
he left with me.

01:09:39.198 --> 01:09:40.667
The scroll?

01:09:42.768 --> 01:09:45.904
Extremely dangerous.
David knew that.

01:09:47.941 --> 01:09:49.676
Just a piece of paper.

01:09:51.611 --> 01:09:53.542
Anything can be a weapon

01:09:53.545 --> 01:09:56.913
for the right kind
of imagination.

01:09:56.915 --> 01:09:58.549
Imagination of fanatics.

01:09:58.551 --> 01:10:00.885
Well, isn't it true
that the US government

01:10:00.887 --> 01:10:03.253
has many men who believe
in the end of days?

01:10:03.255 --> 01:10:04.857
Even some of your presidents.

01:10:06.226 --> 01:10:08.125
And he wanted me to have it?

01:10:08.127 --> 01:10:12.028
Yes, you alone.

01:10:12.030 --> 01:10:13.433
It's here?

01:10:16.669 --> 01:10:17.938
It's all right.

01:10:21.708 --> 01:10:22.810
Hm.

01:10:44.163 --> 01:10:45.796
Have you opened it yet?

01:10:45.798 --> 01:10:49.867
It's too fragile.
Even to touch by hand.

01:10:49.869 --> 01:10:53.005
It should be examined
in a proper lab.

01:10:53.906 --> 01:10:56.006
We think that my brother
was killed for it,

01:10:56.008 --> 01:11:00.780
- by a religious group.
- Yes, the Armageddon-ites.

01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:05.082
The apocalypse has always
had great appeal.

01:11:05.084 --> 01:11:06.951
God created the world.

01:11:06.953 --> 01:11:11.622
Man pollutes and profanes it.
God will destroy it.

01:11:11.624 --> 01:11:14.625
That's the message
they are meant to deliver.

01:11:14.627 --> 01:11:16.193
The world as it is,

01:11:16.195 --> 01:11:18.565
and the world as it should be.

01:11:19.831 --> 01:11:22.102
But it always ends
in a massacre.

01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:25.569
Tell me, Rachel,

01:11:25.571 --> 01:11:27.641
what did David want you
to do with it?

01:11:28.173 --> 01:11:29.909
He wanted it to go to a museum.

01:11:30.944 --> 01:11:32.012
Good.

01:11:35.914 --> 01:11:39.585
You've brought snakes
to my garden, dear Rachel.

01:11:40.954 --> 01:11:41.989
Duck!

01:11:45.223 --> 01:11:48.658
- Come on, there will be others.
- Okay. Jake, he's not breathing!

01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:50.060
Rachel, Rachel, we need to move,
come on!

01:11:50.062 --> 01:11:51.328
He's not breathing!

01:11:51.330 --> 01:11:52.930
- Come on.
- No.

01:11:52.932 --> 01:11:54.568
Come on, let's go!

01:12:07.112 --> 01:12:09.081
- Come on, come on.
- Rachel, let's go.

01:12:14.353 --> 01:12:15.755
Oh, shit.

01:12:17.255 --> 01:12:19.593
- All right, my car.
- Okay.

01:12:23.896 --> 01:12:26.363
How did they know that we were
gonna be at Fawaz Azzam's?

01:12:26.365 --> 01:12:27.698
Maybe they followed Beltran.

01:12:27.700 --> 01:12:29.199
What? Are you kidding me?

01:12:29.201 --> 01:12:30.900
Maybe they followed
Agent Hanley.

01:12:30.902 --> 01:12:32.802
Why don't you cut
the crap, Jake?

01:12:32.804 --> 01:12:34.704
The US government has
an interest in the scroll

01:12:34.706 --> 01:12:35.872
which differs from
Charles Du Plessis'.

01:12:35.874 --> 01:12:37.341
Yeah, they want to destroy it.

01:12:37.343 --> 01:12:39.076
Keep it out of the hands
of the lunatics.

01:12:39.078 --> 01:12:41.581
They've been using you
to find it, Rachel.

01:12:42.382 --> 01:12:43.884
Is that true?

01:12:46.919 --> 01:12:49.252
Your brother dug up a problem
the world didn't need.

01:12:49.254 --> 01:12:50.320
We had to try and fix it.

01:12:50.322 --> 01:12:52.922
Was her brother also
a problem to fix?

01:12:52.924 --> 01:12:55.292
Come on, who has the resources,
the connections

01:12:55.294 --> 01:12:57.468
with the Jordanian police to
hide the fact they killed him?

01:12:57.470 --> 01:12:58.378
What are you implying?

01:12:58.380 --> 01:13:00.732
Well, it wouldn't be difficult
for you guys to stage

01:13:00.734 --> 01:13:03.203
that tragic death scene
in the desert, would it?

01:13:04.704 --> 01:13:06.069
If the US government went
to the trouble

01:13:06.071 --> 01:13:08.372
of killing David Rozman
and covering up his death

01:13:08.374 --> 01:13:09.873
we would have had the scroll
long ago.

01:13:09.875 --> 01:13:11.742
- So, then what happened?
- I don't know.

01:13:11.744 --> 01:13:13.377
But you don't care either,
do you?

01:13:13.379 --> 01:13:15.616
This was never about my brother.

01:13:18.718 --> 01:13:20.512
Rachel, we had to find out
what you knew.

01:13:20.514 --> 01:13:21.985
We had to find out what was
in the scroll.

01:13:21.987 --> 01:13:23.220
Stop the car, please,
Beltran, now.

01:13:23.222 --> 01:13:25.756
What are you doing? Rachel,
we have the scroll, it's over!

01:13:25.758 --> 01:13:27.694
- I can't trust you!
- You can't trust him!

01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:29.795
Give me your phone.

01:13:31.763 --> 01:13:33.100
Give her the phone.

01:13:35.168 --> 01:13:36.233
The phone!

01:13:36.235 --> 01:13:38.105
And... and... uh, your wallet!

01:13:41.307 --> 01:13:42.643
Really?

01:13:45.044 --> 01:13:46.877
Rachel, I've been trying
to protect you.

01:13:46.879 --> 01:13:48.945
Yeah, because it's your job,
right?

01:13:48.947 --> 01:13:50.049
Choose to!

01:13:51.817 --> 01:13:54.417
- Think about what you're doing.
- I told you, Jake

01:13:54.419 --> 01:13:56.757
I don't need you.
I can do this on my own.

01:14:03.995 --> 01:14:06.699
Please, Rachel,
listen to me, if I...

01:14:11.103 --> 01:14:12.172
I'm sorry.

01:14:16.275 --> 01:14:18.078
Wait, wait.

01:14:22.949 --> 01:14:24.817
Goddamn you!

01:14:49.107 --> 01:14:50.908
<i>It's gonna be okay, Rachel.</i>

01:14:50.910 --> 01:14:53.146
<i>Don't worry, it's gonna be fine.</i>

01:15:05.258 --> 01:15:07.158
How did you know about Jake?

01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:09.527
Well, Du Plessis is a very
rich man.

01:15:09.529 --> 01:15:11.164
He's got many friends.

01:15:52.271 --> 01:15:53.837
This is Jake!

01:15:53.839 --> 01:15:56.776
Yeah, I need a car
and a driver!

01:15:59.611 --> 01:16:01.144
<i>My brother died
for this scroll</i>

01:16:01.146 --> 01:16:02.579
<i>there's no way I'm giving
it to Du Plessis</i>

01:16:02.581 --> 01:16:04.180
<i>just so he can hang it
on his wall.</i>

01:16:04.182 --> 01:16:06.350
<i>David never would have
wanted that.</i>

01:16:06.352 --> 01:16:08.586
You know, Rachel,
to be honest,

01:16:08.588 --> 01:16:10.587
Du Plessis is a blind man,
and pathetic.

01:16:10.589 --> 01:16:12.857
His mistress was sleeping
with your brother.

01:16:12.859 --> 01:16:14.524
- Anya Slovin?
- Yep.

01:16:14.526 --> 01:16:16.393
She was beautiful and ambitious.

01:16:16.395 --> 01:16:17.595
What are you getting at?

01:16:17.597 --> 01:16:19.132
Isn't it obvious?

01:16:19.865 --> 01:16:21.465
The scroll is valuable.

01:16:21.467 --> 01:16:22.933
Your brother had it,
she wanted it.

01:16:22.935 --> 01:16:24.167
So, she killed my brother?

01:16:24.169 --> 01:16:27.270
Du Plessis had no idea of Anya's
betrayal until you told him.

01:16:27.272 --> 01:16:29.907
You remember, a woman
with red lingerie,

01:16:29.909 --> 01:16:32.609
who stopped your brother
from giving away the scroll?

01:16:32.611 --> 01:16:33.980
We were both quite surprised.

01:16:33.982 --> 01:16:36.380
I don't... I don't understand
what you're saying, it doesn't...

01:16:36.382 --> 01:16:38.215
Okay, okay, give me a second.

01:16:38.217 --> 01:16:40.417
We need to get out of this
country right now.

01:16:40.419 --> 01:16:43.423
We'll get you back home safely.

01:16:44.956 --> 01:16:46.860
This is the best you could do?

01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:49.393
I'll drive. We're looking
for a blue Honda Civic,

01:16:49.395 --> 01:16:50.493
give me the keys.

01:16:50.495 --> 01:16:52.431
Mm, I was told you're off
the case.

01:16:53.365 --> 01:16:54.935
Give me the damn keys, Cronin!

01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:56.969
Not gonna happen.

01:16:58.236 --> 01:16:59.338
Can I use your phone?

01:17:10.016 --> 01:17:11.180
<i>Sorry, Jake,</i>

01:17:11.182 --> 01:17:13.252
this mess is escalating
with Hanley dead.

01:17:13.686 --> 01:17:15.418
You're off the case.

01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:16.653
<i>We're putting together a team.</i>

01:17:16.655 --> 01:17:18.521
She's my responsibility.

01:17:18.523 --> 01:17:19.590
Not anymore.

01:17:19.592 --> 01:17:20.957
She might get hurt, even killed.

01:17:20.959 --> 01:17:25.095
<i>Listen Jake, a US agent
is dead, it's a CIA issue now.</i>

01:17:25.097 --> 01:17:27.665
You're not qualified to handle
this, so stay out of it.

01:17:27.667 --> 01:17:29.166
You're not gonna do anything?

01:17:29.168 --> 01:17:31.338
I got you the ride back,
take it.

01:17:38.009 --> 01:17:40.377
Listen, uh, I'm sorry.

01:17:40.379 --> 01:17:42.046
What for?

01:17:42.048 --> 01:17:43.148
This.

01:17:46.485 --> 01:17:47.487
Screw you, man!

01:17:49.487 --> 01:17:51.090
Nice shoes.

01:17:54.293 --> 01:17:56.560
- Yes?
- <i>Is the scroll okay?</i>

01:17:56.562 --> 01:17:58.394
Don't worry, it's with me.

01:17:58.396 --> 01:18:00.299
Did Du Plessis killed Anya?

01:18:01.032 --> 01:18:03.436
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- We're in Petra.

01:18:07.205 --> 01:18:08.275
You did?

01:18:13.646 --> 01:18:14.778
I know,

01:18:14.780 --> 01:18:18.284
but you know, all he had to do
was tell me what it was.

01:18:19.051 --> 01:18:22.489
You have to understand,
it was his fault, not mine.

01:18:24.589 --> 01:18:26.125
Who are you?

01:18:27.392 --> 01:18:28.962
Let's say...

01:18:30.062 --> 01:18:32.332
a simple servant of God.

01:18:34.066 --> 01:18:36.036
And you can be as well, Rachel.

01:18:40.572 --> 01:18:43.343
I'm in Petra, you have any idea
what your boy Beltran is up to?

01:18:44.442 --> 01:18:45.609
You tell me,

01:18:45.611 --> 01:18:47.347
he took my new Escalade.

01:18:48.213 --> 01:18:49.579
A gold Escalade?

01:18:49.581 --> 01:18:51.215
Beige interior.

01:18:51.217 --> 01:18:54.286
Which I just learned has been
found in the desert.

01:18:55.620 --> 01:18:57.354
<i>Agent Alshadi?</i>

01:18:57.356 --> 01:18:59.023
<i>The car we were kidnapped in.</i>

01:18:59.025 --> 01:19:00.460
<i>Beltran's an Armageddon-ite!</i>

01:19:05.463 --> 01:19:07.100
What a pretty face you have.

01:19:08.234 --> 01:19:11.137
You don't have to be frightened,
I'm not going to hurt you.

01:19:11.637 --> 01:19:13.306
I have no reason to.

01:19:24.383 --> 01:19:25.485
You should envy David.

01:19:26.486 --> 01:19:28.455
He was allowed to die
in the service of God.

01:19:29.355 --> 01:19:32.655
God has a plan for you, Rachel,
and it's beautiful.

01:19:32.657 --> 01:19:34.390
But you must understand

01:19:34.392 --> 01:19:35.884
for those who know they
are living

01:19:35.886 --> 01:19:39.762
in the last days of the world
death takes on a new meaning.

01:19:39.764 --> 01:19:41.167
You'll see.

01:19:42.301 --> 01:19:43.634
Stop the car!

01:20:12.831 --> 01:20:13.767
Please help!

01:20:14.834 --> 01:20:18.534
There's a man... that man,
he's trying to kill me!

01:20:39.424 --> 01:20:41.194
Rachel!

01:21:29.542 --> 01:21:30.543
Thank you.

01:21:59.672 --> 01:22:03.640
The day of the Lord
is upon all the nations!

01:22:03.642 --> 01:22:06.542
And it shall be as though
they have never been.

01:22:06.544 --> 01:22:08.679
You get any closer
and I swear to you

01:22:08.681 --> 01:22:10.314
I will throw this over the edge.

01:22:10.316 --> 01:22:12.385
Don't be foolish, give it to me.

01:22:13.384 --> 01:22:14.253
No.

01:22:15.286 --> 01:22:17.287
Are you willing to make
the same sacrifice

01:22:17.289 --> 01:22:18.689
as your brother, Rachel?

01:22:18.691 --> 01:22:22.295
Because I promise
I'll kill you for it.

01:22:24.262 --> 01:22:25.764
Drop the gun, Beltran!

01:22:26.764 --> 01:22:27.767
Jake?

01:22:34.539 --> 01:22:36.708
Admit it, you're happy
to see me.

01:22:37.810 --> 01:22:38.745
Yeah.

01:22:41.312 --> 01:22:42.878
I said drop the gun!

01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:44.717
You drop it, Agent Alshadi!

01:22:46.951 --> 01:22:49.789
- Shit.
- Or we'll kill you both.

01:23:01.467 --> 01:23:03.536
- You okay?
- Yeah. Good to see you.

01:23:09.741 --> 01:23:11.975
You can only shoot one of us.

01:23:11.977 --> 01:23:13.546
Come on, drop it.

01:23:23.021 --> 01:23:24.356
Kick it to me.

01:23:41.639 --> 01:23:42.642
No!

01:23:45.544 --> 01:23:47.943
Agh!

01:24:04.495 --> 01:24:05.565
Jake?

01:24:10.035 --> 01:24:12.538
- No!
- Don't move.

01:24:32.057 --> 01:24:34.460
You don't know what you've done.

01:24:34.927 --> 01:24:37.664
It's over. It's gone.

01:24:38.463 --> 01:24:41.398
That scroll was more important
than your life.

01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:45.001
It belonged to me
and you'll be judged for it.

01:25:12.998 --> 01:25:14.898
Jake?

01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:17.503
Jake? Jake?

01:25:18.102 --> 01:25:20.436
Oh, God. Jake, listen to me.

01:25:20.438 --> 01:25:21.807
You gotta talk to me,
come on, Jake.

01:25:22.473 --> 01:25:24.774
You feel that?
That is my hand.

01:25:24.776 --> 01:25:27.443
You and I are walking
out of here tonight.

01:25:27.445 --> 01:25:29.112
Jake, come on, wake up.

01:25:29.114 --> 01:25:32.485
Help! Help!

01:25:34.052 --> 01:25:35.519
Jake, I want you to talk to me.

01:25:35.521 --> 01:25:38.154
Listen to me, this is Rachel,
can you hear me?

01:25:38.156 --> 01:25:39.726
Jake, you've been hurt.

01:26:04.048 --> 01:26:05.384
Hey.

01:26:06.785 --> 01:26:07.586
Hey.

01:26:10.155 --> 01:26:12.558
Now that's a pretty good
looking poster.

01:26:13.558 --> 01:26:16.960
"The Rozman Scrolls"
has a nice ring to it.

01:26:16.962 --> 01:26:18.397
Yeah.

01:26:18.996 --> 01:26:20.600
I'm so proud of David.

01:26:21.667 --> 01:26:24.201
I think it took two Rozmans
to make that happen.

01:26:24.203 --> 01:26:25.937
So, what'd the researchers say?

01:26:26.704 --> 01:26:30.075
They said that they keep finding
new artifacts every day.

01:26:30.808 --> 01:26:32.576
They think that this might be
an entire

01:26:32.578 --> 01:26:34.711
ancient library of key texts.

01:26:34.713 --> 01:26:37.213
Wow. Here's to David's legacy.

01:26:37.215 --> 01:26:38.349
Yeah.

01:26:38.351 --> 01:26:41.685
- We should go celebrate.
- Sure, where do you want to go?

01:26:41.687 --> 01:26:42.818
There's a place near here

01:26:42.820 --> 01:26:44.623
that has the best baklava
in the city.

01:26:45.022 --> 01:26:46.122
Baklava?

01:26:46.124 --> 01:26:47.760
What about your dessert rule?

01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:49.429
What dessert rule?

01:26:49.943 --> 01:26:52.695
Didn't you say you only have
two desserts in one week?

01:26:52.697 --> 01:26:54.797
I didn't say that.
Did I say that?

01:26:54.799 --> 01:26:56.565
- Yeah.
- Must have been some other guy.

01:26:56.567 --> 01:26:57.967
The guy who took
a bullet for you

01:26:57.969 --> 01:26:59.235
doesn't have a dessert rule.

01:26:59.237 --> 01:27:01.671
Oh, okay, yes,
you're very courageous.

01:27:01.673 --> 01:27:03.206
Thanks, just doing my job

01:27:03.208 --> 01:27:04.944
saving the world
from Armageddon.

01:27:05.944 --> 01:27:06.978
You know what?

01:27:07.713 --> 01:27:09.715
If you actually think
about it...

01:27:10.281 --> 01:27:12.248
you didn't actually take
a bullet for me.

01:27:12.250 --> 01:27:14.717
I'm the one who threw the scroll
to deflect the gun

01:27:14.719 --> 01:27:18.368
so, technically, I'm the one
who saved your life.

01:27:18.370 --> 01:27:19.182
- Technically?
- Mm-hmm.

01:27:19.184 --> 01:27:20.689
I threw myself in front
of that bullet

01:27:20.691 --> 01:27:22.192
because you were backed up
against a cliff.

01:27:22.194 --> 01:27:23.862
I was busy saving your life.

01:27:25.129 --> 01:27:26.863
I have the scars to prove it.

01:27:26.865 --> 01:27:27.730
The scars?

01:27:27.732 --> 01:27:30.469
Oh no, no, that was singular.
"Scar".

01:27:30.936 --> 01:27:33.773
- Well, it's a pretty big scar.
- Uh-huh.

01:27:34.205 --> 01:27:35.641
How's it feel?

01:27:40.779 --> 01:27:41.848
It's tender.

01:27:43.848 --> 01:27:44.917
How about...

01:27:45.883 --> 01:27:46.886
now?

01:28:20.445 --> 01:28:25.445
