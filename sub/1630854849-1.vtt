Morning, Ma'am.

04:19.040 --> 04:21.079
Malcolm's in a foul mood.

04:21.080 --> 04:22.639
Oh, nothing new there, then.

04:22.640 --> 04:25.199
The victim's male,
looks to be in his 40s.

04:25.200 --> 04:26.399
A lighthouse technician.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.519
Amy Watson saw him on the boat
and called it in.

04:28.520 --> 04:30.919
I've left a message
with Missing Persons.

04:30.920 --> 04:32.359
Morning, Jac.
Morning, Ma'am.

04:32.360 --> 04:34.199
Have we got a name
for our sailor yet?

04:34.200 --> 04:35.999
No ID was found on the victim
or the boat,

04:36.000 --> 04:37.999
but there was a registration number
on its radio.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.039
I'll run it through
the UK Ship Register. Great.

04:40.040 --> 04:42.639
How about the coastguard?
Any distress signals?

04:42.640 --> 04:43.720
No, nothing.

04:52.920 --> 04:55.560
That boat could've come in
from anywhere.

04:59.320 --> 05:00.840
Right, come on.

05:02.360 --> 05:06.280
Let's check the tides,
see if we can narrow it down. Ma'am.

05:10.160 --> 05:14.479
Ah. And another police officer
tramples all over the crime scene.

05:14.480 --> 05:18.119
I'd just prefer it if people
didn't stomp all over the evidence.

05:18.120 --> 05:19.679
I'm funny like that (!)

05:19.680 --> 05:21.960
I've never known you to be funny,
Malcolm.

05:25.320 --> 05:26.879
So, what can you tell us?

05:26.880 --> 05:29.039
You know the score, DCI Stanhope.

05:29.040 --> 05:31.959
I'll know an awful lot more
once I get him back to the lab.

05:31.960 --> 05:34.079
What time of death?

05:34.080 --> 05:36.679
It doesn't look like
he died this morning.

05:36.680 --> 05:38.959
Rigor mortis is absent,
so the best I can offer you

05:38.960 --> 05:41.679
is some time
in the last two or three days.

05:41.680 --> 05:44.000
So Friday or Saturday.

05:45.520 --> 05:47.839
Any clue as to how he died?

05:47.840 --> 05:50.079
At the risk of repeating myself,
DCI Stanhope...

05:50.080 --> 05:52.200
Yeah, well, something happened here.

05:53.360 --> 05:57.119
Yes, the injury on his cheekbone was
sustained shortly before he died.

05:57.120 --> 05:58.279
There is minor swelling,

05:58.280 --> 06:00.960
but not the colour change I'd expect
from an older bruise.

06:05.920 --> 06:07.080
Move.

06:09.360 --> 06:12.600
There's a nastier head injury
back here.

06:13.600 --> 06:14.679
Assaulted?

06:14.680 --> 06:17.160
Too early to tell. He could've
injured himself on the boat.

06:18.160 --> 06:21.799
Ah, come on, Malcolm,
give us something to go on.

06:21.800 --> 06:24.199
Right, well...

06:24.200 --> 06:27.559
See this lividity pattern
on the side of his face?

06:27.560 --> 06:29.999
This tells me that he was
lying on something very specific

06:30.000 --> 06:32.039
for several hours after he died,

06:32.040 --> 06:34.479
and that pattern doesn't match
anything in the vicinity.

06:34.480 --> 06:37.079
Are you saying he's been moved?

06:37.080 --> 06:39.240
Or whatever it was
was washed overboard.

06:40.760 --> 06:42.560
Right, thanks, Malcolm.

06:43.800 --> 06:46.159
As quick as you can on this one

06:46.160 --> 06:49.079
cos if he has been dead
a couple of days,

06:49.080 --> 06:52.199
could be someone at home
needs to know about it.

06:52.200 --> 06:55.400
Don't forget to trample
on more evidence on the way out (!)

07:01.800 --> 07:04.959
Ma'am?
Oh, tell me you've got a name.

07:04.960 --> 07:07.239
Frank Channing.
Missing Persons got back to us.

07:07.240 --> 07:09.639
He lived in Tritlington.
Oh, so he's local.

07:09.640 --> 07:11.519
Yeah, I checked
the electoral register as well

07:11.520 --> 07:12.959
and got his next of kin.

07:12.960 --> 07:16.199
Great work, Jac. Now,
when you get back to the station,

07:16.200 --> 07:17.799
make a start on the timeline.

07:17.800 --> 07:19.959
I want to know
where he was last week,

07:19.960 --> 07:21.559
what he was doing, and who he met.

07:21.560 --> 07:23.159
Ma'am.

07:23.160 --> 07:24.959
So, who is the next of kin?

07:24.960 --> 07:26.800
Looks like his wife, Julia Channing.

07:28.760 --> 07:31.600
SHE EXHALES
I hate this bit.

07:33.480 --> 07:35.080
Right. Wish me luck.

07:48.800 --> 07:50.040
Dad!

07:59.240 --> 08:01.200
I'm very sorry, Mrs Channing.

08:03.320 --> 08:05.240
What am I gonna tell Lyle?

08:06.920 --> 08:08.640
Er... our, our son.

08:09.920 --> 08:11.160
Just turned 18.

08:12.320 --> 08:13.839
They were tight...

08:13.840 --> 08:17.320
More mates than father and son.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.640
Well, at least they used to be.

08:22.200 --> 08:24.600
I can tell him what's happened,
if you want.

08:25.800 --> 08:28.159
Mrs Channing,
when did you last see your husband?

08:28.160 --> 08:30.159
She's already said this
to Missing Persons.

08:30.160 --> 08:31.879
Don't you lot speak to each other?

08:31.880 --> 08:33.119
The Friday.

08:33.120 --> 08:36.759
He came back for lunch
just before one, and...

08:36.760 --> 08:38.800
and then he left
almost straightaway.

08:39.880 --> 08:41.039
Said it couldn't wait.

08:41.040 --> 08:43.000
So what was the emergency?

08:44.040 --> 08:46.279
I don't know. He, he didn't say...

08:46.280 --> 08:47.880
What was his job?

08:48.920 --> 08:52.640
Principal licensing officer,
Northumberland And City Council.

08:56.040 --> 09:00.439
Why didn't you report him missing
on Friday? Why wait until Sunday?

09:00.440 --> 09:02.959
He messaged me Friday.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.959
Said he was going sailing.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.439
He said he'd be back Sunday.

09:07.440 --> 09:11.439
Sunday. And where
would he have launched from?

09:11.440 --> 09:13.040
It varied on the tide.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.760
And then he'd just moor up
wherever the fancy took him.

09:18.120 --> 09:19.520
OK, love.

09:21.880 --> 09:26.319
Erm, now, can you let me have your
husband's car registration number?

09:26.320 --> 09:27.919
What's that got to do with anything?

09:27.920 --> 09:31.120
Well, presumably, it'll be parked
wherever he set sail, love.

09:32.160 --> 09:34.960
Oh, yes, right. Sorry.

09:36.760 --> 09:38.520
Thanks, love.

09:41.680 --> 09:45.279
Was it usual for your husband
to go sailing all weekend?

09:45.280 --> 09:49.199
Aye. Weekend, night sailing.

09:49.200 --> 09:52.720
He, he just liked the solitude
of being out on his boat.

09:54.200 --> 09:56.959
And he'd normally be back by Sunday?

09:56.960 --> 09:58.440
He'd arranged to meet Lyle.

09:59.640 --> 10:02.919
Him and Frank are doing up a...
an old boat.

10:02.920 --> 10:05.519
Working on it together
at Hauxley Sailing Club.

10:05.520 --> 10:08.359
And is that where
your husband kept his own boat?

10:08.360 --> 10:11.359
Aye. He was a member.

10:11.360 --> 10:12.919
It was practically his second home.

10:12.920 --> 10:15.359
Oh...

10:15.360 --> 10:16.960
WHISPERS: It's all right.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.679
Well, that's it for now, love.

10:20.680 --> 10:23.000
Thanks for your time, Mrs Channing.

10:23.960 --> 10:25.400
Mr Allen.

10:31.520 --> 10:35.119
If you told your missus on a Friday
you'd be back Sunday,

10:35.120 --> 10:37.639
she'd want to know chapter and verse
about what you were doing,

10:37.640 --> 10:38.919
where you were, wouldn't she?

10:38.920 --> 10:41.279
She'd be ringing you up to complain.

10:41.280 --> 10:43.719
ON PHONE:
'So, what's the next step, Ma'am?'

10:43.720 --> 10:46.159
ON PHONE:
'Now, Frank was a licensing officer,

10:46.160 --> 10:48.719
'with the
Northumberland City Council.'

10:48.720 --> 10:51.719
Some sort of emergency there
on Friday, so meet me there.

10:51.720 --> 10:53.800
ON PHONE:
'Let's see what they can tell us.'

11:10.240 --> 11:13.639
We've only just heard about Frank.
Couldn't this have waited?

11:13.640 --> 11:15.559
Er, no, pet, it can't.

11:15.560 --> 11:17.919
How long had Frank been
at the council?

11:17.920 --> 11:22.160
Since university,
but in licensing... five years?

11:23.320 --> 11:25.839
He was practically
part of the furniture.

11:25.840 --> 11:27.439
We know on Friday afternoon,

11:27.440 --> 11:29.959
he was dealing
with an urgent work matter...

11:29.960 --> 11:31.599
Oh, no, no, no. That's incorrect.

11:31.600 --> 11:35.160
Frank wasn't at work. He'd taken
the afternoon off to go sailing.

11:37.640 --> 11:39.799
Well, is it possible
he'd changed his mind

11:39.800 --> 11:41.239
and decided to work instead?

11:41.240 --> 11:45.639
Frank was dedicated to the council
and its values,

11:45.640 --> 11:48.160
but he had a good work-life balance.

11:50.400 --> 11:52.079
Where's his office?

11:52.080 --> 11:54.639
His desk is, er... It's over there.

11:54.640 --> 11:55.839
I'll check it out...

11:55.840 --> 11:58.359
Oh, no. I'd prefer it if
we went through the proper channels.

11:58.360 --> 12:01.039
I need to inform our legal
department, chief exec's office...

12:01.040 --> 12:03.639
We're not looking for state secrets,
love.

12:03.640 --> 12:06.720
We're just trying to ascertain
what sort of person Frank was.

12:15.840 --> 12:18.200
He was popular with everyone.

12:20.280 --> 12:23.959
So, no problems
with disgruntled licensees,

12:23.960 --> 12:26.199
or friction with councillors?

12:26.200 --> 12:27.840
No, nothing like that.

12:29.480 --> 12:31.439
Did he ever talk about
his home life?

12:31.440 --> 12:35.480
Frank was professional. He kept
his private life out of the office.

12:41.640 --> 12:43.679
D'you have permission to do that?

12:43.680 --> 12:47.719
Detective Sergeant Aiden Healey -
Northumberland and City Police.

12:47.720 --> 12:50.039
Oh.
Did you work with Frank?

12:50.040 --> 12:52.919
Ever since I left college.

12:52.920 --> 12:54.760
I'm Leonie. Becker.

12:57.440 --> 12:59.359
How did he die?

12:59.360 --> 13:02.079
Bosses didn't tell us much.
It's too early to say.

13:02.080 --> 13:05.079
But we believe that he may have been
handling some kind of emergency

13:05.080 --> 13:06.799
on Friday?

13:06.800 --> 13:08.960
Anything major's flagged up
on the staff intranet.

13:16.600 --> 13:18.439
It doesn't look like
anything came in.

13:18.440 --> 13:21.719
We don't have major emergencies
as such.

13:21.720 --> 13:24.439
You might get a nasty phone call
if someone's lost their licence,

13:24.440 --> 13:25.839
but that's it.

13:25.840 --> 13:27.879
HE EXHALES
OK.

13:27.880 --> 13:31.399
Day to day,
what did his job entail?

13:31.400 --> 13:33.199
The usual
management responsibilities.

13:33.200 --> 13:36.359
Staff appraisals,
inspection regimes.

13:36.360 --> 13:38.639
I can send you a copy
of his job description.

13:38.640 --> 13:40.639
That'd be helpful, thanks.

13:40.640 --> 13:43.679
Right, well, if that's everything...

13:43.680 --> 13:46.839
I'm surprised he wasn't
running his own department,

13:46.840 --> 13:49.199
having worked so many years
at the council.

13:49.200 --> 13:52.079
We both went for this job -
head of licensing.

13:52.080 --> 13:53.999
Oh, but you got it?

13:54.000 --> 13:56.239
They liked the work I'd done
in procurement.

13:56.240 --> 13:59.359
They wanted a fresh face,
fresh ideas.

13:59.360 --> 14:01.559
Being overlooked, though,

14:01.560 --> 14:04.119
that must've been a bitter pill
to swallow.

14:04.120 --> 14:07.639
Well, if it was, he never showed it.

14:07.640 --> 14:10.119
Now, I'm gonna need access
to Frank's computer

14:10.120 --> 14:12.039
and any other devices
he might've used.

14:12.040 --> 14:15.519
Well, I'll have to refer up.
We handle sensitive data here.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.159
Oh, well, while you're doing that,

14:17.160 --> 14:19.519
I'll refer up to the magistrate,
come back with a warrant.

14:19.520 --> 14:22.560
Maybe get access
to everyone's computer?

14:23.960 --> 14:25.800
I'll see what I can do.

14:34.480 --> 14:35.919
Anything useful in that diary?

14:35.920 --> 14:39.159
Cos talking to her was like wading
through red tape and treacle.

14:39.160 --> 14:41.119
Endless meetings.

14:41.120 --> 14:43.719
He had one on the Friday morning,
but nothing in the afternoon.

14:43.720 --> 14:45.799
Oh, cos he knew he'd be away.

14:45.800 --> 14:48.079
You know, maybe Frank
was seeing someone on the quiet.

14:48.080 --> 14:50.159
Aye, that's what I'm thinking.

14:50.160 --> 14:53.399
It's just that his colleague said
there was no emergency on Friday.

14:53.400 --> 14:56.000
They all seem to think
he was off on his boat.

14:57.520 --> 14:59.719
So let's get over
to that sailing club

14:59.720 --> 15:03.040
and find out if anyone saw him,
and if he was alone.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.479
Frank was one of the good ones.
The family must be in bits.

15:19.480 --> 15:21.639
Mm.
That's a bit of an understatement.

15:21.640 --> 15:24.040
Yeah.
Pulled that footage you asked for.

15:25.200 --> 15:27.759
So, he arrives at 14:40...

15:27.760 --> 15:29.400
And he left at...

15:33.080 --> 15:34.319
..16:30.

15:34.320 --> 15:37.959
So, do members need some
sort of code to access their boats?

15:37.960 --> 15:41.239
Key fob.
How much does the CCTV cover?

15:41.240 --> 15:43.079
Everything
around the main gate here.

15:43.080 --> 15:45.319
It's not bad,
considering we're a small club.

15:45.320 --> 15:48.640
Well, I'll need to see all
the footage covering the last month.

15:49.960 --> 15:52.159
Aye, no problem.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.679
Can anyone get near the boats
without a fob?

15:54.680 --> 15:57.479
Not by car,
but you could walk in, yeah.

15:57.480 --> 15:59.479
Can you show me
where Frank kept his boat?

15:59.480 --> 16:00.920
Yeah.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.560
It was just here.

16:10.800 --> 16:14.520
And you don't have a camera
covering this area? No.

16:15.520 --> 16:17.479
But sailors
are a close-knit community.

16:17.480 --> 16:20.239
They'd have gone to help Frank
if he was in trouble.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.760
Yeah, only if they could
actually see what was happening.

16:27.840 --> 16:30.759
How long does it take
to hitch a boat?

16:30.760 --> 16:35.839
Varies. Experienced sailors -
around 30 to 35 minutes.

16:35.840 --> 16:38.240
Well, Frank was here
knocking on two hours.

16:39.920 --> 16:44.360
So, he hitches his boat to his car
and drives off at 4:30.

16:45.680 --> 16:47.679
Other than Amble and Alnwick,

16:47.680 --> 16:49.759
where else
could he have set sail from?

16:49.760 --> 16:51.439
Anywhere with a proper launch ramp,

16:51.440 --> 16:53.040
or that's shallow enough
to drive in.

16:54.160 --> 16:56.999
Aye. And the tide wasn't right
to launch from here?

16:57.000 --> 16:59.519
Not on Friday, not at that time.

16:59.520 --> 17:02.679
Well, he wouldn't have sailed far.

17:02.680 --> 17:05.839
He had plans for Sunday afternoon.

17:05.840 --> 17:08.399
He was doing up an old boat here
with his son, Lyle.

17:08.400 --> 17:09.719
Mm.

17:09.720 --> 17:11.799
Is that it?
Yeah.

17:11.800 --> 17:14.120
No-one saw him coming or leaving
Friday.

17:16.160 --> 17:19.559
And is the son a regular face
down here at the club?

17:19.560 --> 17:21.200
He is...

17:22.600 --> 17:24.679
But what, love?
PHONE RINGS

17:24.680 --> 17:25.839
Nothing.

17:25.840 --> 17:27.879
No, come on.
You were gonna say something.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.799
He's a teenage lad.
Do I need to say any more?

17:29.800 --> 17:31.320
Aye, you do, pet.

17:32.520 --> 17:33.600
I dunno.

17:34.840 --> 17:36.760
He's gone into himself lately.

17:38.040 --> 17:40.559
You look at him in the wrong way,
and you'll get a mouthful.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.040
Ma'am? They've found Frank's car.

17:50.520 --> 17:53.199
We have to stop meeting like this,
DCI Stanhope.

17:53.200 --> 17:54.639
Yeah, say that again.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.880
Right, well, we found
droplets of blood in the car.

17:58.240 --> 18:00.680
Samples are on the way to the lab.
Right.

18:09.200 --> 18:13.079
Is there any evidence to suggest
he was assaulted at this site?

18:13.080 --> 18:15.199
None whatsoever.
We found no blood on the ground,

18:15.200 --> 18:17.879
and there's no trace evidence
of an assault.

18:17.880 --> 18:20.280
One more thing -
come and have a look at the boot.

18:24.640 --> 18:25.960
Recognise that?

18:28.840 --> 18:30.840
You've got to be kidding me.

18:33.160 --> 18:36.719
That's the same pattern
Frank had on the side of his face.

18:36.720 --> 18:38.000
Correct.

18:39.080 --> 18:43.960
So he was killed and then dumped
in the boot of his car.

18:45.560 --> 18:48.920
Which means
we still don't have a crime scene.

18:52.440 --> 18:55.040
And that could be anywhere.

19:01.240 --> 19:04.879
Now we've seen footage of his car,
leaving the sailing club,

19:04.880 --> 19:07.959
but we've got no idea
who's driving it.

19:07.960 --> 19:10.799
Could be Frank or his killer.

19:10.800 --> 19:13.759
Or anyone in between, come to that.

19:13.760 --> 19:16.279
Did SOCOs find anything at
the sailing club?

19:16.280 --> 19:17.999
They're going down there
this morning.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.439
They've not been yet?!
What are they waiting for?!

19:20.440 --> 19:23.439
They've got major staffing issues,
but the site's been cordoned off.

19:23.440 --> 19:25.519
Jac, where are we on the timeline?

19:25.520 --> 19:28.199
Frank might've had
an early morning inspection, Ma'am.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.599
His car pinged the ANPR,

19:29.600 --> 19:31.879
then we see him arrive
in Menton Road at 7:33AM.

19:31.880 --> 19:35.279
His boss gave us a copy
of his job description.

19:35.280 --> 19:37.199
He didn't do inspections any more,

19:37.200 --> 19:39.639
so he must've been there
for some other reason.

19:39.640 --> 19:42.079
He returns to his car at 9:15AM.

19:42.080 --> 19:44.199
Mark and I questioned shop owners,
no-one saw him.

19:44.200 --> 19:47.399
Er, yeah. We also checked out
a nearby bus station.

19:47.400 --> 19:49.999
Now footage shows someone who
could be Frank waiting for a bus.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.920
This time, wearing a cap.

19:55.160 --> 19:56.759
Yeah, that's him.

19:56.760 --> 20:00.639
But where's that bag?
Didn't find that in his car,

20:00.640 --> 20:02.559
hasn't been found anywhere else.

20:02.560 --> 20:05.239
Maybe that's what
the killer was after.

20:05.240 --> 20:07.959
Ma'am, Frank bought a laptop
a month ago.

20:07.960 --> 20:12.039
Did he? We need to find them both.

20:12.040 --> 20:13.919
But why would he be
at the bus station

20:13.920 --> 20:16.679
when he's got his own motor?
Picking somebody up?

20:16.680 --> 20:18.439
On his own when he returned
to his car.

20:18.440 --> 20:22.199
Let's get the internal CCTV
from all the buses.

20:22.200 --> 20:25.639
From say 7:30 to 9:15.

20:25.640 --> 20:27.679
That's gonna take some time
to get through.

20:27.680 --> 20:29.879
Yeah. Well, they better get started,
then!

20:29.880 --> 20:31.999
JAC: On it, Ma'am.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.159
Now, by all accounts,
Frank was a popular fella.

20:35.160 --> 20:39.119
Someone killed him,
dumped him in his boot.

20:39.120 --> 20:41.999
Let's look at Friday.
He lies to his missus about

20:42.000 --> 20:45.359
some emergency at work.
Then tells her he's gonna be off

20:45.360 --> 20:47.519
for the weekend.
Now what does that sound like?

20:47.520 --> 20:48.639
Problems at home.

20:48.640 --> 20:50.959
So let's take a look at
the Channings' marriage.

20:50.960 --> 20:55.679
And run a check on the son
and Glynn Allen, the lad's grandad.

20:55.680 --> 20:57.559
Now, Kenny, phone records?

20:57.560 --> 21:01.319
Er, well, the "urgent text" that,
er, Frank received at 13:17

21:01.320 --> 21:03.679
was from an unregistered device
in Acklington.

21:03.680 --> 21:06.239
But Frank's own phone pings off
the same tower

21:06.240 --> 21:07.999
about 20 minutes later.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.399
So looks like he's driven
straight there.

21:10.400 --> 21:13.319
And we know he's at the sailing club
by 14:40,

21:13.320 --> 21:15.959
so he dealt with that emergency
pretty quickly.

21:15.960 --> 21:19.359
Well, and at 15:15, he
calls a "Callum Terry".

21:19.360 --> 21:21.599
But the call only lasted about
20 seconds, so...

21:21.600 --> 21:23.280
could've been a butt dial.

21:24.600 --> 21:26.519
Could've been a what?
A butt dial.

21:26.520 --> 21:28.879
When you sit on your phone,
and accidentally call someone.

21:28.880 --> 21:30.239
Oh...

21:30.240 --> 21:34.159
Do that a lot, do you, Kenny,
talk out your backside?

21:34.160 --> 21:35.559
I learnt from the best, Ma'am.

21:35.560 --> 21:37.599
HE LAUGHS

21:37.600 --> 21:41.679
Well, we need to track down
this Callum Terry.

21:41.680 --> 21:45.720
Top priority, the CCTV from
the, er, bus company.

21:50.720 --> 21:52.959
So, Mr Channing suffered
a head injury.

21:52.960 --> 21:54.599
I already know that.

21:54.600 --> 21:56.999
Is it from an assault or what?
Accident?

21:57.000 --> 21:58.559
Well, it could've been either.

21:58.560 --> 22:00.719
Is that what killed him?
No, it isn't.

22:00.720 --> 22:02.679
He would've suffered
a mild concussion.

22:02.680 --> 22:05.879
Been back on his feet
within a couple of days. So, what?

22:05.880 --> 22:09.119
Er, cause of death
was blunt force trauma to the ribs.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.879
Caused by?

22:10.880 --> 22:14.079
Well, it's the kind of injury
you see a lot in car crashes,

22:14.080 --> 22:16.039
or people falling
from significant heights,

22:16.040 --> 22:17.279
out of windows, for example.

22:17.280 --> 22:19.559
Obviously we can rule
both those things out.

22:19.560 --> 22:21.879
I'm not ruling anything out.
Good for you.

22:21.880 --> 22:25.759
So you think he was hit
with something...

22:25.760 --> 22:26.959
or kicked?

22:26.960 --> 22:29.399
Well, I'd be minded to opt
for the kick,

22:29.400 --> 22:32.199
judging by the shape
of the bruising.

22:32.200 --> 22:33.679
You see here.

22:33.680 --> 22:36.599
Now, the blunt force trauma
would've caused

22:36.600 --> 22:39.199
a hemopneumothorax.
Hm?

22:39.200 --> 22:42.679
No? Oh, disappointing, DCI Stanhope.

22:42.680 --> 22:45.280
His lungs collapsed and he
would've died shortly afterwards.

22:48.080 --> 22:51.799
And those injuries to his wrists
and fingers...

22:51.800 --> 22:52.999
They're historic injuries.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.759
What, sailing-related?

22:54.760 --> 22:57.439
Er, hard to tell
without more context. Right.

22:57.440 --> 22:58.999
Thanks, Malcolm.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.840
Oh, I nearly forgot.

23:02.040 --> 23:03.080
Here you are.

23:05.240 --> 23:06.759
Animal, vegetable or mineral?

23:06.760 --> 23:08.919
It's a bacon bap. My treat.

23:08.920 --> 23:11.759
I know it's not much
of a leaving present, but...

23:11.760 --> 23:13.959
Oh, news travels fast.

23:13.960 --> 23:16.359
So when where you thinking
of telling us? Erm...

23:16.360 --> 23:18.359
Or were you just gonna disappear?

23:18.360 --> 23:21.999
No. Well, I've been invited to join
a wonderful institute in Copenhagen,

23:22.000 --> 23:25.199
who are doing the most remarkable
work in the field of paleology,

23:25.200 --> 23:28.039
which is the study of grains
and pollens in forensics...

23:28.040 --> 23:31.319
Well, I've gotta crack on, love.
You know how it is.

23:31.320 --> 23:34.719
But, Malcolm...
Yeah.

23:34.720 --> 23:36.200
Good luck, love.

23:37.800 --> 23:39.120
Well, it's been fun.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.560
Sort of.

23:48.480 --> 23:49.679
What?

23:49.680 --> 23:51.920
SOCOs have found blood
on Lyle's boat.

23:54.800 --> 23:57.240
If that is our victim's blood...

23:58.760 --> 24:01.119
..not looking good for his son,
is it?

24:01.120 --> 24:04.280
D'you want me to bring him in?
Aye.

24:08.560 --> 24:09.799
And bag this fleece up.

24:09.800 --> 24:12.319
Look, just let me past!
DS Healy.

24:12.320 --> 24:14.399
What do you mean I can't go through?
It's my boat!

24:14.400 --> 24:15.519
Look, move out the way!

24:15.520 --> 24:17.439
What are the chance of that being
Frank's son?

24:17.440 --> 24:20.119
OFFICER: Hey, calm yourself down.

24:20.120 --> 24:22.719
DCI Stanhope, I'm in charge here.

24:22.720 --> 24:24.759
I'm very sorry about your dad, love,

24:24.760 --> 24:26.759
but you DO NOT shout at my officers.

24:26.760 --> 24:29.439
I just wanna work on me boat.
Well, you can't!

24:29.440 --> 24:30.919
That's me dad's fleece.

24:30.920 --> 24:33.159
Yeah, well,
thanks for confirming that, pet.

24:33.160 --> 24:35.119
Now, I need you to go
with my officer.

24:35.120 --> 24:37.880
You think I killed my own dad?
This way, please.

24:41.240 --> 24:44.159
Now, do you want your mam
or a duty solicitor to be with you?

24:44.160 --> 24:45.319
It's your right.

24:45.320 --> 24:47.119
Ask your questions
so I can get out of 'ere.

24:47.120 --> 24:49.720
Oi, show some respect.

24:54.520 --> 24:56.959
Tell me what you can remember
about Friday.

24:56.960 --> 25:00.440
What, all day?
No, lunchtime onwards.

25:04.800 --> 25:07.399
I went to college.
Came home for lunch -

25:07.400 --> 25:10.760
didn't have money for canteen.
Did you see your dad?

25:11.800 --> 25:13.160
Aye.

25:14.960 --> 25:17.639
Did you talk to him?
Not really.

25:17.640 --> 25:19.319
Him and my mum were sitting
holding hands

25:19.320 --> 25:22.639
like they were on a date.
And why did that bother you?

25:22.640 --> 25:24.920
Well, they're a bit too old
for all that, aren't they?

25:27.440 --> 25:30.799
I hear you and your dad
weren't as close as you used to be.

25:30.800 --> 25:34.080
We had different ideas about things.
Like?

25:35.440 --> 25:38.519
He let people walk all over him.
That's not being a man.

25:38.520 --> 25:40.320
Anyone in particular?

25:42.640 --> 25:44.440
Take your pick.

25:46.200 --> 25:49.000
So where'd you go
after you had lunch at home?

25:51.400 --> 25:54.439
Answer me, love!
I went back to college.

25:54.440 --> 25:56.800
Well, that'll be easy enough
to check out, Ma'am.

26:06.840 --> 26:08.599
It's not enough he's lost his dad,

26:08.600 --> 26:10.599
now you're treating him
like a suspect.

26:10.600 --> 26:13.879
I'm sorry, love, but until
I find out who killed your husband,

26:13.880 --> 26:15.919
I'm ruling nobody out.

26:15.920 --> 26:18.959
Now then, we're working on a theory
that Frank was assaulted

26:18.960 --> 26:21.319
at the sailing club.
Lyle couldn't have done it,

26:21.320 --> 26:22.759
there or anywhere else.

26:22.760 --> 26:25.239
And the next time you want to talk
to my son,

26:25.240 --> 26:26.880
you come through me first.

26:28.480 --> 26:31.399
Ah. I need to ask you about
Frank's laptop.

26:31.400 --> 26:33.720
What laptop?
The one he bought recently.

26:36.600 --> 26:39.040
Well, if you don't know about it...

26:40.280 --> 26:43.319
..I'm afraid we're gonna have to
formally search your home.

26:43.320 --> 26:46.119
Do it now, if you want.
We've nothing to hide.

26:46.120 --> 26:47.439
Anything else?

26:47.440 --> 26:50.839
Aye, we found Frank's car
and trailer at the side

26:50.840 --> 26:54.759
of the River Kern.
Has he launched from there before?

26:54.760 --> 26:58.519
Dunno. You're the detective.

26:58.520 --> 27:01.119
Right, are we done 'ere?
I'm going round Jayden's.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.880
I'm taking you home, son.
See you later.

27:07.760 --> 27:09.999
Do you fancy a brew?

27:10.000 --> 27:11.960
BARISTA: There you go.
Thanks, love.

27:19.080 --> 27:21.560
Sorry for before.
Nah.

27:24.960 --> 27:26.440
Lyle's a good kid.

27:28.080 --> 27:32.000
It's only recently he's become...
difficult.

27:33.360 --> 27:36.199
Lyle accused his dad of being weak.

27:36.200 --> 27:38.719
Says that's why they drifted apart.

27:38.720 --> 27:41.879
Does that ring true?
Frank wasn't weak.

27:41.880 --> 27:43.760
But he was diplomatic.

27:44.760 --> 27:47.280
Lyle sees the world
in black and white.

27:50.800 --> 27:52.839
Has anything...

27:52.840 --> 27:57.159
significant happened in the family
over the past few weeks?

27:57.160 --> 27:58.719
I don't know what you mean.

27:58.720 --> 28:03.520
Are there any particular issues
at home I should know about?

28:05.400 --> 28:07.919
And I thought
you were being genuine.

28:07.920 --> 28:12.279
I was. I am, cos I want to find
your husband's killer.

28:12.280 --> 28:14.679
And that means
uncomfortable questions.

28:14.680 --> 28:17.039
We were just
a bog-standard married couple.

28:17.040 --> 28:21.519
So did your husband often spend
weekends away from the house?

28:21.520 --> 28:26.000
I've got a funeral to plan,
so you'll have to excuse me.

28:28.400 --> 28:32.479
Does the name Callum Terry
mean anything to you?

28:32.480 --> 28:34.559
Your husband called him on Friday.

28:34.560 --> 28:38.040
It's his best mate.
They talked all the time.

28:41.360 --> 28:44.000
Frank and I were married 20 years.

28:45.440 --> 28:48.279
We'd learned
to give each other space.

28:48.280 --> 28:50.959
And we trusted each other.

28:50.960 --> 28:53.480
That's what real love is.

29:24.520 --> 29:26.439
None of this feels real.

29:26.440 --> 29:28.640
We couldn't believe it
when Julia phoned. No.

29:30.360 --> 29:33.439
I believe you're both friends
of the family.

29:33.440 --> 29:36.959
Yeah.
In fact, we're Lyle's godparents.

29:36.960 --> 29:39.280
Cal and Frank were friends
all the way back from uni.

29:40.960 --> 29:45.119
Mr Terry, Frank's phone records
show us that he called you

29:45.120 --> 29:48.039
at 3:15 on Friday.
Aye.

29:48.040 --> 29:50.239
Confirming a night out.

29:50.240 --> 29:52.719
I-I was at work,
so I couldn't stay on long.

29:52.720 --> 29:55.559
Where d'you work?
In the hospital.

29:55.560 --> 29:58.839
We both do.
I'm a nurse manager, A&E.

29:58.840 --> 30:00.240
Surgeon. Orthopaedics.

30:01.800 --> 30:05.360
Friday was the last time
me and Frank spoke.

30:07.480 --> 30:10.919
And how did he seem?
Erm...

30:10.920 --> 30:14.280
same as usual.
Said he was going sailing.

30:16.080 --> 30:21.839
Over the last couple of weeks,
did he mention any problems at work

30:21.840 --> 30:23.679
or at home?

30:23.680 --> 30:26.839
Er, he-he never said anything
to me.

30:26.840 --> 30:32.080
He mainly talked about, erm...
sailing... Lyle.

30:35.120 --> 30:37.719
Lying's not gonna help anyone.

30:37.720 --> 30:39.519
We're not lying...
He'd moved out.

30:39.520 --> 30:41.439
Oonagh!
What?

30:41.440 --> 30:44.079
They're gonna find out anyway,
aren't they? And like she said,

30:44.080 --> 30:46.000
how is any of this helping Frank?

30:47.240 --> 30:49.520
It was a couple of weeks ago.
Why did he move out?

30:50.760 --> 30:52.879
Things had become stale between him
and Julia.

30:52.880 --> 30:56.199
Lyle says they were holding hands
on Friday,

30:56.200 --> 30:58.320
so maybe things were on the mend?

30:59.840 --> 31:02.200
I got the opposite impression.

31:03.320 --> 31:05.159
Where'd he go?

31:05.160 --> 31:08.239
We just assumed that he'd booked
into a hotel or a B&B.

31:08.240 --> 31:12.239
He didn't tell his best mate
where he was going?

31:12.240 --> 31:13.759
That was Frank all over.

31:13.760 --> 31:18.040
He was a great bloke, but he kept
his private life... private.

31:20.040 --> 31:22.999
Right. Come on. Where are we up to?

31:23.000 --> 31:25.319
Jason's sent through the footage
from the sailing club,

31:25.320 --> 31:26.919
but, er, some of it's missing.

31:26.920 --> 31:28.639
Missing?
Yeah, it's odd.

31:28.640 --> 31:30.559
Well, get a warrant
for the hard drive.

31:30.560 --> 31:32.999
I wanna see that footage
by the end of the day.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.319
And we need to get hold
of the deceased's medical records.

31:35.320 --> 31:39.559
Malcolm's flagged up some
unexplained historic injuries.

31:39.560 --> 31:42.919
Ma'am, Frank was renting a lock-up
for years from Brigant Security.

31:42.920 --> 31:44.879
Maybe the laptop's up there.

31:44.880 --> 31:46.200
In a lock-up?

31:47.160 --> 31:50.239
Now that's a long shot,
but check it out, Mark. Ma'am.

31:50.240 --> 31:52.719
Kenny, what've you got?
Well, over the last month,

31:52.720 --> 31:56.439
Frank talked to an "Alison Ayad"
14 times.

31:56.440 --> 31:58.399
Well, they don't sound like
butt dials.

31:58.400 --> 32:00.639
Far from it.
These are long conversations.

32:00.640 --> 32:01.879
And she's from Acklington.

32:01.880 --> 32:05.999
Not a million miles
from where he was on Friday.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.559
When I talked to
her social housing provider,

32:08.560 --> 32:12.119
they told me that she shares
the tenancy with her husband,

32:12.120 --> 32:13.439
Nitesh Ayad.

32:13.440 --> 32:17.759
He was the bus driver involved in
that crash about three years back.

32:17.760 --> 32:20.839
Care worker was killed,
had four bairns.

32:20.840 --> 32:22.079
Kylie Summerley.

32:22.080 --> 32:24.479
Well, Nitesh Ayad got six years
for it,

32:24.480 --> 32:26.559
but he was released two weeks ago
on licence.

32:26.560 --> 32:29.159
And who do you think was the witness
for the prosecution?

32:29.160 --> 32:31.119
Frank Channing?!
Yeah.

32:31.120 --> 32:35.679
So, Frank's evidence helped
put that driver in jail.

32:35.680 --> 32:38.919
Three years later,
old Franky boy's having long,

32:38.920 --> 32:41.560
cosy chats with the driver's missus.

32:43.080 --> 32:45.240
And now he's dead.

32:52.840 --> 32:56.199
Maybe Frank's the reason
she stayed put.

32:56.200 --> 32:58.079
I mean,
she must've come in for some stick

32:58.080 --> 33:00.319
after her husband was banged up.

33:00.320 --> 33:02.480
She probably
didn't want to uproot the kids.

33:12.640 --> 33:15.199
DCI Stanhope, DS Healey.

33:15.200 --> 33:16.639
Tesh! It's the police!

33:16.640 --> 33:18.280
Thank you so much for coming.

33:24.160 --> 33:27.679
D'you wanna take my statement here,
or down at the station?

33:27.680 --> 33:30.799
We're here about Frank Channing.
We know.

33:30.800 --> 33:33.639
I was beginning to think
he was all mouth...

33:33.640 --> 33:34.760
but he's come good.

33:36.600 --> 33:38.880
I think we're at crossed purposes,
love.

33:40.120 --> 33:42.240
We're investigating
Mr Channing's death.

33:46.000 --> 33:49.600
That's it. It's over!

33:53.120 --> 33:54.759
He's dead.

33:54.760 --> 33:57.400
I'm sorry,
why did you think we were here?

33:58.400 --> 34:00.680
It doesn't matter now.
Well, let me decide that.

34:02.920 --> 34:07.919
Last few years can't have been easy
for you, love. After the crash...

34:07.920 --> 34:09.439
That wasn't my fault...

34:09.440 --> 34:11.479
You fell asleep at the wheel,
Mr Ayad.

34:11.480 --> 34:13.799
So would anyone,
if they'd been working my hours!

34:13.800 --> 34:16.479
I just wanted to be vindicated.

34:16.480 --> 34:19.839
That's why Mr Channing
was helping us.

34:19.840 --> 34:23.519
To prove that Through-Bus are still
putting people's lives at risk.

34:23.520 --> 34:25.359
They're totally bent.
In what way?

34:25.360 --> 34:27.439
Making drivers work illegal hours.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.799
They covered it up then,
they're covering it up now.

34:29.800 --> 34:32.160
Have you got proof of that?
No.

34:33.760 --> 34:38.479
Because after the crash
they stopped. Went by the book.

34:38.480 --> 34:40.519
But now they've started up again.

34:40.520 --> 34:42.720
How d'you know that?

34:44.880 --> 34:47.039
"Carmen".

34:47.040 --> 34:50.359
Another driver
that used to work with Tesh.

34:50.360 --> 34:52.279
She came to see me,

34:52.280 --> 34:54.679
she was upset
because she'd had a near miss.

34:54.680 --> 34:57.999
So what made you reach out to Frank,
of all people?

34:58.000 --> 34:59.879
I felt he should help
put things right.

34:59.880 --> 35:02.879
He was at the trial,
standing up for the council.

35:02.880 --> 35:06.320
Saying they didn't put a foot wrong
and it was all Tesh's fault.

35:07.360 --> 35:08.759
It wasn't true.

35:08.760 --> 35:10.600
D'you have this Carmen's details?

35:11.880 --> 35:14.479
She'd been working with Frank,
gathering evidence.

35:14.480 --> 35:16.959
She's got cold feet now, but...

35:16.960 --> 35:19.399
PAPER RIPS
..you never know...

35:19.400 --> 35:21.600
she might still help.
Thanks, love.

35:23.080 --> 35:27.160
Now, did either of you see Frank
on Friday? Maybe in the afternoon?

35:28.320 --> 35:32.239
No, we were...
doing a weekly shop in Morpeth.

35:32.240 --> 35:35.040
In Morpeth?
They won't serve us round here.

35:42.960 --> 35:46.919
VERA: Do we believe that?
Frank was turning whistleblower?

35:46.920 --> 35:48.959
What would be in it for him?

35:48.960 --> 35:50.799
Clear his conscience?

35:50.800 --> 35:53.319
Cos if it turns out
Through-Bus is dodgy,

35:53.320 --> 35:55.920
it was Frank
who let 'em slip through the net.

35:56.960 --> 35:59.039
Now, at the time of the fatal crash,

35:59.040 --> 36:02.679
Frank's job included
overseeing inspections,

36:02.680 --> 36:05.599
which means he must've signed off
on all the ones

36:05.600 --> 36:07.039
relating to Through-Bus.

36:07.040 --> 36:10.399
Jac, dig out the transcripts
and witness statements

36:10.400 --> 36:12.439
from that public inquiry.

36:12.440 --> 36:14.799
And let's take a look
at Frank's inspection reports.

36:14.800 --> 36:17.879
Cos if he was following up
on what this fella says,

36:17.880 --> 36:19.359
maybe that's where he started.

36:19.360 --> 36:21.399
Tech didn't find anything
about Through-Bus

36:21.400 --> 36:22.839
on Frank's work computer.

36:22.840 --> 36:27.199
Well, maybe he was looking at them,
off the books.

36:27.200 --> 36:29.839
HEALEY: Without running it past
his boss first? Mmm.

36:29.840 --> 36:32.079
He might have had a good reason,
Ma'am.

36:32.080 --> 36:34.559
JAC SIGHS
What am I looking at?

36:34.560 --> 36:36.639
These initials, "SR".

36:36.640 --> 36:38.479
Frank met up with his union rep,
Sue Ronsel,

36:38.480 --> 36:41.359
several times in the past few weeks.
Did he?

36:41.360 --> 36:43.279
PHONE RINGS
HEALEY: 'Hello, CID.'

36:43.280 --> 36:46.439
So, was his work life difficult?

36:46.440 --> 36:49.999
Well, that's a different story
to the one given us by his boss.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.919
The rep's based over in Blyth.

36:51.920 --> 36:53.999
Take a run over there, Jac,
have a chat.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.719
See what she can tell us.
Ma'am.

36:55.720 --> 36:57.839
MOBILE RINGS,
BEEPS

36:57.840 --> 37:00.279
Yeah. I'm on me way.

37:00.280 --> 37:02.000
Julia's at the mortuary.

37:03.080 --> 37:06.680
Ma'am, you need to take
a look at this. What?

37:10.440 --> 37:11.480
SHE CLICKS TONGUE

37:35.800 --> 37:37.200
It never gets any easier.

37:39.800 --> 37:41.479
My mam died when I was ten.

37:41.480 --> 37:43.719
That's tough going.

37:43.720 --> 37:46.120
Aye. But I had my dad.

37:47.320 --> 37:51.399
Before you go, could you just
clear something up for me, pet?

37:51.400 --> 37:54.839
You see, you didn't mention
that your husband

37:54.840 --> 37:57.719
had moved out of the marital home.

37:57.720 --> 37:58.760
Who told you that?

38:00.680 --> 38:03.479
Oh, don't tell me, Oonagh.

38:03.480 --> 38:06.199
Look, I just need to know
where he was living, pet.

38:06.200 --> 38:07.680
Why would he tell me?

38:09.240 --> 38:12.079
The grieving widow
knew nothing about her husband.

38:12.080 --> 38:13.799
Her marriage
was going down the toilet.

38:13.800 --> 38:15.639
All right, love...
It's the truth, Dad.

38:15.640 --> 38:16.760
It's embarrassing!

38:18.040 --> 38:20.719
Frank was the only man
I ever wanted to be with.

38:20.720 --> 38:23.680
Now give her a moment.
I need a word anyway.

38:24.920 --> 38:26.919
As part of our investigation,

38:26.920 --> 38:29.239
we've been looking
into your background.

38:29.240 --> 38:32.519
Oh. So you'll know,
I used to be a naughty boy...

38:32.520 --> 38:35.999
If that's what you call ABH
and fleecing your customers.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.079
I've been straight
since Lyle was born.

38:38.080 --> 38:39.879
I'd never do anything
that'd hurt him.

38:39.880 --> 38:40.920
Is that right?

38:41.960 --> 38:44.599
Look, I wasn't the best dad.

38:44.600 --> 38:46.399
And when Lyle came along,

38:46.400 --> 38:48.159
I wanted to do right by him
and my daughter.

38:48.160 --> 38:50.519
Ah, commendable. So,
you wouldn't've been best pleased

38:50.520 --> 38:52.719
when you found out Frank
was leaving your daughter.

38:52.720 --> 38:55.479
He did right by her in the end.
He was coming back to her.

38:55.480 --> 38:59.039
That's all that matters.
He loved her and he loved his son.

38:59.040 --> 39:01.199
Now, hang on, hang on.

39:01.200 --> 39:04.719
So, did the pair of them still work
on the lad's boat together,

39:04.720 --> 39:06.879
even though Frank
was living elsewhere?

39:06.880 --> 39:08.359
As far as I know.

39:08.360 --> 39:11.879
D'you think Lyle knew
where his dad was living?

39:11.880 --> 39:13.999
No-one knows
what the lad's thinking these days.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.520
You'll have to ask him yourself.

39:32.320 --> 39:35.240
You weren't at the morgue
with your mam and grandad.

39:36.400 --> 39:38.600
Yeah, well, it's not exactly
a nice day out, is it?

39:40.520 --> 39:43.399
And you didn't go back to college
on Friday afternoon,

39:43.400 --> 39:44.440
like you told us.

39:47.160 --> 39:49.800
Look, lying's not gonna do anyone
any good is it, love?

39:52.080 --> 39:55.440
I came down here on Friday
afternoon. I couldn't face college.

39:57.080 --> 39:59.720
What, after seeing your mam and dad
together again?

40:00.920 --> 40:01.960
Just to sit.

40:05.080 --> 40:06.440
Did you see your dad here?

40:08.640 --> 40:09.680
Yeah, and he saw me.

40:12.120 --> 40:14.679
It was about... half two.
He waved at me from the boat.

40:14.680 --> 40:16.400
I just pretended he wasn't there.

40:17.600 --> 40:20.839
Then I went to the Black Horse,
in town. Had a couple of jars.

40:20.840 --> 40:22.960
Ah, well,
my officers will check that.

40:24.800 --> 40:27.799
Here, d'you know when I'm gonna get
my dad's fleece jacket back?

40:27.800 --> 40:29.600
Aye, when forensics have finished
with it.

40:36.160 --> 40:39.719
You know, Lyle, you and your dad,

40:39.720 --> 40:41.959
I think
you'd have worked things out.

40:41.960 --> 40:43.359
You know what I thought of him.

40:43.360 --> 40:45.799
Aye, but you still turned up here,
on Sunday, didn't you,

40:45.800 --> 40:47.040
to work on the boat?

40:48.160 --> 40:49.960
Expecting your dad to turn up.

40:52.600 --> 40:57.280
And I reckon he would've, love,
if he'd been able.

41:03.240 --> 41:06.160
Er... The fleece...

41:08.000 --> 41:10.160
..he was wearing it
last time he worked on the boat.

41:16.520 --> 41:18.240
You never said
why were you looking for me.

41:19.960 --> 41:23.159
Ah, well, I was hoping you could
tell me where your dad was staying

41:23.160 --> 41:24.359
when he left home.

41:24.360 --> 41:25.559
Cal and Oonagh's.

41:25.560 --> 41:28.359
Ah, no. They said they didn't know.

41:28.360 --> 41:31.680
Course they did.
He was at their flat. In Bedlington.

41:33.480 --> 41:34.600
Thanks, love.

PHONE RINGS
Aiden...

41:48.680 --> 41:51.199
While we're doing our best
to find your friend's killer,

41:51.200 --> 41:53.959
all you're doing
is withholding vital information.

41:53.960 --> 41:56.439
Well, what difference does it make,
whether he was here or...

41:56.440 --> 41:59.439
or in a hotel?
Cos this is a murder inquiry.

41:59.440 --> 42:02.999
I've a good mind to arrest you and
your missus for wasting police time!

42:03.000 --> 42:05.440
No. Oonagh doesn't know he was here.
Oh?

42:06.600 --> 42:08.840
I thought Frank
was her friend as well.

42:10.240 --> 42:12.719
This flat is supposed to be
a holiday let. And?

42:12.720 --> 42:14.919
I didn't tell her
Frank was staying here.

42:14.920 --> 42:16.480
It was... It was only temporary.

42:23.360 --> 42:25.919
Ah, well, it's a nice view...

42:25.920 --> 42:28.879
so two weeks here, what's that,
a grand?

42:28.880 --> 42:30.319
Something like that...

42:30.320 --> 42:32.560
Aye, I can see
that'd put a hole in your pocket.

42:34.280 --> 42:35.799
But why keep it from her?

42:35.800 --> 42:40.399
I mean, don't suppose you'd get
many bookings this time of the year.

42:40.400 --> 42:43.839
We agreed we'd never let it out
for free to friends or family.

42:43.840 --> 42:45.759
But Frank would've done the same
for me.

42:45.760 --> 42:47.919
You won't tell Oonagh about this,
will you?

42:47.920 --> 42:50.880
You're in no position
to be making deals, pet.

42:55.320 --> 43:00.639
I'm gonna ask you something again,
and I want the truth.

43:00.640 --> 43:03.840
Did Frank mention
any problems at work? Yes or no?

43:05.160 --> 43:06.199
Aye.

43:06.200 --> 43:09.919
He said his boss wanted him gone.
But he wouldn't say why.

43:09.920 --> 43:12.159
There's no laptop.
I told you that.

43:12.160 --> 43:15.400
Well, you're hardly a reliable
witness, are you, love?

43:16.640 --> 43:19.039
And next time you lie to me,

43:19.040 --> 43:22.120
you're gonna be getting a taste
of my hospitality.

43:24.840 --> 43:27.480
VERA:
So, Frank's boss wanted him gone.

43:29.080 --> 43:32.719
It looks like all roads lead back
to the council and that bus company.

43:32.720 --> 43:35.919
HEALEY: What I don't get is
if Frank starts poking around,

43:35.920 --> 43:38.999
discovers something dodgy
about the bus company,

43:39.000 --> 43:40.919
why would Belinda be bothered?

43:40.920 --> 43:42.559
I mean, does it make her look bad?

43:42.560 --> 43:45.559
Oh... Ooh, it's a possibility.
MOBILE RINGS

43:45.560 --> 43:50.359
Or maybe there's another connection
between her and Through-Bus.

43:50.360 --> 43:51.519
Jac...

43:51.520 --> 43:53.999
Ma'am, I've spoken to Sue Ronsel,
Frank's union rep.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.759
She says Leonie Becker filed
a formal complaint against Frank,

43:56.760 --> 43:59.239
accused him of
"unfair treatment in the workplace".

43:59.240 --> 44:00.519
Apparently he singled her out,

44:00.520 --> 44:02.679
and when she challenged him,
he blew up in the office.

44:02.680 --> 44:04.599
And what was the outcome?

44:04.600 --> 44:07.039
Frank was about to get sacked.

44:07.040 --> 44:09.720
BEEP
We're onto something.

44:18.080 --> 44:20.800
INDISTINCT CHATTER

44:30.600 --> 44:34.599
You failed to mention
Frank was being forced out.

44:34.600 --> 44:37.959
He was dead - why sully his name?

44:37.960 --> 44:41.279
It could've been relevant
to our investigation!

44:41.280 --> 44:43.559
"Popular with everyone",
you told us.

44:43.560 --> 44:45.759
So, why was he being chucked out,
after one row?

44:45.760 --> 44:49.399
He was undermining junior staff.
In what way?

44:49.400 --> 44:52.119
I can't divulge
confidential information.

44:52.120 --> 44:56.159
But I can tell you,
that Leonie was... affected.

44:56.160 --> 44:58.720
Well, I need to hear that from her.

45:00.440 --> 45:01.999
Where is she?

45:02.000 --> 45:05.239
Court. For a licensing case.

45:05.240 --> 45:08.439
And another thing,
did you know Frank was looking into

45:08.440 --> 45:11.439
that Through-Bus crash
from three years back?

45:11.440 --> 45:13.759
No. Why?

45:13.760 --> 45:15.399
He believed he'd found evidence

45:15.400 --> 45:18.479
that that crash wasn't entirely
the driver's fault.

45:18.480 --> 45:20.719
Well...

45:20.720 --> 45:22.080
why didn't he tell me?

45:23.080 --> 45:24.400
Why indeed?

45:25.480 --> 45:30.079
His silence could've cost lives.
Passengers, drivers...

45:30.080 --> 45:32.319
Well, I'll have to advise
the Chief Exec,

45:32.320 --> 45:34.799
institute an emergency inspection.

45:34.800 --> 45:37.319
Inform the
Health and Safety Commission.

45:37.320 --> 45:39.400
Have you got access
to this information?

45:40.560 --> 45:44.079
Well, we're still dotting the i's,
as it were.

45:44.080 --> 45:46.200
Well, as soon as you know anything,
you let me know.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.080
I'll do everything I can to help.

45:55.920 --> 45:57.159
Aiden?
'Ma'am.'

45:57.160 --> 46:00.519
Get over to the court
and find Leonie Becker.

46:00.520 --> 46:04.319
I want chapter and verse
on that row she had with Frank.

46:04.320 --> 46:05.919
If she put in a complaint,

46:05.920 --> 46:09.039
it must've been one helluva row.
'OK.'

46:09.040 --> 46:13.840
And chase up the inspection reports
for Through-Bus.

46:15.120 --> 46:17.439
There's something's not right here.

46:17.440 --> 46:19.800
MAN: It's all detailed
in the report.

46:21.200 --> 46:23.679
You made a complaint against Frank.

46:23.680 --> 46:26.599
That's right. And he deserved it.

46:26.600 --> 46:30.839
Cos he was nitpicking my work.
Micro-managing me.

46:30.840 --> 46:34.799
We used to get on really well.
And then things suddenly changed.

46:34.800 --> 46:36.239
I challenged Frank about it,

46:36.240 --> 46:39.919
and he blew up at me
in front of the whole office.

46:39.920 --> 46:42.959
I was getting upset.
And my boyfriend got worked up...

46:42.960 --> 46:44.039
How worked up?

46:44.040 --> 46:46.840
Not enough to harm Frank,
if that's what you're thinking.

46:48.320 --> 46:50.999
Jason said I should make
a formal complaint,

46:51.000 --> 46:53.279
and I thought, he's right.
Jason...?

46:53.280 --> 46:58.280
Hewley. Works at the sailing club.
Thank you.

47:09.200 --> 47:12.400
D'you recognise this, Jason?
It's from a couple of weeks ago.

47:13.840 --> 47:16.959
See, there's Frank arriving
and now he's leaving.

47:16.960 --> 47:19.599
That's peculiar,
isn't it, DS Healey?

47:19.600 --> 47:22.639
There's some footage missing
from the CCTV.

47:22.640 --> 47:24.159
How d'you explain that?

47:24.160 --> 47:28.119
Happens sometimes,
the system cuts out, reboots itself.

47:28.120 --> 47:31.519
Oh, I see.
Erm, but luckily for us...

47:31.520 --> 47:34.319
We got access
to the sailing club's hard drive.

47:34.320 --> 47:37.679
They're like elephants -
they never forget.

47:37.680 --> 47:40.480
See, here's the missing footage.

47:44.240 --> 47:45.799
VERA: Oof!

47:45.800 --> 47:47.519
I just wanted him to back off
with Leonie.

47:47.520 --> 47:50.119
And you let your fists
do the talking.

47:50.120 --> 47:52.159
Dress rehearsal for Friday,
was it...

47:52.160 --> 47:53.639
I never saw Frank on Friday,
I swear!

47:53.640 --> 47:55.799
..when you kicked
seven bells out of the fella?

47:55.800 --> 48:01.279
No! Now, on Friday,
Frank turned up at 14:40.

48:01.280 --> 48:03.039
And you disappeared.

48:03.040 --> 48:05.559
You were missing
for nearly two hours.

48:05.560 --> 48:07.439
Means, motive, opportunity...

48:07.440 --> 48:09.600
I wasn't there. I was...

48:11.360 --> 48:14.640
..in a meeting.
OK.

48:15.680 --> 48:17.160
So, where was the meeting?

48:19.720 --> 48:21.800
That's a simple enough question,
love.

48:24.040 --> 48:27.079
Client's property.
Well, that narrows it down!

48:27.080 --> 48:28.560
Business premises?

48:29.640 --> 48:32.080
Not exactly.
Their house?

48:34.520 --> 48:38.079
I've had enough of this,
take him back to the cell.

48:38.080 --> 48:39.120
Their car!

48:41.480 --> 48:44.600
What were you doing having a meeting
with a client, in their car?

48:46.520 --> 48:48.000
Name and address of this client.

48:52.600 --> 48:53.760
She's married.

48:57.080 --> 48:58.719
Oh, now we get it.

48:58.720 --> 49:01.719
I'll lose everything. My job.
Leonie.

49:01.720 --> 49:05.720
You're gonna have to tell us, love.
Or risk facing a murder charge.

49:09.080 --> 49:10.840
Leonie's boss.

49:14.680 --> 49:16.280
Belinda Rayford?

49:20.840 --> 49:22.720
You were seeing Belinda Rayford?

49:25.160 --> 49:26.400
Since when?

49:27.760 --> 49:28.880
Christmas.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.279
Last Friday,
we met outside the club,

49:33.280 --> 49:34.720
drove to a lay-by.

49:36.520 --> 49:40.319
Leonie's complaint to HR
about Frank,

49:40.320 --> 49:42.199
she told my officer here,

49:42.200 --> 49:44.639
that is was you who egged her on
to make that complaint.

49:44.640 --> 49:46.679
Aye. She wanted to let it go,

49:46.680 --> 49:49.319
but what about all the other women
he might do it to?

49:49.320 --> 49:51.639
Yeah, well, that's a fine sentiment,
love.

49:51.640 --> 49:55.599
Now, during this meeting
in the back of Belinda's car,

49:55.600 --> 49:58.679
did she happen to suggest
that the likes of Frank Channing

49:58.680 --> 50:00.360
shouldn't be working at the council?

50:03.400 --> 50:07.039
Did she?
Answer the question.

50:07.040 --> 50:10.359
No.
Are you sure?

50:10.360 --> 50:12.159
Yeah, but the way she said it,

50:12.160 --> 50:14.199
his behaviour
was affecting other people...

50:14.200 --> 50:17.719
Jason, love. She played you.
You're wrong. She cares about me

50:17.720 --> 50:21.079
and she wants to do right by Leonie.
She was stoking the fire.

50:21.080 --> 50:22.719
Nothing to do with Leonie.

50:22.720 --> 50:27.119
Belinda had her own reasons
to get rid of Frank Channing.

50:27.120 --> 50:28.919
And you helped her!

50:28.920 --> 50:30.879
We're checking Belinda's alibi.

50:30.880 --> 50:32.599
Her and Jason, though...

50:32.600 --> 50:34.399
Nah, well, takes all sorts.

50:34.400 --> 50:36.479
Her office said that
she's at a welcome brunch

50:36.480 --> 50:39.999
for European dignitaries,
some kind of twinning event.

50:40.000 --> 50:43.559
Well, let's gatecrash the party.

50:43.560 --> 50:45.360
INDECIPHERABLE CHATTER

50:47.360 --> 50:49.119
Can I get a quick photo?

50:49.120 --> 50:51.440
Oh, yes.
Lovely, thank you.

50:56.840 --> 50:58.800
CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS

51:05.680 --> 51:10.439
Well, I've just had a long chat
with Jason Hewley.

51:10.440 --> 51:12.759
Hmm.

51:12.760 --> 51:14.839
Bit close to home, isn't it?

51:14.840 --> 51:16.560
We're two consenting adults.

51:17.560 --> 51:19.759
Now I'm single, I'm just having fun.

51:19.760 --> 51:21.879
Well, he thinks you're married.

51:21.880 --> 51:24.079
Well, we all need a get-out clause,
don't we?

51:24.080 --> 51:25.839
No-one's getting hurt.

51:25.840 --> 51:27.839
Does that include Leonie?

51:27.840 --> 51:32.039
The way I see it, Frank's snooping
around into the bus company,

51:32.040 --> 51:35.160
and for some reason,
you want him gone.

51:36.720 --> 51:39.199
You're way off base, Inspector.
Am I?

51:39.200 --> 51:41.599
Yes. His behaviour
fell below the standards

51:41.600 --> 51:45.279
we expect in this organisation.
Leonie's no pushover.

51:45.280 --> 51:47.439
I reckon she was handling the row
just fine.

51:47.440 --> 51:50.079
Hmm, so you wind Jason up,

51:50.080 --> 51:52.719
send him off to find Frank
to wallop him,

51:52.720 --> 51:55.879
now, he's a big lad,
doesn't know his own strength,

51:55.880 --> 51:58.839
and, oops, he's killed him.

51:58.840 --> 52:00.159
Ridiculous.

52:00.160 --> 52:02.639
Now, you weren't to blame
for those inspections,

52:02.640 --> 52:05.279
they come under Frank's remit.
You told me that yourself.

52:05.280 --> 52:08.639
So, what did Frank have on you?

52:08.640 --> 52:10.519
Hmm?

52:10.520 --> 52:12.840
Was he blackmailing you
about something?

52:16.360 --> 52:19.199
I've answered your questions,
Inspector,

52:19.200 --> 52:24.680
so, if there's nothing else,
I have guests to attend to.

52:32.720 --> 52:38.199
There's a connection between
Belinda Rayford and Through-Bus.

52:38.200 --> 52:40.639
Are we any closer to finding it?
Nothing so far, Ma'am.

52:40.640 --> 52:43.399
We've been going through footage
from the bus station and the buses.

52:43.400 --> 52:45.639
Yeah, well, keep looking,
all of you!

52:45.640 --> 52:49.479
Because this woman is in it,
up to her neck!

52:49.480 --> 52:51.759
MOBILE RINGS

52:51.760 --> 52:54.039
Mark! Where are you?

52:54.040 --> 52:56.559
Er, Frank's storage unit.
The place is a right mess.

52:56.560 --> 52:59.039
He's still got his parents'
old furniture here.

52:59.040 --> 53:00.839
I'm not after a three-piece suite,
love.

53:00.840 --> 53:02.799
VERA: 'Did you find that bag?'

53:02.800 --> 53:05.199
Ah, yes, Ma'am. It was on a desk.
'And?'

53:05.200 --> 53:06.919
Er, well, his laptop was inside.

53:06.920 --> 53:08.719
Good work, Mark.

53:08.720 --> 53:11.199
I've had a quick look,
but he's got everything encrypted.

53:11.200 --> 53:12.719
I'm gonna get it send over to Tech.

53:12.720 --> 53:15.479
Yeah, well, keep me informed.
BEEP

53:15.480 --> 53:16.719
Mark's found the laptop.

53:16.720 --> 53:17.959
Now, as soon as we get it,

53:17.960 --> 53:20.760
I want everyone
going through those files.

53:21.920 --> 53:23.839
Ma'am, Frank did get a bus!

53:23.840 --> 53:26.920
He boarded the L80 to Alnwick
on Friday.

53:28.440 --> 53:32.239
All right, that's him.
Being thrown off.

53:32.240 --> 53:34.199
What's that driver's name?
Carmen Harris.

53:34.200 --> 53:35.399
Carmen...

53:35.400 --> 53:37.720
She was the one helping Nitesh.

53:43.160 --> 53:45.240
WOMAN: See you, Carmen.
Bye.

53:47.360 --> 53:49.479
HEALEY: There's an investigation
going on.

53:49.480 --> 53:51.880
INDECIPHERABLE CHATTER

53:54.400 --> 53:57.320
TOOLS CLATTER

53:59.200 --> 54:00.920
FAINT DRILLING

54:02.360 --> 54:04.440
Fancy a cuppa?
Oh!

54:07.280 --> 54:09.400
VERA: I know this is hard for yer...
Do you?

54:10.920 --> 54:13.439
From where I'm sitting,
I'm the only one who loses my job.

54:13.440 --> 54:17.079
Not you or Nitesh.
Well, Frank lost his life, pet.

54:17.080 --> 54:19.120
Principles
don't put food on the table.

54:21.240 --> 54:23.479
What were you and Frank
arguing about on Friday?

54:23.480 --> 54:25.719
You kicked him off your bus.
He was filming me.

54:25.720 --> 54:29.040
But wasn't that part of his
investigation into Through-Bus?

54:32.280 --> 54:36.599
A few weeks back,
I nodded off behind the wheel.

54:36.600 --> 54:38.079
It's happened to other drivers.

54:38.080 --> 54:40.040
It's only luck
there's not been another crash.

54:42.280 --> 54:45.760
So, you went to see Nitesh's missus?
Aye.

54:47.200 --> 54:48.839
Then Frank got in touch.

54:48.840 --> 54:50.999
I did everything I could
to help him.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.240
In what way?

54:58.800 --> 55:00.680
These are my tachographs.
Tachographs?

55:02.800 --> 55:05.239
They record driver information.

55:05.240 --> 55:08.479
How long we've been driving,
speed, distance.

55:08.480 --> 55:09.880
Why've you got two?

55:13.160 --> 55:17.319
So we can work illegal hours,
double shifts.

55:17.320 --> 55:18.359
We get paid,

55:18.360 --> 55:21.959
but once you've done it,
they've got yer.

55:21.960 --> 55:24.560
So you gave those to Frank?
Yeah.

55:25.680 --> 55:27.919
He downloaded all the original data.

55:27.920 --> 55:29.719
When he checked it
against the time sheets

55:29.720 --> 55:31.119
given by the bus company...

55:31.120 --> 55:34.079
They'd altered the hours?
It was a whitewash.

55:34.080 --> 55:35.720
And Frank were gonna expose them.

55:37.320 --> 55:39.879
Why did you back out
of the investigation?

55:39.880 --> 55:41.719
Cos...

55:41.720 --> 55:46.519
Frank wanted time to persuade
other drivers to join us.

55:46.520 --> 55:48.199
He was on a mission.

55:48.200 --> 55:49.559
They wanted none of it

55:49.560 --> 55:51.480
and started making
life difficult for me.

55:52.600 --> 55:54.839
Told Frank I were backing out.

55:54.840 --> 55:58.600
Tesh was angry with me and Frank.

55:59.720 --> 56:02.959
He's been getting it in the neck
from his neighbours.

56:02.960 --> 56:04.879
CARMEN: They were upset
that he was released

56:04.880 --> 56:07.079
after only serving only
half his sentence.

56:07.080 --> 56:10.759
GLASS SHATTERS,
SCREAMS

56:10.760 --> 56:12.199
Are you all right?

56:12.200 --> 56:15.919
CARMEN: That sort of personal stuff
didn't seem to register with Frank.

56:15.920 --> 56:18.679
He had tunnel vision
about the investigation.

56:18.680 --> 56:20.959
Said he was gonna
"present his findings",

56:20.960 --> 56:23.599
to Health and Safety.
At the council?

56:23.600 --> 56:25.039
No, he were going to the top -

56:25.040 --> 56:27.079
straight to the
Health and Safety Commission.

56:27.080 --> 56:29.400
Which would take time, and...

56:30.400 --> 56:32.120
..Tesh wasn't happy.

56:36.280 --> 56:37.639
VERA: Just for the record,

56:37.640 --> 56:41.679
where were you, between the hours
of four and 6pm on Friday?

56:41.680 --> 56:44.759
L114 to Bamburgh Castle.
Feel free to check.

56:44.760 --> 56:46.079
Yeah, I will, love.

56:46.080 --> 56:48.079
Someone bricked the Ayads' house.
Anyone hurt?

56:48.080 --> 56:50.999
Alison's in a state,
and Nitesh has gone after Belinda.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.679
BANGS BRICK DOWN
You're a killer!

56:53.680 --> 56:56.959
Hey!
GRUNTING

56:56.960 --> 56:59.640
THUD, GROANS

57:10.320 --> 57:12.399
What did you think
you were going to achieve,

57:12.400 --> 57:14.519
threatening Belinda Rayford?
Justice.

57:14.520 --> 57:17.119
Why target her?
She's in charge.

57:17.120 --> 57:18.399
She's always in the papers,

57:18.400 --> 57:20.639
shaking hands with VIPs,
living it up.

57:20.640 --> 57:23.599
Yeah, and you end up almost
lamping a security guard?

57:23.600 --> 57:26.359
It's not looking good for you,
Nitesh.

57:26.360 --> 57:27.879
You can't pin Frank's death on me.

57:27.880 --> 57:31.399
Your alibi doesn't check out.
Only Alison went shopping.

57:31.400 --> 57:35.119
Look, I get it. You thought Frank
was dragging his heels...

57:35.120 --> 57:38.319
D'you blame me? My girls are crying
themselves to sleep every night,

57:38.320 --> 57:40.599
and he's talking about "due process"

57:40.600 --> 57:43.639
and that we need more drivers
to come forward?

57:43.640 --> 57:47.479
So, did you try to persuade Frank
to speed up his investigation?

57:47.480 --> 57:49.679
Nah. I decided to do things my way.

57:49.680 --> 57:51.319
And what did that involve?

57:51.320 --> 57:53.279
Tracking him down
at the sailing club?

57:53.280 --> 57:55.279
He was alive when he left mine!

57:55.280 --> 57:59.240
So, you did meet Frank on Friday.
What?

58:01.600 --> 58:04.239
Yeah... I messaged him.

58:04.240 --> 58:05.800
The mystery text.

58:06.920 --> 58:08.400
Why'd you message him?

58:09.480 --> 58:12.919
Cos I was at her place, Kylie's.

58:12.920 --> 58:14.319
The woman I killed.

58:14.320 --> 58:17.599
Her family
were harassing my daughters.

58:17.600 --> 58:19.039
I wanted them to stop!

58:19.040 --> 58:21.439
And how were you gonna get 'em
to do that?

58:21.440 --> 58:23.360
Don't know. Start by asking them.

58:24.560 --> 58:27.799
Frank texted back.
Told me to hang fire,

58:27.800 --> 58:28.840
that he'd come over.

58:30.240 --> 58:32.080
But I was already at Kylie's house.

58:33.920 --> 58:36.359
I walked up the path,
ready to have it out and...

58:36.360 --> 58:37.919
And what?

58:37.920 --> 58:39.280
And I thought, "What's the point?

58:40.600 --> 58:44.079
"Nobody bloody listens."
VERA TUTS

58:44.080 --> 58:48.479
Frank arrived. We sat in his car,
he calmed me down,

58:48.480 --> 58:51.040
and he made sure I got home OK.

58:52.240 --> 58:55.000
He said the next couple of weeks
were gonna be a rollercoaster.

58:58.480 --> 58:59.640
And now he's dead.

59:01.560 --> 59:03.880
How am I gonna protect my daughters?

59:10.640 --> 59:12.520
What is it we're missing?

59:14.520 --> 59:16.920
Frank was a by-the-book kinda fella.

59:18.800 --> 59:21.799
I reckon he'd have told Belinda
what he was doing.

59:21.800 --> 59:24.199
Cos back then,
he had no reason to not trust her.

59:24.200 --> 59:26.119
But why was she so worried?

59:26.120 --> 59:30.399
Like she said, inspections came
under Frank's remit.

59:30.400 --> 59:31.720
Well, she'd end up looking bad.

59:33.360 --> 59:36.360
Or it was something else
he discovered.

59:37.680 --> 59:40.159
Mark, did Tech come back
with anything we can use

59:40.160 --> 59:43.039
from Frank's laptop?
Emails and such.

59:43.040 --> 59:44.599
Aye, but they're pretty generic.

59:44.600 --> 59:47.679
Stuff like,
"The issue we discussed today".

59:47.680 --> 59:50.320
Ah, see, she's not daft, that one.

59:51.560 --> 59:54.839
How long have Through-Bus
had the council contract?

59:54.840 --> 59:57.279
Er, by the looks of it, four years.

59:57.280 --> 1:00:00.479
And she's been head of licensing
for three.

1:00:00.480 --> 1:00:04.639
Well, she boasted about having
a senior position in procurement,

1:00:04.640 --> 1:00:06.559
before she was promoted
to licensing.

1:00:06.560 --> 1:00:09.599
Which means she'd have seen
all the bits that came in

1:00:09.600 --> 1:00:14.759
and would've had a hand in awarding
that contract to Through-Bus!

1:00:14.760 --> 1:00:16.359
What do we know about them?

1:00:16.360 --> 1:00:18.759
Major shareholders, directors?

1:00:18.760 --> 1:00:21.079
Er, Tabuk Holdings owns a 52% stake,

1:00:21.080 --> 1:00:23.679
and Strieber Finance, a 40% holding.

1:00:23.680 --> 1:00:26.599
Right, well let's start with
the first one - Tabuk Holdings.

1:00:26.600 --> 1:00:27.639
Who's the top dog there?

1:00:27.640 --> 1:00:30.359
A William Patrick Sandown.
Managing director.

1:00:30.360 --> 1:00:33.359
Strieber Finance is a Wilbur Morgan.

1:00:33.360 --> 1:00:35.439
Right, now,
we need to find a connection

1:00:35.440 --> 1:00:39.319
between Belinda Rayford
and either of those companies.

1:00:39.320 --> 1:00:41.519
And check the society pages.
What?

1:00:41.520 --> 1:00:44.519
Well, why not?
She likes hobnobbing with VIPs.

1:00:44.520 --> 1:00:49.519
I bet she's got a shedload
of ballgowns. Now, come on!

1:00:49.520 --> 1:00:53.319
Ma'am. There's no connection
between Belinda Rayford

1:00:53.320 --> 1:00:54.760
or any of the companies mentioned.

1:00:57.960 --> 1:00:59.000
SHE EXHALES DEEPLY

1:01:01.520 --> 1:01:04.119
Try Belinda Morgan.
HEALEY: What?

1:01:04.120 --> 1:01:05.839
Or Belinda Sandown.

1:01:05.840 --> 1:01:09.439
D'you remember when we confronted
her about carrying on with Jason?

1:01:09.440 --> 1:01:12.759
Said she was single.
No, she said she was single "now".

1:01:12.760 --> 1:01:15.039
There's still nothing listed
with Companies House.

1:01:15.040 --> 1:01:16.679
Oh, there's got to be something.

1:01:16.680 --> 1:01:20.159
Er, Ma'am! The electoral register
from four years ago,

1:01:20.160 --> 1:01:22.919
shows William Patrick Sandown
living with his wife,

1:01:22.920 --> 1:01:25.880
Belinda Evelyn Sandown,
in Newcastle.

1:01:27.560 --> 1:01:30.639
We need to find out
which contracts she approved,

1:01:30.640 --> 1:01:32.239
and how many of those were given

1:01:32.240 --> 1:01:35.319
to companies owned
by William Patrick Sandown.

1:01:35.320 --> 1:01:37.519
He got a sneak preview
of his competitors' bids,

1:01:37.520 --> 1:01:40.199
undercuts them, and then
splits the cash with his missus.

1:01:40.200 --> 1:01:42.439
Unmitigated fraud.

1:01:42.440 --> 1:01:45.759
And I think
that's what Frank uncovered.

1:01:45.760 --> 1:01:48.679
Nitesh Ayad
will be going back to prison.

1:01:48.680 --> 1:01:50.960
He's breached the terms
of his probation.

1:01:52.160 --> 1:01:54.559
There are no winners
in a situation like this.

1:01:54.560 --> 1:01:57.600
Are you including yourself in that?
He's the victim here.

1:02:00.200 --> 1:02:02.519
Now, we've read Frank's report.

1:02:02.520 --> 1:02:07.759
It seems, that Through-Bus
were ordering the tachographs.

1:02:07.760 --> 1:02:10.439
Slashing wages, piling on the hours.

1:02:10.440 --> 1:02:14.839
Drivers were sleeping at the depot,
taking speed to stay awake.

1:02:14.840 --> 1:02:19.279
I mean, how did you feel when he
presented you with this evidence?

1:02:19.280 --> 1:02:21.279
He never showed me
any evidence of wrongdoing.

1:02:21.280 --> 1:02:22.760
No?

1:02:24.120 --> 1:02:26.279
Well, how about
when he found out

1:02:26.280 --> 1:02:29.799
you used to be married
to William Patrick Sandown,

1:02:29.800 --> 1:02:32.719
Managing Director of Tabuk Holdings,

1:02:32.720 --> 1:02:36.360
who have lucrative shares
in Through-Bus?

1:02:41.320 --> 1:02:44.520
You brought me in here
to discuss Frank Channing's death...

1:02:46.320 --> 1:02:48.119
..not my marriage status.
Hmm.

1:02:48.120 --> 1:02:50.639
But you were a senior officer
in the department

1:02:50.640 --> 1:02:52.879
who awarded those contracts.

1:02:52.880 --> 1:02:55.359
Did you declare
a conflict of interest?

1:02:55.360 --> 1:02:56.600
You can't ask me about this.

1:02:57.640 --> 1:03:01.200
I didn't kill Frank.
Check my alibi.

1:03:03.200 --> 1:03:04.360
I was with Jason.

1:03:05.400 --> 1:03:07.999
You've got nothing on me.
Ah, but you had motive, love!

1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:13.039
Frank was about to blow up your cosy
arrangement with your ex... Cosy?

1:03:13.040 --> 1:03:15.799
While you were swanning around
in your designer heels,

1:03:15.800 --> 1:03:17.359
families were grieving.

1:03:17.360 --> 1:03:19.199
I got nothing out of this!
Pull the other one.

1:03:19.200 --> 1:03:20.320
He left me!

1:03:21.320 --> 1:03:24.200
It's Will and his new family
that are living the high life.

1:03:25.680 --> 1:03:27.039
He left me with nothing!

1:03:27.040 --> 1:03:29.719
Oh, well, I'll shed no tears
for you, pet.

1:03:29.720 --> 1:03:34.600
Did you pass on details
of rival tenders to your husband?

1:03:38.560 --> 1:03:41.080
It's a simple yes or no, pet.

1:03:46.880 --> 1:03:48.320
Yes, I did.

1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:53.040
Then the bastard left me.

1:03:55.040 --> 1:03:56.080
And that was it.

1:03:57.800 --> 1:03:59.159
I wanted nothing to do with it.

1:03:59.160 --> 1:04:01.719
Ah, well, it's a bit late for that,
Frank was already on to you.

1:04:01.720 --> 1:04:03.839
He wouldn't give me time
to fix things.

1:04:03.840 --> 1:04:05.159
What, get rid of him, d'you mean?

1:04:05.160 --> 1:04:07.799
And when your ploy
to give him the sack didn't work,

1:04:07.800 --> 1:04:10.639
you roped in The Hulk
to put the frighteners on him.

1:04:10.640 --> 1:04:12.559
Jealous, are you?
Come on, love.

1:04:12.560 --> 1:04:15.079
You can sneer all you like
about Jason.

1:04:15.080 --> 1:04:17.760
But at least I've got a man
who'll do anything for me...

1:04:20.040 --> 1:04:21.400
..makes me feel attractive.

1:04:23.960 --> 1:04:27.800
But then, you wouldn't know
anything about that, would you?

1:04:36.400 --> 1:04:40.519
If you hadn't helped your husband
win that contract,

1:04:40.520 --> 1:04:43.600
maybe Kylie Summerley
would still be alive.

1:04:45.040 --> 1:04:47.999
And maybe her daughters
would still have a mam.

1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:49.599
But they don't,

1:04:49.600 --> 1:04:54.119
because people like you care
more about holidays and fast cars

1:04:54.120 --> 1:04:55.920
than they do about anything else.

1:04:57.440 --> 1:04:58.679
Now, just for the record,

1:04:58.680 --> 1:05:01.959
we will be passing Frank's files
on to Health and Safety,

1:05:01.960 --> 1:05:06.120
the council... and the CPS.

1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:10.560
Interview terminated.
BEEP

1:05:14.400 --> 1:05:18.439
Kenny. Have we checked
Belinda Rayford's alibi?

1:05:18.440 --> 1:05:20.879
Er, yeah,
but you're not gonna like it.

1:05:20.880 --> 1:05:23.839
ANPR got a hit on a vehicle
registered in her name,

1:05:23.840 --> 1:05:26.759
on the way to Alnwick
at 13:00 hours.

1:05:26.760 --> 1:05:27.959
VERA SIGHS

1:05:27.960 --> 1:05:31.119
Well, if she's not our killer,
where does that leave us?

1:05:31.120 --> 1:05:33.799
What about the Channings' alibis,
have they all been verified?

1:05:33.800 --> 1:05:36.400
I'm-I'm still going through it all,
Ma'am.

1:05:37.920 --> 1:05:39.679
We're getting nowhere fast here,
Kenny.

1:05:39.680 --> 1:05:42.319
Ma'am. I've got a detailed report
on Frank's work computer.

1:05:42.320 --> 1:05:45.879
Now, apparently he'd copied
a few files off the system,

1:05:45.880 --> 1:05:48.119
and deleted a few.
Well, first thing in the morning,

1:05:48.120 --> 1:05:50.199
get over to Leonie Becker.

1:05:50.200 --> 1:05:53.000
See if she can shed some light.
Ma'am.

1:06:09.800 --> 1:06:13.840
Leonie? How you doing?
Great.

1:06:15.040 --> 1:06:17.600
Apart from finding out my boyfriend
was sleeping with my boss.

1:06:18.920 --> 1:06:20.520
I've pulled the files you wanted.

1:06:22.720 --> 1:06:25.319
Most of these are records
of standard licence applications.

1:06:25.320 --> 1:06:27.239
We keep those for a couple of years.

1:06:27.240 --> 1:06:30.679
So, what happens now?
Who's taking over?

1:06:30.680 --> 1:06:33.239
They've asked me to step up -
temporarily.

1:06:33.240 --> 1:06:34.319
Is that good news?

1:06:34.320 --> 1:06:36.320
I mean, I couldn't do a worse job,
could I?

1:06:37.400 --> 1:06:38.560
Well, good luck.

1:06:40.280 --> 1:06:42.520
I don't know
if it's worth me mentioning...

1:06:44.360 --> 1:06:46.159
These came in
at around about the time

1:06:46.160 --> 1:06:48.559
Frank started acting weird.
Did they?

1:06:48.560 --> 1:06:51.200
He told me not to worry about them,
and that he'd deal with it.

1:07:06.160 --> 1:07:07.959
KEYPAD BEEPS,
MOBILE RINGS

1:07:07.960 --> 1:07:10.879
BEEP
Aiden.

1:07:10.880 --> 1:07:14.039
I've got the printout
of all the files that Frank deleted.

1:07:14.040 --> 1:07:15.760
You'll never guess
who's on one of them...

1:07:17.880 --> 1:07:19.999
Who?

1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:22.280
INDECIPHERABLE CHATTER

1:07:36.360 --> 1:07:40.199
Look, I had nothing to do
with whatever Frank was up to.

1:07:40.200 --> 1:07:42.519
The council issued you
with a closure order,

1:07:42.520 --> 1:07:44.839
on the tenth of last month,

1:07:44.840 --> 1:07:47.719
and soon after that
it conveniently disappeared.

1:07:47.720 --> 1:07:50.719
So, did you threaten Frank?
Tell him to make it go away?

1:07:50.720 --> 1:07:52.839
It's all right, mate,
this is nothing.

1:07:52.840 --> 1:07:54.079
I've got a living to make.

1:07:54.080 --> 1:07:55.919
Yeah, and I've gotta find
Frank's killer.

1:07:55.920 --> 1:07:57.960
Well, you're looking
in the wrong place.

1:07:59.680 --> 1:08:01.959
I might've asked him for a favour.

1:08:01.960 --> 1:08:03.879
A favour,
well, it's a big bloody favour.

1:08:03.880 --> 1:08:07.959
I never threatened him.
I find that hard to believe.

1:08:07.960 --> 1:08:11.319
Cos he'd have taken some persuading.
Frank made the right choice.

1:08:11.320 --> 1:08:15.079
To do right by his family.
I didn't force him.

1:08:15.080 --> 1:08:19.119
You told my officers you were
in Hexham on Friday afternoon.

1:08:19.120 --> 1:08:20.319
I was.

1:08:20.320 --> 1:08:24.079
So, how come your mobile phone
signal puts you miles away,

1:08:24.080 --> 1:08:27.399
near Cal and Oonagh's flat,
where Frank was staying.

1:08:27.400 --> 1:08:30.399
Grandad? Grandad?

1:08:30.400 --> 1:08:32.279
No. He's helping us
with our enquiries, Lyle.

1:08:32.280 --> 1:08:33.959
Mum's having one of her meltdowns.

1:08:33.960 --> 1:08:36.199
HEALEY: We need to speak to him
about your dad.

1:08:36.200 --> 1:08:37.559
Hang on. Hang on...

1:08:37.560 --> 1:08:39.720
How did you know
where to look for Frank?

1:08:43.920 --> 1:08:46.519
It was me. Yeah, I told me mam
where he was staying...

1:08:46.520 --> 1:08:48.119
Why?

1:08:48.120 --> 1:08:51.079
She was upset, missing my dad.
I didn't know what else to do.

1:08:51.080 --> 1:08:52.279
But please can we go?

1:08:52.280 --> 1:08:54.879
That's one hell of a black eye,
Lyle.

1:08:54.880 --> 1:08:57.600
Does your mam often have
these meltdowns?

1:08:59.600 --> 1:09:00.679
Now and again.

1:09:00.680 --> 1:09:02.720
Ah, so, what's triggered this one?

1:09:04.040 --> 1:09:06.039
Something stupid.

1:09:06.040 --> 1:09:07.559
OK, Oonagh came round with flowers.

1:09:07.560 --> 1:09:09.279
And when she'd left,
Mam started ranting

1:09:09.280 --> 1:09:11.399
about how she's
rubbing her face in it.

1:09:11.400 --> 1:09:13.240
What did she mean by that?

1:09:14.520 --> 1:09:15.560
An affair?

1:09:17.360 --> 1:09:18.560
Oh, Julia...

1:09:19.960 --> 1:09:21.240
Well?

1:09:22.440 --> 1:09:24.199
I had no designs on Frank.

1:09:24.200 --> 1:09:26.719
Why would she think that you
and Frank were in a relationship?

1:09:26.720 --> 1:09:27.879
Because she's insecure.

1:09:27.880 --> 1:09:30.719
You know, Frank and I, we came
from very similar backgrounds,

1:09:30.720 --> 1:09:32.119
we were on the same wavelength.

1:09:32.120 --> 1:09:34.279
Julia can be paranoid.
Yeah.

1:09:34.280 --> 1:09:36.079
No, it was Lyle who told us.

1:09:36.080 --> 1:09:38.279
I wasn't sleeping with Frank.

1:09:38.280 --> 1:09:41.239
Look, I would never do anything
to hurt Lyle.

1:09:41.240 --> 1:09:42.719
Well, someone did.

1:09:42.720 --> 1:09:44.959
He turned up at the scrapyard
with a black eye.

1:09:44.960 --> 1:09:46.440
Said it happened down at college.

1:09:47.880 --> 1:09:49.519
That was probably a lie.

1:09:49.520 --> 1:09:51.039
What do you mean by that?

1:09:51.040 --> 1:09:52.839
Don't do this...
This is about Lyle, now.

1:09:52.840 --> 1:09:54.479
Look, one of you
better start talking,

1:09:54.480 --> 1:09:56.160
or you're both down the nick.

1:09:57.760 --> 1:09:59.959
It was one time, erm,

1:09:59.960 --> 1:10:02.119
it was 18 months,
maybe two years ago,

1:10:02.120 --> 1:10:05.479
Frank presented with an
unexplained serious wrist fracture.

1:10:05.480 --> 1:10:07.679
And we, I patched him up.

1:10:07.680 --> 1:10:09.799
Why unexplained?

1:10:09.800 --> 1:10:12.119
Well, he refused to tell us
what had happened.

1:10:12.120 --> 1:10:13.599
Anyway, we agreed, didn't we?

1:10:13.600 --> 1:10:15.399
That we'd never do
anything like that again.

1:10:15.400 --> 1:10:17.240
For Frank's sake,
and for our careers.

1:10:18.600 --> 1:10:20.120
Well, who do you think hurt him?

1:10:21.880 --> 1:10:23.440
Isn't it obvious?

1:10:25.800 --> 1:10:27.200
Ah, about time.

1:10:28.360 --> 1:10:30.119
I'm sitting here like a plum,
waiting.

1:10:30.120 --> 1:10:33.519
Oh, just had to check
a couple of things, Mr Allen.

1:10:33.520 --> 1:10:35.599
I won't keep you here much longer.
BEEP

1:10:35.600 --> 1:10:39.399
Er, commencing interview
with Glynn Allen.

1:10:39.400 --> 1:10:41.919
Now, I don't need to remind you,
you're still under caution.

1:10:41.920 --> 1:10:44.999
Where's my grandson?
Oh, don't worry, he's safe.

1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:48.479
Now, then, Friday -
you went to find Frank.

1:10:48.480 --> 1:10:50.600
No, Julia was worried about him.

1:10:52.160 --> 1:10:54.319
I went to make sure
everything was OK,

1:10:54.320 --> 1:10:56.159
and he wasn't there.

1:10:56.160 --> 1:10:58.359
So, I went back to the, to the yard.

1:10:58.360 --> 1:11:00.040
What d'you mean - "safe"?

1:11:01.160 --> 1:11:03.119
Well, that's some shiner he's got.

1:11:03.120 --> 1:11:07.399
And you think I did it?
Did you?

1:11:07.400 --> 1:11:09.799
I'd never lay a hand on my grandson.

1:11:09.800 --> 1:11:11.039
Well, you've got form.

1:11:11.040 --> 1:11:13.559
Maybe you were punishing him
for keeping Frank's secrets,

1:11:13.560 --> 1:11:14.759
upsetting your daughter?

1:11:14.760 --> 1:11:16.239
Someone assaulted him.

1:11:16.240 --> 1:11:18.439
The same as someone
assaulted Frank!

1:11:18.440 --> 1:11:19.639
I never touched Frank.

1:11:19.640 --> 1:11:22.079
His friends reckon
you're perfectly capable of it.

1:11:22.080 --> 1:11:25.119
They would. Looking down their noses
at anyone not like them.

1:11:25.120 --> 1:11:26.959
OK, if it wasn't you,
who do you think

1:11:26.960 --> 1:11:28.479
might've wanted to hurt him?

1:11:28.480 --> 1:11:30.359
I mean, two members
from the same family.

1:11:30.360 --> 1:11:32.320
It's my fault Frank's dead, OK!

1:11:37.680 --> 1:11:39.720
Would you care to elaborate on that?

1:11:42.160 --> 1:11:43.760
I-I didn't know what to do.

1:11:45.360 --> 1:11:47.999
I should've got help.
Aye, love, you should've.

1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:50.440
But then it was too late.

1:11:51.800 --> 1:11:56.039
She-She-She's a good person,
deep down. I promise you.

1:11:56.040 --> 1:11:57.880
Who's a good person?

1:12:00.880 --> 1:12:03.599
Julia.
Hold on...

1:12:03.600 --> 1:12:07.360
She's just insecure,
needs to be in control, you know.

1:12:08.760 --> 1:12:13.840
So, what happens
when Julia's not in control? Hmm?

1:12:15.960 --> 1:12:18.360
Does she have
one of those meltdowns?

1:12:22.040 --> 1:12:23.800
She's not a monster.

1:12:25.320 --> 1:12:28.879
It all started
with her just shouting at him.

1:12:28.880 --> 1:12:31.559
A little bit of name calling.
Nothing serious...

1:12:31.560 --> 1:12:34.280
It-It just got worse.

1:12:37.040 --> 1:12:39.919
If Frank was late back from work,
or made a mess,

1:12:39.920 --> 1:12:41.600
or said something she didn't like...

1:12:43.840 --> 1:12:45.160
..she'd beat him...

1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:49.720
..sometimes really badly.

1:12:51.720 --> 1:12:53.399
But-But she was always sorry,

1:12:53.400 --> 1:12:56.599
and I told her it weren't right.

1:12:56.600 --> 1:13:00.799
Then she'd start getting upset
and crying, and...

1:13:00.800 --> 1:13:02.559
Like she did when she was little.

1:13:02.560 --> 1:13:05.759
It's to stop you
being angry with her.

1:13:05.760 --> 1:13:09.399
I thought one day
Frank'd stand up for himself,

1:13:09.400 --> 1:13:12.240
and everything'd get sorted.

1:13:13.640 --> 1:13:17.360
Well, maybe he did... on Friday.

1:13:20.880 --> 1:13:22.160
Mr Allen...

1:13:24.760 --> 1:13:28.600
..do you think your daughter
killed Frank?

1:13:41.400 --> 1:13:44.000
Ah, can you tell me about Friday,
pet?

1:13:47.320 --> 1:13:48.480
Frank was leaving me.

1:13:50.640 --> 1:13:53.080
Must've come
as a terrible shock for you.

1:13:58.360 --> 1:14:01.040
I thought he just needed
a bit of time.

1:14:02.720 --> 1:14:04.759
But he only came home
to pick up his things.

1:14:04.760 --> 1:14:06.560
Did he say why?

1:14:08.840 --> 1:14:10.960
We barely had a chance to talk,

1:14:12.120 --> 1:14:15.640
what with Lyle coming home
and Frank getting that message.

1:14:17.400 --> 1:14:18.799
Twenty years of marriage,

1:14:18.800 --> 1:14:22.439
and he can't be bothered
explaining why.

1:14:22.440 --> 1:14:24.159
Mm-hm.

1:14:24.160 --> 1:14:29.080
Was it the beatings you gave him
that made up his mind?

1:14:32.720 --> 1:14:34.919
I don't know
who's been spreading lies...

1:14:34.920 --> 1:14:36.960
Your dad's told us the truth, love.

1:14:39.880 --> 1:14:41.639
He promised.

1:14:41.640 --> 1:14:45.279
So, Friday, er, you want answers,
Frank's left the house,

1:14:45.280 --> 1:14:46.400
what happened next?

1:14:48.560 --> 1:14:49.959
Dad went to the flat.

1:14:49.960 --> 1:14:54.520
So, did you clobber Lyle as well
to get the address out of him?

1:14:57.880 --> 1:15:00.239
SHE WHISPERS: Aye...
He wasn't there.

1:15:00.240 --> 1:15:02.759
So I called the office

1:15:02.760 --> 1:15:06.039
and a colleague told me
he'd taken the afternoon off,

1:15:06.040 --> 1:15:07.359
to go sailing.

1:15:07.360 --> 1:15:09.719
So, you went to the sailing club.

1:15:09.720 --> 1:15:11.599
He was by his boat.

1:15:11.600 --> 1:15:13.240
He looked so happy...

1:15:14.360 --> 1:15:16.400
..and he didn't have a care
in the world.

1:15:18.720 --> 1:15:23.240
I called him all the names
under the sun, and I shoved him.

1:15:24.680 --> 1:15:26.760
He fell, hit his head.

1:15:28.640 --> 1:15:31.080
I went to help,
but he wouldn't let me near him.

1:15:32.440 --> 1:15:35.079
So, is that why you kicked him?
What?

1:15:35.080 --> 1:15:36.520
You kicked him!

1:15:37.920 --> 1:15:39.440
I didn't.

1:15:40.480 --> 1:15:44.480
He didn't want anything from me.
Not even help.

1:15:46.360 --> 1:15:48.679
Well, that must've been
hard to take.

1:15:48.680 --> 1:15:51.520
Nah. It was typical.

1:15:53.400 --> 1:15:55.560
I should've got out years ago.

1:16:00.480 --> 1:16:03.640
SHE QUIETLY SOBS

1:16:07.160 --> 1:16:09.840
Those tears won't wash with me, pet.

1:16:15.880 --> 1:16:17.160
Look...

1:16:18.680 --> 1:16:20.519
..I didn't kill Frank.

1:16:20.520 --> 1:16:22.960
So, you're saying
you just left him there...

1:16:24.880 --> 1:16:26.119
..with a head injury?

1:16:26.120 --> 1:16:29.000
I knew he was gonna
get looked after.

1:16:36.080 --> 1:16:39.599
Now, then, Cal and Oonagh Terry...

1:16:39.600 --> 1:16:42.279
Right, listen to this, Friday,

1:16:42.280 --> 1:16:45.119
Julia's just told us,
she did go down to the sailing club

1:16:45.120 --> 1:16:48.079
to try and persuade her husband
not to divorce her.

1:16:48.080 --> 1:16:49.959
They get into a row,
she pushes him

1:16:49.960 --> 1:16:51.399
and he falls and bangs his head.

1:16:51.400 --> 1:16:52.919
And she just leaves him there...

1:16:52.920 --> 1:16:55.159
Frank's injured,
we know that he calls Cal...

1:16:55.160 --> 1:16:57.599
Who's a nurse.
And his best mate.

1:16:57.600 --> 1:17:00.239
Now, what would you do,
if your best friend called you,

1:17:00.240 --> 1:17:02.039
in a desperate situation?
I'd go over there.

1:17:02.040 --> 1:17:05.159
Of course you would.
Now, if that is what happened,

1:17:05.160 --> 1:17:07.840
why didn't Cal tell us
he saw Frank?

1:17:09.800 --> 1:17:11.839
Get your coat.

1:17:11.840 --> 1:17:13.999
We need to talk to Cal, love,
where is he?

1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:16.519
He's out walking, clearing his head.
What... What's going on?

1:17:16.520 --> 1:17:19.999
Now, we believe Frank planned
to go sailing on Friday,

1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:21.439
but he injured his head.

1:17:21.440 --> 1:17:23.640
And he rang Cal, as you know,
just after three.

1:17:25.320 --> 1:17:28.480
Now, what would Cal's response
have been?

1:17:30.840 --> 1:17:33.400
He would've triaged him
over the phone and got down there.

1:17:36.920 --> 1:17:38.160
Where is he, love?

1:17:39.360 --> 1:17:42.439
Cal would never hurt Frank. Ever.

1:17:42.440 --> 1:17:45.719
If Cal went out to the sailing club
to help Frank,

1:17:45.720 --> 1:17:47.959
he needs to tell us what happened.

1:17:47.960 --> 1:17:50.919
There might be a simple explanation.
He loved Frank.

1:17:50.920 --> 1:17:52.799
Look, I need to speak
to your husband, love.

1:17:52.800 --> 1:17:53.919
Now, where is he?

1:17:53.920 --> 1:17:55.759
Maybe try him
down at the hospital later.

1:17:55.760 --> 1:17:58.640
He's been working double shifts.
Sleeping in the on-call room.

1:18:01.280 --> 1:18:03.840
And how long's he been doing that?

1:18:06.280 --> 1:18:07.760
Last couple of weeks.

1:18:09.680 --> 1:18:10.760
Mrs Terry...

1:18:12.560 --> 1:18:17.239
..Frank's injury on Friday
was concussion,

1:18:17.240 --> 1:18:21.959
and yet when we asked Cal
how Frank was, he said he was fine.

1:18:21.960 --> 1:18:24.680
"Just confirming a night out",
he said.

1:18:26.080 --> 1:18:29.759
You must have misunderstood.
Why would he lie?

1:18:29.760 --> 1:18:31.719
Cos if he went down to see Frank,

1:18:31.720 --> 1:18:35.279
he was probably the last person
to see him alive.

1:18:35.280 --> 1:18:37.879
That's why he lied.
No, because he loved him. He did.

1:18:37.880 --> 1:18:39.679
I-I'm sorry, love.

1:18:39.680 --> 1:18:40.919
No, he did!

1:18:40.920 --> 1:18:43.959
Put out on all units for Cal Terry.

1:18:43.960 --> 1:18:48.120
Cover the hospital, the flat,
anywhere he might've gone.

1:18:52.160 --> 1:18:54.559
SHE SOBS

1:18:54.560 --> 1:18:56.639
A uniform posted at the flat,
no sign of him.

1:18:56.640 --> 1:18:58.679
Nothing on ANPR either.

1:18:58.680 --> 1:19:00.319
Ma'am. Hospital's clear.

1:19:00.320 --> 1:19:02.119
Boss, I think we've got him.

1:19:02.120 --> 1:19:04.479
The women at the lighthouse
just reported seeing a man

1:19:04.480 --> 1:19:07.239
acting strangely on the sea wall.
Matches Cal's description.

1:19:07.240 --> 1:19:09.959
Right. Kenny, alert uniform,

1:19:09.960 --> 1:19:12.840
but tell 'em not to approach
until I get there. Yes, Ma'am.

1:19:53.520 --> 1:19:56.560
INDECIPHERABLE CHATTER

1:20:00.960 --> 1:20:03.200
Where is he?
He's around there!

1:20:04.240 --> 1:20:06.159
Right, thanks, love.

1:20:06.160 --> 1:20:07.520
Wait here.

1:20:18.520 --> 1:20:20.560
OCEAN GENTLY RUMBLES

1:20:26.720 --> 1:20:28.760
SEAGULLS SQUAWK

1:20:35.960 --> 1:20:37.760
Do you wanna talk to me, Cal?

1:20:43.960 --> 1:20:45.040
I'm not a killer.

1:20:46.280 --> 1:20:47.560
No matter what you might think.

1:20:49.880 --> 1:20:51.160
I loved Frank...

1:20:52.760 --> 1:20:54.560
..for more than 25 years.

1:20:56.360 --> 1:20:59.800
Well, I reckon
he thought a lot of you, too.

1:21:00.840 --> 1:21:03.479
Cos after Julia assaulted him,

1:21:03.480 --> 1:21:06.600
he rang the one person
he knew he could trust.

1:21:08.400 --> 1:21:10.519
I was on shift, but, er,

1:21:10.520 --> 1:21:13.040
I dropped everything and
went straight to the sailing club.

1:21:14.840 --> 1:21:16.479
And how was he?

1:21:16.480 --> 1:21:18.479
A bit woozy.

1:21:18.480 --> 1:21:20.319
I told him I should
take him to the hospital,

1:21:20.320 --> 1:21:22.399
but he insisted he was fine,
so, I...

1:21:22.400 --> 1:21:25.160
I stayed with him
and we were just talking and...

1:21:26.680 --> 1:21:28.360
..and he told me
the marriage was over.

1:21:30.200 --> 1:21:31.880
And what was your reaction?

1:21:32.920 --> 1:21:34.040
Relief.

1:21:35.720 --> 1:21:37.280
You know what she did to him.

1:21:38.360 --> 1:21:39.480
She's evil.

1:21:43.160 --> 1:21:47.759
Those two weeks we had together,
when we were in the flat,

1:21:47.760 --> 1:21:50.359
it was like old times...

1:21:50.360 --> 1:21:52.680
laughing,
it was just easy, you know.

1:21:54.560 --> 1:21:58.080
And then one night,
after all these years...

1:21:59.640 --> 1:22:01.560
..I finally kissed him.

1:22:05.560 --> 1:22:09.039
Frank just stared at me, shocked.

1:22:09.040 --> 1:22:10.760
I thought I'd ruined everything.

1:22:12.800 --> 1:22:14.040
And then he kissed me back.

1:22:16.600 --> 1:22:19.240
I've never felt
so completely at home.

1:22:23.640 --> 1:22:26.040
Last Friday at the sailing club...

1:22:27.840 --> 1:22:30.760
..he's acting like
it'd all been a big mistake.

1:22:31.840 --> 1:22:33.439
Like it had never happened.

1:22:33.440 --> 1:22:34.880
Hmph.

1:22:35.880 --> 1:22:40.159
Frank said he'd have to find
somewhere new to live, but I...

1:22:40.160 --> 1:22:41.839
I didn't get it.

1:22:41.840 --> 1:22:43.559
We had the flat.

1:22:43.560 --> 1:22:46.800
I-I-I told him
I was ready to leave Oonagh, but...

1:22:48.400 --> 1:22:50.480
..but he was talking about
him and Lyle.

1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:53.760
I didn't feature in his plans.

1:22:56.320 --> 1:22:58.840
You thought he'd left Julia
for you?

1:23:02.880 --> 1:23:04.639
SNIFFS

1:23:04.640 --> 1:23:06.520
I felt like such a fool.

1:23:07.960 --> 1:23:09.800
The betrayal - it was unbearable.

1:23:11.840 --> 1:23:13.359
He could tell I was upset,

1:23:13.360 --> 1:23:16.359
and as I was about to walk away,
he put his hand on me shoulder,

1:23:16.360 --> 1:23:17.520
but I didn't want his pity.

1:23:19.320 --> 1:23:22.319
So, I turned round and...

1:23:22.320 --> 1:23:24.479
I-I caught him in the face
with my elbow.

1:23:24.480 --> 1:23:25.920
And he went down, and...

1:23:26.960 --> 1:23:28.000
It was an accident.

1:23:29.440 --> 1:23:31.559
He swore at me,

1:23:31.560 --> 1:23:34.600
and he said,
"You're as bad as Julia".

1:23:36.120 --> 1:23:37.920
I mean,
how could he compare me to her?!

1:23:40.200 --> 1:23:43.080
And I felt this rage.

1:23:44.520 --> 1:23:46.080
Before he could even get up...

1:23:48.400 --> 1:23:49.720
..I kicked him.

1:23:50.760 --> 1:23:53.320
Just the once. But so hard.

1:23:58.440 --> 1:24:00.120
How could I do that?

1:24:04.560 --> 1:24:05.720
And then what?

1:24:09.240 --> 1:24:12.879
I told him I was so sorry,
I tried to help him up,

1:24:12.880 --> 1:24:15.279
but he... he didn't want me
anywhere near him.

1:24:15.280 --> 1:24:17.280
He said he didn't even know
who I was anymore.

1:24:18.640 --> 1:24:21.880
So, I went off, just...
just to calm down, you know.

1:24:23.800 --> 1:24:25.879
Then I realised, I had blood on me.

1:24:25.880 --> 1:24:29.400
Er... Frank's blood.

1:24:30.680 --> 1:24:33.879
So, I rushed back to him and...

1:24:33.880 --> 1:24:36.320
and... there was no pulse.

1:24:38.440 --> 1:24:40.359
Poor Frank.

1:24:40.360 --> 1:24:42.000
I didn't know what to do.

1:24:43.880 --> 1:24:45.999
But what you did do

1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:48.879
was dump his body
into the boot of his car

1:24:48.880 --> 1:24:50.479
and drive off.

1:24:50.480 --> 1:24:53.359
I loved him.
I didn't mean to kill him.

1:24:53.360 --> 1:24:55.920
Then stop romanticising, pet.

1:24:56.920 --> 1:24:59.199
You kicked him so hard,

1:24:59.200 --> 1:25:02.399
his lungs were punctured
and collapsed.

1:25:02.400 --> 1:25:03.960
Now, you could've got help.

1:25:05.080 --> 1:25:07.959
But, no, you were too busy
covering your tracks.

1:25:07.960 --> 1:25:11.079
You even texted Julia
from Frank's phone,

1:25:11.080 --> 1:25:14.559
making her think he was alive
and going off sailing.

1:25:14.560 --> 1:25:16.839
I felt detached,

1:25:16.840 --> 1:25:19.559
like it was happening
to someone else, I..

1:25:19.560 --> 1:25:21.079
I sat in the car for hours.

1:25:21.080 --> 1:25:23.319
Yeah, waiting for it to get dark,

1:25:23.320 --> 1:25:25.839
so you could dispose
of your best friend's body.

1:25:25.840 --> 1:25:30.199
You hauled him onto his boat
and pushed him out on the tide,

1:25:30.200 --> 1:25:32.920
hoping his death
couldn't be traced back to you.

1:25:35.240 --> 1:25:37.279
Ah, save it, love.

1:25:37.280 --> 1:25:40.159
You robbed a son of his father.

1:25:40.160 --> 1:25:43.079
HE SOBS

1:25:43.080 --> 1:25:47.400
And you were right, what Julia did,
it was unforgivable...

1:25:48.760 --> 1:25:50.640
..but here's the thing, love...

1:25:51.600 --> 1:25:53.920
..you're the one who killed him.

1:26:00.160 --> 1:26:01.599
HEALEY: Callum Terry,

1:26:01.600 --> 1:26:04.079
I'm arresting you for the murder
of Frank Channing.

1:26:04.080 --> 1:26:05.679
You do not have to say anything,

1:26:05.680 --> 1:26:07.559
but it may harm your defence

1:26:07.560 --> 1:26:09.239
if you do not mention
when questioned

1:26:09.240 --> 1:26:10.960
something you later rely on
in court...

1:26:19.920 --> 1:26:21.400
Poor old Frank, eh.

1:26:22.720 --> 1:26:24.359
Where does that leave his son?

1:26:24.360 --> 1:26:26.440
Aye, it's going to be tough on Lyle.

1:26:27.640 --> 1:26:31.560
And he's going to come to realise
his dad wasn't weak at all.

1:26:32.960 --> 1:26:35.959
Hey, come on. I'll drop you home.

1:26:35.960 --> 1:26:39.360
Maybe you can get in some
quality time with your bairn.

1:27:00.560 --> 1:27:02.120
CALLUM: Ah, wait here.

1:27:07.960 --> 1:27:10.760
Relax, I'm not coming to arrest you.

1:27:14.480 --> 1:27:15.960
How's he doing?

1:27:17.040 --> 1:27:18.280
Ah. Doesn't say much.

1:27:19.800 --> 1:27:22.599
Well, this is Frank's fleece,
it was on Lyle's boat.

1:27:22.600 --> 1:27:24.160
The lad's been waiting for it.

1:27:25.640 --> 1:27:26.960
Look after him.

1:27:35.760 --> 1:27:37.160
A present for you.
