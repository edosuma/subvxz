WEBVTT

00:04.105 --> 00:05.738
Okay. What do we got?

00:05.740 --> 00:08.106
Patient called 9-1-1 for acute
onset worst headache of life.

00:08.109 --> 00:10.192
Nausea and visual changes.

00:10.193 --> 00:12.276
B.P.'s 147/89, heart rate's
sinus, tach in the 120s.

00:12.279 --> 00:15.114
Help me.
Everything's blurry.

00:15.116 --> 00:16.582
I-I... my hand is numb.

00:16.584 --> 00:17.973
Okay, possible aneurysm.

00:17.974 --> 00:19.363
Let's go straight to C.T.,
and then I'll tap her.

00:19.364 --> 00:20.753
Wait, I have a backpack.
Don't worry.

00:20.755 --> 00:22.454
No, I came in with
a red backpack.

00:22.456 --> 00:25.090
The medics will bring it
right in. Don't worry about it.

00:25.092 --> 00:27.059
You need to go back to
the exam room, Mr. Neville.

00:27.061 --> 00:30.529
Hey, I like how you look
in those scrubs.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.665
Thank you.
But we bring the test to you.

00:33.667 --> 00:37.102
I don't want you to put anything
up my bottom.

00:37.104 --> 00:39.304
We'll try not to.

00:39.306 --> 00:41.707
I just need you to go back
and sit and wait for me.

00:41.709 --> 00:44.109
I'll wait for you all night.

00:44.111 --> 00:45.611
Okay.
Great. Fine.

00:45.613 --> 00:48.147
Uh, actually... whoa. Um...

00:48.149 --> 00:49.715
Over there.

00:49.717 --> 00:52.651
Oh, yeah.
Just... Getting my bearings.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.119
Okay. Right there.

00:54.121 --> 00:56.121
Can we stay out here
a little longer?

00:56.123 --> 00:57.790
I hate being stuck in my room.

00:57.792 --> 01:01.427
I know you do.
It's just what's best for you.

01:01.429 --> 01:05.129
But here, I do have something
for you.

01:05.132 --> 01:08.067
Something even better than
a parking lot full of sun?

01:08.069 --> 01:09.234
I don't think so.

01:09.236 --> 01:12.104
Hmm? Don't be so sure.

01:12.106 --> 01:14.740
What... Is that...
Turkish delight.

01:14.742 --> 01:17.076
Just don't go selling out
to the ice queen like Edmund.

01:17.078 --> 01:18.427
Never.

01:18.428 --> 01:19.777
You can have some after
your percussion therapy.

01:19.780 --> 01:21.146
You gotta wait for me, though.

01:21.148 --> 01:22.848
Not now? Man.

01:22.850 --> 01:25.284
Man. Ugh. No. Now.

01:25.286 --> 01:27.786
Mm.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.721
Ooh!

01:33.661 --> 01:35.828
Let's get you back,

01:35.830 --> 01:37.696
get you
to your breathing treatment.

01:37.698 --> 01:40.833
Okay.

01:40.835 --> 01:42.985
Do we have any more signs?

01:42.986 --> 01:45.136
What are they doing out here?
And in their regular clothes?

01:45.139 --> 01:47.206
We are on strike, honey.

01:48.375 --> 01:50.442
It's like seeing your teacher
at the grocery store.

01:50.444 --> 01:51.810
In her underwear.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.612
The hospital promised us raises
three years ago

01:53.614 --> 01:55.347
and still hasn't
followed through.

01:55.349 --> 01:57.783
And they always have us
working shorthanded.

01:57.785 --> 02:00.119
Do you have anything to do
with this?

02:00.121 --> 02:02.254
I do not, ma'am. No way.

02:02.256 --> 02:04.189
In fact, they're the real
bosses. Don't forget that.

02:04.191 --> 02:06.125
We're all on your sides.
Good luck.

02:06.127 --> 02:07.226
- Thanks, drew.
- Bye, guys.

02:07.228 --> 02:08.526
All right.
Hey, Bri.

02:08.529 --> 02:09.862
Hey, Dr. Toph.
Hey.

02:11.432 --> 02:13.365
And what do you want?

02:13.367 --> 02:15.501
You could catch more flies
with honey, Mollie.

02:15.503 --> 02:19.238
Oh, so now I'm supposed
to provide you honey?

02:19.240 --> 02:20.906
I just need you to tell me
where the EKG paper is

02:20.908 --> 02:23.175
and the handheld urinals.

02:23.177 --> 02:26.178
Ask the scabs
you called in to replace us.

02:26.180 --> 02:27.713
Throw me a bone, ladies.

02:27.715 --> 02:30.916
Only two scabs have shown.
We're on the same side.

02:30.918 --> 02:33.418
We're all getting screwed
by the hospital.

02:33.420 --> 02:35.697
Some of us are getting screwed
just a little bit more, Toph.

02:35.721 --> 02:36.455
Yeah.

02:36.457 --> 02:39.491
Come on. It's the patients
getting screwed now.

02:39.493 --> 02:42.261
You're really gonna go there?
You're gonna put that on us?

02:42.263 --> 02:44.830
You need to take those handheld urinals

02:44.832 --> 02:47.733
and shove them
straight up your...

02:49.203 --> 02:51.236
If could find them, you know?
But...

02:51.238 --> 02:53.839
Okay, I need you to draw
a rainbow on Mr. Neville

02:53.841 --> 02:55.274
and get it to the lab stat.

02:55.276 --> 02:56.375
Absolutely.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.210
Um, where are
the I.V. Start kits

02:58.212 --> 02:59.545
and the saline bags?

02:59.547 --> 03:01.547
Yeah, uh, they're in
the supply chest

03:01.549 --> 03:03.582
down the hall.
Which supply chest?

03:03.584 --> 03:05.350
And where's the lab?

03:05.352 --> 03:06.752
Should I be taking notes?

03:06.754 --> 03:07.920
Uh, never mind. Never mind.
Uh, Shannon.

03:07.922 --> 03:09.388
Can you draw blood
on Mr. Neville?

03:09.390 --> 03:12.191
Yeah, but, uh... Shoot.

03:12.193 --> 03:13.292
What?

03:13.294 --> 03:15.427
Paul. Over there.
So?

03:15.429 --> 03:16.929
So I sort of slept with him.

03:16.931 --> 03:18.664
What?

03:18.666 --> 03:20.766
I already regret it, so a little
less shock would be appreciated.

03:20.768 --> 03:22.601
How did this even happen?

03:22.603 --> 03:24.603
A little vulnerability,
maybe some hormones.

03:24.605 --> 03:26.271
But now he's gonna get
all weird and clingy

03:26.273 --> 03:27.773
and maybe even cry
in front of me.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.358
I mean, you know him,

03:29.359 --> 03:30.942
and I really don't need that
this morning, so...

03:30.945 --> 03:32.444
Hey.

03:32.446 --> 03:33.912
Hey.

03:36.217 --> 03:38.817
Mm, seems fine.

03:38.819 --> 03:41.220
Oh, my god, I was dying.

03:41.222 --> 03:42.521
Man, be cool.

03:42.523 --> 03:43.822
Yeah, I just...
I don't want her to think that

03:43.824 --> 03:46.258
I'm not interested, you know,
because I am.

03:46.260 --> 03:48.527
I mean, like, really interested.

03:48.529 --> 03:50.429
M-maybe I should...
You know what?

03:50.431 --> 03:51.930
I'm gonna... I'm gonna text her
and explain... look, hey, hey.

03:51.932 --> 03:53.365
You did... you did me this favor
in return for my advice,

03:53.367 --> 03:54.866
so I'm gonna something for you.

03:54.868 --> 03:55.968
Give me your phone.

03:55.970 --> 03:57.369
Wait. Oh, no... okay.

03:57.371 --> 03:59.871
Man, hey,
play it cool, all right?

03:59.873 --> 04:00.906
She thinks you're too into her,

04:00.908 --> 04:02.941
she'll drop you
like a bad habit.

04:02.943 --> 04:05.577
Now just remember what
I told you.

04:05.579 --> 04:08.013
That women...
Women play the game.

04:08.015 --> 04:09.448
Right, exactly. You got it.
Okay.

04:09.450 --> 04:11.383
So... so keep it cool, man.
Trust me.

04:11.385 --> 04:12.718
I promise you, it works.
All right?

04:12.720 --> 04:14.353
Right.

04:14.355 --> 04:16.288
Can I talk to you, Kenny?
Privately?

04:16.290 --> 04:17.589
Yeah.

04:20.293 --> 04:21.692
I might need my phone, though.

04:25.399 --> 04:27.933
Hey, you... you know I was
just playing, right, Joce?

04:27.935 --> 04:30.002
Yeah, I don't care about that.
That's after hours.

04:30.004 --> 04:32.037
But right now,
you're our union liaison.

04:32.039 --> 04:34.339
We've walked out
and you're walking in?

04:34.341 --> 04:37.009
Oh, no, I'm not here to nurse.
No, I'm here for Lauren.

04:37.011 --> 04:38.661
You know, she's the...

04:38.662 --> 04:40.312
The high school soccer star
I've been training.

04:40.314 --> 04:42.581
She's been sick for weeks.
She might have pneumonia.

04:42.583 --> 04:44.883
She has practice,
then school, practice,

04:44.885 --> 04:46.618
and so this is the only time
she could come by.

04:46.620 --> 04:47.919
There are other people here
to help.

04:47.921 --> 04:50.355
The scabs?
Oh, no, no, no. No, no.

04:50.357 --> 04:52.424
No, she's come way too far
to get lost in the shuffle.

04:52.426 --> 04:54.426
There's a recruiter coming
on Thursday.

04:54.428 --> 04:57.663
She's got a shot to be the first
in the family to go to college.

04:57.665 --> 05:00.032
But she's gotta be on, not sick.

05:00.034 --> 05:02.768
I heard that.
And I'm not sick.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.469
I'm just feeling a little tired

05:04.471 --> 05:06.004
'cause you work my ass
into the ground.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.732
I only give you what
I know you can handle.

05:07.757 --> 05:08.307
Mm.

05:08.309 --> 05:09.841
Okay, well, I get it.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.576
So get her checked in

05:11.578 --> 05:14.513
and get your butt outside
on the line.

05:17.318 --> 05:18.583
My bad.

05:18.585 --> 05:20.018
Did I get you in trouble
with your girlfriend?

05:20.020 --> 05:21.620
Nah, it's just some work stuff.
Mm-hmm.

05:21.622 --> 05:23.322
And she's not my girlfriend.

05:23.324 --> 05:24.956
Oh, so is that why she hangs
around the gym all the time?

05:24.958 --> 05:26.825
It's just work stuff?
That's cool.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.860
Mind your own business.- -

05:28.862 --> 05:30.529
- Let's get you in to Dr. Cummings.
- Yeah, all right, coach.

05:30.531 --> 05:32.097
Oh, hold on.

05:32.099 --> 05:35.634
- It's a mom check in. I gotta take this.
- Yeah.

05:35.636 --> 05:37.369
Hey, ma.

05:38.605 --> 05:41.106
Um, uh, where's the ambulance
that brought me in?

05:41.108 --> 05:43.342
In the parking lot.
This is sort of my first day...

05:43.344 --> 05:45.444
No, I gotta find my backpack.
Well, I could get that for...

05:45.446 --> 05:47.446
Okay, maybe not.

05:47.448 --> 05:48.980
You better get your ass
out there, Kenny.

05:48.982 --> 05:52.417
Mollie's gonna kill you.
Oh, uh, EKG paper?

05:52.419 --> 05:53.886
Please help me.

05:53.887 --> 05:55.354
Oh, under the counter
in the box marked "EKG paper."

05:55.356 --> 05:57.856
Have you seen Paul?
No.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.558
We need to get our nurses back.

05:59.560 --> 06:00.826
Tell management, not us.

06:00.828 --> 06:02.461
Yeah, we did.

06:02.462 --> 06:04.095
Management's taking their own
sweet time with negotiations.

06:04.098 --> 06:06.398
Okay, has anybody seen
my patient?

06:06.400 --> 06:07.566
I dropped her off in C.T.
five minutes ago.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.968
She went to go get her backpack.

06:09.970 --> 06:12.804
Sorry, you let a patient
that came in, in an ambulance

06:12.806 --> 06:14.573
walk out of the E.R.?

06:14.575 --> 06:17.476
Oh. I-i, uh...

06:17.478 --> 06:20.078
To get the backpack that's
right there at your feet?

06:20.080 --> 06:21.480
Oh, jeez.

06:21.482 --> 06:24.149
The paramedics
must've brought that in.

06:24.151 --> 06:26.451
I-I'll go take it
back to her.

06:29.423 --> 06:30.555
Where's the John?

06:30.557 --> 06:33.125
No, Mr. Neville.

06:33.127 --> 06:35.060
Uh, did you see a woman
come out here?

06:35.062 --> 06:37.429
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, ma.
Okay.

06:37.431 --> 06:39.498
Yeah, I'll be home soon.
Yeah, bye.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.061
Lauren! Lauren!

07:43.063 --> 07:45.063
- Mr. Neville?
- Mr. Neville!

07:45.065 --> 07:47.966
Lauren!

07:47.968 --> 07:50.635
Lauren!

07:52.639 --> 07:54.473
Lauren!

07:54.475 --> 07:57.075
Lauren! Oh, god. Oh, god.

07:57.077 --> 08:00.111
You're okay, Lauren.
It's gonna be okay. You're okay.

08:00.113 --> 08:03.548
It's gonna be okay. Wake up. Wake up!

08:08.789 --> 08:10.155
Come on, Lauren. I got you.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.990
Aah! My leg. My leg.
My leg!

08:13.228 --> 08:14.559
- I got you.
- Aah! My leg!

08:14.561 --> 08:17.062
Oh, god!
Help! I need help! Tee!

08:17.064 --> 08:21.233
Tee, I need you!

08:26.106 --> 08:28.573
Okay. You're okay.
Her leg is hemorrhaging.

08:28.575 --> 08:30.208
We need to get a tourniquet on it.

08:30.210 --> 08:32.744
- Hand me that blood pressure cuff. Go.
- Aah!

08:36.950 --> 08:38.833
I got you, okay.

08:38.835 --> 08:40.719
I need you to get me a milligram
of Dilaudid or morphine,

08:40.721 --> 08:42.988
whatever you can get.
All right. Okay.

08:45.659 --> 08:46.758
We were in pre-op
when we heard the explosion.

08:46.760 --> 08:47.959
What the hell happened?

08:47.961 --> 08:49.878
It's an I.E.D.
Pipe bomb, pressure cooker.

08:49.879 --> 08:51.796
- It was filled with bolts, I think.
- Was this a terrorist act?

08:51.798 --> 08:53.198
I think we gotta assume
the worst.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.233
Okay, Kenny's off to get
some drugs, all right?

08:55.235 --> 08:58.737
He's so slow. I...
I can beat him in my sleep.

08:58.739 --> 09:01.006
Attagirl. Attagirl.

09:01.008 --> 09:03.909
You're gonna be okay.
Here he comes.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.881
Hey. We gotta get her leg
to the O.R., okay.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.917
Get me a gurney now.
Okay.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.159
Wait, I have a backpack.

09:21.160 --> 09:22.326
- Don't worry.
- No, I came in with a red backpack.

09:22.329 --> 09:24.863
The medics will bring it
right in.

09:32.606 --> 09:34.339
I got you.

09:34.341 --> 09:36.174
Yeah, this way.

09:36.176 --> 09:38.343
Can you walk?

09:38.345 --> 09:40.045
We need to get these victims
treated, account for survivors.

09:40.047 --> 09:41.246
No, we need to clear
a perimeter.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.248
We're not the cavalry, drew.
We're doctors.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.067
Listen up!

09:45.068 --> 09:46.885
If you're hurt or bleeding,
we're gonna help you.

09:46.887 --> 09:48.186
But if you can move at all,

09:48.188 --> 09:49.654
you need to move towards
the elevators,

09:49.656 --> 09:51.089
away from points of access.

09:53.142 --> 09:55.192
- Open tib-fib fracture.
- Yeah, I agree.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.262
Uh, possibly grade 3,
lots of contamination.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.064
Let's get her up to the O.R.
let's go.

09:59.065 --> 10:00.865
Hold on, hold on, hold on!
SWAT is sealing off everything.

10:00.867 --> 10:02.233
We can't go up to the O.R.

10:02.235 --> 10:03.835
You've gotta be kidding me, man!

10:03.837 --> 10:05.737
I think I know who did this,
okay? She was my patient.

10:05.739 --> 10:06.905
She had a red backpack.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.840
It was large enough to have
a pipe bomb.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.141
That's what I'm saying.
Okay, that's what terrorists do.

10:10.143 --> 10:11.810
They wait for first responders
to arrive,

10:11.812 --> 10:13.778
they detonate a second device.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.280
- Yeah, I saw that in "the hurt locker."
- Yeah, and I, I lived it.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.215
They could also be waiting
for us to load our patients

10:17.217 --> 10:20.018
- into ambulances and pick us off outside.
- Well, you gotta make a call.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.886
Topher, we gotta do surgery
right now.

10:21.888 --> 10:23.030
Come on, come on, Topher. What

10:23.054 --> 10:24.322
are we gonna do? Come on, Toph.

10:24.324 --> 10:25.690
We're staying here.
No!

10:25.692 --> 10:27.125
You're wrong, okay?
We gotta go back...

10:27.127 --> 10:29.127
We could lose people
in the transfer!

10:29.129 --> 10:30.862
I'm your commanding officer
here.

10:30.864 --> 10:32.631
Until SWAT secures
the perimeter,

10:32.633 --> 10:35.700
we keep everybody safe.
We need to know what's going on.

10:35.702 --> 10:37.402
All right, Kenny, trauma 2,
that's our new O.R.

10:37.404 --> 10:39.270
Tee, go give SWAT a description.

10:39.272 --> 10:42.140
Everybody else,
continue triaging.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.376
We gotta go to trauma!

10:47.814 --> 10:50.148
Multiple lacerations
with deep glass under the skin.

10:50.150 --> 10:53.118
We need to get this cleaned out.

10:54.187 --> 10:57.689
Hey. Are you okay?

10:57.691 --> 11:00.025
No. No, I'm not okay.
I'm scared to death.

11:00.027 --> 11:03.995
Shannon, you can be scared,
but you need to focus.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.730
Aren't you freaked out?

11:05.732 --> 11:09.100
Yes, but we have a job to do.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.736
Okay, I need you to go and get
suture kits, kerlix rolls,

11:11.738 --> 11:13.838
and all the o-neg you can find.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.306
Yeah. Yeah, okay.
You good?

11:15.308 --> 11:17.308
Uh-huh.
Okay, go, quickly.

11:22.164 --> 11:23.947
I can't get to you now, Bri.
It's all closed off.

11:23.950 --> 11:26.084
<i>I'm scared.</i>

11:26.086 --> 11:29.788
<i>There's no nurses
and no doctors.</i>

11:29.790 --> 11:31.289
<i>No you.</i>

11:31.291 --> 11:33.258
<i>I know. I know.
But I called up</i>

11:33.260 --> 11:34.292
<i>some of the orderlies
who work up there.</i>

11:34.294 --> 11:35.994
<i>They're gonna come hang out.</i>

11:35.996 --> 11:37.295
<i>I gotta work now, okay?</i>

11:37.297 --> 11:39.330
<i>Okay.</i>

11:39.332 --> 11:40.632
<i>I'll tell you what.</i>

11:40.633 --> 11:41.933
<i>You can have some of that
Turkish delight now.</i>

11:41.935 --> 11:44.402
<i>How does that sound?
Great.</i>

11:44.404 --> 11:46.838
<i>Except I left it down there.</i>

11:46.840 --> 11:49.140
I'll get some up to you
as soon as I can. I promise.

11:50.343 --> 11:51.943
Okay.

11:55.248 --> 11:56.715
Achilles tendon rupture

11:56.717 --> 12:00.218
and she's got a tear
to her popliteal artery.

12:00.220 --> 12:03.154
Got sterile gowns,
sterile drapes, a ventilator.

12:03.156 --> 12:04.456
I saw an orthopedics kit
outside.

12:04.458 --> 12:06.708
Kenny, you need to go rest
that shoulder.

12:06.709 --> 12:07.477
Yeah, you landed pretty hard.

12:07.502 --> 12:08.959
Look, look, look, I'm the
only nurse you guys got.

12:08.962 --> 12:10.762
So let's just focus on Lauren.

12:10.764 --> 12:12.063
Okay, I'm gonna place
an ex-fix,

12:12.065 --> 12:13.765
hopefully stabilize
this leg enough

12:13.767 --> 12:15.233
to avoid any more
vascular injury.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.235
Go grab that kit.
All right.

12:19.139 --> 12:20.405
We need some extra hands.

12:20.407 --> 12:21.673
And Shannon could use help

12:21.674 --> 12:22.940
pulling glass out
of Mr. Neville.

12:22.943 --> 12:25.176
The E.R.'s sealed off,
so it's just us.

12:25.178 --> 12:27.378
Paul, I got this. Go help.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.180
Okay, okay. Of course.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.820
Just got word
from the parking lot.

12:35.822 --> 12:38.356
We found a woman fitting your
description sitting in a truck.

12:38.358 --> 12:39.791
What can I do?

12:39.792 --> 12:41.225
There may be more casualties
out there.

12:41.228 --> 12:43.468
When they're ready out there,
you should go. We got this.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.531
Okay.

12:57.310 --> 13:00.278
Driver, step out of the vehicle!

13:07.287 --> 13:10.188
Step out of the vehicle!

13:18.098 --> 13:19.464
Show me your hands!

13:23.270 --> 13:26.471
Walk toward my voice. Slowly.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.941
I said slowly!

13:31.545 --> 13:33.945
Stop!

13:33.947 --> 13:36.047
Get on your knees! Stop!

13:36.049 --> 13:39.484
I said stop!

13:39.486 --> 13:40.885
Do it!

13:40.887 --> 13:45.290
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em!

13:48.829 --> 13:49.696
Stop! What the
hell are you doing?!

13:49.721 --> 13:50.829
I don't get to her,
she's gonna bleed out.

13:50.831 --> 13:53.198
- And you care?!
- No, I only care if there's another bomb.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.560
She's the only one
who can tell us.

14:01.575 --> 14:02.974
Aah! That hurts! It hurts!

14:02.976 --> 14:04.242
Yeah? It's gonna hurt
a whole lot more

14:04.244 --> 14:06.277
if you don't tell me
if there's another bomb.

14:06.279 --> 14:08.012
You can't do that.
You're a doctor.

14:08.014 --> 14:09.113
No, no,
it's just you and me here.

14:09.115 --> 14:11.082
I can do what I want.
Ow!

14:11.084 --> 14:12.383
I can pull this out
the hard way.

14:13.886 --> 14:15.386
There's no more bomb.
There's no other bomb. I swear.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.021
Please stop!

14:17.023 --> 14:18.590
Now why did you do this?

14:18.592 --> 14:20.558
Because you deserved it!

14:30.503 --> 14:32.437
White count's over 20,000.

14:34.507 --> 14:37.275
It could be a reaction
to the trauma...

14:37.277 --> 14:39.310
Possibly from the pneumonia.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.646
Okay, we're all set here.
Let's check her pulse.

14:49.556 --> 14:52.056
Nothing,
just enlarged lymph nodes.

15:01.601 --> 15:04.002
Nothing.

15:04.004 --> 15:07.972
We need to do a fem-pop bypass
so she doesn't lose this leg.

15:07.974 --> 15:10.041
Get me an 11 blade
and 7-0 Prolene.

15:24.057 --> 15:26.190
This her?
Yeah.

15:26.192 --> 15:27.992
Shot twice,
hollow point bullets.

15:27.994 --> 15:29.661
I need a chest tube,
an intubation tray,

15:29.663 --> 15:31.813
and four units of prbcs.

15:31.814 --> 15:33.428
Of all the days for the
nurses to not be here.

15:33.452 --> 15:34.452
Yep.

15:34.668 --> 15:37.702
One bullet left axillae.
One right thigh.

15:40.073 --> 15:42.273
No breath sounds on the left.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.008
Damn it. You know,
this is all my fault.

15:44.010 --> 15:46.544
The collapsed lung? No.
Let's place a chest tube.

15:46.546 --> 15:49.380
I saw her.
What?

15:49.382 --> 15:52.517
She was my patient.
She wanted her backpack.

15:52.519 --> 15:55.119
I didn't put it together.
Well, why would you?

15:55.121 --> 15:57.722
Oh, you know, she was sweating,
acting strange.

15:57.724 --> 16:00.224
Tee, that describes 90%
of the people who come in here.

16:00.226 --> 16:03.027
Yeah, I just... I just didn't
think, you know? Didn't...

16:03.029 --> 16:05.330
Didn't think I'd be in danger
in my own hospital.

16:05.332 --> 16:06.731
It's not a war zone.

16:06.733 --> 16:10.368
You take on a lot.
Do not take on this.

16:13.006 --> 16:16.274
You know,
I spoke to her outside.

16:16.276 --> 16:19.277
She said we got what
we deserved.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.478
She said a hospital
deserved this?

16:20.480 --> 16:23.014
That's what she said.
Who knows, right?

16:23.016 --> 16:25.216
I mean, these days,
anybody can do it.

16:25.218 --> 16:28.319
There's bomb recipes on
a thousand different web sites.

16:31.091 --> 16:32.623
Such a sad face.

16:34.027 --> 16:36.527
Yeah. A lot of sad faces
around here tonight.

16:38.398 --> 16:41.065
Let's keep her alive.

16:41.067 --> 16:44.068
I want to hear what we did to deserve this.

16:48.575 --> 16:51.075
- This one's gonna need some deep sutures.
- Yeah.

16:52.779 --> 16:55.646
Hey. You're doing great.

16:55.648 --> 16:59.017
You know, just take it slow.

16:59.019 --> 17:01.486
How are you not freaked out?

17:01.488 --> 17:03.287
Who says I'm not?

17:03.289 --> 17:06.691
You know, I remember
the first time I was bombed.

17:06.693 --> 17:10.795
It was in the sugar mill
just west of Saigon.

17:10.797 --> 17:14.132
And I actually pissed myself.

17:14.134 --> 17:17.602
Of course, I told the other
soldiers that it was just sweat.

17:17.604 --> 17:21.172
But... Now you don't smell
as if you've pissed yourself.

17:21.174 --> 17:22.507
I didn't.

17:22.509 --> 17:24.041
Mr. Neville, um,
how about you just, uh,

17:24.044 --> 17:26.243
try and get some rest,
all right? Save your energy.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.313
One moment.

17:29.315 --> 17:30.648
Yeah.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.250
He's really out of it.

17:32.252 --> 17:34.318
Early Alzheimer's,
maybe dementia?

17:34.320 --> 17:36.320
Hey, how long have you two
been married?

17:38.158 --> 17:40.491
Uh, we're... we're not married.

17:40.493 --> 17:42.527
Oh. Racial issues?

17:42.529 --> 17:44.095
Nope.

17:44.097 --> 17:46.831
I remember when I was
in college,

17:46.833 --> 17:50.134
I liked a beautiful negro girl.

17:50.136 --> 17:52.503
She was as dark as ebony.

17:52.505 --> 17:55.506
And the sexual acrobatics...

17:55.508 --> 17:58.309
That's not it, Mr. Neville.
We just work together.

17:58.311 --> 17:59.444
Exactly.
And that's all.

17:59.446 --> 18:00.645
That's it.
That's, uh, that's all.

18:00.647 --> 18:02.613
Oh. Uh-huh.

18:02.615 --> 18:05.350
Hmm.
Okay, let's...

18:05.351 --> 18:07.402
Let's get this glass out
of your ass, Mr. Neville.

18:07.427 --> 18:08.086
Yeah.

18:08.088 --> 18:10.521
Angela Wei?

18:10.523 --> 18:12.690
Angela Wei?

18:12.692 --> 18:15.526
Uh, I think she was in my room,
right? She was really sick.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.295
Uh, there was so much smoke,

18:17.297 --> 18:18.596
we had to move a bunch of
gurneys into the break room.

18:18.598 --> 18:21.699
This is taking forever.
My grandpa is missing.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.234
Look, everybody,

18:23.236 --> 18:26.237
the SWAT team has
let in some first responders,

18:26.239 --> 18:27.872
but they're still sweeping
the building.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.774
So once we get a final count,

18:29.776 --> 18:32.243
we can start evacuating
those with I.D.S.

18:32.245 --> 18:33.644
All for your own safety.
You just have to be patient.

18:33.646 --> 18:35.880
No. I want to know now.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.849
We've been scared, waiting,

18:37.851 --> 18:40.118
and now you're taking roll like
we're a bunch of kindergartners.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.452
Yeah.

18:41.454 --> 18:44.122
Hey, hey, ma'am, listen.
He's just trying to help.

18:44.124 --> 18:45.957
You guys need to take a breath.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.791
You don't give a crap
about our families.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.727
He does.

18:49.729 --> 18:52.463
Your grandfather,
Daniel Rodriguez?

18:52.465 --> 18:55.266
He snuck out to have a smoke
early this morning, okay?

18:55.268 --> 18:56.834
I saw him myself.

18:56.836 --> 18:58.736
Everyone outside was evacuated

18:58.738 --> 19:00.238
to a gym
at the community center.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.273
I'll call over there, okay?
Thank god.

19:02.275 --> 19:04.575
We've been trying to get back in
since the explosion.

19:04.577 --> 19:08.312
The strike can shove it
on a day like this.

19:08.314 --> 19:10.248
Hey, is, uh, Kenny doing okay?

19:10.250 --> 19:11.508
Uh, trauma 2 with Scott. Yeah,

19:11.533 --> 19:12.850
he's okay.
Okay.

19:12.852 --> 19:13.845
- His friend Lauren?

19:13.870 --> 19:15.186
- Not so much.
- Thanks.

19:15.188 --> 19:18.689
Okay, well, we got it from here.
You get back to the patients.

19:18.691 --> 19:21.359
Everybody else, listen up. We're
gonna tell you what's happening.

19:22.428 --> 19:24.328
Okay, what can I do
for you guys?

19:24.330 --> 19:25.563
Oh, you're a sight
for sore eyes.

19:25.565 --> 19:27.298
Uh, can we get a tetanus shot
for Mr. Neville

19:27.300 --> 19:28.533
before we discharge him?
Yes.

19:28.535 --> 19:29.700
Thank you.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.335
Are you okay, Mr. Neville?

19:31.337 --> 19:34.272
I don't feel so good.
It's... it's itching.

19:34.274 --> 19:36.607
It's awful! Get it off of me!
Whoa, whoa, let's not do this.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.309
Blistering on the stitches,
oozing.

19:38.311 --> 19:40.845
Could be allergic to
the stitches

19:40.847 --> 19:42.680
or maybe the shrapnel?

19:42.682 --> 19:44.382
It's all right.

19:46.286 --> 19:47.418
Whoa.

19:50.290 --> 19:53.391
Uh, okay. Um...

19:53.393 --> 19:55.459
Mr. Neville,
we will be right back.

19:55.461 --> 19:57.195
What? Where are you going?

20:00.900 --> 20:02.433
<i>All non-injured</i>

20:02.435 --> 20:04.268
<i>may evacuate the hospital
at this time.</i>

20:04.270 --> 20:06.237
Hey, stop, stop! Topher! Hey.

20:06.239 --> 20:08.339
What? What? What is it?
Anthrax.

20:08.341 --> 20:09.340
What?

20:09.342 --> 20:10.508
Our patient, Mr. Neville,

20:10.510 --> 20:12.710
he has cutaneous Anthrax
all over his body.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.545
Are you... you sure?
Textbook.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.314
Painless but itchy black ulcers,
blisters.

20:16.316 --> 20:17.866
Mr. Neville had cuts
all over his body.

20:17.867 --> 20:19.018
That... that's how the
Anthrax spores got in.

20:19.042 --> 20:19.417
Oh, my god.

20:19.419 --> 20:21.886
So, the bomb wasn't...
Wasn't just meant to maim.

20:21.888 --> 20:24.855
It was a dispersal method
for Anthrax?

20:24.857 --> 20:27.625
Anybody who came in contact
could be sick.

20:27.627 --> 20:31.229
If it... if it aerosolized,
that could mean the whole E.R.

20:31.231 --> 20:32.997
We need to shut... sir!

20:32.999 --> 20:34.899
Shut down the E.R.
nobody comes in or out.

20:36.936 --> 20:38.903
Everyone, we need you
to calm down, all right?

20:38.905 --> 20:40.972
Everybody, just please...
Please calm down.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.817
Her blood pressure
and oxygen levels are back up.

20:52.819 --> 20:54.452
All right.
Let's update SWAT.

20:54.454 --> 20:56.880
I'm sure they've cleared
the hospital by now.

20:56.905 --> 20:57.905
Yeah.

21:06.633 --> 21:07.932
Hey.
What's going on?

21:07.934 --> 21:09.967
We had to shut down
the hospital. Anthrax.

21:09.969 --> 21:12.336
It was in the bomb.

21:12.338 --> 21:14.038
Probably, and since you two just
worked on the bomber...

21:14.040 --> 21:16.874
We could've breathed in spores
or gotten it from her blood.

21:16.876 --> 21:18.609
Okay, we need to decontaminate.
Right.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.194
Anyone symptomatic?

21:20.195 --> 21:21.778
Your old man.
Multiple Anthrax lesions.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.281
Limited to his skin,

21:23.283 --> 21:24.282
but we're beginning treatment
for everyone,

21:24.284 --> 21:25.750
so you two need to go right now.

21:25.752 --> 21:27.752
Everyone's under medical
observation till the morning.

21:27.754 --> 21:29.387
Anthrax could be everywhere.

21:29.389 --> 21:29.997
Anthrax?

21:30.022 --> 21:31.822
That's right. We think
it was in the bomb.

21:34.494 --> 21:36.360
How's, uh... how's Lauren?

21:36.362 --> 21:38.729
We were able to restore
blood flow to the lower leg.

21:38.731 --> 21:40.064
She's lucky we could
save it in time.

21:40.066 --> 21:41.599
Yeah, lucky.

21:41.601 --> 21:43.768
She didn't want to come in
today, but I made her.

21:43.770 --> 21:46.437
Kenny, you had no way
of knowing that. Come on.

21:46.439 --> 21:47.905
You need your antibiotics.

21:49.575 --> 21:52.076
Lauren's already on Cipro
from the operation. So...

21:52.078 --> 21:53.978
Well, now it's time for you.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.446
On my way.
Okay, good.

21:55.448 --> 21:58.015
It's all gonna be okay.
Don't worry.

21:58.017 --> 22:01.686
O-okay, worry,
but it's gonna be okay.

22:01.688 --> 22:03.721
No, don't wake up my mother.

22:05.058 --> 22:07.792
Love you, too.

22:09.062 --> 22:10.828
Oh.

22:35.088 --> 22:37.788
Just taking a breath.

22:37.790 --> 22:40.057
You deserve it.

22:40.059 --> 22:42.393
About earlier...

22:43.730 --> 22:46.897
Sorry. I was wrong.
You were right.

22:46.899 --> 22:48.999
Okay, I don't even know what
you're talking about anymore,

22:49.001 --> 22:51.969
but, uh, I'm pretty sure it
doesn't matter.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.888
If you would've listened to me

22:53.889 --> 22:55.806
and sent those patients to all
those different hospitals,

22:55.808 --> 22:58.042
we would've spread Anthrax
everywhere.

23:00.713 --> 23:04.115
That was probably the plan
in the first place, wasn't it?

23:04.117 --> 23:06.917
The plan was fear.

23:06.919 --> 23:10.154
And believe me, I fell for it.

23:10.156 --> 23:12.156
I was scared.

23:12.158 --> 23:13.557
You were?

23:13.559 --> 23:16.394
I was... I was petrified.

23:17.697 --> 23:19.830
And it... it comes with
having kids.

23:19.832 --> 23:21.899
You... you realize

23:21.901 --> 23:24.568
you have something
more important to live for.

23:26.072 --> 23:29.840
You know, everyone thinks
having a family

23:29.842 --> 23:32.710
is only exhaustion

23:32.712 --> 23:36.113
and the end of fun.

23:36.115 --> 23:41.819
But once you have kids,
you realize that...

23:41.821 --> 23:44.555
Watching their soccer game,

23:44.557 --> 23:46.791
getting a-a piece of art,

23:46.793 --> 23:49.059
or just even...

23:49.061 --> 23:54.532
Having a conversation with them,
it's... it's exciting.

23:54.534 --> 23:57.001
It's as exciting
as a blockbuster movie

23:57.003 --> 24:01.138
and four-star meal
rolled into one.

24:01.140 --> 24:03.474
All you want to do is
be around them.

24:03.476 --> 24:05.976
Sorry, I'm... I'm just...
I'm just rambling.

24:05.978 --> 24:08.579
No, you're not rambling.

24:10.082 --> 24:13.083
Brianna.

24:13.085 --> 24:15.820
Uh...

24:15.822 --> 24:17.588
I don't know.

24:17.590 --> 24:20.124
I just... I feel... Like...

24:22.562 --> 24:25.496
I can't describe how I feel.

24:25.498 --> 24:28.098
I can.
You're a good dude.

24:28.100 --> 24:32.102
You see this kid who basically
has nobody else in the world

24:32.104 --> 24:35.206
and you step right in.

24:35.208 --> 24:37.107
She's just so cool.

24:38.644 --> 24:40.945
And brave, and yet I-i know

24:40.947 --> 24:42.246
she's had nothing
but disappointment

24:42.248 --> 24:45.149
her whole life.

24:45.151 --> 24:47.485
I just feel like
I need to be there for her.

24:49.222 --> 24:51.722
I want to be there for her.

24:51.724 --> 24:54.258
Right.

24:54.260 --> 24:56.861
But I just feel like
I can't leave her side

24:56.863 --> 24:59.763
until she gets
that lung transplant.

24:59.765 --> 25:02.132
Any update on that?

25:02.134 --> 25:04.168
It's not good.

25:04.170 --> 25:06.704
Her lungs are shutting down.

25:06.706 --> 25:08.506
Carbon dioxide is climbing fast.

25:08.508 --> 25:12.243
They wanna put her on BiPAP.

25:12.245 --> 25:15.646
She is gonna need that lung
sooner rather than later.

25:17.250 --> 25:19.517
Does... does she know?

25:21.254 --> 25:22.820
Nope.

25:24.223 --> 25:26.824
I was supposed to tell her
tonight, so...

25:40.573 --> 25:42.139
line is in.

25:42.141 --> 25:43.774
Start the phenylephrine
at 10 mics per minute.

25:43.776 --> 25:46.277
Temp's still climbing up to 105.

25:46.279 --> 25:47.912
She's septic.

25:47.914 --> 25:49.947
The gram stain came back.
She has Anthrax in her blood.

25:49.949 --> 25:52.316
Septicemic Anthrax?

25:52.318 --> 25:54.785
But she's on the same big-gun
antibiotics that we are.

25:54.787 --> 25:56.287
She's a healthy young woman.

25:56.289 --> 25:57.888
Could she be immunocompromised?

25:57.890 --> 25:59.557
That would explain the pneumonia

25:59.559 --> 26:01.292
and why she's been sick
the past few weeks.

26:05.565 --> 26:07.798
I don't think that's pneumonia.

26:11.337 --> 26:15.239
See these
well-defined edges here?

26:15.241 --> 26:17.575
That's a mass.

26:24.250 --> 26:25.967
It's already fading.

26:25.968 --> 26:27.685
It looks like the antibiotics
are doing their work,

26:27.687 --> 26:29.286
and you're gonna be okay.

26:29.288 --> 26:30.854
Great.

26:30.856 --> 26:33.691
How did that happen?

26:33.693 --> 26:35.993
You don't remember
the bomb blast

26:35.995 --> 26:38.262
and the aftermath?

26:38.264 --> 26:41.265
And, "aah, it's Anthrax!"

26:41.267 --> 26:46.103
I'll be honest with you.
Uh, I'm a bit addled sometimes.

26:46.105 --> 26:49.106
We all are, Mr. Neville.
We all are.

26:49.108 --> 26:51.642
Where's your husband?

26:51.644 --> 26:54.712
He's not my husband.
He's...

26:54.714 --> 26:57.648
Paul's just a really good guy
that...

26:57.650 --> 27:01.018
Got in with the wrong girl.
Is that you?

27:02.288 --> 27:04.688
Yeah. I think it is.

27:04.690 --> 27:09.126
Look, you are so young
and so unformed.

27:09.128 --> 27:13.797
How could you possibly know that
you're the wrong girl for him?

27:13.799 --> 27:18.369
If you care about him at all,
let him make that decision.

27:18.371 --> 27:23.073
We're smarter than we look,
you know.

27:23.075 --> 27:26.310
But my balls still <i>really</i> hurt.

27:26.312 --> 27:27.978
Excuse me?

27:27.980 --> 27:29.947
My balls, they hurt like hell.

27:29.949 --> 27:32.683
That's why I'm here.

27:32.685 --> 27:36.186
Okay.
Well, let's take a look.

27:40.693 --> 27:42.292
Okay, so... whoa.

27:42.294 --> 27:43.761
Whoa.

27:45.798 --> 27:48.666
Hang on, Mr. Neville.

27:48.668 --> 27:50.300
Looks like most of
his intestines

27:50.302 --> 27:52.302
have slipped into his scrotum.

27:52.304 --> 27:54.138
An inguinal hernia, yeah.

27:54.140 --> 27:56.674
It hurts like hell.

27:56.676 --> 27:58.375
Can you fix it?

27:58.377 --> 28:01.779
Toph, hey.
I just checked on the bomber.

28:01.781 --> 28:03.814
Vitals are fine.
Cops are guarding her.

28:03.816 --> 28:05.566
Okay, I just talked to SWAT.

28:05.567 --> 28:07.317
They're gonna take her to
the jail ward with full guard.

28:07.319 --> 28:08.852
Did they get a name?

28:08.854 --> 28:10.421
Katharine Santiago.

28:10.423 --> 28:12.923
Pharmacist. Uh, lived alone.

28:12.925 --> 28:14.358
Still no motive.

28:14.360 --> 28:18.095
Wait. Topher, did you just say
Katharine Santiago?

28:18.097 --> 28:19.963
Yeah.

28:19.965 --> 28:22.733
I knew I recognized that face.

28:22.735 --> 28:25.869
She came in here about
six months ago. She was my case.

28:25.871 --> 28:27.404
Jordan, you've seen hundreds
of patients since then.

28:27.406 --> 28:29.173
Yeah, but I remember this one.

28:33.779 --> 28:35.045
Excuse me.

28:46.726 --> 28:48.959
Evening, Dr. Alexander.

28:51.464 --> 28:53.197
I thought we gave you
enough benzos

28:53.199 --> 28:55.132
to help you rest comfortably.

28:55.134 --> 28:57.434
I use it to sleep,

28:57.436 --> 28:59.837
every night at home since...

28:59.839 --> 29:03.373
Since it happened.

29:03.375 --> 29:05.109
Would you like some more?

29:05.111 --> 29:07.878
No.

29:07.880 --> 29:10.814
I'd need more than you could
give me to be comfortable.

29:12.985 --> 29:14.885
I remember you.

29:16.822 --> 29:18.522
From that night.

29:19.792 --> 29:21.992
You remember everything?

29:24.964 --> 29:26.363
Yeah.

29:28.400 --> 29:29.933
It was my last shift
before I went off

29:29.935 --> 29:33.070
to work on the reservation.
And, uh...

29:35.841 --> 29:40.110
I had just been through
something... Hard.

29:40.112 --> 29:42.346
And it was all
I could think about.

29:47.386 --> 29:49.853
But I remember you coming in.

29:51.824 --> 29:53.824
It was a hit-and-run.

29:55.261 --> 29:58.829
You came in with both
your husband

29:58.831 --> 30:01.865
and your son.

30:01.867 --> 30:03.934
Both D.O.A.

30:09.875 --> 30:12.943
You suffered significant trauma
to your chest and your spine.

30:12.945 --> 30:17.014
I got your heart going again,
and I sent you to surgery.

30:19.118 --> 30:21.051
We saved you.

30:23.155 --> 30:25.355
Yes, you did.

30:25.357 --> 30:29.526
So what I don't understand is...

30:29.528 --> 30:31.962
Why did you do this to us?

30:36.368 --> 30:40.838
When I woke up,
John and Corey were gone.

30:40.840 --> 30:42.206
And all I could think about

30:42.208 --> 30:46.376
was making the people
who ruined my life suffer.

30:47.913 --> 30:50.180
You mean
the hit-and-run driver.

30:52.084 --> 30:54.985
He's not the one who saved me.

30:54.987 --> 30:58.021
You.

30:58.023 --> 31:01.291
You were the one.

31:01.293 --> 31:04.027
You should've just let me die.

31:07.099 --> 31:08.899
I can only imagine
what you felt.

31:08.901 --> 31:11.535
You can never imagine!

31:11.537 --> 31:14.071
Losing a child?

31:14.073 --> 31:16.940
A husband?

31:16.942 --> 31:21.511
He was my best friend.

31:21.513 --> 31:25.549
I didn't want to live then
and I don't want to live now.

31:28.053 --> 31:29.953
No! No, stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

31:31.290 --> 31:32.990
Stop!
Aah!

31:35.361 --> 31:36.393
What the hell happened?

31:36.395 --> 31:38.028
She pulled out her chest tube.

31:38.998 --> 31:40.597
Get the crash cart.

31:57.316 --> 31:59.583
Calling time of death...
5:48 A.M.

32:08.627 --> 32:09.927
look at me.

32:13.132 --> 32:16.433
It's not your fault.

32:26.478 --> 32:29.546
Dr. Scott looked at the X-ray,
and, uh,

32:29.548 --> 32:31.415
he thinks he'll be able
to get rid of all of it.

32:31.417 --> 32:34.718
So with that and chemo,
you're gonna be okay.

32:37.056 --> 32:40.023
Except for
the messed up leg part, right?

32:44.596 --> 32:46.697
Look, Lauren...

32:49.635 --> 32:51.368
I'm... I'm...

32:51.370 --> 32:53.070
I'm sorry.

32:53.072 --> 32:54.671
Uh...

32:54.673 --> 32:57.641
I shouldn't have brought
you here.

32:57.643 --> 33:00.167
You know, if I didn't,
this wouldn't have...

33:00.192 --> 33:01.345
If you didn't...

33:01.347 --> 33:05.716
I'd have a tumor in my lung
and I wouldn't know it.

33:07.519 --> 33:11.355
Guess I never thought
about it like that.

33:11.357 --> 33:14.157
That's 'cause
you've been amazing.

33:14.159 --> 33:17.361
Pushing me as hard as you can
so I can get the scholarship,

33:17.363 --> 33:21.298
and... Making me the best
soccer player I could be.

33:21.300 --> 33:23.600
I-I just know how much
you want it, you know?

33:23.602 --> 33:26.570
Do you?
I do, I do.

33:26.572 --> 33:28.205
You know, when I was your age,

33:28.207 --> 33:30.741
I wanted more than anything
to be in the NFL.

33:30.743 --> 33:32.242
It was my dream
more than anything.

33:32.244 --> 33:34.511
Hey, what?

33:34.513 --> 33:37.681
Nothing. Just...

33:37.683 --> 33:40.250
You're just like my dad.

33:40.252 --> 33:42.085
Your dad?
Yes.

33:42.087 --> 33:45.288
He tells the same
stories over and over again.

33:45.290 --> 33:47.524
Like, I've heard that one
at least a hundred times.

33:49.762 --> 33:53.630
But... That's just not me.

33:53.632 --> 33:57.067
What's not you?

33:58.604 --> 34:03.640
There are a lot of things I'm
gonna miss because of my leg,

34:03.642 --> 34:07.044
but soccer isn't one of them.

34:07.046 --> 34:08.678
I hate soccer.

34:08.679 --> 34:10.580
No.

34:10.581 --> 34:11.715
Are you serious?

34:11.717 --> 34:14.251
Despise it.

34:14.253 --> 34:18.455
I've been playing 350 days
out of the year since I was 6.

34:18.456 --> 34:19.623
No weekends, no fun.

34:19.625 --> 34:22.559
Just...
Train, train, train

34:22.561 --> 34:24.460
so I can get that scholarship
and get into college.

34:24.463 --> 34:28.165
But...

34:28.167 --> 34:30.600
I don't know.
I guess that's all over now.

34:32.304 --> 34:33.737
No, it's not.

34:35.641 --> 34:38.308
Look, Lauren...

34:38.310 --> 34:41.143
Okay. Hey...

34:41.146 --> 34:42.411
You are the most positive,

34:42.414 --> 34:45.715
hard-working person
I've ever met.

34:45.717 --> 34:49.351
You're telling me that... that
if you turn that... that focus,

34:49.353 --> 34:53.223
that... that energy to your...
To your college applications,

34:53.225 --> 34:56.693
you don't think... you don't
think you'll get a scholarship?

34:56.695 --> 34:59.396
Hmm?

34:59.398 --> 35:02.365
I got a recommendation letter
in me you wouldn't believe.

35:02.367 --> 35:04.134
And sadly, you...

35:04.136 --> 35:06.536
You got your college essay
right here.

35:06.538 --> 35:09.473
Yeah.
Mm.

35:09.475 --> 35:13.710
Like, how could they turn down
a dual threat...

35:13.712 --> 35:16.580
Bomb and...
Cancer survivor?

35:18.617 --> 35:20.650
We take what god gives us.

35:22.754 --> 35:24.221
Amen.

35:24.223 --> 35:26.389
But me and you...

35:26.391 --> 35:28.892
We're gonna do this together.

35:28.894 --> 35:30.393
Okay?

35:35.834 --> 35:37.734
Okay.
Yeah?

35:39.638 --> 35:41.605
Okay.

35:44.243 --> 35:48.712
Don't be sad, drew.
It's okay.

35:48.714 --> 35:50.480
I know there's a plan for me.

35:50.482 --> 35:52.182
Yes, there is.

35:52.184 --> 35:53.450
And I'm all over it.

35:53.452 --> 35:55.185
You're on every donor list
in the country.

35:55.187 --> 35:56.786
I check 'em every day.

35:56.788 --> 35:59.523
No.

35:59.525 --> 36:02.659
What I mean is...

36:02.661 --> 36:04.261
I've always heard that
when you die,

36:04.263 --> 36:06.429
you go to a better place.

36:08.267 --> 36:11.668
Gotta say, I've been in and out
of a dozen foster homes,

36:11.670 --> 36:14.871
had cystic fibrosis and, uh,

36:14.873 --> 36:17.374
now I need a lung transplant.

36:19.545 --> 36:22.546
So if I go...

36:22.548 --> 36:25.882
It's gotta be to a better place
than this, right?

36:25.884 --> 36:29.819
I'm not gonna let that happen.

36:29.821 --> 36:32.789
I've read enough about
lung transplants, drew.

36:35.294 --> 36:37.427
They just don't happen.

36:44.970 --> 36:47.938
Could you read to me?

36:47.940 --> 36:50.407
I'm feeling a little tired.

36:50.409 --> 36:52.709
Okay, yeah. No, get some...

36:56.682 --> 36:57.881
All right, good to go.

37:01.620 --> 37:02.752
Hey, hey.

37:02.754 --> 37:04.754
Uh, Mr. Neville did great
in surgery.

37:04.756 --> 37:06.556
Uh, he's gonna be out
in a couple days.

37:06.558 --> 37:07.724
Good.

37:07.726 --> 37:10.627
Yeah. All right.

37:10.629 --> 37:12.295
So I-i know we haven't exactly
had time

37:12.297 --> 37:14.698
to talk about the elephant
in the room. Um...

37:14.700 --> 37:17.400
Oh, let's not talk about
Mr. Neville's scrotum.

37:17.402 --> 37:20.704
Uh, yeah, there's that, too.

37:20.706 --> 37:22.739
Uh...
Look, Paul.

37:22.741 --> 37:25.909
Um... I like you.

37:25.911 --> 37:29.913
I-I think you're a good guy.

37:29.915 --> 37:33.450
You might even be good for me.

37:33.452 --> 37:35.752
But I know where this is going,

37:35.754 --> 37:39.656
and it would... it would ruin
our friendship,

37:39.658 --> 37:43.426
maybe even our working
together. So...

37:43.428 --> 37:44.894
Yeah, yeah.

37:44.896 --> 37:47.864
I was actually, uh, gonna say
the same thing, you know?

37:47.866 --> 37:49.532
It's, uh, it's the right call.

37:49.534 --> 37:51.901
I mean, uh, Kenny, Krista,
Jordan, T.C.

37:51.903 --> 37:53.503
Jordan and Scott.
Yeah.

37:53.505 --> 37:55.338
I mean, uh...

37:55.340 --> 37:57.440
Yeah, it's for the best, right?

37:57.442 --> 38:00.877
So, uh, you know,
I'll see you around.

38:00.879 --> 38:03.713
Yeah. I'll see you around.

38:17.062 --> 38:19.996
"The queen let another drop fall
from her bottle onto the snow,

38:19.998 --> 38:22.332
"and instantly
there appeared a round box

38:22.334 --> 38:24.968
"tied with green silk ribbon
which, when opened,

38:24.970 --> 38:26.836
"turned out to contain
several pounds

38:26.838 --> 38:28.872
"of the best Turkish delight.

38:28.874 --> 38:31.374
"Each piece was sweet and light
to the very center,

38:31.376 --> 38:34.844
and Edmund had never tasted
anything more delicious."

39:35.040 --> 39:38.475
hey, Scott, Paul, can I have
a second, everybody?

39:39.811 --> 39:41.978
Uh, I just...

39:43.415 --> 39:49.753
I-I just... I just want to say
that I have never been so proud.

39:49.755 --> 39:51.721
We are on the front lines.

39:51.723 --> 39:55.141
This is our job,

39:55.142 --> 39:58.560
but sometimes we put ourselves
in harm's way to help others.

39:58.563 --> 40:00.964
We make a difference.

40:00.966 --> 40:03.800
So it's not about getting
knocked down.

40:03.802 --> 40:05.034
It's about getting back up,

40:05.036 --> 40:08.037
but we will get back up
because of you.

40:09.174 --> 40:12.876
Dr. Zia.

40:21.019 --> 40:22.719
Hey.

40:22.721 --> 40:25.021
Hey.

40:25.023 --> 40:27.090
You okay?

40:27.092 --> 40:28.691
Yeah.

40:28.693 --> 40:31.194
You know, bomb, Anthrax,

40:31.196 --> 40:32.662
former patient trying
to kill us.

40:32.664 --> 40:34.431
Why wouldn't I be?
Yeah.

40:34.433 --> 40:37.167
If you need anything,
I'll be here.

40:37.169 --> 40:38.902
Thank you.
Yeah.

40:42.007 --> 40:43.640
Hey, Jess.

40:43.642 --> 40:46.476
Um...

40:46.478 --> 40:49.012
Everything's clear.

40:49.014 --> 40:51.047
Wait, you... you're kidding me.

40:51.049 --> 40:52.949
Thanks... thanks for letting me know.

40:52.951 --> 40:55.485
Hey, guys. It was the union.
We got our raise.

40:55.487 --> 40:56.619
The strike's over.

40:56.621 --> 40:58.087
Oh.
Yes!

41:02.727 --> 41:05.829
It's about time we got some
good news, right?

41:05.831 --> 41:08.064
That's debatable.

41:08.066 --> 41:10.567
What are you talking about?

41:10.569 --> 41:14.804
That was just the...
The head of day shift.

41:14.806 --> 41:17.941
The reason that
the nurses' negotiations

41:17.943 --> 41:20.510
took so long with management?

41:20.512 --> 41:25.615
The hospital is... is being sold
to an insurance company.

41:25.617 --> 41:27.851
What?

41:27.853 --> 41:31.754
And... and the company wants
to sell off the E.R.
