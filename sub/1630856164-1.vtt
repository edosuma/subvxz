to talk about.

00:09.634 --> 00:11.469

-ARTIE: It's a little setback,
all right?

00:11.553 --> 00:14.139
-I can make it all right.
-MELANIE: A little setback?

00:14.180 --> 00:16.641
Are-are you kidding me?
You've ruined our lives.

00:16.683 --> 00:18.518

01:09.569 --> 01:12.280
Fucking Saints, am I right?

01:12.364 --> 01:14.032
-Yes, you are.
-I mean, you're gonna

01:14.074 --> 01:17.535
cover the spread. Just pull
your panties out of your ass and

01:17.577 --> 01:20.372

-Okay, what do you like?

01:20.413 --> 01:23.792

K.C. minus six and a half.

And the Jags plus
three and a half.

All right, you lose,

01:48.858 --> 01:50.652
I'm gonna need
to see you next week.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.072
Yeah. You don't like the play?

01:54.155 --> 01:55.740
Who cares what I like?

01:55.782 --> 01:58.368
It's just hard to get

-I just gave you three grand.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.811

-Why you doing that?

02:24.894 --> 02:26.271

It's an upscale gift shop

09:31.279 --> 09:33.740
(doorbell buzzes)

09:33.823 --> 09:35.700
-DANNY (over monitor): Hi.
-Hey.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.494
You want to buzz us in,
Lorraine?

09:37.535 --> 09:39.537
What's the secret password?

09:39.579 --> 09:41.206
Not now, Lorraine.

09:41.289 --> 09:42.957
(door buzzes)

09:42.999 --> 09:45.710
All right.

09:49.297 --> 09:51.007
-Hey.
-Hey.

09:51.049 --> 09:53.051
Jesus, what happened to you?

09:53.093 --> 09:56.346
Your brother learned about
gender sensitivity. (grunts)

09:57.305 --> 09:59.641
Here's the calls for today.
How's the online action?

09:59.724 --> 10:01.726
Busy. Thursday night's game
is all K.C.

10:01.810 --> 10:03.770
All right, move the line a half
and, uh...

10:03.853 --> 10:04.896
we're writing off
the Malenkovich debt.

10:04.979 --> 10:06.898
What? That's a big number, D.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.651
-Just write it off.
-Well, did you at least
let Ray wind him up?

10:09.734 --> 10:11.069
I'm mostly a visual deterrent.

10:11.152 --> 10:13.405
Listen, the days
of breaking legs are over, okay?

10:13.446 --> 10:16.533
-I'm not gonna do anything that
puts the cops on my ass.
-You're such a puss.

10:16.574 --> 10:17.867
A puss that doesn't need

10:17.909 --> 10:19.244
to join the Aryan Nation
to take a shower.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.579
Listen, let me just
make a phone call.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.039
No, that's not how
I do business.

10:23.081 --> 10:24.582
What kind of business allows
a guy to walk

10:24.624 --> 10:25.959
-on six grand?
-DANNY: Eight grand.

10:26.042 --> 10:27.836
Every business.
It's called shrinkage.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.797
Listen, all retail operators
factor in

10:30.880 --> 10:31.923
losses due to shoplifting,

10:32.007 --> 10:34.050
bad checks, what have you.

10:34.092 --> 10:35.427
It's called shrinkage,
look it up.

10:35.468 --> 10:36.469
I'll tell you what's shrinking.

10:36.553 --> 10:37.846
Don't.

10:37.929 --> 10:39.139
We're all thinking it,
that's enough.

10:39.222 --> 10:41.641
Fuck you both.
Just write it off.

10:41.725 --> 10:44.060
Fine. Oh, I do have
some good news.

10:44.102 --> 10:44.853
Tell me.

10:44.936 --> 10:45.979
I found Charlie Sheen.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.522
-DANNY: Really?
-Yes.

10:47.605 --> 10:49.441
-Where is that fuckwad?
-LORRAINE: In Malibu.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.443
A rehab called
Freedom from Bondage House.

10:51.526 --> 10:54.404
-How'd you find him?
-TMZ. Paparazzi
got a picture of him

10:54.446 --> 10:56.740
-walking in the back door.
-Let's roll.

10:56.781 --> 10:58.283
Just got to make a quick stop.

10:58.324 --> 10:59.743
I'm not waiting in the car
while you get laid.

10:59.784 --> 11:01.786
You're welcome.

11:09.461 --> 11:12.714
Yo, it's me. I got two pounds
ready to go.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.341
No, I'm not selling
on consignment.

11:14.424 --> 11:16.134
You pay for it up front,
or grow your own shrooms.

11:16.217 --> 11:19.512
Train Town, Griffith Park,
one hour, bring cash.

11:19.596 --> 11:21.139
No, you can't Venmo me.

11:21.222 --> 11:23.600
I'm not cutting
your fucking hair.

(sighs) You know,
I hope she appreciates

11:43.078 --> 11:45.330
-what a wonderful
grandson you are.
-She doesn't.

11:46.456 --> 11:48.165
Yo, what you need that for?

11:48.249 --> 11:50.335
No offense, but are we
or are we not in the hood?

11:50.418 --> 11:51.795
Excuse me?

11:51.836 --> 11:54.172
But "hood" is short
for "neighborhood,"

11:54.214 --> 11:56.091
with an emphasis on "neighbor."

11:56.174 --> 11:59.177
What do you want from me, Ray?
I'm scared.

Yo, NFL.

12:12.816 --> 12:14.693

12:14.776 --> 12:16.403
You keep talking, and you won't.

12:16.486 --> 12:17.987
Look here,

12:18.029 --> 12:20.198

12:23.076 --> 12:25.161
See, Danny,
these are good kids, man.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.460
Yeah.

12:32.544 --> 12:34.212
They're the future.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.296
(sighs)

12:35.380 --> 12:38.717
Uh-huh. (laughs)
What you think, Grandma?

12:38.758 --> 12:40.677
50 inches,

12:40.719 --> 12:42.637
beautiful picture.

12:42.721 --> 12:44.514
Is it hot?

12:44.556 --> 12:46.224
No.

12:46.307 --> 12:49.477
I don't care about no TV.
I want my house back.

12:49.519 --> 12:50.854
Can we please not do this now?

12:50.895 --> 12:54.315
See this? I used to live here.

12:54.399 --> 12:56.609
It's in a cul-de-sac
in Brentwood.

12:56.693 --> 12:57.902
That's a nice part of town.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.904
I lived next door
to Judd Apatow.

12:59.988 --> 13:02.240
Now look at me.

13:02.323 --> 13:06.077
I live next door
to an oil derrick.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.246
I'm doing the best I can.

13:08.329 --> 13:09.873
I want to go back to Brentwood.

13:09.914 --> 13:11.624
RAY: And I want
to get you back there,

13:11.708 --> 13:13.960
but I don't play football
anymore, and I can't afford it.

13:14.044 --> 13:16.880
You could play in Canada.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.590
I broke my leg
in three different places.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.842
They had to airlift me
off the fucking field.

13:20.925 --> 13:23.428
Watch your fucking mouth.

13:23.511 --> 13:25.805
Just... I just need
a little time.

13:25.889 --> 13:28.016
I'm paying child support
to Brook,

13:28.099 --> 13:29.976
to Janelle, to Sharise.

13:30.060 --> 13:31.770
I'm doing everything I can.

13:31.853 --> 13:33.563
Everything but a vasectomy.

13:33.605 --> 13:35.231
(laughs)

13:35.273 --> 13:37.442
What you laughing at,
Mr. Mafioso?

13:37.484 --> 13:39.110
Oh, I'm not mafioso.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.946
That's right. Mafiosos
pay off their grandma's house.

13:41.988 --> 13:44.366
They take care of the people
who raised them.

13:44.449 --> 13:47.827
I will not rest until I get you
back into a beautiful home.

13:47.911 --> 13:49.954
Good.

13:52.374 --> 13:55.377
Hmm. Does this thing have HBO?

13:55.460 --> 13:57.212
Just basic cable.

13:57.295 --> 14:01.257
How am I supposed to see
all that dragon shit?

14:04.469 --> 14:05.512
I'll get on it.

14:05.595 --> 14:08.640
See that you do. And you...

14:10.016 --> 14:11.476
You look awful.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.228
I know.

14:14.688 --> 14:17.357
-(laughs)
-What?

14:17.440 --> 14:20.151
"The dragon shit."

14:21.820 --> 14:23.822
What the fuck?

14:23.905 --> 14:26.491
Yo, what happened to our car?

14:26.574 --> 14:27.992
Got repoed, man.

14:28.076 --> 14:30.495
But I was watching.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.205
Repoed?

14:32.288 --> 14:34.708
Didn't you take that car
in a trade?

14:34.790 --> 14:37.293
Yeah, the Blue Book
was twice what he owed us.

14:37.335 --> 14:39.170
Oh, man.

14:40.463 --> 14:42.841
-I guess we're taking your car.
-I can't.

14:42.924 --> 14:45.051
Grandma needs it
to go to water aerobics.

14:45.135 --> 14:47.220
Are you kidding me?
Does she have to?

14:47.303 --> 14:49.055
Do you want to go back in there

14:49.139 --> 14:51.933
and tell her she can't go?

14:54.811 --> 14:55.895
What you doing?

14:55.979 --> 14:57.689
Uber. We got to get to Malibu.

14:57.731 --> 14:59.691
No, take a Lyft.
Got a gift card.

14:59.774 --> 15:02.986
Really? Who gives you
a gift card for Lyft?

15:03.028 --> 15:05.530
-You did, Danny.
-Oh.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.574

The absence of Jesus is hate.

are you driving a Lyft for?

16:37.288 --> 16:38.790
Maybe you didn't notice.

18:25.271 --> 18:26.731

of every month.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.557
-How much do you make an hour?
-What?

19:00.598 --> 19:02.976
How much do you make? Ten, 12?

19:03.059 --> 19:04.102
Fifteen.

19:04.144 --> 19:06.062

Have some compassion.

20:12.587 --> 20:14.464
That's a beautiful view.

20:16.174 --> 20:17.926
What is that, Catalina?

20:18.009 --> 20:21.721
-That's got to help.
-(continues crying)

20:24.224 --> 20:26.685
Okay, think good thoughts.

20:27.852 --> 20:30.146
Eugene, it's on you.

20:30.188 --> 20:31.940
Fifty.

20:32.023 --> 20:33.525
(sighs)

20:33.608 --> 20:34.484
Call.

20:34.526 --> 20:37.487
-Angus?
-And... 50.

20:37.529 --> 20:38.697
Oh, someone's feeling lucky.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.198
I don't need luck to beat you.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.950
(laughter)

20:42.033 --> 20:43.493
What happened to this kid?

20:43.535 --> 20:45.036
He used to be so cute.

20:45.078 --> 20:46.371
He gruesome.

20:46.413 --> 20:48.206
(laughter)

20:48.289 --> 20:50.709
Hey, there's my guy.

20:50.792 --> 20:53.753
Oh, shit. Danny.

20:53.837 --> 20:55.380
Ray.

20:55.463 --> 20:56.589
Jesus, what happened to you?

20:56.673 --> 20:59.217
Little scuffle. No big deal.

20:59.300 --> 21:01.094
You should see the other girl.

21:01.970 --> 21:04.723
So, what-what-what-what
brings you here?

21:04.806 --> 21:08.101
What kind of question is that?
We were concerned about you.

21:08.184 --> 21:10.854
Oh, you thought that...
(laughs) No, no, no, no, I am,

21:10.895 --> 21:13.857
I'm clean as a whistle.
I just run a game here.

21:15.066 --> 21:16.526
In a rehab?

21:16.568 --> 21:19.529
Yeah. There's no guns,
the food is terrific,

21:19.571 --> 21:22.532
and there's ample parking.

21:23.908 --> 21:25.368
Could we talk to you
for a minute?

21:25.410 --> 21:27.412
Of course.

21:27.495 --> 21:29.414
Deal me out.

21:34.044 --> 21:35.712
How'd you find this place?

21:35.754 --> 21:37.589
Oh, I've gotten sober here
many times.

21:37.672 --> 21:39.883
It's a wonderful program.
The owner's a buddy.

21:39.924 --> 21:42.302
-He lets me rent the room.
-Nice.

21:42.385 --> 21:43.762
So, what's it cost
to get the cure here?

21:43.803 --> 21:46.097
Last time I got a nudge
from the judge?

21:46.139 --> 21:47.932
-About 75 grand a month.
-(scoffs)

21:48.016 --> 21:49.517
I'm in the wrong business.

21:49.601 --> 21:52.228
You know, that's not too far off
how much you owe us.

21:52.270 --> 21:55.357
Really?
'Cause I-I-I had it lower.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.275
You had it wrong.

21:57.317 --> 21:58.610
(scoffs) Come on.

21:58.693 --> 22:00.862
You know me,
I'm always good for it.

22:00.945 --> 22:02.238
Are you?

22:02.280 --> 22:03.615
'Cause I seem to recall

22:03.656 --> 22:05.617
having to push
your Maybach off a cliff.

22:05.658 --> 22:07.118
You didn't push shit.

22:07.160 --> 22:08.578
Ray pushed it.

22:08.620 --> 22:10.288
It was an S-Class.

22:10.372 --> 22:11.623
Who cares? I swear,

22:11.706 --> 22:12.999
you will get your money.

22:13.083 --> 22:15.502
I am, I am this close
to being a judge

22:15.585 --> 22:16.961
on Japan's Got Talent.

22:17.045 --> 22:19.172
Oh, terrific.
What kind of watch is that?

22:19.255 --> 22:21.174
This? Oh, this-this is...

22:21.257 --> 22:22.967
a cheap knockoff.
Garbage.

22:23.009 --> 22:25.303
-Let me see it.
-(scoffs) Danny, come on.

22:25.345 --> 22:26.680
-It's-it's junk.
-Ray?

22:26.763 --> 22:28.431
All right, whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:28.473 --> 22:30.433
Slow down. Take it easy.

22:30.475 --> 22:33.561
Look at me, visually deterring.

22:35.855 --> 22:36.690
Richard "Milly"?

22:36.773 --> 22:38.817
Ah, it's actually Richard Mille.

22:38.900 --> 22:41.653
Richard Mille.

22:41.736 --> 22:43.988
That's a douche way to say it.

22:44.072 --> 22:45.365
Google this, please.

22:45.448 --> 22:46.825
Wi-Fi password?

22:46.866 --> 22:49.077
-"Serenity."
-Of course it is.

22:49.160 --> 22:52.622
It's, uh, M-I-L-L-E.

22:54.666 --> 22:57.085
You talk to that Jon Cryer much?

22:57.168 --> 22:58.962
Not for a long time, no.

22:59.004 --> 23:00.547
He was a hoot.

23:02.173 --> 23:03.466
He's my favorite.

23:03.508 --> 23:06.177
It was really more
an ensemble show.

23:06.219 --> 23:07.846
RAY:
Son of a bitch.

23:07.929 --> 23:08.805
What?

23:08.847 --> 23:12.017
That thing is 150 grand, used.

23:12.058 --> 23:14.686
Charlie, I thought
we were friends.

23:14.769 --> 23:17.230
We are friends,
but I only owe you 75.

23:17.313 --> 23:20.025
-Charlie, Charlie, Charlie...
-Okay, okay, hold on, hold on.

23:20.066 --> 23:23.028
What if I make this right
with some baseball memorabilia?

23:23.069 --> 23:24.863
Guys, guys,

23:24.946 --> 23:28.575
I've got Babe Ruth's
autopsy report.

23:28.658 --> 23:30.410
-Stop.
-Okay.

23:30.493 --> 23:32.579
Okay, uh, uh, how about the hat

23:32.662 --> 23:35.540
Barry Bonds wore when he had
a regular-sized head?

23:37.083 --> 23:38.209
Are you done?

23:38.293 --> 23:40.211
Yeah.

23:40.253 --> 23:42.213
Listen.

23:42.297 --> 23:44.341
I like you.

23:44.382 --> 23:45.800
I really do.

23:45.884 --> 23:48.178
And I admire how you turned
your life around.

23:48.219 --> 23:50.847
Well, thank you, thank you.
I have been working very hard,

23:50.889 --> 23:52.557
you know.
I-It's all about the journey.

23:52.599 --> 23:55.060
Whoa, whoa, whoa, enough.

23:56.728 --> 23:58.229
I'm gonna tell you something

23:58.313 --> 24:00.523
I never told a client ever.

24:01.399 --> 24:02.734
I'm listening.

24:02.776 --> 24:05.236
You shouldn't bet on sports.

24:05.320 --> 24:07.155
You shouldn't bet on anything.

24:07.238 --> 24:11.409
I mean, if someone's
giving you odds that Wednesday

24:11.451 --> 24:14.746
follows Tuesday, you say,
"Nah, I'm good."

24:14.788 --> 24:18.708
But, Danny, it's all I got left.

24:18.750 --> 24:22.587
I understand, but nevertheless,
for a guy like you,

24:22.671 --> 24:24.923
no bueno.

24:24.964 --> 24:27.425
Okay. I hear you.

24:27.509 --> 24:29.719
I appreciate
your concern, and...

24:29.761 --> 24:31.054
I'm gonna take it to heart.

24:31.096 --> 24:33.098
Good.

24:33.139 --> 24:34.933
Let's go.

24:42.607 --> 24:44.734
Hey. What was that all about?

24:44.776 --> 24:46.945
I need a new bookie.

24:50.156 --> 24:52.951
(laughter)

24:54.661 --> 24:55.954
What am I missing?

24:56.037 --> 24:58.790
Thing tells time,
whoop-dee-fucking-doo.

24:58.832 --> 25:00.500
If you don't like it,
let me wear it.

25:00.583 --> 25:01.751
No.

25:01.793 --> 25:03.628
(laughs) Hey, buddy.

25:03.712 --> 25:05.755
We need another pitcher
of the margaritas.

25:05.797 --> 25:07.215
With Don Julio?

25:07.298 --> 25:09.259
We'll take the cheap shit
on the second pass.

25:09.300 --> 25:10.677
-(laughter)
-You got it.

25:12.095 --> 25:13.471
DANNY:
So,

25:13.513 --> 25:14.764
here's what I don't understand.

25:14.806 --> 25:16.433
Pot's off the table,

25:16.474 --> 25:20.061
why don't you switch to selling
other drugs, you know?

25:20.145 --> 25:23.023
Like crystal meth.
Kids still like that, right?

25:23.106 --> 25:24.816
(laughs)

25:24.858 --> 25:26.317
You seen what crystal meth
does to people's teeth?

25:26.401 --> 25:27.819
I got a brother who's a dentist.

25:27.861 --> 25:30.113
He showed me pictures.
Can't be a part of that.

25:30.155 --> 25:31.322
DANNY:
Oh.

25:31.406 --> 25:33.116
RAY:
That's... that's noble.

25:33.158 --> 25:35.452
I don't know about noble, but
at least I can sleep at night.

25:35.493 --> 25:37.412
After I smoke a bowl,
rub one out.

25:37.495 --> 25:39.956
(laughter)

25:41.666 --> 25:44.210
Oh, I got to do a toast.

25:44.294 --> 25:45.837
To a shitty day

25:45.879 --> 25:48.006
that turned into
a really great day.

25:48.048 --> 25:50.550
-Hear, hear. Ah.
-Salud. Salud.

25:50.633 --> 25:52.177
DANNY: You mind if I sit
in the front seat?

25:52.218 --> 25:53.595
Be my guest.

25:53.678 --> 25:54.846
Not that I didn't enjoy
our inadvertent

25:54.929 --> 25:56.431
dry hump in the back.

25:56.514 --> 25:57.849
RAY (laughs): Hey,
just get your ass in the car.

25:57.891 --> 25:59.142
Give me the watch.

26:00.226 --> 26:01.811
Oh, fuck.

26:01.853 --> 26:03.355
Come on, give me
the fucking watch.

26:03.396 --> 26:05.148
And if I don't,
are you really gonna shoot me?

26:05.190 --> 26:06.858
RAY: It's not worth it, Danny.
Just give him the watch.

26:06.941 --> 26:08.234
But what about our bad day
turning into a good day?

26:08.318 --> 26:10.195
Don't make me
fucking kill you, man.

26:10.278 --> 26:11.363
Shit.

26:11.446 --> 26:13.281
-(sighs)
-What're you doing, Ray?

26:13.365 --> 26:14.366
Yeah, what're you doing?

26:14.449 --> 26:15.658
Protecting the quarterback.

26:15.700 --> 26:16.785
-What?
-Throw the ball, Danny.

26:16.868 --> 26:19.704
-What?
-Throw the ball.

26:19.746 --> 26:21.039
DANNY:
Oh.

26:25.543 --> 26:27.545
Anything?

26:27.587 --> 26:29.547
You hit him once.

26:29.589 --> 26:30.840
Oh, Jesus.

26:30.882 --> 26:32.258
We got to get out of here.
