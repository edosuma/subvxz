00:07.006 --> 00:12.679
It is indeed the very rare
and unusual Ogier

00:12.762 --> 00:17.100
who will decide to leave
their Stedding homes.

00:20.521 --> 00:25.525
In the years that followed the Breaking,
during the Long Exile,

00:25.609 --> 00:29.821
we Ogier wandered lost
in search of our Steddings.

00:32.908 --> 00:38.079
It was then that Ogier began
to succumb to the Longing...

00:38.872 --> 00:41.250
to the point of death.

00:43.710 --> 00:47.465
Even after finding our Steddings
once again,

00:47.548 --> 00:51.594
we Ogier continue to be bound
to our homes.

01:00.268 --> 01:05.441
There is no lovelier place
than an Ogier Grove.

01:08.027 --> 01:10.153
With its great trees,

01:10.236 --> 01:14.700
some stand towering
since the Age of Legends.

01:17.912 --> 01:21.039
No Shadowspawn will enter.

01:21.123 --> 01:25.210
There is no way to channel the One Power.

01:25.585 --> 01:28.923
In the Stedding, there is rest.

01:31.424 --> 01:35.638
While humankind has long prized
Ogier masonry,

01:35.721 --> 01:40.141
from Illian, Tear to the great Tar Valon,

01:40.225 --> 01:42.353
it is not the true thing.

01:44.146 --> 01:47.817
For us, it has always been the forest.

01:49.819 --> 01:52.862
You cannot bring stone to life.

02:05.876 --> 02:08.169
When we sing to the forest,

02:08.253 --> 02:12.967
it is much as if the earth itself
sings to us.

02:15.844 --> 02:18.222
As a young Ogier,

02:18.305 --> 02:21.975
I had few prized possessions,

02:22.058 --> 02:25.478
of which, beyond my books,
I have not many.

02:27.272 --> 02:32.569
And whilst there is nothing better
than to be at home in the Steddings,

02:32.652 --> 02:36.781
surrounded by the comforts,
which offer wisdom and peace,

02:37.031 --> 02:40.536
with our beloved groves in sight...

02:42.829 --> 02:46.500
true adventure calls.

02:46.584 --> 02:51.881
Adventure that cannot be found in a book.

02:51.963 --> 02:56.801
Adventure that may, in fact,
risk the Longing.
