but I don't think he can handle
anything from another dimension,

20:16.082 --> 20:18.216

20:18.218 --> 20:20.518

goes to the Boogeyman's house,

25:24.991 --> 25:26.524
and it needs to be perfect.

25:26.526 --> 25:29.360
SHELBY: Let me just try to see
if I can lift it off.

25:29.362 --> 25:32.029
Oh, my gosh,
I freaking broke it.

25:32.031 --> 25:33.230
Holy crap.

25:33.232 --> 25:34.365
KIMBERLY: This is a disaster.

25:34.367 --> 25:35.799
We can't afford to waste
any more time

25:35.801 --> 25:37.134
to make a new headboard.

25:37.136 --> 25:38.569
Oh, my gosh.

25:40.773 --> 25:42.606
SHELBY: Oh, my gosh,
I freaking broke it.

25:42.608 --> 25:43.741
KIMBERLY:
Shelby has this headboard

25:43.743 --> 25:45.142
for the Boogeyman's bed,

25:45.144 --> 25:46.977
and it's cracked into
a bunch of pieces.

25:46.979 --> 25:48.979
SHELBY: This has totally
ruined everything.

25:48.981 --> 25:50.681
You're a professional.
You can make a new one.

25:50.683 --> 25:52.650
Make a new one.
You make a new one.

25:52.652 --> 25:53.884
You gonna have
to pull it out.

25:53.886 --> 25:55.252
That's what you gonna
have to do, Shelby.

25:55.254 --> 25:56.787
Shelby has a bunch
of other things to do.

25:56.789 --> 25:59.290
She has to do the toys.
She still has to do the doll.

25:59.292 --> 26:01.292
So, hopefully,
she can pull this off.

26:01.294 --> 26:03.294
SHELBY: This was, like,
the biggest part of our bed.

26:03.296 --> 26:05.029
I don't know if I can
make another one.

26:05.031 --> 26:06.497
I'm going to try.

26:06.499 --> 26:07.565
You guys, I'm working on
the en glaze base

26:07.567 --> 26:08.966
for my apple mousse.

26:08.968 --> 26:10.734
Cesar's in charge of making
our tasting element.

26:10.736 --> 26:13.170
It's gonna be a rotten apple
that's fallen from the tree.

26:13.172 --> 26:15.773
It'll be made with a green sugar
shell, with apple mousse,

26:15.775 --> 26:17.942
caramel apples,
and roasted peanut cake.

26:17.944 --> 26:19.510
CESAR: So I got the apple mousse
in here already.

26:19.512 --> 26:21.078
I'm filling it in
with the caramel apple.

26:21.080 --> 26:23.380
How long before you can
move him to the stand, Sabrina?

26:23.382 --> 26:24.582
I'd guesstimate 30.

26:24.584 --> 26:25.983
Guess what, you've got
20 minutes.

26:25.985 --> 26:28.252
The body is made from cake,
and it's looking good,

26:28.254 --> 26:30.054
but we still have to put him
up on the platform

26:30.056 --> 26:31.555
and put the pumpkin head on.

26:31.557 --> 26:33.424
I'm still pretty concerned about
the size if that pumpkin head.

26:33.426 --> 26:35.559
If it's too heavy, that whole
thing is coming down.

26:35.561 --> 26:37.294
Two hours left.

26:37.296 --> 26:38.395
Two hours?

26:38.397 --> 26:39.930
-Okay, you got it?
-Yep.

26:39.932 --> 26:41.098
ELIZABETH: In our piece,

26:41.100 --> 26:43.000
we're gonna
have this alien bounty hunter

26:43.002 --> 26:44.168
hanging over the Boogeyman.

26:44.170 --> 26:45.903
I put a good amount of cherry,

26:45.905 --> 26:47.871
so we got a good
brain color here.

26:47.873 --> 26:50.441
Because he's harvesting pieces
of these monsters,

26:50.443 --> 26:51.609
Jewel thought
it'd be really cool

26:51.611 --> 26:53.510
to have something like a brain

26:53.512 --> 26:55.846
that is harvested from
one of the creatures,

26:55.848 --> 26:57.548
and that's gonna be
a cherry panna cotta,

26:57.550 --> 26:59.216
served on a classic cookie.

26:59.218 --> 27:00.618
JEWEL: We need to motor.

27:00.620 --> 27:03.287
If I go any faster,
I'm gonna cut a finger off.

27:03.289 --> 27:05.289
I'm gonna go ahead and start
pouring the white chocolate in,

27:05.291 --> 27:07.625
to make the shells
for the tasting element.
Oh, nice.

27:07.627 --> 27:09.793
Joshua is doing
our tasting element.

27:09.795 --> 27:11.795
He's making white
chocolate bonbons

27:11.797 --> 27:13.497
with matcha tea ganache inside.

27:13.499 --> 27:15.432
JOSHUA: It's supposed to taste
like green tea.

27:15.434 --> 27:18.502
CORINNA: We're actually gonna
hide it on the monster itself.

27:18.504 --> 27:21.939
We're gonna have horns
that are actually edible.

27:21.941 --> 27:23.507
-Look at that.
-Nice.

27:23.509 --> 27:26.110
Careful.
All right,
careful with it, I've got to --

27:26.112 --> 27:28.412
Oh, this is the wrong
side, hang on.

27:28.414 --> 27:30.180
This tentacle needs
to come forward.

27:30.182 --> 27:32.549
The idea for our story
is that the Boogeyman

27:32.551 --> 27:33.951
goes to scare a little boy,

27:33.953 --> 27:36.587
but instead, he finds
the monster under the bed.

27:36.589 --> 27:39.356
Is it on?
It's on my fingers.
Ow.

27:39.358 --> 27:41.191
-All right. Good job.
-Oh, my god.

27:41.193 --> 27:42.660
Do you want to have
the butt on there,

27:42.662 --> 27:44.461
so you can fade it into it?

27:44.463 --> 27:45.863
Arlen and I have
to work together

27:45.865 --> 27:48.565
to make sure the spider's
pumpkin bottom

27:48.567 --> 27:51.068
and the cake body fit
together seamlessly.

27:51.070 --> 27:52.269
Hey, guys.

27:52.271 --> 27:54.138
I've never done this before,
but look at it.

27:54.140 --> 27:55.506
-Whoo.
-It's burning.

27:55.508 --> 27:57.274
-Whoo.
-Whoo-hoo.

27:57.276 --> 27:59.143
The cheese is melting
and everything.

27:59.145 --> 28:01.912
Orly is going to add
the mess to the room,

28:01.914 --> 28:05.783
the video game controller,
the pulled flames, some crumbs.

28:05.785 --> 28:08.919
Okay, I'm coming with the pizza,
you guys. Where the pizza go?

28:08.921 --> 28:11.388
-Can it go on top of the bed?
-Yep, yep.

28:11.390 --> 28:12.990
I need three hands 'cause
this could actually

28:12.992 --> 28:14.725
turn into a disaster.

28:14.727 --> 28:17.227
Lenny and Shelby are now
putting on the new headboard,

28:17.229 --> 28:19.963
and Shelby did an awesome job
on that second headboard.

28:19.965 --> 28:22.833
SHELBY: So I'm just bringing
out the color.

28:22.835 --> 28:25.302
It takes like -- [ blows air ].

28:25.304 --> 28:28.872
Oh.

28:28.874 --> 28:30.207
That was scary.

28:30.209 --> 28:32.242
Shelby has a lot
of stuff going on.

28:32.244 --> 28:34.778
She's making the picture
frame out of sugar.

28:34.780 --> 28:36.413
She's making a sugar doll.

28:36.415 --> 28:39.383
She's making little toys
that the boogeyman has collected

28:39.385 --> 28:41.618
from all the kids that
he's been scaring forever.

28:41.620 --> 28:43.520
How are we looking
on toys, Shelby?

28:43.522 --> 28:45.155
Good.

28:45.157 --> 28:46.890
I'm saying toys, and I'm still
working on this stupid mouse.

28:46.892 --> 28:48.025
Oh, you know what?

28:48.027 --> 28:49.560
We haven't even attached
the door, yet.

28:49.562 --> 28:51.061
I'm more worried
about that body.

28:51.063 --> 28:52.696
I'm not gonna have time
to get fondant on it.

28:52.698 --> 28:54.832
This snake is supposed
to slither

28:54.834 --> 28:57.835
out of the closest door
around the boogeyman.

28:57.837 --> 28:59.503
Okay, I want you to stop.
Go do something over there.

28:59.505 --> 29:00.738
-No, I've got it.
-No, no, no.

29:00.740 --> 29:02.072
-We need you --
-I've got it.

29:02.074 --> 29:03.474
Mm, okay.

29:03.476 --> 29:06.376
Help. Sugar. Help, help.
Sugar, sugar.

29:06.378 --> 29:08.479
This is really starting to
look just thrown together,

29:08.481 --> 29:10.614
so I'm painting pastillage.

29:10.616 --> 29:13.217
I'm laying fondant,
which I've never done before.

29:13.219 --> 29:14.885
It's a lot on my shoulders.

29:14.887 --> 29:17.855
-Is that staying?
-I guess for now.

29:17.857 --> 29:20.390
-Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
-He swiveled a lot.

29:20.392 --> 29:23.627
We get him up on the platform,
and he starts falling forward.

29:23.629 --> 29:25.496
All right, I'm gonna put it
on now, guys.

29:25.498 --> 29:27.464
That backboard might snap.

29:27.466 --> 29:29.166
This is, like,
the moment of truth here.

29:29.168 --> 29:30.467
I'm so scared right now.

29:30.469 --> 29:31.735
It's leaning a lot.

29:31.737 --> 29:32.736
I don't know if it's gonna
survive the night.

29:32.738 --> 29:34.605
It's not gonna happen.

29:34.607 --> 29:36.406
It's not happening.

29:36.408 --> 29:38.642
His head's not working.

29:40.913 --> 29:42.379
-It's not happening.
-His head's not working.

29:42.381 --> 29:45.115
Our idea is that an evil monster
goes in the boogeyman's house,

29:45.117 --> 29:46.850
and he's gonna
drop him into a portal.

29:46.852 --> 29:48.852
But if this giant pumpkin
makes this whole display

29:48.854 --> 29:51.054
crash to the ground,
we're all going home.

29:51.056 --> 29:52.089
What's plan B?

29:52.091 --> 29:54.258
Either you carve
a smaller pumpkin...

29:54.260 --> 29:55.292
Carve a smaller pumpkin?

29:55.294 --> 29:56.760
He's not gonna
have sugar eyes.

29:56.762 --> 29:59.229
So what we decided to do
is actually just have this head

29:59.231 --> 30:01.932
right on the ground and make
the whole body decapitated.

30:01.934 --> 30:04.201
Wrap this is red.
That's his head fell off.

30:04.203 --> 30:07.738
He's summoning the portal
from here.

30:07.740 --> 30:09.039
His eyes light up blue.

30:09.041 --> 30:10.874
I'm feeling pretty nervous.

30:10.876 --> 30:12.109
Just do whatever
you've got to do.

30:12.111 --> 30:13.477
15 minutes left.

30:13.479 --> 30:15.379
We've got way more
to do on this.

30:15.381 --> 30:16.446
All right. Watch out.

30:16.448 --> 30:18.182
This piece is gigantic.

30:18.184 --> 30:20.884
It is way bigger than I was
actually expecting it to be.

30:20.886 --> 30:22.686
There.
Just got to be perfect.

30:22.688 --> 30:24.855
I hate this last minute stress.

30:24.857 --> 30:26.056
Don't. Don't.

30:26.058 --> 30:27.958
Just go over and then
we'll make it work, okay?

30:27.960 --> 30:29.293
I just need this to look,
like, torn.

30:29.295 --> 30:31.595
Where are we gonna
stick the bolts down?

30:31.597 --> 30:33.397
CYNTHIA: We're running out of
time, for real.

30:33.399 --> 30:34.698
Arachnia is perfect.

30:34.700 --> 30:37.000
She is gorgeous but creepy.

30:37.002 --> 30:39.236
Boogey looks fantastic.

30:39.238 --> 30:40.904
Everything looks perfect.

30:40.906 --> 30:42.306
Five minutes left. Let's go.

30:42.308 --> 30:44.308
Hey, Len, what are you doing
on your pumpkin?

30:44.310 --> 30:46.410
I'm just trying to get
this teddy bear painted.

30:46.412 --> 30:47.511
We need the bear.

30:47.513 --> 30:48.712
Come on, come on.
You can pull it out.

30:48.714 --> 30:49.813
-Where's Brandy?
-Right here.

30:49.815 --> 30:51.315
Brandy, do you have
a second to hold?

30:51.317 --> 30:53.217
-No.
-No, I have no seconds.

30:53.219 --> 30:55.686
There is no way we're gonna
get this done in time.

30:55.688 --> 30:59.189
Pieces of fondant are starting
to peel off that pumpkin.

30:59.191 --> 31:01.258
To feel like everything's
going wrong at once

31:01.260 --> 31:02.693
is really overwhelming.

31:02.695 --> 31:04.194
Brandy, do you want
to paint really quickly,

31:04.196 --> 31:06.196
because I've got to
get the carrancas.

31:06.198 --> 31:07.898
-Lennie, we need the head.
-Coming through.

31:07.900 --> 31:09.032
Behind you. Behind you.

31:09.034 --> 31:11.468
Careful. Easy.

31:11.470 --> 31:12.703
All right.
Guys, the headboard's done.

31:12.705 --> 31:14.938
-What do you think?
-Really good. Nicely done.

31:14.940 --> 31:16.607
One minute left, teams.

31:16.609 --> 31:19.076
-Kim, can I put on toys?
-Where is that post?

31:19.078 --> 31:20.244
Oh, you broke it.
That's right.

31:20.246 --> 31:21.778
Come on, baby. Come on.
Come on.

31:21.780 --> 31:23.647
10, 9, 8...
Elizabeth, you are
coming in in the clutch.

31:23.649 --> 31:25.515
-7, 6...
-I need more color.

31:25.517 --> 31:27.818
5, 4...
I've got it. I'm going.
I'm going. I'm going.

31:27.820 --> 31:28.986
We're doing it.
We're doing it.

31:28.988 --> 31:31.588
3, 2, 1...

31:31.590 --> 31:35.459
Whoa.

31:35.461 --> 31:36.760
Whoo!

31:36.762 --> 31:38.328
Teams, we asked each of you

31:38.330 --> 31:41.198
to show us
the boogeyman's nightmare.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.467
Beastly Banshees,
let's talk about your display.

31:43.469 --> 31:45.168
CORRINA: So the boogeyman,
in our display,

31:45.170 --> 31:46.703
he's coming and creeping
into the room

31:46.705 --> 31:48.105
to scare the little kid,

31:48.107 --> 31:51.141
but he instead gets scared
by the monster under the bed.

31:51.143 --> 31:53.577
The boy's head is actually made
with rice-cereal treats.

31:53.579 --> 31:57.047
Our boogeyman is made
completely from pumpkin.

31:57.049 --> 31:58.649
We have isomalt eyes.

31:58.651 --> 32:00.217
We have a tasting
element, as well.

32:00.219 --> 32:03.754
The horns on his head.
They're matcha-tea bonbons.

32:03.756 --> 32:06.757
The tasting, as a whole, I think
the bite is a little too sweet.

32:06.759 --> 32:08.258
But it's the slight bitterness

32:08.260 --> 32:09.927
that you added
in your matcha ganache

32:09.929 --> 32:13.664
that is helping compensate
for the sweetness.

32:13.666 --> 32:17.901
I think the real standout piece
here is Tom's pumpkin creation.

32:17.903 --> 32:19.870
It's really terrifying.

32:19.872 --> 32:22.372
I like the detail
of the tentacles a lot,

32:22.374 --> 32:24.908
and the suctions
are very, very cool.

32:24.910 --> 32:26.877
I like the different characters
that you created.

32:26.879 --> 32:29.012
They look like they're
from different worlds,

32:29.014 --> 32:30.781
but they somehow,
kind of, come together.

32:30.783 --> 32:32.015
LI: Thanks, guys.

32:32.017 --> 32:33.317
Zesty Zombies.

32:33.319 --> 32:37.254
SHELBY: Our boogeyman, a mouse
crawled into his bedroom

32:37.256 --> 32:38.588
and scared him to death

32:38.590 --> 32:41.158
because the flashlight
made it seem like the mouse

32:41.160 --> 32:42.893
was holding a severed head.

32:42.895 --> 32:45.996
The boogeyman's head
was carved out of pumpkin.

32:45.998 --> 32:47.664
The mouse is potato.

32:47.666 --> 32:50.534
And then all the sugar pieces
are the creepy doll

32:50.536 --> 32:52.703
and then the back of his bed.

32:52.705 --> 32:55.806
So the tasting element
is Texas chocolate cake

32:55.808 --> 32:58.875
inside of
white chocolate shell.

32:58.877 --> 33:01.578
The fact that you have
the mouse shadow

33:01.580 --> 33:03.413
as the scary element
for our boogeyman,

33:03.415 --> 33:06.249
I think that's really cool
and very inventive.

33:06.251 --> 33:07.517
Thank you.

33:07.519 --> 33:10.220
The chocolate cake on the inside
was a little sweet,

33:10.222 --> 33:12.289
and I wish that
the cocoa nibs were,

33:12.291 --> 33:13.590
kind of, throughout the cake

33:13.592 --> 33:16.226
because then it would be
more textured and more crunch.

33:16.228 --> 33:19.663
Overall, the piece is a tiny bit
muddled for my taste,

33:19.665 --> 33:21.465
in terms of all the trash
that's on the floor,

33:21.467 --> 33:23.467
but the balance here works.

33:23.469 --> 33:25.836
I didn't need your explanation
at all about the story.

33:25.838 --> 33:27.838
It's all there.
It's crystal clear.

33:27.840 --> 33:29.439
Zesty Zombies,
thank you very much.

33:29.441 --> 33:30.707
Thank you.

33:30.709 --> 33:32.242
Grave Expectations.

33:32.244 --> 33:34.611
ELIZABETH: The boogeyman hunts
children in their dreams,

33:34.613 --> 33:36.046
and now, it's his turn.

33:36.048 --> 33:39.416
An alien bounty hunter
that hunts monsters.

33:39.418 --> 33:41.651
Our alien is our
pumpkin element.

33:41.653 --> 33:44.921
We have a pastillage
warrior-type blade.

33:44.923 --> 33:47.958
The boogeyman himself,
I made out of cake.

33:47.960 --> 33:50.594
For the tasting element today,
I have a cherry sablés

33:50.596 --> 33:52.896
with whipped
mascarpone panna cotta.

33:52.898 --> 33:54.197
The detail on the boogeyman,

33:54.199 --> 33:57.167
everything there is
extremely well done.

33:57.169 --> 34:01.338
The only thing is, I think that
the vertebrate of the alien,

34:01.340 --> 34:03.173
if there were just
a little bit of a curvature,

34:03.175 --> 34:05.342
he would just have a lot
more dynamic movement.

34:05.344 --> 34:08.278
But the tasting,
the cherry sablés

34:08.280 --> 34:10.514
was just a little bit soggy.

34:10.516 --> 34:12.516
I can't stop looking
at this boogeyman.

34:12.518 --> 34:14.418
I like the whole story
of the piece.

34:14.420 --> 34:17.187
It's very clear.

34:17.189 --> 34:18.522
BENNETT: Tricked-Out-Treats.

34:18.524 --> 34:20.891
TERESA: The boogeyman was
at home in his bed,

34:20.893 --> 34:23.827
but he is deathly afraid
of this horrifying snake.

34:23.829 --> 34:26.129
Here, he has a bag of children
that he snatched up

34:26.131 --> 34:27.597
to feed to the snake.

34:27.599 --> 34:28.932
The bed is cake.

34:28.934 --> 34:31.301
The front and the back
is built-in pastillage.

34:31.303 --> 34:33.470
The boogeyman itself
is made out of pumpkin.

34:33.472 --> 34:36.273
Our wonderful snake
is rice cereal treat.

34:36.275 --> 34:38.642
The tasting element is a milk
chocolate carranca

34:38.644 --> 34:41.378
filled with our caramelized
white chocolate cremeux.

34:41.380 --> 34:43.313
It's got a berry gelée.

34:43.315 --> 34:46.149
That carranca has got
some carranca-dunk.

34:46.151 --> 34:48.418
And the berry gelée,
it wasn't overpowering.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.520
It really just, kind of,
rounded out the whole thing.

34:50.522 --> 34:51.788
I really liked it.

34:51.790 --> 34:53.690
GUNN: The boogeyman on the bed
is just awesome.

34:53.692 --> 34:55.258
I love, like, the mouth
and the the teeth.

34:55.260 --> 34:58.695
The story itself could probably
use some more details.

34:58.697 --> 35:01.465
The snake feels
a little unfinished.

35:01.467 --> 35:03.834
The textures, I think
are really beautiful,

35:03.836 --> 35:06.837
but I think the reptilian scales
are kind of lost

35:06.839 --> 35:10.574
because you have a dark creature
in front of a dark background.

35:10.576 --> 35:12.742
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

35:12.744 --> 35:14.311
BENNETT: Monsters of Mayhem.

35:14.313 --> 35:16.446
SABRINA: Boogeyman's Nightmare
is this beast

35:16.448 --> 35:18.915
that he kept as his pet,

35:18.917 --> 35:22.752
but escaped and managed to sever
his head in the process.

35:22.754 --> 35:26.723
But he has magical powers,
and was still able to summon

35:26.725 --> 35:29.693
boogeyman
into another dimension.

35:29.695 --> 35:33.430
Our pumpkin elements
are the being's head

35:33.432 --> 35:36.833
and hands of the monsters
from the other dimension.

35:36.835 --> 35:41.605
Our sugar elements are
the being's eyeballs and flames.

35:41.607 --> 35:45.876
Rice cereal treats
covering the being's body.

35:45.878 --> 35:47.777
CESAR: We did a play off
the caramel apple.

35:47.779 --> 35:50.680
A sugar-candy shell, filled it
with an apple mousse,

35:50.682 --> 35:53.617
caramel apples,
and roasted peanut cake.

35:53.619 --> 35:56.987
The vanilla custard
and the apple taste together,

35:56.989 --> 35:58.555
I really liked it.

35:58.557 --> 36:01.224
I would've loved to see
that head up there,

36:01.226 --> 36:02.626
but you did a nice save

36:02.628 --> 36:04.127
considering
what you had to go through.

36:04.129 --> 36:07.197
The sculpture on the pumpkin,
very cool.

36:07.199 --> 36:11.101
The problem is that now that
the pumpkin is on the ground

36:11.103 --> 36:15.038
and not up on the head,
the story is confusing.

36:15.040 --> 36:17.774
I love the blue,
glowing neon flames.

36:17.776 --> 36:20.377
The color palette is very
beautiful and very pleasing.

36:20.379 --> 36:23.146
I'm not quite sure what
the ropes are behind him.

36:23.148 --> 36:24.981
I'm not sure if that
is for support.

36:24.983 --> 36:26.783
It's a lot of interesting
things to look at.

36:26.785 --> 36:29.419
-It's very spooky.
-Thanks, guys.

36:29.421 --> 36:32.355
All right,
Candy Cadavers, you're up.

36:32.357 --> 36:34.591
CYNTHIA: We have boogeyman
as a teenager.

36:34.593 --> 36:37.527
He is terrified of his mother
because he came home

36:37.529 --> 36:39.462
with a bad report card.

36:39.464 --> 36:41.932
Boogey's head
is made of pumpkin.

36:41.934 --> 36:44.234
His eyes are sugar.

36:44.236 --> 36:47.837
Arachnia, the mom, is made
of modeling chocolate

36:47.839 --> 36:50.240
with a pumpkin bottom.

36:50.242 --> 36:53.076
His report card is made
out of wafer paper.

36:53.078 --> 36:56.179
I created a white chocolate
filled with vanilla,

36:56.181 --> 36:59.115
cinnamon and also jalapeños.

36:59.117 --> 37:02.052
I love this piece.

37:02.054 --> 37:03.720
What you guys did
with that pumpkin,

37:03.722 --> 37:05.722
I haven't seen that done
before on "Halloween Wars."

37:05.724 --> 37:06.923
It's fantastic.

37:06.925 --> 37:09.659
Now, it's a little busy.

37:09.661 --> 37:12.062
There is so much going on
that my focal point

37:12.064 --> 37:13.496
is all over the place

37:13.498 --> 37:14.664
rather than focusing on
the great stuff

37:14.666 --> 37:15.699
that you guys did.

37:15.701 --> 37:17.667
LI: I love
the jalapeño spice to it.

37:17.669 --> 37:19.169
It had a real nice kick.

37:19.171 --> 37:20.937
I'll tell you what
I didn't like about it.

37:20.939 --> 37:23.673
The white chocolate was about
half an inch thick,

37:23.675 --> 37:27.877
and on top of that, you've got
a very sweet caramel.

37:27.879 --> 37:29.446
She's really beautiful.

37:29.448 --> 37:32.315
There's a real grace
and elegance to her posture.

37:32.317 --> 37:35.318
This is the most seamless
transition from pumpkin

37:35.320 --> 37:37.354
to cake body I've ever seen.

37:37.356 --> 37:40.924
These characters,
they're the showstoppers here.

37:40.926 --> 37:44.227
Teams, we'll meet you right back
here in just a few minutes.

37:44.229 --> 37:45.729
Our piece is pretty amazing.

37:45.731 --> 37:47.364
Winning this would
let everybody know

37:47.366 --> 37:49.232
that we are the team
to watch out for.

37:49.234 --> 37:51.568
I look around at other pieces
and I'm like,

37:51.570 --> 37:53.970
"Okay, I'm a little worried."

37:53.972 --> 37:55.872
This is a disaster.

37:55.874 --> 37:58.575
[ Sighs ] I just didn't want
to go home like this.

38:02.047 --> 38:03.446
All right, judges.

38:03.448 --> 38:06.383
Now, that is what I call a first
battle of "Halloween Wars."

38:06.385 --> 38:07.751
<i> [ Wolf howls ]</i>

38:07.753 --> 38:10.120
All right, what do we think
of Grave Expectations?

38:10.122 --> 38:13.356
The detail on the boogeyman
was very cool.

38:13.358 --> 38:15.125
It made it really
difficult for the alien

38:15.127 --> 38:17.427
because the alien
wasn't quite as defined

38:17.429 --> 38:18.595
and as finished as
that character.

38:18.597 --> 38:20.297
Yeah, and I feel
for that boogeyman.

38:20.299 --> 38:22.299
-He looks terrified.
-He is terrified.

38:22.301 --> 38:23.466
He's a goner.

38:23.468 --> 38:25.769
The sablés cookie was
just a little damp,

38:25.771 --> 38:29.072
but that was the only
thing that got me.

38:29.074 --> 38:31.207
Let's talk about
the Candied Cadavers.

38:31.209 --> 38:33.176
I just really enjoy
looking at this piece.

38:33.178 --> 38:34.511
TUCKER: What they did with
that first pumpkin,

38:34.513 --> 38:36.012
I thought that was
really inventive.

38:36.014 --> 38:38.748
-The seed tear is super sweet.
-That's really cool.

38:38.750 --> 38:40.417
I think Orly was
pretty ambitious

38:40.419 --> 38:41.785
with his tasting treat.

38:41.787 --> 38:44.054
You know, to make a caramel
perfect is not that easy.

38:44.056 --> 38:46.356
But then, half an inch
of white chocolate?

38:46.358 --> 38:48.158
-It's completely unnecessary.
-Mm-hmm.

38:48.160 --> 38:49.659
Let's talk about
the Zesty Zombies.

38:49.661 --> 38:51.528
I love the fact that
their hideous monster

38:51.530 --> 38:54.397
that's scaring the boogeyman
is a tricked-out little mouse.

38:54.399 --> 38:56.299
LI: Lenny created
some fun characters.

38:56.301 --> 38:58.134
Because those pieces
are so small

38:58.136 --> 39:00.570
and there's not a lot
of sculpting work there,

39:00.572 --> 39:02.472
I want to see more from him.

39:02.474 --> 39:04.841
With the tasting element
because it's enrobed

39:04.843 --> 39:06.076
with white chocolate,

39:06.078 --> 39:09.479
the cake itself
just became too sweet.

39:09.481 --> 39:11.715
Then we need to talk about
Monsters of Mayhem.

39:11.717 --> 39:13.817
LI:
Yeah, I really felt for them.

39:13.819 --> 39:15.952
Because they didn't get
the head on the body,

39:15.954 --> 39:18.088
the story just doesn't
really make sense to me,

39:18.090 --> 39:19.255
and that's a problem.

39:19.257 --> 39:22.158
The story of it
is a little bit muddled.

39:22.160 --> 39:23.727
I will say, though,
that vanilla custard

39:23.729 --> 39:26.629
and the apple taste together,
I really liked it.

39:26.631 --> 39:28.998
All right, what do we think
of Tricked-Out-Treats?

39:29.000 --> 39:31.935
I'm just not a fan of that
two-headed snake monster.

39:31.937 --> 39:34.337
I actually am a fan
of the two-headed snake,

39:34.339 --> 39:35.872
but he didn't finish it.

39:35.874 --> 39:38.141
They had a very nice character
with their boogeyman face,

39:38.143 --> 39:40.110
but it felt like there was
so many elements of this piece

39:40.112 --> 39:41.544
that just, kind of,
didn't come together.

39:41.546 --> 39:43.079
I liked that treat, a lot.

39:43.081 --> 39:45.548
LI: It was really well balanced.
It wasn't too sweet.

39:45.550 --> 39:47.417
The cocoa nibs added
a really nice crunch

39:47.419 --> 39:49.753
throughout the whole piece.

39:49.755 --> 39:52.122
And then, finally, we have
the Beastly Banshees.

39:52.124 --> 39:54.224
It doesn't have
any movement to it,

39:54.226 --> 39:55.892
and I don't really know
what's happening.

39:55.894 --> 39:58.895
But, I have to say, Tom's
pumpkin carving in the back,

39:58.897 --> 40:01.998
he did such a good job that
my eyes immediately went there.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.334
And, you know, with the tasting,
the matcha tea,

40:04.336 --> 40:06.269
because it does have
a little bit of bitterness,

40:06.271 --> 40:07.737
I think it saves it,

40:07.739 --> 40:10.407
but the white chocolate is
overpowering.

40:10.409 --> 40:13.343
All right.
Well, we have six amazing teams,

40:13.345 --> 40:16.012
and it's already time
to send one of them home.

40:16.014 --> 40:18.915
-Do we know who it is?
-Yeah.

40:18.917 --> 40:20.049
Yeah, I think so.

40:20.051 --> 40:22.986
<i> [ Wolf howls ]</i>

40:22.988 --> 40:25.755
Teams, for this very
first spine chiller,

40:25.757 --> 40:27.390
we asked you to
show us a monster

40:27.392 --> 40:31.161
so terrifying it would give
the boogeyman nightmares.

40:31.163 --> 40:33.797
Today, you six teams went
all out with creativity

40:33.799 --> 40:35.432
and unmatched skill,

40:35.434 --> 40:37.934
and there was one team
whose design was clever

40:37.936 --> 40:41.771
but also a little more
seamless than the rest.

40:41.773 --> 40:45.842
Congratulations...

Candied Cadavers.

40:48.180 --> 40:50.013

CYNTHIA: We win.
I can't believe it.

40:51.383 --> 40:52.749
Actually, I can believe it.

are total rockstars.

40:56.688 --> 40:58.788
Now, for the bad news.

40:58.790 --> 41:01.391
One team has to be
the first to go home,

41:01.393 --> 41:04.994

to one key mistake.

41:04.996 --> 41:07.430
Tricked-Out-Treats,
your carved-pumpkin boogeyman

41:07.432 --> 41:10.266
thrilled the judges,
but your snake monster

41:10.268 --> 41:13.736
made the rest of
your design feel disjointed.

41:13.738 --> 41:15.705
And Monsters of Mayhem.

41:15.707 --> 41:17.674
The judges thought
your caramel apple treat

41:17.676 --> 41:19.275
was out of this world.

41:19.277 --> 41:23.480
Unfortunately, your monster
was missing its pumpkin head.

really get a chance
