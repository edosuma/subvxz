WEBVTT

11:35.653 --> 11:36.904
Well, that was easy.

11:41.742 --> 11:43.869
Hey, Judy, how we looking
on those charges?

11:44.370 --> 11:45.496
Don't rush me.

11:45.579 --> 11:47.790
We're kind of on a time limit here, babe.

11:49.083 --> 11:50.292
This thing hits 73--

11:50.376 --> 11:52.169
You want this done right or right now?

11:52.253 --> 11:53.212
Preferably both.

11:53.295 --> 11:54.672
Maybe a little bit quicker, huh?

11:54.755 --> 11:57.758
-I do this wrong, we're dead.
-<i>Not trying to stress you out.</i>

11:57.842 --> 12:01.303
-We got to release the water.
-Judy, 72.6.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.515
Judy, babe, what's going on?

12:04.598 --> 12:06.267
<i>We are running out of time.</i>

12:06.350 --> 12:07.727
-<i>Judy…</i>

12:09.687 --> 12:11.439
Leo, something's wrong.
She's not answering.

12:11.522 --> 12:13.607
Judy. Judy, can you hear us?

12:13.691 --> 12:15.401
<i>-Ava's finger is on the button.</i>
<i>-Get out.</i>

12:15.484 --> 12:16.444
<i>She'll blow it.</i>

12:16.527 --> 12:17.570
-<i>Get out.</i>
-Fuck it.

12:26.370 --> 12:27.580
Don't you fucking dare.

12:27.663 --> 12:28.956
Wait. Please.

12:33.419 --> 12:34.253
Judy.

12:36.213 --> 12:37.798
-We gotta go.
-I'm not finished.

12:37.882 --> 12:39.258
Ava's going to blow it.

12:39.341 --> 12:40.509
This is what I do.

12:42.470 --> 12:43.763
It's her or us.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.226
Okay, perfect.

12:50.603 --> 12:51.437
Okay, come on.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.514
That's too much water, right?

13:26.597 --> 13:29.391
-Judy, you okay, babe?
-Judy?

13:30.059 --> 13:30.893
Judy.

13:32.311 --> 13:33.521
-RJ?
-We got to go.

13:33.604 --> 13:35.940
No. We're gonna wait
till we know she's all right.

13:36.023 --> 13:38.025
We'd be done for.
She can take care of herself.

13:38.108 --> 13:39.360
-We gotta go.
-Okay.

13:39.944 --> 13:41.111
We got to move!

13:41.195 --> 13:43.614
Safes two, three, five and seven
have the bonds.

13:43.697 --> 13:44.865
Let's get to it.

14:08.472 --> 14:09.473
Don't fuck it up.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.269
Yeah, good luck to you too.

14:23.195 --> 14:25.406
Hannah, are you keeping
an eye on the feeds?

14:25.489 --> 14:27.116
Temperature sensors just went off.

14:27.199 --> 14:29.535
<i>-Just a glitch. I took care of it.</i>
-Okay.

14:29.618 --> 14:32.204
<i>We've got it handled.</i>
<i>Carlos and I are on it.</i>

14:32.288 --> 14:34.748
No, he's on his way down.
I just called him.

14:34.832 --> 14:37.751
<i>That's not necessary, sir.</i>
<i>The system is on full lockdown.</i>

14:38.377 --> 14:39.837
Dad, come on.

14:40.588 --> 14:41.755
Uh…

14:41.839 --> 14:44.049
Yeah. I'm in the middle
of something, buddy.

14:44.133 --> 14:45.092
Give me a second.

14:45.175 --> 14:48.387
Go be with your family.
I'll call if the smallest thing comes up.

14:48.470 --> 14:49.305
<i>Okay.</i>

14:51.390 --> 14:52.224
Dad.

14:56.353 --> 14:57.187
Let's go.

14:58.939 --> 15:00.858
This place is filling up fast.

15:00.941 --> 15:01.984
We gotta move.

15:04.528 --> 15:06.155
You went past it. Go back.

15:08.324 --> 15:09.199
Oi!

15:09.700 --> 15:11.619
Do it right. Fucking amateur.

15:11.702 --> 15:14.872
Yeah, 'cause the pro's a fucking moron
who got his hand shot up.

15:14.955 --> 15:18.125
Yeah, when this is over,
you won't have to see this moron again.

15:19.418 --> 15:20.336
Or his wife.

15:23.047 --> 15:25.466
I've done mine, main man.
I'm not really drowning.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.596
Celebrate later. On to the next.

16:17.768 --> 16:18.602
Whoo!

17:37.973 --> 17:40.309
It's time. I should make the call.

17:40.392 --> 17:42.561
Okay. We get this moving
and then light it up.

17:42.644 --> 17:43.479
Okay.

17:52.863 --> 17:53.697
All right.

17:57.826 --> 17:58.744
It's happening!

18:11.090 --> 18:12.966
Oh, shit. Is that--

18:13.050 --> 18:14.218
Gun fire. Come on!

18:39.535 --> 18:41.161
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, wait!

18:54.967 --> 18:57.719
-Well, who the fuck is--
-Feds. Leo, we got feds.

18:57.803 --> 18:58.971
We're fucking made.

18:59.054 --> 19:01.014
That's not our elevator.
They're not here for us.

19:01.098 --> 19:02.683
Let's keep crackin'. Next safe.

19:03.517 --> 19:04.351
Let's go!

19:36.717 --> 19:38.093
-Clear.
-Clear.

19:42.264 --> 19:43.599
You sure it's the 59th?

19:43.682 --> 19:45.017
That's what she said.

19:45.100 --> 19:47.186
It's where the gunshots were coming from.

20:08.916 --> 20:09.791
She set us up.

20:10.584 --> 20:11.668
Fuck!

20:13.128 --> 20:13.962
Come on.

20:23.805 --> 20:25.265
Nazan, let's get out of here.

20:32.105 --> 20:33.023
Do you hear that?

20:38.820 --> 20:40.030
-Come on, let's go.
-Shh!

20:43.033 --> 20:44.534
Nazan, there's nobody up here.

20:49.539 --> 20:50.374
Jesus!

20:51.875 --> 20:53.210
-Nazan!
-Shit.

21:11.728 --> 21:14.856
It's a signal jammer.
They're putting out a fake video feed.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.233
SLS?

21:16.316 --> 21:18.151
It's, uh, a finance company, right?

21:18.235 --> 21:19.403
In the basement.

21:20.153 --> 21:22.281
We're 60 stories away
from the real action.

21:22.948 --> 21:25.075
Pull them. Pull them all.

21:35.168 --> 21:38.380
I don't know why I can't leave school
and come and work for you.

21:39.631 --> 21:43.719
Well, I tend to prefer
my employees have college degrees.

21:44.845 --> 21:46.680
I'd learn a lot more on the job.

21:49.016 --> 21:50.142
Listen. Listen.

21:53.812 --> 21:55.605
I'm not telling you what to do.

21:56.523 --> 22:00.193
I'm just saying
these decisions that we make,

22:01.153 --> 22:03.071
they have consequences.

22:03.155 --> 22:05.741
-Good or bad, they matter.
-Yeah.

22:05.824 --> 22:07.951
Everything that happens in your future

22:08.702 --> 22:10.954
comes from the choices
you make in your past.

22:11.705 --> 22:13.498
Nothing you can do can change that.

22:13.582 --> 22:14.791
So think about it.

22:15.959 --> 22:16.793
Thank you.

22:17.419 --> 22:18.253
Come here.

22:20.088 --> 22:22.507
Thanks a lot, Dad.
I'll give it some thought.

22:23.175 --> 22:25.469
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

22:26.011 --> 22:27.763
-Dad, what's going on?

22:28.180 --> 22:30.557
-We're being robbed.
<i>-Everything looks fine.</i>

22:30.640 --> 22:33.101
Everything is far from fucking fine!
We're being attacked!

22:33.185 --> 22:34.853
-Lock it down!
<i>-I'll meet you down there.</i>

22:34.936 --> 22:36.855
-I gotta go.
-They said stay inside.

22:37.481 --> 22:39.399
-Stay inside.
-Hon, I gotta go.

22:47.657 --> 22:48.575
Shit.

22:50.327 --> 22:51.745
Come on. Let's go.

23:00.796 --> 23:01.630
Shit.

23:20.982 --> 23:22.234
That's all of them, isn't it?

23:22.317 --> 23:24.069
<i>Yeah. We're about to send them up.</i>

23:31.993 --> 23:33.078
One more.

23:34.162 --> 23:35.956
You said only these four had bonds.

23:36.039 --> 23:39.000
We come all this way,
we're not going to get every last bit?

23:40.877 --> 23:42.629
You can never have too many yachts.

24:04.317 --> 24:05.944
Package coming your way.
You set?

24:06.027 --> 24:07.821
<i>Copy, check, let's do it.</i>

24:07.904 --> 24:09.156
Take care of our babies.

24:41.271 --> 24:43.773
Mama's gonna shopping spree.

25:02.334 --> 25:03.919
Judy, I'm not seeing the bonds.

25:04.002 --> 25:05.837
<i>Give it a second.</i>
<i>I just sent it up.</i>

25:05.921 --> 25:07.297
<i>Cool. Thank you.</i>

25:13.094 --> 25:16.056
<i>RJ, you get anything yet?</i>
<i>I'm getting a little nervous here.</i>

25:16.139 --> 25:19.059
-<i>I still don't see anything.</i>
-<i>Okay. That's strange.</i>

25:19.142 --> 25:21.144
Strange. I… I don't like strange.

25:21.228 --> 25:22.979
<i>Yeah, neither do I.</i>

25:37.160 --> 25:38.495
Okay, I got it.

25:38.578 --> 25:41.706
<i>Great. Load it up.</i>
<i>We'll be with you in a second, kiddo.</i>

25:57.847 --> 25:59.349
We're done. We should go.

26:00.850 --> 26:01.810
Pick up the pace.

26:03.353 --> 26:05.480
We have what we need.
Let's go. Come on.

26:08.733 --> 26:10.068
Fuckin' feds.

26:17.158 --> 26:18.994
Nah, I've had a gutful of this shit.

26:19.786 --> 26:21.580
I got everything I need upstairs.

26:22.872 --> 26:25.125
You want it, you do it.

26:26.876 --> 26:28.128
You're all greedy cunts!

26:35.135 --> 26:35.969
Leo.

26:44.227 --> 26:45.228
Just one last number.

27:40.825 --> 27:42.077
What the fuck is this?

27:42.786 --> 27:43.953
I don't know.

27:57.759 --> 27:59.719
-Go! Go, go now!
-Go!

28:01.554 --> 28:02.555
Come on!

28:02.639 --> 28:03.682
-Leo!
-Leo!

28:03.765 --> 28:04.599
Let's go!

28:06.643 --> 28:08.812
-What happened?
-Mistakes were made. Let's go.

28:08.895 --> 28:11.690
-This isn't the plan.
-It's a new plan. Our plan. Ha-ha!

28:11.773 --> 28:14.150
It's what we wanted, right?
You, me, and a ton of cash.

28:14.234 --> 28:16.027
I'll get you a field of butterflies.

28:16.111 --> 28:17.487
-Wait. They'll be trapped.
-Listen.

28:17.570 --> 28:19.531
They're fucking dinosaurs. All right?

28:20.115 --> 28:21.324
Come on. This is their tarpit.

28:21.408 --> 28:23.535
Just fucking let them drown.
Let's go. Come on!

28:25.537 --> 28:26.371
Let's go.

28:33.086 --> 28:34.796
-Hey, guys. We did it.
-Bite me.

28:36.840 --> 28:39.008
Stop! RJ! RJ! RJ!

28:39.092 --> 28:41.928
-Get in the truck, Judy.
-Come on. Okay.

28:42.011 --> 28:43.888
RJ, look at me. RJ, look at me.

28:43.972 --> 28:45.181
-In the truck.
-Can you get up?

28:45.265 --> 28:46.766
Get the fuck up. RJ, you're fine.

28:46.850 --> 28:49.352
RJ, look at me. You're fine.
Come on, get up.

28:49.436 --> 28:52.147
Get in the fucking truck, Judy. Now.

28:53.857 --> 28:55.358
Where's the fucking keys?

29:02.157 --> 29:03.992
In my ass, you fucking idiot?

29:04.743 --> 29:06.286
You shot me in the ass.

29:07.704 --> 29:09.914
You can't even fucking shoot right.

29:09.998 --> 29:10.832
Eh?

29:12.500 --> 29:13.752
How bloody good are ya?

29:15.670 --> 29:18.131
You need to be nicer to people.

29:57.295 --> 29:58.213
You okay? Come on.

29:58.296 --> 29:59.380
You two go on.

29:59.464 --> 30:01.800
Are you hurt? Come on, let's go.

30:01.883 --> 30:03.426
I'm all right. Just go.

30:05.011 --> 30:07.347
Go. We'll meet you up top.

30:25.240 --> 30:26.574
You're a bloody lifesaver.

30:27.242 --> 30:28.785
Eh? That's my girl.

30:30.161 --> 30:31.162
Help me move him.

30:33.081 --> 30:35.208
Hey! Get his legs, come on.

30:36.376 --> 30:37.377
Come on.

30:39.921 --> 30:40.755
That's it.

30:41.881 --> 30:42.715
Come on.

30:47.887 --> 30:51.099
Hey. Listen to me.
You did the right thing, okay?

30:52.350 --> 30:53.184
Yeah.

30:54.269 --> 30:55.687
Hell of a shot too.

30:56.396 --> 30:57.397
Hey.

30:58.898 --> 31:01.776
It's okay. It's all right.
Come on, let's get out of here.

31:22.589 --> 31:23.631
Isn't it enough?

31:24.674 --> 31:25.633
All of that money--

31:25.717 --> 31:27.260
It's never been about the money.

31:27.343 --> 31:30.096
But it's a pretty nice consolation prize.

31:31.514 --> 31:33.391
You and me just…

31:35.518 --> 31:37.145
laying around together.

31:42.942 --> 31:44.569
Abbasi's going to be here soon.

31:45.570 --> 31:47.947
I got to make sure
she's got something to find.

31:48.031 --> 31:49.782
I'll see you back at the shop.

31:54.203 --> 31:55.872
Don't you drown on me.

31:57.415 --> 31:58.791
I got a hell of a flutter kick.

32:17.727 --> 32:20.188
Stanley! Where are ya?

32:21.356 --> 32:22.774
You're a fucking worm, mate.

32:23.274 --> 32:24.233
You brat!

32:25.026 --> 32:26.194
If you want her so bad,

32:26.277 --> 32:28.863
why don't you come out here
and fight me for her?

32:28.947 --> 32:31.157
Man to man, Stanley.

32:31.240 --> 32:32.575
Eh? What do you say?

32:33.868 --> 32:35.745
I'm on one fucking leg, mate.

32:38.122 --> 32:39.624
Where are ya, you little cunt?

34:57.178 --> 34:59.806
-Hey! Get out of the truck!

34:59.889 --> 35:01.349
I'm done playing games, Ava!

35:02.558 --> 35:04.102
I will send Teresa back!

35:04.185 --> 35:07.063
She's gone. You'll never find her.

35:08.356 --> 35:09.190
Let it go.

35:10.274 --> 35:11.859
Stop! Stop!

35:17.740 --> 35:19.158
Hey!

37:33.251 --> 37:34.377
On your knees.

38:05.157 --> 38:06.117
Hey, Pop.

38:13.416 --> 38:15.751
-You okay?
-Wait, wait, you shouldn't be here.

38:15.835 --> 38:18.713
That's not part of the plan.
It's not safe for you.

38:18.796 --> 38:20.631
No, I can hold my own.

38:20.715 --> 38:23.175
<i>Hey, Hannah,</i>
<i>what's taking so long?</i>

38:24.885 --> 38:26.095
Is-- Is that Liz?

38:26.804 --> 38:27.805
<i>Uh, hello?</i>

38:27.888 --> 38:30.891
We may have made
a little change to the plan.

38:31.475 --> 38:34.353
<i>Hannah, come on.</i>
<i>These bonds aren't gonna move themselves.</i>

38:35.521 --> 38:38.899
No, no. No, baby. You…

38:42.361 --> 38:43.487
How much did you take?

38:44.822 --> 38:45.865
All of it.

38:47.283 --> 38:48.117
Why?

38:49.493 --> 38:50.453
For you.

38:51.620 --> 38:53.372
Because you couldn't help yourself.

38:54.165 --> 38:56.917
I tried to protect you
from the people you were robbing.

38:57.001 --> 38:58.377
The Triplets are not the people

38:58.461 --> 39:00.838
you can take their stuff
and walk off into the night.

39:00.921 --> 39:01.797
They'll find you.

39:02.882 --> 39:03.799
They'll kill you.

39:03.883 --> 39:05.426
<i>But you wouldn't listen.</i>

39:06.093 --> 39:07.887
<i>So, I came up with a plan.</i>

39:08.554 --> 39:12.558
<i>I'm giving them their bonds back,</i>
<i>washing their money for them, really.</i>

39:12.641 --> 39:14.310
It feels a little dangerous, no?

39:14.393 --> 39:17.188
Oh, no, it's surprisingly simple.
It's already worked out.

39:17.730 --> 39:20.274
<i>Their insurance covers the missing assets.</i>

39:20.358 --> 39:24.028
They can write it off as loss
and pocket the money themselves.

39:24.111 --> 39:26.364
The rich get richer and we get to live.

39:28.783 --> 39:31.410
<i>By morning, the bonds would</i>
<i>be on the way to the Caymans.</i>

39:32.078 --> 39:35.164
<i>I made promises. To Ava, to Stan--</i>

39:35.247 --> 39:36.374
<i>To a lot of people.</i>

39:36.874 --> 39:38.042
<i>To me.</i>

39:39.001 --> 39:42.922
<i>After you found me,</i>
<i>told me who Roger was and what he'd done,</i>

39:43.005 --> 39:44.673
<i>I hoped to get you back one day.</i>

39:46.092 --> 39:48.552
<i>As a partner, as a father.</i>

39:49.512 --> 39:50.638
I had 17 years.

39:52.014 --> 39:53.974
-You're angry.
-Yeah, I was.

39:54.058 --> 39:55.768
But I've had time to think

39:57.061 --> 40:02.483
about who we are and who I am
and I do know who I'm not.

40:04.068 --> 40:05.528
I'm not Roger's VP.

40:06.612 --> 40:08.406
And I'm not your inside man.

40:11.409 --> 40:15.246
I am the daughter of Ray and Lily Vernon.

40:17.164 --> 40:20.709
<i>And that girl's got to figure out</i>
<i>what it's like to go her own way.</i>

40:22.044 --> 40:24.422
And you, you're Ray Vernon,

40:25.381 --> 40:27.967
and you're gonna do things
that you came here to do.

40:28.050 --> 40:30.136
So tell me not to…

40:30.219 --> 40:31.095
Mm-mm.

40:31.220 --> 40:33.889
I am done trying to change you, Pop.

40:36.225 --> 40:37.977
You got to do what's in your heart.

40:51.907 --> 40:53.451
Help!

40:56.370 --> 40:57.538
I'm sorry.

41:00.040 --> 41:01.625
We'll speak again, Papa.

41:03.210 --> 41:04.378
<i>Whenever you're ready.</i>

41:05.963 --> 41:07.381
<i>I named her Lily.</i>

41:11.469 --> 41:12.845
Now show me where you're brave.

41:16.474 --> 41:17.850
Show me where you're brave.

41:28.777 --> 41:31.530
Show me where you're strong.

41:32.656 --> 41:34.450
Show me where you're strong.
