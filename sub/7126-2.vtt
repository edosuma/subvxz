- To Sam!
- Sam.

00:24.750 --> 00:28.959
One year ago today,
I was hit by that car

00:28.959 --> 00:32.458
that knocked me out of that old life
and into my new life.

00:32.458 --> 00:34.792
So this is to the car,

00:34.792 --> 00:37.291
to old friends
who are actually new friends,

00:37.291 --> 00:39.208
which is kind of neat.

00:39.208 --> 00:41.834
- Hear, hear.
- I know, so awful.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.709
- What was?
- The day it happened, remember?

00:45.709 --> 00:48.709
Oh, the day I got amnesia?
Not well, no.

00:48.709 --> 00:52.583
Oh, when they called me and told me
that you were in a coma,

00:52.583 --> 00:56.458
Sam, I cried and I cried
and I prayed to God:

00:56.458 --> 01:01.750
"God, please make me stop crying,
My eyes are gonna get so puffy."

01:03.542 --> 01:07.417
- More, please.
- I had to go to court the next day.

01:07.417 --> 01:09.792
Point is is that I am alive

01:09.792 --> 01:13.458
and that my life is so much better
than it was before.

01:13.458 --> 01:15.125
- Hear, hear!
- Yeah, how so?

01:16.458 --> 01:17.834
What do you mean, how so?

01:17.834 --> 01:21.291
Well, last year you had a job
and you were living with your boyfriend.

01:21.291 --> 01:25.166
And this year you don't have a job
and you're living with your ex-boyfriend.

01:26.875 --> 01:31.125
- More, please.
- You know, speaking of boyfriends,

01:31.667 --> 01:33.542
I'm gonna be spending a week
at Chase's.

01:33.542 --> 01:35.917
We're kind of entering a new phase
of our relationship.

01:37.125 --> 01:38.667
One week, huh?

01:38.667 --> 01:41.041
A little trial run, huh?

01:41.041 --> 01:44.458
A little test drive, see how you perform?

01:46.291 --> 01:47.792
More, please.

01:49.458 --> 01:51.542
A whole new start is so exciting.

01:51.542 --> 01:54.917
It's like this year was school,
and now you're graduating.

01:54.917 --> 01:58.000
Graduating, yes, that's it. That's it.

What are you gonna do you with the rest
of your life all the way until you die?

SAM: Did we leave the bottle inside?
DENA: No, come on. Come on. Come on.

02:11.542 --> 02:14.667
- I don't know.
- You can do acrobats. Advertising.

02:14.667 --> 02:17.000
No, I don't like commercials.
You know what I wanna do?

02:17.000 --> 02:19.917
I wanna do something that's actually
gonna help people, you know?

02:19.917 --> 02:22.625
Acupuncture, African relief.

02:22.625 --> 02:25.917
Oh, my God, are we gonna go
through the whole alphabet?

02:25.917 --> 02:29.083
No. But if she wants to be an acrobat,
then we're done.

02:29.083 --> 02:31.542
Wait, hold on one second.
What'd you say about the Africa?

02:31.542 --> 02:33.041
No, you do not want that.

02:33.041 --> 02:34.750
- Want what?
- The Africa.

- if she's at Chapman's all week.
- Wait, come on, stay. It's like old times.

Well, you weren't complaining
last night.

with a massive head injury. Nice work.

Look, I tried to wait
until you sobered up,

03:44.750 --> 03:47.041
but then you got naked,
and I lost my train of thought.

03:47.041 --> 03:49.917
You know, maybe Andrea's right.
You know, maybe I haven't changed.

You know, maybe my true self
just freed up by alcohol is my old self,

doesn't need to change. This feels right.

You guys can help too,

04:40.125 --> 04:42.250

where, for $10,

04:42.250 --> 04:46.417
you can send over a mosquito net
and help a child from getting malaria.

04:46.417 --> 04:48.291
Seems a little high for a net.

04:48.291 --> 04:51.375
Do you need $10, is that it?
Just take it out of my purse.

04:51.375 --> 04:53.917
No, I need to go to Africa.

and be anything that I want to now.

05:59.792 --> 06:02.667

- No, you.

11:15.041 --> 11:16.250
You.

11:16.250 --> 11:17.792
Did Africa get hit by a car?

11:17.792 --> 11:21.125
Did Africa break up with its boyfriend,
who still won't move out of its apartment?

11:21.625 --> 11:25.458
- It's been a really hard year.
- Hard? Africa should be helping you.

11:25.458 --> 11:27.458
You have two weeks.
No one knows where you are.

11:27.458 --> 11:29.417
You need to go somewhere
good for you.

11:29.417 --> 11:30.792
Okay.

11:30.792 --> 11:33.959
Okay, but I'm not--
I'm not getting any shots.

11:33.959 --> 11:35.166
Oh, you might.

11:38.959 --> 11:41.583
- Three shots over here.
- Whoo!

11:41.583 --> 11:43.959
Oh, hello. Oh, hello.

I so needed this.

11:58.959 --> 12:01.458
You probably saved more lives
by not going.

12:01.458 --> 12:03.500
SAM:
Exactly. Exactly.

12:04.417 --> 12:06.709
Hey, you know, maybe--
Maybe I should get a T-shirt

12:06.709 --> 12:10.166
so that I get one of those building-latrines-
in-the-sun-all-day tan lines

12:10.166 --> 12:12.208
for when I get back.
What do you think? Yeah?

- Hey.

12:13.375 --> 12:14.917
- Body shot?
- No, thanks.

12:14.917 --> 12:16.625
No. No phones.

No, we're in Africa.

12:29.208 --> 12:32.250

his old text messages.

12:32.250 --> 12:35.375

you're dead.

12:35.375 --> 12:37.375

12:41.917 --> 12:43.709
- Me too.
- Really?

12:43.709 --> 12:45.125
- All right.
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

12:45.125 --> 12:47.083
So are your parents riding you
all the time?

12:47.083 --> 12:49.166
Like, "Get off the couch. Get a job."

12:49.166 --> 12:50.917
That is exactly what they are doing.

12:50.917 --> 12:52.750
Yeah, but you just need
some space, right?

12:52.750 --> 12:54.792
Yeah, just to find out who I am.

12:54.792 --> 12:58.083
Yeah, just to cut loose, stop thinking,
have some sex.

12:58.083 --> 13:01.125
Not worry so much every single second
about the future.

13:01.125 --> 13:03.583
- Right, and just have some sex.
- Not happening, Brent.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.750
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

13:07.250 --> 13:08.792
Sam.

13:08.792 --> 13:10.291
I just checked my messages,

13:10.291 --> 13:13.333

he said:

13:13.333 --> 13:17.375
"Are you okay? I love you very much.
I miss you. I hope you're not dead."

13:17.375 --> 13:19.458
- "Dead"?
- That's not our usual sign-off.

13:19.458 --> 13:21.959
It's usually, "I hope you still like me."

She's not fine, Howard. She's dead.

13:48.750 --> 13:53.125
She is not dead. Will you stop that?
They're not reporting any casualties.

13:55.917 --> 13:59.041
Well, I'll be sure to thank
the pharmaceutical industry.

13:59.834 --> 14:03.625
Also because she appeared to me
in a vision on my walk that night.

14:03.625 --> 14:06.041
To tell me she's at peace.

14:06.667 --> 14:09.542

there's no phone service.

when we get home.

14:22.208 --> 14:25.041
We can't go home, Andrea.
There is no way in or out.

Maybe the hotel will give us free drinks.
Like when you're stuck on the tarmac.

14:30.125 --> 14:31.709
You are not helping.

14:32.083 --> 14:37.542
- What--? I wanna stay. We're having fun.
- And that's all you wanted, isn't it?

14:38.083 --> 14:40.709
You didn't wanna help me,
you just wanted a vacation.

14:40.709 --> 14:42.834
I wanted a vacation with you.

you and me.

I'm watching us just go like this.

14:49.333 --> 14:52.709
And I have been trying
to get you back to normal.

14:52.709 --> 14:55.000
You were my Africa.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.291
You know, I am so sorry that I turned out
to be a better person than I was.

14:58.291 --> 15:01.917
So am I,
because where does that leave me?

15:01.917 --> 15:04.208
I mean, where do I fit in?

15:05.083 --> 15:07.583
I mean, what purpose do I have
in your life?

15:11.500 --> 15:13.083
Right now?

15:13.083 --> 15:14.709
I need you to get us out of here.

15:15.250 --> 15:20.834
Right now, I need you to dig down
deep inside of that devious brain of yours

15:20.834 --> 15:22.875
and help come up with a plan.

15:25.041 --> 15:27.709
- I guess I can sleep with a guard.
- Thank you.

15:27.709 --> 15:29.125
- Two if I had to.
- Okay, good.

15:29.125 --> 15:31.792
And then I will--
I'll commandeer a Humvee.

15:31.792 --> 15:33.375
No, no, you can't drive stick.

15:33.375 --> 15:36.208
See, this is why I need you,
because you know these things.

15:36.834 --> 15:39.000
Howard. Howard, look at this.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.041
It's a picture of this 12-foot snake
they caught in Africa,

15:42.041 --> 15:45.250
and that big bulge in the middle
is what it just ate.

15:45.250 --> 15:50.250
Now, they're saying it's a goat or a dog,
but I think we both know who's in there.

15:50.250 --> 15:53.542
No, no, no, it's in the Congo, Regina.

15:53.542 --> 15:55.250
See, that's nowhere near
where Sam was.

15:55.250 --> 15:57.917

Oh, a mother knows her own child.

15:57.917 --> 16:01.625
Hey, everyone, I'm back from Africa.

16:01.625 --> 16:03.959
- Oh, Samantha.
- Sammy, oh, my God.

16:03.959 --> 16:05.917
Oh, my God. Sam.

16:06.583 --> 16:10.667

- Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm just like--

16:10.667 --> 16:15.542
Oh, gonna turn in because Zulu time
has got me all wonky, so...

16:15.542 --> 16:18.125
REGINA: Let us at least look at you.
- What happened over there?

16:18.125 --> 16:20.667
Oh, you know,
I have suppressed so much of it.

16:20.667 --> 16:24.750
It's probably just gonna be years
and years before I can even talk about it.

16:24.750 --> 16:27.250
But how did you get out?

16:27.250 --> 16:29.166
One of us slept with a guard.

16:29.166 --> 16:30.583
Andrea went with you?

16:30.583 --> 16:33.041
Mm-hm. Then we swam.

16:33.041 --> 16:35.542
- Yeah. Across a river.
- River?

16:35.542 --> 16:36.959
There's no rivers in that part.

16:37.750 --> 16:41.250
- Excuse me, were you there?
- Will you stop interrogating her?

16:41.250 --> 16:43.166
All that matters is that she's home.

16:43.166 --> 16:45.834
- Can I ask her if she saw a monkey?
- No.

16:47.417 --> 16:49.083
I knew you were safe.

16:49.083 --> 16:50.667
I had a vision on my walk.

16:50.667 --> 16:53.792
And you told me not to worry,
and that I was a good mother.

16:53.792 --> 16:56.083
I'm proud of you, kiddo.
Didn't know you had it in you.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.875
Yeah, well...

16:57.875 --> 17:00.750
And don't forget to call Todd.
We phoned him when we saw the news.

17:00.750 --> 17:02.500
I'm sure he's as worried as we were.

17:03.625 --> 17:05.208
Great.

17:07.875 --> 17:12.417
Hey, Frank, I've been trying to call Todd,
but his voice mail's full. Is he up there?

17:12.417 --> 17:15.959
He is not. He raced out of here
this morning in a state of agitation.

17:15.959 --> 17:18.709
Said he had some shots to get
before it was too late.

17:18.709 --> 17:21.166
What? Shots?

17:21.542 --> 17:25.959
Oh, no. Oh, no, Frank.
Todd went to Africa to save me.

17:25.959 --> 17:27.458
But you're not in Afri--

17:27.458 --> 17:29.542
You see the needles,
then you can judge.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.291
Come on.

17:33.375 --> 17:36.458
Hurry, hurry. Just gotta try
to find some kind of itinerary,

17:36.458 --> 17:38.375
or some clue of where
he might have gone.

17:38.375 --> 17:39.750
Here, look through these.

17:39.750 --> 17:41.375
Oh, God, I will not forgive myself

17:41.375 --> 17:43.458
if something happens to him
and if he gets hurt.

17:43.458 --> 17:47.375
Yes, the odds of getting hurt in Africa
do go up if you actually go.

17:47.375 --> 17:49.375
All right, I chickened out. All right?

17:49.375 --> 17:52.917
Africa is a very scary place.
Come on, Todd.

17:52.917 --> 17:56.417
You're the only person on the planet who'd
go halfway around the world to save me,

17:56.417 --> 17:59.709
- and I was too self-involved to see it.
- Sam?

17:59.709 --> 18:02.041
Yeah. Oh, Todd.

18:02.041 --> 18:03.750
Oh, thank God.

18:03.750 --> 18:07.583
I didn't go to Africa. I lied.
I am so sorry.

18:07.583 --> 18:10.333
It meant so much to me that
you were gonna go there to rescue me,

18:10.333 --> 18:13.709
and I'm just so glad that I stopped you
before you went. Oh, God.

18:13.709 --> 18:14.959
I wasn't going to Africa.

18:15.583 --> 18:18.750
- Huh?
- And that's a goodbye for Frank.

18:18.750 --> 18:24.208
No. You hurried out because you had
to get shots before it was too late.

Shots of a playground with my camera.
I'm doing an ad for a shoe company.

18:30.417 --> 18:34.125
- You weren't going to Africa to save me?
- No.

18:34.125 --> 18:36.250
How could you not go to Africa
to save me?

18:36.250 --> 18:39.458
- Because you're not there.
- Yeah, but as far as you know, I am.

18:39.458 --> 18:42.834
I mean, I'm there right now.
And where are you?

18:42.834 --> 18:45.583
- You know, you're not there.
- Neither are you.

18:45.583 --> 18:49.166
- But I was going to go.
- But you didn't go.

18:49.166 --> 18:51.834
- Yeah, but how would you know that?
- Because I know you.

18:51.834 --> 18:54.917
- No. No, you do not know me.
- You didn't go, did you?

18:54.917 --> 18:57.667
- Yeah, but I was going to go.
- But you didn't.

18:57.667 --> 18:59.166
And I don't care.

18:59.166 --> 19:02.125
Isn't that what you want?
A guy who sees you for who you are?

19:02.125 --> 19:04.625
No. No, I know who I am.

19:04.625 --> 19:08.667
I need someone who thinks
that I'm better than I know that I am.

19:09.083 --> 19:10.375
I'm sorry?

19:10.375 --> 19:13.542
Oh, damn it. You know, fine.

19:13.542 --> 19:16.250
Fine. I'm just gonna be
a better person, all right?

19:16.250 --> 19:18.083
Will that get everyone off my ass?

19:18.083 --> 19:21.875
No more taking the easy way out.
I'm going to do things the hard way.

19:21.875 --> 19:24.834
- You're going to Africa?
- No, I am kicking you out.

19:24.834 --> 19:27.750
- What?
- And that is very hard for me to do.

19:27.750 --> 19:29.083
But change begins at home.

19:29.792 --> 19:32.458
But don't hurry or anything,
you can stay here for a week or so.

19:34.208 --> 19:35.792
So do you not wanna date?

19:35.792 --> 19:39.834
Todd, no.
Don't you see what this is about?

19:39.834 --> 19:42.667
I never see what this is about.

19:43.208 --> 19:46.625

<i>a buffalo at all, it's a bison.</i>

19:55.291 --> 19:58.041

19:58.041 --> 20:01.208

20:14.709 --> 20:17.000
Look, I'm sorry I lied to you.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.500
You know, and you're right.
I'm not the person that I wanna be.

20:20.500 --> 20:23.625
But you know what?
I'm not the person that I was, either.

20:23.625 --> 20:25.208
And that girl that I used to be,

20:25.208 --> 20:28.709
she wouldn't have even thought
about going to Africa, you know?

20:28.709 --> 20:30.375
So I'm trying to change.

20:30.375 --> 20:32.458
I'm like those rockets.
Those early rockets.

20:32.458 --> 20:35.834
Who, you know, they tried,
and sometimes they failed.

20:35.834 --> 20:37.709
But they had progress.

20:37.709 --> 20:40.417
Samantha, you did go to Africa.

20:40.417 --> 20:44.166
- What? No.
- Yes. And you wanna know how I know?

20:44.166 --> 20:46.166
Because tomorrow,
the <i>Action News </i>is coming here

20:46.166 --> 20:48.500
to interview the mother of the girl
who went to Africa.

20:48.500 --> 20:50.917
Now, why would they do that
if you never went?

20:50.917 --> 20:53.375
Now, if you want dinner, go wash up.

I'm sorry, Dad.

- Mad?

you were moving back in.
