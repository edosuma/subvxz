WEBVTT

00:05.839 --> 00:07.173
Good morning, Mr. Sims.

00:08.008 --> 00:09.801
I want you to wear these in court.

00:10.510 --> 00:12.053
I also want you to shave.

00:12.804 --> 00:14.514
This all you got for my defense?

00:15.140 --> 00:16.891
We're still trying for a plea.

00:16.975 --> 00:18.101
A plea?

00:18.184 --> 00:21.604
Ain't gonna be no plea,
unless I roll on Canetti.

00:21.688 --> 00:24.315
If I do that,
then you can bury me in these.

00:24.816 --> 00:27.485
I ain't got a chance, lady,
and you know it.

00:27.569 --> 00:29.446
I want you to look good
for the jury, Arthur.

00:29.529 --> 00:32.157
Your appearance should suggest bank clerk,

00:32.240 --> 00:33.533
not heroin purchaser.

00:33.616 --> 00:35.994
And whether you believe it or not,
act confident.

00:37.996 --> 00:40.165
The shoes don't even fit.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.250
JABLONSKI: Item seven:

00:42.333 --> 00:46.129
the trial of Arthur Sims
and Anthony Canetti begins this A.M.

00:46.212 --> 00:48.381
Arresting officers Coffey
and Sergeant Bates

00:48.465 --> 00:49.966
are on court alert.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.426
Item eight:

00:51.509 --> 00:53.928
the Cleansing Fire,
which is a self-styled coven

00:54.012 --> 00:56.139
of your basic fascist, Nazi types,

00:56.222 --> 00:58.558
plans a march
through the north end this A.M.,

00:58.641 --> 01:00.435
ending up on Browning Street,

01:00.518 --> 01:02.520
on account of
that's where the birthplace is

01:02.604 --> 01:04.898
of this loony who founded them.

01:04.981 --> 01:08.234
It's gonna be the unveiling of a bust
of this Albrighton character,

01:08.318 --> 01:10.278
and we can expect a group
of about 15 or 20.

01:10.361 --> 01:13.031
Now, on account of the fact
that we don't want Browning Street

01:13.114 --> 01:14.991
burned down in a riot,

01:15.075 --> 01:17.368
we're gonna assign
heavy police protection.

01:17.452 --> 01:20.747
Billings, Kazman, Vicenza,
Martin, Kennedy, Ortez,

01:20.830 --> 01:22.040
you're on it.

01:22.123 --> 01:24.417
Lieutenant Goldblume coordinating.

01:24.501 --> 01:27.670
Item nine: responding to information
from a disgruntled loser,

01:27.754 --> 01:30.006
Detective Belker works an undercover today

01:30.090 --> 01:33.593
in the phone room
behind Myron's 128th Street Liquors.

01:33.676 --> 01:38.515
Item 10: this is a memo
from Deputy Commander Swanson

01:38.598 --> 01:41.142
to the effect that, uh... (chuckles)

01:41.226 --> 01:46.272
we got a shot at the first
monthly decrease in crime citywide

01:46.356 --> 01:49.567
-in the last 22 months.
-(cheering, clapping)

01:49.651 --> 01:53.196
The note, here is, "Congrats! Keep it up!

01:53.279 --> 01:55.615
-MAN: Alright!
-"At least till the end of the month."

01:55.698 --> 01:58.618
-(laughter)
-(indistinct chattering)

01:58.701 --> 02:01.913
Item 11: look, during the last two days,

02:01.996 --> 02:05.375
kids from St. Thaddeus Parish
have been collecting cans

02:05.458 --> 02:06.584
so that they can go to camp.

02:06.668 --> 02:08.670
They've been getting a lot
of flak from the bums,

02:08.753 --> 02:10.630
the winos over on Duke Street.

02:11.297 --> 02:15.635
St. Thaddeus happens to be my parish,
and well, if those patrolling the area

02:15.718 --> 02:19.013
just keep your eye out for incidents,
I'd appreciate it.

02:19.097 --> 02:21.808
Okay, that's it.
That's the last item. Let's roll.

02:21.891 --> 02:25.353
Oh, um, while you're leaving,

02:25.436 --> 02:27.897
just one thing I want to remind you of.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.649
Maybe some of you don't know it,

02:29.732 --> 02:32.819
but victims' aid's been running
a skeleton crew downtown

02:32.902 --> 02:34.821
on voluntary contributions.

02:34.904 --> 02:37.198
Um, Mrs. Furillo has asked me
to remind you

02:37.282 --> 02:40.243
that a collection box has been
set up by the main entrance.

02:40.326 --> 02:43.538
It's completely up to the individual.
Okay, let's go. That's it.

02:43.621 --> 02:45.790
(indistinct chattering)

02:45.874 --> 02:47.709
Goldblume! It never fails.

02:47.792 --> 02:49.335
Can you direct us to this Goldblume?

02:49.419 --> 02:52.881
You got him.
You guys with the Cleansing Fire?

02:52.964 --> 02:55.133
-That's correct.
-This the Cleansing Fire, Henry?

02:55.216 --> 02:57.844
-Ooh, hi. Looking big.
-(laughs) Hi, guys!

02:57.927 --> 03:00.388
You got permits that will cover
your intended activities?

03:00.471 --> 03:02.557
-Of course.
-This doesn't give your exact route.

03:02.640 --> 03:04.058
Which way
do you intend turning on Madison?

03:04.142 --> 03:06.352
Right, obviously.
Harmon Albrighton's birthplace

03:06.436 --> 03:08.730
-is on Browning.
-It's too crowded during midday traffic.

03:08.813 --> 03:10.648
You're gonna have to go
left to Exposition,

03:10.732 --> 03:13.151
-then you can cut across to Browning.
-We did not come here

03:13.234 --> 03:16.154
-to march up and down alleys.
-Look, it must be obvious

03:16.237 --> 03:18.489
you're not gonna be welcome
in this minority neighborhood.

03:18.573 --> 03:20.909
Since I'm responsible for your safety,
I pick the route,

03:20.992 --> 03:22.827
unless you'd care to call it off.

03:22.911 --> 03:24.746
You'd like that, wouldn't you, Goldblume?

03:24.829 --> 03:27.540
What I would like, Mr. Edsel,

03:27.624 --> 03:29.751
is to get through today without incident.

03:29.834 --> 03:31.753
You march, make your speech, that's it.

03:31.836 --> 03:33.630
-Understood?
-We have no desire to stir up

03:33.713 --> 03:35.924
or incite the street rabble,
if that's what you mean.

03:36.007 --> 03:38.259
We convene at 10:30 at the parade route.

03:38.343 --> 03:39.385
Agreed.

03:40.094 --> 03:43.097
(indistinct conversations)

03:45.516 --> 03:46.601
You know, sir,

03:46.684 --> 03:48.937
theirs is a higher grade
of cotton than ours.

03:54.525 --> 03:57.028
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

03:57.111 --> 03:59.197
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

03:59.280 --> 04:02.909
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:10.124 --> 04:13.544
(theme music playing)

05:11.352 --> 05:13.896
DISPATCHER: <i>Robbery in progress.</i>
<i>Catchmeer's Pharmacy,</i>

05:13.980 --> 05:15.857
<i>corner of Garrison and Liberty Heights,</i>

05:15.940 --> 05:19.485
<i>male suspect,</i>
<i>no further description, believed armed.</i>

05:19.569 --> 05:23.573
-(upbeat music playing)
-(sirens wailing)

05:32.040 --> 05:32.957
(tires screech)

05:33.041 --> 05:35.460
RENKO: What the hell is going on
this A.M.?

05:35.543 --> 05:37.628
All these skels out here
robbing each other

05:37.712 --> 05:40.715
-like there ain't no tomorrow.
-He just took off. He went up the alley.

05:40.798 --> 05:41.799
Yes, sir.

05:42.592 --> 05:43.593
Yes, sir.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.276
(man grunting)

06:04.906 --> 06:06.991
Hold it right there! Drop it!

06:08.242 --> 06:09.369
Stay back!

06:10.578 --> 06:12.246
-Let me fix!
-(shouts)

06:14.290 --> 06:17.460
Let me drink!
Will you let me drink it, man?

06:18.544 --> 06:20.880
-(grunts)
-(panting)

06:20.963 --> 06:22.590
There's nothing on the streets.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.594
I'm dying. Please help me.

06:26.677 --> 06:28.679
-Get him up.
-Help me, please?

06:28.763 --> 06:30.515
-RENKO: Get his man up.
-MAN: Please, help me.

06:30.598 --> 06:33.559
-Man, look, it's a victimless crime!
-What in the hell

06:33.643 --> 06:36.229
is going on around here?
Would you come and sit down here, boy?

06:36.312 --> 06:38.398
-I need a fix, man.
-Sit him in this chair, Renko.

06:38.481 --> 06:40.566
Come sit down here
before I knock your head off.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.527
-Sit down here.
-(man sits heavily on chair)

06:42.610 --> 06:45.488
Captain, we're up 300%
on robberies and burgs

06:45.571 --> 06:47.573
-and double on assaults.
-Drug panic?

06:47.657 --> 06:49.283
Somebody must have missed a shipment.

06:49.367 --> 06:51.577
-Get me Briscoe, would you, Stan?
-Right, Captain.

06:54.831 --> 06:57.375
How you doing, darling?
Bobby Hill in today?

06:57.458 --> 07:00.711
Would you be gracious enough to tell him
that his daddy would like to see him?

07:02.880 --> 07:06.300
-RENKO: Van, Vann, Valdez, Weissman--
-Officer, your daddy's here.

07:07.427 --> 07:10.430
-I have nothing to say to him.
-Just go and talk to him, pal.

07:10.513 --> 07:12.598
Don't put her in the middle of this, okay?

07:12.682 --> 07:14.183
-Officer?
-Okay?

07:16.394 --> 07:19.230
-All right, thanks.
-(Renko speaks indistinctly)

07:19.313 --> 07:21.065
Would you tell the inspector, please,

07:21.149 --> 07:23.734
I'll need overline authorizations
on overtime?

07:23.818 --> 07:24.694
Mm-hmm.

07:24.777 --> 07:28.531
Four units 4:00 to 12:00,
four units midnights,

07:28.614 --> 07:32.910
and if we could get forthwith assistance
from the Ferry or Farmingdale.

07:33.494 --> 07:35.997
Mm-hmm. Yeah, right. Thanks.

07:38.082 --> 07:39.584
Captain?

07:39.667 --> 07:41.085
Counselor.

07:41.169 --> 07:43.546
I thought you were on trial
with Sims and Canetti.

07:43.629 --> 07:45.047
Break in jury selection.

07:45.131 --> 07:48.801
Frank, you people are wasting
$40,000 of the state's dollars.

07:48.885 --> 07:49.969
Why is that?

07:50.052 --> 07:52.096
Isn't that what a felony trial costs?

07:52.180 --> 07:55.475
"People vs. Arthur Sims,"
who unfortunately bought his smack one day

07:55.558 --> 07:56.934
from a drug kingpin?

07:57.018 --> 07:59.020
Will your client testify against Canetti?

07:59.103 --> 08:01.606
-No, he can't.
-Then no deals.

08:01.689 --> 08:03.441
You're pretty high and mighty on this one.

08:03.524 --> 08:06.360
I've got a client with a one-page sheet
who's willing to plead and do a year

08:06.444 --> 08:08.112
and you're acting like
he's John Dillinger.

08:08.196 --> 08:10.364
He wasn't purchasing
for personal consumption.

08:10.448 --> 08:12.200
-That was resale weight.
-Come on, Frank.

08:12.283 --> 08:14.577
You don't give a damn
what Arthur Sims did.

08:14.660 --> 08:17.830
You're just afraid you'll lose Canetti
if you plead the guy he sold to.

08:17.914 --> 08:18.873
That's not a crime.

08:18.956 --> 08:21.375
No, it's just damn unfair.

08:24.504 --> 08:28.466
So I started having these spells,
and I got so tired, I could hardly move.

08:28.549 --> 08:31.469
Now, you know, as stubborn as I am,
I don't want to go and see no doctor,

08:31.552 --> 08:34.055
but your Aunt Feeny insisted.

08:35.097 --> 08:37.308
Ain't no easy way to say this, Bobby.

08:37.934 --> 08:39.143
Doc says I'm dying.

08:42.230 --> 08:43.773
How long have you known?

08:43.856 --> 08:44.899
A month or so.

08:46.108 --> 08:48.569
Well, why didn't you call me?
I would have come down.

08:48.653 --> 08:50.404
I'm ailing. I ain't dead.

08:50.488 --> 08:52.240
And besides,
the way we left it last time--

08:52.323 --> 08:54.116
I would have come down.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.661
Bobby, I know how hard
they're working you.

08:58.204 --> 09:01.832
Look, um, you know,
I don't have much room in my place, but--

09:01.916 --> 09:03.501
I didn't come here to be no bother.

09:03.584 --> 09:05.294
I checked in at the Cumberland.

09:05.378 --> 09:08.548
But I want you to know before I left home,
I settled with your Aunt Feeny.

09:08.631 --> 09:13.261
I paid her every cent
of that $400 that I owed her.

09:13.344 --> 09:16.931
But the hotel wants $100 advance.

09:19.225 --> 09:21.018
And you want me to loan you the money.

09:21.102 --> 09:22.937
On account of things a little tight now.

09:23.020 --> 09:24.355
You know how I hate asking you.

09:24.438 --> 09:25.773
Who's your doctor, Reggie?

09:25.856 --> 09:28.609
Now don't go bothering the man.

09:28.693 --> 09:31.445
-What's your doctor's name?
-I went to this clinic.

09:31.529 --> 09:35.408
There must have been four or five doctors,
all kind of people staring down at me.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.661
Have no time for me to get nobody's name.

09:38.744 --> 09:40.538
Is it the Edge Hill Clinic?

09:41.747 --> 09:43.958
Yeah, that's it,
but they ain't gonna tell you no more

09:44.041 --> 09:47.044
than I done already told you,
Bobby, it's my <i>heart</i>

09:47.128 --> 09:48.796
and it ain't gonna last long now.

09:50.172 --> 09:53.050
I got to get to work.
I'll call you later at the Cumberland.

09:53.134 --> 09:56.512
Listen, Bobby, now I know
how busy you've been.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.140
I was just hoping that we
could spend a little time.

09:59.223 --> 10:03.394
See, we never did take the time
just to be together

10:03.477 --> 10:05.563
and just to talk.

10:18.034 --> 10:19.827
COFFEY: We're on regular motor patrol.

10:19.910 --> 10:23.414
At about 10:45, I saw
defendant Canetti's Cadillac Seville

10:23.497 --> 10:25.833
-illegally parked at a pump.
-Pump?

10:25.916 --> 10:27.668
Hydrant! Hydrant.

10:27.752 --> 10:30.880
Um... as we approached the car,
I was looking through the window,

10:30.963 --> 10:33.049
and I saw money change hands

10:33.132 --> 10:35.092
from defendant Sims to old man Canetti,

10:35.176 --> 10:38.471
and then white powder from
defendant Canetti to Sims.

10:38.554 --> 10:41.515
Good. Good.
They're still picking the jury.

10:41.599 --> 10:44.101
Yeah, I don't think it should
take much longer.

10:44.185 --> 10:47.271
Uh, Tony, I'll see you in the courtroom?

10:49.774 --> 10:51.651
Excuse me, Captain. Channing O'Dwyer.

10:51.734 --> 10:52.943
I represent Tony Canetti.

10:53.027 --> 10:55.529
This is one of his associates,
Charles Corso.

10:55.613 --> 10:57.531
-What is it?
-Uh?

11:00.034 --> 11:02.578
We feel a very hard position
is being taken

11:02.662 --> 11:03.829
against my client.

11:03.913 --> 11:05.164
What do we have here, Captain?

11:05.247 --> 11:06.832
We have a 62-year-old man,

11:06.916 --> 11:09.710
only two arrests in the past 30 years.

11:09.794 --> 11:11.128
He's wielded a great influence

11:11.212 --> 11:12.713
-in his community.
-Hmm,

11:12.797 --> 11:14.965
as the prime purveyor of hard drugs

11:15.049 --> 11:17.301
from 117th Street to 124th.

11:17.385 --> 11:20.388
If he's such a prime purveyor,
what's he dealing half an ounce for?

11:20.471 --> 11:24.392
That's a whole other question concerning
Mr. Canetti's possible senility.

11:24.475 --> 11:27.728
Now, may I ask you a very private
and confidential question, Captain?

11:27.812 --> 11:28.854
You can ask.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.982
Are you having difficulties
on your streets?

11:33.234 --> 11:34.151
What do you mean?

11:34.235 --> 11:36.404
I hear the rumor
the streets are all dried up,

11:36.487 --> 11:38.322
that there's a heroin panic going on.

11:38.406 --> 11:39.990
I thought that you'd be the man to ask.

11:40.074 --> 11:42.660
Are you suggesting Canetti's
cut off the drug supply?

11:42.743 --> 11:45.413
Mr. Canetti involved with drugs? No way.

11:45.496 --> 11:47.456
Tony Canetti wants federal correction.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.874
Is that too much to ask?

11:49.625 --> 11:51.669
He'll cop to an "E" sale.
That's 24 months.

11:51.752 --> 11:53.796
-And he'd like to do it in Danbury.
-I repeat.

11:53.879 --> 11:56.090
Are you telling me Canetti's
cut off the drug supply?

11:56.173 --> 11:57.258
All I'm saying, Captain,

11:57.341 --> 11:59.677
is that he's very
influential in his community.

11:59.760 --> 12:03.305
Mr. O'Dwyer, Mr. Corso,

12:03.389 --> 12:06.100
I'm taking what you're telling me
as blackmail.

12:06.183 --> 12:09.520
And that means there's no chance
Tony Canetti gets a deal.

12:10.104 --> 12:11.105
None.

12:21.365 --> 12:24.452
-Lillia Montro, ninth at Hialeah. Got it.
-(man speaking indistinctly)

12:24.535 --> 12:27.830
And Blushful Bride, also ninth at Hialeah.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.915
To win? Yeah, I got it. Okay.

12:30.833 --> 12:34.879
BELKER: Fourth race, won't worry,
I got it. Honest, I got it all down.

12:34.962 --> 12:36.172
-How you doing, kid?
-Huh?

12:36.255 --> 12:38.799
-You developing a taste for this?
-Yeah, I think I am.

12:38.883 --> 12:41.010
How about I give you a little pop quiz?

12:41.093 --> 12:43.471
Suppose we're raided. The cops come in.

12:43.554 --> 12:44.805
What do you do?

12:44.889 --> 12:46.348
I get arrested.

12:46.432 --> 12:47.558
Before that!

12:47.641 --> 12:49.685
What do you do with all these slips, huh?

12:50.561 --> 12:51.645
You eat them, right?

12:51.729 --> 12:52.855
Of course!

12:52.938 --> 12:53.939
You eat these,

12:54.023 --> 12:56.859
and you're gonna be eating
chemically processed paper,

12:56.942 --> 12:58.819
filled with poison.

12:58.903 --> 13:00.321
Now I'm gonna show you something.

13:00.404 --> 13:03.616
From now on, you use these.

13:05.242 --> 13:07.578
Rice paper from Chinatown.

13:07.661 --> 13:10.456
No preservatives, organically pure.

13:10.539 --> 13:13.334
Look, I take care of my people.

13:13.417 --> 13:14.752
Now you get rid of these.

13:16.086 --> 13:17.922
Hey, Myron, the Nazis are coming.

13:18.005 --> 13:20.174
What? I thought they weren't gonna.

13:20.257 --> 13:22.426
The newspaper said that
they wouldn't get a permit.

13:22.510 --> 13:25.095
It just came on the radio.
They're marching down Cumberland,

13:25.179 --> 13:27.765
and they're gonna be demonstrating
over on Browning street.

13:27.848 --> 13:29.391
Yeah? Not a chance.

13:29.475 --> 13:32.728
Nazis are not gonna come
parading around here in my neighborhood.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.730
I think I'm going over there on my lunch.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.941
I think we're gonna
go over to Diparma's Grocery

13:37.024 --> 13:38.859
and ask him for fruit and vegetables

13:38.943 --> 13:41.278
and for whatever he's
got there that's rotten.

13:41.362 --> 13:43.489
Called the Edge Hill
and every other clinic in Roanoke,

13:43.572 --> 13:45.282
and there were no records
of a Reginald Hill.

13:45.366 --> 13:47.117
I even checked with Medicare.
There was nothing.

13:47.201 --> 13:50.579
Well, I don't mean to stick
my beak into it, partner,

13:50.663 --> 13:53.040
but I think you're walking
into a major mistake.

13:53.123 --> 13:54.041
Mistake?

13:54.124 --> 13:56.585
Renko, the man has lied to me
about his own death.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.755
(laughs) Don't you think
you ought to confront him,

13:59.839 --> 14:01.090
maybe talk to him about it?

14:01.173 --> 14:03.592
He'll just say he's sorry
and act real meek,

14:03.676 --> 14:06.887
maybe get his eyes all watered
up to make me feel guilty,

14:06.971 --> 14:08.889
and then he'll hit me up
for some more money.

14:08.973 --> 14:10.724
Hey, you guys ain't got time to eat that.

14:10.808 --> 14:12.393
-What?
-You're needed on the street.

14:12.476 --> 14:14.395
The PBA guarantees me a hot meal.

14:14.478 --> 14:16.397
We done our part.
Read him the count, partner.

14:16.480 --> 14:18.315
Seven robberies and assault before noon.

14:18.399 --> 14:19.692
Tip of the iceberg.

14:19.775 --> 14:22.820
Price of smack's up 500%,
that's if you can even find the stuff.

14:22.903 --> 14:26.532
We just pulled a kid out of a dumpster,
shot up Epsom Salts.

14:26.615 --> 14:28.784
MAN: Bus table 19, please.

14:32.204 --> 14:34.915
How long you think your heart
can keep pumping that sludge?

14:34.999 --> 14:38.210
Oh, it just so happens
that Margo's special meatloaf

14:38.294 --> 14:40.921
is an oasis of culinary pleasure

14:41.005 --> 14:44.383
in these otherwise
desiccated surroundings.

14:44.466 --> 14:45.968
Don't you care about your body?

14:47.011 --> 14:50.598
Well, at the risk
of a dreadful macho cliché,

14:50.681 --> 14:54.852
I invite you to strike the walls
of my lateral abdominals.

14:54.935 --> 14:56.645
(scoffs) That means nothing.

14:58.105 --> 15:00.482
-It's what's inside that counts.
-(chuckles)

15:00.566 --> 15:02.443
All right, I know,
maybe I'm a little soft,

15:02.526 --> 15:03.986
but my tubes are clean.

15:04.069 --> 15:06.155
You know, a man gets to be your age,

15:06.238 --> 15:08.115
you better start eating defensively.

15:08.198 --> 15:10.284
Or one day, a chunk of that meatloaf there

15:10.367 --> 15:12.077
is gonna get stuck in your plumbing.

15:12.161 --> 15:13.203
You vapor lock,

15:13.287 --> 15:16.206
we're all in our dress uniforms
when they fire the salute.

15:21.962 --> 15:24.006
Oh, the hell with it. Mmm! (sighs)

15:27.217 --> 15:28.636
All right. What do you got, Sid?

15:30.596 --> 15:34.183
Corso's doing it out of loyalty
to old man Canetti.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.602
Keep pressure on the D.A. to plead him.

15:36.685 --> 15:38.437
I'm touched, but I ain't buying.

15:38.520 --> 15:41.815
Hey, the man knows without smack,
you guys can't keep a lid on things.

15:41.899 --> 15:44.818
Oh, come on!
The stuff's scarce for 48 hours,

15:44.902 --> 15:47.071
five or six greedy players
shoot each other up,

15:47.154 --> 15:48.489
and Canetti's history.

15:48.572 --> 15:52.493
Less than 48 hours.
There's some grief coming, Norm.

15:52.576 --> 15:53.827
From who?

15:53.911 --> 15:55.579
From a discontented party.

15:55.663 --> 15:58.248
First, me and you got to talk expenses.

15:58.332 --> 16:00.793
Would you, uh, step into my boudoir?

16:00.876 --> 16:02.753
(laughs)

16:02.836 --> 16:03.837
Sharp.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.886
Norman, I need 300 beans.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.680
Whoa, I don't believe you, Sid.

16:12.763 --> 16:15.683
Hey, look, I'm paying dependents
out of my own pocket.

16:16.308 --> 16:17.685
Come on, at least make it a deuce.

16:17.768 --> 16:20.562
-I lose, but I can live with it.
-Yeah, here, try this.

16:20.646 --> 16:24.233
50 bucks? Oh, boy, you sure I'm worth it?

16:24.316 --> 16:25.859
(honks horn)

16:25.943 --> 16:27.194
The lady wasn't wrong.

16:27.277 --> 16:30.990
R-E-S-P-E-C-T, find out
what it means to <i>me, </i>Norman.

16:31.073 --> 16:32.366
Plus, I don't bust your parole

16:32.449 --> 16:34.451
for a certain torch job
I heard about last week.

16:34.535 --> 16:35.869
All right? End of discussion.

16:35.953 --> 16:37.871
What kind of defamation is this?
Torch job.

16:37.955 --> 16:39.999
Come on, Sid!
I've been keeping a ledger on you.

16:40.082 --> 16:41.709
You torched a jewelry store.

16:41.792 --> 16:44.420
And how'd you get these wheels? Huh?
In fact, give me this, huh?

16:44.503 --> 16:46.380
-Pull out. You're going in.
-Oh, no. Come on.

16:46.463 --> 16:48.465
You got something
to work off here, sweetheart,

16:48.549 --> 16:50.884
or you're back in the joint
keeping house for King Kong.

16:50.968 --> 16:52.886
Let's go pick out
an apron for you, come on.

16:52.970 --> 16:54.221
No, no no. All right, look.

16:54.304 --> 16:57.516
I was wrong about your generosity spirit.

16:57.599 --> 16:58.892
My mistake, okay?

16:59.560 --> 17:02.062
(sighs) All right, let's hear something.

17:04.064 --> 17:06.483
There's a second lieutenant
of Canetti's in the picture.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.694
-Who?
-Bobby Stellini.

17:09.403 --> 17:11.530
I know him from my old soda days.

17:11.613 --> 17:13.574
This individual's writing the book,

17:13.657 --> 17:17.161
"The World as I See it Through My Nose."
But he's still pretty connected.

17:17.244 --> 17:19.872
I don't know,
he's ticked off at Corso or something.

17:19.955 --> 17:21.790
He's thinking maybe this is his shot.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.000
To ace Fat Chuck?

17:23.083 --> 17:25.085
Nothing's happening on the streets.

17:25.169 --> 17:27.171
Think about what's piling up somewhere.

17:28.505 --> 17:32.426
Norman, the natural order
has been disrupted.

17:35.012 --> 17:36.722
Now stay with me, come on, up here.

17:36.805 --> 17:39.349
And don't touch anything,
all right? Here we go.

17:40.350 --> 17:42.603
I'm here to see
Sergeant Stanley Jablonski.

17:42.686 --> 17:45.314
-What's going on around here today, girl?
-We can't process.

17:45.397 --> 17:47.483
Not until the bus
takes this load to midtown.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.652
Father, what are you doing here?

17:50.736 --> 17:54.740
-What are these, your bodyguards?
-Stanley, we got to take action!

17:54.823 --> 17:56.075
It's this guy we contracted

17:56.158 --> 17:57.910
-to buy up the aluminum cans.
-Yeah?

17:57.993 --> 18:00.996
-Sleazeball's cheating our kids.
-Tell him about the dog, Father.

18:01.080 --> 18:05.125
-What's he doing?
-He's claiming 15 cans to the pound.

18:05.209 --> 18:08.295
Imagine that kind of lowlife tube steak
doing a thing like that?

18:08.378 --> 18:11.465
On a project we've all worked so hard on,
you, me, the kids.

18:11.548 --> 18:13.717
We weighed them, 10 to 12 cans in a pound.

18:13.801 --> 18:15.719
-You know how hard it is to find the guy.
-Yeah.

18:15.803 --> 18:18.263
-Now he's exploiting the situation.
-It's just a question

18:18.347 --> 18:20.099
of how many cans in a pound?

18:20.182 --> 18:22.226
Can't you make some kind of compromise?

18:22.309 --> 18:25.938
The man's entirely unreasonable.
He says our kids are cheating him.

18:26.021 --> 18:27.439
Says he can pay them what he wants.

18:27.523 --> 18:29.399
Then he ducks in his shack
and locks the door.

18:29.483 --> 18:31.318
Tell him about the dog.

18:31.401 --> 18:34.530
FATHER: Oh, yeah. He sicced
his police dog on me.

18:34.613 --> 18:36.198
I don't know what to tell you, Father.

18:36.281 --> 18:38.826
It's not exactly some kind of
heavy crime's been committed here.

18:38.909 --> 18:40.911
Oh, come on, Stanley!

18:40.994 --> 18:42.579
Larceny by fraud?

18:43.288 --> 18:44.581
Canine assault?

18:44.665 --> 18:46.667
I've already talked to a cop about it.

18:47.334 --> 18:49.044
Said it wasn't worth his time.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.170
Who told you that?

18:51.088 --> 18:54.049
I forget his name,
but believe me, I wouldn't be down here

18:54.133 --> 18:56.009
if you weren't our last resort.

18:56.093 --> 18:57.177
Can we count on you?

18:58.220 --> 19:00.931
Okay, okay, I'll send somebody out.

19:01.014 --> 19:03.642
Uh, Daugherty, Kirby.

19:03.725 --> 19:06.395
What's this guy's name?
Where can we find him?

19:06.478 --> 19:07.896
Bum's name is Glynn.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.607
Two hours have passed.
We've had 18 more robberies.

19:10.691 --> 19:13.068
I'm trying to protect
a fascist march and demonstration

19:13.152 --> 19:14.236
with six men,

19:14.319 --> 19:16.738
and you people don't have
the courtesy to return my calls.

19:18.699 --> 19:20.534
-Please do. Thank you.
-(knocking)

19:21.618 --> 19:23.036
Corso's in interrogation.

19:28.959 --> 19:30.669
Now, what's the shot?

19:30.752 --> 19:32.754
My attorney's on trial with my colleague

19:32.838 --> 19:34.506
while you're pulling this end run.

19:36.133 --> 19:38.802
I want you on notice, Mr. Corso.

19:39.428 --> 19:41.597
Your statements to me
in court this morning

19:41.680 --> 19:44.975
came that close to making
a conspiracy case against you.

19:45.058 --> 19:47.394
Oh, yeah? Conspiracy to what?

19:48.061 --> 19:52.065
-Obey the law?
-Obstruct justice, distribute narcotics.

19:52.149 --> 19:55.235
Captain, you got a case, you bust me.
Otherwise, I don't scare.

19:55.319 --> 19:56.987
I know what cop houses look like.

19:57.070 --> 19:59.072
I don't scare either, Mr. Corso.

19:59.156 --> 20:00.866
Then why do I get this feeling

20:01.617 --> 20:04.745
that you're squeezing my stones
to get me to unplug the tap?

20:05.829 --> 20:09.666
Well, you're a cop.
You're supposed to be congratulating me,

20:09.750 --> 20:12.044
give me one of those
drug-prevention awards.

20:12.127 --> 20:14.004
-It won't work, Chuck.
-Why? What's that?

20:14.087 --> 20:15.339
You can't afford it.

20:16.131 --> 20:19.009
Right now, people are planning
moves on Canetti's territory.

20:19.092 --> 20:22.346
Oh, gee. (scoffs)
Like that's something new.

20:23.805 --> 20:25.015
They ain't got the product.

20:25.098 --> 20:26.892
They'll go after the product,

20:26.975 --> 20:28.435
and I'll be cleaning up a drug war.

20:28.518 --> 20:31.230
Hey, look, now I agree

20:31.313 --> 20:34.942
that we got a common interest
in keeping the peace.

20:35.025 --> 20:36.485
So lighten up on the old man.

20:37.110 --> 20:39.238
Let him do his time
in federal with his pals,

20:39.321 --> 20:41.281
and let's put things back to normal.

20:42.157 --> 20:43.367
Let him go, Henry.

20:45.661 --> 20:46.787
What is it!?

20:46.870 --> 20:49.122
You ain't getting your picture
in the paper enough?

20:49.206 --> 20:51.917
Now you're the guy that denies
a 62-year-old diabetic

20:52.000 --> 20:53.794
the right to do his bid among friends?

21:03.053 --> 21:04.096
Captain.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.098
How's the trial going?

21:06.181 --> 21:07.891
Typical. It's bogged down.

21:07.975 --> 21:09.977
This was a good bust Lucy and I made.

21:10.060 --> 21:11.228
I know that.

21:12.271 --> 21:15.232
This is just one guy's opinion,
but when a cop does make

21:15.315 --> 21:18.443
a good bust of a heavy guy,
I just hope you back us up on it.

21:18.527 --> 21:20.612
They talking about
a plea bargain downtown?

21:20.696 --> 21:23.031
There's a lot of rumors,
mostly from O'Dwyer.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.701
It's not happening, not on Tony Canetti.

21:26.451 --> 21:27.911
Thanks, I'm glad to hear that.

21:31.456 --> 21:34.084
Lieutenant, got a call on a situation

21:34.167 --> 21:36.628
at the Martin Luther King
Emergency Facility.

21:36.712 --> 21:38.422
Armed assailants in the treatment room.

21:38.505 --> 21:41.341
Sector-B units and units
from the Heights are on the scene.

21:44.261 --> 21:45.262
Captain.

21:46.305 --> 21:49.391
Listen, I got a snitch says
Canetti's second lieutenant,

21:49.474 --> 21:51.351
a guy named Stellini, is planning a move.

21:51.435 --> 21:52.394
What kind of move?

21:52.477 --> 21:54.688
He don't know exactly,
but figure on Corso.

21:54.771 --> 21:55.814
Bring him in.

21:58.525 --> 22:02.029
-(siren wailing)
-MAN: Keep the crowd back.

22:02.112 --> 22:03.822
(tires screech)

22:06.950 --> 22:08.827
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

22:17.044 --> 22:20.130
Lieutenant Hunter, I'm in charge here.
You have anyone injured in there?

22:20.213 --> 22:22.341
No. No, they let us go
as soon as they got the drugs.

22:22.424 --> 22:24.551
Do you have any personnel
or patients that are remaining in there?

22:24.634 --> 22:25.635
No, just those boys.

22:27.971 --> 22:29.389
Those assailants are juveniles?

22:29.473 --> 22:31.975
Kids! They're desperate.
You better try and get to them.

22:32.059 --> 22:33.685
They're injecting straight Demerol.

22:33.769 --> 22:35.187
They won't be alive much longer.

22:37.773 --> 22:39.149
YOUNG MAN: I'm not armed!

22:39.232 --> 22:40.484
Don't shoot me!

22:40.567 --> 22:44.780
Please don't shoot! Don't hurt me!

22:44.863 --> 22:46.323
Don't hurt me!

22:52.120 --> 22:53.288
I think he's dead.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.082
Get a doctor! This guy's dying!

22:55.165 --> 22:57.584
MAN: Clear out!

22:57.667 --> 22:59.961
YOUNG MAN: Hey, let go of me! Turn loose!

23:00.045 --> 23:02.631
(shouting)

23:02.714 --> 23:04.466
(siren wails)

23:04.549 --> 23:06.468
MAN: Move out. Come on, move them out!

23:11.223 --> 23:13.141
The vision of Harmon Albrighton

23:13.225 --> 23:15.811
lies deep within the breast of millions.

23:15.894 --> 23:19.356
And one day,
the world will bow down in fealty.

23:19.439 --> 23:21.525
Watch the old man.
Maybe you'll learn something.

23:21.608 --> 23:24.444
Myron, they want a confrontation.
We shouldn't give it to them now.

23:24.528 --> 23:27.489
-Will you listen to that filth?
-I know. Just don't do anything yet.

23:27.572 --> 23:29.908
-Hold off. Don't do anything now.
-Here, take a potato.

23:29.991 --> 23:31.493
Potatoes are too hard, Myron.

23:31.576 --> 23:33.703
All right, here, so take a muskmelon then.

23:33.787 --> 23:38.375
MAN: A man of diminished brain capacity
cannot make a single wise decision.

23:38.458 --> 23:42.087
Nor will an act of heroism
ever come from their ranks.

23:42.170 --> 23:44.172
(laughs) Love your hat, man!

23:44.256 --> 23:46.550
(shouting)

23:48.718 --> 23:51.972
Here's your proof, you...

23:54.891 --> 23:58.478
(all shouting)

24:00.647 --> 24:02.023
(sirens wail)

24:02.899 --> 24:05.152
-Mick, what are you doing?
-Don't blow my cover.

24:06.111 --> 24:08.321
All right, fellas, that's enough.
That's enough.

24:09.406 --> 24:10.991
(all shouting)

24:11.992 --> 24:13.034
(statue shattering)

24:13.827 --> 24:15.036
Let go of him!

24:18.415 --> 24:21.460
Captain? Assistant D.A. Bernstein.

24:24.087 --> 24:25.380
Who's putting pressure?

24:26.256 --> 24:27.841
No, no one's come through me.

24:29.217 --> 24:32.137
Look, if no weakness
in the case has developed,

24:32.220 --> 24:33.430
I say nail the sucker.

24:34.139 --> 24:36.725
Uh, hold it.
Briscoe's walking in the door.

24:36.808 --> 24:37.934
Call you back.

24:38.852 --> 24:40.937
-Captain?
-Inspector, my office.

24:43.982 --> 24:46.151
Sergeant, they're bringing in your guy.

24:46.234 --> 24:47.736
I want to talk to him.

24:49.362 --> 24:51.823
Bobby Stellini, possession
of controlled substance,

24:51.907 --> 24:53.325
to wit, cocaine.

24:56.703 --> 24:58.455
Who's in charge here? You?

24:58.538 --> 24:59.998
I'm Sergeant Jablonski.

25:00.081 --> 25:02.083
22 years, I buy scrap metal.

25:02.167 --> 25:04.211
Never a problem until this maniac priest--

25:04.294 --> 25:05.921
Watch the name-calling.

25:06.004 --> 25:07.797
Guy comes in yelling and screaming,

25:07.881 --> 25:09.216
terrifies my wife.

25:09.299 --> 25:11.718
He's a maniac. I don't care he's a priest.

25:11.801 --> 25:14.638
Father says you're undervaluing
the price of them cans.

25:14.721 --> 25:15.972
-Undervaluing?
-Yeah.

25:16.056 --> 25:18.308
Listen, mister. I'm showing you something.

25:18.391 --> 25:20.310
Here's how kids pick up cans.

25:21.603 --> 25:23.813
Always get dirt in them,
so they're heavier.

25:23.897 --> 25:26.149
So you're making a big production
out of a little dirt?

25:26.233 --> 25:27.817
Why should I pay for dirt?

25:27.901 --> 25:30.237
He says that you sicced your dog on him.

25:30.320 --> 25:32.072
Sure! He was trespassing.

25:32.155 --> 25:34.282
I tried explaining my pricing schedule.

25:34.366 --> 25:35.992
He's screaming and hollering.

25:36.701 --> 25:40.372
Did he tell you he stole
ten bucks out of my cash box?

25:41.289 --> 25:44.668
-Father stole money from you?
-What do you call it? I got witnesses.

25:44.751 --> 25:47.754
And believe me, I am counter-charging.

25:47.837 --> 25:50.048
-Let me think here a minute.
-What's to think about?

25:50.131 --> 25:52.676
-You busted me. Bust him.
-Look, I'm not gonna bust him.

25:52.759 --> 25:54.844
Oh, hell of a justice system.

25:54.928 --> 25:59.683
You bust an old scrap dealer.
You won't bust a priest.

25:59.766 --> 26:01.601
-WOMAN: What do we do with him?
-Hold him.

26:02.519 --> 26:06.189
-Let me settle this out here.
-FURILLO: What's going on, Warren?

26:07.023 --> 26:09.568
I've got a drug panic,
and I can't get a phone call returned.

26:09.651 --> 26:11.278
There's a school of thinking downtown

26:11.361 --> 26:14.531
that holds <i>you</i> responsible
for that panic, Captain.

26:14.614 --> 26:18.827
Oh? Is that why people
have been going behind my back

26:18.910 --> 26:21.288
to pressure the D.A. on Canetti?

26:21.371 --> 26:23.123
What happened to captain's prerogative?

26:23.206 --> 26:26.710
No one's questioning
your prerogative, Captain, <i>yet.</i>

26:26.793 --> 26:30.630
But, Frank, uh,
are we using good judgment?

26:31.298 --> 26:32.340
How's that?

26:32.424 --> 26:36.011
Look, Canetti will settle
for a couple years off max

26:36.094 --> 26:37.137
in federal housing.

26:37.220 --> 26:38.221
When you balance that

26:38.305 --> 26:40.932
against your first down crime
monthlies in two years--

26:41.016 --> 26:43.810
-What's that got to do--
-We're about to blow

26:43.893 --> 26:47.355
any possible favorable news story or two

26:47.439 --> 26:48.982
on this one damn crime wave.

26:49.065 --> 26:51.693
-That's what it's got to do with it.
-Oh, that's great, Warren.

26:51.776 --> 26:52.986
That's just brilliant.

26:53.069 --> 26:54.821
You know where that puts the department?

26:54.904 --> 26:57.490
In the same cage
with the Canetti's of the world.

26:57.574 --> 26:58.825
Dope makes the world go round.

26:58.908 --> 27:00.910
Dope makes the department look good!

27:02.454 --> 27:06.207
You know, I never figured you
to be simple-minded, Furillo.

27:06.291 --> 27:09.502
So I'm gonna interpret this
as a political ploy.

27:09.586 --> 27:10.670
Like the white suit.

27:10.754 --> 27:13.298
The streets are nuts,
but Furillo, he stands tall,

27:13.381 --> 27:15.342
even against the cynics
in his own department.

27:15.425 --> 27:17.636
You're not gonna get that ploy, Frank.
Not this time.

27:17.719 --> 27:20.472
Because you will make
that phone call to the D.A.

27:20.555 --> 27:23.099
that tells him to cop that plea,
you understand that?

27:23.183 --> 27:26.436
-You're making me eat dirt. I won't.
-That's an order, Captain.

27:32.734 --> 27:34.819
Captain, Buntz has got
this Canetti lieutenant

27:34.903 --> 27:36.071
in interrogation.

27:39.699 --> 27:41.451
Lieutenant, read my lips.

27:41.534 --> 27:44.037
I did not create this situation.
You understand?

27:44.120 --> 27:46.373
I'm just riding it out,
just like you people, alright?

27:46.456 --> 27:48.917
Which leaves you where,
vis-à-vis old man Canetti?

27:49.000 --> 27:50.126
Where?

27:50.210 --> 27:53.713
Well, where the old man gets busted
dealing half a lid of smack on the street.

27:53.797 --> 27:56.216
Now, is that the product
of logical thinking to you, huh?

27:56.299 --> 27:58.259
Does that sound like
a man with $11 million?

27:58.343 --> 28:00.470
Little soft in the noggin, huh, Bobby?

28:00.553 --> 28:02.597
(scoffs) Soft?

28:03.723 --> 28:06.559
Soft? The man collects string in a drawer.

28:06.643 --> 28:09.270
He's saving pounds of newspaper
in his closet.

28:09.354 --> 28:11.523
Last week, he goes down,
he puts in an application

28:11.606 --> 28:14.609
at a fast-food restaurant
for a job $3.25 an hour.

28:14.693 --> 28:16.069
Corso nearly has a heart attack.

28:16.152 --> 28:18.488
I got to send somebody down,
withdraw the application.

28:19.072 --> 28:21.032
Mr. Stellini was allowing as

28:21.116 --> 28:23.910
how the onset of Mr. Canetti's senility

28:23.993 --> 28:25.870
has strained his relations with his boss.

28:25.954 --> 28:27.205
Maybe we can help you.

28:27.288 --> 28:28.998
(scoffs) How's that?

28:30.041 --> 28:31.668
Give us Canetti's stash.

28:31.751 --> 28:33.670
Has to be socked away
someplace. Give it to us.

28:33.753 --> 28:35.296
Tie it to Canetti and Corso.

28:35.380 --> 28:37.340
Would that be in line with your ambitions?

28:38.925 --> 28:41.511
Well, then what?
Me and you have a good relationship, huh?

28:41.594 --> 28:43.972
We're never gonna have
a good relationship, Bobby.

28:44.681 --> 28:46.224
But if you testify with immunity,

28:46.307 --> 28:48.935
it would be as if
we shut our eyes and count to ten.

28:49.018 --> 28:51.396
You'll peek. You call my lawyer.

28:52.439 --> 28:56.151
I don't know about your boss, Stellini,
but you're fairly stupid yourself.

28:57.652 --> 29:00.363
You're a drug dealer
making plans to be a bigger drug dealer.

29:00.447 --> 29:02.282
I see no reason not to go for you now.

29:02.365 --> 29:04.576
Except for your man here
totally rousted me.

29:04.659 --> 29:07.996
Well, now, it'd be my word
against yours, huh, Roberto?

29:08.538 --> 29:09.581
Call your lawyer.

29:15.336 --> 29:18.423
-How was the arrest?
-They ask, I lie. Who's kidding who?

29:18.506 --> 29:20.967
I don't want him in here.
I want him out. I want him followed.

29:21.050 --> 29:22.302
You think he goes after Corso?

29:22.385 --> 29:24.763
I don't know where he goes, but he's high.
He'll make some kind of move.

29:24.846 --> 29:27.223
It's Canetti's stash.
I don't think he knows where it's at.

29:27.307 --> 29:29.809
Maybe he'll find out.
Send Washington and LaRue.

29:29.893 --> 29:32.479
MAN: Assistant D.A. Ueker, line two.

29:35.482 --> 29:37.567
Captain says it's bill of rights day.

29:42.906 --> 29:44.908
(indistinct chatter)

29:48.787 --> 29:51.456
Gambling, possession
of gaming instruments,

29:51.539 --> 29:54.250
-disorderly conduct.
-Did you see this message for you?

29:55.001 --> 29:56.002
Thank you.

29:58.671 --> 29:59.714
Trouble, huh?

30:01.007 --> 30:02.217
Go. I'll take it.

30:05.428 --> 30:08.306
Bobby! Hey, bobby!

30:08.389 --> 30:11.100
MAN: Internal Affairs division.
That's on the second floor.

30:11.184 --> 30:13.228
I tried phoning you a couple times, son,

30:13.311 --> 30:14.646
but you must have been busy.

30:14.729 --> 30:17.649
-I want to explain something to you.
-I called the clinic, Reggie.

30:18.274 --> 30:19.651
They never even saw you.

30:20.610 --> 30:22.195
They told you that?

30:22.278 --> 30:24.447
Why would they want
to tell you a lie like that?

30:24.531 --> 30:27.784
-Maybe to protect my confidentiality?
-You're the one that's lying, Reggie.

30:27.867 --> 30:30.328
And it's tired! And it's depressing!

30:30.411 --> 30:32.121
So just get on out of here now.

30:33.748 --> 30:36.793
All right, I told you about that clinic

30:36.876 --> 30:38.962
maybe because you wouldn't believe me.

30:39.045 --> 30:41.965
-But I know what I feel--
-I don't want to hear it, Reggie.

30:43.508 --> 30:45.718
Listen,
I wish you wouldn't call me Reggie.

30:45.802 --> 30:46.886
You know, son,

30:47.637 --> 30:49.806
there's some things that we
got to be talking about,

30:49.889 --> 30:51.224
and it gets more important now.

30:51.307 --> 30:53.518
So why is the first thing
you talk about is money?

30:53.601 --> 30:56.062
And what I want to talk about
is you ain't dying.

30:57.021 --> 30:58.565
Okay, maybe I'm all right.

30:58.648 --> 31:00.942
Maybe I'll live long enough to bury you.

31:01.025 --> 31:04.445
But the point is, Bobby,
I really been wanting to see you, son.

31:05.071 --> 31:06.406
Now you see me.

31:07.866 --> 31:11.077
Bobby, give me a chance.

31:19.002 --> 31:20.879
MAN: Partial I.D. on the vehicle.

31:23.047 --> 31:24.549
What do you want to say to me?

31:33.474 --> 31:34.851
Don't hate me, Bobby.

31:37.395 --> 31:38.605
What else?

31:39.272 --> 31:40.440
What else?

31:41.900 --> 31:43.776
Maybe I shouldn't have come here at all.

31:44.444 --> 31:45.528
Maybe you're right.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.039
You still at the Cumberland?

31:59.125 --> 32:00.293
I don't think it ain't

32:01.044 --> 32:03.880
got to be no more worry
of yours now, Bobby.

32:06.674 --> 32:10.428
I'll pick you up tonight,
take you to the bus.

32:11.888 --> 32:14.432
(indistinct conversations)

32:14.515 --> 32:17.560
(siren wails)

32:23.608 --> 32:24.651
Mick?

32:26.903 --> 32:28.696
I'm okay. Everything's okay.

32:31.699 --> 32:33.201
- What happened?
-It's nothing.

32:33.284 --> 32:35.328
It's run-of-the-mill
lacerations and contusions.

32:35.411 --> 32:38.247
You promised you were gonna
ride a desk, didn't you?

32:39.123 --> 32:41.834
I couldn't. And anyway, I never said that.

32:42.418 --> 32:44.629
No, you broke a promise.

32:44.712 --> 32:46.506
No, I promised I'd be careful.

32:47.256 --> 32:48.841
I, uh...

32:48.925 --> 32:51.803
-I couldn't help it if some idiot--
-A promise is a promise.

32:51.886 --> 32:53.513
No, don't start, okay?

32:58.101 --> 33:00.478
I tell you what, if you're not
gonna do it, I'm gonna do it.

33:00.561 --> 33:02.230
-Do what?
-I'm gonna call your captain.

33:02.313 --> 33:04.148
-You're what?
-I'm gonna call your captain

33:04.232 --> 33:07.068
and I'm gonna tell him
to get you off the street. That's all.

33:07.151 --> 33:08.903
Mick, if you do,

33:08.987 --> 33:10.947
I don't see how things
are ever gonna work out.

33:11.030 --> 33:12.031
You're pregnant!

33:12.115 --> 33:13.491
And what did the doctor tell you?

33:13.574 --> 33:16.202
That I'm supposed to stay calm.
And you're not helping.

33:16.285 --> 33:17.245
And on the average day,

33:17.328 --> 33:19.747
I don't have any more physical
activity than anyone else.

33:19.831 --> 33:23.793
-You don't want to have this baby, do you?
-Don't you ever say that!

33:32.969 --> 33:35.555
NEAL: Maybe he's going home to mama
for a spaghetti dinner.

33:35.638 --> 33:37.473
Not a chance.
All the snort he's been doing,

33:37.557 --> 33:39.225
he won't eat for a week.

33:39.308 --> 33:42.270
-NEAL: Ooh.
LARUE: When you got it, baby, flaunt it.

33:42.353 --> 33:46.024
NEAL: Unit 4011, we have suspect
Stellini approaching premises,

33:46.107 --> 33:49.652
possible narcotics location:
700 block, North Carlin.

33:49.736 --> 33:51.821
Advise units to approach silent.

33:53.698 --> 33:54.907
It's me, Stellini.

33:54.991 --> 33:57.076
NEAL: Don't look to me
like Stellini's expected.

33:57.160 --> 33:58.703
That's it. That's probable cause.

33:58.786 --> 34:00.163
(engine turns over)

34:05.668 --> 34:07.336
(tires screech)

34:11.549 --> 34:12.633
(gunshot)

34:15.553 --> 34:17.346
-Freeze!
-Drop it!

34:17.430 --> 34:20.016
-Come on down here.
-(groans)

34:20.099 --> 34:21.726
-Hit the car!
-(groans)

34:22.935 --> 34:26.230
-Neal, it's in there. We got it.
-(groans)

34:28.107 --> 34:30.193
Hey, hold it, J.D. Hold it!
Don't go in there, man.

34:30.276 --> 34:33.446
-There may be an army in there!
-MAN: Who's there?

34:33.529 --> 34:36.365
Police! Throw your weapon
through the door.

34:36.449 --> 34:38.326
Where did you come from?

34:38.409 --> 34:39.702
Where's your shield?

34:41.412 --> 34:42.580
All right, here.

34:46.751 --> 34:47.835
What are you, crazy?

34:47.919 --> 34:50.546
-That guy tried to rob me!
-(LaRue speaks indistinctly)

34:50.630 --> 34:51.881
Let me get my permit!

34:51.964 --> 34:53.883
Oh, my! Look at this.

34:53.966 --> 34:57.053
Huh? This is it, Neal. This is it.

34:57.136 --> 34:59.972
I can smell it. It's Canetti's stash.

35:00.056 --> 35:03.559
Yeah, it's here. Get Furillo down here.

35:03.643 --> 35:06.020
(siren wailing)

35:10.733 --> 35:11.776
(tires screech)

35:22.120 --> 35:23.579
-J.D., stop it.
-What's up?

35:23.663 --> 35:25.623
-Don't you listen to your radio?
-The guy's a--

35:25.706 --> 35:27.959
The owner of these premises
owns a security service.

35:28.042 --> 35:30.378
-Yeah, that figures.
-Guy's got nothing to do with Canetti!

35:30.461 --> 35:32.421
-But Stellini--
-Stellini broke into the wrong house.

35:32.505 --> 35:34.048
He must have got the wrong address!

35:35.258 --> 35:36.259
Oh, man.

35:36.342 --> 35:38.469
Six-figure lawsuit time, babe.

35:39.262 --> 35:41.472
-Hm.
-(exhales)

35:44.475 --> 35:47.353
My client, Mr. Koch's house
and hearth have been trampled,

35:47.436 --> 35:50.189
his freedoms taken by your jackbooters.

35:50.273 --> 35:52.859
We demand release,
or I'm bringing habeas corpus

35:52.942 --> 35:56.070
-within the hour.
-It's being reviewed right now, Counselor.

35:56.154 --> 35:57.446
It was the Jew's fault.

35:57.530 --> 35:59.031
We were patient with his bungling,

35:59.115 --> 36:00.658
but now we demand satisfaction.

36:00.741 --> 36:03.452
I hope your parade
was satisfactory, Mr. Edsel.

36:03.536 --> 36:05.288
He did nothing to restrain the mob.

36:05.371 --> 36:06.998
Then riffraff vandalized our van.

36:07.081 --> 36:09.375
We hold the Jew accountable, Captain.

36:09.458 --> 36:12.837
If you have a criminal complaint,
see Sergeant Jablonski. Excuse me.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.925
Custodians of law and order.

36:18.009 --> 36:20.887
Jews, now Italians and Slavics.

36:20.970 --> 36:23.890
-MAN: Alright, hang on.
-(telephone rings)

36:23.973 --> 36:27.810
Norman, I want Koch held.
Check his weapons for legal registration.

36:27.894 --> 36:30.438
-The man's got paper, Captain.
-Then review it again.

36:30.521 --> 36:31.647
Review it three times.

36:31.731 --> 36:33.357
If we have any shot at Canetti's stash,

36:33.441 --> 36:35.359
we're gonna have to keep
this incident quiet.

36:35.443 --> 36:37.320
Otherwise, we're dead. It's gone.

36:37.403 --> 36:40.364
Address slipped from Stellini's pockets,
right where he went.

36:40.448 --> 36:42.283
He must have written something down wrong.

36:42.366 --> 36:45.453
Check the street address
for all possible variations:

36:45.536 --> 36:47.330
north, south, numbers inverted.

36:47.413 --> 36:49.540
Check them against Canetti associates.

36:49.624 --> 36:52.293
How's Stellini?
He should be out of surgery right now.

36:52.376 --> 36:53.961
Bates and Coffey are down there.

36:54.045 --> 36:58.257
Edsel come in to thank us
for doing our best to protect him?

36:58.341 --> 36:59.342
No.

37:01.427 --> 37:03.346
Yeah. Yeah, registrations.

37:03.429 --> 37:05.431
You know, that Furillo's
got some equipment.

37:07.516 --> 37:08.809
What sort of equipment?

37:10.645 --> 37:12.813
Yeah, yeah, listen,
I got to run some numbers.

37:13.522 --> 37:15.566
So I want to run them again.
All right, pal?

37:16.275 --> 37:18.819
I'm saying that the man's
showing me something, all right?

37:20.154 --> 37:21.280
What's he showing you?

37:22.073 --> 37:23.199
Lieutenants.

37:24.283 --> 37:26.327
-Inspector Briscoe.
-Inspector.

37:30.873 --> 37:32.124
Where's the plea on Canetti?

37:32.208 --> 37:34.335
You want headlines.
I'm trying to get them for you.

37:34.418 --> 37:36.921
-Where's the plea?
-Bernstein's adjourned till tomorrow.

37:37.004 --> 37:38.881
There's nothing to be
entered till morning.

37:38.965 --> 37:42.718
-Now would you please let me do my job?
-Your job is to obey orders, Furillo.

37:42.802 --> 37:46.097
Honest now, you don't really care
what the story's about

37:46.180 --> 37:48.808
as long as it's hearts and flowers.
I can get it for you, Warren.

37:49.350 --> 37:51.269
I have a shot at Canetti's drugs.

37:51.352 --> 37:53.646
Or would you rather I not look so good?

37:53.729 --> 37:55.856
Would you rather
the headlines came elsewhere?

37:55.940 --> 37:57.233
Don't say that, Frank.

37:57.316 --> 37:59.402
Don't make me smaller than I am.

37:59.485 --> 38:00.987
Nor you me.

38:01.070 --> 38:03.864
Excuse. Coffey called.
Stellini just gave us somebody.

38:03.948 --> 38:07.034
The address checks. It's 1759, not 759.

38:07.118 --> 38:08.244
Let's get a warrant.

38:10.830 --> 38:12.331
Okay, gentlemen.

38:13.040 --> 38:16.919
Now, you both agree you're gonna
abide by these findings.

38:17.003 --> 38:18.254
Give me the basket.

38:18.838 --> 38:20.172
Basket weighs half a pound.

38:20.256 --> 38:21.674
Now you're gonna see.

38:22.800 --> 38:23.968
Three.

38:26.679 --> 38:27.805
Seven.

38:32.643 --> 38:33.811
Eleven.

38:36.856 --> 38:39.442
-Thirteen, maybe fourteen.
-Thirteen?

38:39.525 --> 38:41.527
I told you he was underpricing those kids.

38:41.610 --> 38:43.988
There's 14 cans in there. You're crazy.

38:44.071 --> 38:45.197
Who you calling crazy?

38:45.281 --> 38:49.368
You! Shouldn't be allowed
nowhere near those kids.

38:49.452 --> 38:51.037
Who knows what he's doing to them.

38:51.120 --> 38:52.955
What's that? What's that?

38:53.039 --> 38:55.541
JABLONSKI: Hey, hey, hey! That's enough!

38:55.624 --> 38:57.251
(shouting)

38:57.335 --> 38:59.795
-Father, that's enough!
-Let me at him!

38:59.879 --> 39:01.881
Come on over here. Come on.

39:01.964 --> 39:03.924
You're disgrace to the clergy.

39:04.008 --> 39:05.343
JABLONSKI: Get him out of here.

39:09.930 --> 39:12.475
I don't know what's happening anymore.

39:12.558 --> 39:13.559
Sit down.

39:17.063 --> 39:18.773
What's the matter with me, Stanley?

39:19.982 --> 39:21.901
I was just about to ask you
the same question.

39:23.444 --> 39:25.071
It's the injustice.

39:26.614 --> 39:28.991
I'm so out of control.

39:31.869 --> 39:33.788
Sometimes I get so angry!

39:34.372 --> 39:36.248
Yeah, I don't know
about injustice, Father.

39:36.332 --> 39:38.459
All I know is you just tried to hit a guy.

39:38.542 --> 39:39.835
(sighs)

39:39.919 --> 39:41.587
Where's the justice in that?

39:41.670 --> 39:45.007
The point is... the point is those kids.

39:45.091 --> 39:46.967
We're trying to get them
out of a violent life

39:47.051 --> 39:48.427
into a more productive life.

39:48.511 --> 39:50.012
And you go around street brawling.

39:50.805 --> 39:54.100
You're right, Stanley.
You're absolutely right.

39:55.267 --> 39:57.269
Sometimes I think I ought
to put down the collar

39:57.353 --> 39:59.814
and go to Poland or Central America,

39:59.897 --> 40:01.774
where I can take up arms.

40:01.857 --> 40:03.442
Plenty of soldiers, Father.

40:03.526 --> 40:06.278
What there's a shortage of
is good parish priests.

40:06.362 --> 40:09.240
Sure there's a shortage,
if you leave off guys like me,

40:09.323 --> 40:11.033
who really aren't fit to wear the collar.

40:11.117 --> 40:13.285
Hey, what am I hearing here?

40:13.369 --> 40:15.955
I assaulted a man. I ought to be arrested.

40:16.038 --> 40:17.498
Well, I'm not gonna bust you.

40:19.125 --> 40:22.211
-Supposing he presses charges?
-He's not gonna press charges.

40:22.294 --> 40:23.504
We're gonna work it out.

40:25.673 --> 40:28.634
Now, Father, why don't you apologize?

40:30.052 --> 40:32.304
Reimburse him, maybe,
for the ten bucks you took.

40:33.514 --> 40:36.434
And maybe we can get him
back on board, hmm?

40:38.519 --> 40:40.813
No Hail Marys or penance?

40:41.814 --> 40:42.982
I'm a cop.

40:43.858 --> 40:46.068
I don't give advice
of no spiritual nature.

40:48.154 --> 40:50.906
-They gonna arrest him, father?
-Quiet now!

40:50.990 --> 40:54.785
Ah, Mr. Glynn, the father
has something he wants to say.

40:54.869 --> 40:55.953
Go on.

40:56.620 --> 41:01.000
Even a spiritual man
can be bested by passion.

41:01.917 --> 41:04.795
I'm not tearing up this complaint,
if that's what you're driving at.

41:04.879 --> 41:07.923
Mr. Glynn, if we lock up the father,
all the good he's done for these kids,

41:08.007 --> 41:10.509
-that will go down the drain.
-You were there.

41:10.593 --> 41:11.760
You saw what he did.

41:11.844 --> 41:13.053
All I'm saying is,

41:13.137 --> 41:15.764
you get your truck,
and you pick up the cans.

41:15.848 --> 41:18.517
-Like before.
-And you get 14 cans per pound.

41:18.601 --> 41:21.103
-Fifteen.
-Fifteen if there's a little dirt,

41:21.187 --> 41:22.897
13 if they're total empties.

41:22.980 --> 41:25.024
The main thing is that
we get these kids to camp.

41:25.107 --> 41:26.442
That's priority number one.

41:26.525 --> 41:28.486
And you and me, we don't have
no more dealings.

41:28.569 --> 41:29.778
That's in the past.

41:29.862 --> 41:31.947
You have my word as a man of God.

41:32.031 --> 41:35.493
And you kids,
you watch out for the dirt, okay?

41:35.576 --> 41:37.703
That way, you'll get a better price, okay?

41:37.786 --> 41:39.079
-Yeah.
-Okay.

41:39.163 --> 41:42.333
-Where's my ten bucks?
-Oh...

41:42.416 --> 41:44.418
Neal, J.D., Coffey, let's go.

41:44.502 --> 41:45.878
Sarge, will you handle that?

41:51.592 --> 41:53.135
Okay, Lieutenant.

41:53.219 --> 41:56.388
We're getting the runaround,
and we're filing our writ now.

41:56.472 --> 41:58.599
Attorney Richards,
let's be realists, okay?

41:58.682 --> 42:01.185
A situation has developed here
that we don't want you to blow

42:01.268 --> 42:03.479
with your fat mouth
and all your writs, okay?

42:03.562 --> 42:04.772
Now, if I was you,

42:04.855 --> 42:07.525
I'd consider that your man
got caught with 80 guns,

42:07.608 --> 42:09.735
which I will personally
keep on checking out

42:09.818 --> 42:12.029
till the year 1992

42:12.112 --> 42:15.032
if we don't see just a little
cooperation around here, okay?

42:15.115 --> 42:18.702
And no more writs, for three,
maybe four, hours. Huh?

42:20.246 --> 42:22.414
Freeze! Police!

42:22.498 --> 42:24.625
-Up, up, come on!
-Alright, freeze!

42:24.708 --> 42:26.585
-(toilet flushes)
-Let's go. Nobody move.

42:26.669 --> 42:28.128
You, right there, hold it!

42:29.213 --> 42:31.215
MAN: All right, don't shoot! Don't shoot!

42:31.298 --> 42:32.883
Hey, Harry! Harry, cool it.

42:32.967 --> 42:34.677
You're gonna jam up the plumbing here.

42:35.636 --> 42:37.721
Stop it! That's enough!

42:40.307 --> 42:42.518
-This is all pure heroin?
-No, it's not!

42:42.601 --> 42:43.894
All right, Harry.

42:43.978 --> 42:45.521
You have the right to remain silent.

42:45.604 --> 42:48.983
ANNOUNCER: <i>Bus 81</i>
<i>now departing from gate 2A,</i>

42:49.066 --> 42:53.988
<i>that's 2A, for Roanoke,</i>
<i>Virginia, and points east.</i>

42:54.071 --> 42:55.573
Say hi to auntie.

42:57.950 --> 42:59.076
I will.

42:59.159 --> 43:03.038
Bobby, you look better
without the mustache.

43:05.082 --> 43:06.041
No more passengers.

43:06.125 --> 43:08.210
What do you mean?
I got my ticket and everything.

43:08.294 --> 43:09.461
Yeah, but I'm full.

43:09.545 --> 43:12.172
Another bus will be here
in about an hour and a half, okay?

43:21.765 --> 43:23.517
Now don't worry. You don't got to wait.

43:25.185 --> 43:26.645
I guess that's goodbye then.

43:28.272 --> 43:29.189
I guess so.

43:29.273 --> 43:31.650
ANNOUNCER: <i>Bus 59 Rom Omaha,</i>
<i>pick up your baggage...</i>

43:31.734 --> 43:32.943
(coughs)

43:33.027 --> 43:34.236
You all right?

43:34.320 --> 43:36.322
Oh, it's just this climate.

43:39.617 --> 43:40.826
Listen, Bobby...

43:44.371 --> 43:45.914
you take care of yourself.

43:48.125 --> 43:50.085
You too, Dad.

43:52.588 --> 43:53.631
Go on.

43:56.800 --> 43:58.927
I don't mind waiting with you.

43:59.011 --> 44:00.179
Oh, hush.

44:01.263 --> 44:04.350
I'll just sit here and read this paper.

44:06.268 --> 44:09.605
(sentimental music playing)

44:09.688 --> 44:10.814
(moans)

44:21.867 --> 44:25.954
-(sports anchor narrates game on TV)
-(indistinct conversations)

44:26.038 --> 44:29.541
Now, you know what I'm gonna tell you,
but since you ain't gonna listen to me,

44:29.625 --> 44:32.002
-I ain't gonna say it.
-Good. Don't.

44:32.086 --> 44:34.630
But since you asked, I will. (exhales)

44:34.713 --> 44:36.382
I think it is a disgrace,

44:36.465 --> 44:40.010
you leaving an old, sick man
all alone in a bus station.

44:41.679 --> 44:43.931
Renko, the man sees me as an easy mark.

44:44.014 --> 44:47.393
He doesn't want to spend two hours with me
any more than I want to spend it with him.

44:47.476 --> 44:49.144
And I told you, he is not sick.

44:49.228 --> 44:52.064
Don't look so good to me.
Looks like he's lost weight to me.

44:53.232 --> 44:54.983
He didn't look good to you?

44:55.067 --> 44:57.277
Even if he lived to be 112 years old,

44:57.361 --> 45:00.656
I'd say the same thing:
talk it out with the man.

45:00.739 --> 45:02.157
We talked.

45:02.241 --> 45:03.909
There's nothing more to say.

45:03.992 --> 45:05.661
You're talking about something

45:05.744 --> 45:07.955
-that you know absolutely nothing about.
-See, see?

45:08.038 --> 45:09.832
You ask my opinion, then you stonewall me,

45:09.915 --> 45:11.834
because I'm talking about
something I know nothing about.

45:11.917 --> 45:13.836
I'll tell you one thing
I know something about.

45:13.919 --> 45:15.045
He is your daddy,

45:15.129 --> 45:17.715
and as much as you deny it,
you are his son.

45:17.798 --> 45:19.758
And in many ways, you take after him.

45:19.842 --> 45:22.720
He had absolutely nothing
to do with who I am.

45:23.387 --> 45:25.514
Everything I am, I am in spite of him.

45:25.597 --> 45:28.100
Which is precisely my point.

45:30.936 --> 45:32.104
I can't.

45:35.399 --> 45:37.526
You know, there are times
that I'm ashamed for you.

45:39.611 --> 45:40.821
I'll see you later.

45:46.452 --> 45:49.955
<i>I want to particularly</i>
<i>praise the work of Officer Joseph Coffey,</i>

45:50.831 --> 45:52.666
<i>who made the original</i>
<i>arrest on Mr. Canetti</i>

45:52.750 --> 45:55.085
<i>and seized the drugs</i>
<i>in a subsequent incident.</i>

45:55.169 --> 45:58.464
<i>This seizure constitutes</i>
<i>the largest in the state...</i>

45:58.547 --> 45:59.673
(clicks remote)

45:59.757 --> 46:00.966
What about Arthur?

46:02.676 --> 46:04.470
Thought we didn't plea-bargain at night.

46:05.179 --> 46:06.597
What about Arthur Sims?

46:06.680 --> 46:08.348
Canetti's finished. You've got him.

46:09.683 --> 46:11.560
"A" misdemeanor possession
if it works out.

46:11.643 --> 46:12.728
"B" misdemeanor

46:13.645 --> 46:15.814
on account of the impossible time
you've given him

46:15.898 --> 46:17.775
just because you wanted Canetti.

46:17.858 --> 46:20.319
Your client possessed heroin.
That's a crime.

46:20.402 --> 46:22.738
(gasps) No!

46:24.573 --> 46:26.366
-I didn't know that.
-Mmm.

46:27.117 --> 46:28.911
-(chuckles)
-Mmm.

46:28.994 --> 46:31.330
"B" misdemeanor. I'll check with Irwin.

46:31.413 --> 46:33.624
Oh, my hero.

46:34.875 --> 46:36.418
-Ugh!
-Mmm.

46:36.502 --> 46:38.337
-Frank?
-Hmm?

46:38.420 --> 46:40.881
I borrowed some old,
gray flannels and brogues

46:40.964 --> 46:43.175
so my client would have
something nice to wear.

46:43.258 --> 46:47.429
Hmm, no deal till I get them back.

46:48.055 --> 46:49.848
Don't worry. He hated them.

46:49.932 --> 46:53.185
(both laugh)

46:53.268 --> 46:55.395
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Ten minutes till departure time.</i>

46:55.479 --> 46:58.857
<i>Bus 61, New York City,</i>
<i>Boston, and Philadelphia.</i>

46:58.941 --> 47:01.360
-Excuse me. Bus to Roanoke?
-Gate 12.

47:01.443 --> 47:03.654
-Did it leave yet?
-Check the board!

47:05.697 --> 47:07.658
ANNOUNCER: <i>Passengers for Springfield,</i>

47:07.741 --> 47:09.660
<i>this is the last call for bus 18.</i>

47:12.412 --> 47:14.456
<i>Local bus 23 is arriving...</i>

47:14.540 --> 47:16.792
Hey! Hey!

47:18.585 --> 47:19.545
Dad!

47:21.046 --> 47:22.089
Reggie Hill?

47:22.923 --> 47:24.132
Reggie Hill on board?

47:24.216 --> 47:25.884
Hey, you coming or staying?

47:25.968 --> 47:27.636
Uh, bus to Roanoke?

47:27.719 --> 47:30.347
Roanoke? Just left. Just missed it.

47:31.390 --> 47:35.269
(dramatic music playing)

47:48.073 --> 47:52.327
(theme music playing)
