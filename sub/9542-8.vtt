00:04.000 --> 00:06.793
Jerry, I'm a reasonable man.
You're a semi-reasonable man.

00:06.828 --> 00:09.035
You talk to Mr. Kramer.
I'll talk to Mrs. Kramer.

00:09.070 --> 00:11.195
Maybe everybody can move
an inch or two on this one.

00:11.230 --> 00:12.186
Hang on a second.

00:12.221 --> 00:14.939
- Who's the lucky guy?
- None of your business. You okay?

00:14.974 --> 00:16.364
Yeah. Okay.

00:17.062 --> 00:18.807
Jerry, you say that again,

00:18.842 --> 00:21.374
and I'm gonna take you
to court to support it.

00:29.947 --> 00:30.908
Yeah.

00:35.034 --> 00:36.994
Oh, God! Take anything...

00:37.029 --> 00:38.924
Take anything you want!
Wait! Ugh!

01:20.961 --> 01:22.006
Lou?

01:27.021 --> 01:27.914
Lou?

01:35.529 --> 01:41.132
MONK Season 1 Epi. 07
Mr. Monk and the Other Woman

02:26.111 --> 02:28.033
She's always with me.

02:29.613 --> 02:31.839
Every time I close my eyes.

02:33.246 --> 02:35.667
She's always 34 years old.

02:36.833 --> 02:39.169
She's always wearing the same dress.

02:40.881 --> 02:43.302
And she's always so...

02:43.337 --> 02:44.510
Adrian?

02:48.092 --> 02:50.346
I have something to say.

02:52.517 --> 02:54.601
It's been four years since you lost Trudy.

02:54.636 --> 02:56.368
That-That's a long time.

02:57.854 --> 02:59.740
- It is?
- Yeah.

02:59.775 --> 03:03.706
Have you ever considered dating again?

03:03.741 --> 03:04.735
No.

03:06.653 --> 03:09.284
I've thought about thinking about it.

03:10.574 --> 03:13.660
And what?
You don't follow through because...

03:13.695 --> 03:15.955
It's inconceivable.

03:16.870 --> 03:21.634
I can't think about anything...
life, other people...

03:21.669 --> 03:24.423
until I find out who murdered her.

03:25.840 --> 03:26.968
Adrian?

03:27.973 --> 03:29.057
Adrian?

03:29.591 --> 03:33.974
Oh, it's a pebble or something.
It's been driving me crazy all day.

03:34.598 --> 03:39.103
W-Would you say that
Trudy was the perfect woman?

03:39.138 --> 03:41.189
You know that phrase
"my better half'?

03:41.224 --> 03:44.531
I never really thought about it
much until she died.

03:44.566 --> 03:47.310
She was my better half.

03:48.029 --> 03:49.655
I love that phrase.

03:49.690 --> 03:51.131
My better half.

03:51.166 --> 03:53.829
My better half.
Ah, yes, there it is.

04:02.001 --> 04:03.171
That's it?

04:04.127 --> 04:05.921
Sensitive feet.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.942
Do you have a copy of the case file?

04:16.978 --> 04:18.601
No, not an extra one.

04:19.144 --> 04:20.744
We're supposed to have a copy.

04:20.779 --> 04:22.108
Can I ask you something?

04:22.363 --> 04:24.398
Why are you even here?

04:24.706 --> 04:27.569
We're here because the victim
was a friend of the mayor's.

04:27.604 --> 04:29.780
Yeah, I know.
They were golfing buddies.

04:29.815 --> 04:33.922
Well, I guess His Honor wanted to
make sure you didn't screw everything up.

04:33.957 --> 04:36.007
- This scene is cold.
- Yeah.

04:36.042 --> 04:38.511
The party's pretty much over.
It all went down on Monday night.

04:38.546 --> 04:39.830
Forty-eight hours.

04:39.865 --> 04:41.956
I really needed to be here
from the beginning.

04:42.669 --> 04:44.500
Adrian, Adrian, that is not true.

04:44.535 --> 04:47.003
There must have been
a dozen cops through here.

04:47.038 --> 04:50.217
Adrian, you promised the mayor.

04:50.252 --> 04:54.229
Okay, look at... look at me...
and stay calm.

04:55.056 --> 04:56.141
Okay?

04:57.146 --> 04:58.611
You're the best.

05:03.983 --> 05:05.950
There was a struggle.

05:12.702 --> 05:15.575
The victim was stabbed.

05:15.610 --> 05:17.114
Yeah, that's right.

05:17.149 --> 05:18.826
How do you know he was stabbed?

05:18.861 --> 05:20.121
I mean, he could've been shot.

05:20.156 --> 05:25.131
No. You can smell gunpowder residue
in a room this size for four days.

05:25.791 --> 05:27.796
- You can?
- He can.

05:27.831 --> 05:31.422
And then the victim was
strangled too. - Yeah.

05:31.457 --> 05:33.509
You wouldn't happen to know with what?

05:33.544 --> 05:35.927
A... phone cord.

05:36.100 --> 05:39.015
You can see.
It's-It's stretched out.

05:39.365 --> 05:44.480
Oh, yeah. We, uh...
We must've missed that.

05:47.611 --> 05:49.199
What happened here?

05:49.234 --> 05:50.984
His assistant must've walked in on it.

05:51.019 --> 05:53.445
She was stabbed too. D. O. A.
At the hospital.

05:53.480 --> 05:55.107
Two victims?

05:57.827 --> 05:59.619
I wanna see more.

06:02.621 --> 06:03.830
This is all moot, Monk.

06:03.865 --> 06:05.669
We already have a suspect.

06:05.849 --> 06:07.252
Who's that?

06:07.287 --> 06:10.129
His name is Lawrence Grayson.
Pratt was his attorney.

06:10.164 --> 06:12.606
They lost a case about
a year and a half ago.

06:13.507 --> 06:16.485
I guess, uh, Grayson wasn't
a very satisfied client.

06:16.520 --> 06:18.513
A year and a half?

06:18.548 --> 06:21.183
That's what I call holding a grudge.

06:22.891 --> 06:25.029
- He burned something?
- He burned his own file.

06:25.064 --> 06:26.116
The guy was a moron.

06:26.151 --> 06:29.154
There were duplicate copies all over
the office that he didn't even touch.

06:29.189 --> 06:32.580
Why didn't he just take the file
with him and burn it later?

06:32.615 --> 06:34.403
The captain figured he panicked.

06:37.407 --> 06:39.408
It doesn't make sense.

06:39.573 --> 06:40.703
What doesn't?

06:41.255 --> 06:42.996
The whole thing.

06:44.429 --> 06:46.865
I want to talk to this Grayson.

06:47.417 --> 06:49.545
Okay. But I should tell you,

06:49.580 --> 06:52.462
Captain Stottlemeyer's not very happy
you're on the case.

06:52.497 --> 06:54.302
- Did he say something?
- He didn't have to.

06:54.337 --> 06:57.008
I've been working with him
for four years now.

06:57.260 --> 07:00.195
I know him.
You pick up little signs.

07:01.564 --> 07:03.100
- What is your name?
- Stooben.

07:03.135 --> 07:05.226
Everything with the lawyer's name on it,
you bag it.

07:05.261 --> 07:07.617
You don't walk around with it.
You bag it.

07:07.652 --> 07:09.073
Understood? - Yes, sir.

07:09.108 --> 07:09.940
Okay.

07:12.943 --> 07:14.692
How am I doing, Monk?

07:15.168 --> 07:16.003
Fine.

07:16.863 --> 07:18.449
Oh, if you talk to the mayor,

07:18.484 --> 07:21.324
tell him thanks very much
for this vote of confidence.

07:21.359 --> 07:22.855
You can'tjust barge in here.
And rip my house apart.

07:22.890 --> 07:25.838
How do I know I'm gonna get this stuffback?

07:25.873 --> 07:27.901
You'll get a complete inventory
when we're through.

07:27.936 --> 07:29.687
Oh, yeah?
I'm calling my lawyer.

07:29.722 --> 07:32.355
Your lawyer's dead, sir.
That's why we're here.

07:35.744 --> 07:36.927
Hey. Hey. Hey, hey.

07:36.962 --> 07:38.176
Do you mind? Please.

07:38.211 --> 07:41.383
Hang on! Another step,
and I'll arrest you for obstruction.

07:41.418 --> 07:43.409
That's a very impressive collection,
Mr. Grayson.

07:43.444 --> 07:45.032
Thank you very much.
Yeah, I'm a collector.

07:45.067 --> 07:46.601
Everything in there's legit, okay?

07:46.636 --> 07:48.087
I got paper on everything in there.

07:48.122 --> 07:50.683
It's a hobby.
I'm permitted to have a hobby, am I not?

07:50.718 --> 07:53.694
Excuse me.
Is that your truck parked out front?

07:53.729 --> 07:54.979
Yeah, that's my truck.

07:55.123 --> 07:58.001
You own your own security company?

07:58.036 --> 07:59.070
Yes, I do.

07:59.391 --> 08:02.115
Now, why would I kill Lou Pratt, okay?

08:02.150 --> 08:03.884
He's been my lawyer for 22 years.

08:03.919 --> 08:05.779
There are 4,000 files in that office.

08:05.814 --> 08:08.859
The killer went out of his way
to burn just one of them... yours.

08:08.894 --> 08:09.891
Mine?

08:10.149 --> 08:13.328
Okay, so he burns my file.
So what?

08:13.363 --> 08:15.697
- You owed him some money.
- Yeah, 400 bucks.

08:15.732 --> 08:17.170
I'm suing the bitch next door,

08:17.205 --> 08:19.543
he screws up the case,
I refuse to pay him.

08:19.578 --> 08:22.243
I'm gonna kill him for 400 bucks?
I don't think so.

08:22.931 --> 08:25.147
Can I have permission to walk my dog?

08:25.182 --> 08:27.927
- You guys are making him goofy.
- Permission granted.

08:27.962 --> 08:30.081
- Thank you.
- Keep an eye on him.

08:31.570 --> 08:33.505
Here, Bobo. Come here.

08:41.563 --> 08:43.991
- What?
- That guy...

08:44.884 --> 08:47.608
owns a security company.

08:47.844 --> 08:50.507
He could've picked any
lock in that office...

08:50.805 --> 08:53.158
but he broke a window.

08:53.391 --> 08:55.621
Yeah, this guy is not stupid.

08:55.656 --> 08:57.859
He knows we know he can pick a lock.

08:57.894 --> 08:59.940
He tried to throw us a curveball.

09:02.987 --> 09:05.005
It doesn't make any sense.

09:05.040 --> 09:07.424
Does everything have
to make sense, Monk?

09:08.511 --> 09:11.807
Well, yeah, it kinda does.

09:12.986 --> 09:14.408
See that?

09:14.443 --> 09:16.696
They're in my house right now.
They're ripping the whole place apart.

09:16.731 --> 09:18.104
It's not my problem.

09:18.139 --> 09:21.128
You made it your problem
when you built that thing, sweetheart.

09:21.163 --> 09:23.093
What is with you and my garage?

09:23.128 --> 09:25.185
It's over, okay?
You lost the case.

09:25.220 --> 09:27.035
Garage.
That thing is a shopping mall.

09:27.070 --> 09:28.945
- It's not a garage.
- Oh, come on!

09:28.980 --> 09:30.464
You understand what "setback" means?

09:30.499 --> 09:32.728
You understand what rules and
regulations are? - Is that the neighbor?

09:32.763 --> 09:34.079
Monica Waters.

09:34.114 --> 09:36.377
She owns a travel agency
in Westbrook Mall.

09:36.412 --> 09:39.339
You're like this broken record.
You just keep going on and on.

09:39.374 --> 09:41.058
I see you got your own address
on there now.

09:41.093 --> 09:43.044
Pretty soon you're gonna qualify
for its own zip code.

09:43.079 --> 09:45.553
- Who are you to talk about regulations?
- Excuse me?

09:45.588 --> 09:49.647
That dog of yours is a public menace.
It's never on a leash,

09:49.682 --> 09:52.432
and every kid in the neighborhood
is frightened to death of it.

09:52.467 --> 09:53.758
Don't give me that.

09:53.793 --> 09:57.062
This is a champion show dog right here,
and it's bred for temperament.

09:57.097 --> 09:59.032
Oh, right, right.
I'll try to remember that...

09:59.067 --> 10:01.954
when I have to unfasten his jaw
from my leg!

10:01.989 --> 10:04.106
Excuse me.
This dog is no show dog.

10:04.141 --> 10:05.391
What are you saying?

10:05.545 --> 10:08.266
Show dogs have to be purebred.

10:08.301 --> 10:09.759
This is not a pure Rottweiler.

10:09.794 --> 10:11.497
You can tell by the paws.

10:12.354 --> 10:14.625
They're... They're too big.

10:15.342 --> 10:18.894
- The paws are too big?
- They're too big.

10:21.128 --> 10:22.415
My hero.

10:23.100 --> 10:26.516
Okay, Mr. Grayson,
why don't we take that little walk now?

10:26.551 --> 10:29.330
I'd love to come back and
visit you sometime about that badge.

10:29.365 --> 10:31.585
Bring your little buddy there too.
Not a purebred.

10:31.620 --> 10:34.905
- Let's go.
- Let's get away from here.

10:36.075 --> 10:37.573
Monk, are you coming?

10:37.608 --> 10:41.705
L-I think I'll check out the garage.

10:50.037 --> 10:51.732
Are you okay?

10:51.767 --> 10:52.714
Mm-hmm.

10:54.763 --> 10:57.183
You know who she looks like
in a weird way?

10:58.451 --> 11:00.210
Trudy.

11:00.529 --> 11:03.798
You think? - Mm-hmm.

11:17.834 --> 11:19.132
What's he doing?

11:19.380 --> 11:21.591
It's his... It's his thing.

11:26.158 --> 11:27.828
When was it built?

11:28.154 --> 11:29.929
Two years ago.

11:29.964 --> 11:33.865
That's about the time your husband
moved out?

11:35.385 --> 11:36.645
How did you know that?

11:36.680 --> 11:40.384
Pachysandra under the basketball net.
About two year's worth.

11:40.682 --> 11:43.645
Wow.
That's twice you've impressed me.

11:43.680 --> 11:45.856
A new world record.
I'm Monica.

11:45.891 --> 11:48.007
Monica Waters.
And you are?

11:49.305 --> 11:53.973
Um, me. Um...

11:54.008 --> 11:55.718
- Monk.
- Monk.

11:55.753 --> 11:57.390
Adrian Monk.

11:58.737 --> 12:00.203
Hi.

12:01.316 --> 12:05.408
Oh, it's, uh... It's... I, um...

12:07.317 --> 12:09.933
Could I take a look inside the garage?

12:09.968 --> 12:12.035
Yeah, sure. You'll need this.

12:14.101 --> 12:15.590
Thanks.

12:20.179 --> 12:21.734
He's a detective?

12:21.769 --> 12:23.847
A private consultant.

12:23.882 --> 12:25.265
- Is he married?
- No.

12:25.300 --> 12:27.215
He's wearing a wedding band.

12:27.712 --> 12:29.597
He thinks about his wife a lot.

12:29.632 --> 12:31.399
You know, she's deceased.

12:31.434 --> 12:34.534
- Oh. He's "germaphobic"?
- Yep.

12:35.163 --> 12:38.510
With classic obsessive-compulsive
tendencies.

12:39.261 --> 12:41.248
How did you know that?

12:41.283 --> 12:45.329
- Oh, my God.! Oh, my God.!
- What?

12:45.882 --> 12:47.833
Oh, my God!

12:47.868 --> 12:49.465
What's wrong?

12:50.758 --> 12:53.120
It's perfect.
It's immaculate.

12:53.155 --> 12:57.172
You see, it's divided into
different sections...

12:57.207 --> 13:01.642
gardening, automotive.

13:02.465 --> 13:04.960
You made little labels...

13:04.995 --> 13:07.606
so that you always know
where everything goes.

13:07.641 --> 13:11.796
My husband was very organized,
so I guess it kind of rubbed off.

13:12.947 --> 13:16.285
Hold it! Hold it.

13:18.121 --> 13:19.663
May I?

13:26.149 --> 13:27.875
That's got it.

13:29.205 --> 13:30.928
May I say something?

13:31.638 --> 13:34.263
If I ever have a garage,

13:35.317 --> 13:38.623
I want it to look just like this.

13:40.279 --> 13:42.292
Well, is there anything else?

13:42.327 --> 13:44.822
No. No, not... not really.

13:44.857 --> 13:48.513
Okay. Well, it was
very nice meeting you, Mr. Monk.

13:48.548 --> 13:51.871
Uh-Uh, however, in the future,

13:51.906 --> 13:54.639
I might have quite a few questions.

13:54.900 --> 13:58.155
Okay, so how does that work?
Should I come to your precinct?

13:58.190 --> 14:00.906
Well, no. I don't really
have an office there.

14:01.064 --> 14:04.421
We could have coffee, or...

14:04.456 --> 14:07.372
or do you eat dinner?

14:08.176 --> 14:11.193
Yes, I-I've been known to eat dinner.

14:13.588 --> 14:15.589
Do I eat dinner?

14:16.055 --> 14:17.280
Yeah, you eat dinner.

14:17.315 --> 14:19.103
We both eat dinner.

14:19.985 --> 14:21.761
Then it's a date.

14:28.544 --> 14:30.442
"It's a date"?

14:43.888 --> 14:47.488
This place has really changed.

14:47.523 --> 14:48.573
You've been here before?

14:48.608 --> 14:50.522
We used to come here all the time.

14:50.557 --> 14:51.810
You and your wife?

14:52.101 --> 14:56.483
Yeah, it's so different.
That blackboard was over there,

14:56.518 --> 14:59.572
and I think the salt and
pepper shakers are new.

14:59.903 --> 15:01.528
Is that it?

15:03.947 --> 15:07.202
Yeah, that... that's it.

15:07.625 --> 15:09.000
You don't like change, do you?

15:09.035 --> 15:10.789
I have no problem with change.

15:10.824 --> 15:13.291
I just don't like to be
there when it happens.

15:13.701 --> 15:14.971
Hi. I'm Vickie.

15:15.006 --> 15:19.006
Hi, Vickie. I'm Adrian Monk,
and this is Monica Waters.

15:19.682 --> 15:22.634
Hi. - I'll have the Caesar salad and
some coffee, please.

15:22.669 --> 15:24.517
Great. - And I'll have the veal.

15:24.552 --> 15:25.344
Okay.

15:25.379 --> 15:29.098
- And, uh... Oh, never mind.
- Okay.

15:29.133 --> 15:30.824
Excuse me.

15:31.102 --> 15:36.397
I wonder, could I get separate plates
for the potatoes and the vegetables?

15:36.432 --> 15:39.413
You want them all on separate plates?

15:39.448 --> 15:42.029
- Please.
- Okay.

15:45.404 --> 15:47.407
You don't like your food to touch?

15:47.442 --> 15:50.076
I believe most people don't like
their food to touch.

15:50.111 --> 15:52.954
They just don't have the guts to admit it.

15:54.163 --> 15:56.884
And I bet you bring your own silverware.

15:57.751 --> 16:00.422
No. Please.
I'm not a fanatic.

16:01.466 --> 16:03.840
So, you said you had quite a few questions.

16:03.875 --> 16:06.135
That may have been an exaggeration.

16:06.985 --> 16:08.396
How many do you have?

16:08.431 --> 16:11.483
None. I have none.

16:12.768 --> 16:15.488
Don't you want to ask me about Grayson,
the neighbor from hell?

16:15.523 --> 16:17.437
No. I don't think he did it.

16:17.472 --> 16:20.121
I don't... I don't buy the motive.

16:23.667 --> 16:28.247
Then what are we doing here,
Mr. Monk?

16:33.246 --> 16:34.972
I'm not sure.

16:38.217 --> 16:41.461
Okay, then I have a question for you.

16:41.496 --> 16:45.466
Sharona said after your wife died,
you never left the house.

16:45.501 --> 16:46.676
That's not true.

16:46.711 --> 16:50.719
I went outside to get the paper... twice.

16:50.754 --> 16:52.516
And now you're a famous detective.

16:52.551 --> 16:55.100
Oh, far from famous.

16:55.269 --> 16:57.019
The other cops certainly respect you.

16:57.054 --> 16:58.898
The mayor calls you and depends on you.

16:58.933 --> 17:01.149
You're obviously out of the house.

17:01.184 --> 17:02.951
How did you do it?

17:02.986 --> 17:05.413
Captain Stottlemeyer was
worried about me,

17:05.448 --> 17:10.115
and he hired a nurse to take care of me.

17:10.150 --> 17:12.911
She showed up one day and just never left.

17:12.945 --> 17:15.455
You got lucky.
You found the right person.

17:16.791 --> 17:19.165
That's a secret, isn't it?

17:22.753 --> 17:24.814
How long were you married?

17:26.096 --> 17:28.386
Oh, look! A jukebox!

17:41.062 --> 17:43.149
D-7.

17:53.700 --> 18:00.129
¢Ü I don't know if it's cloudy or bright ¢Ü

18:00.164 --> 18:05.230
¢Ü I only have eyes ¢Ü

18:07.355 --> 18:11.901
¢Ü For you ¢Ü

18:32.248 --> 18:35.075
So how did it go last night?

18:35.110 --> 18:36.537
Fine.

18:36.572 --> 18:38.506
What did you talk about?

18:38.845 --> 18:40.955
Mostly we talked about me.

18:41.414 --> 18:44.418
She-She kept asking me questions.

18:44.453 --> 18:46.048
Really?

18:47.879 --> 18:49.051
Yeah.

18:50.049 --> 18:53.473
Yeah. I think maybe she's interested in me.

18:53.508 --> 18:57.390
- Okay.
- Is that impossible?

18:57.425 --> 19:01.309
That a woman like her could
be interested in me?

19:03.436 --> 19:04.989
Sharona.

19:05.857 --> 19:08.026
I'm thinking.

19:12.238 --> 19:14.420
Talk about nerve.

19:14.455 --> 19:17.495
He kills the guy,
then shows up at the funeral.

19:17.530 --> 19:19.246
I don't think he killed anybody.

19:19.281 --> 19:21.539
Did you get a look at that ring he wears?

19:21.574 --> 19:23.665
- The guy was a Green Beret.
- So?

19:23.700 --> 19:25.890
You saw the crime scene.
It was a mess.

19:25.925 --> 19:29.221
That was a real struggle.
It must have gone on for three minutes.

19:29.256 --> 19:35.095
How could a 65-year-old man fight off
a former Green Beret?

19:35.130 --> 19:36.428
He didn't want to die.

19:36.463 --> 19:38.637
Good afternoon.
Thanks for coming.

19:39.683 --> 19:42.267
We gather today on this sad day...

19:42.302 --> 19:47.315
to say good-bye to our dear,
departed friend, Lou Pratt.

19:47.350 --> 19:51.443
That man who committed his life
to the principles of reason...

19:51.478 --> 19:56.406
has been taken from us
in such an unfair manner...

19:56.441 --> 20:00.576
Is irony in its most bitter form.

20:00.719 --> 20:07.834
Anyone who knew
this tough, hard-nosed attorney...

20:07.869 --> 20:12.967
knew Lou Pratt's most well-guarded secret.

20:13.002 --> 20:17.678
The man was a teddy bear.

20:17.713 --> 20:21.305
It is why many of you have come here today

20:21.340 --> 20:25.770
to say good-bye to a man
who was always there for you.

20:25.805 --> 20:27.438
As an attorney,

20:27.646 --> 20:31.442
Lou Pratt was a man who always
let you know where you stood.

20:31.477 --> 20:32.416
Excuse me.

20:32.451 --> 20:35.070
- Can I help you?
- Thanks. We're fine.

20:35.105 --> 20:39.534
Most of us preferred to stand with him
instead of against him.

20:39.569 --> 20:42.743
Sir, please!
Enough is enough!

20:42.952 --> 20:48.228
about Lou was his belief in the concept
of compromise. - Thank God.

20:48.263 --> 20:51.546
- And heaven help the man...
- Can you believe this guy?

20:51.581 --> 20:54.677
He's hacking up a lung.
A guy's got his limits, right?

20:54.712 --> 20:56.531
That was mine.

20:56.566 --> 20:58.611
I just couldn't help myself.

20:58.646 --> 21:01.461
Do you see how assertive you were?

21:01.496 --> 21:04.453
It actually does feel pretty good.

21:20.674 --> 21:22.398
Hey! You!

21:22.433 --> 21:23.899
You should be ashamed of yourself.

21:23.934 --> 21:25.986
I am, 24-7.

21:26.021 --> 21:28.006
Do you know what tomorrow is?

21:28.219 --> 21:29.184
Thursday.

21:29.219 --> 21:30.743
Tomorrow is my uncle's birthday.

21:30.778 --> 21:32.304
He would've been 90 years old.

21:32.339 --> 21:36.206
- Hey, he didn't mean to kill him.
- He was coughing on my neck.

21:36.241 --> 21:37.915
He was my hero.

21:41.025 --> 21:45.327
I could feel the spray
on the back of my neck.

21:45.362 --> 21:46.646
Monk!

21:47.756 --> 21:48.957
Where's Grayson?

21:48.992 --> 21:50.422
He's still inside.

21:50.457 --> 21:51.669
Monk doesn't think he did it.

21:51.704 --> 21:54.546
Oh, really?
Well, this should interest you.

21:54.581 --> 21:57.341
Grayson bought a bunch
of knives online a year ago

21:57.376 --> 21:59.216
that match the murder weapon.

21:59.970 --> 22:03.682
A million people buy knives online.

22:03.717 --> 22:06.116
And we know Grayson collects weapons.

22:06.151 --> 22:07.775
What do you got?

22:08.339 --> 22:11.167
"Something's wrong, Captain.
It doesn't make any sense, Captain."

22:11.202 --> 22:13.909
Huh? You got nothin', Monk.

22:14.979 --> 22:16.551
Grayson is the guy.

22:16.586 --> 22:19.089
If I had a farm, I'd bet it.

22:21.065 --> 22:23.974
- Let's go home. I need a shower.
- Who needs this?

22:28.320 --> 22:30.446
Okay, Sherman, let's go.
Come on!

22:32.391 --> 22:33.609
Sherman?

22:34.984 --> 22:36.540
Come on, boy. Come on!

22:36.575 --> 22:39.087
Let's go. Come on!

22:40.799 --> 22:42.070
Oh, no.

22:43.226 --> 22:47.204
Sherman! Come on.
Where are ya?

22:48.086 --> 22:50.723
Sher... Here, boy!

22:55.416 --> 22:56.582
Sherman?

22:57.260 --> 22:59.240
What are you doing in her garage?

23:01.908 --> 23:04.402
What's wrong, boy?
What's wrong?

23:04.437 --> 23:08.723
Sherman, what are you doing in here?

23:12.467 --> 23:14.454
What's going on in here?

23:26.222 --> 23:27.575
Adrian?

23:29.092 --> 23:30.485
Adrian?

23:35.031 --> 23:36.576
Hey.

23:38.053 --> 23:41.059
Hey yourself. How did you sleep?

23:41.094 --> 23:42.266
Mmm.

23:43.589 --> 23:46.185
You know, I don't think
she looks anything like me.

23:46.220 --> 23:48.423
That's what I've been saying.

23:48.458 --> 23:50.613
Are you attracted to her?

23:51.202 --> 23:52.668
Of course not.

23:53.553 --> 23:55.903
It's okay if you are.

23:56.147 --> 23:58.153
You're only human.

23:58.318 --> 24:00.093
I'm not attracted to her.

24:00.128 --> 24:03.148
Adrian Monk, you're the world's
greatest detective

24:03.183 --> 24:05.902
and the world's worst liar.

24:06.625 --> 24:10.645
Hello? Are you there?

24:10.871 --> 24:13.659
- Adrian, if you're there...
- Pick up the phone.

24:14.217 --> 24:16.636
Monk, hello?

24:17.959 --> 24:19.458
Where are you?

24:19.493 --> 24:22.034
If you're there, please pick up.

24:25.690 --> 24:28.221
- Hello?
- Oh, thank God.

24:28.256 --> 24:29.324
Monica?

24:29.359 --> 24:30.558
Grayson is dead.

24:30.593 --> 24:34.378
He was in my garage.
I found him.

24:34.930 --> 24:37.791
- I didn't know who else to call.
- It's okay. It's okay.

24:37.826 --> 24:41.105
They've been questioning me
for the last hour and a half.

24:43.090 --> 24:46.154
Adrian, what's happening?
Who's doing this?

24:46.189 --> 24:47.605
I don't know.

24:47.640 --> 24:49.842
They think I'm involved.

24:50.837 --> 24:52.717
Do you need a lawyer?

24:52.752 --> 24:55.807
I have a lawyer.
What I need is a friend.

24:58.129 --> 25:00.420
Stand back, ma'am.

25:03.133 --> 25:04.803
How'd that happen?

25:05.054 --> 25:07.396
She must've called him from the station.

25:08.520 --> 25:10.276
He's like a bad cold.

25:14.005 --> 25:16.442
Ma'am, could you excuse us, please?

25:16.477 --> 25:17.911
It's okay.

25:18.864 --> 25:19.969
Captain.

25:21.622 --> 25:22.726
How's your friend?

25:22.761 --> 25:24.112
She's a little upset.

25:24.147 --> 25:25.359
Yeah, I'll bet she is.

25:26.224 --> 25:30.334
Well, that's it for Grayson.
He's no longer a suspect.

25:30.369 --> 25:33.420
But I think we're
in the right neighborhood. - Uh-huh.

25:33.455 --> 25:36.108
Somebody used his dog to lure him in here.

25:36.758 --> 25:38.123
The murder weapon.

25:38.158 --> 25:39.764
He was struck from behind.

25:39.799 --> 25:42.148
- Any prints?
- No. Negative on the shovel.

25:42.183 --> 25:44.080
Negative on the dog collar too.

25:44.115 --> 25:45.934
Probably wearing gloves.

25:45.969 --> 25:47.447
Please don't touch that.

25:47.607 --> 25:48.941
Any ideas, Monk?

25:48.976 --> 25:50.329
'Cause I have a few.

25:50.364 --> 25:53.114
- Most of'em involve your girlfriend.
- She's not...

25:53.149 --> 25:56.175
She has means, motive.
They've been feuding for years.

25:56.210 --> 25:57.631
And threatening each other.

25:57.666 --> 25:59.412
Now he turns up dead in her garage.

25:59.447 --> 26:02.049
He's dead. The lawyer's dead.
Lawyer's secretary's dead.

26:02.084 --> 26:03.329
A whole lot of dead people.

26:03.364 --> 26:06.421
That light... with the motion detectors.

26:06.456 --> 26:08.045
It's all smashed.

26:08.080 --> 26:10.387
Yeah. Probably with the shovel.

26:10.422 --> 26:12.130
Our killer preferred to work in the dark.

26:12.165 --> 26:14.055
Why didn't he just turn it off?

26:14.374 --> 26:17.999
No, the killer couldn't find the switch.

26:18.034 --> 26:20.146
Why? Because he'd never been
in the garage before.

26:20.181 --> 26:24.440
Or she was hiding near the light,
it came on,

26:24.475 --> 26:27.332
she freaked out and
she smashed it with the shovel.

26:27.480 --> 26:29.182
That's possible, Monk.

26:29.442 --> 26:31.131
- Isn't that possible?
- It's possible.

26:31.166 --> 26:32.445
Yes. Here's the situation.

26:32.480 --> 26:35.609
Your friend Monica Waters is
a suspect in three homicides.

26:35.644 --> 26:36.601
Oh, no, no, no.

26:36.636 --> 26:39.399
Yes. Monk, you're not seeing this clearly.

26:39.434 --> 26:42.177
You're too close to her.
You've got a big blind spot.

26:42.212 --> 26:45.135
- I just don't...
- Adrian, listen to me.

26:45.384 --> 26:47.773
She is not Trudy.

26:56.592 --> 26:59.999
Miss Waters, your garage is
an active crime scene.

27:00.034 --> 27:01.635
It's off limits. Understood?

27:01.670 --> 27:02.516
Yeah.

27:03.262 --> 27:05.472
You're not planning
on leaving town, are you?

27:06.110 --> 27:08.231
No. - Good.

27:10.443 --> 27:13.521
Adrian, what's going on?
Am I a suspect?

27:13.556 --> 27:15.634
They're just...
They're just doing their job.

27:15.669 --> 27:18.719
I can't believe this is happening.
What if they're still out there?

27:18.754 --> 27:20.849
What if I'm next?
Well, I can't stay here alone.

27:20.884 --> 27:23.140
What the hell am I supposed to do?

27:23.647 --> 27:27.187
I could stay here... tonight.

27:28.230 --> 27:29.950
You would do that?

27:32.916 --> 27:35.820
Can I have a sleepover?

27:39.031 --> 27:40.825
First aid kit...

27:40.860 --> 27:43.708
and toothbrush.

27:43.743 --> 27:45.246
Backup toothbrushes.

27:45.281 --> 27:47.872
Backup bristles for
the backup toothbrushes.

27:47.907 --> 27:50.085
I am not coming to get you
in the middle of the night.

27:50.120 --> 27:53.337
You won't have to get me.
I'm not a child, Sharona.

27:54.422 --> 27:56.883
I can't find my P. J.'s.

27:58.346 --> 27:59.679
Gently.

28:09.396 --> 28:13.441
Adrian, I don't have
a good feeling about her.

28:13.476 --> 28:14.902
Underwear.

28:14.937 --> 28:16.780
Four pair should be enough.

28:16.909 --> 28:20.864
- I think she's dangerous.
- I think you're jealous.

28:20.899 --> 28:24.369
I am not jealous.
I am scared.

28:24.404 --> 28:25.744
Three people are dead.

28:25.779 --> 28:29.248
The only danger I'm in tonight is
running out of talcum powder.

28:29.283 --> 28:31.083
Oh! Talcum powder.

28:47.305 --> 28:48.851
Hello?

28:49.521 --> 28:51.186
Hi.

28:53.730 --> 28:56.750
Uh, I'm right down the hall,
and this is you.

28:56.785 --> 28:58.904
Right down the hall? Wow!

28:58.939 --> 29:01.338
Wow, this is a great room.

29:01.373 --> 29:04.589
This is Derrick's...
This was Derrick's study.

29:05.241 --> 29:08.414
- Moist towelettes. You didn't have to.
- So you're all right, then?

29:08.449 --> 29:11.248
Are you kidding? I may never leave.

29:11.417 --> 29:14.211
I mean, you know...

29:14.667 --> 29:17.884
Uh, the couch folds out,
and there are clean sheets.

29:17.919 --> 29:19.838
Oh, I brought my own.

29:19.873 --> 29:21.884
Adrian, I have sheets.

29:21.919 --> 29:25.877
Well, as long as I brought my own,
I might as well... might as well use them.

29:25.912 --> 29:27.606
It's no big deal.

29:27.641 --> 29:31.280
Um, the only thing
I need is a pillowcase.

29:34.580 --> 29:36.537
- Pillowcases.
- That's a lot of pillowcases.

29:36.572 --> 29:38.738
Yeah. Derrick never used
the same one twice.

29:38.773 --> 29:39.886
That must have been hard...

29:39.921 --> 29:42.083
- living with somebody like that.
- Yes..

29:42.118 --> 29:43.927
and-and no.

29:47.863 --> 29:49.814
I'll put them here for you.

29:50.305 --> 29:51.971
Well, dinner's about ready.
I hope you're hungry.

29:52.006 --> 29:54.641
Oh, yeah. I'll just, uh...

29:54.991 --> 30:00.599
I'll-I'll be right with you.
I just want to, uh, go and freshen up.

30:00.634 --> 30:01.538
Okay.

30:14.015 --> 30:16.752
Captain! Captain, look at this.

30:16.787 --> 30:19.477
Derrick Waters, Monica's ex-husband.

30:19.512 --> 30:20.731
Give me a quarter.

30:23.173 --> 30:24.724
His credit cards were never canceled.

30:24.759 --> 30:26.877
The last thing he bought was on March 11.

30:26.912 --> 30:29.273
- Then he just disappeared.
- March 11.

30:29.308 --> 30:31.463
When did she start building that garage?

30:34.217 --> 30:36.071
March 14, same year.

30:38.477 --> 30:41.271
Son of a bitch.
He's under the garage.

30:42.041 --> 30:43.211
Should we call Monk?

30:43.246 --> 30:45.227
No. Let him read about it in the paper.

30:45.800 --> 30:47.613
- Maybe we should call him.
- Why?

30:47.648 --> 30:49.885
I just talked to Sharona. He's there.

30:52.054 --> 30:53.052
He's where?

31:01.731 --> 31:02.937
Monica?

31:04.599 --> 31:05.879
Monica?

31:06.743 --> 31:08.056
There you are.

31:08.091 --> 31:10.133
- Oh. Should we eat?
- Are you okay?

31:10.168 --> 31:11.656
Fine. Let's eat.

31:12.431 --> 31:16.171
Adrian, you were in the bathroom for,
like, two hours.

31:16.661 --> 31:18.061
I don't think so.

31:19.448 --> 31:20.999
It's 9:30.

31:22.180 --> 31:24.201
I don't think so.

31:24.637 --> 31:27.387
I knocked on the door, like, five times.

31:28.974 --> 31:29.964
You did?

31:29.999 --> 31:31.754
You kept saying,
"Just a minute."

31:31.789 --> 31:34.874
I did? - Then you recited the lyrics to
"Duke of Earl."

31:34.909 --> 31:36.826
Really?

31:36.861 --> 31:39.432
I guess I'm a little nervous.

31:39.467 --> 31:43.839
And then for, like, 20 minutes,
you were gargling or something.

31:44.626 --> 31:45.996
Sorry.

31:47.137 --> 31:48.997
Why don't I pour you a glass of wine?

31:49.032 --> 31:51.329
It's certainly had a chance to breathe.

31:58.389 --> 31:59.318
Hello?

31:59.353 --> 32:01.887
Monk, it's me.
Get out of there.

32:01.922 --> 32:03.894
What? - Listen to me.
She's a killer.

32:03.929 --> 32:07.287
You're in danger.
Get out of the house.

32:14.222 --> 32:15.876
What did you say?

32:15.911 --> 32:18.189
She is a killer, Monk.
Get out of there.

32:18.224 --> 32:20.394
- Who is it?
- Sharona.

32:20.429 --> 32:22.081
Is she standing right there?

32:22.640 --> 32:23.995
That's right.

32:24.030 --> 32:24.795
Listen to me.

32:24.830 --> 32:27.065
Her husband disappeared two years ago.

32:27.100 --> 32:29.436
Two days later,
she started building the garage.

32:29.471 --> 32:32.319
Monk, she killed him.
She buried him under the garage.

32:32.354 --> 32:35.235
We're getting a court order tonight.
We're gonna dig him up in the morning.

32:35.270 --> 32:36.802
Of course I'll be there.

32:36.837 --> 32:38.570
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

32:38.605 --> 32:40.839
Just get out of there, okay?

32:43.049 --> 32:44.235
Bye.

32:45.948 --> 32:47.871
That was Sharona.

32:47.906 --> 32:50.290
Her son got the lead in the school play.

32:50.325 --> 32:52.089
Oh, really? What play?

32:53.134 --> 32:54.760
Gandhi.

32:55.183 --> 32:57.561
Gandhi? Is that a play?

32:57.596 --> 33:01.060
I think they added a few songs.

33:01.095 --> 33:02.039
You wanna come?

33:02.074 --> 33:04.991
Oh, I think I'll be having
a headache that night.

33:06.231 --> 33:08.055
To new friends.

33:21.826 --> 33:25.204
Well, I've been keeping dinner warm
in the kitchen.

33:34.309 --> 33:35.349
Are you all right?

33:35.384 --> 33:37.384
Yes. Perfect.

33:39.805 --> 33:42.756
I love these dishes.
They were my grandmother's.

33:42.791 --> 33:47.034
When I was four years old, she told me
I could have them when she died.

33:47.460 --> 33:49.517
I said I can't wait.

34:08.476 --> 34:09.953
You're not eating.

34:09.987 --> 34:12.435
I ate in the bathroom.

34:13.492 --> 34:15.868
I had some mints.

34:15.902 --> 34:18.561
Try my salad.
I made the dressing myself.

34:18.596 --> 34:19.920
Okay.

34:32.284 --> 34:35.969
Mmm. Mm-mm. Delicious.

34:36.005 --> 34:37.665
You didn't taste it.

34:38.590 --> 34:41.185
Sure I did.
And it's very good.

34:41.219 --> 34:44.379
No, you didn't. Open your mouth.
Let me see.

34:51.801 --> 34:54.741
Okay. I promise I won't be upset.

34:54.775 --> 34:56.467
Just tell me the truth.

34:57.175 --> 34:58.777
Are you trying to kill me?

34:58.812 --> 35:00.894
- What?
- It's okay if you are.

35:00.929 --> 35:03.036
L-I just need to know.

35:05.499 --> 35:07.266
Is this poisoned?

35:07.664 --> 35:09.488
Do you think I could hurt you?

35:09.523 --> 35:11.480
He's under the garage, isn't he?

35:11.515 --> 35:12.854
- Who is?
- Your ex-husband.

35:12.889 --> 35:14.365
You buried him under the garage.

35:14.400 --> 35:17.937
- How could you say that?
- Everybody's saying it.

35:22.112 --> 35:29.515
My husband, Derrick,
is a schizophrenic.

35:29.550 --> 35:34.062
He had a complete breakdown two
years ago. He's in a private institution.

35:34.097 --> 35:38.166
We've been trying to keep it a secret.
He didn't want his family to know.

35:38.680 --> 35:40.840
Oh, my God!

35:42.233 --> 35:44.800
He's in Zurich, isn't he?

35:44.835 --> 35:47.459
At the Breinnhoff Clinic?

35:47.717 --> 35:48.865
How did you know that?

35:48.900 --> 35:51.611
It's the best hospital in the world
for psychological disorders.

35:51.646 --> 35:54.628
I'd be there myself, but I don't fly.

35:54.663 --> 35:58.775
Oh. - And you have soap
from different hotels in Zurich.

35:58.810 --> 36:02.689
I assumed you liked to take ski vacations.

36:09.976 --> 36:12.261
Who is it?
Who's there?

36:14.114 --> 36:15.877
I've got a gun.

36:16.547 --> 36:19.193
No, you don't, Monk.

36:19.581 --> 36:21.656
Captain.
Captain, listen.

36:21.691 --> 36:23.809
- You don't want to do this.
- What is that? Pepper spray?

36:23.844 --> 36:27.144
Let me explain.
Look, you don't want to do this!

36:27.179 --> 36:29.180
Hold him. Charley, hold him.

36:29.215 --> 36:31.393
Ma'am, we're in the process
of getting a warrant.

36:31.428 --> 36:33.545
- We're gonna dig up your garage.
- Why?

36:33.580 --> 36:34.672
I think you know why.

36:34.707 --> 36:36.256
Captain, before you say another word,

36:36.291 --> 36:38.306
Derrick Waters is not buried
under that garage.

36:38.341 --> 36:41.824
He's in Zurich. He's in a private clinic.
He's been there for two years.

36:42.015 --> 36:45.384
In Zurich? - Yes. I have a number
if you want to verify it.

36:45.419 --> 36:46.822
In Zurich?

36:48.283 --> 36:50.079
Really?

36:53.295 --> 36:55.590
So where does that leave us?

36:55.625 --> 36:57.584
We're back at square one.

37:04.487 --> 37:07.109
Thank you. Thank you very much.

37:08.642 --> 37:10.675
Welcome to square one.

37:10.710 --> 37:14.248
What are we doing here?
I know you told me, but I didn't listen.

37:14.283 --> 37:15.680
Okay, one more time.

37:15.715 --> 37:18.454
- The burnt file.
- What?

37:18.653 --> 37:21.753
- Grayson's file. The burnt file.
- Oh. Mm-hmm.

37:21.788 --> 37:25.163
Oh, God. It had nothing
to do with anything.

37:25.198 --> 37:27.325
Absolutely nothing.

37:27.653 --> 37:30.176
- It was a decoy.
- A decoy?

37:30.211 --> 37:35.625
The real answer is in
one of these other files.

37:35.660 --> 37:37.083
Oh, you have to be joking.

37:37.118 --> 37:40.560
If I was joking, it would certainly
be a lot funnier than this.

37:45.226 --> 37:48.197
We-We can't read all of this.

37:48.232 --> 37:49.699
Look at this!

37:50.503 --> 37:53.947
- Oh, this is gonna take forever.
- Better get started.

37:53.982 --> 37:58.430
We have to think of something else.
This is ridiculous.

37:58.465 --> 37:59.452
Wait!

38:00.648 --> 38:02.713
- What?
- Wait a minute.

38:21.704 --> 38:25.148
"Thomas Katterskill."
Who's that?

38:25.183 --> 38:26.633
That's our guy.

38:30.391 --> 38:35.473
"To my beloved grandchildren, I leave
$2.4 million to be divided between you.

38:35.508 --> 38:40.019
And the balance of my estate,
totaling more than $97 million,

38:40.054 --> 38:44.088
I leave to my alma mater,
Westmore University."

38:44.123 --> 38:48.019
- Excuse me?
- My alma mater, Westmore University.

38:48.054 --> 38:49.399
No, no, no. Wait a minute.

38:49.434 --> 38:51.316
This is a joke.
There's something wrong.

38:51.351 --> 38:53.198
Well, son, I know it's a bit unorthodox...

38:53.233 --> 38:55.854
No. It's wrong.

38:55.889 --> 38:59.096
This is not the right will.
He left everything to me.

38:59.131 --> 39:01.259
How do you know that, Todd?

39:03.566 --> 39:05.215
I know you.

39:05.250 --> 39:07.545
You were at the memorial service.

39:07.580 --> 39:09.450
This is your uncle's will.

39:10.218 --> 39:13.211
Actually, it's a forgery
of your uncle's will.

39:13.246 --> 39:16.895
But this is what you expected
to hear today, isn't it?

39:18.167 --> 39:20.745
I don't know what you're talking about.

39:21.782 --> 39:25.347
It's dated October 4, kid.
You screwed up.

39:25.382 --> 39:27.253
The notary public who was
supposed to have signed this

39:27.288 --> 39:30.172
was on a cruise in the Caribbean
on October 4.

39:30.207 --> 39:32.676
We were in the file room yesterday.

39:35.157 --> 39:38.156
You see the little tabs at the top?

39:38.191 --> 39:40.420
Some are on the left, some on the right,
some in the middle.

39:40.455 --> 39:42.811
Mr. Pratt had a system.

39:42.846 --> 39:45.037
When he put files away,
he alternated them

39:45.072 --> 39:48.486
left, right, middle...
so they'd be easier to read.

39:48.521 --> 39:53.097
And they were all arranged like that,
except for this one.

39:53.132 --> 39:57.264
It's a middle, and it was right
behind another middle.

39:57.299 --> 39:59.412
We all assumed that
the killer broke in here

39:59.447 --> 40:03.622
to burn a file or to steal a file,
but we were wrong.

40:04.344 --> 40:08.132
The killer broke in to add a file.

40:09.747 --> 40:11.366
Here's what happened.

40:11.401 --> 40:16.050
Your uncle was dying, and you knew
you'd been cut out of the will.

40:16.085 --> 40:18.619
So you wrote up a phony will,

40:18.654 --> 40:20.865
where you inherited everything.

40:21.610 --> 40:24.327
And, of course, you had to kill Lou Pratt.
He was your uncle's attorney,

40:24.362 --> 40:27.170
and he would've spotted the forgery.

40:27.205 --> 40:29.937
And after you killed him and his assistant,

40:29.972 --> 40:33.206
you put the phony will in the file,
but you couldn'tjust stop there.

40:33.241 --> 40:37.084
The cops would've wondered,
"Why was Lou Pratt murdered?"

40:37.119 --> 40:39.914
And they would've gone through
every one ofhis files,

40:39.949 --> 40:43.409
and eventually they would have
found your phony will.

40:43.444 --> 40:45.598
So you had to send them
down the wrong road,

40:45.633 --> 40:47.805
and any wrong road would do.

40:48.330 --> 40:51.772
You picked a file at random,
and you burned it.

40:51.807 --> 40:54.452
And it worked. Everybody was
concentrating on Grayson

40:54.487 --> 40:57.156
and Monica Waters
and the disputed garage.

40:57.191 --> 41:00.861
But when you overheard me
at the funeral, you got scared.

41:00.896 --> 41:04.229
Because you knew I was having
serious doubts about Grayson.

41:04.264 --> 41:09.259
So you killed him to push us
even further down that wrong road.

41:11.712 --> 41:12.855
Oh!

41:18.094 --> 41:21.702
I forgot to mention we brought
Mr. Grayson's dog with us.

41:21.737 --> 41:23.855
It looks like he remembers you.

41:38.000 --> 41:38.987
It's okay.

41:40.013 --> 41:41.034
Hey, Monk.

41:46.125 --> 41:47.751
I'm sorry.

41:47.786 --> 41:49.602
You don't have to say that.

41:49.637 --> 41:51.087
Yes, I do.

41:51.122 --> 41:53.177
The commissioner is making me.

41:54.931 --> 41:56.303
Adrian?

42:03.263 --> 42:05.534
Is it really over?

42:06.266 --> 42:07.592
I knew you could do it.

42:07.627 --> 42:09.513
Monica, I...

42:09.813 --> 42:10.833
- I, uh...
- I just wanted...

42:10.868 --> 42:15.831
I just have to... Go ahead.
I'm sorry. You go.

42:16.086 --> 42:18.599
I just wanted to say...

42:19.437 --> 42:22.690
you're an extraordinary man.

42:23.820 --> 42:25.646
I had just about given up,

42:25.681 --> 42:32.675
but spending time with you reminded me
of how things were with Derrick and I...

42:32.710 --> 42:35.738
how I want us to be again.

42:35.773 --> 42:39.080
I'm flying off to Zurich this week,

42:39.115 --> 42:42.742
but I won't be coming home
until he's better.

42:43.434 --> 42:45.715
He's a lucky man,

42:47.245 --> 42:49.611
Brace yourself, Monk.

42:49.646 --> 42:52.054
I'm gonna kiss you good-bye.
