00:31.960 --> 00:34.725
You think this is cute, don't you?

00:34.800 --> 00:38.009
You think there's a real connection there.

00:38.120 --> 00:40.726
So you feed it,

00:40.800 --> 00:42.848
you dress it up.

00:46.920 --> 00:48.570
But a cat doesn't care if you live or die

00:48.640 --> 00:51.450
as long as someone
gives it Friskies twice a day.

01:00.760 --> 01:04.970
But people are so desperate
for someone to hold onto

01:05.040 --> 01:06.929
they'll take whatever they can get.

01:07.640 --> 01:10.405
I found him on the street,
months after the accident

01:10.480 --> 01:12.528
and I dress him like Masao.

01:12.600 --> 01:16.161
I know my son has come back
to me in this cat.

01:16.320 --> 01:19.802
But no matter how lonely you are,

01:19.880 --> 01:23.168
a cat is not a person.

01:45.400 --> 01:47.846
Okay. Super helpful, uh...

01:47.960 --> 01:51.043
Oh, so marketing wants
sign-off on the new billboard.

01:51.880 --> 01:53.405
What do you think?

01:53.480 --> 01:55.369
It might be a little
heavy on the Photoshop.

01:55.440 --> 01:56.487
Get me a real F-16.

01:56.560 --> 01:57.696
We'll take some real pictures.

01:57.720 --> 01:59.496
No, they said they don't
have the budget for it.

01:59.520 --> 02:00.885
Fire the marketing department!

02:00.960 --> 02:03.247
You wanna fire the entire
marketing department?

02:03.320 --> 02:06.290
No. I wanna fly a real F-16. What's next?

02:06.360 --> 02:08.009
I'm supposed to remind you,

02:08.080 --> 02:09.320
Lara's left two messages.

02:09.440 --> 02:10.884
Why is she calling?

02:10.960 --> 02:12.485
Because she's your wife.

02:12.560 --> 02:14.927
I put together some talking points

02:15.000 --> 02:16.331
for your press conference.

02:16.400 --> 02:17.686
How old are you again?

02:17.760 --> 02:18.807
Twenty-eight.

02:18.880 --> 02:19.976
That's how long I've been
talking to the press.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.001
I'll be fine.

02:21.080 --> 02:22.127
Sir, we're ready.

02:24.080 --> 02:25.684
Why don't you jump with me today?

02:25.760 --> 02:28.206
Oh, yeah, no. I just had breakfast, so...

02:28.320 --> 02:29.401
Come on!

02:29.840 --> 02:31.683
Dad, I can't. I can't.

02:32.360 --> 02:33.691
All right.

02:34.320 --> 02:37.563
Chicken!

02:41.640 --> 02:43.165
Good one, Dad.

03:01.280 --> 03:02.281
Yeah!

03:02.360 --> 03:03.771
Very nice, very nice!

03:05.120 --> 03:06.451
Perfect landing.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.851
Thank you.

03:07.920 --> 03:10.605
Thank you very much. Thank you.

03:10.880 --> 03:12.120
Good morning, everyone.

03:12.200 --> 03:13.361
What an incredible view.

03:13.440 --> 03:16.330
And I mean all of you that I get
to look at this fine morning.

03:16.400 --> 03:17.686
Thank you for coming.

03:17.800 --> 03:19.404
Now, when we open this building

03:19.480 --> 03:20.891
one month from today.

03:21.080 --> 03:23.924
The FireBrand Tower will be the tallest
building in North America.

03:24.120 --> 03:26.361
And that means that we can
finally move out of that dump

03:26.440 --> 03:28.656
we've all been forced to work in
all these years down the block.

03:28.680 --> 03:29.841
Tell us about Chicago.

03:29.920 --> 03:32.366
Mr. Brand, any comment
on the Paragon Tower?

03:32.520 --> 03:34.568
Oh, you mean that tin shack
they're gluing together

03:34.640 --> 03:35.766
over there in Chicago?

03:35.840 --> 03:36.887
No. No comment on that.</font>

03:36.960 --> 03:39.008
Rumor is they're beating you by 60 feet.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.164
Well, no. There's not a chance of that.

03:41.280 --> 03:43.160
No, no. Look, I'd love to
answer more questions,

03:43.200 --> 03:44.645
but I gotta get back to the office.

03:47.600 --> 03:49.284
All right. I wanna move fast here.

03:49.360 --> 03:51.044
Have legal review this overnight.

03:51.160 --> 03:52.844
They're all tied up with the tower.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.600
Listen, I know we got to keep him happy,

03:54.640 --> 03:56.600
but we can't let this building
distract us from...

03:56.640 --> 03:58.244
Why? You've got something better to do?

03:58.600 --> 03:59.601
Oh.

03:59.680 --> 04:00.920
How was the press conference?

04:01.000 --> 04:02.889
Well, apparently it was a distraction.

04:02.960 --> 04:05.531
I pulled some staff to explore
a public offering.

04:05.640 --> 04:08.041
I'm sorry.
Did I ask you to sell my company?

04:08.160 --> 04:09.241
Are we taking bids?

04:09.320 --> 04:10.480
How much can we get for Gary?

04:11.840 --> 04:12.936
We ran some rough numbers...

04:12.960 --> 04:15.176
Yeah. Well, first, why is the press
asking me about Chicago?

04:15.200 --> 04:16.928
You're winning. Yours is bigger.

04:17.040 --> 04:19.519
Well, finally there's our new slogan.

04:19.600 --> 04:21.160
Where are we with the opening ceremony?

04:21.200 --> 04:23.200
We're gonna rig the entire
building with fireworks.

04:23.320 --> 04:25.209
Oh, so, wait. When I cut the ribbon...

04:25.280 --> 04:26.281
Fireworks go off.

04:26.360 --> 04:28.488
Oh, my God. Ian, that is just spectacular,

04:28.560 --> 04:31.040
you know, if we were doing
a Fourth of July celebration

04:31.120 --> 04:32.565
or a really rousing Oktoberfest.

04:32.640 --> 04:33.721
Tom, we can't keep...

04:33.800 --> 04:35.370
Look, we are just about to cap off

04:35.440 --> 04:37.283
the tallest building
in the Northern Hemisphere

04:37.360 --> 04:39.681
and I can't brag about it
if I don't own it.

04:39.840 --> 04:40.841
Yeah.

04:40.920 --> 04:43.207
This is the distraction.

04:44.560 --> 04:48.326
Okay, everybody,
let's pretend that that didn't just happen.

05:03.960 --> 05:05.240
- What's that?
- It's a surprise.

05:05.280 --> 05:06.281
For my birthday?

05:07.560 --> 05:09.289
- What are you watching?
- Dad.

05:09.960 --> 05:11.644
Did he tell you to record this?

05:11.800 --> 05:13.325
No, but I just wanted to see him.

05:13.400 --> 05:14.526
Look. Watch.

05:14.720 --> 05:16.927
And that means that we can
finally move out of that dump

05:17.000 --> 05:18.331
we've all been forced to work in

05:18.400 --> 05:19.925
all these years down the block.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.090
How many times have you watched this?

05:22.400 --> 05:23.400
Um...

05:23.440 --> 05:24.441
Eighty-three.

05:24.880 --> 05:26.291
And now it's 84.

05:26.520 --> 05:27.965
We're worried about costs.

05:28.040 --> 05:30.361
Well, that's why we call this
a "Board meeting."

05:32.360 --> 05:33.646
Please take a message.

05:33.720 --> 05:35.722
- Tom, these are serious concerns.
- I know.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.325
- Look, I understand...
- Lara Brand.

05:39.280 --> 05:41.851
- Lara Brand.
- Oh, no, go ahead. Just take it outside.

05:45.120 --> 05:47.248
Ian, where's Tom?
I can't get ahold of him.

05:47.320 --> 05:48.970
I can't pry him away from the Board.

05:49.040 --> 05:52.931
I wanna show you all that I take
your concerns very seriously.

05:53.040 --> 05:55.691
Our operating costs
are up 30% from last quarter.

05:55.760 --> 05:59.970
And my first concern is why is Ian
coming at us with this IPO crap?

06:00.080 --> 06:01.376
He's been with the Board all day?

06:01.400 --> 06:02.656
It's hard to get Tom's attention.

06:02.680 --> 06:03.886
Maybe I should join the Board.

06:03.960 --> 06:06.361
Or you can take my job. Please.

06:06.440 --> 06:08.204
Ian approached us with the idea.

06:08.280 --> 06:10.487
He's put together
a very attractive proposal.

06:10.640 --> 06:13.120
A public offering means
a big payday for all of us.

06:13.280 --> 06:16.124
Now, we've sunk years of revenue
into that building, Tom.

06:16.200 --> 06:17.486
It's time to cash out.

06:17.640 --> 06:19.927
Come on, we got plenty of cash, don't we?

06:20.000 --> 06:21.001
And why?

06:21.080 --> 06:23.970
Because we built airlines and retail
chains and phone companies,

06:24.040 --> 06:26.168
but no one is gonna remember any of those

06:26.320 --> 06:27.651
because they keep changing hands.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.404
But 100 years from now,

06:29.480 --> 06:31.960
when people look out their windows
and they see that tower,

06:32.040 --> 06:33.883
they're gonna see the name "Brand"

06:33.960 --> 06:35.769
and that's a name they will never forget.

06:35.840 --> 06:39.128
And that is not something
that I am willing to sell.

06:39.200 --> 06:41.328
We're not running a charity
for your ego, Tom.

06:41.480 --> 06:43.642
Okay. Well, then instead,
let's play a little game.

06:43.720 --> 06:45.324
You know, just for the fun of it.

06:45.520 --> 06:49.161
Raise your hand if your name
is on the company letterhead.

06:49.360 --> 06:51.296
- Tom...
- No, no. Come on, we'll just call it a vote.

06:51.320 --> 06:54.164
- Tom...
- Fifty-one percent!

06:54.240 --> 06:55.924
Feels good to win.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.684
You can sell shares at my funeral.

06:57.760 --> 07:00.047
And the next time Ian wants to play CEO,

07:01.160 --> 07:03.401
we can fire him together.</font>

07:03.880 --> 07:05.803
- Hey, can I borrow you for a minute?
- Not now.

07:05.920 --> 07:07.570
It's about the tower.

07:11.760 --> 07:14.136
I already talked to your dad about this.
We're 100 feet taller.

07:14.160 --> 07:15.176
I know that's the projection.

07:15.200 --> 07:16.320
But that's printed to scale.

07:16.360 --> 07:17.691
Chicago's beating us by 60.

07:17.760 --> 07:19.016
Am I missing something here? We're taller.

07:19.040 --> 07:20.690
There's too much steel in their roof.

07:20.840 --> 07:21.841
So?

07:22.000 --> 07:24.685
So that's rated for 760 tons,
and there's nothing on it.

07:24.760 --> 07:26.160
But if they laid that much steel...

07:27.680 --> 07:28.761
They're not done.

07:28.840 --> 07:29.936
No, that's not in their plans.

07:29.960 --> 07:31.016
They know we have their plans.

07:31.040 --> 07:33.456
They want us to think we're winning
but they got a permit for that

07:33.480 --> 07:34.925
and they are beating us by 60 feet.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.365
David!

07:36.480 --> 07:38.209
Right. Keep this quiet.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.721
Oh, Ian, let's make that call
to Madrid before they take their siesta.

07:43.760 --> 07:44.921
Absolutely.

07:45.640 --> 07:47.529
You know, we do have janitors.

07:47.640 --> 07:49.440
- Yeah. I've been busy.
- I got you something.

07:49.560 --> 07:50.561
Ow!

07:58.640 --> 07:59.926
Thanks, Dad.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.926
I'm sorry to break up your dinner,
but I need that report.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.002
Well, tell your wife the check's on me.

08:11.080 --> 08:13.765
Yeah, but she gets another
anniversary next year.

08:13.840 --> 08:15.285
I don't really care.

08:17.160 --> 08:19.242
Oh, excuse me,
have you seen my wife anywhere?

08:19.320 --> 08:20.526
What does she look like?

08:20.600 --> 08:24.844
She is the most beautiful woman
in the entire world.

08:24.920 --> 08:27.048
Oh, well, maybe I have seen her.
Let me see.

08:28.440 --> 08:30.568
Oh, here we go. Is this her?

08:31.440 --> 08:32.851
Oh, let's give her a call.

08:32.919 --> 08:35.366
Yeah, it was a busy day. What did I miss?

08:36.480 --> 08:37.924
Uh, my birthday was last month.

08:38.120 --> 08:39.610
You're joking me right now?

08:39.799 --> 08:42.039
You're gonna have to give me
more to work with than that.

08:43.960 --> 08:46.042
- Oh, damn it. It's not today?
- Tomorrow.

08:46.120 --> 08:47.531
Oh, well, then I haven't missed it.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.045
Father of the year.

08:49.120 --> 08:50.485
So, what did we get her?

08:50.560 --> 08:51.776
Oh, we didn't get her anything.

08:51.800 --> 08:55.725
You were too busy to talk for five minutes,
so I got her a makeup kit.

08:55.880 --> 08:58.929
Oh, well, couldn't we say that
the makeup kit's from both of us?

08:59.000 --> 09:00.923
- No.
- Fine.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.127
What should I get her?

09:02.760 --> 09:05.001
Maybe you should ask her what she wants.

09:05.080 --> 09:06.570
Try getting to know her a little bit

09:06.640 --> 09:08.085
before she heads off to college.

09:08.240 --> 09:10.163
Come on. I still got seven years left.

09:10.320 --> 09:12.288
Or, no, six years. I'm kidding.</font>

09:12.520 --> 09:13.851
Is this how you raised David?

09:13.920 --> 09:15.524
- My son turned out just fine.
- Mmm.

09:15.600 --> 09:17.648
He had to apply for a job to see his dad.

09:17.720 --> 09:19.216
Well, of course.
His mother got full custody.

09:19.240 --> 09:20.241
I had a terrible lawyer.

09:20.320 --> 09:21.731
When you come to Rebecca's party...

09:21.800 --> 09:24.256
Look, we are a month away from opening
the tallest building in...

09:24.280 --> 09:26.931
Tom! When you come to Rebecca's party,

09:27.000 --> 09:29.970
you gotta be here and you have
to bring an exceptional gift.

09:30.080 --> 09:31.161
Daddy!

09:31.320 --> 09:33.448
Hey, baby.

09:33.640 --> 09:36.291
Oh, my goodness.
Those are such fancy pajamas.

09:36.360 --> 09:37.361
Yeah, aren't they?

09:37.480 --> 09:38.925
- They're not pajamas.
- They're not?

09:39.000 --> 09:41.040
But isn't it your bedtime?
What time is her bedtime?

09:41.200 --> 09:42.486
She's coming with us.

09:42.680 --> 09:44.000
Mom says I get to meet the Mayor.

09:44.040 --> 09:45.041
Really?

09:45.520 --> 09:47.363
Quality father-daughter bonding time.

09:48.160 --> 09:49.685
Will there be food?

09:49.840 --> 09:50.921
It's $10,000 a plate.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.056
You're gonna eat like a queen.

09:52.080 --> 09:53.491
Will there be pizza?

09:53.560 --> 09:55.608
Yes, $10,000 pizza.

09:59.400 --> 10:02.370
The children's fund has thrived
under the Mayor's leadership.

10:02.560 --> 10:05.245
And to make sure Mayor Edwards
gets something out of it,

10:05.320 --> 10:07.049
he's gonna lower the voting age to ten.

10:08.480 --> 10:10.801
Everyone asks me why my husband

10:10.920 --> 10:13.048
is hosting a charity event.

10:13.120 --> 10:15.521
The truth is Tom loves children.

10:15.640 --> 10:17.642
He says they make the best smartphones.

10:18.120 --> 10:19.360
I don't get it.

10:19.400 --> 10:20.925
- She just burned your dad.
- Oh.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.764
They say there is no substitute

10:22.840 --> 10:24.444
for time with your children.

10:24.560 --> 10:27.484
Although, we know, in this room,
money comes close.

10:29.480 --> 10:31.926
And that's why this charity is so popular.

10:32.040 --> 10:33.451
If you don't have time for kids,

10:33.520 --> 10:35.200
we'll ease your guilt
by taking your dough.

10:36.320 --> 10:39.961
Which is why Tom Brand has agreed
to host this benefit

10:40.040 --> 10:42.122
for the next seven years.

10:44.200 --> 10:47.010
So without further ado,
please welcome my husband,

10:47.080 --> 10:49.048
a real pussy cat, Tom Brand.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.488
So, today is the big day.

10:55.560 --> 10:57.016
Have you thought about what you want?

10:57.040 --> 10:58.166
I want a cat.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.536
Oh, I don't think our building takes pets.

10:59.560 --> 11:00.721
You own the building.

11:00.800 --> 11:02.256
Wait, didn't you ask for a cat last year?</font>

11:02.280 --> 11:04.169
Yeah, and you got me a foosball table.

11:04.240 --> 11:06.096
Honey, most kids would kill
for a foosball table.

11:06.120 --> 11:07.776
Yeah, but none of my friends
play foosball.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.920
So, at least if I have a cat,
I can play with the cat.

11:09.960 --> 11:11.536
All right, all right.
I'll make you a deal.

11:11.560 --> 11:13.881
- I will think about it. How about that?
- Yes!

11:16.160 --> 11:17.600
Get her jewelry. Girls love jewelry.

11:17.640 --> 11:18.696
Pull some strings with Apple,

11:18.720 --> 11:20.245
get her a prototype of the new iPhone.

11:20.320 --> 11:21.416
How about a private concert?

11:21.440 --> 11:22.960
- You know what band she is into?
- No.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.411
I have a radical suggestion.

11:24.480 --> 11:26.240
Have you tried asking Rebecca
what she wants?

11:26.280 --> 11:28.248
Yes, she wants a cat.

11:28.320 --> 11:29.536
Well, that's in your price range.

11:29.560 --> 11:30.686
I hate cats.

11:30.760 --> 11:32.816
They puke all over the house.
They shed all over everything.

11:32.840 --> 11:34.649
I got an ex-wife, a wife and two kids,

11:34.720 --> 11:36.096
I don't need another thing to feed.

11:36.120 --> 11:37.565
What about a pony?

11:45.720 --> 11:47.643
Could you smile? It's a party.

11:47.720 --> 11:48.881
Why do we always come here?

11:48.960 --> 11:50.769
They're family. More or less.

11:51.240 --> 11:53.846
What are you barking at?
There are no squirrels in the elevator.

11:55.640 --> 11:57.165
Here, take him.

11:59.960 --> 12:01.530
Just pretend you're having fun.

12:01.640 --> 12:03.563
Seriously?

12:08.080 --> 12:09.923
Happy birthday!

12:11.480 --> 12:13.323
I love this yearly ritual

12:13.400 --> 12:15.129
where Tom forgets Rebecca's birthdays

12:15.200 --> 12:17.601
and you forget that Tom
forgets Rebecca's birthdays.

12:17.680 --> 12:18.727
He kind of remembered.

12:18.840 --> 12:21.081
- You'd have to fire a warning shot.
- Madison!

12:21.160 --> 12:23.367
When Tom and I divorced,
he got the younger model.

12:23.440 --> 12:24.566
I'm blushing.

12:24.680 --> 12:26.250
If he loses you, it's jailbait.

12:26.320 --> 12:27.606
Well, that's romantic.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.081
I want you to call my lawyer.

12:30.160 --> 12:31.730
Do you get a finder's fee?

12:31.800 --> 12:33.848
Lara, the day Tom and I divorced

12:33.920 --> 12:35.490
was the happiest day of my life.

12:35.560 --> 12:37.608
I want that happiness for you.

12:37.680 --> 12:39.887
Come on, help me out before
your hands get all shaky.

12:40.840 --> 12:43.969
This is for the road.
I don't want Tom catching us together.

12:44.040 --> 12:46.281
What's he gonna do? Divorce you again?

12:47.840 --> 12:49.365
He would if he could.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.367
Are there gonna be
any boys at the party?

12:52.440 --> 12:54.010
No.</font>

12:54.120 --> 12:55.645
You're turning 11, Rebecca.

12:55.720 --> 12:58.451
Now's the time.
I could help you, you know.

12:58.520 --> 13:00.329
Like how my mom helps your mom.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.209
- What?
- Never mind.

13:02.280 --> 13:03.361
I love your room.

13:03.440 --> 13:04.601
Thank you.

13:04.720 --> 13:06.449
My dad actually likes
spending time with me,

13:06.520 --> 13:08.522
so he never has to buy me off.

13:09.880 --> 13:12.565
Come on. Smile for Instagram.

13:16.240 --> 13:17.765
What if you got her a plush cat?

13:17.840 --> 13:19.251
See, technically, it's a cat.

13:19.360 --> 13:20.725
No, technically, it's not a cat.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.485
Chicago just announced.

13:22.800 --> 13:24.802
Hang on. I got it, I got it, I got it.

13:24.880 --> 13:27.281
Take a look at Tashirojima,

13:27.360 --> 13:29.488
also known as Cat Island.

13:29.560 --> 13:30.800
Put her up there with a nanny.

13:30.880 --> 13:32.609
Best part, you don't
even have to be there.

13:32.680 --> 13:33.680
That's interesting.

13:33.720 --> 13:35.016
She asks for a cat every single year.

13:35.040 --> 13:36.216
You can't just buy your way out.

13:36.240 --> 13:38.004
Mr. Brand, I think the fact that

13:38.080 --> 13:39.736
you've had us put so much time
and thought into this

13:39.760 --> 13:41.120
is really gonna show her you care.

13:41.160 --> 13:42.496
If you wanna show her you really care,

13:42.520 --> 13:43.920
just get her what she really wants.

13:44.080 --> 13:45.969
A cat.</font>

13:47.040 --> 13:48.724
Jeez.

14:05.160 --> 14:08.482
Nearest pet shop, 1.7 miles.

14:15.320 --> 14:16.321
Damn it.

14:16.400 --> 14:17.561
Recalculating.

14:19.400 --> 14:23.291
In one-tenth of a mile, make a right turn.

14:28.920 --> 14:30.649
Make a left turn.

14:37.120 --> 14:38.485
You have arrived.

14:42.520 --> 14:43.521
Jeez!

15:40.640 --> 15:42.051
Get away from me.

15:43.560 --> 15:44.561
Shut up.

15:45.120 --> 15:47.646
Hello? Hello?

15:50.520 --> 15:52.249
- Oh, hello.
- Hi.

15:55.920 --> 15:57.809
You look familiar. Have we met?

15:57.880 --> 15:59.041
Oh, I doubt it.

15:59.120 --> 16:00.849
I know you from somewhere.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.689
Well, I'm on TV a lot.

16:02.760 --> 16:05.161
Yes! Animal Planet. I love that show.

16:05.240 --> 16:06.446
No, not Animal Planet.

16:06.560 --> 16:09.530
- I'm Tom Brand. I own FireBrand.
- There you go.

16:09.600 --> 16:12.001
I use newspaper in the poopy boxes,

16:12.080 --> 16:14.481
and I see your face all the time.

16:15.440 --> 16:16.736
Look, I'm a little late for something,

16:16.760 --> 16:18.524
so if we could just get on with it?</font>

16:18.720 --> 16:20.722
- Meow!
- Sure.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.484
You don't like cats, do you, Mr. Brand?

16:22.560 --> 16:24.376
Look, can I just pick one out?
And then I'll be on my way.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.402
You don't pick a cat. The cat picks you.

16:26.480 --> 16:28.216
Look, I make million-dollar
decisions for lunch.

16:28.240 --> 16:29.616
I'm pretty sure I can pick out a cat.

16:29.640 --> 16:31.483
<font color="#D900D9">See that? He likes you.

16:31.560 --> 16:34.882
It figures because he's
attracted to troubled souls.

16:36.920 --> 16:38.604
Used up seven lives already.

16:39.920 --> 16:42.048
Meow, meow, meow,
meow, meow, meow, meow, meow

16:42.120 --> 16:44.691
Meow, meow, meow, meow Meow, meow, meow

16:45.040 --> 16:48.249
That'll give Chicago the tallest
building in North America

16:48.680 --> 16:50.656
which leaves New York
and FireBrand in second place.

16:50.680 --> 16:52.364
You should pick a bowl.

16:52.440 --> 16:53.696
The company could not
be reached for comment.

16:53.720 --> 16:55.656
But with the opening ceremony
just a month away...

16:55.680 --> 16:57.409
"Mister Fuzzypants."

16:57.480 --> 17:00.131
Yeah. Yeah. Good.

17:00.440 --> 17:01.680
Good choice.

17:02.160 --> 17:03.616
Yeah. Could you just wrap it up for me?

17:03.640 --> 17:04.686
Sure.

17:06.280 --> 17:07.611
<font color="#D900D9">You know, I get it.

17:07.680 --> 17:10.126
"Brand" because your name is Brand.

17:11.800 --> 17:13.882
- But why "Fire"?
- How much do I owe you?

17:13.960 --> 17:16.406
I ask because I did the same thing, see.

17:16.480 --> 17:19.689
My name is Perkins,

17:19.760 --> 17:23.651
so I call my store "Purrkins."

17:23.720 --> 17:26.371
Oh, I see there.

17:26.920 --> 17:29.446
We're just like two peas in a pod.

17:29.720 --> 17:30.926
Yeah. Keep the change.

17:31.240 --> 17:32.526
Oh, wow.

17:36.720 --> 17:39.610
- You might not wanna take that.
- I'm sorry?

17:39.680 --> 17:41.284
You're running late, it's a gift.

17:41.360 --> 17:42.600
You don't want to be late.

17:45.280 --> 17:47.362
For the party?</font>

17:51.840 --> 17:52.841
Right.

17:54.400 --> 17:57.244
Ian, what the hell is going on?

17:59.560 --> 18:01.324
<font color="#D900D9">Okay, cats.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.642
Let's do this.</font>

18:07.880 --> 18:09.325
Oh, good job.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.888
- Happy birthday, baby.
- Thank you.

18:12.960 --> 18:14.560
Okay, first piece for the birthday girl.

18:14.600 --> 18:15.965
And save some for Daddy.

18:16.040 --> 18:18.407
Just put it in the freezer
next to last year's slice.

18:18.520 --> 18:20.363
- Mmm.
- What?

18:26.280 --> 18:27.611
Wait here.

18:51.200 --> 18:52.725
Shut up.

19:03.560 --> 19:04.686
Went with the cat.

19:04.760 --> 19:05.807
Smart move.

19:05.880 --> 19:07.291
Was that news report a joke?

19:07.360 --> 19:09.044
Tom, we can turn this around.

19:09.120 --> 19:10.201
Just look up there.

19:10.280 --> 19:11.691
That antenna's 47 feet.

19:11.760 --> 19:12.886
I spoke to our engineers,

19:12.960 --> 19:15.281
and if we install support lines,
we can raise it up.

19:15.360 --> 19:16.496
That's what they did at One World Trade.

19:16.520 --> 19:18.249
Stop. You dragged me across town

19:18.400 --> 19:20.129
and up 1,900 feet to tell me this?

19:20.200 --> 19:21.201
This is a solution.

19:21.280 --> 19:22.770
- That antenna is...
- Antenna?

19:22.840 --> 19:25.366
I wanted the tallest building,
Ian, not the best reception.

19:25.440 --> 19:26.851
Well, maybe we can add more floors.

19:26.920 --> 19:28.376
Do you know how much planning
went into this?

19:28.400 --> 19:30.016
To get permission to build it this height?

19:30.040 --> 19:31.565
You blew it. We're now standing

19:31.640 --> 19:33.176
on the second tallest
building in North America.

19:33.200 --> 19:35.089
Number two, because you were busy

19:35.160 --> 19:37.208
trying to sell my company behind my back.

19:37.320 --> 19:38.651
- Tom...
- Pack up your office!

19:40.040 --> 19:41.610
I'm late. I know. Stop calling.</font>

19:57.640 --> 19:59.210
- Pull me up.
- You're firing me?

19:59.280 --> 20:00.281
Take my hand!

20:19.280 --> 20:20.645
That hurt.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.240
BP holding steady.

20:24.320 --> 20:25.651
Okay, let's do this on three.

20:25.720 --> 20:26.721
Ready?

20:26.800 --> 20:28.802
One, two, three.

20:32.720 --> 20:34.449
What about that guy?

20:36.640 --> 20:38.563
Huh, this little guy looks fine.

20:41.200 --> 20:43.931
Wow, that guy looks
worse off than me.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.651
And he's wearing my clothes.

20:48.160 --> 20:50.288
And that's my belt.

20:55.360 --> 20:56.725
Seriously?

21:00.760 --> 21:02.683
It's just a bad dream!

21:07.400 --> 21:08.656
The good news is
your husband made it

21:08.680 --> 21:10.409
through surgery with no complications,

21:10.480 --> 21:12.847
but he had severe head trauma
and is unresponsive.

21:12.920 --> 21:14.524
You call this unresponsive?

21:15.120 --> 21:16.246
When will he wake up?

21:16.320 --> 21:17.776
Mrs. Brand, your husband's in a coma.

21:17.800 --> 21:20.963
Once the swelling in the brain is
reduced over the next couple of days,

21:21.040 --> 21:23.008
that's when we're more likely
to see a recovery.

21:23.080 --> 21:24.491
But right now, he's not in there.

21:24.560 --> 21:25.846
That's because I'm in here!

21:25.920 --> 21:27.763
Lara, listen to me! It's me!

21:30.960 --> 21:32.405
Thank God. You can hear me.

21:34.040 --> 21:35.849
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.001
No, no, no, no.

21:37.080 --> 21:38.809
Don't leave me back there.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.928
Hey, leave me with me.

21:45.080 --> 21:46.127
Hi.

21:47.720 --> 21:48.960
Hi, baby.

21:49.720 --> 21:50.926
Can I see Daddy?

21:51.000 --> 21:54.243
Well, he is sleeping right now
so he can't talk to us,

21:54.320 --> 21:56.084
but maybe he can hear us.

21:56.160 --> 21:57.650
We'll go in together, okay?

21:57.720 --> 21:59.210
- Come on.
- Shall we see?

22:00.000 --> 22:02.048
Oh, this is so humiliating.

22:02.120 --> 22:03.485
Hey, Lara. I tried to lift him up,

22:03.560 --> 22:04.686
but I wasn't strong enough.

22:04.800 --> 22:06.165
- Judas.
- No, it's not your fault.

22:06.240 --> 22:07.480
Whose cat is that?

22:07.560 --> 22:08.846
I think he's yours.

22:08.920 --> 22:10.490
I think your dad got him. Let's go see.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.002
Daddy got me a cat?

22:13.080 --> 22:14.764
Amazing, isn't it?

22:24.600 --> 22:25.647
I said I'd call.

22:34.600 --> 22:36.364
Hello, someone, anyone.

22:36.440 --> 22:38.841
I'm trapped inside a cat's body.

22:38.960 --> 22:40.200
Somebody help me!

22:40.280 --> 22:42.760
You, in the horrible green jacket.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.004
So, how are you doin' in there?

22:49.080 --> 22:51.048
The nightmare continues.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.361
Mr. Brand, this is no dream.

22:53.440 --> 22:54.851
- You can hear me?
- Shh.

22:54.920 --> 22:56.763
I'm a cat whisperer.

22:56.840 --> 22:58.888
And I'm the only one who can hear you.

22:58.960 --> 23:00.121
What did you do to me?

23:00.200 --> 23:02.202
I didn't do anything. You fell off a roof.

23:02.280 --> 23:03.930
Fine. How do I get out of this?

23:04.000 --> 23:05.445
Wrong question.

23:05.520 --> 23:08.000
You should ask, "How did I get into this?"

23:08.080 --> 23:09.684
Fine! How did I get into this?

23:09.760 --> 23:11.330
Keep asking that question.

23:11.400 --> 23:12.890
I hope you figure it out.

23:12.960 --> 23:14.564
What does that mean?

23:15.080 --> 23:16.286
Your body won't last long.

23:16.360 --> 23:19.125
If it expires, you're gonna
be stuck in there

23:19.200 --> 23:20.531
for the rest of your life.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.136
You get me out of here, you son of a...

23:22.160 --> 23:23.491
Calm down, Mr. Brand.

23:23.560 --> 23:25.085
You're a cat.

23:25.480 --> 23:26.891
It's not the end of the world.

23:26.960 --> 23:28.769
I hate cats.

23:28.840 --> 23:30.968
That's what makes this so perfect.

23:32.680 --> 23:34.125
All right.

23:34.200 --> 23:35.929
Calm down.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.651
I thought Daddy would get me a kitten.

23:38.720 --> 23:40.165
He is scruffy, isn't he?

23:40.840 --> 23:42.365
What, you want to trade him in.

23:42.480 --> 23:43.481
No!

23:43.560 --> 23:45.085
I didn't think so.

23:45.160 --> 23:47.242
All right, welcome home, cat.

23:47.360 --> 23:48.361
Oh.

23:49.400 --> 23:51.004
Maybe we should let him get comfortable.

23:51.080 --> 23:53.845
He wants to explore.</font>

23:54.000 --> 23:56.446
Can I sleep with you tonight, Mommy?

23:57.200 --> 23:58.565
Yeah, kiddo.

23:59.520 --> 24:01.284
I could use the company.

24:01.360 --> 24:04.045
Message. Let them know I'm me.

24:04.120 --> 24:05.167
Write a message.

24:05.240 --> 24:06.605
Simple.

24:06.680 --> 24:08.728
"Oh, hi, it's Tom.

24:08.840 --> 24:10.126
"Get me out of here."

24:10.200 --> 24:13.966
Just need a few words.

24:14.040 --> 24:15.530
Nothing complicated.

24:53.080 --> 24:55.526
Dear Lara, don't panic. It's Tom.

24:55.600 --> 24:57.967
I seem to be trapped in the body of a cat.

24:58.040 --> 24:59.201
This is not a joke.

24:59.280 --> 25:01.362
Your loving husband, Tom.

25:04.480 --> 25:06.005
Okay, that didn't work.

25:06.080 --> 25:08.401
Although, not bad for a cat.

25:21.280 --> 25:24.443
Ironically, I could really
use a mouse right now.

25:30.920 --> 25:34.481
Mommy, when is Daddy gonna come home?

25:34.560 --> 25:36.005
Just as soon as he wakes up.

25:36.120 --> 25:38.441
They should use a really big alarm clock.

25:38.520 --> 25:40.443
You'd be a great doctor.</font>

25:56.920 --> 25:57.921
What do you want, kitty?

25:58.000 --> 26:01.561
Money clip, plus license equals...

26:01.640 --> 26:02.880
I'm stuck in a cat!

26:02.960 --> 26:04.325
He wants to play.

26:06.640 --> 26:09.371
Well, sorry, kitty. It is bedtime in here.

26:09.440 --> 26:11.124
But we can play tomorrow.

26:11.200 --> 26:12.281
Tomorrow?

26:16.000 --> 26:17.081
Okay.

26:22.760 --> 26:24.285
Where were we?

28:18.960 --> 28:22.248
If I'm in a cat's body,

28:22.320 --> 28:24.641
is a cat in my body?

28:26.160 --> 28:27.730
Oh...

28:27.800 --> 28:29.962
I always hated that rug.

28:31.200 --> 28:32.201
Whoa!

28:34.040 --> 28:35.804
This is good scotch.

29:01.400 --> 29:02.401
Rough night?

29:02.480 --> 29:04.369
No. I was just contemplating

29:04.440 --> 29:07.125
the rest of my life as a cat.

29:08.120 --> 29:09.121
Hmm.

29:15.560 --> 29:17.289
Okay.</font>

29:17.400 --> 29:19.050
Jesus!

29:19.240 --> 29:20.844
Who's hungry?

29:27.000 --> 29:28.001
Oh...

29:30.520 --> 29:31.521
Yum yum.

29:37.680 --> 29:39.762
Looks like a cat already ate this.

29:39.880 --> 29:41.564
Bon appétit.

29:41.640 --> 29:43.608
French. That'll sell this stuff.

29:51.880 --> 29:53.211
All right.

29:56.440 --> 29:57.646
There's your litter box.

29:57.720 --> 29:59.563
No, thank you, I have the rug.

30:11.600 --> 30:13.648
I had a really good excuse.

30:15.600 --> 30:17.602
Here come the floodgates.

30:21.400 --> 30:23.971
You probably think I'm crazy
crying over a piece of cake.

30:24.040 --> 30:26.520
Or that your husband's
in the hospital in a coma.

30:26.600 --> 30:28.364
He's gonna wake up.

30:29.280 --> 30:30.327
Right?

30:30.960 --> 30:33.281
Oh, I really gotta find that Perkins guy.

30:36.920 --> 30:38.490
Hangover!

30:40.600 --> 30:42.125
Hello, kitty.

30:42.440 --> 30:43.805
What should we call you?

30:45.320 --> 30:47.891
Is that your name? Mister Fuzzypants?

30:47.960 --> 30:49.291
I hate karma.

30:49.400 --> 30:51.926
<font color="#D900D9">You're the best gift I ever got.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.445
No, too sweet.</font>

30:55.560 --> 30:57.289
That wasn't funny.

30:59.120 --> 31:00.645
What are you two laughing at?

31:00.720 --> 31:02.882
I don't think it's funny.</font>

31:02.960 --> 31:04.166
See, this is my point of view.

31:04.240 --> 31:07.050
We don't need high rises,
we need strategic growth.

31:07.120 --> 31:08.416
And that's what we've all been saying.

31:08.440 --> 31:10.681
We shouldn't even be
talking about this now.

31:10.760 --> 31:12.000
This isn't a crisis.

31:12.080 --> 31:13.764
This is an opportunity.

31:31.120 --> 31:32.167
What?

31:36.000 --> 31:37.126
What do you need?

31:50.320 --> 31:52.288
If you want food, it's in the bowl.

31:56.880 --> 31:58.041
Fruity Pebbles

31:59.040 --> 32:01.691
or that?

32:05.040 --> 32:06.121
Fruity Pebbles.

32:13.200 --> 32:16.807
Be the cat, be the cat, be the cat,
be the cat, be the cat!

32:19.400 --> 32:20.401
Graceful.

32:21.520 --> 32:22.851
Yeah? You try it.

32:37.280 --> 32:40.329
And, nailed it!

32:41.120 --> 32:42.167
I called your mom, too.

32:42.240 --> 32:43.844
I just wanted to get everyone together.

32:43.920 --> 32:45.126
Well, it smells great.

32:45.200 --> 32:46.850
What are you cooking?

32:48.480 --> 32:50.323
Roast cat.</font>

32:50.680 --> 32:52.728
Maybe its head
got screwed up in the fall.

32:52.800 --> 32:54.376
He's an alcoholic. I can't get him to eat,

32:54.400 --> 32:55.640
but I found an empty decanter,

32:55.720 --> 32:57.609
of 50-year-old Macallan
with fur all over it.

32:57.680 --> 32:59.330
Well, at least he has good taste.

32:59.400 --> 33:01.641
Maybe I should mix scotch into his food.

33:01.720 --> 33:02.896
Can I use Dad's office for a bit?

33:02.920 --> 33:03.967
Yeah, what's up?

33:04.040 --> 33:05.736
I just want to see
if I can find anything else

33:05.760 --> 33:07.649
that might help me
with this whole Chicago...

33:09.480 --> 33:11.528
Do they make MRis for cats?

33:11.880 --> 33:13.405
You mean CAT scans?

33:14.560 --> 33:16.403
I should have landed on the knives.

33:18.200 --> 33:19.611
I'll be in the office.

33:26.400 --> 33:27.731
Hi.

33:35.040 --> 33:36.087
So,

33:36.200 --> 33:37.531
are you like Dad now?

33:37.960 --> 33:39.007
What do you mean?

33:39.120 --> 33:40.531
Are you president of the company?

33:41.160 --> 33:44.050
No, I'm doing the same job,
just without Dad.

33:44.680 --> 33:46.045
Can you come out soon?

33:46.120 --> 33:47.610
Yeah, in a minute.

33:47.760 --> 33:49.922
You're so totally like Dad.

33:54.040 --> 33:55.326
Lara!

33:55.400 --> 33:57.767
Oh, good! Satan's over for dinner.

33:58.360 --> 34:01.364
So sorry about Tom.
I always thought it would be skydiving,

34:01.440 --> 34:02.920
or that his secretary would just snap

34:02.960 --> 34:04.450
and bring an Uzi to the office.

34:04.600 --> 34:06.807
I thought you'd die from a Botox overdose.

34:07.080 --> 34:08.730
Oh, you brought the dogs.</font>

34:09.840 --> 34:11.284
Princess, Jeanette!

34:21.960 --> 34:24.850
You know Tom's unconscious, right?
You can take the night off.

34:24.920 --> 34:26.842
Yeah, well, someone
has to keep things going.

34:26.960 --> 34:29.440
I never understood why you wanted
to work for him anyway.

34:29.520 --> 34:31.362
- Mom, if we could not talk...
- Hey.

34:31.440 --> 34:33.487
This isn't healthy.

34:51.120 --> 34:52.770
Chicken soup for grief.</font>

34:55.560 --> 34:57.005
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

35:05.440 --> 35:06.851
Stop it. Get out of here.

35:08.680 --> 35:09.681
Heel!

35:11.040 --> 35:13.256
Can you please take them away?
They're really scaring him.

35:13.280 --> 35:15.806
They have a very strong sense
about other animals.

35:15.880 --> 35:17.882
- Where'd your dad get him?
- Why?

35:17.960 --> 35:20.008
Well, did he just
pick him up off the streets?

35:20.080 --> 35:21.764
He's just a little messy.

35:21.880 --> 35:24.008
I know you're upset
because your dad's dying...

35:24.280 --> 35:26.886
He's not dying. He's just unconscious.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.890
My mom says your mom should be
more realistic about his condition.

35:31.640 --> 35:33.404
Princess, Jeanette, heel!

35:35.320 --> 35:36.845
T

35:37.320 --> 35:39.163
O

35:39.560 --> 35:40.721
M.

35:44.200 --> 35:45.884
Madison, David, Rebecca, Nicole.

35:47.120 --> 35:48.121
What?

35:48.400 --> 35:49.686
I set a place for Tom.

35:50.040 --> 35:53.249
Well, that's a weird habit.
It's not like he's usually here for dinner.

35:53.600 --> 35:55.045
Madison, not tonight.

35:55.240 --> 35:57.481
I'd say the same thing if he were here.

35:57.560 --> 35:59.005
Yes, that's why nobody likes you.

35:59.080 --> 36:01.162
But there's a reason
you've been seeing Josh.

36:01.240 --> 36:02.287
Josh?

36:02.360 --> 36:04.056
Oh, I can't even think
about that right now.

36:04.080 --> 36:07.163
Now's the perfect time.
It's not like Tom could catch you.

36:09.960 --> 36:11.405
Who needs a litter box?

36:22.440 --> 36:25.683
Oh, Madison? I've been a bad kitty.

36:27.280 --> 36:28.930
Hey! You...

36:33.000 --> 36:34.126
Oh...

36:34.560 --> 36:35.971
Cheese!</font>

36:48.280 --> 36:49.884
Sorry, everybody.

36:50.800 --> 36:51.847
- Wait.
- What?

36:52.320 --> 36:54.800
Nothing, I just thought
I saw... Nothing. It's okay.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.082
Lara, that cat needs to be put down.

36:57.160 --> 36:58.161
Hey!

36:58.320 --> 36:59.600
I'll buy you a new bag, Madison.

36:59.640 --> 37:02.769
Hire a trainer,
a cat whisperer, I don't care.

37:03.400 --> 37:05.164
Let's get you a new martini.

37:05.520 --> 37:06.601
Yes.

37:06.800 --> 37:09.883
Well, someone's gotta talk
about the empty chair.

37:10.640 --> 37:13.041
- Should we do toasts?
- It's not a wake, Mom.

37:13.360 --> 37:15.328
This isn't Tom's
first time in the hospital.

37:15.640 --> 37:17.483
Remember when he launched the airline?

37:17.560 --> 37:19.608
He was always on the phone, never slept.

37:19.680 --> 37:20.920
You know what you asked me?

37:21.000 --> 37:22.047
Vampire.

37:22.120 --> 37:23.770
Why is Daddy a vampire?

37:24.000 --> 37:26.367
Because Mommy sucked all his blood.

37:26.440 --> 37:28.169
He'd stay awake all night working out,

37:28.240 --> 37:30.925
and then one day, he just fell
asleep on a moving treadmill.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.729
He was in the hospital for a week.

37:33.120 --> 37:34.804
Best vacation I ever had.

37:34.880 --> 37:36.896
I'd wake up and find him
on the balcony at 4:00 a.m.

37:36.920 --> 37:38.763
just staring at his tower.

37:38.840 --> 37:39.887
I'll say this for Tom.

37:39.960 --> 37:41.160
There was never another woman.

37:41.200 --> 37:42.361
With me, it was an airline.

37:42.440 --> 37:44.442
With you, it's a big skyscraper.

37:44.520 --> 37:45.931
Ignore everything you hear tonight.

37:46.120 --> 37:47.963
I'm not a role model, Rebecca.

37:48.040 --> 37:49.371
You're used to it.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.204
- How about that toast?
- Mmm-hmm.

37:51.440 --> 37:53.681
- To Dad. Wake up soon.
- We miss you.

37:53.840 --> 37:55.365
Or your tower misses you.

38:09.880 --> 38:11.245
Sleep well?

38:12.360 --> 38:15.762
Rebecca Alison Brand,
your cat destroyed the yellow pages!

38:15.880 --> 38:17.530
What's a yellow pages?

38:44.480 --> 38:45.845
That cat you got,

38:45.920 --> 38:46.920
he's lucky you're in here

38:46.960 --> 38:48.610
or you'd have killed him by now.

38:48.720 --> 38:50.006
I got a plan to beat Chicago.

38:50.080 --> 38:51.923
I just need to sell it to the Board.

38:52.240 --> 38:54.641
When you wake up, we might be number one.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.256
We're doing
the best that we can do.

38:57.280 --> 38:58.884
Okay. Thank you so much.

39:04.680 --> 39:05.920
What are you doing here?

39:06.000 --> 39:08.336
Sprained my wrist. That's why
I couldn't hold on to your Dad.

39:08.360 --> 39:10.336
You're seeing my Dad's neurologist
about your wrist?

39:10.360 --> 39:11.576
The Board needs updates on his status.

39:11.600 --> 39:12.761
So ask me.

39:12.840 --> 39:15.216
We're not going to take medical
advice from the grieving son.

39:15.240 --> 39:16.536
It's a massive transition for the company.

39:16.560 --> 39:17.686
What transition?

39:17.760 --> 39:20.206
Big day at the office.
Good luck with the Board.

39:22.600 --> 39:23.886
We're losing by that much.

39:23.960 --> 39:25.405
We get 70 feet, we're number one.

39:25.480 --> 39:27.562
Now, our structure
can't support another floor,

39:27.640 --> 39:31.008
and unfortunately we can't just
smuggle a wrecking ball into Chicago,

39:31.080 --> 39:32.650
so we need to shed weight.

39:32.720 --> 39:34.120
I thought we were making it taller.

39:34.440 --> 39:35.965
We lose one floor,

39:36.360 --> 39:37.566
it buys us this.

39:37.640 --> 39:38.880
That's gonna collapse.

39:38.960 --> 39:40.086
Not if we use titanium.

39:40.160 --> 39:41.456
Why don't we just build it out of gold?

39:41.480 --> 39:43.323
It's as strong as steel
and half the weight.

39:43.440 --> 39:45.761
I don't know what problem
you're trying to solve here.

39:45.840 --> 39:46.841
Excuse me?

39:46.960 --> 39:49.247
This is a stack of prime real
estate in Manhattan.

39:49.320 --> 39:50.776
We can't charge rent on a jungle gym.

39:50.800 --> 39:52.536
My father didn't build
the tallest skyscraper

39:52.560 --> 39:54.688
in the Northern Hemisphere
for a little rent money.

39:54.760 --> 39:56.171
It's not the tallest skyscraper.

39:56.320 --> 39:57.731
Because you screwed up.

39:57.800 --> 39:58.801
Hmm.

40:01.280 --> 40:05.171
Look. If Tom were here, you know
this is exactly what he would do.

40:05.240 --> 40:08.244
I appreciate that you want
to honor your father, David.

40:08.320 --> 40:09.481
We need to watch the books.

40:09.560 --> 40:12.848
Our company can't keep diverting
funds into Tom's pet projects.

40:13.280 --> 40:14.486
It's his company.

40:14.560 --> 40:15.607
Thank you, David.

40:16.160 --> 40:17.685
He's not dead.

40:30.280 --> 40:32.123
- Meow.
- Meow.

40:32.400 --> 40:33.447
You wanna try?

40:33.520 --> 40:34.521
You wanna try?

40:34.600 --> 40:35.840
Lord help me.

40:36.600 --> 40:40.127
Okay, let's try "A purse
is not a litter box."

40:40.680 --> 40:42.603
A purse is not a litter box.

40:45.920 --> 40:48.287
Mr. Fuzzypants was the last thing
her father gave her,

40:48.360 --> 40:49.850
so she's really latched on.

40:50.040 --> 40:52.725
Mmm. He wants attention, obviously.

40:53.040 --> 40:54.883
- This is our daughter, Rebecca.
- Hello.

40:55.320 --> 40:57.049
You are going to tell
them every word I say.

41:00.160 --> 41:01.366
Good move. Nice.

41:01.640 --> 41:02.801
You try it.

41:02.880 --> 41:05.690
Your dad bought this cat at my store.
Did you know that?

41:05.920 --> 41:07.490
Who cares? Just translate.

41:07.560 --> 41:10.723
I remember, he said he wanted you
to have exactly what you asked for.

41:10.840 --> 41:13.684
Hey, cat freak, I didn't call you
down here to ignore me.

41:14.520 --> 41:16.761
Could we have
a moment of privacy, please?

41:18.640 --> 41:19.801
You and the cat?

41:19.880 --> 41:20.881
- Yeah.
- Okay.

41:27.640 --> 41:29.881
You don't have
time for games, Mr. Brand.

41:29.960 --> 41:31.450
Tell them who I am.

41:31.520 --> 41:33.090
I'm not your press agent.

41:35.880 --> 41:37.040
Well, you're a cat whisperer,

41:37.080 --> 41:39.082
and I'm pretty sure I'm still a cat!

41:41.920 --> 41:43.001
Have you asked yourself

41:43.080 --> 41:44.650
how you got into this position?

41:44.720 --> 41:45.936
I tried googling it, but you know,

41:45.960 --> 41:48.008
they don't make keyboards for paws!

41:48.080 --> 41:51.129
You're acting like a beast
and you're driving your family crazy.

41:51.200 --> 41:53.885
These doctors can't
keep you alive forever,

41:53.960 --> 41:57.601
so if you want to get out of this,
you have to behave.

41:58.200 --> 42:00.931
And if your human body goes,
get used to those paws.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.604
You'll be a cat forever.

42:06.840 --> 42:08.968
I am not eating cat food.

42:09.240 --> 42:10.730
You'll eat cat food or else.

42:10.840 --> 42:12.524
Oh, I'm 10 pounds and covered in fur.

42:12.600 --> 42:14.364
What else could you possibly do to me?

42:14.440 --> 42:16.329
This cat has not been fixed.

42:16.720 --> 42:17.767
Don't you dare.

42:18.240 --> 42:20.368
Oh, should I take him to the vet?

42:20.440 --> 42:21.680
- Perkins...
- Let's wait.

42:21.760 --> 42:23.416
- If you so much as lay a finger on...
- He's made progress.

42:23.440 --> 42:25.169
He's gonna be better now.

42:25.240 --> 42:28.130
If he's not eating his food,
using his poopy box,

42:28.520 --> 42:30.807
give me a call. I'll clip him myself.

42:30.960 --> 42:32.121
You hear that, Fuzzypants?

42:32.200 --> 42:34.441
I am the sixth richest
person in Manhattan!

42:34.520 --> 42:35.567
A well-behaved pet

42:35.640 --> 42:37.642
brings love and comfort to a home.

42:38.320 --> 42:41.005
And your family needs that right now,

42:41.120 --> 42:42.201
so are you gonna behave?

42:42.840 --> 42:44.569
You need to be a cat.

42:45.640 --> 42:47.563
Okay, I'll be a cat.

42:47.640 --> 42:48.641
Behave.

42:50.640 --> 42:51.721
No clipping.

42:53.480 --> 42:54.811
All the best.

42:57.440 --> 42:58.521
All the best.

42:59.920 --> 43:01.809
Who needs to be fixed?

43:02.160 --> 43:05.881
Yes, letting salmon breathe
all day really brings out the flavor.

43:09.120 --> 43:11.043
Lord, help me.

43:12.360 --> 43:14.089
How do cats eat this stuff?

43:16.400 --> 43:18.767
Ah... I can't.

43:21.680 --> 43:24.251
I'm starving.

43:36.560 --> 43:40.360
Come on. Come on, Fuzzypants,
you can do it. Come on.

43:40.960 --> 43:42.291
Hold it, hold it still.

43:42.360 --> 43:44.966
Hold it still, hold it, hold it still.

43:45.200 --> 43:46.725
Is this supposed to be fun?

43:47.960 --> 43:48.961
Yeah.

43:49.720 --> 43:51.051
Just drown me.

43:56.480 --> 43:58.289
Well, that's an improvement.

43:58.880 --> 44:00.086
Look.

44:00.160 --> 44:01.321
Seriously?

44:21.520 --> 44:22.567
Good kitty.

44:23.600 --> 44:25.090
Public humiliation.

44:26.320 --> 44:27.321
Hi, Josh.

44:27.400 --> 44:28.447
Josh?

44:28.560 --> 44:30.608
I got something I have to show you.

44:30.680 --> 44:32.250
Look, I can't keep doing this.

44:32.320 --> 44:34.640
No, I'm not taking no for an answer.
I'm already on my way.

44:34.760 --> 44:36.444
Yeah, I'm not gonna...

44:37.080 --> 44:38.525
I'll text you the address, okay?

44:44.720 --> 44:46.245
Don't even think about it.

44:46.320 --> 44:47.896
Come on, get out of there.
I gotta get going.

44:47.920 --> 44:48.921
Let's go.

45:01.960 --> 45:03.450
Missing something?</font>

45:05.240 --> 45:07.368
Here, kitty. Here, kitty.
Here, kitty. Here, kitty.

45:07.440 --> 45:08.520
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

45:08.600 --> 45:10.011
Oh!

45:10.360 --> 45:11.361
Sorry, honey.

45:12.120 --> 45:14.088
Kitty, kitty. Come on, kitty, kitty.

45:22.840 --> 45:24.126
Of all the cats in the world,

45:24.240 --> 45:26.402
of course Tom picked you.
You're just like him.

45:26.480 --> 45:28.120
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

45:28.160 --> 45:30.766
Stubborn and selfish and shedding.

45:30.840 --> 45:32.205
But here's the difference.

45:32.280 --> 45:34.601
I'm legally barred
from castrating my husband.

45:35.560 --> 45:36.721
Drop 'em.

45:38.960 --> 45:40.007
Good kitty.

46:17.200 --> 46:18.611
Nailed it!

46:35.320 --> 46:36.765
Excuse me, who are you?

46:38.440 --> 46:39.726
Who are you?

46:40.120 --> 46:41.451
None of your business.

46:45.040 --> 46:46.565
We've only got one day in Ohio, so...

46:46.640 --> 46:48.722
- You're selling the company.
- I'll call you back.

46:48.800 --> 46:50.576
You're cutting the books,
you're lining up a roadshow,

46:50.600 --> 46:52.736
and you got Goldman Sachs camped out
in the conference room.

46:52.760 --> 46:53.960
We're taking FireBrand public.

46:54.160 --> 46:56.296
- With the CEO in a coma?
- The odds that he recovers...

46:56.320 --> 46:57.731
- When he wakes up...
- If.

46:57.840 --> 47:01.128
He is gonna fire every single one of you.

47:01.280 --> 47:02.486
Calculated risk.

47:02.560 --> 47:05.131
David, when this deal goes through,
your family makes billions.

47:05.200 --> 47:07.965
Just take the money.
You don't owe Tom Brand a thing.

47:23.760 --> 47:25.125
Hi, Josh.

47:25.840 --> 47:26.841
This is pretty.

47:27.120 --> 47:28.406
It's gorgeous, right?

47:28.480 --> 47:30.403
He's an Abercrombie model?

47:30.480 --> 47:31.720
Wait till you see this view.

47:37.760 --> 47:38.966
- Hi, Josh.
- Hi.

47:39.840 --> 47:41.001
We need to talk.

47:41.080 --> 47:42.127
Let's talk inside.

47:42.200 --> 47:44.282
No, let's just do it out here.

47:44.400 --> 47:45.925
Where, in the grass?

47:46.000 --> 47:47.889
I know that we've been at this for months,

47:47.960 --> 47:50.440
and you must be anxious
for some kind of decision.

47:50.960 --> 47:52.371
I can't keep seeing you.

47:52.480 --> 47:54.482
Lara, just take a look at...

47:58.000 --> 47:59.126
Mr. Fuzzypants?

47:59.280 --> 48:00.281
Seriously?

48:00.800 --> 48:02.802
What are you doing here?

48:03.080 --> 48:05.890
You know, getting out of the city
is really great for a pet.

48:05.960 --> 48:07.456
And this place just went
on the market today.

48:07.480 --> 48:09.528
- Market?
- I can't look at any more houses.

48:09.600 --> 48:10.601
What?

48:13.640 --> 48:14.720
When Madison introduced us,

48:14.760 --> 48:16.091
she said you were ready to buy.

48:16.160 --> 48:17.161
I thought I was.

48:17.240 --> 48:20.483
New house, new job,
I was ready to leave Tom.

48:20.800 --> 48:22.290
She was leaving me.

48:22.640 --> 48:24.642
So, what's changed?

48:24.720 --> 48:27.849
Well, what's changed is
I have this shaggy gremlin,

48:27.920 --> 48:29.604
and even when he's stalking me,

48:29.680 --> 48:33.571
he's a constant reminder, the last thing
Tom did was for his daughter,

48:33.680 --> 48:34.806
and I love him.

48:34.880 --> 48:35.881
And I love you.

48:35.960 --> 48:37.849
- I need to go.
- I never stopped.

48:41.200 --> 48:42.247
Are you happy now?

48:42.320 --> 48:44.049
Not until you are.

48:47.440 --> 48:49.329
- Dr. Cole.
- Uh-oh.

48:49.840 --> 48:51.126
Bad news?

48:57.560 --> 49:01.326
Rebecca, I was just visiting Daddy.

49:01.840 --> 49:03.001
He is still sleeping.

49:03.080 --> 49:05.082
He's getting better, though, right?

49:05.160 --> 49:07.049
His body is getting better,

49:07.120 --> 49:09.202
but he's been sleeping so long,

49:09.280 --> 49:11.806
Dr. Cole doesn't know
if he's gonna wake up.

49:11.880 --> 49:13.370
But he could.

49:14.000 --> 49:15.126
He could.

49:15.200 --> 49:17.362
Mom, then it's gonna be okay.

49:18.080 --> 49:22.244
Dad's been working so hard,
he just needs extra sleep.

49:29.480 --> 49:31.608
Three cool cats

49:32.960 --> 49:35.247
Three cool cats

49:36.800 --> 49:39.929
Parked on the corner in a beat-up car

49:40.440 --> 49:43.569
Dividing up a nickel candy bar

49:44.720 --> 49:47.371
Talking all about how sharp they are

49:47.440 --> 49:49.761
These three cool cats

49:52.600 --> 49:53.840
I'm so sorry, baby.

49:53.920 --> 49:55.081
Not now.

49:55.800 --> 49:58.326
Three cool chicks

49:59.600 --> 50:03.047
Walkin' down the street
Swingin' their hips

50:03.760 --> 50:06.684
Splitting up a bag of potato chips

50:06.760 --> 50:10.606
And three cool cats
did three big flips for

50:10.920 --> 50:13.287
Three cool chicks

50:14.760 --> 50:18.481
Up popped the first cool cat
He said, "Man, look at that!

50:18.640 --> 50:22.087
"Man, do you see what I see?"

50:22.280 --> 50:25.841
- "I want that middle chick!"
- "I want that little chick!"

50:25.960 --> 50:29.009
"Hey, man, save one chick for me!"

50:29.640 --> 50:32.450
Three cool chicks</font>

50:33.600 --> 50:35.443
Three cool chicks

50:37.040 --> 50:40.726
They look like angels from up above

50:40.880 --> 50:44.646
And three cool cats really fell in love

50:44.760 --> 50:48.731
But three cool chicks
made three fools of these

50:48.800 --> 50:50.962
Three cool cats

50:52.560 --> 50:54.403
Three cool cats

50:54.480 --> 50:55.641
What?

50:56.360 --> 50:58.488
Three cool cats

51:03.600 --> 51:05.090
What's wrong?

51:10.240 --> 51:11.480
Oh, boy.

51:13.000 --> 51:14.490
I'm an idiot.

51:21.480 --> 51:23.847
I should have been a better dad.

51:31.040 --> 51:32.087
Hey.

51:32.160 --> 51:33.969
My mom said you needed company right now,

51:34.040 --> 51:36.008
so I'm volunteering my time.

51:36.080 --> 51:37.764
I kind of wanna
be alone right now.

51:39.880 --> 51:41.530
You should go wash your face.

51:41.600 --> 51:44.365
Crying really doesn't work
with your complexion.

51:52.440 --> 51:54.010
She's a wreck.

52:00.880 --> 52:01.881
Hey!

52:10.200 --> 52:11.216
Your stupid cat took my...

52:11.240 --> 52:12.969
Why would you share this?

52:13.040 --> 52:14.963
I wanted to show some boys.

52:15.040 --> 52:16.644
If they see you when you're vulnerable,

52:16.720 --> 52:17.856
they'll wanna take care of you and...

52:17.880 --> 52:19.723
You sent this one to half our class.

52:19.800 --> 52:20.847
That was a joke.

52:20.920 --> 52:22.684
You know what, my dad is in the hospital.

52:22.760 --> 52:24.205
Explain the joke to me.

52:24.280 --> 52:25.964
I was just trying to help.

52:26.080 --> 52:27.411
That's what friends do.

52:27.480 --> 52:29.721
You know what,
my mom is friends with your mom,

52:29.800 --> 52:31.290
and I see you over here a lot,

52:31.360 --> 52:32.600
but stop pretending, Nicole.

52:32.680 --> 52:34.250
We're not friends!

52:41.040 --> 52:43.122
I can't believe you just did that!

52:45.120 --> 52:48.488
Good work, but why did you grab her phone?

52:48.600 --> 52:50.090
Because I'm your daddy.

52:51.080 --> 52:52.081
Ew!

53:01.400 --> 53:04.529
Livanto, round and balanced.

53:04.600 --> 53:06.807
I can't play, Mr. Fuzzypants.

53:11.840 --> 53:14.081
That was the right answer.

53:22.280 --> 53:24.567
If this is what it takes
to become human,

53:27.840 --> 53:30.730
I will be the best cat that ever lived.

54:01.000 --> 54:04.209
Hey, I brought something
that's gonna wake you up.

54:04.800 --> 54:06.768
An invitation to the grand opening

54:06.840 --> 54:09.320
of the tallest lightning rod

54:09.400 --> 54:11.641
in the Northern Hemisphere.

54:13.880 --> 54:16.486
I miss sharing things with you, Tom.

54:17.680 --> 54:19.728
That's why you need to wake up.

54:19.800 --> 54:23.009
I'm not going to this thing
without a date.

54:41.680 --> 54:43.444
Are you figuring this out?

54:43.520 --> 54:45.216
Hey. I just want
another look at Dad's files.

54:45.240 --> 54:46.287
Okay.

54:46.360 --> 54:48.089
Is everything all right?

54:50.280 --> 54:52.408
They locked up investors this morning.

54:52.480 --> 54:54.528
FireBrand's going to the
New York Stock Exchange.

54:54.600 --> 54:55.681
When?

54:55.760 --> 54:59.446
They're announcing it
when they open the tower.

54:59.840 --> 55:01.490
Ian totally went behind our back.</font>

55:01.560 --> 55:03.616
He's lined up Benson and Stein
and the rest of the Board

55:03.640 --> 55:04.641
in a secret deal.

55:06.480 --> 55:08.376
Turns out, Ian's been working
on this plan for months

55:08.400 --> 55:09.845
and was waiting for the right time.

55:11.640 --> 55:12.766
Tom would kill them.

55:12.840 --> 55:14.444
They don't care.

55:19.240 --> 55:22.210
Did he leave any directives or anything?

55:22.480 --> 55:25.131
Uh, there's a will, but he's not dead.

55:25.200 --> 55:27.089
Yeah, I know, I know. I know.

55:27.160 --> 55:28.730
I just hope there's something in here

55:28.800 --> 55:31.531
that'll help me fight this thing.

55:39.160 --> 55:41.640
Damn. I'm everywhere.

56:10.640 --> 56:12.290
David Brand.

56:12.720 --> 56:14.768
You're gonna need a raise.

56:20.120 --> 56:23.203
But first, let's give you a promotion.

56:37.640 --> 56:40.166
David's pulling files from legal.
He's gonna fight this.

56:40.240 --> 56:42.200
As long as we get to market,
he can't do anything.

56:49.280 --> 56:52.841
Articles of incorporation.
Where are they?

56:53.680 --> 56:55.762
I did find this in Tom's desk.

56:55.840 --> 56:58.207
He left all his voting shares to David.

56:58.480 --> 57:00.209
Did the audit find anything like this?

57:00.280 --> 57:01.281
No.

57:01.520 --> 57:03.204
David knows. He has to know.

57:03.280 --> 57:05.248
If he knew, we wouldn't be here.

57:05.320 --> 57:07.004
I never saw Tom hug David.

57:07.080 --> 57:08.241
I'm not much of a hugger.

57:08.360 --> 57:10.601
He's got him working
out of that broom closet.

57:10.680 --> 57:12.569
I keep wanting to call Child Services.

57:12.640 --> 57:14.324
<font color="#D900D9">Yo!

57:14.400 --> 57:16.164
Well then,

57:16.240 --> 57:18.811
I never saw this. Did you?

57:18.880 --> 57:19.881
Never.

57:19.960 --> 57:22.964
We all appreciate the way
you've handled this situation.

57:23.040 --> 57:26.761
If Tom doesn't pull through,
we want you to take the helm.

57:26.880 --> 57:28.166
- Okay, thank you.
- Hmm.

57:31.960 --> 57:33.610
- Hang in there.
- Yeah.

58:57.200 --> 58:58.281
Hey, Mom.

58:58.360 --> 59:00.376
I hand you the keys
to a multi-billion dollar company

59:00.400 --> 59:01.401
and you call your mother?

59:01.480 --> 59:03.369
Do you still have the files
from the divorce?

59:03.560 --> 59:05.130
Oh, yeah.

59:05.200 --> 59:07.885
<font color="#D900D9">Princess, Jeanette, shut it!

59:08.600 --> 59:11.888
All of the company records
for the first 10 years are in here.

59:11.960 --> 59:15.089
Should probably get rid of this stuff,
but it makes me nostalgic.

59:15.160 --> 59:16.241
- For Dad?
- His money.

59:16.320 --> 59:17.651
Well, at least you got half.

59:18.200 --> 59:20.680
I don't know how he did it,
building this company from scratch.

59:20.720 --> 59:23.530
He never came home. That's how he did it.

59:23.600 --> 59:24.726
Why are you doing this?

59:24.800 --> 59:26.529
Are you waiting for
him to say, "Good job"?

59:26.600 --> 59:28.456
'Cause your father is
never gonna give you that.

59:28.480 --> 59:30.721
- What's this?
- Well...

59:30.800 --> 59:31.881
What?

59:31.960 --> 59:33.096
When your father was just starting off,

59:33.120 --> 59:34.816
he couldn't think of
a name for the company,

59:34.840 --> 59:37.241
and then one day,
you drew a picture of him.

59:37.320 --> 59:39.322
He was never there, but he loved you.

59:40.680 --> 59:42.091
It's your company, too.

59:42.160 --> 59:44.162
You named the damn thing.

59:44.800 --> 59:47.246
It's rare for a company
to be so interested in a patient.

59:47.320 --> 59:49.004
Tom wasn't just a boss,
he was a friend.

59:49.080 --> 59:50.136
I want to know how he's doing.

59:50.160 --> 59:52.056
He could wake up tomorrow,
he could stay like this forever.

59:52.080 --> 59:53.206
We really don't know.

59:53.280 --> 59:54.936
- Well, what are the odds?
- It's hard to say.

59:54.960 --> 59:56.485
At this point, less than 1%?

59:56.560 --> 59:58.576
If you've done your research,
I don't know what else you want.

59:58.600 --> 01:00:00.496
I'm concerned that you're
giving his wife false hope.

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:01.806
I told her we don't know.

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:04.451
Well, you know, that makes it sound
like it could go either way.

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:05.536
I can't tell her what to do.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:07.056
I just want you to tell her the truth.

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:09.686
Dragging this out
is so hard on this family.

01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:11.611
Just think about it.

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.801
Lara, you're so beautiful.

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:49.769
Did I tell you often enough?

01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:58.161
<font color="#D900D9">Oh.

01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:01.005
I just wanna say that I'm...

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:02.080
I'm sorry.

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:04.088
Hello, there. Come here.

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:07.131
I'm not in the mood for crazy tonight.

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:09.000
Good boy.

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:16.042
I guess this isn't easy for you,
huh, Mr. Fuzzypants?

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:18.521
Meeting a family like this?

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:20.204
Do you need a cuddle?

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:22.129
Somebody need a cuddle tonight?

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:29.201
Okay.

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:31.647
This is a special treat just for us.

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:33.601
Don't tell.

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:35.967
Sadly, I've got no one to tell.

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:43.088
How does that feel, huh?

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:44.730
Very, very sad.

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:47.965
Good night.

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:52.131
I love you.

01:01:58.480 --> 01:01:59.641
Lara.

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:01.605
Lara, wake up.

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:09.890
Are you trying to be my hairdresser?

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:13.881
Hello?

01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:17.005
Send him right up.

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:23.120
Do you have a company to sell?

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:24.440
No, the tower opening's tonight

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:25.616
and I didn't see your name on the list.

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:26.766
I'm not getting out much.

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:28.481
We'd love to have you.

01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:29.766
I'm sure you would.

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:32.322
Lara, we all miss Tom very much.

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:36.686
And maybe it's not my place
to say this, but you have to know.

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:39.088
- He's not coming back.
- Mom?

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:40.685
Go back to your room, Rebecca.

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:42.125
What is he talking about?

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:44.202
Just get ready for school, okay, sweetie?

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:50.696
You don't know what you're talking about.

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:52.000
The doctors say he has a chance.

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:53.570
I understand. If I were you,

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:55.847
I would do anything to keep him alive.

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:58.323
- But this could go on for months.
- I can wait.

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:00.448
Or years. And he never wakes up.

01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:02.125
And Rebecca, she needs to mourn,

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:03.536
she can't do that if she's waiting

01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:05.016
for a father who's never coming home.

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:06.041
Ian, don't...

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:10.401
- No!
- Oh!

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:13.769
Get this off of me!

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:18.928
Please! Get this beast off of me.

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:24.201
All right, in the cage.

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:25.321
What did I do?

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:26.686
You are going into the cage.

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:29.570
That cat is feral, and you need
to take it to the pound.

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:30.801
This is a brand new suit!

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:35.488
He just clawed you before I could.

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:37.369
- Lara...
- I am not an idiot.

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:39.080
You're not here because you care about me

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:40.485
or about Rebecca or about Tom.

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:43.450
And I am not unplugging my husband
to help your bottom line.

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:45.520
- Bye, Mom.
- Wait, honey, I'll walk you to school.

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:48.643
No, it's okay, Mom. It's only
a couple of blocks and I'm 11.

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:49.886
Okay.

01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:00.769
I understand. You want to protect Rebecca.

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:03.002
And I want to protect the company.

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:04.605
But we both need the same thing.

01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:07.121
Goodbye, Ian.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.411
Where's my dry cleaning?

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:25.016
Mr. Cox, you're scheduled at the tower.

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:26.296
Yeah, I know.
Tell the Board I'm running late.

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:28.448
- Oh, they're in Mr. Brand's office.
- What?

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:30.602
But I moved up your meeting
with the event planner.

01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:34.481
Why aren't you at the tower?

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:36.096
- You called a meeting.
- I didn't call a meeting.

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:37.690
David called the meeting.

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:38.807
Were you gonna tell me?

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:40.644
He said he just needed the Board.

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:50.883
You figured it out.

01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:00.641
Where's the Board?

01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:02.131
I sent them ahead to the tower.

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:03.336
Sorry they missed your meeting.

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:04.536
That's okay. We'll do it there.

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:05.696
We're gonna have a little vote.

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:07.176
Yeah, you know,
you're not going to the opening.

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:09.646
- Really?
- Yeah. Mr. Brand no longer works for us.

01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:11.165
He's right. I own the company.

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:13.129
Not yet. Please escort
him off the property.

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:14.201
Don't touch me.

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:16.806
Ian, you do this, I will come
at you with an army of lawyers.

01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:18.326
Go ahead. Sue me.

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:20.004
Do it tomorrow when we're both rich.

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:22.616
Do you really think you can steal
FireBrand with a couple of bouncers?

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:24.496
And you think you can stop me
with a note from Daddy?

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:26.204
Your father's dying. You lost his company.

01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:28.521
At the end of the day,
you're not Tom Brand.

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:52.646
Look who's back.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.729
I knew you'd be back.

01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:58.489
Look who's here.

01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:09.403
What can I do for you, birthday girl?

01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:11.164
I want you to take the cat back.

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:12.810
What's he done?

01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:16.249
He's been great. It's just...

01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:18.368
I think they might wanna take him away

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:20.647
and maybe he'd be better off back here.

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:23.241
I get returns all the time.

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:26.046
Some cats just don't take
to their new family.

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:29.250
When I met your father,
I hoped it would work out.

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:31.922
I know it's stupid, but sometimes I feel

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.241
like my dad's looking out
for me through the cat.

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:35.526
You miss him.

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:38.764
I do. I love my dad so much.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.001
And he loves you,

01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:42.970
but it's not enough
to say you love someone.

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:44.929
You have to show it. Sometimes,

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:47.605
love means sacrifice.

01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:49.806
You have to show it.

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:55.649
When you came to the house,
you were talking to him.

01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:58.287
It's what I do. I'm a cat whisperer.

01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:02.448
Yeah, but you were talking
to him like he was a person.

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:06.045
Is this cat my dad?

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:08.403
Perkins, listen.
You have to tell her.

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:10.330
- What do you think?
- Well,

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:14.610
he makes me feel like my dad's still
around more than he ever was before.

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:16.121
Sometimes,

01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:19.161
I almost wish my daddy
was more like the cat.

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:23.090
But I really just want my daddy back.</font>

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:25.640
Excuse me a minute.

01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:29.722
I'm gonna show you something.

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:44.484
I'll be right back.

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:46.601
Wait.

01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:54.127
You should stay with us.

01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:56.009
A cat's life is so much better.

01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:57.684
Thanks, but no thanks.

01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:00.561
We're cold, selfish,
and people still love us.

01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:02.729
That's not who I wanna be.

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:05.002
Three cool cats

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:08.847
Three cool cats

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:11.605
May I have this dance?

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:13.523
Parked on the corner in a beat-up car

01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:17.443
Dividing up a nickel candy bar

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:20.964
Talking all about how sharp they are

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:23.362
These three cool cats

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:27.966
Three cool chicks

01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:37.801
Clear.

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:44.645
Rebecca's gonna kill me.

01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:53.127
Hello.

01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:59.526
- "I want that middle chick!"
- "I want that little chick!"

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:02.251
"Hey, man, save one chick for me!"

01:09:03.279 --> 01:09:05.600
Three cool chicks

01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:09.162
Three cool chicks

01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:14.444
Hey, everything all right?

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:18.087
And three cool cats really fell in love

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:22.131
But three cool chicks
made three fools of these

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:24.770
Three cool cats

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:33.009
Three cool cats

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:39.247
You still wanna return the cat?

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.569
No.</font>

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.731
If you want your dad back,
you should get going.

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:53.770
I think he might be running out of time.

01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:58.602
Dad, when they open the tower tonight...

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:14.131
Get down.</font>

01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:17.882
We're not seeing
any cerebral activity at all.

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:20.042
I just don't want to give you false hope.

01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:22.327
There's a possibility
he's not coming back.

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:25.323
Mom, Dad's still here.

01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:26.646
Can you give us a minute?

01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:28.296
You know how the cat's been acting funny?

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:29.731
Well, that's because it's Dad.

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:32.201
- Rebecca...
- Listen, I can prove it.

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:33.731
Let's talk outside.

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:35.960
Come on.

01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:39.649
Mom, I'm not making it up.

01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:43.323
Oh, look, I know how you feel.
I miss him, too.

01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:46.609
You'll see, Mommy.
He's really alive in the cat.

01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:50.125
I screwed up, Dad.

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:51.446
What are you talking about?

01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:55.242
I spent my whole life waiting for
a sign that I was making you proud.

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:56.931
When I finally got it,

01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:59.171
I let you down.

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:01.170
I lost everything.

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:03.686
I can't live with that.

01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:11.530
I don't know if you're still in there,

01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:13.886
but you won't wanna miss this.

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:32.163
'Cause I'm gonna take my first jump.

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:36.850
And my last jump right off of that tower.

01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:38.046
No, David!

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:41.846
Goodbye, Dad. I love you.

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.610
So how does this work?

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:54.726
You'll need to sign a DNR.

01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:56.401
DNR?

01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:58.290
They're pulling the plug on me?

01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:00.362
And then we'll take out the respirator.

01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:01.561
Daddy.

01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:04.491
Mom, remember how me and Dad
used to dance together?

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:06.961
- Yeah.
- Just watch, okay? We'll show you, okay?

01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:08.041
Daddy, come here.

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:10.209
Daddy. Daddy.

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:12.004
We need to show Mommy our dance.

01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:13.321
Come here.

01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:15.761
Daddy.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.650
Love means sacrifice.

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:21.851
Love means sacrifice.

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:23.649
Daddy! Daddy!

01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:26.446
I'm spending the rest
of my life in a litter box.

01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:27.921
Daddy.

01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:29.161
Daddy!

01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:33.049
Daddy! Daddy, come here!
We have to show her!

01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:36.251
- Daddy! Daddy! What are you doing?
- My baby.

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:39.328
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.</font>

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:44.880
Thank you. Isn't she beautiful?

01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:47.720
1,900 feet of glass and steel.

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:50.724
Now, you can tell
I'm a bit of a numbers guy,

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:53.121
so, for me, this tower's
more than a legacy.

01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:57.450
Its 2.8 million square feet
of pristine office space.

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:11.010
Before I even cut a ribbon,

01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:14.801
we've leased 65%
of the tallest building in New York.

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:16.960
And we're already in negotiations
for the rest of it.

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:29.004
We can be so much more.

01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:32.449
But this company is greater
than the sum of its parts.

01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:35.046
Beyond real estate, in the last year,

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:36.963
we've enjoyed record earnings.

01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:39.769
Global retail.</font>

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:41.729
But before we move on
with our big announcement,

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:43.962
we have a special guest
who'd like to say a few words.

01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:45.644
Please welcome Mayor Edwards.

01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:46.926
Thank you, Ian.

01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:50.361
New York...

01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:53.007
We're gonna tell Daddy
how much we love him.

01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:57.321
David?

01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:02.376
- I like to take a moment of...
- Hey.

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:03.765
Wake up in there. Let me in.

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:05.649
For the dreamer
who made all this possible.

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:08.040
Tom Brand.

01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:10.884
Now I'm gonna turn this back to Mr. Cox.

01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:13.804
We all wish Tom was here,
but someone's gotta cut the ribbon.

01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:18.169
Oh, come on!

01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:29.681
Wait!

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.684
Thank goodness you found him.

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:34.046
That thing is yours?

01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:37.249
That's Mr. Fuzzypants. He keeps escaping.

01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:39.569
What kind of name is Fuzzypants?

01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:41.251
Please.

01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:43.281
Thank you.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.286
You little Houdini.

01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:48.328
He won't bother you anymore. I promise.

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:49.686
He tried to scratch me.

01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:52.089
That must have been so scary for you.

01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:54.404
Fuzzypants.

01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:56.041
Thank you.

01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:04.844
That was some bold move you
made back there, Mr. Brand.

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:06.611
Thank you, Perkins.

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:10.886
If it was me,

01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:12.689
I'd have stayed at the hospital.

01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:14.444
Guess I'm moving into your shop.

01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:15.851
No,

01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:18.446
'cause you're not gonna make it.

01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:19.846
What? Wait!

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:30.965
Wait, this is the best part.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.843
Whoa!</font>

01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:38.121
Whoa!

01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:42.761
Whoa.

01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:44.930
- Should we call animal control?
- No.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.161
We got Tasers.

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:48.368
Right. Let's do this.

01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:00.291
All right, kitty, just stand still.

01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:02.966
The sad thing is
I'll never get to fire you.

01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:05.202
We're gonna break the Internet.

01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:11.087
Sorry! Sorry!

01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:13.049
Did you have to set it to boil?

01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:19.246
Look, you idiot.

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:21.241
Oh, God.

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:24.970
We got a man on the roof.
We are gonna need fire, paramedics...

01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:26.326
And animal control.

01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:28.616
We got a man on the roof.
We got a man on the roof.

01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:30.244
Who's on the roof?</font>

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:31.447
He's going to jump!

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:34.841
David.

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:44.851
Don't even think about it.

01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:51.080
Sir, get down from there.

01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:52.764
Step away from the ledge.

01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:56.681
David, wait!

01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:18.961
Oh.

01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:36.445
Mr. Fuzzypants?

01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:50.604
- My son...
- Whoo.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.002
You were a man all along.

01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:17.051
Meow, that hurt.

01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:18.281
- Tom? Tom?
- Dad.

01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:21.651
Oh, baby. Oh, I missed you so much.

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:24.280
Well, it's good to see
Tom's spirit alive and well.

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:26.004
As soon as security takes care of this...

01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:31.567
Come on.

01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:33.450
Whoo!</font>

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:37.765
Good evening, everybody.

01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:41.644
So, I hear Ian doesn't want
to talk about Chicago.

01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:43.936
You know, we may not have
the tallest building,

01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:45.450
but we do have the tallest building

01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:46.931
anyone has ever BASE jumped off.

01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:48.766
Let's hear it for David Brand.

01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:56.051
And I'm proud to announce
that tomorrow, FireBrand...

01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:58.566
FireBrand has always been
a family business

01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:00.688
and nothing is going to change that.

01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:02.410
I see the Board's all here.

01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:03.641
Let's take a vote.

01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:06.327
Fifty-one percent against going public.

01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:08.000
- And you're fired.
- Good luck.

01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:09.929
Thank you very much!</font>

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.809
Ian Cox, ladies and gentlemen.

01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:13.405
Give the little guy a hand.

01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:17.681
Lara?

01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:20.288
David. David, he's awake.

01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:21.606
- Yep.
- Your dad's awake.

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:23.170
Okay, I'll be right there.

01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:26.764
Welcome back, Dad.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.241
No, I can handle the SEC.

01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:33.408
- Just get me on the phone with Goldman...
- Sir...

01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:35.364
- You might want to hang up.
- Excuse me?

01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:37.640
You're not going to like
where this call is going.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.207
Thank you. Sorry, some nutcase.

01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:42.169
Listen, we can still take him to court.

01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:46.647
Ian...

01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:48.801
Ian?

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:50.484
Gotta be honest.

01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:52.760
I don't know
how you're gonna get out of this.

01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:55.051
I hate cats.

01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:58.481
That's what makes this so perfect.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.128
You probably want to hear that
I've learned something,

01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:08.964
that I've changed...

01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:12.087
Well, I still think
cats are horrible beasts

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:14.376
that would eat you in your sleep
if they ran out of food.

01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:16.721
They're selfish animals. That's for sure.

01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:19.168
But I'm not one of them.

01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:20.801
Not anymore.

01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:28.210
Be quiet. Shush.

01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:30.846
Mr. Brand.

01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:33.049
You look like a new man.

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:35.765
What can I do for you?

01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:39.162
I know we can't replace Fuzzypants,

01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:41.004
but we were wondering...

01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:42.809
If you have any dogs.

01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:44.561
No.

01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:48.842
But only yesterday,
an old friend stopped by.

01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:51.368
Used up eight of his lives,

01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:53.090
and he tells me

01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:57.166
he'd like to spend his last life

01:20:58.080 --> 01:20:59.127
with you.

01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:01.971
Fuzzypants.

01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:05.967
So, that's a no on the dog, then.
