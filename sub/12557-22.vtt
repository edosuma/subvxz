11:59.344 --> 12:00.300
GOOD EVENING, SIR.

12:00.386 --> 12:01.717
GERRY?

12:01.804 --> 12:02.965
<i>GREG! GOOD
TO SEE YOU.</i>

12:03.056 --> 12:04.091
SCOTCH?

12:04.182 --> 12:05.593
OF COURSE.

12:05.683 --> 12:07.845
YOU'RE UNUSUALLY
CORDIAL TONIGHT.

12:07.936 --> 12:09.927
THAT IS YOUR S'/I///LEYOU'RE
WEARING, ISN'T IT?

12:10.021 --> 12:11.762
I TOOK IT OUT
OF COLD STORAGE.

12:11.856 --> 12:13.642
VVELL, NOT I. I DON'T PLAN
TO SMILE ALL EVENING.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.940
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU SHARE
MY DISTASTE FOR BIRTHDAYS.

12:16.027 --> 12:18.109
<i>(Greg) WELL, BIRTHDAYS,
ANNIVERSARIES</i>

12:18.196 --> 12:20.062
<i>AND CERTAIN HOLIDAYS I
OVERLOOK WHENEVER POSSIBLE.</i>

12:20.156 --> 12:22.739
THEY SEEM TO IMPLY A CERTAIN
STICKY HUMAN INVOLVEMENT

12:22.825 --> 12:24.441
WHICH I'D MUCH
RATHER AVOID.

12:24.535 --> 12:26.401
IS THAT TRUE? I'D ALVVAYS
GATHERED YOU VVERE

12:26.496 --> 12:28.612
SOMETHING OF A LADIES' MAN,
RATHER THICKLY INVOLVED.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.242
YOU'VE BEEN
MISINFORMED,

12:30.333 --> 12:32.074
I'M MUCH TOO SELFISH
TO FALL IN LOVE.

12:32.168 --> 12:33.954
AND YOU'RE
MISERABLE.

12:34.045 --> 12:36.036
NOT IN THE LEAST.

12:36.130 --> 12:38.087
I \/ALUE THE PEACE AND QUIET OF
MY ORDERLY BACHELOR EXISTENCE.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.791
LETS ME VVRITE MY PLAYS VVITHOUT
INTERFERENCE FROM ANYONE.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.341

IS THE NEW PLAY?

12:42.428 --> 12:44.169

THE BIRTHDAY GIRL?

12:46.307 --> 12:48.514
OH, SHE'S STILL AT
HER MAKEUP TABLE.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.137
HER EMOTIONS
WERE SHOWING,

12:50.228 --> 12:52.310
AND SHE'S COVERING
UP A LITTLE.

12:52.397 --> 12:55.264
TELL ME, VVHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THIS AMUSING LITTLE TOY

12:55.358 --> 12:56.848
I FOUND FOR HER?

12:56.943 --> 12:58.104
I HAVEN'T SEEN ONE
OF THOSE IN YEARS.

12:58.194 --> 12:59.275

DOES IT?

12:59.320 --> 13:00.856
IT DOES, INDEED.

13:00.947 --> 13:03.814
PLAYS REMARKABLY WELL.
LET ME SHOW YOU.

13:03.908 --> 13:06.366
I HAVE A PIECE
ESPECIALLY FOR YOU.

YOU SAY?</i>

13:16.546 --> 13:18.378
IS ESTHER
PLEASED WITH IT?

13:18.464 --> 13:21.547
WELL, SHE HASN'T SHOWN
ANY GREAT ENTHUSIASM.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.716
THAT DOESN'T
SOUND LIKE ESTHER.

13:23.803 --> 13:27.717
USUALLY SHE'S SO GRATEFUL FOR
ANY SMALL SHOVV OF AFFECTION.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.219
<i>I THINK THAT'S ONE OF HER
MOST LOVABLE QUALITIES--</i>

13:30.310 --> 13:32.426
THE ABILITY TO ACCEPT
A BOUQUET OF DAISIES

13:32.520 --> 13:34.477
AS THOUGH THEY WERE
THE RAREST OF ORCHIDS.

13:34.564 --> 13:39.058
I REMEMBER I ONCE GA\/E HER A
SMALL RING, A TURQUOISE RING.

13:39.152 --> 13:42.019
SHE ACCEPTED IT AS IF
IT WERE THE HOPE DIAMOND.

13:42.113 --> 13:46.072
OH, I REMEMBER VVHEN SHE BROUGHT
THAT RING BACK FROM MEXICO CITY.

13:46.159 --> 13:49.072
BUT I SEEM TO RECALL THAT
SHE VVENT THERE ALONE.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.573
YES, YES, SHE DID.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.745
WE RAN INTO EACH
OTHER DOWN THERE.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.334
SHE NEVER MENTIONED IT.

13:54.417 --> 13:56.875
WASN'T THAT RATHER
AN ODD COINCIDENCE?

13:56.961 --> 13:59.248
GERRY, HAS IT EVER
OCCURRED TO YOU

13:59.339 --> 14:02.752
THAT I'M VERY DEEPLY IN
LOVE VVITH YOUR VVIFE?

14:02.842 --> 14:05.425
MY DEAR GREG, I ALWAYS
BELIEVED THAT YOU WERE

14:05.511 --> 14:08.253
ABOUT AS CAPABLE OF PASSION
AS A HEAD OF LETTUOE.

14:08.348 --> 14:11.761
AND ESTHER'S EMOTIONAL POVVER
VVAS THAT OF A NEVVBORN KITTEN.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.433
NOW DON'T SPEAK
OF HER THAT WAY.

14:13.519 --> 14:15.772
I'LL SPEAK OF HER
ANY WAY I PLEASE.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.186
SHE'S MY WIFE.

14:17.273 --> 14:18.604
YOU DON'T KNOW
ESTHER AT ALL.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.227
ESTHER IS
FULL OF LOVE.

14:20.318 --> 14:22.559
HER SKIN IS WARM
AND SOFT LIKE VELVET.

14:22.653 --> 14:25.361
THE SCENT OF HER HAIR IS
ENOUGH TO DRl\/E A MAN VVILD.

14:25.448 --> 14:28.941
AND, HER HANDS ARE GENTLE,
SWEET TO KISS AND TO HOLD.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.025
ESTHER IS MUSIC...

14:30.078 --> 14:31.534

I CAN'T EXPLAIN

14:44.884 --> 14:47.125
IT'S PROBABLY
JUST AS WELL.

14:47.220 --> 14:50.633
I NEVER ENJOYED
DECEIVING YOU, GERALD.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.885
MY DEAR, YOU'RE INCAPABLE
OF DECEIVING ME.

14:52.975 --> 14:54.807
I'VE KNOWN FOR YEARS
OF YOUR CAPACITY

14:54.894 --> 14:57.226
FOR DOING ANY NUMBER
OF SORDID LITTLE THINGS.

14:57.271 --> 14:59.399
<i>THE ONLY REVELATION
THAT'S BEEN MADE TO ME</i>

14:59.482 --> 15:02.565

15:15.081 --> 15:17.072
IT'S NOT SOMETHING
THAT YOU FOOL WITH.

15:17.166 --> 15:18.907
I'M NOT FOOLING
WITH IT, MY DEAR.

15:19.001 --> 15:21.083
I'M USING IT WITH
DEADLY ACCURACY.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.126
HI, MARVIN!

15:26.217 --> 15:27.503
GOOD EVENING,

SCRATCH HER EYES OUT.

16:07.800 --> 16:12.169
