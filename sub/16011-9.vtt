02:03.560 --> 02:04.840
Hi!

02:06.800 --> 02:08.120
Where did you find that?

02:08.160 --> 02:09.600
Um...

02:09.639 --> 02:10.639
the spine on this

02:10.640 --> 02:11.641
is getting loose.

02:11.680 --> 02:13.160
I was wondering if maybe you

02:13.161 --> 02:14.640
know a way to keep it together.

02:18.760 --> 02:20.360
Some glue, maybe.

02:20.400 --> 02:22.760
- Or do what
- everyone else under sixty does,

02:22.800 --> 02:24.880
Just download a copy.

02:24.920 --> 02:26.160
Let's try the glue.

02:26.200 --> 02:27.680
Suit yourself.

02:37.360 --> 02:38.820
How badly do you

02:38.821 --> 02:40.280
want to be my friend?

02:40.320 --> 02:41.760
Like, on a scale

02:41.761 --> 02:43.200
of one to ten, or...

02:43.240 --> 02:44.600
I already know the answer.

02:44.601 --> 02:45.960
Just do what I say.

02:58.480 --> 02:59.680
[Mrs. Hoffstetter] Good.

02:59.720 --> 03:01.800
Now see how that holds.

03:01.840 --> 03:03.420
Excuse me, Miss Hofstetter,

03:03.421 --> 03:05.000
can I ask a question?

03:08.720 --> 03:10.200
Oh. Hi Mia.

03:10.240 --> 03:11.960
I didn't see you there.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.840
- It's okay.
- I have trouble noticing you too,

03:13.880 --> 03:15.920
- What with Violetta's shadow
- on you all the time.

03:28.640 --> 03:30.760
[gasps] No!

03:30.800 --> 03:32.840
Oh dear. Here!

03:58.960 --> 04:00.000
Oh...

04:11.120 --> 04:13.200
Is the book ruined?

04:13.240 --> 04:14.360
No.

04:14.400 --> 04:15.720
Good try, though.

04:17.200 --> 04:19.200
I didn't want to do it.

04:19.240 --> 04:20.680
Then why did you?

04:20.720 --> 04:22.760
Violetta's my friend.

04:22.800 --> 04:25.880
I have to listen to her.

04:25.920 --> 04:27.340
Great. well,

04:27.341 --> 04:28.760
That's all that matters then.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.240
I'm sorry.

04:32.160 --> 04:33.640
Maybe if you just stay

04:33.641 --> 04:35.120
far away from Violetta,

04:35.160 --> 04:36.360
things like this

04:36.361 --> 04:37.560
wouldn't happen.

04:37.600 --> 04:38.960
Yeah... I'll get right on it.

04:56.640 --> 04:57.740
[Mia] How hard is it

04:57.741 --> 04:58.840
to change roommates?

04:58.880 --> 05:00.480
I can't stand living with

05:00.481 --> 05:02.080
Violetta's robot anymore.

05:02.120 --> 05:03.440
Have you tried,

05:03.441 --> 05:04.760
like, talking to her?

05:04.800 --> 05:06.360
Maybe she's not such a drone.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.680
She is. She's one of "them".

05:08.720 --> 05:10.360
- I may as well be
- living with Violetta.

05:11.840 --> 05:13.480
- [Vincent] Violetta wouldn't
- apologize.

05:16.240 --> 05:17.600
Okay, here goes.

05:20.520 --> 05:22.400
- Just so you know,
- when you do this,

05:22.440 --> 05:24.200
It looks awesome.

05:27.640 --> 05:30.000
Hi Mia. Say your password.

05:30.040 --> 05:31.320
"Dark as pitch,

05:31.321 --> 05:32.600
no end in sight...

05:32.640 --> 05:33.980
find a friend,

05:33.981 --> 05:35.320
seek out the light."

05:46.760 --> 05:50.040
[screams]

05:53.680 --> 05:54.760
[grunt]

05:56.320 --> 05:57.480
Sorry, I'm still working

05:57.481 --> 05:58.640
on my landings.

05:58.680 --> 06:00.120
I think they're getting softer.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.840
Yeah, maybe for you.

06:02.960 --> 06:04.400
Where's Onchao?

06:04.440 --> 06:05.720
Odd. He was

06:05.721 --> 06:07.000
just here a minute ago.

06:07.040 --> 06:08.800
He was the one who led us here.

06:08.840 --> 06:10.296
- We were hoping
- he thought there was

06:10.320 --> 06:11.920
- A piece of the Trumptus
- around here.

06:11.960 --> 06:13.000
[Mia] I doubt it.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.520
The oracle said...

06:14.560 --> 06:16.800
"Dark as pitch, no end in sight,

06:16.840 --> 06:18.080
find a friend,

06:18.081 --> 06:19.320
seek out the light."

06:19.360 --> 06:20.700
What darkness?

06:20.701 --> 06:22.040
It's the middle of the day.

06:22.080 --> 06:24.840
Exactly! Oh wait a second.

06:26.760 --> 06:29.600
Hey look! An apple for Onchao.

06:48.400 --> 06:49.440
[growl]

07:08.040 --> 07:09.760
[sniffs]

07:09.800 --> 07:11.680
There he is. Hey, Onchao!

07:11.681 --> 07:13.560
I brought you an apple.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.360
[neighs]

07:18.400 --> 07:20.440
It's good to see you too!

07:22.960 --> 07:24.520
That's weird.

07:24.560 --> 07:27.520
I thought unicorns loved apples.

07:27.560 --> 07:28.660
I wonder what's got him

07:28.661 --> 07:29.760
so preoccupied.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.480
[Mo] Kick it here Onchao.

07:36.600 --> 07:38.360
[grunts]

07:38.400 --> 07:40.880
- I should have known.
- Give a boy a ball to kick and...

07:40.920 --> 07:41.960
[neighs]

07:42.000 --> 07:43.320
[Mo] Over here!

07:44.400 --> 07:45.720
A pass to Mo,

07:45.760 --> 07:47.280
who breaks in all alone.

07:48.160 --> 07:49.400
Wooo!

07:51.520 --> 07:54.200
Uh, that's not a ball, exactly.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.960
[Mo laughs]

07:56.000 --> 07:57.360
Aagh! Wohoo!

07:59.120 --> 08:00.320
[neighs]

08:00.360 --> 08:02.120
Onchao, wait!

08:03.360 --> 08:04.400
[neighs]

08:06.760 --> 08:08.120
Wooo!

08:08.160 --> 08:09.560
Maybe we shouldn't do that...

08:09.600 --> 08:11.800
so near the dragon caves.

08:11.840 --> 08:13.360
So near... what?

08:19.400 --> 08:20.440
[neighs slightly]

08:26.640 --> 08:28.280
Aaagh!

08:28.320 --> 08:29.320
She's getting good at

08:29.321 --> 08:30.321
those landings alright.

08:31.840 --> 08:34.039
Aaaw. A baby dragon!

08:34.080 --> 08:35.559
[Mo] It's so cute.

08:35.600 --> 08:37.120
[growls and bites]

08:37.159 --> 08:38.480
Although, not as much

08:38.520 --> 08:39.720
when it's doing that.

08:39.760 --> 08:41.360
You kicked a dragon egg?

08:41.400 --> 08:42.760
What were you thinking?

08:42.799 --> 08:44.400
That it looked like fun.

08:44.440 --> 08:45.520
I didn't think there was

08:45.521 --> 08:46.600
an actual dragon inside.

08:46.640 --> 08:48.280
We have to get out of here.

08:49.720 --> 08:51.040
[makes noises]

08:51.080 --> 08:52.480
Very slowly...

08:52.520 --> 08:53.960
- and yet,
- very quickly.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.080
C'mon!

08:57.720 --> 08:59.760
[all] Whoaa... ugh!

08:59.800 --> 09:01.200
[roars softly]

09:01.240 --> 09:02.800
[sniffing]

09:02.840 --> 09:04.300
Mo, stop him!

09:04.301 --> 09:05.760
That dragon could bite!

09:07.400 --> 09:09.080
Wait. He's trying to

09:09.081 --> 09:10.760
make friends with it!

09:13.000 --> 09:14.240
- [snorts]
- [squeaks]

09:16.400 --> 09:17.680
[Yuko] Have you ever seen that?

09:17.720 --> 09:19.160
His face is blue.

09:20.440 --> 09:23.480
Okay, that's seriously weird.

09:23.520 --> 09:26.960
A dragon and a unicorn, friends.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.060
[Mia] Now I've officially

09:28.061 --> 09:29.120
seen everything.

09:30.880 --> 09:32.416
- How long are they
- going to keep this up?

09:32.440 --> 09:34.120
[squeaking and snorting]

09:34.160 --> 09:36.000
Well, I guess we might as well

09:36.040 --> 09:38.000
- keep looking for
- the Trumptus piece.

09:38.040 --> 09:39.360
We came here to look.

09:39.361 --> 09:40.680
So let's look.

09:40.720 --> 09:42.560
Any ideas?

09:42.600 --> 09:44.700
The oracle did say

09:44.701 --> 09:46.800
"Dark as pitch, no end in sight,

09:46.840 --> 09:48.060
find a friend,

09:48.061 --> 09:49.280
seek out the light."

09:49.320 --> 09:50.380
Well, we could wait

09:50.381 --> 09:51.440
till night time...

09:51.480 --> 09:53.080
Or, we can start looking now!

09:53.120 --> 09:54.280
[neighing]

09:54.320 --> 09:55.880
It's hard to believe that

09:55.920 --> 09:57.416
- cute little thing
- will one day grow up

09:57.440 --> 09:59.280
- To be one of
- the munculus dragons.

10:10.120 --> 10:11.800
Ahhh, there is

10:11.801 --> 10:13.480
nothing like the raw,

10:13.520 --> 10:16.800
savage ferocity of a dragon!

10:21.760 --> 10:23.280
[snores]

10:23.320 --> 10:24.360
[Panthea] You call that

10:24.361 --> 10:25.400
ferocious?!

10:25.440 --> 10:27.100
My Ziggo here has more fight

10:27.101 --> 10:28.760
in her than they do!

10:28.800 --> 10:30.760
- But, they're
- resting from battle...

10:30.800 --> 10:34.040
Or laziness. I want new dragons!

10:34.080 --> 10:35.320
Yes ma'am.

10:35.360 --> 10:37.440
More dragons mean more unicorns!

10:37.480 --> 10:41.040
I want wild, angry dragons!

10:41.080 --> 10:42.200
Today!

10:42.240 --> 10:43.320
Absolutely ma'm.

10:43.360 --> 10:45.840
Today, if not sooner.

10:57.360 --> 10:59.400
Anything yet?

10:59.440 --> 11:01.880
- [sarcastic] Yeah. I found
- the Trumptus piece an hour ago,

11:01.920 --> 11:03.300
But trudging around in

11:03.301 --> 11:04.680
a stinky swamp is way more fun.

11:04.720 --> 11:06.200
[Mia] Hey guys, look!

11:09.720 --> 11:10.940
That's something

11:10.941 --> 11:12.160
you don't see every day.

11:12.200 --> 11:13.680
We should give him a name.

11:13.720 --> 11:14.740
How about Baby Blue?

11:14.741 --> 11:15.760
Like his face?

11:15.800 --> 11:16.920
[Mo] Huh Baby Blue?

11:16.921 --> 11:18.040
I like that.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.420
[Mia] Look! Onchao's teaching

11:19.421 --> 11:20.760
the little guy to fly!

11:20.800 --> 11:22.120
Maybe you should ask him

11:22.121 --> 11:23.440
for a few pointers.

11:23.480 --> 11:24.560
Very funny.

11:31.200 --> 11:32.640
Yuko, look out...!

11:32.680 --> 11:34.120
[gasps]

11:34.160 --> 11:35.680
Wooooaa...

11:35.720 --> 11:36.920
Ow!

11:38.920 --> 11:40.440
What is this,

11:40.441 --> 11:41.960
'knock Yuko out of the air' day?

11:42.000 --> 11:43.480
[laughing] You have to admit.

11:43.481 --> 11:44.960
That's pretty cute.

11:47.720 --> 11:49.580
Okay, I admit it.

11:49.581 --> 11:51.440
It is cute, for now.

11:51.480 --> 11:52.640
[distant growling]

11:52.680 --> 11:53.880
[gasps]

11:55.160 --> 11:57.040
- What was that?
- What was what?

11:57.080 --> 11:58.160
[distant growling]

11:58.200 --> 12:00.120
[gasps] That!

12:00.160 --> 12:01.420
Dragons. C'mon we've got to

12:01.421 --> 12:02.680
get out of here. Fast.

12:02.720 --> 12:04.560
Wait! I've gotta get Onchao.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.280
Hurry Mia. We don't need

12:06.281 --> 12:07.960
a run-in with the dragons.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.480
C'mon Onchao. We have to hide.

12:10.520 --> 12:12.160
They're getting closer!

12:12.200 --> 12:13.800
He won't leave his new friend.

12:18.520 --> 12:20.580
See? All together.

12:20.581 --> 12:22.640
Like one big happy family.

12:22.680 --> 12:24.360
RRAAAHHRR!

12:26.080 --> 12:27.880
[groans nervously]

12:29.040 --> 12:30.720
They want their baby back.

12:30.760 --> 12:32.720
- Maybe we could show them
- that he's our friend.

12:32.760 --> 12:34.280
Elves and dragons aren't

12:34.281 --> 12:35.800
exactly friends, Mia.

12:35.840 --> 12:36.960
[groans loudly]

12:37.800 --> 12:39.120
[shriek]

12:40.760 --> 12:42.160
Oh no!

12:44.320 --> 12:46.280
On my orders.

12:46.320 --> 12:48.440
Chaaarge!

12:52.080 --> 12:53.380
Don't let

12:53.381 --> 12:54.680
a single dragon escape!

12:57.640 --> 12:59.080
I never thought I'd see the day

12:59.081 --> 13:00.520
I'd be glad to see Gargona.

13:00.560 --> 13:01.920
[Yuko] Me too. But I'm still

13:01.921 --> 13:03.280
rooting for the dragons!

13:03.320 --> 13:04.960
What is she doing here?

13:05.000 --> 13:06.620
My guess? Trying to

13:06.621 --> 13:08.240
capture wild dragons.

13:08.280 --> 13:10.360
Oh! How hard can it be

13:10.361 --> 13:12.440
to catch one of these things!

13:12.480 --> 13:14.260
[grunts] Do I have

13:14.261 --> 13:16.040
to do it myself?

13:16.080 --> 13:17.960
Yee-haa!

13:18.000 --> 13:21.040
Whaaa... [laughs maniacally]

13:24.600 --> 13:25.640
[screams]

13:27.360 --> 13:29.640
Ooomphhhh.

13:29.680 --> 13:30.720
[grunts]

13:32.640 --> 13:33.720
Rahr!

13:38.480 --> 13:40.200
If anyone asks, my dragon broke

13:40.201 --> 13:41.920
a wing, and had to be destroyed.

13:44.360 --> 13:46.260
And if you say any different,

13:46.261 --> 13:48.160
the same will happen to you.

13:53.680 --> 13:55.140
Ugh! That was close.

13:55.141 --> 13:56.600
Muncs and dragons.

13:56.640 --> 13:57.880
I don't know which is worse.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.400
We've got to get out of here.

13:59.440 --> 14:01.240
It's not safe.

14:01.280 --> 14:02.360
We can't leave before

14:02.361 --> 14:03.441
we find the Trumptus piece.

14:03.480 --> 14:05.240
Right! Which means...

14:05.280 --> 14:07.200
- We have to
- get rid of this little guy.

14:09.880 --> 14:10.920
[burps]

14:10.960 --> 14:12.880
Aw yuck.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.360
I can take care of him and

14:14.361 --> 14:15.800
look for the Trumptus piece.

14:15.840 --> 14:17.880
Easy peasy.

14:17.920 --> 14:19.220
Mia, we're in the middle

14:19.221 --> 14:20.520
of dragon territory,

14:20.560 --> 14:22.240
and we have one of their babies.

14:22.280 --> 14:23.480
Not good for

14:23.481 --> 14:24.680
elf-dragon relations.

14:26.480 --> 14:28.176
- It'd be a different story
- if he could sniff out

14:28.200 --> 14:29.520
Pieces of the Trumptus.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.840
- Maybe we don't need to
- worry about that.

14:36.320 --> 14:37.720
[Mia] Onchao!

14:37.760 --> 14:39.480
Onchao?

14:40.520 --> 14:41.720
[Mo] There he is.

14:45.600 --> 14:46.840
Doing only what

14:46.841 --> 14:48.080
Onchao does best.

14:48.120 --> 14:49.640
Ta-da!

14:49.680 --> 14:51.680
A Trumptus piece!

14:51.720 --> 14:54.360
There! What do you say to that?

14:54.400 --> 14:55.700
[distant shrieking]

14:55.701 --> 14:57.000
Mo! Look out.

15:01.440 --> 15:03.000
Mia, run!

15:06.560 --> 15:07.900
Somebody help!

15:07.901 --> 15:09.240
They're after Onchao!

15:09.280 --> 15:10.660
Not Onchao!

15:10.661 --> 15:12.040
They want their baby back!

15:12.080 --> 15:13.800
[grunts]

15:13.840 --> 15:15.096
We've got to get away from here.

15:15.120 --> 15:16.160
[grunts with effort]

15:16.200 --> 15:17.520
Aahh...

15:18.760 --> 15:19.800
[gasps]

15:19.840 --> 15:21.480
[growling]

15:21.520 --> 15:23.400
Ugh! You picked the wrong elves

15:23.440 --> 15:25.240
to mess with, sulphur breath!

15:27.160 --> 15:29.360
You're just making them angrier!

15:29.400 --> 15:30.600
Mo, look out!

15:30.640 --> 15:32.120
[groans]

15:32.160 --> 15:33.280
[Yuko] Mo!

15:34.120 --> 15:35.360
[grunts]

15:35.400 --> 15:37.320
The Trumptus piece. Get it!

15:39.320 --> 15:41.960
I can't. They'll attack Onchao.

15:42.680 --> 15:44.200
RAAAHRR!

15:44.240 --> 15:45.400
[squeals]

15:48.160 --> 15:50.160
Did you see that? Alright!

15:51.800 --> 15:53.560
Here Baby Blue.

15:53.561 --> 15:55.320
Good baby dragon.

15:55.360 --> 15:56.460
Bring the nice

15:56.461 --> 15:57.560
Trumptus piece to...

15:57.600 --> 15:59.320
Wooah!

15:59.360 --> 16:00.840
The Trumptus piece!

16:00.880 --> 16:04.560
[Mia] (GASPS) No! Baby Blue...

16:04.600 --> 16:05.920
aaaww.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.360
- Ouch!
- [gasps]

16:16.400 --> 16:18.160
I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?

16:18.200 --> 16:19.520
The dragon hurt him.

16:19.521 --> 16:20.840
You're just making it worse.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.480
I'm just trying to help.

16:22.520 --> 16:24.160
I know. Just help

16:24.161 --> 16:25.800
a little more gently.

16:25.840 --> 16:28.040
- Do you still
- have that tear pearl I gave you?

16:28.080 --> 16:30.080
He gives them to all the girls.

16:30.120 --> 16:31.560
Which is why he never has one

16:31.561 --> 16:33.000
when he needs it for himself.

16:33.040 --> 16:34.600
Or I could get Onchao

16:34.601 --> 16:36.160
to cry a tear for me.

16:36.200 --> 16:37.620
Onchao's not gonna cry

16:37.621 --> 16:39.040
for that little scratch.

16:39.080 --> 16:40.440
We'll just use mine.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.560
Arrghhoohhhh!

16:49.000 --> 16:50.760
Wow!

16:50.800 --> 16:52.060
[sighs] Thanks.

16:52.061 --> 16:53.320
I owe you one.

16:53.360 --> 16:54.560
[neighs]

16:58.040 --> 16:59.120
Just as I thought,

16:59.121 --> 17:00.200
there's a cave up there.

17:00.240 --> 17:02.040
A dragon lair, huh?

17:02.080 --> 17:03.740
So that's where they took him.

17:03.741 --> 17:05.400
And the Trumptus piece.

17:05.440 --> 17:07.160
Well, say goodbye to that piece.

17:07.200 --> 17:08.619
Why? Can't we just

17:08.621 --> 17:10.040
go in and get it?

17:10.079 --> 17:12.240
Well, aside from the smell...

17:12.280 --> 17:13.920
dragons will kill anything

17:13.921 --> 17:15.560
that comes near their eggs.

17:15.599 --> 17:16.720
Even munculus won't go

17:16.721 --> 17:17.839
into a dragon's lair.

17:17.880 --> 17:19.400
But we need every piece

17:19.440 --> 17:21.136
- if the Trumptus is ever
- going to work again.

17:21.160 --> 17:23.079
- So, let's go in there
- and get it!

17:24.960 --> 17:26.339
[Yuko] Can't we go one whole day

17:26.340 --> 17:27.720
without risking our lives?

17:27.760 --> 17:28.880
[Mia] Come on! How bad

17:28.881 --> 17:30.000
can they be?

17:31.280 --> 17:34.360
Whoa. That really smells.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.160
Don't say I didn't warn you.

17:39.880 --> 17:41.000
Any idea how many dragons

17:41.001 --> 17:42.120
are in there?

17:42.160 --> 17:44.080
- Any number over zero
- is too many.

17:44.120 --> 17:46.020
True. But, you know who's also

17:46.021 --> 17:47.920
in there? Our baby dragon.

17:47.960 --> 17:49.440
Your baby dragon.

17:49.441 --> 17:50.920
With his mother.

17:50.960 --> 17:52.380
And his father, his brothers,

17:52.381 --> 17:53.800
sisters, uncles...

17:53.840 --> 17:55.820
Okay, I get it. Lots.

17:55.821 --> 17:57.800
But one is our friend.

17:57.840 --> 17:59.560
[gasps] The oracle!

17:59.600 --> 18:01.280
I was wrong before.

18:01.320 --> 18:03.220
When the oracle said,

18:03.221 --> 18:05.120
'Dark as pitch',

18:05.160 --> 18:06.680
it has to mean the cave, right?

18:08.360 --> 18:10.120
Okay. 'Find a friend,

18:10.121 --> 18:11.880
seek out the light'.

18:11.920 --> 18:14.080
- I'm not sure
- about the 'light' part but...

18:14.120 --> 18:16.000
The baby dragon is our friend.

18:16.040 --> 18:18.080
He'll help us! C'mon.

18:20.760 --> 18:21.960
[breaths in deeply]

18:27.640 --> 18:31.000
This is soooo gross.

18:31.040 --> 18:32.720
I just hate all this mud.

18:32.760 --> 18:35.800
I'm not so sure this is mud...

18:35.840 --> 18:37.320
If it's all the same to you,

18:37.321 --> 18:38.800
let's just say it's mud.

18:39.840 --> 18:42.440
Ughh, double gross.

18:45.600 --> 18:46.640
[distant growling]

18:46.680 --> 18:48.200
Did you hear that?

18:51.120 --> 18:52.220
[whispering] I think

18:52.221 --> 18:53.320
it's coming closer.

18:53.360 --> 18:55.160
- Here's the plan.
- You distract it,

18:55.200 --> 18:56.976
- While I run in and
- get the Trumptus piece.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.080
Distract it how?

18:58.120 --> 18:59.160
[grumble]

19:02.000 --> 19:04.040
Rahr!

19:04.080 --> 19:05.360
Baby Blue!

19:08.000 --> 19:10.080
[Onchao snorts]

19:10.120 --> 19:11.160
[baby dragon makes noises]

19:12.680 --> 19:14.020
He's trying to lead us.

19:14.021 --> 19:15.360
Let's go.

19:15.400 --> 19:16.600
Aaagh!

19:26.960 --> 19:28.160
[snorts]

19:33.280 --> 19:34.440
[bites]

19:34.480 --> 19:35.920
[growls]

19:38.600 --> 19:40.280
[Mia] Did you see that?

19:40.320 --> 19:41.840
No question. You have

19:41.841 --> 19:43.360
a way with dragons.

19:43.400 --> 19:45.296
- Let's hope so, because
- we're right in the middle

19:45.320 --> 19:46.960
Of a whole herd of them.

19:59.960 --> 20:01.720
It's like...

20:01.721 --> 20:03.480
a dormitory for dragons.

20:03.520 --> 20:04.976
- We don't even know if
- the Trumptus piece

20:05.000 --> 20:06.520
Is actually here.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.080
Onchao would know.

20:09.120 --> 20:10.720
- But I'm not letting him
- in there.

20:16.640 --> 20:17.960
He's gonna ruin everything!

20:18.000 --> 20:21.200
No! He's distracting her.

20:21.240 --> 20:23.040
[Mia] Look, there it is!

20:23.080 --> 20:24.440
Now's our chance.

20:25.320 --> 20:26.520
Got it.

20:27.440 --> 20:28.800
Uh, now what?

20:29.600 --> 20:30.920
[gasps]

20:30.960 --> 20:32.060
- RAAHRRR!

20:32.061 --> 20:33.160
- Waaaaahhhh!

20:35.520 --> 20:36.760
[Mia] Uh Oh!

20:37.840 --> 20:39.400
Just stay calm.

20:39.440 --> 20:41.320
We've been in worse situations.

20:41.360 --> 20:42.780
- You have?

20:42.781 --> 20:44.200
- No, not really.

20:45.640 --> 20:46.880
[groans]

20:46.920 --> 20:48.640
Look! He's trying to show us...

20:48.680 --> 20:49.800
C'mon!

21:01.720 --> 21:02.820
Do you think

21:02.821 --> 21:03.920
we should take him too?

21:03.960 --> 21:05.120
Nope. He belongs here

21:05.121 --> 21:06.280
but we don't!

21:06.320 --> 21:08.160
- Now, let's go!
- [neighs]

21:08.200 --> 21:09.260
Now's not the time

21:09.261 --> 21:10.320
for long good-byes.

21:10.360 --> 21:12.520
- I think I'm gonna be leaving
- by a different way!

21:12.560 --> 21:14.240
You guys go ahead!

21:14.241 --> 21:15.920
And take care of Onchao!

21:19.680 --> 21:20.880
[Mo] Goodbye Baby Blue!

21:22.840 --> 21:24.880
[Mo] Phew! That was close.

21:24.920 --> 21:27.160
But we got the Trumptus piece.

21:27.200 --> 21:29.240
And Mia's back in her world.

21:29.280 --> 21:31.440
Time to go home. C'mon, Onchao!

21:31.480 --> 21:33.120
[neighs]

21:39.080 --> 21:40.440
Still awesome.

21:51.760 --> 21:53.080
Where are you going?

21:53.120 --> 21:54.920
Back to the dragon's den.

22:01.200 --> 22:02.240
[door closes]

22:14.160 --> 22:15.320
Geometry?

22:16.480 --> 22:17.840
Yeah?

22:17.880 --> 22:19.680
It's the one part of math class

22:19.720 --> 22:22.200
I'm actually okay at.

22:22.240 --> 22:23.400
Let me know

22:23.401 --> 22:24.560
if you need any help.

22:24.600 --> 22:25.600
Thanks.
