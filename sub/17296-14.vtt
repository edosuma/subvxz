Good morning, everyone.

00:37.472 --> 00:39.822
What's up with the mustache?

00:39.865 --> 00:41.432
It's Mustache Monday, girl!

00:41.476 --> 00:43.130
Mustache Monday!

00:43.173 --> 00:45.915
Everyone get your mustaches on.

00:52.835 --> 00:54.097
Ooh...

00:54.141 --> 00:55.620
Oh, wow! I wish I could grow
mines like that.

00:55.664 --> 00:56.752
Nice.

00:56.795 --> 00:59.407
Stop that!
It is not Mustache Monday!

00:59.450 --> 01:02.236
That sweet chevron
says otherwise.

01:04.107 --> 01:05.848
Enough!

01:05.891 --> 01:08.111
This mustache is not about style.
It's about authority.

01:08.155 --> 01:12.855
For today, I am your teacher,
and you are my students.

01:13.334 --> 01:14.900
Whoa!

01:21.907 --> 01:23.909
Oh, man! School?

01:23.953 --> 01:25.302
You don't wanna do this.

01:25.346 --> 01:28.044
Yeah, we specifically
avoid going to school.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.306
It is the boring.

01:29.350 --> 01:30.916
Tough!

01:30.960 --> 01:32.701
You are all in dire need
of the critical life skills

01:32.744 --> 01:35.486
that can only be learned
in a classroom environment.

01:35.530 --> 01:37.923
We don't have to stay here.
Let's go.

01:37.967 --> 01:39.186
Fine, leave.

01:39.229 --> 01:41.971
I'll just have to give you
all check marks.

01:43.146 --> 01:44.234
A check mark!

01:44.278 --> 01:45.714
You would not.

01:45.757 --> 01:47.933
Yes, I would.

01:47.977 --> 01:50.545
In fact, every time
you misbehave,

01:50.588 --> 01:52.938
you will earn a check mark
next to your name.

01:52.982 --> 01:57.378
And those check marks will go
on your permanent record.

01:59.336 --> 02:02.339
Yo, my cousin got four check
marks on his permanent record,

02:02.383 --> 02:04.167
and now he lives in a dumpster.

02:04.211 --> 02:05.821
The dumpster?

02:05.864 --> 02:08.345
I don't want to live in a dumpster.
We'd better stay.

02:08.389 --> 02:12.175
Can't believe he pulled out a check mark.
Give me a check mark...

02:12.219 --> 02:14.046
I had no choice.

02:14.090 --> 02:17.137
As you can see, teaching is the
hardest job in the entire world.

02:17.180 --> 02:20.052
Surely it is not harder than the
professional shark fighter.

02:20.096 --> 02:22.011
Yeah.

02:22.054 --> 02:24.492
Teaching's just standing up and
wearing sweaters. That ain't hard.

02:24.535 --> 02:28.365
Oh, if you think teaching is so easy,
I'd like to see you get up and try.

02:28.409 --> 02:29.671
All right, bro.

02:31.325 --> 02:33.109
I's about to get my teach on!

02:34.676 --> 02:35.894
I didn't mean that literally.

02:35.938 --> 02:37.896
Now sit down before
I give you a check mark.

02:37.940 --> 02:39.724
Uh-uh-uh.
I'm the teacher now.

02:39.768 --> 02:42.379
So I gots the chalk,
and you gets the checks.

02:42.423 --> 02:45.077
No, no, no, no!
Okay, I'll do whatever you say.

02:45.121 --> 02:47.689
Then sit down, sir.

02:47.732 --> 02:49.691
'Cause y'all's about
to get schooled!

02:52.737 --> 02:53.956
What up, my students?

02:53.999 --> 02:58.134
I'm Mr. B.
Welcome to Sciences Class.

02:58.178 --> 03:01.659
Science?
You are going to teach us science?

03:01.703 --> 03:03.095
You can't even tie your shoes.

03:03.139 --> 03:05.750
That's right.
'Cause Mr. B don't got laces.

03:08.666 --> 03:10.842
Now stop disrupting my class,
or you gets a check mark!

03:13.367 --> 03:14.803
I don't believe this...

03:14.846 --> 03:17.893
That's better.
Now, what do you kiddy-kids

03:17.936 --> 03:19.895
want to learn about
sciences today?

03:19.938 --> 03:22.419
- Why are buildings so tall?
- How many pancakes can I eat?

03:22.463 --> 03:24.726
Ooh, why is the sky blue?

03:24.769 --> 03:25.857
Good one, Star.

03:25.901 --> 03:27.685
That's today's lesson.

03:27.729 --> 03:31.080
Oh, come on! Everybody knows
the sky is blue

03:31.123 --> 03:34.083
because the sun
reflects the blue ocean.

03:36.738 --> 03:38.566
Nah, son. Nah.

03:38.609 --> 03:39.871
Then why don't you tell us?

03:39.915 --> 03:43.135
I'm not gonna tell you.
I'm gonna show you.

03:54.016 --> 03:56.671
Everybody in the
Magical Learnin' Van, y'all.

03:59.326 --> 04:00.675
A magic van?

04:00.718 --> 04:02.285
There's no magic in science!

04:02.329 --> 04:04.722
Hey, settle down!
You want a check mark?

04:04.766 --> 04:05.984
No.

04:06.028 --> 04:07.638
Then get your butt
in the Magic Van!

04:17.126 --> 04:18.606
Ooh!

04:18.649 --> 04:22.262
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
All right, check it.
Science time!

04:25.482 --> 04:27.267
So, yo, the sun's over there

04:27.310 --> 04:29.704
and it's blowing sunlight
all over the place, right?

04:29.747 --> 04:33.316
Now, that sunlight is all
the colors of the rainbow.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.927
So, in a rainbow
you got blue, right?

04:35.971 --> 04:38.190
So them blues get up in here,

04:38.234 --> 04:39.888
up high around
the Earth ball, okay?

04:39.931 --> 04:42.325
And then they all gets
friendly with the gases.

04:42.369 --> 04:45.285
And all the gases are like,
"What up! What up! What up!"

04:45.328 --> 04:46.851
And then the light that is blue,

04:46.895 --> 04:48.723
they're all like,
"What up, dude?

04:48.766 --> 04:50.246
"How you been?"
And that's how...

04:50.290 --> 04:52.335
You know, that's how
the sky is blue now.

04:55.207 --> 04:58.298
Everything you just said
is nonsense.

04:58.341 --> 05:00.212
No. I get it.

05:00.256 --> 05:02.780
The gas particles high up in the
atmosphere reflect the blue light.

05:02.824 --> 05:05.392
Which gives the sky
its blue color.

05:05.435 --> 05:07.045
That's what's up!

05:07.089 --> 05:10.353
Yo, Mr. B. How come the sky
is orange or red sometimes?

05:10.397 --> 05:12.312
Bro, it's like this.

05:12.355 --> 05:15.358
Up in that rainbow, you gots
red and orange, right?

05:15.402 --> 05:18.230
Well, when the sun goes down, the
blues are all like, "Later,"

05:18.274 --> 05:20.320
'cause they ain't gonna
be up high no more, right?

05:20.363 --> 05:22.670
So, then the oranges and the
reds get all low, low, low,

05:22.713 --> 05:25.020
and other stuff up in there
and all around up in there,

05:25.063 --> 05:28.893
and they're all like, "Yes,
yes, yes, my dude! Yes!"

05:31.896 --> 05:34.203
Oh, so the particles
lower in the atmosphere

05:34.246 --> 05:35.987
reflect the red
and orange light...

05:36.031 --> 05:39.948
Because they travel further
as the earthly sun is setting.

05:39.991 --> 05:42.211
He is speaking gibberish.

05:42.254 --> 05:44.909
Stop interrupting my class.
That's a check mark!

05:48.435 --> 05:51.220
Mmm-mmm-mmm. You need to
get your act together, young man.

05:51.263 --> 05:53.744
That's on ya
permanent record, son.

05:53.788 --> 05:55.180
Oh!

05:55.224 --> 05:56.921
It's not "ya" permanent record.

05:56.965 --> 05:58.662
It's "your" permanent record.

05:58.706 --> 06:01.404
The teacher's not supposed
to need grammar lessons.

06:01.448 --> 06:02.971
Oh, the grammar.

06:03.014 --> 06:06.191
I very much indeed would enjoy
the teaching of the grammars.

06:06.235 --> 06:09.151
Well, you're up then, girl.
You gots the chalk.

06:11.675 --> 06:13.634
Welcome all to the...

06:15.462 --> 06:17.464
Star, no offense,

06:17.507 --> 06:20.118
but you are not qualified
to teach grammar.

06:20.162 --> 06:22.469
Robin, please refrain
from the interruptions.

06:22.512 --> 06:25.950
I do not wish to give you
the mark of the checks.

06:25.994 --> 06:29.345
But if I must, I will.

06:29.389 --> 06:32.304
Okay, okay, okay.
Calm down.

06:32.348 --> 06:36.091
Class, today we will learn
the use of the word "the."

06:36.134 --> 06:40.225
Now, can anyone tell where the
sentence is missing the word "the"?

06:40.269 --> 06:43.098
You don't need
"the" in that sentence.

06:43.141 --> 06:44.882
- Oh, oh, oh!
- Yes, Raven.

06:47.319 --> 06:48.712
Good start.

06:48.756 --> 06:51.498
But the sentence is
still lacking the "the's."

06:54.588 --> 06:57.417
Oh, you are missing
a few more of the "the's."

06:57.460 --> 06:58.983
Hmm. Oh, I gots it.

07:05.337 --> 07:10.473
Oh, yes. The full of the wonders that
you have correctly worded the sentence.

07:10.517 --> 07:12.388
It isn't correct!

07:12.432 --> 07:15.391
The point of grammar
is to communicate clearly.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.654
Who can understand
anyone talking like this?

07:17.698 --> 07:20.788
The Robin the can the not the
under the stand the us the.

07:20.831 --> 07:23.921
The but the we are the
speaking the clearly the.

07:23.965 --> 07:29.013
The some the people the cling the to
the their the own the ignorance the.

07:29.057 --> 07:30.450
The so the sad the.

07:30.493 --> 07:33.104
This is a force of force!

07:33.148 --> 07:35.542
Uh-uh.
It is "the" force, Robin.

07:35.585 --> 07:37.848
You have done
the disrupting of the class.

07:37.892 --> 07:41.243
And I must do the giving
of the mark of the checks.

07:41.286 --> 07:43.463
The no! The no!

07:46.944 --> 07:48.859
It's okay, dude.
Grammar's not your strong suit.

07:48.903 --> 07:51.688
But I think you'll have a
better "reaction and bond"

07:51.732 --> 07:53.821
with the lesson
I'm about to teach.

07:53.864 --> 07:56.432
- Please don't teach chemistry.
- Too late!

07:59.043 --> 08:01.742
Welcome to chemistry.

08:01.785 --> 08:03.526
I'm your teacher, Mr. Cyborg.

08:03.570 --> 08:05.920
But y'all can call me
Dr. Love.

08:05.963 --> 08:07.922
I will not call you
"Dr. Love."

08:07.965 --> 08:10.446
- Dr. Love about to put a check mark on there.
- Fine!

08:10.490 --> 08:13.057
"Dr. Love,"
this is not chemistry.

08:13.101 --> 08:14.885
It's all the same, my love.

09:07.111 --> 09:08.199
You get itchy feet.

Very good, my loves.

09:11.507 --> 09:14.466
This is not chemistry!
This is just a smooth R&B single!

09:14.510 --> 09:16.512
Mmm-mmm-mmm.
That's a check mark.

09:21.648 --> 09:23.040
I'm really stressing out.

09:23.084 --> 09:24.433
I can't take this.

09:24.476 --> 09:26.522
It's cool. I'll teach
the last class of the day.

09:30.961 --> 09:33.616
Okay, I'm Ms. Raven, and
I'm your substitute teacher.

09:33.660 --> 09:35.879
So, just do whatever.
I don't care.

09:43.408 --> 09:46.194
Excuse me, would you guys quiet down
so I can read silently, please?

09:47.543 --> 09:48.762
That's a check mark.

09:48.805 --> 09:50.546
- For what?
- For I don't care.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.156
I'm the sub. Ha!

09:56.247 --> 09:57.727
Oh!

09:57.771 --> 10:00.643
That's four check marks
on your permanent record, son!

10:00.687 --> 10:02.602
No!

10:10.566 --> 10:12.481
Permanent record!

10:12.524 --> 10:13.874
Yee-haw!
