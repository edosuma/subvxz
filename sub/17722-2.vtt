WEBVTT

00:01.133 --> 00:02.400
Erica:
Fighting.

00:02.400 --> 00:05.733
It's like eating,
sleeping, breathing.

00:05.733 --> 00:07.066
We all do it,

00:07.066 --> 00:08.400
just in
our own way.

00:08.400 --> 00:10.000
Oh! Okay, bring it.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.266
Erica: Some say that
the success of a relationship

00:12.266 --> 00:15.466
hinges on
how we resolve conflict.

00:15.466 --> 00:18.400
Like it or not,
how we fight matters.

00:18.400 --> 00:21.400
(playful fighting grunts
and squeals)

00:21.400 --> 00:23.666
(playful
struggling grunts)

00:24.700 --> 00:26.266
What're you doing?

00:26.266 --> 00:27.566
I'm gonna
lick your eyeball.

00:27.566 --> 00:29.433
Ethan: Oh god, no,
not my eyeball!

00:29.433 --> 00:30.566
(cries of protest)

00:31.566 --> 00:33.433
Oh god,
You're dead!

00:33.433 --> 00:35.633
(playful scream)

00:35.633 --> 00:37.666
Don't, Ethan, don't.

00:37.666 --> 00:39.300
Do not,
Do not tickle me!

00:40.300 --> 00:42.000
Don't! Don't!

00:42.000 --> 00:43.300
Don't.

00:53.566 --> 00:55.133
Get a condom.

00:55.133 --> 00:57.166
What? We used the
last one this morning.

00:57.166 --> 00:58.166
What?

00:58.166 --> 00:59.166
Yeah.

00:59.166 --> 01:00.566
No!

01:00.566 --> 01:03.166
It's almost midnight.
I have to get up really early.

01:03.166 --> 01:04.700
(sighs)

01:04.700 --> 01:05.700
Sorry.

01:07.466 --> 01:10.400
You always have
to get up early.

01:11.400 --> 01:13.200
Oh, wait.

01:13.200 --> 01:15.000
Wait. don't move.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.600
I got you something.

01:16.600 --> 01:17.666
Really?

01:17.666 --> 01:20.166
(Erica hums teasingly,
Ethan chuckles)

01:21.166 --> 01:22.700
What is it?

01:22.700 --> 01:24.000
Well,

01:24.000 --> 01:26.166
you know how you always
have to rush home

01:26.166 --> 01:28.300
to shower and shave?

01:29.433 --> 01:31.300
Now you don't have to.

01:32.300 --> 01:33.000
Hey.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.333
Isn't it cute?

01:34.333 --> 01:35.366
Thanks.

01:37.166 --> 01:38.000
Oh.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.133
And I was
thinking that--

01:41.133 --> 01:42.600
You should keep
some clothes here.

01:42.600 --> 01:44.200
I have room
in the closet.

01:44.200 --> 01:48.066
I mean it definitely doesn't
look like it, but--

01:48.066 --> 01:50.233
Sounds like
I'm moving in.

01:50.233 --> 01:52.366
Well, I mean
if you think about it,

01:52.366 --> 01:54.300
it doesn't actually
make sense

01:54.300 --> 01:57.100
for you to be paying
rent next door.

01:57.100 --> 02:01.000
Not when you're spending
every night here.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.166
What's wrong?
The toothbrush too small?

02:04.166 --> 02:05.500
No, no,
it's great, thanks.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.000
It's just, um,
you're right.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.366
It doesn't make sense
that I never sleep at home.

02:09.366 --> 02:10.633
Maybe I
should sometime.

02:10.633 --> 02:11.766
(laughs)

02:14.133 --> 02:15.733
Are you serious?

02:15.733 --> 02:19.333
Hey, it's not that
I don't like sleeping here.

02:19.333 --> 02:20.466
Oh look, hey,

02:20.466 --> 02:24.366
you don't have
to explain yourself to me.

02:24.366 --> 02:27.300
I'm not gonna stop you
from sleeping at your place.

02:27.300 --> 02:30.066
If you want to,
you should.

02:30.066 --> 02:31.133
Tonight even.

02:31.133 --> 02:31.633
Ethan: Erica.

02:31.633 --> 02:32.766
Erica: What?

02:32.766 --> 02:35.666
Why are you making this
such a big thing?

02:35.666 --> 02:37.333
I'm sorry.

02:37.333 --> 02:38.600
I'm not, I--

02:40.266 --> 02:42.400
Really, Ethan,
I'm just--

02:42.400 --> 02:43.433
(sighs)

02:43.433 --> 02:46.433
I'm just tired
and I'm being dumb.

02:46.433 --> 02:48.733
It's totally fine.

02:48.733 --> 02:49.733
We're good?

02:49.733 --> 02:51.433
Yeah.

02:51.433 --> 02:52.766
Totally.

02:52.766 --> 02:55.766
Ethan: Okay, good,
I'm gonna jump in the shower.

02:55.766 --> 02:58.166
Erica: Conflict and
relationships,

02:58.166 --> 02:59.666
they go hand in hand.

02:59.666 --> 03:02.533
Too bad then that most of us
will do almost anything

03:02.533 --> 03:04.666
to avoid confrontation.

03:54.666 --> 03:55.733
(sighs)

04:00.633 --> 04:02.300
Hey, where'd you go
this morning?

04:02.300 --> 04:05.000
Ethan: Oh, I had to go to the
bank and now I'm running late.

04:05.033 --> 04:06.000
Can I
call you later?

04:06.000 --> 04:09.233
Sure. you know that it's
Sam's birthday party tonight?

04:09.233 --> 04:10.333
Oh. that's tonight?

04:10.333 --> 04:11.733
You didn't
make other plans.

04:11.733 --> 04:14.133
Ethan: Well, I was gonna
see Michael for drinks.

04:14.133 --> 04:15.233
It's fine.
I'll cancel.

04:15.233 --> 04:17.533
What time do you want me
to meet you there?

04:17.533 --> 04:18.733
It's at your mom's,
right?

04:18.733 --> 04:20.566
Meet me there?
Well, I thought that--

04:20.566 --> 04:22.733
Never mind,
Uh, 7:00?

04:22.733 --> 04:24.666
Ethan: Great,
see you tonight.

04:24.666 --> 04:25.666
(sighs)

04:27.133 --> 04:28.400
Uh... bye.

04:33.766 --> 04:35.133
Female barista:
Chai latte.

04:35.133 --> 04:36.500
Male barista: All right,
who's next?

04:37.500 --> 04:38.500
There you are, sir.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.200
(dishes clank)

04:44.200 --> 04:45.133
Excuse me?

04:45.133 --> 04:46.666
Yeah,
what can I get you?

04:46.666 --> 04:48.366
Uh, just, um,
just a latte.

04:48.366 --> 04:49.166
A small latte.

04:49.166 --> 04:50.633
Small latte.

04:50.633 --> 04:52.600
I-I don't think that
we've officially met,

04:52.600 --> 04:54.566
I'm Erica.

04:54.566 --> 04:56.100
Oh, hi,
I'm Kai.

04:57.100 --> 04:58.600
Kai,
that's a cool name.

04:58.600 --> 05:00.066
Thank you.

05:00.766 --> 05:02.633
You don't remember me,
do you?

05:02.633 --> 05:04.766
I was the
vanilla syrup girl.

05:04.766 --> 05:06.000
I ordered a latte

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
and then you went
to the supply closet

05:08.000 --> 05:09.700
to get the syrup
and you--

05:09.700 --> 05:12.166
I'm just wondering
what you were doing in there.

05:12.166 --> 05:13.400
I mean,
I'm not wondering.

05:13.400 --> 05:16.733
I think that I know
what you were doing--

05:17.633 --> 05:19.766
Because I do it too.

05:19.766 --> 05:21.666
Here's your latte,
pay at the cash.

05:21.666 --> 05:25.166
Kai, have you ever
been in therapy?

05:31.466 --> 05:33.466
Hey, you want
a top-up?

05:37.300 --> 05:39.533
Um, sorry,
excuse me.

05:42.433 --> 05:44.166
Yes, how much
is the coffee?

05:44.166 --> 05:45.166
Male barista:
Uh, $2.50.

05:50.266 --> 05:50.766
(clears throat)

05:50.766 --> 05:51.766
Hey.

05:54.100 --> 05:55.566
Poor Brent.

05:55.566 --> 05:57.366
No kidding.

05:57.366 --> 05:59.466
He is
in a serious funk.

05:59.466 --> 06:01.066
Twenty bucks says
he either quits

06:01.066 --> 06:02.033
or gets fired.

06:02.033 --> 06:03.266
No, don't say that,
he just--

06:03.266 --> 06:04.700
He just needs
a little time.

06:04.700 --> 06:05.633
Meeri:
Mmm.

06:05.633 --> 06:08.000
He really
wanted this book.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.466
Julianne:
Brent? In my office, please.

06:11.466 --> 06:12.500
Meeri:
Oh, speaking of.

06:12.500 --> 06:14.500
Julianne wanted me
to set up a meeting

06:14.500 --> 06:16.066
with some
high profile writers.

06:16.066 --> 06:19.000
Drinks in the evenings,
a little chitchat.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.300
Tonight works.

06:20.300 --> 06:22.100
No, I can't do tonight,
can you make it tomorrow?

06:22.100 --> 06:24.100
Oh, you got plans
with the bf?

06:24.100 --> 06:25.233
Actually, my mom,

06:25.233 --> 06:26.766
she's throwing this party
for my sister,

06:26.766 --> 06:27.766
it's her 30th,

06:27.766 --> 06:29.000
and Ethan's coming.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.233
As your date!

06:31.233 --> 06:33.366
Righteous!

06:33.366 --> 06:35.033
Yeah,
it kind of is.

06:36.066 --> 06:38.066
I mean, it's the first
big family thing

06:38.066 --> 06:39.633
that he's coming to--

06:39.633 --> 06:40.633
As my boyfriend.

06:40.633 --> 06:42.100
Meeri:
Oh.

06:42.100 --> 06:43.100
Cute.

06:44.200 --> 06:45.633
Okay,

06:45.633 --> 06:47.633
what's the dealio?

06:47.633 --> 06:48.633
I'm sorry?

06:48.633 --> 06:50.133
Brent,
we're adults here,

06:50.133 --> 06:53.033
I think we should be able
to have a frank conversation

06:53.033 --> 06:54.266
about this.

06:54.266 --> 06:56.300
I honestly have no idea
what you're talking about.

06:56.300 --> 06:58.166
Hello?
The sex book?

06:59.166 --> 07:00.466
You're upset.
I get it.

07:00.466 --> 07:01.633
I'm not upset.

07:01.633 --> 07:03.466
I'm fine.

07:03.466 --> 07:05.733
You're a good editor.

07:05.733 --> 07:08.600
But your last book
was late.

07:09.666 --> 07:12.766
And frankly,

07:12.766 --> 07:14.633
Kinda lacklustre.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.566
You just need to
step up your game.

07:17.566 --> 07:20.166
You gotta
get back on top.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Okay.

07:23.400 --> 07:25.333
Okay?

07:25.333 --> 07:26.600
That's it?

07:27.600 --> 07:30.366
I will do my best
to step it up.

07:30.366 --> 07:33.633
I apologize
for disappointing you.

07:35.133 --> 07:36.133
Fine.

07:37.666 --> 07:39.233
Go.

07:39.233 --> 07:40.233
Thank you.

07:43.066 --> 07:46.466
(muted chatter and music
within the house)

07:47.566 --> 07:49.366
(blows out breath)

07:55.233 --> 07:56.200
Barbara: Hey, sweetie.

07:56.200 --> 07:57.633
Erica: Hi, mom.

07:58.100 --> 07:59.000
Gary: Hi, honey.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.166
Erica: Hi, dad.

08:00.166 --> 08:00.733
Where's Ethan?

08:00.733 --> 08:01.766
(clears throat)

08:01.766 --> 08:03.566
I don't know,
he was supposed to here.

08:03.566 --> 08:05.500
Hey, chief!
Glad you could make it.

08:05.500 --> 08:07.266
Ethan:
Nice to see ya.

08:07.266 --> 08:08.666
What took you
so long?

08:08.666 --> 08:10.433
Oh, uh,
traffic was terrible.

08:10.433 --> 08:11.433
I'm sorry.

08:15.266 --> 08:17.100
Roberta:
I am so happy for you.

08:17.100 --> 08:18.566
Honestly,
when your mother told me

08:18.566 --> 08:20.266
I thought,
"how perfect is that?!"

08:20.266 --> 08:21.700
Aw, thanks,
Aunt Roberta.

08:21.700 --> 08:23.500
Barbara: Roberta! You better not
be asking about marriage.

08:23.500 --> 08:24.633
Roberta:
Speaking of marriage,

08:24.633 --> 08:26.500
I'm planning a cruise
to Alaska next summer

08:26.500 --> 08:28.166
and I don't wanna
miss anything.

08:28.166 --> 08:30.766
I'll be sure to give you
lots of advanced notice.

08:30.766 --> 08:34.100
(contemporary jazz plays,
low hum of chatter)

08:34.100 --> 08:35.366
(light scuffle of feet)

08:35.366 --> 08:38.266
Oh, hey!
Oh, that's just great.

08:38.266 --> 08:40.500
Your parents better hope
that egg comes outta Gucci,

08:40.500 --> 08:41.600
kids.

08:41.600 --> 08:42.666
Get used to it.

08:42.666 --> 08:44.600
Those are going to be
our little ones

08:44.600 --> 08:46.400
running around
in a couple of years.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.000
If our kids
act like that

08:48.000 --> 08:49.600
they're gonna
be kept on a leash.

08:49.600 --> 08:51.000
They're gonna
be so cute.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.600
With, uh, blonde hair
and green eyes.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.000
You know, I'm gonna take
a couple years off

08:55.000 --> 08:58.500
and mom'll babysit
whenever we need her to.

08:58.500 --> 09:02.033
We'll find a bigger house
with a nice backyard.

09:02.033 --> 09:03.466
You okay?

09:03.466 --> 09:04.733
Yeah.

09:04.733 --> 09:05.733
Oh. thanks.

09:06.733 --> 09:08.200
(mimics whip lashing)

09:08.200 --> 09:09.133
Stop it.

09:09.133 --> 09:10.166
It's a disaster.

09:10.166 --> 09:11.566
He doesn't want children
and she does.

09:11.566 --> 09:12.466
Barbara: Divorce.

09:12.466 --> 09:13.400
Erica: Mm,
that's terrible.

09:13.400 --> 09:15.066
Roberta:
Yeah, it's awful.

09:15.066 --> 09:16.766
That's why I think you have
to talk about these things

09:16.766 --> 09:18.000
before you get
married.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.333
(coughs)

09:19.333 --> 09:20.400
Excuse me.

09:20.400 --> 09:21.633
Something went down
the wrong way.

09:21.633 --> 09:23.566
Oh,
are you okay?

09:23.566 --> 09:25.166
Ethan:
Yeah.

09:28.566 --> 09:30.100
He so handsome,
he's darling.

09:30.100 --> 09:31.133
I know.

09:34.566 --> 09:36.166
(breathes heavily)

09:38.366 --> 09:39.433
(keys jingle)

09:40.766 --> 09:42.000
(radio plays)

09:53.666 --> 09:54.700
(hum of
guests chatting)

09:54.700 --> 09:55.533
Ethan?

09:55.533 --> 09:56.333
(knocks on door)

10:03.500 --> 10:04.700
Hey,
where've you been?

10:04.700 --> 10:07.366
You went to the bathroom
like a half an hour ago.

10:07.366 --> 10:09.100
Oh, I just needed
some air.

10:09.100 --> 10:10.300
Barbara:
everyone,

10:10.300 --> 10:11.433
I need your attention!

10:11.433 --> 10:13.400
We're gonna take a picture
of the family.

10:13.400 --> 10:17.266
So, I need everyone to gather
over here please.

10:17.266 --> 10:19.066
So you just left
without telling me?

10:19.066 --> 10:21.266
I didn't think I needed
to let you know

10:21.266 --> 10:22.666
every time
I leave the room.

10:22.666 --> 10:24.333
Ethan?!

10:24.333 --> 10:26.400
Barbara: Ethan, why don't you
come around here, sweetheart.

10:26.400 --> 10:28.000
And, Josh,
you're next to Sam,

10:28.000 --> 10:30.266
who's in the middle.

10:30.266 --> 10:31.366
Good.

10:31.366 --> 10:33.133
Ethan: You know, you should be
in the picture, Barb.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.533
I'll take it,
I don't mind.

10:34.533 --> 10:36.533
No, no, no.
It's on a timer, honey.

10:36.533 --> 10:37.766
No,
let him take it.

10:37.766 --> 10:39.133
I'm serious.

10:39.133 --> 10:40.366
If he doesn't wanna
be in the picture.

10:40.366 --> 10:41.566
Maybe he
needs some air.

10:41.566 --> 10:43.500
I didn't realize
it had a timer.

10:43.500 --> 10:45.566
I was just trying
to help out. Sorry.

10:45.566 --> 10:47.733
You think it's tough
dating a Strange?

10:47.733 --> 10:49.500
Try marrying one.

10:49.500 --> 10:51.700
(Josh and guests
chuckle politely)

10:51.700 --> 10:52.700
Is everybody ready?

10:52.700 --> 10:54.300
Ready, mom,
just take the picture.

10:54.300 --> 10:55.000
Gary: Ready.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.300
Barbara: Okay.

10:56.300 --> 10:57.700
One, two, three.

10:59.300 --> 11:00.566
Cheese!

11:00.566 --> 11:01.700
(click)

11:01.700 --> 11:03.300
Can I talk to you?

11:05.200 --> 11:06.466
Gary: That was good.

11:07.066 --> 11:08.066
What is your problem?!

11:08.066 --> 11:09.266
I don't have a problem.

11:09.266 --> 11:10.200
Yes you do.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.066
I don't see why
you have to make

11:12.066 --> 11:13.466
a big deal
out of everything.

11:13.466 --> 11:15.066
Oh! I'm making
a big deal?

11:15.066 --> 11:16.266
You sulked through
every conversation,

11:16.266 --> 11:18.700
and then you go missing
for a half an hour,

11:18.700 --> 11:20.700
and now you're bailing
on a simple picture?!

11:20.700 --> 11:21.766
I mean,
honestly, Ethan,

11:21.766 --> 11:23.700
if being my boyfriend
is such a burden--

11:23.700 --> 11:24.533
You're being
ridiculous!

11:24.533 --> 11:26.000
I am not!

11:26.000 --> 11:27.766
Be honest, do you even wanna
be in this relationship?

11:27.766 --> 11:30.233
'cause you sure as hell
aren't acting like it.

11:30.600 --> 11:33.066
(exhales,
taken aback)

11:34.200 --> 11:37.333
Oh.

11:37.333 --> 11:38.700
That's great.

11:38.700 --> 11:39.700
(frustrated grunt)

11:45.433 --> 11:47.033
Help! Would you
please tell me

11:47.033 --> 11:48.766
why my boyfriend is being
a passive-aggressive,

11:48.766 --> 11:50.033
insensitive,
game-playing.

11:50.033 --> 11:52.166
Dr. Tom: Ah,
"the course of true love

11:52.166 --> 11:54.133
never did run smooth."

11:54.133 --> 11:56.266
William shakespeare.

11:59.666 --> 12:00.533
Dr. Tom: What?

12:00.533 --> 12:02.766
Erica: Nothing.

12:02.766 --> 12:05.500
Just, it's good
to be back here.

12:08.733 --> 12:09.733
Anyway..

12:09.733 --> 12:10.533
(exhales)

12:10.533 --> 12:12.000
Ethan--

12:12.000 --> 12:13.400
Every time he doesn't
like something,

12:13.400 --> 12:14.433
he runs away.

12:14.433 --> 12:15.600
I mean, it's impossible
to communicate

12:15.600 --> 12:17.200
when the other person
is constantly--

12:17.200 --> 12:19.133
Oh, is that what
you were trying to do?

12:19.133 --> 12:19.733
Communicate?

12:19.733 --> 12:21.100
Yes.

12:21.100 --> 12:22.100
Obviously.

12:22.100 --> 12:23.500
Hmm.

12:23.500 --> 12:25.100
Ah.

12:25.100 --> 12:28.033
Malcolm Abrams.
Camp Waquini.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.533
Malcolm.
I haven't--

12:30.533 --> 12:32.600
I haven't seen
that guy in years.

12:32.600 --> 12:34.266
Well, he was
your best friend.

12:34.266 --> 12:37.133
Until he
turned into Satan.

12:37.133 --> 12:40.000
Wow, that sounds familiar,
doesn't it?

12:41.000 --> 12:42.666
Malcolm and I met
at Camp Waquini

12:42.666 --> 12:43.766
when we were kids.

12:43.766 --> 12:47.266
We'd, you know,
spend hours talking,

12:47.266 --> 12:49.533
just sitting
on the docks.

12:50.533 --> 12:53.200
Our senior year
had started off great.

12:53.200 --> 12:55.566
Erica: He'd smuggled
some weed into camp

12:55.566 --> 12:57.566
and I used to
tease him about it

12:57.566 --> 13:01.233
'Cause he was
so not the type.

13:01.233 --> 13:03.166
And we'd sneak off
into the woods

13:03.166 --> 13:05.566
and get high and--

13:05.566 --> 13:08.433
Laugh until
our stomachs hurt.

13:08.433 --> 13:10.466
It didn't take long
for our relationship

13:10.466 --> 13:12.433
to turn romantic.

13:14.233 --> 13:16.633
And that's when
it all fell apart.

13:16.633 --> 13:18.600
How?

13:18.600 --> 13:20.566
I don't really know.

13:20.566 --> 13:22.433
I thought it was going
really well,

13:22.433 --> 13:25.566
but then out of the blue,
he dumped me.

13:25.566 --> 13:27.333
No explanation.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.433
And the next day he hooked up
with some 14-year-old.

13:31.433 --> 13:33.100
What's
Rachel Zimmerman.

13:34.566 --> 13:37.400
I mean overnight he changed.
He wouldn't even talk to me.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.033
So, to get
back at him,

13:39.033 --> 13:41.400
I kind of called him
a "cradle robber."

13:41.400 --> 13:44.333
(muted chatter
and laughter)

13:45.333 --> 13:46.533
Hmm, creative.

13:46.533 --> 13:50.066
Yup. I was pretty
pleased with myself.

13:50.066 --> 13:51.633
Until he framed me.

13:51.633 --> 13:53.200
He framed you?

13:53.200 --> 13:55.433
He planted
his discman,

13:55.433 --> 13:57.666
his boxer shorts,
a lock of his hair.

13:57.666 --> 13:59.200
In my stuff.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.666
And then he told everyone
that he'd been robbed

14:00.666 --> 14:02.466
and that it must
be his stalker.

14:02.466 --> 14:04.133
So, when they
searched my cabin,

14:04.133 --> 14:06.200
they found it all.

14:06.200 --> 14:07.766
I was sent home.

14:07.766 --> 14:10.100
And I was
labelled a thief.

14:10.100 --> 14:14.066
And the next year
I wasn't asked back as staff.

14:14.066 --> 14:16.100
Still bothers
me today.

14:16.100 --> 14:18.100
How he could turn on me
like that?

14:18.100 --> 14:20.633
How overnight he could go
from being my best friend

14:20.633 --> 14:22.733
to my worst enemy.

14:22.733 --> 14:23.733
And this time?

14:25.366 --> 14:26.633
I'd rather
just ignore him.

14:26.633 --> 14:28.333
I provoked him
with the flag

14:28.333 --> 14:30.766
and it got me kicked out.
It wasn't worth it.

14:30.766 --> 14:32.366
(inhales
and exhales)

14:32.366 --> 14:35.366
if I could rewrite
my history,

14:35.366 --> 14:38.500
I would just
enjoy the summer,

14:38.500 --> 14:40.133

17:51.700 --> 17:53.300
And you obviously
have a thing

17:53.300 --> 17:54.366
for dumb
14-year-olds.

17:54.366 --> 17:56.100
Just shut up, okay, man?
You're a virgin,

17:56.100 --> 17:58.166
I have a girlfriend
with no gag reflex.

17:58.166 --> 18:00.566
Look, I don't know what
you're so afraid of, man.

18:00.566 --> 18:02.366
What do you think
they're gonna do?

18:02.366 --> 18:03.333
Compare notes?

18:03.333 --> 18:04.566
Talk about how small
your dick is?

18:04.566 --> 18:07.666
♪

18:07.666 --> 18:09.000
Erica.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.700
Move over.

Sorry!

19:01.633 --> 19:03.233
Next time
you're on tape duty.

19:03.233 --> 19:04.266
No offense, but--

19:04.266 --> 19:05.700
No, I know.
I totally suck.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.333
Erica?

19:10.333 --> 19:11.333
What?

19:11.333 --> 19:12.400
Look, the summer,
it's too short

19:12.400 --> 19:14.100
to be spending it
fighting with you,

19:14.100 --> 19:16.500
so truce?

19:17.633 --> 19:19.133
Um, yeah.

19:21.566 --> 19:23.766
I mean, okay,
definitely.

19:24.233 --> 19:25.166
Cool.

19:25.166 --> 19:26.566
Cool.

19:26.566 --> 19:28.500
Gibby: All right, up next
we've got the senior boys

19:28.500 --> 19:31.200
with mc hammer's
"Can't Touch This."

19:31.200 --> 19:32.766
(screaming and hollering)

19:32.766 --> 19:35.066
You're gonna stick around
for our show, right?

19:35.066 --> 19:37.300
Okay.

19:37.300 --> 19:39.233
(children
cheer wildly)

19:46.300 --> 19:47.000
What's up?

19:47.000 --> 19:48.100
Uh, nothing.

19:48.100 --> 19:49.400
I just have to go
check on something.

19:49.400 --> 19:50.600
I'll be right back,
okay?

19:50.600 --> 19:51.600
Okay.

20:07.200 --> 20:08.200
(walkman clatters)

20:18.733 --> 20:20.033
Dr. Tom:
Hello there!

20:20.033 --> 20:21.333
Oh god!

20:21.333 --> 20:25.000
Dr. Tom: Beautiful day
for an air band.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Oh, you don't
look happy.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
He did it again,
that little shit!

20:29.000 --> 20:30.600
He calls a truce
and then he--

20:30.600 --> 20:32.533
Stabs me
in the back.

20:32.533 --> 20:34.666
Strange,
I wonder why he did that?

20:34.666 --> 20:36.400
Because he's crazy!

20:36.400 --> 20:37.600
Jenny and
Sari were right,

20:37.600 --> 20:39.200
I've been doing
this all wrong.

20:39.200 --> 20:41.200
It's like--
It's like he's an animal.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.566
He senses
my weakness

20:42.566 --> 20:45.533
and then just
goes for the jugular.

20:46.533 --> 20:48.400
I need
to fight back.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.266
You know,
Martin Luther King said,

20:50.266 --> 20:52.566
"returning violence
with violence

20:52.566 --> 20:54.333
only multiplies
violence."

20:54.666 --> 20:56.200
No, uhn-uhn,
I am sorry,

20:56.200 --> 20:57.400
but there is a flaw
in that theory.

20:57.400 --> 20:59.666
Oh, Dr. King got
it wrong, I guess.

20:59.666 --> 21:02.233
Well, please
enlighten me.

21:02.233 --> 21:05.266
The cycle of violence continues
only until someone wins.

21:05.266 --> 21:06.000
Ah.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.266
I didn't get
kicked out last time

21:07.266 --> 21:08.466
because
I fought back,

21:08.466 --> 21:10.700
I got kicked out
because I didn't go far enough.

21:10.700 --> 21:12.133
I lost.

21:12.133 --> 21:14.733
This time, I am gonna win.
I stay and he goes.

21:14.733 --> 21:18.000
Right, so, the solution
is winning then?

21:18.000 --> 21:19.266
Yes, yes it is.

21:19.266 --> 21:20.700
Because I've done
everything else,

21:20.700 --> 21:22.700
so if there's another option,
please feel free,

21:22.700 --> 21:24.200
but I don't see it.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.433
Malcolm will not stop
until I am kicked out.

21:26.433 --> 21:27.600
(laughs)

21:27.600 --> 21:29.266
You can throw your riddles
at me all you want.

21:29.266 --> 21:31.166
Honestly, I am getting
to the point

21:31.166 --> 21:32.300
where I don't care.

21:32.300 --> 21:33.700
One of us
has to go

21:33.700 --> 21:35.733
and this time
it's not gonna be me.

21:35.733 --> 21:37.033
Okay.

21:37.033 --> 21:38.300
He's going down!

21:40.066 --> 21:42.033
Girl: You're
a good dancer.

21:42.033 --> 21:43.300
I am
a good dancer.

21:43.300 --> 21:46.200
You haven't even
seen me do it.

21:46.200 --> 21:48.200
So who are you
sharing a tent with?

21:48.200 --> 21:50.400
Ah, I don't know.
Probably jenny.

21:50.400 --> 21:52.066
Cool. yeah,
I'm sharing with Malcolm.

21:52.066 --> 21:53.333
(laughing)

21:53.333 --> 21:55.200
Beezer: Yeah, I don't know,
ever since you guys broke up,

21:55.200 --> 21:57.000
he's been
kinda weird.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.600
Dude's always been
a little bit paranoid,

21:58.600 --> 21:59.566
you know?

21:59.566 --> 22:01.333
Yeah, no kidding.

22:01.333 --> 22:02.766
Now he's paranoid
and mean.

22:02.766 --> 22:04.600
I don't know what
happened to him.

22:04.600 --> 22:06.433
Malcolm: Yo, beez,
we gonna get going?

22:06.433 --> 22:07.633
Or you
gonna sit around

22:07.633 --> 22:09.233
drooling over
my ex all day?

22:09.233 --> 22:11.366
(caustic laughter)

22:11.366 --> 22:13.200
Gibby: Girls, start
packing up your canoes.

22:13.200 --> 22:15.133
Come on, guys.
Malcolm?

22:15.133 --> 22:19.366
Can I talk to you
for a second?

22:19.366 --> 22:21.700
This morning I received
an anonymous note,

22:21.700 --> 22:24.666
it said that you've
got drugs in your cabin.

22:24.666 --> 22:26.300
Is that true?

22:27.333 --> 22:29.266
No.

22:29.266 --> 22:31.033
I'm telling you,
it's not true.

22:31.033 --> 22:34.033
If we find anything,
you're on the first bus home.

22:34.033 --> 22:35.600
You got it?

22:35.600 --> 22:37.266
(water laps gently)

22:44.233 --> 22:46.633
Sari: I bet it has something
to do with Rachel.

22:46.633 --> 22:48.633
She looked like she
was crying this morning.

22:48.633 --> 22:52.500
Jenny: Yeah, her eyes
looked kinda puffy.

22:52.500 --> 22:53.500
Erica.

22:54.733 --> 22:56.500
Can I talk to you?

22:56.500 --> 22:58.066
Alone?

22:58.066 --> 22:59.766
Grab your pack.

22:59.766 --> 23:01.433
(clears throat)

23:01.433 --> 23:02.433
(oar clatters)

23:03.533 --> 23:05.233
Nice try, but you think
I'm stupid enough

23:05.233 --> 23:06.633
to keep drugs
in my cabin?

23:06.633 --> 23:08.100
Fine.
So, what is this?

23:08.100 --> 23:10.300
Is it you just rubbing
it in my face?

23:10.300 --> 23:12.300
Is that the whole point
of this conversation?

23:12.300 --> 23:14.133
No. I just think
we should agree

23:14.133 --> 23:15.533
to stay away
from each other.

23:15.533 --> 23:17.733
Malcolm, you were
the one to call a truce

23:17.733 --> 23:18.733
and broke it.

23:18.733 --> 23:20.200
So, forget it!

23:20.200 --> 23:21.600
I don't trust anything
you say.

23:21.600 --> 23:24.400
You've driven me to the point
where I'm acting like you.

23:24.400 --> 23:25.400
It's disgusting.

23:25.400 --> 23:27.466
Oh, that's funny,
I'm the problem

23:27.466 --> 23:29.366
and you're totally
innocent?

23:29.366 --> 23:30.600
Erica:
Yes, I am.

23:30.600 --> 23:32.766
Malcolm: Oh, that's great.
That's really great.

23:33.700 --> 23:35.533
Erica:
What did I do to you?

23:35.533 --> 23:37.133
Malcolm: Nothing,
you're perfect.

23:37.133 --> 23:38.333
That's great.
You know what?

23:38.333 --> 23:40.533
I can't believe
I was ever friends with you.

23:40.533 --> 23:43.133
Oh, well, there's something
we can at least agree on.

23:43.133 --> 23:44.633
(water laps gently)

23:46.666 --> 23:48.533
Where is
everybody?

23:48.533 --> 23:50.500
"Little Joe."

23:50.500 --> 23:52.333
Little Joe?
It's supposed to be "Smoke."

23:52.333 --> 23:54.700
We're at
the wrong lake.

23:54.700 --> 23:55.433
Shit!

23:58.466 --> 23:59.700
Malcolm:
This is so retarded.

23:59.700 --> 24:01.533
Look, we missed
the sign, all right?

24:01.533 --> 24:03.533
We double back
and we find the path.

24:03.533 --> 24:05.100
Don't be worried.

24:05.100 --> 24:06.700
Hey,
I'm not worried!

24:14.700 --> 24:15.700
Erica:
Ouch.

24:18.433 --> 24:20.233
Malcom:
(panting)

24:20.233 --> 24:21.300
Malcom: Big Joe lake.

24:21.300 --> 24:22.233
Erica: What?!

24:22.233 --> 24:24.366
Damn it.

24:24.366 --> 24:27.733
I can't carry
this pack anymore.

24:27.733 --> 24:28.733
(grunts)

24:33.333 --> 24:35.733
You know, if we--
If we just wait it out,

24:35.733 --> 24:37.333
they're gonna realize
that we're lost

24:37.333 --> 24:40.300
and they'll send
a tripper to find us.

24:40.300 --> 24:41.300
You want?

24:44.033 --> 24:45.166
(bag crinkles)

24:47.333 --> 24:49.066
(tent poles clatter)

24:49.666 --> 24:50.733
What're you doing?

24:50.733 --> 24:52.333
Well, it's getting
dark out soon

24:52.333 --> 24:54.233
and if they
don't find us,

24:54.233 --> 24:56.333
we may have
to spend the night.

24:56.333 --> 24:59.333
So, I'm gonna
set up the tent.

25:01.533 --> 25:02.733
Well,
you're doing it wrong.

25:02.733 --> 25:04.433
Well, then help me!

25:04.433 --> 25:07.600
Just gimme this.
Gimme this.

25:08.600 --> 25:09.600
Can I do something?

25:09.600 --> 25:11.333
Just go look
for firewood.

25:15.333 --> 25:17.133
Wait a second,
I'll come with you.

25:17.133 --> 25:18.533
No, it's okay,
I got it.

25:18.533 --> 25:20.166
No, you shouldn't go
by yourself.

25:20.166 --> 25:21.333
Just wait for me!

25:24.100 --> 25:26.133
What're you afraid of?
I'm gonna whack myself

25:26.133 --> 25:27.566
in the face
with a branch?

25:27.566 --> 25:29.366
Malcolm: There are bears
in the woods.

25:29.366 --> 25:30.600
Erica:
Oh ho ho ho.

25:30.600 --> 25:32.700
And if we meet one,
you're gonna what?

25:32.700 --> 25:33.700
Fight it off me?

25:33.700 --> 25:34.700
If I have to.

25:34.700 --> 25:36.066
Oh, that's noble.

25:36.066 --> 25:37.333
Especially considering
you spent the last week

25:37.333 --> 25:38.733
trying to
get rid of me.

25:38.733 --> 25:40.733
Yeah, get rid of you,
not kill you.

25:40.733 --> 25:41.733
(rustling from
the bushes)

25:41.733 --> 25:42.433
What was that?

25:42.433 --> 25:43.133
Very funny.

25:43.133 --> 25:44.766
Shhh.

25:44.766 --> 25:46.133
It's a raccoon.

25:46.133 --> 25:48.766
(leaves rustle,
twigs crack)

25:48.766 --> 25:50.300
No, that's
not a raccoon,

25:50.300 --> 25:54.133
that's bigger
than a raccoon.

25:54.133 --> 25:55.466
(leaves rustle, branches snap,
animal bellows)

25:55.466 --> 25:58.300
Oh my god,
it's a bear.

25:58.300 --> 25:59.033
(scoffs)

25:59.033 --> 26:00.300
It's not a bear.

26:00.300 --> 26:02.766
(frightened breaths)

26:02.766 --> 26:04.666
(animal bellows,
branch cracks)

26:04.666 --> 26:06.266
Oh my god!
Run, run!

26:10.500 --> 26:12.666
Shhh, shhh.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.100
Oh my god!

26:15.600 --> 26:17.300
Oh my god,
it's following us.

26:18.700 --> 26:20.633
(frantic panting)

26:20.633 --> 26:23.066
(leaves rustle,
Erica yelps)

26:23.400 --> 26:24.666
(low grunt)

26:24.666 --> 26:27.500
Oh god.

26:27.500 --> 26:29.033
Hi, Bambi.

26:29.033 --> 26:30.500
(gasping for breath,
relieved)

26:30.500 --> 26:32.000
Erica: I'm
such an idiot.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.300
Malcolm: You
always do this.

26:33.300 --> 26:34.500
You remember the bat?

26:34.500 --> 26:36.733
Yup. I broke the cabin door
because of that bat.

26:36.733 --> 26:39.566
Malcolm: Yeah, or the tree frog?
You were running so fast,

26:39.566 --> 26:40.766
you tripped on a root.

26:40.766 --> 26:42.366
It was
a very scary frog.

26:42.366 --> 26:45.000
It was a fast hopper
and it was chasing me.

26:50.400 --> 26:53.733
If I'd been there,
I would've protected you.

26:53.733 --> 26:55.066
I know.

26:56.066 --> 26:58.533
You always did take me
seriously.

26:58.533 --> 27:01.600
You know, even when
I get all crazy.

27:03.766 --> 27:06.333
(relieved exhales)

27:06.333 --> 27:07.333
(laughing)

27:11.066 --> 27:12.066
Oh.

27:15.333 --> 27:17.000
I don't get it,
Malcolm?

27:17.000 --> 27:19.233
How do we go from
spending every day together

27:19.233 --> 27:21.366
to hating each other?

27:22.366 --> 27:24.266
Yeah, that sucks.

27:24.266 --> 27:25.766
It really does.

27:26.266 --> 27:28.100
And right now,
I'm looking at you

27:28.100 --> 27:31.766
and I'm thinking,
"hey, there he is.

27:31.766 --> 27:35.400
There's the guy that used to be
my best friend."

27:35.400 --> 27:37.600
I really
miss that guy.

27:38.600 --> 27:40.200
(exhales shakily)

27:40.200 --> 27:42.400
I just wanna know
why it all fell apart?

27:48.133 --> 27:51.400
Don't you think
we should talk about it?

27:51.400 --> 27:52.400
Yeah, we could,

27:52.400 --> 27:54.300
except I'm so thirsty
right now,

27:54.300 --> 27:56.633
you know,
I can barely form sentences.

27:56.633 --> 27:58.400
'Kay, well,

27:58.400 --> 28:00.666
Why don't I get us
some delicious,

28:00.666 --> 28:03.466
algae-flavoured
lake water.

28:10.466 --> 28:12.266
(inhales and exhales)

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
Ugh!

28:22.133 --> 28:25.366
Well, if you like warm,
fish-flavored water,

28:25.366 --> 28:27.400
you will love this.

28:31.700 --> 28:34.033
Oh, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

28:34.033 --> 28:37.133
Don't talk.
Let's just start over.

28:37.133 --> 28:40.033
I wasn't ready,
now I am.

28:40.033 --> 28:41.066
I wanna do this.

28:41.066 --> 28:42.333
Okay,
but what about Rachel?

28:42.333 --> 28:45.200
I don't want
Rachel, I want you.

28:45.200 --> 28:47.200
(exhales uneasily)

28:48.233 --> 28:49.766
Uh, Malcolm.

28:51.466 --> 28:53.500
Uh, uh.
Malcolm.

28:53.500 --> 28:54.700
I thought
you wanted this?

28:54.700 --> 28:56.500
Ah, no, I just
I wanna talk.

28:56.500 --> 28:58.200
Forget talking.

28:58.200 --> 29:00.300
(uncomfortable grunt)

29:00.300 --> 29:03.100
But your hands
are shaking?

29:05.500 --> 29:07.100
(struggling grunts)

29:07.100 --> 29:08.133
(stifled shouts
of protest)

29:08.133 --> 29:10.666
Get off of me!

29:10.666 --> 29:13.000
Oh my god,
I'm so sorry.

29:13.000 --> 29:13.633
Oh my god.

29:13.633 --> 29:14.633
You're sorry?!

29:14.633 --> 29:16.200
Uh--

29:16.200 --> 29:18.166
I don't, uh,
Heh--

29:18.166 --> 29:19.700
I-I can't.

29:19.700 --> 29:21.733
Erica: You can't, you can't,
You can't what?

29:21.733 --> 29:23.733
One minute you're
my friend and then you--

29:23.733 --> 29:25.300
Become this monster.

29:25.300 --> 29:26.466
I know.

29:26.466 --> 29:28.566
It's like you can't decide
whether you like me,

29:28.566 --> 29:31.533
or whether
I repulse you.

29:31.533 --> 29:34.433
Do you have any
idea what that's like?

29:34.433 --> 29:37.433
To feel like
you're disgusting?

29:37.666 --> 29:39.666
God, that is why
I tried to pretend

29:39.666 --> 29:40.700
like you didn't exist.

29:40.700 --> 29:43.633
That was why I tried
to destroy you

29:43.633 --> 29:47.033
because I was--
I was so, so hurt.

29:47.033 --> 29:49.666
(breathing hard,
welling up)

29:49.666 --> 29:51.300
Malcolm?!

29:51.300 --> 29:52.300
It's not you.

29:52.300 --> 29:53.633
There's nothing
wrong with you.

29:53.633 --> 29:56.033
It's me.

29:57.033 --> 29:58.433
I just--

29:58.433 --> 29:59.466
What?

29:59.466 --> 30:01.466
(breathing hard)

30:05.233 --> 30:06.233
I'm gay.

30:07.233 --> 30:08.233
(panicky breaths)

30:11.433 --> 30:12.433
Oh.

30:13.233 --> 30:15.266
If you tell anybody,
I swear to god--

30:15.266 --> 30:18.066
No, I would never.
Ah--

30:18.766 --> 30:20.400
You must think
I'm a freak.

30:20.400 --> 30:22.200
No. not at all.

30:24.300 --> 30:26.466
I wish that you
would've told me before

30:26.466 --> 30:29.533
and then none of this
would've happened.

30:29.533 --> 30:31.333
I mean,
why didn't you tell me?

30:31.333 --> 30:32.600
Why didn't I tell you?

30:32.600 --> 30:34.233
Why didn't I walk
around naked?

30:34.233 --> 30:37.066
Why didn't I tell you
the one thing you could use

30:37.066 --> 30:39.600
to wreck
my whole life?

30:39.600 --> 30:42.533
It's a really stupid
question, I'm sorry.

30:42.533 --> 30:44.233
(exhales)

30:44.233 --> 30:46.766
Oh god,
just it all makes sense.

30:48.400 --> 30:50.100
Finally,
oh my god.

30:53.033 --> 30:54.433
Malcolm.

30:54.433 --> 30:58.266
I-I can only imagine how hard
that was for you to tell me.

30:58.266 --> 30:59.400
But please, trust me,

30:59.400 --> 31:02.233
I am the last person
that would betray you

31:02.233 --> 31:03.700
or judge you.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.266
I mean, my Uncle Ruby,
he's gay.

31:09.366 --> 31:11.500
I kissed
a girl once.

31:11.500 --> 31:13.266
I did.

31:13.266 --> 31:15.233
And it
was good, too.

31:17.233 --> 31:19.233
And you know
who else is gay?

31:19.233 --> 31:20.633
Brandon,
that guy from your cabin.

31:20.633 --> 31:22.233
Brandon is not gay.

31:22.233 --> 31:24.266
Maybe not now,
but give him ten years.

31:24.266 --> 31:27.166
I can't believe
I'm talking to you about this.

31:27.166 --> 31:34.300
Hey, it's better than not
talking about it, believe me.

31:34.300 --> 31:35.533
(exhales)

31:38.066 --> 31:40.033
You know,
you should go for Brandon.

31:40.033 --> 31:41.366
Erica.

31:41.366 --> 31:43.533
What?
He's totally hot.

31:44.533 --> 31:46.200
Sorry,
is it too much?

31:46.200 --> 31:47.200
Yeah.

31:49.500 --> 31:54.533
Look, a canoe.

31:54.533 --> 31:56.266
Hey, you guys!

31:57.600 --> 31:59.166
You guys!

31:59.166 --> 32:00.333
We're over here!

32:01.600 --> 32:03.733
You guys are retarded!
Can't you read the signs?

32:03.733 --> 32:05.533
The whole camp's
looking for you.

32:05.533 --> 32:07.400
Sorry,
we just, uh--

32:08.433 --> 32:10.133
We got
a little distracted.

32:11.533 --> 32:14.066
Sari:
Are you guys back together?

32:14.066 --> 32:16.133
You could say that.

32:19.566 --> 32:21.733
Yeah,
we're all good.

32:22.733 --> 32:24.666
Come on,
let's go.

32:24.666 --> 32:26.166
(exhales happily)

32:28.733 --> 32:29.733
Ungh!

32:41.733 --> 32:44.066
Was that
really necessary?

32:47.200 --> 32:49.233
Beautiful night
for a walk.

32:49.233 --> 32:51.033
I need to go talk
to Ethan.

32:51.033 --> 32:52.266
Oh, talk to Ethan.

32:52.266 --> 32:54.200
Now, there's
a novel idea.

32:54.200 --> 32:56.400
It's unbelievable,
my friendship with Malcolm,

32:56.400 --> 32:58.233
it ended
because we just--

32:58.233 --> 33:01.200
We never talked
about what was going on.

33:01.433 --> 33:04.233
And the thing that kills me
is that it's so simple,

33:04.233 --> 33:07.233
why didn't I just ask Malcolm
what was going on with him?

33:07.233 --> 33:11.633
Why did I let it escalate
into this full on war?

33:11.633 --> 33:12.633
Because.

33:14.233 --> 33:15.466
Do you
know that talking

33:15.466 --> 33:17.266
as a means
of resolving conflict

33:17.266 --> 33:19.400
actually goes against
every biological instinct

33:19.400 --> 33:20.500
that we have?

33:20.500 --> 33:22.500
You know,
we feel threatened

33:22.500 --> 33:23.633
and so we fight.

33:23.633 --> 33:26.000
Or if you don't have
the stomach for that,

33:26.000 --> 33:26.766
we run.

33:26.766 --> 33:28.233
Like Ethan.

33:28.233 --> 33:30.666
Yeah, Ethan ran,
Malcolm attacked.

33:30.666 --> 33:32.033
Well, different strokes.

33:32.033 --> 33:33.266
But Malcolm
was different though

33:33.266 --> 33:34.533
'cause he
had a secret.

33:34.533 --> 33:37.566
What, you think
he's the only one?

33:38.466 --> 33:39.500
What does that mean?

33:39.500 --> 33:41.500
You know, Erica,
sometimes we fight

33:41.500 --> 33:44.200
simply because we're unable
to tell the other person

33:44.200 --> 33:45.633
how we really feel.

33:45.633 --> 33:47.500
What, are you
talking about me?

33:47.500 --> 33:50.266
Because I have always been
completely honest with Ethan.

33:50.266 --> 33:51.466
Mm-hm.

33:51.466 --> 33:54.266
You're sure about that?

33:55.033 --> 33:58.033
Well, good.
As long as you're sure.

33:58.033 --> 33:59.333
Good night.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.633
Oh, I'm exhausted.

34:12.666 --> 34:16.066
It's funny,
I'm not tired at all.

34:16.066 --> 34:19.199
Could be because
I'm ovulating.

34:19.199 --> 34:20.166
(snort of laughter)

34:20.166 --> 34:22.100
and is that supposed
to turn me on?

34:22.100 --> 34:25.166
I'm just saying,
if you want--

34:26.500 --> 34:28.199
What I want--

34:28.199 --> 34:30.500
is to give, uh,
give you your--

34:30.500 --> 34:32.266
Your birthday present.

34:32.266 --> 34:33.333
Huh?

34:33.333 --> 34:35.300
What is this?

34:35.300 --> 34:36.433
(laughing)

34:37.766 --> 34:39.400
Oh my god,
tickets to London?

34:39.400 --> 34:40.466
We're going to London?!

34:40.466 --> 34:41.766
We are.
We are.

34:41.766 --> 34:44.366
I got some news,
I got some big news.

34:44.366 --> 34:47.266
They wanna
make me senior vp

34:47.266 --> 34:49.199
at the UK office.

34:52.533 --> 34:54.400
I'm sorry,
You wanna move there?

34:55.400 --> 34:58.533
Babe, this is a huge
opportunity.

34:58.533 --> 35:01.266
I thought
you'd be happy.

35:01.266 --> 35:03.066
(exhales, unsure)

35:03.066 --> 35:05.366
I am, but uh,
London's really far.

35:05.366 --> 35:07.566
I mean, what about the house?
And my job?

35:07.566 --> 35:10.633
Josh: We'll sell the house.
You wanted a bigger one anyway.

35:10.633 --> 35:15.100
You'll get a staff job
at some, uh, London hospital.

35:20.666 --> 35:22.133
It's a big promotion.

35:22.133 --> 35:24.566
Pffft!
It's gigantic.

35:25.566 --> 35:27.333
London.

Hi.

37:48.333 --> 37:49.400
How are you?

37:50.400 --> 37:51.400
Bad.

37:54.766 --> 37:55.633
(exhales)

37:55.633 --> 37:57.500
I'm worried,

37:57.500 --> 37:58.500
Upset.

37:59.633 --> 38:01.300
Just--

38:01.300 --> 38:03.000
I feel like--

38:03.233 --> 38:04.666
I don't know what
you're thinking

38:04.666 --> 38:07.300
or where
your heads at.

38:07.300 --> 38:09.733
Yeah, I'm trying
to figure that out myself.

38:09.733 --> 38:12.166
It feels like we keep
having the same fight

38:12.166 --> 38:15.566
but don't
talk about it, and--

38:15.566 --> 38:17.500
I don't know
what's going on.

38:17.500 --> 38:20.433
Okay, I-I,
I feel trapped.

38:23.600 --> 38:24.500
(inhales deeply)

38:24.500 --> 38:26.200
Okay.

38:26.200 --> 38:27.633
I-I mean
the toiletry bag,

38:27.633 --> 38:30.000
all the talk of me
sleeping over,

38:30.000 --> 38:30.733
your family,

38:30.733 --> 38:32.000
it's like
all this pressure

38:32.000 --> 38:34.366
all these expectations
that I don't want;

38:34.366 --> 38:35.600
that I'm not ready for.

38:35.600 --> 38:38.466
You, you keep
pushing me.

38:38.466 --> 38:40.466
Look, we've only been
together a few weeks

38:40.466 --> 38:43.133
and-and
you're acting like--

38:43.133 --> 38:45.233
I'm ready
to get married?

38:46.233 --> 38:47.233
Yeah.

38:51.033 --> 38:51.766
What's that about?

38:51.766 --> 38:52.766
Ugh--

38:54.200 --> 38:55.266
I don't know.

38:55.266 --> 38:56.233
Hey.

38:58.200 --> 39:01.433
Well, that's not true,
I do know,

39:02.233 --> 39:04.666
but I don't
wanna tell you.

39:04.666 --> 39:06.133
Okay, why?

39:07.133 --> 39:08.766
Because--

39:08.766 --> 39:09.766
(exhales)

39:13.766 --> 39:16.300
Wow,
this is really hard.

39:17.300 --> 39:19.400
Because I feel--

39:19.400 --> 39:23.700
Like if this doesn't
work out with you,

39:23.700 --> 39:26.400
I really am never
gonna find anyone.

39:26.400 --> 39:27.500
Erica.

39:27.500 --> 39:29.666
And I have been waiting
a really long time

39:29.666 --> 39:31.266
to meet
the right person.

39:33.400 --> 39:34.633
And sometimes
I'm worried

39:34.633 --> 39:37.166
that the reason
it's taken me so long

39:37.166 --> 39:38.766
is 'cause there's
something wrong with me.

39:38.766 --> 39:40.166
Hey, hey.

39:40.166 --> 39:42.466
There is nothing
wrong with you.

39:42.466 --> 39:46.133
I love you
and I wanna be with you.

39:47.700 --> 39:48.700
But--

39:50.566 --> 39:54.033
I don't know
if I wanna marry you.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.333
(pained gasp)

40:01.333 --> 40:02.666
It's too soon.

40:05.666 --> 40:06.666
(sighs)

40:09.000 --> 40:12.333
No, that's okay,
keep going.

40:13.266 --> 40:14.266
Just--

40:17.133 --> 40:21.400
I just, I need to take
things more slowly.

40:22.566 --> 40:24.300
Okay.

40:24.300 --> 40:26.100
I know,
I mean it makes sense.

40:26.100 --> 40:28.700
It's just this
whole thing is--

40:28.700 --> 40:32.433
It's irrational
and stupid insecurity and--

40:33.433 --> 40:36.400
And when you get
freaked out, you clam up.

40:36.400 --> 40:37.700
I know.

40:37.700 --> 40:39.533
And then
I get paranoid,

40:39.533 --> 40:42.033
and that makes me
act even crazier.

40:42.033 --> 40:43.766
(exhales heavily)

40:46.033 --> 40:47.033
Wow.

40:48.566 --> 40:52.100
I get it now.

40:52.100 --> 40:53.100
What?

40:54.066 --> 40:57.100
Why people don't talk
to each other.

40:57.100 --> 40:59.433
This is
really intense.

41:02.066 --> 41:03.766
Hey.

41:03.766 --> 41:05.233
Come here.

41:10.233 --> 41:12.466
Erica:
Conflict.

41:12.466 --> 41:13.633
It's everywhere
you look.

41:13.633 --> 41:15.366
It touches
everything we do,

41:15.366 --> 41:18.233
every relationship
we have.

41:18.233 --> 41:20.366
Isn't it funny,
how at their core,

41:20.366 --> 41:21.766
all fights
are the same?

41:21.766 --> 41:23.666
Two people yelling
or accusing

41:23.666 --> 41:25.300
or running away,

41:25.300 --> 41:28.100
two people doing anything
to avoid telling each other

41:28.100 --> 41:30.366
what they really feel.

41:31.500 --> 41:34.400
Just talk
when you wanna run,

41:35.400 --> 41:36.766
reveal when
you wanna attack.

41:36.766 --> 41:39.333
It's so simple.

41:39.333 --> 41:41.166
So obvious.

41:41.166 --> 41:45.233
And at the same time,
so incredibly hard.

41:45.233 --> 41:46.266
(door closes)

41:47.633 --> 41:49.100
(traffic hums)

41:50.133 --> 41:52.033
(clears throat)

41:52.033 --> 41:53.033
Good morning.

41:55.266 --> 41:56.266
Yeah.

41:58.633 --> 42:00.633
(gate clanks
and squeaks open)

42:00.633 --> 42:02.033
(to self)
Okay.

42:07.600 --> 42:09.133
Kai,

42:09.133 --> 42:10.533
I'm gonna to tell you
something

42:10.533 --> 42:12.533
and I know that
it's gonna sound crazy.

42:12.533 --> 42:14.300
Just--

42:14.300 --> 42:15.300
I know, okay?

42:15.300 --> 42:17.266
I know what
you're gonna tell me.

42:17.266 --> 42:18.300
You do?

42:18.300 --> 42:19.433
Yeah.

42:19.433 --> 42:21.400
Some guy came up to me
on the street one day,

42:21.400 --> 42:23.233
told me he
could fix my life,

42:23.233 --> 42:26.633
all he needed
was a commitment.

42:26.633 --> 42:28.700
I can't believe this.

42:28.700 --> 42:30.566
Does...

42:30.566 --> 42:33.300
Does he send you
back in time?

42:33.300 --> 42:34.433
Yeah.

42:34.433 --> 42:35.700
Oh my god!

42:35.700 --> 42:36.733
What are
the chances?

42:36.733 --> 42:38.700
Because I saw you go
through that door

42:38.700 --> 42:40.700
and I knew that
what I was seeing,

42:40.700 --> 42:42.633
it could
only mean that--

42:42.633 --> 42:43.433
What's your name?

42:43.433 --> 42:44.533
I'm sorry, remind me.

42:44.533 --> 42:45.333
Oh, it's Erica.

42:45.333 --> 42:46.333
Erica?

42:46.333 --> 42:47.733
I'm just, I'm so happy
to finally meet someone

42:47.733 --> 42:49.333
who's going through the
same thing.

42:49.333 --> 42:52.400
You know, someone to just
talk about this all with,

42:52.400 --> 42:54.300
another person
that has been there.

42:54.300 --> 42:55.200
Erica.

42:55.200 --> 42:56.633
Don't take this
the wrong way,

42:56.633 --> 42:58.333
but that's
not gonna be me.

42:58.333 --> 42:59.466
What?

42:59.466 --> 43:01.033
I don't wanna talk to you
about time travel,

43:01.033 --> 43:02.666
or therapy,
or any of it.

43:02.666 --> 43:05.433
I'm happy to chat
about vanilla syrup.

43:05.433 --> 43:07.166
Or uh TV shows,
or religion,

43:07.166 --> 43:08.433
or politics.
You name it.

43:08.433 --> 43:09.733
Wha--
I don't understand.

43:09.733 --> 43:12.166
I know, and you're not
going to understand,

43:12.166 --> 43:16.633
but I wanted to stop you
before you got too excited.

43:16.633 --> 43:17.766
See you around.

43:17.766 --> 43:18.766
Uh, no.

43:20.066 --> 43:22.033
Kai?

43:22.033 --> 43:23.600
It's nothing personal.

43:23.600 --> 43:24.600
Really.

43:29.166 --> 43:30.700
(cafe door closes)
