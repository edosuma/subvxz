<u> <i> THE TRENCH
 &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ u&gt;</i>

00:57.437 --> 01:00.475
In the summer of 1916, the British Army
in northern France, was preparing to...

01:00.858 --> 01:05.896
... most offensive
WWI.

01:07.365 --> 01:10.948
As hundreds of thousands of soldiers in
the rear awaiting the order to attack, ...

01:10.948 --> 01:15.896
. . a number of smaller force occupied
place in the front line trenches

02:27.826 --> 02:29.409
June 29, 1916

02:34.111 --> 02:37.342
Somme Valley

02:38.999 --> 02:40.258
Two red jacks and a lady in red.
Double Pay

02:44.040 --> 02:48.397
I want to see them. . Queen and spades
- I cover... it's me again

02:48.397 --> 02:51.199
Billy, you have some water
wonderful for us?

02:51.199 --> 02:53.954
Nice and clean, is not it?

02:53.954 --> 02:56.429
It's the best
can get. ?

03:00.440 --> 03:03.273
Do you have any news?
- Have you seen my brother?

03:03.273 --> 03:04.953
In Park Lane.

03:08.640 --> 03:10.119
Do you have any sugar?.

03:17.080 --> 03:20.868
With greetings Sergeant
- Good job, Billy.

03:28.640 --> 03:30.870
So When did it begin?

03:30.870 --> 03:35.113
I have no idea
They look like sardines in the reserve trenches

03:35.113 --> 03:37.271
But do not say nothing.

03:38.120 --> 03:42.750
It's something I've never seen.
Men and women...

03:42.750 --> 03:46.151
That's right...
- Now that's a kick, yes. .

03:46.151 --> 03:49.596
Dirty Liar!
- I tell you!

03:49.596 --> 03:54.231
They did actually. You could see everything. ?

03:54.231 --> 03:57.915
And that was sold to
- Ten pounds per photo.

03:57.915 --> 04:02.596
So a man and a woman were
to do so and were photographed...

04:02.596 --> 04:05.228
It bestial... ...
- Nobody does. Liar.

04:05.228 --> 04:08.870
And if someone gives you 100 pounds
a whore to do?

04:09.720 --> 04:11.392
See?

04:14.600 --> 04:19.390
Then I have to cover my face
-Entomces pay it easily. .

04:19.390 --> 04:21.676
Callensen damn!

04:22.600 --> 04:25.797
Good morning, Sergeant
- Take care, Dennis. .

04:32.680 --> 04:34.796
Hi, guys.
Sergeant...

04:42.720 --> 04:48.955
Did you get Entoces buy?
- No, they were too expensive, but...

04:48.955 --> 04:51.554
... I have some
- Mostralas!

04:51.554 --> 04:53.756
Yes Teach them, liar.

04:53.756 --> 04:56.480
But you have to pay for it
a penny.

04:57.440 --> 05:01.228
And I want the money before
-. We will, Billy.

05:04.880 --> 05:07.519
If no value,
I want my money back.

05:08.640 --> 05:10.631
Let's see them

05:13.320 --> 05:15.470
Carefully!

05:16.880 --> 05:19.110
Go passing them

05:20.200 --> 05:24.910
This is beautiful
-Pasamelas Macfarlane

05:33.240 --> 05:36.437
Eddie, look at this

05:39.280 --> 05:43.353
It looks exactly the same to that...
- Very nice to be a whore?.

05:43.353 --> 05:47.752
No, who looks
pensalo?

05:47.752 --> 05:51.071
If supieraz who is?...
- That girl. !!

05:51.071 --> 05:54.277
That girl in the post office
What do you think?

05:54.277 --> 05:58.797
I swear
No, it probably is

05:58.797 --> 06:01.269
It looks like her.

06:01.269 --> 06:03.317
What was he doing?
- No idea

06:03.317 --> 06:05.710
Time passed, honey.

06:06.960 --> 06:09.269
Comes an officer!
- Keep them. .

06:12.800 --> 06:14.438
At rest.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.870
Can I talk to you, Sergeant?

06:38.640 --> 06:40.551
It has been postponed.

06:40.551 --> 06:44.349
For a day or two
And we have to stay here.

06:44.349 --> 06:45.149
Here?
Oh Jesus Christ!

06:50.000 --> 06:52.116
And the rest of the battalion?
- Backup?

06:52.116 --> 06:55.397
They will come tonight and need to keep the line
until they arrive. .

06:55.397 --> 07:00.156
That will be just before the attack
- Other two nights?

07:00.156 --> 07:04.950
But we will be with the first wave
We are the third wave.

07:04.950 --> 07:09.193
But that's not what they said...
- I told them that we wanted

07:09.193 --> 07:11.351
Very emphatically.

07:11.351 --> 07:16.071
But they say that we are well
provided hot food and stuff.

07:16.920 --> 07:21.311
What do you think?
- The third wave, said. / / - If

07:21.311 --> 07:23.471
Supplies will come

07:24.480 --> 07:26.038
Well
Well...

07:33.080 --> 07:35.594
Fix this mess
- What mess, Sergeant?

07:37.480 --> 07:39.391
That fucking mess!

07:58.120 --> 07:59.872
What measuring tools...

08:03.360 --> 08:08.718
I'm sick of digging in this way
- What the fuck is wrong with you animals'

08:08.718 --> 08:11.838
Always doing shit hole
What war!

08:11.838 --> 08:14.036
A side. Free way!

08:14.036 --> 08:17.192
Care back there... . Out of the way.

08:19.880 --> 08:21.518
Engineers.

08:21.518 --> 08:24.399
Give me a hand.
The guys are the experts. .

08:24.399 --> 08:28.519
They are good men, but
- The salt of the earth.

08:31.600 --> 08:33.669
They seemed very happy

08:39.240 --> 08:41.674
Macfarlane and Daventry, your turn.

08:57.080 --> 08:58.991
Move it

08:58.991 --> 09:02.197
Fuck them. Go to sleep
-. Thank you, Sergeant.

09:03.760 --> 09:06.752
One up, one down. Alternatively.

09:44.560 --> 09:47.358
Thank you very much.

09:47.358 --> 09:50.751
So bad it is, Lieutenant.

09:50.751 --> 09:54.390
Anyway nice

09:54.390 --> 09:58.473
I would like a sandwich
No matter what, except... .

09:58.473 --> 10:01.871
Canned meat
- I seek, Lieutenant.

10:01.871 --> 10:05.635
I think there is Sardines.
Thank you!

10:56.480 --> 11:00.758
Macfarlane, keep your head down.

11:07.000 --> 11:07.960
Listen.

11:11.240 --> 11:14.391
Do not smoke, do not sleep

11:15.760 --> 11:18.035
Sergeant?

11:20.520 --> 11:23.398
How far they are from us
because I see nothing?.

11:23.398 --> 11:25.869
Approximately 400 yards

11:25.869 --> 11:28.759
But keep your eyes open

11:28.759 --> 11:31.434
Last night, shot nine times

11:31.434 --> 11:35.070
Fired?
- Snipers.

11:35.070 --> 11:38.630
Why do you think the trenches
are so deep?

11:38.630 --> 11:45.035
There is a sniper gun pointing to the peephole
If you see a move, shoot

11:45.035 --> 11:49.318
Therefore it is very important...
So do not do anything stupid. .

11:49.737 --> 11:50.396
Okay Sergeant

11:50.640 --> 11:54.553
Links are the Scots who
are right on our right

11:54.553 --> 11:57.234
That's all you need to know.

11:57.234 --> 11:58.913
Sergeant?

11:59.840 --> 12:02.434
When... when expected
the attack?

12:03.880 --> 12:06.269
I'll let you know with
advance.

12:10.640 --> 12:12.551
Billy... carefully

12:54.800 --> 12:56.756
Daventry!

12:59.240 --> 13:02.277
Daventry!
- Yes

13:06.240 --> 13:08.356
How are you?

13:10.720 --> 13:13.439
I can not be better.

13:13.439 --> 13:16.831
I would not be anywhere else.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.989
And you, how are you?

13:22.989 --> 13:25.435
Want to relieve you?

13:27.280 --> 13:29.999
I have to pee
- So. ?

13:29.999 --> 13:32.799
What's the problem?.

13:32.799 --> 13:37.636
I do not know where to do it
- In the trench, no one will notice.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.594
I promise I will not tell

13:43.440 --> 13:48.195
All right.
I will in a moment.

13:49.080 --> 13:51.071
Very noble of you

13:56.720 --> 13:59.518
How long have
Tommy was killed?.

14:01.280 --> 14:06.274
Since December 1914
- Yes, now I remember.

14:07.080 --> 14:10.117
God, it's been almost two years.

14:10.117 --> 14:12.555
It was ten days before Christmas.

14:14.400 --> 14:15.958
How... ?

14:17.800 --> 14:20.473
How was he really dead?

14:22.080 --> 14:24.275
I have curiosity.

14:25.800 --> 14:28.075
It was by an artillery shell

14:28.075 --> 14:30.390
It exploded on top of it.

14:32.280 --> 14:35.670
I went to see their companions.

14:35.670 --> 14:38.877
I talked to them after
and was told that Tom...

14:38.877 --> 14:42.953
... Completely disappeared
He was gone.

14:42.953 --> 14:44.917
Completely

14:46.160 --> 14:49.869
Well, almost completely...

14:49.869 --> 14:54.079
All they found
all small remnants...

14:54.079 --> 14:57.869
They gathered in a sock
- Damn!

14:59.280 --> 15:02.795
Why do you think so many Germans killed
as I can?

15:02.795 --> 15:08.034
When we attack kill
all that we can... By Tom.

15:11.480 --> 15:14.870
zEnterraron the sock?
- What sock?.

15:14.870 --> 15:20.672
This sock where all the rest of it?
- Do not know. Why do. ?

15:20.672 --> 15:25.118
In a normal burial?
- Do not know. Why?

15:26.240 --> 15:28.629
So worth the effort.

15:40.922 --> 15:42.880
Daventry?
Daventry!

15:46.040 --> 15:48.952
What is it?
- I heard something...

15:56.200 --> 16:00.910
Probably one of us
- I heard German voices.

16:04.840 --> 16:08.628
Billy. You hear those explosions?

16:08.628 --> 16:13.237
Do not be stupid
- That bombing runs for five days. .

16:13.237 --> 16:17.712
Thousands and thousands of shells fall
in the German trenches / / z Then?

16:17.712 --> 16:21.316
So if you're a German...

16:21.316 --> 16:26.759
... with all those explosions, z'd
walking in no man's land?

16:34.520 --> 16:36.988
Not
... . Probably not.

16:47.200 --> 16:49.839
Go to sleep, Macfarlane.

16:49.839 --> 16:52.753
At six hours we will be ready.

16:52.753 --> 16:57.596
Nothing to report, Sergeant
He is calm.

16:57.596 --> 16:59.910
See you later, Daventry.

16:59.910 --> 17:02.310
Yes, see you later.

17:04.920 --> 17:06.797
How are you?

17:58.920 --> 18:01.957
Here you go,

18:01.957 --> 18:02.797
Thanks

18:08.560 --> 18:11.597
Well Anything new?
- All quiet.

18:13.880 --> 18:16.599
Most sleep

18:28.840 --> 18:32.879
Want a drink
against cold Sergeant?

18:36.640 --> 18:40.155
I am a teetotaler, I promised.

18:42.600 --> 18:46.559
This is beautiful. Very good.
Admirable.

18:46.559 --> 18:50.235
I do not understand how you can, Sgt.

18:50.235 --> 18:54.916
Do not condemn anyone. Do not judge others
who drink...

18:54.916 --> 18:58.993
... Just not for me.

18:58.993 --> 19:03.756
I like to take something from time to time
In the early morning hours. .

19:03.756 --> 19:07.515
Prevents me crazy
- What is good... .

19:11.280 --> 19:13.874
What is good for one... .

19:13.874 --> 19:17.476
... is another man's poison
- Yes

19:17.476 --> 19:19.756
Of course.

19:19.756 --> 19:22.593
Well, I go to sleep
You... ?

19:22.593 --> 19:26.230
I'll do a round
And then go to the reserve trench. .

19:26.230 --> 19:31.428
Tomorrow will be a long day, we must
keep them busy. . Do not let them inactive.

19:32.480 --> 19:35.995
I'll see that this is
- Well, good night.

20:36.000 --> 20:40.790
Eddie, what time is it?
- Too late for me to wake up

20:41.363 --> 20:42.043
Sorry

20:44.360 --> 20:46.237
ZESA girl?

20:47.800 --> 20:51.076
The post office.

20:51.076 --> 20:53.754
Have you ever talked to her?

20:53.754 --> 20:56.434
Sometimes
Billy, I'm exhausted.

20:59.600 --> 21:01.955
How old was he?

21:01.955 --> 21:05.032
I do not know...
nineteen or twenty years. .

21:06.120 --> 21:09.715
It's bigger than us...
- Think do with it?

21:09.715 --> 21:12.678
Did she do not mean
not married?

21:12.678 --> 21:14.671
Good night.

21:21.080 --> 21:24.072
Where did they come from?
- Damn it. Liverpool was.

21:24.072 --> 21:28.028
Liverpool was Irish
It's all I know. . I kept making you the idea

21:28.028 --> 21:30.919
Liverpool Irish girl?

21:37.440 --> 21:39.476
Nearly 19 years...

21:43.720 --> 21:45.358
Billy.

21:46.200 --> 21:48.395
Do not you...

21:48.395 --> 21:51.028
Do you worry about being killed

21:52.560 --> 21:53.280
Course

21:54.840 --> 21:56.273
Duermete

21:57.760 --> 22:00.797
Because I think you could
have saved

22:02.560 --> 22:05.518
No. Like I had recruited

22:05.518 --> 22:09.229
But you're a minor.
You had a waiver of a year.

22:15.680 --> 22:18.035
Not while you're here.

22:21.200 --> 22:24.590
Honestly I do not want to lose.

22:25.720 --> 22:27.358
Not for the world

22:30.040 --> 22:31.758
Thank you.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.275
Good evening, Ed

23:08.440 --> 23:11.591

Awaken... wake up!
Take your seats! Let's wake up!!

24:07.520 --> 24:13.675
Why are we doing this, Macfarlane?
Tell me that. Why? Why?

24:13.675 --> 24:17.389
We must remain so in
If they attack us. .

24:18.760 --> 24:22.116
We will attack anyway...
Tomorrow... .

24:22.116 --> 24:25.511
Or the next day
I know. .

24:25.511 --> 24:28.148
Why do we attack?

24:28.148 --> 24:30.468
Hey You two, shut up!

25:04.880 --> 25:08.350
Some men are not
properly dressed, Sergeant

25:08.350 --> 25:09.550
Yes sir!

25:10.720 --> 25:13.871
What are you waiting for?

25:13.871 --> 25:17.635
The order...
Then you will have breakfast.

25:19.640 --> 25:22.234
Good luck, Macfarlane.

25:22.234 --> 25:24.516
Tell me what you see
- Do not be stupid. .

25:27.480 --> 25:29.391
At ease!

25:39.320 --> 25:43.313
Do not Let MacFarlane would see how they are
German lines?

25:43.313 --> 25:45.710
Come on, Eddie.

25:45.710 --> 25:48.917
Just for a moment
I give you two pounds. .

25:48.917 --> 25:52.914
Look at yourself
- You're standing there, friend. .

25:57.320 --> 26:01.598
For two pounds. . No nonsense
- They are yours, Ed

26:01.598 --> 26:03.751
Tell us what you see.

26:12.160 --> 26:16.995
Nothing appears
It's just a grassy hill.

26:16.995 --> 26:22.029
I see the topsoil.
-. That's it?

26:22.029 --> 26:26.034
It's just a hill
leading to a quarry.

26:27.360 --> 26:31.273
A half mile away
the grass moves. .

26:33.280 --> 26:36.716
He is calm
Only pastures that slope

26:37.960 --> 26:39.712
They are run at the side...

26:41.640 --> 26:43.232
He is calm...

26:46.200 --> 26:48.031
This is not worth two pounds, fuck

27:21.280 --> 27:24.829
Medico!
Bring a doctor of shit. !

27:38.800 --> 27:41.394
Is he dead?

27:55.640 --> 27:58.518
All out of the way.

28:04.240 --> 28:07.755
They are stupid!

28:10.120 --> 28:14.352
He was a real stupid!
because I was listening. !

28:15.480 --> 28:19.189
It was a lucky man
- What did you say. ?

28:20.600 --> 28:24.593
Think about it, Billy
He was lucky.

28:31.600 --> 28:34.034
Was this your idea, soldier?

28:35.640 --> 28:39.519
I do not know what happened Sergeant
He said everything was safe. .

28:40.360 --> 28:42.920
He looked through the peephole
and then came the Bang...

28:46.080 --> 28:48.833
Here's a cut.

28:50.760 --> 28:53.354
A "gift" Macfarlane.

28:55.160 --> 28:59.915
I think Eddie will be fine
- Del also has a head injury. .

28:59.915 --> 29:02.913
I'm sure I saw a drop of blood.

29:04.920 --> 29:07.388
It will be a bloody scar.

29:07.388 --> 29:10.950
Dell, was a tooth or incisor?

29:11.840 --> 29:16.516
You can tell your grandchildren that
turned out to injured by a flying tooth

29:18.400 --> 29:21.278
Why do not you finish?, Hoggschijt.

29:21.278 --> 29:24.876
It was because of your dirty pictures
they brought bad luck. .

29:24.876 --> 29:27.429
Andá right to Sunday school.
newly

29:27.429 --> 29:30.592
If... these dirty pictures have cursed us. .

29:30.592 --> 29:34.230
You should not have brought them
- That's right, that if any would not have brought

29:34.230 --> 29:37.392
God knows I will do with the rest of you

29:38.240 --> 29:40.800
They are just naughty pictures is all

29:40.800 --> 29:44.953
Jesus!
It was just for fun.

29:46.120 --> 29:49.510
Bunch of fucking idiots!

29:57.880 --> 30:00.713
We can not allow ourselves to be in
our appearance.

30:00.713 --> 30:03.075
Truth?, Macfarlane?

30:09.960 --> 30:12.155
Want tea, Macfarlane?

30:20.080 --> 30:22.435
Sorry about your brother.

30:22.435 --> 30:26.718
But maybe it's better this way
Maybe he goes home. .

30:27.960 --> 30:33.353
You know that. in months
Far from this misery.

30:34.240 --> 30:37.437
It will not hurt to go home. .

30:41.120 --> 30:44.749
He did not want to miss it
- He was a decent man.

30:45.720 --> 30:49.998
We'll be fine
- He's not dead, Dennis. .

30:50.800 --> 30:52.995
I know... . I know. Sorry

30:53.560 --> 30:59.317
But he asked if he could pass
If something happened. .

31:03.280 --> 31:06.272
Have you ever talked to you?
- What did

31:06.272 --> 31:10.353
He said he was convinced

31:12.840 --> 31:16.071
Listen, I have a mission, Dennis.

31:16.071 --> 31:19.516
I have eighteen years.

31:20.800 --> 31:23.314

Fuck, fucking

31:35.720 --> 31:37.836
I know you're upset.

The lucky chosen. . "

31:55.880 --> 31:58.838
"We band of brothers... "

I had six photos. Now there are five.
Some of you have been.

his heart to another.

35:04.240 --> 35:06.913

35:08.920 --> 35:14.916
The title says: "Senior

35:14.916 --> 35:18.595
"Morale is good. "
Tell me what you want Mr.

35:18.595 --> 35:21.832

- No need to repeat it anyway?

35:45.110 --> 35:49.910
Do not just follow where it was
I forgot, but...

35:49.910 --> 35:54.551
Geoffrey Ready?

to advance.

36:07.880 --> 36:12.032
If you come to Montauban,
see that all Germans are dead.

36:12.032 --> 36:16.512
Not even a rat have survived.

36:17.680 --> 36:20.240

Success is guaranteed.

36:37.154 --> 36:40.551
Expected

rifle on his shoulder...

36:45.191 --> 36:47.715

a pipe or a cigarette...

36:47.715 --> 36:52.590

without seeing a trace of German life.

36:53.440 --> 36:57.228
Thumbs up, helmets, but
joy.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.878
Thank you, Colonel.

39:05.316 --> 39:09.439
For make no mistake
None.

39:09.439 --> 39:14.116

If you do not destroy

39:18.360 --> 39:21.318
I'll make you shit

39:46.240 --> 39:48.276
What happened?

39:49.640 --> 39:53.679
Well, take a hill.

39:53.679 --> 39:59.472
But damn... a damn mile behind
front. Right?

39:59.472 --> 40:03.235
<i> if a mile, yes
You could see the German line. &lt;/ I&gt;</i>

40:03.235 --> 40:05.550
Just went up there and then...

40:05.550 --> 40:09.269
Boom, out of nowhere shot
The kids started screaming.

40:09.269 --> 40:12.398
They fell to the ground... Dead

40:13.560 --> 40:16.632
Jesus!
- There was dead silence.

40:16.632 --> 40:18.677
Bullets whizzed

40:19.520 --> 40:23.559
The boys shouted
and ran in all directions.

40:23.559 --> 40:25.995
How was that?

40:25.995 --> 40:29.709
The Germans
They have not seen them there on the hill

40:29.709 --> 40:33.509
We shot with a machine gun
in an arc. and good night.

40:40.120 --> 40:44.910
We were too far away to hear anything
- Damn it. . What did you do?

40:44.910 --> 40:49.596
I covered and I started to walk
-. We got lucky.

40:49.596 --> 40:54.754
Many children died there
-We had a damn lucky. .

40:57.520 --> 40:59.875
It was so sudden, I tell

41:00.920 --> 41:05.755
Come on, George. It was so sudden
. We were there...

41:05.755 --> 41:10.630
... we had only a few days
and we think... .

41:10.630 --> 41:14.395
His family does not know yet
- You could have told me.

41:14.395 --> 41:19.475
You're "pulling" my best friend
How do you think I feel. ?

41:19.475 --> 41:23.633
When finished, Hogg
andd to Supplies.

41:25.240 --> 41:28.437
And Rookwood, fast!
Hogg walks alongside. .

41:29.640 --> 41:32.552
And you, Opzouten also

41:35.080 --> 41:37.071
Why do they call him Rag?

41:37.920 --> 41:40.992
Because he looks like a mop. ?

41:43.760 --> 41:46.911
You know why we call him Charlie?
- Why not?

41:46.911 --> 41:48.991
Because you're so hot.

41:54.280 --> 41:56.589
I'm not happy, Horace.

41:57.640 --> 41:59.949
I'm still not happy.

41:59.949 --> 42:03.351
Come on, George
A year has passed since then. .

42:08.080 --> 42:12.392
How you gonna get 2000 pounds of him?
Why the letters??

42:12.392 --> 42:16.235
That stupid game
- Honestly earned. ?

42:16.235 --> 42:20.552
When we return, will the money, huh
- You're going to be rich. , I tell

42:22.360 --> 42:24.590
Show me that game.

42:34.400 --> 42:36.675
I just had a nice dream.

42:38.840 --> 42:42.719
I was in Southport, on the boulevard.

42:42.719 --> 42:45.314
With a very charming lady.

43:03.040 --> 43:06.430
zVos you think that... ? I have an idea

43:08.800 --> 43:12.793
Is it possible that someone once can...

43:12.793 --> 43:18.796
... that in 2 or 3 sentences...

43:18.796 --> 43:22.794
... Not important, but
is there anyway...

43:22.794 --> 43:25.633
... Something special about it. .

43:25.633 --> 43:28.633
... Or something like that.

43:29.440 --> 43:31.795
Asked fascinating Macfarlane.

43:31.795 --> 43:35.839
You are talking nonsense. Gibberish.
Say what you mean.

43:35.839 --> 43:40.790
I have not met anyone
what I said is not much, but... .

43:42.280 --> 43:45.033
... but I think something special
between us.

43:46.160 --> 43:49.470
Well...
This phenomenon, Billy...

43:51.080 --> 43:55.039
... It's called "love at first sight '
- I know.

43:56.200 --> 43:59.875
I was sure it was mutual.

43:59.875 --> 44:03.191
So it's not reciprocal of the girl?

44:04.840 --> 44:09.755
No. Just what I said
She feels the same.

44:09.755 --> 44:14.869
And z did you say in that
memorable encounter?

44:14.869 --> 44:17.600
I remember exactly.

44:17.600 --> 44:21.634
I said... I said:

44:23.520 --> 44:27.069
Why I can please make a postal sending
for a shilling?

44:27.069 --> 44:33.156
And what you said then Julia?
- No, her name was Mary. Maria Corrigan.

44:35.200 --> 44:37.953
She said... I think it was well...

44:41.680 --> 44:44.990
They begin to return fire
-That was close

44:44.990 --> 44:48.948
Macfarlane. see the battalion.

44:48.948 --> 44:52.954
Come to help the detachment of
rations?

44:52.954 --> 44:57.272
Continue, huh Billy?
- Let's move!

44:58.640 --> 45:01.791
And you go to relieve Digby

47:40.120 --> 47:42.588
Where have you been, Macfarlane?

47:43.800 --> 47:45.552
Arise. !!

47:46.640 --> 47:50.155
What's the matter boy?
Come decímelo!

47:50.155 --> 47:54.074
Macfarlane!
... - What's wrong?

47:56.960 --> 47:58.712
What is it?

48:00.920 --> 48:03.718
He'll be fine...

48:03.718 --> 48:06.075
It's just a shock

48:06.075 --> 48:09.550
I can not imagine something so bad. .

48:09.550 --> 48:11.278
Bad luck

48:13.160 --> 48:15.993
Ultimately, it is
luck.

48:18.680 --> 48:20.671
What do you mean?

48:23.160 --> 48:23.880
All...

48:26.400 --> 48:30.075
I chose three rations for departure
It could have been anyone. .

48:30.920 --> 48:35.038
Good luck to those who chose not
bad luck for those who do

48:37.880 --> 48:39.757
That's a bit brutal.

48:41.200 --> 48:43.191
You mean... no sense.

48:44.080 --> 48:47.311
Who says I'm lucky?

48:47.311 --> 48:50.552
Or you, Lieutenant.

48:57.640 --> 49:00.916
Probably never thought
you'd come here.

49:07.640 --> 49:11.599
I was hoping to start cultivating cotton
in South Africa, so...

49:13.280 --> 49:15.077
There you...

49:16.920 --> 49:21.630
What about you?
- Luck has nothing to do with it.

49:21.630 --> 49:26.078
I am a professional soldier
- Ah. I see. .

49:35.320 --> 49:38.392
okay?
- Very well, thank you.

49:42.280 --> 49:44.475
Do you like fish? Sergeant

49:46.600 --> 49:50.070
A little fish never displeased
-. I miss that.

49:52.080 --> 49:56.676
My family had a house in Scotland
where you can go fishing. .

49:56.676 --> 50:00.719
Strange that
- I've never been to Scotland. .

50:00.719 --> 50:04.634
I hear it's quite nice
- Sure. .

50:04.634 --> 50:08.395
Are you all married, Sergeant?
- Yes

50:10.360 --> 50:11.080
Children?

50:13.800 --> 50:15.756
Two girls and a boy.

50:18.160 --> 50:19.957
Thank you.

50:20.920 --> 50:24.230
Cute family... . Beautiful daughters.

50:26.760 --> 50:29.354
It's a lucky man, Sgt.
Of luck...

50:37.760 --> 50:40.558
Can I do anything for you, sir?

50:55.760 --> 50:59.833
The Germans have a
trench dug around here... .

50:59.833 --> 51:02.719
... Maybe some sort of post
listening.

51:02.719 --> 51:06.919
The captain wants a patrol
there to investigate what happens...

51:06.919 --> 51:10.755
... And take action
when they detect someone there

51:10.755 --> 51:13.832
A patrol. How many men?

51:13.832 --> 51:18.630
As little or as much as you want
That's something I... .

51:18.840 --> 51:22.071
... I must decide before the attack.

51:30.200 --> 51:33.476
These things
been done before, huh?

51:37.160 --> 51:39.435
Often

52:37.360 --> 52:39.237
You were right.

52:45.160 --> 52:47.628
Poor Rag and CharliezEh?

52:50.720 --> 52:53.109
We have a damn lucky.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.309
It was a disaster, right?

52:58.800 --> 53:01.598
It was just...

53:01.598 --> 53:03.910
... a slaughter

53:03.910 --> 53:06.878
Rag and Charlie... .

53:06.878 --> 53:10.476
There was nothing
- ZVos. .

53:11.560 --> 53:14.552
zVos saw something of Hoggie?

53:16.360 --> 53:19.113
He was somewhere in the side

53:20.440 --> 53:22.635
I hate...

53:23.920 --> 53:26.912
... So we're not done. .

53:26.912 --> 53:31.631
You impending marriage
- I know what that means, Daventry.

53:31.631 --> 53:35.270
Me too
- That was funny or clever. ?.

53:35.270 --> 53:40.070
At all
- It's not fucking funny. Hoggie is dead.

53:40.070 --> 53:42.913
You're alive
- Yes...

53:46.440 --> 53:48.874
But why much damn time?

53:53.760 --> 53:56.354
Macfarlane, come here.

54:03.760 --> 54:07.753
It's a sarcastic asshole
He finds it funny muu

54:10.560 --> 54:12.755
Poor old George

54:14.840 --> 54:17.479
Now I have to kill more Germans.

54:18.040 --> 54:21.112
Are you okay?
- Yes, if Sgt.

but otherwise okay.

54:30.268 --> 54:33.000

Good luck to you too

56:21.320 --> 56:25.677
We still need a password
for when we return.

56:25.677 --> 56:27.831
How about Shakespeare?

56:29.080 --> 56:32.675
<i> "Victor Ludorum"

56:32.675 --> 56:37.550

56:47.160 --> 56:48.752
Well, Beckwith.

56:49.880 --> 56:51.950
Let's put things in order.

56:56.320 --> 57:00.233
Every fifteen minutes
shoot a ball of green light. .

57:00.233 --> 57:02.868
Every fifteen minutes
- Yes, Lieutenant.

57:16.240 --> 57:19.915
What an idiot, that is Mr. Harte
- You have a damn right. .

57:21.200 --> 57:24.590
He can not help it
- Why not. ?

57:26.400 --> 57:28.834
If you do?
He's like home

57:28.834 --> 57:29.554
Certain

57:38.200 --> 57:40.555
I can not see anything.

57:52.120 --> 57:54.588
What the hell is that?.

57:59.360 --> 58:01.555
This is not English
- Not true.

58:03.640 --> 58:06.632
God, What will happen to Beckwith and Winter?
Jesus!

58:21.520 --> 58:23.715
Just hope you are well.

58:41.600 --> 58:43.556
I have still two more.

58:46.320 --> 58:49.551
"Post Office"
Here. Come here!

58:49.551 --> 58:53.713
Avisale Harte, Cornwallis!
"Post office. ".

58:56.680 --> 58:58.955
We have a surprise for
Units boys...

59:01.200 --> 59:03.156
Erin, you.

59:11.160 --> 59:14.994
Shut up. Silence.

59:14.994 --> 59:17.276
Shut up. !

59:21.480 --> 59:23.710
Shut you whore mouth. !

59:35.200 --> 59:37.919
Mantenenganlo at gunpoint

59:39.520 --> 59:42.671
Let anybody wants to put
above rifle?

59:48.040 --> 59:51.112
He walked around a daze,
after the grenades exploded

59:51.112 --> 59:54.716
Do not know where I was
He walked straight towards us.

59:57.760 --> 01:00:00.672
And that noise
We heard screams.

01:00:00.672 --> 01:00:03.798
We heard nothing
The explosions we had deaf. .

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:09.750
Maybe it was an integral
of the trench

01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:12.957
I heard nothing after the explosions.

01:00:12.957 --> 01:00:18.274
It was funny. When we approach
his line, I heard them sing.

01:00:18.274 --> 01:00:21.034
Below the earth, in their shelters.

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:25.512
They may have the courage to
keep up. .

01:00:25.512 --> 01:00:29.070
They are determined to fight, after five days
- Singing?

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:33.916
And the barbed wire?
- There are still plenty left.

01:00:33.916 --> 01:00:38.596
After all those grenades? Jesus is going on here?
- Their trenches were broken.

01:00:38.596 --> 01:00:42.435
Look what happens with him.
He shakes like a fucking rabbit.

01:00:42.435 --> 01:00:45.990
If you like a fucking rat!
-Jesus Christ!. .

01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:50.351
They are stupid

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:54.437
What?

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:57.595
Nothing works as it should.

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:02.674
They sit there
They're waiting for us. .

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:09.116
Boy! I'm talking to you

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:13.829
Were you singing? Was it so?
Come on...

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:25.478
Tomorrow sing no more
There is no doubt about it. . !

01:01:25.478 --> 01:01:29.553
OK
I just saw a red mist.

01:01:29.553 --> 01:01:33.076
We would have to kill him
What are you doing?

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:42.677
Here, take one

01:01:42.677 --> 01:01:45.513
Do not worry about it
It's a crazy guy

01:01:45.513 --> 01:01:47.750
Forward. You've had enough.

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:51.638

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:48.597
Come and Stay Daventry

01:02:48.597 --> 01:02:52.594
Making friends with the enemy
What a terrible crime! No?

01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:57.915
He is a fellow of luck.

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:03.038
We are fucking idiots
Wait and see.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.471
What's wrong?
- God knows. It's a freak.

01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:20.038
Beckwith, we will take the command

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:23.674
Goodbye. Thank you.

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:28.559
Shut up!
Shut the fuck up.

01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:57.238

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:06.751
I can not stop...

01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:13.588
I can not stop thinking

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:19.269
Yes, if I know what you mean.

01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:26.673
Want some jam?
My wife made

01:05:26.673 --> 01:05:29.513
I try to eat it
but too.

01:05:29.513 --> 01:05:32.194
Strawberries, from my own garden
Delicious

01:05:32.194 --> 01:05:35.432

Please, I'm tired
- You eat them

01:05:43.234 --> 01:05:47.279
Do not be silly
Everyone loves strawberries.

01:05:47.279 --> 01:05:50.273
Not that I have between the teeth.

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:00.670
Go

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:55.235
You're the fucking thief, Dell
What were you doing Eddie?

01:07:55.235 --> 01:08:00.554
He is a thief and he has my photo
- You're a fucking liar. . liar

01:08:00.554 --> 01:08:02.995
Calm down. What is going on here?

01:08:02.995 --> 01:08:06.755
Let me... let me!
He checked things my brother Eddie. .

01:08:06.755 --> 01:08:12.119
Now listen
His brother has my picture there.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.595
Find her then, but if not I will ask
pardon me you will ask forgiveness from Eddie.

01:08:16.595 --> 01:08:20.719
Damn, I'll kill you
- Yes, we are.

01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:24.598
Well, I will not do anything.

01:08:24.598 --> 01:08:28.116
I'm not doing anything. Just wanted to see.

01:08:28.116 --> 01:08:31.078
That lee no damage?
Right?

01:08:31.078 --> 01:08:34.595
Bastardo, Dell.
Bastard

01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:39.868
Go away the devil!
I do not need.

01:08:50.279 --> 01:08:53.477
July 1, 1916

01:09:48.359 --> 01:09:50.112
Come on, guys!

01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:51.760
Hurry up!

01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:56.752
Wake up, Beckwith. !

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:13.760
Where is he?
- In the reserve. taking orders

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:18.471
Make sure you come quick
- Not until you eat

01:10:18.471 --> 01:10:22.872
Why?
- Because for Hate is good, I think.

01:10:22.872 --> 01:10:26.112
Did you tell?
- I wanted to surprise

01:10:26.112 --> 01:10:29.078
Then put a cup of tea for him
in the German line.

01:10:29.078 --> 01:10:31.800
All right. All right.

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:34.269
It seems to be a good day.

01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:41.196
Well, you know,
in other circumstances.

01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:13.676
A 7. 30.

01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:18.912
07: 30 AM
It is in broad daylight.

01:11:18.912 --> 01:11:23.073
It's time
they have planned. Can not change.

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:33.038
Can you get this food here, please?
- Immediately, Sr

01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:48.509
I have no appetite.

01:11:48.509 --> 01:11:52.389
One day
I do not want a full stomach.

01:11:52.389 --> 01:11:56.439
Never eat anything
- Very wise. .

01:11:57.800 --> 01:11:59.791
There's more...

01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:05.718
Orders have changed
Actually, there is something that went wrong. .

01:12:05.718 --> 01:12:09.350
Two companies were lost
overnight

01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:13.308
Is equiviocaron of communication trincera
is ridiculous.

01:12:13.308 --> 01:12:16.711
So there is a great lack of men.

01:12:16.711 --> 01:12:20.111
The squad will
with the rest of the company... .

01:12:20.111 --> 01:12:22.271
... With the first wave.

01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:28.355
That's not good.

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:31.396
Not with this group.

01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:39.637
There's nothing we can do nothing
Orders have changed. .

01:12:39.637 --> 01:12:42.598
And men have to...

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:46.434
The men have...

01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:51.920
Yes, and there's one more thing.

01:12:54.884 --> 01:12:56.826
The captain has given each platoon
a soccer ball.

01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:01.216
<i> "The Great European Cup Final: Troupe" C "
Vs The Huns "&lt;/ i&gt;</i>

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:06.113
The platoon giving kicks here first
Germans in the lines, you get a beer barrel.

01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:13.514
The captain seemed good for morale
have some fun, he said.

01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:18.438
That clever idea...

01:13:18.438 --> 01:13:21.194
They will be ready at 7. .

01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:26.953
We'll need rum now, sir
- Of course.

01:13:26.953 --> 01:13:29.680
Ensure that, Sergeant?

01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:32.593
What was that?
Where did that?

01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:46.508
It was an accident, Sergeant

01:13:46.508 --> 01:13:50.434
I put my rifle against
wall and fell to the floor.

01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:56.635
It was an accident, Sgt.

01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:05.754
Now he's dead, Cornwallis.

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:12.555
I can not believe I did that.

01:14:12.555 --> 01:14:16.554
They're all alike
Chats, until the time comes.

01:14:16.554 --> 01:14:21.350
This is a court-martial
- Firing squad, no doubt about it. .

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:26.918
Do you think he knew something?
Why would you do differently?

01:14:26.918 --> 01:14:29.594
I'll tell you.

01:14:29.594 --> 01:14:33.230
Because he is not a hero, like you and me.

01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:39.278
Go to the Troupe, and bring us
rum. Bone will point the way.

01:14:39.278 --> 01:14:41.590
At this time, Sergeant?

01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:45.548
Cape, should be here in fifteen minutes
Hurry up

01:14:45.548 --> 01:14:49.110
Beckwith, I have a gift for you.

01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:25.829
Billy, this ball is as good
as what's inside.

01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:59.998
Where are you going?
- I have to bring the rum

01:15:59.998 --> 01:16:02.390
Here's a whole battalion.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.549
Are you sure you told Dell to go?
- I could be wrong, Sergeant. .

01:18:09.549 --> 01:18:13.554
Even in the dark, I could not
- That son of a bitch.

01:18:13.554 --> 01:18:17.156
Where is whiskey Harte?

01:18:17.156 --> 01:18:19.436
I do not know, Sergeant
-. How much are the damn whiskey?

01:18:19.436 --> 01:18:23.275
Two bottles, Sergeant
Two and a bit.

01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:40.636
There was an explosion, Sergeant.

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:12.910
Now you come with me, son

01:19:12.910 --> 01:19:14.638
Beckwith. !

01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:19.359
Around here, and quickly!
Put it ready!

01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:37.193
What is it? What do you want?
- No rum. The ration perdío.

01:19:37.193 --> 01:19:40.193
Request permission to use his whiskey, Sr

01:19:40.193 --> 01:19:44.797
What are you saying?. Certainly not
- These men can not go without rum

01:19:44.797 --> 01:19:50.353
We give them a sip of his whiskey
some courage, make five yards ahead.

01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:58.873
Permission to use his whiskey
then you can recover

01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:04.192
No, out of the question
Permission denied.

01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:14.796
I said no
- You know it works. .

01:20:14.796 --> 01:20:18.077
Offer it with
"Greetings from Lieutenant '

01:20:18.077 --> 01:20:22.028
Then will follow you everywhere
To hell and back. .

01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:30.112
At any other time would have arrested
and defendant

01:20:55.178 --> 01:20:56.717
zSargento?
-What?

01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:03.636
Sergeant, you've done this before, huh?
If

01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:08.397
How do you think?

01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:13.279
You should not think about it
Remember that your homework. . / / I mean...

01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:16.949
I mean: Did you have fear?

01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:19.916
Yes, I had

01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:24.120
But you have no time to be afraid.

01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:27.793
It's too...

01:21:27.793 --> 01:21:29.916
Too weird.

01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:36.597
If you attack,
entering another world.

01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:40.115
A place where nothing...

01:21:40.115 --> 01:21:44.910
Compliments of Lieutenant.

01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:53.079
Compliments of Lieutenant.

01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:16.716
Sergeant... zShooting something
even on a day like today?.

01:22:16.716 --> 01:22:19.197
No, thank you sir

01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:25.188
That was it, Lieutenant
- Well.

01:22:25.188 --> 01:22:29.911
Back to the reserve trench
- No, I'm with you, sir.

01:22:29.911 --> 01:22:32.992
Who is going to do differently the tea?

01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:34.880
Well

01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:38.957
Thank you.

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:47.998
Place!...

01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:53.750
... Bayonets. !

01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:16.400
I feel bad, Horace.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.434
I can not, Horace.

01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:25.156
You'll be fine immediately
Come on. .

01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:37.152
Come on.

01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:22.872
I'll go first, you can go behind me. ?
If Sergeant

01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:30.631
Are you okay?
- Yes

01:25:30.631 --> 01:25:33.189
Yes, I feel good.

01:25:33.189 --> 01:25:37.353
I'm ready. Completely.

01:25:37.353 --> 01:25:39.954
That's the spirit

01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:54.389
That's your girlfriend?

01:25:57.320 --> 01:26:01.154
Her name is Mary
She works at the post office. .

01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:26.555
What do we do now, Sergeant?
- Wait...

01:26:33.590 --> 01:26:34.684
Sergeant...
What?

01:26:36.187 --> 01:26:37.218
There is something that worries me

01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:41.798
What if...

01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:47.112
... Something happens?

01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:50.351
Maybe something happens to me.

01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:54.795
Maybe even you...

01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:03.033
I mean, this idea that I have.

01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:05.837
It bothers me.

01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:11.676
You'll be fine
Do not worry, son

01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:16.674
I always see you.

01:27:16.674 --> 01:27:20.230
I know you're the type who is saved
And you... .

01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:22.720
Outside!

01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:02.071
Come on, Billy. Damn.

01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:21.758
Come here, Macfarlane
Or I'll shoot. !

01:28:21.758 --> 01:28:22.478
Move it now!

01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:26.029
The July 1, 1916, the first day
the battle of the Somme...

01:30:26.029 --> 01:30:29.112
... 60,000 soldiers were killed or wounded...

01:30:29.112 --> 01:30:32.272
... Especially during the first
two hours after the attack.

01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:39.834
It remains one of the bloodiest days
in the history of the British Army.
