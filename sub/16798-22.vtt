00:13.475 --> 00:15.844
Dr. Zanner.

00:15.845 --> 00:19.548
Our partners would like
an update on your progress.

00:19.549 --> 00:22.317
See for yourselves.

00:22.318 --> 00:25.520
80% kill rate within two weeks.

00:28.591 --> 00:31.026
Makes Ebola look like
the common cold, huh?

00:31.027 --> 00:34.094
The virus is airborne, friends.

00:36.198 --> 00:38.066
And preparations

00:38.067 --> 00:41.103
continue for the G20
Conference on Banking Secrecy.

00:41.104 --> 00:43.638
We leave for Rome the
day after tomorrow, ma'am.

00:43.639 --> 00:46.508
Ah, Roma, city of carbs.

00:46.509 --> 00:48.343
Have to admit, I've been dreaming

00:48.344 --> 00:50.611
about the stracci for the past week.

00:51.413 --> 00:54.516
And a deal with Russia
on... tax avoidance.

00:54.517 --> 00:56.384
So, where are we on that?

00:56.385 --> 00:58.553
Sadly, still in the Gulag.

00:58.554 --> 01:00.122
President Salnikov is making noises

01:00.123 --> 01:02.390
about rejecting the entire
framework agreement outright.

01:02.391 --> 01:03.625
The fact is,

01:03.626 --> 01:06.394
Russia welcomes the money
American billionaires hide

01:06.395 --> 01:07.996
in dummy Russian corporations.

01:07.997 --> 01:10.365
But frankly, plenty of Russian oligarchs

01:10.366 --> 01:13.101
do the same thing here in the U.S.

01:13.102 --> 01:15.036
So they're willing to look the other way

01:15.037 --> 01:16.972
when terrorists hide their money,

01:16.973 --> 01:19.274
as long as the billionaires are happy.

01:19.275 --> 01:21.009
With the rhetoric coming
out of the Kremlin,

01:21.010 --> 01:23.278
the gaggle wants to know
if it's Cold War 2.0.

01:23.279 --> 01:25.680
Oh, come on, we're not
even close to a cold war.

01:25.681 --> 01:28.016
A little chilly, maybe.

01:28.017 --> 01:30.884
Ma'am, you're needed in the White House.

01:31.686 --> 01:34.623
All right, find out what Salnikov wants.

01:34.624 --> 01:37.392
Two hours ago, Jordanian
West Bank border.

01:37.393 --> 01:39.394
This vehicle way back in the line,

01:39.395 --> 01:41.596
that's Reverend Andrew Slattery.

01:41.597 --> 01:44.733
We believe that the two
men on either side are.

01:44.734 --> 01:46.301
Dr. Bill Zanner and Lance Abbot.

01:46.302 --> 01:48.403
Our missing doomsday cult members.

01:48.404 --> 01:50.372
We identified the two men in front

01:50.373 --> 01:52.340
as Al-Qaeda-in-Syria lieutenants.

01:52.341 --> 01:53.542
I take it

01:53.543 --> 01:56.111
this isn't a cross-cultural
exchange program.

01:56.112 --> 01:58.013
Confirms our theory
that the VFF and Al-Qaeda

01:58.014 --> 01:59.281
are working together.

01:59.282 --> 02:01.383
And now they're inside Israel.

02:01.384 --> 02:02.751
Not necessarily.

02:02.752 --> 02:05.020
Based on our warnings,

02:05.021 --> 02:08.190
IDF had beefed up security
on all border checkpoints.

02:08.191 --> 02:09.524
Moments after this

02:09.525 --> 02:11.960
was taken, they turned
around, bugged out.

02:11.961 --> 02:13.895
Our best guess is that
they'll make another run

02:13.896 --> 02:15.664
at getting into Israel
through a smuggling tunnel.

02:15.665 --> 02:17.866
Okay. Doesn't Israel know the location

02:17.867 --> 02:19.834
- of those tunnels?
- Not all of them.

02:19.835 --> 02:21.769
But the Palestinians do.

02:24.172 --> 02:25.574
We can ask,

02:25.575 --> 02:28.376
but I doubt the Palestinian Authority

02:28.377 --> 02:30.779
wants to give up its only
real strategic advantage

02:30.780 --> 02:33.782
to Israel.

02:33.783 --> 02:35.517
What else, Ephraim?

02:35.518 --> 02:40.722
I'd like to send a joint
CIA-FBI task force to Jerusalem

02:40.723 --> 02:42.390
to liaise with Mossad,

02:42.391 --> 02:45.060
so we can work shared Intel in real time.

02:45.061 --> 02:47.596
Just Agent Maloof and Dr. McCord

02:47.597 --> 02:50.264
- and a support team.
- Excuse me?

02:51.399 --> 02:55.336
I-I mean, I'm-I'm... sorry.
Did you know about this?

02:56.171 --> 02:57.938
Yeah.

02:59.274 --> 03:00.542
Huh.

03:00.543 --> 03:02.876
It just came up this morning.

03:04.746 --> 03:06.514
Well, as much

03:06.515 --> 03:08.016
as I'd like to see where...

03:08.017 --> 03:11.519
this goes, if nobody has anything else...

03:11.520 --> 03:13.821
It's not that...

03:14.589 --> 03:16.491
You ambushed me.

03:16.492 --> 03:19.628
I would have told you,
but we were a little busy

03:19.629 --> 03:21.162
trying to prevent a bio-terror attack.

03:21.163 --> 03:25.467
If only there were some
method of communication

03:25.468 --> 03:29.070
where you could send messages
almost instantaneously.

03:29.071 --> 03:31.372
I'm sorry you felt ambushed.

03:31.973 --> 03:33.341
I'm sorry that I called you out

03:33.342 --> 03:35.542
in front of the leader of the free world.

03:36.778 --> 03:39.147
I just find it surprising that a guy

03:39.148 --> 03:41.816
who was shot multiple
times not two months ago

03:41.817 --> 03:43.785
and is still on crutches
is going to oversee

03:43.786 --> 03:45.553
a field op halfway around the world.

03:45.554 --> 03:48.256
Babe. I've been on point
with the VFF mission

03:48.257 --> 03:50.325
since the beginning... are
you really that surprised?

03:50.326 --> 03:52.193
Okay, okay, it's not that
you're going, it's that you

03:52.194 --> 03:53.695
- didn't tell me.
- No, it's that I'm going.

03:53.696 --> 03:56.931
- Are you really gonna push me on this?
- I'm sorry you felt ambushed.

03:56.932 --> 03:59.267
Elizabeth. We have the
Israeli and Palestinian leaders

03:59.268 --> 04:01.034
- on the line.
- Okay.

04:03.838 --> 04:06.408
Am I at least gonna see you at home?

04:06.409 --> 04:08.610
Yeah. We're not leaving till tonight.

04:08.611 --> 04:12.013
I'd say "break a leg," Henry, but...

04:12.014 --> 04:13.915
Seriously, good luck.

04:13.916 --> 04:16.418
We will share information
with your government,

04:16.418 --> 04:18.486
President Dalton, but not with Israel.

04:18.487 --> 04:20.755
That won't work, President Sayedd.

04:20.755 --> 04:22.991
Mossad has to run point on this.

04:22.992 --> 04:24.492
You really think we don't know

04:24.493 --> 04:25.794
about your smuggling tunnels, Bassam?

04:25.795 --> 04:27.295
If we had such tunnels,

04:27.296 --> 04:29.030
they would be to bring vital supplies

04:29.031 --> 04:30.665
that your government deprives us.

04:30.666 --> 04:34.002
- Nonsense. They are to attack us.
- To defend ourselves!

04:34.003 --> 04:36.905
Gentlemen, you've seen
our intelligence briefs.

04:36.906 --> 04:39.307
There are only a few
hundred people on the planet

04:39.308 --> 04:41.910
with the expertise to whip up a superbug

04:41.911 --> 04:43.111
that can kill millions.

04:43.112 --> 04:44.612
Dr. Zanner is one of them.

04:44.613 --> 04:46.514
We're not going to achieve peace

04:46.515 --> 04:48.016
in the Middle East today.

04:48.017 --> 04:50.952
But if you don't cooperate on this...

04:50.953 --> 04:53.154
it might not matter.

04:53.155 --> 04:55.757
They both called

04:55.758 --> 04:58.159
for emergency sessions
of their governments,

04:58.160 --> 05:00.595
and now suddenly everyone's on board.

05:00.596 --> 05:02.163
Well, there's nothing like the power

05:02.164 --> 05:04.665
of the mutually-assured-
destruction card.

05:05.333 --> 05:06.935
Babe,

05:06.936 --> 05:08.336
I'm gonna be fine.

05:08.337 --> 05:12.273
Yeah, so said the man flying
straight into said destruction.

05:12.274 --> 05:14.209
Okay, let's talk about
how you got the Israelis

05:14.210 --> 05:15.810
and the Palestinians to work together.

05:15.811 --> 05:17.545
- Let's focus on that.
- That is pretty cool.

05:17.546 --> 05:19.713
- It's so cool.
- It was very cool.

05:20.915 --> 05:22.317
Hey, um...

05:22.318 --> 05:24.919
what'd you guys want to
talk to me about? I can...

05:24.920 --> 05:25.887
Oh, no, no. Yeah.

05:25.888 --> 05:26.921
- I...
- Okay,

05:26.922 --> 05:28.490
so look, um, Mom has to go

05:28.491 --> 05:30.859
- to this G20 thing in Rome...
- Mm-hmm.

05:30.860 --> 05:32.727
...and I just found
out that I've got to go

05:32.728 --> 05:33.795
to a conference in London, so...

05:33.796 --> 05:35.563
we were wondering if you could, uh,

05:35.564 --> 05:37.132
take over for the next week

05:37.133 --> 05:39.768
and sort of run the show
with your brother and sister?

05:39.769 --> 05:42.336
Oh. Yeah. Sure, no problem.

05:43.071 --> 05:44.272
Really?

05:44.273 --> 05:46.574
Yeah. I mean, your
work is really important

05:46.575 --> 05:48.743
and I'm very happy to help, so...

05:48.744 --> 05:50.779
Cool. Thanks, honey.

05:50.780 --> 05:52.713
Okay. Great.

05:53.581 --> 05:55.383
Well, that was easy.

05:55.384 --> 05:58.520
Yeah. Maybe a little too easy.

05:58.521 --> 06:01.923
We just asked her to spend
the week as a single mother,

06:01.924 --> 06:03.591
and she just... accepted.

06:03.592 --> 06:05.794
She doesn't have any
plans? She's 22-years-old.

06:05.795 --> 06:07.629
What, she and Jareth don't have a life?

06:07.630 --> 06:09.864
They don't live together.
You ever wonder about that?

06:09.865 --> 06:11.199
Maybe she's just a really great kid

06:11.200 --> 06:12.600
who wants to help her parents out.

06:12.601 --> 06:15.270
Or maybe she's a
mustang and we broke her.

06:15.271 --> 06:16.704
And way ahead of schedule.

06:16.705 --> 06:17.806
No, I'm serious.

06:17.807 --> 06:21.309
I had to grow up way too
soon, and it was no fun.

06:21.310 --> 06:22.710
And it did serious damage

06:22.711 --> 06:24.646
to my relationship
with my little brother.

06:24.647 --> 06:27.015
You and Will are fine
and this has nothing to do

06:27.016 --> 06:28.316
with what you guys went through.

06:28.317 --> 06:30.018
I know.

06:30.019 --> 06:32.587
I just don't want to clip her wings.

06:34.457 --> 06:36.456
I got to go.

06:37.692 --> 06:40.827
Wish I could clip your wings.

06:48.482 --> 06:50.493
_

06:55.810 --> 06:57.745
What is it?

07:03.219 --> 07:05.220
The Americans must
have followed you here.

07:05.221 --> 07:06.421
Now, the Israelis

07:06.422 --> 07:07.889
are waiting outside.

07:07.890 --> 07:10.959
There has to be another
way, another tunnel.

07:10.960 --> 07:12.960
Or maybe through Egypt.

07:19.901 --> 07:22.270
Reverend Slattery survived.

07:22.271 --> 07:24.072
He's in surgery

07:24.073 --> 07:25.874
at Yad la Chole hospital in Jerusalem.

07:25.875 --> 07:28.243
Any sign of the drone or bio-weapon?

07:28.244 --> 07:29.677
No, sir.

07:29.678 --> 07:33.548
But the tunnel was being entered
by IDF on the West Bank side

07:33.549 --> 07:35.750
right about the time they were shot.

07:35.751 --> 07:40.154
So, Al-Qaeda got wind and
bailed on the joint attack.

07:40.155 --> 07:42.690
That's our operating theory.

07:42.691 --> 07:46.027
So, we have doomsday weapons in
the hands of hardened terrorists

07:46.028 --> 07:47.996
with unknown intentions

07:47.997 --> 07:50.698
and not a single clue
on their whereabouts.

07:50.699 --> 07:52.467
Is there a more optimistic slant,

07:52.468 --> 07:54.702
or is that about the size of it?

07:54.703 --> 07:56.905
Well, our team just arrived in Jerusalem.

07:56.906 --> 07:59.207
Dr. McCord and Agent Maloof

07:59.208 --> 08:02.109
will be working directly with Mossad.

08:06.479 --> 08:12.664
<font color="#FFDF00">Subtitle sync and corrections by</font>
<font color="#33FF00"><b>awaqeded</b></font> <font color="#FFDF00">for</font> <

08:15.174 --> 08:17.443
Bess, I hear our little intel-sharing op

08:17.444 --> 08:19.578
- with the Israelis has borne fruit.
- Yeah.

08:19.579 --> 08:21.614
I trust your marriage will survive it.

08:21.615 --> 08:23.916
- I mean it.
- I believe you.

08:23.917 --> 08:25.518
Listen, if you're still up for it,

08:25.519 --> 08:27.586
I'd love for you to do what you can

08:27.587 --> 08:29.221
to get Stevie off the wait list

08:29.222 --> 08:31.390
and over the finish line at Harvard Law.

08:31.391 --> 08:34.226
What happened to withdrawing
from the battlefield?

08:34.227 --> 08:37.196
Well, I realized that going
to school in another state

08:37.197 --> 08:38.397
would be good for her.

08:38.398 --> 08:40.633
You know, help her sort
of break out on her own,

08:40.634 --> 08:42.333
- find her own... thing.
- Okay.

08:42.335 --> 08:44.303
The muzzle was starting to chafe.

08:44.304 --> 08:47.273
Thanks. Listen, if we could just keep it

08:47.274 --> 08:49.642
between the two of us,
I think that'd be...

08:49.643 --> 08:53.579
Kind of ironic, asking me
to secretly pull strings

08:53.580 --> 08:56.347
to help make your
daughter more independent.

08:57.650 --> 08:59.585
Wo...

08:59.586 --> 09:01.220
We found Al-Qaeda SIGINT

09:01.221 --> 09:02.688
in Mossad's most recent intercepts

09:02.689 --> 09:05.825
referring to a lab
in Deir ez-Zor, Syria.

09:05.826 --> 09:07.893
With mentions of medical equipment

09:07.894 --> 09:09.095
used to create a virus

09:09.096 --> 09:12.832
and human trials on
captured Syrian soldiers.

09:12.833 --> 09:15.167
Very Mengele-esque.

09:15.168 --> 09:17.536
Deir ez-Zor is in the
middle of the country,

09:17.537 --> 09:19.738
in Al-Qaeda-held territory.

09:19.739 --> 09:21.774
Still, we recommend an op.

09:21.775 --> 09:23.809
It could provide a trove of intelligence.

09:23.810 --> 09:25.945
Trouble is, we're on the rebel side

09:25.946 --> 09:27.213
of a civil war in Syria.

09:27.214 --> 09:28.714
It's one thing to fight Al-Qaeda,

09:28.715 --> 09:30.883
but we'd have to get past
government forces, too.

09:30.884 --> 09:32.485
Well, I can reach out to Avdonin,

09:32.486 --> 09:34.587
see if the Russians are
ready to pave the way

09:34.588 --> 09:36.589
- with the Syrian government.
- Hold our noses

09:36.590 --> 09:38.590
at Russia's human rights abuses in Syria.

09:40.025 --> 09:43.628
Well, how interested are we in that lab?

09:45.564 --> 09:47.399
The Russians would insist on making this

09:47.400 --> 09:48.968
a joint operation, wouldn't they?

09:48.969 --> 09:50.936
That's my expectation.

09:50.937 --> 09:52.638
Well, who knows?

09:52.639 --> 09:54.740
Maybe making nice with Russia and Syria

09:54.741 --> 09:56.208
could light the path

09:56.209 --> 09:58.477
to an agreement in Rome.

09:58.478 --> 10:02.247
My doctor says optimism
lowers blood pressure.

10:03.883 --> 10:06.785
Make the call, Bess.

10:09.155 --> 10:11.190
Hi.

10:11.191 --> 10:13.626
Hearing rumors about military operations

10:13.627 --> 10:14.727
in the Middle East.

10:14.728 --> 10:16.095
Are you?

10:16.096 --> 10:19.365
Just wondering if the
secretary's still planning on

10:19.366 --> 10:21.233
going to the banking conference in Rome.

10:21.234 --> 10:24.103
Yeah, because... conflict
in one area of the world

10:24.104 --> 10:26.405
always derails us from our plans

10:26.406 --> 10:28.340
in a completely different area

10:28.341 --> 10:30.908
- of the world.
- Right. Never mind.

10:36.182 --> 10:38.784
Is there something you'd like to discuss?

10:38.785 --> 10:40.653
No. No.

10:40.654 --> 10:43.455
I mean, I'm not thrilled at the idea

10:43.456 --> 10:45.090
of seeing all my former colleagues

10:45.091 --> 10:47.526
from Baldwin and Wilder
suck up even more profit

10:47.527 --> 10:50.362
under the guise of helping
to defund terrorism, but...

10:50.363 --> 10:52.631
other than that, no.
No, no concern at all.

10:52.632 --> 10:55.134
Oh, right.

10:55.135 --> 10:57.069
You started in finance.

10:57.070 --> 10:59.738
Yeah. One year.

10:59.739 --> 11:02.541
One year as an analyst is all it took

11:02.542 --> 11:04.777
for me to realize it wasn't for me,

11:04.778 --> 11:07.246
and to haunt me for the rest of my days.

11:07.247 --> 11:10.683
So, you have anxiety about
running into old colleagues?

11:10.684 --> 11:13.986
Not unless you count waking
up at 2:00 a.m. in a cold sweat

11:13.987 --> 11:15.888
from stress nightmares
that I'm back there

11:15.889 --> 11:17.790
and all the doors are
locked and I'm naked,

11:17.791 --> 11:19.758
but, well, not really.

11:21.294 --> 11:24.830
I don't know why it's
bothering me so much.

11:24.831 --> 11:27.399
I mean, sure, I went into public service,

11:27.400 --> 11:31.203
and they all stayed and
got filthy rich, but...

11:31.204 --> 11:33.072
Is that what you wanted for yourself?

11:33.073 --> 11:35.074
No.

11:35.075 --> 11:37.009
Maybe.

11:37.010 --> 11:40.512
No. It's just that they're all so...

11:40.513 --> 11:42.448
insanely competitive,

11:42.449 --> 11:45.918
and they're gonna think
of me as a failure.

11:45.919 --> 11:48.921
I know. You think I'm
insanely competitive, too.

11:48.922 --> 11:51.890
I think you have

11:51.891 --> 11:55.227
an admirable drive for excellence.

11:55.228 --> 11:57.096
Oh. God, I'm just as bad as they are.

11:57.097 --> 11:58.731
I knew it. I have to go back to my desk.

11:58.732 --> 12:00.232
- Yes, you do.
- I've got a million...

12:00.233 --> 12:02.500
I-I'm so busy.

12:19.824 --> 12:22.191
_

12:22.608 --> 12:23.307
_

12:35.801 --> 12:38.170
- The area is secure.
- Head for the lab.

12:38.171 --> 12:39.937
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

12:46.979 --> 12:48.347
What's the sitrep, Admiral?

12:48.348 --> 12:50.482
- Alpha One on-site.
- LZ clear.

12:50.483 --> 12:53.217
Making nice with the Russians paid off.

12:59.458 --> 13:01.260
Clear! Let's go!

13:01.261 --> 13:04.530
Let's go. Six minutes to evac! Let's go.

13:04.531 --> 13:06.764
We're in the right place.

13:07.399 --> 13:09.133
Any vials of anything, take 'em.

13:10.235 --> 13:12.603
Check the other one.

13:19.144 --> 13:21.380
What the hell?

13:21.381 --> 13:23.548
Hostiles on a rooftop up the street.

13:27.787 --> 13:31.757
Coord Delta 34.48, 39.14.

13:31.758 --> 13:34.659
Returning volley and
calling in an air strike.

13:46.605 --> 13:48.474
What the hell just happened?

13:48.475 --> 13:51.342
Bomb guidance malfunction.
We hit the Russian position.

13:52.077 --> 13:54.812
Oh, my God.

13:58.924 --> 14:00.692
Al-Qaeda posted it two hours ago.

14:00.693 --> 14:02.361
It's already been picked up by thousands

14:02.362 --> 14:03.895
of Russian Web sites.

14:03.896 --> 14:05.130
The narrator is saying

14:05.131 --> 14:07.833
that we deliberately
attacked Russian soldiers.

14:07.834 --> 14:10.847
I'm guessing my formal apology to Russia

14:10.848 --> 14:12.849
isn't getting as much play.

14:12.850 --> 14:15.585
Avdonin isn't returning my calls.

14:15.586 --> 14:19.255
We leave for G20 tonight.

14:19.256 --> 14:20.924
Anything on the pathogen?

14:20.925 --> 14:23.100
Dr. Warner brightened my day with word

14:23.101 --> 14:25.068
that preliminary analysis has it

14:25.069 --> 14:27.137
at Ebola lethality, but airborne,

14:27.138 --> 14:30.340
making it far more transmissible.

14:30.341 --> 14:33.477
Excuse me, sir. Director
Ware and Oliver Shaw.

14:33.478 --> 14:35.245
Welcome back, Oliver.

14:35.246 --> 14:36.580
Uh, thank you, Mr. President.

14:36.581 --> 14:38.548
It turns out Silicon Valley
didn't have the excitement

14:38.549 --> 14:40.182
of a weaponized drone threat.

14:41.485 --> 14:43.387
Not that I'm enjoying this.

14:43.388 --> 14:44.721
What's the latest?

14:44.722 --> 14:47.457
Yes. Captain Baker and
I developed an exploit

14:47.458 --> 14:48.759
to control the drone remotely,

14:48.760 --> 14:50.927
but we need to be
within the signal radius

14:50.928 --> 14:53.063
of the drone's transceiver,
which is about 300 miles.

14:53.064 --> 14:55.732
We just completed a search of
Israel and its border areas.

14:55.733 --> 14:56.967
It's not there.

14:56.968 --> 15:00.237
So, Al-Qaeda's regrouping,

15:00.238 --> 15:02.406
preparing to make another run at it?

15:02.407 --> 15:04.207
Or they picked a new target.

15:04.208 --> 15:06.243
I'm leaning toward option two.

15:06.244 --> 15:08.879
Interpol got a hit on
one of the fingerprints

15:08.880 --> 15:10.180
dusted in the Syrian lab.

15:10.181 --> 15:11.948
An Al-Qaeda foot soldier

15:11.949 --> 15:15.152
who was confronted by the
local authorities in Istanbul

15:15.153 --> 15:16.420
- this morning.
- Okay, now we're talking.

15:16.421 --> 15:17.854
We gonna get a crack at him?

15:17.855 --> 15:19.723
He's dead. Resisted arrest.

15:19.724 --> 15:21.958
But they found 50,000
Euros in his suitcase.

15:21.959 --> 15:25.996
So they're planning
something in an EU country?

15:25.997 --> 15:27.831
Well, that narrows it down.

15:27.832 --> 15:29.599
To a continent.

15:29.600 --> 15:31.168
On the Jerusalem front,

15:31.169 --> 15:33.003
looks like Reverend
Slattery is gonna make it.

15:33.004 --> 15:37.441
Dr. McCord and Agent Maloof will
interview him when he comes to.

15:37.442 --> 15:40.177
Adele, get me President Hoffmeier

15:40.178 --> 15:43.013
or any member of the European
Council who's available, now.

15:43.014 --> 15:44.847
You, my office.

15:46.316 --> 15:48.719
You are having lunch tomorrow

15:48.720 --> 15:52.856
with Tony Angilillo, Harvard
Law's admissions director.

15:52.857 --> 15:55.025
Uh, yeah, I-I know who that is.

15:55.026 --> 15:57.260
Um, I thought... I thought I told you...

15:57.261 --> 15:59.229
Yeah, to stand down.

15:59.230 --> 16:01.198
What can I say? I'm a giver.

16:01.199 --> 16:04.034
How can... how can you even

16:04.035 --> 16:06.536
remotely care about
my law school prospects

16:06.537 --> 16:08.872
with everything going on?

16:08.873 --> 16:12.609
That is an excellent
question, Stephanie McCord.

16:12.610 --> 16:15.345
Actually reminds me of a conversation

16:15.346 --> 16:18.448
I had with my mother
during Nixon's final days

16:18.449 --> 16:20.617
when it looked like all hope was lost

16:20.618 --> 16:22.052
for our shining democracy.

16:22.053 --> 16:25.522
I asked her, "Why should I
give a crap about anything

16:25.523 --> 16:27.457
when everything seems so bleak?"

16:27.458 --> 16:31.094
And she said, "Don't worry.
It's never as bad as you think?"

16:31.095 --> 16:32.796
Oh, no, she said, "It's always much worse

16:32.797 --> 16:34.030
than you can imagine."

16:34.031 --> 16:37.567
But, that we might just
get out of it one day.

16:37.568 --> 16:40.670
And if we did, I wouldn't get back

16:40.671 --> 16:44.007
all the time I'd squandered
not giving a crap.

16:44.008 --> 16:47.644
And that is the day I learned
how to compartmentalize.

16:47.645 --> 16:49.112
I have President Hoffmeier.

16:49.113 --> 16:51.515
- Put her through.
- You want to go to Harvard Law?

16:51.516 --> 16:52.949
- Of course.
- So take the meeting.

16:52.950 --> 16:55.885
Be smart and respectful.
Make something of yourself.

16:58.155 --> 17:00.357
President Hoffmeier.

17:00.358 --> 17:03.493
Yeah, I'm afraid I have,
uh, some troubling news

17:03.494 --> 17:05.928
regarding a biological weapon.

17:06.930 --> 17:09.633
More Intel from
Al-Qaeda-in-Syria suggests

17:09.634 --> 17:12.769
target of attack will
be "Rayiys alkuffar."

17:12.770 --> 17:15.372
Head of the infidels.

17:15.373 --> 17:19.175
Head of the infidels.

17:20.578 --> 17:23.079
Reverend Slattery, my
name is Henry, this is Mo.

17:23.079 --> 17:26.616
We'd like to talk with you for a minute.

17:26.617 --> 17:28.618
You a Muslim?

17:28.619 --> 17:30.787
Yes, I am.

17:30.788 --> 17:33.223
Get the hell out.

17:33.224 --> 17:36.159
Well, that's an interesting reaction,

17:36.160 --> 17:38.728
especially considering you were willing

17:38.729 --> 17:40.397
to partner with Al-Qaeda-in-Syria.

17:40.398 --> 17:43.533
I was doing God's will, that's all.

17:43.534 --> 17:45.035
You know, I envy you.

17:45.036 --> 17:48.905
I don't think I've ever felt
that, faith without doubt.

17:48.906 --> 17:50.207
What's that like?

17:50.208 --> 17:53.176
You don't have the light,
I can't explain it to you,

17:53.177 --> 17:55.444
I'll pray for you, brother.

17:56.179 --> 17:58.648
You know...

17:58.649 --> 18:00.884
I spoke with your
predecessor, Reverend Finch,

18:00.885 --> 18:03.820
at the Covenant of
John compound in Bolivia

18:03.821 --> 18:05.555
a couple of years ago.

18:05.556 --> 18:08.123
He had that same certainty.

18:09.626 --> 18:14.464
This is from that day, after the raid.

18:14.465 --> 18:17.634
The poison worked quickly.

18:17.635 --> 18:20.803
37 people took their lives.

18:22.305 --> 18:27.210
As was foretold, the
six-eyed beast did rise.

18:27.211 --> 18:29.179
And what about the Al-Qaeda members

18:29.180 --> 18:30.847
who gunned down your brothers?

18:30.848 --> 18:32.449
Was that a different beast?

18:32.450 --> 18:33.950
No. That was...

18:33.951 --> 18:36.152
The Antichrist comes in
the perfect appearance

18:36.153 --> 18:38.054
of righteousness.

18:38.055 --> 18:40.423
Is it possible you were
fooled by the Antichrist?

18:40.424 --> 18:42.525
Was Reverend Finch fooled by me?

18:42.526 --> 18:43.827
Was I the Antichrist?

18:43.828 --> 18:45.962
Could there be two? A dozen?

18:45.963 --> 18:47.330
In the Book of Revelation...

18:47.331 --> 18:48.932
I know what it says.

18:48.933 --> 18:51.468
Everything's happening
according to God's plan.

18:51.469 --> 18:53.737
Your doctor said

18:53.738 --> 18:56.106
that the bullet that
blew through your chest

18:56.107 --> 18:57.874
missed your heart by a millimeter.

18:57.875 --> 19:00.744
I believe God's grace can
be one millimeter wide.

19:00.745 --> 19:03.980
And I think you were saved to
bring salvation to the world.

19:03.981 --> 19:05.849
You, Andrew.

19:05.850 --> 19:08.752
And now, the righteous
arrows of your group...

19:08.753 --> 19:11.788
the drone, the dreadful disease
you planned to unleash...

19:11.789 --> 19:14.090
all of it has been
taken by the Antichrist,

19:14.091 --> 19:16.092
and it's up to you to stop them.

19:16.093 --> 19:19.296
You, Andrew, only you, can be
the instrument of His peace.

19:19.297 --> 19:22.398
Only you can save
millions of His faithful.

19:26.837 --> 19:28.705
Reverend?

19:28.706 --> 19:30.607
Rev?

19:30.608 --> 19:32.674
You had me going.

19:46.222 --> 19:50.327
Any, uh, word back from Avdonin's office?

19:50.328 --> 19:53.463
Still radio silence, ma'am.

19:53.464 --> 19:55.465
Well, I'm sure it won't be awkward

19:55.466 --> 19:58.267
when we run into each other
at the chocolate fountain.

20:03.039 --> 20:05.942
Got to love Rome.

20:05.943 --> 20:08.144
Ooh. I'm... think I'm gonna be sick.

20:08.145 --> 20:10.180
What? Make way for the pregnant lady.

20:10.181 --> 20:12.748
Permesso!

20:14.517 --> 20:17.087
The secretary and Jay are
off meeting with the governor

20:17.088 --> 20:20.156
of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority,

20:20.157 --> 20:22.892
so, Daisy is, um...

20:22.893 --> 20:24.961
Puking her guts out in the ladies?

20:24.962 --> 20:26.363
Strong start.

20:26.364 --> 20:29.332
Blake Moran. Get out.

20:29.333 --> 20:32.135
Trevor, what are you doing here?

20:32.136 --> 20:34.938
Oh, B&W's giving a few, uh,
banking privacy presentations.

20:34.939 --> 20:37.440
- Oh.
- It's on the official agenda.

20:37.441 --> 20:38.975
Yeah, I must've missed that.

20:38.976 --> 20:42.445
Well, uh, are you gonna
introduce me to your friends?

20:42.446 --> 20:43.913
Sorry. Uh, this is Nadine Tolliver,

20:43.914 --> 20:45.315
Secretary McCord's chief of staff.

20:45.316 --> 20:46.516
How do you do?

20:46.517 --> 20:47.817
And Matt Mahoney,

20:47.818 --> 20:48.885
head speechwriter.

20:48.886 --> 20:50.120
- Hey, man.
- Nice to meet you.

20:50.121 --> 20:52.188
Trevor Kingston.

20:52.189 --> 20:54.024
Uh, Trevor and I worked together

20:54.025 --> 20:56.126
at Baldwin and Wilder
right out of college.

20:56.127 --> 20:57.494
More like pillaged together.

20:57.495 --> 20:59.496
And you left a lot of money on the table.

20:59.497 --> 21:01.765
Well, got to hang on to my soul.

21:01.766 --> 21:03.666
Oh, gosh, I didn't realize I lost mine.

21:03.667 --> 21:05.568
I guess I was too busy driving the engine

21:05.569 --> 21:06.803
of the American economy.

21:06.804 --> 21:08.471
Well, and I was too busy
bolstering global democracy

21:08.472 --> 21:09.773
so you'd have stable markets to exploit.

21:09.774 --> 21:11.441
As the secretary of state's assistant.

21:11.442 --> 21:16.780
Actually, Trevor, Blake
is the executive assistant

21:16.781 --> 21:18.214
to the secretary of state.

21:18.215 --> 21:19.682
He's her point man.

21:19.683 --> 21:21.317
Well, I guess you could say

21:21.318 --> 21:25.655
he's the, uh, gatekeeper
for American diplomacy.

21:25.656 --> 21:28.224
My bad.

21:28.225 --> 21:29.659
It's great to see you, man.

21:29.660 --> 21:32.629
And-and lovely to meet you both.

21:32.630 --> 21:34.464
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

21:34.465 --> 21:38.134
Handsome really does come with
its own free pass, doesn't it?

21:39.470 --> 21:41.436
Thanks.

21:48.846 --> 21:51.514
Their eyes light up when
you rock the Arabic, ma'am.

21:51.515 --> 21:53.550
Well, too bad I don't speak Russian.

21:53.551 --> 21:56.152
I'll reach out to them
again. Do svidanya.

21:57.421 --> 21:59.155
Hi, sweetie.

21:59.156 --> 22:02.058
Hey, Mom. Uh, sorry to bother you,

22:02.059 --> 22:03.993
but I'm just curious if you have any idea

22:03.994 --> 22:05.795
why Russell Jackson is suddenly back

22:05.796 --> 22:07.230
to knocking heads at Harvard?

22:07.231 --> 22:11.034
He's knocking heads, huh?

22:11.035 --> 22:14.137
That's not a rhetorical
stalling tactic, is it?

22:14.138 --> 22:16.271
Excuse me?

22:17.040 --> 22:19.209
Oh, my God, Mom.

22:19.210 --> 22:21.243
You put him up to it, didn't you?

22:21.978 --> 22:24.314
You're a wild mustang.

22:24.315 --> 22:25.515
What?

22:25.516 --> 22:29.185
You-you should be free and fly and...

22:29.186 --> 22:30.353
I'm Pegasus?

22:30.354 --> 22:31.654
So I'm a flying horse?

22:31.655 --> 22:34.991
Is that actually your excuse
for meddling in my life?

22:34.992 --> 22:36.626
I just want you to be happy.

22:36.627 --> 22:38.161
I...

22:38.162 --> 22:41.865
I'm sorry. I-I shouldn't
have gone behind your back,

22:41.866 --> 22:44.367
and I shouldn't meddle in your life.

22:44.368 --> 22:47.036
And... I'll work on it.

22:47.037 --> 22:48.671
Please do.

22:48.672 --> 22:50.607
How are your charges?

22:50.608 --> 22:53.977
Um, well, I've managed
to contain the chaos

22:53.978 --> 22:57.013
to dirty dishes and
unmonitored social media.

22:57.014 --> 22:58.214
Hey, I'm, uh,

22:58.215 --> 22:59.916
thinking of staying
home from school, so...

22:59.917 --> 23:03.153
Yeah, if you can walk
and talk, you're going.

23:03.154 --> 23:05.989
Oh... well done.

23:05.990 --> 23:08.791
That was good. That was really good.

23:08.792 --> 23:10.994
Deprogramming a cult member

23:10.995 --> 23:14.130
requires exposing him to
flaws in the cult's pedagogy

23:14.131 --> 23:15.665
and, ultimately, the leader himself.

23:15.666 --> 23:17.600
Yeah, but Slattery is the leader.

23:17.601 --> 23:19.202
And he's too arrogant to admit

23:19.203 --> 23:21.271
any of his shortcomings in his beliefs.

23:21.272 --> 23:24.340
He was willing to send
Ian to be a suicide bomber,

23:24.341 --> 23:26.142
but I doubt he'd sacrifice himself.

23:26.143 --> 23:28.144
Like bin Laden holed up in a cave

23:28.145 --> 23:29.812
while sending his minions to die.

23:29.813 --> 23:32.849
It's all about self-preservation.

23:36.319 --> 23:38.288
- Hello?
- Hello. Stephanie McCord?

23:38.289 --> 23:39.956
Uh, yes, this is she.

23:39.957 --> 23:42.625
This is Ms. Morales, Monroe High's nurse.

23:42.626 --> 23:44.260
Jason complained of
stomach pain and then...

23:44.261 --> 23:46.396
- I puked in gym class!
- Did you get that?

23:46.397 --> 23:49.399
Uh, yeah, loud and clear. But he's okay?

23:49.400 --> 23:50.867
Well, he has a mild fever

23:50.868 --> 23:53.703
and due to the location
of the abdominal pain,

23:53.704 --> 23:56.206
I can't rule out appendicitis,
so we'll have to take him

23:56.207 --> 23:58.074
to St. Lucius and get a CT scan.

23:58.075 --> 24:00.977
And if the scan shows
that it's appendicitis?

24:00.978 --> 24:03.213
He'll need emergency surgery.

24:03.214 --> 24:05.915
Oh. Wow.

24:05.916 --> 24:07.116
Hey!

24:07.117 --> 24:10.218
If I don't make it,
clear my search history.

24:16.526 --> 24:18.561
Sh...

24:23.399 --> 24:26.369
Reverend, I never should
have doubted your beliefs.

24:26.370 --> 24:28.471
Clearly, they're strong.

24:28.472 --> 24:32.642
I'm but a vessel of the
Lord. He is my strength.

24:32.643 --> 24:35.211
Well, you're gonna need all of
His strength where you're going.

24:35.212 --> 24:38.248
ADX Florence, Colorado Supermax.

24:38.249 --> 24:42.452
23 hours a day in a 12 by seven cell.

24:42.453 --> 24:45.121
The only way out is in a box.

24:45.122 --> 24:47.323
That's in the Lord's hands.

24:47.324 --> 24:49.959
Well, more like the Justice Department.

24:49.960 --> 24:54.230
But if you work with us,
we can recommend a Club Fed.

24:54.231 --> 24:55.431
Minimum security,

24:55.432 --> 24:58.467
but you have to start talking now.

25:03.273 --> 25:06.943
When they spoke among themselves,

25:06.944 --> 25:08.678
it was mostly in Arabic.

25:08.679 --> 25:11.414
But sometimes they'd
speak in broken English.

25:11.415 --> 25:12.949
What did they say?

25:12.950 --> 25:14.984
Right before we went into the tunnel,

25:14.985 --> 25:20.089
Ramjin told Hamid something
about a fee for a room.

25:20.090 --> 25:21.524
Like a hotel room?

25:21.525 --> 25:23.993
That's all I heard.

25:23.994 --> 25:26.595
"Fee for room."

25:30.166 --> 25:33.102
I don't think they're
speaking in broken English.

25:33.103 --> 25:34.370
What do you mean?

25:34.371 --> 25:36.472
"Room" in Arabic is "Rome."

25:36.473 --> 25:38.408
"Fee" is "in."

25:38.409 --> 25:40.009
Fee Ar-Room,

25:40.010 --> 25:42.477
it means "in Rome."

25:48.519 --> 25:51.220
Are we in touch with
Italian Armed Forces?

25:51.221 --> 25:53.356
We're establishing a link with
Defense Minister Bellucci now.

25:53.357 --> 25:55.158
Any sign of the drone?

25:55.159 --> 25:57.327
It was just spotted
over Ferentino, 40 miles

25:57.328 --> 26:00.463
southeast of us, heading
for Municipio VII.

26:00.464 --> 26:02.765
It's a straight shot to Vatican City.

26:02.766 --> 26:04.267
Ever since its inception,

26:04.268 --> 26:07.803
Al-Qaeda's been trying to even
the score for the Crusades.

26:08.571 --> 26:09.872
They're after the Pope?

26:09.873 --> 26:11.573
Head of the infidels.

26:21.907 --> 26:23.842
We have the Sit Room, Mr. President.

26:23.843 --> 26:25.177
Oliver,

26:25.178 --> 26:27.479
now that we know where the drone is,

26:27.480 --> 26:29.615
- can't you take control of it?
- An F-35

26:29.616 --> 26:31.350
should have the transmitter
in range in just a minute, sir.

26:31.351 --> 26:33.485
That's cutting it a little close.

26:33.486 --> 26:34.920
We have Minister Bellucci.

26:34.921 --> 26:38.357
Mr. President, our jets
are almost in position

26:38.358 --> 26:39.658
to shoot down the drone.

26:39.659 --> 26:40.726
Minister Bellucci,

26:40.727 --> 26:43.061
it's Elizabeth McCord here.

26:43.062 --> 26:44.830
We have reason to believe

26:44.831 --> 26:47.766
that there could be a biological weapon

26:47.767 --> 26:50.235
on the drone; if you hit
it over a populated area,

26:50.236 --> 26:53.105
you run the risk of causing a pandemic.

26:53.106 --> 26:55.774
We're very close to being able
to take control of the drone,

26:55.775 --> 26:58.275
- Minister.
- We cannot wait much longer.

27:00.178 --> 27:01.079
Oliver?

27:01.080 --> 27:02.681
Trying to engage now, sir.

27:02.682 --> 27:04.783
One minute till contact

27:04.784 --> 27:06.951
with the Vatican.

27:14.459 --> 27:17.194
We are out of time, President Dalton.

27:19.231 --> 27:21.033
- Engaged!
- I have control of the drone.

27:21.034 --> 27:22.299
We have control of the drone.

27:22.356 --> 27:23.416
_

27:23.876 --> 27:25.086
_

27:29.308 --> 27:32.042
It's a miss. They were able to abort.

27:33.245 --> 27:35.247
I don't have control of
the landing mechanism,

27:35.248 --> 27:37.581
so it'll have to be a managed
crash away from the city.

27:48.694 --> 27:50.696
We will coordinate containment

27:50.697 --> 27:53.531
with your Biological Response Force.

27:55.500 --> 27:56.935
I told the school

27:56.936 --> 27:58.570
not to bother you. He's fine.

27:58.571 --> 28:00.439
I got the update on the way over here.

28:00.440 --> 28:02.307
- Hey. I'm on with Dad.
- Hey.

28:02.308 --> 28:03.408
Hey, Dad.

28:03.409 --> 28:06.343
He looks okay. How you doing?

28:07.079 --> 28:08.613
I got a thumbs-up.

28:08.614 --> 28:11.383
Uh, they did a CT scan
and ruled out appendicitis.

28:11.384 --> 28:13.585
He wants to talk to you.

28:13.586 --> 28:15.187
Hey.

28:15.188 --> 28:17.589
It was, uh, much ado about barfing.

28:17.590 --> 28:19.624
Oh, my God.

28:19.625 --> 28:21.093
What's with the bombing? Is Mom okay?

28:21.094 --> 28:23.328
It was a minor incident
just outside Rome.

28:23.329 --> 28:26.631
- How do you even know about it?
- It's breaking news right now.

28:26.632 --> 28:28.333
Because I work for the government.

28:28.334 --> 28:29.701
Everyone there is fine.

28:29.702 --> 28:30.769
You talked to Mom?

28:30.770 --> 28:32.204
I was just about to call her.

28:32.205 --> 28:34.039
I'll conference her in. Hang on.

28:34.040 --> 28:35.340
He said she's fine.

28:35.341 --> 28:37.943
Hey, Stevie, I was
just about to call you.

28:37.944 --> 28:39.945
I got the message about Jason.

28:39.946 --> 28:41.780
I told them not to call you guys.

28:41.781 --> 28:43.882
He's fine. It was a...
it was a false alarm.

28:43.883 --> 28:47.119
Um, what is this about
a-a terrorist attack?

28:47.120 --> 28:48.086
Dad's on the line,

28:48.087 --> 28:49.454
- by the way.
- Hi, babe.

28:49.455 --> 28:51.790
Oh, hey. Party line.

28:51.791 --> 28:54.626
How's, uh... how's London?

28:54.627 --> 28:55.861
Surprisingly sunny.

28:55.862 --> 28:56.895
Guys,

28:56.896 --> 28:58.196
headline.

28:58.197 --> 28:59.731
Oh, nothing. It was a...

28:59.732 --> 29:01.967
thwarted attempt at some
kind of drone attack.

29:01.968 --> 29:03.635
But, come on, I am dying to hear.

29:03.636 --> 29:05.937
The Harvard meeting, how did it go?

29:05.938 --> 29:07.572
Yeah, I had to skip it

29:07.573 --> 29:09.207
so that I could get to the hospital.

29:09.208 --> 29:10.842
Oh, Stevie, I'm...

29:10.843 --> 29:13.745
I'm so sorry.

29:13.746 --> 29:16.448
We should've been there.
We should've been there.

29:16.449 --> 29:17.916
- Mm.
- Can we just focus

29:17.917 --> 29:19.885
on the fact that Rome is not burning,

29:19.886 --> 29:24.089
Jason is fine, and our daughter
is an incredibly good person?

29:24.090 --> 29:25.157
Fine.

29:25.158 --> 29:27.458
Dork.

29:29.561 --> 29:31.930
Any inside word on the next drone attack?

29:31.931 --> 29:35.499
I think we're safe for the moment.

29:40.839 --> 29:42.441
He'll have a Manhattan.

29:42.442 --> 29:44.593
Bulleit if you have it,
Maker's if you don't.

29:44.594 --> 29:45.911
Yes, sir. Right away.

29:45.912 --> 29:48.914
See? You can be nice.

29:48.915 --> 29:51.817
I figure you haven't changed,
why should your drink?

29:51.818 --> 29:53.518
Well, I could say the same.

29:53.519 --> 29:56.655
You're still in the closet, I see.

29:56.656 --> 29:57.789
Wow.

29:57.790 --> 29:59.324
No "how you been, how's the family?"

29:59.325 --> 30:00.792
How's the family and...

30:00.793 --> 30:03.894
why so reluctant to introduce
me to your coworkers?

30:06.164 --> 30:09.367
My mom is exactly the same,
my sister has two kids,

30:09.368 --> 30:11.736
and I don't need to
explain to my coworkers

30:11.737 --> 30:13.438
that we...

30:13.439 --> 30:16.074
dated for a few months seven years ago.

30:16.075 --> 30:18.777
"A few months"?

30:18.778 --> 30:20.911
Eight or nine months.

30:22.347 --> 30:25.549
So, what about your sister's kids?

30:28.253 --> 30:30.355
Mia and Teddy.

30:30.356 --> 30:33.624
Straight out of a Pottery
Barn catalog. You'd love 'em.

30:34.826 --> 30:38.129
Do they know about Uncle
Blake and his special friends?

30:38.130 --> 30:40.532
What? Come on. We're catching up.

30:40.533 --> 30:43.935
My family knows me and understands me.

30:43.936 --> 30:45.704
At work, I choose to be more private.

30:45.705 --> 30:47.672
Is that okay with you?

30:47.673 --> 30:49.941
If you're happy, I'm happy.

30:49.942 --> 30:52.843
- Well, good. Thank you.
- Thanks.

30:53.912 --> 30:55.881
Then again, it's not like you're working

30:55.882 --> 30:57.716
with a bunch of homophobic
frat boys anymore,

30:57.717 --> 31:01.218
so I don't really get why you
can't just own that you're gay.

31:03.321 --> 31:07.125
Oh, Blake, you're not
still on that bi thing.

31:07.126 --> 31:09.094
It's not a thing I'm on.

31:09.095 --> 31:10.629
It's who I am.

31:10.630 --> 31:12.631
Fine, fine. I'm not an econ wonk.

31:12.632 --> 31:14.866
I just have an ass
tattoo of Alan Greenspan.

31:14.867 --> 31:17.903
That. That. That is
why I don't tell people.

31:17.904 --> 31:19.437
It leads to these inane discussions

31:19.438 --> 31:21.540
about the-the current
acceptable terminology.

31:21.541 --> 31:23.096
And it's none of your business.

31:23.097 --> 31:24.523
So what happens when they find out?

31:24.524 --> 31:25.870
You quit and run away again?

31:25.871 --> 31:27.345
Oh, you're living your perfect life?

31:27.346 --> 31:29.880
How's that music program
for inner city kids going?

31:32.884 --> 31:34.052
Damn it.

31:34.053 --> 31:36.087
- No, that was good.
- I'm sorry.

31:36.088 --> 31:37.888
You got good aim.

31:41.893 --> 31:45.897
I'm not done getting where I'm going.

31:45.898 --> 31:48.066
It's a journey.

31:48.067 --> 31:50.200
Isn't that what you used to say?

31:51.970 --> 31:53.338
Oh... oh, I hope not.

31:53.339 --> 31:56.040
That-that sounds really trite.

32:01.179 --> 32:03.548
I just want you to be happy.

32:03.549 --> 32:07.052
And I want people to really know you.

32:07.053 --> 32:10.288
I'm lucky I got to.

32:10.289 --> 32:12.690
Seems like there aren't very many of us.

32:14.426 --> 32:16.360
See? You can be nice.

32:17.596 --> 32:19.965
I'm glad to see you're doing well.

32:19.966 --> 32:21.566
Take care of yourself, bro.

32:21.567 --> 32:22.901
"Bro"?

32:22.902 --> 32:24.336
- I know. Ugh.
- Don't use "bro."

32:24.337 --> 32:25.770
- I know. I tried it. I just...
- Never.

32:25.771 --> 32:27.606
- I hate it.
- Don't ever say that.

32:27.607 --> 32:29.707
When in Rome, right?

32:32.477 --> 32:34.079
This week was marred

32:34.080 --> 32:37.415
by the loss of 22 brave Russian soldiers.

32:37.416 --> 32:41.152
I have expressed my deepest
sympathy to our Russian friends,

32:41.153 --> 32:43.421
but also my profound gratitude.

32:43.422 --> 32:46.124
Because the intelligence
gathered on that very mission

32:46.125 --> 32:48.660
helped prevent what might
have been a devastating attack

32:48.661 --> 32:50.294
right here in Rome.

32:51.997 --> 32:53.898
Think about that.

32:53.899 --> 32:57.402
Russians and Americans working together

32:57.403 --> 33:00.572
in Syria, to stop an attack in Italy.

33:00.573 --> 33:02.774
As if we need any more evidence

33:02.775 --> 33:06.678
that the world is too
dangerous to go it alone.

33:06.679 --> 33:08.213
Tonight,

33:08.214 --> 33:10.649
we remember the fallen,

33:10.650 --> 33:13.284
while staying focused
on thwarting terrorists

33:13.285 --> 33:16.588
using any means possible.

33:16.589 --> 33:18.956
Here's to our success.

33:25.063 --> 33:26.998
Even Salnikov raised his glass.

33:26.999 --> 33:28.533
You are good, sir.

33:28.534 --> 33:31.136
I worked with two speechwriters

33:31.137 --> 33:33.872
and practiced in front
of a mirror for an hour.

33:33.873 --> 33:35.740
Mr. President, ma'am.

33:35.741 --> 33:37.909
We just got word from our
Biological Response Force.

33:37.910 --> 33:39.811
They didn't find any virus

33:39.812 --> 33:41.279
at the drone crash site.

33:41.280 --> 33:43.147
It wasn't armed with a bio-weapon?

33:44.082 --> 33:46.016
It was a head fake.

33:48.253 --> 33:51.690
"Head of the infidels."

33:51.691 --> 33:53.625
It's you, sir...

33:53.626 --> 33:56.860
and the other leaders.

33:58.296 --> 34:00.364
We have to evacuate now.

34:04.612 --> 34:05.847
This way.

34:05.848 --> 34:07.015
Where's the team?

34:07.016 --> 34:08.149
Everybody out.

34:08.150 --> 34:09.751
Wait, wait, wait.

34:09.752 --> 34:11.686
Tell security that this bio-weapon

34:11.687 --> 34:13.353
could be aerosolized, but in any case,

34:13.355 --> 34:15.004
they have to shut down
the HVAC system, okay?

34:15.005 --> 34:15.523
Okay.

34:15.524 --> 34:17.025
And then, Jay,

34:17.025 --> 34:19.560
- get the hell out.
- Yes, ma'am.

34:27.902 --> 34:29.643
_

34:29.873 --> 34:30.572
_

35:27.260 --> 35:28.185
_

35:28.536 --> 35:29.671
_

35:30.006 --> 35:30.705
_

35:30.765 --> 35:32.083
_

35:55.089 --> 35:56.357
Hi. Um, is my mom okay?

35:56.358 --> 35:57.859
I just talked to her, like, an hour ago.

35:57.860 --> 35:59.360
Yeah, she's fine.

35:59.361 --> 36:01.996
The only casualties were
the two Al-Qaeda militants

36:01.997 --> 36:03.431
who released the pathogen.

36:03.432 --> 36:05.166
Got sick themselves,

36:05.167 --> 36:08.402
which is poetic justice
if ever I've heard it.

36:08.403 --> 36:11.139
Okay. Then, um...

36:11.140 --> 36:13.307
to what do I owe the pleasure?

36:13.308 --> 36:15.409
I'm taking you to breakfast.

36:15.410 --> 36:17.545
Are you promoting me?

36:17.546 --> 36:19.280
No, better.

36:19.281 --> 36:22.257
I was able to reschedule
a meeting with Angilillo,

36:22.258 --> 36:25.317
and this time I'm personally
making sure you get there.

36:25.318 --> 36:28.654
It's in 20 minutes, downtown.

36:28.655 --> 36:29.954
Wow.

36:31.657 --> 36:33.192
Did you not hear me say 20 minutes?

36:33.193 --> 36:34.727
Sorry. No, Th... yeah. That's very,

36:34.728 --> 36:36.195
just really nice of you.

36:36.196 --> 36:40.099
Um, I mean, even if my mother
tiger-mom'd you into it.

36:40.100 --> 36:44.569
Well, this time it's not for your mother.

36:45.337 --> 36:46.705
You've proven yourself

36:46.706 --> 36:49.008
to have more character and integrity

36:49.009 --> 36:52.978
than 99% of the pampered,
gelatinous blue bloods

36:52.979 --> 36:57.149
who skulk through the
halls of Harvard Law.

36:57.150 --> 36:59.385
So... go get ready.

36:59.386 --> 37:01.654
I'll be in the car.

37:01.655 --> 37:03.289
You know what?

37:03.290 --> 37:06.058
I, um, just realized something.

37:06.059 --> 37:07.859
Uh...

37:10.496 --> 37:13.032
I don't want to go.

37:13.033 --> 37:16.134
Why the hell not?

37:18.337 --> 37:22.107
I mean, um, I don't
want to go to Harvard,

37:22.108 --> 37:24.677
or any law school.

37:24.678 --> 37:27.046
I just, it's... if I go,

37:27.047 --> 37:29.315
I'm gonna be ditching the opportunity

37:29.316 --> 37:32.585
to-to help my family while Mom is still

37:32.586 --> 37:34.720
one of the most powerful
people on the planet,

37:34.721 --> 37:36.856
and Dad is working the War College

37:36.857 --> 37:38.891
and doing all this other secrety stuff

37:38.892 --> 37:43.028
that I know he does and...

37:43.029 --> 37:45.164
they need me.

37:45.165 --> 37:47.433
And at-at the risk
of being presumptuous,

37:47.434 --> 37:49.502
I think you need me.

37:49.503 --> 37:51.904
Yeah, that's presumptuous.

37:51.905 --> 37:55.174
Okay. Well, I mean,
maybe then, I need you,

37:55.175 --> 37:57.910
or, um...

37:57.911 --> 38:02.548
I need to be doing
work that matters today.

38:02.549 --> 38:04.216
Law school can wait.

38:04.217 --> 38:06.118
I mean, service

38:06.119 --> 38:08.254
is-is the family business,

38:08.255 --> 38:10.656
kind of, I guess.

38:10.657 --> 38:14.593
And, um...

38:14.594 --> 38:17.428
I'm happy where I am.

38:19.298 --> 38:24.035
And you just realized all this?

38:25.070 --> 38:26.305
Uh...

38:30.843 --> 38:32.744
McCords.

38:42.755 --> 38:44.590
Well, I guess that's
the end of the movie.

38:44.591 --> 38:46.258
We had front row seats

38:46.259 --> 38:47.793
to all the ugliness done

38:47.794 --> 38:49.495
in the name of our religions.

38:49.496 --> 38:51.763
So, that was fun.

38:53.832 --> 38:55.834
Look, for what it's worth,

38:55.835 --> 38:58.671
I struggle with my faith, too.

38:58.672 --> 39:00.739
I constantly want to feel closer to God.

39:00.740 --> 39:03.175
I feel like it's right there,

39:03.176 --> 39:05.778
but there's a barrier.

39:05.779 --> 39:09.081
Maybe it's everything
we face with our work

39:09.082 --> 39:11.684
making me doubt, making me angry,

39:11.685 --> 39:13.953
but I still think I'll get there.

39:13.954 --> 39:17.723
Tomorrow, next week.

39:17.724 --> 39:21.627
But the years keep going by.

39:21.628 --> 39:25.698
Maybe that feeling, that yearning,

39:25.699 --> 39:28.934
maybe that's all there is.

39:28.935 --> 39:31.335
Maybe that's enough.

39:33.238 --> 39:36.107
Maybe.

39:38.978 --> 39:40.412
Pleasure.

39:40.413 --> 39:42.647
So long, Mo.

39:46.852 --> 39:48.320
Thanks for dropping me off first, ma'am.

39:48.321 --> 39:49.555
It's totally unnecessary.

39:49.556 --> 39:53.057
No problem, dude. It was on the way.

39:55.327 --> 39:57.596
I still can't really
pull off "dude," can I?

39:57.597 --> 39:58.731
No, ma'am.

39:58.732 --> 40:01.266
I'm gonna work on it.

40:01.267 --> 40:03.002
I'm sure you'll get there.

40:03.003 --> 40:04.236
Good night, Madam Secretary.

40:04.237 --> 40:06.204
Good night.

40:09.108 --> 40:11.610
Ma'am, I'm bi.

40:11.611 --> 40:14.078
Yeah. Bye. I'll see you in the morning.

40:21.820 --> 40:23.155
Wait.

40:23.156 --> 40:24.690
Ma'am.

40:24.691 --> 40:26.592
Ma'am?

40:26.593 --> 40:28.526
Ma'am.

40:29.962 --> 40:31.497
What? Did you forget something?

40:31.498 --> 40:33.165
No, I'm bi, ma'am.

40:33.166 --> 40:35.533
Bisexual.

40:36.802 --> 40:38.103
I know. You're probably like,

40:38.104 --> 40:39.905
"What? Why is he telling me this now?"

40:39.906 --> 40:41.507
And I can't say for certain, um,

40:41.508 --> 40:43.575
but it definitely has to
do with an old boyfriend

40:43.576 --> 40:45.911
who can be kind of a jerk,
but makes good points.

40:45.912 --> 40:47.279
One of them is about

40:47.280 --> 40:48.881
what I always considered
my right to privacy,

40:48.882 --> 40:50.416
which, of course, I still believe in.

40:50.417 --> 40:52.117
It's in the Constitution, for God's sake.

40:52.118 --> 40:54.019
But, um, I realize
now my right to privacy

40:54.020 --> 40:55.654
is different than me
choosing to be private

40:55.655 --> 40:57.523
and really has more to
do with trusting people

40:57.524 --> 40:59.958
with my private business,
which is hard for me,

40:59.959 --> 41:02.661
because I've experienced
a lot of weird bi-phobia

41:02.662 --> 41:04.463
from everyone... I mean,
straight people, gay people.

41:04.464 --> 41:06.031
Not that I think that you're bi-phobic

41:06.032 --> 41:07.866
or homophobic or phobic about anything.

41:07.867 --> 41:11.070
It's just, I've gotten used to
keeping people at arm's length,

41:11.071 --> 41:13.038
because, uh, I'm not dumb.

41:13.039 --> 41:14.773
I know people are confused by me,

41:14.774 --> 41:16.075
or-or curious, and that's fine.

41:16.076 --> 41:17.609
I've just, I've never felt the obligation

41:17.610 --> 41:19.478
to satisfy anyone's curiosity

41:19.479 --> 41:21.113
by posting pictures
of me with a boyfriend

41:21.114 --> 41:23.148
or a girlfriend on social media,
like every other millennial.

41:23.149 --> 41:24.650
And I always justified that by thinking,

41:24.651 --> 41:26.385
"What does it matter about
me?" I mean, there's so many

41:26.386 --> 41:27.786
more important things
going on in the world,

41:27.787 --> 41:28.921
like what just happened in Rome.

41:28.922 --> 41:32.558
I mean, who cares about my sexuality?

41:32.559 --> 41:35.627
But I realize now it's
m-maybe kind of the opposite.

41:35.628 --> 41:38.397
That if I can't be honest
with people about who I am,

41:38.398 --> 41:41.734
then how can I ever have an
honest experience with them?

41:41.735 --> 41:44.303
Sorry. I really hope I'm not
crossing the line right now.

41:44.304 --> 41:45.938
It's just, I couldn't
wait another minute,

41:45.939 --> 41:48.540
because I just, I respect
you and I like you so much.

41:48.541 --> 41:50.876
And I think that we know
each other pretty well,

41:50.877 --> 41:53.278
and I'd like to think that
you kind of like me, too.

41:53.279 --> 41:55.380
And if I can't be open
with you about this,

41:55.381 --> 41:57.983
then how is any of that even true?

41:57.984 --> 41:59.785
That's all.

41:59.786 --> 42:01.519
Good night.

42:22.775 --> 42:24.842
Good night, Blake.
