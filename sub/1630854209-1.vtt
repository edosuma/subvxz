You're the boss now, hmm?

00:18.219 --> 00:19.420
Oh, I'm a boss.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.621
I also have a boss.

00:20.721 --> 00:22.090
I have lots of bosses.
It's...

00:22.190 --> 00:24.492
You be too busy
to come see me.

00:24.592 --> 00:25.959
No, I'll be working

00:26.060 --> 00:28.062

00:28.162 --> 00:29.397

00:50.651 --> 00:53.687
Where are they, Rastaman?
Where my money at?

00:53.787 --> 00:56.324
First you hand over.
What's going on please?

00:56.424 --> 00:57.525
Get out of my van, sucker.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.227
I ain't handing over nothing.

01:05.933 --> 01:08.836
Police! Put the gun down.
Drop it now.

01:08.936 --> 01:10.571
You are police?

01:10.671 --> 01:12.240
W-What's going on?
Stay in the van!

01:15.809 --> 01:17.278
I'm a retired cop.
What can I do?

01:17.378 --> 01:19.280
Stay with them and call 911.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.618
Hold it right there.

01:38.332 --> 01:39.300
Go inside.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.803
Go inside and
stay inside.

02:09.497 --> 02:11.031
Someone let that cat out
just now?

02:12.065 --> 02:13.167
He in here?

02:55.509 --> 02:56.910
Suspect was male, five-eight,

02:57.010 --> 02:57.978
big frame,

02:58.078 --> 02:59.980
black firearm,
looked like a Glock.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.750
Van driver's on his way
to the hospital.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.152
Other two who were shot,
both DOA.

03:07.087 --> 03:09.122
I didn't have a clean shot
or I would've taken it.

03:09.223 --> 03:11.225
No one'll make you
wrong for that.

03:12.059 --> 03:15.429
Nice to meet you,
Detective Morales.

03:15.529 --> 03:16.864
This is Detective Killian.

03:16.964 --> 03:18.031
Detective.

03:18.131 --> 03:20.000
Nice to meet you.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.406
What?
Nothing.

03:25.506 --> 03:26.740
You already got her
pegged, don't you?

03:26.840 --> 03:28.242
What, you don't?

03:28.342 --> 03:29.443
She comes from Anti-Crime,

03:29.543 --> 03:30.844
she was in Narcotics
at the Five-Five,

03:30.944 --> 03:32.346
plus she was awarded
the Combat Cross.

03:32.446 --> 03:34.214
Yeah, none of that tells you
what it's gonna be like

03:34.315 --> 03:35.316
working for her.

03:35.416 --> 03:36.484
She'll always be
a diversity hire

03:36.584 --> 03:37.818
as far as you're
concerned, right?

03:37.918 --> 03:39.887
Did I say that?
It's what you're thinking.

03:39.987 --> 03:41.355
You got no idea what
I'm thinking.

03:41.455 --> 03:43.023
All right, Bentley,
your first crime scene.

03:43.123 --> 03:45.259
Don't just look on
the ground for shell casings.

03:45.359 --> 03:46.327
Look for projectiles.

03:46.427 --> 03:48.362
Sometimes they go
into tires.

03:48.462 --> 03:49.563
That's why you want to
look for flats.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.164
You got one more
over there.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.268
Check it out.

03:54.368 --> 03:55.503
Those are the bosses.

03:55.603 --> 03:57.305
The one on the right
is Chief Suarez.

03:57.405 --> 03:58.372
He's the borough commander.

03:58.472 --> 04:01.309
Our new boss-- he's her boss.

04:01.409 --> 04:03.777
Who are those guys?
Big shots from downtown.

04:03.877 --> 04:06.213
Whenever there are cameras,
they show up.

04:06.314 --> 04:08.282
What are we looking at, Chief?

04:08.382 --> 04:09.717
Got an attempted carjacking.

04:09.817 --> 04:11.785
Driver of a dollar van
was shot and wounded.

04:11.885 --> 04:14.154
Uh, two fatalities.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.756
The new C.O. of
the Seven-Four,

04:15.856 --> 04:17.391
she happened to be
on the scene here

04:17.491 --> 04:19.960
when it went down.
Is that her?

04:20.060 --> 04:21.529
Yeah.

04:21.629 --> 04:23.964
Bring her over here.

04:24.064 --> 04:25.198
Inspector?

04:25.299 --> 04:26.800
Deputy Inspector, isn't it?

04:26.900 --> 04:29.036
Right.
Deputy Inspector.

04:29.136 --> 04:31.405
Deputy Mayor Sharpe.

04:31.505 --> 04:33.240
Regina Haywood.
How do you do?

04:33.341 --> 04:34.675
This is Adam Lustig.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.043
Adam's the major developer
in East New York.

04:36.143 --> 04:37.911
We were touring
his new project site.

04:38.011 --> 04:39.813
You've had a hell
of a morning, huh?

04:39.913 --> 04:41.982
How did you let him get away,
Deputy Inspector?

04:42.082 --> 04:43.551
Oh, we're
just now starting to...

04:43.651 --> 04:45.018
No, no, no, no, no.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.754
I was under fire
on the street,

04:46.854 --> 04:48.556
I pursued the perp
into a building

04:48.656 --> 04:50.424
from which there was
more than one way out.

04:50.524 --> 04:51.959
Any other questions?

04:52.059 --> 04:55.028
Probably your strength's
in management, am I right?

04:55.128 --> 04:57.498

Inspector Haywood,
welcome to the Seven-Four.

05:53.387 --> 05:54.455
Are you all right?

05:54.555 --> 05:55.789
I'm fine.
Tell me, who are you?

05:55.889 --> 05:58.358
Jimmy Kee, patrol sergeant
on the day tour.

05:58.459 --> 05:59.359
What happened earlier,

05:59.460 --> 06:00.661
I'm very sorry

06:00.761 --> 06:02.763
it had to happen
on your very first day.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.264
But we managed to get
your picture up

06:04.364 --> 06:06.934
on the wall.
Ah, yeah. I appreciate that.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.637
Which way is my office,
Sergeant?
Come on, I'll show you.

06:13.140 --> 06:16.076
<i>A little bit of everything
here in East New York.</i>

06:16.176 --> 06:17.678
Yeah.

06:17.778 --> 06:21.281
When I was a little girl,
my aunt lived on Pitkin Avenue,

06:21.381 --> 06:22.983
so I know the area pretty well.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.251
Oh, here, here, hold on.

06:24.351 --> 06:27.455
Let me help you.
Oh, thank you.

06:27.555 --> 06:29.089
Got a couple of stops
on the L-train,

06:29.189 --> 06:31.024
past where all the creatives
want to live at present and,

06:31.124 --> 06:33.226
you know, we got some excellent
restaurants, nonetheless.

06:33.326 --> 06:35.228
Better, right?

06:35.328 --> 06:36.797
Let there be light, you know?
Nice.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.265
Listen, can I ask you
a question?

06:38.365 --> 06:39.567
Have you made any determination

06:39.667 --> 06:42.169
as to your executive officer?
I haven't.

06:42.269 --> 06:43.837
Might I throw my hat
in the ring?

06:43.937 --> 06:45.372
Why do you want it?

06:45.473 --> 06:48.676
I irritate people.
I know this about myself.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.377
You know, people
write me off because

06:50.478 --> 06:52.145
I'll make mention of finding
a Mercury dime in my change,

06:52.245 --> 06:56.684
or-or I'll recount the plot
of an old <i>Twilight Zone</i> episode.

06:56.784 --> 06:58.251
And I'd like them to
take a second look at

06:58.351 --> 07:01.522
what I'm capable of,
i.e. executive functions

07:01.622 --> 07:03.791
of an executive officer.

07:03.891 --> 07:06.393
You're on.

07:07.360 --> 07:08.762
Really?

07:08.862 --> 07:10.864
Okay, great.
Yeah, that's great.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.232
I'm sure you're all aware
that we had

07:12.332 --> 07:13.767
a double homicide
this morning.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.636
At this point, we don't know
if it's a war between

07:15.736 --> 07:18.806
the van drivers or what,
so special attention to

07:18.906 --> 07:20.073
dollar vans.

07:20.173 --> 07:21.742
Generally, most of them
are unlicensed

07:21.842 --> 07:22.943
and uninspected.

07:23.043 --> 07:24.211
Sandeford and Bentley,

07:24.311 --> 07:25.513
notify the wife
of the van driver,

07:25.613 --> 07:27.681
and take her to the hospital.

07:27.781 --> 07:30.350
Ten-hut!

07:30.450 --> 07:31.719
At ease.

07:35.723 --> 07:37.591
For those of you
who don't know,

07:37.691 --> 07:39.426
my name is Regina Haywood.

07:39.527 --> 07:41.461
I've been a street cop
most of my career,

07:41.562 --> 07:45.533
and like a lot of you,
I've had all kinds of ideas.

07:45.633 --> 07:47.935
What should be done differently,

07:48.035 --> 07:49.570
and what can be done better.

07:49.670 --> 07:52.372
Now I get to see
if some of those ideas

07:52.472 --> 07:53.774
might actually work.

07:53.874 --> 07:56.910
The double homicide
Sergeant Kee mentioned

07:57.010 --> 08:00.347
was that of a German tourist
and a security guard,

08:00.447 --> 08:01.749
murdered in broad daylight.

08:01.849 --> 08:04.417
That is totally unacceptable.

08:04.518 --> 08:06.820
And if it were two young
gang members,

08:06.920 --> 08:11.024
that would also be
totally unacceptable.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.894
We, all together,
are going to stem

08:13.994 --> 08:16.564
this kind of violence
in East New York.

08:16.664 --> 08:19.032
I'm going to ask a great deal

08:19.132 --> 08:21.401
of each and every one of you.

08:21.501 --> 08:24.271
And I want you to know
that if you do your job

08:24.371 --> 08:26.907
the way it is meant
to be done,

08:27.007 --> 08:28.308
I got your backs.

08:28.408 --> 08:31.378
So, no more quotas
on traffic tickets,

08:31.478 --> 08:34.982
penny-ante pot busts,
selling loosies

08:35.082 --> 08:36.283
or loitering on the streets.

08:36.383 --> 08:37.818
We're gonna focus elsewhere.

08:37.918 --> 08:39.787
I also want members
of the service

08:39.887 --> 08:42.289
to start living near
where they work.

08:42.389 --> 08:43.991
You mean in East New York?

08:44.992 --> 08:46.226
Who are you?

08:46.326 --> 08:47.728
Officer Matthew Lyle.

08:47.828 --> 08:51.031
Yeah, Officer Matthew Lyle.

08:51.131 --> 08:52.365
In East New York.

08:52.465 --> 08:53.967
Lyle volunteers his ex-wife.

08:55.102 --> 08:56.670
I've gotten Ruskin Gardens

08:56.770 --> 08:58.338
to provide us with two

08:58.438 --> 09:01.541
one-bedroom apartments,
rent free.

09:01.642 --> 09:04.144
This is strictly voluntary,
but I'd want at least

09:04.244 --> 09:05.846
a six-month commitment.

09:05.946 --> 09:07.848
I'll do it.

09:10.918 --> 09:12.419
Why don't you take some time
and think about it.

09:12.519 --> 09:13.954
I don't need time, Inspector.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.856
You asked for volunteers.
I volunteer.

09:17.725 --> 09:20.260
Building manager's Rivera.
You get the keys from him.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.663
Okay, thank you, everybody.
Dismissed, Sergeant.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.131
Thank you, Inspector.

09:36.844 --> 09:37.878
Oh...

09:37.978 --> 09:39.713
Sorry, you can't
go in there right now.

09:39.813 --> 09:41.348
This is his wife.
Check back in a half hour.

09:41.448 --> 09:42.616
There's a vending machine downstairs.

09:42.716 --> 09:43.884
Why don't you grab her
a cup of coffee.

09:43.984 --> 09:44.952
Yep, you got it.

09:45.052 --> 09:46.754
Ma'am.

09:46.854 --> 09:48.155
Is there anyone
you could think of

09:48.255 --> 09:50.357
that your husband might have
had a dispute with?

09:50.457 --> 09:52.192
Maybe another driver?

09:52.292 --> 09:54.695
He's a good man, my husband.

09:54.795 --> 09:57.898
Does he work for
himself or for somebody else?

09:58.832 --> 10:02.569
He-he work for Beansie Sayso.

10:06.406 --> 10:08.341
<i>What can you tell us about
Lynton McKay, Beansie?</i>

10:08.441 --> 10:11.244
Good guy. No problems.

10:11.344 --> 10:12.579
I-I was just on my way
to see him.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.381
Tough racket,
these dollar vans, huh?

10:14.481 --> 10:17.317
Probably gotta spread enough
cash around to traffic agents

10:17.417 --> 10:18.686
so they don't bury you
in tickets.

10:18.786 --> 10:20.988
Come on, I give a stiff
from Taxi and Limousine

10:21.088 --> 10:22.055
a twenty at Christmastime.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.256
You're gonna crucify me
for that?

10:23.356 --> 10:24.892
No, I'll let that go.

10:24.992 --> 10:27.427
But if you had a driver who
wasn't kicking back clipped,

10:27.527 --> 10:28.762
that I would take
an interest in.

10:28.862 --> 10:31.965
Sandeford, on the lives
of my children...

10:32.065 --> 10:34.167
How come these Moncler jackets
still have tags on them?

10:34.267 --> 10:36.103
Oh, they're seconds.

10:36.203 --> 10:39.006
A friend of mine sells them
at flea markets.

10:39.106 --> 10:40.741
He got a disability,
so I help him out.

10:40.841 --> 10:42.575
Are you gonna help us out?

10:44.577 --> 10:47.647
Maybe Lynton owed money.
I-I don't know.

10:47.748 --> 10:50.350
He was short a lot of the time.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.853
Hey, I'm guessing you're
an Air Jordan guy, am I right?

10:52.953 --> 10:55.689
What size are you?
I'm good, thanks.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.257
Grab the other end. Hopefully,

10:57.357 --> 10:58.892
these don't turn out
to be stolen, Beansie,

10:58.992 --> 11:00.227
on behalf of your
disabled friend.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.162
Okay, okay.

11:02.262 --> 11:05.365
I'm guessing that Lynton
owed money to the Russian.

11:05.465 --> 11:07.935
Which Russian are we
talking about?

11:12.973 --> 11:14.541
<i>I've been thinking,</i>

11:14.641 --> 11:15.876
if we buy this place,
we should do something

11:15.976 --> 11:17.444
different with the bar
menu, you know, like

11:17.544 --> 11:19.512
not the usual nachos
and sliders.

11:19.612 --> 11:21.614
McKay's still sedated.

11:21.715 --> 11:24.184
How you doing, gorgeous?
Mm. Get a BLT, handsome?

11:24.284 --> 11:28.789
Lou-Ann, you wanna come out
and take some orders?
Okay, Goody.

11:28.889 --> 11:32.592
I, uh, got an all-cash
offer this morning

11:32.692 --> 11:34.094
from a restaurant chain,

11:34.194 --> 11:36.797
and the number's higher
than what we agreed on.

11:36.897 --> 11:38.966
So, what is it, we're out?

11:39.066 --> 11:41.501
They want to close on Friday.

11:41.601 --> 11:43.303
Come up with 30,000 by then,

11:43.403 --> 11:45.138
the joint's yours.
It's hers.

11:45.238 --> 11:46.506
Whatever you want.

11:48.241 --> 11:50.077
How are you gonna do that?

11:50.177 --> 11:52.579
Take out a loan.

11:52.679 --> 11:54.214
Hey, hey!
Hey!

11:54.314 --> 11:55.548
Lou-Ann.

11:55.648 --> 11:58.151
Ooh. What's the special today?

11:58.251 --> 12:00.553
What's the difference?
You always order the same thing.

12:00.653 --> 12:03.390
Don't mess with success, baby.

12:03.490 --> 12:05.759
I'd like to see the specials.
Sure thing, rookie.

12:05.859 --> 12:07.727
The guy you want to
talk to is Nickie Dushkin.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.696
Russian. Small-time
loan shark.

12:09.797 --> 12:11.564
It's possible that
the van driver might've missed

12:11.664 --> 12:13.300
one payment too many.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.468
Forget it, Lou-Ann.
All right.

12:15.568 --> 12:16.870
Love you.
Love you.

12:16.970 --> 12:19.139

You selling those?
Why?

Just thirsty.

12:47.167 --> 12:50.938
Sandeford done took
everything else I was selling.

12:53.073 --> 12:54.541

No.

13:14.962 --> 13:16.329

13:17.464 --> 13:19.933
Bidding on a Cordoba.
Uh-huh.

13:20.033 --> 13:22.602
You know, the ads that
Ricardo Montablán used to do.

13:22.702 --> 13:24.972
"Rich Corinthian leather."
Yeah.

13:25.072 --> 13:27.875
That one. I'll be next door
if you need me. Yeah.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.578
You asked for Stan Yenko
to be your executive officer?

13:31.678 --> 13:32.579
He wants the job.

13:32.679 --> 13:33.680
That's the first decision

13:33.780 --> 13:34.814
you're gonna live to regret.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.383
We'll see.
All right.

13:36.483 --> 13:37.985
Right about now
you're probably wishing

13:38.085 --> 13:40.053
you would have gotten
a nice quiet command

13:40.153 --> 13:41.221
in Bayside.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.755
They're not gonna let me
do my thing

13:42.856 --> 13:43.991
in Bayside,
you know that.

13:44.091 --> 13:45.792
Whereas in East New York... Exactly.

13:45.893 --> 13:48.528
They're just grateful
you show up for work.

13:48.628 --> 13:50.097
How's your head?

13:50.197 --> 13:54.567
It's, um, it's fabulous,
stupendous. It's okay.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.003
Doesn't have to be, you know.

13:56.103 --> 13:58.005
If I want to make
changes around here, it does.

13:58.105 --> 13:59.772
You might want to ease into
all of that.

13:59.873 --> 14:01.141
No, I don't have that luxury.

14:01.241 --> 14:03.310
People keep getting killed
at this rate,

14:03.410 --> 14:04.844
the job's gonna dump me,
and they're gonna

14:04.945 --> 14:07.347
give my command to someone else.

14:08.882 --> 14:11.251
Whatever it is
that I want to get done,

14:11.351 --> 14:13.353
I've got to do it fast.

14:17.657 --> 14:18.959
I'm right there with you, Regina.

14:19.059 --> 14:21.261
And I'm counting on that.

14:33.506 --> 14:35.976
How you doing, Lynton?

14:36.076 --> 14:37.177
He's feeling better.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.346
Can we ask you
some questions?

14:40.213 --> 14:41.614
Who's Nickie Dushkin?

14:44.817 --> 14:47.420
So you understand,
your husband was in possession

14:47.520 --> 14:48.721
of an illegal handgun,

14:48.821 --> 14:51.058
and he fired that handgun
in New York City.

14:51.158 --> 14:52.525
He was being shot at hisself.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.627
And if he cooperates,
they may go easy on him.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.696
You think they won't send you
to prison because you're shot?

14:56.796 --> 14:59.066
You think that cop
sitting outside your door

14:59.166 --> 15:00.100
is there to keep you company?

15:00.200 --> 15:02.335
I tell you I don't know him.

15:02.435 --> 15:03.971
You gonna protect us now.

15:04.071 --> 15:08.775
Either he's gonna tell you
or I'm gonna tell you.

15:13.313 --> 15:14.581
Hey, Lustig.

15:14.681 --> 15:16.316
The real estate developer
who was with

15:16.416 --> 15:17.550
Herr Deputy Mayor
this morning.

15:17.650 --> 15:20.487
Yeah, he came by
after the shooting.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.260
How you doing, Nikolai?

15:27.360 --> 15:28.695
Who are you?

15:28.795 --> 15:30.563
We're detectives from
the Seven-Four Squad.

15:30.663 --> 15:32.465
We just want to ask
you some questions.

15:32.565 --> 15:33.800
No big thing.

15:33.900 --> 15:35.635
Ask questions,
you have questions.

15:35.735 --> 15:37.370
Well, they like us to do it
in the question-asking room.

15:37.470 --> 15:38.905
Where is
the question-asking room?

15:39.006 --> 15:41.441
Someplace where everyone
won't be up in your business.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.343
I don't have business.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.178
We can do it loud,
or we can do it quiet.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.779
Quiet's better.

15:55.855 --> 15:57.024
Hey, Sandeford.

15:57.124 --> 15:58.591
Hey.
Hey, I was talking
to this guy

15:58.691 --> 15:59.826
Winston over at Ruskin Gardens.
He said that

15:59.926 --> 16:01.294
you've been doing
some confiscating.

16:01.394 --> 16:02.329
Did he tell you he was
selling T-shirts

16:02.429 --> 16:03.296
in front of a clothing store

16:03.396 --> 16:04.197
when I told him three times

16:04.297 --> 16:05.165
to move somewhere else?

16:05.265 --> 16:06.266
I didn't say you were wrong.

16:06.366 --> 16:07.300
What a relief.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.601
Help me out here, Marvin.

16:08.701 --> 16:09.702
I'll help you out
when I have to go into

16:09.802 --> 16:11.004
the projects and save your ass.

16:11.104 --> 16:12.605
'Cause I'm a scared little
white girl

16:12.705 --> 16:13.640
that needs a big,
strong man to save her?

16:13.740 --> 16:14.807
Yeah, something like that. Yeah.

16:14.907 --> 16:16.576
The day I need you
to save me

16:16.676 --> 16:18.578
is the day
I put in my papers.

16:21.081 --> 16:22.749
Let me see you for a minute.

16:23.916 --> 16:25.752
Hold this.

16:25.852 --> 16:28.455
'79 Cordoba.

16:30.523 --> 16:31.891
What was that, Officer?
You're putting a cop

16:31.991 --> 16:33.760
with less than
three years on the job

16:33.860 --> 16:35.595
in one of the highest crime
housing projects in the city.

16:35.695 --> 16:36.996
I'm making changes.
I want to have

16:37.097 --> 16:39.032
community policing
mean something.

16:39.132 --> 16:40.567
It's been tried
other places, Marvin.

16:40.667 --> 16:41.868
Tacoma, Washington,
Portland, Maine...

16:41.968 --> 16:43.570
There are people
in that housing project

16:43.670 --> 16:46.739
who, first chance they get,
they gonna test her.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.007
Kinda like you're
testing me, right?

16:48.108 --> 16:49.309
Since you're a deputy inspector,

16:49.409 --> 16:50.277
I assume you've
already been tested.

16:50.377 --> 16:51.678
Let's make this simple.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.680
If you can't keep
your skepticism to yourself,

16:53.780 --> 16:55.548
at least don't undermine
my decisions

16:55.648 --> 16:57.917
with younger officers
who don't share them.

17:00.553 --> 17:02.655
Yes, ma'am.

17:05.958 --> 17:07.760
While I don't discount
his point of view entirely,

17:07.860 --> 17:10.297
I also don't appreciate
his sarcasm.

17:10.397 --> 17:12.799
Put in a call
to the housing PSA.

17:12.899 --> 17:14.501
Make sure the C.O. knows that

17:14.601 --> 17:16.536
there's gonna be a cop
living in Ruskin Gardens.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.105
Make sure they have it covered.

17:18.205 --> 17:19.939
Mm-hmm.

17:43.996 --> 17:45.432
Hmm.

17:45.532 --> 17:48.701
Meeting in the Community Room
tomorrow night at 7:30.

17:48.801 --> 17:49.702
For what?

17:49.802 --> 17:51.638
Just to introduce myself.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.173
Which, I'm Brandy, by the way.

17:53.273 --> 17:55.108
Ah.
You gonna be there?

17:55.208 --> 17:56.609
Hell no.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.111
Well, hopefully somebody
shows up.

17:59.212 --> 18:02.215
You gonna wait a long time
for that elevator.

Been busted going on a month.

18:04.050 --> 18:06.085
You, um...

18:06.186 --> 18:07.587
You wouldn't be willing
to give me a hand

18:07.687 --> 18:09.556
by any chance, would you?

18:10.357 --> 18:11.991
What floor?

18:16.996 --> 18:19.499

of Yonkers.

You're here

18:41.588 --> 18:42.622
My boss wants to
have cops living here

in the projects so that

18:44.757 --> 18:46.125
people could get to know us.

18:46.226 --> 18:48.628
And hopefully that helps
make the community safer.

19:21.261 --> 19:23.630
I made some calls
to check my thinking about you,

19:23.730 --> 19:25.097
and I could not have been
more wrong.

19:25.198 --> 19:27.033
You headed up a task force
credited with taking

19:27.133 --> 19:29.702
73 guns off the street
in a year's time.

19:29.802 --> 19:33.039
Your arrests put away
a dozen members of MS-13.

19:33.139 --> 19:35.308
As far as your initiative
to put cops

19:35.408 --> 19:39.312
in public housing,
I applaud it.

19:39.412 --> 19:40.747
I salute it.

19:40.847 --> 19:43.783
I would only ask that you
coordinate with my office

19:43.883 --> 19:45.352
before making any arrangements.

19:45.452 --> 19:47.787
I went through the Borough
and the Housing Authority.

19:47.887 --> 19:49.789
I didn't realize I had to
go through your office as well.

19:49.889 --> 19:52.124
My office, Deputy Inspector.

19:52.225 --> 19:54.160
Always my office.

19:54.261 --> 19:55.795
Anyway, finding out

19:55.895 --> 19:57.764
about your accomplishments
has put to rest

19:57.864 --> 19:59.532
some of the rumors

19:59.632 --> 20:00.733
that attribute your
career advancement

20:00.833 --> 20:02.168
to other factors.

20:02.269 --> 20:04.304
What kind of factors?

20:05.905 --> 20:07.674
Do I have to
spell it out for you?
No.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.909
You really don't.

20:10.009 --> 20:12.612
I've had to deal with rumors
my whole career.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.282
Men are threatened
by powerful women.

20:15.382 --> 20:17.584
When they're threatened,
they turn vicious.

20:17.684 --> 20:20.587
Really, all they are
is scared.

20:25.492 --> 20:28.561
Thanks for not
spelling it out.

20:28.661 --> 20:30.630
How do you know Lynton McKay?

20:30.730 --> 20:32.865
I don't know him.

20:32.965 --> 20:35.268
We heard he might have
borrowed money from you.

20:35.368 --> 20:36.736
Maybe he couldn't pay it back.

20:36.836 --> 20:38.471
Any truth to that?
I already tell you,

20:38.571 --> 20:39.872
I don't know this guy.

20:39.972 --> 20:41.274
What do you think
the chances are

20:41.374 --> 20:42.742
we <i>won't</i> find your prints
in that apartment

20:42.842 --> 20:44.176
that you ran through
this morning?

20:44.277 --> 20:46.579
Same chance I don't fall
for trick.

20:46.679 --> 20:48.180
A hundred percent.

20:49.982 --> 20:51.318
I think now I talk to lawyer.

20:51.418 --> 20:53.986
What do you think a lawyer's
gonna do for you?

21:02.562 --> 21:03.796
He asked for a lawyer.
Game over.

21:03.896 --> 21:05.365
We are just getting started, Inspector.

21:05.465 --> 21:07.233
We're gonna let him
call a lawyer at some point.

21:07.334 --> 21:09.802
That's what you're gonna say
on the stand?

21:09.902 --> 21:11.571
You let him call a lawyer
at some point?

21:11.671 --> 21:12.972
Look, we know what to say
on the stand.

21:13.072 --> 21:15.207
I'm sure you do, but as long
as I'm your boss,

21:15.308 --> 21:16.709
you will only say it
if it's true.

21:16.809 --> 21:19.178
The lying in this precinct
stops now.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.813
You get his phone records,
you see if there are

21:20.913 --> 21:22.515
prints on file, you let him go.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.283
Just like that?
Just like that!

21:29.088 --> 21:31.791
So she's a detective now,
right? Okay.

21:31.891 --> 21:33.460
We knew she was gonna be
hands-on.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.261
Who gets heat we don't
solve this, huh?

21:35.362 --> 21:37.830
Us. Who's standing next to
the PC at a press conference

21:37.930 --> 21:39.065
if we do? Her!

21:39.165 --> 21:41.233
We gotta give her a chance.

21:45.872 --> 21:47.273
How long you gonna
put up with him?

21:47.374 --> 21:49.175
Depends how good a detective
he is.
Shouldn't.

21:49.275 --> 21:51.110
Maybe in that quiet
precinct in Bayside...

21:51.210 --> 21:52.612
I don't tolerate disrespect
no matter what precinct.

21:52.712 --> 21:54.046
You gotta housebreak 'em.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.982
I need them to be a lot more
than housebroken, Chief.

21:56.082 --> 21:57.850
I need them to bust
their asses for me.

21:57.950 --> 21:59.919
Good luck with that. Thanks.

on the sixth floor?

23:12.692 --> 23:13.926
My cousin lives on
the sixth floor.
Ronnie Moe.

23:14.026 --> 23:16.663
What's up?
This lady cop's
harassing me

23:16.763 --> 23:17.897
for no reason, Sandeford.

23:17.997 --> 23:19.398
I find out you're lying,

23:19.499 --> 23:21.634
I run your name, any
felony convictions come up,

23:21.734 --> 23:23.335
you're out of the projects.

23:27.306 --> 23:28.708
Thank you for showing up.

23:28.808 --> 23:30.309
I don't know what I would
have done without you.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.278
Keep this with you.

23:32.378 --> 23:33.980
How'd you get that?

23:34.080 --> 23:35.448
I told 'em you were
the only cop living here,

23:35.548 --> 23:36.483
and it's possible
you may need a radio

23:36.583 --> 23:37.817
in the middle of the night.

23:40.653 --> 23:42.088
Now, some of what I said yesterday,

23:42.188 --> 23:43.490
I shouldn't have said.

23:43.590 --> 23:45.558
But I worry about people
because that's what I do.

23:45.658 --> 23:47.326
Now, I don't want you
not calling for backup

23:47.426 --> 23:49.361
'cause that's what you do.

23:53.365 --> 23:54.333
Want a coffee?

24:05.745 --> 24:08.147
The branch manager said
no dice.

24:08.247 --> 24:09.582
What's "ramps"?

24:09.682 --> 24:11.050
Some kind of vegetable.

24:11.150 --> 24:14.487
"Finocchio"?

24:14.587 --> 24:16.022
Is that the menu
Corinne's working on?

24:16.122 --> 24:17.524
Yeah. She sent it to me.

24:17.624 --> 24:20.159
Ah, I got no idea
where I'm gonna get the money.

24:20.259 --> 24:21.494
What about some <i>chuletas?</i>

24:21.594 --> 24:23.563
Mofongo. <i>Sancocho.</i>

24:23.663 --> 24:25.197
Guess I gotta tell her.
Yeah, and while you're at it,

24:25.297 --> 24:27.033
why don't you tell her that
there's a lot more Puerto Ricans

24:27.133 --> 24:30.069
in East New York than people
that know what ramps are.

24:35.374 --> 24:36.709
Hey, hey.

24:36.809 --> 24:39.145
Baby!

24:39.245 --> 24:40.446
What are you doing here?

24:40.547 --> 24:42.214
I just, um, gotta
hit the head.

24:42.314 --> 24:44.216
Okay...

24:44.316 --> 24:47.353
And the bank turned me down.

24:50.690 --> 24:53.492
So it looks like plan B.
What are you doing?

24:53.593 --> 24:56.195
I've been working
in restaurants since I'm 19.

24:56.295 --> 24:57.530
I want to own that place.

24:57.630 --> 25:00.299
Opening a restaurant is
a risky proposition.

25:00.399 --> 25:01.734
We take money from your father,

25:01.834 --> 25:03.269
and this joint goes under,
that's on me.

25:03.369 --> 25:05.071
Except he offered,
and he would be

25:05.171 --> 25:06.973
loaning the money to me.
Don't make a difference.

25:07.073 --> 25:10.309
Killian, if you can't come up
with the money by tonight,

25:10.409 --> 25:12.745
I am taking my father up
on his offer.

25:12.845 --> 25:14.881
Come in on it with me
or don't.

25:29.962 --> 25:31.864
What am I doing?
What am I doing?

25:31.964 --> 25:33.800
What am <i>I</i> doing?
What are <i>you</i> doing?

25:36.502 --> 25:38.504
Ah, I'm doing this for her.

25:38.605 --> 25:41.841
Cop walks into a bar,
steals a bat.

25:46.045 --> 25:47.780
What's going on, Tommy?
Hey, is Zev around?

25:47.880 --> 25:49.515
He'll be in around 5:00.
You bouncing tonight?

25:49.616 --> 25:51.083
No, no, no, I think
I forgot something

25:51.183 --> 25:52.218
back in the office.

25:52.318 --> 25:54.253
Thanks.

26:14.140 --> 26:15.041
Can I help you?

26:15.141 --> 26:16.542
This Lynton McKay's room?

26:16.643 --> 26:18.711
Who wants to know?
I'm a friend.

26:18.811 --> 26:21.180
And what's your name?
Didier.

26:22.949 --> 26:25.852
Didier's here to see you.

26:25.952 --> 26:28.187
Hey.

26:28.287 --> 26:29.989
What a-going, Didier?

26:30.089 --> 26:33.760
I was worried about you
when I heard you got shot.

26:33.860 --> 26:36.929
I rushed right over.
It's good to see you.

26:37.029 --> 26:40.532
The nurse'll be by to throw
you out in just a few minutes

26:40.633 --> 26:43.636
so, enjoy your visit
while you can.

27:00.152 --> 27:02.889
Goody. Ain't you too old
to be doing this?

27:02.989 --> 27:04.290
I'd ask you to give me a hand,
but I'd say

27:04.390 --> 27:06.959
you're too old
your own damn self.

27:07.059 --> 27:10.462
Hey, you still in good standing
with Future Felons of America?

27:10.562 --> 27:11.964
What do you need?

27:12.064 --> 27:13.599
One of them over there
at Ruskin Gardens snatched

27:13.700 --> 27:14.834
my partner's hat.

27:14.934 --> 27:16.568
How the hell
you let 'em do that?

27:16.669 --> 27:18.037
Playing basketball.

27:18.137 --> 27:19.972
His sport's tennis.

27:22.274 --> 27:23.409
Yeah, okay, Arthur Ashe.

27:23.509 --> 27:25.044
Check back with me tonight.

27:31.718 --> 27:34.220
Lynton? Lynton?!

27:34.320 --> 27:36.255
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

27:36.355 --> 27:38.390
Lynton, you can't
leave me now,

27:38.490 --> 27:40.893
Lynton. Lynton!
Code Blue.
Code Blue. Crash cart.

27:40.993 --> 27:42.494
You have to let him do his job.
You have to let him

27:42.594 --> 27:44.130
do his job.
Lynton. Lynton. Please.

27:44.230 --> 27:46.265
Lynton!
Come on. Come on, let's go.

27:47.066 --> 27:49.802
Brenda Sykes said
she waiting on the diamonds.

27:49.902 --> 27:51.270
Let her wait.

27:51.370 --> 27:54.006
I hid 'em in a gas tank.
Nobody'll find 'em.

27:54.106 --> 27:55.875
Nobody tell
that Brenda Sykes woman...

27:57.643 --> 27:59.611
Lynton? Lynton?!

27:59.712 --> 28:03.315
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

28:04.316 --> 28:06.252
Bring her in.

28:07.619 --> 28:09.288
Please.

28:13.259 --> 28:16.462
I'm sorry for your loss,
Mrs. McKay.

28:16.562 --> 28:19.698
I tell myself
he with God now.

28:19.799 --> 28:21.901
Every hour that goes by
makes it that much harder

28:22.001 --> 28:24.003
for us to find the man
that killed him.

28:24.103 --> 28:26.672
I don't know who that man is,
Miss Lady.

28:26.773 --> 28:28.174
Who's Didier?

28:28.274 --> 28:29.541
My husband's friend.

28:29.641 --> 28:30.642
Who's Brenda Sykes?

28:30.743 --> 28:32.511
Real estate broker.

28:32.611 --> 28:34.814
Now may I please

28:34.914 --> 28:39.251
go and tell my children
that their daddy is gone?

28:40.252 --> 28:41.420
See she gets home.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.231
You wanted to see me?

28:53.299 --> 28:54.566
That was some
quick thinking--

28:54.666 --> 28:56.235
setting your phone to record.

28:56.335 --> 28:58.871
I had a gut feeling that their
conversation might prove useful.

28:58.971 --> 29:01.140
Let's talk about
another gut feeling you had.

29:01.240 --> 29:04.743
Ronald Morrison's mother filed
a complaint with the Civilian

29:04.844 --> 29:06.578
Review Board. Says
you threatened to evict him.

29:06.678 --> 29:09.348
I needed him to know that I took
graffiti on my door seriously.

29:09.448 --> 29:11.683
Why'd you volunteer
to do this, Quinlan?

29:11.784 --> 29:13.585
Because I think
this is a good idea.

29:13.685 --> 29:15.988
And a shortcut
to a gold shield?

29:16.088 --> 29:18.925
If it is, it'll mean
I did a good job, right?

29:19.025 --> 29:21.894
The purpose of the initiative
isn't career advancement.

29:21.994 --> 29:23.930
It's to show the people
who live here

29:24.030 --> 29:26.432
that we're a part of the same
community they're a part of.

29:26.532 --> 29:28.434
We're not an occupying army.

29:28.534 --> 29:30.136
If you don't
believe that, it is

29:30.236 --> 29:33.605
going to make it that much
harder for you to act like it.

29:34.606 --> 29:38.010
I grew up in Section 8 housing
with a drug addict mother,

29:38.110 --> 29:40.980
and when I was 15, I ran away,
and I lived on the streets,

29:41.080 --> 29:43.582
and I didn't consider myself
part of any community

29:43.682 --> 29:45.885
at all, so now?

29:46.718 --> 29:47.987
I'm only too happy to be a part

29:48.087 --> 29:50.756
of whatever community
will have me.

29:52.558 --> 29:55.027
Thank you, Officer Quinlan.

30:02.101 --> 30:03.202
<i>Have you spent any time</i>

30:03.302 --> 30:05.404
in the Ivory Coast,
Ms. Sykes?

30:05.504 --> 30:07.006
Yeah, I've been there.

30:07.106 --> 30:09.041
I've been to a lot of countries
in Africa since I got involved

30:09.141 --> 30:11.277
with the Save the Lions Foundation.

30:11.377 --> 30:12.578
I'm a Leo.

30:12.678 --> 30:14.146
Oh. I'm a Leo.

30:14.246 --> 30:15.882
Is that so?

30:18.150 --> 30:21.888
A kid from the Ivory Coast named
Didier Toure said he knows you.

30:21.988 --> 30:23.789
Oh, yeah. I know Didier. Sure.

30:23.890 --> 30:25.724
How do you know him?

30:25.824 --> 30:27.259
Oh, we met
when I was over there.

30:27.359 --> 30:29.896
He was trying to sell me
a carving, and he has

30:29.996 --> 30:31.830
these gorgeous eyes I couldn't

30:31.931 --> 30:33.165
stop looking at.

30:33.265 --> 30:34.033
So, you know,

30:34.133 --> 30:36.102
one thing led to another.

30:36.202 --> 30:38.237
We actually stayed in touch
for a while.

30:38.337 --> 30:39.872
When's the last time
you heard from him?

30:39.972 --> 30:41.573
Oh. It's been years.

30:41.673 --> 30:43.943
Yeah, well, he says he's been
in touch with you recently.

30:44.043 --> 30:46.812
Well, probably he had a dream.

30:46.913 --> 30:48.380
You know, Africans--
they don't always

30:48.480 --> 30:51.850
distinguish between
what's a dream and what's real.

30:52.684 --> 30:53.986
Hmm.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.993
This is Adam Lustig, isn't it?

31:01.093 --> 31:02.328
Uh-huh.
They say he's going

31:02.428 --> 31:04.263
to transform East New York. Well,

31:04.363 --> 31:08.167
if all goes according to plan,
he absolutely will.

31:13.105 --> 31:15.641
Oh, retail on the ground floor,
85 units above,

31:15.741 --> 31:18.244
and a fantastic space
for what I'm hoping will be

31:18.344 --> 31:21.180
a culinary school
and a yoga studio. Wow.

31:21.280 --> 31:22.648
Wow is right.

31:22.748 --> 31:24.951
What's your relationship
with Brenda Sykes, Mr. Lustig?

31:25.051 --> 31:29.055
Uh, she handles
my residential sales.

31:29.155 --> 31:31.557
Any other
business arrangements?

31:31.657 --> 31:32.858
Are you involved romantically?

31:32.959 --> 31:34.393
No.
Well, it's just

31:34.493 --> 31:35.894
that her name has come up

31:35.995 --> 31:37.329
with regard
to this homicide investigation.

31:37.429 --> 31:40.032
We were wondering if you
could shed some light.

31:40.132 --> 31:42.001
I wish I could.
The name

31:42.101 --> 31:43.902
Nickie Dushkin mean anything?

31:44.003 --> 31:46.105
No.
You sure?

31:46.205 --> 31:48.274
You have a very
accusatory manner.
It's a little curious

31:48.374 --> 31:50.209
you don't know
who Nickie Dushkin is

31:50.309 --> 31:52.578
since he's the site foreman
of the East New York project.

31:52.678 --> 31:54.646
If he's the site foreman,
means he works for the GC.

31:54.746 --> 31:57.283
I have nothing to do them.
Look, I have a conference call

31:57.383 --> 31:58.850
starting so I'm gonna have
to wrap this up.

31:58.951 --> 32:00.852
Do you know a Didier Toure?

32:00.953 --> 32:02.654
No.
Brenda Sykes knows him.

32:02.754 --> 32:05.691
There's some discrepancy
about the last time they spoke.

32:05.791 --> 32:06.993
Look, do me a favor.

32:07.093 --> 32:08.394
Play Sherlock Holmes
on your own time.

32:08.494 --> 32:11.964
One thing I learned
from Sherlock Holmes was that

32:12.064 --> 32:13.966
when people suddenly
become uncooperative,

32:14.066 --> 32:16.969
they usually have something
to hide.

32:18.937 --> 32:20.906
I hate doing this.

32:25.011 --> 32:27.346
You flex, I flex back.

32:30.016 --> 32:31.317
What's going on, Adam?

32:31.417 --> 32:33.986
Sorry to bother you,
Deputy Mayor Sharpe,

32:34.086 --> 32:35.587
but I got these two
detectives here,

32:35.687 --> 32:37.289
and I told them
everything I know about

32:37.389 --> 32:39.525
the East New York shooting--
which is nothing--

32:39.625 --> 32:41.593
but they seem intent
on trying to get me to say

32:41.693 --> 32:43.929
something incriminating,
or intimidating me.

32:44.030 --> 32:46.098
Put 'em on.

32:47.733 --> 32:50.569
This is Detective Tom Killian
with the Seven-Four Squad.

32:50.669 --> 32:53.172
Adam Lustig's a suspect,
Detective Killian?

32:53.272 --> 32:54.973
No, sir.
Then it sounds to me

32:55.074 --> 32:57.509
like maybe you could
wrap things up. Am I right?

32:59.911 --> 33:01.380
I think so.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.049
Thank you, Ray.

33:03.149 --> 33:06.085
You get involved
in homicide investigations, Ray?

33:06.185 --> 33:07.819
When my boy Lustig
asks me to do something,

33:07.919 --> 33:11.023
I like to try to at least act
as though I'm accommodating him.

33:11.123 --> 33:12.424
That's because
of all the wonderful things

33:12.524 --> 33:14.726
he's going to be doing
in East New York, right?

33:14.826 --> 33:16.295
Relationships, my friend.

33:16.395 --> 33:18.430
You have your sites set
on becoming police commissioner.

33:18.530 --> 33:20.466
Which I don't.
And even if you don't...

33:20.566 --> 33:23.302
that's what you need
to be thinking about.

33:23.402 --> 33:25.304
<i>Thanks, Detectives.</i>

33:26.672 --> 33:28.507
If you're lying,

33:28.607 --> 33:32.611
it's not gonna matter
who you can get on the phone.

33:40.952 --> 33:44.490
<i>I work in a diamond mine
in Côte d'Ivoire.</i>

33:44.590 --> 33:46.225
One day, we find blue diamonds.

33:46.325 --> 33:48.360
My boss introduce me
to Miss Sykes

33:48.460 --> 33:50.229
who want me
to take them to New York.

33:50.329 --> 33:52.698
<i>She pay me $1,500,</i>

33:52.798 --> 33:54.833
<i>another $1,500 when I deliver.</i>

33:54.933 --> 33:57.069
How'd you get them
through customs?

33:57.169 --> 33:58.370
I swallow.

33:58.470 --> 33:59.971
What happened
when you got to New York?

34:00.072 --> 34:02.174
It took two day
to pass the diamonds.

34:02.274 --> 34:05.043
<i>Then I give to Lynton.</i>

34:06.845 --> 34:08.114
He say they can't
pay us like we boys.

34:08.214 --> 34:11.483
He hold on
till they pay us like we men.

34:14.786 --> 34:16.922
These $30 million
worth of diamonds

34:17.022 --> 34:18.957
got past customs
in the digestive tract

34:19.057 --> 34:21.660
of a kid named Didier Toure,
whom you admitted knowing.

34:21.760 --> 34:25.497
Hmm. Sounds like
you have a theory, Detective.

34:25.597 --> 34:27.266
Well, it's more
than a theory, Brenda.

34:27.366 --> 34:28.600
We know who shot

34:28.700 --> 34:30.001
the van driver, and we think

34:30.102 --> 34:32.738
you paid him to do it
and get your diamonds back.

34:32.838 --> 34:34.173
You <i>think</i> you know?

34:34.273 --> 34:36.742
We just got hold of

34:36.842 --> 34:38.444
this woman's bank statement.
Really?

34:38.544 --> 34:42.114
I also don't think
you're telling me the truth

34:42.214 --> 34:43.882
about your relationship
with Didier.

34:43.982 --> 34:45.584
Go get her.

34:47.153 --> 34:49.255
You know, I get
the feeling that, um,

34:49.355 --> 34:50.689
you're protecting Lustig.

34:50.789 --> 34:52.858
I was engaged
to a detective once.

34:52.958 --> 34:56.562
Great-looking,
but not real bright.

35:01.467 --> 35:05.103
Well, even not real bright
people get it right sometimes.

35:06.138 --> 35:08.073
You wired $35,000 to an account

35:08.174 --> 35:09.875
in the Cayman Islands
that belongs

35:09.975 --> 35:12.411
to Nikolai Dushkin.
Stand up, Brenda.

35:12.511 --> 35:14.946
You're under arrest.

35:15.046 --> 35:16.915
What? That...

35:17.015 --> 35:18.650
Really? Oh, my God.

35:18.750 --> 35:20.352
You know what?
I have arrhythmia.

35:20.452 --> 35:23.555
We'll be sure to get you medical
attention if you need it.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.697
Wonder what's the real deal
between Lustig and the Russian.

35:31.797 --> 35:33.199
Let me look into it. Okay.

35:33.299 --> 35:36.067
I got a feeling that kid
from the Ivory Coast just wants

35:36.168 --> 35:38.870
to go home. Any reason
we can't send him on his way?

35:38.970 --> 35:41.773
We've got the discretionary
funds to pay for his airfare.

35:41.873 --> 35:43.074
Cash.

35:43.175 --> 35:45.544
That's what I was
going to suggest.

35:48.514 --> 35:50.582
After a deputy mayor

35:50.682 --> 35:53.051
specifically asks
your detectives to back off,

35:53.151 --> 35:55.754
they threaten Adam Lustig?
I'll talk to them.

35:55.854 --> 35:57.256
I want you to go to Lustig
personally and apologize.

35:57.356 --> 36:00.459
And let him at least think
that we're responsive.

36:00.559 --> 36:01.593
How about a dozen roses?

36:01.693 --> 36:02.694
Play the long game, Regina.

36:02.794 --> 36:04.263
To get done what we both want

36:04.363 --> 36:05.631
to get done.

36:05.731 --> 36:07.799
You need your job,
and I need mine.

36:16.975 --> 36:18.844
Adam Lustig around?

36:18.944 --> 36:20.479
He's not.
Can I help you with something?

36:20.579 --> 36:22.348
You know when he'll be back?

36:22.448 --> 36:24.350
I don't. He's flying today.

36:24.450 --> 36:26.117
Can I know what it's about
for when he calls in?

36:26.218 --> 36:27.619
A police matter.

36:27.719 --> 36:30.055
Okay. I'll pass that along.

36:30.155 --> 36:33.058
I assume he'll know
what it means?

36:33.859 --> 36:36.027
I love your nails.

36:36.828 --> 36:38.630

36:47.906 --> 36:50.041
Hey, I just got word.

36:50.141 --> 36:52.744
According
to Lustig's financials,

36:52.844 --> 36:54.179
he'd missed
his last three payments,

36:54.280 --> 36:55.681
and the bank was getting ready
to foreclose.

36:55.781 --> 36:57.182
What I've heard
blue diamonds go for

36:57.283 --> 37:00.051
might have been enough
to keep that from happening.

37:00.151 --> 37:02.120
And phone records show
that there were

37:02.220 --> 37:04.356
a dozen calls
to and from Dushkin

37:04.456 --> 37:05.924
on the day of the shooting.

37:06.024 --> 37:08.694
You know how to track a plane
from its tail numbers?

Of course I do.

Every time I got
the highest bid,

37:22.674 --> 37:24.042
this guy comes swooping in

37:24.142 --> 37:25.477
last minute, bids it up
out of my price range.

37:25.577 --> 37:27.779
And it's not just cars.
Want me to come in?

37:27.879 --> 37:29.481
No, no, no, no, no.
You stay right here.

37:29.581 --> 37:31.383
I'll be right out.

37:38.890 --> 37:40.058
Hey.
Mr. Lustig,

37:40.158 --> 37:42.093
I understand a couple
of my detectives

37:42.193 --> 37:43.495
might've been
out of line today.

37:43.595 --> 37:44.963
Not a big deal.
It's the pressure

37:45.063 --> 37:46.298
of a homicide investigation.
It-it sometimes...

37:46.398 --> 37:48.700
Look, we're about
to take off, Inspector.

37:48.800 --> 37:51.102
Where you headed?
I'm running up to Boston

37:51.202 --> 37:53.539
to look at a...
a few waterfront properties.

37:53.639 --> 37:55.073
Just you?

37:55.173 --> 37:56.775
Just me, and if we're not
wheels-up in a few minutes,

37:56.875 --> 37:58.677
then we lose
our take-off window.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.081
You read Russian, Mr. Lustig?

38:03.181 --> 38:04.550
Take it easy.

38:04.650 --> 38:06.818
Why you don't shoot last time?

38:06.918 --> 38:08.119
I try to avoid it if I can.

38:08.219 --> 38:09.555
Oh. Please just
do what he says.

38:09.655 --> 38:10.856
There's an officer
right outside.

38:10.956 --> 38:12.290
He hears a gunshot,
he's coming in,

38:12.391 --> 38:14.393
and he's calling for backup.
We take off now, yes?

38:14.493 --> 38:15.994
I'm a New York City
police officer.

38:16.094 --> 38:17.863
This plane stays
right where it is.

38:17.963 --> 38:19.197
Put the gun down,

38:19.297 --> 38:20.832
and we talk this through.
All the time worry

38:20.932 --> 38:22.868
innocent slobs get killed
in crossfire.

38:22.968 --> 38:24.235
I do worry about that.

38:24.336 --> 38:27.138
Well, this one--
not so much innocent.

38:27.238 --> 38:29.040
Please just put
your gun down.

38:29.140 --> 38:31.443
I count three.
No, please. Please!

38:31.543 --> 38:33.144
One.
Oh!

38:39.351 --> 38:41.953
Okay.

38:43.321 --> 38:44.923
So you know,

38:45.023 --> 38:47.459
my dealings with Lustig
were always above board.

38:47.559 --> 38:49.428
Glad to hear it.

38:49.528 --> 38:52.030
Nothing my lawyer
can't handle, Ray.

38:52.130 --> 38:54.500
Nothing my lawyer
can't handle.

38:55.901 --> 38:58.437
:
Hey, I got it.

38:58.537 --> 39:00.506
Good work, Detectives.

39:00.606 --> 39:02.073
Thanks.
I had a chance

39:02.173 --> 39:04.443
to look over the
detective squad stats.

39:04.543 --> 39:06.745
You're the most
productive team we got.

39:06.845 --> 39:08.447
Just so your stats
are good, Inspector.

39:08.547 --> 39:11.383
That's what we're all about.

39:14.252 --> 39:16.087
What's with you?

39:20.358 --> 39:22.127
Need a ride?

39:31.770 --> 39:35.240
Hey, I got your stuff back.

39:35.340 --> 39:38.376
Make sure
it's all still there.

39:43.749 --> 39:45.316
How'd you do that?

39:45.417 --> 39:47.052
I got my ways.

39:50.822 --> 39:52.824
Oh!

39:52.924 --> 39:54.726
Nice whip, Captain.

39:54.826 --> 39:56.562
Sometimes it all
works out, Tommy.

39:56.662 --> 39:58.930
Sometimes it all works out.

40:00.532 --> 40:02.968
Um, let's hope
it all works out for us.

40:07.506 --> 40:11.076
Hey, Goody?

40:11.176 --> 40:12.410
Open it.

40:22.320 --> 40:23.522
A bat?

40:23.622 --> 40:25.156
Roy Campanella's bat.

40:26.525 --> 40:28.460
You're kidding.

40:28.560 --> 40:30.629
Game-used from the '55 Series.

40:30.729 --> 40:32.631
Let me get this straight.

40:32.731 --> 40:35.166
You were supposed to be giving
me $30,000 as a down payment.

40:35.266 --> 40:38.837
And instead,
you're giving me a baseball bat?

40:41.640 --> 40:43.308
And it's Campy's bat.

40:43.408 --> 40:46.912
This is a down payment
and then some.

40:47.012 --> 40:48.514
The joint's yours.

40:51.817 --> 40:52.751
Oh!
Oh, my God!

40:54.653 --> 40:57.422
Oh. Oh!

40:59.024 --> 41:01.793
All these cops in here, and
you still need a baseball bat?

41:01.893 --> 41:04.029
It's Roy Campanella's bat.

41:04.129 --> 41:07.265
You're kidding. Oh.

41:08.233 --> 41:10.268
Aw.

41:11.102 --> 41:12.938
Thank you.

41:13.038 --> 41:14.305
If you can tell me where
I can find the kid

41:14.405 --> 41:15.841
who took it,
I'd like to go talk to him.

41:15.941 --> 41:16.842
What for?

41:16.942 --> 41:18.176
Ask him why he did it.

41:18.276 --> 41:20.145
He did it to show his friends
he was a badass.

41:20.245 --> 41:21.913
Might be good to point out that
decisions have consequences.

41:22.013 --> 41:23.181
You don't think he knows that?

41:23.281 --> 41:24.415
He's a kid from East New York.

41:24.516 --> 41:25.751
And you're a kid
from Westchester.

41:25.851 --> 41:27.118
Andre, sit down.

41:27.218 --> 41:28.720
Thank you, Goody.
IPA?

41:28.820 --> 41:30.155
He's here.
Hey!

41:30.255 --> 41:32.323
What's good? What's good?

41:32.423 --> 41:34.225
You can say congratulations.
We've been celebrating. Yes.

41:34.325 --> 41:36.928
They're the new
owners of Goody's.

41:37.028 --> 41:38.463
You got Goody's?!

41:42.634 --> 41:43.902

41:57.348 --> 41:59.250
after these couple of days
how they'll be in the long run.

41:59.350 --> 42:02.253
Assuming I get a long run. I...
Well, if the last couple of days

42:02.353 --> 42:04.389
are any indication,
I'd say you will.

42:04.489 --> 42:07.025
You know because
of the shooting,

42:07.125 --> 42:08.560
you're gonna have
to go see Psych Services.

42:08.660 --> 42:13.364
Oh, God, I know. They're also
gonna ask me how's my head.

42:14.600 --> 42:16.534
What happened
with the African kid?

42:16.635 --> 42:18.737
I, um... I think
the embassy got him released.

42:18.837 --> 42:22.440
Oh, yeah?
Yeah. Somebody
must've made a call.

42:22.540 --> 42:24.710
That wouldn't have been
something you'd have done

42:24.810 --> 42:26.211
'cause you felt conflicted

42:26.311 --> 42:27.779
about not taking that
shot the first time?
What?!

42:27.879 --> 42:29.881
Are you kidding?
Because as far
as I'm concerned,

42:29.981 --> 42:32.117
you made the right call then,

42:32.217 --> 42:35.086
you made the right call tonight.

42:37.856 --> 42:40.191
Good night, Chief.

42:55.674 --> 42:58.376
Come on, baby. Come on.

43:00.245 --> 43:03.314
Good baby. Good. Good.
