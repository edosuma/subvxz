10 YEARS WE'VE
BEEN MARRIED.

00:54.867 --> 00:56.900

01:00.500 --> 01:05.500
NO, SHE'S THE MOST MISERABLE
WOMAN IN THE WORLD, BELIEVE ME.

01:05.533 --> 01:07.533
YOU'RE PRETTY FIT,
LARRY.

01:07.567 --> 01:10.167

01:10.200 --> 01:13.800

01:28.967 --> 01:32.400
SO, DO I NEED
A TICKET OR ANYTHING ?

01:32.433 --> 01:34.533
I KNOW YOU, LARRY.

01:34.567 --> 01:37.067
YOU DON'T NEED
NO TICKET.

01:37.067 --> 01:39.067
OKAY.

01:45.667 --> 01:49.767
( singing 'El-Kelonenu Hebrew )

01:49.800 --> 01:51.767
LARRY.

01:51.800 --> 01:52.800
RABBI.

01:52.833 --> 01:54.667
WE GOT A CANTER ALREADY,
IT'S OKAY, THOUGH.

01:54.700 --> 01:57.133
WHAT, YOU GOT,
CAN I BE THE NEW CANTER ?

01:57.167 --> 01:58.267
I THINK I CAN DO IT.

01:58.300 --> 01:58.800
CAN YOU DO IT ?

01:58.833 --> 02:00.233
I THINK I COULD.

02:00.267 --> 02:02.167
SO, YOU READY

02:02.200 --> 02:03.533
I'M ALL READY

02:03.567 --> 02:05.667
I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR DOING THIS.

02:05.700 --> 02:06.500
IT'S A PLEASURE,
IT'S A PLEASURE.

02:06.533 --> 02:07.700
YES.

02:07.733 --> 02:09.067
IT SHOULD BE COMPLETELY
PAINLESS, I PROMISE.

02:09.067 --> 02:10.200
OKAY.

02:10.233 --> 02:12.367
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

02:12.400 --> 02:13.433
IS THAT YOU ?

02:13.467 --> 02:17.533
THAT'S, UH,
THAT'S EDDIE SILVERMAN.

02:17.567 --> 02:19.167
HE'S MY, UH,
BROTHER-IN-LAW.

02:19.200 --> 02:22.467
HE, UH...

02:22.500 --> 02:24.467
HE DIED ON
SEPTEMBER 11th.

02:24.500 --> 02:27.667
OH MY GOSH,
OH, I'M SO SORRY.

02:27.700 --> 02:29.167
YEAH, TERRIBLE.

02:29.200 --> 02:31.133
HE WAS
IN THE BUILDING ?

02:31.167 --> 02:36.733
NO, NO, HE WAS UPTOWN
ON 57th STREET.

02:36.767 --> 02:38.267
HE GOT HIT BY
A BIKE MESSENGER.

02:38.300 --> 02:41.467
IT'S AWFUL.

02:41.500 --> 02:43.433
UPTOWN ?

02:43.467 --> 02:46.300
YEAH, YEAH.

02:46.333 --> 02:51.967
BIKE MESSENGER HIT HIM.

02:52.067 --> 02:55.833
HMM.

02:55.867 --> 02:56.933
WHAT A SHAME.

02:56.967 --> 02:59.700
YEAH, YEAH.

02:59.733 --> 03:02.133
WELL, THAT'S, UH...

03:02.167 --> 03:04.233
YEAH ?
HEY, RABBI ?

03:04.267 --> 03:08.833
UM, CAN I DISCUSS A, UH...

03:08.867 --> 03:10.467
PRIVATE MATTER
WITH YOU ?

03:10.500 --> 03:12.467
PLEASE, ANYTHING,
I'M A RABBI,

03:12.500 --> 03:14.433
TELL ME ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO SAY.

03:14.467 --> 03:18.100
WELL, 10 YEARS AGO
BEFORE WE GOT MARRIED.

03:18.133 --> 03:22.500
MY WIFE TOLD ME THAT IF WE
STAYED TOGETHER FOR 10 YEARS,

03:22.533 --> 03:27.200
THAT FOR OUR 10th ANNIVERSARY,
AS A PRESENT TO ME,

03:27.233 --> 03:32.167
SHE WOULD LET ME HAVE
RELATIONS WITH ANOTHER WOMAN.

03:32.200 --> 03:33.367
JUST ONE TIME.

03:33.400 --> 03:36.067
AND, THIS IS LIKE,
THIS IS A GIFT TO YOU ?

03:36.067 --> 03:38.600
IT'S, LIKE, I HAVE TOTAL
PERMISSION TO DO IT.

03:38.633 --> 03:39.667
YEAH ?

03:39.700 --> 03:41.433
SHE'S ALMOST KIND OF
CHALLENGING ME IN A WAY.

03:41.467 --> 03:43.400
IN A KIND OF DEMEANING WAY,
SHE DOESN'T THINK I'M,

03:43.433 --> 03:45.100
YOU KNOW,
SUAVE ENOUGH.

03:45.133 --> 03:46.333
OH REALLY ?

03:46.367 --> 03:48.700
AND I WANT TO, IT'S THE ONLY
OPPORTUNITY I'LL EVER HAVE

03:48.733 --> 03:50.433
FOR THE REST
OF MY LIFE.

03:50.467 --> 03:52.800
I'VE NEVER CHEATED ON HER,
I NEVER WOULD CHEAT.

03:52.833 --> 03:54.167
THIS IS ALL
ON THE UP AND UP.

03:54.200 --> 03:55.500
SO YOU'RE CONFLICTED
ABOUT IT ?

03:55.533 --> 03:58.133
YES, YET I KIND OF,
YOU KNOW, I'LL BE HONEST,

03:58.167 --> 03:59.267
IT WOULD BE NICE.

03:59.300 --> 04:02.433
YOU KNOW WHAT COMES
TO MY MIND, LARRY ?

04:02.467 --> 04:06.067
WHAT COMES TO MY MIND IS
THE STORY OF ABRAHAM AND SARAH.

04:06.067 --> 04:10.500
SARAH COULD NOT CONCEIVE,
AND SARAH SAID TO ABRAHAM,

04:10.533 --> 04:12.567
YOU KNOW, GO INTO
YOUR HANDMAIDEN,

04:12.600 --> 04:16.267
YOU KNOW, HAGAR,
AND HAVE RELATIONS WITH HER.

04:16.300 --> 04:18.633
ABRAHAM'S WIFE
SAID THAT TO HIM ?

04:18.667 --> 04:19.500
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

04:19.533 --> 04:20.833
GET THE HELL
OUTTA HERE !

04:20.867 --> 04:22.433
IT'S RIGHT THERE
IN GENESIS.

04:22.467 --> 04:26.833
I THINK THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT
THAT AS A VERY REAL PRECEDENT.

04:26.867 --> 04:28.900
AND THIS WOMAN'S NEVER
GONNA REPLACE YOUR WIFE,

04:28.933 --> 04:30.500
SHE'S NOT GONNA MEAN
ANYTHING, YOU KNOW...

04:30.533 --> 04:31.733
OF COURSE NOT.

04:31.767 --> 04:33.100
SO, I MEAN, THERE'S NO
DANGER OF THAT, RIGHT ?

04:33.133 --> 04:34.433
NO !

04:34.467 --> 04:37.200
IT'S NOT AN ACT OF LOVE
ANYWAY, IT'S LUST.

04:37.233 --> 04:38.533
SO, YOU KNOW...

04:38.567 --> 04:41.300
LOVE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THAT HAS TO DO WITH SEX ?

04:41.333 --> 04:43.867
YEAH, WELL IT HAS
A LOT TO DO, BUT...

04:43.900 --> 04:45.367
YEAH, FOR SURE.

04:45.400 --> 04:48.933
I WOULD SAY THAT SHE'S GIVING
YOU SOMETHING OUT OF GENEROSITY

04:48.967 --> 04:51.167
AND I THINK YOU
SHOULD PROBABLY

04:51.200 --> 04:54.600
ACCEPT IT IN THAT
SAME SENSE OF GENEROSITY.

04:54.633 --> 04:56.600
AND I'M NOT A BAD PERSON
IF I DO IT ?

04:56.633 --> 04:58.367
NO, NO, YOU'RE NOT
A BAD PERSON IF YOU DO IT.

04:58.400 --> 05:00.667
WELL, I'M A BAD PERSON ANYWAY,
BUT I'M NOT, UH...

05:00.700 --> 05:01.800
I'M NOT AN EXTRA
BAD PERSON ?

05:01.833 --> 05:06.200
NO, IT DOES NOT MAKE YOU
AN EXTRA BAD PERSON.

05:06.233 --> 05:08.567
I'VE GOT TO START COMING
TO TEMPLE MORE OFTEN.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.933
I'M GLAD I COULD
BE HELPFUL WITH THIS.

05:10.967 --> 05:13.233
THANK YOU,
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

05:13.267 --> 05:14.767
YOU'RE VERY WELCOME,
YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.

05:14.800 --> 05:16.700
AND I'LL SEE YOU
TOMORROW NIGHT FOR DINNER ?

05:16.733 --> 05:17.833
OH YES, I'M LOOKING
FORWARD TO THAT,

05:17.867 --> 05:19.233
OH LISTEN, UM, LARRY,

05:19.267 --> 05:21.333
I WAS TALKING
TO A FRIEND OF MINE,

05:21.367 --> 05:26.467
AND, UH, HE'S A SURVIVOR,
AND HE WOULD LOVE TO MEET YOU.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.767
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE,
I MEAN...

05:28.800 --> 05:29.667
FOR ME TO BRING HIM
TO DINNER ?

05:29.700 --> 05:30.867
OF COURSE !

05:30.900 --> 05:32.167
I DON'T WANT TO IMPOSE
OR ANYTHING, I MEAN...

05:32.200 --> 05:33.567
THERE'S NO IMPOSITION AT ALL,
YOU WANT A FRIEND OF YOURS,

05:33.600 --> 05:35.067
BRING HIM OVER,
THAT'S FINE.

05:35.067 --> 05:35.933
OH, THAT'S WONDERFUL.

05:35.967 --> 05:37.167
YEAH, IT'S JUST
GONNA BE MY FAMILY,

05:37.200 --> 05:37.967
THAT'S ALL,
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

05:38.067 --> 05:39.267
HE'LL BE
ABSOLUTELY THRILLED.

05:39.300 --> 05:41.300
ALRIGHT.
OKAY.

05:41.333 --> 05:43.900
GO, ENJOY.

05:43.933 --> 05:45.233
RABBI, THANK YOU.

05:45.267 --> 05:46.600
OKAY.

05:49.700 --> 05:51.867
YES, YOUR HONOR, I DO ADMIT,
FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS

05:51.900 --> 05:53.267
I'VE BEEN A LYING,
DOUBLE-CROSSING, TWO-FACED--

05:53.300 --> 05:59.600
( distant shouting )

05:59.633 --> 06:03.600
JUST STOP IT,
I CAN'T STAND IT ANYMORE,
I CAN'T STAND IT !

06:10.833 --> 06:11.967
HOW'S IT GOING ?

06:12.067 --> 06:13.200
IT'S NOT GOING WELL.

06:13.233 --> 06:15.200
I'M TRYING
TO MEMORIZE THIS STUFF,

06:15.233 --> 06:17.300
THEY'RE MAKING
A RACKET.

06:17.333 --> 06:19.067
I'VE GOT TWO WEEKS.

06:19.067 --> 06:21.433
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

06:21.467 --> 06:22.800
I'M GONNA BE
HUMILIATED.

06:22.833 --> 06:27.900
OH, THE RABBI SAID HE'S
BRINGING A SURVIVOR TOMORROW.

06:27.933 --> 06:29.867
SHOULD I HAVE MY FATHER
BRING HIS FRIEND, SOLLY ?

06:29.900 --> 06:31.767
WHO'S ALSO A SURVIVOR.

06:31.800 --> 06:33.067
YOU KNOW, THE GUY
WITH THE GLASS EYE.

06:33.067 --> 06:33.833
OH, RIGHT.

06:33.867 --> 06:34.967
YEAH.
REMEMBER HIM ?

06:35.067 --> 06:36.500
YOU THINK THAT'S
A GOOD IDEA ?

06:36.533 --> 06:38.967
DO SURVIVORS LIKE
SEEING EACH OTHER ?

06:39.067 --> 06:41.500
DO THEY LIKE TO TALK
ABOUT OLD TIMES OR...

06:41.533 --> 06:44.500
DOES THE SIGHT OF ANOTHER
SURVIVOR DEPRESS THEM ?

06:44.533 --> 06:46.233
I THINK YOU
SHOULD INVITE HIM.

06:46.267 --> 06:47.167
INVITE HIM.

06:47.200 --> 06:48.200
I GUESS IF
I WAS A SURVIVOR,

06:48.233 --> 06:49.600
I'D WANT TO SEE SOMEBODY,
YOU KNOW...

06:49.633 --> 06:51.167
YOU WANT TO SEE SOMEBODY,
YOU HAVE A SHARED EXPERIENCE.

06:51.200 --> 06:54.400
YEAH, TALK ABOUT,
WELL, SEE THAT'S THE THING.

06:54.433 --> 06:56.700
DO THEY WANT TO--
I DON'T KNOW.

06:56.733 --> 07:00.100
HOW ARE YOUR VOWS
COMING ALONG ?

07:00.133 --> 07:03.733
I JUST HAVEN'T HAD THAT MUCH
TIME TO REALLY WORK ON IT YET.

07:03.767 --> 07:05.100
THIS IS IMPORTANT
TO ME, LARRY.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.700
HE WHOLE THING'S GONNA
BE EMBARRASSING ANYWAY,

07:06.733 --> 07:08.300
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
THIS WAS GONNA BE PART
OF THE WHOLE THING,

07:08.333 --> 07:09.700
THAT I WAS GONNA HAVE TO SAY
THIS IN FRONT OF PEOPLE,

07:09.733 --> 07:10.567
I THOUGHT IT WAS...

07:10.600 --> 07:14.533
OKAY, I'M GIVING
YOU A GOOD GIFT.

07:14.567 --> 07:16.233
OKAY.

07:16.267 --> 07:19.233
SO THIS IS WHAT
I HAVE SO FAR.

07:19.267 --> 07:22.433
"MAY I ALWAYS HAVE THE WISDOM
TO LOOK PAST YOUR SHORT COMINGS

07:22.467 --> 07:25.200
"AND APPRECIATE ALL OF
THE GOODNESS YOU POSSESS.

07:25.233 --> 07:29.467
"WE, PROMISE TO CONTINUE LOVING
EACH OTHER UNCONDITIONALLY.

07:29.500 --> 07:31.733
"NOT ONLY THROUGHOUT
THIS LIFETIME,

07:31.767 --> 07:34.233
"BUT AFTER DEATH
THROUGH ALL ETERNITY.

07:34.267 --> 07:35.733
"WE STAND BEFORE YOU--

07:35.767 --> 07:39.067
HUH, WAIT A SECOND.

07:39.067 --> 07:40.667
WHAT ?

07:40.700 --> 07:42.233
WHAT WAS THAT
ABOUT ETERNITY ?

07:42.267 --> 07:46.700
UM, "WE'LL LOVE EACH OTHER,
THROUGHOUT THIS LIFE TIME,

07:46.733 --> 07:48.467
BUT AFTER DEATH
THROUGH ALL ETERNITY."

07:48.500 --> 07:52.333
YOU MEAN THIS IS...

07:52.367 --> 07:56.600
THIS IS CONTINUING
INTO THE AFTERLIFE ?

07:56.633 --> 07:58.867
YEAH, THAT'S THE IDEA.

07:58.900 --> 08:00.767
DO YOU HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH THAT ?

08:00.800 --> 08:05.333
WELL, I...

08:05.367 --> 08:07.100
I THOUGHT THIS
WAS OVER AT DEATH.

08:07.133 --> 08:10.500
I DIDN'T KNOW WE WENT
INTO ETERNITY TOGETHER.

08:10.533 --> 08:13.333
I, UH, ISN'T THAT
WHAT IT SAID IN...

08:13.367 --> 08:14.833
'TILL DEATH DO US PART,
I THOUGHT IT WAS...

08:14.867 --> 08:16.233
DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH ETERNITY ?!

08:16.267 --> 08:17.267
WELL.

08:17.300 --> 08:19.400
WE FINALLY FOUND
EACH OTHER, LARRY,

08:19.433 --> 08:22.567
AND WE'RE CELEBRATING THIS
FOR ALL ETERNITY.

08:22.600 --> 08:26.667
I GUESS I HAD A DIFFERENT
PLAN FOR ETERNITY, I THOUGHT...

08:26.700 --> 08:29.733
I THOUGHT I'D BE SINGLE,
I GUESS.

08:29.767 --> 08:34.733
I'M SORRY, I'M INTERRUPTING
YOUR SINGLE LIFE IN ETERNITY ?

08:34.767 --> 08:37.800
NO, I JUST DIDN'T
REALIZE THAT...

08:37.833 --> 08:41.500
THIS RELATIONSHIP CARRIED
OVER AFTER DEATH, THAT--

08:41.533 --> 08:44.067
WELL, IT DOES,
IT CARRIES OVER !

08:44.067 --> 08:45.200
SO I GUESS I JUST
TOOK THAT FOR GRANTED.

08:45.233 --> 08:48.767
OKAY, DO YOU NOT WANT
TO RENEW OUR VOWS, BECAUSE--

08:48.800 --> 08:52.467
NO, I WANT TO RENEW OUR VOWS
UNTIL, YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T--

08:52.500 --> 08:55.300
CAN WE TAKE OUT
THE ETERNITY PART ?

08:55.333 --> 08:57.067
NO.

09:02.467 --> 09:03.233
OKAY.

09:09.167 --> 09:11.233
( Cheryl )
NICE MEETING YOU.

09:11.267 --> 09:13.900
THIS IS A TREAT,
THIS IS REALLY A TREAT.

09:13.933 --> 09:14.967
THE TREAT IS OURS.

09:15.067 --> 09:16.767
HI.

09:16.800 --> 09:19.167
LOOK AT YOU,
YOU LOOK GREAT.

09:19.200 --> 09:19.867

ON MINUTE IN YOUR LIFE

11:38.333 --> 11:39.933

LOOK, I'M SAYING WE SPENT
42 DAYS TRYING TO SURVIVE,

11:43.567 --> 11:45.300

NO SNACKS.

11:45.333 --> 11:46.800
SNACKS ?

11:46.833 --> 11:48.533
WHAT ARE YOU

11:48.567 --> 11:50.200

11:50.233 --> 11:53.133
FOR A MONTH,
WE ATE NOTHING !
I WENT FROM--

11:53.167 --> 11:54.467

11:54.500 --> 11:55.433
I MEAN, I COULDN'T EVEN WORK OUT
WHEN I WAS OVER THERE.

11:55.467 --> 11:56.700

12:07.500 --> 12:10.900
45 DEGREES BELOW ZERO.

12:10.933 --> 12:11.867
DID YOU GUYS

12:11.900 --> 12:12.700
A BATHROOM ?!

12:12.733 --> 12:13.933
WE DIDN'T HAVE ONE.

12:13.967 --> 12:16.700

12:34.700 --> 12:35.633
TRYING TO GET ME

12:35.667 --> 12:36.600
YOU DON'T KNOW
NOTHING ABOUT SURVIVAL !

12:36.633 --> 12:38.267

13:01.600 --> 13:03.900

13:03.933 --> 13:07.067
THE RABBI WANTS TO START
THE CEREMONY BY NOON.

13:07.100 --> 13:08.500
MY SUIT'S NOT
IN THE DRY CLEANING.

13:08.533 --> 13:09.933
I CAN'T FIND IT.

13:09.967 --> 13:10.967
WHAT ARE YOU

13:11.067 --> 13:12.233

13:37.800 --> 13:39.967

13:49.100 --> 13:49.900
MM-HMM.

13:49.933 --> 13:50.933
IT'S WORTH A SHOT.

13:50.967 --> 13:52.533
OKAY THEN, IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO,

13:52.567 --> 13:55.233

17:31.133 --> 17:32.133
YOU GOTTA DO THAT.

17:32.167 --> 17:33.833
I WOULD THINK IT
MIGHT BE KIND OF FUN

17:33.867 --> 17:35.967
CUTTING THE HOLE WITH HER,
SHARING IT, YOU KNOW ?

17:36.067 --> 17:37.600
( Suzie )
JEFF, WILL YOU BRING
IN THE GROCERIES ?!

17:37.633 --> 17:38.567
I'M COMING !

17:38.600 --> 17:39.133
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

17:39.167 --> 17:40.667
ALRIGHT, BYE.

17:44.933 --> 17:47.533
LARRY.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.933
LOOK, HUH, AREN'T YOU
GLAD I PICKED IT UP ?

17:49.967 --> 17:52.200
MY MOTHER IS VERY
UPSET RIGHT NOW,

17:52.233 --> 17:54.267
AND SHE SAYS SHE'S NOT
COMING TO THE CEREMONY.

17:54.300 --> 17:55.533
WHAT, WHY ?

17:55.567 --> 18:00.233
BECAUSE OF YOUR
SPONGE COMMENT.

18:00.267 --> 18:01.500
WELL, YOU WANT ME
TO GO TALK TO HER ?

18:01.533 --> 18:03.533
YES, I DO !

18:03.567 --> 18:05.367
SHE WAS JUST
TRYING TO HELP OUT.

18:05.400 --> 18:07.333
WELL, THEN SHE SHOULD'VE
GOT THE SPONGE.

18:07.367 --> 18:08.600
WHY DOES SHE WANT SOMEBODY ELSE
TO GET THE SPONGE ?

18:08.633 --> 18:09.867
OH MY GOD.

18:09.900 --> 18:12.167
IF SHE'S JUST TRYING TO
HELP OUT, THEN GET THE SPONGE.

18:14.733 --> 18:15.867
MOM.

18:15.900 --> 18:20.633
MOM, I JUST WANT
TO APOLOGIZE ABOUT THE, UH,

18:20.667 --> 18:24.667
YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE
SPONGE THING.

18:24.700 --> 18:26.400
( clearing throat )

18:26.433 --> 18:29.367
YOU KNOW, WHAT HAPPENED
THAT NIGHT, UH...

18:29.400 --> 18:33.733
BECAUSE OF THE WHOLE,
THE SURVIVOR CONFRONTATION,

18:33.767 --> 18:38.300
IT JUST BROUGHT UP A LOT
OF STUFF ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST,

18:38.333 --> 18:42.333
AND IT'S KIND OF IN MY DNA
AND I WAS VERY FLUMMOXED BY IT.

18:42.367 --> 18:43.767
VERY FLUMMOXED.

18:43.800 --> 18:47.800
YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND,
BUT IF YOU WERE IN MY RELIGION,

18:47.833 --> 18:50.067
WHAT HAPPENED
TO MY PEOPLE,

18:50.100 --> 18:52.067
THINGS CAME OUT THAT
SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SAID.

18:52.100 --> 18:56.900
AND, UM, I CERTAINLY
APOLOGIZE FOR THAT.

18:56.933 --> 18:58.067
THANK YOU.

18:58.100 --> 19:03.967
AND, EVEN THOUGH, YOU KNOW,
YOU WERE KIND OF...

19:04.067 --> 19:05.267
RIGHT BY THE KITCHEN,

19:05.300 --> 19:08.067
YOU WERE THE CLOSEST ONE THERE,
I THOUGHT, WELL...

19:08.067 --> 19:10.067
LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT
HOW YOU DON'T RESPECT ME.

19:10.067 --> 19:11.233
OH, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

19:11.267 --> 19:13.067
I DON'T THINK YOU LIKE ME,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ?

19:13.100 --> 19:14.067
I LIKE EVERYBODY.

19:14.067 --> 19:15.167
I HAVE--

19:15.200 --> 19:18.133
I'M A PEOPLE PERSON,
I LIKE EVERYBODY.

19:18.167 --> 19:19.967
I LOVE PEOPLE.

19:20.067 --> 19:21.567
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

19:21.600 --> 19:23.133
LET'S JUST PUT THIS
BEHIND US, COME ON.

19:23.167 --> 19:25.067
COME ON.

19:25.067 --> 19:25.900
WHAT IS THIS ?

19:25.933 --> 19:28.467
LET'S GO, LET'S GO.

19:28.500 --> 19:29.600
LET'S GO TO CEREMONY,
COME ON.

19:29.633 --> 19:32.400
THIS IS CRAZY,
IT'S SO SILLY, COME ON.

19:32.433 --> 19:36.067
A SPONGE,
YES, COME ON.

19:36.067 --> 19:37.067
NEXT TIME YOU'RE
STANDING BY THE KITCHEN...

19:37.067 --> 19:38.333
GET OUT,
I'LL GO GET MY DRESS.

19:38.367 --> 19:39.400
YOU'LL GET A SPONGE.

19:39.433 --> 19:41.067
YOU'RE STANDING TWO FEET
FROM THE KITCHEN,

19:41.100 --> 19:43.167
YOU GET THE SPONGE
NEXT TIME, SO WHAT.

19:46.333 --> 19:47.933

20:12.067 --> 20:14.267

20:27.467 --> 20:29.167
WHY ARE YOU
MIMICKING ME ?

20:29.200 --> 20:30.667
NO, NO, NO, THE LIGHT
FROM YOUR GLASS EYE,

20:30.700 --> 20:32.433
IT'S REFLECTING ON ME.

20:32.467 --> 20:34.200
YOU, YOU GO
MAKE FUN FOR ME ?

20:34.233 --> 20:35.633
NO, NO, NO.

20:35.667 --> 20:39.633
I DON'T LIKE THIS HERE, I DON'T
WANT TO BE HERE, NO MORE.

20:39.667 --> 20:41.900
HOLD IT,

20:41.933 --> 20:43.567
NO, SOLLY,

21:05.733 --> 21:08.933
AND THEN I WILL PUT
THE GLASS ON THE FLOOR

21:08.967 --> 21:12.067
AND YOU'LL STEP ON IT
AND THAT'LL BE IT.

21:12.067 --> 21:14.067
THAT'S WHEN EVERYBODY
YELLS A MATZO TOFF ?

21:14.067 --> 21:16.100

YIPPY OR SOMETHING ?

21:17.767 --> 21:19.067
OR GOOD LUCK,

21:19.067 --> 21:20.200
HALLELUJAH,

21:20.233 --> 21:22.067
CAN YOU GUYS JUST SAY
MAZEL TOV, PLEASE ?

21:22.067 --> 21:23.133
ANYTHING ELSE, UH ?

21:27.200 --> 21:28.833
YEAH, I'LL TRANSLATE IT,

21:28.867 --> 21:30.067
YOU WANT ME

21:30.067 --> 21:31.733
WE LOVE GOD,

21:35.067 --> 21:37.100
YOU'RE AMAZING GOD,

21:37.133 --> 21:38.433
IT'S A LITTLE
OVERDONE, BUT.

21:38.467 --> 21:42.933
WELL, IT'S A BLESSING,
IT'S MORE ABOUT YOU THAN GOD.

21:42.967 --> 21:44.667
LARRY, I'M SORRY, UM...

21:44.700 --> 21:47.600
YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT
TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT,

21:47.633 --> 21:49.267
BUT ISN'T THERE SOMETHING
YOU CAN DO ABOUT THAT STAIN ?

21:49.300 --> 21:52.133

21:52.167 --> 21:54.167
YEAH, YEAH,

21:54.200 --> 21:56.733
IT'S A GO HOME STAIN,

21:56.767 --> 21:59.400
I MEAN, I JUST, IT'S KIND OF
DISRESPECTFUL, YOU KNOW ?

21:59.433 --> 22:03.700
JUST IN TERMS OF STANDING
IN FRONT OF THE ARC AND...

22:03.733 --> 22:06.133
( Cheryl's Mother )
EXCUSE ME,
DOES ANYBODY HAVE A MINT ?

22:06.167 --> 22:09.600
I GOT A MINT,

22:09.633 --> 22:11.167
DO YOU WANT ME
TO HAND IT TO YOU ?

22:11.200 --> 22:13.067
IT'S LOOSE,
IT'S NOT IN A PACKAGE.

22:13.067 --> 22:14.500
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO PUT
YOUR HAND IN MY POCKET

22:14.533 --> 22:16.067
AND GET IT YOURSELF.

22:16.100 --> 22:17.333
YOU GOT THREE OPTIONS,

22:17.367 --> 22:19.733
YOU CAN DO ONE OF THOSE
TWO THINGS OR YOU CAN REFUSE IT.

22:19.767 --> 22:20.900
THERE YOU GO.

22:20.933 --> 22:22.400
CHERYL, HONEY,
WOULD YOU...

22:22.433 --> 22:24.333
REACH INTO LARRY'S POCKET
FOR AN UNWRAPPED MINT ?

22:24.367 --> 22:25.467

22:32.933 --> 22:36.233
WHAT, "LET'S ROLL" ?

22:36.267 --> 22:37.933
WHAT DID YOU SAY ?

22:37.967 --> 22:41.133
WHAT ?

22:41.167 --> 22:44.267
YOU KNEW THAT MY BROTHER IN LAW
DIED ON SEPTEMBER 11th,

22:44.300 --> 22:45.967
HOW DARE YOU SAY
SOMETHING LIKE THAT ?

22:46.067 --> 22:49.233
WITH ALL DO RESPECT,
WASN'T THAT JUST A COINCIDENCE ?

22:49.267 --> 22:50.333
ALRIGHT,
POOR CHOICE OF WORDS.

22:50.367 --> 22:53.067
WHAT THE HELL KIND OF A,
OH, YOU KNOW--

22:53.067 --> 22:54.833
I DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS !

22:54.867 --> 22:56.133
FORGET IT, FORGET IT.

22:56.167 --> 23:00.733
OH, I DIDN'T KNOW,
THAT IF YOU DIED UPTOWN ON 9-11

23:00.767 --> 23:03.100
THAT IT WAS PART OF IT,
UH, OF THE TRAGEDY, I...

23:03.133 --> 23:04.467
DO I HAVE
TO LISTEN TO THIS ?

23:04.500 --> 23:07.133
DO I HAVE TO GO ON
AND ON ABOUT THIS ?

23:07.167 --> 23:10.333
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT AN UPTOWN
DEATH ON WEST 57th STREET

23:10.367 --> 23:11.833
WAS PART OF
THE TRAGEDY.

23:11.867 --> 23:13.533
ALRIGHT LOOK, I DON'T THINK
I WANT TO DO THIS.

23:13.567 --> 23:16.467
I REALLY DON'T, I MEAN,
YOU LOOK LIKE A SLOB,

23:16.500 --> 23:17.567
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE
TAKING IT SERIOUSLY...

23:17.600 --> 23:18.567
WHAT ?

23:18.600 --> 23:20.067
YOU COULD'VE GONE HOME
WITH THE STAIN...

23:20.100 --> 23:22.167
RABBI, YOU'RE GOING
VERY FAR WITH THIS,
COME ON, NOW.

23:22.200 --> 23:24.467
WE CAME ALL THE WAY
FROM FLORIDA FOR THIS,

23:24.500 --> 23:26.600
AND WE LIKE TO JUST GET IT
OVER WITH IF YOU DON'T MIND.

23:26.633 --> 23:29.433
HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S DOING.

23:29.467 --> 23:31.367
WHAT DO THEY SAY
IN THE BIBLE ?

23:31.400 --> 23:32.433
"HE KNOWS NOT
WHERE OF... "

23:32.467 --> 23:34.267
DON'T TRY
TO QUOTE THE BIBLE,

23:34.300 --> 23:36.067
JUST, DON'T,
DON'T TRY.

23:36.067 --> 23:37.433
LET'S QUIT.

23:37.467 --> 23:38.533
CHERYL,
I'LL DO IT FOR YOU.

23:38.567 --> 23:40.067
THANK YOU, I REALLY
APPRECIATE IT.

23:40.067 --> 23:41.600
HE KNOWS NOT WHERE OF HE,

LET'S GO,
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

23:51.900 --> 23:55.600
AND MAY WE CONTINUE TO LOVE
EACH OTHER UNCONDITIONALLY,

23:55.633 --> 23:57.700
NOT ONLY THROUGHOUT
THIS LIFE TIME,

23:57.733 --> 24:02.200
BUT AFTER DEATH
THROUGH ALL ETERNITY.

24:02.233 --> 24:03.533
THAT'S VERY
MOVING, CHERYL.

24:03.567 --> 24:05.467
THANK YOU.

24:05.500 --> 24:06.967
OKAY, LARRY.

24:16.433 --> 24:17.400
UH...

24:17.433 --> 24:25.067
I'M DRAWING A
BLANK HERE, RABBI.

24:25.067 --> 24:27.400
I DON'T HAVE
THE PAPER.

24:27.433 --> 24:30.967
BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT,
JUST SPEAK FROM YOUR HEART.

24:31.067 --> 24:33.367
JUST SPEAK TO CHERYL,
LOOK INTO HER EYES,

24:33.400 --> 24:35.267
AND IT'LL COME,
THE WORDS WILL COME.

24:39.700 --> 24:43.067
THINGS HAVE BEEN GOOD.

24:43.067 --> 24:47.467
IT'S A VERY GOOD UH,
RELATIONSHIP, 10 YEARS.

24:47.500 --> 24:48.500
PRETTY GOOD.

24:48.533 --> 24:51.100
IT'S PRETTY, PRETTY...

24:51.133 --> 24:54.367
PRETTY, PRETTY GOOD.

24:54.400 --> 25:04.200
AND I AM YOUR DEVOTED SERVANT,
WELL I DON'T KNOW ABOUT SERVANT,

25:04.233 --> 25:07.533
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT A SERVANT,
BUT I'LL CERTAINLY HELP YOU,

25:07.567 --> 25:10.433
IF YOU EVER NEED HELP
WITH ANYTHING, YOU KNOW THAT.

25:10.467 --> 25:12.333
I'M IN THE HOUSE A LOT,

25:12.367 --> 25:14.133
YOU WANT TO OPEN UP
A BRIDGE TABLE OR SOMETHING,

25:14.167 --> 25:15.300
YOU KNOW,
WHATEVER YOU NEED.

25:15.333 --> 25:17.067
I'M NOT
A GREAT HANDYMAN,

25:17.100 --> 25:19.133
AND I'M NOT GOOD
AT MAKING PLANS,

25:19.167 --> 25:20.367
THAT I DON'T
DO VERY WELL.

25:20.400 --> 25:22.900
I HAVE TO ADMIT,
SHE MAKES THE PLANS, YOU KNOW.

25:22.933 --> 25:27.300
SHE MAKES GOOD PLANS,
WE ALWAYS HAVE STUFF TO DO,

25:27.333 --> 25:34.467
AND I WILL LOVE YOU
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.267
'TIL THE DAY I DIE.

25:36.300 --> 25:40.667
I'LL LOVE YOU
UNTIL DEATH.

25:40.700 --> 25:42.167
THAT'S A
PRETTY GOOD THING.

25:42.200 --> 25:44.567
NOT THAT MANY
WOMEN HAVE THAT.

25:44.600 --> 25:46.767
RIGHT NOW,
'TIL THE DAY I DIE,

25:46.800 --> 25:49.500
THERE WILL NEVER BE
ANY OTHER WOMAN 'TIL DEATH.

25:49.533 --> 25:51.067
AND, YOU KNOW,
WE DON'T, YOU KNOW,

25:51.067 --> 25:52.900
AFTER DEATH WHO KNOWS

YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT--

25:55.733 --> 25:59.200
I PROMISE TO LOVE YOU
