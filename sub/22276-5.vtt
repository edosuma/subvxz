AARON MAHNKE: On a cold night
in the late fifth century,

00:19.353 --> 00:20.938
a man named Patricius

00:20.980 --> 00:23.357
walked down a lonely road in Ireland.

00:27.445 --> 00:29.488
Patricius was on a mission...

00:30.865 --> 00:32.533
to spread the Gospel.

00:36.328 --> 00:39.832
But the road he walked was never easy.

00:44.503 --> 00:46.380
Fifth Century pagans

00:46.422 --> 00:49.842
weren't always receptive
to the teachings of Christ,

00:49.884 --> 00:52.344
especially in the village of Ossory.

- [ANIMAL GROWLING]
- [CHAINS CLANKING]

00:56.140 --> 00:57.850
That's because

00:57.892 --> 01:01.312
the people of Ossory already had a god.

01:03.439 --> 01:05.649
They worshiped the wolf.

01:19.371 --> 01:21.415
[HOWLING]

01:21.457 --> 01:23.501
Patricius' message held no power

01:23.542 --> 01:25.252
for the people of Ossory.

01:27.046 --> 01:30.132
And their leader had no
use for his salvation.

But there was a time when the werewolf

03:47.061 --> 03:49.355
was believed to be all too real.

03:51.148 --> 03:53.734
In the 15th and 16th centuries,

03:53.776 --> 03:55.486
Europe was on fire

03:55.527 --> 03:57.613

03:57.655 --> 04:01.825
Tens of thousands were
accused of being wolf-men.

04:03.285 --> 04:05.245
The people of Bedburg believed

04:05.287 --> 04:08.540
they were being hunted by
one of those werewolves.

[SNARLING]

05:52.061 --> 05:54.605
It may sound strange
that they really thought

05:54.646 --> 05:56.815
a werewolf was stalking them.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.570
But we do know that
wolf-like humans exist.

06:03.238 --> 06:06.200
A condition known as hypertrichosis...

06:06.241 --> 06:08.702
it causes excessive hair growth.

06:08.744 --> 06:10.704
But the only thing out of control

06:10.746 --> 06:12.414
about the people afflicted

06:12.456 --> 06:14.666
is their body hair, not their behavior.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.711
There is, however, a
rare psychiatric condition

06:17.753 --> 06:19.546
called clinical lycanthropy

06:19.588 --> 06:21.215
that causes people to believe

06:21.256 --> 06:23.217
they've turned into animals.

06:23.258 --> 06:25.302
This delusion can manifest itself

06:25.344 --> 06:27.137
through animal-like behavior

06:27.179 --> 06:29.306
such as howling and clawing.

06:32.309 --> 06:34.061
In Northern Europe

06:34.103 --> 06:36.522
around the time of
the events in Bedburg,

06:36.563 --> 06:39.316
rumors began circulating of men

06:39.358 --> 06:41.693
who did more than behave like wolves,

06:41.735 --> 06:43.570
they became wolves.

06:44.988 --> 06:46.657
These wolf-men were said

06:46.698 --> 06:48.367
to attack unsuspecting victims

06:48.408 --> 06:50.494
as they walked alone in the woods.

06:52.538 --> 06:54.373
They'd mount their backs,

06:54.414 --> 06:56.583
lick their mouths and faces,

06:56.625 --> 06:58.127
and then devour them.

07:02.214 --> 07:03.799
According to legend,

07:03.841 --> 07:06.677

07:06.718 --> 07:09.513
werewolves didn't have tails

07:09.555 --> 07:12.891
because they were just men, cursed men.

07:14.560 --> 07:16.436
One of the oldest werewolf legends

07:16.478 --> 07:18.939
can be traced back to its first telling,

07:18.981 --> 07:20.607
2,000 years ago,

07:20.649 --> 07:23.193
somewhere between Europe
and the Middle East.

07:23.235 --> 07:25.195
It's a story told to children

07:25.237 --> 07:28.031
about a creature that
devours a family...

07:28.073 --> 07:29.533
a grandmother...

07:31.034 --> 07:33.412
and a little girl in a red hood.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.666
In some versions,

07:37.708 --> 07:39.710
the wolf tricks the
girl into eating a meal

07:39.751 --> 07:42.379
made of her grandmother's corpse

Below the head they carved

It's not so difficult to understand

32:40.876 --> 32:42.628

They believed a werewolf
had been preying on them.

In a final act,

32:48.133 --> 32:50.010
they burned his body to ash

32:50.052 --> 32:52.554
so he couldn't rise again.

It wasn't just revenge they were after.
