07:09.263 --> 07:11.897

doing your part in the house.

07:11.965 --> 07:14.199
- Basically, if I bang him,
he'll mow the lawn?

07:14.268 --> 07:15.400
- Probably.

07:15.469 --> 07:18.970
- If you blow, I'll mow.
[laughter]

07:19.039 --> 07:20.272

07:30.751 --> 07:31.817
- 'Cause he doesn't
make anything--

07:31.885 --> 07:33.084
- Always an excuse.
Guess where I am?

07:33.153 --> 07:34.753
- You don't.
- I'm home alone.

07:34.822 --> 07:36.721
I feel left out
with everything.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.156
You're constantly
yelling at me...

07:38.225 --> 07:41.026
- Understandable.
- Bossing me around.

07:41.094 --> 07:42.894
That also ties into
the 50/50 relationship thing

07:42.963 --> 07:45.197
where I feel like this
relationship's more like 90/10.

07:45.265 --> 07:46.932
- So you say you're being
talked down to?

07:47.000 --> 07:48.366
- Yes.

07:48.435 --> 07:50.602
<i> - I have never seen Chris</i>
<i> this vulnerable before,</i>

07:50.671 --> 07:52.838
but I believe
he really does love Angelina.

07:52.906 --> 07:54.172
You have to be careful
with the tone.

07:54.241 --> 07:55.373
- Okay.

07:55.442 --> 07:56.374
- It's not what you say,
it's how you say it.

07:56.443 --> 07:57.809
- Yes.

07:57.878 --> 07:59.277
- But they're both constantly
doing the wrong things.

07:59.346 --> 08:01.112
- And then another thing, too,

08:01.181 --> 08:04.015
buying the house, I think
it was you and your mother.

08:04.084 --> 08:05.717
When I spoke to your mother
that day on the phone,

08:05.786 --> 08:08.753
she said,
"Maybe if I buy the house,

08:08.822 --> 08:10.755
if I ever want to kick you out,
I can just kick you out."

08:10.824 --> 08:12.657
- No, that's not the way
it's phrased, no.

08:12.726 --> 08:13.925
- But I'm like,

08:13.994 --> 08:15.260
"Why the [bleep]
are we going in it like that?"

08:15.329 --> 08:17.596
Going into a house with that
in my brain is not good.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.030
- No. It's not.
- No, no.

08:19.099 --> 08:20.966
You're forecasting
or projecting

08:21.034 --> 08:22.667
that someone's gonna
kick someone out.

08:22.736 --> 08:24.236
No.
You don't want any of that.

08:24.304 --> 08:26.037
- That's terrible.
- Yeah, that's terrible.

08:26.106 --> 08:29.508
- For Chris to say, "Well,
how about you buy this house,

08:29.576 --> 08:31.610
<i> just in case</i>
<i> you'll kick me out?"</i>

08:31.678 --> 08:34.112
That puts a bad taste
in my mouth,

08:34.181 --> 08:36.581
because that's like
basically saying to your wife,

08:36.650 --> 08:37.983
<i> "I know that in the future,</i>

08:38.051 --> 08:39.417
<i> "our marriage and our</i>
<i> relationship--</i>

08:39.486 --> 08:40.719
<i> it's not gonna work out."</i>

08:40.787 --> 08:43.054
- Okay. Now can I explain me?
- Go ahead.

08:43.123 --> 08:45.323
- I was thinking of it
as a fair thing for you,

08:45.392 --> 08:47.225
since you were the one
that was putting more into it.

08:47.294 --> 08:48.760
- So a misconception.
- Yeah.

08:48.829 --> 08:51.196
But that's what usually happens
when someone says something,

08:51.265 --> 08:53.298
especially someone you love

08:53.367 --> 08:54.833
and then you don't
talk about it.

08:54.902 --> 08:55.834
- Mm-hmm.

08:55.903 --> 08:56.902
- Nine times out of ten,

08:56.970 --> 08:58.537
it's literally
a miscommunication

08:58.605 --> 09:00.071

something different.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.072

<i> Marriage is not easy.</i>

09:02.342 --> 09:03.475

ever has been.

09:13.020 --> 09:15.587

for this couple,

24:17.323 --> 24:19.290
Here's the thing.
I can't be there.

24:19.358 --> 24:21.225
I'm celebrating
my anniversary tonight with...

24:21.294 --> 24:22.660
- True. It is today.
Happy anniversary.

24:22.728 --> 24:24.228
- A special date night with me
and my wife, thank you,

24:24.297 --> 24:27.097
but I'm gonna need you guys
to execute the distraction.

24:27.166 --> 24:28.165
- How are we gonna
keep her busy?

24:28.234 --> 24:29.433
- Anything.

24:29.502 --> 24:30.901
- Got any Botox laying around?
- Oh, my God.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.336
- Oh, my God.

24:32.405 --> 24:34.538
<i> Hopefully, this plan sticks.</i>

24:34.607 --> 24:36.307
This is
a very important ceremony.

24:36.375 --> 24:38.509
I gotta get ready
for anniversary date night...

24:38.578 --> 24:39.510
- All right.
- With me and the wife.

24:39.579 --> 24:40.744
- Well enjoy.
- See you later.

24:40.813 --> 24:41.812
- All right, guys.

24:41.881 --> 24:43.647
We must execute
the distraction.

24:43.716 --> 24:46.350
- Shh. Shh. Shh.
They're coming. They're coming.

24:46.419 --> 24:47.918
- Jenni!
- Yeah?

24:47.987 --> 24:49.553
- Do you want to get a drink?
<i> I have a two-year-old</i>

24:49.622 --> 24:50.821
<i> I have to keep occupied,</i>

24:50.890 --> 24:52.389
so this is right up my alley.

24:52.458 --> 24:54.525
- I want a drink.
- Do you want to a dri--get a--

24:54.594 --> 24:55.593
- Sure.
Do you want to do shots?

24:55.661 --> 24:56.827
- Do you want to do
a drink with me?

24:56.896 --> 24:57.828
- Oh, my God.

24:57.897 --> 24:59.096
- Oh, my gosh.
I'll be back.

24:59.165 --> 25:00.998
I'm gonna go check on my kids.

25:01.067 --> 25:02.066
- Oh, no.

25:02.134 --> 25:03.067
Hey!

25:03.135 --> 25:04.168
- Deena wants to try tequila.

25:04.237 --> 25:05.402
- Yes!
- No, I do not.

25:05.471 --> 25:06.704
No, I do not.
Come on.

25:06.772 --> 25:07.705
- Let's get her tequila.

25:07.773 --> 25:08.706
- All right. Let's go.
Tequila.

25:08.774 --> 25:10.341
- Let's go, girl.
Come on.

25:10.409 --> 25:11.642
- All day, every day.
- Go, D.

25:11.711 --> 25:13.611
- Let's pass over
to the dark side.

25:13.679 --> 25:15.412
- Go, D. Go, D. Go, D.
- I don't drink tequila!

25:15.481 --> 25:17.181
Oh, my God, my lower back.

25:18.551 --> 25:19.650
- That worked pretty easily.

25:19.719 --> 25:22.286
- Operation Distraction
is a go.

25:22.622 --> 25:25.055
- We need two tequilas.

25:26.292 --> 25:28.559
- Listen, I want to do
something special

25:28.628 --> 25:30.327
with us for Mom.

25:31.030 --> 25:32.496
- Oh, okay.

25:32.565 --> 25:34.632
- But I need you to keep it
a secret until it's time, okay?

25:34.700 --> 25:35.866
- Okay.

25:35.935 --> 25:36.967
- Let's go on a walk
real quick, all right?

25:37.036 --> 25:38.002
- All right.

25:38.070 --> 25:39.503
- Excuse me.
Can you come here?

25:39.572 --> 25:40.971
- Me? Me?
- Yeah.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.107
- She just scratched me.
- I didn't mean to.

25:43.175 --> 25:45.109
- Are you trying to keep me
from something?

25:45.177 --> 25:47.344
both: No.
- I...

25:47.413 --> 25:50.281
- I have a surprise for Mom.

25:50.349 --> 25:51.649
- It's for Mom, dude.

25:51.717 --> 25:54.184
You guys will get
your surprises a different day.

25:54.754 --> 25:55.886
- Okay.
- So--

25:59.325 --> 26:00.391
- I just want to hang out
with you.

26:00.459 --> 26:01.725
I feel like I haven't seen you.

26:01.794 --> 26:03.661
- How about I do--
- Mm-mm.

26:03.729 --> 26:04.995
- All right.
Why don't you--

26:05.064 --> 26:06.363
- You're keeping me
from something.

26:06.432 --> 26:08.232
- No, I'm not.
- I can tell when you're--

26:08.301 --> 26:09.700
- No, I'm not.

26:09.769 --> 26:11.335
How am I gonna keep
Jenni occupied?

26:11.404 --> 26:13.571
She's, like, the most
suspicious person ever.

26:13.639 --> 26:15.372
- You're the worst liar ever!
- No.

26:15.441 --> 26:16.507
My back hurts.

26:16.576 --> 26:17.875
- She just said her back hurts.

26:17.944 --> 26:18.976
- I know there's
something going.

26:19.045 --> 26:20.210
There's something
happening right now,

26:20.279 --> 26:21.545
and I'm a little paranoid.

26:21.614 --> 26:23.380
- Oh, and also Vinny has
to tell you something.

26:23.449 --> 26:25.049
- Oh, no.

26:25.117 --> 26:26.617
- Vinny, you have
to tell her something.

26:26.686 --> 26:28.819
- Do you see how I'm wearing
this for the hotel?

26:28.888 --> 26:31.055
This is our room key.
- Yeah. Yeah.

26:31.123 --> 26:34.325
- I got us something that we're
gonna share together, for Mom.

26:35.061 --> 26:37.094
- Here, come over here.

26:37.163 --> 26:38.329
- Oh, my.

26:38.397 --> 26:41.432
- No, I just wanted to say
thank you...

26:41.500 --> 26:43.701
just for being you.

26:43.769 --> 26:46.103
- What is all this stalling?
- No, no, no.

26:46.172 --> 26:49.173
Distracting somebody
is a lot harder than it sounds,

26:49.241 --> 26:51.041
especially when
that person knows

26:51.110 --> 26:52.843
that they're being distracted.

26:52.912 --> 26:54.745
I love you.

26:54.814 --> 26:56.647
<i> I think I'm doing a good job.</i>

26:56.716 --> 26:58.916
She's too busy laughing
in my face

26:58.985 --> 27:02.219
at what I'm saying to think
about what 24 is doing.

27:02.288 --> 27:03.687
- What is happening?

27:03.756 --> 27:05.889
- No. I love you. No.

27:07.460 --> 27:10.127
- I have bracelets.

27:10.196 --> 27:12.830
They're for us three,

27:12.898 --> 27:14.031
and we're gonna give
one to Mom.

27:14.100 --> 27:15.299
Here, you can look at it.

27:15.368 --> 27:17.167
So you see that symbol
on the front?

27:17.703 --> 27:20.237
- Mm-hmm.
- It goes like this.

27:20.306 --> 27:22.906
It never breaks.
The ring never breaks.

27:22.975 --> 27:23.941
- Oh.
- See that?

27:24.010 --> 27:25.142
- Mm-hmm.

27:25.211 --> 27:26.543
- 'Cause that's
an infinity sign,

27:26.612 --> 27:29.313
so I thought I would get these
for us and our family.

27:29.382 --> 27:31.682
- Yeah.
- And we can all wear them,

27:31.751 --> 27:33.851
and that means--that symbolizes

27:33.919 --> 27:35.786
that we will always
go on forever,

27:35.855 --> 27:37.454
'cause we all love each other.

27:37.523 --> 27:40.658
- Aww!
- So here's what I thought.

27:40.726 --> 27:42.726
Please keep it a secret
until it's time.

27:42.795 --> 27:43.761
- Okay.

27:43.829 --> 27:44.828
- What did you say you wanted

27:44.897 --> 27:45.963
to talk to me about?

27:46.032 --> 27:48.198
- Let's do a tequila shot.
- Goodbye!

27:48.267 --> 27:49.867

27:49.935 --> 27:51.101

- Wait. No. No.

- Jenni! I'm doing tequila.

27:52.838 --> 27:53.971
I'm drinking it.
I'm drinking tequila.

27:54.040 --> 27:55.039
- What is wrong with you?

27:55.107 --> 27:56.073
- I'm drinking tequila
right now.

27:56.142 --> 27:57.875
- This is it.
This is my end.

27:57.943 --> 28:00.044

39:57.596 --> 39:59.329
that you guys are not friends.

39:59.398 --> 40:01.598
You guys are family.

So tomorrow's a big day.

40:04.169 --> 40:06.035
It's a beach day.
- Oh, it's a beach day?

40:06.104 --> 40:08.271
- Tomorrow's a beach day.
- Oh, nice.

40:08.340 --> 40:09.806
- Right after I ate
all this food?

40:09.875 --> 40:11.207
- Yeah. Yeah. I know, right?

40:11.276 --> 40:12.542
- Is your mosquito bite coming?

40:12.611 --> 40:14.344
- Listen. Bill Gates--

40:14.413 --> 40:15.545
- Honey. Honey.

40:15.614 --> 40:16.780
- Okay, he...

40:16.848 --> 40:18.214

To a great first day.

40:22.087 --> 40:23.853
- Double shot at love.

40:23.922 --> 40:25.422
- Please. Yeah.

40:25.490 --> 40:27.056
- Mike's not functioning.
- No.

40:27.125 --> 40:28.291
- Well, he's shot.
- Anyway--

40:28.360 --> 40:29.926

five-month-old

40:29.995 --> 40:31.628
to deal with, okay?

40:31.696 --> 40:34.497
24-hours-a-day human,
so we have to go to bed.

40:34.566 --> 40:36.800
You also have a baby to go to.

40:36.868 --> 40:38.001
- I'm not pushing it,

40:38.069 --> 40:39.636
because I brought people
to take care of him.

40:39.704 --> 40:41.771
That's why, okay?
So, like, please.
