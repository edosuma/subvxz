WEBVTT

00:20.521 --> 00:25.059
We stand today at the threshold
of a great event.

00:25.159 --> 00:30.231
Both in the life of the United Nations
and in the life of mankind.

00:30.331 --> 00:35.469
This universal declaration
of human rights may well become

00:35.569 --> 00:39.574
the international Magna Carta
of all men everywhere.

00:43.844 --> 00:47.417
You only meet your once-in-a-lifetime friend
once in a lifetime,

00:47.782 --> 00:49.989
and I had to travel a long way
to realize that.

00:50.718 --> 00:53.426
That October,
I'd just turned 15 years old.

00:53.621 --> 00:56.261
My mother was dead,
and I thought it was my fault.

00:56.757 --> 00:59.033
Home was the last place I wanted to be.

00:59.627 --> 01:01.436
I wanted it to swallow me up.

01:02.550 --> 01:04.532
- But she wouldn't let it.
- Thank goodness you're home.

01:04.632 --> 01:06.567
Can I run through my speech
with you one more time?

01:06.667 --> 01:08.769
I'm tired of hearing that stupid speech.

01:08.869 --> 01:14.208
I just want to make sure I've memorized it
and left nothing out when I introduce her.

01:14.308 --> 01:15.343
And I'm nervous.

01:15.443 --> 01:17.645
I'm sure Mrs. Roosevelt won't mind
if you leave something out.

01:17.745 --> 01:19.447
You should come with me
to hear Mrs. Roosevelt.

01:19.547 --> 01:23.718
You're the future of this country.
You and Max the Wax, God forbid.

01:23.818 --> 01:25.419
I mean, things are hard for women today.

01:25.519 --> 01:27.588
When are you gonna learn
that women need to stick together?

01:27.688 --> 01:30.524
I stick together. Me and Max the Wax
are going to the movies later to see Gidget.

01:30.624 --> 01:33.227
Would you at least pick Henry up
from school so that I'm not late?

01:33.327 --> 01:34.996
No! Let the little wiener walk. I had to.

01:35.096 --> 01:39.670
Thanks a lot. Dinner is in the oven,
make a vegetable and I don't mean corn.

01:52.279 --> 01:56.550
One of the most famous stars
in Hollywood history is dead at 36.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.986
Marilyn Monroe was found dead in bed

01:59.086 --> 02:01.422
under circumstances
that were in tragic contrast

02:01.522 --> 02:04.225
to her glamorous career as a comic talent.

02:04.325 --> 02:07.306
On the surface, she seemed to have
such a sensible mind...

02:25.579 --> 02:27.252
She was fate because of me.

02:28.149 --> 02:29.594
She was hit by a car.

03:08.789 --> 03:10.928
My mother loved Eleanor Roosevelt.

03:11.559 --> 03:14.563
She said she was the greatest First Lady
our country ever had.

03:30.211 --> 03:32.246
Women gotta stick together,
don't you know?

03:32.346 --> 03:34.749
- Why can't we have corn?
- No more corn.

03:34.849 --> 03:36.351
Is Dad gonna eat?

03:36.784 --> 03:38.195
I don't know. He's busy.

03:38.352 --> 03:41.522
He's always busy.
I wish he'd be a pumpkin man again.

03:41.622 --> 03:44.825
We're not pumpkin people no more
because Mom's gone,

03:44.925 --> 03:47.428
and he don't give a flip
about pumpkins no more.

03:47.528 --> 03:50.731
Heck, I don't think he'd even notice
if one of us went missing.

03:50.831 --> 03:54.779
This don't taste like sloppy joe.
I wish Mom could make it.

03:54.935 --> 03:57.745
It's Mom's same recipe,
so quit complaining.

03:58.372 --> 03:59.774
- And we're still a family.
- I'm itchy.

03:59.874 --> 04:00.875
Me, too.

04:02.776 --> 04:04.517
It's because you have the chicken pox.

04:04.979 --> 04:06.549
I'm next, ain't I?

04:07.348 --> 04:08.418
Warren!

04:10.718 --> 04:12.755
Marilyn, rest in peace.

04:13.454 --> 04:14.865
And RIP Jesus.

04:17.458 --> 04:18.493
Elvis?

04:18.858 --> 04:20.194
You chewed up my letter!

04:20.293 --> 04:22.029
- I'm gonna have a serious talk with you...
- "Dear Eleanor...

04:22.129 --> 04:23.464
- ...when I get home.
- "...my name is Maxine Wax,

04:23.564 --> 04:24.632
"and I'm 15 years old.

04:24.732 --> 04:27.975
"You may have already heard of me
as my family is very famous."

04:28.235 --> 04:29.336
Keep reading.

04:29.436 --> 04:32.239
"I'm writing to you because my best friend
Ellie has gone berserk

04:32.339 --> 04:35.209
"and practically lost her mind.

04:35.309 --> 04:38.245
"Her mom died this last summer,
and I know it would mean a lot to her

04:38.345 --> 04:40.214
"if she could meet you
and get some words of encouragement

04:40.314 --> 04:41.749
- "from a real trooper."
- Okay, skip to the end.

04:41.849 --> 04:42.850
Right there, Billy.

04:42.950 --> 04:45.286
"Sincerely, sincerely, Maxine Wax.

04:45.386 --> 04:46.854
"P.S. You're probably a very busy person.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.823
"You can just send her
an autographed picture of yourself

04:48.923 --> 04:50.357
"because that would be neat, too.

04:50.457 --> 04:51.697
"Thanks, Mrs. Roosevelt."

04:54.428 --> 04:55.463
I liked maps.

04:55.829 --> 04:58.933
I could look at the State
Farm Road Atlas for hours.

04:59.033 --> 05:02.136
Opening it gave you a sense of adventure,
and that everything was possible.

05:02.236 --> 05:03.237
Ellie!

05:03.337 --> 05:05.306
And that you could plot
a new life for yourself.

05:05.406 --> 05:07.613
And the red-lined highways
would take you there.

05:08.442 --> 05:10.012
Ellie, are you up there?

05:12.479 --> 05:14.548
Max the Wax and I are going
to Dairy Deluxe! Wanna come?

05:14.648 --> 05:15.752
Yeah, hold on.

05:18.485 --> 05:19.623
Hi, Annabell.

05:20.521 --> 05:21.522
Say...

05:21.789 --> 05:22.893
Say, "Hey, Max."

05:24.558 --> 05:25.798
Okay.

05:25.960 --> 05:27.303
Come here.

05:27.428 --> 05:28.771
Don't fall. Don't fall.

05:32.366 --> 05:34.502
Hey, look out for her.

05:34.602 --> 05:36.604
- What, come on!
- You promised!

05:50.484 --> 05:53.954
Hey, did you guys know that Manteca
is the pumpkin capital of the world?

05:55.022 --> 05:58.333
I'm serious. Without Manteca
there wouldn't even be a Halloween.

05:58.492 --> 06:01.595
- Hey, Billy.
- Don't. Don't start with that again.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.631
- Billy!
- You guys know that

06:03.731 --> 06:05.802
- I do not like that, Max!
- Billy!

06:09.236 --> 06:11.443
There's your dad, sitting in his truck
staring at nothing again.

06:14.074 --> 06:16.076
Come on, let's go.

06:20.347 --> 06:23.817
Saturdays, we confessed.
Max loved to confess.

06:23.917 --> 06:26.754
One time she was in there
for two whole hours.

06:26.854 --> 06:30.291
But I knew my sin was so bad,
no amount of Hail Marys could save me.

06:30.391 --> 06:31.461
You're up.

06:35.396 --> 06:39.469
I got nine Our Fathers, 10 Hail Marys
and six Acts of Contrition.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.071
And they want to see me again next week.

06:42.636 --> 06:46.607
After confession, we'd go to the movies
with our cleansed souls.

06:46.707 --> 06:47.908
We were good for the first two minutes,

06:48.008 --> 06:50.578
and then impure thoughts
about Warren Beatty would creep in.

06:50.678 --> 06:51.713
We're going to hell.

06:54.181 --> 06:56.984
I understand,
that's probably a good idea. Hi.

06:57.084 --> 06:59.053
I'll give you $250. That's more than fair.

06:59.153 --> 07:00.621
$250?

07:00.721 --> 07:03.624
I'm sure it is fair,
but Carolina's piano is not for sale.

07:03.724 --> 07:06.034
- $300.
- $300.

07:06.160 --> 07:08.362
- Why is your mouth blue, son?
- Don't know, sir.

07:08.462 --> 07:11.098
- Jack, go wash your face, okay?
- I did, and it don't come off.

07:11.198 --> 07:14.236
The thing is, we're gonna keep
the piano, all right?

07:24.812 --> 07:26.416
Come here, come on.

07:27.681 --> 07:30.287
Oh, my Lord, me, too. Come here.

07:30.751 --> 07:31.785
You're hot.

07:31.885 --> 07:32.989
It's all right.

07:33.554 --> 07:35.556
Come on.

07:38.025 --> 07:39.936
Let's go find him, come on.

07:57.745 --> 07:58.780
Nothing.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.890
Couple of little ladies headed your way.

08:04.752 --> 08:05.822
Shit.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.258
Third one's got it.
Fourth one's gonna get it.

08:08.389 --> 08:10.057
- Get what?
- Chicken pox.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.825
I'm not gonna get it
because I already had it.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.894
But now she's running a fever
and she won't stop crying,

08:13.994 --> 08:16.130
and somebody's got to take her temperature
and I'm not gonna do it.

08:16.230 --> 08:17.231
Why not?

08:17.598 --> 08:19.867
Because it goes up her butt, that's why.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.935
She needs to go to a doctor,
but I'm not grown-up

08:22.035 --> 08:24.845
and I'm not her parent so you gotta do it,

08:25.739 --> 08:27.013
or you can do this.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.476
- Okay.
- You are on your own, buddy.

08:29.576 --> 08:30.748
I'll be in the car.

08:31.879 --> 08:33.756
I'm gonna concede this game.

08:35.515 --> 08:39.123
Dr. Henning to pediatrics.
Dr. Henning to pediatrics, please.

08:41.255 --> 08:43.496
Hi. Thank you.

08:43.823 --> 08:45.993
Give her baby aspirin
until her fever reduces.

08:46.093 --> 08:47.094
Okay.

08:49.062 --> 08:50.700
She don't look too bad.

09:00.641 --> 09:03.588
- I'm trying, Ellie.
- Not hard enough, Dad.

09:25.032 --> 09:26.978
- She still sleeping?
- Yeah.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.069
All the kids are home sick today,

09:29.169 --> 09:31.205
so you're gonna have to stay here
and take care of them.

09:31.305 --> 09:33.182
I have a big history test I can't miss.

09:33.640 --> 09:35.085
Okay, well, I'll...

09:35.576 --> 09:37.055
I'll call Grandma and...

09:48.789 --> 09:50.657
There's a party at Tom's tonight.

09:50.757 --> 09:52.793
- You want to come over?
- No, no, daddy-o.

09:52.893 --> 09:57.398
I'm going to Motorcycle Rita's
to get drunk and have sex and do drugs.

09:57.498 --> 09:59.566
No doll's called Motorcycle Rita.

09:59.666 --> 10:02.569
Yes, there is. And that's where
Marijuana Millie's going tonight.

10:02.669 --> 10:04.004
No doll's named Marijuana.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.572
Okay, maybe not your dolls,

10:05.672 --> 10:08.809
but my dolls do a lot of interesting things
yours would never do.

10:08.909 --> 10:12.356
Well, my dolls like to go camping
all the time at Lake Don Pedro.

10:12.613 --> 10:13.747
And eat tacos and swim.

10:13.847 --> 10:17.192
Who cares about tacos and Lake Don Pedro?

10:18.452 --> 10:20.193
What's been up with you lately?

10:21.121 --> 10:23.257
I thought we were playing dolls
and having fun and stuff like that,

10:23.357 --> 10:25.860
and all of a sudden
your doll is out of control.

10:27.261 --> 10:29.263
- Millie used to own a bakery.
- She sold it.

10:29.363 --> 10:31.001
Can't be naked and own a bakery.

10:31.999 --> 10:33.034
I'm going home.

10:34.868 --> 10:35.969
Wait.

10:36.069 --> 10:37.905
I thought we were gonna make s'mores,

10:38.005 --> 10:41.043
and camp out in the backyard with the
Little Elvis and play records all night long.

10:41.275 --> 10:43.811
It's not gonna be any fun
if it's just me and him.

10:43.911 --> 10:46.213
Aren't we a little old
to be playing with dolls?

10:46.313 --> 10:48.657
Yeah, that'll be the day.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.462
I'll see you later.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.069
Come on. Ellie's all right.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.938
You have no idea how bad it is, Billy.

11:11.038 --> 11:13.607
She's no fun anymore.
She doesn't even want to play dolls.

11:13.707 --> 11:15.108
You guys still play dolls?

11:15.208 --> 11:16.643
Stop giving me the business.

11:16.743 --> 11:20.418
How would an autographed picture
of Mrs. Roosevelt make Ellie be fun again?

11:20.814 --> 11:21.918
It just would.

11:22.749 --> 11:25.686
Billy, I'm 15 years old, okay?

11:25.786 --> 11:29.393
Fifteen is the age when girls start
to lose it and Ellie's almost 16.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.191
- So what do you think that means?
- I really...

11:31.291 --> 11:33.328
- I really have no idea.
- Of course, you're a boy.

11:34.061 --> 11:37.030
Are you going
to the Rock Around the Clock hop?

11:37.130 --> 11:40.134
If no other fellow has asked you to go,
we could go together.

11:41.068 --> 11:43.804
I mean, I'm sure... I'm sure
that you have a lot of guys you like, so.

11:43.904 --> 11:46.817
Listen, Billy,
'cause I'm only gonna say this once.

11:47.107 --> 11:51.283
I know you think us girls think about
you guys all the time, but we don't.

11:51.712 --> 11:52.813
Okay?

11:52.913 --> 11:54.415
So I'll see you soon.

11:54.848 --> 11:57.885
And next time, can I have my cone swirled
instead of just plain vanilla?

11:57.985 --> 11:59.720
And can you dip it, too, please?

11:59.820 --> 12:01.766
- Yeah, sure.
- Au revoir.

12:09.763 --> 12:10.935
"Dear Max,

12:11.865 --> 12:14.004
"thank you so much for your letter.

12:14.901 --> 12:17.507
"At the moment,
I'm out of pictures of myself.

12:18.839 --> 12:20.477
"But I was thinking

12:20.874 --> 12:23.744
"maybe someday you and your friend Ellie

12:23.844 --> 12:26.347
"can come to visit me
at my home in New York.

12:28.181 --> 12:30.252
"Sincerely, Eleanor Roosevelt."

12:43.330 --> 12:45.833
Now you look like you came from New York.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.744
- Don't forget to check the mail, by the way.
- All right.

13:04.418 --> 13:06.520
Guess what? Okay, I wrote
a letter to Eleanor Roosevelt

13:06.620 --> 13:08.722
to get an autographed picture for you
and she wrote me back,

13:08.822 --> 13:12.770
and she wants to meet us, so pack your bags
because we're going to New York!

13:13.627 --> 13:15.038
We're going to New York!

13:16.797 --> 13:17.864
Gee whiz!

13:17.964 --> 13:21.268
...rainfall have left many homes
in the metro area knee deep in floodwater.

13:21.368 --> 13:23.737
Power was out for three hours
in eastern metro

13:23.837 --> 13:27.741
because of downed hydro-fines
and police report at feast 200 accidents.

13:27.841 --> 13:29.843
No injuries were reported.

13:30.977 --> 13:34.481
The search for escaped prisoner Frank Morris
and the Anglin brothers has been called off.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.750
The three escaped from Alcatraz
five months ago,

13:36.850 --> 13:38.852
but no bodies have been recovered.

14:07.481 --> 14:10.587
I don't know why
I said those things to my mother.

14:11.051 --> 14:14.089
I regretted them
the second they fell out of my mouth.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.865
My mother never gave her speech.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.267
She never got to meet Eleanor Roosevelt.

14:20.994 --> 14:22.029
But I could.

14:38.445 --> 14:39.480
Heads,

14:40.914 --> 14:41.984
I go.

14:43.450 --> 14:44.861
Tails,

14:46.119 --> 14:47.154
I don't.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.440
We're gonna get to see
the whole country, Ellie.

15:02.636 --> 15:05.038
- Gosh, I love America.
- You've never even been out of Manteca,

15:05.138 --> 15:07.982
and New York's a metropolis.
And you can't drive.

15:08.275 --> 15:11.078
Yeah, I can. My mom was a feminist.
She taught me early.

15:11.178 --> 15:13.180
Yeah, her mom's a feminist,
and I'm gonna be one, too.

15:13.280 --> 15:15.115
You don't even know what that means.

15:15.215 --> 15:18.251
It means you're gonna stay home
and take care of the Little Elvis, Billy!

15:18.351 --> 15:21.054
Do you think she's gonna make us
recite the pledge of allegiance?

15:21.154 --> 15:22.292
Maybe.

15:23.557 --> 15:25.935
She wrote to you.
Why can't you be satisfied with that?

15:26.259 --> 15:28.962
We should go visit my Aunt Daisy
in Las Vegas.

15:29.062 --> 15:32.566
And I also want to stop by the actor studio
to give that Lee Strasberg a holler.

15:32.966 --> 15:34.935
- Who's Lee Strasberg?
- Wait, who's Aunt Daisy?

15:35.035 --> 15:36.639
I got a picture of her right here.

15:37.404 --> 15:39.706
- What happened to her head?
- Little Elvis ate her face off.

15:39.806 --> 15:43.043
She's really cool. She's a showgirl
and she has her own theater on the strip.

15:43.143 --> 15:45.078
This is gonna be so boss.

15:45.178 --> 15:47.080
So we're gonna skip school on Friday,

15:47.180 --> 15:49.583
and I'll tell my dad I'm staying with you
over the weekend,

15:49.683 --> 15:52.552
and you tell your mom
you're staying with me over the weekend,

15:52.652 --> 15:55.895
and then when they find out,
we'll already be long gone.

15:56.056 --> 15:57.157
You two don't have no money.

15:57.257 --> 15:59.059
Shut your mouth, Billy.
I know where we can get some.

15:59.159 --> 16:03.237
Yeah. Stop giving us the business, Billy.
We know where we can get some money.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.648
Why are you touching Mom's piano?

16:23.583 --> 16:25.062
I can touch it if I want.

16:25.185 --> 16:28.064
Dad don't want no one
touching Mama's piano.

16:28.255 --> 16:31.191
If I told you a good secret,
would you help me out?

16:31.291 --> 16:34.194
But you have to promise
not to tell a soul, not even Dad.

16:34.294 --> 16:36.263
Dad don't want me
keeping secrets from him!

16:36.363 --> 16:37.933
I'm doing something for Mom.

16:38.198 --> 16:39.233
But to do it,

16:40.133 --> 16:41.601
I have to sell her piano.

16:41.701 --> 16:44.237
And if she were here right now,
she'd be okay with it

16:44.337 --> 16:46.908
because people are more important
than stuff, right?

16:50.577 --> 16:51.988
I'll give you 5 bucks.

17:47.067 --> 17:49.809
My mom and Marilyn Monroe
died on the same day.

17:51.071 --> 17:55.076
I imagined Marilyn picking my mom up
like some kind of girls' night out.

17:56.309 --> 17:57.444
Just the two of them.

17:57.544 --> 18:01.890
The 1948 Chrysler Windsor
with a drop top in Robin's egg blue?

18:02.148 --> 18:04.424
- The very one.
- Smile!

18:05.218 --> 18:06.319
We're going to New York!

18:06.419 --> 18:09.366
They'd hop into Marilyn's pink Thunderbird
and hit the road.

18:10.256 --> 18:12.031
Didn't seem so lonely.

18:12.692 --> 18:13.727
Seemed nice.

18:23.269 --> 18:28.446
V-A-C-A-T-I-O-N, in the summer sun!

18:28.675 --> 18:31.451
Put away the books, we're out of school

18:31.811 --> 18:34.614
The weather's warm but we play it cool

18:34.714 --> 18:38.924
We're on vacation in the summer sun!

18:39.352 --> 18:41.958
How many miles to New York?

18:42.155 --> 18:43.323
3,000

18:43.423 --> 18:44.791
- You kidding me?
- No.

18:44.891 --> 18:48.328
And here is our money.

18:48.428 --> 18:50.530
That's all we've got
so put it in a safe spot, okay?

18:50.630 --> 18:53.033
Holy moly, that's a lot of moolah.

18:53.133 --> 18:55.477
I don't think I've ever seen
this much money in my whole life.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.378
- All safe.
- Great.

19:00.173 --> 19:02.153
Okay, I was gonna wait,

19:02.509 --> 19:06.457
but since we're about to have
the time of our lives...

19:07.747 --> 19:09.516
Okay, just some pictures of Mrs. Roosevelt

19:09.616 --> 19:12.285
that I cut out of the library books
during study hall.

19:12.385 --> 19:14.254
And I thought that we could put
some of our own pictures

19:14.354 --> 19:17.198
- and some stuff in the back, too.
- Thanks, Max.

19:17.891 --> 19:19.131
Okay.

19:26.866 --> 19:28.802
Close surveillance

19:28.902 --> 19:32.714
of the Soviet military buildup
on the island of Cuba

19:32.839 --> 19:34.774
- within the past week...
- This place is a real dump.

19:34.874 --> 19:39.312
...unmistakable evidence has established
the fact that a series of offensive

19:39.412 --> 19:43.758
missile sites is now in preparation
on that imprisoned island.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.586
The purpose of these bases

19:46.686 --> 19:48.555
- seems to be none other...
- It just ate my quarter again!

19:48.655 --> 19:52.501
...than to provide a nuclear strike capability
against the Western hemisphere.

19:52.625 --> 19:57.263
And having now confirmed and completed
our evaluation of the evidence

19:57.363 --> 19:59.365
and our decision on a course of action,

19:59.499 --> 20:01.501
this government feels obliged to report...

20:01.601 --> 20:05.171
A rodent just walked through the bathroom.
He did not look like the Little Elvis.

20:05.271 --> 20:06.439
Well, who did he look like?

20:06.539 --> 20:08.348
Like a little Jerry Lee.

20:08.641 --> 20:11.952
Several of them include
medium range ballistic missiles.

20:12.212 --> 20:14.954
- I think Steve will like this one.
- Capable of carrying a nuclear warhead

20:15.215 --> 20:18.318
for a distance of more than
1,000 nautical miles.

20:18.418 --> 20:20.523
Each of these missiles, in short,

20:20.653 --> 20:23.390
is capable of striking Washington, D.C.,

20:23.490 --> 20:24.867
the Panama Canal,

20:25.291 --> 20:27.227
Cape Canaveral, Mexico City,

20:27.327 --> 20:29.963
or any other city in the southeastern part
of the United States.

20:30.063 --> 20:31.197
Why is he talking about missiles?

20:31.297 --> 20:34.210
In central America,
or in the Caribbean area.

20:34.868 --> 20:37.508
Additional sites, not yet completed,

20:37.837 --> 20:41.508
appear to be designed for
intermediate range ballistic missiles

20:41.608 --> 20:43.410
capable of traveling more than...

20:43.510 --> 20:48.323
Capable of striking most of the
major cities in the western hemisphere.

20:48.615 --> 20:51.651
- Ellie?
- My fellow citizens, let no one doubt...

20:51.751 --> 20:53.620
- Where's the western hemisphere?
- ...that this is a difficult

20:53.720 --> 20:55.221
and dangerous effort

20:55.321 --> 20:57.490
- on which we have set out.
- It's right here.

20:57.590 --> 21:01.595
No one can foresee precisely
what course it will take,

21:01.995 --> 21:05.465
and what course or casualties
will be incurred.

21:05.698 --> 21:09.510
Many months of sacrifice
and self-discipline fie ahead.

21:10.336 --> 21:12.338
Months in which both our patience...

21:12.472 --> 21:15.078
- Commies want us bad, Little E.
- ...and our willpower will be tested.

21:15.475 --> 21:18.513
God willing, that goal will be achieved.

21:19.546 --> 21:21.082
Thank you and good night.

21:26.586 --> 21:28.088
I think we should go home.

21:28.321 --> 21:29.629
I'm not going home.

21:29.923 --> 21:33.370
And besides, even if we did,
we'd still be in the western hemisphere.

21:34.961 --> 21:37.597
I knew those Soviets were up to something.

21:37.697 --> 21:40.143
You know, they've been quiet
for a really long time.

21:47.574 --> 21:49.383
- Good night, Ellie.
- Good night.

21:50.310 --> 21:52.221
There it goes!

21:53.680 --> 21:55.887
What are you doing out of your house?

21:58.651 --> 22:00.858
I should set you free
behind the Bank of America.

22:01.688 --> 22:02.894
But I won't.

22:03.389 --> 22:06.768
Max would kill me,
and it would ruin my chances with her.

22:06.893 --> 22:08.328
What was I thinking, Little E?

22:08.428 --> 22:11.331
What's Mrs. Roosevelt gonna think
when those two crazy girls show up?

22:11.431 --> 22:14.640
They're gonna call the cops and
they're gonna get arrested for trespassing.

22:15.702 --> 22:17.375
Then I'll go to Folsom

22:17.870 --> 22:20.441
for forging and impersonating
a former First Lady.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.950
We have to stop them from ruining my life.

22:24.944 --> 22:26.355
Yours, too.

22:42.629 --> 22:44.631
Jack! Henry!

22:49.002 --> 22:50.538
Where's your mother's piano?

22:50.903 --> 22:52.007
It's right there, Dad.

22:52.939 --> 22:53.907
Right where?

22:54.007 --> 22:56.920
- Right where it's always at.
- I see it.

22:57.076 --> 22:58.111
Yeah?

23:00.580 --> 23:01.615
Robert!

23:02.048 --> 23:03.356
What, Dad?

23:04.083 --> 23:05.391
Where's the piano?

23:05.685 --> 23:07.221
It's right in front of you, Dad.

23:10.023 --> 23:11.093
Ellie?

23:11.391 --> 23:12.392
She's at Max's.

23:12.492 --> 23:14.894
They're working on
an outer space project for school.

23:14.994 --> 23:17.099
Yeah, she won't be back until next week.

23:17.297 --> 23:19.004
- Where's the baby?
- Kitchen.

23:21.601 --> 23:22.602
Boys...

23:22.702 --> 23:24.804
Why don't you play something for us
on the piano, Dad?

23:24.904 --> 23:26.940
What the hell is the bird
doing in the house?

23:27.040 --> 23:28.741
Bird? What bird?

23:28.841 --> 23:31.511
- Don't you give a hoot no more, Dad?
- Yes, son.

23:31.611 --> 23:33.181
I give a hoot!

23:46.592 --> 23:49.095
Zion National Park.

23:55.034 --> 23:57.537
- Where'd you put the map?
- It's in the back seat.

24:00.440 --> 24:02.920
- Should be right on top, right?
- Yeah.

24:04.610 --> 24:05.612
Well, it's...

24:05.712 --> 24:07.658
- It's not back here.
- Yes, it is.

24:07.980 --> 24:09.254
No, it's not.

24:09.682 --> 24:10.990
- It's not?
- No.

24:16.556 --> 24:18.229
I think I left it at home.

24:18.691 --> 24:20.762
- You think anyone's gonna find it?
- I don't...

24:21.461 --> 24:23.998
No. No one goes in my room. It's fine.

24:24.197 --> 24:27.800
Yeah, Mrs. Wax, I'm just trying
to find my daughter. Boys!

24:27.900 --> 24:30.570
So, yeah, so unless their project
has something to do...

24:30.670 --> 24:32.805
- Dad!
- ...with making themselves invisible,

24:32.905 --> 24:34.040
they're not here. Now I...

24:34.140 --> 24:36.009
- Dad!
- What is it, Jack?

24:36.109 --> 24:37.744
- When Ellie gets back from New York...
- Right, yes.

24:37.844 --> 24:40.381
...can we go to Kentucky Fried Chicken?

25:03.870 --> 25:06.739
It starts here, Manteca, where we are,

25:06.839 --> 25:08.574
goes across the entire country,

25:08.674 --> 25:12.622
all the way across
to Eleanor Roosevelt, okay?

25:12.745 --> 25:13.780
Ellie's gone.

25:16.215 --> 25:19.952
Okay, Johnny, I need you to go put out
an APB for me, son. Okay? Real fast.

25:20.052 --> 25:22.032
Fast as you can. Call headquarters.

25:24.791 --> 25:27.135
Hey, you kids listen to your grandma!

25:31.230 --> 25:35.635
That, Mr. President, is the Soviet
Foreign Minister's public statement

25:35.735 --> 25:39.273
about the policy of the Soviet Union
and of Cuba in this western...

25:39.505 --> 25:41.040
I told you I knew how to drive, Ellie.

25:41.140 --> 25:44.944
Max, see, for people to sleep,
you have to be quiet.

25:45.044 --> 25:48.181
...the general assembly
on Cuba's foreign policy.

25:48.281 --> 25:51.551
Faithful to these principles
of his international policy

25:51.651 --> 25:55.121
and to the principles enshrined
in the charter of the United Nations.

25:55.221 --> 25:56.859
Cuba constitutes a danger...

26:00.560 --> 26:03.598
They're selling radiation-proof huts
over at McRooters.

26:03.996 --> 26:05.898
Get this, Phil's got a scam.

26:05.998 --> 26:10.071
Selling his cotton briefs
as bomb resistant underwear.

26:10.937 --> 26:12.905
Bomb resistant underwear?

26:13.005 --> 26:15.417
- That's $9.72.
- We should get some.

26:17.243 --> 26:18.911
Have you girls seen the news?

26:19.011 --> 26:20.747
Yeah. Do you guys sell that here?

26:20.847 --> 26:22.326
You girls aren't
from around here, are you?

26:22.582 --> 26:25.084
- No, we're from California.
- California.

26:25.184 --> 26:27.120
- That must be nice.
- Yeah.

26:27.220 --> 26:28.722
You have relatives in Colorado?

26:31.991 --> 26:34.335
Why are we in Colorado, Max?
We went the wrong way.

26:34.894 --> 26:36.195
Well, which way are we headed now?

26:36.295 --> 26:38.965
North. Where did you go
while I was sleeping?

26:39.065 --> 26:40.066
Not the right way?

26:40.166 --> 26:42.135
Where is it y'all trying to get to anyhow?

26:42.235 --> 26:45.409
We're going to see Eleanor Roosevelt.
She's a close personal friend.

26:46.038 --> 26:49.008
- Do your parents know where you are?
- Yeah, of course, it was their idea.

26:49.108 --> 26:50.678
They gave us plenty of money.

26:53.779 --> 26:56.015
Listen, why don't you come home with me
to my ranch?

26:56.115 --> 26:58.918
You can stay for a couple of days
till we know what's happening.

26:59.018 --> 27:01.020
Call your parents, tell them you're safe.

27:01.220 --> 27:03.222
It's a nice little ranch. I have horses.

27:05.925 --> 27:06.995
What do you say?

27:07.994 --> 27:09.337
- Yeah. Okay.
- Yeah.

27:09.695 --> 27:10.833
Totally boss, okay.

27:11.030 --> 27:12.999
I'm gonna get... Yeah.

27:13.099 --> 27:14.867
And... And this.

27:14.967 --> 27:17.345
- Max, I already have one.
- Steve will like this one, too.

27:23.242 --> 27:24.778
You having fun, Little E?

27:40.626 --> 27:42.367
We gotta go back for him.

27:51.404 --> 27:53.042
Need a ride, sir?

27:54.106 --> 27:56.175
Billy Hobgood?
What the hell are you doing out here?

27:56.275 --> 27:57.944
I'm just out seeing the sights.

27:58.044 --> 28:01.814
Yeah? Well, I'm out here looking for
my daughter, and my truck broke down.

28:01.914 --> 28:03.018
That's what I'm doing.

28:03.316 --> 28:04.784
Well, I can give you a ride.

28:04.884 --> 28:05.852
In this?

28:05.952 --> 28:07.158
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah?

28:08.187 --> 28:10.133
This vehicle make it across country?

28:10.256 --> 28:11.724
- I think so.
- Yeah?

28:11.824 --> 28:13.226
- Yeah.
- Okay. Good.

28:13.326 --> 28:15.928
Because I know where they're going.
I got their map.

28:16.028 --> 28:17.196
My daughter, she's just...

28:17.296 --> 28:21.133
She's been acting out a little bit lately
and just having a hard time,

28:21.233 --> 28:23.002
and just been dealing with that,

28:23.102 --> 28:25.938
so I called the police and put out
an APB, so took care of all that.

28:26.038 --> 28:27.707
- Really, sir?
- Yeah.

28:27.807 --> 28:29.684
- You did that?
- I did.

28:32.411 --> 28:36.018
Son, you got nothing to do with this,
do you? And be honest with me.

28:36.282 --> 28:37.317
No, sir.

28:38.317 --> 28:39.952
- All right, well, start it up.
- Yes, sir.

28:40.052 --> 28:41.988
I'm not gonna ride
in the buddy-seat, though.

28:42.088 --> 28:44.034
You have to, sir.

28:44.690 --> 28:47.466
- And also, you have to hold the Little Elvis.
- Weird kid.

29:00.373 --> 29:04.583
And he might poop in your pocket,
so don't get too mad.

29:17.256 --> 29:19.759
Max, I don't know if this is a good idea.
We don't even know these people.

29:19.859 --> 29:22.194
She seemed really nice,
and I really want a home cooked meal

29:22.294 --> 29:24.171
and a bathroom without rodents.

29:26.999 --> 29:30.037
Hope you girls are hungry.
Dinner's almost ready.

29:30.336 --> 29:31.904
Yeah, I'm starving.

29:32.004 --> 29:34.314
This place is great.
Can we go horseback riding?

29:34.740 --> 29:37.380
Yeah, I'm sure my son can take you out.

29:37.910 --> 29:40.322
There he is. Bud! Bud!

29:50.089 --> 29:51.796
Splendor in the Grass.

29:52.058 --> 29:55.005
- He looks just like...
- Warren Beatty.

29:55.294 --> 29:57.229
Howdy. I'm Bud.

29:57.329 --> 29:58.399
I'm Max.

29:59.098 --> 30:00.099
- Ellie.
- Nice to meet you both.

30:00.199 --> 30:01.467
- They're staying with us...
- Bud. Nice to meet you.

30:01.567 --> 30:03.302
...until we get an all-clear
from the President.

30:03.402 --> 30:04.710
Well, great. Well, welcome.

30:08.941 --> 30:10.376
- Y'all coming?
- Yeah.

30:10.476 --> 30:11.511
Yeah.

30:12.078 --> 30:14.285
- Charlotte's quite the cook.
- Hold this, Max.

30:23.389 --> 30:26.726
Be sure to call your parents right after
dinner and let them know you're okay.

30:26.826 --> 30:27.861
Okay.

30:30.529 --> 30:33.408
You're squeezed in mighty tight
over there, ain't you?

30:38.304 --> 30:40.973
Do you guys want to hear
my greatest idea ever?

30:41.073 --> 30:42.313
Homing pigeons.

30:42.508 --> 30:45.352
Does this have anything to do
with what you did to the Little Elvis?

30:46.178 --> 30:50.092
No. Take a pigeon,
and I drive it to a movie star's house.

30:50.282 --> 30:51.386
Pick somebody!

30:51.984 --> 30:53.088
Warren Beatty.

30:54.420 --> 30:57.401
I don't think he likes birds, but I like
the way you're thinking. Charlotte.

30:58.157 --> 30:59.363
Marlon Brando.

31:00.092 --> 31:02.072
Yes, Brando.

31:02.328 --> 31:04.997
So, I ride my bike with the pigeon
over to Marion's house,

31:05.097 --> 31:07.466
show her Marlon's house, drive home,

31:07.566 --> 31:11.103
and then I write a note that says,
"I love you, Marlon Brando.

31:11.203 --> 31:13.877
"Will you marry me?
Check the box, 'yes' or 'no."'

31:14.173 --> 31:15.908
Then I tape it to the pigeon's leg

31:16.008 --> 31:18.844
and it flies to my fiance's house
and gives him the note.

31:18.944 --> 31:21.981
Wait, the pigeon gives Marlon the note?

31:22.081 --> 31:24.250
Boom. Flying fan-mail.

31:24.350 --> 31:25.658
That's impossible, Max.

31:25.918 --> 31:27.553
No, it's not, because I know
where we can get a pigeon.

31:27.653 --> 31:29.388
Yeah, well,
the pigeon's not the hard part.

31:29.488 --> 31:32.628
The making him fly with a note taped
to his leg to Marlon Brando's house?

31:32.892 --> 31:34.160
- Yeah, that's impossible.
- It's impossible.

31:34.260 --> 31:35.398
"Stella!"

31:37.263 --> 31:39.432
I know this guy in Detroit
who got a pigeon

31:39.532 --> 31:42.172
and he drove to his girlfriend's house
in Arkansas.

31:42.301 --> 31:44.904
And then he drove home to Detroit,
and the next day

31:45.004 --> 31:47.644
the pigeon showed up
on her doorstep in Little Rock.

31:48.107 --> 31:51.444
There's a million pigeons out there.
That could have been any bird in Little Rock.

31:51.544 --> 31:53.023
- True.
- With a note?

31:53.212 --> 31:54.780
"I could have been somebody.

31:54.880 --> 31:56.791
"I could have been a contender."

32:01.954 --> 32:04.025
Y'all want to go
squirrel hunting tomorrow?

32:11.130 --> 32:13.132
Hey, Max?

32:14.667 --> 32:17.648
I'm pretty sure I saw Frank Morris
at the store today.

32:18.103 --> 32:19.343
Who's Frank Morris?

32:20.072 --> 32:22.279
The mastermind who escaped Alcatraz.

32:22.975 --> 32:25.615
Well, Billy says
nobody makes it off Alcatraz alive.

32:26.979 --> 32:28.481
Billy doesn't know anything.

32:29.081 --> 32:30.526
Well, why was he on the Rock?

32:30.950 --> 32:33.123
I don't know. Probably murder.

32:35.688 --> 32:37.395
All I'm saying is,

32:39.458 --> 32:42.769
I'm pretty sure
I saw him steal crackers today.

32:44.396 --> 32:45.773
I need a cigarette.

32:46.365 --> 32:47.867
I'll be right back.

32:52.471 --> 32:55.077
You know, smoking's bad for you.

32:55.774 --> 32:58.277
Well, not that it matters.

32:58.744 --> 33:02.692
We're all gonna die anyway.
After all, this is the western hemisphere.

33:04.750 --> 33:05.888
Can I bum one?

33:06.552 --> 33:08.156
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

33:16.061 --> 33:17.768
You look like Warren Beatty.

33:20.666 --> 33:22.168
Do I make you nervous?

33:23.302 --> 33:24.440
No.

33:27.606 --> 33:30.246
- How old are you?
- 17.

33:34.046 --> 33:35.948
You know you're not inhaling that, right?

33:36.048 --> 33:38.324
- What?
- Here, go like this.

33:45.057 --> 33:46.092
Try it.

33:48.294 --> 33:49.466
There you go.

33:50.029 --> 33:51.372
You got it, you got it right.

33:54.633 --> 33:56.203
So, Why'd you run away from home?

33:56.602 --> 33:59.173
- I... I didn't.
- Sure you didn't.

33:59.805 --> 34:02.547
You know you can tell me.
I ain't gonna turn you in.

34:03.108 --> 34:05.247
I didn't run away from home. I'm...

34:05.544 --> 34:06.716
I'm on vacation.

34:08.147 --> 34:10.127
Hey, you wanna see something cool?

34:11.684 --> 34:14.062
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Come on. Let's go.

34:16.255 --> 34:17.290
Come on.

34:20.326 --> 34:21.600
It's beautiful, huh?

34:22.226 --> 34:23.262
Yeah.

35:40.839 --> 35:42.375
They're not 17.

35:42.641 --> 35:45.349
Look at this postcard
Max asked me to mail.

35:46.145 --> 35:49.114
"Dear Steve,
it's your favorite 15-year-old again.

35:49.214 --> 35:51.116
"I was in the great state
of Utah recently.

35:51.216 --> 35:54.356
"This is what my motel looked like.
Sincerely, Max the Wax."

35:56.221 --> 35:59.591
I mentioned calling their parents,
they changed the subject,

35:59.691 --> 36:02.061
so I'm gonna call the police
in the morning.

36:02.161 --> 36:03.504
I think they're runaways.

36:04.196 --> 36:05.732
Why don't you call Max's father?

36:06.331 --> 36:07.833
I don't have his phone number.

36:08.700 --> 36:10.536
You don't have
Steve McQueen's phone number.

36:10.636 --> 36:12.172
I don't think so.

36:12.538 --> 36:13.778
You better not.

36:19.711 --> 36:21.816
Wake up. We're leaving.

36:23.248 --> 36:26.218
Why? Did your boyfriend
break up with you already?

36:26.318 --> 36:27.753
What? No.

36:27.853 --> 36:32.458
"Dear Steve McQueen, it's your favorite
15-year-old again." That's what it is.

36:32.558 --> 36:35.505
Charlotte thinks we're runaways.
She's calling the police.

36:36.361 --> 36:39.604
Charlotte's making chocolate
chip pancakes for breakfast.

36:39.798 --> 36:43.402
Gosh, we don't have time
for chocolate chip pancakes!

36:43.502 --> 36:44.503
Ellie!

36:44.603 --> 36:45.638
Get up.

36:51.643 --> 36:53.579
You kissed him, didn't you?

36:53.679 --> 36:54.747
Are you kidding me right now?

36:54.847 --> 36:56.382
Why'd you have to tell everyone
Steve McQueen's

36:56.482 --> 36:58.150
- your dad in the first place, Max?
- You know,

36:58.250 --> 37:00.719
sometimes you have to believe
stuff like that, Ellie.

37:00.819 --> 37:01.787
You don't know.

37:01.887 --> 37:05.057
You know, maybe Steve likes my cards,
and maybe one day,

37:05.157 --> 37:08.260
he'll pick me up in his corvette and give
Dave the what's what for a whole day.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.237
And it'll be great...

37:10.729 --> 37:12.197
- What was that?
- I don't know.

37:12.297 --> 37:14.777
- Max, what was that?
- I don't know. You hit it.

37:15.334 --> 37:16.502
Oh, my God, it was a squirrel!

37:16.602 --> 37:20.305
- No, no, no, no! I killed a squirrel.
- You hit a squirrel!

37:20.405 --> 37:23.475
- Why would you do that, Ellie?
- Because I was distracted.

37:23.575 --> 37:28.354
- Well, why were you distracted?
- Because you won't stop talking.

37:28.514 --> 37:30.215
- Oh, my God.
- One of the reasons that you like me

37:30.315 --> 37:31.658
is because I talk!

37:32.384 --> 37:33.419
You know what?

37:33.886 --> 37:34.920
Are you serious right now?

37:35.020 --> 37:37.256
I hate to say it,
but it's a great addition to the scrapbook.

37:37.356 --> 37:38.424
I'm done.

37:38.524 --> 37:40.526
- I'm done. Stop! Hush!
- You're...

37:40.726 --> 37:42.069
Don't talk.

37:42.427 --> 37:44.338
Let's drive in peace, please.

37:49.968 --> 37:51.413
This trip is a disaster.

37:51.837 --> 37:53.339
A complete disaster.

37:56.642 --> 37:58.811
- Can we just go see Aunt Daisy now?
- Fine. Fine.

37:58.911 --> 37:59.981
Who's Aunt Daisy?

38:03.315 --> 38:05.584
- Stop. Stop. Stop screaming!
- We're just kids!

38:05.684 --> 38:07.459
Are you the mastermind from Alcatraz?

38:07.886 --> 38:09.955
- Is that what they're calling me now?
- I knew it was you!

38:10.055 --> 38:11.523
I knew it was you, Frank Morris.

38:11.623 --> 38:14.331
- It's Frank Morris?
- Yes! This is Frank Morris!

38:14.593 --> 38:17.262
- We're going to die. We're gonna die!
- I'm not dying in Colorado!

38:17.362 --> 38:20.639
Hold on, no one's going to die.
Now calm the hell down.

38:21.767 --> 38:23.635
You know what?
Before you do this, you should know

38:23.735 --> 38:25.571
that I am just like you, okay?

38:25.671 --> 38:29.483
I put laxative in my teacher's coffee
and she was out of school for two days.

38:29.875 --> 38:31.343
I have a longer rap sheet than you, Frank.

38:31.443 --> 38:34.390
I am bad. I am bad, all right?
I am... Ellie, I am bad.

38:34.513 --> 38:36.048
Max, hey, give him the money.

38:36.148 --> 38:37.116
We don't have any money.

38:37.216 --> 38:38.650
- Give him the money, Max!
- We do not have any money!

38:38.750 --> 38:40.319
I don't want your money.

38:40.419 --> 38:41.987
I don't need to go back to prison.
I want something else.

38:42.087 --> 38:43.455
You are not gonna get any of the money!

38:43.555 --> 38:44.761
Relax.

38:45.457 --> 38:47.596
I just need a ride.

39:00.405 --> 39:01.440
Okay.

39:01.840 --> 39:06.445
Now, we're gonna walk in calmly,
sit down nicely

39:06.545 --> 39:08.582
and you're gonna act like I'm your pa.

39:22.561 --> 39:25.364
This is Sunset Boulevard,
Los Angeles, California.

39:25.464 --> 39:26.798
It's about 5:00 in the morning.

39:26.898 --> 39:29.868
That's the homicide squad complete
with detectives and newspapermen.

39:29.968 --> 39:32.204
A murder has just been reported
from one of those great big houses...

39:32.304 --> 39:33.739
- What are you talking about?
- ...on the 10,000 block.

39:33.839 --> 39:36.008
- Monologue. You can't stop her.
- You'll see it in the late editions.

39:36.108 --> 39:37.442
- Monologue?
- I'm sure. It'll play over your radio.

39:37.542 --> 39:38.710
And you'll see it on television.

39:38.810 --> 39:40.913
Because an old time star is involved.

39:41.013 --> 39:42.253
One of the biggest.

39:42.514 --> 39:46.485
But before it gets all distorted,
blown out of proportion,

39:46.585 --> 39:49.794
before those Hollywood columnists
get their hands on it,

39:50.022 --> 39:52.093
maybe you want to hear the facts.

39:53.025 --> 39:54.927
If so, you've come to the right party.

39:55.027 --> 39:57.496
- Make her stop.
- I can't. She's gotta finish.

39:57.596 --> 40:00.736
You see, a young man was found dead
in her mansion swimming pool.

40:00.999 --> 40:03.702
Two shots in his back
and one in his stomach.

40:03.802 --> 40:05.003
No one important, really.

40:05.103 --> 40:08.414
Just a movie writer with a couple
of B pictures to his credit.

40:08.573 --> 40:10.678
The poor dope. He always wanted a pool.

40:11.510 --> 40:14.218
Well, in the end, he got himself a pool.

40:15.847 --> 40:18.555
Only the price turned out
to be a little high.

40:22.621 --> 40:24.523
- Hey, Delores.
- Hey, how are you? Good to see you.

40:24.623 --> 40:26.068
Hey, Officers.

40:29.661 --> 40:31.072
How's your night going?

40:32.064 --> 40:34.772
Let's sit up near the bar here.

40:35.434 --> 40:36.504
Cool.

40:40.005 --> 40:41.707
You rat me out,

40:41.807 --> 40:44.376
and I'll tell them
that you're juvenile delinquent runaways,

40:44.476 --> 40:47.480
and you'll be the ones
trying to find your way off Alcatraz.

40:57.856 --> 40:59.130
Man, this is tepid.

41:02.994 --> 41:04.200
Hey. Hi.

41:04.463 --> 41:05.864
Can you heat this up for me?

41:05.964 --> 41:10.379
And can you also put some more of that
"pff, pff," on top? Thanks.

41:11.002 --> 41:12.106
Coming right up.

41:13.038 --> 41:15.374
I hear you have to eat slop
in prison, Frank. Is that true?

41:15.474 --> 41:17.743
You say another word
and that's all you'll ever eat.

41:17.843 --> 41:20.653
No more "pff, pff," ever, you hear me?

41:20.879 --> 41:23.257
I'm in charge now.

41:24.216 --> 41:25.251
Okay.

41:27.719 --> 41:31.260
You know, none of this would have happened
if you didn't take us on that stupid detour.

41:31.523 --> 41:33.091
- Don't blame me.
- Like, didn't you?

41:33.191 --> 41:34.393
Yeah, well, whoop-de-doo.

41:34.493 --> 41:35.836
That should have been a clue.

41:36.962 --> 41:39.364
You meet a guy who looks like
Warren Beatty and ride a horse.

41:39.464 --> 41:41.099
None of that would have happened
if it wasn't for me.

41:41.199 --> 41:43.335
Yeah, if it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't be stuck with this guy!

41:43.435 --> 41:45.404
- Hey, hey, hey. Sit down.
- I'm not gonna sit down.

41:45.504 --> 41:48.273
If you didn't write that stupid letter
to Eleanor Roosevelt in the first place,

41:48.373 --> 41:49.808
we wouldn't be
in this predicament right now.

41:49.908 --> 41:52.010
I only wrote that letter, Ellie,
because I'm your best friend

41:52.110 --> 41:53.783
and I didn't want you to end it.

41:53.979 --> 41:57.149
Maybe you just should have, because
you're not the only one with problems.

41:57.249 --> 41:58.417
- Thank you.
- Come back soon, now.

41:58.517 --> 41:59.751
Will you shut up, Max?

41:59.851 --> 42:00.852
You don't even know
what you're talking about.

42:00.952 --> 42:03.021
You kissed Bud
when you knew that I liked him.

42:03.121 --> 42:05.924
- This is about scoring Warren?
- Yeah, it's about scoring Warren!

42:06.024 --> 42:08.927
Sol kissed him. Big deal.
We're never gonna see him again.

42:09.027 --> 42:10.629
- Sit down.
- I'm not gonna sit down.

42:10.729 --> 42:12.798
- You know one more thing?
- I blame you

42:12.898 --> 42:14.566
for not letting me eat
those chocolate chip pancakes.

42:14.666 --> 42:16.501
Chocolate chip pancakes! Come on.

42:16.601 --> 42:18.437
My mom doesn't even care about anything

42:18.537 --> 42:20.572
other than stupid Cream of Wheat
and I gosh-darn hate it!

42:20.672 --> 42:22.743
- She's driving me nuts.
- No, you don't!

42:24.142 --> 42:27.680
- You're welcome. You're crazy!
- You're crazy!

42:32.684 --> 42:33.719
Frank.

42:33.852 --> 42:36.332
This is for your own good, okay?

42:44.596 --> 42:46.974
I thought you knew me
better than this, Max.

42:48.934 --> 42:49.969
I do.

42:52.671 --> 42:54.981
Besides, I think
I like somebody else anyway.

43:02.013 --> 43:03.151
Hey, buddy?

43:05.717 --> 43:08.019
I got two kids just like that at home.

43:08.119 --> 43:10.725
Hey, take a napkin. Clean yourself up.

43:13.925 --> 43:16.599
Cops won't give a reward
to a couple of kids.

43:16.795 --> 43:18.897
They'll just say we're runaways
and send us home.

43:18.997 --> 43:21.477
Definitely, definitely no cops.

43:25.103 --> 43:26.605
My gosh, here he comes.

43:26.705 --> 43:28.048
- What?
- Lock the door.

43:35.146 --> 43:36.887
Come on, open up.

43:37.048 --> 43:38.152
Open the door.

43:41.653 --> 43:43.188
- Open the door.
- What's on your face?

43:43.288 --> 43:45.624
- Open the door.
- No, Alcatraz man.

43:45.724 --> 43:47.260
I already bailed you out once.

43:50.228 --> 43:51.997
- What's he doing?
- I don't know!

43:52.097 --> 43:54.966
"Want to hear a story
about right-hand, left-hand?

43:55.066 --> 43:57.002
"A story about good and evil?"

43:57.102 --> 43:59.070
- Okay, I know this one. My gosh!
- "H-A-T-E."

43:59.170 --> 44:01.173
- It's going to kill me. I know this one.
- "It was with this hand

44:01.273 --> 44:04.609
"that old brother Cain struck the blow
that laid his brother low.

44:04.709 --> 44:06.711
"L-O-V-E.

44:07.045 --> 44:08.647
"You see these fingers, dear hearts?

44:08.747 --> 44:11.650
"The veins go straight
to the soul of a man.

44:11.750 --> 44:14.128
"The right hand, the hand of love.

44:15.287 --> 44:17.995
"Let me tell you a story,
a story about life.

44:18.757 --> 44:20.896
"These fingers, they were...

44:21.159 --> 44:23.261
"They were a-warring and a-fighting,

44:23.361 --> 44:26.965
"one against the other,
and old brother left hand,

44:27.065 --> 44:30.235
"he was a-fighting
and it looked like love was a goner,

44:30.335 --> 44:31.973
"but wait a minute.

44:32.203 --> 44:34.205
"Wait a minute.

44:34.539 --> 44:37.075
"Love. Love was a-winning.

44:37.175 --> 44:39.678
"Hot dog, love was the winner.

44:39.878 --> 44:41.880
"Old left hand, hate,

44:42.747 --> 44:43.815
"he was down for the count."

44:43.915 --> 44:45.917
Night of the Hunter, Robert Mitchum!

44:46.918 --> 44:48.022
Loved that.

44:48.153 --> 44:49.461
Don't leave me out here.

44:50.922 --> 44:51.957
I think we should take him, Ellie.

44:52.057 --> 44:54.799
Heck, this guy's better than Brando.
I can learn a lot from this fellow.

45:04.135 --> 45:06.240
- Night of the Hunter, huh?
- You got it.

45:07.005 --> 45:08.040
I got it.

45:11.810 --> 45:14.290
Did you work a lot on your fitness
in prison, Frank?

45:14.813 --> 45:16.815
Not a lot else to do on the Rock.

45:18.216 --> 45:19.490
It shows.

45:23.955 --> 45:26.691
Is it wrong to think
a convict is cute, Ellie?

45:26.791 --> 45:30.329
He's an old man. He's probably already 30.

45:51.750 --> 45:53.318
Everything's A-okay, Mr. Potter.

45:53.418 --> 45:55.125
My parents are glad I'm gone.

45:55.987 --> 45:58.900
- Got fired from Dairy Deluxe, though.
- It happens.

46:01.259 --> 46:03.161
- Can I ask you a question, sir?
- Right now?

46:03.261 --> 46:04.797
How come you gave up pumpkins?

46:05.163 --> 46:06.364
How come I did what?

46:06.464 --> 46:09.568
You're not really a farmer anymore, sir.
All your pumpkins are rotting.

46:09.668 --> 46:12.571
I just see you sitting in your truck
doing nothing. It's creepy.

46:12.671 --> 46:16.074
I don't know why you'd call it
creepy, son. I mean,

46:16.174 --> 46:18.143
I don't get the problem
you kids have with that truck.

46:18.243 --> 46:21.986
I just enjoy sitting in there
and smoking the occasional cigarette.

46:22.347 --> 46:24.793
I like it. Makes me feel good.

46:25.150 --> 46:27.852
See, I think you might get confused
sometimes because, you know,

46:27.952 --> 46:29.522
you're just a little kid.

46:29.788 --> 46:31.923
You know, what are you? About 12?

46:32.023 --> 46:33.091
- Sixteen, sir.
- Okay.

46:33.191 --> 46:34.960
Well, see, I'm a grown man,

46:35.060 --> 46:41.433
and sometimes grown men do things
that younger people don't understand.

46:41.533 --> 46:43.435
It doesn't make sense to you
'cause you haven't...

46:43.535 --> 46:46.605
You haven't been around,
and I don't just mean

46:46.705 --> 46:48.241
been around town, I mean you haven't...

46:49.074 --> 46:51.743
You haven't been alive that long,
so you don't really know

46:51.843 --> 46:55.380
what in the hell's going on a lot of the time,
so you get kind of confused like...

46:55.480 --> 46:56.515
Like you do.

46:57.115 --> 46:58.287
But...

46:59.517 --> 47:04.159
I appreciate your being interested
in how I spend my private time.

47:06.257 --> 47:07.525
Why don't you finish up?

47:07.625 --> 47:09.104
- We gotta get back out on the road.
- Yes, sir.

47:10.528 --> 47:12.397
You gotta... You gotta keep eating

47:12.497 --> 47:15.171
- and just don't talk for a minute, okay?
- Yes, sir.

47:15.533 --> 47:19.971
Dazzling Daisy's Palace, showtimes,
all right, 2:00, 4:00 and 6:00 p.m.

47:20.071 --> 47:21.379
What time is it, guys?

47:22.340 --> 47:24.809
- All right, comes to 5 and 30.
- It's 1:30.

47:24.909 --> 47:27.583
Well, hurry up! We can make it!

47:29.380 --> 47:31.249
Charleston Chew?
How did you know I like Charleston Chew?

47:31.349 --> 47:33.818
I want a bite.
Everyone likes candy, Frank.

47:33.918 --> 47:35.192
It's not that, it's my favorite.

47:38.990 --> 47:42.460
If I hear this song again,
I'm gonna kill someone.

47:42.560 --> 47:45.130
- That's not funny, Frank.
- Relax, it's just a euphemism.

47:45.230 --> 47:48.033
- What's a euphemism?
- A nicer way of saying something.

47:48.133 --> 47:50.579
- Like, lovin' them up?
- Yeah.

47:52.237 --> 47:54.046
Frank, guess what I just did.

47:54.439 --> 47:55.543
I don't know. What?

47:55.974 --> 47:58.511
I just ate a peanut M&M
with two nuts in it.

48:00.478 --> 48:02.414
So, tell me about this Aunt Daisy.

48:02.514 --> 48:06.551
She was a big Broadway showgirl
until she married my Uncle Rocko,

48:06.651 --> 48:09.354
and he thought it would be better
for her career to move to Las Vegas.

48:09.454 --> 48:12.492
She's the best in the business, Frank,
and an amazing dancer.

48:13.525 --> 48:16.506
Great, make it fast.
I want to get back on the road.

48:17.095 --> 48:19.507
You're not coming in, Frank.
You're staying in the car.

48:20.064 --> 48:23.944
Fine. I don't want to see some old lady
doing the splits with a hula-hoop anyway.

48:25.069 --> 48:27.071
I gotta say,
it looks better in the movies.

48:27.205 --> 48:30.008
Where's Frank Sinatra
and the Rat Pack and the dancing women?

48:30.108 --> 48:32.310
Where's Bugsy and his bulletproof office?

48:32.410 --> 48:35.948
Max, you didn't think we were going to
Las Vegas, Nevada, did you?

48:38.116 --> 48:39.217
Are there two Las Vegases?

48:39.317 --> 48:40.352
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

48:40.919 --> 48:44.423
And the one Aunt Daisy lives in,
that's Las Vegas, New Mexico.

48:55.800 --> 48:56.870
All right.

49:07.045 --> 49:09.047
This is certainly a full house.

49:11.482 --> 49:13.318
All right, ladies and gentlemen.

49:13.418 --> 49:20.233
Let's give a warm Las Vegas welcome
for the star of the show, Dazzling Daisy!

50:44.342 --> 50:46.185
Let's go find her. Come on.

50:51.716 --> 50:53.351
Max, are we supposed to be in here?

50:53.451 --> 50:55.226
She's my aunt. I can do what I want.

50:59.824 --> 51:01.201
Gone with the Wind.

51:03.661 --> 51:07.198
This is like Clark Gable's suit!
We should get this for Frank!

51:07.298 --> 51:09.209
- This is her stuff.
- I'm going to get it on the way out.

51:10.435 --> 51:12.506
Jeez, she's got a lot of stuff.

51:13.104 --> 51:16.507
Aunt Daisy, are you back here?
It's your favorite niece, Maxine!

51:16.607 --> 51:17.709
Maxie?

51:17.809 --> 51:19.577
- Is it really you?
- Yeah.

51:19.677 --> 51:21.122
Honey!

51:21.245 --> 51:23.114
What are you doing here?

51:23.214 --> 51:25.216
Well, my friend Ellie and I
are on our way to New York.

51:25.316 --> 51:26.317
We decided to stop by.

51:26.417 --> 51:28.519
- Ellie, this is my Aunt Daisy.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

51:28.619 --> 51:30.221
- I like your show.
- Thank you.

51:30.321 --> 51:33.691
I just started incorporating
the whole hula-hoop thing and, you know,

51:33.791 --> 51:35.493
you just never know
how it's gonna turn out.

51:35.593 --> 51:39.507
Sensational. Do you live here?
With all this stuff?

51:40.198 --> 51:42.166
Well, you know,
it needs a bit of straightening,

51:42.266 --> 51:45.543
but I couldn't imagine
parting with any of it.

51:46.537 --> 51:48.172
This is one of my favs.

51:48.272 --> 51:51.685
Worn by the Sandra Church in Gypsy.

51:52.810 --> 51:55.381
What about this pizza box?
Can you get rid of this pizza box?

51:55.513 --> 51:56.856
Give it to me.

51:58.416 --> 51:59.517
So, where did you put Uncle Rocko?

51:59.617 --> 52:03.121
He vamoosed a long time ago
when he couldn't fit through the door.

52:05.156 --> 52:07.258
Would you girls like some tea and cookies?

52:07.358 --> 52:08.359
Yeah.

52:08.459 --> 52:10.461
Great. Coming right up.

52:12.730 --> 52:17.236
Look. She circles dance auditions,
but then she just crosses them out.

52:20.805 --> 52:23.251
This one's for next week. In New York.

52:24.442 --> 52:25.710
We have to get her to go
to that audition, Ellie.

52:25.810 --> 52:27.445
All right, catch the cookies.

52:27.545 --> 52:29.718
My goodness.

52:30.214 --> 52:31.818
- And the tea?
- What?

52:32.450 --> 52:35.286
I'm just kidding. I'm not crazy.

52:35.386 --> 52:38.367
Well, I might be a little crazy,
but not that crazy.

52:40.358 --> 52:42.304
So, New York City.

52:43.161 --> 52:45.607
My goodness, I love New York.

52:47.298 --> 52:48.800
Yeah, it's just...

52:48.900 --> 52:51.135
It's really lonely on the road,
isn't it, Max?

52:51.235 --> 52:54.472
I have an idea.
Why don't you come with us, Aunt Daisy?

52:54.572 --> 52:56.841
- That's a great idea, Max.
- Isn't that a great idea?

52:56.941 --> 53:01.856
No. I can't go with you guys to New York.

53:02.280 --> 53:05.316
- You won't be gone for long.
- Yeah. Just think of it as a holiday.

53:05.416 --> 53:07.259
I can't leave all this.

53:08.286 --> 53:11.290
You need to do this.
You see this audition here?

53:11.889 --> 53:14.592
You're gonna make this audition,
and we're gonna help you get there.

53:14.692 --> 53:16.561
Daisy, you have to get back out there.

53:16.661 --> 53:21.007
You don't belong here, on this stage.
You need to be on the big stage.

53:23.868 --> 53:25.870
The big stage.

53:27.538 --> 53:28.881
Rise and shine.

53:33.277 --> 53:34.779
I got you a present.

53:34.879 --> 53:37.615
- Who the hell is this?
- I'm Daisy.

53:37.715 --> 53:39.384
- Daisy, this is...
- Daisy.

53:39.484 --> 53:41.686
- My acting coach.
- Max's acting coach,

53:41.786 --> 53:43.322
- Lee Strasberg.
- Yeah.

53:43.888 --> 53:45.890
You're not Lee Strasberg.

53:45.990 --> 53:48.493
I met Lee Strasberg,
and you don't look a thing like him.

53:48.659 --> 53:49.933
You look familiar, though.

53:50.261 --> 53:52.697
- Must be a different Lee Strasberg.
- Must be.

53:52.797 --> 53:54.834
All right, New York, here we come.

55:03.634 --> 55:07.338
I gave Lee a couple of egg rolls, but he
said he'd be fine just sleeping in the car.

55:07.438 --> 55:09.315
We should just say, "Dear Ed."

55:09.674 --> 55:12.610
You can't just call him Ed.
Just say, "Dear Mr. Sullivan."

55:12.710 --> 55:14.445
Ed is more personal, Ellie.

55:14.545 --> 55:15.613
What are you two bickering about?

55:15.713 --> 55:18.694
Trying to get on The Ed Sullivan Show,
so we can show him our dance.

55:18.849 --> 55:22.592
- Your dance?
- It's a tribute to the late, great

55:23.387 --> 55:24.730
Marilyn Monroe.

55:25.456 --> 55:26.833
I want to see your dance.

55:29.427 --> 55:30.461
Yeah, put on the record.

55:30.561 --> 55:33.440
Well, it'd be much better on a big stage,
but okay.

55:38.936 --> 55:40.347
- Good, Ellie?
- Yeah.

56:49.407 --> 56:50.681
How was that?

56:50.941 --> 56:53.344
- Amazing.
- Let's do it for Eleanor Roosevelt.

56:53.444 --> 56:56.414
- Showed it to our friend Billy once.
- But he didn't say anything.

56:56.514 --> 56:57.848
Okay, it's your turn. Max, get her record.

56:57.948 --> 56:59.188
Yeah!

57:01.886 --> 57:03.297
- This one?
- Yeah.

57:04.889 --> 57:06.596
Any song but that song.

57:08.693 --> 57:11.799
You know, as a matter of fact,
I'm not gonna dance tonight.

57:16.434 --> 57:20.780
Harry Truman called Eleanor Roosevelt
the First Lady of the world.

57:20.905 --> 57:23.407
She answered the door
to the White House herself.

57:23.507 --> 57:25.109
When she wanted to learn how to fly,

57:25.209 --> 57:28.012
she got Amelia Earhart
to promise to teach her.

57:28.112 --> 57:31.949
She could only cook scrambled eggs,
and served them on Sundays for dinner.

57:32.049 --> 57:36.020
And when the KKK put a bounty on her head,
she put a pistol on the car seat

57:36.120 --> 57:38.589
and drove to Tennessee
to speak on civil rights anyway.

57:38.689 --> 57:41.329
Eleanor Roosevelt stood down the Klan.

58:39.884 --> 58:41.056
Good evening,

58:42.253 --> 58:45.166
ladies, gentlemen

58:46.657 --> 58:48.102
and distinguished guests.

58:49.860 --> 58:51.601
Mrs. Roosevelt says

58:52.163 --> 58:53.733
you gain strength,

58:54.231 --> 58:56.302
- courage...
- You all right, Ellie?

58:58.436 --> 58:59.471
Yeah.

59:01.005 --> 59:02.541
What have you got there?

59:03.073 --> 59:04.416
It's just a speech.

59:04.942 --> 59:08.151
I'm just having a hard time
memorizing it all.

59:11.282 --> 59:13.626
Is that why you girls
want to go to New York?

59:14.018 --> 59:17.932
So you can deliver a speech
to Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt?

59:18.823 --> 59:20.860
- Sort of.
- That's exciting.

59:21.759 --> 59:22.897
I guess.

59:25.162 --> 59:27.665
My mom was gonna do it before she died.

59:30.201 --> 59:33.671
I didn't tell Max just because,
you know, if I can't do it,

59:33.971 --> 59:35.639
or if I chicken out...

59:35.739 --> 59:37.842
She just thinks we're going
over there to visit her

59:37.942 --> 59:40.149
and look at her gardens or something.

59:42.313 --> 59:44.520
Why do you not like the dance
Max gave you?

59:47.318 --> 59:50.554
I haven't really danced full out like that
since I was 19 years old.

59:50.654 --> 59:52.361
But you danced in Las Vegas.

59:52.623 --> 59:56.161
Yeah, I mean,
I can cha-cha-cha all day long.

59:56.660 --> 59:58.162
It's not the hardest thing in the world.

01:00:04.268 --> 01:00:06.714
Remember that outfit I showed you?

01:00:06.904 --> 01:00:08.941
- The one from Gypsy?
- Yeah.

01:00:10.074 --> 01:00:14.845
I was supposed to play the lead in Gypsy
for the Broadway premiere.

01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:16.117
What happened?

01:00:16.747 --> 01:00:18.283
Opening night came.

01:00:20.050 --> 01:00:22.690
And when it came time for the big number,

01:00:24.288 --> 01:00:27.098
I couldn't remember a step. Not one.

01:00:30.928 --> 01:00:33.602
And the audience started laughing.

01:00:34.298 --> 01:00:35.470
That's awful.

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:39.371
And then the stage hand dragged me

01:00:40.838 --> 01:00:42.840
all the way to Las Vegas.

01:00:43.774 --> 01:00:46.277
Turned out to be Las Vegas, New Mexico,

01:00:47.144 --> 01:00:48.350
of all places.

01:00:49.647 --> 01:00:51.456
- Rocko?
- Yeah.

01:00:54.652 --> 01:00:55.858
That Rocker.

01:00:59.623 --> 01:01:01.625
He wasn't all that bad, you know.

01:01:01.959 --> 01:01:04.963
He built me the theater
because he knew how much I missed it.

01:01:07.798 --> 01:01:11.109
But I never found the confidence
I had as a girl.

01:01:13.837 --> 01:01:15.009
Max is right.

01:01:15.873 --> 01:01:20.618
I gotta do this because if I don't
at least try, then I'm really finished.

01:01:25.215 --> 01:01:27.821
I really want to do this for my mom.

01:01:28.385 --> 01:01:30.387
Make her proud of me, you know?

01:01:31.221 --> 01:01:33.701
I've just never done
a speech before, or...

01:01:35.793 --> 01:01:36.931
Or anything.

01:01:37.695 --> 01:01:39.834
Let's make a deal, all right?

01:01:40.397 --> 01:01:41.933
If I do it, you do it.

01:01:42.833 --> 01:01:43.903
Pinky swear.

01:01:45.235 --> 01:01:46.305
Okay.

01:01:46.971 --> 01:01:48.450
You can do this.

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:51.110
Come here.

01:02:20.838 --> 01:02:22.181
Police! Open up!

01:02:23.741 --> 01:02:26.847
- I swear, if that's Frank...
- That Frank.

01:02:31.749 --> 01:02:33.990
Eleanor Potter and Max the Wax?

01:02:34.885 --> 01:02:36.720
- We've been caught.
- Runaways, huh?

01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:39.256
- All the way from California.
- Are you gonna book us?

01:02:39.356 --> 01:02:41.725
- On what charges?
- Juvenile delinquency.

01:02:41.825 --> 01:02:43.294
You missed school, you're underage,

01:02:43.394 --> 01:02:45.663
and you've given your parents
a first-class heart attack.

01:02:45.763 --> 01:02:47.298
Now come on, get dressed
and get your things together.

01:02:47.398 --> 01:02:48.877
We're taking you downtown right now.

01:02:49.199 --> 01:02:53.079
What? Where? All right,
we'll be there as soon as we can.

01:02:53.904 --> 01:02:55.673
Okay, they found them in Kentucky.

01:02:55.773 --> 01:02:58.742
If we get on, we can get there
in a couple of hours, put an end to all this.

01:02:58.842 --> 01:03:00.844
Let's hustle, Hobgood, come on.
There you go.

01:03:05.049 --> 01:03:06.917
- This stinks.
- Your dad's on his way.

01:03:07.017 --> 01:03:08.496
Hey, copper, how did you find us?

01:03:10.821 --> 01:03:13.958
"Dear Steve, how are you? I am fine.

01:03:14.058 --> 01:03:17.027
"I'm in Las Vegas, New Mexico,
and I ate an enchilada.

01:03:17.127 --> 01:03:20.802
"It was real good.
Talk to you soon. Love Maxine."

01:03:20.931 --> 01:03:23.067
Here's another one
all the way from Oklahoma.

01:03:23.167 --> 01:03:27.171
"Dear Steve, guess what I saw today?
Two midgets on a motorcycle.

01:03:27.271 --> 01:03:29.740
"I've never seen that before.
Wish you were here.

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:30.841
"Love, Maxine."

01:03:30.941 --> 01:03:34.111
And there's another one,
and another one, and another one.

01:03:34.211 --> 01:03:35.412
How did you get my cards?

01:03:35.512 --> 01:03:36.981
We have our ways.

01:03:37.081 --> 01:03:40.028
Max, what is wrong with you?

01:03:40.918 --> 01:03:42.753
I'm sorry.
I didn't think that we'd get caught.

01:03:42.853 --> 01:03:44.822
I should have never gone
on that stupid trip with you.

01:03:44.922 --> 01:03:47.163
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
- Yeah, no, you're always sorry.

01:03:56.433 --> 01:03:57.810
Girls!

01:03:58.702 --> 01:03:59.908
- Mom!
- Mom!

01:04:01.238 --> 01:04:03.582
I've been worried sick!

01:04:05.943 --> 01:04:07.211
Officer.

01:04:07.311 --> 01:04:10.047
Sorry, ma'am, I can only release them
to their father, Bob Potter.

01:04:10.147 --> 01:04:12.252
What? No. But...

01:04:13.083 --> 01:04:17.254
But... Dear God!

01:04:17.354 --> 01:04:21.291
He's sleeping in the car
and he gets so mad when we wake him.

01:04:21.391 --> 01:04:24.128
Sorry, ma'am, you'll have to wake him.

01:04:24.228 --> 01:04:26.397
I have to have his signature
on the release.

01:04:26.497 --> 01:04:28.238
God! Really?

01:04:29.199 --> 01:04:30.269
Yes, ma'am.

01:04:38.008 --> 01:04:39.316
Well, girls,

01:04:39.476 --> 01:04:43.080
looks like I have to go wake your father.
He's going to be very upset.

01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:45.490
He is gonna tan your little hides.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.172
Here I am.

01:05:05.302 --> 01:05:06.440
Bob Potter.

01:05:08.872 --> 01:05:10.510
- Where do I sign?
- Right here.

01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:25.466
- Hi, Daddy.
- Gee, that's a nice suit, Dad.

01:05:26.957 --> 01:05:28.800
You two are in deep trouble.

01:05:29.426 --> 01:05:30.928
Get your stuff. Let's go.

01:05:33.897 --> 01:05:34.932
Okay.

01:05:35.232 --> 01:05:37.678
Wait, wait, wait. Okay.

01:05:47.945 --> 01:05:50.755
You all lied to me.
I didn't know you were runaways.

01:05:51.114 --> 01:05:53.150
I mean, I knew you weren't Lee Strasberg,

01:05:53.250 --> 01:05:56.987
but I didn't know you were
the man from Alcatraz. Gee whiz.

01:05:57.087 --> 01:06:00.933
You two were hilarious.
You should start up a comedy team.

01:06:01.225 --> 01:06:02.670
How did y'all get that money?

01:06:03.026 --> 01:06:04.128
Ellie stole it.

01:06:04.228 --> 01:06:07.402
I didn't steal anything. I sold something.

01:06:07.531 --> 01:06:10.367
That's the thing, see?
You're just helping out a guy.

01:06:10.467 --> 01:06:13.744
A guy who went to the Rock
for stealing something.

01:06:15.272 --> 01:06:16.979
We're three of a kind.

01:06:17.507 --> 01:06:20.215
What do you mean, my wife picked her up?

01:06:20.577 --> 01:06:23.524
She did. She left here with you.

01:06:24.147 --> 01:06:25.182
No.

01:06:25.716 --> 01:06:31.496
She didn't. That's impossible you see,
because I'm here, right now, with you.

01:06:31.688 --> 01:06:34.100
- And my wife, well, she...
- Is dead.

01:06:35.959 --> 01:06:37.427
You let strangers kidnap my daughter?

01:06:37.527 --> 01:06:39.196
- Now, Mr...
- What do these people look like?

01:06:39.296 --> 01:06:40.264
Was it this lady?

01:06:40.364 --> 01:06:41.532
- Was it her?
- Was it this lady?

01:06:41.632 --> 01:06:42.633
Look at it.

01:06:44.701 --> 01:06:45.903
That's Eleanor Roosevelt.

01:06:46.003 --> 01:06:47.337
- Yes, it is. We know that.
- No shit.

01:06:47.437 --> 01:06:50.908
You two little ladies,
what are y'all running from?

01:06:51.008 --> 01:06:52.009
Nothing.

01:06:52.109 --> 01:06:53.850
No, you shouldn't run away. You're lucky.

01:06:54.678 --> 01:06:57.881
I grew up on the streets making
every bad choice a kid could make.

01:06:57.981 --> 01:07:00.484
I've been in and out of prison
from the time I was 13 years old.

01:07:00.584 --> 01:07:03.394
I was inside longer
than I was on the outside.

01:07:03.687 --> 01:07:07.257
Do you know this is
the first road trip I ever took?

01:07:07.357 --> 01:07:08.961
My first road trip.

01:07:09.993 --> 01:07:11.267
I gotta say,

01:07:12.195 --> 01:07:13.697
I'm having a heck of a time.

01:07:17.267 --> 01:07:18.746
All right, well,

01:07:19.636 --> 01:07:21.411
half hour to sunrise.

01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:44.500
Frank!

01:07:45.062 --> 01:07:48.665
Why don't you just put the mustache
back on and come with us to New York?

01:07:48.765 --> 01:07:50.176
Can't do it, Max.

01:07:51.535 --> 01:07:52.741
Can't do it.

01:07:54.237 --> 01:07:57.608
You could mastermind Alcatraz,
but you couldn't mastermind us.

01:07:57.708 --> 01:07:59.813
Nobody could mastermind you two.

01:08:01.611 --> 01:08:02.681
And Daisy?

01:08:04.715 --> 01:08:05.819
Knock 'em dead.

01:08:09.286 --> 01:08:11.555
I hope they never find you, Frank!

01:08:11.655 --> 01:08:15.068
- Yeah, me, too, Frank! Bye!
- Bye!

01:08:27.504 --> 01:08:30.542
- So long, Frank!
- Bye, Frank!

01:08:37.447 --> 01:08:40.553
All right, let's go.
Get in the car, you knuckleheads.

01:08:53.729 --> 01:08:56.133
You lock up Elvis Jr.?

01:08:56.233 --> 01:08:58.769
It's the Little Elvis,
and, yep, he's in the tub.

01:08:58.868 --> 01:09:01.238
He ain't going nowhere.
I mentioned to him that we're in Kentucky.

01:09:01.337 --> 01:09:04.374
He just couldn't believe it.
So close to Graceland, yet so far.

01:09:04.474 --> 01:09:07.176
- You talk to Little Elvis, do you, Billy?
- Yeah, I do.

01:09:07.277 --> 01:09:09.112
And he wants to know
why you stopped farming pumpkins.

01:09:09.212 --> 01:09:12.816
Give me a break, son, okay?
Been a hell of a long day.

01:09:12.916 --> 01:09:14.618
Not in the mood to talk about pumpkins.

01:09:14.718 --> 01:09:17.392
My daughter's been kidnapped
by a strange woman.

01:09:18.455 --> 01:09:20.290
Could be Eleanor Roosevelt.

01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:22.192
And Franklin.
And you should be happy about that.

01:09:22.292 --> 01:09:24.394
- Franklin's dead.
- Yeah, well they're both Democrats.

01:09:24.493 --> 01:09:26.263
That's way better
than just plain old Americans.

01:09:26.363 --> 01:09:29.733
Leave me alone. Let me think.
Thinking portion of the night, okay?

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:32.176
- Gotta formulate a plan.
- Okay.

01:09:34.371 --> 01:09:36.749
Little Elvis says
you have a gift for gourds.

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:41.152
And once a farmer, always a farmer.
You can't just stop and be something else.

01:09:42.679 --> 01:09:45.816
- He says you gave up on life.
- Tell Little Elvis to kiss my ass.

01:09:45.916 --> 01:09:47.224
I think he's right.

01:09:47.716 --> 01:09:49.390
You shouldn't smoke in bed.

01:09:49.553 --> 01:09:52.089
You know, growing up, there was
a boy on the farm next to us.

01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:54.291
Nice kid, simple, though, like you.

01:09:54.391 --> 01:09:56.460
We wouldn't let him near
any of the farm equipment.

01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:59.439
Wouldn't even let him
sit on a turned off tractor.

01:10:00.330 --> 01:10:04.401
Now, here I am, riding cross-country
with you, coast to coast.

01:10:04.501 --> 01:10:05.741
You driving.

01:10:08.605 --> 01:10:09.777
Life's funny.

01:10:10.807 --> 01:10:13.879
Well, not funny, but unpredictable.

01:10:15.178 --> 01:10:16.446
Well, I know about life.

01:10:16.546 --> 01:10:18.682
- No, I know.
- I also know about family.

01:10:18.782 --> 01:10:22.594
And how important it is to make sure
that they know how much you love them.

01:10:24.254 --> 01:10:26.323
And that they're connected to something.

01:10:26.423 --> 01:10:30.235
And it ain't enough for you to just go
and find Ellie and bring her home.

01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:33.407
Gotta make sure that she has
a real home to come back to.

01:10:40.670 --> 01:10:43.573
My gosh, Ellie, you better hurry up
because we're going to be late.

01:10:43.673 --> 01:10:46.676
We're going to miss the audition.
We're already a little late.

01:10:46.776 --> 01:10:48.645
- This is it?
- It's pretty.

01:10:48.745 --> 01:10:52.249
- I like it. So ready for this audition.
- Okay.

01:10:52.349 --> 01:10:54.124
Let's go, let's go.

01:10:55.852 --> 01:10:56.887
Okay.

01:10:57.587 --> 01:11:00.290
- All right, where's the dressing room?
- We don't have time for a dressing room.

01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:01.691
Come on, let's just get you
dressed, Daisy.

01:11:01.791 --> 01:11:03.293
- Here?
- Yeah!

01:11:03.393 --> 01:11:05.462
- Just put this on!
- All right. Unzip me.

01:11:05.562 --> 01:11:08.732
- Sorry.
- It's too tight. I gotta breathe!

01:11:08.832 --> 01:11:10.467
Do you wanna get the part or not?

01:11:10.567 --> 01:11:12.302
All right. No breathing.

01:11:12.402 --> 01:11:13.570
- What do you think?
- It's great.

01:11:13.670 --> 01:11:15.013
Here. Here.

01:11:15.739 --> 01:11:17.741
- Fluff, fluff, fluff.
- All right.

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:21.714
Hey, look at me.

01:11:22.445 --> 01:11:24.083
A deal's a deal, all right?

01:11:24.614 --> 01:11:25.752
Pinky swear.

01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:27.985
Pinky swear.

01:11:28.251 --> 01:11:29.252
You got this.

01:11:31.354 --> 01:11:33.391
- I have your record.
- Here's your record.

01:11:35.292 --> 01:11:36.393
Just one more breath.

01:11:36.493 --> 01:11:37.494
No, no, no. Okay.

01:11:37.594 --> 01:11:38.795
- You can breathe on the way.
- Breathe on the way.

01:11:38.895 --> 01:11:39.896
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Yeah.

01:11:40.330 --> 01:11:42.833
- I'm actually pretty nervous.
- You're going to do great. Great.

01:11:42.933 --> 01:11:44.901
Nerves are fine. Nerves are good.

01:11:45.001 --> 01:11:47.777
Hi, hello there. Sorry.

01:11:48.438 --> 01:11:49.576
You the 10:00?

01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:52.350
- Daisy.
- Nice to meet you, Daisy.

01:11:53.643 --> 01:11:54.778
Let's get started.

01:11:54.878 --> 01:11:57.950
- You're late.
- Yes, sir. I'm aware of that, sir.

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:05.722
She's not a mind reader.

01:12:05.822 --> 01:12:08.428
- Excuse me?
- Just hand her the record.

01:12:10.694 --> 01:12:12.332
Could you give her the record, sweetie?

01:12:13.363 --> 01:12:16.776
- The record?
- Yes, yes, yes, sorry.

01:12:18.034 --> 01:12:20.344
- Sorry.
- Whenever you're ready.

01:12:20.737 --> 01:12:22.045
You got this, Aunt Daisy.

01:12:41.491 --> 01:12:42.936
She's incredible.

01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:05.001
That was very nice.

01:15:05.101 --> 01:15:06.739
- Thank you so much.
- Very nice.

01:15:07.036 --> 01:15:09.243
It was the best audition.
They loved you. I could tell.

01:15:09.506 --> 01:15:11.374
Those directors went nuts.

01:15:11.474 --> 01:15:14.045
They were smiling,
they were studying you the entire time.

01:15:14.644 --> 01:15:15.714
Mrs. Wax?

01:15:17.213 --> 01:15:19.182
We're going to need
some more information from you.

01:15:19.282 --> 01:15:21.091
- Go.
- Great.

01:15:21.251 --> 01:15:22.419
- Aunt Daisy?
- Yes.

01:15:22.519 --> 01:15:25.755
From now on,
no more Las Vegas, New Mexico.

01:15:25.855 --> 01:15:27.524
I love you so much.

01:15:27.624 --> 01:15:29.759
Never give up on your dreams, sweetheart.

01:15:29.859 --> 01:15:31.600
You're bound for something big.

01:15:33.997 --> 01:15:35.237
And you.

01:15:36.499 --> 01:15:40.503
You give Eleanor Roosevelt
the introduction of a lifetime.

01:15:40.603 --> 01:15:41.604
Okay.

01:15:41.704 --> 01:15:43.650
Make your mother proud.

01:15:44.507 --> 01:15:45.542
Okay.

01:15:51.147 --> 01:15:52.549
I'm going to miss her.

01:15:52.649 --> 01:15:54.484
So long, Aunt Daisy!

01:15:54.584 --> 01:15:55.619
All right, let's go.

01:16:06.930 --> 01:16:08.204
Looking for these?

01:16:08.698 --> 01:16:09.733
You found them?

01:16:09.833 --> 01:16:12.245
Yeah, you left them in the motel
when the copper snagged us.

01:16:15.405 --> 01:16:16.884
I know it's your mom's speech, Ellie.

01:16:17.574 --> 01:16:18.882
I know what you're doing.

01:16:19.776 --> 01:16:21.010
You think it's stupid, what I'm doing?

01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:23.886
No, I don't think what you're doing
is stupid at all.

01:16:24.981 --> 01:16:27.325
I actually think
that it's pretty spectacular.

01:16:29.319 --> 01:16:30.696
I know, I was...

01:16:31.588 --> 01:16:34.190
I should have told you.
I should have told you what I was doing,

01:16:34.290 --> 01:16:38.395
and I didn't, and out of everyone, you
would have probably understood the most.

01:16:38.495 --> 01:16:39.769
Probably would have.

01:16:42.832 --> 01:16:46.736
Sorry I've been blaming everything on you,
and I've been such an awful friend.

01:16:46.836 --> 01:16:49.506
You know, I know that this was
supposed to be this really fun road trip,

01:16:49.606 --> 01:16:51.779
and I know I haven't been
a lot of fun lately.

01:16:54.644 --> 01:16:56.513
Ralph Waldo Emerson says that

01:16:56.613 --> 01:16:59.526
a friend is someone with whom
you can be the most sincere.

01:17:01.251 --> 01:17:05.597
But I prefer that you only meet your
once-in-a-lifetime friend once in a lifetime.

01:17:05.955 --> 01:17:07.332
And that's from The Little Rascals.

01:17:11.294 --> 01:17:13.706
You know, you're my
once-in-a-lifetime friend, Max.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.536
You know, I don't really think
you need these, Ellie.

01:17:19.636 --> 01:17:22.549
I heard you rehearsing the other night.
I think you've got it memorized.

01:17:25.241 --> 01:17:26.515
You think I can do it?

01:17:45.895 --> 01:17:47.067
What's happening?

01:17:47.697 --> 01:17:48.767
I don't know.

01:17:56.205 --> 01:17:57.343
Excuse me?

01:17:58.708 --> 01:17:59.743
What's happening?

01:18:00.076 --> 01:18:01.180
Didn't you hear?

01:18:02.946 --> 01:18:05.153
Eleanor Roosevelt died last night
in her sleep.

01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:14.532
Wait. Wait, Ellie.

01:18:16.359 --> 01:18:18.066
Let's take one more picture.

01:18:31.774 --> 01:18:33.117
Wait, Max, the guards.

01:18:35.144 --> 01:18:36.316
I'll distract them.

01:18:37.747 --> 01:18:40.057
She really had a way with people.

01:18:47.156 --> 01:18:48.430
I still can't believe it.

01:18:49.826 --> 01:18:50.861
Sir?

01:18:51.327 --> 01:18:53.034
Is the news true?

01:18:53.997 --> 01:18:55.271
Is it true?

01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:03.239
Get back. Get back, please.

01:19:03.339 --> 01:19:06.376
- Please stay back. Are you okay, miss?
- No, I am not okay.

01:19:06.476 --> 01:19:07.955
Sam! Sam, come here.

01:19:08.845 --> 01:19:11.080
- Can I get you anything?
- I am not okay.

01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:13.285
- Sam, will you go get me some water?
- She stood down the Klan.

01:20:19.282 --> 01:20:20.420
Good evening,

01:20:22.251 --> 01:20:23.355
ladies,

01:20:25.021 --> 01:20:26.295
gentlemen

01:20:27.056 --> 01:20:28.535
and distinguished guests.

01:20:32.261 --> 01:20:34.969
Mrs. Roosevelt says you gain strength,

01:20:36.165 --> 01:20:37.269
courage

01:20:38.201 --> 01:20:39.475
and confidence

01:20:40.002 --> 01:20:44.075
by every experience
in which you really look fear

01:20:44.974 --> 01:20:46.044
in the face.

01:20:46.542 --> 01:20:47.577
Why?

01:20:48.111 --> 01:20:49.351
Why?

01:20:49.479 --> 01:20:51.117
What the...

01:20:59.122 --> 01:21:00.157
Busted.

01:21:02.358 --> 01:21:03.760
Come with me, young lady.

01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:05.128
- Give me a second.
- I'm sorry,

01:21:05.228 --> 01:21:06.329
but we're going to have
to break this up now.

01:21:06.429 --> 01:21:07.830
Thank you very much
for paying your respects,

01:21:07.930 --> 01:21:09.065
- but it's time to go home.
- Thank you.

01:21:09.165 --> 01:21:11.167
Thank you. Come with me.

01:21:12.835 --> 01:21:14.542
I stand before you tonight,

01:21:15.404 --> 01:21:16.815
doing the thing

01:21:17.907 --> 01:21:19.511
I thought I could not do.

01:21:21.944 --> 01:21:25.050
Speaking before an audience of over 200,

01:21:26.549 --> 01:21:32.693
introducing the woman who has meant
so much to me and so many others,

01:21:34.290 --> 01:21:38.898
and having raised a daughter
who I am so proud of.

01:21:40.363 --> 01:21:41.535
And now,

01:21:43.332 --> 01:21:44.970
it is my great honor

01:21:46.903 --> 01:21:48.314
to introduce to you

01:21:49.505 --> 01:21:52.975
the greatest First Lady
this country has ever known,

01:21:54.544 --> 01:21:56.922
the greatest champion of human rights

01:21:59.015 --> 01:22:00.426
and a wonderful mother,

01:22:04.387 --> 01:22:06.060
Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt.

01:22:14.230 --> 01:22:15.675
I did it, Mama.

01:22:19.235 --> 01:22:21.237
And I left nothing out.

01:22:27.777 --> 01:22:29.381
How long have you been standing there?

01:22:29.679 --> 01:22:33.149
Long enough, young lady.
Now I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

01:22:35.651 --> 01:22:38.421
Your dad is here.
We drove across the country together.

01:22:38.521 --> 01:22:41.698
It was a little weird at first,
but I think we're friends now.

01:22:52.401 --> 01:22:53.436
Come here.

01:22:54.103 --> 01:22:55.309
Honey.

01:22:56.706 --> 01:22:58.708
I'm so glad you're safe.

01:23:01.277 --> 01:23:03.120
I'm here to take you home, okay?

01:23:06.315 --> 01:23:09.091
I don't know what I'm doing.
I need your help.

01:23:10.219 --> 01:23:12.455
I mean, your brothers
are like little wild animals.

01:23:12.555 --> 01:23:16.469
I wake up, the little one's just
staring at me with those goggles on.

01:23:16.659 --> 01:23:18.094
Where the hell did he get those goggles?

01:23:18.194 --> 01:23:20.538
- I don't know.
- And he doesn't speak.

01:23:22.598 --> 01:23:24.100
We can do it, though.

01:23:26.702 --> 01:23:28.579
Did you find what you were looking for?

01:23:32.074 --> 01:23:33.246
I think so.

01:23:34.710 --> 01:23:36.246
That's good.

01:23:37.613 --> 01:23:39.024
So did I.

01:23:39.682 --> 01:23:40.820
Okay.

01:23:42.218 --> 01:23:45.221
Max, I took care of the Little Elvis
for over 3,000 miles,

01:23:45.321 --> 01:23:48.962
and I wouldn't have done that for anybody
but you because I like you.

01:24:01.137 --> 01:24:03.472
Driving home with my dad, Max and Billy,

01:24:03.572 --> 01:24:06.142
I looked out the window and saw
Marilyn Monroe and my mother

01:24:06.242 --> 01:24:09.121
speeding by in Marilyn's pink Thunderbird.

01:24:09.679 --> 01:24:12.319
And I knew right then
that I was gonna be okay.

01:24:13.015 --> 01:24:14.050
And the red line highways

01:24:14.150 --> 01:24:18.496
would link us state by state until it
brought us safely back to California.

01:24:18.955 --> 01:24:21.128
Back to the pumpkin capital of the world.

01:24:22.058 --> 01:24:24.265
All in the western hemisphere.

01:24:39.408 --> 01:24:42.787
Ellie! Guess what we got
with a postmark from Ireland?

01:24:43.079 --> 01:24:44.820
"Dear girls, having the time of my life.

01:24:45.047 --> 01:24:46.482
"I wish you were here. Guess what?

01:24:46.582 --> 01:24:49.028
"I just ate a peanut M&M
with two peanuts in it.

01:24:49.318 --> 01:24:51.554
"Your friend and partner in crime,
Lee Strasberg."

01:24:51.654 --> 01:24:53.861
Give me a hand, lover boy.
Hand the baby over.
