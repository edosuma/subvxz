<i>[narrator] Previously on
1000-lb sisters...</i>

00:03.137 --> 00:05.771
<i>[Chris Combs] Today,
I'm having bariatric surgery.</i>

00:05.773 --> 00:08.173
<i>I've wanted this
for a very long time.</i>

00:08.175 --> 00:11.210
I've reduced Chris' capacity
of his stomach

00:11.212 --> 00:14.780
down to about a tenth
of what it could hold before.

00:14.782 --> 00:16.615
<i>[Chris] Now that I've had
the surgery,</i>

00:16.617 --> 00:19.318
everything I learned
has to be put to the test.

00:20.987 --> 00:25.024
I asked her the other day if she's
heard from Phillip or anything.

00:25.026 --> 00:28.127
And she's like, "No." And
then, she's just shuts down

00:28.129 --> 00:30.162
and like, "I don't want
to talk about it."

00:30.164 --> 00:33.766
<i>[Misty over phone] Well, I'm really
hoping we were done with BBW King.</i>

00:33.768 --> 00:35.401
[Amy Slaton] Oh, me too.

00:42.342 --> 00:44.977
Tammy don't need
nothing like that.

01:20.947 --> 01:23.515
[Chris speaking]

01:35.095 --> 01:36.895
Hello!

01:36.897 --> 01:41.133
Today, Tammy and I have a
follow-up appointment with Dr. Smith.

01:46.139 --> 01:48.173
[Chris] Tammy, you ready
to go to the doctor?

01:48.175 --> 01:50.109
Yeah, but...

02:09.062 --> 02:10.329
My...

02:11.064 --> 02:13.031
ex-boyfriend, Phil,

02:13.033 --> 02:15.067
has been calling

02:15.335 --> 02:17.035
and harassing me.

02:18.505 --> 02:20.105
And...

02:29.415 --> 02:31.483
[Chris speaking]

02:32.118 --> 02:34.620
[Tammy speaking]

02:37.624 --> 02:40.792
- [Chris] First of all, have you called the police?
- Yes.

02:40.794 --> 02:44.263
Well, I would say
change your number and move.

02:52.338 --> 02:56.108
What the hell are you doing on a
website, something like that, anyway?

02:56.110 --> 02:57.643
[bleep]

03:08.121 --> 03:10.856
Biggest thing is, you know,
right now, you need to worry

03:10.858 --> 03:15.994
about staying off the internet and
focusing on your diet to get your surgery.

03:15.996 --> 03:19.097
You know, Dr. Smith asked you
to keep a log.

03:19.099 --> 03:22.067
Have you even write
one day's worth in it, yet?

03:22.835 --> 03:24.469
[Chris and Tammy] No.

03:24.471 --> 03:27.172
[Chris] It stayed there
the whole 30 days, didn't it?

03:58.204 --> 04:00.038
God, I hate your couch!

04:00.373 --> 04:01.506
[Tammy] Me too.

04:07.847 --> 04:09.381
[Tammy grunts]

04:31.571 --> 04:33.105
[Tammy] I don't know.

04:35.908 --> 04:40.846
I'm hoping that Tammy's ex-boyfriend
has not caused too much damage.

04:40.848 --> 04:43.115
<i>But I'm worried about
what's gonna happen.</i>

04:43.117 --> 04:46.418
<i>If Dr. Smith
drops Tammy as a patient...</i>

04:46.420 --> 04:48.186
then, I don't know
what we're gonna do.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.289
There's no next step.

04:51.090 --> 04:52.157
[Tammy groans]

04:56.863 --> 04:59.031
[country music playing]

05:04.003 --> 05:07.005
- Hey, bitch.
- Hey! Back here in the kitchen.

05:07.007 --> 05:08.106
All right.

05:09.642 --> 05:12.010
- I got some [bleep] to try.
- Oh, Lord.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.912
I don't know about it. We're
gonna play with it, though.

05:13.914 --> 05:15.380
We're gonna see what we can do.

05:15.382 --> 05:18.383
<i>Amanda is our older sister,
mine and Tammy's.</i>

05:18.385 --> 05:21.153
We don't really see much of
Amanda because she does work.

05:21.155 --> 05:23.155
She has four boys.

05:23.157 --> 05:25.824
<i>So while Tammy and Chris
are at their doctor's appointment</i>

05:25.826 --> 05:28.160
<i>I got some stuff I want
to talk to Amanda about.</i>

05:29.996 --> 05:31.129
- No, girl. What...
- [chuckles]

05:31.331 --> 05:32.597
Really? No.

05:32.665 --> 05:34.933
Just some fruit smoothies.
They're just, you know, healthy.

05:34.935 --> 05:36.568
They're good
for meal replacements

05:36.570 --> 05:39.671
- if you have enough vitamins and stuff in 'em.
- Yeah.

05:58.991 --> 06:01.159
You're my guinea pig. I never
made 'em, I never tasted 'em,

06:01.161 --> 06:02.227
we're gonna do [bleep] together.

06:02.229 --> 06:04.529
I am the middle sibling.

06:04.531 --> 06:06.932
So it goes, Misty, Chris,
Amanda, Tammy and Amy.

06:06.934 --> 06:09.701
Basically, when my mom had
my big brother and my big sister,

06:09.703 --> 06:13.372
she was just testing them and
then I come along with all my glory.

06:16.109 --> 06:19.344
So I mean, this was my mom
at her finest when she had me.

06:20.480 --> 06:22.147
It don't smell bad.

06:25.451 --> 06:27.319
- Nope. Mm-mm.
- [gags]

06:28.388 --> 06:30.222
<i>I'm blunt, sarcastic.</i>

06:30.224 --> 06:33.191
<i>I don't wanna say I'm the glue
that holds the family together, but</i>

06:33.193 --> 06:34.926
I'm usually the one
that everybody calls for,

06:34.928 --> 06:36.161
"you know,
five minute bitch fest,"

06:36.163 --> 06:37.629
whenever everybody gets into it.

06:38.898 --> 06:41.633
-Come on, girl. I get the brown chair.
-Okay.

06:43.336 --> 06:44.569
How's Tam-Tam doing?

06:46.939 --> 06:48.140
Oh, Lord Jesus!

06:48.142 --> 06:52.511
<i>[Tammy] My ex-boyfriend
has been harassing me.</i>

06:55.748 --> 06:58.383
<i>I've got the police involved.</i>

07:03.956 --> 07:05.290
[sighs in exasperation]
Her head...

07:05.292 --> 07:07.058
Her head-space is not cleared.

07:07.060 --> 07:10.061
Tammy, wants so badly
to be in a relationship

07:10.063 --> 07:13.899
<i>that she is willing to let people
come in and take advantage of her.</i>

07:13.901 --> 07:15.901
She's looking for love in
all the wrong places, honey.

07:15.903 --> 07:18.270
How is her weight loss
journey going?

07:18.272 --> 07:21.373
Do you think that she's going
to be successful at this check-in

07:21.375 --> 07:22.407
or, what do you think?

07:30.716 --> 07:32.250
At this point,

07:32.318 --> 07:35.153
with Tammy and her health and her
weight loss journey, I'm really concerned.

07:35.155 --> 07:37.088
<i>I think she's just
really struggling,</i>

07:37.090 --> 07:38.957
and it's scary, you know,
it's scary.

07:38.959 --> 07:41.560
And it's just not something
I wanna think about.

07:46.933 --> 07:48.600
Oh, yeah, girl.
Hell yeah. I'm on it.

07:49.001 --> 07:52.304
We should celebrate her life 'cause there's
been so many times that she's, you know,

08:06.919 --> 08:07.953
[scoffs]

08:08.387 --> 08:09.654
Yeah, like, what's on your mind?

08:10.957 --> 08:12.457
You wanna go see a stripper?

08:12.459 --> 08:13.625
I'd like to see a stripper.

08:14.861 --> 08:16.061
[both laugh]

08:16.395 --> 08:18.029
That's a mental image.

08:18.031 --> 08:20.365
Bitch I don't want
that mental image.

08:20.367 --> 08:23.502
- But, you know that she's pansexual.
- Yeah.

08:23.504 --> 08:25.036
What if we can get some, maybe,

08:25.038 --> 08:27.138
some drag queens to
come in and do a drag show?

08:27.140 --> 08:29.341
Or, I mean, we either find
somebody to cater

08:29.343 --> 08:31.977
and all of us get together
and do it...

08:31.979 --> 08:33.945
Or we can try and go to, um,

08:33.947 --> 08:36.081
maybe some place up
in Evansville.

08:36.083 --> 08:38.817
There's this place called Bokeh
Lounge up there. It's really a nice setup.

08:38.819 --> 08:41.186
Everybody could talk and mingle

08:41.188 --> 08:44.089
and, you know,
just have a good time.

08:44.091 --> 08:46.391
<i>Me and Amy are planning
this little birthday party for her</i>

08:46.393 --> 08:48.727
<i>and, I mean, hopefully
she'll feel so much love that</i>

08:48.729 --> 08:50.161
maybe a light switch will flip

08:50.163 --> 08:53.331
and she'll feel the love for
herself that we all feel for her.

08:56.469 --> 08:59.104
- You're talking about a family vacation?
- Yeah.

08:59.106 --> 09:01.773
What about like, in three weeks

09:01.775 --> 09:06.044
and that will give Chris time
to ask for the vacation and...

09:06.046 --> 09:09.614
I don't care what we do as long as
we're together and it's been [bleep],

09:09.616 --> 09:14.019
probably, what, 20, 30 years since
we've all been staying in the same place?

09:16.455 --> 09:19.057
This might be something we can
use to encourage her to lose weight.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.293
Hey, sis, let's plan a vacation.

09:21.295 --> 09:23.628
Let's see how much fun
we can have on this one.

09:23.630 --> 09:26.331
If you lose the weight,
let's plan a big vacation.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.633
Yeah, I mean,
that's a great idea.

09:28.635 --> 09:30.702
At this point,
we're willing to do anything

09:30.704 --> 09:32.904
to help Tammy lose this weight.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.240
Even if it is to go
on a family road trip.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.309
<i>And to be honest with you,</i>

09:37.311 --> 09:39.511
<i>you never know
what the future holds.</i>

09:39.513 --> 09:42.147
You know, we're not
guaranteed tomorrow, people.

09:50.623 --> 09:51.957
[bleep]

09:51.959 --> 09:53.525
I'm ready for this.

09:55.261 --> 09:57.629
[guitar music playing]

10:03.035 --> 10:04.269
[Chris speaking]

10:07.640 --> 10:09.174
<i>I'm worried about Tammy</i>

10:09.176 --> 10:11.443
but for me, myself,
I'm kinda excited to see

10:11.445 --> 10:13.511
what the scale says
after 30 days.

10:15.114 --> 10:18.016
- All right, Tammy.
- All right.

10:18.018 --> 10:20.352
- You want the wheelchair to walk with?
- No.

10:20.354 --> 10:22.654
Or you just gonna walk
straight on in there?

10:42.642 --> 10:44.042
[breathing heavily]

10:44.044 --> 10:47.145
Chris, come on back.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.980
<i>[Tammy] And I haven't
been doing everything thing</i>

10:48.982 --> 10:51.182
I should be doing for
<i>this weigh in.</i>

11:00.960 --> 11:02.427
- What's up guys.
- Hi.

11:02.429 --> 11:04.095
- How is it going--
- How are you man.

11:04.097 --> 11:05.163
You look tired.

11:06.032 --> 11:07.065
[Eric Smith] Yeah.

11:07.199 --> 11:09.267
<i>[Chris] Until my body
gets used to having</i>

11:09.269 --> 11:11.503
<i>a 1,000 calories every day</i>

11:11.505 --> 11:14.005
<i>I'll be having
a little fatigue going on.</i>

11:14.007 --> 11:16.341
They said,
"It would get better in time."

11:16.343 --> 11:18.476
But that damn sure
can't get it quick enough.

11:19.278 --> 11:22.681
Because I'm just tired
of being tired.

11:22.683 --> 11:24.516
Um, what kind of things
are you eating right now?

11:24.518 --> 11:27.185
Like solids you're
experimenting with right now?

11:28.020 --> 11:29.187
Beef and gravy.

11:29.321 --> 11:30.288
Okay. Um--

11:36.295 --> 11:38.163
So Chris mentions to me
that beef and gravy

11:38.165 --> 11:40.065
are something
that he's able to eat.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.432
You know, that's
a little concerning to me

11:41.434 --> 11:46.137
because gravy to means, gravy
made with flour, high-fat contents

11:46.139 --> 11:51.176
and so I need him to now be very
aware to not fill up with bad calories.

11:51.178 --> 11:54.879
<i>The danger would be Chris
not just losing enough weight.</i>

11:54.881 --> 11:56.948
Now is about that time
where people start feeling

11:56.950 --> 11:58.083
like their freedom
is coming back

11:58.085 --> 12:00.151
and they are
able to tolerate stuff.

12:00.153 --> 12:03.621
But you got to make sure that
you're getting good quality calories.

12:03.623 --> 12:05.123
- You know, because--
- Yeah.

12:05.125 --> 12:07.225
[Eric] What happens is you're
so excited to get to chew on stuff

12:07.227 --> 12:09.260
and eat things. Umm...

12:09.262 --> 12:10.795
But you don't wanna
lose sight, that...

12:10.797 --> 12:13.098
Okay, what's the
nutritional value in this?

12:13.100 --> 12:15.233
Am I getting a lot of extra
calories that I don't need.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.234
I am.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.470
Umm... we are gonna see
what you weigh.

12:18.472 --> 12:20.805
- Yeah, I guess.
- [Eric] Let's do it.

12:20.807 --> 12:21.939
Here we go.

12:23.075 --> 12:27.278
Before surgery, Chris
weighed in at 408 pounds.

12:27.280 --> 12:31.483
<i>One month after surgery, I would
expect Chris to have lost 20 pounds.</i>

12:31.485 --> 12:33.985
<i>And that's what I hope
to see from Chris.</i>

12:47.967 --> 12:50.969
Alright so, 383.5 pounds.

12:52.838 --> 12:54.773
I'm like, wow!

12:54.775 --> 12:57.575
<i>I lost 25 pounds in a month.</i>

13:00.112 --> 13:02.547
[Eric] So this is just a taste
of how far you can take this.

13:03.949 --> 13:05.984
That's right. That's good.

13:07.153 --> 13:09.320
And I'll be honest with you.
I'll warn you.

13:09.322 --> 13:11.156
Right now,
the weights falling off

13:11.158 --> 13:13.358
and then you
eventually hit that plateau

13:13.360 --> 13:16.561
and how you break through that
is your activity.

13:16.962 --> 13:18.029
You can say okay.

13:18.031 --> 13:19.898
I'm gonna take time out
of my day.

13:19.900 --> 13:23.001
Whether it be 15-20 minutes
to get my heartrate up.

13:23.003 --> 13:26.137
Going for walks
doing body weight squats,

13:26.139 --> 13:28.940
doing some light weights
as you start easing into that.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.341
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

13:30.343 --> 13:32.644
- Alright man, you guys take care okay.
- Have a good day.

13:32.646 --> 13:34.078
Alright.

13:34.080 --> 13:37.916
Now I got to work out 15
minutes a day for the rest of my life.

13:37.918 --> 13:39.317
But that's not easy.

13:42.121 --> 13:45.490
Which is like...
do it for minute, stop.

13:45.492 --> 13:46.991
[laughs]

14:04.643 --> 14:05.577
Tammy.

14:37.910 --> 14:39.310
There is gonna be an edge to it.

14:39.312 --> 14:40.445
Or it should be.

14:45.217 --> 14:47.552
Hi Tammy, how are you?

14:49.188 --> 14:51.289
Well, that's better than
the alternative, isn't it?

14:51.891 --> 14:52.991
Okay, alright.

14:52.993 --> 14:54.525
- [Tammy chuckles]
- How are you feeling?

14:55.895 --> 14:58.329
Tired? Okay.
Well, I'll tell you what?

14:58.898 --> 15:00.231
Let's not beat around the bush.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.467
Let's get you on that scale,
let's see where we are

15:03.202 --> 15:04.535
and go from there. Okay?

15:07.373 --> 15:09.007
That's what we are here for.
Right?

15:09.775 --> 15:11.943
Okay, alright. Let's do it.

15:11.945 --> 15:13.478
Come up here
and let's see where we are at.

15:30.663 --> 15:33.164
This is going to be a fun trip.

15:33.166 --> 15:36.134
We are going on
a family vacation y'all!

15:36.268 --> 15:38.803
My God! Finally!

15:38.805 --> 15:41.272
[Chris] So are you gonna
try to walk in? You ready.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.213
Let's not beat around the bush.

15:49.215 --> 15:51.549
Let's get you on the scale,
let's see where we are.

15:56.355 --> 15:59.657
Last time I weighed in,
I weighed in at 639.

16:13.205 --> 16:15.673
[Eric] 649.5 pounds.

16:18.243 --> 16:19.544
You can go ahead
and have a seat.

16:35.661 --> 16:38.496
[Eric] So we had a goal
to lose 25 pounds.

16:39.865 --> 16:42.233
And we are up 10. So...

16:43.669 --> 16:46.137
I really need to--
You to tell me

16:46.139 --> 16:48.373
what's truly-- and be honest.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.108
What's going through
your head right now?

16:56.215 --> 16:57.382
Do you care?

16:58.250 --> 16:59.584
[Eric] Hm?

17:01.920 --> 17:05.123
So we talked about some
things to work on from last time.

17:05.125 --> 17:06.524
I gave you a food journal.

17:07.459 --> 17:08.593
Did you bring that
with you today?

17:10.195 --> 17:11.629
No. Okay.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.165
Have you written anything in it?

17:15.968 --> 17:17.568
[Eric] Alright,
so if you brought--

17:20.939 --> 17:22.173
You couldn't remember to do it?

17:24.343 --> 17:27.078
You're gonna have to explain
that to me, I don't get that.

17:30.015 --> 17:31.382
So it wasn't a priority?

17:33.285 --> 17:37.622
Um... we talked about doing 75
steps a day and going up by five

17:37.624 --> 17:40.958
and these we the goals we did
before too. How are we doing on those?

17:42.928 --> 17:45.563
Okay. Not doing them at all?

17:47.966 --> 17:50.168
So I would assume
that wasn't a priority either.

17:53.172 --> 17:55.073
<i>I'm pretty frustrated today
with Tammy.</i>

17:55.075 --> 17:57.341
I want Tammy to get success

17:57.343 --> 17:59.343
and I want Tammy to get healthy.

17:59.345 --> 18:03.181
But me wanting Tammy to meet those
goals is not gonna get Tammy there.

18:03.183 --> 18:05.016
Tammy has to want it.

18:05.018 --> 18:09.320
And Tammy is really not showing
me any evidence that she does want it.

18:10.022 --> 18:13.091
We also facilitated a therapist.

18:14.193 --> 18:16.494
[Eric] Okay. So how many times
did you go to the therapist?

18:24.736 --> 18:25.636
Okay.

18:37.282 --> 18:39.317
- [Eric] Okay.
- Not a... forget it.

18:39.319 --> 18:40.985
So you didn't set up
another meeting?

18:42.421 --> 18:44.088
Why didn't you tell me?

18:44.090 --> 18:45.957
You got my number
in your cell phone.

18:45.959 --> 18:49.193
Shoot me a text,
call me and say...

18:49.195 --> 18:52.763
here's the struggles
I'm having with my therapist.

18:52.765 --> 18:55.266
Because we've talked about
how important that part is.

18:55.268 --> 18:56.901
Even if this number
is going down,

18:56.903 --> 18:58.069
If we don't do that,

18:58.071 --> 19:00.171
we can put you
in a position to hurt yourself

19:00.173 --> 19:03.407
and do surgery on you if we do
not figure out a way to deal with

19:03.976 --> 19:05.376
your addictions and other issues

19:05.378 --> 19:07.245
that we both acknowledge
that you've got.

19:07.646 --> 19:09.080
You've got to want this.

19:09.082 --> 19:11.215
And ultimately
that's what priorities are.

19:11.217 --> 19:14.318
If you care about something
bad enough, it will be a priority.

19:14.320 --> 19:17.021
And if you don't...
it won't be a priority.

19:17.023 --> 19:18.990
It's really that simple.

19:20.192 --> 19:22.059
Chris, you got any ideas?

19:22.828 --> 19:25.296
She needs to focus on herself.

19:25.298 --> 19:27.932
And not worry
about relationships right now.

19:43.949 --> 19:46.184
[Eric] I completely agree
with you.

19:47.085 --> 19:50.955
Anybody who truly loves you,
wants what's best for you.

19:50.957 --> 19:53.791
And if this is the goal that
you want.

19:53.793 --> 19:57.295
They should be supporting you
100% to reach that goal.

19:59.398 --> 20:00.665
Why did you break up with him?

20:03.902 --> 20:04.936
Okay.

20:10.742 --> 20:11.642
And that makes sense.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.080
So here is
what I need you to do.

20:18.150 --> 20:20.418
When you've started doing the
things that I've asked you to do.

20:21.620 --> 20:22.753
You let me know.

20:22.755 --> 20:25.389
Then we'll bring you back
and weigh you.

20:25.391 --> 20:28.659
But, really. Until we start doing
these things that we talked about.

20:29.828 --> 20:31.062
What are we accomplishing?

20:32.864 --> 20:34.398
You're just burning gas.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.934
And exhausting yourself
taking a four hour trip.

20:39.137 --> 20:40.704
Ball is in your court.

20:44.042 --> 20:47.044
<i>You know today, I just had to be
really honest with Tammy and say this,</i>

20:47.046 --> 20:49.380
follow up with me
in four to six weeks

20:49.382 --> 20:53.084
when you actually start doing the
things that we've asked you to do.

20:53.086 --> 20:54.952
Show up for your therapist.

20:54.954 --> 20:58.189
<i>Do the steps log your
food journal and your diary.</i>

20:58.191 --> 21:00.057
<i>Until she wants this bad enough.</i>

21:00.059 --> 21:02.093
There is not much more
that we can do for her.

21:03.061 --> 21:05.229
You got to stop losing ground
Tammy.

21:05.231 --> 21:09.900
We're back up to that 650
range when I very first met you

21:09.902 --> 21:14.171
and losing all that progress
that you made in rehab.

21:16.308 --> 21:17.375
All right.

21:18.143 --> 21:19.443
I'll be right here.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.479
You let me know
when you are ready.

21:22.247 --> 21:24.048
- I'll see you guys okay.
- All right.

21:24.050 --> 21:25.182
I'll see you Tammy.

22:07.659 --> 22:09.126
Oh man! That looks good.

22:09.128 --> 22:10.995
Today we're
celebrating my birthday.

22:12.197 --> 22:13.531
She got a whole bowl of cereal.

22:15.100 --> 22:17.034
That's so fat!

22:17.036 --> 22:18.035
You get that to drink?

22:18.037 --> 22:19.470
It's breakfast.

22:31.817 --> 22:33.351
You ready to go see Aunt Tammy?

22:33.353 --> 22:35.820
She will give you a snack.

22:35.822 --> 22:38.055
There she is,
Tammy'll give you a snack.

22:38.323 --> 22:41.058
Tammy, I want a snack.

22:43.328 --> 22:45.296
My tea first,
I need my tea please.

22:58.076 --> 22:59.577
The faces you make.

23:00.078 --> 23:01.612
[chuckles]

23:02.614 --> 23:04.648
<i>Tammy's 35th birthday coming up</i>

23:04.650 --> 23:07.351
so I think it's time
to have a party.

23:07.353 --> 23:11.255
Because I know Tammy's been
a little stressed lately with all the

23:11.257 --> 23:13.524
break ups, the weight loss.

23:13.526 --> 23:15.626
The weight she didn't lose,
let's say.

23:16.027 --> 23:17.194
Okay.

23:17.196 --> 23:18.662
[Amy] Are you ready for
your birthday, bitch?

23:18.664 --> 23:20.331
I guess.

23:20.333 --> 23:22.967
You tell me what you got planned
then I'll tell you how I feel about it.

23:23.869 --> 23:25.936
But I was thinking of
a drag queen show.

23:25.938 --> 23:27.438
- [Tammy] Uh-uh.
- Yeah.

23:27.440 --> 23:30.040
I've always wanted to be
called to a drag show.

23:30.042 --> 23:32.510
Mumma's gonna get it on.

23:32.512 --> 23:36.947
<i>Me and Tammy are gonna go have
brunch with some drag queens.</i>

23:36.949 --> 23:39.650
And we about to get lit
on some mimosas, bitch.

23:48.927 --> 23:50.227
Okay.

23:50.229 --> 23:52.563
<i>I have my birthday coming up
in a few days.</i>

23:55.667 --> 23:58.636
Yeah, we'll get cake and
ice cream but that's about it.

23:58.638 --> 24:01.972
[Tammy] What? This birthday's
special I mean cause,

24:02.307 --> 24:04.375
I get to go see a drag show.

24:04.377 --> 24:07.978
Plus I get to have a sister,
girls night out.

24:09.047 --> 24:10.414
[knock on door]

24:10.416 --> 24:11.582
[Tammy] What's up?

24:12.250 --> 24:14.018
What y'all up to?

24:14.020 --> 24:16.253
Getting grains of
snack off my clothes.

24:16.255 --> 24:18.088
[Amy laughs]

24:18.090 --> 24:19.356
This is...

24:20.091 --> 24:22.092
For your birthday.

24:22.094 --> 24:24.829
I'm not gonna be able to make
it at Tammy's birthday party.

24:24.831 --> 24:27.865
<i>So, I'm bringing Tammy
a present for her birthday.</i>

24:27.867 --> 24:30.201
Go ahead, open your gift,
see what you got.

24:30.203 --> 24:31.669
'Cause I don't even know,
Brenda got it.

24:37.776 --> 24:39.343
<i>Tammy's turning 35.</i>

24:40.645 --> 24:43.681
<i>She's been told before,
she wouldn't make it past 30.</i>

24:43.683 --> 24:47.151
So I guess she's
a walking miracle as it is.

25:17.482 --> 25:20.518
I think it'll be a once in a life
time for all of us to get together,

25:20.520 --> 25:21.986
and go have fun.

25:23.555 --> 25:25.022
[Amy] Yeah!

25:35.534 --> 25:39.336
This is the whole point of trying
to get surgery and get healthy.

25:39.338 --> 25:41.939
So we can do stuff
we haven't done before.

25:41.941 --> 25:44.141
And this is one step
towards that.

26:03.194 --> 26:06.497
There's Chris, Misty,
Mandy, Amanda, Tammy and me.

26:16.908 --> 26:19.643
<i>I'm just excited to show my baby</i>

26:19.645 --> 26:22.146
Tennessee, the mountains
and stuff like that.

26:25.350 --> 26:28.185
I hope a black bear comes up
to the back porch.

26:46.338 --> 26:47.771
[Amy farts]

26:47.773 --> 26:49.173
[Tammy] Amy!

27:04.122 --> 27:05.222
- Something's messing up--
- Shut up.

27:05.224 --> 27:07.324
No you shut the [bleep] up.

27:08.360 --> 27:10.894
[Amy] Oh, I'm glad
we're almost here.

27:10.896 --> 27:13.330
We've got eight people
going to Gatlinburg.

27:22.207 --> 27:23.306
No, you shut the [bleep] up.

27:31.049 --> 27:33.951
This block. So I'm gonna go
this way, swing around.

27:33.953 --> 27:37.054
We gonna get crooked
up in this, bitch.

27:37.056 --> 27:39.790
So today's Tammy's
35th birthday...

27:39.792 --> 27:42.760
<i>normally we don't do much
for Tammy's birthday.</i>

27:42.762 --> 27:45.896
<i>This year since Tammy
has been going through a lot</i>

27:45.898 --> 27:48.165
<i>we wanted to do
something special for her.</i>

27:48.167 --> 27:51.935
Yes, Tammy did do bad
at her doctor's appointment.

27:51.937 --> 27:55.939
So I wanna do something big to
show that we love her and support her.

27:56.307 --> 27:57.608
And just honor her.

27:57.942 --> 27:59.109
So...

28:01.312 --> 28:04.214
<i>Tammy's pansexual so
she's gonna love this.</i>

28:04.216 --> 28:05.582
We're looking dumb as hell.

28:09.554 --> 28:11.955
Today we're celebrating
my birthday.

28:13.558 --> 28:15.359
Hey!

28:20.231 --> 28:22.366
I love you baby.

28:51.930 --> 28:54.698
Can I just get a Margarita?
Easy on the tequila.

28:54.700 --> 28:56.366
It makes my clothes fall off.

29:10.215 --> 29:13.117
Look at you girl, getting you
some veggies on the side.

29:13.119 --> 29:15.185
- Doing big things down there.
- It's spicy.

29:15.187 --> 29:17.087
Oh, man. That looks good.

29:17.089 --> 29:18.388
She got a whole bowl of cereal.

29:18.390 --> 29:20.224
[all laughing]

29:20.226 --> 29:22.292
- Amy really?
- That's so fat!

29:22.294 --> 29:24.995
- You get that to drink?
- [Amy] It's breakfast.

29:24.997 --> 29:27.965
[Tammy] Amy, she got a cereal
milkshake drink.

29:36.875 --> 29:38.809
The goal is still the same.

29:38.811 --> 29:40.711
To lose a hundred pounds.

29:40.713 --> 29:42.846
So I can get down to 150.

29:42.848 --> 29:45.415
Today's a cheat day,
today's a drunk day.

29:55.293 --> 29:57.127
How could you
forget to tell us that?

29:57.129 --> 29:58.729
So Bubba's come too?

29:58.731 --> 30:01.932
- [Amy] Yes.
- Oh, okay.

30:01.934 --> 30:03.934
So what is everybody
most excited to do?

30:03.936 --> 30:05.002
The aquarium.

30:05.670 --> 30:07.404
Oh, yeah!

30:07.406 --> 30:09.873
Do they have a camera with a
wide enough angle for all of us?

30:09.875 --> 30:12.276
I don't know 'cause that's a
lot of ass to be in one picture.

30:12.777 --> 30:14.178
<i>I'm super stoked,</i>

30:14.180 --> 30:17.281
but we'll really have to keep a
close eye on the cheat days, so

30:17.283 --> 30:20.117
nobody falls off
the wagon sort of thing.

30:38.169 --> 30:41.238
I had a peanut butter something.

30:41.240 --> 30:43.440
<i>Then I had a crunchy something.</i>

30:43.442 --> 30:46.043
Plus, I was sipping
everybody else's drink.

30:46.911 --> 30:49.246
Plus, I had two Bon Viagies.

30:49.248 --> 30:51.381
What is it, alohas, whatever.

30:53.284 --> 30:55.552
Last time I had a drink was

30:55.554 --> 30:58.155
before I got pregnant,
it was like, I don't know...

30:58.356 --> 30:59.990
2019.

31:04.863 --> 31:06.230
Bye.

31:06.232 --> 31:08.265
Look at my sister down there.

31:08.267 --> 31:09.433
Amy.

31:10.368 --> 31:11.602
Come back to us, girl.

31:14.105 --> 31:16.039
What do you look like?

31:16.041 --> 31:18.141
I cannot deal
with her like this.

31:18.143 --> 31:21.378
Amy, get your get right out...
Act right.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.013
Get your life together.

31:32.824 --> 31:35.359
Good morning Bokeh Lounge!

31:36.628 --> 31:39.062
We have a special gal
in the house this morning.

31:39.064 --> 31:42.232
It's her birthday,
I think I heard you're 35!

31:42.234 --> 31:43.934
Make some noise for Tammy.

31:43.936 --> 31:46.536
[crowd cheering]

31:46.538 --> 31:49.439
Alright, we're gonna get this show
started off for you. Make some noise.

31:49.441 --> 31:51.975
She is the gothic doll
of the district.

31:51.977 --> 31:53.577
Give it up for Slim Pickin's.

31:56.514 --> 31:59.650
[music playing]

32:00.952 --> 32:02.986
Okay. Okay. Okay.

32:08.793 --> 32:11.028
Get it girl, get it, get it.

32:20.872 --> 32:23.340
<i>[Amy] But I love
the drag queens.</i>

32:25.109 --> 32:26.443
The drinks.

32:26.445 --> 32:29.079
[cheering]

32:40.158 --> 32:44.227
[crowd cheering]

32:47.065 --> 32:48.565
- Ohh, get it, get it!
- [bleep]

32:48.567 --> 32:50.934
Go baby, go baby.

32:52.236 --> 32:54.304
Ay, hey.

32:55.073 --> 32:57.941
Okay, girl. Okay, okay.

32:57.943 --> 33:00.110
We see you. We see you, babe.

33:00.112 --> 33:02.346
I'm vibing. I'm vibing.

33:02.348 --> 33:04.014
She said, "I'm vibing."

33:04.016 --> 33:08.652
- Here's to being 35 [bleep].
- [all] Cheers!

33:11.089 --> 33:14.224
-Nobody heal. Pick it up speed.
-No. No, no, no, no.

33:14.226 --> 33:16.460
You survived, girl.
You made it.

33:16.462 --> 33:19.196
<i>We all know, the struggles
that my sister's had, to get here.</i>

33:19.198 --> 33:20.964
So her turning 35,

33:20.966 --> 33:24.901
such a blessing, and we are
so grateful that she made it to 35.

33:24.903 --> 33:27.804
<i>A few years ago,
Tammy got really, really sick.</i>

33:27.806 --> 33:30.807
And she was in the ICU
for a very long time.

33:30.809 --> 33:34.745
<i>And the doctor come out, and told me and
my siblings that we need to plan a funeral.</i>

33:34.747 --> 33:38.115
So, that was some years ago,
and now she's 35, so we celebrate,

33:38.117 --> 33:41.251
<i>you know, all the things that
we've been through, as a family.</i>

33:41.253 --> 33:42.619
<i>And she's still here.</i>

33:45.490 --> 33:47.124
[emotional music]

33:47.126 --> 33:48.959
I'm sorry, guys.

33:50.862 --> 33:53.697
I was actually 35,
when I had my gastric bypass.

33:53.699 --> 33:56.166
You've already seen
how much it's changed my life.

33:56.168 --> 33:58.935
So, my advice is,
we're all gonna work together,

33:58.937 --> 34:01.705
keep you, you know, motivated,

34:01.707 --> 34:06.209
to do the things that you need to
do, so you can have a better life, also.

34:06.211 --> 34:08.779
You know, I want you around
for a long time.

34:08.781 --> 34:10.180
Yeah, I'm the oldest,
you get to bury me first.

34:10.182 --> 34:12.783
Yeah, well.
I hope we all just stick,

34:12.785 --> 34:15.385
hell, let's just all go
together, if we got to go at all.

34:15.387 --> 34:19.056
But, yeah. Here's to
a healthy life for you.

34:19.058 --> 34:22.125
A new and improved Tammy.

34:22.127 --> 34:24.594
So let's make
this 35th year count.

34:24.596 --> 34:27.330
And let this be the one that
gets you where you need to be.

34:28.099 --> 34:30.867
<i>You know, for us siblings,
it's still very real.</i>

34:30.869 --> 34:33.136
It's like there's been so many
times that she almost didn't make it,

34:33.138 --> 34:35.372
and that's why
it's so important.

34:35.374 --> 34:38.375
We're selfish, and we
want her to stay here with us.

34:38.377 --> 34:40.077
And have a healthy life.

34:40.079 --> 34:42.946
And actually live life, instead of just
sitting around watching it pass her by.

34:42.948 --> 34:44.181
You know.

34:45.917 --> 34:47.884
<i>That's my little sister, I mean.</i>

34:47.886 --> 34:50.987
She's gotta look at herself in the
mirror and say, "bitch you are worth it."

34:51.989 --> 34:54.191
[all cheering]

34:54.193 --> 34:57.094
You're gonna blow, blow, blow,
blow, blow, blow, blow.

34:57.096 --> 34:58.261
One more. [all cheering]

35:08.940 --> 35:11.341
Cheers to Tammy's birthday.

35:11.343 --> 35:13.376
[all cheering and applauding]

35:16.080 --> 35:19.149
She wants the walker,
she'll walk up the ramp.

35:19.151 --> 35:20.917
I'm excited
to be here at the cabin.

35:20.919 --> 35:23.854
But yet, it's late.
And it's been a long ride.

35:23.856 --> 35:25.388
So are you gonna try to walk in?

35:31.162 --> 35:32.529
<i>What the hell?</i>

35:34.665 --> 35:36.666
[country music]

35:38.669 --> 35:41.304
-Hi, girl. You guys ready to go?
-Ready to go?

35:41.306 --> 35:43.640
You're just sitting here, like
you ain't got no place to be.

35:45.376 --> 35:51.648
So today, me Michael and Gage,
Misty, Chris, Amanda, Britney.

35:54.819 --> 35:57.821
But we're going on
a family vacation, y'all.

35:57.823 --> 36:00.457
This vacation has
come together so fast,

36:00.459 --> 36:04.327
that I'm really thankful because you
never know what can happen tomorrow.

36:10.234 --> 36:12.335
We got it all. We ready to go.

36:12.337 --> 36:14.237
We got to figure out where
all this shit's gonna go.

36:14.239 --> 36:15.972
Yeah.
That's the biggest thing.

36:18.176 --> 36:19.142
That's right. That works

36:19.144 --> 36:20.810
All right.
Let's get it together.

36:20.812 --> 36:22.746
Let's go, bye bye.

36:22.748 --> 36:24.814
There's a whole lot of factors
we need to consider

36:24.816 --> 36:27.884
on how to get Tammy
somewhere safely.

36:27.886 --> 36:30.887
Is she comfortable enough?
Does she have oxygen?

36:30.889 --> 36:34.257
<i>Walkers, wheelchairs, pain meds.</i>

36:41.032 --> 36:44.301
Suitcases, I guess.
And Tammy's chair.

36:44.303 --> 36:47.837
I realized, we got eight
people going to Gatlinburg

36:47.839 --> 36:49.906
<i>everybody's got four-five bags.</i>

36:49.908 --> 36:52.342
<i>Tammy's got a walker
and two different wheelchairs.</i>

36:52.344 --> 36:56.046
<i>And you know, you gotta bring
a ramp, for the wheelchair.</i>

36:56.048 --> 36:58.648
Chris, be careful lifting
all that stuff, it's heavy.

37:00.918 --> 37:03.453
Damn, girl, what you got in
here? That's heavy as truck.

37:03.455 --> 37:06.356
- How much room is left at the back of the minivan?
- None.

37:10.161 --> 37:12.529
Oh, there's three. [laughing]

37:21.839 --> 37:23.540
Shut the door.

37:24.008 --> 37:26.943
Go ahead, and shut that door. Amy, turn
your suitcase here, in the end all the way.

37:26.945 --> 37:28.011
Okay.

37:28.312 --> 37:31.014
Two cars, everybody loaded up.

37:39.056 --> 37:40.657
Misty, you got
any leg room back there?

37:40.659 --> 37:42.492
- Can you scoot this chair
back, just a-- - I'm good.

37:42.627 --> 37:44.227
[burps]

37:44.229 --> 37:48.265
I feel like my vehicle is gonna have
more fun because I'm gonna be in it.

37:48.267 --> 37:52.369
You know, Michael and Amy, they
got the husband and wife vibe going on.

37:52.371 --> 37:54.371
They vibing on that, we're
over here, vibing on [bleep]

37:54.373 --> 37:56.106
[laughs]

37:57.008 --> 37:59.442
This is gonna be a fun trip.

38:03.914 --> 38:07.150
You know, we should have made
Dad make Bologna salad to take with us.

38:07.152 --> 38:12.522
Bologna ground up, with onions, cheese,
miracle whip and and some sweet relish.

38:12.524 --> 38:14.124
Bologna salad is good, man.

38:14.325 --> 38:16.459
I could eat [bleep] of that.

38:16.461 --> 38:19.029
Can you all believe we're
going on vacation together?

38:19.031 --> 38:21.598
- No. No.
- I swear to [bleep].

38:23.868 --> 38:26.002
- Yeah.
- [laughing]

38:26.004 --> 38:28.371
And stiff, from not being
able to move around.

38:41.852 --> 38:43.987
It's got a grill
on the outside...

38:43.989 --> 38:45.422
- Cool.
- On the balcony.

38:45.424 --> 38:47.023
- And we got a hot tub?
- Yes.

38:47.025 --> 38:49.059
Oh, I hope they got
a big enough tub,

38:49.061 --> 38:52.062
cause I'm gonna take my fat ass
in there, I'm gonna soak in the tub.

38:52.064 --> 38:55.332
They ain't got no
Olympic size pool in the--

38:55.334 --> 38:58.535
Shut the hell up. That's what
you swim, bath in [bleep].

39:06.243 --> 39:08.411
Da-da-da.

39:08.413 --> 39:10.613
- Da-da-da-da-da-da.
- Da-da.

39:11.982 --> 39:14.551
Can you say Da-da? Say Daddy!

39:15.086 --> 39:16.119
Say Daddy!

39:16.121 --> 39:18.154
[baby cooing]

39:18.923 --> 39:20.523
Da-da-da-da-da-da.

39:21.826 --> 39:24.294
Gage, you're in a new state,
buddy.

39:24.296 --> 39:26.796
You've never been to
this state before.

39:26.798 --> 39:28.898
What I'm looking forward to,
the most,

39:28.900 --> 39:31.401
is like, just experience it
with Gage.

39:31.403 --> 39:34.871
This is his first,
real, big trip.

39:34.873 --> 39:37.107
And, I can't wait.

39:54.291 --> 39:57.260
You got some water in there,
and that's not in the cooler.

39:59.864 --> 40:02.332
Go ahead and pour that one in,
right there.

40:02.334 --> 40:04.367
We gonna need, probably about
two or three more of these.

40:09.940 --> 40:11.074
Okay, here we [bleep] go.

40:11.509 --> 40:13.977
Two hours later.

40:13.979 --> 40:16.379
[sighing] Finally.

40:19.250 --> 40:21.618
So, seriously, what are we
doing for supper tonight?

40:21.620 --> 40:23.253
'Cause I'm [bleep] hungry.

40:24.422 --> 40:26.055
- [laughing] - I don't eat
some damn crackers,

40:26.057 --> 40:28.057
don't shove it [bleep]
back here.

40:35.065 --> 40:37.066
Well, I'm, it's something,
messing up--

40:37.068 --> 40:39.002
- Shut up.
- No, you shut the [bleep] up.

40:39.170 --> 40:40.303
[bleep]

40:40.305 --> 40:42.939
- Oh, I'm glad we're almost here.
- [bleep]

40:46.210 --> 40:49.045
You bothering me, too,
when I ain't bitching at you.

40:50.481 --> 40:53.283
- No, you shut the [bleep] up.
- God dammit [bleep].

41:01.292 --> 41:04.060
Oh my God! Finally.

41:09.934 --> 41:12.168
I've never stayed in a cabin,

41:12.170 --> 41:15.171
let alone, this big ass place.

41:21.145 --> 41:23.746
Look at the beautiful place.

41:23.748 --> 41:26.216
Oh my God. There's a chair
Tammy can fit in.

41:29.220 --> 41:31.154
I'm excited to
be here at the cabin.

41:31.355 --> 41:33.556
But yet, it's late.

41:33.558 --> 41:36.960
I'm tired cause it's been
12 hours of driving.

41:36.962 --> 41:40.230
To be honest, I just wanna take
a shower, and pass the hell out.

41:48.973 --> 41:50.072
You ready?

41:50.174 --> 41:53.009
She wants the walker,
and she'll walk up the ramp.

42:04.288 --> 42:06.222
I'm so [bleep] scared.

42:25.209 --> 42:28.111
<i>[Chris] Next time on,
1,000-lb Sisters.</i>

42:28.113 --> 42:30.013
You're missing out
on a lot, just--

42:30.015 --> 42:31.247
I don't give a [bleep].

42:31.249 --> 42:34.317
Tammy is throwing
a tinter tantrum.

42:34.319 --> 42:38.087
I really don't feel good,
and I didn't wanna come.

42:41.025 --> 42:44.260
I'll [bleep] let you know when
I need a god damn ambulance.

42:44.995 --> 42:47.063
This is ridiculous.

42:51.735 --> 42:54.938
[laughing] It actually fits
your personality to a T.

42:54.940 --> 42:57.206
<i>Just 'cause we're having
a little thing, with Tammy,</i>

42:57.208 --> 43:01.077
don't mean we can't enjoy the
day and go get us a family photo.

43:01.645 --> 43:02.979
[camera clicking] That's good.

43:02.981 --> 43:04.080
Woo.

43:04.082 --> 43:06.316
Let's get you
strapped in here safely.

43:06.318 --> 43:11.854
The rollercoaster is something Chris
has been wanting to do, for 20 years.

43:11.856 --> 43:13.389
Can you sit up taller for me?

43:13.391 --> 43:15.058
- I can't. That's it.
- You can't? That's it? Okay.

43:15.060 --> 43:16.659
Sorry about that.

43:16.661 --> 43:21.064
It never [bleep] fails, she's got to
make it about her on every [bleep] trip.

43:25.903 --> 43:28.905
Let's go, get this [bleep] over with
'cause I'm not [bleep] with Tammy no more.

43:28.907 --> 43:31.207
Anything's possible,
when we get in this room.

43:31.209 --> 43:33.076
They start talking to Tammy.

43:34.979 --> 43:37.380
I will literally flip [bleep].

43:37.815 --> 43:39.248
<i>Maybe if dinner does great,</i>

43:39.250 --> 43:42.218
she'll wanna stay a couple of
days, and have some fun with us.

43:42.220 --> 43:43.786
She's the one
that's acting like a dummy.

43:43.788 --> 43:44.921
How about you just shut up
for once?

43:44.923 --> 43:46.990
Why don't you get off that
[bleep] chair and make me?

43:46.992 --> 43:48.558
- I [bleep] will, bitch.
- Get the [bleep] up then.

43:48.560 --> 43:50.460
You won't shut up!

43:50.462 --> 43:53.563
How am I supposed to [bleep]
say anything, if you keep [bleep]?
