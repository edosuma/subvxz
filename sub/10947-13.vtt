<i>And although
his airbending skills are great,</i>

before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

Absolutely not.

01:21.250 --> 01:24.090
Your request is denied,
Commander Zhao.

01:24.380 --> 01:27.800
Colonel Shinu, please reconsider.

01:28.130 --> 01:30.010
Their precision is legendary.

01:30.100 --> 01:33.060
The Yuyan can pin a fly
to a tree from 100 yards away

01:33.140 --> 01:34.680
without killing it.

01:37.100 --> 01:40.690
You're wasting their talents
using them as mere security guards.

01:40.770 --> 01:43.320
I can do whatever I want
with their talents.

01:43.400 --> 01:46.280
They're my archers,
and what I say goes.

01:46.530 --> 01:48.360
But my search for the Avatar is―

01:48.450 --> 01:50.870
Is nothing but a vanity project.

01:51.030 --> 01:52.870
We're fighting a real war here,

01:52.950 --> 01:55.450
and I need every man
I've got, commander.

01:55.540 --> 01:56.580
But―

01:56.660 --> 01:57.660
That's final!

01:57.750 --> 01:59.620
I don't want to hear
another word about it.

about Appa the most?

02:47.920 --> 02:49.300
His sense of humor.

02:49.590 --> 02:50.680
That's nice.

02:50.760 --> 02:51.760
I'll tell him.

02:53.640 --> 02:54.640
Ha ha ha!

02:54.720 --> 02:56.010
Classic Appa.

02:56.100 --> 02:57.180
How's Sokka doing?

02:57.270 --> 02:58.480
Not so good.

02:58.560 --> 02:59.770
Being out in that storm

02:59.850 --> 03:00.890
really did a number on him.

03:01.520 --> 03:03.150
( SHIVERING )

03:04.480 --> 03:06.690
I couldn't find
any ginger root for the tea,

03:06.780 --> 03:08.230
but I found a map.

03:08.320 --> 03:09.570
There's a herbalist institute

03:09.650 --> 03:11.070
on the top of that mountain.

03:11.150 --> 03:12.950
We could probably
find a cure for Sokka there.

03:13.370 --> 03:15.620
Aang, he's in no condition to travel.

03:15.700 --> 03:17.330
Sokka just needs more rest.

03:17.580 --> 03:19.410
I'm sure he'll be better by tomorrow.

03:19.910 --> 03:21.960
( COUGHING )

03:23.710 --> 03:24.880
Not you, too.

03:25.210 --> 03:27.170
Relax. It was just a little cough.

03:27.250 --> 03:28.250
I'm fin―

03:28.340 --> 03:29.960
( COUGHING )

03:34.840 --> 03:36.550
That's how Sokka started yesterday.

03:36.640 --> 03:37.810
Now look at him.

03:37.890 --> 03:39.350
He thinks he's an earthbender.

03:39.770 --> 03:41.940
Take that, you rock.

03:43.060 --> 03:45.520
A few more hours
and you'll be talking nonsense, too.

03:45.610 --> 03:46.980
I'm going to find some medicine.

03:53.530 --> 03:56.370
Uh, maybe it's safer if I go on foot.

03:56.450 --> 03:57.780
Keep an eye on them, guys.

04:00.410 --> 04:01.620
Ha ha!

04:01.700 --> 04:03.160
You guys are killing me.

04:15.930 --> 04:18.850
We haven't been able to pick up
the Avatar's trail since the storm,

04:19.310 --> 04:21.890
but if we continue
heading northeast...

04:23.560 --> 04:24.730
What do they want?

04:24.810 --> 04:27.900
Perhaps a sporting game of Pai Sho.

04:33.280 --> 04:34.490
The hunt for the Avatar

04:34.570 --> 04:35.950
has been given prime importance.

04:36.360 --> 04:37.910
All information regarding the Avatar

04:37.990 --> 04:40.240
must be reported
directly to Admiral Zhao.

04:40.740 --> 04:42.580
Zhao has been promoted?

04:42.660 --> 04:44.870
Well, good for him.

04:45.750 --> 04:47.960
I've got nothing to report to Zhao.

04:48.040 --> 04:50.500
Now get off my ship and let us pass.

04:51.090 --> 04:52.760
Admiral Zhao is not allowing ships

04:52.840 --> 04:54.380
in or out of this area.

04:55.090 --> 04:56.680
Off my ship!

04:57.430 --> 04:58.930
Excellent.

04:59.930 --> 05:01.510
I take the pot.

05:02.310 --> 05:04.060
But you're all improving.

05:04.140 --> 05:07.060
I'm certain you will win
if we play again.

05:13.150 --> 05:15.650
It says here
that the Avatar can create tornadoes

05:15.740 --> 05:17.160
and run faster than the wind.

05:17.240 --> 05:18.660
Pretty amazing.

05:18.740 --> 05:21.870
Aw, that's just a bunch
of Fire Lord propaganda.

05:21.950 --> 05:23.620
There's no way that's true.

Listen carefully, Momo.

05:44.720 --> 05:48.900
I need you to take this
to the river and fill it with water.

05:49.810 --> 05:51.610
( HEARING GIBBERISH )

05:54.150 --> 05:55.150

06:14.590 --> 06:16.460
Hello. I'm sorry
to barge in like this,

06:16.550 --> 06:18.510
but I need some medicine
for my friends.

06:18.590 --> 06:20.090
They have fevers
and they've been coughing―

06:20.180 --> 06:22.100
Settle down, young man.

06:22.180 --> 06:25.100
Your friends are going to be fine.

06:25.390 --> 06:29.140
I've been up here
for over 40 years, you know.

06:29.230 --> 06:32.690
Used to be others,
but they all left years ago.

06:33.020 --> 06:35.860
Now it's just me and Miyuki.

06:36.650 --> 06:37.780
That's nice.

06:37.860 --> 06:42.120
Wounded Earth Kingdom troops
still come by now and again.

06:42.200 --> 06:43.830
Brave boys,

06:43.910 --> 06:45.870
and thanks to my remedies,

06:45.950 --> 06:49.460
they always leave in better shape
than when they arrived.

06:49.790 --> 06:51.420
That's nice. Are you almost done?

06:51.790 --> 06:52.880
Hold on.

06:52.960 --> 06:55.880
I just need to add
one last ingredient.

06:56.590 --> 06:58.630
Oh, sandalwood?

06:58.720 --> 07:00.930
Oh, yes― No, that won't do.

07:01.010 --> 07:03.090
Banana leaf? Eh, nope.

07:03.510 --> 07:04.850
Ginger root?

07:04.930 --> 07:06.010
Uh-uh.

07:06.100 --> 07:08.270
Oh, where is that pesky little plant?

07:15.400 --> 07:16.860
Is everything ok?

07:17.360 --> 07:19.070
It's been almost an hour

07:19.150 --> 07:21.740
and you haven't given
the men an order.

07:22.070 --> 07:23.320
I don't care what they do.

07:23.740 --> 07:25.530
Don't give up hope yet.

07:25.620 --> 07:28.120
You can still find the Avatar
before Zhao.

07:28.620 --> 07:29.750
How, uncle?

07:29.830 --> 07:30.830
With Zhao's resources,

07:30.910 --> 07:32.170
it's just a matter of time

07:32.250 --> 07:33.670
before he captures the Avatar.

07:34.130 --> 07:37.210
My honor, my throne, my country―

07:37.300 --> 07:38.840
I'm about to lose them all.

07:41.800 --> 07:44.640
Oh, here's what I was looking for.

07:45.180 --> 07:46.930
Plum blossom.

07:47.850 --> 07:50.220
Finally. Thanks for all your help.

07:50.310 --> 07:51.310
Hands off.

07:51.390 --> 07:53.230
What do you think you're doing?

07:53.310 --> 07:54.600
Taking the cure to my friends.

07:55.100 --> 07:57.440
Oh! Ha ha! This isn't a cure.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.280
It's Miyuki's dinner.

07:59.530 --> 08:01.990
Plum blossom is her favorite.

08:02.070 --> 08:03.610
What about my friends?

08:03.700 --> 08:07.330
Well, all they need
is some frozen wood frogs.

08:07.410 --> 08:09.740
There's plenty of them
down in the valley swamp.

08:10.040 --> 08:12.250
What am I supposed to do
with frozen frogs?

08:12.330 --> 08:14.370
Why, suck on them, of course.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.080
Suck on them?

08:16.170 --> 08:18.590
The frog skin excretes a substance

08:18.670 --> 08:20.300
that'll cure your friends,

08:20.380 --> 08:22.420
but make sure you get plenty.

08:22.840 --> 08:24.720
Once those little critters thaw out,

08:24.800 --> 08:25.890
they're useless.

08:27.720 --> 08:29.100
You're insane, aren't you?

08:29.180 --> 08:30.640
That's right.

08:32.230 --> 08:34.390
Well, don't stand there all day.

08:34.480 --> 08:36.020
Go!

08:39.480 --> 08:40.480
Uh! Whoa!

08:53.250 --> 08:55.250
Uh, I think you dropped this.

09:07.220 --> 09:08.640
Aah!

09:49.220 --> 09:50.260
A frog!

10:30.340 --> 10:32.680
So this is the great Avatar,

10:32.760 --> 10:35.520
master of all the elements.

10:36.020 --> 10:37.930
I don't know how
you've managed to elude

10:38.020 --> 10:40.190
the Fire Nation for 100 years,

10:40.480 --> 10:44.270
but your little game
of hide and seek is over.

10:44.520 --> 10:45.980
I've never hidden from you.

10:46.070 --> 10:47.900
Untie me and I'll fight you right now.

10:48.280 --> 10:50.070
Uh, no.

10:50.660 --> 10:54.780
Tell me, how does it feel
to be the only airbender left?

10:55.410 --> 10:57.500
Do you miss your people?

10:58.580 --> 11:00.410
Oh, don't worry.

11:00.500 --> 11:02.330
You won't be killed like they were.

11:02.960 --> 11:05.000
See, if you die, you'll just be reborn

11:05.090 --> 11:06.380
and the Fire Nation will have to begin

11:06.460 --> 11:09.050
its search for the Avatar
all over again.

11:09.510 --> 11:13.800

but just barely.

11:20.020 --> 11:21.690

Hold your fire!

19:16.410 --> 19:18.450
The Avatar must be captured alive.

19:25.340 --> 19:26.420
Open the gate.

19:26.880 --> 19:28.420
Admiral, what are you doing?

19:28.510 --> 19:29.550
Let them out.

19:29.630 --> 19:30.630
Now!

19:33.930 --> 19:35.510
How could you let them go?

19:35.600 --> 19:40.180
A situation like this requires...
Precision.

19:54.950 --> 19:56.280
Do you have a clear shot?

19:58.490 --> 19:59.870
Knock out the thief.

20:00.500 --> 20:04.080
I'll deliver him to the Fire Lord
along with the Avatar.

20:19.100 --> 20:20.520
Quick! Recover the Avatar!

20:45.580 --> 20:46.580
( CROAKS )

21:05.100 --> 21:06.310
You know what the worst part

21:06.400 --> 21:08.810
about being born
over 100 years ago is?

21:09.360 --> 21:11.360
I miss all the friends
I used to hang out with.

21:11.780 --> 21:13.360
Before the war started,

21:13.440 --> 21:15.650
I used to always
visit my friend, Kuzon.

21:15.740 --> 21:17.660
The two of us, we'd get in and out

21:17.740 --> 21:20.120
of so much trouble together.

21:20.200 --> 21:22.740
He was one of the best friends
I ever had...

21:22.830 --> 21:25.870
And he was from the Fire Nation,
just like you.

21:26.500 --> 21:28.080
If we knew each other back then,

21:28.170 --> 21:30.040
do you think
we could have been friends, too?

21:52.070 --> 21:53.940
Where have you been, Prince Zuko?

21:54.030 --> 21:55.610
You missed music night.

21:55.940 --> 21:59.660
Lieutenant Jee sang
a stirring love song.

21:59.990 --> 22:01.740
I'm going to bed.

22:01.830 --> 22:02.950
No disturbances.

22:06.080 --> 22:09.290
( PLAYING INSTRUMENT )

22:15.050 --> 22:16.170
Suck on these.

22:16.260 --> 22:17.590
It'll make you feel better.

22:20.220 --> 22:22.850
Aang, how was your trip?

22:22.930 --> 22:24.850
Did you make any new friends?

22:25.140 --> 22:26.140
No.

22:26.230 --> 22:27.270
I don't think I did.

22:44.160 --> 22:45.160
Mm!

22:45.240 --> 22:46.950
This is tasty.

22:47.040 --> 22:48.250
Mm, mm!

22:48.330 --> 22:49.370
( CROAKS )

22:50.210 --> 22:51.210
Ptooey!

22:51.290 --> 22:52.330
Aah!
