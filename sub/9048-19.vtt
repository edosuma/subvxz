00:01.456 --> 00:02.589
- Previously on <i>Awkward...</i>

00:02.591 --> 00:03.624
You applied to college?

00:03.626 --> 00:04.691
Why didn't you tell me?

00:04.693 --> 00:05.626
- I didn't tell anyone.

00:05.628 --> 00:06.794
- We make a great team.
- Totally.

00:06.796 --> 00:09.696
- I'm glad we're hanging out
because I like you, Jenna.

00:09.698 --> 00:13.100
- Gabby's a really cool girl.
- Yeah, she is.

00:13.102 --> 00:14.902
So are you.

00:17.305 --> 00:18.539
- Senior year
was two-thirds over,

00:18.541 --> 00:19.940
and I still hadn't been
accepted to college.

00:19.942 --> 00:22.442
Thankfully, spring break
was right around the corner,

00:22.444 --> 00:24.578
so I'd have plenty
of quality time

00:24.580 --> 00:26.280
to wallow in self-pity.

00:26.282 --> 00:27.281
- Great news!

00:27.283 --> 00:28.248
Ally rented a beach house

00:28.250 --> 00:30.651
in Rosarito, Mexico,
for spring break,

00:30.653 --> 00:32.853
and the whole family
is invited.

00:32.855 --> 00:36.557
We are going spring breaking!

00:36.559 --> 00:38.525
- Spring break with Sadie:
Pass.

00:38.527 --> 00:39.793
- Well, you can bring Tamara.

00:39.795 --> 00:40.828
Ally said the house is huge,

00:40.830 --> 00:42.296
and Sadie's invited
lots of friends

00:42.298 --> 00:43.764
to celebrate
her acceptance to Columbia.

00:43.766 --> 00:46.967
And I think I'm gonna have
a Tequila shot for breakfast.

00:46.969 --> 00:47.935
- That's great, mom.

00:47.937 --> 00:49.536
You and Sadie have
a lot to celebrate,

00:49.538 --> 00:51.438
what, with you both going
to college in the fall.

00:51.440 --> 00:54.908
- Yeah, can you just keep
that stuff between us for now?

00:54.910 --> 00:56.009
- You still haven't told him?

00:56.011 --> 00:58.645
- I'm waiting
for the right time.

00:58.647 --> 00:59.379
- Time for what?

00:59.381 --> 01:01.315
- Someone in this room
got into Lockard College.

01:01.317 --> 01:03.584
- Oh, thank God.
I didn't want to say anything,

01:03.586 --> 01:05.819
but if you weren't accepted
anywhere by spring break,

01:05.821 --> 01:08.555
I was really going
to start to worry.

01:08.557 --> 01:10.924
- Oh.

01:10.926 --> 01:12.459
Not me.

01:14.762 --> 01:16.730
- Surprise!

01:22.303 --> 01:23.303
- What the hell is going on?

01:23.305 --> 01:26.573
- When I was visiting campuses
with Jenna this fall,

01:26.575 --> 01:27.474
I started thinking,

01:27.476 --> 01:28.675
"is it really too late for me?"

01:28.677 --> 01:29.509
- Yes.
- What?

01:29.511 --> 01:30.878
You applied to college
without telling me?

01:30.880 --> 01:34.381
- Because if I didn't get in,
there would be nothing to tell.

01:34.383 --> 01:35.749
But... I got in.

01:35.751 --> 01:39.987
- So you're gonna commute
or pledge a sorority, or what?

01:39.989 --> 01:41.788
Aren't you a little old
for all of that?

01:41.790 --> 01:43.323
- Yeah, mom,
if you want to party,

01:43.325 --> 01:45.492
why don't you just
join the country club

01:45.494 --> 01:47.361
like all the other normal moms?

01:47.363 --> 01:49.796
- I do not want to party.

01:49.798 --> 01:51.565
I want a career.

01:51.567 --> 01:53.634
I think I might
become a fixer.

01:53.636 --> 01:54.768
- A fixer?

01:54.770 --> 01:55.736
That's a career?

01:55.738 --> 01:56.937
- Yes, you call a fixer

01:56.939 --> 01:58.472
when you're in real deep.

01:58.474 --> 02:00.741
And they make all kinds
of secret phone calls

02:00.743 --> 02:02.476
to the police and press--
whoever.

02:02.478 --> 02:04.912
- Mom, that's not a career,
that's a TV show.

02:04.914 --> 02:07.781
- Lace, you don't really
have to go.

02:07.783 --> 02:10.050
I mean, it's enough
that you got in.

02:10.052 --> 02:11.919
I am proud of you.

02:11.921 --> 02:13.553
- Oh, no.

02:13.555 --> 02:14.521
I'm going.

02:14.523 --> 02:16.723
I just need to do
a little more research.

02:16.725 --> 02:18.859
I call the TV tonight.

02:20.361 --> 02:20.961
- Look at her,

02:20.963 --> 02:24.564
holding court like some
newly engaged Kardashian.

02:24.566 --> 02:25.699
Congrats, Sadie.

02:25.701 --> 02:26.867
- Yeah, congrats.

02:26.869 --> 02:27.768
- Right back at you,

02:27.770 --> 02:31.905
if you ever get accepted
to anywhere, Hamilton.

02:33.975 --> 02:36.076
- I had tried to put
my guilty conscience

02:36.078 --> 02:38.578
about my drunken hookup
with Matty to bed,

02:38.580 --> 02:41.381
but I sensed a wake-up call
was on its way.

02:41.383 --> 02:42.082
- Very cool, Sadie.

02:42.084 --> 02:44.751
Lots to celebrate
on spring break in Rosarito.

02:44.753 --> 02:46.053
Thanks again for including me.

02:46.055 --> 02:46.820
- Of course.

02:46.822 --> 02:48.488
Ignore anything
my slaggy aunt Ally says.

02:48.490 --> 02:49.823
She thinks she's
using all my friends

02:49.825 --> 02:52.993
to mule Mexican pharmaceuticals
across the border.

02:52.995 --> 02:55.896
- Hey, thanks again for all
your help with Matty's party.

02:55.898 --> 02:57.998
By the way, you left
your Tequila at his house.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.733
- Oh, no, I got it.

02:59.735 --> 03:00.667
- You did?
When?

03:00.669 --> 03:02.602
It was definitely still there
after you left.

03:02.604 --> 03:03.670
- I dropped it off to her.

03:03.672 --> 03:04.604
I took it to her on...

03:04.606 --> 03:05.706
- Saturday.
- Sunday.

03:05.708 --> 03:07.574
Sometime over the weekend.
- Yeah.

03:07.576 --> 03:10.677
- Oh, well, thanks again
for bringing it.

03:10.679 --> 03:12.679
I definitely owe you one.

03:12.681 --> 03:13.714
- Oh, hey, Gabby.

03:13.716 --> 03:14.915
Team meeting before class.

03:14.917 --> 03:16.083
- Got to run, see ya.

03:16.085 --> 03:17.784
- Okay, bye.

03:17.786 --> 03:19.519
- Bye.

03:19.521 --> 03:20.687
- I am a horrible person.

03:20.689 --> 03:21.755
- No, you're not.

03:21.757 --> 03:22.622
- What do you know?

03:22.624 --> 03:23.757
You're a horrible person too.

03:23.759 --> 03:24.958
I feel terrible lying to her.

03:24.960 --> 03:27.627
Maybe we should just
tell her about the hookup.

03:27.629 --> 03:28.495
- What?
No.

03:28.497 --> 03:29.429
Why would we do that?

03:29.431 --> 03:30.430
- One thing I have learned

03:30.432 --> 03:31.965
is that secrets always
have a way of coming out.

03:31.967 --> 03:33.967
The important thing
is that we stopped

03:33.969 --> 03:35.135
before it went too far.

03:35.137 --> 03:35.869
- Exactly.

03:35.871 --> 03:39.039
It was just a kiss,
not a big deal.

03:39.041 --> 03:41.708
- Boys, wait up.

03:41.710 --> 03:42.576
I need something.

03:42.578 --> 03:45.712
- Aw, princess,
keep up the sweet talk.

03:45.714 --> 03:47.447
- Your wish is your demand.

03:47.449 --> 03:48.682
- Listen,
I can't afford Columbia,

03:48.684 --> 03:51.118
and I'm not going into debt
for the next 40 years.

03:51.120 --> 03:54.054
- Is that a whiff
of desperation I smell?

03:54.056 --> 03:56.189
- Mmm, desperation
mixed with bitchery

03:56.191 --> 03:58.859
is such an intoxicating
cocktail.

03:58.861 --> 03:59.860
- Good, so drink it up.

03:59.862 --> 04:02.195
I'm a finalist for
the Elsa Hax scholarship,

04:02.197 --> 04:03.864
which will give me
a free ride at Columbia.

04:03.866 --> 04:06.800
They want a one-minute video
showing who I really am,

04:06.802 --> 04:07.801
so I need your expert skills

04:07.803 --> 04:10.837
to make me look like the kind
of sad, simpering sycophant

04:10.839 --> 04:12.205
they love to throw money at.

04:12.207 --> 04:15.208
- That really will
require expertise.

04:15.210 --> 04:16.109
- And possibly CGI.

04:16.111 --> 04:18.812
- Great,
I'll send you the deets.

04:19.881 --> 04:22.749
Jake, I'm shooting
my scholarship video

04:22.751 --> 04:23.717
with Theo and Cole later,

04:23.719 --> 04:25.886
and I want you there too.
- Sure.

04:25.888 --> 04:27.087
I learned a lot
about production

04:27.089 --> 04:27.954
making my music videos.

04:27.956 --> 04:29.523
- Oh, no, I don't need you
for any of that.

04:29.525 --> 04:31.525
Please, those music videos
were pathetic.

04:31.527 --> 04:32.659
I need an image consultant.

04:32.661 --> 04:34.728
I want to come off
as sweet and sincere,

04:34.730 --> 04:36.496
and you're like
vanilla ice cream:

04:36.498 --> 04:37.531
Boring, but everyone likes it,

04:37.533 --> 04:39.966
'cause it's bland, benign,
milquetoast--

04:39.968 --> 04:40.801
- I get it.

04:40.803 --> 04:41.935
- So will you help me?

04:41.937 --> 04:44.104
Pretty please?

04:45.540 --> 04:46.239
[Knocking]

04:46.241 --> 04:51.111
[Hellogoodbye's <i>Die Young, Die</i>
<i>Dumb; Not Soon</i> playing]

04:51.113 --> 04:52.612
- Hi.

04:52.614 --> 04:54.047
- What are you doing here?

04:54.049 --> 04:54.948
You have a girlfriend.

04:54.950 --> 04:57.984
- Yeah, I tried calling
my biological dad.

04:57.986 --> 04:58.852
His number was old.

04:58.854 --> 04:59.920
I guess that's no surprise.

04:59.922 --> 05:01.588
Like he'd have the same number
for 18 years.

05:01.590 --> 05:04.658
- Well, maybe there's someplace
you can get updated info.

05:04.660 --> 05:05.692
Have you tried looking online?

05:05.694 --> 05:09.663
- No, there's gotta be
a million Daniel Durands.

05:09.665 --> 05:11.698
- A million or...

05:11.700 --> 05:13.700
136.

05:13.702 --> 05:14.134
- Jenna?

05:14.136 --> 05:17.204
Oh, hey, Matty, I didn't know
you were here.

05:17.206 --> 05:19.272
Your girlfriend's name
is Gabby, right?

05:19.274 --> 05:21.741
- Jeez, mom,
what are you, TMZ?

05:21.743 --> 05:24.211
- Well, she's at the front door.

05:31.185 --> 05:31.885
- Hey.

05:31.887 --> 05:32.819
I wanted to replace this

05:32.821 --> 05:35.255
since Matty
totaled your other one.

05:35.257 --> 05:36.156
- That is so sweet.

05:36.158 --> 05:37.858
You didn't have to do this.

05:37.860 --> 05:38.758
She really didn't,

05:38.760 --> 05:40.260
because I felt guilty enough.

05:40.262 --> 05:40.994
- I have to say,

05:40.996 --> 05:43.130
I had doubts
about this spring break trip.

05:43.132 --> 05:45.565
I know Sadie and Matty
go way back,

05:45.567 --> 05:47.601
but she kind of scares me.

05:47.603 --> 05:49.002
We went to pre-school together,

05:49.004 --> 05:50.036
and my main memory of her

05:50.038 --> 05:53.306
was of burning insects
with a magnifying glass.

05:53.308 --> 05:55.609
- Oh, she can still
do that trick...

05:55.611 --> 05:56.910
With her eyes.
- [Laughs]

05:56.912 --> 05:58.245
Well, that's why I was so glad
to hear

05:58.247 --> 05:59.579
you're going
on the trip too.

05:59.581 --> 06:02.649
It'll be nice
to have a real friend there.

06:02.651 --> 06:04.284
- That's me.

06:04.286 --> 06:07.287
Your real horrible friend.

06:09.991 --> 06:10.924
- You got to go.

06:10.926 --> 06:11.925
- Why?
Is she coming?

06:11.927 --> 06:13.093
- No, she left,
but you got to go.

06:13.095 --> 06:14.728
- Relax, she doesn't
know I'm here.

06:14.730 --> 06:18.031
We still have time
to search a little bit more.

06:18.033 --> 06:18.932
- I can't do this.

06:18.934 --> 06:20.033
I can't stand sneaking around.

06:20.035 --> 06:22.235
Maybe you should be doing this
with Gabby instead of me.

06:22.237 --> 06:24.037
- Jeez, relax.
Why do you have to make

06:24.039 --> 06:25.539
such a big deal
out of everything?

06:25.541 --> 06:27.574
- If this comes out
the wrong way

06:27.576 --> 06:28.775
or over spring break,

06:28.777 --> 06:29.776
it will be a big deal.

06:29.778 --> 06:31.511
Promise me you'll talk to her.

06:31.513 --> 06:34.247
- Okay, yeah, whatever.

06:36.217 --> 06:37.851
- "I ended up
living with my aunt,

06:37.853 --> 06:41.488
who is battling a chronic
and debilitating illness"?

06:41.490 --> 06:42.489
What's wrong with Ally?

06:42.491 --> 06:43.690
Sounds like she's dying.

06:43.692 --> 06:44.257
- Her liver is.

06:44.259 --> 06:45.926
She's a drunken slut.

06:45.928 --> 06:47.093
- You should just say that.

06:47.095 --> 06:47.928
Speak your truth.

06:47.930 --> 06:49.930
- No, she's trying
to win this thing.

06:49.932 --> 06:50.931
- If this were about being real,

06:50.933 --> 06:52.199
I'd tell these
scholarship people

06:52.201 --> 06:54.801
how [Bleep] lucky
they'd be to get me.

06:54.803 --> 06:57.971
But the Elsa Hax
scholarship committee

06:57.973 --> 06:59.940
wants an ambassador
of suckiness,

06:59.942 --> 07:01.608
so I'm gonna have to act it.

07:01.610 --> 07:04.611
- Ah, the basic
bait-and-bitch switch.

07:04.613 --> 07:05.579
- Exactly.

07:05.581 --> 07:06.146
So are we ready?

07:06.148 --> 07:08.548
Let's get this [Bleep] rolling.

07:08.550 --> 07:09.916
- Action.

07:09.918 --> 07:12.652
- After my own
financial reversal

07:12.654 --> 07:15.222
I came to see
Palos Hills High School

07:15.224 --> 07:19.793
as a gilded cage
of complacency and entitlement.

07:19.795 --> 07:22.963
Unexpectedly, it was working
on the food truck that--

07:22.965 --> 07:25.765
- try not to say "food truck"
like you're constipated.

07:25.767 --> 07:27.133
- How else am I supposed
to say a word

07:27.135 --> 07:31.738
that makes me think
of vile, stanky sausage?

07:33.241 --> 07:36.176
Unexpectedly,
it was working with people

07:36.178 --> 07:39.246
from different
socio-economic backgrounds

07:39.248 --> 07:41.748
that made me feel
connected to everyone,

07:41.750 --> 07:46.086
not just those lucky enough
to be born affluent.

07:46.088 --> 07:51.224
This dual imperative
of social justice and humility

07:51.226 --> 07:54.694
is what I hope
will both buttress and inform

07:54.696 --> 07:56.863
my studies at Columbia.

07:56.865 --> 07:57.631
Did we get it?

07:57.633 --> 07:59.299
Because if I have to smile
for one more minute,

07:59.301 --> 08:00.634
I am going to puke.

08:00.636 --> 08:02.135
- Yeah, I think so.

08:02.137 --> 08:04.571
- How long will this take
to cut together?

08:04.573 --> 08:06.006
- It'll require painstaking work

08:06.008 --> 08:09.042
to knit together 60 seconds
wiped of all bitchery and shade.

08:09.044 --> 08:12.712
- Great, I won't be needing
your services any longer.

08:12.714 --> 08:16.683
- Come back, Sadie.
- Oh, no, my dreams are ruined.

08:16.685 --> 08:17.684
- I want you to edit it.

08:17.686 --> 08:18.618
- Me?
What--why?

08:18.620 --> 08:21.021
- Because I got what I needed
from those twisted twinks,

08:21.023 --> 08:23.623
and now I need a nice guy
to do as he's told.

08:23.625 --> 08:25.358
So don't [Bleep] it up, okay?

08:25.360 --> 08:27.160
Oh...

08:27.162 --> 08:30.764
And thank you so much, Jake.

08:32.199 --> 08:34.100
- I had survived
last night's close encounter

08:34.102 --> 08:36.169
and was determined
to be a better friend to Gabby

08:36.171 --> 08:39.072
by limiting future
encounters with Matty.

08:39.074 --> 08:40.173
- Jen.

08:40.175 --> 08:42.309
Matty told me what went down
after his party,

08:42.311 --> 08:43.843
and I totally understand.

08:43.845 --> 08:44.644
Don't worry.

08:44.646 --> 08:46.246
We never even have
to speak about it.

08:46.248 --> 08:47.113
- Oh, thank God.

08:47.115 --> 08:48.081
I knew you'd understand.

08:48.083 --> 08:50.083
I mean, we didn't mean
for anything to happen.

08:50.085 --> 08:54.321
We were just both
really drunk and sad, and--

08:54.323 --> 08:54.954
- hey.

08:54.956 --> 08:57.824
- Did you hook up with Jenna?

08:57.826 --> 08:59.759
- I thought you told her.
She said--

08:59.761 --> 09:01.094
- he told me you've been
talking a lot

09:01.096 --> 09:03.830
because you're upset
your mom got into college.

09:03.832 --> 09:05.131
- That is true, too.

09:05.133 --> 09:07.000
- I am such an idiot.

09:07.002 --> 09:10.136
You two have fun
on spring break together.

09:10.138 --> 09:13.940
- No, Gabby, wait, it's--

09:13.942 --> 09:16.843
thanks, Jenna.

09:16.845 --> 09:18.411
Gabby.

09:20.781 --> 09:22.082
- Let's eat inside today.

09:22.084 --> 09:24.884
There's too much trash out here.

09:24.886 --> 09:26.353
- What's with
intimidation nation?

09:26.355 --> 09:29.723
I thought you were tight
with "Gab" and her crew.

09:29.725 --> 09:30.423
- Things have changed.

09:30.425 --> 09:31.891
- Oh, my God,
what have you done now?

09:31.893 --> 09:33.226
- Why do you just assume
it's my fault?

09:33.228 --> 09:36.196
- Because I've known you
my whole life.

09:36.198 --> 09:38.865
- Matty and I sort of hooked up,

09:38.867 --> 09:41.201
briefly and barely,
after his birthday party.

09:41.203 --> 09:43.002
- How could you be
so deja-stupid?

09:43.004 --> 09:43.970
When are you gonna learn?

09:43.972 --> 09:45.939
Old boyfriends are like chips:
No double-dipping.

09:45.941 --> 09:48.341
- It's not like that.
It was a really intense night.

09:48.343 --> 09:51.177
I'd just found out
that my mom got into lockard,

09:51.179 --> 09:53.747
and Matty...

09:53.749 --> 09:54.848
- Really?
More secrets?

09:54.850 --> 09:56.416
It's not my secret,
it's Matty's.

09:56.418 --> 09:58.752
- Okay, I know I can't
keep a secret,

09:58.754 --> 10:01.321
but you still--later.

10:15.870 --> 10:18.805
- I decided to finish my lunch
in a familiar place

10:18.807 --> 10:21.975
without the judgmental stares.

10:27.148 --> 10:31.851
Unfortunately, judgment was
hard to outrun in high school.

10:31.853 --> 10:34.120
Honesty had proved
a dangerous policy,

10:34.122 --> 10:35.955
and I was suffering
the consequences

10:35.957 --> 10:36.823
from Gabby and her crew.

10:36.825 --> 10:41.227
Luckily, I had a guidance
counselor available 24/7.

10:41.229 --> 10:42.395
[Laughter]

10:42.397 --> 10:45.265
- [Muffled]
Spring break, woot-woot!

10:45.267 --> 10:46.032
Did you hear?

10:46.034 --> 10:47.967
Will and I are going to be
meeting you in Mexico.

10:47.969 --> 10:49.769
- Yeah, I'm teaching Val
how to scuba dive.

10:49.771 --> 10:51.137
I can't believe
she's never gone down

10:51.139 --> 10:54.040
and explored all the life
just teeming in the ocean.

10:54.042 --> 10:54.908
- Well, what can I say?

10:54.910 --> 10:58.211
I never wanted to go down
until I met you.

10:58.213 --> 10:58.812
Huh?

10:58.814 --> 11:01.247
- Should I give you guys
some private time?

11:01.249 --> 11:02.849
- Yeah, thanks.

11:02.851 --> 11:04.217
- I heard about your hookup.

11:04.219 --> 11:04.918
I get it.

11:04.920 --> 11:07.020
That intimidation nation group
scares me too.

11:07.022 --> 11:07.987
It's understandable.

11:07.989 --> 11:09.989
The only way you felt
you could compete

11:09.991 --> 11:10.890
was by slutting it up.

11:10.892 --> 11:12.859
- It wasn't about that.
I was sad.

11:12.861 --> 11:15.829
I just found out
my mom got into college.

11:15.831 --> 11:16.830
- Well, bravo.

11:16.832 --> 11:18.231
She's challenging herself,

11:18.233 --> 11:19.299
exploring uncharted waters.

11:19.301 --> 11:21.167
- Yeah, I understand
Lacey's need to grow.

11:21.169 --> 11:24.938
Will is pushing me to break free
from my normal routine.

11:24.940 --> 11:27.140
Speaking of,
I need to be <i>au courant</i>

11:27.142 --> 11:29.776
on all things sexual
for spring break.

11:29.778 --> 11:32.979
Is it really possible
to fit two whole--

11:32.981 --> 11:34.347
- okay, not engaging.

11:34.349 --> 11:35.181
- Okay, good talk.

11:35.183 --> 11:36.983
Don't be so hard on yourself.

11:36.985 --> 11:38.151
It takes two to tango,

11:38.153 --> 11:39.285
or sometimes three.

11:39.287 --> 11:40.253
It's not all your fault.

11:40.255 --> 11:41.254
- It's all your fault.

11:41.256 --> 11:44.224
Thanks to you, Matty isn't
going on spring break.

11:44.226 --> 11:45.258
- What?
I thought it was

11:45.260 --> 11:46.793
just Gabby
who wasn't going.

11:46.795 --> 11:47.894
- Matty is one of the few people

11:47.896 --> 11:49.429
I actually care about
in this school.

11:49.431 --> 11:51.364
And now he's not going
because of you

11:51.366 --> 11:55.368
and your overeager,
rasty little beaver.

11:59.874 --> 12:01.207
- Next up, a video essay
submitted to us

12:01.209 --> 12:02.709
this very morning
by Sadie Saxton,

12:02.711 --> 12:04.377
who's a finalist
for the Elsa Hax scholarship,

12:04.379 --> 12:06.913
which she hopes will pay her way
to Columbia University.

12:06.915 --> 12:10.049
Take note, all you juniors.
This is the kind of sucking up

12:10.051 --> 12:13.419
that gets you a free ride
to the Ivy League.

12:13.421 --> 12:15.154
- My name is Sadie Saxton,

12:15.156 --> 12:19.225
and I'm a senior here
at Palos Hills--[Bleep].

12:19.227 --> 12:20.126
Can we do it again?

12:20.128 --> 12:22.128
I said "Palos" like a cholo.

12:22.130 --> 12:23.162
[Laughter]

12:23.164 --> 12:24.831
I've embraced my experiences

12:24.833 --> 12:26.432
beyond the gilded [Bleep]--
cages.

12:26.434 --> 12:28.334
[Bleep], I have to
do that again.

12:28.336 --> 12:29.369
[Laughter]

12:29.371 --> 12:30.837
Can you stop whispering?

12:30.839 --> 12:33.373
Stop whispering,
Mary-Kate and Trashley.

12:33.375 --> 12:34.307
Shut the [Bleep] up.

12:34.309 --> 12:36.910
Shut the [Bleep] up
or get out.

12:36.912 --> 12:38.811
[Laughter]

12:38.813 --> 12:39.913
If you ask for one more take,

12:39.915 --> 12:42.348
I will smash this camera
into your brain.

12:42.350 --> 12:44.717
[Laughter]
Give that back to me--[Grunts]!

12:44.719 --> 12:47.854
[Bleep] [Bleep]
Get it together, [Bleep].

12:47.856 --> 12:51.891
Shut the [Bleep] up!
[Laughter]

12:52.826 --> 12:56.829
I am going to flay
and murder you...

12:56.831 --> 12:58.131
Very slowly.

12:58.133 --> 12:59.265
- That sounds hot.

12:59.267 --> 13:01.768
But, sadly, can't take credit.

13:01.770 --> 13:02.402
Jake is your man.

13:02.404 --> 13:06.940
Someone spiked that vanilla
shake with a little rum.

13:08.108 --> 13:09.809
- Rosati!

13:09.811 --> 13:10.843
What the hell, Rosati?

13:10.845 --> 13:12.111
That is not the video
you showed me.

13:12.113 --> 13:14.881
That better not be the video
that went to Columbia.

13:14.883 --> 13:15.815
- Aw, you don't like it?

13:15.817 --> 13:17.884
I thought the point
was to capture the real you.

13:17.886 --> 13:19.185
- This is not a joke, you ass.

13:19.187 --> 13:20.486
- How about instead
of the word "ass,"

13:20.488 --> 13:22.789
you substitute
"one of my oldest friends,

13:22.791 --> 13:25.024
who's always had my back."

13:25.026 --> 13:26.426
- You didn't send it.

13:26.428 --> 13:28.294
I knew you it.
You are too--

13:28.296 --> 13:28.895
- nice?

13:28.897 --> 13:30.930
Here's the thing.
We're all used to you.

13:30.932 --> 13:32.532
You exhale so much snark
on a daily basis,

13:32.534 --> 13:35.268
you might actually be
what's killing the bees.

13:35.270 --> 13:36.402
- I'm getting bored.

13:36.404 --> 13:39.806
- At Columbia,
no one knows you yet.

13:39.808 --> 13:41.541
You get a clean slate.

13:41.543 --> 13:42.809
- Oh, I get it.

13:42.811 --> 13:46.145
You're trying
to teach me a lesson.

13:46.147 --> 13:47.046
Precious.

13:47.048 --> 13:48.114
Really, I'm touched.

13:48.116 --> 13:48.982
Let me think about this,

13:48.984 --> 13:50.984
'cause maybe it'll convince me
to change my ways

13:50.986 --> 13:53.386
and go off to college
as a super nice girl.

13:53.388 --> 13:55.555
- No, you'll never be that,
Sadie.

13:55.557 --> 13:57.457
But maybe you're not
as big a bitch

13:57.459 --> 14:00.493
as you want everyone
to think you are.

14:03.797 --> 14:07.066
- No, I totally am.

14:07.068 --> 14:08.034
- Matty, wait.

14:08.036 --> 14:08.901
Look, we made a mistake.

14:08.903 --> 14:10.236
- Yeah, I know,
we should have told her.

14:10.238 --> 14:11.237
Things have a way of coming out.

14:11.239 --> 14:13.239
- You have to communicate
with her, Matty.

14:13.241 --> 14:14.240
- Yeah, I'm trying.

14:14.242 --> 14:15.274
It's not that easy.

14:15.276 --> 14:16.542
- Well, you're able to with me,

14:16.544 --> 14:17.410
in your own sort of way.

14:17.412 --> 14:19.846
- Yeah, well,
it's easier with you.

14:19.848 --> 14:20.580
- Well, I'm not the one

14:20.582 --> 14:22.215
you're trying to have
a relationship with.

14:22.217 --> 14:25.118
Look, we have a habit
of falling into old patterns,

14:25.120 --> 14:27.854
and it keeps screwing us up.
- Yeah, I know.

14:27.856 --> 14:29.022
- And now
the spring break thing.

14:29.024 --> 14:30.823
- Well, I'm not going,
so it won't be a problem.

14:30.825 --> 14:32.492
- But you should go.
We should both be able to go.

14:32.494 --> 14:33.493
It's our last spring break.

14:33.495 --> 14:35.161
- It would end my relationship
with Gabby.

14:35.163 --> 14:37.030
- Because you haven't
told her the truth.

14:37.032 --> 14:38.431
Why don't you just tell her
about the letter

14:38.433 --> 14:40.133
and that you're trying
to find your real dad?

14:40.135 --> 14:42.068
- Hey, I told you
I'm not ready, okay?

14:42.070 --> 14:43.269
- To share something
with a girl

14:43.271 --> 14:46.039
you're willing
to miss spring break over,

14:46.041 --> 14:48.841
or to find your real dad?

14:48.843 --> 14:50.043
- Both.

14:50.045 --> 14:53.846
- Matty, if you weren't ready,
why did you come to me?

14:53.848 --> 14:55.915
- I have no clue.

14:55.917 --> 14:57.383
I wish I hadn't.

[Mellow rock music]

15:00.622 --> 15:02.121
♪

15:02.123 --> 15:03.923
- Matty was impossible
to decipher,

15:03.925 --> 15:05.224
so why did I keep
trying to help him?

15:05.226 --> 15:07.293
Shouldn't he have been going
to his girlfriend for that?

15:07.295 --> 15:10.863
Oh, right, he wasn't ready
to communicate with her yet.

15:10.865 --> 15:11.531
He had me for that.

15:11.533 --> 15:14.167
- Hey, let's go bikini shopping
for spring break.

15:14.169 --> 15:17.570
- I don't even want
to go on spring break anymore.

15:17.572 --> 15:19.205
- Is this about me
going to college?

15:19.207 --> 15:20.606
- No, it's not about you.

15:20.608 --> 15:22.275
Not everything is about you.

15:22.277 --> 15:23.409
- Hey, I don't like your tone.

15:23.411 --> 15:26.546
Whether I go to college or not,
I am still your mother.

15:26.548 --> 15:28.648
- Oh, I'm sorry
if I get confused

15:28.650 --> 15:30.416
on when to treat you
like a mother.

15:30.418 --> 15:31.250
The way I see it,

- I had one shot...

15:37.425 --> 15:38.424
And an orange juice chaser.

15:38.426 --> 15:40.460
- It's like you're
competing with me.

15:40.462 --> 15:42.228
I mean, you have
a better body than me.

15:42.230 --> 15:43.896
You're more fun at parties
than me.

15:43.898 --> 15:44.530
You dress better.

15:44.532 --> 15:46.499

to take you shopping.

how humiliating it is

15:48.236 --> 15:51.204
that you got into college
and I didn't.

Congratulations, mom.

I am too old for college.

16:00.682 --> 16:03.249
It is too late
for me to start over.

16:03.251 --> 16:05.551
- Mom, wait.

16:05.553 --> 16:08.354
I don't want her to not go
because of me.

16:08.356 --> 16:09.188
- She's going.

16:09.190 --> 16:10.456
I already mailed
her tuition check.

16:10.458 --> 16:13.059
- Well, cancel it.
She doesn't want to go.

16:13.061 --> 16:15.128
- Yeah, that's what she said.

16:15.130 --> 16:17.296
But look at all that she did.

16:17.298 --> 16:18.297
Took the S.A.T.s,

16:18.299 --> 16:21.033
filled out applications,
write essays,

16:21.035 --> 16:23.503
all knowing that she
could be rejected.

16:23.505 --> 16:25.972
- Trust me, I know
all about rejection.

16:25.974 --> 16:26.472
I got two.

16:26.474 --> 16:28.941
- Jenna, you will
get into college,

16:28.943 --> 16:30.710
and into the right place
for you.

16:30.712 --> 16:32.445
- How can you be so sure?

16:32.447 --> 16:34.580
- Because I believe in you,

16:34.582 --> 16:36.282
like I believe in your mom.

16:36.284 --> 16:38.317
And I know her
better than anyone.

16:38.319 --> 16:39.585
She wants this.

16:39.587 --> 16:40.520
She's just scared.

16:40.522 --> 16:42.288
She needs me to give her
a little push

16:42.290 --> 16:43.189
to get over the hump.

16:43.191 --> 16:44.590
That's what you do
for the people you love.

16:44.592 --> 16:48.161
- My father's unscrambling
of my mother's mixed signals

16:48.163 --> 16:49.662
got me thinking about Matty.

16:49.664 --> 16:51.664
Can I ask you a question?
- Hmm?

16:51.666 --> 16:56.135
- Why is it so hard
to be friends with exes?

16:56.137 --> 16:57.136
- I don't know.

16:57.138 --> 17:00.239
I guess it's confusing for guys.

17:00.241 --> 17:02.241
Our heads are wired one way,

17:02.243 --> 17:05.278
and our hearts
are wired another,

17:05.280 --> 17:07.647
and our--

17:07.649 --> 17:08.414
we shut down.

17:08.416 --> 17:10.716
And we don't communicate
what we really want.

17:10.718 --> 17:11.751
Now, if you'll excuse me,

17:11.753 --> 17:15.288
I've got to go tell your mother
that she's going to college

17:15.290 --> 17:18.291
or she's grounded.

17:18.293 --> 17:20.059
- Suddenly,
it made perfect sense

17:20.061 --> 17:21.427
why Matty had turned
to me for help

17:21.429 --> 17:23.729
finding his bio dad
instead of Gabby.

17:23.731 --> 17:25.565
He was scared
and needed a little push

17:25.567 --> 17:29.368
from the person who knew him
better than anyone.

17:30.204 --> 17:33.439
There was more than one fixer
in this family.

17:37.077 --> 17:38.144
- Your mom let me in.

17:38.146 --> 17:42.582
I found your biological father.

17:42.584 --> 17:44.617
- Okay.

17:45.652 --> 17:48.087
- Turns out that
eight of the Daniels

17:48.089 --> 17:48.955
were actually Danielles.

17:48.957 --> 17:50.523
So then I narrowed it down
by race and age,

17:50.525 --> 17:52.959
took a gamble that he still
lived on the west coast

17:52.961 --> 17:53.726
and wasn't incarcerated,

17:53.728 --> 17:58.197
and narrowed it down to three
very real possibilities.

17:58.199 --> 17:59.599
And they're all on Facebook.

17:59.601 --> 18:03.402
So the first one
is Professor Durand.

18:03.404 --> 18:05.638
Ph.D. At Oregon.

18:05.640 --> 18:06.405
Smart gene pool.

18:06.407 --> 18:09.175
Second is Danny D.
From Bakersfield,

18:09.177 --> 18:11.510
although I can't really
picture your father

18:11.512 --> 18:13.346
having a unibrow.

18:13.348 --> 18:15.281
And then there's this guy.

18:15.283 --> 18:16.315
He owns a beach rentals place

18:16.317 --> 18:18.284
and is also
a paddle board instructor.

18:18.286 --> 18:20.486
And get this, his place
is right next to the border.

18:20.488 --> 18:23.222
It's, like, an hour
from Ally's beach house.

18:23.224 --> 18:25.591
Maybe you're meant
to go on spring break.

18:25.593 --> 18:27.426
Maybe it's destiny.

18:27.428 --> 18:29.528
- I did not ask you to do this.

18:29.530 --> 18:30.229
- I know.

18:30.231 --> 18:32.131
Now that you have
the information,

18:32.133 --> 18:36.469
you can decide what you want
to do with it when you're ready.

18:43.243 --> 18:44.076
What's that?

18:44.078 --> 18:45.678
- It's your mother's
personal statement

18:45.680 --> 18:46.545
for her college app.

18:46.547 --> 18:49.782
- Let me guess, her dreams
of fixing the world?

18:49.784 --> 18:52.118
- Sort of.

18:58.392 --> 19:00.192
- "Some people want
to go to college

19:00.194 --> 19:02.194
"so they can change the world.

19:02.196 --> 19:03.329
"I just want to change me.

19:03.331 --> 19:06.098
"There are a lot of things
I would have done differently

19:06.100 --> 19:07.733
"in my life if I had the chance.

19:07.735 --> 19:11.137
"Most people would say
that my daughter was a mistake.

19:11.139 --> 19:13.673
"No one actually intends
to get pregnant at 16.

19:13.675 --> 19:15.374
"But that's not
the way I see it.

19:15.376 --> 19:19.345
"My daughter definitely altered
the trajectory of my life.

19:19.347 --> 19:20.780
"I have never regretted it.

19:20.782 --> 19:23.549
"I considered it a privilege
to care for her

19:23.551 --> 19:24.617
"and, yes, to be honest,

19:24.619 --> 19:26.419
"to oftentimes grow up with her.

19:26.421 --> 19:31.490
"Hell, maybe she grew up
faster than I did.

19:31.492 --> 19:33.392
"She is so smart
and so mature

19:33.394 --> 19:35.361
"that sometimes
she intimidates me,

19:35.363 --> 19:37.830
"but more often,
she inspires me.

19:37.832 --> 19:39.065
"Maybe that's my real goal

19:39.067 --> 19:40.633
" when in trying to get
into college,

19:40.635 --> 19:43.302
"to make my daughter
as proud of me

19:43.304 --> 19:44.303
"as I am of her,

19:44.305 --> 19:48.841
to live up to being
Jenna Hamilton's mother."

19:50.777 --> 19:52.278
- Does that mean
you're okay with col--

19:52.280 --> 19:55.514
- no, but at some point
I will be.

19:55.516 --> 19:56.515
- Okay, got it.

19:56.517 --> 19:57.416
- And I knew I would.

19:57.418 --> 20:00.553
I was surprising myself
with my resilience...

20:00.555 --> 20:01.287
And my optimism.

20:01.289 --> 20:04.457
I even had a feeling things
were gonna work out with Matty.

20:04.459 --> 20:07.760
- Hey, I just wanted
to let you know

20:07.762 --> 20:12.832
that I made contact
with my biological dad.

20:12.834 --> 20:18.437
And I think I'm gonna
meet him on spring break.

20:18.439 --> 20:24.243
I'm sorry if I've been acting
like a real jerk.

20:24.245 --> 20:26.612
The truth is, I...

20:26.614 --> 20:28.814
Am a little scared
to meet this guy.

20:28.816 --> 20:32.718
I'd really like
for you to be there with me.

20:35.822 --> 20:36.489
- Next, on <i>Awkward...</i>

20:36.491 --> 20:37.857
- We're on spring break, people!

20:37.859 --> 20:39.125
- This is our last spring break
together.

20:39.127 --> 20:40.226
So let's really max it out.

20:40.228 --> 20:42.828
- We brought the best party
favor ever.

20:42.830 --> 20:43.896
Both: We're big in Japan!

20:43.898 --> 20:45.531
- Our video has like
12 million hits.

20:45.533 --> 20:48.401
- Goodbye, Palos Hills.
Hello, New York City.

20:48.403 --> 20:50.970
Pretty soon it will all have
been just a bad dream.

20:50.972 --> 20:52.204
- I should have known,
once again,

20:52.206 --> 20:55.041
I was going to be left out
in the cold.
