00:33.399 --> 00:37.245
- I don't know if I wanna do this.
- Relax, Laine, it's fun.

00:38.271 --> 00:40.012
First, the rules.

00:40.240 --> 00:43.119
You can never, ever play alone.

00:43.276 --> 00:47.947
You can never play in a graveyard.
And you always have to say goodbye.

00:48.114 --> 00:52.529
To start, you circle the board
once for each player.

00:52.919 --> 00:56.796
Then we say, "As friends we gather,
hearts are true."

00:57.123 --> 00:59.535
"As friends we gather, hearts are true."

00:59.692 --> 01:01.895
"Spirits near, we call to you."

01:01.995 --> 01:04.241
"Spirits near, we call to you."

01:04.364 --> 01:07.010
Is someone here with us?

01:13.706 --> 01:15.379
Debbie, cut it out!

01:15.942 --> 01:20.518
If a ghost is here, you can see them
through the planchette.

01:20.813 --> 01:24.758
It's the eye to the other side.

01:27.854 --> 01:31.826
If someone is here with us,
make yourself known.

01:45.238 --> 01:46.615
What are you guys doing?

01:46.906 --> 01:48.610
Get out of here, Sarah!

01:50.810 --> 01:54.047
Calm down. It's only a game.

02:30.516 --> 02:31.927
Goodbye.

03:05.385 --> 03:08.125
- Laine, hey.
- Deb. Where are you?

03:09.088 --> 03:11.728
I'm here. I've been here.

03:12.892 --> 03:15.736
It's just been a little rough this week.

03:16.462 --> 03:19.999
You've gotta tell me what's been going on.
And don't think you're bailing on me again.

03:20.099 --> 03:23.113
- We're gonna be late for the game.
- Oh, yeah.

03:23.770 --> 03:26.105
You know, I don't think I'm coming.

03:26.205 --> 03:29.211
Oh, well. I'm not leaving
until I get to talk to you.

03:30.943 --> 03:31.744
Fine.

03:32.578 --> 03:34.785
I'll be right out, just give me a sec.

03:52.365 --> 03:54.010
What's going on?

03:55.034 --> 03:57.036
- Are you sick?
- No.

03:57.136 --> 03:59.439
- Did you and Pete have a fight?
- No, nothing like that.

03:59.539 --> 04:01.140
Then what is it?

04:01.440 --> 04:03.514
- Nothing.
- Debbie, tell me.

04:04.344 --> 04:05.550
I just don't wanna go out tonight.

04:06.779 --> 04:08.622
No secrets between us, remember?

04:10.850 --> 04:14.020
Remember that game we used to play,
where you ask questions about the future?

04:14.120 --> 04:16.591
- The Ouija board.
- Yeah.

04:17.357 --> 04:20.892
A couple of weeks ago, I played it.

04:20.993 --> 04:24.133
Just messing around and...

04:28.634 --> 04:30.636
I don't know. I don't know.

04:33.906 --> 04:35.112
That is just a game.

04:35.408 --> 04:37.183
You know you've always
been like this, right?

04:37.543 --> 04:40.113
- Like what?
- Just a total and complete spaz.

04:43.850 --> 04:45.051
You're right, I'm being crazy.

04:45.151 --> 04:48.320
Look, I don't even have to go to the
basketball game. We always lose.

04:48.420 --> 04:50.189
- I'm just gonna come in with you...
- No, don't.

04:51.824 --> 04:54.632
I mean, my folks are gonna
be home any minute,

04:54.894 --> 04:58.531
and I'm just being dramatic,
and everything is fine.

04:58.631 --> 05:00.110
Are you sure you don't wanna come?

05:00.600 --> 05:03.503
I have leftovers inside,
I'm gonna rock it out,

05:03.603 --> 05:05.405
but I will see you in the morning,
that's for sure.

05:05.505 --> 05:07.573
Okay. Do you want me to order for you?

05:07.673 --> 05:09.142
Pancakes with the works?

05:09.242 --> 05:10.414
Okay.

05:10.777 --> 05:13.887
- I miss you.
- I miss you already.

08:04.517 --> 08:05.518
No.

09:37.143 --> 09:40.753
Laine, hey. Sorry I'm late.
I have a surprise for you.

09:41.781 --> 09:43.192
Check this out.

09:43.449 --> 09:44.884
Oh, you have a map.

09:44.984 --> 09:46.853
Yep. This is the place
I was telling you about.

09:46.953 --> 09:48.921
It's up the coast, away from everyone.

09:49.021 --> 09:50.790
- We can make camp right about here.
- Yeah.

09:50.890 --> 09:52.801
Hike down to the beach anytime we want.

09:53.192 --> 09:54.527
It's the first time
I'm hearing it as "we."

09:54.627 --> 09:56.368
I want you to come with.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.632
But I thought this was your
big camping trip with the guys.

09:59.732 --> 10:03.336
I know, but I started thinking about it
and I realized I'd miss you too much.

10:04.804 --> 10:06.719
Okay, so you're surfing all day.
What do I do?

10:06.819 --> 10:09.208
I'm gonna teach you. By the end of
the week, you'll be one with the waves.

10:09.308 --> 10:10.616
- It's gonna be awesome.
- Oh, my God, no.

10:10.810 --> 10:12.044
I promise. Come on.

10:12.144 --> 10:14.488
You can forget about the world
for a while, leave it all behind.

10:15.314 --> 10:16.849
I can't wait to see you
run this past my dad.

10:16.949 --> 10:20.819
I got that covered, too. Tell him
it's the senior trip. Fully chaperoned.

10:21.253 --> 10:23.155
- Good luck with that.
- What? I can be persuasive.

10:23.255 --> 10:24.557
- Really?
- Yeah. I've been told this.

10:24.657 --> 10:27.729
- By who?
- You. Every day.

10:28.327 --> 10:30.568
Okay, very cute. Break it up, you two.

10:30.996 --> 10:32.365
- Hello.
- Hey.

10:32.465 --> 10:33.866
Hey, Iz. Little more bean juice.

10:37.937 --> 10:39.271
Where's Debbie?

10:39.371 --> 10:41.182
Oh, I think she's running late.

10:41.874 --> 10:45.283
So, what time are we hitting
that party tonight?

10:45.544 --> 10:47.986
- I think we're passing.
- Yeah. We might watch a movie or something.

10:48.247 --> 10:50.816
- No, come on, you guys can't.
- Yeah.

10:50.916 --> 10:52.520
Laine's making you bail on me.

10:52.752 --> 10:55.298
You're a big girl, Iz.
There's nothing wrong with flying solo.

10:55.621 --> 10:58.424
Yeah, me showing up alone,
that's not really a good look for me.

10:59.625 --> 11:02.461
- Not everybody has, you know, this.
- What's this?

11:02.561 --> 11:04.730
Your perfect couple situation.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.132
Look at her acting like
she's not the one

11:06.232 --> 11:08.000
who breaks up with every guy
she goes out with.

11:08.100 --> 11:11.137
- I can't help it, I'm a picky bitch.
- God!

11:17.309 --> 11:18.413
What's up?

11:19.979 --> 11:21.083
I gotta go. It's my dad.

11:21.914 --> 11:23.257
Let me guess, your sister?

11:23.415 --> 11:26.791
Yep. Causing chaos wherever she goes.
I'm sorry, guys. Come on.

11:39.431 --> 11:41.634
- What's going on?
- I'm so sorry.

11:41.734 --> 11:44.837
Nona wanted to be here for you.
Laine, sit down. We need to talk.

11:44.937 --> 11:46.672
I don't wanna sit down.
Just tell me what's going on.

11:46.772 --> 11:48.040
Laine, sit down.

11:48.140 --> 11:49.975
I don't wanna sit down!
Someone tell me what's going on!

11:50.075 --> 11:51.213
It's about Debbie.

12:28.214 --> 12:29.348
Nona, can I talk to you?

12:33.719 --> 12:34.959
I don't think I can go in.

12:35.120 --> 12:37.758
This doesn't seem real.
She should still be here.

12:38.724 --> 12:40.362
She's still here.

12:40.860 --> 12:42.271
She's right here.

12:43.696 --> 12:44.897
Here.

12:51.837 --> 12:53.806
I just don't understand.

12:53.906 --> 12:55.541
None of us can.

12:55.641 --> 12:57.977
She told me that she'd
see us the next morning.

12:58.077 --> 12:59.879
Why would she say
that if she was going to...

12:59.979 --> 13:01.652
We'll never know.

13:04.884 --> 13:08.354
I wish she would have talked to us
about whatever it was.

13:08.454 --> 13:11.094
I know what the police say,
but I can't believe she'd ever...

13:23.435 --> 13:27.139
And that Carol found her like that,
it's just horrible.

13:27.239 --> 13:29.842
They're packed and coming
to stay with me.

13:29.942 --> 13:32.149
Can't be in this house another night.

13:36.282 --> 13:37.522
Pete.

13:37.950 --> 13:39.190
Laine.

13:41.687 --> 13:44.029
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm sorry, too.

13:48.794 --> 13:50.305
I brought flowers.

13:50.963 --> 13:52.331
Debbie liked this kind.

13:52.431 --> 13:55.745
They're really pretty. Do you
want me to put them in some water?

13:56.268 --> 13:58.637
No. I'll find her mom.

13:58.737 --> 14:00.444
I should give them to her.

15:16.715 --> 15:18.351
Laine.

15:21.453 --> 15:23.524
- You were everything to her.
- Mrs. G.

15:26.358 --> 15:28.203
I'm sorry. I just...

15:30.462 --> 15:32.373
I just wanted to be in her room.

15:32.965 --> 15:34.469
It's okay.

15:38.203 --> 15:40.843
The hours you two spent in here.

15:42.341 --> 15:45.754
And by fifth grade,
you'd picked out your college.

15:48.680 --> 15:52.418
She used to draw pictures of...

15:52.518 --> 15:54.930
of what our dorms would look like.

15:55.687 --> 15:57.689
Everything was purple.

15:59.658 --> 16:01.860
Yeah, I remember that.

16:03.162 --> 16:04.300
Her purple phase.

16:05.431 --> 16:07.934
Thank you for watching
the house while we're gone.

16:09.902 --> 16:12.280
I don't know when we'll be back.

16:13.505 --> 16:14.506
Here.

16:17.109 --> 16:18.588
I put these things together for you.

16:20.279 --> 16:21.986
She'd want you to have them.

16:24.016 --> 16:26.018
Always remember her.

16:27.886 --> 16:30.794
No, that's it, that's the one. Look!

16:31.323 --> 16:33.303
Let me see your bootyshake!

16:33.459 --> 16:35.394
See? It's good!

16:35.494 --> 16:38.063
Ladies, I need you to
keep it down in there.

16:38.163 --> 16:39.733
We do have other customers.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.503
We were a lot cooler than
we're making this seem.

16:44.636 --> 16:46.305
Right. Pete says,
"How are you gonna dance?"

16:46.405 --> 16:49.041
- Look at my girls!
- I'm glad I have it now!

16:49.141 --> 16:51.477
- Oh, my God, I need to see you.
- I'm gonna cry!

16:53.512 --> 16:56.815
- Aw, my girls! Look at you!
- Jeez.

16:56.915 --> 16:58.283
- You need to pull that up a little.
- Booty-tooch.

16:58.383 --> 16:59.384
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Oh, my God!

16:59.551 --> 17:01.497
Why are you always pulling up my dress?

17:01.753 --> 17:04.323
Whether or not you have
any sort of affection inside of you

17:04.423 --> 17:06.458
that you want to give to your boyfriend...

17:06.558 --> 17:09.895
- You don't think I have any affection?
- I mean, right now, I don't know.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.002
You're gonna love me for doing that.

17:17.102 --> 17:18.508
Why?

17:54.806 --> 17:56.451
Really, Sarah?

17:57.075 --> 17:59.646
After everything that happened today,
you have to do this?

18:00.078 --> 18:02.481
- Do what?
- Sneak out.

18:02.581 --> 18:04.857
Make things so hard, all the time.

18:05.817 --> 18:09.456
Look, I just wanna get out of here
and forget this shitty day, all right?

18:09.588 --> 18:11.329
Oh, I'm sorry,
but you're not going anywhere.

18:12.457 --> 18:15.428
Mom is not around.
She hasn't been for a while.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.903
And you don't need to be her, okay?

18:18.597 --> 18:21.233
It's not your job to
hover over me all the time.

18:21.333 --> 18:22.673
I wish I didn't have to.

18:22.801 --> 18:26.244
Well, then just don't care so much.
It's way easier.

18:31.477 --> 18:33.178
Okay, Dad, here's your flight confirmation.

18:33.278 --> 18:35.581
Once the permits get approved,
I'll be back.

18:35.681 --> 18:37.816
- It might be a few days, though. Okay?
- Okay.

18:37.916 --> 18:39.818
Nona knows I'm leaving,
so call her if you need anything.

18:39.918 --> 18:42.959
Yeah, I got it covered, Dad.
Don't worry. Bye.

18:43.522 --> 18:44.660
Have a safe trip.

18:46.358 --> 18:47.598
I'll text you when I get there.

19:08.347 --> 19:10.616
We have class in a half hour.
How long is this gonna take?

19:10.716 --> 19:13.452
Mrs. G just wants me to check
a few things. So, two minutes.

19:13.552 --> 19:14.553
Sure.

19:15.654 --> 19:18.166
Oh, and can you go around back
and check the pool cover?

19:18.266 --> 19:19.861
Yeah, I got it.

20:30.395 --> 20:31.601
Hello?

21:55.447 --> 21:56.648
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

21:56.748 --> 22:00.092
- It's me. Are you ready to go?
- I didn't even hear you come up.

22:00.318 --> 22:01.453
What is that?

22:01.553 --> 22:06.161
Just something Debbie and I
used to do ages ago.

22:06.324 --> 22:09.203
- It was a joke, right?
- We pretended it was real.

22:09.361 --> 22:12.397
We asked it questions like,
"Do I have a secret admirer?"

22:12.497 --> 22:14.969
"Will we be friends forever?"
Things like that.

22:15.300 --> 22:18.236
And one of you was just pushing it?

22:18.336 --> 22:20.270
Yes.

22:21.807 --> 22:23.850
I didn't know she had one.

22:25.377 --> 22:27.516
I have so many questions.

22:27.679 --> 22:31.191
If I had just stayed. I was right here.
If I hadn't have left her, you know...

22:31.316 --> 22:32.817
Laine,

22:33.852 --> 22:34.820
it's not your fault.

22:34.920 --> 22:37.725
You just don't know when it's gonna be
the last time you get to talk to someone.

22:40.759 --> 22:43.000
I never even got to say goodbye.

22:46.698 --> 22:48.336
I know.

23:05.984 --> 23:07.319
Pete.

23:07.419 --> 23:09.064
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:09.621 --> 23:11.161
Can you talk?

23:11.690 --> 23:13.125
Yeah, sure.

23:13.225 --> 23:14.226
Okay.

23:15.794 --> 23:18.497
I haven't gotten a chance
to check in with you yet.

23:18.597 --> 23:20.042
Are you doing okay?

23:21.032 --> 23:22.409
I guess.

23:22.567 --> 23:24.703
I can't bring myself
to erase her voicemails.

23:24.803 --> 23:27.283
I keep listening to them
and it's like she's here, you know?

23:27.572 --> 23:30.416
Leaving me messages, making plans.

23:30.775 --> 23:34.450
Before Debbie died, did you
notice anything going on with her?

23:35.280 --> 23:36.816
Like what?

23:37.382 --> 23:38.986
Acting different.

23:40.451 --> 23:42.454
Yeah, she seemed worried
about something.

23:42.754 --> 23:44.256
Did she ever say what it was?

23:46.558 --> 23:48.393
It just kind of started out of nowhere.

23:48.493 --> 23:51.734
I didn't know what was going on.
I'd text her, she'd blow me off.

23:51.897 --> 23:54.741
I thought maybe she wanted to
break up with me or something.

23:55.500 --> 23:58.170
A few days ago, I went to
her house to try to talk to her.

23:58.270 --> 24:01.743
- She didn't even want me to come inside.
- She did the same thing with me.

24:04.609 --> 24:08.452
- Why are you asking me all this?
- I guess I'm just not ready to let her go.

24:10.382 --> 24:11.488
Neither am I.

24:19.858 --> 24:22.805
I don't know. When I'm in the house,
it just feels strange.

24:22.994 --> 24:26.898
- You miss Debbie. We all do.
- No, this is different.

24:26.998 --> 24:28.767
I can't explain it. It's like she's there.

24:28.867 --> 24:32.037
Laine, listen.
Everyone's still in shock, okay?

24:32.137 --> 24:35.740
But those things you were telling me
the other day about feeling guilty,

24:35.840 --> 24:37.478
you don't have to keep
doing this to yourself.

24:38.944 --> 24:41.513
Do you ever feel like even after
someone you love has died,

24:41.613 --> 24:43.684
there's still a way
you can talk to them?

24:43.949 --> 24:46.556
But you can't do that. She's gone.

24:47.719 --> 24:49.955
The board. Isn't that what
you're supposed to do with it?

24:50.055 --> 24:52.001
Yesterday, you said it was just a game.

24:52.791 --> 24:55.927
If we play the game and nothing happens,
then I'll never bring it up again.

24:56.027 --> 24:59.174
But I really wanna try,
so will you guys just do this with me?

25:23.755 --> 25:25.200
Sarah?

25:25.690 --> 25:28.068
I'm heading out. I'll be an hour.

25:28.927 --> 25:30.167
Sarah!

25:30.695 --> 25:33.598
- Yeah?
- I'm going out. I'll be back in a bit.

25:33.698 --> 25:36.105
Hour. Yeah, cool. Got it.

25:44.676 --> 25:46.656
Hey! Get out of here!

25:50.048 --> 25:51.249
What the hell, Laine?

25:51.349 --> 25:53.618
For a minute there,
I actually had a little faith in you.

25:53.718 --> 25:55.452
We hang out. What's wrong with that?

25:55.552 --> 25:58.890
What's wrong with that is that you're
a kid and that guy is too old for you!

25:58.990 --> 26:00.892
All right. Since you can't be left alone,
you're coming with me.

26:00.992 --> 26:04.432
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Get your stuff. I'll be in the car.

26:40.632 --> 26:43.636
I don't wanna be in this house.
It feels wrong.

26:45.403 --> 26:47.405
Look, this is where Debbie died.

26:48.006 --> 26:49.644
We have to play here.

26:51.309 --> 26:52.144
It's okay.

26:53.945 --> 26:55.583
We're all together.

26:57.849 --> 26:59.892
So, where are we gonna do this?

27:06.357 --> 27:07.597
In there.

27:10.028 --> 27:11.630
I'm gonna go and get the board.

27:24.042 --> 27:27.683
How are you even supposed to talk
to someone using a board game?

27:28.446 --> 27:30.782
I mean, like, "Yo, can you hear me?

27:30.882 --> 27:33.988
"Signal's real bad.
I only got, like, one bar in here."

27:34.385 --> 27:38.459
Your sister wants to do this.
So, just zip it and go along.

27:54.205 --> 27:55.507
- Oh, my God!
- Jesus!

27:55.607 --> 27:57.052
- Pete.
- It's okay.

27:57.909 --> 27:59.711
It's just me. I heard you
come in through the front.

27:59.811 --> 28:01.680
What the hell are you doing, man?

28:01.780 --> 28:04.219
I have a spare key for the back.
I come in that way all the time.

28:24.369 --> 28:26.271
- So, let's play.
- Wait.

28:26.371 --> 28:28.606
There's a few rules first.

28:28.706 --> 28:31.109
Like, you're never supposed
to play in a graveyard,

28:31.209 --> 28:34.390
never play alone,
and always say goodbye.

28:34.679 --> 28:36.717
Can we just do this?

28:40.018 --> 28:42.760
I don't even think
I believe in these things,

28:42.921 --> 28:44.756
but I still don't wanna touch it.

28:44.856 --> 28:47.234
Come on. They sell them in toy stores.

28:56.234 --> 28:59.609
Circle the board, once for each of us.

29:09.614 --> 29:11.560
And then you say these words.

29:15.887 --> 29:18.490
"As friends we've gathered,
hearts are true.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.866
"Spirits near, we call to you."

29:22.927 --> 29:25.869
If there's a presence here,
please make yourself known.

29:30.168 --> 29:32.205
Is there a presence here among us?

29:41.446 --> 29:42.847
This is a joke.

29:42.947 --> 29:45.290
Come on, you guys. Who's doing that?

29:51.456 --> 29:54.136
- Sarah, cut it out!
- I'm not pushing it.

30:02.200 --> 30:04.202
Is there something you wanna tell us?

30:09.040 --> 30:11.714
H-I...

30:21.052 --> 30:23.493
It spelled, "Hi, friend."

30:25.023 --> 30:25.924
Hi, friend.

30:29.961 --> 30:32.498
When I was here yesterday, was that you?

30:35.967 --> 30:37.310
Who is this?

30:45.143 --> 30:46.647
Debbie.

30:52.617 --> 30:55.186
Sarah, if that's you pretending to be Debbie,
then that's really messed up.

30:55.286 --> 30:57.649
- I swear it's not me, all right.
- Okay, this is freaking me out.

30:58.049 --> 31:01.870
- Let's just stop it now.
- I'm sorry. Just put your hand back, please.

31:10.735 --> 31:12.241
Debbie,

31:13.938 --> 31:15.508
was there something I could have done?

31:17.575 --> 31:20.283
Was there some way
we could have helped you?

31:21.179 --> 31:24.891
If there's anything you wanna
tell us about why you did...

31:25.450 --> 31:27.430
If you did this to yourself...

31:30.088 --> 31:32.090
Did you really do this?

31:40.698 --> 31:44.937
Guys, calm down. It's an old house.

31:46.304 --> 31:48.409
Laine, keep going.

31:50.808 --> 31:54.279
- Debbie, I miss you.
- I miss you, too.

31:54.379 --> 31:55.722
We all do.

31:55.980 --> 31:58.451
If you can hear us, we just...

31:58.983 --> 32:01.896
I don't know, we just wanted
a chance to say goodbye.

32:25.476 --> 32:27.678
- Laine!
- Iz.

32:27.845 --> 32:31.684
It's not even real, okay?
It's just a game.

32:39.791 --> 32:42.431
It's all the lights. They're all out.

33:22.700 --> 33:25.970
So, be honest.
Was it you moving the planchette?

33:26.070 --> 33:26.871
No.

33:27.472 --> 33:30.043
- You?
- No. No way.

33:30.641 --> 33:32.643
For all we know, it was Laine.

33:33.911 --> 33:36.214
Maybe it was really
something she needed.

33:36.314 --> 33:38.487
Might not have even known
she was doing it.

33:58.436 --> 34:00.638
Is it Debbie? Did she do this?

34:06.177 --> 34:08.179
- Where are you going?
- Just a second.

34:35.072 --> 34:38.443
- Deb, is that you?
- Laine, please stop, okay? It's not her.

34:38.543 --> 34:41.387
What if it is? What if she's
trying to tell me something?

34:55.159 --> 34:56.399
Oh, my God!

34:57.328 --> 34:59.274
- What happened? Are you okay?
- What was that?

34:59.497 --> 35:02.541
I saw a reflection in the mirror,
and then someone pushed me from behind.

35:03.301 --> 35:05.338
Can we just get out of here, please?

35:05.670 --> 35:06.910
Come on.

35:27.191 --> 35:29.767
- Why are you bringing that home?
- It was hers. I want it here.

35:32.263 --> 35:33.231
What?

35:33.331 --> 35:36.167
It's just that you need to believe
that was really Debbie.

35:36.267 --> 35:39.237
You were there. It was weird, right?

35:39.704 --> 35:42.145
Yeah, it was weird.

35:42.707 --> 35:44.448
But I don't know if it means anything.

35:44.675 --> 35:47.879
But what if it's her?
What if she wants to tell me something?

35:48.179 --> 35:52.026
You wanted us to play, we did.
And now we can leave it alone.

35:53.651 --> 35:55.694
Laine, you said goodbye to her.

35:57.054 --> 35:59.800
I know you'll find the moment
when you're ready, but...

36:00.057 --> 36:01.661
I think you can start to move on.

36:05.062 --> 36:06.063
- Good night.
- Good night.

36:56.280 --> 36:58.082
I couldn't sleep last night.

36:58.182 --> 36:59.817
We don't have to talk about it.

36:59.917 --> 37:03.321
I had all these weird dreams.
I keep thinking about being in her house.

37:03.421 --> 37:05.828
Iz, I know you didn't wanna be there.

37:07.792 --> 37:11.295
You did it for me. So, thank you.

37:11.395 --> 37:12.806
I owe you.

37:13.397 --> 37:16.237
Let's just forget the whole deal, yeah?

37:16.767 --> 37:18.212
- Yeah.
- Okay.

37:46.030 --> 37:47.065
Nona, what are you doing?

37:47.431 --> 37:51.510
You should never touch these things.
You used it, didn't you?

37:51.635 --> 37:53.032
It was just once.

37:53.437 --> 37:57.241
Promise me, Laine. Do not go
seeking answers from the dead.

37:57.341 --> 37:58.542
Get rid of the board.

37:58.642 --> 38:01.482
Yeah, I will. I promise, Nona.

39:03.374 --> 39:05.212
Who is that?

40:14.311 --> 40:16.655
Good night, Hank. See you tomorrow.

40:17.147 --> 40:18.820
Oh, hey, can you grab the
garbage on your way out?

40:19.884 --> 40:21.495
Thank you.

41:26.917 --> 41:28.760
Hi, Isabelle.

41:29.920 --> 41:31.365
Where?

41:32.823 --> 41:35.025
No, no, it doesn't sound crazy at all.

41:35.893 --> 41:38.462
I'll pick you up.
I'll be there in a few minutes.

41:44.301 --> 41:48.405
This idea of messages from the board is
nothing more than our unconscious minds.

41:48.505 --> 41:50.774
It's known as the ideomotor effect.

41:50.874 --> 41:55.149
Involuntary motor muscles kick in
which drive the movement of the planchette.

41:55.279 --> 41:58.082
We're simply telling ourselves
what we wanna believe.

42:17.835 --> 42:18.636
Sarah?

42:26.644 --> 42:28.881
- Was that you?
- No, I thought it was you.

42:31.782 --> 42:33.318
Dad, you home?

42:35.552 --> 42:36.553
Dad!

42:37.488 --> 42:38.623
Go!

42:59.643 --> 43:00.611
Do you have your phone?

43:00.711 --> 43:01.779
- No.
- No?

43:01.879 --> 43:03.480
It's outside.

43:03.580 --> 43:05.382
Okay, just be quiet, just be quiet.

43:19.129 --> 43:21.331
Sarah, stay back, okay?

43:49.560 --> 43:51.929
Isabelle was shaking
when I picked her up last night.

43:52.029 --> 43:55.675
I called this morning to check in.
She doesn't even wanna leave the house.

43:56.133 --> 43:57.768
And I saw it, too.

43:57.868 --> 44:01.305
"Hi friend." Carved right into my desk.

44:01.405 --> 44:03.043
Did we all see it?

44:06.110 --> 44:07.316
Debbie's trying to reach us.

44:08.812 --> 44:13.884
- What could she want?
- If we wanna know, we gotta ask her.

44:26.700 --> 44:29.176
I think we should say
the words together.

44:31.435 --> 44:34.505
As friends we've gathered,
hearts are true.

44:34.605 --> 44:38.018
Spirits near, we call to you.

44:40.244 --> 44:43.225
If there's a presence here,
make yourself known.

44:53.624 --> 44:56.995
Debbie, we're all here for you.
We all got your messages. We're here.

45:09.339 --> 45:11.441
Can you show us a sign?

45:12.643 --> 45:14.088
Are you here?

45:39.870 --> 45:41.608
Come on, guys.

45:51.448 --> 45:53.291
You didn't kill yourself, did you?

45:58.889 --> 46:00.157
I knew it.

46:00.257 --> 46:03.201
Debbie, if you didn't do this, who did?

46:04.495 --> 46:06.438
Did someone hurt you? Did someone...

46:09.099 --> 46:11.802
Who did it? Who hurt you?

46:16.807 --> 46:19.214
Debbie, why won't you answer us?

46:23.647 --> 46:24.482
I have a question.

46:28.118 --> 46:31.731
On our first real date
away from everybody else,

46:32.723 --> 46:35.225
we told everybody we went to the fair,

46:35.325 --> 46:37.737
but where did we really go?

46:41.965 --> 46:43.418
We went to the lookout.

46:45.636 --> 46:47.474
By the point, in the canyon.

46:49.006 --> 46:50.629
Do you remember that?

46:51.975 --> 46:53.247
What I said to you?

47:01.051 --> 47:02.223
This isn't Debbie.

47:02.719 --> 47:04.087
What do you mean?

47:04.187 --> 47:07.733
I never took her there. Not once.

47:08.125 --> 47:09.363
Is this you, Debbie?

47:12.729 --> 47:14.934
Then who the hell is this?

47:16.566 --> 47:17.367
"D."

47:21.638 --> 47:22.844
"Z."

47:28.278 --> 47:30.085
Is this who we were
talking to the other night?

47:31.448 --> 47:34.185
Oh, my God.
Were we ever talking to Debbie?

47:37.354 --> 47:39.356
Laine, we can stop.

47:39.523 --> 47:42.103
When Debbie played the Ouija,
did she make contact with you?

47:45.562 --> 47:46.866
D.Z., where are you?

47:50.734 --> 47:51.769
The chair.

48:16.426 --> 48:17.461
I don't see anything.

48:17.561 --> 48:21.038
Guys, I think we should get out of...

48:25.102 --> 48:26.103
"Run"?

48:30.707 --> 48:32.945
- "She's coming."
- Who's coming?

48:36.413 --> 48:38.017
"Mother."

49:01.405 --> 49:03.140
- Sarah, wait!
- What happened in there, Laine?

49:03.240 --> 49:05.420
It doesn't matter,
because we're not playing anymore.

49:05.709 --> 49:08.578
Okay? We're walking away from
the board, the whole thing.

49:08.678 --> 49:11.181
Debbie played, and now she's dead.

49:11.281 --> 49:15.260
Look, what if we made the same mistake?
What if we broke some sort of rule?

49:17.220 --> 49:18.221
Hey.

49:18.655 --> 49:21.226
Hey. We're finished with this, okay?

50:33.397 --> 50:35.807
Operation Clean House.

50:37.033 --> 50:38.510
I get to clean

50:40.771 --> 50:41.906
the attic!

50:42.072 --> 50:43.244
God.

50:44.040 --> 50:47.715
All right. Attic done.
I did the best I could.

50:49.379 --> 50:51.515
I'm not gonna lie, that was not fun.

50:51.615 --> 50:53.925
However, I did find something.

50:54.384 --> 50:56.996
Along with a lot of old junk
from the previous owners.

50:59.156 --> 51:01.919
Ta-da! It's cool, right? Oh.

51:04.694 --> 51:07.570
- They go together.
- She found it in her house.

51:08.298 --> 51:10.600
Do I like my find?

51:14.738 --> 51:18.041
Yes. Am I cleaning the attic again? No.

51:27.117 --> 51:28.855
Answer my question. I'm waiting.

51:32.589 --> 51:33.761
"R."

51:34.291 --> 51:36.493
She played alone?

51:44.701 --> 51:47.731
"H-I-F-R-I-E-N-D." Whoa.

51:49.039 --> 51:50.274
"Hi, friend."

53:34.244 --> 53:38.053
As you know, our community has been
devastated the last few weeks.

53:39.182 --> 53:42.286
First with Debbie, and now, Isabelle.

53:43.820 --> 53:45.490
I wanted to talk to
each of you because...

53:46.323 --> 53:48.733
I just wanna make sure
you and your friends are okay.

53:49.025 --> 53:53.230
When you lose someone close to you,
there's always help available.

53:53.330 --> 53:54.841
We care about you.

53:55.465 --> 53:57.228
Now...

53:57.328 --> 54:00.482
there's a lot of very,
very helpful information in here

54:00.582 --> 54:04.117
about dealing with loss
and moving forward.

54:04.307 --> 54:06.546
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

54:08.278 --> 54:11.219
- Laine, we're only trying to help you.
- You can't.

54:11.815 --> 54:13.817
I'm not even sure who can.

54:15.252 --> 54:16.953
Trevor.

54:17.053 --> 54:19.194
We need to talk. All of us.

54:22.125 --> 54:24.661
You made us play. Now, Isabelle's dead.

54:24.761 --> 54:27.063
I know, and I'll never forgive myself.

54:27.163 --> 54:30.039
This thing, it's haunting us,

54:30.667 --> 54:34.043
wherever we go,
watching everything we do.

54:34.371 --> 54:37.545
It's coming for all of us.
So, who's next?

54:43.012 --> 54:44.281
Hey.

54:44.381 --> 54:45.949
- Look, back there with Trevor...
- He's right.

54:46.049 --> 54:49.730
Hey, I need you. It's just us now.

54:50.020 --> 54:51.929
What does this spirit wanna do with us?

54:52.322 --> 54:56.893
It's angry. When Debbie played,
she woke something up in her house.

54:56.993 --> 54:58.536
Okay?

54:58.828 --> 55:00.967
Pete, please. I need your help.

55:50.513 --> 55:52.759
I think that's where Debbie found it.

57:56.906 --> 57:58.579
Laine, are you all right?

58:00.343 --> 58:03.254
- Laine!
- I'm coming!

58:12.221 --> 58:13.627
Pete.

58:14.924 --> 58:16.164
Pete, grab this.

58:19.162 --> 58:21.332
It's heavy. Okay.

58:56.699 --> 58:57.600
Laine!

59:08.711 --> 59:11.080
Hey, this is the family.

59:11.180 --> 59:14.150
For some reason,
they're still connected to the house.

59:14.250 --> 59:17.353
From the look of these photos, I'd say
this is the late '40s, the early '50s.

59:17.453 --> 59:19.122
Is there a way to get any records?

59:19.222 --> 59:22.066
I don't know.
Property archives or something?

59:22.191 --> 59:23.534
I can try.

59:23.893 --> 59:25.895
We need to find out who they are.

59:40.810 --> 59:42.448
Laine, you should come look at this.

59:47.584 --> 59:48.924
I found this old article.

59:51.754 --> 59:54.090
Doris Zander.

59:54.190 --> 59:56.900
D.Z. This is her.

59:59.762 --> 01:00:02.476
Pete, listen. Doris Zander.

01:00:02.832 --> 01:00:05.401
She used to live in
Debbie's house with her mother.

01:00:05.501 --> 01:00:08.373
D.Z. was a missing girl.
They never found her.

01:00:10.106 --> 01:00:13.380
They suspected the mother had something
to do with her disappearance.

01:00:15.678 --> 01:00:17.922
So, who is the other girl
in the pictures with them?

01:00:21.851 --> 01:00:23.762
Doris had a sister.

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:26.500
And she might still be alive.

01:00:38.568 --> 01:00:39.911
May I help you?

01:00:40.436 --> 01:00:42.846
I'm here for visiting hours.

01:01:06.262 --> 01:01:07.802
Thank you.

01:01:10.366 --> 01:01:13.236
They told me my niece was here to visit.

01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:14.713
I don't have a niece.

01:01:15.004 --> 01:01:19.112
My name is Laine. I'm here to
ask about your sister, Doris.

01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:22.078
Doris.

01:01:22.178 --> 01:01:25.757
My best friend, Debbie,
lived in your old house.

01:01:27.416 --> 01:01:29.418
She's not alive anymore.

01:01:31.921 --> 01:01:34.561
And this is gonna sound
really strange but...

01:01:35.291 --> 01:01:37.862
but I think I know why.

01:01:39.028 --> 01:01:41.269
I believe there's a
presence in that house.

01:01:42.365 --> 01:01:45.646
I wouldn't be surprised
if there's more than one.

01:01:47.637 --> 01:01:49.981
I found pictures of you and your sister.

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:54.144
You found pictures?
You found my family photos?

01:01:54.377 --> 01:01:56.913
Yeah. I can bring them to you,
or send them, if you like.

01:01:57.013 --> 01:01:58.815
Please bring them.

01:01:58.915 --> 01:02:03.686
I haven't seen my sister's face
in a very long time.

01:02:04.954 --> 01:02:07.197
At least not her real face.

01:02:12.161 --> 01:02:16.034
I believe I saw her.
Me and my friends. And her lips,

01:02:16.666 --> 01:02:18.809
they were stitched shut.

01:02:20.803 --> 01:02:23.010
Mother did that to her.

01:02:33.583 --> 01:02:36.195
My mother practiced mediumship.

01:02:36.686 --> 01:02:38.387
And if practice makes perfect,
let me tell you,

01:02:38.487 --> 01:02:41.624
she was pretty damn good,
depending on your point of view.

01:02:42.124 --> 01:02:46.231
She conducted séances,
she used spirit boards. Anything.

01:02:46.529 --> 01:02:50.033
A bit reckless, actually.
Doris loved my mother.

01:02:50.166 --> 01:02:54.378
She wanted to help.
She was fascinated by it all.

01:02:54.504 --> 01:02:59.442
And when the séances got bigger
and my mother really made connections,

01:02:59.542 --> 01:03:03.079
she needed a vessel.
A vessel to give them a voice.

01:03:03.179 --> 01:03:06.023
- Who?
- The spirits.

01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:09.186
She used Doris.

01:03:11.587 --> 01:03:13.496
And then something
went wrong with Mother.

01:03:13.723 --> 01:03:17.493
Chasing the dead and living in all
those shadows, something snapped.

01:03:17.593 --> 01:03:20.435
She couldn't turn it off.
She couldn't break the connection.

01:03:21.531 --> 01:03:24.038
Mother was consumed by them.

01:03:24.734 --> 01:03:26.042
She was insane.

01:03:28.538 --> 01:03:30.140
So, she did that to Doris.

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:35.088
To her lips. To stop them from talking.

01:03:35.278 --> 01:03:37.424
And then Doris went missing?

01:03:39.582 --> 01:03:41.022
Missing.

01:03:44.086 --> 01:03:45.531
She never left the house, did she?

01:03:45.888 --> 01:03:48.459
No. No, she didn't.

01:03:50.159 --> 01:03:53.499
Mother wasn't herself. She killed Doris.

01:03:54.997 --> 01:03:58.401
And after that, I did what I
needed to do to stop Mother.

01:04:01.837 --> 01:04:03.180
That's why I'm here.

01:04:04.607 --> 01:04:07.114
But that doesn't mean Mother is gone.

01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:15.418
- How did you see her?
- What?

01:04:15.885 --> 01:04:18.321
You said you saw her.

01:04:18.421 --> 01:04:21.424
You said you saw her lips.
How did you see her?

01:04:21.524 --> 01:04:23.859
You wouldn't have been able
to see her. Not unless you...

01:04:23.959 --> 01:04:27.373
Look, I just wanna stop whatever it is
that is happening. My friends are dying.

01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:30.333
No, you opened up a channel.

01:04:30.433 --> 01:04:32.909
You made a connection. With what?

01:04:35.972 --> 01:04:38.207
- A spirit board, I bet.
- Yeah.

01:04:38.307 --> 01:04:41.644
You played in a graveyard,
and now she's awake again.

01:04:41.744 --> 01:04:43.755
Both of them. Mother, too.

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:45.918
And if you could see them...

01:04:46.282 --> 01:04:49.118
- Just through the planchette.
- Not for long.

01:04:49.218 --> 01:04:50.319
They're getting stronger.

01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:55.952
The points of connection. In your case,
it's the body and the board.

01:04:56.052 --> 01:05:00.663
The link is between them.
The energy is growing,

01:05:00.763 --> 01:05:03.175
and it is hard to stop.

01:05:06.335 --> 01:05:08.638
Mother used to have a secret room.

01:05:08.738 --> 01:05:12.117
She sealed it up, after Doris,
down in the basement.

01:05:12.708 --> 01:05:16.012
Don't go alone.
Mother will try to stop you.

01:05:16.112 --> 01:05:17.513
What do I have to do?

01:05:17.613 --> 01:05:20.516
You need to cut the stitches
from her mouth.

01:05:20.616 --> 01:05:25.725
And if it works, you have to pray
that Doris can deal with Mother.

01:05:27.156 --> 01:05:30.669
It's supposed to be somewhere here.
Pete, grab this.

01:05:38.134 --> 01:05:40.136
This is crazy, Laine.

01:05:41.537 --> 01:05:43.710
We should just leave.
We shouldn't be here.

01:05:46.876 --> 01:05:48.048
What?

01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:49.919
The shadow.

01:05:55.117 --> 01:05:56.584
Trevor!

01:05:59.922 --> 01:06:01.094
Trevor!

01:06:04.493 --> 01:06:07.071
Pete! Trevor! Pete!

01:06:12.968 --> 01:06:15.571
Laine! Keep going!

01:06:16.539 --> 01:06:18.382
Sarah, I need your help!

01:07:47.329 --> 01:07:48.330
Laine!

01:07:48.764 --> 01:07:50.766
Stay there. I found her.

01:07:54.603 --> 01:07:57.106
No, no, no, not now.

01:07:57.273 --> 01:08:00.113
Come on. Stop. Come on!

01:08:12.454 --> 01:08:13.626
Come on.

01:08:40.515 --> 01:08:41.517
Come on.

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:44.120
No!

01:09:20.122 --> 01:09:22.925
- Are you guys okay?
- Yeah.

01:09:23.024 --> 01:09:24.520
Where's Laine?

01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:21.723
Okay, to our future selves,
I hope we look back on this, and...

01:10:22.051 --> 01:10:23.452
- No, it looks so good.
- My boobs look huge.

01:10:23.552 --> 01:10:25.487
Okay, turn around.
What does it look like in the back?

01:10:25.587 --> 01:10:27.291
Hold on. Let me see.

01:10:27.456 --> 01:10:29.331
- You look so beautiful!
- I know.

01:10:29.431 --> 01:10:31.895
- Thank you.
- Oh, my babies. Look at my angels.

01:10:38.767 --> 01:10:41.914
I miss you, Debbie. All the time.

01:11:03.625 --> 01:11:05.131
Debbie?

01:12:18.967 --> 01:12:19.768
Ms. Zander.

01:12:20.202 --> 01:12:23.439
Oh. My tenacious little niece.

01:12:23.539 --> 01:12:25.374
I did everything you said.

01:12:25.474 --> 01:12:28.177
We found the body, I cut the stitches,
she sent Mother away.

01:12:28.277 --> 01:12:30.052
But it didn't work. Why didn't it work?

01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:34.554
Mother must have come back, because my
friend Pete, another friend, is dead.

01:12:40.589 --> 01:12:41.590
She's free.

01:12:43.058 --> 01:12:44.696
You lied to me.

01:12:49.064 --> 01:12:52.477
Your mother didn't try to hurt us.
She tried to stop us.

01:12:55.103 --> 01:12:57.397
Your mother wasn't
the one that was evil.

01:12:57.497 --> 01:13:01.417
- It was...
- I told her that I would help her.

01:13:04.112 --> 01:13:05.989
I heard the voices, too.

01:13:06.448 --> 01:13:10.120
They tell you the most wonderful,

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:12.976
awful things.

01:13:14.623 --> 01:13:18.397
You're gonna hear them, too,
little girl.

01:13:19.294 --> 01:13:23.970
You'll hear them soon enough
because she's coming to get you, too.

01:13:24.633 --> 01:13:27.636
- I always told her. I told her.
- Ms. Zander.

01:13:27.803 --> 01:13:30.939
She's gonna be nice to me.
She knows I was gonna help her

01:13:31.039 --> 01:13:33.242
- and now she's gonna be nice to me.
- Calm down. You have to calm down.

01:13:33.442 --> 01:13:35.444
She's gonna keep her promises!

01:13:36.345 --> 01:13:38.256
She's gonna keep her promises!

01:13:38.614 --> 01:13:39.849
No! No!

01:13:42.985 --> 01:13:47.030
You have to break the connection
or it will keep coming back for you.

01:13:47.356 --> 01:13:49.758
- I'll burn the board.
- That won't be enough.

01:13:49.858 --> 01:13:51.804
A spirit this strong
could bring it back.

01:13:52.528 --> 01:13:56.098
A connection, once made to a spirit,
is very difficult to break.

01:13:56.198 --> 01:14:00.065
The board is just the conduit.
You have to sever the connection

01:14:00.165 --> 01:14:01.514
- on both sides.
- How?

01:14:01.614 --> 01:14:05.541
Your connection is through the board
and that little girl's body.

01:14:05.641 --> 01:14:09.081
The spirit lives through both of them,
so you must destroy them both.

01:14:09.181 --> 01:14:12.891
- What? Destroy the body?
- And the board. And you must hurry.

01:14:13.015 --> 01:14:15.586
- I'll call Trevor.
- Thank you.

01:14:33.135 --> 01:14:34.708
- Trevor.
- Sarah?

01:14:34.937 --> 01:14:36.580
We're back here.

01:14:37.305 --> 01:14:38.479
Wait up!

01:14:55.190 --> 01:14:56.528
Sarah?

01:14:59.861 --> 01:15:01.199
Laine?

01:15:24.886 --> 01:15:26.593
Trevor's already here.

01:15:34.162 --> 01:15:35.366
Trevor!

01:15:39.434 --> 01:15:40.942
Where is he?

01:16:30.485 --> 01:16:31.486
Trevor?

01:16:42.197 --> 01:16:43.808
No!

01:16:58.346 --> 01:17:00.116
Laine, what do we do?

01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:03.293
Laine!

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:06.822
Go get the board.

01:17:29.311 --> 01:17:31.753
- We need the body, too.
- Let's burn this damn thing...

01:17:34.549 --> 01:17:36.687
- Laine!
- Sarah!

01:17:37.519 --> 01:17:39.021
Sarah!

01:18:07.449 --> 01:18:08.250
Hey!

01:18:17.659 --> 01:18:20.328
As friends we've gathered,
hearts are true.

01:18:20.428 --> 01:18:22.101
Spirits near, we call to you.

01:18:23.798 --> 01:18:25.700
Doris, I'm playing alone!
You have to play!

01:20:44.739 --> 01:20:46.111
Hey.

01:20:47.008 --> 01:20:51.313
- Feeling any better?
- Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

01:20:51.813 --> 01:20:54.049
I just miss them.

01:20:54.149 --> 01:20:55.953
All the time.

01:20:56.251 --> 01:20:58.021
Yeah, me too.

01:20:58.820 --> 01:21:01.489
I guess you never really feel like
you get to say goodbye

01:21:01.589 --> 01:21:04.160
and maybe that's okay.

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:08.665
Oh, well... Maybe there are no goodbyes.

01:21:09.597 --> 01:21:11.299
Not really.

01:21:17.238 --> 01:21:19.345
I keep wondering about that night.

01:21:21.576 --> 01:21:23.585
That poor little girl.

01:21:26.281 --> 01:21:29.524
