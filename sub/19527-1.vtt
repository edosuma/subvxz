03:03.100 --> 03:05.262
Come on now.
Wait till you see this.

03:06.478 --> 03:07.844
Who is he?

03:09.147 --> 03:10.888
Know who he is?

03:11.191 --> 03:12.853
Don't know why he ended up here.

03:13.151 --> 03:15.734
Got no wallet.
Not a penny in his pocket.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.021
His bus was comin'
from New York City.

03:18.323 --> 03:20.565
He mighta gotten on anywhere
between there and here.

03:20.867 --> 03:24.451
Poor fella. These are worker's
hands. Could be a farmer.

03:24.746 --> 03:28.865
Is that a Chinaman, Dr. Gilbert?
Sure is, Zack.

03:29.167 --> 03:31.124
What's your name, boy?

03:31.420 --> 03:32.956
Ohta.

03:35.173 --> 03:38.587
Don't even talk English.
Apparently not.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.235
Hitler now appears
in full garb...

04:39.529 --> 04:41.316
Thank you, Matilda.
of a European revolutionary.

04:41.615 --> 04:45.199
We've collected a full barrel of
warm woolens to send to England.

04:45.494 --> 04:49.534
That Samille, she knits as fast as a
fiend, Gil. I don't know how she does it.

04:49.831 --> 04:51.914
Anne, I am trying
to talk to you.

04:55.462 --> 04:57.624
What is it
you want from me, Gilbert?

04:57.923 --> 05:01.007
The fella just needs a place to
rest till he gets his strength back.

05:01.301 --> 05:04.715
Mm-hmm. And you thought
my cottage would suit.

05:05.013 --> 05:08.882
Anne, you've not used
the cottage in years,

05:09.184 --> 05:10.300
since Scott passed.

05:10.602 --> 05:12.685
No. No need for quiet.

05:12.979 --> 05:15.767
With Scott gone,
the whole house is quiet.

05:16.066 --> 05:18.183
I can write my garden column
wherever I want to.

05:18.485 --> 05:21.603
He'll be up and about in a week.
Maybe two.

05:21.905 --> 05:24.943
And then we'll send him
on his way.

05:25.242 --> 05:27.905
And I'll be keepin' an eye
on him too, Mrs. Morrison.

06:04.406 --> 06:05.817
Here.

06:11.496 --> 06:13.158
The poor man.

06:24.926 --> 06:26.713
O- Oh...

06:28.305 --> 06:29.796
Ohta.

06:31.433 --> 06:32.674
Ohta?

06:34.603 --> 06:36.265
Is that your name?

07:00.670 --> 07:02.457
Oh, Sophie.
What's wrong?

07:02.756 --> 07:05.089
Oh! What a horrible day.

07:05.383 --> 07:07.670
Did you forget we planned to go
to a picture show in Brunswick?

07:07.969 --> 07:09.756
Yes, forgive me, not today.

07:11.389 --> 07:14.598
I got a Chinaman in my cottage
and Matilda just quit.

07:14.893 --> 07:18.057
Why on earth?
Never mind.

07:18.355 --> 07:20.938
It's all just a nuisance.

07:21.232 --> 07:25.192
Well, I saw that oriental man in
town. He was very dark. And dirty too.

07:27.530 --> 07:28.646
Sophie.

07:40.377 --> 07:41.208
Sophie!

07:43.380 --> 07:44.746
Sophie!

07:47.092 --> 07:48.958
Oh, Anne!

07:49.260 --> 07:50.876
What on earth happened?

07:53.264 --> 07:57.053
Oh, why you so sad today, honey?

07:59.229 --> 08:01.892
Mama sent my friend away.

08:02.190 --> 08:03.726
Let me get
that hair out of your face.

08:32.761 --> 08:37.256
Oh, Sophie. Poverty's
no reason to demean yourself.

08:40.061 --> 08:41.768
Good morning, sweet John.

08:43.148 --> 08:45.606
Are you ready
for some breakfast?

08:47.402 --> 08:48.768
Thank you, Kendall.

08:50.405 --> 08:52.488
It's so good.

08:53.575 --> 08:55.487
It's special.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.822
Here we are, sweetheart.

08:58.121 --> 08:59.703
That's...
Good morning, Ruth.

08:59.998 --> 09:01.284
Mornin', darling.
Good morning, son.

09:01.583 --> 09:03.040
Mm.

09:03.334 --> 09:06.543
Have a wonderful day.
Thank you, sweetheart. You too.

09:08.798 --> 09:11.632
Have another bite. That's good.

09:11.926 --> 09:13.417
Okay, one more.

09:15.013 --> 09:17.596
Autumn is my favorite
season in the South.

09:17.891 --> 09:22.101
It is the season of amaryllis and
our gardens are filled with them.

09:22.395 --> 09:25.638
Red spider lilies,
Lycoris radiata,

09:25.940 --> 09:29.433
are most especially lovely
and abundant.

09:29.736 --> 09:32.774
Yes? I really must put some
spider lilies in next spring.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.190
Oh, when I divide mine this
year, you're welcome to some.

09:35.492 --> 09:37.199
Why, thank you.

09:37.494 --> 09:41.579
Anne, how is the Chinaman?
He seems to be coming along.

09:41.873 --> 09:46.538
Well, as the Missionary Ladies Society,
we feel some responsibility for him.

09:46.836 --> 09:49.078
That's very kind,
but not necessary, Ruth.

09:49.380 --> 09:51.622
W- Well, you know, we've been
feedin' him a-all week,

09:51.925 --> 09:54.338
so we'd like to see
how the patient's doin'.

09:54.636 --> 09:58.050
Mr. Ohta really isn't well
enough for visitors, I'm afraid.

09:58.348 --> 10:01.011
Is Ohta his name?
Yes, I believe it is.

10:01.309 --> 10:05.519
It doesn't even sound
like a real name.

10:05.814 --> 10:09.398
Well, I don't think that
he'd mind us just lookin' in.

10:13.988 --> 10:18.403
We are the Missionary
Ladies Society, Mr. Oh-ay-ta.

10:18.701 --> 10:22.035
It's Mr. Ohta, Ruth,
and he can hear you.

10:22.330 --> 10:25.949
Well, I wanted to be sure that
he understands our language.

10:26.251 --> 10:28.743
Oh, he understands.
He understands.

10:29.045 --> 10:33.961
Well, we are deeply concerned
about your well-bein'.

10:34.259 --> 10:36.046
Fattenin' up is all you need.

10:36.344 --> 10:38.711
You'll be up and fit
for travel in no time.

10:42.183 --> 10:45.017
Thank you.
Oh, he speaks English!

10:45.311 --> 10:47.268
Okay. Thank you.
Bye-bye now. I'll bring some...

10:47.564 --> 10:48.771
Feel better.

12:25.912 --> 12:28.871
Well... good morning to you.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.128
Huh.

12:36.422 --> 12:39.290
This isn't where
I intended to plant them,

12:39.592 --> 12:41.003
but they look very nice.

12:43.304 --> 12:44.840
I'm glad you approve.

12:45.139 --> 12:48.553
I wouldn't want you to overexert
yourself. You have been very ill.

12:48.851 --> 12:51.810
I am feeling much better.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.186
Thank you.

12:56.025 --> 12:58.563
Why, your English is just fine.

12:58.861 --> 13:02.445
And you... seem to understand
every word I say.

13:02.740 --> 13:04.026
Yes.

13:06.035 --> 13:08.823
I'm Mrs. Anne Morrison.

13:09.122 --> 13:12.456
You landed yourself
in Salty Creek, South Carolina.

13:13.334 --> 13:15.121
This is my house.

13:15.420 --> 13:18.037
And... my garden.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.635
Isabel Culpepper's
bringin' your dinner.

13:24.929 --> 13:27.421
Baked ham and pecan pie.

13:27.724 --> 13:29.886
It's bound to knock
your socks off.

13:34.022 --> 13:36.480
The hydrangeas look
very nice over there.

13:38.192 --> 13:42.186
I'm gettin' tired of all
these fussy flower beds. Yes.

13:42.488 --> 13:47.574
Are you a gardener
by... by profession, Mr. Ohta?

13:47.869 --> 13:50.703
- It is something I enjoy.
- Anne!

13:50.997 --> 13:52.829
I know you're out here
on such a lovely day.

13:53.124 --> 13:56.083
I brought my watercolors.
Sophie!

13:56.377 --> 13:58.118
This is Mr. Ohta.

13:58.421 --> 14:03.041
Mr. Ohta, I
- I'd like to introduce you to Miss Sophie Willis.

14:03.343 --> 14:06.552
How do you do, Miss Willis?
Very well, thank you.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.758
I hope your health
is improvin', Mr. Ohta.

14:11.100 --> 14:15.219
I think you should rest now.
You've exhausted yourself.

14:15.521 --> 14:18.559
Good day, Mrs. Morrison.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.269
Miss Sophie.

14:25.031 --> 14:28.741
Is there anything in particular
you'd like me to paint?

14:29.035 --> 14:31.869
I'm writing my column
about autumn.

14:32.163 --> 14:34.701
The perfect time
to move your plants.

14:37.001 --> 14:42.372
Well, this says that Shirley Temple
is making a comeback at 12 years old.

14:42.673 --> 14:45.131
A comeback?

14:48.096 --> 14:52.181
You know, they say Clark Gable
brushes his own hair on set.

14:52.475 --> 14:55.092
Well, he's such a regular guy.
Isn't he?

14:55.395 --> 14:59.560
I just love him. You know, I heard
that he lets the... the regular boys

14:59.857 --> 15:01.689
come into his trailer
and watch the ball game.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.693
Where were you headed
on that bus, Mr. Ohta?

16:01.294 --> 16:04.128
And where were you comin' from?

16:04.422 --> 16:07.665
I'd rather not say,
Mrs. Morrison.

16:07.967 --> 16:11.176
I understand if that
makes you uncomfortable.

16:13.306 --> 16:16.890
You're still not fit to go anywhere.
Just gettin' your strength back.

16:36.496 --> 16:40.410
I just thought your... your family
must be very worried about ya.

18:07.253 --> 18:09.210
Can I help you?

18:09.505 --> 18:12.043
I'm Salome Whitmore.

18:12.341 --> 18:15.550
I heard you're lookin' for a
housekeeper. Where'd you hear that?

18:15.845 --> 18:19.009
Folks talk.
I'm a good worker.

18:22.351 --> 18:24.764
And foreigners don't bother me.

18:25.062 --> 18:26.678
Do you have any references,
Salome?

18:26.981 --> 18:29.064
No, ma'am.

18:29.358 --> 18:31.600
I just moved back here.

18:31.902 --> 18:33.689
Hmm. I see.

18:36.949 --> 18:39.783
I'll keep your house cleaner
than you ever seen it.

18:40.077 --> 18:41.989
I'll work for you
the first week free,

18:42.288 --> 18:43.995
see if you pleased
with my work.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.541
That won't be necessary.

18:50.004 --> 18:52.917
I don't like being hovered over.

18:53.215 --> 18:56.799
The house is a mess. My former
housekeeper left a week ago.

18:57.094 --> 18:59.086
Got your work cut out for ya.

18:59.388 --> 19:01.471
I'm used to folks
bein' dirty.

19:01.766 --> 19:04.383
Most of 'em's downright filthy
if you ask me.

19:06.646 --> 19:09.559
Well, you show up 8:00 tomorrow.

19:10.608 --> 19:12.395
Thank you, ma'am.
Sharp.

20:13.337 --> 20:16.421
You gonna buy that newspaper?

20:18.592 --> 20:19.958
No, sir.

20:23.764 --> 20:26.177
Do you have any
late season plants?

20:27.226 --> 20:29.388
For Mrs. Morrison.

20:29.687 --> 20:31.349
Over there.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.820
These are the most beautiful.

20:51.333 --> 20:54.997
I do not garden, Mr. Ohta. I'm
just looking at the illustrations.

21:25.034 --> 21:26.366
Mr. Ohta.

21:28.245 --> 21:31.238
Uh, when you finish your lunch,
um, please come into the house.

21:36.587 --> 21:37.953
Uh, my deceased...

21:40.341 --> 21:42.253
Scott's things
are in that trunk.

21:45.179 --> 21:47.045
Help yourself to some clothes.

21:54.605 --> 21:56.062
Take whatever you need.

22:00.778 --> 22:02.064
Thank you, Miss Anne.

22:03.989 --> 22:07.278
I can't bring myself
to throw them out, and, uh,

22:07.576 --> 22:09.738
I hate to see things
go to waste.

22:17.795 --> 22:19.878
Mr. Morrison loved poetry?

22:20.172 --> 22:21.413
Oh, yes.

22:22.925 --> 22:24.166
So do I.

22:24.468 --> 22:26.084
You can read?

22:29.723 --> 22:33.433
Forgive me. That was...
That was very rude.

22:53.581 --> 22:55.823
Wordsworth was his favorite.

23:01.171 --> 23:02.287
Here.

23:09.138 --> 23:10.925
I'll leave you to it.

23:18.856 --> 23:22.395
"Since the spirit of God
dwells in you,

23:22.693 --> 23:25.902
anyone who does not have
the Spirit of Christ

23:26.196 --> 23:29.030
does not belong to Him.

23:29.325 --> 23:31.237
Christ is in you,

23:31.535 --> 23:34.448
though the body is dead
because of sin,

23:34.747 --> 23:38.491
the Spirit is life
because of the righteousness."

24:07.738 --> 24:11.197
Excuse me.
This was the only path I found.

24:14.244 --> 24:16.110
Anne gave you Scott's paints.

24:16.413 --> 24:19.030
Yes, and other things.

24:23.712 --> 24:25.044
Excuse me.

24:27.883 --> 24:30.216
I find this the most
beautiful spot to paint.

25:32.489 --> 25:35.277
Hitler will get
a good fight from the Russians.

25:35.576 --> 25:39.240
The Germans won't be stopped
unless America enters the war.

25:39.538 --> 25:41.154
Someone's gotta stop 'em.

25:41.457 --> 25:44.495
Well, let the Europeans
make-do without us this time.

25:44.793 --> 25:46.910
But they're transporting
all the Jews out of the cities.

25:47.212 --> 25:51.456
Oh, Anne,
that's just rumors. Unproven.

25:54.887 --> 25:57.049
How's John?
I haven't seen him in some time.

25:57.347 --> 25:59.134
He's at church, Anne.

25:59.433 --> 26:01.846
Every Sunday, plain to see.

26:03.479 --> 26:06.222
I'm just so glad you're
still able to take him out.

26:06.523 --> 26:08.264
How's the Chinaman doin'?

26:08.567 --> 26:10.934
Better, I hope.
Oh, yes.

26:11.236 --> 26:13.649
He's making a fine recovery.

26:13.947 --> 26:16.985
Well, I stopped by
to suggest that, uh, your...

26:21.038 --> 26:22.904
May I help myself to a cookie?

26:23.707 --> 26:26.165
Certainly.

26:26.460 --> 26:27.996
Looks delicious.

26:30.339 --> 26:32.376
Mmm, mmm.

26:36.386 --> 26:37.672
Thank you.

26:38.806 --> 26:41.173
I stopped by to suggest

26:41.475 --> 26:47.221
that your new girl take the Chinaman
over to the African Methodist Church.

26:47.523 --> 26:48.889
Why can't he go to your church?

26:50.234 --> 26:51.190
Oh, Anne!

26:52.027 --> 26:53.143
Why not?

26:53.445 --> 26:56.734
Well, do I have to spell it out?

26:59.576 --> 27:01.738
He's not white.

27:02.037 --> 27:04.529
Well, he's not Negro either.

27:04.832 --> 27:07.540
Well, he's yellow
and that's colored.

27:22.307 --> 27:24.720
Good morning.
Morning.

27:48.292 --> 27:50.659
I think you've forgotten
I'm here.

27:51.795 --> 27:53.081
Not possible.

27:59.761 --> 28:01.218
I must be goin'.

28:15.152 --> 28:16.438
May I see?

28:22.826 --> 28:24.783
You have an unusual style.

28:28.332 --> 28:29.573
See you next Sunday?

28:41.220 --> 28:43.428
Comrade
in Russian means "Kamerad,"

28:43.722 --> 28:45.429
which is "surrender" in German.

28:45.724 --> 28:48.387
These are believed to be
the Nazi battle plans

28:48.685 --> 28:50.142
for the Near East and Africa.

28:50.437 --> 28:53.680
Sophie Willis is here.

28:53.982 --> 28:57.146
- to the north against Turkey, to the south...
- Anne, what is it?

28:59.446 --> 29:03.531
Those damn Nazis, they're...
they're slaughtering the Soviets.

29:03.825 --> 29:05.487
...where the heavily
outnumbered British...

29:08.330 --> 29:12.449
So sorry, Anne. I can't
believe it's happenin' again.

29:14.586 --> 29:17.704
Oh, do sit down.
Would you like some tea?

29:18.006 --> 29:21.090
- Do I have to sit?
- Well, no, you don't.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.423
I think I have autumn fever.

29:24.721 --> 29:28.010
Autumn fever?

29:28.308 --> 29:30.846
I never heard of that, but
it certainly agrees with you.

29:36.984 --> 29:39.351
Oh, come see my garden.

29:39.653 --> 29:41.861
It hadn't looked so beautiful
since Scott died.

29:55.335 --> 29:59.625
Have you ever seen
hydrangeas looking more perfect?

29:59.923 --> 30:00.709
Mm-mm.

30:06.430 --> 30:10.765
Wherever he comes from, he was
raised with the best manners.

30:13.061 --> 30:14.893
Anne, let's take in
the picture show in Brunswick

30:15.188 --> 30:16.929
and then dinner
at the Belmont Hotel.

30:17.232 --> 30:19.144
I'm afraid I wouldn't be
very good company.

30:19.443 --> 30:21.184
I'm just too preoccupied
with the war news.

30:21.486 --> 30:25.730
Oh, dear Anne,
your mood hardly matters to me.

30:26.033 --> 30:27.524
In their occupation of Nanking,

30:27.826 --> 30:31.536
the Japs again outdid themselves
in barbarism.

30:31.830 --> 30:35.949
The helpless populace was attacked
by the city walls and could not flee.

30:38.962 --> 30:41.625
Japanese soldiers went berserk.

30:41.923 --> 30:44.506
They raped and tortured.

30:44.801 --> 30:46.918
They killed and butchered.

30:51.058 --> 30:52.424
Again!

30:55.187 --> 30:57.895
In one of the bloodiest
massacres of recorded history,

30:58.190 --> 31:02.810
they murdered 40,000 men,
women, children.

31:05.030 --> 31:06.441
No.

31:15.040 --> 31:18.784
I've never been able to paint
the sky exactly as I like.

31:19.086 --> 31:21.373
I avoid the sky
when I paint.

31:21.671 --> 31:23.628
It's impossible to capture.

31:26.385 --> 31:28.297
I don't even know
your first name.

31:30.013 --> 31:33.472
Grover.
Grover?

31:35.102 --> 31:37.936
I am the first son
born in America.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.392
So you have brothers
who were born in China?

31:40.690 --> 31:42.977
Japan.

31:43.276 --> 31:46.565
I was born in California.

31:46.863 --> 31:48.820
Everyone thinks you're Chinese.

31:51.076 --> 31:52.567
I don't mind.

32:56.349 --> 32:59.968
Look! That clematis
you suggested arrived.

33:00.270 --> 33:03.729
Here it is.
Very good.

33:04.024 --> 33:05.811
Oh, I do hope it survives.

33:06.109 --> 33:09.227
This is the one with the
same bloom time as this rose.

33:09.529 --> 33:12.397
- Do we plant it next to the rose?
- A foot away.

33:12.699 --> 33:16.784
It will attach itself to the
rose and climb to 20 feet.

33:17.078 --> 33:21.539
The purple of the clematis
and this pink will be beautiful.

33:21.833 --> 33:23.199
Sounds gorgeous.

33:23.502 --> 33:26.119
Oh, my goodness!
Scott would love it!

33:26.421 --> 33:29.209
Anne, you and Mr. Ohta make me
wish I had a garden of my own.

33:29.508 --> 33:31.340
Well, you should
have a garden.

33:31.635 --> 33:33.251
Well, I can paint
just about any flower,

33:33.553 --> 33:35.795
but I don't know a thing
about how to make them grow.

33:36.097 --> 33:38.714
Well, we can't do anything till
we get your yard cleaned up.

33:39.017 --> 33:42.260
May I help?
With your permission, Miss Anne.

33:42.562 --> 33:43.803
Of course.

33:58.245 --> 34:00.111
Grover, did you ever
want to marry?

34:02.791 --> 34:04.748
Yes, of course.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.329
Why didn't you?

34:08.045 --> 34:11.335
My father planned it
with a cousin in Japan,

34:11.632 --> 34:13.625
but she couldn't
come to America.

34:15.929 --> 34:17.795
Are you still waitin'?

34:18.681 --> 34:20.014
No.

34:23.687 --> 34:26.679
I had a sweetheart. Henry.

34:26.982 --> 34:29.018
He died in the Great War.

34:30.527 --> 34:31.643
I'm sorry.

34:34.281 --> 34:35.817
Mama didn't like him.

34:56.511 --> 34:57.342
Grover.

35:00.223 --> 35:01.634
Come here, please.

36:12.253 --> 36:13.585
Delicious.

36:13.880 --> 36:16.122
I've never had crab cakes.

36:16.424 --> 36:18.290
Well, ours are the best
in the South.

36:19.260 --> 36:20.796
I believe it.

36:23.640 --> 36:28.101
I'm not much of a cook
except for recipes with crab.

36:28.395 --> 36:29.727
Cracked crab,

36:30.021 --> 36:33.514
crab gumbo over grits,
she-crab soup,

36:33.817 --> 36:36.275
soft-shell crab
in the spring.

36:36.569 --> 36:37.980
I hope to taste them all.

36:49.624 --> 36:51.832
Why were you on that bus,
Grover?

36:55.714 --> 36:56.625
Apples.

36:57.757 --> 37:00.795
A sweet non sequitur.

37:01.094 --> 37:04.007
The Ohtas grow vegetables
in California.

37:05.849 --> 37:09.138
I wanted to be the first in
the West with an apple orchard.

37:11.271 --> 37:14.480
I worked for years
with different stocks

37:14.774 --> 37:18.438
to develop sweet apples
without the harsh winters.

37:20.822 --> 37:24.111
It took years
to convince my father.

37:24.409 --> 37:28.028
Finally, he invested
a lot of money.

37:28.329 --> 37:29.820
I used all of mine.

37:34.461 --> 37:37.329
I went to New York
to buy 1,000 trees.

37:38.757 --> 37:40.874
I had one day
in New York City.

37:41.176 --> 37:44.044
I treated myself
to a fine dinner.

37:44.345 --> 37:46.382
A Broadway show.

37:46.681 --> 37:48.889
How wonderful.
What a night!

37:49.184 --> 37:51.050
I stopped for a drink.

37:57.025 --> 38:00.018
There was a drunk man
at the bar.

38:01.905 --> 38:03.612
He bought me drinks.

38:09.913 --> 38:11.870
So stupid.

38:12.832 --> 38:14.824
They stole all my money.

38:15.126 --> 38:16.833
Beat me up.

38:17.128 --> 38:19.040
I don't know how
I got to the bus.

38:23.593 --> 38:27.212
With ten dollars
stuffed in my pocket.

38:36.439 --> 38:38.271
Do you like music?

38:40.485 --> 38:42.067
Very much.

39:14.310 --> 39:16.597
"Baby Won't You
Please Come Home."

39:16.896 --> 39:20.480
1922.

39:20.775 --> 39:22.812
One of my favorites.

39:29.033 --> 39:32.151
Do you like to dance?

39:32.453 --> 39:33.944
I don't know how.

39:35.415 --> 39:36.826
Neither do I.

41:10.969 --> 41:13.586
We interrupt this program to
bring you a special news bulletin.

41:13.888 --> 41:16.380
The Japanese have attacked
Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, by air,

41:16.683 --> 41:18.800
President Roosevelt
has just announced.

41:19.102 --> 41:21.515
The attack also was made on all
naval and military activities

41:21.813 --> 41:23.770
on the principal island of Oahu.

41:24.065 --> 41:26.307
Sophie! Sophie Beatrice!

41:26.609 --> 41:29.317
We take you now to Washington.
I'm talkin' to you.

41:29.612 --> 41:32.025
Ruth.
Why aren't you comin' to church?

41:32.323 --> 41:34.235
You come down here
and invite me in.

41:34.534 --> 41:36.901
Ruth, there's gonna
be a war. Pearl Harbor.

41:37.203 --> 41:40.287
What are you talkin' about?
What?

41:40.581 --> 41:44.245
A Japanese attack upon Pearl
Harbor naturally would mean war.

41:44.544 --> 41:47.252
Such an attack would naturally
bring a counterattack.

41:50.091 --> 41:54.256
The Navy base in Hawaii.
It was bombed.

41:54.554 --> 41:56.921
Who... Who would do that?

41:58.307 --> 42:01.800
Japanese did it.
Oh, dear Lord.

42:02.103 --> 42:06.768
Oh, oh... dear.

42:07.066 --> 42:09.729
H- How many dead?

42:10.028 --> 42:12.816
How many wounded?
They haven't said.

42:14.323 --> 42:16.315
Oh.

42:16.617 --> 42:17.733
Oh!

42:20.580 --> 42:24.574
Did... Did you kiss
that foreigner?

42:24.876 --> 42:28.586
Down by the river?
What? No.

42:28.880 --> 42:30.792
Samille's maid said you did it.

42:32.133 --> 42:35.467
No, I didn't.
I- I swear it.

42:43.478 --> 42:46.312
Pull harder, Queen Sally,
we're almost there.

42:51.652 --> 42:54.144
Row faster,
Queen Sally, row faster.

42:59.744 --> 43:01.986
Sophie Willis!

43:02.288 --> 43:06.498
You're too big to still
be playin' with them niggers.

43:06.793 --> 43:09.206
Get over here!

43:09.504 --> 43:11.666
Miss Ruth, stop!
Miss Ruth!

43:11.964 --> 43:14.001
Disgraceful to this family.
Come, John!

43:15.635 --> 43:17.501
I'm speakin' for Minna now.

43:19.180 --> 43:23.015
You stay away from that
Chinaman. You hear me, girl?

43:31.984 --> 43:34.192
Uh, the...

43:34.487 --> 43:36.319
The Japanese, they...
they bombed Pearl Harbor!

43:36.614 --> 43:39.732
What? Was a despicable sneak attack.

43:40.034 --> 43:41.866
We'll surely go to war now.

43:42.161 --> 43:45.199
People will think you're
one of them evil Japs.

43:45.498 --> 43:48.115
They won't understand that the
Chinese are different. I'm American.

43:48.417 --> 43:51.285
Well, of course, you are, but
this is a small town, Mr. Ohta.

43:51.587 --> 43:53.829
You stay close to home,
you understand?

43:54.132 --> 43:56.169
You understand me?
Yes, ma'am.

44:04.183 --> 44:09.724
Yesterday, December 7, 1941...

44:11.399 --> 44:15.063
a date which
will live in infamy...

44:17.071 --> 44:19.654
What's your name?
United States of America

44:19.949 --> 44:22.692
was suddenly
and deliberately attacked

44:22.994 --> 44:27.364
by naval and air forces
of the Empire of Japan.

44:27.665 --> 44:31.329
The attack yesterday
on the Hawaiian Islands

44:31.627 --> 44:34.415
has caused severe damage.

44:34.714 --> 44:38.924
I regret to tell you that very
many American lives had been lost.

44:40.553 --> 44:46.220
Japan has therefore undertaken
a surprise offensive

44:46.517 --> 44:49.851
extending throughout
the Pacific area.

44:50.146 --> 44:52.934
Since the unprovoked

44:53.232 --> 44:57.351
and dastardly attack by Japan,

44:57.653 --> 45:00.566
a state of war

45:00.865 --> 45:03.278
has existed

45:03.576 --> 45:07.991
between the United States
and the Japanese Empire.

46:29.161 --> 46:30.572
Ohta!

46:32.707 --> 46:34.869
Ohta! Ohta.

46:51.559 --> 46:54.893
Hey, buddy, you need a ride?
No, thank you.

46:55.187 --> 46:58.851
Where you headed?
I prefer to walk, thank you.

46:59.150 --> 47:00.391
All right, have it your way.

47:15.666 --> 47:18.283
You Miss Morrison's boy,
ain't ya?

47:18.586 --> 47:22.296
- Her gardener, yes.
- Her gardener.

47:22.590 --> 47:24.502
He's a fucking Jap.

47:51.952 --> 47:54.239
They sure made
a mess of things.

47:54.538 --> 47:58.282
Well, whoever did this
must have kidnapped Mr. Ohta.

47:58.584 --> 48:02.168
No disrespect, ma'am,
but you don't know that.

48:02.463 --> 48:06.707
My house has been vandalized.
My gardener's missing.

48:07.009 --> 48:10.798
I'm sorry about your garden, Mrs.
Morrison. I know what pride you take in it.

48:11.097 --> 48:13.089
And Mr. Ohta?

48:13.391 --> 48:15.724
Till we see evidence
of wrongdoin',

48:16.018 --> 48:18.305
it's a free country, ma'am.

48:43.629 --> 48:46.417
Who's out here? Oh, no!

48:46.715 --> 48:49.958
Oh, my. No!

48:50.261 --> 48:51.672
No!

48:53.431 --> 48:56.344
Ohta! Ohta!

48:58.436 --> 49:00.143
Oh!

49:48.819 --> 49:50.651
Shh.

49:50.946 --> 49:52.312
Shh.

49:52.615 --> 49:55.574
Mr. Ohta. Mr. Ohta.

49:55.868 --> 49:57.484
Mr. Ohta, you're okay.

49:57.786 --> 50:00.449
You're safe. You're safe.

50:02.458 --> 50:04.575
Oh, you took quite a beating.

50:06.212 --> 50:09.796
But I-I stitched you up.

50:10.090 --> 50:12.423
The wound's not too deep.

50:15.262 --> 50:17.970
When Scott was off fightin'
in the Great War,

50:18.265 --> 50:21.474
I couldn't stand
bein' home by myself.

50:21.769 --> 50:26.013
So... I finally
told my mother

50:26.315 --> 50:28.898
to go jump in a lake,

50:29.193 --> 50:33.654
and I joined Army Nurses Corps.

50:37.034 --> 50:38.946
I never made it
to the front lines, but...

50:40.371 --> 50:43.114
I got stationed
in a hospital in Texas.

50:46.835 --> 50:48.667
I'm sorry.

50:49.797 --> 50:51.129
Sorry?

50:52.633 --> 50:55.046
Sorry for what, Mr. Ohta?

51:00.140 --> 51:03.008
I'm Japanese.

51:09.149 --> 51:10.936
You lied to me?

51:13.028 --> 51:15.065
You lied?

51:16.365 --> 51:18.027
You're the enemy.

51:20.578 --> 51:21.819
American.

51:23.539 --> 51:24.950
Like you.

51:25.249 --> 51:26.990
I'm a member of the DAR!

51:28.919 --> 51:31.502
A Daughter of
the American Revolution!

51:34.633 --> 51:37.091
Not some traitor.

51:37.386 --> 51:38.627
I'm American!

52:09.251 --> 52:10.787
Thank you, Salome.

52:13.714 --> 52:15.421
Thank you.

52:15.716 --> 52:19.926
When I'm done, I'll clean up that
mess of blood you got in the foyer.

52:22.306 --> 52:24.593
He's in the study, sleeping.

52:25.976 --> 52:28.389
Folks spread filth
wherever they go.

52:29.480 --> 52:31.688
I got no stomach for it.

52:34.360 --> 52:37.194
I'm going into Brunswick

52:37.488 --> 52:38.604
to go shopping.

52:44.953 --> 52:47.741
"And the Lord said,
'Sit thou at my right hand

52:48.040 --> 52:51.454
until I make
thine enemies thy footstool.'"

52:51.752 --> 52:54.335
Why, good day, Miss Sophie.

52:54.630 --> 52:56.622
Not a good day
to be out on the water.

52:56.924 --> 52:58.131
Miss Ruth.

52:58.425 --> 53:00.382
Hello, John.

53:00.678 --> 53:02.920
I'm used to crabbin'
in all weather.

53:03.222 --> 53:08.058
Seems that the rain soaked everything
in Salty Creek except my begonias.

53:09.561 --> 53:11.644
Bye now. Bye, John.
Bye bye.

53:13.190 --> 53:16.149
"And it pleased God..."

53:20.656 --> 53:23.194
Miss Sophie is here.

53:23.492 --> 53:26.451
Give him another teaspoon of
laudanum in case he wakes up.

53:32.292 --> 53:34.955
Oh, dear Anne.

53:36.880 --> 53:40.544
Oh. Imagine a bunch of hooligans
havin' the nerve

53:40.843 --> 53:44.678
to destroy
and deface my property.

53:44.972 --> 53:48.556
If Sheriff Cooper doesn't find
out who did it, I will, by God.

53:48.851 --> 53:51.264
Even if I have to go
door to door.

53:51.562 --> 53:54.851
Mr. Ohta will help you fix it. Your
garden will be lovely again in no time.

53:56.316 --> 53:57.523
Well, he's gone.

53:59.611 --> 54:00.522
What?

54:03.323 --> 54:05.360
Tea?

54:05.659 --> 54:08.493
I just made some, uh,
lemon walnut bread.

54:08.787 --> 54:10.779
It's fresh out the oven.
I'll get some.

54:22.342 --> 54:26.677
After what they did to the garden,
he knew it was time to move on.

54:26.972 --> 54:31.683
I dropped him at the bus depot
in Brunswick before dawn.

54:31.977 --> 54:35.345
He is on his way home
to Canada now. Canada?

54:36.607 --> 54:37.848
That's where his family is.

54:40.110 --> 54:43.603
- Oh, I thought it was California.
- Where'd you hear that?

54:46.992 --> 54:49.826
I don't know. I thought I heard
him mention it. I must be wrong.

54:52.539 --> 54:55.407
Miss Sophie brought you
some nice fresh-caught crab.

54:55.709 --> 54:59.828
Well, thank you, dear. I'll dig
out my crab cake recipe for Salome.

55:00.714 --> 55:03.297
Recipe?

55:09.681 --> 55:11.593
So sorry
about your garden, Anne.

55:14.394 --> 55:17.683
Forgive me, Sophie,
but I... hadn't rested well.

55:17.981 --> 55:20.724
Oh, of course.

55:29.201 --> 55:30.908
I do appreciate you.

55:37.835 --> 55:38.951
Sophie.

55:45.884 --> 55:48.922
Spread the word. He's gone.

56:45.986 --> 56:47.978
Please, wait.

56:50.866 --> 56:52.482
We have to hurry.

57:11.762 --> 57:12.548
Hold that.

57:13.722 --> 57:14.838
Okay.

57:16.224 --> 57:17.340
Easy.

57:19.895 --> 57:21.352
Okay, here.

57:24.399 --> 57:25.856
Put your hand on here.

57:26.151 --> 57:27.983
Okay. Careful.

57:46.254 --> 57:48.291
I told you
it was gonna be fun.

57:50.509 --> 57:52.421
Well, there's Anne.

57:52.719 --> 57:55.086
Anne? Anne!

58:46.273 --> 58:48.435
This is Poppa's
old fishing cabin.

58:49.985 --> 58:54.070
As you can see...
it hadn't been used in years.

58:57.909 --> 59:00.117
Tried to tidy up a bit.

59:00.412 --> 59:02.699
Forgive me for causing
so much trouble.

59:02.998 --> 59:04.830
As soon as I can,
I will leave.

59:05.125 --> 59:07.617
No use tryin'
till your wound's healed.

59:07.919 --> 59:09.535
I'll come once a week
and bring new supplies.

59:09.838 --> 59:11.750
Thank you, Miss Anne.

59:13.842 --> 59:15.834
Thank you for my garden.

59:16.136 --> 59:19.470
I would fix it, if I could.

59:20.807 --> 59:22.890
Gardens are never finished,
Mr. Ohta.

59:23.185 --> 59:25.302
You know that.

59:25.604 --> 59:27.971
From season to season,
they're meant to change.

59:28.273 --> 59:29.889
Wait.

59:36.073 --> 59:38.486
Please, mail this for me.

59:54.674 --> 59:57.337
Mornin', Miss Anne.
Here, let me help you with that.

01:00:01.348 --> 01:00:04.011
Guess it's just you and me,
Salome.

01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:05.595
Mr. Ohta's gone.

01:00:06.645 --> 01:00:08.511
Gone? Where?

01:00:08.814 --> 01:00:10.430
I gave truth to my lie.

01:00:10.732 --> 01:00:14.976
Um, I took him to Brunswick and
put him on a bus home... to Canada.

01:00:15.278 --> 01:00:17.486
That man
wasn't fit to travel.

01:00:17.781 --> 01:00:19.192
He couldn't stay here,
could he?

01:00:26.998 --> 01:00:30.412
Well, what in God's name is ocher skin?
Somebody tell me that.

01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:32.121
Well, she was just kissin' him.

01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:35.913
But it was who she was kissin'.
Ladies, f-forgive my tardiness.

01:00:36.216 --> 01:00:38.003
You better be glad
your Chinaman's gone,

01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:40.964
'cause otherwise somebody
would be callin' him a Jap.

01:00:41.263 --> 01:00:43.801
- No question if you go by this.
- What are you talkin' about?

01:00:44.099 --> 01:00:44.839
Look.

01:00:50.814 --> 01:00:52.100
That's despicable.

01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:54.982
Do you know where he's gone?

01:00:56.778 --> 01:01:00.397
- Canada.
- Canada? I thought he lived in California.

01:01:00.699 --> 01:01:05.160
- Who told you that?
- Well, I heard that he sent a letter home to California.

01:01:05.453 --> 01:01:07.490
Yes, well,
his family is in Canada.

01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:10.406
And you sound sorry
that he's gone.

01:01:10.709 --> 01:01:13.122
Damn right, Ruth Jeffers!

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:17.039
I
- I mean, he's the best gardener I ever met. Even better'n Scott.

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:20.128
Well, gardenin'
isn't his only interest.

01:01:20.427 --> 01:01:22.510
Our little Sophie.

01:01:22.804 --> 01:01:24.545
What on earth
are you talkin' about?

01:01:24.848 --> 01:01:28.717
Sophie hasn't been to church
in two months.

01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:32.012
Yeah, did you know that? Was she
supposed to be down by the river painting?

01:01:32.314 --> 01:01:35.273
Well, there was a little more to it
than that. Our Sophie has gone wild.

01:01:35.567 --> 01:01:37.854
Crazy to take up
with a yellow man.

01:01:38.153 --> 01:01:40.816
I would say for certain
that he is a Jap.

01:01:41.114 --> 01:01:43.481
What on earth does all this
have to do with Sophie Willis?

01:01:43.783 --> 01:01:46.196
Anne, she's done it before.

01:01:46.494 --> 01:01:49.737
Sophie... been friendly
with coloreds.

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:51.656
You stop talkin' trash
about that girl!

01:01:51.958 --> 01:01:54.245
That girl?
That girl is a grown woman!

01:02:04.346 --> 01:02:07.384
Oh!

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:17.056
Oh. Oh, God.

01:02:18.151 --> 01:02:21.360
Oh, no. Oh, no.

01:02:21.655 --> 01:02:23.647
No!

01:02:23.949 --> 01:02:25.941
Oh!
Your ankle's broke.

01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:30.908
Doctor says you gon' be
laid up for some time.

01:02:31.206 --> 01:02:34.199
Where's Dr. Gilbert,
the quack?

01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:38.962
He's gone. You been out a
long time with that morphine.

01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:42.499
I need some water.
Water, please.

01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:54.181
Doctor said you gon' need
someone to stay with you

01:02:54.479 --> 01:02:56.436
for at least a month or two
till that ankle heals.

01:02:56.731 --> 01:02:58.438
Oh, I won't have it.

01:02:58.733 --> 01:03:00.315
I told him I'd stay.

01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:06.113
Don't you have family
expecting you for Christmas?

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:08.441
No, ma'am.

01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:12.532
Doctor said a woman your age,

01:03:12.831 --> 01:03:14.618
you're lucky
you didn't break somethin' else.

01:03:14.916 --> 01:03:17.283
Just get away from me.

01:03:17.585 --> 01:03:19.668
Let me rest.

01:03:19.963 --> 01:03:21.670
I need rest.

01:04:03.631 --> 01:04:05.623
They're singing for you,
Miss Anne.

01:04:05.925 --> 01:04:07.917
Yes.

01:04:08.219 --> 01:04:10.211
Want me help you
to the window?

01:04:10.513 --> 01:04:12.425
No, thank you.

01:04:12.724 --> 01:04:15.558
It's more than I can bear.

01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:39.800
Evenin', Miss Sophie.

01:05:42.272 --> 01:05:44.605
Did I not hear you knock?

01:05:48.736 --> 01:05:52.195
It's amazing this place
hasn't fallen down around you.

01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:54.231
What is it, Sheriff Cooper?

01:05:56.619 --> 01:06:00.283
Your mama didn't teach you
much about housekeepin'.

01:06:00.582 --> 01:06:03.165
No, she had greater
aspirations for me.

01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:07.787
Miss Anne says that...

01:06:08.089 --> 01:06:10.923
yellow Jap bastard
went home to wherever.

01:06:11.217 --> 01:06:14.210
But ain't nobody
seen him leave.

01:06:14.512 --> 01:06:16.595
Well, I certainly did not.

01:06:18.766 --> 01:06:20.974
Find that hard to believe

01:06:21.269 --> 01:06:24.182
since you two were so... close.

01:06:24.481 --> 01:06:26.268
I've wondered the same thing
myself, Sheriff.

01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:30.559
It occurs to me...

01:06:32.864 --> 01:06:35.481
maybe he's hidin'
in plain sight.

01:06:35.783 --> 01:06:38.992
Well, please,
search anywhere you'd like.

01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:43.744
Thank you, ma'am.
I intend to.

01:08:13.256 --> 01:08:14.997
Did that Jap
sleep there with ya?

01:08:16.259 --> 01:08:18.626
Of course not.

01:08:22.015 --> 01:08:24.176
Oh!

01:08:27.228 --> 01:08:29.515
No, no, no, no!

01:08:33.401 --> 01:08:36.439
No, no!

01:08:38.031 --> 01:08:39.442
Pretty strong for an old biddy.

01:09:01.345 --> 01:09:03.337
I guess he's not here, is he?

01:09:14.692 --> 01:09:16.228
Good night, Miss Sophie.

01:09:56.859 --> 01:09:59.772
Oh, Salome! How's Anne?
I been worried sick.

01:10:00.071 --> 01:10:02.484
She'll mend.

01:10:02.782 --> 01:10:05.115
She wanted to make sure
you had a nice Christmas dinner.

01:10:10.123 --> 01:10:11.785
Oh, my goodness.

01:10:16.546 --> 01:10:19.880
There's enough food
in here for a week.

01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:55.032
- Anne, look what you've done.
- - Mm.

01:10:55.334 --> 01:10:58.827
I'm so glad you sent for me. You
still have lilies in your garden?

01:10:59.130 --> 01:11:01.964
They're a little brown and withered,
but I thought you might enjoy 'em.

01:11:02.258 --> 01:11:03.840
I'll put 'em in the vase.

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:07.552
The blue vase.

01:11:12.685 --> 01:11:14.722
And, Salome,
please close the door.

01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:26.614
Forgive me, Sophie, but you
look more tired than I do.

01:11:26.908 --> 01:11:29.651
I haven't been sleepin' well.

01:11:29.952 --> 01:11:32.114
Oh, don't pay any attention
to Ruth Jeffers.

01:11:32.413 --> 01:11:35.201
Ruth?
I thought you knew.

01:11:36.626 --> 01:11:38.242
About you and Mr. Ohta.

01:11:42.298 --> 01:11:45.757
Have you been paintin' together
by the river on Sunday mornin's?

01:11:47.345 --> 01:11:49.962
We did paint together,
but it was purely innocent.

01:11:51.557 --> 01:11:54.641
People always think the worst.

01:11:54.936 --> 01:11:56.393
I'm a grown woman, Anne.
Of course you are.

01:11:56.687 --> 01:11:57.723
And you're a lady.

01:12:01.984 --> 01:12:04.442
She's a filthy-minded...

01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:15.579
Get off of me!
Get off of me!

01:12:19.377 --> 01:12:22.870
How dare you disobey your
mother? Stop, Mama! Stop!

01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:25.505
How dare you!
Mama, stop!

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:28.838
Layin'... Layin'
with that nigga!

01:12:29.136 --> 01:12:31.469
She's a good girl!
She's my best friend! Stop!

01:12:37.854 --> 01:12:39.516
Come back here!

01:12:39.814 --> 01:12:42.648
You come back here!

01:12:42.942 --> 01:12:46.526
You! How dare you
show up here?

01:12:46.821 --> 01:12:49.279
You never come near her again!
You hear me?

01:12:59.542 --> 01:13:00.623
Forgive me, Anne.

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:05.963
Never mind, Sophie.

01:13:06.257 --> 01:13:08.169
The war's got us all on edge.

01:13:10.303 --> 01:13:13.387
Sophie, I need your help.
Anything, Anne.

01:13:15.975 --> 01:13:17.637
It's Mr. Ohta.

01:13:22.481 --> 01:13:24.518
He didn't leave.

01:13:27.987 --> 01:13:29.319
Where is he?

01:13:32.074 --> 01:13:36.535
He's... He's hidin'
in Poppa's old fishin' cabin.

01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:19.028
He has suffered so much,
Heavenly Father.

01:14:19.330 --> 01:14:20.912
I'm asking this...

01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:25.371
Who on earth?

01:14:28.631 --> 01:14:29.747
Oh!

01:14:34.637 --> 01:14:37.550
Yes, John? It's okay.

01:14:37.848 --> 01:14:39.339
It's okay, honey.

01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:52.277
Grover?

01:14:53.614 --> 01:14:55.571
Grover?

01:14:58.536 --> 01:14:59.697
Sophie.

01:15:09.839 --> 01:15:11.580
Where is Miss Anne?

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:18.136
She fell and broke her ankle.
Salome is taking care of her.

01:15:18.431 --> 01:15:19.717
She'll be all right.

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:30.982
I've brought you more supplies.

01:15:34.113 --> 01:15:35.604
Thank you.

01:17:00.616 --> 01:17:01.948
My boots.

01:18:22.573 --> 01:18:24.940
You're lookin'
much better, Anne.

01:18:25.242 --> 01:18:27.074
Oh, that's very kind, Ruth.

01:18:27.369 --> 01:18:29.361
I know how much you like
my potato salad,

01:18:29.663 --> 01:18:31.529
so I made enough
to stuff you to the gills.

01:18:31.832 --> 01:18:34.575
If I end up a bigger lump o'
lard at the end of this adventure,

01:18:34.877 --> 01:18:37.494
I will blame you,
Samille Gilbert.

01:18:37.796 --> 01:18:41.585
Well, Isabel made you a pecan
pie. I know that's your favorite.

01:18:41.884 --> 01:18:44.592
Oh, whatever would I do
without such friends?

01:18:44.887 --> 01:18:49.302
It's important to remember... we can
rely on each other in times of need.

01:18:50.643 --> 01:18:52.430
Good mornin', Anne.
How are you today?

01:18:52.728 --> 01:18:55.436
Thank you for comin', Sophie.

01:18:55.731 --> 01:18:57.267
I brought you
some black-eyed peas.

01:18:58.442 --> 01:19:00.684
Miss Ruth. Miss Samille.

01:19:00.986 --> 01:19:06.152
I see you've joined the others in...
conspiring to fatten me up for the slaughter.

01:19:06.450 --> 01:19:08.817
You're lookin' rested
today, Sophie.

01:19:09.119 --> 01:19:12.829
The Lord's forgiveness
beautifies the body and the soul.

01:19:13.123 --> 01:19:14.830
Yes, it does, Miss Ruth.

01:19:16.377 --> 01:19:20.121
Well, Samille,
it's time for us to go.

01:19:20.422 --> 01:19:23.836
Poor Betsy Larkin,
she is down with a fever.

01:19:24.134 --> 01:19:27.844
We promised her a visit
today also.

01:19:31.016 --> 01:19:33.133
Would you like
to join us, Sophie?

01:19:33.435 --> 01:19:36.223
I'm goin' keep Sophie
to myself for a while.

01:19:36.522 --> 01:19:38.354
Did you bring the cards?

01:19:38.649 --> 01:19:41.517
Anne has challenged me
to a gin rummy tournament.

01:19:41.819 --> 01:19:44.402
Well, you know
what I think about cards.

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:48.197
I do indeed, Ruth.

01:19:59.086 --> 01:20:02.045
Oh, is he all right?
Yes. He's fine.

01:20:02.339 --> 01:20:04.547
Well, he's fine.

01:21:38.435 --> 01:21:40.677
Sophie.
Hmm?

01:21:42.773 --> 01:21:45.015
I have to find a way to leave.

01:21:46.068 --> 01:21:49.152
No.

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:53.698
No, you can't leave.

01:21:53.992 --> 01:21:58.032
I don't want anything
to happen to you or Miss Anne.

01:22:47.379 --> 01:22:51.089
That was Sophie.
And she is up to something.

01:22:51.383 --> 01:22:54.091
And I'm gonna see what it is.

01:22:54.386 --> 01:22:56.594
Kendall's gonna be here with
you, darlin', and take care of ya.

01:22:56.889 --> 01:22:58.221
I'll be right back.

01:25:15.152 --> 01:25:18.486
Who's usin' your poppa's old
fishin' cabin down by the river?

01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:21.488
- Who let her in?
- She just barged in.

01:25:21.783 --> 01:25:24.446
- What?
- What are you talkin' 'bout, Ruth?

01:25:24.745 --> 01:25:27.783
Crab shells.
Biscuits.

01:25:28.081 --> 01:25:30.198
And sheets on the bed.

01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:33.208
And the strangest paintin'
I have ever seen.

01:25:33.503 --> 01:25:35.745
Did you see anyone?
It's a picture of Sophie.

01:25:36.965 --> 01:25:39.548
And some giant egret.

01:25:39.843 --> 01:25:43.712
I've seen her. I've seen
her walkin' past my house

01:25:44.014 --> 01:25:46.176
in the middle of the night.

01:25:46.475 --> 01:25:50.469
And comin' back at dawn.
So don't you lie to me.

01:25:50.771 --> 01:25:52.683
I told Sophie she could use
Poppa's cabin.

01:25:52.981 --> 01:25:56.099
- You know about it?
- 'Course I know.

01:25:58.904 --> 01:26:00.145
You tell that uppity girl
to leave.

01:26:09.539 --> 01:26:12.907
I told Sophie she could use Poppa's
cabin whenever she wanted to.

01:26:13.210 --> 01:26:14.371
For what?

01:26:15.379 --> 01:26:18.338
Painting! What do you think?

01:26:18.632 --> 01:26:20.669
Are you hidin'
that Jap down there?

01:26:20.967 --> 01:26:24.881
Did you see him? No! Ruth, we
have known each other a long time,

01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:27.672
and I'm tellin' you to stop
this gossip about Sophie.

01:26:27.974 --> 01:26:31.058
And this cock-and-bull story that
you have cooked up about Mr. Ohta.

01:26:37.734 --> 01:26:41.227
Well, Minna
was my best friend.

01:26:41.530 --> 01:26:45.865
And I-I owe it to her
to protect her child.

01:26:46.159 --> 01:26:47.695
Even from
her own wicked ways.

01:26:47.994 --> 01:26:51.738
Whatever you made up in your dirty
little mind, you will stop right now.

01:26:53.709 --> 01:26:58.704
Sophie is an honorable woman,
and Mr. Ohta is gone.

01:26:59.005 --> 01:27:00.746
You are not to go
to Poppa's cabin again.

01:27:01.049 --> 01:27:05.089
A- Are you threatenin' me,
Anne Morrison?

01:27:05.387 --> 01:27:09.677
Ruth, you remember,
I know all about your daddy.

01:27:09.975 --> 01:27:13.559
No laughin' out loud on Sundays.
No dancin', no card playin'.

01:27:13.854 --> 01:27:15.766
My daddy
was a-a man o' God.

01:27:16.064 --> 01:27:19.899
Except when he went down to my
poppa's cabin with a stash o' liquor,

01:27:20.193 --> 01:27:22.685
sometimes for days on end.

01:27:22.988 --> 01:27:26.652
Oh, and he liked to bring colored
women with him too, didn't he?

01:27:29.870 --> 01:27:31.327
Didn't he?

01:27:34.916 --> 01:27:37.408
Jesus said,

01:27:37.711 --> 01:27:42.581
"It's not the healthy that
need the doctor, but the sick.

01:27:42.883 --> 01:27:46.467
I have not come to
call the righteous,

01:27:46.762 --> 01:27:49.004
but the sinners." Luke.

01:27:50.974 --> 01:27:54.183
My poppa pitied your daddy.

01:27:54.478 --> 01:27:56.435
And, Ruth, I'm tellin' you,

01:27:56.730 --> 01:28:00.849
I will print it on the front
page of theBrunswick Chronicle.

01:28:04.821 --> 01:28:06.232
Salome.

01:28:07.157 --> 01:28:08.864
Uh, come here.

01:28:12.370 --> 01:28:14.487
Please take this
to Sophie right now.

01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:16.497
It's very important.

01:28:24.674 --> 01:28:26.586
The doctor told me
to take care o' you.

01:28:26.885 --> 01:28:28.922
And that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

01:28:29.221 --> 01:28:32.840
So why don't you just tell me
what the hell is goin' on?

01:28:47.823 --> 01:28:51.612
Salome, what are you doin' here?
Is... Is Anne all right?

01:28:54.204 --> 01:28:57.322
Yeah, she's fine, Miss Sophie.
She's fine.

01:29:09.261 --> 01:29:12.095
Well...

01:29:14.599 --> 01:29:16.431
My Queen Sally.

01:29:23.191 --> 01:29:25.228
How could I not know you?

01:29:25.527 --> 01:29:30.272
Well, life has worn some
unexpected lines into my face.

01:29:37.330 --> 01:29:39.287
I never knew
your name was Salome.

01:29:42.752 --> 01:29:47.588
Queen Sally took me a ways, but
it got hard to keep her goin'.

01:29:47.883 --> 01:29:50.000
Salome is what's left.

01:29:51.845 --> 01:29:53.461
Where did you go?

01:29:56.683 --> 01:29:59.016
I traveled around some.

01:29:59.311 --> 01:30:01.394
All over the South.

01:30:01.688 --> 01:30:05.147
I was a singer with a big band.

01:30:05.442 --> 01:30:07.479
Almost made it
to Hollywood once.

01:30:10.947 --> 01:30:12.734
And did you have a daughter?

01:30:15.118 --> 01:30:18.156
My girl was
to be named Emmeline.

01:30:18.455 --> 01:30:20.071
And yours
would be Katherine.

01:30:21.124 --> 01:30:22.911
Uh-huh. Katherine Sophie.

01:30:23.209 --> 01:30:24.871
Oh.

01:30:25.170 --> 01:30:28.663
She died... when she was three.

01:30:29.549 --> 01:30:30.835
Whoopin' cough.

01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:36.053
I'm so sorry, Salome.

01:30:36.348 --> 01:30:38.180
I'm so sorry.
Yeah, well...

01:30:40.101 --> 01:30:43.014
Oh, almost everyone is gone now.

01:31:10.423 --> 01:31:14.258
My goodness,
my goodness, you...

01:31:14.552 --> 01:31:16.885
Sophie, you are
in a whole lotta trouble.

01:31:18.306 --> 01:31:19.717
Why?

01:31:20.934 --> 01:31:25.019
That darn Ruth Jeffers.

01:31:25.313 --> 01:31:29.273
She know all about you goin'
down to Miss Anne's fishin' cabin.

01:31:30.652 --> 01:31:32.769
Does she know why?

01:31:33.071 --> 01:31:35.313
No, she don't know nothin'.
Miss Anne made sure o' that.

01:31:35.615 --> 01:31:37.072
Do you know?

01:31:38.201 --> 01:31:39.408
Yeah.

01:31:52.549 --> 01:31:54.711
And now that I seen your face,

01:31:55.010 --> 01:31:57.093
I know a whole lot more'n
Miss Anne knows.

01:31:59.264 --> 01:32:01.972
He's leavin', so just leave him.
I don't want him to be hurt.

01:32:08.481 --> 01:32:10.143
You just gon' let him go?

01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:14.318
"There is in the channel,
or a few inches more,

01:32:14.612 --> 01:32:16.899
as was often the case
in the old times,

01:32:17.198 --> 01:32:21.067
one must be painfully
circumspect in his polity.

01:32:21.369 --> 01:32:22.405
We... "

01:32:23.997 --> 01:32:25.659
"We used to have to sound..."

01:32:36.718 --> 01:32:38.880
Mister! Hey, mister!

01:32:43.099 --> 01:32:46.308
It's okay.
Salome Whitmore sent me.

01:33:20.595 --> 01:33:23.008
You all right?
Yeah.

01:33:51.167 --> 01:33:53.079
Anne!

01:33:53.378 --> 01:33:56.212
I knew it! I knew it!

01:34:50.810 --> 01:34:52.096
Sophie.

01:34:53.479 --> 01:34:54.811
I'm coming with you.

01:34:55.106 --> 01:34:57.814
You can't. It's dangerous.

01:34:59.110 --> 01:35:00.772
Well, you can't leave
without me.

01:35:12.081 --> 01:35:16.576
Mr. Ohta, this here
is a bill o' sale for the car.

01:35:16.878 --> 01:35:18.369
Miss Anne
sent you some money.

01:35:20.882 --> 01:35:22.373
Take it now.

01:35:27.096 --> 01:35:29.884
Thank you so much, Miss Salome.

01:35:30.183 --> 01:35:31.674
Please, tell Miss Anne.

01:35:43.112 --> 01:35:44.944
I love you, Queen Sally.

01:36:14.519 --> 01:36:16.351
No, no, no, no, no.

01:36:18.273 --> 01:36:20.356
You get outta that car!

01:36:20.650 --> 01:36:23.313
What are you doin'? You crazy!

01:36:25.113 --> 01:36:26.024
Ow!

01:36:38.584 --> 01:36:40.871
Ah!

01:36:53.641 --> 01:36:55.223
They're gone.

01:36:56.811 --> 01:36:58.894
They're gone!

01:37:47.278 --> 01:37:50.112
- What you doin' down here?
- Don't you scold me.

01:37:51.574 --> 01:37:53.065
What happened?

01:37:56.704 --> 01:37:58.286
They made it.

01:37:58.581 --> 01:37:59.788
Who?

01:38:05.588 --> 01:38:07.204
Mr. Ohta...

01:38:11.010 --> 01:38:12.876
and Sophie.

01:38:18.101 --> 01:38:21.219
Oh!

01:38:21.521 --> 01:38:24.514
You're hurt.
Now you come inside.

01:38:30.488 --> 01:38:32.571
I'll make us a cup o' tea.
