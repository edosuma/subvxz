Elizabeth's sister.

00:04.505 --> 00:06.605
Now, I've done my own inquiry
into this mine explosion...

00:06.607 --> 00:08.507
-And I may need some help.
-Anything.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.342
[julie]:
I found him in the forest.

00:10.344 --> 00:12.044
You have to admit
something doesn't seem right

00:12.046 --> 00:13.545
You have new orders?

00:13.547 --> 00:15.047
I am so sorry.

00:15.049 --> 00:16.448
I might
never see him again.

Jack didn't leave you.

00:29.530 --> 00:32.264
He left to pursue his dream.

00:32.266 --> 00:34.633
He wants to save lives
and round up bad guys

00:34.635 --> 00:37.136
And keep the world safe.

00:37.138 --> 00:38.704
It's noble work,

00:38.706 --> 00:40.773
And I, for one,
am proud to know him.

00:40.775 --> 00:43.509
If it's meant to be,
he'll come back to us.

00:43.511 --> 00:46.078
If he survives
and doesn't meet anyone else.

Can I ask you

01:15.743 --> 01:17.810
Which direction
you're coming from?

01:17.812 --> 01:20.179
Uh, west of here.
Coal valley.

01:20.181 --> 01:22.414
We're looking
for a group of outlaws,

01:22.416 --> 01:25.284
Robbed a series of banks

01:25.286 --> 01:26.652
-Ah. The tolliver gang.
-Yeah.

01:26.654 --> 01:28.720
I've heard of 'em.
Never crossed paths, though.

01:28.722 --> 01:30.222
Where are you headed?

01:30.224 --> 01:33.525
I'm being reassigned,
heading to my new post.

01:33.527 --> 01:36.462
May be joining you
on the tolliver pursuit

01:36.464 --> 01:38.163
Before long.

01:38.165 --> 01:40.732
You any relation
to thomas thornton?

01:41.701 --> 01:44.369
Yeah. I'm his son, jack.

01:44.371 --> 01:45.604
Yeah, I saw the resemblance.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.539
I was with him
in the old days.

01:48.741 --> 01:52.177
What direction
was the gang headed?

01:52.179 --> 01:53.345
I'm not sure.

01:53.347 --> 01:56.381
We got units spread out
in all directions.

01:56.383 --> 01:57.783
For all we know,
tolliver could be dead.

01:57.785 --> 02:00.285
Security guard
from the last bank they hit

02:00.287 --> 02:01.753
Thinks he may have
winged him.

02:01.755 --> 02:02.821
Yeah, well, if he didn't,

02:02.823 --> 02:05.457
Tolliver's nowhere near here.

02:07.227 --> 02:09.294

Oh! You're up.

02:22.376 --> 02:26.311
I'm going to clean you up
and make you presentable.

02:28.314 --> 02:30.716
Well, I've seen my father shave,

02:30.718 --> 02:33.452
And I've seen
people cut hair.

02:33.454 --> 02:36.288
How hard can it be?

02:38.758 --> 02:40.526
Okay.

02:40.528 --> 02:41.793
Clean me up.

02:41.795 --> 02:43.629
I'll look like
a real gentleman for you.

02:55.241 --> 02:57.376
Everyone deserves
a fresh start.

02:57.378 --> 02:58.377
Mm.

your kindness?

03:10.591 --> 03:12.724
By turning your life around.

03:14.961 --> 03:18.330
By becoming the man
you were meant to be.

03:19.332 --> 03:21.266
That is my intention.

03:22.435 --> 03:25.370
With your encouragement,
I will be that man.

03:35.315 --> 03:37.482
Don't worry.

03:37.484 --> 03:40.352
I trust you.

03:44.657 --> 03:46.792
[razor scraping]

03:51.664 --> 03:52.798
It's one thing
to not meet up

03:52.800 --> 03:54.266
At the meet spot...

03:55.435 --> 03:57.636
Maybe the mounties
got him.

03:57.638 --> 03:59.271
No. Not nate.

03:59.273 --> 04:00.472
He'd never
let 'em take him alive.

04:00.474 --> 04:02.274

04:05.379 --> 04:06.645
And people are gonna start dyin'

04:06.647 --> 04:08.247

out of my share.

04:12.685 --> 04:15.420
[♪]

04:22.795 --> 04:24.496
Boys and girls,

04:24.498 --> 04:27.566
Today, we're going to learn
about inertia.

04:27.568 --> 04:30.335
"inertia" is the stubbornness
of a physical object

04:30.337 --> 04:32.904
To change its motion.

04:32.906 --> 04:35.007
All right.
Here I have two eggs.

04:35.009 --> 04:37.843
One is fresh
and the other is hard-boiled.

04:42.982 --> 04:44.716
Why do you think
one egg stopped

04:44.718 --> 04:46.385
And the other one
is still spinning.

04:48.688 --> 04:50.389
Magic.

04:50.391 --> 04:52.357
Actually, emily,
it isn't magic,

04:52.359 --> 04:53.525
But sometimes,

04:53.527 --> 04:55.360
Science can be so wonderful
and amazing,

04:55.362 --> 04:57.329
That it feels like magic.

04:57.331 --> 04:59.031
The reason why one egg
is stopped

04:59.033 --> 05:00.666
And the other one
is still spinning

05:00.668 --> 05:03.001
Is that the fresh egg
is still liquid inside,

05:03.003 --> 05:04.803
And the liquid keeps moving

05:04.805 --> 05:07.439
Because of
"the law of inertia."

05:07.441 --> 05:11.009
An object in motion
tends to stay in motion,

05:11.011 --> 05:13.045
And an object at rest
usually stays at rest.

05:13.047 --> 05:15.414
I think rip
is an object at rest.

Oh, he's out

Don't know when

I can take that
for you, ma'am.

Well, I would like to leave it
directly on his desk,

06:54.882 --> 06:56.014
If you don't mind.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.949
It's our agreement,

06:57.951 --> 07:00.085
And I would also like to
leave him some muffins

To help our friend

Nathaniel.

09:15.122 --> 09:16.955
Well, I appreciate
the offer,

09:16.957 --> 09:19.324
But I'll be on my way as soon as
I'm strong enough to ride.

09:19.326 --> 09:20.992
How's that injury of yours?

09:20.994 --> 09:22.160
Almost healed.

Gunshot wound,

How'd that happen?

09:27.968 --> 09:31.870
Trackin' a large buck
through some very thick brush.

09:31.872 --> 09:34.072
My friend was tracking him
from a distance, too.

09:34.074 --> 09:37.342
Must've shot at the buck
and grazed me instead.

09:37.344 --> 09:39.244
I blacked out,
and when I came to,

09:39.246 --> 09:40.946
This pretty lady was there,
like an angel.

09:40.948 --> 09:42.948

09:42.950 --> 09:45.750
Your friend
just left you there?

09:45.752 --> 09:48.019
Don't think
he realizes I got injured.

Where's home?

09:50.023 --> 09:51.957
About 20 miles south.
Falls creek.

09:51.959 --> 09:53.892
A little lumber town.
My people are in logging.

09:53.894 --> 09:54.993
Well, you let me know

09:54.995 --> 09:57.095
If there's anything
I can do to help.

10:39.773 --> 10:42.273
We both know
that's not true,

10:42.275 --> 10:43.908
But you did
the right thing

10:43.910 --> 10:46.745
By telling him
to follow his dream.

10:46.747 --> 10:48.179
I know you're right.

10:48.181 --> 10:50.015
It just feels...

10:50.017 --> 10:51.950
I know.

10:55.354 --> 10:57.055
I'm concerned
about that young man

10:57.057 --> 10:59.257
Your sister
found in the woods.

10:59.259 --> 11:00.925
I'm worried, too.

11:00.927 --> 11:02.994
She knows nothing
about him,

11:02.996 --> 11:05.797
But she's taken
such a personal interest.

11:05.799 --> 11:08.266
I asked
constable o'reilly

11:08.268 --> 11:10.268
To pay him a visit.

11:10.270 --> 11:12.003
Is the constable worried
that he's dangerous?

11:12.005 --> 11:13.371
Oh, I'm not
saying that.

11:13.373 --> 11:16.875
I just want to send
a message loud and clear

11:16.877 --> 11:17.976
That we intend
to keep our town

11:17.978 --> 11:19.944
Safe and secure.

11:21.113 --> 11:23.314
I'm afraid
julie sees all of life

11:23.316 --> 11:24.983
As a romance novel,

11:24.985 --> 11:27.252
With her cast
as the heroine.

11:27.254 --> 11:29.721
She's young.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.156
She'll learn.

11:31.158 --> 11:32.857
Perfect!

11:32.859 --> 11:35.226
Neat and tidy,
just the way I like it.

Now people will know
what we sell here.

Good afternoon, constable! How's
coal valley treating you?

11:40.434 --> 11:42.100
I need to send a telegram.

11:42.102 --> 11:45.103

Oh, good afternoon,
mr. Gowen.

12:03.090 --> 12:06.357
And thank you
for your delivery this morning.

12:06.359 --> 12:07.992
Oh, you're welcome.

12:07.994 --> 12:09.160
You, uh,

12:09.162 --> 12:10.428
You brought pastries,

12:10.430 --> 12:12.330
And I had to ask myself why.

12:14.166 --> 12:16.267
I was just
being neighborly.

12:16.269 --> 12:18.870
You sure
that's all it is?

12:18.872 --> 12:21.005
I can't think of
another reason.

12:21.007 --> 12:23.074
Perhaps you were
hoping to see me.

12:25.010 --> 12:26.845
As I've said before,
mr. Gowen,

12:26.847 --> 12:28.947
If you're trying to be
flirtatious with me,

12:28.949 --> 12:32.016
It is neither welcomed,
nor appreciated.

12:32.018 --> 12:34.152
I guess you're right.

12:34.154 --> 12:36.387
We are
simply business partners.

12:36.389 --> 12:41.960
But perhaps, over time,
we could become friends.

12:41.962 --> 12:44.462
I doubt it...

12:44.464 --> 12:47.031
But there's certainly no reason
we can't be civil.

12:48.300 --> 12:50.034
Mr. Richardson,

12:50.036 --> 12:53.004
How long was mrs. Stanton alone
in my office this morning?

12:53.006 --> 12:55.907
About five minutes, sir.

12:55.909 --> 12:58.376
Your being "civil,"
does that include

12:58.378 --> 13:00.111
Stealing the file
from my office

13:00.113 --> 13:02.881
That you have hidden
underneath your red tablecloth?

13:04.917 --> 13:06.785
I know what you did.

13:06.787 --> 13:10.155
That file is my property
and I'll be needing it back.

13:10.157 --> 13:12.791
You murdered my son
and my husband.

13:12.793 --> 13:15.360
You murdered
half the men in this town.

13:15.362 --> 13:19.097
Mr. Richardson, would you please
wait for me outside?

13:19.099 --> 13:21.166
Yes, sir.

13:23.469 --> 13:26.037
[door opens and shuts]

13:27.273 --> 13:29.374
Those papers prove nothing.

13:29.376 --> 13:31.075
It's evidence.

13:31.077 --> 13:32.143
Evidence of what?

13:32.145 --> 13:33.812
Men died on your watch.

13:33.814 --> 13:37.015
It proves you could have
done more to keep them safe.

13:37.017 --> 13:38.283
Let me give you

13:38.285 --> 13:40.919
A little something to gnaw on,
mrs. Stanton.

13:41.921 --> 13:43.588
Your husband,

13:43.590 --> 13:47.225
Who you so cavalierly accuse me
of killing,

13:47.227 --> 13:49.561
Was my right-hand man.

13:49.563 --> 13:52.463
He was in charge
of operations in the mine,

13:52.465 --> 13:54.199
So if corners were cut,

13:54.201 --> 13:56.935
Or safety measures
were not met,

13:56.937 --> 13:59.304
How do you know

13:59.306 --> 14:02.207
That he was not responsible
for that?

14:05.377 --> 14:07.579
How do you know

14:07.581 --> 14:10.081
That he was not responsible

14:10.083 --> 14:12.083
For the death of your son?

14:12.085 --> 14:14.953
For all
of the deaths?

14:14.955 --> 14:18.389
Do you want that
out in the open?

14:18.391 --> 14:22.026
Do you want
the whole town to know?

14:24.330 --> 14:26.865
What happens then?

14:28.968 --> 14:31.936
Good afternoon, mrs. Stanton.

14:35.441 --> 14:37.976
[♪]

15:01.367 --> 15:02.467
Morning, mounties.

15:02.469 --> 15:04.602
Morning, constable.

15:04.604 --> 15:07.238
You, uh, one of the units
after the tolliver gang?

15:07.240 --> 15:08.439
Yeah.

15:08.441 --> 15:09.941
We're out of pine springs.

15:09.943 --> 15:11.175
Ah. Thought so.

15:11.177 --> 15:12.477
Never seen
so many red serge jackets

15:12.479 --> 15:14.512
In the span of a few days.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.547
I'd, uh, I'd be surprised

15:16.549 --> 15:18.283
If he's still around
these parts.

15:18.285 --> 15:19.350
I'm not so sure
about that.

15:19.352 --> 15:20.385
Why's that?

15:20.387 --> 15:22.487
We found his horse
24 hours ago,

15:22.489 --> 15:24.589
Roaming through a forest
west of here.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.291
What makes you so sure
it's his?

15:26.293 --> 15:27.992
Blood.

15:27.994 --> 15:29.527
He was wounded
in his last robbery.

15:29.529 --> 15:32.230
I heard.

15:32.232 --> 15:34.132
What are you doing
all the way out here

15:34.134 --> 15:35.566
If you found the horse
back there?

15:35.568 --> 15:37.235
Did a thorough search
of the area,

15:37.237 --> 15:39.337
Couldn't find hide nor hair.

15:39.339 --> 15:41.372
Figured tolliver
left his horse there

15:41.374 --> 15:43.274
To throw us off his trail.

15:43.276 --> 15:46.110
Where exactly was this?

15:46.112 --> 15:47.345
Just outside
a little mining town

15:47.347 --> 15:48.546
About a day's ride from here.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.548
Place called
coal valley.

15:50.550 --> 15:53.084
[♪]

15:54.420 --> 15:56.387
[shouts]:
Where are you going?

15:59.224 --> 16:01.159
[julie]:
What are you doing?

16:01.161 --> 16:02.293
Sorry.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.195
I didn't mean
to startle you.

16:04.197 --> 16:06.431
I've imposed long enough.

16:06.433 --> 16:08.333
You're going to leave?

16:08.335 --> 16:09.600
Without me?

16:09.602 --> 16:12.003
I mean,
without saying goodbye?

16:14.740 --> 16:18.142
Only long enough
to get myself put together...

16:18.144 --> 16:21.079
Get settled in a new life.

16:23.082 --> 16:26.217
One you could be
proud to be a part of.

16:26.219 --> 16:27.518
[sighs] oh...

16:27.520 --> 16:29.721
Nathaniel,

16:29.723 --> 16:33.524
You don't know how much it means
to hear you say that.

16:36.395 --> 16:39.197
[♪]

16:49.174 --> 16:51.342
I'm sorry.
That was presumptuous.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.578
It's all right.

16:53.580 --> 16:56.147
It was meant to happen.

16:57.182 --> 16:59.217
I'm tryin'

16:59.219 --> 17:02.220
To remember
what happened to me.

17:02.222 --> 17:04.122
It's all so confusing.

17:05.257 --> 17:07.625
I lost a whole chunk of memory

17:07.627 --> 17:11.429
After I got fevered
from that infection.

17:11.431 --> 17:14.198
That cabin,
where you found me at...

17:15.567 --> 17:17.168
How far is it?

17:17.170 --> 17:19.270
Outside of town,
a few miles.

17:19.272 --> 17:21.406
Could you point out
the general direction?

17:22.641 --> 17:25.643
I left my knapsack
filled with my things.

17:25.645 --> 17:28.379
There's a picture of my mother
in that bag.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.648
How sweet.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.483
Of course.

17:32.485 --> 17:34.285
You can borrow my horse.

17:34.287 --> 17:36.254
I'll draw you a map.

17:36.256 --> 17:38.256
That'd be most kind.

17:49.535 --> 17:52.170
[♪]

17:53.138 --> 17:55.473
Wait for me.

17:55.475 --> 17:58.242
I will.

18:00.679 --> 18:03.314
[♪]

18:42.621 --> 18:45.323
Elizabeth,
you work too much.

18:46.725 --> 18:47.692
I'm a teacher, julie.

18:47.694 --> 18:48.693
I'm just grading papers

18:48.695 --> 18:50.294
And waiting for rip

18:50.296 --> 18:52.230
To wake up
from his fifth nap.

18:52.232 --> 18:55.533
More than any animal
I've ever met.

18:55.535 --> 18:57.735
Besides, I'm just...

18:57.737 --> 18:59.570
Trying to keep busy.

18:59.572 --> 19:01.906
[sighs and sets cup
down on table]

19:01.908 --> 19:03.608
I saw how
he looked at you.

19:03.610 --> 19:06.210
Jack will be back.
I'm sure.

19:06.212 --> 19:09.213
The bonds of love
are not easily broken.

19:09.215 --> 19:10.214
Keep your voice down.

19:12.417 --> 19:13.551
And love?

19:13.553 --> 19:15.653
Who said anything
about love?

19:15.655 --> 19:17.655
Well, did you
kiss him?

19:17.657 --> 19:19.390
Of course not.

19:19.392 --> 19:21.192
I've only known him
a short while,

19:21.194 --> 19:22.660
And a kiss
is something that

19:22.662 --> 19:24.529
Comes after
a courtship and...

19:24.531 --> 19:28.332
You don't need to know someone a
great while to share a kiss.

19:29.868 --> 19:31.469
What's going on with you?

19:31.471 --> 19:32.637
Whatever do you mean?

19:32.639 --> 19:34.272
Stop those games.
What is it?

19:35.440 --> 19:37.675
Well, if you must know...

19:37.677 --> 19:39.810
I'm in love.

19:41.246 --> 19:42.513
Love?

19:42.515 --> 19:43.514
Mm-hmm!

19:43.516 --> 19:44.815
What are you talking about?

19:44.817 --> 19:46.250
You found a man in the woods

19:46.252 --> 19:47.685
And now you're talking
about love?

19:47.687 --> 19:49.253
I know how
my heart feels.

19:49.255 --> 19:51.789
No one's ever
given him a chance.

19:51.791 --> 19:53.291
I won't be
another person

19:53.293 --> 19:54.725
To just turn
my back on him.

19:54.727 --> 19:55.826
I can't believe
what you're saying right now.

19:55.828 --> 19:57.495
You don't even know this man!

19:57.497 --> 19:59.864
You don't want me
to be happy?

19:59.866 --> 20:01.666
Of course,
I want you to be happy,

20:01.668 --> 20:04.202
But this is absurd.

20:04.204 --> 20:06.470
Why? Because he's not rich
and educated?

20:06.472 --> 20:09.607
This is about
a man's character and integrity.

20:09.609 --> 20:12.376
You always think
I'm a foolish girl.

20:13.345 --> 20:16.347
[♪]

20:21.453 --> 20:23.888
Do you remember that man
I had you look into for me?

20:25.490 --> 20:27.358
Billy hamilton?

20:28.560 --> 20:30.361
Mm-hmm.

20:30.363 --> 20:33.397
Well, he completely
fooled me.

20:33.399 --> 20:35.733
Jack and I
were at odds at the time,

20:35.735 --> 20:37.501
And I thought

20:37.503 --> 20:40.705
This man and I
might have a future together.

20:41.807 --> 20:43.808
Anyway...

20:43.810 --> 20:47.378
He turned out to be a con artist
who preyed on my emotions.

20:47.380 --> 20:49.914
He didn't care about me.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.883
He cared about
the family fortune.

20:54.486 --> 20:56.520
Now all I care about

20:56.522 --> 20:57.722
Is that you don't get
taken advantage of

20:57.724 --> 21:00.391
The same way I did.

21:01.660 --> 21:04.595
Not every man
has good intentions, julie.

21:08.700 --> 21:10.568
What is it?

21:13.572 --> 21:17.642
I may not have told you
nathaniel's entire story.

21:19.678 --> 21:21.512
Don't do this!

21:21.514 --> 21:22.813
We have to report him.

21:22.815 --> 21:24.415
No, we most
certainly do not.

21:24.417 --> 21:25.650
Well, then I do.

21:25.652 --> 21:28.386
It's his brother's gang.
He had no choice!

21:28.388 --> 21:30.888
He was orphaned
when he was only five,

21:30.890 --> 21:32.556
And his brother
raised him.

21:32.558 --> 21:34.792
And now, all he wants
is to become a better man

21:34.794 --> 21:36.627
And to share
his life with me!

21:36.629 --> 21:38.029
Are you even
listening to yourself?

21:38.031 --> 21:39.664
What kind of life
would you have?

21:39.666 --> 21:40.931
That man is a criminal!

21:40.933 --> 21:42.600
This why I didn't
want to tell you!

21:42.602 --> 21:45.436
You don't understand
nathaniel the way that I do.

21:45.438 --> 21:47.672
[♪]

21:49.541 --> 21:50.808
How can you
do this to me?

21:50.810 --> 21:52.543
To you?

21:52.545 --> 21:54.445
You may have put everyone
in this town in danger.

21:54.447 --> 21:55.780
Oh! Don't be
so dramatic!

21:55.782 --> 21:56.847
He's gone, elizabeth.

21:56.849 --> 21:58.716
He can't hurt anyone
if he's not here.

21:58.718 --> 22:00.985
I have to write
constable o'reilly a note

22:00.987 --> 22:02.586
And then you and I
are going to go have

22:02.588 --> 22:04.422
A talk with abigail.

22:04.424 --> 22:06.757
[boot heels thumping]

22:12.898 --> 22:15.566
Afternoon, fellas.
What'll it be?

22:15.568 --> 22:17.902
Whiskey. All around.

22:19.538 --> 22:22.073
You just passing through,

22:22.075 --> 22:24.809
Or, uh, are you here
to work the mine?

22:24.811 --> 22:25.876
The mine?

22:25.878 --> 22:27.845
The coal mine.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.847
It's about all we have to offer
by way of jobs in this town.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.882
That sounds like
interesting work,

22:31.884 --> 22:33.784
But, actually,
we're just passing through.

22:33.786 --> 22:35.920
A friend who might've
come through here.

22:35.922 --> 22:37.788
Well, I'm the mayor,

22:37.790 --> 22:39.824
And I tend to know all of
the important news of the day.

22:39.826 --> 22:42.426
Very few strangers
come to coal valley.

22:42.428 --> 22:48.733
There was a man
involved in a hunting accident.

22:48.735 --> 22:49.867
Shot?

22:49.869 --> 22:51.736
I believe so.

22:51.738 --> 22:53.537
He was mighty sick
when he was found in the forest.

22:53.539 --> 22:55.973
This man,
where is he now?

22:55.975 --> 22:57.808
We're hoping
he's a friend of ours.

22:57.810 --> 22:58.943
Well, last I heard,

22:58.945 --> 23:01.746
He was staying
over at abigail's cafe,

23:01.748 --> 23:03.614
Uh, just across the street.

23:03.616 --> 23:06.450
The ladies are nursing him
back to health.

23:08.887 --> 23:10.921
Well, we're mighty grateful
for your help, mr. Mayor.

23:10.923 --> 23:11.889
Don't mention it.

23:11.891 --> 23:13.758
If you're hungry,

23:13.760 --> 23:16.060
Get abigail to serve you
her beef stew.

23:16.062 --> 23:17.995
You'll be glad
I recommended it.

23:17.997 --> 23:20.030
Thank you kindly.

23:23.435 --> 23:25.803
[footsteps receding]

23:26.805 --> 23:29.640
Honestly, julie.

23:29.642 --> 23:31.709
I still don't see what
you're getting so upset about.

23:31.711 --> 23:35.012
Is because
he was protecting someone else.

23:35.014 --> 23:36.480
That's just
what he told you!

23:36.482 --> 23:37.515
We're in trouble.

23:37.517 --> 23:38.482
We don't know that.

23:38.484 --> 23:40.551
We need
to find patrick.

23:40.553 --> 23:41.585
[door swings open]

23:43.789 --> 23:45.723
Good afternoon, ladies.

23:45.725 --> 23:47.658
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

23:47.660 --> 23:48.959
Is there something
we can help you with?

23:48.961 --> 23:50.528
We're looking
for our friend.

23:50.530 --> 23:52.963
We're told
you might know where he is.

23:52.965 --> 23:55.566
If you mean nathaniel,
he's already gone.

23:55.568 --> 23:56.767
"nathaniel"?

23:56.769 --> 23:57.835
[chuckles]

23:57.837 --> 23:59.537
D'you hear that?

23:59.539 --> 24:01.038
Gone where?

24:01.040 --> 24:02.973
[gasping]

24:02.975 --> 24:05.509
Julie, if you know
where he went,

24:05.511 --> 24:07.478
You tell them
this minute.

24:07.480 --> 24:09.079
He was shot

24:09.081 --> 24:11.749
And it gave him
some time to think,

24:11.751 --> 24:13.751
And he's not interested

24:13.753 --> 24:15.753
In a life of crime anymore.

24:15.755 --> 24:17.655
You need to
let your brother be.

24:17.657 --> 24:19.657
Our brother?

24:19.659 --> 24:21.826
Nate ain't got
no brother.

24:21.828 --> 24:23.027
What?

24:23.029 --> 24:25.696
Tie those two up
and take 'em upstairs.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.602
No, no, no. No, no!

24:31.604 --> 24:33.737
This one's gonna
take us to find nate.

24:33.739 --> 24:34.772
No! You can't take her!

24:34.774 --> 24:36.006
She's my sister.

24:36.008 --> 24:37.007
Take me instead.

24:37.009 --> 24:38.142
[gasps] elizabeth!

24:39.511 --> 24:42.079
Tear this into strips

24:42.081 --> 24:43.080
And tie up the cook.

24:43.082 --> 24:44.615
We'll take
both the sisters, then.

24:44.617 --> 24:46.083
-No.
-Oh!

Do you think

25:11.077 --> 25:12.943
Mrs. Stanton
will say anything?

25:12.945 --> 25:15.746
Do you think she'll give
that file to the authorities?

25:15.748 --> 25:17.882
No, not as long
as she thinks

25:17.884 --> 25:19.984
Her husband
may be responsible for it.

25:19.986 --> 25:21.719
But that ain't true.

25:21.721 --> 25:23.854
She doesn't
know that.

25:23.856 --> 25:25.956
But...

25:25.958 --> 25:28.659
I don't want
to take any chances.

Are you hurt?

Just my pride.

26:25.918 --> 26:27.017
Nate tolliver.

26:27.019 --> 26:29.153
He was holed up
at the cafe.

26:29.155 --> 26:32.122
I followed him
and he ambushed me.

26:32.124 --> 26:34.758
Tied me to my horse
and spooked him.

26:34.760 --> 26:35.960
Is elizabeth okay?

26:35.962 --> 26:36.994
I don't know.

Jack, we got to

[chuckling continues]

26:56.148 --> 26:58.916
I see you brought
some friends.

26:58.918 --> 27:01.051
Take 'em inside,
tie 'em up.

27:01.053 --> 27:03.053
I buried the loot
somewhere out back

27:03.055 --> 27:04.254
Before I got sick.

27:04.256 --> 27:05.656
Grab a shovel.
Let's dig it up.

27:08.026 --> 27:09.860
Nathaniel,
I don't understand.

27:09.862 --> 27:11.228
Julie, don't
speak to that man.

27:11.230 --> 27:13.697
Any guy that says
hello to you,

27:13.699 --> 27:15.866
And you're judging me?

This isn't happening.

27:16.902 --> 27:18.335
This isn't happening.

27:18.337 --> 27:19.937
Yes, julie,
this is happening.

27:19.939 --> 27:21.672
This is real.

27:21.674 --> 27:22.773
It's time to grow up

27:22.775 --> 27:24.675
And see the world
as it really is.

27:24.677 --> 27:25.976
I'm so sorry,
elizabeth.

27:25.978 --> 27:27.811
I did this.

27:27.813 --> 27:30.080
I put us
in this danger.

27:30.082 --> 27:32.082
We're gonna
probably die here.

27:32.084 --> 27:33.651
They have no reason
to kill us.

27:33.653 --> 27:35.886
They'll probably just
take their money and go.

27:55.273 --> 27:57.341
Elizabeth?

28:09.922 --> 28:11.288
Where?

28:11.290 --> 28:12.756
I don't know, but jack,
these men are ruthless.

28:13.925 --> 28:16.026
You took julie for a ride.
Where did you go?

28:16.028 --> 28:17.194
I'll show you.

28:17.196 --> 28:19.096
We need to
make one stop first!

28:20.165 --> 28:22.166
Be careful!

What can I do for you?

28:30.209 --> 28:31.208
I want to
deputize your men

28:31.210 --> 28:32.776
For an assignment.

28:32.778 --> 28:33.977
The tolliver gang
has kidnapped

28:33.979 --> 28:35.279
Miss thatcher
and her sister.

28:35.281 --> 28:36.780
Does this have to do

28:36.782 --> 28:38.315
With the man
that she found in the woods?

28:38.317 --> 28:40.117
-Yes, it does.
-Well, I'm sorry--

28:40.119 --> 28:41.285
But that's not my concern.

28:41.287 --> 28:43.454
What do you mean?

28:43.456 --> 28:45.389
What I mean is,
that's not company business.

28:45.391 --> 28:46.824
Now, if the gang
were still in town

28:46.826 --> 28:49.226
And they were threatening
company assets,

28:49.228 --> 28:51.328
Then perhaps
we'd be in agreement.

28:51.330 --> 28:52.429
But they're gone now,

28:52.431 --> 28:54.298
And as far as I'm concerned,

28:54.300 --> 28:56.834
Those girls
got themselves into trouble,

28:56.836 --> 28:59.336
So, unless
there's anything else,

28:59.338 --> 29:01.839
I'm a little busy right now.

29:05.810 --> 29:07.344

We need help, jack.

29:10.049 --> 29:11.982

where we can find some.

29:18.323 --> 29:20.357
I like
your sister.

29:20.359 --> 29:22.259
Mm.

29:22.261 --> 29:24.394
She's a real lady.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.931
But you're a, uh,
school teacher, right?

29:29.501 --> 29:31.268
I like school
teachers, too.

29:31.270 --> 29:32.069
Get away from her.

29:32.071 --> 29:34.004
Or what?

29:34.006 --> 29:36.140
I hate you.

29:43.081 --> 29:45.916
Well, now you gone
and hurt my feelings.

29:45.918 --> 29:47.084
The man who's
courting my sister

29:47.086 --> 29:48.118
Is a mountie,

29:48.120 --> 29:50.187
And he will come
looking for her,

29:50.189 --> 29:51.889
So you best leave before
he finds that you took her

29:51.891 --> 29:52.956
Because he'll--

29:52.958 --> 29:54.858
Now you're wishing me ill.

29:54.860 --> 29:57.895
Here I thought
you really cared about me.

There's only one mountie.

We're gonna be taking
any orders from you.

There are a dozen mounties
in these woods...

31:04.897 --> 31:07.097
They're mounties.

31:07.099 --> 31:10.334
They'll never fire
as long as we have these women.

31:10.336 --> 31:12.536
You're right, nate.

31:12.538 --> 31:14.905
So here's
what we're gonna do.

31:14.907 --> 31:16.540
Easy.

31:16.542 --> 31:18.508
I'm gonna take out my weapon

31:18.510 --> 31:20.210
And I'm gonna drop it.

31:20.212 --> 31:21.545
[thud]

31:21.547 --> 31:23.480
Now, you let these women go,

31:23.482 --> 31:26.350
And my men will do the same.

31:26.352 --> 31:27.985
Soon as I do that,

I lose all my leverage,
so, uh...

Or my men
start shooting.

on your innocence

32:44.563 --> 32:46.463
And goodness.

32:46.465 --> 32:50.300
I was a fool.
I know that now.

32:50.302 --> 32:53.971
I'll never let myself
be that easily used again.

32:53.973 --> 32:56.473
Thank the lord we're all okay.

32:56.475 --> 32:59.543
And thank the lord
for sending the mounties.

33:01.079 --> 33:03.080
Yes.

33:04.182 --> 33:05.582
He came back
for you.

33:05.584 --> 33:07.351
He came back
for the town.

33:07.353 --> 33:08.552
It's his job.

33:08.554 --> 33:10.454
He didn't
have to come back.

33:10.456 --> 33:13.390
Well, he'll be
escorting them to prison

33:13.392 --> 33:14.992
And then I'm sure

33:14.994 --> 33:17.427
He'll head to his new
posting after that.

33:23.368 --> 33:26.036
[♪]

33:50.395 --> 33:52.396
You know, what you and o'reilly
did out there was very brave.

33:52.398 --> 33:54.364
Ahh...

33:54.366 --> 33:56.466
There's a lot of men
trying to capture this bunch.

33:56.468 --> 33:57.667
We got lucky.

33:57.669 --> 33:59.669
Plus, it's what
we trained for.

33:59.671 --> 34:02.639
Well, I don't think
that tablecloth maneuver

34:02.641 --> 34:04.741
Was part of your training.

34:04.743 --> 34:08.311
Getting the horses in red
to surround them like that

34:08.313 --> 34:10.580
Was truly inspired.

34:10.582 --> 34:12.149
You know, you're gonna get

34:12.151 --> 34:14.351
Your pick of assignments
after this arrest.

34:14.353 --> 34:16.319
Make your career.

34:16.321 --> 34:18.688
Well, anyway, I'm glad
I was here to see it,

34:18.690 --> 34:21.758
And I'm glad I get to deliver
these men to justice with you,

34:21.760 --> 34:23.527
Because this is
my last assignment.

34:24.796 --> 34:28.398
Yeah. Got a little cabin
up in the mountains here.

34:28.400 --> 34:31.535
I'm gonna be fishing
and hunting till my last day.

34:31.537 --> 34:34.137
Thanks again.

34:34.139 --> 34:35.439
Sam?

34:35.441 --> 34:37.441
Huh?

34:38.609 --> 34:40.343
If you could go back,

34:40.345 --> 34:42.345
If you could do it
all over again,

34:42.347 --> 34:43.547
Would you choose this life?

34:43.549 --> 34:45.382
Living on the road

34:45.384 --> 34:47.484
And not settling down
and having a family?

34:47.486 --> 34:49.152
We can't go back.

34:49.154 --> 34:51.354
That's not part of the deal.

34:51.356 --> 34:54.257
I guess it's the path
we've chosen, right?

34:54.259 --> 34:57.360
You know, I was
at your father's funeral.

34:57.362 --> 35:00.597
I remember thinking
he was a truly rich man.

35:00.599 --> 35:03.400
He got a good woman

35:03.402 --> 35:04.534
And a fine son
to weep over him

35:04.536 --> 35:06.570
And remember him.

35:06.572 --> 35:09.573
That's true wealth.

35:09.575 --> 35:11.441
Well, he was
a great father.

35:11.443 --> 35:13.110
I only hope

35:13.112 --> 35:14.845
When I draw
my last breath

35:14.847 --> 35:16.413
There's someone there
who cares enough

35:16.415 --> 35:18.582
To feel that way
about me.

35:21.652 --> 35:23.520
Okay. Let's go.

35:44.408 --> 35:46.643
[sighs] will you
excuse me for a moment?

35:46.645 --> 35:49.279
Where are you going?

35:52.583 --> 35:55.185
[smack]

35:59.490 --> 36:01.758
Feel better?

36:01.760 --> 36:04.327
Somewhat.

36:12.770 --> 36:15.305
I'll catch up with you.

36:24.515 --> 36:26.516
Abigail?

36:26.518 --> 36:28.585
Jack.

36:29.787 --> 36:32.189
Jack, I found a file.

36:34.625 --> 36:38.628
Actually, I didn't find it.
I stole it from gowen's office.

36:38.630 --> 36:39.629
For the record,

36:39.631 --> 36:40.964
I do not
condone stealing,

36:40.966 --> 36:43.667
But on a personal note,
I'm quite impressed.

36:44.835 --> 36:48.538
I think it's proof
that corners were cut.

36:48.540 --> 36:50.207
I-it's not clear

36:50.209 --> 36:53.243
Who authorized the cuts
or who implemented them.

36:54.712 --> 36:57.247
My late husband might have
even missed something.

36:57.249 --> 37:00.750
He knew more about it
than you thought he did?

37:00.752 --> 37:04.321
But the truth is the truth,
no matter how it plays out,

37:04.323 --> 37:05.755
And everyone in this town

37:05.757 --> 37:07.824
Deserves to know
what really happened.

37:07.826 --> 37:09.893
Mm.

37:17.935 --> 37:19.836
I'll get in touch with
an investigator I know

37:19.838 --> 37:21.238
In cape fullerton,

37:21.240 --> 37:22.806
And we'll see
where this takes us.

37:22.808 --> 37:24.674
Thank you, jack.

37:24.676 --> 37:26.543
You're welcome.

37:30.414 --> 37:31.548
[sighs]

37:37.755 --> 37:39.489
[door swings open]

37:43.494 --> 37:44.894
Jack.

37:46.697 --> 37:48.698
When I was out there

37:48.700 --> 37:51.534
And I thought
that you were in trouble...

37:51.536 --> 37:53.470
When I thought
there was even a chance

37:53.472 --> 37:55.372
That you were in danger,
and I wasn't here...

37:55.374 --> 37:56.873
[takes a shaky breath]

37:56.875 --> 37:58.708
You can't be everywhere.

37:58.710 --> 38:00.677
You saved all of us.

38:00.679 --> 38:02.879
I want you to know

38:02.881 --> 38:05.782
That I had nothing on my mind
but getting back to you.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.550
Really?

38:07.552 --> 38:08.952
I was so...

38:08.954 --> 38:11.321
Focused on doing my job,

38:11.323 --> 38:12.922
Doing what
I was trained to do--

38:12.924 --> 38:15.725
Chasing bad guys...

38:21.799 --> 38:24.000
I don't know
what's gonna happen next,

38:24.002 --> 38:25.568
I don't know where
I'm gonna be tomorrow,

38:25.570 --> 38:26.770
But I don't
want to regret

38:26.772 --> 38:29.372
Not telling you
what I was thinking...

38:29.374 --> 38:31.841
What I was--

38:31.843 --> 38:33.877
[sighs]
...What I am feeling.

38:40.384 --> 38:42.852
I can't leave without
telling you that...

38:44.422 --> 38:45.689
Yes?

38:45.691 --> 38:46.890
I care.

38:46.892 --> 38:49.326
I care
that you're safe.

38:50.795 --> 38:52.862
I'm good.

38:53.831 --> 38:56.099
[chuckles]

38:56.101 --> 38:59.869
I have to go
and escort these men to trial.

38:59.871 --> 39:01.938
I understand.

39:01.940 --> 39:03.673
There's forms to fill out
and paperwork...

39:03.675 --> 39:05.542
Of course.

39:05.544 --> 39:06.943
So...

39:06.945 --> 39:08.845
I need to go.

39:08.847 --> 39:10.947
I know.

39:12.950 --> 39:14.784
I'll see you soon.

39:14.786 --> 39:16.720
You will.

39:16.722 --> 39:18.955
[she sighs
as his footsteps recede]

39:29.467 --> 39:32.469
[♪]

39:40.544 --> 39:42.379
Remember
when we were little

39:42.381 --> 39:45.849
And I was afraid of the monsters
that lived under the bed?

39:45.851 --> 39:47.784
[chuckles]
I remember well.

39:47.786 --> 39:50.453
I agreed to stay up all night
and keep a lookout for them.

39:50.455 --> 39:52.622
The only reason
I felt safe

39:52.624 --> 39:55.558
Was because I trusted you
to take care of me.

39:55.560 --> 39:56.860
I'm your big sister.

39:56.862 --> 39:59.629
It was my job to protect you.

39:59.631 --> 40:02.399
I always felt safe
when you were there.

40:02.401 --> 40:03.566
You know,
as soon as you fell asleep,

40:03.568 --> 40:04.768
I went to sleep, too.

40:04.770 --> 40:05.802
Really?

40:05.804 --> 40:06.803
[laughs]

40:06.805 --> 40:08.805
Yes, I guess that makes sense.

40:12.009 --> 40:14.844
It's been a long few days.

40:14.846 --> 40:17.080
Go to sleep now.

40:17.082 --> 40:20.183
Thank you
for taking care of me.

40:20.185 --> 40:22.085
I should've listened to you.

40:24.021 --> 40:26.990
I was a fool to believe
that horrible man.

40:26.992 --> 40:29.759
We all make mistakes.

40:30.961 --> 40:33.763
Thank you
for being my big sister.

40:33.765 --> 40:35.965
Thank you for being
my little sister.

40:35.967 --> 40:37.801
[chuckles]

40:42.473 --> 40:44.040
Will you stay up

40:44.042 --> 40:46.576
And watch out for monsters?

40:46.578 --> 40:48.445
I will.

41:00.958 --> 41:03.493
[♪]

41:03.495 --> 41:05.695
