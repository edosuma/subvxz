30:53.360 --> 30:55.210
in the wrong woman's car

30:55.410 --> 30:57.000
with a snout
full of booger sugar

30:57.200 --> 31:00.210
on the front page
of the <i>Globe</i> and the <i>Herald.</i>

31:00.410 --> 31:02.590
You see,

31:02.790 --> 31:06.760
this is not college
or law school, son.

31:06.960 --> 31:09.560
You're not some spoiled rich kid
barely rocking a C-plus.

31:09.760 --> 31:11.430
You're a Beltway man now.

31:11.630 --> 31:12.890
Kind of guy that people

31:13.090 --> 31:14.850
enjoy knocking down
a peg or two.

31:15.050 --> 31:16.900
So these charges,

31:17.100 --> 31:19.520
they're not just gonna
get swept under the rug.

31:19.720 --> 31:20.940
We're not gonna let 'em.

31:21.140 --> 31:23.570
- Want to know why?
- Okay. Why?

31:23.770 --> 31:24.990
'Cause we don't like you.

31:25.190 --> 31:26.200
- [tongue clicks]
- I don't even know

31:26.400 --> 31:27.660
- why you're here.
- [Reacher] We're here

31:27.860 --> 31:31.330
'cause we want to know
everything there is to know

31:31.530 --> 31:32.890
about Little Wing.

31:41.100 --> 31:42.550
- I should probably...
- Yeah, you should.

31:42.750 --> 31:45.090
Yeah. I'm gonna
call Mr. Boyd's wife.

31:45.290 --> 31:47.180
Eh, she's probably worried
about him over in D.C.

31:47.380 --> 31:48.590
Worried sick.

31:48.790 --> 31:50.050
You know, happy wife,
happy life, huh?

31:50.250 --> 31:52.060
- <i>[line ringing]</i>
- Okay. Fine.

31:52.260 --> 31:53.770
- <i>[woman] Hello?</i>
- Wrong number.

31:53.970 --> 31:57.140
- Talk.
- It's not that big of a deal.

31:57.340 --> 31:58.770
Little Wing is just a code name.

31:58.970 --> 32:00.770
- For what?
- For a new technology

32:00.970 --> 32:02.690
currently in development.

32:02.890 --> 32:04.490
Some incredible
anti-missile software

32:04.690 --> 32:07.410
originally developed
to protect commercial aircraft,

32:07.600 --> 32:09.990
but a certain aeronautics
company approached us.

32:10.190 --> 32:12.910
Let me guess-- New Age?

32:13.110 --> 32:14.620
[Boyd] That's right. New Age.

32:14.820 --> 32:16.460
They found the software
could be tweaked.

32:16.660 --> 32:19.500
It could be used in missiles
and not just against them.

32:19.700 --> 32:21.840
It could be scaled down
and installed

32:22.040 --> 32:24.960
in portable shoulder-fired
surface-to-air weaponry.

32:25.160 --> 32:26.880
The software allows missiles

32:27.080 --> 32:29.720
to defeat all known
countermeasures.

32:29.920 --> 32:31.550
- How?
- That's a question

32:31.750 --> 32:33.060
for a nerd in a lab coat, man.

32:33.260 --> 32:36.770
Okay? All I know is that
missiles shot from the ground

32:36.970 --> 32:38.810
completely bypass their target,

32:39.010 --> 32:41.150
making pilots believe
the threat has passed,

32:41.350 --> 32:43.860
and then they recalibrate,
turn around,

32:44.060 --> 32:46.240
zero back in on the aircraft
and reattack.

32:46.440 --> 32:49.780
It's death from above
and there is no way to avoid it.

32:49.980 --> 32:52.330
You fire, you hit your target.

32:52.520 --> 32:54.090
Period.

32:56.720 --> 32:58.580
And what's Senator Lavoy's
involvement?

32:58.780 --> 33:01.290
Well, the project required an
appropriation bill, all right?

33:01.490 --> 33:02.710
You want to get one passed?

33:02.910 --> 33:05.460
You're looking at years
of bureaucratic bullshit

33:05.660 --> 33:09.180
all thanks to some arcane laws
on modifying civilian tech.

33:09.370 --> 33:12.010
But Lavoy knew Little Wing
would slingshot

33:12.210 --> 33:16.140
our military into the future,
so if we just sat on our hands,

33:16.340 --> 33:18.270
waiting for it to go through
the proper channels,

33:18.470 --> 33:20.940
it would never happen.

33:21.140 --> 33:23.060
So I'm assuming Lavoy
didn't clear up the red tape

33:23.260 --> 33:25.360
in the most reputable manner?

33:25.560 --> 33:28.610
I helped bury the proposal
in a thousand-page statute

33:28.810 --> 33:30.240
while Lavoy shook hands
and drummed up votes.

33:30.440 --> 33:31.950
No one even knew
it was in there.

33:32.150 --> 33:35.080
And he did this out of
the goodness of his heart?

33:35.280 --> 33:37.450
To protect democracy?

33:37.650 --> 33:41.500
No fat envelopes slipped inside
newspapers on park benches?

33:41.700 --> 33:43.210
Grow the fuck up, okay?

33:43.410 --> 33:46.170
It's D.C.
It's how shit gets done.

33:46.370 --> 33:49.470
Besides, Lavoy knew Little Wing
would save lives.

33:49.660 --> 33:51.090
I mean... [chortles]

33:51.290 --> 33:53.840
everyone made fun of
the <i>Star Wars</i> defense program,

33:54.040 --> 33:56.430
but, hey, look at where
we are now.

33:56.630 --> 33:59.640
Everyone's trying to shoot
projectiles out of the air.

33:59.840 --> 34:03.200
Little Wing can knock
anything out of the sky.

34:06.580 --> 34:09.780
Anything?
Like commercial aircraft?

34:09.980 --> 34:12.490
You fire, you hit the target.
You said so yourself.

34:12.690 --> 34:14.820
Yeah, but it's our tech.
We have it.

34:15.020 --> 34:17.080
Nobody else can
get their hands on it.

34:17.280 --> 34:19.250
Nothing like you're thinking
is going to happen.

34:19.440 --> 34:22.160
New Age is incredibly secure.
Both of their facilities

34:22.360 --> 34:24.640
- implement state-of-the-art...
- Both facilities?

34:25.980 --> 34:28.380
- What do you mean?
- New Age has two bases.

34:28.580 --> 34:29.800
Software made in New York,

34:30.000 --> 34:32.300
hardware at
a manufacturing plant in Denver.

34:32.500 --> 34:34.220
- What else can you tell us?
- Nothing.

34:34.420 --> 34:36.400
That's all I know. I swear.

34:37.650 --> 34:40.100
Hey, Lavoy and me--
we-we cut some corners,

34:40.300 --> 34:42.390
we did some stuff
we should not have done,

34:42.590 --> 34:45.270
but it was all to get
a defense bill passed,

34:45.470 --> 34:47.230
protect the country.

34:47.430 --> 34:49.320
How'd that work out?

34:49.520 --> 34:51.070
Hey, excuse me.

34:51.270 --> 34:54.780
So, are the drug charges
getting dropped or what?

34:54.980 --> 34:58.130
I don't know. I'm not a cop.

35:06.100 --> 35:08.090
Heck of a surprise
getting a call from you.

35:08.290 --> 35:11.300
Hell of a surprise hearing
you're wearing the badge again.

35:11.500 --> 35:12.920
Lieutenant, no less.

35:13.120 --> 35:15.050
Yeah, well,
retirement didn't suit me.

35:15.250 --> 35:18.570
Speaking of suits, see
you're still sporting the tweed.

35:20.110 --> 35:21.520
Reliable as ever, Finlay.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.350
Speak for yourself.

35:23.550 --> 35:25.770
What was it you told me
when we first met--

35:25.970 --> 35:28.290
trouble always seems
to find you?

35:29.920 --> 35:31.570
You kill a whole lot of people?

35:31.770 --> 35:33.030
Here and there.

35:33.230 --> 35:35.820
- You need my help?
- Already gave it.

35:36.020 --> 35:38.720
You still spinning
that wedding ring?

35:41.510 --> 35:44.910
Here and there.
But feeling better every day.

35:45.110 --> 35:47.000
- And the dog?
- Jack eats too much.

35:47.200 --> 35:48.540
Just like his namesake.

35:48.740 --> 35:50.090
[Neagley] Today, boss.

35:50.290 --> 35:51.840
Car's running,
and if I don't get out

35:52.040 --> 35:54.010
of this straitjacket soon,
things are gonna get ugly.

35:54.210 --> 35:55.930
Neagley?

35:56.120 --> 35:58.760
Didn't recognize you.
Looking good.

35:58.960 --> 36:01.070
Mind your business,
elbow patches.

36:02.820 --> 36:04.230
Hey, you heard the lady.

36:04.420 --> 36:06.980
If I don't have her in jeans
in 20 minutes,

36:07.180 --> 36:08.870
I'm done for.

36:09.910 --> 36:11.270
See you around, Reacher.

36:11.470 --> 36:13.330
See you around, Finlay.

36:24.090 --> 36:26.290
So, Little Wing
could be our next 9/11.

36:26.490 --> 36:29.080
- What are our directives?
- You and Dixon go to Denver.

36:29.280 --> 36:30.670
The Little Wing software
is useless

36:30.870 --> 36:32.420
without the missile hardware,
and that's where it's made.

36:32.620 --> 36:33.840
Maybe you can gum up the works,

36:34.040 --> 36:35.800
keep the missiles
out of the wrong hands.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.800
O'Donnell and I
will head down to D.C.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.100
Want to swing by Homeland,
see what they know about A.M.

36:42.300 --> 36:43.350
If taking out airplanes
is his M.O.,

36:43.550 --> 36:44.770
they might have
some intel on him.

36:44.970 --> 36:46.430
[O'Donnell] How do you figure
we're gonna do that?

36:46.630 --> 36:47.770
You think we're just gonna
knock on the door

36:47.970 --> 36:50.020
and say, "Can the DoD
come out and play?"

36:50.220 --> 36:52.610
My brother worked for Homeland.

36:52.810 --> 36:54.280
His contacts can help us.

36:54.470 --> 36:57.070
Oh, no shit.
How's Joe doing these days?

36:57.270 --> 36:58.420
He's dead.

37:03.430 --> 37:06.720
I'm starving. We should eat.

37:24.610 --> 37:27.060
[exhales] Dibs on the bathroom.

37:27.260 --> 37:28.850
- I need to get changed.
- [motorcycles approaching]

37:29.050 --> 37:30.390
Yeah? You gonna
throw it in the garbage

37:30.590 --> 37:32.270
like our sociopathic friend
here?

37:32.470 --> 37:33.690
Oh, why, you want to borrow it?

37:33.890 --> 37:35.460
Oh, yeah. I got the ass for it.

37:47.970 --> 37:50.250
[biker] Hate to ruin prom night,

37:50.450 --> 37:51.670
but hand over your guns.

37:51.870 --> 37:53.670
What makes you think
we have guns?

37:53.870 --> 37:56.060
We were told
you'd be packing, Reacher.

38:01.690 --> 38:03.090
[Reacher] They also tell you

38:03.290 --> 38:04.950
you'd die tonight?

38:06.240 --> 38:08.450
I'll die? That's funny.

38:14.580 --> 38:16.770
No guns, so no noise.

38:16.970 --> 38:18.280
[biker] They said
you were smart.

38:18.480 --> 38:21.400
I'm gonna cut you, gut you

38:21.600 --> 38:22.490
and leave you...

38:22.690 --> 38:24.590
[grunting]

38:34.890 --> 38:36.810
[tires screech]

38:48.360 --> 38:50.030
[grunting]

39:01.420 --> 39:03.630
[screams]

39:11.800 --> 39:13.350
Aah!

39:28.490 --> 39:29.700
[screaming]

39:35.870 --> 39:37.200
[engine revs]

39:47.130 --> 39:48.530
Everyone okay?

39:48.730 --> 39:50.660
Yeah. It'll heal.

39:50.860 --> 39:52.410
[O'Donnell groans]

39:52.610 --> 39:53.870
Never better.

39:54.070 --> 39:57.350
Fucked up my shoes,
but I'm fine.

40:10.150 --> 40:12.260
- <i>[Langston] Yeah.</i>
- Before you ask if it's done,

40:12.460 --> 40:15.310
it is, just not in the way
you hoped for.

40:15.510 --> 40:19.100
You're causing a very complex
operation a lot of problems.

40:19.300 --> 40:21.730
Sixty-five million dollars
worth, Langston?

40:21.930 --> 40:23.940
Assume that's who
I'm talking to.

40:24.140 --> 40:25.860
Head of security?

40:26.060 --> 40:28.110
Head of this whole thing?

40:28.310 --> 40:31.740
Maybe we've been approaching
this the wrong way, Mr. Reacher.

40:31.940 --> 40:33.990
Just Reacher.

40:34.190 --> 40:37.080
<i>Okay, Reacher.</i>
<i>Why don't we make a deal?</i>

40:37.280 --> 40:42.170
I have the means to give you
anything you could ask for.

40:42.370 --> 40:44.900
What is it that you want?

40:47.150 --> 40:49.840
I want to throw you
out of a helicopter.
