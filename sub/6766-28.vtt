WEBVTT

00:01.668 --> 00:03.135
Hey, Kel, you want a ride?

00:03.169 --> 00:04.295
We're about to leave.

00:04.337 --> 00:05.634
Coming.

00:05.672 --> 00:08.402
Hey, Tara, we'll hook up later
for group, okay?

00:08.441 --> 00:09.931
Uh-huh.

00:09.976 --> 00:11.568
Oh, hang on a second, guys.

00:11.611 --> 00:12.737
Get together...

00:12.779 --> 00:14.144
I want to get a group shot.

00:14.180 --> 00:15.738
- Okay. Um, guys?
- Yeah,

00:15.782 --> 00:17.750
- sure.
- Yeah, fine.

00:17.784 --> 00:19.376
Thanks.

00:19.419 --> 00:22.115
I want to have something
to remember you all by.

00:22.155 --> 00:23.179
Smile!

00:23.223 --> 00:25.123
Oh, great.

00:25.158 --> 00:26.125
I'd love a copy.

00:26.159 --> 00:26.989
No problem.

00:27.093 --> 00:28.583
Okay.

00:28.628 --> 00:29.822
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.421
Tara, can you feed
my fish for me? I forgot.

00:31.464 --> 00:32.726
- Sure.
- Just a dab.

00:32.766 --> 00:33.960
There's a new container
on the shelf.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.558
No problem.
I'll find it.

00:35.602 --> 00:36.660
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:36.703 --> 00:39.604
Bye.

00:39.639 --> 00:42.608
Well, Tara seems to have
accepted that she's moving out.

00:42.642 --> 00:45.167
Yeah. She's been great
since the hairdo fiasco.

00:45.211 --> 00:47.805
Oh, now I feel bad
that we're forcing her out.

00:47.847 --> 00:50.782
Don't. She knows
that she has to go.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.074

01:54.647 --> 01:57.616
Tara, can you feed
my fish for me? I forgot.

01:57.650 --> 01:59.948
Just a dab. There's
a new container on the shelf.

01:59.986 --> 02:01.078
Just a dab.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.954
Just a dab, just a dab...

03:47.994 --> 03:49.188
Colin, please, just sit down.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.356
It's not gonna make him
come out any faster.

03:51.397 --> 03:53.991
I'd like to be in there
since they are discussing me.

03:54.033 --> 03:55.500
Look, he knows what he's doing.

03:55.535 --> 03:57.264
Just calm down.

04:01.207 --> 04:04.005
Thanks, Teddy.
See you tomorrow.

04:07.280 --> 04:11.649
Well... you're
a very lucky man, Colin.

04:11.684 --> 04:12.844
- He accepted the deal?
- Better.

04:12.885 --> 04:13.943
He likes artists.

04:14.020 --> 04:15.715
He'll recommend the judge

04:15.755 --> 04:18.053
let you serve your six
months at a halfway house.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.353
- You're kidding me, right?
- No.

04:19.392 --> 04:21.154
And there's a place
right in West Hollywood.

04:21.194 --> 04:22.525
Oh, man!

04:22.562 --> 04:24.496
He won't, uh,
he won't change his mind?

04:24.530 --> 04:25.554
We have a deal.

04:25.598 --> 04:27.122
You enter your plea of guilty,

04:27.166 --> 04:28.724
the D.A. does the rest.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.895
No prison, my friend.

04:30.937 --> 04:32.700
That's amazing.
Thank you so much.

04:32.739 --> 04:33.899
Well, we're very fortunate.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.931
Of course, it all
has to be acceptable

04:35.975 --> 04:37.067
to the presiding judge,

04:37.110 --> 04:38.509
but tomorrow
Judge Hanlon is sitting,

04:38.544 --> 04:39.977
so don't sweat it.

04:40.046 --> 04:41.946
- Well, is he easy?
- Well, ask anyone.

04:41.981 --> 04:44.313
If it's a drug case,
he's the one you want.

04:44.350 --> 04:46.113
He's very, uh, progressive.

04:46.152 --> 04:47.414
I never thought I'd be

04:47.453 --> 04:49.512
looking forward
to going to court on this,

04:49.555 --> 04:51.079
but I think I'm actually ready.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.217
Great. We'll see you
tomorrow here about 11:00.

04:53.259 --> 04:54.954
We're about five cases
into the docket.

04:54.994 --> 04:56.723
And, uh, wear
something repentant.

04:56.763 --> 04:57.821
I will.

04:57.864 --> 04:58.956
I'll make sure of that.

04:58.998 --> 05:00.090
Listen, I got to go.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.600
- Enjoy your day.
- I intend to.

05:01.634 --> 05:03.363
Thanks again.

05:03.403 --> 05:06.031
You know, if it wasn't for you,

05:06.072 --> 05:08.506
I'd still be depending
on a public defender.

05:08.541 --> 05:11.635
Well, I told you not to
worry... it's only money.

05:11.678 --> 05:13.270
You know I'm paying you back.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.577
Well, you, uh, can
add it to the bill,

05:15.615 --> 05:17.640
because I'm buying
you a new suit today.

05:17.684 --> 05:18.810
We're going shopping.

05:18.851 --> 05:20.478
Whatever you say.

05:20.520 --> 05:22.317
You know, you're my miracle.

05:22.355 --> 05:23.344
Really?

05:23.389 --> 05:24.515
Yeah.

05:26.492 --> 05:27.857
Ready to go?

05:27.894 --> 05:29.953
Ooh, where's your gold braid?

05:30.063 --> 05:31.325
Nice suit.

05:31.364 --> 05:32.592
Well, thanks...
since we're dining

05:32.632 --> 05:34.759
with a bona fide blueblood,
I figured what the heck.

05:34.801 --> 05:36.462
Come on,
I'll take you home to change.

05:36.502 --> 05:37.969
I'm not changing.

05:38.004 --> 05:40.632
I told you, I don't want to make
a big deal out of this, okay?

05:40.673 --> 05:42.573
You're gonna dress like that?
The guy's a real prince.

05:42.608 --> 05:44.633
What? And that impresses you?
I mean...

05:44.677 --> 05:46.076
Yeah. Yeah, it does.

05:46.112 --> 05:48.876
It's actually one of the few
things that does impress me.

05:48.915 --> 05:51.383
I mean, he's a member
of a European dynasty, Clare.

05:51.417 --> 05:54.409
Well, all I remember about
Prince Carl was, uh,

05:54.454 --> 05:58.117
that he was a spoiled,
royal pain in the butt.

05:58.157 --> 05:59.385
And he probably still is.

05:59.425 --> 06:01.120
So how'd you guys get so close?

06:01.160 --> 06:02.593
Well, when I was about nine,

06:02.628 --> 06:05.222
we lived in Montmartre
for a couple of years.

06:05.264 --> 06:07.630
My dad was an economic
consultant there.

06:07.667 --> 06:10.192
My mom and his mom
were best friends,

06:10.236 --> 06:12.727
so we stayed with
the royal family.

06:12.772 --> 06:14.763
- Wow, sounds cozy.
- Unfortunately,

06:14.807 --> 06:17.105
uh, Carl and I were
around the same age,

06:17.143 --> 06:19.134
so we got to play together.

06:19.178 --> 06:21.169
Only his idea of playing

06:21.214 --> 06:24.809
was getting away with everything
and blaming me for it.

06:24.851 --> 06:27.342
Well, I'm sorry, but I am really
looking forward to this.

06:27.387 --> 06:28.945
Come on,
let's not be late,

06:29.055 --> 06:31.853
- shall we, princess?
- Mm.

06:34.427 --> 06:37.362
Keats, you'll have my column
by the end of the day.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.888
Thanks. By the way,
your friend's in the darkroom.

06:45.104 --> 06:46.435
- Kel?
- Nope.

06:48.207 --> 06:49.936
Tara.

06:49.976 --> 06:52.069
You, uh, changed your hair.

06:53.312 --> 06:55.337
Do you like it?

06:55.381 --> 06:57.349
Yeah. Yeah, it's nice.

06:57.383 --> 06:58.441
Good.

06:58.484 --> 07:01.385
Thank you so much
for getting me in here.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.820
No problem.

07:04.223 --> 07:06.521
What do you think?

07:06.559 --> 07:08.186
It's nice. Very natural.

07:08.227 --> 07:10.252
Kelly's really
beautiful, isn't she?

07:10.296 --> 07:12.355
One of the prettiest girls
I know.

07:12.398 --> 07:14.457
You know, she talks
about you all the time.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.468
Yeah, well, we're old friends.

07:16.502 --> 07:19.266
I don't mean like that.

07:19.305 --> 07:21.796
She's, um,
still in love with you.

07:23.509 --> 07:27.206
She says she'll
never get over you.

07:27.246 --> 07:28.941
You know, Tara,
I don't think you and I

07:29.048 --> 07:30.379
should be talking about this.

07:31.818 --> 07:32.876
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.254
What are you doing?

07:35.288 --> 07:37.347
I'm sorry.
I-I just wanted to see

07:37.390 --> 07:39.290
what it was like to be Kelly.

07:42.328 --> 07:43.590
Yeah.

07:43.629 --> 07:45.790
Well, uh...

07:45.832 --> 07:47.561
why don't we
just forget it, huh?

07:47.600 --> 07:48.965
You won't say
anything, will you?

07:49.068 --> 07:50.763
I mean, I just got carried away.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.964
No. No, don't worry about it.

07:55.274 --> 07:58.038
I'll see you later.

08:01.981 --> 08:03.881
There you go.

08:03.916 --> 08:07.443
Is it just me or is that girl
trying to impersonate Kelly?

08:07.487 --> 08:11.014
No, it's not just you...
she's, uh, she's crazy.

08:19.732 --> 08:21.063
Wow!

08:21.100 --> 08:22.692
A '60 Corvette.

08:22.735 --> 08:24.396
Someone's got good taste.

08:24.437 --> 08:25.927
Diplomatic license plate.

08:26.005 --> 08:27.939
Looks like Carl's
still spoiled rotten.

08:28.007 --> 08:29.736
Poor kid.

08:29.775 --> 08:31.265
Wow.

08:33.312 --> 08:34.506
- Hello?
- Clare?

08:34.547 --> 08:36.447
Steve! Oh, I'm glad you're here!

08:36.482 --> 08:38.143
Hi, Dad.
Is Carl here?

08:38.183 --> 08:39.275
Oh, yes.

08:39.318 --> 08:40.876
- And he's dying to see you.
- Hmm.

08:40.919 --> 08:42.888
Well, I'm certainly looking
forward to meeting him.

08:42.922 --> 08:44.753
Good. Come in, come in.

08:48.594 --> 08:50.391
Clare, little Clare.

08:50.429 --> 08:51.953
You're all grown up
and beautiful.

08:52.031 --> 08:54.124
Carl! Hi.

08:54.166 --> 08:57.829
Well, I guess you don't look
ten years old anymore, either.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.770
I am so glad we got this chance
to see each other

08:59.805 --> 09:02.638
- after all this time.
- Yeah, me, too.

09:02.675 --> 09:04.575
This is my boyfriend,
Steve Sanders.

09:04.610 --> 09:06.237
- Hi.
- Chancellor Arnold

09:06.279 --> 09:07.712
was just telling me
about you.

09:07.747 --> 09:09.908
I understand we share
a common interest, Steve.

09:09.982 --> 09:11.347
Well, I'm sure
more than just one.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.511
- I hear you drive a 'vette.
- I do, I do.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.316
I saw yours in the driveway...
it's beautiful.

09:15.354 --> 09:17.413
- Is it all original?
- Right down to the coil

09:17.456 --> 09:19.253
in the cigarette lighter...
and that still works.

09:19.292 --> 09:20.850
If you'd like, after dinner
I'll let you drive it.

09:20.893 --> 09:23.123
- I would love that.
- Why don't we move

09:23.162 --> 09:24.220
all this into the dining room?

09:24.263 --> 09:25.628
Good. I'm starved.

09:25.665 --> 09:26.689
Let's eat, huh?

09:26.732 --> 09:27.892
Sure.

09:29.468 --> 09:30.935
Hi. This is Kelly.

09:31.003 --> 09:33.198
I'm not in right now.
Please leave a message.

09:33.239 --> 09:34.536
Hi, Kel.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.633
Uh, God, I'm sorry
I got your machine.

09:36.676 --> 09:38.701
I was kind of hoping
I'd catch you.

09:38.744 --> 09:40.837
Uh, Tara came by
the darkroom today,

09:40.880 --> 09:42.848
and she seemed, uh, enthused,

09:42.882 --> 09:45.476
but, uh, there's something
I need to talk to you about,

09:45.518 --> 09:47.179
so give me a call, would you?

09:47.219 --> 09:48.709
All right, talk to you later.

09:48.754 --> 09:50.221
Brandon.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.951
- We're ready when you are.
- Yeah, I'm coming.

09:52.058 --> 09:54.652
- Ah. Sorry,
- guys.

09:54.694 --> 09:57.322
Okay, first,
I'd like to say Donna and I

09:57.363 --> 09:58.694
really appreciate you guys,

09:58.731 --> 10:00.198
uh, looking at this.

10:00.232 --> 10:02.063
Now, it's not
totally locked yet,

10:02.101 --> 10:03.898
so any input you might have

10:03.936 --> 10:05.836
on smoothing out, you know,
any rough edges,

10:05.871 --> 10:07.338
we'd really appreciate,
since we have

10:07.373 --> 10:08.806
our first pitch with it
tomorrow.

10:08.841 --> 10:10.968
Yeah, we just want to see
what works for you

10:11.077 --> 10:12.635
in the video
and what doesn't, okay?

10:12.678 --> 10:15.977
Of course, if you think it's
genius, you can tell us that.

10:16.082 --> 10:17.379
David, I think we
got the picture.

10:17.416 --> 10:18.747
You want to just roll the tape?

10:21.087 --> 10:22.520
Donna, could you get the lights?

10:22.555 --> 10:23.544
Got it.

10:25.725 --> 10:29.422
Without any further ado,

10:29.462 --> 10:33.455
I present Powerman 5000
with "Strike the Match."

11:47.973 --> 11:49.600
What's the matter?

11:49.642 --> 11:50.768
Uh, nothing.

11:50.810 --> 11:52.243
I'm just nervous.

11:52.278 --> 11:53.939
Yeah, tell me about it.

11:55.648 --> 11:58.378
You know, I really think
the beginning needs some work.

11:58.417 --> 12:00.282
Really? You know, I thought it
went over great.

12:00.319 --> 12:01.445
Well, how would you know?

12:01.487 --> 12:04.251
You were looking at Joe
the whole time.

12:04.290 --> 12:06.155
Well, do you think
we should go back in?

12:06.192 --> 12:07.454
Go ahead.

12:07.493 --> 12:09.085
I'm, I'm just gonna
hang out, out here.

12:09.128 --> 12:10.527
I don't want
to pressure anybody.

12:10.563 --> 12:11.860
Good idea.

12:11.897 --> 12:13.728
Yeah, we'll
just, we'll wait here.

12:33.085 --> 12:35.519
Yay.

12:36.455 --> 12:37.922
So?

12:37.957 --> 12:40.221
So? I can't believe you guys
put this together in a weekend.

12:40.259 --> 12:41.385
It's awesome!

12:41.427 --> 12:43.827
And I may be biased,
but I loved the fact

12:43.863 --> 12:46.798
that the woman has all the fire
and the men have to come to her.

12:46.832 --> 12:47.856
Oh, really?

12:47.900 --> 12:49.128
We should all be that lucky.

12:50.469 --> 12:54.235
Joe, what'd you think?

12:54.273 --> 12:57.606
Yeah, yeah, it's, uh...

12:57.643 --> 12:59.406
very professional-looking.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.413
Hey, Brandon, you mind
if I grab a drink?

13:01.447 --> 13:03.210
Yeah, yeah, man.
Help yourself.

13:06.152 --> 13:08.484
I'll be right back.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.519
So, you guys are
being way too nice.

13:12.558 --> 13:14.856
Tell me something about it
that sucked, please.

13:18.597 --> 13:20.656
Hey, what's wrong with you?

13:20.699 --> 13:22.496
Nothing's wrong.

13:23.836 --> 13:25.963
Well, you're, you're acting like

13:26.005 --> 13:28.974
I committed some kind of
cardinal sin or something.

13:29.074 --> 13:30.701
It's really hurting
my feelings.

13:30.743 --> 13:33.644
What if this thing
actually ends up on TV?

13:33.679 --> 13:36.239
How do you think that's
going to make me feel?

13:36.282 --> 13:38.648
You want my family to see you
dancing around half naked?

13:38.684 --> 13:40.083
But it's not me.

13:40.119 --> 13:41.916
I'm playing a character
and it's not that revealing.

13:41.954 --> 13:43.216
Is that what you want to be,

13:43.255 --> 13:45.223
a sex object?

13:45.257 --> 13:46.588
Aren't you just a little
bit embarrassed?

13:48.961 --> 13:53.955
Well, what, what do you
want me to do about it?

13:53.999 --> 13:55.125
I don't know.

13:56.402 --> 13:58.165
I think you've already
done enough.

14:07.479 --> 14:10.346
I cannot wait until
group therapy is over.

14:10.382 --> 14:11.815
No argument there.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.648
It's no longer the
highlight of my day.

14:13.686 --> 14:14.710
Do you want some tea?

14:14.753 --> 14:16.220
Sure. I'll be right back.

14:22.761 --> 14:24.490
Hi, Kel.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.896
Oh, God, I'm sorry
I got your machine.

14:26.932 --> 14:29.162
I was kind of hoping
I'd catch you.

14:29.201 --> 14:32.227
Tara came by the darkroom today
and she seemed enthused,

14:32.271 --> 14:34.967
but there's something I need
to talk to you about.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.507
So give me a call, would you?

14:36.542 --> 14:38.840
All right, talk to you later.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.368
Oh, no.

14:45.818 --> 14:48.116
Tara, all my fish are dead.

14:48.153 --> 14:49.279
Did you feed them?

14:49.321 --> 14:50.310
What?

14:50.356 --> 14:52.085
Of course.
Just like you said.

14:52.124 --> 14:54.615
- How much did you feed them?
- Just a little, I swear.

14:54.660 --> 14:56.321
Well, there is
a lot of extra food

14:56.362 --> 14:57.852
floating on the top of the tank.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.161
Are you accusing me
of killing your fish?

15:00.199 --> 15:02.667
I swear to God,
I would not do that.

15:02.701 --> 15:03.793
Then how did it get there?

15:03.836 --> 15:05.360
Go check the food container.

15:05.404 --> 15:06.462
I just used a little.

15:06.505 --> 15:08.405
Maybe it was a clogged
filter or something.

15:08.440 --> 15:10.670
How could you accuse me?

15:10.709 --> 15:12.540
I'm not accusing you, Tara.

15:12.578 --> 15:14.842
I just think that
it's time for you to move.

15:14.880 --> 15:16.472
This isn't fair.

15:16.515 --> 15:18.346
You're just upset because
your fish are dead.

15:18.384 --> 15:19.612
I understand.

15:19.652 --> 15:21.950
You need me, Kelly.
I'll stay here with you.

15:22.021 --> 15:25.388
No. You're not staying
here anymore, all right.

15:25.424 --> 15:26.823
Tomorrow, you're out.

15:41.507 --> 15:42.974
Is there any juice left?

15:43.075 --> 15:44.975
Uh, yeah, there should be.

15:45.044 --> 15:46.375
Wow, look at you.

15:46.412 --> 15:47.902
Got a date with a banker?

15:47.947 --> 15:49.972
Uh, not exactly.

15:50.049 --> 15:51.311
Colin's going to court
this morning.

15:51.350 --> 15:52.339
This is it.

15:52.384 --> 15:54.477
As in, face the music?

15:54.520 --> 15:55.953
Yeah, something like that.

15:55.988 --> 15:57.478
It's not going to be as bad
as it could have been.

15:57.523 --> 16:01.015
You know, Val, I hate to see
this guy take you down with him.

16:01.060 --> 16:03.255
I've got to go.

16:03.295 --> 16:05.923
Hey, Val, hang on a sec.

16:06.031 --> 16:07.760
I think I may know
who keyed your car.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.233
Really? Who?

16:09.268 --> 16:10.701
Well, it's just a hunch,

16:10.736 --> 16:12.499
but, uh, something tells me
Kelly's new roommate's

16:12.538 --> 16:14.028
got a couple of screws loose.

16:14.073 --> 16:16.598
And they say opposites attract.

16:19.845 --> 16:21.107
Come on, get up.

16:21.146 --> 16:22.841
You're gonna be
late for school.

16:22.881 --> 16:24.940
No, no, don't you remember?
We're cutting class today.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.248
I told Carl we were gonna
take him to the beach.

16:27.286 --> 16:29.049
I think Carl can probably find
the beach by himself,

16:29.088 --> 16:30.077
don't you think?

16:30.122 --> 16:31.680
Clare, that's not the point.

16:31.724 --> 16:33.749
I want to spend time with him
while he's here. He's cool.

16:33.792 --> 16:34.781
Yeah, right.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.351
You just want to kiss up to him,

16:36.395 --> 16:37.726
so you can get
your royal cufflinks.

16:37.763 --> 16:39.697
Royal cufflinks?

16:39.732 --> 16:42.530
You mean to tell me there, there
are actually royal cufflinks?

16:42.568 --> 16:45.230
Never mind.

16:45.270 --> 16:46.965
You know Carl
mentioned something

16:47.006 --> 16:49.099
about flying the two of us
over to Montmartre

16:49.141 --> 16:51.132
for that festival
this summer.

16:51.176 --> 16:53.110
You think he was serious?

16:53.145 --> 16:55.978
Knowing Carl, yeah.

16:56.048 --> 16:57.515
Yeah, huh?

16:57.549 --> 17:00.177
You got some pretty cool
friends, Arnold.

17:00.219 --> 17:01.777
Mm-hmm.

17:15.701 --> 17:18.192
Hey, Don.

17:18.237 --> 17:19.295
Hey, how's it going?

17:19.338 --> 17:20.498
Incredible.

17:20.539 --> 17:22.632
I incorporated some
of the notes from last night,

17:22.674 --> 17:24.767
and, honestly, I think we're
ready to master this puppy

17:24.810 --> 17:26.436
and start showing it
around for real.

17:26.478 --> 17:30.312
Yeah, well, actually,
I have a couple of notes.

17:30.349 --> 17:31.907
Oh, sure. Shoot.

17:31.950 --> 17:35.579
Okay, uh, at the
one minute-17 in,

17:35.621 --> 17:37.748
you know the high-angle
shot of me and the guys?

17:37.790 --> 17:39.087
Right.

17:39.124 --> 17:41.217
I think we should lose it
and just be on the band.

17:41.260 --> 17:42.727
And then at
one minute-37 in,

17:42.761 --> 17:44.854
instead of me and the matches,

17:44.897 --> 17:46.956
let's just be on Spider
for the lead vocal.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.090
Okay.

17:48.133 --> 17:49.395
And I just have one more note.

17:49.435 --> 17:51.369
At two-14 in,

17:51.403 --> 17:53.667
I think we should cut away
to each member of the group.

17:53.705 --> 17:55.366
You know, give
them more screen time.

17:55.407 --> 17:57.102
What do you think?

17:57.142 --> 17:58.939
Honestly?

17:58.977 --> 18:00.945
I think these are Joe's notes.

18:00.979 --> 18:03.777
No, they're, uh,

18:03.816 --> 18:05.306
they're Joe's and mine together.

18:05.350 --> 18:06.749
Well, I don't like them.

18:06.785 --> 18:08.343
I think they take away

18:08.387 --> 18:09.786
from the punch of the video.

18:09.822 --> 18:13.223
Wait, you took Brandon
and Susan's notes.

18:13.258 --> 18:15.123
Yeah, that's because
they made sense. These don't.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.923
Well, I'm sorry,
but I'm just feeling

18:16.995 --> 18:18.019
a little exploited here, okay?

18:18.063 --> 18:19.428
Donna, what are you
talking about?

18:19.465 --> 18:20.762
You were proud
of this yesterday.

18:20.799 --> 18:22.357
Yeah, well, I changed my mind.

18:22.401 --> 18:24.096
Look, I don't want to be

18:24.136 --> 18:26.001
a sex object in a music video.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.904
Look, will you do this
for me, please, David?

18:29.942 --> 18:31.409
No.

18:33.078 --> 18:34.568
I'm the director and, uh,

18:34.613 --> 18:36.308
I think I need to do
what's right.

18:36.348 --> 18:39.909
So you're saying that
you won't take my notes?

18:39.952 --> 18:41.613
Yep, that's what I'm saying.

18:41.653 --> 18:45.214
You know, I thought
this was a partnership.

18:45.257 --> 18:46.747
Either you do this

18:46.792 --> 18:49.784
for me or I will never work
with you again, okay?

19:04.443 --> 19:06.240
Please,
come to the beach with me.

19:06.278 --> 19:07.472
You'll feel better.

19:07.513 --> 19:09.708
I'll take some pictures
of you down by the surf.

19:09.748 --> 19:11.443
Tara, I'm fine.

19:11.483 --> 19:13.747
Why don't you go and leave
me alone for awhile.

19:13.785 --> 19:17.881
Okay, I understand.

19:17.923 --> 19:20.255
I just want you to know,
I'll do whatever you say,

19:20.292 --> 19:23.056
if you want me to move out,
I'll move out.

19:23.095 --> 19:25.791
Just please,
still be my friend.

19:25.831 --> 19:28.766
I am your friend, all right?

19:28.800 --> 19:30.028
Now go.

19:46.685 --> 19:48.880
Tara, how's it going?

19:48.921 --> 19:50.479
Brandon, not so good.

19:50.522 --> 19:51.819
Kelly's really upset.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.757
Something happened to her fish.

19:53.792 --> 19:56.955
I don't know, she thinks
I did it, but I didn't.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.690
Would you talk to her for me?

19:58.730 --> 20:01.358
Sure.

20:01.400 --> 20:04.062
Thank you, Brandon.

20:04.102 --> 20:06.263
You are a really, wonderful guy.

20:10.776 --> 20:13.677
Kel?

20:13.712 --> 20:16.340
Hey, I told you, you
didn't have to come by.

20:16.381 --> 20:17.473
Yeah, I did.

20:17.516 --> 20:18.983
How's it going?

20:19.017 --> 20:21.212
Well, she's moving out.

20:21.253 --> 20:22.811
You got her into
the boardinghouse?

20:22.854 --> 20:24.219
Yep.

20:24.256 --> 20:25.518
They're expecting her
this afternoon.

20:25.557 --> 20:27.184
But it's not gonna
be easy on her.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.284
She's a very emotional girl.

20:28.327 --> 20:30.261
Kelly, you've already gone

20:30.295 --> 20:32.923
way above and beyond the
call of duty on this one.

20:32.965 --> 20:34.796
Even your doctor said this
wasn't a healthy situation.

20:34.833 --> 20:35.959
It's got to stop.

20:36.001 --> 20:37.992
I know. It is.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.697
I just want to handle it right.

20:39.738 --> 20:41.968
Well, you want me to stay
and help you deal with it?

20:42.007 --> 20:44.737
No, no, I'm just going to put
all of her stuff in the car,

20:44.776 --> 20:46.334
and when she comes back
from the beach

20:46.378 --> 20:48.005
I'm not going to take "no"
for an answer.

20:48.046 --> 20:50.207
Well, it sounds like
you got it handled.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.375
I do.

20:51.416 --> 20:52.576
All right, call me, all right?

20:52.618 --> 20:54.017
'Cause I want to know
how it goes.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.018
- Okay.
- Okay.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.019
See you.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.282
Bye.

21:44.236 --> 21:45.601
"Dear Tara.

21:45.637 --> 21:47.764
"Your mom and I are
so concerned about you.

21:47.806 --> 21:49.865
"Why won't you call us?

21:49.908 --> 21:52.342
"In case you've lost it,
here's our new number again.

21:52.377 --> 21:56.143
"We'll do anything to help you.
We love you so very much.

21:56.181 --> 21:57.944
"Please, let us know
you're all right.

21:57.983 --> 21:59.780
Mom and Dad."

22:07.125 --> 22:09.286
This is not ridiculous, Clare.

22:09.328 --> 22:10.955
Steve and I could make
a tidy fortune

22:10.996 --> 22:12.429
exporting classic
Corvettes to Europe.

22:12.464 --> 22:14.159
All we need are
the classic 'vettes.

22:14.199 --> 22:15.325
Well, that's where
you come in.

22:15.367 --> 22:17.301
You could go to all
the local car shows.

22:17.336 --> 22:18.325
I could.

22:18.370 --> 22:19.462
I'll bankroll you.

22:19.504 --> 22:20.971
I must know 50
people back home

22:21.039 --> 22:22.734
that will be willing
to pay top dollar

22:22.774 --> 22:24.867
to drive a car like mine.

22:24.910 --> 22:27.378
We'll double our money
for very little effort.

22:27.412 --> 22:29.403
I like the way you think, Carl.

22:29.448 --> 22:30.881
Guys, can we please do something

22:30.916 --> 22:32.645
except talk about cars?

22:32.684 --> 22:33.673
Absolutely.

22:33.719 --> 22:34.686
Grab her feet, Steve.

22:34.720 --> 22:35.744
What are you do...? No!

22:35.787 --> 22:36.947
Let's throw her in!

22:36.988 --> 22:38.649
- No!
- One, two...

22:38.690 --> 22:39.657
No!

22:39.691 --> 22:40.658
three.

22:40.692 --> 22:41.716
Oh, Clare.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.352
- Oh, I hate you guys.
- Come on.

22:43.395 --> 22:44.987
Carl, you used to do this
to me all the time.

22:45.063 --> 22:46.189
We're sorry.

22:46.231 --> 22:48.290
You didn't really think
we'd throw you in, did you?

22:48.333 --> 22:49.960
Don't even talk to me, okay?

22:50.001 --> 22:51.161
- Come on.
- You're a traitor.

22:51.203 --> 22:52.192
Traitor.

22:52.237 --> 22:53.568
You guys want a hot dog?

22:53.605 --> 22:54.936
- I'm a little hungry.
- Yeah, sounds good.

22:54.973 --> 22:55.940
- Clare?
- No, I'm not hungry.

22:55.974 --> 22:57.100
Well, I'm gonna get you one

22:57.142 --> 22:58.905
because I know you're
gonna want to eat mine.

22:58.944 --> 23:00.434
See you.

23:02.214 --> 23:04.307
Well, you're just as plucky
as you always were, Clare.

23:04.349 --> 23:06.909
Steve's a fortunate man.

23:06.952 --> 23:09.921
Well, I must admit,
you're not as bad

23:09.955 --> 23:12.446
- as you used to be.
- You think so?

23:12.491 --> 23:15.619
Well, no, you're still
a little spoiled brat.

23:15.660 --> 23:17.218
But that's my job.

23:17.262 --> 23:18.957
And I do it very
well, don't I?

23:19.064 --> 23:21.294
Yeah, pathetically well.

23:21.333 --> 23:23.324
Well, I'll take
that as a compliment.

23:23.368 --> 23:24.835
You would.

23:26.371 --> 23:28.771
Your Honor, the defendant has
been before the bench twice

23:28.807 --> 23:30.274
before for this same crime.

23:30.308 --> 23:32.503
Crack dealing is not something
that should be taken lightly.

23:32.544 --> 23:33.977
What's going on?

23:34.012 --> 23:36.378
This is not the D.A.
we made the deal with.

23:36.415 --> 23:38.508
Relax. D.A.'s all talk
to each other.

23:38.550 --> 23:39.983
They pass the notes.

23:40.018 --> 23:41.679
We're all boxed in
on this case,

23:41.720 --> 23:42.982
no matter who the D.A. is.

23:43.021 --> 23:44.989
There's not a problem.

23:45.090 --> 23:48.651
Don't worry.
It's gonna be okay.

23:48.693 --> 23:49.921
I don't know.

23:49.961 --> 23:52.225
I have a lousy feeling
about this.

24:01.039 --> 24:02.836
I love living by the beach.

24:02.874 --> 24:05.274
I got some amazing shots
of the shorebirds.

24:05.310 --> 24:07.904
Tara...

24:07.946 --> 24:09.277
I know.
I have to leave.

24:09.314 --> 24:12.647
No, I want to talk
to you about something else.

24:12.684 --> 24:14.413
Sit down.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.250
Is this bad?

24:16.288 --> 24:17.653
No.

24:17.689 --> 24:21.887
No. Um, I called your parents

24:21.927 --> 24:23.292
a little while ago.

24:23.328 --> 24:26.786
What-what are you talking about,
you called my parents?

24:26.832 --> 24:29.357
How-how did you find out
about my parents?

24:31.336 --> 24:33.600
You went through my stuff?

24:33.638 --> 24:35.071
I'm sorry.

24:35.106 --> 24:38.166
I was moving your suitcase and
it opened and I saw the letters.

24:38.210 --> 24:40.075
You opened my suitcase?

24:40.111 --> 24:42.978
Tara, the important thing is,
is that they miss you so much.

24:43.014 --> 24:44.413
How could you do this to me?

24:44.449 --> 24:45.848
They want you to come home.

24:45.884 --> 24:46.908
No, they lie!

24:46.952 --> 24:49.512
All they have ever done
is lie to me. They hate me!

24:50.856 --> 24:52.824
They're gonna come after me.
They're gonna have me locked up.

24:52.858 --> 24:53.984
You are so stupid!

24:54.059 --> 24:55.890
Just calm down, all right?
Listen to me.

24:55.927 --> 24:57.258
No. You've ruined everything.

24:57.295 --> 24:59.229
Now you can't,
you can't ever be my friend.

24:59.264 --> 25:00.822
Yes, I can.

25:00.866 --> 25:02.356
No. How could you be
so ungrateful

25:02.400 --> 25:03.731
after everything I did for you?!

25:03.768 --> 25:05.099
I came on to,

25:05.136 --> 25:06.865
to Brandon for you, I keyed
Valerie's car for you,

25:06.905 --> 25:08.463
I got rid of Greg for you,

25:08.507 --> 25:10.134
and this is the way you return
the favor?

25:10.175 --> 25:11.642
Stop it, all right?

25:11.676 --> 25:13.143
Just stop.

25:13.178 --> 25:16.238
I'm gonna call Dr. Browning,
'cause you need to talk to her.

25:16.281 --> 25:17.680
Put down the phone.

25:17.716 --> 25:19.946
Tara.

25:19.985 --> 25:21.509
Do exactly as I say,

25:21.553 --> 25:23.487
or I swear to God,
I will kill myself.

25:23.522 --> 25:24.784
Please, don't.

25:24.823 --> 25:26.313
Don't do this, all right?

25:26.358 --> 25:27.620
I'll do whatever you want.

25:27.659 --> 25:29.559
Just put down the gun.

25:29.594 --> 25:30.822
Don't tell me what to do.

25:30.862 --> 25:31.851
See, I'm in control here.

25:31.897 --> 25:33.831
I am the one telling you
what to do!

25:33.865 --> 25:35.662
All right, all right, fine.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.003
What do you want to do?

26:04.262 --> 26:06.753
Where are we going?

26:06.798 --> 26:08.129
Just keep driving.

26:09.134 --> 26:11.602
It's a beautiful day, isn't it?

26:14.372 --> 26:17.102
Tara, please.

26:17.142 --> 26:18.234
You need help.

26:18.276 --> 26:20.836
That's why you're here.

26:20.879 --> 26:23.814
I just don't want
to see you hurt yourself.

26:23.848 --> 26:26.316
Kelly, I'm not gonna hurt
either one of us.

26:26.351 --> 26:28.751
That's not what this is about.

26:29.754 --> 26:32.348
Do you want
to listen to some music?

26:32.390 --> 26:34.915
No, no.
Let's talk, all right?

26:34.960 --> 26:37.190
Tell me about your parents.

26:37.228 --> 26:39.628
Just drive.

26:41.232 --> 26:42.665
Just drive.

26:53.378 --> 26:55.243
How do you plea
to these charges?

26:55.280 --> 26:57.248
Guilty, Your Honor.

26:57.282 --> 27:00.445
And you waive your right
to a speedy trial?

27:00.485 --> 27:01.952
Yes, Your Honor.

27:04.656 --> 27:06.214
What's the state's
recommendation?

27:06.257 --> 27:07.519
The state has reviewed the case

27:07.559 --> 27:09.823
and feels that
as a first-time offender

27:09.861 --> 27:10.828
and a productive citizen

27:10.862 --> 27:13.922
who poses no risk to society,

27:13.965 --> 27:15.899
the defendant should be remanded
to six months

27:15.934 --> 27:18.528
in a halfway facility
where he can maintain employment

27:18.570 --> 27:21.596
and keep his social
and family connections intact.

27:24.442 --> 27:25.909
No.

27:28.213 --> 27:30.306
I beg your pardon, your Honor?

27:30.348 --> 27:31.872
I said no.

27:31.916 --> 27:34.680
You and Mr. Crane may
have concocted this deal,

27:34.719 --> 27:36.118
but I'm not bound by it.

27:37.689 --> 27:39.589
This defendant put more than

27:39.624 --> 27:41.285
a dozen law enforcement
officers' lives at risk,

27:41.326 --> 27:43.794
as well as a countless number
of innocent citizens

27:43.828 --> 27:46.160
during a high-speed flight
from justice.

27:46.197 --> 27:49.758
And that's becoming all
too familiar in this town.

27:49.801 --> 27:52.895
It's time we sent a message.

27:52.937 --> 27:54.768
The defendant shall serve
a minimum two-year sentence

27:54.806 --> 27:57.104
in a state prison.

27:57.142 --> 27:59.167
Next case.

28:07.118 --> 28:08.415
This is good.

28:08.453 --> 28:10.284
I've been following
Powerman 5000 for a while now.

28:10.321 --> 28:12.915
I think this could
really help get 'em a deal.

28:12.957 --> 28:14.481
Yeah. Well, that's
what they're hoping.

28:14.526 --> 28:15.618
And as for you two,

28:15.660 --> 28:16.922
for what you must have made
this on,

28:16.995 --> 28:18.553
I got to say, I'd like to see
what you could do

28:18.596 --> 28:19.927
if you had some decent money
behind you.

28:19.964 --> 28:22.057
- Really?
- Well, this management company

28:22.100 --> 28:23.465
contracts
with music video producers

28:23.501 --> 28:24.798
like you guys all the time.

28:24.836 --> 28:26.701
The record companies foot
the bill,

28:26.738 --> 28:28.638
and we jointly control
in the creative process.

28:28.673 --> 28:30.140
So what you're saying is

28:30.175 --> 28:33.269
you might be able to get us in
on some of the other acts?

28:33.311 --> 28:35.211
Let me break it down for you.

28:35.246 --> 28:37.680
We use this video
to get PM-5K signed.

28:37.716 --> 28:38.910
If it swings some weight,

28:38.950 --> 28:43.887
MZA signs you guys
to a three-video contract.

28:43.922 --> 28:45.549
But like I said,

28:45.590 --> 28:47.615
we jointly share
the creative process.

28:47.659 --> 28:49.251
Which means?

28:49.294 --> 28:50.852
Well, this video is good,

28:50.895 --> 28:52.157
but it needs to be great.

28:52.197 --> 28:53.289
It's not quite ready yet.

28:53.331 --> 28:56.596
It needs to be hotter, sexier.

28:56.634 --> 28:58.363
You know what I mean?

28:58.403 --> 29:00.098
Something about it
is holding back.

29:00.138 --> 29:02.766
It needs more, um,

29:02.807 --> 29:04.775
needs more you.

29:07.779 --> 29:08.905
Yeah,

29:08.980 --> 29:12.040
that's, uh, that's
exactly what I think.

29:12.083 --> 29:15.018
Look, I have miles of outtakes.

29:15.053 --> 29:16.350
Just let me recut it.

29:16.387 --> 29:17.820
I have tons
of great stuff.

29:17.856 --> 29:19.016
How quickly
can you turn it around?

29:19.057 --> 29:20.854
I can bring it back tomorrow.

29:20.892 --> 29:21.916
Good.

29:22.026 --> 29:23.755
Great attitude.

29:23.795 --> 29:24.762
Great.

29:24.796 --> 29:25.763
See you tomorrow.

29:25.797 --> 29:26.764
Thanks.

29:26.798 --> 29:28.493
- Thanks. Bye.
- Bye.

29:33.204 --> 29:35.229
You know, you didn't even ask
my opinion, David.

29:35.273 --> 29:37.434
We probably shouldn't have
listened to Joe's changes

29:37.475 --> 29:38.703
in the first place.

29:38.743 --> 29:40.438
Come on. We both know
this guy's right.

29:40.478 --> 29:41.638
What, do you want
to just walk away

29:41.679 --> 29:42.703
from an opportunity like this?

29:42.747 --> 29:45.910
No.

29:45.950 --> 29:47.850
Let's do what we have to do.

29:50.121 --> 29:52.282
Pull over there.

29:53.825 --> 29:55.417
Whatever you say.

29:58.062 --> 30:00.758
Turn the car off.
We're here.

30:00.799 --> 30:03.131
What are we doing?

30:03.168 --> 30:05.363
I just want to rest.

30:05.403 --> 30:06.734
You know, kick back.

30:06.771 --> 30:09.604
Well, I don't feel very relaxed
with a gun in your hand.

30:09.641 --> 30:12.269
There's nothing to be scared of.

30:12.310 --> 30:14.938
People are gonna start worrying.

30:14.979 --> 30:16.674
They're gonna
come looking for me.

30:16.714 --> 30:18.705
There you go.
Always thinking of you.

30:18.750 --> 30:21.719
Who do you think
is gonna look for you?

30:21.753 --> 30:23.380
You got to be gone
at least 24 hours

30:23.421 --> 30:25.355
before you can even call
the cops.

30:25.390 --> 30:26.687
Tara, whatever game
you're playing,

30:26.724 --> 30:28.453
you're gonna
have to play it without me.

30:28.493 --> 30:30.484
This is where I get out.

30:30.528 --> 30:32.155
Don't you dare!

30:32.197 --> 30:33.391
Tara...

30:34.933 --> 30:36.457
I'm going.

30:36.501 --> 30:37.729
Kelly!

30:52.550 --> 30:55.713
Steve, come with me
for a second.

30:55.753 --> 30:56.811
Excuse us.

30:58.790 --> 31:00.382
It's no big deal, really,

31:00.425 --> 31:02.086
but, um, I thought
you might like these.

31:02.126 --> 31:04.094
Wow, cufflinks.

31:04.128 --> 31:05.095
What a surprise.

31:05.129 --> 31:07.495
Uh, what did I do
to deserve this?

31:07.532 --> 31:09.432
You've been so nice about
showing me around L.A.,

31:09.467 --> 31:11.094
I just wanted to show you
my appreciation.

31:12.470 --> 31:14.301
The insignia
is of the royal crest.

31:14.339 --> 31:17.638
They're beautiful.

31:17.675 --> 31:19.836
I'll be honored every
time you wear them.

31:22.247 --> 31:23.737
Are those what I think they are?

31:23.781 --> 31:25.112
I've arrived.

31:40.031 --> 31:43.228
You can scream all you want,
nobody's gonna hear you.

31:43.268 --> 31:45.600
Tara, why are you doing this?

31:45.637 --> 31:48.731
The sun's gonna go down
in a couple of hours.

31:48.773 --> 31:51.071
Isn't the view beautiful?

31:53.244 --> 31:55.178
Tara, you don't want to do this.

31:55.213 --> 31:58.410
I did a lot of reading
on suicide.

31:58.449 --> 31:59.916
There are so many ways,

31:59.951 --> 32:03.944
but I read that carbon monoxide
is the most gentle.

32:03.988 --> 32:07.947
I bought the hose,
found the location,

32:08.026 --> 32:10.961
I even measured your tailpipe.

32:10.995 --> 32:12.963
I've been planning this
for a long time.

32:12.997 --> 32:14.965
I don't want you to think
this is just because

32:14.999 --> 32:16.626
I got mad at you today.

32:16.668 --> 32:19.068
Please, you promised me you
wouldn't hurt yourself or me.

32:19.103 --> 32:21.401
You don't have to do this.

32:21.439 --> 32:23.066
This isn't gonna hurt.

32:23.107 --> 32:26.873
We'll watch the sunset,
and when the colors fade,

32:26.911 --> 32:29.971
I'll turn on the car.

32:30.014 --> 32:32.642
The carbon monoxide
will filter in.

32:32.684 --> 32:35.346
It'll be gradual.

32:35.386 --> 32:36.978
You'll get
a little lightheaded,

32:37.021 --> 32:40.650
and then we'll fall asleep.

32:40.692 --> 32:41.750
Friends forever.

32:41.793 --> 32:42.760
Tara!

32:42.794 --> 32:44.557
God, this isn't just for me!

32:44.595 --> 32:45.892
It's for you, too!

32:45.930 --> 32:48.592
Colin hurt you, Valerie...

32:48.633 --> 32:51.124
Brandon being
with another woman.

32:51.169 --> 32:53.467
There's just too much pain.

32:56.841 --> 33:00.470
Now let's just be quiet
for a little while,

33:00.511 --> 33:04.379
and in a couple hours...

33:04.415 --> 33:06.645
all the pain will be gone.

33:24.535 --> 33:26.969
Look...

33:27.071 --> 33:28.129
it's not over.

33:28.172 --> 33:29.833
You heard what Crane said.

33:29.874 --> 33:32.741
There's time to file
after-trial motions.

33:32.777 --> 33:35.871
Is this where you tell me
to face the music

33:35.913 --> 33:37.073
because it won't be that bad?

33:37.115 --> 33:38.844
I'm sorry.

33:38.883 --> 33:42.319
Yeah, that's easy
for you to say.

33:42.353 --> 33:44.617
I never should have listened
to you in the first place.

33:44.655 --> 33:48.147
Look, I know how you feel
and I don't blame you.

33:48.192 --> 33:49.420
But you have a week left

33:49.460 --> 33:51.291
before you have
to turn yourself in.

33:51.329 --> 33:55.163
Don't you think you should
make the best of it?

33:55.199 --> 33:59.329
You want me to cram two years
worth of living into one week?

33:59.370 --> 34:01.304
Is that what
you're suggesting?

34:01.339 --> 34:03.933
Because I can't do it.

34:04.008 --> 34:05.703
No one can.

34:06.978 --> 34:08.946
Don't! Don't!

34:09.813 --> 34:11.509
Two years, Valerie.

34:11.549 --> 34:13.915
Two years
in a state penitentiary.

34:13.951 --> 34:15.248
You know who my neighbors
are going to be?

34:15.286 --> 34:17.186
While you and your friends
are munching

34:17.221 --> 34:18.813
chopped salad,
I'll be picking cockroaches

34:18.856 --> 34:20.152
out of my oatmeal.

34:20.190 --> 34:21.179
Just let me talk to Crane.

34:21.225 --> 34:22.418
There's got to be

34:22.460 --> 34:24.428
something we can do,
I'll do anything.

34:24.462 --> 34:25.759
Wake up!

34:25.797 --> 34:27.822
Come on, it's over!

34:27.864 --> 34:29.389
The book is closed.

34:29.434 --> 34:30.799
Look, you can yell
at me all you want,

34:30.835 --> 34:33.565
but I am not leaving your side.

34:35.206 --> 34:36.639
Two years.

34:36.674 --> 34:38.437
Two years.

34:38.476 --> 34:41.467
How am I going to do it?

34:41.512 --> 34:43.172
How am I going
to get through this?

34:49.487 --> 34:52.614
Because you're strong.

34:52.657 --> 34:55.251
And because I need you
to come back to me.

35:00.364 --> 35:02.355
I can't.

35:06.003 --> 35:10.064
I don't think I can.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.769
You can.

35:12.977 --> 35:14.672
You can.

35:23.488 --> 35:24.614
Nat, come here.

35:24.655 --> 35:26.145
I want you to see this.

35:28.826 --> 35:30.123
Bing!

35:30.161 --> 35:31.185
Nice cufflinks.

35:31.229 --> 35:32.423
You got a shirt
to wear those with?

35:32.463 --> 35:33.953
Nice?
They're more than just nice.

35:34.065 --> 35:35.965
Take a good look at these.
You see that?

35:36.033 --> 35:37.295
That's a royal crest.

35:37.335 --> 35:39.565
These were given
to me by royalty.

35:39.604 --> 35:41.970
Oh, yeah. Clare's friend.

35:42.039 --> 35:43.802
Well, I always knew
you were a prince.

35:43.841 --> 35:45.638
That's not the point.

35:45.676 --> 35:47.507
These mean that I've been
accepted as a friend

35:47.545 --> 35:48.876
of the royal family.

35:48.913 --> 35:50.540
They don't give these
to just anybody, Nat.

35:50.581 --> 35:52.811
That's swell, Steve.

35:52.850 --> 35:54.215
May I go now?

35:54.252 --> 35:55.446
Well, wait till you meet

35:55.486 --> 35:56.578
Prince Carl.
He's a nice guy.

35:56.621 --> 35:57.713
He's coming over here
with Clare.

36:01.859 --> 36:03.292
Well, this is it.

36:03.327 --> 36:05.557
Where the elite meet to eat.

36:05.596 --> 36:07.826
Clare, wait, I want to talk
to you for a minute.

36:07.865 --> 36:09.298
Sure. What's up?

36:09.333 --> 36:12.928
I just wanted to tell you
how much fun I've been having

36:13.037 --> 36:14.902
and how wonderful it is
to see you again.

36:14.939 --> 36:17.134
Well, I'm glad
you're having fun.

36:17.175 --> 36:18.301
Steve and I are, too.

36:18.342 --> 36:20.333
You know, I came
to visit out of

36:20.378 --> 36:22.710
a sense of family obligation,

36:22.747 --> 36:25.238
but it's become much more.

36:25.283 --> 36:28.775
Well, that's sweet
of you to say.

36:28.819 --> 36:31.117
In fact, I think I'd
like to stay longer.

36:31.155 --> 36:33.953
I cleared it with my family,
it's all right with them.

36:33.991 --> 36:36.255
Especially because there's
some official business

36:36.294 --> 36:38.626
that I could look
after while I'm here.

36:38.663 --> 36:40.824
Oh, great.
I know Steve will be ecstatic.

36:40.865 --> 36:41.957
Good.

36:42.033 --> 36:43.796
But I wouldn't have
suggested it,

36:43.834 --> 36:45.267
unless it was
all right with you.

36:45.303 --> 36:48.067
It's all right with me.

36:48.105 --> 36:49.094
You're sure?

36:49.140 --> 36:51.074
Yeah, of course.

36:51.108 --> 36:53.338
I mean, you should stay
as long as you like.

36:53.377 --> 36:55.641
That's all I wanted to hear.

37:02.153 --> 37:03.620
Come on in.

37:05.556 --> 37:08.684
Hey, sorry I'm late.

37:08.726 --> 37:10.091
That's okay.

37:10.127 --> 37:11.355
How'd it go?

37:11.395 --> 37:13.124
Uh, great.

37:13.164 --> 37:15.894
Uh, looks like we just
have to make a couple changes,

37:15.933 --> 37:17.025
and they're going
to buy it.

37:17.068 --> 37:19.127
Probably hire us
to do some more, so...

37:19.170 --> 37:21.263
- Wow.
- So, how's it going?

37:21.305 --> 37:22.636
Good.

37:22.673 --> 37:24.698
I just want to get through
these exams.

37:25.710 --> 37:27.371
Yeah.

37:29.080 --> 37:32.277
Um... Joe, look,

37:32.316 --> 37:35.513
the changes that
they want us to make,

37:35.553 --> 37:40.115
it's, uh, it's all the stuff
that you wanted me to take out.

37:42.159 --> 37:45.617
And unless we put it back in,
they're not gonna buy it.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.900
Well, I guess that's show biz.

37:50.935 --> 37:53.802
I thought you'd be really upset.

37:53.838 --> 37:56.898
No.

37:56.941 --> 37:58.806
No, I've had some time
to think about it,

37:58.843 --> 38:02.870
and, uh, I'm actually
a little embarrassed

38:02.913 --> 38:05.108
how I handled things.

38:05.149 --> 38:06.616
When it comes right down to it,

38:06.651 --> 38:08.915
I think what
was really bugging me

38:09.020 --> 38:11.113
was how much time
you're spending with David.

38:11.155 --> 38:13.783
I'm jealous, Donna.

38:13.824 --> 38:17.590
You guys have things together
that you and I will never have.

38:17.628 --> 38:20.791
There's nothing
to be jealous of.

38:20.831 --> 38:23.664
My head knows that, but my
heart's not getting the message.

38:25.603 --> 38:29.334
Well, I could put my arms
around you right now,

38:29.373 --> 38:31.136
but I know that wouldn't
make a difference.

38:33.544 --> 38:35.136
You just have to believe me.

38:35.179 --> 38:36.407
Believe in us.

38:39.750 --> 38:42.685
How about if I put
my arms around you?

38:44.689 --> 38:47.954
That feels good.

38:48.059 --> 38:50.425
I never want
to own you, Donna.

38:50.461 --> 38:54.124
I always want you to be free
to have your own life.

38:54.165 --> 38:56.531
Is that your heart
talking or your head?

38:56.567 --> 38:59.502
It's definitely my heart.

38:59.537 --> 39:01.368
Well, thanks.

39:01.405 --> 39:03.396
That's important to me.

39:04.608 --> 39:06.599
And what was that?

39:06.644 --> 39:08.635
That'd be my stomach.

39:08.679 --> 39:10.078
You want to get
something to eat?

39:10.114 --> 39:11.604
Yeah.

39:20.725 --> 39:23.751
It's going to be better, Kelly.

39:23.794 --> 39:26.786
You understand that,
don't you?

39:26.831 --> 39:29.493
Uh-huh.

39:29.533 --> 39:31.296
And you're not mad at me?

39:32.503 --> 39:33.527
No.

39:33.571 --> 39:36.335
Good.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.399
I'm so glad.

39:38.442 --> 39:43.141
It's not like we're dying.

39:43.180 --> 39:44.807
It's like everyone else is.

39:44.849 --> 39:47.943
I know.

39:48.018 --> 39:49.713
And I'm glad, too.

39:51.689 --> 39:53.179
There's just one last thing.

39:53.224 --> 39:55.124
What is it?

39:55.159 --> 39:56.285
Untie me.

39:56.327 --> 39:57.589
Please, Tara,

39:57.628 --> 39:58.788
I don't want to die like this.

39:58.829 --> 40:00.888
You'll try to get away.

40:00.931 --> 40:02.228
No, I won't.

40:02.266 --> 40:03.665
I want to end my pain, too.

40:03.701 --> 40:05.635
You were right
about everything.

40:07.338 --> 40:09.966
You do, don't you?

40:10.074 --> 40:11.974
Yeah.

40:12.076 --> 40:15.307
I can't take it anymore.

40:15.346 --> 40:18.975
But I never would have had the
courage to do this without you.

40:20.885 --> 40:23.376
Thank you, Tara.

40:23.421 --> 40:24.786
Thank you for saving me.

40:26.524 --> 40:27.991
It's going to be so beautiful.

40:28.058 --> 40:31.050
It's gonna be
so much better.

40:55.953 --> 40:58.513
You lied to me!
You lied to me!

40:58.556 --> 41:00.023
Friends don't lie!

41:00.057 --> 41:02.958
Friends don't lie!

41:02.993 --> 41:05.120
Friends don't lie.

41:15.139 --> 41:16.436
So, how's the noggin?

41:16.474 --> 41:18.101
Oh, a little sore.

41:18.142 --> 41:19.336
You ready to go home?

41:19.376 --> 41:21.606
If I never see the inside
of another hospital,

41:21.645 --> 41:22.634
it will be too soon.

41:22.680 --> 41:23.874
I don't blame you
for that.

41:23.914 --> 41:25.643
Your mom and everyone's
waiting in the lobby.

41:27.418 --> 41:29.409
Where's Tara?

41:29.453 --> 41:31.216
She's in the psychiatric ward
under lock and key.

41:31.255 --> 41:32.244
Suicide watch.

41:32.289 --> 41:34.416
I want to see her.

41:34.458 --> 41:36.392
No, you don't.

41:36.427 --> 41:37.416
Yes, I do.

41:37.461 --> 41:38.655
I want this to be over.

41:38.696 --> 41:42.154
And if I see her,
it will be.

41:44.401 --> 41:46.528
Okay, this way.

42:04.388 --> 42:05.946
Excuse me.

42:06.056 --> 42:07.614
Do you know my daughter?

42:07.658 --> 42:08.647
Yes.

42:08.692 --> 42:09.852
I'm Kelly Taylor.

42:09.894 --> 42:11.953
I thought so.

42:12.062 --> 42:15.088
My husband and I
got in this morning.

42:15.132 --> 42:16.156
Thank you so much.

42:16.200 --> 42:17.758
How is she?

42:19.203 --> 42:21.535
Not well.

42:21.572 --> 42:24.132
But we're hopeful that
she'll be able to be transferred

42:24.174 --> 42:27.974
to a psychiatric hospital
in Colorado real soon.

42:28.012 --> 42:29.741
She wants to come home.

42:29.780 --> 42:31.748
That's wonderful.

42:31.782 --> 42:33.977
I'm so sorry that
you had to go through

42:34.051 --> 42:36.246
such a frightening ordeal.

42:36.287 --> 42:37.652
And so is Tara.

42:39.189 --> 42:41.851
Brandon, this is Tara's mom.

42:41.892 --> 42:44.952
- Hi.
- Hello.

42:44.995 --> 42:46.929
Doctor said she can't have
any visitors right now.

42:46.964 --> 42:47.953
You'll have to come back.

42:47.998 --> 42:49.693
Okay.

42:49.733 --> 42:51.564
She said you were a friend.

42:51.602 --> 42:53.297
And I tried to be.

42:53.337 --> 42:56.795
Kelly, we know she would've
died if it wasn't for you.

42:58.042 --> 43:00.010
Bless you.

43:11.488 --> 43:12.750
Good-bye.

43:12.790 --> 43:14.155
Good luck.

43:14.658 --> 43:16.421
How you doing?

43:16.460 --> 43:18.485
Good.
