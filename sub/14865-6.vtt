WEBVTT

01:59.620 --> 02:02.111
Where are the grain
provisioning figures?

02:02.248 --> 02:04.955
This can't be right.

02:13.426 --> 02:15.758
I've been talking with the men.

02:15.886 --> 02:19.014
They had no idea
Greece was so large.

02:19.140 --> 02:23.349
And they're sick of the endless
marching you put us through.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.308
We were plotting our revenge.

02:25.813 --> 02:27.314
We must find good ground.

02:27.440 --> 02:30.022
They're quite an amiable lot, really,
when you get to know them.

02:30.151 --> 02:33.018
Ravening potbellied whore scum.

02:33.154 --> 02:35.019
Let's hope they fight as well as they eat.

02:35.156 --> 02:37.522
If you will bury your nose
in quartermaster's accounts,

02:37.658 --> 02:40.365
you must expect to be gloomy.

02:40.494 --> 02:43.736
Look up, Cassius. Look around.

02:43.873 --> 02:46.956
Is it not wonderful?

02:47.084 --> 02:51.043
| see only 100,000 mouths to feed.

02:51.172 --> 02:53.754
You have no poetry in you, Cassius.

02:53.883 --> 02:56.169
We ride with these men to save the Republic.

02:56.302 --> 02:57.963
Yeah, well, sorry to be prosaic,

02:58.095 --> 03:01.713
before we do any saving of republics,
we have Octavian to defeat.

03:02.641 --> 03:04.302
Indeed.

03:17.615 --> 03:19.571
If we play this right,

03:19.700 --> 03:22.908
we can take Brutus
and Cassius by surprise.

03:26.499 --> 03:30.287
They will be expecting
to face only you and your troops.

03:30.419 --> 03:35.413
So when both our armies arrive in Greece
they will be trapped.

03:35.549 --> 03:38.382
And there will be
no time for them to flee.

03:45.101 --> 03:48.434
Do you understand what I'm saying,
or shall I speak more slowly?

03:48.562 --> 03:53.272
No, making use
of strategic surprise is obvious.

03:53.401 --> 03:55.767
To that end, there is a list
of the most prominent friends

03:55.903 --> 03:58.861
and supporters of Brutus
and Cassius left in Rome.

03:58.989 --> 04:01.480
We should kill them

04:01.617 --> 04:03.778
before they learn what we're about.

04:03.911 --> 04:07.199
You are a ferocious little cunt...

04:07.331 --> 04:08.366
with a pen.

04:08.499 --> 04:10.160
These are among
the finest men in Rome,

04:10.292 --> 04:11.623
some of them my good friends.

04:11.752 --> 04:14.368
Their money will be useful as well.

04:14.505 --> 04:16.917
General Antony, tell them.

04:21.095 --> 04:23.336
Cicero is the cleverest bastard of them all

04:23.472 --> 04:27.556
and he has the largest network of spies.
He must die first.

04:27.685 --> 04:31.098
There are one or two names
I'd like to add myself.

04:31.230 --> 04:32.811
I shall start back to Rome.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.272
|'|| muster my troops and
let it be known I intend to go east

04:35.401 --> 04:37.266
to confront Brutus and Cassius alone.

04:37.403 --> 04:41.362
Lepidus, you will remain
behind with a small force.

04:41.490 --> 04:43.651
Keep the peace in Rome after we've left.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.649
l'm pledged to agree with you.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.242
But I must say, these killings...

04:47.371 --> 04:51.740
Send the list ahead to Lucius Vorenus
at the Aventine collegium.

04:51.876 --> 04:55.835
Add instructions telling him
to divide the names among the gangs.

04:55.963 --> 04:58.045
l have a name while you're at it.

04:58.174 --> 05:00.756
Not Servilia. We cannot kill women.

05:00.885 --> 05:02.876
Not Servilia.

05:03.012 --> 05:05.549
— Rufus Tranquillus.
— Who?

05:05.681 --> 05:08.423
lsn't he father to Octavia's friend Jocasta?

05:09.018 --> 05:10.349
Why do you want him dead?

05:10.936 --> 05:14.144
I don't like the girl.
She's a bad influence.

05:14.273 --> 05:16.605
This is not a game, Mother.

05:16.734 --> 05:18.190
Her father is immensely rich.

05:18.319 --> 05:21.777
True. Stone quarries.

05:26.911 --> 05:29.493
Woe unto Rufus Tranquillus, then.

05:31.165 --> 05:33.372
Make sure Vorenus knows
that he and Titus Pullo

05:33.501 --> 05:35.742
should deal with Cicero personally.

05:35.878 --> 05:37.368
All right.

05:37.505 --> 05:39.496
Tell them...

05:39.632 --> 05:40.997
to cutoff his hands

05:41.133 --> 05:44.500
and nail them to the Senate door.

05:44.637 --> 05:48.095
I told the old fool I'd do it
if he ever crossed me again.

05:48.724 --> 05:51.841
Nobody can possibly say
that I don't keep my word.

06:06.742 --> 06:09.950
Goodbye, my love.
I shall miss you.

06:10.079 --> 06:13.446
We're forever saying goodbye.
It's becoming tiresome.

06:13.582 --> 06:17.325
One little campaign in Greece
and we shall never be parted again.

06:17.461 --> 06:20.077
— Do you mean that?
— Of course.

06:22.049 --> 06:24.256
That would make me very happy.

06:25.469 --> 06:29.758
When you return you must bring me
Brutus's head as a wedding present.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.881
Yes, a wedding.

06:33.143 --> 06:36.852
Yes, we must think about that
when | return.

06:36.981 --> 06:40.565
Now, don't keep your darling boy waiting.

06:40.693 --> 06:42.934
It's a long way back to Rome.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.232
And you be careful with Octavian.

06:46.365 --> 06:49.198
Of course. I know how to handle him.

06:49.326 --> 06:50.907
That's what I'm afraid of.

07:03.924 --> 07:06.916
There, see? Brings out your eyes.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.176
What are you doing?

07:12.766 --> 07:14.176
Wash that off at once.

07:14.310 --> 07:16.266
Yes, Father.

07:21.275 --> 07:23.982
What's the problem? A little blush.

07:24.111 --> 07:26.568
Paint yourself as you wish.

07:26.697 --> 07:28.403
You stay away from my daughter.

07:28.532 --> 07:32.400
Mascius, tell the collegia captains
we meet here today.

07:32.536 --> 07:34.868
Tell them it'll be
in their interest to attend.

07:34.997 --> 07:37.079
— Will do.
— Thanks.

07:40.461 --> 07:42.543
Standing up for me like that.

07:42.671 --> 07:45.663
Shut up. He's captain.
She's his daughter.

07:45.799 --> 07:48.666
He says don't paint her.
Don't fucking paint her.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.259
Spoken like a true third man.

07:54.058 --> 07:55.798
I like you.

07:55.934 --> 07:57.720
You know I do.

07:57.853 --> 08:00.435
But be careful, slave.

08:00.564 --> 08:02.395
l have my limits.

08:27.341 --> 08:29.707
Each of you's been given a list.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.550
On it are ten of the richest men in Rome.

08:32.680 --> 08:34.545
You've been given licence to kill them

08:34.682 --> 08:37.469
and are to take of theirs
what you and your men can carry.

08:37.601 --> 08:40.434
Licensed by who, you?

08:40.562 --> 08:42.098
By order of Octavian Caesar.

08:46.694 --> 08:49.026
What gives you the right
to decide who gets what?

08:49.154 --> 08:51.941
The list has been equally divided.
You all get your fair share.

08:52.074 --> 08:54.360
I've only got two senators.

08:55.285 --> 08:58.118
— Try to keep him out of the mud.
— I will, Father.

08:58.247 --> 09:01.660
— Cotta here's got six.
- Right!

09:01.792 --> 09:04.283
You got more equestrians.
lt balances out.

09:04.878 --> 09:05.867
It's the principle!

09:06.380 --> 09:08.086
Principle? What principle?

09:14.805 --> 09:17.387
Lucius, Lucius, stop right now.

09:18.684 --> 09:22.552
Lucius, get out of the mud. Lucius!

09:25.232 --> 09:27.848
Lucius, stop right now.
I swear I'll smack you so hard.

09:27.985 --> 09:30.897
Lucius, stop! Stop it!

09:35.075 --> 09:37.987
That's the one.

09:38.120 --> 09:40.907
I hope he dies roaring
with his knees in a knot.

09:47.254 --> 09:50.917
Excuse me, lady.
Is this the way to the temple of...

10:00.267 --> 10:02.599
You don't talk.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.611
There's more than enough
here for everyone.

10:19.995 --> 10:22.532
Close on 80 of the richest,

10:22.664 --> 10:25.701
noblest patricians
for you to murder and then rob.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.914
Which of you has ever seen
so much money for the taking?

10:30.047 --> 10:33.084
What shall we do with all this wealth?

10:35.594 --> 10:38.210
I'm serious. How shall
we spend this blood money?

10:38.347 --> 10:41.259
Slaves? Wine?

10:41.391 --> 10:42.801
Whores for the boys?

10:42.935 --> 10:45.517
We can assume you have a better idea.

10:45.646 --> 10:47.352
The Feast of Pomona is coming soon.

10:47.481 --> 10:49.813
It used to be that each collegium
would distribute

10:49.942 --> 10:51.603
fish and bread to the people.

10:51.735 --> 10:53.020
Why?

10:53.153 --> 10:54.438
As an offering to Pomona

10:54.571 --> 10:57.404
and as a gesture
of goodwill to the people.

10:57.533 --> 10:59.444
Yes, but why?

10:59.576 --> 11:02.113
The people eat fish. Then what?

11:02.246 --> 11:05.033
Then the people
will begin to see the collegia

11:05.165 --> 11:08.202
as more than purveyors
of violence and fear.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.496
But that is what we are.

11:12.381 --> 11:14.542
It used to be different.
It used to be,

11:14.675 --> 11:17.132
people would come
to the collegia for help,

11:17.261 --> 11:19.468
for justice, for money,

11:19.596 --> 11:22.212
for a marriage or a funeral
when they needed it,

11:22.349 --> 11:24.055
extra grain when the dole was short.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.971
What, we're gonna be
priests of Ceres now?

11:27.104 --> 11:30.141
Thank you for the history lesson,
but that was the old days.

11:30.274 --> 11:32.856
And nothing but war
and turmoil since then.

11:32.985 --> 11:35.226
— Things change, brother.
— They do, brother.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.772
They are changing now.

11:36.905 --> 11:39.647
Whoever wins
in Greece wins Rome.

11:39.783 --> 11:42.741
— Some kind of peace will follow.
- Suppose it does.

11:42.870 --> 11:44.826
Peace is no friend to men like us,

11:44.955 --> 11:47.071
men that thrive on blood and anarchy.

11:47.207 --> 11:53.203
The collegia must change
or they'll die.

11:53.338 --> 11:55.954
Suppose we don't want to change.

11:56.091 --> 12:00.175
Suppose we don't want
to waste good money on fish for beggars.

12:00.304 --> 12:02.215
I cannot force
any of you to be generous.

12:02.347 --> 12:06.056
However, the Aventine will be honouring
Pomona with fish and bread.

12:06.184 --> 12:07.640
You spend your money as you wish.

12:07.769 --> 12:10.260
Oh, I see. I see!

12:10.397 --> 12:12.763
Play the big man
and make us look bad.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.436
For that, you need no help from me.

12:14.568 --> 12:18.152
Vorenus, you're right.
You're right.

12:18.280 --> 12:20.441
It's a splendid idea.

12:20.574 --> 12:24.533
We shall be charitable. We shall be large.
Let us feed the people.

12:24.661 --> 12:26.743
By all means, goodwill.

13:28.266 --> 13:30.131
So...

13:30.268 --> 13:31.849
speak, brother.

13:31.979 --> 13:33.469
Why'd you back him?

13:33.605 --> 13:36.847
He's a man of vision, Cotta,
a man of vision.

13:36.984 --> 13:40.101
It's our duty as Romans to back him.

13:40.237 --> 13:42.444
- And?
— It's done.

13:51.999 --> 13:53.864
I don't trust that Memmio.

13:54.001 --> 13:57.835
— Too smooth by half.
- He bears watching.

13:57.963 --> 13:59.544
You'll take care of Cicero?

13:59.673 --> 14:01.629
He's at his villa in Tusculum.

14:01.758 --> 14:04.010
They want it done quick.

14:04.136 --> 14:07.845
— I'll get my kit and be off, then.
- No looting on this one.

14:07.973 --> 14:10.715
We'll show some respect.

14:10.851 --> 14:12.637
Right.

14:23.447 --> 14:24.857
Off out, are you?

14:28.702 --> 14:31.114
— Sharp.
— Don't touch that.

14:31.246 --> 14:33.737
— Where are you going?
— Not your business.

14:33.874 --> 14:38.664
— Just trying to be friendly.
— Look, love, I know your game.

14:39.963 --> 14:41.999
I don't want any part of it.

14:42.132 --> 14:44.088
Too bad.

14:47.679 --> 14:49.294
It's a good game.

14:54.936 --> 14:58.099
Go find yourself
some other fool to play with.

14:58.231 --> 14:59.892
If you ever change your mind...

15:05.572 --> 15:08.154
Don't flatter yourself. We're done.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.161
What did she want?

15:18.251 --> 15:19.206
Nothing.

15:19.336 --> 15:22.373
— You know her.
— Yes, I know her.

15:24.716 --> 15:26.456
Where are you going?

15:26.593 --> 15:29.630
Bit of work. Only for the day.

15:30.972 --> 15:32.712
Why don't you come along?

15:32.849 --> 15:35.261
lt's lovely country where I'm going.

15:36.186 --> 15:38.768
Vorenus, why don't we all go?

15:48.490 --> 15:49.570
Don't go.

15:50.492 --> 15:52.448
I'll be back before you know it.

15:55.372 --> 15:57.454
Save me some of that chicken, girls,

15:57.582 --> 15:59.789
or I'm eating Lucius when | get back.

16:01.586 --> 16:05.124
— Good luck.
— It's my middle name.

16:31.158 --> 16:33.069
Dominus.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.412
Speak, man, what news?

16:39.541 --> 16:42.829
I've just spoken
to someone in Antony's camp.

16:43.879 --> 16:45.335
And?

16:48.049 --> 16:51.291
I think your secrets will be safe with Hector.
Out with it.

17:27.047 --> 17:31.165
"My dear Brutus, | write
in haste with urgent news.

17:31.301 --> 17:33.917
"Octavian and Antony are reconciled.

17:34.054 --> 17:35.794
"Their two armies are united.

17:35.931 --> 17:38.343
"They plan to descend on Greece
and take you by surprise

17:38.475 --> 17:40.466
"with an ovenNhelming force."

17:41.895 --> 17:44.102
Dominus, armed men
are at the door!

17:44.231 --> 17:46.768
"You must retreat to Asia
before the trap is sprung."

17:46.900 --> 17:49.767
— You must run.
- No.

17:49.903 --> 17:51.518
Too late for that.

18:08.463 --> 18:12.126
On your life, you must get this letter to Brutus.
Understand?

18:12.259 --> 18:15.171
— On your life.
- Yes, sir.

18:15.303 --> 18:17.419
Master, you must save yourself.

18:19.099 --> 18:21.090
Show him the back way.

18:22.310 --> 18:24.426
Be quick!

18:27.857 --> 18:30.018
So are you Cicero, then?

18:35.323 --> 18:37.314
What is your name, young man?

18:38.034 --> 18:40.150
Titus Pullo, sir.

18:40.287 --> 18:41.618
Late of the 13th.

18:42.539 --> 18:46.498
The famous Titus Pullo. I am honoured.

18:48.295 --> 18:50.411
Likewise, honoured.

18:50.547 --> 18:53.129
Talk about famous.
Everyone's heard of Cicero.

18:54.467 --> 18:55.968
Yes.

18:56.094 --> 18:57.880
I dare say

18:58.013 --> 19:01.096
your work today
will earn you immortality.

19:01.683 --> 19:04.425
— How's that?
— I will be in all the history books.

19:04.561 --> 19:08.053
My killer's name,
no doubt, will live on also.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.431
My name.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.643
Thought you meant me.

19:16.156 --> 19:17.145
Good peaches.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.533
Yes, just getting ripe.

19:24.622 --> 19:26.533
There's no way...

19:26.666 --> 19:29.703
I can dissuade you from your task, I suppose?

19:31.421 --> 19:33.002
l have a great deal of money.

19:33.131 --> 19:35.918
No, sorry.

19:36.051 --> 19:38.542
Normally, I'd be tempted,
but you're far too important.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.511
Imagine the fuss.
| get back and I haven't done myjob.

19:41.639 --> 19:43.675
Go away!

19:45.185 --> 19:47.722
— Leave him alone.
- Give over.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.890
— Put your weapon down.
- Never.

19:50.023 --> 19:52.230
Don't mess about. I haven't got all day.

19:52.359 --> 19:54.645
Do as he says, Tyro.

19:54.778 --> 19:56.018
But, Dominus.

19:56.154 --> 19:58.736
Really, old friend,

19:58.865 --> 20:02.278
if you could see how absurd you look,

20:02.410 --> 20:03.911
you would not protest.

20:04.037 --> 20:06.494
Do as he says.

20:12.212 --> 20:13.167
Thank you.

20:13.296 --> 20:15.378
No, not yet.

20:16.841 --> 20:18.377
Please...

20:20.929 --> 20:23.545
give me a few moments.

20:24.224 --> 20:25.839
Whenever you're ready.

20:38.863 --> 20:40.819
Mind if I pick some peaches?

20:42.826 --> 20:44.032
What?

20:46.037 --> 20:47.538
Oh, yes...

20:49.541 --> 20:51.122
take what you want.

20:52.377 --> 20:53.742
Thank you.

20:53.878 --> 20:56.039
Nice present for the wife.

21:15.942 --> 21:17.853
All right.

21:20.363 --> 21:21.864
Now.

21:29.372 --> 21:31.454
Stop this at once!

21:33.460 --> 21:37.248
Resume your hideous wailing when I'm gone.

21:37.797 --> 21:40.413
Everything will be all right.

21:40.550 --> 21:43.292
You've been freed in my will.

21:45.013 --> 21:47.220
Take...

21:47.348 --> 21:50.761
Take care of my people.

21:52.270 --> 21:53.726
Yes, master.

21:55.315 --> 21:56.930
Goodbye.

22:12.624 --> 22:14.205
Easiest if you kneel.

22:34.020 --> 22:36.352
You might not want to watch this.

22:53.373 --> 22:55.830
— Such a beautiful girl.
— She is.

22:55.959 --> 22:58.371
I mean no disrespect,

22:58.503 --> 23:01.165
but it seems a shame
she'll never have a family of her own.

23:02.549 --> 23:04.540
It is. It is a shame.

23:05.593 --> 23:07.094
But she could...

23:07.220 --> 23:09.802
marry, if you would let her.

23:13.142 --> 23:15.133
I know Niobe would want it so.

23:15.270 --> 23:18.262
Niobe would only want her
married to a decent man.

23:18.398 --> 23:19.979
And no decent man would have her.

23:20.108 --> 23:21.723
We might try and find her one.

23:24.237 --> 23:27.104
What kind of man would marry a prostitute?

23:27.240 --> 23:29.526
No man that she deserves.

23:29.659 --> 23:32.617
- Lucius, stop!
— If she can't have a good man...

23:45.508 --> 23:48.215
Take better care of your brats, peasant.
I could have killed him!

23:48.344 --> 23:50.551
You stupid bastard,
you were riding too fast.

23:50.680 --> 23:53.638
Fuck you and your fucking mongrels.
Get out of my way.

23:56.686 --> 23:58.517
Vorenus, no!

23:58.646 --> 24:00.147
The children.

24:03.568 --> 24:05.229
Go.

24:06.237 --> 24:09.070
Go, get out of my sight.

24:13.286 --> 24:17.279
Get back to your game.
And you, stay out of this road.

24:38.519 --> 24:40.475
Anyone want some peaches?

24:53.618 --> 24:55.483
— Good day, was it?
— Very nice. Yours?

24:55.620 --> 24:57.076
No problem.

24:58.623 --> 25:00.579
He's not a bad fellow, that Cicero.

25:00.708 --> 25:02.915
Not stuck up, like you might think.

25:03.044 --> 25:05.000
Give one to your sister.

25:35.618 --> 25:38.906
More names from Mark Antony.

25:39.038 --> 25:42.030
- More?
— Antony has many enemies.

25:42.166 --> 25:44.031
It takes time to remember them all.

25:45.461 --> 25:47.372
Surely we have killed enough.

25:47.505 --> 25:49.291
Close on a thousand men.

25:49.424 --> 25:52.757
The troops need paying.
We have to get the money from somewhere.

25:52.885 --> 25:56.002
Agrippa has a point.
We should proceed more slowly.

25:57.515 --> 25:59.005
We do not want to...

26:00.017 --> 26:01.223
appear butchers.

26:01.352 --> 26:03.058
Certainly not.

26:08.651 --> 26:10.687
Excuse me.

26:10.820 --> 26:13.027
I need some air.

26:37.138 --> 26:40.221
— Long day?
- Very long.

26:42.143 --> 26:44.304
lt's tiring work, I imagine,

26:44.437 --> 26:48.476
killing people,
even defenceless ones.

26:48.608 --> 26:50.644
Most of them we shall let escape into exile.

26:50.777 --> 26:52.483
They will only lose money and land.

26:52.612 --> 26:55.524
Just ruined? That's all right, then.

26:55.656 --> 26:58.523
It's not pleasant work,
but it's necessary.

26:58.659 --> 27:01.071
For the good of the Republic.

27:01.204 --> 27:03.286
Exactly.

27:03.414 --> 27:06.952
— If you'd excuse me.
— No, wait.

27:07.084 --> 27:08.620
You've been avoiding me.

27:08.753 --> 27:10.994
— I thought it best.
— Why?

27:11.839 --> 27:13.420
To avoid any awkwardness.

27:14.634 --> 27:16.499
Awkward ness?

27:16.636 --> 27:18.046
| see.

27:18.179 --> 27:19.635
l was right, then.

27:20.807 --> 27:21.671
How so?

27:21.808 --> 27:23.969
I think if you did actually
love me as you said,

27:24.101 --> 27:26.308
you wouldn't mind
any amount of awkwardness.

27:27.313 --> 27:28.849
No, I'm glad to know the truth.

27:28.981 --> 27:32.314
Please, do not toy with me.

27:33.319 --> 27:35.184
You cannot have mistaken my sincerity.

27:35.321 --> 27:37.027
But to avoid awkwardness?

27:37.156 --> 27:40.694
I didn't speak to you because
I know my feelings for you are hopeless.

27:40.827 --> 27:42.943
But that's for me to say, isn't it?

27:43.830 --> 27:46.162
No. No, it's not.

27:48.167 --> 27:49.703
My father was a nobody.

27:49.836 --> 27:54.375
His father was a slave.
l have not a drop of good blood in me.

27:54.507 --> 27:56.543
So you have risen purely by merit.

27:56.676 --> 27:59.713
Surely that is commendable, in its way.

27:59.846 --> 28:02.713
You are sister
to Gaius Octavian Caesar.

28:02.849 --> 28:05.716
You'll not be married
to the commendable son of a nobody.

28:05.852 --> 28:08.218
— l'll marry who I like!
- No.

28:09.605 --> 28:11.015
No, you won't.

28:12.024 --> 28:15.858
You'll marry some useful nobleman
of your brother's choosing.

28:19.031 --> 28:22.273
— Octavia...
— Just leave me alone.

28:24.412 --> 28:26.027
I'm sorry.

28:28.583 --> 28:32.576
I've been torturing myself
these last months.

28:32.712 --> 28:36.580
I cannot... I cannot bear to...

28:36.716 --> 28:38.707
Don't.

28:50.438 --> 28:54.431
- Hello, Octavia.
— Maecenas, I came to see my brother.

28:55.484 --> 28:57.520
I'm sure he'll be very happy to see you.

28:59.071 --> 29:01.778
Agrippa, we can't find
the wretched blasted figures

29:01.908 --> 29:04.149
for the blasted tax projections.

29:04.285 --> 29:05.650
Yes.

29:07.580 --> 29:08.990
Lovely to see you again.

29:34.690 --> 29:39.309
It is no small sum we are asked to give.

29:39.445 --> 29:40.981
What guarantee is there

29:41.113 --> 29:43.900
that our money buys
the influence we seek?

29:44.033 --> 29:47.992
It is Herod's own agent
who makes this request of us.

29:48.120 --> 29:50.497
If our money can ensure

29:50.623 --> 29:53.706
that Rome recognises him
as King of Judea,

29:53.834 --> 29:57.668
Herod will be in our debt.
He acknowledges this himself.

29:57.797 --> 30:01.255
But who exactly
does he intend to bribe?

30:01.384 --> 30:04.467
Who knows who will be
master of Rome next month,

30:04.595 --> 30:06.301
leave alone next year?

30:06.430 --> 30:11.140
We will not disburse the money
until the conflict is settled.

30:12.603 --> 30:14.810
How has it come to this?

30:17.650 --> 30:19.641
In this holy place

30:21.153 --> 30:23.735
you conspire in bribery,

30:23.864 --> 30:27.231
so that idolaters can rule
over your own people.

30:27.368 --> 30:30.986
— Who do you think you are?
— Sit down, Moses.

30:31.122 --> 30:34.159
Would you have
the Seleucids rule Judea?

30:34.291 --> 30:35.997
Or the Ptolemys?

30:36.127 --> 30:38.539
Better one we know,
one we can work with.

30:38.671 --> 30:41.754
Why let any of them rule?
This is our land!

30:41.882 --> 30:45.466
You are traitors to your own kind.

30:45.594 --> 30:47.585
May Ha—Shem have mercy on all of you.

30:53.602 --> 30:56.469
Name yourselves.

30:56.605 --> 30:58.732
We are the sons of Arod,

30:58.858 --> 31:01.850
from the families of Manasseh.

31:01.986 --> 31:05.103
We are the wrath of Israel.

31:36.687 --> 31:38.097
Oh, Tevye.

31:38.230 --> 31:41.939
What joy it is
to have your strength at my side.

31:42.068 --> 31:44.559
I don't get it.
Roughing up the elders, no problem.

31:44.695 --> 31:47.152
— But where's the point in that?
— Zion is the point.

31:47.281 --> 31:49.067
We're redeeming the Kingdom of Zion.

31:49.200 --> 31:51.862
Remember, friends.
Remember who we are.

31:51.994 --> 31:53.655
We are the chosen people.

31:53.788 --> 31:56.621
Not slaves, not animals.
The chosen people.

31:56.749 --> 31:59.240
Make way. Make way there!

32:06.801 --> 32:08.632
Thank you.

32:08.761 --> 32:11.969
— Everybody eats today.
- Bless you, Vorenus.

32:12.098 --> 32:13.554
See?

32:13.682 --> 32:16.059
Orderly as you like.

32:16.185 --> 32:18.392
Yes, very nice.

32:20.272 --> 32:22.763
Octavian leaving today?

32:22.900 --> 32:26.188
— Winner takes all, you reckon?
-|reckon.

32:26.320 --> 32:28.436
Shame not to be there.

32:30.116 --> 32:32.107
Those days are behind us, brother.

32:32.243 --> 32:35.861
We've other concerns here.
There'll be peace soon, one way or another.

32:35.996 --> 32:38.954
A good thing, I suppose.

32:40.584 --> 32:42.085
But?

32:43.963 --> 32:46.625
You know how it goes
with me in peacetime.

32:47.967 --> 32:49.753
Violence is the only trade I know.

32:49.885 --> 32:52.968
Peace comes, and the collegia change,
as you say they must,

32:53.097 --> 32:54.962
I'll be on my arse again, won't I?

32:55.099 --> 32:58.341
Jobless, telling war stories
to the rest of the drunkards.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.593
No, it's different now.

33:00.729 --> 33:03.721
You and me,
we can do big things here.

33:05.860 --> 33:06.770
You will.

33:06.902 --> 33:08.893
You'll do big things.

33:10.489 --> 33:14.073
It's good to see you so happy
and full of purpose again. It is.

33:15.661 --> 33:18.152
But me, I don't know.

33:20.583 --> 33:23.791
You're second man in the Aventine.

33:24.879 --> 33:26.460
Second man.

33:27.256 --> 33:29.121
I can see it on my tombstone now.

33:29.258 --> 33:32.842
"Second man on the Aventine.
He handed out many fish."

33:33.846 --> 33:36.428
— Nothing wrong with handing out fish.
— No, no, no.

33:36.557 --> 33:40.141
Canny business, no doubt.
But it's not soldier's work, is it?

33:40.269 --> 33:41.975
I'm a soldier!

33:43.397 --> 33:45.479
Least I used to be.

34:00.372 --> 34:02.283
Second hour.

34:10.549 --> 34:12.505
Second hour.

34:39.662 --> 34:41.448
We should go.

34:46.252 --> 34:48.709
Third hour.

34:48.837 --> 34:50.543
Gods! That can't be right.

34:50.673 --> 34:53.710
— They're always right.
— Third hour.

34:53.842 --> 34:55.969
Blind, bawdy house slave.

34:56.095 --> 34:57.801
Always.

34:57.930 --> 35:00.842
Familiar with the species, are you?

35:00.975 --> 35:04.092
I'm an unchaste and sinful woman.

35:04.228 --> 35:07.846
— I thought you liked that about me.
— I'm sorry.

35:07.982 --> 35:10.940
— I have no right to be possessive.
— No.

35:11.944 --> 35:14.276
I like that about you.

35:29.878 --> 35:33.462
— Are you sure you're all right?
— I'll be fine.

35:33.590 --> 35:36.923
Once you're gone,
I'm sure I shall be fine.

35:37.886 --> 35:40.172
I really should go. I'm very late.

35:40.306 --> 35:42.046
Then go.

35:43.100 --> 35:45.307
— I don't want to leave you like this.
— Go!

36:20.804 --> 36:24.342
Everyone together! Together, I say!

36:31.398 --> 36:33.138
Octavian, please.

36:33.275 --> 36:35.266
If only for my sake, be good to Antony.

36:35.402 --> 36:36.733
I am pledged to it, Mother.

36:36.862 --> 36:39.649
He's an arrogant shit,
but he's a good and honest man.

36:39.782 --> 36:40.942
You need him.

36:41.075 --> 36:43.691
— You need each other.
- I'm aware, Mother.

36:43.827 --> 36:45.567
— Listen...
— Troops are assembling

36:45.704 --> 36:47.820
on the Field of Mars.
We must be away soon.

36:47.956 --> 36:49.912
— Where is Agrippa?
- I don't know.

36:50.042 --> 36:52.454
Saying goodbye
to some woman, I expect.

36:52.586 --> 36:55.248
He attends to several whores.

36:55.381 --> 36:57.042
Or one lover.

36:57.174 --> 36:59.540
- I don't know which.
— Be a friend to Antony.

36:59.676 --> 37:03.544
Don't be cold and superior, it will
only provoke him. It provokes everybody.

37:03.680 --> 37:06.262
We all know how clever you are.
No one needs reminding.

37:06.392 --> 37:07.381
Yes, Mother.

37:16.902 --> 37:17.937
I'm so sorry.

37:18.070 --> 37:20.903
Hot from a brothel bed on such a day?

37:21.031 --> 37:22.271
Shame on you, Agrippa.

37:22.408 --> 37:24.649
I assure you, nothing of the sort.

37:24.785 --> 37:28.448
I'm teasing you.
It's fine. We should go.

37:31.083 --> 37:32.823
Goodbye, Mother.

37:35.212 --> 37:36.793
Juno bless you.

37:37.464 --> 37:39.671
Thank the gods you haven't gone already.

37:39.800 --> 37:42.382
I'm sorry I'm late.
Women's troubles.

37:42.511 --> 37:45.548
Had to go to the temple,
the place was a madhouse.

37:45.681 --> 37:48.718
— I'm so glad I didn't miss you.
— Give me a kiss, sister.

37:48.851 --> 37:50.136
The men are waiting.

38:18.464 --> 38:19.829
FonNard!

38:30.142 --> 38:33.555
So now you can tell me all about Agrippa.

38:34.605 --> 38:36.220
Well, what about him?

38:37.357 --> 38:40.224
How long have you two been lovers?

38:40.360 --> 38:41.770
It's not true.

38:41.904 --> 38:45.897
Please, don't lie to your mother,
you know it's futile.

38:49.411 --> 38:51.322
How did you know?

38:52.831 --> 38:54.992
I didn't until now.

38:56.001 --> 38:56.911
You mustn't...

38:57.044 --> 38:59.660
You mustn't tell Octavian. Please!

38:59.796 --> 39:01.923
It's harmless enough, I suppose.

39:02.049 --> 39:05.462
Both you and Agrippa
have good reason to be discreet.

39:05.594 --> 39:07.550
You may as well enjoy yourself.

39:07.679 --> 39:08.543
Thank you.

39:08.680 --> 39:11.057
Just as long as you keep
your wits about you.

39:11.183 --> 39:14.346
Don't think you'll marry him someday
because it won't happen.

39:14.478 --> 39:15.843
I know.

39:15.979 --> 39:18.311
But I love him, Mother.

39:19.358 --> 39:20.768
I love him.

39:21.568 --> 39:24.856
Soft as cheese.
What am I gonna do with you?

39:26.156 --> 39:27.862
Help me!

39:28.450 --> 39:30.941
Gods, help me!

39:31.745 --> 39:33.326
Gods, help me!

39:33.455 --> 39:36.538
Please help me!
I beg you to help me.

39:36.667 --> 39:41.036
Jocasta, what's wrong?
What's happened to you?

39:41.171 --> 39:43.378
Men came in the night.

39:43.507 --> 39:45.623
All my family are dead.

39:45.759 --> 39:48.751
They killed them and took me away.

39:48.887 --> 39:52.471
— They have dishonoured me.
— You're safe now.

39:52.599 --> 39:54.931
Isn't she, Mother? We'll keep her safe.

39:56.186 --> 39:58.768
Of course. We'll protect you.

40:34.766 --> 40:37.758
Whole place stinks of fish, doesn't it?

40:38.770 --> 40:41.853
I don't mind. Reminds me of home.

40:44.776 --> 40:48.314
Liked fish, did they? Your lot?

40:48.447 --> 40:50.563
I didn't know that.

40:51.575 --> 40:54.658
We had a big lake. Deep.

40:55.245 --> 40:57.281
A lot of fish.

40:58.332 --> 41:00.038
What is the helmet for?

41:01.126 --> 41:02.627
Nothing.

41:03.837 --> 41:07.079
— Just thinking of old days, that's all.
- Old days?

41:07.215 --> 41:09.831
Not today.

41:09.968 --> 41:12.630
— Soldiers leaving.
— You mean me?

41:12.763 --> 41:16.130
Leaving with them? No.

41:16.266 --> 41:17.676
No.

41:18.769 --> 41:22.227
Well, it had crossed my mind, obviously.

41:24.274 --> 41:26.060
I'm in with the chiefs, aren't I?

41:26.193 --> 41:28.605
I mean, if I was to go back in now,

41:28.737 --> 41:31.820
I'd probably be first spear at least.
Legate even.

41:31.948 --> 41:35.031
Think about that, wife of a Iegate!
Talk about respect.

41:35.160 --> 41:36.866
And money.

41:37.954 --> 41:39.945
Probably buy a lake.

41:43.794 --> 41:45.876
It'd be a short campaign.

41:46.004 --> 41:48.040
Everyone says so.

41:54.221 --> 41:57.133
Sons of Dis, I was only talking!

41:57.265 --> 41:59.301
No call for blubbery.

42:05.357 --> 42:07.143
I'm "preglant".

42:09.528 --> 42:11.519
What?

42:11.655 --> 42:13.270
I'm "preglant"!

42:13.407 --> 42:15.113
— "Preglant"!
— Pregnant?

42:15.242 --> 42:17.483
Whatever you call it!

42:31.341 --> 42:33.252
What is that you've got there?

42:33.385 --> 42:35.922
You've been mooning over it the last hour.

42:37.055 --> 42:39.546
This is my father's signet ring.

42:40.600 --> 42:42.261
I received it from my mother.

42:42.394 --> 42:45.386
I remember it on his hand
when I was a boy.

42:48.066 --> 42:49.351
It's a good fit.

42:52.738 --> 42:55.730
Sir, word from the scouts.
The enemy is sighted.

42:55.866 --> 42:58.778
- At last!
— It's notjust Octavian, sir.

42:58.910 --> 43:01.287
— Mark Antony is with him.
- That's impossible!

43:01.413 --> 43:02.823
The Heron standard was seen.

43:02.956 --> 43:05.538
— How many legions?
— 19, it seems.

43:05.667 --> 43:07.658
To our 14.

43:10.005 --> 43:11.916
The worm turns.

43:13.759 --> 43:16.751
— How far away are they?
— A day's march.

43:17.929 --> 43:19.920
Muster the men. We must break camp

43:20.056 --> 43:22.217
and begin the retreat immediately.

43:22.350 --> 43:24.602
No, wait. Stop.

43:33.945 --> 43:36.857
Do nothing. We will not retreat.

43:36.990 --> 43:39.276
— Old friend, this isn't...
- No.

43:42.788 --> 43:44.949
No more running.

43:46.625 --> 43:49.162
We will meet them here tomorrow.

43:50.462 --> 43:52.828
If we win,

43:52.964 --> 43:55.546
all the more glory for us.

43:57.260 --> 43:59.546
And if we are to die,

44:00.597 --> 44:03.384
this is as good a place as any.

44:05.852 --> 44:08.434
'Tis in the hands of the gods now.

44:09.439 --> 44:12.226
We have the upper ground.

44:13.276 --> 44:15.528
As he says.

44:53.066 --> 44:55.148
Heavens, I entirely forgot!

44:55.277 --> 44:58.815
— Today is your birthday, isn't it?
- Is it?

44:58.947 --> 45:01.279
I believe you're right.

45:04.619 --> 45:07.076
Happy birthday.

45:07.205 --> 45:09.321
Sorry there's no cake.

45:09.457 --> 45:12.244
Next year.
You can bake me an extra big one.

45:12.377 --> 45:13.662
I shan't forget.

45:13.795 --> 45:16.537
No cinnamon. Makes me sneeze.

45:27.225 --> 45:28.601
If you need to urinate,

45:28.727 --> 45:30.558
now would be the time.

45:31.354 --> 45:33.265
I'm fine, thank you.

45:33.398 --> 45:35.354
You sure?

45:38.069 --> 45:39.809
Let us begin, then.

45:40.530 --> 45:41.906
Watch closely, boy.

45:43.825 --> 45:47.067
This is how history is made.

45:49.539 --> 45:50.574
Now...

45:51.249 --> 45:53.160
let's have some fun.

45:56.379 --> 45:59.337
Advance!

46:13.355 --> 46:16.017
Sorry, rude of me.

46:16.149 --> 46:18.390
Would you like the honour?

46:18.526 --> 46:21.313
No, no, you do it by all means.

46:22.364 --> 46:24.195
Thank you.

46:26.326 --> 46:29.284
Advance!

47:50.744 --> 47:53.201
What is happening? Do you know?

47:53.329 --> 47:55.365
No idea.

48:00.545 --> 48:03.252
On my command, follow me!

48:03.923 --> 48:05.049
Where are you going?

48:06.718 --> 48:09.425
When in doubt, attack!

48:11.431 --> 48:13.638
Standard on Antony!

48:24.652 --> 48:26.688
Go.

48:26.821 --> 48:28.106
Thank you.

48:28.239 --> 48:29.740
You two, on me.

48:29.866 --> 48:30.981
- Sir!
— Yes, sir!

49:09.447 --> 49:12.610
Sir, Antony's forces have broken the line.

49:13.368 --> 49:14.778
Our right flank is gone.

49:19.666 --> 49:20.576
Halt!

49:20.708 --> 49:22.323
Our right flank is gone.

49:22.460 --> 49:24.291
Send in the reserve cohort!

49:27.340 --> 49:29.501
Testudo!

49:50.321 --> 49:53.154
FonNard!

50:12.719 --> 50:14.550
Down.

50:16.431 --> 50:18.262
Cassius?

50:23.646 --> 50:24.897
Cassius?

50:25.940 --> 50:28.056
What happened?

50:28.193 --> 50:30.354
Not sure, to be honest.

50:31.362 --> 50:33.398
Hell of a birthday.

50:33.531 --> 50:34.611
Don't despair.

50:34.741 --> 50:37.403
- The day's not done yet.
— Sir, our centre is routed.

50:37.535 --> 50:41.369
We must fall back.
We must fall back immediately.

50:52.050 --> 50:54.712
I see. All right.

50:54.844 --> 50:57.301
Come, old friend, we have to move.

50:58.723 --> 51:00.805
Sir, we must go.

51:00.934 --> 51:03.016
Cassius?

51:09.567 --> 51:11.068
We must go.

51:38.721 --> 51:40.336
Sir.

51:44.519 --> 51:48.478
It has been an honour
and a pleasure leading you.

51:48.606 --> 51:51.643
I am sorry we could not do better.

51:51.776 --> 51:54.643
But you must look to yourselves now.

51:54.779 --> 51:57.942
— Save your skins.
— Sir...

52:03.121 --> 52:04.827
Give my best to my mother.

52:04.956 --> 52:06.446
Tell her...

52:15.049 --> 52:16.789
Tell her something suitable.

53:11.898 --> 53:14.981
Cohort, halt!

54:04.951 --> 54:07.988
Keep searching!
Put the dead on the pyre.

54:08.121 --> 54:09.736
Breathe deep, boy.

54:10.748 --> 54:12.454
The smell of victory.

54:12.583 --> 54:15.575
Smoke, shit and rotting flesh.

54:15.711 --> 54:18.839
- Beautiful, isn't it?
— What report, Agrippa?

54:18.965 --> 54:23.675
The body of Cassius has been found.
We're still searching for Brutus.

54:23.803 --> 54:25.293
Excellent.

54:26.139 --> 54:30.052
Have the head packed in salt
for transportation back to Rome.

54:31.102 --> 54:33.093
People appreciate...

54:33.229 --> 54:35.766
the little touches, I find.
