00:00.646 --> 00:02.146
Previously on Sanctuary...

00:02.447 --> 00:05.349
I promise to make you happy, Helen,

00:05.350 --> 00:07.151
for all eternity.

00:07.152 --> 00:08.519
John, let me help you
before you make things worse.

00:08.520 --> 00:10.354
And how is that possible?

00:10.355 --> 00:13.090
I've already murdered,
what, seven whores?

00:13.091 --> 00:14.592
It's amazing to me,

00:16.000 --> 00:22.074

00:27.101 --> 00:28.468
it's a modified EM bubble.

00:28.469 --> 00:30.370
It protects outside interference
from jamming devices.

00:30.371 --> 00:31.304
Is that what she told you it was for?

00:31.305 --> 00:32.205
What is it for?

00:32.206 --> 00:33.740
Me.

00:33.741 --> 00:35.275
Your mother did indeed
leave me close to death.

00:35.276 --> 00:36.610
Forgive me, John.

00:36.611 --> 00:38.578
Tesla found me, revived me,

00:38.579 --> 00:42.182
and the rage that
once fueled me is gone.

00:42.183 --> 00:44.050
Tesla may have shocked
you into your senses, John,

00:44.551 --> 00:45.785
but nobody becomes what you were

00:45.786 --> 00:47.220
without a predilection for killing.

00:47.221 --> 00:49.022
No doubt you'd return

00:49.023 --> 00:50.723
to your murderous habits one day.

00:50.724 --> 00:52.992
I wasn't asking you out on a date.

01:06.740 --> 01:08.241
You're doing a great job.

01:08.242 --> 01:10.510
Um, how do you say, "it's
all going to be okay"

01:10.511 --> 01:12.946
in Zulu?

01:15.516 --> 01:17.850
What she said.

01:17.851 --> 01:19.485
That's right, keep it light.

01:19.486 --> 01:20.653
They're already panicked enough

01:20.654 --> 01:22.155
without piiking up on our fears.

01:22.156 --> 01:23.990
Remember, they're empaths.
They feel what you're feeling.

01:23.991 --> 01:24.991
Neomycin?

01:24.992 --> 01:25.555
Yeah, a couple of the intakes

01:25.560 --> 01:26.993
have second-degree burns.

01:26.994 --> 01:28.495
Did you contact the mumbai Sanctuary?

01:28.496 --> 01:30.464
Told them the empaths are safe.

01:30.465 --> 01:32.132
Their ship, on the other hand...

01:32.133 --> 01:33.800
How's it looking?

01:33.801 --> 01:35.035
Yeah, not so good.

01:35.036 --> 01:37.571
Celine Dion should
start singing about now.

01:37.572 --> 01:40.006
Sorry. Disaster joke, not funny.

01:40.007 --> 01:41.041
What the hell is keeping him?

01:42.210 --> 01:43.710
Fire's spreading, smoke everywhere!

01:47.148 --> 01:49.015
It's okay, just come with me.

01:50.384 --> 01:51.485
The rest of the crew?

01:51.486 --> 01:52.486
Dead.

01:56.657 --> 01:57.657
One of the empaths is still missing.

01:57.658 --> 01:59.559
Did you check the sleeping quarters?

01:59.560 --> 02:00.594
Without detailed
knowledge of the vessel,

02:00.595 --> 02:02.262
arrivals can be tricky.

02:02.263 --> 02:03.363
I need a known destination...

02:03.364 --> 02:04.397
Yes.

02:04.398 --> 02:05.432
On my way.

02:05.433 --> 02:06.800
Just...

02:06.801 --> 02:09.202
be careful.

02:09.203 --> 02:11.238
Henry, any idea what
happened to the ship?

02:11.239 --> 02:12.706
Best guess?

02:12.707 --> 02:14.608
About two hours out of
Maputo, the boiler exploded,

02:14.609 --> 02:15.709
tore a hole in the hull.

02:15.710 --> 02:17.077
All right.

02:17.078 --> 02:18.445
I may need your help
bandaging the new intakes.

02:18.446 --> 02:20.747
Aw, yeah, come on, doc.

02:20.748 --> 02:22.215
You know about me and blood.

02:22.216 --> 02:23.817
All right, get the guest quarters ready.

02:23.818 --> 02:25.151
We're going to need a
few extra beds tonight.

02:25.152 --> 02:26.186
Check.

02:27.188 --> 02:29.389
Metal fragment in her abdomen!

02:29.390 --> 02:30.657
Dear God, her pulse is weak.

02:30.658 --> 02:32.192
Get her to the O.R.

02:32.193 --> 02:34.194
I need to operate immediately.

02:43.504 --> 02:44.671
John?

02:48.576 --> 02:50.677
It's quite a day.

02:53.281 --> 02:55.348
Thank you for answering my call.

02:57.518 --> 03:00.754
It seems business is
never finished with us,

03:00.755 --> 03:03.323
despite our losses.

03:03.324 --> 03:05.492
I'm just saying, I couldn't
have done it without you.

03:05.493 --> 03:07.193
Well, all hands on deck, hmm?

03:09.297 --> 03:11.598
Besides, I've missed this place.

03:11.599 --> 03:12.866
You know, vengeful killing sprees

03:12.867 --> 03:15.468
are good for the soul, but...

03:15.469 --> 03:16.670
There's no place like home.

03:19.106 --> 03:23.543
Quite a lot of
teleportation for one day.

03:23.544 --> 03:25.111
You feeling any worse for wear?

03:25.112 --> 03:28.315
Right as rain.

03:28.316 --> 03:30.250
In fact, I've...

03:30.251 --> 03:31.418
I've never felt better.

04:26.026 --> 04:27.859
I can't imagine what
would have happened to them

04:27.860 --> 04:29.494
had John not answered my call.

04:29.495 --> 04:31.096
There was no rescue craft

04:31.097 --> 04:32.564
close enough to have saved any of them.

04:35.401 --> 04:36.501
Lucky.

04:36.502 --> 04:37.703
That she is.

04:37.704 --> 04:39.538
One more centimeter to the right,

04:39.539 --> 04:41.373
and this would have lacerated
her descending aorta.

04:43.777 --> 04:44.810
Cardiac arrest.

04:44.811 --> 04:45.878
Dammit! Get the cart!

04:45.879 --> 04:46.679
One milligram epinephrine.

04:48.882 --> 04:50.516
One milligram epinephrine.

04:58.591 --> 04:59.792
Alive.

04:59.793 --> 05:00.793
For now.

05:00.794 --> 05:03.328
She's not out of the woods yet.

05:03.329 --> 05:04.963
Let's close her up.

05:04.964 --> 05:06.665
Hey, man, Kate needs your help

05:06.666 --> 05:08.500
with the intake database.

05:08.501 --> 05:09.668
Can't you do it?

05:09.669 --> 05:10.669
I tried,

05:10.670 --> 05:12.805
but it looks like the system's fried.

05:12.806 --> 05:14.339
Hey, I'm a little busy here.

05:14.340 --> 05:15.607
Whoa...

05:15.608 --> 05:17.109
Look, tell that to mumbai.

05:17.110 --> 05:19.411
They're screaming for our
rescue and recovery logs asap.

05:21.047 --> 05:23.048
Molly's primed for a charge.

05:23.049 --> 05:24.483
I can't exactly bail on her right now.

05:24.484 --> 05:26.351
Molly?

05:26.352 --> 05:29.455
Modified o-wave linear expeller.

05:29.456 --> 05:32.524
Doesn't that acronym spell "mole"?

05:33.760 --> 05:35.394
Molly's hotter.

05:36.529 --> 05:38.831
Dude, it's a weapon, not a woman.

05:38.832 --> 05:41.633
Hey, clearly you and I have
not dated the same girls.

05:41.634 --> 05:43.602
Okay, look, are you
going to do this thing,

05:43.603 --> 05:45.370
because...

05:45.371 --> 05:46.538
okay, fine. Yes. Fine.

05:46.539 --> 05:48.006
You're going to have to
take over for me, okay?

05:48.007 --> 05:49.374
Molly needs to be charged and assembled

05:49.375 --> 05:50.109
before the seams on the pulse magazine

05:50.110 --> 05:51.577
degrade.

05:51.578 --> 05:53.345
Whoa, you just made that up, right?

05:53.346 --> 05:54.646
That means nothing to me.

05:54.647 --> 05:56.348
All you got to do is open the stock,

05:56.349 --> 05:58.083
remove the power core and charge it,

05:58.084 --> 05:59.485
then you re-insert the power core

05:59.486 --> 06:00.519
back into the stock,

06:00.520 --> 06:02.921
you seal the magazine, vent the shaft,

06:02.922 --> 06:04.790
secure the laser sight,

06:04.791 --> 06:06.992
and presto.

06:06.993 --> 06:08.360
You realize you're talking to a guy

06:08.361 --> 06:09.862
who flunked Allen key, right?

06:09.863 --> 06:12.698
Relax. You'll be fine.

06:12.699 --> 06:14.833
Oh, don't overcharge the power core.

06:14.834 --> 06:16.668
You'll blow up the lab.

06:16.669 --> 06:20.539
Okay, so no pressure, then.

06:41.461 --> 06:42.795
You're welcome.

06:48.101 --> 06:51.703
I feel nothing for you people.

06:51.704 --> 06:53.071
It was a favor,

06:53.072 --> 06:55.774
a task, nothing more.

07:04.984 --> 07:07.686
What did you say?

07:23.436 --> 07:25.671
I urge you not to trifle with me.

07:31.044 --> 07:33.712
You should have said nothing.

07:33.713 --> 07:37.716
You should have left well enough alone.

07:40.820 --> 07:44.189
Why did you come to me?

07:51.831 --> 07:53.165
It's up to her now.

07:53.166 --> 07:55.033
We've done all we can.

07:55.034 --> 07:56.235
Recovery in the infirmary?

07:56.236 --> 07:57.603
I want her monitored until she's stable.

07:57.604 --> 07:59.137
Today could have gone
a lot worse than it did.

08:07.747 --> 08:11.016
Oh, I'm sorry. I don't speak Zulu.

08:17.190 --> 08:20.459
Nozipho, one of the other empaths.

08:20.460 --> 08:22.127
She's like you.

08:22.128 --> 08:23.595
You can't... you can't...

08:23.596 --> 08:24.596
you can't see her.

08:24.597 --> 08:27.466
Is she lost in the Sanctuary?

08:27.467 --> 08:29.735
Oh, God, I'm so sorry,
I don't understand.

08:29.736 --> 08:31.003
You can't... you can't...

08:31.004 --> 08:32.638
You can't...

08:32.639 --> 08:35.240
You can't sense her anymore.

08:35.241 --> 08:36.508
Oh, okay.

08:36.509 --> 08:38.243
Come with me.

08:38.244 --> 08:39.611
What did you do to this thing?

08:39.611 --> 08:41.480
Oh, come o so now it's my fault?

08:41.481 --> 08:43.715
Well, I'm just saying, you see this?

08:43.716 --> 08:45.017
Who designed the database?

08:45.018 --> 08:46.084
It is not the database.

08:46.085 --> 08:48.120
Yeah, says you.

08:48.121 --> 08:49.755
Are you...

08:49.756 --> 08:50.856
Who does this?

08:50.857 --> 08:51.957
What?

08:51.958 --> 08:53.058
Okay, what is this?

08:53.059 --> 08:54.092
I use my computer.

08:54.093 --> 08:55.227
What is this?

08:55.228 --> 08:56.895
Ah, the craven throng?

08:56.896 --> 08:58.497
It's experimental garage acid.

08:58.498 --> 08:59.798
Oh, come on, you're telling me

08:59.799 --> 09:01.667
that my music screwed up your database?

09:01.668 --> 09:02.768
Your freeware media player

09:02.769 --> 09:04.870
created a conflict in
the com port access.

09:04.871 --> 09:06.271
Why is it whenever you talk,

09:06.272 --> 09:06.972
all i hear is, "blah, blah, blah, blah?"

09:06.973 --> 09:09.141
I did not create this

09:09.142 --> 09:10.208
to be your personal stereo system, okay?

09:10.209 --> 09:11.843
I...

09:11.844 --> 09:13.478
Is that...

09:19.886 --> 09:21.019
Whoa!

09:21.020 --> 09:22.721
Oh...

09:24.657 --> 09:25.791
Blood's fresh,

09:25.792 --> 09:27.926
20, maybe 30 minutes.

09:27.927 --> 09:30.595
Her throat's been cut.

09:30.596 --> 09:31.663
Henry,

09:31.664 --> 09:33.598
get the security camera footage.

09:33.599 --> 09:34.800
I want to know everyone
who was on this floor

09:34.801 --> 09:35.867
in the last half hour.

09:35.868 --> 09:38.470
All right, you got it.

09:38.471 --> 09:39.538
Kate, gather our guests.

09:39.539 --> 09:40.505
I don't get it.

09:40.506 --> 09:42.207
These guys are so gentle.

09:42.208 --> 09:43.575
They're no threat to anybody.

09:43.576 --> 09:45.143
Exactly.

09:45.144 --> 09:48.480
They're the perfect target.

09:54.287 --> 09:56.621
Beautiful...

09:56.622 --> 09:58.523
Isn't it?

09:58.524 --> 10:00.158
Turn around

10:00.159 --> 10:02.894
very slowly.

10:07.867 --> 10:09.067
How long?

10:09.068 --> 10:10.135
Long enough.

10:10.136 --> 10:13.005
Habits are...

10:13.006 --> 10:14.139
Hard to break.

10:14.140 --> 10:17.009
Perhaps you're not trying hard enough.

10:17.010 --> 10:20.112
I am who i am.

10:22.281 --> 10:25.717
It's high time you
did something about it.

10:28.254 --> 10:30.155
John!

10:43.169 --> 10:46.204
I take it the EM shields are up.

10:55.548 --> 10:56.715
Indeed.

11:03.589 --> 11:04.856
Doc! I heard shots.

11:04.857 --> 11:06.224
Kate!

11:42.662 --> 11:43.929
Is he...

11:46.599 --> 11:48.900
He's dead.

11:57.032 --> 11:58.299
Tell me again

11:58.300 --> 11:59.467
why you're trying to
bring a homicidal maniac

11:59.468 --> 12:00.534
back to life.

12:00.535 --> 12:02.871
It's more about compulsion than murder.

12:02.872 --> 12:05.440
I set him up for this,
letting him loose on the Cabal.

12:05.441 --> 12:07.041
He knew I'd find out
about his activities

12:07.042 --> 12:08.543
sooner or later.

12:08.544 --> 12:10.311
He wanted me to kill him.

12:10.312 --> 12:11.746
No offense,

12:11.747 --> 12:13.348
but you guys got a seriously
messe d-up relationship.

12:13.349 --> 12:14.983
It's complicated.

12:14.984 --> 12:16.017
Charge the defibrillator.

12:16.018 --> 12:17.886
Second button there to 200,

12:17.887 --> 12:19.988
and clear!

12:22.925 --> 12:23.892
Nothing.

12:23.893 --> 12:25.260
300.

12:27.496 --> 12:28.930
Clear!

12:32.334 --> 12:33.201
360.

12:34.403 --> 12:36.871
Clear!

12:39.241 --> 12:40.542
Oh, what the hell?

12:42.244 --> 12:43.778
Uh, Henry?

12:43.779 --> 12:44.913
I'm downstairs. The
lights are flickering.

12:44.914 --> 12:46.314
Yeah, i know, i know.

12:51.954 --> 12:53.054
We took a power surge.

12:53.055 --> 12:54.122
He's breathing again.

12:58.427 --> 13:00.595
The infirmary. We got a problem.

13:00.596 --> 13:02.230
The empath on oxygen, Musa.

13:02.231 --> 13:03.264
She's gone offline.

13:03.265 --> 13:05.333
We have to get her back here. Will...

13:05.334 --> 13:06.834
Bring the patient from the infirmary

13:06.835 --> 13:07.902
to the o.r. Now.

13:07.903 --> 13:09.103
On it.

13:09.104 --> 13:10.338
Doc, i need to do a major system reboot.

13:10.339 --> 13:11.205
Can you live without your med servers

13:11.206 --> 13:12.407
for a few nanoseconds?

13:12.408 --> 13:14.309
Do it.

13:15.311 --> 13:17.078
We need to check for any breaches

13:17.079 --> 13:18.479
in abnormal containment.

13:18.480 --> 13:19.914
We won't have full security

13:19.915 --> 13:21.349
until Henry's reboot is complete.

13:21.350 --> 13:23.885
Y-you're cool hanging
with Jack the ripper?

13:23.886 --> 13:26.254
He's no danger to anyone right now.

13:35.598 --> 13:36.965
Helen...

13:39.168 --> 13:41.336
I don't know why...

13:45.874 --> 13:47.408
I feel so strange.

13:51.480 --> 13:56.084
I know you wanted this
to end more quickly.

13:56.085 --> 13:57.518
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

14:00.289 --> 14:02.256
Why did you bring me back?

14:12.434 --> 14:13.935
Main server's coming back online now.

14:13.936 --> 14:16.204
I'm going to head to the o.r.
And check on the bio-techs.

14:16.205 --> 14:18.172
Keep me posted.

14:23.012 --> 14:25.179
The EM shield is at full strength.

14:25.180 --> 14:27.348
Attempt to teleport, and you will die.

14:27.349 --> 14:29.584
I understand.

14:29.585 --> 14:32.020
This is my fault, John.

14:32.021 --> 14:33.021
I should never have believed

14:33.022 --> 14:34.522
that you could change,

14:34.523 --> 14:36.591
that you had changed.

14:38.961 --> 14:41.095
How many have there been since...

14:41.096 --> 14:43.197
Since you let me back in?

14:43.198 --> 14:45.633
Does it matter?

14:45.634 --> 14:47.635
You've been killing again,

14:47.636 --> 14:48.936
and not just Cabal remnants.

14:50.673 --> 14:53.107
Does it matter that I never
wanted it to begin again,

14:53.108 --> 14:54.242
that i tried to stop?

14:54.243 --> 14:56.010
Helen, I tried.

14:57.212 --> 14:59.681
This is Whitechapel all over again.

15:07.222 --> 15:08.589
You're going to be okay.

15:08.590 --> 15:11.092
You're going to be okay. I'm
going to get you to the O.R.

15:14.697 --> 15:16.297
Your lungs are hurt, but
you're going to be okay.

15:21.003 --> 15:23.137
It's going to be okay.
You need to put this on.

15:23.138 --> 15:24.372
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

15:24.373 --> 15:26.174
I'm sorry. I'll get you to Dr. Magnus.

15:26.175 --> 15:27.508
She'll understand you.

15:27.509 --> 15:28.476
You're going to be fine, okay?

15:28.477 --> 15:29.410
I'm going to get you going.

15:29.411 --> 15:31.679
I don't speak any Zulu, I'm sorry.

15:37.419 --> 15:38.786
So was I right?

15:38.787 --> 15:40.288
You think the boss still has the hots

15:40.289 --> 15:43.791
for tall, bald and deadly?

15:43.792 --> 15:46.360
Man, I thought I had
relationship issues.

15:46.361 --> 15:47.762
What about you, big guy?

15:47.763 --> 15:49.630
Anyone special in your life?

15:49.631 --> 15:51.833
I mate every five years.

15:51.834 --> 15:53.468
With who?

15:53.469 --> 15:55.036
Hey, what the hell happened?

15:55.037 --> 15:56.037
Someone plug the microwave
and the toaster in

15:56.038 --> 15:57.205
at the same time?

15:57.206 --> 15:58.439
You got me.

15:58.440 --> 16:00.608
I'm still trying to get
all systems back online.

16:00.609 --> 16:01.542
How's she doing?

16:01.543 --> 16:02.577
Her life support is fried.

16:02.578 --> 16:04.545
She's on back-up.

16:04.546 --> 16:06.781
Magnus wants to keep her close.

16:08.283 --> 16:11.085
All right, we are back up
and firing on all cylinders.

16:11.086 --> 16:13.121
Now, tell me, who's your daddy?

16:16.492 --> 16:19.560
I'm going to go check
on the other patients.

16:19.561 --> 16:21.162
What?

16:23.332 --> 16:24.465
I'm arranging for your transfer

16:24.466 --> 16:27.135
to a secure facility out of the country.

16:27.136 --> 16:29.337
You are far too dangerous
to ever be free again.

16:48.624 --> 16:50.091
What happened now?

16:50.092 --> 16:51.159
Uh...

16:59.668 --> 17:01.736
Stopped.

17:01.737 --> 17:03.504
Great.

17:22.804 --> 17:23.538
Seriously?

17:24.540 --> 17:25.640
Hello!

17:25.641 --> 17:27.175
I know, I know,

17:27.175 --> 17:28.877
we're in auto lockdown!

17:28.878 --> 17:30.211
I'm getting an override going now.

17:31.514 --> 17:32.814
Oh, come on!

17:32.815 --> 17:34.349
Will, this is not good...

17:34.350 --> 17:35.650
Henry.

17:35.651 --> 17:36.751
Oh, man.

17:36.752 --> 17:37.685
Okay, uh...

17:37.686 --> 17:39.287
What was her name again?

17:39.288 --> 17:40.488
Magnus said something like... bosa.

17:41.657 --> 17:43.224
Mm, antlers... Musa!

17:43.225 --> 17:44.459
Musa! Musa, okay.

17:44.460 --> 17:46.694
So just talk to her and calm her down.

17:46.695 --> 17:47.829
It's very important.

17:47.830 --> 17:48.696
Okay.

17:48.697 --> 17:50.832
Uh, hey, Musa...

17:50.833 --> 17:52.200
Hi.

17:53.569 --> 17:55.303
Uh...

17:58.607 --> 18:00.642
What?

18:00.643 --> 18:01.809
No signal?

18:01.810 --> 18:02.944
Since when?

18:02.945 --> 18:06.281
Something's jamming it.

18:06.282 --> 18:08.950
Aw, come on.

18:13.589 --> 18:16.524
Agh, this is nuts.

18:16.525 --> 18:18.927
Stop doing that.

18:18.928 --> 18:20.528
Don't you guys update
your safety equipment?

18:20.529 --> 18:21.563
Constantly.

18:21.564 --> 18:22.764
Yeah, well, then,

18:22.765 --> 18:23.965
why isn't anything working?

18:23.966 --> 18:25.433
Where's the disembodied voice saying,

18:25.434 --> 18:26.868
"chill out. Help's coming?"

18:29.305 --> 18:30.405
I'm that voice.

18:32.007 --> 18:33.308
Is help coming?

18:33.309 --> 18:34.742
No.

18:34.743 --> 18:36.377
This shouldn't be happening.

18:39.682 --> 18:43.017
Hey, can we go out the top,

18:43.018 --> 18:44.352
climb up to the next floor?

18:44.353 --> 18:45.687
Yes, we can, but we're not going to.

18:45.688 --> 18:47.488
Not safe.

18:47.489 --> 18:49.891
Okay, biggie,

18:49.892 --> 18:52.293
this whole
speaking-in-code thing

18:52.294 --> 18:53.995
is really not working for me.

18:53.996 --> 18:55.697
Something's wrong.

18:55.698 --> 18:58.366
Need to know what before
we do anything rash.

19:00.903 --> 19:02.470
Yeah, wouldn't want to do that.

19:04.440 --> 19:05.540
Oh...

19:05.541 --> 19:08.376
That is some old-school radio shack.

19:08.377 --> 19:10.411
Is that an original phone system?

19:10.412 --> 19:11.779
From when this wing was built.

19:11.780 --> 19:13.081
Looks like it hasn't been used in years.

19:13.082 --> 19:14.983
It hasn't.

19:14.984 --> 19:17.418
Do you really think it's going to work?

19:17.419 --> 19:19.354
If you stop talking.

19:31.700 --> 19:35.903
Stay exactly where you are.

19:35.904 --> 19:39.674
Will, come in.

19:39.675 --> 19:40.875
Henry?

19:46.382 --> 19:47.515
Helen...

19:47.516 --> 19:49.751
Do not even think about teleporting.

19:49.752 --> 19:51.819
The EM shield stays active

19:51.820 --> 19:52.954
in lockdown mode.

19:52.955 --> 19:54.022
I have no intention of escaping.

19:54.023 --> 19:54.956
Really?

19:54.957 --> 19:56.457
I will answer for my actions.

19:56.458 --> 19:57.792
Don't try me, John.

19:57.793 --> 20:00.428
I'm quite serious, Helen.

20:00.429 --> 20:02.497
Something has changed.

20:02.498 --> 20:03.931
Stop!

20:03.932 --> 20:05.433
If you'll let me, I'd like to help.

20:05.434 --> 20:07.001
Stop talking.

20:09.004 --> 20:11.639
On your knees, hands
where i can see them.

20:16.512 --> 20:17.712
Better?

20:19.381 --> 20:21.082
Okay, just sit tight.

20:21.083 --> 20:22.850
We're going to get some help.

20:22.851 --> 20:24.185
Dude, I need help in here.

20:24.186 --> 20:25.753
Yeah, I know, but you
got to get me in the room.

20:25.754 --> 20:27.388
Yeah, I know.

20:28.457 --> 20:30.058
What the hell is going on?

20:30.059 --> 20:31.492
Dude, I'm completely shut out.

20:31.493 --> 20:32.493
This is very serious.

20:32.494 --> 20:33.795
Come on.

20:33.796 --> 20:35.129
I've tried every override command I can.

20:35.130 --> 20:36.931
Will...

20:36.932 --> 20:38.399
I have no control.

20:38.400 --> 20:39.434
What about the, uh...

20:41.170 --> 20:42.737
Hello?

20:42.738 --> 20:43.771
Check?

20:43.772 --> 20:44.739
Nothing?

20:44.740 --> 20:46.841
I got nothing.

20:46.842 --> 20:48.076
Oh, Will!

20:48.077 --> 20:49.410
Yeah, I know.

20:49.411 --> 20:51.913
Hang on.

20:51.914 --> 20:53.648
Magnus?

20:54.717 --> 20:55.750
Kate?

20:56.852 --> 20:58.486
Anyone!

20:59.555 --> 21:01.989
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

21:01.990 --> 21:05.660
Hey, surveillance feed.

21:05.661 --> 21:08.730
There.

21:15.003 --> 21:17.071
Will somebody please tell me

21:17.072 --> 21:18.172
what the hell is going on here?

21:22.611 --> 21:23.811
"Gunama," what's that mean?

21:23.812 --> 21:25.680
They were saying
before. It means "dark."

21:27.015 --> 21:28.149
Wow...

21:28.150 --> 21:29.517
I had no idea you were a techno whiz.

21:31.987 --> 21:33.488
Don't know why.

21:35.557 --> 21:37.759
So how old is this building?

21:37.760 --> 21:39.727
Elevator was new when I moved in.

21:39.728 --> 21:41.496
When was that, 1950?

21:41.497 --> 21:43.998
'51.

21:43.999 --> 21:45.166
Here, hold this.

21:50.472 --> 21:51.539
Hello.

21:52.775 --> 21:54.208
Hello!

21:54.209 --> 21:56.544
Big guy?

21:56.545 --> 21:57.879
Where are you?

21:57.880 --> 21:59.247
In an elevator.

21:59.248 --> 22:01.682
No, i know, but where are you?

22:01.683 --> 22:02.784
Will...

22:02.785 --> 22:05.686
It's the original
room-to-room intercom.

22:05.687 --> 22:08.189
Man, I can't believe
that thing still works.

22:11.560 --> 22:12.560
Hello?

22:13.529 --> 22:14.662
Hey!

22:14.663 --> 22:15.696
Hey!

22:15.697 --> 22:16.697
What's going on?

22:16.698 --> 22:18.166
The phones are dead. Nothing works.

22:18.167 --> 22:20.134
Yeah, I know.

22:20.135 --> 22:22.537
Henry's locked in the or with a patient.

22:22.538 --> 22:24.038
I'm stuck on med level.

22:24.039 --> 22:27.108
We've gone into some
weird lockdown mode.

22:27.109 --> 22:28.476
What for?

22:28.477 --> 22:29.710
Well, I was hoping you could tell me.

22:29.711 --> 22:31.813
Well, something's going down.

22:31.814 --> 22:33.514
Still, it shouldn't kill the phones,

22:33.515 --> 22:34.882
or lock us out of the computers.

22:36.685 --> 22:37.952
At least I can see you.

22:37.953 --> 22:40.755
You're on the surveillance cam.

22:40.756 --> 22:42.490
Magnus is locked in with druitt.

22:42.491 --> 22:43.591
Is she all right?

22:43.592 --> 22:44.625
Yeah, she's fine.

22:44.626 --> 22:47.261
He seems quiet for now.

22:47.262 --> 22:48.429
W... w... wait.

22:48.430 --> 22:50.498
If audio's down, why
is video still running?

22:50.499 --> 22:51.899
I mean, shouldn't everything be fubar?

22:51.900 --> 22:53.167
Why am I talking to you

22:53.168 --> 22:54.635
on the oldest intercom ever made?

22:54.636 --> 22:56.204
Good point.

22:56.205 --> 22:57.505
Look, can you connect with anybody?

22:57.506 --> 22:58.673
We need some help down here.

22:58.674 --> 23:01.209
All right, I'll give it a shot.

23:09.551 --> 23:10.885
We good?

23:13.589 --> 23:14.622
We're still locked out.

23:14.623 --> 23:16.724
Oh, come on.

23:16.725 --> 23:19.594
This really is none of my doing.

23:19.595 --> 23:20.928
Otherwise, why would I still be here?

23:20.929 --> 23:23.297
Accidental or not,

23:23.298 --> 23:25.533
i will shoot you if you give me reason.

23:25.534 --> 23:27.235
That is very clear.

23:30.672 --> 23:32.974
None of this makes any sense.

23:32.975 --> 23:34.942
Lockdown shouldn't cut
off our communications

23:34.943 --> 23:37.812
or jam our radio and phone signals.

23:37.813 --> 23:39.714
Henry's overrides must not be working.

23:39.715 --> 23:41.148
Helen, I know there's no good time,

23:41.149 --> 23:42.817
but I need you to understand something.

23:44.786 --> 23:46.187
What is this?

23:47.756 --> 23:52.159
It's as if a part of
me has been severed.

23:53.795 --> 23:54.929
Can anybody hear me?

23:54.930 --> 23:56.163
Yes, I can. Where are you?

23:56.164 --> 23:58.633
Elevator.

23:58.634 --> 24:00.668
There's been a malfunction
in the security system.

24:00.669 --> 24:02.069
I need assistance.

24:02.070 --> 24:03.938
Not the only one.

24:03.939 --> 24:05.640
No, no.

24:05.641 --> 24:07.708
Try that one, the black wire.

24:09.278 --> 24:10.311
Henry?

24:10.312 --> 24:13.247
Will? Found her.

24:13.248 --> 24:15.583
All right, boost the signal if you can.

24:15.584 --> 24:16.684
You're connected.

24:16.685 --> 24:17.618
Magnus, we got a patient

24:17.619 --> 24:19.787
in major distress here.

24:19.788 --> 24:20.955
Where are you?

24:20.956 --> 24:21.956
In the O.R. with Henry. It's Musa.

24:21.957 --> 24:23.457
She's having a seizure.

24:23.458 --> 24:24.926
Doc, her heart rate is rapid,

24:24.927 --> 24:26.093
but her blood pressure's really low.

24:26.094 --> 24:28.129
I don't know enough
about her physiology.

24:28.130 --> 24:29.297
How do we proceed?

24:29.298 --> 24:31.632
First priority, stop the seizure.

24:31.633 --> 24:32.767
Can you find a vial of diazepam?

24:32.768 --> 24:34.368
Uh, yeah, yeah.

24:34.369 --> 24:36.737
Back cabinets, bottom left.

24:36.738 --> 24:38.706
Two milligrams in an
IV. Can you set that up?

24:38.707 --> 24:40.341
Yeah, we're on it.

24:40.342 --> 24:42.276
Good. Let me know when
that's up and running.

24:42.277 --> 24:43.344
All right.

24:43.345 --> 24:45.112
It should calm her convulsions.

24:45.113 --> 24:46.213
Uh, yeah, okay.

24:46.214 --> 24:49.250
I'm doing it now.

24:50.786 --> 24:51.953
Oh, boy.

24:55.123 --> 24:57.291
So, what the hell happened?

24:57.292 --> 24:58.693
I've already tried everything i can

24:58.694 --> 25:00.061
from a remote terminal.

25:00.062 --> 25:01.162
This isn't a glitch, believe me.

25:01.163 --> 25:02.897
We're locked out on purpose.

25:02.898 --> 25:04.765
You know, we're all
cut off from each other,

25:04.766 --> 25:06.100
but there's elements
from the security system

25:06.101 --> 25:07.234
that are still active.

25:07.235 --> 25:08.636
It's got to be a targeted attack.

25:08.637 --> 25:09.770
No. No way.

25:09.771 --> 25:11.005
Since we got hacked,

25:11.006 --> 25:12.506
our remote security protocols all have

25:12.507 --> 25:13.841
triple redundancies now,
it's totally not possible.

25:13.842 --> 25:15.643
And no perimeter breach
detected, no data theft,

25:15.644 --> 25:16.911
and these odd power fluctuations?

25:16.912 --> 25:18.279
Yeah, I know.

25:18.280 --> 25:19.380
None of it matches the patterns

25:19.381 --> 25:20.948
of a remote hack.

25:20.949 --> 25:22.883
And yet we're all at
a perfect disadvantage.

25:22.884 --> 25:24.885
Okay, so we got hit by something.

25:24.886 --> 25:26.454
Any theories on how to undo it?

25:26.455 --> 25:27.922
You know, this all started

25:27.923 --> 25:29.824
right after Henry
rebooted the entire system.

25:29.825 --> 25:30.858
Everything was fine, and then...

25:30.859 --> 25:32.059
the system overloaded.

25:32.060 --> 25:33.160
It must've damaged
the automated commands

25:33.161 --> 25:34.662
running the Sanctuary.

25:34.663 --> 25:36.397
All the security cameras are working,

25:36.398 --> 25:40.067
but i can't get into a
system that i created.

25:40.068 --> 25:41.802
It's like someone's running all this

25:41.803 --> 25:43.437
in real time.

25:43.438 --> 25:45.673
You think somebody's controlling things

25:45.674 --> 25:47.208
from inside the building?

25:47.209 --> 25:49.043
Yeah, one of the abnormals we rescued?

25:49.044 --> 25:50.478
Impossible.

25:50.479 --> 25:52.847
They're here seeking asylum,
and it's not their way.

25:52.848 --> 25:53.848
Helen...

25:55.317 --> 25:56.417
When you revived me...

25:57.686 --> 25:59.387
The overload.

25:59.388 --> 26:00.321
A massive energy surge.

26:00.322 --> 26:02.023
Yeah, but from what?

26:02.024 --> 26:02.990
I feel different.

26:02.991 --> 26:04.992
I feel...

26:04.993 --> 26:08.095
Purged, purified.

26:08.096 --> 26:10.331
It came from you.

26:10.332 --> 26:12.299
I think so.

26:12.300 --> 26:14.335
How's Musa doing?

26:14.336 --> 26:16.237
Uh, well, the convulsions have stopped.

26:16.238 --> 26:17.738
She seems to be stabilizing.

26:17.739 --> 26:19.340
Good.

26:19.341 --> 26:22.777
Henry, take the defib paddles
and charge them to maximum.

26:22.778 --> 26:25.212
All right.

26:29.317 --> 26:30.651
Okay, Max power, ready.

26:30.652 --> 26:33.354
Juice the electrical panel.

27:00.115 --> 27:01.916
Something just came out...

27:01.917 --> 27:03.217
What the hell was that?

27:03.218 --> 27:05.352
It's not anyone inside the building,

27:05.353 --> 27:06.854
it's the building itself.

27:06.855 --> 27:08.489
What does that mean?

27:08.490 --> 27:12.093
That something very much alive
is in control of the Sanctuary.

27:19.926 --> 27:22.894
What, like as in an electrical being?

27:22.895 --> 27:24.062
This one appears sentient,

27:24.063 --> 27:25.530
even natively intelligent.

27:25.531 --> 27:26.598
It's found a way

27:26.599 --> 27:27.933
to cut us all off from each other.

27:27.934 --> 27:28.934
The fluctuations.

27:28.935 --> 27:30.602
It's testing its new environment.

27:30.603 --> 27:31.770
Exactly, and it won't be long

27:31.771 --> 27:33.505
before it has full control.

27:33.506 --> 27:34.806
Okay, time out.

27:34.807 --> 27:36.942
Are you guys sure this thing is hostile?

27:36.943 --> 27:38.110
It's a trapped creature.

27:38.111 --> 27:39.511
Maybe it'll just...

27:39.512 --> 27:42.848
I don't know, hang out and chill.

27:42.849 --> 27:43.849
It's violent,

27:43.850 --> 27:45.884
remorseless, relentless.

27:45.885 --> 27:48.420
It won't give up ground without a fight.

27:48.421 --> 27:50.021
Think of it as facing me.

27:51.791 --> 27:53.759
Once it has full
control of this facility,

27:53.760 --> 27:55.727
it will be unstoppable.

27:55.728 --> 27:57.929
It could easily spread
to the city and beyond.

27:57.930 --> 27:59.097
So how do we fight it?

27:59.098 --> 28:00.132
Henry, we need...

28:00.133 --> 28:01.666
the defense protocols. You got it, doc.

28:01.667 --> 28:03.135
I just need to be able to
feed it into the network.

28:03.136 --> 28:04.402
Which won't be easy.

28:04.403 --> 28:06.037
Fill me in.

28:06.038 --> 28:08.440
Energy creatures often
behave like viruses.

28:08.441 --> 28:09.875
They forge a parasitic relationship

28:09.876 --> 28:12.077
with whatever host
environment they can invade.

28:12.078 --> 28:13.111
Yeah, about four years ago

28:13.112 --> 28:14.479
we had something like this

28:14.480 --> 28:15.747
caught in our back-up generators.

28:15.748 --> 28:17.082
It caused a lot of craziness
till we flushed it out.

28:17.083 --> 28:18.583
How'd you do that?

28:18.584 --> 28:21.453
Well, this one's got
me locked out, but...

28:21.454 --> 28:23.421
You know, if we can
restart the main power,

28:23.422 --> 28:24.422
do a cold start,

28:24.423 --> 28:25.690
I might be able to gain control.

28:25.691 --> 28:26.825
Which means getting into the catacombs

28:26.826 --> 28:27.926
and shutting down the power.

28:27.927 --> 28:29.661
Which we can't do, can we?

28:29.662 --> 28:31.062
Well, we have to find a way.

28:31.063 --> 28:32.798
Kate, can you get out

28:32.799 --> 28:33.965
through the top of your elevator,

28:33.966 --> 28:35.801
climb to a different floor?

28:35.802 --> 28:37.536
I've already thought of that,

28:37.537 --> 28:38.837
but opinions are divided.

28:38.838 --> 28:40.305
I don't like it,

28:40.306 --> 28:42.774
not with something
monitoring our every move.

28:42.775 --> 28:44.709
Yeah, it's watching all of us,

28:44.710 --> 28:46.645
which is kind of creepy.

28:46.646 --> 28:48.613
Oh, come on, it can't
know what we're up to.

28:48.614 --> 28:50.081
All of you,

28:50.082 --> 28:51.783
knock out your security cameras

28:51.784 --> 28:53.952
as politely as possible.

29:11.437 --> 29:13.705
All right, done.

29:13.706 --> 29:16.541
Henry, are you able to
log onto the network?

29:16.542 --> 29:17.676
Yeah, but I'm totally locked out.

29:17.677 --> 29:19.978
It's like playing Xbox
without my... joystick.

29:19.979 --> 29:21.446
All right, keep trying to hack in.

29:21.447 --> 29:22.614
As the creature adjusts
to its new environment,

29:22.615 --> 29:24.182
it may give you an opening.

29:24.183 --> 29:26.117
All right, I'm on it.

29:26.118 --> 29:27.919
Will, do you have any
access to the old duct system

29:27.920 --> 29:29.054
from where you are?

29:29.055 --> 29:31.656
Uh... yeah, I guess there must be.

29:31.657 --> 29:32.958
Why, what are you thinking?

29:32.959 --> 29:33.992
The old heating system's obsolete.

29:33.993 --> 29:35.694
We switched to radiant years ago.

29:35.695 --> 29:38.463
Meaning it's probably outside
of electro's field of vision.

29:38.464 --> 29:39.731
Nice.

29:39.732 --> 29:41.233
Get down there, reboot the system.

29:41.234 --> 29:42.634
It should give us control
of some of the key sections.

29:42.635 --> 29:43.468
All right.

29:43.469 --> 29:45.070
Kate...

29:45.071 --> 29:46.571
One of you should climb
up to the next floor,

29:46.572 --> 29:50.075
see if there's another
way to the catacombs.

29:50.076 --> 29:51.676
We're on it.

29:54.881 --> 29:57.983
Are you sure?

29:57.984 --> 29:59.050
I can go.

29:59.051 --> 30:02.654
No. I'm lighter.

30:02.655 --> 30:04.122
I'll get there faster.

30:04.123 --> 30:05.156
Faster's good.

30:13.766 --> 30:16.701
Here, I'll help you.

30:16.702 --> 30:19.871
Hey, watch where the hands go, wookiee.

30:28.648 --> 30:30.148
Hey, I think I found a way in.

30:30.149 --> 30:31.216
All right, you should
go. Just be careful.

30:38.791 --> 30:40.592
See you in a few.

30:57.910 --> 31:00.679
You said you feel... different.

31:00.680 --> 31:02.814
What do you mean by that?

31:02.815 --> 31:05.917
The darkness within me

31:05.918 --> 31:08.586
is gone...

31:08.587 --> 31:10.822
completely.

31:10.823 --> 31:12.023
Far more than when Tesla shocked me.

31:12.024 --> 31:15.593
That was appeasement, but this...

31:15.594 --> 31:18.730
this is...

31:18.731 --> 31:20.031
so peaceful.

31:23.636 --> 31:26.304
It must have happened when
I restarted your heart.

31:26.305 --> 31:28.673
The creature jumped from
you into the facility itself.

31:28.674 --> 31:29.874
But how did it end up inside me

31:29.875 --> 31:30.909
in the first place?

31:30.910 --> 31:32.010
I have no recollection

31:32.011 --> 31:33.078
of ever encountering it before.

31:33.079 --> 31:34.145
You wouldn't have to.

31:34.146 --> 31:37.682
God, it actually makes sense.

31:37.683 --> 31:39.117
Every time you teleport,

31:39.118 --> 31:39.951
you convert your molecular structure

31:39.952 --> 31:40.986
to pure energy.

31:40.987 --> 31:42.454
Yes.

31:42.455 --> 31:43.621
The creature could have latched onto you

31:43.622 --> 31:45.190
during one of your jumps,

31:45.191 --> 31:47.625
integrated into your being
when you re-materialized.

31:47.626 --> 31:49.661
And now...

31:49.662 --> 31:51.696
That its influence is gone...

31:51.697 --> 31:55.033
Is it not possible this
entity was the sole cause

31:55.034 --> 31:57.002
of my bloodlust?

31:57.003 --> 31:58.837
That it's been polluting my soul

31:58.838 --> 32:00.705
since i began using my power?

32:02.608 --> 32:04.642
Oh...

32:04.643 --> 32:08.079
I want to believe you, John,

32:08.080 --> 32:10.715
but it's far too easy to
blame everything you've done

32:10.716 --> 32:11.683
on something else.

32:11.684 --> 32:15.253
Yeah.

32:15.254 --> 32:16.821
Right.

32:19.892 --> 32:20.825
My mind is so...

32:22.828 --> 32:24.863
Clear.

32:27.733 --> 32:29.267
As it was when we first met.

32:34.774 --> 32:39.244
That thing was my rage.

32:42.281 --> 32:44.149
I'm sure of it.

32:55.261 --> 32:57.862
Shh, shh, it's okay.

32:57.863 --> 32:59.197
You're okay here. You're okay.

33:04.203 --> 33:05.970
Oh, I so don't understand
what you're saying right now,

33:05.971 --> 33:08.239
but I can tell it's not good!

33:08.240 --> 33:09.841
Something's bugging you...

33:09.842 --> 33:11.309
you're an empath, and that's...

33:11.310 --> 33:13.411
Oh, God. Hang on a sec,
what the hell is that?

33:13.412 --> 33:16.114
Hang on.

33:16.115 --> 33:18.416
Doc?

33:18.417 --> 33:20.085
It's looking for something!

33:20.086 --> 33:22.187
It's scanning our chemical directory.

33:22.188 --> 33:25.423
How could it actually
access those compounds?

33:25.424 --> 33:26.958
Using the robotic assist mechanism.

33:26.959 --> 33:28.126
It is possible.

33:28.127 --> 33:30.095
What else could it be after?

33:30.096 --> 33:31.396
Well, it could just be doing

33:31.397 --> 33:32.897
an inventory diagnostic.

33:32.898 --> 33:34.232
I don't know, I'm still scanning.

33:34.233 --> 33:35.800
I'm trying to find a way to break in.

33:35.801 --> 33:37.268
If it shifts focus for...

33:37.269 --> 33:38.670
Henry?

33:38.671 --> 33:40.338
Doc?

33:48.347 --> 33:50.281
We lost the intercom!

33:52.017 --> 33:53.118
So fix it!

33:57.690 --> 33:59.057
John, what's its agenda?

33:59.058 --> 34:02.026
Chaos, death, suffering.

34:02.027 --> 34:03.328
Sound familiar?

34:03.329 --> 34:04.963
Once it learns everything it can

34:04.964 --> 34:06.231
about its environment,

34:06.232 --> 34:10.168
the violence will escalate.

34:12.338 --> 34:13.705
: Come out to the coast,

34:13.706 --> 34:17.242
we'll get together, have a few laughs...

34:21.280 --> 34:23.214
Right is east...

34:23.215 --> 34:25.717
Right?

34:28.219 --> 34:29.286
Okay...

34:37.463 --> 34:38.929
All right, fine.

34:38.931 --> 34:41.266
You want to play, let's play.

34:50.809 --> 34:53.411
Here we go.

34:53.411 --> 34:55.813
You zap me again,

34:55.813 --> 34:57.448
and I'll kill you...

34:57.449 --> 34:58.516
Somehow.

35:00.753 --> 35:02.220
Hallelujah!

35:06.425 --> 35:07.458
Oh, man...

35:07.459 --> 35:10.261
Oh, found the furnace.

35:17.836 --> 35:21.339
Thought these were out of commission.

35:26.478 --> 35:29.547
Defunct, my ass.

35:51.804 --> 35:52.971
Oh, crap.

36:05.351 --> 36:06.551
Oh, come on.

36:06.552 --> 36:08.319
Elevator, too?

36:08.320 --> 36:10.154
A little slack, please!

36:14.159 --> 36:15.560
Oh, not good.

36:15.561 --> 36:17.128
Kate!

36:17.129 --> 36:19.097
Dammit.

36:19.098 --> 36:20.365
Get down here!

36:20.366 --> 36:21.499
Get out of the way!

36:27.072 --> 36:28.406
We've got power again.

36:28.407 --> 36:31.409
Yes, but no control.

36:31.410 --> 36:33.411
It's always something, isn't it?

36:45.190 --> 36:46.591
Aah...

36:46.592 --> 36:48.393
I'm writing a damn symphony here.

36:49.428 --> 36:50.395
Come on...

36:50.396 --> 36:52.563
Just a tiny little command,

36:52.564 --> 36:55.033
nothing to threaten you.

36:55.034 --> 36:56.134
Come on...

36:56.135 --> 36:58.236
Come on!

37:19.158 --> 37:20.491
Yes!

37:20.492 --> 37:21.959
Suck it, electro! This is my town!

37:31.470 --> 37:33.338
This thing has brakes, right?

37:33.339 --> 37:34.505
Used to!

37:37.309 --> 37:39.077
Next, elevators.

37:39.078 --> 37:43.214
Right, emergency brakes are...

37:43.215 --> 37:45.283
Active! Okay!

37:45.284 --> 37:46.351
See? See? What'd I say?

37:55.127 --> 37:57.028
Okay, what else you got for me, Buddy?

38:00.966 --> 38:02.400
Oh, no.

38:18.484 --> 38:20.685
It's going to kill us all.

38:23.021 --> 38:26.123
Did I mention I hate rides?

38:33.064 --> 38:34.164
Uh, really?

38:46.044 --> 38:48.746
It's stripping the emergency brakes.

38:48.747 --> 38:50.481
And taking us higher,

38:50.482 --> 38:51.882
so that when we reach the top...

38:53.485 --> 38:55.085
We drop.

39:06.932 --> 39:08.832
Oh, you son of a...

39:08.833 --> 39:10.901
Ah...

39:10.902 --> 39:13.337
Come on, will, cut the power.

39:33.858 --> 39:34.892
Huh?

39:34.893 --> 39:35.993
Yebo.

39:35.994 --> 39:37.027
Yebo.

39:37.028 --> 39:38.362
Yebo, damn right!

40:03.488 --> 40:04.922
I believe your people

40:04.923 --> 40:05.956
have risen to the occasion.

40:05.957 --> 40:06.991
Of course they have.

40:06.992 --> 40:08.092
Hey, doc, it's Henry.

40:08.093 --> 40:09.193
Will did it.

40:09.194 --> 40:10.194
Communications are back,

40:10.195 --> 40:11.228
so's most of everything else.

40:11.229 --> 40:12.262
Most?

40:12.263 --> 40:13.731
Yeah, I'm working on it.

40:13.732 --> 40:15.833
Doc, the toxins it was scanning?

40:15.834 --> 40:18.302
It's making something
very bad, very fast.

40:18.303 --> 40:19.837
It's using the automated assist.

40:19.838 --> 40:21.138
Can you override it?

40:21.139 --> 40:22.272
Yeah, that's the problem.

40:22.273 --> 40:23.674
I've reclaimed everything else,

40:23.675 --> 40:25.242
but I'm still locked
out of the main lab.

40:25.243 --> 40:27.478
I can't make it stop.

40:27.479 --> 40:29.179
Mr. Foss, can you open the door?

40:29.180 --> 40:30.848
Uh, doc?

40:30.849 --> 40:32.282
It's all right, Henry.

40:32.283 --> 40:33.917
All right, hang on.

40:47.532 --> 40:49.466
Uh, ouch.

40:49.467 --> 40:51.402
Nice.

40:59.310 --> 41:02.046
Sarin gas nerve agent.

41:02.047 --> 41:03.213
We've got about 90 seconds.

41:03.214 --> 41:04.314
It'll release the
compound into the vents.

41:04.315 --> 41:05.382
It won't end here.

41:05.383 --> 41:07.084
It will grow,

41:07.085 --> 41:08.519
consuming whatever it can

41:08.520 --> 41:10.354
and never stop killing.

41:10.355 --> 41:11.388
Henry, we need more time.

41:11.389 --> 41:12.456
We don't have it.

41:16.361 --> 41:17.561
Okay, power's been reset.

41:17.562 --> 41:20.030
We should be good.

41:20.031 --> 41:22.166
What's happening now?

41:22.167 --> 41:23.901
My entire body

41:23.902 --> 41:24.902
is geared to being its home.

41:24.903 --> 41:26.236
Let me go.

41:26.237 --> 41:27.538
John, you don't have to do
this. We could find a way...

41:27.539 --> 41:29.073
I love you.

41:30.909 --> 41:33.477
Remember that...

41:33.478 --> 41:34.878
Always.

41:36.347 --> 41:38.048
Mr. Foss,

41:38.049 --> 41:39.616
would you be so kind

41:39.617 --> 41:41.452
as to deactivate

41:41.453 --> 41:43.020
the EM shield?

41:53.031 --> 41:54.398
For all eternity.

42:16.387 --> 42:18.489
Oh...

42:29.567 --> 42:31.835
I need a med kit right away!

42:34.339 --> 42:36.106
Get away from me!

42:36.107 --> 42:38.208
Please, let me help you!

42:38.209 --> 42:41.845
I don't need your help!

42:44.149 --> 42:46.884
It would have killed a lot
more if it weren't for you.

42:46.885 --> 42:49.553
You kept it at bay.

42:49.554 --> 42:50.988
I need to leave now.

42:50.989 --> 42:52.156
Where are you going?

42:55.927 --> 42:58.829
I have no destination in mind.

43:01.065 --> 43:01.899
John, wait.
