WEBVTT

00:05.214 --> 00:06.756
I can't do this button.

00:07.341 --> 00:08.508
You almost got it.

00:08.634 --> 00:09.967
Almost got it.

00:15.432 --> 00:16.599
The sound

00:19.061 --> 00:20.687
of the people talking...

00:20.813 --> 00:21.688
Mmm?

00:25.776 --> 00:27.652
- It's A-flat.
- Is it?

00:27.778 --> 00:30.071
Well, look how smart
you are, huh?

00:31.740 --> 00:34.325
Here we go.

00:49.591 --> 00:51.926
Thank you.
I am proud to introduce

00:52.052 --> 00:54.971
my son to you,
Patrick Obyedkov.

00:55.097 --> 00:58.349
Twenty-five years ago,
Patrick was in the fourth grade,

00:58.475 --> 01:02.437
a good student,
played Little League

01:02.563 --> 01:05.398
and then there
was the accident.

01:05.941 --> 01:07.525
And here we are,

01:07.776 --> 01:11.696
raising money for people
with similar neurological disabilities.

01:12.156 --> 01:14.490
I hope you enjoy the concert.

01:23.709 --> 01:25.168
You all set?

01:25.294 --> 01:26.836
All set.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.043
He's never missed a note.

02:11.173 --> 02:12.924
Something's wrong.

02:22.059 --> 02:23.643
Patrick, what is it?

02:23.769 --> 02:26.437
My hand, it hurts.

02:26.563 --> 02:28.898
Let me see it.

02:30.067 --> 02:31.984
Oh, Papa.

03:17.531 --> 03:18.656
What's the emergency?

03:18.782 --> 03:20.241
Thirty-five-year-old savant.

03:20.367 --> 03:21.784
Dystonia in his left hand.

03:21.910 --> 03:23.536
He paged us at 5:00 in
the morning for that?

03:24.580 --> 03:26.539
I'm going back to bed.
Dystonia's not life threatening.

03:26.665 --> 03:27.707
Clonazepam will
take care of it.

03:27.833 --> 03:31.002
He's already on clonazepam
for seizures he has

03:31.128 --> 03:32.628
from a bus accident
when he was 10.

03:32.754 --> 03:34.839
Then we treat
with benztropine.

03:34.965 --> 03:35.965
What's up?

03:36.091 --> 03:37.758
Thirty-five-year-old savant.
Dystonia.

03:38.844 --> 03:40.761
I'm going back to bed.

03:41.263 --> 03:42.471
Where you going?

03:42.890 --> 03:44.849
Bathroom. It can wait.

03:44.975 --> 03:46.684
There is no case, House.

03:46.810 --> 03:49.770
Even if dystonia was some
big medical mystery, it's not this time.

03:49.897 --> 03:52.565
You're not intrigued as to how a
perfectly healthy 10-year-old boy

03:52.691 --> 03:54.609
with no prior
musical training gets into an accident

03:54.735 --> 03:57.028
on his way to school
and can suddenly play the piano?

03:57.154 --> 04:00.656
Do we have to solve
a 25-year-old case before breakfast?

04:00.782 --> 04:01.616
You two shower together?

04:01.742 --> 04:02.700
- No.
- No.

04:02.826 --> 04:03.993
Double negative.
That's a yes.

04:04.411 --> 04:07.246
Savantism is just
one of those things. It's inexplicable.

04:07.372 --> 04:10.499
Just because it's inexplicted
doesn't mean it's inexplicable.

04:10.626 --> 04:13.294
I want new labs,
CBC with platelets, chem panel,

04:13.420 --> 04:15.379
thyroid and
adrenal function tests.

04:15.505 --> 04:16.380
For what?

04:16.506 --> 04:17.548
I don't know.

04:21.219 --> 04:23.137
Raise your left hand.

04:23.972 --> 04:25.514
That's your right hand.

04:28.018 --> 04:29.101
What are you looking for?

04:29.227 --> 04:32.438
Just want to make sure
whatever happened doesn't happen again.

04:32.564 --> 04:33.981
- Push up.
- Push up.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.943
He repeats what people say.
It's a compensation mechanism.

04:37.069 --> 04:38.569
He knows he's supposed
to say something

04:38.779 --> 04:40.571
so he repeats
what he's just heard.

04:40.697 --> 04:42.531
Well, that's good.
Shows he's engaged.

04:43.492 --> 04:45.242
Spine's okay.

04:45.369 --> 04:48.913
All right, stick out your tongue
like this. Copy me.

04:49.039 --> 04:50.623
You have a big tongue.

04:50.749 --> 04:54.001
Hey, I know it's
funny but copy me.

05:01.218 --> 05:03.260
There was
construction on Radcliffe.

05:03.387 --> 05:05.388
So I had to get
out of the car

05:05.514 --> 05:07.682
and walk in high
heels for over a mile.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.601
Radcliffe?
What was the cross street?

05:10.727 --> 05:11.769
Does it matter?

05:11.895 --> 05:14.438
I don't know.
I'm not the one who brought it up.

05:14.564 --> 05:17.733
Tie this off. Nice and tight.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.699
Does this have anything
to do with my foot?

05:24.825 --> 05:26.325
You have a blister.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.703
You don't waste
a doctor's time with a blister.

05:28.829 --> 05:31.747
You waste a doctor's time
with more important things,

05:31.873 --> 05:34.291
like the sewer
that's being vented out of your mouth.

05:34.418 --> 05:35.918
My breath?

05:36.044 --> 05:37.962
If you could stop doing that,
we'd all be grateful.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.296
I can't stop breathing.

05:39.423 --> 05:40.798
Nope.
But you can stop puking.

05:40.924 --> 05:43.467
- I don't.
- Your lips say, "No."

05:43.593 --> 05:46.012
Your gnarly fingers say...

05:49.474 --> 05:51.225
He's good to go.

05:51.476 --> 05:54.645
It's a shame.
You look cute that thin.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.442
Motor cortex looks good.
Everything checks out.

05:59.568 --> 06:00.443
What tests did you run?

06:00.569 --> 06:01.569
Full battery of
neurological...

06:01.695 --> 06:05.406
I need this blood checked for
cholesterol and glucose levels.

06:05.991 --> 06:07.366
Patient had a foot problem.

06:07.492 --> 06:08.534
Different patient.

06:08.660 --> 06:10.453
There was no
one else in there.

06:10.579 --> 06:12.580
You're using
the wrong equipment.

06:24.468 --> 06:26.635
Dr. Foreman,
I thought we were being discharged.

06:26.762 --> 06:27.887
I'm Dr. House,

06:28.764 --> 06:31.223
and on the off chance
that Dr. Foreman didn't mention it,

06:31.433 --> 06:33.684
I have something
of a gift, too.

06:33.810 --> 06:35.269
Come on.

06:51.369 --> 06:52.578
- Your turn.
- My turn.

07:06.468 --> 07:08.886
Does this have anything to do
with his hand?

07:09.137 --> 07:10.346
It might.

07:10.472 --> 07:12.515
Okay, Patrick.
Close your eyes.

07:13.391 --> 07:14.600
What's this?

07:16.019 --> 07:19.021
- D, G-flat, A-flat, B.
- Yeah. All right, all right.

07:19.147 --> 07:21.482
He's good. Can we let him go?

07:21.608 --> 07:24.068
He's great. He's staying.

08:33.180 --> 08:34.680
Call radiology.

08:34.806 --> 08:37.016
We need
a functional MRI on his brain.

08:37.142 --> 08:39.268
FMRI's not gonna show trauma.

08:39.394 --> 08:41.437
We're not looking for trauma.

08:41.563 --> 08:43.439
I want to see the music.

08:44.399 --> 08:45.941
See the music.

08:51.489 --> 08:52.740
Well, that's dull.

08:52.866 --> 08:55.242
You think the FMRI's
gonna show a big arrow

08:55.368 --> 08:58.287
pointing to a flashing sign
saying "savantism"?

08:58.413 --> 08:59.705
It would be hugely helpful.

08:59.831 --> 09:02.750
Somehow he got rewired
as a music specialist.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.877
I want to know
how that happens.

09:05.003 --> 09:07.755
He has access to parts of
the brain that you don't.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.506
His brain's doing nothing.

09:09.633 --> 09:11.383
He looks like
any jerk listening.

09:11.509 --> 09:15.179
He's not a savant at listening,
he's a savant at playing.

09:15.764 --> 09:19.975
Well, listening and playing are
two different neurological processes.

09:23.146 --> 09:24.980
Turn off the music.

09:26.024 --> 09:30.069
Patrick, I want you to pretend
that your leg's a piano.

09:30.195 --> 09:31.570
My leg's not a piano.

09:32.530 --> 09:34.490
I know.
That's why I said "pretend."

09:35.533 --> 09:36.700
Kid's a moron.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.703
Keep your head still.
Use your fingers.

10:01.851 --> 10:02.935
Wow.

10:03.061 --> 10:04.186
Cool, huh?

10:05.355 --> 10:06.397
His heart rate rose.

10:06.523 --> 10:07.690
Emotional response?

10:07.816 --> 10:10.150
Then why's there no activity
in the limbic system?

10:10.277 --> 10:12.027
Unless there's
a problem with his heart.

10:12.153 --> 10:13.862
Do an echo to confirm.

10:13.989 --> 10:16.615
And scrub up.
He's gonna need surgery.

10:19.035 --> 10:20.411
It wasn't dystonia.

10:20.912 --> 10:22.746
He's got a heart
condition that caused

10:22.872 --> 10:24.581
the arteries in
his arm to constrict.

10:24.708 --> 10:27.918
Do you have any idea
why House would want to go to Boston?

10:28.044 --> 10:29.211
The chowder?

10:29.337 --> 10:31.588
Plane tickets this Friday.

10:31.715 --> 10:32.756
I opened his mail.

10:32.882 --> 10:35.467
I heard there's an opening at
Harvard for Division Chief,

10:35.593 --> 10:37.886
Infectious Disease.

10:38.013 --> 10:41.390
Ambition is not one of his
more prominent traits.

10:41.516 --> 10:42.433
Although...

10:42.559 --> 10:44.059
What?

10:44.185 --> 10:46.437
He was testing
blood in the clinic.

10:46.563 --> 10:48.689
I don't think it
was a patient's blood.

10:49.024 --> 10:50.274
Why? It was green?

10:50.400 --> 10:52.109
No, he was checking
for routine stuff.

10:52.652 --> 10:57.156
Makes sense if he's looking for
basic medical clearance for employment.

11:03.288 --> 11:04.496
I'm going home.

11:05.707 --> 11:06.623
No, you're not.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.500
He could show up any minute.

11:10.712 --> 11:13.422
Not with a savant
to obsess about.

11:18.261 --> 11:21.221
I'll take in here.
Bedroom's down the hall.

11:21.348 --> 11:22.765
You've been here?

11:23.725 --> 11:25.726
Where else would
the bedroom be?

11:26.644 --> 11:28.687
Come with?

11:29.731 --> 11:31.523
You're scared of
him catching us breaking into his home

11:31.649 --> 11:34.985
but you're not scared of him catching us
doing it in his bed?

11:36.780 --> 11:39.031
If I'm gonna get
fired anyway...

11:40.367 --> 11:46.288
Almost at the heart.
Ablating and done.

11:47.749 --> 11:49.792
Heart rate's 160.
It's accelerating.

11:49.918 --> 11:51.251
He's at 210!

11:51.378 --> 11:52.711
He's in
supraventricular tachycardia.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.380
Paddles!

11:54.506 --> 11:55.631
Charging.

11:56.508 --> 11:57.633
Clear!

11:58.760 --> 12:00.677
We're wasting our time.

12:01.930 --> 12:03.180
His high-school yearbook.

12:03.306 --> 12:04.348
Unless you think
he's going to Boston

12:04.474 --> 12:05.682
to attend
a high-school reunion,

12:05.809 --> 12:07.559
put it back and let's get out of here
before he comes home.

12:07.685 --> 12:09.144
He's not smiling.

12:09.270 --> 12:11.021
I wonder if he has teeth.

12:11.147 --> 12:12.523
What's the area
code for Boston?

12:12.649 --> 12:14.108
617, why?

12:19.406 --> 12:22.366
Massachusetts General. May I help you?

12:23.410 --> 12:26.370
Did you think you could steal
Dr. House without a fight?

12:26.496 --> 12:27.329
Steal him for what?

12:27.455 --> 12:29.540
Quit jerking me around.
I know he's coming out there.

12:29.666 --> 12:30.874
We're not
looking to hire him.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.626
He's called you six times
in the last month.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.128
We're not
looking to hire him.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.380
You think if you keep repeating it,
I'll start believing you?

12:36.506 --> 12:38.173
Dr. Cuddy, there's
nothing else I can say.

12:38.299 --> 12:39.883
I'm sorry.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.762
If he's not coming there
for a job interview,

12:43.888 --> 12:45.180
he's either coming
to your hospital

12:45.306 --> 12:47.766
for a social visit or
because he's a patient.

12:52.063 --> 12:54.440
Is it a social visit,
Dr. Medak?

12:54.858 --> 12:56.483
I can't stand House.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.444
Neither can Dr. Coopersmith.

13:07.370 --> 13:08.579
What's up?

13:10.832 --> 13:13.250
Do you know a
Dr. Coopersmith in Boston?

13:13.710 --> 13:15.794
Yeah. He's an oncologist.

13:16.754 --> 13:17.921
What's up?

13:18.047 --> 13:21.175
- What's his subspecialty?
- Brain cancer.

13:23.261 --> 13:24.761
What's going on?

13:29.851 --> 13:31.477
He doesn't look sick.

13:31.603 --> 13:32.895
He should have symptoms.

13:33.021 --> 13:37.608
Blurred vision, headaches,
confusion, clumsiness.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.568
Depends how far
along the cancer is.

13:39.694 --> 13:41.445
What kind, how aggressive.

13:41.571 --> 13:43.280
He didn't tell you?

13:44.616 --> 13:46.283
House is House.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.619
He's no different
than anyone else with cancer.

13:48.745 --> 13:52.331
Once you tell,
then every conversation is about that.

13:54.459 --> 13:56.126
Cardiac arrest
means we were wrong.

13:56.252 --> 13:57.586
There was a heart problem.

13:57.712 --> 13:59.213
But no vasoconstriction.

13:59.339 --> 14:02.174
The heart problem
couldn't have caused the hand problem.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.635
Unless the bleed
happened suddenly.

14:05.094 --> 14:07.179
Less blood to the brain
explains the dystonia.

14:07.305 --> 14:09.139
Less blood to the heart
explains the heart attack.

14:09.265 --> 14:10.641
Scope him above and below.

14:10.767 --> 14:12.601
If that doesn't work,
gut him.

14:15.271 --> 14:17.272
Can't you sedate him?

14:17.398 --> 14:19.233
There's a risk his
throat could collapse.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.901
You look mad, Papa.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.402
No.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.780
No, I'm not mad.
I promise you.

14:24.906 --> 14:28.325
It's just that the doctor
has to do something to you and it's...

14:28.451 --> 14:29.868
And it's gonna hurt.

14:29.994 --> 14:31.370
Hurt me? Why hurt me?

14:32.038 --> 14:33.247
Make you better.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.165
What's wrong with me?

14:35.416 --> 14:37.501
Well, they don't know.

14:39.504 --> 14:41.421
Patrick, don't you worry.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.215
Everything is gonna be great.

14:43.341 --> 14:44.466
All right.
Here we go, Patrick.

14:44.592 --> 14:45.842
You wanna hurt me.

14:45.969 --> 14:48.053
Hey, open. Like this.

14:51.391 --> 14:55.352
You just look at me
and everything is gonna be okay.

14:56.020 --> 14:57.396
Look at me now.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.481
Patrick.

14:59.607 --> 15:02.818
There you are.
It's okay. It's okay, really.

15:04.529 --> 15:07.447
Dr. Wilson. Wilson!

15:08.491 --> 15:09.491
I just spoke to Cuddy.

15:09.617 --> 15:10.784
She can't confirm
whether House

15:10.910 --> 15:12.244
is applying for
a job in Boston.

15:12.370 --> 15:13.996
Yeah. I'm late for a...

15:14.122 --> 15:17.541
If I have to look for work,
I have a right to know.

15:32.849 --> 15:34.141
Pretty.

15:35.893 --> 15:38.895
I wrote this when I was
in junior high school.

15:39.647 --> 15:42.441
Could never figure
out what came next.

15:43.067 --> 15:45.569
Then dimwit
came up with this.

15:51.534 --> 15:53.285
It's good.

15:53.411 --> 15:55.203
It's perfect.

15:58.124 --> 16:01.084
I could set up a tower on the roof
during a lightning storm.

16:01.210 --> 16:03.837
Help you switch
brains with your patient.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.673
Then you would be
the brilliant pianist

16:06.799 --> 16:10.344
and he would be the doctor
hiding brain cancer from his friend.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.555
It's nothing.

16:14.432 --> 16:17.059
You need to talk about it.

16:17.185 --> 16:18.685
At least let me look
at your medical file.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.188
You're making a big
deal out of nothing.

16:21.314 --> 16:24.149
- Who else knows?
- No one, and cancer isn't nothing.

16:24.275 --> 16:26.443
Sorry. Didn't mean to
offend your specialty.

16:26.569 --> 16:27.694
Why didn't you come to me?

16:27.820 --> 16:28.779
Stein's good.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.156
Stein's in Africa for
the next six months.

16:31.282 --> 16:32.699
He's given me
at least six months.

16:32.825 --> 16:35.494
I go to Boston.
I get the treatment.

16:35.620 --> 16:37.287
Everything will be fine.

16:37.413 --> 16:39.039
No need to talk about it.

16:39.749 --> 16:40.791
You were right.

16:40.917 --> 16:42.501
Surgeon found
a bleed behind the kidney

16:42.627 --> 16:46.213
in the retroperitoneal cavity,
but no reason for it.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.674
No cancer,
no ruptured arteries.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.967
So bleeding explains
the symptoms

16:51.094 --> 16:53.261
but we've got no explanation
for the bleeding.

16:53.888 --> 16:55.389
And while they
were closing him up,

16:55.515 --> 16:56.515
Patrick had
a grand mal seizure,

16:56.641 --> 16:58.141
which makes no sense,

16:58.267 --> 17:00.602
since he's on
an anticonvulsant medication.

17:02.438 --> 17:03.730
You told him.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.023
No, I didn't.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.364
I only told Cameron.

17:16.411 --> 17:17.786
Hey!

17:20.707 --> 17:24.835
Okay, you guys have cleverly deduced
that I have cancer.

17:24.961 --> 17:26.336
You have no right to know.

17:26.462 --> 17:27.337
You have no business knowing.

17:27.463 --> 17:29.005
We'd like to run
some blood tests.

17:29.132 --> 17:31.383
As soon as you
work up our patient, who is not me.

17:31.509 --> 17:33.468
We just want to make sure
you weren't misdiagnosed.

17:33.594 --> 17:35.387
I wasn't. Let's move on.

17:35.513 --> 17:37.264
We're just asking
for a couple of vials.

17:37.390 --> 17:38.765
- No!
- Why not?

17:38.891 --> 17:42.144
Okay, we are going to proceed
as if I am perfectly healthy.

17:42.270 --> 17:44.104
How can we do that
if we know you're not?

17:44.230 --> 17:46.273
You don't know anything!

17:46.399 --> 17:47.733
Except, hopefully,

17:47.859 --> 17:51.403
how a patient on
anticonvulsant medication has a seizure.

17:51.529 --> 17:53.155
Anti-seizure meds
don't prevent seizures.

17:53.281 --> 17:54.489
They just make
them manageable.

17:54.615 --> 17:55.907
According to
the surgeon's report,

17:56.033 --> 17:57.451
this one wasn't even
close to manageable.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.953
Means the question isn't,
"Why is he having seizures?"

18:00.079 --> 18:02.038
It's, "Why are his
seizures getting worse?"

18:02.582 --> 18:03.957
What's changed?

18:04.083 --> 18:06.126
His brain. It's gotten worse.

18:06.252 --> 18:08.462
So we make it even worser.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.630
We take him off
anticonvulsant medication.

18:10.757 --> 18:11.882
He'll seize even more.

18:12.008 --> 18:14.092
Multiple seizures can
seriously damage a brain.

18:14.218 --> 18:15.635
Dude can't button a shirt.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.387
How much more damage
are we really talking about?

18:17.513 --> 18:19.639
Stronger seizures will light up
different parts of the brain,

18:19.766 --> 18:21.475
which will indicate
which parts are damaged.

18:21.601 --> 18:24.186
Once he gets worse,
do a PET scan.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.488
PET scan done?

18:34.614 --> 18:35.989
No.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.200
Did you come for my feelings?

18:38.326 --> 18:40.160
'Cause I left them
in my other pants.

18:40.453 --> 18:41.620
This is a letter
of recommendation.

18:41.871 --> 18:43.830
I'm applying
for a job at Penn.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.420
Thank you for
writing your own.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.506
I'm sure my thoughts
are beautifully phrased.

18:52.632 --> 18:56.676
Thank you for signing it,
saves me having to fake your signature.

19:05.269 --> 19:07.229
Stay away from Weiss.

19:08.397 --> 19:12.234
He cries with his patients,
holds their hands as they die.

19:12.360 --> 19:13.902
He won't like you.

19:14.695 --> 19:18.031
Your newfound nonchalance
in the face of cancer.

19:21.744 --> 19:23.453
I thought you'd
find it appealing.

19:23.579 --> 19:26.164
20 seconds. Pretty good.

19:26.707 --> 19:27.541
For what?

19:27.667 --> 19:31.378
The time it took you to go
from hard-ass to human being.

19:35.258 --> 19:36.424
You really want to leave?

19:36.551 --> 19:39.302
If you're not here,
there's not much point in staying.

19:39.428 --> 19:41.304
I'm not dead yet.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.313
What are you doing?

19:57.405 --> 20:00.282
I know this must be
a turn-on for you.

20:34.108 --> 20:36.902
A little whorish
to kiss and stab.

20:37.403 --> 20:38.361
You kissed back.

20:38.487 --> 20:40.947
I didn't want you to die
without knowing the feeling.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.366
Actually, no woman should die
without knowing the feeling.

20:43.492 --> 20:45.660
All we need is a few
drops of your blood.

20:45.786 --> 20:47.954
Foreman and Chase's lips
are not gonna get so close,

20:48.080 --> 20:49.414
now that I know your plan.

20:49.540 --> 20:51.541
There's a nurse downstairs
about to risk his job

20:51.667 --> 20:53.335
to steal the blood
you drew from yourself yesterday.

20:53.461 --> 20:55.754
I'm patient number 020406,

20:55.880 --> 20:58.632
in the record room,
under the name Luke N. Laura.

20:58.758 --> 21:01.384
There's a whole vial of blood
in there along with CT scans,

21:01.510 --> 21:03.720
MRIs, CSF.
Everything you need.

21:06.724 --> 21:10.393
If you need a sperm sample,
come back without the needle.

21:19.195 --> 21:22.155
Six centimeter mass
in his dorsal midbrain,

21:22.281 --> 21:24.491
extending into
the temporal lobe.

21:25.368 --> 21:27.160
That's inoperable.

21:27.662 --> 21:29.704
What kind of
time does he have?

21:31.040 --> 21:32.666
He's got a year.

21:36.212 --> 21:38.505
Nurse! Nurse!

21:45.763 --> 21:48.431
Here's the consent from Boston
for the cancer drug trial.

21:48.557 --> 21:50.934
Any description
of the process or previous trials?

21:51.060 --> 21:52.894
- Yep.
- Any chance it'll work?

21:53.020 --> 21:55.230
No. It's not even
designed to work.

21:55.606 --> 21:56.439
Why would he...

21:56.565 --> 21:59.401
It's designed to treat depression
in terminal cancer patients.

21:59.527 --> 22:00.735
He doesn't seem depressed.

22:04.198 --> 22:06.908
Okay,
let's assume that I am dying,

22:07.034 --> 22:09.786
which I specifically
told you not to assume.

22:09.912 --> 22:12.956
Can we at least assume
that I'm not dying tomorrow?

22:13.082 --> 22:14.165
Whereas this kid...

22:14.291 --> 22:17.669
PET revealed several more hot spots
but they're non-specific.

22:17.795 --> 22:19.337
How can you focus on him?

22:19.463 --> 22:21.423
It's the only way I can cope.

22:21.632 --> 22:24.342
PET also showed a left brain
that's working hard.

22:24.468 --> 22:25.593
Harder than the right?

22:25.720 --> 22:27.178
Wouldn't be worth
mentioning otherwise.

22:27.304 --> 22:29.681
Bleeding in the brain,
blood would irritate the lining,

22:29.807 --> 22:31.808
might cause
the seizures to get worse.

22:31.934 --> 22:35.228
Yes, he needs an angiogram to look at
the vasculature inside his brain.

22:35.354 --> 22:38.106
We'll get right on it
as soon as we're finished here.

22:39.233 --> 22:42.569
Don't get up. I got it.
You're busy. Continue.

22:49.160 --> 22:52.162
You know what my team
is doing right now?

22:52.830 --> 22:53.913
No.

22:54.874 --> 22:57.292
They're trying to figure out
what's wrong with me.

22:57.418 --> 22:58.251
What's wrong with you?

22:58.377 --> 22:59.753
Thanks for asking.

23:00.588 --> 23:02.255
They've found out
that I'm dying.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.090
That's sad.

23:05.217 --> 23:06.593
Everyone's dying.

23:07.094 --> 23:07.969
That's sad.

23:08.095 --> 23:10.597
If a meteor lands
on my head tomorrow, it's all academic.

23:10.723 --> 23:13.641
I told them to leave me alone.
But did they?

23:13.768 --> 23:15.018
Did they?

23:15.144 --> 23:16.311
That one was rhetorical.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.021
Oh.

23:18.564 --> 23:20.315
No, they did not.

23:24.278 --> 23:26.613
Who the hell were you
before you hit your head?

23:26.739 --> 23:28.364
Hell is a bad word.

23:28.491 --> 23:30.075
So is "ass" and "bitch."

23:30.201 --> 23:32.327
I could probably
rattle off 50 much more

23:32.453 --> 23:34.204
complicated and
disgusting ones,

23:34.330 --> 23:36.539
but then your dad
would get pissed at me.

23:38.209 --> 23:40.210
You like your life?

23:40.628 --> 23:42.045
What life?

23:42.254 --> 23:43.254
Your life.

23:44.340 --> 23:48.051
Playing the piano, going on tour,
scoring girls left and right.

23:48.344 --> 23:50.011
I don't like girls.

23:50.137 --> 23:52.138
Boys. Whatever gets you off.

23:52.473 --> 23:54.015
I like the piano.

23:58.896 --> 24:00.230
What's wrong?

24:02.274 --> 24:05.735
Dr. Peter Hayes. This is Eric Foreman,
at Princeton-Plainsboro.

24:05.861 --> 24:08.321
You're doing a signal transduction
inhibitor clinical trial.

24:08.656 --> 24:10.281
What kind of
results have you been...

24:10.407 --> 24:13.076
Transduction inhibitors
are a decade away.

24:15.204 --> 24:16.329
Bye, Pete.

24:20.501 --> 24:22.335
They've got another
trial going at Duke.

24:22.461 --> 24:25.588
15 percent extend their lives
beyond five years.

24:25.714 --> 24:29.217
- If you're positive for protein PHF...
- Stop trying to save me.

24:29.635 --> 24:31.594
I'm fine.

24:31.720 --> 24:34.305
MRA confirmed small
collections of blood

24:34.431 --> 24:36.850
throughout the white matter
of Patrick's right hemisphere.

24:36.976 --> 24:38.434
Mind if we chat about that
for a few moments?

24:38.561 --> 24:42.188
Either trauma, an aneurysm,
cancer or autoimmune disease.

24:42.314 --> 24:44.107
We need a biopsy to
figure out which it is.

24:44.233 --> 24:45.692
His EEG was non-specific.

24:45.818 --> 24:46.776
Where you going to biopsy?

24:46.902 --> 24:47.777
Everywhere.

24:47.903 --> 24:51.072
Sure, just put on a blindfold
and play "Pin the Tail on the Brain."

24:51.198 --> 24:53.825
He's bleeding into his brain.
He's dying.

24:53.951 --> 24:56.411
You can't just randomly
stab the temporal lobe

24:56.537 --> 24:57.996
and hope you hit
the right spot.

24:58.122 --> 24:59.455
I'm only gonna take
little tiny pieces.

24:59.999 --> 25:00.832
Till what?

25:00.958 --> 25:02.041
Till I find the problem.

25:02.168 --> 25:03.168
Or you kill him.

25:03.294 --> 25:05.628
No, I'll keep going,
even if I kill him.

25:09.341 --> 25:12.552
Then he's screwed.
Thanks for the chat.

25:22.730 --> 25:26.649
What if we do the EEG
from inside his brain?

25:27.359 --> 25:29.485
I'm actually
a little insulted.

25:29.737 --> 25:31.821
You were supposed to
spend the last hour worrying about me.

25:32.239 --> 25:33.281
It's risky and invasive.

25:33.407 --> 25:35.366
But that's why God invented
the long consent form.

25:35.492 --> 25:37.452
Can you get to why
this is a brilliant idea?

25:37.578 --> 25:39.329
External EEG
could get confused

25:39.455 --> 25:41.581
if there are multiple
structural abnormalities.

25:41.707 --> 25:44.334
If we perform
the EEG inside the skull,

25:44.460 --> 25:47.128
it could show us
where to biopsy.

25:47.254 --> 25:49.380
Brilliant. Go. Do.

25:50.966 --> 25:52.383
I'd also like to
talk to you about...

25:52.509 --> 25:54.928
This is going to be personal,
isn't it?

25:55.054 --> 25:56.346
Yeah.

26:09.985 --> 26:13.196
We'll use a small drill
to get inside his skull.

26:14.531 --> 26:16.324
There's bleeding inside?

26:16.450 --> 26:19.494
Yes. Once we have 12 holes,

26:19.620 --> 26:21.454
we'll surgically
implant the electrodes

26:21.580 --> 26:23.915
under the meninges,
against the brain.

26:27.378 --> 26:31.506
And it's either cancer
or autoimmune disease?

26:31.799 --> 26:33.466
Sorry, but yeah.

26:35.219 --> 26:37.136
Which one is better?

26:39.223 --> 26:40.265
Neither.

27:12.172 --> 27:13.464
Hey.

27:13.590 --> 27:14.716
Where do we cut?

27:14.842 --> 27:15.883
We don't.

27:16.885 --> 27:19.053
I need to say something.

27:19.638 --> 27:20.930
Something personal?

27:21.307 --> 27:22.140
Yeah.

27:22.766 --> 27:23.850
And I can't leave

27:23.976 --> 27:25.810
because you've got
something interesting in that file.

27:26.312 --> 27:27.145
Sorry.

27:32.818 --> 27:37.530
You're an arrogant ass who makes it
impossible for anyone to like him

27:37.656 --> 27:39.324
by punishing people
who don't deserve...

27:39.450 --> 27:42.285
Can you get to the "but" part
of this speech?

27:42.745 --> 27:44.412
But I like you.

27:44.538 --> 27:45.663
No, you don't.

27:45.914 --> 27:48.333
You're just reacting to
the perception of my death

27:48.751 --> 27:50.918
and the need to put things in order.
Fear of guilt...

27:51.045 --> 27:52.253
Just shut up.

27:52.379 --> 27:54.213
See? I annoy you.

27:54.340 --> 27:57.842
Now, you gonna give me the results
or are you gonna...

28:00.554 --> 28:04.140
Intracranial EEG showed
no electrical abnormalities.

28:04.266 --> 28:06.142
- Which means it's autoimmune.
- No.

28:06.268 --> 28:09.354
It also showed his entire right
hemisphere is brain-dead.

28:15.194 --> 28:21.324
So while you guys were worrying about
me, half this kid's brain died.

28:21.450 --> 28:24.994
The only solace you should take from
this is the fact that it didn't.

28:25.120 --> 28:28.164
Garden variety EEG sucks
compared to the in-brain variety,

28:28.290 --> 28:29.374
but it's not going
to miss brain death.

28:29.500 --> 28:31.334
- He's gotten worse.
- Not that much worse.

28:31.460 --> 28:32.877
Respiration is depressed.

28:33.003 --> 28:34.837
Seizures are increasing,
one every five minutes.

28:34.963 --> 28:37.090
Not that much worse.

28:37.341 --> 28:39.133
He can still talk
and he's left-handed,

28:39.259 --> 28:40.676
which means speech
is in the right side.

28:40.803 --> 28:43.971
You don't know how Patrick's brain
reorganized itself 25 years ago.

28:44.098 --> 28:47.934
What if the right side
is just a little dead?

28:48.143 --> 28:50.770
Maybe he still has
random neurons firing.

28:50.979 --> 28:54.065
You're just looking for a puzzle to
distract you from your own situation.

28:54.191 --> 28:56.859
You're right, he's dead.
Let's go home.

28:59.947 --> 29:01.989
What did you find out?

29:02.741 --> 29:04.867
Is he gonna be okay?

29:04.993 --> 29:06.452
- I'm sorry.
- Yes!

29:11.166 --> 29:12.458
What's this?

29:12.584 --> 29:14.043
A piano.

29:14.795 --> 29:16.212
What's this?

29:21.051 --> 29:22.135
He's obviously lost use...

29:22.261 --> 29:23.428
Shut up.

29:43.073 --> 29:45.116
Music is a global process.

29:45.242 --> 29:47.577
You can't play
the piano with half a brain.

29:50.122 --> 29:51.456
What's it mean?

29:51.582 --> 29:54.041
Means the right side of
his brain has always sucked.

29:54.168 --> 29:56.586
Means it's not relevant
to what's going on now.

29:56.712 --> 29:58.754
- Wow. Then it's autoimmune.
- Yeah.

29:58.881 --> 30:00.506
Question is what
do we do about it?

30:00.632 --> 30:01.966
Most likely ones we can fix.

30:02.092 --> 30:05.344
Polyarteritis nodosa,
Takayasu or Sarcoid.

30:05.471 --> 30:07.054
I'll start treatment.

30:07.181 --> 30:08.681
Not what I was talking about.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.308
But, yeah, you do that.

30:17.858 --> 30:19.233
Your turn?

30:19.776 --> 30:21.319
Do you have to do that?

30:22.779 --> 30:25.114
You mean cheapen everyone's attempt
at a human moment

30:25.240 --> 30:28.326
by identifying the real calculations
that go into it?

30:28.535 --> 30:30.578
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I do.

30:31.413 --> 30:34.707
I'm sorry you're dying,
I'm gonna hug you.

30:35.209 --> 30:36.167
Anything to say?

30:36.502 --> 30:38.377
If you're considering
grabbing my ass,

30:38.504 --> 30:41.631
don't start anything
you can't finish.

30:45.135 --> 30:47.428
Well, as long as we're just standing
here, you mind if we work?

30:47.804 --> 30:49.764
How's the kid's
treatment going?

30:51.642 --> 30:52.808
Are you crying?

30:53.268 --> 30:54.435
No.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.314
Respiration rate's up.

30:58.440 --> 31:00.650
Seizures are calming down.
It's all good.

31:02.027 --> 31:04.612
Not for what
I'm gonna do next.

31:04.738 --> 31:07.031
There is no next.
He's gonna be fine.

31:07.282 --> 31:11.077
Only if he wants to remain
a four-year-old who wets his bed.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.287
There's nothing else for him.

31:13.413 --> 31:15.540
There's better.
Thanks for the hug.

31:37.020 --> 31:38.771
It's the middle of the night.

31:39.231 --> 31:40.856
You knew I'd be asleep.

31:41.066 --> 31:42.858
Phone would have woken you up
just as much.

31:42.985 --> 31:45.736
And I can't see
what you're wearing on the phone.

31:47.030 --> 31:51.450
My patient with the 55 IQ
has Takayasu syndrome.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.744
Very uncommon.

31:53.870 --> 31:55.788
Happens mostly
in Asian women.

31:55.914 --> 31:59.584
Takayasu is manageable with steroids,
which you already know.

31:59.710 --> 32:02.503
So I assume you're here
for something else.

32:02.629 --> 32:04.839
My patient also has
a significant seizure problem.

32:04.965 --> 32:07.383
Also manageable with
anticonvulsant medication.

32:07.509 --> 32:09.969
Yes, and if he kept taking his
anticonvulsant medication,

32:10.095 --> 32:12.847
he could go back on tour
and play the piano.

32:12.973 --> 32:15.808
But a hemispherectomy

32:16.893 --> 32:19.478
would completely stop
the right-brain seizure activity

32:19.605 --> 32:21.230
and he would no
longer need to take

32:21.356 --> 32:22.648
his anticonvulsant medication.

32:22.774 --> 32:24.025
You want to remove
half his brain?

32:24.234 --> 32:25.443
The right half.

32:25.569 --> 32:26.986
It would be irresponsible
to remove the left.

32:27.112 --> 32:29.822
You don't remove half a brain
and gain function!

32:29.948 --> 32:34.327
Not my brain.
But his? Who knows? What?

32:34.828 --> 32:36.954
Let's say that I'm the left side
of Patrick's brain.

32:37.080 --> 32:39.206
I'm quick-witted, I'm charming,
I'm great looking.

32:39.333 --> 32:40.416
You're the right
side of his brain.

32:40.542 --> 32:42.418
You're useless, old, damaged.

32:42.544 --> 32:43.794
We go to a bar for a drink.

32:44.254 --> 32:47.882
Now, I have the mad skills
to be scoring all the hot babes,

32:48.008 --> 32:50.676
but instead I'm spending my time wiping
drool off your chin

32:50.802 --> 32:53.804
and making sure
you don't eat the tablecloth.

32:54.473 --> 32:56.057
What's the father want to do?

32:56.892 --> 32:58.643
I don't know.

33:00.687 --> 33:02.355
So go wake him up.

33:06.485 --> 33:09.403
House, I'm so sorry.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.490
Forgot I was dying, huh?

33:12.866 --> 33:14.450
I'm here if you need me.

33:15.911 --> 33:17.370
I need you.

33:27.047 --> 33:32.677
One small feel for man,
one giant ass for mankind.

33:34.179 --> 33:35.471
Thanks.

33:36.973 --> 33:38.224
Good luck in Boston.

33:42.312 --> 33:44.730
Call
the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

33:54.032 --> 33:55.324
Dr. Foreman was just here.

33:55.742 --> 33:57.827
The seizures have
almost completely gone away.

33:57.953 --> 34:01.038
Says we might be
able to go home in the next day or two.

34:01.164 --> 34:02.832
Thank you so much.

34:02.958 --> 34:06.377
I think we should remove
the right side of your son's brain.

34:07.087 --> 34:08.921
I thought you fixed him.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.047
Does he look fixed?

34:10.257 --> 34:12.466
The right side of his brain is
keeping him walking straight.

34:12.718 --> 34:14.635
Other than that, it's been dead weight
ever since the accident.

34:14.761 --> 34:17.847
If we remove it, the seizures
would stop completely.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.849
The seizures are
hardly noticeable.

34:20.434 --> 34:21.559
They don't bother Patrick.

34:21.685 --> 34:22.935
But without the seizures,

34:23.061 --> 34:26.355
the left side would have a chance
to actually function.

34:26.732 --> 34:28.649
It could learn
to do new things.

34:28.900 --> 34:33.070
Only bummer, he'd never play
the piano again.

34:33.280 --> 34:36.615
Oh, no.
The piano is everything.

34:36.742 --> 34:38.284
I'm not saying
he's never gonna work for NASA,

34:38.410 --> 34:40.953
but flipping burgers
isn't out of the question.

34:41.079 --> 34:43.497
Well, I don't mind taking care of him
so he can play the piano.

34:43.623 --> 34:45.666
No, you're actually lucky.

34:45.876 --> 34:47.251
You don't have to
watch your kid grow up.

34:47.377 --> 34:48.669
You don't have to let go.

34:49.045 --> 34:51.046
You trying to
make this about me?

34:51.173 --> 34:54.550
I love my son,
just the way he is!

34:54.676 --> 34:56.802
He's a monkey
grinder at the circus.

34:56.928 --> 34:58.429
He's worked hard to get where he...

34:58.555 --> 34:59.555
So does the monkey.

35:02.893 --> 35:05.060
The piano is
a neurological accident.

35:05.187 --> 35:06.187
He has a gift.

35:06.313 --> 35:08.147
I'm offering him a life.

35:13.945 --> 35:15.404
It's up to you.

35:29.795 --> 35:32.338
I've isolated
the cancer proteins in House's CSF.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.215
About time.
We can't let him go to Boston

35:34.341 --> 35:36.300
if he qualifies
for the Duke trial.

35:36.426 --> 35:38.010
You want to do it?

35:53.944 --> 35:57.112
Damn. He's negative
for protein PHF.

35:57.405 --> 35:59.365
He doesn't qualify.

36:04.663 --> 36:08.499
What's that?
That shouldn't be there.

36:41.491 --> 36:42.950
Patrick?

36:47.622 --> 36:49.123
Hello, Papa.

36:52.335 --> 36:54.587
Patrick,
I have a question for you.

36:56.339 --> 36:57.798
Yes?

36:59.301 --> 37:09.018
Are you happy?

38:02.656 --> 38:04.281
House! Open up!

38:05.659 --> 38:07.701
Open up! It's important!

38:10.121 --> 38:11.956
I've got a flight
in three hours.

38:12.082 --> 38:13.874
You don't have cancer.

38:14.084 --> 38:16.961
There was an abnormal presence
of IgG and IgM, indicating...

38:17.087 --> 38:19.880
I don't have neurosyphilis.
My MRI showed nothing...

38:20.006 --> 38:22.091
It's a gumma in your brain.
It's very rare not to be in the liver,

38:22.217 --> 38:24.218
and I'm really glad
we never slept together but...

38:24.344 --> 38:25.928
We would have used a condom.

38:26.054 --> 38:27.972
And I don't have syphilis.
My VDRL was negative...

38:28.098 --> 38:29.765
We did an FTA
antibody test.

38:29.891 --> 38:31.892
The VDRL was
a false negative.

38:33.144 --> 38:35.104
You're not going to die.

38:35.230 --> 38:36.939
All you need is
IV antibiotics.

38:40.819 --> 38:43.237
Did you send these
results to Mass General?

38:43.822 --> 38:44.655
Of course.

38:46.199 --> 38:48.033
You idiots.

38:48.326 --> 38:50.494
We just told you
you're not gonna die!

38:50.704 --> 38:52.538
You should be
making out with Cameron.

38:53.790 --> 38:55.457
You knew it wasn't cancer?

38:55.583 --> 38:57.167
I was sure it was cancer.

38:57.293 --> 38:59.253
Then why aren't
you celebrating?

38:59.379 --> 39:01.839
Because it
wasn't my damn file.

39:03.466 --> 39:05.801
You faked cancer?

39:06.219 --> 39:08.262
The real patient is in
the Witherspoon wing.

39:08.388 --> 39:10.597
Feel free to tell his wife
that he's not gonna die,

39:10.724 --> 39:12.057
but he is cheating on her.

39:12.183 --> 39:13.392
Why would you want us
to think that you...

39:13.518 --> 39:14.810
I didn't!

39:14.936 --> 39:17.187
I wanted the guys in Boston
to think that I had cancer.

39:17.313 --> 39:20.024
I wanted the guys who were
gonna implant a cool drug

39:20.150 --> 39:23.235
right into the pleasure center
of my brain to think that I had cancer!

39:23.570 --> 39:26.572
You faked cancer to get high?

39:35.832 --> 39:37.499
I'm going to bed.

39:39.335 --> 39:42.087
You're right.
I don't like you.

39:42.505 --> 39:44.506
Sure. Now that I'm not dying.

40:02.776 --> 40:05.277
Heard Patrick's
hemispherectomy went well.

40:05.403 --> 40:07.613
He survived the surgery.

40:07.739 --> 40:08.739
He's unconscious but...

40:08.865 --> 40:10.532
How depressed are you?

40:10.742 --> 40:12.034
I'm not depressed.

40:12.368 --> 40:14.578
You faked cancer.

40:14.788 --> 40:17.372
It was
an outpatient procedure. I was curious.

40:17.707 --> 40:19.500
Are you curious about heroin?

40:19.626 --> 40:22.503
Not since last year's
Christmas party.

40:24.464 --> 40:25.923
I know this goes
against your nature,

40:26.049 --> 40:27.132
but can we not
make too much of this?

40:27.258 --> 40:31.136
You made people think
that you were going to die!

40:31.262 --> 40:32.346
I didn't make them.

40:32.472 --> 40:33.680
I tried to hide it,

40:33.890 --> 40:36.183
but you idiots needed to
get into my business.

40:40.438 --> 40:43.649
I'm sure I'll regret asking,
but why are you laughing?

40:44.109 --> 40:45.692
It's ironic.

40:45.944 --> 40:47.945
Well, I'm sure I'll
regret asking, but why...

40:48.071 --> 40:50.114
Depression in
cancer patients...

40:50.240 --> 40:51.615
It's not as
common as you think.

40:51.825 --> 40:53.242
It's not the dying
that gets to people.

40:53.701 --> 40:57.329
It's the dying alone. The patients
with family, with friends,

40:57.455 --> 40:58.997
they tend to do okay.

40:59.624 --> 41:01.458
You don't have cancer.

41:01.876 --> 41:03.502
You do have
people who give a damn.

41:03.628 --> 41:04.920
So what do you do?

41:07.173 --> 41:13.262
You fake the cancer,
then push the people who care away.

41:15.431 --> 41:17.432
Because they're boring.

41:19.102 --> 41:22.229
Go home to your hotel room
and laugh at that irony.

41:24.983 --> 41:27.860
Start small, House.
Take a chance.

41:28.194 --> 41:31.655
Maybe something that doesn't involve
sticking stuff in your brain.

41:31.865 --> 41:33.574
Pizza with a friend.

41:34.868 --> 41:37.369
A movie. Something.

41:56.014 --> 42:00.100
Follow my finger.
Do you know your name?

42:05.940 --> 42:08.108
His speech center
was on the right side.

42:08.693 --> 42:11.195
It'll be a while
before he's talking.

42:11.654 --> 42:15.657
He hasn't really done anything
except to stare off into the distance.

42:15.783 --> 42:17.117
It'll take some time to...

42:34.552 --> 42:36.261
You buttoned your shirt.

42:41.601 --> 42:43.310
He looks happy.
