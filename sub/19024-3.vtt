WEBVTT

00:04.120 --> 00:07.192
-Whowants another beer?
- I gotta work early tomorrow.

00:07.280 --> 00:09.316
I'm having fun,
except I had a pizza...

00:09.400 --> 00:10.913
- Elliot.
- Yes, please.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.389
- Me too, babe.
- I'll give you a hand.

00:13.480 --> 00:15.914
When you spend
most of your time in a group,

00:16.000 --> 00:18.468
if you're left alone,
it can get awkward.

00:18.560 --> 00:21.313
There can be uncomfortable silences.

00:23.560 --> 00:25.516
That was my tummy.

00:27.200 --> 00:28.758
Right.

00:28.840 --> 00:31.912
Dr Murphy, describe the presentation
of Ludwig's Angina.

00:32.040 --> 00:35.874
It's nothing compared
to the silence you hear at work.

00:35.960 --> 00:38.315
Proud to have you on board, son.

00:38.400 --> 00:40.595
I'm sending one of you
to an AMA conference

00:40.680 --> 00:43.478
where you will eat free food,
stay at a nice hotel,

00:43.560 --> 00:45.949
and try not to embarrass this hospital.

00:46.040 --> 00:50.238
I drew a name out of a hat,
and that name was Elliot Reid.

00:50.320 --> 00:52.959
Yes! I never win at anything.

00:53.040 --> 00:55.349
Then I thought...
Who cares what I thought?

00:55.440 --> 00:59.274
The point is, you're not going.
You see, it seems as though

00:59.360 --> 01:04.559
you lazybones have forgotten my edict
about residents publishing case reports.

01:04.640 --> 01:08.918
Whoever brings me the most interesting
case gets the ticket to Reno.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.275
You know, sir,
my parents live in Reno.

01:11.400 --> 01:15.359
That's great, sport.
I'm sure you'll see them over Christmas.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.150
Criminy.

01:19.240 --> 01:22.038
Not many things
make the chief of medicine move fast,

01:22.120 --> 01:25.317
but when a patient has the same
name as a wing of the hospital,

01:25.400 --> 01:27.630
you can predict Kelso's behaviour.

01:27.720 --> 01:29.995
Would you like it high up on the cheek

01:30.080 --> 01:33.231
or do you prefer
this fleshy part in the middle?

01:35.960 --> 01:39.430
I'm trying to decide
who's the most detestable suck-up here.

01:39.520 --> 01:41.875
You, this feminine guy with the perm...

01:41.960 --> 01:43.871
Mom, please.

01:43.960 --> 01:47.157
...or the one in the corner
who can't stop daydreaming.

01:53.920 --> 01:57.117
- I'm sorry, what?
- Great. Another sycophant.

01:57.200 --> 02:00.317
Listen, Molly Menopause.
I need you to quiet the hell down.

02:00.400 --> 02:02.755
You're scaring everyone in the hospital.

02:02.840 --> 02:07.595
They're delivering a baby and it's using
the umbilical cord to crawl back in.

02:07.680 --> 02:11.195
- Now, you listen to me...
- I mean it, sister.

02:11.280 --> 02:15.637
OK. From now on he's my doctor.
The rest of you can get out of here.

02:15.720 --> 02:17.278
Scram.

02:18.320 --> 02:20.311
Wait.

02:20.400 --> 02:23.472
Is that easy to manage?

02:25.000 --> 02:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:37.560 --> 02:40.996
OK. I'm Dr Cox.
This is my Gal Friday.

02:41.080 --> 02:44.436
She'll help me to take care of you.
But before we get underway,

02:44.520 --> 02:46.875
we need you
to ease up on the yakety-yak.

02:46.960 --> 02:49.030
Drop the macho act now.
They're gone.

02:49.120 --> 02:51.111
Act-schmact.
The lips stay zipped.

02:51.200 --> 02:53.668
Zipped-schmipped.
I thought we were riffing.

02:53.760 --> 02:56.320
- We're not.
- Well, aren't you delicious?

02:56.400 --> 02:59.836
If I were 20 years younger and tipsy,
this might be your lucky day.

02:59.920 --> 03:01.558
Careful there, sweetcheeks.

03:01.640 --> 03:04.791
I haven't decided which way
to take your temperature yet.

03:06.600 --> 03:08.750
She had some
real old-fashioned sass.

03:08.840 --> 03:10.876
You don't see
sass like that anymore.

03:10.960 --> 03:13.315
- Stop saying "sass."
- Sass.

03:14.640 --> 03:16.870
Dr Cox,
I have a patient with blennorrhea.

03:16.960 --> 03:22.193
Do you think that's interesting enough
to present to Dr Kelso?

03:22.280 --> 03:25.511
I'm sorry, Nervous Guy,
but I can't do your work for you.

03:25.640 --> 03:27.790
So head to the library and look it up

03:27.880 --> 03:30.713
in the New England Journal
of "Who Gives a Rat's Ass"?

03:30.800 --> 03:35.510
Leave this instant, this second,
this moment. Just go.

03:35.600 --> 03:37.477
Boy. Tell me this, muffin.

03:37.560 --> 03:40.154
You're not gonna be like
these mindless drones

03:40.240 --> 03:43.471
trying to turn the sniffles into
something more fascinating

03:43.560 --> 03:46.996
just so you're selected to go
to this stupid conference, are you?

03:47.080 --> 03:50.038
I felt I knew the right answer.

03:50.120 --> 03:52.839
- No?
- Oh, good girl.

03:54.840 --> 04:00.472
Nurse Roberts, I just saw your patient
in 1 06 and the next time you place an lV

04:00.560 --> 04:04.314
and hit the vein on the first try,
I will crack open a bottle of bubbly.

04:04.400 --> 04:08.996
I mean, my God, woman. The man
looks like Al Jarreau was his nurse.

04:09.080 --> 04:12.356
- What?
- lsn't he the blind fella?

04:12.440 --> 04:14.749
- You mean Ray Charles.
- Dammit.

04:14.840 --> 04:17.559
Anyway, you're incompetent.

04:17.640 --> 04:20.677
Easy, Laverne. You're a saved woman.

04:20.760 --> 04:23.558
Don't worry.
Tomorrow is his wedding anniversary.

04:23.640 --> 04:24.914
Why's that matter?

04:25.000 --> 04:29.118
Tomorrow, Bob Kelso will be sweeter
than flowers dipped in honey.

04:29.200 --> 04:32.351
Which is why every year
we use this time as an opportunity

04:32.440 --> 04:35.512
to ask him for anything
our department needs.

04:35.600 --> 04:38.717
- Like equipment.
- Or an extra nurse on weekends.

04:38.800 --> 04:41.075
Or a Slip 'N Slide. Who's with me?

04:41.160 --> 04:43.720
- Shut up.
- I don't get it, Dr Wen.

04:43.800 --> 04:47.429
Why would Kelso's anniversary
make him less of a jerk?

04:47.520 --> 04:52.196
Well, tonight after work, Dr Kelso will
take his wife to a candlelit dinner.

04:52.280 --> 04:56.353
Then, after they've toasted
to 40 wonderful years together,

04:56.440 --> 04:59.318
they'll go home and...

04:59.400 --> 05:02.039
I think it's sweet
that at their age they still...

05:03.800 --> 05:07.429
Then, bam! Dr Wen points to me
and now guess who has to ask Dr Kelso

05:07.520 --> 05:09.192
for a new argon laser tomorrow?

05:09.280 --> 05:12.158
- I'm sorry, baby.
- I'm out of here.

05:12.240 --> 05:15.755
- All right.
- Damn argon laser.

05:15.840 --> 05:18.513
Think we'd hang out
if it weren't for JD and Turk?

05:19.320 --> 05:22.869
Probably not. They are the one thing
we have most in common.

05:22.960 --> 05:26.316
We have a lot in common.
We have a hard time digesting dairy.

05:26.400 --> 05:29.153
You're right. Do you want
to be my maid of honour?

05:29.240 --> 05:31.754
I don't know why
you're trying to force this.

05:31.840 --> 05:35.116
We're fine. I gotta get back to work.

05:37.560 --> 05:39.869
We both work.

05:40.240 --> 05:43.118
So, have you found any cool cases yet?

05:43.200 --> 05:46.397
Muffin, I'm not gonna run around
like you mindless drones

05:46.480 --> 05:49.552
trying to turn the sniffles
into something fascinating

05:49.640 --> 05:51.756
so you can go to
some stupid conference.

05:51.840 --> 05:53.034
Schmonference.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.553
It's fun to rhyme!

05:54.640 --> 05:57.438
It's an amazing networking opportunity.

05:57.520 --> 06:00.034
Doesn't matter,
cos I've got it wrapped up.

06:00.120 --> 06:04.557
- Something better than blennorrhea?
- Doug, you would not believe it.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.309
And as you can see,
the ass is on the front.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.668
Front butt. It's like the grail.

06:17.760 --> 06:20.991
Did you say something,
Mr Too-Scared-To-Get-ln-The-Game?

06:21.120 --> 06:22.997
Don't get sucked in.

06:23.080 --> 06:25.878
You know,
I have an interesting patient, too.

06:25.960 --> 06:28.758
So basically, Mr Davis,
you received a blunt trauma

06:28.840 --> 06:31.354
to the fibrous tissue
of the corpus cavernosum.

06:31.440 --> 06:33.271
Great, and that means?

06:33.360 --> 06:35.510
You broke your penis.

06:36.440 --> 06:39.557
I can't wait to get my cast signed.

06:39.640 --> 06:42.393
Yeah, I gotta tell you,
it's such an unusual case.

06:42.480 --> 06:45.552
Would you mind if I get it
published in a medical journal?

06:45.640 --> 06:47.995
That would be fantastic.

06:48.080 --> 06:53.200
I'll let you mull it over.
And smile, Mr Davis.

06:53.280 --> 06:57.558
Tomorrow's gonna be a better day...
for everyone.

07:11.480 --> 07:13.391
Dr Kelso, happy anniversary.

07:17.040 --> 07:18.951
Excuse me, sir.

07:30.720 --> 07:33.393
Carla, I figured out
why we don't hang out more.

07:33.480 --> 07:37.359
That's great, pins and needles,
but I'm prepping a patient for surgery.

07:37.440 --> 07:40.477
She's my patient too.
I traded with Doug so we could talk.

07:40.560 --> 07:43.120
- Are you two friends?
- We're about to be.

07:43.200 --> 07:44.599
My God.

07:44.680 --> 07:48.958
You're stuck on your first impression,
that I am some spoiled brat.

07:49.040 --> 07:50.553
Elliot, not now, OK?

07:52.360 --> 07:54.476
When I was a kid
I was close with my maid.

07:54.560 --> 07:59.554
That's it. So you think that you
totally get my whole experience

07:59.640 --> 08:02.677
because of the Latina woman
who cleaned your house?

08:02.760 --> 08:05.797
- Our maid was white.
- What was her name?

08:09.480 --> 08:12.472
Consuela. You know
I don't always say the right thing.

08:12.560 --> 08:15.916
You also know how hard I'm trying,
so, we have nothing in common.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.389
I only have things in common
with nice people.

08:18.480 --> 08:21.756
You two realise
I can still hear you, right?

08:27.720 --> 08:30.837
If paediatrics needs a new bronchoscope,
you'll get one.

08:30.920 --> 08:34.230
Love to the wife and kidlets.
Who's next?

08:34.320 --> 08:36.436
Do me a favour.
Hold my place in line.

08:36.520 --> 08:38.875
- For how long?
- I don't know.

08:38.960 --> 08:41.758
Well, why? What do you have to do?

08:41.840 --> 08:44.070
Nothing. I might just veg.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.716
Try me.
I can do it with anything.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.472
- Go away.
- Go ashmay.

08:49.560 --> 08:52.677
- All right, try this one...
- Angie, put on your flats.

08:52.760 --> 08:55.069
- We're going for a walk.
- Eat shmit and die.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.435
Around here,
life can be full of surprises.

08:57.520 --> 09:01.399
Some are as simple as forgetting
something you were supposed to ask for.

09:01.480 --> 09:04.153
Dr Kelso! Is he gone?

09:07.200 --> 09:11.591
Some are so unexpected
that everyhing else takes a back seat.

09:11.680 --> 09:14.638
Sorry, I don't know what
kind of surgery you're having.

09:14.720 --> 09:18.315
I'm getting big fake breasts.

09:18.400 --> 09:20.516
Some you'd never
thought you'd hear.

09:20.600 --> 09:24.036
Newbie, I don't tell you I respect you
a lot because...I don't.

09:24.120 --> 09:25.189
I know.

09:25.280 --> 09:29.034
The fact you're not jumping through
Kelso's hoops like these peons...

09:29.120 --> 09:34.638
Yes, you. Forever you,
a thousand times you. Move. Move it.

09:34.720 --> 09:39.316
Anyway, let's make pretend
it's your birthday, because...

09:39.400 --> 09:43.075
Ah, hell, I'm impressed.
Let's get some coffee.

09:43.160 --> 09:46.755
This is great. There's only one problem.
Ten minutes ago...

09:46.840 --> 09:49.354
What the hell.
Use me in your case report.

09:49.440 --> 09:51.431
I'm going to Reno.

09:55.760 --> 09:59.389
Beg your pardon, Newbie.
What are you thinking?

09:59.480 --> 10:03.268
- Not about Reno.
- Attagirl. Let's go.

10:11.560 --> 10:13.949
With every sip of the coffee
Dr Cox bought me,

10:14.040 --> 10:17.237
I could taste my own hypocrisy.

10:17.320 --> 10:20.551
Thank God my hypocrisy missed me.

10:20.640 --> 10:23.950
I wanted you to stand in line for me
cos I need a new mop.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.679
The floors are slippery
cos this one doesn't work.

10:26.760 --> 10:29.752
- You know why it doesn't work?
- It's out of mop gas?

10:29.840 --> 10:34.231
No. Cos it's so old it won't
soak up water. See?

10:35.520 --> 10:38.671
Something in that filthy mop water
woke me up.

10:38.760 --> 10:42.230
I decided I could have my cake
and eat it too.

10:42.320 --> 10:43.799
Dr Cox would never know.

10:43.880 --> 10:46.314
What do you say, Bridge Club?
How you feeling?

10:46.400 --> 10:48.595
Like crap.
What the hell's wrong with me?

10:48.680 --> 10:51.353
Your abdominal pains
suggest biliary disease,

10:51.440 --> 10:54.750
but your tests came back negative,
so we don't know.

10:54.840 --> 10:57.798
But don't worry.
Dr Cox and I never say die.

10:57.880 --> 11:01.714
Unless someone actually dies.
Then we're forced to by law.

11:01.800 --> 11:05.679
- He's talking again.
- Oh, come on. The kid's OK.

11:05.760 --> 11:07.671
"The kid"? This is great.

11:07.760 --> 11:09.716
Why haven't I heard your name before?

11:09.800 --> 11:13.554
I've only been here a year, and
he's just started calling me "the kid."

11:13.640 --> 11:15.835
- Which I love.
- She's talking to me.

11:15.920 --> 11:17.911
You should be more
than an attending.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.390
- Let me make a phone call.
- I'm not so good with handouts.

11:21.480 --> 11:23.357
I'm only putting in a good word.

11:23.480 --> 11:28.031
Bubby, if you want to help me, why don't
you quiet down and get some rest?

11:28.120 --> 11:34.355
If you're a really good girl, I'll wind
up your car and take you to a talkie.

11:34.440 --> 11:36.749
I could do naughty things
to that man.

11:36.840 --> 11:40.515
Uncomfortable.

11:40.600 --> 11:44.275
- You're getting fake breasts?
- Stripper big.

11:44.360 --> 11:48.114
Forgive me, Mrs Kellerman,
but why wait until now to do this?

11:48.200 --> 11:51.078
- Cos you're so old.
- Yeah, Elliot, she gets that.

11:51.160 --> 11:54.152
Yeah, I know.
I'm sure she gets it all the time.

11:54.240 --> 11:58.597
Look, I've been self-conscious my whole
life and I finally got the courage.

11:58.680 --> 12:02.912
Can you honestly say there's nothing
you'd change about yourself?

12:03.000 --> 12:05.639
- I can honestly say that.
- Me too.

12:05.720 --> 12:08.996
- Then you're both liars.
- Hey, Mrs K.

12:09.080 --> 12:12.789
Let's get you into a fresh pair
of blouse bunnies.

12:12.880 --> 12:16.589
To hell with this "there's only
one day to ask Kelso" thing.

12:16.680 --> 12:20.355
Shoot, I'm getting
that argon laser today.

12:34.120 --> 12:36.031
Dr Kelso...

12:41.640 --> 12:43.471
So uncalled...

12:44.480 --> 12:46.311
- What?
- Nothing.

12:49.040 --> 12:51.838
- And you?
- I don't want anything from you.

12:51.920 --> 12:55.117
That's what my son says,
but when Mother's Day rolls around,

12:55.200 --> 12:58.078
guess who wants to go halfsies
on a pasta pot for Enid?

12:58.160 --> 13:00.390
She's not my mother, dammit.

13:00.480 --> 13:04.917
And don't think I've forgotten that
you have yet to turn in a case report.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.355
You have until six.

13:07.440 --> 13:09.351
You can't just change your mind.

13:09.440 --> 13:12.238
I'm sorry. Did I pass out
from the pain in my penis

13:12.320 --> 13:15.312
and suddenly
we're not in America anymore?

13:15.400 --> 13:18.153
Crap.

13:18.240 --> 13:20.629
- What's this?
- It's a mop.

13:20.720 --> 13:23.473
Yeah, I got that. I mean,
why'd you get it for me?

13:23.560 --> 13:27.473
Cos I thought it would be nice.
Why? Don't you like it?

13:29.880 --> 13:32.474
Well?

13:40.520 --> 13:42.112
Hang on.

13:42.200 --> 13:44.998
Man, today could not get any worse.

13:45.080 --> 13:49.278
If you were to change one thing about
my appearance, what would it be?

13:49.360 --> 13:51.555
You're testing me. I get it.

13:51.640 --> 13:55.758
You know I don't like you talking to God
when we're trying to have a discussion.

13:55.840 --> 13:59.753
Now, if I were to be
really honest with myself,

13:59.840 --> 14:04.072
I would change everything.
What do you think?

14:04.160 --> 14:05.991
Why don't we just skip what I think

14:06.080 --> 14:09.959
and jump right ahead
to not having sex for a month?

14:10.040 --> 14:11.951
Are all women this crazy?

14:12.040 --> 14:14.600
I hate my cheeks. Suck them in.

14:14.680 --> 14:16.477
I'll take some of that.

14:16.560 --> 14:20.155
That's right, work it baby.
Now you're smoking.

14:21.800 --> 14:23.472
God, I'm hideous.

14:23.560 --> 14:27.519
Good news, Mrs Warner. We got
a pretty good idea what's going on...

14:27.600 --> 14:31.991
So I don't have a case to present.
At least this way we get to stay a team.

14:32.080 --> 14:35.231
It turns out the EGD
showed multiple erosive peptic ulcers,

14:35.320 --> 14:37.788
and the secretin injection test
was positive,

14:37.880 --> 14:41.759
which suggests you have gastrinomatous
Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.114
In English, please.

14:43.200 --> 14:46.510
Your stomach acid
is eroding your own intestines.

14:46.600 --> 14:49.433
It's remarkable.
I've never seen anything like it.

14:49.520 --> 14:52.159
- Newbie, you?
- No.

14:52.240 --> 14:55.869
I realised Mrs Warner was the
most interesting case in the hospital.

14:55.960 --> 14:57.598
The whole thing's treatable.

14:57.680 --> 15:01.116
We're going to step outside
and then we'll get underway.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.634
- Newbie, what do you say?
- I had to go for it.

15:03.720 --> 15:07.190
If you give me a second,
I wanna ask Mrs Warner something.

15:07.280 --> 15:10.397
- What?
- To marry me.

15:10.480 --> 15:12.675
Come on, heel toe. What do you say, kid?

15:20.480 --> 15:23.790
Mrs Warner, would you give me
permission to present your case

15:23.880 --> 15:25.791
to be published in a medical journal

15:25.880 --> 15:28.519
so that I might be chosen
to go to an AMA conference?

15:28.600 --> 15:32.798
- Sure, why not?
- Thanks.

15:32.880 --> 15:34.791
Excuse me.

15:39.280 --> 15:41.874
Dr Kelso,
can I have a minute of your time?

15:41.960 --> 15:44.679
Oh, for God's sake, son.
I have two more days of peace

15:44.760 --> 15:48.469
before my wife returns from fat camp.

15:48.560 --> 15:52.633
I need an argon laser, and I was gonna
ask you yesterday, but then... Hold up.

15:52.720 --> 15:55.518
How can you make love
to your wife if she's at fat camp?

15:55.600 --> 15:58.990
How can I make love to her
when she's not at fat camp?

15:59.080 --> 16:03.915
- Sir, you lied to us.
- I'm Bob Kelso. Nice to meet you.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.958
Look, sport, if people think
I'm only giving once a year,

16:07.040 --> 16:09.918
they'll only be asking me
for things once a year.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.515
Get out of my eye line.
Nurse Tidsdale is wearing ankle socks.

16:15.360 --> 16:18.193
How about I don't?
And how about you help me out

16:18.280 --> 16:20.475
and I won't tell anybody about this?

16:20.560 --> 16:26.795
Unless you like it when people come
and ask you for stuff every single day.

16:29.760 --> 16:32.672
Fat camp.
Six years she's been going there,

16:32.760 --> 16:35.320
and the only thing
getting thinner is my wallet.

16:40.120 --> 16:43.795
- Is JD here?
- No, it's just me.

16:45.040 --> 16:47.156
I guess I'll just wait too.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.629
- Crap.
- Fine. I'll wait outside.

16:49.720 --> 16:54.669
No, I was talking to my hair.
If it's even the least bit humid,

16:54.760 --> 16:56.716
all of a sudden I'm Doctor J.

16:56.800 --> 17:00.270
Is he in radiology?

17:00.360 --> 17:02.271
Yeah.

17:04.800 --> 17:07.997
Carla, you know,
I would kill for your hair.

17:08.079 --> 17:11.038
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:11.119 --> 17:14.351
- I would kill for your legs.
- I would kill for your lips.

17:14.440 --> 17:17.318
I'd kill for that wagon you're draggin'.

17:17.400 --> 17:20.756
- That's your butt.
- Thank you.

17:22.240 --> 17:24.356
- Wagon?
- Draggin'.

17:25.880 --> 17:31.432
I won! Thank you, Mrs Warner!
In your face! In your face! In your...

17:33.800 --> 17:37.031
-...face.
- Congratulations.

17:37.120 --> 17:41.432
You get to represent the Kelso Kennel
Club at the big show in Reno.

17:41.520 --> 17:44.432
Remember when you are prancing
in front of the judges

17:44.520 --> 17:47.671
to keep that shaved behind of yours
held up nice and high,

17:47.760 --> 17:49.751
Iike the proud puppy that you are.

17:49.840 --> 17:52.195
When it comes time
to hand out blue ribbons,

17:52.280 --> 17:55.033
it will be such an exciting time
for you.

17:55.120 --> 17:58.157
But for the love of God, Newbie,
you've gotta try, try, try

17:58.240 --> 18:00.629
not to squeeze out a dookie
on the Astroturf.

18:00.720 --> 18:06.750
Cos... I mean, God forbid you were ever
an embarrassment to Master Bob, right?

18:08.400 --> 18:11.312
You know, I don't care what you think.

18:11.400 --> 18:13.630
- Yeah, you do.
- I know.

18:16.760 --> 18:21.914
Look, I wanna be like you...
but a more successful you.

18:23.120 --> 18:27.113
There's nothing wrong
with playing the game once in a while.

18:27.200 --> 18:30.954
Ten years from now when I'm your boss,
I'll throw in a good word for you,

18:31.040 --> 18:34.476
and you won't even have to ask...

18:34.560 --> 18:36.039
...sir.

18:41.680 --> 18:46.196
I like to think your life comes
down to the choices you've made.

18:46.320 --> 18:49.551
Like the choice
to stand up to a superior.

18:55.760 --> 19:00.151
Or to focus on what you have
in common instead of what you don 't.

19:07.120 --> 19:11.113
Or the choice
to let someone help you for once.

19:15.720 --> 19:18.359
In the end,
you just have to trust your decisions.

19:18.440 --> 19:21.159
You're the husband?
We gotta get you bigger hands.

19:21.240 --> 19:23.549
And hopefully
you'll land on solid ground.

19:26.360 --> 19:29.113
- Well, what about your new mop?
- I like my old one.

19:29.200 --> 19:32.715
- But you cried.
- No, that was you.

19:36.160 --> 19:38.071
It was a good one.
