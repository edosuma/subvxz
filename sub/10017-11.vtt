01:00.100 --> 01:01.431
Excuse me.

01:08.475 --> 01:09.601
Sorry, Jerry.

01:09.811 --> 01:12.041
-l'm sorry.
-That's all right.

01:13.381 --> 01:16.009
l should've got cross-country skis.

01:16.818 --> 01:19.753
Still 1 7 shopping days
left till Christmas.

01:20.488 --> 01:21.854
Slow day?

01:22.156 --> 01:24.250
Not a single patient!

01:34.603 --> 01:36.662
l feel like l'm in camp.

01:39.109 --> 01:41.542
l love the first big snowstorm.

01:41.744 --> 01:44.339
-Did Jen get out okay?
-She left yesterday.

01:44.547 --> 01:47.072
-l thought she had till Wednesday.
-She went early.

01:47.250 --> 01:48.979
Early?

01:50.021 --> 01:51.544
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

01:52.522 --> 01:54.354
l don't wanna talk about it.

01:54.591 --> 01:56.253
They why'd you bring it up?

01:58.396 --> 01:59.727
Towel clip.

02:01.599 --> 02:02.861
Towel clip.

02:05.469 --> 02:06.993
Why are we doing this?

02:07.205 --> 02:10.436
Because sticking his hand
in a bucket of warm water...

02:10.640 --> 02:12.269
...would be juvenile.

02:18.817 --> 02:19.977
Jeez!

02:21.153 --> 02:22.780
Mom, get out of my room.

02:27.460 --> 02:28.824
<i>It's a mess out there.</i>

02:29.027 --> 02:32.053
<i>This storm began in the Rockies,
crept across the plains...</i>

02:32.264 --> 02:33.994
<i>...and landed on the Midwest...</i>

02:34.199 --> 02:37.033
<i>...dumping seven inches of snow
on the ground before dawn.</i>

02:37.236 --> 02:40.228
<i>The latest estimate puts
the total at close to 9 inches.</i>

02:40.441 --> 02:44.103
<i>That left the morning rush hour
looking like a demolition derby.</i>

02:45.579 --> 02:47.945
What's a four-letter word
for ''possessions''?

02:48.147 --> 02:49.672
''Stuff.''

02:49.883 --> 02:51.646
That's five letters.

02:52.586 --> 02:55.851
Roxanne, temp clerks do
answer the phone.

02:56.056 --> 02:57.853
l thought you were going home.

02:58.058 --> 03:00.185
My car's snowed in. l'm stuck.

03:00.394 --> 03:01.657
Nurse call.

03:01.863 --> 03:04.798
You know that blue flu
the cops get sick with?

03:04.999 --> 03:06.933
She thinks she caught it.

03:12.507 --> 03:13.668
Bob.

03:14.242 --> 03:17.643
Why don't you relax?
lt's just gonna get dirty again.

03:17.847 --> 03:21.078
All the reason more
to keep the foot up on it.

03:21.283 --> 03:23.342
Leg. Leg up on it.

03:24.453 --> 03:27.115
Do you want to help put up
the Christmas ornaments?

03:27.323 --> 03:28.654
Ornaments?

03:34.931 --> 03:36.557
He's kind of cute.

03:36.765 --> 03:40.964
-Really?
-He's got beautiful eyes, thick hair.

03:41.171 --> 03:42.604
That's a low blow.

03:43.573 --> 03:45.040
-What's going on?
-Nothing.

03:45.242 --> 03:46.869
We're just taking inventory.

03:47.078 --> 03:49.773
Gurney number A-7403.

03:49.981 --> 03:52.608
You can go back to sleep, okay?

03:58.890 --> 04:03.157
<i>This could turn into the biggest
snowstorm since January of 1 967...</i>

04:03.361 --> 04:05.727
<i>...when 23 inches fell in 28 hours.</i>

04:05.930 --> 04:08.297
<i>The last half-hour
alone brought us....</i>

04:08.500 --> 04:11.663
-What happened to the security camera?
-Somebody stole it.

04:11.870 --> 04:14.668
-Are you ready?
-Yeah, yeah. Go get everybody.

04:14.873 --> 04:16.704
Jerry, how does this work?

04:17.276 --> 04:19.211
lt's really pretty simple.

04:22.248 --> 04:24.239
Sorry, sorry. l got it.

04:24.651 --> 04:26.083
All right. Come on.

04:32.158 --> 04:33.147
Hit it.

04:36.029 --> 04:38.020
Dr. Carter, stat, Trauma 1 .

04:38.231 --> 04:41.291
Dr. Carter, stat, Trauma 1 .

04:56.518 --> 04:57.746
Very funny.

05:45.303 --> 05:46.429
No!

05:50.375 --> 05:51.740
That hurt!

05:54.512 --> 05:55.911
You cheat.

06:00.286 --> 06:02.151
-Hey, Carol!
-Don't you dare.

06:02.354 --> 06:04.549
-Slow morning, huh?
-lt's dead.

06:04.756 --> 06:07.624
Never say ''dead'' to a charge nurse.

06:10.029 --> 06:12.930
<i>We're in ER
And it's snowing outside</i>

06:13.133 --> 06:15.794
<i>Brothers in the C-town
Are ready to die</i>

06:16.001 --> 06:18.232
<i>91 1 ain't gonna be your ride</i>

06:18.438 --> 06:21.964
<i>Because G's be chilling
On the nasty South Side</i>

06:45.966 --> 06:49.231
That's fat.
Come up on that grip.

06:49.937 --> 06:53.772
You gotta raise up out that
sorry peach gear, though, man.

06:56.912 --> 06:57.936
What?

06:58.180 --> 06:59.169
He likes it.

06:59.381 --> 07:02.647
<i>Because the G's be chilling
On the nasty South Side</i>

07:19.168 --> 07:21.865
The reindeer pull the sleigh.

07:22.806 --> 07:24.171
Of course.

07:24.474 --> 07:25.463
Of course.

07:25.676 --> 07:29.772
-Do you have reindeer in Poland?
-Yes, many. Many.

07:35.719 --> 07:37.584
No! No!

07:39.723 --> 07:41.418
Well, pranksters...

07:41.625 --> 07:43.616
...l can't seem to get this off.

07:44.462 --> 07:46.828
You have to let it dry first.

07:48.233 --> 07:49.257
l'm going to bed.

07:49.467 --> 07:52.163
-No, Lydia!

Okay, okay.

Hey, guys.

08:37.418 --> 08:39.409
John Taglieri and l

08:46.295 --> 08:47.626
That's great. Congratulations.

08:48.129 --> 08:49.289
Thanks.

08:55.704 --> 08:56.728
How was Jamaica?

08:57.139 --> 08:59.404
The Bahamas. lt was fabulous.

08:59.609 --> 09:02.510
-We went windsurfing.
-And l got sunburned.

09:02.712 --> 09:05.407
-The snorkeling was incredible!
-Lots of jellyfish.

09:06.883 --> 09:08.748
You'll tell them

Groin pull?

09:12.188 --> 09:15.954
Hey, congratulations again.
You guys are gonna be very happy.

l'm gonna go take a nap.

09:21.397 --> 09:23.059
Call me later, okay?

09:24.635 --> 09:27.696
His idea of a perfect vacation
is to lie on a deck chair...

09:27.905 --> 09:29.840
...with one of those parasol drinks.

09:30.608 --> 09:32.269
lt sounds pretty good to me.

09:38.516 --> 09:39.642

You might want to....

09:47.059 --> 09:48.423

09:48.961 --> 09:50.484
Never mind.

09:51.030 --> 09:53.897
<i>And it's getting worse.
Our usual monthly snowfall....</i>

09:54.100 --> 09:59.037
lf you had an alien baby, would it
show up on the pregnancy test?

10:05.979 --> 10:07.241
ER.

10:09.682 --> 10:11.480
Calm down, Mr. Blinker.

10:11.851 --> 10:13.911
When's the baby's due date?

10:15.689 --> 10:18.181
How far apart are the contractions?

10:20.161 --> 10:22.993
Call 91 1 now.

10:25.567 --> 10:28.195
Mrs. Blinker doesn't want
to come into the hospital.

10:28.403 --> 10:31.463
She wants to deliver
watching the snowfall.

10:31.673 --> 10:34.506
She'd enjoy the snowfall more
with an epidural.

10:35.344 --> 10:39.212
<i>County General, this is dispatch

11:05.476 --> 11:09.742
Probably an F-Sl1 ,
platinum setting.

11:10.280 --> 11:12.305
That's a $ 1 2,000 ring.

11:20.224 --> 11:23.558
You are here to work. Get up.

11:23.762 --> 11:25.730
No patients, no work.

There is always work around.

11:28.033 --> 11:31.331
Empty the wastebaskets and
reline them with plastic bags.

11:31.535 --> 11:32.730

15:06.698 --> 15:09.064
Let's green-tag him

17:29.549 --> 17:31.949
Two fingers.
Now what do you see?

17:32.152 --> 17:34.620
Such a rock! Lucky girl.

17:34.821 --> 17:37.722
Double-patch her eye and
green-tag her to the waiting room.

17:37.924 --> 17:40.119
What? Did l say something?

17:43.263 --> 17:44.423
Where's Carter?

17:44.632 --> 17:47.294
Where have you been?
Grab some scissors. Move.

17:47.501 --> 17:49.026
How soon can she go up?

17:49.237 --> 17:51.967
When l get her pictures,
have the orthopods look at her.

17:52.173 --> 17:54.836
We need the room.
The O.R.'s opened up.

17:55.043 --> 17:58.501
People, you heard the boss.
Let's heal them and wheel them.

17:59.882 --> 18:02.214

18:09.591 --> 18:10.957
Yes. How are you feeling?

18:11.160 --> 18:13.594
Haven't been tied up
since last Saturday night.

18:13.797 --> 18:18.166
Thank you for sharing, Mr. Kaplan.

18:22.005 --> 18:25.908
ER, please hold.
Shoot me if l take this job again.

18:26.109 --> 18:28.202
Give me a gun, l'll shoot you now.

18:31.215 --> 18:35.878
Call Fire Station 23. See if they
can pick up these docs stuck at home.

18:37.021 --> 18:39.319
Smoke inhalation.
Yellow-tag him to Curtain 2.

18:39.523 --> 18:41.718
-You got it.
-What do you got?

18:41.926 --> 18:43.757
-l hurt my hand.
-Let me see.

18:43.961 --> 18:46.486
-Where's your thumb?
-lt's right here.

18:46.697 --> 18:50.532
All right. Malik!
Red-tag him straight to the O.R.

18:50.735 --> 18:52.635
Here's his thumb. Take him.

18:57.676 --> 19:00.373
Mrs. Thui, everything's fine.

19:00.579 --> 19:02.309
Everything's fine. Relax.

19:02.515 --> 19:03.879
You okay?

19:09.388 --> 19:12.915
l found her lying out in the snow.
No idea who she belongs to.

19:13.159 --> 19:15.252
-Kid's got a set of lungs.
-Go!

19:16.028 --> 19:18.690
Dexter Jones, 25.
Van rolled on him. No seat belt.

19:18.898 --> 19:22.528
Left below-the-knee amputation.
He left a few pints in the snow.

19:22.736 --> 19:25.637
Rescue 7 is looking
for the rest of his leg.

19:26.073 --> 19:29.133
Benton done in 2?
Okay, here's his next patient.

19:29.343 --> 19:33.973
lf they come at you with that Foley
catheter, run, Jack. Don't walk!

19:34.348 --> 19:36.613
Take him up.
O.R. 2 is prepped for him.

19:36.818 --> 19:39.651
When the cross-matched
blood's here, send it up.

19:41.421 --> 19:43.913
Code in seven! Code in seven!

20:06.348 --> 20:08.509
Run those to Benton in Trauma 1 .

20:09.485 --> 20:10.885
Go, Mookie!

20:24.902 --> 20:26.425
Put me out!

20:26.636 --> 20:28.969
We can't put you out.
You've hit your head.

20:29.173 --> 20:32.006
Get the lab for a CBC,
type and cross. Let's move.

20:32.210 --> 20:33.234
Bring those in!

20:33.678 --> 20:35.305

20:35.513 --> 20:36.878
Come on, bring those pads in!

20:37.082 --> 20:39.777
Put this on. All hands on deck.
Let's move.

20:40.918 --> 20:42.613
Put your hand on the tourniquet!

20:42.820 --> 20:45.153
Come on! l'll make
a surgeon out of you yet.

20:47.192 --> 20:50.218
97.8, 90 over 50...

20:50.429 --> 20:53.228
...pulse 1 25.
Pretty darned normal.

20:53.432 --> 20:54.421
Doug!

20:55.834 --> 20:57.597
Please, help me!

21:00.206 --> 21:03.334
-Gas tank exploded. Trapped in the car.
-DO A.

21:03.543 --> 21:06.637
Mr. Ramos. Vitals, normal.
Multiple contusions and abrasions.

21:06.846 --> 21:09.007
Does it hurt when l do this?

21:09.216 --> 21:11.377
Okay, let me see, all right?

21:12.319 --> 21:14.149
All right, Exam 3.

21:14.355 --> 21:18.314
Green-tag him to the doctor's lounge.
Here we go.

21:18.826 --> 21:20.817
All right, duck your head.

21:22.062 --> 21:24.929
Here we go, straight back now.
Straight back.

22:49.521 --> 22:50.510
Patrick...

22:50.723 --> 22:52.487
...how did you get here?

22:53.226 --> 22:55.285
-l walked.
-Why?

22:55.595 --> 22:58.564
l don't have a driver's license.

22:58.765 --> 23:00.790
Oh, okay.

23:02.736 --> 23:05.262
They look better
when they're straight.

23:05.438 --> 23:07.998
-They do. You're right.
-Carol!

23:08.209 --> 23:11.974
<i>-Go to it, Patrick. Go to it.
-Si, señorita.</i>

23:15.549 --> 23:17.380
How are we doing in here?

23:18.152 --> 23:19.211
Ahead of the Reaper.

23:19.420 --> 23:21.684
That's all you can ask for.
Thanks for the ride.

23:21.889 --> 23:22.947
You bet.

23:24.158 --> 23:25.490
Run it down for me, Mark.

23:25.694 --> 23:29.026
A 40-car pileup on the Kennedy.
We're the major receiving.

23:29.230 --> 23:31.324
Eighteen red tags, 1 0 have gone up.

23:31.533 --> 23:34.400
Nineteen yellows,
33 greens logged in.

23:34.603 --> 23:37.902
Three DO As,
four black tags didn't make it.

23:38.106 --> 23:42.476
Six O.R.s are operational
and fire's out bringing in fresh docs.

23:42.678 --> 23:45.271
Good. Go be a doc.

23:46.149 --> 23:48.811
O.R., Morgenstern.
l need a staff status update.

23:49.986 --> 23:54.252
Aliens have implanted
a detector in my nose!

23:56.527 --> 23:59.188
Doctor, hey! Aliens have--

23:59.395 --> 24:03.628
Why today, Regina? Carol, page Cvetic,
get him down here right away.

24:03.834 --> 24:08.396
Let's give her a nice quiet room
and five of vitamin H.

24:08.606 --> 24:12.507
That's Haldol!
This detects abbreviations.

24:12.710 --> 24:14.540
What a zoo!

24:14.746 --> 24:17.909
Steve, take the officer
and give him some stitches.

24:18.116 --> 24:21.108
-l haven't done that since l interned.
-lt's like riding a bike.

24:21.319 --> 24:23.082
l haven't done that since l was 6.

24:23.288 --> 24:24.653
l'm Angela Hicks.

24:24.857 --> 24:27.290
Hey, hi. l'm Dr. Ross.

24:27.492 --> 24:29.927
Listen, why don't you
take bedpan detail?

24:30.129 --> 24:32.222
lt's not glamorous,
but very necessary.

24:32.430 --> 24:35.127
That's Dr. Hicks.
l'm the new attending ER physician.

24:36.836 --> 24:39.236
Well, you won't be needing these then.

24:49.748 --> 24:52.081
l don't want this life!
Why you give me this life?!

24:52.252 --> 24:54.049
Pulse is falling.

24:55.322 --> 24:58.655
Bad news.
PCO-2's 62. PO-2, 60.

24:58.859 --> 25:02.727
All right, let's crash intubate him.
Get the sux, Pavulon and Versed.

25:02.929 --> 25:05.592
-Let's move, people.
-Hold tight, Mookie. Hold him tight.

25:06.867 --> 25:08.529
Come on, man. Calm down.

25:08.736 --> 25:09.794
B?

25:10.304 --> 25:11.293
Dexter?

25:11.973 --> 25:14.135
l know him from the neighborhood.
Move!

25:14.342 --> 25:16.742
Don't do no lndiana Jones on me, B!

25:17.712 --> 25:18.770
Versed first?

25:18.980 --> 25:20.948
Two milligrams, then succinylcholine.

25:21.148 --> 25:23.116
Dex, listen to me, baby.
Listen to me.

25:23.318 --> 25:26.913
Dex, l got you, okay? Come on.

25:29.825 --> 25:32.123
l got you, okay? l got you.

25:32.328 --> 25:34.421
Would somebody sign
my time card, please?

25:36.399 --> 25:37.423
lt's been 8 hours.

25:37.634 --> 25:39.100
Get her out of here.

25:41.337 --> 25:43.305
Get a suction cap too.

25:46.776 --> 25:48.472
-Where does it hurt?
-My chest.

25:48.679 --> 25:52.375
-Did you hit the steering wheel?
-l was trying to light a cigarette.

25:52.883 --> 25:54.874
That's the cigarette lighter?

25:55.853 --> 25:59.584
Dr. Ross, is that old Cuban guy,
Ramos supposed to be dead?

26:02.159 --> 26:04.754
He was fine 1 0 minutes ago.

26:05.162 --> 26:07.563
He complained of chest pains
and went out.

26:07.766 --> 26:10.359
Damn it! Let me in.
l got it. Trauma 2.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.901
l just fell cross-country skiing.

26:13.104 --> 26:16.096
-l'll get you an ice pack.
-Just how long will l have to wait?

26:16.274 --> 26:20.837
Come on, Mr. Ramos! l green-tagged him
to the waiting room. He seemed fine.

26:21.146 --> 26:22.135
Come on!

26:22.614 --> 26:23.603
Where're we going?

26:23.816 --> 26:25.476
-Trauma 2.
-Damn!

26:25.885 --> 26:26.977
Come on.

26:35.361 --> 26:37.625
Does that look like
a fracture to you?

26:37.931 --> 26:40.490
Yeah. Trimalleolar.
Call Ortho.

26:40.801 --> 26:44.999
lf you throw a deep dermal in and
trim that edge, it'll line up better.

26:45.205 --> 26:46.194
Yeah?

26:46.907 --> 26:47.965
Thanks.

26:50.510 --> 26:53.741
Dietary? We've got an ER
full of hungry people.

26:54.648 --> 26:55.637
Damn.

26:58.685 --> 26:59.674
ER.

27:00.288 --> 27:01.414
l'll tell her.

27:01.623 --> 27:03.147
Carlos? Linda from Novell.

27:03.358 --> 27:06.691
l need 30 large pizzas
delivered to County ER.

27:06.894 --> 27:11.695
l know it's snowing. Well, get
a move on and charge it to my account.

27:17.972 --> 27:19.463
Peekaboo!

27:20.109 --> 27:21.736
Peekaboo!

27:22.277 --> 27:24.040
Peekaboo!

27:24.314 --> 27:28.444
-So where's the doctor?
-l am the doctor, Mrs. Bozinsky.

27:28.851 --> 27:30.876
No, l mean a ''doctor'' doctor.

27:31.186 --> 27:33.086
Myra, let her do her job.

27:33.289 --> 27:34.779
Where are you feeling pain?

27:34.991 --> 27:37.983
l want Dr. Harvey Stern
called this minute.

27:38.194 --> 27:40.856
Perhaps you'd be more comfortable
in the waiting room.

27:41.064 --> 27:42.258
That's a good one!

27:42.466 --> 27:44.262
You go call Harvey, Myra.

27:44.468 --> 27:47.095
A pay phone's just past
the admit desk.

27:47.303 --> 27:51.673
BP's okay.
Pulse is a little high, 1 20.

27:51.876 --> 27:55.778
l don't know if his cap refill's what
it should be. Do postural vitals.

27:55.980 --> 27:58.881
Are you sure when l push here
this isn't hurting you?

27:59.083 --> 28:01.518
l'll run another 300cc fluid check.

28:11.963 --> 28:14.797
He didn't say a word about
abdominal pain. He bled out.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.059
Let's turn off that music!

28:17.837 --> 28:21.102
Put that blood on a pump.
Try high-dose epi, 3 milligrams.

28:21.306 --> 28:24.037
-Another milligram of atropine?
-Another milligram.

28:24.243 --> 28:25.335
He's flatlined.

28:25.545 --> 28:27.604
Let me in there.
Come on, move!

28:27.814 --> 28:30.112
Let's hook him up
to the external pacemaker.

28:30.316 --> 28:31.408
Come on.

28:31.952 --> 28:34.681
Mr. Blinker? Hang on.

28:34.888 --> 28:36.856
-lt's the guy--
-Pacer's not capturing.

28:37.057 --> 28:40.026
-Turn up the damn gain!
-lt's up all the way.

28:40.227 --> 28:43.162
After you broke down the door,
what did you find?

28:43.363 --> 28:47.299
You're bigger than her, right?
Then carry her in here yourself.

28:48.402 --> 28:50.370
His wife locked herself
in the bedroom...

28:50.571 --> 28:53.336
...put a sock into her mouth
so she wouldn't scream.

28:53.540 --> 28:55.735
She really wants
to have that baby at home.

28:55.944 --> 28:57.002
Come on.

29:01.116 --> 29:04.313
-Anybody here with him?
-Family's on the way.

29:06.122 --> 29:07.419
Pupils fixed and dilated.

29:07.622 --> 29:09.886
Patrick got into the Christmas tapes.

29:10.659 --> 29:12.058
Come on!

29:15.064 --> 29:16.088
Doug...

29:17.867 --> 29:19.835
...it's been 30 minutes.

29:20.770 --> 29:22.204
Let's call it.

29:24.940 --> 29:28.274
Damn it!
Green-tagged him by mistake.

29:43.427 --> 29:46.224
He's the last of them.
Mr. Thui.

29:47.865 --> 29:48.889
Thui....

29:50.635 --> 29:54.036
Oh, Mr. Thui, we took
very good care of your wife.

29:54.238 --> 29:56.799
She's been sedated
and she's resting comfortably.

29:57.008 --> 30:01.206
l do not understand.
She wasn't in the accident with me.

30:02.781 --> 30:06.308
She was home.
l called her to come pick me up.

30:06.519 --> 30:07.678
Wait. What?

30:22.101 --> 30:23.500
l missed it.

30:23.737 --> 30:27.901
You triaged 70-odd patients.
You're human, Doug.

30:29.142 --> 30:30.473
Doctors...

30:31.111 --> 30:32.635
...may l?

30:33.914 --> 30:34.903
Yes.

30:46.161 --> 30:47.992
My brother in faith...

30:48.495 --> 30:51.363
...l entrust you to God
who created you.

30:51.566 --> 30:54.296
May you return to the One
who formed you...

30:54.502 --> 30:56.561
...from the dust of this earth.

30:58.673 --> 31:00.766
My brother in faith...

31:01.043 --> 31:03.876
...l entrust you to God
who created you.

31:04.080 --> 31:07.049
May you return to the One
who formed you...

31:07.250 --> 31:09.241
...from the dust of this earth.

31:10.720 --> 31:13.382
Out of the depths,
l've cried unto Thee.

31:13.589 --> 31:15.523
Lord, hear my voice.

31:15.725 --> 31:19.253
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

31:19.529 --> 31:23.556
Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

31:26.703 --> 31:29.695
Let's hook this up to the suction.
Let's move.

31:29.907 --> 31:34.140
You think the vascular boys can put
Humpty Dumpty back together again?

31:34.345 --> 31:35.834
They're in with that thumb.

31:36.046 --> 31:39.744
You know, Dexter's always been
a magnet for bad luck.

31:39.951 --> 31:41.942
l'm Dr. Hicks.
Give me the bullet.

31:42.153 --> 31:44.951
<i>Left B-K amputation.
Estimated blood loss, 40%.</i>

31:45.156 --> 31:48.388
Bilateral hemothorax.
750cc's from right thoracostomy.

31:48.594 --> 31:52.188
Rapid sequence induction, Versed,
succinylcholine, Pavulon...

31:52.398 --> 31:56.231
...4 liters Ringer's, 6 units O-neg in.
C-spine cleared, vitals stabilized.

31:56.535 --> 31:58.400
Benton, right?
l've heard about you.

31:58.604 --> 32:00.402
Oh, yeah?
ls that good or bad?

32:00.606 --> 32:03.166
-He's in fib!
-Charge the defibrillator, 200.

32:03.576 --> 32:06.773
Excuse me, just how much longer
am l gonna have to wait?

32:08.047 --> 32:09.207
Clear!

32:11.985 --> 32:15.113
-BP's falling. l get 60.
-His crit's down.

32:15.322 --> 32:17.313
Run them in, fast.

32:17.525 --> 32:20.790
Did Dr. Stern tell you
that you have an aortic aneurysm?

32:21.127 --> 32:23.391
-l don't feel a femoral pulse.
-He had one.

32:23.764 --> 32:26.790
Doctor, please, do something!

32:28.035 --> 32:29.434
Let's get him in the O.R.

32:29.637 --> 32:31.605
-Nobody's available.
-No surgeons?

32:31.806 --> 32:33.865
There's 22 surgeries going on up there.

32:34.208 --> 32:38.508
We'll do it here. l'll get Benton.
Prep a thoracotomy tray now!

32:38.714 --> 32:40.079
Oh, Morris.

32:42.284 --> 32:45.276
l need a surgeon. l've got
a AAA that's about to blow.

32:45.487 --> 32:47.352
Order a laparotomy setup from O.R.

32:47.556 --> 32:49.855
Call Anesthesia, get Dr. Ashe.

32:50.025 --> 32:52.687
-You ever cross-clamped an aorta?
-No.

32:53.062 --> 32:54.460
l don't feel a thing.

32:54.629 --> 32:58.031
Call a code. Get some epi!
Open the lVs wide.

32:58.234 --> 32:59.895
Here's an amp of epi.

33:00.436 --> 33:01.664
Morris.

33:01.938 --> 33:03.963
Doctor, please. Do something.

33:06.776 --> 33:08.209
Where's Dr. Lewis?

33:08.411 --> 33:09.810
Get a pulse and a CPR.

33:10.014 --> 33:11.605
Ready on scope.

33:19.857 --> 33:20.846
Bob!

33:21.191 --> 33:22.658
What are you doing?

33:39.911 --> 33:41.436
Oh, man.

34:05.605 --> 34:07.835
Pulse is faint but l feel it.

34:10.643 --> 34:13.580
Set up that dopamine and run it.

34:20.088 --> 34:21.315
What happened?

34:21.688 --> 34:22.849
lt was Bob.

34:23.491 --> 34:25.822
-Bob?
-Bob.

34:56.692 --> 34:59.321
The police said that
our baby, Ashley....

35:03.199 --> 35:04.530
Oh, my God!

35:04.869 --> 35:06.131
Ashley!

35:07.371 --> 35:09.134
Oh, God!

35:11.808 --> 35:14.642
l love you. Are you okay?

35:16.514 --> 35:17.982
They found the leg.

35:18.182 --> 35:22.585
-Vitals?
-BP's 1 1 0 over 70, pulse is 1 1 2.

35:22.786 --> 35:26.052
-Pulse ox is good, 95 percent.
-What's he had?

35:26.258 --> 35:30.592
8 units packed cells, 4 liters Ringer's.
We're in a holding pattern for Vascular.

35:30.795 --> 35:33.491
Why don't we fly this puppy ourselves?

35:33.698 --> 35:38.227
Send to O.R. for a vascular tray,
Bovie, drapes, gowns and an Ex-Fix.

35:38.437 --> 35:40.667
You're gonna do
a reimplantation in the ER?

35:40.872 --> 35:42.397
Not me. We.

35:42.608 --> 35:46.169
Let's start. The vascular team will
swoop down when they smell the glory.

35:46.379 --> 35:48.813
All right, now you're talking.
Let's go.

35:49.348 --> 35:52.078
Here's the abdominal,
chest and C-spine film.

35:52.286 --> 35:54.652
His BP came up with four units.

35:55.656 --> 35:59.888
Strong piece of work. l've seen
chief surgical residents do worse.

36:00.092 --> 36:01.526
Thanks. Have you seen Bob?

36:01.728 --> 36:05.494
Officer, you want to escort this
camera crew out of here? Right now.

36:05.699 --> 36:07.098
Yo, Dr. Lewis!

36:07.302 --> 36:09.361
They need you to scrub in Trauma 1 .

36:10.505 --> 36:13.132
-Do you know where Cvetic is?
-No.

36:13.341 --> 36:14.865
Dr. Lewis, stat.

36:16.477 --> 36:18.672
Do you know what we call motorcycles?

36:18.880 --> 36:20.006
No. What?

36:20.215 --> 36:21.944
Donorcycles.

36:22.617 --> 36:24.745
-Donorcycles. l like that.
-You would.

36:24.953 --> 36:28.856
You gotta hurry it up, Carter.
You got a million things to do.

36:34.663 --> 36:38.292
-What are you doing?
-l'm trying to get this cast off.

36:38.500 --> 36:40.833
How the hell do you
change your pants, man?

36:41.036 --> 36:45.133
They put it on me as a joke.
And now it's starting to itch!

36:46.542 --> 36:50.104
Tell me about it!
Eight casts in six months.

36:50.313 --> 36:52.008
Hog sat on me.

36:52.215 --> 36:53.842
Dropped my Nighthawk.

36:59.155 --> 37:02.319
Relax, doc.
This won't hurt a bit.

37:09.166 --> 37:10.428
That's Mrs. Ramos.

37:11.469 --> 37:12.994
You want me to come with you?

37:14.106 --> 37:15.572
No, thanks.

37:20.412 --> 37:21.708
Mrs. Ramos.

37:25.083 --> 37:26.607
l'm Dr. Ross.

37:28.620 --> 37:32.886
Your husband sustained very
serious injuries in the accident.

37:36.895 --> 37:38.625
He was brought here...

37:40.199 --> 37:43.362
...and despite our best efforts,
we were unable to save him.

37:51.145 --> 37:52.510
He died.

37:58.719 --> 38:00.050
l'm sorry.

38:08.095 --> 38:09.324
Good night.

38:11.666 --> 38:12.690
Bob?

38:21.176 --> 38:24.236
Now l will never be a doctor here.

38:30.986 --> 38:32.783
Were you planning on being one?

38:34.790 --> 38:37.658
ln my country, l was a surgeon.

38:38.795 --> 38:40.193
Vas--

38:40.429 --> 38:41.590
Vascular?

38:43.200 --> 38:45.134
You're a vascular surgeon?

38:45.836 --> 38:46.825
Yes.

38:49.607 --> 38:51.335
l have to board.

38:54.444 --> 38:55.969
Board.

38:56.380 --> 38:58.941
You have to take the board exam.

38:59.150 --> 39:00.242
Yes.

39:03.154 --> 39:05.122
lf l not operate, the man die.

39:06.257 --> 39:08.521
But now, when they find out...

39:09.427 --> 39:10.689
...l will never board.

39:12.397 --> 39:14.798
Wait a minute.
You operated on somebody?

39:15.434 --> 39:18.096
When they find out what l did....

39:23.275 --> 39:24.367
Did the patient die?

39:29.249 --> 39:30.875
Then they'll be grateful.

39:35.455 --> 39:36.444
Really?

39:36.723 --> 39:39.385
l'll help you with your English
for the board exam.

39:45.599 --> 39:48.432
You would do it for me? That?

40:05.854 --> 40:07.048
He's cyanotic as hell.

40:07.255 --> 40:08.415
Castro.

40:11.159 --> 40:13.059
How'd it go with Mrs. Ramos?

40:13.262 --> 40:14.559
Pulse ox is really bad.

40:14.763 --> 40:16.196
-Hemostat?
-Sixty.

40:16.399 --> 40:18.025
Check his cardiovascular.

40:20.436 --> 40:21.460
What is that?

40:21.804 --> 40:23.101
Patrick again.

40:23.539 --> 40:27.100
-His pulse is down to 30.
-0.5 of atropine.

40:27.511 --> 40:31.207
Guy on the phone, Mr. Blinker.
He'll only talk to you, Dr. Greene.

40:31.415 --> 40:33.245
Put him on the speaker.

40:33.584 --> 40:34.608
<i>Dr. Greene?</i>

40:34.818 --> 40:35.842
l'm here.

40:36.219 --> 40:37.345
<i>She wants to push.</i>

40:37.988 --> 40:41.048
Look between her legs
and tell me what you see.

40:41.658 --> 40:43.125
Retract here.

40:43.327 --> 40:44.590
<i>Baby hair.</i>

40:44.795 --> 40:47.731
<i>-You ever delivered a baby?
-I'm a plumber!</i>

40:47.932 --> 40:49.627
<i>-It's coming!
-Good stuff to good stuff.</i>

40:49.834 --> 40:52.166
We want to control the head.

40:52.369 --> 40:56.569
When the head is halfway out,
tell your wife not to push...

40:56.774 --> 40:59.208
...and then gently ease
the skin over it.

40:59.410 --> 41:02.847
<i>-What, the head?
-Yeah, like putting on a sweater.</i>

41:03.047 --> 41:05.311
<i>Well, the head's out.
It's turning!</i>

41:05.517 --> 41:06.712
Retract here.

41:06.919 --> 41:09.149
That's what it's supposed to do.

41:09.355 --> 41:12.119
Now gently pull down
towards the floor.

41:15.227 --> 41:16.489
<i>Hey, it's a boy!</i>

41:16.695 --> 41:18.390
Good. Good work.

41:18.597 --> 41:23.126
Now place the baby on your wife's belly,
get a shoelace and tie the cord.

41:23.336 --> 41:26.328
Wrap them up in a blanket,
nice and warm, and bring them in.

41:28.909 --> 41:32.276
Dr. Benton, your friend
has his tibial artery back.

41:35.315 --> 41:36.714
The vascular team's here.

41:37.385 --> 41:41.685
We've débrided, re-anastomosed posterior
tibial artery and saphenous vein.

41:41.888 --> 41:42.877
Confirmed flow.

41:43.090 --> 41:45.217
Strong preliminary work.
Get him unhooked.

41:45.626 --> 41:49.255
All right, Dex. l'll see you
walking down King Drive.

41:52.100 --> 41:53.362
l'll finish the chart.

42:02.878 --> 42:05.073
-Are you okay?
-About what?

42:05.281 --> 42:06.975
About Mr. Ramos.

42:07.983 --> 42:09.212
Everything.

42:11.019 --> 42:12.987
Yes. l'm glad you're happy.

42:13.189 --> 42:14.247
Really.

42:15.157 --> 42:19.185
-l'll get my stuff and we can go.
-You got it, sweetie.

42:28.772 --> 42:29.966
You know...

42:30.774 --> 42:33.402
...Doug is a fabulous guy.

42:33.911 --> 42:36.539
We have lots of fun and he's cute.

42:36.747 --> 42:38.647
He's great in bed.

42:41.519 --> 42:43.885
Do you think there's
one perfect love?

42:44.221 --> 42:45.849
<i>Like Sleepless In Seattle...</i>

42:46.057 --> 42:50.994
...somewhere under the stars,
one perfect person for everybody?

42:53.932 --> 42:56.093
l don't know. Why?

42:56.602 --> 42:58.364
Because for Doug...

42:58.571 --> 42:59.936
...it's you.

43:00.138 --> 43:02.835
Hey, who ordered these pizzas?

43:04.143 --> 43:07.544
-Pizza's here!
-All right!

43:09.815 --> 43:11.841
Great job, folks.

43:12.051 --> 43:14.212
Excellent. Very nice.

43:16.389 --> 43:18.858
Hey, it's Dr. Bob!

43:24.965 --> 43:26.455
Now what?

43:28.168 --> 43:29.796
All right, Patrick!

44:51.491 --> 44:53.789
Mr. Blinker? Mrs. Blinker?

44:54.527 --> 44:55.994
Dr. Greene?

45:01.000 --> 45:03.298
God bless you, Dr. Greene.
