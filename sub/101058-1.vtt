WEBVTT

00:16.441 --> 00:19.444
Get one that's funny
but not too funny.

00:19.478 --> 00:21.513
This doesn't seem to be
a joking matter.

00:26.586 --> 00:27.820
They look like you.

00:29.087 --> 00:32.223
I don't think getting my girl
a card with another family on it

00:32.256 --> 00:33.793
is the right way
to go on this one, kid.

00:37.195 --> 00:38.230
What about this one?

00:39.164 --> 00:42.669
No. Cats.
Definitely, yeah, cats.

00:42.702 --> 00:45.672
Right, 'cause I'm a dog,
a bad dog.

00:50.409 --> 00:51.376
This one?

00:52.444 --> 00:53.478
What's it say on the inside?

00:54.581 --> 00:55.682
It says cool cats

00:55.715 --> 00:58.517
and then there's some cats
playing musical instruments.

01:00.285 --> 01:02.689
- That's stupid.
- I don't get it.

01:02.722 --> 01:05.223
It's like cool cats, right?

01:05.658 --> 01:07.292
It's a play on the word cats

01:07.326 --> 01:09.796
because they're playing jazz
and back in the day

01:09.829 --> 01:12.464
guys would refer to friends
or cool people as cats.

01:12.497 --> 01:14.232
So, like cool cats.

01:15.902 --> 01:17.837
Oh, yeah. Kind of like nigger.

01:17.870 --> 01:21.608
No, wait, no. Why would you?
No. No. No. Okay?

01:21.641 --> 01:24.376
- No. Don't say that word.
- Why not?

01:24.409 --> 01:26.846
Because it's a bad word
for reasons you don't know yet

01:26.879 --> 01:28.748
and if you say it again,
I'll hit you.

01:28.781 --> 01:29.882
No, you won't.

01:31.316 --> 01:32.619
Yes, I will.

01:34.419 --> 01:36.455
Ni... Ow!

01:36.488 --> 01:37.522
I told you.

01:37.557 --> 01:38.891
Can't hit me. I'm only nine.

01:38.925 --> 01:39.993
- Does it hurt?
- Yes.

01:40.026 --> 01:43.462
Good. You just learned
a very valuable life lesson.

01:43.495 --> 01:45.197
Yeah, cause and effect.

01:45.665 --> 01:46.933
Every action has a reaction

01:46.966 --> 01:49.234
that you may or may not
be able to control.

01:49.267 --> 01:51.436
You touch a hot stove,
you might burn your hand.

01:51.470 --> 01:52.639
You run across the street
without looking,

01:52.672 --> 01:54.272
you might get hit by a car.

01:54.306 --> 01:56.241
You say the N word
around black people

01:56.274 --> 01:57.342
you might get thumped
in the ear,

01:57.376 --> 01:59.646
punched in the kidney, right?
But now you know,

01:59.679 --> 02:03.215
you got to think about what
you do or say before you do it.

02:03.248 --> 02:04.249
Makes sense?

02:05.217 --> 02:06.719
Kind of.

02:06.753 --> 02:09.321
Hey, listen. Hey, I'm sorry.

02:09.354 --> 02:13.358
I shouldn't have done that.
Let me see. Let me see.

02:14.326 --> 02:17.295
Ow! What did you do that for?

02:17.329 --> 02:19.364
'Cause it looks like you still
kind of want to say it

02:19.398 --> 02:20.198
and I want you to know
what happens

02:20.232 --> 02:22.334
if you even think
about saying it.

02:22.367 --> 02:23.936
You'll thank me later in life,
I promise.

02:23.970 --> 02:26.338
Okay, I won't say.
I won't think about saying it.

02:26.371 --> 02:27.774
Geez! I'm sorry.

02:28.675 --> 02:30.977
Hey, look, man. I'm sorry, okay?
Let me see.

02:31.010 --> 02:34.614
- No, no, not this time.
- There you go, boom.

02:36.448 --> 02:37.884
You know, fuck it.

02:37.917 --> 02:39.552
I'll just get this one.

02:39.585 --> 02:41.721
- You want anything?
- No, thanks.

02:41.754 --> 02:43.623
Here. Put that on your ear.

04:00.633 --> 04:01.834
Uh, hey.

04:01.868 --> 04:03.836
Oh, hey. Uh,

04:03.870 --> 04:06.371
tell Katie to call me
when she gets up, yeah?

04:06.404 --> 04:07.840
- I have to go to work.
- I'm up.

04:11.778 --> 04:13.980
Thanks for letting us
come over so late.

04:14.013 --> 04:15.948
You are the best.

04:33.866 --> 04:35.668
And how does that make you feel?

04:36.869 --> 04:38.303
I hate when you ask me that.

04:39.639 --> 04:42.608
This is therapy, Gabe.
It's kind of part of my job.

04:42.642 --> 04:46.946
I don't know, fine, great,
terrible, empty. I don't know.

04:47.914 --> 04:48.881
I'm single though, right?

04:48.915 --> 04:50.448
I should be able to do
whatever I want to do.

04:50.482 --> 04:52.450
I should feel great.
You told me that.

04:53.085 --> 04:55.688
I think I told you that
you need to learn to let go

04:55.721 --> 04:59.025
and be present and enjoy
the moment sometimes, yes, but...

04:59.058 --> 05:01.694
You know, the threesome,
it wasn't even my idea.

05:01.727 --> 05:02.762
It was theirs and yours.

05:02.795 --> 05:03.996
It was not my idea.

05:04.030 --> 05:07.066
Being single is just as stupid
as being in a relationship.

05:08.167 --> 05:11.070
Like they rode away
on a scooter, Doc.

05:11.103 --> 05:13.005
Like a regular ass scooter.

05:14.941 --> 05:16.609
Why did you and Millie break up?

05:20.680 --> 05:22.514
We're just taking a small break
right now.

05:23.149 --> 05:25.585
Define that, a break.

05:27.820 --> 05:30.590
We just, uh, we just...

05:30.623 --> 05:32.091
We just got to figure
some things out.

05:32.892 --> 05:34.861
Okay, can you expand
on that a little bit more?

05:42.768 --> 05:44.402
Gabe, what makes you happy?

05:45.838 --> 05:50.375
You know anything about dreams,
animal dreams to be exact?

05:52.078 --> 05:54.512
A little, yeah. Why?

05:54.547 --> 05:56.414
So, I had this dream
the other day

05:57.550 --> 05:59.785
and I'm riding my bike
up this trail, right?

05:59.819 --> 06:01.020
And it's starting to get dark

06:01.053 --> 06:03.055
and I remember I got to get
to the top before the sun sets

06:03.089 --> 06:05.024
because pretty soon
it's going to get too dark

06:05.057 --> 06:06.158
to see in a little bit.

06:06.192 --> 06:10.462
And, now, it's time to coast
back down, slowly at first

06:10.495 --> 06:12.565
and then, all of a sudden,
I started picking up speed.

06:13.032 --> 06:15.500
And there's potholes and cracks
and shit everywhere.

06:15.534 --> 06:17.803
And on top of that, right,
my brakes stop working.

06:17.837 --> 06:20.773
So now, here I am,
flying down this uneven path

06:20.806 --> 06:22.041
with people all in the way

06:22.074 --> 06:26.679
and I realize I either got to
just jump off this motherfucker

06:26.712 --> 06:28.614
or I got to ride out
and just see what happens.

06:30.482 --> 06:31.416
And I decide to jump.

06:31.449 --> 06:34.620
And then, right before I jump,
I look over

06:34.654 --> 06:36.956
and it's an elephant
running full speed

06:36.989 --> 06:40.026
with a skunk on his back
staring right at me.

06:40.059 --> 06:42.161
Then he puts his trunk out,
trips my bike,

06:42.194 --> 06:43.162
I go flying in the air,

06:43.195 --> 06:45.898
about to land on a pile of rocks
and probably die

06:45.932 --> 06:48.000
and then I wake up.
What's that all mean, Doc?

06:49.568 --> 06:52.638
- Do you have these dreams often?
- No.

06:52.672 --> 06:56.242
Animals in your dream,
all have various meanings and symbolism,

06:56.275 --> 06:58.044
but let me think on that
a little bit.

06:58.077 --> 06:59.477
I'll get back to you next week.

06:59.511 --> 07:00.179
Okay.

07:01.948 --> 07:04.482
All right, time's up.
What's my homework?

07:04.516 --> 07:06.185
Your homework
is to really spend some time

07:06.218 --> 07:09.221
and find the answer
to what I asked you.

07:09.255 --> 07:10.156
Which is what?

07:11.223 --> 07:12.858
What makes Gabe happy?

07:12.892 --> 07:14.994
- I don't know.
- I know.

07:15.027 --> 07:17.163
That's why it's your homework.

07:18.064 --> 07:20.166
- See you next Wednesday?
- See you next Wednesday.

07:24.136 --> 07:25.805
Nice kicks.

07:36.048 --> 07:38.584
Hey, hon. Hi.

07:39.618 --> 07:41.153
- How was your session?
- Fine.

07:44.690 --> 07:45.725
Good.

07:47.326 --> 07:49.695
Good. Glad to hear that.

07:50.196 --> 07:52.631
Well, I hope you're hungry
because Wednesday's...

07:52.665 --> 07:55.134
Humpty hamburger day. I know.

07:55.167 --> 07:56.135
Well...

07:58.037 --> 08:00.940
Hey, there champ!
How's your session, huh?

08:02.208 --> 08:04.610
- Fine.
- Fine, yeah.

08:04.643 --> 08:06.846
It was.
That's what I like to hear, huh.

08:06.879 --> 08:09.148
I'm going to go to my room
and work on my homework

08:09.181 --> 08:10.950
until dinner is ready.
Is that okay?

08:10.983 --> 08:12.885
Yeah, you don't need to ask
permission to do your homework.

08:12.918 --> 08:15.154
Just do me a favor
and keep the door open.

08:20.993 --> 08:22.595
- It smells good in here.
- Hmm.

08:22.628 --> 08:23.729
We have any hamburgers.

08:32.905 --> 08:35.207
That's a really
good job, Alec. Keep it up.

08:40.913 --> 08:42.014
That's really good.

08:46.619 --> 08:49.055
Okay, everybody, tomorrow we're
going to talk about

08:49.088 --> 08:51.957
how all the slaves were freed
by Harriet Tubman.

08:52.792 --> 08:56.228
Have a good lunch. Bye.

09:04.937 --> 09:05.938
Hey, dick-breath.

09:07.139 --> 09:08.641
Leave me alone, Jason.

09:08.674 --> 09:11.143
I'll do whatever I want
dick-breath, my dad's a cop.

09:11.877 --> 09:14.146
- My name's Alec.
- It used to be.

09:14.180 --> 09:16.382
Then I changed it
to dick-breath

09:16.415 --> 09:19.952
and now,
now, it's shithead.

09:19.985 --> 09:21.887
I'm pretty sure it's still Alec.

09:21.921 --> 09:24.690
Nope, definitely shithead.

09:24.723 --> 09:25.724
Ow!

09:27.760 --> 09:28.761
Get it.

09:33.032 --> 09:34.233
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

09:34.266 --> 09:36.268
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19...

09:44.043 --> 09:45.845
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's good. That's good.

09:45.878 --> 09:48.247
That's what I'm talking about.
Right, well done, everybody.

09:48.280 --> 09:50.416
You know what the time
is not for you. That's okay.

09:50.449 --> 09:53.018
Yes, good job.
You're almost there. Let's go.

09:53.052 --> 09:55.654
Ah, here we go. Get 'em.
Let's go.

09:55.688 --> 09:58.190
Yeah, big dog. Bang it out.
Come on. We're almost done.

09:58.224 --> 09:59.191
Okay. Eight...

09:59.225 --> 10:02.328
Five, four, three, huh,
who wants to be sexy...

10:02.361 --> 10:04.964
Two, one. That's time.
There we go.

10:04.997 --> 10:06.732
Everybody get some water,
real quick, real quick.

10:06.765 --> 10:09.835
Let's go. Good job.
Good job. Good job. Well done.

10:15.374 --> 10:17.943
You know I started following her
on Instagram.

10:17.977 --> 10:19.712
She posted a throwback Thursday

10:19.745 --> 10:22.414
and she's had that butt
since she was a teenager.

10:23.949 --> 10:27.319
Just a perfect butt
like Kim and Chloe.

10:28.420 --> 10:29.922
It's not fucking fair.

10:31.390 --> 10:32.224
I don't...

10:32.258 --> 10:34.260
I don't think their butts
are real.

10:35.494 --> 10:36.428
Whatever.

10:36.462 --> 10:38.697
What do you even know
about butts anyway?

10:43.035 --> 10:44.236
Ouch!

10:44.270 --> 10:45.337
Why, what's wrong?

10:45.371 --> 10:49.742
Oh, it's just my hamstrings
are really tight today.

10:51.343 --> 10:52.745
Do you want to stretch it out
for me?

10:52.778 --> 10:53.913
Uh, yeah. Sure.

10:53.946 --> 10:55.748
You know, you don't want to
play around with hammies.

10:55.781 --> 10:57.283
Right. Thank you.

10:57.316 --> 11:00.753
It's just you are so good
at this.

11:01.387 --> 11:04.690
Yeah, do you, um,
do you do home sessions?

11:08.794 --> 11:10.429
All right, I think you're good.

11:10.462 --> 11:11.964
Women are full of shit,
Doc.

11:12.865 --> 11:15.134
I know we're not allowed
to say it now, but it's true.

11:15.167 --> 11:16.936
Talking about,
"My hamstring's hurt."

11:16.969 --> 11:19.338
I knew there wasn't nothing
wrong with her damn hamstrings.

11:19.371 --> 11:20.472
You want to have a seat, Gabe?

11:20.506 --> 11:24.076
Like, like nobody's happy
in a relationship. Nobody.

11:24.109 --> 11:27.513
Why, why is she getting married
if she's out doing that, huh?

11:27.547 --> 11:29.415
I'll tell you why
'cause nobody's happy.

11:29.448 --> 11:30.883
She's not happy.

11:30.916 --> 11:34.987
She's only getting married 'cause
that's what society tells you got to do.

11:35.020 --> 11:38.290
You go out, you marry somebody
you barely tolerate,

11:38.324 --> 11:41.160
you have some badass kids
to overcompensate,

11:41.193 --> 11:44.463
then they grow up move out
the house, they stop calling you

11:44.496 --> 11:46.165
and now you're stuck
with this person

11:46.198 --> 11:48.500
who you didn't even like
for the rest of your dying days.

11:48.535 --> 11:50.069
Oh, wait!
Unless you want to get a divorce

11:50.102 --> 11:51.937
and then they just
take half your shit.

11:51.971 --> 11:54.773
Oh, and even better, now you get
to watch the kids grow up

11:54.807 --> 11:57.276
and make the same
stupid-ass mistakes you did.

11:57.309 --> 11:58.978
And then you've just,
you just got to lie to them

11:59.011 --> 12:00.980
and say stuff like,
"It'll get better."

12:01.013 --> 12:02.549
Really, what you should say is,

12:02.582 --> 12:05.150
"I never should have
gotten married, or had your ass,

12:05.184 --> 12:07.486
or stayed at my job
as long as I did.

12:07.519 --> 12:09.922
And now, I'm fat and old
and nobody cares

12:09.955 --> 12:12.124
and just fucking
everybody's stupid."

12:19.331 --> 12:22.067
Are there any solid
examples of love in your life?

12:22.101 --> 12:25.971
Yeah, yeah.
I love Twix ice cream bars.

12:26.005 --> 12:27.906
And I'm being serious, Gabe.

12:31.877 --> 12:35.447
Okay, my parents have been
married for 35 years

12:35.481 --> 12:39.351
and love each other so much,
they sleep in separate bedrooms.

12:40.587 --> 12:42.421
I've never even seen
my parents kiss.

12:44.290 --> 12:45.991
You know what my mom did
last week

12:46.025 --> 12:47.527
to show my pops
how much she loved him?

12:48.227 --> 12:50.429
She purposely didn't pay
the cable bill

12:51.130 --> 12:53.332
just so he missed game five
of the finals.

12:53.999 --> 12:56.802
How's that for a solid
example of love?

12:57.303 --> 12:59.371
Do you think you and Millie will
end up this way,

12:59.405 --> 13:00.540
just like your parents?

13:01.675 --> 13:05.010
'm just saying
like "Love ain't enough, Doc."

13:05.044 --> 13:07.212
And whatever love they had
is long gone.

13:08.047 --> 13:10.316
My mom should have left my
father years ago and she didn't,

13:10.349 --> 13:11.917
so now she resents him.

13:11.950 --> 13:14.253
And my dad,
he's guilty about some shit

13:14.286 --> 13:15.321
that happened a long time ago,

13:15.354 --> 13:17.990
so whatever nonsense
my mother puts him through,

13:18.023 --> 13:19.892
he just thinks he deserves it.

13:19.925 --> 13:21.160
So, he won't leave either.

13:21.193 --> 13:23.596
Like I said, everybody's stupid.

13:24.496 --> 13:28.300
Is it possible that that's a
reason why you revealed to me

13:28.334 --> 13:31.970
that you tend to
drive relationships away?

13:32.004 --> 13:37.843
I'm saying like what if Millie
is really happy with me

13:39.011 --> 13:42.214
and I'm really happy with her
and everything is great

13:43.449 --> 13:46.018
and she still goes out and
fuck's a trainer from LA Fitness

13:46.051 --> 13:47.319
and let's my cable get cut off?

13:48.220 --> 13:50.389
There are plenty of
happy relationships out there.

13:50.422 --> 13:51.558
You've got to water the garden.

13:51.591 --> 13:52.692
There...

13:52.726 --> 13:55.961
It can be fun if you're doing it
with the right person.

13:55.994 --> 13:58.130
It just takes work.

13:58.163 --> 13:59.298
What? No!

13:59.331 --> 14:01.367
I hate when people say
that shit.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.869
Relationships take work.
No, they don't.

14:04.336 --> 14:05.437
You know what takes work?

14:05.471 --> 14:06.972
Work, right?

14:07.005 --> 14:09.007
I don't wanna go to work
and come home

14:09.041 --> 14:10.909
and work on some more shit.
No, no, no.

14:10.943 --> 14:13.245
I want my relationship
to be anti-work.

14:13.278 --> 14:15.214
Fuck work and fuck gardens.

14:20.452 --> 14:23.656
Gabe, you know, I, um...

14:27.694 --> 14:30.462
did a little more research
on your dream.

14:31.598 --> 14:32.998
Elephants, right?

14:34.967 --> 14:37.002
"Elephants represent
a part of you

14:37.035 --> 14:39.138
that may be having a tough time

14:39.171 --> 14:41.273
letting something go
from the past,

14:42.174 --> 14:44.644
or that you need to be
more patient

14:44.677 --> 14:46.412
with something or someone.

14:47.079 --> 14:49.281
Its trunk is also
a phallic symbol

14:49.314 --> 14:51.517
for sexual needs and desires

14:51.551 --> 14:54.453
yours,
or perhaps someone else's."

14:55.688 --> 14:58.725
Conversely, the elephant's
introverted personality

14:58.758 --> 15:01.193
may be a reflection
of your own personality.

15:01.226 --> 15:04.163
Okay, so what about the
weird-ass skunk on his back?

15:04.196 --> 15:06.298
A skunk is an
interesting animal actually.

15:06.999 --> 15:09.501
A skunk's natural defense
is to repel

15:09.536 --> 15:11.136
without causing deadly harm.

15:12.304 --> 15:17.376
So, the skunk could represent
you driving people away

15:17.409 --> 15:19.278
or turning them off.

15:20.547 --> 15:23.449
Okay. So why was the elephant
running so fast down the hill?

15:23.482 --> 15:24.483
I don't know, Gabe.

15:27.419 --> 15:29.656
Maybe things are moving
a little too quickly for you.

15:33.626 --> 15:36.962
Maybe things are
getting out of control

15:37.697 --> 15:40.633
and you don't like not being
in control, so what do you do?

15:41.801 --> 15:45.572
You self-sabotage so no one else
can do it for you.

15:46.706 --> 15:47.973
You repel.

15:48.440 --> 15:50.509
It's a form of control
in and of itself.

15:51.477 --> 15:54.581
It's like the student
who doesn't study for an exam

15:54.614 --> 15:57.617
and then he gets an F
and then he convinces himself

15:57.650 --> 15:59.752
that it's only because
he didn't study

15:59.786 --> 16:01.453
that he received
a failing grade,

16:02.589 --> 16:04.523
not because
he didn't know the material.

16:06.058 --> 16:09.662
Failure to try
because of fear of failure

16:10.797 --> 16:12.599
is worse than
trying and failing.

16:14.299 --> 16:15.535
Whatever fears you have,

16:15.568 --> 16:18.671
whatever thoughts
you're holding on to,

16:20.740 --> 16:22.742
you have to find a way
to let them go.

16:27.580 --> 16:29.515
Okay.

16:31.416 --> 16:32.585
- Hi.
- Hey.

16:37.590 --> 16:39.458
Damn, little man.
What happened to your kicks?

16:42.361 --> 16:44.296
I don't know. I guess
I must have got them dirty

16:44.329 --> 16:45.364
playing with my friends.

16:45.397 --> 16:46.164
Huh.

16:46.198 --> 16:47.734
Soap, water,
a little toothpaste,

16:47.767 --> 16:49.536
- it'll get it right out.
- Really?

16:49.569 --> 16:50.603
Yeah.

16:51.771 --> 16:52.437
Huh.

16:53.573 --> 16:55.642
- Good to know.
- Yeah.

17:00.445 --> 17:02.281
<i>They meet
in the center of the ring</i>

17:02.314 --> 17:04.584
<i>and here we go.</i>

17:04.617 --> 17:08.655
<i>Alvarez, Walker.
I think this fight is gonna...</i>

17:08.688 --> 17:10.589
<i>It's gonna be done
in the early round.</i>

17:10.623 --> 17:13.560
<i>I think Alvarez is going to
take Walker in the early round.</i>

17:13.593 --> 17:15.227
<i>I know it's a five-round fight,</i>

17:15.260 --> 17:18.195
<i>but I'm saying this round one
is going to be his round.</i>

17:18.230 --> 17:19.632
<i>It's classic Alvarez.</i>

17:19.665 --> 17:21.634
<i>And then round two
is going to be a...</i>

17:21.667 --> 17:23.770
<i>I fought Walker, I'm telling you</i>

17:23.803 --> 17:26.705
<i>he's going to drag this thing
to five.</i>

17:26.739 --> 17:28.507
<i>He's going to drag it to five.</i>

17:28.540 --> 17:30.442
<i>He's got power in his hands</i>

17:30.475 --> 17:32.277
<i>and he's going to
knock this boy out.</i>

17:32.311 --> 17:33.846
<i>You may just be right.</i>

17:33.880 --> 17:37.617
<i>Your fight with Alvarez is what
Walker was watching all camp.</i>

17:37.650 --> 17:39.752
<i>You have the best shot
with Alvarez.</i>

17:39.786 --> 17:42.589
<i>I know Walker was looking
at your fight</i>

17:42.622 --> 17:44.891
<i>and thinking
the exact same thing.</i>

17:44.924 --> 17:49.261
<i>But I believe Alvarez, he is a
Brazilian Ju-Jitsu black belt.</i>

17:49.294 --> 17:53.666
<i>He is good at his job and there
is no one more comfortable</i>

17:53.700 --> 17:56.401
<i>in the middle of an octagon
than Alvarez.</i>

17:56.435 --> 17:58.805
<i>Walker is going to
be right there in the middle,</i>

17:58.838 --> 18:00.405
<i>every single time.</i>

18:00.439 --> 18:03.743
<i>He's gonna be able to take
all of Alvarez's shots.</i>

18:03.776 --> 18:05.510
<i>I'm telling you
this is going to go five.</i>

18:05.545 --> 18:07.446
<i>And there's a
really great kick by Walker</i>

18:07.479 --> 18:09.882
<i>and Alvarez is hurt.
Alvarez is hurt.</i>

18:09.916 --> 18:11.149
<i>He is visibly hurt.</i>

18:11.183 --> 18:13.385
<i>He's got him
on the cage. He's got him...</i>

18:13.418 --> 18:15.420
<i>And this is where Walker
is really damaged 'cause...</i>

18:15.454 --> 18:17.724
<i>And you can see
Alvarez really trying</i>

18:17.757 --> 18:19.524
<i>to compensate for that pain.</i>

18:19.559 --> 18:20.459
<i>He feels the...</i>

18:27.667 --> 18:29.401
Man, I don't know what
you had me doing last time,

18:29.434 --> 18:30.469
but I'm still sore.

18:30.937 --> 18:32.772
I could barely lift my guitar.

18:32.805 --> 18:34.272
- Work?
- Yeah.

18:34.907 --> 18:38.210
What was it?
The super spi... Super spina?

18:38.243 --> 18:39.112
Supraspinatus.

18:39.177 --> 18:41.848
- Super spi... Spina...
- Supraspinatus.

18:41.881 --> 18:43.482
Supraspinatus.

18:43.515 --> 18:44.651
Uh, it's great.

18:46.953 --> 18:48.755
So, how's your business going?
It's good?

18:49.722 --> 18:51.591
Uh, yeah. Yeah, it's good.

18:51.624 --> 18:53.225
Just trying to get some
new clients

18:53.258 --> 18:55.394
and, you know, get the word out,
but, yeah, it's good.

18:55.427 --> 18:56.863
That's great.
Well, just let me know

18:56.896 --> 18:58.698
if there's anything else
you need me to do,

18:58.731 --> 18:59.799
more money or anything.

19:00.465 --> 19:01.400
I got you.

19:01.433 --> 19:03.502
Oh, no, no.
You've done more than enough.

19:03.536 --> 19:07.239
Yeah, well, anything
for a friend of Millie's.

19:08.306 --> 19:11.376
How is she doing by the way?
She's still taking pictures?

19:11.978 --> 19:13.512
She's got such a great eye.

19:13.546 --> 19:15.247
Yeah, no.
She's, uh, she's great.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.684
She's started taking
a new photography class.

19:17.717 --> 19:19.384
Pictures are getting
better and better.

19:19.418 --> 19:20.452
- Oh, good.
- Yeah, now she's great.

19:20.485 --> 19:24.590
So, I just bought
this green earth energy company

19:24.624 --> 19:26.759
that helps turn old straws
and bottle caps

19:26.793 --> 19:27.927
into cars and houses.

19:27.960 --> 19:31.597
We're gonna launch it in
Portugal before our next tour.

19:32.765 --> 19:34.499
I was thinking about
asking Millie to be

19:34.534 --> 19:36.736
the artistic director
for the campaign.

19:37.537 --> 19:40.573
- You think she'd be into that?
- Wow, to...

19:41.708 --> 19:42.809
- Wow, in Portugal.
- Yeah.

19:42.842 --> 19:43.609
- To go with you?
- Yeah.

19:43.643 --> 19:45.310
Well, she took all
these pictures.

19:45.343 --> 19:46.713
I took a year off

19:46.746 --> 19:49.749
and she and I went backpacking
around the world,

19:49.782 --> 19:53.285
all we had was what was
in our packs, in our pockets.

19:54.419 --> 19:55.487
Here, check this out.

19:56.956 --> 19:59.257
- Shot this in Bali.
- Hmm.

19:59.291 --> 20:00.660
Have you been to Bali?

20:00.693 --> 20:01.928
- Uh, no.
- It's amazing.

20:02.795 --> 20:04.731
And then, um,
well, she caught this one

20:04.764 --> 20:06.599
when we were on a sailboat
in Jakarta.

20:07.399 --> 20:08.701
Have you ever been to Indonesia?

20:08.735 --> 20:09.602
No.

20:10.737 --> 20:13.840
You got to travel, Gabe.
See the world, it's incredible.

20:15.675 --> 20:16.676
Here this one's my favorite.

20:16.709 --> 20:20.780
So, we got caught
in a massive storm in Tahiti

20:20.813 --> 20:22.749
and we weren't able to
leave that tent for two days.

20:24.449 --> 20:26.619
- Millie.
- Okay, here we go.

20:26.652 --> 20:27.687
- Workout time.
- Oh, sorry.

20:27.720 --> 20:29.421
- Yep.
- Um...

20:29.454 --> 20:31.490
- Yep, yep, you got it.
- Oh-ho-ho-ho.

20:32.925 --> 20:36.529
Oh, babe. You are not gonna
believe some of the shots that I got.

20:36.562 --> 20:39.031
I finally decided to get that
new R-Adapter for my Leica,

20:39.065 --> 20:40.967
the one my cousin got me
for my birthday.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.636
It is so dope, especially
when the sun is setting.

20:44.336 --> 20:46.739
- Cool.
- Oh, and guess what else?

20:47.740 --> 20:51.309
Kai got engaged.
Anthony finally proposed.

20:51.343 --> 20:53.946
He hired this whole
like flash mob to do it,

20:53.980 --> 20:56.048
so when they all started
dancing, he joined in

20:56.082 --> 20:58.084
and then he got down on one knee
and popped the question.

20:58.117 --> 21:00.519
Kai almost fainted,
it was so cute.

21:01.020 --> 21:02.555
I got it on video
if you want to see it.

21:04.724 --> 21:05.591
Okay.

21:06.926 --> 21:07.994
What is it?

21:08.027 --> 21:09.262
Is Marc trying to steal
another one of your clients?

21:09.294 --> 21:12.799
I told you he's gonna keep doing
that if you don't say something.

21:12.832 --> 21:13.800
That's nothing.

21:14.934 --> 21:16.569
Okay, you know
I know you too well for that.

21:17.637 --> 21:19.071
Okay, look, if you wanted
something different,

21:19.105 --> 21:20.573
I could have made
something different.

21:21.808 --> 21:22.742
Nope.

21:23.709 --> 21:24.977
Gabe, what is it?

21:28.114 --> 21:29.916
Why'd you have to introduce me
to him?

21:33.553 --> 21:35.588
No, Gabe. Come on.

21:35.621 --> 21:37.657
- Please.
- I just can't figure it out.

21:38.758 --> 21:39.625
- I cannot figure it out.
- Okay, look,

21:39.659 --> 21:42.061
we have been over this
a thousand times.

21:43.461 --> 21:45.497
He's an old friend that I knew
long before you,

21:45.531 --> 21:46.999
mind you,
and I thought I could help.

21:47.033 --> 21:48.134
You said you were over this.

21:48.167 --> 21:50.036
Yeah, well, clearly,
I'm not over it

21:50.069 --> 21:52.004
'cause this is what not over
it looks like.

21:52.772 --> 21:54.674
I mean, what,
like what were you thinking?

21:54.707 --> 21:57.844
Right, like how could I make
some not awkward shit

21:57.877 --> 21:59.411
as awkward as possible?

21:59.444 --> 22:00.680
Oh, I know, light bulb.

22:00.713 --> 22:02.849
I'll introduce the guy
I'm currently dating

22:02.882 --> 22:06.052
to my rich, successful,
ex-fiancé,

22:06.085 --> 22:06.986
right, who's the rock star.

22:07.019 --> 22:09.155
And then they can do business
together.

22:09.188 --> 22:10.923
Yeah, that's genius.

22:10.957 --> 22:12.058
Gabe will like that.

22:12.091 --> 22:14.560
Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

22:14.594 --> 22:16.829
I spend all of my time trying to
figure out how to piss you off.

22:16.863 --> 22:17.997
Come on.

22:18.030 --> 22:19.765
I did it for you.
You were trying to

22:19.799 --> 22:21.399
get your personal training
business off the ground,

22:21.433 --> 22:22.602
and you needed the money.

22:23.069 --> 22:25.004
- To the a-hole.
- What?

22:25.037 --> 22:26.539
What are you talking about?

22:26.572 --> 22:28.941
He does free concerts
all over the world.

22:28.975 --> 22:30.776
He donates half of his money
to not-for-profits

22:30.810 --> 22:32.712
that go directly to women,
children, and Africa.

22:32.745 --> 22:34.412
Yeah, tax write-off.

22:34.446 --> 22:36.682
White celebrities always do that
shit when they wanna look cool.

22:36.716 --> 22:39.785
Go off, adopt a little African
baby, fuck his hair all up,

22:39.819 --> 22:41.187
take dumb pictures of him.

22:41.220 --> 22:43.689
That shit ain't cool.
Don't make you a good person.

22:44.522 --> 22:45.625
You know this is not fair.

22:46.826 --> 22:49.195
Do I grill you about all the
women you've been with, huh?

22:49.228 --> 22:50.696
I mean, you really want to open
that can of worms

22:50.730 --> 22:52.098
'cause I don't think that
you do.

22:52.131 --> 22:53.599
I'm a little scared to ask

22:53.633 --> 22:54.967
where you've been
or what you've been doing

22:55.001 --> 22:57.069
since we've been on another one
of our little breaks.

22:57.103 --> 22:58.738
Oh, you want to know
the difference, though,

22:58.771 --> 23:00.472
I didn't love any of them

23:00.505 --> 23:01.941
and it's different with you,
too, and you know it.

23:01.974 --> 23:04.143
Okay, Gabe. Gabe, baby.

23:06.679 --> 23:07.914
You, you've got to stop.

23:10.716 --> 23:15.187
I'm not with him. I am...
I'm trying to be with you.

23:15.888 --> 23:17.990
Patrick and I are just friends.
That is it.

23:18.024 --> 23:20.559
No, no. You're not just friends.

23:20.593 --> 23:21.894
That's your ex-fiancé.

23:23.162 --> 23:25.164
He wants to take you on another
trip around the world somewhere.

23:25.197 --> 23:27.633
You, him, and the camera,
taking pictures of him,

23:27.667 --> 23:29.702
fucking serenading a dolphin.

23:29.735 --> 23:31.537
Just tell me this though, right,

23:31.570 --> 23:34.573
have we ever had sex
to one of his stupid-ass songs?

23:34.607 --> 23:36.474
- Huh, we probably have...
- Oh, fuck you, Gabe!

23:36.508 --> 23:37.276
Yeah, it's fucked up.

23:38.144 --> 23:39.612
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

23:39.645 --> 23:42.248
I mean you got me on this
twisted ass yo-yo,

23:42.281 --> 23:44.150
breaking up with me
because you say you need space

23:44.183 --> 23:46.986
and just when you're done having
space and done pouting about it,

23:47.019 --> 23:49.622
we start hanging out again,
working to get back together

23:49.655 --> 23:50.522
and then you pick a fight
with me

23:50.556 --> 23:52.758
over the same old fucking shit
over again

23:52.792 --> 23:53.993
just so you can break up
with me.

23:54.026 --> 23:56.562
I mean, you know what, light
bulb, you're fucking awkward,

23:56.595 --> 23:57.997
so don't put your shit on me,
okay?

23:58.030 --> 23:59.632
I mean say what you want
about Patrick

23:59.665 --> 24:02.868
but the only person who
makes me feel this low is you.

24:05.304 --> 24:06.672
Nah, nigger.

24:20.953 --> 24:24.123
Alec, hey, Alec.

24:24.156 --> 24:26.892
We need you to come down to
the principal's office with us,

24:26.926 --> 24:27.927
real quick.

24:27.960 --> 24:29.562
Would that be okay?

24:29.595 --> 24:31.263
Would you come with us?

24:57.123 --> 25:00.659
What happened, Alec? Hmm?

25:02.194 --> 25:03.729
Please talk to me.

25:05.064 --> 25:07.299
What happened at school today,
honey?

25:08.901 --> 25:10.136
Why did you do that?

25:11.670 --> 25:13.072
You know what, you don't have
to talk about it if you don't want to

25:13.105 --> 25:14.774
but that's
what Wednesdays are for.

25:14.807 --> 25:16.976
You can let it all out with, uh,
Dr. Isaacs.

25:17.009 --> 25:18.044
We're almost there.

25:19.178 --> 25:21.080
Two, I even got you some
extra time for this session,

25:21.113 --> 25:24.950
so you just take all the time
you need to be good to go, okay?

25:24.984 --> 25:27.119
Turn around.
Just turn around, okay.

25:27.153 --> 25:28.320
Turn around.
Everything's going to be okay.

25:28.354 --> 25:30.022
Just keep facing the way
I'm facing him

25:30.056 --> 25:31.257
and everything's
going to be fine.

25:44.070 --> 25:46.272
I just don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do, Randy.

25:46.305 --> 25:47.106
There's something
wrong with him.

25:47.139 --> 25:50.342
There's something wrong
with our son

25:50.376 --> 25:52.111
and I knew it since he came out.

25:52.144 --> 25:54.080
No, don't say that.
He's just a little different.

25:54.113 --> 25:56.148
I was quiet when I was his age.
I'm fine, okay.

25:56.182 --> 25:57.783
I turned out fine.
He's going to be fine.

25:57.817 --> 25:59.051
He's just,
he's going through a phase,

25:59.085 --> 26:00.619
he needs a little coaxing
out of his shell,

26:00.653 --> 26:02.254
but he's strong,
my boy's a strong boy.

26:02.288 --> 26:03.389
- My mother was right.
- Hmm?

26:03.422 --> 26:04.957
This is all my fault.

26:04.990 --> 26:06.826
You mother's not right
about anything, Joanne, ever.

26:06.859 --> 26:08.661
- Oh, Randy!
- I'm sorry.

26:10.296 --> 26:12.398
You know he could have killed
that child. Do you know that?

26:12.431 --> 26:14.333
Do you understand that
he could have killed him?

26:15.134 --> 26:16.836
I mean, this is how
serial killers get started

26:16.869 --> 26:18.170
and there are always
warning signs,

26:18.204 --> 26:19.271
big glaring warning signs.

26:19.305 --> 26:22.241
What if this is it?
What if Alec is a serial killer?

26:22.274 --> 26:23.509
What would we do then?

26:23.543 --> 26:26.946
We will love him just the same
as long as he doesn't kill us.

26:26.979 --> 26:28.614
- Randy!
- I'm sorry.

26:29.381 --> 26:32.818
Look, just relax. Relax.

26:34.053 --> 26:35.855
I tell you what, let's go
to the farmers' market.

26:35.888 --> 26:37.123
Is there one today?

26:37.156 --> 26:40.025
We're gonna find one. I'm gonna
find a fucking farmers' market.

26:59.845 --> 27:00.980
How are you feeling today?

27:03.849 --> 27:05.317
It's fair to say you seem down.

27:06.352 --> 27:08.921
Well, 10 points for you.

27:10.389 --> 27:12.191
Have you seen my wallet?
Did I leave it here?

27:12.224 --> 27:13.659
I did. I left it out.

27:16.195 --> 27:17.830
Would you like to talk about it?

27:17.863 --> 27:18.964
What's to talk about?

27:19.865 --> 27:22.668
Things are just fucked up
with Millie.

27:23.836 --> 27:25.704
We'll just let it go
at this point.

27:25.738 --> 27:27.339
Um, yeah. That's a wrap.

27:27.373 --> 27:29.041
But where the fuck is my wallet?

27:34.246 --> 27:35.681
Why don't you
tell me what happened?

27:36.849 --> 27:37.883
Are you married, Doc?

27:39.518 --> 27:43.155
Well, I'm not here to talk
about my life, Gabe.

27:43.189 --> 27:44.723
Okay, that's not what
you pay me for.

27:44.757 --> 27:46.258
I'm here to talk about yours.

27:46.292 --> 27:49.261
Okay, well, my life sucks,
fade out, the end.

27:49.295 --> 27:51.197
Can we just... Can we talk about
something else?

27:51.230 --> 27:54.333
I don't think your life sucks
from my personal perspective.

27:55.434 --> 27:58.370
Look, you're alive,
you're physically healthy,

27:58.404 --> 28:01.207
you have the beginnings
of a successful business.

28:01.240 --> 28:04.043
You have a lot of things that
people work very hard for.

28:04.977 --> 28:08.047
I can, uh... I can get your
supraspinatus right as fuck.

28:12.451 --> 28:17.189
Have you given any more
thought to what makes Gabe happy?

28:17.823 --> 28:18.924
Yeah, yeah.

28:18.958 --> 28:21.193
Twix ice cream bars, remember?

28:22.294 --> 28:23.429
Where the fuck is my wallet?

28:23.462 --> 28:24.763
- Gabe?
- What?

28:30.069 --> 28:33.105
Okay, I got to tell you
something.

28:33.138 --> 28:35.975
Oh, wonderful!
What are you... Okay.

28:41.347 --> 28:43.749
I'm damn good at my job.

28:44.416 --> 28:47.319
I graduated top of my class.
I built my own practice.

28:47.353 --> 28:48.487
Yeah, I don't see
what any of that

28:48.520 --> 28:49.623
has to do with me.
This is my time.

28:49.656 --> 28:53.025
It is quite evident to me
that you're full of shit.

28:54.093 --> 28:55.794
Wow! Wow!

28:55.828 --> 28:58.130
Yeah, you know, I definitely
don't pay you for that.

28:58.163 --> 29:01.433
No. You think you pay me
to come in here,

29:01.467 --> 29:04.370
listen to your problems,
and empathize with you.

29:04.403 --> 29:08.107
And you want a gold star
because you're a black man

29:08.140 --> 29:11.010
who took the difficult
but necessary step

29:11.043 --> 29:13.445
to seek treatment
and better himself.

29:13.479 --> 29:16.215
You want to be commended

29:16.248 --> 29:19.351
because you think you're coming in
here and opening up, but you're not.

29:20.286 --> 29:22.955
What you really pay me for

29:23.623 --> 29:27.126
is to unlock
a much deeper part of yourself

29:27.159 --> 29:30.496
that is yearning to come out,
but that's impossible because,

29:30.530 --> 29:32.197
well, you keep lying
to yourself.

29:34.933 --> 29:36.835
So, go ahead. Keep it all in.

29:36.869 --> 29:38.571
Bullshit me all you want.

29:38.605 --> 29:41.006
I'll gladly keep taking
your money.

29:41.040 --> 29:43.543
I rather enjoy
eating at Mastro's

29:44.644 --> 29:47.046
but in the long run
it does you no good.

29:47.446 --> 29:49.181
Hey, how much does my insurance
pay you?

29:49.214 --> 29:50.249
A lot.

29:50.282 --> 29:52.818
Yeah, damn. Obamacare, right.

29:54.086 --> 29:55.287
Whatever, okay.

29:55.321 --> 29:57.222
I am honest.

29:57.256 --> 29:59.158
No, no, you're not.

29:59.191 --> 30:01.628
See, you come here
week after week

30:01.661 --> 30:03.929
and you say you're tired
of the same game

30:03.962 --> 30:06.031
you've been playing
your whole adult life.

30:07.667 --> 30:11.403
Gabe, you have a woman
who's ready

30:11.437 --> 30:13.872
for what you say
you're ready for,

30:15.240 --> 30:17.577
but instead of being a man
and putting in the work,

30:18.645 --> 30:21.980
you waste time
betting and investing

30:22.014 --> 30:25.517
in senseless relationships
just to prove the point

30:25.552 --> 30:28.555
that there are no
sustainable relationships.

30:28.588 --> 30:32.024
More failed tests
that you refuse to study for

30:33.025 --> 30:34.126
and the more you fail,

30:35.461 --> 30:37.996
the more you weave
this tangled web.

30:38.030 --> 30:39.566
Yeah, like a retarded
Spider-Man.

30:39.599 --> 30:42.434
Hey, keep telling your jokes.
You want to know what else?

30:42.468 --> 30:43.469
- No.
- You're hurt.

30:46.138 --> 30:47.039
You're afraid.

30:50.376 --> 30:51.276
Of what?

30:52.311 --> 30:54.681
Well, you don't want to end up
like your father

30:54.714 --> 30:56.448
and you definitely
don't want to end up

30:56.482 --> 30:58.050
with a woman like your mother.

30:58.083 --> 31:00.553
So, there's rock
and a hard place and you.

31:02.988 --> 31:04.890
You want to know what else?
You're hurt.

31:07.993 --> 31:10.597
You don't even know how to cope
with what's hurting you.

31:11.497 --> 31:14.199
You're so scared that
if you let your guard down

31:14.233 --> 31:19.104
and you let someone in and they
see you, they see the real you,

31:19.138 --> 31:23.041
flaws and all, you're scared
that they will still love you.

31:25.177 --> 31:27.680
And you don't think
you deserve that love

31:27.714 --> 31:29.214
because you live in the world

31:29.248 --> 31:32.084
where you are constantly told
that you don't.

31:34.019 --> 31:35.320
I'm here to tell you
that you do.

31:38.457 --> 31:39.559
You deserve that love.

31:41.594 --> 31:42.961
You deserve to be happy,

31:48.500 --> 31:50.035
but you have to believe that.

31:52.104 --> 31:53.238
Time's up.

31:54.206 --> 31:57.176
Yeah, I'm tired of hearing
you talk anyway.

32:33.613 --> 32:35.080
What's up little man?
What you doing?

32:35.113 --> 32:36.048
Just sitting.

32:37.349 --> 32:38.183
Where's your grandmother?

32:38.217 --> 32:41.019
She forgot to pick me up.
She's old.

32:41.053 --> 32:45.357
Huh, well,
how you gonna get home?

32:47.359 --> 32:48.093
I don't know.

32:49.194 --> 32:50.429
I mean, do you live far
from here?

32:50.462 --> 32:52.799
I mean, I can give you a ride.

32:52.832 --> 32:54.667
Nay, I don't want to bother you,
Mister.

32:57.236 --> 32:59.171
- Yo, what are you doing?
- Hitch-hiking.

33:00.072 --> 33:01.306
It's what they do in the movies.

33:01.340 --> 33:04.309
Yo, listen. No, nobody does that
anymore, man.

33:04.343 --> 33:07.246
Look, it's cool. Just... I can
give you a ride home. Yeah?

33:07.279 --> 33:08.480
- Okay.
- All right, come on.

33:13.285 --> 33:17.557
No, no. Get in the front
seat, the front seat, the front.

33:25.798 --> 33:29.067
- Oh, I'm Gabe by the way.
- Alec.

33:29.101 --> 33:30.369
That way you're not roaming
with a stranger.

33:30.402 --> 33:32.404
- Right.
- Put your seat back, relax.

33:34.172 --> 33:35.507
So, where to?

33:35.542 --> 33:39.812
Um, go out...
Go up here and make a left.

33:50.155 --> 33:52.524
Oh, so, uh, how long have you
been in therapy?

33:52.559 --> 33:54.627
Oh, it's about three
to four months.

33:54.661 --> 33:56.395
Pretty new.
How about you?

33:57.597 --> 33:59.197
Two years.

33:59.231 --> 34:01.233
Two years?
How old are you?

34:01.266 --> 34:02.869
- Nine.
- Nine?

34:02.902 --> 34:05.538
Man, when I was nine,
I was running around outside,

34:05.572 --> 34:08.507
getting bit by mosquitoes,
playing with my friends.

34:08.541 --> 34:11.243
Kids need way more of that
these days. Fuck therapy.

34:12.344 --> 34:14.614
- Pardon my language.
- It's okay.

34:14.647 --> 34:16.415
I say that word sometimes.

34:16.447 --> 34:17.684
Oh, you do?

34:17.717 --> 34:20.452
Yeah, my parents
don't know though.

34:21.320 --> 34:23.221
I say a bunch of words.

34:23.822 --> 34:25.389
They think I'm real quiet.

34:26.224 --> 34:27.560
I don't know why.

34:28.360 --> 34:30.295
I guess I just don't
talk to them.

34:31.163 --> 34:32.532
It's about how it usually goes.

34:36.803 --> 34:39.304
Oh, make a right here.

34:44.409 --> 34:46.143
Do you have any rap music?

34:46.813 --> 34:48.447
What do you know
about rap music?

34:48.480 --> 34:49.748
I like it.

34:50.415 --> 34:51.449
My neighbor Tommy.

34:51.483 --> 34:53.284
His older brother likes
rap music.

34:54.821 --> 34:56.889
We used to sneak in his room
and listen to it.

34:56.922 --> 34:58.791
I think I'll be a great rapper.

34:59.358 --> 35:01.527
- You know how to spit?
- Yeah.

35:02.829 --> 35:05.698
No. No, man. That's... Not spit.

35:05.732 --> 35:07.800
Spit like, like freestyle.

35:07.834 --> 35:09.301
You know, make it up as you go.

35:09.334 --> 35:12.204
Yeah, oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I'm the best.

35:12.237 --> 35:14.574
- Really?
- Yeah, I'm the best in my class.

35:14.607 --> 35:16.441
Okay, well, you know what,
let's see what you got.

35:18.611 --> 35:19.712
Okay, yeah.

35:19.746 --> 35:21.413
Do something,
do something with that.

35:22.915 --> 35:26.919
Oh, okay. You got a mic too,
huh? Okay. Yeah.

35:26.953 --> 35:30.923
<i>♪ It's me, Alec
A.L.E.C. ridin' in a car ♪</i>

35:30.957 --> 35:33.392
<i>♪ Going real fast
Making it rain ♪</i>

35:33.425 --> 35:34.426
<i>♪ Twerk something, yeah ♪</i>

35:34.459 --> 35:37.329
Okay, yeah. No. No. No.

35:37.362 --> 35:41.366
Stop. Stop it. Stop.
Stop that.

35:41.934 --> 35:43.402
I thought
I was doing good though.

35:43.435 --> 35:44.871
Nah, you thought wrong.

35:44.904 --> 35:46.572
Just, you know what?

35:46.606 --> 35:50.375
When you think about rapping,
just don't, you know.

35:51.476 --> 35:53.345
- Okay.
- Okay.

35:55.982 --> 35:58.316
- Start slowing down.
- Over here?

35:58.350 --> 35:59.317
Right over there, yeah.

36:02.254 --> 36:05.323
Well, all right, little man.
It's fun hanging with you.

36:05.357 --> 36:06.726
Yeah, okay.

36:06.759 --> 36:08.360
See you next Wednesday?

36:08.393 --> 36:09.562
- Yep, okay.
- Cool.

36:09.595 --> 36:12.865
Wait, okay, could you just
wait here so I make it in okay?

36:12.899 --> 36:13.866
Yeah, sure.

36:43.295 --> 36:45.565
Wait, what's wrong? Nobody home?

36:46.364 --> 36:48.701
Yeah, nobody's there.

36:48.735 --> 36:52.337
Probably thought my grandma's
gonna take me to her house

36:52.370 --> 36:53.940
- and, yeah.
- Oh!

36:54.741 --> 36:56.676
Well, what time do your parents
normally get home?

36:56.709 --> 36:57.810
Around 6:00.

36:58.745 --> 37:00.412
That is...
It's just after 3:00.

37:01.513 --> 37:03.315
I can't leave you out here
for like three hours.

37:05.317 --> 37:06.284
Are you hungry?

37:06.318 --> 37:07.352
I'm starving.

37:07.385 --> 37:09.689
Didn't really get to finish
my lunch at school.

37:09.722 --> 37:11.924
All right.
Well, I left my wallet at home,

37:11.958 --> 37:14.594
but I got about 17 bucks.

37:15.061 --> 37:16.829
Let's see what we can get
with that?

37:16.863 --> 37:18.430
- Deal?
- Deal.

37:18.898 --> 37:19.832
All right.

37:33.646 --> 37:35.548
Right, you really
were hungry, huh?

37:35.581 --> 37:37.817
Told you, I didn't get
to finish my lunch.

37:38.818 --> 37:40.653
Never fixed your kicks
like I told you either.

37:41.921 --> 37:43.355
Nah, it's okay.

37:43.388 --> 37:44.757
I'm going to get some
new ones soon.

37:46.058 --> 37:48.360
Dad said if I join
a baseball team or something,

37:48.393 --> 37:49.394
he'll give me some money.

37:50.730 --> 37:52.364
He thinks team sports
will help me out.

37:53.566 --> 37:55.300
I used to play baseball
when I was a kid.

37:55.802 --> 37:58.037
I hated defense, but I loved
hitting things with a bat.

37:58.704 --> 38:01.073
I still go to the batting cages
to this day when I'm stressed.

38:01.974 --> 38:03.943
- You fast?
- I'm okay.

38:05.011 --> 38:06.946
You know what?
Be a pitcher.

38:06.979 --> 38:08.815
You don't have to be fast
to be a pitcher

38:08.848 --> 38:09.982
and you make more money.

38:11.717 --> 38:13.351
I don't like throwing
and catching.

38:13.820 --> 38:15.420
Well, maybe you shouldn't
play baseball.

38:16.789 --> 38:18.624
I really just want
some new shoes.

38:19.826 --> 38:21.393
Oh, crap.

38:24.997 --> 38:28.801
Wait! Is that Patty Nelson?

38:28.835 --> 38:30.570
Yeah, that's Patty Nelson.

38:30.603 --> 38:32.672
You're friends
with Patty Nelson?

38:32.705 --> 38:33.773
- Something like that.
- Lucky!

38:35.975 --> 38:37.977
Huh. Wait a minute!

38:39.145 --> 38:40.478
Hmm.

38:40.512 --> 38:41.647
How'd you get that bruise?

38:42.447 --> 38:43.549
Your parents did that to you?

38:44.083 --> 38:46.152
No way. They believe in timeouts

38:46.185 --> 38:48.420
and putting your hands
on your hips and stuff.

38:48.453 --> 38:49.622
They never hit me.

38:50.455 --> 38:51.456
You're getting bullied.

38:52.191 --> 38:53.693
They did that to your shoes,
too.

38:54.560 --> 38:55.895
I know bully work when I see it.

38:56.494 --> 38:57.797
I used to get bullied
when I was a kid.

38:57.830 --> 38:59.732
- You did?
- Yep.

39:00.199 --> 39:01.901
Then you'll grow up,
start getting some muscles,

39:01.934 --> 39:04.402
all that bullying stuff
will stop, promise.

39:04.436 --> 39:06.138
No, not these guys.

39:08.074 --> 39:09.609
You got to see them every day?

39:09.642 --> 39:11.509
Yeah, they're even
on the baseball team

39:11.544 --> 39:12.745
my dad wants me to join.

39:14.580 --> 39:15.915
One of the only good things
about therapy

39:15.948 --> 39:17.617
being on Wednesdays is that

39:17.650 --> 39:19.719
I don't have to go to their
stupid practice.

39:20.186 --> 39:23.623
Wait, they have practice
right now?

39:23.656 --> 39:25.157
Yeah, probably just
finishing up.

39:25.191 --> 39:27.492
- Why?
- Come on.

39:28.027 --> 39:29.427
- Where are we going?
- Just come on.

39:31.063 --> 39:33.833
- I don't like surprises.
- Yeah, you'll like this one.

39:34.800 --> 39:36.602
- I want to do it, man.
- Do it.

39:37.570 --> 39:38.905
You don't think
I'm going to do it?

39:38.938 --> 39:40.840
- I just said do it.
- I'll do it. You did it.

39:40.873 --> 39:42.474
- I did do it.
- You don't think I can't do it?

39:42.507 --> 39:44.644
You've been talking about
doing it for two years. Do it.

39:48.681 --> 39:51.951
That's two of them.
Luke and Kyle.

39:52.685 --> 39:55.554
They once gave me a wedgie
so hard, it made me bleed.

39:59.692 --> 40:04.196
Here, put this on.
Put this on like this.

40:06.699 --> 40:07.600
Yeah.

40:09.669 --> 40:11.070
No, on the ear like this.

40:11.103 --> 40:13.839
Did she really take
half your stuff? Half?

40:13.873 --> 40:17.710
I mean, no. She got
the whole house, all the kids,

40:17.743 --> 40:20.680
the Range, not half of it,
the boathouse, the boat.

40:21.147 --> 40:23.182
I mean...
I mean, come on.

40:23.215 --> 40:26.185
- Let me just stare it.
- Look at that thing, man.

40:32.625 --> 40:33.926
Oh, damn it.

40:33.960 --> 40:35.928
Come here, come here,
just gotta hand me out

40:39.565 --> 40:42.001
I would let her take half
of anything from me.

40:42.034 --> 40:45.237
Yeah, oh, yeah.
Come back. Come back. Come back.

40:45.271 --> 40:46.172
Dad.

40:46.839 --> 40:49.675
Hey! Shut up! Shut up!

40:50.142 --> 40:53.279
Hey! Hey, get off my kid.

40:56.916 --> 40:57.950
Hey.

41:03.789 --> 41:05.091
You're such a joke.

41:13.299 --> 41:16.969
- That was awesome.
- Uh-huh.

41:17.003 --> 41:19.205
Yeah, I bet they won't be
messing with your shoes anymore.

41:19.238 --> 41:22.241
I was like pow, pow,
pow on his stomach.

41:22.274 --> 41:24.944
Uh-huh. I think the other one
peed on himself.

41:24.977 --> 41:28.914
Uh-huh, that's what they get.
Police.

41:28.948 --> 41:30.049
Police.

41:30.082 --> 41:31.851
Take that. You're good now.

41:31.884 --> 41:33.886
- That was hilarious.
- Yeah.

42:01.614 --> 42:04.617
All right, little man.
Had a crazy day today.

42:04.650 --> 42:06.819
Yeah. Thanks for the help
and the ride.

42:06.852 --> 42:07.987
Yeah, for sure.

42:08.020 --> 42:09.889
I'll see you next Wednesday,
I guess.

42:09.922 --> 42:11.223
Mm-Hm. Yeah, okay.

42:12.258 --> 42:14.794
- Wait.
- Wait, what?

42:17.196 --> 42:18.664
This...

42:18.697 --> 42:19.899
This is not my house.

42:21.100 --> 42:22.268
What do you mean
this is not your house?

42:22.301 --> 42:23.202
We were just there.

42:24.937 --> 42:29.008
Wait, I don't think this is
my neighborhood actually.

42:30.843 --> 42:32.144
What do you mean
this isn't your neighborhood?

42:32.178 --> 42:33.746
We were just there.
That's your house.

42:33.779 --> 42:35.614
You don't know what
neighborhood you live in?

42:35.648 --> 42:38.984
I do. I just... I've never been
in the front seat before.

42:39.018 --> 42:41.087
Everything looks different
from up here.

42:41.787 --> 42:42.922
Oh, my God!
All right, here.

42:42.955 --> 42:45.658
Look, just call your mom

42:45.691 --> 42:47.893
and I'll explain the situation
to her. It'll be cool.

42:47.927 --> 42:49.962
I don't know my mom's number
by memory.

42:50.696 --> 42:51.764
Okay, well, call your dad.

42:52.331 --> 42:53.632
I don't either. Nope.

42:55.034 --> 42:56.268
Well, dude, how are we supposed
to get you home

42:56.302 --> 42:57.403
when you don't know
how to get home?

42:57.436 --> 43:00.706
Like, can you explain
what your house even looks like?

43:00.739 --> 43:01.907
I mean, this doesn't make
any sense.

43:01.941 --> 43:04.710
- Well, it's big.
- Okay.

43:06.245 --> 43:07.746
- Two stories.
- Okay.

43:07.780 --> 43:11.250
And um, it's by the beach.

43:11.917 --> 43:13.385
By the beach,
nigga, we in the valley.

43:15.154 --> 43:17.356
- Alec, we're in the valley.
- It's okay.

43:17.389 --> 43:19.258
I know you don't mean it
in a bad way.

43:19.291 --> 43:22.194
You mean it like the rappers do,
like friends.

43:22.862 --> 43:24.263
All right, look.
I got to get gas.

43:24.296 --> 43:26.365
You got any money on you
at least?

43:26.398 --> 43:27.266
No.

43:29.869 --> 43:32.905
Got to go home, get my wallet,
get some gas

43:32.938 --> 43:34.807
and figure out
how to get you home.

43:34.840 --> 43:35.808
Okay.

43:36.842 --> 43:38.277
This don't make no sense.

43:43.182 --> 43:45.084
Bro, what is she doing here?

43:48.420 --> 43:49.922
Stay right here.
I'll be right back.

43:49.955 --> 43:51.123
Okay.

43:56.996 --> 43:57.897
Bailey, what are you doing here?

43:57.930 --> 43:59.999
You haven't been getting
any of my texts?

44:00.466 --> 44:03.369
Oh! Oh, I hope you die,
and your dick falls off.

44:03.402 --> 44:04.638
- That's been you?
- Yes.

44:04.670 --> 44:07.306
Right. Well, there's a
reason I deleted your number,

44:07.339 --> 44:09.475
so, again,
what are you doing here?

44:09.508 --> 44:10.709
I'm on break from work
and I've been waiting for you

44:10.743 --> 44:13.712
to get home, so I can go in
and get the rest of my stuff.

44:13.746 --> 44:14.847
What are you talking about?
You didn't leave anything.

44:14.880 --> 44:16.148
Yes, I did.

44:16.182 --> 44:18.150
I have a pair of earrings and
a scarf and I can't find them,

44:18.184 --> 44:19.118
so they must be in there.

44:19.151 --> 44:21.020
You didn't leave
your stuff here. I promise.

44:21.053 --> 44:22.755
Can you just let me go in
and look for it?

44:22.788 --> 44:23.822
I mean, it won't take long.

44:23.856 --> 44:24.658
Bailey, you're tripping.

44:24.690 --> 44:25.524
You know I don't have
your stuff.

44:25.559 --> 44:26.626
Did you look
under the bed?

44:26.660 --> 44:29.161
I don't have your scarf
and earrings, okay?

44:29.195 --> 44:30.262
I mean, shit happens

44:30.296 --> 44:32.264
when you're doing the
bucking bronco on the wall.

44:32.298 --> 44:33.999
Come on, it must have fallen off
or something.

44:34.033 --> 44:35.768
Just let me go in. Come on.

44:35.801 --> 44:36.802
You have five minutes,

44:36.835 --> 44:38.137
'cause I don't have time
for whatever this is.

44:38.170 --> 44:39.338
Okay, five minutes. Damn.

44:39.371 --> 44:40.406
- Five minutes.
- Five.

44:40.439 --> 44:41.440
Come on, Alec.

44:42.341 --> 44:43.742
I got time for this.

44:49.081 --> 44:51.417
- Who is this little white boy?
- Don't worry about it. Come on.

44:51.450 --> 44:52.751
Just come on.

44:57.156 --> 44:58.123
There it is.

45:02.094 --> 45:06.365
Okay, right? So, as you can see,
clearly your stuff isn't here.

45:06.398 --> 45:07.967
- Can you please go?
- Don't rush me,

45:08.000 --> 45:09.235
those earrings meant a lot
to me.

45:09.268 --> 45:11.136
I'm gonna go in the bedroom
and check.

45:11.804 --> 45:13.839
It's where we would've
spent most of our time.

45:21.080 --> 45:22.381
She smells like vanilla.

45:23.115 --> 45:26.018
- Cocoa butter.
- What's that?

45:26.051 --> 45:28.354
- What's what?
- Cocoa butter.

45:28.387 --> 45:32.057
Oh, it's... It's like,
you know what, I...

45:32.091 --> 45:33.225
I don't know what it is.

45:33.259 --> 45:36.295
It's kind of like lotion,
but it's not.

45:36.328 --> 45:39.331
Like black people use it
for everything.

45:39.365 --> 45:41.967
Hmm.
Oh, is she your girlfriend?

45:42.602 --> 45:45.137
No, no, no, no. She's just a
bunch of whiskey shots

45:45.170 --> 45:47.006
and a mistake.
That's... That's what she is.

45:47.039 --> 45:47.906
Hmm.

45:48.841 --> 45:50.009
Gabriel.

45:50.843 --> 45:52.077
I'll be right back.

45:55.414 --> 45:57.916
Uh, Bailey. What are you doing?

45:57.950 --> 45:59.418
I know somebody's been here.

45:59.451 --> 46:01.253
Your room has never been
this fucking clean.

46:01.287 --> 46:03.856
- Look at this.
- Okay, I need you to understand.

46:03.889 --> 46:06.125
You look like a bona fide
crazy person right now

46:06.158 --> 46:07.826
and it's actually making me
uncomfortable.

46:07.860 --> 46:10.095
I don't care. I want to know
who you've been with.

46:10.129 --> 46:12.364
Bailey, we haven't kicked
it in damn near two months.

46:12.398 --> 46:14.266
I told you,
I got a girlfriend now.

46:14.300 --> 46:15.868
Yeah, that was after
we had already had sex

46:15.901 --> 46:16.869
a thousand times.

46:16.902 --> 46:17.803
We had sex twice.

46:17.836 --> 46:19.505
And then you went
and you got a girlfriend

46:19.539 --> 46:20.906
and you didn't even tell me.

46:20.939 --> 46:22.441
Me getting a girlfriend
was the reason

46:22.474 --> 46:23.475
you and I stopped talking.

46:23.509 --> 46:24.843
Do you not remember?

46:24.877 --> 46:27.479
That's when you hung up.
It was the first time you had texted me,

46:27.513 --> 46:31.584
"Hey, I hope you die in a fiery crash on
101 North with your dick in your hands."

46:31.618 --> 46:34.853
- Remember that?
- I was... I was just upset.

46:34.887 --> 46:37.256
Baby, let's just... let's just
have sex and make up.

46:37.289 --> 46:38.190
Bailey, stop.

46:38.223 --> 46:41.393
What? What!
Is her pussy that good? Huh?

46:41.427 --> 46:43.329
I know it's that little yamp
Millie. Is it her?

46:43.362 --> 46:45.331
'Cause I went on her
little Instagram page

46:45.364 --> 46:47.266
and I saw some love quotes
she posted

46:47.299 --> 46:49.636
and I know it was about
your dumb stupid ass.

46:49.669 --> 46:50.969
Okay, thank you very much.

46:51.003 --> 46:52.137
Now it's time for you to go,
please.

46:52.171 --> 46:53.573
Right this way. Uh-huh.

46:53.606 --> 46:55.240
Are you two still
seeing each other?

46:57.176 --> 46:59.579
It's complicated. Why?
Just go.

46:59.612 --> 47:02.014
'Cause I'm pregnant
and it's yours.

47:04.149 --> 47:06.218
- What?
- Yep, you heard me right.

47:07.486 --> 47:09.221
Pregnant.

47:09.689 --> 47:11.256
So, what you gonna do, Gabe?

47:11.290 --> 47:15.361
You going to be a deadbeat or are you
gonna do what's best for me and Gabe Jr.?

47:16.028 --> 47:17.229
Oh, I got to get back to work.

47:17.262 --> 47:21.133
Listen, I'll be back tonight,

47:21.166 --> 47:24.169
so we can discuss
what the plan is gonna be.

47:25.137 --> 47:28.173
My mom is not going to be
happy with you

47:28.207 --> 47:29.274
but you're going to love her.

47:30.409 --> 47:32.277
Okay, I'll see you later.

47:44.423 --> 47:45.491
Everything okay?

47:51.964 --> 47:52.998
Whiskey.

47:54.166 --> 47:56.135
Hey, isn't that the stuff
you were just talking about?

47:56.168 --> 47:57.604
Makes you make bad decisions.

48:01.106 --> 48:02.074
Is it any good?

48:06.278 --> 48:07.413
Can I have some?

48:23.429 --> 48:24.329
See.

48:27.399 --> 48:31.203
If it... if it's nasty and it
makes you make bad decisions

48:31.236 --> 48:33.472
then, um, why do you drink it?

48:34.473 --> 48:36.108
That is a good question.

48:41.480 --> 48:43.048
Oh, fuck this shit.

48:49.589 --> 48:51.089
Oh, shit! Come on.

48:52.191 --> 48:53.392
What are you gonna do with that?

48:53.425 --> 48:54.293
Hit shit.

49:07.172 --> 49:09.709
- You're gonna hurt yourself.
- Just keep them coming.

49:16.315 --> 49:17.449
Feel better yet?

49:18.484 --> 49:21.186
- Not really.
- Can I try?

49:22.521 --> 49:23.623
I thought you said
you didn't like baseball.

49:23.656 --> 49:26.124
I said I didn't like the bullies
that play in the team

49:26.158 --> 49:27.493
and throwing and catching.

49:27.527 --> 49:29.361
Never said anything
about hitting.

49:29.394 --> 49:31.631
You know omission
is a form of a lie, right?

49:31.664 --> 49:32.765
Your parents ever
teach you that?

49:33.833 --> 49:36.435
So, like when you don't tell
your real girlfriend

49:36.468 --> 49:38.070
that you got another girl
pregnant.

49:38.638 --> 49:40.138
Is that like a lie?

49:42.374 --> 49:44.409
If my son is anything like you,
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

49:44.443 --> 49:45.410
Nobody's like me.

49:46.278 --> 49:49.181
But you just have to talk
to him, not at him.

49:49.582 --> 49:51.350
That's why I ignore my parents.

49:52.685 --> 49:55.454
That's why I go to my room
and play video games.

50:08.133 --> 50:09.501
Take that off.

50:09.536 --> 50:11.069
What are you wearing that for
anyway?

50:11.103 --> 50:11.771
Put that on.

50:16.408 --> 50:17.342
Oh, yeah.

50:22.247 --> 50:23.448
How do I do this?

50:23.482 --> 50:25.652
You just see it and hit it.
It's pretty simple actually.

50:29.689 --> 50:31.691
- Ready?
- No.

50:35.595 --> 50:36.663
No, you got to...
you got to swing at it.

50:36.696 --> 50:38.297
I told you I wasn't ready.

50:38.330 --> 50:40.132
Well, if you stay ready,
you don't have to get ready.

50:40.700 --> 50:42.535
- Ready?
- Sure.

50:42.569 --> 50:43.703
Okay.

50:46.305 --> 50:48.440
I quit! I'm done.

50:48.473 --> 50:50.309
No, you can't quit.
I mean, sometimes you miss.

50:50.342 --> 50:51.844
You just do it again.
It's okay.

50:51.878 --> 50:54.313
- I don't want to try again.
- No, you have to.

50:54.346 --> 50:55.715
I don't want to do it.
I don't want to do it.

50:55.748 --> 50:57.316
- I don't want to do it.
- What the...

50:57.349 --> 50:59.451
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9...
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

50:59.484 --> 51:00.820
Boy, what the f...
Hey, boy!

51:00.853 --> 51:02.555
You'll settle down
in this batting cage.

51:02.589 --> 51:04.289
- What's wrong with you?
- I can't do it.

51:04.323 --> 51:05.892
That's 'cause you're
running around yelling numbers

51:05.925 --> 51:06.826
and not hitting the ball.

51:06.859 --> 51:07.860
I need a timeout.

51:07.894 --> 51:09.596
Hey, fuck a timeout.

51:09.629 --> 51:10.630
You're gonna stand up here

51:10.663 --> 51:12.599
and you're gonna hit
one of these balls, okay?

51:13.600 --> 51:14.834
Okay.

51:15.535 --> 51:16.636
Come on.

51:18.638 --> 51:19.806
Fucking timeout.

51:23.408 --> 51:26.546
Now, here we go, all right?

51:31.718 --> 51:34.787
It's okay. It's okay.
Don't go all Hulk on me.

51:34.821 --> 51:37.222
Just try again, all right?

51:37.690 --> 51:38.858
You can do this.

51:48.233 --> 51:50.670
- There you go. There you go.
- Gabe, Gabe, I touched it.

51:50.703 --> 51:51.938
- Yeah, you see that?
- I did it. Did you see?

51:51.971 --> 51:53.138
Yeah. Yeah, I saw that.

51:53.171 --> 51:56.174
Right, now, see look, when life
gets hard, you don't quit.

51:56.208 --> 51:58.678
You stand in that box
and you figure it out, right?

51:58.711 --> 51:59.679
Yeah.

52:06.719 --> 52:07.654
What's wrong?

52:10.890 --> 52:12.659
I'm not ready to be a dad, man.

52:13.926 --> 52:14.927
Not like this.

52:15.561 --> 52:16.763
You'll be a cool dad.

52:16.796 --> 52:18.665
My dad never does stuff
like this with me.

52:25.370 --> 52:26.438
It's Millie.

52:26.471 --> 52:28.641
Millie.
Is that your real girlfriend?

52:29.709 --> 52:30.677
I think so.

52:31.944 --> 52:34.547
- Should I answer?
- Yes.

52:35.480 --> 52:36.783
Okay, last question.

52:36.816 --> 52:39.251
Should I tell her in person
or on the phone?

52:40.953 --> 52:43.188
- Definitely in person.
- Yeah.

52:45.390 --> 52:47.660
Hello. Hey.

52:48.995 --> 52:52.330
Yeah, yeah. I'm just finishing
up at the batting cages.

52:52.999 --> 52:55.500
Hey, I need to, um, I need to
talk to you about something.

52:55.902 --> 52:57.804
I can... I can swing by.
Are you gonna be there?

52:59.572 --> 53:01.941
Okay. Okay,
I'll see you in a bit.

53:06.879 --> 53:09.514
- A card.
- What?

53:09.549 --> 53:12.484
Get her a card.
Girls like cards, don't they?

53:16.521 --> 53:18.791
Ow! What did you do that for?

53:18.825 --> 53:20.593
You'll thank me later in life,
I promise.

53:20.626 --> 53:22.729
Okay, I won't say,
I won't think about saying it.

53:22.762 --> 53:23.629
Boom.

53:24.362 --> 53:26.465
Here, put that on your ear.

53:32.705 --> 53:34.674
Oh, oh, excuse me, sir.
Sorry, can you come back.

53:34.707 --> 53:36.408
It's just the Bing Bong.

53:36.441 --> 53:37.777
Oh, the Bing Bong
must be broken,

53:37.810 --> 53:39.846
'cause, clearly,
I just paid for this.

53:39.879 --> 53:41.480
I doubt it, man.

53:41.513 --> 53:44.483
Let me just... All right,
if I can... let me just...

53:44.516 --> 53:45.551
- What are you doing?
- Make sure...

53:45.585 --> 53:47.019
Get off me, man.
We got money.

53:47.053 --> 53:48.554
I ain't taking nothing
from this damn store.

53:48.588 --> 53:50.022
Yeah, I know you do, man,
but I just...

53:50.056 --> 53:51.256
Come on. I got to...

53:52.390 --> 53:53.492
Don't... quit frisking me, dude.

53:53.526 --> 53:55.494
Hey, man,
let's record this shit, man.

53:55.528 --> 53:57.764
I just told you I didn't take
nothing from this damn store.

53:57.797 --> 53:58.731
I'm going to call the cops.

53:58.765 --> 54:00.332
Call... call the cops, for what?

54:00.933 --> 54:02.902
You just saw me buy this.
I didn't do nothing.

54:02.935 --> 54:05.605
All right, well, if you didn't do
nothing just let me frisk you, man.

54:05.638 --> 54:06.906
- Come on.
- No.

54:06.939 --> 54:10.408
I promise you,
if you touch me one more time,

54:10.442 --> 54:11.911
I'm going to smack the shit
out of you.

54:17.482 --> 54:18.651
Ow.

54:25.892 --> 54:26.893
Did you see?

54:29.862 --> 54:31.731
Right? Right, I told him.

54:32.464 --> 54:33.733
Yep, I heard you tell him.

54:33.766 --> 54:35.400
Cause and effect.

54:35.433 --> 54:37.970
Totally. Totally understand.

54:38.704 --> 54:40.405
Called racist profiling.

54:40.907 --> 54:42.374
We learn about that in school.

54:47.079 --> 54:47.947
What?

54:48.848 --> 54:49.749
Where the...

54:51.416 --> 54:52.685
- Are you serious?
- You want some?

54:52.718 --> 54:54.554
No. Give me that.

54:59.559 --> 55:01.727
I'm sorry I slapped you,
kinda.

55:02.394 --> 55:03.495
But that's not why we're here.

55:06.464 --> 55:07.533
I'm saying.

55:08.968 --> 55:12.104
I took this without paying.

55:12.872 --> 55:13.773
You took it.

55:14.740 --> 55:16.642
That's... that's why
the Bing Bong, 'cause...

55:16.676 --> 55:18.578
- 'Cause you took it.
- Mm-hm, genius.

55:19.879 --> 55:21.781
Okay, so what do you want to do,
restock it or something?

55:21.814 --> 55:24.584
No. Just tell me how much it is
so I can pay for it

55:24.617 --> 55:27.854
- and I can go about my...
- You slapped me for no reason.

55:27.887 --> 55:28.988
No, no, no.

55:29.021 --> 55:30.890
Cause and effect
got you slapped, okay?

55:30.923 --> 55:31.791
But that's not the point.

55:31.824 --> 55:33.326
Trying to teach him
a valuable lesson.

55:33.358 --> 55:36.596
Are you guys in like the Big Brothers,
Big Sisters program or something?

55:36.629 --> 55:38.130
You know I've... I've seen that

55:38.164 --> 55:40.900
but I've never seen a black adult and
a white kid. It's usually like uh...

55:40.933 --> 55:42.935
Hey, I don't want you to say
extra words.

55:42.969 --> 55:44.804
Tell me how much this
fucking candy bar is

55:44.837 --> 55:45.905
so I can go about my day, okay?

55:45.938 --> 55:47.940
Well, there's no wrapper on it,
so I can't scan it.

55:47.974 --> 55:49.175
Scan another one.

55:49.208 --> 55:51.711
If I scan another one that's
gonna be a separate transaction.

55:51.744 --> 55:53.045
So, I'm gonna have to
void this one out.

55:53.079 --> 55:54.146
So?

55:54.180 --> 55:57.183
So, my manager doesn't like
when I void things out.

55:57.216 --> 55:58.551
He's going to slap you again.

55:58.584 --> 56:00.720
Scan another bar,
tell me how much it is.

56:00.753 --> 56:02.889
He's been having
a very, very bad day.

56:02.922 --> 56:04.590
Alec!

56:04.624 --> 56:06.158
Hey, how much is it?

56:20.840 --> 56:22.742
Hand me a napkin out of
the glove compartment.

56:25.912 --> 56:26.913
This.

56:29.081 --> 56:30.016
Hand me the card.

56:33.986 --> 56:35.821
You got a little chocolate
on your hands.

56:38.824 --> 56:40.693
There's a little bit
around your thumb.

56:43.162 --> 56:44.130
There's some on your wrist.

56:44.163 --> 56:45.798
Just give it. It's fine.
Just give it to me.

56:45.831 --> 56:47.033
Just give it to me.
Thank you.

56:50.670 --> 56:51.837
So, what are you gonna say?

56:53.205 --> 56:58.110
Like, I love you. I'm sorry and a
big jerk or something like that.

56:58.144 --> 56:59.078
What do you think?

56:59.111 --> 57:01.847
I don't know.
I've never had girlfriends.

57:02.581 --> 57:03.683
You're too young anyway.

57:04.583 --> 57:07.119
Well, there's just one girl,
Sarah.

57:07.920 --> 57:09.021
She goes to my school.

57:10.256 --> 57:11.824
She's kind of like
my girlfriend.

57:12.591 --> 57:13.626
Hmm.

57:13.659 --> 57:15.561
Just I haven't told her yet so.

57:15.594 --> 57:17.630
Yeah, no. I don't think you can
call her your girlfriend then.

57:17.663 --> 57:19.065
Oh, but she is my girlfriend.

57:20.232 --> 57:23.069
She is, yeah.

57:24.003 --> 57:25.037
All right. Come on.

57:29.575 --> 57:31.243
Wait, I have anything
in my teeth?

57:32.578 --> 57:34.680
I can't tell.
Your gums are black.

57:35.848 --> 57:38.050
Do all black people
have black gums?

57:38.084 --> 57:39.018
I don't know.

57:40.052 --> 57:42.520
- Why?
- Why what?

57:42.555 --> 57:44.156
Why are my gums black
or why don't I know

57:44.190 --> 57:47.126
if every black person
in the world has black gums?

57:47.159 --> 57:48.594
The first one.

57:48.627 --> 57:51.964
I don't know, black people and white
people are the same, but different.

58:03.843 --> 58:04.744
Hi.

58:06.712 --> 58:07.680
Can we come in?

58:24.196 --> 58:28.067
So, Gabe, who's this?

58:28.934 --> 58:29.869
I'm Alec.

58:30.703 --> 58:32.304
You got any lemonade
or something?

58:32.338 --> 58:33.706
Hi, Alec.

58:33.739 --> 58:35.741
Whose little white kid
did you steal?

58:36.308 --> 58:37.309
This is for you.

58:41.747 --> 58:45.651
And as far as Alec goes, we go to the
same therapist building on the same days.

58:45.684 --> 58:47.153
We see each other
on the elevator sometimes

58:47.186 --> 58:49.088
- after sessions.
- We're best friends.

58:49.121 --> 58:51.924
He called me the N word earlier,
but in a good way.

58:51.957 --> 58:53.959
- Really, Gabe? Really?
- It just slipped out.

58:56.395 --> 58:58.597
- Have you been drinking?
- No.

58:58.631 --> 59:00.066
You just gonna lie
to me now?

59:00.099 --> 59:01.167
You know I can always smell
alcohol on you,

59:01.200 --> 59:02.334
you have thin blood.

59:02.368 --> 59:03.803
You've been drinking whiskey.

59:03.836 --> 59:06.138
Okay, a little, earlier.

59:06.172 --> 59:09.375
He gave me some, too.
It was gross.

59:09.408 --> 59:11.343
I'm having a rough day, okay?
I'm grown.

59:11.377 --> 59:12.546
I can have a drink
during the day.

59:12.578 --> 59:15.948
Lapse in judgment giving him some.
I'll give you that.

59:15.981 --> 59:17.450
Anyway, Alec came to me
after a session.

59:17.483 --> 59:21.620
He said he needed a ride home. I offered
him one. I told him I'd take him.

59:21.654 --> 59:23.289
I went to what I thought was
his house, but he was confused.

59:23.322 --> 59:24.890
- Probably 'cause he's drunk.
- He's not drunk.

59:24.924 --> 59:28.694
We went just like ninjas and beat the
crap out of these two kids who bully me

59:28.727 --> 59:30.963
- and then played baseball.
- Okay, that's enough, Alec.

59:32.131 --> 59:34.934
Millie, that's not why
I came here, okay?

59:34.967 --> 59:35.935
I really got to tell you
something.

59:35.968 --> 59:37.369
What is it? Because I'm still
a little hung up

59:37.403 --> 59:38.604
on you getting a 9-year-old
drunk.

59:38.637 --> 59:41.874
We're not drunk, just warm,
that's what my dad always says.

59:47.346 --> 59:49.882
Gabe, what?
Why are you here?

59:49.915 --> 59:55.321
I, um, I... I... I just really
need your help, okay?

59:55.354 --> 59:56.590
We got to find out
where he lives,

59:56.622 --> 59:59.959
find out where his parents are
so we can return him home, okay?

59:59.992 --> 01:00:02.228
We?
Now all of a sudden we're a we?

01:00:02.261 --> 01:00:05.798
Yes, we.
I need your help, okay?

01:00:09.468 --> 01:00:12.037
Fine, let me get my purse.

01:00:12.071 --> 01:00:13.706
We'll get you home, okay?
Don't worry.

01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:29.755
Gabe.

01:00:31.223 --> 01:00:32.258
What's this for?

01:00:32.291 --> 01:00:34.093
Support.
It's what my friends do.

01:00:35.728 --> 01:00:37.796
Oh, and I also got to tell you
something.

01:00:37.830 --> 01:00:39.031
What?

01:00:41.433 --> 01:00:42.602
Cause and effect.

01:00:42.636 --> 01:00:47.139
You told a lie, so I hit you,
so you wouldn't lie again.

01:00:51.277 --> 01:00:53.379
It's pretty good.
It's pretty good.

01:00:55.915 --> 01:00:59.285
My therapist says
hitting when I'm mad is bad.

01:00:59.318 --> 01:01:00.286
Well, she's right.

01:01:01.187 --> 01:01:03.355
Doing anything when you're mad
is wrong.

01:01:04.023 --> 01:01:05.457
What... what are you mad about
anyway?

01:01:05.491 --> 01:01:07.993
You're young, you got a
whole life ahead of you.

01:01:08.894 --> 01:01:10.829
Getting mad comes later
in your 30s.

01:01:11.330 --> 01:01:12.798
Today something happened.

01:01:13.299 --> 01:01:15.701
What?
What happened at school today?

01:01:17.002 --> 01:01:21.173
So, you know, how there are
three kids who are bullying me?

01:01:21.207 --> 01:01:23.442
Yeah, we got revenge
on two of them at the park.

01:01:25.545 --> 01:01:26.912
So, there's a third.

01:01:28.447 --> 01:01:30.015
Okay, so.

01:01:31.917 --> 01:01:32.918
I burned him.

01:01:35.821 --> 01:01:37.323
I lit him on fire
in the bathroom.

01:01:39.024 --> 01:01:43.796
This was just a small one,
to make him sweat a little.

01:01:43.829 --> 01:01:46.365
I've been telling the teachers
that Jason was a bully.

01:01:46.398 --> 01:01:48.834
They just said,
"Kids will be kids."

01:01:48.867 --> 01:01:50.336
And you gotta stand up
to bullies.

01:01:51.036 --> 01:01:52.938
That's what the commercials
always say.

01:01:55.174 --> 01:01:57.376
So, I took a lighter
from my mom's purse,

01:01:58.310 --> 01:02:00.346
put a little lighter fluid
from our garage

01:02:00.379 --> 01:02:01.947
in this little syringe

01:02:01.981 --> 01:02:04.984
that my mom used to
flush wax out of her ears.

01:02:08.087 --> 01:02:13.959
Then followed him to the
bathroom and wet his new shoes,

01:02:15.861 --> 01:02:18.864
then lit him on fire.

01:02:22.835 --> 01:02:25.137
Is the kid... is the kid dead?

01:02:25.170 --> 01:02:29.542
No.
It just got up to his knees.

01:02:29.576 --> 01:02:31.343
It was funny though.

01:02:31.377 --> 01:02:32.778
He was running around
like a little girl.

01:02:34.213 --> 01:02:37.416
My girlfriend Sarah saw him run out
of the bathroom and down the hall.

01:02:39.118 --> 01:02:43.222
Then I just smiled at her and then
just went back to the cafeteria

01:02:43.255 --> 01:02:44.890
and started eating my lunch.

01:02:45.491 --> 01:02:47.393
Sometimes things just
had to be burned.

01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:50.095
Okay, you guys ready?

01:02:52.331 --> 01:02:53.866
Hey, what color are your gums?

01:02:55.568 --> 01:02:57.036
All right. Let's get me home.

01:03:05.344 --> 01:03:07.346
Does any of this look
familiar to you, Alec?

01:03:08.013 --> 01:03:11.450
I mean do you live by any, um...
any big landmarks or?

01:03:11.483 --> 01:03:14.019
- Oh, yeah. I am actually.
- Oh, that's great!

01:03:14.053 --> 01:03:15.487
Which one?

01:03:15.521 --> 01:03:17.890
Um, there's a donut shop
around the corner.

01:03:18.490 --> 01:03:20.893
Dude, there are a thousand
donut shops in L.A.

01:03:20.926 --> 01:03:22.194
Oh, I found a good
one up on Vermont.

01:03:22.227 --> 01:03:23.195
It's so good.

01:03:26.265 --> 01:03:28.133
My phone's about to go dead,
you have your charger on you?

01:03:28.167 --> 01:03:29.234
This is your car, Gabe.

01:03:29.268 --> 01:03:30.502
Why would I have
a phone charger?

01:03:30.537 --> 01:03:31.870
You could just say no.

01:03:31.904 --> 01:03:33.472
That would be
way more efficient.

01:03:33.505 --> 01:03:35.575
Okay, you know what?
You can just...

01:03:35.608 --> 01:03:36.842
All right,
I'm gonna swing by the gym,

01:03:36.875 --> 01:03:39.546
I got an extra charger there.
It's right around the corner.

01:03:54.293 --> 01:03:56.161
- Ah, Gabe.
- Hey, man.

01:03:56.195 --> 01:03:58.631
Congrats, bro. Listen,
I want to hear all about it,

01:03:58.665 --> 01:04:00.633
but I got a new client
coming up.

01:04:00.667 --> 01:04:01.934
- Okay.
- All right.

01:04:03.435 --> 01:04:07.239
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Heard the news,
so awesome bro. I didn't even know.

01:04:07.272 --> 01:04:08.240
What are you talking about?

01:04:08.273 --> 01:04:10.376
Dude, your fiancée just told us
the good news.

01:04:10.409 --> 01:04:13.045
You're getting married
and having a baby!

01:04:13.078 --> 01:04:14.079
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Yo, I better be invited

01:04:14.113 --> 01:04:15.715
- to the wedding.
- My fiancée?

01:04:15.749 --> 01:04:19.284
Yeah, she's inside, showing everybody
your baby picture and her baby picture,

01:04:19.318 --> 01:04:21.253
trying to figure out
what the baby's gonna look like.

01:04:26.091 --> 01:04:28.193
Can you get me
a blue baby stroller?

01:04:28.227 --> 01:04:30.396
- That's really what I need.
- Uh, Bailey. What are you doing?

01:04:30.429 --> 01:04:31.631
Oh, hey, baby.

01:04:31.664 --> 01:04:34.701
I'm just on the internet looking
for strollers for the baby.

01:04:34.734 --> 01:04:37.336
Oh, can you believe some of
them come with three wheels?

01:04:37.369 --> 01:04:38.904
Yeah, can I talk to you outside
for a second?

01:04:39.505 --> 01:04:41.574
- Can it wait?
- No, it cannot wait.

01:04:41.608 --> 01:04:45.444
Okay, and they say we get
hormonal when we're pregnant.

01:04:45.477 --> 01:04:47.614
It was so nice
meeting you, you guys.

01:04:47.647 --> 01:04:49.181
Oh, okay.
What are you doing?

01:04:49.214 --> 01:04:50.683
Why are you grabbing me
like that?

01:04:50.717 --> 01:04:52.484
What are you doing, huh?

01:04:52.518 --> 01:04:54.153
You can't just come up
to my job like that

01:04:54.186 --> 01:04:55.454
telling everybody my business.

01:04:55.487 --> 01:04:57.690
You're about to be a father,
Gabe.

01:04:57.724 --> 01:05:00.325
You need to get that idea wrapped
around your head, sweetheart.

01:05:00.359 --> 01:05:03.295
And those colleagues of yours
need to know what's going on

01:05:03.328 --> 01:05:06.298
because I'm not gonna be at home
raising a baby by my damn self.

01:05:06.331 --> 01:05:09.001
So you might have to start hiring some
more people around here or something.

01:05:09.034 --> 01:05:09.702
Listen, Bailey!

01:05:10.537 --> 01:05:13.405
How do I even know it's mine?
Hmm?

01:05:15.608 --> 01:05:18.310
Are you?
Are you calling me a whore?

01:05:18.343 --> 01:05:20.479
- No.
- Are you calling me a whore?

01:05:20.512 --> 01:05:25.017
No, but I'm saying, I don't talk
to you for like two months, right?

01:05:25.050 --> 01:05:26.686
I tell you I got a girlfriend
and all of a sudden...

01:05:26.719 --> 01:05:27.620
- Wow.
- ...you show up

01:05:27.654 --> 01:05:30.489
and you're pregnant.
I'm just... come on!

01:05:31.323 --> 01:05:32.391
Who's that chick?

01:05:33.492 --> 01:05:35.060
Oh, she's Bailey.

01:05:35.595 --> 01:05:37.362
How do you know who Bailey is?

01:05:37.396 --> 01:05:39.064
I met her at Gabe's house.

01:05:40.399 --> 01:05:42.501
She and Gabe are going to have
a baby together...

01:05:43.536 --> 01:05:44.737
What did you just say?

01:05:44.771 --> 01:05:47.039
Just sticking your
thing wherever you feel like it

01:05:47.072 --> 01:05:48.741
but when it comes
to responsibility,

01:05:48.775 --> 01:05:51.611
you can't handle the heat.
So, what?

01:05:52.612 --> 01:05:54.046
I guess I'm just supposed to
just start

01:05:54.079 --> 01:05:55.615
tricking on the street now, huh?

01:05:55.648 --> 01:05:59.586
Just sucking dick to put Gabe Jr. through
private school. Is that what you want?

01:05:59.619 --> 01:06:03.121
You want me to start sucking
dick for our son's school, Gabe?

01:06:03.155 --> 01:06:04.657
- Oh, my God.
- What kind of father are you?

01:06:04.691 --> 01:06:06.225
Look, Bailey,
I'm not about to have

01:06:06.258 --> 01:06:07.760
this dumbass conversation
with you.

01:06:07.794 --> 01:06:09.696
Not here.
Can you please just go?

01:06:10.429 --> 01:06:11.997
- Please.
- Is it?

01:06:12.464 --> 01:06:13.465
Is that Millie?

01:06:13.499 --> 01:06:15.033
He wasn't happy about it.

01:06:16.268 --> 01:06:18.638
That's why we came to your house
and Gabe got you a card.

01:06:20.105 --> 01:06:22.307
I am begging you,
will you please leave.

01:06:22.341 --> 01:06:23.242
- Oh, my God!
- Right now is not the time.

01:06:23.275 --> 01:06:24.744
You brought her here?

01:06:24.777 --> 01:06:27.346
- Really?
- Look, babe, babe.

01:06:27.379 --> 01:06:29.549
Wow. I can't believe you
right now.

01:06:29.582 --> 01:06:31.651
Babe, we'll figure it out.

01:06:32.451 --> 01:06:33.586
We'll talk about it later.

01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:35.153
We'll figure it out, but could
you please just go now.

01:06:35.187 --> 01:06:36.789
Please, for me.

01:06:36.823 --> 01:06:38.123
Could you do that
for me, please?

01:06:38.591 --> 01:06:39.559
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:06:40.727 --> 01:06:43.095
But you better tell that bitch
what it is, Gabe.

01:06:43.128 --> 01:06:44.731
- Okay, I will.
- Because I don't want her

01:06:44.764 --> 01:06:46.265
- wrecking our home.
- All right.

01:06:46.298 --> 01:06:47.266
- Okay?
- Okay. I understand.

01:06:47.299 --> 01:06:50.537
And on the real,
if I wasn't carrying our child,

01:06:50.570 --> 01:06:52.404
- I would whoop that ass.
- I understand.

01:06:52.437 --> 01:06:53.540
- Tell her what I said.
- I will.

01:06:53.573 --> 01:06:54.506
I'll call you later
or something.

01:06:54.541 --> 01:06:56.375
Or something?
Gabe, don't get it twisted.

01:06:56.408 --> 01:06:57.844
I'm gonna start needing some
money soon

01:06:57.877 --> 01:07:01.548
'cause I'm starting maternity
leave any minute now, okay?

01:07:01.581 --> 01:07:03.081
All right. Okay.

01:07:03.115 --> 01:07:04.017
Give me a kiss.

01:07:04.049 --> 01:07:05.618
I'll kiss you later.
I'll kiss you later.

01:07:12.190 --> 01:07:13.560
Gabe, who's that?

01:07:13.593 --> 01:07:15.193
- It's just this...
- Is she pregnant?

01:07:16.428 --> 01:07:18.230
It's not what it looks like.
I promise.

01:07:20.833 --> 01:07:22.234
Vroom, vroom, vroom.

01:07:23.636 --> 01:07:25.470
Hey, good to see you, man.

01:07:26.806 --> 01:07:28.875
Patrick, did I miss a session
or something?

01:07:28.908 --> 01:07:30.475
What are you doing... what are
you doing here with Mark?

01:07:31.410 --> 01:07:32.277
Hey, Gabe. Um...

01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:35.715
Look it... it just really
wasn't working out

01:07:35.748 --> 01:07:38.651
with you training me,
so I got a new guy.

01:07:40.252 --> 01:07:41.153
This is Mark.

01:07:41.186 --> 01:07:43.355
Hey, did you hear
Gabe's having a baby?

01:07:44.456 --> 01:07:45.490
Congratulations!

01:07:46.325 --> 01:07:47.392
What's with those bands?

01:07:47.426 --> 01:07:48.728
- Let's get in.
- Come on.

01:07:50.228 --> 01:07:51.296
Is that Millie?

01:07:51.864 --> 01:07:55.167
Hey, you look amazing!

01:07:56.101 --> 01:07:57.604
What are you...
what are you doing here?

01:07:58.805 --> 01:07:59.906
Uh...

01:07:59.939 --> 01:08:03.408
I actually have no idea what
I'm doing here.

01:08:04.677 --> 01:08:05.745
Do you have plans right now?

01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:08.681
I... I got something I've been
dying to talk to you about.

01:08:08.715 --> 01:08:11.149
Let's... let's get some food,
we'll get a drink.

01:08:11.183 --> 01:08:12.585
I'll... I'll tell
you all about it.

01:08:14.219 --> 01:08:16.421
Yeah. Yeah, I could use a drink.

01:08:16.455 --> 01:08:18.591
Great.
Hey, Mark, I'm really sorry.

01:08:18.625 --> 01:08:21.527
I... I'm... I'm gonna have
to reschedule, okay. Um...

01:08:21.894 --> 01:08:23.696
- This is important.
- Got you.

01:08:23.729 --> 01:08:26.231
Yeah. I already, already
prepaid the ten, right?

01:08:26.264 --> 01:08:27.366
- You're good.
- I'll see you again.

01:08:27.399 --> 01:08:28.635
- Gotcha.
- Thanks.

01:08:30.234 --> 01:08:31.269
- Grab your stuff.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

01:08:31.303 --> 01:08:32.203
Okay.

01:08:43.448 --> 01:08:44.917
Well, this is embarrassing.

01:08:44.951 --> 01:08:46.318
This is why
I never drive myself.

01:08:47.953 --> 01:08:49.656
Gabe, do you have a car?

01:08:50.322 --> 01:08:52.457
Would you give me and Millie
a ride to my house?

01:08:52.491 --> 01:08:55.426
Yeah, Gabe.
Could you do that for Patrick and I?

01:08:57.729 --> 01:08:59.264
I'd really appreciate it.

01:09:03.335 --> 01:09:07.406
Hi, um, hey,
who, who's this kid?

01:09:09.408 --> 01:09:13.779
I'm... Wait. Who am I?

01:09:15.279 --> 01:09:17.215
Well, you're Patty Nelson.

01:09:17.249 --> 01:09:19.384
You're like the best
guitarist ever.

01:09:19.417 --> 01:09:21.754
Well, thanks.
I'm flattered you think so.

01:09:22.421 --> 01:09:24.991
Alec. That's my name. Alec.

01:09:25.024 --> 01:09:26.526
Right on, Alec.

01:09:26.559 --> 01:09:31.863
Hey, um, maybe it's best if you turn
around and face front. Might be safer.

01:09:31.898 --> 01:09:35.667
My parents make me sleep with the
door open. They think that's safer.

01:09:35.702 --> 01:09:36.935
He's going through some changes.

01:09:36.969 --> 01:09:40.238
Yeah, but I'm in therapy because
I burned the kid at school.

01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:41.808
You burned a kid?

01:09:41.841 --> 01:09:43.442
Okay, Alec, turn around.

01:09:43.475 --> 01:09:45.277
That's Patty Nelson, the legend.

01:09:45.310 --> 01:09:47.680
I know. Just turn around.
Just right now, turn around.

01:09:53.417 --> 01:09:55.320
- Why?
- Alec, stop!

01:09:55.353 --> 01:09:57.623
Alec, calm down!
Alec, calm down.

01:09:57.657 --> 01:09:59.357
Calm down.
We already did this, bro.

01:09:59.391 --> 01:10:01.627
We're not doing this again,
okay? Stop.

01:10:02.662 --> 01:10:05.765
Can I ride the rest of the ride
looking at Mr. Nelson now?

01:10:07.332 --> 01:10:08.400
I'd rather you didn't.

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:18.878
So, Gabe, did I hear correctly,
you're gonna have a baby?

01:10:18.911 --> 01:10:21.848
Yeah, Gabe, did we hear that correctly,
you are going to have a baby?

01:10:21.881 --> 01:10:24.016
It's a little more complicated
than that I suppose.

01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:27.553
What exactly is so complicated?
I mean, sex is pretty simple.

01:10:27.587 --> 01:10:30.455
I mean, you insert A into B, you
drop a load off and then boom,

01:10:30.489 --> 01:10:31.858
nine months later
you have a baby.

01:10:31.891 --> 01:10:33.860
- What's so complicated?
- No, maybe,

01:10:33.893 --> 01:10:35.862
maybe right now
is not the best time.

01:10:35.895 --> 01:10:38.396
Oh, it isn't? It's not
convenient for you, Gabe?

01:10:38.430 --> 01:10:40.733
What are you gonna save it all for
your next little therapy session?

01:10:40.767 --> 01:10:43.536
I mean, you are unbelievable.

01:10:43.569 --> 01:10:45.605
You can open up to every person
on this planet except for me,

01:10:45.638 --> 01:10:47.372
but you know what, actually,
it's fine.

01:10:47.405 --> 01:10:48.775
Maybe you can explain
to Dr. Jones

01:10:48.808 --> 01:10:50.676
how someone who's too afraid
to be in a healthy

01:10:50.710 --> 01:10:52.678
and loving,
committed relationship,

01:10:52.712 --> 01:10:55.313
thinks it's a better idea to
knock up a random chick instead.

01:10:55.347 --> 01:10:57.583
I mean that'll be, ooh, that'll be a great session..

01:10:57.617 --> 01:10:59.552
Guys, this, uh,
kid is freaking me out.

01:10:59.585 --> 01:11:01.888
I don't think he's blinked the
entire time he's been staring at me.

01:11:01.921 --> 01:11:02.889
Actually, you know what,
it's good.

01:11:02.922 --> 01:11:05.858
Alec should hear all about
his new best friend.

01:11:05.892 --> 01:11:07.527
That way he can grow up
to be just like him.

01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:10.029
Look, no, everybody listen,
if we could just...

01:11:10.062 --> 01:11:13.866
We get Patrick home, then we'll
find out a way to get Alec home.

01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:15.467
I say we drop
the good son off first.

01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:17.469
I'll explain all this
later, babe. I promise.

01:11:17.502 --> 01:11:19.872
We, there you go again
with the "we" stuff.

01:11:19.906 --> 01:11:22.642
We didn't raw dog the squat-legged
chick back there in the leggings,

01:11:22.675 --> 01:11:23.709
the one you got pregnant.

01:11:23.743 --> 01:11:25.978
Oh, dude.
You got to wear protection.

01:11:26.012 --> 01:11:28.681
There's diseases out here that'll
make your junk fall right off.

01:11:28.714 --> 01:11:30.482
My mom calls it
the willy.

01:11:30.515 --> 01:11:33.886
Got me out here making chicken
tacos, trying to hang out again?

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:35.822
And this whole time
you've got a chick pregnant?

01:11:35.855 --> 01:11:37.322
- And you weren't gonna tell me.
- She does not...

01:11:37.355 --> 01:11:38.456
- I don't even know if it's mine.
- You didn't think I'll find out?

01:11:38.490 --> 01:11:41.127
- Unreal.
- <i>How does that make you feel?</i>

01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:43.029
<i>How does that make you feel?</i>

01:11:43.062 --> 01:11:45.932
<i>How does that make you feel?</i>

01:11:45.965 --> 01:11:47.432
- <i>How does that make you feel?</i>
- Gabe.

01:11:47.465 --> 01:11:48.701
Gabe! Where you going?

01:11:56.042 --> 01:11:59.411
Gabe! Gabe! You're being
ridiculous, get in the car.

01:11:59.444 --> 01:12:01.379
I can't get in the car.
I can't get in.

01:12:01.848 --> 01:12:03.950
Why not? It's your car.
We can take you wherever you want to go.

01:12:03.983 --> 01:12:07.720
If I get... If I get back
in the car, I'll kill you all.

01:12:07.753 --> 01:12:09.387
Okay, you're not going
to kill anybody.

01:12:09.421 --> 01:12:11.657
You're just having another one
of your anxiety attacks.

01:12:11.691 --> 01:12:13.593
Nope, nope. This was real.

01:12:13.626 --> 01:12:14.760
I'll kill you all
if I get back in the car.

01:12:14.794 --> 01:12:17.096
- Gabe. Gabe, get in the car.
- No, I can't.

01:12:17.129 --> 01:12:19.397
Gabe! Gabe!

01:12:19.431 --> 01:12:20.733
Where the fuck is he going?

01:12:32.578 --> 01:12:33.813
What a day!

01:12:35.681 --> 01:12:39.085
You know, Gabe was pretty upset
when he heard he was gonna be a dad.

01:12:41.621 --> 01:12:42.755
What'd he say?

01:12:43.990 --> 01:12:47.593
He said she was like a whiskey
mistake or something like that.

01:12:49.829 --> 01:12:52.131
Yeah, pretty sure.

01:12:52.164 --> 01:12:53.532
I know where he's going.

01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:58.838
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm. Wednesday, right?

01:13:13.518 --> 01:13:16.856
- Gabe. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:13:18.224 --> 01:13:20.026
Is someone chasing you
or something?

01:13:20.059 --> 01:13:21.894
No, no. I'm fine, I just...

01:13:21.928 --> 01:13:23.029
Are you, are you hurt?

01:13:23.062 --> 01:13:24.830
Oh, it's just...
I just can't breathe.

01:13:24.864 --> 01:13:26.032
All right, here, here, here.

01:13:26.065 --> 01:13:27.033
Drink this.

01:13:30.569 --> 01:13:32.204
You don't look... You know what,
I'm going to call somebody.

01:13:32.238 --> 01:13:33.940
No, no.
I'm fine.

01:13:33.973 --> 01:13:35.741
I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:13:36.842 --> 01:13:37.910
I just can't breathe.

01:13:39.378 --> 01:13:41.714
Okay, look, just, everything's going
to be fine. Just take a breath.

01:13:44.984 --> 01:13:48.955
Look, this day has to be
the worst day of my life.

01:13:51.523 --> 01:13:52.558
Okay, just tell me
what happened.

01:13:53.693 --> 01:13:56.729
Okay, well, first of all, right,
I run away from my car.

01:13:56.762 --> 01:14:00.733
I leave my, my ex, Millie,
with her ex-fiancé Patty Nelson.

01:14:00.766 --> 01:14:01.867
I love that guy.

01:14:01.901 --> 01:14:03.269
Yeah, and then, and then
I'd be riding around all day

01:14:03.302 --> 01:14:07.807
with some, some kid who just
might be the next Hannibal Lecter.

01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:10.910
Oh, oh, and I,
I'm about to be a father.

01:14:11.711 --> 01:14:14.814
Yeah, yeah.
I got some random chick pregnant.

01:14:14.847 --> 01:14:17.817
I don't even like her.
She shows up to my job.

01:14:17.850 --> 01:14:20.086
I messed with her like
a couple of months ago.

01:14:20.119 --> 01:14:24.757
She's pregnant. She's keeping 'em and,
yeah, it's just, it's just all bad.

01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:26.158
Okay, just take a,
take a second.

01:14:26.192 --> 01:14:27.827
Hang on a minute.
Just, just take a breath.

01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:29.695
Everything's gonna be all right.
You're gonna be fine.

01:14:29.729 --> 01:14:32.031
No, no. I'm not gonna be fine.

01:14:32.064 --> 01:14:34.767
You keep saying that shit
and it's not true.

01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:38.104
Okay? It just keeps getting worse
and worse. Everything sucks.

01:14:42.008 --> 01:14:45.277
I'm not ready to be a father,
man, not like this with her.

01:14:48.014 --> 01:14:53.052
I love Millie and I was really,
really trying to make it work

01:14:53.085 --> 01:14:54.887
and this fucking thing happens.

01:14:55.721 --> 01:14:58.624
Who's this kid that
you were hanging out with?

01:14:58.657 --> 01:15:01.727
It's Alec. He's some kid who goes
to therapy in the building somewhere.

01:15:05.297 --> 01:15:06.766
Oh, God!

01:15:06.799 --> 01:15:08.601
- Oh, God!
- Why? Why?

01:15:08.634 --> 01:15:09.902
- What?
- Everybody, everybody,

01:15:09.935 --> 01:15:12.104
everybody has been looking
for him.

01:15:12.138 --> 01:15:13.739
- What?
- Yeah.

01:15:13.773 --> 01:15:15.307
He didn't show up
for his session today,

01:15:15.341 --> 01:15:17.109
so they've been looking all over
for him.

01:15:18.244 --> 01:15:19.745
He's not missing,
he's in the car.

01:15:19.779 --> 01:15:20.880
All right, Gabe, listen.
I need...

01:15:20.913 --> 01:15:22.214
That motherfucker.

01:15:22.248 --> 01:15:26.719
I need you to, to bring him
upstairs, so I can, I can see him.

01:15:26.752 --> 01:15:28.754
- Not that you would do anything.
- There's nothing wrong with him.

01:15:28.788 --> 01:15:29.889
There's nothing wrong
with him, okay?

01:15:29.922 --> 01:15:31.690
Except he burns little kids
at school.

01:15:31.724 --> 01:15:34.693
I need to protect the safety
of this child. Can you please

01:15:34.727 --> 01:15:36.195
- bring him up to here?
- Safety? He's fine.

01:15:36.228 --> 01:15:38.197
- He's fine. He's fucking fine.
- Okay.

01:15:57.383 --> 01:15:59.218
- Gabe. Gabe.
- Come here. Come here.

01:15:59.251 --> 01:16:00.252
Gabe, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Easy, easy.

01:16:00.286 --> 01:16:02.054
- Come here.
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:16:02.088 --> 01:16:03.189
You've been lying to me.

01:16:04.190 --> 01:16:05.458
You said your grandmother forgot
to pick you up

01:16:05.491 --> 01:16:08.894
because she's old after your session.
But you never went.

01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:13.032
Right. Right.

01:16:13.065 --> 01:16:15.801
And then you took me on this
wild-ass goose chase

01:16:15.835 --> 01:16:18.237
pretending you were locked out,
stealing candy and shit.

01:16:18.270 --> 01:16:20.739
You got people thinking
you're fucking kidnapped.

01:16:20.773 --> 01:16:22.942
I never should have picked
your ass up in the first place.

01:16:22.975 --> 01:16:24.043
Well, Gabe, Gabe,
I think that's enough.

01:16:24.076 --> 01:16:25.611
Oh, what do you care, huh?

01:16:26.879 --> 01:16:29.348
Right, you're leaving me anyway
without even hearing my side,

01:16:29.381 --> 01:16:31.951
so you don't have to worry about
what I do anymore.

01:16:31.984 --> 01:16:34.653
Now, listen, you're gonna
tell me where you live.

01:16:34.687 --> 01:16:36.322
You're gonna tell me
what's going on.

01:16:36.355 --> 01:16:38.791
You're gonna tell me right now.
I'm not playing anymore.

01:16:38.824 --> 01:16:43.229
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
I told a fib earlier. I'm sorry.

01:16:43.262 --> 01:16:47.199
I know where I live.
I just didn't want to go back to my house.

01:16:47.233 --> 01:16:49.802
My dad will keep
ruffling my hair,

01:16:49.835 --> 01:16:52.271
my mom would keep looking at me
like she's about to cry.

01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:56.208
They don't know me.

01:16:57.443 --> 01:17:01.380
I just want to hang out with you.
You're my only friend.

01:17:02.081 --> 01:17:04.950
I just didn't want to go back
to my house, that's all.

01:17:04.984 --> 01:17:06.018
I would like to go home.

01:17:06.051 --> 01:17:07.653
Dude, shut the fuck up, Patrick.

01:17:08.787 --> 01:17:10.956
Listen, it's okay, man.
It's okay.

01:17:12.358 --> 01:17:15.361
We just got to get you home,
man. We got to do that, okay?

01:17:15.394 --> 01:17:16.896
Maybe I could work
something out,

01:17:16.929 --> 01:17:18.230
if you start playing baseball,
I could,

01:17:18.264 --> 01:17:19.965
I could come to your game
or something.

01:17:20.432 --> 01:17:22.868
You're my pal still.
You're my pal.

01:17:24.003 --> 01:17:26.939
- Okay, promise?
- I promise.

01:17:38.350 --> 01:17:41.320
I live at
11204 Sycamore Boulevard.

01:17:53.999 --> 01:17:55.267
Hey, man.

01:17:55.968 --> 01:17:57.970
I'm sorry for that stuff I said
back there.

01:17:58.003 --> 01:18:00.773
I, I didn't mean anything.
You didn't deserve it.

01:18:00.806 --> 01:18:03.475
It's okay.
You are having a bad day.

01:18:07.146 --> 01:18:08.347
I'm sorry, too.

01:18:10.416 --> 01:18:11.283
I know.

01:18:12.384 --> 01:18:13.752
Can we please talk later?

01:18:16.556 --> 01:18:18.157
I think this is it.

01:18:25.264 --> 01:18:27.466
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm just...

01:18:27.499 --> 01:18:29.902
You guys are probably looking
for Alec, so, I just...

01:18:30.369 --> 01:18:31.770
All right. Hey, freeze! Let me
see your hands right now!

01:18:31.804 --> 01:18:33.005
- Hands! Let me see 'em.
- Who?

01:18:33.038 --> 01:18:34.373
- You. Put your hands up?
- Okay.

01:18:34.406 --> 01:18:35.609
- Do not put them down.
- Okay.

01:18:35.642 --> 01:18:36.976
- What the fuck is happening?
- Get on the car. Get on the car.

01:18:37.009 --> 01:18:37.776
- What are you'll doing?
- What are you arresting him for?

01:18:37.810 --> 01:18:40.145
Son, everything's okay.
All right?

01:18:40.179 --> 01:18:41.947
- You're safe.
- I've been safe. Gabe is my friend. No.

01:18:41.981 --> 01:18:43.282
Okay, wait,
why are you arresting him?

01:18:43.315 --> 01:18:45.451
- I need you people to back up?
- You break my fucking arm,

01:18:45.484 --> 01:18:46.385
- I'm gonna beat that ass...
- Stop resisting.

01:18:46.418 --> 01:18:47.886
I'm not resisting.

01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:49.321
Guys, this is a
misunderstanding.

01:18:49.355 --> 01:18:51.123
- I'm not gonna tell you again.
- Don't talk to her like that.

01:18:51.156 --> 01:18:52.858
- Hey, shut up. Come on.
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

01:18:52.891 --> 01:18:54.159
- Officer. Officer.
- This is a mistake.

01:18:54.193 --> 01:18:55.127
- He's my friend!
- Where are you taking him?

01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:56.795
He's not the bad guy.

01:18:56.829 --> 01:18:59.131
Alec. Oh, my God, honey!

01:18:59.164 --> 01:19:01.166
Honey, are you okay?
We've been worried sick.

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:03.435
That, that man,
he didn't touch you anywhere, did he?

01:19:03.469 --> 01:19:05.371
Tell them to let him go, dad,
tell them.

01:19:05.404 --> 01:19:08.207
Yeah, let the police do their job.
They're the heroes today, chief.

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:09.576
- Hi, hi. You're his parents?
- Hi.

01:19:09.609 --> 01:19:11.477
I'm Millie.
I'm Gabe's girlfriend.

01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:14.380
I think this whole thing is a
huge misunderstanding.

01:19:14.413 --> 01:19:17.916
Gabe would never hurt Alec,
they're friends.

01:19:17.950 --> 01:19:20.286
Friends? No, a man in his 30s
and my child

01:19:20.319 --> 01:19:24.156
don't need to be friends. There's no
misunderstanding. Your boyfriend kidnapped my son.

01:19:24.189 --> 01:19:25.524
- Okay, I...
- Okay, we've been worried sick.

01:19:25.558 --> 01:19:27.860
Oh, my word! Oh, my word!

01:19:27.893 --> 01:19:29.529
It's Patty Nelson.
You're Patty Nelson.

01:19:29.562 --> 01:19:31.030
Nelson, can I get
your autograph?

01:19:31.063 --> 01:19:32.164
My friends at work are never
gonna believe this.

01:19:32.197 --> 01:19:34.967
- Give me something to write on.
- It's not the best time.

01:19:35.535 --> 01:19:37.436
And, and who do you think
you are?

01:19:37.469 --> 01:19:40.306
What kind of grown man hangs out
with a 9-year-old all day?

01:19:40.339 --> 01:19:41.574
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

01:19:41.608 --> 01:19:44.310
Ashamed? What?
You don't even know your son.

01:19:44.343 --> 01:19:46.412
You know, he doesn't even
like hamburgers, stupid.

01:19:46.445 --> 01:19:48.013
- Come on.
- Gabe, hang in there, okay.

01:19:48.047 --> 01:19:49.248
We're going to, we're going to
get you out of this.

01:19:49.281 --> 01:19:50.583
Patrick has plenty of money.
We're going to figure this out.

01:19:50.617 --> 01:19:52.518
Yeah, yeah. No.
Anybody's money but his.

01:19:52.552 --> 01:19:54.353
- Anybody's but his.
- Hey, shut up!

01:19:54.386 --> 01:19:56.355
- Patrick Nelson is the best.
- Get in the car.

01:19:56.388 --> 01:19:58.824
- Fuck Patty Nelson.
- Get in the car.

01:19:59.291 --> 01:20:00.527
Ma'am, let's get you inside.

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:02.094
You and your family don't need
to see this.

01:20:03.596 --> 01:20:06.098
- Everything all right?
- Uh, yeah. We're getting there. So, what happened?

01:20:06.533 --> 01:20:08.300
Are you involved
in this kidnapping?

01:20:08.334 --> 01:20:10.102
I mean, I know you're not,
but you're his girlfriend.

01:20:10.135 --> 01:20:11.437
What do you know about this?

01:20:11.470 --> 01:20:12.672
What do you mean what do I...

01:20:12.706 --> 01:20:15.608
Alec needed a ride home from
therapy today, so Gabe took him.

01:20:15.642 --> 01:20:18.277
Therapy?
Why does your boy need therapy?

01:20:19.478 --> 01:20:22.214
He's, he's got some
behavioral issues.

01:20:22.247 --> 01:20:24.350
He's just figuring out
who he is.

01:20:24.383 --> 01:20:28.887
Um, and that monster must have
grabbed him after Alec's session.

01:20:28.921 --> 01:20:31.256
Today he's had a particularly
rough day at school.

01:20:31.290 --> 01:20:33.926
He's probably emotional
and, you know,

01:20:33.959 --> 01:20:35.327
that, that man
took advantage of it.

01:20:36.061 --> 01:20:37.564
What happened with
Alec at school?

01:20:39.064 --> 01:20:42.134
In a roundabout way, he was the cause
of an accident to another student.

01:20:42.167 --> 01:20:45.237
Alec burned a kid for bullying him.
That's what happened.

01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:51.143
Did this, uh, did this happen
at Burroughs Grade School?

01:20:51.644 --> 01:20:52.878
Yeah, why?

01:20:54.714 --> 01:20:57.149
Oh, my God! You little fucker!

01:20:57.182 --> 01:20:58.183
- You little fucker!
- Joe, Joe, Joe.

01:20:58.217 --> 01:21:00.620
My son Jason has second-degree
burns on his legs.

01:21:00.653 --> 01:21:02.354
He's in a wheelchair
because of you.

01:21:02.388 --> 01:21:04.022
- You fucking psychopath!
- Okay, Joe.

01:21:04.056 --> 01:21:06.526
He gets to ride in a wheelchair?
Cool!

01:21:06.559 --> 01:21:08.193
Cool, cool?

01:21:08.227 --> 01:21:10.530
Cool? I'm going to kill you,
you little fucker!

01:21:10.563 --> 01:21:13.198
Your fucking kid's a psychopath.
That's what he is.

01:21:13.232 --> 01:21:15.234
You take that back!
Randy, do something.

01:21:15.267 --> 01:21:16.969
- Huh?
- Okay, look, look, look.

01:21:17.002 --> 01:21:18.705
Now we're all going to
forgive Detective Parlow.

01:21:18.738 --> 01:21:20.172
Detective Parlow here
is a little emotional.

01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:23.308
Either they don't know,
don't show,

01:21:24.309 --> 01:21:26.145
or don't care about
what's going on in the hood.

01:21:27.714 --> 01:21:30.282
Do not quote "Boys in the Hood"
to me right now.

01:21:30.315 --> 01:21:31.283
Boy, you got to breathe.

01:21:32.084 --> 01:21:32.985
You got two strikes.

01:21:33.018 --> 01:21:33.986
Look, two life-changing moments

01:21:34.019 --> 01:21:35.421
where you taught me
that I'll never forget.

01:21:35.454 --> 01:21:38.625
One, watching that movie.
Ricky should have never stopped to pee.

01:21:38.658 --> 01:21:40.292
It was right around the corner
from his house.

01:21:41.059 --> 01:21:43.630
And, two,
nothing should be forced.

01:21:44.597 --> 01:21:46.699
Nothing. I like Gabe.

01:21:46.733 --> 01:21:49.702
He, he's a real nice guy
but he's a mess.

01:21:49.736 --> 01:21:50.770
Patrick, maybe you're right.

01:21:50.804 --> 01:21:55.274
Gabe is a fucking mess,
but he's my fucking mess.

01:21:56.241 --> 01:21:58.611
And right now he's in a lot of trouble.
And he needs me.

01:21:58.645 --> 01:22:01.246
So, if it's okay with you I'm going
to help him because I love him.

01:22:03.783 --> 01:22:05.117
Do you think
you could introduce me?

01:22:05.150 --> 01:22:06.285
Sir, no.

01:22:07.019 --> 01:22:08.220
Autograph.

01:22:08.253 --> 01:22:10.088
Oh, I...

01:22:10.122 --> 01:22:12.257
I'd really appreciate it
if you could make it out to Randy

01:22:12.291 --> 01:22:13.358
- with a Y.
- Oh, right.

01:22:13.392 --> 01:22:16.228
Wait! Wait! No! No! No!
No!

01:22:16.696 --> 01:22:20.132
Alec! Alec! Alec, No!

01:22:20.165 --> 01:22:21.467
Do not burn that cop.

01:22:23.803 --> 01:22:27.973
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Joe, Joe, Joe!

01:22:28.708 --> 01:22:30.008
- He, he, he burned him.
- Come on, Joe,

01:22:30.042 --> 01:22:31.243
- remember your training.
- He fucked up.

01:22:36.114 --> 01:22:38.685
- Really?
- Are you, are you okay?

01:22:39.418 --> 01:22:41.788
Okay, okay.

01:22:41.821 --> 01:22:43.322
Okay, okay.
We got you, man.

01:22:50.128 --> 01:22:52.164
<i>Dear Gabe, hi.</i>

01:22:53.499 --> 01:22:56.101
<i>I hope you're doing okay.
I'm doing fine.</i>

01:22:56.669 --> 01:22:59.338
<i>I've made a lot of new friends
at my new place.</i>

01:22:59.371 --> 01:23:01.373
<i>It's a place for kids
to get better.</i>

01:23:02.474 --> 01:23:04.577
<i>Sorry that I got arrested.</i>

01:23:04.611 --> 01:23:07.513
<i>It was pretty cool though, huh?</i>

01:23:07.547 --> 01:23:09.348
<i>I'd never been arrested before.</i>

01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:13.418
<i>That day was one of the
best days of my life.</i>

01:23:14.854 --> 01:23:18.190
<i>You're my best friend.
Write me back.</i>

01:23:18.223 --> 01:23:20.527
<i>I'll be here for a little while
longer.</i>

01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:23.830
<i>They think it's good for me
since I have a fire problem,</i>

01:23:23.863 --> 01:23:26.766
<i>but I don't want to set people
on fire like I used to.</i>

01:23:26.799 --> 01:23:29.334
- What's up, Jonny?
- Whatever, dork.

01:23:30.302 --> 01:23:31.503
<i>That's the old me.</i>

01:23:32.371 --> 01:23:33.640
<i>The new me is done with fire</i>

01:23:33.673 --> 01:23:36.174
<i>because fire burns people
and things.</i>

01:23:38.611 --> 01:23:41.681
Well, hope to talk you soon.
Love you.

01:23:41.714 --> 01:23:43.683
"Love you. Alec."

01:23:45.818 --> 01:23:48.320
It seems as though Alec still
really cares about you.

01:23:48.855 --> 01:23:52.190
Yeah, I guess so.
I mean, he writes me every week.

01:23:52.659 --> 01:23:55.460
I kind of feel bad for him.
I think he's just a kid trying to fit in.

01:23:56.563 --> 01:23:58.297
How long does he have to stay
in the group home?

01:23:58.330 --> 01:23:59.566
Two months.

01:23:59.599 --> 01:24:01.534
He comes home pretty soon,
actually.

01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:04.469
And your court session
the other day.

01:24:04.503 --> 01:24:06.606
What, what,
what happened with that?

01:24:06.639 --> 01:24:10.577
Oh. So, they dropped all the
charges except for resisting arrest.

01:24:10.610 --> 01:24:13.312
I mean I don't even know how you
get arrested for resisting arrest.

01:24:13.345 --> 01:24:17.316
That makes like, like
zero sense, but, surprisingly,

01:24:17.349 --> 01:24:20.587
Alec's mom and dad bailed me out
of jail to say they were sorry.

01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:23.088
And then they invited me over
for Salmon Saturday.

01:24:27.159 --> 01:24:28.126
And how about you, Millie?

01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:30.797
Uh, how have things been
since you moved in?

01:24:32.264 --> 01:24:35.635
Well, Gabe's been much more open
with me.

01:24:36.401 --> 01:24:38.303
I really appreciate him
for that.

01:24:38.771 --> 01:24:43.241
And in turn it's made me feel
more secure with us.

01:24:44.443 --> 01:24:48.748
And he gave me a key when he got out
of jail. We're best friends again.

01:24:48.781 --> 01:24:52.150
Yeah, when that cop was,
was punching me in the stomach

01:24:52.184 --> 01:24:55.387
and the other one was twisting
my arm and almost broke it,

01:24:55.420 --> 01:24:57.924
you know, I won't say my life
flashed before my eyes,

01:24:57.957 --> 01:25:00.627
but I realized, in that moment,

01:25:02.294 --> 01:25:04.897
I loved Millie more than anybody
I'd ever loved before.

01:25:07.734 --> 01:25:10.235
And then I saw Alec
light that detective on fire

01:25:10.268 --> 01:25:12.872
and sort of
lost my train of thought.

01:25:13.773 --> 01:25:17.710
May I ask what happened
with Bailey and the baby?

01:25:19.211 --> 01:25:20.145
Look at this.

01:25:22.414 --> 01:25:23.281
Read that.

01:25:26.518 --> 01:25:30.389
"Nigga, I ain't pregnant.
Just fucking with you.

01:25:31.824 --> 01:25:35.260
Found my bracelet,
it was in my closet.

01:25:35.293 --> 01:25:37.462
Love you. Call me."

01:25:38.998 --> 01:25:40.165
Keep scrolling.

01:25:42.234 --> 01:25:43.536
"Fuck you then!

01:25:43.569 --> 01:25:47.506
I got a new man and I hope
you and your bitch die

01:25:47.540 --> 01:25:48.675
from chicken pox."

01:25:50.275 --> 01:25:52.344
Purple heart, knife emoji.

01:25:54.279 --> 01:25:55.715
We got a restraining order.

01:25:55.748 --> 01:25:57.349
Wow!

01:25:57.382 --> 01:25:59.719
Yeah, but Millie and I,
we're doing good.

01:26:03.022 --> 01:26:04.590
I know, time's up.

01:26:06.258 --> 01:26:07.960
I'll see you, uh,
I'll see you next week.

01:26:07.994 --> 01:26:11.631
Actually, Millie and I are
going on a little trip,

01:26:11.664 --> 01:26:14.000
a little vacation
just, just us two.

01:26:14.033 --> 01:26:16.301
So, we won't be back
for a few Wednesdays,

01:26:16.334 --> 01:26:18.470
but, uh, give you a call?

01:26:18.503 --> 01:26:19.572
I understand.

01:26:21.607 --> 01:26:22.842
Thank you, Dr. Jones.

01:26:22.875 --> 01:26:23.810
Thank you.

01:26:24.610 --> 01:26:25.812
- Thanks, Doc.
- My pleasure.

01:26:26.478 --> 01:26:27.780
My office is always open to you.

01:29:22.755 --> 01:29:24.991
Oh, don't.
Honey, this is not our floor.

01:29:25.024 --> 01:29:27.093
- Your therapist is one more down.
- Whatever.

01:29:27.126 --> 01:29:28.861
Come on. There's room.

01:29:28.895 --> 01:29:32.531
No, no. It's okay.
We don't want to crowd y'all.

01:29:32.565 --> 01:29:35.433
Oh, no, no. Don't be silly,
there's plenty of room.

01:29:35.467 --> 01:29:37.570
- No, no. It's okay.
- Yeah, yeah. We're fine.

01:29:37.603 --> 01:29:38.871
We'll just take the next one.

01:29:38.905 --> 01:29:42.174
Oh, don't be silly,
just get on the elevator.

01:29:42.208 --> 01:29:45.544
No, no. We are okay,
but if you're in danger,

01:29:45.578 --> 01:29:46.779
I'm gonna need you
to blink twice.

01:29:48.614 --> 01:29:50.917
Wait, blink, what, what on earth
are you talking about?

01:29:50.950 --> 01:29:54.186
- I think she needs help.
- No, please. Please.

01:29:54.220 --> 01:29:55.588
Hey, you know, come with us
if you want to live.

01:29:55.621 --> 01:29:57.455
- Quick.
- Okay, okay, okay.

01:29:57.489 --> 01:30:00.559
Look, now you're just being rude.
Both of you.

01:30:00.593 --> 01:30:02.662
I am not in any danger.
This is my son.

01:30:03.829 --> 01:30:04.797
Wait. That's your son?

01:30:04.830 --> 01:30:07.633
Yes, he's adopted.
It's a thing.

01:30:07.667 --> 01:30:10.069
Oh, well, good for you.
Okay, you are going to heaven,

01:30:10.102 --> 01:30:12.905
but all the same, we don't want to
ride down the elevator with y'all.

01:30:12.939 --> 01:30:15.041
What did we do to you, huh?

01:30:15.074 --> 01:30:17.743
Besides try to be nice to you,
to be polite to you.

01:30:17.777 --> 01:30:19.011
Answer her.

01:30:19.045 --> 01:30:20.980
Okay, you know what?
There was a little white kid named Alec

01:30:21.013 --> 01:30:23.182
and he looks just like that one
you got right there.

01:30:23.215 --> 01:30:26.686
And his little badass almost got
me put in jail for five years.

01:30:26.719 --> 01:30:29.822
So, all the same, please take
your ass on down the elevator.

01:30:29.855 --> 01:30:31.791
Wait, Alec?

01:30:31.824 --> 01:30:35.695
Alec did this to me.
He made my leg all burnt up.

01:30:35.728 --> 01:30:37.163
That's why he's in therapy now.

01:30:37.196 --> 01:30:39.999
He's had nightmares since it happened.
Nightmares!

01:30:40.032 --> 01:30:41.534
Ah that's what you get
for bullying.

01:30:41.567 --> 01:30:44.270
Oh, and, by the way, that's why I beat
your little friends up at the park.

01:30:44.303 --> 01:30:45.838
Oh, and I hope
you have a terrible session

01:30:45.871 --> 01:30:46.906
and don't terrorize your mother.
Bye.

01:30:49.742 --> 01:30:52.078
- Really?
- What? Fuck that kid.

01:30:52.111 --> 01:30:53.713
We haven't even left
therapy yet.

01:30:53.746 --> 01:30:54.981
It's fine.
Let's just take the steps.

01:30:55.014 --> 01:30:57.049
Come on. I'll be better. Come on..
