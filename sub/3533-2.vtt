00:08.973 --> 00:10.942
Oh, God.

00:10.977 --> 00:12.111
Oh, God.

00:12.145 --> 00:13.080
Uh-huh.

00:13.114 --> 00:15.217
Look at me, Mom.
Look at me, Mom.

00:15.252 --> 00:18.356
Oh, yeah. Get it, Daddy. Mm.

00:18.391 --> 00:22.065
I feel like I could go
all fucking night.

00:22.099 --> 00:23.935
But you only paid for an hour,
baby.

00:23.970 --> 00:27.573
Oh, right. No, but if I had
paid for more, then I could...

00:27.607 --> 00:29.172
Ooh! Oh, God!

00:29.207 --> 00:31.610
Let it all out. Get a good
return on that dollar.

00:32.913 --> 00:35.383
That's it.
Gone on, get it.

00:43.297 --> 00:44.832
You know,
I didn't even know you ho's

00:44.867 --> 00:46.736
took credit cards until recently.

00:46.771 --> 00:49.274
Well, baby,
some do and some don't.

00:49.308 --> 00:50.710
The good ones do though.

00:53.715 --> 00:57.619
Do you remember
servicing this man?

00:59.622 --> 01:01.390
Oh, maybe. Who is he?

01:01.425 --> 01:04.227
He's just an old friend
that I've been looking for.

01:04.262 --> 01:08.301
Oh, so you wanted to fuck me
because your friend fucked me?

01:08.335 --> 01:10.170
Nope, I wanted to walk a mile
in his shoes.

01:10.205 --> 01:12.006
And today's shoes
just happened to be

01:12.040 --> 01:14.643
a big old pair
of comfy black boots.

01:17.816 --> 01:19.116
Bitch, don't call me no boots.

01:19.151 --> 01:20.719
Can I ask you another question?

01:21.687 --> 01:23.355
How was he?

01:23.390 --> 01:26.294
Oh, so you wanna know
if he was better than you?

01:26.328 --> 01:28.899
No, I just wanna know
what he was like.

01:31.235 --> 01:33.738
That motherfucker
was an animal.

01:37.044 --> 01:38.345
<i>Chapter Eight:</i>

01:38.379 --> 01:40.081
<i>Joining the new team.</i>

01:45.189 --> 01:46.389
Whew!

01:46.424 --> 01:47.791
<i>Over the course of my career,</i>

01:47.792 --> 01:49.427
<i>I played on many
different teams.</i>

01:49.461 --> 01:51.964
<i>Some I liked, and some I really fucking
hated</i>

01:53.567 --> 01:56.938
<i>but let's just say Seattle
can tongue-kiss my shit hole.</i>

01:56.972 --> 01:58.806
<i>The best way to get a new team
on your side</i>

01:58.840 --> 02:00.508
<i>is to trash the last team
you played for.</i>

02:00.542 --> 02:02.845
<i>Talk shit about
how their fans suck</i>

02:02.879 --> 02:04.913
<i>and their women
have pancake titties.</i>

02:04.948 --> 02:07.950
<i>And if that doesn't work,
then just like prison,</i>

02:07.985 --> 02:10.520
<i>you pick the biggest,
baddest dude on the team</i>

02:10.554 --> 02:13.724
<i>and you kick him
in his fucking teeth.</i>

02:13.759 --> 02:17.563
Boom! That's right.
Strike out.

02:17.597 --> 02:18.597
Yeah, good.

02:18.632 --> 02:21.066
Hey, buddy,
don't beat yourself up.

02:21.100 --> 02:23.168
You pretty much had
the whole entire force of God

02:24.270 --> 02:25.538
coming at you.
How fast was that?

02:25.572 --> 02:26.940
Felt like about 100.

02:26.974 --> 02:29.243
Last one was 90.
Oh, no shit.

02:29.277 --> 02:32.881
Maybe you should get your
radar gun recalibrated. Maybe.

02:32.915 --> 02:34.483
Maybe you should
ice that shoulder.

02:34.517 --> 02:35.752
It's been a while.

02:35.786 --> 02:38.088
Stay focused,
and you're gonna do just fine.

02:39.123 --> 02:40.491
Th's real cute, Roger,

02:40.525 --> 02:42.861
but you can save your pep talk
for somebody who needs it.

02:42.895 --> 02:46.032
I got this comeback locked down
tight like a little gi's tuna.

02:46.066 --> 02:48.735
Well, we'll see
about that, huh?

02:48.769 --> 02:50.503
This... This is totally
locked down tight

02:50.538 --> 02:53.207
like a girl's private parts,
who's small.

02:53.241 --> 02:54.876
Locker-room talk, baby.

02:58.748 --> 03:02.749
Mr. Powers. Petrus Marco

03:02.783 --> 03:04.682
What the hell you doing
trying to creep on me?

03:04.717 --> 03:06.082
I work for Mr. Cisneros,

03:06.117 --> 03:08.984
the owner of the Charros,
your new boss.

03:09.018 --> 03:10.250
He would like to meet you.

03:10.285 --> 03:11.784
Well, where the fuck is he?

03:11.818 --> 03:12.817
Follow me.

03:12.852 --> 03:15.085
You luring me
into a rape or something?

03:15.119 --> 03:16.018
What is this?

03:18.000 --> 03:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:25.158 --> 03:27.626
Not bad.
This is one hell of a pussy palace, huh?

03:27.660 --> 03:31.162
Lot of marbles
and architectures and shit.

03:31.197 --> 03:32.697
Flying buttresses.

03:32.731 --> 03:36.233
A lot of original artworks.
Very impressive.

03:36.267 --> 03:39.702
Mr. Cisneros is training
with his sensei.

03:39.736 --> 03:41.170
Sensei?

03:48.010 --> 03:50.779
Kenny Powers is here.

03:50.813 --> 03:51.946
That will be it for today.

03:51.981 --> 03:53.114
Kenny Powers, man.

03:53.148 --> 03:54.682
It's a pleasure
to meet you, man.

03:54.717 --> 03:57.151
Hey, good to meet you too, man.
That's a nice sword you got.

03:57.185 --> 03:59.953
Yeah, I didn't even know Asian
dudes even lived in Mexico,

03:59.987 --> 04:01.921
and here you got one training
you to be a ninja.

04:01.956 --> 04:03.456
Very impressive.
Oh, no, no, no.

04:03.490 --> 04:05.058
He's not from Mexico.

04:05.092 --> 04:07.560
I fly him from Tokyo, man.
Straight from the tap.

04:07.594 --> 04:10.796
Oh, high roller, huh?
Goddamn, look at that view.

04:10.830 --> 04:12.597
Seeing this house
and your fine sword

04:12.632 --> 04:15.099
and hearing how you're importing
and exporting Chinamen,

04:15.133 --> 04:16.767
let me guess,
you must be fucking rich.

04:16.802 --> 04:19.336
Yeah. It's cool.

04:19.370 --> 04:22.972
How much exactly does it cost
to b a Mexican baseball team?

04:23.006 --> 04:24.540
Ten bucks and a burrito?

04:28.679 --> 04:31.814
That's racism, man.
I love to racism, bro.

04:31.849 --> 04:34.183
Ah, I could tell by the look
in your face

04:34.217 --> 04:37.219
you didn't think that there was.

04:37.253 --> 04:39.154
I definitely didn't think
there was anybody

04:40.556 --> 04:44.258
<i>How'd you snag all this loot? v.</i>

04:44.292 --> 04:47.894
Well, my parents died
in, like, a plane crash

04:47.895 --> 04:50.663
and, you know, my pappy,
he died right away

04:50.697 --> 04:53.533
but my mommy, she lingered,
so it was a tough decision, man,

04:53.567 --> 04:55.067
but I had to pull the plug,
you know?

04:56.269 --> 04:58.304
I killed my mother.
It's okay.

04:58.338 --> 05:00.606
Shit, that's pretty heavy stuff.
Man, that must suck.

05:00.640 --> 05:04.309
Yeah, it sucks to be an orphan.
But you know what doesn't suck?

05:04.343 --> 05:06.277
Being a millionaire.

05:06.311 --> 05:08.045
I see it does have
its advantages.

05:08.080 --> 05:11.415
You know, me and you, we have
more in common than you realize.

05:11.449 --> 05:14.984
I, too, am very, very wealthy.
I'm also an orphan.

05:15.019 --> 05:17.287
My dad ran out on me
when I was just a kid.

05:17.321 --> 05:19.655
All he left was a batch
of hepatitis on the toilet seat.

05:19.690 --> 05:21.023
Ah.
Yeah,

05:21.058 --> 05:23.425
had to build my whole empire
from the ground up by myself.

05:23.460 --> 05:25.793
Solo.
You re famous at one point.

05:25.828 --> 05:26.994
I'm still pretty famous.

05:28.596 --> 05:30.030
Still have a lot of fame.

05:30.064 --> 05:33.867
Yeah, okay, man.
I wanna cut right to the chase.

05:33.901 --> 05:35.268
How can I help you?

05:35.302 --> 05:38.904
We, I'll tell you how
you can help me, Sebastian.

05:38.938 --> 05:41.206
You do realize when I take
the mound this Friday night,

05:41.240 --> 05:43.074
it's going to be the first time
Kenny Powers

05:43.108 --> 05:44.775
has taken the mound
in quite a long time.

05:44.809 --> 05:47.711
It's a fucking big deal,
and not just to me.

05:47.745 --> 05:49.646
To you, to the whole team,

05:49.680 --> 05:51.380
to the fucking villagers,
everybody.

05:51.414 --> 05:52.648
Okay, I... I got it.

05:52.682 --> 05:55.083
Do you want me to get, like,
the publicity department

05:55.117 --> 05:57.085
to organize something,
like, the pictures,

05:57.119 --> 05:59.021
and to supply the rainbows
and the unicorns,

05:59.055 --> 06:00.789
like, all the stuff
that you were saying?

06:00.823 --> 06:02.990
We're fucking sharing a brain
right here. Exactly.

06:03.025 --> 06:04.359
That's it, man.
Yup.

06:04.393 --> 06:05.993
I want this shit
to have the pageantry

06:06.028 --> 06:07.228
of a goddamn Alabama concert.

06:07.262 --> 06:09.129
Talking about fireworks,
smoke bombs,

06:09.164 --> 06:10.531
laser beams, moonwalks.

06:10.565 --> 06:12.732
You know how your people
lit up the Alamo?

06:12.767 --> 06:14.267
That's the shit
I'm talking about.

06:14.301 --> 06:15.401
Pow.

06:15.435 --> 06:17.269
You're like a showman, man.
I get it.

06:17.304 --> 06:18.905
Yes, like a...
No, not like a showman.

06:18.939 --> 06:21.140
Part entertainer?
Yes, of course.

06:21.175 --> 06:23.376
But I consider myself
more like a retired gunfighter

06:23.410 --> 06:27.145
being called out of retirement
for one more fucking showdown.

06:27.180 --> 06:28.646
Can I ask you one question,
though?

06:28.681 --> 06:30.681
Do you plan on just having
one showdown

06:30.715 --> 06:32.282
or is it going to be
a lot of showdowns?

06:32.316 --> 06:34.050
No, there'll be
multiple showdowns.

06:34.084 --> 06:35.318
Multiple showdowns?
Yeah.

06:35.352 --> 06:37.519
I'm not trying to sign
a Mexican contract or no shit.

06:37.554 --> 06:39.554
We'll take it game by game,
but of course, yeah,

06:39.589 --> 06:41.556
I'm definitely playing
for more than one game.

06:41.590 --> 06:43.657
You guarantee that.
Done.

06:43.692 --> 06:46.726
Everything you want, man.
It's done. To you, man.

06:47.828 --> 06:49.562
Bam.
Mm-hm.

07:24.497 --> 07:25.797
Kenny!
Aah!

07:25.831 --> 07:27.598
Oh, shit!

07:28.767 --> 07:30.501
Oh, Kenny, you shot me!
Oh, shit!

07:31.770 --> 07:33.571
Come on, stop screaming!

07:33.605 --> 07:34.872
Stop fucking screaming!

07:34.907 --> 07:38.242
Oh, my God! Kenny!

07:38.277 --> 07:39.911
What the fuck
are you doing here?

07:39.945 --> 07:43.680
I came to find you!
I'm not doing too good, Kenny!

07:44.715 --> 07:45.915
Shh! Shh!

07:45.949 --> 07:48.417
All right. This is gonna
kill the infection.

07:50.253 --> 07:52.287
Oh, shit!

07:53.622 --> 07:55.723
Oh, shit. My bad.

07:55.757 --> 07:56.723
That's margarita mix.

07:56.757 --> 07:58.057
Oh, God!

07:58.091 --> 07:59.925
Don't go into shock!
I'm going into shock!

07:59.959 --> 08:01.293
Don't go into fucking shock!

08:01.327 --> 08:02.928
I'm going into shock.

08:02.962 --> 08:04.863
Stay awake. Just stay awake.

08:07.466 --> 08:08.900
I'll be right back.

08:10.502 --> 08:12.471
<i>Que paso?
Yo, do you guys</i>

08:12.505 --> 08:13.739
have any goddamn Band-Aids,

08:13.773 --> 08:15.440
Q-tips, Mercurochrome,
some Vagisil,

08:15.475 --> 08:17.042
shit like at,
first-aid stuff?

08:21.680 --> 08:22.714
Come on!

08:22.748 --> 08:24.082
My sister Maria, she's a nurse.

08:24.116 --> 08:26.050
You... You got blood.
You hurt or something?

08:26.085 --> 08:28.586
<i>Yes, goddamn it.
We have a Rescue 911 situation.</i>

08:28.620 --> 08:31.689
Come on! Come on, weird woman!
Go! Siesta. Come on!

08:34.926 --> 08:37.126
- What happened?
- I don't know.

08:37.159 --> 08:39.095
I think he shot himself
in his leg.

08:39.129 --> 08:40.696
Fire. My leg is on fire.

08:40.730 --> 08:42.730
You're not on fire, Stevie.

08:42.765 --> 08:44.063
You're in a bathtub, okay?

08:44.099 --> 08:46.632
These people are friends.
The lady one is gonna help you.

08:46.666 --> 08:47.932
You can fix him, right?

08:49.635 --> 08:51.236
<i>English, por favor.</i>

08:51.270 --> 08:53.638
She can fix him,
but he's gonna have to stay put.

08:53.673 --> 08:56.040
As in stay put here in my home?

08:56.074 --> 08:57.608
<i>Sí. Yes.</i>

08:57.642 --> 08:58.909
All right, I mean,

08:58.943 --> 09:01.812
I just really wasn't
prepared to have guests.

09:01.846 --> 09:03.213
Good to see you, Kenny.

09:03.247 --> 09:06.183
Shh. Please don't speak.
Just get better.

10:12.571 --> 10:14.639
Well, I see Sebastian
put up some banners.

10:15.540 --> 10:17.374
Yeah. Nice banner.

10:17.409 --> 10:20.444
I do hope you're kidding.
Looks like shit.

10:20.478 --> 10:22.612
What the hell's he doing,
printing that from JPEG?

10:22.647 --> 10:24.281
Motherfucker needs
to use TIFF files.

10:24.315 --> 10:26.382
My face looks computery
and damn pixelated.

10:26.417 --> 10:28.851
Actually, Kenny, that's a lot
of fanfare for the Charros.

10:28.885 --> 10:32.121
Could be a major distraction
to the team, Kenny.

10:32.155 --> 10:33.889
Oh, are some of the guys
talking shit?

10:33.923 --> 10:36.190
No, no, nothing like that.
Are they getting jealous?

10:36.225 --> 10:38.626
They're just losing focus.
They're getting jealous.

10:38.660 --> 10:40.694
Let me unify the team
real quick. Guys.

10:40.728 --> 10:42.362
Guys, come on in here.
Hey, Kenny.

10:42.397 --> 10:44.064
We need you to warm up that arm.
Come on!

10:44.098 --> 10:47.233
Can I get y'all to come in?
Come on. Let's go. Come in.

10:47.268 --> 10:48.568
Can we take a knee?

10:48.602 --> 10:50.102
Guys, can we take a knee?

10:50.137 --> 10:53.238
Knee. Down on the knee.

10:53.273 --> 10:55.707
Roger, help me out here, dude.

10:57.009 --> 10:59.077
Come on, guys. Okay.

10:59.111 --> 11:00.778
Now, this Friday night,

11:00.813 --> 11:02.213
I guarantee you it is gonna be

11:02.247 --> 11:04.448
the biggest goddamn
comeback celebration

11:04.483 --> 11:05.849
any of y'all have ever seen.

11:05.884 --> 11:07.351
There's gonna
be people cheering,

11:07.385 --> 11:08.785
and spotlights and fireworks.

11:08.820 --> 11:10.854
I wouldn't even doubt
if there's a couple chicks

11:10.888 --> 11:12.422
showing their fucking pussies
off.

11:12.456 --> 11:14.056
How do you say "pussy"
in Spanish?

11:14.091 --> 11:16.892
<i>- Panocha.
- Panocha?</i>

11:16.926 --> 11:18.994
<i>I wouldn't doubt
if some of the muchachas</i>

11:19.028 --> 11:20.195
<i>show their panochas off.</i>

11:20.229 --> 11:21.829
<i>They might show
their panochas off.</i>

11:21.864 --> 11:24.265
<i>They might be waving their
panochas all over the place.</i>

11:24.299 --> 11:26.367
What I don't want to happen
is to be looking around

11:26.401 --> 11:28.569
while everybody's fucking
screaming and cheering

11:28.603 --> 11:30.771
and celebrating me
and see all my teammates pouting

11:30.805 --> 11:32.539
and being jealous
little bitches, dude.

11:32.573 --> 11:35.770
Okay? Remember,
there is no I in "team,"

11:35.804 --> 11:37.670
but there is a U in "cunt,"

11:37.704 --> 11:39.671
so don't be little
jealous cunts, okay?

11:39.706 --> 11:42.207
Let me get the praise,
and just be satisfied

11:42.242 --> 11:45.410
<i>with the fact that you will get
the run-off panocha.</i>

11:45.445 --> 11:47.045
Um, you done?
You done, Kenny?

11:47.079 --> 11:49.580
Yeah, I'm done. I don't know why
we're all fucking around.

11:49.614 --> 11:51.415
We got a game to get ready for.

11:51.449 --> 11:53.783
Let's get back to practice.
Come on. Get into this shit.

11:55.720 --> 11:57.621
<i>- Come on, vamanos.
- Let's go, Kenny.</i>

11:57.655 --> 11:59.356
Get to work.
Let's do this shit.

13:24.924 --> 13:28.193
What is thy name, steed?

13:28.228 --> 13:29.661
What the hell e you doing?

13:29.696 --> 13:32.431
Playing petting zoo, trying to
get a fucking staph infection?

13:32.465 --> 13:34.399
I'm just checking out
your new digs, man.

13:34.434 --> 13:35.901
That donkey is pretty cool.

13:35.935 --> 13:38.470
I guess if you're walking around
playing Doctor Doolittle,

13:38.504 --> 13:40.138
your leg must not be hurt
too bad.

13:40.172 --> 13:41.205
No, I'm hurt pretty bad.

13:41.239 --> 13:42.873
Being shot definitely hurts,
Kenny.

13:42.907 --> 13:46.009
Yeah, well, so does having a gun
go off by accident in your hand.

13:46.043 --> 13:48.411
The middle of my palm's
been stinging all day.

13:48.445 --> 13:51.213
Almost like an itch burn.

13:51.248 --> 13:53.982
I have fucking missed you, man.
I missed you a lot.

13:54.017 --> 13:55.784
Did you miss me, man?
I'm so glad to see you.

13:55.818 --> 13:57.385
Yeah, yeah.
Enough with the hugs.

13:57.420 --> 13:59.621
Yeah, I missed you,
big time. Mm-hm.

13:59.655 --> 14:01.756
But real quick,
how the fuck did you find me?

14:01.791 --> 14:03.858
Oh, that mystery.

14:03.892 --> 14:06.894
When the charges first started
showing up on my credit card,

14:06.929 --> 14:09.464
I thought,
"This is fucking fraud,"

14:09.498 --> 14:11.666
but then I looked
a little bit closer

14:11.700 --> 14:13.267
at what was being purchased:

14:13.302 --> 14:16.470
Beer, Jager, lube,
Magnum condoms.

14:16.504 --> 14:18.271
Mm-mm. Nope. Not me.

14:18.306 --> 14:20.640
Whippets, business cards.

14:20.675 --> 14:22.008
And that's when I realized

14:22.042 --> 14:24.910
you were leaving me a trail
of fucking bread crumbs.

14:25.879 --> 14:27.679
Bread crumbs?
Yeah,

14:27.713 --> 14:29.247
$22,000 worth of bread crumbs

14:29.281 --> 14:31.282
that led me straight to you,
motherfucker.

14:31.316 --> 14:32.750
You're being serious?

14:32.785 --> 14:35.920
Yeah, I'm serious.

14:35.954 --> 14:37.721
Well, that's good.
Because you're right.

14:37.756 --> 14:40.290
That's exactly
what my intentions were.

14:40.324 --> 14:42.992
I'm glad you were able
to decipher my da Vinci code.

14:43.026 --> 14:44.926
Welcome to the fucking manger,
homes.

14:44.961 --> 14:47.796
I am glad that you sent me
a complex code, Kenny.

14:47.830 --> 14:50.765
I am ready to fucking party.

14:50.800 --> 14:52.234
I guess we're gonna party.

14:52.268 --> 14:53.435
Fuck, yeah!

14:53.469 --> 14:55.270
Whoo!

14:57.907 --> 15:00.241
This is the greatest night
of my life!

15:00.275 --> 15:01.575
This is me every night, dude,

15:01.610 --> 15:04.111
just staring at butt holes
and getting a buzz on.

15:04.145 --> 15:06.045
Oh, this is awesome.

15:06.080 --> 15:09.113
You can totally see
straight through the butt hole,

15:09.148 --> 15:12.148
right into the pussy, man.
That is awesome.

15:12.183 --> 15:14.718
Man, I don't think those
two things are connected.

15:14.752 --> 15:16.386
Maybe.

15:16.420 --> 15:18.722
So, what's the haps

15:18.756 --> 15:20.523
back in Bumfuck?

15:20.558 --> 15:22.158
You know that shit hole.

15:22.192 --> 15:24.093
Nothing ever changes.

15:24.127 --> 15:25.827
Clegg is in rehab.

15:25.862 --> 15:27.728
Again?
Yeah.

15:27.763 --> 15:29.796
And I was going over
to your brother's house a lot

15:29.831 --> 15:32.064
after you left. But something
must have happened,

15:32.099 --> 15:34.569
because then he says to me
that I can't come over

15:34.603 --> 15:36.873
and play with the boys
when he's not there anymore.

15:36.908 --> 15:38.808
Stevie, I don't give a shit
about any of them.

15:38.842 --> 15:40.609
What's going on with April?

15:42.745 --> 15:44.312
Stevie, I asked you
a question, man.

15:44.347 --> 15:45.980
What's going on with April?

15:46.015 --> 15:49.016
Uh, I haven't seen
much of April lately.

15:49.050 --> 15:51.684
Hope she's not just locked up
in her house, hooked on meds.

15:51.718 --> 15:53.418
That's a slippery slope.

15:53.453 --> 15:56.253
Well, I guess after you left,

15:56.287 --> 15:58.888
she got back together
with Cutler

15:58.922 --> 16:00.422
and, uh,

16:00.457 --> 16:03.658
they ended up getting married.

16:05.127 --> 16:07.228
Married?
Yeah.

16:07.262 --> 16:08.763
Are you fucking kidding me?

16:08.797 --> 16:10.364
No, I'm not kidding you.

16:10.399 --> 16:12.232
After I conquered him
in the love triangle,

16:12.266 --> 16:13.633
she went ahead and married him?

16:13.667 --> 16:15.768
Yeah, I'm sorry.

16:15.802 --> 16:17.202
That's great for her.

16:17.236 --> 16:19.671
Good thing I'm in the midst
of this monumental comeback.

16:19.705 --> 16:21.372
Honestly,
I just feel sorry for her.

16:21.407 --> 16:22.740
Me too.
I mean, I have no idea

16:22.774 --> 16:24.408
what it would be like
just to live a life

16:24.442 --> 16:26.076
full of fucking compromises.

16:26.110 --> 16:29.011
Unbelievable. To Cutler?
Yeah.

16:29.046 --> 16:32.247
To Cutler.
So you can move on or...

16:36.350 --> 16:39.351
Hey, I meant to ask you.

16:39.386 --> 16:41.453
When exactly
are you heading back home?

16:41.487 --> 16:43.221
Whenever I want.

16:43.255 --> 16:46.223
I got an open-ended ticket,
nigga.

16:48.326 --> 16:51.898
You got burritos and tacos,

16:51.932 --> 16:56.068
but in the America
you got pizza and hamburger.

16:56.102 --> 16:57.602
What the fuck
are you talking about?

16:57.637 --> 16:59.604
Go around. Jesus Christ.

16:59.638 --> 17:01.239
Go around.

17:01.273 --> 17:03.074
Steve.

17:03.108 --> 17:05.709
Steve. H.

17:05.742 --> 17:07.344
Hey.
Hey, where you been?

17:07.377 --> 17:09.211
I just got into town,
so I didn't know you...

17:09.246 --> 17:10.846
She's talking to me,
you dipshit.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.082
Uh, I've been around.
How are you doing?

17:14.116 --> 17:16.284
I'm good.
I'm playing tonight,

17:16.318 --> 17:19.420
so you and your friend
should come see me.

17:19.454 --> 17:21.621
Yeah, well, I don't think
I'll be able to catch that.

17:21.655 --> 17:24.356
I just had some, uh,
pretty devastating news

17:24.391 --> 17:25.924
dropped on top
of my fucking head,

17:25.958 --> 17:27.325
and so I need a little
bit of time

17:27.358 --> 17:28.826
just to kind of marinate on it

17:28.860 --> 17:31.428
and work out my hormones
and shit.

17:31.462 --> 17:35.063
You should also know that, uh,
my name is not really Steve.

17:35.098 --> 17:37.465
It's actually Kenny,
Kenny Powers.

17:37.500 --> 17:39.100
I'm a world-famous
baseball player.

17:39.134 --> 17:41.169
I don't think
I shared that with you.

17:41.203 --> 17:42.803
Wait, your name's not Steve?

17:42.838 --> 17:44.338
No, I was using an alias.

17:44.372 --> 17:46.406
Steve just kind of seems
like the name

17:46.441 --> 17:49.108
of somebody who has absolutely
nothing going on in their life.

17:51.811 --> 17:53.677
Uh, looks like
your friend is sick.

17:53.711 --> 17:55.445
You should get him home.

17:55.479 --> 17:56.812
Yeah, I'm gonna do that.

17:56.846 --> 17:58.146
<i>Adios, mamasita.</i>

17:58.181 --> 17:59.881
Bye.

18:05.887 --> 18:07.153
You ready to go home, buddy?

18:07.187 --> 18:08.421
Yeah.

18:08.455 --> 18:10.856
Yeah, I'm gonna get you home.
Let's go.

18:10.890 --> 18:13.158
<i>On the long road
to grief recovery,</i>

18:13.159 --> 18:15.760
<i>don't be surprised if you gotta
spill a little blood</i>

18:15.794 --> 18:17.128
<i>On the long road
to get shit fixed.</i>

18:18.663 --> 18:21.398
<i>With all great comebacks,
somebody usually gets fucked.</i>

18:36.547 --> 18:40.016
Excuse me.
Where is this truck headed?

18:41.118 --> 18:42.251
America.

18:43.420 --> 18:45.754
Oh, fuck.

18:48.956 --> 18:50.456
<i>Sometimes being on the mend</i>

18:50.490 --> 18:52.889
<i>can get old real quick,</i>

18:52.924 --> 18:54.789
<i>like when you're doing
all this awesome shit</i>

18:54.823 --> 18:56.991
<i>to show motherfuckers
that you're cool now,</i>

18:57.025 --> 18:58.892
<i>and one day you realize
that maybe the person</i>

18:58.926 --> 19:00.860
<i>you're truly trying
to fix yourself for</i>

19:00.895 --> 19:02.628
<i>has moved the fuck on.</i>

19:04.698 --> 19:09.303
<i>And there you are,
left in the midst of a battle</i>

19:09.337 --> 19:12.206
<i>that suddenly means nothing.</i>

19:24.382 --> 19:26.549
Jesus, Kenny,
what are you doing?

19:27.918 --> 19:30.052
Just thinking.

19:31.922 --> 19:33.556
Well, come on, man.
We called timeout.

19:33.590 --> 19:34.623
Let's get you in the game.

19:40.063 --> 19:41.697
I don't think
I can go out there, Roger.

19:41.731 --> 19:45.066
I'm not sure if I'm feeling it.

19:45.101 --> 19:47.035
To be honest,
I was just primarily

19:47.069 --> 19:48.203
mounting this comeback

19:48.237 --> 19:50.105
to eventually get back
a girl I lost,

19:50.139 --> 19:53.676
and now it seems
that that girl has moved on.

19:53.710 --> 19:55.745
I fear I lost my inspiration.

19:55.780 --> 19:58.048
Are you really gonna drop this
on me right now?

19:58.082 --> 20:00.883
Yeah, dude.
That's just the fucking score.

20:00.918 --> 20:04.787
I don't know if a pep-talk
speech would work or not.

20:04.821 --> 20:07.156
Nobody's really tried yet.

20:13.530 --> 20:16.098
Um...

20:16.132 --> 20:18.000
I know this locker room

20:18.034 --> 20:21.170
isn't exactly
what you were thinking about

20:21.205 --> 20:23.639
en you were a kid dreaming
about playing ball one day.

20:23.674 --> 20:25.808
Right?
No, it's pretty shitty.

20:25.842 --> 20:29.945
But... But I've been involved
with this game all my life.

20:31.214 --> 20:35.416
And if there's one thing I know,
it's talent.

20:35.450 --> 20:38.418
And you've got it.

20:38.453 --> 20:43.156
That arm can take you
wherever you wanna go.

20:43.190 --> 20:45.792
You just gotta put it to work,
that's all.

20:45.826 --> 20:47.360
Now, don't...

20:47.394 --> 20:51.196
Don't do this comeback
for some fucking girl.

20:53.164 --> 20:54.431
Do it for you.

20:54.466 --> 20:57.434
So you're saying
I should just say,

20:57.469 --> 20:59.702
"Fuck April
and her big old tits"?

20:59.737 --> 21:02.204
Well, you don't have
to go that far, but...

21:02.239 --> 21:04.374
You see what's happening here?

21:05.876 --> 21:10.113
We're having one of those
star player-coach moments.

21:11.248 --> 21:12.482
You feel like playing?

21:12.516 --> 21:16.118
I still feel a little wounded
but, you know,

21:16.152 --> 21:18.853
Sebastian put all these
awesome promotions up for me

21:18.887 --> 21:21.856
and all the fucking
villagers showed up,

21:21.890 --> 21:23.991
so I guess the least
I could do is just, you know,

21:24.025 --> 21:25.759
drop a little knowledge
on them.

21:25.793 --> 21:26.893
That's right.

21:26.928 --> 21:28.995
Let's get out there

21:29.030 --> 21:33.233
and make some fucking noise,
okay?

21:33.267 --> 21:35.935
You... You really want me
to make some noise?

21:35.970 --> 21:37.437
Yeah.

21:37.471 --> 21:40.806
Then noise you shall see.

21:40.840 --> 21:42.975
Let my Latin debut to begin.

The glove.
Bring me my glove.

23:10.684 --> 23:11.984
Glove! Come on.
Hurry up.

23:12.019 --> 23:13.786
It's time for the second part
of the show.

23:13.820 --> 23:15.754
Thank you. Get the flag.
Pick the flag up.

23:15.789 --> 23:18.424
Come on. Don't just let it
lay there. It's disrespectful.

23:18.458 --> 23:20.458
Don't let it drag.

24:23.076 --> 24:25.077
Wolverines.

24:53.504 --> 24:55.605
Fuck.

25:16.890 --> 25:18.090
Did I miss the game?

25:18.124 --> 25:20.125
Yeah, I didn't have anybody here
to support me,

25:20.159 --> 25:21.993
but it's all right.

25:22.027 --> 25:23.361
Kenny, I'm sorry.

25:23.395 --> 25:25.563
Sorry I missed the game.
I don't know what happened.

25:25.597 --> 25:27.531
I might have gotten
kidnapped or something.

25:27.565 --> 25:30.033
Yeah, Stevie,
you weren't kidnapped.

25:30.067 --> 25:33.335
I put you on that truck so I
wouldn't have to deal with you.

25:33.369 --> 25:34.735
What?

25:34.770 --> 25:35.969
Yeah, you remind me of home,

25:36.004 --> 25:38.138
and for obvious reasons,
home is painful to me.

25:38.172 --> 25:39.672
Because you miss the children?

25:39.707 --> 25:41.907
Yeah, Stevie, because I miss
the fucking children.

25:41.941 --> 25:44.077
No. It's...

25:44.111 --> 25:46.147
Look, I'm just not
100 percent proud

25:46.181 --> 25:48.715
of the way everything
went down there, all right?

25:48.750 --> 25:50.984
And when I saw your stupid,
dumb, happy face,

25:51.018 --> 25:52.585
it just reminded me
of all that shit.

25:52.619 --> 25:55.388
You know, I wish it didn't.
I feel bad about it.

25:55.422 --> 25:57.389
It just seems like your face
and our friendship

25:57.424 --> 25:59.291
is kind of
the collateral damage.

25:59.325 --> 26:01.893
Kenny.

26:01.927 --> 26:03.494
Oh, come on, man.

26:03.529 --> 26:07.198
I kneel before you as a man,
begging a much better man

26:07.232 --> 26:08.999
to please let me stay here

26:09.033 --> 26:12.601
and join you
on this Hispanic adventure.

26:12.635 --> 26:17.238
Kenny, I work in a fucking
coffee shop.

26:17.272 --> 26:20.708
A fucking coffee shop
back in Shelby.

26:20.743 --> 26:22.843
Please just let me stay here

26:22.878 --> 26:24.678
and tear this shit up with you,
Kenny.

26:24.713 --> 26:26.580
I will do whatever you want.
That's enough.

26:26.614 --> 26:30.349
Okay, I will do whatever
you want in fucking Mexico!

26:30.383 --> 26:31.851
You should just get up off...

26:31.885 --> 26:33.420
I will do whatever you want!

26:33.454 --> 26:35.354
Come on. Get up.
I will get up when...

26:35.388 --> 26:37.055
Get up! Just get the fuck up.
Stop, man.

26:37.090 --> 26:39.657
Everyone's looking at us.
Jesus Christ.

26:39.691 --> 26:41.025
Look...

26:42.695 --> 26:45.229
...this is a dangerous place,
Stevie.

26:45.264 --> 26:47.064
I know.

26:47.099 --> 26:48.932
If you were to stay here,

26:48.967 --> 26:51.935
I can't guarantee
that you'd make it home alive.

26:53.070 --> 26:55.137
You would not only
be responsible

26:55.172 --> 26:58.173
for watching your own back,
but also mine.

26:58.207 --> 26:59.341
You'd also be responsible

26:59.375 --> 27:01.943
for doing a lot
of my personal errands,

27:01.977 --> 27:04.479
more than likely, my laundry.

27:04.513 --> 27:07.748
Kenny, I am so fucking ready

27:07.783 --> 27:10.351
to get hard-core
with fucking errands

27:10.385 --> 27:12.687
or slapping
whoever fucking steps up

27:12.721 --> 27:14.922
right in the fucking face.

27:14.956 --> 27:16.123
Are you?

27:16.158 --> 27:18.359
Yes.

27:24.165 --> 27:26.299
Welcome to the resistance.

27:28.102 --> 27:29.403
Fuck, yes.
