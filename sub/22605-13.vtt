00:15.358 --> 00:16.492
What's the word?

00:16.493 --> 00:17.660
Straight-up robbery.

00:17.661 --> 00:20.140
Neighbor reported a
couple of suspicious guys

00:20.141 --> 00:21.028
walking out with stuff.

00:21.029 --> 00:22.296
Diplomat's place, right?

00:22.297 --> 00:23.764
Oh, yeah.

00:23.765 --> 00:26.132
Did you hear that?

00:52.088 --> 00:54.457
- What's up with that?
- Somebody locked in there?

00:56.326 --> 00:58.594
Police!

00:58.595 --> 00:59.896
Anyone in there?

01:01.698 --> 01:03.598
- Ready?
- Oh, yeah.

01:07.236 --> 01:09.638
Geez.

01:13.076 --> 01:14.644
What's this? What's going on?

01:14.645 --> 01:17.780
Officer Freeman, Metropolitan Police.

01:17.781 --> 01:19.348
- Is this your house, sir?
- Yes.

01:19.349 --> 01:20.716
You've been robbed.

01:20.717 --> 01:24.152
What are you doing holding
this woman prisoner?

01:25.121 --> 01:27.990
I am a diplomat of the Kingdom of Bahrain.

01:27.991 --> 01:29.025
I demand

01:29.026 --> 01:30.792
immunity.

01:40.837 --> 01:42.738
Really?

01:42.739 --> 01:45.875
They were on your dad's
list of acceptable groceries.

01:45.876 --> 01:47.376
For his heart condition.

01:47.377 --> 01:49.045
What kind of heart condition is addressed

01:49.046 --> 01:50.213
by rye and Haagen-Dazs?

01:50.214 --> 01:51.914
A broken one.

01:51.915 --> 01:53.649
Oh, come on, please.

01:53.650 --> 01:55.351
My mom died three years ago.

01:55.352 --> 01:57.487
He's dated half the widows in Pittsburgh.

01:58.989 --> 02:02.458
Only my dad would announce
a visit 48 hours in advance

02:02.459 --> 02:04.694
and then serve us with a list of demands.

02:04.695 --> 02:06.829
Okay, let's just try
and make him comfortable.

02:06.830 --> 02:08.330
Oh, he'll get comfortable,

02:08.332 --> 02:10.233
and then he'll ask us for something.

02:10.234 --> 02:12.335
Oh, he says he wants to see the kids,

02:12.336 --> 02:13.970
and they love him, so...

02:13.971 --> 02:16.939
The guy's just not wired to
think about anyone but himself.

02:16.940 --> 02:19.976
Okay, I know that he was not the
world's most attentive father.

02:19.977 --> 02:20.989
Yeah.

02:20.990 --> 02:24.580
But can you just try and
get along with him... for me?

02:24.581 --> 02:25.715
How can you be so understanding?

02:25.716 --> 02:27.282
He treats you worse than anyone.

02:28.484 --> 02:30.052
Because I'm a professional peacemaker.

02:30.053 --> 02:31.420
Ha.

02:31.421 --> 02:33.389
Besides...

02:33.390 --> 02:36.024
he's the only thing luring Stevie home.

02:38.394 --> 02:42.298
I want it to be like...
before she hated me.

02:42.299 --> 02:43.966
She does not hate you.

02:43.967 --> 02:46.869
No. She thinks I'm evil.

02:52.475 --> 02:54.876
Yeah.

02:56.212 --> 02:58.014
Yeah, okay.

02:58.015 --> 02:59.682
Professional peacemaker?

02:59.683 --> 03:02.118
Yeah.

03:02.119 --> 03:04.519
Bye.

03:05.154 --> 03:07.190
The police found his maid

03:07.191 --> 03:08.858
living in a locked boiler room.

03:08.859 --> 03:10.760
- Seriously?
- Kemala Shihab.

03:10.761 --> 03:12.628
She's a migrant worker from Indonesia.

03:12.629 --> 03:14.197
The Hassanis took her passport,

03:14.198 --> 03:16.732
didn't let her out of
the house for three years.

03:16.733 --> 03:18.067
How's she doing?

03:18.068 --> 03:20.303
Well, at County Hospital,
being treated for malnutrition.

03:20.304 --> 03:22.104
I can't wait to hear Hassani's defense.

03:22.105 --> 03:24.240
Well, it's going to be hard to extract one

03:24.241 --> 03:27.076
since he and his wife took
refuge in the Bahraini embassy.

03:27.077 --> 03:29.078
An MPD clerk let them go

03:29.079 --> 03:30.513
once an embassy official arrived

03:30.514 --> 03:31.981
and corroborated their immunity claim.

03:31.982 --> 03:35.251
No, Hassani's not ranked
high enough to merit immunity.

03:35.252 --> 03:36.886
It's kind of gray, actually.

03:36.887 --> 03:38.487
Not for a consular officer.

03:38.488 --> 03:40.990
And especially not for keeping
a slave in your basement.

03:40.991 --> 03:43.726
Well, immunity at the
consular level is case by case.

03:43.727 --> 03:45.895
Any diplomat is eligible,

03:45.896 --> 03:47.797
but it's an unwritten rule, ma'am.

03:47.798 --> 03:51.334
Well, then I am definitely... unwriting it.

03:51.335 --> 03:53.502
Even if DOD just sank a billion dollars

03:53.503 --> 03:55.143
into renovating our naval base in Manama?

03:56.206 --> 03:57.740
The base is crucial to
our strategic positions

03:57.741 --> 03:59.008
around Iraq and Iran.

03:59.009 --> 04:01.877
Iraq and Iran, yes, I'm aware.

04:06.582 --> 04:08.651
We're rejecting Bahrain's immunity claim.

04:08.652 --> 04:10.286
Blake, serve the ambassador

04:10.287 --> 04:11.387
with a waiver.

04:11.388 --> 04:12.822
You want him to revoke their claim?

04:12.823 --> 04:14.323
That shouldn't be too hard.

04:14.324 --> 04:17.159
Let's give Bahrain a chance
to get with the program.

04:17.160 --> 04:18.894
I'm familiar with their royal family.

04:18.894 --> 04:20.029
They're not all hard-liners.

04:20.029 --> 04:21.664
- Yes, ma'am.
- Daisy, visit with Ms. Shihab.

04:21.665 --> 04:23.132
Tell her that the United States is appalled

04:23.133 --> 04:24.333
by the way she was treated.

04:24.334 --> 04:26.001
Make sure she's getting anything she needs.

04:26.002 --> 04:26.902
Of course.

04:26.903 --> 04:28.104
And let's bring in DOJ.

04:28.105 --> 04:29.739
I want to give them our blessing

04:29.740 --> 04:32.975
to pursue a full no-holds-barred
criminal investigation.

04:32.976 --> 04:35.011
How do we do that with
the Hassanis holed up

04:35.012 --> 04:36.279
at the Not OK Corral?

04:36.280 --> 04:39.815
Dispatch DS agents to the
embassy in case they move.

04:39.816 --> 04:41.217
Nothing conspicuous.

04:41.218 --> 04:43.319
I do not want to escalate.

04:43.320 --> 04:44.620
- They'll be discreet.
- All right,

04:44.621 --> 04:47.021
let's get to work.

04:54.431 --> 04:56.198
How may I direct your call?

04:56.199 --> 04:57.500
Agent Vasquez, please.

04:57.501 --> 05:00.535
Please hold.

05:24.960 --> 05:26.228
Vasquez.

05:26.229 --> 05:28.297
Uh, Secretary would like
a detail posted immediately

05:28.298 --> 05:29.565
to the Bahraini embassy.

05:29.566 --> 05:30.766
Yes, ma'am.

05:30.767 --> 05:34.603
Thank you.

05:34.604 --> 05:37.406
People were so poor

05:37.407 --> 05:40.276
that they fed their kids boot leather.

05:40.277 --> 05:42.278
No. N-No way.

05:42.279 --> 05:43.779
No, that's not real.

05:43.780 --> 05:45.081
Oh, yes, it is.

05:45.082 --> 05:47.483
Why do you think they called
it the Depression, dork?

05:47.484 --> 05:48.851
- Uh...
- I ate a boot.

05:48.852 --> 05:52.054
You bread it, you fry it, and
you put a little salt on it.

05:52.055 --> 05:53.622
Not too bad.

05:54.791 --> 05:56.359
Course, then, I only had one boot.

05:57.928 --> 06:00.563
Grandpa, I actually
believed you for a second.

06:00.564 --> 06:02.498
See? It sounds like it's going well.

06:02.499 --> 06:04.367
He's been holding court for an hour.

06:04.368 --> 06:06.402
What I'm getting at here...

06:06.403 --> 06:07.903
Just... it's just a few more days.

06:07.904 --> 06:10.639
Poor people were ripe for exploitation.

06:10.640 --> 06:12.675
Instead, Roosevelt passed

06:12.676 --> 06:14.610
the 40-hour, five-day work week.

06:14.611 --> 06:16.078
Someone should tell Mom.

06:16.079 --> 06:18.314
Har, har. I heard that, Ali.

06:18.315 --> 06:20.782
- Oh, Elizabeth.
- Hey, Pat.

06:21.384 --> 06:24.954
- Good to see you.
- Nice to see you.

06:24.955 --> 06:26.989
And not just because this probably means

06:26.990 --> 06:28.524
that the world is not burning.

06:28.525 --> 06:30.526
Well, I try to keep it at smoldering.

06:30.527 --> 06:31.694
Hi, sweetie.

06:31.695 --> 06:33.662
Nice place you got.

06:33.663 --> 06:35.231
- We like it.
- It's a little fancy

06:35.232 --> 06:37.533
for a civil servant, but then, you came

06:37.534 --> 06:39.168
from a horse farm.

06:39.169 --> 06:41.201
Certainly does smell
better here. It's true.

06:41.202 --> 06:42.071
Well, with D.C.

06:42.072 --> 06:43.739
politics, you must get your share of crap.

06:43.740 --> 06:45.341
She dishes out plenty, too.

06:45.342 --> 06:47.076
Welcome home, Stevie.

06:47.077 --> 06:48.277
I'm here to see Grandpa.

06:48.278 --> 06:49.412
Yeah, of course.

06:49.413 --> 06:50.780
I'm starving. Anybody else?

06:50.781 --> 06:53.114
- Let's eat. It's ready.
- God, let's do.

06:55.618 --> 06:58.020
He had to bring up the horse farm.

06:58.021 --> 07:00.289
So, we owned horses. People own horses.

07:00.290 --> 07:02.291
I just don't think that he imagined

07:02.292 --> 07:05.394
you were gonna marry someone
who grew up with them.

07:05.395 --> 07:06.996
But... so your parents did well.

07:06.997 --> 07:09.365
I don't understand what
the big deal is about.

07:09.366 --> 07:11.300
- Shh. Stop.
- Well, he's great with the kids.

07:11.301 --> 07:13.235
- I will give him that.
- Yes.

07:13.236 --> 07:16.539
So, I guess this is everything.

07:16.540 --> 07:18.040
Listen, you shouldn't be doing this.

07:18.041 --> 07:19.675
Pat, the kids should be on cleanup.

07:19.676 --> 07:20.943
- Thanks very much.
- Oh, no.

07:20.944 --> 07:22.711
I carry my own load, honey.

07:22.712 --> 07:26.649
So, big free-trade
negotiations going on, huh?

07:26.650 --> 07:27.950
Yeah, with Brazil.

07:27.951 --> 07:29.185
Well, maybe you can

07:29.186 --> 07:31.420
pull a few strings
for your father-in-law

07:31.421 --> 07:33.522
- and get me in the game.
- Really, Dad?

07:33.523 --> 07:35.291
You're just gonna go there?

07:35.292 --> 07:37.560
Foreign labor is a threat to my guys' jobs.

07:37.561 --> 07:39.562
Now, what kind of union rep would I be

07:39.563 --> 07:40.996
if I didn't get them heard?

07:40.997 --> 07:42.631
We haven't even had dessert yet.

07:42.632 --> 07:45.201
I take it you'd like to present
the steelworkers' interests?

07:45.202 --> 07:47.169
You know how these deals go.

07:47.170 --> 07:50.039
Giveaways to rich guys who can afford

07:50.040 --> 07:51.140
to pay fancy lobbyists.

07:51.141 --> 07:52.408
I'm sure there's someone at the union

07:52.409 --> 07:53.642
who's looking out for that.

07:53.643 --> 07:55.043
Yeah. Me.

07:56.512 --> 07:58.047
You know how I got a meeting

07:58.048 --> 08:00.381
with Reagan's secretary of labor?

08:00.883 --> 08:02.084
I figured out

08:02.085 --> 08:03.619
where he got his shoes polished,

08:03.620 --> 08:06.622
and then I cozied up to the shine guy,

08:06.623 --> 08:07.990
and I got his schedule.

08:07.991 --> 08:11.660
And then... I must have
had my shoes shined 50 times

08:11.661 --> 08:15.498
before I finally got the big boss alone,

08:15.499 --> 08:18.567
and he gave me five minutes for my boys.

08:18.568 --> 08:21.170
You don't think I'd
ask my daughter-in-law?

08:21.171 --> 08:23.571
Yeah, of course, you would.

08:26.342 --> 08:27.910
What is it with you, Henry?

08:27.911 --> 08:30.045
A man can't fight for what he believes in?

08:30.046 --> 08:31.981
Pat, it's fine. Don't even worry about it.

08:31.982 --> 08:33.616
I'll see what I can do.

08:33.616 --> 08:36.017
Thank you.

08:36.919 --> 08:39.388
So, what else can I do here?

08:39.389 --> 08:41.756
Bring this ice cream
to the table. Thank you.

08:41.758 --> 08:43.659
Yeah.

08:43.659 --> 08:46.328
It's the rum raisin that you like I got.

08:46.329 --> 08:48.264
I-I like the story about the shoeshine.

08:48.265 --> 08:49.565
I thought it was...

08:49.566 --> 08:51.166
Okay, just breathe, Henry.

08:51.167 --> 08:52.368
It's almost over.

08:53.803 --> 08:56.705
Metropolitan Police turned
those over to my team at DOJ.

08:56.706 --> 08:58.974
That's Kemala, and that's the boiler room

08:58.975 --> 09:00.109
they locked her in at night.

09:00.110 --> 09:02.344
There's more than enough to prosecute.

09:02.345 --> 09:04.246
- Well, then, let's get a warrant.
- We have one.

09:04.247 --> 09:07.349
But it's useless as long as
they're holed up in the embassy.

09:07.350 --> 09:10.953
Blake, will you get Matt and Daisy in here?

09:10.954 --> 09:13.989
These are heated-towel-rack
and turndown-service people.

09:13.990 --> 09:16.258
They're not gonna last a week
inside government quarters.

09:16.259 --> 09:19.028
Matt, write a memo demanding

09:19.029 --> 09:20.729
the Bahrainis accept our immunity waiver

09:20.730 --> 09:22.231
and release the Hassanis.

09:22.232 --> 09:23.866
- On it.
- You want me to put out a story?

09:23.867 --> 09:25.901
I mean, the media will have a field day.

09:25.902 --> 09:27.303
Do it. I'm tired of waiting for them

09:27.304 --> 09:28.737
to come out and see their shadow.

09:28.738 --> 09:30.439
A private flight out
of the Farnham airstrip

09:30.440 --> 09:32.074
was just chartered to Qatar.

09:32.075 --> 09:33.676
It's an all-Bahraini crew.

09:33.677 --> 09:35.811
- Leaves in an hour.
- Blake, get the DS agents on the phone.

09:35.812 --> 09:37.813
Tell them the Hassanis are making a move.

09:37.814 --> 09:39.982
They know we'll be looking at flights

09:39.983 --> 09:42.751
to Bahrain. Qatar is the
closest direct flight from D.C.

09:42.752 --> 09:44.719
And they don't have an
extradition agreement with us.

09:44.720 --> 09:46.789
A black Escalade just pulled
out of the Bahraini embassy.

09:46.790 --> 09:48.824
Okay, so tell the DS agents
to get in touch with the MPD.

09:48.825 --> 09:49.758
I want them intercepted.

09:49.759 --> 09:51.226
Ma'am, I must caution care

09:51.227 --> 09:52.595
when picking up the Hassanis.

09:52.596 --> 09:53.629
I agree.

09:53.630 --> 09:54.797
Our Gulf strategy relies

09:54.798 --> 09:55.998
on the base in Manama.

09:55.999 --> 09:58.567
Do we really want to risk
this thing blowing up?

09:58.568 --> 10:00.835
I'll take my chances.

10:02.838 --> 10:05.441
All units, subject C headed south.

10:27.196 --> 10:30.531
MPD! Step out of the car! Now, sir!

10:33.035 --> 10:34.236
Bilal Hassani

10:34.237 --> 10:36.805
and Zahra Hassani, you're under arrest

10:36.806 --> 10:40.274
for felony human trafficking
and false imprisonment.

10:41.644 --> 10:47.570
Subtitle sync and corrections
by awaqeded for www.addic7ed.com.

10:55.410 --> 10:57.550
MPD strip-searched the Hassanis?

10:57.551 --> 10:58.952
That's going to go over well.

10:58.953 --> 11:00.354
It's standard intake procedure.

11:00.355 --> 11:02.823
It doesn't matter. The
gaggle is gonna pounce.

11:02.824 --> 11:06.326
I assume that you're talking
about the strip search.

11:06.327 --> 11:07.795
It's standard intake procedure.

11:07.796 --> 11:10.364
Bahrain's gonna take
it as an affront, ma'am.

11:10.365 --> 11:12.466
I know, and that's unfortunate.

11:12.467 --> 11:14.368
But the Hassanis should
have thought of that

11:14.369 --> 11:16.403
before they took Ms. Shihab as their slave.

11:16.404 --> 11:18.005
Speaking of which, has Bahrain accepted

11:18.006 --> 11:19.406
our immunity waiver yet?

11:19.407 --> 11:20.941
They haven't rejected it.

11:20.942 --> 11:23.644
They're communicating their
displeasure in a different way.

11:23.645 --> 11:25.813
They're dispatching Crown Prince

11:25.814 --> 11:28.515
Yousif Obaid, King Naheen's eldest.

11:28.516 --> 11:30.818
He lands at Dulles in an hour.

11:30.819 --> 11:32.519
Great. Maybe he'll negotiate.

11:32.520 --> 11:35.556
Prince Yousif may be
Bahrain's great liberal hope,

11:35.557 --> 11:37.658
but I doubt he's coming to negotiate.

11:37.659 --> 11:39.293
Yeah, don't worry about it. I can take him.

11:39.294 --> 11:40.828
Madam Secretary, he
owns more than 100 homes,

11:40.829 --> 11:42.729
each built to his specifications.

11:42.730 --> 11:44.965
He has a fleet of special-edition yachts.

11:44.966 --> 11:46.366
When he feels like ordering a pizza,

11:46.367 --> 11:47.568
it gets flown in from Rome.

11:47.569 --> 11:49.670
The guy's used to getting his way.

11:49.671 --> 11:51.572
Well, that may be, but...

11:51.573 --> 11:54.640
I happen to know he's extremely ticklish.

11:55.409 --> 11:56.844
Wait, did the secretary just admit

11:56.845 --> 11:59.580
to intimate anatomical knowledge
of the prince of Bahrain?

11:59.581 --> 12:01.715
His CIA briefs must be detailed.

12:01.716 --> 12:03.584
Okay, turning to tomorrow...

12:03.585 --> 12:05.385
the winners of the State Department

12:05.386 --> 12:07.754
first grade essay contest are visiting,

12:07.755 --> 12:10.424
so please watch your language.

12:10.425 --> 12:13.560
And, also,

12:13.561 --> 12:16.430
a pen has been stolen from my desk.

12:16.431 --> 12:17.931
By one of you,

12:17.932 --> 12:21.134
- I presume.
- A pen?

12:21.135 --> 12:23.170
How do you know you just didn't lose it?

12:23.171 --> 12:24.805
Because I know.

12:24.806 --> 12:27.608
But how can you be sure?

12:27.609 --> 12:31.243
I did not lose it.

12:32.145 --> 12:34.348
- It was taken.
- Can I ask what the significance

12:34.349 --> 12:35.816
of this pen is?

12:35.817 --> 12:38.552
As long as it's on my
desk by 3:00 p.m. today,

12:38.553 --> 12:40.486
I'll ask no questions.

12:41.855 --> 12:43.490
Well, she definitely lost it,

12:43.491 --> 12:45.825
and I'm not talking about the pen.

12:48.128 --> 12:50.163
Admiral Hill.

12:50.164 --> 12:53.066
Somehow I'm not surprised
to see you stopping by.

12:53.067 --> 12:54.501
Good. Then you know I need you

12:54.502 --> 12:55.802
to release the Bahraini consular officer.

12:55.803 --> 12:57.771
That's a request for local authorities.

12:57.772 --> 12:59.907
Please don't be coy, Madam Secretary.

12:59.908 --> 13:01.406
We all know you're driving this train.

13:01.407 --> 13:03.377
Well, then you also know why

13:03.378 --> 13:05.879
I won't allow the Hassanis' release.

13:05.880 --> 13:08.482
I'm sure you're aware
of our base in Manama.

13:08.483 --> 13:12.286
I am highly sensitive to
our strategic post there.

13:12.287 --> 13:15.389
And also our billion-dollar renovation.

13:15.390 --> 13:17.357
It is the linchpin to
our defensive positions

13:17.358 --> 13:18.692
around Iraq and Iran.

13:18.693 --> 13:19.993
And I'm here to make sure

13:19.994 --> 13:21.795
that you don't flush that down the drain.

13:21.796 --> 13:23.697
I believe you.

13:23.698 --> 13:25.565
I also believe that the linchpin

13:25.566 --> 13:27.067
of our democracy is human rights.

13:27.068 --> 13:28.969
Can't really put a price on that.

13:28.970 --> 13:31.405
But I'm willing to defend it
over a military installation.

13:31.406 --> 13:33.707
If Bahrain retaliates, I'll
have to notify the president.

13:33.708 --> 13:35.842
- Understood.
- He won't appreciate being made

13:35.843 --> 13:37.411
to pick between State and Defense,

13:37.412 --> 13:38.812
but we both know which way he'll go.

13:38.813 --> 13:40.814
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

13:40.815 --> 13:43.983
But if it does, I'll see
you in the Oval Office.

13:52.159 --> 13:53.593
I'm sorry I'm not being more helpful.

13:53.594 --> 13:57.564
- Oh.
- This program just really isn't my jam.

13:57.565 --> 13:59.599
It's okay. It's okay.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.969
Meeting's not till tomorrow, anyway.

14:01.970 --> 14:05.738
And if this doesn't work
out, I got it all up here.

14:06.373 --> 14:07.674
That's annoying.

14:07.675 --> 14:08.909
I just...

14:08.910 --> 14:10.444
I can't get on to the FAQs

14:10.445 --> 14:13.513
because of Mom's uber-firewall. It...

14:13.514 --> 14:16.715
It's just something that I
don't miss about living here.

14:18.952 --> 14:21.587
What is it between you and your mom?

14:22.255 --> 14:23.822
Nothing.

14:24.725 --> 14:27.461
We have philosophical differences.

14:27.462 --> 14:31.431
And... I just can't get
on board with her side.

14:31.432 --> 14:33.834
So you took a stand.

14:33.835 --> 14:35.569
Good for you.

14:35.570 --> 14:36.903
You're my granddaughter.

14:36.904 --> 14:39.639
Yeah, well, taking a stand is what got me

14:39.640 --> 14:41.475
into this whole mess in the first place.

14:41.476 --> 14:43.777
- What mess?
- Being a college dropout.

14:43.778 --> 14:46.146
I mean, I screwed any chance that I have

14:46.147 --> 14:48.048
of actually getting a meaningful job.

14:48.049 --> 14:50.117
I didn't go to college,
and I'm on the board

14:50.118 --> 14:52.451
of the biggest union on the East Coast.

14:54.254 --> 14:56.423
Does the union have a D.C. chapter?

14:56.424 --> 14:58.091
You bet.

14:58.092 --> 14:59.693
Do you think I could work there

14:59.694 --> 15:02.029
organizing labor?

15:02.030 --> 15:04.831
Yeah.

15:04.832 --> 15:07.199
Yeah, I'll make a call.

15:08.568 --> 15:10.003
Ma'am,

15:10.004 --> 15:12.939
Crown Prince Obaid.

15:12.940 --> 15:14.241
Madam Secretary,

15:14.242 --> 15:16.109
you've detained a consular officer,

15:16.110 --> 15:17.344
and the Kingdom of Bahrain

15:17.345 --> 15:20.213
cannot abide such an action.

15:20.214 --> 15:23.216
Oh, my God, you sound so official, Joey.

15:23.217 --> 15:24.518
Please, Lizzie, it is Yousif.

15:24.519 --> 15:26.119
- Come here.
- No...

15:28.389 --> 15:31.525
We went to boarding school
together. Houghton Hall.

15:31.526 --> 15:33.860
We were co-captains of the debate team.

15:33.861 --> 15:35.595
Yes, although I think our most heated

15:35.596 --> 15:37.464
were on the roof of Sukaly Dorm.

15:37.465 --> 15:39.466
- Yes. Oh.
- Oh, we had big plans

15:39.467 --> 15:41.101
- to change the world, didn't we?
- We did.

15:41.102 --> 15:42.502
Okay, I will let you two catch up.

15:42.503 --> 15:43.737
- Yeah.
- How long has it been?

15:43.738 --> 15:46.640
- God.
- Well... Well, it's dinner

15:46.641 --> 15:48.341
at that pub in Kensington, I believe.

15:48.342 --> 15:50.610
Oh, that's right. And
little Stevie was so little.

15:50.611 --> 15:52.846
I had her in one of those slingy things.

15:52.847 --> 15:54.915
- Mm-hmm.
- How are you?

15:54.916 --> 15:58.585
Well, honestly, Lizzie, I'm
in a bit of a tight spot.

15:58.586 --> 16:00.921
I need you to release the Hassanis

16:00.922 --> 16:03.457
and reinstate full immunity immediately.

16:03.458 --> 16:05.959
Well, I can't reinstate what
they were never qualified for.

16:05.960 --> 16:07.294
They're Bahraini diplomats.

16:07.295 --> 16:09.896
They cannot be treated
like common criminals.

16:09.897 --> 16:11.431
Do you see how they treated their maid?

16:11.432 --> 16:13.800
It was despicable, but
this is an exceptional case.

16:13.801 --> 16:15.502
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

16:15.503 --> 16:16.937
Royal Decree 56?

16:16.938 --> 16:20.006
State officials in Bahrain
are immune from prosecution

16:20.007 --> 16:22.142
for human rights abuses.

16:22.143 --> 16:23.477
I don't need human rights pointers

16:23.478 --> 16:24.945
from a country that imprisons Arabs

16:24.946 --> 16:26.513
on an island without legal recourse.

16:26.514 --> 16:28.148
Okay, forget about Royal Decree 56.

16:28.149 --> 16:29.416
We're in the United States.

16:29.417 --> 16:31.952
The Hassanis broke over half a dozen laws,

16:31.953 --> 16:34.254
- and they're going to pay for it.
- Okay. Fine.

16:34.255 --> 16:36.022
Without immunity, your soldiers,

16:36.023 --> 16:39.059
your embassy employees may get
dragged before Bahraini judges

16:39.060 --> 16:40.460
just for annoying our government.

16:40.461 --> 16:42.195
Now, I know that's not a real threat.

16:42.196 --> 16:44.197
I am just saying I cannot guarantee

16:44.198 --> 16:45.432
there won't be consequences.

16:45.433 --> 16:47.567
Who's talking here,
Joey? You or your father?

16:47.568 --> 16:49.569
Come on, you used to

16:49.570 --> 16:52.072
rail against his conservative rule.

16:52.073 --> 16:53.507
I still maintain my own views.

16:53.508 --> 16:55.442
Then stand up to him.

16:55.443 --> 16:56.576
Hmm?

16:56.577 --> 17:00.379
Make him accept our immunity waiver.

17:01.615 --> 17:03.416
Fine. I will talk to him.

17:03.417 --> 17:06.653
Thank you. I know that's not easy.

17:06.654 --> 17:08.654
How is your father?

17:09.321 --> 17:10.824
He's old. He's sick.

17:10.825 --> 17:13.492
He's nearing the end of his life.

17:13.493 --> 17:16.429
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Mmm.

17:16.430 --> 17:19.299
I hope it's not true, but if it is,

17:19.300 --> 17:22.234
I take solace in the
fact that a progressive,

17:22.236 --> 17:25.704
bold new leader will take his place.

17:25.705 --> 17:27.507
- Hey.
- Hmm?

17:27.508 --> 17:29.809
Why don't you come over to
our house for dinner tonight?

17:29.810 --> 17:31.845
Come on, it'll be fun. We won't talk shop.

17:31.846 --> 17:34.314
I promise. I mean, the
food's gonna suck, but...

17:34.315 --> 17:36.583
Listen, I... You haven't even met...

17:36.584 --> 17:38.752
You haven't even met Alison and Jason.

17:38.753 --> 17:40.287
She's delicate

17:40.288 --> 17:42.556
and very confused.

17:42.557 --> 17:45.692
Well, given what she's
endured, I'm not surprised.

17:45.693 --> 17:47.060
She's afraid she'll be punished,

17:47.061 --> 17:49.495
and very worried about deportation.

17:50.864 --> 17:52.832
I'm very sorry about everything

17:52.833 --> 17:55.135
- that happened to you.
- Thank you.

17:55.136 --> 17:58.138
I want you to know that
we're doing everything we can

17:58.139 --> 18:00.807
to see that the Hassanis face justice.

18:00.808 --> 18:02.943
How is Mr. Hassani?

18:02.944 --> 18:04.811
And Mrs...

18:04.812 --> 18:06.279
Are they angry at me?

18:06.280 --> 18:08.315
I'm more concerned about you.

18:08.316 --> 18:09.516
How are you doing?

18:09.517 --> 18:12.818
Good. When can I work?

18:13.653 --> 18:15.422
I don't know.

18:15.423 --> 18:19.292
But I came here today
to tell you in person:

18:19.293 --> 18:22.027
I spoke with Prince Yousif about you.

18:23.563 --> 18:26.499
Prince Yousif? Why?

18:26.500 --> 18:28.702
Because he's very concerned about you, too.

18:28.703 --> 18:31.904
And he hopes that you feel better soon.

18:33.273 --> 18:36.209
I like Prince Yousif.

18:36.210 --> 18:38.143
He is good man.

18:39.279 --> 18:40.547
Yes.

18:40.548 --> 18:43.650
Yes, he is.

18:43.651 --> 18:45.485
Where are we now?

18:45.486 --> 18:47.287
We got them on felony human trafficking,

18:47.288 --> 18:48.755
unlawful holding of wages

18:48.756 --> 18:51.124
and false imprisonment,
among other charges.

18:51.125 --> 18:53.193
So how long would they go to prison?

18:53.194 --> 18:54.628
Ten to 20.

18:54.629 --> 18:56.730
Of course, this is all
pending Bahrain's agreement

18:56.731 --> 18:58.465
to State's immunity waiver request.

18:58.466 --> 19:01.134
Which I'm afraid did
not come through, ma'am.

19:01.135 --> 19:03.870
What? Prince Yousif assured me

19:03.871 --> 19:05.405
that he would speak with his father.

19:05.406 --> 19:06.706
Well, there's more.

19:06.707 --> 19:09.909
The Bahrainis promoted
Hassani to first secretary.

19:09.910 --> 19:11.044
Are you kidding me?

19:11.045 --> 19:12.879
I wish that I was. He's now at a level

19:12.880 --> 19:15.282
that automatically guarantees immunity.

19:15.283 --> 19:17.582
I have to let them go home.

19:30.408 --> 19:32.510
Your friend's here.

19:32.511 --> 19:34.479
Stevie, could you do me a favor

19:34.480 --> 19:36.581
and go help set the table, please?

19:36.582 --> 19:37.815
Yeah.

19:37.816 --> 19:41.486
Ah. Thank you.

19:41.487 --> 19:43.054
I can't believe how much she looks

19:43.055 --> 19:44.289
like you did in high school.

19:44.290 --> 19:47.125
Stevie and I share a lot.

19:47.126 --> 19:49.928
Including our outrage that I was forced

19:49.929 --> 19:52.497
to let a human rights abuser dodge justice.

19:52.498 --> 19:55.199
Okay, look, it's complicated.
My father's illness

19:55.200 --> 19:56.935
has destabilized my family's grip on power.

19:56.936 --> 19:58.436
The opposition parties would like

19:58.437 --> 20:01.406
nothing more than an
excuse to call for new rule.

20:01.407 --> 20:03.675
Oh, please.

20:03.676 --> 20:06.744
If you're gonna screw me,
at least have the respect

20:06.745 --> 20:09.380
of owning it without making excuses.

20:09.381 --> 20:10.715
I argued

20:10.716 --> 20:12.850
for a trial in America.

20:12.851 --> 20:14.285
My father convinced me that

20:14.286 --> 20:16.321
promoting Hassani would send a message

20:16.322 --> 20:18.356
to my people that I stand with Bahrain.

20:18.357 --> 20:19.457
And slavery.

20:19.458 --> 20:20.792
My hands are tied.

20:20.793 --> 20:22.694
My rivals circle my father's deathbed,

20:22.695 --> 20:24.062
just waiting for me to falter.

20:24.063 --> 20:26.764
And all the times that you
defended equality for women,

20:26.765 --> 20:30.301
and vowed to stop the
exploitation of the underclass?

20:30.302 --> 20:32.804
- We're not 17 anymore.
- Exactly.

20:32.805 --> 20:35.940
Now we are actually in a
position to effect change.

20:35.941 --> 20:37.442
Many people in my country

20:37.443 --> 20:39.210
loathe me for my Western education,

20:39.211 --> 20:42.647
- my progressive beliefs.
- And many more depend on you for them.

20:42.648 --> 20:46.284
You were going to change
things when you became king.

20:46.285 --> 20:47.552
And I will...

20:47.553 --> 20:50.455
change things when I become king.

20:50.456 --> 20:52.590
Just give me a chance to get there.

20:52.591 --> 20:56.060
Can I at least have your word

20:56.061 --> 20:59.129
that the Hassanis will
stand trial in Bahrain?

21:04.836 --> 21:08.071
Soup's on, everybody.

21:09.774 --> 21:12.276
Henry, you remember Yousif.

21:12.277 --> 21:13.778
- Yousif.
- Henry.

21:13.779 --> 21:15.246
So good to see you.

21:15.247 --> 21:17.215
Please, come in. This
is my father, Patrick.

21:17.216 --> 21:19.317
Ah. Yousif.

21:19.318 --> 21:22.253
A prince and a secretary of state.

21:22.254 --> 21:24.322
If Mom could see us now, huh?

21:24.323 --> 21:25.490
Please, sit.

21:25.491 --> 21:27.759
You met Stevie. This is Alison and Jason.

21:27.760 --> 21:28.509
Hi.

21:28.510 --> 21:30.661
Hi. Oh, uh, my mom here says
that you live in a palace

21:30.662 --> 21:32.330
with like, 200 bedrooms.

21:32.331 --> 21:33.364
Ah.

21:33.365 --> 21:35.099
How many bathrooms do you have?

21:35.100 --> 21:37.435
Well, not enough for my mother-in-law.

21:37.436 --> 21:38.936
Do you have any

21:38.937 --> 21:41.005
exotic pets, like an
albino lion or something?

21:41.006 --> 21:43.007
- Really, Alison?
- Uh...

21:43.008 --> 21:44.842
do my children count?

21:44.843 --> 21:45.843
Your slaves might.

21:45.844 --> 21:48.613
Dad. I'm sorry, Yousif.

21:48.614 --> 21:50.148
It's fine. I'm not so insulated

21:50.149 --> 21:51.716
that I'm unfamiliar with this critique.

21:51.717 --> 21:54.018
Ah, a man of the people.

21:54.019 --> 21:55.653
It's too bad your wealth

21:55.654 --> 21:58.456
is built on the backs of
the poor and oppressed.

21:58.457 --> 22:00.892
No wonder that diplomat treats his maid

22:00.893 --> 22:03.261
- like a slave.
- Pat, Yousif is our guest.

22:03.262 --> 22:05.396
No, Mom, he's right. How can you be friends

22:05.397 --> 22:07.098
with someone who condones
human trafficking?

22:07.099 --> 22:09.500
Okay, Stevie. Thanks, Dad. Thank you.

22:09.501 --> 22:11.335
I guess your moral compass
has always been broken.

22:11.336 --> 22:14.105
- Stop picking on Mom.
- I'm not trying to pick a fight with Mom.

22:14.106 --> 22:15.540
She's the one who...

22:21.447 --> 22:23.815
Enough.

22:23.816 --> 22:27.652
Not another word about this for
the rest of dinner. Am I clear?

22:27.653 --> 22:29.220
That goes for you, too, Dad.

22:29.221 --> 22:31.054
Yes, sir.

22:32.790 --> 22:35.225
Potato?

22:39.063 --> 22:41.065
So,

22:41.066 --> 22:42.834
I'm applying for a new job.

22:42.835 --> 22:45.536
Wow, there's something. What is it?

22:45.537 --> 22:48.405
Union organizing with Grandpa.

22:50.409 --> 22:52.742
Chip off the old block.

22:54.078 --> 22:56.447
I'm sorry that you're leaving tonight.

22:56.448 --> 22:59.117
Well, I need to get back.

22:59.118 --> 23:01.752
I'm not sorry about what I said.

23:01.753 --> 23:04.422
I mean, I just... didn't really expect

23:04.423 --> 23:07.592
everything to get so out of
control, you know? Stevie and...

23:07.593 --> 23:09.026
The young need to push the boundaries.

23:09.027 --> 23:10.628
It's good for them.

23:10.629 --> 23:13.698
Yeah, well, that's no
excuse for my father-in-law.

23:13.699 --> 23:17.735
Well, if he forgives
me, I will forgive him.

23:17.736 --> 23:21.738
Maybe it isn't just the young
who should push the boundaries.

23:23.307 --> 23:25.676
A little dissent is good,

23:25.677 --> 23:28.045
especially when it's standing
up for the right thing.

23:28.046 --> 23:29.881
Remember?

23:29.882 --> 23:31.649
You said that, Joey.

23:31.650 --> 23:34.852
The night before graduation
on the roof of Sukaly.

23:34.853 --> 23:36.921
You told me you weren't
gonna wear your mortarboard

23:36.922 --> 23:38.923
in the ceremony.

23:38.924 --> 23:40.958
I do remember thinking,

23:40.959 --> 23:44.095
if the future king of
Bahrain could say that,

23:44.096 --> 23:48.331
well, then anything is possible.

23:59.610 --> 24:03.012
Thank you for dinner, Lizzie.

24:31.676 --> 24:32.944
Hi.

24:32.945 --> 24:35.680
Uh, I was just passing by.

24:35.681 --> 24:37.548
Are you a steelworker?

24:37.549 --> 24:39.584
No, but my grandfather is.

24:39.585 --> 24:42.820
He said there might be an
entry-level organizing job.

24:42.821 --> 24:46.591
Love your enthusiasm, but
that job isn't open right now.

24:46.592 --> 24:48.593
Oh.

24:48.594 --> 24:51.329
Probably should have let him call first.

24:51.330 --> 24:53.064
What's your grandfather's name?

24:53.065 --> 24:55.533
Patrick McCord.

24:55.534 --> 24:58.402
Um, he's actually on the
board of the national chapter.

24:58.403 --> 24:59.503
McCord.

24:59.504 --> 25:02.139
M-C-C-O-R-D?

25:02.140 --> 25:05.076
Mm-hmm.

25:05.077 --> 25:08.378
I'm sorry, but he's not on our board.

25:09.013 --> 25:10.982
Are you sure?

25:10.983 --> 25:13.517
You checked the national
board, in Pittsburgh?

25:13.518 --> 25:16.254
Here's the number to the Pittsburgh office

25:16.255 --> 25:19.589
in case you want to check yourself.

25:20.224 --> 25:22.126
Thank you.

25:22.127 --> 25:24.095
Madam Secretary,

25:24.096 --> 25:25.830
meet the winners of the State Department

25:25.831 --> 25:27.298
first grade essay contest.

25:27.299 --> 25:30.901
Hi, kids. And justifiably proud parents.

25:30.902 --> 25:32.903
Now, listen, I read your essays

25:32.904 --> 25:35.339
on influential Americans abroad,

25:35.340 --> 25:37.408
and it made me very proud to be among them.

25:37.409 --> 25:39.677
- Hmm.
- You ready for your certificates?

25:39.678 --> 25:42.380
Okay. Here we go.

25:42.381 --> 25:44.215
Who's first up?

25:44.216 --> 25:46.751
Justin Lee.

25:46.752 --> 25:48.085
Thank you.

25:48.086 --> 25:49.987
You're very welcome.
Promise to keep writing?

25:49.988 --> 25:53.557
- You bet.
- There's your pen. All right.

25:53.558 --> 25:56.127
- And...
- Haven Costello.

25:56.128 --> 25:58.396
Haven... Ooh.

25:58.397 --> 26:00.698
Hold on one second.

26:00.699 --> 26:03.768
Technical difficulties. Hold on. Blake?

26:03.769 --> 26:05.569
- Yes.
- Do you have a pen?

26:05.570 --> 26:07.371
Uh, you know what, I can
run downstairs quickly.

26:07.372 --> 26:09.907
Oh, wait. No. Got it.

26:09.908 --> 26:12.943
Ooh, look at this. This is a NASA pen.

26:12.944 --> 26:17.248
Wow. Maybe this pen will inspire you

26:17.249 --> 26:20.384
to write about space. What do you think?

26:20.385 --> 26:22.652
Thank you, Madam Secretary.

26:26.290 --> 26:28.691
Hey, Dad.

26:29.727 --> 26:32.663
That meeting was a complete waste.

26:32.664 --> 26:35.866
Your wife stuck me with some... kid.

26:35.867 --> 26:37.968
Okay, hey. You're lucky that she stuck you

26:37.969 --> 26:40.404
- with anybody.
- 11 hours on that bus to get here.

26:40.405 --> 26:42.640
Oh, and here I thought
you came to see the family.

26:42.641 --> 26:45.409
40 years. I bring 40 years
of experience to bear,

26:45.410 --> 26:47.244
and she sticks me with a nobody.

26:47.245 --> 26:48.312
She did you a favor.

26:48.313 --> 26:50.614
She says she cares about workers like me.

26:50.615 --> 26:52.817
She's buddy-buddy with
some slave-owning prince!

26:52.818 --> 26:55.219
I'm surprised she didn't marry the prince

26:55.220 --> 26:59.824
and-and live in palaces
with all those bathrooms!

26:59.825 --> 27:01.992
Hey. Hey!

27:01.993 --> 27:04.128
- All right.
- At least Mom's

27:04.129 --> 27:04.761
not a fake.

27:04.762 --> 27:06.564
Stevie, this is between
your grandfather and me.

27:06.565 --> 27:09.033
No, it's not. Mom doesn't lie.

27:09.034 --> 27:12.536
She doesn't pretend to
be better than she is.

27:12.537 --> 27:14.939
And she faces up to the
things that she's done.

27:14.940 --> 27:16.640
- What are you even talking about?
- You.

27:16.641 --> 27:19.643
You're not on your union's board.

27:19.644 --> 27:23.848
You haven't been for five years. I checked.

27:23.849 --> 27:27.284
They said that you're hardly
even at the hall anymore.

27:27.285 --> 27:30.521
So, what exactly was your plan, Grandpa?

27:30.522 --> 27:32.123
Were you gonna pretend to help me

27:32.124 --> 27:33.724
and hope that maybe I would...

27:33.725 --> 27:36.894
forget that I needed a job while
you were getting my hopes up?

27:36.895 --> 27:39.029
You knew how much it meant to me,

27:39.030 --> 27:40.598
and-and now you're s...

27:40.599 --> 27:42.833
you're sitting here criticizing my mom.

27:42.834 --> 27:44.068
I don't have to answer to you.

27:44.069 --> 27:45.802
I don't have to answer to anyone.

27:48.873 --> 27:50.841
I owe you an apology, Kemala.

27:50.842 --> 27:53.177
I had to let the Hassanis go.

27:53.178 --> 27:55.179
They're on a plane back to Bahrain.

27:55.180 --> 27:57.915
They won't see justice as I had hoped.

27:57.916 --> 28:00.516
Mr. Hassani is important man.

28:02.553 --> 28:04.622
Well, speaking of important men,

28:04.623 --> 28:08.725
Prince Obaid has secured
reparations on your behalf.

28:09.860 --> 28:11.762
You'll have enough money.

28:11.763 --> 28:13.631
You won't have to worry about that.

28:13.632 --> 28:15.366
Daisy and I want to talk

28:15.367 --> 28:18.903
about your future. I can grant
you asylum in the United States.

28:18.904 --> 28:20.271
If you'd like.

28:20.272 --> 28:22.339
We can help set you up
here, find an apartment.

28:22.340 --> 28:23.674
Would you like that?

28:23.675 --> 28:24.809
Here?

28:24.810 --> 28:27.678
- Not necessarily in Washington.
- I know

28:27.679 --> 28:31.048
it's a lot, but it's a
chance for you to start over.

28:31.049 --> 28:32.983
If not,

28:32.984 --> 28:35.352
I'd have to send you back to Indonesia.

28:35.353 --> 28:36.487
No.

28:36.488 --> 28:38.289
No work there.

28:38.290 --> 28:41.325
Maybe you'd like to think about it.

28:41.326 --> 28:44.361
Mr. Hassani brother.

28:44.362 --> 28:45.763
He talk to me.

28:45.764 --> 28:47.465
He give work

28:47.466 --> 28:50.201
with him in Bahrain.

28:50.202 --> 28:51.936
Can I go?

28:51.937 --> 28:55.439
Yes, of course.

28:55.440 --> 28:58.075
It was her choice.

28:58.076 --> 29:00.511
I just wish her
circumstances had allowed her

29:00.512 --> 29:03.113
- to make a different one.
- You have to see this.

29:03.114 --> 29:04.548
They're live on Prince Yousif
announcing he's prosecuting

29:04.549 --> 29:05.916
the Hassanis in Bahrain.

29:05.917 --> 29:06.916
What?

29:06.917 --> 29:09.820
...and are being processed as I speak.

29:09.821 --> 29:11.789
Justice will be served.

29:15.293 --> 29:18.429
Now, to those countrymen who will reframe

29:18.430 --> 29:20.097
this course correction

29:20.098 --> 29:23.601
as dissent

29:23.602 --> 29:26.203
in my family, I say

29:26.204 --> 29:30.674
some dissent is good,

29:30.675 --> 29:34.111
especially when standing
up for the right reasons.

29:34.112 --> 29:36.447
I'm guessing your dinner had
something to do with this?

29:36.448 --> 29:40.251
Who knew my pot roast was that effective?

29:45.524 --> 29:46.490
Madam Secretary!

29:46.491 --> 29:47.825
What the hell?

30:13.951 --> 30:16.453
Madam Secretary,

30:16.454 --> 30:20.224
the funeral has been scheduled for tomorrow

30:20.225 --> 30:21.625
at 4:00 p.m. local time.

30:21.626 --> 30:22.993
You'll need to leave from Andrews

30:22.994 --> 30:24.627
by midnight tonight.

30:25.262 --> 30:27.398
Any news?

30:27.399 --> 30:29.800
Have they I.D.'d the gunman?

30:29.801 --> 30:32.836
He was a member of Al-Jinna,
a radical opposition party.

30:32.837 --> 30:35.639
Apparently, the text
of the speech was leaked

30:35.640 --> 30:38.609
- a few hours before the press conference.
- Ma'am,

30:38.610 --> 30:41.045
your request to participate
in the funeral has been denied.

30:41.046 --> 30:43.113
You'll have to stay in the back
of the mosque with the women,

30:43.114 --> 30:44.949
behind an opaque curtain.

30:44.950 --> 30:46.050
How does that work?

30:46.051 --> 30:47.751
Only men are allowed to participate

30:47.752 --> 30:49.119
- in the funeral procession.
- Ma'am,

30:49.120 --> 30:50.621
the image of the American

30:50.622 --> 30:53.457
secretary of state cloistered

30:53.458 --> 30:55.159
behind a curtain because she's a woman...

30:55.160 --> 30:57.995
You'd be allowing the Bahrainis
to undermine your authority

30:57.996 --> 31:00.164
as a representative of the United States.

31:00.165 --> 31:01.999
And as a woman.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.701
Maybe I shouldn't go.

31:03.702 --> 31:05.402
Boycott the funeral?

31:05.403 --> 31:07.972
I'd advise against that.
It could be interpreted

31:07.973 --> 31:10.140
as a critique of a whole
culture, not the event.

31:10.141 --> 31:12.176
You just said going would
undermine her position.

31:12.177 --> 31:13.911
Now staying home is a critique?
What are you advocating?

31:13.912 --> 31:16.246
I don't know yet. This is complicated.

31:16.247 --> 31:19.883
I'm not here to sit in
judgment of the Bahraini culture

31:19.884 --> 31:22.019
or change it. But it is my job

31:22.020 --> 31:26.423
to represent ours without
devaluing my office.

31:26.424 --> 31:28.158
Or gender.

31:28.159 --> 31:30.260
There's also the base to consider.

31:30.261 --> 31:32.529
According to DOD, the Bahrainis

31:32.530 --> 31:35.766
are already holding up
supply shipments to Manama.

31:35.767 --> 31:37.368
They're doing a full about-face.

31:37.369 --> 31:40.971
Whatever gains we thought
we made are through.

31:40.972 --> 31:46.709
But, ma'am, would you really
miss Prince Obaid's funeral?

32:07.151 --> 32:09.854
So you're not on the
board anymore. So what?

32:09.855 --> 32:12.789
Did you really need to lie
about it for all these years?

32:16.560 --> 32:19.296
- Dad, please talk to me.
- You don't know what it's like.

32:19.297 --> 32:21.399
Okay. So tell me.

32:21.400 --> 32:23.701
What? That I'm irrelevant?

32:23.702 --> 32:26.871
That I got kicked off the
board like an old piece of rust?

32:26.872 --> 32:29.306
Eh. You don't want to know about me anyway.

32:29.307 --> 32:30.775
You've got your own fancy life.

32:30.776 --> 32:34.145
Hey. Everything I have, I
worked for. And you know why?

32:34.146 --> 32:36.347
Because you taught me that.

32:36.348 --> 32:39.350
I saw you get up early in
the morning to go to the shop.

32:39.351 --> 32:42.018
I saw you come home late
from the union meetings.

32:42.653 --> 32:44.655
It made an impression.

32:44.656 --> 32:46.956
It still does.

32:50.895 --> 32:55.199
You better tell that Stevie
of yours to watch her attitude.

32:55.200 --> 32:58.668
She still looks up to you, you know.

32:59.270 --> 33:02.305
There's a lot to look up to.

33:07.445 --> 33:09.113
I want to go home.

33:09.114 --> 33:11.382
W... Dad. What? Don't go.

33:11.383 --> 33:12.650
- Just please stay.
- No, take me to the bus.

33:12.651 --> 33:14.118
The bus? Please,

33:14.119 --> 33:15.820
let me at least buy you a plane ticket.

33:15.821 --> 33:18.088
No, I'm not gonna have you spring for an...

33:18.089 --> 33:20.757
airplane ticket for the poor old man.

33:22.493 --> 33:25.496
All right.

33:25.497 --> 33:28.865
I'll take you to the bus.

33:37.975 --> 33:40.476
Hello?

33:44.548 --> 33:46.816
- Hi.
- Hi, Mom.

33:47.751 --> 33:49.687
I'm sorry about Yousif.

33:49.688 --> 33:52.456
- Thank you.
- I can't believe it; he was just here.

33:52.457 --> 33:54.225
Mmm.

33:54.226 --> 33:55.693
He was cool.

33:55.694 --> 33:57.161
He was cool.

33:57.162 --> 33:59.230
It's kind of weird that he's dead.

33:59.231 --> 34:01.065
Seriously?

34:01.066 --> 34:03.132
It is weird.

34:04.435 --> 34:06.504
If I do go, some people are gonna think

34:06.505 --> 34:09.106
that the United States is
officially condoning patriarchy.

34:09.107 --> 34:10.341
If I don't go,

34:10.342 --> 34:12.176
then I'm skipping my friend's funeral.

34:12.177 --> 34:14.210
It's just, the whole
thing, it's impossible.

34:14.212 --> 34:16.714
"Say your prayers standing,
but if you are unable, sitting;

34:16.715 --> 34:18.716
and if unable, on your sides."

34:18.717 --> 34:20.484
Okay, a little help interpreting that?

34:20.485 --> 34:22.253
I have no idea what that means.

34:22.254 --> 34:23.954
It means that you can honor Yousif

34:23.955 --> 34:25.322
even if you decide not to go.

34:25.322 --> 34:27.992
- Says who?
- Uh, the prophet Mohammed.

34:29.661 --> 34:32.530
The Bahrainis are already
holding up body armor shipments

34:32.531 --> 34:35.032
for thousands of American soldiers.

34:35.033 --> 34:36.900
I mean, who knows how far they'll go

34:36.902 --> 34:39.737
- if they think that I'm humiliating them.
- Hey, hey, hey.

34:39.737 --> 34:41.105
Just relax.

34:41.106 --> 34:43.139
Come on, close your eyes.

34:43.141 --> 34:45.743
Just forget all of these arguments.

34:45.744 --> 34:47.110
Forget everything.

34:47.112 --> 34:49.480
What do you feel in your heart?

34:51.382 --> 34:53.951
He's my friend. I want to go.

34:53.952 --> 34:55.452
Then go.

34:55.453 --> 34:58.222
But isn't it selfish of
me to put my personal needs

34:58.223 --> 34:59.590
over the duties of my position?

34:59.591 --> 35:00.925
Would you give yourself a pass?

35:00.926 --> 35:02.860
I'm the one who convinced Joey

35:02.861 --> 35:04.695
to come out against the Hassanis.

35:04.696 --> 35:07.197
I knew that his enemies
were sharpening their knives.

35:07.198 --> 35:09.600
- Do I get a pass on that, too?
- Yes.

35:09.601 --> 35:11.135
Joey was murdered by a madman.

35:11.136 --> 35:12.703
Well, they need provocation, too.

35:12.704 --> 35:15.539
Look, you pushed him to do
what was right... that's what he

35:15.540 --> 35:16.671
loved about you.

35:16.672 --> 35:20.344
Yes, and if I hadn't, then
he might still be alive!

35:20.345 --> 35:23.213
"Friendship that insists
upon agreement on all things

35:23.214 --> 35:25.816
isn't worth the name."

35:25.817 --> 35:27.351
That's Gandhi.

35:27.352 --> 35:30.187
Okay, that one I get.

35:30.188 --> 35:32.222
Thank you.

35:34.693 --> 35:36.527
But Gandhi doesn't have to pick

35:36.528 --> 35:40.129
between his country and his
friend within the next hour.

35:42.967 --> 35:45.703
She's cutting it kind of close, huh?

35:45.704 --> 35:47.304
Oh, give her a break.

35:47.305 --> 35:49.239
Her friend died. Not to mention

35:49.240 --> 35:52.109
the security of the Middle
East hangs in the balance.

35:52.110 --> 35:54.845
Well, if we leave here
within the next 30 minutes,

35:54.846 --> 35:56.280
we can still make it.

35:56.281 --> 35:58.749
The secretary is on her way to Andrews.

35:58.750 --> 36:00.217
All right, let's rock and roll!

36:00.218 --> 36:02.286
No, no. She's going.

36:02.287 --> 36:04.921
We are not.

36:17.301 --> 36:20.037
Thank you for arranging this last-minute.

36:20.038 --> 36:22.206
The funeral is starting shortly.

36:22.207 --> 36:25.107
You have just a few minutes.

36:29.480 --> 36:31.948
Thank you, Frank.

36:32.716 --> 36:36.186
King Naheen, Your Majesty,

36:36.187 --> 36:39.023
I'm so very sorry for your loss.

36:39.024 --> 36:42.292
Thank you for coming, Secretary McCord.

36:42.293 --> 36:46.230
Please, I'm not here in
any official capacity.

36:46.231 --> 36:50.467
I came to pay my respects to you.

36:50.468 --> 36:52.903
Today I'm just Lizzie.

36:52.904 --> 36:54.505
Yes.

36:54.506 --> 36:57.907
Yousif's friend from Houghton.

36:59.410 --> 37:02.379
He spoke highly of you.

37:04.883 --> 37:09.552
I cared very deeply for your son.

37:14.391 --> 37:18.561
How did it... come to this?

37:20.531 --> 37:24.535
He was always trying to
convince you of something.

37:24.536 --> 37:26.437
Always...

37:26.438 --> 37:29.939
an argument.

37:30.741 --> 37:35.344
I would give anything
to argue with him again.

37:36.346 --> 37:38.547
Me, too.

37:49.310 --> 37:51.479
Surprise.

37:51.480 --> 37:55.550
Glenn. I wasn't expecting
you until tonight.

37:55.551 --> 37:57.757
I know we're keeping things hush-hush,

37:57.758 --> 38:00.158
but I had a meeting downstairs
about the lease renewal

38:00.159 --> 38:01.526
over the International Space Station.

38:01.527 --> 38:03.161
I couldn't help myself.

38:03.162 --> 38:04.429
Uh-huh.

38:04.430 --> 38:06.264
Bad move, huh?

38:06.265 --> 38:08.299
Uh, hey, if anyone asks,

38:08.300 --> 38:11.569
you could say I came
about the Nauru telescope.

38:11.570 --> 38:13.338
I lost the pen you gave me.

38:13.339 --> 38:15.774
I'm so sorry.

38:15.775 --> 38:17.308
It was such

38:17.309 --> 38:18.643
a thoughtful gift, and I...

38:18.644 --> 38:20.712
- I'm so sorry.
- Hey, hey, hey.

38:20.713 --> 38:22.781
Don't beat yourself up about one pen.

38:22.782 --> 38:25.717
- I've got 50 more at work.
- You do?

38:25.718 --> 38:28.253
You have no idea how much
writing gets done in space.

38:28.254 --> 38:31.923
People get very poetic up there.

38:31.924 --> 38:34.459
I'll bring you another
pen tonight, I promise.

38:36.062 --> 38:37.529
Okay.

38:37.530 --> 38:40.564
Well, thank you.

38:41.199 --> 38:43.500
Um...

38:44.969 --> 38:47.671
I have to tell you something.

38:51.009 --> 38:52.544
Tell me.

38:52.545 --> 38:55.113
For the last six years,

38:55.114 --> 38:57.382
I was in a relationship...

38:57.383 --> 38:59.217
with a married man.

38:59.218 --> 39:01.352
I am very...

39:01.353 --> 39:03.088
very ashamed

39:03.089 --> 39:05.890
of myself.

39:05.891 --> 39:08.525
I appreciate you sharing.

39:10.061 --> 39:11.463
But...

39:11.464 --> 39:13.398
I don't care.

39:13.399 --> 39:15.432
Really?

39:16.067 --> 39:18.736
We're both grown-ups.

39:18.737 --> 39:21.372
I've got my stuff, too.

39:21.373 --> 39:24.542
I know it's not obvious, since I'm...

39:24.543 --> 39:26.010
such a Casanova,

39:26.011 --> 39:27.912
but... I'm not that used

39:27.913 --> 39:30.648
to relationships.

39:30.649 --> 39:32.150
You know?

39:32.151 --> 39:34.519
I'm so obsessed with stuff
that's light-years away,

39:34.520 --> 39:37.555
I sometimes lose sight of
the beauty and the wonder

39:37.556 --> 39:39.323
right here on Earth.

39:56.808 --> 39:58.109
I saw nothing.

39:58.110 --> 40:01.411
Tell whoever you want.

40:02.647 --> 40:05.683
You'll never guess who Nadine is dating.

40:05.684 --> 40:06.851
Oh, oh, my God, who?

40:06.852 --> 40:08.419
- Madam Secretary.
- Hello, Madam Secretary.

40:08.420 --> 40:10.121
- Madam Secretary.
- Madam Secretary.

40:10.122 --> 40:11.556
Welcome back.

40:11.557 --> 40:12.891
Thank you.

40:12.892 --> 40:14.692
How was your trip?

40:14.693 --> 40:16.728
Well, it was a lot of flying.

40:16.729 --> 40:18.329
But I'm glad I went.

40:18.330 --> 40:20.498
Uh, Admiral Hill asked to see you

40:20.499 --> 40:22.966
as soon as you got back.

40:25.637 --> 40:27.270
Hey.

40:35.046 --> 40:37.515
Madam Secretary.

40:37.516 --> 40:39.717
Admiral Hill.

40:39.718 --> 40:42.320
If you're here to torment
me over my decision,

40:42.321 --> 40:44.556
you're too late... I beat you to it.

40:44.557 --> 40:47.058
I understand Prince Yousif was your friend.

40:47.059 --> 40:49.726
Please accept my condolences.

40:50.361 --> 40:52.163
Thank you.

40:52.164 --> 40:53.831
My fellow chiefs thought it was a bad call

40:53.832 --> 40:55.366
that you chose not to attend the funeral.

40:55.367 --> 40:56.834
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

40:56.835 --> 40:59.771
Then again, I don't think any of them

40:59.772 --> 41:03.107
have ever sat in a staff meeting
and had their ideas undermined

41:03.108 --> 41:05.443
by male subordinates to their face.

41:05.444 --> 41:07.712
Well, I'm not military, but...

41:07.713 --> 41:09.113
I don't think that's how

41:09.114 --> 41:11.082
chains of command are supposed to work.

41:12.218 --> 41:14.519
Well, I'm in charge now, and...

41:14.520 --> 41:16.955
I think you made the
right call to not attend.

41:16.956 --> 41:18.957
What about the base at Manama?

41:18.958 --> 41:21.226
The Bahrainis have started allowing

41:21.227 --> 41:22.860
their shipments through again.

41:22.861 --> 41:23.828
I don't know what

41:23.829 --> 41:25.096
you did over there, but it worked.

41:25.097 --> 41:27.699
I'm glad to hear it.

41:27.700 --> 41:29.200
As...

41:29.201 --> 41:31.502
chairwoman of the Joint Chiefs,

41:31.503 --> 41:34.272
I have to speak for all the chiefs.

41:34.273 --> 41:37.709
That can cause me to adopt a...

41:37.710 --> 41:41.446
a slightly different tone.

41:41.447 --> 41:44.482
This is what I sound like
when I speak for myself.

41:44.483 --> 41:46.349
I like this one better.

41:47.986 --> 41:51.155
I'll enjoy it while it lasts.

41:55.026 --> 41:57.328
Mike, just right there would be great.

41:57.329 --> 41:58.529
Thank you.

41:58.530 --> 42:01.364
- Hey. You're home early.
- Hi.

42:04.302 --> 42:07.137
Yeah. Slow day at the office.

42:08.640 --> 42:10.141
I saw a little bit

42:10.142 --> 42:12.377
of the funeral on TV.

42:12.378 --> 42:13.745
Me, too.

42:13.746 --> 42:14.846
How was the king?

42:14.847 --> 42:17.415
Sad.

42:17.416 --> 42:20.451
I felt bad getting back on my plane,

42:20.452 --> 42:22.587
you know, but...

42:22.588 --> 42:23.955
I'm glad I went. I...

42:23.956 --> 42:25.789
I think I did the right thing.

42:28.293 --> 42:29.694
Hey, Mom.

42:29.695 --> 42:31.429
Hi.

42:31.430 --> 42:32.730
I watched the funeral.

42:32.731 --> 42:34.599
Saw that you weren't there.

42:34.600 --> 42:35.933
Really?

42:35.934 --> 42:38.870
My friend Hannah was... impressed.

42:38.871 --> 42:41.839
Hannah was impressed. Okay.

42:41.840 --> 42:43.807
I was pretty proud.

42:44.442 --> 42:45.777
Also,

42:45.778 --> 42:49.312
I realized something.

42:50.248 --> 42:53.985
I need to stop defining
you by your worst moments.

42:53.986 --> 42:56.521
It's like you said when I left, you know...

42:56.522 --> 42:58.923
life is complicated, and...

42:58.924 --> 43:02.160
I can hate some things you've done, but...

43:02.161 --> 43:05.362
I can still respect
you for everything else.

43:05.963 --> 43:08.266
Stevie, that means so much to me.

43:08.267 --> 43:10.535
- I...
- Also,

43:10.536 --> 43:12.570
if it's cool with you guys,

43:12.571 --> 43:16.706
I was thinking about moving
back home for a while.
