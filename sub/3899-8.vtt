01:23.548 --> 01:25.008
- Okay, hold it steady?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:25.009 --> 01:26.092
- Like this?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:26.093 --> 01:27.176
Where do I cut it?

01:27.177 --> 01:29.595
_

01:29.596 --> 01:31.130
[speaking English] Okay, fine.

01:31.723 --> 01:33.091
[both exclaim]

01:34.018 --> 01:35.927
Beef Wellington.

01:37.437 --> 01:39.188
- What's this stuff?
- Snow peas.

01:39.189 --> 01:42.233
Nah, uh-uh. Peas...
Peas are round and green.

01:42.234 --> 01:45.569
- This is like a watery brown paste.
- The bag said "snow peas."

01:45.570 --> 01:47.522
Bag?

01:49.074 --> 01:50.908
I'm sure it tastes good.

01:50.909 --> 01:55.163
[woman on PA] Don't forget, ladies,
your usual meal is 1,500 calories.

01:55.164 --> 01:57.241
Beware of overeating.

02:00.960 --> 02:03.622
Well, this is disappointing.

02:04.298 --> 02:08.592
Oh! You've got the poulet à la crème.

02:08.592 --> 02:12.138
I didn't know what that
was. And... I still don't.

02:12.139 --> 02:15.058
It's chicken in white sauce.

02:15.059 --> 02:18.394
They should call it creamy meat
gruel and not get our hopes up.

02:18.395 --> 02:21.647
[sighing] Well, I guess this
is the new way of things.

02:21.648 --> 02:23.107
That's too bad.

02:23.108 --> 02:27.103
I really liked eating. It
was part of my daily routine.

02:29.281 --> 02:31.065
What is that?

02:32.451 --> 02:35.453
Shana Tova and Hava Nagila.

02:35.454 --> 02:36.745
Hmm?

02:36.746 --> 02:38.289
Mmm-mmm-mmm!

02:38.290 --> 02:39.832
It is good to be chosen.

02:39.833 --> 02:41.792
You have to be Jewish to get those.

02:41.793 --> 02:45.003
- They're Jewish?
- For this meal, they are.

02:45.004 --> 02:46.248
Huh.

02:47.174 --> 02:49.717
My Ralph is Jewish.

02:49.718 --> 02:52.511
I guess if I marry him,
I will be Jewish, too.
