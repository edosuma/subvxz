"THE TIGER"

00:15.440 --> 00:17.000
LUÍSA PAIXÃO 1944-2020
"THE RAY"

00:17.080 --> 00:19.320
<i>The funeral home</i>
<i>was wrong until the end, weren't they?</i>

00:20.160 --> 00:21.480
<i>I actually find it funny.</i>

00:23.000 --> 00:25.800
<i>He was the tiger, she was the ray.</i>

00:27.720 --> 00:28.680
<i>Exactly.</i>

00:30.080 --> 00:32.760
<i>Two animals that never met in nature.</i>

00:32.840 --> 00:37.520
<i>Never, under any circumstances,</i>
<i>has a tiger met a ray in the wild.</i>

00:47.840 --> 00:50.120
Do you think Mom liked me or you best?

00:50.800 --> 00:54.240
-What kind of a question is that?
-I've always wondered that.

00:54.320 --> 00:56.200
-She liked you best.
-She liked you best.

00:59.600 --> 01:02.400
Mom, we want to ask you something.

01:02.480 --> 01:03.880
Hey, Natália… Come on.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Tell us.

01:08.480 --> 01:10.320
Which one of us did you like best?

01:16.240 --> 01:20.440
"Natália…"

01:29.200 --> 01:31.480
Your grandson will be named João.

01:33.560 --> 01:35.960
Like Grandpa João,
who you talked about so much.

01:36.040 --> 01:37.600
Grandpa João, the smuggler?

01:38.600 --> 01:43.560
The one who snuck around Galicia
smuggling cigarettes and Ray-Bans?

01:51.520 --> 01:53.160
It was all so quick, wasn't it?

01:56.320 --> 01:58.080
First Dad, then Mom right after.

02:06.040 --> 02:10.280
As if they were… genuinely inseparable.

02:13.800 --> 02:17.240
One stops breathing,
the other doesn't survive long,

02:18.880 --> 02:21.320
as if they couldn't really live
without each other.

02:24.440 --> 02:26.240
Everything has an expiration date.

02:27.520 --> 02:30.760
Mom, Dad, me.

02:31.800 --> 02:32.880
You.

02:35.600 --> 02:38.960
This planet has an expiration date.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Right?

02:51.400 --> 02:52.400
Bye, Ray.

02:55.560 --> 02:56.560
Bye, Tiger.

03:09.880 --> 03:11.560
I'm already trying, you know?

03:12.200 --> 03:16.200
I'm really trying,
with all the strength I have left in me.

03:16.280 --> 03:17.720
You're trying what?

03:17.800 --> 03:21.280
I'm trying to do what's best for everyone.

03:22.320 --> 03:24.520
For Rita, for Marco, for Daniel.

03:24.600 --> 03:29.160
But maybe you're not supposed
to push so hard or try so much.

03:29.240 --> 03:31.720
No one can stand
on that pedestal their whole life.

03:31.800 --> 03:34.040
Now you'll tell me
that I deserve to be happy?

03:34.120 --> 03:34.960
It's not that--

03:35.040 --> 03:38.120
People deserve to be happy
as much as they deserve to die.

03:38.200 --> 03:39.160
It's random.

03:40.760 --> 03:43.120
Now you'll say
I have to think more about myself.

03:43.200 --> 03:46.800
If I could, I'd be on the other side
of the world, a backpack on my back.

03:46.880 --> 03:48.240
I'd be far from here.

03:48.320 --> 03:51.880
So my happiness
is probably not that important.

03:52.880 --> 03:55.640
Because I don't do what I want,
I do what I can.

03:57.200 --> 04:00.400
Daniel and I are not Tiger and Ray.

04:01.640 --> 04:04.520
We're two little mice
locked inside a cage,

04:04.600 --> 04:06.960
trying to figure the way out.

04:07.040 --> 04:09.360
-Sis--
-I don't have your courage.

04:10.080 --> 04:13.560
I don't. I can't change my life so easily.

04:14.280 --> 04:17.680
I think I'm like Dad.
I'm stubborn. I'm afraid.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.200
-I'm afraid, sis.
-Me too.

04:20.280 --> 04:23.120
Please take me to the hospital.
I can't take it anymore.

04:55.920 --> 04:57.240
What is it now?

05:00.800 --> 05:05.040
MARIA JOÃO
ONLY IF YOU'RE ALREADY SEPARATED

05:22.280 --> 05:23.320
Dad!

05:24.320 --> 05:25.760
-Dad!
-What?

05:25.840 --> 05:27.880
You must come now! Emergency!

05:27.960 --> 05:31.240
I'm not a wedding photographer!

05:31.320 --> 05:35.240
Okay? I never wanted to be a
wedding photographer, and I never will be!

05:35.320 --> 05:36.840
Is this how it's gonna be now?

05:40.880 --> 05:44.840
Stop! Before it's too late.
Love, the brigand, lies in wait.

05:45.680 --> 05:46.840
What's going on?

05:48.000 --> 05:49.360
Nothing is going on.

05:49.440 --> 05:53.320
No matter what it is,
you have to come now. Come on!

05:53.400 --> 05:55.280
-What happened?
-Come on!

06:00.200 --> 06:05.640
TIME MOVES FORWARD
AND DEATH GETS CLOSER

06:05.720 --> 06:07.960
The problem is, I'm low on battery charge.

06:08.040 --> 06:09.000
No!

06:09.080 --> 06:11.520
I'm… I'm talking to you!

06:13.880 --> 06:14.920
Open the door.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.560
They're spaced out, right?
See you. We're on our way.

06:18.640 --> 06:19.640
We're going.

06:21.240 --> 06:23.640
-Where's your cell phone?
-My cell phone?

06:24.600 --> 06:25.600
Keep calm.

06:25.680 --> 06:26.880
Here.

06:29.760 --> 06:33.840
Yes, but if you prefer
some place in particular, you can book it.

06:33.920 --> 06:36.120
We always offer
this package with a florist.

06:36.200 --> 06:39.040
She just took the epidural,
so it's going to be a while.

06:40.080 --> 06:43.880
-Where is Alexandre?
-It's "Sandro," Dad.

06:44.560 --> 06:45.520
"Sandro."

06:45.600 --> 06:47.400
-"Sandro."
-Alexandre…

06:48.640 --> 06:51.360
-Francisco is on his way.
-Francisco…

06:51.440 --> 06:53.760
Rita!

06:53.840 --> 06:58.320
-Give me a minute.
-I need you to go and get the car…

06:59.120 --> 07:01.640
Can you talk to my parents
about the flower arrangements?

07:01.720 --> 07:04.240
They're the owners of the company.
Thank you.

07:06.280 --> 07:08.600
-This too?
-Easy!

07:10.200 --> 07:13.560
Good morning. Am I talking to…

08:10.600 --> 08:12.840
Thanks for helping me with the car.

08:13.560 --> 08:14.560
You're welcome.

08:17.720 --> 08:20.000
Are you sleeping
in the office again tonight?

08:22.680 --> 08:25.440
-What are the rules?
-The rules?

08:26.760 --> 08:27.920
Yes.

08:29.200 --> 08:32.320
What are the rules about whether
I have to sleep in the office

08:32.400 --> 08:35.800
or whether I can consider
the privilege of sleeping with you?

08:35.880 --> 08:37.200
There are no rules.

08:38.080 --> 08:41.960
But I thought we had a deal.
That we were giving it a try.

08:42.040 --> 08:46.640
Yeah, except it's been what?
Six months? Seven?

08:47.640 --> 08:48.760
I don't know anymore.

08:51.240 --> 08:52.720
My parents died, Daniel.

08:54.880 --> 08:57.560
They both died. Almost at the same time.

08:58.840 --> 09:02.280
I still think about them every day.
I need to grieve.

09:02.360 --> 09:04.560
I think it's selfish of you--

09:04.640 --> 09:07.480
Do you know what this is?

09:11.640 --> 09:16.200
That's a sentence I was going
to include in my first exhibition.

09:16.280 --> 09:20.080
The one with the picture
I took at the apartment in Mercês.

09:20.760 --> 09:21.760
But…

09:23.520 --> 09:25.360
there was never any exhibition.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.840
Instead, we got married,
and I started shooting weddings.

09:33.240 --> 09:37.080
-Are you blaming me for this?
-No.

09:37.160 --> 09:40.080
I'm blaming myself,
for falling into the trap again,

09:40.160 --> 09:42.600
for believing you,
that you wanted a second chance.

09:42.680 --> 09:45.320
I wanted it. I swear I did.

09:46.520 --> 09:50.000
Or I thought I did.
I don't know. It's all so confusing.

09:56.600 --> 10:00.360
I'd love to tell you where we are,
but I don't know either.

10:01.280 --> 10:02.280
So?

10:03.280 --> 10:04.840
You put me on standby mode?

10:05.760 --> 10:06.840
You postpone me?

10:07.840 --> 10:10.080
That's a little selfish of you, isn't it?

10:10.160 --> 10:13.720
Because while you were grieving
for your parents' death,

10:13.800 --> 10:16.480
I was grieving for our relationship.

10:17.320 --> 10:18.320
Alone.

10:19.640 --> 10:21.040
Shit!

10:21.120 --> 10:22.720
Daniel…

10:32.640 --> 10:33.840
Are you okay?

10:36.680 --> 10:38.320
I'm going out with someone else.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.600
I'm sick! I'm sick of it!

10:50.320 --> 10:52.520
I'm sick of it!

11:00.680 --> 11:03.880
<i>-It's not worth it, my dear.</i>
<i>-What's not worth it?</i>

11:05.440 --> 11:06.840
<i>For you to jump from there.</i>

11:07.320 --> 11:09.080
<i>You'll end up in the</i> Star Wars <i>galaxy</i>

11:09.160 --> 11:12.280
<i>and then you'll have</i>
<i>to put up with that boring, clumsy robot.</i>

11:13.720 --> 11:16.440
<i>Have you seen an accountant around?</i>

11:17.640 --> 11:21.400
<i>No. It's been a bit strange lately.</i>
<i>New people every day.</i>

11:23.800 --> 11:26.240
<i>Do you want to see something cool?</i>

12:28.320 --> 12:30.880
I didn't think this existed anymore.

12:30.960 --> 12:34.400
Of course it exists.
But in another time and dimension.

12:35.720 --> 12:36.680
Pay attention.

12:39.280 --> 12:41.520
I'll tell you a secret about existence.

12:42.880 --> 12:44.000
Are you ready?

12:46.080 --> 12:47.040
I think so.

12:55.880 --> 12:57.200
Who are these people?

12:57.920 --> 12:59.480
They're your grandparents.

13:01.560 --> 13:02.720
Wow.

13:05.520 --> 13:06.680
They were beautiful.

13:09.920 --> 13:11.160
And your parents.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.440
My dad's always been
a shitty dancer, poor thing.

13:24.840 --> 13:26.840
Your mother. You.

13:30.640 --> 13:31.800
Your sister.

13:51.680 --> 13:53.640
One day, all of this will disappear.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.720
In life, nothing lasts.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.720
As someone once said,

14:03.200 --> 14:04.720
"Time moves forward…

14:06.880 --> 14:08.280
and death gets closer."

14:14.720 --> 14:17.040
Everything has a beginning and an end.

14:32.320 --> 14:34.080
The secret, my dear Marco,

14:34.160 --> 14:38.920
is to look into this nameless abyss
and continue to smile.

16:01.440 --> 16:03.000
I think it's broken for good.

16:03.840 --> 16:06.320
It's not the only thing
that's broken around here.

16:08.640 --> 16:12.880
-That looks like <i>The Last Picture Show.</i>
-Isn't that the name of a movie?

16:13.680 --> 16:18.160
Yep. 1971, Peter Bogdanovich's.

16:19.840 --> 16:25.400
With Cybill Shepherd, Jeff Bridges,
and the long-forgotten Timothy Bottoms.

16:25.480 --> 16:27.760
118 minutes, black and white.

16:27.840 --> 16:28.800
What's it about?

16:30.640 --> 16:34.880
I was going to say it's about the end,
but it's not exactly about the end.

16:35.680 --> 16:36.880
What then?

16:36.960 --> 16:40.600
It's about two friends
in a decrepit little town in Texas.

16:40.680 --> 16:43.640
One of them likes the girl dating
his friend, who's sent to the Korean War,

16:43.720 --> 16:48.200
while the first guy starts a relationship
with a melancholy older woman.

16:48.280 --> 16:49.920
And in the end,

16:50.000 --> 16:54.640
the only theater in town shows its
last movie before closing for good.

16:54.720 --> 16:56.600
The last decrepit picture show.

16:58.160 --> 17:01.680
That's why I don't think
it's about the end, exactly.

17:02.280 --> 17:06.760
It's more about
where people are before the end.

17:09.600 --> 17:12.800
-And where is that?
-The threshold.

17:15.120 --> 17:17.720
Or maybe the edge of a cliff.

17:20.400 --> 17:23.240
But it's so much scarier than that.

17:24.480 --> 17:25.440
What is?

17:26.760 --> 17:28.640
What's so much scarier than that?

17:30.120 --> 17:32.400
Staying in that place
for the rest of your life.

17:36.160 --> 17:38.040
I had a dream.

17:40.520 --> 17:43.520
Batwoman was showing me
the meaning of life.

17:43.600 --> 17:47.320
Okay. So what's the meaning
of life according to Batwoman?

17:48.800 --> 17:53.160
I have no idea. I don't know. I woke up

17:54.200 --> 17:55.440
and I forgot everything.

17:57.160 --> 18:02.600
The only thing I feel
is a tightness. You know? It's…

18:03.920 --> 18:05.080
It's shit!

18:07.160 --> 18:11.840
Here's what we'll do. You tell me
one secret, and I'll tell you another one.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.520
It might help you loosen up.

18:15.320 --> 18:19.000
Yes, don't worry! It's just one secret.
Okay? At the same time.

18:19.640 --> 18:24.120
-A secret?
-Yes. One, two, three.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.680
-I had a relationship with…
-I stole 20 euros from Dad.

18:39.680 --> 18:40.680
Yes?

18:49.800 --> 18:50.840
So…

18:51.880 --> 18:55.520
-In the last six months?
-Yes. How are we doing, Dário?

18:55.600 --> 18:58.400
According to what I have here,

18:59.440 --> 19:02.200
there was a 90% decrease.

19:02.280 --> 19:03.800
Ninety percent?

19:06.920 --> 19:09.600
I'm sorry, Dário. Do you mind?

19:12.560 --> 19:14.560
No, that's not quite right.

19:14.640 --> 19:17.240
In the first month, we had 33%.

19:17.920 --> 19:21.160
In the second month, we stayed at 48%.

19:22.400 --> 19:26.200
In the third month,
we stayed at around 76%.

19:28.280 --> 19:30.080
What does that mean?

19:30.160 --> 19:32.120
That we're on the verge of bankruptcy.

19:32.720 --> 19:35.720
That's impossible.
We've been working almost the entire time!

19:35.800 --> 19:38.760
Dário, how many weddings
have we had this month?

19:38.840 --> 19:40.280
-The whole month?
-Yes.

19:43.800 --> 19:45.800
-None.
-None?

19:46.800 --> 19:49.120
-But last week, they called here--
-No, Dad.

19:49.200 --> 19:52.680
There were none because you answered
the phone and insulted the bride's mother

19:52.760 --> 19:54.920
because she was calling
during office hours!

19:55.000 --> 19:55.840
Office hours?

19:55.920 --> 19:59.480
Yeah, Dad has a new job
and he takes pictures for real.

19:59.560 --> 20:00.520
Right, Dad?

20:01.240 --> 20:04.800
I'm sorry,
we haven't had a wedding in a month?

20:04.880 --> 20:08.760
Really, Mom? That's what I've been
trying to tell you, but no one listens!

20:08.840 --> 20:11.800
And the lawyer called to say
that if we don't catch up on our rent,

20:11.880 --> 20:12.840
we'll lose our farm!

20:12.920 --> 20:14.560
I'm sick of it! I'm sick!

20:16.920 --> 20:20.360
Can I go now? I have a wedding to go to.

20:35.200 --> 20:36.160
That's it?

20:37.320 --> 20:38.280
That's it.

20:41.440 --> 20:42.440
How about that?

20:50.880 --> 20:53.000
-Thank you.
-I really wanted to like it…

20:54.840 --> 20:56.960
but the truth is, I don't know how I feel.

21:00.400 --> 21:01.600
I know how you feel.

21:03.120 --> 21:04.040
Yeah?

21:04.680 --> 21:08.000
Just say it, my dear college classmate.
How do I feel?

21:13.640 --> 21:15.280
You feel guilty.

21:17.080 --> 21:19.000
That's an interesting point of view.

21:19.840 --> 21:22.320
Usually, it's the women
who throw that in my face.

21:23.360 --> 21:24.520
What about Vanessa?

21:26.640 --> 21:28.720
Did she throw that in your face too?

21:31.080 --> 21:33.440
Just tell me
what you think you know, Daniel.

21:35.640 --> 21:37.960
Tell me before this situation
becomes pathetic.

21:38.040 --> 21:42.960
We've been fighting for a woman
for how many years now? 25, 30 years?

21:44.280 --> 21:46.280
I don't know how old I am anymore.

21:47.920 --> 21:49.920
I deserve this exhibition.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.000
No one said otherwise.

22:01.480 --> 22:04.520
What I think is that
you don't like your life.

22:05.920 --> 22:08.800
It's written on your forehead.
It's in the way you move.

22:10.560 --> 22:14.560
It's in that fucking outfit.
Why do you dress like that?

22:17.320 --> 22:20.880
What happened to that guy who wanted
to conquer the world through his art?

22:20.960 --> 22:23.400
He's here, on the walls of your gallery.

22:25.040 --> 22:27.640
Okay. It's a start.

22:27.720 --> 22:30.120
No, it's an end.

22:32.640 --> 22:35.640
I know what's going on. I've always known.

22:36.240 --> 22:37.880
But it was Vanessa's choice.

22:37.960 --> 22:40.200
It was her decision. The consequences too.

22:40.280 --> 22:42.640
-I think you're a bit delirious.
-No.

22:43.320 --> 22:44.920
I've never been so lucid.

22:45.680 --> 22:47.200
Don't feel guilty.

22:49.240 --> 22:51.320
I trust Vanessa. I've always trusted her.

22:53.520 --> 22:54.800
Do you trust yourself?

22:56.040 --> 23:00.480
I deserve this exhibition,
be it here or in some other gallery.

23:10.560 --> 23:12.160
This one isn't as good.

24:22.920 --> 24:29.880
ROAD TRIP UNITED STATES

24:48.640 --> 24:54.320
DO YOU STILL HAVE YOUR TICKETS
TO THE STATES?

25:16.160 --> 25:23.080
HOW TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE

25:27.120 --> 25:32.320
I'M SCARED

25:32.400 --> 25:39.320
I WAS SCARED TOO
AND THEN I WENT TO INDIA

25:42.680 --> 25:43.600
What do you think?

25:46.120 --> 25:48.080
-Tastes like chicken.
-It is chicken.

25:48.160 --> 25:49.560
Yeah.

25:49.640 --> 25:52.960
It's just one of those meats
that you never quite know what it is.

25:53.880 --> 25:58.480
Look… People say it tastes like chicken,

25:58.560 --> 26:02.200
but it can be a mystery meat.
Koala, ostrich… I don't know.

26:04.520 --> 26:06.800
You were doing that
the first time I saw you.

26:07.440 --> 26:08.720
Sucking on a straw.

26:12.160 --> 26:13.760
So cute!

26:14.320 --> 26:15.320
Silly.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.520
But look, at least the drink
didn't taste like chewing gum.

26:21.320 --> 26:24.320
Do you know where you eat well? Istanbul.

26:24.920 --> 26:28.120
My son, Pedro, lives there.
I ate one of the best kebabs of my life.

26:28.200 --> 26:33.040
Absolutely extraordinary.
And the drinks weren't plastic.

26:34.360 --> 26:35.680
Was I too bold?

26:39.720 --> 26:41.040
To bring me…

26:43.040 --> 26:44.880
to eat fast food on the first date?

26:48.480 --> 26:50.000
It was some kind of hara-kiri.

26:51.120 --> 26:52.120
Russian roulette.

26:52.600 --> 26:54.040
Guillotine.

26:54.680 --> 26:56.080
-Gallows.
-Courage!

27:00.600 --> 27:02.720
You were brave. It takes courage.

27:04.760 --> 27:06.400
No one ever told me that.

27:07.800 --> 27:09.360
I thought it was more…

27:10.480 --> 27:13.240
-What?
-More imprudent.

27:13.960 --> 27:15.880
Yes, but do you know
where courage comes from?

27:16.520 --> 27:17.640
From imprudence.

27:18.280 --> 27:22.480
From a foolish, imprudent hope
that things can be much better

27:22.560 --> 27:24.880
than humanly possible. There you have it.

27:25.560 --> 27:27.320
Imprudent hope…

27:28.440 --> 27:29.520
I like that.

27:35.560 --> 27:36.840
What are you doing?

27:42.640 --> 27:45.440
I'm checking if you're finally separated.

27:51.080 --> 27:52.640
You did that for me. So sweet.

27:57.240 --> 28:00.760
-Are you enjoying it, your hamburger?
-It tastes like chicken!

28:18.200 --> 28:19.800
You're letting the fire die.

28:24.560 --> 28:28.160
It was here before I got here.
Someone left it like this.

28:35.640 --> 28:37.440
I heard you were looking for me.

28:40.200 --> 28:43.440
-So you met Batwoman?
-By chance.

28:43.520 --> 28:45.920
This week,
I hardly went into virtual reality.

28:46.640 --> 28:51.000
As a matter of fact,
I'm thinking about leaving it for good.

28:51.080 --> 28:53.640
Did you get tired of being an accountant?

28:54.280 --> 28:57.520
I got tired of being something I'm not.

29:06.200 --> 29:07.720
I had a dream.

29:10.200 --> 29:12.320
Actually, I'm not sure it was a dream.

29:13.840 --> 29:16.400
I saw the past and the future.

29:16.960 --> 29:20.800
And people were appearing and disappearing
like cosmic dust.

29:22.720 --> 29:26.800
-That's not really what cosmic dust is--
-Another lesson about the universe?

29:26.880 --> 29:27.880
Really?

29:35.800 --> 29:40.120
I just wanted to say
that we're not made of dust, but of stars.

29:41.080 --> 29:43.240
The stars die too, you know?

29:44.760 --> 29:47.040
The biggest of them all, the supernova…

29:48.200 --> 29:51.880
they shoot a lot of dust
and gas into space, it's true.

29:51.960 --> 29:54.440
That's what makes
those streaks we see in the sky.

29:55.600 --> 29:58.760
But the thing about the stars is,
even if they're dead,

29:59.400 --> 30:03.560
they continue to shine brightly
for a long time before they disappear.

30:07.560 --> 30:10.480
My sister is having an affair
with a married guy.

30:11.800 --> 30:14.840
My parents forgot
they have a business and bills to pay,

30:14.920 --> 30:20.000
and my mom hit her car against a tree.
No one can get it out of there.

30:22.600 --> 30:23.720
What about you?

30:26.240 --> 30:27.520
What's going on with you?

30:39.800 --> 30:41.240
I know you have no hard-on.

30:42.200 --> 30:45.160
You're the bear from planet Pashgyfder.

30:45.240 --> 30:48.240
Helpless, alone,
looking for meaning in life.

30:49.400 --> 30:50.680
But you're also Marco.

30:52.240 --> 30:53.520
And I like Marco.

30:55.760 --> 30:57.520
Marco shines brightly.

31:00.880 --> 31:03.360
Until he disappears for good,
like supernovas.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.120
That's for sure.

31:18.760 --> 31:20.640
What do we do in the meantime?

31:21.760 --> 31:22.920
We try.

31:23.560 --> 31:24.840
What else is there to do?

31:25.880 --> 31:27.400
Will you want sex?

31:28.360 --> 31:30.280
Yes, but I'll figure something out.

31:38.920 --> 31:41.800
-Planet Pashgfyder.
-Pashgeizter.

31:41.880 --> 31:43.000
Pashgeizter.

31:45.560 --> 31:48.840
<i>-I'm sorry, how old are you?</i>
<i>-I'm 25.</i>

31:49.920 --> 31:53.400
<i>You're not a girl anymore.</i>
<i>But you're not yet a woman.</i>

31:53.480 --> 31:55.520
Is that from a Beyoncé song?

31:56.560 --> 31:58.040
Britney Spears.

32:01.040 --> 32:02.520
You look beautiful on screen.

32:05.120 --> 32:06.360
What's that?

32:08.400 --> 32:09.600
I have no illusions.

32:10.920 --> 32:13.800
Unlike my poor mom,
who sees things that aren't there,

32:14.520 --> 32:16.840
I have both feet firmly on the ground.

32:23.720 --> 32:26.040
I can't understand you.

32:27.680 --> 32:29.160
It's pretty simple.

32:30.920 --> 32:32.800
We had the farm all to ourselves.

32:32.880 --> 32:35.200
I felt like it, you did too…

32:36.160 --> 32:38.520
We satisfied our hunger,
and now we're happy.

32:38.600 --> 32:41.640
Is that a tip for me to leave? That's it?

32:47.520 --> 32:48.920
I'm not a girl anymore.

32:50.320 --> 32:55.080
Of course not, you're a grown woman.
At what, 21 years?

32:55.160 --> 32:57.240
-Twenty-five.
-Twenty-five.

32:58.080 --> 33:03.120
And now you have to go back to your wife,
and I have to go back to my…

33:04.880 --> 33:05.840
to this.

33:09.360 --> 33:13.400
<i>She really deserves to be happy, Clarinha.</i>

33:17.920 --> 33:21.480
-Do you think if we had met--
-I think you deserve to be happy.

33:27.520 --> 33:28.600
You too.

33:39.760 --> 33:41.160
Is that clear, then?

33:42.760 --> 33:44.240
Clear as water.

33:44.840 --> 33:47.560
H2O, baby.

33:57.680 --> 34:00.840
That's two tickets
to the United States, first class.

34:02.400 --> 34:03.240
And…

34:04.960 --> 34:08.440
this is a virtual road trip,
planned by Siri.

34:09.600 --> 34:10.720
Isn't that brilliant?

34:13.040 --> 34:14.080
Let's go?

34:16.440 --> 34:17.640
Do you want to go with me?

34:22.680 --> 34:24.200
It's our chance, Vanessa.

34:27.160 --> 34:28.360
It's now or never.

34:36.520 --> 34:39.080
Sorry, give me a minute.

34:53.240 --> 34:54.760
You keep sabotaging me.

34:57.680 --> 35:01.880
Yeah? What have I done now
that bothers you so much?

35:01.960 --> 35:04.320
This guy doesn't want to go with you.

35:04.400 --> 35:09.520
This guy wants to experience what he never
had the chance to, act like he's still 20

35:09.600 --> 35:12.680
and his balls
aren't hanging down to his knees.

35:12.760 --> 35:14.120
Don't be vulgar.

35:15.200 --> 35:18.000
It has to be this way with you.
You're stubborn as hell.

35:18.560 --> 35:19.600
Hey!

35:19.680 --> 35:21.320
I'm you, remember?

35:22.400 --> 35:23.600
What do you want?

35:24.840 --> 35:28.160
What do you really want? Think hard.

35:31.280 --> 35:32.800
I want out of the cage.

35:34.800 --> 35:39.240
-I want to be free.
-The cage only exists in your mind.

35:39.320 --> 35:41.280
You're free to do whatever you want.

35:41.360 --> 35:43.480
You're free to tell both guys to fuck off,

35:43.560 --> 35:46.680
put a backpack on your back,
and go explore the world.

35:47.280 --> 35:48.480
With me, of course.

35:50.320 --> 35:52.040
So, alone.

35:53.120 --> 35:54.120
Are you afraid?

35:55.440 --> 35:56.320
I am.

35:57.160 --> 35:58.320
Afraid of what?

36:01.440 --> 36:04.840
-Of losing everything.
-Of losing everything?

36:04.920 --> 36:07.960
That's what is already happening.
Don't you get it?

36:08.040 --> 36:12.040
Losing everything… has already happened.

36:41.280 --> 36:43.200
-Hi.
-So?

36:47.280 --> 36:48.760
-Vanessa…
-Yes?

36:51.400 --> 36:53.000
I'm having a photo exhibition.

36:54.920 --> 36:56.040
At Vasco's gallery.

36:57.440 --> 37:00.080
And I'd like you to go.
If you have the time.

37:01.800 --> 37:02.840
Sure.

37:09.800 --> 37:12.520
I'm going to travel.

37:16.480 --> 37:18.080
I don't know when I'll be back.

37:30.480 --> 37:36.440
SO, SHALL WE TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE?

37:53.000 --> 37:54.800
The pigeon! Not me, idiot!

38:00.480 --> 38:01.560
Again.

38:13.880 --> 38:17.240
Who knew a sociologist could fire a gun?

38:26.640 --> 38:30.280
There's something deliciously primitive
about eating what you've hunted.

38:31.920 --> 38:32.920
It's very good.

38:39.120 --> 38:40.320
Aren't you going to eat?

38:42.160 --> 38:43.360
Of course I am.

38:43.440 --> 38:45.120
Rita, you're vegan.

38:45.200 --> 38:46.400
What's that?

38:47.240 --> 38:50.800
It's those greenish people
who only eat grass.

38:52.440 --> 38:53.880
Don't tell me you're one of those…

38:53.960 --> 38:58.480
I'm only vegan until I get ketchup.
With ketchup, I eat everything.

39:02.400 --> 39:05.320
Ketchup, Gertrudes. Quickly!

39:07.400 --> 39:11.880
So what brings
my dear grandchildren to our house?

39:12.680 --> 39:14.240
This is very unusual.

39:16.600 --> 39:17.800
-The farm--
-Mom and Dad.

39:19.400 --> 39:20.440
Which is it?

39:24.400 --> 39:25.600
So…

39:27.400 --> 39:28.880
your lawyer called us…

39:30.320 --> 39:33.320
Since we are a family,
he is our lawyer too.

39:34.520 --> 39:35.640
Because of the rent.

39:35.720 --> 39:40.560
Because of the lack of payment of rent.
That's what you mean to say, right, boy?

39:42.000 --> 39:43.320
It has been hard, Grandpa.

39:44.160 --> 39:48.480
I always said that Daniel
couldn't take care of the family farm.

39:50.320 --> 39:51.240
Maybe.

39:51.920 --> 39:54.840
-But we can.
-You?

39:55.960 --> 39:58.440
Yes. Rita and I.

40:00.360 --> 40:01.360
Thank you.

40:03.960 --> 40:06.440
-Explain yourselves.
-Eat.

40:07.280 --> 40:10.800
Well, Mom is going to travel,

40:11.880 --> 40:14.560
and Dad is obsessed with photography.

40:14.640 --> 40:16.600
Damn photography.

40:17.640 --> 40:20.000
Marco and I want the farm.

40:22.480 --> 40:26.040
We're adults.
We know the business from top to bottom.

40:27.800 --> 40:30.360
We do pretty much everything.

40:31.360 --> 40:32.920
We just need another month.

40:34.040 --> 40:36.080
-One month?
-Yes.

40:36.840 --> 40:39.440
A month without the lawyer after us,
and we'll pay the debt.

40:45.600 --> 40:47.360
Why don't you eat, Rita?

41:06.480 --> 41:08.840
-I haven't congratulated you yet.
-Why?

41:09.520 --> 41:12.280
You're the world's
first carnivorous vegan.

41:13.600 --> 41:15.680
-Do you want to see something?
-What?

41:24.440 --> 41:25.560
Suck it!

41:27.040 --> 41:29.600
While you were murdering pigeons,
I stole his lighter.

41:29.680 --> 41:32.440
The old man may be rich,
but he won't get away with the ghosts.

41:46.760 --> 41:47.600
Are you okay?

41:49.360 --> 41:50.600
As okay as I can be.

42:01.800 --> 42:03.600
Are you still sick of everything?

42:12.280 --> 42:13.760
So what about the exhibition?

42:14.720 --> 42:18.240
It opens Saturday. I'd like you to go.

42:19.280 --> 42:22.000
Of course, Dad. I really want to go.

42:30.760 --> 42:33.400
I want you to know that,
no matter what happens,

42:34.280 --> 42:35.480
we will be fine.

42:45.040 --> 42:46.040
Good night.

42:59.560 --> 43:01.000
-Lay it down.
-Check it out.

43:01.080 --> 43:03.240
-Lay it down.
-You have to help, Mom!

43:03.320 --> 43:05.600
-Come on!
-That's it!

43:05.680 --> 43:06.760
That's it!

43:07.640 --> 43:08.880
This isn't working.

43:08.960 --> 43:10.640
-It isn't?
-No, it has to be this way.

43:10.720 --> 43:12.040
-Then, let's go.
-Go.

43:12.760 --> 43:13.920
One, two, three!

43:14.000 --> 43:15.840
Get out of the way!

43:38.120 --> 43:39.560
You'll be okay, right?

43:39.640 --> 43:40.800
Okay, then.

43:43.480 --> 43:45.120
-I have to be.
-Okay.

43:45.200 --> 43:46.480
Then, we'll see.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.120
Wait!

44:02.200 --> 44:05.000
One, two, three!

44:24.280 --> 44:29.360
NEVER TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THE TIGER

44:42.560 --> 44:45.560
-Is that your…
-Yes. She's a friend.

44:48.560 --> 44:53.600
-Curious title for an exhibition.
-It's what I came up with.

44:57.760 --> 45:00.520
-I'm leaving.
-Yeah, I saw that.

45:02.520 --> 45:06.000
-As for the divorce papers…
-Don't worry. We'll take care of it later.

45:10.400 --> 45:13.320
-Are you going to India alone?
-Yes.

45:14.280 --> 45:18.040
-Completely alone.
-Where are you staying?

45:18.800 --> 45:20.040
I don't know.

45:20.120 --> 45:21.680
You didn't book a hotel?

45:23.720 --> 45:26.120
-No one's waiting for you at the airport?
-No.

45:27.200 --> 45:28.560
And you have no itinerary?

45:29.600 --> 45:30.680
-No.
-All right.

45:31.440 --> 45:32.800
That sounds perfect.

45:40.080 --> 45:41.600
I came to apologize.

45:43.160 --> 45:44.400
You were right.

45:45.240 --> 45:48.080
I never wanted to take any of this
away from you. I was selfish.

45:48.160 --> 45:51.480
-You don't need to apologize.
-I asked you for a second chance.

45:51.560 --> 45:56.080
And I couldn't say no to you.
I never knew how to say no to you.

45:57.200 --> 45:58.160
Say it now.

46:00.120 --> 46:01.200
No.

46:05.280 --> 46:07.040
We did what we could.

46:09.640 --> 46:12.320
If this is the best we could do,
I think it's very…

46:14.520 --> 46:16.440
We tried until the end.

46:16.520 --> 46:18.520
You can't ask for more than that.

46:20.400 --> 46:22.960
It's not supposed to be so hard, is it?

46:24.160 --> 46:27.640
We're not supposed
to have to push so hard.

46:30.040 --> 46:31.800
And you, what are you going to do?

46:32.960 --> 46:36.680
I'll stay here. Organizing my life.

46:38.480 --> 46:42.600
It's like someone told me the other day,
"imprudent hope."

46:42.680 --> 46:46.680
I have a foolish and imprudent hope
that things will get better.

46:54.120 --> 46:55.120
They already got better.

46:58.640 --> 46:59.720
What about our kids?

47:00.760 --> 47:01.720
Those two?

47:02.480 --> 47:03.800
They'll be just fine.

47:05.120 --> 47:07.480
-Do you have five minutes?
-I do.

47:56.320 --> 48:00.320
STOP! BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.
LOVE, THE BRIGAND, LIES IN WAIT.

49:58.360 --> 50:00.160
-She's coming.
-Yes, she is.

50:02.160 --> 50:03.480
Finally.

50:03.560 --> 50:05.520
-I have gum in my mouth.
-Gum?

50:05.600 --> 50:07.400
-Yep. Shit!
-Here she is.

50:16.240 --> 50:17.360
-Look.
-Here she comes.

50:19.680 --> 50:21.040
So cute!

50:21.120 --> 50:22.080
Thank you.

50:24.760 --> 50:26.880
-Hi!
-Hi!

50:26.960 --> 50:29.480
How are you? Nice meeting you! So cute!

50:29.560 --> 50:31.040
-Hi.
-Nice meeting you.

50:32.920 --> 50:35.880
-So cute! Let's go?
-Let's get going? This way.

50:35.960 --> 50:37.440
-Make yourself at home.
-Yes.

50:40.920 --> 50:45.200
The machine is also new.
We're starting from scratch.

50:45.280 --> 50:46.600
I'll tell you what,

50:46.680 --> 50:51.680
your episode
was the most watched of the entire season,

50:51.760 --> 50:54.360
in fact, of all the seasons
of <i>Love Your Neighbor.</i>

50:55.080 --> 50:58.200
We carried out a survey
and people were delighted with the farm.

50:58.280 --> 51:03.720
And this kind of rustic side, the charm.
And with Rita too.

51:04.680 --> 51:06.080
-With me?
-Yes.

51:06.160 --> 51:08.640
People were delighted with you.

51:08.720 --> 51:12.760
I have dozens of celebrity requests
to get married here.

51:13.360 --> 51:14.880
-Wow.
-Wow.

51:14.960 --> 51:16.760
"Wow" is the right word.

51:19.120 --> 51:21.560
So, let's talk about the future?

51:29.240 --> 51:30.240
Rita…

51:31.640 --> 51:32.600
Is everything okay?

51:35.040 --> 51:35.960
Yes.

51:37.040 --> 51:38.680
Let's talk about the future.

52:36.680 --> 52:41.560
