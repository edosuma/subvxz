00:23.815 --> 00:26.609
Okay. I got the almond milk
for Benecio.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.153
[object clattering]

00:30.405 --> 00:32.323
[thunderclap]

00:33.992 --> 00:34.951
Ah!

00:35.744 --> 00:37.620
[panting] Ah!

00:37.704 --> 00:39.998
Always with the dead ends.

00:40.707 --> 00:41.708
[gasps]

00:41.791 --> 00:43.418
Why are you still
chasing me?

00:43.501 --> 00:44.794
I'm a different person now.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.921
I haven't been
in a dark alley in forever.

00:47.005 --> 00:49.591
Come on,
I'm a stay-at-home dad.

00:49.674 --> 00:51.468
I mean, I'm not their "Dad."

00:51.551 --> 00:52.969
I'm not trying to replace him.

00:53.052 --> 00:54.888
Unless one day they asked me.
[chuckles nervously]

00:54.971 --> 00:57.724
I mean, that would mean
the world to me.

00:57.807 --> 00:59.142
[thunderclap]

00:59.225 --> 01:01.269
[gasps and grunts]

01:01.352 --> 01:03.772
You know, we missed you
at the school bake sale.

01:03.855 --> 01:05.648
All the parents took a vote.

01:05.732 --> 01:09.611
Your lemon squares sucked
and you're gonna die.

01:14.073 --> 01:16.159
[speaks in Spanish]
Que paso, corazon?

01:16.242 --> 01:18.077
Did you have another
Debbie nightmare?

01:18.161 --> 01:19.496
[groans] Yes.

01:19.579 --> 01:21.289
Aww... mi amor.

01:21.372 --> 01:23.124
Did you have
the chorizo dream?

01:23.208 --> 01:25.210
No, she didn't try
to cut off my penis,

01:25.293 --> 01:27.003
and serve it
at a book fair again.

01:27.086 --> 01:30.340
But I haven't had a decent
night's sleep in weeks.

01:30.423 --> 01:36.137

my most challenging enemy yet.

02:22.183 --> 02:23.560
Good morning, Janice.

02:23.643 --> 02:26.604
How is the most beautiful
school receptionist?

02:26.688 --> 02:28.398
-Oh, you!
-[laugh track plays]

02:28.481 --> 02:30.567
Oops! Let me turn this off.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.235
I was just sneaking my shows.
[chuckles]

02:32.318 --> 02:33.987
But who needs TV
when you've got

02:34.070 --> 02:36.364
Gotham City's most infamous
criminal mastermind

02:36.447 --> 02:38.616
turned sane bartender
turned back into unhinged

02:38.700 --> 02:40.785
but now equally
charming psychopath.

02:40.869 --> 02:43.246
[laughs] Janice, please.

02:43.329 --> 02:47.500
I'm just plain ol' Benecio
and Sophia's stepdad.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.752
Speaking of, do you have
the student list

02:49.836 --> 02:52.255
for the new Spanish
dual immersion program?

02:52.338 --> 02:55.967
It's so important to us
that our kids get
a bilingual education.

02:56.050 --> 03:01.097
Well, I'm not really
supposed to show
this list until next week.

03:01.180 --> 03:03.391
-I don't know...
-Mmm.

03:03.474 --> 03:06.185
Oh, you know,
I can't say no to you.

03:06.269 --> 03:07.186
Here it is.

03:08.104 --> 03:09.063
Ah...

03:09.147 --> 03:10.857
-Morning!
-[door bangs]

03:10.940 --> 03:12.233
[murmuring]

03:12.317 --> 03:14.444
The New Spanish
dual immersion student list.

03:14.527 --> 03:16.446
I think we're all very
excited to see that

03:16.529 --> 03:18.364
Madison and McKenna
got in, am I right?

03:18.448 --> 03:19.324
Am I right?

03:19.407 --> 03:20.950
Your kids got in?

03:21.034 --> 03:23.286
Now we're gonna know
if the maids are talking
about us

03:23.369 --> 03:25.079
when we're on vacation
in Cancun.

03:25.163 --> 03:27.790
[laughs] And I can't
help it if I have connections

03:27.874 --> 03:29.542
on the election board.

03:29.626 --> 03:30.960
Better luck next year,

03:31.044 --> 03:34.547
or as my maid says,
"escupo en tu comida."

03:37.383 --> 03:39.010
[Two-Face] You've got
to be kidding me.

03:39.093 --> 03:42.180
You wasted $400 million on ads!

03:42.263 --> 03:44.641
And another million
on custom Pez?

03:44.724 --> 03:47.352
-People love Pez.
-No one loves Pez.

03:47.435 --> 03:49.437
You don't need this
stuff to win.

03:49.520 --> 03:52.523
In the debates,
you can just tell
people directly

03:52.607 --> 03:55.735
your plans for Gotham
and what you stand for.

03:55.818 --> 03:56.986
Also, I've been
meaning to ask you.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.446
What do you stand for?

03:58.529 --> 04:00.239
Well, it's, um...

04:00.907 --> 04:03.618
I... [murmuring]

04:05.244 --> 04:07.205
Don't worry
your pretty little heart.

04:07.288 --> 04:10.375
I'll teach him
how to trail off like a pro.

04:11.376 --> 04:13.002
[laughs maniacally]

04:15.755 --> 04:17.340
-Ha!
-[Bethany groans]

04:17.423 --> 04:19.676
Are you still upset
about the dual
immersion program?

04:19.759 --> 04:21.511
Yes, it's so unfair!

04:21.594 --> 04:24.973
This program would
really help the kids
embrace their heritage.

04:25.056 --> 04:28.768
You know, one time,
I picked Benecio up
from soccer practice,

04:28.851 --> 04:31.813
-and I heard some other kids
mocking his name.
-[sighs]

04:31.896 --> 04:34.148
This program would
offer him something

04:34.232 --> 04:37.068
I can't give him.
More self-confidence.

04:37.151 --> 04:40.530
The opportunity to feel
a sense of pride in his name.

04:40.613 --> 04:42.991
A great boost
on his transcript

04:43.074 --> 04:46.077
for when he applies
to early admission at Oberlin.

04:46.160 --> 04:47.662
Always you with Oberlin.

04:47.745 --> 04:49.831
Dinnertime!

04:49.914 --> 04:51.708
[Gordon] Hey, mister,
that's strike two.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.376
You pop off like that again,
we're gonna cross swords.

04:53.459 --> 04:55.503
I'm all about changing Gotham
for the better.

04:55.586 --> 04:58.840
And if I'm lying,
may God strike you down.

04:58.923 --> 05:00.341
[gasps and groans]

05:00.425 --> 05:01.384
[grunts]

05:02.218 --> 05:03.511
You know the rules.

05:03.594 --> 05:05.221
There's no TV during dinner.

05:05.304 --> 05:07.265
I think we just saw
someone die.

05:07.348 --> 05:09.350
Sure did, buddy.

05:09.434 --> 05:12.562
So, say we couldn't get into
the dual immersion program.

05:12.645 --> 05:15.356
What's another thing
you guys are
interested in, huh?

05:16.357 --> 05:18.484
Uh, what about art or soccer?

05:18.568 --> 05:22.613
It's never too early to get
into kinesiology, Benecio.

05:22.697 --> 05:25.408
Uh, can I
just go by "Ben"?

05:25.491 --> 05:28.202
I don't want to stand out
in school.

05:28.286 --> 05:32.582
That's it! Debbie is gonna
get a tire iron straight
into the--

05:32.665 --> 05:34.834
Bethany, no, trust me.

05:34.917 --> 05:37.462
I know how to deal
with arch enemies.

05:37.545 --> 05:42.133
I'm cooking up something
extra special for Debbie.

05:42.216 --> 05:46.429
[laughing maniacally]

05:55.021 --> 05:57.315
[gasps]

06:03.696 --> 06:04.906
Hey, Debbie.

06:04.989 --> 06:06.199
Nice parking spot.

06:06.282 --> 06:08.618
So, you're a VIP, huh?

06:08.701 --> 06:10.203
Uh, yes, I am.

06:10.286 --> 06:12.789
Because I have
a very important job.

06:12.872 --> 06:15.166
And I need
a very important spot.

06:15.249 --> 06:16.918
-What do you want?
-Listen,

06:17.001 --> 06:18.211
I just wanted to show

06:18.294 --> 06:21.798
my appreciation for you,
and all you do.

06:21.881 --> 06:26.803
It's arroz con pollo
from mi casa to su casa.

06:26.886 --> 06:30.306
Mmm-hmm. And is that
an ethnic dish, or...

06:30.389 --> 06:32.975
It sure is "ethnic."

06:33.059 --> 06:34.769
Speaking of racist,

06:34.852 --> 06:36.145
I couldn't help but think

06:36.229 --> 06:38.272
about the dual
immersion program,

06:38.356 --> 06:41.317
and how amazing it would be
if you could pull some strings.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.527
Oh, I see.

06:42.610 --> 06:45.113
So you and your strong
smelling dish

06:45.196 --> 06:46.823
are trying to bribe me.
Is that it?

06:46.906 --> 06:48.366
Is that what you're
trying to do? Bribe me?

06:48.449 --> 06:50.660
Strong smelling? [sniffs]

06:50.743 --> 06:52.495
No. [chuckles softly]

06:52.578 --> 06:54.789
It's just that
there are only 24 spots

06:54.872 --> 06:57.834
in the program for all
of Gotham's school district,

06:57.917 --> 07:00.545
and I know you have
friends on the committee.

07:00.628 --> 07:02.171
Mmm. Oh, okay.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.464
So, you're
threatening me, then.

07:03.548 --> 07:05.091
Didn't you use to
blow things up?

07:05.174 --> 07:08.719
[laughs loudly] Oh, no...

07:08.803 --> 07:11.180
That was over a year ago?

07:11.264 --> 07:12.640
That's the old me.

07:12.723 --> 07:14.433
The only thing
I'm blowing up here

07:14.517 --> 07:17.603
is your waistline
with my yummy dish.

07:17.687 --> 07:19.313
Aw... I think it's so cute

07:19.397 --> 07:21.858
that you're out here trying
to do stuff for your kids.

07:21.941 --> 07:23.442
It's a adorable.

07:23.526 --> 07:26.404
I so wish I could help you,
but it's just out of my hands,

07:26.487 --> 07:28.197
and I guess it's out
of your hands, too.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.407
[chuckles nervously]

07:29.490 --> 07:32.285
Whose hands
would you say it's in?

07:32.368 --> 07:33.995
Well, the city sets the budget,

07:34.078 --> 07:36.414
so I'd take it up
with them or the mayor.

07:36.497 --> 07:39.917
Oh, but no, I guess
he just died.

07:40.001 --> 07:41.294
Oh, boo-hoo.

07:41.377 --> 07:42.962
Well, I guess you're just
gonna have to go down

07:43.045 --> 07:44.714
to City Hall
and file a complaint.

07:44.797 --> 07:46.507
-[engine revs]
-[tires squeal]

07:48.092 --> 07:51.137
Oh, I'll file
a fucking complaint.

07:52.346 --> 07:54.974
Oh, my God,
there were bones in this.

07:55.057 --> 07:56.601
[rock music playing]

07:58.352 --> 07:59.562
Whoo! We did it!

07:59.645 --> 08:02.273
Dad! Congrats on being
the only candidate

08:02.356 --> 08:03.774
to not die tonight.
But don't you think

08:03.858 --> 08:05.568
it's a little premature
to be celebrating?

08:05.651 --> 08:07.737
Barbara,
the opposition is dead.

08:07.820 --> 08:09.822
Winning by default
is a bigger victory

08:09.906 --> 08:11.199
than I could have
dreamed of.

08:12.909 --> 08:14.285
Boo!

08:14.368 --> 08:16.621
[sighs] Dad, you still
haven't even figured out

08:16.704 --> 08:17.914
your plan for Gotham.

08:17.997 --> 08:20.333
Gordy, remember
your trail off training?

08:20.416 --> 08:21.584
I'm glad you asked that.

08:21.667 --> 08:24.212
-I guess the...
-Dad.

08:24.295 --> 08:25.922
I know you love Gotham,

08:26.005 --> 08:27.965
and there are tons of things
that are important to you.

08:28.049 --> 08:30.801
So just make that the plan.

08:30.885 --> 08:32.511
What do you even
believe in, Dad?

08:32.595 --> 08:34.263
As Reagan once said,

08:34.347 --> 08:35.514
uh...

08:44.565 --> 08:45.483
The old Joker is back.

08:45.566 --> 08:46.525
Get two cameras on him.

08:46.609 --> 08:48.110
Where's the chopper cam?

08:48.194 --> 08:50.947
[Joker] Attention,
Gotham City.

08:51.030 --> 08:53.366
I've had it with your shit.

08:53.449 --> 08:56.452
I tried being a villain
that didn't work.

08:56.535 --> 08:58.913
I tried being a good stepdad.

08:58.996 --> 09:00.331
that didn't work.

09:00.414 --> 09:03.167
I tried meditation
and then-- Actually,

09:03.251 --> 09:04.460
that almost worked

09:04.543 --> 09:06.796
until the app I was using
started charging.

09:06.879 --> 09:10.800
Yet the city remains
a hateful asshole.

09:10.883 --> 09:14.053
That's why things are
going to change right now!

09:14.136 --> 09:16.722
[all screaming]

09:16.806 --> 09:17.765

09:31.279 --> 09:32.738
Less than 24 hours ago,

09:32.822 --> 09:35.074
Joker announced
he was running for mayor.

09:35.157 --> 09:36.993
Today, we are following Joker

09:37.076 --> 09:39.078
and his goons
to the Gotham Bank.

09:39.161 --> 09:41.038
For what? We're not sure.

09:41.122 --> 09:43.040
I'm Suave with Thrice TV.

09:43.124 --> 09:44.834
Can you tell us
what you're doing here today?

09:44.917 --> 09:48.587
Some mayoral candidates
take bribes from big money.

09:48.671 --> 09:52.174
I'm skipping the bribe part,
and just taking the money,

09:52.258 --> 09:54.593
and giving it back
to the citizens.

09:54.677 --> 09:56.429
Here's your money shot!

09:59.598 --> 10:01.350
Oh, wow. Ha!

10:01.434 --> 10:04.353
Hey, what do you hope
to accomplish as mayor
of Gotham?

10:04.437 --> 10:05.646
Well, to start,

10:05.730 --> 10:07.231
education reform.

10:07.315 --> 10:08.899
Every child should
have the choice

10:08.983 --> 10:12.403
to be in a dual immersion
class and be bilingual.

10:12.486 --> 10:14.613
I also want free
universal health care.

10:14.697 --> 10:17.366
Do you think Arkham would
have a three-year wait list

10:17.450 --> 10:21.037
if everyone had access
to free mental health services?

10:21.120 --> 10:25.333
And the rich one-percenters
are gonna pay for it all.

10:25.416 --> 10:28.753
Big changes are gonna happen.

10:28.836 --> 10:30.254
[laughing maniacally]

10:30.338 --> 10:31.422
-[gunshot]
-[screams]

10:31.505 --> 10:32.798
Damn it, Gary.

10:32.882 --> 10:34.675
I said we're not doing
the stupid

10:34.759 --> 10:36.427
Reservoir Dogs thing.

10:36.510 --> 10:38.262
You want the rich
to pay for all this?

10:38.346 --> 10:39.764
Are you like a socialist?

10:39.847 --> 10:42.391
I'm not like a socialist.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.685
I am a socialist.

10:44.769 --> 10:49.065
And together,
we're gonna fix this city.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.566
-[grunts]
-[gasps]

10:50.649 --> 10:53.361
I'm sorry. I thought
you were ready for that.

10:53.444 --> 10:54.570
We locked eyes,

10:54.653 --> 10:56.739
I-- You were looking
right here. Wh--

10:56.822 --> 11:00.076
This is our money!
Our Gotham.

11:00.159 --> 11:02.536
This, this has to be
some sort of trap.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.080
It's Joker, for crap's sake.

11:04.163 --> 11:07.208
He's Batman's arch-enemy,
and I'm Batman's best friend.

11:07.291 --> 11:08.376
Hmm.

11:08.459 --> 11:10.252
I just thought
it should be said.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.296
I just don't get it.
Why do people love him?

11:12.380 --> 11:14.090
Because he has good policies.

11:14.173 --> 11:17.009
Jesus, you need to start
wearing bangles or something

11:17.093 --> 11:18.677
'cause I never know
when you're in a room.

11:18.761 --> 11:19.970
Joker's preaching policies

11:20.054 --> 11:22.264
like free health care,
free tuition.

11:22.348 --> 11:24.767
Oh, God, is my own daughter
some kind of Jo-Bro?

11:24.850 --> 11:27.186
They prefer to be called
"Sane Clown Posse,"

11:27.269 --> 11:28.562
and I'm not a Jo-Bro.

11:28.646 --> 11:30.773
What we need to do
is fight dirtier than

11:30.856 --> 11:32.483
we've ever fought before.

11:32.566 --> 11:35.277
Do something truly diabolical.

11:35.361 --> 11:36.987
No, I'm drawing a line.

11:37.071 --> 11:39.198
Dad, I believe in you.

11:39.281 --> 11:40.699
A mayor needs policies

11:40.783 --> 11:42.159
and to be able
to make decisions.

11:42.243 --> 11:45.663
Well, I want you to make
a decision right now.

11:45.746 --> 11:48.165
Fire Two-Face
as your campaign manager.

11:48.249 --> 11:50.459
If you don't,
I can't support you.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.628
It's him or me.
You got to choose.

11:52.711 --> 11:54.296
Nepotism.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.465
Oh, man! What is it with women
in this family and ultimatums?

11:56.549 --> 11:58.050
Dad, choose!

11:58.134 --> 12:00.970
Babs, sweetie.
Things aren't
so black and white.

12:01.053 --> 12:02.930
There's shades of gray,
I don't have to choose

12:03.013 --> 12:05.599
Two-Face or you,
I can choose Two-Face,
then you.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.310
I'm so close to winning!

12:08.394 --> 12:09.812
I've never said that before.

12:09.895 --> 12:11.105
The ends will
justify the means,

12:11.188 --> 12:13.149
-I swear.
-It's crazy.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.943
She's so quiet,
you can't even hear her walk.

12:16.026 --> 12:18.279
Okay, when we talked
to Joker's hostages,

12:18.362 --> 12:20.197
-some of their comments were--
-Dad, can you--

12:20.281 --> 12:23.409
Kids stop, they're talking
about me again.

12:23.492 --> 12:24.785
I wasn't gonna vote before.

12:24.869 --> 12:26.454
But after hearing
about his plans

12:26.537 --> 12:29.540
for universal health care,
I will now.

12:29.623 --> 12:30.666
Also, he's kind of hot.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.042
-[excited chatter]
-Oh, moi?

12:32.126 --> 12:33.669
Did you hear that, honey?

12:33.752 --> 12:35.087
People think I'm hot.

12:35.171 --> 12:37.840
Yeah, he's kind of hot
in like a David--

12:37.923 --> 12:43.012
Augh! But... David who?
Spade? Tennant?

12:43.095 --> 12:45.055
Cono. No TV
at the dinner table.

12:45.139 --> 12:46.515
This was your rule, remember?

12:46.599 --> 12:48.851
You wanted us to talk
like a family, remember?

12:48.934 --> 12:50.811
Yes, yes, yeah.

12:50.895 --> 12:52.271
Yes, yes.

12:52.354 --> 12:55.524
So, does anyone else
want to talk about their day?

12:55.608 --> 12:58.235
Today, the teacher said
that dinosaurs died out

12:58.319 --> 12:59.695
because they didn't
have religion.

12:59.778 --> 13:01.238
That's exciting.

13:01.322 --> 13:03.157
You want to know
something else exciting.

13:03.240 --> 13:06.869
My favorite toilet read,
Vanity Fair called!

13:06.952 --> 13:09.580
Radhika, the editor
wants to feature me

13:09.663 --> 13:12.625
in her series about
political game-changers.

13:12.708 --> 13:15.836
Me, a political game-changer.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.881
Dad, you're still coming
to my soccer game
tomorrow, right?

13:18.964 --> 13:22.051
What?
Oh, the game! Oh!

13:22.134 --> 13:24.678
I'm sorry, buddy.
I can't.

13:24.762 --> 13:27.348
I have the big campaign
parade tomorrow.

13:27.431 --> 13:31.143
I have to put my focus
on the important stuff first,

13:31.227 --> 13:32.603
then you guys.

13:34.522 --> 13:37.733
Whoops, I mean,
you guys are first,

13:37.816 --> 13:40.236
always first.
I'm doing all this

13:40.319 --> 13:44.406
for you and the kids
because you always come first.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.325
Well, I'm done eating.
Gotta go.

13:48.327 --> 13:52.122
[people chanting]
Joker! Joker!

13:55.084 --> 13:57.086
Okay, boys.

13:57.169 --> 13:58.379
-[gasps]
-Let them have it.

13:59.588 --> 14:02.591
[all cheering]

14:02.675 --> 14:05.344
Change is happening!

14:05.427 --> 14:06.595
-[laughing maniacally]
-[Gunshot]

14:06.679 --> 14:08.389
Damn it, Gary.

14:08.472 --> 14:11.308
[all cheering]

14:11.392 --> 14:13.352
-[phone vibrating]
-[woman] I love you!

14:15.646 --> 14:17.815
Two-Face, perfect timing.

14:17.898 --> 14:19.400
You calling to concede?

14:19.483 --> 14:21.068
[Two-Face] What?
How'd you know it was me?

14:21.151 --> 14:24.613
Um, we used to work
together, like a lot.

14:24.697 --> 14:27.449
[Two-Face] Oh, well, yeah,
I'm just surprised
you kept my number

14:27.533 --> 14:29.493
after all we've been
through, you know?

14:29.577 --> 14:31.078
Did you, like, want something?

14:31.161 --> 14:33.038
I'm about to give my speech.

14:33.122 --> 14:35.624
[Two-Face] Oh, yeah.
No, I just thought that
you should know.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.126
-I have your son.
-What?

14:37.209 --> 14:38.836
[Benecio] Dad,
please come get me.

14:38.919 --> 14:40.629
[Two-Face] If you ever want
to see him alive again,

14:40.713 --> 14:43.632
come to the abandoned
amusement park alone.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.135
And in case,
I'm not being clear here,

14:46.218 --> 14:50.014
I have kidnapped your son
and I'm holding him hostage.

14:50.097 --> 14:51.682
Yeah, I got that.

14:51.765 --> 14:54.310
Sorry. I'm... I'm used to
spelling things out for Gordo.

14:54.393 --> 14:55.936
You probably don't need...
anyways.

14:56.020 --> 14:57.521
Uh, okay, bye.

14:58.439 --> 15:01.025
[chanting] Joker! Joker!

15:03.569 --> 15:05.821
[chanting] Joker! Joker!

15:10.701 --> 15:12.661
[chanting stops]

15:12.745 --> 15:15.331
I'm coming, Benecio!

15:16.040 --> 15:17.625
[thunderclap]

15:18.792 --> 15:20.461
[eerie music playing]

15:22.254 --> 15:23.422
Okay, I'm here.

15:23.505 --> 15:25.049
-Where's the bomb threat?
-Bomb threat?

15:25.132 --> 15:27.343
I never said anything
on the phone about a bomb--

15:27.426 --> 15:28.719
Whatever. You're here.

15:28.802 --> 15:31.680
Yes, I am. Whoa!
Hey, Two-Face, what is this?

15:31.764 --> 15:33.515
It's Joker's step-son.

15:33.599 --> 15:35.476
Once Joker sees
we have his kid,

15:35.559 --> 15:37.478
we can make him
drop out of the race.

15:37.561 --> 15:41.357
If he refuses,
I press the start
button on the coaster,

15:41.440 --> 15:43.317
and Benny here
is gonna find out

15:43.400 --> 15:45.194
why this place shut down.

15:45.277 --> 15:46.862
-[laughs]
-What?

15:46.945 --> 15:50.324
You kidnapped an innocent kid
and are threatening murder?

15:50.407 --> 15:51.575
Two-Face, crimes like these

15:51.659 --> 15:52.868
are considered
especially heinous.

15:52.951 --> 15:55.329
-You have to let him go.
-No fucking way.

15:55.412 --> 15:58.040
We can't go back now
because we're in too deep,

15:58.123 --> 16:00.668
and I'm trying to keep up
above in my head

16:00.751 --> 16:02.086
instead of going under!

16:02.169 --> 16:04.296
Instead of going under!

16:04.380 --> 16:08.050
I'm sorry. Sum 41 was playing
in the car on the way here.

16:08.133 --> 16:09.677
[chuckles] I love that band.

16:09.760 --> 16:10.928
But we're still doing this.

16:11.011 --> 16:13.222
-I trusted you.
-Why?

16:13.305 --> 16:15.140
Why do you keep trusting me?

16:15.224 --> 16:17.851
My name is Two-face.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.895
I almost feel like
you're trolling me.

16:19.978 --> 16:22.231
Being Two-Faced is what I do.

16:22.314 --> 16:23.899
It's pretty straightforward.

16:23.982 --> 16:26.568
I kidnap kids.
I poison mayors.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.654
Poison... poison mayors?

16:30.239 --> 16:31.990
Did you kill the mayor?

16:32.074 --> 16:34.451
I had to take action
because I'm trying
to win you this race.

16:34.535 --> 16:37.579
Do you think he died
just because he was
impaled by a pole?

16:37.663 --> 16:39.456
He was taut for 62.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.750
That guy had cum gutters.

16:43.711 --> 16:46.922
I'm here. No, Beth, I'm sorry,
but you can't come.

16:47.005 --> 16:48.549
I promise
I'll get Benny back safe.

16:48.632 --> 16:51.760
Just get Sophia
to your sister's house.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.263
No, no, not your
brother's place.

16:54.346 --> 16:57.391
Because he smokes
and Sophia has asthma.

16:57.474 --> 17:00.436
That's why.
Well, someone there smokes.

17:00.519 --> 17:02.062
I know I smelled something.

17:02.146 --> 17:04.106
Look, I got to go.

17:04.189 --> 17:06.191
I love you. Bye.

17:06.275 --> 17:08.360
Where the hell is Benecio?

17:08.444 --> 17:11.196
Oh, hi. Yeah, I'm doing fine.
Thank you for asking.

17:11.280 --> 17:14.283
We can chitchat
when you give me back
my step-son.

17:14.366 --> 17:16.910
Drop out of the race.
and I'll let your kid go free.

17:16.994 --> 17:19.121
If you refuse,
I'll press this button,

17:19.204 --> 17:21.582
-and Benecio
is gonna take off...
-[Benecio whimpering]

17:21.665 --> 17:24.126
...on these broken tracks.
[laughs wickedly]

17:24.209 --> 17:27.880
Wow, Gordon, I didn't take you
for a child murderer.

17:27.963 --> 17:29.381
No shit.

17:29.465 --> 17:32.801
I am Jim Gordon,
and I do not approve
this message.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.763
You four-faced son of a bitch.

17:39.558 --> 17:41.518
Okay, I'll drop out.

17:45.063 --> 17:47.399
-You think I made
a hard choice?
-Dad!

17:47.483 --> 17:48.650
Wrong.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.402
I'm only running for
mayor for my family,

17:50.486 --> 17:53.447
and I'll quit for my family
just as easily.

17:53.530 --> 17:55.699
Wow, I didn't even stop
drinking from my family.

17:55.783 --> 17:57.743
Well, I did. But then
I started drinking again,

17:57.826 --> 17:59.578
but it wasn't as much.

17:59.661 --> 18:03.373
I'm sorry. I've been a bit
of a... well, of a douche.

18:05.042 --> 18:06.502
-I love you.
-Uh-huh.

18:06.585 --> 18:08.128
-Let's go home.
-I don't think so.

18:08.212 --> 18:09.880
[lock clicks]

18:09.963 --> 18:11.340
What do you think
you're doing? You said
you would let him go.

18:11.423 --> 18:12.716
-Why would you lie?
-Seriously?

18:12.800 --> 18:14.885
You're making this
really not fun for me.

18:14.968 --> 18:17.137
"Two-Face" is my name.

18:17.221 --> 18:20.808
And if Joker is still alive,
he will always be a threat.

18:20.891 --> 18:24.186
You will be mayor
and I will be DA again.

18:24.269 --> 18:26.021
So that's what
this is all about.

18:26.105 --> 18:29.983
You act like you care,
but deep down,
you're as dark as me.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.693
I mean, look where we are.

18:31.777 --> 18:34.988
Now, step back
and let me take care of this.

18:35.072 --> 18:37.032
-No!
-[both screaming]

18:38.283 --> 18:40.452
-[grunts]
-[both screaming]

18:40.536 --> 18:42.913
Shit! Shit!
Gordon, do something!

18:56.426 --> 18:58.762
Superman! Dad, we're saved!

18:58.846 --> 19:02.015
Oh, no. It's just Gordon,
keep screaming, son.

19:02.099 --> 19:04.643
[screaming]

19:07.771 --> 19:10.524
-Joker, grab my hand!
-Yes.

19:10.607 --> 19:12.776
[both grunting]

19:14.153 --> 19:15.863
[screaming]

19:24.788 --> 19:27.207
[chuckles nervously]
Gordon!

19:28.041 --> 19:29.877
Shit! Hold on!

19:29.960 --> 19:31.920
[all screaming]

19:32.838 --> 19:34.381
[both grunting]

19:34.464 --> 19:37.301
-Benny. Benny! Oh!
-[groans softly]

19:37.384 --> 19:38.886
Thank God!

19:40.512 --> 19:42.973
You're okay. Physically.

19:43.056 --> 19:45.309
Mentally, this is messed up.

19:47.769 --> 19:50.439
Gordon, no! Don't kill him.

19:50.522 --> 19:52.441
I have to.
He's done too much.

19:52.524 --> 19:55.819
Look, no one wants to kill
Two-Face more than me,

19:55.903 --> 19:58.655
[chuckles] But killing him
won't solve the problem.

19:58.739 --> 20:02.034
It'll just make things worse.
That's not what you do.

20:02.117 --> 20:05.203
You're Commissioner Gordon,
remember?

20:05.287 --> 20:07.080
You make things better.

20:07.164 --> 20:09.291
My God, you're right. Whoa!
You really have changed.

20:09.374 --> 20:13.462
You're the kind of step-dad
I wish I could be for my own
biological daughter.

20:13.545 --> 20:16.757
I just want to be someone
my family can be proud of.

20:16.840 --> 20:19.134
I already am proud of you, Dad.

20:19.217 --> 20:21.470
You called me "Dad"?

20:21.553 --> 20:23.221
I've been calling you "Dad."

20:23.305 --> 20:26.767
I called you "Dad"
like, three times
on the roller coaster.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.937
Not that it'll make much
of a difference for you,

20:30.020 --> 20:31.521
but I'm gonna drop out
of the race.

20:31.605 --> 20:32.648
You should be mayor.

20:32.731 --> 20:34.900
Really?
You mean it?

20:34.983 --> 20:35.984
Yes.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.486
Congratulations, Mr. Mayor.

20:37.569 --> 20:40.322
Gordon, I don't know
what to say.

20:40.405 --> 20:41.865
Thank you.

20:41.949 --> 20:44.326
Yeah, it's pretty wild,
but it's for a brighter future.

20:44.409 --> 20:45.911
Being Commissioner
ain't so bad.

20:45.994 --> 20:47.496
I look forward to
working for you.

20:47.579 --> 20:49.289
No, no, no, no, no.

20:49.373 --> 20:52.834
My first act as mayor
is dismantling
the police department.

20:52.918 --> 20:54.753
You're out of a job.
[chuckles]

20:54.836 --> 20:57.297
Sorry. Let's go, Benecio.

20:57.381 --> 21:00.008
Should've killed me
when you had the chance.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.593
[vehicle approaching]

21:01.677 --> 21:03.553
Ahh! Watch the faces.

21:03.637 --> 21:05.514
All right,
I dropped Sophia off.

21:05.597 --> 21:08.225
Now let me at him.
He's gonna be a "No-Face"
when I'm done with him.

21:08.308 --> 21:10.310
Oh, good. Your mother found us.

21:10.394 --> 21:14.606
Ooh! And it's Tuesday.
Let's get tacos!

21:14.690 --> 21:16.441
David Boreanaz!

21:16.525 --> 21:20.487
I bet that's the David
that she said I look like.

21:23.824 --> 21:26.952
Barbara, I'm sorry.
I choose you.

21:27.035 --> 21:29.705
From now on, it's always you.

21:29.788 --> 21:32.457
[voice-over]
There's a new dawn
on Gotham City.

21:33.458 --> 21:36.378
There's no limit to what we do.

21:36.461 --> 21:37.796
Like Miss Walter do.

21:37.879 --> 21:39.715
-Like I do.
-Like I do.

21:39.798 --> 21:41.383
Like we do!

21:41.466 --> 21:42.718
[speaking Spanish]
Como yo lo hago.

21:42.801 --> 21:45.387
Like we all do!

21:45.470 --> 21:46.722
[people cheering]

21:46.805 --> 21:49.558
I am your mayor,
and I approved this message.

21:49.641 --> 21:54.229
[chanting] Joker! Joker!

21:54.312 --> 21:59.443
-[chanting] Joker! Joker!
-[all cheering]

22:00.652 --> 22:03.196
Ah, I'm so glad
we're home. [sighs]

22:03.280 --> 22:05.240
Wait. What the... [gasps]

22:05.323 --> 22:07.367
We were gone for four days.

22:09.828 --> 22:10.996
[groans]

22:11.079 --> 22:11.955
Morning!

22:12.039 --> 22:13.498
You're in my spot.

22:13.582 --> 22:14.750
Correction.

22:17.002 --> 22:19.212
I'm your nightmare now, bitch.

22:19.296 --> 22:22.591
[laughing maniacally]

22:26.136 --> 22:28.221
