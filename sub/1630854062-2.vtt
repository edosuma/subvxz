00:06.131 --> 00:08.466
THIS SERIES IS INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY

00:08.550 --> 00:11.886
BUT CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
HAVE BEEN REIMAGINED FOR DRAMATIC PURPOSES

00:39.205 --> 00:42.417
The drugs aren't mine. You know.

00:43.460 --> 00:44.919
I'm a businessman.

00:46.087 --> 00:47.672
I'm not guilty.

00:47.756 --> 00:51.718
You will be transferred
to Sint Maarten and put on trial.

00:52.260 --> 00:53.386
Drag him out.

01:11.154 --> 01:13.865
PRISON, SINT MAARTEN

01:22.665 --> 01:24.459
Sir, may I have access to a phone?

01:25.585 --> 01:27.462
You've been arrested for drug smuggling.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.506
No phone, ever.

01:49.651 --> 01:53.113
Please check my wallet.
I have 200 dollars. You take it.

01:53.196 --> 01:56.157
You'll get more after my phone call.

02:02.205 --> 02:04.833
How many times
do I have to repeat myself to you?

02:04.916 --> 02:06.960
I promise I didn't smuggle drugs.

02:07.544 --> 02:09.838
How am I supposed to know
how they got there?

02:11.506 --> 02:13.550
Listen. You're the Korean embassy.

02:13.633 --> 02:15.885
Isn't it your job
to figure out what happened here

02:15.969 --> 02:18.471
and assign me a lawyer or something?

02:18.555 --> 02:20.849
Wait a sec.
What the hell do you mean "paperwork"?

02:20.932 --> 02:22.976
I'm stuck in prison right now!

02:25.645 --> 02:27.981
<i> Is this the reason</i>
<i>why you went to Suriname?</i>

02:28.064 --> 02:30.191
<i>Trying to smuggle drugs?</i>
<i>What were you thinking?</i>

02:30.275 --> 02:32.110
I didn't do it, okay?

02:34.362 --> 02:36.197
Darling, please believe me.

02:38.825 --> 02:41.161
Has anyone from Suriname
tried to call you?

02:41.244 --> 02:42.912
Have you heard at all from Eungsoo?

02:42.996 --> 02:45.165
<i>No. No one's called me.</i>

02:45.248 --> 02:46.583
Sweetheart,

02:47.208 --> 02:49.169
I'm gonna look for a lawyer.

02:49.252 --> 02:51.212
Get working on your appeal, okay?

02:51.713 --> 02:52.630
Ah.

02:52.714 --> 02:55.175
A lawyer would cost tens
of millions of won.

02:55.258 --> 02:56.551
We can't.

02:56.634 --> 02:59.762
We'll have to come up with it.

02:59.846 --> 03:01.556
I'll break the apartment lease.

03:01.639 --> 03:03.224
No, you can't do that.

03:04.225 --> 03:05.768
Don't break the lease, please.

03:05.852 --> 03:08.521
I don't want the kids
to lose the apartment.

03:09.397 --> 03:12.984
Anyway, it won't be easy to overturn
the charges from what I've seen here.

03:13.067 --> 03:15.570
Don't waste any money.

03:15.653 --> 03:16.863
But, honey…

03:18.573 --> 03:20.658
What do I do? I'm so scared.

03:21.492 --> 03:25.038
<i>Hey,</i>
<i>it's going to be okay. I promise.</i>

03:25.622 --> 03:26.789
You know me, honey. Come on.

03:26.873 --> 03:29.334
I'll figure something out. I always do.

03:29.417 --> 03:31.252
All right?

03:31.336 --> 03:32.754
Let me talk to the kids.

03:33.755 --> 03:34.839
Hey.

03:34.923 --> 03:37.133
Hang up now. The warden is coming.

03:38.092 --> 03:39.260
Okay. One minute, one minute.

03:39.844 --> 03:41.846
No! Hurry up!

03:41.930 --> 03:43.640
-Okay.
-<i>Dad!</i>

03:44.140 --> 03:45.266
Hey, Hyungju.

03:45.350 --> 03:46.851
Listen, son. I'm on a business trip,

03:46.935 --> 03:48.978
and I won't be able to call
for a little while.

03:49.062 --> 03:52.148
So please, look after your mom and sister.
One more thing--

03:54.275 --> 03:55.944
Get my money.

04:03.618 --> 04:06.037
Aw. Papa hung up.

04:15.463 --> 04:18.716
Minseo, Daddy's busy right now.

04:19.384 --> 04:21.261
He'll call back when he can.

04:21.344 --> 04:23.930
But until then,
let's pray for him while we wait.

04:24.013 --> 04:26.140
-All right?
-Okay.

04:49.831 --> 04:51.457
You have to pay me today.

04:51.541 --> 04:53.001
Borrow from your friend.

04:53.084 --> 04:54.210
Friend?

04:54.294 --> 04:56.462
You have a visitor. Come out.

05:12.687 --> 05:14.105
Yes, I understand.

05:14.605 --> 05:16.482
I just need a little more time.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.696
I'll… I'll call you back soon.

05:24.949 --> 05:25.867
Uh, hello.

05:25.950 --> 05:27.910
Ingu.

05:27.994 --> 05:30.204
Hi. What happened to you, my man?

05:30.288 --> 05:32.123
-Ah! You look horrible!
-What's going on?

05:32.206 --> 05:36.336
I can't believe you, bud.
What have you gotten yourself into?

05:36.836 --> 05:38.671
I'm from
the National Intelligence Service.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.131
Act like we're friends.

05:45.261 --> 05:46.804
Here… here we go, sir.

05:48.264 --> 05:49.098
For you.

05:52.769 --> 05:53.978
Give me one more.

06:12.872 --> 06:15.375
Like I said, I'm NIS.
My name is Choi Changho.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.502
Is this about the cocaine?

06:17.585 --> 06:20.421
I didn't do it.
I really don't know anything.

06:20.505 --> 06:22.256
And I called the Korean embassy, but I--

06:22.340 --> 06:24.675
Yes. I'm well aware.

06:25.259 --> 06:28.096
I'm here to help you, Mr. Kang.
So please, don't worry.

06:53.579 --> 06:55.665
What makes you so sure I'm not guilty?

06:55.748 --> 06:58.584
Because I know
who's smuggling drugs in Suriname.

07:00.336 --> 07:01.796
You're familiar with Pastor Jeon.

07:02.380 --> 07:04.799
Yeah. So what about him?

07:04.882 --> 07:08.719
Jeon Yohan is a smuggler.
He's why you're in jail.

07:16.144 --> 07:17.728
Look familiar?

07:17.812 --> 07:20.815
He's a pastor
at a Korean church in Paramaribo.

07:20.898 --> 07:22.859
But he's really a drug trafficker.

07:22.942 --> 07:26.654
He controls 60% of all of Europe's
narcotics distribution and trade.

07:26.737 --> 07:27.697
In Suriname,

07:27.780 --> 07:29.991
they call him the cocaine godfather.

07:47.425 --> 07:49.469
What the hell are you talking about?

08:53.533 --> 08:54.700
1990, INCHEON

08:54.784 --> 08:56.244
<i>Eighteen years ago,</i>

08:56.327 --> 09:00.122
<i>there was a massive operation to arrest</i>
<i>a meth-smuggling gang in Incheon.</i>

09:01.624 --> 09:04.919
<i>The operation was successful,</i>
<i>and the network was shut down.</i>

09:08.464 --> 09:11.759
<i>But the man in charge of distribution</i>
<i>managed to evade us.</i>

09:11.842 --> 09:14.595
<i>Taking with him ten kilograms of meth.</i>

09:14.679 --> 09:16.514
<i>That man was Jeon Yohan.</i>

09:17.306 --> 09:20.059
<i>Much later,</i>
<i>the police discovered his escape route.</i>

09:20.142 --> 09:23.104
<i>He had crawled more than 14 kilometers</i>
<i>through the sewers.</i>

09:23.688 --> 09:27.984
<i>It would appear as though he's continued</i>
<i>his meth-dealing operations.</i>

09:28.818 --> 09:32.530
But that wasn't the reason
he showed up on our radar again

09:32.613 --> 09:33.906
three years later.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.659
GEOJE CONSTRUCTION
INVESTMENT CONTRACT

09:37.326 --> 09:41.080
Geoje Construction
is embarking on an exciting new journey.

09:41.163 --> 09:43.040
We're investing in foreign earners.

09:43.124 --> 09:46.210
Or really, the top five percent in Asia,
to be exact.

09:46.711 --> 09:49.964
We've been working behind-the-scenes
with the government for some time now.

09:50.047 --> 09:52.967
So, it gives me great pleasure
to introduce…

09:54.260 --> 09:57.680
UNESCO World Heritage Site
Geoje Mongdol Beach.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.480
Tell me.

10:07.148 --> 10:09.859
How on earth
did he pull something like this off?

10:11.819 --> 10:14.947
He certainly has many friends,
if that's what you're asking me.

10:16.907 --> 10:19.535
Did you know the president
was born in Geoje?

10:20.911 --> 10:22.288
I'll put it like this.

10:23.581 --> 10:25.916
Who else grew up right here
with our president?

10:26.000 --> 10:29.295
I don't need to tell you…

10:44.435 --> 10:46.812
GEOJE CONSTRUCTION
INVESTMENT CONTRACT

10:57.615 --> 11:00.409
<i>Yohan never planned</i>
<i>for the deal to go through.</i>

11:00.493 --> 11:04.038
<i>In fact, the investor's money</i>
<i>never even made it past his bank account.</i>

11:04.538 --> 11:07.500
<i>But his victims</i>
<i>couldn't report him to the police.</i>

11:08.000 --> 11:09.960
<i>Because before they knew</i>
<i>what was happening,</i>

11:10.044 --> 11:11.837
<i>he had them hooked on meth.</i>

11:21.097 --> 11:26.143
<i>Eventually, despite the fraud,</i>
<i>they all came crawling back for more meth.</i>

11:26.227 --> 11:27.687
-Mr. Jeon.
-Hmm?

11:28.479 --> 11:32.191
These fine gentleman
don't even plan to press charges.

11:32.274 --> 11:34.402
Perhaps they'd be interested
in further opportunities.

11:34.485 --> 11:36.862
Yeah.
A Cambodian used-car business, right?

11:36.946 --> 11:38.698
We can invest.

11:39.865 --> 11:42.034
Just give us more champagne, please.

11:42.576 --> 11:44.328
My family's rich. No problem.

11:44.412 --> 11:45.830
They can afford it.

11:45.913 --> 11:47.248
Hand it over.

11:50.042 --> 11:52.837
Here. Take it. An initial investment.

<i>He let his guard down.</i>

12:18.279 --> 12:19.196
Here.

12:20.364 --> 12:21.282
For you.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.287
What? This is all of it?

12:26.370 --> 12:27.288
Hey.

12:27.371 --> 12:30.708
You expected more
for just having to say a few lines?

12:32.293 --> 12:34.670
It's that plus your bonus. Hmm?

12:41.135 --> 12:43.721
I'm exhausted.

12:50.352 --> 12:52.271
-Come here!
-Hey!

12:58.694 --> 13:00.905

It sure takes a lot of nerve.

13:26.263 --> 13:28.474
You go and pretend
you know the president too?

13:28.557 --> 13:29.892
Don't kill me!

13:29.975 --> 13:31.227
Please!

13:31.310 --> 13:33.395
No, no, no! I'm sorry!

13:33.479 --> 13:36.023
I'm… I shouldn't have done that, but…

13:36.106 --> 13:37.942
Don't kill me! I'm begging you!

13:38.025 --> 13:40.736
I'll tell you. I'll tell you everything.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.696
Please don't kill me. I'm sorry.

13:42.780 --> 13:45.658
I'm so, so, so sorry, sir!

13:52.122 --> 13:53.499
You know about us.

13:55.042 --> 13:56.585
You know about this place, right?

14:00.506 --> 14:02.800
And you've heard about
how creative we can be.

14:04.593 --> 14:06.637
Pretty much nothing is off the table.

14:07.388 --> 14:08.222
Yes.

14:11.308 --> 14:13.269
How much cash was it?

14:23.904 --> 14:24.989
Shit.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.242
Ah!

14:28.325 --> 14:30.828
The air is so fresh out here.

14:33.914 --> 14:34.790
After that,

14:34.874 --> 14:37.877
Jeon realized he wouldn't be able
to pull off his old tricks,

14:37.960 --> 14:39.962
so he moved on to different methods.

14:40.045 --> 14:41.463
Hallelujah!

14:41.547 --> 14:42.923
Hallelujah!

14:43.007 --> 14:44.633
Hallelujah!

14:50.347 --> 14:53.475
"You are my little sheep."
That's what God said.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.311
Come forth and be cleansed by Him.

14:55.394 --> 14:57.605
Please come forward, one by one.

14:57.688 --> 14:58.939
Amen.

14:59.565 --> 15:03.527
<i>With a congregation of 12,000,</i>

15:03.611 --> 15:05.070
<i>And behind all that success</i>

15:05.154 --> 15:09.408
was Jeon's winning smile, sharp tongue,
and, of course, his meth.

15:09.491 --> 15:12.161
-Do you love your God?
-Amen!

15:12.244 --> 15:14.997
-Do you love your God?
-Amen!

15:16.624 --> 15:18.542
God loves you too!

Amen.

15:20.294 --> 15:22.463
Let us praise him. Hallelujah!

15:22.546 --> 15:24.340
Hallelujah!

15:28.719 --> 15:32.222
Ten million, 20, make that 30.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.352
Ooh!

15:39.271 --> 15:40.773
Wow!

15:41.482 --> 15:43.359
You've got a whole church.

15:44.109 --> 15:46.904
You should've told me sooner. Huh?

15:46.987 --> 15:48.697
We could've had a party to celebrate,

15:48.781 --> 15:52.785
tell everyone about the pastor
who used to deal meth.

16:07.091 --> 16:07.925
Shit!

16:10.094 --> 16:13.347
Son of a bitch! Nobody steals my money!

16:32.241 --> 16:33.826
It's great seeing you so much.

16:35.244 --> 16:38.706
We should meet more often.
Maybe twice a month? Yeah?

16:40.791 --> 16:42.209
You bastard.

16:53.929 --> 16:56.807
You are a tool of Satan himself!

17:05.607 --> 17:07.860
Die, you asshole!

17:07.943 --> 17:10.612
Do you know who you're dealing with?

17:10.696 --> 17:13.782
<i> It was becoming more difficult</i>
<i>for Jeon to stay in Korea.</i>

17:13.866 --> 17:16.410
<i>So he decided to find</i>
<i>a new base of operations</i>.

17:16.493 --> 17:20.539
<i>Somewhere small where there wouldn't be</i>
<i>any Koreans who knew him.</i>

17:20.622 --> 17:23.125
<i>But it would need to be a place</i>
<i>where he wouldn't stand out.</i>

17:23.208 --> 17:25.586
In a country rife with corruption.

19:24.705 --> 19:28.917
And this belonged to General Yi Sun-shin.

19:30.669 --> 19:34.423
One of the three greatest generals
in the world,

19:34.506 --> 19:37.050
along with Caesar and Napoleon.

19:37.134 --> 19:39.219
I'm sure you've heard of him.

19:50.898 --> 19:52.691
-Don't shoot!
-Drop the weapons!

19:52.774 --> 19:55.068
-I surrender!
-Down!

19:55.152 --> 19:58.488
<i>During the unrest,</i>
<i>Delano really needed cash.</i>

19:59.198 --> 20:02.951
<i>So he agreed to work with Jeon,</i>
<i>the ever shrewd businessman.</i>

20:03.035 --> 20:04.369
Number one!

20:04.453 --> 20:06.663
Everyone, remember to pick number one.

20:08.207 --> 20:12.127
There is
a large Chinese population in Suriname.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.504
If we get on his bad side,

20:14.588 --> 20:18.050
we could lose a lot of Chinese votes
to the, uh, opposition.

20:18.133 --> 20:22.012
But he only deals meth, so not a problem.

20:22.095 --> 20:26.600
Only you will have the exclusive right
to deal cocaine.

20:29.436 --> 20:30.270
Stop!

20:31.063 --> 20:32.397
-Shit!
-All of them here!

20:32.481 --> 20:33.649
<i>With Delano's help,</i>

20:33.732 --> 20:36.151
<i>Jeon wiped out</i>
<i>all of the small gangs in Suriname.</i>

20:36.818 --> 20:40.280
<i>And after acquiring the exclusive rights</i>
<i>to cocaine from Colombia,</i>

20:40.364 --> 20:42.074
<i>he got straight down to business.</i>

21:06.848 --> 21:09.643
Here. You will each swallow ten of these.

21:09.726 --> 21:13.438
Remember, this is God calling you
to help build his kingdom.

21:22.781 --> 21:27.035
<i> He used his female followers</i>
<i>as mules to smuggle drugs to Europe.</i>

21:27.119 --> 21:29.121
<i>And even when some of them were caught,</i>

21:29.663 --> 21:31.540
<i>they kept their mouth shut.</i>

21:31.623 --> 21:33.709
<i>Loyalty and faith will do that to you.</i>

21:38.046 --> 21:40.841
<i>He trained the men</i>
<i>to be his own private army.</i>

21:41.341 --> 21:44.261
<i>And even though he had moved</i>
<i>from meth to cocaine,</i>

21:44.344 --> 21:47.097
<i>he kept forcing his followers</i>
<i>to take his drugs.</i>

21:47.180 --> 21:50.142
<i>I guess he found it was the best way</i>
<i>to keep them obedient.</i>

21:50.225 --> 21:53.103
<i>And just like that,</i>
<i>Jeon had an army of hundreds of zealots</i>

21:53.186 --> 21:54.563
<i>willing to die for him.</i>

21:54.646 --> 21:57.941
<i>Before long, he became known</i>
<i>as Suriname's cocaine godfather.</i>

21:58.817 --> 22:01.236
The final judgement is coming, my friends!

22:01.320 --> 22:03.488
And so is the heaven on earth,

22:03.572 --> 22:04.698
promised to us in the bible,

22:04.781 --> 22:08.160
a place where Noah's descendants
will rescue troubled souls

22:08.243 --> 22:11.288
from their hardships
right here in Suriname!

22:11.371 --> 22:13.749
We will make heaven!

22:13.832 --> 22:15.292
Hallelujah!

22:15.375 --> 22:16.960
Hallelujah!

22:26.053 --> 22:28.513
What you're saying is that Pastor Jeon

22:28.597 --> 22:31.558
was the one who put the drugs in my skate
and got me locked up?

22:31.641 --> 22:32.684
Yeah.

22:33.393 --> 22:36.938
Jeon's main smuggling route
is currently limited to Europe.

22:37.022 --> 22:40.734
We believe that he plans
to expand his operations into Korea

22:40.817 --> 22:44.071
and that your shipping containers
were his initial test route, Mr. Kang.

22:44.154 --> 22:45.947
Oh shit.

22:55.082 --> 22:57.376
You know my friend Park Eungsoo?

22:57.459 --> 22:58.585
I don't know where he is.

23:03.507 --> 23:05.926
We took these messages
from your personal voicemail.

23:08.470 --> 23:09.679
<i>Ingu, it's Eungsoo.</i>

23:09.763 --> 23:12.557
<i>Call me when you get this.</i>

23:12.641 --> 23:14.267
<i>Hey, man. Where are you?</i>

23:14.935 --> 23:17.270
<i>You disappeared. Call me back.</i>

23:20.023 --> 23:22.901
<i>I got no idea what's going on, man.</i>
<i>Listen to this.</i>

23:22.984 --> 23:26.613
<i>I was in Chinatown today,</i>
<i>and I heard something crazy.</i>

23:27.906 --> 23:29.741
<i>You know Pastor Jeon?</i>

23:29.825 --> 23:33.745
<i>According to these guys,</i>
<i>he's a drug dealer. Crazy right?</i>

23:34.996 --> 23:36.581
<i>I mean, we actually met him.</i>

23:41.545 --> 23:42.963
He's still in Suriname then?

23:43.046 --> 23:45.257
I want to call him. Make sure he's okay.

23:52.973 --> 23:56.685
Your friend Mr. Park is dead.
I'm sorry, Mr. Kang.

24:05.277 --> 24:06.278
When?

24:08.780 --> 24:10.407
How could this happen?

24:11.366 --> 24:14.119
We believe that he was killed
by the pastor's men.

24:32.220 --> 24:33.597
My condolences.

24:52.032 --> 24:53.408
We'd like to arrest him,

24:53.492 --> 24:57.078
but Suriname and Korea
don't have an extradition treaty in place.

24:57.662 --> 25:00.540
Without one,
it's impossible for us to take him down.

25:01.458 --> 25:04.377
Which is why we need you
to help us with this, Mr. Kang.

25:13.803 --> 25:14.804
My help?

25:15.388 --> 25:17.098
You're here to ask me for my help?

25:18.099 --> 25:19.643
Well, it's more than that.

25:20.852 --> 25:22.354
We could help each other.

25:32.405 --> 25:35.784
If we want to arrest Jeon,
we have to get him out of the country.

25:35.867 --> 25:39.621
And since our operation to do just that
has already failed,

25:40.455 --> 25:41.915
the only option left

25:42.582 --> 25:46.002
is to somehow get him
to transport his product to the US.

25:46.795 --> 25:47.837
If he does,

25:47.921 --> 25:50.924
then they will mobilize
their military against him.

25:51.007 --> 25:52.759
Anyone caught smuggling to the US

25:52.842 --> 25:54.886
can be arrested
without foreign interference.

25:55.470 --> 25:58.390
If we could get him
to start shipping product to the States,

25:58.473 --> 26:01.268
it would be easy
to get the DEA involved in Suriname

26:01.351 --> 26:02.561
to arrest Yohan.

26:03.853 --> 26:06.022
So where do I fit in to all this?

26:06.106 --> 26:09.442
We want you to get closer to Yohan
back in Suriname.

26:09.943 --> 26:12.862
And convince him
to sell his cocaine in the US.

26:15.615 --> 26:17.284
We can help you, Mr. Kang.

26:17.367 --> 26:19.411
Our agent there will ensure your safety.

26:20.453 --> 26:22.497
And most importantly, when we catch him,

26:22.581 --> 26:25.125
all of the charges you're facing
will be dropped, of course.

26:26.918 --> 26:29.754
I'll be honest with you.
It sounds like suicide.

26:29.838 --> 26:31.673
You expect me to risk everything?

26:35.885 --> 26:36.720
Mr. Kang.

26:37.846 --> 26:40.348
Look. We're all out of other options here.

26:40.849 --> 26:42.309
Please help us.

26:42.392 --> 26:44.227
Help us get him behind bars.

26:49.024 --> 26:50.317
Agent Changho,

26:50.984 --> 26:54.029
you're saying I'm the only person
who can do this for you?

26:54.112 --> 26:55.739
Let's assume that's true.

26:55.822 --> 26:57.657
Why appeal to my sense of honor?

26:57.741 --> 26:59.576
Treat it like a business proposal.

27:00.410 --> 27:01.244
What?

27:01.328 --> 27:04.539
I used to have 500 million won.
That was my life savings.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.791
That money was supposed to be for my kids.

27:07.459 --> 27:09.836
Honestly,
I don't care at all about my life,

27:09.919 --> 27:12.839
but that money
is something I need to get back.

27:13.423 --> 27:15.258
Let me be straightforward here.

27:15.759 --> 27:18.595
You're hoping that I'll go back
and risk my life for you.

27:19.095 --> 27:22.349
And I'm prepared to do it,
but you've gotta give me something too.

27:22.432 --> 27:25.060
You get me 500 million, then…

27:25.977 --> 27:27.729
yeah, I'll help you.

27:34.319 --> 27:36.571
You got it. We'll do that deal.

27:39.574 --> 27:42.452
I hereby promise to Mr. Kang,
for his services,

27:42.535 --> 27:44.287
<i>200 million upon release,</i>

27:44.371 --> 27:46.748
<i>and a further three</i>
<i>once Yohan is in custody.</i>

27:46.831 --> 27:49.000
<i>This is Choi Changho of the NIS.</i>

27:53.546 --> 27:56.091
That's done. Where do I start?

27:58.051 --> 28:02.472
<i>Yohan's personal bodyguard</i>
<i>from Nigeria is also serving time here.</i>

28:03.682 --> 28:06.768
<i>For the next seven months,</i>
<i>until you're released,</i>

28:07.435 --> 28:09.813
<i>we're going to use him</i>
<i>to deceive Yohan.</i>

28:09.896 --> 28:11.314
How do I do that?

28:16.236 --> 28:18.321
<i>As soon as we get you the drugs,</i>

28:18.405 --> 28:20.323
<i>start distributing them in the prison.</i>

28:20.907 --> 28:21.741
Sir.

28:21.825 --> 28:24.077
<i>Convince them</i>
<i>that you've become a pusher.</i>

28:24.577 --> 28:25.662
You want more money?

28:31.501 --> 28:32.669
CABBAGE KIMCHI

28:32.752 --> 28:34.129
Isn't it food?

28:34.212 --> 28:35.714
It's not allowed in here.

28:35.797 --> 28:36.965
Then take it.

28:38.425 --> 28:40.635
This is good for your intestines.

29:21.134 --> 29:24.304
Son of a bitch. Selling drugs on my turf?

29:25.054 --> 29:26.681
Now you have to pay me.

29:40.153 --> 29:43.072
Remember to act nice.
Act like angels.

29:43.156 --> 29:45.158
If the French refuse to pay up,

29:45.867 --> 29:46.701
what did I tell you?

29:46.785 --> 29:47.994
Fight for the money!

29:48.077 --> 29:49.162
Right.

29:49.245 --> 29:53.833
Tomorrow, go to the French,
and fight for the money.

31:22.297 --> 31:23.423
Quit your acting.

32:23.316 --> 32:26.444
This is one of my colleagues.
She'll be helping us.

32:26.527 --> 32:28.613
-Hello.
-Hello, Mr. Kang.

32:34.285 --> 32:36.162
The money
will go to your wife's account.

32:36.245 --> 32:37.497
Two hundred million won.

32:37.580 --> 32:41.000
It'll be deposited in monthly installments
over the next ten months.

32:42.335 --> 32:43.920
No, that wasn't our agreement.

32:44.545 --> 32:48.174
-Give me what I asked for.
-Hold on. We've got to be smart.

32:48.800 --> 32:52.011
Caution is required
when transferring this much cash.

32:52.095 --> 32:53.137
I hope you understand.

32:54.889 --> 32:57.976
You don't trust me enough
to pay all at once, huh?

32:59.268 --> 33:00.103
Okay.

33:00.603 --> 33:04.065
But we make it five months,
and 40 million a month. Yeah?

33:04.148 --> 33:06.609
I don't want
to stay in Suriname for a year.

33:07.193 --> 33:11.030
Of the 40, you'll send 30 million to me
and the rest to Eungsoo's family.

33:12.615 --> 33:14.325
I'm sure they're having a tough time.

33:15.034 --> 33:16.953
All that sounds reasonable.

33:17.036 --> 33:19.956
The first thing we'll do is review
the steps we're going to take.

33:20.039 --> 33:23.209
In order to catch Yohan,
he'll need to export to the US.

33:23.292 --> 33:26.254
Whatever you say.
You're the one signing my paychecks.

33:27.547 --> 33:30.466
Pastor Jeon has control
of the Surinamese government,

33:30.550 --> 33:33.594
the police, and the army.
They're all in his pocket.

33:33.678 --> 33:36.973
He's in the process of building his empire
with the help of his followers,

33:37.056 --> 33:40.810
but he needs more cash,
so exporting to Korea is now his goal.

33:41.436 --> 33:42.687
This son of a bitch.

33:45.565 --> 33:49.402
This bastard stuffed my skate
with cocaine to try it out,

33:49.944 --> 33:51.738
but that blew up in his face.

33:53.322 --> 33:56.117
He still needs a way to export to Korea.

33:56.784 --> 33:59.245
Chen Zhen.
Head of the Chinese gang in Suriname.

33:59.328 --> 34:02.582
He does it all.
Smuggling, casinos, karaoke bars,

34:02.665 --> 34:05.793
extorting local fisherman,
anything that makes money.

34:05.877 --> 34:09.547
Primarily, he focuses on smuggling meth
to Chinatowns in Europe.

34:10.131 --> 34:14.135
But he's looking to increase his earnings,
and he's hoping to get into cocaine.

34:14.218 --> 34:16.304
And he just hasn't figured out how.

34:17.221 --> 34:20.058
So our plan is to use this point
to our advantage.

34:20.141 --> 34:21.392
How'd I do?

34:24.187 --> 34:26.689
Once you get through the first step,

34:26.773 --> 34:29.484
you'll be under direct threat
from Jeon Yohan, Mr. Kang.

34:29.567 --> 34:31.944
If things ever get too dangerous for you,

34:32.028 --> 34:34.322
drop everything and run to the US embassy.

34:34.989 --> 34:36.824
I won't get paid if I run.

34:42.371 --> 34:43.456
Hi, honey. It's me.

34:43.539 --> 34:45.583
<i>Where are you? At the airport?</i>

34:46.209 --> 34:47.877
<i>Are you on your way home?</i>

34:47.960 --> 34:50.546
Sweetheart, the thing is
something's come up.

34:51.047 --> 34:54.342
I need to stop by Suriname for work
before flying back to Korea.

34:54.425 --> 34:55.927
What do you mean?

34:56.469 --> 34:58.721
Why would you ever want to go back there?

34:59.222 --> 35:01.557
<i>A publisher sent me</i>
<i>30 million won yesterday.</i>

35:01.641 --> 35:02.725
<i>Is it because of that?</i>

35:02.809 --> 35:04.477
Yeah. They contacted me.

35:04.560 --> 35:07.021
They want me to help write a book
about my experiences

35:07.105 --> 35:09.357
on doing business in South America.

35:10.149 --> 35:13.069
They want me to go to Suriname
with the author to do research, honey.

35:13.152 --> 35:14.862
I don't believe you.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.489
Tell me what's really going on!

35:17.115 --> 35:20.660
I am telling you.
They've offered me really good money.

35:20.743 --> 35:21.994
How are the kids?

35:22.662 --> 35:23.579
<i>Honey</i>,

35:24.080 --> 35:25.581
I don't understand.

35:25.665 --> 35:28.000
Why won't you tell me what's going on?

35:31.170 --> 35:32.213
Who is she?

35:32.755 --> 35:34.465
Did you meet someone else?

35:35.258 --> 35:36.759
Oh no. Of course not.

35:36.843 --> 35:39.345
Then what's the real reason
you're going back there?

35:43.349 --> 35:46.853
I promise I'll explain everything
once I get back to Korea.

35:46.936 --> 35:48.062
<i>You trust me, right?</i>

35:50.022 --> 35:52.316
I have to stay behind
for five more months,

35:52.400 --> 35:54.235
so you use that money for the lease.

35:54.318 --> 35:55.778
I'll send more soon.

35:56.279 --> 35:58.322
Please keep the apartment for now.

36:00.449 --> 36:03.619
I want to talk to the kids.
The flight's gonna be boarding soon.

36:05.413 --> 36:06.289
Hi, Dad!

36:07.415 --> 36:09.834
Hyungju, Minseo. You both studying hard?

36:09.917 --> 36:11.252
<i>Yes!</i>

36:12.628 --> 36:15.840
Good. Now, Minseo, don't forget.
You're tae kwon do is going well,

36:15.923 --> 36:16.841
so be sure to practice.

36:16.924 --> 36:18.009
With practice,

36:18.092 --> 36:21.095
you'll be able to make a living one day
doing what you love, honey.

36:21.179 --> 36:23.639
Yes, Dad. Tae kwon do!

36:23.723 --> 36:25.516
I'm working on it really hard.

36:26.142 --> 36:27.977
Daddy, why are you not at home?

36:28.060 --> 36:31.189
It's because I want us
to have a happy life.

36:31.272 --> 36:33.107
So Daddy needs to take a tough path.

36:33.191 --> 36:34.275
At least for a while.

36:34.358 --> 36:36.944
Okay. Good luck with your tough path.

36:37.028 --> 36:38.905
Oh! Thank you, dear.

36:38.988 --> 36:41.407
I can't explain right now,
but I'll tell you when I can.

36:41.490 --> 36:43.576
I'm gonna tell you
everything when I get back.

36:43.659 --> 36:46.579
Until then,
I want you to be good and work hard.

36:46.662 --> 36:47.747
I'll know if you don't.

36:47.830 --> 36:51.626
I'm checking both your final report cards,
so you be good, yeah?

36:52.126 --> 36:53.419
Um, Dad.

36:54.462 --> 36:56.214
Just come home safe, okay?

36:58.382 --> 36:59.717
Of course I will.

37:00.301 --> 37:02.720
I'll be back with a lot of money for you.

37:04.305 --> 37:05.139
Bye.

Tell your boss the Korean fishman
has a great deal for him.

38:19.505 --> 38:20.423
Call him.

38:23.175 --> 38:25.386
Some Korean called Fishman is here.

38:26.053 --> 38:27.221
He's looking for the boss.

38:28.055 --> 38:29.223
What should I do?

38:30.349 --> 38:31.600
Follow me.

38:57.335 --> 39:00.129
Son of a bitch. He's adorable!

39:00.212 --> 39:01.213
Fucker.

39:12.433 --> 39:14.935
Wow. Fishman.

39:16.062 --> 39:17.646
Looking cool, huh?

39:17.730 --> 39:19.523
Long time no see.

39:25.529 --> 39:28.032
You got out of jail so fast.

39:28.115 --> 39:29.116
But,

39:29.825 --> 39:30.951
why are you here?

39:35.581 --> 39:36.415
What's going on?

39:36.499 --> 39:38.834
I asked you a question.

39:39.794 --> 39:41.212
Why are you here?

39:42.213 --> 39:43.089
Mmm.

39:44.757 --> 39:46.967
Why do people
from different countries meet?

39:47.718 --> 39:49.345
For war, or money.

39:53.599 --> 39:54.767
You want a war?

39:55.684 --> 39:57.436
No. Money.

39:58.020 --> 39:59.021
Shit!

39:59.105 --> 40:00.689
I have tons of money!

40:01.357 --> 40:02.650
Why would I work with you?

40:03.234 --> 40:05.903
How much are you really making
killing people?

40:06.404 --> 40:10.408
I see now why you always lose
to Pastor Jeon.

40:17.289 --> 40:20.167
What dirty plan did you have in mind? Hmm?

40:20.751 --> 40:21.794
Did Pastor send you?

40:22.503 --> 40:27.091
If you fuck me over,
I'll gut you like one of your skate fish.

40:29.593 --> 40:32.638
Because of the pastor, I went to prison.

40:32.721 --> 40:34.682
He killed my best friend.

40:35.850 --> 40:38.561
Not interested in money? Forget it.

40:39.770 --> 40:41.147
Your friend?

40:41.230 --> 40:42.940
I heard soldiers killed him.

40:43.023 --> 40:45.067
Tell me what you're getting at.

40:48.070 --> 40:48.946
I'm sorry.

40:49.613 --> 40:52.450
I feel fucking bad. Can't talk anymore.

40:53.242 --> 40:54.410
Just keep cutting.

41:01.959 --> 41:03.294
Boss is talking to you.

41:14.013 --> 41:15.890
Will this help you talk?

41:19.226 --> 41:21.937
Please forgive me, I beg you!

41:46.921 --> 41:49.089
What a fucking trader.

41:49.173 --> 41:52.092
Hang him up in Chinatown
to set a good example.

41:52.176 --> 41:53.594
-Sure.
-Sure.

41:57.723 --> 41:58.557
Come here.

41:59.183 --> 42:00.392
Let's talk again.

42:19.745 --> 42:20.955
You play blackjack?

42:22.498 --> 42:23.332
Sure.

42:25.292 --> 42:26.126
So…

42:26.794 --> 42:27.878
What's your plan?

42:29.505 --> 42:31.465
I want to sell dope in Korea.

42:31.549 --> 42:32.633
If you got it.

42:41.267 --> 42:42.643
Sure, I got it.

42:43.852 --> 42:45.521
You know I deal meth.

42:48.691 --> 42:50.025
I need cocaine.

42:50.651 --> 42:52.820
My meth can sell like crazy in Korea.

42:55.322 --> 42:59.159
Long ago,
Korea made money on three commodities.

42:59.243 --> 43:01.328
Cars, ships, and meth.

43:01.412 --> 43:02.246
But now…

43:02.830 --> 43:07.001
plenty of drugs come from Taiwan,
North Korea, Japan…

43:09.795 --> 43:10.796
Boss.

43:11.380 --> 43:14.133
Let's listen to what he has to say,
what do you think?

43:29.982 --> 43:32.151
No cocaine, no deal.

43:44.705 --> 43:46.081
I need one ton.

43:47.416 --> 43:48.542
You're crazy.

43:49.084 --> 43:51.503
Do you know how much a ton of coke costs?

43:51.587 --> 43:52.421
Sure.

43:53.255 --> 43:54.673
Call me when you get it.

43:57.092 --> 43:58.093
And…

43:59.136 --> 44:00.346
I need a gun.

44:06.852 --> 44:10.731
Chen Zhen says it'll take a few days,
but he's on board.

44:11.690 --> 44:14.985
Hey, you believe he's gonna give up
on the Korean market?

44:17.112 --> 44:20.491
Wow. It's been a while
since I've drunk this much.

44:28.582 --> 44:29.958
NIS SAFE HOUSE, BRAZIL

44:30.042 --> 44:33.962
Him selling cocaine will be like a license
to print money in Korea.

44:34.046 --> 44:37.633
Chen Zhen won't be able
to stop thinking about his profits.

44:37.716 --> 44:39.468
<i>That's exactly what I'm saying.</i>

44:39.968 --> 44:41.804
<i>There's too much for him to gain.</i>

44:41.887 --> 44:45.974
Anyway, go get a foot bath
and rest up while you're in Brazil.

44:46.058 --> 44:48.227
Okay. Take care, Sangman. Bye.

44:54.316 --> 44:56.318
You can all head out until we hear back.

44:56.902 --> 44:57.945
Go get some rest.

44:58.445 --> 44:59.321
Yes, sir.

46:25.699 --> 46:27.826
Chen Zhen. You get the cocaine?

46:55.854 --> 46:58.649
I think he's heading into Chinatown.

47:35.018 --> 47:36.186
Follow me.

47:56.039 --> 47:57.291
Too small.

47:58.125 --> 48:00.127
You think this is one ton?

48:02.129 --> 48:02.963
Look.

48:03.630 --> 48:06.842
How can I trust someone
who was friends with the pastor?

48:08.051 --> 48:09.845
I should just hand you a ton?

48:09.928 --> 48:12.514
You can trust money, yeah?

48:12.598 --> 48:13.932
This is way too small.

48:16.101 --> 48:18.270
You buy your coke
in Paramaribo backstreet?

48:18.896 --> 48:20.355
That's none of your business.

48:20.439 --> 48:21.940
Are you new to this? Huh?

48:25.777 --> 48:28.572
I want to know
if the supply and price are okay.

48:30.532 --> 48:31.909
Walk me through your setup.

48:33.201 --> 48:35.913
I told you, it's my business.

48:40.042 --> 48:41.585
You decide.

48:41.668 --> 48:44.129
Take it, or fucking leave it.

48:47.341 --> 48:48.425
CLOSED FOR THE DAY

49:22.209 --> 49:24.670
Byun Kitae!
What do you think you're doing?

49:25.295 --> 49:27.547
-Move out of the way.
-What?

49:27.631 --> 49:28.507
You're not my boss.

49:29.174 --> 49:31.426
What are you doing!

49:48.151 --> 49:50.737
Hey, hey, come on.

49:50.821 --> 49:52.280
Put down your gun.

49:53.907 --> 49:56.535
You are the one who broke our agreement.

49:57.119 --> 49:58.912
What the fuck did you say?

50:04.167 --> 50:06.003
The pastor let you sell meth.

50:06.086 --> 50:09.214
But now, you want to stab him in the back
by dealing coke too?

50:09.297 --> 50:11.133
It's not for Europe.

50:11.216 --> 50:13.010
Our target is Asia.

50:15.220 --> 50:17.806
You crazy bastard.

50:17.889 --> 50:19.433
Are you serious right now?

50:21.018 --> 50:21.852
All right.

50:22.561 --> 50:24.646
You and I still have matters to solve.

50:24.730 --> 50:26.273
What do you say we fight it out?

50:26.356 --> 50:27.899
You dirty traitor!

50:27.983 --> 50:29.985
You should be grateful
that we let you live!

50:30.068 --> 50:30.944
Fuck you!

50:35.032 --> 50:37.659
Hey, put your gun down.

50:38.243 --> 50:39.327
Stop.

50:41.038 --> 50:43.623
Breaking the agreement means war.

50:47.919 --> 50:51.548
Relax. None of us
are looking to start a war today.

50:52.632 --> 50:53.592
Byun Kitae.

50:54.426 --> 50:55.844
Listen to me carefully.

50:55.927 --> 50:59.222
If any of my boys lose
so much as a drop of blood today,

51:00.015 --> 51:01.641
I promise that'll be the start of a war.

51:05.979 --> 51:06.813
Hang on.

51:06.897 --> 51:10.650
Who the hell do you think you are
just barging in on us? Huh?

51:10.734 --> 51:11.985
We're working here.

51:14.571 --> 51:17.115
Mr. Kang, you need to come with us.

51:17.199 --> 51:18.492
To see the pastor.

51:21.995 --> 51:26.500
In Suriname, only the pastor
is allowed to deal coke.

51:27.167 --> 51:28.835
You broke our agreement.

51:28.919 --> 51:31.046
So, call it even.

51:31.880 --> 51:33.006
Got it?

51:33.090 --> 51:36.343
No one ever said I couldn't sell to Korea.

51:36.426 --> 51:37.594
I'm sorry, sir.

51:38.303 --> 51:40.889
Just admit you're a cult
and cut the bullshit.

51:40.972 --> 51:43.934
Who are you to go messing around
with his business?

51:44.518 --> 51:46.269
You'll accept the pastor's calling.

51:46.353 --> 51:49.397
And if I hear blasphemy coming
from your mouth ever again,

51:50.023 --> 51:51.775
you will be struck down.

51:54.653 --> 51:57.489
Mr. Kang,
you need to come with us right now.

51:57.572 --> 51:59.324
If you don't, you're dead.

51:59.407 --> 52:01.952
You don't want me
to have to ask again, okay?

52:03.537 --> 52:04.412
Hmm.

52:05.413 --> 52:07.666
Come on. Get him out of here.

52:12.379 --> 52:14.005
Fucking Koreans!

52:15.465 --> 52:17.717
What are you doing on my turf, huh?

52:17.801 --> 52:18.885
Fishman.

52:19.719 --> 52:21.138
Choose right now.

52:21.888 --> 52:23.974
Who will you do business with?

52:31.481 --> 52:32.858
To fix the situation,

52:33.483 --> 52:35.110
I will talk to them. Yeah?

52:38.572 --> 52:40.073
But don't forget.

52:40.157 --> 52:42.117
Our deal comes first.

52:44.828 --> 52:45.871
Fuck off.

52:47.080 --> 52:47.998
Okay.

52:49.291 --> 52:51.501
I don't know what the pastor wants,
but let's go.

52:51.585 --> 52:53.461
Good stuff. You made the right call.

52:54.171 --> 52:55.922
Do you know
what you're getting yourself into?

53:15.817 --> 53:18.862
Hey, I know you! Remember me?

53:19.446 --> 53:21.531
We were in the same prison. Right?

53:22.449 --> 53:23.366
No?

53:26.578 --> 53:27.412
Good.

53:31.708 --> 53:33.877
So, uh, were you in Suriname last year?

53:33.960 --> 53:35.212
Have we met before?

53:35.795 --> 53:37.005
For a while.

53:37.088 --> 53:38.924
I was in Colombia. Business trip.

53:39.007 --> 53:41.593
Ah, the cocaine supplier
is of there, right?

53:43.053 --> 53:45.388
I'd be happy to tell you everything.

53:45.472 --> 53:46.973
Except I won't.

53:48.433 --> 53:51.269
This kind of business intel
is need-to-know.

53:52.145 --> 53:53.521
If I told you,

53:53.605 --> 53:54.898
it could be dangerous.

53:55.899 --> 53:57.317
Hmm.

53:59.402 --> 54:00.362
Let's go.

55:31.411 --> 55:34.539
Oh good! Look at this. It's Brother Kang!

55:36.041 --> 55:37.500
It's been too long.

55:38.043 --> 55:39.586
Have you been doing well?

55:42.130 --> 55:43.798
You fucking serious?

55:44.841 --> 55:47.093
You think I've been doing well this year?

55:47.177 --> 55:48.428
You know I've been in jail?

55:49.137 --> 55:50.221
Brother.

55:51.306 --> 55:53.308
"Amen." Do you know what that means?

55:54.100 --> 55:56.061
It comes from the ancient Hebrew.

55:56.144 --> 55:59.064
In essence, it's,
"I hope that it comes to pass."

55:59.147 --> 56:02.275
Day in, day out, with all my heart,
I hoped and prayed

56:02.359 --> 56:04.319
that we would meet once more
in this life.

56:05.028 --> 56:08.114
And then my God answered my prayer. Amen.

56:08.198 --> 56:10.033
-Amen!
-Amen.

56:13.078 --> 56:15.747
See? That is why you're here.

56:15.830 --> 56:17.290
Right in front of me.

56:19.417 --> 56:20.752
Brother Kang.

56:22.504 --> 56:23.838
Let me ask you one thing.

56:24.506 --> 56:26.591
And if you're not honest with me,

56:26.674 --> 56:30.804
you will be struck down
in the glorious name of the Almighty.

56:34.015 --> 56:34.933
What is it?

56:37.769 --> 56:39.521
Why'd you come back to Suriname?

56:43.233 --> 56:45.985
Why do you think? For money, Pastor.

56:49.447 --> 56:53.159
I'm going to ask you that again,
and you will be truthful.

56:57.080 --> 56:58.164
Who can say?

57:02.210 --> 57:05.171
Why the fuck did you come back,
you little shit?
