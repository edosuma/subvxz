WEBVTT

00:01.037 --> 00:02.718
Hundreds of thousands of chefs

00:02.719 --> 00:05.436
all across America dream of
standing in front of

00:05.437 --> 00:06.885
these two doors.
Are you ready?

00:06.953 --> 00:08.507
Yes, Chef.
Yes, Chef.

00:08.575 --> 00:10.286
Each season on <i>Hell's Kitchen,</i>

00:10.354 --> 00:12.928
one door is unlocked,

00:12.996 --> 00:13.933
and the dream...

00:20.201 --> 00:21.638
You're the winner!

00:21.705 --> 00:23.714
Is fulfilled.

00:24.886 --> 00:26.353
Oh, my God!

00:26.421 --> 00:27.922
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

00:27.990 --> 00:29.262
<i>Hell's Kitchen</i> winner...
Nona!

00:29.330 --> 00:31.033
Whoo!

00:31.101 --> 00:34.346
Now...Opportunity is knocking

00:34.413 --> 00:36.419
on doors
all across America.

00:36.486 --> 00:38.890
"Congratulations.
You have been chosen to be..."

00:38.958 --> 00:40.864
A chef on <i>Hell's Kitchen!</i>

00:40.932 --> 00:42.305
I'm gonna win!

00:42.373 --> 00:44.210
I...Will...Dominate.

00:44.277 --> 00:46.547
Victory, Jersey,
fist pump, baby, yeah!

00:46.615 --> 00:49.425
This year, 18 chefs
from across America

00:49.493 --> 00:51.499
descend on <i>Hell's Kitchen,</i>

00:51.567 --> 00:53.572
hoping they have the qualities
they need to succeed.

00:53.640 --> 00:55.176
I hate losing.

00:55.244 --> 00:56.746
Like team spirit...

00:56.814 --> 00:57.880
You better
get outta my face.

00:57.948 --> 00:59.384
He can't cook me out!

00:59.452 --> 01:00.720
He can't even get
the risotto out!

01:00.787 --> 01:02.623
Work on your attitude!

01:02.691 --> 01:04.293
Intelligence...

01:04.361 --> 01:05.895
Why can't we just
reheat them?

01:05.962 --> 01:08.566
It's falling apart!
When are you gonna learn?

01:08.633 --> 01:10.101
<i>off.</i>
Diplomacy...

01:10.168 --> 01:11.638
Shut up
for five seconds!

01:11.705 --> 01:14.043
I will slap you
across the . Stupid.

01:14.111 --> 01:15.948
Humility...
Sorry. I'm sorry, Chef.

01:16.016 --> 01:17.618
I'm sorry, Chef.
I'm sorry, Chef.

01:17.686 --> 01:20.088
It's my fault, Chef.
I'm very sorry, Chef.

01:20.156 --> 01:21.983
Passion...

01:22.051 --> 01:23.886
This is what I've worked for
my whole life.

01:23.953 --> 01:24.888
I'm not just some
Pantry girl!

01:24.955 --> 01:26.256
Hold on.
Hoo-hoo.

01:26.325 --> 01:27.760
<i>Cry time?</i>

01:27.828 --> 01:29.765
Drive...
Tommy, talk to me!

01:29.833 --> 01:31.870
I work Hard
with them, for them--

01:31.938 --> 01:33.239
ohh!
I'm not giving up.

01:33.307 --> 01:34.608
Well, Fight back!

01:34.676 --> 01:36.078
I got it, Chef.
I got it.

01:36.145 --> 01:37.847
And an inquisitive nature.

01:37.915 --> 01:39.417
Let me ask you
a serious question right now.

01:39.484 --> 01:41.721
Do you take medication?

01:41.788 --> 01:43.390
Never before
has a group of chefs

01:43.458 --> 01:45.360
been so hungry for victory.

01:45.428 --> 01:46.462
I never Quit!

01:46.530 --> 01:48.465
I signed up to win.

01:48.533 --> 01:51.904
Never before has Chef Ramsay
been so demanding.

01:51.972 --> 01:53.708
It's raw!
It's burnt!

01:53.775 --> 01:55.578
It's raw!
Pathetic!

01:55.646 --> 01:57.648
This is embarrassing!

02:00.653 --> 02:02.556
It's the most
volatile season yet.

02:02.624 --> 02:04.527
Hang your heads in shame!
Wow!

02:04.595 --> 02:07.733
These chefs will find out
when they enter these doors...

02:07.800 --> 02:09.703
It is a living hell.

02:09.770 --> 02:11.205
That they're
about to be pushed harder...

02:11.273 --> 02:12.173
Aah!

02:12.240 --> 02:14.376
Than any chefs before.

02:14.444 --> 02:16.580
Oh, no!
No!

02:16.647 --> 02:17.882
It's disgusting!
Chef, I--

02:17.949 --> 02:19.117
shut up!
Let's go, you!

02:19.185 --> 02:23.054
Three minutes, I said!
Shut up!

02:23.122 --> 02:24.724
You want me to get out,
then I'll get out!
Get out!

02:24.792 --> 02:26.326
Get out!
Oh, my God!

02:26.395 --> 02:28.129
What are you gonna do now?
Any suggestions?

02:28.197 --> 02:31.234
Shut it down.

02:31.301 --> 02:32.334
Shut it down.

02:40.478 --> 02:41.878
I'm starting to understand

02:41.946 --> 02:43.613
why they call it
Hell's Kitchen.

02:46.818 --> 02:48.586
Welcome, everybody.
I'm James.

02:48.654 --> 02:50.789
I'm the maitre d'
here at Hell's Kitchen.

02:50.857 --> 02:52.692
So are you excited
to go to Hell's Kitchen?

02:54.128 --> 02:56.697
Oh! I can't wait
to start cooking.

02:56.765 --> 02:58.533
I'm a rock star
in my own world,

02:58.601 --> 03:00.468
so being here and being
treated like a rock star

03:00.536 --> 03:03.038
isn't really
that much of a difference.

03:03.106 --> 03:04.073
Where are we?
Ramsay's house.

03:06.177 --> 03:08.379
I am the hottest chef in the
hottest restaurant in Dallas.

03:08.447 --> 03:10.582
Me and Chef Ramsay'll be
like that.

03:10.649 --> 03:12.584
Watch out.

03:12.652 --> 03:13.853
<i>I walk tall, take 'em all,</i>

03:13.920 --> 03:15.221
big or small, I never fall.

03:15.289 --> 03:16.756
<i>I'm here to win it, baby.</i>

03:16.824 --> 03:18.959
Everybody likes to have
a good time,

03:19.027 --> 03:20.961
but it's not, "let's try to
be nice and hold hands

03:21.029 --> 03:22.596
and be friends."

03:22.664 --> 03:24.499
It's me versus you,
and I'm gonna steamroll you.

03:24.567 --> 03:26.201
While the chefs are anxious

03:26.269 --> 03:27.536
to have their first taste
of Hell's Kitchen...

03:27.604 --> 03:29.706
<i>Hell's Kitchen--</i> what?

03:29.773 --> 03:32.877
Chef Ramsay has decided to give
them an unexpected detour.

03:32.944 --> 03:34.679
We pulled up outside,

03:34.747 --> 03:36.682
and it was like,
"Welcome, <i>Hell's Kitchen</i> chefs."

03:36.749 --> 03:39.085
What?
Like what is going on?

03:39.152 --> 03:41.921
Guys, so it looks like
we've arrived.

03:41.989 --> 03:43.357
Let's go.
Off the bus, please.

03:43.425 --> 03:44.992
Let's go!

03:45.060 --> 03:46.728
I was super-excited
and nervous,

03:46.796 --> 03:48.196
like, what's going on?
Like, holy !

03:48.264 --> 03:50.132
Chefs are coming through.
Watch the leads.

03:50.200 --> 03:51.733
Watch out, hot pan.
One, two, three.

03:51.801 --> 03:53.700
Go to hair and makeup.
Let's go!

03:53.768 --> 03:55.467
You gonna make me
look good, girl?

03:55.535 --> 03:57.035
All of a sudden
we're getting hair and makeup.

03:57.103 --> 03:59.236
It was insane...I mean,
is this how a superstar feels?

03:59.303 --> 04:00.836
Oh, my God!
I love it.

04:00.903 --> 04:02.903
You guys ready
to head upstairs?

04:02.971 --> 04:04.937
Good luck.
Thanks!

04:05.005 --> 04:06.471
You're gonna need it.

04:06.539 --> 04:07.939
Good luck, everybody.

04:08.007 --> 04:09.207
We hear like a crowd
in the background.

04:09.274 --> 04:13.274
Everyone's getting so excited!
Yeah!

04:13.342 --> 04:15.109
<i>Two minutes.</i>
<i>You ready?</i>

04:15.177 --> 04:17.011
What the hell
is going on here?

04:17.077 --> 04:18.712
We are not really gonna cook
our signature dishes

04:18.779 --> 04:20.647
for all these people.
30 seconds!

04:20.714 --> 04:22.481
For a lot of people out there
to just see us...

04:22.549 --> 04:24.149
Damn, this is like
the real deal.

04:24.217 --> 04:25.850
Ladies and gentlemen,

04:25.918 --> 04:28.052
welcome to the Orpheum Theater.

04:28.120 --> 04:30.654
Please put
your hands together

04:30.722 --> 04:32.456

04:51.803 --> 04:53.136
<i>Seriously...</i>

04:53.204 --> 04:54.536
What on earth did you expect?

04:54.604 --> 04:56.005
<i>A packed house?</i>

04:56.072 --> 04:57.674
<i>A standing ovation?</i>

04:57.741 --> 05:00.142
Screaming fans?
Really?

05:00.210 --> 05:01.577
<i>Right now,</i>

05:01.645 --> 05:03.178
none of you are stars.

05:03.246 --> 05:06.382
Resumes...Mean nothing!

05:06.450 --> 05:08.384
<i>Got it?</i>
Yes, Chef.

05:08.452 --> 05:10.552
Got it?
Yes, Chef!

05:10.619 --> 05:11.952
Un--Real.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.620
I felt like I was getting
berated.

05:13.688 --> 05:15.221
I wanted to just be like,

05:15.289 --> 05:17.023
"Oh, we're unworthy,
we're unworthy."

05:17.091 --> 05:20.027
But then it was like, boom,
back down to earth.

05:20.095 --> 05:22.132
I'm looking for someone
to emerge

05:22.200 --> 05:23.633
<i>and prove to me</i>

05:23.701 --> 05:26.135
that they're worthy
of being called a star.

05:26.203 --> 05:28.170
Because this season
of <i>Hell's Kitchen</i>

05:28.237 --> 05:30.104

05:30.172 --> 05:33.073

05:43.716 --> 05:44.915
New York City.

05:47.152 --> 05:49.586
You know, I know
I'm from down south, but...

05:49.654 --> 05:51.921
Absolutely ready to handle

05:57.993 --> 05:59.327
It blew my mind.

06:12.670 --> 06:14.337
I'm from New York City.

06:14.404 --> 06:17.005
I couldn't have wished
for a more perfect scenario.

06:17.073 --> 06:18.841
Get your asses
back to Hell's Kitchen

06:18.909 --> 06:21.677

06:24.380 --> 06:26.381
<i>Got it?</i>
Yes, Chef.

07:44.699 --> 07:46.265
My name is Elise.

07:46.333 --> 07:48.032
I am from Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania.

07:48.100 --> 07:50.432
I am definitely not afraid
to fight back.

07:50.500 --> 07:52.067
Scared?
Are you scared?

07:52.135 --> 07:53.569
They better watch themselves.
It's good.

07:53.636 --> 07:55.137
It's good.
Why are you still talking?

07:55.205 --> 07:56.338
I don't know.
We playing like that?

07:56.406 --> 07:58.741
When you got 250k on the line,

07:58.808 --> 08:01.076
like I will elbow my mom
outta my way.

08:01.144 --> 08:02.611
<i>20 minutes to go.</i>

08:04.280 --> 08:06.214
Coming down the line.
Actually being in Hell's Kitchen

08:06.282 --> 08:07.615
and cooking
your signature dish,

08:07.683 --> 08:08.950
it's a little surreal
at first.

08:09.018 --> 08:10.252
Hot behind.
Behind, behind, behind.

08:10.319 --> 08:11.587
But when it comes down to it,

08:11.655 --> 08:13.357
it's the same ,
different toilet,

08:13.424 --> 08:15.058
you know what I'm saying,
same bologna, different bread.

08:15.125 --> 08:15.691
If you want a bowl,
the bowls are up in the back.

08:15.759 --> 08:17.192
Thank you.

08:17.260 --> 08:18.660

My competitors will absolutely
be intimidated by me.

08:24.968 --> 08:27.736
As soon as I walk into a room,
every eye is on me.

08:27.804 --> 08:29.504
It's just something--
some aura that I give off.

08:29.572 --> 08:30.972
Down the line.

08:31.040 --> 08:32.673
Three minutes go to!
'Scuse me.

<i>I don't know</i>

08:35.275 --> 08:37.409
You better not knock
my plate over.

08:37.477 --> 08:39.346
I got a little nervous
and I got a little frazzled.

08:39.414 --> 08:40.215
And it felt like
those 45 minutes

08:40.282 --> 08:42.451
went by like that.

08:42.518 --> 08:45.052
15 seconds to go.

08:45.120 --> 08:47.588
<i>5, 4,</i>

08:47.656 --> 08:49.323
<i>3, 2,</i>

08:49.391 --> 08:51.124
<i>1...</i>

08:51.192 --> 08:52.258
<i>And serve! Yes?</i>

08:52.326 --> 08:53.826
Yes, Chef!

08:57.030 --> 08:59.730
The signature dishes
are a chance for you to shine

08:59.797 --> 09:01.530
and stand out
as individuals.

09:01.598 --> 09:03.966
But...This is actually
your first team challenge.

09:04.033 --> 09:05.834
<i>The men's dishes</i>
<i>will go head-to-head</i>

09:05.901 --> 09:06.901
<i>with the ladies' dishes.</i>

09:06.969 --> 09:08.136
Let's get 'em, boys.

09:08.203 --> 09:10.171
Excellent. Let's go.

09:10.239 --> 09:12.207
First up in the signature
dish challenge...

09:12.274 --> 09:13.775
Carrie, the Pantry Chef
from Dallas, Texas,

09:13.843 --> 09:16.977
will face off against Will,
a Sous Chef from New Jersey.

09:17.045 --> 09:18.678
Ladies first.
What is it?

09:18.746 --> 09:20.946
It is a chicken-fried rib-eye,
with Yukon gold mash

09:21.014 --> 09:22.647
and white truffle cream
gravy.

09:22.715 --> 09:24.215
I actually have
a little sugar in there.

09:24.283 --> 09:25.483
Stop. Say that again.

09:25.551 --> 09:26.917
<i>I have sugar in there.</i>

09:26.985 --> 09:28.685
That's what my mother
always did!

09:28.753 --> 09:30.320
I do not know who,
in their right mind,

09:30.388 --> 09:32.789
would put sugar
in mashed potatoes.

09:32.856 --> 09:33.956
Just try it.

09:34.024 --> 09:35.825
Chef Ramsay is gonna love it,

09:35.892 --> 09:37.593
because it's delicious.

09:37.661 --> 09:38.494
It's like an orgasm
in your mouth--come on.

09:40.663 --> 09:41.763
Oh, God.

09:41.831 --> 09:42.897
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

09:42.965 --> 09:43.998
I don't mean to laugh.

09:44.066 --> 09:45.300
That...is disgusting.

09:45.367 --> 09:47.468
Okay. First name.

09:47.536 --> 09:48.536
Will from North Jersey.

09:48.603 --> 09:50.504
Heritage--Italian?

09:50.572 --> 09:52.172
Italian and Jewish.
I grew up--

09:52.239 --> 09:53.773
my friends
called me a pizza bagel.

09:53.841 --> 09:55.775
Okay. What is it?
It is sheep's milk gnudi.

09:55.843 --> 09:56.977
I'm a technician
when it comes to culinary,

09:57.044 --> 09:58.578
you know what I'm saying?

09:58.646 --> 10:00.447
I don't worry about
somebody eating my food.

10:00.515 --> 10:01.748
I do it,
and I do it right.

10:03.384 --> 10:05.518
Um, that is delicious.
Thanks, Chef.

10:05.586 --> 10:06.819
<i>Great job.</i>
Thanks, Chef.

10:06.887 --> 10:08.954
A point
to the pizza bagel.

10:09.022 --> 10:10.156
<i>Congratulations.</i>
<i>Well done.</i>

10:10.223 --> 10:11.157
All right, Will.

10:11.224 --> 10:12.726
Wow.

10:12.793 --> 10:13.727
Next two, please.
Let's go.

10:16.431 --> 10:18.531
Um, right, first name is?
Amanda.

10:18.599 --> 10:20.232
What's the dish?

10:20.299 --> 10:22.400
This is eggplant rollatini
with creamy polenta.

10:25.568 --> 10:27.534
This is seasoned perfectly.
Thank you, Chef.

10:27.602 --> 10:29.370
There's talent there.
Good job.

10:29.437 --> 10:31.673
That's
High praise coming from him.

10:31.741 --> 10:32.941
I'm on cloud nine
right now.

10:33.009 --> 10:34.343
Okay. So first name is...

10:34.411 --> 10:36.378
Brendan.
Brendan. What is it?

10:36.445 --> 10:38.212
<i>It's a recipe I hope</i>
<i>that you recognize.</i>

10:38.280 --> 10:39.946
This is salmon
with a basil cream sauce.

10:40.014 --> 10:41.747
This came from
Harvey's Restaurant

10:41.815 --> 10:43.349
<i>where you were a cook.</i>
<i>That's right.</i>

10:43.417 --> 10:44.617
That's why I wanted
to make it for you.

10:44.684 --> 10:46.251
I did a lot of research,

10:46.319 --> 10:48.319
and I really wanted to show
Chef Ramsay

10:48.387 --> 10:50.087
that I'm the type of guy
that will go the extra distance.

10:50.155 --> 10:51.889
I mean,
the salmon's cooked perfectly.

10:51.957 --> 10:53.257
<i>Sauce is seasoned nice.</i>
<i>Congratulations.</i>

10:53.325 --> 10:54.491
To both of you.

10:54.559 --> 10:55.992
You both got the point.

10:56.060 --> 10:57.127
Well done.

10:57.194 --> 10:58.694
Next two, please.

11:00.363 --> 11:02.064
Uh, ladies first.
First name is...

11:02.132 --> 11:03.663
Jennifer.
Jennifer.
From where?

11:03.731 --> 11:05.031
Boston, Massachusetts.
What's the dish?

11:05.099 --> 11:06.867
It's called Jenny's pork.

11:06.934 --> 11:08.702
It's my special marinade
on my pork.

11:09.938 --> 11:12.273
Please, Chef Ramsay,

11:12.340 --> 11:14.441
please do not spit out
my food.

11:18.179 --> 11:20.980
It's not bad.
The pork's moist and tasty.

11:21.047 --> 11:22.981
Thank you.

11:23.049 --> 11:25.217
Someone up above answered me.
It didn't suck.

11:25.284 --> 11:27.318
Pork's actually
quite nice.

11:27.386 --> 11:29.786
Jonathon from where?
Memphis, Tennessee.

11:29.853 --> 11:31.754
What the
Is that on the plate?

11:31.822 --> 11:33.489
Call this
the punch drunk chicken.

11:33.557 --> 11:34.724
I got the southern flavor,
you know?

11:34.791 --> 11:36.225
I put a lotta flavor
in the food,

11:36.293 --> 11:38.260
raw but real, so...

11:38.327 --> 11:39.927
If Chef Ramsay
complains about it,

11:39.995 --> 11:41.228
well, he's full of
, man.

11:41.296 --> 11:42.762
Hold on, it gets worse.

11:42.830 --> 11:45.598
The pineapple
looks like...canned?

11:45.667 --> 11:47.435
Yes.

11:47.503 --> 11:49.071
You open a can of pineapple

11:49.139 --> 11:51.573
and you stick it
on top of a chicken.

11:51.641 --> 11:52.807
Limited time today.

11:52.875 --> 11:54.108
Limited time!

11:55.511 --> 11:56.810
<i>45 minutes.</i>

11:56.878 --> 11:58.712
Limited time.
Yes, sir.

11:58.780 --> 12:02.415
You're so full of ,
even your eyes are brown.

12:02.483 --> 12:05.451
You come in here and serve me
a canned pineapple.

12:05.519 --> 12:07.919
<i>You can off now.</i>

12:07.987 --> 12:10.621
Serious.
I'll pay for the ticket.

12:10.688 --> 12:12.956
You tell me.

12:14.158 --> 12:15.992
<i>Forget it.</i>

12:18.799 --> 12:20.966
It's the signature dish
challenge,

12:21.034 --> 12:22.834
and Jonathon,
a head cook from Memphis,

12:22.902 --> 12:25.570
has just broken
one of the cardinal rules.

12:25.637 --> 12:28.305
You come in and serve me
a canned pineapple.

12:28.373 --> 12:29.807
<i>You can off now.</i>

12:29.875 --> 12:31.209
<i>Serious.</i>

12:31.276 --> 12:32.210
You tell me.

12:32.278 --> 12:33.477
No, sir.

12:33.545 --> 12:35.512
It's an absolute,
mess.

12:35.580 --> 12:37.914
But the surprising fact was
you opened it out of a can.

12:37.982 --> 12:40.383
That's what pissed me off
more than anything.

12:40.451 --> 12:41.684
<i>I'm not even gonna taste it.</i>

12:41.752 --> 12:43.219
Ladies, congratulations.

12:45.789 --> 12:47.689
Let's go.
Next two, please.

12:47.757 --> 12:49.725
<i>Let's go, buddy.</i>

12:51.027 --> 12:53.927
Right. First name
and, uh,

12:53.995 --> 12:55.228
what in the hell
is that on there?

12:55.296 --> 12:56.629
<i>My name is Krupa.</i>

12:56.697 --> 12:59.532
This is a traditional
gujarati dish of stuffed naan.

12:59.600 --> 13:02.201
First off--doesn't exactly
look appetizing, does it?

13:02.269 --> 13:04.169
No.
<i>No. It's like you've got</i>

13:04.237 --> 13:07.338
four bits of
on a plate--splat.

13:07.406 --> 13:09.407
You're right.

13:10.609 --> 13:13.043
Spices are raw, bland.

13:13.111 --> 13:14.645
<i>My dear Krupa, yeah?</i>

13:14.712 --> 13:15.779
That is crappa.

13:15.847 --> 13:17.614
Wow.

13:17.682 --> 13:18.815
He thought of me as a joke.

13:18.883 --> 13:20.550
I'm better than this.

13:20.617 --> 13:23.586
I'm so much more
better than this.

13:23.653 --> 13:25.187
Uh, right.
First name is...

13:25.255 --> 13:26.721
Paul.
Paul.
What's the dish?

13:26.789 --> 13:29.023
It's an eggplant involtini with
crab and mascarpone ricotta.

13:31.593 --> 13:33.493
It's actually quite nice.
Thank you, Chef.

13:33.561 --> 13:34.761
<i>You're a natural cook.</i>
<i>Congratulations.</i>

13:34.829 --> 13:36.128
The gents.
Good job.

13:36.196 --> 13:37.796
Slam dunk.

13:37.864 --> 13:39.464
Next two.
Let's go, please.

13:39.532 --> 13:40.799
First name.
Jamie.

13:40.866 --> 13:42.400
What do you do?
I'm a Sous Chef.

13:42.468 --> 13:44.371
You're already a Sous Chef?
Yes.

13:44.439 --> 13:46.974
I'm still a young chef,
but I know how good I am.

13:47.041 --> 13:49.409
Tell me about the dish.
It's lamb lollipops

13:49.477 --> 13:51.344
<i>with a red onion</i>
<i>confiture.</i>

13:51.412 --> 13:52.979
Mm-hmm.

13:53.047 --> 13:55.782
You've overcooked the most
important thing, the lamb.

13:55.850 --> 13:57.317
If you're gonna have
the balls

13:57.384 --> 13:58.517
to call yourself
a Sous Chef,

13:58.585 --> 14:00.852
learn to cook lamb
properly first.

14:00.920 --> 14:02.854
Yes, Chef.

14:02.922 --> 14:04.725
Okay, uh...
Steven.

14:04.793 --> 14:06.960
What is that?

14:07.028 --> 14:09.062
I have seared diver scallops
over wild mushroom risotto.

14:09.129 --> 14:10.663
I've been cooking 30 years.

14:10.731 --> 14:12.531
Nobody else has a chance
in this thing.

14:12.599 --> 14:15.002
Honestly, it's like toenails
from a Dinosaur.

14:16.271 --> 14:17.470
Look at them!

14:17.537 --> 14:18.571
<i>It's got good flavor.</i>

14:18.638 --> 14:21.106
It's got good flavor.

14:21.174 --> 14:22.640
<i>You can't be that deluded.</i>

14:22.708 --> 14:25.475
The point goes to...
None of you.

14:25.543 --> 14:26.976
Stop around.

14:27.044 --> 14:28.478
Sorry, Chef.

14:28.546 --> 14:30.846
Okay. Let's go.

14:30.914 --> 14:33.515
After two disappointing
dishes, line cook Elise...

14:33.582 --> 14:36.384
Your scallops
are cooked perfectly.
Thank you, Chef.

14:36.452 --> 14:38.620
Takes on New Jersey
Executive Chef Chino.

14:38.688 --> 14:41.055
The miso is so strong,
and it doesn't really sit well.

14:41.123 --> 14:42.524
Well done, Elise.

14:42.591 --> 14:44.626
And Elise ties it
for the red team.

14:44.693 --> 14:46.093
Next two, please.

14:46.161 --> 14:48.095
Thank you.
Now line cook Monterray...

14:48.163 --> 14:50.563
The sea bass you've nailed.
Thank you, sir.

14:50.631 --> 14:52.632
Squares off against Kentucky
Sous Chef Natalie.

14:52.699 --> 14:54.400
<i>The lamb is perfect.</i>
Thank you, Chef.

14:54.468 --> 14:56.269
Congratulations.
You both got the point.

14:56.336 --> 14:58.003
<i>Okay, let's go.</i>
<i>Both, please, let's go.</i>

14:58.071 --> 15:00.572
With the score tied at four,
line cook Elizabeth...

15:00.640 --> 15:02.507
It's got that impact.

15:02.575 --> 15:04.642
Makes an impression
on Chef Ramsay.

15:04.710 --> 15:06.243
<i>It works.</i>
<i>The dish works.</i>

15:06.311 --> 15:08.712
While line cook Tommy...

15:08.780 --> 15:11.414
The tattoo on the forehead,
could you just lift up

15:11.482 --> 15:13.983
so I can have a quick look,
if you don't mind.
Says rock and roll.

15:14.051 --> 15:15.284
Makes an impression of his own.
So I've gotta take you serious.

15:15.352 --> 15:16.953
I'd appreciate it
if you did.

15:18.955 --> 15:20.989
There's finesse in there.
It tastes nice.

15:21.057 --> 15:22.690
Thank you.

15:22.758 --> 15:24.192
Point's going to
both of you.

15:24.259 --> 15:25.993
<i>Well done.</i>
<i>Well done.</i>

15:26.061 --> 15:27.762
Let's go.
<i>Come on, Jason.</i>

15:27.829 --> 15:30.130
<i>Last chance.</i>
Now, with the score tied,

15:30.198 --> 15:32.099
it all comes down
to the last two dishes.

15:32.167 --> 15:33.566
What's the dish?

15:33.634 --> 15:36.903
This is pan-roasted
pistachio scallops

15:36.970 --> 15:39.172
with pureed parsnip.

15:39.239 --> 15:40.873
<i>The actual scallops,</i>
<i>they taste nice,</i>

15:40.941 --> 15:42.141
but you've burnt
the top of them.

15:42.209 --> 15:43.909
Yes, my scallops
were a little bit burnt.

15:43.977 --> 15:46.178
But he said they tasted good.

15:46.246 --> 15:47.580
I was kind of
in a panic.

15:47.647 --> 15:49.148
What is it?

15:49.216 --> 15:51.583
It's a pork taco.

15:51.651 --> 15:52.818
<i>Why would you choose</i>
<i>to do a taco</i>

15:52.885 --> 15:54.517
on a day like today?

15:54.585 --> 15:56.851
Uh...'Cause it's delicious.

15:56.919 --> 15:58.686
Me being the last person up

15:58.754 --> 16:02.022
and knowing that I am
just bringing up tacos...

16:02.089 --> 16:03.623
I was so nervous!

16:03.691 --> 16:06.359
I-I--belie--I--

16:06.427 --> 16:08.161
personally believe
it's very delicious,

16:08.229 --> 16:10.396
<i>and I hope that you'll</i>
<i>feel the same.</i>

16:10.463 --> 16:11.897
<i>Oh, me.</i>

16:11.965 --> 16:13.565
It's gonna be great.

16:13.632 --> 16:14.999
Well, let's do it properly,
then, shall we?

16:22.573 --> 16:23.840
Point goes to...

16:25.542 --> 16:26.975
Come on, come on,
come on.

16:29.111 --> 16:31.145
Gentlemen.
Good job.

16:31.213 --> 16:33.247
That a boy, Jason.

16:33.315 --> 16:35.548
Looks a mess,
yet it tastes delicious.

16:35.616 --> 16:37.149
Thank you, Chef.
<i>Good job.</i>

16:37.217 --> 16:38.517
This is huge!

16:38.585 --> 16:40.152
I pulled off a win
with some tacos.

16:40.219 --> 16:41.920
Such an awesome feeling.

16:41.987 --> 16:44.488
Well done.

16:44.555 --> 16:45.688
<i>Okay.</i>

16:45.756 --> 16:47.490
Gents, you'll be treated

16:47.557 --> 16:49.925
to a unique feast

16:49.993 --> 16:52.361
in one of the hottest
restaurants in downtown L.A.,

16:52.429 --> 16:55.564
wining and dining
with last season's winner

16:55.632 --> 16:57.199
of <i>Hell's Kitchen,</i> Nona.

16:57.267 --> 16:59.434
<i>How's that sound?</i>
Excellent, Chef.

16:59.502 --> 17:00.968
<i>Good.</i>

17:01.036 --> 17:05.039
Okay, ladies, you've got
one miserable, horrible evening.

17:05.107 --> 17:08.375
You'll be preparing
Hell's Kitchen for the opening,

17:08.443 --> 17:09.976
cleaning both kitchens.

17:10.044 --> 17:11.243
<i>Got it?</i>

17:11.310 --> 17:12.410
Yes, Chef.
Yes, Chef.

17:12.478 --> 17:13.411
<i>Good.</i>

17:13.479 --> 17:14.979
Let's go.

17:19.184 --> 17:21.318
After claiming
their first victory,

17:21.386 --> 17:24.121
the men head tLAla Market
at L.A. live...

17:24.188 --> 17:25.555
This is awesome!

17:25.623 --> 17:26.923
To meet with last season's
winner...

17:26.991 --> 17:28.424
Nona!

17:28.492 --> 17:30.692
It felt really good
to see Nona.

17:30.760 --> 17:32.292
It was inspirational.

17:32.360 --> 17:33.660
Ow!

17:33.728 --> 17:36.129
How are you?
Great, great.
How are you doing?

17:36.197 --> 17:38.932
<i>I got ripped apart tonight.</i>
Yeah, that's okay.
So did I.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.201
Every day when you
go in there, and you fight,

17:41.269 --> 17:43.269
and you put your best
foot forward every day,

17:43.337 --> 17:45.904
you have to remember
that this for your life.

17:45.972 --> 17:48.206
It's not just fun and games.

17:48.274 --> 17:50.675
Sitting and talking to Nona
kinda gave me an extra boost.

17:50.742 --> 17:52.877
I listened to everything she
said and I took it to heart,

17:52.944 --> 17:55.078
and I'm just gonna use that
to my advantage.

17:55.146 --> 17:57.046
Let's have a toast
to the women.

17:57.114 --> 17:59.148
They're scrubbing our mess.
<i>Go blue!</i>

18:02.285 --> 18:03.318
What is that?

18:03.386 --> 18:04.852
The kitchen looks like

18:04.920 --> 18:06.854
a tornado
went through it.

18:06.921 --> 18:08.388
There's no room for anything

18:08.456 --> 18:11.023
because there are
so many dishes.

18:11.091 --> 18:13.058
I put points on the board.

18:13.126 --> 18:15.127
And I'm still
mopping.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.729
I'm a little upset
that I'm here cleaning,

18:16.797 --> 18:18.064
because I earned my point.

18:18.131 --> 18:19.731
That's right.
I won.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.767
Krupa and Carrie
sunk our team.

18:21.834 --> 18:23.402
<i>If it wasn't for those two,</i>

18:23.470 --> 18:25.904
we would be out eating
dinner right now.

18:25.972 --> 18:27.139
!

18:28.807 --> 18:30.208
It's the end of the first day

18:30.276 --> 18:32.343
in Hell's Kitchen.

18:32.411 --> 18:34.945
And with the grand reopening of
the restaurant awaiting them...

18:35.012 --> 18:36.480
Here we go.
The aspiring chefs

18:36.548 --> 18:37.981
are anxious to start their prep.

18:38.049 --> 18:39.883
This is our first service.

18:39.951 --> 18:42.719
The nerves are building, man.
The tension is building.

18:42.786 --> 18:44.253
But all in all,

18:44.321 --> 18:46.122
I think we're just gonna
dominate the red team.

18:46.189 --> 18:47.556
Morning, Chef.
How we all doing today?

18:47.624 --> 18:49.458
Great, Chef.

18:49.526 --> 18:52.094
We provided you with your
own J.A. Henckels knife sets.

18:52.162 --> 18:53.829
Each one of you have a set.

18:53.897 --> 18:55.364
Oh, my God!

18:55.431 --> 18:57.198
Those Henckel knives
are the bomb.

18:58.634 --> 19:00.902
These knives are sharp.
Let's go, ladies.

19:00.969 --> 19:02.370
<i>Let's get it together.</i>

19:02.438 --> 19:04.105
Crank it up. Regroup.

19:04.173 --> 19:05.906
We lost 'cause of
my horrible dish.

19:05.974 --> 19:07.808
I'm hoping I will be able
to shine today,

19:07.875 --> 19:10.743
because if I fail twice,
I'm gonna shoot myself.

19:10.811 --> 19:12.411
Sorry.

19:13.647 --> 19:15.647
While most of the chefs

19:15.715 --> 19:17.449
are feeling upbeat,
one chef...

19:19.218 --> 19:22.120
Seems to have lost his rhythm.

19:22.187 --> 19:23.621
You all right, bro?

19:23.688 --> 19:26.590
No. I'm getting
like dizzy and .

19:26.658 --> 19:28.425
<i>Relax, bro. Stop and</i>
<i>take a breath, bro, you know?</i>

19:28.493 --> 19:30.993
That's all I'm doing
is breathing.

19:31.061 --> 19:32.261
I don't feel good
at all.

19:32.328 --> 19:34.328
Jason looked like .

19:34.396 --> 19:35.996
So I decided
to go looking for him.

19:36.064 --> 19:37.230
I helped him over
to the medic.

19:37.298 --> 19:38.764
What's going on, man?

19:38.832 --> 19:40.733
He's burning up.
He needs to cool down.

19:40.800 --> 19:42.668
You could tell he's overheated.
Dude's sweating a lot.

19:42.735 --> 19:44.736
Relax. Come sit down.
I'm fine.

19:44.804 --> 19:46.637
He needs--he needs to
take it down a notch.

19:46.705 --> 19:47.938
I just wanna
go cook.

19:48.006 --> 19:49.439
Feel really weak.

19:49.507 --> 19:50.974
How long has this
been going on for?

19:51.041 --> 19:52.576
I've been breathing
like this

19:52.643 --> 19:53.844
like for the past hour.

19:53.912 --> 19:56.048
An hour? Okay.

19:56.116 --> 19:57.883
I'm all right.

19:57.951 --> 19:59.084
You don't really sound
all right.

20:06.305 --> 20:08.039
It's just one hour

20:08.107 --> 20:10.274
before the grand
reopening of Hell's Kitchen.

20:10.342 --> 20:11.975
I'm all right.

20:12.043 --> 20:13.710
You don't really sound
all right.

20:13.778 --> 20:14.944
And it appears as though
the blue team

20:15.012 --> 20:16.279
may be one man down.

20:16.346 --> 20:18.914
Why are my arms
feel, like, weak?

20:18.981 --> 20:20.482
'Cause you're breathing
all crazy.

20:20.550 --> 20:22.150
I'm like, what the hell,

20:22.218 --> 20:24.085
is he having a heart attack
or something?

20:24.153 --> 20:26.719
That wasn't looking
too good for him.

20:26.786 --> 20:28.920
Chino, you're on desserts
right now, bro, all right?

20:28.988 --> 20:31.055
A hundred percent
I care about Jason's well-being,

20:31.123 --> 20:33.024
but regardless, we can't
sit there and harp on it

20:33.091 --> 20:34.692
because we still have
a service to put out.

20:34.760 --> 20:36.060
This is what a kitchen's
about, man.

20:36.128 --> 20:37.028
We gotta pull through,
guys.

20:37.095 --> 20:38.329
I gotcha.
I'm fine.

20:38.396 --> 20:39.696
There you go.

20:41.299 --> 20:42.166
Why don't we take
some of this stuff off you?

20:42.234 --> 20:43.067
It's all wet.

20:45.470 --> 20:47.270
I'm fine.
Hey, please...

20:47.338 --> 20:49.038
I'm sorry, I don't mean
to be like feisty,

20:49.106 --> 20:50.673
but I'm just really
pissed off.

20:57.246 --> 20:59.680
Minutes before service,
Jason is rushed to the hospital,

20:59.747 --> 21:02.218
and Chef Ramsay lets the chefs
in on his status.

21:02.286 --> 21:04.988
All right, listen carefully,
please. Not good news.

21:05.056 --> 21:06.891
Unfortunately, Jason's
been taken to the hospital.

21:06.958 --> 21:08.458
He'll be on a few days
of bed rest.

21:08.526 --> 21:10.460
He will not be returning
back to <i>Hell's Kitchen.</i>

21:10.528 --> 21:12.262
Damn, like, we didn't even
really get out the gates

21:12.330 --> 21:13.796
and then like
we're down a man.

21:13.864 --> 21:15.598
Like how the hell'd
that happen?

21:15.666 --> 21:17.133
I trust the rest of you
are ready to go, yes?

21:17.200 --> 21:18.600
Yes, Chef!

21:18.668 --> 21:20.635
And I'm looking for
a smooth service.

21:20.703 --> 21:22.003
What's it gonna be?
Smooth, Chef!

21:22.071 --> 21:23.138
Let's go.
Yes, Chef!

21:23.205 --> 21:24.972
Jason's gone.

21:25.040 --> 21:26.707
Yeah, it sucks,
because he's a good guy,

21:26.775 --> 21:28.508
but I have no doubt
in my mind

21:28.576 --> 21:29.843
that eight of us guys are better
than nine of those girls.

21:29.911 --> 21:31.644
James.
Yes, Chef?

21:31.712 --> 21:32.712
Open Hell's Kitchen.
Yes, Chef.

21:48.064 --> 21:50.066
Tonight, Hell's Kitchen
is once again

21:50.134 --> 21:51.667
the place to be
in Los Angeles.

21:51.735 --> 21:53.269
The restaurant
has been redesigned

21:53.336 --> 21:55.071
with a stunning balcony
above the kitchen

21:55.138 --> 21:56.772
that gives those diners

21:56.840 --> 21:59.041
a unique view
of the action in the kitchen.

21:59.109 --> 22:00.376
Okay. All right.

22:00.444 --> 22:02.077
First orders, Chef.
Let's go.

22:02.145 --> 22:04.412
Okay, blue team,
here we are.

22:04.480 --> 22:06.314
First ticket,
the blue team.

22:06.381 --> 22:07.715
One risotto, one scallops,
one squab, one spaghetti.

22:07.782 --> 22:09.015
Yes, Chef!

22:09.083 --> 22:09.916
I'm sorry, Chef,
can you repeat that?

22:09.984 --> 22:11.384
Can I repeat that?

22:11.451 --> 22:13.085
I'm sorry, Chef.
Yeah, let me repeat it.

22:13.153 --> 22:15.020
yourself.
Yes, sir.

22:15.088 --> 22:17.088
Can I repeat that.
Is he stupid?

22:17.156 --> 22:20.058
Okay, red team, come here.
Let's go.

22:20.125 --> 22:21.959
First ticket.
Good luck.

22:22.027 --> 22:24.726
Two tables away, table 40, one
scallops, one risotto entree.

22:24.794 --> 22:26.427
<i>One risotto!</i>
<i>One New York--</i>
<i>hey, madame.</i>

22:26.495 --> 22:27.862
I'm not gonna shout
over you.

22:27.930 --> 22:29.530
I've got ten seconds,
a window to call these out.

22:29.598 --> 22:31.631
Come here, you...Big mouth.
Come here.

22:31.699 --> 22:32.965
<i>Call out the ticket.</i>
<i>Come here!</i>

22:33.033 --> 22:34.699
Call out the ticket.

22:34.766 --> 22:36.800
Y'all ready?
We need one scallop,

22:36.868 --> 22:39.435
two risotto for appetizers.

22:39.503 --> 22:42.170
While Elise delivers
the order in the red kitchen...

22:42.238 --> 22:45.072
Thank you.
Over in the blue kitchen...

22:45.139 --> 22:47.039
One chef has made
a delivery of his own.

22:47.107 --> 22:49.874
Monterray,
why are you giving me garnish?

22:49.942 --> 22:51.975
Just got fired a little
bit too early, Chef.

22:52.043 --> 22:53.543
So what does garnish
go with?

22:53.611 --> 22:55.278
Garnish goes
with entrees, Chef.

22:55.345 --> 22:56.779
Right. So then,
are the entrees ready?

22:56.847 --> 22:58.114
<i>No, Chef.</i>

22:58.181 --> 22:59.915
So why did you just
send them on their own?

22:59.983 --> 23:01.449
Uh...

23:01.517 --> 23:02.884
We haven't even sent

23:02.952 --> 23:04.319
the first table
appetizers,

23:04.386 --> 23:05.886
now I've got the
garnish!

23:05.954 --> 23:07.087
My apologies, Chef.
Never again.

23:07.155 --> 23:09.123
off, Monterray.

23:09.191 --> 23:11.091
While Monterray
struggles with his timing...

23:11.159 --> 23:12.759
Come on, guys, get a grip.
Talk to each other.

23:12.827 --> 23:14.361
Back in the red kitchen,

23:14.429 --> 23:16.563
Carrie is ready
with her first appetizer.

23:16.631 --> 23:18.531
We got it?
We're good?

23:18.599 --> 23:20.666
Yeah, let's go.
Scallops going to the pass.

23:20.734 --> 23:23.536
<i>So now we've got scallops</i>
<i>and no risotto.</i>

23:23.603 --> 23:26.238
Where's the risotto?
<i>In my hand, Chef.</i>

23:26.306 --> 23:28.273
My scallops
are up in the pass.

23:28.340 --> 23:30.007
It was extremely frustrating,
because I'm doing my part.

23:30.075 --> 23:31.074
I was just like,
Elise, come on.

23:31.142 --> 23:32.208
Make some risotto.

23:32.276 --> 23:33.711
Walking with a risotto.

23:41.019 --> 23:42.052
Stop!

23:42.120 --> 23:43.554
<i>No chance!</i>

23:43.622 --> 23:45.556
This doesn't even look like
a risotto.

23:45.623 --> 23:47.390
<i>It looks like a rice pudding.</i>
<i>Look at it.</i>

23:47.458 --> 23:48.625
!

23:48.693 --> 23:50.193
You start showing me

23:50.261 --> 23:51.094
you don't care about
my customers...

23:51.161 --> 23:52.061
I do care.

23:52.129 --> 23:53.963
I'm gonna start showing you

23:54.031 --> 23:55.664
<i>that I don't care about you.</i>
Yes, Chef.

23:55.732 --> 23:58.166
Can no one make
a risotto?

23:58.234 --> 23:59.434
I'm on it, Chef.

23:59.501 --> 24:01.169
<i>Krupa's jumping on it, Chef.</i>

24:01.236 --> 24:02.369
Krupa? You're gonna have
Krupa replace me?

24:02.437 --> 24:03.604
I'll kick Krupa's ass

24:03.671 --> 24:05.605
with a blindfold
and a broken arm.

24:05.673 --> 24:07.573
While Krupa fires up
a new risotto...

24:07.641 --> 24:08.874
Fire.

24:08.942 --> 24:10.843
Over in the blue kitchen,

24:10.911 --> 24:13.079
Steven is eager to deliver
his food to Chef Ramsay.

24:13.147 --> 24:15.381
Can I come up with it?
How's the scallop?

24:15.449 --> 24:17.416
<i>Let's go up with it</i>
<i>right now? Can I go?</i>

24:17.484 --> 24:18.817
Go up. Go up with it.
Don't go up with it, man.

24:18.885 --> 24:20.619
<i>Can I go?</i>
<i>I'm ready.</i>

24:20.686 --> 24:23.021
No, no!
Lotsa spaghetti up, guys.

24:24.157 --> 24:25.591
Oh, me.

24:25.659 --> 24:27.793
So the lobster's ready
for the second table,

24:27.861 --> 24:30.194
thanks to Steven.
I just want the first.

24:30.262 --> 24:32.095
I'm working on the first.
So why are you giving me
the second?

24:32.163 --> 24:33.896
I-I'll go one at a time.

24:33.964 --> 24:36.198
The thought of you doing
two things at once--forget it!

24:36.265 --> 24:39.100
Just focus on
the first ticket, Steven.

24:39.168 --> 24:40.401
<i>Yes, Chef.</i>

24:40.468 --> 24:41.735
Talk, bro.

24:41.803 --> 24:43.502
Steven was very easily
flustered,

24:43.570 --> 24:45.170
and I told him it wasn't
time to put it up.

24:45.238 --> 24:47.139
Risotto, scallop,
we can go.

24:47.206 --> 24:49.007
We don't have the time to sit
here and do twice.

24:49.075 --> 24:50.375
Going to the window.
Coming to the side, Chef.

24:50.443 --> 24:51.876
<i>Right behind.</i>
<i>Right behind.</i>

24:51.944 --> 24:54.245
Table 23, please.
Let's go.

24:54.313 --> 24:56.247
Thanks to will,
the blue diners

24:56.315 --> 24:59.483
are finally receiving
their first appetizers.

24:59.551 --> 25:01.585
Mmm! Ooh, that's good.

25:01.652 --> 25:03.219
Thank you!

25:03.287 --> 25:04.853
Meanwhile, back
in the red kitchen, Krupa...

25:04.921 --> 25:06.755
Walking with the risotto!

25:06.823 --> 25:09.057
Has delivered her risotto
for Chef Ramsay's approval.

25:09.125 --> 25:11.758
Who made that risotto?

25:11.826 --> 25:13.193
I did, Chef.

25:13.261 --> 25:14.527
Yeah.
Delicious!

25:14.595 --> 25:15.962
Thank you.
<i>Good job, Krupa.</i>

25:16.029 --> 25:18.263
Uh! Uh!
Krupa's back!

25:18.331 --> 25:19.932
Whoo! Go, team!

25:19.999 --> 25:20.899
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

25:20.967 --> 25:22.201
Sorry.

25:22.268 --> 25:23.969
Make ten more like that,
finish service,

25:24.036 --> 25:25.569
then maybe...
Yes, Chef.

25:25.637 --> 25:27.538
But don't start
peeing your knickers now!

25:27.606 --> 25:29.006
Yes, Chef.

25:29.073 --> 25:30.707
It's an hour
into dinner service,

25:30.775 --> 25:32.475
and with Krupa's help,

25:32.543 --> 25:35.278
food is finally making its way
out to the red diners.

25:35.345 --> 25:37.145
The risotto's really good.

25:37.213 --> 25:39.713
Meanwhile, the blue kitchen
has moved on to entrees.

25:39.780 --> 25:41.047
Blue team!

25:41.115 --> 25:43.082
It's the first table!
Come on!

25:43.149 --> 25:45.783
And Chino is bringing
his fish to the pass.

25:45.851 --> 25:47.285
Hot, hot, hot.

25:47.352 --> 25:49.318
What's he done to this?

25:51.421 --> 25:52.654
Blue team!
Yes, Chef.

25:52.722 --> 25:54.122
No garnish anywhere.

25:54.190 --> 25:55.589
Still fragmented,

25:55.657 --> 25:58.258
and look--it's burnt.

26:03.630 --> 26:04.797
Chino!

26:04.864 --> 26:05.664
<i>Come here, you--</i>

26:09.399 --> 26:12.549
It's 1 1/2 hours into
opening night of Hell's Kitchen.

26:12.554 --> 26:13.721
What are you doing?

26:13.789 --> 26:15.388
I-I don't know.

26:15.456 --> 26:17.858
And one chef may have
just burned his last chance

26:17.926 --> 26:19.658
with Chef Ramsay.

26:19.726 --> 26:21.627
I burned the miso cod.

26:21.694 --> 26:23.295
And I should know ,
too, 'cause I'm Asian.

26:23.363 --> 26:24.696
Oh, guys.

26:24.764 --> 26:26.664
Chino really
the cod up, man.

26:26.732 --> 26:28.733
Basted that
with roof tar or something.

26:28.800 --> 26:31.168
Chino!
Come here, you.
Yes, Chef?

26:31.236 --> 26:32.669
Get outta my sight.

26:32.737 --> 26:34.271
Sit down.

26:34.339 --> 26:35.972
Scott, get him peeling
onions, garlic,

26:36.040 --> 26:37.507
but away from the stove.
There you go.

26:37.574 --> 26:39.408
At least you won't be able
to burn any of that.

26:39.476 --> 26:40.575
Ugh. Horrible.

26:40.643 --> 26:43.444
Absolute useless.

26:43.512 --> 26:45.879
While a benched Chino

26:45.947 --> 26:47.848
watches from the sidelines...

26:47.916 --> 26:49.716
I want all the entrees!

26:49.784 --> 26:51.184
Yes, Chef!

26:51.252 --> 26:52.751
Krupa is ready
to lead her team once again

26:52.819 --> 26:54.386
with their first entrees.

26:54.453 --> 26:56.521
Let's get these entrees out
together.

26:56.589 --> 26:58.790
As girls, we've made a pact--
we are not losing tonight.

26:58.857 --> 27:01.559
<i>Wellington's ready.</i>
<i>I'm walking with it right now.</i>

27:01.626 --> 27:03.027
So it's a little bit
more pressure for me

27:03.094 --> 27:04.394
not to up.

27:06.764 --> 27:08.831
Who cooked the Wellington?

27:11.502 --> 27:12.802
Perfect.

27:12.869 --> 27:14.303
Yes, Chef, thank you.

27:14.370 --> 27:15.637
♪ Thank God ♪

27:15.705 --> 27:17.405
It was perfect.
Let's go, ladies.

27:17.473 --> 27:19.674
Let's kick the boys' ass!
Damn right!

27:19.741 --> 27:21.108
Service,
cor the Wellington, please.

27:21.176 --> 27:22.676
An entree leaving the kitchen.

27:22.744 --> 27:24.178
Finally!
Let's go.

27:24.245 --> 27:27.080
Krupa's leadership
has helped the red team

27:27.148 --> 27:28.615
get entrees out
to their hungry diners.

27:28.682 --> 27:30.283
It's worth the wait.

27:30.350 --> 27:32.150
Meanwhile,
in the blue kitchen...

27:32.218 --> 27:33.218
Scallops are ready
to go?

27:33.286 --> 27:34.919
Almost.

27:34.987 --> 27:37.121
Steven has taken Chino's place
on the fish station.

27:37.188 --> 27:38.956
Fish was sinking
like an anchor.

27:39.023 --> 27:40.890
I said, yo, let me
go help them out.

27:40.958 --> 27:43.360
I know I can cook good.

27:43.428 --> 27:45.329
Scallops--where are they?
Yes!

27:45.396 --> 27:46.530
Let's go, you!

27:47.932 --> 27:50.267
Put the plate down
and work with two hands.

27:50.335 --> 27:53.036
Sorry, Chef.
Hurry up!

27:54.204 --> 27:56.605
Scallops are in the window!

27:59.041 --> 28:01.842
All right,
come here, you.

28:01.909 --> 28:03.676
Just touch.

28:03.744 --> 28:05.711
They're springy, Chef.
They're what?

28:05.779 --> 28:07.679
Springy. When you spring back,
usually they're ready.

28:07.747 --> 28:09.080
So they're ready,
are they?

28:09.148 --> 28:10.582
I feel that
they're ready.

28:10.650 --> 28:12.786
That rubbery.

28:12.853 --> 28:15.155
Sorry, Chef.

28:15.223 --> 28:16.757
Everything Steven
was touching

28:16.824 --> 28:17.657
was turning into
tonight.

28:17.725 --> 28:18.992
Know how they say

28:19.060 --> 28:21.627
you can't teach
an old dog new tricks?

28:21.695 --> 28:23.696
Sit down and eat them.

28:23.763 --> 28:25.464
Enjoy your...
Springy scallops.

28:25.532 --> 28:27.499
Let me know how you feel
halfway through.

28:27.567 --> 28:28.766
<i>Bon appetit.</i>

28:28.834 --> 28:31.535
Oh.
I think they're perfect.

28:31.602 --> 28:33.903
<i>Come on, fellas.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

28:33.971 --> 28:36.004
Chef Ramsay has already
benched two members

28:36.072 --> 28:37.072
of the blue team.

28:37.140 --> 28:38.273
I need two scallops!

28:38.341 --> 28:39.841
!

28:39.909 --> 28:41.542
He is now looking for Tommy

28:41.610 --> 28:43.344
to rescue the fish station.

28:43.411 --> 28:45.412
<i>How's that?</i>

28:45.480 --> 28:48.048
Hey, rock and roll Bozo,
come here.

28:48.115 --> 28:51.217
I go from springy
to boiled bits of .

28:51.285 --> 28:52.652
Ugh!

28:52.720 --> 28:53.653
Yeah, they sucked.

28:55.355 --> 28:57.490
Took a hell of a dive.
Take a seat.

28:57.557 --> 28:59.225
Eat them.
Service, please.

28:59.292 --> 29:01.695
Little glass of wine,
Sauvignon Blanc

29:01.762 --> 29:03.930
goes beautifully well
with the raw ceviche skillet.

29:03.998 --> 29:05.965
Hell's Kitchen
weeds out the weak.

29:06.033 --> 29:07.634
This competition is mine.
It's only a matter of time.

29:07.702 --> 29:09.403
One, two, three of you,

29:09.471 --> 29:11.605
all on the
fish station!

29:11.673 --> 29:13.340
I jumped over
to help out, Chef.

29:13.408 --> 29:14.840
Yeah, I wish you'd
jumped in the oven!

29:14.908 --> 29:17.576
That would make my life
a lot easier.

29:17.644 --> 29:20.846
Nearly two hours
into dinner service,

29:20.913 --> 29:23.748
the blue team has completely
stalled on the fish station.

29:23.815 --> 29:25.249
But over in the red kitchen...

29:25.317 --> 29:27.451
Scallops are going up
to the pass!

29:27.519 --> 29:31.056
Carrie is ready to impress
Chef Ramsay with her scallops.

29:33.259 --> 29:34.759
Carrie,
scallops are overcooked.

29:34.826 --> 29:35.592
The sca--
I want more color.

29:35.660 --> 29:36.693
The pan's got to be hot.

29:36.761 --> 29:39.096
Yes, Chef.

29:39.163 --> 29:40.932
Oh, we're not about to go down
on some scallops.

29:40.999 --> 29:42.132
Come on, please.

29:42.200 --> 29:43.266
The scallops
are coming, Chef.

29:43.334 --> 29:44.701
Let's go.

29:44.769 --> 29:46.469
This early in the game,
you know,

29:46.537 --> 29:48.504
get your together,
keep it moving.

29:48.571 --> 29:51.973
Look, they're boiled.
Rubber and boiled.

29:52.041 --> 29:53.875
This is very,
very frustrating,

29:53.942 --> 29:55.442
'cause I just wanted to just
make Chef Ramsay proud.

29:55.510 --> 29:57.344
Start again.
Yes, Chef.

29:57.412 --> 29:59.679
As the red team comes
to a screeching halt...

29:59.747 --> 30:01.580
Oh, for sake.

30:01.648 --> 30:03.814
No food is leaving either
kitchen.

30:03.882 --> 30:06.349
I'm pretending it's
my Beef Wellington.

30:06.417 --> 30:08.052
And the diners,

30:08.120 --> 30:10.655
not surprisingly,
are getting restless.

30:10.723 --> 30:12.190
We don't need any more wine.
We need food.

30:15.027 --> 30:16.861
Carved duck, lamb,
Wellington. How long?

30:16.928 --> 30:18.195
Five minutes, Chef.

30:18.263 --> 30:19.964
Monterray, can you talk
to me?

30:20.032 --> 30:21.432
Five minutes, Chef. Word.

30:21.500 --> 30:23.066
I want the garnish
30 seconds

30:23.134 --> 30:24.301
<i>before the protein</i>
<i>hit the window.</i>

30:24.369 --> 30:25.802
Got it?
Yes, Chef.

30:25.870 --> 30:28.437
Let's just put up
one table.

30:30.173 --> 30:32.174
Are you serious?

30:32.241 --> 30:33.442
Oh, I can't get
a Pinot Noir?

30:33.509 --> 30:34.409
<i>Are they all out of red?</i>

30:34.477 --> 30:35.977
There's your teamwork there.

30:36.045 --> 30:37.845
<i>Really concerned.</i>

30:37.913 --> 30:40.981
The three stooges.

30:41.049 --> 30:42.983
Got the Wellington
coming up.

30:43.051 --> 30:46.153
Jonathon, look at it.

30:46.220 --> 30:47.821
Sure, Chef.
I apologize.

30:47.888 --> 30:48.988
It's cooked perfectly.

30:49.056 --> 30:50.356
Thank you, Chef.

30:50.423 --> 30:51.590
First one
of the night.

30:51.658 --> 30:52.691
Let's go.
Thank you, Chef.

30:52.759 --> 30:54.393
I have never
in my life

30:54.461 --> 30:57.562
cooked a beef Wellington,
but I've rocked it today

30:57.630 --> 30:59.030
and I'm gonna keep on
rockin' it, man.

30:59.098 --> 31:00.999
I got my Wellington ready.

31:01.066 --> 31:04.101
Monterray, Brendan, I've got
a Wellington cooked perfectly,

31:04.169 --> 31:07.037
but where's
the garnish?

31:07.104 --> 31:08.671
<i>My fault, fellas, my fault.</i>

31:08.739 --> 31:10.272
How long on garnish?
Two minutes.

31:10.340 --> 31:11.740
The protein's
cooked perfectly.

31:11.808 --> 31:13.241
By now it's stone cold.

31:13.309 --> 31:15.209
damn.
Monterray, I got this.

31:15.277 --> 31:17.977
Yeah, you got just a big old bag
of "what the ?"

31:18.045 --> 31:20.279
Here you go.
Take it.

31:20.347 --> 31:21.947
He's not even two minutes
away.

31:22.015 --> 31:24.115
<i>He's miles away.</i>

31:24.183 --> 31:26.016
<i>Get another</i>
<i>Wellington in now!</i>

31:26.084 --> 31:27.751
We cannot lose this dinner
service.

31:27.819 --> 31:30.119
Like, my ass is, like,
seriously on the line.

31:30.187 --> 31:32.087
While the blue team
tries to recover

31:32.155 --> 31:33.922
from Monterray's
mistimed garnish...

31:33.990 --> 31:36.024
Away now, one sea bass,
one chicken, one Wellington.

31:36.092 --> 31:37.359
Yes, Chef.

31:37.427 --> 31:38.893
Back in the red kitchen,

31:38.961 --> 31:39.994
Carrie is looking
to redeem herself

31:40.062 --> 31:41.462
on the fish station.

31:41.530 --> 31:43.030
I'll cook the fish.
I'll cook it.

31:43.098 --> 31:44.865
But Elise has other plans.

31:44.933 --> 31:46.867
I got it, babe. No,
I got it. It's my station.

31:46.935 --> 31:48.602
Don't push me.
Thank you.

31:48.669 --> 31:50.403
Clearly, Carrie
is a weaker cook than I am,

31:50.471 --> 31:51.671
so I felt like I wanted
to take charge

31:51.738 --> 31:53.272
to impress Chef Ramsay.

31:53.340 --> 31:54.607
Why is she cooking fish?

31:54.674 --> 31:56.308
I don't know
what she's doing.

31:56.376 --> 31:57.743
She just came over here
and grabbed it, Chef.

31:57.810 --> 31:59.044
I mean, are you
kidding me?

31:59.111 --> 32:00.545
That bitch is just crazy.

32:00.613 --> 32:01.946
What in the
Is she doing?

32:02.014 --> 32:03.615
I didn't let her cook it.

32:03.682 --> 32:04.849
She came over here
and grabbed it, Chef.

32:04.917 --> 32:05.851
Well, I was gonna
cook it for you

32:05.918 --> 32:06.518
because we're all
a team, right?

32:06.586 --> 32:08.086
Oh!

32:08.154 --> 32:09.421
She's trying
to prove a point.

32:09.489 --> 32:10.755
Elise!
Yes, Chef.

32:10.823 --> 32:12.957
I've got a six top dying
for the appetizers,

32:13.025 --> 32:14.225
and you're cooking fish!

32:14.293 --> 32:15.926
I'll put the spaghetti up.

32:15.994 --> 32:18.562
You, off.
Sit on the chef's table.

32:19.730 --> 32:20.597
Ha!

32:22.466 --> 32:24.934
While Elise spends time
in the penalty box,

32:25.002 --> 32:26.569
back on the blue side...

32:26.636 --> 32:27.403
<i>Jonathon, where are we?</i>

32:27.471 --> 32:28.604
Wellington coming up!

32:28.672 --> 32:30.339
Jonathon has delivered

32:30.407 --> 32:30.773
another perfectly-cooked
Wellington.

32:30.841 --> 32:32.474
Good.

32:32.541 --> 32:35.677
All it needs now is the garnish
from Brendan.

32:35.744 --> 32:37.245
<i>Filet is already up, bro.</i>

32:37.313 --> 32:38.413
Watch the potatoes.
They're about to burn.

32:38.480 --> 32:39.780
Got 'em.
<i>Pull 'em off!</i>

32:39.848 --> 32:41.281
We're waiting on the sides.

32:41.349 --> 32:42.582
Got 'em.

32:43.851 --> 32:45.418
<i>Brendan, look at me.</i>

32:45.485 --> 32:46.552
The potatoes in front of you,
they're burnt.

32:46.620 --> 32:49.187
You're standing over them.

32:49.255 --> 32:50.955
Yes, Chef.

32:51.023 --> 32:52.957
Brendan wanted to sit there
and puff out his chest.

32:53.025 --> 32:54.024
"I know how to
do this.

32:54.092 --> 32:55.326
I'm the man."

32:55.393 --> 32:56.026
you, bro.
You suck.

32:56.094 --> 32:57.927
Come on, guys!

32:57.995 --> 33:00.795
<i>That's twice in a row</i>
<i>cooked to perfection</i>

33:00.863 --> 33:02.663
and we can't even send
a table together

33:02.731 --> 33:04.165
because nobody's together.

33:04.233 --> 33:06.033
Smooth service, my ass!

33:06.101 --> 33:08.168
I have never
in my whole career

33:08.236 --> 33:10.903
ever been stopped by
side items.

33:10.971 --> 33:12.104
<i>Never.</i>

33:12.172 --> 33:14.273
The Wellingtons
were coming out amazing

33:14.341 --> 33:16.308
and I was getting held up
by potatoes? Come on!

33:16.376 --> 33:19.710
Do you have any idea how
frustrating that is?

33:19.778 --> 33:21.912
Paul thinks he's a bad-ass
on the grill.

33:21.979 --> 33:23.079
Don't you talk to me,
dumpling.

33:25.148 --> 33:27.349
With no food coming
out of either kitchen,

33:27.417 --> 33:29.184
James has spotted
a disturbing trend

33:29.252 --> 33:30.318
in the dining room.

33:30.386 --> 33:31.686
Chef.
James.

33:31.754 --> 33:33.888
Tables are walking out.

33:33.956 --> 33:37.191
Blue team,
they're walking out.

33:37.258 --> 33:39.025
You, Muppets,
get off your fat ass.

33:39.093 --> 33:40.727
Let me show you something.

33:40.794 --> 33:44.063
Not one entree has left
this kitchen.

33:44.131 --> 33:45.765
Not one.

33:45.832 --> 33:47.099
Yes, Chef.

33:47.167 --> 33:50.069
And look at the pans
back there!

33:50.136 --> 33:51.870
Any bright ideas?

33:51.938 --> 33:53.505
Want me to jump in?
I'll clean 'em.

33:53.572 --> 33:55.206
I'm talking about
the customers,

33:55.274 --> 33:56.507
not the pans!

33:56.574 --> 33:58.375
Yes, Chef.

33:58.443 --> 33:59.976
Any ideas?
No.

34:00.044 --> 34:01.979
Eh? What are we
gonna do now?

34:02.047 --> 34:05.683
They are walking out!

34:05.751 --> 34:07.451
off!

34:10.072 --> 34:12.306
Nearly three hours
into service,

34:12.373 --> 34:14.007
the grand reopening
of Hell's Kitchen...

34:14.076 --> 34:17.177
They are walking out!

34:17.245 --> 34:20.580
Has become a disaster
of grand proportions.

34:20.647 --> 34:22.947
off!

34:23.016 --> 34:24.916
At that point, it was
a train wreck on ice.

34:24.984 --> 34:25.784
There was nothing
we could do about it.

34:25.851 --> 34:28.052
Stop.

34:28.120 --> 34:29.186
You're out of your misery.

34:34.492 --> 34:35.993
Let's do this, ladies.
Come on.

34:36.061 --> 34:36.827
Let's not disappoint
the customers.

34:36.893 --> 34:40.460
Carrie, they've gone!

34:40.529 --> 34:41.829
Shut it down.

34:41.897 --> 34:43.231
!

34:48.937 --> 34:53.773
This, for me, has been the most
disappointing opening ever.

34:56.409 --> 34:58.945
Carrie, it wasn't the scallops
I was concerned about.

34:59.013 --> 35:01.114
It was about that nothing else
was timed with it.

35:01.182 --> 35:02.982
Well, the risotto kept coming
back.

35:03.050 --> 35:04.784
What was I supposed to do
about that?

35:04.852 --> 35:05.885
Don't try to throw me
under the bus

35:05.953 --> 35:06.953
about the risotto.

35:08.622 --> 35:09.955
Your scallops
came back more than once.

35:10.023 --> 35:11.690
Your scallops came back
more than twice

35:11.758 --> 35:13.724
and I offered to help you
on the fish station

35:13.792 --> 35:16.294
because you can't cook fish.

35:18.196 --> 35:19.929
<i>Paul, Jonathon,</i>

35:19.997 --> 35:22.131
you were sort of standing there
with your pants down,

35:22.199 --> 35:24.799
<i>getting absolutely </i>
<i>every second.</i>

35:24.867 --> 35:25.800
How do you feel?

35:25.868 --> 35:27.368
. Irate.

35:27.436 --> 35:29.803
I sent up the same
four times

35:29.871 --> 35:31.905
and I waited for potatoes
and carrots.

35:31.973 --> 35:34.507
Brendan, are you not bothered
or is it just--?

35:34.575 --> 35:36.876
I am bothered, Chef,
but, uh, we'll try

35:36.944 --> 35:38.478
not to let 'em down
next time, Chef.

35:38.546 --> 35:40.080
Wow.

35:40.147 --> 35:41.881
And I'm really happy
for Paul

35:41.949 --> 35:43.249
that he actually learned how
to cook proteins.

35:43.317 --> 35:44.450
You want to pull 'em out
right now, man?

35:44.518 --> 35:45.818
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>that what you want?</i>

35:46.520 --> 35:47.653
<i>I mean, honestly.</i>

35:47.721 --> 35:49.155
I mean, I'm just calling it
as I see it.

35:49.222 --> 35:50.589
<i>I'm just saying.</i>

35:50.657 --> 35:52.325
The losing team tonight

35:52.393 --> 35:56.362
<i>with zero entrees</i>
<i>leaving the kitchen</i>

35:56.430 --> 35:59.965
is the blue team.

36:00.033 --> 36:01.566
Get back upstairs
to the dorm,

36:01.634 --> 36:05.070
work as a team,
and come to a consensus

36:05.137 --> 36:08.106
on which two are up
for elimination.

36:14.545 --> 36:16.345
Brendan don't know his ass
from his elbow,

36:16.413 --> 36:17.446
but let me
tell you something.

36:17.513 --> 36:18.580
In baseball,
this was a

36:18.648 --> 36:20.516
swing and a miss,
strike three.

36:20.584 --> 36:21.817
Then you hit yourself
in the with the bat.

36:25.019 --> 36:26.419
Anybody want to speak?

36:26.486 --> 36:28.385
Pauly, dude,
it's all you, man.

36:28.453 --> 36:29.885
First of all, you ever pull
that on me again,

36:29.953 --> 36:31.652
I will slap you across
the .

36:31.720 --> 36:33.320
Shut up, dumpling.

36:33.388 --> 36:35.255
I'll say whatever
the I want, all right?

36:35.322 --> 36:37.190
Whatever the
I want, meatball, all right?

36:37.258 --> 36:39.424
Don't ever act like
a tough guy again.

36:39.492 --> 36:41.626
Tough guy?
You had the --

36:43.929 --> 36:45.462
All right,
all right, all right.

36:45.530 --> 36:47.698
breadcrumb,
dumpling ass.

36:47.765 --> 36:48.999
Really, this guy
is a meatball.

36:49.067 --> 36:50.200
He got real lucky tonight.

36:50.268 --> 36:51.535
You're irate.

36:51.603 --> 36:54.471
I am irate!

36:54.539 --> 36:57.772
I'll say this--obviously,
Paul and Jonathon,

36:57.840 --> 36:59.507
those two sat there,
they banged, bro.

36:59.575 --> 37:01.175
I think we should take it--

37:01.243 --> 37:02.509
I think we should take it
to a vote.

37:02.577 --> 37:03.777
<i>I'ma call it out, man.</i>

37:03.845 --> 37:05.712
Sorry, bro.
No offense.

37:05.780 --> 37:07.513
<i>I'm gonna call Steven</i>
<i>as number one.</i>

37:07.581 --> 37:09.414
No, no, no, listen.
I'm a team player.

37:09.482 --> 37:10.982
We don't get that.
We don't.

37:11.050 --> 37:12.549
You didn't even get
entrees out.

37:12.617 --> 37:13.917
Chino was burning fish
left and right.

37:13.985 --> 37:15.853
At least I fed
some people apps.

37:15.920 --> 37:19.457
Did they feed any entrees?
No. Big zero.

37:19.525 --> 37:21.961
Look, sorry, I'm gonna go
with Brendan and Chino

37:22.028 --> 37:25.564
just because nothing
on that side got up.

37:25.631 --> 37:27.132
This sucks, dude.

37:27.200 --> 37:28.600
It's what we signed up for,
guys.

37:28.668 --> 37:30.535
Mm-hmm.

37:30.603 --> 37:32.036
<i>Somebody's gonna</i>
<i>go home, bro.</i>

37:46.049 --> 37:47.449
Men, have you reached
a consensus?

37:47.517 --> 37:49.017
Yes, Chef.

37:49.085 --> 37:52.553
Jonathon, who was
the first nomination?

37:52.621 --> 37:59.592
The blue team's first
nomination was Steve.

37:59.660 --> 38:01.027
Why?

38:01.094 --> 38:04.296
Just the, uh, the different
methods he used and failed.

38:04.364 --> 38:06.765
The blue team's
second nominee.

38:06.833 --> 38:10.534
Well, Monterray actually
was second.

38:10.602 --> 38:11.535
Why, please?

38:11.603 --> 38:12.936
<i>I've never had sides</i>

38:13.004 --> 38:14.771
<i>stop an entree</i>
<i>from going out,</i>

38:14.839 --> 38:17.207
and it was really--it was
really up, you know?

38:17.274 --> 38:19.308
It pissed me off a good bit.

38:19.376 --> 38:22.545
Yeah?
Worthy nominees.

38:22.612 --> 38:27.316
But truthfully, I think
there are three individuals

38:27.384 --> 38:31.018
deserving to step forward
this evening.

38:31.086 --> 38:33.853
Steven, Monterray,
and...

38:45.045 --> 38:47.611
The blue team has nominated
Steve and Monterray

38:47.679 --> 38:50.146
for elimination,
but Chef Ramsay wants to add

38:50.214 --> 38:51.847
a nominee of his own.

38:51.915 --> 38:53.882
I think there are
three individuals

38:53.950 --> 38:57.418
deserving to step forward.

38:57.486 --> 39:03.656
Steven, Monterray,
and...

39:03.724 --> 39:05.658
Chino.

39:05.726 --> 39:07.059
The three of you,
step forward, please.

39:07.127 --> 39:07.960
<i>Let's go.</i>

39:12.265 --> 39:14.165
Monterray.
Yes, Chef.

39:14.233 --> 39:16.367
Why do you think you should
stay in Hell's Kitchen?

39:16.435 --> 39:17.668
I think I should stay
in Hell's Kitchen, Chef,

39:17.736 --> 39:20.103
because I know I can
do better than Steven.

39:20.171 --> 39:21.471
Steven?
<i>Yes, Chef.</i>

39:21.539 --> 39:22.805
Why Steven?

39:22.873 --> 39:24.573
He tried to
step up to the plate

39:24.641 --> 39:25.874
<i>and he really didn't do</i>

39:25.942 --> 39:27.776
what he said
he was gonna do.

39:27.844 --> 39:29.744
Neither did you.

39:29.812 --> 39:31.112
Yes, Chef, I know.

39:31.180 --> 39:32.513
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>at the end of the day,</i>

39:32.581 --> 39:34.048
I was still in there,
fighting.

39:34.115 --> 39:35.915
You know, I tried to
give it my all.

39:35.983 --> 39:37.116
No matter how bad
I started off,

39:37.184 --> 39:39.284
I kept fighting.

39:39.352 --> 39:41.621
Chino, it just
wasn't the garnish

39:41.689 --> 39:42.756
that stopped the entrees
coming out.

39:42.823 --> 39:44.057
Yes, Chef.

39:44.124 --> 39:46.326
You had a pivotal position
on the fish.

39:46.393 --> 39:48.127
It's certainly unacceptable.

39:48.194 --> 39:50.529
I thought I could do it
until the miso cod,

39:50.597 --> 39:52.865
and, uh, I definitely
overextended myself

39:52.933 --> 39:54.733
and I should have said
something but I didn't.

39:54.801 --> 39:57.036
You spent more time
prepping garlic

39:57.103 --> 39:59.604
<i>than you actually did</i>
<i>physically cooking.</i>

39:59.672 --> 40:01.272
I'm looking for
an executive chef.

40:01.339 --> 40:04.374
I'm not looking for
a prep cook.

40:04.442 --> 40:07.076
So, Steven,
you saw what went on.

40:07.144 --> 40:08.777
Yes, Chef.

40:08.845 --> 40:12.547
Who do you think out of all
three of you should be leaving?

40:12.614 --> 40:15.916
Well, I already chose,
uh, Monterray.

40:15.984 --> 40:20.787
Chino and I, we did get
a few appetizers out.

40:20.855 --> 40:23.623
Right now, I'm having
a difficult time.

40:23.691 --> 40:26.492
Honestly,
all three of you sucked.

40:26.560 --> 40:30.029
My decision is...

40:36.334 --> 40:40.170
Chino and Monterray.

40:40.238 --> 40:45.574
That's right, both of you,
back in line.

40:48.609 --> 40:51.444
Steven, jacket off.
Your time is done.

40:51.511 --> 40:54.212
Short and sweet.
Thank you.

40:54.280 --> 40:58.149
Sorry, but I can't
go through that again.

41:03.821 --> 41:07.089
It's embarrassing being
the first one kicked off.

41:07.157 --> 41:09.425
I think that, uh, Chef Ramsay
made a mistake,

41:09.492 --> 41:10.759
but it is what it is.

41:10.827 --> 41:12.160
It's done.

41:12.228 --> 41:13.928
You know, nice guys
always finish last.

41:13.996 --> 41:15.296
That's probably me.

41:19.133 --> 41:22.802
Hell's Kitchen is
a series of tests,

41:22.870 --> 41:29.442
<i>and so far, we have</i>
<i>achieved a failing grade.</i>

41:29.509 --> 41:33.945
Get a grip. Fast.
Got it?

41:34.013 --> 41:35.547
Yes, Chef.

41:35.614 --> 41:37.749
off.

41:37.817 --> 41:39.817
Chef Ramsay gave me
another chance,

41:39.885 --> 41:41.786
so I gotta bring
my a-plus-plus-plus game.

41:41.853 --> 41:43.353
I'ma keep fighting.

41:43.421 --> 41:44.988
I ain't hear no bell.
I gotta bring it.

41:45.056 --> 41:46.890
And I'm so glad
that I know

41:46.958 --> 41:49.325
that I am capable and that
I pulled it off today.

41:49.393 --> 41:51.360
From this point on,
I'm just gonna get better

41:51.428 --> 41:53.762
and better and better
and better.

41:53.830 --> 41:55.965
Now it's time for me and Paul
to go to the mattresses.

41:56.032 --> 41:57.900
It's somebody I'm gonna
have to keep my eye on,

41:57.967 --> 41:59.368
and it's somebody that
I'm gonna have to eliminate

41:59.435 --> 42:00.969
sooner rather than later.

42:01.037 --> 42:03.438
me.

42:03.505 --> 42:05.372
I realized early on that Steven
had as much chance

42:05.440 --> 42:07.307
of being the head chef
of BLT Steak

42:07.375 --> 42:10.309
as I do of winning a gold medal
in figure skating.

42:10.334 --> 42:14.334
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

42:15.446 --> 42:17.513
Next time on <i>Hell's Kitchen...</i>

42:17.581 --> 42:18.781
Let's go!

42:18.849 --> 42:19.815
A rude awakening...

42:19.883 --> 42:21.283
What the ?

42:21.351 --> 42:23.317
Is followed by a feud
on the red team.
