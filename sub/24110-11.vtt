00:02.132 --> 00:04.395
Previously onInstinct:I want to go see a friend

00:04.439 --> 00:06.615
who may be able to help.Wait. I'll drive.

00:06.658 --> 00:07.703
He works undercover.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.314
DYLAN:
I'll take whatever

00:10.358 --> 00:11.620
you can get on the victims.

00:11.663 --> 00:13.056
Who are you?

00:13.100 --> 00:14.231
Where did you find out all this?

00:14.275 --> 00:15.406
Does it matter?
Of...

00:15.450 --> 00:16.886
It matters if I want
to get a warrant

00:16.929 --> 00:18.061
to back up these rumors.

00:18.105 --> 00:19.758
You know things you're
not telling me,

00:19.802 --> 00:21.586
but these are my cases.

00:23.197 --> 00:25.199
â™ª

00:46.698 --> 00:49.092
[people screaming,
frantic chatter]

00:56.230 --> 00:58.232
â™ª

01:04.368 --> 01:06.631
WOMAN:
New York's Finest!

01:06.675 --> 01:10.635
Joan has told me everything
about you.

01:10.679 --> 01:13.029
: And about
your hush-hush past.

01:13.073 --> 01:16.511
Can the government really
create hurricanes?

01:16.554 --> 01:18.252
Uh, no.

01:18.295 --> 01:19.601
But if I was
going to share

01:19.644 --> 01:21.081
an intelligence
secret with you,

01:21.124 --> 01:23.605
I would totally do it
in a pancake restaurant.

01:23.648 --> 01:26.086
Oh, the sourdough pancakes here
are amazing.

01:26.129 --> 01:27.565
Do you want a drink?

01:27.609 --> 01:30.220
No, thanks.Dylan, I think...

01:30.264 --> 01:32.004
I can help you.

01:32.048 --> 01:33.441
I hope Joan explained,
my reservations

01:33.484 --> 01:35.356
have nothing to do
with you personally.

01:35.399 --> 01:37.880
And yes, I was talked
into doing that

01:37.923 --> 01:39.403
local TV
news segment...

01:39.447 --> 01:41.971
Mistake, small potatoes.
It devalues your brand.

01:42.014 --> 01:44.582
I do not have a brand.
I do not want a brand.

01:44.626 --> 01:47.237
And no offense--
I do not need a publicist.

01:47.281 --> 01:48.760
I disagree.

01:48.804 --> 01:50.806
Now, listen up,
because this is

01:50.849 --> 01:53.243
not-screwing-around Ashley
you're talking to now.

01:53.287 --> 01:54.636
Bring it in.

01:54.679 --> 01:55.854
Come on.

01:55.898 --> 01:57.117
A little closer.

01:57.160 --> 01:58.553
Right here, right here.

01:58.596 --> 02:00.468
Stop.

02:00.511 --> 02:02.557
:
You do not need a publicist.

02:03.775 --> 02:06.778
You need the best publicist.

02:06.822 --> 02:09.259
I am talking about me.Yes, got that.

02:09.303 --> 02:12.654
But my life
does not need publicizing.

02:12.697 --> 02:15.787
Look, the public deserves
to hear about their heroes.

02:15.831 --> 02:17.659
That is why I have arranged

02:17.702 --> 02:20.183
for New Yorkmagazine
to do a story about you.

02:20.227 --> 02:22.316
Well, that's
very impressive, but...

02:22.359 --> 02:24.666
Did I mention you'll be
on the cover?

02:24.709 --> 02:26.842
Now do you want
that drink?

02:26.885 --> 02:28.235
Still no.

02:28.278 --> 02:31.412
But I do have an idea
about that magazine story.

02:32.717 --> 02:34.676
Bring it in.

02:35.503 --> 02:37.026
JASMINE:
I created a monster.

02:37.069 --> 02:38.810
Now she's weighing in
on the venue.

02:38.854 --> 02:40.986
Oh, that has to stop.
This is your wedding.

02:41.030 --> 02:43.206
You know my mom--
she needs to be the star.

02:43.250 --> 02:45.208
She needs to be the star,
the costar, the understudy

02:45.252 --> 02:47.254
and the guy in the lobby
who sells Milk Duds.

02:47.297 --> 02:48.603
You should just
keep her busy.

02:48.646 --> 02:49.560
Give her
something to do.

02:49.604 --> 02:50.822
Lizzie, you may have just

02:50.866 --> 02:52.650
come up with a way
to save my insanity

02:52.694 --> 02:53.999
that doesn't
include vodka.

02:54.043 --> 02:55.305
It's my pleasure,

02:55.349 --> 02:56.698
and you owe me one.

02:56.741 --> 02:58.569
And I'm paying up right now.

02:58.613 --> 03:01.093
I'm putting you
on the grade list.

03:01.137 --> 03:02.486
What?

03:02.530 --> 03:03.574
I'm recommending you
for a promotion.

03:03.618 --> 03:05.707
To second grade detective?

03:05.750 --> 03:08.710
No, to flight engineer
on the space station.

03:08.753 --> 03:10.668
Yes, to second grade detective.

03:10.712 --> 03:12.496
You've closed some
big cases lately.

03:12.540 --> 03:14.106
Dylan shares in that.

03:14.150 --> 03:17.284
Yeah, yeah, he's a genius,
but you are my best cop.

03:17.327 --> 03:19.416
And it's not a favor.
You deserve it.

03:19.460 --> 03:21.723
Thank you, but I'm not gonna
celebrate just yet.

03:21.766 --> 03:23.507
I could be stuck on that
grade list for years.

03:23.551 --> 03:25.727
No, your name's already
on the chief's desk.

03:25.770 --> 03:27.337
This is in the works.

03:27.381 --> 03:28.599
Wow.

03:28.643 --> 03:30.297
It does mean
more responsibility.

03:30.340 --> 03:32.124
I know. That's why
I'm so excited.

03:33.561 --> 03:35.563
Oh.

03:37.956 --> 03:39.784
Lieutenant Gooden.

03:42.657 --> 03:44.485
Any fatalities?

03:45.616 --> 03:48.140
Okay, we're on our way.

03:48.184 --> 03:50.621
Suicide bomber just blew
himself up in Battery Park.

03:50.665 --> 03:52.406
You should get over there.

03:52.449 --> 03:53.842
Dylan asked to be assigned.

03:53.885 --> 03:55.844
Okay.

04:04.679 --> 04:06.420
Hey.
Hey.

04:06.463 --> 04:08.639
The bomb squad's nearly
finished its sweep.

04:08.683 --> 04:10.946
LIZZIE: You asked
to be assigned this case?

04:10.989 --> 04:12.774
No, I just called to
offer my expertise.

04:12.817 --> 04:15.298
Back in the day, my
study on suicide bombers

04:15.342 --> 04:18.301
kind of made me a name in the
abnormal behavior community.

04:18.345 --> 04:20.172
Hmm. Sounds like a fun bunch.

04:20.216 --> 04:23.045
By the way, is there a subject
you're not an expert on?

04:23.088 --> 04:24.699
Whale hunting?
Soap carving?

04:24.742 --> 04:26.048
As a matter of fact,
soap carving

04:26.091 --> 04:27.310
became popular
in 1924...

04:27.354 --> 04:28.790
All clear.Thank God.

04:28.833 --> 04:30.531
Okay.

04:30.574 --> 04:33.490
Wallet and I.D.

04:33.534 --> 04:35.579
DYLAN:
Guess he wanted credit.

04:35.623 --> 04:37.973
Ramzy Kharal, 25.

04:38.016 --> 04:39.453
I'll call the
Intelligence Bureau,

04:39.496 --> 04:41.193
see if he's on
their radar.

04:43.892 --> 04:46.503
Name and appearance suggests
Middle Eastern descent,

04:46.547 --> 04:48.766
but look at his face--
clean-shaven.

04:48.810 --> 04:51.160
Don't bombers shave
in order to blend in?

04:51.203 --> 04:52.161
Yes,

04:52.204 --> 04:53.641
but most Middle Eastern bombers

04:53.684 --> 04:55.730
have beards their entire lives,
so when they shave,

04:55.773 --> 04:57.340
the lower part
of their faces is lighter

04:57.384 --> 04:58.776
from being deprived
of the sun.

04:58.820 --> 05:01.562
The color of Ramzy's skin
is uniform.

05:01.605 --> 05:04.086
That doesn't fit the profile
of a suicide bomber.

05:04.129 --> 05:06.349
Neither does the fact
he was the only one killed.

05:06.393 --> 05:07.959
Malfunction?
Change of heart?

05:08.003 --> 05:11.963
Hard to say, but even an attack
with limited casualties

05:12.007 --> 05:15.271
can cause a devastating
psychological effect on a city.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.578
Did we find
the detonator he used?Blown to bits,

05:17.621 --> 05:21.059
so it's gonna take a while
to get any info.

05:21.103 --> 05:23.975
He lives a few blocks away.
Hey, guys, don't leave.

05:24.019 --> 05:25.716
We're gonna need a
sweep of his apartment.

05:29.894 --> 05:31.896
LIZZIE:
Okay.

05:31.940 --> 05:34.377
Wow.

05:34.421 --> 05:36.074
Judging by all these materials,

05:36.118 --> 05:38.642
I would say Ramzy
was a ringleader

05:38.686 --> 05:40.035
or a member of a cell,

05:40.078 --> 05:42.690
because one suicide bomber
would not need all this.

05:42.733 --> 05:45.780
Our bomber was a graduate
student at Columbia University.

05:45.823 --> 05:48.391
Got his visa from the
American University in Cairo.

05:48.435 --> 05:51.133
I studied Arabic there.

05:51.176 --> 05:52.830
I really need to travel more.

05:52.874 --> 05:54.528
I've never been east
of Flushing.

05:55.833 --> 05:57.487
So you think this
is the beginning

05:57.531 --> 06:00.011
of a wave
of these attacks?

06:00.055 --> 06:01.578
Hey, come here. Quick.

06:04.494 --> 06:06.888
Today's date is circled, and
there are two sets of numbers.

06:06.931 --> 06:08.237
What time did the bomb go off?

06:08.280 --> 06:10.413
1:14.
1314.

06:10.457 --> 06:12.633
Military time for 1:14 p.m.

06:12.676 --> 06:15.592
What about the other
four numbers? 1071.

06:15.636 --> 06:17.986
Since we have date and time,
I'm guessing it's location,

06:18.029 --> 06:19.640
but that's not enough digits
for GPS coordinates.

06:19.683 --> 06:21.032
Unless we assume
they're local.

06:21.076 --> 06:22.599
Can we pinpoint a location

06:22.643 --> 06:24.035
within the city
using those

06:24.079 --> 06:26.124
last four numbers
as a suffix?

06:27.212 --> 06:28.866
Oh, my God.

06:28.910 --> 06:29.911
They're coordinated
for Battery Park,

06:29.954 --> 06:31.391
right where
the bomb went off.

06:31.434 --> 06:32.827
There's gonna be
another attack today.

06:32.870 --> 06:34.394
Yeah, at 1621-- 4:21.

06:34.437 --> 06:35.917
That's in 15 minutes.

06:35.960 --> 06:37.353
Where's 4360?

06:37.397 --> 06:40.487
The band shell in Central park.

06:40.530 --> 06:42.489
If we find our guy,
we isolate and contain

06:42.532 --> 06:44.578
until the bomb
squad gets here.

06:46.318 --> 06:48.233
DYLAN:
Guy's slouching. Too relaxed.

06:48.277 --> 06:51.062
Gait's too loose, steady.The blonde woman
with a case?

06:51.106 --> 06:53.891
DYLAN: No, normal response
to her environment.

06:59.331 --> 07:01.638
3:00-- walking too fast,
hunched over.

07:03.335 --> 07:05.903
Police! Don't move!But I didn't do anything.

07:05.947 --> 07:07.731
Now, listen to me.
We are going to stand

07:07.775 --> 07:09.037
in this position until
the bomb squad arrives.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.517
You understand

07:12.954 --> 07:14.651
Are you okay?Yes, sir.

07:14.695 --> 07:16.305
DYLAN: You all right?LIZZIE: Oh, my God.

07:16.348 --> 07:17.524
It's the woman
we ruled out.

07:17.567 --> 07:19.700
The woman Iruled out.

07:19.743 --> 07:21.528
What did I miss?

07:23.530 --> 07:25.575
â™ª

07:34.976 --> 07:36.760
REPORTER: Police are scanning
the area for more...

07:37.892 --> 07:40.982
Thank you.

07:41.025 --> 07:42.897
Her name is Barbara Kramer.

07:42.940 --> 07:44.202
She lived in Fort Washington.

07:44.246 --> 07:46.074
How did I miss
her tells?

07:46.117 --> 07:47.031
She was behaving normally.

07:47.075 --> 07:48.990
She stooped
to help that child.

07:49.033 --> 07:51.471
It's as though she switched
off her body's own reactions.

07:51.514 --> 07:53.124
Bombers sometimes
appear drugged.

07:53.168 --> 07:54.517
They sweat.
They have tunnel vision.

07:54.561 --> 07:57.651
She displayed none
of that. None.

07:57.694 --> 07:59.043
We were supposed
to have lunch together,

07:59.087 --> 08:00.610
but she canceled.

08:00.654 --> 08:02.046
Do you know why?

08:02.090 --> 08:05.223
No, I have no idea.

08:05.267 --> 08:06.964
I can't believe she's dead,
and...

08:07.008 --> 08:08.313
in this awful way.

08:08.357 --> 08:10.228
Any recent changes
in her behavior?

08:10.272 --> 08:13.057
She was upset about politics.

08:13.101 --> 08:15.016
She was ranting more,
but who hasn't been?

08:15.059 --> 08:16.757
Was she under any stress?

08:16.800 --> 08:19.107
Uh, her cheating husband
left her a year ago,

08:19.150 --> 08:22.545
and she began worrying
that her playing was suffering.

08:22.589 --> 08:23.981
Was she seeing anyone new?

08:24.025 --> 08:26.114
You know, she hinted at it.

08:26.157 --> 08:29.247
And she was rushing off a lot
after rehearsals, but...

08:29.291 --> 08:30.727
she could be secretive.

08:30.771 --> 08:32.816
She mostly kept to herself.

08:32.860 --> 08:35.166
Did she ever mention
a Ramzy Kharal?

08:36.646 --> 08:38.866
Sorry.
No, that doesn't ring a bell.

08:38.909 --> 08:41.608
LIZZIE: Did your brother ever
mention dating Barbara Kramer?

08:41.651 --> 08:43.131
Barbara Kramer?

08:43.174 --> 08:44.959
No, it doesn't ring a bell.

08:45.002 --> 08:47.614
Ramzy never
mentioned her name?

08:47.657 --> 08:50.965
But if my brother
were romantically involved,

08:51.008 --> 08:52.967
he probably wouldn't
have told me.

08:53.010 --> 08:56.448
I... I ask too many questions.

08:57.667 --> 08:59.495
Since your brother arrived here,

08:59.539 --> 09:01.149
have you had any cause
for concern

09:01.192 --> 09:02.846
about his friends or interests?

09:02.890 --> 09:04.239
None.

09:04.282 --> 09:06.458
He did start driving
for a rideshare company.

09:06.502 --> 09:09.070
I can get you the name.Please.

09:09.113 --> 09:11.986
And I worried about
all the strangers he drove.

09:12.029 --> 09:13.248
But...

09:13.291 --> 09:14.771
he said it's
so expensive here,

09:14.815 --> 09:16.730
and he didn't want
to call home for more money.

09:16.773 --> 09:19.341
He felt my parents
had done enough.

09:19.384 --> 09:21.561
They were so proud of him.

09:22.692 --> 09:24.607
Have you spoken to them?

09:24.651 --> 09:28.872
Yes, they're on the first flight
out of Cairo.

09:28.916 --> 09:32.354
My parents are such good,
decent people.

09:32.397 --> 09:34.835
They don't deserve this.

09:42.973 --> 09:44.845
Don't do the
magazine story.

09:44.888 --> 09:45.976
Wow.

09:46.020 --> 09:48.239
Your contacts
in the publishing world

09:48.283 --> 09:50.459
didn't take long
to get on the phone.

09:50.502 --> 09:51.678
I appreciate your concern,

09:51.721 --> 09:52.940
but you're worrying
about nothing.

09:52.983 --> 09:54.724
Kandahar, Fallujah, Waziristan.

09:54.768 --> 09:56.726
We've seen a lot together.

09:56.770 --> 09:58.772
You used to be careful.

09:58.815 --> 10:02.558
Are you comparing Pakistan's
lawless border region

10:02.602 --> 10:03.994
with a magazine
that did a cover story

10:04.038 --> 10:05.779
about the city's best falafel?

10:05.822 --> 10:10.087
I'm saying former CIA officers
don't hire publicists.

10:10.131 --> 10:12.437
You been spying on me?
Yes.

10:13.482 --> 10:15.092
She's not my publicist.

10:15.136 --> 10:16.703
Two words:

10:16.746 --> 10:18.400
Tony Collins.

10:18.443 --> 10:20.358
Five words:

10:20.402 --> 10:22.230
I have work to do.

10:26.147 --> 10:28.279
Collins was careless.

10:33.589 --> 10:35.025
Anything at
our musician's apartment?

10:35.069 --> 10:37.027
No maps, no explosives,
no nothing.

10:37.071 --> 10:39.377
We ran a check on Ramzy's
sister: squeaky clean.

10:39.421 --> 10:41.162
Any contact at all
between the bombers?

10:41.205 --> 10:42.642
FUCCI:
I haven't turned up
a single text,

10:42.685 --> 10:45.253
phone call or online signal
between them.

10:45.296 --> 10:46.646
So they avoided leaving
an electronic footprint.

10:46.689 --> 10:48.865
But the calendar
is proof of a connection.

10:48.909 --> 10:51.041
Barbara detonated her device
at the exact time and place

10:51.085 --> 10:52.695
that we found
in Ramzy's calendar.

10:52.739 --> 10:54.958
Yeah, and ballistics says
the two bombs are identical.

10:55.002 --> 10:56.699
Still nobody taking credit?Intelligence Bureau's still

10:56.743 --> 10:58.701
sorting through the
chatter. So far, zip.

10:58.745 --> 11:00.964
JASMINE: I suppose the one
piece of good news

11:01.008 --> 11:02.096
is the calendar you found.

11:02.139 --> 11:03.575
The rest of the month is empty.

11:03.619 --> 11:04.664
Let's hope it stays that way.

11:09.407 --> 11:11.018
You sure your segment
is airing tonight?

11:11.061 --> 11:12.323
Past your bedtime?

11:12.367 --> 11:15.065
I was excited about it,
uh, two hours ago.

11:15.109 --> 11:18.373
Since then, I have seen
the three-day forecast,

11:18.416 --> 11:20.244
the seven-day forecast,
a Mr. Food segment

11:20.288 --> 11:22.203
and a story about a
drunk guy who got

11:22.246 --> 11:23.726
into an argument
with a telephone pole.

11:23.770 --> 11:26.424
I surrender.
I'm turning in.

11:26.468 --> 11:28.252
Good night.Night.

11:28.296 --> 11:29.514
Thanks.

11:29.558 --> 11:30.777
Oh, guess what.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.735
New Yorkmagazine

11:32.779 --> 11:34.694
is doing a story
about the squad.

11:34.737 --> 11:36.608
Get out of here.
Yeah.

11:36.652 --> 11:38.741
We're doing a shoot
tomorrow at the precinct.

11:38.785 --> 11:40.482
A shoot? Wow.

11:40.525 --> 11:41.701
And I thought, if they needed

11:41.744 --> 11:43.398
any more photos,
I would suggest Rafters.

11:43.441 --> 11:45.313
You know, cops after work.

11:45.356 --> 11:47.445
Maybe catch you
behind the bar.

11:47.489 --> 11:48.882
Yeah, uh...

11:48.925 --> 11:51.058
Yeah, I don't think so.It would be great publicity.

11:51.101 --> 11:53.103
Well... I'm from the Midwest.

11:53.147 --> 11:54.888
You know, we're not really
as comfortable

11:54.931 --> 11:56.454
with the limelight as you.

11:56.498 --> 11:58.718
Wh

11:58.761 --> 12:01.546
Nothing. I'm just...

12:01.590 --> 12:03.592
Are you saying
I am seeking the limelight?

12:03.635 --> 12:04.767
Well, aren't you?

12:05.812 --> 12:07.901
What are you talking about?

12:07.944 --> 12:09.511
Okay, the man I married
was a brilliant,

12:09.554 --> 12:10.686
cagey psychologist.

12:10.730 --> 12:11.948
Now you have a publicist?

12:11.992 --> 12:13.776
Oh, I do not have
a publicist.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.517
It was a five-minute
meeting.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.127
Which led to this
magazine story.

12:17.171 --> 12:18.650
Which I'm hoping
will include you.

12:18.694 --> 12:21.653
I don't want my life on display.

12:24.700 --> 12:27.964
You know what, Andy?

12:28.008 --> 12:30.401
Anything you do, I am proud of.

12:30.445 --> 12:31.576
Anything.

12:31.620 --> 12:33.796
You have a good month
at the bar,

12:33.840 --> 12:35.580
I'm proud of
your business acumen.

12:35.624 --> 12:36.799
You have a bad month
at the bar,

12:36.843 --> 12:38.105
I'm proud
of your resilience.

12:38.148 --> 12:40.150
I don't care if you finish

12:40.194 --> 12:43.980
the New York City Marathon
or the damn Jumble.

12:46.026 --> 12:49.986
Stupid me to think
you would feel the same way.

12:50.030 --> 12:51.727
Please.

12:51.771 --> 12:54.121
Turn off the TV.

12:54.164 --> 12:56.688
I'd hate to think my segment
would further enrage

12:56.732 --> 12:59.604
your moral indignation.

13:15.882 --> 13:17.840
Mind if I join you?

13:20.234 --> 13:21.713
Wow.

13:21.757 --> 13:23.541
Dylan's super special,
secret friend

13:23.585 --> 13:25.108
has come all the way
to Forest Hills

13:25.152 --> 13:26.762
for a slice at Ray's.

13:26.806 --> 13:30.070
Three enthusiastic
Yelp reviews can't be wrong.

13:35.466 --> 13:36.903
Actually, I've wanted
to thank you

13:36.946 --> 13:40.428
for proving Charlie's innocence.

13:40.471 --> 13:44.084
Losing him was really hard,
but at least now I have peace.

13:44.127 --> 13:46.695
It was my pleasure.

13:46.738 --> 13:48.784
I need to ask a favor.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.438
Shouldn't we be meeting
on a park bench

13:50.481 --> 13:52.135
or a bridge shrouded
in darkness?

13:52.179 --> 13:55.878
Even spies occasionally come in
from the cold for a hot slice.

13:55.922 --> 13:58.881
Mm, somehow you don't strike me
as a pizza kind of guy.

13:58.925 --> 14:00.056
I'm not.

14:00.100 --> 14:02.276
My palate is quite refined.

14:02.319 --> 14:04.017
Need something, pal?Four garlic knots

14:04.060 --> 14:06.846
and a pepperoni
pinwheel, please.Hmm.

14:10.023 --> 14:11.851
So, this is not too
public for you?

14:11.894 --> 14:13.591
Being too public
is not my problem.

14:13.635 --> 14:14.897
It's your partner's.

14:14.941 --> 14:16.464
That's why I wanted
to talk to you.

14:16.507 --> 14:18.248
Okay.

14:18.292 --> 14:21.817
Dylan is being unwise
becoming a public figure.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.601
It's dangerous.

14:23.645 --> 14:25.429
Sounds like you should warn him.

14:25.473 --> 14:27.170
I tried.

14:27.214 --> 14:28.998
He didn't listen.

14:30.043 --> 14:31.827
There was a former
MI6 officer

14:31.871 --> 14:33.263
named Tony Collins.

14:33.307 --> 14:34.917
He wrote a tell-all,

14:34.961 --> 14:36.832
began discussing his work
on television,

14:36.876 --> 14:38.486
did the whole circuit.

14:38.529 --> 14:40.357
Became so distracted
by the attention

14:40.401 --> 14:43.056
that he stopped taking
proper precautions.

14:43.099 --> 14:45.885
They found him floating
in Hackney Brook.

14:45.928 --> 14:48.278
You really think Dylan
is endangering his life?

14:48.322 --> 14:50.454
Let's just say
he's making me nervous.

14:50.498 --> 14:53.414
You don't strike me
as the nervous type.

14:53.457 --> 14:55.851
Spies and nervous systems
have similar functions:

14:55.895 --> 14:57.287
extract and process information

14:57.331 --> 14:59.942
to determine an appropriate
threat level.

14:59.986 --> 15:01.813
And no, I'm not
the nervous type.

15:01.857 --> 15:04.904
So, when I feel this way,
it's usually for a good reason.

15:06.514 --> 15:08.777
Dylan's a big boy, and, um,

15:08.820 --> 15:10.387
I'm not in the habit
of keeping secrets

15:10.431 --> 15:12.650
from my partner.

15:13.608 --> 15:15.131
Wait.

15:23.792 --> 15:25.620
Just in case.

15:25.663 --> 15:29.667
And, uh, if I were to call,
what would I call you?

15:31.234 --> 15:33.236
Julian.

15:46.554 --> 15:48.338
Ramzy and Barbara
showed no warning signs

15:48.382 --> 15:50.558
of being radicalized,
which leaves us nowhere.

15:50.601 --> 15:52.255
Don't drive yourself crazy.

15:52.299 --> 15:53.604
When the evidence
from their apartments

15:53.648 --> 15:55.389
gets here, we'll find a lead.

15:55.432 --> 15:56.694
When's it getting here?ASHLEY: Excuse me.
I don't want it there.

15:56.738 --> 15:58.000
Hopefully by the time
your lunatic publicist

15:58.044 --> 15:59.697
wraps up this dog-and-pony show.ASHLEY: Thank you.

15:59.741 --> 16:01.264
She's not my publicist.ASHLEY: Don't tidy up too much.

16:01.308 --> 16:02.570
Keep it real,
grounded.

16:02.613 --> 16:03.919
Not that grounded.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.443
Get rid of any food
that is blue or moldy.

16:06.487 --> 16:08.532
No time for second thoughts.
The brass love the idea.

16:08.576 --> 16:10.143
Look at you.Don't start.

16:10.186 --> 16:12.884
:
This can only be good
for your promotion.

16:12.928 --> 16:14.103
You're a terrible
whisperer.

16:14.147 --> 16:16.149
Promotion

16:16.192 --> 16:17.411
I'm fluent in seven languages,
and I have

16:17.454 --> 16:18.542
no idea
what you're trying to say.

16:18.586 --> 16:19.891
Okay, it's far from a done deal.

16:19.935 --> 16:20.980
Can we just keep it...

16:21.023 --> 16:22.024
Yeah, on the DL?

16:22.068 --> 16:23.460
Sure.ASHLEY: Pardon me.

16:23.504 --> 16:26.376
Hi. Are you a Mennonite, dear?Um, no.

16:26.420 --> 16:29.640
'Cause it wouldn't kill you to,
you know, take your hair down.

16:29.684 --> 16:31.294
Maria says that with the, uh,
proper shading,

16:31.338 --> 16:32.817
I look like a young Paul Newman.

16:32.861 --> 16:34.384
Is there another Paul Newman
I don't know about?

16:34.428 --> 16:36.517
ASHLEY: Okay!

16:36.560 --> 16:37.692
Let's line up, everyone.

16:37.735 --> 16:38.780
Oh!Oh! That's the stuff

16:38.823 --> 16:39.868
from Barbara
and Ramzy's apartments.

16:39.911 --> 16:41.000
Uh, conference room, guys.Uh-uh.

16:41.043 --> 16:43.524
Get back in line,
Batman and Robin.

16:43.567 --> 16:45.178
Okay, uh, let's do this.

16:45.221 --> 16:46.831
We have work to do.

16:46.875 --> 16:48.790
Okay, this is gonna
be a long day.ASHLEY: Excuse me, honey.

16:48.833 --> 16:50.052
Oh, sorry.We're on either side

16:50.096 --> 16:51.662
of the man wearing
more makeup than you.

16:51.706 --> 16:53.490
Eyes forward, super cops.

16:53.534 --> 16:55.623
One, two, three.

16:57.233 --> 16:58.669
DYLAN:
For a small apartment,

16:58.713 --> 17:01.194
Ramzy sure had a lot of stuff.

17:01.237 --> 17:03.109
Maybe CCU will have more luck
with their computers.

17:03.152 --> 17:04.980
I can't find anything.Check this out.

17:05.024 --> 17:07.156
A prescription for
antidepressants.

17:07.200 --> 17:08.157
Wait.

17:08.201 --> 17:10.116
This is fake.

17:10.159 --> 17:13.989
The doctor's signature
is initials only: AWB.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.425
DYLAN:
And there's no license number.

17:15.469 --> 17:16.992
This prescription
is dated today.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.429
Yeah, and Ramzy died yesterday.

17:20.778 --> 17:22.824
And on the back,
there's tomorrow's date.

17:22.867 --> 17:24.565
What are you thinking?

17:24.608 --> 17:26.523
Everything about this
is phony.

17:26.567 --> 17:28.699
A dosage of
150.8 milligrams?

17:28.743 --> 17:30.832
That's nonsense.Why leave a fake dosage?

17:30.875 --> 17:32.616
150.8.

17:32.660 --> 17:34.227
Numbers. 1-5-0-8.

17:34.270 --> 17:35.750
1508?

17:35.793 --> 17:37.578
You think it's another clue?
Like the calendar?

17:37.621 --> 17:39.014
Well, if it is,
it's a clue that only

17:39.058 --> 17:40.668
a doctor or a psychologist
would know.

17:40.711 --> 17:42.626
It also implies another
attack today at 3:08.

17:42.670 --> 17:44.324
In less than four hours.

17:44.367 --> 17:46.456
Barbara and Ramzy
were working with someone else.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.763
This is an obscure way
to announce an attack.

17:48.806 --> 17:50.678
Unless it's not the code
for the next bombing.

17:50.721 --> 17:51.853
You think someone's
playing with us?

17:51.896 --> 17:54.638
Um, maybe I'm just
grasping at straws.

17:54.682 --> 17:56.466
No, you're not.
Look at the address.

17:56.510 --> 17:58.425
This is Ramzy's apartment.
What the hell?

17:58.468 --> 18:00.557
Why leave us an address
we've already searched?

18:00.601 --> 18:03.082
Maybe we
missed something.

18:03.125 --> 18:05.214
Well, if there is a clue here,

18:05.258 --> 18:07.347
it doesn't have many
places to hide.

18:07.390 --> 18:09.392
Nope.

18:09.436 --> 18:11.525
â™ª

18:35.984 --> 18:37.464
Nothing.

18:37.507 --> 18:39.118
Nothing.

18:41.511 --> 18:43.078
The ceiling.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.906
Yes, that's
a ceiling.

18:44.949 --> 18:46.168
No, but look.

18:46.212 --> 18:48.475
Th-There's an "M."

18:48.518 --> 18:49.780
LIZZIE:
What, that crack?

18:49.824 --> 18:50.912
That's not a crack.

18:50.955 --> 18:52.566
That was etched there,
into the paint.

18:52.609 --> 18:55.177
Why would someone etch lines
onto a ceiling?

18:55.221 --> 18:57.440
Well, like you said,
maybe someone's playing with us.

18:57.484 --> 18:59.050
Okay, but "M" is not a number.

18:59.094 --> 19:00.835
It was in
Roman times.

19:00.878 --> 19:02.445
A thousand.

19:02.489 --> 19:05.318
And it's next to the fan.

19:11.976 --> 19:13.587
MX.

19:13.630 --> 19:16.111
1010 in Roman numerals.

19:16.155 --> 19:19.158
What location
does 1010 correspond to?

19:22.422 --> 19:23.684
Bethesda Fountain.

19:23.727 --> 19:24.728
Okay, well, at least we have

19:24.772 --> 19:26.077
a couple of hours notice
this time.

19:26.121 --> 19:28.079
You better call it in.Hang on.

19:28.123 --> 19:30.647
You want me to mobilize
bomb squad, CRC,

19:30.691 --> 19:32.519
CSU and ESU
based on a scratch,

19:32.562 --> 19:34.129
a ceiling fan
and Roman numerals?

19:34.173 --> 19:36.044
I do.
Are you crazy?

19:36.087 --> 19:38.089
If this is a clue,
how could anyone

19:38.133 --> 19:39.439
be expected
to solve it?

19:39.482 --> 19:42.224
Look, maybe we're not dealing
with a terror cell.

19:42.268 --> 19:44.095
Maybe we're dealing
with some kind of mastermind

19:44.139 --> 19:45.706
who thinks in numbers
and can recruit followers

19:45.749 --> 19:47.098
who will die for him.

19:47.142 --> 19:49.492
You have to trust me on this.

19:50.580 --> 19:52.887
Okay. Let's do this.

19:52.930 --> 19:54.193
Thank you.

19:55.977 --> 19:58.501
Remember, the color of the day
is purple.

19:58.545 --> 20:02.070
Everyone be careful and call out
anything unusual you see.

20:02.113 --> 20:04.986
Stay focused
and watch each other's sixes.

20:09.991 --> 20:12.211
2:00. Long black coat.

20:14.996 --> 20:18.042
Male, 50s, long black coat,
moving east.

20:20.958 --> 20:23.918
Right on time.
Police! Hands!
Let me see your hands!

20:23.961 --> 20:26.094
Let's go! Let's go!Don't move, sir! Don't move!

20:26.137 --> 20:28.444
It's under my coat.

20:38.280 --> 20:39.238
What?

20:40.848 --> 20:42.850
Who gave this to you?A friend.

20:42.893 --> 20:44.373
Who's your friend?
What's his name?

20:44.417 --> 20:46.984
He gave me $50.

20:47.028 --> 20:48.334
Oh, my...

20:51.032 --> 20:53.121
It's 3:08.

20:55.471 --> 20:57.038
LIZZIE:
Go.

21:06.743 --> 21:08.963
One casualty.
Just the perp again.

21:09.006 --> 21:11.313
The blast radius
was about ten feet again.

21:11.357 --> 21:12.749
Same small device.

21:12.793 --> 21:14.925
I thought I had
the right location.

21:14.969 --> 21:16.884
Well, he obviously wanted us
to go to the fountain.

21:16.927 --> 21:19.974
The guy with the note.
It's okay.

21:20.017 --> 21:21.541
What have you got?A neighbor said

21:21.584 --> 21:24.500
the guy got on his motorcycle,
started it, and boom.

21:25.545 --> 21:26.807
What kind of a bomber

21:26.850 --> 21:29.070
gets on a motorcycle, starts it,

21:29.113 --> 21:31.768
and then blows himself up
in the middle of a quiet street?

21:31.812 --> 21:32.813
I don't know.

21:38.906 --> 21:42.605
DYLAN:
What if the bombers
aren't bombers...

21:44.128 --> 21:46.217
...but innocents?

21:47.393 --> 21:48.916
Strangers.

21:52.572 --> 21:54.835
Unless he wasn't
a suicide bomber.

21:54.878 --> 21:59.492
Maybe he didn't know there was
a bomb in his saddlebag.

21:59.535 --> 22:01.972
That would explain why Barbara
didn't have any tells

22:02.016 --> 22:04.192
and Ramzy didn't fit
the profile of a bomber.

22:04.235 --> 22:06.847
They weren't bombers.

22:06.890 --> 22:08.631
They were victims.

22:08.675 --> 22:10.546
Once ballistics is finished
rebuilding the detonators,

22:10.590 --> 22:12.418
we'll be able to tell
if they were dummies.

22:12.461 --> 22:14.768
So, if Ramzy wasn't part
of a cell, that means someone

22:14.811 --> 22:17.727
went to the trouble
of staging his apartment.

22:17.771 --> 22:19.250
Someone is...

22:24.995 --> 22:26.214
Dylan?

22:27.258 --> 22:29.130
This used to be
Meacham Townhouse.

22:29.173 --> 22:32.263
The Meacham Townhouse?
How do you know that?

22:32.307 --> 22:34.178
Because I've been
here before.

22:35.658 --> 22:38.269
And I don't think
this is a coincidence.

22:38.313 --> 22:40.184
This is personal.

22:53.937 --> 22:55.678
When I was 15, I was invited

22:55.722 --> 22:57.550
to participate
in a two-week program

22:57.593 --> 23:00.161
for gifted students
at Meacham Townhouse.

23:00.204 --> 23:02.990
Dylan thinks the guy who ran
this program fits the profile

23:03.033 --> 23:05.340
of someone who's capable of
carrying out these attacks.

23:05.384 --> 23:06.646
What's his name?

23:06.689 --> 23:08.604
Dr. Avery W. Beams.

23:08.648 --> 23:10.824
AWB-- the same
initials we found

23:10.867 --> 23:12.565
on the prescription slip.

23:12.608 --> 23:14.436
Harris, Zack, find
out all you can

23:14.480 --> 23:15.698
about this Dr. Beams.
On it.

23:15.742 --> 23:18.484
Yes, ma'am.
Bomb squad
verified your hunch.

23:18.527 --> 23:20.007
The detonators were dummies.

23:20.050 --> 23:21.225
Which means that
if it is Beams,

23:21.269 --> 23:22.966
he was in the vicinity
before each attack

23:23.010 --> 23:24.664
in order to slip the device
into the victims' pockets.

23:24.707 --> 23:26.579
And to detonate
the bombs remotely.

23:26.622 --> 23:28.276
So the other bomb sites

23:28.319 --> 23:29.843
had something to do
with Beams, too?

23:29.886 --> 23:31.627
I...

23:31.671 --> 23:33.281
I don't know.

23:33.324 --> 23:34.543
JASMINE: Well,
eat some spinach,

23:34.587 --> 23:36.110
drink a damn sports
drink-- I don't care.

23:36.153 --> 23:37.328
Just do whatever you gotta do

23:37.372 --> 23:38.460
to kick that giant brain
of yours

23:38.504 --> 23:41.071
into high gear.I'll do my best.

23:41.115 --> 23:42.899
Are you okay?

23:42.943 --> 23:45.424
You seem a bit off.I keep guessing wrong,

23:45.467 --> 23:48.252
and every time I do,
someone dies.

23:48.296 --> 23:49.602
It's not a feeling that

23:49.645 --> 23:51.995
Mr. Hot Shot Consultant
is used to.

23:52.039 --> 23:55.085
One question I haven't asked:

23:55.129 --> 23:57.305
Why would Dr. Beams
want to hurt you?

23:57.348 --> 23:59.350
You were a kid.I don't know.

24:00.482 --> 24:02.832
The program started out
well enough...

24:02.876 --> 24:06.009
before it took a turn.

24:06.053 --> 24:08.969
Maybe it's because Beams
couldn't break me.

24:09.012 --> 24:10.274
Break you?

24:10.318 --> 24:12.276
Dylan, what kind of
a program was this?

24:12.320 --> 24:13.756
We found Dr. Beams' obituary.

24:13.800 --> 24:15.497
Died 11 years ago.
Not our guy.

24:15.541 --> 24:17.499
Thanks. Uh...

24:17.543 --> 24:20.284
Anyone else from this program
that would want to hurt you?

24:20.328 --> 24:22.199
The only other people
I remember were kids.

24:22.243 --> 24:23.374
Maybe this is a dead end.

24:23.418 --> 24:25.333
We should keep working
our other leads.

24:25.376 --> 24:27.422
No. The initials

24:27.466 --> 24:29.990
We went down that path
and came up empty.

24:30.033 --> 24:31.731
Is it worth calling
your super special,

24:31.774 --> 24:32.949
secret friend?
No.

24:34.342 --> 24:37.388
Okay.

24:37.432 --> 24:39.521
Okay, let's go over Ramzy's
list of passengers,

24:39.565 --> 24:41.567
see if he had any
repeat customers.

24:41.610 --> 24:44.178
And we should also
revisit the CCTV footage.

24:44.221 --> 24:47.747
So, you get started on Ramzy,
and I'll head over to TARU.

25:10.421 --> 25:12.423
â™ª

25:26.742 --> 25:29.484
Now, this would make a
great magazine cover.

25:29.528 --> 25:30.877
Consultant
for the police

25:30.920 --> 25:32.705
working late after
his shift is over.

25:32.748 --> 25:34.663
Dedication.

25:34.707 --> 25:36.970
I'm sorry if I surprised you.

25:37.013 --> 25:38.972
It's a nice surprise.I won't stay long.

25:39.015 --> 25:41.365
I-I know you're
probably busy, but, uh,

25:41.409 --> 25:43.759
I also know you probably
haven't fed yourself.

25:43.803 --> 25:46.283
Yeah, I don't have much
of an appetite right now.

25:46.327 --> 25:48.851
I just feel like...

25:48.895 --> 25:50.461
I'm completely useless.

25:50.505 --> 25:52.507
Well, that's unlike you.

25:52.551 --> 25:55.684
Still, takeout Chinese is
light on the stomach, right?

25:55.728 --> 25:57.556
I mean, when my dad had
his gallbladder out,

25:57.599 --> 25:59.383
they gave him Jell-O and
Cantonese barbecued pork.

26:02.169 --> 26:04.388
Look, I'm... I'm really sorry
for what I said last night.

26:04.432 --> 26:06.390
I got upset

26:06.434 --> 26:07.870
because...

26:07.914 --> 26:09.611
I haven't told you something.

26:09.655 --> 26:12.396
The real reason I
didn't want to be

26:12.440 --> 26:15.095
in the magazine article
is because...

26:15.138 --> 26:18.228
I haven't told my folks
I gave up being a lawyer.

26:18.272 --> 26:20.274
What?

26:21.536 --> 26:24.452
The man who came out
to his parents at 16

26:24.495 --> 26:26.802
is too afraid to tell them
he's had a career change?

26:26.846 --> 26:29.196
It was more than just
a... a career change.

26:29.239 --> 26:32.416
I mean, when I passed the bar,
it was their proudest moment.

26:32.460 --> 26:33.766
I was their son,
the lawyer.

26:33.809 --> 26:35.594
First lawyer
in the family.

26:35.637 --> 26:37.073
My folks worked
their asses off

26:37.117 --> 26:38.466
to put me through
law school, so...

26:38.509 --> 26:40.207
the last thing they want to hear
is that I threw

26:40.250 --> 26:42.426
their tuition money
and my law degree down the drain

26:42.470 --> 26:44.603
to do the same job
as my Uncle Otis.

26:46.822 --> 26:49.912
If they accept who you love,

26:49.956 --> 26:52.001
they'll accept what you love.

26:52.045 --> 26:55.265
That's... that is...
that's really beautiful, Dylan,

26:55.309 --> 26:58.573
and completely wrong.

26:59.835 --> 27:01.881
Well, just tell them
that you bought the bar

27:01.924 --> 27:03.230
as an investment
with all the money

27:03.273 --> 27:04.797
from your fancy law firm.

27:04.840 --> 27:06.276
Hmm?

27:06.320 --> 27:08.191
You see, you're not
completely useless.

27:08.235 --> 27:09.932
You know, it's
crazy, I...

27:09.976 --> 27:13.414
I have always dreamt
of owning my own business,

27:13.457 --> 27:18.071
and yet letting my parents down
is a lifelong fear.

27:18.114 --> 27:19.725
You believe that?
I am a grown man

27:19.768 --> 27:22.249
whose childhood dreams are still
in a steel-cage death match

27:22.292 --> 27:25.208
against my childhood
fears.

27:28.777 --> 27:30.344
DYLAN:
Childhood dreams.

27:31.867 --> 27:34.609
Not "MX." "MT."

27:38.221 --> 27:40.093
Meacham Townhouse.

27:42.095 --> 27:44.227
I am so sorry, Andy,
but I've got to go.

27:44.271 --> 27:45.881
Sorry.

27:51.844 --> 27:56.718
â™ª Something's got
a hold on me... â™ª

28:13.692 --> 28:14.997
Care for a drink?

28:15.041 --> 28:16.607
No, thanks. Working.

28:16.651 --> 28:18.435
I have to say I was
surprised you called.

28:18.479 --> 28:19.610
Yeah, so was I.

28:19.654 --> 28:21.525
So, did you find
anything?

28:21.569 --> 28:24.224
I did, indeed.

28:24.267 --> 28:26.182
In the late '80s
and early '90s,

28:26.226 --> 28:27.923
there was a bit of
controversy surrounding

28:27.967 --> 28:30.230
a program for gifted students
at the Meacham Townhouse.

28:30.273 --> 28:31.666
What kind of controversy?

28:31.710 --> 28:33.276
I'm not sure,

28:33.320 --> 28:36.236
but from what I was able
to piece together,

28:36.279 --> 28:38.978
there was some kind of unethical
psychological experiment

28:39.021 --> 28:40.588
conducted on unwilling teens.

28:40.631 --> 28:43.547
How come I wasn't able
to find any of this?

28:43.591 --> 28:45.071
It appears the test
was conducted

28:45.114 --> 28:47.160
in concert with the government.

28:47.203 --> 28:49.162
Which is why
the test files

28:49.205 --> 28:52.034
and the participants'
names have been redacted.

28:52.078 --> 28:53.644
Took quite a lot of digging
to unearth

28:53.688 --> 28:55.603
what little information
I was able to find.

28:55.646 --> 28:58.301
The government? I think
I'll have that drink now.

28:59.825 --> 29:01.870
Sorry I couldn't find
more specifics.

29:01.914 --> 29:03.785
Dylan knows
the specifics.

29:06.570 --> 29:08.747
Dylan was involved?

29:11.097 --> 29:13.316
My God, was he one of the kids?

29:13.360 --> 29:16.363
I don't know. He doesn't want
to talk about it.

29:16.406 --> 29:18.321
And you think

29:18.365 --> 29:19.932
Dylan is connected
to the bombings?

29:19.975 --> 29:21.368
Again, don't know.

29:21.411 --> 29:24.240
The only viable suspect
died 11 years ago.

29:24.284 --> 29:26.677
But whatever this is
all about, I'm pretty sure

29:26.721 --> 29:29.115
it has something to do
with the experiment.

29:53.095 --> 29:54.793
Hey, Dylan.

30:11.461 --> 30:13.463
This won't hurt a bit.

30:22.777 --> 30:25.954
No such thing as
coincidences.

30:28.087 --> 30:29.915
I know there aren't.

30:29.958 --> 30:31.960
Tell me what happened.

30:33.440 --> 30:35.616
You can trust me.

30:37.357 --> 30:40.142
It was called
The Whitford Project.

30:40.186 --> 30:42.275
Psychology gone off the rails.

30:42.318 --> 30:43.798
In what way?

30:43.842 --> 30:46.975
Like I said, the first week
of camp was fun--

30:47.019 --> 30:51.284
lectures, debates,
academic competitions.

30:51.327 --> 30:54.287
Then one afternoon
during the second week,

30:54.330 --> 30:56.332
we were each given a partner.

30:56.376 --> 30:59.640
Mine was a nervous,
awkward kid...

30:59.683 --> 31:01.250
like me.

31:02.469 --> 31:03.774
And we were instructed

31:03.818 --> 31:06.908
to spend every second
with one another

31:06.952 --> 31:10.390
and to share our innermost
hopes and dreams.

31:10.433 --> 31:12.871
My partner said...

31:12.914 --> 31:16.178
I'm gonna devise a comprehensive
theory of optimal processes,

31:16.222 --> 31:19.094
win the Fields Medal, and solve
the Riemann hypothesis.

31:19.138 --> 31:20.530
DYLAN:
And I said...

31:20.574 --> 31:23.229
Study all over the world.

31:23.272 --> 31:25.100
Play with the Philharmonic.

31:25.144 --> 31:28.538
Ride a motorcycle
just like my father.

31:28.582 --> 31:30.497
Just like our victims.

31:30.540 --> 31:33.413
One a foreign student,
one a musician,

31:33.456 --> 31:34.718
and one on a motorcycle.

31:34.762 --> 31:37.504
Same one as my dad had.

31:37.547 --> 31:39.723
And Beams ran the test?

31:39.767 --> 31:42.509
Yes.

31:42.552 --> 31:44.946
He wanted to see how
much we could endure.

31:44.990 --> 31:46.992
What the threshold was
to break us.

31:47.035 --> 31:48.558
This won't hurt a bit.

31:48.602 --> 31:51.648
DYLAN: He monitored
our reactions to stress.

31:52.954 --> 31:54.913
LIZZIE:
What kind of stress?

31:54.956 --> 31:57.480
DYLAN:
He humiliated us.

31:57.524 --> 32:01.093
Told us our partners
had belittled our dreams.

32:01.136 --> 32:04.096
Undermined everything
we hoped to accomplish.

32:04.139 --> 32:07.055
A 12-year-old writing a concerto
with the Philharmonic?

32:07.099 --> 32:09.405
Why not a ballerina?

32:10.841 --> 32:13.235
That was your partner's joke.

32:13.279 --> 32:15.498
You know it's fully unrealistic,

32:15.542 --> 32:16.935
right?

32:16.978 --> 32:19.546
You're mediocre at best,
according to your partner.

32:19.589 --> 32:20.634
Young man,

32:20.677 --> 32:22.288
he's heard you practicing,

32:22.331 --> 32:24.551
and he's thinks you're,
well, deluded.

32:24.594 --> 32:26.683
I don't believe you.

32:29.121 --> 32:32.341
I was so sure it was Beams...

32:32.385 --> 32:35.344
because he knew all my dreams.

32:35.388 --> 32:37.477
But Beams is dead.

32:37.520 --> 32:41.220
And he's not the only one
you told your dreams to.

32:41.263 --> 32:42.917
What was your
partner's name?

32:47.269 --> 32:48.923
John Raymond.

32:51.491 --> 32:53.145
His name is John Raymond?

32:53.188 --> 32:54.494
Yes, and Raymond
may have suffered

32:54.537 --> 32:56.670
psychological damage
from the experiment.

32:56.713 --> 32:58.846
My guess is antisocial
personality disorder.

32:58.889 --> 33:00.413
Whoa, whoa, don't tell me
what you guess.

33:00.456 --> 33:02.458
Tell me what you know.He's a brilliant guy.

33:02.502 --> 33:04.156
Got his PhD.DYLAN:
In mathematics.

33:04.199 --> 33:06.288
Which he talked about
all the time when he was a kid.

33:06.332 --> 33:07.768
He liked nothing more
than number puzzles.

33:07.811 --> 33:10.031
And now he's talking
to us-- to Dylan--

33:10.075 --> 33:11.598
with numbers.
Okay.

33:11.641 --> 33:13.034
Still listening.

33:13.078 --> 33:14.601
He taught at some
top universities.

33:14.644 --> 33:16.168
But the jobs never lasted
very long.

33:16.211 --> 33:17.647
He got poor evaluations
or didn't

33:17.691 --> 33:18.866
get along with his colleagues.

33:18.909 --> 33:20.563
He bounced around...Until a few years ago,

33:20.607 --> 33:22.652
when he landed
at a community college

33:22.696 --> 33:24.741
in Hudson Valley.Where he finally

33:24.785 --> 33:27.527
published his opus
and was fired for plagiarism.

33:27.570 --> 33:30.051
That's the trigger?Dylan was the trigger.

33:30.095 --> 33:32.575
The book he plagiarized
was Freaks,my book.

33:32.619 --> 33:34.577
It seems the publicity

33:34.621 --> 33:36.144
surrounding Dylan's
book's release

33:36.188 --> 33:38.146
coincided with Raymond's
deterioration.

33:38.190 --> 33:40.409
Where's Raymond now?Uh, well, we have no idea.

33:40.453 --> 33:41.845
He disappeared
off the face of the earth.

33:41.889 --> 33:44.152
No credit cards, no bank
account, no phone number.

33:52.160 --> 33:55.120
I don't know where he is,
but I know where he's been.

33:55.163 --> 33:56.947
The bomb site at the band shell.

33:56.991 --> 33:59.559
He had to have been
there to plant the bomb.What?

33:59.602 --> 34:00.777
The one we profiled
is John Raymond.

34:00.821 --> 34:02.997
I was so busy
looking for the bomber

34:03.041 --> 34:04.868
I didn't see it was John.

34:04.912 --> 34:06.609
It was 30 years ago.

34:06.653 --> 34:08.959
This means he detonated
the bomb with a timer.

34:09.003 --> 34:10.831
Yeah, so okay, we know
what he looks like,

34:10.874 --> 34:11.962
but unfortunately,
we don't know

34:12.006 --> 34:13.268
where he's going to attack.

34:13.312 --> 34:14.835
Oh, he was luring me in
from the start.

34:14.878 --> 34:16.750
He knew I'd want this case.

34:16.793 --> 34:18.752
He blames me
for destroying his dreams,

34:18.795 --> 34:21.668
and now he is determined
to destroy mine.

34:21.711 --> 34:23.539
We should run any numbers
associated with Raymond's past

34:23.583 --> 34:25.237
that could nail down
the time and location

34:25.280 --> 34:26.673
of today's attack.

34:26.716 --> 34:28.153
JASMINE: The attacks
are aimed at Dylan,

34:28.196 --> 34:31.591
so maybe the numeric clue is...
is personal to you.

34:31.634 --> 34:33.158
We need a list
of all your numbers:

34:33.201 --> 34:35.899
social, faculty I.D.,
bank accounts.

34:37.162 --> 34:40.556
Check the GPS coordinates 4753.

34:43.690 --> 34:45.300
Steppingstone Park.

34:47.824 --> 34:50.175
That's where we had recess.

34:50.218 --> 34:52.133
11:23 a.m., Steppingstone Park.

34:52.177 --> 34:53.700
That's where he'll be.

34:53.743 --> 34:55.615
Are you sure?Yes, yes.

34:55.658 --> 34:58.096
We weren't allowed to refer
to each other by name

34:58.139 --> 34:59.575
during the experiment.

34:59.619 --> 35:01.186
We had to use
our test subject numbers.

35:01.229 --> 35:03.579
John Raymond's number
was 11234753.

35:03.623 --> 35:05.103
How do you
remember that?

35:05.146 --> 35:08.280
Because mine was 11234754.

35:08.323 --> 35:10.238
1123-- 11:23.

35:10.282 --> 35:13.198
I'll mobilize snipers,
bomb squad and CRC.

35:13.241 --> 35:14.851
And we have three hours
to figure out

35:14.895 --> 35:16.679
whose pocket Raymond's gonna
plant the next bomb in.

35:16.723 --> 35:20.248
Oh, I think I know the answer
to that one, too.

35:20.292 --> 35:21.293
You do?

35:22.946 --> 35:25.645
There was one more dream
I shared with John.

35:41.095 --> 35:43.097
â™ª

35:58.982 --> 36:00.767
Hello, John.

36:04.336 --> 36:05.815
Sorry I didn't recognize you
at the park,

36:05.859 --> 36:08.905
but it has been
quite a few years.

36:08.949 --> 36:12.213
Stay where you are.You, too.

36:12.257 --> 36:14.911
Take your hands out
of your pockets.

36:14.955 --> 36:16.696
You won't shoot me.No.

36:16.739 --> 36:18.524
She would.

36:19.655 --> 36:21.222
And they would.

36:21.266 --> 36:24.356
JOHN: I've got more
than one bomb.

36:29.274 --> 36:32.320
You didn't deserve
what happened to you, John.

36:32.364 --> 36:34.931
But neither did
those people who died.

36:34.975 --> 36:37.369
It's Beams you should
be angry with.

36:37.412 --> 36:39.632
Who we should both
be angry with.

36:39.675 --> 36:41.373
I know.

36:41.416 --> 36:43.549
That's why I killed him.

36:43.592 --> 36:45.638
Told him it wouldn't hurt a bit.

36:45.681 --> 36:47.379
I lied.

36:48.423 --> 36:49.511
You once had dreams

36:49.555 --> 36:51.426
to accomplish
something big, John.

36:51.470 --> 36:53.428
Something noble.

36:53.472 --> 36:55.430
I have no dreams.

36:55.474 --> 36:57.954
But I remember all of yours.

36:57.998 --> 36:59.826
I know.

36:59.869 --> 37:01.871
That's why you chose
the baby carriage.

37:01.915 --> 37:03.960
Because I once told you

37:04.004 --> 37:06.441
how much I wanted
to be a father.

37:08.922 --> 37:12.491
Why do you get everything
while I have nothing?

37:12.534 --> 37:15.015
I always believed in you, John.

37:15.058 --> 37:18.932
You were the best
mathematical mind I ever met.

37:18.975 --> 37:21.543
What do you think
about the recent stab

37:21.587 --> 37:23.589
at the Riemann hypothesis?

37:23.632 --> 37:25.547
The proof seemed flawed
to me, but I...

37:25.591 --> 37:26.983
I can't say why.

37:27.027 --> 37:29.159
Well, they got
the zeta function wrong.

37:29.203 --> 37:30.900
Then tackle that.

37:30.944 --> 37:32.511
All you ever needed was time,

37:32.554 --> 37:34.513
and now we can
make that happen.

37:34.556 --> 37:36.645
We'll get you the help
you need in a hospital.

37:36.689 --> 37:40.475
But this is the best offer
you will ever get.

37:40.519 --> 37:42.347
Take it.

37:57.623 --> 37:59.538
LIZZIE:
Go, go, go!

37:59.581 --> 38:01.322
Get him out of here.OFFICER: Hands down.

38:09.548 --> 38:12.507
So, I guess this collar will
clinch your promotion, huh?

38:12.551 --> 38:14.727
I'll celebrate
once it becomes official.Huh.

38:14.770 --> 38:16.772
Thanks a lot, jackass.

38:16.816 --> 38:18.774
Hey, I had no
control over...

38:18.818 --> 38:20.428
What was that about?

38:20.472 --> 38:22.996
Oh...

38:23.039 --> 38:24.650
You fired your publicist,
and we got

38:24.693 --> 38:25.781
bumped from the cover.

38:25.825 --> 38:26.826
Thanks a lot, jackass.

38:26.869 --> 38:28.784
There's a picture inside.
Hmm.

38:28.828 --> 38:30.264
Good.

38:30.308 --> 38:32.614
Oh. She was right
about the hair.

38:34.529 --> 38:37.227
:
Oh, I can see why Fucci's upset.

38:37.271 --> 38:39.839
He wasted $20 on a Moroccan
red clay mask for nothing.

38:41.449 --> 38:44.147
The staple's right
through his forehead.

38:45.758 --> 38:47.890
You know,
I never told my parents

38:47.934 --> 38:50.284
about what happened
in the townhouse.

38:50.328 --> 38:52.199
Well, you were a kid.

38:52.242 --> 38:54.332
You probably didn't trust
anyone had your back.

38:55.898 --> 38:59.815
For years, I just assumed
the other kids were fine.

38:59.859 --> 39:01.426
You don't need to blame yourself

39:01.469 --> 39:03.471
for getting through that test
unaffected.

39:03.515 --> 39:05.691
No, I wasn't unaffected.

39:07.823 --> 39:10.739
Just took me 30 years
to find someone

39:10.783 --> 39:13.046
I wanted to share
the memory with.

39:14.177 --> 39:16.136
So thank you.

39:16.179 --> 39:18.399
I trust you've got my back.

39:30.672 --> 39:33.327
So, how did your
publicist take it

39:33.371 --> 39:35.416
when you told her you wouldn't
be working together anymore?

39:35.460 --> 39:36.983
She said,
"That sounds great,"

39:37.026 --> 39:38.419
and then asked
if I'd be interested

39:38.463 --> 39:40.073
in writing a cookbook.

39:40.116 --> 39:41.857
She's not a great listener.

39:41.901 --> 39:45.426
Well, maybe some more quiet
will be good for you.

39:45.470 --> 39:47.428
Maybe.

39:47.472 --> 39:50.431
Sweeping things under the rug
isn't the answer,

39:50.475 --> 39:54.130
but neither is living
your life on display.

39:54.174 --> 39:56.524
Well...

39:56.568 --> 39:59.701
guess that applies
to me, too, huh?

40:01.399 --> 40:03.270
You'll find a way to
break it to them.

40:03.313 --> 40:06.142
Yeah. How about this?
How about, uh...

40:06.186 --> 40:08.536
"Hey, Mom, Dad,
remember that landmark decision

40:08.580 --> 40:10.190
"you thought I'd author?

40:10.233 --> 40:12.192
"Well, today the decision
I made was whether

40:12.235 --> 40:14.455
the daily special should be
coconut shrimp or clam strips."

40:16.544 --> 40:19.460
We are so lucky to be
able to do what we love.

40:19.504 --> 40:20.548
Yeah.

40:20.592 --> 40:22.768
John Raymond caused
a lot of pain,

40:22.811 --> 40:25.510
but he reminded
me to be grateful

40:25.553 --> 40:29.122
for the dreams I've
been able to realize.

40:31.516 --> 40:34.388
Only one left unfulfilled.

40:36.042 --> 40:38.436
You think it's time?

40:40.133 --> 40:41.743
What do you think?

40:41.787 --> 40:46.356
I think we've been
talking about fatherhood

40:46.400 --> 40:49.447
since we fell in love.

40:49.490 --> 40:51.971
Maybe it's time.

40:54.539 --> 40:56.541
Maybe it is.

40:56.584 --> 40:59.718
â™ª Maybe we'll get
40 years together â™ª

40:59.761 --> 41:01.589
â™ª But one day I'll be gone...

41:01.633 --> 41:03.809
So much for quiet
in our lives.

41:03.852 --> 41:04.984
:
Oh, God.
