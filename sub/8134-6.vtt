♪♪

00:05.206 --> 00:06.538
[Clary] There's a box.
It belonged to my father.
Let's go get it.

00:07.008 --> 00:08.941
[Jace]  <i> Previously</i>
<i> on  </i> Shadowhunters...

00:08.943 --> 00:10.209
Is this the box you remember?

00:11.112 --> 00:12.778
I don't know
what any of this is.

00:12.780 --> 00:13.879
Alaric!

00:13.881 --> 00:16.148
Damn it, Alec.
Clary snuck out
of the Institute.

00:16.150 --> 00:17.349
I don't know
where they took her.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.484
What did you do?

00:18.486 --> 00:20.552
You just need to tell us
where the Mortal Cup is.

00:20.554 --> 00:21.720
I don't know where it is.

00:21.722 --> 00:23.322
Would you like to go out
for a drink sometime?

00:23.324 --> 00:24.957
You know, now's not
really a good time for me.

00:24.959 --> 00:26.625
I love a challenge.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.761
Simon!
Get your hands
off me! Clary!

00:30.064 --> 00:31.363
I finally found you, Clary.

00:32.133 --> 00:33.232
That's the alpha leader.

00:33.234 --> 00:35.134
[werewolf whimpering]
What's happening?

00:35.136 --> 00:37.836
When a werewolf
kills the alpha leader,
he becomes the new alpha.

00:37.838 --> 00:39.738
Your friend Luke's
the leader of the pack now.

00:39.740 --> 00:42.341
Oh, my God!
We have to get
him to Magnus.

00:42.343 --> 00:44.209
That's exactly
what we're gonna do.

00:45.146 --> 00:46.478
[Luke groaning]
What happened?

00:46.480 --> 00:48.680
[Simon] He was attacked!
[Clary] He needs a warlock.

00:48.682 --> 00:50.049
[panting] He needs you.

00:50.051 --> 00:51.083
[Luke groans]

00:51.085 --> 00:52.718
[Magnus] Put him here.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.853
[Luke mutters]
Where are you?

00:54.855 --> 00:56.522
[Clary] Luke...

00:56.524 --> 00:57.689
[Luke] I can't find you.

00:57.691 --> 00:58.824
[shushing]

00:58.826 --> 00:59.992
Where are... where are you?

00:59.994 --> 01:01.226
Where are you?

01:02.096 --> 01:03.295
[Luke] Jocelyn!

01:05.699 --> 01:06.799
Where are you?

01:07.735 --> 01:08.967
Jocelyn!

01:12.373 --> 01:13.806
Jocelyn!

01:14.175 --> 01:16.175
[panting]

01:16.944 --> 01:18.610
Where are you?

01:18.612 --> 01:20.345
[Jocelyn]
Where I always was.

01:22.750 --> 01:23.849
I missed you.

01:23.851 --> 01:25.117
I'm here now.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.853
I've been waiting for you.

01:29.223 --> 01:30.422
But I can't stay.

01:31.725 --> 01:33.792
Why?
You know why.

01:34.695 --> 01:36.161
Tell me how to
get you back.

01:36.464 --> 01:38.697
Clary's the key.

01:38.699 --> 01:40.099
You have to help her.

01:40.101 --> 01:42.301
You have to unlock her.

01:42.303 --> 01:44.436
Tell her everything.
I can't.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.939
You have to,
or she'll never
find the Cup.

01:46.941 --> 01:48.941
She has to
find the Cup.

01:48.943 --> 01:50.142
To save you?

01:50.144 --> 01:53.011
No. To stop Valentine.

01:53.380 --> 01:55.013
Jocelyn!
Help her.

01:58.219 --> 01:59.284
Wait!

01:59.286 --> 02:00.319
[panting] Jocelyn!

02:00.321 --> 02:01.487
Jocelyn...

02:01.489 --> 02:04.256
No, Luke, it's Clary.
Can you hear me?

02:04.258 --> 02:06.225
Clary, listen to me.

02:06.227 --> 02:07.759
Listen...
You have to listen to me.

02:07.761 --> 02:09.561
I have to tell you,
just in case--

02:09.563 --> 02:11.230
No, don't even say it, don't.
No, listen to me.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.397
Luke.
No, you need to know! Listen--

02:12.399 --> 02:13.665
Was he bitten
by an alpha?

02:13.667 --> 02:14.933
Yeah, why?

02:14.935 --> 02:16.969
Three, two, one...

02:16.971 --> 02:18.303
[growls]
[Clary] Oh, my God.

02:28.249 --> 02:31.150
[yelling]

02:31.152 --> 02:32.284
Where do you think
you're going?

02:32.286 --> 02:33.352
Hold him down.

02:33.354 --> 02:34.253
[groaning]

02:35.689 --> 02:37.589
We don't have a lot of time.

02:40.161 --> 02:42.194
It'll take a few
moments to take effect.

02:42.196 --> 02:43.195
What's happening to him?

02:43.197 --> 02:45.164
Random werewolf
transformation.

02:45.166 --> 02:47.299
It's a side effect of the
poison in the alpha bite.

02:47.301 --> 02:49.501
[grunting]

02:53.140 --> 02:55.641
You're sure the Seelies think
Valentine killed their scouts?

02:55.643 --> 02:57.643
It's why they've broken off
contact with the Clave.

02:57.645 --> 02:59.211
They're considering
switching sides.

02:59.213 --> 03:00.312
That's totally irrational.

03:00.314 --> 03:02.347
It's self-preservation.

03:02.349 --> 03:03.682
They think
Valentine can win.

03:04.318 --> 03:06.618
Seelies always want to be
on the winning side.

03:06.620 --> 03:09.354
Never trust a people
who can't lie.

03:09.356 --> 03:10.789
They find much
more inventive ways

03:10.791 --> 03:12.090
to stab you in the back.

03:12.993 --> 03:15.360
[sighing] I suppose you find
that attractive.

03:18.299 --> 03:20.199
[breathing heavily]

03:30.678 --> 03:31.777
You okay?

03:33.147 --> 03:34.413
Hey...

03:37.351 --> 03:38.417
it's me.

03:39.253 --> 03:40.485
I know how much
he means to you.

03:43.224 --> 03:45.324
How could I have doubted him?

03:45.326 --> 03:47.859
Simon, he's... He's the only
father I've ever known.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.895
[stammers] I can't lose him.

03:51.432 --> 03:53.432
I get a good vibe
from this Magnus Bane guy.

03:53.434 --> 03:54.666
He seems like he knows
what he's doing.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.702
The bark will stop
the transformation for now,

03:56.704 --> 03:58.370
but Luke needs an antidote

03:58.372 --> 04:00.038
to stop the poison
in his system.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.107
And I don't have all
the ingredients here.

04:02.109 --> 04:04.009
Just tell me what you need
and how to get it.

04:04.011 --> 04:05.344
No, you stay here.

04:05.346 --> 04:06.778
Luke will need you
if he wakes up.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.080
When he wakes up.

04:08.082 --> 04:09.248
I'll go.
I'll go.

04:09.250 --> 04:12.017
Jace, what happened to you?

04:12.019 --> 04:13.919
Luke's car may
have found its way

04:13.921 --> 04:15.754
into a pole while
I was stashing it.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.389
I don't do mundane driving.

04:17.391 --> 04:18.757
Yeah, apparently.

04:20.461 --> 04:21.360
What do you need
for the antidote?

04:21.362 --> 04:22.461
Hey, I got this.

04:22.463 --> 04:25.697
Phoenix eyes, moon salt,
and Idris fulgurite.

04:25.699 --> 04:27.699
One trip to the pharmacy,
it'll take two seconds.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.234
I know a guy.

04:29.236 --> 04:30.502
And, uh... I don't need him.

04:31.272 --> 04:32.704
Too bad. You're getting me.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.306
We'll be right back.

04:34.308 --> 04:36.275
One more thing.

04:36.277 --> 04:37.609
I need Alexander.

04:38.212 --> 04:39.378
Uh, why do you need Alec?

04:39.947 --> 04:41.380
Virgin Shadowhunter energy.

04:41.382 --> 04:42.914
[scoffs] That
explains so much.

04:42.916 --> 04:45.217
[clears throat] Um,
Alec, yeah...

04:46.086 --> 04:47.319
I can't.

04:47.321 --> 04:48.654
Jace, just ask, please.

04:48.656 --> 04:49.955
You guys need to talk.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.323
[sighs]

04:51.325 --> 04:53.392
Trouble in paradise?

04:55.396 --> 04:57.229
[Jace] Just don't
speak to me.

04:57.665 --> 04:58.730
[sighs]

05:02.836 --> 05:04.569
Mom's in rare form today.

05:04.571 --> 05:06.772
She's been different
since she got back from Idris.

05:06.774 --> 05:08.073
If you say so.

05:08.075 --> 05:09.808
Same old judgmental
Mom with me.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.777
[inhales] Have you
spoken to Jace yet?

05:11.779 --> 05:13.812
He can call me when he's done
chasing the little girl and--

05:13.814 --> 05:15.347
Alec, you need to call Jace.

05:15.349 --> 05:17.349
[Robert] No "welcome home"
for the old man?

05:17.351 --> 05:18.750
[Alec] Max!

05:18.752 --> 05:19.918
[Isabelle] Daddy!

05:21.522 --> 05:22.754
What are you
doing back so soon?

05:22.756 --> 05:24.423
Got in trouble in Mumbai.

05:24.425 --> 05:25.957
Oh, what'd you do?
Nothing.

05:25.959 --> 05:28.327
He started
a fire with his stele
during rune studies.

05:28.329 --> 05:29.928
[chuckles] Max.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.963
I told you, I was hungry.
[Isabelle chuckles]

05:31.965 --> 05:33.932
I was trying to draw
the Nourishment rune.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.967
Those two runes look
nothing alike, Max.

05:35.969 --> 05:37.169
Well, they do to me.

05:37.171 --> 05:38.637
Max, go up to your room,

05:38.639 --> 05:40.939
open the Gray Book
and look up
the Extinguish rune.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.074
[sighs]

05:45.779 --> 05:47.212
[Robert sighs]

05:47.214 --> 05:48.313
Where is Clary Fairchild?

05:48.315 --> 05:49.848
Your mother said
she's missing.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.184
She's not missing.
She's with Jace.

05:52.186 --> 05:53.785
We can't have that girl
out of Institute control.

05:53.787 --> 05:56.321
The entire Shadow World
is looking for her.

05:56.323 --> 05:58.390
It's a security risk.
Get them both back here now.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.193
You need to get back
to the Institute.

06:01.195 --> 06:02.627
You need to
help me first.

06:02.629 --> 06:03.862
No, I'm not messing around.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.130
Me either.

06:05.132 --> 06:06.231
I need your help.

06:06.233 --> 06:07.332
You okay?

06:07.334 --> 06:08.533
<i> I'm fine. It's Magnus.</i>

06:08.535 --> 06:10.836
He needs your powerful
Shadowhunter energy,

06:10.838 --> 06:12.003
or something like that.

06:12.005 --> 06:14.339
Magnus... [stammers]
Why does Magnus need me?

06:14.341 --> 06:16.341
To help save Luke's life.

06:16.343 --> 06:17.709
No, I told you
at the wolf den,

06:17.711 --> 06:19.211
no more Downworlder business.

06:19.213 --> 06:21.480
We can't be
seen as interfering
with a pack alpha dispute.

06:21.482 --> 06:22.681
How can you even ask me--

06:22.683 --> 06:24.416
I shouldn't have
to ask you, Alec.

06:24.418 --> 06:25.517
We're  <i> parabatai.</i>

06:25.519 --> 06:26.551
That's exactly my point.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.420
<i> Alec, you're a man of honor,</i>

06:28.422 --> 06:29.821
and the only
person in the world

06:29.823 --> 06:31.423
I would trust with
something like this.

06:31.425 --> 06:33.825
<i> I'm counting on you</i>
<i> to do the right thing.</i>

06:33.827 --> 06:35.127
[sighs]

06:39.066 --> 06:40.499
What's all this for?

06:40.501 --> 06:42.334
The base for the potion.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.437
[Clary exclaims]

06:45.439 --> 06:47.005
Stir.

06:47.007 --> 06:49.040
We need to have it ready
before your boy toys get back.

06:49.042 --> 06:50.609
What if they don't
get back in time?

06:50.611 --> 06:52.577
You can't think
like that, biscuit.

06:52.579 --> 06:54.479
That's all I can think about.

06:55.282 --> 06:56.448
[scoffs]

06:57.451 --> 06:59.551
Magnus, I don't know
if I can do this anymore.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.052
Okay, I'm an art student.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.621
All my adventures
are supposed to be
two-dimensional.

07:02.623 --> 07:03.755
Who says?

07:03.757 --> 07:05.190
Me.

07:05.192 --> 07:07.626
Look, it is one thing to
draw monsters and demons,

07:07.628 --> 07:11.296
but it is completely
different to see them
up close and personal.

07:11.298 --> 07:12.531
I don't know
what I'm doing.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.433
Don't sell yourself short.

07:14.435 --> 07:15.567
You forget,

07:15.569 --> 07:18.103
I've seen you in action,
Clary Fairchild.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.305
Jocelyn! No, don't... don't...

07:20.307 --> 07:21.473
[stammers] Wait,
don't touch her.

07:21.475 --> 07:22.774
Luke, I'm here.
I'm here. [shushing]

07:22.776 --> 07:23.942
Let me take
your pain away.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.577
[gasping] No. No.

07:25.579 --> 07:27.312
Agitation only makes
the venom work faster.

07:27.314 --> 07:28.447
I need to tell Clary.

07:28.449 --> 07:29.548
Save your strength.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.883
No, you need to know.
No, please.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.452
Magnus, do it.

07:33.921 --> 07:36.555
[groaning] You need
to tell her, all of it.

07:36.557 --> 07:38.490
[grunts] Promise me.

07:38.492 --> 07:39.958
[Luke breathes heavily]

07:41.662 --> 07:43.628
[snaps fingers]
[grunting]

07:46.767 --> 07:47.966
The poison is spreading.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.100
[Luke grunting]

07:49.102 --> 07:51.002
Your suitors
need to hurry.

07:53.340 --> 07:54.957
[Jace] Keep up,
mundane.

07:54.958 --> 07:56.575
[Simon] Would you
stop calling me that?
I have a name.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.477
Well, learning it
would mean I care,
so, no.

07:58.479 --> 08:00.412
Yeah, and God forbid
you care about anyone
but yourself.

08:00.414 --> 08:01.913
I care about
a bunch of people.

08:01.915 --> 08:03.515
Just don't care
about you.

08:03.517 --> 08:05.650
Me, or what...
What's it called, your...
your  <i> parabatais?</i>

08:05.652 --> 08:07.853
Whoa, watch your mouth.

08:08.789 --> 08:10.622
You don't know a thing
about me and Alec.

08:10.624 --> 08:12.157
We clear?

08:12.159 --> 08:14.659
Twenty bucks says
he leaves you
hanging tonight.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.528
Not a chance.
Really?

08:16.530 --> 08:19.464
"Come, fetch, roll over."
You know, "Lie down."

08:19.466 --> 08:20.832
You treat him
like a lap dog.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.501
Guess it takes one
to know one.

08:23.504 --> 08:25.670
What's that
supposed to mean?

08:25.672 --> 08:27.572
It means,

08:27.573 --> 08:29.473
you're like a yippy dog
nipping at Clary's heels.

08:29.476 --> 08:31.610
I don't nip.
And she's my best friend.

08:31.612 --> 08:32.911
That's all she's
ever gonna be.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.348
Have you seriously
not figured that out yet?

08:36.350 --> 08:39.818
Look, I don't want Clary
as anything more
than a best friend.

08:39.820 --> 08:40.952
Right.
And I'll have you know

08:40.954 --> 08:42.854
that there are
tons of women who have

08:42.856 --> 08:44.689
more-than-a-friend
feelings for me.

08:47.528 --> 08:48.894
Where are they?

08:48.896 --> 08:50.529
I don't have to
introduce you to them.

08:50.531 --> 08:53.532
And my point is,
Clary and I have always
had each other's backs.

08:54.535 --> 08:56.201
We had our entire lives.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.136
That's more than I can say
for you or Alec.

08:58.138 --> 09:01.306
You do not get to talk
about Alec, mundane.

09:02.543 --> 09:04.709
I told you,
don't call me mundane!

09:04.711 --> 09:06.745
Are we clear?

09:08.682 --> 09:10.315
[breathing heavily]
What are you gonna do now?

09:11.552 --> 09:12.717
You gonna cut me?

09:14.021 --> 09:15.554
[Simon grunts]

09:15.556 --> 09:18.356
Do that again,
and I'll kick your ass.

09:18.358 --> 09:21.092
[shuddering] I'm sorry.
Dude, I'm sorry.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.261
I don't know
why I did that.

09:23.997 --> 09:25.430
I'm sorry.

09:27.401 --> 09:28.934
What happened to you
at the vampire hotel?

09:28.936 --> 09:30.735
Nothing. I told you,
I was a hostage.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.070
You sure?

09:32.072 --> 09:33.338
Leave me alone!

09:34.207 --> 09:36.107
I told you,
it's nothing, it's...

09:36.109 --> 09:37.342
You just piss me off.

09:45.385 --> 09:46.484
Mother.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.589
What's wrong?

09:50.591 --> 09:51.990
Nothing.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.128
Did something
happen in Idris?

09:57.130 --> 09:58.697
Nothing we can
do about it now.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.433
There's always
something we can do.

10:01.435 --> 10:02.867
You taught me that.

10:09.409 --> 10:10.775
Do you remember
when I was ten?

10:10.777 --> 10:12.210
And there was
that kid, Preston,

10:12.212 --> 10:14.646
who kept beating
the crap out of me
in kendo training?

10:14.648 --> 10:17.082
You had perfect form,
perfect technique.

10:17.084 --> 10:18.950
That was what was
holding me back.

10:19.753 --> 10:22.320
You said I needed to
mess it up, break form,

10:22.322 --> 10:23.888
do something he
wouldn't expect.

10:24.758 --> 10:27.759
It went against every fiber
of my training...

10:27.761 --> 10:28.960
but I adapted.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.863
I was so proud when
you broke his nose.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.734
Until his mother
yelled at you,

10:35.736 --> 10:38.303
and insisted I be punished
for insubordination.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.139
That just made me prouder.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.774
The way you took it.

10:42.776 --> 10:44.242
I knew it had
to be done.

10:45.445 --> 10:46.778
We can figure out
a work-around

10:46.780 --> 10:48.747
for whatever the Clave
is throwing at you.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.851
Work-arounds can get messy,
if you recall.

10:57.357 --> 10:58.590
We're Lightwoods.

10:58.592 --> 11:01.826
We break noses
and accept the consequences.

11:04.131 --> 11:05.897
Tell me what
you need me to do.

11:10.337 --> 11:11.736
Tell me what?

11:12.539 --> 11:14.706
What's so important
that Luke risked his life?

11:14.708 --> 11:17.342
Everything Jocelyn
hoped to hide from you.

11:21.848 --> 11:22.681
Why?

11:23.984 --> 11:27.752
[sighs] When you were younger,
I'd watch you sketching.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.088
It was your bliss.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.059
You're gonna need
some bliss now.

11:34.061 --> 11:36.127
Back then, there wasn't a day
I didn't draw.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.830
It was like breathing.

11:38.832 --> 11:40.065
Now, I look at
this blank page

11:40.067 --> 11:41.966
and I barely even
know what to do.

11:45.539 --> 11:49.607
Sometimes I feel like my art,
my memories...

11:50.544 --> 11:51.876
My life, it...

11:51.878 --> 11:54.079
it all vanished
with that Memory Demon.

11:54.881 --> 11:57.816
Your art,
everything you are...

11:58.885 --> 12:00.318
they're all still here.

12:01.855 --> 12:04.322
You're the woman
your mother always
knew you could be.

12:05.192 --> 12:08.159
But tried to keep me
from being.

12:08.161 --> 12:10.261
That's why you need to
know how you got here.

12:12.733 --> 12:14.265
Will it help me
find my mother?

12:15.836 --> 12:17.335
That's the only reason
I can think of

12:17.337 --> 12:18.903
why Luke would
be so adamant.

12:18.905 --> 12:19.971
[sighs]

12:20.907 --> 12:22.340
I'm ready.

12:23.610 --> 12:25.143
Bring it, warlock.

12:26.613 --> 12:28.613
[Magnus] When I first heard
about your father,

12:28.615 --> 12:31.916
around the time
he and Jocelyn
first got together,

12:31.918 --> 12:34.886
long before the Uprising
and the Circle,

12:34.888 --> 12:38.256
Valentine elevated
the Morgenstern name
to be synonymous with virtue.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.792
Defenders of the Accords,
allies to the Downworld.

12:40.794 --> 12:42.260
This is who we are!

12:42.262 --> 12:43.862
[Magnus]  <i> And your</i>
<i> mother was at his side.</i>

12:43.864 --> 12:45.964
We must never
violate our oath.

12:45.966 --> 12:48.867
Because this is
our sacred duty.

12:50.937 --> 12:53.304
[Magnus]  <i> But by the time</i>
<i>my people came to know him,</i>

12:53.306 --> 12:54.839
<i> barely two years later...</i>

12:55.575 --> 12:57.876
his name had become
synonymous with devastation.

12:59.379 --> 13:01.679
<i> Your mother</i>
<i> told me it was then</i>
<i> she first saw the signs.</i>

13:02.916 --> 13:04.215
Val...

13:05.252 --> 13:06.951
Are you hurt?

13:07.254 --> 13:08.953
Talk to me.
Whose blood is this?

13:08.955 --> 13:10.255
Warlocks.

13:10.257 --> 13:12.056
They attacked you?
Where? When?

13:14.227 --> 13:15.693
You've broken
the Accords.

13:19.399 --> 13:20.598
I'll talk to my father.

13:20.600 --> 13:21.800
He knows the Law
better than anyone.

13:21.802 --> 13:24.002
Sometimes it isn't clear
who instigated the fight.

13:24.004 --> 13:25.603
The Accords are a fallacy.

13:25.605 --> 13:26.905
Everything about them,

13:26.907 --> 13:28.306
down to the
blasphemous magic

13:28.308 --> 13:30.175
that binds us all
to their stupidity.

13:30.177 --> 13:32.010
The Accords guarantee peace.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.111
We are Shadowhunters.

13:33.113 --> 13:34.612
We don't make
peace with demons.

13:34.614 --> 13:36.481
Downworlders
are half human.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.883
And half demon!
Shadowhunters kill demons.

13:39.653 --> 13:40.985
I'm fulfilling our destiny.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.823
[Magnus] They never
found all the bodies.

13:44.825 --> 13:47.258
We'd all stood
with the Clave
for centuries.

13:47.260 --> 13:49.160
How could that
not matter to him?

13:49.162 --> 13:51.830
He was obsessed with
ensuring purity of blood.

13:52.866 --> 13:55.200
Convinced that the impurities
were a threat to peace.

13:55.202 --> 13:57.001
He was the threat to peace.

13:57.003 --> 13:58.736
Mad men rarely
make sense.

13:59.606 --> 14:00.939
Mostly, they just hate.

14:00.941 --> 14:02.340
And he hated
the Downworlders,

14:02.342 --> 14:05.109
for the gifts that we possess
that he could not have.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.279
He hated us enough
to kill us all.

14:09.783 --> 14:11.482
[Maryse] It's not
like Isabelle can do it.

14:11.484 --> 14:12.650
[Robert] You're
too hard on her.

14:12.652 --> 14:14.118
And you're too
soft on her.

14:14.120 --> 14:16.521
It has to be Alec.
He'll adapt.

14:16.857 --> 14:18.022
Adapt to what?

14:18.024 --> 14:19.691
It's not your concern.

14:19.693 --> 14:22.026
Maryse, this is
a family decision.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.628
This is our only option.

14:23.630 --> 14:24.963
Get on board, Robert!

14:25.966 --> 14:27.699
She's been like
that all day.

14:27.701 --> 14:29.200
[sighs]
What's going on?

14:32.539 --> 14:33.771
[laughs softly]

14:36.076 --> 14:37.075
You know, ever since
you were little,

14:37.077 --> 14:38.877
this has been my favorite part
of coming home.

14:38.879 --> 14:40.078
Why?

14:40.080 --> 14:41.045
Just to see your
face like that.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.146
[laughs]

14:46.219 --> 14:48.486
You trying to
tell me something?

14:48.488 --> 14:49.954
No, not at all.

14:51.324 --> 14:52.690
You're perfect.

14:52.692 --> 14:53.758
[chuckles]

14:55.862 --> 14:57.095
I love it.

14:58.899 --> 15:01.132
But I'm still gonna ask you
what that was about.

15:02.535 --> 15:04.836
If the Seelies
change sides,

15:04.838 --> 15:06.738
we have no hope of
defeating Valentine.

15:06.740 --> 15:08.339
There has to be
something we can do.

15:08.341 --> 15:10.341
You know the Seelies
better than anyone.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.544
I'm not judging you.

15:13.546 --> 15:16.180
It's a fact.
It's an asset.

15:16.182 --> 15:19.284
You and I need to convince
the Clave of what's coming.

15:20.520 --> 15:21.619
But...

15:23.089 --> 15:24.389
after all the
unsanctioned missions

15:24.391 --> 15:26.190
that your brother authorized
while we were away...

15:26.192 --> 15:28.026
Alec was protecting Clary.

15:28.028 --> 15:30.161
We all were.
That's what the
Clave wanted.

15:30.797 --> 15:32.030
You went rogue.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.800
And now the Clave thinks
our family honor
is beyond repair.

15:35.802 --> 15:37.268
The Lightwood name
only has meaning

15:37.270 --> 15:39.470
because of all
the people who have
fought for our cause,

15:39.472 --> 15:41.906
we were among
the bravest.

15:41.908 --> 15:43.808
The best of the
Shadowhunters.

15:43.810 --> 15:45.843
And now they think
we're not anymore.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.448
We'll do better.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.716
Jace, Alec, and I,

15:51.718 --> 15:53.718
we'll restore
the family name
and our honor.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.586
Then you need
to understand

15:55.588 --> 15:57.155
the honor comes from the deed.

15:57.157 --> 15:59.924
It's not a simple proposition
to restore it.

15:59.926 --> 16:02.660
It's gonna require
a tremendous sacrifice.

16:06.833 --> 16:08.566
Ever since my mother
was kidnapped,

16:08.568 --> 16:10.435
and the Shadow
World invaded my life,

16:10.437 --> 16:12.170
so many Downworlders
have helped me,

16:12.172 --> 16:14.639
not even thinking about
what it might cost them.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.574
How could Valentine
not see good in any of them?

16:16.576 --> 16:18.643
He was blinded
by his ambition.

16:19.012 --> 16:20.912
Why didn't the
Clave stop him?

16:20.914 --> 16:22.814
[sighs] He was clever.

16:22.816 --> 16:25.350
He and his followers,
they managed to
convince the Clave

16:25.352 --> 16:28.119
that the Downworlders
they killed on their
special missions

16:28.121 --> 16:30.254
had violated the
Accords in some way.

16:30.256 --> 16:32.256
Complete fabrications.

16:32.258 --> 16:33.725
How could the
Clave not see?

16:35.996 --> 16:38.429
Shadowhunters
believe in the Law
as absolute.

16:38.431 --> 16:41.132
They could never
conceive of one of
their own going astray.

16:41.134 --> 16:42.266
[laughs]

16:42.268 --> 16:44.335
My father didn't
go astray, Magnus.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.170
He went insane.

16:46.539 --> 16:49.874
What happened back then
is happening again.

16:49.876 --> 16:52.343
The Clave refuses to believe
that Valentine's a threat.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.179
Nineteen years ago,

16:55.181 --> 16:56.614
their lack of vision
allowed the Circle

16:56.616 --> 16:59.217
to almost decimate
the entire Shadow World.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.719
That was the Uprising?
Yes.

17:01.721 --> 17:05.289
Valentine wanted to create
a new Shadowhunter army.

17:06.960 --> 17:10.194
<i> And for that,</i>
<i> he needed the Mortal Cup.</i>

17:10.196 --> 17:13.231
<i>He knew it would be on display</i>
<i>at the signing of the Accords</i>

17:13.233 --> 17:15.066
<i> as a show of</i>
<i> the Clave's power.</i>

17:15.068 --> 17:16.267
[blades clanging]
[grunting]

17:24.244 --> 17:25.943
[groans]

17:31.251 --> 17:32.750
[both grunting]

17:39.392 --> 17:41.075
[Magnus]  <i> He seized</i>
<i> the opportunity</i>

17:41.076 --> 17:42.759
<i> to accomplish everything</i>
<i> he ever wanted.</i>

17:44.564 --> 17:49.500
<i> Destroy the Accords,</i>
<i> murder Downworlders,</i>
<i> and secure the Cup.</i>

17:50.270 --> 17:51.502
[electricity crackling]

18:14.260 --> 18:17.728
How could my mom
and Luke be a part of
something like this?

18:17.730 --> 18:20.431
Jocelyn and Luke
tried to prevent
the Uprising.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.867
They tried to
change Valentine's mind
about Downworlders.

18:22.869 --> 18:25.269
Obviously, they didn't.

18:25.271 --> 18:27.472
Clary, if it wasn't for
your mother and Luke,

18:27.474 --> 18:29.040
the Circle would have won.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.382
[grunts]

18:41.121 --> 18:42.787
[both grunting]

18:59.572 --> 19:00.972
[grunting]

19:07.180 --> 19:08.679
[blade ringing]

19:14.154 --> 19:15.419
[yelling] No!

19:17.323 --> 19:19.090
[groans]

19:25.131 --> 19:26.230
[groans]

19:27.367 --> 19:28.699
[blade ringing]

19:37.844 --> 19:39.577
[panting]

19:45.618 --> 19:48.519
Ever since I found out
Valentine was my father,

19:48.521 --> 19:51.689
I wondered how my mother
could be married to
someone like that...

19:51.691 --> 19:53.191
and why she stayed.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.326
She had to stop him.

19:55.328 --> 19:57.228
And safeguard the Cup.

19:57.897 --> 19:59.297
Everything Jocelyn did,

19:59.299 --> 20:01.399
she did to save the people
she'd sworn to protect.

20:01.401 --> 20:03.734
She took her oath as
a Shadowhunter seriously.

20:03.736 --> 20:06.304
I understand,
but how does that
help me find the Cup?

20:06.306 --> 20:07.638
Maybe Luke thinks

20:07.640 --> 20:09.640
if you know
your mother better,

20:09.642 --> 20:11.042
you'll know
where she hid it.

20:11.044 --> 20:13.277
Then, tell me why she gave up
being a Shadowhunter.

20:14.047 --> 20:16.881
Because the one
thing in the world
she loved more is you.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.383
She had to protect you.

20:21.354 --> 20:24.422
[sighs] From my father,
the lunatic.

20:25.358 --> 20:27.425
[Luke grunting]
Luke.

20:28.328 --> 20:30.228
Luke?
The magic's wearing off.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.897
It was our fault.
It was our fault!

20:32.899 --> 20:34.765
[groaning loudly]
Luke!

20:34.767 --> 20:36.400
[gasps] It's worse.

20:45.445 --> 20:46.877
Promise me you won't
go through with it.

20:46.879 --> 20:48.512
Promise me
you'll say no.

20:48.514 --> 20:50.214
What are you talking about?
Say no to what?

20:50.216 --> 20:51.749
They're gonna
make you marry.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.718
[scoffs] Who's they?

20:53.720 --> 20:56.420
Our parents are making
plans for both of us.

20:56.422 --> 20:58.422
No, you heard wrong.

20:58.691 --> 20:59.890
[grunting]

20:59.892 --> 21:01.392
It's true, Alec.

21:01.394 --> 21:03.094
They need a political
alliance quickly

21:03.096 --> 21:05.129
to restore our
family name and our
influence at the Clave.

21:05.131 --> 21:06.464
[scoffs]

21:07.267 --> 21:09.500
I knew Clary Fray
would come back to
bite me in the ass.

21:11.104 --> 21:13.404
So wait,
when I'm getting married,
what are you doing?

21:13.406 --> 21:16.474
They need me to convince
the Clave to placate
the Seelies somehow.

21:17.277 --> 21:19.710
You're playing the
diplomat? Again?

21:19.712 --> 21:21.612
That's my job.
That's what I'm
supposed to be doing!

21:21.614 --> 21:24.315
I know that.
But I'm the one with
ties to the Seelies.

21:24.884 --> 21:26.050
[scoffs]

21:26.653 --> 21:28.319
Is that what you're
calling it now?

21:28.321 --> 21:30.021
Alec, I'm on your side.

21:31.090 --> 21:32.290
Really?

21:33.293 --> 21:35.493
I have followed every rule.

21:36.429 --> 21:37.628
I've given up everything!

21:37.630 --> 21:39.030
We'll find a
way out of this.

21:44.904 --> 21:46.971
[scoffs] Screw the rules.

21:48.308 --> 21:50.641
Screw them.
Screw all of this.

21:52.912 --> 21:54.145
Alec.

21:58.618 --> 22:00.318
So is this where
you kill me

22:00.320 --> 22:01.819
and dispose of the
body in some ditch

22:01.821 --> 22:03.354
where no one will find me?
Tell me again.

22:03.356 --> 22:04.588
What does Clary
see in you?

22:04.590 --> 22:05.956
My inner compassion.

22:05.958 --> 22:07.625
Something you're
sorely lacking.

22:07.627 --> 22:09.126
You don't really
need compassion

22:09.128 --> 22:10.928
when you can get by on
charm and good looks.

22:10.930 --> 22:12.530
And you wonder
what she sees in me.

22:16.135 --> 22:17.435
What are we doing here?

22:17.837 --> 22:20.471
My black market dealer
operates out of this building.

22:20.473 --> 22:22.440
Cozy. Downworlder,
I'm assuming?

22:23.176 --> 22:24.375
Hates mundanes.

22:24.377 --> 22:26.177
So you guys have
something in common.

22:26.179 --> 22:28.546
Just, uh... hang back.

22:30.283 --> 22:32.316
I told Clary
I'd get her what she
needs to save Luke.

22:32.318 --> 22:35.219
I am not hanging back
like some third wheel.

22:35.221 --> 22:36.787
You are a third wheel.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.225
And I wasn't asking.

22:45.965 --> 22:47.531
[faint fluttering]

22:48.501 --> 22:50.368
[clattering]

22:50.370 --> 22:51.602
Camille?

22:54.307 --> 22:55.439
[gasps]

23:04.751 --> 23:06.217
[Jace] Run!

23:06.219 --> 23:07.952
[grunts]

23:08.488 --> 23:09.553
Come on, mundane.

23:09.555 --> 23:11.922
Clary will not be
happy if I let you die.

23:11.924 --> 23:13.557
[snarling]

23:13.559 --> 23:14.792
[grunts]

23:17.563 --> 23:18.629
[rumbling]

23:19.599 --> 23:21.732
[Luke groaning]
I'm running out of magic.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.234
[Clary] What do I do?

23:23.236 --> 23:25.436
I can't leave him,
but the potion stock

23:25.438 --> 23:27.004
still needs Komodo scale.

23:27.006 --> 23:29.106
Find it, add the rest
when they get here.

23:29.108 --> 23:30.408
You'll have to
feed it to Luke.

23:30.410 --> 23:31.609
What about you?

23:31.611 --> 23:33.310
I'll hold on
as long as I can.

23:34.514 --> 23:35.579
Go!
[grunting]

23:40.186 --> 23:41.485
[Luke groaning]

23:44.557 --> 23:46.957
[panting] Help me.

23:48.561 --> 23:50.094
I need your strength.

23:53.433 --> 23:54.465
Take what you need.

24:02.575 --> 24:04.675
[Luke grunting loudly]

24:08.214 --> 24:09.747
[rumbling continues]
[both] Clary!

24:09.749 --> 24:11.882
[Clary] Do you have it?
Yeah.

24:11.884 --> 24:13.551
[panting] Thanks.

24:15.588 --> 24:17.288
[groans]

24:37.677 --> 24:38.676
[rumbling stops]

24:38.678 --> 24:39.910
[sighs]

24:41.347 --> 24:42.680
[Clary laughs softly]

24:42.682 --> 24:44.715
[softly] Hey... Clary.

24:47.653 --> 24:49.620
[breathing heavily]
You okay?

24:49.622 --> 24:50.521
Yeah.

24:51.691 --> 24:52.756
It's just like
your father,

24:52.758 --> 24:54.658
trying to undermine
me through you.

24:54.660 --> 24:56.327
What's going on
between you and Dad?

24:56.329 --> 24:57.595
You think I can't
pick up on it?

24:57.597 --> 24:58.996
Keep your voice down!

24:58.998 --> 25:01.665
This is not about
me and your father.
It's about Alec.

25:01.667 --> 25:03.234
And I'll do anything
to protect him.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.636
Well, you can't do this.

25:05.638 --> 25:07.771
You and your Downworlders
have seen to that.

25:08.474 --> 25:10.541
You can't possibly attract
the caliber of husband

25:10.543 --> 25:13.177
who could help us restore
the honor to our family name.

25:13.179 --> 25:14.512
The honor comes
from the deed.

25:14.514 --> 25:16.146
When you truly
understand that,

25:16.148 --> 25:17.648
then you'll understand me.

25:17.650 --> 25:19.183
You're talking
politics.

25:19.185 --> 25:21.018
I'm talking about
Alec's life.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.220
It's all the same
to a Shadowhunter, Isabelle.

25:23.222 --> 25:24.655
How can we
protect others

25:24.657 --> 25:26.457
when we can't protect
our own family?

25:26.459 --> 25:28.726
Alec gets that...

25:28.728 --> 25:29.860
unlike you.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.428
[inhales sharply]

25:33.833 --> 25:35.099
[huffs]

25:36.669 --> 25:38.569
[sighs deeply]

25:50.349 --> 25:51.549
Alec, wait.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.086
If you hadn't
gotten here in time, I...

25:58.591 --> 26:01.525
I'm just...
I'm glad you and
Jace are okay now.

26:02.562 --> 26:04.495
I didn't do this for Jace.

26:06.532 --> 26:08.265
Then I'm glad
you did it for you.

26:18.611 --> 26:20.010
[Jace] Thank you.

26:24.417 --> 26:27.618
You have an interesting effect
on people, Clary Fray.

26:27.620 --> 26:29.153
He helped save Luke's life.

26:29.789 --> 26:31.188
You all did.

26:31.190 --> 26:32.656
Thank you.

26:33.125 --> 26:34.758
For what?
For running an errand?

26:34.760 --> 26:36.627
For having my back.

26:40.032 --> 26:42.166
I'm always gonna
have your back.

26:43.135 --> 26:44.268
[laughs softly]

26:49.408 --> 26:50.608
Clary...

26:53.212 --> 26:54.378
Luke's asking for you.

26:54.914 --> 26:56.347
Yeah. Right.
[chuckles]

26:59.819 --> 27:01.485
Thank you... so much.

27:10.229 --> 27:12.363
Tell Clary I've
got something to do.

27:13.232 --> 27:14.331
Simon.

27:15.968 --> 27:17.534
[sighs]

27:26.779 --> 27:27.711
It's cool.

27:34.820 --> 27:36.153
Speed.

27:38.024 --> 27:39.256
Courage in Combat.

27:40.993 --> 27:42.693
Nourishment.

27:42.695 --> 27:45.996
Max... you know
this is the Heat rune.

27:45.998 --> 27:47.631
Oh, right.

27:47.633 --> 27:50.567
Come here, you little devil.
I'm gonna get you. [laughing]

27:54.373 --> 27:56.206
Max, could we
have a moment?

27:56.208 --> 27:58.676
I never get to
hear the good stuff.

27:58.678 --> 28:00.044
[Isabelle sighs]

28:05.217 --> 28:07.184
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean
to be so harsh.

28:08.521 --> 28:09.687
I'm used to it by now.

28:09.689 --> 28:11.555
I wish you could understand
how difficult it is

28:11.557 --> 28:13.057
to be your own
childrens' commander.

28:13.059 --> 28:15.492
You've made your
priorities pretty clear.

28:15.494 --> 28:16.794
In times of war--

28:16.796 --> 28:17.728
We're always at war, Mom.

28:19.298 --> 28:21.365
So spare me your
parenting excuses.

28:21.367 --> 28:23.701
Isabelle, I'm trying
to protect all of us.

28:23.703 --> 28:25.235
I'm trying to protect you.

28:25.237 --> 28:28.439
And how exactly does
what you're doing
to Alec protect me?

28:30.543 --> 28:33.243
[chuckles]
You remind me
so much of me.

28:33.245 --> 28:35.846
If that were true,
I would actually be impressed.

28:35.848 --> 28:37.514
Trust me, you wouldn't.

28:37.516 --> 28:38.916
When I was your age,
I thought I had
everything figured out.

28:38.918 --> 28:41.885
I thought I could
change the world
by breaking the rules.

28:42.888 --> 28:44.888
You broke the rules?
[scoffs]

28:44.890 --> 28:46.690
Where did that person go?

28:46.692 --> 28:49.927
She was stupid.
She confused passion
with strength.

28:49.929 --> 28:51.895
So passion makes you weak?
No.

28:51.897 --> 28:54.898
Passion makes you dangerous.

28:54.900 --> 28:57.735
That's why you're not ready
for the responsibility
you think you are.

29:10.082 --> 29:11.915
Thank you, Magnus.

29:11.917 --> 29:12.983
You're welcome.

29:17.523 --> 29:19.356
I'll leave you two alone.

29:19.358 --> 29:20.924
[Luke clears throat]

29:25.931 --> 29:27.431
Go easy on him.

29:28.934 --> 29:30.434
[clears throat]

29:32.938 --> 29:35.005
You know you can't
avoid the question, right?

29:36.909 --> 29:38.942
I know Mom swore
you to secrecy,

29:38.944 --> 29:40.611
but I've seen you
stand up to her before.

29:40.613 --> 29:42.412
Why didn't you tell me
about any of this?

29:42.414 --> 29:43.981
Because I was afraid
you'd hate us.

29:43.983 --> 29:45.282
Not possible.

29:46.585 --> 29:48.952
Okay... the last few days,

29:48.954 --> 29:50.954
I have not had all
of the information.

29:50.956 --> 29:52.122
And you still don't.

29:52.124 --> 29:53.891
But you need to
know everything.

29:53.893 --> 29:56.326
It'll help you
find the Mortal Cup.

29:56.328 --> 29:57.461
How?

29:57.463 --> 29:58.896
You're just gonna
have to trust me.

29:59.398 --> 30:01.698
I do, more than anything.

30:03.435 --> 30:05.903
Nothing you say is
ever gonna change that.

30:05.905 --> 30:08.138
Okay, but you have
to trust me, too.

30:09.608 --> 30:10.874
All right.

30:13.779 --> 30:15.412
Magnus told you
about the Uprising?

30:15.414 --> 30:16.947
Yeah.

30:16.949 --> 30:19.383
About the Valentine
who murdered
all those people?

30:20.352 --> 30:21.652
Yes.

30:21.654 --> 30:24.988
The reason he
became that man
was our fault...

30:26.826 --> 30:28.525
mine and Jocelyn's.

30:29.595 --> 30:30.794
I don't believe you.

30:30.796 --> 30:32.663
We betrayed him, Clary...

30:32.665 --> 30:33.931
your mother and I.

30:37.303 --> 30:38.735
We fell in love.

30:41.941 --> 30:42.840
Did you...

30:45.377 --> 30:46.844
[stammers] Wait...

30:47.847 --> 30:49.947
Are you my...
No.

30:49.949 --> 30:51.148
No, we never...

30:51.150 --> 30:52.282
Slept together?

30:52.284 --> 30:53.951
Yeah. I mean, no!

30:53.953 --> 30:56.119
Your parents
were married.
[scoffs]

30:56.121 --> 30:58.055
Valentine was
my  <i> parabatai.</i>

30:58.891 --> 31:00.557
We both loved him.

31:01.126 --> 31:03.060
But as his rhetoric
got more violent...

31:03.062 --> 31:06.630
and he became more combative
with the Clave... [sighs]

31:06.632 --> 31:07.865
we started to worry.

31:08.734 --> 31:12.236
We tried to help him,
tried to temper him, but...

31:12.238 --> 31:14.071
he just kept pulling away.

31:16.141 --> 31:17.908
That just drew us
closer together.

31:19.011 --> 31:23.080
We knew it was wrong,
but we couldn't
deny it, or hide it.

31:24.016 --> 31:25.515
[young Jocelyn] He's
angry all the time.

31:25.517 --> 31:28.385
[voice breaking]
If only the Clave
would listen to reason.

31:30.589 --> 31:32.890
We have to make
Val listen to reason.

31:35.995 --> 31:39.730
[Luke]  <i> Valentine</i>
<i> became convinced</i>
<i> we were having an affair.</i>

31:40.566 --> 31:43.233
<i>He was obsessed with winning</i>
<i> Jocelyn's heart back.</i>

31:46.071 --> 31:49.106
<i> For love, he was</i>
<i> willing to do anything...</i>

31:49.108 --> 31:51.875
<i> even compromise</i>
<i> his own principles.</i>

31:51.877 --> 31:54.611
<i>He became fixated on becoming</i>
<i> a better soldier.</i>

31:55.381 --> 31:57.347
<i> That led him to do</i>
<i> the unthinkable...</i>

31:57.349 --> 32:00.017
<i> experiment with</i>
<i> Downworlder blood.</i>

32:02.554 --> 32:05.122
[grunting]

32:05.124 --> 32:06.690
[yells]

32:06.692 --> 32:08.125
[gasps] Val!

32:09.695 --> 32:12.029
Val! Hey! Hey!

32:12.031 --> 32:13.697
Val, come on.

32:13.699 --> 32:16.633
[Luke]  <i> Once he</i>
<i> crossed that line...</i>

32:16.635 --> 32:18.302
<i> we never got him back again.</i>

32:20.973 --> 32:22.072
[Luke] In the end,

32:22.074 --> 32:24.574
our love did more
damage to Valentine

32:24.576 --> 32:25.976
than anything anybody else
could have done.

32:28.747 --> 32:29.913
We broke his heart.

32:29.915 --> 32:31.315
At least now I know
he had one...

32:32.117 --> 32:35.052
before his crazy,
distorted world view set in.

32:35.888 --> 32:36.954
[young Jocelyn grunts]

32:45.931 --> 32:48.732
Sometimes you
have to take matters
into your own hands.

32:51.303 --> 32:52.936
[Clary] What was
he like back then?

32:52.938 --> 32:54.838
Before he, you know...

32:54.840 --> 32:56.373
In the early days
of the Circle?

32:58.177 --> 33:01.111
Oh... he was honorable.

33:01.113 --> 33:02.679
Idealistic.

33:03.615 --> 33:05.749
He was charismatic.

33:06.685 --> 33:10.153
Just Mom's type.
Just like you.

33:10.155 --> 33:11.621
Oh, no. No.

33:11.623 --> 33:14.057
I never came close.
He was a leader.

33:15.627 --> 33:17.995
Devoted to protecting us
from dying pointless deaths.

33:17.997 --> 33:20.130
And you believed in him.

33:20.132 --> 33:22.299
If Simon told you
he had the cure for cancer,

33:22.301 --> 33:24.034
you'd want to
believe him, too.

33:24.036 --> 33:26.336
Well, I'd probably
give him the benefit
of the doubt at least.

33:26.338 --> 33:29.539
Which is what I did.
What we all did.

33:29.541 --> 33:30.974
The demons were winning.

33:30.976 --> 33:33.777
We couldn't train our people
fast enough to keep up.

33:33.779 --> 33:35.812
Val wanted the Clave
to use the Mortal Cup

33:35.814 --> 33:37.180
to create more Shadowhunters,

33:37.182 --> 33:38.115
but that just made them angry.

33:38.117 --> 33:40.517
Isn't more Shadowhunters
a good thing?

33:40.519 --> 33:41.985
Not the way
he was proposing.

33:41.987 --> 33:43.620
Ever since the Angel
Raziel created

33:43.622 --> 33:46.123
the first Shadowhunters
with the Cup,

33:46.125 --> 33:47.791
it's been forbidden
to use the Cup again

33:47.793 --> 33:49.259
to rebuild their forces.

33:52.164 --> 33:54.131
Jocelyn and I,
we tried pulling him back,

33:54.133 --> 33:56.199
but he just
misconstrued that as...

33:56.201 --> 33:57.768
[Clary] The affair.

33:59.138 --> 34:00.737
It's not your fault, Luke.

34:00.739 --> 34:03.407
There's no way you two could
have pushed him over the edge.

34:04.476 --> 34:05.942
He did that to himself...

34:05.944 --> 34:07.744
with the blood injections.

34:07.746 --> 34:09.413
And the more
injections he took,

34:09.415 --> 34:11.948
the deeper it seemed
he descended into madness.

34:12.551 --> 34:13.650
Val--

34:13.652 --> 34:15.085
Those things
continue to multiply,

34:15.087 --> 34:18.221
while we sacrifice ourselves
to protect the mundanes.

34:18.223 --> 34:21.191
The Clave is content to
operate with blinders on,
but I'm not!

34:21.193 --> 34:23.260
I'm the only one
who sees the truth!

34:24.363 --> 34:25.595
Magnus never
told me that part.

34:25.597 --> 34:27.064
He didn't know.

34:27.066 --> 34:28.865
There are some
things Joce and I
never talked about.

34:28.867 --> 34:30.767
Why would she hide
that she's an artist...

34:30.769 --> 34:32.936
especially from me?

34:32.937 --> 34:35.104
Because after that night,
she locked that part
of herself away.

34:35.107 --> 34:37.507
She never wanted
their lives to affect you.

34:37.509 --> 34:39.342
What did my father do?

34:44.283 --> 34:46.950
Your mother is
the only other person
I ever told this to.

34:46.952 --> 34:48.885
I never wanted
it to burden you.

34:48.887 --> 34:50.087
Tell me.

34:51.256 --> 34:53.623
Valentine asked me
to back him up on a mission.

34:56.095 --> 34:58.028
<i> Some farmers</i>
<i> had gone missing.</i>

34:59.064 --> 35:00.297
<i> He said it was</i>
<i> werewolves.</i>

[wolves growling]

35:18.117 --> 35:20.117

<i> our  </i> parabatai  <i> bond. </i>

35:21.153 --> 35:22.853
[young Luke screams]

35:22.854 --> 35:24.554
And then he betrayed
everything else
he believed in.

35:28.660 --> 35:30.427
Why aren't you dead?

35:30.429 --> 35:31.795
Because I'm a Shadowhunter.

35:36.635 --> 35:38.235
You're an abomination.

35:44.276 --> 35:45.976
[blade ringing]

35:50.115 --> 35:51.481
[Luke growling]

35:51.483 --> 35:52.849
You should have
killed yourself.

35:52.851 --> 35:54.084
[young Jocelyn yelling] No!

35:54.353 --> 35:55.352
[groans]

35:58.757 --> 35:59.890

36:02.294 --> 36:04.161

[young Valentine grunts]

36:20.546 --> 36:21.778
[groans]

36:21.780 --> 36:24.681
For a while,
I thought he'd killed her.

36:26.185 --> 36:27.884
He wanted us both dead.

36:27.886 --> 36:29.719
He killed thousands.

36:29.721 --> 36:32.355
Turned Shadowhunter
against Shadowhunter.

36:33.292 --> 36:35.025
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

36:35.027 --> 36:37.394
God only knows what
he'd do if he got the Cup.

36:45.504 --> 36:48.138
We have to get the Cup
before Valentine does.

36:48.140 --> 36:49.206
But I don't know
where it is.

36:49.208 --> 36:51.174
[stammers] Or even
where to start looking.

36:51.176 --> 36:53.743
It all starts
and ends with you.

36:53.745 --> 36:55.045
How do you know that?

36:55.047 --> 36:56.213
Because I know Jocelyn.

36:58.083 --> 37:01.318
You're the only other person
she would have trusted with
the location of the Cup.

37:01.320 --> 37:02.552
If she trusted me so much,

37:02.554 --> 37:04.354
why didn't she
tell me any of this?

37:04.356 --> 37:06.056
She didn't think
this was gonna happen.

37:06.058 --> 37:07.657
She made provisions
just in case it did.

37:07.659 --> 37:09.226
The potion, Dot...

37:09.228 --> 37:12.429
Jocelyn said that
I should tell you
everything about our past.

37:12.431 --> 37:14.231
That it would unlock you.
What does that even mean?

37:14.233 --> 37:16.866
I don't know!
But you do.

37:16.868 --> 37:18.435
