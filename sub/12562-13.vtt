Previously on <i>Royal Pains...</i>

00:07.505 --> 00:08.671
When are you going back to Uruguay?

00:08.673 --> 00:10.473
I am going to tell the hospital tomorrow

00:10.475 --> 00:13.209
and help them find and train
a replacement.

00:13.211 --> 00:15.678
My parents feel entitled to restitution.

00:15.680 --> 00:17.380
My parents cut me off, Raj.

00:17.382 --> 00:19.615
I can't even afford the gratuity on this.

00:19.617 --> 00:21.017
Next date, no helmets.

00:21.019 --> 00:22.551
There's not going to be a next date.

00:22.553 --> 00:24.553
I have a fully fleshed-out business plan.

00:24.555 --> 00:26.522
Is this about you wanting
a bigger business?

00:26.524 --> 00:27.857
Or is this about you wanting

00:27.859 --> 00:29.859
to make this a bigger business for Paige?

00:29.861 --> 00:33.029
The anti-DNA test came back
positive for lupus.

00:33.031 --> 00:35.531
In your profession,
positive is a negative.

00:35.533 --> 00:37.266
Jack, we can fight this together.

00:37.268 --> 00:39.635
Okay, well, we'll fight it
together later.

00:39.637 --> 00:41.537
I've got a lesson.

00:41.539 --> 00:43.205
Jack's proteins are plus-three.

00:43.207 --> 00:45.641
His lupus is more advanced
than we thought.

00:45.643 --> 00:48.077
It's attacking his kidneys.

01:57.915 --> 02:00.316
Oh.

02:00.318 --> 02:02.118
At this time,

02:02.120 --> 02:04.053
I would like to ask the immediate family

02:04.055 --> 02:07.056
and close friends to please come forward

02:07.058 --> 02:09.258
to join in the blessing

02:09.259 --> 02:13.896
known as true loving kindness.

02:13.898 --> 02:15.631
Thank you.

02:15.633 --> 02:18.234
This demonstrates our continuing concern

02:18.236 --> 02:19.502
for the deceased

02:19.504 --> 02:22.671
as we assure their final journey
will be complete.

02:49.467 --> 02:52.635
You shouldn't be working
with your bad back.

02:52.637 --> 02:55.438
Aye. Aye-yi-yi.

02:57.674 --> 02:59.875
- So, Henry...
- Yeah?

02:59.877 --> 03:02.244
If you move any slower,

03:02.246 --> 03:03.479
some people are gonna show up

03:03.481 --> 03:05.481
and they're gonna start
harvesting your organs.

03:05.483 --> 03:06.482
Okay, you don't have to be here.

03:06.484 --> 03:07.817
Why are you here?

03:07.819 --> 03:09.485
Because I'm trying to get you to realize

03:09.487 --> 03:10.753
that we have a very busy schedule

03:10.755 --> 03:12.088
for the next few days,

03:12.090 --> 03:14.690
and Divya alone can't cover
all of our patients.

03:14.692 --> 03:16.192
I'm fine, okay? I'm fine.

03:16.194 --> 03:17.193
- You're fine?
- Yeah.

03:17.195 --> 03:20.696
This is fine?

03:20.698 --> 03:22.031
Right.

03:22.033 --> 03:24.100
What can I do to make you go away?

03:24.102 --> 03:26.001
Just admit that we need to hire a B.U.D.

03:26.003 --> 03:27.703
- A what?
- Backup doc.

03:27.705 --> 03:28.938
I'm narrowing down the candidates.

03:28.940 --> 03:31.040
Just... just let me proceed.

03:31.042 --> 03:32.641
It's not necessary. Okay?

03:32.643 --> 03:36.645
You're overreacting.

03:42.086 --> 03:44.086
Ow, ow!

03:53.564 --> 03:55.397
All right, you can proceed.

03:55.399 --> 03:58.400
But first, how about giving me a hand?

04:08.245 --> 04:10.012
So what did the auction house say?

04:10.014 --> 04:11.680
They seem interested.

04:11.682 --> 04:13.315
I have an appointment
later on this afternoon.

04:13.317 --> 04:15.317
That's great.
Do you want me to go with you?

04:15.319 --> 04:16.385
You don't mind?

04:16.387 --> 04:17.620
Not at all.

04:17.622 --> 04:18.620
I'm actually kind of curious

04:18.623 --> 04:20.623
to see what it's worth.

04:23.994 --> 04:26.562
Hmm.

04:26.564 --> 04:28.464
Hello, Paul.

04:28.466 --> 04:30.432
Mm, perfect.

04:30.434 --> 04:32.701
It's full-bodied, piquant,

04:32.703 --> 04:34.770
- with just a hint of...
- What are you doing here?

04:34.772 --> 04:37.540
I am Hank for the day... or two.

04:37.542 --> 04:39.542
So you just happened to send your resume

04:39.544 --> 04:41.177
to where Divya works.

04:41.179 --> 04:42.511
I'm sorry.

04:42.513 --> 04:44.914
You were probably just talking to her.

04:44.916 --> 04:47.950
So you just happened to send
your resume to where I work?

04:47.952 --> 04:50.586
Well, a headhunter told me
that Evan was looking,

04:50.588 --> 04:52.555
and yeah, it didn't hurt
that I knew you worked here.

04:52.557 --> 04:53.622
I thought it would be fun.

04:53.624 --> 04:54.757
And that's it?

04:54.759 --> 04:55.891
What else is there?

04:55.893 --> 04:57.593
Unless I mispronounced "piquant."

04:57.595 --> 04:58.694
I've heard it two different ways.

04:58.696 --> 05:00.262
Okay, so if you guys are done

05:00.264 --> 05:02.131
with awkward social hour,
do you mind if we...

05:02.133 --> 05:03.766
While Hank is moving in slow motion,

05:03.768 --> 05:05.868
Dr. Van Dyke will be filling in
for him for the next few days.

05:05.870 --> 05:07.670
Here are the schedules.

05:07.672 --> 05:08.904
Patients with asterisks
next to their names

05:08.906 --> 05:10.406
are potential retainer clients.

05:10.408 --> 05:12.308
Any questions? No?

05:12.310 --> 05:13.842
Good. Staff meeting adjourned...

05:13.844 --> 05:15.544
in record time.

05:15.546 --> 05:18.581
All right, ladies, do us proud.

05:18.583 --> 05:20.916
Great.

05:20.918 --> 05:22.084
You ready?

05:22.086 --> 05:24.553
Wait, isn't Divya coming with me?

05:24.555 --> 05:26.755
No, no, she's got her own patients.

05:26.757 --> 05:29.258
I'm coming with you because
I have to show you the ropes.

05:29.260 --> 05:32.228
It's gonna be awesome.

05:32.230 --> 05:33.896
Okay.

05:33.898 --> 05:37.533
You're the boss.

05:37.535 --> 05:39.268
Hmm.

06:00.950 --> 06:05.950

06:19.592 --> 06:21.460
Hi.

06:21.462 --> 06:22.761
What happened to you?

06:22.763 --> 06:25.097
I woke up yesterday with a bad back.

06:25.099 --> 06:26.398
Well, have you been doing
anything differently lately?

06:26.400 --> 06:28.233
Yeah, I took golf lessons.

06:28.235 --> 06:29.268
Oh, yeah, well, see, that's what happens

06:29.270 --> 06:30.636
when you swing like a girl.

06:30.638 --> 06:32.905
No offense.

06:32.907 --> 06:35.040
Mm. Okay, that's not gonna work.

06:35.042 --> 06:37.276
So what are we doing?

06:37.278 --> 06:38.844
So the plan today

06:38.846 --> 06:40.245
is to sit down with your nephrologist

06:40.247 --> 06:41.547
and discuss your treatment options,

06:41.549 --> 06:42.748
given that your kidney biopsy

06:42.750 --> 06:44.183
confirmed lupus nephritis.

06:44.185 --> 06:45.551
Any questions before we go in?

06:45.553 --> 06:47.085
Yeah, you ever watch that '80s sitcom,

06:47.087 --> 06:48.086
<i>"U.F.O. My Gosh!"</i> ?

06:48.088 --> 06:50.489
About the alien girl who stayed

06:50.491 --> 06:51.824
with the perfect American family

06:51.826 --> 06:54.660
who beamed a weekly life lesson
back to her home planet

06:54.662 --> 06:55.894
at the end of every episode,

06:55.896 --> 06:56.929
whose catchphrase was,

06:56.931 --> 06:58.564
"I'm outta here!" ?

06:58.566 --> 06:59.898
- That's the one.
- Never heard of it. Why?

07:01.469 --> 07:04.470
Okay, I'm, like, only 87% sure

07:04.472 --> 07:06.738
that my nephrologist, Dr. Nina Greene,

07:06.740 --> 07:09.608
is actually Nina De Crinis, the actress

07:09.610 --> 07:11.176
- that played the little girl.
- Come on.

07:11.178 --> 07:12.177
Check it out.

07:12.179 --> 07:16.148
Thank you, Vicky. Thank you.

07:16.150 --> 07:17.883
I'm outta here!

07:17.885 --> 07:21.954
Jack, we're ready for you.

07:21.956 --> 07:23.121
You must be Dr. Lawson.

07:23.123 --> 07:24.256
I'm Nina Greene.

07:24.258 --> 07:25.524
Nice to meet you.

07:25.526 --> 07:26.725
I've heard a lot about you.

07:26.727 --> 07:29.027
It's mutual.

07:29.029 --> 07:30.596
All right. Right this way.

07:30.598 --> 07:31.497
- That's not her.
- That's definitely her.

07:31.499 --> 07:32.531
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

07:32.533 --> 07:34.199
Shut up. Ow.

07:42.709 --> 07:44.276
Is this a company car?

07:44.278 --> 07:46.845
No. No, it's my car.

07:46.847 --> 07:48.113
What, you got a problem
with minivans, man?

07:48.115 --> 07:50.482
No, no, I think they're great

07:50.484 --> 07:51.984
if you're a soccer mom

07:51.986 --> 07:53.952
and if your favorite movie
is <i>"Eat, Pray, Love"</i>

07:53.954 --> 07:55.954
and you like listening to Coldplay.

07:55.956 --> 07:57.289
Well, she drives like a cloud.

07:57.291 --> 07:58.524
Good, good.

07:58.526 --> 07:59.925
That'll make it more comfortable

07:59.927 --> 08:01.059
while you're dropping off orange slices

08:01.061 --> 08:02.327
and water bottles for the kids.

08:05.965 --> 08:08.700
Just a FYI, you don't need the coat.

08:08.702 --> 08:11.637
Um, Hank keeps things pretty casual.

08:11.639 --> 08:13.705
Just... it's more personal.

08:13.707 --> 08:14.873
His patients don't even call him doctor.

08:14.875 --> 08:16.141
That's great for Hank,

08:16.143 --> 08:17.643
but I think that someone in need

08:17.645 --> 08:19.745
of medical attention
doesn't want a guy to come in

08:19.747 --> 08:21.380
and say, "hi, I'm Paul."

08:21.382 --> 08:23.482
So what's the emergency?

08:23.484 --> 08:25.417
It's a mole check.

08:25.419 --> 08:26.485
Good God, man.

08:26.487 --> 08:28.520
What are we doing standing here?

08:32.558 --> 08:35.527
So, Edie, I don't see anything here

08:35.529 --> 08:37.828
that you need to alert
your dermatologist about.

08:37.831 --> 08:40.232
And I've uploaded your file,
so he's got a record.

08:40.234 --> 08:42.768
Wow, that's great.
Thank you, Dr. Van Dyke.

08:42.770 --> 08:45.337
Mm, "doctor."

08:45.339 --> 08:47.906
So do you and your sister spend
a lot of time in the sun?

08:47.908 --> 08:49.708
Actually, Laura's not my sister.

08:49.710 --> 08:51.209
She's my stepmother.

08:51.211 --> 08:54.379
That's my sister Cecilia.

08:56.649 --> 09:01.019
And yeah, we do spend
a lot of time in the sun.

09:01.021 --> 09:02.421
I know. Bad, right?

09:02.423 --> 09:04.756
No, no, I think you guys
should keep tanning.

09:04.758 --> 09:06.558
My dermatology colleagues
have mortgages to pay,

09:06.560 --> 09:09.895
and they make a lot of money
cutting growths

09:09.897 --> 09:12.164
off of people's faces and
repairing them with skin grafts.

09:12.166 --> 09:14.399
Maybe you should do
a mole check on my sister too.

09:14.401 --> 09:16.034
Just curious. How many people
are in the family?

09:16.036 --> 09:17.569
All together, five.

09:17.571 --> 09:19.371
You know, you might save
a little bit of money

09:19.373 --> 09:22.007
if you become a Hankmed retainer client

09:22.009 --> 09:23.342
rather than pay for each visit.

09:23.344 --> 09:26.545
Why don't you talk
to our CFO, Mr. Lawson,

09:26.547 --> 09:28.380
while I examine Cecilia?

09:28.382 --> 09:31.883
Thanks.

09:33.019 --> 09:35.187
Hi.

09:39.759 --> 09:43.462
It's very unusual to find
a complete service for 12

09:43.464 --> 09:46.698
in such good condition.

09:46.700 --> 09:48.600
Come with me.

09:48.602 --> 09:51.236
It's been in my family

09:51.238 --> 09:53.071
for generations.

09:53.073 --> 09:55.574
As far as I know, it's never been used.

09:55.576 --> 09:58.543
If I can physically inspect it
to guarantee

09:58.545 --> 10:01.246
its authenticity and condition,

10:01.248 --> 10:02.748
I'm pretty sure I have a buyer

10:02.750 --> 10:05.417
that would pay a tidy sum for it.

10:05.419 --> 10:07.052
How tidy?

10:07.054 --> 10:09.388
Here is what a similar set
went for last year

10:09.390 --> 10:11.757
at auction.

10:11.759 --> 10:13.592
When do you think you could bring it in?

10:13.594 --> 10:15.260
Tomorrow. She'll bring it tomorrow.

10:15.262 --> 10:16.428
How's noon?

10:16.430 --> 10:20.465
Noon is great.

10:20.467 --> 10:21.466
How's noon?

10:21.468 --> 10:23.468
Let's see.

10:26.072 --> 10:27.773
Dude.

10:27.775 --> 10:29.608
That was awesome.

10:29.610 --> 10:30.809
You were awesome.

10:30.811 --> 10:32.277
You got them to sign a retainer.

10:32.279 --> 10:33.879
They had an asterisk.

10:33.881 --> 10:35.313
That's right. That's right. They did.

10:35.315 --> 10:36.815
- They did.
- That's my job.

10:36.817 --> 10:38.417
You are running a business here, right?

10:38.419 --> 10:40.052
Yes! Exactly.

10:40.054 --> 10:42.854
How am I the only one
who understands this?

10:42.856 --> 10:44.189
See, I assumed

10:44.191 --> 10:45.323
when you came along
that that was the plan.

10:45.325 --> 10:47.659
Isn't that what you and Hank do?

10:47.661 --> 10:49.127
Well...

10:51.632 --> 10:53.031
You like cars, huh?

10:53.033 --> 10:54.900
I like my car.

10:54.902 --> 10:57.002
You want to drive tomorrow?

10:57.004 --> 10:58.203
That's a great idea.

10:58.205 --> 10:59.838
We'd be able to see
twice as many patients.

10:59.840 --> 11:01.440
What's next?

11:01.442 --> 11:04.476
Triplets. They need physicals
for summer camp.

11:04.478 --> 11:05.777
Are they a retainer client?

11:05.779 --> 11:08.280
- No.
- Well, they will be.

11:08.282 --> 11:09.681
Can I just say something?

11:09.683 --> 11:11.516
You are the Yin to my Yang.

11:11.518 --> 11:13.919
Like, seriously, you're the salt
to my pepper.

11:13.921 --> 11:15.353
You... you're...

11:15.355 --> 11:17.322
If you say I complete you,
I'm out of here.

11:17.324 --> 11:19.858
I would never say that. Come on.

11:19.860 --> 11:22.227
But you do.

11:23.297 --> 11:25.030
Divya, how great is this?

11:25.032 --> 11:27.232
Too bad you didn't do it sooner.

11:27.234 --> 11:28.500
Yeah, I guess.

11:28.502 --> 11:30.235
Oh, please tell me that you're not having

11:30.237 --> 11:31.636
second thoughts about selling your china.

11:31.638 --> 11:33.705
I'm not.

11:33.707 --> 11:34.706
I just regret that no one in my family

11:34.708 --> 11:36.308
ever used it.

11:36.310 --> 11:37.542
We weren't allowed to.

11:37.544 --> 11:40.979
What's sad is I forgot I even had it

11:40.981 --> 11:42.481
until I moved.

11:42.483 --> 11:44.750
Well you know what, by noon tomorrow,

11:44.752 --> 11:46.818
you'll have a boatload of cash.

11:49.989 --> 11:51.690
Thank you, Floyd.

11:51.692 --> 11:53.892
Uh, excuse me, this is a 20.

11:53.894 --> 11:55.594
Parking's only $5.

11:55.596 --> 11:57.129
Why don't you keep the change?

11:57.131 --> 11:58.797
Wow.

11:58.799 --> 12:02.033
Thank you.

12:09.408 --> 12:13.245
Okay, so your current
classification of lupus

12:13.247 --> 12:14.513
is class IV.

12:14.515 --> 12:16.681
There are a number
of different treatment options.

12:16.683 --> 12:18.884
Yeah, the conventional
treatment is steroids

12:18.886 --> 12:20.318
and cyclophosphamide.

12:20.320 --> 12:21.219
That could give you years
before you even have

12:21.221 --> 12:22.420
to think about dialysis.

12:22.422 --> 12:23.789
Yeah, on the other hand,

12:23.791 --> 12:25.857
since you've never had
any treatment before,

12:25.859 --> 12:28.026
you are a perfect candidate
for a clinical trial.

12:28.028 --> 12:29.728
Is it a double blind?

12:29.730 --> 12:31.129
Yes.

12:31.131 --> 12:33.131
Okay, okay, which means
he could get a placebo.

12:33.133 --> 12:34.399
A placebo, right?

12:34.401 --> 12:37.536
Come on, doc. Look at this guy.

12:37.538 --> 12:39.304
Can you... can you give him, like,
something for his pain?

12:39.306 --> 12:40.906
I'm fine. I'm fine.

12:40.908 --> 12:43.041
"I'm fine. I'm fine."

12:43.043 --> 12:44.409
Jack.

12:44.411 --> 12:46.745
Well, if you want a shot of valium later,

12:46.747 --> 12:50.015
relief is just 2 milligrams away.

12:50.017 --> 12:53.585
Um, I'm good, everyone. So where were we?

12:53.587 --> 12:54.920
Clinical trials.

12:54.922 --> 12:57.455
There is an experimental drug
called nephrostatin,

12:57.457 --> 12:59.057
and it's showing very good results

12:59.059 --> 13:00.425
in prolonging kidney function.

13:00.427 --> 13:01.593
What are the side effects?

13:01.595 --> 13:02.894
Well, they're not too dissimilar

13:02.896 --> 13:04.329
from traditional therapy.

13:04.331 --> 13:05.997
But as I said before,
it's a double blind trial.

13:05.999 --> 13:08.500
If he gets a placebo,
that means he wouldn't receive

13:08.502 --> 13:10.135
any treatment for at least the
first six months of the trial.

13:10.137 --> 13:11.837
I mean, I think it's better
to be on something

13:11.839 --> 13:14.472
rather than risk the possibility
of being on nothing.

13:14.474 --> 13:16.775
What is it?

13:16.777 --> 13:18.109
You're her, aren't you?

13:18.111 --> 13:20.846
Who?

13:20.848 --> 13:23.281
Nina De Crinis,
the girl from <i>U.F.O. My Gosh!</i>

13:23.283 --> 13:25.517
From where?

13:25.519 --> 13:26.718
What was Tom Bosley like?

13:26.720 --> 13:28.153
- Oh, God.
- Was he all hands?

13:28.155 --> 13:29.421
He was probably all hands.
Was he all hands?

13:29.423 --> 13:30.488
- Was he trying...
- Come on.

13:30.490 --> 13:32.691
- Hmm?
- This is serious.

13:32.693 --> 13:35.694
We can lay out your options,
but at the end of the day,

13:35.696 --> 13:38.563
it's your decision.

13:38.565 --> 13:40.465
So what you're saying is both have risks,

13:40.467 --> 13:43.235
so I might as well just flip a coin.

13:43.237 --> 13:45.871
Um, that's not exactly what we're say...

13:52.078 --> 13:55.847
Who wants to call it?

14:20.306 --> 14:23.308
All right. Let's do this.

14:32.718 --> 14:35.720
Hank! Thank Heaven you're he...

14:37.490 --> 14:38.657
You're not Hank.

14:38.659 --> 14:40.959
Yeah, Ms. Newberg, this is Dr. Van Dyke.

14:40.961 --> 14:42.060
He's filling in today.

14:42.062 --> 14:43.295
And he's excellent.

14:43.297 --> 14:45.297
Like, Harvard excellent.

14:45.299 --> 14:46.731
But where's Hank?

14:46.733 --> 14:48.133
His back is out.

14:48.135 --> 14:50.535
Don't worry. I will take
very good care of you.

14:50.537 --> 14:52.103
Very good?

14:52.105 --> 14:54.072
Hank takes excellent care of me.

14:54.074 --> 14:56.775
Ms. Newberg,
you said it was an emergency.

14:56.777 --> 14:58.143
What's the emergency?

14:58.145 --> 15:00.512
I think I'm dying.

15:20.987 --> 15:23.789
- Hey, grandma, you made it.
- Yeah.

15:23.791 --> 15:25.191
Look, I hope you're not here
to talk me out of this,

15:25.193 --> 15:27.793
because I'm already at page 9
out of, oh, 400,

15:27.795 --> 15:29.495
so there's kind of no turning back.

15:32.533 --> 15:34.166
I am not here to talk you out of it.

15:34.168 --> 15:35.534
I'm not even here as one of your doctors.

15:35.536 --> 15:36.702
I'm here as your friend.

15:36.704 --> 15:37.770
Oh, then as my friend,

15:37.772 --> 15:39.104
would you sign these for me?

15:39.106 --> 15:45.077
Real friend would.

15:45.079 --> 15:48.948
Jack, you're not taking this seriously.

15:48.950 --> 15:51.984
Why, because I flipped a coin
to make a decision

15:51.986 --> 15:53.652
about something
I'm now not reading about?

15:53.654 --> 15:55.688
Yeah.

15:55.690 --> 15:58.023
It's risky, Panky. I get it, okay?

15:58.025 --> 15:59.925
I get it, but...

15:59.927 --> 16:01.493
It's how I live my life.

16:01.495 --> 16:02.528
Oh, what do you know?

16:02.530 --> 16:03.963
You know what, I'm listing you

16:03.965 --> 16:05.731
as my "in case of emergency" contact.

16:05.733 --> 16:08.167
People don't typically put
their doctor there.

16:08.169 --> 16:09.702
That's usually for family.

16:09.704 --> 16:11.036
Yeah?

16:11.038 --> 16:13.305
Well, I only see my family at
Easter and Christmas.

16:13.307 --> 16:14.640
Kind of a rule.

16:14.642 --> 16:16.141
They live in San Diego.

16:16.143 --> 16:18.244
I live out of a suitcase.

16:18.246 --> 16:20.813
It's been that way
ever since I joined the tour

16:20.815 --> 16:22.314
out of college.

16:22.316 --> 16:25.818
Never had the urge to settle down?

16:25.820 --> 16:27.753
Well, I did settle down.

16:27.755 --> 16:30.289
I was married.

16:30.291 --> 16:31.490
Yeah, married at 24,

16:31.492 --> 16:33.826
divorced at 24 1/2.

16:33.828 --> 16:35.160
Hey, at what age you think

16:35.162 --> 16:37.096
people should stop using the "half"?

16:37.098 --> 16:39.098
I'm 9 1/2... 10.

16:39.100 --> 16:41.033
- 10.
- Hmm, okay.

16:41.035 --> 16:43.335
By the way,

16:43.337 --> 16:46.171
I'm not listing you
because you're my doctor.

16:46.173 --> 16:52.144
I'm listing you because you're my friend.

16:52.146 --> 16:55.881
You already said you were my friend.

16:55.883 --> 17:00.386
You can't take it back.

17:12.799 --> 17:15.134
Careful.

17:15.136 --> 17:17.502
My china's back there.

17:17.505 --> 17:19.538
It's wearing a seat belt.
I'm pretty sure it's safe.

17:19.540 --> 17:22.540
Come on.

17:26.413 --> 17:27.646
Almost ready.

17:27.647 --> 17:29.248
Could you have a seat, please?

17:29.250 --> 17:30.416
Sure.

17:30.418 --> 17:31.850
Roll up your sleeve.

17:31.852 --> 17:33.852
Oh, of course.

17:41.161 --> 17:44.163
This is going to pinch a little.

17:44.165 --> 17:47.666
Can you believe you still need
a polio shot to go to India?

17:47.668 --> 17:51.170
Which reminds me,
I'm leaving for the airport

17:51.172 --> 17:52.604
in 15 minutes.

17:52.606 --> 17:53.939
We'll be done by then, right?

17:53.941 --> 17:57.710
Yeah.

17:57.712 --> 17:59.678
Perfect.

17:59.680 --> 18:00.846
Thank you.

18:00.848 --> 18:02.381
Mr. Mackintosh.

18:02.383 --> 18:04.283
This red bump,

18:04.285 --> 18:06.018
how long have you had this?

18:06.020 --> 18:07.619
I don't know, a week or two.

18:07.621 --> 18:09.221
It's just a mosquito bite.

18:09.223 --> 18:11.023
Probably got it in Panama.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.394
Do you have any duct tape?

18:15.396 --> 18:17.863
I'm sure I do. I wouldn't know where.

18:17.865 --> 18:19.064
I'd have to ask my handyman.

18:19.066 --> 18:21.467
How about bacon?

18:27.307 --> 18:28.407
What is that?

18:28.409 --> 18:31.310
Have you ever heard of botflies?

18:31.312 --> 18:34.213
They're the only fly that use
humans as host to its larvae.

18:34.215 --> 18:36.715
The larvae burrow
under the skin of the host,

18:36.717 --> 18:37.783
where they grow.

18:37.785 --> 18:38.951
And they love breakfast meats.

18:38.953 --> 18:40.886
No. Bacon makes a good seal.

18:40.888 --> 18:43.355
And draws it to the surface.

18:58.138 --> 19:01.640
It starts with a radiating
pain at the base of my spine

19:01.642 --> 19:03.742
and then it works its way up to my neck.

19:03.744 --> 19:06.011
Okay. Are you feeling it now?

19:06.013 --> 19:07.446
No.

19:07.448 --> 19:10.349
But it comes and goes almost at random.

19:10.351 --> 19:12.885
And how long has this been happening?

19:12.887 --> 19:14.553
Maybe a few weeks.

19:14.555 --> 19:17.623
But it did go away when I went
to see Eddie in Florida.

19:17.625 --> 19:19.892
Do you think it's spinal meningitis?

19:19.894 --> 19:21.226
Probably not.

19:21.228 --> 19:24.363
Um, has there been any change
in your daily routine?

19:24.365 --> 19:26.565
No, except that I've
been renovating my house

19:26.567 --> 19:29.067
because of storm damage, which
is why I rented this place.

19:29.069 --> 19:31.503
Have you been doing
any heavy lifting, Ms. Newberg?

19:31.505 --> 19:33.172
Did you just meet me?

19:33.174 --> 19:35.007
That's a good point.

19:35.009 --> 19:37.142
Go ahead, you can tell me.

19:37.144 --> 19:38.911
It's serious, isn't it?

19:38.913 --> 19:41.847
You know what, so far I haven't been able

19:41.849 --> 19:44.216
to find anything wrong,
serious or otherwise,

19:44.218 --> 19:47.586
but to be sure, let's run
a full battery of tests.

19:49.889 --> 19:51.857
Huh. Full battery.

19:51.859 --> 19:53.859
See?

19:58.698 --> 20:00.866
A botfly? Seriously?

20:00.868 --> 20:02.701
I mean, for a second there,
I felt like I was back

20:02.703 --> 20:03.869
in <i>El Puertito.</i>

20:03.871 --> 20:07.272
It was so nasty awesome.

20:07.274 --> 20:08.907
You miss being there, don't you?

20:08.909 --> 20:10.709
I do.

20:10.711 --> 20:12.311
And the more I think about it,

20:12.313 --> 20:15.280
the more I'm sure
it's where I want to be.

20:15.282 --> 20:17.282
Divya.

20:17.284 --> 20:18.550
Did you leave your car door open?

20:18.552 --> 20:21.720
That's odd.

20:21.722 --> 20:23.255
- Is that Floyd?
- Who?

20:23.257 --> 20:25.290
The valet from yesterday.

20:25.292 --> 20:27.326
Oh, my God, he's got my china.

20:27.328 --> 20:28.927
- Okay, what do we do?
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.

20:28.929 --> 20:30.195
He's... he's getting in his car.

20:30.197 --> 20:31.630
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Okay, okay.

20:31.632 --> 20:33.165
So how does this work?

20:33.167 --> 20:35.067
- We chase him.
- Okay, until what?

20:35.069 --> 20:37.469
Until we catch him.

20:37.471 --> 20:38.504
- Okay, then what?
- I don't know.

20:38.506 --> 20:39.905
I've never been in hot pursuit

20:39.907 --> 20:40.739
of stolen cups and saucers
before, but drive!

20:40.741 --> 20:44.576
Drive. Go, go, go.

21:04.130 --> 21:05.631
I mean, where is he going?

21:05.633 --> 21:08.367
I don't know, but try to stay with him.

21:12.872 --> 21:14.439
Okay, we're losing him.

21:14.441 --> 21:15.507
Well, then gun it, Divya. Gun it.

21:15.509 --> 21:17.175
Go, go, go.

21:26.085 --> 21:27.219
Ah!

21:28.622 --> 21:30.122
What was that?

21:30.124 --> 21:32.190
Slow down, slow down.

21:43.736 --> 21:46.505
- My grandmother's China.
- I'm so sorry, Divya.

21:56.649 --> 21:58.584
Oh, my God.

21:58.586 --> 22:00.252
Call 911.

22:04.343 --> 22:06.376
What happened?

22:06.378 --> 22:07.878
You've been in a car accident.

22:07.880 --> 22:09.313
Your jeep went through a fence.

22:09.315 --> 22:11.115
An accident? I don't remember...

22:11.117 --> 22:12.750
Do not move. My name is Divya.

22:12.752 --> 22:13.984
I'm a physician assistant.

22:13.986 --> 22:15.953
I'm gonna help you until the EMTs arrive.

22:15.955 --> 22:20.791
Divya, here's the morphine
and the other supplies.

22:20.793 --> 22:21.925
How can I help?

22:21.927 --> 22:23.994
Talk to him. Keep him alert.

22:23.996 --> 22:27.564
Hey, Floyd, Floyd, hey.

22:27.566 --> 22:28.999
I need you to look at me.

22:29.001 --> 22:30.667
How long were you following us?

22:30.669 --> 22:32.736
How long were you following Divya?

22:32.738 --> 22:35.939
Okay, by questions, I meant
things like, um, I don't know,

22:35.941 --> 22:37.441
"What's your name? What year is it?"

22:37.443 --> 22:39.476
- "Who's the president?"
- Okay, you've got your way.

22:39.478 --> 22:40.944
I've got mine.

22:40.946 --> 22:42.479
So how did you even know where she lives?

22:42.481 --> 22:44.581
I got her address
out of the glove compartment

22:44.583 --> 22:46.049
and I heard...

22:46.051 --> 22:48.152
Heard us talking
at the valet stand, okay.

22:48.154 --> 22:49.553
So you knew she was coming back

22:49.555 --> 22:50.754
to the auction house today, didn't you?

22:50.756 --> 22:53.590
Is that a fence post
through my windshield?

22:53.592 --> 22:54.858
Stay with me.

22:54.860 --> 22:57.327
Is that a fence post through me?

22:57.329 --> 22:59.329
- No, no, Floyd.
- Get it out!

22:59.331 --> 23:01.865
- Get it out!
- No! Floyd, listen to me.

23:01.867 --> 23:04.601
There is only one rule
for this kind of injury.

23:04.603 --> 23:07.871
Never remove the impaling object
until you get to the E.R.

23:07.873 --> 23:10.440
I know that it seems
counterintuitive, okay?

23:10.442 --> 23:11.675
But trust me.

23:11.677 --> 23:14.812
Hey, Floyd, try and focus on your family.

23:14.814 --> 23:18.282
- Okay?
- That's not my family.

23:18.284 --> 23:19.683
And this isn't your car, is it?

23:19.685 --> 23:21.385
Okay, what is the ETA on the ambulance?

23:21.387 --> 23:23.353
I don't know. My calls kept dropping.

23:23.355 --> 23:25.289
Maybe I should drive
until I do find service.

23:25.291 --> 23:26.857
Okay, no, I don't think

23:26.859 --> 23:28.225
that we have time
to wait for an ambulance.

23:28.227 --> 23:30.127
He's looking more diaphoretic,
which means

23:30.129 --> 23:31.295
that his blood pressure is dropping.

23:31.297 --> 23:32.696
I think that we have to get him

23:32.698 --> 23:34.298
to the E.R. ourselves.

23:34.300 --> 23:35.666
Okay, how do we do that?

23:49.615 --> 23:51.014
Hey.

23:51.016 --> 23:53.483
- Hey.
- How are you doing?

23:56.454 --> 24:01.191
So you will let
90% of the blood in your body

24:01.193 --> 24:04.194
pool in your head, but you
won't take any medication.

24:04.196 --> 24:05.662
- That's right.
- That's just not you.

24:05.664 --> 24:06.797
That's just not me.

24:06.799 --> 24:08.465
That's some good doctoring.

24:08.467 --> 24:09.933
Hope Jack fared better than you.

24:09.935 --> 24:11.201
So far so good.

24:11.203 --> 24:12.569
You know, for Jack, at least.

24:12.571 --> 24:13.604
What's that?

24:13.606 --> 24:14.638
Now I can barely understand

24:14.640 --> 24:15.672
what you're saying. Huh?

24:15.674 --> 24:17.274
You're gonna make me do this.

24:17.276 --> 24:20.177
Okay. Coming down.

24:24.115 --> 24:26.383
Ow. You're not...

24:27.519 --> 24:29.453
Jesus.

24:29.455 --> 24:30.954
Okay, okay, I'm fine.

24:30.956 --> 24:32.589
I'm feeling a little better.

24:32.591 --> 24:33.757
- Yeah, you look a lot better.
- Yeah.

24:33.759 --> 24:36.660
Henry...

24:36.662 --> 24:38.095
just take the drugs.

24:38.097 --> 24:39.796
- I don't need meds.
- Oh, God.

24:39.798 --> 24:41.465
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

24:41.467 --> 24:43.667
I've been bombarded all day
with prescription confirmations

24:43.669 --> 24:44.968
and test results. What's going on?

24:44.970 --> 24:46.837
And why did Divya send Newberg
for an MRI?

24:46.839 --> 24:48.639
She didn't. Dr. Van Dyke did.

24:48.641 --> 24:50.073
Dr. Van what?

24:50.075 --> 24:51.642
Yeah, he was also the one
who called in the tests

24:51.644 --> 24:53.844
and the prescriptions.
I hired him as our B.U.D.

24:53.846 --> 24:56.313
Are we talking about Dr. Paul Van Dyke?

24:56.315 --> 24:57.648
Hamptons Heritage Van Dyke?

24:57.650 --> 24:59.750
That's the guy. He's awesome.

24:59.752 --> 25:00.984
Why would you hire him?

25:00.986 --> 25:03.120
Because you told me to proceed.

25:03.122 --> 25:04.388
Yeah, proceed meant to get

25:04.390 --> 25:06.156
a list of candidates together
and show me.

25:06.158 --> 25:07.824
I would then interview, review,

25:07.826 --> 25:10.193
and approve the potential candidate.

25:10.195 --> 25:11.662
That is so not the definition of proceed.

25:11.664 --> 25:13.630
How'd you even manage to hire
Van Dyke in, what,

25:13.632 --> 25:15.132
like an hour's time?

25:15.134 --> 25:16.633
What kind of CFO would I be
if I didn't have

25:16.635 --> 25:17.901
a contingency plan for a guy

25:17.903 --> 25:19.770
who works with sick people all day, huh?

25:19.772 --> 25:21.638
I would fire myself
if I didn't have a plan.

25:21.640 --> 25:23.473
Yeah, and that I would approve!

25:23.475 --> 25:24.775
Approve.

25:24.777 --> 25:26.677
Henry, just relax.

25:26.679 --> 25:28.845
Can't.

25:28.847 --> 25:30.781
He scored five retainers.

25:30.783 --> 25:33.116
Our patients love him,
especially Newberg.

25:33.118 --> 25:36.353
So you just get better
when you get better, okay?

25:36.355 --> 25:38.855
Seriously.

25:38.857 --> 25:40.290
Don't rush it.

25:40.292 --> 25:42.559
Evan, Evan, come back here, young man.

25:42.561 --> 25:43.527
I'm not done talking to you.

25:43.529 --> 25:44.962
Let's talk upstairs.

25:44.964 --> 25:48.732
Can't. Can't. Can't.

25:48.734 --> 25:50.500
I found the cast cutter.

25:50.502 --> 25:52.235
Great.

25:54.405 --> 25:56.506
Okay, we can use it to cut the post off,

25:56.508 --> 25:58.008
and then we're gonna pull him
out of the car.

26:03.848 --> 26:05.382
Wait, wait, wait, stop, stop.

26:05.384 --> 26:07.050
What?

26:07.052 --> 26:08.752
Do you smell that?

26:08.754 --> 26:09.886
It's gasoline.

26:09.888 --> 26:12.923
It's leaking all over the place.

26:12.925 --> 26:15.559
We can't risk any sparks.

26:15.561 --> 26:18.729
No, we can't. Do we have a plan B?

26:23.568 --> 26:26.069
Are you sure about this?

26:26.071 --> 26:27.437
The morphine should help.

26:27.439 --> 26:28.638
He's barely conscious,

26:28.640 --> 26:30.307
so hopefully he won't register the pain.

26:30.309 --> 26:31.708
Well, you did say never to remove

26:31.710 --> 26:33.710
an impaled object... ever.

26:33.712 --> 26:35.812
I know, but his vitals are crashing,

26:35.814 --> 26:37.347
so we have no choice.

26:37.349 --> 26:39.983
If we don't remove the pole
and cauterize the wound,

26:39.985 --> 26:41.818
he will go into hemorrhagic shock.

26:41.820 --> 26:43.253
On three, Jill.

26:43.255 --> 26:45.188
Okay. One...

26:45.190 --> 26:46.823
two, three.

26:50.362 --> 26:52.429
Here's a new way to apply quikclot.

26:52.431 --> 26:53.997
Faster. He's coming to.

26:55.533 --> 26:58.201
Like pulling out one cork
and replacing it with another.

26:58.203 --> 26:59.269
Exactly.

27:11.783 --> 27:12.916
He's still breathing.

27:12.918 --> 27:15.052
Okay, good. Good.

27:15.054 --> 27:17.587
Divya, nice work.

27:17.589 --> 27:18.955
Hank would be proud.

27:18.957 --> 27:21.425
Let's get him to the E.R.

27:21.427 --> 27:23.560
I'll get the car.

27:30.568 --> 27:34.638
Oh, God. Where...

27:34.640 --> 27:35.872
Oh, yeah.

27:44.583 --> 27:47.918
Okay.

27:55.660 --> 27:58.261
Relief.

27:58.263 --> 28:01.264
Just 2 milligrams away.

28:11.943 --> 28:14.945
1 milligram.

28:14.947 --> 28:20.150
2 milligra... hey! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

28:20.152 --> 28:22.752
Ow, ow, ah.

28:22.754 --> 28:24.855
Oh.

28:29.327 --> 28:30.827
That's not good.

28:43.007 --> 28:44.774
Look, I know you think this is my fault.

28:44.776 --> 28:47.844
Ah, because it is.

28:47.846 --> 28:50.147
It is your fault.

29:16.207 --> 29:18.175
You killed Hankmed.

29:18.177 --> 29:19.242
You happy?

29:19.244 --> 29:20.343
I killed Hankmed?

29:20.345 --> 29:21.978
What... what are you talking about?

29:21.980 --> 29:24.481
You wouldn't let
the business grow, Henry.

29:24.483 --> 29:25.882
You wouldn't water it.

29:25.884 --> 29:30.253
- I...
- So it withered and it died.

29:30.255 --> 29:32.122
It died, Dr. Lawson.

29:34.725 --> 29:36.560
How could you do this, Hank?

29:36.562 --> 29:38.395
You know how much I needed this job,

29:38.397 --> 29:40.797
especially now that I'm broke.

29:42.100 --> 29:45.268
I can't help you out, Panky.

29:45.270 --> 29:47.504
I don't even know what I'm doing here.

29:53.578 --> 29:57.480
What's gonna happen
to the clinic patients?

29:57.482 --> 29:59.816
You were their only hope, Hank.

29:59.818 --> 30:01.952
You were their only hope.

30:01.954 --> 30:04.287
Jill, I...

30:04.289 --> 30:05.822
What?

30:05.824 --> 30:07.290
Don't look at me for support.

30:07.292 --> 30:09.659
I agree with them, Panky.

30:13.698 --> 30:15.465
Aagh!

30:32.247 --> 30:36.116
I mean, look,
I know her tests show nothing,

30:36.118 --> 30:37.818
you know her tests show nothing,
but she doesn't know that.

30:37.820 --> 30:40.387
- We're here, aren't we?
- Yeah.

30:40.389 --> 30:42.256
But she's probably been
up all night worrying.

30:42.258 --> 30:45.259
You really should have just...
you should have called her

30:45.261 --> 30:46.660
right away, that's all.

30:46.662 --> 30:48.662
Well, I told you, I make my phone calls

30:48.664 --> 30:50.063
at the end of the day.

30:50.065 --> 30:51.331
That's when I was gonna call her.

30:51.333 --> 30:53.133
What if she has questions?

30:53.135 --> 30:54.668
Are you serious?

30:54.670 --> 30:55.669
I'm dead serious.

30:55.671 --> 30:56.770
Our business is face-to-face,

30:56.772 --> 30:58.005
being there 24/7.

30:58.007 --> 30:59.306
It's what Hankmed's all about.

30:59.308 --> 31:03.811
All right. Let's just do this.

31:03.813 --> 31:05.813
That's my line.

31:05.815 --> 31:08.048
What do you mean "nothing"?

31:08.050 --> 31:10.918
How could it be nothing when it
happened again this morning?

31:10.920 --> 31:14.054
See? Questions.

31:14.056 --> 31:16.824
Well, how are you feeling?

31:16.826 --> 31:18.025
Fine.

31:18.027 --> 31:20.394
But when I went to get
a mani-pedi in town,

31:20.396 --> 31:22.663
I felt it again, the radiating pain.

31:22.665 --> 31:25.532
Okay, and are you experiencing
this pain now?

31:25.534 --> 31:27.868
- No, but...
- Well, you should call

31:27.870 --> 31:29.303
if anything changes.

31:29.305 --> 31:30.804
You have our numbers.

31:30.806 --> 31:34.174
Wait.

31:34.176 --> 31:35.843
I'll be right back.

31:35.845 --> 31:38.145
Hey, hey, hey.

31:38.147 --> 31:39.980
What are you doing?

31:39.982 --> 31:41.748
You can't just leave like that.

31:41.750 --> 31:43.917
- She's still upset.
- It sounds psychosomatic.

31:43.919 --> 31:45.319
There's nothing we can do here.

31:45.321 --> 31:47.387
Yeah, okay, but we're Hankmed.

31:47.389 --> 31:49.189
We don't walk out on our patients,

31:49.191 --> 31:50.858
and we never leave a case unsolved.

31:50.860 --> 31:53.460
Okay, I'm a physician,

31:53.462 --> 31:54.628
not the mentalist.

31:54.630 --> 31:57.331
Look, I get that concierge doctors

31:57.333 --> 31:59.132
have to hold their patients'
hands some of the time,

31:59.134 --> 32:01.969
but since when do they have
to carry them around?

32:01.971 --> 32:03.470
Wait, is that how Hank hurt his back?

32:03.472 --> 32:04.938
Oh, that's funny.

32:04.940 --> 32:08.141
Look, you have to do something.

32:08.143 --> 32:11.245
What would you like me to do?

32:11.247 --> 32:13.814
Run some tests, ask some questions.

32:13.816 --> 32:14.982
I don't know, I'm not a doctor.

32:14.984 --> 32:16.583
No, you're not.

32:16.585 --> 32:19.152
Hey, look.

32:19.154 --> 32:21.121
She's not only my dad's girlfriend

32:21.123 --> 32:22.656
and Hankmed's first official patient.

32:22.658 --> 32:26.827
She is one of the kindest, craziest,

32:26.829 --> 32:28.195
most generous people

32:28.197 --> 32:29.563
you will ever have the pleasure
of knowing.

32:29.565 --> 32:31.365
She's awesome, and she's scared.

32:31.367 --> 32:34.668
Is it possible that Hankmed
gets too involved

32:34.670 --> 32:36.970
- with its patients?
- Absolutely.

32:36.972 --> 32:39.706
Yeah, is it possible that you
don't see patients as people?

32:39.708 --> 32:41.742
Yeah.

32:41.744 --> 32:43.043
Sure.

32:43.045 --> 32:44.811
So now that we've got that cleared up,

32:44.813 --> 32:46.446
I've got your busy schedule to keep.

32:46.448 --> 32:48.215
Are you coming, boss?

32:48.217 --> 32:50.984
Yeah, but just...

32:50.986 --> 32:52.786
Hank would never do this.

32:52.788 --> 32:55.489
I'm not Hank.

32:59.861 --> 33:02.162
No, you're not.

33:02.164 --> 33:05.065
Come on.

33:05.067 --> 33:07.067
Hey.

33:07.069 --> 33:09.736
Hello, Floyd.

33:09.738 --> 33:11.638
We just wanted
to see how you were feeling.

33:11.640 --> 33:14.274
Surprisingly good.

33:14.276 --> 33:17.010
The emergency splenectomy I had
to have pretty much sucked,

33:17.012 --> 33:19.413
but the doctors all say I'll be fine.

33:19.415 --> 33:21.181
And the jell-o's not bad.

33:22.684 --> 33:25.986
How about an apology first?

33:25.988 --> 33:30.257
So I do hope, Floyd,
that you will not steal again.

33:30.259 --> 33:33.060
"Steal" is such a harsh word.

33:33.062 --> 33:34.594
And what word would you prefer?

33:34.596 --> 33:36.296
Liberate.

33:36.298 --> 33:39.232
I like to think of myself
as a modern day Robin Hood.

33:39.234 --> 33:43.437
So you rob from the rich
and give to the poor?

33:43.439 --> 33:45.806
No, I don't give to the poor.

33:45.808 --> 33:47.741
That's the "modern day" part.

33:47.743 --> 33:49.176
But I do only steal from those

33:49.178 --> 33:50.744
who can afford to be stolen from.

33:50.746 --> 33:53.547
Plus, it's all insured, right?

33:53.549 --> 33:55.215
My china was not insured.

33:55.217 --> 33:58.452
Well, it's not a perfect system.

33:58.454 --> 34:01.121
Worst apology ever.

34:01.123 --> 34:04.091
You're right.

34:04.093 --> 34:08.195
Thank you, Divya.

34:08.197 --> 34:10.864
Thanks for saving my life.

34:10.866 --> 34:13.533
Better.

34:16.204 --> 34:18.205
Could you?

34:25.413 --> 34:26.446
Hey, before you go,

34:26.447 --> 34:27.781
I have something for you.

34:27.783 --> 34:29.916
After we brought Floyd to the E.R.,

34:29.918 --> 34:31.518
I went back to the accident site

34:31.520 --> 34:35.389
and grabbed a few of the bigger pieces.

34:35.391 --> 34:37.991
You glued this back together for me?

34:37.993 --> 34:39.292
Well, I had a little help.

34:39.293 --> 34:41.628
My nephew Luke, he's great at puzzles.

34:41.630 --> 34:45.498
And in his defense,

34:45.501 --> 34:47.400
there were a lot of pieces missing.

34:50.806 --> 34:52.572
I'm really gonna miss you.

34:52.574 --> 34:54.241
I'm gonna miss you too.

34:57.412 --> 34:59.146
Could you?

34:59.148 --> 35:01.848
Bye, Floyd.

35:01.850 --> 35:04.351
A little help, please?

35:08.523 --> 35:11.992
Are you sure this is a good idea?

35:11.994 --> 35:15.262
Yes, taking you to see Hank
is a great idea.

35:15.264 --> 35:17.764
I just wish I'd thought of it sooner.

35:17.766 --> 35:20.767
Do you mind if we turn this music down?

35:20.769 --> 35:23.437
Sure. Just don't ask me for help.

35:23.439 --> 35:26.306
I don't know how anything
in this car works yet.

35:26.308 --> 35:27.841
It's too high-tech.

35:27.843 --> 35:30.110
Yeah, it's pretty high-tech. There we go.

35:30.112 --> 35:34.481
Oh.

35:34.483 --> 35:36.183
What is it? What's wrong?

35:36.185 --> 35:37.784
Did you really mean

35:37.786 --> 35:41.054
all those nice things you said
about me to Dr. Van Dyke?

35:41.056 --> 35:43.390
Yes. Every word.

35:43.392 --> 35:46.827
You know how much my family
adores you, come on.

35:46.829 --> 35:49.396
Then I finally have
a man who understands me,

35:49.398 --> 35:54.301
children who care about me,
and all at the same time.

35:54.303 --> 35:56.870
Now I can die happy.

35:56.872 --> 35:59.139
Ms. Newberg... Ms. Newberg,

35:59.141 --> 36:00.540
you're not gonna die.

36:00.542 --> 36:02.409
You're not gonna die.

36:02.411 --> 36:03.743
Hank will make sure of that.

36:03.745 --> 36:05.645
It's too late.

36:05.647 --> 36:08.915
My symptoms, they're back.

36:08.917 --> 36:12.552
They're...

36:12.554 --> 36:16.790
By any chance, does this pain
start in your lower back

36:16.792 --> 36:18.592
and radiate up to your neck?

36:18.594 --> 36:20.494
Yes.

36:20.496 --> 36:22.662
Did it begin shortly
after we left your house?

36:22.664 --> 36:24.698
Yes.

36:24.700 --> 36:28.034
Does the pain kind of feel like heat?

36:30.071 --> 36:33.607
Yes.

36:42.884 --> 36:45.919
- Are you serious?
- Yup.

36:45.921 --> 36:48.088
You've been driving around
with your seat warmers on.

36:48.090 --> 36:50.290
And judging by how hot my neck is,

36:50.292 --> 36:53.226
you probably... neck warmers!

36:53.228 --> 36:55.328
So...

36:55.330 --> 36:56.696
I'm not gonna die.

36:56.698 --> 36:58.899
You are not gonna die.

36:58.901 --> 37:01.301
- Oh, thank God.
- Yeah.

37:01.303 --> 37:05.405
I am so not ready to go.

37:05.407 --> 37:06.873
Yeah.

37:06.875 --> 37:08.375
So, uh...

37:10.845 --> 37:12.913
It's me. Open up.

37:12.915 --> 37:15.048
Come on, Jack. I know you're in there.

37:15.050 --> 37:16.416
Go away.

37:16.418 --> 37:18.451
I'm with a woman!

37:18.453 --> 37:19.553
I'm Brittany.

37:19.555 --> 37:20.654
I'm here with Jack.

37:20.656 --> 37:23.657
So thank you. Leave us alone.

37:23.659 --> 37:25.725
Okay, open the door, Brittany.

37:25.727 --> 37:28.528
Oh, okay.

37:30.299 --> 37:31.331
So this is embarrassing.

37:31.333 --> 37:32.432
For both of us.

37:32.434 --> 37:34.434
Is that what I think it is?

37:34.436 --> 37:37.270
It is.

37:37.272 --> 37:38.905
Dumb door.

37:38.907 --> 37:42.809
<i>U.F.O. My gosh!</i>. Where did you find this?

37:42.811 --> 37:44.110
You don't look so good, Jack.

37:44.112 --> 37:45.345
How are you feeling?

37:45.347 --> 37:46.713
Oh, better now, thanks to this.

37:46.715 --> 37:49.649
Seriously. All the five seasons?

37:49.651 --> 37:52.852
- Score.
- Jack, have a seat.

37:52.854 --> 37:56.823
Let me see you.

37:56.825 --> 38:00.427
You're jaundiced,
and you're running a fever.

38:00.429 --> 38:02.429
Anything else?

38:05.266 --> 38:08.368
Does Dr. Greene know about this?

38:08.370 --> 38:09.836
Nope.

38:09.838 --> 38:11.471
You could jeopardize your health, Jack,

38:11.473 --> 38:13.640
and the others in the trial
by not reporting this.

38:13.642 --> 38:15.108
We need to get you to the hospital.

38:15.110 --> 38:18.111
Whoa, Hank, Hank.

38:18.113 --> 38:19.946
You remember when I flipped
the coin earlier

38:19.948 --> 38:21.248
in Nina's office?

38:21.250 --> 38:24.050
Mm-hmm.

38:24.052 --> 38:28.321
It didn't matter
if it ended up heads or tails.

38:28.323 --> 38:30.624
The clinical trial was always gonna win.

38:30.626 --> 38:32.659
Why is that?

38:32.661 --> 38:36.029
Because I heard what she said.

38:36.031 --> 38:39.399
In my mind, it all added up

38:39.401 --> 38:42.402
to one perfect thing... a silver bullet,

38:42.404 --> 38:44.304
something that would make
the lupus disappear

38:44.306 --> 38:47.674
and I would be done with it forever.

38:47.676 --> 38:50.210
I was going for the hole in one.

38:50.212 --> 38:55.448
So I aimed for the pin.

38:55.450 --> 38:57.784
And then, pfft.

38:57.786 --> 39:00.987
I shanked it out of bounds.

39:00.989 --> 39:02.689
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

39:02.691 --> 39:04.524
Yeah.

39:04.526 --> 39:08.495
Yeah, me too.

39:08.497 --> 39:09.763
But what we need to do now

39:09.765 --> 39:11.264
is get you out of this trial

39:11.266 --> 39:13.199
and to the E.R. so they
can treat these symptoms.

39:13.201 --> 39:16.403
I have a better idea.

39:16.405 --> 39:17.904
Oh.

39:17.906 --> 39:20.740
Heads, I'll go to the E.R.,

39:20.742 --> 39:22.575
but tails, I stay in the trial

39:22.577 --> 39:24.044
and you treat me here.

39:28.183 --> 39:29.616
You know what, Jack,

39:29.618 --> 39:32.686
no matter what you call,
the E.R.'s gonna win.

39:41.273 --> 39:43.440
You had a type III
hypersensitivity reaction

39:43.442 --> 39:45.042
to the nephrostatin.

39:45.044 --> 39:46.710
As a result, your liver
stopped functioning properly.

39:46.712 --> 39:48.445
It's fine now, but unfortunately

39:48.447 --> 39:49.747
it was a known risk in the trial.

39:49.749 --> 39:51.415
But if you were gonna suffer
any adverse affects,

39:51.417 --> 39:52.616
earlier's always better than later.

39:52.618 --> 39:54.652
Hank was right to bring you in, Jack.

39:54.654 --> 39:57.454
Had he not, you could have gone
into acute hepatic failure.

39:57.456 --> 39:58.556
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

39:58.558 --> 39:59.757
Acute hep... you know what?

39:59.759 --> 40:01.592
You guys should come with subtitles.

40:01.594 --> 40:02.827
Was there any good news in there?

40:02.829 --> 40:04.128
- Yeah.
- Oh.

40:04.130 --> 40:05.229
Go ahead.

40:05.231 --> 40:07.097
Well, the good news

40:07.099 --> 40:08.966
is that now you can start
with traditional treatments

40:08.968 --> 40:11.001
without any doubts or reservations.

40:11.003 --> 40:13.237
- What were you gonna say?
- The exact same thing.

40:13.239 --> 40:14.738
- Oh.
- "The exact same thing."

40:14.740 --> 40:16.207
"The exact same thing."

40:16.209 --> 40:17.208
So cute.

40:17.210 --> 40:18.542
You guys should go ahead

40:18.544 --> 40:19.910
and get a room, shouldn't you?

40:19.912 --> 40:21.178
You know what, actually,
I'm done with this one.

40:21.180 --> 40:22.313
Take mine.

40:22.315 --> 40:24.281
All right.
Any more questions before I go?

40:24.283 --> 40:27.451
Yeah.

40:27.453 --> 40:32.289
Just one, but it's important.

40:35.827 --> 40:38.195
What kind of treatment would I get

40:38.197 --> 40:40.664
if I lived on the planet West Anivoc?

40:43.902 --> 40:45.035
We'll talk later.

40:45.037 --> 40:46.837
I'm outta here.

40:49.241 --> 40:51.308
- It's her.
- It's not her.

40:51.310 --> 40:52.543
- It's definitely her.
- It's not.

40:52.545 --> 40:53.944
- So her.
- That's enough.

41:06.992 --> 41:08.359
Hey. Thought you might need

41:08.361 --> 41:09.960
some help getting out of the car.

41:09.962 --> 41:13.264
I told you, I'm fine.

41:13.266 --> 41:15.065
You took the drugs, didn't you?

41:15.067 --> 41:16.400
No.

41:16.402 --> 41:17.801
Admitting you took drugs when you were

41:17.803 --> 41:19.970
in pain does not make you
less of a man, Henry.

41:19.972 --> 41:21.605
All right, I took the drugs.

41:21.607 --> 41:22.640
You wuss.

41:22.642 --> 41:25.643
Ev...

41:25.645 --> 41:27.845
you were right to want
a contingency plan.

41:27.847 --> 41:29.380
We need it for times like this.

41:29.382 --> 41:32.283
I mean, having a backup doctor, a B.U.D.,

41:32.285 --> 41:34.251
makes good business sense.

41:34.253 --> 41:38.188
I'm happy you feel that way.

41:38.190 --> 41:39.790
But it's not always about the money.

41:39.792 --> 41:41.792
Who are you

41:41.794 --> 41:43.327
and what have you done with my brother?

41:43.329 --> 41:45.029
It's not.

41:45.031 --> 41:49.767
It's also about the level
of care we've established.

41:49.769 --> 41:51.702
You've established.

41:51.704 --> 41:54.038
Dr. Van Dyke,

41:54.040 --> 41:55.239
he's a good doctor.

41:55.241 --> 41:58.676
But he's... he's not you.

41:58.678 --> 42:03.514
So if I'm gonna look for another B.U.D.,

42:03.516 --> 42:06.884
I'll have my work cut out for me.
