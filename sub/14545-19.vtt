WEBVTT

00:02.670 --> 00:07.075
(Tessa) IN CHATSWIN,
THE GRASS REALLY IS GREENER...

00:07.108 --> 00:08.609
(The Cranberries' "Linger"
playing)

00:08.642 --> 00:09.777
THE FRUIT SWEETER...

00:09.810 --> 00:11.345
(crunch)

00:11.379 --> 00:13.847
THE VEGETABLES SNAPPIER.
(snapping)

00:13.881 --> 00:15.716
EVEN THE CORN SEEMS CRUNCHIER.

00:15.749 --> 00:17.351
IT'S A PRODUCE PARADISE,

00:17.385 --> 00:19.053
A VERITABLE GARDEN OF...

00:19.087 --> 00:20.754
EDEN.
NICE TO MEET YOU, FRANK.

00:20.788 --> 00:21.855
NICE TO MEET YOU.

00:21.889 --> 00:23.191
GORGEOUS BRAEBURNS.

00:23.224 --> 00:24.825
THANK YOU.
THEY REALLY ARE.

00:24.858 --> 00:27.395
AND SINCE WE'RE INTRODUCING
OURSELVES, I'M GEORGE ALTMAN.

00:27.428 --> 00:30.231
FRANK DE LUCA.
DE LUCA ORCHARDS, ROUTE 9.

00:30.264 --> 00:32.333
HELLO.
AND THIS IS EDEN.

00:32.366 --> 00:33.301
EDEN?

00:33.334 --> 00:34.535
APPLE, GEORGE?

00:34.568 --> 00:38.172
I'M TEMPTED, BUT, UH,
WON'T IT GET ME KICKED OUT?

00:38.206 --> 00:39.873
DON'T BE STUPID.
IT'S A FREE SAMPLE.

00:39.907 --> 00:41.575
WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN MAYBE
GRABBING A CUP OF COFFEE?

00:45.413 --> 00:46.780
I DON'T DRINK COFFEE.

00:46.814 --> 00:49.483
YOU KNOW, BETWEEN THE CHEMICALS,
PESTICIDES,

00:49.517 --> 00:51.352
AND EXPLOITATION OF WORKERS,

00:51.385 --> 00:53.121
IT'S BASICALLY THE DEVIL.

00:53.154 --> 00:54.222
BUT I'LL DO YOU ONE BETTER.

00:54.255 --> 00:58.392
BETTER?
THAN A CUP OF THE DEVIL?

00:58.426 --> 00:59.593
MY TREAT. WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE?

00:59.627 --> 01:03.431
OH. UH, UM, ALL RIGHT.
WELL...

01:03.464 --> 01:06.134
IT ALL LOOKS... TERRIBLE.
(chuckles)

01:06.167 --> 01:07.901
SORRY. I'M CLUELESS WHEN
IT COMES TO THIS HEALTH CRAP.

01:07.935 --> 01:09.770
YOU--YOU PICK.

01:09.803 --> 01:10.904
TWO KITCHEN SINKS

01:10.938 --> 01:13.674
WITH BEE POLLEN, ACIDOPHILUS,
AND EXTRA BREWER'S YEAST.

01:13.707 --> 01:15.509
AH! YES, EXTRA, PLEASE.

01:15.543 --> 01:17.478
NOTHING QUENCHES
LIKE A GOOD CUP OF YEAST.

01:17.511 --> 01:19.247
AM I RIGHT? (chuckles)

01:19.280 --> 01:20.281
ALL RIGHT.

01:20.314 --> 01:21.315
THANKS.
THANK YOU.

01:21.349 --> 01:22.550
MM-HMM.
AND THANK YOU.

01:22.583 --> 01:25.519
BUT JUST--JUST SO YOU KNOW, IF I
WASN'T TRYING TO IMPRESS YOU,

01:25.553 --> 01:27.521
THERE IS NO WAY
THIS WOULD TOUCH MY LIPS.

01:27.555 --> 01:30.458
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT.
OH.
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

01:30.491 --> 01:32.193
(slurps)

01:32.226 --> 01:33.561
OH.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.129
OH. OKAY, NOT BAD.

01:35.163 --> 01:35.663
RIGHT?

01:35.696 --> 01:37.765
IT TASTES LIKE...

01:37.798 --> 01:39.500
MY THROAT'S CLOSING.

01:39.533 --> 01:40.901
(strained voice)
MY THROAT'S CLOSING.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.636
(drink thuds)
(groans)

01:42.670 --> 01:44.672
I THINK YOU MIGHT BE ALLERGIC
TO SOMETHING IN THIS DRINK.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.540
(voice cracks) YOU THINK?
NETTLE JUICE.

01:46.574 --> 01:48.842
SOMEONE RUN
AND GET SOME NETTLE JUICE!

01:48.876 --> 01:50.244
(strained voice) CALL
AN AMBULANCE. I CAN'T BREATHE.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.282
I FEEL AWFUL.

01:54.315 --> 01:55.416
ME, TOO. (chuckles)

01:55.449 --> 01:57.285
I'VE NEVER SEEN SOMEONE
REACT LIKE THAT

01:57.318 --> 01:58.519
TO ALL-NATURAL INGREDIENTS.

01:58.552 --> 02:00.154
UH, WELL, I'M A NEW YORKER.
I'M SORRY, GEORGE.

02:00.188 --> 02:01.922
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE PUSHED YOU
INTO THAT SMOOTHIE.

02:01.955 --> 02:02.990
NO, IT'S--IT'S GOOD.

02:03.023 --> 02:06.494
I CONVULSED ON YOUR SHOULDER,
I WHEEZED IN YOUR LAP.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.296
I REALLY FEEL LIKE
WE KNOW EACH OTHER NOW.

02:08.329 --> 02:09.263
(knock on door)

02:09.297 --> 02:11.299
MR. FOREMAN?

02:11.332 --> 02:12.233
NO.

02:12.266 --> 02:13.901
GEORGE FOREMAN?

02:13.934 --> 02:14.935
"GEORGE FOREMAN"?

02:14.968 --> 02:16.003
WELL I COULDN'T REMEMBER,

02:16.036 --> 02:18.306
AND IT WAS THE FIRST GEORGE
THAT POPPED IN MY HEAD.

02:18.339 --> 02:21.542
LOOK, "GEORGE CUTE SMILE"
WASN'T GONNA GET YOUR TREATED.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.944
OKAY, MR. CUTE SMILE,
YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.879
WE'VE PRESCRIBED SOME
ANTIHISTAMINES AND AN EpiPen

02:25.913 --> 02:29.217
IN THE EVENT--
ANOTHER WOMAN TRIES
TO MAKE ME DRINK POISON?

02:29.250 --> 02:31.985
I'M AFRAID I CAN'T PRESCRIBE
ANYTHING FOR THE GOOGLY EYES,

02:32.019 --> 02:33.721
ALTHOUGH I'D LIKE TO
BECAUSE THEY'RE MAKING ME SICK.

02:36.424 --> 02:39.393
I'VE BEEN UP FOR 40 HOURS.

02:39.427 --> 02:40.494
SO THIS WAS FUN.

02:40.528 --> 02:40.994
(vomits)

02:41.028 --> 02:42.863
(chuckles)

02:42.896 --> 02:45.699
(laughs) ON OUR SECOND DATE,
I'LL SLAM YOUR HAND IN A DOOR.

02:45.733 --> 02:46.734
(laughs) SECOND DATE?

02:46.767 --> 02:51.539
THAT MEANS I GET ANOTHER BITE
OF THE APPLE, EDEN?

02:51.572 --> 02:53.841
CALL ME
WHEN YOUR FACE CLEARS UP.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.443
(chuckles)

02:55.476 --> 02:56.577
BYE.

02:56.610 --> 02:56.877
BYE.

03:00.281 --> 03:01.515
(giggles)

03:06.487 --> 03:08.389
SORRY.
I HAVE TO KISS YOU NOW.

03:17.498 --> 03:19.400
JUST REMOVED
AN 85-YEAR-OLD MAN'S CATHETER.

03:21.335 --> 03:24.472
Captioned by
Closed Captioning Services, Inc.

03:24.505 --> 03:29.443
(Alih Jay) * LAST NIGHT I HAD
A PLEASANT NIGHTMARE *

03:29.477 --> 03:32.480
* DA-DA-DA-DA,
DA, DA, DA, DA *

03:32.513 --> 03:33.614
(glass shatters)

03:33.647 --> 03:36.384
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE PEOPLE
BUY BROKEN SHARDS OF GLASS.

03:36.417 --> 03:37.217
THEY DON'T.

03:37.251 --> 03:39.587
THEY BUY
"CRYSTAL TEARS. FROM HEAVEN."

03:39.620 --> 03:40.821
(clinking)

03:40.854 --> 03:41.722
HEY.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.056
HEY, LISA.

03:43.090 --> 03:45.058
CAN I GET A HALF-POUND

03:45.092 --> 03:48.262
OF THE "CRYSTAL TEARS.
FROM HEAVEN"?

03:48.296 --> 03:50.298
AND ALSO, I NEED SOMETHING
FOR MALIK.

03:50.331 --> 03:53.401
IT'S OUR MONTH-AVERSARY,
SO IT NEEDS TO BE SPECIAL.

03:53.434 --> 03:54.568
MOMMY, I NEED MONEY.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.437
I'M WITH A CUSTOMER.
I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.038
LISA, DOES MALIK HAVE

03:58.071 --> 04:01.375
A HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGE OF YOU
SET IN CRYSTAL?

04:01.409 --> 04:03.477
I-I'M EMBARRASSED TO SAY NO.

04:03.511 --> 04:05.779
(glass shards crunch)

04:05.813 --> 04:07.381
YOU JUST WALKED
STRAIGHT THROUGH MY PILE.

04:07.415 --> 04:08.816
YOUR "PILE" ISN'T MY PROBLEM.

04:08.849 --> 04:11.485
NO, I AGREE. YOU HAVE
MUCH MORE SERIOUS PROBLEMS

04:11.519 --> 04:12.720
THAT PREDATE THIS PILE.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.822
YOU CAN'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT.
I'M YOUR BOSS.

04:14.855 --> 04:16.524
I WORK FOR YOU MOTHER,
NOT YOU.

04:16.557 --> 04:17.658
I CAME OUT OF MY MOTHER.

04:17.691 --> 04:18.992
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS.

04:19.026 --> 04:20.561
TESSA, YOU'RE FIRED.
WANNA BET?

04:20.594 --> 04:22.863
MOMMY, I JUST FIRED TESSA
WITHOUT SEVERANCE.

04:22.896 --> 04:25.699
WHAT?!
DALIA, WHAT HAS GOTTEN INTO YOU?

04:25.733 --> 04:27.368
TESSA'S NOT FIRED.

04:27.401 --> 04:30.471
BUT LOOK. SHE DID
A TERRIBLE JOB SWEEPING.

04:30.504 --> 04:31.505
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW, DALIA?

04:31.539 --> 04:34.708
YOU'VE NEVER SWEPT A DAY
IN YOUR LIFE.

04:34.742 --> 04:37.645
YOU KNOW WHAT, MOMMY?
YOU CAN FORGET THE MONEY.

04:37.678 --> 04:39.747
I DON'T EVEN WANT IT ANYMORE.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.082
(shards crunch and tinkle)

04:42.115 --> 04:42.383
OKAY, WHAT ABOUT A REPTILE?

04:44.818 --> 04:45.886
TOO COLD?

04:45.919 --> 04:49.056
MNH.

04:49.089 --> 04:50.658
HOW ABOUT A PARROT?

04:50.691 --> 04:52.860
THEY'RE CLEVER.
THEY CAN TALK.

04:52.893 --> 04:56.029
NOT EVERYTHING THAT TALKS
IS CLEVER.

04:56.063 --> 04:57.365
I JUST THINK
THAT HAVING A PET

04:57.398 --> 04:59.533
WOULD MAKE US FEEL
MORE LIKE A FAMILY.

04:59.567 --> 05:00.901
(sighs)
ROOMMATES SHOULDN'T HAVE PETS.

05:00.934 --> 05:02.370
WHAT IF ONE ROOMMATE
MOVES OUT?

05:02.403 --> 05:03.737
THEN THE PET
HAS TO CHOOSE SIDES.

05:03.771 --> 05:05.806
"ROOMMATES"?
THAT'S ANOTHER THING.

05:05.839 --> 05:08.342
WHY DO YOU INSIST
ON CALLING US ROOMMATES?

05:08.376 --> 05:09.410
(dishes thud)

05:09.443 --> 05:10.811
AND HOW COME YOU ALWAYS PUT
AN EMPTY SEAT BETWEEN US

05:10.844 --> 05:11.912
AT THE MOVIE THEATER?

05:11.945 --> 05:14.882
FOR POPCORN. I-I'VE TOLD YOU,
THAT'S THE POPCORN SEAT.

05:14.915 --> 05:17.117
I FEEL LIKE
YOU ARE ASHAMED OF US.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.185
AND SAYING NO TO A PET

05:18.218 --> 05:21.555
IS JUST YOUR WAY OF SAYING NO
TO A REAL COMMITMENT.

05:21.589 --> 05:23.557
(sighs) LOOK,
NORA AND I HAD A CAT.

05:23.591 --> 05:25.493
AFTER THE DIVORCE--
YOU ALWAYS BRING UP NORA

05:25.526 --> 05:28.529
WHENEVER I TRY TO TALK
ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP.

05:28.562 --> 05:30.831
I'M NOT NORA!
WELL, HOW ABOUT WE GET
AN AREA RUG?

05:30.864 --> 05:34.802
IF THINGS DON'T WORK OUT,
WE CAN ALWAYS CUT THAT IN HALF.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.137
I'M TELLING YOU, MAN,
THAT KISS TOOK MY BREATH AWAY.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.507
NOAH, I HAVE NOT FELT
A CONNECTION LIKE THIS

05:39.540 --> 05:41.875
SINCE...
WELL, MAYBE EVER.

05:41.909 --> 05:45.579
(laughs) LOOK,
I DON'T WANNA ONE-UP YA...

05:45.613 --> 05:46.514
(pool cue clatters)

05:46.547 --> 05:47.615
BUT I'M GONNA.

05:47.648 --> 05:50.418
JILL AND I ARE EXPECTING.

05:50.451 --> 05:51.051
A BABY?!

05:51.084 --> 05:52.586
A BABY, MAN!
(claps hands)

05:52.620 --> 05:54.888
A GOO-GOO GA-GA BABY.

05:54.922 --> 05:56.189
(laughs) OF COURSE,
WE NEEDED SOME HELP.

05:56.223 --> 05:57.458
JILL IS OF A CERTAIN AGE.

05:57.491 --> 05:58.859
BUT SHE'S ALL RIGHT?
SHE'S FEELING GOOD?

05:58.892 --> 05:59.960
SHE'S AMAZING.

05:59.993 --> 06:02.195
(laughs)
(laughs)

06:02.229 --> 06:03.196
OKAY!
WELL...

06:03.230 --> 06:04.665
ALL RIGHT! WOW!
(laughing)

06:04.698 --> 06:06.900
THAT'S GREAT, MAN!
LOOK AT US, HUH?

06:06.934 --> 06:08.869
IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE...

06:08.902 --> 06:11.104
I DON'T KNOW...
STARTING OVER.

06:11.138 --> 06:13.574
LET'S HAVE DINNER TOMORROW NIGHT
TO CELEBRATE, ALL RIGHT?

06:13.607 --> 06:17.210
WE CAN MEET YOUR NEW LADY,
AND WE CAN TOAST MY SEED.

06:17.244 --> 06:18.011
HUH?

06:18.045 --> 06:20.013
UP TOP! COME ON!

06:20.047 --> 06:22.783
(sizzling)

06:22.816 --> 06:24.151
SMELLS LIKE BURNT RUBBER.

06:24.184 --> 06:26.420
YEP, THAT'S WHAT I'M MAKING YOU
FOR DINNER--BURNT RUBBER--

06:26.454 --> 06:27.521
'CAUSE I'M GOING OUT.

06:27.555 --> 06:29.923
ARE YOU JUST STIR-FRYING
THE NONSTICK COATING OR WHAT?

06:29.957 --> 06:31.825
(door opens)
(Dallas) MY BABY'S MISSING!

06:31.859 --> 06:32.793
(panting)
(George) WHAT?

06:32.826 --> 06:35.162
MY BABY'S MISSING!
SHE'S GONE!

06:35.195 --> 06:37.197
NO ONE WOULD KIDNAP DALIA.
DID SHE RUN AWAY?

06:37.230 --> 06:39.867
NOT DALIA! YAKULT!

06:39.900 --> 06:40.734
(groans)
OH.

06:40.768 --> 06:42.202
YAKULT'S MISSING!
SHE'S MISSING, Y'ALL!

06:42.235 --> 06:43.003
I'VE LOOKED EVERYWHERE--

06:43.036 --> 06:45.072
INSIDE THE HOUSE,
OUTSIDE THE HOUSE,

06:45.105 --> 06:47.107
INSIDE THE GUESTHOUSE,
OUTSIDE THE GUESTHOUSE,

06:47.140 --> 06:49.142
INSIDE THE POOL CABANA,
OUTSIDE THE POOL CABANA.

06:49.176 --> 06:53.213
SHE'S GONE! (gasps) OH!
I CAN'T BREATHE!

06:53.246 --> 06:54.915
(gasps) I CAN'T FIND BREATH.
DALLAS?

06:54.948 --> 06:58.619
DON'T TOUCH ME! DON'T TOUCH ME!
I FEEL CONFINED!

06:58.652 --> 06:59.787
(breathing heavily) IF SOMETHING
HAPPENS TO THAT DOG,

06:59.820 --> 07:01.622
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'LL DO.

07:01.655 --> 07:03.491
(clears throat)
I DON'T KNOW HOW I'LL PRESS ON.

07:03.524 --> 07:04.391
I WON'T!

07:04.424 --> 07:06.894
OKAY, D-DALLAS, HEY,
YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN

07:06.927 --> 07:09.162
AND SIT AND TELL US
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.

07:09.196 --> 07:11.732
I'M SURE YAKULT IS OKAY.
WE'LL PUT UP FLIERS.

07:11.765 --> 07:14.167
TESSA, YOU HAVE TO FIND MY GIRL.
PROMISE ME.

07:14.201 --> 07:16.103
SHE'S OUT THERE ALONE!

07:16.136 --> 07:20.007
WHAT WILL SHE EAT COME DINNER?
WHERE WILL SHE SLEEP COME NIGHT?

07:20.040 --> 07:22.142
WHERE, TESSA?

07:22.175 --> 07:24.044
HEY! SORRY WE'RE LATE.

07:24.077 --> 07:24.745
HEY!

07:24.778 --> 07:26.514
MILADY WAS
BLOW-DRYING HER HAIR

07:26.547 --> 07:28.048
FOR THREE-QUARTERS
OF AN HOUR.

07:28.081 --> 07:29.750
(chuckles) HEY.
HERE YOU GO.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.251
OH. WHY, THANK YOU, GEORGE.
WELL, OF COURSE.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.621
HEY. HEY, WHAT IS THIS?
YOU TRYING TO STEAL MY GAL?

07:33.654 --> 07:35.623
(laughs)
(laughs) WHERE'S YOURS?

07:35.656 --> 07:37.758
OH, SHE SHOULD BE HERE
ANY MINUTE, HOPEFULLY.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.760
I'M STARTING TO THINK
SHE GOT COLD FEET.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.562
HEY, YOU THINK IT WAS TOO SOON
TO DO A DOUBLE DATE?

07:41.595 --> 07:42.930
DID I MESS UP?

07:42.963 --> 07:45.032
CAN I START YOU OFF WITH
SOME COCKTAILS THIS EVENING?

07:45.065 --> 07:47.034
I'LL HAVE A SCOTCH. NEAT.

07:47.067 --> 07:49.002
REALLY? IS--IS THAT ALLOWED?

07:49.036 --> 07:50.738
I'M GONNA HAVE A LEMON DROP,

07:50.771 --> 07:52.740
UH, AND SUGAR UP THE RIM FOR ME,
ANGEL.

07:52.773 --> 07:55.543
WE'RE CELEBRATIN' TONIGHT.
(chuckles)

07:55.576 --> 07:56.176
THANK YOU.

07:56.209 --> 07:57.711
SO... HOW FAR ALONG ARE YOU?

07:57.745 --> 08:00.881
I GOTTA TELL YOU, JILL,
YOU BARELY LOOK PREGNANT.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.149
PREGNANT?

08:02.182 --> 08:03.584
I LOOK PREGNANT?

08:03.617 --> 08:04.351
Y--AM I MISSING SOMETHING?

08:04.384 --> 08:05.586
ISN'T THAT WHAT
WE'RE CELEBRATING?

08:05.619 --> 08:06.720
YOU TOLD ME SHE WAS PREGNANT.

08:06.754 --> 08:09.056
I TOLD YOU WE WERE
HAVING A BABY.
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

08:09.089 --> 08:11.692
GEORGE, WE HIRED A SURROGATE
TO CARRY THE BABY FOR ME.

08:11.725 --> 08:12.860
I WANTED TO CARRY IT MYSELF,

08:12.893 --> 08:14.928
BUT I'M SIMPLY TOO BUSY
WITH MY NEW BOOK,

08:14.962 --> 08:17.197
"MAKING TIME FOR WHAT MATTERS."

08:17.230 --> 08:19.567
(sighs) YOU NEVER MENTIONED
A SURROGATE.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.870
SHE'S FARM-RAISED, SUN-KISSED,
AND COMPLETELY ORGANIC.

08:22.903 --> 08:25.272
UTERINE WALLS OF CONCRETE.
(Jill) MM.

08:25.305 --> 08:32.646
(Noah, Jill, and George)
OH, THERE SHE IS.

08:32.680 --> 08:36.249
(car door closes,
indistinct conversations)

08:36.283 --> 08:38.318
WELL, THE CONVERSATION
MAY HAVE RUN DRY,

08:38.351 --> 08:43.256
BUT MY SWORDFISH WAS
EXCEPTIONALLY MOIST.

08:43.290 --> 08:44.658
EXCEPTIONALLY.

08:44.692 --> 08:46.259
LOOK...

08:46.293 --> 08:48.028
THIS IS SILLY.

08:48.061 --> 08:50.798
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS ONLY HAD
ONE DATE.

08:50.831 --> 08:52.032
GEORGE DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE PREGNANT.

08:52.065 --> 08:55.268
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT
GEORGE WAS MY BEST FRIEND.

08:55.302 --> 08:59.006
AND NOW THAT WE ALL KNOW
WHAT WE KNOW, IT'S OVER.

08:59.039 --> 09:03.176
WE CAN ALL PUT THIS
UNCOMFORTABLE MESS BEHIND US.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.045
IS THAT HOW YOU FEEL,
GEORGE,

09:05.078 --> 09:08.048
THAT IS AN UNCOMFORTABLE MESS
THAT WE SHOULD PUT BEHIND US?

09:08.081 --> 09:09.583
(chuckles) I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S A MESS,

09:09.617 --> 09:10.017
BUT I CERTAINLY AM
UNCOMFORTABLE.

09:14.622 --> 09:17.024
GOOD-BYE, GEORGE FOREMAN.

09:17.057 --> 09:17.625
IT WAS NICE
ALMOST KNOWING YOU.

09:24.297 --> 09:26.299
COME ON.

09:26.333 --> 09:29.703
YOU CANNOT DATE A WOMAN
THAT HAS MY BABY INSIDE OF HER.

09:29.737 --> 09:30.671
(chuckles) COME ON.

09:30.704 --> 09:32.239
I KNOW I'M PREACHING
TO THE CHOIR HERE. RIGHT?

09:32.272 --> 09:34.642
(chuckles)

09:34.675 --> 09:35.976
RIGHT?

09:36.009 --> 09:37.678
(car door opens)
YEAH.

09:37.711 --> 09:43.717
(closes car door)

09:43.751 --> 09:45.619
SHE DIDN'T EVEN
LOOK PREGNANT.

09:45.653 --> 09:49.289
DID SHE LOOK PREGNANT
TO YOU?

09:49.322 --> 09:52.893
THAT'S THE PHOTO YOU CHOSE?
SHE LOOKS HAGGARD.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.762
WHY COULDN'T YOU PICK ONE
OF HER SMILING?

09:54.795 --> 09:57.364
YAKULT HAS
A BEAUTIFUL SMILE.

09:57.397 --> 09:59.132
IS THAT A SECURITY CAMERA?

09:59.166 --> 10:00.901
YEAH. STEVEN HAD IT INSTALLED
TO MAKE SURE

10:00.934 --> 10:02.936
EVERYONE TOOK OFF THEIR SHOES
WHEN THEY CAME IN THE HOUSE.

10:02.970 --> 10:05.438
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU RECALL,
BUT HE HAD A REAL SHOE THING.

10:05.472 --> 10:07.675
IT WAS KINDA
HIS DEFINING CHARACTERISTIC.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.743
IS IT RECORDING?
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S RECORDING.

10:09.777 --> 10:11.278
OH, MY GOSH,
IT'S ALWAYS RECORDING.

10:11.311 --> 10:12.646
(gasps)

10:12.680 --> 10:14.281
OH, MY GOSH,
IT'S ALWAYS RECORDING!

10:14.314 --> 10:17.951
TO THE CONTROL ROOM!

10:17.985 --> 10:21.689
(hangers whoosh)

10:21.722 --> 10:23.023
DON'T SEE A LOT OF THOSE
ANYMORE.

10:23.056 --> 10:24.091
AT THE TIME,

10:24.124 --> 10:26.960
JOYSTICK-BASED SECURITY WAS
CONSIDERED CUTTING-EDGE.

10:26.994 --> 10:30.163
(laser firing)
THIS MODEL
CAME WITH "ASTEROIDS."

10:30.197 --> 10:31.431
(beeps)

10:31.464 --> 10:34.367
(Dallas) LET'S JUST CHECK
SOME OLD FOOTAGE.

10:34.401 --> 10:35.736
(Dalia speaks inaudibly)

10:35.769 --> 10:38.672
THERE'S YAKULT RIGHT THERE!

10:38.706 --> 10:39.973
WHAT IS SHE DOIN'?

10:40.007 --> 10:42.475
DID--DID SHE JUST...

10:42.509 --> 10:45.478
(gasps)

10:45.512 --> 10:46.179
DALIA OPRAH ROYCE,
GET DOWN HERE RIGHT NOW!

10:50.383 --> 10:51.852
I'M INVERTED!

10:51.885 --> 10:53.821
I SAID, GET DOWN HERE NOW!

10:53.854 --> 10:55.055
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

10:55.088 --> 10:57.758
MY OW DAUGHTER,
MY OW FLESH AND BLOOD.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.259
WHAT, MOMMY?
I JUST GOT UPSIDE DOWN.

10:59.292 --> 11:01.228
YOU SWEPT YAKULT.

11:01.261 --> 11:02.262
I DID NOT.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.297
WE JUST WATCHED YOU DO SO
ON SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE.

11:04.331 --> 11:07.067
YOU SWEPT THAT POOR,
INNOCENT DOG! HOW COULD YOU?

11:07.100 --> 11:09.069
YOU THOUGHT IT WAS SO GREAT
WHEN TESSA SWEPT.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.338
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE MY CHILD.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I HAVE RAISED

11:11.371 --> 11:13.440
SUCH A SELFISH,
VINDICTIVE LITTLE GIRL.

11:13.473 --> 11:19.146
YOU BETTER PRAY THAT DOG
IS UNHARMED, OR ELSE... (sighs)

11:19.179 --> 11:21.214
TESSA..

11:21.248 --> 11:23.250
THANK YOU FOR BEING WHO YOU ARE.

11:23.283 --> 11:24.417
SOMEBODY RAISED YOU RIGHT,
AND CLEARLY, IT WASN'T ME.

11:44.137 --> 11:46.106
(whimpers)

11:46.139 --> 11:46.840
ALAN!

11:46.874 --> 11:48.341
COME QUICKLY AND SEE!

11:48.375 --> 11:50.410
WHAT--WHAT'S WRONG? I WAS JUST
ABOUT TO GET IN THE SHOWER.

11:50.443 --> 11:52.379
I WAS OUT BUYING AN AREA RUG,
JUST LIKE YOU SAID--

11:52.412 --> 11:54.414
LOW PILE, MODERN, GEOMETRIC--

11:54.447 --> 11:57.517
WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,
I FELT SOMETHING LICK ME...

11:57.550 --> 11:58.485
IN THE HEART.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.788
I TURNED AROUND TO FIND THIS.

12:00.821 --> 12:02.022
YOU WENT OUT AND GOT A DOG?

12:02.055 --> 12:04.324
ABSOLUTELY NOT. HE GOT ME.

12:04.357 --> 12:06.326
OR MORE SPECIFICALLY, US.

12:06.359 --> 12:10.430
THIS DOG WAS SENT HERE, ALAN,
TO MAKE US A FAMILY.

12:10.463 --> 12:15.235
JUST LOOK
AT THOSE PRETTY BROWN EYES.

12:15.268 --> 12:17.470
(laughing)

12:17.504 --> 12:20.573
ALL RIGHT, I JUST
GOT LICKED, TOO. (laughs)

12:20.607 --> 12:22.075
WELL, NOW THE TWO OF US
GET TO PUT OUR HEADS TOGETHER

12:22.109 --> 12:23.343
AND COME UP
WITH A GREAT NAME.

12:23.376 --> 12:26.346
I ALREADY NAMED HIM.
HIS NAME IS HANSON.

12:26.379 --> 12:27.981
(Hanson)
* MMM BOP, BA DUBA DOP

12:28.015 --> 12:30.117
* BA DUBA DOP,
BA DUBA DOP *

12:30.150 --> 12:32.252
* BA DUBA DOP, BA DUBA DOP

12:32.285 --> 12:33.987
* BA DU

12:34.021 --> 12:35.055
* YEAH, YEAH

12:35.088 --> 12:36.857
* MMM BOP, BA DUBA DOP

12:36.890 --> 12:38.792
* BA DUBA DOP

12:38.826 --> 12:41.094
(lowered voice)
DEEP CLEANSING BREATH.

12:41.128 --> 12:41.929
(Noah in distance)
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

12:41.962 --> 12:43.563
SHE JUST TOOK
A DEEP CLEANSING BREATH.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.398
GUYS, JUST COME IN.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.567
I CAN HEAR YOU.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.037
(Noah and Jill, singsongy) HI.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.172
WE'D JUST LIKE TO TOUCH BASE
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

12:52.205 --> 12:55.308
TO SUM UP, GEORGE--
NOT THE MAN WE THOUGHT HE WAS.

12:55.342 --> 12:58.045
NOAH--
DIDN'T HANDLE THINGS GREAT.

12:58.078 --> 13:00.613
I DON'T HANDLE THINGS GREAT.

13:00.647 --> 13:02.315
(laughs) I DON'T.

13:02.349 --> 13:04.184
WE JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO FEEL
ANY RESENTMENT.

13:04.217 --> 13:06.987
YEAH, BECAUSE THAT RESENTMENT
WILL FLOW THROUGH YOUR BODY

13:07.020 --> 13:08.255
AND DRENCH OUR FETUS.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.489
GUYS,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.391
THERE'S NOTHING HAPPENING
BETWEEN GEORGE AND ME.

13:11.424 --> 13:13.393
YES!

13:13.426 --> 13:16.196
I'M SORRY YOU'RE ALONE.

13:16.229 --> 13:18.465
NAMASTE.

13:18.498 --> 13:20.868
(Dalia) YOU GUYS, WE NEED
TO FIGURE OUT WHERE YAKULT IS

13:20.901 --> 13:21.935
SO I CAN BRING HER BACK
TO MOMMY

13:21.969 --> 13:25.338
SO SHE WON'T BE SAD
AND MAD AT ME.

13:25.372 --> 13:35.415
YOU GUYS, WE SERIOUSLY NEED
TO BRAINSTORM, YOU GUYS.

13:35.415 --> 13:42.856
YOU GUYS, WE SERIOUSLY NEED
TO BRAINSTORM, YOU GUYS.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.557
WHAT WAS THAT, KIMANTHA?

13:44.591 --> 13:46.026
NOTHING.

13:46.059 --> 13:47.060
NO, I-I JUST...

13:47.094 --> 13:49.129
I SHIFTED MY WEIGHT
FROM MY LEFT FOOT TO MY RIGHT.

13:49.162 --> 13:52.365
OHH. GOOD IDEA.

13:52.399 --> 13:55.068
(indistinct conversations)

13:55.102 --> 13:59.172
WORD ON THE PADDLE COURTS
IS NOAH KNOCKED UP YOUR LADY.

13:59.206 --> 14:00.874
ARE YOU HOMESCHOOLED OR WHAT?

14:00.908 --> 14:02.976
HEY, YOU THINK YOU'RE
THE FIRST FELLA TO FALL FOR

14:03.010 --> 14:06.079
A BIRD WITH SOMEONE ELSE'S EGG
IN HER NEST?

14:06.113 --> 14:07.915
LOOK AT HEIDI KLUM AND SEAL.

14:07.948 --> 14:10.350
SHE HAD SOMEONE ELSE'S BUN IN
THE OVEN, JUST LIKE YOUR GIRL.

14:10.383 --> 14:11.451
ALL RIGHT,
SO WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

14:11.484 --> 14:13.320
SARAH JESSICA PARKER USED
A SURROGATE.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.055
IF BRODERICK CAN DEAL,
SO CAN YOU.

14:15.088 --> 14:15.889
ALL RIGHT, FOR THE RECORD,

14:15.923 --> 14:17.690
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH SURROGACY.

14:17.724 --> 14:20.460
I'M JUST TRYING TO...
WRAP MY HEAD AROUND THE IDEA

14:20.493 --> 14:22.963
OF DATING SOMEONE
WHO'S CARRYING A BABY--

14:22.996 --> 14:24.564
JILL AND NOAH'S BABY.

14:24.597 --> 14:26.299
IT'S...

14:26.333 --> 14:28.301
IT'S COMPLICATED, A.J.

14:28.335 --> 14:29.369
EVEN YOU MUST SEE THAT.

14:29.402 --> 14:30.337
CHALK UP YOUR TIP, GEORGE,

14:30.370 --> 14:32.705
AND YOU'LL HAVE BETTER CONTROL
OVER YOUR BALLS.

14:32.739 --> 14:33.907
(slurps)

14:33.941 --> 14:35.208
(slurps)
MR. WOLFE?

14:35.242 --> 14:36.910
CAN YOU MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT
AT THE ASSEMBLY?

14:36.944 --> 14:38.311
(gasps)
A FRIEND OF MINE LOST HER DOG.

14:38.345 --> 14:40.380
UM, IS--IS THAT THE DOG?

14:40.413 --> 14:42.715
YEAH. HER NAME'S YAKULT.

14:42.749 --> 14:46.219
YAKULT? THAT DOG DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE A "YAKULT" TO ME.

14:46.253 --> 14:48.455
HAVE YOU SEEN HER?
NO. NO, I CERTAINLY HAVE NOT.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.390
(school bell rings)
TESSA...

14:50.423 --> 14:54.161
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE
IN FORENSIC SCIENCE RIGHT NOW?

14:54.194 --> 14:59.967
WHY, YES, I AM.

15:00.000 --> 15:08.675
YES... I... AM.

15:08.708 --> 15:11.011
(panting)
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, MAN,
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.980
I MADE A DECISION.
I WANNA BE SEAL.

15:13.013 --> 15:14.581
NOT HOW HE IS NOW,
BUT HOW HE WAS THEN.

15:14.614 --> 15:16.216
AND I WANT YOU
TO BE OKAY WITH IT.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.684
BUDDY, I LOVE YOU,
BUT YOU'RE NO SEAL.

15:17.717 --> 15:19.586
OKAY, HE'S MY DESKTOP IMAGE.
OKAY?

15:19.619 --> 15:22.222
AND I RAN INTO HIM ONCE
AT A D'AGOSTINO'S.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.256
SO...

15:23.290 --> 15:26.159
NOAH, I WANNA SEE EDEN,
AND I WANT YOUR BLESSING.

15:26.193 --> 15:28.962
ALL RIGHT, I DON'T WANT
TO BE A HARD-ASS ABOUT THIS,

15:28.996 --> 15:31.064
BUT I STRICTLY FORBID IT!

15:31.098 --> 15:33.333
LOOK, I KNOW, YOU'RE CAUGHT UP
ON THE SEX STUFF,

15:33.366 --> 15:34.434
BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.603
I JUST... I JUST LIKE HER,
YOU KNOW?

15:36.636 --> 15:39.106
I... I CAN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT HER.

15:39.139 --> 15:40.507
SO YOU'LL KEEP IT PLATONIC?

15:40.540 --> 15:41.774
(chuckles) I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

15:41.808 --> 15:45.578
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF
JILL AND I WANTED TO HAVE SEX

15:45.612 --> 15:47.080
ON TOP OF TESSA?

15:47.114 --> 15:48.381
THAT'S NOT THE SAME THING.

15:48.415 --> 15:50.683
I HOPE YOU KNOW THAT.

15:50.717 --> 15:52.485
I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY.

15:52.519 --> 15:54.221
I WANT YOU TO
BE HAPPY, TOO, MAN.

15:54.254 --> 15:56.756
OKAY, LET'S MAKE A DEAL.

15:56.789 --> 15:59.126
ALL RIGHT, YOU KEEP
ALL THE PHYSICAL STUFF

15:59.159 --> 16:03.563
ON THE BACK BURNER
UNTIL MY BABY IS BIRTHED,

16:03.596 --> 16:07.334
AND I'LL BE
COMPLETELY SUPPORTIVE.

16:07.367 --> 16:10.170
OKAY, SHE'LL NEVER
TAKE YOU BACK. (laughs)

16:10.203 --> 16:13.506
COME ON, BUDDY!

16:13.540 --> 16:15.608
YAKULT'S
IN THAT WELFARE HOTEL?

16:15.642 --> 16:18.678
THAT'S NOT A WELFARE HOTEL.
IT'S A CONDOMINIUM.

16:18.711 --> 16:21.248
JUST TRUST ME.

16:21.281 --> 16:23.783
I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU.

16:23.816 --> 16:24.817
I THINK YOU KNEW
I WAS GROUNDED,

16:24.851 --> 16:27.520
SO YOU LIED SO YOU COULD
LURE ME INTO EAST CHATSWIN

16:27.554 --> 16:28.788
SO YOU COULD MURDER ME

16:28.821 --> 16:31.091
SO YOU COULD GET PLASTIC SURGERY
SO YOU COULD ASSUME MY IDENTITY

16:31.124 --> 16:33.360
SO YOU COULD BE COOL.

16:33.393 --> 16:35.595
YAKULT ISN'T EVEN HERE.

16:35.628 --> 16:36.796
OH, MY GOD. THERE SHE IS.

16:36.829 --> 16:41.834
(jazz playing)

16:41.868 --> 16:52.079
(gate opens)

16:52.079 --> 17:02.089
(gate opens)

17:45.832 --> 17:55.875
(elevator bell dings)

17:55.875 --> 18:03.583
(elevator bell dings)

18:03.616 --> 18:05.785
MR. WOLFE! STOP!

18:05.818 --> 18:06.919
YOU DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING!

18:06.953 --> 18:08.255
THAT'S MY MOM'S DOG.

18:08.288 --> 18:10.623
NO, IT ISN'T.
THIS IS HANSON.

18:10.657 --> 18:11.658
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

18:11.691 --> 18:13.493
ALAN, THEY'RE TRYING TO TAKE
OUR DOG!

18:13.526 --> 18:15.228
UM...
THAT IS THE ROYCES' DOG!

18:15.262 --> 18:17.130
HER NAME IS YAKULT.

18:17.164 --> 18:17.997
SHE IS NOT HANSON.

18:18.030 --> 18:21.301
SHE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE
A BOY PART. LOOK.

18:21.334 --> 18:24.937
SHE DOESN'T HAVE A BOY PART.

18:24.971 --> 18:26.306
(gasping)

18:26.339 --> 18:27.307
OH.
HANSON!

18:27.340 --> 18:29.309
THIS IS EXACTLY WHY
I DIDN'T WANT TO GET A DOG.

18:29.342 --> 18:31.644
I GUESS
MAYBE YOU WERE RIGHT.

18:31.678 --> 18:33.413
NO, NO, I-I WAS WRONG.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.582
GOD, ALAN,
YOU'RE SO CONTRARY!

18:35.615 --> 18:36.549
WH-- (sighs)

18:36.583 --> 18:39.486
I THINK WHAT YOU AND HANSON
HAVE TAUGHT ME IS,

18:39.519 --> 18:41.721
YOU CAN'T NOT GET A DOG
FOREVER.

18:41.754 --> 18:45.758
SOONER OR LATER, SOMEONE'S GONNA
COME ALONG AND LICK YOUR HEART,

18:45.792 --> 18:47.727
THE WAY YOU LICKED MINE.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.697
SO IF YOU WANT A NEW DOG,

18:50.730 --> 18:52.299
I'M OPEN TO IT NOW.

18:52.332 --> 18:54.634
BUT YOU SAID
THAT ROOMMATES SHOULDN'T--
WE'RE NOT ROOMMATES.

18:54.667 --> 18:57.470
(sighs)

18:57.504 --> 18:59.872
WE'RE HOMOSEXUAL LOVERS,

18:59.906 --> 19:03.810
AND IT'S TIME I STARTED
ACTING LIKE ONE.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.278
CAN YOU GUYS WAIT
TILL WE LEAVE?

19:05.312 --> 19:06.179
WELL, PART OF THE PROBLEM WAS

19:06.213 --> 19:09.582
I DIDN'T SHOW MR. WOLFE
PUBLIC AFFECTION,

19:09.616 --> 19:10.783
SO, NO.

19:10.817 --> 19:11.584
MMM!

19:11.618 --> 19:14.621
OKAY, WE'RE GONNA GO.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.489
(moaning)

19:16.523 --> 19:18.191
(San Cisco's "Golden Revolver"
playing)

19:18.225 --> 19:25.532
**

19:33.940 --> 19:36.343
BUT THESE ARE
ALL HOMOSEXUAL BOY CLOTHES.

19:36.376 --> 19:39.546
YAKULT WAS LIVING AS
A GAY MALE DOG IN EAST CHATSWIN.

19:39.579 --> 19:41.981
I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH,
TESSA.

19:42.014 --> 19:45.852
IT REALLY WASN'T ME.
IT WAS DALIA.

19:45.885 --> 19:46.953
DALIA?

19:46.986 --> 19:49.256
SHE'S THE ONE
WHO SPOTTED YAKULT.

19:49.289 --> 19:50.323
GOOD EYES.

19:50.357 --> 19:52.892
SHE GETS THAT FROM MY SIDE.
STEVEN HAS ASTIGMATISM.

19:52.925 --> 19:54.894
I'M SORRY I SWEPT, MOMMY.

19:54.927 --> 19:57.364
I PROMISE
I'LL NEVER SWEEP AGAIN.

19:57.397 --> 20:02.335
FROM NOW ON, I'LL LEAVE ALL THAT
UP TO CARMEN, OKAY?

20:02.369 --> 20:05.672
OKAY.

20:05.705 --> 20:06.773
(barks)

20:06.806 --> 20:08.775
OH, MY GOD!
IT'S LIKE YOU CAN'T STAND

20:08.808 --> 20:11.844
IF SOMEONE ELSE GET ATTENTION
FOR TWO SECONDS, YAKULT!

20:11.878 --> 20:15.315
WE GET IT!
IT'S YOUR BIG DAY!

20:15.348 --> 20:16.516
(speaks indistinctly)

20:16.549 --> 20:18.385
FRANK, YOU HAVE
ANY OLIVE BRANCHES?

20:18.418 --> 20:20.420
I THINK YOU KNOW DAMN WELL
I DON'T.

20:20.453 --> 20:23.490
EDEN, WAIT. I'M SORRY.
LOOK, HEAR ME OUT, PLEASE.

20:23.523 --> 20:25.658
GEORGE, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO EXPLAIN. I GET IT.

20:25.692 --> 20:27.994
YOU KNOW,
IT'S A WEIRD SITUATION,

20:28.027 --> 20:30.730
AND YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE.
DIDN'T WORK OUT.

20:30.763 --> 20:33.466
WELL...
(singsongy) IT SUCKS.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.668
I KNOW I ACTED--
NARROW-MINDED.

20:35.702 --> 20:37.304
YEAH.

20:37.337 --> 20:39.806
I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT
FROM YOU.

20:39.839 --> 20:40.807
KIND OF BLOWS.

20:40.840 --> 20:44.411
WELL, WHICH IS IT?
DOES IT SUCK OR DOES IT BLOW?

20:44.444 --> 20:45.845
BOTH.

20:45.878 --> 20:49.749
EDEN, I'VE NEVER BEEN
IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS BEFORE.

20:49.782 --> 20:52.285
I DON'T... EXACTLY KNOW
HOW TO NAVIGATE IT,

20:52.319 --> 20:54.821
BUT I HAVE A FEELING

20:54.854 --> 21:00.427
I'M GONNA REGRET IT
IF I DON'T TRY.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.629
DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER ALLERGIES
I SHOULD BE AWARE OF?

21:02.662 --> 21:05.965
LIKE, WHERE DO YOU STAND
ON STEAMED SQUASH BLOSSOMS?

21:05.998 --> 21:06.899
I RESERVE THE RIGHT

21:06.933 --> 21:09.436
TO BE ALLERGIC TO ANYTHING
THAT SOUNDS GROSS.

21:09.469 --> 21:13.039
OKAY.

21:13.072 --> 21:15.942
YOU KNOW, I'M GONNA START
SHOWING SOON.

21:15.975 --> 21:18.578
LET'S JUST WORRY ABOUT
SQUASH BLOSSOMS FOR NOW.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.813
(laughs) OKAY.
