WEBVTT

00:04.055 --> 00:05.555
Are you sure the house
is this way?

00:05.557 --> 00:07.123
I don't recognize any landmarks.

00:07.125 --> 00:08.725
Yes, they made it
super hard to find.

00:08.727 --> 00:10.293
They changed the street names,
the address.

00:10.295 --> 00:11.928
I mean, you can't just
Google Map the Roanoke House,

00:11.930 --> 00:14.564
but I've studied every frame
of season one.

00:14.566 --> 00:16.265
I know where I'm going.

00:16.267 --> 00:18.067
Yo, yo, what are you doing?

00:18.069 --> 00:19.769
You can't turn the camera off;
we got to film everything.

00:19.771 --> 00:21.738
Okay. I was just gonna
take a leak.

00:21.740 --> 00:23.573
I didn't want to accidentally
get a shot of my johnson.

00:23.575 --> 00:25.775
Why do guys feel the need
to name their privates?

00:25.777 --> 00:27.910
"Penis" is a perfectly
acceptable word.

00:27.912 --> 00:30.313
TODD:
It is. I call mine
Little Big Man.

00:30.315 --> 00:32.582
MILO:
Dustin Hoffman, 1970.

00:32.584 --> 00:34.751
Definitely, definitely,
definitely 1970.

00:34.753 --> 00:38.788
He played a 121-year-old man,
raised as a boy by the Cheyenne.

00:38.790 --> 00:41.424
You know, I think he should have
won the Academy Award.

00:41.426 --> 00:42.959
Take a picture of me
with the sign.

00:42.961 --> 00:46.763
It could be an ironic
juxtaposition for the site.

00:46.765 --> 00:48.264
(sighs)

00:48.266 --> 00:49.932
How many likes do you think
we'll get on Instagram

00:49.934 --> 00:51.334
when we post footage
of the house

00:51.336 --> 00:52.602
at the peak of the blood moon?

00:52.604 --> 00:53.770
We are gonna blow up
the Internet, right?

00:53.772 --> 00:55.138
(mimics explosion)

00:55.140 --> 00:56.439
We're gonna... Yeah.
(mimics explosion)

00:56.441 --> 00:58.775
(laughing)
Okay, ready?

00:58.777 --> 01:00.143
And...
Oh, hold on.

01:00.145 --> 01:01.611
Action.

01:01.613 --> 01:03.613
SOPHIE: You know what I love
about season one?

01:03.615 --> 01:04.614
MILO:
Uh, everything?

01:04.616 --> 01:06.315
<i> My Roanoke Nightmare</i> is
awesome.

01:06.317 --> 01:07.950
SOPHIE:
On the surface,

01:07.952 --> 01:10.453
it's an interracial story
set in a post-racial world.

01:10.455 --> 01:12.689
Which, of course, is a lie.

01:12.691 --> 01:14.791
But they're really talking about
the colonization of America.

01:14.793 --> 01:16.325
The Butcher
and the Roanoke Colony.

01:16.327 --> 01:17.994
Which became a matriarchy
in a patriarchal system.

01:17.996 --> 01:19.462
That's why it's so timely.

01:19.464 --> 01:20.797
It's a battle
we're fighting today.

01:20.799 --> 01:21.964
MILO:
No, I don't know.

01:21.966 --> 01:24.467
I just think that the show
was scary.

01:24.469 --> 01:26.803
Yeah, Milo.
Racism is scary.

01:26.805 --> 01:28.805
Patriarchy is scary.

01:28.807 --> 01:30.373
Wait, you guys.
There it is.

01:30.375 --> 01:31.641
Episode three,
that's the tree

01:31.643 --> 01:33.209
where Flora's hoodie
got caught up in.

01:36.815 --> 01:38.815
(camera shutter clicking)

01:38.817 --> 01:40.616
(leaves rustling)

01:42.554 --> 01:44.821
Are you okay?

01:44.823 --> 01:47.690
You're bleeding.

01:47.692 --> 01:49.826
(shuddered breathing):
Where am I?

01:49.828 --> 01:51.494
(panting)

01:51.496 --> 01:52.662
Wait!

01:52.664 --> 01:53.830
Come on, we have to help her.

01:53.832 --> 01:55.898
MILO:
Yeah, come on.

01:57.736 --> 01:59.802
(whimpering and panting)

02:02.240 --> 02:04.674
(hard breathing)

02:04.676 --> 02:07.176
(crying):
It hurts so bad.

02:07.178 --> 02:09.846
It hurts so bad.

02:09.848 --> 02:11.714
I don't know where to go.
(crying)

02:11.716 --> 02:13.516
MILO: Holy shit.
How is she even standing?

02:13.518 --> 02:15.251
Wait, it's okay. We can
take you to a hospital.

02:15.253 --> 02:16.486
(crying):
My car...

02:17.522 --> 02:20.289
Stop running away!

02:21.693 --> 02:23.092
Over here.

02:23.094 --> 02:25.094
(feet pounding)

02:32.537 --> 02:34.604
(panting)

02:38.910 --> 02:41.944
MILO:
What... God.

02:48.419 --> 02:49.719
SOPHIE: Oh, my God!

02:49.721 --> 02:51.788
(gasps)

02:55.727 --> 02:57.794
(bleep), is that the same girl?

03:07.305 --> 03:08.805
AUDREY:
<i> I don't understand</i>
<i> why you're here.</i>

03:08.807 --> 03:10.573
This production is a shit show.
I've been in a motel

03:10.575 --> 03:12.775
for the past three days
without a word from anyone.

03:12.777 --> 03:15.912
No one's returned my calls
or my manager's calls.

03:15.914 --> 03:17.146
All I know is I have a call time

03:17.148 --> 03:18.915
and explicit instructions
from Sidney

03:18.917 --> 03:20.750
to be out front of the house
with a pig man costume on.

03:20.752 --> 03:22.652
I'm not going to
get fired or fined

03:22.654 --> 03:23.753
just because
they're disorganized.

03:23.755 --> 03:25.087
You're an actor?

03:25.089 --> 03:26.823
Yes. He played one
of the Butcher's sons.

03:26.825 --> 03:28.758
We had a couple
of scenes together.

03:28.760 --> 03:30.293
Sidney figured
that things would be getting

03:30.295 --> 03:31.794
a little stale at this point,

03:31.796 --> 03:33.663
so I'm here
to shake things up a bit.

03:33.665 --> 03:35.598
How did you get here?
Do you have a car?

03:35.600 --> 03:37.233
No. I Ubered.

03:39.170 --> 03:40.770
AUDREY:
<i> What about your phone?</i>

03:40.772 --> 03:43.940
Do you have your phone?
DYLAN: Of course not.

03:43.942 --> 03:45.775
Like I said,
explicit instructions.

03:45.777 --> 03:47.944
Be here at this time,
no phones,

03:47.946 --> 03:49.679
film everything.

03:49.681 --> 03:51.781
Look, I like acting,
but where I come from,

03:51.783 --> 03:54.817
when you don't follow orders
or show up on time, people die.

03:54.819 --> 03:57.887
The lack of integrity in this
business is really staggering.

03:58.790 --> 04:00.189
That makeup is really good.

04:00.191 --> 04:01.858
How'd they make it look
like your ear is gone?

04:01.860 --> 04:03.359
Is that a piece or something?

04:03.361 --> 04:05.361
No, you idiot.

04:05.363 --> 04:06.963
It's real.

04:06.965 --> 04:09.532
Everybody is dead.
Don't you get that?

04:09.534 --> 04:11.500
Sidney. All the other cast.

04:11.502 --> 04:13.803
Everyone is dead.

04:13.805 --> 04:15.171
We're not
pretending anymore.

04:15.173 --> 04:18.875
They're all dead.

04:31.723 --> 04:34.657
What the hell happened?

04:34.659 --> 04:36.659
AUDREY:
It's all real.

04:36.661 --> 04:38.995
The spirits, the
blood moon, the Polks.

04:38.997 --> 04:40.830
It is all real.

04:40.832 --> 04:42.999
We cannot stay here.

04:43.001 --> 04:45.167
Okay.

04:45.169 --> 04:47.036
We need to build
a stretcher for her,

04:47.038 --> 04:49.038
and we need to hoof it out
of here before it gets dark.

04:49.040 --> 04:51.007
LEE: We'll never make it;
it's miles.

04:51.009 --> 04:53.676
And it's the last night
of the blood moon cycle.

04:53.678 --> 04:55.845
It's the most dangerous night
to be here.

04:55.847 --> 04:58.014
DYLAN: I served two tours
in Afghanistan, SEAL Team Ten.

04:58.016 --> 05:00.216
Another soldier and I carried
a buddy twice as big,

05:00.218 --> 05:02.251
and shot up much worse than you

05:02.253 --> 05:04.887
six miles over uneven terrain
at 5,000 feet in two hours.

05:04.889 --> 05:06.389
And I don't know
what the ghosts have here,

05:06.391 --> 05:09.525
but the people hunting us
had AK-47s and RPGs.

05:09.527 --> 05:11.193
The Polks have cars and weapons.

05:11.195 --> 05:12.862
And they're much closer.

05:12.864 --> 05:14.563
If we can get there
and get a vehicle,

05:14.565 --> 05:16.198
we can get out of here
in half the time.

05:16.200 --> 05:19.402
Plus, Monet is still out there.

05:19.404 --> 05:20.903
The woman who played Lee?
Yes.

05:20.905 --> 05:22.071
The Polks have her.

05:22.073 --> 05:24.941
The ones who did all this to me.

05:27.045 --> 05:29.045
DYLAN:
Never leave a man behind...

05:29.047 --> 05:30.446
Okay, you two stay here.

05:30.448 --> 05:31.881
LEE: No. We have
to stay together.

05:31.883 --> 05:33.049
No, no, no, no, no.
Absolutely not.

05:33.051 --> 05:34.283
You'll slow me down.
No!

05:34.285 --> 05:36.552
We know the way
and the layout of the house.

05:36.554 --> 05:38.921
You need us.

05:38.923 --> 05:41.223
Please.

05:41.225 --> 05:42.925
Fine.

05:42.927 --> 05:44.460
Stay close to me.

05:44.462 --> 05:46.562
Everything's gonna be fine.

05:46.564 --> 05:49.465
Let's go.

05:49.467 --> 05:51.534
(door opens and closes)

05:54.906 --> 05:56.906
So let me guess,
you are a fan

05:56.908 --> 06:00.109
of<i> My Roanoke Nightmare.</i>

06:00.111 --> 06:03.813
I run a fan site,
Army of Roanoke.

06:03.815 --> 06:07.416
So that's why
you were out there.

06:07.418 --> 06:08.818
Uh, yeah, yeah.
I mean, we thought

06:08.820 --> 06:10.252
it was the best way
to get more followers.

06:10.254 --> 06:12.989
You know? Be authentic.

06:12.991 --> 06:14.757
Why didn't one of you stay
at the scene of the accident

06:14.759 --> 06:15.992
and wait for an officer?

06:15.994 --> 06:18.260
I'll be honest with you.

06:18.262 --> 06:21.630
I didn't believe any of it
until that moment.

06:21.632 --> 06:23.933
(gasping)

06:23.935 --> 06:25.768
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

06:25.770 --> 06:27.970
Todd, Todd, Todd...
Let go of me, Milo.

06:27.972 --> 06:29.939
Milo, get off of me, man, okay?

06:29.941 --> 06:31.607
I'll (bleep) take you down.

06:31.609 --> 06:33.142
(hard breathing)

06:33.144 --> 06:34.977
You saw that.

06:34.979 --> 06:36.312
Th-That's the chick...

06:36.314 --> 06:37.947
I mean, that's the one
we were following.

06:37.949 --> 06:39.949
She's dead, she's
(bleep) dead.

06:39.951 --> 06:42.284
Calm down. J-Just
take it easy, Todd.

06:42.286 --> 06:43.953
MILO: Dude, come on,
you're flipping out.

06:43.955 --> 06:45.988
Just chill.
You guys, we shouldn't
have come here,

06:45.990 --> 06:47.356
we shouldn't have come here,
we shouldn't have come here.

06:47.358 --> 06:49.025
I never wanted to
see a dead body.

06:49.027 --> 06:50.626
Now I can't get it
out of my head, okay?

06:50.628 --> 06:53.696
SOPHIE:
Todd. Todd.

06:53.698 --> 06:57.466
After we post this video,
we're going viral.

06:57.468 --> 06:59.335
(hard breathing)

06:59.337 --> 07:01.504
It's totally
worth it, dude.

07:01.506 --> 07:04.240
It's totally
worth it.

07:05.676 --> 07:07.977
(frightened laughing)

07:07.979 --> 07:11.313
It was completely freaky...

07:11.315 --> 07:13.315
and awesome.

07:13.317 --> 07:14.683
I got Todd to agree
to come here.

07:14.685 --> 07:16.018
Anyway, I-I drove,

07:16.020 --> 07:17.386
so he didn't really
have a choice.

07:17.388 --> 07:18.988
So you have footage
of the girl?

07:18.990 --> 07:20.990
Bloody but alive.

07:20.992 --> 07:22.324
No, Detective,
that's what I'm saying,

07:22.326 --> 07:24.393
is that she definitely
was not alive.

07:24.395 --> 07:26.162
MILO:
<i> She wasn't like a zombie.</i>

07:26.164 --> 07:29.999
Although she did have
that<i> Dawn of the Dead</i> look,

07:30.001 --> 07:33.002
but your typical ghost
or apparition

07:33.004 --> 07:35.337
is usually more...
uh, ephemeral.

07:35.339 --> 07:37.039
I'm not saying transparent,

07:37.041 --> 07:38.340
'cause that's like
Hollywood cheesy.

07:38.342 --> 07:41.510
I'm talking like... Korean.

07:41.512 --> 07:44.046
Totally subversive.

07:44.048 --> 07:45.347
So the victim was Asian?

07:45.349 --> 07:46.849
No, she was white.

07:46.851 --> 07:48.417
Couldn't you tell
when you found the body?

07:48.419 --> 07:50.186
Oh, that's
just the thing.

07:50.188 --> 07:51.520
There was no body.

07:51.522 --> 07:53.189
SOPHIE:
<i> That's impossible.</i>

07:53.191 --> 07:54.390
DETECTIVE:
<i> Let's cut the crap.</i>

07:54.392 --> 07:56.192
<i>Ever since that show was on TV,</i>

07:56.194 --> 07:59.728
<i> we've had to follow up on</i>
<i> a ton of bullshit reports,</i>

07:59.730 --> 08:01.197
<i> 'cause people like you</i>
<i> are trying to get hits</i>

08:01.199 --> 08:03.432
<i>on social media at our expense.</i>

08:03.434 --> 08:06.035
Officers had to be taken
away from their real jobs

08:06.037 --> 08:07.736
so that they can
investigate your prank.

08:07.738 --> 08:09.772
No! We told
you the truth.

08:09.774 --> 08:11.574
And I'm going
to tell the world

08:11.576 --> 08:13.609
about what's
really happening here.

08:13.611 --> 08:15.444
About the cover-up
by the police.

08:15.446 --> 08:17.213
Dude, don't you get it?

08:17.215 --> 08:18.881
I mean, this is exactly

08:18.883 --> 08:22.051
how every horror
movie works.

08:22.053 --> 08:23.586
God, the cops
don't believe it

08:23.588 --> 08:25.221
until it's too late!

08:25.223 --> 08:26.255
TODD:
<i> It's all there.</i>

08:26.257 --> 08:28.891
On camera, digital proof.

08:28.893 --> 08:31.093
Look, I'll-I'll admit it.

08:31.095 --> 08:33.095
I was freaked out,
I was ready to bail.

08:33.097 --> 08:34.630
But now that I've had time
to digest this,

08:34.632 --> 08:36.432
I'm ready to fight
the fear; I'm good to go.

08:36.434 --> 08:38.267
Go back home to Virginia,
'cause if you go anywhere

08:38.269 --> 08:42.605
near that house, I will have
you arrested for trespassing.

08:42.607 --> 08:45.307
Are you filming me,
you little asshole?

08:50.248 --> 08:52.214
(panting)

08:53.918 --> 08:55.084
DYLAN:
Okay, it's getting late,

08:55.086 --> 08:57.086
and this place is bigger
than I thought.

08:57.088 --> 08:58.921
I say we just take

08:58.923 --> 09:01.624
that truck and go, let the
cops come back for Monet.

09:01.626 --> 09:04.093
What about leaving
no man behind?
It's right up there with

09:04.095 --> 09:06.629
don't walk into enemy
territory blind and unarmed.

09:06.631 --> 09:08.097
If it is this blood moon shit
that killed all those people

09:08.099 --> 09:10.633
back at the house, we don't
want any part of that.

09:10.635 --> 09:13.936
We're not blind.
Give me your phone.

09:13.938 --> 09:16.105
(panting)

09:16.107 --> 09:19.275
She could be
in one of these buildings.

09:19.277 --> 09:22.111
Get the truck started.

09:22.113 --> 09:24.146
Audrey and I will
go find Monet.

09:24.148 --> 09:25.481
Fine. One quick sweep,
but as soon

09:25.483 --> 09:26.815
as you hear that truck start,

09:26.817 --> 09:28.450
the bad guys
are gonna hear it, too.

09:28.452 --> 09:29.952
So you're only gonna have
about three minutes,

09:29.954 --> 09:31.187
and the sun is setting fast.

09:31.189 --> 09:33.122
It's gonna be dark soon.
Okay.

09:33.124 --> 09:36.825
Give us a signal.
Okay.

09:36.827 --> 09:39.361
You see any weapons, grab 'em.

09:44.502 --> 09:46.168
LEE:
That's where they had me.

09:46.170 --> 09:47.970
That's gonna be a bit
of a hike on this leg.

09:47.972 --> 09:49.305
Can you check it out?
Yes.

09:49.307 --> 09:52.474
Maybe she's there,
and hopefully

09:52.476 --> 09:55.211
that camera with the tapes
is still there. I'll get it.

09:55.213 --> 09:58.147
Okay. Fine. Come on.

09:58.149 --> 10:00.149
Seriously, though,
Lee, but we have

10:00.151 --> 10:03.219
to be ready to go as soon
as we hear that truck start,

10:03.221 --> 10:05.354
even if we are empty-handed.

10:05.356 --> 10:08.891
I'm not interested in being
exonerated after I'm dead.

10:08.893 --> 10:11.227
Lee, I'm serious.

10:11.229 --> 10:14.230
If you are not there,
we are leaving.

10:16.334 --> 10:19.335
I'll be there...
with those damn tapes.

10:19.337 --> 10:22.071
We didn't come back
to this hell house empty-handed.

10:22.073 --> 10:25.341
Okay. That's the signal.

10:25.343 --> 10:29.278
(panting)

10:46.097 --> 10:48.430
(panting)

10:55.373 --> 10:57.239
(sighs, gun clicks)

10:57.241 --> 10:58.607
(metallic clinking)

11:00.544 --> 11:02.878
(panting)

11:02.880 --> 11:06.415
(moaning)
Monet?

11:06.417 --> 11:09.118
(yelling)
No, it's okay.
It's me. It's me. It's me.

11:09.120 --> 11:11.053
Look at me. It's me.

11:11.055 --> 11:13.389
It's me. It's me.
(whimpering)

11:13.391 --> 11:15.257
Okay.

11:15.259 --> 11:17.626
(door creaks open)

11:20.264 --> 11:22.631
(door creaks shut)

11:30.274 --> 11:32.341
(beep)

11:35.446 --> 11:39.081
(whispering):
Where's the goddamn button
for delete?

11:39.083 --> 11:42.284
(truck engine starts)

11:42.286 --> 11:43.986
AUDREY:
Dear God, it's the truck.

11:43.988 --> 11:45.954
We have to go.
We have to go. We have no time.

11:45.956 --> 11:49.091
(Monet screams, whimpers)

11:49.093 --> 11:50.426
(blow landing)
Oh!

11:50.428 --> 11:51.960
(coughs)

11:51.962 --> 11:55.597
(groaning,
blow landing)

11:55.599 --> 11:57.933
You killed Mama.
She was the glue

11:57.935 --> 12:00.769
that held this
family together.

12:00.771 --> 12:04.640
I'm gonna murder you real slow
for what you done.
(Monet whimpering)

12:04.642 --> 12:08.277
AUDREY:
Can you say that again?

12:08.279 --> 12:14.116
Said I'm gonna murder you
real slow.

12:14.118 --> 12:16.685
(Monet screams,
Ishmael groaning)

12:16.687 --> 12:20.322
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

12:20.324 --> 12:23.492
(groaning)

12:23.494 --> 12:25.694
LEE:
You better get out of here!

12:25.696 --> 12:28.197
I have evidence of everything

12:28.199 --> 12:30.866
you people have done
on this camera!

12:30.868 --> 12:33.402
(truck engine running)

12:36.006 --> 12:40.476
Ishmael? Ishmael, they coming!

12:40.478 --> 12:43.379
Hey, the blood moon is full,
Mama's gone.

12:43.381 --> 12:48.317
(panting):
Can't nobody protect us now.

12:48.319 --> 12:50.586
(groans, panting)

12:51.822 --> 12:54.056
(truck door slams,
engine revving)

12:54.058 --> 12:58.660
(groaning)

12:58.662 --> 13:01.497
(both whimpering)

13:01.499 --> 13:04.700
AUDREY:
Oh, my God!

13:04.702 --> 13:07.236
MONET:
Oh, Dylan! Damn!
Dylan?

13:07.238 --> 13:08.504
Damn!
Oh, my God.

13:08.506 --> 13:10.506
(both crying)

13:10.508 --> 13:12.341
AUDREY:
Oh, no!

13:12.343 --> 13:15.411
No!
Run! Go. Run.

13:15.413 --> 13:17.012
Run! Go! Go!
Run!

13:17.014 --> 13:18.514
Go!

13:18.516 --> 13:19.748
Oh!
Oh, faster!
Faster! Go!

13:19.750 --> 13:21.450
(screaming)

13:31.929 --> 13:33.929
MONET:
Oh, God.
Oh!

13:33.931 --> 13:37.199
(Monet gasps, door slams shut)

13:37.201 --> 13:39.435
Ho-ly shit!

13:39.437 --> 13:41.270
I told you.

13:41.272 --> 13:42.905
Why the hell
did we come back here?!

13:42.907 --> 13:46.575
Well, where else
are we supposed to go?

13:46.577 --> 13:51.213
(sighs)
At least here we have
some cover, some protection.

13:51.215 --> 13:53.415
Don't you get it?
There<i> is</i> no protection!

13:53.417 --> 13:58.086
Christ, that dead bloke we left
back there-- he was in

13:58.088 --> 13:59.721
the bloody military,
and he's dead!

13:59.723 --> 14:02.224
Just how long do you expect us
to survive this?

14:02.226 --> 14:05.894
Well, I don't know, but we're
not gonna survive anything

14:05.896 --> 14:07.963
unless you get
your shit together!

14:07.965 --> 14:10.466
Calm down.
Calm down?!

14:10.468 --> 14:13.302
Oh, my God, I've just run

14:13.304 --> 14:16.104
through the godforsaken
wilderness for miles!

14:16.106 --> 14:17.406
I've been mutilated
by a carousel

14:17.408 --> 14:19.308
of maniacs, so forgive me

14:19.310 --> 14:22.144
if I cannot get
my (bleep) shit together!

14:22.146 --> 14:24.513
(panting)

14:33.424 --> 14:37.993
What do you think
happened to Lee?

14:37.995 --> 14:39.828
(panting)

14:39.830 --> 14:42.965
I think
she's probably dead, too.

14:42.967 --> 14:45.767
Like everybody else.

14:45.769 --> 14:47.636
Like my Rory.

14:47.638 --> 14:50.772
No, no, no, no, no.
She could still be alive.

14:50.774 --> 14:53.442
Oh, no, she's not!

14:53.444 --> 14:58.480
Something terrible happened
to her, I know it.

14:58.482 --> 15:00.449
She never would have
left this behind.

15:00.451 --> 15:03.952
Lee insisted that no one
would believe our story.

15:03.954 --> 15:07.022
She said that the only way
to prove our innocence

15:07.024 --> 15:09.358
was to get this tape back.

15:09.360 --> 15:13.795
To show the world
what they did to us.

15:13.797 --> 15:17.132
That we did what we did
because we had to do it...

15:17.134 --> 15:19.968
to survive.

15:19.970 --> 15:22.004
(panting)

15:22.006 --> 15:24.540
What are you doing?

15:36.654 --> 15:40.222
(beeps)

15:40.224 --> 15:42.491
MAMA POLK: Wouldn't do
to have you bleedin' out

15:42.493 --> 15:44.526
before we finish taking
prime cuts. Go on.

15:44.528 --> 15:45.994
LEE (screaming):
No!

15:45.996 --> 15:48.163
Ooh, sweet Jesus.
(Lee's screaming continues)

15:48.165 --> 15:50.666
God, it's (bleep) demented!

15:50.668 --> 15:52.501
Oh.

15:52.503 --> 15:54.503
Wait a minute.

15:54.505 --> 15:56.338
LEE:
Baby girl,

15:56.340 --> 15:59.841
you've heard many things
about me this past year.

15:59.843 --> 16:02.177
About what I've done.

16:02.179 --> 16:04.680
That I've said many things

16:04.682 --> 16:07.549
to many people
proclaiming my innocence.

16:07.551 --> 16:10.552
(gasping)
<i> So I want you</i>
<i> to tell you the truth.</i>

16:10.554 --> 16:12.487
(whimpering)

16:13.524 --> 16:16.024
I killed Daddy.

16:16.026 --> 16:18.527
Mm. Mm, mm.

16:18.529 --> 16:20.562
That's on me and me alone.

16:20.564 --> 16:21.863
Oh.

16:21.865 --> 16:23.532
No one else helped me.

16:23.534 --> 16:26.368
(crying):
It's nobody's fault,
except mine.

16:26.370 --> 16:30.272
<i> He was gonna take you away</i>
<i> from me,</i>

16:30.274 --> 16:32.874
<i> and I couldn't see my life</i>
<i> going forward that way</i>

16:32.876 --> 16:34.443
<i> without you.</i>

16:34.445 --> 16:36.712
(inhuman howling)

16:36.714 --> 16:38.547
(blows landing)

16:38.549 --> 16:42.551
(groaning)

16:42.553 --> 16:44.252
LEE:
<i> No more secrets.</i>

16:44.254 --> 16:46.888
<i> I don't know if one day</i>
<i> you'll forgive me.</i>

16:46.890 --> 16:48.957
<i> I just want you to go on</i>

16:48.959 --> 16:51.259
<i> without the weight</i>
<i> of lies and doubt.</i>

16:51.261 --> 16:53.462
(growling)

16:53.464 --> 16:57.633
Surrender to me.

17:03.574 --> 17:05.407
Look at that moon.

17:05.409 --> 17:07.242
It's so full and bright.

17:07.244 --> 17:09.478
You can see why people thought
it had mystical powers.

17:09.480 --> 17:11.580
It's feminine energy.
Mother moon affects

17:11.582 --> 17:13.782
everything from the
tide to fertility

17:13.784 --> 17:15.584
to the menstrual cycle.

17:15.586 --> 17:18.120
Speaking of blood,
this moon is also a killer.

17:18.122 --> 17:20.489
Did you just make a period joke?

17:20.491 --> 17:22.758
Yeah.
Wait. Holy shit,
since we posted that video

17:22.760 --> 17:24.660
with the dead body
and the ghost, we've added

17:24.662 --> 17:26.795
20,000 followers.
What?!

17:26.797 --> 17:28.497
Yeah, that was an hour ago.

17:28.499 --> 17:30.132
(laughter)

17:30.134 --> 17:31.633
We're trending on Twitter.

17:31.635 --> 17:32.934
#BloodMoon.

17:32.936 --> 17:35.604
How much further
to the house?
Uh,

17:35.606 --> 17:37.439
I know we're close.

17:37.441 --> 17:39.141
Guys, I think it's this way.

17:39.143 --> 17:41.343
Guys, this is such a good idea.

17:41.345 --> 17:43.779
God, I can't wait
to get to the house!

17:43.781 --> 17:46.782
(insects chirring, bird cooing)
TODD:
Man, I don't know

17:46.784 --> 17:48.684
why I let you talk me
into coming back here.

17:48.686 --> 17:51.953
SOPHIE:
To prove to the cops and our
fans that we're not liars.

17:51.955 --> 17:53.355
Yeah, of course,
we're not liars.

17:53.357 --> 17:55.357
Wait, guys,
I think this is where

17:55.359 --> 17:57.526
they burned Mason's body.
Oh, sweet.

17:57.528 --> 18:00.128
SOPHIE (chuckling):
Oh...
Hell, yes.

18:00.130 --> 18:02.664
Whoa. Whoa, whoa-- is that

18:02.666 --> 18:04.032
that girl from before?

18:04.034 --> 18:06.134
Look.

18:06.136 --> 18:08.704
No, that's Lee Harris.

18:08.706 --> 18:10.639
From
<i>Roanoke Nightmare?</i>

18:10.641 --> 18:11.707
Yeah, yeah, I...

18:11.709 --> 18:13.742
It looks like she's hurt.

18:14.812 --> 18:16.678
Hey... you get
the feeling like

18:16.680 --> 18:19.014
dark shit's happening
all around us?

18:19.016 --> 18:21.650
Todd, wait up.
Hey, Lee, uh...

18:21.652 --> 18:24.386
Or... Ms. Harris. First,
let me just say that

18:24.388 --> 18:26.321
I-I'm a huge fan.

18:26.323 --> 18:28.223
(Sophie gasps)
(Todd gurgles)

18:28.225 --> 18:29.658
(thunk)

18:29.660 --> 18:30.726
Oh! Oh!
(screams)

18:33.664 --> 18:35.897
(both screaming)

18:45.008 --> 18:46.374
Ow!

18:46.376 --> 18:48.710
(grunts)
Oh, God...

18:48.712 --> 18:50.779
(both whimpering)

18:53.684 --> 18:56.885
She killed...
she killed Todd.

18:56.887 --> 18:59.387
She (bleep) butchered him!
That (bleep) bitch!

18:59.389 --> 19:02.090
Shut up! Shut up!
I got to see if she followed us.

19:09.700 --> 19:12.701
(screams)

19:12.703 --> 19:14.402
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

19:14.404 --> 19:17.706
We stick together, okay?

19:17.708 --> 19:19.775
Okay?

19:30.120 --> 19:32.187
(Sophie whimpering)

19:39.062 --> 19:40.562
It's like
<i> The Killing Fields.</i>

19:40.564 --> 19:43.765
This is bad.
This is all bad.

19:43.767 --> 19:46.468
What? What?!

19:46.470 --> 19:48.537
(screams)

19:49.740 --> 19:51.640
(grunts)

19:51.642 --> 19:54.976
Go! Go, go, go, go, go!

19:58.115 --> 20:00.916
(panting):
Oh, God.

20:00.918 --> 20:03.251
Oh, (bleep)! (bleep)!

20:03.253 --> 20:04.920
(pounding on door)

20:04.922 --> 20:06.154
(screams)

20:06.156 --> 20:07.923
Jesus!

20:07.925 --> 20:09.991
What the hell was that?

20:11.962 --> 20:14.596
I think that was Ambrose.

20:14.598 --> 20:16.832
He played The Butcher's son
in season one.

20:23.340 --> 20:25.607
This must be

20:25.609 --> 20:26.942
the control room.

20:26.944 --> 20:29.177
They said the entire cast

20:29.179 --> 20:31.112
was going back to the house
for season two.

20:31.114 --> 20:32.848
Looks like most of them
didn't make it.

20:35.118 --> 20:36.451
Oh, God, no.

20:36.453 --> 20:37.786
I love Shelby.

20:37.788 --> 20:40.822
And who's that?

20:40.824 --> 20:43.859
Is everybody dead?

20:43.861 --> 20:45.827
AUDREY:
Oh, my God.

20:45.829 --> 20:46.995
I don't really care
about keeping

20:46.997 --> 20:48.830
a clear head
That's Audrey Tindall.

20:48.832 --> 20:50.131
at the moment.
She played Shelby.

20:50.133 --> 20:52.801
A-At least she's alive.
Wait...

20:52.803 --> 20:55.871
is this all part of the show?

20:55.873 --> 20:59.808
I mean... is anything even real?

20:59.810 --> 21:01.643
What happened to
Todd was real.

21:01.645 --> 21:04.646
MONET: I need a drink.

21:04.648 --> 21:06.014
AUDREY: Monet,

21:06.016 --> 21:08.316
don't you have your sobriety
to think about?

21:08.318 --> 21:09.651
No, don't do that.

21:09.653 --> 21:12.520
You have to keep
a clear head.

21:12.522 --> 21:14.823
MONET: You don't know me,
Audrey. I can't (bleep) face

21:14.825 --> 21:17.559
these monsters without
some liquid courage.

21:19.830 --> 21:21.830
Shit! Shit!

21:21.832 --> 21:24.332
Look. It's Lee.

21:24.334 --> 21:26.401
She's coming for them.

21:41.752 --> 21:43.385
SOPHIE:
No. It's-it's not a prank.
There's at least three

21:43.387 --> 21:46.254
dead bodies outside.
You have to come.

21:47.591 --> 21:49.190
Hello?

21:49.192 --> 21:50.558
(exclaims)

21:50.560 --> 21:52.027
The cops don't believe me.

21:52.029 --> 21:54.763
It's just like on
the show. Remember?

21:54.765 --> 21:59.367
Matt called 911, no one came?

21:59.369 --> 22:00.702
Oh, God, she's
in the house.

22:00.704 --> 22:02.270
Oh, God.

22:02.272 --> 22:06.207
We have to
do something.

22:06.209 --> 22:08.443
What the hell
are we gonna do?

22:14.718 --> 22:16.718
We have to stop her.

22:16.720 --> 22:19.888
(laughs)

22:19.890 --> 22:21.456
What?

22:21.458 --> 22:22.891
U... Us? Are you...

22:22.893 --> 22:24.459
are you serious?

22:24.461 --> 22:27.562
If we get to the house in time
we can take her down.

22:27.564 --> 22:28.897
Sophie.

22:28.899 --> 22:32.067
She killed Todd.
And now she's gonna

22:32.069 --> 22:33.268
kill Shelby and Lee.

22:33.270 --> 22:35.070
She<i> is</i> Lee!

22:35.072 --> 22:37.906
That's the real Lee!

22:37.908 --> 22:39.607
You know what I mean.

22:39.609 --> 22:42.077
We're the only ones
who knows what she's capable of.

22:42.079 --> 22:45.246
We have to save Audrey
and Monet.

22:45.248 --> 22:47.515
Please, Milo. Help me.

22:50.620 --> 22:53.021
But that freaky guy's out there.

23:06.770 --> 23:08.937
You see him?

23:08.939 --> 23:10.205
No.

23:11.942 --> 23:14.009
It's a blood moon.

23:14.011 --> 23:15.310
It's a real blood moon.

23:15.312 --> 23:16.611
Milo.

23:16.613 --> 23:18.079
Let's go.

23:21.118 --> 23:23.184
(Sophie whimpering)

23:31.995 --> 23:34.796
We wasting time here.

23:34.798 --> 23:37.499
We should just take this tape

23:37.501 --> 23:38.967
to the cops right now.

23:38.969 --> 23:40.502
What is the point?

23:40.504 --> 23:41.970
Honestly?

23:41.972 --> 23:43.805
Lee was gone,
the truck was gone.

23:43.807 --> 23:46.141
She never would have left that
tape there if she were alive.

23:46.143 --> 23:48.977
Sure one of the Polk boys
have nabbed her by now.

23:48.979 --> 23:51.679
Well, good.
I hope he was hungry!

23:51.681 --> 23:53.048
Shit.

23:53.050 --> 23:55.150
Oh, my God, Monet.

23:55.152 --> 23:57.819
Wish you had a camera on you
for that one.

23:57.821 --> 24:00.455
It's r...
(loud crash outside)

24:02.159 --> 24:03.825
(whispers):
What the hell was that?

24:03.827 --> 24:06.161
Oh, my God,
this is it.

24:06.163 --> 24:09.330
This is it. I don't
want to die.

24:09.332 --> 24:11.332
Oh, God, I'm gonna...
Okay, okay, okay!

24:11.334 --> 24:13.001
(whispers): Shut up!
All right,
all right.

24:13.003 --> 24:15.070
Come on, come on.

24:17.541 --> 24:19.107
Okay.

24:26.850 --> 24:28.917
What is it?

24:30.087 --> 24:31.719
Oh, my God.

24:31.721 --> 24:33.755
Lee.
Mm, mm, mm.

24:33.757 --> 24:35.824
You're back.
(muttering)

24:38.028 --> 24:40.361
We went looking
everywhere for you.

24:40.363 --> 24:44.199
Where did you go?
What happened to you out there?

24:44.201 --> 24:46.534
Lee.

24:46.536 --> 24:48.570
You don't belong here.

24:48.572 --> 24:51.706
Your vile presence
defiles this sacred ground.

24:51.708 --> 24:55.043
Me?
Who you calling
vile, huh?

24:55.045 --> 24:57.078
You the murderer.

24:57.080 --> 25:00.782
You didn't fool me,
not for one minute.

25:00.784 --> 25:03.084
I knew it all along.

25:03.086 --> 25:05.053
And now,
tomorrow, the cops

25:05.055 --> 25:06.721
and everybody else
gonna know it, too.

25:06.723 --> 25:08.256
And I'm not afraid of you.

25:08.258 --> 25:09.891
Standing there with
your little cleaver

25:09.893 --> 25:11.392
and saying weird
shit. Yeah,

25:11.394 --> 25:13.461
I just called
you a murderer.

25:13.463 --> 25:15.530
Anything to say
about that?

25:17.234 --> 25:19.400
(Audrey screams)

25:19.402 --> 25:22.637
No! Oh, my God.

25:22.639 --> 25:26.107
You stay back. You
don't make me kill you.
These grounds

25:26.109 --> 25:27.809
must be cleansed

25:27.811 --> 25:29.477
with fire and blood.

25:29.479 --> 25:31.079
(grunts)
Aah!

25:31.081 --> 25:34.182
(grunting)

25:39.089 --> 25:40.522
Oh! Oh, my God!

25:42.259 --> 25:45.160

25:52.169 --> 25:54.435
This is Sophie Green,
and I'm here to bear witness

25:54.437 --> 25:56.104
to the evil
that is happening out here.

25:56.106 --> 25:58.439
I'm in the woods near the house
of<i> My Roanoke Nightmare</i>

25:58.441 --> 26:01.276
in eastern North Carolina.

26:01.278 --> 26:03.278
It's all real.

26:03.280 --> 26:06.147
There's people dead everywhere.

26:06.149 --> 26:08.283
Lee Harris is a murderer.

26:08.285 --> 26:10.151
She-she...

26:10.153 --> 26:12.520
she just killed my friend,
Todd Connor,

26:12.522 --> 26:14.022
with a cleaver.

26:14.024 --> 26:16.024
And she's on her way
to kill Audrey Tindall

26:16.026 --> 26:18.126
and Monet Tumusiime
right now.

26:18.128 --> 26:20.461
They're in the house
and they're in danger.

26:20.463 --> 26:22.130
We called the police
but they won't listen.

26:22.132 --> 26:23.631
Sophie.

26:23.633 --> 26:26.467
Sophie, you've got to
slow down, okay?

26:26.469 --> 26:27.869
We're almost there.

26:27.871 --> 26:30.305
How the (bleep) do you know?

26:30.307 --> 26:31.673
You have to stay calm.

26:31.675 --> 26:32.974
We're getting close.

26:32.976 --> 26:34.475
(bleep) that, okay?
We're lost.

26:34.477 --> 26:37.178
Todd was the only one
who knew where we were going

26:37.180 --> 26:39.314
and he's (bleep) dead, okay?
He's (bleep) dead.

26:39.316 --> 26:41.883
We got to turn around.

26:41.885 --> 26:43.851
Milo.

26:43.853 --> 26:45.720

26:47.657 --> 26:50.191
No. Sophie.

26:50.193 --> 26:52.894

27:16.853 --> 27:19.254

28:04.567 --> 28:07.335
MILO:

28:11.808 --> 28:13.474
Oh, my God.

28:14.911 --> 28:17.745

28:17.747 --> 28:19.847
Holy shit, it's that dude.

28:27.290 --> 28:32.260
(slice, pained groaning)

28:32.262 --> 28:34.062

28:44.341 --> 28:46.307
Holy shit.

28:46.309 --> 28:47.842
We got to get the

MILO:
No!
Let go!

29:17.340 --> 29:18.873
Let me go!
No!

29:18.875 --> 29:20.475
People are watching this.

29:20.477 --> 29:22.310
Millions of people,

The po-- the cops are coming!
Oh, God!

29:29.018 --> 29:30.818
They're going to be here!
MILO:

29:30.820 --> 29:34.322
Milo!
(bleep) you, get
your hands off of me!

29:34.324 --> 29:35.656
SOPHIE:
Help!

Sophie, oh, God!

29:38.495 --> 29:41.062
No.

29:42.665 --> 29:44.999
Present yourself for slaughter.

29:45.001 --> 29:46.367
We don't deserve to die,

29:46.369 --> 29:47.502
you bitch!

29:47.504 --> 29:48.836
(crying):
Please, Lee.

29:48.838 --> 29:50.371
We don't want to be here.

29:50.373 --> 29:52.340
I want to be a doctor
to-to help people.

29:52.342 --> 29:53.875
Milo's a good person.

29:53.877 --> 29:55.176
He volunteers at the shelter.

29:55.178 --> 29:56.511
Don't do this.

29:56.513 --> 29:57.845
(grunts)

29:57.847 --> 30:01.048
(grunts)

30:01.050 --> 30:03.351
I want to go home.

30:03.353 --> 30:05.853
I'm so sorry.

30:05.855 --> 30:07.188
Please.

30:24.374 --> 30:27.442
LEE:
She is the queen of every hive.

30:27.444 --> 30:31.546
She is the tree and the
lightning that strikes it.

30:31.548 --> 30:34.582
The land will weep with blood

30:34.584 --> 30:38.119

as sacrifice.
