WEBVTT

01:17.995 --> 01:23.701
And I thought government agents
were meant to be taller.

01:23.735 --> 01:28.405
And I thought private security
were meant to be better dressed.

01:35.512 --> 01:38.315
How's it going man?

01:38.348 --> 01:40.051
Hey, buddy.

01:40.084 --> 01:43.453
No seriously,
what is with the get up?

01:43.487 --> 01:46.289
A leather jacket
and an assault vest?

01:46.323 --> 01:49.794
- Oh, he went for the jacket.
- Well...

01:49.827 --> 01:52.864
it's not going to make
New York Fashion Week now is it?

01:52.897 --> 01:54.431
I've got three
of these bad boys,

01:54.464 --> 01:56.067
they never go out of fashion.

01:56.100 --> 01:58.069
Classic's a classic!

01:58.102 --> 01:59.904
You guys make
a great double act,

01:59.937 --> 02:01.706
why don't you have
your own show?

02:01.739 --> 02:04.876
- This is our show.
- No, this is my show.

02:04.909 --> 02:08.012
Now, would you like
the lowdown on the job?

02:08.045 --> 02:09.790
I'm assuming you both
haven't bothered to read it

02:09.814 --> 02:11.082
since it was such last minute?

02:11.115 --> 02:12.850
Does a bear shit in the woods?

02:12.884 --> 02:14.451
No but your mom does.

02:14.484 --> 02:17.655
- Oh, breaking out the mommas.
- Right, guys.

02:17.688 --> 02:23.393
So basically, your client
is the CEO of an energy company.

02:23.426 --> 02:26.630
Mr. Gustav and his wife
are attending a conference

02:26.664 --> 02:28.099
or mini-summit here at this

02:28.132 --> 02:31.068
security nightmare
of a business center.

02:31.102 --> 02:35.006
Unfortunately,
some of the company's activity,

02:35.039 --> 02:37.374
let's just say
is less than ethical.

02:37.407 --> 02:39.476
Their exploitation of groups
in the Middle East

02:39.509 --> 02:41.545
have resulted in them
coming under fire

02:41.578 --> 02:44.414
from both the media
and campaigners,

02:44.447 --> 02:47.752
to the point
where an opposing force,

02:47.785 --> 02:50.620
let's just call them terrorists
for all intents and purposes,

02:50.655 --> 02:52.455
have issued death threats
towards them.

02:52.489 --> 02:58.528
The problem is the death threats
referenced this conference.

02:58.562 --> 03:00.731
It sounds like
you're using them as bait.

03:00.765 --> 03:02.599
- Again?
- Does he know that?

03:02.632 --> 03:05.736
It was Mr. Gustav's idea
for the conference to go ahead.

03:05.770 --> 03:07.738
So I need you two
to reassure him

03:07.772 --> 03:10.107
that everything
is going to be okay.

03:10.141 --> 03:11.809
I will let him know
there's going to be

03:11.843 --> 03:14.812
two security personnel
with them at all times.

03:14.846 --> 03:17.715
Uh huh, who are they?

03:17.748 --> 03:19.482
Trust me,
if I didn't know you two

03:19.516 --> 03:21.384
I would have
said the same thing.

03:21.418 --> 03:23.553
Party kicks off
in 45 minute guys.

03:23.587 --> 03:28.391
Oh, a party.

03:28.425 --> 03:30.493
I'm off to do one last sweep
of the building.

03:30.527 --> 03:33.664
Oh, get some better gear on.

03:33.698 --> 03:35.632
You're not protecting
a celebrity now.

03:35.666 --> 03:37.668
This is the big time.

03:37.702 --> 03:39.737
Ain't you a bit short
for the big time?

03:39.770 --> 03:43.607
Always with the height jokes.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.177
Size isn't everything, Nick.

03:46.210 --> 03:49.680
That's just something
that short people say.

03:53.117 --> 03:56.153
Yeah, you're right.

03:56.187 --> 03:59.556
Asshole.

05:05.122 --> 05:09.226
So, a Scotsman, an Englishman
and an Irishman

05:09.260 --> 05:12.663
- walk into a bar...
- Oh, here we go.

05:12.697 --> 05:14.732
And the bartender goes

05:14.765 --> 05:17.234
is this some kind of
fucking joke?

05:44.561 --> 05:45.963
You two, get back!

05:48.766 --> 05:53.971
I go high, you go low.

06:03.681 --> 06:05.916
Stokes, get them out of here!

06:08.686 --> 06:10.553
You two, get behind the door.

06:20.931 --> 06:23.667
Okay, when I say now,
open the lift door.

06:23.701 --> 06:24.701
Okay.

06:33.110 --> 06:35.346
Now!

06:44.088 --> 06:45.923
How the fuck did
you get in this building?

06:45.956 --> 06:47.124
Brain power.

06:49.760 --> 06:52.096
Meet fire power.

06:52.129 --> 06:54.198
Clear!

07:12.750 --> 07:16.220
There we go.

07:16.253 --> 07:17.354
Come on.

07:40.377 --> 07:42.313
You okay, Nick?

08:34.064 --> 08:36.867
You took your time.

08:36.901 --> 08:42.840
Clear?

08:42.873 --> 08:46.810
Right, up you get.

09:02.893 --> 09:05.262
Fancy meeting you here.

09:05.296 --> 09:07.064
Old habits die hard.

09:07.097 --> 09:10.000
Best be good reason.

09:10.034 --> 09:11.268
There is.

09:11.302 --> 09:13.103
Skulking about
in the cold and the dark

09:13.137 --> 09:14.772
spying on my own
fucking drug deal.

09:14.805 --> 09:16.006
I must be mad.

09:16.040 --> 09:18.375
Well, like they say.

09:18.409 --> 09:20.878
If you want something
done properly.

09:20.911 --> 09:24.248
The point in hiring a bag man is
so we don't have to do the drop.

09:24.281 --> 09:27.318
Well, your bag man
seems a little bit off.

09:27.351 --> 09:29.386
What makes you say that?

09:29.420 --> 09:31.822
Well, before he left,

09:31.855 --> 09:34.892
I went to strap a GPS tracker
under the seat of his car.

09:34.925 --> 09:36.961
Just in case.

09:36.994 --> 09:39.230
A GPS tracker?

09:39.263 --> 09:42.800
That's why you're
my head of security.

09:42.833 --> 09:46.737
Yeah, but I found this
in the back seat.

09:53.577 --> 09:55.879
I fucking told him.

09:55.913 --> 09:59.183
Never leave that out in view,
always keep it hidden.

09:59.216 --> 10:02.319
Yeah, figures.

10:02.353 --> 10:06.090
Thing is, the deal
is minutes from going down

10:06.123 --> 10:07.524
and I've got the case.

10:07.558 --> 10:09.393
So what's he got in there?

10:22.139 --> 10:26.076
And as if by magic,
the shopkeeper appears.

10:37.988 --> 10:44.061
Money on the table.

10:53.504 --> 10:58.409
You look a bit nervous.

10:58.442 --> 11:01.145
First time this big?

11:05.249 --> 11:08.319
You could have ironed it.

11:08.352 --> 11:11.221
That's not that
funny money is it?

11:11.255 --> 11:15.225
You see me laughing?

11:15.259 --> 11:18.195
Just checking.

11:18.228 --> 11:20.597
And the product?

11:20.631 --> 11:22.366
It's the best there is.

11:22.399 --> 11:27.171
Our finest yet.

11:27.204 --> 11:29.873
Only the best.

11:37.314 --> 11:38.215
Been a pleasure.

11:38.248 --> 11:42.286
Whoa, just a sec.

11:42.319 --> 11:44.188
Is there a problem?

11:44.221 --> 11:45.889
Mind if I sample it first?

11:45.923 --> 11:47.558
Ah, no, no.

11:47.591 --> 11:50.060
That's against company policy.

11:50.094 --> 11:53.897
Do you think this is some
kind of back alley hand job?

11:53.931 --> 11:58.435
Think I'm gonna hand over 200
large without trying the merch?

11:58.469 --> 12:02.005
I sample the product
or the money leaves the room

12:02.039 --> 12:04.508
and not with you.

12:04.541 --> 12:08.680
Where's the trust
in business these days?

12:08.713 --> 12:12.182
Trust goes out the window
with guys like you.

12:12.216 --> 12:13.217
It looks good to me.

12:13.250 --> 12:14.351
Shut your mouth.

12:14.385 --> 12:19.022
Yeah, shut your mouth.

12:19.056 --> 12:22.960
I'm asking nicely,
I won't ask nicely again.

12:22.993 --> 12:27.464
I dip the product or we walk.

12:27.498 --> 12:33.570
Bit unorthodox but carry on.

12:43.614 --> 12:47.551
What the fuck is this?

12:47.584 --> 12:51.588
That's our finest,
purest product yet.

12:51.622 --> 12:54.358
That shit's been cut
more times than my front lawn.

12:54.391 --> 12:59.463
We do not cut our gear.

12:59.496 --> 13:02.332
What kind of crazy shit
are you trying to pull here?

13:02.366 --> 13:03.668
Where's the real merch?

13:03.701 --> 13:07.070
That is the real merch.

13:07.104 --> 13:09.239
The fuck it is.

13:17.548 --> 13:22.252
Nobody pulls a gun on me.

13:28.425 --> 13:31.495
Do you know what this is?

13:31.528 --> 13:34.097
No.

13:36.233 --> 13:39.603
You're about to find out.

13:42.339 --> 13:44.541
Look.

13:52.049 --> 13:55.720
Shit!

14:29.086 --> 14:32.356
Hey!

15:20.537 --> 15:24.575
Excuse me.

15:34.618 --> 15:37.889
Icing sugar?

15:37.922 --> 15:39.590
What went down here,

15:39.623 --> 15:42.459
it makes no sense.

15:42.492 --> 15:46.463
Bake sale?

15:46.496 --> 15:48.632
I think we should call Gina.

15:50.735 --> 15:52.569
Make the call.

15:52.603 --> 15:55.405
I'll take a price
on the bag man.

15:55.439 --> 15:58.275
Deadly in 24 hours.

15:58.308 --> 16:01.746
Roger.

16:13.858 --> 16:15.927
Ah, fuck.

16:45.288 --> 16:46.556
Hello.

16:46.590 --> 16:49.727
Hello, am I speaking to Derek?

16:49.761 --> 16:52.362
You are. How can I help?

16:57.769 --> 16:59.569
I need private security.

16:59.603 --> 17:01.706
My life is in danger.

17:01.739 --> 17:04.676
Is this in relation
to a criminal incident?

17:04.709 --> 17:06.811
If so, have you
contacted the police

17:06.844 --> 17:08.645
and sought witness protection
through them?

17:08.680 --> 17:10.247
They may be able to help.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.549
It's too late for that, please.

17:12.582 --> 17:16.788
Okay, calm down and listen.

17:16.821 --> 17:18.823
Are you able to meet tomorrow
face-to-face

17:18.856 --> 17:20.992
- at a secure location?
- Yes.

17:25.595 --> 17:27.531
- Thanks again for your help.
- Any time mate.

17:27.564 --> 17:29.967
You guys get off, I've just got
the formalities to deal with.

17:30.001 --> 17:32.670
Okay, bye.

17:32.704 --> 17:35.305
Okay, see you then.

17:35.338 --> 17:37.775
Stay safe.

17:37.809 --> 17:40.878
- Yo.
- I got us our next job.

17:40.912 --> 17:43.246
Do you ever stop?

17:43.280 --> 17:45.248
Only when I'm dead.

17:45.282 --> 17:47.785
Don't tempt me.

19:42.066 --> 19:43.968
Can I have a high-five?

19:44.001 --> 19:45.870
Oh, the other one, yeah.

19:45.903 --> 19:47.972
Both at the same time.

19:48.005 --> 19:52.710
Ah, man, you're too fast for me.

19:52.743 --> 19:54.846
You are just gorgeous
aren't you?

19:54.879 --> 19:56.546
Mmm, not really.

19:56.580 --> 19:58.648
I'm stronger than you but.

19:58.683 --> 19:59.717
Oh, you think so?

19:59.750 --> 20:01.986
I'm a pro wrestler.

20:02.019 --> 20:03.587
Wow.

20:03.620 --> 20:06.489
What have you been
letting her watch on TV?

20:06.523 --> 20:08.068
You don't wanna be something
sweet and innocent

20:08.092 --> 20:10.661
like a nurse
or a flower arranger?

20:10.695 --> 20:12.395
- What!
- What!

20:12.429 --> 20:14.131
Or a violin player?

20:14.165 --> 20:19.502
Aw man, who's that?

20:19.536 --> 20:20.838
Uncle Derek.

20:20.872 --> 20:23.540
Uh, he's always here.

20:23.573 --> 20:25.710
I take it this
isn't a social call?

20:25.743 --> 20:27.845
We've got a half past nine.

20:27.879 --> 20:30.147
Really Derek, on a bank holiday?

20:30.181 --> 20:33.150
Hey, duty calls.

20:33.184 --> 20:34.624
Hurry up and get back
so we can spend

20:34.652 --> 20:36.553
some quality time together.

20:36.586 --> 20:39.957
Aw Emma,
I didn't know you cared.

20:39.991 --> 20:41.591
Not you, dumb-ass.

20:41.625 --> 20:45.196
- Gee, thanks.
- Aw man, here he comes.

20:45.229 --> 20:46.563
Hey man, what's up?

20:46.596 --> 20:49.066
- Hey.
- What!

20:49.100 --> 20:52.036
Shut it.

20:55.873 --> 20:57.507
Morning.

20:57.540 --> 20:59.043
How are we this morning?

20:59.076 --> 21:01.679
- Good.
- You had your breakfast?

21:01.712 --> 21:03.814
What did you have?

21:03.848 --> 21:06.751
- Cupcakes and pancakes.
- Cupcakes and pancakes,

21:06.784 --> 21:10.054
aw he's spoiling you today.

21:17.161 --> 21:18.930
What are you looking at?

21:18.963 --> 21:20.506
Just thinking about
all the things that I would do

21:20.530 --> 21:24.467
if you were naked right now.

21:24.501 --> 21:26.569
And I thought you
were the quiet kind.

21:26.603 --> 21:31.809
Ah, but you don't know me
like I do.

21:31.842 --> 21:35.046
We're gonna be late.

21:35.079 --> 21:39.582
Slave driver.

21:39.616 --> 21:43.087
I need to steal your dad,
is that okay?

21:43.120 --> 21:45.923
We'll be back.

21:49.226 --> 21:51.561
Hey.

21:51.594 --> 21:53.698
You better come back
in one piece.

21:53.731 --> 21:56.934
I'm getting tired
of these sleepless nights.

21:56.968 --> 22:01.806
And I thought you
liked sleepless nights.

22:01.839 --> 22:04.075
I'm serious.

22:06.643 --> 22:10.513
So, what are we going to do
with your hair today?

22:10.547 --> 22:13.117
- Plaits.
- Plaits?

22:13.150 --> 22:15.518
That's easy, I can do that.

22:30.234 --> 22:34.205
How many times have I told you
not to smoke in my fucking car?

22:34.238 --> 22:35.873
What's your problem?

22:35.906 --> 22:37.875
I've not got one.

22:37.908 --> 22:39.877
The smell's driving me wild.

22:39.910 --> 22:40.945
Mm.

22:40.978 --> 22:43.948
Smell that lung cancer.

22:43.981 --> 22:46.083
What doesn't kill yah
makes you stronger, man.

22:46.117 --> 22:48.919
Yeah, but I'm not too sure
that applies to nicotine though.

22:48.953 --> 22:50.263
Where are we going anyway?
I should be with.

22:50.287 --> 22:52.023
- Emma and Maddie today.
- Take it up

22:52.056 --> 22:55.625
- with the trade union.
- Oh, we've got a trade union?

22:55.659 --> 22:58.262
- Yes.
- Wow.

23:08.973 --> 23:12.109
- Is this the place?
- Yup.

23:12.143 --> 23:15.079
No sign of the guy yet though.

23:15.112 --> 23:17.281
We're early.

23:17.314 --> 23:21.152
So, what's the details?

23:21.185 --> 23:25.322
- Some guy wants protection.
- Hasn't he heard of pharmacies?

23:25.356 --> 23:29.160
- Do you mind?
- Nah, you carry on.

23:29.193 --> 23:32.329
Some guy phones me up out of the
blue, looking for protection.

23:32.363 --> 23:35.733
He wasn't very specific but
I get the impression he's, uh,

23:35.766 --> 23:37.701
pissed someone off.

23:37.735 --> 23:40.838
Done a background check,
nothing too serious.

23:40.871 --> 23:42.773
Arrested for witness
intimidation,

23:42.807 --> 23:45.176
no convictions,
seems harmless enough.

23:45.209 --> 23:48.645
Seems like a saint compared
to the people we deal with.

23:48.679 --> 23:53.951
So where the fuck is he?

23:53.984 --> 23:58.389
Aye.

23:58.422 --> 24:03.160
At least you have
family to go home to.

24:03.194 --> 24:04.395
What?

24:04.428 --> 24:07.898
I said at least
you got a family.

24:07.932 --> 24:11.135
Where did that come from?
Rome wasn't built in a day.

24:11.168 --> 24:13.137
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

24:13.170 --> 24:14.705
Well, there's still time
for you yet.

24:14.738 --> 24:16.083
I mean what happened
to that Sandy chick

24:16.107 --> 24:18.209
that you saw a couple of times?

24:18.242 --> 24:20.678
Ah, she woke up one morning
and realized I was an asshole,

24:20.711 --> 24:22.880
I guess.

24:22.913 --> 24:29.954
I'm surprised it took her
so long.

24:29.987 --> 24:31.689
By the way, I've been thinking.

24:31.722 --> 24:33.858
It's probably time
that I stepped back.

24:33.891 --> 24:34.859
Stepped back?

24:34.892 --> 24:40.798
Yeah like, from doing this.

24:40.831 --> 24:44.235
You serious?

24:44.268 --> 24:46.170
You're deserting me?

24:46.203 --> 24:49.406
Look...

24:49.440 --> 24:51.442
I mean, what have I got?

24:51.475 --> 24:52.743
I don't have any family.

24:52.776 --> 24:55.779
I don't have any friends.

24:55.813 --> 25:00.284
Shit.

25:00.317 --> 25:02.162
When I was on tour,
the only thing that stopped me

25:02.186 --> 25:03.954
from putting a bullet
in my fucking head

25:03.988 --> 25:07.158
was putting one
in someone else's.

25:07.191 --> 25:10.728
Now what have I got?

25:10.761 --> 25:12.830
Shit, it still gives me
nightmares.

25:12.863 --> 25:15.699
That's some dark shit you
got going on up in there man.

25:15.733 --> 25:18.469
You really need
to sort that out.

25:18.502 --> 25:20.070
I know.

25:20.104 --> 25:22.907
But who are you to judge, eh?

25:22.940 --> 25:27.945
Honestly, how do you
just get over everything?

25:27.978 --> 25:30.281
You really are
a drama queen aren't you?

25:30.314 --> 25:32.183
Do you wanna end up in a cell?

25:32.216 --> 25:34.261
Cause if we keep taking these
risks, if we keep doing this

25:34.285 --> 25:35.886
that's exactly
what's gonna happen.

25:35.920 --> 25:38.122
Or even worse, we end up dead.

25:38.155 --> 25:40.858
Seriously man, I need to
step back I need a change,

25:40.891 --> 25:43.160
- I gotta get out of this life.
- And play happy family?

25:43.194 --> 25:45.296
Aw, come on, don't talk shit
about what I got

25:45.329 --> 25:49.266
- just cause you...
- Fucking hell.

25:49.300 --> 25:53.270
I'm gonna kill 'em.

26:01.345 --> 26:03.881
Aw, shit.

26:10.154 --> 26:14.058
Shit.

26:19.029 --> 26:20.931
Fuck.

26:34.912 --> 26:37.248
Hello?

26:39.383 --> 26:41.285
Who the fuck is this?

26:41.318 --> 26:45.256
Who the fuck is this?

26:45.289 --> 26:49.093
Where's my money?

26:49.126 --> 26:53.197
I don't know where
your money is friend,

26:53.230 --> 26:55.966
oh wait, is it this briefcase
that's in the car

26:56.000 --> 27:00.237
next to the man
with the slug in his face?

27:00.271 --> 27:04.808
Looks to me to be about...

27:04.842 --> 27:07.478
200 grand in notes.

27:07.511 --> 27:09.847
That's the one.

27:09.880 --> 27:12.082
I want that back.

27:12.116 --> 27:13.917
And I want a house
in Beverly Hills

27:13.951 --> 27:17.921
with ten live-in swimwear models
and a Bentley Continental.

27:17.955 --> 27:20.391
Maybe we can cut a deal.

27:20.424 --> 27:23.027
- We don't do deals.
- We?

27:23.060 --> 27:25.496
And we don't want
mixed up in this shit.

27:25.529 --> 27:27.531
Bit late for that.

27:27.564 --> 27:29.933
Look at the stiff on the seat,

27:29.967 --> 27:33.504
I wouldn't rely on
my restraint if I were you.

27:33.537 --> 27:35.506
Maybe I give my shooter
two new targets

27:35.539 --> 27:38.175
and let her retrieve the money.

27:38.208 --> 27:39.953
Yeah, well why don't you
tell that little minx

27:39.977 --> 27:43.147
to come down here and we can
settle this mano-a-mano.

27:43.180 --> 27:45.916
Or better yet, why don't you
stop being a coward

27:45.949 --> 27:48.152
and show yourself, asshole.

27:48.185 --> 27:52.256
Or you can come to the club,
The Fair Maiden

27:52.289 --> 28:00.164
and we can settle this amicably
with a bit of class.

28:00.197 --> 28:05.369
Twenty minutes.

28:05.402 --> 28:09.440
Aw, he hung up.

28:12.209 --> 28:14.945
Well, we're in the shit.

28:14.978 --> 28:17.281
Now it gets interesting.

28:17.314 --> 28:22.453
Look at these.

28:22.486 --> 28:24.188
I have a feeling
I know what's gonna happen

28:24.221 --> 28:28.959
when I phone our contact.

28:36.200 --> 28:39.002
Let's get outta here
before the cops show.

28:57.454 --> 29:00.357
- On the right, - Clear.

29:04.027 --> 29:06.530
Shoot first,
ask questions later?

29:06.563 --> 29:10.634
What better way
to crash a party?

29:10.668 --> 29:13.370
On my mark.

29:13.404 --> 29:16.674
One, two.

29:19.643 --> 29:22.045
Hit it.

29:38.028 --> 29:40.464
I'm out.

29:40.497 --> 29:42.266
What you thinking?

29:45.737 --> 29:48.238
Yo?

29:48.272 --> 29:51.108
Aye.

30:01.151 --> 30:04.621
Come on, buddy.

30:04.656 --> 30:07.357
Area's clean.

30:15.466 --> 30:18.035
Nice work.

30:19.403 --> 30:23.040
You must be the fair maiden.

30:23.073 --> 30:26.643
Oh how nice of you to notice.

30:30.547 --> 30:33.484
Hi.

30:33.517 --> 30:38.322
First he hides behind a phone,

30:38.355 --> 30:41.793
now he hides behind a screen.

30:41.826 --> 30:47.164
So you're the men
who opened Pandora's box.

30:47.197 --> 30:49.667
Where's my money?

30:49.701 --> 30:54.772
This guy's such a douche.

30:54.806 --> 30:57.107
And you must be his pet monkey.

30:57.140 --> 31:01.078
Oh.

31:01.111 --> 31:06.316
Monkey, monkey.

31:06.350 --> 31:09.654
You do realize
she's probably a fed, right?

31:16.360 --> 31:21.331
I'm not.

31:21.365 --> 31:23.333
She looks like a spook.

31:23.367 --> 31:27.137
Ooh.

31:27.170 --> 31:31.575
Sorry babe,
hope we didn't blow your cover.

31:31.608 --> 31:35.312
Why don't you blow me?

31:35.345 --> 31:37.782
Mmm.

31:37.815 --> 31:40.317
Now that's a thought.

31:40.350 --> 31:42.519
I work for Mr. Big here.

31:47.659 --> 31:52.563
It's funny, from here
Mr. Big looks kind of small.

32:00.672 --> 32:03.875
Boys...

32:08.345 --> 32:13.183
You startled me.

32:16.219 --> 32:19.791
We're gonna turn this shit
into a bloodbath, motherfucker.

32:24.261 --> 32:26.664
Look around,

32:26.698 --> 32:30.668
looks as if you already have.

32:30.702 --> 32:33.270
Yes police?

32:33.303 --> 32:37.541
I'd like to report a mass
shooting by two crazed gunmen.

32:45.349 --> 32:47.752
We'll be back.

32:51.355 --> 32:57.729
You can count on that, compadre.

32:57.762 --> 33:00.197
And you, call me too.

33:00.230 --> 33:01.699
Call me too.

33:13.610 --> 33:16.647
Hey, she was a cougar.

33:16.681 --> 33:18.491
Yeah you might wanna set
your sights a little higher

33:18.515 --> 33:20.283
than the local assassin.

33:20.317 --> 33:23.186
Man, why you always
gotta bringing me down?

33:23.220 --> 33:26.556
It's so easy.

33:28.693 --> 33:30.594
Derek!

33:45.542 --> 33:47.444
Time to extract our money
from the clutches

33:47.477 --> 33:50.213
of a couple of undesirables.

33:50.247 --> 33:52.549
Bought time
for milk and cookies.

33:52.582 --> 33:54.819
Maybe not...

33:54.852 --> 33:57.587
do you know who these guys are?

33:57.621 --> 34:00.323
Let me guess, this is the part
where you tell me

34:00.357 --> 34:01.959
I've made a fatal mistake
and these guys

34:01.993 --> 34:04.461
aren't to be fucked with,

34:04.494 --> 34:08.598
experts in martial arts,
weapons, explosives?

34:08.632 --> 34:10.835
Blah, blah, fucking blah.

34:10.868 --> 34:12.970
Something like that.

34:13.004 --> 34:17.942
Ex-military, now working as
freelance security personnel.

34:17.975 --> 34:21.311
The confidence to come in here,
guns blazing.

34:21.344 --> 34:24.514
Yeah, for some kind of police
protection, co-operation

34:24.548 --> 34:27.551
I suspect in there,
in case floors get sticky.

34:27.584 --> 34:32.522
Where did you get that file?

34:32.556 --> 34:34.458
I have my sources.

34:34.491 --> 34:38.428
You just have to know
where to look.

34:38.462 --> 34:41.699
See, that's what I love about
you,

34:41.733 --> 34:44.534
it's that air of mystery.

34:44.568 --> 34:47.637
You're a regular
little Maleficent.

34:47.672 --> 34:51.274
Maybe they were right
about you being a spook.

34:51.308 --> 34:52.910
I'll get the clean-up crew,
shall I?

34:52.944 --> 34:55.847
- Changing the subject.
- Right.

34:55.880 --> 34:58.381
Let's just say that
that was the case.

34:58.415 --> 35:00.918
What? I just print it off
on the office photocopier

35:00.952 --> 35:03.755
and bring it in
on letter-headed paper?

35:03.788 --> 35:07.959
Signed by the chief
Cunt-stubble.

35:07.992 --> 35:09.927
Maybe that's your angle?

35:09.961 --> 35:12.629
You've got a very
vivid imagination.

35:12.663 --> 35:16.399
Always.

35:16.433 --> 35:19.070
So, what about these three?

35:19.103 --> 35:21.038
We'll just drop them
in a few kegs of sulfuric

35:21.072 --> 35:23.440
and spread the slop on the farm?

35:23.473 --> 35:27.577
And just like that,
they're gone.

35:27.611 --> 35:29.714
So I'm guessing the other two
are going to be snuffed

35:29.747 --> 35:32.917
in a more clinical fashion?

35:32.950 --> 35:37.955
We'll let the boys
have some fun with them first.

35:37.989 --> 35:41.358
Well, watch your back.

35:41.391 --> 35:44.594
Ironic coming from a sniper,
don't you think?

35:44.628 --> 35:47.631
I like to keep my distance.

35:47.665 --> 35:50.802
I had noticed.

35:50.835 --> 35:52.369
<i>Ciao.</i>

35:55.740 --> 35:57.474
<i>Ciao.</i>

36:06.818 --> 36:08.886
I need a pick-up.

36:08.920 --> 36:11.989
Two barrels.

36:12.023 --> 36:15.625
The kind that you need
gloves to handle.

37:08.578 --> 37:10.413
All there?

37:17.989 --> 37:20.523
Shh.

37:33.004 --> 37:36.640
Surprise!

37:39.877 --> 37:42.046
So...

37:42.079 --> 37:50.079
Why did you two decide
to ruin my bank holiday Monday?

37:50.655 --> 37:52.690
Why do you kill the guy
in the car?

37:52.723 --> 37:56.060
Shut that holier than thou shit.

37:56.093 --> 37:58.663
He betrayed me.

37:58.696 --> 38:01.065
I bury traitors.

38:01.098 --> 38:03.768
I spit in the face of snitches.

38:03.801 --> 38:08.471
I sever ties and then
bask in their goddamn blood.

38:22.086 --> 38:26.190
Bask in their goddamn blood.

38:26.223 --> 38:28.859
Ah fuck.

38:28.893 --> 38:34.497
Aw, fuck I love this
theatrical panto villain shit.

38:34.531 --> 38:39.870
I could've been in Lear.

38:39.904 --> 38:42.273
This japs right here,

38:42.306 --> 38:46.010
he doesn't even know
who Shakespeare is.

38:46.043 --> 38:51.648
All his mum taught him
was how to suck her titties

38:51.682 --> 38:56.721
and then run his bathwater.

38:56.754 --> 39:00.191
So many unanswered questions,
eh?

39:00.224 --> 39:03.894
Why did that guy
take that money from me?

39:03.928 --> 39:08.631
How did your photographs
end up in that briefcase?

39:08.666 --> 39:13.636
Your guess is as good as mine.

39:13.671 --> 39:15.840
Does it matter?

39:15.873 --> 39:18.909
Well, I guess not.

39:18.943 --> 39:20.211
<i>Que sera.</i>

39:21.712 --> 39:23.114
<i>Que sera.</i>

39:27.184 --> 39:28.585
I know why.

39:28.618 --> 39:31.621
Take it to your
grave, sweetheart.

39:31.655 --> 39:36.060
Me no give no fucks.

39:36.093 --> 39:38.595
Hold him.

39:46.704 --> 39:50.908
Could you hold that for me,
dear?

39:53.878 --> 39:55.655
You don't want to make
the whole speech-thing last

39:55.679 --> 39:58.816
just a little longer so
we can think up an escape plan?

39:58.849 --> 40:04.188
Just checking.

40:07.158 --> 40:09.126
Ah-ha.

40:16.333 --> 40:19.003
Gutted.

40:19.036 --> 40:21.939
Absolutely gutted for you.

40:31.782 --> 40:37.188
Oh, thank you very much.

40:46.664 --> 40:51.102
You all right?

40:51.135 --> 40:55.306
Yeah.

40:55.339 --> 40:57.408
I will be in about
three seconds.

40:57.441 --> 40:58.709
Two, one.

41:02.880 --> 41:04.748
Ugh.

41:34.011 --> 41:36.013
Oh, shit!

41:36.046 --> 41:37.214
Oh, shit!

41:54.298 --> 41:58.235
Ugh, ugh, ugh.

42:07.011 --> 42:08.011
Yo, you good?

42:10.447 --> 42:11.749
Yo, you good?

42:11.782 --> 42:13.851
Yeah, I've got Colossus.

42:13.884 --> 42:14.919
On you go.

43:14.812 --> 43:17.982
Oops.

43:18.015 --> 43:23.220
Butter fingers.

43:29.493 --> 43:32.363
Ah, ah.

43:37.368 --> 43:41.005
Ah.

43:41.038 --> 43:45.109
Oh, shit!

45:12.162 --> 45:17.968
Hello, is that one Oliver Payne?

45:18.001 --> 45:20.137
My friends call me Oapi.

45:20.170 --> 45:22.639
So I'm guessing
you're not one of them.

45:22.674 --> 45:25.476
Forgive me, we haven't met.

45:25.509 --> 45:29.213
My name is Barnes.

45:29.246 --> 45:31.315
Where's my money, Barnes?

45:31.348 --> 45:32.950
Now don't let your
emotions get the...

45:32.983 --> 45:36.120
I want that back, what the fuck
do you think this is?

45:36.153 --> 45:37.321
Are you goading me?

45:37.354 --> 45:39.022
Are you looking for
some kind of reaction?

45:39.056 --> 45:40.624
Because you'll get one.

45:40.658 --> 45:42.660
The deal that went south,

45:42.694 --> 45:45.195
that was a...

45:45.229 --> 45:48.132
let's call him former employee,

45:48.165 --> 45:50.934
a bag man, who thought
he could fuck me over.

45:50.968 --> 45:54.638
- And instead he fucked me over.
- Exactly.

45:54.672 --> 45:57.474
You were just collateral damage.

45:57.508 --> 45:59.309
Have you any idea
how long it takes

45:59.343 --> 46:02.045
to scrape together 200 G's?

46:02.079 --> 46:03.647
I've worked my way up
from nothing.

46:03.681 --> 46:06.684
I finally get together
enough to do something big

46:06.718 --> 46:11.488
and then some aging con artist
comes and takes it away.

46:11.522 --> 46:14.625
My heart bleeds.
Where's my fucking cello?

46:14.659 --> 46:19.296
Look Oliver, don't pour your
heart out to me I can't take it.

46:19.329 --> 46:22.533
You patronizing motherfucker!

46:22.566 --> 46:27.271
Now listen,
I've got your money back.

46:27.304 --> 46:29.741
It's right here with me.

46:29.774 --> 46:31.608
There's no issue
in meeting you and giving you

46:31.642 --> 46:35.279
the briefcase back,
intact, as is.

46:35.312 --> 46:37.281
You can even check every
dollar bill to make sure

46:37.314 --> 46:40.651
the right mugshot's
on the front.

46:40.685 --> 46:43.353
Or?

46:43.387 --> 46:45.122
You knew there was an 'or',

46:45.155 --> 46:47.659
I like that Oliver.

46:47.692 --> 46:52.463
Or we could proceed
with the deal as planned.

46:52.496 --> 46:56.300
I bring you the required
amount of narcotics,

46:56.333 --> 46:59.603
plus an extra half key
for your time wasted

46:59.636 --> 47:02.072
and inconvenience.

47:02.105 --> 47:05.042
How does that sound?

47:05.075 --> 47:09.179
How do I know the same shit
won't go down again?

47:09.213 --> 47:13.317
Hence why I'm agreeing
to be there in person.

47:13.350 --> 47:15.552
You could have
just kept the money.

47:15.586 --> 47:18.121
What, and forego
any future business?

47:18.155 --> 47:20.457
Tarnish my reputation?

47:20.491 --> 47:22.426
And what about the bag man?

47:22.459 --> 47:24.228
Sorry?

47:24.261 --> 47:26.129
Where is he now?

47:26.163 --> 47:29.066
Oh, we caught up with him
earlier this morning.

47:29.099 --> 47:34.037
Relieved of his desire
to keep breathing.

47:34.071 --> 47:35.405
Good.

47:35.439 --> 47:37.641
Just sorry
I wasn't there myself.

47:37.675 --> 47:39.443
Oh, believe me Oliver,

47:39.476 --> 47:42.814
if I could, you would have
had a ringside seat.

47:42.847 --> 47:45.182
So do we have a deal?

47:45.215 --> 47:49.721
Yeah, I'm keen to proceed
with the original plan.

47:49.754 --> 47:53.390
Excellent, I'll give you
a meeting point.

47:53.423 --> 47:57.294
You are going to love this.

47:57.327 --> 47:59.096
Shouldn't it be on my turf?

47:59.129 --> 48:01.565
Why take the risk?

48:01.598 --> 48:03.768
'Suppose it's risky either way.

48:03.801 --> 48:07.271
Makes sense right, Oapi?

48:07.304 --> 48:08.639
Yeah, okay.

48:08.673 --> 48:12.142
So, where and when?

48:12.175 --> 48:14.378
I hope you've got
your sea legs on.

48:14.411 --> 48:16.380
Friend.

48:30.193 --> 48:32.563
You smash another window in here
by breaking like King Kong

48:32.596 --> 48:34.631
I'm gonna dock
your wages, Grande.

48:46.577 --> 48:51.114
Do you know your trouble,
Grande?

48:51.148 --> 48:54.585
You lack finesse.

48:54.618 --> 48:57.220
Who needs finesse when you're
seven foot tall?

48:57.254 --> 48:58.690
Bullshit.

49:02.192 --> 49:04.394
You know that sayin',

49:04.428 --> 49:07.497
"The bigger they are,
the harder they fall?"

49:07.531 --> 49:09.275
Most people think that means
the bigger they are,

49:09.299 --> 49:11.501
the harder it is
to knock you down.

49:14.237 --> 49:16.808
But it doesn't.

49:16.841 --> 49:19.276
Means the bigger you are,

49:19.309 --> 49:21.578
the harder you hit the deck.

49:23.848 --> 49:26.550
Is that a threat?

49:26.583 --> 49:28.151
Look at you,

49:28.185 --> 49:29.519
those two walk in
playin' heroes,

49:29.553 --> 49:31.521
and you let one of 'em
walk out the door.

49:35.793 --> 49:37.795
You're losin' your touch.

49:37.829 --> 49:38.629
You're losin' it.

49:38.663 --> 49:41.699
Who the fuck do you
think you are?

49:41.733 --> 49:45.202
You let one of them
walk out that door.

49:45.235 --> 49:47.604
You are losin' your touch.

49:53.711 --> 49:56.380
Do you wanna hear a joke?

49:56.413 --> 49:58.348
Do I look like I like jokes?

49:58.382 --> 49:59.751
Come on, Grande,

49:59.784 --> 50:01.551
you're a funny guy!

50:01.585 --> 50:03.821
You appreciate good humor.

50:03.855 --> 50:05.757
You'll like this one.

50:06.891 --> 50:09.359
Here goes.

50:09.393 --> 50:11.261
What do tall people do

50:11.294 --> 50:14.431
when they see
an aeroplane comin'?

50:16.433 --> 50:19.569
Heard it a million times before.

50:29.613 --> 50:31.949
Maybe you're not losin'
your touch after all.

51:07.985 --> 51:10.320
Yeah?

51:10.353 --> 51:12.023
Put him on.

51:12.056 --> 51:13.658
It's for you.

51:13.691 --> 51:15.559
It's the crazy merc.

51:18.930 --> 51:20.665
Roadkill!

51:21.933 --> 51:25.903
You're out of your depth.

51:25.937 --> 51:28.005
Fuck you!

51:28.039 --> 51:29.874
What do you want?

51:29.907 --> 51:32.476
You killed someone close to me.

51:32.509 --> 51:35.680
I want your life.

51:35.713 --> 51:37.514
The only thing
you're gonna receive

51:37.547 --> 51:39.382
is a bullet

51:39.416 --> 51:42.452
<i>compris entre les oreilles.</i>

51:44.354 --> 51:45.123
You ever heard of the saying,

51:45.156 --> 51:46.858
"Never underestimate
your problem

51:46.891 --> 51:49.761
or your ability
to deal with it?"

51:49.794 --> 51:52.329
I'm your problem now.

51:52.362 --> 51:54.498
Yeah, a minor one,

51:54.531 --> 51:58.602
like sand in your shoe
after a day at the beach.

51:58.635 --> 52:00.504
Buddy burned to a crisp, is he?

52:09.046 --> 52:11.314
Whoever you are,

52:11.348 --> 52:13.350
I'm gonna find you.

52:13.383 --> 52:16.319
I'm gonna rip
your fucking head off.

52:16.353 --> 52:18.923
Everything you have,
I'm gonna take it from you.

52:18.956 --> 52:21.558
And you wanna know
the worst part?

52:21.591 --> 52:23.326
Oh, enlighten me.

52:25.462 --> 52:27.497
You ain't gonna see it coming.

52:38.976 --> 52:41.411
I'll look forward to ya.

53:05.703 --> 53:07.504
Sorry, mate.

53:24.621 --> 53:26.123
Here to finish the job?

53:36.167 --> 53:37.869
I've got a family.

53:54.517 --> 53:55.720
Ah!

54:14.138 --> 54:15.673
I ain't got any reasons left

54:15.706 --> 54:17.507
not to pull this trigger.

54:17.540 --> 54:20.144
Wait, I can get you Barnes.

54:20.177 --> 54:23.147
Why the fuck would you do that?

54:23.180 --> 54:25.482
My brother died
in that explosion.

54:25.515 --> 54:26.784
What do you mean?

54:26.817 --> 54:28.485
He worked for Barnes.

54:28.518 --> 54:30.453
I want him just as much as you.

54:30.487 --> 54:33.057
Yeah? Why should I believe that?

54:33.090 --> 54:34.759
Don't believe it,

54:34.792 --> 54:37.962
but I'm your ticket
to catching Barnes.

54:45.937 --> 54:47.504
He deals in cocaine,

54:47.537 --> 54:50.607
prides himself on always
selling the purest form.

54:50.640 --> 54:52.609
He calls it white gold.

54:52.642 --> 54:55.612
He's dangerous,
shows no remorse.

54:55.645 --> 54:56.914
And you work for him.

54:56.948 --> 54:58.816
Hey, I just collect debts,

54:58.849 --> 55:00.517
rough people up a bit,

55:00.550 --> 55:02.153
sometimes it gets messy.

55:02.186 --> 55:03.888
Same old bullshit, eh?

55:03.921 --> 55:07.258
Grew up in a bad
neighborhood, joined a gang,

55:07.291 --> 55:09.559
got into drugs?

55:09.592 --> 55:13.164
Actually, I was a sniper
in the armed forces,

55:13.197 --> 55:15.166
amongst other things.

55:15.199 --> 55:16.701
And when I came back,

55:16.734 --> 55:18.669
I couldn't get a job.

55:18.703 --> 55:22.106
And my brother
had joined a gang.

55:22.139 --> 55:24.075
I was in the army.

55:24.108 --> 55:26.744
I didn't become
an assassin, though.

55:26.777 --> 55:28.813
Yes, you did, it's just before,

55:28.846 --> 55:30.948
you thought you were
killing for a cause,

55:30.982 --> 55:32.883
and now you're just
killing for money.

55:32.917 --> 55:34.551
It's all the same!

55:34.584 --> 55:35.953
You're a sellout.

55:35.987 --> 55:37.955
You're a fucking mercenary

55:37.989 --> 55:40.057
just like me.

55:40.091 --> 55:42.893
All the people that I've killed
deserved what they got,

55:42.927 --> 55:44.527
- mostly.
- What, because your government

55:44.561 --> 55:45.628
told you?

55:45.663 --> 55:47.231
No, because my
conscience told me.

55:49.300 --> 55:51.534
You don't have a conscience.

55:51.568 --> 55:53.304
Yeah, not today.

55:53.337 --> 55:55.605
A lot of people died,
good or bad,

55:55.638 --> 55:57.540
including Derek.

55:57.574 --> 56:00.745
If you wanna help me,
then tell me where he's at.

56:04.115 --> 56:07.318
His club, the Fair Maiden,

56:07.351 --> 56:09.552
it's named after a boat,

56:09.586 --> 56:11.889
and it's moored just
along this coastline.

56:14.225 --> 56:16.861
I can get you in.

56:16.894 --> 56:20.097
That's where all the major
weight deals take place.

56:20.131 --> 56:22.900
Okay.

56:22.933 --> 56:25.669
But if you're a red herring

56:25.703 --> 56:28.773
sent to lure me in,

56:28.806 --> 56:30.841
you're gonna die with them.

57:03.274 --> 57:05.242
I'll take position on the roof.

57:05.276 --> 57:09.046
I've never done well
in close combat situations.

57:09.080 --> 57:10.714
Yeah, I noticed that.

57:16.320 --> 57:19.390
But remember,

57:19.423 --> 57:22.393
save him for me.

57:22.426 --> 57:24.128
Whatever you say.

57:24.161 --> 57:26.397
And, uh, watch my back
in there 'cause I,

57:26.430 --> 57:29.700
I wanna come back out.

57:46.884 --> 57:48.419
Fuckin' hell.

57:50.121 --> 57:52.723
What the fuck
happened to you, man?

57:52.756 --> 57:54.058
- Yeah.
- Oh!

57:54.091 --> 57:55.693
- Ooh.
- Oh, shit.

57:59.330 --> 58:02.700
Broke my phone when that
big prick landed on me.

58:02.733 --> 58:03.944
By the time I got
'round to the base,

58:03.968 --> 58:05.302
I saw you leavin' with her,

58:05.336 --> 58:07.771
so I thought I'd follow.

58:07.805 --> 58:09.273
You switch sides, cougar bitch?

58:09.306 --> 58:11.876
I'd eat you for breakfast.

58:13.878 --> 58:17.148
Break your virginity
all over again.

58:17.181 --> 58:18.648
Mm.

58:21.752 --> 58:23.187
What?

58:23.220 --> 58:25.422
Did you really get
that in the explosion?

58:25.456 --> 58:28.792
Or is that really
a repetitive strain injury?

58:28.826 --> 58:32.229
You really need to stop
with your sex jokes, man.

1:00:36.353 --> 1:00:38.989
Housekeeping.

1:01:01.312 --> 1:01:05.049
What the fuck is that?

1:01:05.082 --> 1:01:08.285
What the fuck?

1:01:08.319 --> 1:01:12.022
What the... What's going on in?

1:01:52.963 --> 1:01:56.467
Are you in position?

1:01:56.500 --> 1:01:58.102
Standby.

1:01:58.135 --> 1:02:00.003
Ready when you are.

1:02:07.679 --> 1:02:10.080
Yo, man, about earlier,

1:02:10.114 --> 1:02:11.281
I thought you were gone.

1:02:11.315 --> 1:02:14.151
So, I could hear
the cops comin',

1:02:14.184 --> 1:02:18.155
self-preservation
and all that shit.

1:02:18.188 --> 1:02:21.659
Don't worry about it, man,
you stuck to the plan.

1:02:21.693 --> 1:02:23.394
Speakin' of which,

1:02:23.427 --> 1:02:25.095
what's the plan for this?

1:02:25.129 --> 1:02:27.665
Shoot first,
ask questions later?

1:02:27.699 --> 1:02:30.234
Yeah.

1:02:30.267 --> 1:02:33.237
Oh, here you go,

1:02:33.270 --> 1:02:34.938
put this on.

1:02:37.007 --> 1:02:39.176
Have you lost the plot?

1:02:39.209 --> 1:02:40.644
It's got a trackin' device in it

1:02:40.678 --> 1:02:43.580
so our sharpshooter
knows not to shoot us.

1:02:48.585 --> 1:02:50.954
Yo, it ain't even Christmas.

1:02:52.623 --> 1:02:54.258
Fuck it.

1:03:08.205 --> 1:03:11.175
You truly are
as mad as they say.

1:03:15.179 --> 1:03:16.980
Any samples?

1:03:19.183 --> 1:03:22.687
What, you want to
try before you buy?

1:03:22.720 --> 1:03:24.455
Think I'm gonna need to.

1:03:42.339 --> 1:03:43.339
Looks good.

1:03:47.277 --> 1:03:49.079
Tastes pretty good too.

1:03:51.749 --> 1:03:55.152
Then I think we're done here.

1:03:55.185 --> 1:03:56.186
Yeah.

1:03:58.489 --> 1:04:00.190
Ho, ho, ho.

1:04:00.224 --> 1:04:02.259
Merry fucking Christmas.

1:04:02.292 --> 1:04:05.462
We got gifts
for the whole family.

1:04:05.496 --> 1:04:08.332
Hey, it's you two.

1:04:08.365 --> 1:04:10.334
Well, I'll be damned.

1:04:15.072 --> 1:04:16.473
Who the fuck
are these two clowns?

1:04:16.507 --> 1:04:19.543
Hey, don't ask me, bro,
I just work here.

1:04:29.353 --> 1:04:32.222
Mm, you know what, Derek,

1:04:32.256 --> 1:04:34.558
I think it's gonna be
a white Christmas, after all.

1:05:06.858 --> 1:05:09.526
Oh, oh, Nick.

1:05:09.560 --> 1:05:11.571
I think it's time we gave
these boys their presents.

1:05:11.595 --> 1:05:13.798
Oh, yeah, shit, I almost forgot.

1:05:51.401 --> 1:05:52.401
Ah, fuck!

1:06:41.686 --> 1:06:42.687
Ah!

1:06:45.422 --> 1:06:46.724
Ah, fuck.

1:07:11.481 --> 1:07:13.851
Ah!

1:07:19.523 --> 1:07:21.458
Oh, shush.

1:07:33.938 --> 1:07:37.240
Oh, that is some good shit.

1:07:41.045 --> 1:07:42.747
Filthy habit.

1:07:44.882 --> 1:07:46.751
I've got movement
coming up the hall,

1:07:46.784 --> 1:07:49.286
door on your left.

1:08:18.816 --> 1:08:21.551
You head on,
I'll clean up in here.

1:08:40.104 --> 1:08:41.906
Well, well, well.

1:08:48.045 --> 1:08:50.313
He's all yours.

1:08:50.347 --> 1:08:52.616
Looks like it's just you and me.

1:09:02.559 --> 1:09:04.061
Now it's just me.

1:09:22.612 --> 1:09:24.749
Hey.

1:09:24.782 --> 1:09:25.649
Ugh!

1:09:25.683 --> 1:09:27.885
Oh, I'm sorry, darling.

1:09:27.919 --> 1:09:29.553
No, no, no, no, no!

1:09:37.627 --> 1:09:39.039
Hate to see a pretty
face go to waste.

1:09:39.063 --> 1:09:40.097
No, no, no, no!

1:09:44.836 --> 1:09:46.838
Fuck.

1:09:52.143 --> 1:09:53.610
Shit.

1:10:42.660 --> 1:10:44.128
Oh, shit!

1:11:00.577 --> 1:11:01.478
Go, on.

1:11:01.511 --> 1:11:03.147
Fuckin' kill him.

1:11:16.193 --> 1:11:17.995
He's a big fucker, isn't he?

1:11:18.029 --> 1:11:20.831
Tap out.

1:11:20.865 --> 1:11:23.633
Ah, round two with Donkey Kong.

1:12:23.894 --> 1:12:26.263
Oh!

1:12:26.297 --> 1:12:29.033
- Oh, shit, we need to fix this.
- Get up, get up.

1:12:29.066 --> 1:12:30.143
- We need to work together!
- Don't hold my fucking

1:12:30.167 --> 1:12:31.268
hand, man.

1:13:11.809 --> 1:13:13.210
No, no, no, no!

1:13:47.044 --> 1:13:49.847
- You did that on purpose.
- Hold on, hold on.

1:13:49.880 --> 1:13:51.614
- Oh, fuckin' shit.
- Human centipede,

1:13:51.648 --> 1:13:54.885
- eat your heart out.
- Get this fucker off me.

1:13:57.254 --> 1:13:59.890
- You want a hand?
- Get him the fuck off me.

1:13:59.924 --> 1:14:02.026
You sure? You look like
you're enjoying this.

1:14:02.059 --> 1:14:03.294
Come on.

1:14:03.327 --> 1:14:06.197
Come on, little lad.

1:14:09.767 --> 1:14:11.168
Oh.

1:14:17.908 --> 1:14:19.243
That was fun.

1:14:22.446 --> 1:14:24.882
Nice work, boys.

1:14:24.915 --> 1:14:27.351
Your employment's
now terminated.

1:14:29.220 --> 1:14:32.189
It's over, man.

1:14:39.096 --> 1:14:40.197
- Shit.
- This is security.

1:14:40.231 --> 1:14:42.800
We've had noise complaints.

1:14:42.833 --> 1:14:44.268
What are you doing? Cease fire!

1:14:44.301 --> 1:14:45.803
Open the door, please.

1:14:45.836 --> 1:14:47.371
Cease fire!

1:14:47.404 --> 1:14:49.273
She's already gone.

1:14:54.745 --> 1:14:56.714
I'm gonna have to
make the call, man.

1:14:56.747 --> 1:14:59.984
Gonna have to, man, sorry.

1:15:04.421 --> 1:15:07.057
Hello, yes, can I get
an ambulance, please?

1:15:07.091 --> 1:15:08.425
- Come on, man.
- I told you,

1:15:08.459 --> 1:15:10.227
we were gonna end up
dead or in a cell.

1:15:10.261 --> 1:15:13.197
It looks like I got the short
end of the stick, man.

1:15:13.230 --> 1:15:14.932
Is that another sex joke?

1:15:14.965 --> 1:15:17.735
- Yeah, little bit.
- Yes, yes, we're, uh,

1:15:17.768 --> 1:15:19.370
at a ship in the docks.

1:15:19.403 --> 1:15:21.472
Yes.

1:15:21.505 --> 1:15:23.440
Yes, we're in the docks,

1:15:23.474 --> 1:15:25.976
Pentland docks,
on the south side.

1:15:26.010 --> 1:15:26.877
Pentland docks, yes,

1:15:26.911 --> 1:15:27.845
there's a ship
called the Fair Maiden.

1:15:27.878 --> 1:15:29.780
We've got a shot
to the neck, I need...

1:15:29.813 --> 1:15:31.916
Oh, shit.

1:15:31.949 --> 1:15:34.418
I need assistance quick, please!

1:15:37.021 --> 1:15:38.923
What the fuck
are you laughin' at?

1:15:38.956 --> 1:15:40.958
That tracker,

1:15:40.991 --> 1:15:43.160
it wasn't in your hat,
it's in your vest.

1:15:45.029 --> 1:15:46.230
Are you for real?

1:15:46.263 --> 1:15:47.264
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1:15:47.298 --> 1:15:48.299
Hey, hey!

1:15:48.332 --> 1:15:50.834
You were wearin' that too!

1:15:50.868 --> 1:15:52.736
- Hold on, hold on.
- I know, I know.

1:15:52.770 --> 1:15:54.939
Oh.

1:15:54.972 --> 1:15:57.341
- You're all right.
- Oh, man.

1:15:57.374 --> 1:15:58.342
Hey, hey, hey!

1:15:58.375 --> 1:16:00.744
Don't make me have to
give you mouth to mouth.

1:16:00.778 --> 1:16:01.922
- Yeah, that's...
- You know I will.

1:16:01.946 --> 1:16:05.282
That's never worked out
well for you in the past.

1:16:05.316 --> 1:16:06.417
Hey!

1:16:06.450 --> 1:16:08.385
She broke her ankle.

1:16:08.419 --> 1:16:10.988
Don't make me laugh, man.

1:16:11.021 --> 1:16:13.224
Hey, come on, come on,
man, keep pressure.

1:16:13.257 --> 1:16:16.060
Come on, man, come on,
you're good, you're good.

1:16:16.093 --> 1:16:18.162
Don't worry,
you're just going into

1:16:18.195 --> 1:16:20.197
a little spat of insanity.

1:16:20.231 --> 1:16:21.932
You're losin'
blood to the brain.

1:16:21.966 --> 1:16:23.934
You're good, man.

1:16:23.968 --> 1:16:26.203
Mind you, it might help you.

1:16:26.237 --> 1:16:27.204
You're good.

1:16:27.238 --> 1:16:28.939
Hey, hey, come on,

1:16:28.973 --> 1:16:30.441
hold on.

1:16:30.474 --> 1:16:31.408
You're good.

1:16:31.442 --> 1:16:33.010
You're good, hey, stay with me.

1:16:33.043 --> 1:16:34.044
Come on.

1:16:34.078 --> 1:16:36.313
That's it, good man.

1:16:36.347 --> 1:16:38.115
Stay, hey, stay with me.

1:16:38.148 --> 1:16:39.383
Stay with me.

1:16:39.416 --> 1:16:40.951
You're good, man.

1:16:40.985 --> 1:16:43.120
You're good.

1:16:46.090 --> 1:16:47.391
Shit.

1:16:49.860 --> 1:16:52.296
Fuck.

1:16:52.329 --> 1:16:53.564
Stay with me.

1:16:53.597 --> 1:16:54.999
You're good, man.

1:16:55.032 --> 1:16:56.567
Hold on.

1:16:56.600 --> 1:16:57.968
You're good.

1:17:03.607 --> 1:17:06.477
Is Daddy ready to go home yet?

1:17:11.348 --> 1:17:13.917
Daddy's been in an accident,

1:17:13.951 --> 1:17:16.253
and he's been very badly hurt.

1:17:16.287 --> 1:17:18.188
Will he be okay?

1:17:21.325 --> 1:17:23.894
Well, the doctors are
doing the best they can.

1:17:28.866 --> 1:17:31.335
We just have to be patient.

1:17:31.368 --> 1:17:34.405
Why is it taking so long?

1:17:37.408 --> 1:17:39.310
Well, that's because
he needs an extra big

1:17:39.343 --> 1:17:43.013
sticky plaster.

1:17:43.047 --> 1:17:47.284
Look, Mummy, over there,
there's toys!

1:17:47.318 --> 1:17:49.286
Well, you can go play with them

1:17:49.320 --> 1:17:53.157
as long as you can
still see Mummy.

1:17:53.190 --> 1:17:57.494
But I want to be here
when Daddy comes back!

1:17:57.528 --> 1:17:59.863
Don't worry,
I'll come and get you.

1:18:03.400 --> 1:18:06.236
Mummy says I can
play with the toys!

1:18:06.270 --> 1:18:07.104
Oh, yeah?

1:18:07.137 --> 1:18:09.440
Wow, on you go.

1:18:29.026 --> 1:18:31.328
You're gonna pace
a hole in that floor.

1:18:33.263 --> 1:18:34.898
What do you expect?

1:18:42.707 --> 1:18:45.042
How could you let this happen?

1:18:48.278 --> 1:18:50.447
Emma, I'm sorry, I just...

1:18:50.481 --> 1:18:52.950
Fuck your sorry.

1:18:52.983 --> 1:18:55.386
Is that all you've
got to say is "Sorry?"

1:19:03.026 --> 1:19:06.463
He could be lyin' on a slab
in an hour's time.

1:19:10.033 --> 1:19:11.635
Come here.

1:19:20.745 --> 1:19:24.481
All I wanted was a nice,
quiet bank holiday...

1:19:26.316 --> 1:19:28.118
just the three of us.

1:19:37.695 --> 1:19:39.329
I know.

1:19:41.432 --> 1:19:42.700
It's okay.

1:19:44.535 --> 1:19:48.539
He's gonna make it
out the other side.

1:19:48.572 --> 1:19:51.074
You know how stubborn
that prick is.

1:19:53.177 --> 1:19:55.112
I know he's alive.

1:19:58.048 --> 1:20:00.984
Except you don't, do you?

1:20:08.058 --> 1:20:10.327
Why do it?

1:20:10.360 --> 1:20:13.597
Why keep doing it?

1:20:13.630 --> 1:20:15.299
It's funny,

1:20:15.332 --> 1:20:17.568
he said the same thing
to me this morning.

1:20:20.070 --> 1:20:22.072
What?

1:20:22.105 --> 1:20:24.074
That he wants out.

1:20:30.815 --> 1:20:33.617
It's a bit late for that.

1:20:33.650 --> 1:20:35.753
He told me he wants
to spend more time

1:20:35.787 --> 1:20:38.255
with you and Maddy.

1:20:42.059 --> 1:20:44.528
And I threw a little bitch fit

1:20:44.561 --> 1:20:47.064
accusing him of deserting me.

1:20:49.299 --> 1:20:54.238
I just don't think
he meant it like this.

1:20:54.271 --> 1:20:55.606
Yeah, well,

1:20:55.639 --> 1:20:58.308
he always has to
have his own way.

1:21:01.411 --> 1:21:03.213
Some people just

1:21:03.247 --> 1:21:07.351
can't see themselves
doing anything else.

1:21:07.384 --> 1:21:10.220
Nick, he could never
work in an office.

1:21:10.254 --> 1:21:13.290
He'd be climbin' the walls.

1:21:13.323 --> 1:21:14.659
Pushin' paper,

1:21:14.692 --> 1:21:17.762
going to board meetings?

1:21:17.795 --> 1:21:20.531
That's like going
from running to crawling.

1:21:24.736 --> 1:21:29.339
What's wrong with crawlin'?

1:21:29.373 --> 1:21:30.708
Nothin'.

1:21:34.278 --> 1:21:36.714
That's Nick out of surgery.

1:21:36.748 --> 1:21:39.249
- Can I see him?
- Yeah, come with me.

1:21:39.283 --> 1:21:40.852
Maddy?

1:21:40.885 --> 1:21:44.054
Police are downstairs, sir,
they'd like to speak with you.

1:21:51.562 --> 1:21:52.562
I know.

1:22:12.316 --> 1:22:13.718
Hey, ya.

1:22:13.751 --> 1:22:16.219
Yay, Mummy, he's woken up!

1:22:23.895 --> 1:22:26.731
How you feelin' today?

1:22:26.764 --> 1:22:30.668
For the first time,
the pain in my neck isn't you.

1:22:30.702 --> 1:22:33.270
Don't joke.

1:22:33.303 --> 1:22:35.181
Last night when I said
I wanted us to spend more

1:22:35.205 --> 1:22:37.341
quality time together,

1:22:37.374 --> 1:22:40.210
this isn't quite
what I had in mind.

1:22:44.949 --> 1:22:46.818
Daddy, what would
you do tomorrow

1:22:46.851 --> 1:22:50.220
if you knew you
weren't going to wake up?

1:22:50.253 --> 1:22:51.689
Wow.

1:22:51.723 --> 1:22:55.459
You're so deep for
a five-year-old, you know that?

1:22:55.492 --> 1:22:59.429
Um, never go to sleep?

1:22:59.463 --> 1:23:01.666
Hey, look, check out this scar.

1:23:01.699 --> 1:23:03.801
- What?
- What?

1:23:03.835 --> 1:23:05.903
Did Uncle Derek do that to you?

1:23:09.941 --> 1:23:13.678
No, Uncle Derek just likes
gettin' Daddy into trouble.

1:23:13.711 --> 1:23:17.882
Yeah, well, Daddy keeps on
going along with it, come here.

1:23:20.584 --> 1:23:22.619
Let's get you a sweet, shall we?

1:23:22.653 --> 1:23:24.321
- Yes.
- Good.

1:23:28.926 --> 1:23:30.560
Is it finished?

1:23:32.964 --> 1:23:34.866
Just one last thing.

1:23:40.504 --> 1:23:42.239
Come on.

1:24:00.892 --> 1:24:02.526
Yo!

1:24:02.559 --> 1:24:04.294
You gonna tell us
what we're doing here,

1:24:04.327 --> 1:24:05.706
or are you having
one of your moments?

1:24:05.730 --> 1:24:08.398
Yeah, in a minute.

1:24:08.432 --> 1:24:11.535
- Where are we going?
- Reference library.

1:24:11.568 --> 1:24:12.770
Ha, I knew it.

1:24:12.804 --> 1:24:14.972
Your copy of
the Kama Sutra's overdue.

1:24:15.006 --> 1:24:16.416
- Or is that mine?
- Will you stop with

1:24:16.440 --> 1:24:18.976
the sex jokes for one minute?

1:24:21.879 --> 1:24:24.448
Great, he's having a moment.

1:24:24.481 --> 1:24:27.517
I hate it when he's like this.

1:24:30.788 --> 1:24:34.257
So, the dead guy in the car
was our contact, right?

1:24:34.291 --> 1:24:35.927
Yeah, he worked for Barnes,

1:24:35.960 --> 1:24:37.862
and he wanted out,
so he steals Barnes' money

1:24:37.895 --> 1:24:39.697
in order to buy protection.

1:24:39.731 --> 1:24:40.932
The irony.

1:24:40.965 --> 1:24:42.308
Yeah, and Barnes
was gonna make sure

1:24:42.332 --> 1:24:43.668
that he didn't
make it out alive.

1:24:43.701 --> 1:24:45.469
See, at least
that's what I thought.

1:24:45.502 --> 1:24:46.704
Somethin' wasn't right,

1:24:46.738 --> 1:24:50.742
so I had our favorite reporter
do a little bit of digging.

1:24:50.775 --> 1:24:52.409
See the guy in the car?

1:24:52.442 --> 1:24:54.879
He died eight years ago.

1:24:54.912 --> 1:24:56.714
Oh, and he also died
four years ago.

1:24:56.748 --> 1:25:01.651
In fact, he's got a little
bit of a habit of dying.

1:25:01.686 --> 1:25:02.954
So you think that guy

1:25:02.987 --> 1:25:05.322
organized the entire thing?

1:25:05.355 --> 1:25:06.657
Yeah, maybe.

1:25:06.691 --> 1:25:08.391
Check this out.

1:25:08.425 --> 1:25:11.394
So, I reckon he
set us up to kill Barnes

1:25:11.428 --> 1:25:13.831
so that he could
make off with the money.

1:25:13.865 --> 1:25:16.701
That, and all the other assets
there was never any record of

1:25:16.734 --> 1:25:18.602
because it was all drug money.

1:25:20.437 --> 1:25:23.808
And that bitch was in on it too.

1:25:23.841 --> 1:25:25.442
Why help us out though?

1:25:25.475 --> 1:25:28.780
Spin that yarn
about her brother?

1:25:28.813 --> 1:25:29.981
Keep tabs on us?

1:25:30.014 --> 1:25:31.716
Make sure we kill Barnes?

1:25:31.749 --> 1:25:33.626
We get the blame for
killin' the guy in the car.

1:25:33.650 --> 1:25:34.928
We were at the scene
of the crime.

1:25:34.952 --> 1:25:37.789
She absolves herself
of any involvement.

1:25:39.757 --> 1:25:43.326
She had the perfect opportunity
to get rid of the both of us,

1:25:43.360 --> 1:25:44.929
leave no witnesses.

1:25:44.962 --> 1:25:45.963
So, what?

1:25:45.997 --> 1:25:49.934
She didn't expect us
to unravel their plan?

1:25:49.967 --> 1:25:51.477
Yeah, I don't think
that she was plannin' on

1:25:51.501 --> 1:25:52.970
either of us survivin'.

1:25:55.505 --> 1:25:57.440
Yeah.

1:25:57.474 --> 1:25:59.342
We've been played.

1:25:59.376 --> 1:26:00.376
Yup.

1:26:03.681 --> 1:26:06.416
I planted one of those
trackers on her van.

1:26:06.449 --> 1:26:09.787
It's at a ranch just
north of the city.

1:26:09.821 --> 1:26:11.856
I'm pissed off, man.

1:26:11.889 --> 1:26:15.126
I say that we finish
the fuckin' job.

1:26:15.159 --> 1:26:16.794
What?

1:26:18.628 --> 1:26:20.898
Yeah, it's just not
as cute when you do it.

1:26:24.068 --> 1:26:25.736
Nice.

1:26:25.770 --> 1:26:28.638
It's not like I'm
tryin' to be cute.

1:26:57.034 --> 1:26:59.971
According to the GPS,
they're right up ahead.

1:27:00.004 --> 1:27:02.907
Two seconds, there's a woman,
just pull over here.

1:27:02.940 --> 1:27:04.675
And I thought I was desperate.

1:27:04.709 --> 1:27:06.844
Excuse me, um,
do you live up here?

1:27:06.878 --> 1:27:08.411
Uh, no, I'm just a cleaner.

1:27:08.445 --> 1:27:11.414
The owner's, um,
back at the farm cottage.

1:27:11.448 --> 1:27:13.985
Uh, okay, do you know
who the owner is?

1:27:14.018 --> 1:27:16.020
Um, it was a Mr. Barnes,

1:27:16.053 --> 1:27:18.856
but the farm's
recently changed hands.

1:27:18.890 --> 1:27:20.801
Okay, um, do you know
how many people are up there

1:27:20.825 --> 1:27:21.826
by any chance?

1:27:21.859 --> 1:27:24.929
Um, about a half a dozen?

1:27:26.797 --> 1:27:28.799
What's this about?

1:27:28.833 --> 1:27:30.634
Uh, we're just here
for a business meeting.

1:27:30.668 --> 1:27:31.845
Um, thanks very much
for your help.

1:27:31.869 --> 1:27:33.170
No problem.

1:27:36.707 --> 1:27:38.009
Do you think we should have, uh,

1:27:38.042 --> 1:27:39.476
told her not to
bother comin' back

1:27:39.509 --> 1:27:41.188
since she probably
doesn't have an employer

1:27:41.212 --> 1:27:43.147
in the next five minutes?

1:27:43.180 --> 1:27:44.081
By the way,

1:27:44.115 --> 1:27:46.851
you're fired!

1:27:46.884 --> 1:27:49.653
Ugh, fuck you.

1:27:49.687 --> 1:27:52.123
You're unreal, you know that?

1:28:02.667 --> 1:28:04.168
Uh, hello, hi.

1:28:04.201 --> 1:28:05.803
Uh, yeah, there's two,

1:28:05.836 --> 1:28:07.848
there's two guys on their way
up to the farm cottage

1:28:07.872 --> 1:28:09.140
just to let you know.

1:28:10.975 --> 1:28:12.609
Thank you, Carol.

1:28:17.614 --> 1:28:18.983
Round up the men.

1:28:21.152 --> 1:28:23.788
I want these two
irritating fucks

1:28:23.821 --> 1:28:27.024
buried beneath
the cow shit before sundown.

1:28:29.260 --> 1:28:34.131
This is what happens
when you fail to do your job,

1:28:34.165 --> 1:28:35.700
sweetheart.

1:29:45.002 --> 1:29:48.205
Go, move!

1:29:59.283 --> 1:30:03.054
- Get up there and cover me!
- Keep firing!

1:30:41.725 --> 1:30:43.694
I thought we had something.

1:30:45.663 --> 1:30:47.031
Not this time.

1:31:32.076 --> 1:31:35.179
I told you I was gonna
turn this into a blood bath.

1:32:30.834 --> 1:32:32.136
Ah!

1:32:34.405 --> 1:32:35.906
Fuck!

1:32:50.321 --> 1:32:52.790
Thought you were
supposed to be dead?

1:32:52.823 --> 1:32:55.059
Slight oversight on my part.

1:32:57.228 --> 1:33:00.464
Let me rectify that for you.

1:33:00.497 --> 1:33:02.299
Ah!

1:33:06.036 --> 1:33:08.138
Ah!

1:33:15.546 --> 1:33:17.848
I'll give you
a cut of the money.

1:33:17.881 --> 1:33:19.917
I knew you were
going to say that.

1:33:19.950 --> 1:33:22.319
We can make a deal.

1:33:22.353 --> 1:33:24.088
We don't do deals.

1:33:36.400 --> 1:33:38.869
Try and stay dead this time.

1:33:58.555 --> 1:34:00.024
You kill her?

1:34:00.057 --> 1:34:02.893
Yeah.

1:34:02.926 --> 1:34:04.595
Aw, man.

1:34:04.628 --> 1:34:05.429
A shame.

1:34:05.462 --> 1:34:08.299
You could have been
good together.

1:34:08.332 --> 1:34:11.001
Come off it, mate.

1:34:11.035 --> 1:34:13.237
How did the conman take it?

1:34:13.270 --> 1:34:16.106
Eh, badly.

1:34:16.140 --> 1:34:18.375
Good, they deserved it.

1:34:40.998 --> 1:34:42.866
Think we should
bring that cleaner back.

1:35:06.957 --> 1:35:08.425
Ooh!

1:35:08.459 --> 1:35:09.960
Yeah!

1:35:21.472 --> 1:35:23.607
Hey, are we really done?

1:35:28.946 --> 1:35:31.048
Was this really
our last job together?

1:35:35.018 --> 1:35:37.054
See you Monday.
