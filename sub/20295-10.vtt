"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.233 --> 00:36.333
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.333 --> 00:38.900
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:38.900 --> 00:40.733
in a court of law.

00:42.100 --> 00:44.367
-I'm actually lucky
that I got with this department.

00:44.367 --> 00:46.833
It's the third largest
sheriff's office in the U.S.

00:46.833 --> 00:49.367
and we have
a huge area to cover.

00:49.367 --> 00:51.000
As a deputy out here,

00:51.000 --> 00:54.500
you've got to really know how
to communicate to people and--

00:54.500 --> 00:57.267
at times de-escalate because
your backup may not be there

00:57.267 --> 00:59.233
for, you know, 10 minutes.

01:00.400 --> 01:02.200
It looks like we got
a truck up here

01:02.200 --> 01:03.733
parked behind
this closed business.

01:03.733 --> 01:05.800
It's pretty early
in the morning.

01:05.800 --> 01:09.200
I'll make sure that
he's not trying to break
into the place or something.

01:09.200 --> 01:11.567

Suspicious vehicle.

-Yes, ma'am. It is.

01:37.700 --> 01:39.300
-Change of mind.

01:39.300 --> 01:42.467
Can I have a unit move
towards the 600 Eastern lot?

01:42.467 --> 01:44.733
-(radio beeps)
-That's clear. Hold the channel.

01:44.733 --> 01:45.967
Let me see your hands.

01:45.967 --> 01:47.700
-Man on radio:
En route from storefront.

02:00.600 --> 02:02.067
-Step over here.

02:02.067 --> 02:04.100
Step over here.
Let me see your hands.

02:04.100 --> 02:06.067

02:06.067 --> 02:08.433
-43 North 21.
I have one at gunpoint.

02:08.433 --> 02:10.067
He's being non-compliant.

02:10.067 --> 02:11.833
Put your hands on the truck.

02:11.833 --> 02:13.367
-Crazy, man.

02:13.367 --> 02:16.867
-Woman on radio:
So it is gonna be on a
Chevy Silverado silver in color?

02:22.067 --> 02:23.967
-Man--

02:23.967 --> 02:26.233
-Step 'em up.
I've got one resisting.

02:26.233 --> 02:27.500
Get on the ground.

02:27.500 --> 02:29.767
-Man. Man, what

02:29.767 --> 02:31.567
-Get on the ground
or you gonna get tasered!

02:31.567 --> 02:33.833
-Bitch, I'm--
-Get on the ground now!

02:33.833 --> 02:36.133
-Man! Bitch! You ain't got
to (bleep) put hands on me.

02:36.133 --> 02:37.800
-Get down on the ground.
-Man, do you see this?

02:37.800 --> 02:40.100
Bitch, you ain't gotta
do that to my hands.

02:40.100 --> 02:41.167
Stop.

02:41.167 --> 02:42.600
-Get on the ground!
Turn on your stomach!

02:42.600 --> 02:44.400
-I'm on the ground, bitch!
-Get on your stomach!

02:44.400 --> 02:45.967
Turn on your stomach!

02:45.967 --> 02:47.700
-I'm on my stomach.

02:47.700 --> 02:49.567
-You're about to
get tasered, dude.
-For what?

02:49.567 --> 02:52.167
-Get on your face now
and put your hands
behind your back!

02:53.200 --> 02:54.367

03:06.133 --> 03:08.067
-Woman on radio:

03:08.067 --> 03:10.067

-All right, all right.
All right, man! All right!

You pop up on me again,
you're gonna get it again.

That's affirmative.

03:41.200 --> 03:42.700

03:42.700 --> 03:45.700
At the 15900 block
of East Freeway.

03:45.700 --> 03:47.767
-Get up, dude.
Get up.

03:47.767 --> 03:50.067
-Man, I need a hospital.
-Roll over and get up.

03:50.067 --> 03:52.600
-I need a hospital.
I need a hospital, man! Damn!

-Get up.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.067
-You gonna tase me again?
-Pull your knees up
to your chest.

03:56.067 --> 03:57.567
-I need a hospital.

03:57.567 --> 03:59.067

04:08.200 --> 04:09.967
Hey, dude...
All right, it's over with.

04:09.967 --> 04:12.300
-Can I have
a (bleep) hospital, man?
-Hey, it's over with, dude.

04:12.300 --> 04:13.533
-No, it's not over with!

04:13.533 --> 04:15.300
-Yeah, it is.
-No, it's not!

04:15.300 --> 04:17.967
-Listen to me.
Whose truck is this?

04:17.967 --> 04:19.533
-Man, I'm not--
I don't know!

04:19.533 --> 04:21.733
I'm just-- I'm not
in the driver's side.

04:21.733 --> 04:23.267
I'm waiting on
the dude to come back.

04:23.267 --> 04:25.167
-All right.

04:25.167 --> 04:26.900
Hey.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.633
Who was driving the vehicle?

04:28.633 --> 04:30.800
-J.C.
-Who's J.C.?

04:30.800 --> 04:33.767
-J.C. Ow!
-Okay.

04:33.767 --> 04:36.567
-Man, look how you got
these (bleep) cuffs on me, man!

04:36.567 --> 04:37.900
-Yeah.
-Yeah, what?

04:37.900 --> 04:39.700
-Yeah, you gonna resist me?
-Don't you go to class?

04:39.700 --> 04:41.367
Man, come on, man!
-You're gonna resist me...

04:41.367 --> 04:43.167
-Dawg, was I (bleep)
resisting you?
-Yes.

04:43.167 --> 04:45.700
Yes, when you pulled away
from me after I get
the first cuff on.

04:45.700 --> 04:48.067
-Man, you bitch-slamming
me into the ground, bro!
-Okay.

04:48.067 --> 04:49.433
-You needed to--
-All right, come on.

04:49.433 --> 04:50.633
Walk this way, brother.

04:51.867 --> 04:53.533
-Man...

04:53.533 --> 04:55.833
-Come on. Come on.
-Man, you got these (bleep)
cuffs on me like this, bro.

04:55.833 --> 04:57.667
-The reason why
I had you step out

04:57.667 --> 05:01.533
is because my dispatch
advised me the vehicle
was stolen. Okay?

05:01.533 --> 05:03.567
-I didn't know
the vehicle was stolen.
-Remember I told you

05:03.567 --> 05:05.400
to step out, I tell you to
put your hands on the car

05:05.400 --> 05:07.233
and you refuse to comply--

05:07.233 --> 05:08.900
-I put-- I had my hands up.
-No, you didn't.

05:08.900 --> 05:11.367
-You refused to comply, okay?
-All right. I guess on...

05:11.367 --> 05:15.100
-Okay? You started resisting me,
tensing up on me--
-But how did I tense up?

05:15.100 --> 05:17.733
-I get one cuff on you
and you jerk your hand away.

05:17.733 --> 05:20.600
-No, you just picked me up
by my (bleep) cuffs, man!

05:20.600 --> 05:23.067
-It's all on tape, bro.
-The sergeant's here.

05:23.067 --> 05:24.667
He's the only one
that was in the vehicle.

05:24.667 --> 05:26.067
He was in the passenger side.

05:26.067 --> 05:29.467
-It's okay, Sarge.
I'm doing everything
he's saying, Sarge.

05:29.467 --> 05:32.433
-Right now--
-He tried to pick me up
by my wrists.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.233
-Hold still.
-And tased me.

05:34.233 --> 05:37.533
-Before you say anything else--
-Man, you need to fire
this dude right here.

05:37.533 --> 05:39.467
-You have the right
to remain silent.
Anything you say...

05:39.467 --> 05:41.800
-Ain't no right
to remain silent, man.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.567
-You have the right
to have an attorney present

05:43.567 --> 05:44.800
prior to and during
your questioning.

05:44.800 --> 05:46.133
-You got the right
to talk like a man.

05:46.133 --> 05:47.533
-If you cannot
afford an attorney,

05:47.533 --> 05:49.467
one will be-- for you
at no cost.

05:49.467 --> 05:51.767
Do you understand these rights
as I've read them to you?

05:51.767 --> 05:53.533
-(mumbles)
-You understand your rights?

05:53.533 --> 05:54.833
-Man, (bleep) you.

05:54.833 --> 05:56.333
-Hey, let me I.D. him.
-All right.

05:56.333 --> 05:57.700
I don't have I.D. on him.

05:57.700 --> 05:59.867
-I have, uh,
tell him I have a warrant.

05:59.867 --> 06:02.267
-Okay. If you got a warrant,
you got a warrant,

06:02.267 --> 06:03.900
but don't lie
about your name.

06:03.900 --> 06:06.067
I mean, we're gonna identify you
one way or another.

06:06.067 --> 06:08.900
-Sorry. I'm not trying
to go to jail.

06:08.900 --> 06:11.133
-Well, again, that's done.
Especially you have a warrant.

06:11.133 --> 06:13.400
That part's done.
There's no taking
that back.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.367
There's no changing it.
Okay?

06:15.367 --> 06:16.767
-What am I going
to jail for?

06:16.767 --> 06:20.433
-Well, if for anything,
you sitting in the stolen car.

06:20.433 --> 06:21.900
But you said it yourself,
you got a warrant.

06:21.900 --> 06:23.567
So, you're at least going
to jail for the warrant.

06:23.567 --> 06:25.700
But you're sitting alone
in a stolen truck, dude.

06:25.700 --> 06:27.333
-I was in the passenger
side, sir.

06:27.333 --> 06:29.633
-You're the sole occupant
of a stolen vehicle.

06:29.633 --> 06:31.133
Hang tight, dude.

06:33.433 --> 06:35.367
-We got a positive I.D.
-Okay.

06:35.367 --> 06:37.633
-His name is Reginald.

06:37.633 --> 06:39.867
-Okay.
-He has a parole violation

06:39.867 --> 06:42.500
as of last month
on the 17th.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.500
-What was he out
on parole for? Do we know?

06:44.500 --> 06:46.100
-Dangerous drugs.
-Dangerous drugs?

06:46.100 --> 06:47.767
Yeah, because he's so combative,

06:47.767 --> 06:49.400
why don't you just
take him straight down?

06:49.400 --> 06:51.267
-Straight to IPC?
-Straight to IPC.

06:51.267 --> 06:52.600
Let's not mess around
with this guy.

06:52.600 --> 06:54.567
We're just gonna
let the jail handle him.
-All right.

06:57.400 --> 06:58.900
-I've been with
the Lubbock Police Department

06:58.900 --> 07:00.767
for a little over
10 years now.

07:00.767 --> 07:03.100
I'm currently assigned
to the Crime Suppression Unit

07:03.100 --> 07:05.500
which is a unit
that kind of deals

07:05.500 --> 07:06.933
with a little bit
of everything.

07:06.933 --> 07:10.933
Drugs, burglaries, auto thefts.

07:10.933 --> 07:14.633
A little bit of everything,
so an all-inclusive unit.

07:14.633 --> 07:16.800
-(radio beeps)
-72-55.

07:16.800 --> 07:18.300
Behind the stolen vehicle.

07:18.300 --> 07:19.733
Pulling into Clapp Park.

07:20.967 --> 07:22.767
I just spotted what I think
to be is gonna be

07:22.767 --> 07:24.200
a stolen vehicle.

07:24.200 --> 07:26.667
It's gonna be a black
Buick Lucerne.

07:26.667 --> 07:28.367
We're gonna go see
if we can't stop it.

07:28.367 --> 07:30.733
At least run a tag
and make sure that
that's not the vehicle.

07:30.733 --> 07:32.333
-(siren blares)

07:43.867 --> 07:45.300
-Let me see your hands now!

07:45.300 --> 07:47.667
Let me see your hands!
Turn the car off now!

07:47.667 --> 07:49.500
-(mumbles)
-Keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

07:49.500 --> 07:51.800
Get out of the car.

07:51.800 --> 07:54.067
Lay on the ground.
Lay on the ground now.

07:54.067 --> 07:56.333
Get on the ground.
Get on the ground.

07:56.333 --> 07:57.967
Put your hands
behind your back now.

07:57.967 --> 07:59.600
Put your hands
behind your back.

08:12.067 --> 08:14.667
-What'd I get
stopped for, man?

08:16.100 --> 08:17.367
-Is this your car?

08:17.367 --> 08:19.800
-No, sir. Somebody just
gave me the keys and was like,

08:19.800 --> 08:21.733
"Here, man.
You can have this car, man."

08:21.733 --> 08:24.967
And I was like, "All right."
And I asked him if it's stolen.

08:24.967 --> 08:26.633
He was like, "No."

08:26.633 --> 08:29.200
-Okay, well, hold on.
This vehicle's stolen.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.133
-Okay, so the dude
that gave me this car

08:31.133 --> 08:33.833
was talking about,
"This is my car, man.

08:33.833 --> 08:36.633
"Here you go. Here you go.
Here goes the keys."

08:36.633 --> 08:38.600
-How many keys do
you have in your pocket?

08:38.600 --> 08:40.367
Those, that's to
my house, man.

08:40.367 --> 08:42.833
-That's to your house?
-I didn't steal this car, sir.

08:42.833 --> 08:44.467
-Why are they all loose?

08:44.467 --> 08:47.067
-'Cause I like keeping
my keys loose, man.

08:47.067 --> 08:48.467
-Do you?
-Yes, sir.

08:48.467 --> 08:50.667
He just gave me the keys
and was like, "Here, man."

08:50.667 --> 08:52.933
-Well, I mean,
do you know the guy?
Do you know him by name?

08:52.933 --> 08:54.600
-No, sir. He was just...
he was just like,

08:54.600 --> 08:56.067
"Here, man.
You want this car?"

08:56.067 --> 08:58.267
I was like, "Yeah, man."
-Step right back here
with him, okay?

08:58.267 --> 09:00.133
-I didn't see him no more, man.
-You didn't see him?

09:00.133 --> 09:01.433
-You got an I.D. on you?
-No, sir.

09:01.433 --> 09:03.567
-Right now we're just
gonna inventory the vehicle,

09:03.567 --> 09:06.700
see if there's...

09:06.700 --> 09:08.467
any weapons, drugs.

09:08.467 --> 09:09.833
Anything like that
in the vehicle.

09:09.833 --> 09:13.100
So we have the victim's name
on this credit card right here.

09:14.600 --> 09:18.067
That's the name
that's on the report
for the stolen vehicle.

09:18.067 --> 09:20.700
He's claiming of course that
he didn't steal this vehicle.

09:20.700 --> 09:23.100
But yet the vehicle
was just recently stolen

09:23.100 --> 09:26.067
and he's already in it.
And again, like I said,

09:26.067 --> 09:29.300
the victim's credit cards
are in the vehicle.

09:29.300 --> 09:32.433
One of the first things
is on a stolen vehicle,

09:32.433 --> 09:34.633
a lot of times is
the credit cards are used.

09:37.733 --> 09:39.433
-(radio beeps)
-Can you contact the victim

09:39.433 --> 09:41.067
and see if they can
come pick up their car?

09:41.067 --> 09:42.233
We're gonna be
at Clapp Park.

09:42.233 --> 09:44.767
We have the keys
and her credit card

09:44.767 --> 09:46.633
is also in the vehicle as well.

09:46.633 --> 09:49.067
-Woman: 10-4.
-Adam, I'm gonna give you
the benefit of the doubt.

09:49.067 --> 09:50.233
If you got it
from somebody else,

09:50.233 --> 09:52.333
I need to know
what happened today.
Specifically.

09:52.333 --> 09:54.333
-Well, I was walking
down over there

09:54.333 --> 09:56.500
on East Broadway
next-- by Sonic

09:56.500 --> 09:59.433
and some dude,
I don't know his name,

09:59.433 --> 10:00.533
just stopped me.

10:00.533 --> 10:01.900
I don't know
what he looks like

10:01.900 --> 10:04.700
'cause it was just--
everything just happened
so fast.

10:04.700 --> 10:06.867
He gave me the keys, was like,

10:06.867 --> 10:08.200
"Do you want
this car, man?"

10:08.200 --> 10:11.533
I was like, "Yeah, sure."
You know, "I'll take the car."

10:11.533 --> 10:14.600
He said that it was his, that
it wasn't stolen or anything,

10:14.600 --> 10:16.800
so that's why I'm complying
and everything,

10:16.800 --> 10:18.433
because I didn't know
that the car was stolen.

10:18.433 --> 10:19.933
You know what I mean?

10:19.933 --> 10:21.667
-Adam, let me ask you
a question real quick.
You're smart, right?

10:21.667 --> 10:23.700
-Yes, sir.
-If I came up
to you and said that

10:23.700 --> 10:25.500
I was gonna
give you an item

10:25.500 --> 10:29.100
worth several thousand dollars
and you'd never met me before,

10:29.100 --> 10:32.433
and I was gonna give you
something worth several
thousand dollars,

10:32.433 --> 10:34.667
would that be
normal to you?

10:34.667 --> 10:37.167
-...No.
-Okay.

10:37.167 --> 10:40.633
So, did you think it was odd
that some guy that

10:40.633 --> 10:42.467
you don't even remember
what he looks like--

10:42.467 --> 10:44.233
You can't tell me
a race, can you?

10:44.233 --> 10:45.933
-Uh, he was Mexican.
I know that.

10:45.933 --> 10:48.233
-He was Mexican? Okay.
-That's it, man. And--

10:48.233 --> 10:50.567
-But you don't know
what he looked like?
You can't tell me a d--

10:50.567 --> 10:52.367
-I don't know. No, sir.
-A short description? Nothing?

10:52.367 --> 10:54.733
From my standpoint,
okay, that just absolutely
makes no sense.

10:54.733 --> 10:57.467
-Don't accept nothing
for something if you don't know
if it's stolen.

10:57.467 --> 10:59.500
-Right. If it's too good
to be true, it probably is,
right?

10:59.500 --> 11:00.900
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

11:00.900 --> 11:02.567
-Like how you said you were
gonna give me benefit of doubt

11:02.567 --> 11:04.133
and I'm gonna give you
the benefit of doubt.

11:04.133 --> 11:06.267
I was complying and everything.
-But the benefit of the doubt,

11:06.267 --> 11:07.700
a lot of that is
you have to give me

11:07.700 --> 11:09.700
a little bit of information
that actually makes some sense.

11:09.700 --> 11:12.133
-Okay, that's--
that's all I can give you.
-The statute in the...

11:12.133 --> 11:14.367
in the state of Texas is
is that you're in possession

11:14.367 --> 11:15.867
of a stolen vehicle, okay?

11:15.867 --> 11:18.300
That you're un--
you're using that vehicle

11:18.300 --> 11:20.767
without any authorization
from the owner, okay?

11:20.767 --> 11:22.733
-Okay.
-So, you don't have to
be the one that takes it.

11:22.733 --> 11:24.267
You have to be
the one that's what?

11:24.267 --> 11:26.700
-Take it back.
-Driving it, right?

11:26.700 --> 11:28.067
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

11:28.067 --> 11:30.133
So right now,
that's what you're
under arrest for, okay?

11:30.133 --> 11:31.600
Is this your car?
-Woman: Yes.

11:31.600 --> 11:33.700
-Man:
I wasn't there when it--
My girlfriend was in the car.

11:33.700 --> 11:35.400
-Is this your shirt?
-That's mine.

11:35.400 --> 11:37.067
-Did you see it?
Are you sure?

11:37.067 --> 11:39.133
-Mm-hmm. We got
some clothes in the trunk.
We was going to do laundry.

11:39.133 --> 11:40.900
-Yeah. Your girlfriend,
what's her name?
-Jasmine.

11:40.900 --> 11:42.067
-You're Jasmine?
-Yeah.

11:42.067 --> 11:43.867
-He was wearing
your boyfriend's shirt.

11:43.867 --> 11:45.800
Here, you can come over here.
Take a look through your car

11:45.800 --> 11:48.100
and just make sure everything
appears to be in order.

11:48.100 --> 11:51.633
What happens is a lot of times
with our stolen vehicles

11:51.633 --> 11:54.067
they've already cleaned out
the glove-box and everything.

11:54.067 --> 11:56.267
They're looking
for an item that
they can steal really quick.

11:56.267 --> 11:58.233
And that's your card
right there on the--

11:58.233 --> 11:59.333
That's your credit card, right?

11:59.333 --> 12:00.733
-Yes, it is.
-Okay.

12:00.733 --> 12:03.500
-Um, everything else
appear to be in the car?

12:03.500 --> 12:05.767
-Mmm...
-There was a bunch
of keys in his pocket.

12:05.767 --> 12:06.967
Do you know
anything about those?

12:06.967 --> 12:08.933
-Yeah, he took all my keys
off of the--

12:08.933 --> 12:10.133
-Your keyring?
-Yeah.

12:10.133 --> 12:12.400
-Yeah, he said he likes
to keep his keys loose.

12:12.400 --> 12:14.733
Can you tell me a little bit
about how this happened?

12:14.733 --> 12:16.933
-I was parked at El Pino.

12:16.933 --> 12:19.533
Um , I was in there
literally three minutes

12:19.533 --> 12:22.167
and I came back out
and my car was gone.

12:22.167 --> 12:24.267
-Did you leave
your car running?
-I did.

12:24.267 --> 12:26.133
But I never thought,
like, that would happen.

12:26.133 --> 12:27.933
-Yeah, it's a crime
of opportunity.

12:27.933 --> 12:29.667
We should be able to
leave our cars unlocked,

12:29.667 --> 12:31.367
but that's just not
the day and age we live in, so.

12:31.367 --> 12:32.400
All right.

12:36.733 --> 12:38.767
All right, Adam,
this is the deal, okay?

12:38.767 --> 12:40.100
You can go ahead
and step out for me.

12:40.100 --> 12:41.933
Our victim said
that that's his shirt,

12:41.933 --> 12:45.467
so we're gonna go ahead
and we'll take it off, okay?

12:45.467 --> 12:47.667
You weigh 140 pounds
and you're gonna wear--

12:47.667 --> 12:49.533
-There are other shirts
like this around the world, man.

12:49.533 --> 12:52.467
Come on now.
-Well, they are,
but they aren't 3XL.

12:52.467 --> 12:53.833
-(handcuffs unclick)

12:56.100 --> 12:57.800
-Do me a favor.
Get on your knees real quick.

12:59.100 --> 13:01.100
Cross your legs.

13:01.100 --> 13:02.467
Cross your ankles.

13:02.467 --> 13:04.467
Cross your ankles.

13:04.467 --> 13:06.067
-Man on radio:
52-14.

13:06.067 --> 13:08.333
-You are being arrested
for the unauthorized use
of the motor vehicle.

13:08.333 --> 13:09.667
You understand that, right?
-Yes, sir.

13:09.667 --> 13:11.133
-When something is
too good to be true,

13:11.133 --> 13:12.867
then it probably is.

13:16.100 --> 13:17.933
-My dad worked here
for 32 years

13:17.933 --> 13:19.933
and, you know,
he really instilled

13:19.933 --> 13:22.067
the importance
of safety to me

13:22.067 --> 13:24.067
and how important it is
to get home to your family

13:24.067 --> 13:25.200
at the end
of each shift.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.067
You know, he said that
there's no amount of dope

13:27.067 --> 13:30.533
or anything out here that's
worth losing your life over.

13:30.533 --> 13:33.433
-Man on radio:
White male with no shirt on.
Bald head.

13:33.433 --> 13:35.833
No seatbelt on the driver.

13:35.833 --> 13:37.367
-We'll stop it
right up here.

13:37.367 --> 13:40.400
Gonna stop this pickup truck
right in front of us.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.567
Um, the driver's not
wearing his seatbelt.

13:42.567 --> 13:44.233
We also have
a stop bar violation

13:44.233 --> 13:45.833
on the last
stop sign back there,

13:45.833 --> 13:47.467
so gonna make contact with him.

13:49.333 --> 13:50.400
-(car door closes)

13:52.900 --> 13:55.333
-How's it going, boss?
What you up to, man?

13:55.333 --> 13:57.300
You mind just shutting
your radio off for me?

13:57.300 --> 13:58.833
What you up to, man?

13:58.833 --> 14:01.100
Just chilling. Just got off work
not too long ago.

14:01.100 --> 14:02.733
-Look man, not a big deal--

14:02.733 --> 14:04.833
You mind rolling that window
down for my partner?

14:04.833 --> 14:07.433
-This door.
-It's rolling.

14:07.433 --> 14:09.733
-Hey, not a big deal, man,
but when you were
just on Florence,

14:09.733 --> 14:12.833
you didn't have your seatbelt on
until you passed my partner,
then you put it on.

14:12.833 --> 14:14.467
-Okay.
-You got your license
on you, man?

14:14.467 --> 14:15.867
-Yes, sir.

14:17.067 --> 14:19.067
-Whose truck is it?
-It's my dad's.

14:19.067 --> 14:21.533
-Okay.
-I just got it
from Tennessee actually.

14:21.533 --> 14:23.300
I just went and picked it up
not too long ago.
-Okay.

14:23.300 --> 14:25.600
So you don't live
in Bradenton no more?

14:25.600 --> 14:26.967
-No, I don't.
-Okay.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.367
How long ago was that?

14:28.367 --> 14:31.067
-Uh, not too long ago.
-Okay.

14:31.067 --> 14:33.633
-Justin, do me a favor.
Just step back here
for me, boss.

14:33.633 --> 14:35.167
Just step out
of the car for me.

14:38.267 --> 14:39.633
Okay. Right back here.

14:39.633 --> 14:41.200
Let me ask you this, boss.

14:41.200 --> 14:43.267
When was the last time
you had a little bit
of weed in there?

14:43.267 --> 14:45.233
Is there some
in there right now?
'Cause I'm smelling it.

14:45.233 --> 14:46.867
So, did you have some
maybe earlier?

14:46.867 --> 14:48.833
-Nah. A dude had some earlier.

14:48.833 --> 14:50.967
-Okay, he was smoking
in the truck or something?

14:50.967 --> 14:52.733
-No, he was just smoking
right there at the truck.

14:52.733 --> 14:54.700
-Oh, okay, so maybe
that's why I'm smelling it?

14:54.700 --> 14:56.833
-Yeah, probably.
-All right. I mean,
you can smell it, right?

14:56.833 --> 14:58.233
-Right. Right.
-Okay.

14:58.233 --> 15:00.267
-He just had it.
-Okay. Um...

15:00.267 --> 15:02.733
'cause here's what
I'm gonna tell ya, okay?

15:02.733 --> 15:05.400
I have probable cause
to search you and search
your truck right now.

15:05.400 --> 15:06.667
-Okay.
-Okay?

15:06.667 --> 15:09.200
So, if you wanted
to be honest with me

15:09.200 --> 15:10.600
about anything
that's in there

15:10.600 --> 15:13.567
before I did that,
that would be a good idea
for you.

15:13.567 --> 15:14.767
-Okay.
-Okay?

15:14.767 --> 15:17.100
So 'cause if there's anything
illegal in there,

15:17.100 --> 15:18.500
I'm gonna find it.

15:18.500 --> 15:19.767
-Okay.
-Okay?

15:19.767 --> 15:20.933
So do me a favor.

15:20.933 --> 15:22.867
Just put your hands up
on the tailgate for me.

15:22.867 --> 15:24.567
-On the tailgate?

15:24.567 --> 15:27.533
Okay, well,
can I say no?

15:27.533 --> 15:28.767
-Can you say no to what?

15:28.767 --> 15:30.967
-To a search.
-No.

15:30.967 --> 15:32.300
Here's why.

15:32.300 --> 15:36.233
The smell of marijuana
gives me probable cause

15:36.233 --> 15:38.067
to search in there, okay?

15:38.067 --> 15:39.200
-Okay.
-Okay.

15:39.200 --> 15:42.233
So do me a favor.
Just put your back up against

15:42.233 --> 15:43.467
the front of my car,
okay, boss?

15:43.467 --> 15:45.300
-All right.
-All right?

15:45.300 --> 15:46.967
Yeah, we had a couple
of violations on him.

15:46.967 --> 15:49.300
One being a seatbelt,
one being a stop bar violation.

15:49.300 --> 15:50.567
And then while
I was standing up here,

15:50.567 --> 15:51.900
I could smell
a large amount--

15:51.900 --> 15:53.433
or I could smell
the odor of marijuana.

15:53.433 --> 15:55.167
And it looks like we have...

15:55.167 --> 15:58.567
That's a pretty good
amount of marijuana.

15:58.567 --> 16:01.533
All right, boss,
how much weed is that?

16:01.533 --> 16:05.200
-Two-and-a-half, three.
-How long have you been
selling weed, man?

16:05.200 --> 16:06.700
Just a little bit or what?

16:06.700 --> 16:08.100
-I ain't selling it.

16:08.100 --> 16:09.400
I'm smoking it.

16:09.400 --> 16:12.767
-Come on, man. Look--
-I'm straight up, brother.

16:12.767 --> 16:15.467
I smoke it.
That's all I do, is smoke--

16:15.467 --> 16:17.800
-Nobody carries around
three ounces with 'em
just for smoke.

16:17.800 --> 16:20.767
-I just picked it up.
-Where'd you just
pick it up at?

16:20.767 --> 16:23.800
-Down the road.
From some guys down the road.

16:23.800 --> 16:25.200
-'Cause here's the deal, man.

16:25.200 --> 16:27.767
You know that's enough
to charge with possession
with intent.

16:27.767 --> 16:29.067
-Yeah, and that's
understandable.

16:29.067 --> 16:30.333
-We're dope cops.
That's what we do.

16:30.333 --> 16:34.067
Nobody carries around
three ounces in their truck.

16:34.067 --> 16:36.767
-Nah, like I said,
I just got it so I can smoke it.

16:36.767 --> 16:39.267
I mean... that's all.
That's all I did.

16:39.267 --> 16:40.967
-How much did
you pay for that?

16:43.233 --> 16:45.333
-On the real?
-Yeah, on the real.

16:45.333 --> 16:47.133
-Eight.
-800 bucks?

16:48.200 --> 16:49.900
And you're not
gonna try to flip that?

16:49.900 --> 16:51.400
-No. Honest.
-Come on, man.

16:51.400 --> 16:52.767
-I swear to God
I smoke it.

16:52.767 --> 16:53.967
-You just smoke it?

16:53.967 --> 16:56.200
-That's it.
That's all I do really.

16:56.200 --> 16:58.133
-Why weren't you straight
with me, man?

16:59.533 --> 17:01.300
-'Cause I don't want
to go to jail, man.

17:01.300 --> 17:04.467
I got a good job.
I just been working there,

17:04.467 --> 17:06.067
got a new position.

17:06.067 --> 17:08.067
-All right. So here's the deal.
I'mma search the rest
of the truck.

17:08.067 --> 17:09.733
Am I gonna find
anything else in there?

17:09.733 --> 17:12.500
-Maybe some blunt wraps.
-I don't care about that.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.200
-What's that right there?

17:14.200 --> 17:16.700
-Oh, yeah.
-That's clean pee.

17:16.700 --> 17:19.967
-Hey, boss, who you getting
your clean pee from?

17:19.967 --> 17:22.433
-Clean pee?
-Yeah. Is that what--

17:22.433 --> 17:24.733
Isn't that what's
in that jacket, some clean pee?

17:24.733 --> 17:25.800
-Oh, yeah.

17:25.800 --> 17:27.200
-Yeah? Where are
you getting your clean pee?

17:27.200 --> 17:28.667
-The store.
-The store?

17:28.667 --> 17:30.300
-Yeah.
-You can buy clean pee?

17:30.300 --> 17:32.300
-Yes, sir.
-What's that though?

17:32.300 --> 17:35.067
-It's a heating pad.
-To make the pee warm.

17:35.067 --> 17:36.300
-You got it all
figured out, man.

17:36.300 --> 17:38.067
-What store?
What store can
you buy clean pee?

17:38.067 --> 17:40.267
-Anywhere you want
pretty much. Any head shop.

17:40.267 --> 17:42.100
-Really?
-Yes. Yes, sir.

17:42.100 --> 17:43.833
-What's it called?

17:43.833 --> 17:45.167
-There's different names.

17:45.167 --> 17:46.767
That-- that's called Pee.

17:46.767 --> 17:48.200
-Pee?
-Pee.

17:48.200 --> 17:51.133
-How many times
have you been drug tested
in that pee's worth?

17:51.133 --> 17:52.600
-Twice.
-Really?

17:52.600 --> 17:53.800
How much did that cost you?

17:53.800 --> 17:56.167
-35 cash.
-Sheesh, man!

17:56.167 --> 17:58.500
You got a lot of money
tied up into smoking weed.

17:58.500 --> 18:00.400
Do me a favor.
Turn around,

18:00.400 --> 18:02.600
put your hands behind
your back for me, boss.
-Okay.

18:05.633 --> 18:07.200
-I gotta give you credit, man.

18:07.200 --> 18:09.067
Not too many smokers
think through how

18:09.067 --> 18:10.400
they're gonna pass
their drug test,

18:10.400 --> 18:12.167
especially the heating pad.

18:12.167 --> 18:14.467
-Yeah, you got a little set up.
Weed, you got the pee.

18:14.467 --> 18:16.767
-You're not stupid, man.
You just like weed that much?

18:16.767 --> 18:18.067
You just gotta have it?

18:18.067 --> 18:19.067
-That's all I do.

18:19.067 --> 18:21.733
-Just sit around
and smoke weed?

18:21.733 --> 18:25.067
-All right, boss, we're gonna
put you in the backseat
of this car

18:25.067 --> 18:27.100
and then if
your girlfriend shows up,

18:27.100 --> 18:29.667
um, I'll let her holler at you
before we take you out of here.

18:29.667 --> 18:30.767
-All right.
-All right?

18:30.767 --> 18:32.433
Right back here.

18:32.433 --> 18:34.067
You unlocked?
-Yep.

18:35.367 --> 18:36.700
-Here's the deal, man.

18:36.700 --> 18:38.533
To be honest,
I actually believe you.

18:38.533 --> 18:40.933
I actually believe that
you're gonna smoke all that.

18:40.933 --> 18:42.433
I mean, it's gonna
take you a little while.

18:42.433 --> 18:43.767
How long is that
gonna last you?

18:43.767 --> 18:45.833
-Probably about to
to three weeks.
-Two or three weeks?

18:45.833 --> 18:48.400
All right. So here's the deal.
I'm not gonna hit you with

18:48.400 --> 18:50.400
and intent to sell
charge, okay?

18:50.400 --> 18:52.733
So, you're just gonna
catch a charge, you know,

18:52.733 --> 18:54.500
possession of marijuana
over 20 grams

18:54.500 --> 18:56.533
and then paraphernalia, okay?

18:56.533 --> 18:58.700
So, your bond
will be 2,000 bucks.

18:58.700 --> 19:00.933
Okay? So 200
with a bondsman.

19:00.933 --> 19:02.567
-Okay.
-I think your old lady's here,

19:02.567 --> 19:03.833
so I'll let her
come talk to you.

19:03.833 --> 19:05.067
-Woman on radio:
10-4.

19:06.367 --> 19:08.133
-Are you okay?

19:08.133 --> 19:10.533
-Yeah. Just bail me out.

19:10.533 --> 19:12.500
-Well, I need your--
I need your wallet.

19:12.500 --> 19:13.900
Can you--
-It's all in the truck.

19:13.900 --> 19:15.067
-All right.

19:15.067 --> 19:17.267
-His bond's gonna
be $2,000-- Relax.

19:17.267 --> 19:19.533
His bond's gonna
be $2,000, okay?

19:19.533 --> 19:22.067
-(sobbing)
I got babies, man!

19:22.067 --> 19:23.833
-Look...
-(sobbing)

19:23.833 --> 19:26.133
-Then he need--
-They need their dad!

19:26.133 --> 19:28.667
-Okay, well, then
that's something
he needs to understand.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.400
Justin--
-Just bail me out.

19:30.400 --> 19:31.733
You got the money.

19:31.733 --> 19:33.633
-(sobs)
-This needs to be
a wake up call, right, Justin?

19:33.633 --> 19:36.333
-My phone is up there,
my I.D. is.

19:36.333 --> 19:39.100
Make sure you get
my I.D. in the car.
-Can I give him a kiss, please?

19:39.100 --> 19:40.333
-Yeah, you can
give him a kiss.

19:40.333 --> 19:41.767
Don't do anything silly.

19:41.767 --> 19:43.600
Let this be
a wake up call, man.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.267
It ain't worth it.
Do you agree?

19:45.267 --> 19:46.767
All right. Let her go.

19:46.767 --> 19:48.367
-I love you!
-I love you.

19:48.367 --> 19:49.233
-(car door shuts)

19:50.333 --> 19:52.533
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:52.533 --> 19:54.500
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:54.500 --> 19:55.667
Cover is code three.

19:55.667 --> 19:58.633
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:04.900 --> 20:06.500
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.267
-(theme music playing)
