00:32.466 --> 00:37.766
- MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA -

00:53.966 --> 00:55.966
Sakamoto.

03:40.466 --> 03:44.033
A story like mine should never be told.

03:46.600 --> 03:51.500
For my world is as forbidden as it is fragile.

03:51.900 --> 03:56.066
For without its mysteries it cannot survive.

03:59.666 --> 04:03.133
I certainly wasn't born to the life of a  
Geisha.

04:03.900 --> 04:08.900
Like so much in my strange life-i was carried  
there by the current.

04:14.933 --> 04:18.266
The first time I knew my mother was sick,

04:18.565 --> 04:22.233
..was when my father threw
the fish back into the sea.

04:23.933 --> 04:30.233
That night we went hungry, to understand  
emptiness he told us.

04:33.566 --> 04:38.400
Mother always said that my sister Satsu was  
like wood,

04:38.400 --> 04:44.200
As rooted to the earth as a Sagura tree.
But she told me I was like water,

04:45.300 --> 04:51.100
Water can carve its way, even through stone.

04:51.566 --> 04:56.633
And when trapped, water makes a new path.

05:58.566 --> 06:03.166
These are the girls from Tanaka?
Sisters, yes, from Yurida.

06:05.766 --> 06:10.066
This one maybe, the other one no.

06:29.166 --> 06:34.866
Show your respect for mother.
You must not speak, I will answer for you.

06:35.866 --> 06:39.000
Okai-san

06:44.933 --> 06:49.933
Kneel, and head down, never look her in the  
face.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
How old are you?
She’s year of the rooster.

07:11.833 --> 07:15.100
Only nine...

07:35.733 --> 07:38.533
Where is my sister?

07:38.866 --> 07:42.933
Let me see those eyes.

07:44.966 --> 07:48.133
Look at me.

07:48.533 --> 07:56.366
Too much water. - But mother, a little water 
is good to guard against fire.

07:56.566 --> 08:01.000
You wouldn't have to worry about the okea  
burning, losing all your people, no....

08:01.300 --> 08:06.133
These country girls!
Too late to send her back now.

08:16.300 --> 08:19.333
Go.

08:22.300 --> 08:26.200
Pumpkin, keep her quiet, mother is downstairs

08:28.200 --> 08:31.166
Let me go!

08:31.533 --> 08:35.600
Let me go!
Let me go!

08:36.700 --> 08:42.500
Mother will hear you! She's got a bamboo stick.
I want my sister. Satsu!

08:51.166 --> 08:54.933
I cried too at first.

08:55.966 --> 09:02.066
You know it is easier if you just forget everything 
that happened before you came to the okea.

09:04.066 --> 09:08.500
If you impress mother, and do exactly as she  
says,

09:08.733 --> 09:11.600
She will send you to school to be a Geisha.

09:12.733 --> 09:17.433
A what?
A Geisha, like Hatsumomo.

09:17.800 --> 09:21.766
You will get to drink sake, and sleep until  
noon.

09:22.800 --> 09:27.633
Where is my sister??
Probably in another okea in Hanonoke.

09:31.000 --> 09:37.433
Your family sold you to this house, you live  
here now.

09:52.433 --> 09:57.133
Outside you wear these, inside these.

09:59.366 --> 10:04.666
We don't display our naked feet like monkeys.

10:05.666 --> 10:08.500
It's not flesh we're selling here,

10:08.500 --> 10:10.866
This is a Geisha house.

10:13.600 --> 10:22.800
Remember to always honour this okea.
You listen, you learn, now get to work.

10:24.800 --> 10:27.900
Be Quiet. Hatsumomo is sleeping

10:32.000 --> 10:34.766
Pumpkin, when can I go outside?

10:34.766 --> 10:38.000
Outside the okea?  You can't.

10:38.066 --> 10:39.166
It’s not allowed.

10:39.166 --> 10:41.466
How will I find Satsu?

10:42.766 --> 10:45.333
You can't just walk out to every house in  
Hanamachi. 

10:47.000 --> 10:48.466
Do you know how many there are?

10:51.700 --> 10:52.900
Look

11:23.300 --> 11:24.866
Tighter!

11:50.666 --> 11:52.700
Chiyo, Chiyo-chan

11:53.566 --> 11:55.100
come...

11:55.100 --> 11:56.300
Two nights ago..

11:56.500 --> 11:59.600
..Hatsumomo had to stay at the  
Tea-house until dawn,

11:59.600 --> 12:01.433
Thats what she told madam.

12:01.700 --> 12:05.700
But she was really here with a man, the whole...
Why can't you be quiet?!

12:11.700 --> 12:15.500
So, this is the new arrival.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.400
A pity she still stinks of fish.

12:48.800 --> 12:50.366
Stay out of my room.

12:52.000 --> 12:57.400
Your fingers smell..
 I can't have you touching my things!

13:12.366 --> 13:17.300
Only reason mother tolerates Hatsumomo is  
because she brings in good money.

13:18.000 --> 13:23.733
Never forget it is Hatsumomo who pays for your  
supper,

13:24.000 --> 13:25.500
the clothes on your back.

13:26.800 --> 13:29.000
 By the time she was twenty...

13:29.000 --> 13:33.200
....she had already earned 
back her purchase price.

13:35.500 --> 13:40.000
She has been the talk 
of the Hanamachi ever since.

13:40.566 --> 13:46.866
These are all hers?
Certainly not, they belong to the okea.

13:52.466 --> 13:55.000
A Geisha needs an elegant wardrobe..

13:55.000 --> 13:58.700
...just like an artist needs ink.

13:58.700 --> 14:03.033
If she's not properly dressed..
then she is not a true Geisha.

14:04.366 --> 14:09.000
Nobody told me what a Geisha is...
You will find out soon enough.

14:09.533 --> 14:16.333
I have news for you child, mother has  
determined that it is off to school with you.

14:17.433 --> 14:21.633
You are to become Geisha!

14:24.666 --> 14:27.966
Chiyo, Pumpkin!

14:30.033 --> 14:35.433
Quick quick, don't be late.. 
and you will be late.

14:44.100 --> 14:46.766
This way.

15:02.933 --> 15:05.500
Pumpkin, Pumpkin...

15:06.300 --> 15:09.100
I'm going to run, I'm going to find Satsu.

15:09.100 --> 15:11.000
Not yet you don't.

15:13.433 --> 15:16.000
You will ruin your own chances, and mine too

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Please...Stay with me..

15:19.933 --> 15:26.533
Wait there! Squid!

15:47.266 --> 15:49.733
Look for your sister's name later!

16:05.600 --> 16:07.233
You are late!

16:34.033 --> 16:36.833
Chiyo, where is granny's food?

16:39.266 --> 16:43.233
Where have you been?
It’s freezing cold!.

16:46.233 --> 16:48.366
Close the window.
Hai! (yes).

17:06.000 --> 17:08.300
Chiyo, Chiyo, come quickly.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.866
Hatsumomo is at the bath-house..here tidy up.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.366
But she told me to stay out...

17:15.366 --> 17:18.800
Hatsumomo does not run this okea.

17:34.433 --> 17:36.900
Why look who's in my room...

17:55.966 --> 17:57.600
Did you touch this?

18:04.400 --> 18:07.300
I can just hear the General now..

18:07.300 --> 18:12.000
"..Why Hatsumomo, you used to smell of jasmine,..

18:12.133 --> 18:16.733
"..What’s this new perfume?
Blowfish?.."

18:17.500 --> 18:22.100
I told you to never to touch my things.
Can’t you understand why?

18:25.000 --> 18:29.900
Because your general will say,
"Hatsumomo, you stink!"

18:34.133 --> 18:37.166
At least you don't smell
 as bad as your sister

18:38.166 --> 18:40.400
you know,....she was here...

18:40.400 --> 18:43.666
She came by looking for you.
Chiyo: What?

18:45.666 --> 18:47.900
Was I wrong to ask her to leave?

18:48.066 --> 18:51.233
Please, tell me where she is.

18:55.466 --> 18:58.900
Only if you swear yourself to me first.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.566
yes? Huh?

19:06.566 --> 19:08.100
Now get out!

19:29.333 --> 19:32.766
Shh...Hatsumomo you'll 
wake the entire house.

19:33.766 --> 19:36.866
Your big sister is thirsty, so am I,

19:36.866 --> 19:38.300
go and get us some beer.

19:39.433 --> 19:41.300
I'm not in the mood for beer.

19:41.300 --> 19:44.433
I know what you're in the mood for..

19:44.433 --> 19:46.100
And his name is Koichi

19:49.100 --> 19:51.466
What did you say Korin?

19:52.466 --> 19:55.000
 Im Sorry.. I forgot

20:01.533 --> 20:04.533
You're just jealous someone cares for me!

20:07.900 --> 20:09.933
Guess who this belongs to?

20:10.400 --> 20:13.266
 A Geisha as desired as she is..

20:13.266 --> 20:16.266
ought to keep a closer eye on her clothes.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.466
It’s Mameha's?!
Yes!

20:20.500 --> 20:22.966
How did you get it?
Bribed her maid.

20:33.266 --> 20:37.900
We can't....Give it to her.

20:39.866 --> 20:42.900
Chiyo, come, come.

20:45.733 --> 20:50.466
Now then little Chiyo, it is time..
 to practice your calligraphy.

20:59.333 --> 21:01.533
There.

21:07.166 --> 21:13.433
Remember, you swore yourself to me.
Yes.

21:40.100 --> 21:43.366
Don't let anybody see you.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.366
Go, go!

21:53.200 --> 21:55.700
This will teach the great Mameha.

22:21.466 --> 22:24.533
Thieving rat!.

22:25.500 --> 22:29.500
That kimono was worth more than you.

22:29.500 --> 22:32.466
Careful, you will hurt 
yourself more than her.

22:32.900 --> 22:35.866
Let me.

22:49.600 --> 22:55.733
Kneel.
What have you done to Hatsumomo?

22:55.733 --> 22:58.333
I haven't done anything, I promise you.

22:58.333 --> 23:02.000
Her little trick with than kimono will cost  you.

23:02.233 --> 23:07.033
Whatever you have done to anger her,
you'd be wise to stop, now!

23:07.766 --> 23:12.533
Lie down.
I will beat you hard, 

23:12.933 --> 23:16.000
so mother doesn't beat you harder.

23:46.666 --> 23:49.766
I told you not to let anybody see you.

23:51.300 --> 23:56.866
I have kept my promise, 
so tell me, where is she?

23:59.800 --> 24:03.233
She is the next Hanamachi...

24:03.233 --> 24:07.733
in a house called Tatsuyo,
in the pleasure district.

24:09.366 --> 24:13.300
Trust me little Chiyo, you will find her.

26:07.233 --> 26:11.233
Satsu, Satsu, Satsu...

26:11.233 --> 26:13.233
Satsu, open the door..Satsu!..

26:13.233 --> 26:19.233
Satsu, Satsu, no! Satsu! Satsu!

26:51.233 --> 26:54.266
Satsu, Satsu!
Chiyo!!

26:57.366 --> 27:00.200
What took you so long?
But Satsu, I tried...

27:02.733 --> 27:06.233
I went to your okea weeks ago, they laughed  
and turned me away.

27:06.633 --> 27:10.700
Please, I did not know
I’ve missed you so much.

27:13.800 --> 27:16.800
Let’s leave, tonight.
But we need money too.

27:17.900 --> 27:21.300
I know I can steal some, first thing tomorrow...
No, please, tonight!

27:21.700 --> 27:27.500
No, tomorrow, meet me at the Saturn-May  
bridge, as soon as it's dark.

27:30.066 --> 27:32.166
Now you have to go.... quickly.

27:32.166 --> 27:33.500
Before somene catches

27:33.500 --> 27:35.866
What if I cannot get away?

27:35.866 --> 27:38.100
Be there Chiyo, its our one chance, 

27:38.100 --> 27:40.200
once I’ve left I can't go back.

27:40.200 --> 27:43.466
 I’ve waited as long as I can, now go.

28:33.533 --> 28:35.000
What is she doing here?
What?

28:35.000 --> 28:37.566
She’s seen us!
Stupid girl.

28:39.266 --> 28:40.866
Stupid girl, why have you come back?

28:40.866 --> 28:45.200
You’re probably trying to escape!
Get in.

28:48.633 --> 28:49.400
Get in! Koichi please!

28:49.400 --> 28:51.800
Look at us, 
we're sneaking around like criminals!

28:53.233 --> 28:56.000
Koichi don't!
It's degrading!

28:56.333 --> 29:00.266
What's going on?
Koichi...

29:00.866 --> 29:02.466
Who's there?

29:04.600 --> 29:07.200
Go now.. Go..

29:16.000 --> 29:17.833
Show your face!

29:22.600 --> 29:24.666
Okai-san, I caught her stealing

29:24.666 --> 29:29.100
..she was running away 
with her sister the whore!

29:30.433 --> 29:33.900
You little thief!
No, she's lying.

29:35.100 --> 29:37.000
After all we've done for her!

29:37.300 --> 29:40.266
I saw her with a man, right there!
His name is Koichi!

29:41.933 --> 29:45.166
Shut up!
We should kick her out.

29:47.566 --> 29:50.633
Take her arms.

30:10.966 --> 30:14.666
You are never to see him again, huh?

30:18.200 --> 30:22.266
What do you think? 
A Geisha is free to love?

30:22.266 --> 30:22.800
Never!.

30:24.800 --> 30:31.766
Bolt the gate, no one is leaving this okea!

33:55.166 --> 33:58.566
Doctor Ohura is very expensive.

33:59.966 --> 34:04.200
You seem to be racking up
quite a debt, huh?

34:06.333 --> 34:10.699
Kimono destroyed, Geisha school...

34:10.699 --> 34:15.966
..rice and pickles, train ticket,
Mr. Bekku,.. all this...

34:16.000 --> 34:19.100
...on top of the money I paid Mr. Tanaka?

34:20.533 --> 34:23.966
Then for what?

34:23.966 --> 34:27.666
And now I hear that your
sister has run away.

34:28.466 --> 34:33.699
She didn't wait for you and 
now she can never come back.

34:34.699 --> 34:38.366
You must forget you
ever had a sister, huh?

34:47.000 --> 34:49.900
We are your only family now.

35:20.666 --> 35:23.400
"Dear Satsu and little Chiyo,

35:23.400 --> 35:28.000
as one who was once an  
orphan child myself,

35:28.000 --> 35:31.566
this humble person is sorry
to inform you that six weeks

35:31.566 --> 35:34.933
after you left for your new life in Myoko...

35:34.933 --> 35:39.466
...the suffering of your
honoured mother came to it's end ...

35:40.466 --> 35:43.400
..And only a few weeks afterwards..

35:43.400 --> 35:47.333
..your honoured father
departed this world as well...

35:47.400 --> 35:51.966
..this humble person feels confident
that both your honoured parents..

35:51.966 --> 35:54.766
 ..have found their places in paradise."

35:55.166 --> 36:00.266
At the temple there is a poem called loss 

36:00.266 --> 36:03.200
carved into the stone.

36:03.233 --> 36:08.300
It has three words, but the poet
has scratched them out.

36:10.100 --> 36:14.600
You cannot read loss, only feel it.

36:16.466 --> 36:20.166
My father and mother had left this life,

36:20.166 --> 36:25.066
my sister I never heard of again.

36:25.733 --> 36:30.533
I had dishonoured the okea
so mother had other plans for me.

36:31.766 --> 36:35.966
I would pay back my debt,
year after year after year.

36:37.233 --> 36:41.433
Not as a Geisha, as her slave.

36:55.566 --> 36:58.200
It is too pretty a day 
to be so unhappy.

37:01.233 --> 37:02.066
Did you fall down?

37:06.200 --> 37:10.000
Why so shy?
Nothing to be ashamed of.

37:10.300 --> 37:13.633
We all stumble from time to time.

37:14.300 --> 37:17.433
You see that enchanting lady in green?

37:17.433 --> 37:19.633
Once, when she was just a Miko 
(an apprentice Geisha)

37:19.633 --> 37:23.133
she fell clean off her wooden shoes.

37:23.633 --> 37:25.733
It's true, I did. 

37:25.733 --> 37:27.833
And now look at her, so elegant!

37:27.833 --> 37:30.300
Mr. Chairman, shouldn't we hurry? 

37:30.300 --> 37:33.466
We will miss the beginning.
We see the Spring dances every year.

37:33.466 --> 37:35.033
We can spare a moment.

37:37.366 --> 37:39.066
What's your name?

37:41.066 --> 37:43.766
Don't be afraid to look at me.

37:51.033 --> 37:57.633
Do you like sweet plum or cherry?
You mean to eat?

37:57.866 --> 38:00.900
I like sweet plum myself.

38:04.000 --> 38:08.633
None of us find much kindness in this life, as 
we should.

38:10.100 --> 38:13.100
Hi, both kinds please.

38:14.933 --> 38:18.733
My children wait for these every Spring.

38:34.766 --> 38:39.933
Now I am a Geisha too.
So you are.

38:40.633 --> 38:43.166
How did you come by such surprising eyes?

38:45.533 --> 38:50.333
My mother gave them to me.
Generous of her wasn't it?

38:50.566 --> 38:54.833
As you have been to me.

38:56.033 --> 38:58.700
Smile for me won't you?

38:58.900 --> 39:01.866
There now, that is your gift to me.

39:07.866 --> 39:11.733
This will buy your supper.
Now promise me onething,

39:12.100 --> 39:16.900
Next time you take a tumble, 
no frowns.

39:17.600 --> 39:22.100
That's better.

39:30.500 --> 39:35.900
In that moment I changed from a girl,
facing nothing but emptiness...

39:36.200 --> 39:39.100
...to someone with purpose. 

39:39.100 --> 39:44.033
I saw that to be a Geisha 
could be a stepping stone...

39:44.033 --> 39:49.133
...to something else..
A place in "His" world.

40:17.166 --> 40:19.900
The money the chairman had given me,

40:19.900 --> 40:23.500
could have bought fish
and rice for a month,

40:23.500 --> 40:30.866
But I gave it back in prayer, 
keeping only his handkerchief.

40:35.166 --> 40:38.466
I asked one day to become a Geisha,

40:38.466 --> 40:45.066
and then somehow,
to meet him again.

41:28.066 --> 41:32.000
Chiyo-chan? I can't find my coat,
did you find it yet?

41:36.366 --> 41:42.766
I couldn't sleep last night
I was so worried about my stupid hair.

41:43.066 --> 41:47.400
Am I lopsided?
You look beautiful.

41:47.700 --> 41:52.166
With your hair like that you look 
more like a pumpkin than ever.

41:52.966 --> 41:55.766
Don't fold your neck forward like a tortoise.

41:56.133 --> 41:59.533
She's not ready? We will be late.

41:59.533 --> 42:03.333
Poor pumpkin, her debut and 
everybody will be staring at you.

42:06.533 --> 42:11.466
Hurry up, huh?. 
This time, do your "Shamsin" before you play,

42:11.466 --> 42:15.800
when you make a fool of yourself
your big sister gets the blame

42:15.833 --> 42:19.233
Stop crying, your face will run.

42:19.833 --> 42:22.333
Pumpkin!

44:29.966 --> 44:35.866
The winter I turned fifteen,
I saw the chairman again,

44:36.266 --> 44:40.666
But that wasn't the only surprise fate 
brought me that season.

44:41.166 --> 44:45.766
Along with the snow came a most unexpected  visitor.

44:53.366 --> 44:56.266
Why is she here?

44:56.900 --> 45:00.600
Chiyo, Chiyo, open the gate!

45:26.533 --> 45:31.033
Now that your beloved granny has gone
you have no need for a maid.

45:31.333 --> 45:34.900
I would never question 
the great Mameha,

45:34.900 --> 45:40.866
but you could choose
anyone in the Hanamachi.

45:40.866 --> 45:42.233
You flatter me, truly.

45:43.166 --> 45:45.033
I would give you my pumpkin

45:45.033 --> 45:48.066
 if she weren't 
already tied to Hatsumomo.

45:48.466 --> 45:50.766
Please I would never dream of asking.

45:50.766 --> 45:55.866
Besides, I can always
sell Chiyo to Mrs. Tetsuyo

45:56.800 --> 45:59.800
With your eye for beauty
and nose for talent,

45:59.800 --> 46:03.633
surely you can see what a
terrible waste that would be.

46:03.633 --> 46:07.366
If you were not the kind hearted Geisha

46:07.366 --> 46:10.266
 I know you to be, then

46:10.266 --> 46:14.600
I might think that you were
scheming against Hatsumomo.

46:16.366 --> 46:18.400
Then I'm grateful Mrs. Nita 

46:18.400 --> 46:22.000
that you don't 
have a suspicious mind.

46:22.033 --> 46:24.833
Perhaps you can pique my interest with..
Yes?

46:24.833 --> 46:28.500
..your offer.

46:28.500 --> 46:33.066
I will cover Chiyo's schooling,
all her expenses, 

46:33.066 --> 46:36.233
until after her debut.

46:36.233 --> 46:40.866
Now I am confident
that you are teasing.

46:40.866 --> 46:42.900
I could not be more sincere.

46:42.900 --> 46:47.000
If Chiyo has not repaid her debt
within six months after her debut.

46:47.000 --> 46:52.566
Impossible, too little time!
Then I will pay you twice over.

46:52.600 --> 46:54.566
What...?

46:56.366 --> 46:59.300
No Geisha could ever...

46:59.300 --> 47:04.033
I am certain you will not
object to one trivial condition

47:04.833 --> 47:06.133
Uh yes...?

47:06.133 --> 47:11.200
If Chiyo erases her debt
in the time allowed,

47:11.200 --> 47:15.200
You will not have any part
in her future earnings.

47:17.000 --> 47:21.066
It's too good to be true,
Mameha is up to something.

47:21.066 --> 47:25.833
She isn't in it for the money,
that much is for certain.

47:25.833 --> 47:26.500
Rumour has it, 

47:26.500 --> 47:29.300
ever since the Prime Minister bought her 
Misuage(virginity)

47:29.300 --> 47:30.600
she's been rich

47:31.000 --> 47:32.800
It is Absurd? 

47:32.800 --> 47:35.866
Absurd, to think that
she noticed Chiyo.

47:35.866 --> 47:40.600
It's that kimono, she remembers
how you destroyed it,

47:41.000 --> 47:43.166
now she wants to get even.

47:43.166 --> 47:47.833
An odd picture isn't it? 
Hatsumomo sweeping into tea-house

47:47.833 --> 47:50.733
after tea-house with our little Pumpkin, 

47:50.733 --> 47:53.733
and the Mameha with our maid.

47:54.466 --> 47:57.933
I'm so far behind,
I will never catch up to you.

47:57.933 --> 48:00.466
Don’t worry, I will help you.
Pumpkin!

48:07.333 --> 48:13.533
You are never to speak to
her again, now you  are rivals!

48:34.933 --> 48:39.000
This is how it was, 
this tiny world of women,

48:39.733 --> 48:41.866
friend turned against friend.

48:41.866 --> 48:47.033
And now the two greatest Geisha
in Myoko at war over me.

48:47.533 --> 48:51.400
Hatsumomo at my back, 
Mameha calling,

48:52.033 --> 48:54.233
offering me the chance 
to become one of those

48:54.233 --> 48:58.333
elegant women I had seen on the bridge,

48:58.633 --> 49:04.500
floating in a silk kimono, 
the chairman at my side.

49:05.766 --> 49:12.600
Chiyo is my new protoge
as lovely as her big sister,

49:13.333 --> 49:17.600
And with eyes the colour of rain.

49:19.100 --> 49:21.333
The baron is a very special man to me,

49:21.333 --> 49:26.800
my "Daninia", someday if you are 
fortunate, you will have a patron too.

49:30.000 --> 49:35.000
Don't kneel, you are not
a servant girl anymore.

49:40.300 --> 49:42.000
Step into the light.

49:47.466 --> 49:51.333
I see water in you.
Does that displease you?

49:51.566 --> 49:52.933
Water is powerful.

49:52.933 --> 49:57.233
It can wash away earth, put out fire,
and even destroy iron.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.933
But you have not drawn on those strengths have you?

50:00.933 --> 50:02.933
About your kimono....

50:04.733 --> 50:07.000
You may apologise if you wish.

50:07.866 --> 50:12.066
Why that is a perfect bow,
for a pig farmer...

50:13.366 --> 50:14.666
Don't drop your head,

50:14.666 --> 50:20.266
..fingertips together, elbows in,
no weight on the hands. 

50:20.300 --> 50:21.000
Yes.

50:22.500 --> 50:25.266
As for the kimono, I’m no fool Chiyo.

50:25.600 --> 50:28.633
Hatsumomo cannot tolerate competition.

50:28.633 --> 50:31.266
She is jealous of you.

50:31.500 --> 50:36.866
Not me I'm afraid,
someone closer to home.

50:37.866 --> 50:43.500
Rise. Not like a horse.

50:47.633 --> 50:49.766
Slide your foot forward.

50:51.100 --> 50:56.666
That's it. Now walk. 
You are a magnificent Geisha.

50:58.633 --> 51:03.466
Tell me Chiyo, does Mrs. Nita
ever speak of the future?

51:03.866 --> 51:05.566
Not to me.

51:05.566 --> 51:08.233
Well someday soon
she will have to name an heir.

51:08.233 --> 51:10.300
One of her own Geisha to succeed her.

51:10.533 --> 51:14.166
Strange isn't it that
she has not adopted Hatsumomo.

51:14.166 --> 51:18.033
That would be like releasing
a tiger from it's cage.

51:18.266 --> 51:20.066
You have a gift for expression.

51:20.066 --> 51:26.800
And if Mrs. Nita adopts Pumpkin
that is hardly a threat...

51:27.000 --> 51:29.933
...but a young girl with eyes like rain...

51:29.933 --> 51:33.000
But Mrs. Nita would never choose me.

51:33.000 --> 51:37.600
On the contrary, that is our goal
It is?

51:37.966 --> 51:40.800
Of course. If you do not inherit the okea,

51:40.800 --> 51:43.466
then we will all be at the tiger's mercy.

51:48.566 --> 51:53.466
Water is always in such a hurry, 
perhaps that is just as well.

51:53.666 --> 51:56.533
We have no time to lose.

52:00.333 --> 52:02.733
We must transform you.

52:02.733 --> 52:07.266
And what takes years 
you must learn in months. 

52:14.566 --> 52:16.300
Say I’m entertaining the baron,

52:16.300 --> 52:20.166
like so many clients he's
trapped in an arranged marriage,

52:20.433 --> 52:24.733
So in the tea-house when
he's seeking my company instead,

52:24.766 --> 52:28.766
I reward him like this 
with a glimpse of my wrist.

52:29.166 --> 52:33.200
Seeing this demure little trace of naked skin.

52:33.200 --> 52:35.966
Well,...it gives him pleasure.

52:37.966 --> 52:42.033
Or when you're sitting down,
for the briefest moment..

52:42.033 --> 52:44.333
..press your leg against his,

52:44.400 --> 52:47.500
Always by accident of course.

53:03.966 --> 53:06.933
Mameha, when does a Geisha choose her donor?

53:07.133 --> 53:09.700
I'm afraid it's the other way around, 

53:09.700 --> 53:13.566
focus on your studies Chiyo,
music, the art of conversation,

53:14.766 --> 53:20.866
That's the surest way to attract a
donor on your feet, not off them!

53:55.500 --> 54:01.733
Remember Chiyo, Geisha are
not courtesans, and we're not wives.

54:02.566 --> 54:05.566
We sell our skills, not our bodies.

54:07.633 --> 54:12.433
We create another secret world, 
a place only of beauty.

54:13.633 --> 54:18.733
The very word Geisha means
artist, and to be a Geisha ...

54:18.733 --> 54:21.800
..is to be judged as a moving
work of art

55:30.366 --> 55:33.366
Agony and beauty, for us, live side by side.

55:34.566 --> 55:39.166
Your feet will suffer, your fingers will bleed.

55:39.466 --> 55:42.600
Even sitting and sleeping will be painful.

55:52.066 --> 55:54.366
You cannot call yourself a true Geisha 

55:54.366 --> 55:58.500
until you can stop a man
in his tracks with a single look.

55:59.033 --> 56:02.500
No one can do that.
Choose someone for me.

56:04.833 --> 56:07.233
The grey hat...

56:30.266 --> 56:35.566
Choose someone for me sister.
The boy on the bike, with one look.

56:56.200 --> 56:58.400
You are ready.

57:39.666 --> 57:45.733
Hurry up, you're not making money
standing there gawking at yourself.

57:47.466 --> 57:49.166
For luck.

58:11.933 --> 58:14.466
This binds us together forever as sisters.

58:15.466 --> 58:18.900
Today you leave your childhood
and cast away your name.

58:19.333 --> 58:24.733
From this day forward you
will be known as Sayuri.

58:30.366 --> 58:32.966
When Mameha granted me my new name...

58:32.966 --> 58:39.433
...I felt little Chiyo disappear
behind a white mask with red lips.

58:39.766 --> 58:45.166
I was a miko now, an apprentice Geisha.

58:45.566 --> 58:48.833
From that moment I told myself 

58:48.833 --> 58:56.166
when I make tea, whenI pour sake,
when I dance, when I tie my kimono...

58:56.700 --> 59:02.233
...it will be for the chairman, until he finds me...

59:02.600 --> 59:05.300
...until I am his.

59:18.666 --> 59:21.700
Ready?
Onay-san..

59:23.666 --> 59:25.433
Thank you.

59:30.733 --> 59:34.966
Friends, we have the
pleasure to witness the debut

59:34.966 --> 59:38.333
of a new Miko, 
Cheers!

59:51.666 --> 59:56.066
I remember those eyes
what was her name?

59:57.566 --> 01:00:00.000
Sayuri.

01:00:18.766 --> 01:00:20.333
Determined isn't she?

01:00:20.333 --> 01:00:22.066
If there had been a drop of tea in that pot...

01:00:22.066 --> 01:00:24.366
..I believe, Sayuri would have gotten it out.

01:00:25.066 --> 01:00:29.066
I told you Mr. Baron, it is her very first time.

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:32.066
What a beautiful dance, yes Pumpkin?

01:01:33.166 --> 01:01:39.533
Her fans are so hypnotic, that you
may not even notice her feet!

01:01:40.633 --> 01:01:44.900
What's her name?
Her name is Sayuri.

01:01:45.033 --> 01:01:46.400
Sayuri...

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:48.566
A name as sweet as she is.

01:01:48.566 --> 01:01:52.800
I'm afraid that these days
even a common chambermaid...

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:55.166
...can call herself a Geisha.

01:01:55.166 --> 01:02:01.033
So it's nice to see such a
sincere young apprentice, isn't it?

01:02:01.166 --> 01:02:06.766
Why yes. - Surely you would like to thank 
Hatsumomo for her gracious compliment.

01:02:07.966 --> 01:02:11.566
There is so much I would
like to say to Hatsumomo.

01:02:12.166 --> 01:02:16.066
Sometimes the smartest remark is silence.

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:21.600
What better advice to follow than your own?
Sayuri!

01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:25.000
I was a miko myself once. 
Of course!

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.433
but it's been such a very long,

01:02:28.433 --> 01:02:33.733
long, long...long, long, time.

01:02:43.333 --> 01:02:46.300
I shall destroy you.

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:53.400
She can destroy you.
She would spread rumours.

01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:56.500
Stalk you from tea-house to tea-house,
then steal your clients,

01:02:56.500 --> 01:03:00.166
all in the hope that Mrs. Nita
adopts Pumpkin instead of you.

01:03:00.166 --> 01:03:02.666
What can we do?
We've got to outwit her,

01:03:02.666 --> 01:03:04.700
to find a place somewhere beyond her reach,

01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:08.266
where you can practice your skills
without any interference.

01:03:08.666 --> 01:03:11.166
Your first sumo match.
What?

01:03:11.466 --> 01:03:13.866
Today you will meet (Chairman) Iwamura.

01:03:13.866 --> 01:03:17.466
He is head of the Iwamura
electric company in Osaka.

01:03:17.466 --> 01:03:19.366
My client for years.

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:25.266
We will entertain him and his partner Nobu.
You may find Nobu quite a challenge.

01:03:25.266 --> 01:03:29.866
He does not like Geisha.

01:03:37.166 --> 01:03:39.666
Be attentive, I will do the rest.

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:49.966
Chairman Iwamura, President Nobu, 
this is my new younger sister Sayuri.

01:03:53.466 --> 01:04:02.566
Nobu-san? - Nobu-toshi-kashi-san
Injured in Manchuria, war hero.

01:04:02.566 --> 01:04:04.966
Sayuri, is this your first sumo match?

01:04:06.766 --> 01:04:10.766
Nobu-san will have to educate you, 
I cannot tell one wrestler from the next.

01:04:10.766 --> 01:04:15.133
That is the Chairman's diplomatic
way of saying he hates sumo.

01:04:20.566 --> 01:04:22.366
Did you notice our contribution,

01:04:22.366 --> 01:04:26.000
we are harnessing the power 
of water to bring electricity

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.766
to some of the smaller villages.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
It was in the newspaper wasn't it?

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.833
Ah, the Chairman's picture, yes.
You compensate for all my shortcomings don't you?

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.466
May I ask, 
How does someone harness the power of water?

01:04:40.466 --> 01:04:44.366
You should never ask an engineer to 
explain a thing because he will!

01:04:44.366 --> 01:04:47.800
Let the girl watch sumo.

01:04:56.633 --> 01:05:02.133
Hatsumomo, that snake!
Quick, turn your attention to Nobu.

01:05:02.133 --> 01:05:05.366
but Mameha-san...
-Hatsumomo finds him repulsive,

01:05:05.366 --> 01:05:06.866
she would never steal him away.

01:05:06.866 --> 01:05:09.133
Mislead her, go.

01:05:26.966 --> 01:05:31.666
Perhaps Nobu-san would be kind enough 
to explain the rules of the match.

01:05:34.866 --> 01:05:39.600
Three things matter in life...
...sumo, business, and war,

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:43.466
Understand one, you know them all.
But why should a Geisha care?

01:05:43.866 --> 01:05:46.366
You spend your time plucking
strings and dancing.

01:05:48.933 --> 01:05:51.966
I humbly beg to differ.

01:05:51.966 --> 01:05:54.866
What is sumo but a dance between giants?

01:05:54.866 --> 01:05:57.766
What is business but a dance between companies?

01:05:57.766 --> 01:06:01.600
I'd like to know about every kind of dance.

01:06:05.833 --> 01:06:08.533
They are throwing salt to purify the ring.

01:06:18.933 --> 01:06:23.833
That man is Miyagi-Ammar,
the greatest fighter in Japan.

01:06:23.833 --> 01:06:28.766
But he's so tiny!
Only compared to his opponent.

01:06:30.466 --> 01:06:34.366
Miyagi may use...

01:06:34.466 --> 01:06:38.933
Are you listening?
Yes.

01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:48.966
Hataki-comi is a movement a smaller opponent
uses to throw a larger opponent off balance.

01:06:48.966 --> 01:06:51.800
Victory does not always belong to the powerful!

01:06:52.966 --> 01:06:56.766
Look, there, in his eyes!

01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:03.133
I'm afraid our time has come to a close.
Going so soon?

01:07:03.133 --> 01:07:06.833
Not yet!
I want her to see.

01:07:25.533 --> 01:07:29.600
Now that is Hataki-comi!
I see now why you like sumo.

01:07:29.633 --> 01:07:34.533
You can never judge a man's power 
by his appearance alone.

01:07:38.766 --> 01:07:42.966
Mameha!
You may bring her again.

01:08:01.233 --> 01:08:04.833
I scoured the newspaper for
the Chairman's photograph.

01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:09.100
Anything to preserve our moment together.

01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:16.300
A moment, stolen, when I was forced
to turn my attention to Nobu.

01:08:17.433 --> 01:08:21.500
In that instant I felt the world shift...

01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:26.933
But not my own determination
I made a secret promise.

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:34.899
Along with his picture, I would lock away 
my heart, and save it for him.

01:08:41.566 --> 01:08:43.600
Mameha-san.
Come here.

01:08:45.866 --> 01:08:49.666
Tonight we will deliver a quick blow to 
Hatsumomo - Hataki-comi.

01:08:49.966 --> 01:08:50.765
How?

01:08:50.765 --> 01:08:53.800
We will meet Nobu-san
at the Sunashima restaurant.

01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:58.332
But first a visit to Dr. Crab.
Dr. Crab?

01:08:58.332 --> 01:09:00.633
It's a little nickname he's earned over the years.

01:09:00.633 --> 01:09:02.666
Mameha-san! - Hold still!

01:09:04.566 --> 01:09:07.066
I have something in mind, a plan.

01:09:09.033 --> 01:09:10.332
Now cut your leg where I've marked it.

01:09:10.332 --> 01:09:13.233
What?!
Or I will do it for you.

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:17.733
Have you gone mad?
Do you trust me or don't you?

01:09:19.366 --> 01:09:21.033
Well?

01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:31.765
Go ahead, do it!.

01:09:41.033 --> 01:09:43.466
Careless with the sowing scissors were you?

01:09:43.765 --> 01:09:47.300
Right through your beautiful
kimono. Such a pity.

01:09:47.366 --> 01:09:52.265
It won't leave a scar will it? 
Sayuri is a special girl...

01:09:52.265 --> 01:09:55.366
...at a very special time in her life.

01:09:57.366 --> 01:10:04.366
Yes, with those eyes,
You must be quite a commodity.

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:16.366
Clean cut, won't leave a mark, I promise.

01:10:16.566 --> 01:10:21.366
But I had best prescribe a bit of antiseptic.

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:41.300
Your honourable sister says,"Cut your leg",
You cut your leg.

01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:47.733
She says follow me? You follow her.
My life had turned into a game...

01:10:48.333 --> 01:10:52.500
...and only she knew the rules.

01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:57.800
At the right moment slip it to Nobu - discreetly.

01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:02.633
He will know what it means.

01:11:08.466 --> 01:11:11.466
You have kept us waiting.
Please forgive us Nobu-san.

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:17.433
The Chairman thinks I should
take more pleasure in life,

01:11:17.433 --> 01:11:20.766
like music and the theatre.
What is your impression?

01:11:22.466 --> 01:11:26.633
It is useless to push your cart sideways,

01:11:27.633 --> 01:11:31.466
 one could not wish, Nobu-san,
to be anyone other than Nobu-san.

01:11:31.866 --> 01:11:35.733
I could not agree more.
I owe this man everything.

01:11:35.733 --> 01:11:38.466
He gives me too much credit as usual.

01:11:38.833 --> 01:11:41.900
Probably, cheers!
Cheers!

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:53.833
It is a trinket, I found it a few days ago...

01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:59.133
Nobu-san, I had no idea you were so sentimental.

01:11:59.133 --> 01:12:01.833
Call it my "new leaf."

01:12:05.366 --> 01:12:10.433
My mother...my mother,
she used to wear something similar.

01:12:13.133 --> 01:12:15.400
You do not like it?

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:23.566
Forgive me, I've never received a present before.

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:29.133
What a beautiful comb.

01:12:31.133 --> 01:12:34.133
Such a joyous moment Sayuri.

01:12:34.366 --> 01:12:40.100
You're finally getting what you deserve.
How lovely.

01:12:40.866 --> 01:12:44.500
And now will you excuse us please,

01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:52.866
we have another engagement, many in fact.
Pumpkin?

01:13:06.866 --> 01:13:08.566
You are most kind.

01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:25.000
Now give this one to Dr. Crab.
Mameha please...

01:13:25.366 --> 01:13:28.500
You're upset?
I want to trust you I do...

01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:30.000
...but you have to tell me what's going on.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:34.900
I am ensuring your future.
But tell me how, I beg you.

01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:38.000
I am trying to orchestrate a bidding war.
What for?

01:13:38.466 --> 01:13:41.033
Your most precious attribute.
And what is that?

01:13:41.033 --> 01:13:43.066
Your misuage (virginity).

01:13:43.566 --> 01:13:47.066
Did mother ever tell you
about the eel in the cave?

01:13:47.333 --> 01:13:54.100
Well, every once in a while, 
a man's eel likes to visit a woman's cave.

01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:57.133
Yes I know.
You do?

01:13:57.133 --> 01:13:58.733
I live with Hatsumomo.

01:13:59.133 --> 01:14:05.133
Well, your cave is untouched...men like that.
We call this misuage (virginity).

01:14:05.433 --> 01:14:08.866
And to become a full Geisha
we must sell this to the highest bidder.

01:14:08.866 --> 01:14:10.533
Did you sell yours?

01:14:10.966 --> 01:14:14.133
The largest sum ever paid - ten thousand yen.

01:14:14.233 --> 01:14:18.633
I freed myself from debt, and so will you.

01:14:19.666 --> 01:14:25.766
When you slip the rice-cake to Dr. Crab
its the sign your Misuage is ripe for sale.

01:14:28.666 --> 01:14:33.266
The doctor has no desire to see
you tonight...or any night.

01:14:39.066 --> 01:14:42.333
Pumpkin! Hatsumomo went
to see Dr. Crab, yes?

01:14:43.066 --> 01:14:44.866
I have to go Chiyo-chan

01:14:45.566 --> 01:14:47.566
Didn't she?
I do not know.

01:14:47.866 --> 01:14:50.366
Of course you know!
You shadow her every step.

01:14:50.366 --> 01:14:54.566
You expect me to betray my big sister.
Has she made you cruel as well?

01:14:54.566 --> 01:14:57.533
No.
My Pumpkin always told the truth.

01:15:01.533 --> 01:15:03.000
The truth...

01:15:09.366 --> 01:15:12.333
Tonight, we went to the tea-house
to see Dr. Crab.

01:15:12.333 --> 01:15:15.166
I sat outside but I could still
hear through the screen...

01:15:15.166 --> 01:15:19.466
...and Hatsumomo then said to him
"I live in the same Okea as Sayuri.."

01:15:19.466 --> 01:15:22.200
"..and did you know that she
brings men back to her room?"

01:15:22.233 --> 01:15:26.300
"No" he said,
"they come in, sailors, and fishermen too."

01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:29.333
And the doctor looked queazy
like he didnt want to hear anymore.

01:15:29.666 --> 01:15:33.766
But she kept going. And Hatsumomo said to him
"What's the matter?"

01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:35.866
"have I told you more than you wanted to know?"

01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:41.566
I'm so sorry, I wanted to say something...

01:15:41.566 --> 01:15:44.800
...but how could I Chiyo-chan? 
...how?

01:15:46.566 --> 01:15:47.866
Am I really like her?

01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:51.666
Am I?
Of course not.

01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:59.400
Is Mameha-san cruel to you too?
No, she's so kind to me...

01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:04.566
...but sometimes I worry she's taken me
further from the things I want.

01:16:07.117 --> 01:16:08.547
That man Nobu...

01:16:10.717 --> 01:16:13.817
...Do you really like him?
No.

01:16:14.317 --> 01:16:16.377
That's what I thought.

01:16:17.517 --> 01:16:20.687
Do you like somebody else?

01:16:29.097 --> 01:16:34.787
Don't worry about me Chiyo-chan.
I'll be fine. Better than fine.

01:16:34.837 --> 01:16:39.637
Mother plans to adopt me, so my
dream of having some place to

01:16:39.637 --> 01:16:41.327
 live out my life may come true.

01:16:42.747 --> 01:16:43.657
I have to go.

01:16:53.127 --> 01:16:55.157
We could still win Sayuri.
How?

01:16:55.937 --> 01:16:58.227
Hatsumomo has poisoned Dr. Crab against me.

01:16:58.937 --> 01:17:02.467
Forget about him,
there are plenty of other fish in the sea.

01:17:02.877 --> 01:17:04.727
The Chairman has been kind...
Sayuri!

01:17:04.727 --> 01:17:06.967
Nobu and the Chairman are business partners,

01:17:07.317 --> 01:17:12.807
they would never bid against one another.
It is time we cast a wider net.

01:17:13.917 --> 01:17:15.587
Suppose there was a night in Myoko.

01:17:15.587 --> 01:17:19.987
Hundreds of men all in one place,
eager to bid for you.

01:17:20.397 --> 01:17:21.177
What do you mean?

01:17:21.177 --> 01:17:24.127
Where you are the object
of all their fantasies.

01:17:24.497 --> 01:17:29.407
The most famous Geisha in the Hanamachi. 
But I'm not. - You will be...

01:17:39.817 --> 01:17:44.107
Who is responsible for this?
Ask Mameha.

01:17:44.107 --> 01:17:48.627
I'm asking you Oka-san.
How come Sayuri gets to be the lead?

01:17:49.027 --> 01:17:52.127
It's your own fault.
You should practice more.

01:17:56.137 --> 01:17:57.767
What did Mameha do?

01:18:00.167 --> 01:18:03.007
Speak to the director in private?

01:18:04.617 --> 01:18:07.777
Not every Geisha uses that kind of currency.

01:18:11.827 --> 01:18:14.777
I'm looking forward
to your performance.

01:18:14.777 --> 01:18:21.397
You know how I adore watching you
dance...Chiyo.

01:18:54.217 --> 01:18:55.637
They all have come..

01:18:56.437 --> 01:19:00.187
the Baron, Nobu-san,
our beloved Hatsumomo,

01:19:00.187 --> 01:19:02.777
and that dapper General of hers..

01:19:03.187 --> 01:19:08.677
Anybody else?
And even your old friend, Dr. Crab.

01:19:20.437 --> 01:19:26.207
Mameha-san, what if I dance poorly, 
what if I disgrace myself,

01:19:26.407 --> 01:19:31.317
and no one takes interest?
You will be glorious.

01:19:45.037 --> 01:19:47.627
Now, it's time.

01:22:59.237 --> 01:23:05.617
Sayuri, you remember the Doctor.
I hope my performance pleased you Doctor.

01:23:05.817 --> 01:23:11.067
Aah, you danced with such profound fury.
I most humbly thank you.

01:23:11.077 --> 01:23:14.187
It seems you've once again
caught the Doctor's interest.

01:23:14.387 --> 01:23:18.497
And I am most grateful.
If you have heard any gossip...

01:23:18.497 --> 01:23:22.227
Ah yes?
Then I hope you will follow your own advice.

01:23:22.797 --> 01:23:30.097
And what would that be, pray tell?
Seek a second opinion.

01:23:39.817 --> 01:23:41.147
Ah Chairman.

01:23:41.747 --> 01:23:44.817
Sayuri gave such a passionate performance, 
don't you think?

01:23:45.417 --> 01:23:50.337
Indeed. - Mameha, did you invite the 
Chairman to my estate this weekend?

01:23:50.427 --> 01:23:54.957
It's my annual blossom viewing party.
Baron, I told you I cannot go.

01:23:55.167 --> 01:23:59.127
I have an urgent appointment.
Taking care of a little nuisance,

01:23:59.467 --> 01:24:05.907
or was that a naughty secret?
Baron, wouldn't Sayuri look stunning...

01:24:05.907 --> 01:24:10.637
among the flowers on your estate?
Yes, very pretty.

01:24:10.717 --> 01:24:14.577
Be sure to send her along.
With a chaparone of course,

01:24:14.577 --> 01:24:18.177
I'm certain Mr. Bekku will oblige.

01:24:18.817 --> 01:24:22.917
That's a fine idea Baron, but
Sayuri is required at the theatre.

01:24:22.997 --> 01:24:29.197
Mameha, I expect her there.
Nobu, coming Saturday?

01:24:29.307 --> 01:24:33.937
All that way to see a cherry tree?
I will leave that to the Chairman.

01:24:34.947 --> 01:24:37.617
[You were] wonderful tonight.
Excuse me.

01:24:41.917 --> 01:24:47.287
If you would rather not go.
I'd like to go very much.

01:24:48.867 --> 01:24:51.347
Then be on your guard, every moment.

01:24:51.347 --> 01:24:54.327
There is a reason Hatsumomo
wants you there.

01:24:54.837 --> 01:24:57.737
Trust me, I know my Baron, Sayuri.

01:24:58.037 --> 01:24:59.937
He has a weakness for beautiful women.

01:25:00.937 --> 01:25:06.107
And now, you are the most
celebrated Geisha in all Myoko.

01:25:07.107 --> 01:25:10.517
The most desired as well.

01:25:49.737 --> 01:25:53.937
Sayuri, today, even the cherry blossoms 
are envious of her.

01:26:03.117 --> 01:26:06.107
There's something I've been wanting
to say to you for some time now.

01:26:08.107 --> 01:26:14.387
 I'd like to...
to thank you for your attention to Nobu-san.

01:26:15.597 --> 01:26:17.297
Nobu can be a difficult man.

01:26:17.307 --> 01:26:22.307
So you see dear, at parties,
sake only in moderation.

01:26:22.317 --> 01:26:24.107
And he disdains Geisha.

01:26:25.647 --> 01:26:27.107
But he...

01:26:27.117 --> 01:26:29.717
...he’s fond of you.

01:26:31.017 --> 01:26:34.217
Because you admire him,
I respect him more.

01:26:34.427 --> 01:26:39.727
He would never tell you himself.
He's far too modest.

01:26:40.057 --> 01:26:44.517
We were fighting in Manchuria together,
there was an explosion.

01:26:44.537 --> 01:26:51.737
He protected me from the worst of it.
As you might imagine, I owe him quite a debt.

01:26:52.647 --> 01:26:56.937
Nobu has taught me a great deal,
patience, for one thing.

01:26:56.937 --> 01:27:00.277
I, in turn, have tried to teach him.

01:27:00.687 --> 01:27:03.077
You have to savour life while you can.

01:27:03.177 --> 01:27:06.177
The legend of the cherry blossom.

01:27:06.177 --> 01:27:11.487
That is why Nobu likes you.
We must not expect happiness Sayuri,

01:27:11.737 --> 01:27:16.907
it is not something we deserve.
When life goes well, it's a sudden gift,

01:27:16.907 --> 01:27:19.437
it cannot last forever.

01:27:26.617 --> 01:27:32.317
Ah Sayuri, there you are.
I have a present for you.

01:27:39.937 --> 01:27:42.567
Mameha asked me to show you
my kimono collection.

01:27:43.677 --> 01:27:47.857
It's quite venerated,
my grandfather and father,

01:27:47.857 --> 01:27:49.237
..collected kimono before me.

01:27:50.647 --> 01:27:54.087
I've given a number of
valuable kimono to Mameha.

01:27:54.087 --> 01:27:56.787
I like to give presents to beautiful girls.

01:28:00.587 --> 01:28:02.377
It's for you.

01:28:06.837 --> 01:28:09.797
Come, have a closer look.

01:28:14.907 --> 01:28:16.737
Isn't it lovely?

01:28:19.747 --> 01:28:26.247
Try it on.
The Baron is too kind.

01:28:26.727 --> 01:28:31.667
I will happily try it on, with Mameha, 
when the Baron returns to Myoko.

01:28:31.857 --> 01:28:33.417
Who knows when that would be?

01:28:34.027 --> 01:28:36.207
Put it on now, don't be shy.

01:28:42.207 --> 01:28:44.017
Don't worry..

01:28:44.317 --> 01:28:48.487
I have experience in knotting kimonos, 
and untying them as well.

01:28:50.247 --> 01:28:53.147
Please, Mr. Bekku is waiting.

01:28:54.127 --> 01:28:57.377
Mr. Bekku is waiting for no one.

01:28:58.377 --> 01:29:03.617
Please...stop!

01:29:11.337 --> 01:29:14.147
Please stop now!

01:29:38.947 --> 01:29:42.617
Sayuri, I only want to have a look.

01:29:43.817 --> 01:29:49.187
No harm in that.
Any man would do the same.

01:31:01.177 --> 01:31:03.367
I heard a message on the wind.

01:31:03.907 --> 01:31:08.317
So careless!
You have ruined all our plans!

01:31:08.317 --> 01:31:09.437
I did nothing.

01:31:09.437 --> 01:31:13.557
Sayuri, do not insult me.
I know the Baron better than that..

01:31:13.557 --> 01:31:16.387
He gave me a kimono.
You sold yourself for a kimono!

01:31:16.787 --> 01:31:18.367
I did not sell myself.

01:31:18.367 --> 01:31:21.167
Today is the day I accept bids for your
<I>misuage</I>.

01:31:21.167 --> 01:31:25.207
But what kind of price can I hope to demand
with a finger pointed at your back?

01:31:25.207 --> 01:31:30.237
He looked at me that's all Onay-san.
You will be examined at the misuage ceremony.

01:31:30.237 --> 01:31:33.717
If you are found to be worthless...
I am not worthless!

01:31:36.817 --> 01:31:39.807
I am not worthless.

01:31:52.667 --> 01:31:55.777
How much longer is this bidding going to take?

01:31:55.777 --> 01:32:02.337
Besides, who wants a plum when someone
has already had a bite?

01:32:19.597 --> 01:32:23.697
What is it?
Twenty yen, thirty?

01:32:24.407 --> 01:32:30.517
This can't be the right amount.
I trust you agree, I have won the wager.

01:32:32.647 --> 01:32:36.817
Sayuri's made history, 
no misuage has ever been sold for more.

01:32:37.217 --> 01:32:42.027
Not even mine.
Fifteen thousand yen.

01:32:41.957 --> 01:32:47.057
Unbelievable.
<I>Arigato Gudaimas Onay-san</I>

01:32:47.237 --> 01:32:52.227
Of course none of it will go to
Sayuri, or to you Mameha.

01:32:52.237 --> 01:32:58.837
It goes to this okea.
All fifteen thousand yen. To this estate.

01:32:59.177 --> 01:33:00.967
I do not understand.

01:33:00.967 --> 01:33:05.707
That, Sayuri, you will inherit
as my adopted daughter.

01:33:07.427 --> 01:33:09.847
What?
You wouldn't dare!

01:33:09.847 --> 01:33:13.027
I'm entitled to do as I choose.

01:33:13.297 --> 01:33:15.587
But you promised the okea to Pumpkin!

01:33:17.637 --> 01:33:24.127
Look at her, still a virgin Miko.
Pumpkin!

01:33:24.127 --> 01:33:27.097
Can't you adopt us both?
Quiet Sayuri.

01:33:27.517 --> 01:33:32.567
Now I'm no fool.
Pumpkin would only be Hatsumomo's puppet.

01:33:33.567 --> 01:33:37.957
How long will it take before you 
kick us out onto the street?

01:33:38.357 --> 01:33:45.847
I have given you my life.
Yes, and your impudence, your wild temper.

01:33:49.677 --> 01:33:52.437
Who paid for that kimono on your back,

01:33:52.647 --> 01:33:56.937
The rice in your bowl
The tobacco in that paper of yours? Who?

01:33:56.947 --> 01:34:01.177
Don't exaggerate!
You have never even had a patron.

01:34:01.817 --> 01:34:06.517
Don't say it, don't say it!
You chose that no good Koichi.

01:34:06.817 --> 01:34:12.527
Peeking through your window
at all hours of the night. - Quiet!

01:34:12.527 --> 01:34:16.337
Not like a Geisha, like a common prostitute.

01:34:19.447 --> 01:34:32.117
Besides, you are getting old.
But Sayuri, Sayuri's destined to become a legend.

01:34:46.817 --> 01:34:58.147
My dear Oka-san.
We will see. Won't we?

01:35:03.227 --> 01:35:08.687
Sayuri, your room is too small.
Take Hatsumomo's.

01:35:11.737 --> 01:35:16.797
From now on, your name is Nita Sayuri..

01:35:17.407 --> 01:35:21.347
May I congratulate you both.
You may.

01:35:27.857 --> 01:35:34.117
Onay-san.. Everything we wanted
you made happen. Thank you.

01:35:37.337 --> 01:35:41.167
May I ask who?
Dr. Crab.

01:35:42.577 --> 01:35:44.627
Was Nobu disappointed?

01:35:44.637 --> 01:35:48.037
Nobu did not bid.
It was against his mighty principles.

01:35:51.447 --> 01:35:59.257
Dr. Crab was opposed by the Baron, my Baron.
Do you want to know the truth Sayuri?

01:36:00.227 --> 01:36:06.097
He was the highest bidder.
Forgive me, but I let it go to Dr. Crab..

01:36:06.307 --> 01:36:11.237
I think you understand why.
I swear to you, I am innocent.

01:36:11.707 --> 01:36:16.947
Of course you are. No man would ever bid so 
much for a thing he had already taken.

01:36:17.547 --> 01:36:22.147
It was my own fault.
I did not protect you.

01:36:28.627 --> 01:36:36.627
Celebrate this moment Sayuri.
Tonight, the lights in the Hanamachi all burn for you..

01:38:16.057 --> 01:38:18.427
My daughter...

01:38:28.437 --> 01:38:30.547
You are a full geisha now.

01:38:54.567 --> 01:38:56.427
What are you doing in my room?

01:39:01.507 --> 01:39:04.117
I came to congratulate you.

01:39:06.617 --> 01:39:08.287
Please get out.

01:39:10.817 --> 01:39:20.167
Why little Chiyo, look what I've found.
His initials, how elegant.

01:39:20.167 --> 01:39:23.167
You have been hiding your
love for a long time.

01:39:24.937 --> 01:39:29.937
The sacrifice every Geisha must make.
Don't!

01:39:51.077 --> 01:39:53.947
Is this where you keep it?
Next to your heart?

01:40:05.387 --> 01:40:06.877
 Give it back.

01:40:14.097 --> 01:40:15.817
 Give it BACK!

01:40:26.817 --> 01:40:28.817
MOTHER!!

01:41:55.187 --> 01:42:00.817
I could be her.
Now I am Geisha to this house.

01:42:04.697 --> 01:42:13.227
I could be her. Were we so different?
She loved once. She hoped once.

01:42:15.207 --> 01:42:23.817
I might be looking into my own future.
Until the real future came falling from the air.

01:43:36.367 --> 01:43:37.817
Stop.

01:43:51.087 --> 01:43:55.887
Korin, have you see Sayuri?
No...I don't know.

01:44:07.117 --> 01:44:11.407
Chairman! They are sending us away
but they won't say where.

01:44:11.417 --> 01:44:15.337
Osaka, but you must not go.
The city is a prime target.

01:44:15.337 --> 01:44:17.817
Get your things, quickly.

01:44:20.157 --> 01:44:23.717
Nobu and I are trying to find safe
havens for as many of you as we can.

01:44:23.717 --> 01:44:24.807
Come.

01:44:30.167 --> 01:44:34.587
Here, work certificates, nurse's aid.

01:44:34.587 --> 01:44:36.937
A friend of mine is the
chief surgeon in Kamioka.

01:44:36.977 --> 01:44:39.967
What about Sayuri?
Can't we go together? - NO.

01:44:39.967 --> 01:44:43.197
Don't worry, she will be taken care of...so..

01:44:47.197 --> 01:44:48.817
Here we go...

01:44:49.317 --> 01:44:51.117
Sayuri!
Onay-san

01:44:52.167 --> 01:44:58.657
Sayuri come.
This is Alima, he will take you into the hills.

01:44:59.007 --> 01:45:01.997
Nobu has got a friend there,
a kimono maker.

01:45:03.007 --> 01:45:09.317
Anyone stops you, show them this.
 Do I have to go?

01:45:09.347 --> 01:45:11.817
It's remote, you will be safe.

01:45:14.317 --> 01:45:17.617
What about you?
You said Osaka was dangerous..

01:45:17.627 --> 01:45:21.747
Our factory is there, I have no choice.

01:45:26.837 --> 01:45:32.567
 Go, I will express your
gratitude to Nobu-san.

01:45:53.817 --> 01:46:04.717
A year without news, except news of death.
Defeat. Shame. Rumours of cities...

01:46:04.717 --> 01:46:13.517
...evaporating into clouds of smoke.
Then another year, and then another.

01:46:14.457 --> 01:46:16.927
Until the old life is a dream-life.

01:46:18.737 --> 01:46:21.137
Was I ever a Geisha?

01:46:22.047 --> 01:46:26.227
Did I ever dance, holding a fan?

01:46:26.227 --> 01:46:32.067
Who would hold a fan now...
or paint their lips?

01:46:34.747 --> 01:46:41.587
And then another year.
Nothing. Rice...work.

01:46:41.587 --> 01:46:47.637
Rice...work. Nothing.

01:46:55.457 --> 01:47:02.707
Sayuri. Sayuri, a man from Osaka
has come to see you.

01:47:27.817 --> 01:47:29.817
Nobu-san

01:47:36.817 --> 01:47:40.667
General Tottori was captured
and tried as a war criminal..

01:47:41.067 --> 01:47:45.927
The Baron lost his fortune
and committed suicide.

01:47:46.927 --> 01:47:48.927
What about the okea?

01:47:48.927 --> 01:47:52.467
Mr. Bekku has gone, but the others...
Auntie and mother?

01:47:53.677 --> 01:47:56.707
Indestructible as always.

01:47:58.317 --> 01:48:03.917
And the chairman?
As well as can be expected.

01:48:07.727 --> 01:48:10.647
This is all that remains of our factories.

01:48:13.867 --> 01:48:16.817
I'm so sorry Nobu-san.

01:48:18.817 --> 01:48:20.807
Sayuri...

01:48:25.147 --> 01:48:30.287
We want to rebuild, but to do that 
we will need your help.

01:48:30.557 --> 01:48:41.757
What can I do?
Somewhere, under those rags,

01:48:35.337 --> 01:48:39.197
are you still the greatest Geisha in Myoko.

01:48:44.477 --> 01:48:48.567
If a tree has no leaves or branches,
can you still call that a tree?

01:48:50.017 --> 01:48:55.387
With nothing but rubble at my feet,
can I  still call myself a businessman?

01:49:06.367 --> 01:49:11.767
I should have taken better care of you.
Please, you saved my life.

01:49:12.937 --> 01:49:14.767
I owe you so much in return.

01:49:18.347 --> 01:49:20.647
The chairman and I need
American financing.

01:49:21.247 --> 01:49:24.477
There is a man,
a certain Colonel Derricks

01:49:24.477 --> 01:49:27.157
who has the power to
grant us a contract.

01:49:27.597 --> 01:49:33.257
I showed him your picture. 
He asked to meet you.

01:49:39.567 --> 01:49:45.267
I am not a persuasive man Sayuri,
but if you, and a few Geisha,

01:49:45.717 --> 01:49:48.477
would once again put on your 
kimono and join us,

01:49:48.887 --> 01:49:54.287
we can show the Americans 
how hospitable our country can be.

01:49:54.627 --> 01:50:00.817
How I wish Nobu-san.
But that was a long time ago.

01:50:01.117 --> 01:50:06.927
I have no doubt Sayuri, that you could still 
melt the heart of any man....

01:50:07.607 --> 01:50:09.907
...no matter how resistant.

01:50:13.817 --> 01:50:15.617
I am not accustomed to begging,

01:50:18.517 --> 01:50:19.717
but please know that...

01:50:20.417 --> 01:50:26.357
...if you consent, the Chairman and 
I would be most grateful.

01:51:03.107 --> 01:51:04.657
The Chairman needed me.

01:51:05.667 --> 01:51:09.607
But I was a far cry from the
Geisha I had once been.

01:51:11.647 --> 01:51:16.747
The secrets of our hidden world were
postcards now for girls back home.

01:51:16.757 --> 01:51:21.247
Any street-walker with a painted 
face and silk kimono...

01:51:21.267 --> 01:51:23.247
..could call herself a geisha.

01:51:26.637 --> 01:51:31.767
I looked for the one person
who might help....Mameha.

01:51:31.937 --> 01:51:34.607
The war was written on her face.

01:51:35.607 --> 01:51:36.787
Everything about her,

01:51:36.787 --> 01:51:39.837
not just her home, was less than before.

01:51:41.787 --> 01:51:45.557
Sayuri, when my poor Baron filled
his pockets with stones,

01:51:45.557 --> 01:51:47.557
I was desperate.

01:51:47.657 --> 01:51:54.257
What could I do? I sold my kimono.
I traded my jade cones for rations.

01:51:55.167 --> 01:51:58.967
It was painful at first, 
but I have made my peace.

01:51:59.007 --> 01:52:02.837
Now, I make a small but tidy 
living renting rooms.

01:52:03.047 --> 01:52:07.657
I am not about to go chasing the past.
It might do you good.

01:52:08.657 --> 01:52:11.607
How?

01:52:11.617 --> 01:52:13.907
To remind you that
once with a single glance,

01:52:13.907 --> 01:52:17.517
you could bring a man
like the Baron, to his knees.

01:52:26.137 --> 01:52:30.737
Well, I did keep one kimono.

01:52:40.737 --> 01:52:43.737
The Baron gave it to me when 
he became my patron.

01:52:51.297 --> 01:52:54.397
Thank you Onay-san.

01:52:57.077 --> 01:52:58.707
So tell me...

01:52:59.507 --> 01:53:03.707
...What do we know about
entertaining Americans?

01:53:41.457 --> 01:53:44.947
Chiyo-chan, is that you?

01:53:56.337 --> 01:53:59.507
I have no right to ask favours of you, Pumpkin

01:53:59.507 --> 01:54:00.977
I know that.
Guess what?

01:54:00.977 --> 01:54:02.747
I only smoke Chesterfield's now.

01:54:02.957 --> 01:54:05.757
I've wanted to apologise
to you for so long..

01:54:05.757 --> 01:54:07.987
about the okea.
These Soldier boys...

01:54:07.987 --> 01:54:09.317
You know who, they've got me singing..

01:54:09.317 --> 01:54:12.857
It should've gone to you, not me
Frank Sinatra and Dana Short

01:54:12.857 --> 01:54:14.827
Is it so hard to forgive me?

01:54:14.827 --> 01:54:18.927
Sayuri don't.

01:54:21.237 --> 01:54:22.597
The honest truth?

01:54:24.077 --> 01:54:27.937
I'd rather chew sand than
go back to all that.

01:54:28.847 --> 01:54:30.547
Then you are not angry with me?

01:54:34.387 --> 01:54:41.057
Don't worry about me chica-dee..
I've got more clients than I can handle.

01:54:42.867 --> 01:54:45.477
You see so at-home with these Americans.

01:54:46.707 --> 01:54:48.467
They're bastards!

01:54:50.577 --> 01:54:52.667
So, who's this colonel?

01:54:52.817 --> 01:54:54.477
Sounds like top-brass.

01:54:55.477 --> 01:55:00.417
He has the power to approve American
funding for Nobu and the Chairman.

01:55:00.657 --> 01:55:06.747
So, is he willing to pay us American dollars?
Cash?

01:55:09.537 --> 01:55:13.667
Don't waste my time. 
Do you think I'm a sucker?

01:55:14.137 --> 01:55:20.837
I want sixty cases of Lucky Strike or I'm 
taking my business to Sgt. McFee.

01:55:22.547 --> 01:55:25.987
I had to become a Geisha once more.

01:55:26.457 --> 01:55:31.477
Mother had reopened the okea, but my 
powder-box was empty.

01:55:31.857 --> 01:55:34.257
My charcoal had turned to dust.

01:55:35.797 --> 01:55:39.957
And yet, it was my one chance to
see the Chairman again.

01:55:40.567 --> 01:55:45.517
Would he notice my weathered hands?
The threadbare silk?

01:55:45.517 --> 01:55:48.667
See...you are yourself again.

39:44.100 --> 39:48.860
The world had changed completely.
Had he?

39:49.700 --> 39:56.160
And would I finally find the strength to tell 
him all that I felt?

40:20.640 --> 40:25.230
Just look at you Sayuri, it's as if the war 
did not happen.

40:27.040 --> 40:30.380
I'm so glad to see that the Chairman's safe.
Please accept my apologies asking this of you.

40:31.850 --> 40:35.480
No, there's nothing I can't do to 
return your kindness.

40:37.890 --> 40:39.880
I've wanted to tell you that...
Sayuri!

40:45.270 --> 40:48.360
May I present Colonel Derricks.
Konichiwa.

40:51.910 --> 40:53.470
My god, you're more stunning in person.

40:53.780 --> 40:56.370
This is my associate Lt. Hutchins.

40:58.250 --> 41:01.310
Sayuri is one of the mysteries of the orient I 
told you about.

41:01.620 --> 41:04.450
A mystery that perhaps you can solve.
Would you mind? Can we?

41:05.120 --> 41:06.650
Yes, of course.
Colonel?

41:13.770 --> 41:15.030
Beautiful.

41:15.740 --> 41:20.330
Hey, who likes whisky?

41:20.440 --> 41:25.540
Chairman, don't tell me you've started the 
party without me. - May I present Pumpkin?

41:34.560 --> 41:36.390
Gentlemen.

42:37.870 --> 42:40.110
Back home a bath is nothin'
more than a quick shower

42:40.110 --> 42:42.020
and a cold towel with a lotta soap. Right?

42:42.680 --> 42:45.540
But here you make
everything a ritual don't you?

42:45.540 --> 42:49.470
That is the art of turning
habit into pleasure Colonel.

42:49.980 --> 42:51.400
Spoken like a true Geisha.

42:51.400 --> 42:55.860
If we are in business together, 
then perhaps we will visit you some day.

42:55.860 --> 42:58.360
I'd like to see the United States

42:58.860 --> 43:00.990
I know a little game we can play..

43:00.990 --> 43:04.230
it's called truth and lies.

43:04.740 --> 43:08.040
I know this game,
back home we call it marriage.

43:13.380 --> 43:14.350
Now listens closely,

43:14.880 --> 43:18.080
Sayuri knows the rules.

43:18.950 --> 43:22.950
Each person says two things. 
One is true, the other is not.

43:23.290 --> 43:26.160
If you guess right, the liar pays the price.

43:28.160 --> 43:31.890
So it pays to lose?
There you go.

43:33.200 --> 43:34.800
Ok I go first.

43:37.070 --> 43:42.170
One day in Sapporo, where I was born, a
fisherman caught a Token-fish...

43:43.280 --> 43:47.010
This story is the true one, 
and I haven't even heard it yet.

43:51.390 --> 43:55.790
If I drown, it's all your fault.

43:56.800 --> 44:00.790
Please, I am no match for these Geisha, 
they are expert in the art of deceit.

44:01.300 --> 44:05.800
I'm an expert in one thing,
and one thing only, Sake.

44:07.140 --> 44:09.610
Sayuri, the truest story you know.

44:11.520 --> 44:17.800
Once, when I was a little girl,
on the banks of the Sunagawa,

44:17.800 --> 44:24.250
a handsome stranger was kind enough
to buy me a cup of sweet ice.

44:24.250 --> 44:26.030
Sayuri, I think we have to stop the game...

44:26.040 --> 44:28.930
...if Pumpkin drinks any more Sake, 
she will pass out.

44:39.650 --> 44:45.960
So, what is the protocol?
Excuse me?

44:45.960 --> 44:49.560
Suppose I wanted to see you in private...

44:49.760 --> 44:53.290
I beg your pardon Colonel, 
that is not a Geisha's custom.

44:57.640 --> 44:59.330
If it's a question of price?

44:59.340 --> 45:02.500
If there were a price,
you could never afford it.

45:07.010 --> 45:08.630
I saw the two of you whispering.

45:08.630 --> 45:11.240
You have arranged some kind of twist,
haven't you?

45:11.240 --> 45:12.220
What did you promise him?

45:13.000 --> 45:17.000
Your company, nothing more.
He seemed to expect a great deal.

45:17.000 --> 45:20.300
If I wanted a common whore, I could have hired one.

45:20.300 --> 45:25.470
What are you trying to say?.
Just the idea of you with him, with any man,

45:26.470 --> 45:28.540
you would be dead to me.

45:39.250 --> 45:41.650
Can't you see that I want you for myself?

45:43.860 --> 45:49.770
You have ruined me.
Before we met I was a disciplined man.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.030
I shouldnt have asked you to come

45:54.030 --> 45:58.610
The chairman was against it
I should have listened to him.

46:10.740 --> 46:13.400
I must beg your forgiveness Nobu-san.

46:13.760 --> 46:16.720
I was foolish to think you
would barter me away.

46:17.470 --> 46:20.230
Then you made no arrangement
with the Colonel?

46:20.230 --> 46:22.440
Please, don't insult me again.

46:24.640 --> 46:30.140
If he ratifies our contract, 
then I will be a man of means again.

46:30.350 --> 46:38.850
There is nothing I want more Sayuri, 
than to become your patron.

46:42.060 --> 46:45.190
I already owe you far too much.
I will not be refused.

46:45.190 --> 46:49.160
Please don't...- We are tied to each other.
I know you feel it too.

46:50.070 --> 46:51.560
I never meant to mislead you.

46:55.110 --> 46:57.000
Sayuri...

46:58.410 --> 47:05.410
I do not like things held out before me,
that I cannot have.

47:08.960 --> 47:12.630
When you first introduced me to Nobu, 
I was such a fool to give him my attention.

47:12.630 --> 47:15.980
You cannot refuse him, you must not.
But Mameha...

47:15.980 --> 47:20.370
What is he to think? He safeguarded your life!
So he owns it?!

47:21.540 --> 47:25.000
Sayuri, I know what it is like to try to 
scrape by without a patron.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.290
I would do something, anything else

47:27.290 --> 47:31.970
Scrounging for every meal?
Is this the life that you want?

47:31.970 --> 47:34.200
I want a life that is mine!

47:34.200 --> 47:37.790
Nobu has never treated 
you with anything but kindness.

47:38.360 --> 47:42.960
I don't want mere kindness.
What? What more can we expect?

47:43.270 --> 47:44.560
We're Geisha.

47:46.370 --> 47:48.360
You had feelings for the
Baron didn't you?

47:51.080 --> 47:54.910
I never allowed myself that.
Don't lie to me.

47:56.020 --> 47:59.640
In time, you learn.
I dont want to learn

47:59.640 --> 48:00.900
Sayuri!

48:02.620 --> 48:05.060
We don't become Geisha 
to pursue our own destinies.

48:05.360 --> 48:09.330
We become Geisha because we have no choice.

48:28.590 --> 48:31.450
Pumpkin!
What is it, what's wrong?

48:31.760 --> 48:35.390
Nothing. I have a favour to ask, that's all.
Ask.

48:36.560 --> 48:41.270
At nine o'clock, bring Nobu to the pool, 
on the far side of the garden.

48:41.300 --> 48:44.280
Not a minute before,
not a minute after. Yes?

48:45.280 --> 48:50.510
And please, do not tell Nobu
that I will be there waiting.

48:50.510 --> 48:53.980
It's a surprise?
Yes. It's a surprise.

50:43.920 --> 50:47.780
Chairman?
Chairman!

50:57.240 --> 51:01.830
How could you?
You don't know what you have done.

51:01.840 --> 51:07.340
But I do.
I do not understand.

51:07.580 --> 51:14.380
Why did you have to bring the Chairman?
Because I know how you feel about him.

51:16.350 --> 51:24.760
A long time ago, you took something from me.
The only thing I ever truly wanted.

51:25.600 --> 51:31.160
Well...now you know how it feels.

53:05.450 --> 53:13.090
The heart dies, a slow death, 
shedding each hope like leaves...

53:14.660 --> 53:22.560
...until one day there are none.
No hopes. Nothing remains.

53:25.810 --> 53:32.110
She paints her face to hide her face.
Her eyes like deep water.

53:34.590 --> 53:40.720
It is not for Geisha to want. 
It is not for Geisha to feel.

53:43.300 --> 53:46.890
Geisha is an artist of the floating world.

53:47.300 --> 53:54.090
She dances. She sings. She entertains you

53:55.090 --> 54:03.810
..whatever you want. 
The rest is shadows. The rest is secret.

54:13.570 --> 54:17.810
Sayuri, quick quick,
the tea-house just called.

54:17.810 --> 54:22.340
You are to meet a very
important client tonight.

54:22.480 --> 54:25.670
Who?
It must be Nobu.

54:25.880 --> 54:33.850
Yes, he's going to be one
of the richest men in Osaka.

54:35.460 --> 54:42.490
He'll want to honour his promise, 
to become your patron at last.

54:47.570 --> 54:55.300
It's about time, finally.
A return on my investment.

54:56.320 --> 55:01.000
Giko, maybe, one day,
you will bel as lucky.

55:03.000 --> 55:06.360
No Geisha can ever hope for more.

56:21.290 --> 56:25.680
Chairman!
Where is Nobu-san?

56:26.260 --> 56:28.780
He won't be coming.
Is something wrong?

56:29.560 --> 56:33.260
He knows what happened.
It is not in his nature to forgive.

56:36.400 --> 56:40.400
Chairman, what happened on the island...

56:40.670 --> 56:45.510
Please, you do not have to explain.
But I have shamed myself so deeply...

56:47.420 --> 56:55.350
...past all forgiveness.
No, I am the one who must be forgiven.

56:55.960 --> 57:04.130
I do not understand.
Perhaps if you had only known the truth.

57:06.840 --> 57:09.240
The truth?

57:11.780 --> 57:12.850
Some years ago..

57:13.850 --> 57:20.850
 I was on my way to the theatre,
I saw a little girl weeping by the Sunagawa,

57:21.260 --> 57:28.360
I stopped to buy her a cup of sweet ice. 
You knew I was that little girl?

57:29.200 --> 57:35.570
Didn't you ever wonder why Mameha 
took you under her wing?

57:35.770 --> 57:38.170
Mameha came to me because of you.

57:46.390 --> 57:49.420
I wish you could have told me long ago.

57:49.420 --> 57:53.650
What could I do?
I owe Nobu my life.

57:53.830 --> 58:00.830
And so, when I saw he had a chance
at happiness with you, I stood silent.

58:01.840 --> 58:04.830
But...

58:06.580 --> 58:15.380
But I cannot any longer.
I hope...it is not too late.

58:20.260 --> 58:25.760
Don't be afraid to look at me - Chiyo.

58:36.810 --> 58:42.510
Can't you see? Every step I have taken,

58:43.510 --> 58:46.510
since I was that child on the bridge,

58:46.890 --> 58:55.490
has been to bring myself closer to you.

59:57.380 --> 01:00:05.150
You cannot say to the sun "more sun," 
or to the rain "less rain."

01:00:05.550 --> 01:00:09.180
To a man Geisha can only be half a wife.

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:17.060
We are the wives of nightfall.
And yet to learn of kindness...

01:00:17.370 --> 01:00:18.920
...after so much unkindness.

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:25.670
To understand that a little girl
with more courage than she knew,

01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:32.880
would find that her prayers were answered, 
can that not be called happiness?

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:41.190
After all, these are not the memoirs of an
empress, nor of a queen...

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:44.220
...these are memoirs of another kind.

01:00:45.305 --> 01:00:51.638
