Is this your first club weekend?

00:06.956 --> 00:08.331
Yeah, I've only done
one-nighters.

00:08.414 --> 00:09.331
I miss you.

00:09.414 --> 00:10.831
I'm in a comedy condo.

00:11.081 --> 00:13.289
I feel like
I'm on witness protection.

00:14.498 --> 00:16.414
Hey.
Are you working this weekend?

00:16.623 --> 00:17.665
Yeah, I just saw the lineup.

00:17.748 --> 00:19.873
We could've, you know,
come up together.

00:19.956 --> 00:21.039
PETE: Yeah, I wish I had known.

00:21.414 --> 00:24.164
-I'm actually
dating somebody now, so.
-Cool.

make people happy, darling?

Remind them of your faith.

00:27.997 --> 00:30.206
I'm six-foot-six.
I kind of look like Goliath

00:30.289 --> 00:31.456
if he went to prep school.

00:31.539 --> 00:32.414
Does that make sense?

00:32.498 --> 00:33.539
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

00:33.623 --> 00:34.665
You gotta get up
when you can get up.

00:34.748 --> 00:35.581
You gotta grind it.

00:35.915 --> 00:37.956
I'm sorta considering
doing this Christian tour.

00:38.414 --> 00:40.539
I meant--
I mean, real comedy.

00:40.623 --> 00:41.456
Right.

00:41.873 --> 00:43.581

No. I was a mess
in high school.

02:41.498 --> 02:45.122
I was tall and gangly,
and I was on swim team,

02:45.206 --> 02:47.915
so I smelled like
chlorine all the time.

02:47.997 --> 02:49.997

This is big
for a high school.

03:00.247 --> 03:01.539
Yeah.

03:02.039 --> 03:04.748
It's like a campus.
It was bigger
than my college.

03:04.831 --> 03:06.665
And right here,
once a year,

03:06.748 --> 03:09.039
we'd all do
"See You at the Pole."

03:09.122 --> 03:10.831
What is that?

03:10.915 --> 03:12.539
Once a year,
the Christian kids

03:12.623 --> 03:15.164
would hold hands
around the flagpole and pray.

-Is that legal?
-I have no idea.

03:17.414 --> 03:18.915
(chuckles)

03:18.997 --> 03:21.498
Your school didn't have
"See You at the Pole?"
It was a national thing.

03:21.581 --> 03:23.665
No, we just bought drugs
by the pole.

03:23.748 --> 03:24.748

-Do you want
to pray right now?

Although,
maybe we should.

High school Pete thinks
what grown-up Pete is doing

03:35.623 --> 03:37.831
is very, very bad.

03:37.915 --> 03:39.373

Well, I'll fix that.

uh, New Jersey,
at a club?

04:39.414 --> 04:41.581
-Did you fuck this girl?
-No! God!

04:41.665 --> 04:43.748
It's nothing--
It's not like that at all.

04:43.831 --> 04:45.498

It's a friend.

04:45.581 --> 04:47.247
It's, uh--
We're barely friends.

04:47.331 --> 04:49.331
She's my--
You know, we dated,

04:49.414 --> 04:53.873
-a while ago, and then, um...
-Okay, so it's someone
that you used to fuck.

04:55.081 --> 04:56.414
Um, hold on.

04:56.498 --> 04:59.581
I know it sounds weird,
but it was just work.

04:59.665 --> 05:01.456
It was-- That's somebody
I work with,

05:01.539 --> 05:03.997
and we had a thing,
and that's over.

05:04.081 --> 05:06.748
And I got to the condo,
and she was there.

05:06.831 --> 05:09.414
Wait. You stayed
in the same condo together?

05:09.498 --> 05:12.247
Kitty, I don't-- I...
I don't know what I--

05:12.331 --> 05:14.414
-I don't know what I did.
-You don't know what you did?

05:14.498 --> 05:16.289
-I was doing my job.
-What you did is you lied.

05:16.373 --> 05:19.456
-I didn't lie. I didn't know.
-No, you omitted the truth.

05:19.539 --> 05:22.373
I just, you know,
to find the right moment.

05:22.456 --> 05:23.873
I didn't want to hurt
your feelings,

05:23.956 --> 05:25.790

for you to be

05:25.873 --> 05:27.873

but not right before the move.

-Oh, you're so tall!

You didn't tell me
she was so tall.

This is Kat.
Yep, she's tall.

a fucked up dynamic
with my mom, too,

09:50.748 --> 09:54.164
but we figured it out
and have worked through it.

09:55.164 --> 09:59.956
It's hard to break away
when your parents are
abusive, so...

10:00.831 --> 10:03.706
She-- she's a lot,
but it's not--

10:03.790 --> 10:05.081
I don't think it's abusive.

10:05.164 --> 10:07.915
No, it is. That's called
"emotional incest,"

10:07.997 --> 10:10.373
and it's really bad
for both of you,

10:10.456 --> 10:13.373
and for your dad
who has to watch
all of this.

10:14.122 --> 10:15.665
(clears throat)

10:17.081 --> 10:20.122
I'm really sorry
about New Jersey,

10:20.206 --> 10:21.706
with Ali.

10:21.790 --> 10:24.373
I don't even have
to think about it.

10:25.331 --> 10:27.915
As soon as you said it,
I felt terrible.

10:28.539 --> 10:30.414
And I'm really sorry,

10:30.498 --> 10:32.039
and I love you.

10:34.122 --> 10:35.498
I love you, too.

10:36.081 --> 10:38.915
-Thank God.
-You got a little nervous
there for a second.

10:38.997 --> 10:40.081
Yeah.

10:43.039 --> 10:44.039
Sleep good.

10:44.122 --> 10:46.581
Can you just stay?

10:46.665 --> 10:47.956
I want to.

10:48.039 --> 10:51.247
I really want to sleep in this
haunted dollhouse with you.

10:51.331 --> 10:52.414
-I really do.
-Yeah.

10:52.498 --> 10:54.997
Just join me
in this nightmare room.

10:55.081 --> 10:57.706
If you smell smoke,
it's the echoes of murder.

10:57.790 --> 10:59.122
-I'm teasing.
-Stop it.

10:59.206 --> 11:01.247
-Good night.
-I love you.

11:01.331 --> 11:02.539
I love you.

11:02.997 --> 11:04.665
Don't worry about church.

11:04.748 --> 11:06.581
-Okay.
-It's a piece of cake.

11:07.081 --> 11:11.247
You stand, you sing, you sit,
you listen, you pray.

11:11.873 --> 11:13.414
Then we're at lunch.

11:14.331 --> 11:15.831
Okay, sounds complicated.

11:15.915 --> 11:17.289
-Piece of cake.
-I trust you.

11:17.373 --> 11:19.498
-Okay.
-Okay, good night.

11:19.581 --> 11:21.039
Okay, good night.

11:22.373 --> 11:23.748
You'll be okay.

11:24.873 --> 11:27.247
-It's not haunted.
-Okay.

11:27.331 --> 11:29.581
Those clocks have
no batteries, but...

11:30.414 --> 11:32.122
it's not haunted.

11:32.206 --> 11:34.581

I haven't seen them
move in years!

We shout to you, Father God,

12:20.498 --> 12:22.623
that you might hear our prayer.

12:23.373 --> 12:26.873
And a reminder to continue
to lift up Ben and Whitney

12:26.956 --> 12:28.456
at our sister church in Uganda,

12:28.539 --> 12:31.122
as they continue
to struggle with dysentery.

12:32.498 --> 12:34.081
And now at this time,
we invite you

12:34.164 --> 12:36.498
to stand and greet
your neighbor.

12:37.206 --> 12:38.956
You just-- you just
say hello.

12:39.039 --> 12:40.289
-Oh my God.
-Just shake my hand.

12:40.373 --> 12:42.331
-This is so scary.
-It's okay. Just look at me.

12:42.414 --> 12:44.915
-Hi. Peace be with you.
-Hi. Thank you.

12:44.997 --> 12:47.289
-You say, "And also with you."
-Do I have to?

12:47.373 --> 12:48.748
-Absolutely not.
-Great.

12:48.831 --> 12:50.206
Good luck.
Have fun.

12:50.289 --> 12:52.081
-Hi. Blessed be the fruit.
-Woman: It's nice to see you.

12:52.164 --> 12:53.456
Woman:
Peace be with you.

12:53.539 --> 12:56.706
I love this cardigan on you.
It's a great color.

12:57.539 --> 12:59.831
-Hi. Shabbat shalom.
-Oh, thank you.

12:59.915 --> 13:04.373
"But whoever drinks
the water that I give them
will never thirst.

13:04.456 --> 13:07.915
"Indeed, the water I give them
will become in them..."

13:07.997 --> 13:09.206
Living water.

13:09.289 --> 13:14.456
"...a spring of water,
welling up to eternal life."

13:14.539 --> 13:16.665
Now, what Jesus
is asking us, here,

13:16.748 --> 13:19.581
is to see past
our own physical needs...

13:19.665 --> 13:22.081
-Look past the problem.
-Shh!

13:22.164 --> 13:25.539
...and live life
on the spiritual plane.

13:25.997 --> 13:28.581
-In the world...
-But not of it.

13:28.665 --> 13:29.498
...but not of it.

13:29.581 --> 13:30.539
Shh.

13:31.122 --> 13:33.873
-That wasn't so bad, right?
-It was okay.

13:34.331 --> 13:36.456
Um, what's going on
with your dad?

13:36.539 --> 13:38.956
-Is he losing his hearing?
-Yeah, we don't know.

13:39.039 --> 13:41.997
-Oh, no.
-Come on, I want to show
you off to the pastor.

13:42.081 --> 13:44.456
Pete: Oh, um, sure.
I'm gonna grab a coffee.
Do you want one?

13:44.539 --> 13:46.539
We're fine, dear.

13:46.915 --> 13:48.498
-You?
-Yeah.

13:48.581 --> 13:51.331
Okay, see you in a second.

13:54.247 --> 13:56.665
That was a lovely service,
wasn't it?

13:56.748 --> 13:57.997
Yeah, it was beautiful.

13:58.081 --> 14:00.039
The pastor certainly
has a way with words.

14:00.122 --> 14:02.331
-Mm-hmm.
-He's done some acting,
you know.

14:02.414 --> 14:05.831
-Oh my gosh!
-Last year, he did
the Sermon on the Mount

14:05.915 --> 14:08.456
-from memory.
-Wow.

14:09.289 --> 14:11.414
Are you excited
about the show tonight?

14:11.498 --> 14:13.247
Oh, we're so excited.

14:13.331 --> 14:17.581
I'm so glad the Lord is using
Peter's gift for His purpose.

14:17.665 --> 14:19.748
He's always had a calling.

14:19.831 --> 14:23.331
Yeah. I think this is gonna be
so good for his brand.

14:23.414 --> 14:25.414
Like, this is his market.

14:25.915 --> 14:29.498
Well, it's not his brand.
It's his heart.

14:29.581 --> 14:32.873
He's found a path that falls
in line with his faith.

14:32.956 --> 14:36.873
I think Peter's spirituality is
a little more fluid these days,

14:36.956 --> 14:38.623
like mine.

14:39.289 --> 14:40.498
Oh.

14:40.581 --> 14:42.081
Were you raised in the church?

14:42.164 --> 14:45.956
I wasn't raised
with anything formal, um...

14:46.039 --> 14:49.539
But I just sort of believe
that God is in all of us.

14:49.623 --> 14:53.706
You know, like...
we're all God in drag, you know?

14:53.790 --> 14:55.289
It's just consciousness.

14:55.373 --> 14:57.498
Like, I don't pray,

14:57.581 --> 15:01.373
I just listen to the part
of me that is God.

15:01.456 --> 15:03.122
So you think you're God?

15:03.206 --> 15:06.247
Yeah, but I think
you're God, too.

15:06.331 --> 15:07.915
Sweetheart, God is God.

15:08.956 --> 15:11.039
The ocean is made of water,

15:11.122 --> 15:13.039
but we're all made
of water, too.

15:13.122 --> 15:14.581
Yeah...

15:14.665 --> 15:15.956
but you're not the ocean.

15:16.039 --> 15:18.247
The ocean is the ocean.

15:18.331 --> 15:20.206
You're a human being.

15:20.289 --> 15:23.581
I think we're saying
the same thing,
just with different words.

15:23.665 --> 15:25.247
-Oh.
-(chuckles)

15:25.331 --> 15:27.164
Uh, I'm gonna go
get a coffee.

15:27.915 --> 15:29.331
I'll be right back.

15:32.498 --> 15:33.915
You sure
you don't want to come?

15:33.997 --> 15:37.122
Massachusetts is at its least
depressing this time of year.

15:37.206 --> 15:39.915
I'm good, uh,
it's been only a day,

15:39.997 --> 15:42.873
and I've already heard
some of your dad's jokes
twice, so...

15:42.956 --> 15:44.498
Yeah, that's my dad.

15:45.164 --> 15:46.414
If you come to lunch,
I guarantee,

15:46.498 --> 15:48.081
he'll call ketchup
"Irish gravy."

15:48.164 --> 15:49.665
Yeah, I already
heard that one.

15:49.748 --> 15:50.665
-Really?
-Yes.

15:50.748 --> 15:51.831
Have you heard
him say, "I don't

15:51.915 --> 15:53.164
drink water,
fish make love in it?"

15:53.247 --> 15:54.247
Heard 'em all.

15:54.331 --> 15:55.997
It's W.C. Fields.
He stole it.

15:56.081 --> 15:57.498
It's pretty good.

15:57.581 --> 15:59.915
Also, this way, I can keep on
looking through your yearbook

15:59.997 --> 16:02.790
and snoop around
your childhood bedroom.

16:02.873 --> 16:04.539
You're not gonna find
anything good except

16:04.623 --> 16:08.164
a pretty mild nursing bra
catalog in the top drawer.

16:08.247 --> 16:09.498
Yum.

16:10.206 --> 16:12.539
-We won't be long.
-Bye.

16:13.997 --> 16:15.081
Asshole.

16:15.623 --> 16:17.331
And I had a crush on her.

16:17.414 --> 16:19.956
-(giggles)
-Have fun.

16:20.039 --> 16:22.039
-Bye.
-Bye.

16:24.206 --> 16:26.997
What are your three favorite
parks in Brooklyn, Peter?

16:27.790 --> 16:29.498
I'd have to think
about that, Dad.

16:30.206 --> 16:32.081
Isn't it beautiful?

16:32.164 --> 16:33.122
It is.

16:33.206 --> 16:34.748
It's really nice
to be back, Mama.

16:34.831 --> 16:36.039
Oh.

16:37.247 --> 16:39.831
How are, uh...
How are you and Dad doing?

16:39.915 --> 16:44.164
Oh, your father is
a pain in the neck.

16:44.247 --> 16:46.956
He's always there.

16:47.039 --> 16:49.081
He doesn't listen.

16:49.164 --> 16:51.873
We don't talk like
you and I do.

16:51.956 --> 16:54.665
I wish you'd come
home more often.

16:54.748 --> 16:57.247
I'm only happy
when you're here.

16:57.997 --> 16:59.289
I'm here now.

16:59.373 --> 17:01.956
-Oh my gosh.
-Look at that haircut.

17:02.039 --> 17:04.081
Isn't that outrageous?

17:06.997 --> 17:08.581
Isn't Kat great?

17:09.164 --> 17:11.331
Yes, she's lovely.

17:11.414 --> 17:12.873
Yeah, it's...

17:12.956 --> 17:15.539
really important to me
that you like her, you know?

17:15.623 --> 17:17.915
-Mm. I do.
-Really important. Yeah.

17:17.997 --> 17:21.498
She's certainly her
own person, isn't she?

17:21.581 --> 17:23.289
What does that mean?

17:23.373 --> 17:25.039
Petey, I don't want
to be discouraging.

17:25.122 --> 17:27.539
No, I want to know.
I want to know what you think.

17:27.623 --> 17:29.206
It's just us.

17:29.289 --> 17:33.706
Well, I'm sure she's fun
for a good time and all.

17:33.790 --> 17:35.748
-And she's very exciting.
-Mom.

17:35.831 --> 17:41.539
She has a very interesting
take on how the world works.

17:41.623 --> 17:44.873
She didn't grow up
in an evangelical super church.

17:44.956 --> 17:46.039
Is that what you mean?

17:46.122 --> 17:49.498
I mean she's a little
New Age for me.

17:49.581 --> 17:53.164
That's just
very popular right now.

17:53.247 --> 17:55.331
She read
some Deepak Chopra.

17:55.414 --> 17:56.997
She has
an Eckhart Tolle calender.

17:57.081 --> 17:59.581
She reads me the quotes.
He quotes Jesus all the time.

17:59.665 --> 18:02.956
-Oh.
-It's not as far out
as you might think.

18:03.039 --> 18:05.956
-So she's deep?
-Pak Chopra.

18:06.039 --> 18:07.915
(laughing)

18:07.997 --> 18:11.706
She's just not
as sweet as my Petey.

18:12.206 --> 18:14.790
Rita! Squirrels!

18:18.081 --> 18:19.831
I'm sorry about him.

18:20.623 --> 18:22.247
So am I.

18:22.331 --> 18:24.331
I'll try
with this new girl.

18:25.956 --> 18:27.206
Would you?

18:27.289 --> 18:29.831
You guys are weirdos.
You know that, right?

18:30.873 --> 18:32.997
We're not a normal family.

18:33.081 --> 18:34.498
No, I know.

18:35.331 --> 18:37.456
♪ ♪

18:39.498 --> 18:41.706
Is-- is this

18:50.915 --> 18:52.706
My cup runneth over, huh?

18:52.997 --> 18:54.623
Yeah, this is
a crazy spread.

18:54.706 --> 18:56.081
I've never seen
anything like it.

18:56.623 --> 18:58.456
I'm Pete, by the way.
I'm a comic.

18:58.539 --> 19:00.206
Oh, me too. Fudge.

19:00.289 --> 19:01.706
-Fudge?
-Yeah.

19:01.790 --> 19:03.247
That's--
that's not your name?

19:03.331 --> 19:04.623
No, no.
My real name is John,

19:04.706 --> 19:06.373
but Fudge is
an acronym I go by--

19:06.456 --> 19:08.581
Funny Unique Devoted
Gentleman Entertainer.

19:08.665 --> 19:10.873
Yeah, based on just
this brief interaction,

19:10.956 --> 19:12.539
I think you're very fudgy.

19:12.623 --> 19:15.081
(laughing)
Thank you.

19:15.623 --> 19:16.997
I didn't see you
at the last show.

19:17.081 --> 19:19.206
Ah, yeah, man,
I was on the road.

19:19.289 --> 19:21.331
-Oh.
-Yeah, I do clubs, too.

19:21.414 --> 19:24.373
You know, I was
in Utah, Disney.

19:24.456 --> 19:25.748
-Disney?
-Disney.

19:25.831 --> 19:28.790
-You did stand-up comedy
at Disney?
-In Disney, yeah.

19:28.873 --> 19:31.206
That's incredible!
They let you
in the park for free?

19:31.289 --> 19:32.581
Yeah, and after hours, too.

19:32.665 --> 19:34.623
You get this tour
when nobody's there, man.

19:34.706 --> 19:37.748
-It's awesome. Yeah.
-Get out.

19:38.414 --> 19:42.081
Word of advice:
Don't follow the ventriloquist.

19:42.665 --> 19:45.289
'Cause a ventriloquist
can say whatever he wants

19:45.373 --> 19:47.665
'cause the audience thinks
the dummy don't have a soul.

19:47.748 --> 19:50.247
-Is that true?
-It's true.

19:50.331 --> 19:52.122
All right, guys,
let's circle up.

19:56.373 --> 19:58.039
All right, let's...

19:59.748 --> 20:02.081
Dear Heavenly Father,
thank you so much
for the opportunity

20:02.164 --> 20:06.498
to perform this evening,
and we pray that we'd

20:06.581 --> 20:09.122
And we pray all this
in the mighty name of Jesus.

-All: Amen.

20:45.081 --> 20:46.623

21:36.164 --> 21:38.039
(laughter)

21:38.122 --> 21:39.831
But think about it.
Really think about it.

21:39.915 --> 21:41.873
Heaven should have WiFi,
you know what I'm saying?

21:41.956 --> 21:43.414
They got unlimited cloud space.

21:43.498 --> 21:44.748
(laughter)

21:44.831 --> 21:46.748
There's a terabyte right here,
know what I'm saying?

21:46.831 --> 21:49.956
Look at that terabyte,
know what I'm saying?

21:50.039 --> 21:51.873
Think about it,
Heaven should have WiFi,

21:51.956 --> 21:54.665
'cause I know Hell got a lot
of hot spots, and then, uh...

21:54.748 --> 21:57.997
(laughter and applause)

21:58.081 --> 22:00.039
They ain't gonna be worrying
about reception down there.

They gonna be on Snaptchat

22:02.206 --> 22:03.456

22:03.539 --> 22:06.456
(laughter and applause)

22:06.539 --> 22:08.081
I love all of the miracles.

22:08.164 --> 22:10.498
I love that Jesus raised
Lazarus from the dead.

22:10.581 --> 22:12.206
That's a big one.

22:12.623 --> 22:16.706
Do you think there's even
a small chance that Lazarus

22:16.790 --> 22:18.706
didn't want to be
raised from the dead?

22:18.790 --> 22:20.414
(laughter)

22:20.498 --> 22:22.414
Like, nobody asked Lazarus.

22:22.956 --> 22:24.665
He was dead.

22:24.748 --> 22:26.164
So his family--

22:26.247 --> 22:27.915
family, you can't trust family.

22:27.997 --> 22:31.122
The family assumed
he didn't want to be dead.

22:31.206 --> 22:32.997
Maybe Lazarus wanted to be dead.

22:33.081 --> 22:35.956
Can you imagine if Jesus raised
him, and Lazarus came up like,

22:36.039 --> 22:38.122
(inhales)
"Oh, man!"

22:38.206 --> 22:39.665
(laughter)

22:39.748 --> 22:41.581
"This again?

22:42.748 --> 22:44.831
I was just in Heaven.
You were there."

22:44.915 --> 22:46.331
(laughter)

22:46.414 --> 22:49.831
"The deposit on my funeral
was non-refundable."

22:49.915 --> 22:50.997
(laughter)

22:51.081 --> 22:53.081
"I was gonna break up
with my girlfriend.

22:53.831 --> 22:54.831
Now I have to do it."

22:54.956 --> 22:56.997
(laughter and applause)

23:01.581 --> 23:05.581
My goodness, seeing you
on that stage with the cross,

23:05.665 --> 23:07.706
you just looked
so right at home.

23:07.790 --> 23:08.956
You were so great.

23:09.039 --> 23:10.665
Wasn't it a great show?
Everybody's so good.

23:10.748 --> 23:13.748
-You were the best part.
-Oh, you must be so proud.

23:13.831 --> 23:15.997
-She's adorable.
-Oh, thank you.

23:16.081 --> 23:18.373

23:20.539 --> 23:22.623
Oh. Have a good evening.

23:22.706 --> 23:24.414
-Good night.
-You were so awesome.

23:24.498 --> 23:26.039
Are we, uh, gonna get dinner?

23:26.122 --> 23:29.539
Yes, Carol's working at Legal.

23:29.623 --> 23:31.956
-Great.
-Peter...

23:32.039 --> 23:35.039
What do you think is the most
important trait for a performer?

23:35.122 --> 23:36.456
Confidence?

23:37.289 --> 23:39.997
-I don't know, Dad.
-I think it's confidence.

23:40.623 --> 23:43.331
FDR, he had confidence.

23:43.414 --> 23:46.790
Right. Yeah. No,
he's one of the greats.

23:46.873 --> 23:48.997

I need to put on a bra?

23:49.081 --> 23:50.164

is very distracting.

23:53.247 --> 23:54.623
Hold on.
What are you doing?

23:54.706 --> 23:56.247
She just told me
to put on a bra.

23:56.331 --> 23:57.665
Well, are you
wearing a bra?

23:57.748 --> 23:59.164
-Is that your business?
-Mom!

23:59.247 --> 24:01.790
It's my business when you're
sitting next to me in church.

24:01.873 --> 24:03.623

it's a comedy show.

She made your father
feel very uncomfortable.

24:08.790 --> 24:11.997
Really? Dad complained about
my girlfriend wearing a bra?

24:12.081 --> 24:15.081
No, I could feel how
uncomfortable he was,

24:15.164 --> 24:16.623
and every man in there.

24:16.706 --> 24:18.915
Jesus, Mom! How is that
supposed to make her feel?

24:18.997 --> 24:20.790
-Peter, watch your mouth!
-No!

24:20.873 --> 24:22.456
Well, what if--
what if her parents

24:22.539 --> 24:24.414
told me that my pants
are too tight,

24:24.498 --> 24:26.039
that they can see my cock?

24:26.122 --> 24:27.122

-It's okay.

24:27.206 --> 24:28.873
