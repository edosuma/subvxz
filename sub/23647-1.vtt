WEBVTT

00:15.975 --> 00:17.393
Obsolete.

00:17.518 --> 00:22.231
Irrelevant in an age when
desire has become amplified.

00:22.356 --> 00:25.943
But where lust can be sated
electronically.

00:26.068 --> 00:28.446
We need something more
than just a wooden box.

00:28.571 --> 00:30.656
There is a mechanism.

00:30.781 --> 00:33.200
The house is ready.
We can adapt.

00:33.325 --> 00:34.744
Technology
may have advanced,

00:34.869 --> 00:37.455
but sin remains unchanged.

00:37.580 --> 00:40.082
Pure. Greed.

00:40.207 --> 00:43.252
Lust. Lies. Betrayal.

00:43.377 --> 00:46.338
- This new millennium
hurtles forward.

00:46.464 --> 00:47.631
Faith is lost.

00:47.757 --> 00:51.427
Mankind have become
a vacuum without morality.

00:51.552 --> 00:54.889
So many souls seeking
new and darker experiences.

00:55.014 --> 00:59.018
Degradation upon degradation,
sin after sin.

00:59.143 --> 01:03.189
- So then those are the souls
we shall seek out first.

01:34.678 --> 01:36.013
:
"Mr. Watkins,

01:36.138 --> 01:37.890
"we know, we understand,

01:38.015 --> 01:40.851
"and we can help,
but you must come.

01:40.976 --> 01:43.729
"Come now
before it's too late.

01:43.854 --> 01:46.315
"Come to 55 Ludovico Place.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.567
"Alone. Now.

01:48.692 --> 01:50.528
A sympathetic friend."

02:14.135 --> 02:15.261
Ah, Mr. Watkins.

02:15.386 --> 02:16.887
So good of you to come.

02:17.012 --> 02:18.806
We have such sights
to show you.

02:18.931 --> 02:21.267
Please, step inside.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.538
Mr. Watkins.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.790
What the fuck is going on?

02:44.915 --> 02:46.750
What the fuck are you?

02:46.876 --> 02:48.127
What are you doing to me?

02:48.252 --> 02:50.045
Asshole!
All valid questions.

02:50.171 --> 02:51.714
What the fuck is going on?

02:51.839 --> 02:53.215
Mr. Watkins, please.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.009
Please assess your situation.

02:55.134 --> 02:56.927
Look at your environment.

02:57.052 --> 02:59.346
For now,
you are merely captive.

02:59.471 --> 03:01.015
Sitting, tied to a chair.

03:01.140 --> 03:03.434
If we wanted you killed,
then you would be.

03:03.559 --> 03:05.936
We have simply
invited you here to talk.

03:06.061 --> 03:08.606
To hear your thoughts
and desires.

03:08.731 --> 03:10.983
Furthermore, if they're
as interesting and illuminating

03:11.108 --> 03:12.151
as I believe them to be,

03:12.276 --> 03:14.737
then your reward will be
beyond your belief.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.405
A reward?

03:16.530 --> 03:17.656
A reward tailored for a man

03:17.781 --> 03:19.825
of your particular
tastes and desires.

03:21.243 --> 03:22.536
You know about me?

03:23.537 --> 03:24.705
You know the things I've done?

03:24.830 --> 03:26.749
- It is that resume of yours
that led us to you

03:26.874 --> 03:28.584
and in turn you to us.

03:28.709 --> 03:29.543
Who are you?

03:29.668 --> 03:32.421
- Yes.
Perhaps a little illumination.

03:32.546 --> 03:35.257
Please, try not to be
too alarmed.

03:41.096 --> 03:43.557
Oh, Jesus Christ!

03:43.682 --> 03:45.059
Heavens, no!

03:45.184 --> 03:47.519
Same city. Completely
different zip code.

03:49.104 --> 03:51.607
What is going on here?
What... where am I?

03:51.732 --> 03:54.401
- Mr. Watkins, we really must
begin your interview.

03:54.526 --> 03:58.113
So many people for you to see,
so let's just dive in, shall we?

04:15.756 --> 04:18.050
August 18, 2001,

04:18.175 --> 04:20.970
you lured little
Courtney Rettison to your car.

04:21.095 --> 04:22.304
Why?

04:22.429 --> 04:26.058
- I... I... how do you know?
- Please.

04:26.183 --> 04:28.310
Let's save ourselves the time

04:28.435 --> 04:29.895
and you the considerable pain

04:30.020 --> 04:32.147
by answering the questions
honestly.

04:32.273 --> 04:33.357
Clearly this is a place

04:33.482 --> 04:36.402
where the rules of your world
do not apply.

04:36.527 --> 04:38.487
And obviously,
I'm a man for whom

04:38.612 --> 04:41.573
pain is nothing more
than a common currency.

04:44.451 --> 04:49.832
- I will spend some on you...
if you like.

04:53.419 --> 04:57.006
I- I'd seen her at the, uh,
the playground before.

05:00.467 --> 05:02.720
I couldn't help myself.

05:02.845 --> 05:04.013
I understand.

05:04.138 --> 05:05.597
I was just trying to help.

05:05.723 --> 05:06.974
Yes, yes.

05:10.352 --> 05:13.022
She had blonde hair.

05:13.147 --> 05:16.483
Long, and...
it was in a ponytail.

05:18.152 --> 05:21.864
I've never seen so much blood
from a little creature.

05:30.080 --> 05:34.168
- My, my. Quite the busy bee
we've been, Mr. Watkins.

05:34.293 --> 05:35.377
What about my reward?

05:35.502 --> 05:37.212
- First of all, you will meet
with the assessor.

05:37.338 --> 05:38.630
He will look over your pages,

05:38.756 --> 05:40.758
pass on his findings
to the jury,

05:40.883 --> 05:42.384
and we'll go from there.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.553
The assessor
will be with you shortly.

05:53.270 --> 05:54.355
Aagh!

06:15.459 --> 06:18.837
Tears... of children.

07:07.219 --> 07:08.637
What?

07:10.472 --> 07:12.015
What?

07:21.859 --> 07:24.570
- Serves you right,
you sick fuck!

08:29.801 --> 08:32.221
Ladies, your verdict.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.643
Guilty.

08:41.688 --> 08:42.856
The jury have deliberated,

08:42.981 --> 08:44.525
and a guilty verdict
has been given.

08:44.650 --> 08:45.609
What?

08:45.734 --> 08:46.902
- You'll be taken from here
to be cleaned

08:47.027 --> 08:47.986
and then to the Surgeon.

08:48.111 --> 08:49.655
But what about my reward?

08:49.780 --> 08:52.407
Your note said you understood.

08:52.533 --> 08:53.909
It said you were a friend.

08:54.034 --> 08:57.829
- I do understand.
This is your reward.

08:57.955 --> 09:01.792
This is what you're
deserving of, my friend.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.093
Please!

09:12.427 --> 09:13.845
I'll be better!

09:13.971 --> 09:15.681
I'll be good!

09:15.806 --> 09:17.558
What?
Who is it? Who is it?

09:21.645 --> 09:23.689
Who is it?

09:33.448 --> 09:37.202
Help me.
Please help me, please.

09:40.872 --> 09:44.501
Ah, no. Please!

09:44.626 --> 09:48.505
Help! What the fuck
are you doing to me? Stop!

09:48.630 --> 09:54.011
You must be clean
on the inside, too.

09:59.308 --> 10:00.976
Help!

10:03.228 --> 10:05.063
Help!

14:11.726 --> 14:14.104
Uber Black, my ass!

14:14.229 --> 14:16.523
It's just this piece of shit!

14:34.541 --> 14:36.001
What the hell?

14:39.713 --> 14:41.631
Josh?

14:41.756 --> 14:43.508
You in my apartment again?

14:45.051 --> 14:48.138
I told you that you need to
give me my key back.

14:48.263 --> 14:52.934
Okay. This late-night
bootie call shit is over!

14:53.059 --> 14:58.398
Although I could
probably go for a quickie...

14:58.523 --> 15:01.234
for old times' sake.

15:03.528 --> 15:05.906
Jo-s-s-h.

15:09.743 --> 15:12.996
Okay.
I'm drying up real fast here.

15:13.121 --> 15:16.416
This weirdo-in-the-dark thing
is only a turn-on

15:16.541 --> 15:19.628
for like a few minutes.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.212
And... and where's my dog?

15:21.338 --> 15:23.214
Baby?

15:23.340 --> 15:25.634
Fuck this!

15:28.136 --> 15:31.097
Seriously? What the fuck
have you done with the lights?

15:45.362 --> 15:47.113
What do you want?

15:47.238 --> 15:49.324
To make a lesson out of you.

16:02.212 --> 16:04.047
You look like shit.

16:05.966 --> 16:07.467
What'd you do last night?

16:09.803 --> 16:11.972
Wonderful. Yeah.

16:12.097 --> 16:14.432
I had a great time last night.
Thank you for asking.

16:18.561 --> 16:21.940
You can take a left
two blocks up the way on Taylor.

16:22.065 --> 16:24.985
Victim is one Crystal Lanning,
21 years old.

16:25.110 --> 16:26.403
Building super
found her this afternoon.

16:26.528 --> 16:28.655
- I went out with a girl
called Crystal.

16:28.780 --> 16:30.573
It speaks!

16:30.699 --> 16:31.700
What was that like?

16:31.825 --> 16:33.827
<i>Like A Tale of Two Cities.</i>

16:33.952 --> 16:34.995
A what?

16:35.120 --> 16:36.788
Charles Dickens.

16:36.913 --> 16:38.331
Right.

16:38.456 --> 16:40.125
Like anyone reads
that shit anymore.

16:40.250 --> 16:42.877
- It's the most popular
fictional book on the planet.

16:43.003 --> 16:45.296
- So why is this Crystal chick
like the book?

16:47.590 --> 16:48.675
Read it.

16:50.635 --> 16:51.886
We're here.

16:52.012 --> 16:53.263
Good.

16:55.306 --> 16:56.516
Worship this little guy.

16:56.641 --> 16:58.018
The place has
been cleared, locked down.

16:58.143 --> 16:59.060
Everyone's been told
to hold back

16:59.185 --> 17:01.855
until we make our pass
in case it's him.

17:03.732 --> 17:05.608
<i>I worship
this little guy.</i>

17:05.733 --> 17:07.193
<i>I worship
this little guy.</i>

17:07.318 --> 17:09.069
<i>I worship
this little guy.</i>

17:09.194 --> 17:11.573
<i>I worship
this little guy.</i>

17:11.698 --> 17:13.241
<i>I worship
this little guy.</i>

17:13.366 --> 17:15.326
<i>I worship this little...
- Nice.</i>

17:15.452 --> 17:17.203
<i>I worship
this little guy.</i>

17:17.328 --> 17:19.622
<i>I worship
this little guy.</i>

17:19.748 --> 17:21.665
<i>I worship
this little guy.</i>

17:30.550 --> 17:31.760
It's him.

17:33.928 --> 17:35.388
It's definitely him.

17:35.513 --> 17:36.723
You think?

17:44.272 --> 17:46.649
- Doesn't this seem a bit basic
for the Preceptor?

17:46.775 --> 17:48.068
Who the fuck are you?

17:48.193 --> 17:49.027
What are you doing
creeping around

17:49.152 --> 17:50.445
a murder scene
at nighttime?

17:50.570 --> 17:51.613
You want to end up dead?

17:51.738 --> 17:53.406
Detectives Carter and Carter.

17:53.531 --> 17:56.618
Brothers in arms...
literally.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.161
Detective Egerton.

17:58.286 --> 18:00.163
I've been assigned
to this case with you.

18:00.288 --> 18:02.248
- You got her?
- I got her.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.214
Detective Christine Egerton.

18:12.008 --> 18:13.093
Do you mind?

18:13.218 --> 18:14.135
Why are you here?

18:14.260 --> 18:15.804
Who thinks we need
help with this?

18:15.929 --> 18:17.138
Like I was saying,

18:17.263 --> 18:20.433
isn't this just a bit basic
for the Preceptor?

18:20.558 --> 18:22.435
I mean,
I was under the impression

18:22.560 --> 18:26.022
that he liked to shock,
appall, teach.

18:26.147 --> 18:27.690
And that?

18:27.816 --> 18:28.775
"I am a jealous God.

18:28.900 --> 18:30.527
Thou shalt have
no others unto me"?

18:30.652 --> 18:31.986
It's one of the remaining
commandments,

18:32.112 --> 18:33.321
and it's part of his MO.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.240
I think
that it's just a stunt.

18:36.282 --> 18:38.409
What was that?
- Jesus Christ!

18:43.123 --> 18:44.457
What the fuck is that?

18:46.626 --> 18:48.628
- Has anyone seen
the dog in the video?

18:54.551 --> 18:56.010
Fuck!

19:04.394 --> 19:06.354
It's okay.

19:06.479 --> 19:07.730
It's okay.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.860
Baby.

19:11.985 --> 19:14.362
The dog was her baby.

19:15.989 --> 19:17.740
So he put it into her womb.

19:17.866 --> 19:19.450
I'll call it in.

19:41.306 --> 19:44.184
Alison's birthday. Shit!

19:46.186 --> 19:47.312
Nice.

19:47.437 --> 19:51.858
It's uh, very 1940s
detective agency.

19:51.983 --> 19:54.402
Do we still smoke stogies
and have scotch for breakfast?

19:54.527 --> 19:57.363
- What we're investigating
is very dark.

19:57.488 --> 19:58.948
Fluorescents
give me a migraine.

19:59.073 --> 20:02.327
- Look, I know that me coming
here must be a bit of a shock.

20:02.452 --> 20:05.163
Detective teams are tight-knit
at the best of times,

20:05.288 --> 20:07.582
but I do know this job.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.584
So, I can help

20:09.709 --> 20:11.586
if you let me.

20:11.711 --> 20:12.629
I've gotta go.

20:12.754 --> 20:14.672
It's my wife's birthday
and I'm late.

20:14.797 --> 20:16.466
We'll do this tomorrow.

20:16.591 --> 20:17.592
9 a. m.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.177
Uh-huh.

20:20.345 --> 20:22.055
He takes it personal.

20:22.180 --> 20:23.932
- Well, he shouldn't.
I was assigned.

20:24.057 --> 20:25.099
Not you.

20:25.225 --> 20:26.351
The killings.

20:27.310 --> 20:28.811
That won't last in here.

20:30.521 --> 20:31.606
Plastic.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.524
Thrives in all climates.

21:03.221 --> 21:05.515
Happy birthday to me.

21:05.640 --> 21:07.183
Oh...

21:10.353 --> 21:11.729
I'll take care of that.

21:22.907 --> 21:24.742
I don't even like carnations.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.455
I'm going to bed.

21:35.670 --> 21:37.547
- The previous commandment
prior to Lanning was

21:37.672 --> 21:41.050
"Thou shall not lie."
This is a Catholic family.

21:41.175 --> 21:44.595
Jessica and Steven
were both lawyers.

21:44.721 --> 21:46.180
The Preceptor cut out
both of their tongues

21:46.306 --> 21:48.558
with an electric turkey knife.

21:48.683 --> 21:51.561
Let them bleed out in front of
their own son, Michael.

21:51.686 --> 21:52.812
- What did he do
with the tongues?

21:52.937 --> 21:54.856
- He put them in a blender
and force-fed them to the son,

21:54.981 --> 21:57.108
laced with bleach, of course.

21:57.233 --> 21:58.484
Donut?

21:58.609 --> 22:00.653
- Now why would he feed
the tongues to the son?

22:00.778 --> 22:03.239
- He said they were
feeding lies to everyone,

22:03.364 --> 22:05.074
so he fed their lies
to their son.

22:05.199 --> 22:06.367
How do you guys know all this?

22:06.492 --> 22:07.452
He's quite the letter writer.

22:07.577 --> 22:08.828
We have copies obviously.

22:08.953 --> 22:10.663
I'll get you some.
- Speaking of which...

22:10.788 --> 22:13.875
this came from the ME's office
this morning.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.877
Got it out of Lanning's abdomen.

22:17.920 --> 22:18.713
"The irony of this killing

22:18.838 --> 22:20.798
"is that when people see
what I've done,

22:20.923 --> 22:24.552
"their reaction will be,
'Oh, poor dog, '

22:24.677 --> 22:27.305
"with no consideration
for the vacuous vessel

22:27.430 --> 22:29.098
in which I chose to store it."

22:29.223 --> 22:30.224
Nice.

22:30.350 --> 22:31.225
- Forensics has been
over the letters?

22:31.351 --> 22:34.187
- Local and Langley.
Came out with nothing.

22:34.312 --> 22:36.564
Letter was typed
on an old manual typewriter.

22:36.689 --> 22:37.565
Common ink.

22:37.690 --> 22:42.737
No prints, oils, residue,
glue, particulates. Nothin'.

22:42.862 --> 22:45.406
- The name Preceptor.
That's a Masonic term.

22:45.531 --> 22:46.741
Has that avenue
been checked out?

22:46.866 --> 22:49.202
- It's used by freemasons,
but it's older than that.

22:49.327 --> 22:51.245
A precept is a teacher

22:51.371 --> 22:53.373
responsible to uphold
law or tradition.

22:53.498 --> 22:56.250
In this case,
the Ten Commandments.

22:56.376 --> 22:57.585
- Shall I?
- Just one second.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.879
How many victims are we
talking about in total now?

23:00.004 --> 23:00.838
Fourteen.

23:00.963 --> 23:02.924
- Two commandments left.
- "Thou shall not steal."

23:03.049 --> 23:04.592
"Thou shall not covet."

23:04.717 --> 23:07.220
- Can I ask you what exactly
is your background?

23:07.345 --> 23:08.388
Why are you on this case?

23:08.513 --> 23:10.890
- Of course.
You can ask me anything.

23:11.015 --> 23:13.184
Can we go through the cases in
order, top to bottom?

23:13.309 --> 23:18.272
- You worked forensics two years
before you became a detective.

23:18.398 --> 23:19.399
- Did it take
a lot of detective work

23:19.524 --> 23:20.983
to find out about
another detective?

23:21.109 --> 23:22.860
- Someone higher up think
we're screwin' this up?

23:22.985 --> 23:24.445
- Someone higher up
wants this guy caught,

23:24.570 --> 23:26.697
and it's as simple as that.

23:29.033 --> 23:30.535
Okay. Let's do this.

23:31.702 --> 23:32.870
Okay.

24:05.862 --> 24:07.155
At a point,
we're all

24:07.280 --> 24:08.823
by the word
of his power,

24:08.948 --> 24:11.784
when he has made purification
his

24:11.909 --> 24:15.204
at the right hand
of His Majesty on high.

24:15.329 --> 24:17.039
I am speaking in human terms

24:17.165 --> 24:18.875
because of the weakness
of your flesh,

24:19.000 --> 24:21.377
for just as you presented...

24:21.502 --> 24:24.338
- ...blazed with the impurities
and true lawlessness

24:24.464 --> 24:26.591
resulting in
further lawlessness,

24:26.716 --> 24:30.178
so now present your members
as blazed to righteousness,

24:30.303 --> 24:32.847
resulting in sanctification.

24:45.151 --> 24:46.527
You all right?

24:54.869 --> 24:56.120
Let her go.

25:16.265 --> 25:17.517
Who do you think they are?

25:30.780 --> 25:33.241
- Uniforms are going
door to door to check the CCTVs.

25:49.215 --> 25:50.675
Fuck me!

25:52.552 --> 25:55.179
- Eye for an eye,
tooth for a tooth.

26:14.699 --> 26:18.869
- Tiffany Nardico, age 12,
Emily Cartwright, 13.

26:18.995 --> 26:22.081
Susan Allison, 14,
and Nicole Panna, 15.

26:22.206 --> 26:25.042
They all have records,
but it's just like petty theft.

26:27.545 --> 26:28.462
Okay?

26:28.588 --> 26:29.880
Yeah.

26:32.174 --> 26:33.884
- I just got off the phone
with Hodges.

26:34.844 --> 26:36.554
The medical examiner.

26:36.679 --> 26:37.763
Preliminaries for the hair,
teeth, and eyes

26:37.888 --> 26:39.473
are a match with the hands.

26:39.599 --> 26:41.225
Same with the blood in the jar.

26:41.350 --> 26:43.060
So it's just the four victims.

26:43.185 --> 26:45.229
The killer injected some
kind of epoxy into the hands

26:45.354 --> 26:46.522
to keep them in position.

26:46.647 --> 26:48.733
- Anything else?
- Yes.

26:48.858 --> 26:51.027
No coagulation
in the fingertips.

26:51.152 --> 26:52.403
Shit!

26:52.528 --> 26:53.654
What?

26:53.779 --> 26:55.865
- He cut their hands off
while they were still alive.

26:55.990 --> 26:57.241
Jesus!

26:58.451 --> 26:59.952
- Are those them?
- Yeah.

27:00.077 --> 27:02.538
- What name is that?
- Nicole Panna.

27:02.663 --> 27:05.041
- Hm.
Does that mean anything to you?

27:05.166 --> 27:06.709
- No, why?
Should it?

27:12.006 --> 27:14.342
Carl Watkins.

27:14.467 --> 27:15.885
Who?

27:16.010 --> 27:17.303
Local perp.

27:17.428 --> 27:18.679
Flasher.
Kiddie porn peddler.

27:18.804 --> 27:19.847
We picked him up
a couple times,

27:19.972 --> 27:22.808
but he always pled out
or made a deal informing.

27:22.933 --> 27:24.018
- So what does he
have to do with this?

27:24.143 --> 27:26.103
- All of these girls went to
Chase Terrace Academy.

27:26.228 --> 27:27.688
Terrace put a restraining order
against him

27:27.813 --> 27:29.106
after he was caught
a few times

27:29.231 --> 27:32.526
loitering and jerking off
to the girls in gym class.

27:32.652 --> 27:34.236
That's a real stretch, David.

27:34.362 --> 27:36.447
- Guess who also went to
Terrace a few years back?

27:36.572 --> 27:38.449
Crystal Lanning.

27:38.574 --> 27:39.450
Exactly.

27:39.575 --> 27:41.035
Seriously?

27:41.160 --> 27:43.037
Do we have
a current address on him?

27:45.247 --> 27:46.832
He's not in.

27:46.957 --> 27:49.085
That cocksucker
owes me two months' rent.

27:49.210 --> 27:50.711
He hasn't been here
for a couple of days.

27:50.836 --> 27:52.046
- Think he'd be
hiding out inside?

27:52.171 --> 27:54.882
- If he is, he's freezing
his ass off in the dark.

27:55.007 --> 27:57.218
I cut his power yesterday.

27:59.679 --> 28:00.971
Seriously?

28:01.097 --> 28:02.056
No windows?

28:02.181 --> 28:05.643
- Honey, with what those boys
are doin' in there,

28:05.768 --> 28:07.812
no windows
ain't a bad thing.

28:10.189 --> 28:12.149
Shut the door
when you leave.

28:18.155 --> 28:19.407
What an incredible smell

28:19.532 --> 28:21.575
you've discovered.

28:21.701 --> 28:23.327
Oh, this shouldn't take long.

28:28.708 --> 28:29.583
This guy seems to have

28:29.709 --> 28:32.086
quite the right arm.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.338
Doesn't really seem like
the Preceptor type.

28:35.840 --> 28:37.174
Speak of the devil.

28:48.394 --> 28:51.063
- Looks like it's typed
on an old manual typewriter.

28:51.188 --> 28:52.690
- Let's get that back
to the lab.

28:52.815 --> 28:54.692
- Uh-hm.
- Put out an ATL on Watkins.

28:54.817 --> 28:57.611
In the meantime,
let's hit the usual suspects.

28:57.737 --> 28:59.155
You go with David.

29:10.249 --> 29:11.542
Anything?

29:11.667 --> 29:13.461
Nope.

29:13.586 --> 29:15.129
Done for the day?

29:15.254 --> 29:16.297
Yeah.

29:16.422 --> 29:18.966
I'm going to swing by Watkins'
apartment on the way home.

29:19.091 --> 29:20.468
What's up?

29:20.593 --> 29:22.428
- Somethin's been
buggin' me about it.

29:24.597 --> 29:25.598
Give our regards

29:25.723 --> 29:27.767
to that sweet-mouthed
landlady for me.

29:27.892 --> 29:29.310
I'll give her your number.

29:34.648 --> 29:36.358
- Thanks for turnin'
the power on.

30:52.309 --> 30:54.645
- Excuse me.
Detective Sean Carter.

31:06.532 --> 31:07.867
Mr. Carter.

31:11.370 --> 31:12.121
Mr. Carter.

31:12.246 --> 31:13.956
You're a man
of some interest to us.

31:15.875 --> 31:17.626
What do you want to know?

31:17.751 --> 31:20.462
- Excuse me?
- You obviously have questions.

31:20.588 --> 31:22.089
Why would you say that?

31:22.214 --> 31:24.216
- Because if you wanted me dead,
I'd be dead already.

31:24.341 --> 31:26.093
- That's very true.
What else?

31:28.596 --> 31:31.056
- If I had to guess,
I've stumbled into a painful,

31:31.181 --> 31:32.725
possibly fatal situation,

31:32.850 --> 31:35.561
the agenda of which
you'll soon tell me.

31:35.686 --> 31:36.979
Ha!

31:38.772 --> 31:40.774
- What can you tell me
about Carl Watkins?

31:40.900 --> 31:43.944
- A man of impeccable taste,
apparently.

31:44.069 --> 31:45.738
- What can you tell me
about the Preceptor?

31:45.863 --> 31:48.365
- I was about to ask you
the same question.

31:51.577 --> 31:53.120
What are those?

31:55.289 --> 31:57.124
- Well,
since you've been good enough

31:57.249 --> 31:59.209
not to waste our time
with the usual drudgery

31:59.335 --> 32:03.464
of who are you
and save me, et cetera,

32:03.589 --> 32:06.216
perhaps a reward is in order.

32:14.558 --> 32:17.102
Dear God! Where am I?

32:18.687 --> 32:21.023
- You wanted to know
about these.

32:21.148 --> 32:25.569
They are a linking mechanism
between our world and yours.

32:25.694 --> 32:28.572
They are judgment and redemption
to those who open them.

32:28.697 --> 32:30.866
They are sensation,

32:30.991 --> 32:33.661
rebirth... death,

32:33.786 --> 32:36.372
lust... hate.

32:36.497 --> 32:38.332
All manner of emotions.

32:38.457 --> 32:41.168
They are a conduit
to the unimaginable.

32:45.965 --> 32:48.175
In a wooden box.

32:48.300 --> 32:50.844
- You'd be amazed what
they can do when opened.

32:50.970 --> 32:52.846
What on earth is this place?

32:52.972 --> 32:54.556
It isn't.

32:56.892 --> 32:58.560
So now what?

32:58.686 --> 33:02.314
- This is the beginning of
a process, an interview.

33:02.439 --> 33:03.649
An audit of sorts.

33:03.774 --> 33:04.984
And you want honest answers.

33:05.109 --> 33:06.068
Absolutely.

33:06.193 --> 33:07.653
- So then let's just
get on with it.

33:07.778 --> 33:09.154
Hmmpf.

33:09.279 --> 33:11.907
Tempus fugit after all.

33:12.032 --> 33:16.453
Tell me, when was the first time
you hurt something?

33:16.578 --> 33:18.372
Be honest, Mr. Carter.

33:18.497 --> 33:22.668
The sooner you tell the truth,
the sooner you will be free.

33:22.793 --> 33:24.336
Four.

33:31.385 --> 33:32.636
We had a pet dog.

33:35.431 --> 33:36.598
I hit it.

33:38.058 --> 33:38.976
Should I go on?

33:39.101 --> 33:44.273
March 31, 2004.

33:44.398 --> 33:45.691
I was 25.

33:47.026 --> 33:49.486
The bullet hit him
in the throat.

33:49.611 --> 33:55.826
I saw a fist-size chunk
blown out the back of his neck.

33:55.951 --> 33:58.037
I stood over him
and watched him die.

33:58.162 --> 34:00.414
And after that?

34:00.539 --> 34:02.291
Two kids.

34:02.416 --> 34:03.876
Grenade.

34:04.001 --> 34:07.129
It was the first time I'd ever
seen a body blown to pieces.

34:07.254 --> 34:10.507
Skin stripped from muscle.

34:10.632 --> 34:13.260
Flesh stripped from bone.

34:13.385 --> 34:17.264
- You were a man
protecting his country.

34:17.389 --> 34:20.391
You were permitted to
carry out these acts,

34:20.516 --> 34:24.063
but what were you
permitted to feel?

34:24.188 --> 34:27.900
What did you feel?
- What did I feel?

34:28.025 --> 34:29.275
What the hell
was I supposed to feel?

34:29.400 --> 34:31.945
- You have killed
a great many people.

34:32.071 --> 34:33.197
I was doing my job.

34:33.322 --> 34:34.531
You will purge from yourself

34:34.656 --> 34:37.159
the guilt of shedding
innocent blood.

34:37.284 --> 34:39.953
For you have done what is right
in the eyes of the Lord.

34:40.079 --> 34:42.581
Only God can judge me!

34:42.706 --> 34:44.583
And God will judge
both the righteous man

34:44.708 --> 34:45.626
and the wicked man.

34:45.751 --> 34:47.085
Ecclesiastes 3:17.

34:47.210 --> 34:48.920
Deuteronomy 21:9.

34:49.045 --> 34:50.880
Ha!

34:51.005 --> 34:53.759
I would like to dig
a little deeper.

34:53.884 --> 34:56.512
What choice do I have?

34:56.637 --> 34:57.763
None.

35:04.520 --> 35:07.815
- On my second tour,
the convoy hit, and I...

35:20.619 --> 35:21.578
There are still more.

35:34.800 --> 35:38.428
- "It is a terrible, ponderous
chain you are making, Scrooge."

35:39.972 --> 35:42.516
Charles Dickens.

35:42.641 --> 35:44.393
Now what?

35:44.518 --> 35:46.895
- Next,
you'll meet the assessor,

35:47.020 --> 35:50.440
and my, what a meal
he has ahead of him.

36:02.244 --> 36:04.204
Hmmpf, hmmpf.

36:58.759 --> 37:00.344
What have you done?

37:14.983 --> 37:16.652
- You will be taken
to be cleaned

37:16.777 --> 37:18.403
and then to the surgeon.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.492
Oh. No, it can't be.

37:38.131 --> 37:39.758
I hate this place.

37:39.883 --> 37:41.301
The stench, the dark hole.

37:41.426 --> 37:43.428
The seedy games
and indulgences

37:43.553 --> 37:46.181
we allow you to play
as part of the arrangement.

37:46.306 --> 37:48.809
- Why are you here?
- Let him go.

37:48.934 --> 37:50.185
He has no business here.

37:50.310 --> 37:51.311
I don't understand.

37:51.436 --> 37:54.189
- Well, just because
it falls into your web

37:54.314 --> 37:56.316
does not make it prey
for the spider.

37:56.441 --> 37:58.360
Catch and release.
Do you understand?

37:58.485 --> 37:59.486
What about the assessor?

37:59.611 --> 38:02.197
- Clerical error,
quite literally.

38:02.322 --> 38:03.657
- I've never...
- I don't care!

38:03.782 --> 38:05.534
The jury never passed
their verdict.

38:05.659 --> 38:06.994
You'll let him go,
do you understand?

38:07.119 --> 38:08.120
Not really, no.

38:08.245 --> 38:10.831
- Well, do you understand
who is in charge?

38:12.958 --> 38:14.376
So let him go.

38:16.211 --> 38:18.755
Do not give me a reason
to come back here.

39:27.324 --> 39:32.871
- You must be cleaned
on the inside too!

40:13.620 --> 40:14.871
No!

40:22.212 --> 40:23.964
A moment of your time.

40:24.089 --> 40:25.424
A... a candidate...

40:25.549 --> 40:28.093
I need your assistance
with your... your guidance.

40:28.218 --> 40:29.177
What?

40:29.302 --> 40:32.222
- His answers
choked the assessor.

40:32.347 --> 40:33.890
Forced the jury in.

40:34.015 --> 40:37.769
So... what do you feel?

40:37.894 --> 40:40.230
Innocent?

40:40.355 --> 40:42.065
Where is he now?

40:42.190 --> 40:44.401
I sent him to be cleaned.

41:02.335 --> 41:03.378
He's gone!

41:03.503 --> 41:05.672
Escaped
with one of the boxes.

41:05.797 --> 41:07.424
The pages.

41:13.138 --> 41:14.347
Take.

41:14.473 --> 41:17.434
Eat this in remembrance
of my body.

41:20.479 --> 41:21.897
You must go after him.

41:22.022 --> 41:24.149
Bring him back.
We must dig deeper.

41:24.274 --> 41:26.860
We must find out what you feel
once you've released.

41:30.739 --> 41:33.366
- There's no need
to go after him.

41:33.492 --> 41:35.619
He'll be back.

42:21.706 --> 42:23.750
It's 2:30 in the morning.

42:23.875 --> 42:26.253
- You... you
got your flashlight?

42:26.378 --> 42:28.964
- Yeah, why?
- I'll drive.

42:29.089 --> 42:30.173
Why? What's up?

42:32.092 --> 42:33.009
Huh?

42:33.134 --> 42:34.511
What's going on?

42:50.318 --> 42:51.570
You want to call this in?

42:53.863 --> 42:55.532
What are we doing here?

42:57.242 --> 42:58.451
Hey.

42:58.577 --> 42:59.911
What the fuck
are we doing here?

43:22.809 --> 43:23.935
So?

43:26.187 --> 43:27.731
Come on, man!

43:40.577 --> 43:42.162
Nice. Nice place.

43:43.330 --> 43:45.540
Put an offer in yet?

43:45.665 --> 43:48.001
- Or are you in escrow?
- Fuck.

43:56.426 --> 43:58.178
Hey!

43:58.303 --> 43:59.721
What is going on?

43:59.846 --> 44:01.014
You drag my ass out here

44:01.139 --> 44:03.099
in the middle of the fucking
night with no explanation?

44:04.351 --> 44:06.102
You barely
talk to me anymore, man.

44:07.771 --> 44:09.731
Alison is worried
about you.

44:09.856 --> 44:11.316
Oh, you'd know that.

44:11.441 --> 44:13.693
- Man, we're all worried
about you, Sean.

44:13.818 --> 44:16.071
- I'll drive you back
to your car.

44:42.764 --> 44:46.434
<i>They are a conduit
to the unimaginable.</i>

44:46.559 --> 44:52.190
<i>Sensation, rebirth,
death, lust, hate.</i>

46:17.358 --> 46:18.610
Hey, hey, hey.

46:18.735 --> 46:19.652
It's just a dream.

46:19.778 --> 46:21.488
Just a dream.
You're okay.

46:21.613 --> 46:22.489
It's okay.

46:22.614 --> 46:23.490
- Come here.
Come here.

46:23.615 --> 46:24.491
Sh-h-h-h!

46:26.451 --> 46:27.494
Sh-h-h-h!

46:27.619 --> 46:29.245
It's okay.

46:31.289 --> 46:33.166
I don't know
what's goin' on anymore.

46:35.960 --> 46:39.297
- This case...
it's destroying you.

46:43.384 --> 46:44.594
Sh-h-h-h!

46:44.719 --> 46:46.596
Sh-h-h-h!

47:38.231 --> 47:39.232
Sean!

47:39.357 --> 47:40.108
What?

47:40.233 --> 47:41.901
What is going on?
What are you doing?

47:42.819 --> 47:44.028
What...?

48:26.529 --> 48:27.989
<i>Judgment and redemption</i>

48:28.114 --> 48:30.199
<i>to those who open the box.</i>

48:43.755 --> 48:44.881
Thank you.

48:50.303 --> 48:51.471
Almond milk.

48:51.596 --> 48:53.765
Thanks.

48:58.728 --> 49:00.355
So what's on your mind?

49:00.480 --> 49:02.357
Your brother?

49:02.482 --> 49:04.484
Just curious.

49:04.609 --> 49:09.155
You been here for a couple
of days, what do you see?

49:09.280 --> 49:12.700
- I see two people
mired in a pretty dark case.

49:12.825 --> 49:14.577
One of whom
is probably internalizing

49:14.702 --> 49:16.913
a little bit too much of it.

49:17.038 --> 49:21.209
Honestly, I don't know
that I would be any different.

49:21.334 --> 49:23.336
Yeah, he's not running right.

49:23.461 --> 49:24.921
- Did you talk to
somebody about that?

49:25.046 --> 49:27.715
- Not official,
but I do talk to his wife.

49:27.840 --> 49:29.342
Alison.

49:29.467 --> 49:30.677
Yeah.

49:30.802 --> 49:31.928
How did you know that?

49:32.053 --> 49:35.848
- Did he ever suffer from
any PTSD when he came back?

49:35.974 --> 49:37.475
Not that I know of,

49:37.600 --> 49:40.269
but he's never really talked
about what went on over there.

49:40.395 --> 49:42.438
Drinking, drugs?

49:42.563 --> 49:43.564
None of that?

49:46.234 --> 49:49.821
- He drank for a little while,
but he is sober now.

49:49.946 --> 49:52.198
Just lately he's been distant.

49:52.323 --> 49:54.283
I think maybe it's starting to
have an effect on him.

49:57.662 --> 49:58.538
I...

50:01.791 --> 50:02.667
What?

50:04.711 --> 50:07.338
- Look, I was assigned
to this case for two reasons:

50:07.463 --> 50:09.841
One of them is to expedite
the catching of the Preceptor

50:09.966 --> 50:11.009
and the other is because

50:11.134 --> 50:13.720
there are some concerns
about Sean's behavior.

50:13.845 --> 50:15.221
So, I am here
first and foremost

50:15.346 --> 50:18.099
to help you with the case
but also to evaluate.

50:18.224 --> 50:20.101
- We've been working
our ass off on this case.

50:20.226 --> 50:22.061
And it's not about that!

50:22.186 --> 50:23.855
This is genuine concern
for someone

50:23.980 --> 50:25.356
who might be in too deep.

50:31.571 --> 50:33.239
It's Alison.

50:33.364 --> 50:34.282
Hey, you.

50:36.242 --> 50:37.160
What?

50:38.953 --> 50:40.163
He is?

50:41.748 --> 50:43.750
Don't worry about it.

50:43.875 --> 50:44.709
I'll come by and pick him up.

50:44.834 --> 50:46.711
You take Sara to school.

50:46.836 --> 50:48.254
Okay.

50:48.379 --> 50:50.048
His car broke down.
Have to go pick him up.

50:50.173 --> 50:51.424
He didn't call you?

50:51.549 --> 50:52.425
I gotta go.

51:14.906 --> 51:16.324
Hey.

51:16.449 --> 51:17.366
Hey.

51:17.492 --> 51:18.409
Sean!

51:27.543 --> 51:29.587
- I'll, uh,
I'll go take a shower.

51:29.712 --> 51:31.714
Ah, wait a second, please.

51:36.636 --> 51:38.763
You got to straighten up.

51:38.888 --> 51:43.392
Just in case Egerton has other
motivations for being with us.

51:43.518 --> 51:44.894
Meaning what?

51:45.019 --> 51:47.063
Think about it.

51:47.188 --> 51:49.816
How long have you been
drinking again?

51:49.941 --> 51:51.317
- Alison and I got
in a bit of a fight.

51:51.442 --> 51:53.444
I had a few drinks.
It caught up with me.

51:53.569 --> 51:54.779
I got this.

51:54.904 --> 51:56.239
Go get cleaned up.

51:58.616 --> 51:59.492
Sean...

52:02.787 --> 52:04.705
no one is judging you.

52:05.790 --> 52:09.001
- Like I told somebody else,
only God can judge me.

52:09.127 --> 52:10.169
God will judge
both the righteous man

52:10.294 --> 52:11.629
and the wicked man.

52:39.157 --> 52:40.658
"It was the best of times.

52:40.783 --> 52:43.494
"It was the worst of times."

52:43.619 --> 52:45.454
If I had a relationship
like that...

53:20.865 --> 53:22.116
Hello.

53:22.241 --> 53:23.326
Hey.

53:42.303 --> 53:43.262
Take a look at this.

53:43.387 --> 53:45.556
This is the first letter
from the Preceptor.

53:45.681 --> 53:47.433
Read here.

53:47.558 --> 53:49.268
"There is no accountability.

53:49.393 --> 53:51.938
"I will bring back
the wrath of the Almighty.

53:52.063 --> 53:54.565
"I will be the plague
of retribution.

53:54.690 --> 53:55.816
"It will be
the season of darkness

53:55.942 --> 53:57.026
and winter of despair."

53:57.151 --> 53:58.236
And?

53:58.361 --> 54:00.613
- And I just found this
at Sean's house.

54:00.738 --> 54:02.198
Hmmm, Dickens.

54:02.323 --> 54:03.449
He didn't tell you about this?

54:03.574 --> 54:05.409
- He mentioned the book,
but he didn't mention this.

54:05.534 --> 54:06.494
- Well, maybe he just
put it together.

54:06.619 --> 54:07.620
- Then why didn't
he say anything?

54:07.745 --> 54:09.956
- I don't know.
You should ask him.

54:10.081 --> 54:10.957
Where is he?

54:11.082 --> 54:12.083
He's on his way.

54:12.208 --> 54:14.335
- I thought he had
some kind of car trouble.

54:14.460 --> 54:16.462
He did not have car trouble.

54:16.587 --> 54:18.923
He was drunk,
and I had to go help him.

54:19.048 --> 54:20.174
You said he was sober.

54:20.299 --> 54:21.300
He was. He is.

54:21.425 --> 54:22.551
- David, what the fuck
is going on?

54:22.677 --> 54:23.803
I don't know.

54:23.928 --> 54:25.388
That's why I came to you.

54:25.513 --> 54:26.806
- We're going to
have to talk to him.

54:28.349 --> 54:29.934
Okay.

54:30.059 --> 54:31.060
Talk to who?

54:31.185 --> 54:33.271
- Who or what
happened to your face?

54:33.396 --> 54:35.147
About what?

54:38.067 --> 54:39.277
Hello.

54:39.402 --> 54:40.945
Yes, this is Carter.

54:41.070 --> 54:43.114
Yes. That Carter.

54:43.239 --> 54:45.074
He did.

54:45.199 --> 54:46.450
What exactly?

54:48.160 --> 54:49.036
Phone?

54:49.161 --> 54:50.246
Where?

54:51.956 --> 54:53.457
We'll be there.

54:54.959 --> 54:56.419
Medical examiner.

54:56.544 --> 54:59.255
Found Crystal Lanning's
cell phone.

54:59.380 --> 55:00.673
Wedged down her throat.

55:00.798 --> 55:03.509
- You're kidding me.
- He wants us there.

55:03.634 --> 55:04.552
Okay.

55:04.677 --> 55:05.678
You and I go.

55:05.803 --> 55:08.014
David stays here and goes
through some of that evidence.

55:08.139 --> 55:09.015
Okay.

55:09.140 --> 55:10.266
Okay.

55:19.817 --> 55:21.027
Shit!

55:21.152 --> 55:22.194
Forgot my phone.

55:22.320 --> 55:23.904
Just give me a sec.

55:31.579 --> 55:32.955
Forget your cell phone?

55:34.957 --> 55:36.500
Need you to do me a favor.

55:36.625 --> 55:38.127
Take a quick look around.

55:38.252 --> 55:41.047
See if you find
anything unusual.

55:41.172 --> 55:42.256
- I'm not investigating
my brother.

55:42.381 --> 55:44.091
I'm not asking you to.

55:44.216 --> 55:45.217
Take a look.

55:45.343 --> 55:47.553
For his sake.

55:47.678 --> 55:48.637
Okay.

55:48.763 --> 55:49.764
Okay.

55:58.939 --> 56:00.775
- Well, it seems to be
running okay now.

56:00.900 --> 56:02.193
What?

56:02.318 --> 56:05.738
- The car. David said you had
some car trouble this morning.

56:05.863 --> 56:07.782
Marriage trouble.

56:07.907 --> 56:08.866
Oh.

56:08.991 --> 56:10.493
At least you're honest.

56:15.998 --> 56:17.917
Can I ask you something?

56:18.042 --> 56:19.460
Honestly?

56:19.585 --> 56:21.629
Do you think you're too close
to this case?

56:21.754 --> 56:23.672
Probably, but it's my work.

56:23.798 --> 56:25.925
- Yeah, but if it's tearing
your world apart.

56:26.050 --> 56:27.051
What can I do?

56:27.176 --> 56:28.219
There's only
one commandment left.

56:28.344 --> 56:29.929
Got to finish it all the way
to the end, right?

56:30.054 --> 56:32.598
- I get that, and I think
it's really admirable,

56:32.723 --> 56:35.226
but this is not a tour of duty.

56:35.351 --> 56:36.644
It is for me.

56:42.066 --> 56:44.443
- I was reading through some of
the notes from the Preceptor.

56:44.568 --> 56:48.114
I noticed a lot of the turn
of phrase is very poetic.

56:48.239 --> 56:50.241
Almost reads like literature.

56:50.366 --> 56:52.493
You know, David mentioned
that you read a lot,

56:52.618 --> 56:57.748
so I thought I'd ask if anything
struck a chord with you.

56:57.873 --> 56:58.874
Not really.

57:00.668 --> 57:02.628
I mean, there are
a couple of lines

57:02.753 --> 57:04.755
<i>lifted from A Tale of Two Cities
by Dickens,</i>

57:04.880 --> 57:07.591
but nothing else comes to mind.

57:07.716 --> 57:10.136
- Did you bring that up
in the investigation?

57:10.261 --> 57:11.804
Didn't seem relevant.

57:11.929 --> 57:14.807
After all, it is the most
popular book on the planet.

57:14.932 --> 57:16.058
Oh.

57:17.101 --> 57:18.060
Yeah.

57:20.479 --> 57:21.689
I guess it is.

57:24.150 --> 57:25.067
Hodges.

57:27.778 --> 57:29.655
- Hodges.
- Hey.

57:32.700 --> 57:33.742
See...

57:34.827 --> 57:36.579
yeah.

57:38.497 --> 57:40.166
- I thought you said
you found a cell phone.

57:40.291 --> 57:42.126
- We did.
In her throat.

57:42.251 --> 57:43.836
We found that
in her mouth first.

57:43.961 --> 57:44.837
Silver?

57:44.962 --> 57:46.505
- Born with a silver spoon
in her mouth.

57:46.630 --> 57:48.507
She certainly died that way.

57:48.632 --> 57:51.469
We found this
in her esophagus.

57:51.594 --> 57:54.180
Way down in there.

57:54.305 --> 57:55.347
Damn shame.

57:55.473 --> 57:57.391
- Yeah.
She was only 21.

57:57.516 --> 57:59.560
- Yeah, yeah.
Absolutely.

57:59.685 --> 58:01.270
Nobody has an iPhone 7.

58:01.395 --> 58:02.730
I still got a 4.

58:04.106 --> 58:05.858
- Thanks, Hodges.
Thanks for the information.

58:05.983 --> 58:07.109
It still works.

58:08.611 --> 58:10.571
- What?
- The phone.

58:10.696 --> 58:12.490
Yeah. One of the kids here
has the same model,

58:12.615 --> 58:14.033
so we managed to
power the thing up.

58:14.158 --> 58:16.535
When we did, it turns out
she was using the GPS app.

58:16.660 --> 58:18.245
- The location on it
wasn't her apartment?

58:18.370 --> 58:19.914
No. We checked.

58:20.039 --> 58:22.583
She wasn't killed
in the apartment either.

58:22.708 --> 58:24.585
What he did took time, and uh,

58:24.710 --> 58:26.754
would leave quite the mess.

58:26.879 --> 58:28.631
Yeah, especially with the dog.

58:28.756 --> 58:32.468
No. He took her somewhere alive,
prepped her, killed her.

58:32.593 --> 58:35.679
Luckily, if you can say that,
her phone died with her.

58:35.804 --> 58:37.890
So, it stored
her last location.

58:38.015 --> 58:39.475
- Serial killer
caught by smartphone.

58:39.600 --> 58:42.561
Do you have the address?

58:42.686 --> 58:44.396
- You know, I haven't
seen you around here before.

58:44.522 --> 58:46.899
- Yeah. I was just
assigned to the case.

58:47.024 --> 58:48.025
Single?

58:48.150 --> 58:49.151
You're kidding, right?

59:03.541 --> 59:04.625
I'll call it in.

59:05.834 --> 59:07.086
<i>Yeah. This is
Detective Sean Carter.</i>

59:07.211 --> 59:09.505
<i>We're on the scene of
a possibly compromised location.</i>

59:09.630 --> 59:11.715
<i>Requesting uniform backup.</i>

59:11.840 --> 59:15.052
Address is 12437 Gladstone.

59:15.177 --> 59:18.222
<i>Looks like a disused
warehouse of some kind.</i>

59:19.348 --> 59:20.641
Okay. Copy that.

59:21.684 --> 59:22.935
- I think this is
pretty locked up.

59:24.478 --> 59:26.689
Yeah.

59:26.814 --> 59:27.773
- Guess we'll be waiting.
- I don't know.

59:27.898 --> 59:29.608
I think I hear
a struggle of some kind,

59:29.733 --> 59:31.569
destruction of evidence.

59:33.195 --> 59:34.280
I don't hear anything.

59:34.405 --> 59:35.698
- Well, if you did, we wouldn't
have to wait for a warrant.

59:35.823 --> 59:36.991
You want to catch
this guy, right?

59:37.116 --> 59:38.033
Of course I do.

59:38.158 --> 59:39.243
Then we hear a struggle.

01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:22.244
Over here.

01:01:13.337 --> 01:01:14.171
Look at this.

01:01:22.179 --> 01:01:23.222
It's him.

01:01:59.258 --> 01:02:00.384
Holy shit!

01:02:51.769 --> 01:02:52.895
Drop it!

01:02:56.565 --> 01:02:57.733
Fuck!

01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:03.655
Backup's on the way.

01:03:03.781 --> 01:03:05.365
No, they're not.

01:03:05.491 --> 01:03:07.284
But someone is.

01:03:07.409 --> 01:03:09.495
Now move to the fucking
center of the room.

01:03:15.459 --> 01:03:16.752
How did you find out?

01:03:17.795 --> 01:03:18.879
You told me.

01:03:26.053 --> 01:03:28.430
<i>What was it he said?
"Only God can judge me.</i>

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:31.266
<i>"God will judge the righteous.</i>

01:03:33.143 --> 01:03:34.853
<i>"God will judge
both the righteous man</i>

01:03:34.978 --> 01:03:36.063
<i>and the wicked man."</i>

01:03:40.567 --> 01:03:42.903
<i>"Ecclesiastes is one of
the 24 books of the Tanakh</i>

01:03:43.028 --> 01:03:44.488
<i>"or Hebrew Bible.</i>

01:03:44.613 --> 01:03:47.032
<i>"The title Ecclesiastes
is a Latin transliteration</i>

01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:50.035
<i>"of the Greek translation
originally translated as</i>

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.078
<i>"'teacher'</i>

01:03:51.203 --> 01:03:52.412
"or 'preacher'

01:03:53.914 --> 01:03:55.541
or 'preceptor'."

01:03:56.834 --> 01:03:58.043
Preceptor.

01:04:00.087 --> 01:04:01.129
Shit!

01:04:02.381 --> 01:04:03.298
Shit!

01:04:05.843 --> 01:04:07.135
When I didn't hear back
from Egerton,

01:04:07.261 --> 01:04:09.388
I called Hodges
to get the address.

01:04:09.513 --> 01:04:11.890
Quite the detective.

01:04:12.015 --> 01:04:13.475
Why are you doing this?

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:14.768
Like I've always told you,

01:04:14.893 --> 01:04:17.187
you should read more
starting with the Bible.

01:04:17.312 --> 01:04:18.730
Sean?

01:04:18.856 --> 01:04:20.607
- You wouldn't call backup
on your own brother.

01:04:20.732 --> 01:04:21.733
Not until you knew for sure.

01:04:21.859 --> 01:04:23.944
So, I called someone else.

01:04:25.487 --> 01:04:26.697
In here.

01:04:29.032 --> 01:04:31.410
I came as fast as I could.

01:04:31.535 --> 01:04:32.828
Shit!

01:04:34.997 --> 01:04:36.832
Sean, what are you doing?

01:04:38.542 --> 01:04:39.501
Sean?

01:04:41.003 --> 01:04:42.754
What is this?
What's going on?

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:43.881
Come on in, sweetheart.

01:04:44.006 --> 01:04:46.008
Come stand
next to my dear brother.

01:04:47.718 --> 01:04:49.845
No, no.

01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:52.180
Go stand next to David.

01:04:55.726 --> 01:04:57.769
I didn't say touch her!

01:05:00.397 --> 01:05:04.860
- I have so much more
planned for the two of you.

01:05:04.985 --> 01:05:07.863
That Lanning bitch's cell phone
fucked things up!

01:05:07.988 --> 01:05:09.031
I don't understand.

01:05:10.532 --> 01:05:12.200
You don't?

01:05:12.326 --> 01:05:13.660
Look around.

01:05:13.785 --> 01:05:14.995
Look at what I've done.

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:18.707
This is the love of God
that we keep his commandments,

01:05:18.832 --> 01:05:21.627
and his commandments
are not burdensome.

01:05:21.752 --> 01:05:23.337
Where is Egerton?

01:05:26.924 --> 01:05:28.508
Oh!

01:05:28.634 --> 01:05:29.635
Jesus Christ!

01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:36.058
Sean, no, no.

01:05:36.183 --> 01:05:38.185
Wait, wait. We... we...

01:05:42.147 --> 01:05:48.362
- This whore cheated on me
with some guy she met online

01:05:48.487 --> 01:05:51.823
two weeks after I left
for my first tour.

01:05:51.949 --> 01:05:52.991
I'm sorry.

01:05:53.116 --> 01:05:55.953
- Thou shall not covet
another man's wife.

01:05:58.163 --> 01:05:59.122
So I cut his eyelids off

01:05:59.247 --> 01:06:01.667
and burned him alive
in his own car.

01:06:02.876 --> 01:06:09.299
I wasn't surprised with her,
but I expected more of you.

01:06:09.424 --> 01:06:10.300
Sean, I am...

01:06:10.425 --> 01:06:14.721
- A plague of
smartphone junkies.

01:06:14.846 --> 01:06:19.685
I... loathe the modern world.

01:06:19.810 --> 01:06:22.145
I loathe the populace.

01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:26.149
If I had the means and ways,
I would incinerate them all.

01:06:26.274 --> 01:06:29.653
Rain down fire
and sulphur.

01:06:32.864 --> 01:06:34.032
Now.

01:06:34.157 --> 01:06:37.369
I want you to sit down
in front of each other.

01:06:38.704 --> 01:06:40.038
Just do it!

01:06:41.123 --> 01:06:41.915
What are you going to do?

01:06:49.047 --> 01:06:50.799
Open that.

01:06:50.924 --> 01:06:52.050
What?

01:06:52.175 --> 01:06:53.593
What the fuck is this?

01:06:53.719 --> 01:06:54.678
- Open it.
Both of you.

01:06:54.803 --> 01:06:56.263
Now. Together.

01:07:17.159 --> 01:07:18.660
- What is this?
What's happening?

01:07:24.666 --> 01:07:25.667
Judgment!

01:07:32.883 --> 01:07:36.303
I knew you would
find your way here eventually.

01:07:43.435 --> 01:07:44.728
After all...

01:07:49.107 --> 01:07:51.443
evil seeks evil.

01:07:56.239 --> 01:07:58.784
- I knew someone
would come for me.

01:07:58.909 --> 01:08:00.452
So, I thought
I'd save you the time

01:08:00.577 --> 01:08:01.870
and offer you a deal.

01:08:01.995 --> 01:08:05.332
- There is no deal
to be made.

01:08:05.457 --> 01:08:06.958
Them for me.

01:08:07.084 --> 01:08:08.126
Adulterers.

01:08:08.251 --> 01:08:09.377
They opened the box.

01:08:09.503 --> 01:08:11.463
- And they will be
dealt with accordingly.

01:08:12.631 --> 01:08:15.008
It is a separate faction
who has want of you,

01:08:15.133 --> 01:08:17.803
and there is no bargaining
to be done.

01:08:17.928 --> 01:08:19.513
Ah, Mr. Carter.

01:08:19.638 --> 01:08:21.555
So good to see you again.

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:22.640
And you brought friends.

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:24.684
- I brought them
to trade for me.

01:08:24.810 --> 01:08:26.645
That is not how it works.

01:08:30.899 --> 01:08:32.526
- I won't go back
in that room.

01:08:37.781 --> 01:08:41.785
- Mr. Carter, please.
That won't work for you now.

01:08:42.911 --> 01:08:43.787
Mr. Carter.

01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:58.009
You have been found guilty

01:08:58.135 --> 01:08:59.261
by the jury.

01:09:00.303 --> 01:09:03.305
You'll be taken to be
cleaned... again.

01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:05.767
And then to the Surgeon.

01:09:05.892 --> 01:09:07.269
Not me!

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:13.358
- The pages of your audit
were so rancid

01:09:13.483 --> 01:09:14.818
with the essence
of your guilt,

01:09:14.943 --> 01:09:18.654
they made
even the Assessor choke.

01:09:18.779 --> 01:09:21.366
When the Surgeon and the Butcher
are finished with you,

01:09:21.491 --> 01:09:25.787
you will be reborn
into an eternity of agony.

01:09:25.912 --> 01:09:27.037
What the fuck is going on?

01:09:27.163 --> 01:09:28.206
Silence!

01:09:28.331 --> 01:09:30.959
Your pitiful adultery
is beneath me.

01:09:31.084 --> 01:09:35.546
Bow your head to the catalog of
filth your brother has created.

01:10:02.699 --> 01:10:04.576
Amateurs.

01:10:04.701 --> 01:10:07.412
But still we will afford them
an experience

01:10:07.537 --> 01:10:10.332
beyond the limits
in your name.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.710
Get away from him.

01:10:22.219 --> 01:10:25.931
- How do you feel,
Eden's doorman?

01:10:26.056 --> 01:10:27.182
Once upon a time.

01:10:27.307 --> 01:10:28.767
And then what was it?

01:10:28.892 --> 01:10:33.563
Watching over the ark-builder's
incestuous offspring until now.

01:10:33.688 --> 01:10:36.274
- I want to turn
this basement into misfits.

01:10:36.399 --> 01:10:37.901
He was found guilty.

01:10:38.026 --> 01:10:39.444
Let him go!

01:10:39.569 --> 01:10:42.113
There are matters at play here
that are part of a bigger plan.

01:10:42.239 --> 01:10:44.282
And he is a part of it.

01:10:44.407 --> 01:10:47.452
- You want him now
to remain on Earth...

01:10:47.577 --> 01:10:50.497
or rather He wants him
out of there.

01:10:50.622 --> 01:10:52.582
He wants his flock
afraid of the horse

01:10:52.707 --> 01:10:55.168
so that they look
toward the light.

01:10:55.293 --> 01:10:57.671
- You're not as foolish
as you look.

01:10:57.796 --> 01:10:59.297
- But what about the things
he has done,

01:10:59.422 --> 01:11:01.299
the innocents he has killed?

01:11:01.424 --> 01:11:03.385
Acceptable losses.

01:11:04.970 --> 01:11:07.806
Good cannot exist without evil.

01:11:07.931 --> 01:11:11.434
And we discovered long ago that
in order to control the evil,

01:11:11.559 --> 01:11:14.020
we had to be the ones
implementing it.

01:11:14.145 --> 01:11:16.648
Sin ordained by Heaven.

01:11:20.652 --> 01:11:21.987
Send him back.

01:11:26.116 --> 01:11:28.451
- Continue with your work,
Preceptor.

01:11:29.995 --> 01:11:31.913
With our blessing.

01:11:33.748 --> 01:11:36.126
- And the Lord saw
that the sin of man

01:11:36.251 --> 01:11:38.628
was great on the Earth,

01:11:38.753 --> 01:11:41.339
and that all the thoughts
of his heart were evil.

01:11:42.465 --> 01:11:44.342
There is process...

01:11:44.467 --> 01:11:45.844
order to what we do.

01:11:45.969 --> 01:11:48.013
Send him back!

01:11:48.138 --> 01:11:49.848
Or?

01:11:51.266 --> 01:11:53.268
There will be hell to pay.

01:11:53.393 --> 01:11:56.896
Hell... to... pay.

01:11:57.022 --> 01:11:58.440
Don't test me!

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:04.738
Very well.

01:12:11.411 --> 01:12:13.872
Now get me
the fuck outta here!

01:12:13.997 --> 01:12:14.873
I've been forgiven.

01:12:14.998 --> 01:12:17.375
Not forgiven.

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.586
- What?
- You're a murderer!

01:12:19.711 --> 01:12:21.087
A twisted sadist.

01:12:21.212 --> 01:12:23.214
For now, your actions
work in our favor.

01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:26.801
But there will be judgment
for you eventually.

01:12:26.926 --> 01:12:29.137
And, we will be waiting.

01:12:29.262 --> 01:12:30.263
Fuck you!

01:12:34.559 --> 01:12:35.977
Now send him back.

01:12:37.062 --> 01:12:37.979
With pleasure.

01:12:46.696 --> 01:12:47.572
I'm back.

01:12:59.292 --> 01:13:01.378
"Tis a far, far..."

01:13:12.722 --> 01:13:18.061
We have an officer down
at 12437 Gladstone.

01:13:18.186 --> 01:13:19.729
Send assistance.

01:13:19.854 --> 01:13:21.940
This is Egerton.

01:13:22.065 --> 01:13:23.775
We have the Preceptor.

01:13:24.734 --> 01:13:26.903
Get me a fucking ambulance!

01:13:28.071 --> 01:13:30.782
You knew that would happen.

01:13:30.907 --> 01:13:32.951
- You know nothing
of human behavior.

01:13:34.744 --> 01:13:37.372
<i>There will be retaliation.</i>

01:13:37.497 --> 01:13:40.041
<i>You will suffer.</i>

01:13:41.251 --> 01:13:42.377
Suffer?

01:13:44.754 --> 01:13:45.713
Me?

01:13:50.427 --> 01:13:53.471
How dare you use such a word?

01:13:53.596 --> 01:13:55.598
You know nothing of suffering.

01:13:55.723 --> 01:13:58.059
I welcome its warm embrace.

01:13:58.184 --> 01:14:01.229
I exist only to
share its meaning.

01:14:01.354 --> 01:14:05.650
Sin and suffering
are my dominion.

01:14:05.775 --> 01:14:07.735
Perhaps it's time
you learned a little

01:14:07.861 --> 01:14:10.029
of the matters
you seek to manage.

01:14:16.119 --> 01:14:17.328
What are you doing?

01:14:17.454 --> 01:14:20.665
Do you know who I am?

01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:21.958
I care not.

01:14:25.253 --> 01:14:27.714
Irony.

01:14:52.614 --> 01:14:54.616
Are you the way?

01:14:58.286 --> 01:15:00.830
Do your worst!

01:15:00.955 --> 01:15:06.002
You forget
my first tasks for Him.

01:15:06.127 --> 01:15:09.339
And my order
has already been sanctioned.

01:15:09.464 --> 01:15:10.548
Look at me.

01:15:11.883 --> 01:15:13.635
I'm all you know.

01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:17.096
Forged in agony and pain.

01:15:17.222 --> 01:15:19.933
I welcome
the eternity of anguish.

01:15:20.058 --> 01:15:22.477
So, Pinhead...

01:15:37.116 --> 01:15:39.202
Here endeth the lesson.

01:15:40.495 --> 01:15:43.039
Jesus wept!

01:16:02.934 --> 01:16:05.603
- Probably should not
have done that.

01:16:05.728 --> 01:16:07.855
I have nothing to fear.

01:16:07.981 --> 01:16:09.190
Did you forget?

01:16:09.315 --> 01:16:12.652
She is the angel who banished
them from the Garden of Eden.

01:16:12.777 --> 01:16:16.864
Perhaps there is a torture
we cannot endure.

01:16:16.990 --> 01:16:18.533
Banishment.

01:16:24.372 --> 01:16:25.248
<i>Banishment.</i>

01:16:26.374 --> 01:16:27.584
<i>Exile.</i>

01:16:27.709 --> 01:16:29.794
<i>Back to the mortal world.</i>

01:16:31.379 --> 01:16:32.255
<i>Banishment.</i>

01:16:42.098 --> 01:16:44.142
Sweet suffering.

01:16:44.267 --> 01:16:45.602
The sweet suffering.

01:16:48.146 --> 01:16:51.065
No!

01:16:56.654 --> 01:16:59.240
No!

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:47.260
- Two, and it isn't even
a Tuesday.
