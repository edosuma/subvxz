EPISODE OF <i> INK MASTER...</i>

00:04.337 --> 00:09.134
EIGHT RIVAL ARTISTS WERE
FIGHTING TO SETTLE THE SCORE.

00:09.217 --> 00:10.927
IN THE FLASH CHALLENGE,

00:11.010 --> 00:12.762
THE ARTISTS FACE A WHOLE NEW SET
OF PROBLEMS

00:12.846 --> 00:16.474
TATTOOING AMPUTEES.

00:16.558 --> 00:17.934
- ALL RIGHT?
- YEAH, SORRY.

00:18.017 --> 00:19.310
I CAN'T CONTROL
THAT TWITCHING.

00:19.394 --> 00:20.395
- MY CANVAS' RESIDUAL LIMB IS

00:20.478 --> 00:23.148
LITERALLY BOUNCING OFF
OF THE TABLE.

00:23.231 --> 00:25.817
announcer:
IN THE ELIMINATION TATTOO,

00:25.900 --> 00:29.320
RIVALS WENT HEAD-TO-HEAD
TO SETTLE THE SCORE.

00:29.404 --> 00:30.613
- THIS KIND OF CURVES
A LITTLE BIT,

00:30.697 --> 00:31.781
BUT IT SITS RIGHT ON HER BONES.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.324
- WOW.
- I'M GONNA SHUT DON UP

00:33.408 --> 00:35.827
ONCE AND FOR ALL,
AND I'M GONNA SEND HIS ASS HOME.

00:35.910 --> 00:39.038
announcer: AND THE ARTISTS
MADE A SHOCKING DISCOVERY.

00:39.122 --> 00:40.290
- EVERYBODY'S GOT A PROBLEM.

00:40.373 --> 00:43.084
JOSH HAS BEEN
CHEATING THE COMPETITION.

00:43.168 --> 00:45.044
- YOU'RE A [bleep] LIAR.
YOU'RE A [bleep] CHEAT.

00:45.128 --> 00:46.796
- YOU'RE GONNA CHEAT, PAY
THE [bleep] PRICE OR GO HOME.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.840
- YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR MIND.

00:48.923 --> 00:50.383
- I CAN'T HELP YOU ANYMORE.

00:50.467 --> 00:52.093
- I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP,
AND I NEVER DID.

00:52.177 --> 00:54.345
- I HELPED YOU BY NOT BEATING
YOUR [bleep] HEAD IN THE WALL.

00:54.429 --> 00:55.972
announcer: IN THE ELIMINATION,

00:56.055 --> 00:58.683
CRIS, MARK, DON, AND JASON

00:58.767 --> 01:00.226
WERE IN THE BOTTOM FOUR.

01:00.310 --> 01:03.271
- ANY ONE OF YOU COULD BE
JUSTIFIABLY ELIMINATED.

01:03.354 --> 01:07.317
HOWEVER, THERE IS A SITUATION
THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS.

01:07.400 --> 01:11.362
JOSH, YOU VIOLATED MULTIPLE
RULES OF THIS COMPETITION.

01:11.446 --> 01:12.781
AND AS YOU ADMITTED,

01:12.864 --> 01:14.157
YOU'VE BEEN IN POSSESSION
OF CONTRABAND.

01:14.240 --> 01:14.908
- I JUST WANT TO DO
THE COMPETITION, MAN.

01:14.991 --> 01:17.118
I DIDN'T DO IT TO CHEAT.

01:17.202 --> 01:18.286
- I MEAN, IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE.

01:18.369 --> 01:19.454
IT'S PRETTY CLEAR-CUT.

01:19.537 --> 01:21.831
- THIS IS A SERIOUS RULES
VIOLATION.

01:21.915 --> 01:26.503
THEREFORE, YOU ARE OUT
OF THE COMPETITION.

01:26.586 --> 01:27.962
- TODAY IS THE FIRST TIME EVER

01:28.046 --> 01:29.798
THAT THE BEST TATTOO OF THE DAY

01:29.881 --> 01:31.090
GOES HOME.

01:31.174 --> 01:32.467
- SORRY.

01:32.550 --> 01:35.136
- JOSH, YOU DO NOT HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE INK MASTER.

01:41.810 --> 01:43.186
announcer: SEVEN ARTISTS REMAIN,

01:43.269 --> 01:47.524
BUT ONLY ONE WILL EARN
A $100,000 PRIZE

[rock music]

{\an8}♪ ♪

02:47.333 --> 02:48.918
- THAT WAS A TERRIBLE WAY
TO GO OUT.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.254
- JOSH--HE DID IT TO HIMSELF.

02:51.337 --> 02:53.089
AND EVERYBODY CREATES
THEIR OWN DESTINY, MAN.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.549
HE JUST MADE POOR CHOICES.

02:54.632 --> 02:57.135
- WHAT DO YOU THINK'S GONNA
HAPPEN RIGHT NOW?

02:57.218 --> 02:58.928
THE COMPETITION MOVES ON.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.222
- WE'RE HERE TO TATTOO.
- IT IS A COMPETITION.

03:01.306 --> 03:02.682
YOU GOT TO FIGHT
WITH WHO'S RIGHT HERE, DUDE.

03:02.765 --> 03:05.768
WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO THINK
ABOUT [bleep] FROM YESTERDAY

03:05.852 --> 03:06.936

I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU, YOU,
YOU, YOU--

EVERYBODY IS AT EACH OTHER NOW.

- WOW.

03:27.498 --> 03:28.499
HOLY [bleep].

03:31.878 --> 03:33.087
- WELCOME, ARTISTS.

03:33.171 --> 03:36.299
ALL SEVEN OF YOU FOUGHT HARD
TO MAKE IT THIS FAR,

03:36.382 --> 03:39.135
BUT ONLY ONE OF YOU WILL WALK

A FEATURE IN <i> INKED</i> MAGAZINE,

03:43.306 --> 03:44.641
THIS WEEK,

03:44.724 --> 03:46.976
WE'RE TESTING...

03:47.060 --> 03:48.269
PLACEMENT.

03:48.353 --> 03:50.813
{\an8}- PROPERLY PLACING A TATTOO CAN
REALLY CHANGE THE DYNAMIC

03:50.897 --> 03:52.273
{\an8}OF THE ENTIRE PIECE.

03:52.357 --> 03:55.318
IF YOU PUT A BEAUTIFUL TATTOO
ON A PERFECT SPOT IN THE BODY,

03:55.401 --> 03:56.653
IT MAKES IT THAT MUCH BETTER.

03:56.736 --> 04:00.156
- TODAY WE HAVE A VERY SPECIAL
GUEST JUDGE,

04:00.239 --> 04:05.078
RUNNING BACK FOR THE CAROLINA
PANTHERS, DEANGELO WILLIAMS.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.205
- YEAH.

04:07.288 --> 04:09.165
{\an8}- DEANGELO WILLIAMS--
MAN, THIS IS SUPER EXCITING.

04:09.248 --> 04:12.418
{\an8}- THIS IS AWESOME.
I'M A HUGE FOOTBALL FAN.

04:12.502 --> 04:14.045
{\an8}- WHAT'S GOING ON, MAN?

04:14.128 --> 04:16.005
{\an8}I GOT MY FIRST TATTOO
WHEN I WAS 19.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.839
EVERY TATTOO THAT I HAVE
REPRESENTS

04:17.923 --> 04:19.550
SOMETHING THAT'S HAPPENED
IN MY LIFE.

04:19.634 --> 04:20.843
HEY, GUYS.
all: HEY.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.262
- AS A GUEST JUDGE,

04:22.345 --> 04:25.848
I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEONE THAT CAN
TURN THOUGHTS AND MOMENTS

04:25.932 --> 04:28.851
INTO ARTWORK THAT THEY CAN WEAR
FOR A LIFETIME.

04:28.935 --> 04:31.938
- WHILE DEANGELO'S BEST KNOWN
FOR HIS SPEED ON THE FIELD,

04:32.021 --> 04:32.939
OFF THE FIELD,

04:33.022 --> 04:35.024
HE FIGHTS TIRELESSLY
FOR A CAUSE

04:35.108 --> 04:36.734
THAT HAS BECOME PERSONAL

04:36.818 --> 04:38.027
FOR HIM AND HIS FAMILY.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.405
WHAT YOU MAY NOT KNOW
IS THAT DEANGELO

04:40.488 --> 04:43.324
IS LARGELY CREDITED
FOR CONVINCING THE NFL

04:43.408 --> 04:46.786
TO LET ALL PLAYERS WEAR PINK
DURING THE MONTH OF OCTOBER

04:46.869 --> 04:48.246
FOR BREAST CANCER AWARENESS.

04:48.329 --> 04:49.372
- THAT'S AWESOME.

04:49.455 --> 04:51.666
- MY GRANDFATHER HAD
FIVE DAUGHTERS.

04:51.749 --> 04:53.960
ALL FIVE OF THOSE DAUGHTERS DIED
OF BREAST CANCER,

04:54.043 --> 04:55.044
INCLUDING MY MOM.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.170
- WOW.

04:56.254 --> 04:59.173
- BREAST CANCER HAS AFFECTED ME
TO MY CORE.

04:59.257 --> 05:02.844
AND I'LL NEVER FORGET THE LOSS
OF FAMILY MEMBERS,

05:02.927 --> 05:07.390
BUT IT ALSO ALLOWED ME
TO USE A PLATFORM THAT I HAVE

05:07.473 --> 05:09.100
IN THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE

05:09.183 --> 05:11.477
TO BRING AWARENESS
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.146
BREAST CANCER PICKED A FIGHT
WITH A FAMILY

05:13.229 --> 05:15.606
THAT'S WILLING TO FIGHT BACK.

05:15.690 --> 05:16.607
- FOR TODAY'S FLASH CHALLENGE,

05:16.691 --> 05:19.736
YOU MUST DESIGN A TATTOO
FOR DEANGELO

05:19.819 --> 05:21.112
IN HONOR OF HIS FAMILY.

05:21.195 --> 05:22.905
HERE'S THE CATCH:

05:22.989 --> 05:26.909
DEANGELO WANTS HIS TATTOO DRAWN
DIRECTLY ON THE SKIN

05:26.993 --> 05:30.580
WITHOUT USING A STENCIL.

05:30.663 --> 05:32.874
{\an8}- FREEHANDING IS THE BEST WAY
TO GET THE PLACEMENT PERFECT

05:32.957 --> 05:33.916
{\an8}WITH YOUR CANVAS.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.418
{\an8}THAT WAY, IT'LL FLOW
WITH THE BODY

05:35.501 --> 05:37.253
{\an8}AND WILL LOOK AS NATURAL
AS POSSIBLE.

05:37.336 --> 05:39.422
- YOU WILL BE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED
A BODY DOUBLE CANVAS.

05:39.505 --> 05:43.760
YOU MUST FREEHAND
A CUSTOM DESIGN FOR DEANGELO

05:43.843 --> 05:47.638
ON YOUR BODY DOUBLE
DEMONSTRATING PERFECT PLACEMENT.

05:47.722 --> 05:49.599
IF DEANGELO SELECTS
ONE OF YOUR DESIGNS,

05:49.682 --> 05:51.851
THAT ARTIST WILL THEN
FREEHAND IT DIRECTLY

05:51.934 --> 05:53.394
ONTO DEANGELO'S SKIN.

05:53.478 --> 05:54.771
AT THAT POINT,

05:54.854 --> 05:56.147
DEANGELO WILL HAVE TO DECIDE
IF HE WANTS THE DESIGN

05:56.230 --> 05:59.859
PERMANENTLY TATTOOED
OR NOT.

05:59.942 --> 06:01.277
IF NONE OF YOU NAIL IT

06:01.360 --> 06:02.612
AND NO ONE TATTOOS DEANGELO,

06:02.695 --> 06:05.323
THERE WILL BE NO WINNER
FOR THIS FLASH CHALLENGE.

06:05.406 --> 06:08.117
- I GOT A LOT OF PRESSURE
RIGHT NOW.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.452
IF DEANGELO PICKS MY DESIGN,

06:09.535 --> 06:10.828
BUT THEN DOESN'T LET ME TATTOO
HIM,

06:10.912 --> 06:12.497
THAT WOULD SUCK.

06:12.580 --> 06:15.625
- YOU HAVE 30 MINUTES TO CONSULT
WITH DEANGELO AS A GROUP.

06:15.708 --> 06:17.960
THEN YOU WILL HAVE ONE HOUR
TO FREEHAND YOUR DESIGN

06:18.044 --> 06:20.797
ONTO YOUR BODY DOUBLE.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.674
AND YOUR TIME STARTS...

06:23.758 --> 06:27.970
NOW.

06:28.054 --> 06:30.473
{\an8}- TODAY I WANT THE ARTIST
TO DRAW DIRECTLY ON ME

06:30.556 --> 06:33.351
{\an8}BECAUSE I'LL KNOW THAT THE PIECE
IS JUST FOR ME.

06:33.434 --> 06:36.062
IT'D TAKE A REAL ARTIST
TO JUST SAY,

06:36.145 --> 06:37.522
"HEY, I DON'T NEED A STENCIL.

06:37.605 --> 06:39.899
"I'M JUST GONNA GO
WITH MY VISION OF YOUR STORY

06:39.982 --> 06:41.400
AND GIVE YOU SOMETHING."

06:41.484 --> 06:44.403
WHAT UP, GUYS?
- WHAT'S GOING ON, MAN?

06:44.487 --> 06:46.030
- SO JUST GIVING YOU
A BACKGROUND,

06:46.114 --> 06:48.491
MY MOM DIED ON THE 16TH OF MAY.

06:48.574 --> 06:51.410
SHE WAS DEFINITELY A WARRIOR
FOR THIS DISEASE

06:51.494 --> 06:52.662
AND A FIGHTER.

06:52.745 --> 06:54.539
I KIND OF WANT SOMETHING
THAT ENTAILS THAT STORY.

06:54.622 --> 06:56.499
- DID YOU HAVE ANY VISION
IN YOUR HEAD?

06:56.582 --> 06:59.127
AT LEAST WE HAVE A DIRECTION
TO GO OFF OF?

06:59.210 --> 07:00.795
- I'M LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
UNIQUE.

07:00.878 --> 07:02.296
WHEN I SEE IT,
THAT'S IT.

07:02.380 --> 07:03.589
THAT'S WHAT I CAME HERE FOR.

07:03.673 --> 07:04.715
- WELL, THANKS FOR MAKING IT
EASY ON US.

07:04.799 --> 07:06.717
{\an8}- DEANGELO'S BEING VERY VAGUE
RIGHT NOW.

07:06.801 --> 07:09.387
{\an8}BUT SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T COME
TO YOU WITH AN EXACT IDEA

07:09.470 --> 07:12.265
{\an8}OF WHAT THEY WANT,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:12.348 --> 07:15.059
IT'S MY JOB AS AN ARTIST
TO LEAD THEM DOWN A PATH

07:15.143 --> 07:16.602
THAT'S GONNA GIVE THEM
A GREAT TATTOO.

07:16.686 --> 07:17.520
- YOU MAKE IT FROM YOUR HEART.

07:17.603 --> 07:19.188
IT'LL TRANSLATE OVER TO MINE.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.357
- AWESOME.
- ALL RIGHT.

07:21.440 --> 07:22.483
GOOD LUCK.

07:22.567 --> 07:26.195
{\an8}- DEANGELO HAS A VERY EMOTIONAL,
PERSONAL STORY

07:26.279 --> 07:27.905
{\an8}ABOUT WHAT HE WANTS
HIS TATTOO TO BE.

07:27.989 --> 07:29.657
THESE ARTISTS HAVE A LOT
OF PRESSURE ON THEM.

07:29.740 --> 07:32.160
THEY NEED TO PAY ATTENTION
TO PLACEMENT,

07:32.243 --> 07:33.452
DRAW IT ON THE SPOT,

07:33.536 --> 07:35.204
AND MAKE IT FLOW
WITH THE BODY REALLY NICE.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.372
- AARON.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

07:36.455 --> 07:38.416
{\an8}- I'M GONNA KEEP THIS SIMPLE,

07:38.499 --> 07:41.085
{\an8}READABLE, AND SUPER EASY
TO UNDERSTAND.

07:41.169 --> 07:41.919
- WHAT WE GOT GOING ON TODAY?

07:42.003 --> 07:43.754
- A SIMPLISTIC FLOWER DESIGN--

07:43.838 --> 07:45.047
THINKING OF THE ROSE KIND
OF LIKE--

07:45.131 --> 07:46.424
A FEW PETALS HAVE FALLEN OFF.

07:46.507 --> 07:47.967
BUT THE FLOWER'S STILL ALIVE
AND STRONG.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.889
{\an8}- AARON'S DOING ANOTHER ROSE
YET AGAIN.

07:52.972 --> 07:55.975
I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE THINKS
THAT HE CAN DO GOOD ROSES,

07:56.058 --> 07:58.227
BECAUSE HE GETS RIPPED APART
EACH ROSE THAT HE DOES.

08:03.816 --> 08:05.693
- I ADAPT TO ANY SITUATION.

08:05.776 --> 08:07.737
I GET THAT EVERY CHALLENGE
IS NOT MY FORTE,

08:07.820 --> 08:09.155
BUT I'M STILL GOOD AT IT.

08:09.238 --> 08:12.158
{\an8}THIS FREEHAND CHALLENGE IS GONNA
SEPARATE THE MEN FROM THE BOYS.

08:12.241 --> 08:14.410
SOME OF THESE GUYS COULDN'T DRAW
TO SAVE THEIR LIVES.

08:14.493 --> 08:16.037
HE'S GONNA COME OVER,
AND HE'LL BE LIKE,

08:16.120 --> 08:17.455
"OH, THAT'S AWESOME."

08:17.538 --> 08:20.124
NOTHING CAN STOP ME.
I'M TAKING THIS TO THE END.

08:20.208 --> 08:24.629
- YOU HAVE 45 MINUTES.

08:24.712 --> 08:27.423
- YOU CAN DO SO MUCH MORE
THAN JUST WRITE SOMEBODY'S NAME.

08:27.506 --> 08:28.841
YOU CAN DO SOMETHING
THAT'S SYMBOLIC.

08:28.925 --> 08:31.177
{\an8}I HAVE TO MAKE THIS DESIGN FLOW
PERFECTLY ON DEANGELO'S BODY

08:31.260 --> 08:33.261
{\an8}BECAUSE IF I DON'T,

08:33.346 --> 08:34.597
{\an8}I'M NOT GONNA BE TATTOOING
TODAY.

08:34.679 --> 08:36.265
I NEED TO WIN THIS FLASH
CHALLENGE

08:36.349 --> 08:37.600
BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY
SEVEN OF US LEFT,

08:37.683 --> 08:38.808
AND WHATEVER ADVANTAGE I CAN
GAIN, I WANT.

08:38.893 --> 08:41.062
A KOI FISH SWIMS UPSTREAM
AGAINST THE CURRENT.

08:41.145 --> 08:43.688
IT'S ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL
SYMBOLS IN JAPANESE TATTOOING.

08:48.319 --> 08:50.029
- I ALWAYS THOUGHT
WINGS ARE STRONG

08:50.112 --> 08:52.031
AND THEN, LIKE, HE'S
THE STRENGTH OF THE FAMILY.

08:52.114 --> 08:53.824
SO I THINK THAT'S
A PRETTY COOL IDEA.

08:53.908 --> 08:56.077
{\an8}LAST WEEK, I WAS IN THE BOTTOM
IN THIS COMPETITION.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.411
I'M GOING BIG AND BOLD

08:57.495 --> 08:59.455
BECAUSE I KNOW I NEED TO GET
BACK IN THIS GAME.

08:59.538 --> 09:00.831
- 15 MINUTES REMAIN.

09:03.876 --> 09:05.419
- ALREADY SWEATING
ON YOUR CANVAS?

09:05.503 --> 09:07.797
- YEAH, I TRY NOT TO.
THAT'S RUDE AND DISGUSTING.

09:07.880 --> 09:09.382
- I'M DRIPPING RIGHT ON HIM.

09:09.465 --> 09:11.133
{\an8}DRAWING DIRECTLY ON MY CANVAS
IN THIS KIND OF HEAT

09:11.217 --> 09:12.426
{\an8}JUST MAKES ME FEEL AT HOME.

09:12.510 --> 09:14.303
FOR ME, IT'S JUST ANOTHER DAY
AT THE BEACH.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.013
YOU KNOW, IT'S THIS KIND OF
POLYNESIAN TRIBAL ON THAT ARM,

09:16.097 --> 09:18.724
SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO WORK WITH
STUFF THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE

09:18.808 --> 09:20.643
TO MAKE IT ALL FLOW.

09:22.103 --> 09:23.938
- FIVE, FOUR,

09:24.021 --> 09:26.023
THREE, TWO,

09:26.107 --> 09:26.649
ONE.

09:26.732 --> 09:29.986
TIME'S UP.

09:30.069 --> 09:31.737
- HEY, MAN, IF YOU HAVE
ONE GOOD, STRONG WING,

09:31.821 --> 09:32.822
THAT'S ALL YOU NEED, RIGHT?

09:32.905 --> 09:34.657
{\an8}- WE SAT THERE FOR AN HOUR,

09:34.740 --> 09:36.659
{\an8}AND JASON CAME UP WITH A WING.

09:36.742 --> 09:39.036
WHAT THE HELL DOES A WING HAVE
TO DO WITH CANCER RIBBON

09:39.120 --> 09:40.621
AND HIS FAMILY'S STRUGGLE?

09:40.705 --> 09:41.706
NOTHING.

09:44.875 --> 09:46.919
- DON.

09:47.003 --> 09:48.337
- YOU SAID YOUR FAMILY
WERE FIGHTERS,

09:48.421 --> 09:49.839
SO I PUT BOXING GLOVES,

09:49.922 --> 09:52.008
I PUT "THRIVE" DOWN THE BACK
OF HIS ARM.

09:52.091 --> 09:55.553
- I THINK THE BOXING GLOVES MAY
NOT APPEAL TO YOU, DEANGELO.

09:55.636 --> 09:57.596
YOU'RE NOT A BOXER.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.266
- THE "THRIVE," I THINK,
WAS A LITTLE BIT AGGRESSIVE.

10:00.349 --> 10:01.392
IT'S KIND OF BIG.

10:01.475 --> 10:03.311
- THE PLACEMENT ON THIS
IS JUST VERY STIFF.

10:06.188 --> 10:08.566
- ERIK.

10:08.649 --> 10:10.276
- I'M KNOWN
FOR MY JAPANESE ARTWORK,

10:10.359 --> 10:13.362
SO I FIGURED TO DO SOMETHING
A LITTLE BIT MORE SYMBOLIC.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.656
- I DON'T KNOW MUCH
ABOUT THE JAPANESE ART.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.908
WHERE I'M FROM, THEY'D PROBABLY
THINK IT WAS A CATFISH.

10:17.992 --> 10:22.496
- APPEALING TO THIS CLIENT,
HE HAS A SPECIFIC DIRECTION,

10:22.580 --> 10:24.206
AND IN ORDER TO WIN
OVER HIS SENSIBILITIES,

10:24.290 --> 10:26.792
YOU HAVE TO DRAW TOWARDS THAT.

10:26.876 --> 10:29.920
- MARK.

10:30.004 --> 10:31.130
- THIS IS YOUR STRENGTH,
THE SPEAR.

10:31.213 --> 10:33.257
THIS MAKES UP A SHAPE
OF THE CANCER RIBBON.

10:33.341 --> 10:35.551
THE THATCH-WORK REPRESENTS
TAKING CARE OF YOUR FAMILY

10:35.634 --> 10:36.886
AND PROTECTING YOUR FAMILY.

10:36.969 --> 10:39.889
- I REALLY APPRECIATE THE FACT
THAT YOU PUT

10:39.972 --> 10:43.392
EVERYTHING THAT I SAID
INTO YOUR ART.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.019
- I THINK WORKING WITH THE SHAPE
OF THE ARM HERE

10:45.102 --> 10:47.104
SHOWS THAT YOU REALLY PUT A LOT
OF THOUGHT INTO THE PLACEMENT

10:47.188 --> 10:47.855
OF THIS TATTOO.

10:47.938 --> 10:49.398
I THINK IT'S VERY NICE.

10:52.568 --> 10:54.445
- CRIS.

10:54.528 --> 10:57.323
- IT'S PLAIN, IT DOESN'T
HAVE THAT WOW FACTOR.

10:57.406 --> 11:01.077
I THINK YOU WENT SAFE AS OPPOSED
TO GOING FOR IT ALL.

11:01.160 --> 11:03.120
- IT'S VERY STIFF AND STAGNANT.

11:03.204 --> 11:05.039
YOU HEARD IT FROM THE CLIENT
HIMSELF.

11:05.122 --> 11:07.166
{\an8}- CRIS DID A CANCER RIBBON
WITH WINGS.

11:07.249 --> 11:08.376
{\an8}IT DOESN'T GET ANY MORE GENERIC
THAN THAT.

11:08.459 --> 11:10.252
WHEN THERE'S BIG CHALLENGE
IN FRONT OF HIM,

11:10.336 --> 11:12.254
CRIS SEEMS TO JUST GIVE UP.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.006
- CLEEN.

11:14.090 --> 11:15.841
- I LIKE THE WAY THIS DESIGN
IS PLACED

11:15.925 --> 11:17.468
BECAUSE THE FOCAL POINT
IS UP AND OUTWARD,

11:17.551 --> 11:18.928
AND THAT'S THE FIRST RULE

11:19.011 --> 11:20.638
IN WHERE YOU'RE GONNA PUT
SOMETHING ON THE BODY.

11:20.721 --> 11:22.932
- I LIKE THE CONCEPT BEHIND IT.

11:23.015 --> 11:26.644
YOU ENCOMPASSED EVERYTHING
THAT I SAID.

11:26.727 --> 11:27.812
- AARON.

11:27.895 --> 11:29.939
- I JUST WANTED TO DO A REALLY
NICE, CLEAN,

11:30.022 --> 11:31.482
STRONG, POWERFUL ROSE.

11:31.565 --> 11:32.900
- THIS BEING A PLACEMENT
CHALLENGE,

11:32.983 --> 11:34.777
I FEEL LIKE YOU DIDN'T REALLY DO
ANYTHING DYNAMIC

11:34.860 --> 11:36.404
TO WORK WITH THE SHAPE
OF THE BODY.

11:36.487 --> 11:37.947
IT'S KIND OF JUST STANDING
ON THE STICK THERE

11:38.030 --> 11:39.365
RIGHT THERE
ON THE TOP OF THE ARM.

11:39.448 --> 11:42.493
- YOU PLAYED IT REAL SAFE
AND GENERIC.

11:42.576 --> 11:43.661
- JASON.

11:43.744 --> 11:45.830
- THE BEST STATEMENTS ARE MADE
WITH SIMPLICITY.

11:45.913 --> 11:48.707
- BUT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY FIT
THE STORY THAT I TALKED ABOUT.

11:48.791 --> 11:51.961
I FEEL LIKE WITH AN HOUR
AND WHAT YOU GUYS HEARD FROM ME,

11:52.044 --> 11:53.671
IT SHOULD HAVE HELPED YOU GUYS
JUST GO ALL OR NOTHING.

11:53.754 --> 11:56.132
- HE'S LOOKING
FOR THAT WOW FACTOR.

11:56.215 --> 11:58.008
THERE IS A LOT OF MISSED
OPPORTUNITIES

11:58.092 --> 11:59.301
TO REALLY SHOW OFF.

12:02.596 --> 12:05.766
- TODAY WE'RE TESTING PLACEMENT
WITH FREEHANDED TATTOOS.

12:05.850 --> 12:08.269
IS THERE ANYBODY AS AN ARTIST
THAT SPOKE TO YOU?

12:08.352 --> 12:09.061
- POSSIBLY CLEEN.

12:09.145 --> 12:10.938
I KIND OF LIKED HIS CONCEPT.

12:11.021 --> 12:11.730
- FROM A DISTANCE, IT'S STRONG.

12:11.814 --> 12:14.024
IT'S A LEGIBLE DESIGN.

12:14.108 --> 12:16.360
IT'S KIND OF A REPRESENTATION
OF DIFFERENT THINGS YOU COULD DO

12:16.444 --> 12:17.403
TO FILL UP THE ARM.

12:17.486 --> 12:18.487
- THE ONLY PROBLEMS IS
I FEEL LIKE

12:18.571 --> 12:21.824
EVERYBODY THAT EVER LOST ANYBODY

12:21.907 --> 12:23.033
HAS THAT TATTOO.

12:23.117 --> 12:24.910
AND IT DOESN'T BELONG TO ME.

12:24.994 --> 12:26.787
AS OPPOSED TO MARK--

12:26.871 --> 12:29.081
I LIKE THE THOUGHT
THAT HE PUT INTO IT

12:29.165 --> 12:31.333
AND THE FACT THAT HE TOOK
SOME OF THE IDEAS

12:31.417 --> 12:32.918
FROM THE ONE SLEEVE
THAT I HAVE HERE

12:33.002 --> 12:34.503
AND PUT IT INTO HIS IDEAS.

12:34.587 --> 12:35.963
- I THINK HIS WOW FACTOR
TO YOU IS,

12:36.046 --> 12:38.174
"HEY, MAN, I'M HANGING
ON EVERY WORD YOU SAY.

12:38.257 --> 12:39.675
I CAN MAKE ALL THIS HAPPEN."

12:39.758 --> 12:41.802
AS FAR AS PLACEMENT GOES,

12:41.886 --> 12:43.554
MARK DID THE SWIRL ON THE ELBOW.

12:43.637 --> 12:45.181
HE USED THE BICEPS.

12:45.264 --> 12:48.517
HE USED THIS SPACE OF THE ARM
TO ACTUALLY SHOW A NICE CURVE.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.394
- I MEAN, I THINK THE TWO
OF THEM ARE CONTENDERS.

12:50.478 --> 12:52.771
DO WE HAVE A DECISION?

12:52.855 --> 12:54.190
- YEAH, I HAVE A DECISION.

12:54.273 --> 12:56.108
- LET'S LET 'EM KNOW.

13:00.571 --> 13:02.907
TODAY YOU HAD TO FREEHAND
A TATTOO DESIGN

13:02.990 --> 13:05.618
IN HONOR OF DEANGELO'S FAMILY
ON A BODY DOUBLE.

13:05.701 --> 13:07.036
- I'M ONE OF THE FEW CLIENTS

13:07.119 --> 13:08.704
THAT WALKED IN AND SIT DOWN
AND SAID,

13:08.787 --> 13:10.873
"HEY, MAN, I WANT A TATTOO,
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT."

13:10.956 --> 13:13.250
THERE WERE A COUPLE OF PEOPLE
THAT STOOD OUT.

13:13.334 --> 13:14.376
- HAVE YOU DECIDED
THAT THERE'S AN ARTIST

13:14.460 --> 13:16.212
THAT YOU WOULD LIKE
TO COLLABORATE WITH?

13:16.295 --> 13:19.173
- YEAH.

13:19.256 --> 13:20.257
I'M GONNA CHOOSE CLEEN.

13:20.341 --> 13:22.009
- CLEEN, CONGRATULATIONS.
- THANK YOU.

13:22.092 --> 13:26.805
YOU NOW HAVE ONE MORE HOUR
TO WORK DIRECTLY WITH DEANGELO,

13:26.889 --> 13:29.058
TAILORING YOUR DESIGN
TO DEANGELO'S FOREARM

13:29.141 --> 13:31.435
AND MAKING ANY CHANGES
HE WISHES.

13:31.519 --> 13:32.728
IF, AT THE END OF THAT HOUR,

13:32.811 --> 13:34.897
DEANGELO DECIDES THAT
HE WANTS YOU TO TATTOO HIM,

13:34.980 --> 13:38.234
THEN YOU HAVE WON
THE FLASH CHALLENGE.

13:38.317 --> 13:42.196
IF DEANGELO DECIDES THAT HE DOES
NOT LIKE WHAT YOU'VE DRAWN

13:42.279 --> 13:44.406
AND NO INK GOES ON HIS SKIN,

13:44.490 --> 13:46.784
THEN WE HAVE NO WINNER.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.619
- I REALLY WANT TO WIN
THIS FLASH CHALLENGE.

13:48.702 --> 13:50.246
I NEED TO BUST OUT ALL THE STOPS

13:50.329 --> 13:52.122
AND GIVE THIS GUY
EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTS.

13:52.206 --> 13:53.874
IF DEANGELO DOESN'T GET
TATTOOED,

13:53.958 --> 13:55.042
I'M GONNA BE PISSED.

13:55.125 --> 13:56.919
- HEAD BACK TO THE SHOP
AND GET TO WORK.

14:01.048 --> 14:02.258
{\an8}- SO DID YOU TATTOO OR DIDN'T?

14:02.341 --> 14:03.467
{\an8}- I'M FEELING SO STRESSED OUT
RIGHT NOW.

14:03.551 --> 14:06.262
{\an8}- NO PRESSURE, RIGHT?

14:06.345 --> 14:07.263
{\an8}- YOU STILL HEAR ME?

14:07.346 --> 14:09.557
{\an8}[bleep].
SHE'S PASSED OUT.

14:17.147 --> 14:19.316
- HELLO, MAN.
- HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON, MAN?

14:19.400 --> 14:20.484
- SO LET'S SIT DOWN
AND TALK.

14:20.568 --> 14:21.402
- ALL RIGHT, NO PRESSURE,
RIGHT?

14:21.485 --> 14:23.028
[laughs]

14:23.112 --> 14:25.322
- IF I DON'T TATTOO DEANGELO
WILLIAMS RIGHT NOW,

14:25.406 --> 14:26.407
I'M GONNA BE PISSED.

14:26.490 --> 14:27.700
I NEED TO WIN THIS FLASH
CHALLENGE

14:27.783 --> 14:29.326
TO GET THE NEXT SKULL PICK.

14:29.410 --> 14:33.706
WHAT'S ONE MAIN IMAGE
THAT YOU REALLY WANT TO SEE?

14:33.789 --> 14:36.959
- I DOESN'T NECESSARILY
HAVE TO BE PICTURES.

14:37.042 --> 14:38.752
OR IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY
HAVE TO BE WORDS.

14:38.836 --> 14:41.130
I'M LEANING MORE TOWARDS
ARTWORK.

14:41.213 --> 14:42.298
- HMM.

14:42.381 --> 14:45.301
I'M FEELING SO STRESSED OUT
RIGHT NOW.

14:45.384 --> 14:46.635
{\an8}I'M GONNA DRAW DIRECTLY
ON THE SKIN

14:46.719 --> 14:48.512
{\an8}TO GIVE DEANGELO SOME IDEAS,

14:48.596 --> 14:49.888
{\an8}BUT HONESTLY,
HE'S NOT GIVING ME NOTHING.

14:55.477 --> 14:56.729
ALL RIGHT, MAN.

14:56.812 --> 14:59.815
THAT'S IT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

14:59.898 --> 15:01.483
- YOU KNOW,
I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY...

15:04.987 --> 15:06.822
LET'S DO IT.
- AWESOME. RIGHT ON.

15:06.905 --> 15:09.033
- STRAIGHT FROM THE FLASH
CHALLENGE, MAN.

15:09.116 --> 15:10.159
THANKS.

15:10.242 --> 15:11.452
- THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO HEAR,
MAN.

15:11.535 --> 15:12.578
- AWESOME PIECE.

15:12.661 --> 15:14.705
I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU TAKING
EVERYTHING

15:14.788 --> 15:18.250
THAT I SAID IN CONSIDERATION
AND PUTTING IT INTO THIS TATTOO.

15:18.334 --> 15:19.835
YOU SEE LOVE,
YOU SEE HOPE,

15:19.918 --> 15:21.837
YOU SEE THE BREAST CANCER
RIBBON.

15:21.920 --> 15:24.798
YOU HONORED MY FAMILY
WITH THE OLIVE LEAF.

15:24.882 --> 15:25.966
IT'S PERFECT.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.259
- AWESOME.

15:27.343 --> 15:29.219
- GUESS I'LL PUT IN THE PAIN.
- HERE WE GO.

15:29.303 --> 15:30.971
- GUESS IT'S OFFICIAL NOW.

15:31.055 --> 15:33.766
- AFTER THROWING OUT
SO MANY IDEAS,

15:33.849 --> 15:36.477
IT'S SO GRATIFYING THAT HE IS
FINALLY GONNA GET A TATTOO

15:36.560 --> 15:38.687
THAT REALLY HONORED HIS MOM
AND FAMILY.

15:41.607 --> 15:44.360
{\an8}- I REALLY LOVE THIS PARTICULAR
TATTOO.

15:44.443 --> 15:48.238
IT REPRESENTS EVERYTHING
THAT I WANT MY TATTOO TO SAY

15:48.322 --> 15:49.615
ABOUT ME AND WHAT I'VE GONE
THROUGH IN MY LIFE.

15:49.698 --> 15:50.574
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.868
I'LL NEVER FORGET THIS,

15:52.951 --> 15:53.535
AND I'MA CONTINUE FIGHTING
THIS DISEASE

15:53.619 --> 15:55.746
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

15:55.829 --> 15:57.247
THANKS, MAN.
- THANK YOU.

15:57.331 --> 15:59.458
- YOU KNOW HOW CLEEN IS AND
HOW HE WORKS WITH HIS CANVASES.

15:59.541 --> 16:01.794
HE'S GOOD.

16:01.877 --> 16:03.712
BUT HOW MANY OF US THINK
HE ACTUALLY GOT HIM IN A CHAIR?

16:03.796 --> 16:04.672
- I'M SPLIT.
I JUST DON'T KNOW.

16:04.755 --> 16:06.256
I MEAN, OH, MAN,
THE SUSPENSE, MAN.

16:06.340 --> 16:07.758
I JUST--I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

16:07.841 --> 16:09.009
- YEAH.

16:09.093 --> 16:10.010
THERE HE IS.

16:10.094 --> 16:11.011
- OH, [bleep].

16:11.095 --> 16:12.137
- HOW'D IT GO?

16:12.221 --> 16:13.430
TELL US A TALE.
- HOW'D IT GO, DUDE?

16:13.514 --> 16:14.473
- LONG DAY.

16:14.556 --> 16:15.599
- WOW.

16:15.683 --> 16:16.642
[sighs]

16:16.725 --> 16:18.060
- SO DID YOU TATTOO
OR DIDN'T?

16:26.193 --> 16:27.361
- YEAH, I DID.

16:27.444 --> 16:28.404
- YOU GOT IT.
- OH!

16:28.487 --> 16:30.739
- OH, DUDE.
- NO [bleep] WAY.

16:30.823 --> 16:31.990
- IT'S ABOUT TIME.

16:32.074 --> 16:33.742
{\an8}ALL THESE GUYS KEEP RUNNING
AROUND SAYING,

16:33.826 --> 16:35.911
{\an8}"OOH, I WON A FLASH CHALLENGE.
I WON A FLASH CHALLENGE."

16:35.994 --> 16:37.037
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:37.121 --> 16:38.247
NOW THAT I GOT THIS FLASH
CHALLENGE,

16:38.330 --> 16:39.623
I'M GONNA BE RUTHLESS.

16:39.707 --> 16:41.333
I DON'T KNOW HOW EITHER
OF YOU TWO ARE STILL HERE.

16:41.417 --> 16:44.336
YOU GUYS ARE THE LOW GUYS
ON THE TOTEM POLE RIGHT NOW.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.755
I'M JUST GONNA GIVE YOU
A HARD CANVAS,

16:46.839 --> 16:48.048
SO YOU CAN PUT UP
OR SHUT UP.

16:48.132 --> 16:49.633
- THEN WE'LL PROVE YOU WRONG.
THAT'S IT.

16:49.717 --> 16:50.968
THAT'S THE ONLY THING
WE CAN DO.

16:51.051 --> 16:52.428
- I'M DEFINITELY GONNA GIVE YOU
SOMETHING

16:52.511 --> 16:54.722
THAT'S GONNA MAKE YOU HAVE
TO WORK FOR YOUR POSITION HERE.

16:54.805 --> 16:56.223
- THEN GO AHEAD.

16:56.306 --> 16:59.351
I'M NOT GONNA KISS YOUR ASS TO
TRY TO GET A BETTER SKULL PICK.

16:59.435 --> 17:01.520
BUT IT'S EASY TO GO
AFTER THE BOTTOM GUYS.

17:01.603 --> 17:02.855
WHY WOULD YOU NOT GO
AFTER THE TOP

17:02.938 --> 17:04.940
AND TRY TO PROVE THAT WHOEVER'S
ON THE TOP

17:05.022 --> 17:06.942
DESERVES TO BE ON THE TOP?

17:07.025 --> 17:08.652
- YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN SKATING BY,

17:08.736 --> 17:10.237
AND YOU'RE EITHER GONNA
SHUT ME UP,

17:10.319 --> 17:11.155
OR YOU'RE GOING [bleep] HOME.

17:27.003 --> 17:28.797
- WELCOME
TO THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.215
SURVIVE THIS TATTOO,

17:30.299 --> 17:32.760
AND YOU'LL BE ONE STEP CLOSER
TO $100,000,

17:32.843 --> 17:35.387
A FEATURE IN <i> INKED</i> MAGAZINE,

17:35.471 --> 17:37.556
AND THE TITLE OF INK MASTER.

17:37.639 --> 17:39.308
YOU'LL BE JUDGED BY OLIVER PECK,

17:39.391 --> 17:40.309
CHRIS NUNEZ,

17:40.392 --> 17:41.477
DEANGELO WILLIAMS,

17:41.560 --> 17:42.686
AND MYSELF.

17:42.770 --> 17:44.605
BUT WE'RE NOT YOUR ONLY CRITICS.

17:44.688 --> 17:48.275
EACH WEEK, YOU'LL ALSO BE JUDGED
BY AMERICA.

17:48.358 --> 17:50.819
VIEWERS AT HOME WILL
SCOUR EVERY DETAIL

17:50.903 --> 17:54.156
OF YOUR ELIMINATION TATTOOS
AT INKMASTER.SPIKE.COM

17:54.239 --> 17:57.534
AND VOTE FOR THE TATTOO
THAT THEY THINK IS THE BEST.

17:57.618 --> 18:00.871
AMERICA'S VOTE WILL HAVE
A MASSIVE IMPACT

18:00.954 --> 18:02.206
AT THE LIVE FINALE.

18:02.289 --> 18:03.415
THIS WEEK,

18:03.499 --> 18:04.583
WE'RE TESTING PLACEMENT.

18:04.666 --> 18:06.502
- PLACEMENT IS SO IMPORTANT
IN TATTOOING.

18:06.585 --> 18:11.381
{\an8}AN IMAGE THAT DOESN'T FLOW WELL
WITH THE BODY RUINS EVERYTHING.

18:11.465 --> 18:13.634
- IN EVERY ELIMINATION TATTOO,

18:13.717 --> 18:16.136
YOU WILL ALWAYS BE TATTOOING
HEAD-TO-HEAD

18:16.220 --> 18:18.806
WITH AT LEAST ONE OTHER ARTIST.

18:18.889 --> 18:22.142
TODAY YOU MUST ALL TATTOO
THE SAME SUBJECT

18:22.226 --> 18:24.812
ON THE SAME BODY PART.
- WHAT?

18:24.895 --> 18:28.398
- YOU MUST TATTOO A SKULL...

18:28.482 --> 18:29.608
ON YOUR CANVAS' HEAD.

18:29.691 --> 18:32.528
- OH, MAN.

18:32.611 --> 18:33.487
- WHAT THE [bleep]?

18:33.570 --> 18:35.489
{\an8}- I KNOW FROM FIRSTHAND
EXPERIENCE,

18:35.572 --> 18:37.533
{\an8}GETTING YOUR HEAD TATTOOED
IS NO FUN.

18:37.616 --> 18:38.700
IT'S CRAZY, DUDE.

18:38.784 --> 18:41.286
- I JUST HOPE THESE CANVASES
ARE PREPARED

18:41.370 --> 18:42.454
TO GO THROUGH SOME PAIN.

18:42.538 --> 18:43.205
- SOMEBODY'S GONNA HAVE
A HEADACHE.

18:43.288 --> 18:45.249
- THE SURFACE OF THE HEAD

18:45.332 --> 18:47.876
IS ROUND AND IRREGULARLY SHAPED.

18:47.960 --> 18:51.213
A SKULL IS ONE OF
THE MOST ICONIC TATTOO DESIGNS,

18:51.296 --> 18:52.381
BUT MAKING IT FLOW

18:52.464 --> 18:54.591
AND FIT WITH THE CONTOURS
OF THE HEAD

18:54.675 --> 18:57.219
IS A TRUE TEST
OF YOUR PLACEMENT SKILLS.

18:57.302 --> 18:59.721
{\an8}- PROPER PLACEMENT ON A SKULL
IS SO DIFFICULT

18:59.805 --> 19:01.348
{\an8}BECAUSE IT'S LIKE TATTOOING
ON A BOWL.

19:01.431 --> 19:03.600
THERE'S CURVES THIS WAY,
THERE ARE CURVES THAT WAY.

19:03.684 --> 19:04.226
- LET'S MEET YOUR CANVASES.

19:13.861 --> 19:15.404
- CLEEN,
YOU WON THE FLASH CHALLENGE.

19:15.487 --> 19:18.782
YOU NOW HAVE THE POWER
TO ASSIGN ALL HUMAN CANVASES.

19:18.866 --> 19:20.117
- ALL RIGHT.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.244
I DON'T FEEL LIKE I SHOULD HAVE
TO COMPETE WITH ARTISTS

19:22.327 --> 19:24.246
THAT AREN'T UP TO MY LEVEL.

19:24.329 --> 19:25.539
{\an8}WE GOT TO GET THESE WEAKLINGS
OUT OF HERE.

19:25.622 --> 19:27.124
{\an8}YOU'RE LOOKING TO GET A SKULL
ON THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD.

19:27.207 --> 19:30.919
{\an8}- VERY EVIL, SICK, DEMONIC
SKULL.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.422
{\an8}- I KNOW CLEEN IS GUNNING FOR ME
WITH THIS SKULL PICK.

19:33.505 --> 19:34.047
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT?
BRING IT ON.

19:34.131 --> 19:36.258
{\an8}- I WANT SOMETHING SICK.

19:36.341 --> 19:37.092
{\an8}I WANT PEOPLE TO LOOK AT IT
AND BE LIKE,

19:37.175 --> 19:38.969
{\an8}"WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU, BOY?"

19:39.052 --> 19:40.137
{\an8}- OKAY.

19:40.220 --> 19:42.681
{\an8}- I WANTED TO GET FLOWERS
AND PEARLS WITH IT.

19:42.764 --> 19:46.143
{\an8}SHE'S A VERY PETITE GIRL, AND
SHE DOESN'T HAVE MANY TATTOOS.

19:46.226 --> 19:47.811
{\an8}I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF SHE'S GONNA
BE ABLE TO TAKE IT.

19:47.895 --> 19:50.564
{\an8}- SKULL FRAGMENTS
WITH LOTS OF GEMS

19:50.647 --> 19:52.316
{\an8}AND, LIKE, JEWELS AND STUFF.

19:52.399 --> 19:55.694
{\an8}- ALL THE GEOMETRICAL SHAPES
AND THE GEMS ON A ROUND SURFACE?

19:55.777 --> 19:57.404
{\an8}THAT IS GONNA BE A PAIN
IN THE ASS.

19:57.487 --> 19:59.656
{\an8}- OKAY.

19:59.740 --> 20:00.782
{\an8}LET'S SEE HERE.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.784
{\an8}- CLEEN'S GONNA TRY TO KNOCK ME
OUT OF HERE,

20:02.868 --> 20:04.161
{\an8}BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
WHAT CANVAS CLEEN GIVES ME.

20:04.244 --> 20:07.998
{\an8}I'M READY TO BLOW
THIS OUT OF THE WATER.

20:08.081 --> 20:09.291
- THAT WAS PRETTY TOUGH.

20:09.374 --> 20:11.585
I FELT LIKE I COULD DO
ALL OF THEM PRETTY WELL.

20:11.668 --> 20:13.962
- CANVASES,
ONE BY ONE,

20:14.046 --> 20:15.631
PLEASE READ THE ARTIST'S NAME
ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SKULL.

20:15.714 --> 20:17.466
- JASON.

20:19.134 --> 20:20.135
- ERIK.

20:26.266 --> 20:26.350
- MARK.

20:36.151 --> 20:36.985
- CRIS.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.362
- CLEEN TRIED TO SCREW ME OVER,

20:38.445 --> 20:40.155
BUT HE GAVE ME THE CANVAS
THAT I WANTED THE MOST.

20:40.238 --> 20:42.658
{\an8}THIS IS THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY
FOR ME TO SHOW

20:42.741 --> 20:44.576
{\an8}WHERE I STAND
AMONGST THE TOP GUYS.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.161
- AARON.

20:46.244 --> 20:47.162
- RIGHT HERE.

20:47.245 --> 20:47.663
- DON.

20:47.746 --> 20:49.790
- ME.

20:49.873 --> 20:51.166
- CLEEN ROCK ONE.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.834
- MY CANVAS IS DOWN
FOR ANYTHING.

20:52.918 --> 20:54.836
{\an8}SO I WANT TO REALLY FLEX
SOME SKILLS

20:54.920 --> 20:56.588
{\an8}AND SHOW THESE GUYS
THAT I'M TOP DOG HERE.

20:56.672 --> 20:59.341
- REMEMBER, GUYS,
AFTER THE ELIMINATION TATTOO,

20:59.424 --> 21:02.552
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
WILL VOTE ON THE TATTOO

21:02.636 --> 21:04.513
THAT THEY THINK IS THE WORST

21:04.596 --> 21:06.556
AND PUT ONE ARTIST UP
FOR ELIMINATION.

21:06.640 --> 21:11.061
YOU'LL HAVE FIVE HOURS
TO TATTOO A SKULL ON A SKULL.

21:11.144 --> 21:12.688
BASED ON YOUR WORK,

21:12.771 --> 21:15.190
ONE OF YOU WILL CLOSE SHOP.

21:15.273 --> 21:18.193
GOOD LUCK.

21:18.276 --> 21:21.196
{\an8}- TATTOOING A SKULL IS SOMETHING
EVERYBODY SHOULD EXCEL AT.

21:21.279 --> 21:22.489
IT'S ICONIC IMAGERY.

21:22.572 --> 21:23.699
- WHAT'S UP?
- HOW'S IT GOING, MAN?

21:23.782 --> 21:25.409
- AARON.
- TATTOOING ON THE HEAD

21:25.492 --> 21:26.952
IS GONNA BE
THE TRICKIEST PART OF THIS.

21:27.035 --> 21:29.621
IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE,
IT REALLY SHOWS.

21:29.705 --> 21:30.998
- I'VE BEEN WAITING
TO DO MY HEAD.

21:31.081 --> 21:32.541
- I'VE DONE A BUNCH
OF HEAD TATTOOS.

21:32.624 --> 21:34.001
THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

21:34.084 --> 21:37.045
- THE SKULL AND ROSE IS A...
OBSCENELY COMMON IMAGERY.

21:37.129 --> 21:40.090
{\an8}THE JUDGES HAVE OFFICIALLY
DEEMED ROSES AS A SAFE PLAY

21:40.173 --> 21:41.508
{\an8}ON ANY [bleep] TATTOO.

21:41.591 --> 21:43.719
I'M IMAGINING SOMETHING
A LITTLE BIT MORE DRASTIC

21:43.802 --> 21:45.470
AND LITTLE BIT MORE EXTREME--
JUST BANG.

21:45.554 --> 21:47.681
I HAVE TO DO SOME
KNOCK-YOUR-SOCKS-OFF [bleep]

21:47.764 --> 21:48.724
WITH THIS ONE.

21:48.807 --> 21:51.226
- WHERE DO YOU WANT THE TATTOO
TO BE?

21:51.309 --> 21:53.395
- RIGHT IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD.

21:53.478 --> 21:54.563
- WELL, THE PROBLEM IS
YOU HAVE A RIDGE RIGHT HERE.

21:54.646 --> 21:57.774
{\an8}MY CANVAS HAS A HUGE ROLL
IN THE BACK OF HIS NECK,

21:57.858 --> 21:59.735
{\an8}AND THAT'S GONNA MAKE IT REALLY
DIFFICULT FOR ME

21:59.818 --> 22:01.153
{\an8}TO LINE UP THE SKULL.

22:01.236 --> 22:03.447
SO IF I COULD PUT SOMEHOW
THE BRIDGE AND A NOSE ON THAT--

22:03.530 --> 22:04.740
PLACEMENT IS EVERYTHING TODAY.

22:04.823 --> 22:06.324
I HAVE TO SOMEHOW FIT THE ROLL
INTO MY DESIGN.

22:06.408 --> 22:09.536
SO ARE YOU COOL IF WE DO, LIKE,
HERE, UP.

22:09.619 --> 22:11.496
- I WOULD LIKE THE WHOLE SKULL.

22:11.580 --> 22:14.499
- IT'S GONNA BE A LOT TOUGHER
THAN I THOUGHT.

22:23.550 --> 22:25.052
- THINK I SHOULD GO BIGGER
WITH THIS?

22:25.135 --> 22:27.846
LOOK AT IT ON THE BACK
OF MY HEAD.

22:27.929 --> 22:29.639
- YEAH, THAT TAKES UP, LIKE,
THE WHOLE BACK OF YOUR HEAD.

22:29.723 --> 22:31.600
- YEAH.

22:31.683 --> 22:32.893
IN THE BACK OF MY MIND,

22:32.976 --> 22:34.603
I KNOW SOMETHING'S OFF
ABOUT THIS DESIGN.

22:34.686 --> 22:35.771
I CAN'T PINPOINT IT.

22:35.854 --> 22:37.773
I DON'T KNOW WHY
FOR THE LIFE OF ME,

22:37.856 --> 22:38.940
BUT IT'S MAKING ME CRAZY.

22:39.024 --> 22:41.068
IT WOULD LOOK FUNNY
IF IT WRAPPED TOO MUCH

22:41.151 --> 22:42.527
ON THE TOP OF HIS HEAD.
LIKE, IT'S GOT TO BE

22:42.611 --> 22:44.946
JUST A STRAIGHT-ON HEAD SHOT
BACK THERE, DON'T YOU THINK?

22:45.030 --> 22:46.156
- UM...

22:46.239 --> 22:47.908
JASON'S ALL FRAZZLED
ON HIS CRAPPY DESIGN.

22:47.991 --> 22:49.076
AND GUESS WHAT.

22:49.159 --> 22:50.702
IT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE CRAP
NO MATTER WHAT,

22:50.786 --> 22:52.245
AND THAT'S NOT MY PROBLEM.

22:55.540 --> 22:57.959
- ARTISTS, YOU HAVE FIVE HOURS

22:58.043 --> 23:00.253
TO TATTOO A SKULL
ON A SKULL.

23:00.337 --> 23:00.837
YOUR TIME...

23:00.921 --> 23:03.173
BEGINS...

23:03.256 --> 23:04.633
NOW.
- WOW!

23:04.716 --> 23:06.009
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO THIS.

23:06.093 --> 23:07.552
- LET'S GO, MAN.
LET'S DO THIS.

23:07.636 --> 23:08.762
- WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR TODAY

23:08.845 --> 23:10.305
IN THIS CHALLENGE
IS BADASS TATTOOS.

23:10.388 --> 23:12.808
{\an8}THE ONE THING ABOUT A TATTOO
PLACEMENT BEING ON THE HEAD,

23:12.891 --> 23:15.352
{\an8}THIS IS A VERY PROMINENT AREA
OF SKIN FOR THEM TO DISPLAY.

23:15.435 --> 23:17.312
IF IT'S A LITTLE BIT OFF,
IT SHOWS.

23:19.064 --> 23:20.816
WE'RE GONNA SEE WHO'S DOING
SOLID TATTOOS

23:20.899 --> 23:22.317
AND WHO'S NOT.

23:22.400 --> 23:23.777
- ALL RIGHT, MAN, ANY TIME YOU
NEED TO STOP OR TAKE A BREAK

23:23.860 --> 23:24.444
OR ANYTHING, JUST LET ME KNOW.
- MENTALLY READY FOR THIS,

23:24.528 --> 23:26.446
RIGHT?
- YES.

23:26.530 --> 23:27.114
- ALL RIGHT, WHATEVER YOU DO,
JUST DON'T MOVE.

23:27.197 --> 23:29.616
[tattoo gun buzzing]

23:32.327 --> 23:34.496
- OKAY, DUDE.
[bleep] IT.

23:34.579 --> 23:35.914
LET'S TATTOO, MAN.

23:35.997 --> 23:37.165
{\an8}I'M REALLY FEELING THE PRESSURE
OF THIS COMPETITION.

23:37.249 --> 23:39.167
I AM NOT READY TO GO HOME.

23:39.251 --> 23:40.168
I DON'T GIVE A [bleep].

23:40.252 --> 23:41.670
IF I'M GOING DOWNWARD SPIRAL,

23:41.753 --> 23:43.213
I'M GONNA GO RIGHT BACK
THE [bleep] UP,

23:43.296 --> 23:44.506
AND I'M GONNA WIN.

23:44.589 --> 23:46.174
FORGIVE ME IF I DON'T TALK
TOO MUCH, DUDE.

23:46.258 --> 23:47.425
I'M TRYING TO WIN.

23:47.509 --> 23:48.844
I'M GONNA PROVE TO EVERYONE

23:48.927 --> 23:50.720
THAT JASON CLAY DUNN IS HERE
TO BATTLE.

23:50.804 --> 23:51.346
I CAN DO THIS.

23:51.429 --> 23:52.848
HOW'S THAT, BRO?

23:55.600 --> 23:56.977
[tattoo gun buzzing]

23:57.060 --> 23:58.353
- DOING ALL RIGHT?
- YEAH, MAN.

23:58.436 --> 24:00.313
I JUST KEEP TELLING MYSELF
I'M A BADASS.

24:00.397 --> 24:03.358
- I'VE HONESTLY, LIKE,
NOT TATTOOED A LOT OF HEADS.

24:03.442 --> 24:06.194
I'M FULLY FOCUSED ON THE TATTOO.

24:06.278 --> 24:07.904
{\an8}I CAN'T AFFORD TO LET ANYONE
OR ANYTHING

24:07.988 --> 24:09.364
{\an8}GET IN MY HEAD RIGHT NOW.

24:09.447 --> 24:10.448
- IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU DID
SOME GOOD TATTOO WORK.

24:10.532 --> 24:13.577
- I'M TRYING, MAN.
I'M TRYING, MAN.

24:13.660 --> 24:14.953
I DODGED A BULLET LAST WEEK.

24:15.036 --> 24:17.205
- YOU CONTINUALLY
STILL MAKE CHOICES

24:17.289 --> 24:18.957
THAT ARE SETTING YOURSELF UP
FOR FAILURE.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.333
- IT WAS JUST A POOR DESIGN
CHOICE,

24:20.417 --> 24:22.043
AND I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THAT.

24:22.127 --> 24:24.963
I CAN COMPETE WITH
THE TOP GUYS HERE.

24:25.046 --> 24:27.090
- YOU DEFINITELY NEED A WIN,
MAN.

24:27.174 --> 24:29.551
- I'M HERE TO PROVE
THAT I AM A GOOD TATTOO ARTIST,

24:29.634 --> 24:30.969
AND I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

24:31.052 --> 24:31.887
- THREE MORE HOURS, GUYS.

24:31.970 --> 24:33.889
- YEAH, THAT TOP'S A [bleep].

24:33.972 --> 24:35.265
- [laughs]

24:35.348 --> 24:37.475
WHOO, YES, IT IS.

24:37.559 --> 24:39.644
[tattoo gun buzzing]

24:44.649 --> 24:46.651
- [groans]
[bleep] MY LIFE.

24:48.278 --> 24:50.572
{\an8}- ONLY THING I'M REALLY WORRIED
ABOUT IN THIS ENTIRE CHALLENGE

24:50.655 --> 24:52.574
{\an8}IS WHETHER OR NOT MY CANVAS
CAN SIT FOR THE TATTOO.

24:56.786 --> 24:58.330
{\an8}- OH, I WON'T PASS OUT.

24:58.413 --> 24:59.664
{\an8}- SHE'S REALLY IN PAIN.

25:00.916 --> 25:01.583
{\an8}- WHY WOULD I GIVE UP?

25:01.666 --> 25:03.293
{\an8}- THERE IS NO WAY IN HELL

25:03.376 --> 25:04.961
{\an8}I'M GOING HOME
BECAUSE OF MY CANVAS.

25:05.045 --> 25:06.213
YOU FEELING OKAY?

25:06.296 --> 25:07.505
- MY EAR HURTS.

25:07.589 --> 25:08.840
- TWO HOURS TO GO.

25:08.924 --> 25:10.884
- SOMEBODY'S FINALLY
STARTING TO FEEL IT.

25:10.967 --> 25:13.220
- GOD...
DAMN.

25:15.430 --> 25:17.265
{\an8}- THE TATTOO'S COMING OUT
BETTER THAN I EXPECTED,

25:17.349 --> 25:19.601
{\an8}AND THE COLORS ARE REALLY
POPPING AGAINST HIS SKIN.

25:20.727 --> 25:23.772
MY BIGGEST MOTIVATION
IS MY THREE KIDS.

25:23.855 --> 25:25.190
MY FAMILY IS EVERYTHING TO ME.

25:25.273 --> 25:26.775
I PLAN ON COMING HOME
AND HUGGING THEM

25:26.858 --> 25:28.276
WITH A BIG CHECK
IN MY BACK POCKET.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.195
- YOU AND ERIK KIND
OF DID THE SAME TATTOO.

25:30.278 --> 25:32.656
YOU GUYS USE THE SAME STENCIL?

25:32.739 --> 25:35.742
{\an8}- DOESN'T EVEN MATTER
IF DON LOOKED AT MY DESIGN,

25:35.825 --> 25:37.661
{\an8}'CAUSE I KNOW HE'S NOT GONNA BE
ABLE TO EXECUTE IT

25:37.744 --> 25:40.038
{\an8}NEARLY AS CLEANLY AS I DO.

25:40.121 --> 25:41.665
DON JUST SIGNED
HIS OWN DEATH WARRANT

25:41.748 --> 25:43.291
BY DOING THIS TATTOO.

25:43.375 --> 25:46.211
IT JUST LOOKS LIKE [bleep].

25:46.294 --> 25:49.047
- I'M STOKED.
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT.

25:49.130 --> 25:50.048
- UGH.

25:50.131 --> 25:54.052
- FEEL OKAY?

25:54.135 --> 25:55.303
- MM.

25:57.389 --> 25:59.349
- CAN YOU STILL HEAR ME?

25:59.432 --> 26:00.725
- MM.
- [bleep].

26:00.809 --> 26:01.393
SHE'S PASSED OUT.

26:01.476 --> 26:04.271
MY CANVAS GOES OUT COLD.

26:04.354 --> 26:05.814
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON.

26:05.897 --> 26:06.481
- HOW'S MY VOICE SOUND
TO YOU?

26:06.564 --> 26:07.941
CLEAR?
- NO.

26:08.024 --> 26:09.818
- OKAY.

26:13.280 --> 26:15.824
JUST CHECKING
YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE.

26:15.907 --> 26:17.826
- IF I CAN'T GET THE BELLS
AND WHISTLES ON THIS THING,

26:17.909 --> 26:18.535
AND I CAN'T FINISH,

26:18.618 --> 26:22.205
I'M TOTALLY SCREWED.

26:22.289 --> 26:24.040
- IT JUST HAPPENED
OUT OF NOWHERE.

26:24.124 --> 26:26.668
- SHE'LL PROBABLY BE ALL RIGHT.

26:26.751 --> 26:29.587
- 30 MINUTES REMAINING.

26:29.671 --> 26:31.673
[tattoo gun buzzing]

26:31.756 --> 26:33.508
- YOU ALL RIGHT?
- THERE'S BEEN WORSE.

26:33.591 --> 26:36.886
- MOTHER[bleep] HURT.

26:38.638 --> 26:39.723
{\an8}NO, YOU'RE GOOD, MAN.

26:39.806 --> 26:41.391
{\an8}IT'S NEEDLES.
IT'S GONNA HURT.

26:41.474 --> 26:44.060
{\an8}- WE'RE DOWN TO SEVEN ARTISTS.
THE STAKES ARE HIGH RIGHT NOW.

26:44.144 --> 26:45.687
I'M GONNA BRING
ALL OF MY ABILITIES,

26:45.770 --> 26:47.397
AND I'M GONNA STAY SO FOCUSED

26:47.480 --> 26:49.274
THAT THERE'S NO STOPPING ME.

26:49.357 --> 26:50.859
- FOR MY OWN PERSONAL SELFISH
REASONS,

26:50.942 --> 26:53.361
I WANT YOU TO HAVE
THE BEST TATTOO TODAY.

26:55.155 --> 26:55.864
GOD, I JUST WANT TO WIN.

26:55.947 --> 26:58.033
- OW.

26:58.116 --> 26:58.992
- WE'RE GETTING CLOSE.

26:59.075 --> 27:00.952
- TEN, NINE,

27:01.036 --> 27:03.246
EIGHT, SEVEN,

27:03.330 --> 27:04.956
SIX, FIVE,

27:05.040 --> 27:07.125
FOUR, THREE,

27:07.208 --> 27:08.126
TWO,

27:08.209 --> 27:09.627
ONE.

27:09.711 --> 27:11.171
THAT'S IT.
TIME'S UP. MACHINES DOWN.

27:11.254 --> 27:13.506
NO MORE TATTOOING.

27:13.590 --> 27:15.258
- ALL RIGHT, MY MAN.
YOU'RE DONE.

27:15.342 --> 27:16.051
- OH, WOW.

27:16.134 --> 27:18.553
- OH, MY GOD.

27:18.636 --> 27:20.388
THAT WAS SO WORTH EVERYTHING.
- YEAH?

27:20.472 --> 27:23.058
- OH, THAT [bleep] IS SICK.

27:23.141 --> 27:25.310
- ALMOST NOT READY FOR IT.

27:25.393 --> 27:26.978
- [laughs] OH, THAT'S INTENSE.

27:27.062 --> 27:28.229
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT JASON'S
THINKING WITH THIS TATTOO,

27:28.313 --> 27:30.398
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE [bleep].

27:30.482 --> 27:32.067
THE PLACEMENT IS REALLY WEIRD.

27:32.150 --> 27:33.401
THE DRAWING IS LACKING.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.195
JASON NEEDS TO PUT HIS BIG BOY
PANTS ON

27:35.278 --> 27:36.488
AND REALLY STEP UP HIS GAME

27:36.571 --> 27:37.864
IF HE WANTS TO STAY IN
THIS COMPETITION.

27:39.824 --> 27:41.242
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU GUYS ARE [bleep] UP.

27:41.326 --> 27:42.786
{\an8}- EVERYBODY HAS A FALL.

27:42.869 --> 27:44.079
{\an8}GET READY FOR YOURS TOO.

27:44.162 --> 27:45.914
{\an8}- YOUR DRAWING IS NOT UP
TO PAR TO WIN THIS THING.

27:45.997 --> 27:49.250
{\an8}- YOU HAVE BEEN CONSISTENTLY
IN THE BOTTOM THE WHOLE TIME.

27:49.334 --> 27:51.753
{\an8}- JUST ROUGH.
- HOW CAN YOU BE INK MASTER?

27:59.052 --> 28:01.096
- I DID NOT CARE
FOR JASON'S TATTOO.

28:01.179 --> 28:04.182
- YEAH, JASON'S--I DIDN'T LIKE
THE OVERALL DRAWING AT ALL.

28:04.265 --> 28:05.433
- IT WAS HARD TO READ.

28:05.517 --> 28:07.060
- DEFINITELY,
I THINK HE DROPPED THE BALL.

28:07.143 --> 28:09.145
- WHAT HAPPENED?

28:09.229 --> 28:10.939
- WHAT?

28:11.022 --> 28:12.774
- WHAT'S UP WITH YOUR TATTOO?

28:12.857 --> 28:14.901
- I THOUGHT IT WAS COOL.

28:14.984 --> 28:16.403
- I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

28:16.486 --> 28:18.029
- WELL, WHAT WERE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT?

28:18.113 --> 28:19.322
I MEAN, LIKE,
SOMEBODY SUFFER OR WHAT?

28:19.406 --> 28:22.742
- I THINK WE--WE KIND OF AGREED
THAT YOURS WAS KIND OF

28:22.826 --> 28:23.493
HARD TO READ.

28:23.576 --> 28:25.870
- YEAH, THAT'S GREAT.

28:25.954 --> 28:27.497
SO YOU GUYS WERE SITTING OUT
HERE TALKING [bleep] ABOUT ME.

28:27.580 --> 28:28.873
ALL RIGHT.

28:28.957 --> 28:29.624
SORRY I DIDN'T DO SOME GIANT,
BIG CARTOONY THING

28:29.707 --> 28:30.667
LIKE THE REST OF YOU GUYS,

28:30.750 --> 28:33.294
BUT THAT'S WHAT MY CANVAS
WANTED.

28:33.378 --> 28:36.965
SO I GUESS THE JUDGES WILL HAVE
ANOTHER FIELD DAY ON ME.

28:37.048 --> 28:39.467
{\an8}- I THINK MAYBE THE STRESS OF
THE HOUSE IS GETTING TO JASON.

28:39.551 --> 28:42.637
HIS ANXIETY IS A WEAKNESS.

28:42.720 --> 28:44.848
YOU FEELING OKAY?

28:44.931 --> 28:46.266
- WELL, MAN,
WHEN I COME IN HERE,

28:46.349 --> 28:48.601
AND YOU ALL ARE TALKING [bleep]
ABOUT MY TATTOO...

28:48.685 --> 28:50.979
- OH.

28:51.062 --> 28:52.272
- [bleep].

28:52.355 --> 28:54.023
[bleep] STUPID.

28:54.107 --> 28:55.608
YOU GUYS ARE JUST TRYING
TO GET IN MY HEAD.

28:55.692 --> 28:57.318
- WHAT'S--WHAT'S GOING ON?

28:57.402 --> 28:58.153
- WHAT?
- WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

28:58.236 --> 28:59.696
- I DON'T WANT TO SIT HERE

28:59.779 --> 29:01.739
AND JUST HAVING YOU THINK, YOU
KNOW, THAT I'M OUT OF MY MIND

29:01.823 --> 29:02.740
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

29:02.824 --> 29:03.741
IT'S BULL[bleep].

29:03.825 --> 29:06.035
I'M SICK OF THIS.

29:06.119 --> 29:08.913
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS ARE
JUST [bleep] WITH ME, MAN.

29:08.997 --> 29:10.748
[bleep].

29:23.219 --> 29:27.140
- TODAY YOU HAD TO TATTOO
A PERFECTLY PLACED SKULL

29:27.223 --> 29:29.225
ON YOUR CANVAS' HEAD.

29:29.309 --> 29:31.102
CLEEN, LET'S START WITH YOU.

29:33.313 --> 29:35.315
- WELL, CLEEN, I LIKE
THE PLACEMENT OF THIS TATTOO.

29:35.398 --> 29:37.358
IT FILLS UP THE WHOLE AREA
AT THE TOP OF THE HEAD.

29:37.442 --> 29:39.235
YOU GOT A LOT OF NICE TONES
AND SHADES,

29:39.319 --> 29:40.528
TO BLACK TO THE BROWN
TO THE BRONZY YELLOW,

29:40.612 --> 29:42.864
I THINK PLAYS REALLY WELL

29:42.947 --> 29:44.532
AGAINST THIS GRAY SHADING
IN THE SKULL.

29:44.616 --> 29:45.867
- I REALLY LIKED THE FACT
THAT YOU TOOK THE TIME

29:45.950 --> 29:49.078
TO ADD ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT
LITTLE DETAILS

29:49.162 --> 29:50.997
AND INTRICATE DESIGN ELEMENTS.

29:51.080 --> 29:52.999
YOU ADDED SO MUCH TO THIS DESIGN

29:53.082 --> 29:54.876
TO MAKE IT REALLY UNIQUE
AND COOL.

29:54.959 --> 29:55.877
- THANK YOU.

29:58.588 --> 30:01.090
- JASON.

30:01.174 --> 30:03.885
- IT DEFINITELY DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE A SKULL.

30:03.968 --> 30:06.137
IT KIND OF LOOKS
LIKE A LATEX MASK.

30:06.221 --> 30:07.639
- OKAY, I CAN SEE THAT,

30:07.722 --> 30:09.766
BECAUSE A LOT OF THESE OLD
SKULLS, THEY HAD, LIKE, SKIN.

30:09.849 --> 30:10.934
THEY WERE, LIKE, MUMMIFIED.

30:11.017 --> 30:12.143
- THIS HAS TO BE CLEAR.

30:12.227 --> 30:12.936
YOU HAVE TO MAKE THIS STUFF
READABLE.

30:13.019 --> 30:14.896
YOU HAVE A LOT OF AREAS IN THIS

30:14.979 --> 30:16.898
WHERE YOU JUST NEEDED
TO GO A LOT LIGHTER.

30:16.981 --> 30:19.275
THE FOREHEAD'S MORE DEEP SET
THAN THE EYES AND THE NOSE.

30:19.359 --> 30:20.276
AND THIS TATTOO,
FROM A DISTANCE,

30:20.360 --> 30:24.072
IS HARD TO READ.

30:24.155 --> 30:27.909
- AARON.

30:27.992 --> 30:30.036
THESE ROSES ARE VERY STYLIZED.
TELL ME ABOUT THAT.

30:30.119 --> 30:31.246
- THIS WAS RISKY,
AND I KNOW IT WAS,

30:31.329 --> 30:33.873
BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO GO
A TRADITIONAL ROUTE.

30:33.957 --> 30:34.958
- WE'VE SEEN YOU DO SKULLS
LIKE THIS BEFORE,

30:35.041 --> 30:37.377
BUT THIS ONE'S
A LITTLE SMOOTHER.

30:37.460 --> 30:39.420
THE AREAS OF BLACK
ARE REALLY SOLID.

30:39.504 --> 30:40.547
THE GRAY SHADING AREAS
ARE REALLY SOFT,

30:40.630 --> 30:42.924
AND I LOVE THE PLACEMENT.

30:43.007 --> 30:45.635
THE ANGLE OF THE SKULL SITTING
THERE FITS REALLY WELL.

30:45.718 --> 30:47.470
- THE SKULL, I LIKE.
- YOU DON'T LIKE THE ROSES.

30:47.554 --> 30:48.471
- NOT AT ALL.

30:48.555 --> 30:50.181
- I KNEW IT WAS GONNA BE
ONE OF YOU GUYS.

30:50.265 --> 30:51.641
- BETWEEN THE DESIGN

30:51.724 --> 30:53.685
AND THE REALLY SCRATCHY AREAS
OF THE OUTLINE,

30:53.768 --> 30:55.270
IT IS NOT FLATTERING.

30:55.353 --> 30:58.314
AND I'VE SEEN ROSES FROM YOU
THROUGHOUT THIS COMPETITION,

30:58.398 --> 30:59.482
AND I HAVEN'T LIKED ONE.

30:59.566 --> 31:01.776
THIS IS JUST ANOTHER ONE
THAT I DISLIKE.

31:03.361 --> 31:06.823
- DON.

31:06.906 --> 31:08.700
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT
THE CANVAS YOU GOT?

31:08.783 --> 31:10.618
- MY CANVAS WAS
AN ABSOLUTE MANIAC.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.161
HIS MAIN REASON FOR THIS TATTOO

31:12.245 --> 31:12.996
WAS HE WANTED TO PISS PEOPLE
OFF.

31:13.079 --> 31:14.872
- IF HE WANTED, LIKE, BADASS,

31:14.956 --> 31:17.125
I FEEL LIKE ANY OTHER COLOR
BUT GREEN

31:17.208 --> 31:18.251
WOULD HAVE MADE IT STAND OUT.

31:18.334 --> 31:19.168
- WHAT COLOR WOULD
YOU HAVE CHOSE?

31:19.252 --> 31:20.712
- SOMETHING ELSE,
NOT GREEN.

31:20.795 --> 31:23.756
- THE BIG THING FOR ME IS,

31:23.840 --> 31:25.925
YOU HAVE TWO DIFFERENT-LOOKING
TATTOOS.

31:26.009 --> 31:27.302
YOU HAVE ONE THAT'S VERY
TEXTURED

31:27.385 --> 31:28.636
AND ONE THAT'S VERY SMOOTH.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.471
SO YOU HAVE A VERY SLICK SKULL
FROM EYES DOWN

31:30.555 --> 31:32.307
AND VERY TEXTURED SKULL
ON THE TOP.

31:32.390 --> 31:33.600
THAT THROWS YOUR COMPOSITION
AND YOUR DESIGN,

31:33.683 --> 31:35.768
YOUR DRAWING ELEMENT OFF.

31:35.852 --> 31:37.312
YOU GOT TO MAKE ALL THAT STUFF
MATCH.

31:37.395 --> 31:40.565
DON'T DO 50/50.

31:40.648 --> 31:41.024
- ERIK.

31:44.235 --> 31:45.486
- YOU GOT A LOT OF NICE DETAIL.

31:45.570 --> 31:46.904
I THINK IT'S VERY SMOOTH.

31:46.988 --> 31:48.865
{\an8}I THINK IT'S VERY TOUGH,
VERY EVIL-LOOKING TATTOO.

31:48.948 --> 31:51.159
{\an8}I LOVE THE CRISP, SHARP AREAS
OF THE HORNS.

31:51.242 --> 31:52.660
AND I THINK THE PLACEMENT
IS GREAT.

31:52.744 --> 31:56.331
- THE EYES ARE THE SINGLE
BEST PART OF THIS TATTOO.

31:56.414 --> 31:57.498
BECAUSE PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY

31:57.582 --> 31:59.709
THAT THEY HAVE EYES IN THE BACK
OF THEIR HEAD.

31:59.792 --> 32:01.753
HE LITERALLY HAS THEM TATTOOED
ON THE BACK OF HIS HEAD.

32:01.836 --> 32:02.962
IT'S A PRETTY SOLID TATTOO.

32:06.591 --> 32:09.427
- MARK.

32:09.510 --> 32:11.846
- IT'S KIND OF JUST A HARSH,
STIFF IMAGE.

32:11.929 --> 32:13.640
THE WAY THIS SKULL AND THIS ROSE
GO TOGETHER,

32:13.723 --> 32:15.683
THE PART WHERE IT CHANGE
IN TO THE FLOWER,

32:15.767 --> 32:17.101
IT JUST DOESN'T REALLY FLOW
AND MAKE A LOT OF SENSE

32:17.185 --> 32:19.937
WITH THE DIRECTION
OF THE REST OF THE ROSE.

32:20.021 --> 32:22.023
IT'S GOT A LITTLE BIT
OF A WEIRD PLACEMENT.

32:22.106 --> 32:24.233
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S WHISPERING
SOMETHING IN HER EAR.

32:24.317 --> 32:26.361
OR DEPENDING ON WHAT ANGLE
YOU LOOK AT IT FROM,

32:26.444 --> 32:28.196
IT'S KIND OF TUCKED
BEHIND HER EAR A LITTLE BIT.

32:28.279 --> 32:30.198
I KIND OF WISH THERE WAS
A LITTLE MORE SEPARATION THERE.

32:30.281 --> 32:31.532
- I WAS TAKING THAT
INTO CONSIDERATION

32:31.616 --> 32:32.533
WHEN I WAS PUTTING IT ON THERE.

32:32.617 --> 32:34.202
I WAS THINKING MORE
ABOUT HOW GIRLS

32:34.285 --> 32:36.371
LIKE THEIR EARS BIT AND STUFF.
EVERY GIRL LIKES THAT.

32:36.454 --> 32:38.873
- I DON'T MIND THE PLACEMENT.
I THINK IT'S A STRONG DRAWING.

32:38.956 --> 32:40.333
YOU SHADED IT TOUGH.

32:40.416 --> 32:41.709
PURPLE'S ONE OF MY LEAST
FAVORITE COLORS IN TATTOOS,

32:41.793 --> 32:44.379
BUT THIS WEARS WELL ON HER.

32:44.462 --> 32:45.380
JUST BE CLEAR ON YOUR DESIGN,

32:45.463 --> 32:47.256
BECAUSE NOW IT COULD
JUST BE A THING

32:47.340 --> 32:49.133
WHERE I GET OUTVOTED,
AND YOU'RE OUT OF HERE.

32:53.179 --> 32:54.097
- CRIS.

32:58.810 --> 32:59.894
THIS 3/4 VIEW...

32:59.977 --> 33:00.728
- I DIDN'T WANT TO GO
THE FRONT VIEW

33:00.812 --> 33:02.021
JUST BECAUSE, PERSONALLY,

33:02.105 --> 33:04.148
I JUST DON'T LIKE THE WAY
IT LOOKS.

33:04.232 --> 33:05.483
IT'S SO COMMON.

33:05.566 --> 33:06.943
I ALWAYS LOVED THE 3/4-VIEW
SKULL.

33:07.026 --> 33:08.403
- I LIKE THE PLACEMENT.

33:08.486 --> 33:10.655
I THINK IT'S INTERESTING TO HAVE
IT NOT JUST BE STRAIGHT.

33:10.738 --> 33:11.739
VERY FEMININE--

33:11.823 --> 33:13.616
IT HAS A NICE,
BEAUTIFUL TOUCH TO IT.

33:13.700 --> 33:15.910
THE ACTUAL DETAIL IN THE JEWEL
IN THE CENTER

33:15.993 --> 33:16.661
AND THE BEADS AROUND--

33:16.744 --> 33:18.788
I LIKE HOW THEY'RE DARK,

33:18.871 --> 33:20.081
BUT WITH JUST A LITTLE BIT
OF HIGHLIGHT.

33:20.164 --> 33:22.291
ONE OF YOUR SMOOTHEST TATTOOS
SO FAR, MAN.

33:22.375 --> 33:25.253
- THANK YOU.

33:25.336 --> 33:27.880
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS, WHO HAD
THE BEST TATTOO OF THE DAY?

33:27.964 --> 33:29.340
- FOR ME, THE ONE
THAT STANDS OUT BEING

33:29.424 --> 33:30.633
OVERALL THE CLEANEST TATTOO
IS CLEEN'S.

33:30.717 --> 33:31.759
- IF I HAD TO WEAR ONE,

33:31.843 --> 33:32.760
I'D WEAR AARON'S.

33:32.844 --> 33:35.430
IF I HAD TO VOTE ON PLACEMENT,

33:35.513 --> 33:36.806
I'D GO WITH CLEEN.

33:36.889 --> 33:37.890
- I REALLY LIKE ERIK.

33:37.974 --> 33:38.599
I LOVE THE DETAIL
WITH THE HORNS.

33:38.683 --> 33:40.393
IT'S SOLID.

33:40.476 --> 33:41.561
- FINAL ANSWER.

33:41.644 --> 33:42.937
- CLEEN.
- ERIK.

33:43.020 --> 33:44.439
- CLEEN.
- I'LL GO WITH CLEEN.

33:44.522 --> 33:46.357
WINNER OF BEST TATTOO OF THE DAY
IS CLEEN.

33:48.693 --> 33:50.945
- THIS CHALLENGE, I THINK
EVERYBODY STEPPED UP.

33:51.028 --> 33:53.573
IT'S JUST GETTING TO THAT POINT
TO WHERE LITTLE MISTAKES

33:53.656 --> 33:54.866
ARE GONNA MAKE BIG DIFFERENCES.

33:54.949 --> 33:57.618
I HONESTLY BELIEVE
THAT FROM THIS POINT OUT,

33:57.702 --> 34:00.496
A GOOD TATTOO IS GOING HOME
EVERY TIME.

34:00.580 --> 34:03.291
- THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
IS DELIBERATING RIGHT NOW,

34:03.374 --> 34:06.294
AND THEIR VOTE WILL PUT
ONE ARTIST UP FOR ELIMINATION.

34:06.377 --> 34:07.587
HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT,

34:07.670 --> 34:09.464
AND WE'LL CALL YOU BACK
WHEN WE HAVE A DECISION.

34:14.719 --> 34:16.262
- LAST TIME I WAS HERE,

34:16.344 --> 34:17.722
I WENT HOME IN SIXTH PLACE.

34:17.804 --> 34:19.514
I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO DO BETTER
THAN THAT

34:19.599 --> 34:20.641
OR WIN THIS DAMN THING.

34:20.725 --> 34:22.101
I WANT TO BE THE INK MASTER.

34:22.185 --> 34:23.518
- NOT EASY ON YOU
IN THAT CRITIQUE.

34:23.603 --> 34:24.562
- [scoffs]

34:24.645 --> 34:25.980
SUCKED.

34:26.063 --> 34:27.940
I ALWAYS SEE MY MISTAKES
BEFORE I GO DOWN THERE,

34:28.024 --> 34:29.484
AND IT SICKENS ME,
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, DUDE?

34:29.567 --> 34:31.110
I KNOW I DON'T TATTOO LIKE THAT
ALL THE TIME.

34:31.194 --> 34:32.695
- THAT WAS ONE OF MY BIGGEST
PROBLEMS, LIKE,

34:32.779 --> 34:34.362
WHEN I DID THE TATTOOS THAT
I GOT THE WORST CRITIQUES ON

34:34.447 --> 34:35.947
IT WAS LIKE, "[bleep],
I WOULDN'T DO THIS AT HOME."

34:36.032 --> 34:37.283
- THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

34:37.366 --> 34:38.409
- IT'S NOT ANOTHER DAY
AT THE OFFICE.

34:38.493 --> 34:39.368
- THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

34:39.452 --> 34:40.620
THE COMPETITION SETS IN,

34:40.703 --> 34:42.288
AND ALL THESE OTHER ELEMENTS
COME INTO PLAY.

34:42.371 --> 34:43.623
- BASICALLY, I CAN'T--I CAN'T
RELATE WITH YOU GUYS

34:43.706 --> 34:45.500
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU HAVE BAD OUTLINING

34:45.583 --> 34:46.667
OR BAD SATURATION.

34:46.751 --> 34:48.835
THOSE ARE THINGS THAT YOU DO
EVERY SINGLE DAY

34:48.920 --> 34:49.962
FOR THE PAST...

34:50.045 --> 34:51.380
HOW MANY YEARS?
- SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

34:51.464 --> 34:53.049
THAT WE'RE ALL JUST [bleep]
AROUND HERE?

34:53.132 --> 34:55.134
- I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU GUYS ARE
[bleep] UP OVER STUPID [bleep].

34:55.217 --> 34:56.803
ONCE YOU'RE HERE,
EVERYBODY JUST, LIKE,

34:56.886 --> 34:58.679
FORGETS HOW TO DO EVERYTHING.

34:58.763 --> 35:00.848
YOU'RE, LIKE, "UH, I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO PACK COLOR.

35:00.932 --> 35:02.141
UH, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS DOING."

35:02.225 --> 35:04.519
- THIS COMPETITION ISN'T
JUST ABOUT TATTOOING.

35:04.602 --> 35:06.020
THIS IS ABOUT MENTAL STATE.

35:06.103 --> 35:07.313
THIS IS ABOUT HOW YOU DEAL

35:07.396 --> 35:08.856
WITH LIVING
WITH ALL THESE DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

35:08.940 --> 35:12.193
- THE TATTOOING PART'S EASY.

35:12.276 --> 35:14.403
- EVERYBODY HAS A FALL...

35:14.487 --> 35:16.197
AND EVERYBODY TRIPS
ONCE IN A WHILE.

35:16.280 --> 35:20.076
GET READY FOR YOURS, TOO,
BECAUSE IT CAN HAPPEN.

35:26.958 --> 35:30.169
- ALL RIGHT, TODAY WE'RE TESTING
PLACEMENT WITH HEAD TATTOOS.

35:30.253 --> 35:32.505
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG;
I'M THINKING JASON CLAY DUNN

35:32.588 --> 35:34.006
HAS FOUND HIMSELF
IN THE BOTTOM TODAY.

35:34.090 --> 35:35.383
- YES.
- THESE LITTLE LINES

35:35.466 --> 35:37.051
{\an8}THAT COME OFF
THE BOTTOM OF THIS TATTOO--

35:37.134 --> 35:39.512
{\an8}ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO BE
HAIRS OR STRINGS?

35:39.595 --> 35:42.473
ONE THING WE ARE SURE OF IS
THEY ARE [bleep] LITTLE LINES.

35:42.557 --> 35:43.724
- AND ON TOP OF THAT,

35:43.808 --> 35:45.601
IT ACTUALLY LOOKED LIKE
AN UNFINISHED PIECE,

35:45.685 --> 35:47.979
BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK
ACROSS THE FOREHEAD,

35:48.062 --> 35:49.522
IT'S AS IF HE RAN OUT OF TIME.

35:49.605 --> 35:51.732
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DONE
UP UNTIL THIS POINT,

35:51.816 --> 35:53.484
BUT WHAT I'VE SEEN IS SOMETHING

35:53.568 --> 35:56.779
THAT WOULD HAVE A PERSON
SITTING AT HOME.

35:56.863 --> 35:59.073
- DON HAS FOUND HIMSELF
IN THE BOTTOM TODAY.

35:59.156 --> 36:01.784
- THIS TATTOO JUST HAS A REAL
BUBBLEGUM FEEL FOR ME.

36:01.868 --> 36:03.995
THE FACT THAT IT'S
SATURATED BRIGHT GREEN

36:04.078 --> 36:05.955
AND YELLOW EVERYWHERE--
IT'S JUST ROUGH.

36:06.038 --> 36:07.957
- IF YOU HAVE A TATTOOER
THAT CAN DRAW,

36:08.040 --> 36:08.666
THIS TATTOO COULD BE
COOL AS [bleep].

36:08.749 --> 36:11.586
- DON--HE HAS MAXED OUT.

36:11.669 --> 36:13.754
- LET'S TALK ABOUT
AARON'S TATTOO.

36:13.838 --> 36:15.506
- THE ROSES COME OFF OF THE EAR

36:15.590 --> 36:17.550
AND RUN ONTO
THE SIDE OF THE HEAD.

36:17.633 --> 36:19.427
FOR ME, THAT'S A TERRIBLE SHAPE.

36:19.510 --> 36:21.137
THE ROSES LOOK SO JUVENILE

36:21.220 --> 36:22.972
THAT IT DOESN'T LOOK
PROFESSIONALLY DONE.

36:23.055 --> 36:24.473
IT LOOKS UGLY.

36:24.557 --> 36:26.642
- ALL RIGHT, SO IT SEEMS LIKE
WE'RE ALL ON BOARD HERE

36:26.726 --> 36:27.602
WITH THE SAME DECISION.

36:27.685 --> 36:29.604
all: YEAH.

36:29.687 --> 36:32.315
{\an8}- WE'RE HERE TO DETERMINE WHO
HAS THE WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

36:32.398 --> 36:35.026
- THIS IS MY TATTOO.
MY ARTIST WAS ERIK.

36:35.109 --> 36:37.153
- I DON'T LIKE THE PENTAGRAM.

36:37.236 --> 36:38.779
- WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THE PENTAGRAM?

36:38.863 --> 36:39.906
- IT'S A LITTLE CROOKED UP TOP.

36:39.989 --> 36:41.574
- IT'S NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE PERFECT.

36:41.657 --> 36:43.534
- THAT HARD LINE RIGHT BELOW
THE NOSE CAVITY

36:43.618 --> 36:45.119
LOOKS SLIGHTLY TILTED.

36:45.202 --> 36:47.872
- THOSE LITTLE HORNS AND
THE EYES ARE REALLY CARTOONY,

36:47.955 --> 36:50.917
AND THEN THE REST OF IT
IS JUST DARK AND BLENDED IN.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.335
- IT'S NOT A MASTER QUALITY
TATTOO.

36:54.754 --> 36:57.214
- THAT'S MY TATTOO,
AND MY ARTIST WAS AARON.

36:57.298 --> 36:59.467
- THAT TOP FLOWER,
IT LOOKS LIKE A SPIRAL,

36:59.550 --> 37:02.511
AND IT'S COMING OUT LIKE
HE WAS COLORING OUT OF LINE.

37:02.595 --> 37:04.305
LOOKS LIKE A BIG LOLLIPOP.
- [laughs]

37:04.388 --> 37:06.307
- THERE'S A LOT OF WHITE
IN THE FLOWERS.

37:06.390 --> 37:08.059
- YEAH.
- IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE THAT.

37:08.142 --> 37:09.685
- THIS IS <i> INK MASTER...</i>
- RIGHT.

37:09.769 --> 37:10.311
- IT HAS TO BE 110%.

37:12.355 --> 37:15.733
- THAT'S MY TATTOO.
MY ARTIST WAS JASON.

37:15.816 --> 37:16.525
- YEAH, I DON'T LIKE IT, MAN.

37:16.609 --> 37:17.652
I SEE THE CHEEKBONE OVER THERE,

37:17.735 --> 37:19.654
UNDERNEATH THE EYE
IT STICKS OUT MORE.

37:19.737 --> 37:21.739
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT
A ZIPPER IN YOUR NOSE

37:21.822 --> 37:22.823
AND IT'S NOT PORTIONED RIGHT.

37:22.907 --> 37:25.117
- THE SYMMETRY
DOESN'T EXACTLY ADD UP.

37:25.201 --> 37:26.911
- YEAH, IT'S REALLY HARD
TO READ.

37:26.994 --> 37:27.995
- I THINK JASON REALLY
SCREWED THE POOCH.

37:28.079 --> 37:30.831
- HAVE WE REACHED A DECISION?

37:30.915 --> 37:31.374
all: YES.

37:33.584 --> 37:35.544
- I'M GOING DOWN THERE,
BUT I'M NOT LEAVING, DUDE.

37:35.628 --> 37:38.714
I'M GONNA FIGHT EVERY STEP
OF THE [bleep] WAY.

37:38.798 --> 37:40.424
- WE SHALL SEE.

37:43.427 --> 37:45.304
- ALL RIGHT, IN THE BOTTOM...

37:47.098 --> 37:47.765
WE GOT DON

37:47.848 --> 37:50.768
AND JASON.

37:50.851 --> 37:53.396
WE'LL SEE YOU AND EVERYBODY ELSE
DOWNSTAIRS.

37:56.065 --> 37:58.275
- NOW I GOT TO DEAL WITH THIS.
- YOU GUYS READY?

37:58.359 --> 37:58.442
- NO.

38:09.954 --> 38:13.666
- TODAY YOU HAD TO TATTOO
A SKULL ON YOUR CANVAS' SKULL.

38:13.749 --> 38:16.002
JASON AND DON,

38:16.085 --> 38:19.964
ANY ONE OF YOU COULD BE
JUSTIFIABLY ELIMINATED.

38:20.047 --> 38:23.426
JASON, YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY DETERMINED

38:23.509 --> 38:26.387
THAT YOU HAD THE WORST TATTOO
OF THE DAY.

38:26.470 --> 38:28.806
- THROUGH THE LAYMAN'S EYES
OF ART,

38:28.889 --> 38:31.392
THEY PROBABLY WOULDN'T
UNDERSTAND A DESIGN LIKE THIS.

38:31.475 --> 38:32.727
IF IT'S UNRECOGNIZABLE
TO THEM,

38:32.810 --> 38:34.562
RIGHT AWAY, THEY'RE JUST GONNA
PICK THAT ONE.

38:34.645 --> 38:36.397
- WHETHER IT'S FROM THE CANVAS
POINT OF VIEW

38:36.480 --> 38:38.733
OR FROM THE JUDGES'
POINT OF VIEW,

38:38.816 --> 38:40.776
THIS TATTOO IS HARD TO READ.

38:40.860 --> 38:42.028
- AT THE END OF THE DAY,

38:42.111 --> 38:44.613
YOU PUT BELLS AND WHISTLES
INTO SOMETHING THAT,

38:44.697 --> 38:47.074
QUITE FRANKLY,
SHOULD'VE BEEN SIMPLE.

38:47.158 --> 38:49.076
- I GO UP AND I COME DOWN.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.245
THIS WAS ONE OF MY DOWNS.
I'LL HAVE AN UP.

38:51.328 --> 38:53.205
I HONESTLY FEEL THAT
I'M AS GOOD OR BETTER

38:53.289 --> 38:55.166
THAN ANY OF THESE ARTISTS
SITTING HERE.

38:56.417 --> 38:57.752
- DON.

38:57.835 --> 39:00.921
- YOUR DRAWING IS NOT UP TO PAR
TO WIN THIS THING.

39:01.005 --> 39:03.340
IT DOESN'T SAY THAT YOU KNOW
HOW TO DRAW A SKULL.

39:03.424 --> 39:04.633
IT DOESN'T SAY THAT YOU KNOW
HOW TO SHADE A SKULL.

39:04.717 --> 39:07.386
- I MEAN, I THINK...
- THIS DRAWING DOES NOT HAVE--

39:07.470 --> 39:09.096
- I'M ON THE RISE.
- YEAH, BUT--

39:09.180 --> 39:11.932
- I'M ON THE RISE, AND HE HAS
A HISTORY OF DRAWING TATTOOS

39:12.016 --> 39:12.641
THAT YOU CAN'T READ.

39:12.725 --> 39:13.851
- HOLD ON.
THIS--

39:13.934 --> 39:15.936
- THE DRAGON YOU DID--
COULDN'T READ IT.

39:16.020 --> 39:17.438
EVERY TATTOO I DO
GETS BETTER AND BETTER.

39:17.521 --> 39:19.482
- WHEN ARE YOU ON THE RISE?
- EVERY TATTOO I DO

39:19.565 --> 39:20.983
HAS GOTTEN BETTER AND BETTER.
- NO, YOU'RE NOT ON THE RISE.

39:21.067 --> 39:22.610
- YOURS ARE GETTING WORSE
AND WORSE.

39:22.693 --> 39:24.487
- YOU HAVE BEEN CONSISTENTLY
IN THE BOTTOM THE WHOLE TIME.

39:24.570 --> 39:27.114
I'D RATHER PUT MY MONEY ON A GUY
LIKE ME THAT'S BEEN HIGH AND LOW

39:27.198 --> 39:30.659
THAN A GUY WHO HAS BEEN
CONSISTENTLY DOWN.

39:30.743 --> 39:31.535
- DEANGELO, LET ME ASK YOU;

39:31.619 --> 39:33.788
AS A COMPETITOR, WHAT'S BETTER,

39:33.871 --> 39:35.539
TO RIDE THE MIDDLE,
OR TO HAVE HIGHS AND LOWS?

39:35.623 --> 39:38.751
- RIDING THE MIDDLE
ONLY GETS YOU AVERAGE.

39:38.834 --> 39:40.294
RIDING THE HIGHS AND LOWS,

39:40.377 --> 39:41.879
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE MORE HIGHS
THAN LOWS,

39:41.962 --> 39:45.091
SO THEREFORE
YOU COME OUT ON TOP.

39:45.174 --> 39:47.259
- THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED.

39:50.304 --> 39:51.639
DON,

39:51.722 --> 39:53.724
YOU DO NOT HAVE WHAT IT TAKES
TO BE INK MASTER.

39:53.808 --> 39:57.770
- DON, YOU HAVE NOT BLOWN ME
AWAY WITH A DRAWING.

39:57.853 --> 39:59.772
HOW CAN YOU BE INK MASTER?

39:59.855 --> 40:02.817
- PLEASE PACK YOUR MACHINES
AND CLOSE SHOP.

40:04.944 --> 40:07.196
- [exhales]

40:09.156 --> 40:10.241
- I'M PISSED.

40:10.324 --> 40:12.409
I CAN OUTDRAW ANYBODY
IN THIS COMPETITION.

40:12.493 --> 40:14.829
I FEEL LIKE THE TITLE OF
INK MASTER WAS RIGHT AT MY GRASP

40:14.912 --> 40:16.789
AND THEN IT WAS RIPPED AWAY
FROM ME.

40:20.459 --> 40:22.002
announcer: ON THE NEXT EPISODE
OF <i> INK MASTER...</i>

40:22.086 --> 40:24.046
- CONGRATULATIONS.

40:24.130 --> 40:26.465
ALL OF YOU HAVE DEFEATED
YOUR RIVALS.

40:26.549 --> 40:28.509
- THERE'S ONLY SIX PEOPLE LEFT
IN THIS COMPETITION.

40:28.592 --> 40:29.844
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

40:29.927 --> 40:31.303
THAT I BEAT EVERYBODY
IN THE HOUSE AT LEAST ONCE.

40:31.387 --> 40:33.889
DING, DING, DING, IT'S ON!
- OH, IT'S OVER ALREADY.

40:33.973 --> 40:35.349
- OH!
- OH!

40:35.432 --> 40:37.309
- THIS IS YOUR WAY OF TRYING
TO GET IN MY [bleep] HEAD.

40:37.393 --> 40:40.229
- IF EITHER ONE OF YOU [bleep]
PIECES OF [bleep] HAD MY CANVAS,

40:40.312 --> 40:41.522
IT WOULD'VE
BEEN A [bleep] TURD.

40:41.605 --> 40:44.442
- UNFORTUNATELY, WHEN YOU HAVE
THAT MANY POOR OUTINGS,

40:44.525 --> 40:45.401
THEY CATCH UP.

40:45.484 --> 40:46.610
- I WOULD SAY IT'S TERRIBLE.

40:46.694 --> 40:48.237
- IT MAKES IT ALMOST LOOK
GHOULISH.

40:48.320 --> 40:49.655
- IT WAS METICULOUS AND TEDIOUS,
AND I SPENT A LOT OF TIME--

40:49.738 --> 40:52.366
- BUT THERE'S NOTHING
THAT LOOKS METICULOUS.

40:52.449 --> 40:53.576
- THAT CAN BE THE KISS OF DEATH.
