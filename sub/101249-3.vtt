09:25.523 --> 09:27.650
Starfleet scum!

09:27.733 --> 09:30.069
-Vendome!
-(Mariner grunts)

09:33.531 --> 09:34.907
(horn blows)

09:37.785 --> 09:39.704
There's too many of them.
Fall back!

09:39.787 --> 09:41.455
Come on.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.169
-Oh, God, I'm gonna die!
-We live on a spaceship.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.588
-(shouts)
-Nobody is dying
from a spear wound.

09:50.631 --> 09:51.966
Crystals!

09:52.049 --> 09:54.176
-Oh. Hate when this happens.
-Oh!

09:54.260 --> 09:56.178
Let's just stun them
and get out of here!

09:56.262 --> 09:58.556
Negative, we just signed them
into the Federation.

09:58.639 --> 10:00.516
What this calls for
is some classic

10:00.599 --> 10:02.310
Jack Ransom peace brokering.

10:02.393 --> 10:03.477
Are you out of your mind?

10:03.561 --> 10:04.645
Watch and learn.

10:04.729 --> 10:06.022
This is gonna be awesome.

10:06.105 --> 10:08.357
Attention, Gelrakians,
I am Commander Jack--

10:08.441 --> 10:10.359
Ooh! (screams)

10:10.443 --> 10:12.528
All right, that was awesome.

10:12.611 --> 10:14.864
-(all grunting)
-Ah, circled by spears.

10:14.947 --> 10:17.199
This is a classic.
What am I, Kirk?

10:17.283 --> 10:19.035
Is this the 2260s?
All right.

10:24.290 --> 10:27.209
Whoa, oh, hey, hey!

10:27.293 --> 10:28.711
Uh, we got acid here.

10:28.794 --> 10:30.838
Excuse me!

10:30.921 --> 10:33.841
(growling):
Rutherford.

10:33.924 --> 10:35.217
Aah, Tendi, what the hell?

10:35.301 --> 10:36.385
Can't talk, got to work.

10:36.469 --> 10:37.386
I'm compiling.

10:37.470 --> 10:38.971
What? (groans)

10:39.055 --> 10:41.349
The impulse manifold needs
to be degaussed again.

10:41.432 --> 10:43.225
I have to assist with a surgery,

10:43.309 --> 10:45.895
and I honestly can't remember
which deck sickbay is on!

10:45.978 --> 10:47.730
-Uh, 26?
-Is that--?

10:47.813 --> 10:49.523
Do we have that many?

10:49.607 --> 10:51.025
COMPUTER:
Enter security code.

10:51.108 --> 10:53.444
-I'm waiting, Ensign.
-Sorry, Captain.

10:53.527 --> 10:54.904
Something's wrong
with the console.

10:54.987 --> 10:57.281
Move! I'll do it myself.

10:57.365 --> 10:59.867
Lieutenant Shaxs,
any word from the away team?

10:59.950 --> 11:03.412
Captain, the sensors have
picked up Gelrakian ships

11:03.496 --> 11:05.122
approaching
off the starboard bow.

11:05.206 --> 11:06.165
What? (groans)

11:06.248 --> 11:07.083
On screen.

11:07.166 --> 11:08.959
(stammers)
Are we supposed to be hosting

11:09.043 --> 11:10.252
a welcome dinner or something?

11:10.336 --> 11:12.213
Captain,
they're locking phasers.

11:12.296 --> 11:13.464
(chuckling) Really?

11:13.547 --> 11:14.632
Raise shields.

11:14.715 --> 11:15.925
(computer beeping)

11:16.008 --> 11:17.927
-Shaxs?
-I'm trying, Captain.

11:18.010 --> 11:19.637
Something's wrong
with the controls.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.597
Ah, stupid controls.

11:21.680 --> 11:24.392
Do I have to run
this whole ship myself?

11:24.475 --> 11:25.726
(grunts)

11:25.810 --> 11:26.769
SHAXS:
They've launched boarding pods!

11:26.852 --> 11:27.895
Red alert!

11:31.232 --> 11:34.443
Repel all intruders,
but do not use it as an excuse

11:34.527 --> 11:35.945
to stop doing
what you are doing.

11:36.028 --> 11:37.613
I want to stay on track
and on time.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.615
It's called
multi-tasking, people.

11:39.698 --> 11:41.909
They do it on the Enterprise
all the time.

11:41.992 --> 11:44.078
I don't want to hear any
complaining, I only want to hear

11:44.161 --> 11:46.163
repelling of intruders and
people getting their work done!

11:46.247 --> 11:48.749
(grunting)

11:48.833 --> 11:51.419
Swords and spears--
how did these guys get on board?

11:55.172 --> 11:57.466
MARINER:
Hey, guy.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.468
Hey, guy?

11:59.552 --> 12:01.303
Hey, guy, is this what
you wanted to do with your life?

12:01.387 --> 12:03.514
Just capture people-- is that
what you dreamt of when you were

12:03.597 --> 12:05.808
a little whatever-you-are?
Are you fulfilled by that?

12:05.891 --> 12:07.810
-Yes.
-Wow, all right, uh...

12:07.893 --> 12:09.854
well, do you know what,
that means you're lame.

12:09.937 --> 12:11.981
-You're a loser.
-Hey, keep it down!

12:12.064 --> 12:14.358
I'm writing a speech that will
convince them to let us go.

12:14.442 --> 12:17.445
A speech, seriously?
Permission to speak freely.

12:17.528 --> 12:18.779
You always speak freely.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.322
Nobody can stop you
from speaking freely.

12:20.406 --> 12:21.657
All right, you know
what you've got going on?

12:21.740 --> 12:23.659
You have broad shoulders
and shiny hair

12:23.742 --> 12:25.870
and you talk a good game,
but when it comes to actually

12:25.953 --> 12:28.164
doing the job-- the job--
you don't have it.

12:28.247 --> 12:31.167
I'm calling bull(bleep)
on your whole thing here, sir.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.502
You're so busy breaking protocol
that you never look ahead.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.504
One of these days you're going
to get someone killed, Ensign.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.006
With all due respect, sir,

12:37.089 --> 12:38.716
my friends aren't trapped
in an alien prison,

12:38.799 --> 12:40.342
your team is.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.678
That's not my team,
it's our team.

12:42.761 --> 12:44.805
But I guess
you don't think that way.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.849
Here we go, show time.
(clears throat)

12:46.932 --> 12:49.477
We may come
from different worlds,

12:49.560 --> 12:52.646
-but on the inside we are all--
-GERNBA: Silence, Starfleet!

12:52.730 --> 12:55.900
You are being held responsible
for the lies of the Federation.

12:55.983 --> 12:58.068
Your trial will be by combat.

12:58.152 --> 12:59.945
Yes, now we're talking!

13:00.029 --> 13:01.822
And by "talking," of course,
I mean "fighting."

13:01.906 --> 13:05.201
One of you must face
our greatest champion, Vindor.

13:05.284 --> 13:08.496
Usually we start the battle and
Vindor steps out of the shadows

13:08.579 --> 13:10.539
and it's super intimidating,
but he's here,

13:10.623 --> 13:13.542
so I'm just gonna show him
to you right now.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.669
Vindor.

13:15.753 --> 13:17.671
If you win, we let you go.

13:17.755 --> 13:21.050
If you lose, you'll be dead
and your away team

13:21.133 --> 13:24.053
will be crushed
by the adjudication geode.

13:24.136 --> 13:26.096
Crystals!

13:28.140 --> 13:30.601
Okay, I'm looking at
a lot of blank faces here.

13:30.684 --> 13:32.937
An adjudication geode is
a special type

13:33.020 --> 13:35.439
of constitutional crystal we use
to legally smoosh our criminals.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.066
Here is your battle blade.

13:37.149 --> 13:39.693
You have one hour to choose

13:39.777 --> 13:42.238
who gets the honor
of being slaughtered by Vindor.

13:42.321 --> 13:44.323
If you can't decide, we will--

13:44.406 --> 13:45.407
-I'll do it!
-I'll do it! Give it to me!

13:45.491 --> 13:46.534
-Yo, I touched it first.
-Give it, come--

13:46.617 --> 13:47.535
-Tell him! No, me!
-No, mine!

13:47.618 --> 13:48.452
You do realize you're
fighting over who gets

13:48.536 --> 13:49.954
to be chopped in half
by Vindor, right?

13:50.037 --> 13:50.913
-Me, dibs!
-No, I said me,

13:50.996 --> 13:51.747
-I touched it first.
-Come on. Give it to me.

13:51.830 --> 13:53.582
-Jack Ransom-- it's mine!
-No! No!

13:56.961 --> 13:59.255
(female screams in distance)

13:59.338 --> 14:01.090
(humming)

14:01.173 --> 14:03.217
Aah!

14:03.300 --> 14:06.428
Translation--
"Bark hugging root smoochers"?

14:06.512 --> 14:09.056
What the heck
got these guys so wound up?

14:09.139 --> 14:11.433
Gah, this is totally gonna
mess up my schedule.

14:11.517 --> 14:13.269
(grunts)

14:13.352 --> 14:14.645
-Don't move, human!
-(gasps)

14:14.728 --> 14:15.771
We have you surrounded.

14:15.854 --> 14:17.690
Yeah, but I-I have a phaser.

14:17.773 --> 14:19.567
(gasps, grunts)

14:19.650 --> 14:21.235
These guys are lightweights.

14:21.318 --> 14:23.737
This is what
the red alert's about?

14:23.821 --> 14:27.241
Captain, I just phasered
some Gelrakians?

14:29.535 --> 14:32.079
-Um, hello?
-Intruder! (muttering)

14:32.162 --> 14:33.622
(grunts)

14:33.706 --> 14:35.791
Oh, it's just that huffy ensign.

14:35.874 --> 14:37.167
-Sorry, Brimler.
-I'm not huffy.

14:37.251 --> 14:38.586
Why aren't you at your post?

14:38.669 --> 14:39.670
We wouldn't even be
in this situation

14:39.753 --> 14:41.297
if you weren't slacking off.

14:41.380 --> 14:42.464
I'm not!

14:42.548 --> 14:45.301
Damn it!
We're 15 minutes behind.

14:45.384 --> 14:47.469
Our entire schedule is going
to be off for the month.

14:47.553 --> 14:49.471
Wait a minute-- clocks,

14:49.555 --> 14:51.682
time, schedules.

14:51.765 --> 14:54.602
You guys are under
the strict scheduling, too?

14:54.685 --> 14:56.895
I have to be-- I'm manning
every station on my own.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.480
What? No, no, no, no, no.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.024
This is all wrong--
you're the captain!

15:00.107 --> 15:03.027
I need us working harder
and faster and stricter!

15:03.110 --> 15:05.112
-(heavy pounding)
-GELRAKIAN: Where are you
hiding your crystals?!

15:05.195 --> 15:06.655
We don't have any crystals!

15:06.739 --> 15:08.991
I mean we do have dilithium,
but we're not giving you those.

15:09.074 --> 15:12.620
-(grunting)
-(exclaims)

15:12.703 --> 15:15.164
Trial by combat is
my responsibility.

15:15.247 --> 15:17.833
I'm ranking officer, I'll be
fighting Vindor, end of story!

15:17.916 --> 15:19.460
Rank means nothing right now.

15:19.543 --> 15:21.337
(gasps)
Rank means everything always!

15:21.420 --> 15:23.172
You know what, I do get off
on breaking protocol.

15:23.255 --> 15:25.507
I'm good at exploring
strange new worlds,

15:25.591 --> 15:28.010
solving space mysteries
and kicking asses.

15:28.093 --> 15:30.346
Protocol is for people that
need to be told what to do,

15:30.429 --> 15:32.348
which I don't.
See this bad boy?

15:32.431 --> 15:33.682
Tentacle guy, bunch of arms.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.351
Stabbed me
with a barnacle blade.

15:35.434 --> 15:38.812
Check it out-- Magus III,
Nanibia Prime, Scottsdale.

15:38.896 --> 15:40.022
That was a mess.

15:40.105 --> 15:42.566
I earned every one
in high-concept fights

15:42.650 --> 15:43.692
just like this one.

15:43.776 --> 15:44.818
So? What do you got?

15:44.902 --> 15:47.279
-Let me see your scars.
-You know I don't have any.

15:47.363 --> 15:48.530
Because you play it safe.

15:48.614 --> 15:51.241
You said it-- that's our team
under that geode.

15:51.325 --> 15:54.078
Let me do what I'm good at,
let me save them.

15:54.161 --> 15:57.039
Sometimes you have to do
what's wrong to survive.

15:57.122 --> 15:58.540
You're right.

15:58.624 --> 16:00.542
-(blade slashes)
-(Mariner screams)

16:00.626 --> 16:03.253
What the (bleep)?!
Ah, God, oh!

16:03.337 --> 16:05.756
You stabbed me in the foot
with a battle blade!

16:05.839 --> 16:08.217
I'd rather die than let you
put your life on the line.

16:08.300 --> 16:09.551
Oh, you are such a psycho!

16:09.635 --> 16:10.678
What are you doing?

16:10.761 --> 16:12.221
Ow! Why?

16:12.304 --> 16:14.223
I'm the first officer
of a Federation starship,

16:14.306 --> 16:15.724
and your commander.

16:15.808 --> 16:18.143
And nobody crushes my team.

16:18.227 --> 16:19.687
Let's do this!

16:19.770 --> 16:22.398
CROWD (chanting):
Vindor! Vindor!

16:22.481 --> 16:24.108
Vindor! Vindor!

16:24.191 --> 16:25.818
Vindor!

16:25.901 --> 16:27.194
(cheering, shouting)

16:29.029 --> 16:30.864
-Vindor?
-Come on, big guy.

16:30.948 --> 16:34.034
I only need my hands
for this one.

16:34.118 --> 16:35.828
-(roars)
-(grunting)

16:38.038 --> 16:39.581
(chuckles)

16:39.665 --> 16:40.749
(scoffs)

16:40.833 --> 16:42.418
(martial arts grunting)

16:42.501 --> 16:43.919
Ha-ha-ha! Yah!

16:44.002 --> 16:45.879
(grunts)

16:45.963 --> 16:47.965
-Ha-ha!
-(crowd shouting)

16:48.048 --> 16:49.883
-Double-fist punch!
-Oh!

16:50.884 --> 16:53.053
(cracks neck, grunts)

16:53.137 --> 16:55.264
Whoa, that was actually
kind of hot.

16:55.347 --> 16:57.224
Ugh! Get it together, Mariner,
get it together.

16:57.307 --> 16:59.059
You are not into this.
Come on.

16:59.143 --> 17:00.269
(Vindor and Ransom grunt)

17:05.691 --> 17:07.568
(Gelrakian chuckles)

17:07.651 --> 17:09.445
Let's see how much
those Federation wood lovers

17:09.528 --> 17:11.947
like our crystal graffiti.
Ha-ha-ha!

17:12.030 --> 17:13.949
(fierce yelling)

17:15.534 --> 17:17.244
I-I need to get back to comms.

17:17.327 --> 17:18.954
-Captain, listen to me...
-Don't touch me!

17:19.038 --> 17:21.498
This is all my fault, thinking
I belong at a peace summit

17:21.582 --> 17:23.292
when I can't even keep
my own ship together.

17:23.375 --> 17:24.793
What? Captain, no.
You did nothing wrong.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.295
Your schedules, your rules--

17:26.378 --> 17:28.047
this has been
the greatest week of my life.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.381
You run the tightest ship
in Starfleet.

17:29.465 --> 17:30.966
Captain, we need to act now!

17:31.049 --> 17:33.135
"Tightest ship."
Then why is it falling apart?

17:33.218 --> 17:34.803
Because not everyone is
a Boimler.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.805
This crew has their limits.
They're only human.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.474
Well, and Vulcan.
And Orion.

17:38.557 --> 17:40.142
There's that Benzite guy
in Tactical...

17:40.225 --> 17:41.977
Damn it, man!
If you're trying to inspire

17:42.060 --> 17:44.229
some sort of resolution,

breaking protocol--

20:45.869 --> 20:47.496

Because you ignored me
when I ordered you

21:02.886 --> 21:04.805
to roll down your sleeves.
They're against code.

21:04.888 --> 21:07.057
The sleeve thing?
You're an idiot. (grunts)

-It took the eyes of a child

to see what
we were blind to today, Boimler.

21:31.623 --> 21:33.709
If it wasn't for you,
we would still be following

21:33.792 --> 21:35.252
every little rule in the book.

21:35.335 --> 21:36.712
Wait, is that bad?
'Cause I love rules.

21:36.795 --> 21:38.505
We're instituting
a new ship-wide mandate,

21:38.588 --> 21:41.049
and we're calling it
the "Boimler Effect."

21:41.133 --> 21:42.759
Really? I-I'm honored.

21:42.843 --> 21:44.553
You should be.
The Boimler Effect is about

21:44.636 --> 21:46.388
encouraging shortcuts
and preventing people

21:46.471 --> 21:48.348
from just blindly following
the rules.

21:48.432 --> 21:50.517
From now on, the crew
can build in buffer time

21:50.600 --> 21:51.768
whenever they deem fit.

21:51.852 --> 21:53.520
Congratulations. Dismissed.

21:53.603 --> 21:55.856
Oh. Well, hey,
how about we add a little thing

21:55.939 --> 21:58.066
about how important it is
to blindly follow rules?

21:58.150 --> 22:00.277
If my name is going
to be associated with...

22:00.360 --> 22:02.738
No, the Boimler Effect is
literally the opposite of that.

22:02.821 --> 22:05.407
But I don't know, I don't know
how I feel about that, and...

22:05.490 --> 22:08.035
I-Is it in ink? Is it already
in the system? Is it...

22:08.118 --> 22:09.786
BOIMLER:
Wow, it's on a plaque.

22:09.870 --> 22:12.581
Get back to your station
and do whatever you deem right.

22:12.664 --> 22:14.583

22:14.666 --> 22:17.252
BOIMLER:
I get a whole rule
named after me,

22:17.336 --> 22:19.379
and it's all about
not following rules.

22:19.463 --> 22:21.006
Don't worry about it, man.

22:21.089 --> 22:23.425
They're always making up
new rules no one ever remembers.

22:23.508 --> 22:25.260

will fade, too.

22:25.343 --> 22:26.928

22:31.808 --> 22:34.936

something we will never forget.

So named after the laziest,

22:36.730 --> 22:39.566
most corner-cutting officer
in Starfleet history,

seen here with one of
the great birds of the galaxy.

Anyway, let's move on
to somebody even more important,

22:47.741 --> 22:51.078
