[man]
Well, what do you think?

00:14.325 --> 00:16.158
[whistles]
I think that in my next life

00:16.227 --> 00:17.693
I'm gonna come back as a movie star.

00:17.762 --> 00:19.228
Yeah, look out, gay porn.

00:19.297 --> 00:21.297
Rimshot.
Yeah, that could be your name.

00:21.366 --> 00:22.832
So what, some movie star lives here?

00:22.901 --> 00:24.801
Veronica Deane.
Can you believe it?

00:24.869 --> 00:27.203
No shit.
You like her?

00:27.272 --> 00:29.138
What, as an actress
or for this homicide?

00:29.207 --> 00:30.957
- Both.
- Well, it's been a while

00:31.042 --> 00:32.909
since I've seen her
in anything, but man,

00:32.977 --> 00:35.912
she was incredible in <i> Shanghai Moon.</i>

00:35.980 --> 00:39.048
- Oh, my God, that dress.
- Oh, bejeezles, right?

00:39.117 --> 00:41.417
But as for Tennessee Tuxedo
here, I want to talk to her.

00:41.486 --> 00:43.419
See if she knows who tried
to weight him down--

00:43.488 --> 00:45.021
with an ounce of lead.

00:45.089 --> 00:47.023
Found it on the ground
over there by the table.

00:47.091 --> 00:49.225
- Is it hers?
- Hard to tell with no serial number.

00:49.294 --> 00:51.093
- Probably why they put 'em on there.
- Rimshot.

00:51.162 --> 00:52.428
You should ask Veronica Deane

00:52.497 --> 00:54.297
if her agent reps gay porn stars.

00:54.365 --> 00:55.932
And maybe if she murdered this guy.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.334
- You got a real knack for this.
- Thanks.

00:58.403 --> 01:00.697
But the household staff says she
hasn't been home since yesterday.

01:00.817 --> 01:03.076
- And him?
- They say that as of midnight

01:03.196 --> 01:05.653
the pool did not contain a dead waiter.

01:05.773 --> 01:07.290
Okay, so...

01:07.410 --> 01:09.094
let's get some unis on the gates,

01:09.214 --> 01:11.180
front, backside, whatever.
Nobody in or out.

01:11.249 --> 01:12.982
And while we wait
for the M.E.,

01:13.051 --> 01:15.885
we'll go talk to the staff,
maybe jog somebody's memory.

01:15.954 --> 01:18.187
- Rim Schott.
- How was that funny?

01:18.256 --> 01:19.956
No, as my gay porn name.

It's not that bad.

02:14.445 --> 02:17.513
No, on the contrary, it's wonderful.

02:17.582 --> 02:18.948
If you enjoy starving to death.

02:19.017 --> 02:20.316
Oh, please, Mother.

02:20.385 --> 02:22.025
The only thing you eat
is cocktail onions.

02:22.053 --> 02:23.653
I simply cannot believe

02:23.721 --> 02:26.322
I let you talk me
into this boondoggle!

02:26.391 --> 02:28.057
Not just me. Lana?

02:28.126 --> 02:29.992
Okay, me too.
A little.

02:30.061 --> 02:31.928
But only because
the CIA blacklisted us.

02:31.996 --> 02:33.529
Plus now with A.J.

02:33.598 --> 02:35.565
I thought it would be safer
than being a spy.

02:35.633 --> 02:37.700
It's safer than being a librarian!

02:37.769 --> 02:40.002
Three months and not a single client.

02:40.071 --> 02:43.072
Oh, for-- Mother, when the word
gets out that Sterling Archer,

02:43.141 --> 02:45.474
the world's greatest
former secret agent,

02:45.543 --> 02:47.977
has his own frickin'
detective agency--

02:48.046 --> 02:51.080
Which technically, you do not.

02:51.149 --> 02:53.616
Because California is assholes.

02:53.685 --> 02:56.052
What have I been saying?
Something about bears.

02:56.120 --> 02:58.754
Because what other explanation
could there possibly be

02:58.823 --> 03:01.991
for California deciding
that a stupid law degree--

03:02.060 --> 03:04.026
And a B.A.
in Criminal Justice.

03:04.095 --> 03:07.396
Shut up. Somehow qualifies
an otherwise total idiot

03:07.465 --> 03:10.533
for a private investigator's
license, but an entire career

03:10.602 --> 03:13.202
as a secret agent does not.
[Cyril] Well, you're lucky they did,

03:13.271 --> 03:15.838
or you, or Ray, or you, Lana,

03:15.907 --> 03:18.580
couldn't work as an
investigator under my license.

03:18.700 --> 03:22.320
And I'm sure that's the last time
we'll hear anything about that. Not.

03:22.440 --> 03:24.028
And you can be sure that the minute...

03:24.148 --> 03:27.016
Wait, the second I qualify
for my P.I. license,

03:27.085 --> 03:29.085
this is the Archer Agency.

03:29.153 --> 03:31.454
Fair enough.
So let's circle back

03:31.522 --> 03:34.757
when you have 2,000 hours
of investigative work

03:34.826 --> 03:37.326
certified by your licensed
employer, who is me.

03:37.395 --> 03:39.662
- Cyril--
- And... go!

03:39.731 --> 03:42.098
[sighs]
2,000 hours?

03:42.166 --> 03:44.333
At this rate--
Mother, we will get clients.

03:44.402 --> 03:46.202
All we need
is one high-profile case.

03:46.270 --> 03:48.270
And some kick-ass advertising.

03:48.339 --> 03:50.006
Give me that.

03:50.074 --> 03:52.475
Pam, if a single one of these
has left this building,

03:52.543 --> 03:54.810
I will personally
sew you into a canvas bag

03:54.879 --> 03:58.114
full of rats and throw
that bag into the river.

03:58.182 --> 04:00.383
I gotta go get my car smogged!

04:00.451 --> 04:02.451
What river?
It's a concrete slab.

04:02.520 --> 04:04.654
The headline there was a bag of rats.

04:04.722 --> 04:07.289
Here's a headline.
"Malory Archer bankrupt.

04:07.358 --> 04:09.191
Feckless Son to Blame."
Look--

04:09.260 --> 04:10.960
And even if we get a case,

04:11.029 --> 04:13.629
what, some cheating husband,
fake whiplash?

04:13.698 --> 04:17.433
The whole thing
is just so...grubby!

04:17.502 --> 04:19.035
Grubby? Grubby?!
[woman] Excuse me.

04:19.103 --> 04:21.637
When we were spies, you murdered
the Prime Minister of Italy.

04:21.706 --> 04:23.339
- Prove it.
- I can't!

04:23.408 --> 04:25.775
- Uh, excuse me?
- Because Krieger chopped him up,

04:25.843 --> 04:27.543
and then we stuffed him in trash cans

04:27.612 --> 04:29.145
all over four different boroughs.

04:29.213 --> 04:31.447
Well, then.
Wait. Four?

04:31.516 --> 04:33.649
I'm not schlepping to Staten Island

04:33.718 --> 04:35.118

Is this the Figgis Agency?

04:41.225 --> 04:42.758
Well, we're not married
to that, but--

04:42.827 --> 04:44.427
Yes, we are.

04:44.495 --> 04:46.362
And yes, it is.

Hello, Cyril Figgis.

[Malory] Blackmail.
I'm afraid so.

05:03.581 --> 05:05.981
You see, my home
was burgled recently,

05:06.050 --> 05:08.884
and in addition to cash
and some jewelry,

05:08.953 --> 05:12.421
they stole a computer disk
with, I suppose

05:12.490 --> 05:16.659
you might call it,
sensitive information?

05:16.728 --> 05:18.294
It's nine o'clock in the morning.

05:18.362 --> 05:19.795
I'm still on Eastern time.

05:19.864 --> 05:21.497
[Lana] Archer.
It's lunchtime there.

05:21.566 --> 05:24.433
Yesterday, a lawyer named
Alan Shapiro contacted me.

05:24.502 --> 05:26.569
He said he was
in possession of the disk

05:26.637 --> 05:28.704
and wished to arrange its return.

05:28.773 --> 05:29.773
For a fee.

05:29.807 --> 05:31.273
And the fee was?

05:31.342 --> 05:33.375
I would think none of your concern.

05:33.444 --> 05:41.050
- But--
- Yeah, Lana.

05:41.119 --> 05:42.752
Oh, Ellis Crane, the movie director.

05:42.820 --> 05:44.520
So do you have any reason to suspect

05:44.589 --> 05:45.654
your ex-husband
is behind this?

05:45.723 --> 05:47.323
I have every reason.

05:47.391 --> 05:49.058
Yeah. Lana.

05:49.127 --> 05:51.260
What?!
But Mr. Shapiro wanted to meet me

05:51.329 --> 05:53.963
at his house, so I assume
the disk is there,

05:54.031 --> 05:55.498
presumably in a safe.

05:55.566 --> 05:58.534
I want you to go there
and recover it.

05:58.603 --> 06:00.236
You mean steal it.
I mean--

06:00.304 --> 06:02.104
Lana, she can't steal
what's already hers.

06:02.173 --> 06:04.006
That's-- Wait,
is it double jeopardy?

06:04.075 --> 06:04.940
[all]
No.

06:05.009 --> 06:06.809
The disk is rightfully mine,

06:06.878 --> 06:09.211
and I will pay more
than fairly for its return.

06:09.280 --> 06:12.047
Well, um, for a case of this nature

06:12.116 --> 06:14.850
our standard rate would be--

06:14.919 --> 06:16.118
Cyril!
What?

06:16.187 --> 06:17.686
Sterling!
For God's sake, man.

06:17.755 --> 06:19.955
Mrs. Deane--
[laughs] Ms.

06:20.024 --> 06:23.759
[scoffing] Ms. Deane isn't
a standard client, Cyril.

06:23.828 --> 06:25.561
She is a film legend.

06:25.630 --> 06:30.166
And as such, she deserves
our legendary service package,

06:30.234 --> 06:33.135
which includes, um--
Get me the disk,

06:33.204 --> 06:36.438
and I will pay your agency $100,000.

06:36.507 --> 06:37.740
[coughing]

06:37.809 --> 06:39.542
Yeah, yeah--
[clears throat]

06:39.610 --> 06:42.444
Yeah, that's our rate for that.

06:42.513 --> 06:44.180
This is Mr. Shapiro's address,

06:44.248 --> 06:46.816
and I want the job done
as soon as possible.

06:46.884 --> 06:48.784
And of course, it goes without saying

06:48.853 --> 06:51.420
that this matter
is strictly confidential.

06:51.489 --> 06:53.923
Apparently not.
And conversely,

06:53.991 --> 06:56.625
anything you think you may
or may not have overheard,

06:56.694 --> 06:59.495
regarding the Italian Prime
Minister's murder and dismemberment--

06:59.564 --> 07:02.131
Alleged murder and dismemberment.

07:02.200 --> 07:04.233
I couldn't care less,
Mr. Archer.

07:04.302 --> 07:06.769
All that matters to me
is that you return the disk.

07:06.838 --> 07:08.637
Now, good day.

07:12.410 --> 07:14.109
[door opening]

07:14.178 --> 07:16.478

07:21.152 --> 07:23.252
Holy shit, $100,000?

07:23.321 --> 07:27.189
I was gonna say $10,000.

07:27.258 --> 07:30.025
[laughing loudly]

07:30.094 --> 07:32.161
Oh, my God!

07:32.230 --> 07:34.930
[sighs] Yeah, what were
you gonna say, smart guy?

07:34.999 --> 07:37.099
[continues laughing]

07:41.839 --> 07:43.105
Nine!

07:44.842 --> 07:47.009
[winding down]

07:52.566 --> 07:54.710
[Archer]
Okay, people, listen up.

07:55.124 --> 07:57.371
This is our first case,
and we're gonna crush it,

07:57.412 --> 07:59.912
so listen up!
These are your assignments.

07:59.981 --> 08:01.781
Pam.
Hey, in case you've forgotten,

08:01.849 --> 08:04.016
the writing is literally on the wall,

08:04.085 --> 08:06.819
and I give the orders around here.

08:06.888 --> 08:09.255
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Please, by all means.

08:09.324 --> 08:11.190
Uh-huh. Um--

08:11.259 --> 08:14.360
Well, our--
Okay.

08:14.429 --> 08:16.996
Archer has your assignments,
so listen up!

08:17.065 --> 08:20.032
Truly inspiring, Cyril.

08:20.101 --> 08:22.501
It's like Patton
and Churchill had a baby.

08:22.570 --> 08:25.104
Oh, and put me down for 15
minutes of investigative work.

08:25.173 --> 08:27.340
That wasn't even 15 seconds!

08:27.408 --> 08:29.875
15 minutes is the smallest
manageable increment.

08:29.944 --> 08:31.744
You dick!
Hey, shut up!

08:31.813 --> 08:35.313
You... also dick!
With just a hint of Oscar Wilde.

08:35.383 --> 08:36.816
Mother, if you're not gonna help,

08:36.884 --> 08:38.751
maybe you'd be more comfortable
in your office.

08:38.820 --> 08:40.620
No, I'm fine here.

08:40.688 --> 08:44.357
I want to see how you're
gonna crack the big case.

08:44.425 --> 08:46.392
Mancy Drew.
[all snickering]

08:46.461 --> 08:48.861
Okay, Pam, this is
our target location.

08:48.930 --> 08:50.563
[all chattering]

08:50.632 --> 08:51.530
That's a nice house.

08:51.599 --> 08:53.899
4220 Arroyo Canyon Road.

08:53.968 --> 08:55.901
Find out everything
you can about this house

08:55.970 --> 08:58.471
from the public records.
Plat map, utilities,

08:58.539 --> 09:00.706
building permits--
Oh, and especially look

09:00.775 --> 09:02.441
for any blueprints.
Oh, man!

09:02.510 --> 09:03.809
Can't Cheryl do that?

09:03.878 --> 09:06.312
I wanted to be the gruff
but lovable driver,

09:06.381 --> 09:08.748
mechanic, and maybe
occasional muscle.

09:08.816 --> 09:10.883
Like a folksy B.A. Baracus.

09:10.952 --> 09:13.052
Fine. Carol,
you're head of research.

09:13.121 --> 09:15.421
I'm on it.

09:15.490 --> 09:18.257
How would one go about being on it?

09:18.326 --> 09:20.059
Try the Internet.

09:20.128 --> 09:21.894
And get everything you can
on the owner,

09:21.963 --> 09:24.380
a lawyer named Alan Shapiro.

09:26.158 --> 09:29.059
I think it's safe to assume
he doesn't eat shellfish.

09:29.179 --> 09:30.618
Hey, not cool!

09:30.738 --> 09:32.538
What?
The fact that he's a Hollywood lawyer

09:32.607 --> 09:34.407
doesn't automatically
make him Jewish.

09:34.475 --> 09:36.242
Eww, he's Jewish?

09:36.311 --> 09:37.922
Probably, but that's not the point.

09:38.042 --> 09:40.242
You can't say shit like that!

09:40.311 --> 09:42.544
Wait a minute.
If you didn't know he was Jewish,

09:42.613 --> 09:44.980
why'd you mention shellfish?
He's allergic!

09:45.049 --> 09:46.548
You buttlicks.

09:46.617 --> 09:47.950
That's why he made that big donation

09:48.018 --> 09:50.686
to the stupid food allergy charity.

09:50.754 --> 09:52.688
Oughta call it the Weak
Bloodlines Foundation.

09:52.756 --> 09:54.790
Lana, you and I will
break into the house,

09:54.858 --> 09:56.892
and since we can
assume there's a safe--

09:56.961 --> 09:58.894
Ray? You care
to join us?

09:58.963 --> 10:02.598
[sighs] I guess, since
we're hourly now.

10:02.666 --> 10:05.734
Okay, you got comms, night vision,

10:05.803 --> 10:07.970
infrared, alarm bypass,

10:08.038 --> 10:09.972
suction cups, this crazy spray,

10:10.040 --> 10:12.480
which shows laser beams, and just
in case there's a guard dog,

10:12.509 --> 10:15.029
you got doggy treats loaded up
with tranquilizers, which I call--

10:15.079 --> 10:16.678
Wait, wait, wait--
I got something for this--

10:16.747 --> 10:19.214
"Hush puppies"
Uh, damn! That's better.

10:19.283 --> 10:22.618
Duh. And since the front of the
house by the road is guarded 24/7,

10:22.686 --> 10:26.488
you're gonna have
to go in from the rear.

10:26.557 --> 10:28.457
No. You all
took it for granted.

10:28.525 --> 10:30.459
But the back hangs off a cliff, like,

10:30.527 --> 10:32.260
a hundred feet above the canyon!

10:32.329 --> 10:35.998
Which is why I invented the
rocket-propelled grappling hook!

10:36.066 --> 10:37.833
You didn't invent that.

10:37.901 --> 10:39.901
Ah, that's what
the patent office said.

10:39.970 --> 10:41.470
And how much is all this costing?

10:41.538 --> 10:42.904
Oh, my God, Cyril.

10:42.973 --> 10:44.539
You have to spend
money to make money.

10:44.608 --> 10:47.409
No! You don't! You just
have to break into a safe!

10:47.478 --> 10:48.810
[roaring whoosh]
[laughing]

10:48.846 --> 10:50.846
[all yelling, screaming]

10:50.931 --> 10:53.515
Shut that damn thing off!
Lame!

10:55.319 --> 10:56.852
Well, what the heck <i>is</i> that thing?

10:56.920 --> 10:58.620
Thermal lance.
For the safe!

10:58.689 --> 11:00.322
Like Jimmy Caan used in <i> Thief.</i>

11:00.391 --> 11:02.391
It'll cut through two feet
of reinforced concrete

11:02.459 --> 11:05.627
like non-reinforced...
butter.

11:05.696 --> 11:08.196
We don't need a thermal lance, ass.

11:08.265 --> 11:10.132
Just a standard
safe-cracking kit.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.734
Well, what's legendary about that?

11:12.803 --> 11:15.337
You know, you guys could help.

11:15.406 --> 11:17.406
Hey, you said you're the muscle.

11:17.474 --> 11:19.207
And what are you doing here?

11:19.276 --> 11:21.576
Pam's my ride home.
[sighs]

11:21.645 --> 11:23.445
I can't even.
And Archer,

11:23.514 --> 11:25.981
do you really need
to do that right now?

11:26.050 --> 11:29.217
Yes, I do. Somebody left
an entire palm print, Lana.

11:29.286 --> 11:32.020
Do you realize what skin oil
can do to the factory finish?

11:32.089 --> 11:34.256
[laughs] You realize how
ridiculous you are,

11:34.324 --> 11:35.557
for buying that automobile?

11:35.626 --> 11:37.659
[scoffs]
What? Shut up, it's amazing!

11:37.728 --> 11:39.946
Okay. So we'll just
follow you in the van,

11:40.066 --> 11:41.956
and watch in amazement.
Haha!

11:42.076 --> 11:43.441
Try to keep up!

11:45.378 --> 11:47.213
So, my guess would be the fuel pump?

11:47.504 --> 11:51.106
Great. Shut your guess-hole.
Oh, come on!

11:51.175 --> 11:52.949
It's gotta be under warranty.

11:53.069 --> 11:56.712
Right?
[sighs] I don't know.

11:56.780 --> 11:59.815
Warranty's in Italian.

11:59.883 --> 12:01.016
[all laughing]

12:08.094 --> 12:09.255
[grappling hook whooshes]

12:11.059 --> 12:13.159
[Archer]
Okay. Make sure they're secure.

12:13.228 --> 12:15.194
'Cause they're
our only way out of here.

12:15.263 --> 12:18.024
[sighs] Oh, I was hopin' T.C. was
gonna come pick us up in the chopper.

12:18.066 --> 12:19.120
Ha!

12:19.307 --> 12:21.440
Well, but he's gonna
be busy flying around,

12:21.509 --> 12:23.242
searching for your battered corpses,

12:23.311 --> 12:25.878
only to find out later
that all the coyotes left

12:25.947 --> 12:28.948
was a pile of titanium gears
and a shitty weave.

12:29.017 --> 12:30.549
[gasps]
First of all--

12:32.020 --> 12:34.587
This is not a weave!
[giggling] Okay!

12:36.824 --> 12:38.679
Well, it ain't a shitty one.

12:40.223 --> 12:42.306
You should do the camera first.

12:42.426 --> 12:43.978
I said do the cameras first!

12:44.098 --> 12:46.065
[muttering]

12:46.134 --> 12:48.067
I know, right?
How awesome is it to be back,

12:48.136 --> 12:49.435
doing what we're best at?

12:49.504 --> 12:51.904
What? Robbery?
It's not robbery, Lana.

12:51.973 --> 12:53.939
It's burglary.
Or maybe home invasion,

12:54.008 --> 12:56.642
if we run into anybody, which
hopefully we won't, but...

12:56.711 --> 13:00.012
I'm talking fieldcraft!
Stealth! Teamwork!

13:00.081 --> 13:02.451
Night vision,
grappling hooks--

13:02.549 --> 13:04.616
Whatever the hell Ray's doing.

13:04.684 --> 13:07.164
Well, it better be the cameras.
Ray, are you doing the cameras?

13:13.199 --> 13:15.399
[softly] Yes, Lana, I
was doing the cameras.

13:15.468 --> 13:17.968
Okay, so cut the alarm
and jam the cell phone signal.

13:18.037 --> 13:20.337
And Lana? The locks aren't
gonna pick themselves.

13:20.406 --> 13:21.772
And meanwhile, you were doing...

13:21.841 --> 13:24.208
I'm goin' infrared, Lana.

13:24.260 --> 13:27.594
[gasps, laughs]
Holy shit!

13:27.680 --> 13:29.880
It's just like <i> Predator!</i>

13:29.932 --> 13:31.815
In 3-D!
Ow!

13:31.884 --> 13:33.684
[sighs] Give me 90
seconds on the lock.

13:33.753 --> 13:35.285
Sixty seconds on alarm and phone.

13:35.354 --> 13:36.587
[Lana]
Not a competition.

13:36.655 --> 13:38.555
Seriously, we were made for this!

13:38.624 --> 13:40.157
We'll be out of here in no time.

13:40.226 --> 13:42.326
Don't count your chickens
before they're hatched!

13:42.395 --> 13:45.229
Okay, A, I'm pretty sure chickens
give live birth, like sharks.

13:45.297 --> 13:47.931
What the--
And B, compared to espionage,

13:48.000 --> 13:51.268
P.I. work is gonna be
a total cakewalk!

13:51.337 --> 13:53.537
But... I doubt they've
gotten the disk yet.

13:53.606 --> 13:55.706
Don't you think it's a little
premature to be celebrating?

13:55.775 --> 13:57.875
Who's celebrating?
We're out of liquor!

13:57.943 --> 14:00.844
But I admit, I'm
cautiously optimistic.

14:00.913 --> 14:02.846
Because out here, you can buy
liquor at the grocery store?

14:02.915 --> 14:05.082
Literally, the only thing
about Los Angeles

14:05.151 --> 14:06.850
that doesn't make me want to vomit.

14:06.919 --> 14:10.120
But I'm talking about
this new line of work.

14:10.189 --> 14:13.457
A good detective and a good
spy share a lot of skills,

14:13.526 --> 14:15.392
and I'll deny I ever said this,

14:15.461 --> 14:17.694
but Sterling was an excellent spy.

14:17.763 --> 14:21.465
So... maybe we can actually
make a go of this!

14:21.534 --> 14:24.802
I mean, even Pam and Carol are
showing some talent for it.

14:24.870 --> 14:27.438
[Carol gasps] Oh, my God, Pam!
I forgot to give

14:27.506 --> 14:30.941
Mr. Archer one of the public records
that came back on that guy's address!

14:31.010 --> 14:32.709
What? His license?

14:32.778 --> 14:35.212
Well, I mean, it was
kind of a license.

14:35.281 --> 14:37.247
[ferocious growling]

14:37.316 --> 14:40.084
Oh! Mother of--

14:40.152 --> 14:41.819
[laughing] Sweet Jesus!
What?

14:41.887 --> 14:44.321
[screams]
Run!

14:44.390 --> 14:48.058
No, no, no, don't run!
I got them... treats.

14:48.127 --> 14:50.127
[screaming]
Owww!

14:50.196 --> 14:52.796
Bad dog!

14:52.865 --> 14:54.467
Oww!
Archer, lower your voice!

14:56.389 --> 14:58.472
Why don't you make it quiet,
shoot up!

14:58.592 --> 15:00.321
With what? We didn't bring guns.
What?

15:00.573 --> 15:03.006
Plus, awww.
Oh, the treats. Give 'em the treats.

15:03.075 --> 15:04.908
Wait, no, hang on.
[kissing noises]

15:04.977 --> 15:07.244
Treats!
No, no, no, no, wait!

15:07.313 --> 15:08.412
[screams]

15:08.481 --> 15:09.513
[both gasping]

15:11.383 --> 15:12.850
[Archer]
Ugh! Ooh!

15:12.918 --> 15:13.817
[together]
Ooh.

15:13.886 --> 15:16.854
[grunting, groaning]

15:32.905 --> 15:35.105
[Lana] Well...
[dog groaning]

15:35.174 --> 15:37.241
Aww, sleepy, babies.

15:37.309 --> 15:39.076
Guess we oughta...
get crackin'.

15:39.145 --> 15:41.812
Rim shot!
That'd be a good porn name.

15:41.881 --> 15:44.360
Mine would be
"Lance Biggerstaff."

15:44.480 --> 15:45.904
I'm picturing a gay wizard.

15:46.024 --> 15:48.268
I always am.

15:48.354 --> 15:51.522
[coughs, moans]

15:51.590 --> 15:55.125
Eat a dick, gravity.
Aww.

15:55.194 --> 15:57.861
No, I don't get this at all.

15:57.930 --> 15:59.442
Maybe 'cause it's upside down.

15:59.562 --> 16:02.633
Wait. Really?
Yeah, you're just kind of a hick.

16:02.701 --> 16:05.502
Said the man with a relative
called, "Uncle Paw-Paw."

16:05.571 --> 16:08.205
[scoffs] That's 'cause
he's my mother's...

16:08.274 --> 16:09.706
Yeah, no.
Never mind.

16:09.775 --> 16:11.141
So what's the deal?
How's that going?

16:11.210 --> 16:13.143
[whispers]
It's goin' great!

16:13.212 --> 16:15.812
And you talking is helping!
So, what do you think is on that disk?

16:15.881 --> 16:17.781
Uh, duh, sex tape!

16:17.850 --> 16:20.417
Please. She's like 100.
She's like 50.

16:20.486 --> 16:23.287
And she's also Veronica Deane,
you big jealous bitch!

16:23.355 --> 16:25.355
[muffled]
Archer?

16:25.424 --> 16:29.126
Don't scream. Because you have
no reason to feel threatened

16:29.195 --> 16:30.727
by Veronica Deane.
[annoyed grunt]

16:30.796 --> 16:33.163
Am I attracted to her?
Obviously. I mean, come on.

16:33.232 --> 16:34.232
You saw <i> Shanghai Moon.</i>

16:34.266 --> 16:35.699
Oh, my God. That dress?

16:35.768 --> 16:37.501
[chuckles]
Right. I mean, yeah.

16:37.570 --> 16:39.570
Maybe it was 20 years ago,
but if anything,

16:39.638 --> 16:41.038
she's hotter now--
Oww!

16:41.106 --> 16:43.073
Shh!
Ow! Ow...

16:43.142 --> 16:45.142
How could you even tell
if she was still hot?

16:45.211 --> 16:47.077
She was basically just gigantic
sunglasses and a big hat!

16:47.146 --> 16:49.446
Trust me, Lana, she's still hot.

16:49.515 --> 16:52.683
Oh, and the joke's on you, because
if I have rabies, now you've got it!

16:52.751 --> 16:54.631
Uh, I don't think you want
to get bitchy with me

16:54.687 --> 16:55.986
about communicable diseases.

16:56.055 --> 16:57.554
[scoffs]
Crabs aren't a disease!

16:57.623 --> 16:59.990
Oh, my God. First of all...
[clattering]

17:00.059 --> 17:03.327
So, if y'all are done having your
little post-fight-makeup-sex-fight--

17:03.395 --> 17:05.155
That's not what we do!
[whispers] Oh, my God.

17:05.262 --> 17:08.732
That is <i> all</i> you do! Now can we go,
before Shapiro knows we're here?

17:08.800 --> 17:11.588
How would he?
Except for two sleepy grizzly bears,

17:11.708 --> 17:13.365
we didn't leave...
[Man screaming]

17:13.627 --> 17:15.564
Intruder!

17:15.684 --> 17:17.790
Intruder!

17:17.910 --> 17:19.343
That's bullshit.
How did he know?

17:20.846 --> 17:23.814
Guards!
Yeah, but besides that?

17:23.882 --> 17:26.583
Why didn't you tell us you were
bleeding like a Russian princess?

17:26.652 --> 17:29.219
Because I honestly didn't know!
How could you not?

17:29.288 --> 17:31.788
Because I took a bunch
of painkillers at the office!

17:31.857 --> 17:33.357
Why?
[growls]

17:33.425 --> 17:35.392
Because somebody left them out, Lana.

17:35.461 --> 17:38.295
Move, you idiots.
They got the disk!

17:38.364 --> 17:40.330
I am so angry at you right now!

17:40.399 --> 17:42.299
Well, you shouldn't
give me that power--

17:42.368 --> 17:43.867
[screams]
Jump!

17:43.936 --> 17:46.737
Whoo-hoo!
Painkillers!

17:46.805 --> 17:51.208
There! Agh! Agh!
Agh! Agh! Agh! Agh!

17:51.277 --> 17:55.245
Well, I hope you brought enough
painkillers to share with the class!

17:55.314 --> 17:57.547
No. I ate 'em all.
Because we're all gonna get shot.

17:57.616 --> 18:00.684
Relax. They're not gonna hit
us with those suppressors on,

18:00.753 --> 18:03.287
they'd need a--
Grenade!!

18:03.355 --> 18:06.239
And with that
having been said--

18:06.325 --> 18:07.624
Son of a bitch!

18:07.693 --> 18:09.926
Why does a divorce lawyer
have grenades?!

18:09.995 --> 18:11.928
Ray, they're terrible people!

18:11.997 --> 18:14.498
You assholes!
If they live, you die.

18:14.566 --> 18:16.166
Archer, what are you doing?

18:16.235 --> 18:18.168
Getting you out of here.

18:18.237 --> 18:20.504
Ray, get her to the van.

18:20.572 --> 18:22.306
What about you?
I'll be fine.

18:22.374 --> 18:25.108
I lied, I got like,
20 more. Go!

18:25.177 --> 18:26.877
Hang on, honey.

18:26.945 --> 18:29.479
[Lana shouting]
Archer!

18:29.548 --> 18:32.215
Wow, say what you will about cyborgs.

18:32.284 --> 18:34.785
Sure can run good.

18:34.853 --> 18:36.720
And I should take
the fast way down too, so--

18:36.789 --> 18:39.723
[exhaling rapidly]

18:39.792 --> 18:42.242
[screaming]

18:42.328 --> 18:43.193
[Archer]
Ow!

18:43.245 --> 18:48.365
[grunting]

18:48.417 --> 18:49.417
[shouting]

18:55.547 --> 18:57.278
[Cyril]
And now, Ms. Deane--

18:57.378 --> 18:59.678
As promised, your computer disk.

18:59.747 --> 19:03.415
And your cashier's check
for $100,000.

19:03.484 --> 19:05.918
And while I appreciate
your firm's hard work,

19:05.986 --> 19:07.619
I'm sure you'll understand when I say

19:07.688 --> 19:09.321
I hope we never meet again.

19:09.390 --> 19:11.924
A feeling that
I assure you is mutual.

19:11.992 --> 19:14.526
Then I bid you good day and goodbye.

19:16.363 --> 19:18.630
Yay!
[grunts]

19:18.699 --> 19:20.966
Lower your voice.
[whispers] Ow.

19:21.035 --> 19:23.201
Oh, let her enjoy it, Sterling.

19:23.270 --> 19:27.573
We just made $100,000!
Well, minus expenses, which--

19:27.641 --> 19:31.577
Which reminds me we need to
add an extra $1,200 to that.

19:31.645 --> 19:34.947
For what?
Something called a <i> pompa di benzina?</i>

19:35.015 --> 19:36.415
Called it.
No, you didn't!

19:36.483 --> 19:38.917
And while you're at it,
add a case of champagne.

19:38.986 --> 19:40.719
We deserve to celebrate.
[all gasping]

19:40.788 --> 19:42.087
Ooh!
Bubbly!

19:42.156 --> 19:44.289
Damn it, Veronica Deane already left?

19:44.358 --> 19:46.191
I wanted her to sign this head shot.

19:46.260 --> 19:49.328
Ooh, Joan Crawford's
gonna be so jealous.

19:49.396 --> 19:51.363
You know what--
[woman] Excuse me.

19:51.432 --> 19:53.765
[all groaning]

19:53.834 --> 19:55.534
[Ray]
Oh, my God.

19:55.569 --> 19:57.302
Is this the Figgis Agency?

19:57.371 --> 20:00.038
Again, not married to that.
Yes, we are!

20:00.107 --> 20:02.240
[chuckles]
And yes, it is.

20:02.309 --> 20:04.409
I'm Cyril Figgis, owner, CEO,

20:04.478 --> 20:07.279
fully licensed investigator.
And you are?

20:07.348 --> 20:09.181
She's...

20:11.051 --> 20:14.152
She's...
My name is Veronica Deane.

20:14.221 --> 20:15.754
[all gasping]
Oh, goddamn it.

20:15.823 --> 20:18.390
May we talk somewhere privately?

20:18.459 --> 20:21.026
Wait a minute.
If you're Veronica Deane,

20:21.095 --> 20:22.494
then who the hell was--
[gasps]

20:22.563 --> 20:23.996
[whispering]
Ow.

20:24.064 --> 20:27.299
I, um-- Uh, that is
to say, uh, it's uh--

20:27.368 --> 20:29.368
Such a pleasure to meet you.

20:29.436 --> 20:31.703
May I ask how you
heard of our agency?

20:31.772 --> 20:36.008
My housekeeper found this under her
windshield wiper at the supermarket.

20:36.076 --> 20:38.276
[snickering]

20:38.345 --> 20:40.579
His name's Furlock Bones.
