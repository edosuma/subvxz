If this is a sales call
on a Sunday morning...

01:41.409 --> 01:44.345
Settle. It's me, JJ.

01:44.413 --> 01:46.915
I tried your cell.
Listen, something's come up.

01:46.982 --> 01:49.184
You need to get down
to the office pronto.

01:49.252 --> 01:51.353
Oh. You are kidding.

01:51.421 --> 01:53.355
I know. I wish
psychopathic killers

01:53.422 --> 01:55.525
would be a little more
respectful of our weekends, too,

01:55.592 --> 01:57.660
but what are you gonna do?

01:57.728 --> 01:59.362
Is everything ok?

01:59.430 --> 02:01.030
Um, no.

02:01.098 --> 02:03.099
Kevin and I got in
a fight last night,

02:03.167 --> 02:06.635
and to self soothe,
I drank a lot of wine.

02:06.703 --> 02:09.304
And, JJ, you know
I can't drink wine.

02:09.372 --> 02:10.839
Why did I drink
so much wine?

02:10.907 --> 02:12.140
You'll be fine.

02:12.208 --> 02:13.642
No, I don't know.

02:13.710 --> 02:16.144
'Cause right now everything is blurring.
Oh, my God.

02:16.212 --> 02:18.413
My hair hurts.
How is that possible?

02:18.481 --> 02:20.415
He's coming out of the shower.

02:20.483 --> 02:23.319
I hate confrontation. It was
such a fight. I hate confrontation.

02:23.386 --> 02:24.620
Then don't confront.

02:24.688 --> 02:26.622
Just kiss, make up,

02:26.690 --> 02:29.159
and get your butt
over here.

02:31.896 --> 02:35.265
What is this,
Grand Central Station?

02:37.368 --> 02:38.301
Oh, God.

02:42.707 --> 02:43.674
Kevin.

02:43.741 --> 02:45.643
I am so sorry
about last night.

02:45.710 --> 02:48.012
I should not have
stormed out like that.

02:48.079 --> 02:49.346
You stormed out?

02:49.414 --> 02:51.348
Yeah.

02:51.416 --> 02:53.684
You stormed out
all last night?

02:53.752 --> 02:56.019
Yeah.

02:56.087 --> 02:58.088
What's, uh--

03:02.894 --> 03:05.897
Hey. You see we gotta
go in, right?

03:05.965 --> 03:08.700
Yes. Y-yes.

03:08.768 --> 03:10.936
Uh, JJ just called me, too.

03:11.004 --> 03:11.971
Let's go.

03:12.038 --> 03:13.039
My things.

03:13.106 --> 03:17.310
Mine and mine and--

03:17.378 --> 03:18.611
this is yours.

03:18.679 --> 03:19.846
This is mine.

03:21.616 --> 03:24.252
See you there.

03:24.319 --> 03:25.753
Hey, let's go.

03:31.227 --> 03:33.796
Danny Savino, the floor manager
at the Sapphire Lady casino

03:33.864 --> 03:36.565
in Atlantic City was found dead
in his office this morning.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.534
Blunt force trauma
to the head.

03:38.601 --> 03:40.102
An empty wallet

03:40.170 --> 03:42.038
and money clip left
next to the body.

03:42.106 --> 03:44.341
Mug shot. This guy's
got a record.

03:44.408 --> 03:46.910
Savino was a member
of the Agnoli crime family.

03:46.978 --> 03:48.578
Sorry. Sorry.

03:48.646 --> 03:50.681
They're active
in the Atlantic City area.

03:50.749 --> 03:51.849
How's the head?

03:51.916 --> 03:53.984
Not all the aspirins
in all the pharmacies...

03:54.052 --> 03:56.120
It looks like
a robbery gone bad.

03:56.188 --> 03:57.922
Why was the BAU called in?

03:57.990 --> 04:00.459
8 one-dollar bills
surrounding an 8 card.

04:00.526 --> 04:01.994
That's highly ritualistic.

04:02.061 --> 04:03.729
And because Savino has
ties to organized crime,

04:03.797 --> 04:06.432
agents in New Jersey
are worried about things escalating.

04:06.500 --> 04:08.801
Well, it doesn't take much
to ignite a mob war.

04:08.869 --> 04:10.870
And collateral damage
means nothing to these guys.

04:10.938 --> 04:12.474
If we don't get a handle
on this soon, innocent

04:12.499 --> 04:13.699
people are gonna die.

04:21.684 --> 04:24.286
Hey, honey, it's me.

04:24.353 --> 04:27.789
Listen, the most amazing
thing is happening.

04:27.857 --> 04:30.125
I'm at the Sapphire Lady
right now,

04:30.193 --> 04:32.862
and I am on a run
you would not believe.

04:32.930 --> 04:35.164
Everything we ever talked about,

04:35.232 --> 04:36.999
it's gonna happen.

04:37.067 --> 04:39.769
I'll try you again later,
ok, Honey?

04:39.837 --> 04:41.070
Bye.

A Chinese proverb says,

05:44.347 --> 05:48.417
"at the gambling table,
there are no fathers and sons."

05:49.133 --> 05:51.401
No question. "Godfather II,"
hands down.

05:51.469 --> 05:53.670
No, no, gotta be "Scarface."

05:53.738 --> 05:56.306
For me, "The Untouchables."
Spence?

05:56.373 --> 05:58.941
Mm, probably "Le Cercle Rouge,"
the 1970s French classic.

05:59.009 --> 06:01.510
But "Den Tredje Vaagan"
is definitely a close second.

06:01.578 --> 06:03.512
Yeah, that was
my runner-up, too.

06:03.580 --> 06:05.080
What about you, Rossi?

06:05.148 --> 06:06.714
Best ever
gangster flick.

06:06.782 --> 06:08.282
I've had too much
of the real thing

06:08.350 --> 06:09.684
to be a fan
of mob movies.

06:09.751 --> 06:11.886
Garcia, did we get the crime
scene surveillance video yet?

06:11.953 --> 06:13.287
No, sir, because
there wasn't any.

06:13.354 --> 06:14.622
That's not possible.

06:14.689 --> 06:16.090
Every inch of the casino
is surveilled

06:16.158 --> 06:17.358
every minute of every day.

06:17.426 --> 06:19.527
Yeah. Apparently the footage was
tampered with, so...

06:19.595 --> 06:21.395
All right. Reid and Prentiss,
go to the crime scene.

06:21.463 --> 06:23.130
Dave, you and JJ find out
if Savino was involved

06:23.198 --> 06:24.965
in anything the local
authorities don't know about.

06:25.033 --> 06:27.134
Morgan and I will contact
the local FBI office

06:27.202 --> 06:28.836
and arrange a ceasefire
with the families.

06:38.646 --> 06:40.814
Yes, sir,
you're on the line.

06:43.451 --> 06:45.785
There you go.

06:49.856 --> 06:51.524
That's very good.

06:51.591 --> 06:53.058
Whoo!

06:55.696 --> 06:58.431
Yes! Yes! Yes!

06:58.498 --> 07:01.200
Oh ho ho ho!

07:04.671 --> 07:06.606
It looks like
the party's over here.

07:06.674 --> 07:07.641
Mind if I join?

07:07.708 --> 07:09.543
Hey. There you are.

07:09.610 --> 07:12.413
Eddie! That's my man.
There you are.

07:12.480 --> 07:14.081
Gee, Curtis.
Those all yours?

07:14.149 --> 07:16.451
Oh, yes.

07:16.518 --> 07:18.386
Stay right here.

07:18.454 --> 07:21.289
I've got plans with you.

07:22.358 --> 07:24.459
Oh, you are on
a hot streak.

07:25.694 --> 07:27.495
Too bad your old man
couldn't see this, huh?

07:27.563 --> 07:30.131
Hey, did you hear what
happened last night?

07:30.198 --> 07:33.034
Danny Savino got his head
bashed in. He's dead.

07:33.101 --> 07:35.302
Didn't you two--you two did
some business together, right?

07:35.370 --> 07:38.105
You good to go?
Not anymore. Yes, here we go.

07:39.208 --> 07:40.942
Winner--8 the hard way!

07:42.211 --> 07:43.312
Oh, yes!

07:43.379 --> 07:44.513
Thank you.

07:44.581 --> 07:45.648
You look a little
strung out, man.

07:45.716 --> 07:47.283
When's the last time
you got some sleep?

07:47.351 --> 07:48.885
Oh, I don't know, man.
A couple of days.

07:48.953 --> 07:49.986
Yeah?

07:50.054 --> 07:51.255
You would not believe

07:51.322 --> 07:53.657
what's been going on
with me, man. It's crazy.

07:53.725 --> 07:55.159
So I was headed up north
for a job interview.

07:55.226 --> 07:57.327
A job interview? What about
the job you already got?

07:57.395 --> 07:59.162
Yeah. I got fired.

07:59.230 --> 08:00.163
How come?

08:00.231 --> 08:02.933
I punched out my boss.
All right?

08:03.000 --> 08:05.335
But look, look, look. I stopped
on the turnpike, I buy a scratcher.

08:05.403 --> 08:07.838
Bam! $250 instant winner.

08:07.905 --> 08:09.539
So I jump in the car,
I pop a u-turn,

08:09.607 --> 08:11.441
I come right back here.

08:11.509 --> 08:13.610
Come on.

08:13.678 --> 08:15.779
Ohh!

08:15.847 --> 08:18.616
So I walk in the casino,
it happens again.

08:18.683 --> 08:20.618
I put a dollar
in the slot machine,

08:20.686 --> 08:22.354
$500 payout.

08:22.422 --> 08:23.889
And now this.

08:23.957 --> 08:26.024
I am on the craziest roll.
I'm telling you.

08:26.092 --> 08:28.327
If I get the buy-in for that
million-dollar poker tournament

08:28.394 --> 08:30.462
the day after tomorrow,
I'm telling you, I could win that.

08:30.530 --> 08:32.063
Listen, I could win that.

08:32.131 --> 08:34.700
What have you been smoking?
That's a 50-grand buy-in.

08:34.767 --> 08:35.934
I hope you don't mind.

08:35.960 --> 08:37.597
I thought a little
celebration was in order.

08:37.804 --> 08:39.572
No, don't mind at all.

08:39.639 --> 08:40.972
Money well spent.

08:41.041 --> 08:43.342
- Are we good to go?
- Everyone ready?

08:43.409 --> 08:46.045
Trust me.

08:46.113 --> 08:47.313
Mmm.

08:47.381 --> 08:49.148
All right, let's go 500.
All right, shooter.

08:49.216 --> 08:50.850
8 the hard way again.

08:50.917 --> 08:53.386
You want me
to blow on them?

08:53.453 --> 08:55.655
Pile on, everybody.

08:55.723 --> 08:56.923
Please.

08:58.593 --> 09:00.260
Ooh. Ooh.

09:00.328 --> 09:01.362
Ooh. Ooh.

09:01.430 --> 09:03.264
Come on, be good to me.

09:03.332 --> 09:05.934
Aah!

09:09.639 --> 09:12.841
Electric strike lock.
Impressive.

09:12.909 --> 09:15.077
And hard to bypass.
If this was a robbery,

09:15.145 --> 09:16.912
the unsub must have slipped in
right behind him.

09:16.980 --> 09:18.713
But Savino could have
known the killer.

09:18.781 --> 09:19.948
He could have let him in
himself.

09:20.015 --> 09:21.949
He wasn't expecting this
to turn into a brawl.

09:22.017 --> 09:23.951
You know, maybe the unsub
wasn't either.

09:24.019 --> 09:25.453
If this was premeditated,

09:25.521 --> 09:27.588
you'd think he would have
brought a knife or a gun with him.

09:27.656 --> 09:30.158
The bowling trophy's more
a weapon of opportunity.

09:30.225 --> 09:31.626
Is this
the only camera?

09:31.694 --> 09:33.127
Yes, ma'am, but the disk
was removed.

09:33.195 --> 09:35.463
The casinos have a central terminal
that backs up and stores

09:35.530 --> 09:36.964
all surveillance
footage, right?

09:37.032 --> 09:38.933
Mr. Savino didn't
want that in his office.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.667
He put in
a personal camera.

09:40.735 --> 09:43.303
So the victim bypassed
a security system

09:43.371 --> 09:45.339
that would have revealed
his own killer.

09:45.406 --> 09:48.008
What didn't he want
anyone to see?

09:52.179 --> 09:55.816
Put your hands together
for Ginger...

09:57.218 --> 09:58.953
Vince Repeti?

10:00.555 --> 10:02.189
Who's asking?

10:02.257 --> 10:04.191
Agent Jareau.
This is Agent Rossi.

10:04.259 --> 10:05.660
We're with the FBI.

10:05.727 --> 10:07.161
We understand
you've cooperated

10:07.229 --> 10:10.031
with the Bureau before
when we've needed information.

10:10.098 --> 10:12.166
"Before" being
the operative word.

10:12.234 --> 10:13.535
I'm retired.

10:13.603 --> 10:15.770
This is how you plan
on spending your golden years?

10:15.838 --> 10:17.038
What can I say?

10:17.106 --> 10:20.374
Some guys like to futz around
with little golf carts,

10:20.441 --> 10:21.842
me, I love the ladies.

10:21.910 --> 10:22.976
I hear ya.

10:23.044 --> 10:24.611
Me, I like to spend my time

10:24.679 --> 10:26.346
chatting with my old friends

10:26.413 --> 10:28.714
down at the New Jersey
parole board.

10:28.782 --> 10:31.851
Listen, we just need you
to come out of retirement

10:31.918 --> 10:35.588
long enough to tell us
a little about Danny Savino.

10:37.858 --> 10:40.260
He's dead now,
so what the hell.

10:41.262 --> 10:44.365
For 8 days and 7 nights
of sheer heaven,

10:44.432 --> 10:48.036
afternoon massages
on white sandy beaches,

10:48.103 --> 10:50.386
yes, you can win
an all-expenses-paid trip

10:50.411 --> 10:51.648
to paradise.

10:52.274 --> 10:55.043
But you can't win
if you don't play.

10:55.110 --> 10:57.311
But you already know that,
don't you, Curtis?

10:57.379 --> 11:00.347
You've dreamed of this
your whole life.

11:00.415 --> 11:03.917
Most people don't understand,
but you're not like most people,

11:03.985 --> 11:05.719
are you, Curtis?

11:05.787 --> 11:08.088
You don't think small.

11:08.155 --> 11:10.890
You are not content
with a small life.

11:10.958 --> 11:13.426
All this is going
to be yours, Curtis,

11:13.493 --> 11:15.528
for you and your wife.

11:15.595 --> 11:18.164
You just need to maintain
your focus.

11:18.231 --> 11:20.033
Don't waver.

11:20.100 --> 11:23.403
It's right there,
if you can just win.

11:23.471 --> 11:25.772
Curtis? Curtis!

11:25.840 --> 11:26.873
What are you doing?

11:26.941 --> 11:28.842
Sorry, sweetheart,

11:28.910 --> 11:30.010
he's taken.

11:30.078 --> 11:31.145
Really?

11:31.246 --> 11:32.747
I'm his wife.

11:35.084 --> 11:37.219
All right, let's go.
Come here. Come here.

11:37.286 --> 11:38.687
I'm winning, Teri.

11:38.754 --> 11:40.355
I'm winning big.

11:40.422 --> 11:42.757
You told me
you were going to Philly.

11:42.825 --> 11:45.759
I was. But I stumbled
onto this system.

11:45.827 --> 11:47.194
I don't really
understand it myself yet--

11:47.262 --> 11:50.063
every week
you got a new system.

11:50.130 --> 11:52.799
We can't pay the mortgage.
The bank is foreclosing on us.

11:52.866 --> 11:55.702
But this--
this system works.

11:55.769 --> 11:58.571
There's a big poker
tournament

11:58.639 --> 12:00.773
day after tomorrow.

12:00.841 --> 12:03.410
Million-dollar winner
take all.

12:03.478 --> 12:06.814
The streak I'm on right now,
I could win that thing.

12:06.881 --> 12:08.482
We'd be rich.

12:08.550 --> 12:10.385
And then I'm done.

12:10.452 --> 12:12.820
I swear.

12:17.293 --> 12:19.193
I want a divorce.

12:20.562 --> 12:22.596
What?

12:22.663 --> 12:24.932
I'm sorry.

12:26.234 --> 12:27.802
I'm going to my sister's.

12:30.406 --> 12:33.074
You--you show up here
and you announce that?

12:33.142 --> 12:34.809
You're hurting me, Curtis.

12:34.877 --> 12:38.345
This is our dream.
Yours and mine together.

12:38.413 --> 12:40.381
You're hurting me.

12:46.922 --> 12:48.356
Stay away.

12:48.423 --> 12:50.191
I mean it.

12:55.431 --> 12:57.865
We appreciate
your cooperation.

13:01.703 --> 13:03.638
Agent Goslin.

13:03.705 --> 13:05.540
Any luck
with our mob bosses?

13:05.607 --> 13:07.341
Well, I think
we bought some time.

13:07.409 --> 13:08.943
What about the crime scene?

13:09.011 --> 13:12.614
Savino purposely bypassed
the standard casino security.

13:12.682 --> 13:13.982
And I think we know why.

13:14.050 --> 13:15.484
Danny Savino
supplemented his income

13:15.552 --> 13:17.319
by loaning money
to casino patrons.

13:17.387 --> 13:18.887
It explains why he changed
the camera in his office.

13:18.955 --> 13:21.156
He didn't want his bosses
to know he was freelancing.

13:21.224 --> 13:22.692
So we're looking
for a gambler.

13:22.759 --> 13:24.861
A gambler in Atlantic City.

13:24.928 --> 13:26.630
That narrows the field.

13:35.173 --> 13:37.274
7 out.

14:43.577 --> 14:44.844
You scared me.

14:44.912 --> 14:46.679
Sorry.

14:46.747 --> 14:49.115
Uh, we never got to finish
that champagne.

14:49.182 --> 14:51.450
Pass.

14:51.518 --> 14:53.652
I--I don't know what happened,

14:53.720 --> 14:55.388
but my luck
is gonna turn around.

14:55.456 --> 14:58.658
Yeah, well,
when it does, give me a call.

15:00.528 --> 15:03.463
Maybe--maybe we could
go somewhere and--

15:03.531 --> 15:05.132
I said no, ok?

15:05.200 --> 15:07.268
We came up empty
tonight, both of us.

15:07.336 --> 15:08.803
It happens.

15:10.372 --> 15:13.475
I meant what I said
about my luck turning around.

15:13.542 --> 15:15.477
It's going to. I can sense it.

15:15.545 --> 15:18.980
Right. With that
gambler's esp of yours.

15:19.048 --> 15:21.716
You and all the other
losers in this town.

16:00.764 --> 16:03.933
Hey, what are you
looking for?

16:04.001 --> 16:05.602
Discarded matches.

16:05.670 --> 16:07.679
The victim had
a freshly-lit cigarette.

16:07.680 --> 16:10.215
But there was no lighter or
matches in her purse or the car.

16:10.283 --> 16:11.750
Our unsub lit it for her.

16:11.818 --> 16:13.218
It means she wasn't
afraid of him.

16:14.387 --> 16:15.721
Hey, Garcia,
you're on speaker.

16:15.789 --> 16:19.458
Patti Riolo,
aka Francesca.

16:19.525 --> 16:21.159
Hometown,
Rice Lake, Wisconsin.

16:21.227 --> 16:22.828
Up until 3 years ago,

16:22.895 --> 16:25.097
she worked with a high-end
escort service in Manhattan.

16:25.164 --> 16:26.898
How high, you ask?
I will tell you.

16:26.966 --> 16:28.166
Nosebleed high.

16:28.234 --> 16:31.069
$5,000 a night and up.

16:31.137 --> 16:33.605
Now she's trolling
gaming tables in Atlantic City.

16:33.672 --> 16:36.180
I imagine that 5 grand
a night window was very short

16:36.205 --> 16:37.405
in her profession.

16:37.810 --> 16:40.344
Well, this is gonna turn
into a circus real fast.

16:40.412 --> 16:42.680
Both residents
and visitors to Atlantic City

16:42.748 --> 16:45.317
are on edge tonight
as the Circle of 8 killer

16:45.384 --> 16:46.918
has apparently struck again.

16:46.986 --> 16:50.756
No way. That's the hooker
who was all over you last night.

16:50.823 --> 16:53.025
They're saying the same guy
killed Danny Savino.

16:53.093 --> 16:54.594
You knew both victims.

16:54.661 --> 16:55.995
That's weird.

16:56.063 --> 16:58.465
My bad luck must have
rubbed off on them.

16:58.532 --> 17:01.335
Listen, you gotta forget
about Teri.

17:01.403 --> 17:03.003
She was holding you back.

17:03.071 --> 17:05.006
Every time she stuck
her nose in things,

17:05.073 --> 17:06.540
your luck went cold.

17:06.608 --> 17:08.877
Hey, you could win that
million-dollar tournament

17:08.944 --> 17:12.214
and then go to Tahiti
on your own, huh? Yeah!

17:12.281 --> 17:14.348
Live your dreams, man.

17:14.416 --> 17:16.385
You know where we spent
our honeymoon?

17:16.453 --> 17:17.719
Where?

17:17.787 --> 17:20.256
Some half-assed motel
in Florida.

17:20.323 --> 17:23.626
Went to a theme park.

17:23.693 --> 17:25.227
Teri deserves
better than that.

17:25.295 --> 17:27.829
I promised her we'd...

17:27.897 --> 17:29.299
Go to Tahiti.

17:29.366 --> 17:32.235
I'm gonna show you
something, man.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.374
You carry around
a picture of a watch?

17:38.442 --> 17:40.976
You want something,
you keep it close.

17:41.044 --> 17:42.745
That's the dumbest thing
I ever heard.

17:42.813 --> 17:44.313
Go ahead and make fun,
but when I hit it big,

17:44.380 --> 17:45.748
that's the first thing
I'm gonna do,

17:45.816 --> 17:47.416
is buy that watch
I just showed you.

17:47.484 --> 17:49.084
Then I want
to see your face.

17:49.152 --> 17:51.720
Come on, man,
first one's on me.

17:51.788 --> 17:54.424
Make your own luck.

17:54.491 --> 17:55.825
Come on.

18:00.931 --> 18:04.567
4 aces? Your mojo
is back big time!

18:04.634 --> 18:06.502
You make a deal
with the devil or what?

18:10.407 --> 18:14.443
Winner, winner,
chicken dinner.

18:14.511 --> 18:16.178
Hey.

18:16.246 --> 18:17.713
We're looking for a man
who's killing those

18:17.781 --> 18:20.016
who appear to prey upon
or take advantage of gamblers.

18:20.084 --> 18:22.452
Loan sharks
and call girls so far.

18:22.520 --> 18:25.088
The killings may have been
triggered by recent gambling losses.

18:25.156 --> 18:27.056
Our unsub
is physically fit.

18:27.124 --> 18:29.426
He was able to overpower
Danny Savino,

18:29.493 --> 18:32.128
and Patti Riolo was killed
with extreme violence.

18:32.196 --> 18:33.896
It's doubtful this person
has a criminal record.

18:33.964 --> 18:35.464
He moves without fear
of being recognized

18:35.532 --> 18:37.567
in one of the most surveilled
locales on the planet.

18:37.634 --> 18:40.235
He wouldn't have elements
of a domestic life, like children.

18:40.303 --> 18:43.072
That would only moderate
or stabilize his compulsive behavior.

18:43.139 --> 18:44.907
Pathological gambling
is the most common type

18:44.975 --> 18:47.109
of impulse control
disorder in the world.

18:47.177 --> 18:49.175
And there is no more
superstitious creature

18:49.200 --> 18:51.793
on earth than a gambler.
The number 8

18:51.794 --> 18:54.783
is the ritual aspect
to our unsub's signature.

18:54.784 --> 18:56.218
It's a compulsion.

18:56.286 --> 18:57.586
It could signify
a birthdate

18:57.654 --> 18:59.688
or an important time
in his life.

18:59.756 --> 19:02.057
Not only is this unsub
a killer but he's also an addict.

19:02.125 --> 19:03.859
He's killed twice
in the last two days

19:03.926 --> 19:05.727
and he may not
be able to stop.

19:05.795 --> 19:06.995
Thank you.

19:17.774 --> 19:19.375
You Jimmy?

19:20.377 --> 19:22.011
Over here.

19:32.255 --> 19:34.723
This doesn't make sense.
Danny Savino was a bottom-feeder,

19:34.791 --> 19:38.126
handing out nickel-and-dime
loans to to small-time gamblers.

19:38.194 --> 19:41.462
But Patti riolo was exclusively
about high-rollers.

19:41.530 --> 19:43.898
The unsub wouldn't have
naturally crossed into both worlds.

19:43.966 --> 19:45.299
He'd be in one
or the other.

19:45.367 --> 19:47.534
Unless his fortunes
changed drastically

19:47.602 --> 19:50.036
between murdering Savino
and meeting up with Patti riolo.

19:50.104 --> 19:52.305
Maybe he flashed
the money he stole from Savino

19:52.373 --> 19:54.540
in front of her,
pretended to be rich.

19:54.608 --> 19:56.209
Or he gambled
with it and won big.

19:56.276 --> 19:58.211
Let's say Dave's right.
He was in financial trouble

19:58.279 --> 20:00.480
and immediately after
murdering Savino, his luck changed.

20:00.548 --> 20:03.016
In his mind, he could
have connected the two.

20:03.083 --> 20:04.544
Every compulsive gambler

20:04.569 --> 20:06.692
believes in a system, 
no matter how illogical.

20:06.987 --> 20:08.037
And he'd figure the part

20:08.062 --> 20:09.856
of his system he'd been
missing was murder.

20:31.382 --> 20:33.751
Dealer shows 21.

20:33.818 --> 20:35.719
21 for the house.

20:40.525 --> 20:42.126
A cashier was shot
to death last night

20:42.194 --> 20:44.461
at a gas station
in town. And get this--

20:44.529 --> 20:47.598
$8.00 and an 8 card
left on his body.

20:52.537 --> 20:54.137
I don't get it.

20:54.205 --> 20:56.073
I lost practically
every hand.

20:56.140 --> 20:59.643
Hey, did you see that
Circle of 8 guy did it again?

21:01.245 --> 21:04.881
He gunned down some dude
in a gas station.

21:04.949 --> 21:06.082
Something's off.

21:06.150 --> 21:09.451
My system should have
worked, but it...didn't.

21:09.519 --> 21:11.687
Please tell me you didn't
gas up your car last night.

21:11.755 --> 21:12.921
What?

21:12.989 --> 21:14.356
Savino, that hooker.

21:14.423 --> 21:17.092
Seems like this guy was only
killing people who knew you.

21:23.933 --> 21:26.935
Anyway, too bad you didn't
get the 50 grand for the buy-in.

21:27.003 --> 21:29.437
Oh, no!

21:29.505 --> 21:31.773
Yo. You with me?

21:31.841 --> 21:33.842
Uh, meet me outside.
I gotta take care of something.

22:12.615 --> 22:14.583
Look at us, man.

22:14.650 --> 22:19.422
Top-shelf whiskey to 5-buck
hoagies one day to the next.

22:19.489 --> 22:21.824
We've been through it all,
you and me.

22:21.892 --> 22:24.227
Hey. It's for you.

22:24.295 --> 22:25.429
It's yours.

22:25.496 --> 22:26.430
Keep it.

22:26.497 --> 22:28.265
Mm-hmm.
You serious?

22:30.168 --> 22:32.002
Yeah.

22:32.070 --> 22:33.437
Nice.

22:33.505 --> 22:36.440
You were part of my system
and didn't even know it, huh?

22:36.508 --> 22:38.108
Well, you know
what they say.

22:38.176 --> 22:40.177
The reverse side also
has a reverse side.

22:40.244 --> 22:42.179
Yeah. Whatever the hell
that means.

22:42.246 --> 22:45.948
It means you're part of
my system, too, Eddie.

23:10.008 --> 23:12.743
$88. The unsub's
getting generous.

23:12.811 --> 23:14.444
There's less rage
than the others.

23:14.512 --> 23:17.582
And undoing.
There's evidence of remorse.

23:17.649 --> 23:20.317
Shot in the back so he wouldn't
have to face his victim.

23:20.385 --> 23:21.586
No robbery this time, either.

23:21.653 --> 23:23.989
Wallet's intact, except for
anything to I.D. him.

23:24.056 --> 23:25.390
Is this even
the same killer?

23:25.457 --> 23:27.592
The ritual's too similar
to discount it.

23:27.660 --> 23:29.694
The change in the M.O.
makes sense if the unsub

23:29.761 --> 23:31.496
is still refining
his system.

23:31.563 --> 23:34.132
Maybe killing the cashier
at the gas station didn't work,

23:34.200 --> 23:35.534
so he's back
to the drawing board.

23:35.601 --> 23:37.769
Two 8s instead of one
could also be significant.

23:37.837 --> 23:40.273
I know in China the number 8
symbolizes prosperity.

23:40.340 --> 23:42.775
The more 8s the better.
As a matter of fact, in Chungdu

23:42.843 --> 23:44.811
a telephone number
consisting of all 8s

23:44.879 --> 23:46.746
recently sold for over
a quarter million dollars.

23:46.814 --> 23:48.815
So why would he be
doubling up on his luck out here,

23:48.883 --> 23:51.117
away from all the casinos?

23:51.185 --> 23:52.452
There's been another killing.

23:52.520 --> 23:54.888
A guest in his room
at the Sapphire Lady.

23:54.956 --> 23:55.889
Same ritual?

23:55.957 --> 23:57.123
No. His neck was broken.

23:57.191 --> 23:58.524
And he was robbed
of 50,000.

23:58.592 --> 24:00.093
But the strange thing is,

24:00.160 --> 24:02.762
the killer left nearly
20,000 behind with the body.

24:02.830 --> 24:05.432
Garcia, is there a casino
in the neighborhood

24:05.499 --> 24:06.866
of Penrose
and Morningside Avenue?

24:06.934 --> 24:09.102
Uh...No casinos per se,

24:09.170 --> 24:11.080
but there's a private
gambling establishment

24:11.105 --> 24:12.305
right around the corner.

24:12.339 --> 24:13.273
Is it legal?

24:13.340 --> 24:16.143
Yeah. But it's ultra exclusive.

24:16.210 --> 24:18.779
They have a monthly
high-stakes poker tournament,

24:18.846 --> 24:21.181
today being the day for the month,
coincidentally enough.

24:21.249 --> 24:22.783
Or no coincidence at all.

24:22.850 --> 24:23.951
What's the buy-in?

24:24.018 --> 24:25.452
Um...Yikies.

24:25.520 --> 24:27.855
$50,000.

24:27.922 --> 24:29.690
But it's a million-dollar
guarantee if you win.

24:29.758 --> 24:31.091
What time does it start?

24:31.159 --> 24:32.426
Later this afternoon.

24:32.494 --> 24:34.194
Thanks.

24:34.262 --> 24:37.464
Forensics got a fingerprint
match on the last victim.

24:37.532 --> 24:39.967
Eddie Langdon.
We're looking into him.

24:40.035 --> 24:41.435
Hey, any luck?

24:41.503 --> 24:43.838
No, they don't want to allocate
agency funds for the buy-in.

24:43.905 --> 24:45.606
I'm still working on it.

24:45.674 --> 24:47.608
Well, I can't
imagine why not.

24:47.676 --> 24:50.477
We're only asking for 50,000
bucks of taxpayer money

24:50.545 --> 24:53.481
so that FBI agents
can play Texas hold 'em.

24:53.548 --> 24:54.648
Hey, what about you?

24:54.716 --> 24:55.850
What about me what?

24:55.917 --> 24:57.952
You could stake us
the buy-in.

24:58.020 --> 24:59.253
Yeah, you're
a best-selling author.

24:59.321 --> 25:01.322
Why not?
No.

25:01.390 --> 25:02.857
One, it's against regulations,

25:02.924 --> 25:05.326
and I'd like to hold on to this
job for a little while longer.

25:05.393 --> 25:07.795
It's a minor
administrative violation.

25:07.862 --> 25:09.529
And two, I prefer
to spend my money

25:09.597 --> 25:11.331
on actual things,

25:11.399 --> 25:14.167
like single-malt scotch,
a fine cigar,

25:14.234 --> 25:15.534
beautiful artwork.

25:15.602 --> 25:16.669
Poker chips are things.

25:16.736 --> 25:18.271
Maybe just think of it
as like a new experience.

25:18.338 --> 25:19.940
I mean, at your age,
how often does that happen?

25:20.007 --> 25:21.975
At my what?

25:22.043 --> 25:24.278
Rossi, this may be
our only chance

25:24.345 --> 25:25.612
to get this guy.

25:27.749 --> 25:29.016
All right. Fine.

25:29.084 --> 25:30.552
I'm a decent poker player.

25:30.619 --> 25:32.954
But I can't promise that I can
stay in the game long enough to--

25:33.022 --> 25:34.056
you know what?

25:34.123 --> 25:35.824
I bet you're
a great poker player,

25:35.892 --> 25:37.893
but what if
we sent in Reid?

25:37.961 --> 25:40.330
I am banned from casinos
in Las Vegas, Laughlin, and Parump

25:40.397 --> 25:41.965
because of my card-counting
ability.

25:42.033 --> 25:44.668
Look, I know I'm not a genius
like the boy wonder here,

25:44.736 --> 25:46.970
but poker is not Blackjack.
It's about bluffing,

25:47.038 --> 25:49.773
reading human nature,
head games.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.007
It's not math.

25:51.075 --> 25:52.342
That's not entirely accurate.

25:52.409 --> 25:54.076
There actually is
a mathematical equation

25:54.144 --> 25:56.579
for knowing when to raise
and when to fold.

25:56.647 --> 25:58.915
If P represents the size of the pot
at the time of play,

25:58.982 --> 26:01.551
then P times N minus one,

26:01.618 --> 26:03.719
with N representing the estimated
number of players

26:03.787 --> 26:05.088
in the final
round of betting--

26:05.155 --> 26:06.122
Ok, fine. I surrender.

26:06.190 --> 26:08.224
Just try not to lose
all of my money.

26:12.262 --> 26:13.964
I got it.

26:29.447 --> 26:30.781
Some of these guys
have records,

26:30.849 --> 26:32.216
but the don't fit
the profile.

26:32.283 --> 26:35.118
Keep looking
he's gotta be there.

26:35.186 --> 26:37.421
The last victim, Eddie Langdon,
was wearing a watch

26:37.489 --> 26:39.056
that was much too big
for his wrist.

26:39.124 --> 26:40.056
Could it be stolen?

26:40.124 --> 26:42.058
Or it was a gift
from the unsub.

26:42.126 --> 26:44.126
That fits, given the care
and remorse for the victim.

26:44.194 --> 26:45.327
Ok, the link is set.

26:45.352 --> 26:47.469
As soon as Reid triggers
the alarm, we can move in.

26:52.702 --> 26:54.002
Halitosis.

26:56.005 --> 26:57.806
Ok, got something for you.

26:57.874 --> 26:59.074
All right,
talk to me, mama.

26:59.142 --> 27:00.742
Eddie Langdon.
High school dropout,

27:00.810 --> 27:02.744
lots of odd jobs,
never married,

27:02.811 --> 27:05.113
lived at transient-type hotels
in and around Atlantic City.

27:05.181 --> 27:08.250
Started his own plumbing supply
business that went bankrupt.

27:08.318 --> 27:11.119
Was in jail for 6 months
in 2005 for forgery,

27:11.187 --> 27:13.654
and that's why we were able to
get a match on his prints so fast.

27:13.722 --> 27:16.390
You've always been fast,
baby girl.

27:16.458 --> 27:19.460
Uh, yeah. Gotta go.

27:23.230 --> 27:25.197
...queen.

27:50.523 --> 27:51.790
Flush to the king.

27:58.798 --> 28:00.799
I'll count it, sir.

28:22.290 --> 28:23.391
All in.

28:25.294 --> 28:28.496
You know, would it be all right
if I sat at table 2 instead of 4?

28:28.564 --> 28:29.813
I have a pre-glaucoma condition

28:29.838 --> 28:31.338
and the light's kind of
bothering my eyes.

28:31.367 --> 28:33.301
Thanks.

28:56.623 --> 29:00.059
Ah, I'm calling.

29:00.127 --> 29:01.060
I'll raise.

29:01.128 --> 29:02.729
8,000.

29:02.796 --> 29:04.397
$8,000. That's, uh,

29:04.465 --> 29:07.167
56 months wages for the
average person in Bangladesh.

29:07.235 --> 29:09.136
Kind of makes you think,
doesn't it?

29:10.638 --> 29:12.573
Hey, it's 8 thou to you.

29:12.641 --> 29:14.408
Now, are you in
or are you out?

29:14.476 --> 29:16.878
I...Am in.

29:16.945 --> 29:18.612
And I raise.

29:18.680 --> 29:21.215
3 raise.

29:21.283 --> 29:24.119
That's too rich
for my blood.

29:25.821 --> 29:27.422
Are you in, sir?

29:27.489 --> 29:29.157
I'll call.

29:31.793 --> 29:33.160
Call.

29:33.228 --> 29:34.628
Straight.

29:34.696 --> 29:37.597
A gut shot straight draw?
Are you kidding me?

29:37.665 --> 29:40.933
That is just--
that is nuts.

29:41.001 --> 29:44.337
That's crazy, man.

29:45.706 --> 29:48.074
Do you mind if I
take a look at this?

29:52.580 --> 29:53.680
Hey. What's
the problem, sir?

29:53.747 --> 29:54.847
Hey, he's reaching
for my chips.

29:54.915 --> 29:56.015
I was simply admiring--

29:56.083 --> 29:57.350
Sir, you need to come with me.

29:57.418 --> 29:58.618
You don't have to
manhandle--I can walk.

29:58.685 --> 30:00.887
I'll cooperate. Don't manhandle me.
Thanks.

30:07.828 --> 30:09.329
That's Reid. Let's go.

30:22.375 --> 30:23.642
He's an FBI Agent.

30:23.710 --> 30:25.744
There he goes. Plaid
shirt, baseball hat.

30:30.417 --> 30:32.061
Morgan, he's a white male,
baseball cap, he's headed

30:32.086 --> 30:33.286
towards the back door.

30:40.527 --> 30:42.061
He's on the move.

30:55.738 --> 30:57.239
We need to look at
victimology again.

30:57.307 --> 30:58.841
Ok, uh, Garcia said
that Eddie Langdon

30:58.908 --> 31:01.377
was a high-school dropout,
right? Chronic underachiever?

31:01.478 --> 31:02.545
What are you thinking?

31:02.612 --> 31:04.180
Well, does that sound
like someone

31:04.247 --> 31:06.182
who has the financial
know-how and business sense

31:06.249 --> 31:08.984
to start his own company
from scratch all by himself?

31:10.821 --> 31:12.889
Sir, you were right.

31:12.957 --> 31:15.258
Eddie Langdon did have a partner
in that plumbing supply business.

31:15.326 --> 31:18.762
Curtis Banks. And Banks pops up
more than once in Eddie's life.

31:18.830 --> 31:20.364
They shared an apartment
together.

31:20.431 --> 31:22.966
When Langdon was in jail
for that forgery charge,

31:23.034 --> 31:25.269
it was Banks who bailed him out.
Oh, there's more.

31:25.337 --> 31:27.438
Banks' dad was
a compulsive gambler, too.

31:27.506 --> 31:30.241
Won some sort
of big jackpot in 1988.

31:30.309 --> 31:31.709
The father abandoned
the family,

31:31.777 --> 31:34.511
ended up 6 months later
dead in a Las Vegas hotel room,

31:34.579 --> 31:36.146
completely broke.
Drank himself to death.

31:36.214 --> 31:37.781
Do you have an address
for Banks?

31:37.849 --> 31:39.916
Yeah. 800 Brigantine Road,
Galloway Township.

31:39.984 --> 31:41.384
That's 10 miles from
Atlantic City.

31:41.451 --> 31:42.885
Thanks.
Tell Reid and Morgan

31:42.953 --> 31:45.021
to go to Banks' house.
He may head back there.

32:04.709 --> 32:06.309
Yeah, Hotch,
there's nobody here.

32:06.377 --> 32:08.845
There's a foreclosure
sign on the front lawn.

32:08.912 --> 32:11.013
All right, you and Reid stay
there in case he comes back.

32:12.349 --> 32:13.682
Yeah, Dave.

32:13.750 --> 32:16.518
I think I know the final piece
of the unsub's system.

32:16.586 --> 32:17.986
We know
it involves violence.

32:18.054 --> 32:19.588
We know it involves
the number 8.

32:19.656 --> 32:20.855
But the killing
of the person

32:20.923 --> 32:22.323
at the gas station
didn't work.

32:22.391 --> 32:24.158
What about him was different
from his partner,

32:24.226 --> 32:26.660
his loan shark,
the call girl?

32:26.728 --> 32:28.863
He was a stranger.
There was no personal connection.

32:28.930 --> 32:31.532
Exactly. That's why before
the million-dollar game

32:31.600 --> 32:33.368
he killed his best friend.

32:33.435 --> 32:35.336
So the closer the relationship,
the better his luck.

32:35.403 --> 32:36.762
And now he's gonna need

32:36.787 --> 32:38.687
the biggest infusion of luck
he's ever gotten

32:38.740 --> 32:39.907
to escape this mess.

32:39.975 --> 32:42.276
He's going after
his wife.

32:49.286 --> 32:50.653
Curtis?

32:50.720 --> 32:53.188
What the hell?
What are you doing?

32:53.256 --> 32:56.992
Curtis! What are you
doing here?

32:57.060 --> 32:58.560
Curtis, you need to leave.

32:58.628 --> 33:01.029
We're leaving together.
We can do that now.

33:01.096 --> 33:02.530
Do what?

33:02.598 --> 33:03.898
Tahiti.

33:03.966 --> 33:05.733
Look.

33:06.801 --> 33:08.035
Poker chips?

33:08.102 --> 33:11.738
Uh, we'll get a boat,
we'll sail to Bora Bora,

33:11.805 --> 33:12.838
and then we'll just--
we'll--

33:12.873 --> 33:14.407
Curtis, we're not going
anywhere together.

33:14.474 --> 33:16.242
Don't you understand that?
Look, you're sick.

33:16.310 --> 33:17.237
We would get to Tahiti

33:17.262 --> 33:19.149
and you would find some
other reason to play cards.

33:19.713 --> 33:21.547
I'm gonna ask you
for the last time...

33:21.615 --> 33:22.982
Leave.

33:24.885 --> 33:27.887
Liz, call the police.

33:27.954 --> 33:28.921
No--oh--

33:28.989 --> 33:30.490
nobody's calling anyone.

33:32.726 --> 33:35.061
What are you doing?

33:35.129 --> 33:36.496
What are you doing?

33:37.931 --> 33:39.199
Sir, I found something.

33:39.266 --> 33:41.401
Teri Banks filed for divorce
two days ago.

33:41.469 --> 33:42.703
She wasn't at home.

33:42.771 --> 33:44.439
Does she have any relatives
or close friends nearby?

33:45.474 --> 33:48.042
Yeah, she has a sister,
Liz Dorsey,

33:48.110 --> 33:50.812
at 3388 Woodland Loop
in Northfield.

33:50.879 --> 33:51.879
Got it. Thanks.

33:56.418 --> 33:58.986
Babe, maybe you're right.

33:59.054 --> 34:01.555
Maybe we can still do this.

34:01.623 --> 34:03.557
Tahiti, right?

34:03.625 --> 34:06.159
Fresh start, you and me?

34:06.227 --> 34:09.295
You'd make a lousy gambler,
Teri.

34:09.362 --> 34:12.032
No poker face.

34:14.402 --> 34:17.371
Now you're just trying to stop
what has to happen.

34:39.161 --> 34:41.630
- There's his car.
- He's in there.

34:42.864 --> 34:46.768
Let me go in
and talk to him, Aaron.

34:46.835 --> 34:48.268
I know how
these guys think.

34:48.337 --> 34:50.137
All right.

34:54.376 --> 34:57.478
JJ, see if you can
get an angle on Banks.

35:09.224 --> 35:10.491
Hotch, he's got a gun.

35:10.559 --> 35:12.460
He's holding
two females hostage.

35:12.528 --> 35:13.995
I don't have
a clear shot here.

35:14.062 --> 35:15.896
I'm gonna go around the side.

35:21.269 --> 35:23.237
I'm unarmed.

35:23.338 --> 35:24.705
I'm unarmed.
Hey!

35:24.772 --> 35:27.340
Who the hell are you?
Come here. Come here, come here.

35:27.408 --> 35:31.477
I'm Agent Rossi
with the FBI.

35:31.545 --> 35:34.114
If you move,
she is dead.

35:35.183 --> 35:37.385
The house is surrounded.

35:37.452 --> 35:40.721
Now, you know there's only one way
out of this, Curtis.

35:40.789 --> 35:43.758
You have to let
the women go

35:43.826 --> 35:46.661
and I'll take their place.

35:46.728 --> 35:49.197
Now, I've seen a lot of killers
in my life, Curtis,

35:49.265 --> 35:51.366
but you're not like them.

35:51.434 --> 35:54.135
You stumbled into this mess.

35:54.203 --> 35:57.505
I can help
get you out of it.

35:57.573 --> 36:00.642
But you need to let them go.

36:03.412 --> 36:06.314
Get out of here. Go.
Move!

36:08.751 --> 36:11.519
Sorry.

36:16.927 --> 36:19.195
Ok. That's good.

36:19.262 --> 36:21.998
You've made smart decisions,
Curtis, like I knew you would.

36:22.065 --> 36:23.332
Now, is this your wife?

36:23.400 --> 36:24.333
She stays.

36:24.401 --> 36:25.601
You don't want
to hurt her, son.

36:25.669 --> 36:26.769
She's not the problem.

36:26.837 --> 36:28.104
Well, that's where
you're wrong.

36:28.172 --> 36:31.774
She never believed in me
and what I do.

36:31.842 --> 36:34.277
And when I had good luck,
she ruined it.

36:34.345 --> 36:37.681
She's not the reason,
Curtis.

36:37.748 --> 36:40.417
It was your father.

36:44.355 --> 36:47.357
There's no such thing
as manufacturing luck.

36:47.425 --> 36:49.259
The same obsession
is what killed him.

36:49.327 --> 36:51.294
He passed it on to you,

36:51.362 --> 36:54.831
but you don't need
to be like him.

36:59.437 --> 37:01.639
I just need some time.
I need some time, ok?

37:01.707 --> 37:03.474
Just give me a minute
to think.

37:03.542 --> 37:04.609
That's fine.

37:15.689 --> 37:18.257
Hotch, he moved
to the back room.

37:18.325 --> 37:19.792
I still don't have a shot.

37:19.859 --> 37:21.026
Sit down.

37:22.028 --> 37:23.429
I need just a minute.

37:23.496 --> 37:25.097
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

37:30.536 --> 37:33.605
Rossi, he keeps glancing
to his left. What's over there?

37:35.541 --> 37:37.109
I see it now.

37:37.177 --> 37:39.145
See what?
What do you see, huh?

37:39.212 --> 37:42.815
I see why you feel
time is running out.

37:42.882 --> 37:46.619
Sand is slipping through
the hourglass.

37:46.686 --> 37:48.554
It's 7:58. That's why
he's asking for more time.

37:48.622 --> 37:51.123
He's waiting for 8:00.
Let's go.

37:56.296 --> 37:59.065
I've always loved you, Teri.

37:59.132 --> 38:00.866
Even though you fought me.

38:02.235 --> 38:04.337
Whatever's next...

38:04.404 --> 38:06.505
We're doing it together.

38:06.573 --> 38:09.008
No, baby, pl-please
don't do this.

38:09.076 --> 38:11.043
No, no!
Curtis, let her go.

38:12.946 --> 38:15.213
We love each other.

38:15.281 --> 38:16.648
This is our dream.

38:16.716 --> 38:18.516
Together.

38:18.584 --> 38:20.218
Curtis, let her go.

38:38.904 --> 38:43.409
All right, Curtis, very slowly put
the weapon on the ground.

38:47.849 --> 38:50.417
I guess it is true
what they say.

38:52.953 --> 38:55.021
The house always wins.

39:01.260 --> 39:02.393
No!

39:19.211 --> 39:21.379
George Augustus Sala said,

39:21.447 --> 39:23.047
"a gambler with a system

39:23.115 --> 39:28.053
"must be, to a greater
or lesser extent, insane."

39:32.225 --> 39:34.459
Hi, miss thing.

39:34.527 --> 39:36.661
Enough is enough.

39:36.729 --> 39:41.098
It's time for you and me
to have a little sit-down.

39:41.166 --> 39:43.067
What's going on with you?

39:43.134 --> 39:45.369
Half the time I call
I get your voicemail.

39:45.437 --> 39:47.610
When I do get you,
I don't get even a little bit

39:47.635 --> 39:48.835
of sass coming my way.

39:48.840 --> 39:50.841
Now, what's the deal?

39:50.908 --> 39:52.175
Hello!

39:52.243 --> 39:55.011
Ok. Look. I get it that men
and women are different

39:55.079 --> 39:56.513
and Venus and Mars
and all that stuff,

39:56.581 --> 39:57.781
but I do not understand
how you--

39:57.849 --> 40:00.684
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Pump your brakes.

40:00.752 --> 40:02.153
What is this about?

40:04.490 --> 40:07.592
You were in my shower
at 7:00 in the morning.

40:07.660 --> 40:11.096
Because I shower
at 7:00 in the morning.

40:11.164 --> 40:14.165
Baby, you had a little too much
to drink the other night.

40:14.233 --> 40:16.267
You called me to come over
and keep you company.

40:16.335 --> 40:17.701
I know.
I remember that, but--

40:17.769 --> 40:20.337
Ok, what happened between us
was popcorn.

40:20.405 --> 40:22.006
And a movie on TV.

40:22.073 --> 40:25.209
Which you fell asleep
in the middle of, by the way.

40:25.277 --> 40:26.544
So you slept on the--

40:26.611 --> 40:28.446
Couch.
Yes, you did.

40:28.513 --> 40:29.880
Oh, thank you.

40:29.948 --> 40:33.283
Oh, thank you, God,
for maintaining the integrity

40:33.318 --> 40:35.553
of my most beloved
of friendships,

40:35.620 --> 40:38.555
and from now on,
I promise only mostly

40:38.623 --> 40:41.326
the purest of mineral water
will cross these lips.

40:41.394 --> 40:42.894
Hey, plum sauce,
are you coming?

40:42.961 --> 40:44.195
Yeah.
I'll be right there.

40:44.263 --> 40:46.898
Hey, what's up, man?
Hey, Derek.

40:46.966 --> 40:48.566
Since the fight,
we have decided

40:48.634 --> 40:50.668
to have a standing date
every Tuesday night.

40:50.736 --> 40:53.338
Good luck with that
with this job.

40:53.406 --> 40:56.407
You got a great guy out there.
You know that, right?

40:56.475 --> 40:59.010
I know.

40:59.078 --> 41:01.712
What does a girl do
when she has two great guys?

41:01.780 --> 41:03.881
She doesn't pour
that extra glass of wine.

41:03.949 --> 41:05.850
Oh. Yeah.

41:05.918 --> 41:08.152
Mmm.

41:08.220 --> 41:10.855
Ok, love you, bye.

41:13.925 --> 41:16.126
Plum sauce?
