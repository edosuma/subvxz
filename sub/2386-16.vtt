00:04.059 --> 00:05.797
Sorry this is
taking so long.

00:05.798 --> 00:08.166
He kicked for everybody else.

00:08.167 --> 00:10.468
It's hard for the little guy
to perform under pressure.

00:10.470 --> 00:12.654
Top ten things Marshall
said on his wedding night.

00:13.907 --> 00:15.640
Whoa! It was small, but
I think I felt something.

00:15.642 --> 00:18.142
Top ten things Lily said
on her wedding night.

00:18.144 --> 00:20.111
Stop laughing
at it, Lily.

00:20.113 --> 00:22.146
Top ten things Marshall said
on his wedding night!

00:22.148 --> 00:23.331
Can we please talk
about something

00:23.333 --> 00:24.449
other than my wedding night?

00:24.451 --> 00:26.951
Absolutely. Let's talk
about last night.

00:26.953 --> 00:29.320
It was a night
like any other.

00:29.322 --> 00:31.322
I was just about
to get laid...

00:31.324 --> 00:33.541
Hey, Barney,
I need your help.

00:33.543 --> 00:35.176
This hottie I'm talking to
is meeting her friend

00:35.178 --> 00:36.628
at a club,
so I need a wingman.

00:36.630 --> 00:39.013
Well, just so you know, I'd be
giving up a sure thing here.

00:39.015 --> 00:40.098
Hey!

00:40.100 --> 00:41.933
Are you <i>not</i> a sure thing?

00:41.935 --> 00:44.269
Yeah, I am.

00:45.638 --> 00:47.689
This "friend" of yours
better be even hotter

00:47.691 --> 00:49.190
and dumber than this one.

00:49.192 --> 00:52.677
Wow! You have Enormous
Penis Syndrome?

00:52.679 --> 00:54.729
I've never heard of that.
Yeah.

00:54.731 --> 00:57.115
That's the problem with E.P.S.:
lack of awareness.

00:57.117 --> 00:59.150
That's why I'm
organizing a 10K fun-run.

00:59.152 --> 01:02.720
Of course, many of us
will need wheelbarrows.

01:02.722 --> 01:05.022
You are so brave.

01:05.024 --> 01:07.024
And you are so understanding.

01:07.026 --> 01:08.993
Most people
just stare at me

01:08.995 --> 01:11.963
like I'm some kind of freak
in reinforced underwear.

01:11.965 --> 01:13.798
Poor, baby.

01:13.800 --> 01:15.667
I can't imagine
what you're going through

01:15.669 --> 01:17.201
because I never wear underwear.

01:17.203 --> 01:18.553
Jackpot!

01:18.555 --> 01:20.037
You want to get out of here?

01:20.039 --> 01:22.640
Oh, I don't know. This is all
moving kind of fast. Okay.

01:22.642 --> 01:24.142
Oh, but before we go,

01:24.144 --> 01:26.094
I should mention my condition.

01:26.096 --> 01:29.597
It's called: I'm Not
a Gullible Dumbass Disorder.

01:29.599 --> 01:31.933
As the former Surgeon General,
I've got to say,

01:31.935 --> 01:33.851
I don't think
that's the real thing.

01:33.853 --> 01:35.103
Okay, just stop.

01:35.105 --> 01:36.554
You have no chance with me.

01:36.556 --> 01:38.523
We're just here as backups
for our friends.

01:38.525 --> 01:39.657
Hey, how did you two meet,
anyway?

01:39.659 --> 01:41.576
No, we're not doing
that first date dance

01:41.578 --> 01:43.278
where you pretend everything
I say is fascinating,

01:43.280 --> 01:45.947
thinking it'll somehow
get you into my pants.

01:45.949 --> 01:47.865
What? Guys don't do that!

01:47.867 --> 01:49.918
Goat cheese?
Fascinating!

01:49.920 --> 01:52.203
What else
are you allergic to, huh?

01:53.522 --> 01:56.407
You owe me three hours
for last night, Mosby.

01:56.409 --> 01:58.042
I'm thinking,

01:58.044 --> 02:01.379
laser tag tournament
in Newark this weekend.

02:01.381 --> 02:03.414
Ted can pass for
under 18, right?

02:03.416 --> 02:04.716
It's a father-son thing.

02:04.718 --> 02:06.601
Marshall, we should
get going. Any later,

02:06.603 --> 02:08.652
and we'll be riding the Drunk Train.
Oh.

02:08.655 --> 02:09.470
The Drunk Train?

02:09.472 --> 02:11.021
It's the last train
of the night

02:11.024 --> 02:12.507
back to Long Island.
It's a mess.

02:12.509 --> 02:13.858
Just a bunch of drunk,

02:13.860 --> 02:17.295
sloppy idiots, fresh off a
night of partying in the city,

02:17.297 --> 02:20.231
just desperate to hook up
with anything that moves.

02:20.233 --> 02:21.149
Yeah.
Bye.

02:21.151 --> 02:22.533
See you.

02:22.535 --> 02:24.786
New plan, Ted.

02:24.788 --> 02:26.821
So this father-son thing.

02:26.823 --> 02:29.540
You know, a backwards baseball
cap really youngs me down.

02:29.542 --> 02:30.625
All aboard!

02:50.276 --> 02:52.359
Mmm.

02:52.361 --> 02:54.778
16 years together,
and still so in love.

02:54.780 --> 02:56.262
- Mm.
- What's your secret?

02:56.264 --> 02:58.765
The key to relationships is
understanding the difference

02:58.767 --> 03:00.617
between hearing
and listening.

03:00.619 --> 03:02.035
It's about respecting
your partner's...

03:02.037 --> 03:03.203
Opinions on...

03:03.205 --> 03:05.789
Hey, shh, shh, shh.
Kind of on a roll here.

03:05.791 --> 03:08.608
Relationships are
a give and take,

03:08.610 --> 03:12.663
and that's why it's important
to never keep score.

03:12.665 --> 03:13.647
Yeah, like how

03:13.649 --> 03:14.881
Barney's holding
these three hours

03:14.883 --> 03:15.999
over Ted's head.

03:16.001 --> 03:18.218
If they were a couple,
they'd never work.

03:18.220 --> 03:21.621
Obviously. Ted's a Taurus,
and Barney is such a Scorpio.

03:21.623 --> 03:22.956
Good advice.
Don't keep score.

03:22.958 --> 03:24.725
They're not even
close to finished.

03:24.727 --> 03:26.014
How do we not keep
score, you ask?

03:26.039 --> 03:26.728
Huh. Hm.

03:26.729 --> 03:29.558
Sounds like somebody want
to hear some examples, sweetie.

03:29.583 --> 03:30.264
Mm-hmm.

03:30.265 --> 03:32.766
I'm just gonna close my
eyes until it's all over.

03:32.768 --> 03:34.968
Top ten things Lily said
on her wedding night.

03:34.970 --> 03:36.853
Solid.

03:36.855 --> 03:38.071
Here's one.

03:38.073 --> 03:40.357
Every time Marshall's
mom comes to visit us,

03:40.359 --> 03:43.694
<i>we have to put out all</i>
<i>the tacky Minnesota gifts</i>

03:43.696 --> 03:46.146
she's bought us over the years.

03:46.148 --> 03:48.148
Hi, Mom!
Hi, Mrs. Eriksen!

03:48.150 --> 03:50.417
Marshall.

03:51.652 --> 03:54.454
Uh-huh. I don't see

03:54.456 --> 03:57.758
the gopher-hair tea cozy
I made you.

03:57.760 --> 04:00.344
Guess it wasn't
good enough for Lily.

04:00.346 --> 04:02.546
But I'd never hold
that over Marshall,

04:02.548 --> 04:05.165
because if I did,
he'd owe me big-time.

04:05.167 --> 04:07.718
Just like I would never
hold it over you

04:07.720 --> 04:11.438
for dragging me to that
experimental theater piece.

04:19.697 --> 04:21.982
Is it... is it
just screaming?

04:23.985 --> 04:26.236
But we don't keep score.

04:26.238 --> 04:28.354
Gotcha, loud and clear.
Don't keep score.

04:28.356 --> 04:30.407
Because if we did, then
Marshall would owe me

04:30.409 --> 04:32.042
for killing my
cousin's dog.

04:32.044 --> 04:34.194
How did I know
that he would eat my wallet?

04:34.196 --> 04:36.413
Why was your wallet filled
with chocolate?!

04:36.415 --> 04:38.882
So we're back
to this argument!

04:38.884 --> 04:41.034
<i>That night, Barney</i>
<i>and I found ourselves</i>

04:41.036 --> 04:43.536
<i>in a strange,</i>
<i>new universe called...</i>

04:43.538 --> 04:44.871
<i>The Drunk Train.</i>

04:44.873 --> 04:46.807
Hey!

04:49.977 --> 04:53.814
Where has this heavenly vehicle
been all my life?

04:53.816 --> 04:56.349
Can you hear
its inspiring chant, Ted?

04:56.351 --> 04:59.986
I think I can get laid,
I think I can get laid.

04:59.988 --> 05:02.105
It's-it's The Little Engine
with Wood,

05:02.107 --> 05:04.024
The Whore-ient Express.

05:04.026 --> 05:05.391
The Long Island Tail Road!

05:05.393 --> 05:07.411
Oh, I got one.

05:07.413 --> 05:08.912
Thomas the Spank Engine!

05:08.914 --> 05:11.331
Ted, that is a children's book.

05:15.069 --> 05:17.287
Okay, as fun as this
place is, it's late.

05:17.289 --> 05:18.338
So, what's our play?

05:18.340 --> 05:19.756
And don't say, "The
Siamese Twins""

05:19.758 --> 05:21.908
We're not stretching out
another one of my jackets.

05:21.910 --> 05:23.927
No, dude, this is
the Drunk Train.

05:23.929 --> 05:25.128
We don't need a play!

05:25.130 --> 05:27.798
All we have to do is sit back,
play it cool,

05:27.800 --> 05:30.467
scope out the hotties,
and by the end of the line,

05:30.469 --> 05:33.586
we will totally be
sleeping with someone.

05:39.444 --> 05:42.062
You know,
you are so great.

05:42.064 --> 05:44.614
You sat there listening
to Marshall and Lily

05:44.616 --> 05:47.100
bicker all night,
and you didn't complain once.

05:47.102 --> 05:49.369
Well, I am a therapist,
so I do plan on billing them.

05:49.371 --> 05:52.605
I also have a couple powerful
medications that might help.

05:52.607 --> 05:53.907
Lily can't take anything;
she's pregnant.

05:53.909 --> 05:55.375
I meant for us.

05:55.377 --> 05:56.960
If we're getting through
five more meals

05:56.962 --> 05:58.628
and a sleigh ride
with those guys,

05:58.630 --> 06:00.130
we need to be spaced out
of our gourds.

06:00.132 --> 06:02.132
Well, if we are keeping score,

06:02.134 --> 06:04.617
I owe you one weekend, mister.

06:04.619 --> 06:06.452
I was thinking
a little longer than that.

06:06.454 --> 06:08.638
What do you mean?

06:10.892 --> 06:14.227
Robin, will you marry me?

06:20.723 --> 06:22.107
Look, I know this is fast.

06:22.109 --> 06:24.309
I'm just excited
to start a life with you.

06:24.311 --> 06:25.727
If that's what you want.

06:27.280 --> 06:29.281
Wow.

06:29.283 --> 06:31.032
Um...

06:31.034 --> 06:33.702
I'm-I'm not saying no.

06:33.704 --> 06:36.020
I'm-I'm not saying anything.

06:36.022 --> 06:39.408
I just, um...
I-I need some time to think.

06:39.410 --> 06:40.742
I totally understand.

06:40.744 --> 06:42.794
Um, take as much time
as you need.

06:42.796 --> 06:46.715
I'll just, uh... I'll just keep
this here until you're ready.

06:54.474 --> 06:56.758
Any chance we could put
that bad boy away for now?

06:56.760 --> 06:59.594
It's really just staring
at us, isn't it?

06:59.596 --> 07:02.264
Ted! Ted! Ted!

07:02.266 --> 07:04.599
I thought of some new
great names for the Drunk Train.

07:04.601 --> 07:05.817
Slamtrak!

07:05.819 --> 07:06.768
Uh-huh.

07:06.770 --> 07:09.438
The Chatta-Nookie Choo-Choo!

07:09.440 --> 07:12.056
Thomas the Spank Engine!
I said that one yesterday.

07:12.058 --> 07:14.075
I don't think you did.

07:14.077 --> 07:16.077
Wow. Someone's had some coffee.

07:16.079 --> 07:17.562
Yeah. 18 cups!

07:17.564 --> 07:20.248
There is no way
I'm falling asleep tonight!

07:20.250 --> 07:22.784
That Quinn girl is so wrong.

07:22.786 --> 07:24.786
She said I could never
love anything,

07:24.788 --> 07:26.922
but I love this train!

07:26.924 --> 07:29.574
She said you could never
love anything? That's intense.

07:29.576 --> 07:31.960
Oh, you have no idea.

07:34.247 --> 07:35.964
Stop staring.
Not gonna happen.

07:35.966 --> 07:39.083
Is there any way we can start
over and get to know each other?

07:39.085 --> 07:42.053
I already know you.
Oh, really?

07:42.055 --> 07:44.856
- You wear a suit all the time.
- Obviously.

07:44.858 --> 07:46.224
You have a stupid rule
about everything.

07:46.226 --> 07:48.059
I pay for the meal,
you handle my deal.

07:48.061 --> 07:49.277
That's just good manners.

07:49.279 --> 07:51.696
But you end most nights
alone at a strip club,

07:51.698 --> 07:53.281
feeling empty inside,
telling yourself

07:53.283 --> 07:57.869
your life is somehow epic
or classic or... legendary.

07:57.871 --> 08:01.456
I never say epic or classic.

08:01.458 --> 08:03.875
Do you practice the dark arts?

08:05.127 --> 08:06.895
No, they did not
forget the potato salad

08:06.897 --> 08:08.964
in your takeout order!

08:08.966 --> 08:10.999
Wh-What happened next?!

08:11.001 --> 08:12.617
For the last time, I'm sorry.

08:12.619 --> 08:13.952
It's okay.

08:13.954 --> 08:15.253
Your debt is paid.

08:15.255 --> 08:17.839
You don't have to come
on the Drunk Train anymore.

08:17.841 --> 08:19.508
You're never gonna meet
the one there, anyway.

08:19.510 --> 08:21.760
- Oh, screw the one!
- What?

08:21.762 --> 08:24.346
Every date I've been on lately
has been brutal.

08:24.348 --> 08:26.264
Last week, I went out
with a girl

08:26.266 --> 08:28.266
whose favorite band was <i>Glee.</i>

08:28.268 --> 08:29.634
Plus, it's almost
Valentine's Day,

08:29.636 --> 08:32.470
and I'm alone without
anything close to a girlfriend.

08:32.472 --> 08:35.190
So... all aboard!

08:35.192 --> 08:39.443
I have never been more proud
of you.

08:39.446 --> 08:41.413
Come on.

08:41.414 --> 08:43.648
Ted, tonight is gonna be epic--

08:43.650 --> 08:46.585
wait for it-- dary! Wait.

08:46.587 --> 08:47.702
No, that's not it.

08:47.704 --> 08:50.005
How do I usually say it?
I hate this Quinn girl!

08:51.891 --> 08:54.259
Well,

08:54.261 --> 08:55.961
I propose we order
a bottle of wine.

08:55.963 --> 08:57.846
- Propose!
- Not propose. Suggest.

08:57.848 --> 09:00.048
I'm not married to the idea.
Lily, take it.

09:00.050 --> 09:02.217
Why don't we get an appetizer?

09:02.219 --> 09:04.719
How about the...
onion rings?

09:04.721 --> 09:05.687
I mean, diamond rings.

09:05.689 --> 09:07.939
I mean,
diamond circles.

09:07.941 --> 09:09.608
I mean, <i>onion</i> circles.

09:09.610 --> 09:10.775
I know they're fattening,

09:10.777 --> 09:13.194
but I hear this place
has great onion circles.

09:13.196 --> 09:16.681
So, Robin,
about not telling them?

09:18.401 --> 09:21.336
The green salad
looks interesting.

09:22.905 --> 09:24.706
You're so much better
without him.

09:24.708 --> 09:27.409
If you ask me,
Vinnie's a real jerk.

09:27.411 --> 09:29.160
Hey, don't you dare
badmouth Vinnie!

09:29.162 --> 09:30.495
Ow!

09:30.497 --> 09:31.713
So what do you do?

09:31.715 --> 09:33.965
Well, I teach architecture,
and I also...

09:33.967 --> 09:35.216
Oh, big man with a job.

09:35.218 --> 09:36.585
You think yore better than me?

09:36.587 --> 09:37.752
What...

09:40.506 --> 09:42.507
So... where do you live?

09:42.509 --> 09:43.892
I'm on the
Upper West Side.

09:43.894 --> 09:46.428
Oh, big man.
Living in Manhattan.

09:46.430 --> 09:48.513
What, you think you're
better than me?

09:48.515 --> 09:50.398
Ehhh!

09:54.236 --> 09:56.605
Ehhhh!

09:56.607 --> 09:58.389
You think you're
better than me?!

09:59.909 --> 10:01.493
Well, it's a close one.

10:01.495 --> 10:04.195
Lily made 14 awkward
references to marriage,

10:04.197 --> 10:05.447
and Marshall made an even 60.

10:05.449 --> 10:07.866
I'm so sorry, Kevin.

10:07.868 --> 10:09.534
It's okay. I'm gonna
go to bed, but

10:09.536 --> 10:11.670
you guys think tomorrow we can
stop with all the marriage talk?

10:11.672 --> 10:12.737
I do.
I do.

10:12.739 --> 10:15.073
That's a half a point each.

10:15.075 --> 10:16.374
See you in a minute.

10:16.376 --> 10:18.126
Okay.

10:18.128 --> 10:19.410
So?

10:19.412 --> 10:21.930
Are you any closer to deciding?
Ooh...

10:21.932 --> 10:26.551
Uh... well, there is something
you don't know.

10:26.553 --> 10:28.086
Um...

10:28.088 --> 10:29.304
Can you guys keep a secret?

10:29.306 --> 10:31.556
Yeah.
Well, some of us can.

10:32.558 --> 10:33.775
Well, there's something

10:33.777 --> 10:36.061
I have been keeping
from everyone

10:36.063 --> 10:37.779
for the last couple of months.

10:38.814 --> 10:39.948
Um...

10:39.950 --> 10:42.984
I found out that
I can't have children.

10:46.906 --> 10:48.456
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

10:48.458 --> 10:49.492
Are you okay?

10:49.517 --> 10:50.917
I can't believe
that we didn't know.

10:50.961 --> 10:52.544
No, you know,
I've had some...

10:52.546 --> 10:55.914
time to deal with this
by myself, and...

10:55.916 --> 10:57.082
I'm okay.

10:57.084 --> 10:58.216
For real.

10:58.218 --> 10:59.501
Are you sure?

10:59.503 --> 11:01.636
Yeah. So...

11:01.638 --> 11:03.722
even though I love Kevin

11:03.724 --> 11:06.558
and I... think
I want to say yes,

11:06.560 --> 11:08.593
I can't until I tell him.

11:08.595 --> 11:09.561
But I'm scared

11:09.563 --> 11:10.795
it'll end our relationship.

11:10.797 --> 11:12.097
You
know what, Robin?

11:12.099 --> 11:15.066
If it's meant to be,
then it won't matter.

11:15.068 --> 11:17.802
Yeah, you just
have to tell him.

11:19.438 --> 11:22.607
Thank God we had the keys
to Marshall and Lily's place.

11:22.609 --> 11:25.309
Pretty sure I told you that before
you kicked in that side window.

11:25.311 --> 11:30.081
You mean, before the "burglars"
kicked in that side window

11:30.083 --> 11:33.034
and stole all
of Lily's underwear.

11:34.004 --> 11:36.504
What the hell happened
on that train?

11:36.506 --> 11:38.506
It was absolute chaos.

11:38.508 --> 11:42.093
Ted, when I was at M.I.T.,
my favorite Einstein quote was:

11:42.095 --> 11:44.679
"God doesn't play dice
with the universe."

11:44.681 --> 11:46.081
You didn't go to M.I.T.

11:46.083 --> 11:48.499
I didn't?

11:48.501 --> 11:52.470
Huh. I actually have no idea
where you went to college.

11:53.305 --> 11:55.273
Who are you?

11:55.275 --> 11:59.561
If we analyze the seemingly
random patterns of the train,

11:59.563 --> 12:02.013
taking into account
standard deviation,

12:02.015 --> 12:04.866
and assuming that
epsilon approaches zero

12:04.868 --> 12:06.868
as angle delta approaches pi,

12:06.870 --> 12:08.903
we can conclude...

12:10.690 --> 12:12.490
Damn it, Ted!

12:12.492 --> 12:15.543
I was about to drop some
sweet word play about logarithms

12:15.545 --> 12:18.213
and getting into a rhythm
with my log.

12:18.215 --> 12:20.799
I'll remember it.

12:20.801 --> 12:23.718
<i>The next morning, Robin</i>
<i>mustered up all her courage</i>

12:23.720 --> 12:25.837
<i>and finally told Kevin</i>
<i>her secret.</i>

12:25.839 --> 12:28.923
I know that this is a
lot to process, so...

12:28.925 --> 12:30.975
you take all the
time you need.

12:30.977 --> 12:34.229
And I understand...
Robin...

12:34.231 --> 12:36.631
will you marry me?

12:36.633 --> 12:38.716
Yes.

12:45.775 --> 12:46.617
What are you doing?

12:46.718 --> 12:48.835
The top speed of the Drunk Train
is 73 miles per hour,

12:48.837 --> 12:52.005
and you factor in an aggregate
of 32 boobs per car,

12:52.007 --> 12:54.141
28 of which are motorboatable,

12:54.143 --> 12:56.476
and you divide that...
No, no, no!

12:56.478 --> 12:58.678
This is all wrong!

12:59.347 --> 13:01.714
It should be so simple!

13:01.716 --> 13:04.651
I mean, it's the Drunk Train!

13:04.653 --> 13:08.271
My God...
it's been

13:08.273 --> 13:10.874
right in front of us
the whole time.

13:12.000 --> 13:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here

13:27.592 --> 13:28.875
"Get drunk""

13:28.877 --> 13:29.876
Yeah.

13:29.878 --> 13:31.244
Of course.

13:31.246 --> 13:33.713
Good circling, Ted.

13:33.715 --> 13:36.216
This ain't my first
word search.

13:38.853 --> 13:41.188
So my Mom's already
picked a date, venue

13:41.190 --> 13:42.689
and caterer for
the wedding.

13:42.691 --> 13:44.524
But nothing's
set in stone.

13:44.526 --> 13:45.859
My great-aunt's gonna sing.

13:45.861 --> 13:47.477
That's happening.

13:47.479 --> 13:49.062
Are you really okay with this?

13:49.064 --> 13:50.730
Yeah, she's actually got
a decent voice.

13:50.732 --> 13:53.567
No, are you... are you okay

13:53.569 --> 13:55.702
with everything
that we talked about?

13:55.704 --> 13:57.904
Of course, Robin, I love you.

13:57.906 --> 14:00.790
Besides, there are other ways
to have kids.

14:00.792 --> 14:02.075
There's adoption, surrogacy...

14:02.077 --> 14:05.745
No, Kevin, it's not just
that I can't have kids,

14:05.747 --> 14:07.814
I don't want kids.

14:07.816 --> 14:10.467
Oh.

14:10.469 --> 14:12.002
Okay.

14:12.004 --> 14:16.256
Knowing that, do you want
to take your proposal back?

14:16.258 --> 14:18.441
Will you marry me?

14:18.443 --> 14:21.628
Oh, you take such good care
of me.

14:21.630 --> 14:23.964
Thanks for loaning me your shoes

14:23.966 --> 14:25.849
for my swollen feet. Ah!

14:25.851 --> 14:27.150
I owe you one.

14:27.152 --> 14:28.652
We have to stop this.

14:28.654 --> 14:29.769
Stop what?

14:29.771 --> 14:31.938
Keeping score.

14:32.940 --> 14:36.243
You're growing a baby,
our baby.

14:36.245 --> 14:39.996
So you're officially ahead
of me for life.

14:39.998 --> 14:42.532
Oh, thanks, sweetie.

14:42.534 --> 14:46.036
Once we're parents,
we have to be a team. Deal?

14:46.038 --> 14:47.854
It's your turn!

14:47.856 --> 14:50.757
I was on point for six straight
hours yesterday!

14:50.759 --> 14:53.960
Two of those hours
were a nap and you know it!

14:53.962 --> 14:55.762
Let's go to the board!

14:58.799 --> 15:02.035
I hope
it's a soupy deuce, sucka.

15:04.356 --> 15:06.640
Deal. We're a team.

15:10.144 --> 15:13.730
I was all, "Do I look like
I'm from Ronkonkoma?!"

15:13.732 --> 15:15.682
Oh...!

15:15.684 --> 15:17.150
That's all you gotta say!

15:17.152 --> 15:18.902
Oh, oh, oh, big man
with a briefcase!

15:18.904 --> 15:20.737
What do you think,
you're better than me?!

15:23.208 --> 15:24.691
Hey, our stop's next.

15:24.693 --> 15:26.042
Do you want to join us?

15:26.044 --> 15:28.628
Yeah, I think we do.
Nah, we're good.

15:28.630 --> 15:30.196
Too skanky.

15:30.198 --> 15:32.082
Too skanky?
Eh...

15:32.084 --> 15:33.383
It's the Drunk Train.

15:33.385 --> 15:35.385
You crossed out
all the stops

15:35.387 --> 15:36.703
and wrote "Vaginaville."

15:36.705 --> 15:38.972
That's not true.

15:38.974 --> 15:41.508
That one says "Boner Gardens."

15:41.510 --> 15:44.043
What's going on?

15:44.045 --> 15:48.281
Wait. Did that Quinn girl shake
your game or something?

15:48.283 --> 15:50.150
Hell no!

15:50.152 --> 15:51.985
At the end of the night...

15:51.987 --> 15:53.269
You know,
I went out tonight

15:53.271 --> 15:56.323
looking for a cheap,
meaningless fling.

15:56.325 --> 15:59.192
But you turned out
to be so special.

15:59.194 --> 16:01.861
I'd hate to ruin this
friendship with sex.

16:01.863 --> 16:05.265
Oh, oh, I am willing
to take that risk.

16:05.267 --> 16:06.750
Good one, Ted.

16:06.752 --> 16:10.086
Anyway, I'm seriously
contemplating purchasing

16:10.088 --> 16:11.204
a new ironing board.

16:11.206 --> 16:13.039
Do you think...?

16:14.408 --> 16:18.962
Okay, I'll give you this: You
stood by your boy all night,

16:18.964 --> 16:21.881
even though you have no chance
of getting with me.

16:21.883 --> 16:23.466
That was pretty cool.

16:23.468 --> 16:26.436
Yeah, you know, in retrospect,
I think that was the moment

16:26.438 --> 16:29.389
you decided to come back
to my place and get nasty.

16:29.391 --> 16:31.424
Yeah, right.

16:31.426 --> 16:33.059
Get up. You're on my bra.

16:33.061 --> 16:34.144
Sorry.

16:36.280 --> 16:37.514
Where's your bathroom?

16:37.516 --> 16:39.366
Past the kitchen, down the hall.

16:43.070 --> 16:45.104
See, I feel like
I would remember

16:45.106 --> 16:47.957
you two being naked on your
couch in the middle of the club.

16:47.959 --> 16:51.944
Oh, right. That was later in my
apartment after we got nasty.

16:51.946 --> 16:52.962
My bad.

16:52.964 --> 16:55.298
So, you want to go
to a diner or something?

16:55.300 --> 16:56.499
Wait-wait-wait.
You slept with her?

16:56.501 --> 16:58.051
I know, I know.

16:58.053 --> 16:59.919
I'm late on sending
the pictures.

16:59.921 --> 17:01.554
I've been swamped.

17:01.556 --> 17:03.006
You like Quinn.
I...

17:03.008 --> 17:05.175
That's why you can't stop
"complaining" about her.

17:05.176 --> 17:08.127
That's why you just tanked
our chance with these...

17:08.128 --> 17:10.180
lovely innocent flowers.

17:10.182 --> 17:11.815
I don't even care
where we go,

17:11.817 --> 17:13.983
but I hate doing it
on the ground.

17:15.102 --> 17:16.269
Barney, do you know why

17:16.271 --> 17:18.354
I'm on the Drunk Train
on Valentine's Day?

17:18.356 --> 17:20.857
Because I have nothing
better to do.

17:20.858 --> 17:23.026
No one I can't stop
thinking about.

17:23.028 --> 17:26.012
So if you feel something
for Quinn, go for it.

17:26.013 --> 17:28.865
Because you're wasting
your time here.

17:28.867 --> 17:31.785
We both are.

17:33.704 --> 17:35.755
I don't like Quinn!

17:38.058 --> 17:39.509
Kevin, I love you,

17:39.511 --> 17:41.377
but please don't
just be the nice guy

17:41.379 --> 17:43.680
who says the right thing.

17:43.682 --> 17:46.182
Robin, I want to marry you
no matter what.

17:46.184 --> 17:48.635
Assuming you don't turn
into a big fat fattie.

17:48.637 --> 17:49.636
See? Right there.

17:49.638 --> 17:51.354
Don't always say
the right thing.

17:51.356 --> 17:52.972
Look, you just got a truckload

17:52.974 --> 17:54.707
of new information
dumped on you.

17:54.709 --> 17:55.892
Will you marry me?

17:55.894 --> 17:57.694
My feelings on kids
aren't gonna change.

17:57.696 --> 17:58.645
Will you marry me?

17:58.647 --> 17:59.863
Haven't you always wanted kids?

17:59.865 --> 18:01.681
That was before I fell in love
with you.

18:01.683 --> 18:03.015
Well, that's the thing.

18:03.017 --> 18:06.069
Your future always
had kids in it.

18:06.071 --> 18:10.290
That is something huge you
would be giving up for me.

18:10.292 --> 18:15.345
I just don't think I could
ever owe someone that much.

18:15.347 --> 18:19.799
I'm scared that you'll...
wake up in-in a year

18:19.801 --> 18:23.753
or ten or 50, full of regret.

18:23.755 --> 18:28.391
So... I need you
to be sure, okay?

18:28.393 --> 18:33.763
If we get married,
you will never have children.

18:33.765 --> 18:36.616
Are you really okay with that?

18:41.772 --> 18:44.390
Enormous Penis Syndrome?

18:44.392 --> 18:45.575
E.P.S.

18:45.577 --> 18:47.026
It's all about awareness.

18:47.028 --> 18:49.863
That's why we're doing
the fun run, the silent auction,

18:49.865 --> 18:50.914
the three-legged race.

18:50.916 --> 18:53.917
Of course, that's just one guy.

18:54.902 --> 18:57.403
You know what?

18:57.405 --> 18:58.671
I can't do this.

18:58.673 --> 19:00.957
You can let me
out up here.

19:00.959 --> 19:02.759
Why? You got a girlfriend
or something?

19:04.962 --> 19:06.629
Maybe something.

19:10.684 --> 19:14.721
<i>Kids, sometimes you realize</i>

19:14.723 --> 19:18.942
the journey you've been taking
<i>has reached its final stop.</i>

19:22.597 --> 19:25.365
<i>Where do you go next?</i>

19:30.070 --> 19:31.571
Hey.

19:33.307 --> 19:34.541
Are you okay?

19:55.563 --> 19:58.481
So... he un-proposed.

19:58.483 --> 20:00.183
♪ Nothing is as it has been...

20:00.185 --> 20:02.569
We're over.

20:02.571 --> 20:06.739
And I-I... I-I know
it's for the best.

20:06.741 --> 20:08.575
It's just...

20:08.577 --> 20:12.862
I was finally ready
for something serious.

20:13.931 --> 20:18.251
He seemed like the guy
to take that next step with.

20:19.236 --> 20:22.639
But he couldn't look past this.

20:23.707 --> 20:25.625
I mean, who could?

20:27.228 --> 20:28.962
I could.

20:30.431 --> 20:33.165
I love you, Robin.

20:44.546 --> 20:46.735
You've been complaining
about this Barney guy so much,

20:46.737 --> 20:47.986
I'm starting to think
that you like him.

20:47.988 --> 20:49.470
Like his apartment-- check.

20:49.472 --> 20:52.807
Like his moves downtown--
check plus.

20:52.809 --> 20:55.193
But like him? Ugh. Please.

20:55.195 --> 20:57.612
I'm just surprised
he doesn't recognize you.

20:57.614 --> 20:59.647
He practically lives here.

20:59.649 --> 21:01.333
Gentlemen, give it up for Karma.
