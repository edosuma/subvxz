-[Mrs. Woods] Blanca dear.
-Oh, hi! Mrs. Woods!

01:27.643 --> 01:31.216
There she is! Ooh! What's this?
It's beautiful!

01:31.284 --> 01:33.955
Oh, these are from
our new Christmas selection.

01:34.022 --> 01:35.693
I've added candy apples
this year.

01:35.759 --> 01:37.730
Ooh! Well, I hope you don't mind
if I sneak one.

01:37.797 --> 01:39.634
[laughs] Mrs. Woods,
they're all for you.

01:39.701 --> 01:41.638
I was just on my way
to come see you.

01:41.705 --> 01:44.444
Oh! Well, thank you.

01:44.510 --> 01:45.646
Of course.

01:45.713 --> 01:48.585
Your father would be so proud.

01:48.652 --> 01:50.622
I remember
when I started working for him

01:50.689 --> 01:52.560
more than 30 years ago,

01:52.626 --> 01:54.764
he had the same energy for it
you do.

01:54.831 --> 01:56.801
He just wanted
to make people happy,

01:56.868 --> 01:58.572
especially around Christmas.

01:58.638 --> 02:00.275
It was his favorite time
of the year.

02:00.342 --> 02:04.650
Made more special after you were
born, his Christmas baby girl.

02:04.717 --> 02:05.819
Well, can I help you
with anything?

02:05.886 --> 02:07.590
Are you picking something up?

02:07.656 --> 02:09.927
Oh, no, no, no,
don't bother yourself.

02:09.994 --> 02:13.200
I can manage. I have Hunter.

02:14.504 --> 02:18.144
Hunter, this is my goddaughter,
Blanca.

02:19.280 --> 02:21.818
-Hi, Blanca.
-Hi.

02:21.885 --> 02:24.857
Hunter is helping with retouches
around the house.

02:24.924 --> 02:28.164
He's actually
a very gifted painter.

with my grandma.

02:35.612 --> 02:38.285
Well, I'm glad you've got
some help.

02:38.351 --> 02:39.654
Well, it was so good to see you.

02:39.721 --> 02:41.725
-Oh...
-Hm...

02:43.060 --> 02:45.766
-Nice to meet you.

03:01.096 --> 03:02.733

[instrumental music]

03:40.742 --> 03:43.247
Christmas again.

03:43.315 --> 03:46.721
I must say, I never really
understood the appeal.

03:48.224 --> 03:50.562
But what you're doing here,
Blanca, is lovely.

03:50.629 --> 03:52.466
I mean, it's just lovely.

03:52.533 --> 03:56.039
It's so Christmassy.

03:56.106 --> 03:58.612
Your father's study sure
could use some sprucing up.

03:58.678 --> 04:02.486
Oh! This is my favorite one.

04:02.553 --> 04:05.926
Dad was always so thoughtful
with little things like this.

04:09.433 --> 04:10.836
Yes, he was thoughtful.

04:10.903 --> 04:13.441
Can you believe
it's been a year?

04:13.508 --> 04:15.779

04:22.860 --> 04:26.166
Oh, Blanca, I'm so clumsy!

04:26.233 --> 04:29.072
I-I've destroyed
your special ornament.

04:29.139 --> 04:33.047
No. It, it's-it's okay,
Victoria.

04:33.113 --> 04:36.988
R-really.
I-it's just an ornament.

04:37.055 --> 04:41.196
I'll have the memories forever.
Please don't feel bad.

04:41.263 --> 04:44.303
Okay. I'll try.

04:53.455 --> 04:55.359
Beautiful!

04:55.425 --> 04:57.262
Darling!

04:57.329 --> 05:00.101
Mwah! Mwah! Ugh. Um...

05:00.167 --> 05:04.242
Ugh, Blanca, I see you're
still cluttering up the place

05:04.310 --> 05:06.681
with decorations, too.

05:06.748 --> 05:09.019
Um, can you just keep this mess

05:09.085 --> 05:11.958
confined to one room, please?

05:12.025 --> 05:13.929
Why? What's going on?

Lucas Prince is what's going on.

-Who's Lucas Prince?
-[gasps]

05:18.838 --> 05:20.943

05:21.009 --> 05:24.817
the most-sought-after
architectural designer

05:24.884 --> 05:28.190
and bachelor this side
of the Mississippi.

05:28.257 --> 05:31.965
And he has graciously agreed
to oversee the renovation

05:32.031 --> 05:34.570
of this beast of a house.

05:34.637 --> 05:37.443
Renovate? What do you mean?

05:37.509 --> 05:39.313
Blanca, take a look around.

05:39.380 --> 05:41.651
I mean, we're living
in a relic from the Dark Ages.

05:41.718 --> 05:44.957
It's time to freshen things up
a bit.

05:45.024 --> 05:46.728
[chuckles] But I grew up
in this house.

05:46.794 --> 05:49.967
And my father renovated it
a few years ago.

05:50.034 --> 05:53.073
Correct, but now I want to make
this house a centerpiece

05:53.140 --> 05:55.946
for the architectural design
community.

05:56.013 --> 05:59.420
I want opulence
pouring out of every room.

05:59.487 --> 06:01.724
-I want it to be--
-Fit for a queen.

06:01.791 --> 06:05.164
Yes. Precisely.

06:05.231 --> 06:08.137
Blanca, darling,
as you yourself said,

06:08.203 --> 06:09.574
I mean, it's just a thing.

06:09.640 --> 06:12.211
A house is just a thing.

06:12.279 --> 06:16.019
And, of course, you'll always
have your memories.

06:16.086 --> 06:19.059
The estate won't be finalized
until my 25th birthday.

06:19.125 --> 06:20.996
That's Christmas Day.

06:21.063 --> 06:23.301
Can't we celebrate
and wait until after that

06:23.368 --> 06:24.370
to discuss this?

06:24.437 --> 06:25.439
Discuss it?

06:25.505 --> 06:28.177
Honey, it's done.

06:28.243 --> 06:29.780
Blanca, there is no reason
to think

06:29.847 --> 06:31.618
that the estate will be held up.

06:31.684 --> 06:35.191
Half the money will go to you,
the other half will come to me.

06:35.257 --> 06:38.163
And the candy company
will be officially in your name.

06:38.230 --> 06:42.273
That was your father's
final birthday gift.

06:42.339 --> 06:45.111

are like sunsets.

06:49.387 --> 06:52.125

you miss them.

06:52.191 --> 06:55.332

-Right off the top of my head.

I have one for you.

-Mm-hmm.

07:05.786 --> 07:08.558

07:08.625 --> 07:09.794
But it's three weeks away.

07:09.860 --> 07:11.263
I know,
but this is the kind of gift

07:11.331 --> 07:14.035
that requires
a little advanced giving.

07:17.676 --> 07:19.045
I don't understand.

07:19.112 --> 07:20.482
I thought it would be fantastic

07:20.549 --> 07:22.653
if you and I spent
your 25th birthday together,

07:22.720 --> 07:26.126
someplace tropical and exotic.

07:26.193 --> 07:29.533
-You and I together?
-Mm-hmm.

07:31.704 --> 07:35.612
Wow! I don't know. I've, I've
never been away for Christmas.

07:35.679 --> 07:39.152
-Yawn.
-[Victoria] I know.

07:39.219 --> 07:42.593
And I thought this Christmas
might be particularly difficult

07:42.659 --> 07:44.129
to be here.

07:44.195 --> 07:45.732
And I think
your father would want you and I

07:45.799 --> 07:49.540
to make some memories together,
don't you, as a family?

07:49.607 --> 07:51.310
That's really thoughtful,
Victoria.

07:51.377 --> 07:54.750
-So you'll go? I mean, we'll go?
-Yes, of course.

07:54.817 --> 07:56.921
-We'll spend Christmas together.
-Yay!

07:56.988 --> 08:00.094
And I'm pretty sure
that's all that matters.

08:00.161 --> 08:03.200
What about the estate meeting
with my dad's lawyer?

08:03.267 --> 08:05.806
Oh, lawyers. Oh, honey, blah.

08:05.872 --> 08:07.810
We'll work something out.

08:07.876 --> 08:10.582
Thank you.
This was so sweet of you.

08:10.649 --> 08:12.085
[Victoria] Oh...

08:13.521 --> 08:14.924
Yay!

08:17.429 --> 08:21.471
Sweet?
You are the most wicked of all.

08:21.537 --> 08:23.073
Thank you.

08:26.681 --> 08:29.420
[Zane] I'm assuming
everything is on track?

08:29.487 --> 08:32.393
[Victoria] Everything
is progressing perfectly.

08:32.459 --> 08:35.532
She's not gonna see a penny
of that money.

08:35.599 --> 08:38.203
A trip to far-off Fiji
is just the thing

08:38.270 --> 08:39.907
to get her out of town
this Christmas

08:39.974 --> 08:41.377
before the deadline.

08:41.444 --> 08:42.880
And, of course,
her poor little bleeding heart

08:42.946 --> 08:46.119
just couldn't say no. [chuckles]

He's here.

Honey, you are...

08:54.068 --> 08:55.806
drop-dead.

08:55.872 --> 08:58.545
Your prince awaits, my lady.

09:27.769 --> 09:29.540
Victoria Snow.

09:29.607 --> 09:33.046
You are just as beautiful
as I imagined.

09:33.113 --> 09:35.352
I mean, your beauty
is simply unmatched,

09:35.418 --> 09:38.358
uh, and a style icon
for the ages.

09:38.424 --> 09:40.629
Mr. Prince, you're too kind.

09:40.695 --> 09:42.131
Lucas... May I call you Lucas?

09:42.198 --> 09:43.535
Well, of course,
I can call you Lucas.

09:43.601 --> 09:46.206
And, of course,
you have met my assistant, Zane.

09:46.274 --> 09:47.910
He's my helper
with all things fabulous.

09:47.976 --> 09:49.179
Fantastic to meet you.

09:49.245 --> 09:51.116
Let's start with the tour,
shall we?

09:51.183 --> 09:53.421
I can't wait
to get my hands dirty.

09:53.488 --> 09:56.661
-[chuckles] Yeah.
-Figuratively, of course.

09:56.727 --> 10:00.535
Stop. Okay, this is the kitchen,
of course, and-and it's open.

10:00.602 --> 10:02.639
But I'd like to open it up
a little bit more.

10:02.706 --> 10:05.345
I'd like to do something,
perhaps, a little Italian or--

10:05.412 --> 10:09.854
When, when what to my wondering
eyes should appear...

10:09.920 --> 10:12.258
-Oh, no.
-But, uh...

10:12.326 --> 10:14.964
This is my, uh, my stepdaughter,
Blanca.

10:15.030 --> 10:17.235
Uh, moving on, moving on...

10:17.302 --> 10:19.874
I don't normally say things
like this,

10:19.940 --> 10:22.846
but you are
the most beautiful woman

10:22.913 --> 10:24.884
I have ever seen.

10:24.950 --> 10:27.956
I'm sure that's not true,
but thank you for saying that.

10:28.023 --> 10:30.261
Lucas Prince.

10:30.328 --> 10:32.599
It is absolutely true.

10:32.666 --> 10:34.436
You are one of a kind.

10:34.503 --> 10:36.641
Yes, like a thrift-store find.

10:37.943 --> 10:40.682
-It's nice to meet you.
-Egh!

10:40.749 --> 10:42.719
[footsteps approaching]

10:42.786 --> 10:44.657
[Hunter] Sorry, I'm late.

10:44.723 --> 10:46.694
Okay, not egh.

10:48.531 --> 10:49.967
-Hi!
-Hi!

10:50.034 --> 10:54.410
-It's great to see you again.
-It's good to see you, too.

10:54.476 --> 10:55.712
I'm Zane.

10:55.779 --> 10:57.716
Everyone, this is Hunter.

10:57.783 --> 10:59.386
He's an extraordinary painter.

10:59.453 --> 11:03.227
I've contracted him to do the
murals you asked for Victoria.

11:03.294 --> 11:05.599
Only the best for my clients.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.736
You two know each other?

11:07.803 --> 11:09.540
Sort of. We--

11:09.607 --> 11:11.510
I-I had
one of your candy apples,

11:11.577 --> 11:14.917
and it was so good
that I had to go by your store

11:14.984 --> 11:16.119
and get a couple more.

11:16.186 --> 11:18.056
Wow. Thank you, really.

11:18.123 --> 11:20.428
Yeah. You really have a gift.

11:20.495 --> 11:21.797
Fascinating.

11:21.864 --> 11:24.436
Lucas, we still have so much
more of the house to see.

11:24.503 --> 11:26.707
-Shall we?
-Yes, of course.

11:26.774 --> 11:28.311
Bye, Hunter.

11:28.378 --> 11:32.051
Blanca, I know this is gonna
seem a bit forward,

11:32.118 --> 11:35.592
but, um, can I take you out
tomorrow night?

11:35.659 --> 11:37.963
Somewhere special.

11:38.030 --> 11:39.800
-Um, I--
-I know.

11:39.867 --> 11:43.308
We've only just met,
but it's Christmas

11:43.374 --> 11:47.549
and the city is beautiful
and sparkling...

11:47.616 --> 11:49.052
just like you.

11:50.422 --> 11:51.991
Say yes.

11:52.058 --> 11:55.832
At least give me a shot
at sweeping you off your feet.

11:55.899 --> 11:58.270
Sure. I'd-I'd love to.

11:59.707 --> 12:02.679
You have just made me
the luckiest man in the city.

12:02.746 --> 12:05.017
[Victoria] Lucas,
we are waiting.

12:05.084 --> 12:08.758
I'll pick you up tomorrow night
at 7:00. Wear your best dress.

12:09.893 --> 12:11.597
I'll see you then.

12:14.870 --> 12:16.374
Sorry about that.

12:16.440 --> 12:19.947
What? Oh, that? Ah...

12:20.014 --> 12:23.120
I'm sure
he's full of grand gestures.

12:23.186 --> 12:27.929
Well, um, don't worry about it.
I'm just here to do the mural.

12:27.996 --> 12:30.969
But it is really great
to see you again, Blanca.

12:31.036 --> 12:32.472
You, too.

12:32.539 --> 12:35.412
Maybe I could, uh, paint
something just for you.

12:35.478 --> 12:39.286
-Mm! I'd like that.
-Yeah?

12:39.353 --> 12:42.058
So, um, what do you think
for the mural?

12:42.124 --> 12:44.596
Uh, Victoria's face or Zane's?

12:44.663 --> 12:46.500
You could just
mix them together.

12:46.567 --> 12:49.205
I mean, they're together
all the time, so both.

12:49.273 --> 12:50.809
-Perfect.
-Yeah.

12:52.044 --> 12:55.184
[instrumental music]

12:57.121 --> 12:58.691
[doorbell rings]

12:58.758 --> 13:02.332
-[Zane] Victoria?
-I'm in here.

13:02.399 --> 13:05.705
-A present arrived for you.
-Oh! Oh!

13:05.772 --> 13:06.874
Oh, my!

13:06.941 --> 13:09.346
Hiring Lucas Prince
to renovate your house

13:09.413 --> 13:12.386
is just the beginning
of your fairy-tale romance.

13:12.452 --> 13:13.554
I knew he was into you.

13:13.621 --> 13:16.827
Go ahead, read the card.
Thrill me.

13:19.733 --> 13:20.869
Ooh!

13:22.673 --> 13:24.376
[clears throat]

13:24.443 --> 13:27.949
"White roses for you,
the most beautiful of all,

13:28.016 --> 13:32.325
more magical and enchanting
than a Christmas snowfall.

13:32.392 --> 13:35.699
I'm honored that you'll be
my date tonight...

13:37.536 --> 13:39.005
Blanca."

13:39.072 --> 13:40.709
-[Victoria coughing]
-Oh, no, sweet... Oh, no, no.

13:40.775 --> 13:42.244
No, God, no...
Sweetheart, please don't...

13:42.312 --> 13:44.750
Come on, breathe. [inhales]

13:44.817 --> 13:46.854
Ah...

13:46.921 --> 13:49.225
Breathe. Breathe.

13:50.995 --> 13:53.568
-Open--
-Blanca?

13:53.634 --> 13:55.003
I know, I know,
but, sweetheart, you,

13:55.070 --> 13:57.509
you need to keep your eye
on the prize, okay?

13:57.576 --> 13:59.947
You need to focus on what is
really important right now,

14:00.013 --> 14:01.917
and that is getting
what you want at any cost.

14:01.984 --> 14:04.757
I hate her so much!

14:04.823 --> 14:06.527
I know, I know you do.

14:06.594 --> 14:08.331
-But you're right.
-I know, I know--

14:08.398 --> 14:10.502
-You're right.
-Shh, shh.

14:10.568 --> 14:13.708
I cannot afford to let myself
become distracted now.

14:13.775 --> 14:15.043
I know.

14:15.110 --> 14:17.214
I mean, and besides, this can't
exactly be a surprise.

14:17.282 --> 14:20.422
She is, like, you know, the most
beautiful thing that ever lived.

14:20.488 --> 14:22.793
What I wouldn't give
for her cheekbones. And--

14:22.859 --> 14:24.496
Get out, get out, get out,
get out, get out!

14:24.563 --> 14:27.268
[instrumental music]

14:28.036 --> 14:29.038
You like them?

14:29.105 --> 14:30.107
They're just like the flowers

14:30.174 --> 14:31.744
that I sent you before.

14:38.691 --> 14:42.031
I will never understand
what he sees in her.

14:42.098 --> 14:43.668
Huh...

14:46.039 --> 14:47.375
Ugh!

14:52.184 --> 14:53.588
Tell me a story.

14:53.654 --> 14:57.762
Once upon a time
there was a dim-witted lawyer

14:57.829 --> 15:00.702
who received a heartfelt letter
from Blanca,

15:00.768 --> 15:04.877
the sweet daughter of a man
who had recently passed away.

15:04.943 --> 15:06.347
I love this story.

15:06.413 --> 15:09.486
In this letter,
Blanca signed away

15:09.553 --> 15:11.457
her half of his fortune

15:11.524 --> 15:16.032
to her beloved stepmother,
the widow.

15:16.099 --> 15:18.236
Aw... Was the letter notarized?

15:18.304 --> 15:19.873
Yes.

15:19.940 --> 15:22.178
And by the way, notary school
is an absolute bore.

15:22.244 --> 15:23.381
You're welcome.

15:23.447 --> 15:25.819
But you see,
that's all it takes.

15:25.885 --> 15:28.591
She has until 8 p. m.,
December 25th,

15:28.658 --> 15:31.497
her 25th birthday,
to change her mind.

15:31.564 --> 15:35.505
And then everything is mine,
including Lucas.

15:44.857 --> 15:47.161
You know, it isn't something
I would normally do,

15:47.228 --> 15:50.502
but I really enjoyed the ballet.

15:50.568 --> 15:53.875
It was beautiful. Thank you.

15:53.941 --> 15:55.512
You're welcome.

15:55.578 --> 15:57.949
I, uh, I actually go
all the time.

15:58.016 --> 16:00.922
My family's had that private box
for over 40 years.

16:00.989 --> 16:04.296
So we've made it
one of our Christmas traditions.

16:04.363 --> 16:06.534
-That's so nice.
-Yeah.

16:06.600 --> 16:09.238
My family and I have
a few traditions, too.

16:09.306 --> 16:10.775
My dad and I used to decorate

16:10.842 --> 16:14.115
and make all different kinds
of hot chocolate

16:14.182 --> 16:17.121
and he would tell me stories
about my mom.

16:17.188 --> 16:20.361
She died when I was born,
but his stories of her

16:20.428 --> 16:23.534
were such a big part
of every Christmas time.

16:23.601 --> 16:25.103
I didn't realize.

16:25.170 --> 16:27.141
Oh. No, i-it's okay.

16:27.208 --> 16:31.650
Those memories actually inspired
my idea for the new candy shop.

16:31.717 --> 16:34.289
A hot-chocolate bar.

16:34.356 --> 16:37.127
-Hm.
-You don't like it?

16:37.194 --> 16:42.137
Oh, I just, I wonder
if people will really go for it.

16:42.204 --> 16:43.774
I think they will.

16:43.841 --> 16:47.482
I think sometimes the simplest
things in life are the best,

16:47.549 --> 16:49.519
especially around Christmas.

16:49.586 --> 16:51.757
It's the magic of the season.

17:09.893 --> 17:11.931
You know,
I was actually named Blanca

17:11.997 --> 17:14.770
because it snowed
the day I was born.

17:14.836 --> 17:17.275
Well, then I'm glad it snowed.

17:17.342 --> 17:20.080
Lucas, tonight was just--

I know. It's just what happens
when we're together.

17:24.623 --> 17:29.533

such a beautiful match for me.

17:29.600 --> 17:33.808

17:33.874 --> 17:36.480
Can we make it two in a row

17:36.547 --> 17:39.251
You certainly are fearless.

17:39.319 --> 17:41.055
I just know what I want.

17:43.561 --> 17:45.898
I promise something simpler.

17:45.965 --> 17:49.473
I just have so much to do
at the store before I leave.

17:49.539 --> 17:52.011
I wish I was staying in town
for Christmas.

17:52.077 --> 17:54.115
[Lucas] What? Where are you
going?

17:54.181 --> 17:58.291
I, I thought we could spend
the holiday season together,

17:58.357 --> 18:00.528
really celebrate in style.

18:00.595 --> 18:02.799
I'm not done romancing you.

18:02.866 --> 18:05.872
We've only just begun,
dear Blanca.

18:05.938 --> 18:10.213
I know. I-I wish I could spend
Christmas at home and with you.

18:10.281 --> 18:14.121
I... It was just
such a sweet gift from Victoria.

18:14.188 --> 18:17.996
I try to hang on to any gesture
that I can get from her.

18:19.900 --> 18:22.505
Let me see if I can work some
magic on Victoria.

18:22.572 --> 18:25.077
I'll assure her that I'll keep
the house renovations on track

18:25.143 --> 18:28.517
and, and you'll be
taken care of.

18:28.584 --> 18:30.555
You would do that for me?

18:30.621 --> 18:32.792
Of course.

18:32.859 --> 18:35.598
I would do anything
to see you again.

18:35.665 --> 18:39.773
Well, in that case,
I would love to stay.

and it worked!

20:56.112 --> 20:58.082
Uh, so this woman, for a price,

20:58.149 --> 21:00.855
can be very effective,
very permanent.

21:02.392 --> 21:05.230
For even more money,
she can be very discreet.

21:50.288 --> 21:53.059
I thought
why not throw you a party.

21:53.126 --> 21:55.765
Ms. Raven is the party planner
extraordinaire.

21:55.831 --> 21:58.169
She is the best of the best. Hm.

You didn't have to go through

22:01.008 --> 22:02.946
-Snooze.
-Nonsense.

22:03.012 --> 22:05.785
Sweetheart,
it's your special day.

22:05.851 --> 22:08.824
Zane, could you please
go check on anything?

22:24.589 --> 22:27.729
When I plan parties,

22:27.795 --> 22:29.332

you should be surrounded

by things you love
and make you happy.

-[bell chimes]
-Four.

23:03.266 --> 23:06.105
We stayed
in a cute, little hotel.

-A simple motel. Three.

23:14.823 --> 23:17.295
We always made hot chocolate.

23:17.362 --> 23:20.968

couldn't afford anything else.

-Two.

23:27.014 --> 23:30.488

23:33.159 --> 23:35.531

remember are the simple things

23:38.304 --> 23:41.443
you loved to do
with your father.

23:41.510 --> 23:44.916
You'll want to live in this town
you wake up in.

23:44.983 --> 23:48.524
You will not remember
your inheritance.

23:48.590 --> 23:52.532
You will be content
in your new world.

23:52.598 --> 23:54.936
[bell chiming]

23:56.373 --> 23:57.976

24:01.550 --> 24:03.320
Oh. Oh, I know. Yeah.

24:03.387 --> 24:05.591
No, they were supposed
to cheer someone up.

24:05.658 --> 24:09.098
You will forget everyone
but your late father.

24:09.164 --> 24:13.106
You will forget his money
and business,

24:13.172 --> 24:16.947
remembering only
the simple memories of him.

24:17.014 --> 24:19.686
Counting back,
when I get to one,

24:19.753 --> 24:22.325
the spell will begin. Three...

24:22.392 --> 24:25.263
Turns out she doesn't need
cheering up anymore, no.

24:25.331 --> 24:28.837
You will have no memories
of this session. Two...

24:28.904 --> 24:31.576
Oh, yeah, well, she met, like,
the man of the century. Mm-hmm.

24:31.643 --> 24:34.516
Yeah, seems he just snapped her
right out of her funk.

24:34.582 --> 24:37.388
None of this
ever to be remembered again.

24:37.455 --> 24:39.993
Well, true love
breaks all spells.

24:40.060 --> 24:41.530
[Raven] One!

24:42.999 --> 24:45.003
What just happened?

24:46.205 --> 24:47.742
Well, it can't be that bad.

24:47.809 --> 24:50.915
Well, the spell's been cast, but
now there's a stipulation.

24:50.981 --> 24:52.985
True love will bring back
all her memories,

24:53.052 --> 24:55.725
returning her to exactly
who she was ten minutes ago.

24:55.791 --> 24:57.695
Oh, no, no, no, no! No! No, no!

24:57.762 --> 25:00.801
She can't come back here,
at least until after Christmas.

25:00.868 --> 25:02.305
She has to stay away that long.

25:02.371 --> 25:04.776
And she certainly
can't fall in love.

25:04.843 --> 25:07.382
Remind me again
why I keep you around?

25:07.448 --> 25:09.118
Bad time to tell you
that the tickets to Fiji

25:09.184 --> 25:11.055
are non-refundable.

25:11.122 --> 25:14.061
Raven, this is where
you earn your keep.

25:14.128 --> 25:16.833
If you want your big payday,
you need to tell us

25:16.900 --> 25:19.873
how to salvage this situation.

25:19.939 --> 25:21.510
There is nothing to salvage.

25:21.576 --> 25:23.514
The spell has been cast.

25:23.580 --> 25:25.551
Bring her to the Spessart Motor
Lodge.

25:25.618 --> 25:29.359
Ring the chime three times
and make yourself scarce.

25:29.426 --> 25:31.630
When she wakes up, she'll
believe she belongs there,

25:31.696 --> 25:33.600
remembering nothing

25:33.667 --> 25:36.172
but her father
and her Christmas memories.

25:36.238 --> 25:38.444
As long as true love
does not cross her path,

25:38.510 --> 25:40.347
the deal is done.

25:43.520 --> 25:44.656
Well...

25:46.827 --> 25:48.997
here goes nothing.

25:49.933 --> 25:53.072
[instrumental music]

26:13.714 --> 26:14.682
Oh.

26:14.749 --> 26:17.455
[bell chiming]

26:35.958 --> 26:39.097
[instrumental music]

27:02.745 --> 27:04.349
[bell rings]

27:08.222 --> 27:11.863
Hi. I was just...
There was nobody at the front.

27:11.930 --> 27:13.634
I'm sorry. I'm Hap.

27:13.700 --> 27:14.936
Hi, I'm Blanca.

27:15.003 --> 27:16.238
This is my family's place,

27:16.306 --> 27:18.009
and my cousin
who normally runs it

27:18.075 --> 27:20.481
goes on vacation
every year I come here.

27:20.548 --> 27:22.718
-So you're staying here?
-Yes, indeed.

27:22.785 --> 27:25.858
I'm with a traveling band.
We come here every Christmas.

27:25.925 --> 27:27.962
We're called The Holly Jollies.

27:28.029 --> 27:30.568
We specialize
in Christmas cheer.

27:30.634 --> 27:34.074
We have a residency at
the Diamond Grill here in town.

27:34.141 --> 27:37.247
It's all Christmas music
all night long.

27:37.315 --> 27:38.917
-What a fun job.
-Yes, indeed.

27:38.984 --> 27:42.157
Now, your room has been paid
for in full for the next month

27:42.224 --> 27:44.762
by your friend
that dropped you off.

27:44.829 --> 27:47.935
You must be tired
from your ride, I can imagine.

27:48.002 --> 27:49.204
Why don't you get some rest?

27:49.271 --> 27:50.240
I'll be by in the morning

27:50.307 --> 27:52.678
with my favorite coffee

27:52.745 --> 27:55.016
and I'll answer any questions
you have about town.

27:55.083 --> 27:57.187
That actually sounds perfect.

27:57.254 --> 27:59.024
Great.
I'll see you in the morning.

27:59.091 --> 28:00.327
Okay.

28:01.730 --> 28:04.969
Hap, you were right.
This coffee is delicious.

28:05.036 --> 28:06.273
I've never tried
a Christmas brew,

28:06.339 --> 28:09.111
but you're right, it's amazing.

28:09.177 --> 28:10.481
Well, I'm glad you showed up

28:10.547 --> 28:14.187
or I would have had to finish it
all myself.

28:14.254 --> 28:15.758
I'm also glad
I gave it a green light

28:15.824 --> 28:20.467
to bring your Christmas magic
to this place. Yeah.

28:20.534 --> 28:24.207
Blanca, um, what's your story?

28:25.109 --> 28:27.949
It's all kind of a blur, really.

28:28.015 --> 28:29.752
-I think I just needed the rest.
-Hm.

28:29.819 --> 28:32.291
I mean, the holidays are
my favorite time of the year,

28:32.358 --> 28:35.664
but it's my first Christmas
without my dad.

28:35.731 --> 28:37.267
-Hm.
-I guess...

28:37.335 --> 28:40.006
You could say I'm a bit lost.

28:40.073 --> 28:42.445
But why Spessart?

28:43.280 --> 28:45.016
I don't really know.

28:45.083 --> 28:46.820
But my father always said,

28:46.886 --> 28:48.624
"Follow your heart's direction.

28:48.690 --> 28:50.461
It's the best driver
you've got."

28:50.527 --> 28:54.267
That's a perfect perspective
and great advice.

28:54.335 --> 28:56.271
-[knocking on door]
-[Doc] Hap?

28:56.339 --> 28:57.775
Yeah, come on in.

28:59.044 --> 29:00.381
It's time for rehearsal.

29:00.447 --> 29:02.183
[Hap] Yeah. Yeah, Jeez.

29:02.250 --> 29:04.789
-Oh, hello there.
-I lost track of time.

29:04.856 --> 29:09.064
But, Blanca, this is Doc,
our manager extraordinaire.

29:09.131 --> 29:10.534
It's short for Dakota.

29:10.601 --> 29:12.405
It's nice to meet you, Blanca,
and welcome.

29:12.471 --> 29:14.709
Thank you.
It's nice to meet you, too, Doc.

29:14.776 --> 29:16.479
-I'm really happy to be here.
-[Doc] Well...

29:16.546 --> 29:19.385
This place has seen better days,
but we feel like

29:19.452 --> 29:21.790
it's our home away from home
this time of year.

29:21.856 --> 29:23.827
And by the looks of it,
you're gonna make this place

29:23.894 --> 29:25.029
sing Christmas for us.

29:25.096 --> 29:26.733
-[Hap] Mm, mm.
-That's the plan.

29:26.800 --> 29:30.975
But speaking of singing
Christmas, we've gotta run.

29:31.041 --> 29:33.547
We've got a new set to run
through and the band is waiting.

29:33.613 --> 29:36.987
I got you, Doc.
She's the boss.

29:37.053 --> 29:39.325
Blanca, I hope you can come
see our show tomorrow night.

29:39.392 --> 29:40.561
[Blanca] Oh, I wouldn't miss it.

29:40.627 --> 29:42.732
Great. We will see you then.

29:42.798 --> 29:45.404
Hey, we needed someone
to come around here

29:45.471 --> 29:47.308
and make this place
feel like home.

29:47.375 --> 29:50.246
I think I needed a place
to call home.

29:56.459 --> 29:59.599
[instrumental music]

30:16.866 --> 30:18.670
[breathing heavily]
Thirty eight.

30:18.737 --> 30:20.441
Twelve.

30:22.177 --> 30:23.880
Thirty nine.

30:24.982 --> 30:27.388
Thirteen.

30:28.623 --> 30:31.161
-F-forty.
-[cell phone beeps]

30:31.228 --> 30:33.567
Oh. O-M-G.

30:33.633 --> 30:35.871
I put an alert on Blanca
and she just came up.

30:35.938 --> 30:40.012
She's hash-tagging herself.
Pathetic.

30:40.079 --> 30:42.585
-Blanca's crafting.
-Gag.

30:42.651 --> 30:44.187
[cell phone message alert]

30:46.125 --> 30:47.361
Oh.

30:47.428 --> 30:49.832
-[Zane] Who's that?
-Lucas.

30:49.899 --> 30:52.237
Looks like he won't be able
to make it tomorrow.

30:53.540 --> 30:55.844
He's not tracking her, is he?

30:55.911 --> 30:58.717
No. No. Definitely not.

31:00.219 --> 31:03.560
Probably not. No?

31:03.627 --> 31:06.533
You better hope not.
Hold my feet.

31:06.599 --> 31:09.237
Not with your scrawny arms.
Sit on them.

31:11.376 --> 31:12.445
Seventy five.

31:12.511 --> 31:13.814
-Fifteen.
-[Victoria grunts]

31:13.880 --> 31:15.049
[Lucas] Blanca?

31:15.116 --> 31:16.753
[knocking on door]

31:16.820 --> 31:19.792
[Lucas] Blanca? Sweetheart?
Are you here?

31:25.571 --> 31:28.510
-Can I help you?
-I knew I would find you.

31:28.577 --> 31:30.314
Why did you leave?
Were you taken?

31:30.380 --> 31:33.018
-Excuse me?
-[Lucas] Who's there?

31:33.085 --> 31:35.424
-Come out wherever you are!
-Who are you talking to?

31:35.491 --> 31:37.060
Is the monster who took you
here?

31:37.127 --> 31:38.396
Um...

31:38.463 --> 31:40.901
Oh, my God.

31:40.968 --> 31:43.038
-This place looks like prison.
-Who are you?

31:43.105 --> 31:44.609
You can't just barge in here.

31:44.675 --> 31:47.247
You just left
in the middle of the night.

31:47.314 --> 31:50.019
But then I saw your post
and I knew,

31:50.086 --> 31:51.422
I knew it was your signal to me.

31:51.489 --> 31:52.958
Okay, you need to leave.

31:53.025 --> 31:54.996
But I, I came to rescue you.

31:55.062 --> 31:56.800
I have no idea who you are

31:56.866 --> 31:58.970
and I certainly
don't need rescuing.

31:59.037 --> 32:00.808
Maybe you've hit your head.
Sweetheart--

32:00.874 --> 32:01.843
Don't call me that.

32:01.910 --> 32:03.380
I didn't hit my head.

32:03.446 --> 32:05.584
Well, something has happened
to you.

32:06.719 --> 32:09.492
-Do you remember Victoria?
-Who?

32:09.559 --> 32:12.331
-Zane?
-W-what's that?

32:12.398 --> 32:13.500
Your father?

32:13.567 --> 32:15.571
Of course, I remember my father.

32:15.637 --> 32:17.675
Most importantly,

32:17.741 --> 32:22.150
do you remember the name
Lucas Prince?

32:22.217 --> 32:24.655
No. I don't know that name.

32:26.426 --> 32:29.432
I am Lucas Prince.

32:29.499 --> 32:32.705
You and I are in love.

32:32.771 --> 32:35.878
Does most eligible bachelor
in Architectural Digest

32:35.944 --> 32:37.414
ring any bells?

32:39.652 --> 32:41.656
[scoffs] Maybe the stress
of the season?

32:41.723 --> 32:43.860
Something has caused you
to lose your memory.

32:43.927 --> 32:47.701
Okay, if you know me, tell me
something you know about me.

32:49.505 --> 32:50.541
That's what I thought.

32:50.607 --> 32:52.645
Wait, um, no.

32:52.711 --> 32:54.515
The stories your father told

32:54.582 --> 32:55.884
about your mother
every Christmas.

32:55.951 --> 32:57.855
It was a white Christmas
the day you were born

32:57.922 --> 33:00.427
and that's why
you're called Blanca.

33:00.494 --> 33:01.930
How do you know that?

33:01.996 --> 33:03.567
Because you,

33:03.633 --> 33:06.004
beautiful Blanca, you told me.

33:06.071 --> 33:08.075
Wait, what you're saying
doesn't make sense.

33:08.142 --> 33:11.014
-Why don't I remember you?
-I don't know.

33:11.081 --> 33:14.689
But we can find out together.
Let's go home.

33:14.755 --> 33:17.728
No! I am home
and I don't know you!

33:18.964 --> 33:21.669
What do you remember
about yesterday

33:21.736 --> 33:24.542
before you arrived here?

33:27.146 --> 33:30.186
I, I don't, I don't know.

33:30.253 --> 33:32.658
See? Something is wrong.

33:32.725 --> 33:35.162
Please let me help you.

33:35.229 --> 33:37.601
Just talk to me.

33:37.668 --> 33:41.776
Okay. Um, I'll meet you
for coffee tomorrow.

33:41.843 --> 33:44.080
Okay.

33:44.147 --> 33:48.022
At least let me put you up
in some more suitable lodging.

33:48.088 --> 33:50.394
I like it here.

33:50.460 --> 33:51.496
Okay. This is worse
than I thought.

33:51.562 --> 33:53.232
Okay. Okay.

33:53.300 --> 33:56.138
I'll go, but I won't go far.

33:56.204 --> 33:58.610
I'll book a space that I saw
on my way in.

33:58.677 --> 34:01.683
More five-star,
if you know what I mean.

34:03.185 --> 34:05.189
Do you know, my love?

34:05.256 --> 34:07.026
Please, just call me Blanca.

34:07.093 --> 34:12.070
Okay. Um, until tomorrow,
my... Blanca.

34:14.508 --> 34:16.211
[door shuts]

34:16.279 --> 34:19.418
[instrumental music]

34:32.645 --> 34:34.180
[cell phone message alert]

34:36.251 --> 34:38.088
Whoa!

34:38.155 --> 34:40.694
-Oh, no!
-Oh, yes.

34:40.761 --> 34:42.831
-But she won't remember him.
-Well, of course, she won't.

34:42.898 --> 34:45.704
But you've witnessed his charm.
He's irresistible.

34:45.771 --> 34:46.873
It's only a matter of time

34:46.939 --> 34:48.977
before he woos her
all over again.

34:49.044 --> 34:50.847
Oh, his wooing.

34:50.914 --> 34:53.787
We've got to send someone else
up to keep an eye on her,

34:53.853 --> 34:57.995
to distract her, to prevent her
from falling in love with Lucas

34:58.062 --> 34:59.498
all over again.

34:59.565 --> 35:02.003
It would be good if there was
somebody already on the payroll.

35:02.070 --> 35:03.238
Hm.

35:08.516 --> 35:09.919
Hunter?

35:14.260 --> 35:15.564
Hunter?

35:19.572 --> 35:21.074
Hunter!

35:22.845 --> 35:24.715
Yeah?

35:24.782 --> 35:27.053
Darling, it seems
our dear Blanca's gotten herself

35:27.120 --> 35:28.823
into a bit of trouble.

35:28.890 --> 35:30.192
-What kind of trouble?
-Well, apparently...

35:30.259 --> 35:33.232
She's got a sort of
stress-induced amnesia.

35:33.299 --> 35:35.804
Now, Lucas has gone
to bring her home,

35:35.871 --> 35:38.276
but it was his insisting that
she stay home for Christmas,

35:38.343 --> 35:40.647
in the first place,
that brought this amnesia on.

35:40.714 --> 35:42.284
-Amnesia?
-I know.

35:42.351 --> 35:45.424
Well, we're simply worried that
any attempt to bring her home

35:45.490 --> 35:47.761
might make it permanent.

35:47.828 --> 35:52.638
Now, Lucas is a dear
and he means well,

35:52.705 --> 35:55.677
but he really
has to be reigned in.

35:55.744 --> 35:58.248
Yes. What do you need me to do?

35:59.150 --> 36:01.789
Love this so much.

36:02.658 --> 36:05.196
[instrumental music]

36:12.544 --> 36:14.315
[audience applauding]

36:14.382 --> 36:17.120
Hey, everyone.
Thanks for coming out tonight.

36:17.186 --> 36:20.927
That one was dedicated
to our new friend, Blanca.

36:20.994 --> 36:23.700
We'll be back for round two
of your Christmas favorites.

36:23.767 --> 36:26.305
We are The Holly Jollies.
Stick around.

36:26.372 --> 36:28.543
[audience applauding]

36:29.912 --> 36:32.451
-You guys are so good!
-[Hap] You made it!

36:32.518 --> 36:34.220
I'm so glad you're here!

36:34.288 --> 36:35.891
Let me introduce you
to the group.

36:35.957 --> 36:37.895
Hey, everybody, this is Blanca.

36:37.961 --> 36:40.300
Blanca,
these are The Holly Jollies.

36:40.367 --> 36:43.706
-Hello.
-That's Zee.

36:43.773 --> 36:46.312
Once I saw her fall asleep
in the middle of a song

36:46.379 --> 36:48.650
and wake up on beat. Amazing.

36:48.716 --> 36:50.420
-[sneezes]
-Bless you.

36:50.487 --> 36:53.760
Uh, yeah. Uh, that's true.

36:53.827 --> 36:56.766
He's not contagious,
he's just allergic to, uh,

36:56.833 --> 36:58.035
pine trees and poinsettias.

36:58.102 --> 36:59.738
I don't know.
And this is Natalie.

36:59.805 --> 37:01.007
-Also known as Nat.
-Hello.

37:01.074 --> 37:02.544
She's our resident
tambourine player.

37:02.611 --> 37:06.786
And this is Oscar.
Pay him no mind.

37:06.853 --> 37:09.892
That's Tim,
our sound guy and bass player.

37:09.959 --> 37:11.261
-And this is the crew.
-Well...

37:11.329 --> 37:12.564
It's so good to meet all of you.

37:12.631 --> 37:14.301
You guys are seriously so good.

37:14.368 --> 37:15.770
The crowd loves you.

37:15.837 --> 37:17.574
They've been good to us
throughout the years.

37:17.641 --> 37:21.749
But we need to go with Doc
and look over our playlist.

37:21.816 --> 37:24.755
And I don't think
you'll be alone too long.

37:27.059 --> 37:29.365
-Wait, don't go.
-You'll be fine.

37:33.138 --> 37:34.375
-Hi.
-Hi.

37:37.079 --> 37:39.718
Do we, uh, know each other?

37:39.785 --> 37:41.956
Not that I know of.

37:42.023 --> 37:45.764
-Is anyone sitting here?
-It's all yours.

37:45.831 --> 37:48.503
One Christmas Irish coffee,
right?

37:48.570 --> 37:50.974
Yes. Thank you.

37:52.109 --> 37:53.746
I'm Hunter.

37:53.813 --> 37:55.550
Hi, I'm Blanca.

37:55.617 --> 37:57.654
Nice to meet you, Blanca.

37:57.721 --> 38:00.460
So do you, uh, come here often

38:00.527 --> 38:04.067
to watch The Holly Jollies?

38:04.133 --> 38:06.839
-They're really good.
-Yeah, they are.

38:06.906 --> 38:08.843
Um, no, this is actually
my first time.

38:08.910 --> 38:11.081
I just moved here, like,
yesterday

38:11.147 --> 38:14.655
and that's when I met Hap,
the lead singer.

38:14.722 --> 38:17.628
And you remember that
from yesterday?

38:17.694 --> 38:20.099
Yes, all the way from yesterday.

38:20.165 --> 38:22.103
Huh. Right.

38:22.905 --> 38:25.310
That's cool.

38:25.377 --> 38:27.614
So where did you move from?

38:27.681 --> 38:30.219
Um, from out of town.

38:30.287 --> 38:32.658
-Hm.
-How long have you lived here?

38:32.724 --> 38:34.361
Actually, I'm just here
for the holiday.

38:34.428 --> 38:37.233
-Oh, do you have family here?
-Nope.

38:37.301 --> 38:40.340
No family to spend it with
at home?

38:40.407 --> 38:42.009
No, not really.

38:42.076 --> 38:45.517
So I thought I'd do something
a little different this year.

38:45.584 --> 38:46.886
What about you?

38:46.953 --> 38:49.925
Tsk. No family
to spend it with anymore.

38:51.996 --> 38:53.900
Oh, they're going back on.

38:57.374 --> 38:58.743
Cheers.

39:01.816 --> 39:04.120
-This has been really fun.
-Yeah, it has.

39:04.187 --> 39:06.592
It's getting late.
I should probably get going.

39:06.659 --> 39:10.567
Okay. Hey, can I see you again?

39:10.634 --> 39:13.406
-Yeah. For sure.
-Okay.

39:13.473 --> 39:16.144
How about, uh, coffee tomorrow?

39:16.211 --> 39:20.320
Um, I'm busy during the day.
But how is tomorrow evening?

39:20.387 --> 39:23.760
-Did you just ask me to dinner?
-Maybe.

39:23.826 --> 39:26.832
Wow. My answer is yes.

39:26.899 --> 39:29.137
-I could pick you up at 7:00?
-Perfect.

39:29.203 --> 39:31.241
-Okay.
-Okay. I'll see you then.

39:31.309 --> 39:32.444
Yeah.

39:35.450 --> 39:36.786
Hm.

39:50.714 --> 39:54.421
[Lucas] Your signature
white rose.

39:54.488 --> 39:56.091
What, what do you mean?

39:56.157 --> 39:59.498
White roses are so us.

39:59.565 --> 40:02.604
I-I'm sorry. What?

40:02.671 --> 40:04.341
That's okay. Really, it's fine.

40:04.408 --> 40:06.946
Um, we can start over.

40:07.013 --> 40:09.485
It'll be our own
classic Love Story Part Two.

40:09.551 --> 40:13.626
[chuckles] So, uh,
tell me how I know you?

40:13.693 --> 40:15.195
Uh, Victoria hired me to--

40:15.262 --> 40:18.035
I'm sorry, I-I don't know
who Victoria is.

40:18.101 --> 40:21.309
Could you, could you tell me
something about you?

40:23.513 --> 40:24.748
Well, let's see.

40:24.815 --> 40:27.487
Uh, I'm a very successful
architect.

40:27.554 --> 40:29.925
I've been featured in a number
of national magazines.

40:29.992 --> 40:32.029
I'm also quite well known for,
uh,

40:32.096 --> 40:35.002
being a very eligible bachelor

40:35.069 --> 40:38.710
until I met
my perfect, beautiful match...

40:38.776 --> 40:40.513
you.

40:40.580 --> 40:42.651
Okay, you know, I'm, I'm gonna
go with this

40:42.718 --> 40:46.191
because you seem to know things
about me that I can't remember.

40:46.257 --> 40:52.637
Um, so far I hear that you're a,
a big deal, and a ladies' man,

40:52.704 --> 40:55.577
and... apparently, dating me?

40:55.643 --> 40:57.581
If-if I'm gonna believe all of
this, I need you

40:57.647 --> 41:02.324
to at least tell me something
about you, as a person.

41:03.493 --> 41:05.830
As a person?

41:05.897 --> 41:07.901
I mean, I-I would like to think
I was attracted

41:07.968 --> 41:10.540
to more than
what you just described.

41:10.607 --> 41:13.713
Well, uh, we enjoyed the good
life together.

41:13.780 --> 41:16.017
I love the ballet and I took you

41:16.084 --> 41:17.921
and you thought
it was beautiful.

41:17.988 --> 41:20.025
-The ballet?
-Yes.

41:20.092 --> 41:22.029
For fun? I mean...

41:22.096 --> 41:24.000
I mean, that-that doesn't really
sound like something

41:24.067 --> 41:26.906
I would be into.
You know, I'm gonna go, I--

41:26.972 --> 41:28.276
No! Wait, wait, wait, wait.

41:28.342 --> 41:30.780
Uh, our favorite time together

41:30.847 --> 41:32.551
was when I rented out a cafe

41:32.617 --> 41:36.024
and you made all different kinds
of hot chocolate,

41:36.091 --> 41:38.228
just like you and your father
would do.

41:39.898 --> 41:42.203
You, you did that for me?

41:45.377 --> 41:49.752
As I've always said,
nothing is too grand for you.

41:49.818 --> 41:52.724
So w-what
was your favorite kind?

41:52.791 --> 41:53.960
-My favorite?
-Mm-hmm.

41:54.026 --> 41:58.101
Uh... it was very clever.

41:58.168 --> 42:00.272
White-chocolate Christmas.

42:03.679 --> 42:05.617
That was my dad's favorite.

42:06.485 --> 42:08.289
Yes, it was.

42:08.356 --> 42:10.960
You see, we're connected.

42:11.027 --> 42:12.464
Please, let me take you
to dinner,

42:12.531 --> 42:14.802
the finest
this town has to offer.

42:14.868 --> 42:17.374
And we can figure it out.

42:17.441 --> 42:19.645
I can help you.

42:19.711 --> 42:21.147
I-I can't do dinner tonight,

42:21.214 --> 42:24.187
but, um, but I'll meet you here
again tomorrow.

42:24.253 --> 42:27.327
I just... I need time to really
make sense of all of this.

42:27.394 --> 42:29.465
-Of course, of course.
-And I'm, I'm gonna just...

42:29.531 --> 42:32.304
I will meet you anywhere,
anytime.

42:32.370 --> 42:34.207
I have to make
some work calls tonight.

42:34.274 --> 42:36.946
But I'm at the Diamond Cliffs
Resort if you need anything.

42:37.012 --> 42:39.918
Thank you. Thank you.

42:48.870 --> 42:51.976
Victoria, I have found her.

42:52.042 --> 42:54.213
What do you mean, you found her?

42:56.719 --> 42:58.021
Well, it sounds like
she doesn't wanna have

42:58.088 --> 42:59.223
anything to do with you.

42:59.291 --> 43:00.794
No. No, it's genuine.

43:00.860 --> 43:02.597
It's the strangest thing.

43:02.664 --> 43:06.171
She doesn't even remember
anything about me.

43:06.237 --> 43:08.876
It sounds like
she's playing a game with you.

43:08.943 --> 43:11.181
Do hurry back, won't you,
darling?

43:15.957 --> 43:19.096
Have I mentioned how flawless
your injections look today?

43:19.163 --> 43:21.368
-Don't.
-You're gonna look 16.

43:21.435 --> 43:23.506
[laughs]

43:23.573 --> 43:25.910
Well, well, 25.

43:25.977 --> 43:28.181
Yes, yes.
Well, 25 sounds better.

43:28.248 --> 43:29.685
-I like it.
-Real 25.

43:29.751 --> 43:31.655
Oh, shut up.

43:37.266 --> 43:39.872
-Oh, my gosh. You look frozen.
-Hey.

43:39.938 --> 43:43.211
Yeah. Ooh.

43:43.279 --> 43:45.249
-Partially, yeah.
-Wow!

43:45.316 --> 43:47.621
Oh, it's getting really bad out
there.

43:47.687 --> 43:51.495
I, I hate to say it, but we-we
should probably cancel.

43:51.562 --> 43:52.998
The roads look really terrible,
and, okay,

43:53.064 --> 43:55.370
something smells crazy good
in here.

43:55.436 --> 43:58.108
You know what?
I baked some cookies.

43:58.175 --> 44:00.078
Do you wanna help me
decorate them?

44:00.145 --> 44:02.584
Yeah. You're sure?

44:02.651 --> 44:05.890
I am. Unless you're worried
about being stranded.

44:05.957 --> 44:08.195
Not unless you're worried about
me eating all your cookies.

44:08.261 --> 44:10.232
-No, I'm just staying next door.
-Perfect.

44:10.300 --> 44:11.635
I'll show you
what smells so good.

44:11.702 --> 44:12.804
All right.

44:12.871 --> 44:16.010
[instrumental music]

44:23.225 --> 44:26.264
-[Blanca] Nice job.
-Thank you.

44:28.201 --> 44:30.473
Hey, those aren't for you.

44:36.150 --> 44:37.888
I didn't think
that I could love anything

44:37.954 --> 44:41.862
more than your candy apples,
but these cookies are so good.

44:41.929 --> 44:45.035
You haven't tried
my candy apples.

44:45.102 --> 44:49.945
Right. Yeah. No, I meant, uh,
the idea of your candy apples.

44:50.012 --> 44:52.284
-Oh. Thanks.
-Yeah.

44:52.350 --> 44:54.621
You know, the coffee shop wants
a dozen of them.

44:54.688 --> 44:58.161
And if they sell tomorrow,
they'll want more.

44:58.228 --> 45:02.269
Oh. Wow.
You are pretty impressive.

45:02.337 --> 45:04.474
So how does somebody like you
not have a boyfriend?

45:04.541 --> 45:08.416
I guess, I just,
I haven't met the right person.

45:08.482 --> 45:09.618
Hm.

45:13.124 --> 45:15.663
So what's the real reason
you're here?

45:16.865 --> 45:18.268
-What do you mean?
-Well...

45:18.336 --> 45:20.205
There has to be some reason
you're not home,

45:20.272 --> 45:23.479
besides
just the dart-on-a-map story.

45:25.115 --> 45:29.758
Well, recently I lost somebody I
cared for.

45:29.825 --> 45:33.064
So I thought that maybe if I
came here,

45:33.131 --> 45:36.405
it would make them seem closer
somehow,

45:36.472 --> 45:38.643
and make some new memories.

45:38.709 --> 45:40.178
I'm so sorry.

45:40.245 --> 45:44.588
That's tough, especially
around this time of year.

45:44.655 --> 45:46.325
I actually lost my dad last
year,

45:46.392 --> 45:49.298
so I know how it feels.

45:49.364 --> 45:54.073
I never knew my mom, but my dad
and I loved Christmas.

45:54.140 --> 45:56.345
Are you ready for this?

45:56.412 --> 45:58.683
Well, I don't know if I'm ready,
but hit me with it.

45:58.749 --> 46:03.326
Okay. I love Christmas
because I was born on Christmas.

46:03.392 --> 46:05.630
-No way.
-Mm-hmm.

46:05.697 --> 46:09.738
All right, you win. Being born
on Christmas is pretty amazing.

46:09.805 --> 46:11.575
My dad thought so, too.

46:11.642 --> 46:14.982
He used to dedicate
the entire season to me.

46:15.048 --> 46:17.554
I really miss him, but I guess

46:17.620 --> 46:21.027
it's time
I make some of my own memories.

46:21.094 --> 46:24.568
Yeah. That makes us
two of a kind.

46:31.315 --> 46:35.255
Good morning, beautiful.
These are for you.

46:35.323 --> 46:38.462
Thank you. Um, they're pretty.

46:38.529 --> 46:42.704
-Um, I have some good news.
-You're starting to remember?

46:42.771 --> 46:46.345
Sorry, no. I, I made
a dozen candy apples last night.

46:46.412 --> 46:49.016
And they just this minute
sold out.

46:49.083 --> 46:50.586
That's great, really.

46:50.653 --> 46:55.496
Um, but you were building
on a candy empire at home, so...

46:55.563 --> 46:57.567
Well, I don't know
about a candy empire there,

46:57.634 --> 46:59.638
but I'm proud
of what I've done here.

46:59.705 --> 47:01.542
Of course, and you should be.

47:01.608 --> 47:04.113
You're amazing at everything
you do.

47:04.180 --> 47:06.952
And you're
the most incredible woman

47:07.019 --> 47:08.622
I've ever been matched with,

47:08.689 --> 47:11.995
the only woman I ever felt
was up to my standards.

47:12.062 --> 47:14.935
Oh. Thank you, I guess.

47:15.001 --> 47:19.176
Lucas, you make me sound like
a checklist for your standards.

47:21.013 --> 47:23.017
Could I take you to a doctor,
please? This could be serious.

47:23.084 --> 47:25.623
Can you stop saying that?
I'm perfectly fine.

47:25.690 --> 47:30.366
I'm sorry. I'm just, I'm trying
to make sense of it all.

47:30.433 --> 47:31.769
[Lucas chuckles]

47:36.912 --> 47:40.853
I've spoken with Victoria.
She's worried sick.

47:40.920 --> 47:42.791
Who is Victoria?

47:42.857 --> 47:45.396
You keep mentioning her.

47:45.463 --> 47:48.134
-She's your stepmother.
-What?

47:48.201 --> 47:49.871
No, m-my father never remarried.

47:49.938 --> 47:53.779
But he did.
And that's how you and I met.

47:53.846 --> 47:55.850
And these are the things
we need to talk about,

47:55.917 --> 47:58.823
but over dinner, not here.

48:01.260 --> 48:04.835
Okay. Okay.

48:04.901 --> 48:07.440
-How is 7:00?
-7:00 is perfect.

48:07.507 --> 48:09.478
Anything you want is perfect.

48:09.544 --> 48:11.615
All right. I'll see you then.

48:11.682 --> 48:15.456
Okay. Maybe we can find answers
together.

48:15.523 --> 48:18.429
And, please, keep an open mind.

48:18.496 --> 48:20.232
The people you can't remember

48:20.299 --> 48:22.737
are the only family
you've got now.

48:24.908 --> 48:26.010
Okay.

48:27.847 --> 48:30.787
[instrumental music]

48:46.552 --> 48:49.624
-Fancy meeting you here.
-Hey!

48:51.328 --> 48:53.299
Are you all right?

48:53.365 --> 48:55.235
Yeah, I think so.

48:55.303 --> 48:58.107
What are,
what are you doing here?

48:58.174 --> 49:02.617
Well, I came for a coffee
and a candy apple.

49:02.684 --> 49:03.986
Well, they still have coffee,

49:04.053 --> 49:06.224
but they just sold out
of my candy apples.

49:06.291 --> 49:08.329
That's great!

49:08.395 --> 49:10.198
How many do they want now?

49:10.265 --> 49:12.337
Three dozen for tomorrow.

49:14.508 --> 49:18.382
I'm so impressed.
You sure you're all right?

49:20.386 --> 49:23.592
Yeah. I just...

[Doc] Merry Christmas!

1:15:20.270 --> 1:15:22.642
Merry Christmas!
What are you guys doing here?

1:15:22.709 --> 1:15:26.115
[Hap] Come on, everybody.
Let's go in...

1:15:26.182 --> 1:15:27.652
[Hap] Heh-heh. Yeah, yeah.

1:15:28.687 --> 1:15:31.125
No, no, t-take care.

1:15:31.192 --> 1:15:34.399
-No, I don't wanna see him.
-Just hear him out.

1:15:34.466 --> 1:15:38.039
He called us. He's the reason
why we're all back.

1:15:38.106 --> 1:15:39.876
I knew you before.

1:15:39.943 --> 1:15:42.315
Not well,
but we had a connection.

1:15:42.382 --> 1:15:45.822
So when Victoria and Zane said
that you lost your memory,

1:15:45.888 --> 1:15:48.193
I came here to try
to keep you safe.

1:15:48.259 --> 1:15:50.364
They made it sound like
you were in danger.

1:15:50.431 --> 1:15:53.236
Because they put me
under some kind of crazy spell.

1:15:53.304 --> 1:15:55.107
Why didn't you
just tell me the truth?

1:15:55.173 --> 1:15:56.610
Because I didn't know
the whole truth.

1:15:56.677 --> 1:15:58.347
I tried to find the right time
to tell you,

1:15:58.414 --> 1:15:59.783
but I just found out yesterday

1:15:59.850 --> 1:16:01.286
that they just wanted me

1:16:01.353 --> 1:16:03.824
to keep you here,
not protect you.

1:16:03.891 --> 1:16:05.428
I told Victoria I wouldn't do it

1:16:05.495 --> 1:16:07.298
then she tried to bribe me
and she tried to threaten me.

1:16:07.365 --> 1:16:10.036
Because she wanted to keep me
away from the house.

1:16:10.103 --> 1:16:12.375
Victoria has never been one
to share,

1:16:12.442 --> 1:16:14.078
but this was over the line.

1:16:14.145 --> 1:16:16.249
I'm going home to deal with it
once and for all.

1:16:16.316 --> 1:16:19.356
I'm sorry
I wasn't upfront with you.

1:16:19.422 --> 1:16:20.825
I really thought
I was keeping you safe

1:16:20.892 --> 1:16:23.129
and then we got close

1:16:23.196 --> 1:16:26.035
and I-I got afraid to lose you.

1:16:26.102 --> 1:16:27.137
I thought
that'd be the worst thing.

1:16:27.204 --> 1:16:28.674
But seeing you hurt

1:16:28.741 --> 1:16:31.012
because of something I did,

1:16:31.078 --> 1:16:32.682
that's the worst thing.
And I'm so sorry.

1:16:32.749 --> 1:16:34.251
They lied to you.

1:16:34.319 --> 1:16:36.122
Victoria has a way
of manipulating things

1:16:36.189 --> 1:16:38.226
so you have no idea
what's going on.

1:16:38.294 --> 1:16:40.431
I know that more than anyone.

1:16:40.498 --> 1:16:43.604
She had me hypnotized
so I would forget everyone,

1:16:43.671 --> 1:16:45.408
including her.

1:16:45.474 --> 1:16:46.910
Well, if I learned anything
from them,

1:16:46.977 --> 1:16:50.150
I'd guess
it has to do with money.

1:16:50.217 --> 1:16:52.856
Wait. Today's my birthday.

1:16:52.922 --> 1:16:57.097
That's right. Happy birthday,
and a Merry Christmas.

1:16:57.164 --> 1:16:59.369
No, w-we're supposed
to split the estate tonight

1:16:59.436 --> 1:17:01.440
and I inherit the candy
business.

1:17:01.507 --> 1:17:03.544
Tonight at 8:00,
according to the will.

1:17:03.611 --> 1:17:07.017
Victoria's gonna steal all of
my dad's money and my company.

1:17:07.084 --> 1:17:08.387
Well, we have to stop her.

1:17:08.454 --> 1:17:10.123
If we leave just now,
we could still make it.

1:17:10.190 --> 1:17:11.593
Sounds like y'all need backup.

1:17:11.660 --> 1:17:13.564
-What are we waiting for?
-Hap, it's Christmas.

1:17:13.631 --> 1:17:15.401
Christmas is all about
taking care

1:17:15.468 --> 1:17:17.405
of the people that you love.

1:17:17.472 --> 1:17:19.074
You are important
to all of us.

1:17:19.141 --> 1:17:21.045
And this is what
The Holly Jollies do,

1:17:21.112 --> 1:17:23.617
especially on Christmas.

1:17:23.684 --> 1:17:28.694
Doc's right. This is what people
do for the people they love.

1:17:28.761 --> 1:17:31.466
Even if you can't forgive me,
at least let me help

1:17:31.533 --> 1:17:33.102
make this right.

1:17:39.081 --> 1:17:41.085
-Let's go teach them a lesson.
-Right.

1:18:09.108 --> 1:18:12.180
Well, looks like
she's not going to show up.

1:18:12.247 --> 1:18:13.350
Well, as I said before,

1:18:13.417 --> 1:18:14.452
my beautiful stepdaughter

1:18:14.519 --> 1:18:17.124
is forging her own path. Hm.

1:18:17.190 --> 1:18:19.796
I guess we can finalize this.

1:18:19.863 --> 1:18:21.132
Thank you.

1:18:26.008 --> 1:18:27.979
Victoria!

1:18:28.046 --> 1:18:29.749
Hurry!

1:18:29.816 --> 1:18:30.785
Stop!

1:18:33.056 --> 1:18:35.595
Darling! You've come back to me.

1:18:35.661 --> 1:18:36.997
No. Sorry, Lucas.

1:18:37.064 --> 1:18:38.767
I got caught up in the fantasy

1:18:38.834 --> 1:18:40.036
of things you had to offer me.

1:18:40.103 --> 1:18:41.773
That's not the real me.

1:18:41.840 --> 1:18:43.677
And it's good that the second
your true colors

1:18:43.744 --> 1:18:47.452
became clear to me, you had
already run back to Victoria.

1:18:47.518 --> 1:18:51.158
It's not happening between us,
not now, not ever!

1:18:51.927 --> 1:18:53.096
[gasps]

1:18:54.833 --> 1:18:57.872
Ooh. You should be ashamed
of yourself, Victoria.

1:18:57.939 --> 1:19:00.645
You had me hypnotized
so I would forget everything

1:19:00.711 --> 1:19:02.882
my father worked so hard
to accomplish.

1:19:02.949 --> 1:19:05.855
Also, you could pull it out
from underneath me.

1:19:05.921 --> 1:19:07.558
You know, it's interesting,
I never figured you

1:19:07.625 --> 1:19:09.462
for the materialistic type,
Blanca.

1:19:09.529 --> 1:19:11.767
You mean, like you, Victoria?
I'm not.

1:19:11.833 --> 1:19:14.439
But I certainly won't sit by
while you destroy everything

1:19:14.506 --> 1:19:16.142
my father worked so hard for,

1:19:16.208 --> 1:19:17.779
all in the name
of your own selfish vanity.

1:19:17.845 --> 1:19:19.849
-[Zane] Oh, cry me a river--
-Sit down, Zane!

1:19:19.916 --> 1:19:21.820
[gasps]

1:19:21.887 --> 1:19:24.693
Boo-hoo-hoo.

1:19:24.759 --> 1:19:29.569
Fine. So you get your half
of the estate. Who cares?

1:19:29.636 --> 1:19:32.442
Mrs. Snow,
you've committed fraud.

1:19:32.508 --> 1:19:34.211
Not only is it illegal,

1:19:34.279 --> 1:19:36.483
but there are clear stipulations
in the will

1:19:36.550 --> 1:19:37.819
that in the case of fraud,

1:19:37.885 --> 1:19:40.223
you forfeit
your portion of the estate.

1:19:40.291 --> 1:19:42.362
-What!
-[laughing]

1:19:42.428 --> 1:19:45.401
Blanca, just sign right here
and it's all yours.

1:19:45.468 --> 1:19:48.540
No! You can't get everything!
You always get everything!

1:19:48.607 --> 1:19:51.112
My father loved you, Victoria.

1:19:51.178 --> 1:19:52.582
He loved Christmas
and he wanted us

1:19:52.648 --> 1:19:56.356
to make new memories together,
to be a family.

1:19:56.423 --> 1:19:58.427
Lucky for you,
he was a very forgiving man,

1:19:58.494 --> 1:20:01.232
so I'm-I'm not gonna
press charges.

1:20:01.299 --> 1:20:03.269
I have bigger plans for you.

1:20:03.971 --> 1:20:06.242
Oh? Like what? Hm.

1:20:06.309 --> 1:20:08.447
It's Christmas, Victoria.

1:20:08.514 --> 1:20:10.418
Let's let it be a surprise.

1:20:14.893 --> 1:20:17.765
You know,
you're as beautiful as ever.

1:20:17.832 --> 1:20:20.337
You really think so?

1:20:20.404 --> 1:20:21.573
Have you ever seen
New Year's Eve

1:20:21.640 --> 1:20:23.744
from the top
of the Eiffel Tower?

1:20:23.811 --> 1:20:27.652
-With the entire Moscow Circus.
-Oui?

1:20:29.823 --> 1:20:34.198
Well, I guess everything's
kinda calmed down now.

1:20:34.264 --> 1:20:36.035
I-I should probably
get out of your way.

1:20:36.102 --> 1:20:38.373
I know that after everything,

1:20:38.440 --> 1:20:41.045
you probably don't want me
around, so...

1:20:41.112 --> 1:20:43.817
Yeah, I was really hurt.

1:20:43.884 --> 1:20:45.721
And I wish you would've just
been upfront with me

1:20:45.788 --> 1:20:47.458
from the very beginning.

1:20:47.525 --> 1:20:50.096
I mean, I-I understand the evil
web of Victoria and Zane.

1:20:50.163 --> 1:20:53.002
I really do.

1:20:53.069 --> 1:20:55.641
I just thought more of you.

1:20:55.708 --> 1:20:56.877
I'm so sorry.

1:20:56.943 --> 1:21:00.518
But then I remembered
the only thing

1:21:00.584 --> 1:21:03.557
that could break
the hypnotist's spell.

1:21:03.624 --> 1:21:06.463
And I remembered
how I felt about you.

1:21:06.530 --> 1:21:08.634
And there was only one thing

1:21:08.700 --> 1:21:12.240
that could make me remember
all of this.

1:21:14.646 --> 1:21:15.981
True love.

1:21:17.385 --> 1:21:21.058
-The kiss of true love.
-Really?

1:21:21.125 --> 1:21:22.495
If it wasn't for you staying

1:21:22.562 --> 1:21:23.931
and not telling me
why you were there,

1:21:23.997 --> 1:21:26.369
I-I would have never remembered.

1:21:26.436 --> 1:21:28.574
And Victoria would have won.

1:21:30.043 --> 1:21:32.315
You gave us time
to fall in love.

1:21:34.151 --> 1:21:36.356
-True love.
-Mm-hmm.

1:21:38.025 --> 1:21:39.329
Like this?

1:21:43.804 --> 1:21:45.574
Just like that.

1:21:47.712 --> 1:21:51.051
You are the feeling
I've been missing at Christmas.

1:21:51.118 --> 1:21:53.222
I'm so lucky I found you.

1:21:53.290 --> 1:21:55.294
I think we're both pretty lucky.

be the worst day ever

turned out to be
the best birthday ever.

that I've ever met.

something to remind you of that.
