WEBVTT

00:06.632 --> 00:07.758
Off to work!

00:07.842 --> 00:09.343
You're up early.

00:09.426 --> 00:11.428
They started doing breakfast
at the restaurant...

00:11.512 --> 00:14.348
bagels with scream cheese,
French ghost, et cetera.

00:15.432 --> 00:16.684
Morning, Lillian.

00:16.767 --> 00:18.018
Hi, hi.

00:18.101 --> 00:19.478
- Aah!
- Good morning, Lillian.

00:19.561 --> 00:22.105
Just need to use the facilities.

00:22.189 --> 00:24.316
What a disaster.

00:24.399 --> 00:25.943
Oh, a text.

00:26.025 --> 00:27.361
I wonder who it's from.

00:27.444 --> 00:29.380
It's from Jacqueline.
She's the only one who ever texts you.

00:29.404 --> 00:32.700
I'll have you know I also get texts
from the ex-girlfriend of the guy

00:32.783 --> 00:33.983
who had this number before me.

00:34.034 --> 00:37.037
She has HPV, and she hopes I have it too.

00:37.120 --> 00:39.373
It's Jacqueline asking you to do something

00:39.456 --> 00:40.541
she can do herself.

00:40.624 --> 00:41.917
Wrong.

00:42.001 --> 00:43.669
It's the president.

00:43.752 --> 00:47.130
And he needs me to turn on
Ms. White's coffeemaker.

00:49.216 --> 00:50.342
Done.

00:51.092 --> 00:53.052
<i>Power on.</i>

00:53.136 --> 00:54.638
Why are you licking them like that?

00:54.722 --> 00:55.931
Who's that for?

00:56.015 --> 00:58.308
They'll know.

00:58.392 --> 01:02.270
So, Kimmy, what do you think?

01:02.354 --> 01:05.105
Turtle Island? That sounds cool.

01:05.190 --> 01:07.902
"Turtle Island" is a Native term
for America.

01:07.985 --> 01:09.403
What? But that's way better.

01:09.486 --> 01:10.612
Why'd we change it?

01:10.696 --> 01:12.155
At the Olympics, it'd be like,

01:12.239 --> 01:14.115
"And the gold medal for handstands

01:14.199 --> 01:16.952
goes to Kimmy Schmidt of Turtle Island."

01:17.036 --> 01:19.997
Turtle Island! Turtle Island!

01:20.080 --> 01:22.708
Kimmy, we're two weeks away
from the greatest charity event

01:22.791 --> 01:24.167
this town has ever seen.

01:24.251 --> 01:27.254
Mimi is taking care of the invitations.

01:27.337 --> 01:29.256
But there's so much else to do.

01:29.339 --> 01:32.133
I'll just lick these all day
and then have a sensible dinner.

01:32.217 --> 01:34.469
I need you to go buy alcohol
for 200 people.

01:34.553 --> 01:36.764
But I can't buy alcohol.
I don't have an ID.

01:36.847 --> 01:38.515
Well, then go to the DMV and get one.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.099
Ugh, not the DMV.

01:40.183 --> 01:41.685
That place is the worst,

01:41.769 --> 01:45.022
based on my knowledge
of '90s stand-up comedy.

01:45.064 --> 01:47.942
I'd rather try to open a bag of peanuts
on an airplane.

01:49.735 --> 01:51.695
What's the deal with those?

01:51.779 --> 01:53.614
Right?

01:53.697 --> 01:57.993
What else? What else?

01:58.077 --> 02:00.746
Fine, I'll go after my paying job

02:00.829 --> 02:01.997
that I'm already late for.

02:02.081 --> 02:03.082
Dang it!

02:04.917 --> 02:09.045
What a third wheel, right?

02:11.673 --> 02:13.008
Well, deck the halls.

02:13.092 --> 02:15.510
Look who decided to show up.

02:15.594 --> 02:16.511
I'm sorry, Terry.

02:16.595 --> 02:18.388
I was helping a friend
with her coffeemaker.

02:18.472 --> 02:19.514
And the last time?

02:19.598 --> 02:21.325
The same friend needed me
to paint her stolen police car

02:21.349 --> 02:22.893
to look like a black Mercedes.

02:22.977 --> 02:26.480
Kimmy, remind me,
where do Santa's elves work?

02:26.563 --> 02:29.274
Is it a goof-around shop or a play shop?

02:29.357 --> 02:31.234
Or is it a screw-your-boss-raw shop?

02:31.318 --> 02:33.088
Because that's what this
is starting to feel like.

02:33.112 --> 02:34.279
It's a workshop, sir.

02:34.362 --> 02:35.656
It won't happen again.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.077
Now clean that up.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.709
I'm cooking.

02:49.000 --> 02:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:58.887 --> 03:00.179
I know why I'm home early.

03:00.263 --> 03:02.724
The oohmelet bar set a mummy on fire.

03:02.808 --> 03:03.934
What are you doing here?

03:04.018 --> 03:05.411
I need to find a bill with my name on it

03:05.435 --> 03:07.186
so I can get an ID.

03:07.270 --> 03:09.023
Bingo! Columbia House.

03:09.106 --> 03:10.482
Now I need to run to the DMV.

03:10.565 --> 03:12.109
Ugh, the lines there are so long,

03:12.191 --> 03:14.838
I feel like I'm waiting for my ex-wife
to come back from the bathroom.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.340
Ladies, why you got to go in groups?

03:17.364 --> 03:18.490
What's so great in there?

03:18.573 --> 03:20.259
Val Kilmer set up a kissing booth
or something?

03:21.660 --> 03:23.178
Then I need to get back
to the Christmas store

03:23.202 --> 03:24.705
before my lunch break is over.

03:24.788 --> 03:27.206
I was late again
because I was helping Ms. White.

03:27.290 --> 03:30.293
Okay, Kimmy, I have been exploited
in the past.

03:30.377 --> 03:33.505
I once went to an open audition
that was just a bum fight.

03:33.588 --> 03:35.090
She's not exploiting me.

03:35.174 --> 03:37.676
You cannot let that woman get in the way
of your paycheck.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.803
Our budget is based
on a two-income household.

03:39.887 --> 03:43.182
Or would you like to send
this month's tape back to Columbia House?

03:43.264 --> 03:44.474
This won't affect the tapes.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.309
The <i>Wayne's World 2 </i> soundtrack is coming.

03:46.393 --> 03:47.895
That's what you're playing with.

03:47.978 --> 03:50.064
I can be a good elf and a good friend.

03:52.399 --> 03:53.775
Yes, it's Ms. White.

03:53.859 --> 03:56.570
She probably just wants to see
how her good friend Kimmy is.

03:56.653 --> 03:58.238
She needs something else.

03:58.321 --> 04:02.910
Wait, why is my phone asking me
to select a wireless network?

04:02.993 --> 04:05.453
A wireless network?
Who has "wiffee" around here?

04:05.537 --> 04:07.515
'Cause I sincerely doubt that the guy
who sells socks

04:07.539 --> 04:10.500
by the overpass is providing
high-speed Internet to the community.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.502
Wait a minute.
Slow down with all the tech talk.

04:12.586 --> 04:13.628
Socks?

04:13.712 --> 04:16.339
Kim, let me explain
how the Internet works.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.132
See, it's not a big truck.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.843
It's a series of tubes,

04:19.927 --> 04:21.687
and those tubes are filled
with the Internet.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.304
And it's coming here through the air.

04:23.388 --> 04:26.225
That's probably what's making
the apartment smell like farts.

04:26.307 --> 04:28.227
Mm-hmm.

04:28.309 --> 04:31.980
We're online! Like scientists!

04:33.023 --> 04:33.899
Do I!

04:33.982 --> 04:35.626
'Cause my roommate is trying to get fired,

04:35.650 --> 04:37.587
and it's only a matter of time
before I take a weird stand

04:37.611 --> 04:39.071
about something at work.

04:41.281 --> 04:44.576
Wait, so it's like a sleepover
with strangers?

04:44.659 --> 04:46.912
- But they pay us?
- I'm doing it.

04:46.995 --> 04:48.956
I'm putting our apartment in the phone.

04:49.039 --> 04:51.125
What's a cozy uptown duck palace?

04:51.208 --> 04:52.626

Why are we lisping?

05:30.664 --> 05:32.166
We are not lisping.

05:32.249 --> 05:33.667
I shattered a tooth.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.169
Stop saying "S" s, stupid.

05:35.252 --> 05:36.295
One moment.

05:36.377 --> 05:38.630
You have to talk to the dentist.

05:38.713 --> 05:40.548
They're not taking me seriously.

05:40.632 --> 05:41.776
That's why you called me over?

05:41.800 --> 05:43.051
I got to get back to work.

05:43.135 --> 05:45.846
Say you're me
and you have to get in today.

05:47.097 --> 05:48.640
Hello, poppets!

05:48.723 --> 05:50.600
I don't talk like Mrs. Doubtfire.

05:50.684 --> 05:53.812
It's always weird to hear your own voice.

05:53.895 --> 05:55.623
I asked the doctor,
but the soonest I can get you in

05:55.647 --> 05:57.065
is in three weeks.

05:57.149 --> 05:58.626
It's the beginning of bleaching season,

05:58.650 --> 06:00.235
and people tend to start with the teeth

06:00.319 --> 06:01.444
and work their way down.

06:01.528 --> 06:04.323
Oh, children!

06:04.405 --> 06:07.034
And I see here that you're no longer
on Mr. Voorhees' plan,

06:07.117 --> 06:09.494
so please be sure to bring
some form of payment.

06:09.577 --> 06:12.122
Do you not understand
this is an emergency?

06:12.206 --> 06:14.373
I get making people wait for a kidney,

06:14.457 --> 06:16.710
but this is something people can see.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.795
The mouth is the eyes of the lower face.

06:20.130 --> 06:22.257
Excuse me. Thank you.

06:22.341 --> 06:23.342
She needs to be walked.

06:23.424 --> 06:24.759
And keep her Instagram updated.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.471
I got the stamps!

06:28.555 --> 06:30.891
Unlike my ex-husband, they're forever.

06:34.561 --> 06:37.189
I can't host a gala like this.

06:37.272 --> 06:40.901
A New York philanthropist can be missing
many things...

06:40.984 --> 06:42.443
an eye, a leg...

06:42.527 --> 06:43.611
A toenail if it's winter?

06:43.695 --> 06:45.072
Shut up, Mimi.

06:45.155 --> 06:47.324
But not a tooth, never a tooth.

06:47.406 --> 06:49.826
There's a dentist in my neighborhood
named Señor Dentista.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.786
He does walk-ins, and his bus ads make it

06:51.870 --> 06:53.538
very clear that he does not snitch.

06:53.621 --> 06:55.665
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear
any of that.

06:55.749 --> 06:59.836
But what I will do is show up
at Dr. Weitz's office

06:59.920 --> 07:04.049
and in-charm-idate myself
into an appointment.

07:04.132 --> 07:05.842
But what if someone sees you?

07:05.926 --> 07:07.802
Teeth are the boobs of the mouth.

07:16.144 --> 07:17.854
<i>The Freshmaker.</i>

07:17.938 --> 07:19.480
<i>Power off.</i>

07:23.193 --> 07:25.653
Lillian, do you have a spare key
to our apartment?

07:25.737 --> 07:27.989
Why? You know our locks
are just decorative.

07:28.073 --> 07:30.409
I rented my apartment on AirBnB.com,

07:30.491 --> 07:33.703
not to be confused with BearDinB.com,

07:33.787 --> 07:34.704
which is awful.

07:36.290 --> 07:38.041
I breathe like that sometimes.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.167
But also...

07:39.251 --> 07:40.752
How could you?

07:40.835 --> 07:44.589
What were you thinking bringing
Internet people into our neighborhood?

07:44.672 --> 07:46.883
I was thinking I could get $80 to buy

07:46.967 --> 07:48.551
a wonderful box of capes that I saw

07:48.635 --> 07:50.053
at a medical supply store.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.013
Don't you get it? They're hipsters.

07:52.097 --> 07:54.474
And that means gentrification.

07:54.557 --> 07:56.476
Ugh! Listen to me.

07:56.559 --> 07:59.438
I miss the old days
when the longest word I knew

07:59.520 --> 08:01.398
was friggingiuliani!

08:01.481 --> 08:03.024
They're not hipsters.

08:03.108 --> 08:06.236
They're just two hayseeds from Texas
whose bodies

08:06.320 --> 08:08.738
will wash up in the East River
in a couple of weeks...

08:08.822 --> 08:10.824
crabs eating their eyes,

08:10.907 --> 08:13.201
their genitalia stuffed in their mouths.

08:13.285 --> 08:15.454
Stop telling me what I want to hear.

08:15.536 --> 08:18.539
I like the neighborhood the way it is.

08:19.374 --> 08:21.293
Morning, Meth-Head Charlie!

08:21.376 --> 08:23.086
It's my TV!

08:23.170 --> 08:24.545
Well, it doesn't matter.

08:24.629 --> 08:26.673
Our guests will be here later today.

08:30.260 --> 08:32.304
Now imagine that exit with a cape.

08:35.682 --> 08:37.600
I have a 2:30 appointment with Dr. Weitz,

08:37.683 --> 08:39.477
Jacqueline White.

08:39.559 --> 08:40.871
Ms. White, you don't have
an appointment today.

08:40.895 --> 08:42.481
Well, someone made a mistake.

08:42.605 --> 08:44.899
I spoke with this horrible woman
on the phone earlier.

08:44.983 --> 08:46.443
- That was me.
- I like your nails.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.611
- In I go.
- Dr. Weitz's schedule is full.

08:48.695 --> 08:51.614
Look, I know Dr. Weitz personally.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.074
I saw his daughter do ballet,

08:53.158 --> 08:54.993
even though she doesn't have
the body for it.

08:55.076 --> 08:57.078
But my name is on the list.

08:57.162 --> 08:58.497
I left my purse inside.

08:58.579 --> 08:59.831
I used to live here.

08:59.914 --> 09:03.210
Do you have any idea how much money
I donate to this opera?

09:03.293 --> 09:06.338
Oh, hello, dear! I think...

09:16.597 --> 09:20.018
Well, I hope you're proud of yourself.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.153

09:30.237 --> 09:31.738

cease your magic!

09:34.241 --> 09:36.243

09:36.326 --> 09:38.619
Terry, I know I'm late, but my friend

09:38.703 --> 09:40.247
is having a tooth emergency.

09:40.330 --> 09:42.499
Friend? Look around you.

09:42.582 --> 09:46.586
This is not the kind of business
for people who have friends.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.523
Kimmy, you're done here.
Clean out your stocking.

09:48.547 --> 09:49.589
What?

09:49.672 --> 09:51.091
No, sir, I need this job.

09:51.174 --> 09:52.174
I love working here.

09:52.217 --> 09:53.634
It's Christmas every day.

09:53.718 --> 09:55.554
You can't fire me on Christmas.

09:55.636 --> 09:57.805
I'm gonna need your jingle bells back.

09:59.057 --> 10:00.559
I lost them.

10:01.851 --> 10:03.644
<i>♪ Ding-dong, it's Christmas ♪</i>

10:05.522 --> 10:07.232
Good news, K-PAX.

10:07.315 --> 10:08.858
I rented the apartment on tubes.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.777
I left a key under the mat,
and now we just

10:10.860 --> 10:13.100
let the cape money roll in
while we sleep at the library.

10:13.154 --> 10:14.798
By the way, we're sleeping at the library.

10:14.822 --> 10:16.491
Well, I'm glad you're making money.

10:16.575 --> 10:17.951
I just got fired.

10:18.034 --> 10:20.287
And before you say anything,
it's not Ms. White's fault.

10:20.370 --> 10:23.081
I should be able to help my friends
and have a job.

10:23.164 --> 10:25.750
That's a cakewalk
compared to what Santa does.

10:25.833 --> 10:28.002
Delivering presents all over the world
in one night?

10:28.086 --> 10:29.254
Wait.

10:29.337 --> 10:30.565
You think Santa... You know what?

10:30.589 --> 10:32.132
Now's not the time.

10:32.215 --> 10:34.717
Look, maybe Ms. White
takes me for granted sometimes.

10:34.801 --> 10:40.098
And the award for understatement
of the year goes to...

10:40.181 --> 10:43.851
Kimmy Schmidt for, "Ms. White
takes me for granted sometimes."

10:45.186 --> 10:46.813
But she needs my help.

10:46.896 --> 10:49.441
And thanks to her,
I got my learner's permit.

10:49.524 --> 10:51.419
A rat fell from the ceiling
when they took the picture.

10:51.443 --> 10:52.777
Ew.

10:52.860 --> 10:54.046
Sure, the Christmas store was cool,

10:54.070 --> 10:56.072
and I loved wearing a little hat.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.532
But I can find a better job.

10:57.616 --> 11:00.285
I'll just get a newspaper... Wait.

11:00.368 --> 11:02.120
If I find a job in the classifieds,

11:02.203 --> 11:03.455
am I allowed to tell anyone?

11:05.999 --> 11:07.417
Hi, Ms. White.

11:07.501 --> 11:09.877
I'm sort of busy
with career stuff right now,

11:09.961 --> 11:12.046
so unless it's an emergency... It is?

11:12.130 --> 11:14.174
I'm coming. I'm coming.

11:14.257 --> 11:17.594
And the award for most gullible woman
alive goes to...

11:17.676 --> 11:18.677
Julianne Moore!

11:18.761 --> 11:19.971
I love her!

11:20.054 --> 11:22.056
Julianne is filming in Prague.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.058
I accept this award on her behalf.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.651
Hey. You got your tooth fixed.

11:32.733 --> 11:35.778
This, Kimmy, is a French-manicured
press-on nail

11:35.862 --> 11:37.947
that I purchased at a car wash gift shop

11:38.031 --> 11:39.824
after the Mento didn't work.

11:39.907 --> 11:41.451
The Mento didn't work?

11:41.535 --> 11:43.203
I think the glue got in the nerve.

11:43.286 --> 11:45.205
My mouth is killing me.

11:45.288 --> 11:49.417
I can't believe it's come to this,
but I need to go to Doctor Dentista.

11:49.501 --> 11:51.545
Wait, you want me to drive?

11:51.628 --> 11:53.880
I am in so much pain, Kimmy.
I'm seeing double.

11:53.963 --> 11:57.050
Well, I guess I have had
some driving lessons.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.677
Cut the wheel! Harder!

11:58.759 --> 12:00.428
You drive just like your mother!

12:00.512 --> 12:01.804
You're making me more nervous.

12:01.888 --> 12:03.682
- I need my tunes.
- Click.

12:03.764 --> 12:06.767
This is Shadoe Stevens counting down
today's top hits.

12:06.851 --> 12:10.313
Coming in at number 12,
a little of that SoCal sound.

12:10.397 --> 12:11.231
<i>♪ Some... ♪</i>

12:11.314 --> 12:12.674
Turn off that garbage!

12:13.941 --> 12:15.068
I can do this.

12:15.151 --> 12:18.655
I just have to remember the advice
Donna Maria ended all her lessons with.

12:18.737 --> 12:21.575
I'm sick of this stupid game.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.702
We're all going to die down here!

12:29.916 --> 12:33.336
Hello, you must be the lodgers.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.589
I'm your landlordess, Lillian.

12:35.672 --> 12:36.715
- Oh.
- Oh, hi.

12:36.797 --> 12:40.009
I'm Bob Thompstein.
This is my wife, Sue Thompstein.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.928
- Hey.
- Thompstein?

12:42.011 --> 12:43.388
That's unusual.

12:43.471 --> 12:46.391
Oh, yeah, it's a combo
of both of our last names.

12:46.474 --> 12:48.976
- Bob felt...
- Classic Bob.

12:49.060 --> 12:52.439
I didn't know they did
stuff like that in Texas.

12:52.522 --> 12:53.957
- Oh, well, we're from Austin.
- Yeah.

12:53.981 --> 12:55.942
How wonderful.

12:56.025 --> 12:59.654
And how long have you had
the mustache, Bob?

12:59.738 --> 13:01.780
Oh, a couple years.

13:01.864 --> 13:05.118
I saw Michael Cera grow one,
and I was like,

13:05.201 --> 13:07.245
"That's hilarious. I'm in."

13:07.328 --> 13:08.162
Yeah.

13:08.246 --> 13:11.416
And what do you two do for work?

13:11.499 --> 13:13.752
For...

13:13.834 --> 13:15.754
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:15.836 --> 13:19.716
I mean, can you believe that you get paid

13:19.798 --> 13:22.176
to follow your bliss?

13:22.260 --> 13:24.178
- Right?
- Yeah, Bob's a sneaker artist.

13:24.262 --> 13:26.847
And I do digital outreach
for South by Southwest.

13:26.931 --> 13:31.394
Are you now or have you ever been
a member of Arcade Fire?

13:31.478 --> 13:36.274
Um, yeah, so we actually, like,
really have to get changed

13:36.357 --> 13:39.319
because we have tickets to go see
these malfunctioning

13:39.402 --> 13:43.197
Chuck E. Cheese characters
reenact an episode of <i>Full House.</i>

13:48.369 --> 13:50.288
Ms. White,
I know you don't feel well,

13:50.371 --> 13:52.415
but I'll be Michael Knight,
and you be KITT.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.375
And when I say, "Activate turbo boost,"

13:54.459 --> 13:57.629
you say, "We're approaching
a residential area."

13:57.712 --> 13:59.547
Will you be quiet?

13:59.631 --> 14:03.468
Stop acting like every day
is kindergarten show-and-tell.

14:03.551 --> 14:07.388
What, do you want a sticker that says
"great driving" or something?

14:07.472 --> 14:08.949
I can tell by the way you're saying it,

14:08.973 --> 14:10.224
you don't actually have one.

14:10.308 --> 14:12.477
Please, just shut up and drive.

14:14.729 --> 14:16.564
You know, I was fired today.

14:16.648 --> 14:18.065
I could really use a friend to...

14:27.450 --> 14:29.035
Looking for something?

14:32.121 --> 14:34.332
Damn it, Lillian,
I just washed these pants.

14:34.415 --> 14:36.835
That's a lie, and you know it.

14:36.917 --> 14:40.254
Forgot your Barbie night-light,
didn't you?

14:40.338 --> 14:42.590
I knew you couldn't spend the night alone

14:42.674 --> 14:45.092
without her in that scary library.

14:45.176 --> 14:47.345
Please, what's scary about books?

14:47.428 --> 14:50.348
Just a bunch of leather-bound paper
that used to be cows and trees,

14:50.431 --> 14:53.267
and they won't rest until we pay
for what we've done to them.

14:53.351 --> 14:56.396
I met Bob and Sue, Titus.

14:56.479 --> 15:00.024
They are not a nice couple from Texas.

15:00.107 --> 15:01.651
They're hipsters.

15:01.735 --> 15:04.612
Oh, you think I'm crazy
just because they named

15:04.696 --> 15:06.614
that disorder after me.

15:06.698 --> 15:08.533
But this time, I'm right.

15:10.201 --> 15:13.830
Look, look what I found in their luggage.

15:13.913 --> 15:17.166
"Sole Food: an artisanal fair trade
sneaker experience."

15:17.250 --> 15:19.960
We already have a way to get sneakers
around here.

15:20.044 --> 15:22.505
We wait till they fall off
the telephone wire.

15:22.589 --> 15:25.550
Hmm, and they want to open Sole Food
in an old soul food restaurant,

15:25.633 --> 15:28.344
like how the first Hooters
was opened in an old mammogram center?

15:28.428 --> 15:32.724
And what is the only soul food restaurant
left around here?

15:32.807 --> 15:33.974
Mabel's.

15:34.058 --> 15:35.685
So? That place is gross.

15:35.769 --> 15:38.369
I only eat there to get food poisoning
before bathing suit season.

15:38.396 --> 15:40.189
It's not gross to me.

15:40.273 --> 15:43.359
And it wasn't gross to my late husband,
Roland.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.653
Until recently, I couldn't even have
a dead husband,

15:45.737 --> 15:47.488
so #RespectMyJourney.

15:47.572 --> 15:50.450
Mabel's was our place,

15:50.533 --> 15:52.326
Roland and me.

15:52.410 --> 15:54.995
We made our best memories there.

15:57.582 --> 15:59.894
What do you think about this sweet lick,
my funky little mama?

16:02.670 --> 16:04.464
It's beautiful.

16:04.547 --> 16:05.632
What do you call it?

16:05.715 --> 16:07.801
I call it "Lillian:

16:07.884 --> 16:10.470
Will You Marry Me, My Honky Princess?"

16:14.474 --> 16:17.143
Also, we made love there a bunch.

16:17.226 --> 16:19.061
I'm sorry, but things change.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.465
I mean, I don't look anything like I did
when I was a baby.

16:22.398 --> 16:23.650
Okay, bad example.

16:23.733 --> 16:26.193
Someday you'll be that crazy old kook

16:26.277 --> 16:28.279
who doesn't want things to change

16:28.362 --> 16:30.239
and who clings to the past

16:30.323 --> 16:33.159
and who pees a little
during long speeches.

16:33.242 --> 16:36.329
And when that day comes,
I hope it's not too late

16:36.412 --> 16:38.832
for you to save the things you love.

16:38.915 --> 16:40.100
That would have been better
with a cape.

16:40.124 --> 16:41.835
My hair is a cape.

16:53.262 --> 16:55.890
Oh, sure, let me get the door,
Your Highness.

16:55.974 --> 16:58.434
Would you also like me to fan you
with a big leaf?

16:58.518 --> 17:00.937
Oh, that leaf isn't big enough?
A thousand apologies.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.957
I'll just ask the leaf keeper
for his biggest leaf

17:02.981 --> 17:04.440
for Her Excellency.

17:06.483 --> 17:08.277
This is worse than childbirth,

17:08.361 --> 17:11.321
and Buckley initially tried to <i>Alien</i>
his way out of me.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.826
Doctor Dentista? What's going on?

17:14.909 --> 17:17.453
No, no, no, no. It's Señor Dentista.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.246
I am not a doctor.

17:19.329 --> 17:22.165
And this is me going out of business.

17:22.249 --> 17:25.085
- No!
- Ah, you speak Spanish.

17:25.169 --> 17:28.840
<i>Sí, </i> the rent in this neighborhood
is out of control.

17:28.923 --> 17:32.886
Twenty years ago, I won some
dental equipment in a poker game.

17:32.969 --> 17:35.805
And now there's only one thing left to do.

17:39.684 --> 17:41.352
It's over!

17:41.435 --> 17:43.479
Let go, Dante.

17:45.565 --> 17:46.858
Let go.

17:49.318 --> 17:50.361
Shh.

17:50.444 --> 17:51.755
This isn't happening.

17:51.779 --> 17:53.656
This is not my life.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.617
Is this the part of town
where flies are made?

17:56.701 --> 17:58.160
You know I live here, right?

17:58.244 --> 17:59.620
Look at me.

17:59.704 --> 18:01.372
I can't get medical care.

18:01.455 --> 18:05.877
I'm standing on a street
named after a rapper, I guess.

18:08.462 --> 18:10.715
Malcolm the Tenth was a black pope.

18:10.798 --> 18:11.925
So that's it.

18:12.008 --> 18:14.343
I'm just one bad tooth away from...

18:14.427 --> 18:15.845
from turning into you.

18:15.929 --> 18:17.304
You know what, Ms. White?

18:17.388 --> 18:19.057
Maybe you should turn into me.

18:19.139 --> 18:20.975
Because I appreciate people.

18:21.059 --> 18:24.311
I say things like "thank you"
and "great honking."

18:24.395 --> 18:26.397
And if you were me, you might realize

18:26.480 --> 18:28.858
that you-me should be nice to me-me.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.359
Because you're not being a friend.

18:30.443 --> 18:33.404
You're being a grade-A jerk brain.

18:33.487 --> 18:35.155
Oh, so the best jerk brain.

18:35.239 --> 18:37.658
For once, put yourself
in someone else's shoes.

18:37.742 --> 18:38.993
Jesus, no!

18:39.077 --> 18:41.120
They look like they're from
a restaurant dumpster.

18:41.203 --> 18:44.123
They fell off a telephone wire,
and I ran to them fastest.

18:44.206 --> 18:45.041
Baby, come here.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.844
It's a meth-head fighting
with a prostitute.

18:46.918 --> 18:50.212
This neighborhood is so authentic.

18:50.296 --> 18:51.982
Why do people always think
I'm a prostitute?

18:52.006 --> 18:54.801
No, I'm having a medical emer... Oh, God.

18:54.884 --> 18:56.844
I just swallowed my nail tip.

18:56.928 --> 18:58.888
- This is so great.
- It's gonna be perfect.

18:58.972 --> 19:00.180
This is gonna be perfect.

19:00.264 --> 19:02.182
My gala is in two weeks.

19:02.266 --> 19:03.977
I'm trying to change the world,

19:04.060 --> 19:05.853
and you can't do that by being nice.

19:05.937 --> 19:07.229
Well, maybe I'll act like you

19:07.313 --> 19:08.856
and only care about my own stuff.

19:08.940 --> 19:11.150
So if you want me to do anything for you,

19:11.233 --> 19:13.945
like drive you home right now,
you're gonna have to pay me.

19:14.028 --> 19:15.279
Fine.

19:15.362 --> 19:18.240
Because you're my employee.

19:18.324 --> 19:19.909
And nothing more.

19:19.993 --> 19:21.911
Fine by me, boss.

19:21.995 --> 19:24.872
But you will be buying me a little hat.

19:29.168 --> 19:32.296
<i>♪ Got $80, gonna buy a box of capes ♪</i>

19:32.379 --> 19:34.132
<i>♪ Can't live in the past ♪</i>

19:35.299 --> 19:36.884
What the hell is a vape?

19:38.469 --> 19:40.471
What in the world?

19:44.142 --> 19:45.893
So we're not friends now.

19:45.977 --> 19:47.478
So she's my employee now.

19:47.561 --> 19:48.562
This is way better.

19:48.646 --> 19:50.373
I don't have to worry
about her dumb problems

19:50.397 --> 19:51.397
or her fancy-pants life.

19:51.440 --> 19:52.859
I'm social royalty.

19:52.942 --> 19:54.777
She grew up drinking Kool-Aid
on that tractor

19:54.861 --> 19:56.403
that her mother wanted her to marry.

19:56.487 --> 19:59.323
From now on, all I care about
is getting paid, yo.

19:59.406 --> 20:02.660
Like the dad from <i>Mary Poppins</i>
before he got them kites, son!

20:02.743 --> 20:05.121
Just because she can pull off that hat

20:05.204 --> 20:07.289
and I can't because
of my weird-shaped head,

20:07.373 --> 20:08.624
but that's between us, me.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.710
I'm done with her.

20:14.088 --> 20:15.565
Wait here for me, driver.

20:15.589 --> 20:17.424
What? No, I can't stay here.

20:17.508 --> 20:19.552
And I can't circle the block
without you in the car.

20:19.635 --> 20:20.928
I only have a learner's permit.

20:21.012 --> 20:22.698
Well, you should've thought of that
before you chose

20:22.722 --> 20:24.724
to live underground for 15 years.

20:30.604 --> 20:33.315
If you're a Transformer,
transform and fly out of here.

20:33.399 --> 20:35.234
No, don't! I'll be crushed!

20:38.112 --> 20:40.573
Did you get the address?

20:40.656 --> 20:41.657
Are you my Uber?

20:41.741 --> 20:45.036
Are you a licensed driver
over the age of 25?

20:46.829 --> 20:49.165
Then I'm your Uber.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.125
Wait a second, you're not Mamadou.

20:52.501 --> 20:54.181
- This is just too good.
- It's everything.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.713
- It's so good.
- It's everything.

20:55.796 --> 20:59.550
Oh, you going to Mabel's? Bad idea.

20:59.633 --> 21:01.844
They don't wash the knives in there,

21:01.928 --> 21:06.682
so when you get stabbed,
it's really bad... When.

21:06.766 --> 21:09.769
- Babe, did you hear that?
- Yeah. Uh-huh.

21:09.852 --> 21:11.353
People still get stabbed around here.

21:11.437 --> 21:14.023
I know. I cannot believe we beat the gays
to this neighborhood.

21:14.107 --> 21:16.192
Okay, let's go get some Polaroids.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.035
- Yeah.
- Let's send them to our Design Yuko.

21:18.069 --> 21:19.319
- Okay.
- Okay?

21:19.403 --> 21:20.320
Namaste.

21:24.366 --> 21:25.910
Everything.

21:25.993 --> 21:27.578
The Shoemidor will go right here.

21:27.661 --> 21:29.956
Obviously.

21:30.039 --> 21:31.498
What the hell?

21:31.582 --> 21:32.959
Do you have a rezzie?

21:34.127 --> 21:35.127
Vation?

21:35.169 --> 21:37.922
For what? This place is empty.

21:38.005 --> 21:40.382
Unless there's a secret password-protected

21:40.466 --> 21:43.343
after-hours speakeasy behind that door.

21:43.427 --> 21:46.013
Egg! Shyamalan! Ojai!

21:46.097 --> 21:47.932
Oh, my God. Are you trying?

21:48.015 --> 21:50.268
Ew.

21:50.350 --> 21:51.518
Lates, Chaz.

21:51.602 --> 21:53.980
See you at Portlandia's for Skee-Ball.

21:54.063 --> 21:55.856
TTYL, Kainoah.

21:55.940 --> 21:57.858
First I'm hitting that sneaker store

21:57.942 --> 22:01.320
someone opened in the dairy case
at Key Foods.

22:03.405 --> 22:04.907
Another sneakertorium?

22:04.991 --> 22:06.993
But we already applied to Saint Ann's.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.873
- Die, hipster scum!
- No, no, no, Lillian!

22:12.957 --> 22:14.834
It's me, your Titus.

22:14.917 --> 22:16.418
My Titus.

22:16.502 --> 22:17.502
Oh.

22:23.092 --> 22:24.927
Where's my driver?

22:41.986 --> 22:43.988
And I thought we were pathetic.

22:48.075 --> 22:50.452
Oh, my God, desk lady?

22:50.536 --> 22:52.330
I didn't know she had legs.

22:53.413 --> 22:55.541
Of course.

22:55.624 --> 22:57.543
Happy birthday, Linda.

23:08.846 --> 23:10.223
Excuse me.

23:10.306 --> 23:11.598
Do you know who I am?

23:11.682 --> 23:13.517
I'm sorry. That came out wrong.

23:13.600 --> 23:15.186
Do you know who I am?

23:15.269 --> 23:16.729
I know who you are, Ms. White.

23:16.812 --> 23:20.440
Look, I'm not the best at...

23:20.524 --> 23:23.069
I'm sorry, okay?

23:23.152 --> 23:26.404
I'm sorry about the way I spoke to you
yesterday.

23:26.488 --> 23:27.823
So here.

23:27.907 --> 23:29.742
No, Ms. White, I can't take your shoes.

23:29.825 --> 23:32.410
Please, just make sure
all of Dr. Weitz's patients

23:32.494 --> 23:33.704
see you wearing these.

23:33.787 --> 23:36.582
They'll spend all day wondering
whose husband you're sleeping with.

23:36.665 --> 23:38.334
It'll drive them insane.

23:48.677 --> 23:50.804
I see you got your central incisor fixed.

23:50.888 --> 23:55.768
No, these are a part of a sexy Joe Biden
Halloween costume.

23:58.396 --> 24:01.274
So what made you come to your senses?

24:01.357 --> 24:04.110
I found out where the free "wiffee"
was coming from.

24:04.193 --> 24:06.612
Lillian, Pawn Werlt got gentrified.

24:06.695 --> 24:07.905
It's a vape shop now.

24:07.988 --> 24:10.908
That place is where we first met.

24:10.991 --> 24:13.493
These are vintage "Borbie" dolls.

24:13.577 --> 24:16.580
I will not accept anything less
than $1,000 for them.

24:16.663 --> 24:17.873
I'll give you $6.

24:17.957 --> 24:19.292
Eight!

24:19.375 --> 24:23.087
Look, I'm broke. $7, final offer.

24:23.170 --> 24:24.647
Okay, four, and I'll also dance for you.

24:24.671 --> 24:26.757
No. Excuse me, excuse me. Listen, listen.

24:26.840 --> 24:29.802
Mister, don't let this guy
take advantage of you.

24:29.885 --> 24:30.761
It doesn't matter.

24:30.844 --> 24:31.971
I'm leaving New York.

24:32.054 --> 24:33.931
Wait, no.

24:34.014 --> 24:35.975
No, you're not. Listen.

24:36.058 --> 24:39.395
I got a basement room that nobody wants.

24:39.477 --> 24:42.106
I'll give you a couple months' free rent

24:42.189 --> 24:45.359
in exchange for some of that dancing.

24:46.235 --> 24:47.945
Titus Andromedon.

24:48.028 --> 24:49.447
You don't need to know.

24:49.529 --> 24:50.614
It's gone?

24:50.697 --> 24:52.241
Gone, gone, gone.

24:52.325 --> 24:54.034
Like cut-up doughnuts after church.

24:54.118 --> 24:55.762
But if those beardos think
they're gonna come in here

24:55.786 --> 24:57.579
and destroy our memories without a fight...

24:57.663 --> 25:01.625
They picked the wrong neighborhood
to try to improve.

25:06.380 --> 25:09.716
Is this where
the secret speakeasy is?

25:15.306 --> 25:16.932
They're coming.

25:24.982 --> 25:26.317
Hey, Ms. White.

25:26.400 --> 25:28.526
I brought your car back.

25:28.610 --> 25:30.488
Oh, you got your tooth fixed.

25:30.570 --> 25:34.116
My new friend Linda
fit me into Dr. Weitz's schedule.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.494
She even coded it to Julian's insurance.

25:36.576 --> 25:38.037
How did you ever convince her to...

25:38.120 --> 25:39.621
I was nice to her, okay?

25:39.705 --> 25:41.748
Are you happy? I was nice.

25:41.832 --> 25:43.792
And I learned it from watching you.

25:45.585 --> 25:46.688
And that's why I got you something

25:46.712 --> 25:48.714
from Dr. Weitz's toy chest.

25:52.468 --> 25:54.803
Stretchy sticky hand! Sweet!

25:54.887 --> 25:57.473
I'm gonna throw it against stuff
till it loses its stick

25:57.555 --> 25:59.225
'cause of hair.

25:59.308 --> 26:02.520
Kimmy, I will try to appreciate you more.

26:02.602 --> 26:06.065
For example, I love how your hair
matches your gums.

26:07.149 --> 26:12.488
But I understand if you don't want
to work for me anymore.

26:12.570 --> 26:16.075
Actually, Ms. White,
I don't want to work for you anymore.

26:16.158 --> 26:19.245
'Cause I want to go back
to just being your friend.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.998
Because you actually
taught me something too.

26:23.082 --> 26:25.334
Are you gonna steal my look?

26:25.418 --> 26:27.687
You've taught me that it's okay
to ask your friends for help,

26:27.711 --> 26:29.422
even if it might be a pain in their rear.

26:29.505 --> 26:31.382
'Splain it.

26:31.465 --> 26:34.427
I promise to help you with whatever
you need whenever you need it,

26:34.510 --> 26:37.346
if you let me borrow your car
in between times.

26:37.430 --> 26:40.349
'Cause you're looking
at a fudging Uber driver.

26:40.433 --> 26:42.976
They gave me a phone.

26:43.060 --> 26:44.562
I've got two phones now.

26:44.644 --> 26:47.064
I can call my other ear.

26:47.856 --> 26:49.607
I'm really happy for you.

26:49.691 --> 26:50.776
Thanks, Ms. White.

26:50.859 --> 26:52.403
No.

26:52.486 --> 26:54.905
Kimmy, Ms. Jacqueline.
