00:35.660 --> 00:37.787

00:37.871 --> 00:39.706
-My dad said I could stay the night.
-[sighs]

00:39.789 --> 00:42.292
Look, based off that question,
that's news to you.

00:43.418 --> 00:44.919
I don't have time for this.

00:45.003 --> 00:46.421
Can I have my blanket back?

00:46.504 --> 00:47.422
Your blanket?

00:52.052 --> 00:55.346
Why didn't you tell me
Kelvin was staying here again last night?

00:56.056 --> 00:58.266
Well, you made it clear
when you keyed my car,

00:58.349 --> 01:00.310
that you knew everything that I do.

01:00.393 --> 01:02.228
But if you want to key his bike,

01:02.312 --> 01:03.271
it's out back too.

01:05.190 --> 01:06.733
That was a week ago.

01:06.816 --> 01:08.651
I said I'm sorry.

01:09.235 --> 01:10.445
That was once.

01:10.528 --> 01:13.531
I'm gonna need more sorrys,
man, before I get done with it.

01:13.615 --> 01:17.535
[sighs] Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:17.619 --> 01:18.745
When is he going home?

01:20.413 --> 01:22.499
Hey, Kelvin ain't here that much, Regina.

01:22.582 --> 01:25.627
It's been three nights this week, Bennie.

01:26.419 --> 01:28.588
[exhales] I'm happy to have the kid here.

01:28.671 --> 01:29.839
-All right?
-All right.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.591
But Tasha's taking advantage.

01:31.674 --> 01:34.511
She can't drop him off
anytime she wanna run the streets.

01:34.594 --> 01:36.513
Well, you know how Tasha is.

01:36.596 --> 01:40.100
She's wild and,
you know, Tasha's still young.

01:41.059 --> 01:42.102
And I'm not?

01:42.685 --> 01:46.147
I'm not saying you're not still young,
but she's younger than you.

01:49.692 --> 01:53.071
There's a whole other side
to that Camaro that I didn't key.

Look, you right, baby,
and I'm wrong. Okay?

01:57.408 --> 01:59.536
I'll talk to old-ass Tasha.

Uh-uh. Kelvin is still on the couch, man.

Come on.
Now, I told you, I got my GMAT today.

02:07.710 --> 02:09.587
I can't have extra noise around here.

02:09.671 --> 02:12.382
You know I need it quiet,
Bennie, when I take my test.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.968
That's what they made headphones for.

02:15.718 --> 02:18.388

they're gonna let you take it online.

02:18.972 --> 02:19.806

02:21.432 --> 02:24.727
I, for one, would prefer
to pass on my own merits.

02:26.146 --> 02:29.065
Besides, they got
a proctor watching so I can't cheat.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.568
You know what, sweetheart?
That's a you problem.

02:31.651 --> 02:34.904
You know? Yeah.
Handle it like you handled my car.

-Oh, come…

10:46.687 --> 10:48.564
You'll be what they call "out of a job"

10:48.648 --> 10:50.650
if you don't find
nowhere to put them rags.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.903
That tone's not gonna
make the work go faster.

10:54.487 --> 10:55.404
[Tasha] Bennie!

10:55.488 --> 10:56.906
Get your ass out here!

10:56.989 --> 10:59.450
Duck, light the rags and throw 'em at me.

10:59.533 --> 11:01.494
Oh, so now you want the rags?

11:03.954 --> 11:05.790
Don't call me like I got a warrant.

11:05.873 --> 11:07.124
What are you doing here?

11:07.208 --> 11:08.459
I got your text.

11:08.542 --> 11:11.003
Why you taking my stuff?
This ain't no swap meet.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.255
Consider it child support.

11:13.339 --> 11:15.132
But also I want my child support.

11:15.216 --> 11:17.885
Do y'all got toilet paper in the back?
I like one-ply.

11:19.011 --> 11:21.806
Stop taking my stuff, you project pirate.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.935
You the one who said we needed to talk.

11:26.018 --> 11:29.021
Yeah, that mean call.
Don't come by my job.

11:29.105 --> 11:31.482
You've been leaving Kelvin
at my house too much.

11:31.565 --> 11:34.694
Oh, I'm sorry, Kelvin's daddy.

11:34.777 --> 11:38.948
Don't do that 'cause it's
a pleasure for me to have him,

11:39.031 --> 11:40.199
but you can't leave him

11:40.282 --> 11:44.120
every time you want to run around
with every Tom, Dick and Hobo.

11:45.955 --> 11:48.416
Well, you could've
just told me that in a text.

11:49.542 --> 11:50.418
I'mma kill you.

11:53.713 --> 11:56.507
Look, not that it's any of your business,

11:57.425 --> 12:02.012
but I happen to be in a relationship
with a very good man, thank you very much.

12:02.096 --> 12:02.930
Oh, yeah?

12:03.514 --> 12:04.515
He got a Lexus.

12:04.598 --> 12:06.225
[cheers]

12:06.308 --> 12:07.852
A car. Not a daughter.

12:07.935 --> 12:10.020
[excited grunting]

12:10.104 --> 12:11.564
[cheers]

12:11.647 --> 12:13.107
Can he pay my child support?

12:13.941 --> 12:15.192
You know what? [clears throat]

12:15.276 --> 12:16.652
My bag full.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.155
Um… Kelvin! Let's go! I'm thawing meat!

12:20.990 --> 12:23.200
Kelvin's not here. He's at my house.

12:23.284 --> 12:26.871
Oh! So you can leave him
at your house, but I can't?

12:28.414 --> 12:30.332
[instrumental music playing]

12:31.459 --> 12:32.626
Find anything?

12:33.377 --> 12:36.088
A couple of rat traps.
This might solve itself.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.007
[groans] I hate rats.

12:38.090 --> 12:39.759
You just full of fears today.

12:40.342 --> 12:41.719
He's not in the driveway.

12:41.802 --> 12:43.554
But I saw the cutest squirrel.

12:44.054 --> 12:44.889
Can I keep him?

12:44.972 --> 12:46.557
Uh-uh. Squirrels carry rabies.

12:46.640 --> 12:48.684
How are you more popular than me?

12:48.768 --> 12:50.770
I don't question it. I just enjoy it.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.104
[Regina] Oof.

12:52.188 --> 12:55.441
This test has more parts
than an '80s R & B group.

12:56.025 --> 12:58.235
Why are you on my chair?

12:58.319 --> 13:00.446
Yeah, Kelvin. The game's over. Move on.

13:02.239 --> 13:04.408
Why are you down here around people?

13:04.492 --> 13:06.243
With your ankles all exposed?

13:07.077 --> 13:08.078
Water break.

13:08.913 --> 13:12.124
How many breaks do they give you,
and can we get the schedule?

13:19.215 --> 13:21.592
Okay, why are you being all weird?

13:21.675 --> 13:22.802
'Cause that's my move.

13:23.928 --> 13:28.516
If you want to spoil the surprise,
we were making you a cake to celebrate.

13:28.599 --> 13:31.727
That's why he's on the chair.
He's going to put his foot in it.

13:33.979 --> 13:37.149
Aw, you guys. A cake? Aw!

13:37.233 --> 13:39.735
Well, the sprinkles
are up in the top cabinet.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.946
Yeah. Got it. Get the hell out of here.

13:46.242 --> 13:47.952
Dang it. Now we gotta bake a cake.

13:48.035 --> 13:50.871
[clattering]

13:50.955 --> 13:54.458
There he is again.
This scratchy bastard is under the sink.

13:54.542 --> 13:55.459
Let me go up!

13:56.544 --> 13:59.213
He might be slippery.
Maybe we just need to stun him.

13:59.296 --> 14:00.840
Don't hurt him!

14:00.923 --> 14:02.591
It's okay. She'll be very gentle.

14:03.384 --> 14:04.718
But maybe close your eyes.

14:04.802 --> 14:07.555
Ooh. You in trouble now.
That's your ass, dragon.

14:08.138 --> 14:10.182
Oh, yeah. You all man from up there, huh?

14:10.933 --> 14:12.059
I see him!

14:13.269 --> 14:14.645
I think he got away.

14:14.728 --> 14:17.356
Something's on me. Why am I wet?

14:17.439 --> 14:19.316
[buzzing]

14:24.113 --> 14:25.531
[water spraying]

14:25.614 --> 14:28.868
-What did you just do?
-I thought maybe I could drown him?

14:28.951 --> 14:29.994
Turn the thingy off!

14:30.077 --> 14:32.204
-What's the thingy?
-You know! The thingy!

14:34.623 --> 14:37.334
Hey, we got… What the…
What's going on with the sink?

14:37.418 --> 14:40.170
-Y'all didn't turn off the valve?
-That's a real word!

14:40.254 --> 14:41.630
And no.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.382
My dragon broke the sink!

14:43.465 --> 14:45.009
Sure it did, baby. Auntie!

14:45.092 --> 14:47.344
You heard the girl!
Her dragon broke the sink!

14:47.428 --> 14:50.306
-That's a real thing?
-It's a very real thing!

14:50.389 --> 14:51.682
[valve squeaking, turns off]

14:51.765 --> 14:54.810
I gotta get this dude out of here.
I'll take him to the shop.

14:54.894 --> 14:58.564
Fix the sink, find the lizard
and nobody bothers your mother

14:58.647 --> 15:00.107
until she finishes that test.

15:00.774 --> 15:01.734
Come on. Let's go.

15:01.817 --> 15:02.735
[Kelvin grunts]

15:03.569 --> 15:04.987
I can't get my shoes wet.

15:10.492 --> 15:11.327
Let's go!

15:13.829 --> 15:15.456
Is the squirrel still out there?

15:15.539 --> 15:17.625
[instrumental music playing]

15:20.878 --> 15:24.173
Rags are gone. Don't ask how.
Just say a prayer for the planet.

15:24.715 --> 15:25.758
And my soul.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.011
Guys. It's going down.

15:29.094 --> 15:32.806
Got off the phone with my boy Left Leg.
Inspector's in the neighborhood.

15:32.890 --> 15:35.768
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
he'll stop at the porn shop first.

15:35.851 --> 15:38.437
He better not.
Otherwise, he gonna find them rags.

15:40.439 --> 15:42.024
-All right, we good.
-Okay.

15:42.107 --> 15:43.692
We've been working all morning.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.736
-This place is tight, baby.
-Yeah.

15:45.819 --> 15:48.530
-Promise me there's no dragons in here!
-What?

15:48.614 --> 15:50.741
Look. Hey, man. Where are you coming from?

15:50.824 --> 15:52.576
Uh… You been in my stash?

15:52.660 --> 15:54.286
He ain't high. He's just a mess.

15:54.870 --> 15:57.331
I need some Takis
and a root beer to calm me down.

15:59.333 --> 16:02.211
Thanks to you, the house is in chaos.

16:02.294 --> 16:05.005
Why did you let baby girl
bring home a bearded dragon?

16:05.089 --> 16:07.883
That was real?
I thought she was talking about you.

16:08.968 --> 16:09.802
I didn't know.

16:10.928 --> 16:13.055
Well, it's ruining Regina's test.

16:13.138 --> 16:15.349
I'm pretty sure
you and Regina can handle it.

16:15.933 --> 16:17.643
Y'all handled my car pretty good.

16:18.227 --> 16:19.728
Ghetto-ass Wonder Twins.

16:19.812 --> 16:20.896
Deactivate.

16:21.522 --> 16:23.983
When are you going to shut up about that?

16:24.066 --> 16:27.277
All the shit you do to Regina,
she can't make one mistake?

16:27.361 --> 16:29.947
No, 'cause every time
I make "one mistake,"

16:30.030 --> 16:31.615
y'all run it in the ground.

16:31.699 --> 16:33.826
You know what? Pfft.
Let me get back to the house

16:33.909 --> 16:36.620
so I can make sure
Regina gets a high enough score

16:36.704 --> 16:39.999
to get into grad school,
meet someone on her level

16:40.082 --> 16:42.209
and finally dump your ass.

16:42.292 --> 16:43.460
[grunts]

16:43.544 --> 16:45.838
Get your dumpy ass out of here

16:45.921 --> 16:47.548
and take Kelvin with you.

16:47.631 --> 16:49.299
He can't be here today.

16:49.383 --> 16:51.927
'Cause today, we got an inspection.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.012
An inspection?

16:53.095 --> 16:56.432
Oh, damn. When it rains it pours.

16:56.515 --> 16:59.476
You know what, your son, your problem.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.437
My sister, my problem.

17:07.067 --> 17:08.694
And why is that outlet smoking?

17:09.695 --> 17:11.280
Your face makes it nervous.

17:12.281 --> 17:15.909
[instrumental music playing]

17:15.993 --> 17:17.870
Okay. I stopped the water for now,

17:17.953 --> 17:19.955
but we need a real plumber or an ark.

17:20.456 --> 17:24.084
We're cleaning as much as we can.
The other towels are in Mama's bathroom.

17:24.752 --> 17:27.171
-How's it going?
-I think we're doing a good job.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.882
[groans] Shit!

17:30.507 --> 17:32.176
I think we missed a spot.

17:32.259 --> 17:34.178
-[Bernard] Auntie, are you okay?
-Are you okay?

17:34.261 --> 17:36.346
-Nobody touch me.
-You could have a concussion.

17:36.430 --> 17:38.515
[groans] I'm KO.

17:39.099 --> 17:41.060
We have to at least elevate your head.

17:41.143 --> 17:42.436
Girls, go get a pillow.

17:42.519 --> 17:46.190
If we make her too comfortable,
she might fall asleep and that's not good.

17:46.273 --> 17:49.526
-Fine, get her a book.
-What do you like, romance or mystery?

17:50.235 --> 17:52.446
-For her head!
-Oh!

17:53.447 --> 17:55.991
-This is kind of fun. [chuckles]
-Really? You're having fun?

17:56.075 --> 17:57.326
Yeah.

17:57.409 --> 18:00.120
Auntie, did you hear that?
She's having fun with me.

18:00.204 --> 18:01.538
Best day ever.

18:03.916 --> 18:07.127
Go check on your mother.
Make sure she didn't hear anything.

18:07.211 --> 18:09.171
I did not fall gracefully.

18:09.254 --> 18:10.839
I'm sorry. Are you okay, Auntie?

18:10.923 --> 18:12.132
-Just go.
-[sighs]

18:15.552 --> 18:17.930
Oh, man. What a day.

18:18.847 --> 18:20.849
I'm supposed to be drunk at mini-golf.

18:22.976 --> 18:24.603
[rustling]

18:29.691 --> 18:31.026
He's in here!

18:41.870 --> 18:43.455
Oh, hell no.

18:47.751 --> 18:49.670
Hey, Ma. What you hear?

18:50.921 --> 18:52.172
You breathing hard.

18:53.757 --> 18:55.425
Why you creeping outside my door?

18:56.009 --> 18:59.221
I was saying a prayer
that you pass your test.

18:59.805 --> 19:03.308
Just came upstairs
so I'd be closer to God.

19:03.392 --> 19:04.226
Amen.

19:05.352 --> 19:06.186
Well…

19:07.437 --> 19:09.398
[sighs] He heard you 'cause I passed.

19:09.481 --> 19:10.983
-You passed?
-I passed!

19:11.900 --> 19:13.694
We good! She passed!

19:13.777 --> 19:15.988
Okay, Ma. Look, now, don't freak out,

19:16.071 --> 19:19.241
but Aunt Lucretia's in the kitchen,
but she says she's fine.

19:19.825 --> 19:23.120
Oh, my God. Lucretia!
What happened? Why is she on the floor?

19:23.203 --> 19:24.371
That's where she fell.

19:25.914 --> 19:27.124
Did you crush it?

19:27.207 --> 19:29.626
What? Yeah, but we ain't on that.

19:29.710 --> 19:30.878
No more GMAT?

19:30.961 --> 19:31.837
No.

19:32.421 --> 19:33.881
Good. Get your phone.

19:34.506 --> 19:37.050
You need a plumber and I need a CAT scan.

19:37.801 --> 19:39.303
I found him!

19:39.386 --> 19:40.804
[screams]

19:41.513 --> 19:42.598
[Lucretia groans]

19:42.681 --> 19:44.266
Not my good leg.

19:45.142 --> 19:47.811
[instrumental music playing]

19:47.895 --> 19:51.148
-Hey, Kelvin.
-I didn't know you were picking me up.

19:51.231 --> 19:53.775
Your mom's running late
and asked me to swing by.

19:53.859 --> 19:56.236
Hey, any chance
I can drive your Lexus again?

19:56.320 --> 19:58.989
-You gonna wait for me to get in?
-I circled back for you.

19:59.072 --> 20:01.283
Oh, you circled back for me.
That's what you did, huh?

20:01.366 --> 20:02.659
-Your dad in there?
-Yeah.

20:02.743 --> 20:04.870
-Let me tell him we're leaving.
-All right.

20:05.954 --> 20:07.664
Which one of you is Bennie Upshaw?

20:07.748 --> 20:09.249
Oh, that'd be me. Oh!

20:10.417 --> 20:12.127
This is my place. Yeah.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.629
Good to meet you. Noah Yang.

20:13.712 --> 20:15.255
Hey. How you doing?

20:15.797 --> 20:17.007
Uh…

20:17.090 --> 20:19.009
I mean, I been waiting on you all day.

20:19.092 --> 20:19.927
Anything?

20:20.010 --> 20:21.887
You wanna check out the bathroom? Or…

20:21.970 --> 20:23.805
-No, I'm good.
-Okay. Yeah.

20:23.889 --> 20:27.184
And as you saw,
I got my chairs all lined up.

20:27.267 --> 20:29.728
Then freshened up my magazines.

20:29.811 --> 20:31.772
And it's smelling good in there.

20:31.855 --> 20:34.399
Yeah. Seems like a really nice place.

20:34.483 --> 20:36.944
Yeah. That was easy.
I was about to bribe you.

20:37.027 --> 20:38.195
No, I'm just kidding.

20:38.695 --> 20:40.239
Uh, unless you want me to.

20:41.823 --> 20:44.409
Well, I guess
I can stop pretending to smoke.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.287
And I can go get those oily rags back.

20:47.371 --> 20:48.997
[siren blaring]

20:49.081 --> 20:49.998
Oh, Lord.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.541
The porn shop's on fire.

20:53.210 --> 20:54.127
Man.

20:54.211 --> 20:56.755
Guess I don't
have to return those tapes I rented.

20:56.838 --> 20:59.675
You still renting porn in 2021?

20:59.758 --> 21:01.718
My girl checks my browser history.

21:02.219 --> 21:04.346
I'm sorry.
I'm just here to pick up Kelvin.

21:04.429 --> 21:08.016
What are you doing with Kelvin?
What part of the inspection is that?

21:08.600 --> 21:12.646
Ah. I think there's some confusion.
I should have introduced myself better.

21:13.146 --> 21:16.233
I'm Tasha's boyfriend. Noah.
She asked me to pick Kelvin up.

21:17.067 --> 21:18.193
She's using you.

21:20.404 --> 21:22.155
Hey, Noah. I got my stuff.

21:22.239 --> 21:23.824
Kelvin, you know this dude?

21:23.907 --> 21:25.617
This my mom's boyfriend.

21:25.701 --> 21:27.953
Why is your mom's boyfriend
picking you up?

21:28.036 --> 21:29.746
Because Mama got time issues.

21:29.830 --> 21:31.248
Yes, she does.

21:32.499 --> 21:34.084
Y'all got inside jokes?

21:34.626 --> 21:36.795
Yeah, well, since you driving him,

21:36.878 --> 21:38.463
make sure he's in a car seat.

21:39.840 --> 21:40.882
He's a teenager.

21:40.966 --> 21:44.177
Yeah, I know.
We got inside jokes. Right, son?

21:44.261 --> 21:45.971
We've never done that, ever.

21:46.054 --> 21:48.307
Yeah, okay, well, we doing it now, okay?

21:48.932 --> 21:50.142
Laugh, son.

21:50.726 --> 21:51.560
Laugh.

21:51.643 --> 21:54.813
Well, I'm parked
really close to that porn fire.

21:54.896 --> 21:57.232
So, if we're cool here,
we should head out.

21:58.025 --> 21:59.067
You cool, Kelvin?

21:59.151 --> 22:00.736
Yeah. I'll see you later.

22:00.819 --> 22:02.988
Hey, you want to stop by our burger place?

22:03.071 --> 22:04.906
-Chili cheese time?
-Yes, sir. Come on.

22:04.990 --> 22:05.824
[both] Boom!

22:08.368 --> 22:10.370
Make sure you're wearing your seat belt!

22:11.079 --> 22:12.497
It's your father talking!

22:13.290 --> 22:14.541
I'm your father!

22:16.543 --> 22:18.128
They got a boop and everything.

22:18.211 --> 22:19.087
You see that?

22:19.171 --> 22:20.589
That's good to see, man.

22:20.672 --> 22:22.966
A boy needs a good role model in his life.

22:24.593 --> 22:27.095
Shut up, Davis,
with your terrible-ass life.

22:28.430 --> 22:30.432
-And this raggedy-ass car!
-Hey!

22:32.684 --> 22:34.269
Oh, man! Look what you did!

22:34.353 --> 22:35.896
[groaning]

22:35.979 --> 22:36.813
Damn!

22:36.897 --> 22:39.066
[groaning] Damn!

22:39.149 --> 22:41.485
INSafe! Surprise inspection time.

22:41.568 --> 22:42.611
Ain't that a bitch?

22:42.694 --> 22:43.653
Oh, my knee!

22:43.737 --> 22:44.988
Oh, my back!

22:45.072 --> 22:46.448
Oh, my knee and my back!

22:47.908 --> 22:50.327
Nothing wrong with this outlet.
I'm just smoking.

22:51.453 --> 22:53.413
Smoking in a garage,

22:53.497 --> 22:55.165
faulty outlet

22:55.248 --> 22:57.626
and that man's making oil angels.

22:57.709 --> 22:59.336
No, I'm trying to get up!

23:02.672 --> 23:04.549
You all fail on many levels.

23:05.967 --> 23:07.511
Is it too late to bribe you?

23:09.262 --> 23:10.180
[groans]

23:10.263 --> 23:12.265
