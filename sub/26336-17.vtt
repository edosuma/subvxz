Morning, gentlemen.

01:17.978 --> 01:19.212
Uh-huh.

01:19.245 --> 01:21.281
Uh, this is, uh, Nick.

01:23.716 --> 01:26.186
Well, its nice
to see a fresh face.

01:26.218 --> 01:27.219
No offense, Carl.

01:28.221 --> 01:30.222
Well, I got to say,

01:30.256 --> 01:31.724
you're lucky to have
this guy as a partner.

01:31.757 --> 01:33.859
Carl has seen it all.

01:33.893 --> 01:35.295
Haven't you?

01:41.634 --> 01:42.868
Carl?

01:42.902 --> 01:44.370
Everything okay?

01:44.403 --> 01:46.206
Im sorry.

01:51.343 --> 01:52.378
Dont do it!

01:52.412 --> 01:54.480
Open it up!

01:54.514 --> 01:55.914
This is a robbery!

01:55.948 --> 01:58.617
Everybody stay calm
and nobody gets hurt.

01:58.651 --> 02:00.653
Come on. Quickly.

02:02.355 --> 02:03.656
Nobody needs to die today.

02:03.689 --> 02:05.825
Hey, yall think
this a game, huh?

02:09.262 --> 02:10.663
Open it up!

02:10.697 --> 02:12.699
Open it up!

02:12.731 --> 02:14.334
Open the door...

02:14.366 --> 02:15.668
or Im going to kill you.

02:18.003 --> 02:19.038
Head down!

02:19.072 --> 02:22.542
Start moving your way
to the center of the bank.

02:22.574 --> 02:24.210
Get off the door!

02:24.243 --> 02:26.211
Get to the center.

02:26.246 --> 02:27.813
Look at the floor.

02:27.847 --> 02:29.983
No heroes, no problems.
Got it?

02:30.015 --> 02:31.584
We have a 0-3-0.

02:31.617 --> 02:32.985
Armed robbery in progress
at Bank of Oahu.

02:33.019 --> 02:34.753
1147 Kuhio Avenue.

02:34.787 --> 02:35.989
Calls out. Three minutes.

02:36.021 --> 02:36.939
Three minutes.

02:36.940 --> 02:37.856
Three minutes.

02:38.790 --> 02:40.727
There you go.

02:42.395 --> 02:43.496
Thank you.

02:43.530 --> 02:45.230
Whoa!

02:47.400 --> 02:48.501
Do we have a problem?

02:48.502 --> 02:49.602
Damn it, Nick.

02:49.635 --> 02:51.503
Nose to the floor.

02:56.876 --> 02:59.846
Head down! Unless you want
me to blow it off.

02:59.878 --> 03:02.014
Yo, what the hell was that?

03:02.048 --> 03:04.317
What? He was
giving me trouble.

03:07.453 --> 03:09.955
Face down, nose to the floor.

03:15.328 --> 03:17.296
Were almost out of here.

03:17.329 --> 03:18.463
Real good, real good.

03:25.371 --> 03:26.506
Come on.

03:27.539 --> 03:28.974
Lets go, kids.
Grab those doors.

03:37.383 --> 03:38.518
Lets go.

03:46.825 --> 03:47.961
Lets run.

03:47.993 --> 03:49.361
Nobody move!

03:49.395 --> 03:51.296
Nobody move!

03:51.331 --> 03:53.466
Lets go.

04:35.375 --> 04:36.808
Yeah, we got to try

05:55.620 --> 05:56.755
Yo.

05:56.788 --> 05:58.757
Hey, we know if this
is the same crew

05:58.790 --> 06:01.127
that hit the Union
Liberty Bank last week?

06:01.160 --> 06:02.795
Not unless they changed
their MO.

06:02.829 --> 06:05.497
That crew took 30 grand
from the tellers drawer.

06:05.531 --> 06:07.533
These guys came in
and cleaned out the vaults

06:07.567 --> 06:08.518
to the tune
of $2.6 million.

06:08.519 --> 06:09.468
Whoa.

06:09.502 --> 06:10.802
$2.6 million?

06:10.836 --> 06:12.137
Banks don't carry
that kind of cash,

06:12.170 --> 06:13.639
they got a couple
hundred grand, tops.

06:13.673 --> 06:15.208
Yeah, well, this
just so happened to be

06:15.240 --> 06:16.742
the day where the bank was

06:16.776 --> 06:18.211
completely flushed with cash.

06:20.545 --> 06:23.449
Yeah, these guys clearly
had inside information.

06:23.483 --> 06:25.084
Oh, that aint the half of it.

06:25.117 --> 06:26.752
Wait till you see how
they pulled this thing off.

06:26.786 --> 06:28.687
Come with me.

06:28.721 --> 06:29.822
...and after
I heard the gunshots,

06:29.855 --> 06:31.524
I didn't want
to take any chances.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.826
Oh, Miss Lee, this is my partner...
Junior.

06:33.860 --> 06:35.595
Hey, Jenny. Hey.
Hey. Hi.

06:37.028 --> 06:38.497
You okay?
Yeah, just...

06:38.531 --> 06:39.831
shaken up, you know?
Okay. Take a seat.

06:39.865 --> 06:41.500
Jenny, shes an
old friend of mine.

06:41.533 --> 06:43.168
She was next door neighbors
with my cousin.

06:43.201 --> 06:45.838
And I saw her all
the time growing up.

06:45.872 --> 06:48.007
Wow, well, Im sorry we
have to meet like this.

06:48.040 --> 06:49.141
Jenny, is there anything else

06:49.175 --> 06:51.711
that you could tell us
about the people who did this?

06:51.744 --> 06:54.680
Sorry, but it all
happened so fast, and...

06:54.713 --> 06:57.115
my head was down the whole time.

06:57.149 --> 06:59.519
I wish I could be more helpful.

06:59.552 --> 07:01.019
<i>Okay, so,</i>

07:01.052 --> 07:02.254
the partners
the inside man, right?

07:02.288 --> 07:04.257
Teams up with this crew,
pulls off the job?

07:04.290 --> 07:06.192
Close but not quite.

07:06.225 --> 07:09.161
This is the person Carl Norris
walked into the bank with.

07:09.194 --> 07:11.630
But I reached out
to the armored truck company

07:11.663 --> 07:13.766
and according to them,
the second guard assigned

07:13.800 --> 07:15.535
to todays run was this guy.

07:16.601 --> 07:17.569
Nohea Kepule.

07:17.603 --> 07:19.071
Norriss usual partner.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.740
They were seen leaving
the armored truck facility

07:21.774 --> 07:24.209
this morning at 7:30 together.

07:24.242 --> 07:26.646
This heist crew,
they jack the truck, right?

07:26.678 --> 07:27.947
Somewhere along the route.

07:27.980 --> 07:29.815
And they switch out
their guy for Kepule.

07:29.848 --> 07:31.750
Except it looks like
they had their own truck.

07:31.783 --> 07:33.052
According to HPD,

07:33.084 --> 07:34.887
the vehicle the crew
were driving was packing

07:34.920 --> 07:36.689
enough horsepower
to blow through

07:36.721 --> 07:38.757
a police roadblock
and evade pursuit.

07:38.790 --> 07:41.226
They had also fitted run-flat
tires and bullet-proof glass.

07:41.259 --> 07:43.930
Im thinking they modified
an identical vehicle

07:43.963 --> 07:45.064
to match the companys
armored truck.

07:45.096 --> 07:46.231
These armored truck companies

07:46.264 --> 07:48.000
outfit all of their trucks
with GPS.

07:55.641 --> 07:57.108
I have visual on the van.

07:58.644 --> 07:59.911
Moving.

07:59.946 --> 08:02.581
Guys, theres someone
in the truck.

08:07.887 --> 08:09.021
He's alive.

08:19.031 --> 08:20.332
<i>For real. Level with me.</i>

08:20.365 --> 08:21.600
<i>- Mm-hmm.
- And does it sound like...</i>

08:21.634 --> 08:23.286
Its

08:23.287 --> 08:24.937
<i>over</i>

08:21.634 --> 08:24.937
over, or it sound
like I can get her back?

08:24.971 --> 08:26.271
Well, it depends.

08:26.305 --> 08:27.939
Did she get a new haircut yet?

08:27.973 --> 08:29.809
Uh, yeah, actually.
Last week.

08:29.841 --> 08:31.209
Hell...

08:31.244 --> 08:32.778
Sorry, it-its definitely over.

08:32.812 --> 08:34.813
Why do you say that?

08:34.846 --> 08:36.215
- What does that have to do with anything?
- Because, dude,

08:36.249 --> 08:37.850
When a woman gets a haircut

08:37.884 --> 08:39.719
after a breakup...

08:39.751 --> 08:41.019
that's it;
shes done.

08:41.052 --> 08:43.221
Shes hit the reset button, okay?

08:43.255 --> 08:45.024
Best you can do
is forget about her

08:45.057 --> 08:47.025
and move on.

08:47.058 --> 08:49.828
Just take it from a guy
whos been married 20 years.

08:49.861 --> 08:52.197
All right?
Never take them at face value.

08:52.230 --> 08:55.368
Theres always something
more complicated going on.

08:55.400 --> 08:57.036
Hi, honey.

08:57.068 --> 08:59.672
Oh, your ears must be burning.

09:02.307 --> 09:04.043
Okay.

09:05.144 --> 09:06.913
I understand.

09:12.250 --> 09:14.886
Everything okay, brah?

09:15.988 --> 09:17.722
Uh, uh, take this left up here.

09:17.756 --> 09:19.958
What you mean, take this left?

09:19.991 --> 09:21.961
You know route, man, I...
Just do it!

09:21.994 --> 09:23.446
Are you crazy?

09:23.447 --> 09:24.897
Im so sorry.

09:33.706 --> 09:35.774
And that's the last thing
I remember.

09:35.807 --> 09:38.344
When I came to,
my head was pounding.

09:38.376 --> 09:40.779
Carl was gone.

09:40.812 --> 09:41.846
That's it.

09:41.880 --> 09:43.182
Thank you.
Thank you.

09:43.215 --> 09:45.150
All right, thank you, guys.

09:45.183 --> 09:46.686
Wait, wait, wait.

09:46.719 --> 09:47.919
Is he okay?

09:47.953 --> 09:49.688
What happened?

09:49.721 --> 09:51.823
Im sorry, uh,
Carl didn't make it.

09:51.856 --> 09:53.725
Were really sorry.

09:53.759 --> 09:56.729
Thanks for your help.
Well be in touch, okay?

10:00.198 --> 10:02.100
Okay, so right before
this guy goes postal,

10:02.134 --> 10:03.936
pulls a gun on his
partner, he gets

10:03.970 --> 10:06.839
a phone call from his wife.
They were using her to leverage Carl

10:06.871 --> 10:08.106
into doing this.

10:08.139 --> 10:08.990
We got a home address?

10:08.991 --> 10:09.841
Yeah.

10:09.875 --> 10:11.210
In Kaimuki.

10:31.797 --> 10:32.965
This doesn't look great.

10:46.011 --> 10:48.880
He's one of our heist crew.

10:48.913 --> 10:51.750
Stab wound to the carotid.
Mustve bled out in minutes.

10:51.783 --> 10:52.884
That's great.

10:52.918 --> 10:54.419
Who did it?

11:22.081 --> 11:23.783
The wifes injuries are minor.
Shes still in shock,

11:23.816 --> 11:24.817
so they're taking her
to the hospital.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.052
Its probably gonna be a minute

11:26.085 --> 11:27.919
before we get a statement
out of her.

11:27.952 --> 11:29.989
Okay, well, in the meantime,
we got an ID

11:30.022 --> 11:32.524
on the dead guy you found.
Names Milo Harris,

11:32.557 --> 11:36.861
and, unsurprisingly,
he's got a long list of priors.

11:36.895 --> 11:39.065
In fact, he just got out
of Halawa three weeks ago.

11:39.097 --> 11:40.865
All right, look, lets dig
into his known associates,

11:40.899 --> 11:41.801
hopefully thatll help lead us

11:41.834 --> 11:43.235
to the other members
of this heist crew,

11:43.269 --> 11:44.537
and in the meantime,
dump his phone.

11:44.570 --> 11:46.105
Okay?
All right, Ill keep you posted.

11:46.138 --> 11:49.408
Well, I have to cancel
my 5:00 p.m. mermaid class.

11:49.442 --> 11:51.543
This case isnt getting
closed anytime soon.

11:51.576 --> 11:53.546
Whatre you doing?

11:53.578 --> 11:55.815
Im just scrubbing through
footage from the robbery.

12:01.052 --> 12:02.187
Isnt that your friend, Jenny?

12:02.221 --> 12:04.923
Yup, and check this out.

12:04.956 --> 12:07.359
She was so adamant
about the fact

12:07.393 --> 12:08.894
she hadn't seen anything.

12:08.927 --> 12:11.096
She said her head was
down the entire time.

12:11.129 --> 12:13.466
Exactly. So why would
she be lying?

12:13.499 --> 12:15.900
Okay, so,

12:15.934 --> 12:18.504
maybe I did lift my head
at one point,

12:18.537 --> 12:20.338
but you have to understand,

12:20.371 --> 12:22.908
it all happened so quickly
and I was terrified.

12:22.942 --> 12:24.844
I guess I just didn't remember.

12:24.876 --> 12:28.013
We-we do understand.
We do. You were scared.

12:28.047 --> 12:30.381
Adrenaline was pumping,
the details are probably fuzzy.

12:31.450 --> 12:33.119
Or...

12:33.152 --> 12:34.385
maybe it was because

12:34.419 --> 12:35.386
you were scared
of what these people

12:35.421 --> 12:37.523
might do to you if they
found out that you were

12:37.556 --> 12:39.225
talking to the cops.

12:39.258 --> 12:41.226
Jenny, if you're worried
about your safety,

12:41.259 --> 12:42.461
our job is to protect you.

12:42.495 --> 12:45.530
Okay? But you just have to tell
us exactly what happened.

12:45.563 --> 12:47.500
Hey, its okay.

12:47.533 --> 12:49.534
Its okay.

12:51.302 --> 12:54.405
I don't know if it was
the sound of his voice,

12:54.440 --> 12:57.576
but I instantly recognized him.

12:57.610 --> 13:00.178
And I knew that
if I was right...

13:02.514 --> 13:05.518
...then he probably
recognized me, which meant

13:05.551 --> 13:09.488
he could come after me.
Come after my family.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.956
No. Hey, Jenny, look.

13:11.990 --> 13:14.058
I won't let that happen.
I promise you.

13:18.163 --> 13:19.965
It was Tory.

13:19.999 --> 13:22.000
Tory Laeha.

13:24.403 --> 13:25.538
You sure?

13:25.571 --> 13:26.504
Yes.

13:26.538 --> 13:27.873
His eyes,

13:27.907 --> 13:30.176
his voice, his build.

13:30.208 --> 13:32.544
Im 99% sure it was him.

13:32.577 --> 13:36.514
Tory Laeha is Laylas boyfriend.

13:36.548 --> 13:37.917
Your ex Layla?

13:37.950 --> 13:40.451
Yeah.

14:01.941 --> 14:03.676
Pick up that phone

14:03.708 --> 14:06.010
and call your husband, now.

14:09.948 --> 14:12.017
Give me the phone.

14:13.952 --> 14:15.187
Hi, honey.

14:15.221 --> 14:16.922
Oh, your ears must be burning.

14:16.956 --> 14:19.924
Listen very carefully
and don't say a word.

14:19.958 --> 14:21.527
We have your wife.

14:21.559 --> 14:25.063
Did he say anything else
during that time?

14:25.096 --> 14:27.198
Anything else that
might help us?

14:27.232 --> 14:30.568
I-I remember...

14:30.602 --> 14:33.371
he said on the phone,

14:33.404 --> 14:34.706
before he hung up...

14:34.740 --> 14:36.107
Uh-huh?

14:36.140 --> 14:37.710
"Ill see you at the harbor."

14:37.743 --> 14:39.110
Okay.

14:39.144 --> 14:40.645
The harbor,
that's... that's good.

14:40.678 --> 14:42.047
Did he say which one?

14:44.048 --> 14:45.985
Im sorry!

14:46.018 --> 14:48.386
No, no, no, you did great.

14:48.419 --> 14:50.288
You've helped us out
a great deal, Caitlyn.

14:50.322 --> 14:51.557
Thank you so much.

14:51.590 --> 14:53.725
You asked me for advice,
and I gave it to you.

14:53.759 --> 14:56.461
You got to bring this
to McGarrett, like, now.

14:56.495 --> 14:57.696
I cant! Okay?

14:57.730 --> 15:00.099
Not until Im 100% sure
that it was Tory.

15:00.131 --> 15:01.500
I owe Layla that much.

15:01.533 --> 15:02.533
Do you?
Yeah.

15:02.567 --> 15:03.668
Yeah.

15:03.701 --> 15:06.971
I think you should maybe
rethink your priorities, Joon.

15:07.005 --> 15:08.539
No?

15:08.573 --> 15:11.043
If McGarrett finds out that
you're sitting on information

15:11.076 --> 15:12.677
that slowed down
an investigation,

15:12.711 --> 15:13.745
you could be out of a job.

15:13.778 --> 15:15.280
You don't think I know that?

15:15.313 --> 15:17.649
See, it wasn't that long ago
that I was there for you

15:17.682 --> 15:20.485
when you got mixed up
with the gun in Adams house.

15:32.664 --> 15:34.165
That was entirely different

15:34.198 --> 15:36.668
cause Adam was one of us.

15:36.701 --> 15:39.370
Tani, I get that Layla
means nothing to you,

15:39.404 --> 15:41.173
but she means a lot to me.

15:45.543 --> 15:47.513
Okay.

15:53.451 --> 15:54.753
All right, I got your back.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.389
Whatever you need to do,
just do it, and do it fast.

15:57.423 --> 16:00.259
All right. Just give me one
hour, okay? Just let me talk

16:00.292 --> 16:02.160
to Layla and see
what I can find out.

16:02.193 --> 16:04.797
Okay.

16:04.830 --> 16:06.264
Thank you.

16:09.134 --> 16:11.570
Wait. Wh... D...
Do you want me to come?

16:11.602 --> 16:14.005
No, its okay. I got this.

16:22.548 --> 16:24.115
Just a minute.

16:26.684 --> 16:28.586
Junior, wow.

16:28.620 --> 16:31.823
I know its been a while, but
you did say we should catch up.

16:31.856 --> 16:33.826
Yeah, that was, uh,

16:33.859 --> 16:35.310
that was quite a while ago.

16:35.311 --> 16:36.761
Yeah.

16:36.794 --> 16:40.264
I remember because this guy
was about to pop.

16:40.298 --> 16:43.802
You want to introduce me?

16:43.836 --> 16:45.770
Yeah, yeah, uh, Junior,

16:45.803 --> 16:47.840
this is Kai.

16:47.873 --> 16:50.109
Hey, Kai. Hey, buddy.

16:50.142 --> 16:51.677
Um...

16:51.710 --> 16:53.544
You like trucks?

16:55.480 --> 16:56.782
<i>Tory and I did the math,</i>

16:56.815 --> 16:59.418
and after paying for daycare

16:59.451 --> 17:01.519
Id maybe be breaking even
with what I was making

17:01.552 --> 17:02.855
from teaching, so I figured,

17:02.888 --> 17:04.690
why pay someone else
to watch my kid?

17:04.722 --> 17:06.424
Yeah. Well,
it makes sense.

17:06.458 --> 17:10.395
I always knew you'd make
a great mom someday.

17:10.429 --> 17:12.297
Thanks.

17:15.901 --> 17:17.353
Uh, sorry, I need to put
Kai down for his nap.

17:17.354 --> 17:18.804
Yeah, of course.

17:18.836 --> 17:22.106
Oh...

17:22.141 --> 17:24.242
Come on, little man.

17:24.276 --> 17:25.877
Time for some shut-eye.

17:25.911 --> 17:28.380
Lets go. Uh, just

17:28.413 --> 17:30.415
give me one sec. Okay, Ill...

18:05.517 --> 18:06.701
Sorry about that.

18:06.702 --> 18:07.885
No, no, you're okay.

18:07.920 --> 18:11.522
So, uh, how is Tory, by the way?
What's he been up to these days?

18:11.557 --> 18:14.425
Oh, he's good. He's got a job at
a body shop. He's been working

18:14.460 --> 18:16.828
really hard, taking a lot
of overtime and stuff.

18:16.862 --> 18:19.498
Its not easy supporting
a family on a single income,

18:19.530 --> 18:21.365
but...
...we manage.

18:21.400 --> 18:24.269
Yeah. He still hanging around
with the same crew

18:24.303 --> 18:25.604
from back in the day?

18:25.636 --> 18:28.339
Why would you ask that?

18:28.373 --> 18:31.542
I don't know. Y-You know,
you two have a kid together.

18:31.576 --> 18:34.212
I just like to think he's
keeping himself out of trouble.

18:36.414 --> 18:38.217
Okay, Junior, what is this?

18:38.250 --> 18:39.884
Why are you really here?

18:39.917 --> 18:43.255
All right, okay,
Layla, listen to me.

18:43.288 --> 18:44.722
All right, I need
you to hear what

18:44.756 --> 18:47.192
Im about to tell you, okay?
There was a bank robbery

18:47.226 --> 18:48.759
this morning
and I have reason to believe

18:48.794 --> 18:50.729
that Tory was involved.

18:50.761 --> 18:51.563
God, you're unbelievable.

18:51.564 --> 18:52.364
No, no, no. All I...

18:52.396 --> 18:53.531
Dont touch me.

18:53.532 --> 18:54.665
O-Okay. All I need to know

18:54.700 --> 18:57.568
is where he was from 7:00 a.m.
to 9:00 this morning.

18:57.603 --> 19:00.605
If you wanted to interrogate me
about my boyfriend,

19:00.638 --> 19:02.773
you shouldve said so,
instead of coming here

19:02.807 --> 19:05.576
and pretending you give a damn
about me and my kid.

19:05.611 --> 19:07.913
No, no, no, Layla, I care about
you, okay? That's why Im here.

19:07.945 --> 19:09.647
Because I don't want HPD

19:09.681 --> 19:11.349
busting through those doors,
tearing this place apart,

19:11.383 --> 19:12.817
while your baby is in the room.

19:12.851 --> 19:15.220
Oh, this is, this is you
doing me a favor?

19:15.253 --> 19:18.356
Layla, he used to run with a
bad crew, okay? He has a record.

19:18.390 --> 19:20.625
People change, Junior.

19:20.659 --> 19:23.295
You, more than anyone,
should know that.

19:28.267 --> 19:30.301
Do you want to know
where he was this morning?

19:30.335 --> 19:32.637
He was at work,

19:32.671 --> 19:34.705
providing for his family.

19:37.442 --> 19:39.711
Let yourself out.

19:44.583 --> 19:47.486
I was able to use cell tower
data to triangulate

19:47.519 --> 19:48.753
the last position
of the callers.

19:48.787 --> 19:51.355
Now within an hour
of the bank heist,

19:51.390 --> 19:52.691
one burner pinged

19:52.723 --> 19:54.593
a tower within a mile
from the bank.

19:54.625 --> 19:55.760
This clearly belonged to one

19:55.794 --> 19:57.261
of the crew members
that hit the bank.

19:57.296 --> 19:59.330
And Milos pinged
where wed expect it,

19:59.364 --> 20:00.665
within the vicinity of the house

20:00.699 --> 20:01.967
where he was holding
Carls wife hostage.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.868
And then this third number

20:03.902 --> 20:06.270
pinged a tower downtown.

20:06.305 --> 20:07.372
Theres your criminal mastermind.

20:07.405 --> 20:08.606
That's the guy who planned it.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.709
Stands to reason he would be

20:10.741 --> 20:12.711
not involved and at
some other location

20:12.743 --> 20:14.512
just sitting by the phone
waiting for a call

20:14.546 --> 20:15.480
telling him how the job went.

20:15.513 --> 20:17.715
That's what I was thinking,
cause at 8:41,

20:17.749 --> 20:19.550
seven minutes after
the crew fled the bank,

20:19.585 --> 20:20.719
they called the number downtown.

20:20.751 --> 20:23.588
The number downtown
then called Milo.

20:23.622 --> 20:26.458
And immediately thereafter,
all three were turned off.

20:26.490 --> 20:28.059
We checked in with the
HDOTs Harbor Division.

20:28.093 --> 20:30.295
Theres an alert out,
but so far no

20:30.328 --> 20:31.529
suspicious activity.

20:31.563 --> 20:32.998
Uh, if they're using
the harbors, they're gone.

20:33.030 --> 20:34.066
I mean, I agree with you,

20:34.098 --> 20:36.634
but we got to work
with the leads we got, right?

20:36.667 --> 20:38.604
So this last spot where
the phones were last used

20:38.636 --> 20:40.005
and turned off, Im thinking
theres a good chance

20:40.038 --> 20:41.707
that's where they were dumped,

20:41.740 --> 20:43.674
maybe even the truck, too.
So why don't we get down to HPD,

20:43.709 --> 20:45.711
have them send all
available units down there,

20:45.743 --> 20:47.546
search the area.
In the meantime,

20:47.578 --> 20:49.080
lets follow
the harbor lead, all right?

20:49.114 --> 20:50.715
Okay.

20:50.749 --> 20:53.818
Oh, hey, Tani Rey.
Wheres Junior?

20:53.852 --> 20:56.387
Um, yeah, I think he's just
following up with a lead from

20:56.421 --> 20:58.490
one of the witness interviews.
He should be back soon.

20:58.522 --> 21:00.358
Brief him when
you see him, please.

21:00.392 --> 21:01.560
Yeah, I will.

21:01.561 --> 21:02.728
Thank you.

21:15.707 --> 21:17.643
You've
reached Officer Junior Reigns...

21:26.518 --> 21:27.818
Mind if I join?

21:31.088 --> 21:34.358
Junior. Howzit?

21:35.861 --> 21:38.864
I know you robbed
the bank this morning.

21:41.633 --> 21:43.669
Wow.

21:43.701 --> 21:45.403
Here I thought this was gonna be

21:45.436 --> 21:47.739
a nice catch-up conversation.

21:47.772 --> 21:50.808
Let me take you in,
and if you cooperate

21:50.842 --> 21:53.845
I can help you.

21:53.878 --> 21:56.847
If you don't,

21:56.882 --> 21:59.084
this won't end well.

22:15.099 --> 22:16.634
It was good seeing you, Junior.

22:31.615 --> 22:32.584
<i>Authorities have yet to release</i>

22:32.616 --> 22:34.419
the names of the two victims,

22:34.452 --> 22:36.688
but they are believed to be
a bank employee

22:36.721 --> 22:39.490
and a driver
for the armored truck company

22:39.523 --> 22:40.459
that services the bank.

22:40.491 --> 22:43.161
No word on whether this robbery
is connected

22:43.194 --> 22:45.529
to the one last week
at Union Liberty Bank...

22:45.564 --> 22:48.500
...in Honolulu.

22:48.532 --> 22:50.000
Wait till Bob hears
about this, Nick.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.802
You shouldn't have killed him.

22:53.805 --> 22:56.040
Bobs not gonna do anything.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.278
You were real cute, Nicky.

23:00.311 --> 23:03.515
Will you quit bitching?
Okay, I did what I had to do.

23:03.548 --> 23:06.183
It was a clean score
until you went psycho

23:06.218 --> 23:07.486
and started killing people.

23:07.519 --> 23:08.520
We got the money, didn't we?!

23:08.521 --> 23:09.520
And a load of unnecessary heat!

23:09.554 --> 23:11.088
Hey, hey!

23:11.123 --> 23:12.523
Both of you, knock it off.

23:12.557 --> 23:15.192
I agreed to rob a bank,

23:15.227 --> 23:17.762
not do time as an
accessory to murder.

23:19.064 --> 23:21.566
Who said were doing time?

23:21.599 --> 23:23.769
You need to chill.

23:25.170 --> 23:26.138
Did you take care of the truck?

23:26.139 --> 23:27.105
Yeah, torched it,

23:27.138 --> 23:29.473
along with the uniforms
and phones.

23:29.508 --> 23:31.041
Well, then, its not
all bad, is it?

23:31.076 --> 23:33.478
Hmm?

23:35.846 --> 23:38.583
Hold on.

23:38.616 --> 23:39.785
Wheres Milo?

23:39.817 --> 23:42.487
Milo isnt here.

23:42.520 --> 23:46.625
Everything changed
when you went off book.

23:46.657 --> 23:48.160
We didn't plan on
leaving witnesses,

23:48.192 --> 23:49.994
so I had to send Milo
to take care of the wife.

23:50.028 --> 23:51.529
Got it.

23:53.597 --> 23:55.634
But how longs it take
to put a bullet in her head?

23:58.702 --> 24:00.137
He's got a point.

24:00.172 --> 24:01.506
What if the reason that
Milo isnt here

24:01.539 --> 24:02.606
is because the cops got him?

24:05.242 --> 24:07.679
Lookit, you let me
worry about Milo.

24:10.080 --> 24:13.551
Take these new burners...

24:13.585 --> 24:14.719
go back to work.

24:16.188 --> 24:17.655
Or go wherever
you degenerates go

24:17.689 --> 24:18.990
when you waste your time.

24:19.023 --> 24:22.560
The point is,
stay out of trouble.

24:22.594 --> 24:25.630
Lay low, all right?

24:25.663 --> 24:27.566
Until I call you
on these new burners

24:27.598 --> 24:30.669
and set up a meet, where we can
divvy up everything.

24:30.701 --> 24:32.604
You got it?

24:32.636 --> 24:34.506
Yeah.

24:35.673 --> 24:37.041
You sure we can trust you

24:37.075 --> 24:39.211
to do the accounting
on this one?

24:47.818 --> 24:49.753
What did you just say?

24:51.756 --> 24:53.557
Im just joking, Bob.
I trust you.

24:53.592 --> 24:55.759
I trust you.

25:01.866 --> 25:03.969
Besides...

25:05.303 --> 25:07.939
I know where you live. Mm.

25:07.972 --> 25:10.208
Lets go, boys.

25:31.997 --> 25:33.664
Guess it isnt good news, then.

25:33.698 --> 25:35.366
Milos dead.

25:35.400 --> 25:39.304
A guy I know in the department
confirmed it.

25:39.336 --> 25:41.806
But its not all bad news.

25:41.839 --> 25:44.875
Were better off with him dead
than in custody.

25:44.910 --> 25:46.076
And everybodys take
just went up.

25:48.012 --> 25:50.015
Stash this away somewhere safe.

25:51.883 --> 25:54.219
Dont be flashing
the cash around.

25:54.251 --> 25:56.988
The cops are watching.

26:00.090 --> 26:02.993
And understand,

26:03.028 --> 26:05.730
if one of us goes down,

26:05.763 --> 26:07.731
we all go down.

26:07.766 --> 26:09.768
Huh?

26:09.800 --> 26:12.671
And listen.

26:12.703 --> 26:14.905
The hard parts behind us,

26:14.940 --> 26:16.240
so don't do anything stupid,

26:16.273 --> 26:18.742
and well get away
from this free.

26:18.777 --> 26:22.948
Yeah, about that.

26:25.951 --> 26:27.786
I think we have a problem.

26:34.726 --> 26:37.695
Im sorry, I should have
brought this to you sooner.

26:37.729 --> 26:38.997
Yeah, you should have.

26:39.029 --> 26:42.433
You know, after everything
you done for me, I...

26:42.467 --> 26:43.667
It kills me to think
that I let you down.

26:43.701 --> 26:47.872
But when it comes to Layla,
there is nothing in this world

26:47.905 --> 26:49.273
that I wouldn't do
to protect her.

26:49.307 --> 26:51.675
Well, Junior, heres the thing.

26:51.710 --> 26:53.811
We've all got our blind spots.
All right?

26:53.845 --> 26:55.814
The trick is making sure
you identify them,

26:55.846 --> 26:58.717
and don't let them cloud
your decision-making process.

26:58.750 --> 27:00.250
That's it.
Understood.

27:00.285 --> 27:03.253
Hey. I got something
for you guys to see.

27:03.288 --> 27:05.390
Remember that cell phone that
pinged right after the heist?

27:05.423 --> 27:07.692
The one that we assumed
belonged to whoever was planning

27:07.726 --> 27:09.027
- the whole thing?
- Yeah.

27:09.059 --> 27:12.896
Well, I took a closer look
at the area

27:12.931 --> 27:15.767
that it was last active,
and check this out.

27:16.901 --> 27:17.868
Appears we've been looking

27:17.902 --> 27:19.203
for the wrong kind of harbor.

27:21.239 --> 27:23.107
Hey.

27:23.141 --> 27:24.942
Five-O.

27:24.976 --> 27:27.077
Got some pictures
for you to look at.

27:27.112 --> 27:28.813
You recognize those guys?

27:30.080 --> 27:33.284
Yeah, I recognize these guys.
They were here earlier today.

27:33.317 --> 27:35.452
Uh, room 381.

27:35.487 --> 27:37.756
Old dude rented it out
for the day, paid cash.

27:39.289 --> 27:40.959
Didnt you find it
a little bit odd

27:40.991 --> 27:42.826
that five grown men
would rent out

27:42.861 --> 27:43.728
a single motel room

27:43.761 --> 27:44.829
for the day?

27:44.830 --> 27:45.896
Mm-mm.

27:45.930 --> 27:48.066
Hey, man,
we get all kinds of crazy here.

27:48.098 --> 27:50.268
Stopped asking questions
about two weeks into this job.

27:50.300 --> 27:52.336
All right, were gonna
need to see that room.

27:52.369 --> 27:54.038
No problem.
Housekeeping just finished up

27:54.072 --> 27:57.142
in there, but it hasn't
been rented out yet.

27:57.174 --> 27:58.410
So what's the plan?

27:58.442 --> 28:00.045
Maybe get a CSU team down here,

28:00.077 --> 28:02.279
have them sweep the room
to get about a thousand prints

28:02.313 --> 28:04.415
from a thousand
different people,

28:04.449 --> 28:06.451
many of whom will come back
with criminal records

28:06.483 --> 28:08.318
due to the general scumbaggery

28:08.353 --> 28:10.020
that goes on
in this establishment?

28:10.055 --> 28:11.990
No offense.
None taken.

28:13.223 --> 28:15.492
You still got the key card
the old guy

28:15.527 --> 28:16.827
turned in on checkout?

28:18.296 --> 28:20.298
So, the print
from the key card came back,

28:20.330 --> 28:21.266
and we have an ID.

28:21.298 --> 28:23.134
The last person to rent the room

28:23.167 --> 28:25.269
was a Robert Castor,
and... surprise, surprise...

28:25.303 --> 28:27.971
he worked
as an armored truck driver

28:28.006 --> 28:29.973
for Honolulu Armored Services.

28:30.008 --> 28:32.277
He was printed as part
of his security check.

28:32.309 --> 28:34.144
Heres another fun fact
about Castor:

28:34.179 --> 28:37.315
he himself used to handle
the pickups

28:37.347 --> 28:39.384
at Bank of Oahu
and Union Liberty.

28:39.416 --> 28:40.451
Those robberies <i>are</i> connected.

28:40.484 --> 28:42.554
Starts out small,

28:42.586 --> 28:44.455
just hitting up the tellers
at Union Liberty,

28:44.489 --> 28:45.990
and then he graduates to robbing

28:46.023 --> 28:47.125
the vault at Bank of Oahu.

28:47.157 --> 28:49.227
Uses his inside knowledge
to put together the plan,

28:49.259 --> 28:51.162
then hires a crew to do
the heavy lifting.

28:51.195 --> 28:53.530
Theres more.
According to employment records,

28:53.565 --> 28:55.967
Castor retired six months ago,

28:56.000 --> 28:57.469
but due to some contested
disciplinary action,

28:57.501 --> 28:59.537
he was stripped of his pension.

28:59.570 --> 29:00.921
Theres your motive.

29:00.922 --> 29:02.272
We have a BOLO out
on Castor and his vehicle?

29:02.307 --> 29:03.374
Even better.

29:03.407 --> 29:05.276
HPDs at his house.
Just picked him up.

29:05.309 --> 29:06.310
They're bringing him in.

29:06.344 --> 29:07.311
Perfect.

29:07.345 --> 29:09.346
Well see you soon.

29:10.381 --> 29:12.083
What is that?

29:12.116 --> 29:14.352
Just got a text from Layla.

29:14.384 --> 29:16.287
"Joon, I need to talk to you.

29:16.320 --> 29:19.490
Meet me at Thomas Square Park
by the fountain, 30 minutes."

29:22.026 --> 29:24.095
Mr. Castor.

29:24.128 --> 29:26.830
We both agree that you seem
like a brass tacks kind of guy,

29:26.865 --> 29:29.433
so we figured wed just get straight
down to business, all right?

29:29.467 --> 29:31.435
We know that you helped plan

29:31.469 --> 29:32.836
the Union Liberty Bank heist
last week.

29:32.871 --> 29:34.271
We also know that you were part

29:34.305 --> 29:35.839
of the Bank of Oahu heist.

29:35.874 --> 29:37.107
That left two people dead.

29:37.142 --> 29:38.409
Those are both on your old, uh,

29:38.442 --> 29:40.211
armored truck route, right?

29:43.347 --> 29:45.415
You know, old-school guys,

29:45.450 --> 29:46.451
they never talk.

29:46.452 --> 29:47.451
Unless, of course,

29:47.484 --> 29:49.953
they know that we have evidence
that puts them dead to rights.

29:49.988 --> 29:51.588
And then they usually figure out
its in their best interest

29:51.623 --> 29:53.423
to cooperate with us.

29:53.458 --> 29:55.292
I don't think he knows
that we have his money yet.

29:55.326 --> 29:56.461
Oh.

29:56.493 --> 29:58.195
We got your money.

29:58.229 --> 29:59.864
I probably shouldve opened
with that, right?

29:59.897 --> 30:02.133
See, HPD, they tore
your place apart.

30:02.166 --> 30:04.335
They didn't find your money,
but they did find

30:04.368 --> 30:07.372
the key to a very large
safety-deposit box

30:07.404 --> 30:09.339
registered over
at Certified National Bank.

30:09.374 --> 30:11.342
That was a safe play.

30:11.375 --> 30:13.443
Ill tell you what
else is a safe play.

30:13.478 --> 30:15.078
You coming to the table first.

30:15.113 --> 30:16.513
Now, why don't you
give us your crew

30:16.548 --> 30:18.383
before they come in
and flip on you?

30:23.221 --> 30:25.155
Im sorry, is something funny?

30:25.190 --> 30:28.326
You two, you think you got it
all figured out, don't you?

30:28.358 --> 30:29.527
Huh?

30:29.560 --> 30:33.631
You don't get to be my age
without learning a thing or two.

30:33.664 --> 30:36.667
And one thing I do know is...

30:36.701 --> 30:41.338
overconfidence
always sinks the ship.

31:07.298 --> 31:10.000
Im sorry, Junior.

31:24.715 --> 31:26.451
Ill get him.

31:26.483 --> 31:28.987
All right, Im coming, Im coming.

31:33.156 --> 31:35.559
Hey. What's
wrong, huh?

31:35.593 --> 31:37.394
Come here.

31:37.427 --> 31:38.730
Come here.

31:38.762 --> 31:40.330
Yeah.

31:40.365 --> 31:41.732
Hey.

31:41.766 --> 31:43.433
You all right?

31:48.439 --> 31:49.574
Think he's hungry.

31:49.606 --> 31:51.409
Hey...

31:51.442 --> 31:52.644
Come on.
Oh-ho-ho.

31:52.676 --> 31:55.613
Baby, no.
Come on, Kai.

31:55.646 --> 31:57.648
Oh, no. Mm...

31:57.682 --> 31:58.650
- I have to go to work.
- Okay, babe.

31:58.682 --> 32:00.652
Hey, uh, come. Come here.

32:02.653 --> 32:04.221
Have a good day.

32:04.255 --> 32:05.390
I love you.

32:05.423 --> 32:07.025
Im so proud of you.

32:10.094 --> 32:11.496
Oh.

32:11.528 --> 32:14.332
Okay, here we go... time to eat.

32:21.306 --> 32:24.509
Remember who you're
doing this for.

32:24.541 --> 32:26.711
You got a family to think about.

32:26.743 --> 32:28.346
If we go down for this,

32:28.378 --> 32:30.548
you're looking at 20 minimum.

32:30.580 --> 32:33.651
You think they're gonna wait
around for you to get out?

32:33.684 --> 32:35.219
Mm-mm.

32:36.721 --> 32:38.722
Find out exactly
what the cops know.

32:40.424 --> 32:42.759
Then kill him.

32:54.771 --> 32:57.141
All right, Tory, its over.

32:57.174 --> 32:59.109
We know about Nick,
Owen and Kalino.

32:59.143 --> 33:01.045
They're going away,
and so are you.

33:01.078 --> 33:03.580
Castor made a deal,
but you can still save yourself.

33:05.148 --> 33:06.651
Let me take you in.

33:06.683 --> 33:09.820
If you cooperate,
I can get you a deal.

33:09.854 --> 33:11.756
No, you're lying.

33:11.788 --> 33:13.624
You're saying what you
think you need to say

33:13.657 --> 33:15.660
so I don't kill you.

33:26.604 --> 33:28.605
See, you almost had me.

33:28.638 --> 33:30.173
But you made one mistake.

33:31.509 --> 33:33.344
Layla never calls me Joon.

33:38.516 --> 33:40.651
We need to bail, now.

33:40.684 --> 33:43.653
If they take him in,
he's gonna roll on us.

33:50.694 --> 33:52.663
You aint no killer.

33:52.697 --> 33:54.398
So Tory,

33:54.432 --> 33:57.701
put that gun down, lets talk.

34:03.307 --> 34:04.709
That's-that's it.

34:04.741 --> 34:07.278
Put it down.

34:08.780 --> 34:10.114
That's it.

34:12.617 --> 34:14.485
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

35:18.748 --> 35:20.284
Junior.

35:20.318 --> 35:22.219
Were good here.

35:22.253 --> 35:24.422
HPDs on the way. Where are you?

35:24.454 --> 35:25.922
Im right on him. I got this.

36:01.025 --> 36:02.827
Put the weapon down.

36:02.860 --> 36:04.795
Now.

36:15.472 --> 36:17.974
I cant go back to jail, man.

36:19.943 --> 36:22.313
I cant do that kind
of time. I cant...

36:22.346 --> 36:24.382
Okay, Tory, listen.

36:24.414 --> 36:28.485
If you're not gonna do it for
yourself, then think about Kai.

36:28.518 --> 36:29.920
All right?

36:29.954 --> 36:32.489
Think about Layla.

36:32.523 --> 36:34.525
They're all I ever think about!

36:38.896 --> 36:42.333
What I did, man...

36:43.800 --> 36:46.469
...I did for them.

36:46.503 --> 36:48.539
And I know that.

36:48.572 --> 36:50.708
All right, Tory?
And they're gonna know that.

36:50.740 --> 36:52.976
And you'll get to
see your son again.

36:53.010 --> 36:55.579
And Laylas gonna forgive you.

36:55.612 --> 36:58.048
Kai is gonna forgive you.

36:58.081 --> 37:00.617
I cant live in a cage, man.

37:05.655 --> 37:09.626
I cant let my little boy
see me live in a cage.

37:14.898 --> 37:17.601
Put the gun down.

37:17.635 --> 37:20.972
Tory, put the weapon down.

37:27.478 --> 37:28.579
Tory?

37:28.612 --> 37:30.447
No...

37:30.481 --> 37:32.650
No.

37:32.682 --> 37:35.987
No, don't you even
think about that.

37:36.019 --> 37:37.504
Please.

37:37.505 --> 37:38.989
Its the only way, man.

37:39.023 --> 37:41.791
No, brother, come on.

37:42.793 --> 37:44.961
No.

37:44.996 --> 37:46.963
Put the gun down.

37:46.998 --> 37:48.465
Please.

37:49.400 --> 37:50.434
Tory.

37:50.467 --> 37:51.668
No, no, no, no, no!

38:00.777 --> 38:03.014
Im so proud of you.

38:09.954 --> 38:11.688
No!

38:11.722 --> 38:13.824
Okay. Im right here,
buddy. Im right here.

38:13.858 --> 38:15.726
Come on... help!

38:15.760 --> 38:17.594
Get an ambulance
right now! Move!

38:17.628 --> 38:19.730
Tory. Hey.

38:19.764 --> 38:21.766
Tory, come on.
Stay with me, buddy!

38:21.798 --> 38:24.768
No! No!

38:24.802 --> 38:26.469
We got a 10-71.

38:26.503 --> 38:28.938
Im sorry, man. Im sorry.

38:55.833 --> 38:57.835
Joons.

38:57.867 --> 39:01.539
Hey. You know its not
your fault, right?

39:01.572 --> 39:03.541
Theres absolutely
nothing you couldve done

39:03.574 --> 39:05.543
that wouldve changed the result.

39:17.954 --> 39:20.557
You know, when I left for Iraq,

39:20.590 --> 39:23.193
it was only supposed
to be for one tour.

39:23.226 --> 39:27.097
You know, I was just supposed
to go get experience

39:27.130 --> 39:29.532
and qualify for GI benefits
and then come straight back home

39:29.567 --> 39:32.635
and then I marry Layla.
That was the plan.

39:33.704 --> 39:36.639
Until the plan changed.

39:39.210 --> 39:41.177
What happened?

39:41.211 --> 39:45.548
After my first tour, they asked
me to re-up, and I, uh,

39:45.583 --> 39:48.686
I didn't hesitate.

39:50.186 --> 39:53.690
Yeah, I mean, you, you were
doing what you loved to do.

39:53.724 --> 39:57.161
Right. Right.

39:57.193 --> 40:01.498
Meanwhile, the person
that I loved

40:01.532 --> 40:04.835
was waiting on the other side
of the world,

40:04.869 --> 40:07.670
for me.

40:07.704 --> 40:10.807
In my head, I just thought,
you know,

40:10.840 --> 40:12.976
wed just pressed pause.

40:13.010 --> 40:15.545
You know, all the time I was
away, I never questioned us,

40:15.579 --> 40:17.181
not for one second.

40:17.213 --> 40:19.617
You know, I thought that

40:19.650 --> 40:22.753
we would just pick up
from exactly where I left off.

40:25.088 --> 40:27.824
No.

40:27.858 --> 40:32.695
For her, that wait was hard.

40:34.197 --> 40:36.833
She was alone, and...

40:36.867 --> 40:40.103
she grew sick of waiting for me,

40:40.137 --> 40:43.007
feeling second best
to my life as a SEAL.

40:43.039 --> 40:46.577
And then... then she met Tory.

40:49.079 --> 40:51.782
You know, and he-he was there.

40:51.815 --> 40:53.617
You know?

40:53.650 --> 40:55.786
H-He was around.

40:55.820 --> 40:59.657
I wasn't.

41:01.125 --> 41:03.960
She ended it
with a letter, you know?

41:05.996 --> 41:09.532
She wrote it to me
and she told me it was over.

41:14.137 --> 41:17.875
Seven and a half thousand
miles away,

41:17.907 --> 41:22.045
sitting underneath a wall
in a compound in Tagab,

41:22.079 --> 41:25.014
and there was
nothing I could do.

41:27.318 --> 41:31.021
When I came home and I found out
she was having Torys baby,

41:31.054 --> 41:32.856
oh...

41:34.592 --> 41:37.327
Ugh...

41:37.360 --> 41:38.996
You know, I...

41:39.028 --> 41:42.833
I knew itd be selfish of me
to fight for her.

41:42.867 --> 41:45.835
Joons, Im so sorry.

41:45.869 --> 41:46.836
No...

41:48.338 --> 41:52.543
You know, Tani, Ive made some
mistakes in my life, but...

41:54.777 --> 41:58.148
...losing Layla,
or, uh,

41:58.181 --> 42:01.251
pushing her away, that was...

42:07.257 --> 42:09.827
So when you say, uh,

42:09.860 --> 42:12.829
theres nothing different
that I could have done...

42:14.297 --> 42:17.668
...yeah, I tend to disagree.
