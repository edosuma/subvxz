01:30.299 --> 01:32.384
Hello?

01:32.384 --> 01:34.469
Ebony?

01:36.722 --> 01:39.558
Ebony's not home.

01:39.558 --> 01:41.685
Ebony's in Bali.

01:44.229 --> 01:46.815
Who is this?

01:46.815 --> 01:48.608
Nikola.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.779
Kol?

01:52.779 --> 01:54.781
Kol Dennick?

01:56.533 --> 01:58.618
Denic.

02:00.662 --> 02:02.622
You've grown up.

02:03.623 --> 02:06.209
You all right, love?

02:06.209 --> 02:09.129
Bit of a suss hour
to be calling.

02:13.467 --> 02:16.178
I know.

02:16.178 --> 02:18.263
I was just thinking about her.

02:18.263 --> 02:20.932
Oh, darl, I-I...

02:22.934 --> 02:26.355
Uh, I wasn't thinking about her.
It's...

02:30.901 --> 02:33.695
I'm sorry.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.820
Okay. Okay.

03:56.820 --> 03:58.530
Okay.

04:08.832 --> 04:10.625
Fuck.

04:11.501 --> 04:13.086
Fuck.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.717
Oh. Excuse me!

04:19.551 --> 04:21.553
Excuse me! Hi. Hi.

04:21.553 --> 04:23.138
Sorry. So sorry to bother you.

04:23.138 --> 04:24.890
Um, do you have 40 cents?

04:24.890 --> 04:28.018
- Do you have 40 cents?
- Okay.

04:28.018 --> 04:29.394
Just 40 cents?

04:29.394 --> 04:31.563
- Thank you so much.
- No worries.

04:31.563 --> 04:33.607
Thank you. Thank you!

04:34.691 --> 04:37.235
Okay. Okay.

04:42.657 --> 04:44.534
Fuck.

05:10.936 --> 05:12.604
Ladies and gentlemen,

05:12.604 --> 05:14.898
it's star time
at the Apollo Theater.

05:14.898 --> 05:17.817
Everybody, the hardest-working
man in show business.

06:24.634 --> 06:25.719
I said don't come in!

06:25.719 --> 06:27.095
- It's your girlfriend.

06:27.345 --> 06:29.681
Don't take five hours.
I'm downloading.

06:29.681 --> 06:32.225
- What? What is it?
What the fuck, Kol?

06:32.225 --> 06:33.768
I've been redialing for yonks.

06:33.768 --> 06:36.021
It's 'cause of the dial-up.
Ivo's been logged in.

06:36.021 --> 06:37.606
What is it? Where are you?

06:37.606 --> 06:39.357
Please don't yell at me.

06:39.357 --> 06:41.109
Why would I yell at you?

06:43.737 --> 06:45.447
Ebony, where are you?

06:45.447 --> 06:47.157
I don't know.

06:47.157 --> 06:48.700
What do you mean,
you don't know?

06:48.700 --> 06:51.161
We were going to the beach,
to this guy's dad's boat,

06:51.161 --> 06:52.746
and-and this guy,

06:52.746 --> 06:55.040
he was gonna get the boat,
and, um, Tari had some speed,

06:55.040 --> 06:57.167
but I-I only took, like,
the teensiest, tiniest, like...

06:57.167 --> 06:58.877
like not even a full line,
like a half...

06:58.877 --> 07:00.754
like a half line, like a hyphen.
I was fine.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.672
I remember I was, like, chill,
and he was gonna

07:02.672 --> 07:04.299
go get the boat,
this guy from Saint Basil.

07:04.299 --> 07:05.759
- Guy from where?

07:05.759 --> 07:07.552
- I fucking swear...
- I can't hear you.

07:07.552 --> 07:09.679
Saint Basil. Saint Basil.

07:09.679 --> 07:11.431
His dad had a boat.
Listen, please.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.725
And he was a bit...
a bit grabby, baby,

07:13.725 --> 07:15.310
but not, like, sleaze-o, so...

07:15.310 --> 07:16.936
so I was like,
"Yeah, okay," like...

07:16.936 --> 07:18.772
Like, I mean, I was practically
a nun through schoolies,

07:18.772 --> 07:20.482
and Wansajah and Tari
were complete sluts...

07:20.482 --> 07:21.733
Did you have breakfast?
It'll get cold...

07:21.733 --> 07:23.109
I understand literally nothing

07:23.109 --> 07:24.694
of what you're saying to me.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.196
I know. I know. I just...

07:26.196 --> 07:28.740
I don't want you to think
he was this total rando.

07:28.740 --> 07:30.075
And, yeah, okay,
he was a bit older,

07:30.075 --> 07:31.576
but he wasn't, like, old.

07:31.576 --> 07:33.578
Like, he was... he was
on his P's, so it's just...

07:33.578 --> 07:34.913
we couldn't find his dad's boat,

07:34.913 --> 07:38.541
and we were at the beach,
and then, um...

07:38.541 --> 07:40.043
and then I don't remember.

07:40.043 --> 07:42.545
Ebony, you are not cohesing.
I don't know what to do.

07:42.545 --> 07:44.005
Tell me what you want me to do.

07:44.005 --> 07:45.215
I know. I know. I just...

07:45.215 --> 07:48.176
My bag's gone and... my shoes.

07:48.176 --> 07:50.261
One of them's gone, too.

07:50.261 --> 07:51.596
And...

07:51.596 --> 07:54.766
Kol, my dress
for the Civic Centre,

07:54.766 --> 07:57.352
it's at Tari's, it's at Tari's.

07:57.352 --> 08:00.522
You have to come get me, Kol.
You have to come get me.

08:00.522 --> 08:01.898
I have to come get you?

08:01.898 --> 08:03.650
I have to be
at the Civic Centre.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.860
In less than like two hours,
like you do.

08:05.860 --> 08:08.446
Oh, my God, Kol,
are you even, like, listening?

08:08.446 --> 08:09.906
I don't know where I am.

08:09.906 --> 08:11.658
You have to go to Tari's,

08:11.658 --> 08:14.202
you have to get my dress, and
then you have to come get me.

08:14.202 --> 08:15.704
Like, do you understand?
There's no time.

08:15.704 --> 08:17.706
We'll have to drive
straight there.

08:17.706 --> 08:18.957
Straight there.

08:18.957 --> 08:20.917
How am I gonna come get you?!

08:20.917 --> 08:22.627
I don't know!
Like, your mum and stuff.

08:22.627 --> 08:24.087
Get her to give us a lift.

08:24.087 --> 08:25.714
My mum's just come home
from a night shift.

08:25.714 --> 08:27.340
She won't want to drive to...

08:27.340 --> 08:28.633
- Wait.

08:28.633 --> 08:30.260
Where in Christ's hell
even are you?

08:30.260 --> 08:32.220
- What's the name of the beach?
- I need the Internet!

08:32.220 --> 08:33.221
Fuck off!

08:33.221 --> 08:35.432
What?
- Isn't there a sign?

08:35.432 --> 08:37.308
What's the name of the beach?

08:37.308 --> 08:38.977
There's a street sign.
There's a street sign.

08:38.977 --> 08:40.478
Get the Melway's.
There's a street sign.

08:40.478 --> 08:42.105
- I'm on Allenby Street.
- Ellenby?

08:42.105 --> 08:44.315
Allenby, you idiot! Hurry up!

08:44.315 --> 08:47.527
Allenby Street.
Allenby Street. A-L-L.

08:49.821 --> 08:52.657
Oh, my God, Kol,
I'm, like, so cold.

08:54.784 --> 08:57.162
There's an Allenby Street in
Reservoir, one in Canterbury,

08:57.162 --> 08:58.913
one in Altona, one in Coburg.

08:58.913 --> 09:00.081
Which one?

09:00.081 --> 09:01.624
Which one has a beach?

09:01.624 --> 09:03.126
Maybe Altona?

09:03.126 --> 09:04.544
But that's like ages away.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.129
Yeah, well, it must be
one of the others, then.

09:06.129 --> 09:07.630
So ask someone.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.716
There's no one around.
And stop yelling at me.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.217
There must be someone.

09:11.217 --> 09:13.553
Just hang on a second!

09:13.553 --> 09:15.847
Fucking hell.

09:15.847 --> 09:18.433
Okay. Don't hang up, okay?

09:25.815 --> 09:29.027
I forgot to wash
your clothes again?

09:29.027 --> 09:32.238
It's the finals...
Year 12 finals...

09:32.238 --> 09:34.157
I'm dancing...

09:38.369 --> 09:39.871
My handsome man.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.923
Altona. I'm in Altona.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.758
Kol, are you there?

09:53.259 --> 09:55.887
- I'm in Altona. Come get me.

09:55.887 --> 09:57.055
Hello!

09:57.055 --> 09:58.848
- Fucking come how, Ebony?

09:58.848 --> 10:00.725
Stop yelling at me!

10:00.725 --> 10:03.186
I think we need
to call your mum.

10:04.145 --> 10:06.064
- Altona's an hour away.
- Don't you dare.

10:06.064 --> 10:08.358
Don't you bloody dare,
Kol Denic.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.735
Don't you dare, Kol Denic,
I swear to God!

10:10.735 --> 10:14.072
Ebony, it's seven fucking
thirty-five a.m.

10:14.072 --> 10:16.908
I need to dress.
You need to dress.

10:16.908 --> 10:18.660
Look, we'll think
of something to say.

10:18.660 --> 10:21.037
You call my mum, I'm never
fucking dancing ever again.

10:21.037 --> 10:24.165
Not today at the Civic Centre,
not anywhere ever!

10:24.165 --> 10:27.794
I don't see how else we make
it. -Don't you dare, Kol Denic.

10:27.794 --> 10:30.880
What? -I don't see how else
we make it, Ebony!

10:33.967 --> 10:35.510
Okay, who do you know?
Who do you know?

10:35.510 --> 10:37.220
You're not being very helpful.
Who do you know?

10:37.220 --> 10:38.721
I don't know anyone else's
number by heart.

10:38.721 --> 10:40.765
This is not happening.
This is not happening.

10:40.765 --> 10:43.685
There's got to be someone
with a car.

10:43.685 --> 10:45.937
If they have a car,
they probably have a life.

10:45.937 --> 10:47.438
Duh!

10:47.438 --> 10:49.315
Asshole.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.317
Oh, hang on. Hang on.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.695
I know someone who doesn't.

10:54.863 --> 10:56.698
Who?

10:58.867 --> 11:00.410
- You still there?
- Shh!

11:00.410 --> 11:02.787
Can you please
let me concentrate?

11:04.747 --> 11:06.291
Okay. Okay.

11:06.291 --> 11:08.793
Here's what you're gonna do.

11:08.793 --> 11:10.086
Listening?

11:33.985 --> 11:36.112
Tari!

11:37.780 --> 11:39.866
She's asleep!

11:40.617 --> 11:42.619
You're Tari's sister, yeah?

11:42.619 --> 11:44.954
Yeah, Romeo. She's asleep.

11:49.959 --> 11:52.378
- Here, take it. You talk.

11:55.506 --> 11:57.342
Hello?
Hi.

11:57.342 --> 11:59.135
Um, is Adam home?

11:59.135 --> 12:01.262
- Yeah, just one sec.
- Thank you.

12:01.262 --> 12:03.222
See, what was so hard about it?

12:03.222 --> 12:04.724
Their mum knows my voice.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.684
She has to think it'd be
someone else. -ADAM: Hello?

12:06.684 --> 12:08.770
- Hey, um, Adam, yeah?
- Yeah.

12:08.770 --> 12:11.439
- Um, it's, uh, Jaya.
- Who?

12:11.439 --> 12:14.484
Uh, apparently, we went to,
uh, Watsonia High together.

12:14.484 --> 12:16.986
Um, I don't really know
what's, like, going on,

12:16.986 --> 12:20.156
but apparently there's
something up with your sister,

12:20.156 --> 12:23.576
and, um, well, this gay kid
just rocked up at my house,

12:23.576 --> 12:24.911
and I'll just give it to him

12:24.911 --> 12:26.496
so he can explain it
to you better.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.081
I'm not actually gay, actually.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.916
Anyway, I don't know what
that has to do with anything.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.793
- Uh, hi. Uh, Adam?
- Hi.

12:31.793 --> 12:33.836
Uh, it's Nikola here.
It's Kol here.

12:33.836 --> 12:35.380
Um, we kind of sort of met

12:35.380 --> 12:38.216
at Ebony's Macbeth thing,
kind of.

12:38.216 --> 12:39.884
Anyway, just say nothing
to your mum, okay?

12:39.884 --> 12:41.469
Just act like everything's
super chill.

12:41.469 --> 12:44.847
But your sister and me,
we're in deep shit.

12:50.561 --> 12:53.272
Where am I going?
Where am I going?

12:53.272 --> 12:55.191
I don't know where I'm going.

12:55.191 --> 12:57.318
- Which room?
- It's that one.

12:59.904 --> 13:01.864
Hey, hey, hey.

13:01.864 --> 13:04.450
- Tari. Tari, Tari.
Oh, my God.

13:04.450 --> 13:05.910
Tari.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.620
- Shit.
Dude.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.706
Is that Ebony's? That-that...

13:09.706 --> 13:11.040
That's Ebony's. Shit.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.458
Dude.

13:12.458 --> 13:13.710
Hey.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.586
Relax, dude.

13:15.586 --> 13:17.088
Where's the dress?

13:17.088 --> 13:18.548
- The dress!
- I don't know, man. Just chill.

13:18.548 --> 13:20.425
- Burgundy.
- Just take a moment.

13:20.425 --> 13:22.927
- With fringes.
- It's fine.

13:22.927 --> 13:25.471
Do you see any burgundy
with fringes? -

13:25.471 --> 13:27.598
- Shit.
- No, I don't.

13:27.598 --> 13:28.975
Yes.

13:31.394 --> 13:33.396
Oh, my God.

13:35.356 --> 13:38.192
Okay, okay. Okay, okay.

13:39.610 --> 13:42.739
Mm, we never saw him
with anyone.

13:43.906 --> 13:46.868
He got voted the most likely
to bomb the school.

13:47.785 --> 13:49.829
Mm.

13:50.663 --> 13:53.666
That's a category you voted on?
Of course it is.

13:53.666 --> 13:56.711
But like three of my friends
tried to fuck him.

13:59.338 --> 14:01.507
I tried to fuck him, too.

14:03.509 --> 14:06.012
Watsonia High, man.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.555
Slim bloody pickings.

14:07.555 --> 14:10.767
- That's all I can say.

14:14.479 --> 14:17.565
- Adam? Adam.

14:20.485 --> 14:22.945
Thank you, Jaya.
Jaya, thank you, okay?

14:22.945 --> 14:25.323
- Just chill, man.
- I owe you, like, my firstborn.

14:25.323 --> 14:26.741
Thanks so much. Thank you.

14:26.741 --> 14:27.992
Hi. I'm Kol.

14:27.992 --> 14:29.619
You're literally saving my life.

14:29.619 --> 14:31.579
So, where... where am I going?

14:31.579 --> 14:34.373
Um, go... go left on
Grimshaw, and then-then I'll...

14:34.373 --> 14:37.293
- I'm not sure if maybe...

14:37.293 --> 14:39.128
Uh, maybe...

14:40.004 --> 14:42.298
I'm not sure if this is
the way to...

14:43.549 --> 14:44.842
Um...

14:48.179 --> 14:50.515
- What? What is it?
- I can't... I can't tell...

14:51.474 --> 14:53.893
It's-it's just...
I-I can't tell if...

14:53.893 --> 14:56.145
I can't tell if maybe this...

14:57.438 --> 14:59.273
Is this Grimshaw?

14:59.273 --> 15:02.527
It's just, I'm-I'm...
I don't think this is the...

15:02.527 --> 15:04.070
What? What is it? Spit it out.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.822
What's the way to get to Altona

15:05.822 --> 15:08.491
and then... and then back
to the Civic Centre

15:08.491 --> 15:10.993
by-by 9:00... 8:45?

15:10.993 --> 15:12.662
Uh, 9:00. 9:00 is fine.

15:12.662 --> 15:14.664
I would say by helicopter.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.589
Maybe there's
a different road, though.

15:23.589 --> 15:25.633
There's quite a few
different... -In one hour?

15:25.633 --> 15:29.387
Unless we are literally flying,
we're gonna be lucky to make it

15:29.387 --> 15:31.180
to Altona at all,
much less there and back.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.057
There's quite a few
different roads. -If I was you,

15:33.057 --> 15:34.725
I would reschedule
your emergency dance lesson.

15:34.725 --> 15:37.854
It's not a lesson.
It's the fucking finals.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.817
It's the finals.

15:48.531 --> 15:50.533
- What are you doing?
- Stop-stop the... stop the...

15:50.533 --> 15:52.785
- What the fuck?

16:22.273 --> 16:24.275
- I'm sorry.

16:52.220 --> 16:54.680
Sorry, mate, it's not...

16:54.680 --> 16:56.057
It's not you...

16:57.475 --> 16:58.684
...entirely.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.853
It's just...

17:00.853 --> 17:03.105
a bit of a weird day for me.

17:12.573 --> 17:14.033
- It's okay.
- Hmm?

17:14.033 --> 17:15.534
It's nice music.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.750
It's Argentinian?

17:22.750 --> 17:24.126
Yeah, some of it.

17:24.126 --> 17:26.712
It's from a... from a movie.

17:28.923 --> 17:30.675
When are you flying?

17:30.675 --> 17:32.593
Tomorrow.

17:32.593 --> 17:34.178
At 1:00.

17:34.178 --> 17:35.763
That's right.

17:35.763 --> 17:37.139
Ebony mentioned.

17:37.139 --> 17:39.016
Yeah.

17:42.103 --> 17:44.730
There's always next year, right?

17:44.730 --> 17:47.441
Like, next year's finals?

17:47.441 --> 17:51.153
Your sister's applied
to all these unis in Sydney.

17:52.154 --> 17:53.906
She won't be here.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.908
What, NIDA?

17:57.285 --> 17:59.745
Ebony get into NIDA?

17:59.745 --> 18:01.622
Did we see the same play?

18:02.415 --> 18:05.751
Ebony's gonna get into NIDA,
y-you think?

18:09.255 --> 18:12.717
"Out, damn spot. Out."

18:14.760 --> 18:16.220
That's mean.

18:17.054 --> 18:19.890
Yeah, but, I mean,
if that's your main obstacle--

18:19.890 --> 18:22.518
right?-- Ebony getting into

18:22.518 --> 18:26.605
the National Dramatic Institute
of Cate Blanchetts...

18:27.648 --> 18:29.984
...hold on to your leotard.

18:44.373 --> 18:46.709
It's tobacco.

18:46.709 --> 18:48.419
What else would it be?

18:50.338 --> 18:52.757
- I-I mean, I don't smoke.
- Mm.

18:52.757 --> 18:54.342
Sorry.

18:54.342 --> 18:56.927
I know what else it would be.

18:58.637 --> 19:00.765
But you're a good boy.

19:07.563 --> 19:09.940
That's okay.

19:09.940 --> 19:12.651
Being a good boy.
Good boys make it out.

19:17.656 --> 19:19.992
The book I'm reading, actually...

19:19.992 --> 19:21.494
Hmm?

19:21.494 --> 19:24.121
It's by an Argentinian.

19:24.121 --> 19:25.790
"Bor-geez."

19:25.790 --> 19:27.625
Borges?

19:28.459 --> 19:30.044
- What?
- Yeah.

19:30.044 --> 19:32.421
You go to school with my sister,
and you're reading Borges?

19:32.421 --> 19:34.256
I went to school with
your sister. -Ah, right. Went.

19:34.256 --> 19:36.258
- We finished.
- Been hours now, hey.

19:37.551 --> 19:39.678
You're graduates.

19:39.678 --> 19:41.430
Are you jaded yet?

19:43.015 --> 19:45.976
- You're jaded.
-  Shut up.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.274
Borges, though?

19:52.274 --> 19:53.651
You're like 11.

19:53.651 --> 19:55.528
I'm 18 in like three weeks.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.530
- Asshole.

19:57.530 --> 19:58.864
Three weeks.

19:58.864 --> 20:00.908
What's that?
That's New Year's...

20:00.908 --> 20:03.119
- New Year's Eve?
- New Year's Day.

20:03.953 --> 20:06.122
New Year's Day. Hello.

20:06.122 --> 20:08.457
- Apocalypse day.
- Uh-huh.

20:08.457 --> 20:11.752
Mm. Better not be standing
next to a computer.

20:11.752 --> 20:14.130
I'll be standing
next to a Malbec.

20:15.923 --> 20:17.133
What about you?

20:17.133 --> 20:20.761
Next to three drunk uncles, probably.

20:20.761 --> 20:22.763
- In Sarajevo.
- Jesus.

20:22.763 --> 20:25.433
- For real?
- My cousin's getting married.

20:25.433 --> 20:28.310
We haven't been back
since we left, so...

20:28.310 --> 20:30.271
You're not, like, scared
you might die?

20:30.271 --> 20:32.314
I guess.

20:33.441 --> 20:36.235
I might slit my veins
from boredom.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.739
You've got a flair
for the dramatic, don't you?

20:42.700 --> 20:44.660
Is this actually
a dance costume, or is this

20:44.660 --> 20:46.787
just what a trip to the servo
looks like for you?

20:46.787 --> 20:48.372
Shut up.

20:50.624 --> 20:52.710
- What's the movie?
- Hmm?

20:53.669 --> 20:55.504
The movie.

20:56.338 --> 20:59.550
Oh, it's from, uh,
Happy Together.

20:59.550 --> 21:01.302
I haven't seen it.

21:02.052 --> 21:03.679
Yeah, well, technically,
I wouldn't have

21:03.679 --> 21:05.764
expected you to have.

21:07.016 --> 21:08.642
But then here you are,

21:08.642 --> 21:11.020
reading Borges and...

21:12.396 --> 21:15.149
...holidaying in Bosnia.

21:15.149 --> 21:17.359
Sporting some serious cleavage.

21:17.359 --> 21:19.487
- So...

21:19.487 --> 21:21.614
I'm out.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.824
I am out.

21:26.952 --> 21:28.829
Is it any good?

21:28.829 --> 21:30.456
The movie.

21:30.456 --> 21:32.708
It made me want to move
to Buenos Aires.

21:34.543 --> 21:36.212
I'll check it out.

21:39.840 --> 21:43.469
I like movies from countries
I haven't visited.

21:43.469 --> 21:46.847
So, was it the war
that brought you guys here?

21:46.847 --> 21:48.599
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

21:48.599 --> 21:50.100
The war.

21:50.935 --> 21:52.770
We don't have no bread.

21:52.770 --> 21:55.272
- We don't have no water.

21:55.272 --> 21:57.608
Tears we have only to drink.

21:57.608 --> 21:59.485
Tears.

22:03.364 --> 22:05.783
- Was that a Dracula impression?
-  Fuck you.

22:08.452 --> 22:10.454
Dickhead.

22:11.622 --> 22:14.625
Okay, so it wasn't
the war, then. -

22:19.922 --> 22:21.590
We moved in '91.

22:21.590 --> 22:22.800
Oh.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.802
My dad was an engineer.

22:24.802 --> 22:27.304
So, what's he doing now?
Is he driving taxis?

22:27.304 --> 22:29.473
No. Now he's dead.

22:30.349 --> 22:31.809
Fuck.

22:31.809 --> 22:33.894
Yeah. Well...

22:42.403 --> 22:44.154
I'm really sorry.

22:44.154 --> 22:47.575
Oh, it's-it's, like, so fine.

22:47.575 --> 22:48.951
I swear.

22:48.951 --> 22:50.744
Yeah.

22:51.745 --> 22:54.164
It's been like five years. More.

22:55.791 --> 22:59.211
I'm just waiting
for my uncle to die now.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.463
We live in his house.

23:02.256 --> 23:04.466
- Is he sick?
- No.

23:04.466 --> 23:06.510
Just...

23:06.510 --> 23:08.053
psycho.

23:10.598 --> 23:13.601
So, would be good
to get rid of him.

23:13.601 --> 23:14.852
Huh?

23:14.852 --> 23:16.937
You want me
to kill someone in return?

23:18.689 --> 23:20.816
Strangers on a Train.

23:20.816 --> 23:23.652
It's also a good movie.

23:26.697 --> 23:29.116
You're one fucked-up unit,
aren't you? -

23:29.116 --> 23:31.118
Just a little.

23:32.328 --> 23:34.079
I approve.

23:35.331 --> 23:37.041
I think.

23:52.723 --> 23:55.934
Was it really the movie
that made you want to move?

23:57.061 --> 23:59.104
You know I do actually
have a postgrad

23:59.104 --> 24:01.023
in linguistics, right?

24:01.023 --> 24:03.567
- Oh.
- And a major in Spanish.

24:03.567 --> 24:06.362
You went
to Melbourne Uni, yeah?

24:06.362 --> 24:07.863
Yeah.

24:07.863 --> 24:10.658
Does that mean you were
a good boy yourself?

24:10.658 --> 24:12.409
- In high school?
- Uh...

24:12.409 --> 24:16.038
I don't know that
that quite describes me.

24:16.038 --> 24:19.249
Jaya said you were, like,
this lone wolf terrorist.

24:19.249 --> 24:21.502
Yeah, it probably had
something to do with the fact

24:21.502 --> 24:26.423
that I, uh, never made
eye contact with humans.

24:29.218 --> 24:31.428
Or the trouble I had

24:31.428 --> 24:33.389
sort of arranging my face

24:33.389 --> 24:36.058
into expressions
that were considered warm.

24:36.058 --> 24:38.268
- Or friendly.

24:38.268 --> 24:40.062
Just non-murderous, really.

24:44.274 --> 24:46.402
Or, for that matter,
just connected to things

24:46.402 --> 24:48.445
I actually felt.

24:49.571 --> 24:51.907
I can at least look forward
to uni, right?

24:51.907 --> 24:53.742
Compared to high school.

24:53.742 --> 24:55.202
Compared to Bogan High, yeah,

24:55.202 --> 24:57.079
you can look forward
to a kidney stone.

25:01.542 --> 25:04.753
I put down Melbourne Uni
as my first preference.

25:04.753 --> 25:06.505
Behavioral science.

25:06.505 --> 25:09.591
Yeah, you'll be fine.
You're obviously a smart kid.

25:11.051 --> 25:13.137
I used to be a smart kid.

25:15.305 --> 25:18.517
When you get to uni, suddenly
everyone's a fucking smart kid.

25:20.853 --> 25:22.896
Why'd you choose Spanish?

25:22.896 --> 25:25.065
Honest truth?

25:26.316 --> 25:28.193
South Americans.

25:29.695 --> 25:32.114
They're just hotter.

25:32.114 --> 25:34.283
- Yeah?
- Mm.

25:35.159 --> 25:36.493
Oh, yeah.

25:36.493 --> 25:38.746
Totally, like what's-her-name.

25:39.788 --> 25:41.623
Gisele.

25:43.208 --> 25:45.085
Mm.

25:53.177 --> 25:54.845
Do you have something else?

25:54.845 --> 25:56.930
Hmm? Yeah, there should be
some stuff back there.

25:56.930 --> 25:58.807
Should be a whole box.

26:03.395 --> 26:05.147
What's all this?

26:05.147 --> 26:07.649
Just all my ex's stuff.

26:07.649 --> 26:09.860
Wound up at my place by mistake.

26:09.860 --> 26:12.821
- Your ex was French?
- Macedonian.

26:12.821 --> 26:15.073
And she liked French music?

26:19.119 --> 26:21.371
Look, you got a bakery.

26:22.331 --> 26:24.124
That's not my spelling.

26:24.124 --> 26:25.918
I'm K-O-L.

26:25.918 --> 26:28.003
Ebony helped me come up
with it, actually.

26:28.003 --> 26:30.339
Oh. Romantic.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.762
K-O-L.

26:38.722 --> 26:40.557
Kol.

26:53.362 --> 26:55.531
Wow. Josef K.

26:55.531 --> 26:57.449
Moved up in life.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.368
Opened a meatworks.

26:59.368 --> 27:00.536
Kafka?

27:00.536 --> 27:02.204
You read Kafka?

27:02.204 --> 27:04.331
What the fuck am I saying?
Of course you read Kafka.

27:04.331 --> 27:06.250
What, did you read The Castle?

27:06.250 --> 27:07.626
The Trial.

27:07.626 --> 27:09.294
Oh.

27:10.045 --> 27:11.713
- Did you like it?
- Yeah.

27:11.713 --> 27:14.132
- Yeah?
- I got a lot out of it.

27:16.802 --> 27:18.929
Favorite book.
Great Expectations.

27:18.929 --> 27:20.806
- Yours?
- Under the Volcano.

27:20.806 --> 27:22.307
I haven't read it.

27:22.307 --> 27:24.518
I'm stunned.

27:24.518 --> 27:26.436
I was expecting an essay.

27:29.857 --> 27:31.775
Boom. The Esplanade.

27:31.775 --> 27:33.193
"Boom. The Esplanade."

27:33.193 --> 27:34.987
Shut up.
Just drive along the beach

27:34.987 --> 27:36.780
and look for an Allenby Street.

27:36.780 --> 27:38.240
And a phone booth.

27:38.240 --> 27:41.743
Did you promise Jaya
your firstborn,

27:41.743 --> 27:43.412
K-O-L Kol?

27:45.122 --> 27:47.624
- Just K-O-L.
- What do I get?

27:48.917 --> 27:51.295
- The next five.
- Wow.

27:51.295 --> 27:53.755
Better get busy.

27:53.755 --> 27:55.883
Stop reading all those books.

27:57.926 --> 28:00.095
You'll have no trouble
with that outfit on.

28:00.095 --> 28:02.890
- You'll start pumping them out.

28:04.808 --> 28:07.561
I'll get right to it.

28:07.561 --> 28:09.354
I hope so.

28:11.273 --> 28:13.233
- Allenby. Allenby.
- Allenby.

28:13.233 --> 28:15.110
- Allenby, Allenby.
- Shut up.

28:15.110 --> 28:17.112
Phone booth.

28:18.280 --> 28:19.781
Is that... Oh, my gosh.

28:21.950 --> 28:23.660
Hey!

28:23.660 --> 28:25.954
- Wake up, princess!
- She's dead.

28:32.294 --> 28:33.754
Look at her.

28:43.388 --> 28:46.808
Your Macedonian ex
is gonna kill me.

28:46.808 --> 28:48.268
Oh, chill.

28:48.268 --> 28:50.520
He won't.

28:58.028 --> 29:00.572
Took you bloody long enough.

29:00.572 --> 29:03.283
Yeah, you're fucking
welcome, you dero.

29:03.283 --> 29:04.618
I'll take this.

29:11.416 --> 29:14.127
Give us some aircon.

29:14.127 --> 29:15.921
Should've dialed Mum
if you wanted aircon.

29:15.921 --> 29:18.131
Going a different route back.
Just keep an eye.

29:18.131 --> 29:20.050
Yeah, cool. No problem, bro.

29:20.050 --> 29:22.344
- Yeah?

29:22.344 --> 29:25.180
Yeah, too easy.
Sweet. Let's do it.

29:25.180 --> 29:26.807
- Yeah, man.
- Just...

29:26.807 --> 29:28.558
Kororoit Creek.

29:28.558 --> 29:29.726
Geelong Road, Dynon.

29:29.726 --> 29:31.603
- Mad as. Done.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.522
Cheers, bro.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.415
Fuck this.

30:13.937 --> 30:16.023
Can we get
a burger or something?

30:16.023 --> 30:18.900
I'm fucking starving.

30:24.489 --> 30:27.200
So, Kol, you got a girlfriend?

30:27.200 --> 30:29.036
No.

30:30.579 --> 30:32.247
You like my sister-- is that it?

30:32.247 --> 30:34.207
Ew.
Ew. No.

30:34.999 --> 30:37.711
I mean, like,
she's hot as-- duh--

30:37.711 --> 30:40.922
but... but we're more like
really good friends.

30:40.922 --> 30:43.175
Yeah, yeah,
I'm, uh... I'm not his type.

30:48.055 --> 30:50.098
Who's your type?

30:50.098 --> 30:51.892
I don't know.

30:52.934 --> 30:54.686
Someone who reads a book.

30:57.814 --> 31:00.317
Someone who's read Borges?

31:00.317 --> 31:02.819
What?

31:02.819 --> 31:05.322
I'll accept Kafka.

31:05.322 --> 31:06.740
Oh, my God,

31:06.740 --> 31:08.700
of course you dudes
love each other,

31:08.700 --> 31:10.786
you fucking nerdoids.

31:17.084 --> 31:19.336
Hey, Eb?
What?

31:19.336 --> 31:22.923
You want to try to swing
past the Civic Centre?

31:22.923 --> 31:27.052
They'd be ready to announce
the winners right about now.

31:28.178 --> 31:30.097
We could go peek in.

31:30.097 --> 31:31.890
Just... clap.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.850
Oh, my fucking God, Nikola.

31:33.850 --> 31:35.477
You're such
a bloody drama queen.

31:35.477 --> 31:37.521
Like, we missed one pissy
gaybo dance competition.

31:37.521 --> 31:39.147
Like, so the hell what?
So the hell what?

31:39.147 --> 31:40.899
Like, who the hell cares?
What are you gonna do now?

31:40.899 --> 31:42.359
Like, crack the shits? God.

31:42.359 --> 31:44.069
Like, there's more important
things in life.

31:44.069 --> 31:46.363
Like, I think you should
probably be a bit more mature

31:46.363 --> 31:47.823
and, like, grow up, maybe.

31:47.823 --> 31:49.491
That is not Lady Macbeth

31:49.491 --> 31:51.368
calling the kettle
a drama queen, Nikola.

31:51.368 --> 31:53.161
Are you fucking dead set?

31:53.161 --> 31:54.704
Suck my dick, homo.

31:54.704 --> 31:56.748
Oof! Oof!

31:56.748 --> 31:58.667
Watch out, NIDA.

31:58.667 --> 32:00.252
Oh, my God, unsex me,

32:00.252 --> 32:01.878
like, here, you gaybo spirits.

32:01.878 --> 32:03.380
Fuck off, Adam.
And fill me,

32:03.380 --> 32:05.132
like, from the crown
full-on to the toe.

32:05.132 --> 32:07.384
- Seriously.

32:07.384 --> 32:09.845
Adam, I'm serious. Cut it out.

32:13.557 --> 32:15.851
Top-full of the, like,
I'm thinking,

32:15.851 --> 32:19.020
- what's your direst cruelty?

32:19.813 --> 32:21.398
She did so well, huh?

32:21.398 --> 32:23.900
You did so well
in that role, Ebony.

32:23.900 --> 32:26.027
I'm so proud of you.

32:30.031 --> 32:31.700
Oh, my God, out, you fag spot!

32:31.700 --> 32:33.827
- Out! Get, like, off of me!

32:36.204 --> 32:37.873
-  What?

32:37.873 --> 32:39.666
Ebony!

32:41.042 --> 32:42.878
Are you for real?

32:42.878 --> 32:44.254
Eb!

32:45.338 --> 32:47.757
Where are you even going?

32:47.757 --> 32:49.467
Eb!

32:51.970 --> 32:53.763
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

32:55.473 --> 32:56.892
No, you're not.

32:56.892 --> 32:59.019
- You guys were right.
- I'm sorry.

32:59.019 --> 33:00.937
You're a grouse actress.

33:00.937 --> 33:02.898
Everyone says so.

33:02.898 --> 33:04.858
- No, they don't.
- Yeah, they do.

33:04.858 --> 33:07.027
You're, like,
the next Nicole Kidman.

33:07.027 --> 33:08.570
She's fucking trash!

33:08.570 --> 33:10.572
All right, I know.
She's trash. She's trash.

33:10.572 --> 33:13.742
You're-you're the next
Cate Blanchett, Eb.

33:13.742 --> 33:16.453
- I didn't get in.
- Of course you'll get in.

33:16.453 --> 33:18.705
No, you're not listening.

33:20.874 --> 33:23.460
I got the letter yesterday.

33:24.336 --> 33:26.171
I didn't get in.

33:28.006 --> 33:29.758
Well, fuck NIDA.

33:29.758 --> 33:31.134
Fuck 'em!

33:31.134 --> 33:33.220
They're cunts,
and they're wrong.

33:33.220 --> 33:35.013
They're wrong.

33:36.014 --> 33:38.308
Fuck Cate Blanchett, too.

33:38.308 --> 33:40.393
You're way better.

33:44.231 --> 33:46.274
- I love you.

33:46.274 --> 33:47.525
Idiot.

33:47.525 --> 33:48.860
Come back to the car.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.362
Fucking car.

33:50.362 --> 33:51.821
Fucking Adam.
He's just fucking...

33:51.821 --> 33:53.615
...like, so nervous,
so me and Kol thought

33:53.615 --> 33:54.950
we'd have like one drink,

33:54.950 --> 33:56.451
just, like,
ease the nerves and stuff.

33:56.451 --> 33:58.078
And then, like, Mum, seriously,
I don't even know

33:58.078 --> 33:59.788
what happened after that.

33:59.788 --> 34:02.040
Like, we literally fell asleep,
and we slept in this morning.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.459
Like, I know, I know. It's...

34:04.459 --> 34:05.961
Oh, my God!

34:05.961 --> 34:07.754
Yeah, well, you never
fucking believe me anyway,

34:07.754 --> 34:09.547
so, like, I don't know...
I don't know why

34:09.547 --> 34:11.967
I expected different from you.
Oh, my God.

34:13.635 --> 34:16.930
Yeah, we had drinks
'cause we were so nervous.

34:16.930 --> 34:18.974
Because it's the finals.

34:23.645 --> 34:25.021
Yeah, and then we slept in,
and, like,

34:25.021 --> 34:26.606
I don't even know
what happened after that.

34:26.606 --> 34:28.316
Like, literally, oh, my God,
Mum, when we woke up,

34:28.316 --> 34:30.527
we, like, freaked out. I swear.

34:43.873 --> 34:45.959
Wait!

34:45.959 --> 34:47.794
Wait, you're actually insane.

34:47.794 --> 34:50.255
Like, you're actually insane,
and I can't fucking stand it.

34:50.255 --> 34:51.840
Yeah, I'm not...
No, not engaging.

34:51.840 --> 34:53.216
Not engaging.

35:06.938 --> 35:09.399
How'd Fay take it?

35:09.399 --> 35:11.276
Just drive.

35:30.045 --> 35:32.339
51.

35:32.339 --> 35:34.841
When did Greensborough
get so full of wogs?

35:34.841 --> 35:37.677
- Jesus.
- I know, right?

35:38.553 --> 35:40.180
Actually, um, you should

35:40.180 --> 35:41.848
call your mum
about the Civic Centre.

35:41.848 --> 35:43.933
Oh, she wasn't coming today.

35:43.933 --> 35:46.603
It's a shame she doesn't,
like, support you.

35:47.437 --> 35:49.606
She works three jobs.

35:49.606 --> 35:52.609
We're a planet away
from the people she loves.

35:52.609 --> 35:54.986
I'd call that supporting me.

35:59.282 --> 36:01.868
53.

36:01.868 --> 36:03.620
- Sorry.
- See ya.

36:03.620 --> 36:06.164
49. 49.

36:09.584 --> 36:12.212
Donegal.

36:12.212 --> 36:14.047
Adam Donegal.

36:14.047 --> 36:15.382
Mate.

36:16.091 --> 36:18.134
You don't recognize me?

36:18.134 --> 36:20.512
Travis Mellor.

36:20.512 --> 36:22.138
Where have you been hiding?

36:22.138 --> 36:23.264
What?

36:23.264 --> 36:24.265
Who, me?

36:24.265 --> 36:25.558
I meant your brother.

36:25.558 --> 36:27.560
But hi. I'm Mellor.

36:27.560 --> 36:29.521
Hi. I'm Ebony.

36:29.521 --> 36:30.814
Didn't recognize you.

36:30.814 --> 36:33.149
No shit. I've been working out.

36:33.149 --> 36:34.484
Oh, okay.

36:34.484 --> 36:35.819
I don't think that's why.

36:35.819 --> 36:37.779
Are you coming later?

36:37.779 --> 36:40.115
Coming where?
- Boon-Dog's 21st.

36:40.115 --> 36:41.783
Boon-Dog?

36:41.783 --> 36:43.451
What's a Boon-Dog?

36:43.451 --> 36:45.662
"What's a Boon-Dog?" This guy.

36:45.662 --> 36:47.956
School together for six years,
and now he's all like--

36:47.956 --> 36:50.125
- I don't know. Too good for us?
Yeah.

36:50.125 --> 36:52.877
Yeah, don't think any of us
want to remember Watsonia High.

36:52.877 --> 36:54.504
Fucking oath.
- Mm.

36:54.504 --> 36:55.922
Hey, you might know
Boon-Dog's sister.

36:55.922 --> 36:57.132
- I mean fiancée.
Oh.

36:57.132 --> 36:58.591
- Coral. Yeah.
- Coral Birch?

36:58.591 --> 37:00.051
- It's at their house, the party.
- Oh.

37:00.051 --> 37:01.511
Hey, you should come.
- Oh, mad as.

37:01.511 --> 37:03.012
We should. We should!

37:03.012 --> 37:04.722
She's, like, right up the road
from Tari's,

37:04.722 --> 37:06.266
behind the, um, Video Ezy, yeah?

37:06.266 --> 37:09.144
- Yeah, behind the Video Ezy.
- Yeah. Yeah.

37:09.144 --> 37:11.104
- Oh, my God, we should.
Yeah.

37:11.104 --> 37:13.189
Um, is it, like, themed or...

37:13.189 --> 37:15.108
- It's bring your own STD.
Uh...

37:15.108 --> 37:17.026
Yeah, yeah, nah, nah.

37:17.026 --> 37:19.904
I don't know, not a very
creative bunch, um...

37:19.904 --> 37:21.322
Hmm?
I don't know.

37:21.322 --> 37:23.199
You should just wear
what you're wearing.

37:23.199 --> 37:25.034
Oh. Yeah, sick as.

37:25.034 --> 37:27.495
Yeah. -Right,
so we'll see you tonight.

37:27.495 --> 37:29.956
In the house. Righto.

37:29.956 --> 37:31.499
Catch you later, Donegal.

37:31.499 --> 37:33.334
- Catch youse then.
- See ya.

37:34.169 --> 37:35.795
Bye.

37:36.671 --> 37:38.298
Sick as, bro.

37:40.425 --> 37:41.718
In the house.

37:41.718 --> 37:44.721
Coral Birch is
a fucking mole, but...

37:44.721 --> 37:46.514
we're going to that party.

37:46.514 --> 37:48.558
No, you're not.

37:48.558 --> 37:50.143
Excuse me. I was invited.

37:50.143 --> 37:52.228
Yeah, well, I'm not.

37:52.228 --> 37:53.730
Well, I'm not.

37:53.730 --> 37:55.440
My name's Adam, and I'm a loser.

37:55.440 --> 37:57.817
I love you.

38:03.490 --> 38:05.158
Come on.

38:06.993 --> 38:08.536
Go.

38:10.371 --> 38:11.873
Oh. Hi.

38:11.873 --> 38:13.708
Fay. Hi.

38:13.708 --> 38:14.876
How are you?

38:14.876 --> 38:16.377
Dining room. Now.

38:16.377 --> 38:17.795
Good to see you.

38:23.927 --> 38:26.095
Do you understand what it takes?

38:26.095 --> 38:27.931
- All of this?
- Shh.

38:27.931 --> 38:29.599
Do you understand what it takes?

38:29.599 --> 38:31.392
I don't understand
what I've done. -

38:31.392 --> 38:32.769
I do not understand
what I've done.

38:32.769 --> 38:34.103
Nights out with boys
is the story.

38:34.103 --> 38:35.271
I was...
I was not out with boys.

38:35.271 --> 38:37.148
I was with Kol. Kol is not boys.

38:37.148 --> 38:38.942
Do you know
what I have to go through

38:38.942 --> 38:40.860
- to contribute to this house?
- What about what I contribute

38:40.860 --> 38:42.237
to this household?
What about that?

38:42.237 --> 38:43.571
You're actually
so disrespectful.

38:43.571 --> 38:45.073
I turn up at the Civic Centre,

38:45.073 --> 38:46.366
and they say you're not there.

38:46.366 --> 38:48.076
What am I...
what am I meant to think?

38:48.076 --> 38:49.536
I was with Kol!

38:49.536 --> 38:51.371
Oh, my God, okay,
you're really pissing me off.

38:51.371 --> 38:53.081
All night? -EBONY: Like,
I'm actually about to lose it,

38:53.081 --> 38:54.874
so, like, can you stop, like,
hovering around me,

38:54.874 --> 38:56.626
and maybe you just take a big
step back. -FAY: Excuse me.

38:56.626 --> 38:58.586
- I can't believe that.
- And then you just go on.

38:58.586 --> 39:00.004
That's not the case.

39:00.004 --> 39:01.297
Oh, my God!
Look, it's not.

40:26.132 --> 40:27.634
- So I'm grounded?
- Surely that's your obligation.

40:27.634 --> 40:29.260
The money I spent
on those dancing classes!

40:29.260 --> 40:31.596
That wasn't my fault!
That was not my fault.

40:35.808 --> 40:37.894
Hey.

40:40.229 --> 40:41.356
Hey.

40:41.356 --> 40:43.566
- Oh, sorry.

40:47.695 --> 40:51.157
I think my sister
wants her room back.

40:52.075 --> 40:53.785
- Shit.
- That's okay.

40:53.785 --> 40:55.953
- I'm so sorry.
- We're all good.

40:58.498 --> 41:00.708
You hungry?

41:00.708 --> 41:02.627
What time is it?

41:02.627 --> 41:05.129
It's dinnertime.

41:07.048 --> 41:10.510
Think you're gonna need
another shirt, though.

41:12.303 --> 41:14.430
Wha...

41:14.430 --> 41:16.307
What's going on?

41:17.725 --> 41:20.478
Uh, it's my going-away dinner.

41:25.942 --> 41:27.485
Come on.

41:31.531 --> 41:33.032
Are you okay?

41:33.032 --> 41:35.118
Yeah. I'm okay.

41:57.640 --> 42:01.477
You can wear this and this.

42:23.332 --> 42:25.626
♪ But I still can't believe... ♪

42:25.626 --> 42:28.045
Who's this?

42:28.045 --> 42:29.839
Tori Amos.

42:31.466 --> 42:34.343
Is she one of those gay divas?

42:35.845 --> 42:38.055
No. She fucks men.

42:39.098 --> 42:41.017
No, I mean...

42:41.017 --> 42:43.644
like, you know, Madonna

42:43.644 --> 42:46.856
or, like,
Barbra Streisand or whatever.

42:49.650 --> 42:54.363
Tori Amos is definitely not
Barbra Streisand.

42:54.363 --> 42:56.616
Okay. Sorry.

42:56.616 --> 42:58.534
No, it's okay.

43:02.663 --> 43:05.833
Hey, just so you know...

43:07.210 --> 43:09.212
...I'm open-minded.

43:10.087 --> 43:13.674
Like, it's totally okay.

43:14.592 --> 43:16.511
To be gay, you know.

43:20.890 --> 43:22.517
What?

43:23.434 --> 43:25.228
No, nothing.

43:39.534 --> 43:41.536
Is it on Napster?

43:43.162 --> 43:44.997
What's the album?

43:45.748 --> 43:48.876
It's not an album.
It's a B side.

43:50.503 --> 43:52.004
Cool.

44:00.096 --> 44:01.889
Here.

44:04.851 --> 44:07.562
T-shirts I was gonna throw out.

44:10.606 --> 44:12.233
Thanks.

44:17.029 --> 44:18.656
Come on.

45:21.928 --> 45:24.931
23. Just up ahead.

45:32.897 --> 45:35.650
When did you drop off the tapes?

45:35.650 --> 45:39.904
When you were...
sleeping, beauty.

45:54.251 --> 45:57.338
Just, you can keep it.

45:57.338 --> 45:59.757
Goran's not gonna miss it.

46:11.894 --> 46:14.063
He, uh...

46:15.022 --> 46:17.191
He was a Goran?

46:17.191 --> 46:18.651
Ugh.

46:22.863 --> 46:24.573
He was a...

46:25.449 --> 46:27.618
He was an architect.

46:28.536 --> 46:30.579
But, yeah, he was a Goran.

46:36.252 --> 46:37.795
It's my cousin's name.

46:37.795 --> 46:39.296
Really?

46:39.296 --> 46:41.215
Is he Maco?

46:41.215 --> 46:42.383
Serbian.

46:42.383 --> 46:43.634
Right.

46:43.634 --> 46:45.511
I'm three things.

46:45.511 --> 46:49.223
Serbian, Bosnian, Yugoslav.

46:49.223 --> 46:51.017
Yugoslav?

46:53.227 --> 46:54.770
How does that even work?

46:54.770 --> 46:56.897
Think I'm gonna lay out
my political vicissitudes

46:56.897 --> 46:58.649
in like 45 seconds?

46:58.649 --> 47:00.818
Vicissitudes!

47:01.736 --> 47:03.446
Vicissitudes.

47:03.446 --> 47:06.323
Do you look up the big words
in the dictionary

47:06.323 --> 47:08.743
and then you practice saying
them in front of the mirror?

47:08.743 --> 47:09.952
-  No.
- Yeah, you do.

47:09.952 --> 47:11.412
You do, don't you?

47:13.205 --> 47:15.332
Vicissitudes.

47:21.547 --> 47:23.132
All right.

47:27.428 --> 47:30.014
Mr. Nikola Denic.

47:32.475 --> 47:34.727
It's been fascinating.

47:34.727 --> 47:36.604
Been a pleasure.

47:44.779 --> 47:47.782
You maybe have, like,
email or something?

47:47.782 --> 47:49.075
Mm.

47:49.075 --> 47:51.285
It's, uh...

47:51.285 --> 47:53.788
"why can't Adam read"
at Hotmail.

47:54.580 --> 47:58.209
I'll get, um, Ebony
to pass it on.

48:02.505 --> 48:04.215
I doubt there's gonna be
any dial-up

48:04.215 --> 48:05.800
where I'm living, though.

48:08.094 --> 48:09.887
Oh, okay.

48:11.806 --> 48:13.516
Yeah.

48:13.516 --> 48:14.934
Well...

48:17.603 --> 48:20.773
It was really nice to...

48:22.024 --> 48:23.901
...meet you.

48:24.860 --> 48:26.320
I guess.

48:26.320 --> 48:27.947
I know.

48:27.947 --> 48:29.907
Not "I guess."

48:31.492 --> 48:32.701
Yeah.

48:32.701 --> 48:35.037
And, uh...

48:35.037 --> 48:37.706
have a safe and...

48:37.706 --> 48:40.584
you know, cool PhD.

48:43.170 --> 48:45.756
And, uh, yeah.

48:47.424 --> 48:49.468
Yeah.

48:54.223 --> 48:56.183
Okay.

48:58.060 --> 48:59.895
- Okay.

48:59.895 --> 49:01.313
Bye.

49:21.917 --> 49:24.003
Ah, here's Kolya.

49:25.129 --> 49:27.006
Come, darl.

49:28.215 --> 49:29.842
Come grab a roll.
- There he is!

49:30.092 --> 49:32.553
I just ate, I was
in a restaurant.

49:32.553 --> 49:34.930
Just in time for the soccer!

49:34.930 --> 49:38.517
Aw he's never been much for
the soccer. Even when tiny...

49:38.517 --> 49:42.146
Always quiet in his corner, with
his books, his picture books...

49:42.146 --> 49:45.232
He was a boy then.
Should be a man now.

49:45.232 --> 49:48.652
You wanna be careful.
Too many books and well,
you know how it goes.

49:48.652 --> 49:54.408
Try tell his donkey-headed mum
upstairs. - Leave him alone.

49:54.950 --> 49:59.872
But look at him. What's
with the get-up? Getting a
bit up ourselves, are we?

50:00.289 --> 50:03.459
We went to a restaurant too.
The winter just gone.

50:03.459 --> 50:04.835
- And it was nice?
- So-so. For those pr-...

50:04.835 --> 50:08.756
It's good for a man's
blood, a bit of soccer. -
You can see he needs it, man!

50:08.756 --> 50:10.925
- Sit here, bud!
- Be right back.

50:35.449 --> 50:36.116
Hey.

50:36.617 --> 50:38.744
I need this okay?

50:40.162 --> 50:42.790
Did you buy this shirt?
Long story.

50:42.790 --> 50:45.000
How'd we go at the dance?

52:00.909 --> 52:03.120
What, what, what, what is it?

52:03.120 --> 52:04.705
It's Ebony.

52:07.583 --> 52:09.043
What? What now?

52:09.043 --> 52:10.753
Thank fuck.
I said you'd be in bed.

52:10.753 --> 52:12.546
I'm at Coral's. Come.

52:12.546 --> 52:14.631
- What?
- Get off.

52:14.631 --> 52:16.050
What?

52:16.050 --> 52:17.843
- Aren't you grounded?
- I snuck out, you dildo.

52:17.843 --> 52:19.928
What are they gonna do,
ground me some more?

52:19.928 --> 52:21.555
See you in a bit.

52:57.883 --> 53:00.094
Coral.

53:00.094 --> 53:02.179
Someone's spewed
on your doormat.

53:05.182 --> 53:07.059
Coral, hi.

53:07.059 --> 53:09.311
Uh, hi.

53:09.311 --> 53:10.687
I guess.

53:10.687 --> 53:13.023
Nikola.
I was with you in home ec.

53:13.023 --> 53:14.817
Friends with Ebony.

53:16.068 --> 53:18.821
She's around, yeah? Eb?

53:46.682 --> 53:48.308
Oi, you dingbat!

53:48.308 --> 53:50.269
- Took you bloody long enough.
- What?

53:50.269 --> 53:51.937
Oh, my God, Tari thinks she saw

53:51.937 --> 53:54.022
this cute guy
somewhere in this bit,

53:54.022 --> 53:55.732
so I was, like, looking for him.

53:55.732 --> 53:57.025
Here I am.

53:57.025 --> 53:59.027
What? No. This, like, white guy.

53:59.027 --> 54:01.238
- Mm-hmm, here I am.
- What? No.

54:01.238 --> 54:02.990
I meant, like, Aussie.

54:02.990 --> 54:05.909
Oh, so not, like, Nicaraguan.

54:05.909 --> 54:08.245
Let's look for him
together, Kolly.

54:08.245 --> 54:09.788
How'd you sneak out?

54:09.788 --> 54:12.124
Adam covered for me.

54:12.124 --> 54:14.418
Please, bogans. Thank you.

54:14.418 --> 54:17.921
I swear, this guy that Tari saw,
if it's the guy I think it is,

54:17.921 --> 54:20.424
it's gonna make up for,
like, the year.

54:20.424 --> 54:22.176
Hey, actually, I think
I'm gonna bail. -Fucking hell.

54:22.176 --> 54:23.927
Oh, my God! Oh, my God,
it's him, it's him, it's him.

54:23.927 --> 54:25.554
Who are we talking about?

54:25.554 --> 54:27.806
Oh, my God,
I'm so nervous! Oh, my God.

54:27.806 --> 54:29.683
- Hey.
Hey, Eb.

54:29.683 --> 54:31.685
This is Brayden.

54:31.685 --> 54:32.769
Hi.

54:32.769 --> 54:34.396
Hi. I'm Ebony.

54:34.396 --> 54:36.523
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

54:36.523 --> 54:38.567
Got you a milk and Baileys.

54:38.567 --> 54:39.860
Oh, my God.

54:39.860 --> 54:41.904
I think we saw you
at, uh, Samara's?

54:41.904 --> 54:43.906
Oh, yeah, yeah. At muck-up week.

54:43.906 --> 54:45.491
I didn't know what was going on.

54:45.491 --> 54:47.034
Is that a Tamagotchi?

54:47.034 --> 54:49.119
- Have you killed it?
Right. Yeah.

54:49.119 --> 54:51.205
She was, like,
the worst thing ever.

54:51.205 --> 54:53.290
- She was, like, fucking feral.
Oh, my God.

54:55.042 --> 54:56.752
Hey.

54:59.213 --> 55:00.631
Man of the moment.

55:00.631 --> 55:02.382
- Come here.
Oh, my God.

55:02.382 --> 55:04.676
Come here.
No way.

55:04.676 --> 55:05.719
You came!

55:05.719 --> 55:08.430
I need to give you a big hug.

55:08.430 --> 55:10.015
Here.
Hi!

55:10.015 --> 55:12.768
Oh, my gosh,
you haven't given me a hug.

55:12.768 --> 55:14.937
Come on.

55:14.937 --> 55:18.148
Oh, I reckon...
I reckon I'm gonna give you

55:18.148 --> 55:19.483
a long-distance hug.

55:19.483 --> 55:21.735
That's what I'm gonna do.
Like this.

55:23.028 --> 55:24.863
I didn't know
you two were friends.

55:24.863 --> 55:27.115
Oh, yeah, this wanker's
pretending like we're not.

55:27.115 --> 55:29.243
But, like, we were pretty much
like boyfriend-girlfriend.

55:29.243 --> 55:31.245
No.
- Your bloody girlfriend.

55:31.245 --> 55:33.121
You're just playing with me.
I know it.

55:33.121 --> 55:34.581
I know that's what you're doing.

55:34.581 --> 55:36.041
Yeah, I don't know
what you're talking about.

55:36.041 --> 55:37.793
Oh! What's... Okay. All right.

55:37.793 --> 55:38.919
Oh, my God.

55:38.919 --> 55:40.587
Dig the T-shirt. Looks good.

55:41.380 --> 55:43.173
Do you know what I need to see?

55:43.173 --> 55:44.967
- Hmm?
- I need to see this boy stoned.

55:46.843 --> 55:48.470
Nah.
- I need to see it!

55:48.470 --> 55:49.972
I need to see it.

55:49.972 --> 55:52.474
Oh, my God, Loredana, get
your fat ass off of that couch

55:52.474 --> 55:54.226
and go get this boy a bong!

55:55.018 --> 55:57.145
Quick, quick, quick, quick!
This is serious!

55:57.145 --> 55:59.106
Don't fucking
touch me with your spastic

55:59.106 --> 56:00.983
- fucking shoes.
Oh, my-- Okay.

56:00.983 --> 56:02.776
How you doing?
- Don't hit me, Adam.

56:02.776 --> 56:04.945
- Fucking hell.
It's okay.

56:04.945 --> 56:06.530
He's just... he's...

56:06.530 --> 56:08.115
Why are you in here?

56:08.115 --> 56:10.909
Hey! There we go!
Very good. Very good.

56:10.909 --> 56:12.411
Nicely done.

56:13.203 --> 56:15.289
Yeah, well,
it's good for mental health

56:15.289 --> 56:17.958
because what it does,
it relaxes you.

56:17.958 --> 56:19.459
- It's true.
- What do I do?

56:19.459 --> 56:21.378
Oh, my God, no way.
"What do I do?"

56:21.378 --> 56:24.047
"What do I do?"

56:24.047 --> 56:25.382
You're the best.

56:25.382 --> 56:27.050
Is he?
Yeah, the best.

56:27.050 --> 56:28.343
- The best?
- He's so cute!

56:28.343 --> 56:29.845
I think this'll be
perfect for him,

56:29.845 --> 56:31.346
for his mental health,
for his clarity,

56:31.346 --> 56:32.889
- for his well-being.
He wants to know.

56:32.889 --> 56:34.683
- Let's do it. Let's do it, baby.
Go, Kol.

56:34.683 --> 56:36.351
- All right, inhale.
Go, Kolly.

56:36.351 --> 56:38.312
I don't think he's ever
actually kissed a girl.

56:38.312 --> 56:40.063
Yeah. Never.

56:43.692 --> 56:44.943
Yowza!

56:44.943 --> 56:46.945
Oh!

56:50.991 --> 56:53.035
- You good?

56:53.035 --> 56:54.494
Yeah, that's a bit dramatic.

56:54.494 --> 56:55.871
- It's not working.
It's not working?

56:55.871 --> 56:57.748
Excuse me,
the weed isn't working?

56:57.748 --> 56:59.333
How's that Coral,
don't you reckon?

56:59.333 --> 57:01.418
Who's that?
- Oh, haven't you met Coral?

57:01.418 --> 57:03.503
Oh, she's, like,
this massive bitch,

57:03.503 --> 57:04.880
but she's actually kind of nice.

57:04.880 --> 57:06.465
- Oh, okay. Oh, yeah.
- Actually, yeah, yeah.

57:06.465 --> 57:08.467
- I reckon you'd like her, yeah.
- I don't know if I would.

57:08.467 --> 57:09.718
She sounds like a bitch.

57:51.635 --> 57:52.928
Spaz.

57:52.928 --> 57:54.346
Sorry.

57:55.972 --> 57:57.265
Coral.

58:00.727 --> 58:02.145
Sorry.

58:07.067 --> 58:09.194
I-Is, um...

58:11.571 --> 58:13.782
Is Adam here?

58:15.701 --> 58:18.078
Are you shitting me?

58:18.078 --> 58:20.539
It's-it's Ebony's brother.

58:21.498 --> 58:23.750
Get the fuck out of my house.

58:23.750 --> 58:25.085
Yeah, you tell him.

58:25.085 --> 58:28.046
Back to fucking
"Czecho-souvlaki-a."

58:34.469 --> 58:37.013
The fuck you staring at, babe?

58:37.013 --> 58:39.266
You want me to get my fiancé?

58:40.225 --> 58:42.477
He'd love to smash your face.

58:48.859 --> 58:50.986
Fucking homo.

59:08.879 --> 59:10.338
Hey.

59:10.338 --> 59:12.382
I swear, I leave you alone
for like five seconds.

59:12.382 --> 59:13.884
What are you doing?

59:16.011 --> 59:18.388
Jump in.

59:20.015 --> 59:22.392
I went to take a leak,
and you were gone.

59:22.392 --> 59:24.728
- You all right?
- Yeah.

59:40.911 --> 59:43.163
It was a grouse party, eh?

59:45.290 --> 59:47.459
What, are you kidding?

59:49.461 --> 59:52.088
I-I wouldn't know.

59:52.088 --> 59:53.632
I guess.

59:57.093 --> 59:59.638
23.

1:00:04.100 --> 1:00:06.019
Where's Ebony?

1:00:06.019 --> 1:00:09.147
I imagine not asking herself
where you are.

1:00:14.069 --> 1:00:16.404
You promise me one thing?

1:00:17.864 --> 1:00:21.952
That my sister, can you just...
just cut her.

1:00:22.994 --> 1:00:25.080
First chance you get.

1:00:28.041 --> 1:00:30.544
I'm not being a dick.

1:00:30.544 --> 1:00:32.337
Yeah?

1:00:33.380 --> 1:00:35.507
You deserve better friends.

1:00:38.093 --> 1:00:40.303
Guy like you, much better.

1:00:43.181 --> 1:00:45.016
I love Ebony.

1:00:47.102 --> 1:00:50.689
Not, like, love-love, obviously.

1:00:53.191 --> 1:00:55.861
Just, like a friend, I mean.

1:00:57.070 --> 1:00:58.613
Fucking hell.

1:00:58.613 --> 1:01:02.158
I-I know she can be,
like, a mess, but...

1:01:03.451 --> 1:01:05.579
...deep down...

1:01:06.746 --> 1:01:08.748
I think she brought me
out here tonight

1:01:08.748 --> 1:01:11.001
to-to say that she's sorry.

1:01:12.586 --> 1:01:15.964
She brought you out tonight
'cause I told her to call you.

1:01:21.303 --> 1:01:23.513
I don't really have any other...

1:01:25.473 --> 1:01:28.685
N-Not... not many other friends.

1:01:35.317 --> 1:01:37.485
Don't tell her I said that.

1:01:44.743 --> 1:01:46.411
S-Sorry.

1:01:47.495 --> 1:01:50.248
You probably just
want to get to bed.

1:01:55.211 --> 1:01:57.505
Actually, I was gonna
go for a drive.

1:02:08.058 --> 1:02:10.060
Can I come?

1:02:26.159 --> 1:02:29.079
Your sister never told me.

1:02:29.079 --> 1:02:31.498
About you.

1:02:32.332 --> 1:02:34.626
About me what?

1:02:34.626 --> 1:02:36.294
That I'm a linguist?

1:02:36.294 --> 1:02:37.879
No, that you're...

1:02:38.964 --> 1:02:40.507
You know.

1:02:41.925 --> 1:02:44.094
A sodomite?

1:02:49.265 --> 1:02:51.476
Were you, like, openly...

1:02:52.560 --> 1:02:54.187
In high school?

1:02:54.187 --> 1:02:56.398
What, at Watsonia High?

1:02:57.524 --> 1:02:59.567
Are you fucking kidding?

1:03:04.739 --> 1:03:08.159
Why? Did you have an openly
gay guy the last couple years?

1:03:08.159 --> 1:03:09.744
No.

1:03:09.744 --> 1:03:11.746
Everyone was straight, then.

1:03:14.165 --> 1:03:17.836
What's that--
it'd be 900 students.

1:03:19.254 --> 1:03:22.090
All upstanding heterosexuals?

1:03:23.091 --> 1:03:25.093
Every last one?

1:03:30.765 --> 1:03:32.642
I lied before.

1:03:36.229 --> 1:03:38.231
About Kafka.

1:03:39.566 --> 1:03:42.152
I did read The Trial, but...

1:03:44.070 --> 1:03:46.281
I could barely follow it.

1:03:53.329 --> 1:03:55.290
What about Borges?

1:03:57.584 --> 1:03:59.502
I'm trying.

1:04:00.920 --> 1:04:03.757
I don't really know what's
going on most of the time.

1:04:08.261 --> 1:04:10.305
What about the Balkans?

1:04:11.806 --> 1:04:14.434
Was your mum
actually born in Altona?

1:04:15.727 --> 1:04:18.438
The Balkan part was true.

1:04:18.438 --> 1:04:19.981
Alas.

1:04:31.743 --> 1:04:33.953
There anything else?

1:04:35.914 --> 1:04:38.249
That you've maybe
been lying about?

1:07:56.155 --> 1:07:58.074
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1:08:06.332 --> 1:08:08.835
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1:08:11.170 --> 1:08:13.381
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1:08:13.381 --> 1:08:15.717
It's okay. It's okay.

1:08:15.717 --> 1:08:17.302
I'm okay.

1:08:17.302 --> 1:08:19.387
- Hmm?
- I can come again.

1:08:23.725 --> 1:08:25.560
You will.

1:08:53.838 --> 1:08:55.882
You turned up for me.

1:09:24.243 --> 1:09:26.662
How long does a PhD take?

1:09:32.543 --> 1:09:34.253
Sorry.

1:09:34.253 --> 1:09:36.381
It's a dumb question.

1:09:37.298 --> 1:09:39.801
No, it's not a dumb question.

1:09:39.801 --> 1:09:41.386
At all.

1:09:48.976 --> 1:09:51.229
Can I walk you to your door?

1:09:54.816 --> 1:09:56.651
It's...

1:09:56.651 --> 1:10:00.196
It's my uncle and stuff.

1:10:01.614 --> 1:10:03.783
It's okay.
You don't need to explain.

1:10:03.783 --> 1:10:05.618
It's fine.

1:10:18.047 --> 1:10:20.174
Oh, shit.

1:10:25.179 --> 1:10:27.557
Promise me you'll meet someone.

1:10:28.808 --> 1:10:30.435
Yeah?

1:10:31.519 --> 1:10:33.479
You beautiful boy.

1:12:02.902 --> 1:12:06.197
by Rodrigo Leão playing)

1:12:30.429 --> 1:12:32.306
Easy.

1:13:02.628 --> 1:13:04.714
What are the odds, eh?

1:13:04.714 --> 1:13:06.299
We'd both be arriving right now?

1:13:06.299 --> 1:13:08.175
A few weeks ago,
I would've said low.

1:13:08.175 --> 1:13:12.138
But in the middle of this
Icelandic volcano apocalypse,

1:13:12.138 --> 1:13:13.681
I'd say pretty high.

1:13:13.681 --> 1:13:15.766
How many times
your flight get canceled?

1:13:15.766 --> 1:13:18.060
Twice. What about you?

1:13:20.271 --> 1:13:22.481
They had me on a 22-hour,

1:13:22.481 --> 1:13:25.151
then a 26-hour,

1:13:25.151 --> 1:13:27.528
then finally a 42-hour.

1:13:27.528 --> 1:13:29.030
- So you were lucky.
- Mm-hmm.

1:13:29.030 --> 1:13:30.448
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

1:13:30.448 --> 1:13:32.533
- I smell like it, too.
- Yeah, I noticed.

1:13:34.285 --> 1:13:36.078
Oh, God.

1:13:47.465 --> 1:13:50.468
Melbourne, eh?

1:13:51.719 --> 1:13:53.763
You don't miss it?

1:13:53.763 --> 1:13:55.473
No.

1:13:57.266 --> 1:13:59.727
But it's home, alas.

1:14:02.730 --> 1:14:04.940
I remember growing up,

1:14:04.940 --> 1:14:07.318
I was convinced
I'd travel the world.

1:14:09.028 --> 1:14:11.030
Have all these adventures.

1:14:11.030 --> 1:14:13.741
Just meet these
mind-blowing people.

1:14:14.867 --> 1:14:16.243
Connect.

1:14:21.165 --> 1:14:23.125
Fuck. Sorry.

1:14:23.125 --> 1:14:25.044
What?

1:14:25.044 --> 1:14:28.881
What's it been,
four minutes since we sat down?

1:14:28.881 --> 1:14:31.342
Already, Nikola's gone
all wanks-istential.

1:14:35.096 --> 1:14:37.765
Yeah, but that's
what's great about you.

1:14:39.767 --> 1:14:42.061
No, it's good.
It's good it hasn't changed.

1:14:45.940 --> 1:14:48.150
Everything else has.

1:14:48.150 --> 1:14:50.194
I'm a bitter old man these days.

1:14:50.194 --> 1:14:51.696
Shut up.

1:14:53.781 --> 1:14:57.243
A twink called me gay-fat
on Saturday. -

1:14:57.243 --> 1:14:59.078
What the fuck?

1:14:59.078 --> 1:15:00.746
Gay-fat?

1:15:00.746 --> 1:15:02.415
Apparently.

1:15:02.415 --> 1:15:04.333
Mm.

1:15:05.418 --> 1:15:08.087
You know, I wasn't gonna
say anything, but...

1:15:08.087 --> 1:15:09.964
I was kind of thinking
the same thing

1:15:09.964 --> 1:15:12.091
when I saw you at baggage claim.

1:15:12.091 --> 1:15:15.594
Change the subject, motherfucker.

1:15:15.594 --> 1:15:17.388
Tell me about you.

1:15:17.388 --> 1:15:19.724
Still in Buenos Aires?

1:15:19.724 --> 1:15:22.977
All I know is you're
one of those übercool people

1:15:22.977 --> 1:15:26.272
who doesn't have a Facebook
or Twitter or anything.

1:15:28.941 --> 1:15:30.401
No, I'm in Guatemala.

1:15:30.401 --> 1:15:31.944
- Of course you are.
- Yeah.

1:15:31.944 --> 1:15:35.156
With an aid organization.

1:15:35.156 --> 1:15:37.491
The volcano canceled flights
from Guatemala?

1:15:37.491 --> 1:15:40.578
No, I flew in from Switzerland.

1:15:40.578 --> 1:15:43.122
Yeah. I was up there
for a conference.

1:15:43.122 --> 1:15:44.915
Fancy.

1:15:46.459 --> 1:15:49.754
They put us up in
a $3,000-a-night ski resort

1:15:49.754 --> 1:15:52.298
so we could discuss ways
on how to fix poor people.

1:15:53.591 --> 1:15:54.717
Did you fix them?

1:15:54.717 --> 1:15:56.469
Yeah. Yeah, all fixed.

1:15:58.053 --> 1:16:00.055
- Sure.
- Yep.

1:16:00.931 --> 1:16:02.725
So you've been feeling filthy
since the flight.

1:16:02.725 --> 1:16:05.186
I've been feeling filthy
since Switzerland, so...

1:16:09.231 --> 1:16:12.443
What about you? What are you
doing for pocket money?

1:16:13.903 --> 1:16:16.363
Public health research.

1:16:16.363 --> 1:16:18.157
At Bristol Uni.

1:16:18.157 --> 1:16:19.617
England.

1:16:19.617 --> 1:16:21.911
Mm-hmm.

1:16:21.911 --> 1:16:23.621
What?

1:16:25.331 --> 1:16:27.833
How are you still friends
with my sister?

1:16:27.833 --> 1:16:29.585
Oh.

1:16:30.503 --> 1:16:32.922
I'm basically not.

1:16:32.922 --> 1:16:35.800
Don't think we've
properly spoken in five,

1:16:35.800 --> 1:16:37.968
maybe six years.

1:16:37.968 --> 1:16:41.347
But you flew 37 hours...

1:16:41.347 --> 1:16:45.184
through volcanic ash for Ebony.

1:16:46.101 --> 1:16:47.895
Well...

1:16:47.895 --> 1:16:51.440
there's people here I haven't
seen in ages, you know.

1:16:52.274 --> 1:16:54.109
It was a good chance.

1:16:58.572 --> 1:17:01.659
So, where are you staying?
Your mum's?

1:17:01.659 --> 1:17:03.244
She's in Bendigo now.

1:17:03.244 --> 1:17:05.621
- Oh, yeah?
- With my brother.

1:17:05.621 --> 1:17:07.540
Yeah, he has a job there.

1:17:07.540 --> 1:17:09.333
And a newborn.

1:17:09.333 --> 1:17:12.294
- Far out.
- The whole shebang.

1:17:12.294 --> 1:17:14.129
- I'll be heading over.
- Yeah.

1:17:14.129 --> 1:17:15.923
In a few days.

1:17:17.091 --> 1:17:19.260
So you're gonna stay
at your uncle's till then?

1:17:19.260 --> 1:17:20.761
Good God, no.

1:17:20.761 --> 1:17:23.514
Those people don't
talk to me anymore.

1:17:23.514 --> 1:17:25.683
They don't even talk to Mum.

1:17:25.683 --> 1:17:26.767
What happened?

1:17:26.767 --> 1:17:29.478
They found out I fuck boys.

1:17:30.980 --> 1:17:33.399
Bit of a deal breaker.

1:17:36.360 --> 1:17:37.903
So, where you staying?

1:17:37.903 --> 1:17:39.947
Bundoora Parkview.

1:17:39.947 --> 1:17:41.615
You didn't have to get a hotel.

1:17:42.449 --> 1:17:44.910
Ah, it's a ten-minute drive
to the venue.

1:17:47.288 --> 1:17:49.748
Who gets married in a church?

1:17:51.500 --> 1:17:53.294
Who gets married?

1:18:00.551 --> 1:18:03.053
You're gonna come say hi,
though, right?

1:18:05.598 --> 1:18:08.100
- I'll drive you to the hotel.

1:18:08.976 --> 1:18:10.686
What?

1:18:10.686 --> 1:18:13.147
I'll just be in the way.

1:18:13.147 --> 1:18:15.691
Nah.
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

1:18:16.567 --> 1:18:18.485
Not having it.

1:18:20.029 --> 1:18:21.614
You're coming.

1:18:29.914 --> 1:18:31.624
Adam. Hello.

1:18:31.624 --> 1:18:34.209
- Oh, come in, come in, come in.
Everybody's home.

1:18:34.209 --> 1:18:36.962
Oh, my God.
Fantastic.

1:18:36.962 --> 1:18:39.506
Oh, my God, can you believe it?

1:18:39.506 --> 1:18:41.884
Hi, guys. How are you?
Hi. How you doing?

1:18:41.884 --> 1:18:43.469
Come here, you.

1:18:43.469 --> 1:18:45.971
Oh, my God, you have...
you have, like, muscles.

1:18:45.971 --> 1:18:48.933
Like, the SkyBus kind of
makes me want to vomit.

1:18:54.146 --> 1:18:55.522
- I'm Rhiannon.
- Nikola.

1:18:55.522 --> 1:18:56.857
Nikola.

1:18:56.857 --> 1:18:59.193
Bristol?
Wait, where's Bristol again?

1:18:59.193 --> 1:19:01.320
I was born and raised here.
Can't really break out of it.

1:19:01.320 --> 1:19:03.072
Just got to do my meditation...

1:19:03.072 --> 1:19:05.908
No. I don't think I could
ever not live in Australia.

1:19:05.908 --> 1:19:07.368
Yeah?
Yeah, I don't know.

1:19:07.368 --> 1:19:09.328
Your tag's on the bottom
of your shoe.

1:19:09.328 --> 1:19:10.955
Adam, you and I are so having

1:19:10.955 --> 1:19:13.040
- a dance together tonight.
That's okay.

1:19:13.040 --> 1:19:14.583
Not happening. I'm not dancing.

1:19:14.583 --> 1:19:16.168
- You're gonna dance with me.
- I'd ruin the wedding.

1:19:16.168 --> 1:19:18.253
- Come on.
- No, no, no. Kol's the dancer.

1:19:18.253 --> 1:19:19.797
Kol?

1:19:19.797 --> 1:19:21.507
- After a couple drinks, maybe.

1:19:21.507 --> 1:19:23.717
- We're dancing tonight.
Oh, Kolly, it was

1:19:23.717 --> 1:19:26.428
so sweet how you called
after all these years.

1:19:26.428 --> 1:19:28.639
Sorry I was in Bali.

1:19:29.556 --> 1:19:31.308
Oh, that?

1:19:31.308 --> 1:19:32.643
I was so embarrassed.

1:19:32.643 --> 1:19:34.395
I totally mixed up
the time zones.

1:19:34.395 --> 1:19:36.480
I got to say,
I was a bit worried at the time.

1:19:36.480 --> 1:19:38.565
Yeah, Mum was like,
"You've got to

1:19:38.565 --> 1:19:39.692
invite him to the wedding."

1:19:39.692 --> 1:19:41.235
Yeah, of course.

1:19:41.235 --> 1:19:42.653
Sorry, Fay.

1:19:42.653 --> 1:19:43.946
Such a good idea.

1:19:43.946 --> 1:19:46.031
I've just had a flashback.

1:19:46.031 --> 1:19:48.659
Remember picking him up
from dance class?

1:19:48.659 --> 1:19:50.786
We'd turn up at his place,
and he'd be out

1:19:50.786 --> 1:19:52.413
on the nature strip
ten minutes early,

1:19:52.413 --> 1:19:54.373
freezing off
his poor butt cheeks.

1:19:54.373 --> 1:19:56.208
Adorable.

1:19:56.208 --> 1:19:58.293
So, like,
is everyone here gays tonight?

1:19:58.293 --> 1:20:00.504
'Cause, like, a part of me
legit hopes so.

1:20:00.504 --> 1:20:03.048
Really, Rhiannon? Shiraz?

1:20:03.048 --> 1:20:05.801
Maybe put the red wines down.

1:20:05.801 --> 1:20:07.928
I remember you now.

1:20:07.928 --> 1:20:09.346
Kol "Dennick."

1:20:09.346 --> 1:20:11.724
I remember you, too,
Coral Birch.

1:20:11.724 --> 1:20:15.269
Well, it's, uh...
it's Davidovich now.

1:20:15.269 --> 1:20:18.272
- You married a Serb?
- Mm-hmm. Sure did.

1:20:18.272 --> 1:20:20.441
Ziveli. Ziveli?
Is that how you say it?

1:20:20.441 --> 1:20:22.443
Put the red down, Rhiannon.

1:20:22.443 --> 1:20:24.111
- Shockingly close.

1:20:24.111 --> 1:20:26.572
Ziveli. Ziveli!

1:20:26.572 --> 1:20:28.365
Maybe put the reds down for now

1:20:28.365 --> 1:20:30.200
while we're getting dressed
and everything.

1:20:30.200 --> 1:20:33.328
And how about you, Kol?
Are you hoping to get married?

1:20:34.580 --> 1:20:38.333
Well, got to at least wait
till it's legal.

1:20:38.333 --> 1:20:41.170
Oh, Adam didn't wait.
He just got married.

1:20:43.005 --> 1:20:44.423
He did?

1:20:45.215 --> 1:20:48.594
Yeah. Uh, New York, wasn't it?

1:20:50.471 --> 1:20:52.556
- It was Toronto.
Toronto.

1:20:52.556 --> 1:20:55.350
My husband's Canadian,
not American.

1:20:55.350 --> 1:20:56.643
No way. Cool.

1:20:56.643 --> 1:20:57.978
Same diff.
- Yeah.

1:20:57.978 --> 1:20:59.772
Matt couldn't come, then?

1:20:59.772 --> 1:21:01.148
On business.
Oh.

1:21:01.148 --> 1:21:03.567
On a business trip.
- Oh, too bad.

1:21:06.320 --> 1:21:10.574
Is, uh, what's-her-name coming?

1:21:10.574 --> 1:21:12.367
To the wedding? Tari?

1:21:12.367 --> 1:21:14.578
Who would invite her?

1:21:14.578 --> 1:21:16.288
Oh, ziveli!
Careful.

1:21:16.288 --> 1:21:17.998
It's all good. -EBONY: Oh,

1:21:17.998 --> 1:21:19.625
It's a T-shirt,

1:21:19.625 --> 1:21:21.293

1:21:21.293 --> 1:21:22.961
T-shirt? You got fucking

It's upstairs.

1:21:24.880 --> 1:21:26.173

1:21:27.174 --> 1:21:28.675
It's fine.
- Come on.

1:21:28.675 --> 1:21:29.968
- Take it to the dry cleaner.
- Don't worry, it's fine.

1:21:29.968 --> 1:21:31.011

1:21:33.931 --> 1:21:36.016
I'm sorry about her.

1:21:38.227 --> 1:21:39.853

1:21:39.853 --> 1:21:41.855
Yeah.

1:21:42.731 --> 1:21:45.984
Just move anything out of
the way as well. -

1:22:15.889 --> 1:22:18.225
I need a stress-free zone,
or I will freak out.

1:22:18.225 --> 1:22:19.726

1:31:31.611 --> 1:31:33.488
You happy?

1:31:39.536 --> 1:31:41.663

1:32:17.991 --> 1:32:22.787
...life froze to this...

1:32:24.122 --> 1:32:27.208
...this one feeling.

1:32:31.921 --> 1:32:33.965
Sometimes...

1:32:35.175 --> 1:32:37.510
...so many times, I think...

"Fuck.

1:33:51.709 --> 1:33:53.503
"How lucky."

1:33:57.632 --> 1:33:59.843

Where's your key?

1:36:02.006 --> 1:36:04.050
I don't want to fuck.

1:36:07.720 --> 1:36:09.931
Yeah, I know. Me, neither.

1:36:13.601 --> 1:36:15.645
Then what do you want?

1:36:20.733 --> 1:36:22.652
To hold you.

1:37:00.440 --> 1:37:02.734
My beautiful boy.
