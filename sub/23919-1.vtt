Have a seat.

08:01.414 --> 08:03.383

08:23.671 --> 08:26.840
Hey, Al.

08:26.874 --> 08:30.010
What's going on
with you and Darius?

08:31.111 --> 08:33.781
I don't want to talk about it.

08:36.249 --> 08:38.619
All right.

Hey, Earn.

Hey. What's up, Regina?

08:44.925 --> 08:47.160
My name's Tara.

08:47.194 --> 08:48.596
Who's Regina?

08:52.099 --> 08:54.568
Uh, I'm sorry.
Yeah, I always think that.

08:54.602 --> 08:56.103
I know you're Tara. You're Tara.

08:57.137 --> 08:59.072
I just...

08:59.106 --> 09:01.742
You remind me of this girl
named Regina

09:01.775 --> 09:03.010
I went to high school with.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.912
Every time I see you, I'm like,

09:04.945 --> 09:07.347
"Tara's not Regina."
It's crazy, 'cause you...

09:07.380 --> 09:09.416
She was so cool.

09:09.449 --> 09:11.284

09:31.238 --> 09:33.907

09:40.580 --> 09:43.050

So...
-Oh.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.518
'Cause if she's not, uh, can
I stay over for a little bit?

10:18.551 --> 10:20.153
I don't know, man.

10:20.187 --> 10:22.690
You got to talk to Al.

10:24.024 --> 10:26.459
Yeah. What's going on
with you two?

10:26.493 --> 10:28.829
I don't want to talk about it.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.137
How's your parents?

10:37.170 --> 10:39.673
Good. Good.

10:39.707 --> 10:42.810
They're driving
to Florida right now

10:42.843 --> 10:46.446
to visit my uncle who's dying.

10:46.479 --> 10:49.316
Oh, Florida, huh?

10:49.349 --> 10:52.252
Better make sure you tell them
to watch out for Florida Man.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.391
What's Florida Man?

11:02.996 --> 11:05.799
DARIUS:
Florida Man is responsible

11:05.833 --> 11:07.835
for a large percentage
of abnormal incidents

11:07.868 --> 11:09.036
that occur in Florida.

11:09.069 --> 11:10.237
Think of him as a...

11:10.270 --> 11:12.672
alt-right Johnny Appleseed.

11:12.706 --> 11:15.675
No one knows his true identity,

11:15.709 --> 11:18.245
date of birth,
what he looks like.

11:18.278 --> 11:20.447
That's why headlines
always say, "Florida Man."

11:22.515 --> 11:25.418
"Florida Man shoots
unarmed black teenager."

11:27.220 --> 11:28.989
"Florida Man bursts
into ex's delivery room,

11:29.022 --> 11:31.491
and fights new boyfriend
as she's giving birth."

11:31.524 --> 11:34.161
"Florida Man steals a car,
goes to Checkers."

11:34.194 --> 11:35.896
MAN:
Fries!

11:35.929 --> 11:38.899
"Florida Man beats
a flamingo to death."

11:38.932 --> 11:43.170
"Florida Man found
eating another man's face."

11:43.203 --> 11:45.739
-No. No.
-Yes.

11:45.773 --> 11:47.374
-Yes, it's true.
-No.

11:47.407 --> 11:50.510
Him, the state government--
fucking cahoots.

11:50.543 --> 11:53.346
Why would anyone even do that?

11:53.380 --> 11:55.348
To prevent black people
from coming to

11:55.382 --> 11:57.617
and/or registering to vote
in Florida, Earn. Come on.

11:57.650 --> 11:58.919
-Of course.
-Yeah.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.127
You want to turn
the music back on?

12:07.160 --> 12:08.728
-Yeah, sure.
-Yeah.

12:08.762 --> 12:11.899
* Blo, blo, blo, blo,
blo, blo, blo, oh, no. *

12:18.972 --> 12:21.108
Earnest Marks.
First-time offender.

12:21.141 --> 12:23.877
Narcotics possession
with intent to sell?

12:23.911 --> 12:25.779
Um, half a joint.

12:25.813 --> 12:27.447
Plus they said the charge
don't even count,

12:27.480 --> 12:29.282
as long as I don't
get charged again.

12:29.316 --> 12:32.152
Unless you get arrested again,
not charged.

12:32.185 --> 12:34.087
One's easier than the other.

12:34.121 --> 12:37.124
You've already paid
your entrance fee.

12:37.157 --> 12:39.492
Yeah, my jail entrance fee.

12:39.526 --> 12:42.462
We'll need $50 for the mandatory
anti-drug class materials

12:42.495 --> 12:44.764
and each class is $25,
so that's...

12:44.798 --> 12:48.001
$325 plus the $50,

12:48.035 --> 12:51.571
$375 in total. Are you able
to pay this amount at this time?

12:51.604 --> 12:53.340
No.

12:53.373 --> 12:54.574
A payment plan will be set up

12:54.607 --> 12:55.809
for the remainder
of your classes.

12:55.843 --> 12:57.177
Please pay promptly,
or a warrant

12:57.210 --> 13:00.413
will be issued for your arrest.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.449
Would I even have to show up
for these classes

13:02.482 --> 13:04.117
if I paid for the whole thing
in full?

13:04.151 --> 13:06.186
You can't, so let's not.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.190
Take one of those cups
by the door,

13:10.223 --> 13:12.292
fill it up and leave it
in the cupboard.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.527
Yes. Thank you.

13:21.969 --> 13:24.337
What flavor
is a Flamin' Hot Cheeto?

13:24.371 --> 13:26.373
Hot.

13:31.744 --> 13:33.914
I am tasting hot.

13:39.252 --> 13:42.655
Robbin' Season.

13:42.689 --> 13:44.657
Christmas approaches,

13:44.691 --> 13:47.127
and everybody got to eat.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.162
Or be eaten.

13:55.668 --> 13:56.803
Hey, what's up?

13:56.836 --> 13:58.571
Yo, where you at?

13:58.605 --> 14:00.173
I'm with Darius.
We're on our way back.

14:00.207 --> 14:02.910
Hold on, let me put you
on speaker.

14:02.943 --> 14:06.013
ALFRED:
Nigga, take me off speaker.

14:06.046 --> 14:07.514
Yeah.

14:07.547 --> 14:10.250
Yo, I need you to go over
to Willy's.

14:10.283 --> 14:11.818
Why, what's wrong?

14:11.851 --> 14:13.653
That Yvonne done called here
screaming,

14:13.686 --> 14:15.488
saying he done
kidnapped her and shit.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.057
She done called the police.

14:17.090 --> 14:20.727
Look, just go over there and
make sure he good, all right?

14:20.760 --> 14:22.762
Earn, you got it?

14:22.795 --> 14:26.199
-Yeah, I got it.
-All right. Peace.

14:30.037 --> 14:32.839
Can you drop me off somewhere?

14:32.872 --> 14:34.241
Yup.

14:50.557 --> 14:53.060
-I'll be back.
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.

14:53.093 --> 14:55.595
You mind if I come
in here with you, bro?

14:55.628 --> 14:58.198
The vibes here
are just so intense.

14:58.231 --> 15:01.101
YVONNE: Yeah, I got something
for your ass. Yeah, I got...

15:01.134 --> 15:02.802
Sure.

15:17.985 --> 15:19.486
YVONNE:
I'm not playing with you.

15:24.524 --> 15:26.393
WILLY:
Who is it?!

15:26.426 --> 15:28.395
It's Earn.

15:28.428 --> 15:31.398
("I'll Be Good"
by René & Angela playing)

15:31.431 --> 15:34.001
* Passin' in the streets *

15:34.034 --> 15:35.902
* Words unspoken *

15:35.935 --> 15:38.405
* Silence unbroken, hey *

15:38.438 --> 15:41.008
* Just by chance... *

15:41.041 --> 15:42.909
Take your shoes off.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.677
* The cry of success *

15:44.711 --> 15:46.913
-* Left no room to guess *

15:46.946 --> 15:48.648
* Oh, no, oh, no... *

15:48.681 --> 15:49.916
Y'all can't sleep here.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.518
We're not staying here.
Where's Yvonne?

15:54.154 --> 15:56.856
Bitch, you better hope
it ain't the police.

15:56.889 --> 15:59.993
-Did you lock...

16:00.027 --> 16:01.528
* I put you through, baby... *

16:01.561 --> 16:03.763
Did you lock her in there?

16:03.796 --> 16:04.864
This is my house.

16:04.897 --> 16:07.134
I'm supposed to be asking you,

16:07.167 --> 16:09.936
"
-Yeah, Al sent me.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.839
He too good to come see me now
on his own

16:12.872 --> 16:15.008
No, he's on house arrest.
Yvonne called.

16:15.042 --> 16:16.443
Said she was kidnapped.

16:16.476 --> 16:19.346
Did he happen to mention to you

16:19.379 --> 16:23.550
that that thieving,
raggedy bitch stole $50

16:23.583 --> 16:25.352
out of my pocket
while I was sleeping?

16:25.385 --> 16:27.120
YVONNE:
I did not, Willy.

16:27.154 --> 16:29.122
Well, where, pray tell,
is it, then, Yvonne?

16:29.156 --> 16:31.058
We the only two
motherfuckers in here.

16:31.091 --> 16:32.459
-YVONNE: I don't know.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.127
Maybe your stupid ass
drank the $50.

16:34.161 --> 16:36.496
I ain't drank shit. Okay?

16:36.529 --> 16:38.565
I ain't never drank
no $50 in my life.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.333
The fuck she talking about?

16:40.367 --> 16:42.001
She said kidnapping
when she called, okay?

16:42.035 --> 16:44.837
Kidnapping's serious.
You know that, right

16:44.871 --> 16:47.540
WILLY: Well, I must've kidnapped
that bitch in 1974,

16:47.574 --> 16:49.409
'cause she ain't been a kid
in 45 years.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.078
She in there?

16:51.111 --> 16:54.481
No, and don't go in there.
The alligator's in there.

16:54.514 --> 16:57.417
-Hmm. Vibes.

16:57.450 --> 17:00.753
YVONNE: Mmm, there's an
alligator in there, for real.

17:02.955 --> 17:05.492
Give me the keys.

17:05.525 --> 17:08.195
It's gonna take me a while
to be able to find the keys.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.530
They're right there
in front of you.

17:10.563 --> 17:12.999
* I'll be better than before *

17:13.032 --> 17:15.034
* You know I'll love you more *

17:15.068 --> 17:17.070
* I'll be good *

17:17.104 --> 17:19.005
* I fell in love... *

17:19.038 --> 17:22.109
Hey, uh... I-I would say
nice to meet you,

17:22.142 --> 17:24.511
but I don't believe
in time as a concept,

17:24.544 --> 17:27.714
so... I'll just say
we always met.

17:29.082 --> 17:31.884
* Yeah, so good, so bad... *

17:40.227 --> 17:42.862
No. But Patty next door--

17:42.895 --> 17:44.464
she quick to call.

17:48.101 --> 17:49.936
I don't know if you
remember what you said

17:49.969 --> 17:52.139
on the phone,
but kidnapping is a felony,

17:52.172 --> 17:53.806
and if you tell that
to the police,

17:53.840 --> 17:56.075
we're in a lot of trouble.

17:56.109 --> 17:59.812
-Fuck you, Earn.

17:59.846 --> 18:02.415
I didn't take shit.

18:05.918 --> 18:08.755
-Give this to Willy.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.790
But make sure he gives you
your change first.

18:10.823 --> 18:12.792
If you took his $50,

18:12.825 --> 18:15.628
give it back and keep this $100.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.299
Thank Alfred.

18:22.001 --> 18:24.471
Was that alligator here
when I was staying here?

18:24.504 --> 18:27.307
Who Yeah.

18:31.144 --> 18:33.680
Oh, shit. Shit.
I-I didn't call them.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.588
Tired of motherfuckers
knocking on my door

18:44.056 --> 18:45.858
Man, what y'all want?

18:45.892 --> 18:48.161
We were called
about a domestic disturbance.

18:48.195 --> 18:49.762
-No. No.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.631
No, that's the wrong house.
We are not domestic.

18:51.664 --> 18:53.300
-We not even married.
-W-We didn't call, Officer.

18:53.333 --> 18:54.467
We-we good.

18:54.501 --> 18:56.035
Ma'am, do you live here?

18:56.068 --> 18:57.504
No. She don't live here.

18:57.537 --> 18:58.971
I'm fucking the bitch.
That's the deal.

18:59.005 --> 19:00.473
No crime.
-We were called.

19:00.507 --> 19:02.309
Negative. Please step out
into the lawn.

19:02.342 --> 19:04.177
I'm gonna leave
the safety of my house

19:04.211 --> 19:07.113
to step out on the lawn
with y'all for no reason?

19:07.146 --> 19:08.281
I ain't... No. No. No.

19:08.315 --> 19:10.450
I'm not finna do that.
I know how the law work.

19:10.483 --> 19:11.784
If you're trying to arrest me,

19:11.818 --> 19:13.453
you got to get
a complaint from her,

19:13.486 --> 19:15.655
and then it's got to be
filled out and signed.

19:15.688 --> 19:17.490
-That's how the law works.
-No, sir.

19:17.524 --> 19:18.825
That's not how it works.

19:18.858 --> 19:20.493
Comply or we will
put you in cuffs.

19:20.527 --> 19:22.395
Put me in what?

19:22.429 --> 19:24.531
Willy, you-you-you better
go on and talk to them.

19:24.564 --> 19:27.400
WILLY: I'm not talking to these
sons of bitches about nothing,

19:27.434 --> 19:28.868
'cause I ain't do nothing.

19:28.901 --> 19:30.503
And if they keep on
trying to act like

19:30.537 --> 19:31.871
they're gonna come in here
and get me,

19:31.904 --> 19:33.406
then I'll let
that alligator loose and

19:33.440 --> 19:35.675
-see what they do about that.
-You don't have an alligator.

19:35.708 --> 19:38.077
-Yes, he do!
-He do got an alligator.

19:38.110 --> 19:39.379
That's the alligator man.

19:39.412 --> 19:42.382
Them children
ain't lying to you.

19:42.415 --> 19:44.484
I'm the alligator man. Okay?

19:44.517 --> 19:48.054
So, now, just leave me alone,

19:48.087 --> 19:50.690
won't be no gator.
All right?

19:50.723 --> 19:51.991
We'll shoot your
goddamn alligator.

19:52.024 --> 19:54.661
Well, do it. I want to see it!

19:54.694 --> 19:55.728
Do it!

19:55.762 --> 19:57.163
I don't know what
you trying to pull.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.598
All I know is I ain't got

19:58.631 --> 20:02.369
to do shit
'cause I ain't done shit.

20:02.402 --> 20:04.604
Kiss my black ass.

20:06.639 --> 20:08.741
Hey, how's it going?
That's my uncle.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.510
He's a veteran.
Please don't shoot him.

20:10.543 --> 20:13.380
Hey, look, we need him to step
out here or we will tase him.

20:13.413 --> 20:14.781
I know, I get it.
I-I don't want this

20:14.814 --> 20:16.383
to become a big thing, okay?
Just give me five minutes,

20:16.416 --> 20:18.518
I'll talk to him.
He's not dangerous.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.287
He's-he's just unstable,
all right?

20:20.320 --> 20:23.323
Hey... is there an alligator
in there?

20:24.924 --> 20:25.925
Yeah.

20:27.494 --> 20:28.728
Is he friendly with you?

20:30.297 --> 20:33.099
No.

20:33.132 --> 20:34.867
Five-Five minutes.

20:34.901 --> 20:37.570
-Just give me five minutes.
-Shit.

20:42.108 --> 20:45.378
Willy, you got to get out there.
I don't want shit to get crazy.

20:45.412 --> 20:49.048
I don't know, it's already crazy
up in here, bro.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.217
This nigga got a full-grown
caiman in here

20:51.250 --> 20:53.286
-surrounded by
chicken carcasses.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.288
Shit's like an Azealia Banks
Snapchat.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.458
I'm on probation.
I can't go to jail, all right?

20:58.491 --> 21:00.393
If there's gonna be a shootout,
I need to get out of here.

21:00.427 --> 21:02.895
A shootout?

21:02.929 --> 21:04.597
Nigga, I'm not crazy.

21:04.631 --> 21:05.832
I'm not Florida Man.

21:07.334 --> 21:09.235
I just know the law.

21:09.268 --> 21:12.071
As long as I didn't do shit, all
I got to do is stay in my house.

21:12.104 --> 21:14.106
Look, I don't know
if you're high right now,

21:14.140 --> 21:15.575
but you're getting on
my last nerve.

21:15.608 --> 21:16.776
Uh-oh.

21:16.809 --> 21:18.110
Fulton County has no problem

21:18.144 --> 21:19.479
coming in here
and cuffing all of us.

21:19.512 --> 21:20.647
Don't be a...

21:20.680 --> 21:21.914
DARIUS:
Oh, hoo-hoo.

21:21.948 --> 21:23.350
Don't be an idiot.

21:23.383 --> 21:25.818
How you trying to tell me
about myself?

21:25.852 --> 21:27.787
You're homeless, Earn.
You don't even have

21:27.820 --> 21:30.390
a mirror to look at yourself.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.327
Here.

21:34.361 --> 21:37.029
I know you all about
your principles...

21:38.565 --> 21:41.368
...but can we just please,
just listen to Earn

21:41.401 --> 21:43.536
so we can get out of here.
It's four cops

21:43.570 --> 21:45.204
on the other side of that door.

21:45.237 --> 21:46.673
You know if they come in here,

21:46.706 --> 21:48.908
they're gonna get your ass
on a whole lot of other shit.

21:52.579 --> 21:55.348
You lying-ass bitch.

21:55.382 --> 21:56.816
-I knew it.
-You mother...

21:56.849 --> 21:58.217
Mama, I hate you, Willy.

21:58.250 --> 22:00.553
Don't you never come back
to my house no more.

22:00.587 --> 22:02.689
And I hope they blow
your motherfuckin' ass

22:02.722 --> 22:04.624
-to smithereens.
-You better hope they do, bitch.

22:04.657 --> 22:05.725
You better hope they do.

22:05.758 --> 22:08.995
This nigga kidnapped me.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.800
What the hell is wrong with you?

22:13.833 --> 22:16.068
Really, man

22:16.102 --> 22:18.004
What are you wilin' out for?

22:18.037 --> 22:21.040
-You on probation.
Just leave a nigga. -Nah.

22:21.073 --> 22:22.241
The person who owns this house

22:22.274 --> 22:23.743
said I had to make sure
you were okay.

22:26.012 --> 22:28.180
Uh-huh.

22:28.214 --> 22:30.550
You scared.

22:30.583 --> 22:33.319
You got to stay
on his good side now.

22:33.352 --> 22:36.689
'Cause he's Mr. Moneybags.

22:36.723 --> 22:38.525
Remember, Uncle Jarvis
used to manage Damon

22:38.558 --> 22:40.059
when he was in that group.

22:40.092 --> 22:43.329
Now they don't even talk
no more.

22:43.362 --> 22:46.098
'Cause you find out family
is business.

22:46.132 --> 22:47.500
No, that's not it.

22:47.534 --> 22:49.268
-Yeah.

22:49.301 --> 22:51.070
What I'm scared of is being you.

22:51.103 --> 22:54.206
You know, someone everybody knew
was smart, but ended up being

22:54.240 --> 22:57.477
a know-it-all, fuck-up jay that
just let shit happen to him.

23:00.813 --> 23:02.381
Damn.

23:02.415 --> 23:04.617
* So nice... *

23:08.287 --> 23:10.022
Uh, see, the vibe here

23:10.056 --> 23:12.391
is just feeling more and more
like jail.

23:12.425 --> 23:14.794
So I'm gonna...

23:14.827 --> 23:17.396
Yeah, I'll meet you in the car.

23:17.430 --> 23:19.899
-Cool. Cool.
-Cool.

23:19.932 --> 23:22.802
* That I've never felt... *

23:22.835 --> 23:25.438
I didn't do shit.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.408
Willy.

23:29.442 --> 23:31.110
* No, it's not the... *

23:31.143 --> 23:32.244
Willy.

23:32.278 --> 23:34.514
* Feeling I had... *

23:44.356 --> 23:47.560
I meant what I said,
but I'm sorry I said it.

23:47.594 --> 23:49.796
If that makes any sense.

23:53.700 --> 23:56.936
I am scared about Al leaving me.

23:56.969 --> 23:59.806
He don't need me
like that anymore.

23:59.839 --> 24:01.808
He's...

24:01.841 --> 24:04.611
He's kind of a big deal.

24:28.467 --> 24:31.638
I'm still mad at you about
what happened with my mom.

24:31.671 --> 24:35.508
That's why I had what I said
locked and loaded.

24:43.015 --> 24:45.117
You're gonna need this
in the music business.

24:45.151 --> 24:48.220
Take it.

24:48.254 --> 24:50.222
I'm not taking that.

24:50.256 --> 24:52.224
Nigga, I'm not asking you.

24:52.258 --> 24:54.060
There's police all over
this house.

24:55.762 --> 24:58.731
You want to help Al or not?

25:11.110 --> 25:13.980
And if you don't want
to end up like me,

25:14.013 --> 25:17.516
get rid of that
"chip on your shoulder" shit.

25:17.550 --> 25:19.786
It's not worth the time.

25:48.815 --> 25:51.651
