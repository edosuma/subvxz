WEBVTT

00:02.600 --> 00:03.875
<i>My name is Barry Allen,</i>

00:03.960 --> 00:06.077
<i>and I am
the fastest man alive.</i>

00:06.160 --> 00:07.196
<i>To the outside world,</i>

00:07.280 --> 00:09.590
<i>I'm an ordinary
forensic scientist,</i>

00:09.680 --> 00:12.320
<i>but secretly, with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

00:12.400 --> 00:15.154
<i>I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.</i>

00:15.240 --> 00:17.550
<i>But when my daughter came back
from the future to help,</i>

00:17.640 --> 00:19.871
<i>she changed the present,</i>

00:19.960 --> 00:22.475
<i>and now our world is
more dangerous than ever,</i>

00:22.560 --> 00:24.870
<i>and I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.</i>

00:25.000 --> 00:28.277
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

00:28.360 --> 00:31.000
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:31.080 --> 00:33.515
Let's dance, crickets-y.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.034
How can she still come out?

00:35.120 --> 00:37.237
I guess she's immune
to Cicada's dagger?

00:37.320 --> 00:39.357
The shards
weren't dampening my powers.

00:39.440 --> 00:40.874
They were removing them.

00:40.960 --> 00:43.077
We could make
a meta-human cure.

00:43.160 --> 00:45.000
- What this is?
- What is that, Nora's journal?

00:45.040 --> 00:46.440
Have you seen
this code before?

00:46.520 --> 00:48.296
<i>Yeah, right after Barry
came out of the Speed Force.</i>

00:48.320 --> 00:49.776
- It's a time language.
- Time language?

00:49.800 --> 00:51.376
Where does one learn
something like that?

00:51.400 --> 00:54.518
<i>- I created it, actually.</i>
- Clever girl.

01:07.520 --> 01:08.954
My God, Orlin.

01:09.040 --> 01:11.111
You scared
the living daylights out of me.

01:11.200 --> 01:13.078
Did anyone follow you?

01:13.160 --> 01:15.117
Of course not.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.112
It's been weeks since
you fought the Flash

01:17.200 --> 01:19.000
at the hospital.
If anyone knew you were here,

01:19.080 --> 01:20.833
you would have
found out by now.

01:20.920 --> 01:22.877
I got you some groceries

01:22.960 --> 01:25.191
and some Meloxicam
for your injuries.

01:25.280 --> 01:28.034
I don't need it.

01:28.120 --> 01:30.919
Good to hear.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.993
- How's Grace?
- Nothing's changed.

01:34.080 --> 01:37.073
She's stable.
CCPD hasn't left

01:37.200 --> 01:39.157
and they're not leaving
any time soon.

01:39.240 --> 01:41.800
- Well, I need to see her, Doc.
- That's not possible.

01:41.880 --> 01:46.318
Don't tell me
what's possible.

01:46.400 --> 01:49.598
You're angry.
Good.

01:49.680 --> 01:51.056
<i>For all the pain
your family has suffered</i>

01:51.080 --> 01:52.833
<i>at the hands of those metas,
you should be.</i>

01:52.920 --> 01:55.833
But right now there isn't
anything you can do for Grace,

01:55.920 --> 01:59.311
so put that anger
towards something else.

02:00.160 --> 02:01.456
I have a friend
who feels the same way

02:01.480 --> 02:02.834
about meta-humans
as we do,

02:03.280 --> 02:06.159
<i>and he wants to help you finish
what you've started.</i>

02:08.360 --> 02:10.477
<i>Orlin?</i>

02:11.200 --> 02:13.237
It's time to get back to work.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.876
This is it.
The only thing between us

02:24.960 --> 02:28.317
and our big score is one
reinforced concrete wall.

02:28.400 --> 02:31.313
- Don't hurt yourself, Bork.
- Can't hurt Bork.

02:31.400 --> 02:32.720
But Bork can hurt you.

02:32.800 --> 02:35.474
Hyah!

02:37.520 --> 02:38.795
That should do it.

02:40.320 --> 02:42.232
The hell?

02:43.920 --> 02:45.673
Hyah!

02:55.480 --> 02:57.711
Ah!

03:07.680 --> 03:09.797
You're one, too.

03:14.320 --> 03:16.960
Ah!

03:19.480 --> 03:21.551
Ah!

03:31.760 --> 03:34.116
I don't know what's crazier,
how big this guy is

03:34.200 --> 03:36.032
or the number
of incised wounds on his body.

03:36.120 --> 03:37.976
Well, and the depressed skull
fracture points to impact

03:38.000 --> 03:40.834
with hardened surface,
but cause of death

03:40.920 --> 03:42.639
is definitely
repeated stabbings.

03:42.720 --> 03:45.394
Yeah, looks like
someone was really angry.

03:45.480 --> 03:47.278
Look at these wounds.

03:47.360 --> 03:49.576
Doesn't it look like they have
the same depth and diameter

03:49.600 --> 03:50.840
as the ones on Gridlock's body?

03:50.920 --> 03:52.991
Yeah, and like Block's
and Raelene Sharp's.

03:53.080 --> 03:55.675
Yeah.

03:56.320 --> 03:57.720
<i>Iris just got a tip.</i>

03:57.840 --> 04:00.639
Another meta-human was murdered
in her apartment, same C.O.D.

04:00.760 --> 04:04.151
- Dad, these aren't one-offs.
- No.

04:04.240 --> 04:05.959
Cicada's back
and he's on a killing spree.

04:06.040 --> 04:08.056
Okay, well, there's got to be
a lead in one of these attacks

04:08.080 --> 04:10.160
that can help us track him.
We'll get the team on it.

04:13.760 --> 04:15.479
<i>Killer Frost, seriously?</i>

04:15.560 --> 04:16.914
I can't take it anymore.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.834
Uh, Caitlin,
is everything... oh.

04:19.920 --> 04:22.036
Alter-ego confab.

04:22.120 --> 04:24.077
Seen enough episodes
of <i>Sister, Sister</i>

04:24.200 --> 04:25.880
to recognize a sibling spat
when I see one.

04:25.920 --> 04:28.276
Oh. So,
I'm trying to help Cisco

04:28.360 --> 04:29.953
with his meta-human cure,

04:30.080 --> 04:31.520
but every time
I start working on it,

04:31.560 --> 04:34.678
Killer Frost takes over
and messes with my equations.

04:34.760 --> 04:36.160
Like this.

04:36.240 --> 04:38.630
She changed all my
heterozygotes into asterisks.

04:38.720 --> 04:41.633
Oh, I thought those
were just tiny snowflakes.

04:43.480 --> 04:44.596
So she's not on board?

04:44.720 --> 04:47.519
No, and I don't
exactly know why.

04:47.640 --> 04:50.200
- Can't you just ask her?
- Oh, I've tried.

04:50.280 --> 04:51.880
But every time we
start talking about it,

04:51.960 --> 04:54.395
she starts singing
Barney's "I Love You" song.

04:54.520 --> 04:56.557
- Ooh, that's cold.
- Yeah.

04:56.640 --> 04:58.200
What about Cisco?
Is he having any luck?

04:58.240 --> 04:59.240
Not yet.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.760
He went to
the Tannhauser off-site

05:00.840 --> 05:03.275
so he could concentrate.
He says it's quiet there.

05:03.360 --> 05:05.670
Yeah.
Quiet like a tomb.

05:06.280 --> 05:09.432
So I think if I can isolate
the genetic marker

05:09.520 --> 05:11.273
that bonds human DNA
to dark matter,

05:11.360 --> 05:13.079
I can reverse engineer
the process

05:13.160 --> 05:15.117
and unravel it
to create a cure.

05:15.200 --> 05:18.318
- That's great.
- Yeah, except I need meta-DNA

05:18.400 --> 05:20.631
that hasn't fully bonded
with dark matter yet.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.791
Of course,
because as we all know

05:22.880 --> 05:26.032
with genetic modification we...
Why?

05:26.120 --> 05:28.032
Because that's the only time
when I can identify

05:28.120 --> 05:29.176
where the marker
is in the genome.

05:29.200 --> 05:30.680
Okay, so you need DNA

05:30.760 --> 05:32.558
from a meta-human
who was created recently?

05:32.640 --> 05:35.109
Yeah, ideally
in the last eight months,

05:35.200 --> 05:38.318
but everyone I can think of
has been killed by Cicada.

05:38.440 --> 05:40.272
Right.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.312
So where the heck do we look?

05:44.440 --> 05:46.352
<i>The lone decrypted entry</i>

05:46.440 --> 05:49.433
from the journal
of Nora West Allen:

05:49.520 --> 05:52.638
"The timeline is malleable."

05:52.720 --> 05:55.280
Why that's the only one
that translated?

05:56.080 --> 05:58.595
And why is she interested
in the timeline,

05:58.680 --> 06:00.512
and maybe more important,

06:00.600 --> 06:02.751
why is she hiding
this interest?

06:04.040 --> 06:06.157
<i>Sherloque,
we need you in the cortex.</i>

06:06.240 --> 06:07.993
But of course.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.390
Kira May,
Dwayne Geist, Carl Bork.

06:15.520 --> 06:17.955
All three metas who were killed
by Cicada last night.

06:18.040 --> 06:19.713
So Cicada's killed
almost as many people

06:19.800 --> 06:22.440
in the last 12 hours as he has
in the last eight months?

06:22.520 --> 06:24.456
And it doesn't look like
he's slowing down anytime soon.

06:24.480 --> 06:26.600
Well, we need to stop him
before he hurts anyone else.

06:26.640 --> 06:28.616
Sherloque, do you have any
ideas on what to do about that?

06:28.640 --> 06:30.996
Not at the moment, but any
time I run into a road block

06:31.080 --> 06:32.878
in an investigation,
I do what I always do.

06:32.960 --> 06:36.317
I just pursue
a different avenue.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.240
We'll find him.
Something will bring him to us.

06:38.280 --> 06:39.953
Something like...

06:40.040 --> 06:41.536
Satellites picking up
dark matter flare.

06:41.560 --> 06:43.552
- It's him.
- Something like that.

06:43.640 --> 06:44.696
Suit up.
We don't have a lot of time.

06:44.720 --> 06:48.316
Not without precautions.
For Killer Frost.

06:48.400 --> 06:51.598
She doesn't need a weapon.
Killer Frost is the weapon.

06:56.160 --> 06:59.198
Powers or no powers,
I will mess you up.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.437
Ah!

07:19.520 --> 07:20.874
Negate this!

07:29.480 --> 07:30.834
Hold on.
Help!

07:30.920 --> 07:32.673
We need Caitlin.

07:36.160 --> 07:37.440
We need to get her
to a hospital.

07:37.560 --> 07:39.153
Here, come with me.

07:41.720 --> 07:43.279
Oh, God.

07:46.960 --> 07:49.191
Ah!

07:54.560 --> 07:56.517
Aah!

07:57.880 --> 07:59.075
No!

07:59.160 --> 08:00.913
Aah!

08:06.440 --> 08:08.432
Nora.
Hey, Nora, Nora?

08:08.520 --> 08:11.558
Okay, Nora...
Nora?

08:12.280 --> 08:13.953
Nora?

08:30.640 --> 08:31.960
Well?

08:34.600 --> 08:37.558
Cicada caused
an axial burst fracture

08:37.640 --> 08:40.917
in her L3, L4, and L5
vertebrae.

08:41.039 --> 08:43.429
He also severely displaced

08:43.520 --> 08:45.637
her fourth thoracic vertebrae.

08:47.240 --> 08:48.959
It's not good.

08:49.480 --> 08:51.437
But her speed healing
is going to kick in, right?

08:54.520 --> 08:56.591
Right?

08:56.720 --> 09:00.191
Cicada's cut flooded
her body with dark matter.

09:00.280 --> 09:03.318
It's affecting her powers.

09:03.400 --> 09:05.471
Her speed healing
should kick in...

09:05.560 --> 09:07.153
but for now...

09:09.880 --> 09:12.270
I'll keep monitoring
her progress.

09:17.720 --> 09:21.919
- Barry.
- It's okay, she'll heal.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.435
It'll be all right.

09:27.760 --> 09:29.160
Nora?

09:29.240 --> 09:32.631
Oh, what happened?

09:32.720 --> 09:34.552
Honey, um...

09:34.640 --> 09:37.200
Oh, why does it hurt
to breathe?

09:37.280 --> 09:39.670
It's gonna hurt
for a little bit.

09:39.760 --> 09:41.991
Why?

09:43.360 --> 09:45.875
I can't move my legs.

09:45.960 --> 09:49.590
Um, why can't I move my legs?

09:49.680 --> 09:51.831
- Mom, I can't move my legs.
- Nora.

09:51.920 --> 09:53.912
Mom?
Mom, why can't I move my legs?

09:54.000 --> 09:56.151
Nora, look.

09:57.240 --> 09:59.596
You can't move
your legs because...

10:00.840 --> 10:02.957
Cicada broke your back.

10:03.600 --> 10:05.637
What?
So I'm paralyzed?

10:05.720 --> 10:07.996
- What, forever?
- No, no, not forever.

10:08.080 --> 10:10.470
Well, for how long then?

10:13.120 --> 10:14.793
We don't know.

10:17.440 --> 10:18.999
Mom...

10:21.320 --> 10:23.039
Hey, I got here
as fast as I could.

10:23.120 --> 10:24.190
Joe's still in Tibet.

10:24.280 --> 10:25.919
I left him a message
to get back ASAP.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.037
Hey, it's all right.
He should stay with Wally.

10:28.120 --> 10:29.190
- Oh, my God.
- Hey.

10:29.280 --> 10:30.953
Hi.

10:32.880 --> 10:35.679
- How is she?
- It's not good.

10:37.280 --> 10:39.636
I'm so sorry, Barry.

10:39.720 --> 10:41.632
Hey, I don't care
how we do it.

10:41.720 --> 10:43.996
- We need to stop Dwyer now.
- Well, I agree.

10:44.120 --> 10:45.336
All right, well,
I'm gonna call Cisco.

10:45.360 --> 10:47.320
- We should get him back here.
- No, no, no, he...

10:47.400 --> 10:49.357
he should finish the cure
he's working on.

10:49.440 --> 10:50.656
His time is better spent there.

10:50.680 --> 10:52.114
- Sherloque.
<i>- Oui?</i>

10:52.200 --> 10:54.590
Earn your money.
How do we track this guy?

10:54.680 --> 10:56.216
Well, I think the first thing
we should do

10:56.240 --> 10:58.357
is concentrate on the victims.
Look for a connection.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.955
Take a look here for example.
This man, Geist,

11:01.040 --> 11:02.793
has a spider tattoo
on his neck,

11:02.880 --> 11:05.270
generally indicating he was
caught in some form of web.

11:05.360 --> 11:09.115
What kind of web?
A prison web, perhaps.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.556
- And Kira May...
- She was wearing clothes.

11:11.640 --> 11:12.976
Of course she was
wearing clothes, Giraffe.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.216
No, she was wearing clothes
that are two sizes too large.

11:15.240 --> 11:17.391
- Two sizes too large.
- Recent rapid weight loss.

11:17.480 --> 11:19.296
It's a common side effect
of solitary confinement.

11:19.320 --> 11:20.800
- Right.
- And Carl Borg...

11:20.880 --> 11:22.336
<i>And Carl Borg,
this report says</i>

11:22.360 --> 11:23.360
<i>he had a droopy eyelid,</i>

11:23.440 --> 11:24.874
<i>which is nerve paralysis,</i>

11:24.960 --> 11:27.634
common side effect
of consuming too much borat.

11:27.720 --> 11:30.280
Or as it's known
on this earth, bruno.

11:30.360 --> 11:31.696
More commonly known
as prison wine.

11:31.720 --> 11:32.756
Prison wine.

11:32.840 --> 11:34.016
All three of these meta-humans

11:34.040 --> 11:36.316
were former criminals.

11:36.400 --> 11:37.720
Look at this.

11:37.840 --> 11:39.752
It's a meta-human
arrest log from 2018.

11:39.840 --> 11:41.160
Look at the first three names.

11:41.240 --> 11:42.674
<i>These were his victims.</i>

11:42.760 --> 11:44.280
He's killing
in the order of this list.

11:44.320 --> 11:46.376
<i>This list has addresses,
employment information.</i>

11:46.400 --> 11:48.596
It's got license plate numbers.
This is everything

11:48.680 --> 11:50.194
Cicada needs to find them.

11:50.280 --> 11:52.078
Where would he even get this?

11:52.160 --> 11:53.719
I think there's only
one place, right?

11:56.880 --> 12:00.351
<i>There's a killer
still at large in our city.</i>

12:00.440 --> 12:03.512
People are afraid of being
out in the streets.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.876
I'm getting 100 phone calls
a day about this guy.

12:05.960 --> 12:07.599
I want neighborhoods
re-canvassed.

12:07.680 --> 12:10.320
I want evidence re-examined.
Jonesy!

12:10.400 --> 12:12.995
Take your unit and paper
the city with Dwyer's photo.

12:13.080 --> 12:16.437
I want this guy.
Let's go get him!

12:20.320 --> 12:21.674
Allen?

12:21.800 --> 12:23.951
We need to talk...
in private.

12:24.040 --> 12:25.360
All right.

12:27.960 --> 12:28.960
What the hell is this?

12:29.040 --> 12:32.158
That's how Dwyer's
getting his victims.

12:32.240 --> 12:35.074
This is from our database
of meta-humans?

12:36.080 --> 12:37.958
Well, it doesn't prove
he got it from CCPD.

12:38.520 --> 12:39.715
Doesn't it?

12:39.800 --> 12:41.096
<i>He could have broken
into another precinct</i>

12:41.120 --> 12:43.430
or hacked into
the CCPD database.

12:43.520 --> 12:45.398
David Dwyer is a machinist.
He's not a hacker.

12:45.480 --> 12:47.312
Somebody gave this to him.
Somebody here!

12:47.400 --> 12:48.776
Okay, Barry,
maybe we should go ahead

12:48.800 --> 12:52.191
and let Captain Singh
look into this on his own.

12:52.640 --> 12:54.393
Yeah,
I think that's a good idea.

12:59.680 --> 13:01.080
Thank you, David.

13:01.160 --> 13:03.117
<i>Hey, Barry. Barry.</i>

13:05.000 --> 13:07.310
Barry, where are you going?

13:07.400 --> 13:08.754
I don't know, Cecile,

13:08.840 --> 13:10.274
but I gotta do something

13:10.360 --> 13:12.016
before Dwyer kills
all the people on that list.

13:12.040 --> 13:13.633
Hey.

13:14.840 --> 13:16.035
What if we use it, too?

13:16.840 --> 13:18.433
- What?
- The list.

13:18.520 --> 13:20.336
Three years ago, Joe asked me
to help get meta-humans

13:20.360 --> 13:21.714
transferred out of the city.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.678
Yeah, I remember.
You told him not to do it.

13:23.760 --> 13:26.958
Yeah, well, that was before
I knew what I know now.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.032
Besides, those metas
were active prisoners.

13:29.160 --> 13:31.391
These metas, they've already
served their time.

13:31.480 --> 13:33.336
Look, even if we got 'em out
of town, it wouldn't matter.

13:33.360 --> 13:34.976
Cicada's gonna
track them down eventually.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.753
They need new names,
new identities.

13:36.840 --> 13:38.176
We don't have the resources
to do that.

13:38.200 --> 13:40.078
No, we do not.

13:40.160 --> 13:41.833
But the Feds do.

13:41.920 --> 13:43.056
They give
this kind of protection

13:43.080 --> 13:44.514
to regular humans all the time.

13:44.600 --> 13:46.016
It is about time
they start offering it

13:46.040 --> 13:47.679
to meta-humans, too.

13:47.760 --> 13:50.355
I am going to go call in every
favor I have ever banked

13:50.440 --> 13:52.113
and I am going to make
this thing happen,

13:52.200 --> 13:56.160
and in the meantime, you need
to go get them somewhere safe.

13:56.240 --> 13:58.232
- All right.
- Okay.

14:05.200 --> 14:07.840
So, can you try
wiggling your toes?

14:11.240 --> 14:12.640
I can't.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.349
Again?

14:14.840 --> 14:16.194
I can't.

14:19.640 --> 14:22.712
- Anything?
- I don't feel anything.

14:22.840 --> 14:25.912
Okay, well, Cicada's dark
matter has left your system,

14:26.000 --> 14:28.071
so you should be
healing soon.

14:28.160 --> 14:30.152
I mean, since my last scan,
your spinal axons

14:30.240 --> 14:31.469
have grown five millimeters.

14:31.560 --> 14:33.233
That's something, right?

14:33.320 --> 14:34.879
It's progress.

14:34.960 --> 14:36.720
Maybe not quite the speed
we were hoping for,

14:36.800 --> 14:38.632
but it's something.

14:40.760 --> 14:42.877
I'm going to go run
a few more tests.

14:48.920 --> 14:51.071
Hey.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.669
Don't give up, okay?

14:53.760 --> 14:55.638
Growth is growth.

14:58.280 --> 15:01.637
Normal axon growth rate
reaches five millimeters

15:01.720 --> 15:04.872
a day in a large nerve.

15:04.960 --> 15:08.032
With speed healing,
mine should be over 100.

15:08.120 --> 15:10.316
How do you know that?

15:10.400 --> 15:12.153
I took neuro-regeneration

15:12.240 --> 15:14.835
in my fifth grade STEM class.

15:16.440 --> 15:19.274
I took fractions
in fifth grade.

15:23.440 --> 15:27.354
What if I don't heal, Mom?
What if I never get better?

15:32.040 --> 15:35.351
Can I just be left alone
for a little bit, please?

15:37.640 --> 15:39.996
Yeah.
Okay.

15:56.040 --> 15:58.714
I respect your right
to protest the cure, Frosty,

15:58.800 --> 16:02.077
but even for me,
that is excessive.

16:02.160 --> 16:04.720
Well, maybe Caitlin
will get the hint now.

16:04.800 --> 16:06.393
Uh...

16:06.480 --> 16:09.917
Snow and Frost are having
creative differences.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.275
I'll get Caitlin.

16:11.360 --> 16:15.354
No, I-I need you, actually.

16:15.440 --> 16:17.240
We need to get all those metas
to a safe house

16:17.320 --> 16:18.640
before Cicada finds them.

16:18.720 --> 16:21.679
Oh, and you think
they're going to listen to me?

16:21.760 --> 16:23.080
50-50 on that.

16:23.160 --> 16:25.800
I haven't quite lived up
to my name.

16:25.920 --> 16:29.231
But I do know where
we should start.

16:34.320 --> 16:36.960
Doesn't look like
anyone's been here in months.

16:37.040 --> 16:39.191
Maybe the rumors about
Amunet skipping town are true.

16:39.280 --> 16:42.318
We're not here for Amunet.
We're here for her pet snake.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.198
And the thing about snakes is,

16:44.280 --> 16:47.193
they're always lurking
in some dark corner.

16:52.640 --> 16:53.960
Hello, Norvock.

16:54.040 --> 16:57.078
Frost, thank God it's you.

17:06.160 --> 17:08.720
Those are Cicada's targets,
but we need your help

17:08.800 --> 17:10.576
rounding everyone up
so we can get them to safety.

17:10.599 --> 17:12.576
Because they're not going
to trust a bunch of masks?

17:12.599 --> 17:15.512
They will if you tell them
it's for their own good.

17:15.599 --> 17:17.512
Some of these guys
are bad news.

17:17.599 --> 17:19.830
- You sure they're worth saving?
- Are you?

17:19.920 --> 17:21.798
<i>Cicada's not going to stop
until every meta</i>

17:21.880 --> 17:24.031
in this city is dead.
Is that how you want to end up?

17:24.640 --> 17:27.439
Damn.
What did he do to you?

17:28.000 --> 17:29.416
<i>We've arranged
for everyone to enter</i>

17:29.440 --> 17:30.760
a witness protection
program.

17:30.840 --> 17:31.936
Federal agents will lead you

17:31.960 --> 17:33.838
out of the city
to safety tonight.

17:34.520 --> 17:36.000
All right.

17:37.760 --> 17:41.470
I'm in, but only if I'm the
first one on that transport.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.517
Nice of you to look out
for your fellow metas.

17:43.600 --> 17:45.432
I look out for me
and me alone.

17:45.520 --> 17:46.954
Then let's get
to rounding up.

17:47.040 --> 17:48.633
Yup.

17:52.280 --> 17:54.431
<i>- David.</i>
- If this is about that list...

17:54.520 --> 17:56.751
It is,
but it's not what you think.

17:56.840 --> 17:59.355
I need your help.

17:59.440 --> 18:01.033
With what?

18:01.120 --> 18:03.396
I'm having those metas
moved to federal protection,

18:03.480 --> 18:06.075
- which is where you come in.
- What do you need?

18:06.160 --> 18:10.279
Road blocks, tonight,
from Linsin to Webber Avenue.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.995
I know, David, I know,
but I can't risk

18:13.080 --> 18:16.073
any incoming traffic
during the scheduled transfer.

18:16.160 --> 18:17.310
I'll make it happen.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.357
Thank you.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.751
Officer Jones.

18:25.840 --> 18:28.674
- You all right?
- Never better.

18:42.640 --> 18:44.438
I'm tired of waiting.

18:45.160 --> 18:47.516
<i>This Cicada,
he wants to kill us?</i>

18:48.600 --> 18:50.034
I say we kill him first.

18:52.440 --> 18:54.909
You can't.
We're your only chance.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.151
- So you keep saying.
- Look, if you're too dumb

18:57.280 --> 18:58.316
to recognize the truth,

18:58.400 --> 19:00.119
then you can go,
but you're on your own.

19:00.240 --> 19:03.039
I'm not going to watch anybody
else be broken by this maniac.

19:05.400 --> 19:07.039
He's telling the truth.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.232
I saw Cicada kill Carl Bork.

19:12.320 --> 19:13.515
Bork's dead?

19:14.120 --> 19:17.079
His dagger
took away our powers.

19:17.160 --> 19:20.597
I ran, Bork fought.

19:20.720 --> 19:23.110
That's why I'm here
and he's not.

19:23.200 --> 19:26.352
So, yeah, leave if you want,

19:26.440 --> 19:28.716
but I'm gonna listen
to these guys

19:29.600 --> 19:31.353
and stay alive.

19:42.800 --> 19:45.235
That was quite
the speech back there.

19:45.320 --> 19:46.959
Almost seemed like
you actually wanted

19:47.080 --> 19:48.400
to save those meta-humans.

19:48.480 --> 19:51.234
No, you know me
better than that.

19:51.320 --> 19:53.755
No, I don't think I do.

19:54.600 --> 19:58.150
I used to be a good guy,
you know?

19:58.240 --> 20:02.632
I worked at the Central City
Zoo, watching the reptile cage.

20:02.760 --> 20:06.390
We were open the night the
particle accelerator blew up.

20:07.160 --> 20:09.880
After the blast
shattered all the cages,

20:09.960 --> 20:13.840
I had to pull
an elapid snake off a kid.

20:13.920 --> 20:16.515
Then that dark matter hit.

20:16.600 --> 20:17.920
What happened to the kid?

20:18.000 --> 20:21.072
He's fine.

20:21.160 --> 20:24.392
But what do I get, huh?
A snake in my head?

20:24.480 --> 20:27.234
And a psycho killer
that wants me dead?

20:27.320 --> 20:31.712
That was the last time I put
anyone else before myself.

20:41.640 --> 20:45.190
You know, it's almost like
a small part of me feels

20:45.280 --> 20:46.634
sorry for that guy.

20:46.720 --> 20:49.189
Why?
He's only out for himself.

20:49.280 --> 20:52.512
Come on,
he's clearly terrified.

20:52.600 --> 20:54.193
I know what that's like.

20:54.280 --> 20:55.680
You're going to tell me

20:55.760 --> 20:58.514
that you've
never felt fear like that?

20:59.640 --> 21:02.553
- No, why?
- Really?

21:02.640 --> 21:06.554
Not even a little bit worried
about Caitlin making the cure?

21:15.040 --> 21:18.716
- Is that everyone?
- Everyone except Shawna Baez.

21:19.240 --> 21:21.311
A meta that calls herself
Peek-A-Boo?

21:21.400 --> 21:22.800
Anyone know where she'll be?

21:22.880 --> 21:24.951
Try the Sundollar on Eighth.

21:26.400 --> 21:27.914
All right.

21:33.880 --> 21:36.952
Bar's not open yet.
Not even for you, Flash.

21:37.040 --> 21:38.394
Shawna.

21:38.480 --> 21:39.834
I need you to come with me.

21:41.640 --> 21:42.776
I didn't do anything
this time.

21:42.800 --> 21:44.519
I know.
You're not in trouble.

21:44.600 --> 21:45.656
All right,
you're in danger.

21:45.680 --> 21:46.816
I want to take you
some place safe.

21:46.840 --> 21:50.151
Like your science prison?
Sorry.

21:52.680 --> 21:54.399
Shawna?
Please.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.312
Somebody is trying to kill you.

21:56.400 --> 21:59.040
Someone's always trying
to kill me.

21:59.120 --> 22:00.793
See ya around, Flash.

22:05.440 --> 22:07.591
What did you do to me?

22:07.720 --> 22:09.757
Shawna, run.

22:13.120 --> 22:14.190
Who the hell is that?

22:14.280 --> 22:15.760
Take this,
press the button.

22:15.840 --> 22:17.593
When a breach opens,
jump into it.

22:19.640 --> 22:21.074
Go!

22:23.880 --> 22:25.360
Hyah!

22:28.040 --> 22:29.554
Come on, come on...

22:48.480 --> 22:50.119
Make this thing work.

23:11.200 --> 23:14.830
They're all terrified.
I can feel it.

23:14.920 --> 23:17.071
Maybe now they believe us.

23:17.160 --> 23:19.072
Hey, we're almost
through this.

23:19.160 --> 23:21.311
We are going to get all
of these people to safety.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.517
Even if we do, Cicada's
not going to stop killing.

23:23.600 --> 23:26.991
- Not until...
- Until he's dead.

23:28.360 --> 23:31.353
- I didn't say that.
- You didn't have to.

23:31.440 --> 23:33.671
The anger that I feel
from you says it all.

23:33.760 --> 23:35.680
How am I supposed to feel?
He almost killed Nora.

23:35.760 --> 23:37.911
Barry, I understand, I do.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.357
That man hurt your child.

23:41.480 --> 23:43.472
But this anger
that you're feeling,

23:43.560 --> 23:45.074
I have felt it before...

23:45.160 --> 23:47.231
from Cicada.

23:47.960 --> 23:50.919
<i>Honey, if you let it,
this rage will consume you,</i>

23:51.000 --> 23:53.356
<i>the same way
it's already consumed him.</i>

23:55.720 --> 23:58.440
Wait, I have felt this anger
from someone before.

23:59.400 --> 24:01.232
At CCPD.
Oh, my God, Barry,

24:01.320 --> 24:02.680
I think I know
who leaked the list.

24:02.720 --> 24:03.790
Then let's go get him.

24:03.920 --> 24:05.639
No, no, no, you...
you stay here.

24:05.720 --> 24:07.552
You get these metas
to the drop.

24:07.640 --> 24:08.640
I can handle the rest.

24:24.600 --> 24:27.718
Ah, well, look.
Neurological delight.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.359
Why, you'll be back
on these feet

24:29.440 --> 24:31.272
and chasing Cicada
in no time.

24:31.360 --> 24:33.079
- I hope so.
- Yes. In the meantime,

24:33.200 --> 24:34.554
maybe you can help me
do the same.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.438
Oh, I already told
the team everything I know

24:36.520 --> 24:38.876
- about the Flash museum.
- Flash museum, right.

24:38.960 --> 24:41.191
Do you think that
I could look at the archives

24:41.280 --> 24:42.350
from that Flash museum?

24:42.440 --> 24:44.193
After all, I have made a career

24:44.280 --> 24:48.069
out of noticing things
that other people miss.

24:48.160 --> 24:50.994
Maybe it's not a problem
to bring those archives

24:51.080 --> 24:52.992
for me to look at?

24:53.080 --> 24:54.719
Yeah, I guess so.

24:54.800 --> 24:57.952
Or maybe it's easier
for me to go there?

24:58.040 --> 25:00.191
You want me to bring you
to the future?

25:00.280 --> 25:02.920
Mm.
It's a great suggestion.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.754
<i>Is it even possible
for a non-speedster</i>

25:05.840 --> 25:08.480
to go into the commodity...
What'd you call it? The, um...

25:08.560 --> 25:11.758
- The Speed Force?
- Speed Force. Right.

25:11.840 --> 25:13.672
Uh, I'm not sure.

25:13.760 --> 25:15.752
Mm.
Right.

25:15.840 --> 25:17.877
Well, perhaps that's a question

25:17.960 --> 25:19.679
<i>for someone
with more experience.</i>

25:19.760 --> 25:22.116
- Sherloque.
- Mm?

25:22.200 --> 25:24.715
Can I talk to you
for a second?

25:25.280 --> 25:26.555
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

25:34.160 --> 25:36.311
- That's my daughter in there.
- Yes, so?

25:36.400 --> 25:38.296
And I'm going to do whatever
it takes to protect her.

25:38.320 --> 25:41.279
Even from people
who I thought were her friends.

25:41.360 --> 25:43.192
So I'm gonna need you
to tell me right now

25:43.280 --> 25:44.794
why you're
investigating Nora.

25:44.880 --> 25:46.314
Invest... no, no.
<i>Quoi?</i>

25:46.400 --> 25:48.517
No one's investigating Nora.

25:50.720 --> 25:53.952
Quoi?
<i>No one's investigating Nora.</i>

25:56.880 --> 25:59.793
Maybe I'm investigating
Nora a little bit.

26:00.680 --> 26:02.239
Why?

26:02.320 --> 26:04.198
You think, what,
Nora is hiding something?

26:04.280 --> 26:06.397
No, um...

26:06.480 --> 26:08.312
How can I say this?

26:08.400 --> 26:10.278
Sometimes
when you're a detective,

26:10.360 --> 26:12.670
you see a story
and you follow it.

26:12.760 --> 26:15.150
And there's different tracks.

26:15.240 --> 26:16.720
You follow down the track.

26:16.800 --> 26:18.951
With Nora,
I am following down this track.

26:19.400 --> 26:20.960
Do you know how many stories
I've chased

26:21.040 --> 26:22.872
- that went absolutely nowhere?
- Mm.

26:22.960 --> 26:25.429
So many that I stopped
chasing them for a while

26:25.560 --> 26:27.233
instead of doing
what I should have done,

26:27.320 --> 26:29.437
something you suggested,
actually,

26:29.520 --> 26:31.239
which is going down
a different track.

26:31.320 --> 26:33.118
Mm.

26:33.200 --> 26:36.716
That track is the wrong one.

26:40.240 --> 26:42.471
Careful
with your little monocle.

26:42.560 --> 26:45.314
Learn to take notes
like everyone else.

26:46.040 --> 26:47.394
Nora!

26:49.760 --> 26:53.390
Oh, my goodness.

26:58.560 --> 27:00.358
What do you want, Ralph?

27:02.680 --> 27:03.856
I know it's none
of my business

27:03.880 --> 27:05.000
<i>why you're afraid of a cure,</i>

27:05.080 --> 27:09.313
but for what it's worth,
I'm a meta,

27:10.240 --> 27:11.993
and I'm all for it.

27:12.560 --> 27:15.120
And after talking with most
of those people out there...

27:16.640 --> 27:18.711
- So are some of them.
- Oh, yeah, I can see that.

27:18.800 --> 27:20.757
I just don't understand why.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.559
It might save their lives.

27:22.640 --> 27:23.915
It's not that simple for me.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
Why not?

27:26.120 --> 27:28.635
Because, just like Norvock
didn't ask for his snake,

27:28.720 --> 27:30.120
Caity didn't ask for me.

27:30.200 --> 27:33.238
So if one day she wakes up
scared of being a meta-human

27:33.320 --> 27:35.551
and decides to take that cure,

27:35.640 --> 27:37.916
her powers don't
just disappear.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.992
I do too.

27:40.080 --> 27:41.878
<i>That's what
I'm really afraid of.</i>

27:42.720 --> 27:45.189
'Cause if I'm gone
who's going to protect her?

27:47.320 --> 27:49.755
It's witching hour.

27:53.720 --> 27:56.872
I get why
you're scared, but...

27:59.160 --> 28:01.994
you need to know that when
DeVoe made you disappear,

28:02.080 --> 28:04.879
all Caitlin talked about
was getting you back.

28:04.960 --> 28:07.395
<i>So maybe as much as you want
to protect her,</i>

28:08.120 --> 28:10.680
Caitlin wants
to protect you, too.

28:17.960 --> 28:22.477
I went after three of them
tonight and they weren't there.

28:22.560 --> 28:25.029
Did you tip them off?

28:26.840 --> 28:29.116
No, I swear.

28:29.200 --> 28:30.998
After what that Spencer woman
did to me

28:31.080 --> 28:34.039
with her meta-tech,
I want them all gone.

28:34.800 --> 28:37.713
- Then what happened?
- The D.A.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.400
She figured out
you're targeting everyone

28:39.440 --> 28:40.794
on the list I gave you.

28:40.880 --> 28:42.439
The contact of mine
with the Feds

28:42.520 --> 28:43.616
says they're being picked up

28:43.640 --> 28:44.915
and put into
protective custody.

28:45.400 --> 28:46.800
Tonight.

28:47.880 --> 28:49.917
Where?

29:02.880 --> 29:06.191
Boys and girls,
your ride's here.

29:09.520 --> 29:11.034
What the hell?

29:14.760 --> 29:16.717
Everybody get back!

29:28.360 --> 29:30.431
Thank you, Flash,

29:30.520 --> 29:33.558
for bringing them all to me.

29:40.400 --> 29:42.119
The chopper's
not going to be able to land.

29:42.200 --> 29:44.476
Take everybody out the back
and get them on it somehow.

29:44.560 --> 29:45.710
Come on.

29:47.520 --> 29:50.797
No, he's mine.

29:50.880 --> 29:51.996
Hyah!

30:07.120 --> 30:08.952
All right, we're out
of the dampening field.

30:09.600 --> 30:11.512
Shawna, can you help?

30:11.600 --> 30:13.398
Every meta for themselves.

30:17.720 --> 30:19.552
What now?

30:20.320 --> 30:22.755
I don't suppose you can
run up my arm, can you?

30:22.880 --> 30:24.633
Ralph,
what are you planning to do?

30:24.720 --> 30:26.234
Remember, Baby Giraffe,

30:26.320 --> 30:28.073
they took a leap of faith
with you.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.834
That's why I'm going to take
a leap for them, Shirley.

30:30.920 --> 30:33.389
All right, everybody.
Straight line, single file,

30:33.480 --> 30:34.630
tuck your arms in.

30:45.680 --> 30:47.876
- Keep this thing steady.
- Roger that.

30:54.640 --> 30:56.120
Stand there!

30:56.200 --> 30:58.351
Tuck your arms.

31:28.080 --> 31:30.549
You can't win this fight.

31:30.640 --> 31:32.552
I bet I can.

31:32.640 --> 31:35.109
We haven't been
formally introduced.

31:35.200 --> 31:38.716
They call me Killer Frost.
Let me show you why.

31:52.880 --> 31:54.075
Ah!

32:00.080 --> 32:01.753
Ugh.

32:19.600 --> 32:22.160
<i>Killer Frost, duck!</i>

32:39.880 --> 32:43.635
- You saved me.
- You saved them first.

32:43.720 --> 32:45.200
Nice work.

32:45.280 --> 32:47.670
<i>Let's get out of here for real!</i>

33:00.880 --> 33:02.917
Give him hell, Flash!

33:07.240 --> 33:08.993
Okay, you see,
the metas are on the move.

33:09.080 --> 33:10.958
- Bravo.
- Something's wrong with Barry.

33:11.040 --> 33:12.040
What?

33:12.120 --> 33:14.635
I've never seen these kind
of readings from Barry's suit.

33:16.360 --> 33:19.398
He's channeling over 2.86
billion joules of energy.

33:19.480 --> 33:21.119
That's a combined equivalent

33:21.200 --> 33:22.873
of... of almost
three lightning bolts.

33:22.960 --> 33:24.952
Cicada's powers allow him
to sustain injury

33:25.040 --> 33:26.838
- but not that much.
- Barry.

33:26.920 --> 33:29.640
<i>Barry.</i>

33:38.600 --> 33:40.193
He's not going to stop.

33:42.280 --> 33:45.956
You're never gonna hurt
my daughter again!

33:49.280 --> 33:50.873
- Aah!
- Dad!

33:52.560 --> 33:53.755
No.

34:15.400 --> 34:18.313
Oh, I'm sorry.
I let him get away.

34:18.880 --> 34:22.715
No, you brought me back.

34:35.239 --> 34:36.833
Alright, the Feds
have processed Norvock

34:36.920 --> 34:39.196
and the other metas,
giving them new identities,

34:39.280 --> 34:41.192
so everybody's safe.

34:41.280 --> 34:43.670
Satellite hasn't registered
any unaccounted-for dark matter

34:43.760 --> 34:46.400
so, wherever Dwyer is,
his dagger's not in use.

34:46.520 --> 34:49.558
Psh, after the beating Barry
gave him, ain't no way

34:49.639 --> 34:52.030
he's using that dagger
anytime soon.

34:54.639 --> 34:57.838
What?
He got what he deserved.

34:57.920 --> 35:01.277
Oh, no, I think
we appreciate your groove.

35:01.360 --> 35:04.990
Also I think that Killer Frost
and the Flash combination is

35:05.120 --> 35:07.237
enough to maybe have Dwyer
not want to show his face

35:07.320 --> 35:08.800
<i>around here any time soon.</i>

35:08.880 --> 35:10.234
Dad, are you okay?

35:10.320 --> 35:11.549
I'm good.

35:11.640 --> 35:13.552
What matters
is that you're okay.

35:15.160 --> 35:16.376
How's it feel
to be up and running again?

35:16.400 --> 35:17.914
Super frickin' schway.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.435
Uh, wanna know what's
not super frickin' schway?

35:20.520 --> 35:22.796
Cicada knowing exactly
when and where

35:22.880 --> 35:24.394
our secret transport
was taking place.

35:24.480 --> 35:27.678
Mm.
Inside job, right?

35:27.760 --> 35:31.640
Cicada clearly has
a inside man, only...

35:31.720 --> 35:33.996
Only what kind of cop
would help Cicada

35:34.080 --> 35:35.355
kill innocent people?

35:37.280 --> 35:40.796
One that's going to have to
answer to D.A. Cecile Horton.

35:42.560 --> 35:44.597
Captain,
you wanted to see me?

35:44.680 --> 35:46.717
Come on in.

35:46.800 --> 35:48.154
Officer Jones,

35:48.240 --> 35:49.913
this was printed
off of your hard drive.

35:50.040 --> 35:52.714
Copy of the list of metas
that Cicada's been pursuing.

35:52.800 --> 35:55.315
Funny thing,
it is the same list

35:55.400 --> 35:56.754
that we know you accessed

35:56.880 --> 35:59.031
on your home computer
just this week.

35:59.120 --> 36:00.256
Care to tell me
why you decided

36:00.280 --> 36:01.953
to aid and abet
a murderer?

36:02.040 --> 36:04.635
No, that's not... you don't
know what you're talking about.

36:04.720 --> 36:06.279
Really?

36:07.360 --> 36:11.320
A woman used meta-human tech
to take control of your mind.

36:11.400 --> 36:13.835
She made you do things
that you were certain

36:13.920 --> 36:16.913
you would never do.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.957
And that frightened you,
didn't it?

36:19.040 --> 36:21.680
It frightened you
and it made you angry,

36:21.760 --> 36:24.400
and you went ahead
and you embraced that anger

36:24.480 --> 36:26.836
and you let it
drive your every move.

36:26.920 --> 36:30.436
Betrayal.
Revenge.

36:33.480 --> 36:34.914
Escape.

36:41.240 --> 36:45.314
The metas in this city
have no respect for human life.

36:45.400 --> 36:47.471
They don't deserve
to breathe our air.

36:47.600 --> 36:50.240
You swore an oath to protect
the citizens of this city.

36:50.320 --> 36:52.277
Every one of them.

36:54.240 --> 36:57.199
Get him out of my sight.

37:04.280 --> 37:06.590
You know, your instincts
have always been sharp.

37:06.680 --> 37:08.911
But knowing he was going
to try to escape?

37:09.000 --> 37:11.469
Could have sworn you were
reading Jonesy's mind.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.798
It's a funny thing, yeah.

37:18.920 --> 37:21.674
Since Jenna was born,
I've been

37:21.800 --> 37:23.678
a lot more in touch
with my feelings.

37:25.600 --> 37:28.035
When Joe gets back,
the two of you

37:28.120 --> 37:30.874
will be a force
to be reckoned with.

37:30.960 --> 37:33.191
Oh, we already are.

37:42.800 --> 37:45.599
Killer Frost,
you shouldn't have.

37:45.680 --> 37:46.776
<i>It's the closest
you're getting</i>

37:46.800 --> 37:49.110
<i>to an apology from me,
so...</i>

37:49.680 --> 37:52.195
Well, maybe that's why
I can hear you

37:52.280 --> 37:54.590
without the M.A.D. 2.0.

37:54.680 --> 37:56.592
Or maybe it's because
you've stopped hating me.

37:56.680 --> 37:57.680
<i>I didn't hate you.</i>

37:57.760 --> 37:59.274
<i>I thought
you were being stupid.</i>

37:59.360 --> 38:02.034
<i>There's a difference.</i>

38:02.120 --> 38:04.635
Hey, you know I'd never take
that cure, right?

38:04.760 --> 38:06.399
<i>Even if it means sharing
a body with me</i>

38:06.480 --> 38:08.312
<i>until you get old and grey?</i>

38:08.400 --> 38:09.800
Of course.

38:09.880 --> 38:12.554
You're a part of me
that I never want to lose.

38:12.640 --> 38:16.475
I promise, I will do everything
I can to protect you.

38:16.560 --> 38:18.916
<i>Right back at you, Caity.</i>

38:19.000 --> 38:20.480
<i>Now, don't get all soft on me,</i>

38:20.560 --> 38:21.776
<i>but I got you
a little something.</i>

38:21.800 --> 38:24.474
<i>Check the cooler.</i>

38:34.560 --> 38:38.554
Hey, Frosty.
Oh, Caitlin.

38:38.640 --> 38:42.919
Is that a ball of ice
with blood inside of it?

38:43.000 --> 38:45.640
I think Killer Frost
took it from Cicada.

38:46.160 --> 38:48.311
Ralph, this isn't just blood.

38:48.960 --> 38:52.431
This is a DNA sample from
a recently created meta-human.

38:54.240 --> 38:57.074
- So Killer Frost came around.
- Yeah.

38:57.160 --> 38:58.674
She did.

38:58.760 --> 39:00.336
<i>Ugh, I said don't get soft.</i>

39:02.720 --> 39:06.396
<i>Begin handwriting analysis.</i>

39:14.800 --> 39:18.430
<i>As I suspected,
the journal of Nora West Allen</i>

39:18.520 --> 39:21.115
<i>contains two
different types of handwriting.</i>

39:21.680 --> 39:23.592
So...

39:25.680 --> 39:29.356
There is a mastermind
behind the scenes.

39:29.440 --> 39:32.512
The only question is...

39:32.640 --> 39:34.074
who?

39:43.040 --> 39:47.239
Okay, 47 tacos
is officially my limit.

39:47.360 --> 39:49.795
I think that's
anyone's limit, honey.

39:49.880 --> 39:51.599
A healing speedster's
gotta eat.

39:51.680 --> 39:55.117
Healed, Dad.
I'm fine.

39:55.200 --> 39:56.634
I promise.

39:56.720 --> 39:59.360
Hey, uh,
dinner again tomorrow night?

39:59.440 --> 40:03.195
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Nora? Um...

40:03.280 --> 40:05.715
I just...

40:05.840 --> 40:08.719
just want you to know
how much we love you.

40:24.080 --> 40:27.869
See?
She's back to her old self.

40:27.960 --> 40:30.839
And so are you.

40:30.920 --> 40:34.436
No, I'm not.

40:34.520 --> 40:37.160
In fact, I don't think
I'll ever be the same.

40:39.680 --> 40:43.356
All of this has made me realize
that, I don't know,

40:43.440 --> 40:47.400
I just... I never knew I was
capable of even caring

40:47.480 --> 40:50.200
for someone as much
as I care about Nora.

40:51.920 --> 40:53.559
I did.

40:54.920 --> 40:58.231
I've never met anyone with
a bigger heart than you, Barry.

40:58.960 --> 41:00.917
So it's no surprise to me
that you are

41:01.000 --> 41:04.357
a fantastic father.

41:04.480 --> 41:07.040
Just like you're
a fantastic husband.

41:10.840 --> 41:13.150
Cicada's a father, too.

41:15.120 --> 41:18.716
What if the key to defeating
him is appealing to his heart?

41:18.800 --> 41:21.554
How do we do that?
By saving his child.

41:24.600 --> 41:26.319
We need to wake up Grace.

42:23.120 --> 42:24.554
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
