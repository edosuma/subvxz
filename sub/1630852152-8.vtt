WEBVTT

00:17.727 --> 00:18.561
Thank you.

00:23.899 --> 00:24.900
Drink it. It's good.

00:26.235 --> 00:29.196
Buddy, you got any <i>aguardiente?</i>

00:30.823 --> 00:31.907
The heat's terrible, huh?

00:33.200 --> 00:35.369
It's scorching here
and freezing in Bogotá.

00:35.411 --> 00:36.871
Who can understand that, man?

00:36.912 --> 00:39.749
I put ice in my coffee.
I don't like burning my tongue.

00:40.916 --> 00:42.877
In other words, I don't
like extremes.

00:42.918 --> 00:45.755
Don't worry, we'll go back
to Bogotá tomorrow.

00:45.796 --> 00:46.464
No, I'm leaving today.

00:47.715 --> 00:50.718
My idiot son got into
problems over money.

00:51.594 --> 00:52.928
I have to go fix that mess.

00:55.681 --> 00:58.768
You know I'd help, but this is
the last I have left.

00:58.809 --> 01:01.437
I know. Close that deal.

01:01.479 --> 01:02.021
Then give me a job.

01:03.564 --> 01:06.358
Maybe I can be your bodyguard again,
after 15 years.

01:09.361 --> 01:10.196
That's the plan.

01:11.697 --> 01:13.949
What did you find out?
Does the deal look clean?

01:14.825 --> 01:15.951
That's how it looks.

01:16.702 --> 01:18.662
The man's name is Assaf.

01:19.789 --> 01:21.415
And he's a mystery.

01:22.416 --> 01:23.793
Nobody knows anything about him.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.921
He just goes to town to
buy some things.

01:27.963 --> 01:29.215
Is he connected to any mafias?

01:30.674 --> 01:34.553
No. The information they gave
Félix was not correct.

01:36.180 --> 01:37.723
And Félix?

01:38.682 --> 01:39.850
Is he trustworthy?

01:41.477 --> 01:42.853
Isn't he your friend?

01:44.605 --> 01:46.857
From school,
but I haven't seen him in years.

01:48.192 --> 01:50.569
You know you can't trust anyone
in this country.

01:53.697 --> 01:54.740
Let's see.

01:55.908 --> 01:57.368
Your friend doesn't owe money.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.246
He doesn't mess with anyone.

02:00.287 --> 02:02.122
In town, they say

02:02.164 --> 02:04.208
he's a rich kid from Bogotá

02:05.292 --> 02:07.378
who's pretending to
be a poor kid.

02:07.419 --> 02:10.422
So it's safe to make the deal
and buy the seeds from Assaf?

02:14.593 --> 02:16.971
You don't know the horse
until you ride it.

02:17.012 --> 02:18.389
What's wrong with you, idiot?

02:18.430 --> 02:20.850
Calm down.
Here's the situation.

02:22.309 --> 02:25.145
You think this is the golf course
your aunts go to?

02:25.771 --> 02:26.397
No, sir.

02:27.189 --> 02:29.441
You've seen those old westerns?

02:30.818 --> 02:33.696
Where there's no God or law?
It's the same here.

02:35.322 --> 02:38.909
Here, they'll slash your mom's
head open with a machete

02:38.951 --> 02:40.786
for less than what's
in that bag.

02:42.413 --> 02:43.414
Look, son,

02:44.164 --> 02:47.042
try to close that deal
and don't hand over the money

02:47.084 --> 02:48.794
until you have the
seeds in hand.

02:50.421 --> 02:51.255
Got it?

02:52.047 --> 02:53.007
Yes.

02:54.508 --> 02:55.342
Cheers.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.155
And that guy? Who was he?

03:18.866 --> 03:22.036
He was offering me a tour
to go see dolphins.

03:25.164 --> 03:26.165
The money's in there?

03:31.378 --> 03:33.505
- The fuck, Nacho?
- It's to be safe.

03:33.547 --> 03:34.506
It's like the Wild West.

03:36.008 --> 03:38.969
You know the mess we'd be in
if Assaf sees we're armed?

03:39.011 --> 03:41.931
If Assaf realizes we're armed,
that means we need it.

03:43.015 --> 03:44.683
And better safe than sorry,
right?

05:09.226 --> 05:11.353
Félix asked me to give you this.

05:15.190 --> 05:16.191
Where is he?

05:19.445 --> 05:21.113
I dunno. I saw him last night.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.659
I'm very worried about him.

05:27.244 --> 05:28.704
You know he always disappears.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.711
I'll see you tonight for
the dinner, yeah?

05:38.714 --> 05:40.132
I'll be there at seven.

05:40.174 --> 05:41.133
Ignacio.

05:47.056 --> 05:48.182
You okay?

05:49.099 --> 05:50.059
I don't know.

05:52.394 --> 05:53.437
Need to talk?

05:55.355 --> 05:58.150
I need men to stop telling me
what to do with my life.

06:02.071 --> 06:05.699
If you want, I can help you decide
with my absence.

06:07.201 --> 06:08.619
How's that work?

06:10.287 --> 06:13.290
The perfect man stays
silent and listens.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.210
That's what they say, right?

06:17.753 --> 06:19.213
Silent?

06:19.963 --> 06:22.341
Ignacio Santamaría? Wow!

06:30.974 --> 06:31.934
Okay.

06:37.981 --> 06:39.441
Where to start?

06:51.870 --> 06:53.497
Here's the issue.

06:56.625 --> 06:57.835
My dad

06:57.876 --> 07:00.254
wants me to give his company
all of my land,

07:00.295 --> 07:03.173
which is crazy because
it's my land.

07:03.215 --> 07:04.925
It's my inheritance from my mom.

07:05.676 --> 07:06.760
On the other hand,

07:07.594 --> 07:08.428
if I don't do this...

07:09.805 --> 07:13.225
it's true Rosalía might go bankrupt
immediately.

07:13.267 --> 07:16.687
And I'd feel like shit if
that happened.

07:18.689 --> 07:21.984
But the thing is,
with or without my land,

07:22.025 --> 07:24.236
that company doesn't
have much future.

07:24.278 --> 07:26.446
The way they're doing things...

07:27.698 --> 07:30.534
isn't going anywhere.

07:34.496 --> 07:36.748
And it also feels strange

07:36.790 --> 07:40.419
to be thinking so much
about a flower company's land

07:40.460 --> 07:44.756
when I should be fully focused
on KannaLab now, you know?

07:52.431 --> 07:55.934
Maybe you heard of Alex Honnold?

07:57.144 --> 07:59.855
He's a free-solo rock climber.

07:59.897 --> 08:00.981
Without any lifeline.

08:01.899 --> 08:03.358
He's like Superman.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.819
Each step he takes up
there is perfect.

08:05.861 --> 08:09.364
It has to be, or he'd smash
onto the rocks and die.

08:10.407 --> 08:11.950
But I'm sure that,

08:12.868 --> 08:15.621
if he knew he had a lifeline,

08:15.662 --> 08:17.789
a rope holding him up,

08:17.831 --> 08:19.833
he'd allow himself to
make mistakes.

08:20.959 --> 08:22.502
Like the rest of us.

08:28.258 --> 08:29.343
That land...

08:31.970 --> 08:34.348
is my lifeline, Ignacio.

08:36.016 --> 08:36.683
That's what's stopping me

08:37.976 --> 08:41.855
from crashing onto the rocks
if I fall here.

08:41.897 --> 08:43.440
So the real question is...

08:47.110 --> 08:48.111
Do I...

08:49.321 --> 08:51.365
want to take perfect steps,

08:53.158 --> 08:56.036
or do I want to keep thinking
about that damn rope?

08:56.954 --> 08:58.705
Each time I ask myself this

08:58.747 --> 09:02.626
the answer looks so clear,
so obvious.

09:03.961 --> 09:04.586
But...

09:06.171 --> 09:09.591
Whenever I think about the
papers they want me to sign,

09:13.345 --> 09:15.264
the situation gets muddy...

09:18.350 --> 09:19.935
And that clarity...

09:25.065 --> 09:27.401
That clarity disappears.

09:36.535 --> 09:37.953
So I don't know what to do.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.049
Where are you going?

09:52.884 --> 09:54.594
It was a pleasure to help.

09:54.636 --> 09:57.723
What're you talking about? You
didn't say anything. I need answers.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.599
You know what you have to do.

10:00.767 --> 10:02.519
And you have the
ovaries to do it.

10:07.399 --> 10:08.483
See you tonight.

10:45.270 --> 10:48.482
DON'T SMOKE AND DRINK

11:37.572 --> 11:38.073
Espinoza.

11:38.115 --> 11:39.825
Yeah.

11:39.866 --> 11:43.328
I'm bringing in a woman from
Bogotá. She won't stop asking crap.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.707
Buddy, can't you see I'm busy?

11:47.749 --> 11:48.667
I'm up to my neck.

11:49.835 --> 11:52.504
I have a triple homicide
at El Rodadero.

11:52.546 --> 11:54.714
If you want, I'll take care of her
and you go there

11:54.756 --> 11:56.466
to handle that shit, yeah?

11:58.885 --> 12:00.053
Let her in.

12:10.605 --> 12:12.482
Maybe you can finally give
me information.

12:13.650 --> 12:14.609
First we greet each other.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.989
I've been greeting people all morning
and nobody helped.

12:25.370 --> 12:26.246
Good morning.

12:27.372 --> 12:29.749
Good morning. How
may I help you?

12:31.877 --> 12:33.336
It's about a case that
happened nearby.

12:34.880 --> 12:40.135
Honestly, I'd love to help,
but right now I'm very busy.

12:40.177 --> 12:45.098
Come back tomorrow
and I'll be happy to help.

12:50.479 --> 12:52.063
Where's the DA? I'll
talk to him.

12:54.941 --> 12:57.402
He's out on a catamaran.

12:57.444 --> 12:58.445
A catamaran?

12:58.487 --> 13:01.031
Yes. A catamaran is
like a boat...

13:01.072 --> 13:02.866
I know what a catamaran is.

13:02.908 --> 13:05.911
What I don't get is why the DA is
out on a catamaran on a Thursday.

13:05.952 --> 13:08.371
Here we usually enjoy life.

13:09.748 --> 13:11.333
Unless I'm mistaken,

13:11.374 --> 13:14.085
I think he'll be back
in a couple of weeks.

13:20.091 --> 13:21.718
- Are all these homicides?
- Yes.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.099
Don't you have a digital file?

13:28.141 --> 13:29.142
No.

13:29.434 --> 13:32.354
The computers and the
system broke down.

13:32.395 --> 13:34.606
- You don't have another system?
- God, lady!

13:34.648 --> 13:36.525
Can't you see I'm busy?
What do you want?

13:36.566 --> 13:37.400
I'm researching the case
of the Israeli.

13:39.361 --> 13:43.031
He was killed here, in Tayrona. The
body was found a couple of weeks ago.

13:43.073 --> 13:45.200
I have to see the
forensic report.

13:45.242 --> 13:47.661
You can't see the
forensic report.

13:47.702 --> 13:50.163
Can you at least tell me
where he was found?

13:50.205 --> 13:53.583
No, I can't tell you
where he was found.

13:59.422 --> 14:00.715
What's your name?

14:01.925 --> 14:02.676
Héctor Espinoza.

14:04.094 --> 14:06.179
Espinoza, I don't want to get you
in trouble.

14:10.350 --> 14:13.645
Don't be naive.
You won't get me in trouble.

14:14.646 --> 14:16.231
I'll explain.

14:16.273 --> 14:19.150
- I work for a newspaper, <i>Portal</i> <i>Capital</i>.
- So?

14:19.192 --> 14:22.112
We're investigating this case. The
article will be out in two weeks.

14:23.738 --> 14:26.199
When half the country's talking
about what really happened,

14:26.241 --> 14:29.160
and they see you could've helped
but didn't want to,

14:29.202 --> 14:31.079
I think you'll be in trouble.

14:34.291 --> 14:35.333
Who's the naive one?

14:37.794 --> 14:40.422
You should know better
newspapers have threatened me.

14:44.175 --> 14:48.930
I don't think any half-decent newspaper
would send anyone to this shithole.

14:54.769 --> 14:55.645
What's your name?

14:57.022 --> 14:58.106
Lola.

14:59.649 --> 15:02.777
Lola, you're what we
call an asshole.

15:03.820 --> 15:06.239
And nobody helps an asshole.

15:16.458 --> 15:20.211
Buddy, I'll be taking a dump,
in case anyone asks for me.

15:37.646 --> 15:40.607
<i>Félix, where are you?</i>

15:41.858 --> 15:44.194
<i>I've been looking
everywhere for you.</i>

15:44.235 --> 15:45.278
<i>Hey, thanks for the weed.</i>

15:46.529 --> 15:50.784
<i>I'll be more careful this time.
I promise.</i>

15:50.825 --> 15:54.913
<i>I'm celebrating my birthday
at that restaurant we like.</i>

15:57.499 --> 15:58.375
<i>I want you to come.</i>

16:00.835 --> 16:02.462
<i>I want to celebrate with you.</i>

16:04.964 --> 16:07.175
<i>And I also spoke with Ignacio.</i>

16:08.093 --> 16:10.845
<i>And he told me the journalist</i>

16:10.887 --> 16:15.016
<i>isn't investigating
what we thought she was.</i>

16:15.767 --> 16:17.060
<i>Everything's okay.</i>

16:18.395 --> 16:23.817
<i>I... I know I don't have
any proof, but...</i>

16:34.744 --> 16:38.415
<i>Believe me. You didn't do
what you think you did.</i>

16:38.456 --> 16:40.041
<i>I know you couldn't have.</i>

17:12.824 --> 17:14.868
Why do you care so much
about this case?

17:15.702 --> 17:17.162
All cases are important.

17:18.413 --> 17:20.582
I have 50 other unsolved cases.

17:20.623 --> 17:22.041
And more heinous than that one.

17:23.042 --> 17:26.171
But you don't care about those. You're
asking about one in particular.

17:27.380 --> 17:30.008
I need to get to the
bottom of this one.

17:30.049 --> 17:30.967
You reached the bottom.

17:32.218 --> 17:34.554
That Israeli got killed to
settle a score.

17:34.596 --> 17:35.722
Settle a score? Who?

17:37.515 --> 17:40.059
Probably one of the
gangs in the area.

17:41.436 --> 17:43.021
- Probably?
- Yes.

17:43.062 --> 17:43.897
Probably.

17:44.981 --> 17:47.358
That's what the DA
will determine.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.653
You see, 97% of homicides here
are for the same reason.

17:50.695 --> 17:52.405
Can you check the report again?

17:52.447 --> 17:54.073
I've been checking
all afternoon.

17:54.115 --> 17:55.492
I thought you were shitting?

17:58.411 --> 17:59.162
Just drop it, honey.

18:00.622 --> 18:03.958
Things are as they are,
not how you want them to be.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.961
When you don't get that, your
speculations make you spiral

18:08.087 --> 18:10.215
down, down, until you
can't turn back.

18:11.716 --> 18:12.592
Don't believe me?

18:14.093 --> 18:15.970
Look at the shithole
you ended up in.

18:17.347 --> 18:19.265
If this isn't the bottom,
then what is it?

18:20.517 --> 18:22.894
And that's coming from me.
I'm stuck here.

18:25.647 --> 18:28.399
Why don't you go for a ride
on a catamaran like the DA?

18:30.235 --> 18:36.699
Enjoy the afternoon, the beach,
dip your feet in the water, relax.

18:36.741 --> 18:40.036
And stop obsessing over this.
It's a closed case.

18:41.246 --> 18:42.622
There's nothing else to dig up.

18:49.754 --> 18:51.297
Let's go, we're locking up.

19:23.913 --> 19:24.956
Happy birthday.

19:25.874 --> 19:27.000
Thank you.

19:28.918 --> 19:30.336
You got here earlier.

19:30.378 --> 19:31.963
Yes, I left early.

19:33.548 --> 19:34.757
Well, welcome.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.178
Let's go sit, yeah?

19:39.220 --> 19:40.597
Of course.

19:42.307 --> 19:43.975
Hi. It's great you could come.

19:45.643 --> 19:47.604
Your partner made it earlier.

19:47.645 --> 19:48.771
Hey.

19:48.813 --> 19:50.565
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

19:50.607 --> 19:53.443
It's great to see you here.
Ignacio, just a second, please.

19:53.484 --> 19:54.569
But I'm...

19:55.820 --> 19:58.114
- Go.
- It's just a second.

20:04.787 --> 20:07.874
Nothing about Félix yet?
He hasn't shown up.

20:12.462 --> 20:13.922
What's going on?

20:16.257 --> 20:19.761
I don't think your birthday party
is the best time to discuss this.

20:20.970 --> 20:22.138
Discuss what?

20:26.851 --> 20:28.227
Look, Félix...

20:30.939 --> 20:32.982
Félix turned himself in
this afternoon.

20:34.359 --> 20:35.818
What?

20:35.860 --> 20:38.780
Yes, he confessed everything.
He said he was responsible

20:40.365 --> 20:41.199
for the passing.

20:42.450 --> 20:43.743
- Passing?
- You know.

20:44.911 --> 20:47.538
The passing of the
descendent of Jacob.

20:48.289 --> 20:49.874
The fuck are you saying?

20:49.916 --> 20:53.086
- What descendent?
- The Israeli. Calm down. Lower your voice.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.381
It's all under control,
don't worry.

20:56.422 --> 20:58.716
What exactly is under control,
Ignacio?

20:58.758 --> 21:02.178
He'll take responsibility
for everything, we'll be clean.

21:02.220 --> 21:03.763
You're fucking with me, please.

21:03.805 --> 21:05.556
I told you this isn't
the right time.

21:09.185 --> 21:11.229
Ignacio, where's Félix?

21:11.270 --> 21:15.525
I told you. He's with the police,
confessing everything. Calm down, Mariana.

21:16.359 --> 21:17.235
Mari.

21:18.486 --> 21:19.862
Just a second, please.

21:19.904 --> 21:21.739
No, let's sit down, yeah.
Shall we sit down?

21:21.781 --> 21:22.740
Let's sit.

21:24.826 --> 21:27.328
Is Félix coming, to
save him a seat?

21:29.414 --> 21:30.248
Don't worry.

21:34.961 --> 21:35.795
Mari.

21:43.469 --> 21:46.472
I'm so glad you could come.
Thank you for being here.

21:46.514 --> 21:49.392
Yes. Let's toast to the
birthday girl,

21:50.476 --> 21:51.310
Mariana.

21:52.895 --> 21:54.564
What do you say in
this situation?

21:56.441 --> 21:57.442
There's lots of love here.

21:58.151 --> 22:01.362
And... in all the time
I've known Mariana,

22:02.739 --> 22:03.698
she's changed my life.

22:05.324 --> 22:09.412
And yes, we're like any other couple,
with our problems,

22:09.454 --> 22:12.206
our ups and downs,
our differences.

22:12.248 --> 22:13.916
But, as I said, with
lots of love.

22:14.834 --> 22:15.543
If it weren't for her,

22:17.003 --> 22:19.714
I think the world, as I know it,
wouldn't be the same.

22:21.257 --> 22:23.634
It wouldn't be such a beautiful
place to grow old in.

22:25.303 --> 22:29.682
So, thank you all for being
here. And thank you, my love.

22:31.017 --> 22:33.853
Happy birthday, Mariana.
May you have many more.

22:33.895 --> 22:35.396
- Cheers.
- For Mari.

22:35.438 --> 22:37.607
Thank you for coming. Thank you,
my love.

22:37.648 --> 22:38.483
Thank you.

22:45.531 --> 22:46.240
Where were we?

22:47.533 --> 22:51.204
How long ago did you arrive
from the airport?

23:06.552 --> 23:07.762
Please...

23:18.314 --> 23:19.148
Mari.

23:20.066 --> 23:20.983
Yes?

23:22.110 --> 23:22.944
Everything okay?

23:23.736 --> 23:25.655
Yes, everything's okay.

23:28.991 --> 23:30.785
If it's about this
morning's fight,

23:31.911 --> 23:34.288
I really don't want to
ruin your night.

23:36.499 --> 23:37.458
Let's forget about it.

23:38.626 --> 23:43.214
I know you've had
some very tough weeks,

23:43.256 --> 23:44.924
some very stressful days.

23:46.717 --> 23:49.137
So, I don't know,
let's make the most of this

23:50.596 --> 23:53.683
so you can relax a
bit and unwind.

23:53.724 --> 23:56.853
All these people are
here to see you.

23:56.894 --> 23:57.979
It's your night.

24:01.149 --> 24:02.066
Yeah?

24:04.902 --> 24:05.736
Yeah.

24:06.571 --> 24:08.781
Let's go sit. Enough.

24:08.823 --> 24:10.283
Okay.

24:13.494 --> 24:17.582
So, if I understand, the star generates
light, the light generates more gravity...

24:17.623 --> 24:20.334
- and the gravity compresses...
- Just a sec, Ignacio.

24:20.376 --> 24:22.503
Can't I have a
conversation in peace?

24:22.545 --> 24:25.047
I'm sorry. It's very urgent.
Please.

24:25.089 --> 24:28.217
Look, if it's about
what I think...

24:28.259 --> 24:29.886
- That can wait.
- No, it can't.

24:29.927 --> 24:31.679
We can't do anything, Mari.

24:31.721 --> 24:34.473
Why don't you go take your seat?

24:34.515 --> 24:35.558
Mari.

24:35.600 --> 24:38.144
Since we're all here,

24:38.186 --> 24:40.188
why don't we tell the
story of how we met?

24:40.229 --> 24:41.647
Yes, Mari.

24:41.689 --> 24:44.108
Why don't you take your seat
and tell the story?

24:45.026 --> 24:45.943
From over there.

24:50.364 --> 24:53.034
Why don't you tell it?
You tell it so nicely.

24:53.910 --> 24:55.411
No, so do you.

24:58.206 --> 25:01.834
Okay. It's your birthday.
Your wish is my command.

25:02.668 --> 25:03.711
Uh...

25:04.462 --> 25:06.339
We met in Cartagena.

25:06.380 --> 25:10.843
I had a conference. Virgilio
was also there, Mariana's dad.

25:10.885 --> 25:13.429
And they invited me

25:13.471 --> 25:16.557
to go around the islands
in Virgilio's yacht.

25:16.599 --> 25:19.977
I get terribly seasick.

25:20.019 --> 25:21.562
Yeah, so...

25:21.604 --> 25:24.023
I had a headache,

25:24.065 --> 25:27.318
because of the waves.
So, I had a terrible headache.

25:27.360 --> 25:30.404
I had to get away from everyone.

25:30.446 --> 25:33.574
When I reached the stern,
there she was.

25:45.586 --> 25:47.463
Oh, Félix, you made it.

25:47.505 --> 25:50.091
Great, so you can hear
the end of the story.

25:51.300 --> 25:53.219
So great you could come, bud.
Welcome.

25:54.512 --> 25:57.056
So Mariana looked very pale,

25:57.098 --> 25:59.892
- she was seasick, and so was I.
- Happy Birthday.

26:01.978 --> 26:06.107
And... I went to see if I
could help her.

26:06.148 --> 26:08.859
And she threw up all over me.
Top to bottom.

26:09.860 --> 26:12.029
And I was trying

26:12.071 --> 26:14.407
to clean her up, clean myself up,
we got to talking,

26:15.032 --> 26:17.368
and here we are.

26:17.410 --> 26:18.577
That's the story.

26:18.619 --> 26:20.454
Can we switch seats
for a second?

26:20.496 --> 26:21.664
No, you're fine there, yeah?

26:21.706 --> 26:23.916
Let her decide. Just a second.

26:23.958 --> 26:25.501
Yes, that's okay.

26:33.217 --> 26:35.928
Do you have an
explanation for this?

26:35.970 --> 26:38.472
Yes, I do, but I won't tell you.

26:40.850 --> 26:42.184
This will have to wait.

26:43.436 --> 26:46.105
Wait? Until when?

26:46.147 --> 26:47.940
Until things are more
clear to me.

26:50.401 --> 26:52.403
Let's go out for some fresh air.

26:52.445 --> 26:54.363
No, I'm perfectly fine here.

27:01.245 --> 27:03.164
Mari, I got a message a
few minutes ago,

27:03.205 --> 27:05.082
it seems there's an issue
with the crops.

27:05.124 --> 27:06.292
Do you know the brand

27:06.334 --> 27:08.085
- of fertilizer we use?
- What're you saying?

27:08.127 --> 27:09.420
Mari knows.

27:11.380 --> 27:12.715
Yes, uh...

27:12.757 --> 27:15.343
This already happened
with another manure, right?

27:15.384 --> 27:16.969
Are you going to
discuss this here?

27:17.011 --> 27:19.764
Lucas, I'm sorry. But
it's urgent.

27:22.516 --> 27:24.518
Let's go outside so we
don't bother them.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.479
- Yes.
- Let's go.

27:26.520 --> 27:30.107
No, I'm fine here.
I want to hear Lucas's stories.

27:32.526 --> 27:34.320
You already know those stories.

27:35.488 --> 27:36.530
Let's go.

27:55.216 --> 27:56.634
What's going on here?

27:56.675 --> 27:58.427
That's what I'd like to know.

27:58.469 --> 28:00.054
You were going to
turn yourself in?

28:00.846 --> 28:01.931
What were you thinking?

28:01.972 --> 28:03.599
He'll screw us all.

28:03.641 --> 28:05.726
What're you saying?
We're safe now.

28:05.768 --> 28:07.978
Safe? And the journalist?

28:08.020 --> 28:10.189
Ignacio said she wasn't
investigating us.

28:10.231 --> 28:13.067
And you believe this
fucking liar?

28:13.109 --> 28:15.528
He himself told me
she'd found a lot of stuff.

28:20.866 --> 28:21.951
Is that true?

28:25.663 --> 28:26.747
I didn't want to worry you.

28:26.789 --> 28:27.790
Worry me?

28:28.541 --> 28:31.293
When have you ever worried about
anyone other than yourself?

28:32.628 --> 28:34.380
When we were at the
hotel at Tayrona,

28:35.423 --> 28:37.883
you were with a guy.
Who was he?

28:39.260 --> 28:40.469
I don't know what you mean.

28:40.511 --> 28:42.304
You think I'm an idiot?

28:42.346 --> 28:44.682
When I saw the gun, you were with
someone. Who was he?

28:44.723 --> 28:45.975
I wasn't with anyone.

28:46.016 --> 28:48.602
Stop talking shit. He's
hiding something.

28:48.644 --> 28:50.604
All the drugs are
messing with your--

28:50.646 --> 28:53.190
Tell the truth
or I'll beat your fucking ass.

28:59.613 --> 29:00.948
What do you want me to say?

29:02.450 --> 29:03.492
Who killed Assaf?

29:10.916 --> 29:12.042
Ignacio doesn't know.

29:12.835 --> 29:14.170
Sure he does.

29:18.424 --> 29:20.801
He doesn't, because he
wasn't there.

29:23.137 --> 29:24.597
How do you know he wasn't?

29:31.020 --> 29:31.937
Because I did it.

29:34.607 --> 29:35.608
What?

29:36.859 --> 29:38.486
I had to get it off my chest.

29:40.362 --> 29:42.406
- What're you saying?
- I did it.

29:42.448 --> 29:43.574
I killed him.

29:47.119 --> 29:48.537
But it was an accident.

29:50.498 --> 29:51.457
An accident?

29:57.630 --> 29:58.881
I was...

30:01.050 --> 30:02.218
I was asleep.

30:12.353 --> 30:14.605
<i>I woke up around midnight.</i>

30:20.277 --> 30:21.570
<i>You were sleeping.</i>

30:30.287 --> 30:31.372
<i>I had to use the toilet.</i>

30:59.984 --> 31:03.237
<i>And when I... When I
left the bathroom,</i>

31:04.613 --> 31:07.283
<i>Assaf was on the phone,
he was telling someone</i>

31:07.324 --> 31:10.286
<i>that he'd keep the seeds
and steal our money.</i>

31:19.086 --> 31:20.671
He was going to take everything.

31:27.261 --> 31:28.095
And then,

31:29.054 --> 31:32.600
<i>Assaf noticed me there, and...</i>

31:32.641 --> 31:34.101
I screamed, I shouted for you,

31:34.935 --> 31:37.187
a ton of times, but you...

31:38.731 --> 31:39.732
You didn't hear me.

31:44.862 --> 31:47.364
<i>Then he threw me on the floor.</i>

32:36.497 --> 32:38.540
And then I realized...

32:40.250 --> 32:41.418
he was dead.

33:23.961 --> 33:26.004
It all happened so fast
in the greenhouse.

33:42.104 --> 33:42.938
Ignacio.

33:43.814 --> 33:45.274
Ignacio, wake up.

33:47.735 --> 33:48.986
We have to go.

33:55.701 --> 33:58.662
And you already know
the rest of the story.

34:08.797 --> 34:10.299
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

34:10.340 --> 34:11.550
I was very scared.

34:11.592 --> 34:14.261
Scared? Do you realize
what you got us into?

34:14.303 --> 34:15.387
It was an accident.

34:15.429 --> 34:17.473
Slipping in the shower
is an accident.

34:17.514 --> 34:19.600
Getting your head bashed in
is homicide, right?

34:19.641 --> 34:21.393
- It was self-defense.
- It was homicide.

34:23.896 --> 34:25.439
And only you are involved,
not us.

34:26.899 --> 34:29.318
- Because of your fucking lies!
- He was gonna rob us!

34:29.359 --> 34:32.029
Who knows what would've happened
if I hadn't found out.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.531
Maybe we would've ended up dead.

34:36.116 --> 34:37.242
Fucking hell.

34:39.953 --> 34:40.996
Félix...

34:42.706 --> 34:46.585
Fefe, look at me, please.

34:50.672 --> 34:52.007
I wanted to tell you.

34:52.758 --> 34:53.634
Really?

34:53.675 --> 34:55.677
I swear.

34:55.719 --> 34:59.056
Shouldn't you have told me
when I thought I killed him?

34:59.097 --> 35:02.726
I didn't know how. You think
it's easy? This is torturing me.

35:02.768 --> 35:03.977
Only you?

35:07.898 --> 35:09.733
I almost went to prison for you.

35:13.862 --> 35:16.782
No... Félix!

35:32.631 --> 35:34.758
Why are you telling us now?

35:37.594 --> 35:40.180
It was time you knew the truth.

35:40.222 --> 35:42.349
Or was it time to make
us accomplices?

35:42.391 --> 35:46.520
We've always been together in this,
whether you knew the truth or not.

35:46.562 --> 35:49.106
No, Mariana. You're
alone in this.

35:51.525 --> 35:53.360
Let's see if you
fucking understand.

35:56.029 --> 35:57.072
It's true.

36:02.244 --> 36:03.704
It's true you're accomplices.

36:07.916 --> 36:09.543
The three of us were there.

36:12.087 --> 36:13.505
The three of us went
to make a deal.

36:15.257 --> 36:18.719
And the three of us started a
company with a dead man's seed.

36:21.096 --> 36:24.266
If you think I'll say I
was there alone,

36:24.308 --> 36:29.771
and that Ignacio Santamaría had no idea
what was going on, you're very wrong.

36:30.564 --> 36:31.732
Are you threatening me?

36:32.900 --> 36:36.653
No. I'm just tired of you
making mistakes.

36:36.695 --> 36:37.821
What mistakes?

36:37.863 --> 36:40.073
The journalist, the police,
everything.

36:44.494 --> 36:48.081
Everything is at stake here.

36:51.001 --> 36:52.169
From now on,

36:53.629 --> 36:58.258
we take perfect steps,
or we all fall onto the rocks.

37:03.931 --> 37:05.140
We're together in this.

37:07.100 --> 37:10.938
If one falls, we all fall.

37:55.065 --> 37:56.149
Mari.

37:57.859 --> 37:58.694
Everything okay?

38:03.240 --> 38:05.617
You coming? It's time to sing
"Happy Birthday".

38:06.493 --> 38:08.203
Can you wait a moment?

38:08.245 --> 38:10.664
Everyone's leaving.
We're practically alone.

38:14.001 --> 38:15.293
Yeah?

40:12.119 --> 40:13.703
Make a wish.

40:22.170 --> 40:23.839
I'll sign the papers.
