WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:04.816
Previously on Mars.

00:05.746 --> 00:07.744
I will miss my sister,

00:07.751 --> 00:09.749
she's my heart and soul.

00:09.756 --> 00:11.729
For something
like this to work,

00:11.738 --> 00:12.790
it has to be personal.

00:12.793 --> 00:14.791
We had traveled
further than anyone ever

00:14.799 --> 00:16.747
had to get to Mars.

00:16.754 --> 00:19.739
But before we even
entered Mars's atmosphere

00:19.749 --> 00:21.731
it was like she was
trying to push us away.

00:21.739 --> 00:24.737
Retro
rockets about to fire.

00:26.764 --> 00:28.712
And
once we landed,

00:28.720 --> 00:29.744
she pushed even harder.

00:29.747 --> 00:30.796
What
is Ben's status?

00:32.768 --> 00:34.766
How far
did we overshoot?

00:34.773 --> 00:36.775
75.3 kilometers.

00:36.783 --> 00:38.719
Come on,
let's fix this.

00:38.726 --> 00:40.704
It's our guys up there.

00:40.714 --> 00:41.734
The
workshop module.

00:41.738 --> 00:42.766
What if they can
make it there?

00:42.770 --> 00:44.685
Live in it?

00:44.692 --> 00:47.698
They'd have a chance.

00:47.708 --> 00:48.765
Wheels 5 and 6 just locked.

00:48.769 --> 00:50.714
Suspension
system compromised.

00:50.721 --> 00:51.719
We have to walk.

00:51.722 --> 00:54.674
It's -35 degree.

00:54.685 --> 00:56.675
It will be -70 by nightfall.

00:56.682 --> 00:57.735
We'll freeze to
death out there.

00:57.739 --> 00:58.751
Jesus.

01:00.669 --> 01:01.697
Ben?

01:01.700 --> 01:04.660
Far off course,
we struggle to make our way

01:04.671 --> 01:05.744
to a temporary habitat.

01:05.748 --> 01:07.717
We
need to cut the suit.

01:07.724 --> 01:10.646
Fighting
just to stay alive.

01:10.658 --> 01:11.699
Dammit, Ben.

01:11.702 --> 01:13.721
Ben, stay with me.

01:13.729 --> 01:15.701
Come on, come on.

01:15.708 --> 01:20.646
Still our mission remained,
to find a safe haven for the

01:20.663 --> 01:22.678
first human
settlement on Mars.

01:27.691 --> 01:31.695
But getting there had
killed the best among us.

01:31.709 --> 01:36.617
I was in command now

01:36.635 --> 01:37.697
and I knew if we couldn't
find a permanent home

01:37.701 --> 01:42.667
in this place...

01:43.634 --> 01:48.629
the Mars Mission would die.

When did
you first know you wanted

03:17.544 --> 03:21.491
to go to Mars?

03:21.504 --> 03:24.489
When we were 6,
my sister and I were at the

03:24.500 --> 03:29.462
planetarium, and it
felt like we were looking

03:29.480 --> 03:32.511
at the planets.

03:36.437 --> 03:38.494
We had these alien dolls in
our hands that my mom had just

03:38.500 --> 03:43.441
bought us, and I told my
sister I was going up there,

03:43.459 --> 03:46.482
that I was going to Mars,

03:46.493 --> 03:51.464
and she said
she was coming with me.

03:53.445 --> 03:56.454
But when the call
came for this mission,

03:56.465 --> 04:01.411
only one of us was
going to be on that ship.

04:01.429 --> 04:04.439
They say twins have one mind.

04:04.450 --> 04:08.397
But it's sharing a heart
that's the problem.

04:08.410 --> 04:14.425
The only way to separate
it is to break it.

04:31.367 --> 04:35.355
We all knew someone
could die here.

04:35.370 --> 04:40.411
But no one ever thought
it would be Ben.

04:41.369 --> 04:44.412
We picked a place to
bury him outside camp

04:44.423 --> 04:50.317
out in the regolith.

04:50.339 --> 04:54.340
The sun makes this
pattern on the ground,

04:54.354 --> 04:58.387
when it sets
behind the cliffs.

05:04.385 --> 05:07.374
They're looking to me
for answers Joon,

05:07.385 --> 05:11.344
and I can see the
doubt in their eyes.

05:11.358 --> 05:13.360
I stay away from the
portholes because I'm afraid

05:13.367 --> 05:19.320
if I see my reflection
it will be in mine too.

05:19.342 --> 05:22.302
I need to be strong for them.

05:22.313 --> 05:26.268
As strong as he was.

05:26.282 --> 05:28.309
The repairs on
the rover are done.

05:28.315 --> 05:31.250
We're able to take what
we could from the original

05:31.262 --> 05:32.336
landing site, but the
workshop module's designed

05:32.344 --> 05:35.279
for 2 people
working 8 hours a day.

05:35.289 --> 05:38.241
Not a crew of 5 full time.

05:38.252 --> 05:40.292
Marta is preparing the drones
to start scanning surrounding

05:40.298 --> 05:42.320
lava tubes for ice and
the geology we need to

05:42.329 --> 05:44.286
deploy the dome.

05:44.292 --> 05:47.231
Javier is optimizing
WAVARs for water.

05:47.242 --> 05:49.228
And Robert is doing everything
he can to upgrade the

05:49.235 --> 05:52.228
environmental systems to
keep the air breathable.

05:52.239 --> 05:54.229
But the mods to the workshop
are already taxing the

05:54.236 --> 05:56.250
electrical system.

05:56.258 --> 05:58.281
We'd be lucky if it
supports us for 8 months,

05:58.288 --> 06:02.276
assuming Amelie can keep
this crew from falling apart.

06:05.286 --> 06:09.200
Where is the cover?

06:09.250 --> 06:11.227
But, this...

06:11.235 --> 06:13.254
why, why?

06:13.262 --> 06:18.265
It's all covered in dust.

06:21.241 --> 06:25.213
Let's see if it's
something from here.

06:26.268 --> 06:30.161
Javier, todo bien?

06:33.194 --> 06:36.199
Javier?

06:36.210 --> 06:40.223
esta bien,
esta bien, esta muy bien.

06:43.247 --> 06:45.200
Robert...

06:48.188 --> 06:50.207
if you open a cover, close it.

06:50.215 --> 06:53.129
If you open a box, close it.

06:53.140 --> 06:55.218
Patience, patience.

07:02.136 --> 07:04.192
You don't just cannibalize
my equipment when you need to

07:04.199 --> 07:07.167
jury-rig a goddamn
junction box.

07:07.178 --> 07:09.172
I needed
the fan to cool the upgrades,

07:09.179 --> 07:11.136
it was the only option.

07:11.143 --> 07:12.167
You have redundancies.

07:12.171 --> 07:13.190
That's not the point.

07:13.193 --> 07:16.111
If I don't fix this now,

07:16.122 --> 07:18.120
we are going to have problems
with the upgrades later on.

07:18.127 --> 07:21.154
Robert.

07:21.169 --> 07:26.081
Come help me with
the recycling system.

07:26.100 --> 07:29.159
Now!

07:34.155 --> 07:37.073
This
system is built for 2 people.

07:37.087 --> 07:40.076
If you want to keep
breathing I need the hardware.

07:45.112 --> 07:47.131
Why don't
we take a little break.

07:47.139 --> 07:50.099
Amelie, I can't.

07:50.110 --> 07:54.072
Close your eyes.

07:54.086 --> 07:58.033
Close your eyes!

07:59.046 --> 08:01.065
Tell me when you have it.

08:01.072 --> 08:05.035
Please.

08:05.050 --> 08:06.115
Nothing comes.

08:06.119 --> 08:09.041
Okay, breathe with me.

08:28.087 --> 08:33.061
It's raining.

08:33.078 --> 08:37.005
The drops are
hitting a tin roof.

08:37.019 --> 08:41.032
It's just a wash
of sound above me.

08:41.046 --> 08:46.037
And
what does it smell like?

08:56.977 --> 08:58.995
Lavender.

08:59.002 --> 09:02.940
Lavender.

09:03.005 --> 09:08.009
Now open your eyes.

09:19.967 --> 09:21.949
Thank you.

09:21.956 --> 09:27.971
You're
welcome, now go back to work.

09:40.970 --> 09:44.942
Lavender.

09:45.959 --> 09:48.944
Even in those
rare moments of quiet,

09:48.954 --> 09:51.955
we could feel the storm
was always looming.

09:51.965 --> 09:54.904
We knew if we didn't find a
home with the resources to

09:54.915 --> 09:59.877
sustain us, Mars would kill
us in any of a thousand ways.

10:06.865 --> 10:10.840
Mars itself is your enemy.

10:10.854 --> 10:12.902
You have a shared common
enemy on Mars trying to

10:12.910 --> 10:15.895
kill you every day.

10:16.842 --> 10:17.882
Mars.

10:17.884 --> 10:19.916
Photographs reveal a
cratered landscape,

10:19.924 --> 10:23.821
much like the moon and
apparently hostile to life.

10:23.839 --> 10:24.901
It's actually
the lack of resources that we

10:24.905 --> 10:26.895
have to worry about on Mars.

10:26.902 --> 10:30.803
We still have to figure out
how to create them there.

10:30.817 --> 10:32.852
When we get
to Mars we need to solve our

10:32.858 --> 10:35.814
basic needs and the basic
needs are going to be food,

10:35.825 --> 10:38.810
water, shelter and a
particular protection

10:38.821 --> 10:39.895
from radiation.

10:39.899 --> 10:42.788
The longer
you spend on the surface,

10:42.799 --> 10:45.820
the more dangerous it is so
you have to get underground

10:45.831 --> 10:48.795
and get away from radiation.

10:48.806 --> 10:49.855
There are a number
of strategies that can

10:49.863 --> 10:51.828
be employed.

10:51.835 --> 10:53.842
One of them could
be the lava tube.

10:53.849 --> 10:57.807
Rising from the
flame, giant volcanoes.

10:57.821 --> 11:01.759
Volcanoes have
existed on Mars for hundreds

11:01.774 --> 11:06.745
of millions of years,
and as they died away,

11:06.763 --> 11:10.809
the tubes that carry
the lava solidify and become

11:10.823 --> 11:14.824
huge long rooms.

11:15.833 --> 11:21.720
We can inflate a habitat
within a lava tube,

11:21.741 --> 11:24.800
but you have to be near them
so knowing where we are on

11:24.811 --> 11:27.771
Mars and what the
features are that we can use

11:27.781 --> 11:31.786
are extremely important.

11:31.801 --> 11:34.778
You'll have to be
looking for water also.

11:34.788 --> 11:38.710
Now Mars has some
trapped water resources.

11:38.724 --> 11:39.806
Everything
we've learned about life

11:39.809 --> 11:41.774
as we know
it requires liquid water.

11:41.781 --> 11:43.729
Full stop.

11:43.737 --> 11:46.726
So that's why the mantra for
Mars exploration has been

11:46.741 --> 11:49.726
thus far follow the water.

11:49.737 --> 11:51.784
There's the possibility
that there could be ice within

11:51.791 --> 11:53.764
lava tubes and we're
looking to see, you know,

11:53.772 --> 11:56.707
what the feasibility
of that is.

11:56.718 --> 11:58.721
We're still in the process
of figuring out where those

11:58.727 --> 12:01.729
lava tubes are and mapping
them is not a trivial thing.

12:01.740 --> 12:05.686
They're not so easy to find
because they're underground.

12:05.699 --> 12:07.756
So there's
no shortage of hard,

12:07.764 --> 12:10.670
technical challenges that
need to be addressed before

12:10.680 --> 12:13.698
we can have a sustained human
presence on Mars.

12:13.709 --> 12:15.740
It's really important that
we figure out how to get

12:15.747 --> 12:18.661
some of the basics.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.730
We'll use
a set of drones to find a

12:22.737 --> 12:25.672
lava tube with the conditions
we need to deploy a

12:25.683 --> 12:26.728
small domed habitat.

12:26.732 --> 12:28.684
And that
little foothold will become

12:28.691 --> 12:31.700
humankind's first real home
beyond the gravity well.

12:31.712 --> 12:35.650
Olympus town.

12:41.664 --> 12:43.707
Charged and ready.

12:43.714 --> 12:47.682
Unmanned aerial vehicles.

12:49.668 --> 12:51.641
We watched as
our drones took off into the

12:51.648 --> 12:57.613
alien sky, knowing they were
the only hope of finding the

12:57.635 --> 13:00.587
shelter and the resources
we'd need to deploy the dome

13:00.598 --> 13:05.585
and complete our mission.

13:06.614 --> 13:09.623
But if we couldn't find enough
ice to supply settlement,

13:09.634 --> 13:12.644
we'd be stranded

13:12.655 --> 13:15.598
and the Mars
mission would end.

13:21.052 --> 13:24.086
There's
much to learn about Mars.

13:24.103 --> 13:28.104
I mean, we're still as of
this week finding things out.

13:28.126 --> 13:31.040
We've sent orbiters,
we've sent rovers,

13:31.056 --> 13:33.071
we've sent things there
to explore it to get to

13:33.086 --> 13:35.054
know more about it.

13:35.065 --> 13:37.097
We have the interest and are
on the edge of the robotic

13:37.108 --> 13:42.029
technology that would allow us
to get there and do that work.

13:42.057 --> 13:44.051
So we're in
the process of right now what

13:44.062 --> 13:46.090
we call precursor missions,
robotic missions that go

13:46.100 --> 13:48.135
before the humans go
so we can characterize what

13:48.146 --> 13:53.033
the resource is, where
we would send humans.

13:53.061 --> 13:54.131
Something
that people might find a bit

13:54.137 --> 13:56.127
surprising is that
with modern orbiters,

13:56.138 --> 14:01.062
we've covered only
about 3% of the surface.

14:01.089 --> 14:05.061
We just don't have the data
volume coming back from Mars

14:05.082 --> 14:09.070
to get anywhere close to
mapping the whole surface.

14:09.094 --> 14:12.062
If we want to have humans
landing on the surface of

14:12.078 --> 14:14.092
Mars, we want to make sure
that the place where they're

14:14.103 --> 14:18.121
going is safe, and you can't
do that with 100 meter-per

14:18.143 --> 14:21.099
pixel resolution images.

14:21.115 --> 14:24.050
That tells you diddly squat.

14:24.067 --> 14:27.069
We have to prove that the
resources are there and so we

14:27.085 --> 14:30.102
like to think that ExoMars is
the next step to building up

14:30.118 --> 14:34.098
the knowledge for that
future manned mission.

14:38.081 --> 14:41.094
ExoMars comprises
2 major elements.

14:41.111 --> 14:43.155
The first element is
the trace gas orbiter,

14:43.166 --> 14:48.058
which will launch in 2016.

14:48.122 --> 14:53.080
I've been mostly involved
with the main imaging system.

14:53.109 --> 14:56.110
We like to talk about it being
the best color cameras that's

14:56.125 --> 14:58.123
ever been sent to Mars.

14:58.136 --> 15:00.139
We have stereo capability.

15:00.149 --> 15:04.129
That means that we can
construct a 3D-view of what

15:04.151 --> 15:09.063
the martian
surface looks like.

15:09.156 --> 15:14.073
I used to think of it almost
as a sort of a dead world.

15:14.100 --> 15:17.081
As you start to get more
and more immersed, I mean,

15:17.098 --> 15:20.161
you see fantastic phenomenon
on the surface of Mars.

15:21.115 --> 15:25.083
It just grabs you: polar caps,
looking at these new impact

15:25.105 --> 15:28.119
craters, the dune fields and
you're seeing them moving

15:28.136 --> 15:32.116
across the surface, dust
devils running around the place,

15:32.138 --> 15:36.084
and that to me,
it's brought the place to life.

15:36.106 --> 15:39.174
I get a real kick out of
looking at data from an object

15:39.191 --> 15:42.172
or from a surface or
from something that no

15:42.188 --> 15:46.097
one's ever seen before.

15:46.119 --> 15:49.086
ExoMars is
important because there are

15:49.103 --> 15:51.185
goals of the scientific
community that we want to

15:51.196 --> 15:56.088
advance before
humans get there.

16:05.130 --> 16:07.149
Seung, Hana.

16:07.161 --> 16:10.174
Mission Entry Phase 1.

16:10.191 --> 16:13.168
The crew is losing faith.

16:13.184 --> 16:16.177
Morale is slipping.

16:16.194 --> 16:20.124
We're doing everything
we can to find a way to make

16:20.146 --> 16:22.198
this workshop habitable until
we can find the place

16:22.209 --> 16:26.171
in those lava tubes.

16:32.151 --> 16:34.174
We were supposed to have two
years to find a lava tube with

16:34.185 --> 16:39.180
enough ice to supply the water
necessary to survive on Mars.

16:39.208 --> 16:42.143
But without the infrastructure
of Daedalus to sustain us

16:42.159 --> 16:47.176
while we searched, we'd be
lucky if we had a few months.

16:53.132 --> 16:54.197
Anything?

16:54.207 --> 16:58.116
Hmm, either the
candidate skylights don't have

16:58.137 --> 16:59.219
the horizontal
entrances we would need

16:59.225 --> 17:01.140
to bring in equipment,

17:01.151 --> 17:03.174
or the tubes the
skylights connect to don't

17:03.185 --> 17:06.119
have the subsurface
topography and ice access

17:06.137 --> 17:08.126
a settlement would need.

17:08.137 --> 17:09.220
Keep looking.

17:09.224 --> 17:16.152
Ugh, if
I push these modifications any

17:16.191 --> 17:21.118
further we risk overloading
the entire electrical system.

17:21.146 --> 17:23.137
Every piece of hardware
we've got is running

17:23.147 --> 17:24.210
into this junction box.

17:24.214 --> 17:27.137
It's too much.

17:27.154 --> 17:29.186
We don't
have a choice Robert.

17:39.155 --> 17:45.187
d d

17:54.187 --> 17:56.177
We have one
shot to deploy that dome.

17:56.188 --> 18:00.184
It doesn't go back in the box.

18:00.205 --> 18:02.157
There's
a pilot in charge of a

18:02.169 --> 18:05.187
multi-billion-dollar mission.

18:05.204 --> 18:08.189
If the conditions for
settlement are not there,

18:08.205 --> 18:10.215
we need to use our
second ship, Vega,

18:10.226 --> 18:15.197
as a life raft and
forget about Phase 2.

18:15.225 --> 18:17.236
If they deploy on
the surface, every nation from

18:17.247 --> 18:19.254
the International Mars
Science Foundation will vote

18:19.264 --> 18:21.221
to pull the plug on Mars.

18:21.232 --> 18:23.221
was already short,

18:23.232 --> 18:26.246
we cannot tolerate
any more failure.

18:26.263 --> 18:29.198
IMSF is sending
a deputy to Mission Control to

18:29.214 --> 18:31.200
assess whether
they're going to proceed or

18:31.211 --> 18:33.184
cancel this whole thing.

18:33.195 --> 18:38.207
You need to come to
sit before the board.

18:38.260 --> 18:40.204
We've got an
international hero dead and

18:40.214 --> 18:42.250
five more stuck in a utility
shack meant for two trying to

18:42.262 --> 18:45.243
find a needle in a haystack
before their systems fail.

18:45.259 --> 18:48.194
We don't like
the optics on this, Ed.

18:48.210 --> 18:50.208
Ophelia was doing just fine
in the satellite business

18:50.219 --> 18:52.233
before we bought
into your MMC initiative.

18:52.245 --> 18:54.243
If the most
qualified astronauts on the

18:54.254 --> 18:56.269
planet can't make it work,
how do you expect to make money

18:56.280 --> 18:59.232
selling tickets to people
following in their footsteps?

18:59.248 --> 19:01.259
IMSF is
already watching every move we

19:01.270 --> 19:04.201
make, waiting for an excuse
to end this whole thing.

19:04.218 --> 19:05.266
We need
to cut bait before they

19:05.271 --> 19:09.214
leave us holding the bag.

19:12.216 --> 19:15.201
Are you done?

19:20.270 --> 19:24.258
I made billions of dollars
in private enterprise

19:24.280 --> 19:27.198
and then I did it again

19:27.214 --> 19:29.246
and again.

19:29.257 --> 19:32.200
Every small town car
dealer knows about profits,

19:32.217 --> 19:35.184
bottom lines, and
cutting losses.

19:35.201 --> 19:39.206
And they all know about fear.

19:39.227 --> 19:42.208
You know what they
don't know about?

19:42.225 --> 19:45.247
Foresight.

19:45.264 --> 19:49.261
And faith.

19:50.262 --> 19:53.276
These are my tax reports
for the last five years.

19:53.293 --> 19:57.276
It shows my income,
investments and all my

19:57.298 --> 20:01.215
accounts, business and
personal, onshore, offshore,

20:01.236 --> 20:04.254
all around the world.

20:04.272 --> 20:10.188
You look at it and you'll
find that I've invested 90%

20:10.221 --> 20:15.228
of my own net
worth in this mission.

20:15.256 --> 20:18.295
I've got faith.

20:18.312 --> 20:23.269
And I'm asking for a
little bit more of yours.

20:23.297 --> 20:28.289
Slow down IMSF, and let this
crew carry out the mission

20:28.316 --> 20:34.194
we sent them there to do.

20:34.251 --> 20:37.215
If they fail,
I don't care how much you

20:37.233 --> 20:40.221
invested, we're out.

20:40.237 --> 20:45.241
If they fail,
everyone's out.

20:53.293 --> 20:56.311
We were at a
critical stage and all I could

20:56.328 --> 20:59.301
do was pretend I wasn't
just as worried as the

20:59.317 --> 21:02.280
rest of them.

21:02.297 --> 21:04.275
We haven't
been able to make the system

21:04.285 --> 21:06.304
run more efficiently.

21:06.316 --> 21:09.309
MAE,
report CO2 scrubber status.

21:09.325 --> 21:13.255
CO2 scrubbing has
declined an additional 3%

21:13.277 --> 21:15.308
since your last inquiry.

21:15.319 --> 21:20.256
There
are just too many of us.

21:20.284 --> 21:22.295
If we can't
make the workshop safe for

21:22.306 --> 21:24.292
long-term habitation,
we're going to need to start

21:24.303 --> 21:26.310
considering deploying
the dome on the surface.

21:26.320 --> 21:28.256
Then the
next ship that comes will be

21:28.267 --> 21:31.280
a rescue mission.

21:31.296 --> 21:33.240
We've got eight months.

it recorded on tape
tiny bits of information

to transmit back to Earth.

24:20.727 --> 24:24.665
The track

Mars seems

several spacecraft, I've
been involved in two missions

24:39.710 --> 24:43.722
where we've had failures,
Mars Polar Lander was one.

24:43.749 --> 24:45.743
There is more
news from NASA tonight and

24:45.756 --> 24:49.649
like almost all the news from
the space agency this year,

24:49.675 --> 24:50.699
it's not good.

24:56.690 --> 24:59.737
to yourself ah,
this ain't gonna happen.

24:59.760 --> 25:01.750
I'm sorry

in there with us.

25:10.746 --> 25:13.706
Mars is still
the death planet,

25:13.727 --> 25:17.728
it's a graveyard of
many, many spacecraft.

25:17.754 --> 25:22.774
Mars is hard to do.

25:27.798 --> 25:29.771
what do you
think your biggest challenge

25:29.784 --> 25:32.789
will be on this mission?

25:32.809 --> 25:37.721
Well, the biggest
challenge would be finding

25:37.754 --> 25:42.775
those lava tubes, but the
unknown to me is a bigger

25:42.808 --> 25:45.776
challenge than that.

25:45.795 --> 25:49.745
It's a vicious planet.

25:50.773 --> 25:51.822
The fire left them

25:51.829 --> 25:53.794
with less than a week of oxygen.

25:53.808 --> 25:55.786
IMSF sent me
to make a decision.

25:55.798 --> 25:57.788
Is Vega now a rescue mission?

25:57.801 --> 25:59.804
Because if the crew no longer
has the means to find a

25:59.817 --> 26:01.856
location in the lava tubes,
they're going to have to

26:01.869 --> 26:04.783
deploy the dome
on the surface.

26:04.803 --> 26:06.806
They're working
on sealing off the lab now,

26:06.819 --> 26:09.800
but we're still waiting to
hear about structural damage.

26:09.818 --> 26:10.859
What about the drones?

26:10.866 --> 26:13.788
Damage to the remote
system was catastrophic.

26:13.808 --> 26:14.869
No way they fly
again without additional

26:14.876 --> 26:16.816
supplies from Earth.

26:16.828 --> 26:18.818
Okay, guys,
go back to your stations and

26:18.831 --> 26:22.807
check it all again.

26:30.916 --> 26:32.844
I'd like
to speak to you about

26:32.858 --> 26:34.886

26:47.921 --> 26:52.883
If they deploy the dome
on the surface, we fail.

26:52.916 --> 26:55.872
IMSF will dissolve,
MMC will go bankrupt,

26:55.891 --> 26:57.931
and Earth will forget about
Mars just like they forgot

26:57.945 --> 27:01.871
about the moon.

If we can't find a site,
the Mars mission is dead.

27:11.953 --> 27:16.866

27:36.990 --> 27:38.997

29:01.078 --> 29:02.131
We're seeing no
options for sub-surface

29:02.142 --> 29:04.131
habitation with gamma
rays or neutron specs.

29:04.144 --> 29:07.047
They were supposed to have
two years to find a location

29:07.066 --> 29:08.127
with the right conditions.

29:08.134 --> 29:10.107

six drones in the air

29:10.125 --> 29:12.065
twelve hours a day.

29:12.078 --> 29:13.140
There's not a single
tube that shows any sign

29:13.147 --> 29:16.053
of a horizontal entrance.

29:16.072 --> 29:17.109
They have to deploy.

29:17.115 --> 29:18.151
Wait!

29:18.158 --> 29:22.109
I think I have something.

29:24.129 --> 29:26.136
We ignored this horizontal
entrance because it was

29:26.149 --> 29:29.092
clogged with breakdown debris
and too far from the nearest

29:29.111 --> 29:31.171
candidate skylight to be
part of the same tube system.

29:31.185 --> 29:36.089
But if we look at
the GPR scans here

29:36.121 --> 29:38.149
you can see that entrance
leads to a tectonic cave that

29:38.162 --> 29:43.095
passes right beside the
lava tube under this skylight.

29:43.128 --> 29:45.196
With the right equipment
on the next ship,

29:45.209 --> 29:47.182
we can clear the horizontal
entrance and combine

29:47.196 --> 29:49.136
the two cave systems.

29:49.150 --> 29:50.203
They'd have to lower
the dome in vertically,

29:50.210 --> 29:51.213
through the skylight.

29:52.125 --> 29:53.203
That tube is at
least two-hundred meters,

29:53.211 --> 29:55.214
rim to floor; the winch
on the crane only has

29:55.226 --> 29:57.149
fifty of cable.

29:57.162 --> 30:00.135
What about the
guidelines for the Daedalus?

30:00.154 --> 30:03.159
They've got three 35 meter
spools of cable with a

30:03.179 --> 30:04.232
nearly identical gauge.

30:04.239 --> 30:10.180
They splice those together,
that's 215 meters.

30:10.219 --> 30:12.155
If the
topography is right,

30:12.167 --> 30:18.144
and the ice is there,
we can justify deployment.

30:19.194 --> 30:22.241
Do it.

30:24.185 --> 30:26.195
Daedalus
crew, great news.

30:26.208 --> 30:28.252
We may have found a
place for deployment.

30:28.267 --> 30:32.209
Stand by for transmission
of coordinates.

30:34.188 --> 30:37.227
Kamen, Marta.
Mission Entry Phase 1.

30:39.216 --> 30:43.174
The idea that one of the lava
tubes we deemed unsuitable

30:43.201 --> 30:47.273
could be connected to a
tectonic cave is brilliant.

30:47.299 --> 30:51.229
Thanks, Joon, Mission Control.

30:51.255 --> 30:55.222
Spasibo.

31:05.234 --> 31:08.255
Hey Marta,
I hope you're not scared

31:08.276 --> 31:10.266
of the dark.

31:10.279 --> 31:15.229
Javier,
how are the cables?

31:15.262 --> 31:20.278
Good.

31:21.278 --> 31:24.280
Alright,
Marta, hang in there.

31:24.300 --> 31:27.302
Okay.

Javier, how are
the cables holding?

32:18.343 --> 32:19.384
Strong.

32:19.389 --> 32:24.326
I hope we have enough

32:32.380 --> 32:37.387
Talk to
us Marta, what do you see?

32:40.442 --> 32:46.408

33:42.504 --> 33:46.512
Nothing,

34:16.327 --> 34:18.371
Hello, and
welcome to Baikonur Cosmodrome

34:18.376 --> 34:20.208
in Kazakhstan.

34:20.306 --> 34:22.313
Counting down to the
launch of ExoMars,

34:22.315 --> 34:26.272
the world's biggest ever
mission to the red planet.

34:26.273 --> 34:27.338
Baikonur
is the largest launch

34:27.339 --> 34:29.261
facility in the world.

34:29.262 --> 34:32.259
It's where the Russians have
been launching missions from

34:32.260 --> 34:35.281
for the past 60 years,
all of the big missions have

34:35.282 --> 34:38.117
gone from there,
the Sputniks,

34:38.216 --> 34:41.234
the Vostoks, the Soyuz.

34:41.235 --> 34:45.188
It's the place where Gagarin
went up and did his launch.

34:52.204 --> 34:58.123
It's sort of a holy place
I think for space scientists.

34:58.124 --> 35:01.083
The ExoMars program is a
collaboration between the

35:01.084 --> 35:04.076
European Space
Agency and RosCosmos,

35:04.077 --> 35:06.125
and so there are
principal investigators,

35:06.126 --> 35:10.098
both from Europe and
from the Russian side.

35:11.026 --> 35:13.015
Maybe it's
a false impression that Mars

35:13.016 --> 35:16.075
is studied in every detail,
but it is actually not mapped

35:16.079 --> 35:18.996
in every detail completely.

35:18.997 --> 35:23.040
Far from that.

35:23.989 --> 35:26.027
I've been
thinking about ExoMars for

35:26.028 --> 35:29.979
more than 16 years.

35:30.969 --> 35:36.922
So, so that's it
over there, right?

35:40.887 --> 35:44.895
Now it's serious guys.

35:47.851 --> 35:49.873
What we're doing is
really rather difficult.

35:49.874 --> 35:54.811
A lot of things
have to go right.

35:54.837 --> 35:55.794
One minute.

35:55.893 --> 35:58.874
One minute.

36:00.773 --> 36:02.705
Building the instruments is
hard and maybe if you haven't

36:02.804 --> 36:04.789
done enough test time and
you're thinking to yourself,

36:04.790 --> 36:06.668
oh my goodness, you know,
this is going to go in

36:06.767 --> 36:09.763
another one
of these damn rockets.

36:09.764 --> 36:12.802
Launches are
inherently dangerous.

36:12.803 --> 36:17.744
There's always some sort of a
risk of something blowing up.

36:17.745 --> 36:19.759
As long as the thing
doesn't blow up when I'm

36:19.760 --> 36:22.677
too close to it.

36:22.678 --> 36:23.631
And we have liftoff.

36:23.732 --> 36:25.614
The
Americans have had failures,

36:25.713 --> 36:27.731
the Europeans
have had failures,

36:27.732 --> 36:29.671
the Russians have
had failures.

36:29.672 --> 36:32.656
We check things, we recheck
them. We have checkers checking

36:32.657 --> 36:36.673
the checkers, and how
much is enough to ensure

36:36.674 --> 36:39.601
that you don't fail?

36:56.510 --> 36:59.540
There she goes.

37:01.540 --> 37:05.478
Geez, look at that!

37:05.540 --> 37:09.487
Beautiful.

37:25.401 --> 37:28.339
That's
an experience, isn't it?

37:28.340 --> 37:30.400
Holy smokes!

37:39.274 --> 37:42.183
We have to
wait a little bit while things

37:42.282 --> 37:48.231
deploy and then we're
on our way to Mars.

37:48.232 --> 37:52.278
It gets you sort
of right there.

38:04.159 --> 38:06.222
You have this
incredible number of people

38:06.223 --> 38:09.182
all working to send
something to a strange kind

38:09.183 --> 38:13.151
of pinkish dot in the sky.

38:16.152 --> 38:22.138
I really like not seeing Mars
as a challenge to overcome,

38:22.139 --> 38:26.122
but Mars as an opportunity
to unite people together in

38:26.123 --> 38:32.014
a peaceful way and
give our species a goal.

38:32.100 --> 38:38.045
You're giving people something
optimistic to pursue.

38:46.999 --> 38:49.988
We've detected
glaciers of ice on Mars from

38:49.989 --> 38:52.841
orbit that are 40 meters
thick extending down to

38:52.940 --> 38:55.932
a latitude of 38 degrees.

38:55.933 --> 39:01.852
There is a huge amount
of sub-surface ice there

39:01.854 --> 39:05.880
so this is a unique
opportunity for us.

39:09.826 --> 39:14.796
