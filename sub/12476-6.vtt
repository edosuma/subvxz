16:19.679 --> 16:21.512
We just used the last bag.
I looked.

16:21.514 --> 16:22.947
You're sure?
Yes.

16:22.949 --> 16:24.515
Okay, breathe.

16:24.517 --> 16:26.951
Slowly, slowly.

16:26.953 --> 16:28.486
(monitor beeping)
Her SAT's are dropping.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.188
Theresa-- you're name's
Theresa, right?

16:30.190 --> 16:31.489
Look at me.
My name's Theo.

16:31.491 --> 16:32.957
I need you to look
at me right now.

16:32.959 --> 16:34.625
You have a collapsed
lung and that's why

16:34.627 --> 16:36.127
you're having trouble breathing.
OSCAR: Dr. Yedlin?

16:36.129 --> 16:37.628
Now, I'm gonna
get you through this.

16:37.630 --> 16:39.163
I'm not gonna leave you, okay?
Dr. Yedlin?

16:39.165 --> 16:40.965
You got it.
I need your help!

16:40.967 --> 16:42.500
Slow, breathe in.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.869
And out.... in, out.

16:44.871 --> 16:46.037
Good.
I'm not leaving you.

16:46.039 --> 16:47.705
Very good.

16:47.707 --> 16:49.507
I have to insert
this in your chest.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.042
It's gonna hurt, but it's
gonna let you breathe.

16:51.044 --> 16:52.143
Are you ready?

16:52.145 --> 16:53.544
(gasping)

17:02.822 --> 17:04.322
JASON: Dr. Yedlin?
That's better.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.157
JASON: Dr. Yedlin!
Okay.

17:06.159 --> 17:08.192
Why aren't the first generation
patients being prioritized?

17:08.194 --> 17:09.894
They are if they're dying.

17:09.896 --> 17:11.996
(man screaming)

17:11.998 --> 17:15.366
The femoral artery--
I-I can't find it!

17:15.368 --> 17:16.401
Clamp it off!

17:16.403 --> 17:17.735
I'm trying,
there's just...

17:17.737 --> 17:19.003
There's too much blood!

17:19.005 --> 17:20.571
Dr. Yedlin,
I need you to do this.

17:20.573 --> 17:22.673
I can't-- my hand is
in a patient right now.

17:22.675 --> 17:23.908
You can do it.
Okay.

17:23.910 --> 17:25.743
Put pressure on the thigh,

17:25.745 --> 17:27.378
and have your fingers
find the artery.

17:27.380 --> 17:28.846
Dig your fingers in there!

17:28.848 --> 17:31.182
(screaming)

17:31.184 --> 17:33.084
Okay, I think I found it!

17:33.086 --> 17:35.019
Bring the clamp in.

17:35.021 --> 17:37.455
Don't take your fingers off
until it's fully clamped.

17:42.529 --> 17:44.595
I got it.

17:44.597 --> 17:47.098
His heart rate's
coming down.

17:50.336 --> 17:52.737
(monitor beeping, echoing)

17:54.340 --> 17:56.407
(beeping fades away)

18:11.057 --> 18:13.491
♪ ♪

18:25.638 --> 18:27.371
(sighs)

18:29.943 --> 18:32.310
No one could've predicted
what happened tonight.

18:35.081 --> 18:38.449
I should've been
able to predict it.

18:38.451 --> 18:41.252
That the fields
would burn?

18:41.254 --> 18:44.755
How could you know that?

18:44.757 --> 18:46.390
It's an impossible situation.

18:50.630 --> 18:54.098
If I can't trust
my own instincts...

18:54.100 --> 18:56.501
rely on what Pilcher
taught me, what good am I?

18:59.606 --> 19:01.772
I should've had us
more prepared.

19:01.774 --> 19:04.175
You did prepare us.

19:04.177 --> 19:06.043
By planting them
in the first place.

19:08.648 --> 19:11.716
'Cause nothing would grow
in Wayward Pines.

19:14.120 --> 19:17.622
Why is that, Kerry?

19:17.624 --> 19:21.592
What's wrong
with the soil here?

19:21.594 --> 19:24.629
Why didn't Pilcher
account for it?

19:24.631 --> 19:27.098
What did we do to it?

19:28.635 --> 19:30.935
And what does it tell us
if we have to die

19:30.937 --> 19:33.538
to get the food
we need to survive?

19:40.346 --> 19:42.380
Who the hell are you?

19:43.483 --> 19:45.683
Because I thought
you were the man

19:45.685 --> 19:47.885
born to lead this town.

19:47.887 --> 19:50.788
Trained by Pilcher himself
to usher mankind

19:50.790 --> 19:52.957
Kerry... to the next
generation, but that is not

19:52.959 --> 19:55.159
who I see
in front of me right now.

19:55.161 --> 19:57.295
Because what I see...

19:57.297 --> 19:58.796
is weakness.

19:58.798 --> 20:01.199
And fear.

20:02.302 --> 20:05.236
Are you the man born to lead?

20:06.639 --> 20:09.140
Yes.

20:09.142 --> 20:11.842
Then act like it.

20:11.844 --> 20:15.379
And never let them
see you doubt it.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.448
Even if you do.

20:33.032 --> 20:34.432
Dr. Yedlin, hey.

20:34.434 --> 20:37.868
I was out there
with the firefighters.

20:37.870 --> 20:40.838
Uh...

20:40.840 --> 20:42.840
one of them got a piece of me.

20:42.842 --> 20:44.508
Huh.

20:44.510 --> 20:46.177
How's your jaw?

20:47.513 --> 20:49.513
Well, it hurts to smile.

20:49.515 --> 20:50.581
Was that the point?

20:51.517 --> 20:52.750
One of them.

20:54.587 --> 20:57.388
Hey, I left our wife
in your office.

20:57.390 --> 21:00.391
She actually saved
some lives, too, tonight.

21:00.393 --> 21:02.893
But... I'll let her
tell you all about it,

21:02.895 --> 21:05.029
since everything's
out in the open now.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.702
Oh, and Doc,
the first one's free,

21:11.704 --> 21:13.671
but the next one's
gonna cost you.

21:27.453 --> 21:30.388
You still have feelings for him?

21:32.058 --> 21:34.258
Our marriage was like all
the others in Wayward Pines.

21:34.260 --> 21:37.895
At first,
there were rules.

21:37.897 --> 21:39.897
There was surveillance.

21:39.899 --> 21:41.632
We were no more than cellmates.

21:44.470 --> 21:47.471
And I chose you
before any of this happened.

21:50.610 --> 21:53.044
Dr. Yedlin, we... we need you.

21:54.414 --> 21:56.681
THEO:
That's not an answer.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.189
(sighs)

22:08.995 --> 22:11.395
(breathing quickens)

22:13.766 --> 22:15.599
(footsteps approaching)

22:15.601 --> 22:18.002
(breathing hard)
Okay, uh, just...

22:18.004 --> 22:20.938
just try not
to move too much.

22:20.940 --> 22:22.306
Are you a doctor here?

22:22.308 --> 22:24.108
Chief resident, yes.

22:24.110 --> 22:26.610
Uh, Dr. Yedlin called on me
earlier tonight

22:26.612 --> 22:28.346
to perform
a femoral artery clamp.

22:28.348 --> 22:29.613
Theresa...

22:29.615 --> 22:31.115
Who?

22:31.117 --> 22:32.950
Theresa Burke.

22:32.952 --> 22:34.285
Is...

22:34.287 --> 22:36.787
Um, you should...
you should get some rest.

22:36.789 --> 22:39.190
Is she dead?

22:40.526 --> 22:42.326
I can't really discuss that.

22:42.328 --> 22:43.694
She...

22:45.465 --> 22:47.131
Just tell me.

22:47.133 --> 22:49.700
I mean that, uh,

22:49.702 --> 22:51.769
you have to be...
you have to be family.

23:03.082 --> 23:05.383
The Abbies were targeting
any man with a hose.

23:05.385 --> 23:07.318
Their goal, clearly,
was to stop us

23:07.320 --> 23:09.019
from saving the crops.

23:09.021 --> 23:10.388
You're saying the Abbies knew

23:10.390 --> 23:11.555
what the men were doing
and targeted them?

23:11.557 --> 23:12.556
MEGAN:
I'm sure it was very

23:12.558 --> 23:14.158
confusing out there, Mario,

23:14.160 --> 23:16.660
in the dark,
in the heat of the battle...

23:16.662 --> 23:18.229
I know what I saw, ma'am,

23:18.231 --> 23:20.331
as I watched my men die.

23:20.333 --> 23:21.365
How many troops do we have left?

23:21.367 --> 23:23.901
We lost half of the men, sir.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.736
We have less than
20 soldiers left.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.172
MEGAN:
Perhaps we should

23:28.174 --> 23:29.507
reconsider recruiting so heavily

23:29.509 --> 23:31.008
from the First Generation...

23:31.010 --> 23:32.676
We'll recruit more of them.

23:32.678 --> 23:35.212
It's an honor to serve
against a real enemy.

23:35.214 --> 23:37.515
Our real enemy already did
what they came to do:

23:37.517 --> 23:38.949
attack our food source.

23:38.951 --> 23:41.519
I'm sorry, you make it sound
as if the Abbies had a plan.

23:41.521 --> 23:43.854
They set fires at the corners,

23:43.856 --> 23:45.423
so that it would spread faster.

23:45.425 --> 23:48.259
The Abbies never used fire
as a weapon before.

23:48.261 --> 23:51.362
Not in all the years
we've been here.

23:51.364 --> 23:52.863
Until we used it against them

23:52.865 --> 23:54.098
to harvest the crops.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.466
We taught them.

23:56.369 --> 23:57.768
And tonight, they learned.

23:57.770 --> 24:00.371
Stop talking about them
as though they're human.

24:00.373 --> 24:03.207
When the fields were on fire,

24:03.209 --> 24:05.709
Margaret was calm, but the males

24:05.711 --> 24:08.712
in the lab became
highly aggressive,

24:08.714 --> 24:10.047
as if...

24:10.049 --> 24:11.382
as if they knew
what was happening.

24:11.384 --> 24:12.716
So if they did have a plan...

24:12.718 --> 24:14.285
They had no plan!

24:17.390 --> 24:19.457
The crops. Tell me.

24:19.459 --> 24:22.059
The flame took the plants
down to the root.

24:22.061 --> 24:24.261
The earth is scorched.

24:24.263 --> 24:26.564
Replanting on that ground
would take months,

24:26.566 --> 24:27.765
if the Abbies even let us.

24:27.767 --> 24:28.966
So we only have the food

24:28.968 --> 24:30.568
that's currently
in the storehouse.

24:30.570 --> 24:32.903
JASON: No. Plant something
that grows quickly.

24:32.905 --> 24:34.071
It won't work.

24:34.073 --> 24:36.240
What are you saying?

24:36.242 --> 24:38.409
That we'll starve to death?

24:38.411 --> 24:40.478
Every human on the planet
starves to death?

24:42.982 --> 24:44.148
In how long?

24:45.585 --> 24:47.318
If nothing changes...

24:50.990 --> 24:52.556
...less than six weeks.

24:58.531 --> 25:00.331
JASON:
Today, we mourn the loss

25:00.333 --> 25:03.167
of 35 members of this town.

25:04.170 --> 25:07.671
35 members of our species.

25:09.008 --> 25:11.041
It's easy.

25:11.043 --> 25:12.877
It's easy to wake up
in the morning

25:12.879 --> 25:15.779
and forget who we are.

25:15.781 --> 25:17.781
It's easy to forget
that there are no more

25:17.783 --> 25:21.218
second chances for humanity.

25:21.220 --> 25:24.054
That this is it.

25:24.056 --> 25:26.423
That we are it.

25:29.061 --> 25:31.462
I'm told that people
used to tell stories.

25:33.366 --> 25:35.466
Stories that mankind

25:35.468 --> 25:37.468
began with only two people,

25:37.470 --> 25:40.237
a man and a woman.

25:41.908 --> 25:45.543
Now we number 1,178.

25:45.545 --> 25:48.245
So today, I believe

25:48.247 --> 25:50.047
that if we rose from two,

25:50.049 --> 25:52.082
we can rise from this.

25:52.084 --> 25:54.718
We are the hope of mankind.

25:54.720 --> 25:57.488
We will survive.

25:57.490 --> 25:59.557
For those lost.

26:01.260 --> 26:03.327
And for the future.

26:05.164 --> 26:06.897
SOLDIER:
Present arms!

26:08.067 --> 26:10.334
Ready... aim...

26:10.336 --> 26:11.669
fire!

26:14.006 --> 26:15.573
Ready!
(rifles clicking)

26:15.575 --> 26:16.774
Aim!

26:16.776 --> 26:17.841
Fire!

26:17.843 --> 26:19.677

26:19.679 --> 26:20.911
Ready!

26:20.913 --> 26:22.179

26:22.181 --> 26:23.414
Aim!

26:23.416 --> 26:24.982
Fire!

26:29.855 --> 26:31.755
(cash register dings)

26:31.757 --> 26:33.257
Here you go.

26:33.259 --> 26:34.592
Thank you.

26:41.634 --> 26:42.933
XANDER:
Fellas.

26:42.935 --> 26:44.802
Wayward Vine?

26:44.804 --> 26:46.470
We're collecting the weapons

26:46.472 --> 26:48.439
that were commandeered
from the armory last night.

26:48.441 --> 26:50.441
Oh. MARIO: I need yours.

26:50.443 --> 26:52.309
Hmm.

26:52.311 --> 26:54.778
"Commandeered"?

26:54.780 --> 26:58.616
Nope. No, I'm afraid I don't
know what you're talking about.

27:00.286 --> 27:01.952
Oh, wait.

27:01.954 --> 27:03.821
You mean the ones that we used
to save your asses.

27:03.823 --> 27:05.122
You mean those weapons?

27:05.124 --> 27:06.624
Yeah.
'Cause I do have

27:06.626 --> 27:08.058
one of those.

27:12.798 --> 27:14.732
I won't discover that
you kept some for yourself?

27:14.734 --> 27:15.966
Nah.

27:15.968 --> 27:18.168
I mean, we got no food.

27:18.170 --> 27:20.638
Abbies just killed
a few dozen people.

27:20.640 --> 27:22.973
We can't have citizens
running around

27:22.975 --> 27:25.309
able to defend themselves,
can we?

27:25.311 --> 27:26.710
That's your job.

27:27.913 --> 27:29.380
You're doing great,
by the way.

27:32.852 --> 27:34.852
Toss the place if you want.

27:40.359 --> 27:41.759
You have a nice day.

27:43.429 --> 27:45.829
Those shirts--

27:45.831 --> 27:47.364
I always thought

27:47.366 --> 27:50.000
they were an odd choice
of color.

27:50.002 --> 27:51.402
Brown.

27:53.139 --> 27:54.138
Of course...

27:54.140 --> 27:56.707
I guess all you First Gens

27:56.709 --> 27:58.876
aren't exactly
up on your history.

27:58.878 --> 28:02.179
"Do not discuss the past"
and all that.

28:08.521 --> 28:10.621
I know history.

28:10.623 --> 28:11.955
I know your history.

28:11.957 --> 28:14.191
Crashed out
of the Marines.

28:14.193 --> 28:16.493
Drug dealer
given a second chance.

28:16.495 --> 28:18.395
Pilcher chose everyone
for a reason.

28:18.397 --> 28:19.797
Yours was

28:19.799 --> 28:21.899
"resourcefulness."

28:21.901 --> 28:23.200
Hmm.

28:23.202 --> 28:24.802
But instead of
using that skill

28:24.804 --> 28:26.970
to ensure the preservation
of our species,

28:26.972 --> 28:28.572
you used it to help yourself.

28:28.574 --> 28:32.209
How's business, Xander?

28:32.211 --> 28:34.712
You know where I can find any
pills, any extra rations?

28:35.648 --> 28:37.915
People are scared
about food,

28:37.917 --> 28:40.884
so I'm sure there's
a nice profit to be made.

28:40.886 --> 28:44.054
I know who you used to be.

28:44.056 --> 28:46.390
And history?

28:46.392 --> 28:48.726
I know it repeats itself.

28:54.767 --> 28:56.133
(door bell jingles)

28:56.769 --> 28:58.235
(door shuts)

29:03.776 --> 29:06.110
Dr. Yedlin.
How are the wounded?

29:06.112 --> 29:08.112
Five are still critical.

29:08.114 --> 29:09.747
Three we just
discharged today.

29:09.749 --> 29:11.749
You're about to have
a much bigger problem,

29:11.751 --> 29:13.450
and that's medication.

29:13.452 --> 29:18.522
Steroids, antibiotics--
they're all dangerously low.

29:18.524 --> 29:20.858
It seems like
your lord and savior, Pilcher,

29:20.860 --> 29:23.293
did not bring enough, nor
did he make any provisions

29:23.295 --> 29:25.929
to generate pharmaceuticals.
Now, I think

29:25.931 --> 29:28.432
I can probably synthesize
a very, very basic

29:28.434 --> 29:30.200
form of penicillin
in the lab, but--

29:30.202 --> 29:31.568
Pilcher thought
we would be

29:31.570 --> 29:34.271
treating things like
ear infection

29:34.273 --> 29:36.073
and strep throat.
He never anticipated

29:36.075 --> 29:38.275
that we would have
so many war injuries,

29:38.277 --> 29:40.310
or that we would go through
so much medication

29:40.312 --> 29:43.046
so fast.
What did he anticipate?

29:43.048 --> 29:44.948
How low are the supplies?

29:44.950 --> 29:47.885
It's not an exaggeration
to say that people could

29:47.887 --> 29:50.654
soon be dying
of a sinus infection.

29:50.656 --> 29:52.723
Tetanus, certainly.

29:52.725 --> 29:55.759
And if a major flu came, it
would have a devastating effect.

29:55.761 --> 29:57.594
The food crisis--
we need to find a way forward,

29:57.596 --> 29:59.396
a way of surviving
the shortages.

29:59.398 --> 30:01.298
With the Abbies in retreat
once again, we have...

30:01.300 --> 30:03.567
I'm afraid that's
no longer the case, sir.

30:03.569 --> 30:05.068
In the last two hours,
the Abbies have reentered

30:05.070 --> 30:07.337
the valley outside the fence.

30:08.941 --> 30:11.074
Roughly 100
now hold territory

30:11.076 --> 30:13.310
immediately outside
our borders.

30:13.312 --> 30:14.945
CJ:
See? They learned from us.

30:14.947 --> 30:17.748
They learned that the fields
were important,

30:17.750 --> 30:20.017
they learned how to use fire,
they faked retreat,

30:20.019 --> 30:22.986
ambushed us, and now
they cut off our escape.

30:22.988 --> 30:25.422
"Ambush." "Retreat."

30:25.424 --> 30:29.159
These are concepts
these things don't understand.

30:29.161 --> 30:31.762
This is distracting us from
the problems we already have.

30:31.764 --> 30:33.664
When are you gonna realize
that<i> this</i> is the problem?

30:33.666 --> 30:35.265
Then what, Dr. Yedlin?

30:35.267 --> 30:36.867
The Abbies should
inherit the Earth?

30:36.869 --> 30:38.802
You're here as a doctor,
not as a military advisor.

30:38.804 --> 30:41.271
You'd do well
to remember that.

30:42.474 --> 30:44.575
How are we gonna survive?

31:00.993 --> 31:03.060
(sighs)

31:09.368 --> 31:11.435
(door creaking)

31:24.550 --> 31:26.383
(monitor beeping)

31:44.770 --> 31:46.837
♪ ♪

32:02.021 --> 32:03.720
I was expecting
Pilcher.

32:03.722 --> 32:06.256
He's busy. He sent me.

32:06.258 --> 32:08.058
Don't worry, I walked,

32:08.060 --> 32:10.894
and I wasn't followed.

32:10.896 --> 32:12.763
Would you even know if you were?

32:13.699 --> 32:15.599
He said it was done.

32:15.601 --> 32:17.701
And it is.

32:17.703 --> 32:20.103
Ethan won't be a problem
for you or for us.

32:20.105 --> 32:22.039
He belongs to the future.

32:22.041 --> 32:23.440
And she's yours.

32:23.442 --> 32:26.476
You can have the life
you always wanted.

32:26.478 --> 32:30.580
I heard you wanted
to call it off. Why?

32:30.582 --> 32:31.882
I thought you loved her.

32:33.786 --> 32:36.053
That doesn't make it right.

32:48.734 --> 32:50.767
(door bell jangles)

32:50.769 --> 32:53.236
(indistinct conversations
in distance)

33:00.112 --> 33:01.845
WOMAN:
All right, nice to see you.

33:07.619 --> 33:09.853
(door bell jingles, door shuts)

33:09.855 --> 33:11.655
MAN:
Anything else, or is that it?

33:21.200 --> 33:23.333
XANDER:
Be careful.

33:23.335 --> 33:25.302
All right.

33:25.304 --> 33:26.603
Good luck.

33:26.605 --> 33:28.205
MAN:
Thank you.

33:33.445 --> 33:35.145
(door bell jangles)

33:35.147 --> 33:37.047
What is the matter with you?

33:38.717 --> 33:40.817
Uh, you're gonna have
to help me out, here.

33:40.819 --> 33:42.152
I saw you go into the alley.

33:42.154 --> 33:43.987
Jason's already
thrown you

33:43.989 --> 33:45.222
outside the fence once.

33:45.224 --> 33:46.490
Becca...

33:46.492 --> 33:47.724
The guns I understand,

33:47.726 --> 33:49.526
and I helped you with that.

33:49.528 --> 33:51.828
But if you kept some,
or you stole more pills...

33:51.830 --> 33:53.030
Apples.

33:53.032 --> 33:54.331
Excuse me?

33:54.333 --> 33:56.566
I gave him apples.

33:56.568 --> 33:58.535
Dale and his wife have got
three little kids

33:58.537 --> 34:01.004
and I figured they could use
the extra fruit from the shop

34:01.006 --> 34:02.305
more than I could.

34:04.576 --> 34:06.209
I'm keeping my head down.

34:06.211 --> 34:09.679
If the world's gonna end...

34:09.681 --> 34:11.982
I'm gonna go out strong.

34:20.592 --> 34:22.592
We weren't nothing...

34:22.594 --> 34:24.261
Becca.

34:26.198 --> 34:29.266
I know we had
our problems, but...

34:29.268 --> 34:31.068
there were good times, too.

34:31.070 --> 34:33.036
You know that.

34:33.038 --> 34:35.405
People can change.

34:36.942 --> 34:39.109
What they want and what
they need, it can change.

34:44.750 --> 34:46.917
They don't want us
to be human in here,

34:46.919 --> 34:50.520
but, uh... it happens.

34:56.895 --> 34:59.596
Maybe you can ask
your other husband

34:59.598 --> 35:01.298
if he knows what I mean.

35:06.305 --> 35:09.439
And maybe you can tell me
when I'm coming back home.

35:29.094 --> 35:30.193
(door bell jingles)

35:34.833 --> 35:36.900
(panting)

36:01.660 --> 36:03.727
(monitor beeping steadily)

36:08.300 --> 36:10.033
Theresa.

36:10.035 --> 36:11.368
I'm so sorry.

36:13.639 --> 36:16.139
You weren't supposed
to follow Ethan.

36:16.141 --> 36:18.708
I...

36:18.710 --> 36:21.178
I just wanted us
to be together.

36:26.118 --> 36:27.384
I'm so sorry that...

36:27.386 --> 36:30.720
that-that I couldn't
protect you.

36:30.722 --> 36:34.457
That I...
I couldn't save you.

36:37.196 --> 36:40.030
Or that I did save you.

36:40.032 --> 36:41.398
(cries quietly)

36:44.736 --> 36:46.069
It's okay.

36:48.173 --> 36:49.472
It's okay.

37:05.190 --> 37:06.623
(laughs)

37:08.860 --> 37:10.727
(echoing):
Happy birthday, sweetie.

37:13.165 --> 37:15.232
(flat line tone)

37:35.287 --> 37:38.321
(MRI whirring)

37:41.093 --> 37:43.159
(equipment whirrs quietly)

37:45.063 --> 37:46.763
Dr. Yedlin.

37:46.765 --> 37:49.299
(growls) I'm sorry we
started without you;

37:49.301 --> 37:50.667
I know you've been busy.

37:52.537 --> 37:54.771
It's horrible,
what happened

37:54.773 --> 37:56.806
outside the fence.
So many lives lost.

37:56.808 --> 37:58.642
Yeah. Well, we're
gonna starve to death.

37:58.644 --> 38:02.612
Well, that makes our work
that much more important.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.781
What's the progress?

38:04.783 --> 38:07.217
I am conducting
an MRI,

38:07.219 --> 38:09.919
as per the very thorough
research guidelines

38:09.921 --> 38:11.988
you sent over.

38:11.990 --> 38:13.657
With the crops gone

38:13.659 --> 38:15.725
and-and the Abbies
amassing outside,

38:15.727 --> 38:18.895
we have to understand
why this one is so docile,

38:18.897 --> 38:21.631
when the others
all want to kill us.

38:21.633 --> 38:22.966
Wouldn't you agree?

38:22.968 --> 38:25.001
Yes. That's why
I told you to do it.

38:25.003 --> 38:26.736
Margaret holds the key;
I firmly believe that.

38:26.738 --> 38:29.506
Still an animal...

38:29.508 --> 38:31.741
of course, but
there is something

38:31.743 --> 38:33.310
exquisite about her.

38:33.312 --> 38:37.681
Now, what precisely
are we looking for?

38:37.683 --> 38:40.150
I assume it's...
Temporal gyrus.

38:40.152 --> 38:42.752
Advanced thought
and problem-solving,

38:42.754 --> 38:44.287
center of language
for her brain.

38:44.289 --> 38:46.656
I still have trouble

38:46.658 --> 38:48.258
with the notion
that these creatures

38:48.260 --> 38:49.392
such as...
Huh.

38:50.829 --> 38:52.962
What is it?
The temporal gyrus

38:52.964 --> 38:55.865
for a chimp is about the third
the size of a human's.

39:01.340 --> 39:04.207
And hers appears to be
double the size of ours.

39:06.645 --> 39:09.212
Do you think
she can understand us?

39:22.194 --> 39:24.260
I, um...

39:26.198 --> 39:28.798
I have a, um, spare bedroom

39:28.800 --> 39:30.467
at my place.

39:33.205 --> 39:35.638
I mean...

39:37.209 --> 39:39.743
I...

39:39.745 --> 39:41.444
I wouldn't impose, I just...

39:42.681 --> 39:45.148
...thought maybe...

39:45.150 --> 39:47.484
(whispering):
I'd give you your privacy.

39:51.256 --> 39:53.390
Got any other pains
I should know about?

39:53.392 --> 39:55.892
We were never close.

39:58.563 --> 40:01.931
I want to ask you
something.

40:01.933 --> 40:04.567
You're the only one who has
seen them, how they live.

40:04.569 --> 40:06.002
How they move.

40:07.572 --> 40:10.306
Do they communicate
in any way that you've seen?

40:12.177 --> 40:13.743
I know they're
largely violent,

40:13.745 --> 40:16.246
but it seems that
they have a purpose.

40:18.417 --> 40:20.917
We've done some preliminary
tests with a female,

40:20.919 --> 40:23.620
and it seems to me...
Did you say female?

40:23.622 --> 40:25.955
How... how do you know
about the females?

40:25.957 --> 40:27.390
They have one.

40:27.392 --> 40:28.858
Up in the Mountain lab.

40:28.860 --> 40:32.128
There's a female Abby
in this town?

40:32.130 --> 40:34.964
Her palm-- does it have a mark?

40:34.966 --> 40:37.267
A raised mark,
it's like a brand?

40:37.269 --> 40:39.335
Tell me.

40:47.145 --> 40:49.212
(roaring, howling in distance)

41:03.128 --> 41:05.195
(roaring continues)

41:25.317 --> 41:27.984
(kids chattering)

41:27.986 --> 41:30.353
Can I take an apple?
Yeah, apples for dinner.

41:30.355 --> 41:32.422
(distant roaring, screeching)

41:42.968 --> 41:45.034
(growling, roaring, continuing)

42:00.619 --> 42:02.685
(roaring continuing)

42:31.149 --> 42:34.717
We're safe.
Right, Dr. Yedlin?
