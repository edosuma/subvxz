<i>Previously on
The Americans...</i>

00:01.899 --> 00:03.831
We got it wrong.

00:03.934 --> 00:05.774
Stobert isn't looking
to poison us or our food.

00:05.802 --> 00:08.436
He wants to develop a wheat
that can grow anywhere.

00:08.538 --> 00:10.682
GABRIEL: Think what getting our
hands on it could mean to us.

00:10.706 --> 00:12.407
No more shortages.

00:12.508 --> 00:14.409
No more buying grain
from the west.

00:14.510 --> 00:16.210
PHILIP: We've been giving
the Centre

00:16.312 --> 00:17.523
a lot of detailed reports
about Stan.

00:17.547 --> 00:20.781
They know he's a loner
that would go for her type.

00:20.917 --> 00:22.550
You think we sent her?

00:22.652 --> 00:25.052
I'm just saying...

00:25.154 --> 00:26.720
I'm sorry
you're spread so thin.

00:26.823 --> 00:30.290
This will all be easy.

00:30.392 --> 00:32.560
PHILIP:
How was your appointment?

00:32.662 --> 00:35.996
He's, uh, got file cabinets in
his office with basic locks.

00:36.098 --> 00:37.397
I'm going home.

00:37.499 --> 00:39.566
- Did something happen?
- No.

00:39.668 --> 00:40.968
It's just time.

00:41.070 --> 00:43.470
I spoke to Gabriel
about my father.

00:43.572 --> 00:46.974
He was a guard
at a prison camp.

00:47.076 --> 00:50.344
I don't know anything.

00:50.446 --> 00:53.680
My own parents, I don't know
anything about them at all.

00:59.521 --> 01:01.621
PHILIP:
You need a hand?

01:01.723 --> 01:03.155
No, it's all
under control.

01:11.999 --> 01:13.398
Help yourself.

01:18.606 --> 01:21.106
(clears throat)

01:21.208 --> 01:22.608
(pours tea)

01:22.710 --> 01:24.075
I can't tell you,
Paige,

01:24.177 --> 01:26.511
how much I've been
looking forward to this day.

01:26.646 --> 01:30.148
I have heard so much
about you for so long.

01:32.685 --> 01:35.020
Where did
you meet my parents?

01:35.122 --> 01:38.356
Here, in Washington,
a long time ago.

01:43.963 --> 01:47.899
Are you a-a spy?

01:48.001 --> 01:49.366
Yes.

01:51.704 --> 01:55.573
Gabriel works with us.

01:55.675 --> 01:57.307
He helps us.

01:59.011 --> 02:01.311
GABRIEL: I know it's been
a difficult time, Paige,

02:01.414 --> 02:05.315
finding out your parents had
withheld things from you.

02:05.418 --> 02:07.351
It's been hard.

02:07.453 --> 02:08.985
Well...

02:09.088 --> 02:12.189
To you they're
just your parents.

02:12.291 --> 02:15.458
They probably
drive you crazy.

02:15.561 --> 02:19.729
Because they have driven me
crazy from time to time.

02:21.900 --> 02:25.635
But to us,
they're honestly heroes.

02:27.005 --> 02:28.838
They've saved
a lot of lives.

02:31.709 --> 02:36.612
Marx says if we choose
to work for all mankind,

02:36.714 --> 02:39.215
no burdens
can bring us down

02:39.317 --> 02:43.252
because our sacrifices are then
for the benefit of all.

02:43.354 --> 02:47.623
And your parents have
sacrificed a lot for others.

02:47.725 --> 02:50.893
They've stood for something
larger than themselves,

02:50.995 --> 02:53.462
and that takes courage.

02:53.564 --> 02:57.566
And you've shown
a lot of courage, too.

02:57.668 --> 02:58.968
I haven't done anything.

02:59.070 --> 03:00.970
Yes, you have.

03:01.072 --> 03:05.240
Despite all the garbage
that you have had to deal with,

03:05.375 --> 03:09.344
you asked for the truth,
and you faced it.

03:09.446 --> 03:13.715
And I think
that's courage.

live there, does he?

03:29.165 --> 03:31.298
No.

03:31.400 --> 03:35.937
There weren't
any pictures anywhere.

03:36.039 --> 03:38.705
It's a place we can
all meet safely.

03:41.144 --> 03:43.076
He cares about you.

03:43.179 --> 03:46.480
He cares about
you, too.

03:46.582 --> 03:50.984
He knows, like,
everything about me.

03:51.086 --> 03:54.287
Yeah, yeah, we told him,
over the years.

03:54.389 --> 03:56.690
I remember the day
you started first grade.

03:56.792 --> 04:01.128
He said, "You need a pencil,
a notebook, and a brain.

04:01.229 --> 04:05.732
You buy her the first two.
She has plenty of the third."

04:05.834 --> 04:07.968
You remember
that stuffed tiger

04:08.070 --> 04:10.102
you used to hide
in your bookbag?

04:10.205 --> 04:11.804
Jesse?

04:11.939 --> 04:14.073
Gabriel got him
for you.

04:14.176 --> 04:17.009
He said he wanted you to grow up
strong like a tiger.

04:20.081 --> 04:21.981
He's like your family.

04:24.919 --> 04:27.953
Yeah, he is.

the lab worker went missing.

what I can get from Deirdre,

05:25.805 --> 05:30.674
you now, maybe places where
they ship the seed, store it.

05:30.776 --> 05:32.676
Okay,
I'll work Stobert, too.

05:40.052 --> 05:42.219
Paige liked Gabriel.

05:42.321 --> 05:44.921
Yeah, enough.

05:45.991 --> 05:47.724
I think it's
getting better with her.

05:47.860 --> 05:49.893
I think so, too.

05:49.995 --> 05:54.264
If we can just keep it going
and get her past this.

05:54.366 --> 05:56.332

17:38.537 --> 17:40.704
We're trying.

17:40.806 --> 17:42.706
- It takes time.
- Yeah.

17:42.808 --> 17:44.441
Do you have time?

17:44.543 --> 17:46.943
I mean,
how long before they--

17:47.045 --> 17:49.546
Oh, we don't--
We don't know exactly.

17:53.486 --> 17:55.986
I knew America did
terrible things,

17:56.088 --> 18:01.291
but I never thought--
I mean, people's <i> food.</i>

18:02.694 --> 18:05.996
I know it's hard
understanding these things,

18:06.098 --> 18:08.631
seeing these things.

18:08.733 --> 18:12.001
But the world--
it doesn't work the way

18:12.103 --> 18:15.505
a lot of people here
think that it does.

18:15.607 --> 18:19.609
Can't you just go to the press,
tell them what's going on?

18:19.711 --> 18:21.511
I mean, not--
not the spy part,

18:21.613 --> 18:23.846
but just about what they're
doing with the grain?

18:23.948 --> 18:24.980
We can't do that.

18:25.082 --> 18:26.849
Why not?
It worked with Watergate.

18:26.984 --> 18:30.820
Just let them
expose it to the world.

18:30.922 --> 18:32.521
They'd have to stop then.

18:32.623 --> 18:34.690
No one
would believe us.

18:38.362 --> 18:42.664
(sighs)
Yeah.

18:42.766 --> 18:44.066
How'd it go?

18:44.168 --> 18:47.769
(sighs) I got
a lot of paperwork, you know,

18:47.871 --> 18:52.441
budget spreadsheets, locations,
things we can match to.

18:52.543 --> 18:55.210
Stobert said
he's going to Mississippi

18:55.312 --> 18:57.011
for work Thursday.

18:59.316 --> 19:02.550
Yeah, I-I think Mississippi
was in there.

19:02.652 --> 19:03.852
How'd it go
at the shrink?

19:03.954 --> 19:05.854
I got it.

19:05.956 --> 19:07.155
Oh.

19:07.257 --> 19:08.522
Who was on the list?

19:08.624 --> 19:09.924
I don't know.

19:10.026 --> 19:12.693
Names and addresses
of people back home.

19:17.667 --> 19:22.837
We were talking about
next Saturday.

19:22.938 --> 19:26.039
Great.

19:26.141 --> 19:27.408
Yeah, she's been
bugging me

19:27.510 --> 19:28.709
to see
"Terms of Endearment."

19:28.811 --> 19:29.943
(scoffs)
I hear it's great.

19:30.045 --> 19:31.579
Oh.

19:34.083 --> 19:35.315
So...

19:38.620 --> 19:42.389
- You good?
- Yeah.

19:42.491 --> 19:46.927
No, really,
things have been better.

19:47.029 --> 19:49.329
Better how?

19:49.431 --> 19:51.431
I just realized, there are much
more important things

19:51.533 --> 19:53.633
in the world than me.

19:53.735 --> 19:57.904
It's a good thing
to realize

19:58.006 --> 19:59.606
that there are things
bigger than you.

19:59.708 --> 20:02.308
Most people never
figure that out.

20:02.411 --> 20:04.277
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

20:04.379 --> 20:07.413
Jesus spent his whole life
teaching us that.

20:07.515 --> 20:09.448
And realizing it
leads to empathy,

20:09.550 --> 20:11.517
but empathy leads us
to help others,

20:11.619 --> 20:13.485
to make sacrifices
in our own life

20:13.587 --> 20:15.487
for the benefit
of someone else.

20:16.824 --> 20:20.326
His crucifixion was
the ultimate example of that.

20:20.428 --> 20:23.396
Yeah.

20:23.497 --> 20:24.730
Of course,
you're important, too.

20:24.832 --> 20:26.565
I hope you know that.

20:26.667 --> 20:28.199
I do.

20:28.302 --> 20:30.068
You been praying?

20:35.175 --> 20:36.575
Sometimes.

20:48.521 --> 20:50.388
(clears throat)

20:54.894 --> 20:56.661
The Deputy AG asked me
to tell you some news

20:56.763 --> 20:59.163
he thought
you'd like to hear.

20:59.265 --> 21:02.366
CIA is backing off
Burov in Moscow.

21:07.474 --> 21:09.206
That's the good news.

21:09.308 --> 21:10.741
He also said
he wants you

21:10.844 --> 21:13.010
transferred out of
counterintelligence.

21:19.118 --> 21:23.954
I told him I can't do that
because of an active operation.

21:24.056 --> 21:26.923
I briefed him on what
you're running with Aderholt.

21:29.261 --> 21:30.861
How'd he take that?

21:30.963 --> 21:32.195
Not great.

21:32.297 --> 21:34.898
But I don't think
our TASS contact

21:35.000 --> 21:36.432
would do so well if you

21:36.535 --> 21:39.268
disappeared on her
all of a sudden.

21:39.371 --> 21:42.105
And the Deputy AG
is gonna back me up on that.

21:49.080 --> 21:54.183
But after the operation?

21:54.285 --> 21:56.452
Let's worry about that
when we have to worry about it.

22:16.424 --> 22:18.191
- There he is.
- Yeah.

22:31.639 --> 22:34.106
You want to get it now
or come back at night?

22:34.208 --> 22:37.843
Night. Let's see
where he goes next.

22:37.945 --> 22:39.312
(door closes)

22:39.414 --> 22:43.648
I'm glad you came over.
It's been a rough day.

22:43.750 --> 22:46.751
Do you maybe wanna
go see a movie tomorrow?

22:46.854 --> 22:49.087
- I can't.
- Oh, no, sure.

22:49.190 --> 22:52.791
Why even ask my girlfriend
if she wants to hang out?

22:52.893 --> 22:55.327
What about Saturday?

23:00.166 --> 23:03.034
I have to talk to you.

23:09.943 --> 23:13.378
Okay.

23:13.480 --> 23:15.112
Jesus, Paige.

23:15.215 --> 23:18.216
You don't--

23:18.318 --> 23:20.617
(voice breaking)
You don't know me, Matthew.

23:22.488 --> 23:24.355
I know you.
Come on.

23:24.457 --> 23:25.890
You like to read.

23:25.992 --> 23:27.358
You're really
into church.

23:27.460 --> 23:30.694
That's not--
That's not what I mean.

23:30.796 --> 23:33.731
Okay, so what
are you talking about?

23:33.833 --> 23:36.600
All we do is make out.
I don't want that anymore.

23:36.702 --> 23:38.201
Okay.
Okay, fine.

23:38.303 --> 23:40.771
We don't have to
make out anymore.

23:40.873 --> 23:42.840
That's it, you're not gonna
argue with me?

23:42.941 --> 23:44.575
Do you want me
to argue with you?

23:44.677 --> 23:47.010
No!

23:47.112 --> 23:48.945
Look, what do you
want me to say?!

23:49.047 --> 23:50.313
I don't know!
Something.

23:50.448 --> 23:51.882
Look, I'm not
like my dad, okay?

23:51.984 --> 23:53.616
If I-- If I did something
wrong, then I'll fix it.

23:53.718 --> 23:56.686
I can't be
your girlfriend anymore.

23:56.788 --> 23:59.256
What?

23:59.358 --> 24:02.492
I just-- I have too much
happening, and--

24:02.594 --> 24:04.494
So what?
You're too busy for me.

24:04.596 --> 24:08.063
Don't make this harder, okay?
I'm sorry.

24:08.165 --> 24:11.667
- No. Okay, just wait.
- Let go!

24:13.905 --> 24:16.939
(sobs)

24:17.041 --> 24:18.207
(sniffs)

24:18.309 --> 24:20.242
I'm sorry.

24:22.013 --> 24:23.879
(door closes)

24:28.452 --> 24:30.920
(indistinct chatter)

24:33.557 --> 24:36.458
WOMAN: Hey, y'all.
How you doing?

24:39.563 --> 24:41.897
(suspenseful music plays)

25:23.105 --> 25:24.905
- Hi there, handsome.
- Hi.

25:25.007 --> 25:27.942
Hi.

25:28.043 --> 25:31.178
(indistinct conversation)

25:46.761 --> 25:48.962
Who's she?

25:49.063 --> 25:51.430
Don't know.

25:58.740 --> 26:00.673
Let's go get it.

26:15.023 --> 26:18.724
(serene music plays)

26:36.163 --> 26:40.458
_

26:47.354 --> 26:50.188
(grunting softly)

26:51.490 --> 26:55.059
I didn't think
he was like that.

26:55.161 --> 26:56.694
You didn't
buy his act, anyway.

26:56.796 --> 27:01.699
No, but there was
something about him that--

27:01.801 --> 27:04.168
I thought that maybe...

27:08.407 --> 27:09.806
You liked him.

27:09.908 --> 27:12.709
No, I didn't like him.

27:14.213 --> 27:16.413
It's okay to care.

27:16.515 --> 27:19.550
No, it isn't, Philip.

27:19.651 --> 27:21.751
Not for me.

27:38.403 --> 27:41.104
Can you imagine?

27:41.206 --> 27:43.206
They'll plant this
back home

27:43.308 --> 27:45.241
and make better food
out of it.

27:47.112 --> 27:50.213
I feel like one of the guys
in the posters.

28:12.623 --> 28:15.524
Perfect.

28:15.660 --> 28:17.327
You wouldn't believe
the instructions

28:17.429 --> 28:19.862
I have for this thing.

28:19.965 --> 28:23.165
I have to tend it
like a baby.

28:28.573 --> 28:32.207
I've been thinking
about Paige.

28:32.309 --> 28:34.610
You did well.

28:34.712 --> 28:37.680
She doesn't think
the world owes her happiness,

28:37.782 --> 28:41.183
which is no small accomplishment
growing up in this country.

28:41.285 --> 28:46.054
Sometimes I think that
we've put too much on her.

28:46.156 --> 28:47.522
No.

28:47.624 --> 28:49.224
She has a big heart.

28:49.360 --> 28:50.892
She's not a quitter.

28:50.995 --> 28:52.927
She'll find her way.

28:56.199 --> 29:00.001
Gabriel,
why are you leaving?

29:00.103 --> 29:02.670
(sighs)

29:02.772 --> 29:06.340
It adds up.

29:06.442 --> 29:09.176
Some of it's okay,
Elizabeth.

29:09.278 --> 29:13.914
Some of it isn't.
But it adds up.

29:17.520 --> 29:20.621
What are we gonna do
without you?

29:20.723 --> 29:22.890
Well, what about me?

29:22.992 --> 29:24.825
I have one cousin
in Leningrad

29:24.927 --> 29:26.660
and a nephew
in Sverdlovsk.

29:26.762 --> 29:28.762
That's it.

29:44.146 --> 29:47.480
I leave late tonight.

29:47.582 --> 29:49.582
Send your husband
to say goodbye.

29:56.858 --> 30:00.660
(garage door closing)

30:00.762 --> 30:03.295
Hi.

30:18.379 --> 30:21.580
Mom, I broke up
with Matthew.

30:23.184 --> 30:25.317
Oh.

30:27.488 --> 30:29.821
I just--
I couldn't do it anymore.

30:29.923 --> 30:31.856
It wasn't fair to him.

30:37.464 --> 30:39.898
How did he take it?

30:40.000 --> 30:42.467
Not so great.

30:47.841 --> 30:50.208
Have you ever broken up
with someone?

30:50.310 --> 30:52.477
Yeah.

31:01.287 --> 31:06.056
I know how hard
that must have been.

31:06.159 --> 31:08.692
I'm proud of you.

31:10.062 --> 31:12.295
RENEE: My friend Ginny
and I were driving

31:12.397 --> 31:14.531
to Acadia National Park
in Maine.

31:14.634 --> 31:16.734
She's a hiker.

31:16.836 --> 31:18.869
We stopped
in Bloomington, Indiana,

31:18.971 --> 31:21.371
'cause Ginny went to school
at the U of I.

31:21.473 --> 31:23.273
And it was
real hot,

31:23.375 --> 31:26.576
so we went skinny dipping
in the rooftop quarry.

31:26.678 --> 31:28.311
And it was right there.

31:28.413 --> 31:31.581
It was right there
where they shot that.

31:31.683 --> 31:34.484
CYRIL: <i>You know,
there ain't many places</i>

31:34.620 --> 31:37.654
<i>that can hide
all four of us.</i>

31:37.756 --> 31:39.356
MICHAEL: <i>You know what
I'd like to be?</i>

31:39.458 --> 31:41.257
<i>Smart.</i>

31:41.359 --> 31:43.693
(TV shuts off)

31:43.795 --> 31:45.895
What are you doing?

31:45.997 --> 31:48.798
What's going on?

31:53.905 --> 31:56.238
Okay.

31:57.275 --> 32:00.142
(TV turns on)

32:00.244 --> 32:02.978
- (sighs)
- (sighs)

32:03.080 --> 32:06.582
<i>How'd you get to be
so stupid, Cyril?</i>

32:06.684 --> 32:09.218
<i>I don't know.</i>

32:09.320 --> 32:10.986
<i>Guess I have a dumb hereditary
or something.</i>

32:11.088 --> 32:12.421
<i>What's your excuse,
Michael?</i>

32:12.523 --> 32:14.089
(TV shuts off)

32:15.492 --> 32:18.626
My boss...

32:21.298 --> 32:25.366
I thought I was
gonna get fired the other day.

32:25.468 --> 32:28.036
What happened?

32:28.138 --> 32:34.175
Well, he called me in
and told me...

32:34.277 --> 32:36.043
There's this thing.

32:36.145 --> 32:40.181
I'd asked my boss's boss
to make this thing happen.

32:40.283 --> 32:41.649
I didn't know if
he was gonna do it or not.

32:41.751 --> 32:44.785
He was really
<i>not</i> happy about it.

32:44.887 --> 32:47.254
No one was.

32:47.356 --> 32:49.757
And when my boss
called me in,

32:49.859 --> 32:53.660
he told me the thing I pissed
everybody off asking for,

32:53.763 --> 32:56.163
well, they did it,
it happened.

32:56.265 --> 32:59.934
Which, I don't even know if he
knew the part about--

33:01.137 --> 33:03.103
Forget about that part.

33:03.205 --> 33:07.274
Anyway, then he told me
the bad news is his boss--

33:07.376 --> 33:11.211
my boss's boss--
is so pissed, he wants me fired.

33:11.313 --> 33:12.979
Well, can he do that?

33:13.081 --> 33:16.617
Just because you did
<i>that?</i>

33:16.719 --> 33:19.018
He can pretty much do
what he wants.

33:19.121 --> 33:22.155
- But not yet.
- Oh.

33:22.257 --> 33:25.324
Turns out, there's this other
thing that I'm involved with,

33:25.426 --> 33:28.762
and my boss kind of
used my involvement with that

33:28.864 --> 33:31.164
to keep me on.

33:31.266 --> 33:32.531
For now.

33:32.634 --> 33:34.267
Or maybe longer,
I don't know.

33:34.369 --> 33:36.835
Well, good, right?

33:36.937 --> 33:40.172
Yeah.

33:40.275 --> 33:42.808
(sighs)

33:42.910 --> 33:44.310
Thanks.

33:49.049 --> 33:51.317
(TV turns on)

33:56.223 --> 33:57.689
(door opens)

33:57.792 --> 34:00.558
Hey.

34:00.661 --> 34:02.828
(door closes)

34:10.036 --> 34:12.270
(Whispering)
Paige broke up with Matthew.

34:12.371 --> 34:15.172
(Whispering)
Oh.

34:15.274 --> 34:18.609
Well, thank God.

34:18.710 --> 34:19.909
How is she doing?

34:20.012 --> 34:21.878
I think okay.

34:21.980 --> 34:23.781
I mean, so-so.

34:27.453 --> 34:31.221
Gabriel leaves tonight.

34:40.299 --> 34:42.598
(knock on door)

34:47.039 --> 34:49.071
Hey.

34:49.172 --> 34:51.206
Did she tell you?

34:55.079 --> 34:57.146
Yeah.

35:01.919 --> 35:03.919
(sighs)

35:09.660 --> 35:13.562
(sighs)
Paige, I'm--

35:13.664 --> 35:15.965
I'm really sorry.

35:21.638 --> 35:25.440
I have to go
right back out.

35:25.542 --> 35:27.743
Work?

35:27.845 --> 35:31.380
Uh...

35:31.482 --> 35:35.216
Gabriel's leaving.

35:35.318 --> 35:37.986
I--
I have to see him.

35:40.723 --> 35:42.590
Tell him
I said goodbye.

35:52.468 --> 35:54.668
Scoot over.

36:08.317 --> 36:12.119
Paige,
I know how you feel.

36:12.221 --> 36:16.656
Like you're different
from everyone else, right?

36:19.661 --> 36:23.964
It's like a million times
worse than that, Dad.

36:25.567 --> 36:28.501
I felt that way
before any of this.

36:34.609 --> 36:39.446
Well...

36:39.548 --> 36:45.818
I still think you're...
a beautiful girl.

36:45.920 --> 36:52.891
And in time...

36:53.828 --> 36:55.861
you'll get used to
these things.

36:59.367 --> 37:00.899
Thanks, Dad.

38:21.212 --> 38:23.146
Really.

38:23.248 --> 38:26.482
That's good of you to say.

38:26.584 --> 38:28.784
We've had
our ups and downs.

I'm glad it's all
ending on this--

you know,
something good.

I doubt we'll ever

Elizabeth's doing

39:16.865 --> 39:18.665
in the
psychiatrist's office?

39:20.069 --> 39:22.069
She got us
some information on people

39:22.171 --> 39:24.405
who are part of
a well-organized opposition

39:24.507 --> 39:26.340
to the party at home.

39:36.218 --> 39:41.154
Can I ask you something?

39:41.256 --> 39:45.658
You said when you were younger,
you did...

39:45.760 --> 39:50.563
terrible things.

39:50.665 --> 39:54.167
What things?

39:54.269 --> 39:55.768
When you signed up,

39:55.870 --> 39:58.971
how much did you know about
what we did

39:59.073 --> 40:02.108
before
and after the war?

40:02.209 --> 40:04.043
People were
talking about it.

40:04.145 --> 40:05.745
- What did you think?
- I didn't.

40:05.847 --> 40:07.747
I didn't ask questions.

40:11.318 --> 40:15.320
Well, it was bad.

40:15.422 --> 40:20.492
It was worse
than you could imagine.

40:20.594 --> 40:23.562
People were shot,

40:23.664 --> 40:26.998
worked to death
in the camps.

40:27.134 --> 40:31.170
Some were
counterrevolutionaries.

40:31.272 --> 40:33.172
But some...

40:35.475 --> 40:38.643
Some hadn't done
anything.

40:40.047 --> 40:41.680
Just people.

40:46.553 --> 40:48.219
I did it too.

40:52.792 --> 40:54.158
Why?

40:54.260 --> 40:59.930
To set an example.
I, uh-- who knows?

41:00.032 --> 41:01.999
The organization was
filled with people

41:02.101 --> 41:07.771
who were scared
and confused.

41:07.873 --> 41:09.172
But not you?

41:09.274 --> 41:11.675
No.

41:11.776 --> 41:13.843
I believed
I was acting

41:13.945 --> 41:17.681
in the service
of a higher purpose.

41:17.782 --> 41:21.184
But I was just scared.

41:21.286 --> 41:27.356
It was terrible,
terrible times.

41:27.458 --> 41:30.860
And a lot of us--

41:30.962 --> 41:34.530
a lot of us
didn't make it either.

41:42.873 --> 41:45.307
(scoffs)

41:45.409 --> 41:46.642
I have to go.

41:56.153 --> 41:58.887
(Bag rustling)

42:14.238 --> 42:19.774
Is Stan Beeman's
new girlfriend one of us?

42:19.876 --> 42:23.278
Are you serious?

42:23.380 --> 42:26.781
(sighs)
You're losing it, Philip.

42:26.883 --> 42:29.116
That's not an answer,
Gabriel.

42:29.218 --> 42:30.851
No.

42:30.953 --> 42:33.420
It's possible the Centre
wouldn't tell me

42:33.522 --> 42:36.423
because they knew
you'd ask me this question.

42:36.525 --> 42:39.593
As far as I know,
she is not one of us.

42:48.604 --> 42:50.570
You were right
about Paige.

42:52.908 --> 42:57.076
She should be
kept out of all this.
