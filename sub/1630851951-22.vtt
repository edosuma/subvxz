00:04.138 --> 00:06.171
- Alright, all done, Ms. Leah.

00:06.173 --> 00:09.508
- Mm, thank you, Lindor.

00:09.510 --> 00:12.511
So, just like a
businessman will tell you,

00:12.513 --> 00:15.948
the best way to solve a problem
is to prevent the problem

00:15.950 --> 00:17.549
before it starts.

00:17.551 --> 00:20.019
- I wish Brown's mommy and daddy
had lived by the same motto.

00:20.021 --> 00:23.322
- [laughter]
- Efe, Efe, not now.

00:23.324 --> 00:25.524
I want us to take
this seriously.

00:25.526 --> 00:28.127
- I'm serious.
- [laughter]

00:28.129 --> 00:30.195
- Prevent the problem.

00:30.197 --> 00:32.865
By the time trouble starts,
it's often too late.

00:32.867 --> 00:34.366
- Hence, my point.

00:34.368 --> 00:36.702
Brown is now here and
we're stuck with him.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.070
- [laughter]

00:38.072 --> 00:40.072
- Nurse Leah, this is
wisdom, my lady.

00:40.074 --> 00:42.408
I only wish that some of
the folks in my courtroom

00:42.410 --> 00:44.143
could've understood
such simple facts.

00:44.145 --> 00:45.711
- Thank you, Judge Junie.

00:45.713 --> 00:48.280
The same principle
applies to your health.

00:48.282 --> 00:52.051
Preventive medicine is
about preventing diseases

00:52.053 --> 00:55.521
and other health problems
before they develop.

00:55.523 --> 00:58.590
- Ah, thank you
for setting up

00:58.592 --> 01:00.959
this health fair for
us, Nurse Leah.

01:00.961 --> 01:02.528
It is a blessing.

01:02.530 --> 01:06.432
In my country, healthcare's
not so readily available.

01:06.434 --> 01:08.133
- It's not always readily
available here either.

01:08.135 --> 01:09.468
- [doorbell]

01:09.470 --> 01:10.869
- Church service
was more drama

01:10.871 --> 01:13.772
than any of the Chitlin
Circuit theater I did.

01:13.774 --> 01:16.408
- Well, I didn't know
if we were, I didn't know

01:16.410 --> 01:18.610
if we was at church or
doing a reality show.

01:18.612 --> 01:21.980
I thought they was
gonna start fightin'

01:21.982 --> 01:23.916
- I am so sorry, Ms. Anastasia.

01:23.918 --> 01:25.818
I'm just, I'm just embarrassed.

01:25.820 --> 01:27.553
I cannot believe this.

01:27.555 --> 01:29.254
Hey Lindor, baby,
how you doing?

01:29.256 --> 01:31.557
- Hey Ms. Cora.
What happened in church?

01:31.559 --> 01:34.159
- The pastor's wife told
the whole congregation

01:34.161 --> 01:37.629
that her husband, the pastor,
had been sowing his wild oats

01:37.631 --> 01:40.232
with two women among
the congregation.

01:40.234 --> 01:42.000
- Sowing oats?

01:42.002 --> 01:44.002
What is that?
- [laughter]

01:44.004 --> 01:46.271
- You, you don't get it?

01:46.273 --> 01:47.639
The pastor was a rolling stone.
- [laughter]

01:47.641 --> 01:50.576
- Mr. Brown.
- What's a rolling stone?

01:50.578 --> 01:54.179
- He was doing love, boy.
- Oh.

01:54.181 --> 01:56.048
- MR. BROWN: You
young people.

01:56.050 --> 01:57.749
- The pastor's a playa.

01:57.751 --> 01:59.952
- It's not funny, sweetheart.
That's not funny.

01:59.954 --> 02:01.553
- My bad, I'm sorry.

02:01.555 --> 02:03.655
- Oh yes, Lindor, when
you finish all that mopping,

02:03.657 --> 02:05.624
can you go outside
and grab all that mail

02:05.626 --> 02:07.259
that's stuffed in
that mailbox, please?

02:07.261 --> 02:08.927
- Yes, ma'am.

02:08.929 --> 02:12.731
- Far be it for me to judge but
your pastor's just ridiculous.

02:12.733 --> 02:15.434
I mean, I'm not above
having a side piece,

02:15.436 --> 02:17.636
but I would never
stoop to his level.

02:17.638 --> 02:21.573
I mean, I had my husband and
my boyfriend, but that's it.

02:21.575 --> 02:24.843
Anything more would be
just disrespectful.

02:24.845 --> 02:27.980
- I'm so disappointed.
I can not believe Pastor.

02:27.982 --> 02:30.616
And I enjoy his sermons so.

02:30.618 --> 02:33.752
And now we gotta go
find a new church home.

02:33.754 --> 02:37.322
- Well, if he's a good
pastor, why leave?

02:37.324 --> 02:41.260
- Me and Cora don't play
all of that foolishness.

02:41.262 --> 02:43.362
We don't do all of that.

02:43.364 --> 02:45.230
And besides,
this is grown folk talk.

02:45.232 --> 02:47.299
- That's right.

02:47.301 --> 02:50.869
- Cora, I am so sorry you're
pastor disappointed you.

02:50.871 --> 02:55.674
Um, I'm gonna go check
out Leah's health fair.

02:55.676 --> 03:00.679
This is absolutely fabulous,
Leah.

03:00.681 --> 03:03.715
Oh, Marilyn would be
so proud of us.

03:03.717 --> 03:04.950
God rest her soul.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.285
- Yes, ma'am.

03:06.287 --> 03:08.187
She inspired this.

03:08.189 --> 03:10.489
We have to take care
of our bodies.

03:10.491 --> 03:12.324
- Hey Judge Junie, I
got some mail for you.

03:12.326 --> 03:15.360
- For me? I haven't
given anyone this address.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.863
- Didn't you write your son?

03:17.865 --> 03:19.398
- Oh, yes.

Yes, yes, uh, he must have

I'm a little upset about what's
going on down at the church.

07:14.835 --> 07:17.035
It's got my nerves bad.

07:17.037 --> 07:18.703
they was carrying on
down there yesterday.

07:18.705 --> 07:20.939
- Yeah, I mean it's awful.
Terrible.

I know you really

07:22.843 --> 07:24.209
liked that pastor, too.
- Yes.

I don't know no other pastor
that can preach like him.

body of Christ.

- Alright, now you do this one.

07:47.684 --> 07:49.317
What are the reactants?

09:07.664 --> 09:09.097
to meet with
his son today.

09:09.099 --> 09:11.533
He hasn't seen him in,
like, ten years or something.

09:11.535 --> 09:15.670
- Wow, good for him.
- Yeah.

09:15.672 --> 09:18.273
- You are such a disease!
- [audience laughter]

09:18.275 --> 09:20.141
- Well, hello to you, too.
- [audience laughter]

09:20.143 --> 09:22.577
- You're dishonest and
you're a thief.

09:22.579 --> 09:24.446
- Dang girl, what I do?

09:24.448 --> 09:27.282
- What's going on?
- Dad, look at this.

09:27.284 --> 09:29.417
- Oh.
- [audience laughter]

09:29.419 --> 09:33.121
- Yeah, I'm just gonna
study, uh, alone.

09:33.123 --> 09:34.823
- [audience laughter]

09:34.825 --> 09:37.259
- Pump your brakes.
You're not going nowhere.

09:37.261 --> 09:39.494
- All this time I've been
looking for my jacket,

09:39.496 --> 09:41.463
and look at this picture
I just saw online.

09:41.465 --> 09:43.064
Philip took my jacket
to the Migos concert

09:43.066 --> 09:45.500
without my permission.
- Wait, I made it online?

09:45.502 --> 09:47.636
- [audience laughter]

09:47.638 --> 09:49.838
- Philip, why did you do that?

09:49.840 --> 09:51.806
- I'm not gonna lie, Dad.

09:51.808 --> 09:54.175
The jacket just went
really well with my outfit.

09:54.177 --> 09:55.577
- [audience laughter]
- Yeah, give me my

09:55.579 --> 09:57.045
jacket, Philip.

09:57.047 --> 10:00.515
- I-I wish I could,
but I lost it.

10:00.517 --> 10:01.883
- You lost my jacket?

10:01.885 --> 10:04.986
- Hey look, I didn't mean to.
I'm sorry.

10:04.988 --> 10:08.123
- What did I tell you
about losing things?

10:08.125 --> 10:10.659
And how do you lose a jacket
that you're wearing?

10:10.661 --> 10:12.494
- Alright, look,
it's not my fault.

10:12.496 --> 10:14.129
So, I'm at the concert, right?

10:14.131 --> 10:16.331
And then they start
playing "Walk It Talk It".

10:16.333 --> 10:18.700
And I'm feeling it, right?

10:18.702 --> 10:20.969
- [audience laughter]
- Right, right, right.

10:20.971 --> 10:22.871
And then, and then,
I'm getting a little hot.

10:22.873 --> 10:24.172
So, I take the jacket off.

10:24.174 --> 10:26.207
Then, they start playing
"Bad and Bougie".

10:26.209 --> 10:30.045
Now, I'm really in the zone.
- [audience laughter]

10:30.047 --> 10:32.914
- Okay, okay and the next thing
you know, the jacket's gone.

10:32.916 --> 10:35.550
- Dad, you have to
do something.

10:35.552 --> 10:36.951
- So, why didn't you
say something?

10:36.953 --> 10:39.521
- I was gonna go online
to replace it.

10:39.523 --> 10:42.457
But look at this,
it's one of a kind.

10:42.459 --> 10:44.292
Special edition.
Who, who woulda knew?

10:44.294 --> 10:45.694
- [audience laughter]

10:45.696 --> 10:47.662
- Only one is in the world
and she got it.

10:47.664 --> 10:50.098
How?
Look, look, I'm sorry.

10:50.100 --> 10:52.233
- I will never forgive
you for this.

10:52.235 --> 10:54.769
You guys let him get
away with everything.

10:54.771 --> 10:56.871
- Come on, Sandra,
wait a minute.

10:56.873 --> 10:58.139
- A little dramatic.
- [audience laughter]

10:58.141 --> 11:00.308
- It's a danim jacket,
a denim jacket.

11:05.582 --> 11:07.782
- Wow.
- [audience laughter]

11:07.784 --> 11:11.119
- Right? I mean,
and you wanna date that.

11:11.121 --> 11:12.754
- [audience laughter]
- I think you should make

11:12.756 --> 11:15.256
up with your sister. It'll
make it a lot easier on me.

11:15.258 --> 11:16.624
- [audience laughter]

11:16.626 --> 11:21.896
- Eh, look, I know my sister.

11:21.898 --> 11:25.734
She's just gonna be mad
for the rest of the century.

11:25.736 --> 11:27.802
Good luck.
- [audience laughter]

11:27.804 --> 11:29.137
- Alright, man, well,
just hurry up.

11:29.139 --> 11:31.072
We gotta go downtown.
- Alright.

11:31.074 --> 11:32.273
- [door bell]

11:35.145 --> 11:36.978
- Hey Judge Junie.

11:36.980 --> 11:38.947
You looking sharp in
that outfit, man.

11:38.949 --> 11:40.915
- Too bad I can't
take it back.

11:40.917 --> 11:44.285
- I heard you were meeting
up with your son, right?

11:44.287 --> 11:46.588
- You heard wrong.

11:46.590 --> 11:48.890
- Is everything okay?
- He stood me up.

11:48.892 --> 11:52.360
- What, he didn't come?

11:52.362 --> 11:55.864
- No, my son hates me.

11:59.970 --> 12:01.469
- ♪
- Don't say that Judge.

12:01.471 --> 12:03.605
I'm sure your son
doesn't hate you.

12:03.607 --> 12:06.808
- Oh, he does.
- Why do say that?

12:06.810 --> 12:09.043
- When I divorced his mother...

12:09.045 --> 12:14.315
- You divorced him too.
- No, I was always present.

12:14.317 --> 12:18.286
- Were you like my dad,
mean and strict?

12:18.288 --> 12:23.324
- I was a firm disciplinarian,
yes, but nothing Draconian.

12:25.729 --> 12:29.731
- I'm sorry, what?

12:29.733 --> 12:32.300
- You young people oughta
read something sometimes.

12:32.302 --> 12:34.903
I didn't go overboard.

12:34.905 --> 12:39.941
Uh, like I heard your dad did.

12:39.943 --> 12:41.676
- Okay, so then
what happened?

12:41.678 --> 12:44.345
- College happened.
- College?

12:44.347 --> 12:48.883
- He got so radical
and down for the cause

12:48.885 --> 12:51.686
and we would argue.

12:51.688 --> 12:55.056
At first, I thought it
was healthy debate.

12:55.058 --> 12:58.693
But it became more
bitter and resentful.

12:58.695 --> 13:01.930
- What were you guys
arguing about?

13:01.932 --> 13:05.200
- He didn't like
the judicial system.

13:05.202 --> 13:08.369
And his dad was part
of the judicial system.

13:08.371 --> 13:10.638
- Huh, my dad too.

13:10.640 --> 13:13.208
He's a, he's a sheriff.

13:13.210 --> 13:16.377
- Yeah, he likes to
dance, too, I heard.

13:16.379 --> 13:17.812
- [audience laughter]

13:17.814 --> 13:20.949
- Yeah, word gets around
pretty fast around here.

13:20.951 --> 13:23.351
- I don't want to bore you.
I'm sure you've got

13:23.353 --> 13:25.420
some place to be.
- You're not, you're not

13:25.422 --> 13:27.689
boring me at all.
I'm just waiting on Philip

13:27.691 --> 13:28.990
to go downtown.
- Hmm.

13:28.992 --> 13:30.625
- Plus I like talking
to old people.

13:30.627 --> 13:31.993
- [audience laughter]

13:31.995 --> 13:34.262
- But no, I meant I
really I think, um,

13:34.264 --> 13:36.865
more young guys like us need
wisdom from your generation.

13:36.867 --> 13:38.633
- Yeah.
- So, your son didn't like the

13:38.635 --> 13:41.669
fact that you were a judge?

13:41.671 --> 13:43.838
- Well, he did not.

13:43.840 --> 13:46.441
But I, on the other hand,

13:46.443 --> 13:48.576
was proud that I got criminals
off the street.

13:48.578 --> 13:53.114
I-I took pride in helping
make our streets safer.

13:53.116 --> 13:55.049
- Safer?
What, you didn't lock up a

13:55.051 --> 13:57.051
bunch of our brothers did you?
- I did.

13:57.053 --> 13:59.554
I-I locked up anyone
who committed a crime

13:59.556 --> 14:01.122
and I was very
proud of that.

14:01.124 --> 14:02.490
- The system throws
us black men away

14:02.492 --> 14:05.159
like our lives don't matter
and you were part of that?

14:05.161 --> 14:07.996
- Oh, no, you are starting
to sound just like my son.

14:07.998 --> 14:09.430
- But Judge, it's the truth.

14:09.432 --> 14:11.032
Alright, black men in
the judicial system--

14:11.034 --> 14:13.001
- Should make sure they
stay away from there

14:13.003 --> 14:17.772
if they really believed
their lives mattered.

14:17.774 --> 14:23.778
- Speaking of, Philip and I are
on our way to a peaceful vigil.

14:23.780 --> 14:26.948
- You are just like my son.

14:26.950 --> 14:28.349
- Uh, you ready?

14:28.351 --> 14:30.618
Um, my dad said I gotta
be back in two hours.

14:30.620 --> 14:35.490
- Goodnight, gentlemen.
Please, stay safe out there.

14:35.492 --> 14:37.392
- Yeah, goodnight, Judge.

14:40.730 --> 14:44.032
I'll be praying for you and
your son to patch things up.

14:44.034 --> 14:49.837
- Oh, that prayer has gone
unanswered for over ten years.

14:49.839 --> 14:52.206
- Sorry.

14:52.208 --> 14:54.576
- [knock at door]
- Knock, knock, knock.

14:54.578 --> 14:55.977
- Come in.

14:55.979 --> 14:57.345
- I found these clothes
in the laundry.

14:57.347 --> 14:59.147
- Oh, thank you.
I was just about to

14:59.149 --> 15:01.082
go grab them.
- Well, I figured since

15:01.084 --> 15:03.318
I was down there,
I'd just save you a trip.

15:03.320 --> 15:04.819
- Bless yo' heart
'cause you know

15:04.821 --> 15:06.287
those stairs can
take you out.

15:06.289 --> 15:10.425
- [laughter]
- You telling me.

15:10.427 --> 15:15.163
- I heard your pastor made
a public apology today.

15:15.165 --> 15:18.866
- Yeah, I heard, but I ain't
thinking about that man.

15:18.868 --> 15:20.368
- Mom.

15:20.370 --> 15:22.437
- Uh, honey, you see
Ms. Cora and I talking?

15:22.439 --> 15:24.772
- Sorry, Ms. Cora.
Mom, I need my own room.

15:24.774 --> 15:27.575
- I-I-I know you're father
and I have talked about it.

15:27.577 --> 15:30.211
Uh, y'all are too old to be
staying in the room together.

15:30.213 --> 15:32.146
- Mom, please.
I can't stay in there with him.

15:32.148 --> 15:33.715
- Well, what happened?

15:33.717 --> 15:35.650
- He stole my jacket
and then lost it.

15:35.652 --> 15:37.852
- Well, your dad told me.

15:37.854 --> 15:39.721
- I'm never talking
to him again.

15:39.723 --> 15:41.889
- Now, wait a minute,
now, hold on.

15:41.891 --> 15:43.191
He is your brother.

15:43.193 --> 15:45.259
You can't just stop
talking to him forever.

15:45.261 --> 15:46.694
- He's not my brother
anymore.

15:46.696 --> 15:49.297
- Well, did he apologize?
- Yes, but he should've

15:49.299 --> 15:51.866
never touched my stuff
without asking me.

15:51.868 --> 15:53.701
- Well, you have
a point there.

15:53.703 --> 15:55.637
That's true, but
he's your brother.

15:55.639 --> 15:56.871
And sometimes
family members

15:56.873 --> 15:58.640
do things that
we don't like

15:58.642 --> 16:00.541
but family is
all we have.

16:00.543 --> 16:02.610
- Mmhmm, Cora's right.

16:02.612 --> 16:05.113
That's your only brother
and you know how he is.

16:05.115 --> 16:06.447
- And that's not the point.

16:06.449 --> 16:08.716
He can't keep taking
my stuff without asking me.

16:08.718 --> 16:11.052
It's unforgivable.

16:11.054 --> 16:13.087
- Oh, that girl has to,
she gotta calm down.

16:13.089 --> 16:14.989
She's just, she just have to.

16:14.991 --> 16:17.725
- She will.
- Well, you know what?

16:17.727 --> 16:20.428
You gotta learn to forgive
people when they apologize.

16:20.430 --> 16:23.297
- Does that go for
your pastor too, Cora?

16:30.907 --> 16:33.007
- There you are.

16:33.009 --> 16:35.309
By all the bacon
in the refrigerator,

16:35.311 --> 16:38.212
I see you're back
to eating meat.

16:38.214 --> 16:41.416
- I just can't leave it alone.
I can't let that bacon go.

16:41.418 --> 16:43.551
I-I been praying.

16:43.553 --> 16:45.553
- About what?
- Bacon.

16:45.555 --> 16:47.522
- [audience laughter]

16:47.524 --> 16:49.924
- You've been praying
about bacon?

16:49.926 --> 16:51.759
- I been praying,
I been praying

16:51.761 --> 16:55.296
that I can get all the nutrients
that I need from bacon.

16:55.298 --> 16:56.631
Bacon, bacon, bacon.
- [audience laughter]

16:56.633 --> 16:59.967
- So, all the, what
the wellness, the health fair,

16:59.969 --> 17:03.604
everything about eating healthy,
it doesn't mean anything to you?

17:03.606 --> 17:06.174
- I just can't give up the pig.
The pig is my friend.

17:06.176 --> 17:08.943
- Yeah? Go, sit down.

17:08.945 --> 17:10.478
- What, what you--
- Sit down, my friend.

17:10.480 --> 17:12.513
- Well, you ain't got
to be so aggressive.

17:12.515 --> 17:15.116
You just, y'all--why y'all
tone is always sit down?

17:15.118 --> 17:16.617
- [audience laughter]
- Like you like Arnold

17:16.619 --> 17:17.919
Schwarzenegger.
- Shh.

17:17.921 --> 17:20.088
- Sit down now!
- Try this.

17:20.090 --> 17:21.622
- What is that?

17:21.624 --> 17:23.024
- Try it now.

17:27.597 --> 17:29.397
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

17:29.399 --> 17:32.333
- That's Jambalaya.
- Yes.

17:32.335 --> 17:36.304
- Yeah, I recognize that.
That's good Jambalaya.

17:36.306 --> 17:38.906
I like Jambalaya.
- And me too.

17:38.908 --> 17:40.608
- You made this?
- Yes.

17:40.610 --> 17:42.443
- See, I told you, pig.

17:42.445 --> 17:46.514
That makes stuff
taste better, the pig.

17:46.516 --> 17:49.050
- No meat.

17:49.052 --> 17:52.019
- You a lie.
That's sausage.

17:52.021 --> 17:54.889
- I liked Ms. Leah's talk
about preventive health.

17:54.891 --> 17:56.224
We have to keep eating healthy.

17:56.226 --> 17:58.493
We only have one body, yo.

17:58.495 --> 18:00.428
- Well, meat does
my body good.

18:00.430 --> 18:02.130
- [audience laughter]
- Look at this meat body.

18:02.132 --> 18:04.165
- [audience laughter]

18:04.167 --> 18:06.701
- Huh, damn.

18:06.703 --> 18:09.303
You should never eat
meat in this life or the next.

18:09.305 --> 18:11.205
- [audience laughter]
- [door bell]

18:11.207 --> 18:13.441
- Mom, Dad.
Mom.

18:13.443 --> 18:15.109
Mr. Brown, where,
where is my dad?

18:15.111 --> 18:16.544
- In the back somewhere.
What?

18:16.546 --> 18:17.945
- What's wrong?

18:17.947 --> 18:19.413
- The, the police are
chasing us man.

18:19.415 --> 18:21.149
- For what?
- W-w-w-we were

18:21.151 --> 18:22.984
at a peaceful protest
and when we were

18:22.986 --> 18:24.452
leaving, the cops
just started following us.

18:24.454 --> 18:26.087
- What's wrong?
- Dad, Dad, the police

18:26.089 --> 18:27.455
were following us.

18:27.457 --> 18:28.923
- They were following,
for what?

18:28.925 --> 18:30.324
- Everything okay?
