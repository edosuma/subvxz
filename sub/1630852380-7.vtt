WEBVTT

00:05.396 --> 00:07.224
WOMAN:
I've made my decision.

00:07.268 --> 00:08.878
LIAM [over phone]:
Okay, what's that?

00:08.921 --> 00:12.403
You were right.
The other day in my office.

00:12.447 --> 00:15.276
That wasgoodbye.

00:15.319 --> 00:17.017
I can't do this anymore.

00:17.060 --> 00:19.584
I love Cutler.

00:19.628 --> 00:23.197
What we have is real.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.503
I'm sorry, Lionel, but...

00:25.547 --> 00:27.244
it's over.

00:27.288 --> 00:29.333
[crying]

00:34.512 --> 00:36.079
FALLON:
What the hell is she doing?

00:36.123 --> 00:39.169
The only time I've ever
cried like that was never.

00:39.213 --> 00:40.562
Aren't I the producer here?

00:40.605 --> 00:42.216
Why are you involved
in casting again?

00:42.259 --> 00:44.566
Well, since the character
is based on me,

00:44.609 --> 00:46.394
Liam thought I'd
have some insight.

00:46.437 --> 00:49.092
Not to mention, who let all
these freaks into our house?

00:49.136 --> 00:51.225
Well, Nina felt that having
them audition in this space

00:51.268 --> 00:52.748
would help them
get into character.

00:52.791 --> 00:54.271
Well, guess what?
It didn't work.

00:54.315 --> 00:56.404
Plus, actors are
notorious thieves.

00:56.447 --> 00:58.232
I noticed that all
the decorative soaps

00:58.275 --> 00:59.885
were missing from
the East powder room.

00:59.929 --> 01:01.235
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:01.278 --> 01:02.888
I thought we agreed

01:02.932 --> 01:04.586
you were no longer allowed
to look at auditions.

01:04.629 --> 01:07.806
Mm-hmm.I'm not sure we agreed to that.

01:07.850 --> 01:10.374
Well, it doesn't matter,
since all those ladies

01:10.418 --> 01:13.290
are backups to this one.

01:13.334 --> 01:15.118
MICHAEL:
Janelle Crowley?

01:15.162 --> 01:16.467
Ooh! Yes, you see?

01:16.511 --> 01:18.034
This is what I'm talking about.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.123
If somebody is going
to play Fallon...

01:20.167 --> 01:22.212
Farrah.then they need to
be as impressive

01:22.256 --> 01:23.779
as the real deal.

01:23.822 --> 01:25.868
She's basically the next Meryl,
with the mystique of Gaga

01:25.911 --> 01:27.435
and the environmentalism
of DiCaprio.

01:27.478 --> 01:28.697
Not to mention,

01:28.740 --> 01:30.220
the financiers were
threatening to pull out

01:30.264 --> 01:31.526
if we didn't land someone big.

01:31.569 --> 01:32.962
Well, I didn't think
she was interested.

01:33.005 --> 01:35.138
There's a few contingencies.

01:35.182 --> 01:37.271
One major one.

01:37.314 --> 01:40.317
Janelle wants to shadow Fallon
for 48 hours starting today

01:40.361 --> 01:42.145
before she makes
her decision.

01:43.451 --> 01:44.887
Hey, look, if it's
too much to ask...

01:44.930 --> 01:48.673
No. Nothing is too much for you.

01:48.717 --> 01:50.327
After all you've
done for me?

01:50.371 --> 01:52.242
I've been waiting for a chance
to return the favor,

01:52.286 --> 01:54.418
and this is it.Thank you.

01:54.462 --> 01:56.725
Not to mention,
associating myself

01:56.768 --> 01:58.466
with a well-known
eco-activist like Janelle

01:58.509 --> 02:00.946
could really boost
consumer confidence

02:00.990 --> 02:02.818
as we kick things back up
with Morell Green.

02:02.861 --> 02:04.472
There's that ulterior motive.

02:04.515 --> 02:06.865
Oh, "ulterior" sounds so ugly.

02:06.909 --> 02:09.129
But can you go 48 hours
without spooking

02:09.172 --> 02:11.609
an eco-conscious do-gooder
like Janelle Crowley?

02:11.653 --> 02:13.524
Of course I can.
I'm an open book.

02:13.568 --> 02:14.960
I've got nothing to hide.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.398
[phone vibrates][phone chimes]

02:18.399 --> 02:19.400
Got to go.
Family meeting.

02:19.443 --> 02:20.705
Tell Janelle's people

02:20.749 --> 02:21.967
I am ready for my close-up.

02:22.011 --> 02:23.186
BLAKE:
PPA's expansion

02:23.230 --> 02:25.362
is underway.
But the company needs

02:25.406 --> 02:27.538
more than private fliers
to survive.

02:27.582 --> 02:29.845
The airport construction costs
are too high.

02:29.888 --> 02:31.934
Is this some kind
of PPA prospectus?

02:31.977 --> 02:34.241
Are we supposed to know
what PPA means?

02:34.284 --> 02:37.026
Primetime Private Air.
It's my company.

02:37.069 --> 02:39.942
I need a major commercial client
to raise the bottom line.

02:39.985 --> 02:42.031
So if you have any leads,
I'm all ears.

02:42.074 --> 02:44.381
Anything to boost freight
traffic through my airport.

02:44.425 --> 02:46.209
I missed breakfast
with my father for this?

02:46.253 --> 02:47.863
AMANDA:Yeah, I know
I'm new here,

02:47.906 --> 02:49.517
but this doesn't
really seem worthy

02:49.560 --> 02:51.301
of, like, an in-person
family meeting.

02:52.302 --> 02:53.564
There's one other matter.

02:53.608 --> 02:55.175
This may sound strange,

02:55.218 --> 02:56.828
but for the past three weeks,

02:56.872 --> 02:58.439
the woman that we all
thought was Cristal

02:58.482 --> 03:01.398
was actually
an imposter named Rita.

03:02.486 --> 03:03.705
"May" sound strange?

03:03.748 --> 03:04.880
Yeah, how is that even possible?

03:04.923 --> 03:05.924
If she was an imposter,

03:05.968 --> 03:07.622
then where have you been?

03:07.665 --> 03:10.712
Beto kidnapped me and kept me
locked in a basement

03:10.755 --> 03:13.715
so he could use this woman to
steal back our family business.

03:13.758 --> 03:16.326
But he's gone and she's in jail.

03:16.370 --> 03:17.849
So you're saying
I let a nonprofessional

03:17.893 --> 03:18.937
massage my spine?

03:20.069 --> 03:22.941
I mean... are you okay?

03:22.985 --> 03:24.595
I'm fine.

03:24.639 --> 03:27.032
And the sooner I can stop
thinking about this, the better.

03:27.076 --> 03:29.252
I can't believe we didn't know.

03:29.296 --> 03:30.819
Although I did think
it was weird

03:30.862 --> 03:32.037
you gave me such good advice.

03:32.081 --> 03:33.256
None of you could have known.

03:33.300 --> 03:34.779
Beto trained Rita perfectly.

03:34.823 --> 03:36.738
But it's over.

03:36.781 --> 03:39.436
And I'm moving on.
We all should.

03:40.481 --> 03:41.743
BLAKE:
Well, good.

03:41.786 --> 03:43.658
Family meeting adjourned.

03:44.659 --> 03:45.877
Okay.

03:49.316 --> 03:51.492
CHARLIE:
As you know,
I sent your materials

03:51.535 --> 03:53.450
to several print ad
casting calls.

03:53.494 --> 03:55.191
Ooh, you're scaring me
with this tone.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.454
No tone. And while the response
hasn't been as immediate

03:57.498 --> 03:59.935
as I had hoped...Oh, I knew we sent in
the wrong pictures.

03:59.978 --> 04:02.198
I had crazy eye
bags that day,

04:02.242 --> 04:03.852
and I'm talking checked
bags, not carry-on.

04:03.895 --> 04:05.636
No, that's not what I mean...It's okay.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.464
We just have to take new ones.
I can fund a shoot.

04:07.508 --> 04:09.988
Kirby, please stop speaking

04:10.032 --> 04:11.555
and let me talk for one second.

04:11.599 --> 04:14.166
You don't need
print ads because...

04:14.210 --> 04:15.646
I booked you
a shampoo commercial.

04:15.690 --> 04:17.039
It shoots tomorrow.Really?

04:17.082 --> 04:18.997
Shampoo commercials are,
like, the holy grail

04:19.041 --> 04:20.825
of modeling, and it's
shooting tomorrow?

04:20.869 --> 04:22.044
Am I dreaming?

04:22.087 --> 04:23.132
Want me to pinch you?

04:23.175 --> 04:24.351
Yeah.

04:24.394 --> 04:25.526
[gasps]

04:28.311 --> 04:29.704
Um...

04:29.747 --> 04:31.358
you know I've never
acted before, right?

04:31.401 --> 04:32.924
As long as your gorgeous hair
can act, we're good.

04:32.968 --> 04:35.449
But let's keep the holes
in your résumé to ourselves.

04:35.492 --> 04:37.625
I may have told the client
you're an experienced actress.

04:38.626 --> 04:39.757
SAM:
Stop number 33

04:39.801 --> 04:41.803
on the grand tour,

04:41.846 --> 04:43.631
my bedroom.[sighs]: Oh, great.

04:43.674 --> 04:45.197
because I could use a break.

04:45.241 --> 04:46.547
Yeah, this place is huge, and...
[chuckles]

04:46.590 --> 04:47.635
I'm not as young
as I used to be.

04:47.678 --> 04:49.332
Oh, tell me about it.

04:49.376 --> 04:51.769
I can only go out dancing
three nights a week these days.

04:51.813 --> 04:53.249
Aging is such a drag.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.556
[phone chimes]

04:55.599 --> 04:56.774
What?

04:56.818 --> 04:58.341
What? What's wrong?

04:58.385 --> 05:00.169
Apparently a rock band staying
in the presidential suite

05:00.212 --> 05:01.692
started a small fire.

05:01.736 --> 05:03.781
Just one second
while I deal with this.

05:03.825 --> 05:06.523
Hello? What do you mean?

05:06.567 --> 05:07.916
[door closes]

05:19.493 --> 05:21.495
[door opens]BLAKE: Everything okay in here?

05:21.538 --> 05:23.061
Yes, of course.

05:23.105 --> 05:24.236
Uh, Blake, right?

05:24.280 --> 05:25.542
I don't think
we've officially met.

05:25.586 --> 05:26.935
Right.

05:26.978 --> 05:29.416
Daniel, Fallon's horse trainer.

05:30.547 --> 05:32.027
You can call me Mr. Carrington.

05:32.070 --> 05:33.768
And then you can tell me
what you were just doing.

05:35.639 --> 05:37.728
Sorry, false alarm.

05:37.772 --> 05:40.209
Literally. Our smoke alarms
are too sensitive.

05:40.252 --> 05:42.777
I knew we spent
too much money on safety.

05:42.820 --> 05:43.778
I see you two have met.

05:43.821 --> 05:44.953
Yes, we have.

05:44.996 --> 05:46.824
Could I have a word?

05:46.868 --> 05:48.130
Oh, maybe later?

05:48.173 --> 05:49.436
I'm gonna let my father
catch his breath

05:49.479 --> 05:50.654
and then we're gonna
continue the tour.

05:50.698 --> 05:52.526
Everything okay?

05:52.569 --> 05:54.397
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just perfect.

05:54.441 --> 05:57.269
Lemonade?Yes, please.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.319
FALLON:
Morell Green

06:03.363 --> 06:06.104
is kind of our
environmental North Star.

06:06.148 --> 06:08.977
With Jeff Colby leading the way,
the rest of the company

06:09.020 --> 06:12.372
will follow his example
as we build a better world.

06:15.070 --> 06:16.114
He should be here any minute.

06:16.158 --> 06:17.899
When this offer
first came in,

06:17.942 --> 06:19.466
I thought the character
was just a spoiled oil heiress.

06:19.509 --> 06:20.728
[chuckles]But now,

06:20.771 --> 06:23.687
seeing your eco-conscious side,

06:23.731 --> 06:25.689
I knew there
had to be more layers.

06:25.733 --> 06:27.778
I'm like an onion, you know.

06:27.822 --> 06:29.432
But I'm just flattered

06:29.476 --> 06:31.260
that you're considering
taking the role.

06:31.303 --> 06:33.654
I mean, I've been a fan of yours
since you were on that soap.

06:33.697 --> 06:35.090
You know, the one where you...

06:35.133 --> 06:36.744
you did CPR
in a bikini every week?

06:36.787 --> 06:38.049
Beach Doctor.Yeah.

06:38.093 --> 06:39.486
Wow, you really are a fan.

06:39.529 --> 06:40.748
More importantly,
what was it like

06:40.791 --> 06:42.619
kissing Ryan Gosling
in that tornado movie?

06:42.663 --> 06:45.840
Mm.[clears throat]
Uh, Fallon, a word?

06:45.883 --> 06:48.103
Ah! Yeah, Jeff, this is...

06:48.146 --> 06:50.061
Wow. Janelle Crowley.

06:50.105 --> 06:51.541
Huge fan.

06:52.847 --> 06:54.762
Which I'm sure
you hear all the time.

06:54.805 --> 06:56.503
And yet it never gets old.

06:56.546 --> 06:58.330
So... thank you.

06:58.374 --> 06:59.680
Of course.

06:59.723 --> 07:02.987
Um, I was just about
to tell Janelle

07:03.031 --> 07:06.338
that our site managers
should be done relocating

07:06.382 --> 07:08.950
Patty's petroleum to an ethical
waste ground by end of day.

07:08.993 --> 07:10.908
An eco-friendly hallelujah
to that.

07:10.952 --> 07:12.997
Now, if you'll excuse me,

07:13.041 --> 07:14.564
I'm gonna use the ladies' room.

07:14.608 --> 07:16.784
Don't do anything exciting
till I come back.

07:16.827 --> 07:18.176
I won't. [chuckles]

07:21.745 --> 07:23.486
Hold that hallelujah.

07:23.530 --> 07:24.966
We got a problem with Morell.

07:25.009 --> 07:26.707
There's an issue
with securely

07:26.750 --> 07:28.883
disposing of the toxic waste
from the plant,

07:28.926 --> 07:30.406
a spill which resulted

07:30.450 --> 07:32.974
in some of it being
relocated into marshland.

07:33.017 --> 07:35.629
Oh, no, are those egrets?Yes.

07:35.672 --> 07:38.196
Well, if this leaks,
it'll be a PR nightmare for us.

07:38.240 --> 07:40.590
Yes.And tree-hugger Janelle Crowley

07:40.634 --> 07:42.244
will never sign on
to play yours truly.

07:42.287 --> 07:44.681
Seems likely.And Liam's movie will implode.

07:44.725 --> 07:46.030
Probably.

07:46.074 --> 07:48.511
Well, this is
a huge cluster duck.

07:48.555 --> 07:50.644
♪

07:56.476 --> 07:58.782
Apologies are for
incompetent people, Cynthia.

07:58.826 --> 08:00.915
Um...I want competence-- look it up.

08:00.958 --> 08:02.525
Yeah, but...And while you have
the dictionary open,

08:02.569 --> 08:03.961
maybe get acquainted
with the word "unemployed."

08:04.005 --> 08:06.486
But... but Ms. Co...Good morning.

08:06.529 --> 08:09.097
There is my knight
in cashmere armor.

08:09.140 --> 08:11.534
I thought you could use
some calming saffron tea.

08:11.578 --> 08:14.015
I know I seem stressed,
but Alexam's launch

08:14.058 --> 08:17.018
is only a few weeks away
and everything is a mess.

08:18.410 --> 08:20.412
Look, I get
why you're stressed.

08:20.456 --> 08:22.719
But I miss last week's Alexis.

08:22.763 --> 08:24.939
The one who was so carefree

08:24.982 --> 08:26.941
and relaxed
in our modest palace in Dubai.

08:26.984 --> 08:29.204
Well, I wasn't so carefree

08:29.247 --> 08:31.075
when that sandstorm hit
when we were

08:31.119 --> 08:33.077
experimenting
with the hot tub jets.

08:34.470 --> 08:36.428
How much of that call
did you hear?

08:36.472 --> 08:39.736
Enough to know that you weren't
particularly kind to Cynthia.

08:39.780 --> 08:41.825
I have a short fuse.

08:41.869 --> 08:43.914
I know it's a problem
if I'm going to get that

08:43.958 --> 08:45.612
flock of losers
to be productive.

08:45.655 --> 08:47.962
First step, maybe don't
call your employees losers.

08:48.005 --> 08:50.399
And second step,
maybe you can ask someone

08:50.442 --> 08:52.096
for advice on adjusting
your management style.

08:53.271 --> 08:55.709
How about you?
You manage a hedge fund.

08:55.752 --> 08:58.320
I was thinking of someone with
a similar temperament to yours.

08:58.363 --> 09:00.583
My fuse is long.

09:00.627 --> 09:02.498
Oh, don't I know it.

09:02.542 --> 09:03.760
[chuckles]

09:04.935 --> 09:06.284
JEFF:
The people who caused this spill

09:06.328 --> 09:08.286
were holdovers
from Patty's company.

09:08.330 --> 09:10.027
Maybe just own up to it.

09:10.071 --> 09:12.160
Sometimes the truth works.

09:12.203 --> 09:13.857
No one cares about the truth.

09:13.901 --> 09:15.511
They'll just write articles
saying Fallon Unlimited

09:15.555 --> 09:17.731
destroys the environment
and kills furry creatures.

09:17.774 --> 09:20.603
And then they'll show a picture
of a very sad, thin bird

09:20.647 --> 09:22.692
with a Sarah McLachlan
song playing.

09:22.736 --> 09:24.520
Our stock price will drop faster

09:24.564 --> 09:26.087
than Janelle drops out
of this movie.

09:26.130 --> 09:28.698
We need a swift
and secret clean-up

09:28.742 --> 09:31.353
of this mess,
coupled with a swift

09:31.396 --> 09:34.225
and secret firing of whoever
is responsible for this.

09:34.269 --> 09:35.618
Should we loop in your VP?

09:35.662 --> 09:37.359
Kelly? No, she's
home sick with the flu.

09:37.402 --> 09:38.795
Lucky bitch.

09:38.839 --> 09:40.275
Well, what about Janelle?

09:40.318 --> 09:41.885
If she's shadowing you,
she'll eventually

09:41.929 --> 09:44.279
want to know what's going on.

09:44.322 --> 09:46.411
Alexis is coming to visit.

09:46.455 --> 09:48.239
I will have her distract Janelle

09:48.283 --> 09:50.590
while you figure
this whole thing out.

09:50.633 --> 09:51.808
She cannot find out,
otherwise Liam will never

09:51.852 --> 09:53.201
trust me to help him again.

09:54.681 --> 09:56.596
CRISTAL: How do I look?

09:56.639 --> 09:59.337
Radiant, as always.

09:59.381 --> 10:00.687
I thought you said you were done

10:00.730 --> 10:01.992
wearing camel hair coats
for the season.

10:02.036 --> 10:03.951
I never said that.
Why would I...

10:05.343 --> 10:07.171
That must have been Rita.

10:07.215 --> 10:08.999
I should

10:09.043 --> 10:11.132
clear my head.
Today's a big day.

10:11.175 --> 10:13.264
Flores business?In a way.

10:14.526 --> 10:17.355
I'm attending the ELLE workshop
for female CEOs.

10:18.530 --> 10:21.446
It stands for Executive Ladies
Leadership Essentials.

10:23.231 --> 10:26.538
Well, it sounds a little
Ya-Ya Sisterhood for my taste.

10:26.582 --> 10:27.975
You should let me
help you.

10:28.018 --> 10:29.759
Leadership Essentials
is my middle name.

10:29.803 --> 10:32.240
Thanks, but Joyce Barry
is the best there is

10:32.283 --> 10:33.458
at this kind
of thing.

10:33.502 --> 10:34.938
And your CEO experience

10:34.982 --> 10:36.548
as a straight white male is

10:36.592 --> 10:37.941
probably a little different
from mine.

10:37.985 --> 10:40.248
I'm not so sure about that
these days.

10:40.291 --> 10:42.685
Maybe let's keep
the focus on me?

10:42.729 --> 10:44.252
The Flores board rejected

10:44.295 --> 10:45.993
my three-year
corporate expansion plan.

10:46.036 --> 10:47.429
I need to
find a way

10:47.472 --> 10:49.518
to tighten my grip
and get what I want.

10:49.561 --> 10:52.173
Maybe you should
partner with PPA.

10:53.174 --> 10:55.655
A high-profile,
new air freight contract

10:55.698 --> 10:58.266
that could sweeten your
expansion plan with the board.

10:58.309 --> 11:00.355
Getting my husband's help

11:00.398 --> 11:01.878
isn't the best way
to show the board

11:01.922 --> 11:03.924
how strong and independent I am.

11:03.967 --> 11:06.578
Well, fair enough.

11:06.622 --> 11:08.319
Are you sure
you don't need more time

11:08.363 --> 11:09.799
after what you've been through?

11:09.843 --> 11:11.192
Yes.

11:11.235 --> 11:13.716
I'm sure.
I've got this.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.370
ALEXIS:
No one knows

11:15.413 --> 11:17.938
what they're doing. So what
would you do in my position?

11:17.981 --> 11:19.766
Why don't you just do what
you used to do at the manor?

11:19.809 --> 11:21.289
Fire them and start fresh.

11:21.332 --> 11:22.725
Well, there's
no time for that.

11:22.769 --> 11:24.118
Plus I need
to learn to be nicer.

11:24.161 --> 11:25.597
[sighs]

11:25.641 --> 11:27.730
What's with the sushi spread,
and it's vegan?

11:27.774 --> 11:30.124
Is that even a thing?

11:30.167 --> 11:32.387
Only the best for my mother.JANELLE:
I guess I just wanted something

11:32.430 --> 11:33.910
that challenges me, you know?

11:33.954 --> 11:36.347
Is that Janelle Crowley?Mm-hmm.

11:36.391 --> 11:38.436
Wow, she really
looks older in person.

11:38.480 --> 11:40.395
You can keep that to yourself.

11:40.438 --> 11:42.223
Right now,
she is trying to decide

11:42.266 --> 11:44.747
if she wants
to play me in Liam's movie.

11:44.791 --> 11:47.054
And I really, really need you
to go over there

11:47.097 --> 11:49.970
and just regale her, you know,
with stories from my youth

11:50.013 --> 11:52.320
while I go handle
a private business matter.

11:52.363 --> 11:53.843
I came here for help,

11:53.887 --> 11:55.627
not to chitchat
with America's sweetheart.

11:55.671 --> 11:57.673
Okay, okay, fine.

11:57.717 --> 11:58.892
I know someone who can help you.

11:58.935 --> 12:00.110
I will set
it all up

12:00.154 --> 12:02.373
if you go talk to Janelle.

12:02.417 --> 12:04.636
Just keep it positive
and eco-friendly.

12:04.680 --> 12:06.421
Janelle?

12:06.464 --> 12:08.597
This is my mother.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.991
And she would be
more than happy

12:11.034 --> 12:13.036
to discuss all things Fallon

12:13.080 --> 12:14.908
Carrington with you,
so what do you say

12:14.951 --> 12:16.518
swap dance partners
for a little bit?

12:16.561 --> 12:18.825
I was actually thinking
we could all talk...

12:18.868 --> 12:20.870
We are going to have
a great chitchat.

12:20.914 --> 12:22.872
[chuckles]

12:22.916 --> 12:25.309
Uh, so...

12:25.353 --> 12:27.355
the clean-up's
gone well so far.

12:27.398 --> 12:28.965
Great. Who's
getting fired?

12:29.009 --> 12:31.098
A Patty hire named
Linda Bergeron.

12:31.141 --> 12:33.753
Lazy and wholly responsible
for the clean-up oversight.

12:33.796 --> 12:36.625
Good. Let's get rid of her.
We'll make her sign an NDA

12:36.668 --> 12:39.062
and then we can forget this
entire thing ever happened.

12:39.106 --> 12:41.369
ALEXIS:
You know, you would think
a daughter would tell her mother

12:41.412 --> 12:43.632
when she lost her virginity,
but I had to find out

12:43.675 --> 12:44.938
through the tabloids.

12:44.981 --> 12:47.201
Sushi's ready.

12:47.244 --> 12:49.290
AMANDA:
Well, that sounds
like great news to me.

12:49.333 --> 12:51.335
Well, in theory, yes.

12:51.379 --> 12:53.250
But if I mess up,
I might as well wash

12:53.294 --> 12:55.644
this shampoo commercial
right out of my life.

12:55.687 --> 12:57.167
And Charlie, as well.Well, I thought

12:57.211 --> 12:59.126
Charlie was excited about
giving you a second chance.

12:59.169 --> 13:00.910
Well, she was. She is.

13:00.954 --> 13:04.087
But as soon as she hears me try
to say "glycine soja extract,"

13:04.131 --> 13:06.176
she's gonna run for the hills,
which is sad,

13:06.220 --> 13:08.004
because I really think
we have potential.

13:08.048 --> 13:09.832
Oh, like, um...
[clears throat]

13:09.876 --> 13:11.834
like, professional potential?

13:11.878 --> 13:14.271
Or-or... romantic?

13:14.315 --> 13:16.578
Obviously professional, 100%.

13:17.492 --> 13:19.320
Or maybe, like, 80/20, you know?

13:19.363 --> 13:20.974
Depending on what she's wearing.

13:21.017 --> 13:23.280
She's really cute.
My mind wanders.

13:25.065 --> 13:26.109
What's that look for?

13:26.153 --> 13:28.111
Nothing, um, why don't you

13:28.155 --> 13:29.983
just tell Charlie
that you're feeling nervous?

13:30.026 --> 13:32.550
If she supports you,
then, uh, you know,

13:32.594 --> 13:34.378
she'll understand.
You know, I really

13:34.422 --> 13:36.032
have to get back
to this mock trial prep.

13:36.076 --> 13:37.555
Who are you mocking?

13:37.599 --> 13:39.253
Uh, it's a rehearsal

13:39.296 --> 13:40.950
where we find out what's
working and what's not working

13:40.994 --> 13:42.691
if this malpractice case
ever goes to trial.

13:42.734 --> 13:44.388
That's what I need.
[laughs]

13:44.432 --> 13:46.260
I need a mock commercial.

13:46.303 --> 13:48.088
You help me prep, I do

13:48.131 --> 13:49.916
a great job, and Charlie
never has to know

13:49.959 --> 13:52.222
I was struggling.
It's a win-win-win.

13:52.266 --> 13:55.095
Not entirely sure what
I'm winning in this situation.

13:55.138 --> 13:57.184
Oh, you get me--
I'll help you with the trial.

13:57.227 --> 14:00.230
Oh, so you're familiar
with Section 3971

14:00.274 --> 14:02.102
of the Official Code
of Georgia Annotated?

14:03.407 --> 14:05.670
I will be by tomorrow.

14:08.499 --> 14:11.894
Mrs. Carrington. Welcome.

14:11.938 --> 14:14.157
Joyce Barry,
it is such an honor.

14:14.201 --> 14:15.811
Let's see how you feel
after I run you

14:15.855 --> 14:17.247
through the wringer
for the next two days.

14:17.291 --> 14:19.728
I'm looking forward to it.[laughs]

14:19.771 --> 14:21.643
Are all these
women CEOs?

14:21.686 --> 14:24.211
Yep. But only one of you
will leave here

14:24.254 --> 14:27.344
with a year-long on-call
mentorship with yours truly.

14:27.388 --> 14:29.651
Amazing.
I have so much to learn.

14:29.694 --> 14:32.175
I just hope I can compete.

14:32.219 --> 14:34.612
Of course you can.
With the right attitude,

14:34.656 --> 14:36.310
nothing can stand in your way.

14:36.353 --> 14:39.182
Okay, I'm here,
we can start.

14:40.357 --> 14:44.231
Oh. I was looking
for the CEO seminar.

14:44.274 --> 14:47.538
Did you get lost on your way to
the Sloppy Second Wife's Club?

14:56.852 --> 15:00.029
If a woman
is strong and assertive,

15:00.073 --> 15:03.032
then she's too abrasive to lead.

15:03.076 --> 15:06.079
And if she's not assertive
enough, she's a pushover

15:06.122 --> 15:07.863
and she gets
no respect.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.386
You should be
familiar with that.

15:09.430 --> 15:10.953
And to be
good managers,

15:10.997 --> 15:12.955
you must learn to work
with different styles.

15:12.999 --> 15:15.958
You will get that chance
this weekend.

15:17.438 --> 15:20.049
Tomorrow, you will launch
a hot dog

15:20.093 --> 15:22.095
stand in the park,

15:22.138 --> 15:24.880
using a limited budget
of $1,000.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.969
How is this helpful?

15:27.013 --> 15:29.841
Hawking wieners
is a bit beneath me.

15:29.885 --> 15:32.453
Real world application
of my teachings

15:32.496 --> 15:34.368
will illuminate
your shortcomings.

15:34.411 --> 15:36.979
Then this should be
very helpful for Alexis.

15:37.023 --> 15:38.720
I have split
all of you up

15:38.763 --> 15:41.897
into teams of two, solely
based on when you enrolled.

15:43.116 --> 15:44.900
Oh, n... Anyone but her.I... Are you
sure about that?

15:44.944 --> 15:47.729
Sorry, ladies.
You were the last two.

15:47.772 --> 15:50.297
If you want to deal
with adversity and people

15:50.340 --> 15:52.952
you don't like, tomorrow will be
a great place to start.

15:56.172 --> 15:58.087
This is what you wanted
to talk to me about--

15:58.131 --> 15:59.784
my father looking in my bag?

15:59.828 --> 16:01.743
Well, I mean, it was suspicious.

16:01.786 --> 16:05.094
And when I called him on it,
he froze, no explanation.

16:05.138 --> 16:06.878
Blake, no offense,

16:06.922 --> 16:08.706
but you can be
a little intimidating.

16:08.750 --> 16:10.317
Why would I take
offense to that?

16:10.360 --> 16:12.754
Point is I'm sure
there's a good explanation.

16:12.797 --> 16:14.625
Sam, what do you even
know about the guy,

16:14.669 --> 16:16.888
huh? He just
shows up now?

16:16.932 --> 16:19.543
Where was he when you were
a drug-addict grifter?

16:19.587 --> 16:20.892
No offense.

16:20.936 --> 16:22.982
Why would I
take offense to that?

16:24.418 --> 16:27.116
I already did the suspicion
thing with him last week.

16:28.465 --> 16:30.424
He just wants to be my dad.

16:31.642 --> 16:33.035
Get to know me.

16:33.079 --> 16:35.429
Okay, well, maybe I need
to get to know him, too.

16:35.472 --> 16:37.605
We should all
go riding tomorrow.

16:37.648 --> 16:39.389
Like...

16:39.433 --> 16:40.695
horses?

16:40.738 --> 16:42.827
I'll take that as a yes.

16:42.871 --> 16:44.612
See you tomorrow.

16:44.655 --> 16:47.571
Okay.

16:57.668 --> 16:59.714
[phone chimes, vibrates]

17:06.808 --> 17:08.636
What do you think?

17:08.679 --> 17:10.420
Well, this isn't exactly
what I was expecting

17:10.464 --> 17:12.248
when I was summoned
up to the bedroom.

17:12.292 --> 17:13.771
How much would you spend
on one of these?

17:13.815 --> 17:15.686
Nothing. I prefer burgers.

17:15.730 --> 17:19.560
And what do hot dogs have to
do with female empowerment?

17:19.603 --> 17:21.518
I knew this seminar was
just a bunch of crap.

17:21.562 --> 17:23.477
Well, Joyce says
that leadership skills

17:23.520 --> 17:25.696
are the same whether you're
running a Fortune 500 company

17:25.740 --> 17:27.394
or a hot dog stand.

17:27.437 --> 17:29.439
Well, I guess
that almost makes sense.

17:29.483 --> 17:31.354
Problem is that
my partner is Alexis.

17:31.398 --> 17:33.182
Alexis?

17:33.226 --> 17:35.141
I thought you said
this was a prestigious program.

17:35.184 --> 17:36.446
How'd she slither her way in?

17:36.490 --> 17:38.100
Fallon made a call.[knocking]

17:38.144 --> 17:39.580
And if you're gonna
keep being critical,

17:39.623 --> 17:40.711
I'll just do this
somewhere else.

17:40.755 --> 17:42.800
I'm sorry, I'll stop.

17:43.758 --> 17:45.412
What's this?

17:45.455 --> 17:48.154
Your new nighttime regimen.
Just as you requested last week.

17:49.372 --> 17:51.635
The valerian tea helps
soothe your nerves, remember?

17:51.679 --> 17:53.333
Yes.

17:53.376 --> 17:55.291
I do now. Thank you.Of course.

17:57.554 --> 18:01.036
Rita really made herself
at home here, didn't she?

18:02.690 --> 18:04.431
Look, just so you know...

18:04.474 --> 18:06.650
Rita and I were never intimate.

18:06.694 --> 18:09.958
In case...Let's be done talking
about Rita, permanently.

18:10.001 --> 18:11.612
Okay.

18:13.875 --> 18:15.311
FALLON:
And I want the scissors

18:15.355 --> 18:18.488
to be big.
Like, "bigger than my arm" big.

18:18.532 --> 18:20.838
Okay, thank, you.Don't worry, I won't ask.

18:20.882 --> 18:23.667
I'm gonna tell you anyway.
Janelle loved shadowing me.

18:23.711 --> 18:25.582
And since I was able
to find a solution

18:25.626 --> 18:27.889
to a tiny problem, I was
thinking she could be the one

18:27.932 --> 18:30.587
to cut the ribbon
as we reopen Morell Green.

18:30.631 --> 18:31.893
Yeah, well, the only
thing Janelle's cutting

18:31.936 --> 18:34.243
is her ties
to the movie.

18:34.287 --> 18:35.505
She's out.

18:35.549 --> 18:37.116
What did you do?

18:37.159 --> 18:39.683
Me? I did nothing.
I was a perfect gentlewoman.

18:39.727 --> 18:41.816
What, did she hear

18:41.859 --> 18:43.818
about the toxic waste spill
and the oily egrets?

18:43.861 --> 18:45.385
Oily regrets?

18:45.428 --> 18:47.561
Small chemical spill,
precious marshlands,

18:47.604 --> 18:50.303
adorable birds--
not my fault.

18:50.346 --> 18:52.000
I have no idea what you're
talking about, but I guess

18:52.043 --> 18:53.697
a story broke last night

18:53.741 --> 18:55.830
that you fired a project manager

18:55.873 --> 18:57.571
at Morell named Linda

18:57.614 --> 18:59.834
because she wanted to spend
more time with her family.

18:59.877 --> 19:02.053
Are you freaking
kidding me? Wow.

19:02.097 --> 19:04.882
That lying snitch-- I bet
she doesn't even have a family.

19:04.926 --> 19:06.014
I'm guessing the truth
has something

19:06.057 --> 19:07.189
to do with the toxic waste?

19:07.233 --> 19:09.409
Yes, it does, but I couldn't

19:09.452 --> 19:11.237
tell Janelle the truth
because I wanted

19:11.280 --> 19:12.542
to protect the movie.

19:12.586 --> 19:14.196
I'm sorry, Liam.

19:14.240 --> 19:16.590
Oh, it's fine. Uh,

19:16.633 --> 19:18.374
but we should go. We got
a long day ahead of us

19:18.418 --> 19:20.855
scraping the bottom of the
barrel to find a replacement.

19:22.073 --> 19:23.597
MICHAEL:
You know if you don't

19:23.640 --> 19:25.816
fix this, there probably
won't be a movie.

19:25.860 --> 19:27.905
Well, I do now.

19:29.820 --> 19:32.258
Do you always drink
before a day's work?

19:32.301 --> 19:34.390
Bubbles soothe my stomach.

19:35.609 --> 19:37.654
Which is I what need,
because Cristal's plan

19:37.698 --> 19:40.222
for our project today
is making me ill.

19:40.266 --> 19:42.355
Hey, go easy on her, okay?
She's been through a lot.

19:42.398 --> 19:44.966
Oh, did she lose one of Blake's
apology necklaces?

19:45.009 --> 19:47.098
No, I'm talking
about her being

19:47.142 --> 19:49.753
kidnapped by her brother while
someone else impersonates her

19:49.797 --> 19:51.320
for a few weeks
without anyone noticing.

19:51.364 --> 19:52.974
But, sure, maybe
it's what you said, too.

19:53.017 --> 19:54.497
Are you serious?

19:54.541 --> 19:56.325
Oh, I couldn't make
that up if I tried.

19:56.369 --> 19:58.240
That is just the thing
I need to know

19:58.284 --> 20:00.460
before a day
of emotional warfare.

20:00.503 --> 20:02.940
That's exactly the opposite
reason why I told you.

20:02.984 --> 20:04.768
Yeah, I thought
you were trying

20:04.812 --> 20:06.683
to become a better
and nicer

20:06.727 --> 20:08.250
manager?

20:08.294 --> 20:09.904
Bullying your partner
seems off-base.

20:09.947 --> 20:11.601
Cristal is not my partner.

20:11.645 --> 20:14.082
Except she is.

20:14.125 --> 20:16.824
Maybe approach it as if
she were an Alexam employee,

20:16.867 --> 20:19.435
and try to work
on your patience.

20:19.479 --> 20:20.871
My employee?

20:20.915 --> 20:23.091
As if I would ever hire
that two-faced...

20:26.007 --> 20:27.530
Not like that, right.

20:27.574 --> 20:29.967
Okay. [clears throat]
I will try.

20:30.011 --> 20:33.275
But I'm not following
her stupid business plan.

20:33.319 --> 20:35.234
You don't have to.

20:35.277 --> 20:37.453
Just be professional
and respectful.

20:38.802 --> 20:40.674
They should sell tickets
to this.

20:42.066 --> 20:43.720
BLAKE:
Well, that was wonderful.

20:43.764 --> 20:45.505
It has been a while
since I've been on a horse.

20:45.548 --> 20:47.594
Daniel, you really have
a way with Allegra.

20:47.637 --> 20:49.248
Oh, thanks.
We've spent a lot of time

20:49.291 --> 20:50.814
together prepping
for the big race next week.

20:50.858 --> 20:52.555
Hey, Sam.

20:52.599 --> 20:54.209
Why don't you go get that Scotch
out of the tack room?

20:54.253 --> 20:56.167
It's not every day that
I get to bond with your father.

20:56.211 --> 20:58.300
Sounds great.

20:58.344 --> 21:00.563
Well, that's, uh,
very generous of you.

21:00.607 --> 21:03.305
You're not getting
a sip of that Scotch.

21:03.349 --> 21:05.786
You're not getting
a taste of Sam's money, either,

21:05.829 --> 21:07.266
which we both know
is the reason you're here.

21:07.309 --> 21:08.789
Excuse me?

21:08.832 --> 21:10.965
I did some digging.
You're broke.

21:11.008 --> 21:12.445
A success like Sam--

21:12.488 --> 21:14.011
that's an appetizing
meal ticket, isn't it?

21:14.055 --> 21:15.404
You know nothing about me.

21:15.448 --> 21:17.319
Look, I'm just trying
to protect Sam.

21:17.363 --> 21:19.495
And I can help you, too,
if you let me.

21:23.064 --> 21:25.371
That's five more zeroes
than your current balance.

21:25.414 --> 21:27.155
Just take it,
be grateful.

21:27.198 --> 21:28.243
And be on your way.

21:28.287 --> 21:29.940
[scoffs quietly]

21:29.984 --> 21:32.029
I'm grateful Sam's managed to...

21:32.073 --> 21:33.379
be a good person

21:33.422 --> 21:35.032
despite living with
a man like you.

21:35.076 --> 21:36.991
No thanks.Don't lay your hands on me.

21:37.034 --> 21:39.298
Don't make assumptions
about my intentions with my son.

21:39.341 --> 21:41.865
Hey, what the hell's
going on here?

21:50.178 --> 21:51.614
A man should be able to defend
himself on his own property,

21:51.658 --> 21:53.399
shouldn't he?So Daniel just attacked you

21:53.442 --> 21:55.096
for no reason?No, he had a reason.
He knows I'm onto him.

21:55.139 --> 21:56.619
You should've
seen his face

21:56.663 --> 21:58.447
when I caught him
snooping around your bedroom.

21:58.491 --> 22:00.275
I wasn't snooping. And what I
was doing is none your business.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.711
Oh, so you admit you
were doing something?

22:01.755 --> 22:04.279
No. I mean, yes,
but it's not what you think.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.760
What was it then? Because
right now I am wondering.

22:06.803 --> 22:09.153
Just admit it--
you're hiding something.

22:09.197 --> 22:11.068
Are you?

22:11.112 --> 22:13.419
Well, the truth is,
I was trying to hide something.

22:14.550 --> 22:16.857
A picture of me and your mother

22:16.900 --> 22:18.859
from when we were young.

22:18.902 --> 22:20.817
I thought it would be
a nice surprise for you to find,

22:20.861 --> 22:23.211
but... now I see
I shouldn't have bothered.

22:23.254 --> 22:25.561
Dad, I'm-I'm so sorry.

22:25.605 --> 22:27.650
Would you quit
calling this con man dad?

22:27.694 --> 22:29.304
He's right.

22:30.436 --> 22:32.916
At least until
you actually trust me.

22:35.441 --> 22:37.312
Yeah, great
detective work, Blake.

22:37.356 --> 22:38.879
Where was that

22:38.922 --> 22:42.273
keen eye when a stranger
was sleeping in your bed, huh?

22:42.317 --> 22:43.753
FALLON:
It's so beautiful

22:43.797 --> 22:45.668
I could almost cry.

22:45.712 --> 22:49.150
Our stock price is holding
steady. No leaks about the leak.

22:49.193 --> 22:51.326
There's just one thing
we should talk about.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.633
Oh, please don't tell me the
egrets have spoken to the press.

22:53.676 --> 22:55.069
The cleanup crew told me

22:55.112 --> 22:56.679
that the spill
didn't look accidental.

22:56.723 --> 22:58.594
There might've been foul play.

22:58.638 --> 23:00.640
I hope that's just
a bad bird pun.

23:00.683 --> 23:03.730
Yeah, it's not. Something
shady definitely went down.

23:03.773 --> 23:05.122
The initial report cited

23:05.166 --> 23:06.950
slick roads as the cause
of the accident,

23:06.994 --> 23:08.996
but there was hardly
any precipitation.

23:09.039 --> 23:10.519
Don't worry,
I'll get to the bottom of it.

23:10.563 --> 23:12.478
Thank you, because now

23:12.521 --> 23:15.698
I'm off to meet
little miss movie star.

23:15.742 --> 23:17.700
Again?Yep.

23:17.744 --> 23:20.050
["Workin' for a Livin'" by
Huey Lewis and the News playing]

23:20.094 --> 23:23.445
Achieve that natural... glow
that you've always wanted.

23:23.489 --> 23:25.316
Did you just hurt your neck
flipping your hair?

23:25.360 --> 23:26.970
Yeah, it really hurt.

23:27.014 --> 23:28.842
This time, less violently.

23:28.885 --> 23:30.757
Um...

23:30.800 --> 23:34.021
sexier?

23:34.064 --> 23:35.283
More serious.

23:35.326 --> 23:37.503
Okay, y-you're angry.[roars]

23:37.546 --> 23:39.766
Oh, um, okay, let's drop

23:39.809 --> 23:41.376
the animal and go, like, goofy.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.683
[laughing]

23:43.726 --> 23:45.685
Friendly and wholesome.

23:45.728 --> 23:48.078
Made with organic glycine
soju extract.

23:48.122 --> 23:51.473
Soja, soja... It's not,
like, a Korean liquor.Soja?

23:51.517 --> 23:53.867
Yeah.Okay. I'll try again.

23:53.910 --> 23:55.956
Made with orga...Oh, careful!

23:55.999 --> 23:57.218
[gasps]

23:57.261 --> 23:59.481
[panting]

24:01.004 --> 24:03.267
If I'm so nervous
to do this in front of you,

24:03.311 --> 24:05.008
how am I gonna to do this
in front of cameras

24:05.052 --> 24:06.575
and a crew and Charlie?

24:06.619 --> 24:08.795
It's normal to be nervous, okay?
When I'm in court,

24:08.838 --> 24:11.058
I'm like Xena the Warrior
outside.

24:11.101 --> 24:12.407
You know? On the
inside, my stomach

24:12.451 --> 24:14.191
probably looks
like a carnival on fire.

24:14.235 --> 24:15.497
But you're so confident.

24:15.541 --> 24:17.804
It's acting. Okay.

24:17.847 --> 24:20.589
[clears throat]

24:20.633 --> 24:23.897
No one wants their hair to be
dry and frizzy and lacking

24:23.940 --> 24:26.116
in sheen, do they?
Well, neither does my client.

24:26.160 --> 24:29.163
There is a reason
that every bottle

24:29.206 --> 24:31.470
has glycine soja extract in it.

24:31.513 --> 24:33.210
In fact, actually,
the only thing my client

24:33.254 --> 24:34.951
is guilty of is making your hair

24:34.995 --> 24:37.345
look more amazing than
it ever has before.

24:37.388 --> 24:39.478
If that's a crime...

24:39.521 --> 24:40.827
lock me up.

24:42.481 --> 24:44.134
Oh, thank you, thank you.

24:44.178 --> 24:45.527
[chuckles]

24:45.571 --> 24:47.790
Wow.You can do this.

24:47.834 --> 24:49.270
Yeah, I just need
to convince the judge

24:49.313 --> 24:50.880
and jury to buy shampoo.

24:50.924 --> 24:52.665
And if all else fails,
just think about

24:52.708 --> 24:55.406
the delicious meal you'll
reward yourself with after.

24:55.450 --> 24:57.191
Now, that I can do.

24:57.234 --> 24:58.671
I can already taste
the chicken parm

24:58.714 --> 25:00.934
I'm gonna eat.Not until you're done.

25:00.977 --> 25:03.893
Oh.

25:03.937 --> 25:06.635
Thank you so much
for helping me.

25:07.593 --> 25:09.246
FALLON:
Please,

25:09.290 --> 25:11.553
don't punish Liam for whatever
issues you have with me.

25:11.597 --> 25:13.990
It's not about
punishment or Liam.

25:14.034 --> 25:16.079
It's about ethical depiction,

25:16.123 --> 25:18.473
which is very important
to me as an artist.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.344
On Beach Doctor,

25:20.388 --> 25:21.824
I learned
how to do a tracheotomy.

25:21.868 --> 25:23.304
I could totally tell.

25:23.347 --> 25:24.958
And you can depict me
however you want.

25:25.001 --> 25:26.873
I can't. Liam's version of you

25:26.916 --> 25:29.397
is written through rose-colored
glasses and it always will be.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.355
And this reaction of yours--

25:31.399 --> 25:33.401
this is all because
of Linda getting fired?

25:33.444 --> 25:35.882
She didn't get fired.
You fired her.

25:35.925 --> 25:38.014
For wanting to spend time
with her family.

25:38.058 --> 25:39.929
Fallon, and by default,

25:39.973 --> 25:42.105
Farrah are not good people.

25:42.149 --> 25:44.064
And Farrah
needs to be as likable

25:44.107 --> 25:46.066
as the actress playing her.Well, I can't

25:46.109 --> 25:49.548
I can't give you the specifics,
for very specific reasons,

25:49.591 --> 25:53.116
but you have to trust me,
Linda's firing was justified.

25:53.160 --> 25:55.336
Oh, I'm sure you can justify it
in your head however you want,

25:55.379 --> 25:57.077
but why should I trust you?

25:57.120 --> 25:59.209
What, you're gonna believe
some trashy gossip site?

25:59.253 --> 26:00.602
I mean, Janelle, you know
better than anyone

26:00.646 --> 26:02.125
not to believe
everything you read.

26:02.169 --> 26:05.128
Did Tom Cruise really
bring that lion to set

26:05.172 --> 26:07.130
just so you could feed
it a vanilla milkshake?

26:07.174 --> 26:09.045
That was just
a ridiculous rumor.

26:09.089 --> 26:10.525
Okay, you see, there you go.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.440
I hate it when
I read things about people

26:12.483 --> 26:14.921
that aren't true. You can tell
me all the real stories later.

26:14.964 --> 26:16.575
There is no later.

26:16.618 --> 26:18.185
I have plenty of other offers
on the table,

26:18.228 --> 26:19.752
and I'd rather
take one of those.

26:19.795 --> 26:22.581
I like to be
the only selfish one on set.

26:22.624 --> 26:24.104
Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

26:24.147 --> 26:26.323
Just give me a chance
to show you who I am.

26:26.367 --> 26:28.195
I can't let Liam down.

26:29.849 --> 26:31.502
Please?

26:33.113 --> 26:35.724
Forget all of this.
I have a new plan.

26:35.768 --> 26:37.944
As usual,
you're not making any sense.

26:37.987 --> 26:39.815
Did you not look
at the specs I sent?

26:39.859 --> 26:42.122
I did. Hence, the new plan.

26:42.165 --> 26:43.645
We need
to make a splash.

26:43.689 --> 26:45.647
You weren't even
making a ripple.

26:45.691 --> 26:47.170
So I spent the entire budget

26:47.214 --> 26:48.694
on something that will
actually get us noticed.

26:51.044 --> 26:53.524
We can't afford all that
with our budget.

26:53.568 --> 26:55.483
I think the budget
is more of a suggestion.

26:55.526 --> 26:57.180
Joyce will appreciate

26:57.224 --> 26:59.139
our aggressiveness,
and the truth is it's my fault.

26:59.182 --> 27:01.707
I never should've had a beta
do an alpha's job.

27:01.750 --> 27:03.404
So I'm sorry.

27:03.447 --> 27:05.624
In case you missed it,
that's me being a bigger person.

27:05.667 --> 27:07.538
Now, get changed.

27:15.895 --> 27:17.548
BLAKE:
Is that lemon and cayenne--

27:17.592 --> 27:19.072
people still doing that?

27:19.115 --> 27:21.161
Yes, I'm cleansing.

27:21.204 --> 27:23.946
Trying to get rid of all
the negativity surrounding me.

27:23.990 --> 27:25.469
All right, listen, it goes

27:25.513 --> 27:27.080
without saying
that I owe you an apology.

27:27.123 --> 27:29.256
No, it deserves to be said.

27:29.299 --> 27:31.388
And I'm not sure I accept it.

27:31.432 --> 27:33.564
Just because
Rita fooled you

27:33.608 --> 27:35.958
doesn't mean you can go
and take it out on Daniel.

27:36.002 --> 27:39.440
Well, that's not actually the
reason I reacted the way I did.

27:40.833 --> 27:43.662
Seeing the two of you together,
I was jeal...

27:43.705 --> 27:45.402
Jell-O?

27:45.446 --> 27:47.187
Gel-caps?

27:47.230 --> 27:48.710
I was jealous.

27:48.754 --> 27:49.755
Why?

27:49.798 --> 27:51.495
Well, because I've...

27:51.539 --> 27:53.323
come to think
of myself as your father.

27:53.367 --> 27:55.238
You know, it's a title
I'm proud of.

27:55.282 --> 27:56.936
And it hurts to...

27:56.979 --> 27:59.155
know I could lose it
that easily.

28:00.853 --> 28:03.507
So...

28:03.551 --> 28:05.684
Here.What is that?

28:05.727 --> 28:08.208
That's just a little apology.

28:11.994 --> 28:14.431
Well, you, uh...

28:14.475 --> 28:16.216
certainly know
the way to my heart.

28:16.259 --> 28:18.000
And my wrist.

28:18.044 --> 28:19.610
[chuckles]

28:20.916 --> 28:22.918
I forgive you.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.922
And you will always be
a father to me,

28:26.966 --> 28:28.532
no matter how many

28:28.576 --> 28:31.361
biological daddies
come out of the woodwork.

28:31.405 --> 28:33.886
Well, hearing you say that's
a relief.

28:35.496 --> 28:37.890
Okay, this, uh,
touchy-feely stuff

28:37.933 --> 28:39.718
gives me the willies,
so I'm gonna go apologize

28:39.761 --> 28:41.415
to Daniel
and get that out of the way.

28:41.458 --> 28:43.330
Uh, actually,
if it's okay with you,

28:43.373 --> 28:44.897
I'd like to bring him dinner
after he's done

28:44.940 --> 28:46.812
training Allegra
and apologize to him first.

28:46.855 --> 28:49.771
You're not the only one
who questioned his motives.

28:58.214 --> 29:00.782
I told you no one would buy
a hot dog for $100.

29:00.826 --> 29:03.350
Oh, I want to say
that your attitude

29:03.393 --> 29:05.352
isn't helping,
but I am practicing kindness.

29:05.395 --> 29:07.789
However, if I wasn't, I would
tell you that you're lifeless

29:07.833 --> 29:09.748
and uninspired,
and that working with you

29:09.791 --> 29:11.575
is basically like working alone.

29:11.619 --> 29:13.229
Hello, ladies.

29:13.273 --> 29:16.189
Seems as though
business is slow.

29:16.232 --> 29:18.626
I think the weather
is keeping people away.

29:18.669 --> 29:21.281
Oh, you mean clear skies
and perfect temperature?

29:21.324 --> 29:23.065
I had nothing to do
with this insanity.

29:23.109 --> 29:24.588
She won't even listen to me.

29:24.632 --> 29:26.808
If you can't be heard or seen,

29:26.852 --> 29:29.680
it's because you're not making
your presence felt.

29:29.724 --> 29:31.857
And the only person
that can control that

29:31.900 --> 29:33.815
is you.

29:33.859 --> 29:35.643
Don't blame Alexis.

29:36.862 --> 29:39.647
What a wise woman.

29:43.912 --> 29:46.393
Hey, where are you going
with that wiener?

29:46.436 --> 29:49.222
I mean, I guess
it could've been my fault.

29:49.265 --> 29:50.832
I'm not really sure.

29:50.876 --> 29:52.834
Patty never had us
do any real work like that.

29:52.878 --> 29:54.227
You know, she was
a really good boss.

29:54.270 --> 29:55.837
Okay, Linda.

29:55.881 --> 29:58.622
Well, you're probably
wondering why you're here.

29:58.666 --> 30:00.755
Yeah, that is a good question.
[laughs]

30:00.799 --> 30:04.367
Since I am a
kind-hearted person...

30:05.760 --> 30:08.154
I'd like to...

30:08.197 --> 30:09.938
offer you your job back.

30:09.982 --> 30:11.810
I was wrong
to fire you.

30:11.853 --> 30:14.769
You seem like a really, uh...

30:14.813 --> 30:17.032
I mean, you seem like a...

30:17.946 --> 30:19.339
Well, you get the point.

30:19.382 --> 30:20.949
Listen, I'm sorry

30:20.993 --> 30:22.603
I had to play hardball
in the press

30:22.646 --> 30:25.824
like that, but I'm glad
it allowed you to see my value.

30:25.867 --> 30:27.956
Now should we talk numbers?

30:28.000 --> 30:29.566
Because I think
I deserve

30:29.610 --> 30:31.090
a pay increase
for the pain and suffering.

30:31.133 --> 30:33.440
You want to negotiate
a higher salary?

30:33.483 --> 30:36.269
It hasn't even been 24 hours.

30:40.577 --> 30:43.580
Yeah, sure, what were you, uh,
what were you thinking?

30:43.624 --> 30:45.844
40% raise and
a five-year contract.

30:45.887 --> 30:48.977
If things don't work out,
I want protections.

30:49.021 --> 30:51.240
For my family.

30:51.284 --> 30:53.808
Uh...

30:55.418 --> 30:58.160
Okay, you win.

30:58.204 --> 31:00.597
Welcome back.Great.

31:00.641 --> 31:03.992
Hold on, you brought me here
to watch you re-hire this woman?

31:04.036 --> 31:07.126
You were upset that I fired her.

31:07.169 --> 31:09.824
And so I hired her back.
What do you want from me, lady?

31:09.868 --> 31:11.739
I wanted to see the real Fallon.

31:11.782 --> 31:13.741
Which, now, I have.

31:13.784 --> 31:15.874
All right, you know
what, that's it.

31:15.917 --> 31:17.266
I give up.

31:17.310 --> 31:18.702
No, I...

31:18.746 --> 31:20.052
I meant that as a good thing.

31:20.095 --> 31:21.836
You were willing to sacrifice

31:21.880 --> 31:23.446
something
for the husband you love

31:23.490 --> 31:25.535
and re-hire
this incompetent woman.Hey.

31:25.579 --> 31:26.972
Oh, please.

31:27.015 --> 31:28.887
I'll accept the part,
with one caveat.

31:30.105 --> 31:33.456
You let me re-fire Linda
as you, in character.

31:34.631 --> 31:37.330
Yeah, sure, fine, go for it.

31:41.421 --> 31:44.206
Linda, you're done here.

31:44.250 --> 31:46.121
You have 30 minutes to pack up
your sad little office

31:46.165 --> 31:48.080
or I'll do it for you.

31:48.123 --> 31:50.256
And when I say I'll do it,
I'll toss it in the garbage.

31:50.299 --> 31:52.823
I would've given her ten, but...

31:52.867 --> 31:55.174
Wait, is this for real?BOTH: Get out.

31:58.177 --> 32:00.135
CHARLIE:
How you feeling?

32:00.179 --> 32:02.137
Prepared,
confident,

32:02.181 --> 32:03.878
and incredibly hungry.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.401
How do I look?

32:05.445 --> 32:06.750
Gorgeous.

32:06.794 --> 32:09.318
And my hair--
can it sell shampoo?

32:09.362 --> 32:10.972
I'd buy an entire crate of it.

32:12.408 --> 32:14.149
You really are something, Kirby.

32:14.193 --> 32:16.108
I'm glad we met.

32:19.502 --> 32:22.549
If this goes well,
do you want to...

32:22.592 --> 32:25.117
get a drink later
or maybe see a movie?

32:26.161 --> 32:28.120
Kirby, I'm so sorry if
I gave you the wrong impression,

32:28.163 --> 32:29.817
but I don't date my clients.

32:29.860 --> 32:32.124
Oh.

32:32.167 --> 32:34.126
Right, of course not.

32:34.169 --> 32:35.692
'Cause that would be crazy.

32:35.736 --> 32:37.303
It's just a rule I have.

32:37.346 --> 32:38.913
Mm-hmm.I hope you understand.

32:38.957 --> 32:41.568
Oh, yeah.Anyway, I don't want
to distract you,

32:41.611 --> 32:43.657
so I'll go watch
from the monitor.Okay.

32:43.700 --> 32:45.528
Good luck.Thanks.

32:45.572 --> 32:47.008
Ooh.

32:47.052 --> 32:49.663
High five.
[chuckles]

32:50.881 --> 32:52.666
Are you ready to break a leg?

32:52.709 --> 32:54.320
Yes, actually, both of them.

32:54.363 --> 32:55.886
As soon as I jump out
the nearest window.

32:55.930 --> 32:56.931
What happened?

32:56.975 --> 32:58.063
Apparently I'm as bad at reading

32:58.106 --> 32:59.586
body language
as I am performing it.

32:59.629 --> 33:02.545
Because I just asked out
my agent and she rejected me.

33:02.589 --> 33:04.983
Which makes sense. We have
to go. I-I can't do this.

33:05.026 --> 33:06.375
Wait, no, no, no,
sorry, wait, one thing

33:06.419 --> 33:08.247
has nothing to do
with the other, okay?

33:08.290 --> 33:11.250
you just need to turn down
the self-doubt, drama mama.

33:11.293 --> 33:14.514
You just got to convince
a jury to buy shampoo.

33:14.557 --> 33:17.821
Think about the chicken parm
if all else fails.

33:17.865 --> 33:19.301
Hey.

33:19.345 --> 33:20.737
You got this.

33:22.435 --> 33:24.089
You look, um...

33:24.132 --> 33:25.438
gorgeous.

33:25.481 --> 33:27.396
Charlie said the same thing.

33:27.440 --> 33:30.704
But don't worry, I won't
ask you out as well. [chuckles]

33:30.747 --> 33:32.793
[chuckles]

33:34.142 --> 33:36.014
High-class hot dog? It's golden.

33:36.057 --> 33:37.667
Just taste it.

33:37.711 --> 33:39.365
Fine, keep jogging.

33:39.408 --> 33:42.237
I'm sure you're late
for a Jazzercise class.

33:43.412 --> 33:45.980
Where have you been?
We need to be selling hot dogs.

33:46.024 --> 33:47.764
We are.

33:47.808 --> 33:49.940
I used the fire-starter
technique Joyce taught us.

33:49.984 --> 33:52.987
I met a nice man named Ron who
works at a law firm close by.

33:53.031 --> 33:55.903
I sacrificed a sale
for good exposure.

33:55.946 --> 33:57.905
You gave him a free hot dog?

33:57.948 --> 34:00.038
Yes, and he happened to love

34:00.081 --> 34:02.692
your Wagyu beef thing,
golden flakes and all.

34:02.736 --> 34:06.131
He told his colleagues, who
are now all on their way here.

34:06.174 --> 34:08.046
It's about time
you made yourself useful.

34:08.089 --> 34:10.091
[phone chimes]

34:11.092 --> 34:12.311
What is it?

34:12.354 --> 34:13.573
It's a text from Ron.

34:13.616 --> 34:14.922
They're not coming.

34:14.965 --> 34:16.663
What? Why not?

34:16.706 --> 34:18.795
All it says is "Violently ill.

34:18.839 --> 34:21.624
No one is coming.
What did you feed me?"

34:21.668 --> 34:23.713
Of course you gave the hot dog

34:23.757 --> 34:26.064
to a lawyer with a weak stomach.
We are so getting sued.

34:26.107 --> 34:29.371
Did you even check to see if
these golden flakes are edible?

34:30.807 --> 34:33.027
Do I have to do everything?

34:33.071 --> 34:34.898
Seriously?

34:34.942 --> 34:37.075
That's it,
I can't do this anymore.

34:37.118 --> 34:38.511
Well neither can I.

34:38.554 --> 34:40.513
You make it impossible
to be nice.

34:40.556 --> 34:43.429
You're a waste of space.
You might as well not be here.

34:43.472 --> 34:46.171
No wonder your husband didn't
even notice you were gone.

34:48.347 --> 34:50.871
[gasps]

34:50.914 --> 34:52.568
[grunts]

34:55.745 --> 34:57.747
Why couldn't you stay
home and be a doormat?

34:57.791 --> 34:59.227
It's your only skill.

34:59.271 --> 35:01.838
Oh, yeah? Would a doormat...

35:02.622 --> 35:04.406
...do this?

35:05.320 --> 35:08.715
JOYCE:
Put the condiments down!

35:10.760 --> 35:12.936
You're both out of the program.That's fine.

35:12.980 --> 35:14.460
I think I got what I needed.

35:17.593 --> 35:18.594
[Alexis gasps]

35:25.340 --> 35:27.516
I'm just trying
to be seen and heard.

35:31.999 --> 35:36.090
Mind if I join you?Sure.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.961
How did I do today?
Be honest.

35:38.005 --> 35:39.224
The client could not be happier,

35:39.267 --> 35:40.660
and I could not be
more impressed.

35:40.703 --> 35:42.749
Seriously? I
thought for sure

35:42.792 --> 35:43.576
I blew it and that
they were already

35:43.619 --> 35:44.925
calling Sasha to replace me.

35:44.968 --> 35:47.188
No way. You've got
a career as a slasher.

35:47.232 --> 35:48.363
Huh?

35:48.407 --> 35:49.669
Actor-slash-model.

35:49.712 --> 35:51.105
Oh!
[laughs]

35:51.149 --> 35:52.367
What are you gonna do
to celebrate?

35:52.411 --> 35:54.761
I am gonna get
some chicken parm.

35:54.804 --> 35:57.633
Okay, that's very specific.

35:57.677 --> 36:00.245
But it sounds tasty.
Can I come with?

36:00.288 --> 36:03.073
Sure.

36:03.117 --> 36:05.511
Just a, uh, platonic

36:05.554 --> 36:08.383
hearty Italian dinner.
[laughs]

36:08.427 --> 36:10.820
I'm really sorry
for asking you out before.

36:10.864 --> 36:12.213
I guess I just wasn't thinking,

36:12.257 --> 36:13.910
which is kind of a problem
for me.

36:13.954 --> 36:17.479
I kind of act before
I think and then...

36:20.265 --> 36:21.744
Kind of like that?

36:21.788 --> 36:24.312
Either you really

36:24.356 --> 36:27.924
like breaded chicken cutlets,
or I'm confused.

36:27.968 --> 36:30.579
I thought you had a policy
against dating clients.

36:30.623 --> 36:32.755
But does that not include
spontaneous kissing?

36:32.799 --> 36:35.062
I've been interested in you
from the moment we met.

36:35.105 --> 36:37.934
But I've had disasters
in the past.

36:37.978 --> 36:39.762
Models can be delicate
and insecure.

36:39.806 --> 36:41.416
But the way you killed it today

36:41.460 --> 36:43.113
made me realize you have got
plenty of confidence.

36:43.157 --> 36:45.812
I did? I do?

36:45.855 --> 36:48.118
Oh, yeah. It was pretty hot.

36:48.162 --> 36:51.165
Well, you
know, I try.

36:53.385 --> 36:55.213
God willing,
that's the last time

36:55.256 --> 36:57.780
I will be at a park for... ever.

36:57.824 --> 36:59.782
I'm sensing ELLE was a bust.

36:59.826 --> 37:01.610
I tried to be professional
with Cristal.

37:01.654 --> 37:03.264
But it just didn't stick.

37:03.308 --> 37:05.310
And she squirted ketchup
all over my fabulous gown.

37:05.353 --> 37:08.226
Maybe I just
don't do partnerships.

37:08.269 --> 37:10.097
Friendly reminder

37:10.140 --> 37:12.099
that you already have a partner.

37:12.142 --> 37:13.622
Adam? Well, that's different.

37:13.666 --> 37:14.928
I basically own him.

37:14.971 --> 37:16.495
Touching.

37:16.538 --> 37:18.801
So you got nothing at all
from this?

37:18.845 --> 37:20.412
Not nothing.

37:20.455 --> 37:22.414
I learned that
I can't change who I am.

37:22.457 --> 37:24.546
Not even
for world-renowned

37:24.590 --> 37:27.332
Joyce Barry.
I'm bad-tempered,

37:27.375 --> 37:29.725
I don't sugarcoat things,

37:29.769 --> 37:32.641
and I am not the nicest manager
when I'm stressed.

37:32.685 --> 37:34.513
And...

37:34.556 --> 37:36.558
I feel that me being

37:36.602 --> 37:39.431
a bitch at times
is a problem for you.

37:40.736 --> 37:43.609
Which may be a problem for us.

37:43.652 --> 37:46.089
What? Alexis, no.

37:46.133 --> 37:48.178
I mean...

37:48.222 --> 37:50.355
maybe if I were working for you
it would be.

37:50.398 --> 37:53.967
Then why were you pushing
for me to change so much?

37:54.010 --> 37:56.317
It just seems
like you were trying

37:56.361 --> 37:58.450
a backdoor approach
to changing my personality.

37:58.493 --> 38:00.234
Not at all.

38:00.278 --> 38:01.975
I love your personality.

38:02.018 --> 38:03.759
I just want you to have

38:03.803 --> 38:05.718
everything you want.

38:05.761 --> 38:08.503
And it seemed like a good way
to assure Alexam's success.

38:08.547 --> 38:10.810
But...

38:10.853 --> 38:13.856
with regard to your
private personality--

38:13.900 --> 38:16.163
don't change

38:16.206 --> 38:17.382
a thing.

38:18.774 --> 38:20.950
I think you're the perfect

38:20.994 --> 38:22.256
amount of bitch.

38:22.300 --> 38:24.302
[laughs]

38:25.781 --> 38:28.654
How do you always know
the right thing to say?

38:28.697 --> 38:30.786
Hello, handsome.

38:30.830 --> 38:32.875
Well...

38:32.919 --> 38:35.443
I'm guessing the ELLE conference
was a rousing success?

38:35.487 --> 38:37.532
More like a total disaster.

38:37.576 --> 38:39.752
Aw. I know you were pinning
a lot on Joyce, but...

38:39.795 --> 38:42.015
Turns out I didn't need Joyce.

38:42.058 --> 38:44.887
What I do need
is to talk about Rita.

38:46.411 --> 38:48.500
Me and Rita, not you and Rita.

38:48.543 --> 38:50.328
I know

38:50.371 --> 38:52.330
I said I didn't,
but I haven't been honest

38:52.373 --> 38:54.767
about how it made me
feel about myself.

38:54.810 --> 38:57.726
The Flores board had me worried.

38:57.770 --> 38:59.815
How could I possibly
be a powerful CEO

38:59.859 --> 39:01.600
when I couldn't even
make a mark on my family?

39:01.643 --> 39:03.558
Oh, honey, of course you've
made a mark on this family.

39:03.602 --> 39:05.647
I know that now.

39:05.691 --> 39:08.520
But I allowed Rita
to make me doubt myself.

39:08.563 --> 39:10.348
Until today.

39:10.391 --> 39:11.871
So it was a success.

39:11.914 --> 39:14.700
In a different way.

39:14.743 --> 39:17.964
During a ridiculous fight
with Alexis,

39:18.007 --> 39:19.879
I remembered.

39:19.922 --> 39:21.620
I'm Cristal Carrington.

39:21.663 --> 39:23.752
And there's only one of me.

39:23.796 --> 39:26.059
I am liking this energy.

39:26.102 --> 39:28.757
Then you would've loved
hearing me

39:28.801 --> 39:32.108
call the board to push through
my expansion plan.

39:32.152 --> 39:33.980
Which I can do.

39:34.023 --> 39:36.243
As CEO.Hmm.

39:36.286 --> 39:37.940
One more thing.

39:37.984 --> 39:40.247
I don't think PPA and Flores
should work together.

39:40.290 --> 39:42.641
Yeah, I know that.
You've made that very clear.

39:42.684 --> 39:45.078
This is a proposal

39:45.121 --> 39:47.820
to merge PPA and Flores
into one entity.

39:47.863 --> 39:49.778
It's a natural fit
for both companies.

39:49.822 --> 39:51.824
You know, it's a big decision.

39:51.867 --> 39:53.434
I know.

39:53.478 --> 39:55.349
I've crunched every number
there is to crunch.

39:56.655 --> 39:58.657
But you can sleep on it.

39:59.745 --> 40:01.442
Well, I don't need
to sleep on it.

40:01.486 --> 40:03.575
Something tells me

40:03.618 --> 40:05.664
we're not sleeping
very much tonight.

40:07.013 --> 40:08.449
Let's merge.Hmm.

40:08.493 --> 40:10.408
Don't mind if I do.

40:10.451 --> 40:11.887
JEFF:
Good news is

40:11.931 --> 40:13.367
Morell is now
squeaky clean,

40:13.411 --> 40:15.978
super green, and the
spill site is spotless.

40:16.022 --> 40:17.676
But...

40:17.719 --> 40:20.156
But I was right
about the accident.

40:20.200 --> 40:22.202
It was intentional.

40:22.245 --> 40:24.596
And you're not gonna be
happy when you find out who

40:24.639 --> 40:26.728
gave Linda her instructions.Oh, no.

40:26.772 --> 40:28.948
Was it... Liam?

40:28.991 --> 40:30.602
Okay, it's not that bad.

40:30.645 --> 40:32.604
It was Kelly, your VP,

40:32.647 --> 40:34.344
who is supposedly home sick.

40:34.388 --> 40:37.260
I hired a P.I. to tail Linda
after she was fired.

40:37.304 --> 40:38.914
Followed her right
to a meeting with Kelly.

40:38.958 --> 40:40.394
Why would she do that to me?

40:40.438 --> 40:42.048
I have no idea.

40:42.091 --> 40:44.180
But you should probably find out
sooner rather than later.

40:44.224 --> 40:48.228
Well, thank you for all
of your hard work on this, Jeff.

40:48.271 --> 40:49.403
Cousin power.

40:49.447 --> 40:51.492
Cousin power, yeah.Yeah.

40:51.536 --> 40:54.060
Didn't know that was a thing,
but I like it.

40:54.103 --> 40:56.236
[laughs]

40:57.324 --> 40:59.500
How did you get Janelle back?

40:59.544 --> 41:01.328
Well, I could tell you
the details,

41:01.371 --> 41:03.199
but it's probably best
that I don't.

41:03.243 --> 41:05.114
You know what,
you are probably right.

41:05.158 --> 41:06.855
But thank you.

41:06.899 --> 41:08.596
I know that I've been playing
it cool, but this project

41:08.640 --> 41:09.989
means way more to me
than I let on.

41:10.032 --> 41:11.512
I know it does.

41:11.556 --> 41:12.992
And you don't need to be afraid

41:13.035 --> 41:14.384
to admit stuff like that to me.

41:14.428 --> 41:16.169
Okay?
I am here for you,

41:16.212 --> 41:18.301
100%, whatever you set
your sights on.

41:18.345 --> 41:21.479
Well, right now,
my sights are set on going home

41:21.522 --> 41:24.090
and getting back
to some baby-making.

41:24.133 --> 41:26.962
Ah, sounds like the perfect
distraction from work.

41:27.006 --> 41:29.225
Hmm, maybe that could be
the title of my next book:

41:29.269 --> 41:31.837
The Perfect Distraction.

41:31.880 --> 41:33.926
[laughs]

41:41.673 --> 41:43.718
[Daniel grunts,
inhales deeply]

41:48.506 --> 41:49.507
[exhales]
