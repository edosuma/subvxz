WEBVTT

00:09.790 --> 00:13.308
Mudslide kills 600 religious pilgrims,

00:14.594 --> 00:18.153
and yet both my ex-wives live on...

00:23.924 --> 00:25.253
Morning.

00:25.981 --> 00:27.250
Morning.

00:29.138 --> 00:33.914
Not again, please not again...
Oh, thank God.

00:36.735 --> 00:39.307
Always in the last place you look, uh?

00:40.624 --> 00:41.924
Have a nice day!

00:43.524 --> 00:44.724
You too.

00:48.203 --> 00:49.580
Yeah Phil, it's Charlie.

00:49.585 --> 00:52.701
Put me down for a grand on Detroit tonight.
What's the lineup?

00:53.499 --> 00:54.889
Well, excuse me...

00:55.213 --> 00:59.711
But don't you think if the gambler is awake
it'd be who is the bookie to be up as well?

01:00.423 --> 01:03.392
Alright, well call me
when you get off the can.

01:04.302 --> 01:07.435
Are you aware that your sleep-over
buddy was packing heat?

01:07.438 --> 01:08.435
Oh yeah...

01:08.451 --> 01:11.622
Any hotter and she'd have
burnt my pubes clean off!

01:11.723 --> 01:13.937
Charlie, a gun in a house...

01:13.962 --> 01:15.820
Relax, she's a cop.

01:15.812 --> 01:17.478
Or was a cop...

01:17.492 --> 01:19.878
Or is wanted by the cops.

01:20.968 --> 01:23.134
I know she mentioned cops.

01:23.153 --> 01:26.061
Unbelievable,
so this was another one-night stand?

01:26.376 --> 01:28.797
Unless she comes back
for her handcuffs, yeah.

01:29.593 --> 01:32.256
Boy, how much satisfaction
can you get from that?

01:33.077 --> 01:35.542
Handcuffs? Never really my thing.

01:35.565 --> 01:37.252
But hey, she probably did
some stuff last night

01:37.253 --> 01:39.568
that might not have been her first choice...

01:40.603 --> 01:44.317
No, I mean how can you possibly get
any satisfaction from an endless series

01:44.318 --> 01:47.057
of alcohol-soaked one night stands, and even
as the words are coming out of my mouth

01:47.072 --> 01:50.446
I realize this is a stupid question
so forget I said it.

01:51.709 --> 01:54.102
She's married to a cop!

01:55.342 --> 01:56.988
I hate to see you wasting your life,

01:57.003 --> 01:59.793
having drunken sex with women
you don't care about.

02:00.006 --> 02:02.163
Who asked you to move
back in and watch?

02:03.301 --> 02:05.723
- You know who's good for you?
- Don't go there Alan.

02:05.739 --> 02:06.434
Mia.

02:06.775 --> 02:09.183
She was beautiful, she was smart,
she got you to clean up your act.

02:09.187 --> 02:10.454
I'm telling you Charlie,

02:10.604 --> 02:12.878
letting her go was the stupidest
thing you've ever done.

02:12.879 --> 02:14.310
You're going there Alan...

02:14.480 --> 02:17.880
I'm just saying you had this fantastic
woman who was willing to marry you,

02:17.881 --> 02:20.195
and then you just threw it away,
and for what?

02:20.196 --> 02:22.872
OK, you're there!

02:23.820 --> 02:27.017
You want to know why I gave up Mia?
I'll tell you why I gave up Mia,

02:27.091 --> 02:29.857
- I gave her up for you.
- Oh oh, for me?

02:29.985 --> 02:31.330
Yeah, yeah, for you!

02:31.386 --> 02:33.860
She wanted you to move out so
we would have the house to ourselves,

02:33.861 --> 02:37.919
but I said "nooo way, I am not
throwing my brother out on the street".

02:41.943 --> 02:45.143
- What a loving gesture.
- Oh bite me!

02:46.755 --> 02:50.319
And you know what you did?
You married Kandi and moved out anyway.

02:50.320 --> 02:53.569
So if you want to know why I let the best
thing that ever happened to me get away,

02:53.570 --> 02:57.570
it's so the worst thing that could ever
happen to me would have a place to live.

03:05.155 --> 03:07.732
I guessed it all worked out
for the best, huh?

03:07.736 --> 03:09.313
How do you figure?

03:09.515 --> 03:10.458
Think about it:

03:10.622 --> 03:14.322
if Mia had been living here when Kandi
kicked me out and I came back,

03:14.323 --> 03:16.973
it would have been
a very awkward situation.

Phil... Phil, you're my bookie,
not my psychiatrist.

03:51.986 --> 03:55.261
If I want to bet every single game in
the country with money I don't have,

03:55.262 --> 03:56.916
that's my business.

03:59.638 --> 04:01.322
Thank you, now...

04:01.496 --> 04:02.837
let's talk boxing.

04:04.262 --> 04:05.016
Really?

04:05.494 --> 04:07.378
There's no fights anywhere tonight?

04:08.265 --> 04:11.214
OK, well...
how are you and your wife getting along?

04:12.682 --> 04:16.238
What, it'd be a fair fight,
she's got like 50 pounds on you!

04:18.589 --> 04:19.889
Hello...

04:21.015 --> 04:25.015
My luck, I gotta have a bookie who is afraid
to fight out of his weight class.

04:25.992 --> 04:29.559
Aren't you a little worried that all this
betting might be turning into a problem?

04:29.560 --> 04:33.064
Alan, if you don't bet big
you can't cover your losses.

04:33.079 --> 04:36.738
And if you can't cover your losses,
a large man with a tire iron

04:36.751 --> 04:38.806
puts your address in the map-quest,
at which point

04:38.819 --> 04:42.057
you have to sneak across the Mexican
border dressed in woman's clothing.

04:44.319 --> 04:46.749
Now that's when you have a problem. 

04:47.443 --> 04:48.809
You know best.

04:48.887 --> 04:50.974
You're hungry?
I made your favorite sandwich.

04:51.361 --> 04:54.141
Turkey, ham and pastrami.

04:54.156 --> 04:56.643
Gobble, oink, mooooo.

04:58.786 --> 05:00.141
No, thanks.

05:00.153 --> 05:02.225
OK, how about something sweet?

05:02.239 --> 05:04.599
Key lime pie, yummy yummy! 

05:04.890 --> 05:07.984
Look, Alan,
I appreciate your sucking up.

05:08.006 --> 05:11.216
But you can't fill the gaping
wound in my heart with...

05:11.230 --> 05:12.660
Deli meat.

05:13.701 --> 05:15.048
And pie.

05:17.122 --> 05:18.520
Yummy.

05:19.233 --> 05:20.814
Can we just leave it alone?

05:21.030 --> 05:25.527
Can we not grind on and on about
the stupidest thing I've ever done?

05:25.748 --> 05:27.231
OK, I'm sorry I said that,

05:27.235 --> 05:30.499
giving up Mia was not
the stupidest thing you've ever done.

05:30.787 --> 05:33.752
It certainly wasn't as stupid as when you
came back from Rio with that gorgeous model,

05:33.760 --> 05:37.527
you know, the one with the Adam's apple
and the really big hands?

05:40.214 --> 05:42.748
You know, I'm gonna give you some space.

05:43.446 --> 05:45.503
Maybe go for a nice drive...

05:50.615 --> 05:52.274
Forgot my keys...

05:55.267 --> 05:57.867
You know what, they must have
slipped out of my pocket, and... 

05:57.878 --> 06:00.357
into the couch.

06:00.949 --> 06:02.550
Excuse me.

06:07.091 --> 06:08.150
Sorry...

06:13.310 --> 06:14.818
Found some change!

06:15.783 --> 06:16.929
Look...

06:18.270 --> 06:21.093
Is that a quarter in your ear?

06:33.709 --> 06:35.209
Very impressive...

06:51.492 --> 06:52.463
What is that?

06:52.733 --> 06:56.039
Steven Tyler rented the house next door.

06:57.034 --> 06:58.831
The guy from Aerosmith?

06:59.038 --> 07:01.068
I lost my virginity to him.

07:01.877 --> 07:03.641
You know, his music.

07:04.294 --> 07:06.123
Thanks, I was confused...

07:10.654 --> 07:12.931
He's apparently
getting ready for a tour.

07:12.992 --> 07:14.664
So what's...

07:19.162 --> 07:20.583
in the box?

07:21.198 --> 07:23.532
I went out and picked you up
a little something I thought might

07:23.535 --> 07:25.096
put a smile on your face.

07:26.304 --> 07:30.253
Alan, the only thing in this box that
could possibly put a smiling on my face,

07:30.254 --> 07:31.764
is your severed head.

07:35.542 --> 07:37.702
Good one. Zing!

07:39.370 --> 07:41.149
Come on, open it!

07:46.173 --> 07:48.381
- A hat!?
- A very expensive hat.

07:48.387 --> 07:50.155
Since when do I wear hats?

07:50.170 --> 07:53.181
Well, you don't but I saw it
and it seemed so...

07:53.181 --> 07:55.920
you. You know, cool, rakish...

07:55.934 --> 07:57.936
yet forgiving.

07:58.413 --> 08:02.338
- OK fine, I forgive you.
- Thanks! Thanks...

08:03.325 --> 08:04.544
Aren't you gonna try it on?

08:04.545 --> 08:05.837
No.

08:07.656 --> 08:09.998
If you really forgave me,
you'd try it on.

08:13.589 --> 08:14.880
Oh yeah!

08:15.132 --> 08:16.053
That is you.

08:16.063 --> 08:18.954
Let's try tilting it a little bit here.

08:19.121 --> 08:20.604
Oh baby!

08:20.672 --> 08:23.568
You gotta see this,
come on inside, we'll take a look.

08:24.912 --> 08:26.356
Charlie, you're coming?

08:33.318 --> 08:34.793
What's going on?

08:34.902 --> 08:36.489
You should leave, Alan.

08:37.063 --> 08:38.203
Why?

08:38.207 --> 08:39.659
Just trust me.

08:40.655 --> 08:41.981
Alright.

09:02.792 --> 09:05.368
Hey Tyler, take a pause for the cause!

09:05.376 --> 09:07.219
Oh sorry man...

09:07.979 --> 09:10.032
Thank you and goodnight!

09:14.812 --> 09:16.107
Hi Charlie.

09:16.311 --> 09:17.415
Rose.

09:17.425 --> 09:20.821
How cool is it that
Steven Tyler moved in next door?

09:22.621 --> 09:24.868
I lost my virginity to him.

09:25.300 --> 09:26.583
You mean his music?

09:26.600 --> 09:27.591
No.

09:30.370 --> 09:31.733
Nice hat.

09:31.734 --> 09:32.642
Thanks.

09:33.103 --> 09:34.496
Boy, you look like hell.

09:34.501 --> 09:35.649
That's strange.

09:35.661 --> 09:37.970
'Cause I feel like crap.

09:38.176 --> 09:40.619
How long do you think
you can keep it up?

09:43.654 --> 09:45.566
What exactly are we talking about?

09:45.947 --> 09:50.177
The excessive drinking, the obsessive
partying, the compulsive gambling.

09:51.490 --> 09:52.574
Hard to say.

09:52.582 --> 09:54.970
Trying to take it
one day at a time.

09:55.848 --> 09:59.848
You do realize this is all just an
attempt to avoid feeling your feelings?

09:59.878 --> 10:01.917
Let me tell you something about feelings.

10:02.008 --> 10:04.149
Feelings are like your mother's breasts.

10:04.264 --> 10:07.755
You know where they are,
but they're best left unfelt.

10:07.995 --> 10:10.320
It's an interesting analogy
but may I point out

10:10.332 --> 10:13.304
that the mother's breasts are
a source of nourishment and comfort.

10:13.305 --> 10:18.257
Yeah, well my mother's breasts were
a source of silicone and Russian vodka.

10:19.007 --> 10:22.607
Not good for child wearing,
but she was a big hit at parties.

10:23.567 --> 10:26.140
Charlie, I know how much it hurt you
to give up Mia,

10:26.540 --> 10:28.617
and I know you don't like that feeling,

10:28.628 --> 10:30.911
but the more you try to get rid of it,

10:30.917 --> 10:34.781
the more it's going to come back.

10:36.609 --> 10:39.392
Oh yeah... Perfect fit.

10:39.666 --> 10:41.850
It's like somebody measured your head
while you were asleep,

10:41.851 --> 10:45.056
so when your brother called,
she could tell him the size.

10:52.706 --> 10:55.913
Hey Uncle Charlie,
guess where I'm finally growing hair?

10:58.395 --> 11:00.633
Come on man, I'm eating.

11:00.639 --> 11:03.053
Right here, I'm growing a 'stache.

11:05.044 --> 11:06.747
Oh yeah, look at that...

11:08.440 --> 11:10.736
Hey, cool hat!
Whose is it?

11:12.341 --> 11:13.473
Yours.

11:14.573 --> 11:16.125
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:16.132 --> 11:18.248
It looks great with the 'stache.

11:20.127 --> 11:21.814
You know, it just occurred to me

11:21.816 --> 11:24.359
that I've been feeling guilty because
you called off your wedding to Mia

11:24.374 --> 11:25.722
so I wouldn't have to move out.

11:25.759 --> 11:28.990
But then, when I did move out,
you didn't call her!

11:29.005 --> 11:30.167
Yeah, so?

11:30.171 --> 11:32.405
So, you know why I think
you didn't call her?

11:32.409 --> 11:33.644
You didn't call her because the whole

11:33.648 --> 11:35.650
"I don't want to throw my brother
out on the street" business,

11:35.660 --> 11:38.759
is was a very convenient and
noble excuse to get out of the marriage.

11:38.772 --> 11:40.107
That's what you think, huh?

11:40.109 --> 11:42.512
- Yes, that's what I think.
- That's what you think?

11:42.516 --> 11:43.751
You heard me, that's what I think!

11:43.760 --> 11:45.212
Yeah, well...

11:45.584 --> 11:46.962
think again.

11:47.875 --> 11:52.105
Admit it Charlie, I've been beating myself up
buying you pie and hats for nothing.

11:53.262 --> 11:55.059
There's pie?

11:59.412 --> 12:02.904
There was, Berta ate it.
And why is he wearing your hat?

12:02.906 --> 12:03.955
I gave it to him.

12:03.958 --> 12:06.230
I bought this hat for you.

12:06.764 --> 12:09.150
And I gave it to Jake.

12:09.148 --> 12:11.004
You can't commit to anything, can you?

12:11.022 --> 12:13.820
- It's just a hat!
- It's not just a hat, it's a symbol!

12:13.823 --> 12:15.343
- Of what?!
- Of...

12:16.479 --> 12:18.403
OK, it's just a hat. But...

12:18.406 --> 12:22.494
the point is, you have nobody to blame for
your miserable lonely existence but yourself!

12:22.497 --> 12:24.740
And you can drink, gamble
and hump all you want,

12:24.745 --> 12:26.903
but one day,
you're gonna have to face that fact.

12:26.910 --> 12:29.025
Drink, gamble and hump!

12:31.835 --> 12:35.020
Yeah well, I don't have to face anything
I don't want to face,

12:35.021 --> 12:37.290
and I don't have to feel
anything I don't want to feel,

12:37.293 --> 12:39.876
and that includes Mom's vodka knockers.

12:41.698 --> 12:44.796
Who is this Vod Kanockers
that you speak of?

12:48.028 --> 12:49.454
Eat your dinner.

12:50.215 --> 12:52.482
The name's Kanockers.

12:52.757 --> 12:54.776
Vod Kanockers.

13:10.403 --> 13:11.504
Charlie?

13:13.708 --> 13:15.012
Are you OK?

13:15.018 --> 13:16.560
Just dandy...

13:17.578 --> 13:19.836
Could you close the blinds?

13:20.570 --> 13:23.055
Come on, let's get you inside...

13:24.142 --> 13:26.088
Looks like you had a tough night!

13:26.199 --> 13:28.672
No, the night was great.

13:28.853 --> 13:31.069
It's the morning that's killing me.

13:33.382 --> 13:34.615
Hey Alan...

13:34.749 --> 13:35.678
What?

13:36.377 --> 13:37.667
You were right.

13:38.284 --> 13:40.651
I can't keep running away
from my feelings...

13:41.343 --> 13:43.136
I'm glad you realized that.

13:43.144 --> 13:44.978
You're a wonderful brother,

13:46.159 --> 13:47.490
and this

13:47.651 --> 13:50.069
is a beautiful hat.

13:52.498 --> 13:53.874
Thank you.

14:01.923 --> 14:03.317
Charlie, you're OK?

14:03.445 --> 14:04.782
I'm fine.

14:05.152 --> 14:07.094
The hat's not so good.

14:17.999 --> 14:20.542
Hey, Berta,
want to see my armpit hair?

14:21.794 --> 14:24.314
Only if you want to see mine...

14:27.053 --> 14:28.491
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:32.054 --> 14:33.981
You know that's my juice...

14:34.518 --> 14:35.490
I know.

14:35.772 --> 14:37.241
You could at least ask...

14:37.376 --> 14:39.165
You could at least pay a rent.

14:40.703 --> 14:42.264
Touché...

14:46.783 --> 14:49.787
If that's a bookie or a woman
you know what to say.

14:49.930 --> 14:51.772
Harper residence.

14:52.065 --> 14:53.927
Sorry, he's dead.

14:55.646 --> 14:56.827
Interesting.

14:56.928 --> 15:00.549
No one ever calls back
to find out where to send flowers.

15:01.215 --> 15:02.932
Touché...

15:04.335 --> 15:08.126
How does it feel to go a whole week
without booze, broads or betting?

15:08.337 --> 15:10.555
It's actually kind of a relief...

15:10.563 --> 15:13.992
I never realized how much effort it took
to avoid feeling anything.

15:14.003 --> 15:15.987
Yeah? What are you feeling now?

15:16.002 --> 15:18.987
So far, mostly nausea and boredom.

15:19.100 --> 15:20.753
Touché...

15:21.756 --> 15:23.510
You don't know what that means, do you?

15:23.665 --> 15:24.937
Not a clue.

15:26.096 --> 15:26.933
Hey,

15:26.947 --> 15:29.580
if girls with big boobs
work at Hooters,

15:29.586 --> 15:32.196
where do girls with
only one leg work at?

15:34.713 --> 15:36.298
IHOP!

15:46.319 --> 15:48.068
That's just cruel.

15:49.073 --> 15:51.413
Actually, it's kinda funny.

15:51.761 --> 15:55.478
Yeah! 'Cause they got one leg,
they have to hop!

15:56.317 --> 15:57.743
I hop!

15:59.068 --> 16:02.437
Tipping your waitress
takes on a whole new meaning.

16:04.708 --> 16:06.922
It's not that funny.

16:07.048 --> 16:08.630
I know.

16:08.712 --> 16:10.838
Why are you laughing so much?

16:10.843 --> 16:12.783
I don't know!

16:13.769 --> 16:17.354
Dad!?
Something's wrong with Uncle Charlie!

16:17.726 --> 16:18.716
What's going on?

16:18.722 --> 16:24.153
Hey Jake, tell your Dad,
how one legged girls work at IHOP.

16:27.380 --> 16:28.699
Oh no.

16:28.734 --> 16:30.375
I gave away the joke.

16:32.093 --> 16:33.967
I'm so sorry Jake.

16:35.807 --> 16:37.981
I've ruined everything...

16:39.964 --> 16:41.520
Is he OK?

16:41.550 --> 16:44.467
He's fine, his feelings are
coming at the surface.

16:44.492 --> 16:46.916
Oh, like when Mom gets PMS.

16:48.084 --> 16:49.513
Well, kinda...

16:49.649 --> 16:52.673
Hang on, Uncle Charlie,
I'll get you some chocolate.

16:58.633 --> 17:00.285
What's he making out there?

17:00.544 --> 17:02.013
A lanyard...

17:02.636 --> 17:06.603
He's got a lot of free time now,
so I gave him one of Jake's old hobby-kits.

17:06.694 --> 17:09.126
You know, so he'd have something to do...

17:09.290 --> 17:14.012
I'm surprised he's not making a vagina
out of macaroni and bottle caps.

17:16.369 --> 17:22.748
Around, around the block,
and then downtown...

17:28.326 --> 17:36.465
Over, over, loop, around,
around the block, and then...

17:36.476 --> 17:40.048
Yo dude! Some of us
are trying to do crafts here!

17:40.070 --> 17:41.534
What!?

17:41.626 --> 17:44.126
Can you lay off the harmonica playing?

17:44.137 --> 17:47.801
Hey, a lot of people pay
to see me play harmonica.

17:47.813 --> 17:49.746
They pay to hear you sing,

17:49.758 --> 17:52.204
they tolerate the harmonica!

17:52.579 --> 17:55.700
Sorry I don't measure up
to your musical standards, you...

17:55.701 --> 17:57.371
lame-ass jingle writer!

17:57.377 --> 17:59.766
Alright, let's see how you play
harmonica your other end!

17:59.769 --> 18:02.174
No no no no, slow down here!
Come on...

18:02.198 --> 18:04.778
Let's see what you got,
jingle balls!

18:04.786 --> 18:07.860
OK, I'm gonna rip off your big fat lips,
and use them to kiss my ass!

18:07.874 --> 18:09.310
Charlie! Please, please...

18:09.315 --> 18:11.039
You know your emotions are
a little bit frayed right now...

18:11.054 --> 18:12.645
Right! Right, OK...

18:12.785 --> 18:13.866
OK.

18:15.102 --> 18:16.409
I'm better.

18:17.927 --> 18:18.655
That's it!

18:18.665 --> 18:21.891
No, Charlie, Charlie! Wait!
Charlie, don't do this!

18:21.898 --> 18:24.447
Come on Tyler,
you want a piece of me?!

18:27.210 --> 18:29.055
Well the dude may look like a lady,

18:29.066 --> 18:31.574
but you fight like a little girl.

18:33.968 --> 18:36.587
Did it ever occur to you
to help me out?

18:36.827 --> 18:37.647
Yeah, but

18:37.665 --> 18:41.119
once you were cowering under his
picnic table I figured the worst was over.

18:41.710 --> 18:44.916
Oh, good thinking squirting
that bottle of sunblock at him.

18:45.300 --> 18:48.514
I was hoping it would get
in his eyes and blind him.

18:48.524 --> 18:48.970
Yeah well,

18:48.982 --> 18:53.286
all you did was keep him from getting a
nasty burn while he beat the crap out of you.

18:53.284 --> 18:55.482
Please Alan, I'm begging you...

18:55.485 --> 18:56.499
OK.

18:56.826 --> 18:58.424
It's not right to
kick a man when he's down.

18:58.430 --> 18:59.457
Thanks.

19:01.961 --> 19:05.198
Too bad Steven Tyler
didn't feel that way, huh?

19:09.403 --> 19:11.099
You were right about Mia,

19:12.019 --> 19:16.926
I got cold feet, so I used you
as an excuse to call off the wedding.

19:20.356 --> 19:24.764
I am so proud of you Charlie,
this is a real breakthrough.

19:25.035 --> 19:28.581
Doesn't it feel liberating to finally
hear yourself admit the truth?

19:28.618 --> 19:30.268
Well I feel something...

19:31.288 --> 19:35.960
But since I'm also hearing a high pitch
whistle, it might just be a concussion.

19:44.744 --> 19:46.005
What are you making?

19:46.102 --> 19:48.354
A needlepoint sampler.

19:48.963 --> 19:50.178
No kidding?

19:50.398 --> 19:52.211
I find it very calming.

19:52.424 --> 19:55.375
And the message helps centering.

19:55.665 --> 19:57.919
God bless Vicoden?

19:58.658 --> 20:00.458
Pretty good, huh?

20:00.968 --> 20:03.027
You spelled Vicodin wrong.

20:06.025 --> 20:07.887
That's the great thing about Vicodin,

20:08.176 --> 20:09.539
I don't care.

20:11.615 --> 20:13.403
Hey, is Charlie here?

20:22.564 --> 20:23.598
Huh...

20:23.791 --> 20:25.942
Who may I say is calling?

20:27.236 --> 20:28.644
It's OK, Alan.

20:28.647 --> 20:32.078
- Hey Chazz, thanks for the gift.
- You're welcome.

20:32.120 --> 20:33.525
So no hard feelings?

20:33.538 --> 20:35.089
Nah... You?

20:35.147 --> 20:36.708
Why would I have hard feelings,

20:36.886 --> 20:40.376
I'm still picking pieces of
your ass out of my boot.

20:42.029 --> 20:43.304
Good one!

20:44.434 --> 20:46.910
OK well, good luck with the Tour.

20:46.920 --> 20:48.276
Thanks a lot man.

20:48.753 --> 20:49.850
Who is the sponsor?

20:49.856 --> 20:51.643
Metamucil?

20:52.213 --> 20:53.587
What was that?

20:53.597 --> 20:55.142
Nothing, nothing...

20:59.567 --> 21:00.984
I just want to say,

21:01.197 --> 21:02.357
I'm a huge fan.

21:02.657 --> 21:04.085
I lost my virginity to you.

21:04.089 --> 21:05.298
Really ?

21:05.317 --> 21:06.705
Well, you know, there's...

21:06.704 --> 21:09.334
a lot of the seventies I don't remember.

21:18.181 --> 21:19.999
Isn't that the hat I got you?

21:20.013 --> 21:20.989
Yeah.

21:20.992 --> 21:23.050
The hat you threw up in?

21:23.851 --> 21:25.178
I had it cleaned,

21:25.179 --> 21:25.877
but...

21:25.886 --> 21:28.424
I'll always know...
