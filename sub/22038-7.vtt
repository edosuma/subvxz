00:22.930 --> 00:25.220
(crickets chirping)
(country music playing)

00:26.100 --> 00:27.470
Welcome back to the story

00:27.470 --> 00:30.100
of country music's
most famous outlaw,

00:30.100 --> 00:31.430
Waylon Jennings,

00:31.430 --> 00:34.020
the man in the black hat.

00:58.810 --> 00:59.930
Mike:
He was an enigma.

00:59.930 --> 01:02.140
He counted among
his closest friends

01:02.140 --> 01:05.020
Willie Nelson,
the Hell's Angels,

01:05.020 --> 01:07.810
Muhammad Ali,
and Caroll Spinney,

01:07.810 --> 01:09.770
that guy who played Big Bird.

01:09.770 --> 01:12.430
He loved kids and old folks...

01:12.430 --> 01:16.180
and cocaine, lots of cocaine.

01:16.180 --> 01:18.470
(theme music playing)

01:31.180 --> 01:32.640
When I first met Waylon,

01:32.640 --> 01:34.770
he was kind of in a transition.

01:34.770 --> 01:37.680
He was, like,
a good-looking guy,

01:37.680 --> 01:39.350
like Gary Cooper or somebody,

01:39.350 --> 01:42.560
wearing them, uh,
camel coats and things.

01:42.560 --> 01:45.770
Pretty sharp,
but the wild side
of him come out.

01:45.770 --> 01:47.600
Mike:
Billy Joe Shaver's career

01:47.600 --> 01:50.350
will forever be linked
with Waylon Jennings.

01:50.350 --> 01:52.770
The singer-songwriter
started running with Waylon

01:52.770 --> 01:54.350
at the turning point
of his life,

01:54.350 --> 01:57.680
when he became an outlaw
in their home state of Texas.

01:57.680 --> 02:01.220
Waylon had an old school bus
that he had painted black,

02:01.220 --> 02:04.430
all the windows and everything,
with a paintbrush.

02:04.430 --> 02:08.140
And he kept dynamite
back there in the back,
just in case.

02:08.140 --> 02:10.180
I recall this one place
that we went.

02:10.180 --> 02:13.560
It was like a barn.
It was kind of
out in the field.

02:13.560 --> 02:14.850
Waylon was playing it,

02:14.850 --> 02:16.430
and they were hanging
from the rafters.

02:16.430 --> 02:19.180
I'm telling you,
it was just...
it was packed.

02:19.180 --> 02:22.980
And it come time to get paid,
and so we waited and waited,

02:22.980 --> 02:24.560
and Waylon's having a fit.

02:24.560 --> 02:27.060
(engine starts)
Then all of a sudden,
everybody started leaving

02:27.060 --> 02:29.470
'cause they knew
trouble was brewing.

02:29.470 --> 02:32.890
And everybody left.
Wasn't nobody in the place.

02:32.890 --> 02:34.930
It was just empty.

02:34.930 --> 02:38.140
And Waylon said, "You know,
we've waited long enough."

02:38.140 --> 02:40.060
so we get back in the bus,

02:40.060 --> 02:42.310
and we split and went right
across the field--

02:42.310 --> 02:44.980
bump, bump, bump,
that old bus.  (chuckles)

02:44.980 --> 02:46.730
When we finally got
to the pavement,

02:46.730 --> 02:50.560
all of a sudden,
the whole ass end
of that club blew up.

02:50.560 --> 02:53.060
(explosion)

02:53.060 --> 02:55.770
I don't know how he'd made sure
everybody was out or what.

02:55.770 --> 02:58.180
If there was a possum in there,
I imagine he went flying.

02:58.180 --> 03:00.020
I said, "Waylon,
did you see that?"

03:00.020 --> 03:03.180
And Waylon said,
"I ain't seen a thing.
I ain't seen nothing."

03:03.180 --> 03:04.430
That was about the time

03:04.430 --> 03:05.600
that he stopped doing pills

03:05.600 --> 03:06.730
and everything like that,

03:06.730 --> 03:09.270
and it was a different energy.

03:09.270 --> 03:13.430
Mike: Drummer Richie Albright
had been with Waylon
from the beginning,

03:13.430 --> 03:14.850
of the music and the drugs.

03:14.850 --> 03:19.020
They started playing together
in Phoenix in 1961.

03:19.020 --> 03:21.270
The pills started in Arizona.

03:21.270 --> 03:24.560
On the road, you know,
it's almost a necessity,

03:24.560 --> 03:26.600
but Waylon got
so sick on pills,

03:26.600 --> 03:29.680
and I could see
where it was really
hurting his health,

03:29.680 --> 03:31.890
so I introduced him to coke.

03:31.890 --> 03:32.980
(snorting)

03:34.180 --> 03:37.310
Mm, and the demon took over.

03:37.310 --> 03:39.520
Mike:
It was 1973,

03:39.520 --> 03:42.520
right around the time
Waylon got fed up
with Nashville

03:42.520 --> 03:44.520
and donned the black hat.

03:44.520 --> 03:46.520
Waylon made us all wear black--

03:46.520 --> 03:47.930
wear all black clothes,

03:47.930 --> 03:49.390
and we came on the stage

03:49.390 --> 03:51.020
looking like a Texas car club.

03:51.020 --> 03:54.140
Mike:
Billy Ray Reynolds was
a heavy equipment operator

03:54.140 --> 03:57.310
from Mississippi
who moonlighted
on rhythm guitar

03:57.310 --> 03:59.430
and joined the band
after sitting in one night.

03:59.430 --> 04:04.220
We were playing one
of Willie Nelson's festivals
down in Texas.

04:04.220 --> 04:07.140
It was Dripping Springs,
and then they called it
something else.

04:07.140 --> 04:09.350
And Billy Joe was there,
and Waylon heard this song

04:09.350 --> 04:11.810
that Billy Joe did called
"Willie the Wandering Gypsy."

04:11.810 --> 04:14.560
Waylon, he says,
"I'll do a whole album
of them cowboy songs

04:14.560 --> 04:16.350
if you'll bring 'em
up there to Nashville."

04:16.350 --> 04:19.020
And at that time,
he was kinda like me,

04:19.020 --> 04:20.890
pretty much cowboy,
you know.

04:20.890 --> 04:24.890
He was a real sincere,
real honest guy.

04:24.890 --> 04:27.100
And I went back
to Nashville,

04:27.100 --> 04:30.310
because he told me
he was gonna do the album.

04:30.310 --> 04:33.350
But he didn't--
He never showed up.

04:33.350 --> 04:35.220
Billy Joe was
a little impatient,

04:35.220 --> 04:37.850
and he wanted to know
when the hell they was
gonna cut his songs.

04:37.850 --> 04:41.350
Mike: Shaver finally
tracked him down
at RCA Studios,

04:41.350 --> 04:43.140
with the help
of Captain Midnight,

04:43.140 --> 04:46.350
the radio DJ
who had become
Waylon's confidant.

04:46.350 --> 04:48.390
Roger Schutt was
his real name,

04:48.390 --> 04:50.770
but Captain Midnight,
his radio name.

04:50.770 --> 04:54.100
And I went into the studio
where he was recording

04:54.100 --> 04:56.730
'cause Captain Midnight
got me in there.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.890
And I guess
somehow or another,

04:58.890 --> 05:01.140
Waylon got wind
that I was there.

05:01.140 --> 05:03.020
So Waylon said,
"They're good songs,

05:03.020 --> 05:05.730
but this guy's
driving me crazy."

05:05.730 --> 05:08.930
Waylon comes out.
He said, "What the hell
do you want, Hoss?"

05:08.930 --> 05:13.980
I said, "Look, Waylon,
if you don't at least
listen to these songs,

05:13.980 --> 05:16.930
"I'm gonna whip your ass
right here in front of God
and everybody.

05:16.930 --> 05:18.390
And I will do it."

05:18.390 --> 05:21.310
And I didn't know
if he was gonna take
a punch at me or what.

05:21.310 --> 05:24.060
He grabbed me by the arm,
which I let him do.

05:24.060 --> 05:26.180
He says, uh, "Let's go
in this room here."

05:26.180 --> 05:28.810
We went in the room,
and he said, "I'm gonna do
something with you."

05:28.810 --> 05:30.560
He said,
"I've never done
this before,

05:30.560 --> 05:32.890
"but I'm gonna let you play
one of your songs

05:32.890 --> 05:35.470
"out of that batch
you claim you got.

05:35.470 --> 05:38.850
"If I like it,
I'll let you play another.

05:38.850 --> 05:40.810
"If I like that,
I'll let you play another,

05:40.810 --> 05:43.810
"but if I get to a point
where I don't like 'em...

05:43.810 --> 05:47.270
you're gonna leave,
and I ain't never gonna
see you again."

05:47.270 --> 05:49.560
I said, "Hell,
that's fair enough."

05:49.560 --> 05:52.020
I did about six
of them cowboy songs.

05:52.020 --> 05:53.770
When I got
to "Honky Tonk Heroes,"

05:53.770 --> 05:57.350
he actually slapped his leg,
and he said, "Damn it."

05:57.350 --> 05:59.520
He said,
I know what I gotta do."

It's fair to say

06:17.350 --> 06:19.390
changed the game
in Nashville.

06:19.390 --> 06:22.930
It marks the moment
that the artists started
to take control.

06:22.930 --> 06:24.770
When we first started
working with him,

06:24.770 --> 06:26.100
that was like right after

06:26.100 --> 06:28.180
Honky Tonk Heroes  came out.

06:28.180 --> 06:29.930
He was bigger than life.

06:29.930 --> 06:33.270
Mike:
Barney and Carter Robertson
started touring with Waylon

06:33.270 --> 06:35.810
after working with his wife,
Jessi Colter,

06:35.810 --> 06:38.180
a country music star
in her own right.

06:38.180 --> 06:41.430
Barney on keys,
Carter singing harmonies.

06:41.430 --> 06:45.100
Jessi just had "I'm Not Lisa,"
which is a gigantic hit.

and be in the band,
and then started working
with Waylon as well.

07:01.060 --> 07:03.520
We're a package deal.
(chuckles)

07:03.520 --> 07:06.180
When Waylon first
hired you, he would say,

07:06.180 --> 07:08.350
"If you can
understand Jessi

07:08.350 --> 07:10.270
"and you can explain

07:11.930 --> 07:16.020
He would be so ornery
to her sometimes.
Oh my gosh.

07:16.020 --> 07:19.270

07:43.560 --> 07:46.730
Mike:
Waylon actually produced
his wife's second album

07:46.730 --> 07:49.220
in the studio that
would become his home.

07:49.220 --> 07:50.980
They called it
Hillbilly Central.

07:50.980 --> 07:53.060
It was just an old house.
Ron: Right.

07:53.060 --> 07:54.640
Kyle:
You know,
a big old house.

07:54.640 --> 07:55.730
Uh, it's still there.

07:55.730 --> 07:57.560
Mike:
Producer Ron Haffkine

07:57.560 --> 07:59.270
and sound engineer
Kyle Lehning

07:59.270 --> 08:01.850
spent a lot of time with Waylon
at Hillbilly Central

08:01.850 --> 08:04.890
during the heyday
of the outlaw country
music scene.

08:04.890 --> 08:07.060
You could discuss
anything with Waylon.

08:07.060 --> 08:08.560
I mean, whether
it was philosophy,

08:08.560 --> 08:09.640
whether it was music,

08:09.640 --> 08:10.930
whether it was politics.

08:10.930 --> 08:13.220
Shel Silverstein said
to me, one day, he said,

08:13.220 --> 08:17.980
"You know,
Waylon is not necessarily
formally educated,

08:17.980 --> 08:20.390
but he's got a very
sophisticated mind."

08:20.390 --> 08:23.180
And at the same time,
he was a real country dude.

08:23.180 --> 08:26.310
Came up poor, you know,
but he was self-taught.

08:26.310 --> 08:28.350
He did a lot of reading
as I remember.

08:28.350 --> 08:29.730
I don't know.
You don't know.

08:29.730 --> 08:31.560
I didn't see
a lot of books around.
Used to know.

08:31.560 --> 08:32.770
(both laugh)

08:32.770 --> 08:34.600
No, I saw some knives
and some guns...
Some guns, yeah.

08:34.600 --> 08:37.520
...but I didn't see
a lot of books.
(laughs, mutters)

08:37.520 --> 08:38.810
Kyle:
There were guns, knives,

08:38.810 --> 08:41.850
booze, cocaine, pot.
Ron:
Cocaine, right.

08:41.850 --> 08:44.020
It was a really nice
combination

08:44.020 --> 08:47.100
of disasters waiting
to converge.
(laughing)

08:47.100 --> 08:51.100
Mike: The studio
was owned by Waylon's
closest friend at the time,

08:51.100 --> 08:55.140
a guy named Tompall Glaser,
one of the Glaser brothers.

08:55.140 --> 08:57.560
Tompall, Chuck,
and Jim Glaser,

08:57.560 --> 09:02.060
they won the Arthur
Godfrey Talent contest
back in the '50s.

09:02.060 --> 09:04.350
They were farm boys
from Nebraska.

09:04.350 --> 09:06.060
Tompall was probably

09:06.060 --> 09:08.470
the unsung hero,

09:08.470 --> 09:10.560
because he was the one guy
who was a success.

09:10.560 --> 09:13.890
He'd had a very successful
publishing house and a studio.

09:13.890 --> 09:15.680
And he was a big shot
on Music Row,

09:15.680 --> 09:19.100
and he burned every bridge
he had to join the outlaws.

09:19.100 --> 09:21.310
Mike:
Singer-songwriter
Kinky Friedman

09:21.310 --> 09:25.140
also rode the outlaw wave,
recording at Hillbilly Central.

09:25.140 --> 09:27.470
Tompall opened up
his studio to Waylon

09:27.470 --> 09:30.560
and any crazy guy that
was spouting music lyrics

09:30.560 --> 09:32.640
that had different ideas.

09:32.640 --> 09:35.640
And the sessions
rolled all night long,

09:35.640 --> 09:39.810
and they weren't done
like the other studios
operated on Music Row.

09:39.810 --> 09:42.640
Waylon's office
was downstairs,

09:42.640 --> 09:44.730
and two, three o'clock
in the morning

09:44.730 --> 09:46.470
and that place
would be rocking.

09:46.470 --> 09:50.100
I mean, Waylon would be
up and playing their
own records.

09:50.100 --> 09:52.270
You could hear it
five miles away.

09:52.270 --> 09:54.180
There was a back room
that he had,

09:54.180 --> 09:58.140
and he claimed
that Hank Williams had
hung out there and slept there.

09:58.140 --> 10:00.560
Waylon says, "Come on, Billy,
I want to show you something."

10:00.560 --> 10:03.600
And he takes these boards
and moves 'em around,

10:03.600 --> 10:05.520
and there's this dynamite.

10:05.520 --> 10:08.350
He took his finger,
went down it, and went...

10:08.350 --> 10:10.220
(pops)
Pow!  (laughs)

10:10.220 --> 10:13.220
Just like that.
I mean, just like
in a movie you'd see.

10:13.220 --> 10:16.180
That nitro, it'll do it,
man. It'll pop.

10:16.180 --> 10:17.470
Scared the hell out of me.

10:17.470 --> 10:20.520
Mike:
Captain Midnight
also lived on the premises

10:20.520 --> 10:21.810
from time to time.

10:21.810 --> 10:26.430
Captain Midnight was living,
sort of, in Waylon's closet.

10:26.430 --> 10:29.270
Kyle:
He had a little office
that he-- with a hot plate.

10:29.270 --> 10:33.020
(chuckles) Yeah!
Midnight could walk
into the control room

10:33.020 --> 10:35.770
and sort of assess
whatever the situation was,

10:35.770 --> 10:39.560
and say whatever
the three-word sentence
would require

10:39.560 --> 10:42.770
to set the whole thing off
in some sort of explosion.

10:42.770 --> 10:45.220
And I saw him get
run out of there often,

10:45.220 --> 10:47.640
you know, with fairly
violent threats.

10:47.640 --> 10:49.850
Ron: Once,
he was throwing knives.

10:49.850 --> 10:52.890
Waylon walked
somewhere close by.

10:52.890 --> 10:55.060
I think he missed Waylon
by about a foot.

10:55.060 --> 10:57.680
Kyle:
Midnight would spend
hours out there,

10:57.680 --> 11:01.220
just throwing the knives,
you know, and sticking 'em
in the door.

11:01.220 --> 11:02.730
He got pretty good at it.

11:02.730 --> 11:05.390
It was not like being
in New York.

11:05.390 --> 11:10.310
The first album
I made with Waylon
took a week to record.

11:10.310 --> 11:13.220
The second album I recorded
with Waylon took two weeks.

11:13.220 --> 11:17.930
I just, you know,
hit "record" and tried
to stay out of the way.

11:17.930 --> 11:20.600
Mike:
The biggest record
ever made during this movement

11:20.600 --> 11:22.600
featured Waylon, Willie Nelson,

11:22.600 --> 11:24.600
Jessi, and Tompall.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.600
Wanted! The Outlaws.

11:26.600 --> 11:30.560
♪ She just talks about
the good times they've had ♪

11:30.560 --> 11:33.060
♪ And all the good times
to come ♪

11:36.100 --> 11:38.850
♪ She's a good-hearted woman ♪

11:38.850 --> 11:42.600
♪ In love
with a good-timing man ♪

11:42.600 --> 11:45.180
Mike:
Wanted! became the first
country music record

11:45.180 --> 11:47.770
out of Nashville
to be certified platinum

11:47.770 --> 11:49.430
for a million units sold.

11:49.430 --> 11:52.890
The Outlaws  record,
like most things
that become successful,

11:52.890 --> 11:54.730
there's a blessing
and a curse.

11:54.730 --> 11:58.310
Waylon was adopted
by the Hell's Angels.

11:58.310 --> 12:00.930
We'd show up
at a festival somewhere...

12:00.930 --> 12:02.980
(motorcycles revving)
...and Waylon would be like,

12:02.980 --> 12:04.850
"Oh God,
here they are again."

12:04.850 --> 12:05.890
(bikers whooping)

12:05.890 --> 12:07.890
Crank:
They command
so much respect

12:07.890 --> 12:09.980
that nothing ever happened,

12:09.980 --> 12:12.640
because if you've got
two six-shooters

12:12.640 --> 12:14.470
and carrying
a sawed-off shotgun,

12:14.470 --> 12:16.100
you're probably not
gonna be messed with.

12:16.100 --> 12:19.350
Mike:
Roger "Crank" Payne
and Jerry "Jigger" Bridges

12:19.350 --> 12:22.730
were in the band
and under the protection
of the Hell's Angels,

12:22.730 --> 12:25.730
as was Waylon's family,
his wife Jessi,

12:25.730 --> 12:27.390
and his youngest son, Shooter.

12:27.390 --> 12:30.100
I was being literally babysat
by Hell's Angels,

12:30.100 --> 12:31.220
and they were very nice.

12:31.220 --> 12:32.520
The one guy, Hot Foot,

12:32.520 --> 12:34.890
I remember him going
to a putt-putt course

12:34.890 --> 12:36.520
with me when
I was a little kid.

12:36.520 --> 12:37.930
And we got this guy
named Boomer.

12:37.930 --> 12:42.020
He was one
of the original
Filthy Few from New York,

12:42.020 --> 12:45.470
the quietest person
you ever seen.

12:45.470 --> 12:48.140
I remember
from a very little age,

12:48.140 --> 12:50.100
I was like,
"That dude is cool."

12:50.100 --> 12:52.100
He had a cane
with a skeleton on it.

12:52.100 --> 12:55.890
Jigger:
There was a skull,
gold skull on top of it,

12:55.890 --> 12:57.850
and his teeth
were solid gold.

12:57.850 --> 13:00.470
After he had 'em a while,
he said, "They don't--

13:00.470 --> 13:02.810
(smacking, clicking)
"They don't make
that kind of stuff

13:02.810 --> 13:06.350
to hold up very good,
changing the way I talk."
(laughs)

13:06.350 --> 13:08.140
Kind of heavy.
(laughs)
'Cause just in there,

13:08.140 --> 13:09.930
and it was
falling down on him.

13:09.930 --> 13:13.430
He gave me a PEZ dispenser
with a skull on the end of it,

13:13.430 --> 13:15.390
'cause he knew how much
I loved that cane of his.

13:15.390 --> 13:18.220
Crank: He was
always buying you stuff,
bringing you gifts--

13:18.220 --> 13:20.980
rifles and handguns,
you know.

13:20.980 --> 13:23.730
I didn't ask.
I just took 'em all.
(chuckles)

13:23.730 --> 13:26.390
Mike:
Surrounded by Hell's Angels
on the road,

13:26.390 --> 13:29.640
labeled an outlaw
by record executives
in Nashville,

13:29.640 --> 13:33.140
Waylon continued
to surprise country fans
with his music.

13:33.140 --> 13:36.140
I'll never forget it.
We were in Lakeland, Florida,

13:36.140 --> 13:39.100
and everybody was excited
about this one song.

13:39.100 --> 13:41.730
And so we got
about three-quarters
through the set,

13:41.730 --> 13:44.520
and Waylon says,
"You guys wanna hear
a brand-new song?"

13:44.520 --> 13:47.060
The crowd goes, "Yeah!"
Man: Whoo!

13:47.060 --> 13:48.810
So he says,
"All right, here we go."

13:48.810 --> 13:52.560
♪ I don't need my name
in the marquee lights ♪

13:52.560 --> 13:57.560
(man shouts)
♪ 'Cause I got my song
and I got you with me tonight ♪

13:57.560 --> 14:03.020
♪ Maybe it's time we got down
to some basics in love ♪

14:03.020 --> 14:04.310
(crowd cheering)

14:04.310 --> 14:06.930
♪ Let's go
to Luckenbach, Texas ♪

14:06.930 --> 14:10.270
♪ With Waylon and Willie
and the boys ♪

14:12.850 --> 14:15.100
♪ This successful life
we're living's ♪

14:15.100 --> 14:18.270
♪ Got us feuding like
the Hatfields and McCoys ♪

14:18.270 --> 14:20.600
Crank:
The second time
we sang the chorus,

14:20.600 --> 14:23.270
you could hear
the crowd singing along.

14:23.270 --> 14:26.430
It was the damnedest thing
I'd ever heard.

14:26.430 --> 14:28.310
♪ Let's go
to Luckenbach, Texas ♪

14:28.310 --> 14:30.100
And they're
singing it loud.

14:30.100 --> 14:32.890
♪ Luckenbach, Texas ♪
Loud, and it got so loud,

14:32.890 --> 14:34.220
Waylon just stopped playing.

14:34.220 --> 14:35.930
He turned to us,
and we're all--

14:35.930 --> 14:38.520
I'll never forget
the chills.
Remember that?

14:38.520 --> 14:40.680
Mm-hm.
And right then,
after that show,

14:40.680 --> 14:42.810
he said,
"Boys, strap it on."
It was a big record.

14:42.810 --> 14:45.730
"This thing's fixing
to go big."

14:45.730 --> 14:48.270
Mike:
It was April, 1977,

14:48.270 --> 14:51.180
and "Luckenbach, Texas"
went straight to number one

14:51.180 --> 14:53.470
and stayed there
until the summer.

14:53.470 --> 14:55.270
We were somewhere
in the Midwest,

14:55.270 --> 14:57.520
had a few days off
in the middle of the tour,

14:57.520 --> 14:58.810
and just hanging out

14:58.810 --> 15:00.640
in the Holiday Inn
or whatever.

15:00.640 --> 15:03.180
And, uh, Waylon comes
to us and said,

15:03.180 --> 15:06.600
"Hey, you guys want
to go to New York?"
So, "Sure."

15:06.600 --> 15:09.140
Six of us get in the Learjet
and go to New York City.

15:09.140 --> 15:12.310
He wore this long
leather trench coat,

15:12.310 --> 15:13.730
'cause I think
it was wintertime,

15:13.730 --> 15:16.600
and in his inside pocket,
he had a check

15:16.600 --> 15:19.390
with his name on it
for a million dollars.

15:19.390 --> 15:21.470
(both laugh)
And he would take
that silly thing out

15:21.470 --> 15:24.220
and show it to people.
"Look, that's me.

15:24.220 --> 15:26.640
I got a million dollars."

15:26.640 --> 15:27.980
Mike:
Four months later,

15:27.980 --> 15:29.930
after the biggest hit
of his career,

15:29.930 --> 15:31.520
came the shock of his life.

15:31.520 --> 15:34.180
Waylon was expecting
a package from New York,

15:34.180 --> 15:37.640
and, uh, it didn't come in.
And he finally said
something to me.

15:37.640 --> 15:39.020
I said, "Well,
how long has it been?"

15:39.020 --> 15:40.890
He said,
"Ah, about three days."

15:40.890 --> 15:42.980
And I said,
"That ain't good."

15:42.980 --> 15:45.730
Neil Reshen,
Waylon's longtime manager,

15:45.730 --> 15:49.520
he was getting paranoid
Waylon was buying too much
cocaine on the road,

15:49.520 --> 15:51.350
and here and there,
and so he found a way--

15:51.350 --> 15:55.470
what he thought was
a way-- to get it to him
without a whole lot of trouble.

15:55.470 --> 15:57.680
So they flew it in
in a package.

15:57.680 --> 15:59.390
It was a kilo of cocaine.

15:59.390 --> 16:02.180
Neil had his underling,
Mark Rothbaum,

16:02.180 --> 16:03.470
he sent the package.

16:03.470 --> 16:05.890
Richie:
Finally, the secretary,
Lori Evans,

16:05.890 --> 16:08.600
picked it up
and brought it
to the studio.

16:08.600 --> 16:10.560
Waylon was overdubbing,
you know,

16:10.560 --> 16:12.730
one of the songs off
I've Always Been Crazy,

16:12.730 --> 16:16.560
and all the sudden went,
"Boom, boom, boom, boom."
(pounding on door)

16:16.560 --> 16:18.730
And in come four, five guys.

16:18.730 --> 16:22.520
The had their
"FBI," "DEA" on 'em.
Going, "Oh shit."

16:22.520 --> 16:25.430
They said,
"We followed
a package here.

16:25.430 --> 16:27.270
We want to find
that package."

16:27.270 --> 16:31.430
When I looked up,
there was a communication
button on the desk,

16:31.430 --> 16:33.390
so I just laid
my hand on it.

16:33.390 --> 16:36.100
Crank:
Richie said,
"Ain't no package here."

16:36.100 --> 16:38.890
So what's happening
with this talk-back,

16:38.890 --> 16:42.100
is Waylon's hearing
everything Richie says.

16:42.100 --> 16:45.470
So Waylon knows,
"Ah crap, we're being busted."

16:45.470 --> 16:48.930
And, uh, I said,
"Well, okay, you got
a search warrant?"

16:48.930 --> 16:50.890
Said, "No,
but we can get one."

16:50.890 --> 16:53.470
I said, "Okay,
but while you're getting
that search warrant,

16:53.470 --> 16:54.850
"we're gonna keep
working here,

16:54.850 --> 16:57.640
because it's costing us
$250 an hour."

16:57.640 --> 17:01.100
Richie goes and tells
the guys, says, "Look,
it's very important record.

17:01.100 --> 17:04.520
"Let me finish this vocal.
Take me about 30 minutes.

17:04.520 --> 17:07.810
Let me finish this vocal,
and you guys can look and do
whatever you want."

17:07.810 --> 17:10.390
Richie:
And I told the agents,
"You all just be quiet."

17:10.390 --> 17:11.930
Crank:
"Waylon, let's try it
from the top."

17:11.930 --> 17:14.600
So he gets
about 16 bars into it,

17:14.600 --> 17:16.730
he said, "Waylon,
I need to change
that microphone.

17:16.730 --> 17:19.270
Hang on right there.
I'm gonna come and change
that microphone."

17:19.270 --> 17:23.680
And I'm going,
"Holy crap. That was
so cool, Richie."

17:23.680 --> 17:26.730
So we go out there,
moving the microphone.

17:26.730 --> 17:28.060
I found the package,

17:28.060 --> 17:30.270
put it in my pants,
came back out.

17:30.270 --> 17:32.930
During that time,
George Laibe,

17:32.930 --> 17:35.220
who did our booking,
came walking in.

17:35.220 --> 17:37.520
He was about half drunk,
and he started hollering,

17:37.520 --> 17:39.730
"What in the hell
is going on?"  (babbles)

17:39.730 --> 17:41.850
And Waylon started
hollering at him.

17:41.850 --> 17:45.470
Pretty soon,
every agent's all looking
right at them.

17:45.470 --> 17:48.270
And that's when I turned
and went in the bathroom.

17:48.270 --> 17:50.140
When they heard
that thing flush,

17:50.140 --> 17:51.980
it was over.
(flushes)

17:51.980 --> 17:54.470
Waylon started talking
to the DEA,

17:54.470 --> 17:57.310
laying his best
snow job on 'em.
(chuckles)

17:57.310 --> 18:02.810
You could tell they were
all a little bit enthused
and admired him.

18:02.810 --> 18:05.390
After they got busted
and it all went down,

18:05.390 --> 18:08.180
they flew out
in the Learjet the next day,

18:08.180 --> 18:11.470
and I met them at the airport
with the limousines
and everything.

18:11.470 --> 18:12.980
I was the road manager.

18:12.980 --> 18:15.770
And Waylon and Richie
and Jessi, they jump
into the car,

18:15.770 --> 18:18.430
and they go, "Hey, Bourke,
how's it going?" You know.

18:18.430 --> 18:21.270
I go, "It's going great.
How are you guys doing?"

18:21.270 --> 18:23.520
And, you know, it had been
on the newspapers, television.

18:23.520 --> 18:27.140
It was a big deal.
And he says, "Bourke,
I just wrote a song."

18:27.140 --> 18:30.770
♪ I'm for law and order,
the way it should be ♪

18:30.770 --> 18:33.020
And of course,
that song went
to number one

18:33.020 --> 18:34.850
and made him
a million dollars, you know.

18:34.850 --> 18:39.180
♪ I'm for law and order,
the way that it should be ♪

18:41.310 --> 18:45.560
♪ This song's about the night
they spent protecting
you from me ♪

18:47.890 --> 18:51.850

18:53.930 --> 18:58.100

19:01.220 --> 19:06.220
♪ Don't y'all think

got out of hand? ♪

19:06.220 --> 19:08.270
Mike:
He was charged
with conspiracy

19:08.270 --> 19:10.810
and possession
with intent to distribute.

19:10.810 --> 19:14.020
Those charges were dropped
before it ever went to trial.

19:14.020 --> 19:16.520
They had no evidence, basically.

19:16.520 --> 19:19.270
Mike:
The bust didn't phase
Hoss that much.

19:19.270 --> 19:21.310
A year or two later,
he got an invitation

19:21.310 --> 19:24.060
from Hollywood,
too good to pass up.

19:24.060 --> 19:25.310
To this day,

19:25.310 --> 19:26.730
the only reason I watch
Dukes of Hazard

19:26.730 --> 19:29.310
is to listen to Dad do
the balladeer part,

19:29.310 --> 19:31.180
you know, like "Well, the boys

19:31.180 --> 19:33.060
aren't gonna get away
with it this time."

19:33.060 --> 19:35.680
You can tell by how hoarse
his voice is

19:35.680 --> 19:37.270
how many days he's been awake.

19:37.270 --> 19:40.770
Mike: By then
his oldest son, Terry,
was on the road with him.

19:40.770 --> 19:43.220
I remember that some article
in a paper had come out

19:43.220 --> 19:47.270
and said that Dad smoked
five packs of cigarettes a day.

19:47.270 --> 19:50.100
Well, some accountant come up
and says, "I did the math.

19:50.100 --> 19:54.100
It is physically impossible
to smoke five packs
of cigarettes a day."

19:54.100 --> 19:57.730
And we looked at him
and said, "Well, not if
you stay up for 24 hours."

19:57.730 --> 20:00.810
Tom:
He'd go five days
without going to bed.

20:00.810 --> 20:03.770
And you could tell--
his hair would be all
greased up, you know.

20:03.770 --> 20:06.430
You could tell he hadn't
been taking a bath.
(laughs)

20:06.430 --> 20:10.140
Waylon developed
this fondness for Musk.

20:10.140 --> 20:11.470
There was Musk cologne.

20:11.470 --> 20:13.390
There was Musk
underarm deodorant.

20:13.390 --> 20:14.810
Waylon loved
the shit, right?

20:14.810 --> 20:16.770
I mean, you could smell it
coming a mile away.

20:16.770 --> 20:19.600
Well, I went down
to his office one morning--

20:19.600 --> 20:21.310
you know, 2:00, 3:00
in the morning--

20:21.310 --> 20:24.850
and Waylon was there,
and he had probably been up
for two, three, four days.

20:24.850 --> 20:28.310
And we started talking
about something or other,

20:28.310 --> 20:30.770
and all of the sudden,
he takes out

20:30.770 --> 20:34.140
this Musk underarm
deodorant thing,

20:34.140 --> 20:36.930
and he starts putting it on,
except it was over his shirt.

20:36.930 --> 20:39.600
And I said, "Waylon,
I mean, do you know that

20:39.600 --> 20:43.180
you're putting
that underarm stuff
on over your shirt?"

20:43.180 --> 20:44.350
He said, "Hoss...

20:45.640 --> 20:46.980
that's my business."

20:46.980 --> 20:48.180
(both laugh)

20:48.180 --> 20:51.180
After that bust,
the paranoia level
went way up.

20:51.180 --> 20:53.270
Every time we'd go
into a hotel room,

20:53.270 --> 20:56.100
I was unscrewing the phone,
I was checking under the bed.

20:56.100 --> 20:59.060
And, you know, always looking
over your shoulder. You know?

20:59.060 --> 21:01.220
Neil Reshen, the manager,
came on the road

21:01.220 --> 21:02.890
one time with Waylon,
and he said,

21:02.890 --> 21:04.680
"Man, I just got
a new pacemaker."

21:04.680 --> 21:06.060
I said, "Really?"
And he said, "Yeah."

21:06.060 --> 21:07.350
He said, "You know,
check it out."

21:07.350 --> 21:08.770
And I said,
"What do you mean?"
He said,

21:08.770 --> 21:10.310
"Just put your head
down there and listen."

21:10.310 --> 21:12.180
So when I did,
then he got the coke out

21:12.180 --> 21:13.850
and did a big bump,
and when he did...

21:13.850 --> 21:15.180
(trills)... you know?

21:15.180 --> 21:17.020
Waylon thought that was
the coolest thing ever.

21:17.020 --> 21:20.100
(laughs)
Believe it or not,
there can come a time

21:20.100 --> 21:23.060
when there's
so many drugs around
that you don't want to do 'em.

21:23.060 --> 21:26.930
I mean, you gotta really
try hard to keep on doing 'em,
'cause the fun is gone.

21:26.930 --> 21:30.850
Mike:
In 1984, the greatest
outlaw of the movement,

21:30.850 --> 21:32.890
the man who broke free
from Nashville

21:32.890 --> 21:35.350
in a rage of pills
and cocaine,

21:35.350 --> 21:38.470
decided to clean up
his act... the hard way.

21:38.470 --> 21:42.270
I was with him
when he went to Phoenix
to sober up.

21:42.270 --> 21:44.980
There was
no doctors or hospitals
or anything like that.

21:44.980 --> 21:46.890
He did it himself,
cold turkey.

21:46.890 --> 21:49.730
He said, "This isn't
gonna work anymore.

21:49.730 --> 21:51.020
"We're stopping right now.

21:51.020 --> 21:52.980
"Tell everybody
in the organization

21:52.980 --> 21:54.890
that if you're wired,
you're fired."

21:54.890 --> 21:57.020
Waylon said,
"You should've heard Jessi

21:57.020 --> 21:59.890
"the day I gave her
about a half a pound.

21:59.890 --> 22:01.680
"And I said,
'Jessi, I'm done.

22:01.680 --> 22:04.560
"'Take this and do with it
whatever you want.'"

22:04.560 --> 22:05.850
He said,
"You should've heard her."

22:05.850 --> 22:07.600
He said, "I heard her
in there in the bathroom

22:07.600 --> 22:09.020
"as she's pouring it down,

22:09.020 --> 22:11.100
"saying, 'Praise Jesus!
Praise you, Jesus,'

22:11.100 --> 22:13.890
while she's pouring it
down the commode."

22:13.890 --> 22:15.770
(laughs)

22:15.770 --> 22:18.100
He was a blessed man.
I will tell you that.

22:18.100 --> 22:19.640
He was a blessed man...
That's for sure.

22:19.640 --> 22:23.980
...because he had a woman
who loved him forever.

22:23.980 --> 22:26.600
Her life revolved
around Waylon.

22:26.600 --> 22:29.600
She had an enormous record
called "I'm Not Lisa."

22:29.600 --> 22:32.850
And I got a call
from the head of the label,

22:32.850 --> 22:35.810
and he asked me
to talk to Waylon

22:35.810 --> 22:40.020
to try to convince Jessi
to continue on with her career.

22:40.020 --> 22:42.020
So I went to Waylon,
and I said, "Waylon,

22:42.020 --> 22:44.310
"the label as asked me
to talk to you.

22:44.310 --> 22:45.930
"They would like
to continue on

22:45.930 --> 22:48.100
with Jessi's career,"
and so on.

22:48.100 --> 22:52.560
And Waylon just
looked at me, he said,
"Hoss, ain't your business."

22:52.560 --> 22:55.810
And I called the label,
and I said, "It ain't
gonna happen, man."

22:55.810 --> 22:58.270
"That woman loves him
more than anything,

22:58.270 --> 23:02.520
and however that life is going
is the way it's gonna stay."

23:02.520 --> 23:06.140
Mike:
And it stayed that way
until the very end.

23:06.140 --> 23:09.680
He actually loved me, man.
He said, "Billy, you know,

23:09.680 --> 23:11.560
it ain't fair,
you not having a hand."

23:11.560 --> 23:14.180
He said,
"Let me buy you a hand."

23:14.180 --> 23:18.640
And I said, "No, oh shit.
It probably wouldn't work."

23:18.640 --> 23:23.520
There was song called
"Oklahoma Wind" that he did
with me and Kris and Willie.

23:23.520 --> 23:30.180
I had written about
the "Oklahoma kid
laid dying in a women's wing."

23:30.180 --> 23:32.470
And he thought
it was something else.

23:32.470 --> 23:36.310
And what it was,
was an old folks home,
and it was a women's wing.

23:36.310 --> 23:38.730
The Indian was
down there dying.

23:38.730 --> 23:43.140
He took it wrong.
He thought it was
some kind of spiritual deal.

23:43.140 --> 23:44.850
And when I explained it
to him, he said,

23:44.850 --> 23:47.850
"Damn, I wish
I hadn't asked you."
(laughs)

23:47.850 --> 23:49.810
He was loving it until then.

23:49.810 --> 23:53.140
I don't know.
He was kind of funny about it.
Funny as I am, really.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.140
Every bit of it.

23:56.140 --> 23:58.930
I loved Waylon though,
I really did.

23:58.930 --> 24:01.850
A lot of people don't think
I did, but I did.

24:01.850 --> 24:05.220
He was blessed,
because he chose people

24:05.220 --> 24:09.850
to be in his life
that loved him and who
will always love him.

24:09.850 --> 24:13.810
And dadgum it,
he left too soon.

24:13.810 --> 24:16.600
You know,
he was a good ol' boy.
