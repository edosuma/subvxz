ERIN:
<i>Let's go, Nicky. You don't want</i>

00:05.728 --> 00:08.795
to be late for Grandpa!
It's fine. School doesn't start

00:08.797 --> 00:10.197
till noon.
It's a teacher workday.

00:10.199 --> 00:12.733
He's got things on his plate,
too. Let's go!

00:12.735 --> 00:15.902
Okay. Hey,
did you see my gloves?

00:15.904 --> 00:18.271
Yeah, they're
on the kitchen counter.

00:18.273 --> 00:20.273
Have you seen my briefcase?

00:20.275 --> 00:22.809
Yeah.
Living room chair.

00:25.781 --> 00:27.180
Ouch.

00:27.182 --> 00:28.815
(hisses)

00:33.655 --> 00:35.789
Did you move this table?

00:35.791 --> 00:37.190
No.

00:37.192 --> 00:38.825
Okay,

00:38.827 --> 00:39.493
I'm off.

00:39.495 --> 00:41.061
Oh, wait. Hold on.

00:42.464 --> 00:43.997
Bye. Have a good day.

00:43.999 --> 00:45.565
Love you.
Give a kiss to Grandpa.

00:45.567 --> 00:47.768
I'll see you later.

WOMAN:
911, what is your emergency?

01:08.023 --> 01:09.256
Hi, this is Erin Reagan

01:09.258 --> 01:11.525
with the Manhattan
District Attorney's Office.

01:11.527 --> 01:14.728
I need to report a break-in.

01:19.401 --> 01:21.568
No, I'm not talking
about your major.

01:21.570 --> 01:25.105
I'm talking about what you want
to get out of college,

01:25.107 --> 01:28.442
what you want to leave with,
besides the sheepskin.

01:28.444 --> 01:30.110
That's complicated.

01:30.112 --> 01:31.511
Then make it simple.

01:31.513 --> 01:33.313
I want to go out into the world

01:33.315 --> 01:35.882
without a suit of snark
and cynicism.

01:35.884 --> 01:37.284
I want to...

01:37.286 --> 01:39.219
attract people
to a kind of optimism

01:39.221 --> 01:41.721
that's hard to find
most days and places.

01:41.723 --> 01:42.789
Tough order.

01:42.791 --> 01:43.723
I know.
And you're gonna

01:43.725 --> 01:45.125
have a tough time making
a living

01:45.127 --> 01:47.160
assuming the best in people.

01:47.162 --> 01:49.796
(sighs)

01:49.798 --> 01:51.131
Look,

01:51.133 --> 01:53.500
I admire what you do, Grandpa.

01:53.502 --> 01:56.970
And what
Mom does.

01:56.972 --> 02:00.574
I think it would wear me down
and out.

02:02.211 --> 02:05.912
Well, Nicky...

02:05.914 --> 02:10.250
I think this family's put in
more than enough service

02:10.252 --> 02:14.488
to earn
one bleeding-heart do-gooder.

02:15.858 --> 02:17.858
You forgot hippie.

02:17.860 --> 02:19.059
They still say that?

02:19.061 --> 02:20.260
It's coming back.

02:20.262 --> 02:21.828
Okay. Hippie.

02:21.830 --> 02:25.232
Hi, folks. I'm collecting
for the Local Heroes Fund.

02:25.234 --> 02:26.800
Would you care to contribute?

02:26.802 --> 02:28.735
Boy, have you come
to the right place.

02:28.737 --> 02:30.270
I haven't heard of this fund.

02:30.272 --> 02:31.471
It's a great cause.

02:31.473 --> 02:33.473
All proceeds go to,
like, survivor families

02:33.475 --> 02:34.441
and their needs.

02:34.443 --> 02:36.810
Survivors of what?

02:36.812 --> 02:38.345
Well, 9/11.

02:38.347 --> 02:40.180
That was 14 years ago.

02:41.350 --> 02:43.083
Other tragedies, too.

02:43.085 --> 02:46.119
Do you have your tax I.D.
and charity registration number?

02:46.121 --> 02:48.922
Sir, if you don't want
to contribute, just say so.

02:48.924 --> 02:50.056
Grandpa.
(scoffs)

02:50.058 --> 02:51.925
(chuckles)
Who's he think he is?

02:53.829 --> 02:57.097
Well,
he's the police commissioner.

03:04.439 --> 03:07.807
Um, I'll have them send
those numbers to you.

03:10.045 --> 03:11.912
I have
a better idea.

03:11.914 --> 03:13.613
Take me to them.

03:15.250 --> 03:16.983
Look, I-I haven't
done anything.

03:16.985 --> 03:18.251
I'm not saying
you have, but that

03:18.253 --> 03:21.354
is the NYPD logo you're using
to raise money here.

03:21.356 --> 03:23.690
It's all legit. I swear.

03:23.692 --> 03:28.328
Then I just want to say thank
you to whoever's in charge.

03:35.837 --> 03:37.804
(whining)
BOY: Bungee!

03:37.806 --> 03:38.972
(barks)

03:38.974 --> 03:40.507
Thank you so much.

03:40.509 --> 03:41.741
We've been looking
everywhere.

03:41.743 --> 03:43.743
Yeah, we saw your fliers
a couple blocks away,

03:43.745 --> 03:46.112
and then ten minutes later,
he ran out in front of our car.

03:46.114 --> 03:48.014
Well, you've made a boy
very happy.

03:48.016 --> 03:50.250
Well, Bungee doesn't look
too upset either, so...

03:50.252 --> 03:52.586
You guys take care, okay, ma'am?
We will.

03:52.588 --> 03:53.853
And thanks again.

03:53.855 --> 03:55.922
JAMIE:
Absolutely.

03:55.924 --> 03:58.058
Do you think
that we should bill them

03:58.060 --> 04:00.393
for Bungee slobbering
all over our backseat?

04:00.395 --> 04:03.029
We don't bill the perps when they do it.
(chuckles)

04:03.031 --> 04:04.698
Meg!

04:05.601 --> 04:07.934
Oh, I knew I heard your voice.

04:07.936 --> 04:10.604
Oh, Meg.
Oh.

04:10.606 --> 04:12.606
Oh...
Oh, no, I'm not Meg.

04:12.608 --> 04:14.007
Oh.
Oh. My good Lord,

04:14.009 --> 04:17.911
you're finally home.

04:17.913 --> 04:23.016
And you look so sharp
in your uniform.

04:24.286 --> 04:27.153
And who is
this handsome young man?

04:27.155 --> 04:28.722
I'm her partner, Jamie.

04:28.724 --> 04:30.357
Well, hi.

04:30.359 --> 04:32.926
I'm-I'm Meg's aunt, Beth.

04:32.928 --> 04:35.929
Nice to meet you.
(chuckles)

04:35.931 --> 04:40.467
Sweetheart, you came back
at just the right time.

04:40.469 --> 04:43.336
One of my boarders
left out back

04:43.338 --> 04:47.073
not five minutes ago.
He left behind this

04:47.075 --> 04:49.643
big box of fireworks.

04:49.645 --> 04:51.411
Now, can
you go in

04:51.413 --> 04:54.080
and take 'em away
so nobody gets hurt?

04:54.082 --> 04:55.682
F-Fireworks?

04:55.684 --> 04:56.716
Yeah.

04:56.718 --> 04:57.817
Of course we can, Beth.

04:57.819 --> 05:00.387
Come on, partner.
Let's go help your aunt.

05:00.389 --> 05:02.889
Oh, thank you.
(Janko speaks indistinctly)

05:02.891 --> 05:04.524
His name was JJ.

05:04.526 --> 05:05.992
Uh, get the door.

05:05.994 --> 05:09.729
He was staying... he was
staying in-in your old room...

05:09.731 --> 05:10.964
Hey, what's going on?

05:10.966 --> 05:12.032
Nothing to worry
about, ma'am.

05:12.034 --> 05:13.066
Yeah. It's okay,

05:13.068 --> 05:14.834
Maria.

05:14.836 --> 05:17.504
Just JJ being a problem again.

05:17.506 --> 05:18.938
JJ saw

05:18.940 --> 05:20.807
you two out
the window,

05:20.809 --> 05:23.843
grabbed what he could,
and ran out back.

05:23.845 --> 05:26.413
Didn't even ask me
for his deposit.

05:26.415 --> 05:28.148
(creaking)

05:28.150 --> 05:30.216
Fireworks. They're
right in there.

05:30.218 --> 05:32.285
Don't worry. We'll dispose
of these safely, ma'am.

05:32.287 --> 05:34.087
Okay.

05:34.089 --> 05:36.756
(sighs)

05:45.734 --> 05:49.936
Not the pizza box.
The box on the bed.

05:53.208 --> 05:56.476
Jamie, I think this
is a pipe bomb.

05:56.478 --> 05:58.178
Beth, Maria, go outside.

05:58.180 --> 05:59.412
What's wrong?

05:59.414 --> 06:00.246
Just go right now.

06:00.248 --> 06:02.215
Come on, let's go.

06:05.454 --> 06:06.820
(beeping)
Jamie.

06:06.822 --> 06:08.054
Jamie.

06:08.056 --> 06:09.489
Jamie. Jamie.
Go.

06:09.491 --> 06:11.591
(beeping continues)

06:17.733 --> 06:19.833
Are you okay?

06:19.835 --> 06:21.401
Yeah.
Are you sure?

06:21.403 --> 06:23.169
Yeah, I think so. Are you okay?

06:23.171 --> 06:25.138
Yeah.

Oh, ears are still ringing

It's not my first rodeo,
Officer.

07:26.491 --> 07:28.625
Okay.

07:30.495 --> 07:33.963
Hey, Maria. How you doing?

07:33.965 --> 07:35.298
Fine, I guess.

07:35.300 --> 07:37.500
What can you tell us about JJ?

07:37.502 --> 07:39.002
Nothing.

07:39.004 --> 07:42.405
Nothing? Not even his last
name or what “JJ” stands for?

07:42.407 --> 07:44.641
People like us
don't ask questions.

07:46.278 --> 07:48.278
Was he an addict, too?

07:49.114 --> 07:51.147
Just a jerk.

07:51.149 --> 07:52.548
Another middle-aged white dude
bitching

07:52.550 --> 07:54.717
about minorities taking his job.

07:54.719 --> 07:56.686
So he was unemployed.

07:56.688 --> 07:58.054
With a big chip on his shoulder.

07:58.056 --> 08:00.657
One time he talked about blowing
up whoever it was who fired him,

08:00.659 --> 08:03.326
but I just thought
he was talking out his ass.

08:03.328 --> 08:05.895
So you don't know where he worked or
where he might've gone?

08:05.897 --> 08:07.930
No. Beth might know,

08:07.932 --> 08:09.499
if you can trust what she says.

08:09.501 --> 08:10.967
I mean, nice lady and all

08:10.969 --> 08:13.336
but she's nuttier
than squirrel crap.

BETH: Meg! Where's Meg?
BALDIKOSKI: Ma'am.

08:15.340 --> 08:17.540
Meg? Meg!
Ma'am, it's okay.

08:17.542 --> 08:19.575
Beth, I'm right here.
I'm right here. It's okay. Beth. Hey.

08:19.577 --> 08:21.611
I'm right here.
Who are all these people?

08:21.613 --> 08:24.147
And why can't I go
in my apartment?

08:24.149 --> 08:26.082
It's like we said, it's because of the box
Hey, hey, hey.

08:26.084 --> 08:27.817
of fireworks that J... just a second,
Hey. Hey, I'm not, I'm not,

08:27.819 --> 08:28.918
I'm not done with her.
hang on--

08:28.920 --> 08:30.119
that JJ left behind.
I'm not done with her.

08:30.121 --> 08:31.321
Hey.

08:31.323 --> 08:32.922
Guys, this might work better

08:32.924 --> 08:34.390
if we take her someplace
a little quieter

08:34.392 --> 08:36.558
like the precinct.

08:39.664 --> 08:41.530
Okay.

08:41.533 --> 08:43.799
Great. Let's-let's take... let's
take a ride, Beth. Come on.

08:43.802 --> 08:46.502
Take a ride
with me. Please.

08:49.808 --> 08:52.375
You remember how cocky
he was before trial.

08:52.377 --> 08:54.243
I get him on the stand,

08:54.245 --> 08:55.878
and within
five minutes,

08:55.880 --> 09:00.116
he's crying and he's
confessed to everything.

09:00.118 --> 09:02.085
That's pretty
great, right?

09:02.087 --> 09:05.254
What? That's great, Morgan.
Nice work.

09:07.392 --> 09:10.660
Can you file this
for me? Thanks.

09:12.530 --> 09:14.063
(gasps)

09:14.065 --> 09:16.099
Danny.
So when were you gonna tell me?

09:16.101 --> 09:17.633
Tell you what?

09:17.635 --> 09:19.302
About your midnight visitor.

09:20.772 --> 09:24.006
I didn't want to bother you.
Oh,

09:24.008 --> 09:25.241
so you call 911 instead

09:25.243 --> 09:27.643
and you tell them that someone
came into your place

09:27.645 --> 09:28.811
and moved your stuff around?

09:28.813 --> 09:29.879
I'm not crazy, Danny.

09:29.881 --> 09:31.981
Someone was in my apartment
last night.

09:31.983 --> 09:33.583
Uh-huh. And twice before.

09:33.585 --> 09:36.919
Last week I came home
and my desk had been rearranged.

09:36.921 --> 09:39.255
And two days ago it was the
refrigerator. And last night

09:39.257 --> 09:41.824
someone had moved things around
and...

09:41.826 --> 09:44.594
turned a picture of Nicky
upside down.

09:44.596 --> 09:45.728
Uh-huh.

09:45.730 --> 09:47.830
Just... hear me out.

09:48.700 --> 09:51.067
(sighs)

09:51.069 --> 09:52.535
You remember when we were kids

09:52.537 --> 09:53.775
and we used to pass that book
around,<i> Helter Skelter?</i>

09:53.776 --> 09:54.370
Mm-hmm.

09:54.394 --> 09:56.063
Remember how they would sneak
into people's homes

09:56.064 --> 09:58.298
and just move things around
to freak them out?

09:58.300 --> 10:00.200
Yeah. Creepy crawling.

10:00.202 --> 10:02.302
Yeah. I think
that's what they're doing.

10:02.304 --> 10:04.471
(sighs)

10:04.473 --> 10:05.905
Okay.

10:05.907 --> 10:08.174
Do you have any idea
who would do it?

10:08.176 --> 10:10.076
It could be any number
of nutcases

10:10.078 --> 10:11.711
that I convicted
in the past year.

10:11.713 --> 10:15.982
I just have to go through
my files and narrow it down.

10:15.984 --> 10:17.717
All right. I'll get Baez.

10:17.719 --> 10:20.320
We'll go by your building.
We'll check the security tapes

10:20.322 --> 10:23.656
and see if we can find
anybody getting in.

10:23.658 --> 10:25.492
Thanks.

10:25.494 --> 10:27.193
All right.

10:27.195 --> 10:30.730
And in the future, would
you call me about this stuff

10:30.732 --> 10:33.133
so I don't have to hear
about it from other people?

10:33.135 --> 10:37.170
It's a little embarrassing.

10:47.249 --> 10:49.182
The truth is,
I don't have a license

10:49.184 --> 10:50.383
for this charity.

10:50.385 --> 10:52.952
Why not?
Because the fees and administrative

10:52.954 --> 10:56.990
costs cut into the pool of money
available for charitable giving.

10:56.992 --> 10:58.525
It's not that much.

10:58.527 --> 10:59.793
It is to me.

10:59.795 --> 11:01.294
I run a small operation here,

11:01.296 --> 11:03.229
and I like
to keep things simple.

11:03.231 --> 11:05.865
Everything that comes in goes
straight out to the families.

11:05.867 --> 11:07.367
What's in the boxes?

11:07.369 --> 11:09.569
Energy-efficient lightbulbs.

11:09.571 --> 11:12.105
We solicit by phone
for Local Heroes.

11:12.107 --> 11:13.740
The lightbulbs are all donated.

11:13.742 --> 11:15.742
The 100% profit
we make goes directly

11:15.744 --> 11:17.577
into the fund for distribution.

11:17.579 --> 11:19.312
Where do you get your manpower?

11:19.314 --> 11:20.914
They're fulfilling their

11:20.916 --> 11:24.417
community service requirements
for their schools.

11:24.419 --> 11:25.718
Mm-hmm.

11:25.720 --> 11:27.220
You know, Commissioner,

11:27.222 --> 11:29.122
I've always wanted to meet you.

11:29.124 --> 11:31.124
Why'd you want to meet me?

11:31.126 --> 11:35.361
My late husband Keith worked
for MaCallan, Donohoe.

11:35.363 --> 11:38.665
He was in the North Tower
on 9/11.

11:38.667 --> 11:41.201
And I worked
at Ground Zero

11:41.203 --> 11:43.169
helping with
food service

11:43.171 --> 11:45.438
for the month after,
so I saw firsthand

11:45.440 --> 11:47.073
what you and your men were doing

11:47.075 --> 11:48.775
and what the NYPD
was going through,

11:48.777 --> 11:50.877
and I swore
that I would give back.

11:54.683 --> 11:56.616
Thank you, Ms. Vickers.

11:56.618 --> 11:58.651
Lauren... please.

11:58.653 --> 12:02.522
Lauren, um,
I hope you understand,

12:02.524 --> 12:06.192
when the NYPD logo
is used to raise money...

12:06.194 --> 12:08.461
You want to make sure
the money is going

12:08.463 --> 12:10.463
to an NYPD-worthy cause.

12:10.465 --> 12:13.433
I take it very personally.

12:13.435 --> 12:16.870
I completely understand.

12:19.341 --> 12:21.374
Please get your paperwork in.

12:21.376 --> 12:24.143
I will. I will do that today.

12:24.145 --> 12:26.279
Thank you, sir.

12:27.148 --> 12:29.515
No.

12:29.517 --> 12:31.851
Thank you.

12:31.853 --> 12:33.386
Have a good day.

12:33.388 --> 12:35.588
You, too.

12:36.391 --> 12:38.324
I'm really
proud of you.

12:38.326 --> 12:39.726
Why?

12:39.728 --> 12:41.828
Well, you could have
just busted her, right?

12:41.830 --> 12:44.264
Yes.
But you made a judgment call.

12:44.266 --> 12:46.266
You let the little
part of you that wants

12:46.268 --> 12:50.536
to believe not everyone has
an angle take over.

12:50.538 --> 12:52.739
I know that's hard for you.

12:53.608 --> 12:55.608
Yeah.

12:55.610 --> 12:57.777
Where could I drop you?

12:57.779 --> 12:59.679
Oh, the subway's just
a couple blocks away.

12:59.681 --> 13:02.315
I can walk.
No, not today.

13:02.317 --> 13:04.217
Where can I drop you?

13:04.219 --> 13:06.219
Mom?

13:06.221 --> 13:07.887
Through the grapevine.

13:07.889 --> 13:10.156
Let's go, hippie.

13:15.330 --> 13:18.731
Hey, Beth.

13:23.571 --> 13:27.040
So, you said that JJ
rented a room from you?

13:28.276 --> 13:30.043
Do you ever keep any paperwork?

13:30.045 --> 13:31.945
All I asked from my boarders is

13:31.947 --> 13:35.014
that they pay on time
and in cash.

13:35.016 --> 13:38.084
JJ couldn't even manage that.

13:38.086 --> 13:39.886
JAMIE:
Hmm.

13:39.888 --> 13:43.957
But how was I supposed to pay
my bills when you abandoned me?

13:43.959 --> 13:46.225
You haven't called

13:46.227 --> 13:49.796
once in five years!

13:54.302 --> 13:57.770
Beth, JJ must have
told you his last name

13:57.772 --> 14:00.473
when you first met him.

14:00.475 --> 14:02.709
Maybe he did.

14:04.145 --> 14:06.312
Oh, what was it?

14:08.083 --> 14:12.251
You can remember
and save a lot of lives, Beth.

14:12.253 --> 14:16.055
It's right on the tip
of my tongue.

14:17.959 --> 14:21.694
What part of “stand by the door"
did you not understand?

14:21.696 --> 14:24.731
Sorry, Detective.

14:24.733 --> 14:28.901
Okay, Ms. Behar, I've gathered
together photos of men who have

14:28.903 --> 14:30.903
the first name
or nickname of JJ.

14:30.905 --> 14:33.940
Is one of these the man
who left the fireworks?

14:41.383 --> 14:43.383
That's him.

14:43.385 --> 14:44.450
You sure?

14:44.452 --> 14:46.452
I saw him every day.

14:46.454 --> 14:48.488
That's JJ.

14:48.490 --> 14:51.224
Way to go, Beth.

14:51.226 --> 14:53.259
Outside.

15:00.035 --> 15:02.001
Get her out of here now.

15:02.003 --> 15:03.302
You could say thanks.

15:03.304 --> 15:05.405
Why? She just ID'd

15:05.407 --> 15:07.507
the one guy
in the array who's dead.

15:08.376 --> 15:10.910
Oh, whenever Officer Janko
speaks with her,

15:10.912 --> 15:13.246
she seems to be able to focus.
(phone rings)

15:13.248 --> 15:15.448
Baldikoski.

15:18.286 --> 15:20.219
Reagan, I think he's right.

15:21.222 --> 15:23.990
Beth's not gonna remember
JJ's name.

15:23.992 --> 15:26.492
Eddie, what are you talking
about? You almost had her there.

15:26.494 --> 15:28.194
Come on, come on, just...

15:28.196 --> 15:29.662
Detective, just

15:29.664 --> 15:31.097
give us a little
more time.

15:31.099 --> 15:32.565
Time is not what we have.

15:32.567 --> 15:34.967
My guys just found the car
that JJ was sleeping in.

15:34.969 --> 15:36.702
Blew up
when they opened the door

15:36.704 --> 15:38.304
and sent one to the hospital.

15:40.708 --> 15:42.341
You two-- you
want to continue

15:42.343 --> 15:44.310
to beat that dead horse,
that's fine.

15:44.312 --> 15:46.045
But I'm gonna go stop
this bastard

15:46.047 --> 15:48.781
before he hurts someone else.

15:50.318 --> 15:52.485
Come on.

15:53.388 --> 15:55.555
(sighs)

16:00.695 --> 16:02.795
Investigator's notes
for court tomorrow.

16:02.797 --> 16:05.865
Thanks. I need the transcript
from that woman you deposed.

16:05.867 --> 16:07.700
Are you okay?

16:07.702 --> 16:09.335
Yeah. Why?

16:09.337 --> 16:12.305
I gave you my deposition
five minutes ago.

16:12.307 --> 16:15.942
Sorry. I guess
I'm a little preoccupied.

16:15.944 --> 16:18.010
Do you want to talk about it?

16:18.012 --> 16:20.713
When I figure out
what the hell's going on, sure.

16:20.715 --> 16:23.316
Um, well, I was thinking
about heading out for the night,

16:23.318 --> 16:24.851
um, unless you
need anything else?

16:24.853 --> 16:26.652
No, I'm okay, Morgan. Thanks.

16:26.654 --> 16:28.988
Good night.
Good night.

16:28.990 --> 16:31.424
(phone buzzing)

16:33.528 --> 16:35.528
Danny.

16:35.530 --> 16:36.996
Oh, you're not nuts, sis.

16:36.998 --> 16:38.598
Definitely not about this.

16:38.600 --> 16:40.466
What, you've found something
at my building?

16:40.468 --> 16:41.834
Yeah.

16:41.836 --> 16:43.803
Security camera above the door
shows a woman

16:43.805 --> 16:46.139
walking in last night
and twice last week.

16:46.141 --> 16:48.908
Okay. Wow.
Can you describe her?

16:48.910 --> 16:50.476
Let me see.

16:50.478 --> 16:52.678
She looks kind of tall,
maybe around five-eight.

16:52.680 --> 16:55.548
Can't make out her face,
but she's got blonde hair.

16:55.550 --> 16:57.550
Five-eight, blonde hair.

16:57.552 --> 16:59.852
That has to be... Rita Osterman.

16:59.854 --> 17:02.755
Yeah, she did three months
last year

17:02.757 --> 17:05.157
for stalking her ex's
new girlfriend.

17:05.160 --> 17:07.425
Broke into the building,
picked the locks.

17:07.428 --> 17:09.929
Gave me the death stare
every single day of that trial.

17:09.931 --> 17:11.998
Well, maybe
she's your creepy crawler.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.398
We'll check it out, all right?

17:13.401 --> 17:15.601
Thanks, Danny.

17:17.672 --> 17:19.872
(elevator bell dings)

17:28.016 --> 17:30.216
(elevator bell dings)

17:37.725 --> 17:38.691
Morgan?

17:38.693 --> 17:41.127
(elevator bell dings)

17:49.070 --> 17:51.804
(elevator bell dings)

17:53.007 --> 17:54.941
Hi. It's Erin Reagan on Eight.

17:54.943 --> 17:57.043
I need someone up here
immediately.

17:57.045 --> 17:59.312
Thanks.

17:59.314 --> 18:01.514
(elevator bell dings)

18:10.258 --> 18:13.426
(elevator bell dings)

18:20.802 --> 18:23.002
(elevator bell dings)

18:28.676 --> 18:31.410
Whoever's up here, I've got
security on their way up!

18:31.412 --> 18:33.613
(elevator bell dings)

18:41.589 --> 18:43.789
(elevator bell dings)

18:51.799 --> 18:54.066
(elevator bell dings)

18:56.537 --> 18:58.671
(gasps)
Morgan.

18:58.673 --> 19:00.873
(panting)

19:03.711 --> 19:05.811
(elevator bell dings)

19:05.813 --> 19:08.014
(panting)

19:09.183 --> 19:10.316
(rings)

19:13.821 --> 19:18.124
I need security on Eight now
and an ambulance.

19:32.278 --> 19:35.012
You're gonna be
okay, Morgan.

19:39.271 --> 19:41.071
How's she doing?
Good, I hope.

19:41.073 --> 19:42.673
Well, let's get
you cleaned up.

19:42.675 --> 19:44.775
I got a security
detail on the way.

19:44.777 --> 19:46.443
It's gonna follow
you wherever you go.

19:46.445 --> 19:49.279
At least we know the Fathers
of Doom are the ones after me.

19:49.281 --> 19:50.848
Yeah, what's your beef
with biker gangs?

19:50.850 --> 19:52.416
I got their boss,

19:52.418 --> 19:55.953
last month, Jimmy Vitale, for
conspiracy to commit murder.

19:55.955 --> 19:57.354
Oh, that'll cause a beef.

19:57.356 --> 19:58.522
Can't believe
he's dumb enough

19:58.524 --> 20:00.257
to leave his calling
card lying around.

20:00.259 --> 20:01.525
Maybe Morgan ripped it off.

20:01.527 --> 20:02.726
I just want to know

20:02.728 --> 20:04.595
what Rita Osterman
has to do with the FOD.

20:04.597 --> 20:05.896
That's a good question.

20:05.898 --> 20:07.598
BAEZ:
Hey, guys, I don't think

20:07.600 --> 20:09.133
it's Rita,
'cause it wasn't

20:09.135 --> 20:10.601
a blonde woman this time.

20:11.403 --> 20:13.137
A white male, five-11,

20:13.139 --> 20:14.338
got into the parking garage

20:14.340 --> 20:15.340
saying he got a call

20:15.341 --> 20:16.440
to jump-start someone's car,

20:16.442 --> 20:18.108
then he came up
in the elevator.

20:18.110 --> 20:20.010
I can't see his face.

20:24.049 --> 20:25.849
Oh!

20:27.686 --> 20:29.019
He dropped the patch and then

20:29.021 --> 20:30.687
he got away down
the other elevator.

20:30.689 --> 20:32.389
Maybe one of Vitale's henchmen.

20:32.391 --> 20:35.559
Well, the judge denied bail.
He's still at Rikers.

20:35.561 --> 20:37.561
Wouldn't stop him
from issuing orders.

20:37.563 --> 20:40.030
So, let's go rev his engine.

20:40.032 --> 20:42.232
You be careful.

20:49.108 --> 20:51.842
I can't believe
JJ hurt more people.

20:51.844 --> 20:54.545
Yeah, which is why we're
running out of time.

20:54.547 --> 20:56.547
Okay. Uh...

20:56.549 --> 20:59.149
Maria mentioned that, uh,

20:59.151 --> 21:01.084
JJ was fired from some job.

21:01.086 --> 21:02.953
Did he ever mention
what that was?

21:02.955 --> 21:04.988
No.

21:04.990 --> 21:07.824
Okay, did he ever
have any visitors

21:07.826 --> 21:09.893
or did, uh, anyone
ever call him?

21:09.895 --> 21:11.662
I don't remember.

21:14.300 --> 21:17.034
Did I tell you I raised Meg
after her mother

21:17.036 --> 21:19.369
passed away?
It was so sad

21:19.371 --> 21:21.338
at first, but she grew up

21:21.340 --> 21:23.874
into such a fine young woman.

21:25.010 --> 21:26.843
Yes, and now I'm a cop, Beth,

21:26.845 --> 21:29.880
and I need your help
to find JJ, please.

21:30.716 --> 21:32.182
What happened to you?

21:33.085 --> 21:35.352
You broke my heart
when you ran off

21:35.354 --> 21:37.554
and left me here all alone.

21:39.592 --> 21:41.792
Hey, Meg?

21:44.096 --> 21:46.396
Excuse me
for a second.

21:49.801 --> 21:50.613
Anything?

21:50.637 --> 21:52.382
Yeah, I just called the
wheel, there are no officers

21:52.383 --> 21:54.016
named Meg Behar.

21:54.018 --> 21:55.517
Big surprise.

21:55.519 --> 21:57.019
If I really was her niece,

21:57.021 --> 21:58.353
I'd probably bug out, too.

21:58.355 --> 21:59.521
Yeah, well, just go try

21:59.523 --> 22:01.290
and talk to her
some more, you know?

22:01.292 --> 22:04.192
Why are you pushing me so hard?

22:04.194 --> 22:07.162
Is this therapy? Like,
Janko's family life sucks,

22:07.164 --> 22:09.298
so you want me to bond
with the old bat?

22:09.300 --> 22:11.400
What? Eddie, we almost got
blown up here earlier today.

22:11.402 --> 22:13.936
You have a connection with her,
and I think, deep down inside,

22:13.938 --> 22:15.404
she knows who this bastard is.

22:15.406 --> 22:17.906
His name was
John Johanssen.

22:17.908 --> 22:19.641
What?

22:19.643 --> 22:22.544
You asking me about JJ's job

22:22.546 --> 22:24.212
made me think about a shirt

22:24.214 --> 22:27.349
he threw in the garbage
the other day.

22:27.351 --> 22:29.551
He said he used to be proud

22:29.553 --> 22:32.187
wearing it, but not anymore.

22:34.291 --> 22:36.024
Local 242.
After

22:36.026 --> 22:38.393
seeing this, I remembered

22:38.395 --> 22:40.662
JJ isn't his first name,

22:40.664 --> 22:43.432
it's his first and last name,

22:43.434 --> 22:45.701
which is John Johanssen.

22:45.703 --> 22:47.102
You did it, Beth.

22:47.104 --> 22:49.638
You made me remember. (laughing)
Oh...

22:49.640 --> 22:52.374
I'm calling
Detective Baldikoski.

22:52.376 --> 22:54.009
Okay, I'm gonna be
right... I need to go.

22:54.011 --> 22:55.844
Oh, my God.
I need to go with Jamie, Beth.

22:55.846 --> 22:59.281
There was a Keith Vickers
who worked at MaCallan, Donohoe

22:59.283 --> 23:01.249
who perished in the collapse
of the North Tower.

23:01.251 --> 23:02.985
Leaving a widow named Lauren?
Yes, sir,

23:02.987 --> 23:05.053
but nothing pops on NCIC.

23:05.055 --> 23:06.321
Don't we have a picture?

23:06.323 --> 23:08.190
Not as of yet, sir.
Google Images was a blank

23:08.192 --> 23:10.292
and we're still waiting
for the DMV to come back to us.

23:10.294 --> 23:12.494
What about these lightbulbs?

23:12.496 --> 23:13.628
They are legitimately,

23:13.630 --> 23:15.731
uh, donated
by an electric company

23:15.733 --> 23:18.433
of Japan with U.S. offices
in Flemington, New Jersey

23:18.435 --> 23:20.135
as part of a charitable

23:20.137 --> 23:22.838
tax break for foreign companies
trading in the U.S.

23:22.840 --> 23:25.540
Do we have confirmation
of any monies distributed

23:25.542 --> 23:28.677
by this Local Hero Fund
to 9/11 families?

23:28.679 --> 23:30.145
Not yet, sir.

23:30.147 --> 23:31.513
To any families?

23:31.515 --> 23:33.915
To officers killed
in the line of duty?

23:33.917 --> 23:35.183
No, sir. Not yet.

23:35.185 --> 23:37.119
Why not?
Well, we can't

23:37.121 --> 23:39.087
run down paperwork
because the fund is,

23:39.089 --> 23:40.155
by their own admission,

23:40.157 --> 23:41.990
not licensed
by the city or state.

23:41.992 --> 23:43.625
Well, try doing it retail.

23:43.627 --> 23:45.994
I did, sir.
And?

23:45.996 --> 23:47.896
When I contacted a couple

23:47.898 --> 23:49.631
of survivors,
they just wanted to know,

23:49.633 --> 23:51.466
if they had gotten money

23:51.468 --> 23:52.934
from the Local Heroes Fund,

23:52.936 --> 23:54.703
would they have to give it back?

23:54.705 --> 23:57.806
Oh.

23:57.808 --> 24:00.175
Yeah.
Okay.

24:01.979 --> 24:04.265
Maybe we should run
her name through NLETS.

24:04.289 --> 24:05.381
NLETS?

24:05.382 --> 24:07.582
National Law Enforcement
Teletype Service.

24:07.584 --> 24:10.786
Uh, sometimes they have
Intel that NCIC does not.

24:10.788 --> 24:12.087
Teletype, sir?

24:12.089 --> 24:14.556
We haven't used teletype
for a very long time.

24:14.558 --> 24:16.158
I know that.

24:16.160 --> 24:18.260
The acronym's probably changed.

24:18.262 --> 24:19.961
Yes, sir.

24:19.963 --> 24:22.197
And stop looking at me
like I'm Captain Queeg

24:22.199 --> 24:24.299
asking where the
strawberries went.

24:24.301 --> 24:26.234
Sir?

24:26.236 --> 24:29.004
Never mind. What's next?

24:35.546 --> 24:37.279
Creepy crawling?
Are you serious?

24:37.281 --> 24:39.881
Well, we know your preferred
method of interaction is

24:39.883 --> 24:42.164
putting a slug through the back
of someone's brain, right?

24:43.220 --> 24:45.720
But, hey,
old dog, new tricks.

24:45.722 --> 24:47.322
I don't kill people,

24:47.324 --> 24:49.257
no matter what your sister says.

24:49.259 --> 24:51.893
So the FOD is just
a misunderstood civic group.

24:51.895 --> 24:54.529
Yeah. We have a toy ride
every year

24:54.531 --> 24:55.964
and a pancake breakfast

24:55.966 --> 24:57.265
for the nursing home
on our block.

24:57.267 --> 24:59.901
To distract the public
from meth dealing

24:59.903 --> 25:01.870
and beating up motorists,
like you did in Midtown

25:01.872 --> 25:03.004
last year.

25:03.006 --> 25:04.573
And last night,
sent out

25:04.575 --> 25:06.741
one of your goons
to assault an ADA

25:06.743 --> 25:08.643
as a warning to my sister.

25:08.645 --> 25:10.479
Says who?

25:10.481 --> 25:12.047
Says the FOD patch
he threw down,

25:12.049 --> 25:13.415
which matches the tat
on the back

25:13.417 --> 25:15.517
of your hand.

25:15.519 --> 25:17.853
Anybody can buy that patch.

25:17.855 --> 25:19.387
Doesn't mean they ride with us.

25:19.389 --> 25:20.755
Doesn't mean they don't.

25:20.757 --> 25:23.358
You're so smart? Prove it.

25:23.360 --> 25:25.160
I will.

25:25.162 --> 25:28.630
C.O., we're done here.

25:33.470 --> 25:35.537
Well, that was
a big, fat nothing.

25:35.539 --> 25:37.239
Spoke to gang Intel here.

25:37.241 --> 25:39.774
Vitale speaks to anyone,
we'll hear about it.

25:39.776 --> 25:42.711
(motorcycle rumbles)

25:42.713 --> 25:47.048
MEN (chanting):
FOD! FOD! FOD! FOD!

25:47.050 --> 25:49.050
FOD! FOD!

25:49.052 --> 25:52.988
FOD! FOD! FOD! FOD!

25:52.990 --> 25:55.957
Hey, how you doing,
hon, huh? Yeah.

25:55.959 --> 25:57.492
Let's get
another round.

25:57.494 --> 25:59.494
Thanks, cutie pie.
You're looking good.

25:59.496 --> 26:01.029
(music stops)

26:01.031 --> 26:02.964
DANNY:
Police.

26:02.966 --> 26:04.499
Who's the boss?

26:04.501 --> 26:05.934
Evening, Officer, and no,

26:05.936 --> 26:07.502
we don't know anything
about that lawyer

26:07.504 --> 26:08.970
who got attacked last night.

26:08.972 --> 26:10.772
Yeah, I didn't know
that made the news yet.

26:10.774 --> 26:12.641
You don't think
we can hear things?

26:12.643 --> 26:14.142
I'm sure you hear
lots of things.

26:14.144 --> 26:16.178
Tell me, then,
what I can do for you?

26:16.180 --> 26:18.046
I saw Jimmy Vitale earlier.

26:18.048 --> 26:20.615
A minute
after I left him,

26:20.617 --> 26:23.318
he used a stash phone
to text someone in this bar.

26:23.320 --> 26:24.586
A guy named Sully.

26:24.588 --> 26:26.755
Why don't you
point him out to me, okay?

26:27.524 --> 26:30.058
Sully went riding.
Yeah, yeah.

26:31.028 --> 26:32.327
All right,

26:32.329 --> 26:33.695
I'm gonna need to see some IDs

26:33.697 --> 26:35.430
unless someone wants
to make my life easier

26:35.432 --> 26:37.832
and tell me
where Sully is.

26:46.210 --> 26:47.709
Step aside.

26:47.711 --> 26:49.711
All right, step aside.

26:49.713 --> 26:52.180
Step back. Step back.

26:52.182 --> 26:54.516
Step back.

26:54.518 --> 26:56.585
Move it, Santa Claus.

26:56.587 --> 26:59.020
Come on.
Hey, Sully!

27:00.357 --> 27:01.957
Hey. Ah, ah.

27:01.959 --> 27:03.959
Oh!

27:03.961 --> 27:05.460
You going somewhere?

27:05.462 --> 27:08.029
He's going somewhere with us,
aren't you, Sully?

27:17.929 --> 27:20.530
Text from Vitale? I don't even
know what you're talking about.

27:20.532 --> 27:22.432
He sent it from Rikers

27:22.434 --> 27:23.666
to your number.

27:23.668 --> 27:25.935
Maybe he never learned to read.
Yeah.

27:25.937 --> 27:29.873
Maybe Sully needs a little
bit of a reading lesson.

27:29.875 --> 27:31.541
Ow.
Let's see if you can read that.

27:31.543 --> 27:33.910
Says “Keep up the good work.”
Can you read that?

27:33.912 --> 27:37.347
Fine. But I don't know
what that means.

27:37.349 --> 27:39.082
Yeah, I'm sure you don't.

27:39.084 --> 27:40.416
It's an attaboy for bashing in

27:40.418 --> 27:41.584
a girl's head to scare

27:41.586 --> 27:43.419
the deputy D.A. off his case.

27:43.421 --> 27:45.889
Except I didn't.

27:45.891 --> 27:49.459
Sully, it's well known you were
Vitale's right hand for years.

27:49.461 --> 27:51.694
He said “jump,”
you said “on who?”

27:51.696 --> 27:55.431
Maybe he <i> thinks</i> I did something
for him that I didn't do.

27:55.433 --> 27:57.967
Hell, I'm glad he got locked up.

27:57.969 --> 28:00.136
Because you can become
the king of the crankheads.

28:00.138 --> 28:02.839
Because he sucked as a boss.

28:02.841 --> 28:05.108
Last couple years,

28:05.110 --> 28:08.244
Vitale's been completely
out of control. He'll

28:08.246 --> 28:10.013
overload on crank and just go

28:10.015 --> 28:12.715
nuts on people for no
reason. He didn't even

28:12.717 --> 28:14.584
tell us he was gonna
try and ice the guy

28:14.586 --> 28:16.886
from the 6th Street Death Corps.
You got an

28:16.888 --> 28:18.454
alibi for last night, Sully?

28:18.456 --> 28:21.324
I was with my old lady, Liz.

28:21.326 --> 28:22.659
Oh, right, yeah,

28:22.661 --> 28:24.160
we saw her
on the security tapes,

28:24.162 --> 28:26.296
breaking into the
prosecutor's place.

28:26.298 --> 28:28.131
Around yea tall, blonde hair.

28:28.133 --> 28:30.266
No, Liz is a redhead.

28:30.268 --> 28:31.634
Well, must've been a wig.

28:31.636 --> 28:33.636
I'm sure we'll find it
when we find her.

28:33.638 --> 28:36.039
But she didn't
do anything either.

28:36.041 --> 28:38.675
I'm sure she didn't.

28:38.677 --> 28:40.410
Sayonara, Sully.

28:40.412 --> 28:43.513
Yo, I don't speak Spanish.

28:46.318 --> 28:49.385
And Grandpa could've just
busted her for false pretense

28:49.387 --> 28:52.088
or whatever the legal term
would be, but he didn't.

28:52.090 --> 28:54.023
He gave her
the benefit of the doubt.

28:54.025 --> 28:55.658
Really?
In the moment.

28:55.660 --> 28:56.960
I was very moved.

28:56.962 --> 28:58.661
Yeah, 'cause he let her
off the hook.

28:58.663 --> 28:59.996
No, because
he made the call

28:59.998 --> 29:01.931
from an optimistic place.
Mm.

29:01.933 --> 29:04.934
Where is that place, exactly?
Yeah, and is she pretty?

29:04.936 --> 29:06.936
I don't know.
Uh-huh.

29:06.938 --> 29:08.071
Completely beside the point.

29:08.073 --> 29:09.606
Exactly.
I'm all for

29:09.608 --> 29:10.773
benefit of the doubt,

29:10.775 --> 29:12.008
so long as I'm

29:12.010 --> 29:15.545
dead certain who benefits
from the doubt.

29:16.681 --> 29:18.915
What does that mean?
It means I want

29:18.917 --> 29:21.517
to be sure a person is innocent

29:21.519 --> 29:23.620
before I let him
or her off the hook.

29:23.622 --> 29:25.221
So you're all for
the benefit of the doubt

29:25.223 --> 29:26.556
as long as there
is no doubt.

29:26.558 --> 29:29.492
Exactly.
(laughs)

29:29.494 --> 29:31.894
You usually just know.

29:31.896 --> 29:33.963
DANNY: Know what?
If someone's

29:33.965 --> 29:35.732
trying to pull
something over on you.

29:35.734 --> 29:37.800
You know? The crux
of the matter is,

29:37.802 --> 29:39.435
who benefits
if I bust this person?

29:39.437 --> 29:40.870
Like?

29:40.872 --> 29:43.373
Like if a 300-pounder
comes in complaining

29:43.375 --> 29:44.841
of dizziness and shortness

29:44.843 --> 29:46.509
of breath but
swears he loves

29:46.511 --> 29:48.511
kale salad and doesn't smoke.

29:48.513 --> 29:49.579
So what do you do?

29:49.581 --> 29:50.880
I pretend to believe him

29:50.882 --> 29:52.682
with the hope that I might get
a little traction

29:52.684 --> 29:55.318
trust-wise, see?
So the next time

29:55.320 --> 29:56.586
he might listen to me.

29:56.588 --> 29:58.221
If there is a next time.

29:58.223 --> 29:59.322
Well, we do what we can.

29:59.324 --> 30:00.423
Could I have some of that for

30:00.425 --> 30:01.457
when my grades come out?

30:01.459 --> 30:03.092
No.
But we're your own kids.

30:03.094 --> 30:03.665
No.

30:03.689 --> 30:05.689
Jack, there is a difference
between being cynical

30:05.697 --> 30:07.864
and just plain naive.

30:07.866 --> 30:10.433
Don't think for a second
that some smart guy isn't gonna

30:10.435 --> 30:12.669
check out your story. Plan on it.
Well, did you

30:12.671 --> 30:13.903
check Ms. Vickers out?

30:13.905 --> 30:15.138
Of course I did.

30:15.140 --> 30:16.305
And?
And,

30:16.307 --> 30:18.508
so far, it confirms
what she told us.

30:18.510 --> 30:20.743
Now doesn't that
make you feel good?

30:22.547 --> 30:25.748
If I find a $20 bill
on the sidewalk it feels good.

30:25.750 --> 30:28.818
Doesn't mean I'm gonna
count on it to pay the bills.

30:28.820 --> 30:30.620
Yeah, but that's
not what I'm saying.

30:30.622 --> 30:33.423
If you give someone the
benefit of the doubt and it

30:33.425 --> 30:36.426
turns out well,
then that's a good thing.

30:36.428 --> 30:39.262
Especially for someone
like you, right?

30:39.264 --> 30:40.496
Right.

30:42.300 --> 30:44.267
Okay, so say it
like you mean it.

30:46.871 --> 30:49.605
Nicky, you're right.
It feels just great.

30:51.309 --> 30:52.375
(clears throat)

30:52.377 --> 30:54.711
(all laughing)

30:58.650 --> 31:01.751
Hey, you ready
to get to it, shorty?

31:01.753 --> 31:03.820
I found Beth's niece.

31:03.822 --> 31:05.388
What? How?

31:05.390 --> 31:07.857
Figured she was a little
confused about the uniform.

31:07.859 --> 31:10.760
And, uh, turns
out Meg Behar

31:10.762 --> 31:13.663
was a carrier for
the post office.

31:13.665 --> 31:15.431
But she didn't
run off.

31:15.433 --> 31:17.633
She died of cancer
two years ago.

31:17.635 --> 31:19.135
In that apartment.

31:19.137 --> 31:20.636
Damn.

31:20.638 --> 31:22.138
Reagan. Janko.

31:22.140 --> 31:23.773
Let me guess,

31:23.775 --> 31:26.709
John Johanssen is a figment
of Beth's imagination.

31:26.711 --> 31:28.544
Nope, a disgruntled pipefitter.

31:28.546 --> 31:29.946
Local 242 canned him

31:29.948 --> 31:31.914
for drinking on the
job, but he blames it

31:31.916 --> 31:34.851
on their diversity program
and wants revenge.

31:35.687 --> 31:37.787
You put the union on alert?

31:37.789 --> 31:39.055
Every office and every leader.

31:39.057 --> 31:40.657
But there is a meeting
happening Midtown,

31:40.658 --> 31:43.392
and no one's answering
their damn phone. So let's go.

31:43.394 --> 31:46.229
What, r-really, us?

31:46.231 --> 31:48.164
Hey, you guys broke the case.

31:48.166 --> 31:50.366
Let's go.

31:52.270 --> 31:54.470
(siren wails)

31:55.273 --> 31:56.906
Got your message, Doc.
How's Morgan?

31:56.908 --> 31:59.675
Well, she has a concussion,
subdural hematoma.

31:59.677 --> 32:02.111
We thought she might not wake
up until she started talking.

32:02.113 --> 32:03.222
What'd she say?

32:03.247 --> 32:05.349
She asked me to call Ms.
Reagan, but she's in court.

32:05.350 --> 32:07.416
Figured you were the next best thing.
Good call.

32:07.418 --> 32:09.652
Where is she?
Room on the right.

32:14.159 --> 32:15.758
Morgan.

32:15.760 --> 32:17.727
Detective Reagan.
I'm Erin's brother.

32:17.729 --> 32:21.097
I wanted you to know we got
the guy who did this to you.

32:21.099 --> 32:22.498
You're
safe now.

32:22.500 --> 32:24.801
No, that's not him.

32:25.670 --> 32:27.837
What do you mean that's not him?

32:27.839 --> 32:30.072
The guy who attacked me
had, um...

32:30.074 --> 32:32.408
a neck tattoo.

32:32.410 --> 32:34.410
A coffin with “DC”
in the middle.

32:34.412 --> 32:37.013
That's 6th Street Death Corps.
You sure?

32:37.015 --> 32:38.881
Yes.

32:39.717 --> 32:42.485
Okay. Okay.

32:44.522 --> 32:45.588
Erin.

32:45.590 --> 32:46.823
Perfect timing. I just set

32:46.825 --> 32:48.724
the trial date for Jimmy Vitale.

32:48.726 --> 32:51.327
Great, except it's not his guys
that are after you.

32:51.329 --> 32:52.685
How do you know that?

32:52.710 --> 32:54.165
Because Morgan just told me
the guy who attacked her

32:54.165 --> 32:56.899
in the elevator had
a Death Corps tat on his neck.

32:56.901 --> 33:00.636
Their leader is the one Jimmy
Vitale was trying to take out.

33:00.638 --> 33:01.771
With Vitale on the ropes,

33:01.773 --> 33:04.006
they-they must be coming
after you

33:04.008 --> 33:06.375
and trying to frame FOD for it,

33:06.377 --> 33:09.512
to put them out of business for good.
(rumbling)

33:09.514 --> 33:10.713
Erin?

33:10.715 --> 33:12.348
Danny, there are some guys
behind me.

33:12.350 --> 33:14.650
I don't know if they're
Death Corps or not, but...

33:14.652 --> 33:16.419
Y-Your driver,
is he one of ours?

33:16.421 --> 33:17.720
Yeah.
Great. Then have him take evasive action

33:17.722 --> 33:19.522
and get you to my squad room
right away.

33:19.524 --> 33:20.723
I'll meet you there.

33:20.725 --> 33:23.092
Got it. We're not gonna go back
to my office.

33:23.094 --> 33:24.460
We're gonna go to the 5-4.

33:24.462 --> 33:27.196
And can you keep an eye
on the guys behind us?

33:39.873 --> 33:42.106
(siren wailing)

33:42.108 --> 33:44.609
Hey! Where's the
union meeting?

33:44.611 --> 33:46.010
That way. Up the stairs.
Outside.

33:46.012 --> 33:47.946
Get outside right now.
Okay, everybody get outside, please.

33:47.948 --> 33:48.913
(overlapping chatter)

33:48.915 --> 33:50.348
Don't ask questions!
Just go!

33:50.350 --> 33:52.216
Hey!
Come on, get out of here!

33:52.218 --> 33:53.284
Move, let's go!

33:53.286 --> 33:54.919
Outside.
Outside.

33:54.921 --> 33:57.789
MAN: All right, folks,
take your seats.

33:57.791 --> 34:00.124
We got a lot on the agenda today.
Police!

34:00.126 --> 34:01.960
Everyone out! Now.
Outside now.

34:01.962 --> 34:03.161
There could be a bomb! Outside!

34:03.163 --> 34:05.263
Move now! Let's go!
Everybody out!

34:05.265 --> 34:07.498
Everyone out! Let's go.
Move!

34:07.500 --> 34:09.467
Sir.
(indistinct shouting)

34:09.469 --> 34:11.536
Hey, hey.

34:11.538 --> 34:13.438
That's the guy, that's the guy.

34:13.440 --> 34:15.773
Police!

34:15.775 --> 34:17.775
John Johanssen,
hold it right there!

34:17.777 --> 34:19.944
Stay
where you are!

34:19.946 --> 34:22.246
Police!

34:22.248 --> 34:25.449
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
We'll all go up.

34:25.452 --> 34:27.819
Take it easy, Johanssen.
Take it easy.

34:27.821 --> 34:29.420
All right,
just take it easy.

34:29.422 --> 34:30.822
Put it down.

34:30.824 --> 34:32.389
(crying)

34:33.393 --> 34:34.458
Put it down, John.

34:34.460 --> 34:38.129
You people made me do this!

34:38.130 --> 34:39.230
You women.

34:40.667 --> 34:42.467
Blacks!

34:46.438 --> 34:49.206
Everybody's taking my job!

34:49.208 --> 34:51.208
Just put it down, John.

34:53.413 --> 34:55.733
Take it easy, John. Just put
it down. We can talk about it.

35:00.053 --> 35:02.186
(beeping)

35:03.156 --> 35:04.589
You people deserve this.

35:04.591 --> 35:08.126
You all
deserve this.

35:10.497 --> 35:12.196
(gunshot)

35:17.570 --> 35:19.937
All right,
everybody out!

35:19.939 --> 35:23.708
Everyone, get out! Go! Go!
Let's go! Move!

35:24.544 --> 35:26.844
Nice shooting, Reagan.

35:28.281 --> 35:31.049
I may not be one of “you people"
but I know crap when I hear it.

35:31.051 --> 35:32.750
You just saved a lot of lives.

35:32.752 --> 35:34.152
Let's get out of here
before that thing goes off.

35:34.154 --> 35:37.422
You got it. 10-4.
Eddie, come on.

35:41.361 --> 35:43.294
Those Death Corps bikers
followed you the whole way?

35:43.296 --> 35:45.029
Yeah, until they saw us
pulling up here.

35:45.031 --> 35:46.731
It was a tough
couple minutes.

35:46.733 --> 35:48.866
Yeah. Well, you're safe now.

35:48.868 --> 35:52.704
Morgan ID'd senior member of
the Death Corps, Jerry Biondi,

35:52.706 --> 35:54.238
as her attacker in the elevator.

35:54.240 --> 35:56.941
His girlfriend, Sabrina
Loveless, matches the woman

35:56.943 --> 35:59.377
outside ADA Reagan's building.

35:59.379 --> 36:01.412
Copy that.
Let's do this.

36:01.414 --> 36:03.381
Come on, guys. Let's move out.

36:03.383 --> 36:05.416
You ready?

36:05.418 --> 36:07.185
I'm ready.
Be careful.

36:17.197 --> 36:19.363
(siren wailing)

36:26.473 --> 36:28.673
Police! Everyone down!

36:30.944 --> 36:32.443
What are we waiting for?

36:32.445 --> 36:35.413
These Death Corps guys
are a bunch of rats.

36:35.415 --> 36:38.149
Rats always run.

36:44.824 --> 36:47.125
(siren wailing)

36:47.127 --> 36:49.127
(tires screeching)

36:54.234 --> 36:55.700
Oh!

36:59.405 --> 37:00.838
(horn honking)

37:00.840 --> 37:02.840
(tires screeching)

37:05.779 --> 37:07.512
Get down!

37:08.748 --> 37:09.413
Gun!
Oh...

37:09.415 --> 37:10.915
(gunshots)

37:27.801 --> 37:30.168
(horn honking)

37:32.539 --> 37:33.539
Hang on.

37:34.007 --> 37:35.007
(tires screech)

37:38.311 --> 37:39.911
You okay?
Yeah.

37:39.913 --> 37:42.113
Police! Get your hands
where I can see 'em!

37:44.050 --> 37:46.184
You got her?

37:46.186 --> 37:47.852
Yeah.

37:47.854 --> 37:48.719
(grunts)

37:48.721 --> 37:50.388
That's for shooting at us.

37:50.390 --> 37:53.791
(grunts)
That's for messing with my sister.

37:55.695 --> 37:58.830
(handcuffs clicking)

37:58.832 --> 38:01.999
BETH: <i>Please tell me you're okay.</i>
<i>I saw on the TV</i>

38:02.001 --> 38:05.837
about JJ trying
to kill those people.

38:05.839 --> 38:08.439
Yeah, we were lucky that
bomb didn't go off.

38:08.441 --> 38:11.843
But, listen, uh,
Beth, you and I need to talk.

38:11.845 --> 38:13.878
About what?

38:13.880 --> 38:16.314
About your niece.

38:16.316 --> 38:20.318
Sweetie, all that matters
is you're back.

38:22.388 --> 38:25.823
You're back home.

38:31.130 --> 38:32.730
Well, you know, I just...

38:32.732 --> 38:35.566
I wanted to make sure that you
have my right phone number.

38:35.568 --> 38:38.769
So that... you can call me
whenever you want.

38:38.771 --> 38:41.105
Let me go
get my phone,

38:41.107 --> 38:44.175
and you can put your number
in it for me.

38:44.177 --> 38:47.678
And then I'll make us
something to eat.

38:49.482 --> 38:51.449
Oh, man.

38:51.451 --> 38:53.885
You're really gonna give
her your phone number?

38:53.887 --> 38:57.889
Let's see what she makes us
to eat first.

39:04.597 --> 39:06.764
(siren wailing)

39:19.779 --> 39:22.914
Elise Wickfield.

39:22.916 --> 39:26.150
My name is Lauren Vickers.

39:26.953 --> 39:30.221
Also Christy Walker
and Anne Ross

39:30.223 --> 39:32.957
and Terry Harris.
But you were born

39:32.959 --> 39:35.159
Elise Wickfield.

39:35.161 --> 39:38.696
And I am placing you
under arrest in that name

39:38.698 --> 39:40.498
on charges of fraud,

39:40.500 --> 39:43.100
enterprise corruption,

39:43.102 --> 39:45.670
and criminal impersonation...
Commissioner, this is...

39:45.672 --> 39:46.837
with active warrants

39:46.839 --> 39:49.974
in Baltimore,

39:49.976 --> 39:53.077
Atlanta,
and Fort Lauderdale.

39:53.079 --> 39:57.548
All three police departments
have confirmed

39:57.550 --> 40:00.251
their intent to extradite you
on those charges,

40:00.253 --> 40:03.654
so New York will have
to get in line.

40:08.061 --> 40:09.794
You know,

40:09.796 --> 40:12.029
there are days when I think--

40:12.031 --> 40:16.534
and not in a good way--
now I've seen everything.

40:16.536 --> 40:19.537
And then I come
across someone like you,

40:19.539 --> 40:20.938
and I think--

40:20.940 --> 40:22.807
and in the worst way--

40:22.809 --> 40:26.510
nah, you ain't seen nothing yet.

40:30.717 --> 40:33.751
9/11?

40:33.753 --> 40:35.920
Really?

40:37.657 --> 40:39.590
Remove your gloves,

40:39.592 --> 40:41.625
turn around and place your
hands behind your back.

40:41.627 --> 40:43.027
You have the right
to remain silent.
