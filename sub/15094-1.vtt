03:42.514 --> 03:44.482
Can I have some money?

03:47.769 --> 03:49.191
I said, “Can I have some money?"

03:49.396 --> 03:52.650
Kid, how many times do I have to tell you?
I don't have money.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.704
With a car like this?

03:57.904 --> 04:00.532
Do you know how many days
I worked to buy this car?

04:01.324 --> 04:04.294
- Whose cat is that?
- It's mine.

04:06.204 --> 04:08.332
2,191 days.

04:37.986 --> 04:40.455
<i>Dearest ladies with families...</i>

04:41.740 --> 04:44.163
<i>you care for your households,</i>

04:44.493 --> 04:46.336
<i>you care for your children,</i>

04:47.120 --> 04:48.747
<i>your husbands.</i>

04:49.873 --> 04:53.377
<i>And your husband brings home the money.</i>

04:54.669 --> 04:56.262
<i>Congratulations.</i>

04:57.005 --> 04:58.757
<i>But be prepared.</i>

04:58.965 --> 05:01.935
<i>One day, everything changes.</i>

05:02.135 --> 05:04.354
<i>Your husband leaves you,</i>

05:04.554 --> 05:06.602
<i>finds himself a new wife.</i>

05:06.807 --> 05:09.856
<i>A different woman, a younger woman.</i>

05:10.060 --> 05:11.528
<i>Or perhaps.</i>

05:11.728 --> 05:15.574
<i>Your husband has a stroke and dies.</i>

05:17.067 --> 05:18.819
<i>These things happen.</i>

05:25.492 --> 05:27.460
What's with you?
Open the door.

05:39.214 --> 05:42.093
<i>Don't count the
things you've lost.</i>

05:42.509 --> 05:45.513
<i>Let's count what's still left.</i>

05:56.565 --> 05:58.317
Look, Hossein,

05:58.525 --> 06:00.493
I help you, don't I?

06:02.195 --> 06:04.789
I give, you take.

06:07.701 --> 06:10.124
Does that seem right to you?

06:10.996 --> 06:12.873
I swear to God...

06:14.207 --> 06:17.711
on my mother's grave, I'll pay you.

06:19.963 --> 06:21.931
Are you a junkie?

06:23.341 --> 06:25.093
Answer me.

06:25.302 --> 06:27.771
I'm sick, I'm sick.

06:27.971 --> 06:29.689
You're a junkie.

06:31.099 --> 06:32.567
Your promises mean nothing.

06:32.767 --> 06:34.940
Who made him a junkie?

06:57.000 --> 06:59.378
What's your cat's name?

07:02.297 --> 07:04.425
Is it a boy or girl?

07:16.102 --> 07:18.730
Mr. Cat!
Mr. Cat!

07:19.439 --> 07:21.157
He's really fun.

07:22.984 --> 07:24.736
He's really fun.

07:38.875 --> 07:43.551
Look, your father is a normal man.

07:45.340 --> 07:49.186
Gambler, enjoys women.

07:49.386 --> 07:51.639
Takes medicine for his pain.

07:51.846 --> 07:53.644
You see?

07:54.557 --> 07:57.231
Completely normal. All right?

07:59.270 --> 08:04.527
However, the things your father likes,
he can't afford.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.823
Right?

08:14.703 --> 08:16.000
No.

08:16.538 --> 08:18.711
It's my car, not his.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.804
Do you even realize
how much your father owes me?

08:25.005 --> 08:27.133
I gave you money last week.

08:29.926 --> 08:32.020
Business is business.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.387
Hello?

10:34.843 --> 10:36.516
Come up here.

10:36.719 --> 10:38.266
I need you.

10:41.391 --> 10:43.985
I want to get really wasted.

10:46.271 --> 10:49.070
We'll tell Omid to drive.

10:57.115 --> 11:00.494
I don't get it.
Why do they keep having costume parties?

11:01.202 --> 11:02.624
Seriously.

11:06.791 --> 11:08.964
So what are you going to wear?

11:21.723 --> 11:23.600
Excuse me, Miss Shaydah?

11:25.935 --> 11:27.858
I'm sorry, Miss Shaydah?

11:29.105 --> 11:33.576
Sorry to bother you,
but this is going to take some time to fix.

11:35.153 --> 11:36.871
Go ahead.

11:37.655 --> 11:42.035
Then do you mind
leaving me alone in here to work on this?

11:43.745 --> 11:45.372
What for?

11:45.955 --> 11:48.504
Your mother and father.

11:49.667 --> 11:51.544
I'll call you right back.

11:52.462 --> 11:54.590
My mother and father?

11:54.797 --> 11:58.597
What if they knew you were alone
with a boy in your bedroom?

11:59.344 --> 12:02.268
- Are you serious?
- It's inappropriate.

12:11.272 --> 12:13.695
What a gentleman.

12:15.944 --> 12:18.117
My knees are weak.

12:50.645 --> 12:52.864
See my car?

13:01.281 --> 13:03.500
Well, get in.

13:49.871 --> 13:52.715
- How old are you now, Atti?
- Give me my cut.

13:53.624 --> 13:55.342
Take it easy.

13:56.210 --> 13:57.803
Come on, how old are you?

14:00.214 --> 14:02.842
- Thirty.
- Thirty.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.848
You're getting old.

14:09.891 --> 14:12.019
Don't you want kids?

14:24.447 --> 14:26.950
Women want kids, don't they?

15:51.159 --> 15:52.536
Get out.

15:52.743 --> 15:54.245
- I want my cut.
- You're light.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.172
- Give me my cut.
- Get out.

15:56.372 --> 15:59.421
- I'm not light.
- You think I'm joking?

16:07.258 --> 16:10.478
Get out!
Get out of here!

16:12.930 --> 16:15.558
Next time you focus on your job.

16:15.766 --> 16:17.018
Understand?

16:17.226 --> 16:19.320
And quit your crying.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.564
Hag!

19:25.039 --> 19:26.586
Now what?

19:37.426 --> 19:39.019
Come on.

22:34.728 --> 22:36.401
Want a line?

26:10.611 --> 26:12.864
<i>Leave a message, hooker.</i>

26:13.072 --> 26:17.122
It's Arash, I'm outside.
I've got something for you.

26:17.326 --> 26:19.749
Look, I want my car.

28:42.763 --> 28:45.266
I should die and leave you in peace.

28:47.684 --> 28:50.107
Here, drink some water first.

29:08.288 --> 29:10.336
You know what would hit the spot?

29:12.209 --> 29:14.382
Driving in a convertible.

29:16.964 --> 29:19.308
What fun we'd have.

32:49.593 --> 32:51.436
For God's sake,

32:51.720 --> 32:55.020
let's talk for a minute.

32:55.223 --> 32:57.351
You don't talk to me.

32:57.559 --> 32:59.937
You don't look at me.

33:00.812 --> 33:02.780
How much have I given you?

33:02.981 --> 33:04.733
Should I add it up?

33:04.941 --> 33:06.659
What do you want, Hossein?

33:08.695 --> 33:12.666
Let's talk a little,
be close to each other.

33:12.866 --> 33:16.211
When you find some money,
come find me.

33:16.411 --> 33:17.833
All right?

33:30.300 --> 33:32.098
Blind cat.

36:49.499 --> 36:51.376
Are you a good boy?

36:57.048 --> 36:58.800
Answer me.

36:59.676 --> 37:02.054
Are you a good boy or not?

37:03.054 --> 37:04.226
Yes.

37:15.442 --> 37:17.069
Don't lie.

37:18.278 --> 37:20.622
Are you a good boy?

37:22.407 --> 37:23.499
Yes.

37:26.453 --> 37:28.876
I'll ask you one more time.

37:29.956 --> 37:31.799
Tell the truth.

37:32.250 --> 37:35.049
Are you a good boy?

37:46.181 --> 37:53.941
I can take your eyes
out of your skull

37:54.647 --> 37:57.196
and give them to dogs to eat.

38:01.905 --> 38:06.911
Till the end of your life,

38:07.118 --> 38:08.870
I'll be watching you.

38:10.830 --> 38:12.673
Understand?

38:12.874 --> 38:13.874
Yes.

38:18.505 --> 38:20.348
Be a good boy.

39:27.991 --> 39:29.709
Dad...

39:30.743 --> 39:32.040
I brought you soup.

39:34.247 --> 39:36.090
What do I want soup for?

39:36.291 --> 39:39.921
Don't you see me?
Do you see me here?

39:40.128 --> 39:42.426
Where's your loyalty?

39:42.630 --> 39:44.758
I'm sick. Sick!

39:44.966 --> 39:46.764
I need my medicine!

39:49.596 --> 39:53.897
His father is lying here like this,
and he's only thinking of himself.

41:18.851 --> 41:21.821
Arash, look at you.

41:22.939 --> 41:24.156
This is Shirin.

41:24.357 --> 41:25.483
Hey.

41:25.692 --> 41:28.070
Listen, we heard you have X.

41:28.277 --> 41:30.700
Our friend told us to find Dracula.

41:34.534 --> 41:35.911
It's on me.

41:36.119 --> 41:37.917
Really?

41:38.705 --> 41:40.799
To your health.

41:59.350 --> 42:01.523
Your costume is really fun.

42:02.061 --> 42:05.156
- Are you scared?
- Very scared.

42:05.356 --> 42:07.779
And you?
Are you scared?

42:14.532 --> 42:16.205
So this is your new job?

42:21.289 --> 42:23.917
- Give me another one.
- One is enough.

42:24.125 --> 42:26.753
- Give it.
- One is enough.

42:39.348 --> 42:41.442
Open your mouth.

42:43.394 --> 42:45.192
Are you scared?

42:46.522 --> 42:50.652
This pill is nothing without you.

42:50.860 --> 42:52.828
It needs you.

44:29.542 --> 44:30.759
Arash!

44:47.059 --> 44:49.278
Look how chic he is now.

45:06.704 --> 45:10.299
Arash, are you okay?

45:14.921 --> 45:16.389
Arash?

45:17.089 --> 45:18.432
Arash?

47:12.496 --> 47:14.715
I'm lost.

47:16.584 --> 47:18.461
Where are we?

47:21.380 --> 47:22.927
Bad City.

47:33.976 --> 47:35.398
Bad City?

47:38.814 --> 47:41.408
I live in Bad City.

47:44.945 --> 47:47.664
This doesn't look like Bad City.

47:50.618 --> 47:52.211
Does it?

47:58.209 --> 48:00.132
It's not familiar.

48:13.808 --> 48:16.106
I'm Dracula.

48:22.942 --> 48:25.365
Don't worry, I won't hurt you.

48:41.168 --> 48:43.466
Can I ask you something?

48:44.880 --> 48:46.723
Why are you here?

48:56.183 --> 48:58.106
Both of us -

48:59.103 --> 49:01.105
Both of us are here.

49:12.783 --> 49:15.411
I've never felt like this before.

49:19.582 --> 49:21.334
Give me your hand.

49:22.751 --> 49:24.879
You're so cold.

49:45.816 --> 49:47.489
Let's sit.

49:52.531 --> 49:54.829
You can't sit here.

50:02.750 --> 50:05.503
My house is near here.

50:06.879 --> 50:09.177
You can sit there.

50:25.648 --> 50:28.401
I can't,
I have to sit.

57:02.753 --> 57:04.096
What's with you?

57:04.504 --> 57:06.802
You look funny.

57:08.800 --> 57:10.643
I'm tired.

57:12.846 --> 57:14.814
Yes, I can see that.

57:16.350 --> 57:19.024
Where were you in
the middle of the night?

57:20.604 --> 57:21.821
With a girl.

57:24.483 --> 57:26.451
What girl?

57:33.992 --> 57:36.040
I don't know her name.

57:37.371 --> 57:39.669
You don't know her name.

57:39.873 --> 57:41.796
Who's her family?

57:43.961 --> 57:45.008
I don't know.

57:47.381 --> 57:49.975
“I don't know, I don't know."

57:50.175 --> 57:53.395
Are you an idiot now?
Have you become an idiot?

57:56.682 --> 58:00.437
Yep, he's an idiot.

58:04.690 --> 58:07.068
Congratulations, handsome.

59:44.456 --> 59:46.584
Why are you following me?

59:51.838 --> 59:53.340
What do you want?

01:00:13.985 --> 01:00:15.953
Where did you get this?

01:00:21.827 --> 01:00:25.923
Girl, where did you get this?

01:00:43.723 --> 01:00:45.396
Have one.

01:00:46.476 --> 01:00:48.069
They're sweet.

01:00:57.279 --> 01:00:59.498
What are you
following me around for?

01:00:59.698 --> 01:01:01.621
Are you religious or something?

01:01:01.825 --> 01:01:03.202
No.

01:01:03.743 --> 01:01:06.121
Look who found her tongue.

01:01:08.748 --> 01:01:11.092
You want to do what I do?

01:01:11.877 --> 01:01:13.504
It's not easy.

01:01:15.797 --> 01:01:18.892
If that's why you're following me around,
I'm not a teacher.

01:01:19.092 --> 01:01:21.811
You don't like what you do.

01:01:25.807 --> 01:01:27.775
You're watching me?

01:01:33.481 --> 01:01:35.324
At night.

01:01:38.403 --> 01:01:39.825
So...

01:01:41.406 --> 01:01:45.832
what did you see
all this time watching me?

01:01:48.955 --> 01:01:50.832
You're sad.

01:01:53.418 --> 01:01:55.637
You don't remember what you want.

01:01:57.839 --> 01:02:00.308
You don't remember wanting.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:04.138
It passed long ago.

01:02:07.599 --> 01:02:09.977
And nothing ever changes.

01:02:19.819 --> 01:02:22.242
Idiots and rich people

01:02:23.073 --> 01:02:26.498
are the only ones who think
things can change.

01:02:31.581 --> 01:02:34.300
You're saving your money.

01:02:35.752 --> 01:02:37.345
For what?

01:02:39.756 --> 01:02:41.508
Are you a thief?

01:02:43.134 --> 01:02:44.260
No.

01:02:45.428 --> 01:02:47.351
So what are you?

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:13.142
MEET ME AT THE POWER PLANT
TOMORROW AT 10:00 P.M. - DRACULA

01:05:50.155 --> 01:05:51.953
Are you hungry?

01:05:56.661 --> 01:05:58.834
I brought you a hamburger.

01:06:34.407 --> 01:06:36.284
You don't like hamburgers?

01:06:43.082 --> 01:06:46.507
I never met someone
who didn't like hamburgers.

01:06:52.050 --> 01:06:53.893
I don't know your name.

01:06:55.595 --> 01:06:57.347
You don't know me.

01:06:58.598 --> 01:07:00.600
Obviously. We just met.

01:07:07.232 --> 01:07:09.701
What was the last
song you listened to?

01:07:17.325 --> 01:07:19.123
“Hello, " “Hello."

01:07:20.745 --> 01:07:22.497
Lionel Richie.

01:07:23.373 --> 01:07:25.046
Sad.

01:07:26.918 --> 01:07:29.671
Sad songs hit the spot, don't they?

01:08:22.223 --> 01:08:24.600
I know something else about you.

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:43.078
Your ears aren't pierced.

01:08:57.341 --> 01:08:58.935
They're pretty.

01:09:01.011 --> 01:09:02.559
They're for you.

01:09:04.307 --> 01:09:06.604
Too bad you can't wear them.

01:09:21.573 --> 01:09:23.247
Seriously?

01:09:47.684 --> 01:09:49.185
Are you sure?

01:10:01.197 --> 01:10:02.619
Did it hurt?

01:10:13.376 --> 01:10:15.925
- You don't have to.
- Do the other one.

01:10:16.129 --> 01:10:18.052
- Forget it.
- Do it.

01:10:28.099 --> 01:10:29.567
It's done.

01:10:45.992 --> 01:10:48.211
What lucky earrings.

01:11:04.051 --> 01:11:06.019
I've done bad things.

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:11.267
I'm bad.

01:11:13.186 --> 01:11:14.529
Obviously.

01:11:15.646 --> 01:11:17.944
You don't know the things I've done.

01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:22.154
And you don't know the things I've done.

01:11:38.836 --> 01:11:40.930
If there was a storm coming right now,

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:44.350
a big storm, from behind those mountains,

01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:46.427
would it matter?

01:11:49.764 --> 01:11:51.687
Would it change anything?

01:13:31.824 --> 01:13:35.249
Did you come here to watch me?

01:13:38.205 --> 01:13:40.299
Are you watching me?

01:13:43.002 --> 01:13:45.096
What do you want?

01:13:45.463 --> 01:13:46.715
What?

01:13:50.092 --> 01:13:52.311
What?
What do you want?

01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:04.573
You're still torturing me?

01:14:04.774 --> 01:14:08.153
You left me here alone.
Now you're back again.

01:14:20.456 --> 01:14:22.379
What the hell do
you want from me?

01:14:22.583 --> 01:14:25.132
Leave me alone!
You ruined me!

01:14:28.714 --> 01:14:31.183
This is the life you left me!

01:14:31.384 --> 01:14:33.102
Leave me alone!

01:14:35.972 --> 01:14:37.690
What the hell do
you want from me?

01:14:37.890 --> 01:14:39.563
What are you doing?

01:14:40.434 --> 01:14:41.936
Come here, look.

01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:44.613
Look at its eyes.
It's your mother.

01:14:44.814 --> 01:14:47.658
- Have you lost your mind?
- Do you see its eyes?

01:14:48.234 --> 01:14:49.952
It's your mother. Look, look.

01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:52.534
Look at this place.

01:14:52.738 --> 01:14:54.786
Why do you do this?

01:14:55.157 --> 01:14:58.502
Can you tell me?
How much of this am I supposed to take?

01:14:58.703 --> 01:15:01.752
- What do you want me to do?
- You're supposed to be my father!

01:15:10.464 --> 01:15:13.434
I don't even know
what I'm doing anymore.

01:15:13.634 --> 01:15:17.264
I don't know what
I'm doing anymore!

01:15:17.471 --> 01:15:19.690
You want your medicine?

01:15:21.892 --> 01:15:23.189
Here.

01:15:29.066 --> 01:15:31.945
Take it and get out of this house.

01:15:36.032 --> 01:15:39.377
Take it and leave this house,
and don't come back.

01:15:41.787 --> 01:15:44.256
Take the cat with you.
I don't want it anymore.

01:17:07.498 --> 01:17:09.796
I want you to dance for me...

01:17:13.504 --> 01:17:15.472
like the old days.

01:17:19.009 --> 01:17:20.682
I want -

01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:23.643
I want to watch you.

01:18:41.634 --> 01:18:44.934
Atti, sweetheart...

01:18:46.722 --> 01:18:48.565
come here.

01:18:50.935 --> 01:18:53.358
Let's be together.

01:18:54.939 --> 01:18:56.657
Sit right here.

01:18:56.857 --> 01:18:58.279
Let's have a good time.

01:18:58.859 --> 01:19:00.861
No, I don't want to.

01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:03.243
I said I don't want to, Hossein.
I don't want to.

01:19:05.074 --> 01:19:07.247
Atti, sit down.

01:19:07.743 --> 01:19:09.791
I said, “Sit down."

01:19:12.414 --> 01:19:14.837
We're going to have a good time.

01:19:15.042 --> 01:19:17.136
I said, “I don't want to."
Do you hear me?

01:19:17.336 --> 01:19:19.589
Let's have a good time.

01:19:20.172 --> 01:19:22.516
Do you hear me, Hossein?

01:19:24.218 --> 01:19:26.437
We're going to have
a good time together.

01:22:58.974 --> 01:23:00.476
Let's go.

01:23:13.822 --> 01:23:15.699
You have to leave.

01:23:20.746 --> 01:23:22.999
Take that thing with you.

01:25:28.999 --> 01:25:31.843
Boy, if you saw something,
you have to tell me.

01:25:32.044 --> 01:25:33.044
Understand?

01:25:35.672 --> 01:25:37.674
- Did you see something?
- No.

01:25:37.883 --> 01:25:39.851
Did you see someone?

01:25:40.052 --> 01:25:41.052
No.

01:25:41.511 --> 01:25:43.513
Did you see someone?

01:25:43.722 --> 01:25:46.100
- Who was it?
- I don't know.

01:25:46.308 --> 01:25:47.525
Who was it?

01:25:47.726 --> 01:25:49.399
What do you mean, you don't know?

01:25:49.603 --> 01:25:51.230
Who was it?

01:25:52.731 --> 01:25:54.028
I don't know.

01:28:33.767 --> 01:28:35.565
We have to go.

01:28:40.148 --> 01:28:42.071
Pack your things.

01:28:45.862 --> 01:28:47.489
Do you have a bag?

01:28:55.664 --> 01:28:57.507
Look, I can't stay here.

01:28:59.709 --> 01:29:02.007
We'll get in my car and go.

01:29:04.506 --> 01:29:06.224
Let's leave Bad City.

01:29:15.809 --> 01:29:17.652
Come with me.

01:29:21.982 --> 01:29:24.531
Don't leave me.
Don't leave me alone.
