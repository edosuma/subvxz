you on the El train

it's fucking stupid,

10:13.820 --> 10:15.355

10:15.356 --> 10:17.226
Are you gonna go back?

10:17.227 --> 10:19.757

me finish cleaning my junk?

10:21.702 --> 10:24.106

what to do all the time.

for the rest of my life?

10:37.534 --> 10:39.103
I signed up for junior college.

left I could get dressed

10:59.544 --> 11:00.807
so I wouldn't be late.

11:04.187 --> 11:06.023
- Welding, huh?
- Yeah.

arc, tungsten, mig, tig.

I deposited the check.

11:35.349 --> 11:36.651
Although I took a picture of it first

11:36.652 --> 11:38.154
so I can put it on my wall.

11:38.155 --> 11:39.958
Feel good paying off the mortgage?

11:39.959 --> 11:41.661
I didn't think you guys were gonna

11:41.662 --> 11:43.164
tear the place apart so soon.

11:43.165 --> 11:44.533
We're hosting happy hour.

11:44.534 --> 11:46.604
Workers start the remodel tomorrow.

11:46.605 --> 11:48.809
- Happy hour?
- Mm.

11:48.810 --> 11:50.245
South Side Young Professionals.

11:50.246 --> 11:52.449
(ETTA) <i>Get your hands off my washer!</i>

11:52.450 --> 11:55.055
- (GROANS)
- Thief!

11:55.056 --> 11:56.490
Guessing you didn't tell her yet.

11:56.491 --> 11:58.394
No, I did. A couple of times.

11:58.395 --> 11:59.965
She's got no short-term memory.

11:59.966 --> 12:01.835
(MAN) <i>Lady, stop, please. I gotta work.</i>

12:01.836 --> 12:04.975
It's not easy ripping someone
from their home of 50 years.

12:04.976 --> 12:06.684
You get used to it.

12:09.084 --> 12:11.520
(MAN) <i>Come on. Come on.</i>

12:11.521 --> 12:15.161
- You silly ass.
- Jesus, lady!

12:15.162 --> 12:16.764
Okay, Etta, Etta, calm down.

12:16.765 --> 12:18.936
Call the police. They're
taking everything.

12:18.937 --> 12:20.472
I know, I know. Come on, let's sit down.

12:20.473 --> 12:22.309
What the hell's going on?

12:22.310 --> 12:25.715
We talked about this
yesterday and last night.

12:25.716 --> 12:26.985
We have to leave.

12:26.986 --> 12:28.445
Why?

12:30.459 --> 12:33.164
'Cause there's asbestos in the walls.

12:33.165 --> 12:35.502
And the city found out and
they want to shut us down.

12:35.503 --> 12:37.706
That fucking Mayor Daley.

12:37.707 --> 12:40.846
First he hands the White House
to that goddamn Catholic,

12:40.847 --> 12:43.418
and now this crap.

12:43.419 --> 12:46.257
We gotta get you out of your apartment.

12:46.258 --> 12:48.728
Just for a few days. You
can come home with me.

12:48.729 --> 12:52.135
(GASPS) I can stay with you, Sandy?

12:52.136 --> 12:54.340
Yep. I got a room all ready for you.

12:54.341 --> 12:56.377
- Oh! I'll go pack.
- Okay.

12:56.378 --> 12:58.548
Oh! Oh, we'll have fun.

12:58.549 --> 12:59.984
We can go out on the town

12:59.985 --> 13:03.024
and let the boys feel us
up on the dance floor.

13:03.025 --> 13:05.562
(CHUCKLES)

13:05.563 --> 13:06.998
Oh.

13:06.999 --> 13:10.004
Motel orgy loot.

13:10.005 --> 13:11.540
Frank, give Debbie a wallet.

13:11.541 --> 13:13.846
Or better yet, give her a ring.

13:13.847 --> 13:15.014
For their wedding.

13:15.015 --> 13:16.317
I'm buying her ring.

13:16.318 --> 13:18.989
Aww, that is so romantic.

13:18.990 --> 13:20.558
I lost mine years ago.

13:20.559 --> 13:22.162
You sold it for crack.

13:22.163 --> 13:23.832
Let's see how this one
looks on you, my love.

13:23.833 --> 13:25.602
I think it's a real diamond.

13:25.603 --> 13:28.708
Wow. I wonder how much Raoul's
gonna give us for it.

13:28.709 --> 13:30.111
We can't sell this.

13:30.112 --> 13:31.547
Why not? It's the best of the bunch.

13:31.548 --> 13:34.186
No. It fits like a glass slipper.

13:34.187 --> 13:37.193
That should never leave your finger.

13:43.705 --> 13:46.585
- Monica Jean Darrgen...
- Yeah?

13:48.148 --> 13:50.018
Will you marry me?

13:50.019 --> 13:51.855
But what about getting
money for the kids?

13:51.856 --> 13:54.560
Let's give the kids something
more valuable than money.

13:54.561 --> 13:56.564
An example of real love.

13:56.565 --> 13:58.501
And then we'll go back to work tomorrow?

13:58.502 --> 14:02.108
Sure. Today we proclaim how we feel

14:02.109 --> 14:04.379
before God and the whole world.

14:04.380 --> 14:06.116
Pretty sure the whole
world doesn't care.

14:06.117 --> 14:07.752
Pretty sure God doesn't either.

14:07.753 --> 14:10.159
Will you make me the
happiest man in the world?

14:11.361 --> 14:13.698
- Um...
- Come on.

14:13.699 --> 14:16.370
- Yes.
- (BOTH LAUGHING)

14:16.371 --> 14:20.256
Yes, yes, yes.

14:23.051 --> 14:25.588
We need new wheels in case
anyone made us back there.

14:25.589 --> 14:28.060
Huh, sounds about right.

14:28.061 --> 14:29.797
All right, green one.

14:29.798 --> 14:32.669
Oh, hell no. Look at this Camaro.

14:32.670 --> 14:34.807
Dumb ass, the window on
the green one is down.

14:34.808 --> 14:36.076
There's no alarm.

14:36.077 --> 14:37.552
But it's so beautiful.

14:39.350 --> 14:41.788
Da... Damon, you're on lookout.

14:41.789 --> 14:42.973
Come on.

14:45.596 --> 14:48.535
(GRUNTING)

14:51.909 --> 14:53.444
Come on, hurry up.

14:53.445 --> 14:56.250
I'm a little out of practice.

14:56.251 --> 14:58.554
No, you got it. It's the other...

14:58.555 --> 14:59.924
Do I tell you how to do EMT shit?

14:59.925 --> 15:01.060
- I just...
- Leave the goddamn stealing

15:01.061 --> 15:03.342
- to the experts. Fuck.
- Okay.

15:05.469 --> 15:09.176
(CAR ENGINE STARTS)

15:09.177 --> 15:10.858
Let's go.

15:12.650 --> 15:14.954
Hope Damon knows how to hitchhike.

15:14.955 --> 15:16.490
We're ditching him?

15:16.491 --> 15:18.094
Mouth-breather's gonna get
us arrested or killed.

15:18.095 --> 15:19.831
- Better it's just us.
- Oh, sh...

15:19.832 --> 15:21.753
Adios, motherfucker.

15:23.338 --> 15:25.274
Mickey! What the fuck?

15:25.275 --> 15:27.279
Bitch, go my own way.

15:29.017 --> 15:31.220
I thought to myself, "What
are you doing, Robin?

15:31.221 --> 15:33.557
"You have a 4.0 GPA.

15:33.558 --> 15:36.321
You were, like, president
of your high school class."

15:37.333 --> 15:41.240
I called my mom and dad even
though it was 2:00 a. m.

15:41.241 --> 15:44.747
They were like, "We love you."

15:46.886 --> 15:49.156
I haven't had a drink in seven months.

15:49.157 --> 15:52.163
(APPLAUSE)

15:54.000 --> 15:57.006
I was just elected rush
chair of my sorority and...

16:00.512 --> 16:02.516
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

16:08.662 --> 16:10.565
Hey, you got a square?

16:10.566 --> 16:12.605
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

16:13.638 --> 16:15.174
Appreciate it.

16:15.175 --> 16:16.845
She still at it?

16:16.846 --> 16:19.015
Yeah.

16:19.016 --> 16:21.253
I swear, if I have to listen
to that same bullshit story

16:21.254 --> 16:24.259
one more time, I can't be held
responsible for my actions.

16:24.260 --> 16:25.428
Yeah, listening to that
shit makes me want

16:25.429 --> 16:28.334
to drink more, not less.

16:28.335 --> 16:30.104
You're new, right?

16:30.105 --> 16:32.242
Yeah, it's my second meeting.

16:32.243 --> 16:33.912
We should grab some coffee.

16:33.913 --> 16:36.517
Swap some real drinking stories.

16:36.518 --> 16:37.787
Look, you're hitting on me

16:37.788 --> 16:39.589
or trying to get me to
buy into this crap.

16:39.590 --> 16:41.593
Either way, I'm not fucking into it.

16:41.594 --> 16:43.133
You don't think I'm attractive?

16:44.734 --> 16:48.474
Look, uh, I'm not doing
any steps, all right?

16:48.475 --> 16:51.915
Not making any fucking amends.

16:51.916 --> 16:54.019
You think I'm being altruistic?

16:54.020 --> 16:55.856
I'm doing it for me, man.

16:55.857 --> 16:58.863
I still need this shit to stay sober.

17:01.501 --> 17:02.735
I got work.

17:02.736 --> 17:04.941
Come on. We can meet up after.

17:04.942 --> 17:07.111
Just two drunks swapping war stories.

17:07.112 --> 17:10.117
Whatever crazy shit you
did, I bet I can top it.

17:25.983 --> 17:27.551
Hi, is the job still open?

17:27.553 --> 17:30.424
Hi. Yeah.

17:30.425 --> 17:32.295
Here's an application.

17:32.296 --> 17:33.999
Spanish okay?

17:34.000 --> 17:37.138
I was gonna have a tough
enough time in English.

17:37.139 --> 17:40.144
Let's see. You know what?

17:40.145 --> 17:41.915
I can't find any in English.

17:41.916 --> 17:43.952
I haven't been asked for
one of those in a while.

17:43.953 --> 17:45.321
Why don't I translate?

17:45.322 --> 17:46.590
I'll write in your answers for you.

17:46.591 --> 17:48.093
Sounds good.

17:48.094 --> 17:49.596
Your writing's probably
nicer than mine anyways.

17:49.597 --> 17:50.893
Okay, name.

17:51.634 --> 17:54.272
How do you say "ball" in Spanish?

17:54.814 --> 17:55.946
<i>Pelota.</i>

17:55.947 --> 17:58.223
I'm Kevin Pelota.

18:01.060 --> 18:03.257
Kevin Pelota.

18:03.258 --> 18:06.096
How long have you been
operating a CNC machine?

18:06.097 --> 18:08.056
Was that English?

18:08.768 --> 18:11.319
Do you know how to
program a CNC machine?

18:12.409 --> 18:13.912
Piece of cake.

18:13.913 --> 18:15.181
Are you lying?

18:15.182 --> 18:17.920
No.

18:17.921 --> 18:19.489
I want a man's job,

18:19.490 --> 18:21.493
where you pull up your sleeves
and get your hands dirty.

18:21.494 --> 18:23.130
Get in your time machine.

18:23.131 --> 18:24.967
Those jobs don't exist anymore.

18:24.968 --> 18:26.636
Everything's computerized now.

18:26.637 --> 18:28.140
Oh, computers.

18:28.141 --> 18:30.444
What is so special about
computers anyway?

18:30.445 --> 18:33.117
I mean, sure, they seem awesome.
They help you rip off movies.

18:33.118 --> 18:36.356
But what happens when they
become self-aware, huh? Huh?

18:36.357 --> 18:39.363
(MACHINES HUMMING)

18:46.477 --> 18:49.416
(DANCE MUSIC)

18:52.189 --> 18:54.492
So how's this guy gonna
sneak us in to Mexico?

18:54.493 --> 18:57.465
Fuck if I know. Piñata?

18:57.466 --> 19:00.472
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

19:04.948 --> 19:07.151
These are pretty good beans, man.

19:07.152 --> 19:10.158
Guess they don't call 'em
beaners for nothing, huh?

19:15.202 --> 19:18.006
Which one of them's your guy?

19:18.007 --> 19:19.409
You sure we should be barging in...

19:19.410 --> 19:21.647
Hey, which one of you guys is Jesús?

19:24.888 --> 19:27.391
I'm Jesus.

19:27.392 --> 19:29.329
Oh. Never thought I'd say this,

19:29.330 --> 19:31.390
but I'm glad I finally found Jesus.

19:35.542 --> 19:38.213
- Hey.
- Dishes are piling up.

19:38.214 --> 19:39.950
What? Shit, Lip again?

19:39.951 --> 19:41.219
(EXHALES SHARPLY) Not his fault.

19:41.220 --> 19:42.588
Your parents are in the kitchen.

19:42.589 --> 19:44.359
What?

19:44.360 --> 19:45.628
- Hey.
- I'm trying to talk to you.

19:45.629 --> 19:48.033
- Lip, come on.
- Get out of my kitchen.

19:48.034 --> 19:51.573
- Yeah, my sentiments exactly.
- There's my firstborn.

19:51.574 --> 19:52.809
We want you to be our maid of honor.

19:52.810 --> 19:54.379
What? What are you talking about?

19:54.380 --> 19:57.953
- Oh, you're gonna love this.
- Show her.

19:57.954 --> 19:59.255
You stole a ring. So what?

19:59.256 --> 20:01.092
How we acquired it is beside the point.

20:01.093 --> 20:03.497
- We're getting married.
- You're already married.

20:03.498 --> 20:05.401
- Only legally.
- Yeah.

20:05.402 --> 20:07.672
We're... we're recommitting
our hearts to each other.

20:07.673 --> 20:09.008
Yeah, you need to find them first.

20:09.009 --> 20:10.779
Hey, this is important.

20:10.780 --> 20:12.281
Honor your father and mother.

20:12.282 --> 20:13.617
He's working.

20:13.618 --> 20:15.688
We're renewing our vows this afternoon.

20:15.689 --> 20:17.024
Which vows? The ones
where you put yourselves

20:17.025 --> 20:18.861
before everyone first?

20:18.862 --> 20:20.999
Or the ones where you don't take
responsibility for your actions?

20:21.000 --> 20:22.803
Hey, all I had to do was pull out

20:22.804 --> 20:24.372
and you never would have been born.

20:24.373 --> 20:26.109
You were too high to pull out.

20:26.110 --> 20:28.313
Debbie's coming. And Liam.

20:28.314 --> 20:30.684
And I texted Ian, but
I haven't heard back.

20:30.685 --> 20:33.023
- Oh, we gotta call Carl.
- Yes, Carl!

20:33.024 --> 20:34.692
Carl's in military school.

20:34.693 --> 20:35.694
You ever hear of a plane?

20:35.695 --> 20:37.231
Out of curiosity,

20:37.232 --> 20:39.035
who's officiating this
bullshit ceremony?

20:39.036 --> 20:41.841
We don't need middlemen.
This is between God and us.

20:41.842 --> 20:43.176
Well, that's a good thing

20:43.177 --> 20:44.646
because no priest will come near you

20:44.647 --> 20:46.082
after what happened at
your first wedding.

20:46.083 --> 20:47.752
Oh, yeah, didn't you
puke on Father McDougal?

20:47.753 --> 20:49.389
- Mm-hmm.
- You weren't even there.

20:49.390 --> 20:50.624
I was there for the second one.

20:50.625 --> 20:52.796
Oh, Christ. The naked wedding.

20:52.797 --> 20:54.165
That was beautiful.

20:54.166 --> 20:55.601
If you're a pedophile.

20:55.602 --> 20:58.140
Why do you two keep harping on the past?

20:58.141 --> 21:01.646
This is why your lives are so messed up.

21:01.647 --> 21:04.787
Oh, yeah, that's the reason.

21:04.788 --> 21:07.525
You deserved a better mother.

21:07.526 --> 21:10.531
You needed me. I wasn't there.

21:10.532 --> 21:12.568
I'm asking for a fresh start.

21:12.569 --> 21:15.575
A new beginning. For the family.

21:17.312 --> 21:19.316
Please come.

21:33.946 --> 21:35.214
You're not gonna go, are you?

21:35.215 --> 21:37.219
Fuck, no.

21:38.789 --> 21:40.462
Carlos gave me your name.

21:43.398 --> 21:45.567
Which Carlos? I know 30 of them.

21:45.568 --> 21:46.804
Cook County Correctional.

21:46.805 --> 21:48.273
So that narrows it down to four.

21:48.274 --> 21:50.677
- We need a coyote.
- For what?

21:50.678 --> 21:53.383
To sneak us across the border.

21:53.384 --> 21:54.920
You're already across the border.

21:54.921 --> 21:56.800
No, the, uh, other side.

21:57.994 --> 21:59.562
You want me to sneak you into Mexico?

21:59.563 --> 22:03.996

22:29.958 --> 22:31.927

am I supposed to do?

22:34.600 --> 22:37.638
It's not my problem, homie.
You're on your fucking own.

Oh, don't worry about
it. I'll get a job.

22:59.316 --> 23:00.952
I'll work for my mom at the salon.

23:00.953 --> 23:04.091
- But what about my balls?
- What about feeding our girls?

23:04.092 --> 23:05.594
You said we were okay.

23:05.595 --> 23:06.897
For a little while.

23:06.898 --> 23:08.767
I'll work at your mom's then.

23:34.486 --> 23:36.490
I brought my cats.

23:45.208 --> 23:47.812
You can bring two of them.

Ugh, Etta's.

Yeah, I'll do it.

24:03.812 --> 24:05.514
You believe Frank and Monica?

24:05.515 --> 24:09.121
Never a dull moment when
the shitshow's in town.

24:09.122 --> 24:10.357
- You got that?
- Yeah.

24:10.358 --> 24:12.361
Yeah.

24:12.362 --> 24:14.833
I'd carry this stuff home for
you, but my shift's not over.

So, let's hear if your drinking stories

27:46.723 --> 27:48.726
are as good as a Tri Delt's.

27:48.727 --> 27:51.833
I don't know. I had a
bad breakup last year.

27:51.834 --> 27:55.707
Uh, took a crowbar to a professor's car.

27:55.708 --> 27:58.045
And took on a couple of campus cops.

27:58.046 --> 28:00.049
- How'd that go?
- Not well.

28:00.050 --> 28:03.857
(CHUCKLES) Is that the best you got?

28:03.858 --> 28:05.160
I pissed on a sorority mom.

28:05.161 --> 28:06.830
Hey. Was she into it?

28:06.831 --> 28:10.103
- No, definitely not.
- Oh. Darn.

28:10.104 --> 28:12.040

28:12.041 --> 28:13.576
Only once? (CHUCKLES)

28:13.577 --> 28:17.350
Yeah, the third time I did
that, I ruptured my spleen.

28:17.351 --> 28:19.254
Almost died.

28:19.255 --> 28:21.525
Don't know how it happened to this day.

28:21.526 --> 28:23.296
So that was your rock bottom?

28:23.297 --> 28:25.033
Oh, fuck no. No, no.

28:25.034 --> 28:28.573
No, it was a combo of, uh,
booze and angel dust.

28:28.574 --> 28:30.109
Got all paranoid.

28:30.110 --> 28:31.813
I thought my girlfriend
called the cops on me.

28:31.814 --> 28:33.716
Locked her in our apartment,
put a gun to her head,

28:33.717 --> 28:35.720
pulled the trigger.

28:35.721 --> 28:37.290
I mean, the chamber
was empty, thank God.

28:37.291 --> 28:40.263
I didn't know that, but, uh, yeah.

28:40.264 --> 28:42.935
I woulda... I woulda fucking killed her.

28:42.936 --> 28:45.673
Yeah, you win.

28:45.674 --> 28:47.244
So when did you have your first drink?

28:47.245 --> 28:50.083
- Fourth grade.
- First time you puked?

28:50.084 --> 28:52.220
Fourth grade.

28:52.221 --> 28:55.593
Uh, my parents, they,
um, they encouraged it.

28:55.594 --> 28:58.099
(LAUGHING) Is that a joke?

28:58.100 --> 29:00.703
No. I mean, everyone I knew drank.

29:00.704 --> 29:02.707
You know, it was, uh, in our house,

29:02.708 --> 29:05.046
friends' houses, school, everywhere.

29:05.047 --> 29:08.386
You know, it's just what
the neighborhood's like.

29:08.387 --> 29:12.427
Well, there's a reason
people like it, you know.

29:12.428 --> 29:14.799
Feels good.

29:14.800 --> 29:17.348
Feels good waking up in a hospital?

29:18.754 --> 29:20.004
No.

29:21.012 --> 29:22.681
Drinking, it, uh,

29:22.682 --> 29:24.800
you know, it turns the volume down.

29:26.256 --> 29:28.653
You know, makes the
world more tolerable.

29:30.264 --> 29:33.002
Sounds like drinking might
not be your only problem.

29:33.003 --> 29:34.271
Holy shit, you're right.

29:34.272 --> 29:35.273
You know, I never thought of that.

29:36.676 --> 29:38.814
- Okay.
- Hey, all right.

uh, I should go network.

30:38.968 --> 30:41.238

30:41.239 --> 30:43.242
You know, Chad bought a couple
of single-family houses

30:43.243 --> 30:45.848
over on Wallace. Now he
thinks he's Herb Allen.

30:45.849 --> 30:48.152
(CHUCKLES) I didn't know that
Chad invested on his own.

30:48.153 --> 30:49.454
Yeah, when he doesn't have his lips

30:49.455 --> 30:51.191

30:51.192 --> 30:52.260
(CHUCKLES)

30:52.261 --> 30:53.729
Yeah, I used to have Chad's job.

30:53.730 --> 30:56.468
That was four years of
taking Margo's shit.

30:56.469 --> 30:58.381
It was a better education than Wharton.

30:59.977 --> 31:02.413
Am I supposed to know what Wharton is?

31:02.414 --> 31:05.620
Okay, all right. Where
did you go to school?

31:05.621 --> 31:07.958
- Nowhere you've ever heard of.
- Try me.

31:07.959 --> 31:10.663
Ridgedale High.

31:10.664 --> 31:12.300
I went to Tilden.

You're South Side?

31:13.436 --> 31:14.571
Yeah, born and bred.

31:14.572 --> 31:16.575
My dad used to work construction.

31:16.576 --> 31:17.778
He let me tag along in the summers.

31:17.779 --> 31:19.180
I got the building bug.

31:19.181 --> 31:20.616

name of my company,

Oh, I-I don't have a company.
It was a one time thing.

31:29.035 --> 31:32.140
So did you get inside
information on this place?

31:32.141 --> 31:34.946
Like rezoning or something you
knew would jack up the value?

31:34.947 --> 31:36.951
Just right place, right time, you know?

31:42.661 --> 31:44.164
What's taking her so long?

31:44.165 --> 31:45.867
Maybe you didn't notice,
but Fiona and Monica

31:45.868 --> 31:48.874
aren't exactly the same
size. I had to improvise.

31:56.689 --> 31:59.661
You look as beautiful as the
first time you wore that.

31:59.662 --> 32:01.666
Oh, Frank.

32:06.977 --> 32:09.782
Thanks.

32:09.783 --> 32:11.787
I wrote my vows down.

32:14.392 --> 32:18.499
My handsome Frank.

32:18.500 --> 32:22.508
You're my best friend and
the best fuck I ever had.

32:25.380 --> 32:29.154
Today I commit to a new
beginning together.

32:29.155 --> 32:31.993
To leaving the past in the past.

32:31.994 --> 32:35.433
I forgive you for
everything you've done.

32:35.434 --> 32:37.905
For stealing my dad's car

32:37.906 --> 32:40.342
and driving it into Lake Michigan.

32:40.343 --> 32:42.781
For not telling me when you
cut that batch of coke

32:42.782 --> 32:45.119
with just a touch of Drano.

32:45.120 --> 32:48.225
I forgive you for promising
me to that drug dealer

32:48.226 --> 32:50.529

three blocks with the car.

32:56.209 --> 32:58.011
No, it wasn't, my love.

32:58.012 --> 32:59.380

32:59.381 --> 33:00.750

33:05.227 --> 33:06.661
No, you were getting back at me

33:06.662 --> 33:08.665
for throwing you in front of the El.

33:08.666 --> 33:11.238
If I hadn't climbed off the
tracks, you would've killed me.

the cauliflower ears!

33:46.977 --> 33:49.090
What? No nuggets of wisdom?

33:50.584 --> 33:52.453
Have you tried knitting?

33:52.454 --> 33:54.057
What, knitting?

33:54.058 --> 33:56.228
Yeah. Helped me to have a distraction.

33:56.229 --> 33:58.031
You know, when you stop drinking,

33:58.032 --> 34:00.436
all of a sudden you got all
this free time on your hands.

cutting the shit out of myself.

Oh, so that's your key to staying
sober? Fucking knitting?

(CHUCKLES) Well, I ain't fucking Yoda.

34:08.585 --> 34:12.726
I mean, the only key to staying
sober is not drinking.

34:12.728 --> 34:15.431
Knitting and sugar helped me stay sane.

That and meetings, so
for what it's worth,

34:16.904 --> 34:18.973

ain't your fucking babysitter.

You really want to stop drinking?

34:28.493 --> 34:30.034
I mean, do you really want to?

34:31.800 --> 34:33.400
Yes.

34:35.005 --> 34:37.476

at the next meeting.

- You could just rip it out.

back on the market.

a loan for that much.

- Good.
- But the building's not worth

(CHUCKLES) Apartment building.

45:25.172 --> 45:26.774
I was joking.

45:26.775 --> 45:29.145
I'm doing my due diligence.

45:29.146 --> 45:31.676
Making sure it's a smart investment.

45:34.966 --> 45:37.338
And waiting for you
to tear me a new one.

45:38.664 --> 45:41.531
It's no crazier than you
buying the laundromat.

45:42.172 --> 45:44.447
You know, and you pulled that off.

45:45.351 --> 45:47.382
I really didn't think you could.

45:47.650 --> 45:49.631
But you did.

45:51.763 --> 45:53.969
Was that supposed to be a compliment?

45:55.465 --> 45:57.469
I was wrong.

45:59.607 --> 46:01.611
About the laundromat.

46:04.250 --> 46:05.611
About you.

46:06.287 --> 46:09.994
(LAUGHS) Never thought I'd
hear you say those words.

46:09.995 --> 46:12.216
Are you feeling okay?

46:13.278 --> 46:15.261
Honestly, I feel a little bit weird.

46:15.840 --> 46:17.675
Uh, me too.

46:17.676 --> 46:19.680
Now I feel kinda like I'm rolling.

46:24.858 --> 46:27.729
- Fuck.
- You spike our fucking drinks?

46:27.730 --> 46:29.466
Yeah. With Molly. It's a party.

46:29.467 --> 46:30.802
This is how you help me stay sober?

46:30.803 --> 46:32.305
She was acting in your best interest.

46:32.306 --> 46:34.209
I don't know why I'm even surprised.

46:34.210 --> 46:35.644
I'm surprised. I mean, since when

46:35.645 --> 46:37.548
have they ever shared their drugs?

46:37.549 --> 46:39.085
(LAUGHTER)

46:39.086 --> 46:40.856
- Come on, Lip, dance with me.
- No.

46:40.857 --> 46:42.158
- Go.
- Come on, dance with me.

46:42.159 --> 46:43.660
- No.
- Come on, yes.

46:43.661 --> 46:44.562
There's nothing we can do about it now.

46:44.563 --> 46:46.066
- There you go.
- Dance!

46:46.067 --> 46:47.769
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

46:47.770 --> 46:49.439

- No, no, no, no, please.

It was hard seeing you...

through that glass.

47:46.922 --> 47:50.282
Better get moving if we want to
get to the border by morning.

Frankie, I have an idea

49:13.094 --> 49:15.330
about how I can leave
something for the kids.

49:15.331 --> 49:17.034
But I've been holding back on it

probably pretty dangerous.
