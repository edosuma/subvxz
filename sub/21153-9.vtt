00:01.335 --> 00:04.471
JAMIE: Ten years ago,
the animal population mutated,

00:04.505 --> 00:07.075
endangering human
life on the planet.

00:07.108 --> 00:09.143
Our team managed to
cure the animals,

00:09.177 --> 00:10.511
but at a terrible cost.

00:12.080 --> 00:14.615
In an attempt to return
the planet to the animals,

00:14.648 --> 00:15.692
a secretive group
called the Shepherds

00:15.716 --> 00:19.053
released a gas that
sterilized all of humanity.

00:20.821 --> 00:23.191
And then lab-made
creatures called hybrids

00:23.224 --> 00:24.325
devastated the West Coast.

00:24.358 --> 00:27.228
So a massive barrier
was constructed

00:27.261 --> 00:29.697
to protect the rest
of North America.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.232
But new breeds have
started to appear,

00:31.265 --> 00:34.535
so we reassembled our team.

00:34.568 --> 00:37.205
We battle on many fronts,

00:37.238 --> 00:39.307
searching for a
cure to sterility,

00:39.340 --> 00:41.709
while racing to stop the hybrids

00:41.742 --> 00:43.577
and the rogue Shepherd
who created them

00:43.611 --> 00:46.247
to end the human race.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.183
The fight for mankind's
survival has just begun.

00:49.217 --> 00:51.152
Previously on Zoo...

00:51.185 --> 00:54.222
NGUYEN: Four hikers died
from massive hemorrhaging,

00:54.255 --> 00:55.665
trace hybrid DNA
found in their lungs.

00:55.689 --> 00:56.833
After we determined
that the hybrid spores

00:56.857 --> 00:58.359
were the cause of death...

00:58.392 --> 01:00.528
We traced the spores to
their point of origin,

01:00.561 --> 01:02.096
The Black Forest, Germany.

01:02.130 --> 01:03.797
We believe that this
is a hybrid nest.

01:03.831 --> 01:06.234
ABIGAIL: When you commanded
that tiger to attack,

01:06.267 --> 01:08.202
you handed me your secret:

01:08.236 --> 01:10.171
the way you control the animals,

01:10.204 --> 01:13.274
the last piece I need
to activate the beacons

01:13.307 --> 01:15.509
and the hybrids' rise.

01:15.543 --> 01:17.245
JAMIE: Mitch!
Stop calling me that.

01:17.278 --> 01:19.313
Mitch,
we need to reboot the plane now.

01:19.347 --> 01:20.281
My name is Duncan.

01:20.314 --> 01:22.250
A.I. LOGAN: Prepare
for emergency landing.

01:22.283 --> 01:24.318
If I don't throw that
switch, we are all gonna die.

01:24.352 --> 01:25.353
That's the idea.

01:29.190 --> 01:30.824
Damn it, Mitch, let me go!

01:30.858 --> 01:32.626
Mitch isn't here anymore.
(grunts)

01:38.866 --> 01:40.368
(Jamie grunting)

01:42.736 --> 01:47.575
A.I. LOGAN: Minimum recovery
altitude in 50 seconds.

01:56.350 --> 02:01.189
Minimum recovery
altitude in 40 seconds.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.729
Minimum recovery
altitude in 30 seconds.

02:09.763 --> 02:11.599
(grunting)

02:19.440 --> 02:22.876
20, 19, 18,

02:22.910 --> 02:24.778
17, 16,

02:24.812 --> 02:28.249
15, 14, 13,

02:28.282 --> 02:30.284
12, 11,

02:30.318 --> 02:32.653
ten, nine, eight...

02:38.359 --> 02:40.328
(grunting)

02:44.832 --> 02:47.335
MAX: Jamie.

02:47.368 --> 02:48.769
(Max panting)

02:48.802 --> 02:50.471
Jamie.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.608
Jamie. Jamie.

02:54.642 --> 02:55.802
Jamie, oh, oh, there you are.

02:56.977 --> 02:58.522
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
slow down, slow down.

02:58.546 --> 03:00.314
Slow down. You got knocked out.

03:00.348 --> 03:01.915
You were out a half an hour.

03:01.949 --> 03:06.487
Mitch, he...

03:06.520 --> 03:07.855
he was...

03:07.888 --> 03:10.758
i-it was like he
was somebody else.

03:10.791 --> 03:12.926
Yeah.

03:12.960 --> 03:16.497
I hurt him. I hurt him.

03:16.530 --> 03:19.433
I... I was trying to
get to the switch.

03:19.467 --> 03:21.469
You got there in time.

03:21.502 --> 03:22.370
You saved us.

03:22.403 --> 03:23.871
You saved all of us.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.473
Mitch, too?

03:25.506 --> 03:29.910
Mitch or Duncan...

03:29.943 --> 03:33.414
or whoever that was,

03:33.447 --> 03:34.715
is not on the plane.

03:34.748 --> 03:37.418
I'm sorry.

03:37.451 --> 03:38.552
Mitch is gone.

03:53.401 --> 03:55.503
The tank kept Clem safe.

03:55.536 --> 03:56.737
Somehow...

03:56.770 --> 03:58.706
the spinal fluid survived.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.508
We can still make the cure.

04:11.051 --> 04:12.386
You're leaving?

04:12.420 --> 04:13.887
We are.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.856
You, me, Isaac.

04:15.889 --> 04:17.491
I packed your bag.

04:19.493 --> 04:20.994
Where is this coming from?

04:22.563 --> 04:24.698
Do you even have to ask?

04:24.732 --> 04:28.068
Look around you.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.438
Look at what we put
our son through.

04:33.541 --> 04:37.845
When those men came
and took our son,

04:37.878 --> 04:41.749
we had to watch them drive
away with Isaac in a cage,

04:41.782 --> 04:43.984
like some animal.

04:44.017 --> 04:46.520
That was the worst
moment of my life...

04:46.554 --> 04:48.856
until today. Dariela.

04:48.889 --> 04:52.560
(crying): Today,
I thought I was gonna watch my son die

04:52.593 --> 04:56.697
because of my decision,
because of something I did.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.599
It isn't safe here.

05:00.601 --> 05:04.104
Isaac,
we cannot make him part of this.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.573
Let's go home.

05:05.606 --> 05:07.641
What about the cure?

05:07.675 --> 05:09.377
We're so close,

05:09.410 --> 05:11.412
and it...
Let them figure it out.

05:11.445 --> 05:14.582
Please, Abe.

05:20.788 --> 05:23.424
I can't.

05:27.495 --> 05:29.697
ISAAC: Dad?

05:35.803 --> 05:37.738
Come here.

05:51.051 --> 05:55.889
You and Mommy are
going to go home first,

05:55.923 --> 05:58.426
then I'm going to
join you when I can.

05:58.459 --> 05:59.627
But... I want you to make me

05:59.660 --> 06:02.496
a promise,
that you'll be a good boy

06:02.530 --> 06:04.565
and look after your mother.

06:08.502 --> 06:10.904
I promise, Daddy.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.508
Good boy.

06:22.516 --> 06:23.817
Be careful, Abe.

06:23.851 --> 06:25.653
(crying): We need you back

06:25.686 --> 06:28.656
once you're done
saving the world.

06:33.927 --> 06:35.663
Come on. (sniffles)

06:37.698 --> 06:40.133
Let's go.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.713
(grunts)

06:59.019 --> 07:00.654
(phone rings)

07:00.688 --> 07:02.055
Hello?

07:02.089 --> 07:04.157
Hello?

07:04.191 --> 07:05.859
It's me.

07:05.893 --> 07:08.862
Duncan,
how did you survive the crash?

07:08.896 --> 07:10.898
There was... there was no crash...
No crash.

07:13.601 --> 07:15.603
I parachuted out-out.

07:18.506 --> 07:19.640
Abigail.

07:20.774 --> 07:23.611
There's something wrong...
Something wrong

07:23.644 --> 07:27.915
with my... my head-head.
Something's...

07:32.653 --> 07:33.921
It's the bio-drive.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.222
Can you reset it?

07:35.255 --> 07:36.957
Reset it remotely-remotely?

07:36.990 --> 07:40.828
No, you need to come home now.

07:54.542 --> 07:56.544
â™ª

08:06.554 --> 08:07.755
I don't know where he's going,

08:07.788 --> 08:10.624
but I got a hit on his cell
phone right before it went dead.

08:14.227 --> 08:18.031
Okay,
then I need Sat-4 covering west

08:18.065 --> 08:20.000
of the Spandauer Forest

08:20.033 --> 08:24.705
and Sat-9 watching everything
south till Brandenburg.

08:24.738 --> 08:26.874
Both running facial recognition.

08:29.276 --> 08:32.212
Well, half that and
I'll double the pay.

08:32.245 --> 08:34.648
That's impressive.

08:40.888 --> 08:42.556
Well, when you spend a decade

08:42.590 --> 08:44.692
chasing after people who
don't want to be found,

08:44.725 --> 08:47.327
you pick up a few things.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.297
Have you heard anything
from Jackson yet?

08:58.338 --> 09:00.808
I'm sure he'll show
up soon enough.

09:00.841 --> 09:03.143
I highly doubt he's
just going to show up.

09:03.176 --> 09:04.645
Then we'll find him.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.279
Mitch, too.

09:06.313 --> 09:07.347
Will we?

09:07.380 --> 09:08.816
All of them.

09:08.849 --> 09:11.318
Clem is floating in a tank.

09:11.351 --> 09:12.185
Jackson's vanished.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.954
Mitch is gone.

09:13.987 --> 09:16.189
Dariela wised up
and got out of here.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.091
We'll get them back.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.963
When Dariela left...

09:22.996 --> 09:25.165
I could've left with her.

09:25.198 --> 09:27.968
In fact, I probably should have.

09:28.001 --> 09:30.170
But you know why I didn't?

09:31.338 --> 09:34.174
Faith.

09:34.207 --> 09:35.876
Faith in our mission.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.912
Faith in our team.

09:38.946 --> 09:43.250
Faith that we are
doing the right thing.

09:43.283 --> 09:45.686
And we are the
only ones who can.

09:45.719 --> 09:50.190
Oh, but, Abe,
I wish I felt that way.

09:50.223 --> 09:52.626
I wish I had your conviction.

09:55.262 --> 09:58.231
But what if faith isn't enough?

10:08.241 --> 10:10.944
I'll let you know if
I hear from Jackson.

10:23.356 --> 10:26.927
Reports just come back
from our team in Germany.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.395
They're doing a final sweep now,

10:28.428 --> 10:30.363
but it looks like
they got them all.

10:30.397 --> 10:32.132
Any trace of the spores?

10:32.165 --> 10:34.401
Negative. The nest is clear.

10:34.434 --> 10:37.871
Listen up, everyone.

10:37.905 --> 10:41.408
That is one down and
three more to go.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.076
(applause)

10:49.449 --> 10:52.052
These hybrid nests
release toxic spores

10:52.085 --> 10:53.296
any time someone gets near them,

10:53.320 --> 10:56.289
and we have no answer for that.

10:56.323 --> 10:59.793
22 soldiers died
eliminating this nest.

10:59.827 --> 11:02.763
No one is calling this a
victory, Detective.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.365
It's just a start.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.838
We have Seoul and Atlanta next.

11:10.871 --> 11:14.007
We still have no idea how
to neutralize the spores.

11:14.041 --> 11:17.878
And no clue how many
more nests are out there.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.980
We need people who can
deal with the unknown

11:20.013 --> 11:21.882
because that's all
that we have right now,

11:21.915 --> 11:23.450
are unknowns.

11:23.483 --> 11:26.386
So have you taken a look at that
personnel jacket that I flagged?

11:26.419 --> 11:28.188
Well, I've been a bit busy here.

11:28.221 --> 11:30.323
Human resources hasn't
exactly been my top priority.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.694
(phone ringing)

11:43.070 --> 11:45.372
(monitor beeps)

11:47.240 --> 11:49.242
Damn it.

11:51.511 --> 11:53.413
They destroyed a hybrid nest.

11:55.482 --> 11:56.784
Doesn't matter.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.451
Come with me.

12:01.154 --> 12:02.956
I managed to
identify Jackson Oz's

12:02.990 --> 12:06.193
animal-controlling frequency.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.495
We're nearly ready to
activate the beacons.

12:11.031 --> 12:12.499
Here.

12:12.532 --> 12:14.001
Sit down.

12:16.469 --> 12:18.171
Whatever they did,
a neural blocker

12:18.205 --> 12:19.506
has been partially compromised.

12:19.539 --> 12:21.308
We'll have to try and reset it.

12:21.341 --> 12:22.742
Hold still.

12:26.814 --> 12:28.748
Easy, easy.

12:43.496 --> 12:45.365
Better?

12:45.398 --> 12:46.867
Yes.

12:46.900 --> 12:49.402
So, tell me what you've learned.

12:51.538 --> 12:54.875
They've been collecting spinal
fluid samples from the hybrids.

12:54.908 --> 12:56.443
They're going after
the stem cells.

12:57.510 --> 12:59.546
To cure sterility.

12:59.579 --> 13:01.048
So, that's surprising.

13:01.081 --> 13:02.883
And pointless.

13:02.916 --> 13:06.286
Without the last hybrid that
genetically links the rest,

13:06.319 --> 13:08.555
it's a dead end. Also,

13:08.588 --> 13:11.224
Mitch's daughter, Clementine...

13:11.258 --> 13:12.492
is pregnant.

13:14.527 --> 13:15.562
Pregnant?

13:15.595 --> 13:17.397
She's only three months in,

13:17.430 --> 13:21.501
but there have
been complications.

13:21.534 --> 13:23.871
She's been in stasis while
they search for the father.

13:25.472 --> 13:28.008
The baby needs a transfusion.

13:28.041 --> 13:30.377
Transfusion.

13:32.045 --> 13:34.047
I can work with that.

13:49.129 --> 13:51.865
Logan.

13:51.899 --> 13:52.966
What are you doing here?

13:53.000 --> 13:54.467
Jamie called in a favor.

13:54.501 --> 13:55.501
Who is this?

13:57.470 --> 13:59.615
This is the Shepherd who's
going to help us find Mitch.

13:59.639 --> 14:02.509
Do you know who I am?

14:02.542 --> 14:04.411
Jamie Campbell.

14:04.444 --> 14:07.580
Got rich selling other
people's stories.

14:07.614 --> 14:10.583
Now you spend your
nights chasing after

14:10.617 --> 14:12.552
those that you exploited.

14:12.585 --> 14:14.421
Sit down.

14:19.692 --> 14:22.529
Jared Macavey, former Shepherd.

14:22.562 --> 14:25.098
You ran security for the
Applied Science Division.

14:25.132 --> 14:27.567
And you've been living in New
England since Pangaea fell.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.502
Alissa Graham.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.138
Peter Runge.

14:31.171 --> 14:32.239
David Hall.

14:32.272 --> 14:33.506
All my friends,

14:33.540 --> 14:36.443
all in federal prison
because of you.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.411
Well,
then it'll be a nice reunion

14:38.445 --> 14:39.612
when you join them there.

14:41.014 --> 14:42.615
Or you can talk to us.

14:42.649 --> 14:44.451
LOGAN: Abigail used
to be one of you

14:44.484 --> 14:46.386
and then she went rogue.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.555
What she's planning
with the hybrids...

14:48.588 --> 14:50.090
it'll undo everything

14:50.123 --> 14:52.559
that you Shepherds
have been working for.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.694
Now, we know that you've
been looking for her.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.664
We know how to find her.

14:58.665 --> 15:01.001
How?

15:01.034 --> 15:03.303
One of the bio-drives
that you created,

15:03.336 --> 15:05.638
Abigail has made a
few modifications.

15:05.672 --> 15:08.575
She's using one to control my
friend, Mitch Morgan.

15:08.608 --> 15:13.146
You've been hunting us
like dogs for a decade.

15:13.180 --> 15:14.681
Your boyfriend goes AWOL,

15:14.714 --> 15:16.483
you come crawling to me,

15:16.516 --> 15:18.651
a Shepherd, praying for help.

15:21.688 --> 15:24.657
I hope he ends up like the
rest of the bio-drive subjects,

15:24.691 --> 15:26.259
choking to death
on his own vomit.

15:26.293 --> 15:27.494
(shouts)

15:27.527 --> 15:29.096
(grunting)

15:31.531 --> 15:33.433
Start talking! LOGAN: Jamie!

15:33.466 --> 15:34.701
Jamie, stop! JARED: No, no.

15:34.734 --> 15:35.668
Stay out of this! That's enough!

15:35.702 --> 15:37.704
Jamie! Hey, what are you doing?

15:37.737 --> 15:38.571
Do you really think
the other Shepherds

15:38.605 --> 15:40.073
are going after Abigail?

15:40.107 --> 15:42.242
Who's left?!
Who's gonna stop her?

15:42.275 --> 15:43.586
(groaning) ABRAHAM: You
know, she's right.

15:43.610 --> 15:46.513
If we're both going
to get what we want,

15:46.546 --> 15:49.049
we're going to have to
start working together.

15:49.082 --> 15:51.418
Okay, okay.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.685
Abigail.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.687
(grunts) (shouts, groans)

15:54.721 --> 15:56.289
I'll get you the
tech stuff you need

15:56.323 --> 15:57.590
to-to find Mitch

15:57.624 --> 16:02.595
and you'll let me walk
free with Abigail.

16:02.629 --> 16:03.629
No strings.

16:05.198 --> 16:07.667
The priority is Mitch.

16:07.700 --> 16:12.372
If Abigail is there,
we get her for a conversation.

16:12.405 --> 16:13.740
And then she's all yours.

16:13.773 --> 16:15.475
Deal.

16:15.508 --> 16:17.777
Deal!

16:17.810 --> 16:20.480
ABRAHAM: Let's go, let's go.

16:20.513 --> 16:21.614
Okay.

16:25.618 --> 16:27.487
Okay.

16:37.697 --> 16:39.032
Abigail.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.711
I didn't expect
to hear from you.

16:51.744 --> 16:53.813
I thought it wasn't safe
for us to meet like this.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.683
It's not, but this is important.

16:56.716 --> 16:59.119
We found Clementine.

17:01.688 --> 17:02.755
What?

17:02.789 --> 17:05.458
And Clementine's pregnant.

17:05.492 --> 17:08.661
It's impossible.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.730
Jackson and his people,
they've taken her.

17:10.762 --> 17:12.299
They've been
experimenting on her,

17:12.332 --> 17:16.169
trying to figure out how the
impossible became possible.

17:16.203 --> 17:17.270
Those people,

17:17.304 --> 17:19.439
everything they've done.

17:19.472 --> 17:20.740
It's okay.

17:20.772 --> 17:22.275
We have Jackson.

17:22.309 --> 17:24.277
We can use him to get her back.

17:24.310 --> 17:25.811
Take me to him.

17:25.845 --> 17:26.713
Now.

17:26.746 --> 17:29.149
Abigail.

17:29.182 --> 17:30.817
Who is this person?

17:30.850 --> 17:35.788
Charles Duncan,
meet Sam Parker...

17:35.822 --> 17:38.758
the father of Clementine's baby.

17:50.703 --> 17:52.705
(grunting)

17:57.744 --> 17:58.711
Come on.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.180
You're Jackson Oz.

18:09.322 --> 18:11.458
And I assume you're another
one of Abigail's goons.

18:11.491 --> 18:13.226
Wrong.

18:13.260 --> 18:14.294
I'm Sam Parker.

18:14.327 --> 18:17.264
Sam Parker?

18:18.298 --> 18:21.334
Sam. Sam,
we've been looking for you.

18:21.368 --> 18:23.403
That's what I've heard.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.771
Look, I don't, I don't know what

18:24.804 --> 18:27.407
Abigail has told you, Sam,
but she's lying to you.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.609
Yeah, she said you'd say that.

18:29.642 --> 18:32.279
Listen to me.

18:32.312 --> 18:34.281
Listen to me very carefully.

18:34.314 --> 18:35.424
Clem is in trouble.
She needs your help.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.317
She said you'd say that, too.

18:37.350 --> 18:38.627
Abigail is not who
you think she is.

18:38.651 --> 18:40.253
Stop.

18:40.287 --> 18:41.554
Just stop it.

18:41.588 --> 18:42.789
This isn't about Abigail.

18:42.822 --> 18:44.291
It's about Clem.

18:44.324 --> 18:45.658
All I care about is Clem.

18:45.692 --> 18:47.836
Well, if you want to help
Clem, then let me out of here.

18:47.860 --> 18:49.262
I know where she is.

18:49.296 --> 18:50.563
All right? I'll take you to her.

18:50.597 --> 18:51.931
She's safe.
She's with my friends.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.366
Why?

18:53.400 --> 18:54.601
So you can bleed me, too?

18:54.634 --> 18:56.636
Run your experiments on me?

18:56.669 --> 18:58.505
Try to find out what
makes me special,

18:58.538 --> 19:00.440
then dump me in a
tank when you're done,

19:00.473 --> 19:01.107
just like you did to her?

19:01.140 --> 19:03.176
No, you got this all wrong.

19:03.210 --> 19:04.511
You destroyed my life once!

19:06.313 --> 19:07.847
I won't let you take
Clem's, too.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.682
Let me out of here, Sam.
Sam, that's enough.

19:09.716 --> 19:12.719
Plenty of time to continue
this conversation.

19:12.752 --> 19:15.522
Let's go. Let's go.

19:25.398 --> 19:26.433
(grunts)

19:26.466 --> 19:28.468
(line ringing)

19:31.538 --> 19:34.774
Hey,
I'm just calling to make sure

19:34.807 --> 19:37.544
you and Isaac arrived safely.

19:39.279 --> 19:42.482
I miss you both.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.284
I love you.

19:44.317 --> 19:45.718
(phone beeps)

19:45.752 --> 19:47.954
Abraham.

19:47.987 --> 19:51.524
What is it, Max?

19:51.558 --> 19:54.627
Leaving messages isn't
really gonna change anything.

19:54.661 --> 19:56.963
It's kind of out
of your control.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.235
What do you suggest?

20:02.269 --> 20:04.471
Well, I've found that when
I make a fool of myself,

20:04.504 --> 20:06.973
which I have by trying to help
Mitch turn off his bio-drive,

20:07.006 --> 20:09.476
nearly getting all of us killed,

20:09.509 --> 20:14.714
it's, uh, best if I retreat to
something I know I'm good at.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.549
And that works?

20:16.583 --> 20:18.918
Well, it got me
through three divorces

20:18.951 --> 20:20.753
and half a dozen
Republican White Houses.

20:20.787 --> 20:23.690
Come here. Check this out.

20:25.692 --> 20:27.294
Yeah.

20:27.327 --> 20:28.595
Check it out.

20:32.765 --> 20:35.302
Hmm?

20:35.335 --> 20:38.571
Is this the enzyme from
the tentacled hybrid?

20:38.605 --> 20:40.340
Yeah. Remarkable, isn't it?

20:40.373 --> 20:44.577
Its anti-pathogenic property
is like nothing I've ever seen.

20:44.611 --> 20:46.579
Sorry,
did you just say anti-pathogen?

20:46.613 --> 20:47.580
Yeah.

20:47.614 --> 20:49.382
ABRAHAM: If Max's research

20:49.416 --> 20:52.519
is to be believed, this enzyme

20:52.552 --> 20:56.956
seems to be able to weaken,
if not destroy, all pathogens:

20:56.989 --> 20:58.625
bacterial, viral, toxigenic...

20:58.658 --> 21:00.960
What about spores?

21:00.993 --> 21:03.463
Spores?

21:03.496 --> 21:07.434
Yeah, I see no reason why it
wouldn't have a similar effect.

21:07.467 --> 21:10.603
Okay, I need everything that
you have on this enzyme ASAP.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.449
(chuckles)

21:22.482 --> 21:24.617
Mitch?

21:31.591 --> 21:32.759
Duncan.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.461
If you're alive,

21:34.494 --> 21:36.094
that means the plane didn't
crash, right?

21:37.430 --> 21:38.565
Mitch, I don't care

21:38.598 --> 21:40.567
what Abigail put in your head,

21:40.600 --> 21:42.435
I know you're still in there.

21:42.469 --> 21:43.703
I know it's you, brother.

21:43.736 --> 21:46.606
Wrong.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.575
The bio-drive.

21:48.608 --> 21:49.885
Disconnects Mitch's
consciousness

21:49.909 --> 21:51.544
and replaces it with this one.

21:52.845 --> 21:54.514
Mine.

21:56.383 --> 21:58.618
Mitch is gone.

21:58.651 --> 22:01.354
I see you two are
getting reacquainted.

22:01.388 --> 22:04.090
I have everything I need.

22:08.895 --> 22:10.497
What?

22:10.530 --> 22:13.032
No raging against the truth?

22:13.065 --> 22:15.668
No trying to free
Mitch from his prison?

22:15.702 --> 22:18.905
I'm disappointed.

22:18.938 --> 22:21.408
My friends are still alive.

22:21.441 --> 22:22.442
This isn't over.

22:22.475 --> 22:23.710
What I'm more concerned about

22:23.743 --> 22:25.712
is what you told Sam...

22:25.745 --> 22:28.014
to make him think
that I'm a villain.

22:28.047 --> 22:30.116
You are the villain
in his story.

22:31.518 --> 22:33.486
We were both on
Pangaea ten years ago

22:33.520 --> 22:35.163
when you and your friends
released the razorbacks

22:35.187 --> 22:36.556
into the Shepherd compound.

22:36.589 --> 22:37.890
Sam was on Pangaea?

22:37.924 --> 22:40.393
Sam lost both his
parents that day.

22:40.427 --> 22:41.461
Thanks to you.

22:44.764 --> 22:50.169
The Shepherds left us
in Section K to die.

22:50.202 --> 22:52.004
With the hybrids,
their mistakes.

22:52.038 --> 22:53.682
I did not... They weren't mistakes.
Our father created the hybrids.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.575
And he knew that he was wrong!

22:55.608 --> 22:57.610
Why else would he
have locked them away

22:57.644 --> 23:01.047
in a forgotten
corner of Pangaea?

23:01.080 --> 23:04.617
He separated them because
he wanted them to thrive.

23:04.651 --> 23:06.152
That was his legacy.

23:06.185 --> 23:07.620
And I carried it on.

23:07.654 --> 23:09.489
I perfected them.

23:09.522 --> 23:11.658
This is not Robert Oz's
legacy, Abigail.

23:11.691 --> 23:13.660
He wouldn't have
wanted any of this.

23:13.693 --> 23:17.530
A world where animals are-are-
are threatened by monsters.

23:17.564 --> 23:18.831
They're not monsters.

23:18.865 --> 23:20.467
He didn't want the hybrids.

23:20.500 --> 23:21.701
He abandoned them.

23:23.570 --> 23:25.838
Because he couldn't
control them.

23:31.978 --> 23:34.647
But you can.

23:34.681 --> 23:35.982
Why?

23:38.050 --> 23:41.688
You have a connection to
them that he never did.

23:41.721 --> 23:43.956
You can speak to them.

23:43.990 --> 23:45.758
Like I can speak to the animals.

23:48.761 --> 23:51.898
The common DNA they all share...

23:51.931 --> 23:54.734
You share it, too.

23:56.769 --> 24:02.008
And now you know our
father's greatest secret.

24:02.041 --> 24:04.711
The one he shared with no one.

24:06.979 --> 24:09.649
Not even me.

24:09.682 --> 24:11.117
You're the last
piece that we need

24:11.150 --> 24:13.019
to cure sterility.

24:17.023 --> 24:18.825
You're a hybrid.

24:30.537 --> 24:32.204
I said that I need
this block cleared.

24:32.238 --> 24:34.841
All nonessential
personnel out of here now.

24:34.874 --> 24:37.844
(phone ringing)

24:37.877 --> 24:39.746
Please tell me some good news.

24:39.779 --> 24:42.114
It's like Christmas over here.

24:42.148 --> 24:43.049
The enzyme worked?

24:43.082 --> 24:47.119
99% effectiveness
against the nest spores.

24:47.153 --> 24:49.255
We'll be sending a
chemical package your way.

24:49.288 --> 24:52.559
Should be more than enough,
given the size and density

24:52.592 --> 24:55.261
of the nests that
we have seen so far.

24:55.294 --> 24:56.796
Hey, guys.

24:56.829 --> 24:58.230
Just go ahead and put that here.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.302
Grinch is sending us a present.

25:03.335 --> 25:07.707
Grinch? Since when did my
team start calling me Grinch?

25:07.740 --> 25:09.175
Merry Christmas.

25:09.208 --> 25:10.643
Hey, did you get a chance

25:10.677 --> 25:12.645
to review that personnel
jacket that I pulled?

25:12.679 --> 25:13.946
You take care of Seoul.

25:13.980 --> 25:15.314
I'll handle this.

25:15.347 --> 25:16.583
Copy that.

25:17.349 --> 25:19.051
(trilling)

25:23.856 --> 25:24.857
(beeping)

25:34.066 --> 25:36.836
(sizzling)

25:43.175 --> 25:45.244
MAX: Okay.

25:45.277 --> 25:47.614
That ought to do it.

25:48.314 --> 25:49.315
Is it going to work?

25:49.348 --> 25:50.116
It'll work.

25:50.149 --> 25:52.985
This thing was
specifically designed

25:53.019 --> 25:54.220
for tracking and maintenance

25:54.253 --> 25:55.955
of the original
bio-drive test subjects.

25:57.223 --> 25:58.591
Shall I do the honors?

26:00.727 --> 26:01.728
(beeps)

26:05.031 --> 26:08.200
(beeping continues)

26:12.204 --> 26:14.340
MAX: Ah!

26:16.208 --> 26:17.677
Copenhagen.

26:17.710 --> 26:19.812
We'll be wheels up in five.

26:25.184 --> 26:26.218
What is all this?

26:28.420 --> 26:32.859
This is what Jackson and
his team have been planning.

26:32.892 --> 26:35.394
They've set up hybrid
nests around the world

26:35.427 --> 26:38.665
that they're going to activate
with a series of beacons.

26:38.698 --> 26:41.233
They're trying to spread the
hybrids across the globe.

26:42.201 --> 26:44.336
SAM: The hybrids from Section K?

26:44.370 --> 26:46.806
That would mean the
end of civilization.

26:46.839 --> 26:48.207
The solution is ready.

26:53.379 --> 26:55.982
Sit down, Sam.

27:00.887 --> 27:04.924
Duncan infiltrated
Jackson and his team.

27:04.957 --> 27:07.760
He came back with intel that
can help us save both Clem

27:07.794 --> 27:08.961
and your baby.

27:08.995 --> 27:10.296
What's wrong with them?

27:10.329 --> 27:11.864
They believe she and the baby

27:11.898 --> 27:14.066
have a blood incompatibility...

27:15.467 --> 27:17.269
that is threatening
the life of your son.

27:17.303 --> 27:19.038
ABIGAIL: He has a
rare blood disorder.

27:19.071 --> 27:21.407
And they don't
know how to fix it.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.275
But we do.

27:23.309 --> 27:24.949
They've been looking
for the baby's father

27:24.977 --> 27:28.414
to perform a blood transfusion.

27:28.447 --> 27:32.318
Our plan is to introduce
this into your bloodstream.

27:32.351 --> 27:33.953
So when they do the transfusion,

27:33.986 --> 27:36.388
it will correct the
blood incompatibility.

27:36.422 --> 27:39.025
And save the first
baby born in a decade.

27:40.326 --> 27:42.328
I don't need to hear any more.

27:42.361 --> 27:44.363
If that stuff is gonna
save Clem and my son,

27:44.396 --> 27:45.364
just do it.

27:45.397 --> 27:47.867
(monitor beeping)

27:52.038 --> 27:54.974
It's the tracker I
left on their plane.

27:55.007 --> 27:56.242
They're headed our way.

27:56.275 --> 27:57.810
How did they find us?

27:59.311 --> 28:00.747
It doesn't matter.

28:00.780 --> 28:01.848
We'll be ready for them.

28:01.881 --> 28:03.883
Let's do this.

28:13.259 --> 28:14.393
(door closes)

28:17.396 --> 28:18.731
(muffled grunting)

28:24.470 --> 28:26.172
(grunts)

28:26.205 --> 28:27.774
Who are you?

28:27.807 --> 28:29.108
Who are you?! Who are you?

28:29.141 --> 28:31.410
My name is Sam Parker.

28:31.443 --> 28:33.479
Please, you have to
help get me out of here.

28:34.781 --> 28:36.015
Sam Parker?

28:36.048 --> 28:38.050
Clem Lewis' Sam Parker?

28:38.084 --> 28:39.518
Clem?

28:39.551 --> 28:41.287
You know Clementine?
Is she here?

28:41.320 --> 28:43.122
Is there anyone else
in the facility?

28:43.155 --> 28:45.391
Uh, just the, uh,
the crazy lady who grabbed me.

28:45.424 --> 28:46.544
I think her name is Abigail.

28:48.828 --> 28:50.196
Was anyone with her?

28:50.229 --> 28:51.430
Some other guy.

28:54.466 --> 28:56.235
I need to take him to the plane.

28:57.269 --> 28:58.504
Clementine is with us.

28:58.537 --> 28:59.806
She needs your help.

29:02.108 --> 29:03.075
What's wrong?

29:03.109 --> 29:04.811
I'll explain on the way.

29:04.844 --> 29:06.054
Are you sure you're
going to be okay with...

29:06.078 --> 29:07.146
Yeah, we'll be fine.

29:07.179 --> 29:08.781
Let's go.

29:17.990 --> 29:20.927
(grunting)

29:36.876 --> 29:37.877
(groans)

29:39.211 --> 29:41.380
(gasping)

29:48.220 --> 29:49.455
(groans)

30:04.536 --> 30:06.105
Jackson. (Jackson yells)

30:08.540 --> 30:09.808
(choking)

30:25.224 --> 30:26.558
(Abigail gasping, coughing)

30:34.533 --> 30:35.868
(gasping) (tablet beeps)

30:39.671 --> 30:41.240
It's Sam.

30:41.273 --> 30:43.009
They took the bait.

30:45.044 --> 30:46.545
What shall I do with him?

30:46.578 --> 30:48.480
We still need him.

30:48.514 --> 30:50.316
And we need to
activate the beacons.

30:50.349 --> 30:51.450
I'll go.

30:51.483 --> 30:53.285
You stall them.

31:03.129 --> 31:04.406
Watch where you're pointing
that thing, please.

31:04.430 --> 31:07.366
Sorry. Hey, focus.

31:14.173 --> 31:15.541
Jackson.

31:20.012 --> 31:21.413
Jackson.

31:21.447 --> 31:24.116
Hey.

31:25.484 --> 31:26.518
Jamie? Yeah.

31:26.552 --> 31:28.387
What happened?

31:28.420 --> 31:29.421
The beacons.

31:29.455 --> 31:31.490
Abigail's gonna activate them.

31:31.523 --> 31:33.092
Have you seen Mitch?

31:33.125 --> 31:34.526
Yeah.

31:34.560 --> 31:37.496
Yeah, I've seen him,
but it's not Mitch.

31:37.529 --> 31:38.530
Yeah, we know.

31:40.499 --> 31:41.500
Macavey.

31:43.035 --> 31:44.270
Where's Macavey?

31:44.303 --> 31:45.571
Who's Macavey?

31:45.604 --> 31:46.604
We have to go.

31:50.042 --> 31:51.510
(panting)

31:51.543 --> 31:53.479
Oh, my God.

31:53.512 --> 31:54.513
Clem?

31:58.417 --> 32:00.052
I didn't know.

32:03.322 --> 32:04.490
I'm so sorry.

32:04.523 --> 32:05.591
This isn't your fault.

32:05.624 --> 32:07.059
Take a seat.

32:07.093 --> 32:10.462
Why didn't she say
anything to me?

32:10.496 --> 32:12.698
When she first found out,

32:12.731 --> 32:14.400
I'm sure she was terrified.

32:14.433 --> 32:15.701
If I had known,

32:15.734 --> 32:18.270
maybe I could have helped.

32:18.304 --> 32:20.639
Why she disappeared...

32:22.608 --> 32:25.677
I thought it was me, something that...
that I did.

32:25.711 --> 32:28.480
Or just me, but this...

32:30.516 --> 32:32.227
I hate that she had to go
through this all alone.

32:32.251 --> 32:33.552
Clem didn't leave

32:33.585 --> 32:36.255
because of anything you did.

32:36.288 --> 32:37.623
And she wasn't alone.

32:42.361 --> 32:43.462
Everything okay?

32:43.495 --> 32:45.631
Perfect. You're an exact match.

32:54.540 --> 32:57.476
That's all you need to help the baby?
My blood? Yes.

32:57.509 --> 32:59.445
This transfusion
will allow your son

32:59.478 --> 33:00.246
to develop and grow.

33:00.279 --> 33:04.616
My son.
How is that even possible?

33:04.650 --> 33:06.052
I don't know.

33:06.085 --> 33:08.720
Clearly,
there is something unique

33:08.754 --> 33:11.690
about the two of you.

33:27.373 --> 33:30.542
Okay, once I open this port,

33:30.576 --> 33:33.345
the stasis tank will
regulate the flow

33:33.379 --> 33:36.048
of your blood directly
into the umbilical system.

33:36.082 --> 33:38.384
Are you ready?

33:40.319 --> 33:41.753
Okay.

34:02.808 --> 34:04.576
What's happening?

34:04.610 --> 34:07.179
The baby...

34:07.213 --> 34:08.523
it's having an adverse reaction.

34:08.547 --> 34:10.449
You said I was an exact match.

34:10.482 --> 34:11.483
You are.

34:26.197 --> 34:27.565
JARED: Hello, Abigail.

34:33.539 --> 34:35.741
I've waited a long
time for this.

34:39.745 --> 34:41.612
What the hell is that thing?

34:41.647 --> 34:44.116
Shepherd tech.
It's tracking Mitch's bio-drive.

34:48.853 --> 34:50.188
MAX: Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

34:56.594 --> 34:58.630
Mitch?
Mitch, I know you're in there.

34:58.664 --> 35:00.432
Please don't do this.

35:02.768 --> 35:04.170
Okay, we need a new plan. Here.

35:04.203 --> 35:06.438
Wait, Ja... Jamie!

35:09.508 --> 35:11.643
Don't do it, Mitch.

35:11.677 --> 35:12.778
Don't do it.

35:20.652 --> 35:22.254
You think I won't shoot you?

35:22.288 --> 35:23.622
I think you're out of ammo.

35:23.655 --> 35:26.758
I counted 17 rounds.

35:26.792 --> 35:28.527
Unless I'm mistaken.

35:30.529 --> 35:31.663
(pistol dry-clicks)

35:31.697 --> 35:33.699
(grunting)

35:44.710 --> 35:45.710
That was incredible.

35:47.646 --> 35:50.349
I never thought he'd
pull the trigger.

35:50.382 --> 35:51.659
I was trying to tell you
that Abigail used this

35:51.683 --> 35:54.286
to activate the bio-drive.

35:54.320 --> 35:55.663
I'm pretty sure it
turns it on and off.

35:55.687 --> 35:56.622
So we can get rid of Duncan.

35:56.655 --> 35:58.224
I hope so.

35:58.257 --> 35:59.858
Look, we have to find Abigail now.
Yeah.

35:59.891 --> 36:02.294
Max, go with him...
you can cover more ground that way.

36:02.328 --> 36:03.571
No, no, you sure?
I'll help you with Mitch.

36:03.595 --> 36:05.397
No, I'll be fine. Go.

36:05.431 --> 36:06.898
Okay, okay.

36:18.810 --> 36:20.912
Are the chem-packs
locked and loaded?

36:20.946 --> 36:22.714
The basement levels
were sealed off

36:22.748 --> 36:25.751
because of flooding...
We just gained access.

36:25.784 --> 36:26.785
And?

36:29.988 --> 36:33.759
Corporal... what is it?

36:33.792 --> 36:35.727
You're gonna have to
see this for yourself.

36:44.836 --> 36:46.938
There's got to be a control
room here somewhere.

36:46.972 --> 36:48.740
This place is a maze.

36:49.908 --> 36:51.277
All right, look, Max,

36:51.310 --> 36:52.578
we got to split up.

36:52.611 --> 36:54.131
I'm gonna take
upstairs, you take down.

37:05.791 --> 37:07.826
(breathing heavily)

37:16.001 --> 37:19.237
Hands up. Up, up.

37:30.449 --> 37:32.050
What does all this do?

37:32.083 --> 37:33.819
You wouldn't understand.

37:33.852 --> 37:35.387
Probably not.

37:41.927 --> 37:44.596
(gunshots)

37:51.437 --> 37:53.872
Now I don't need to.

37:53.905 --> 37:56.575
It doesn't matter.

37:56.608 --> 37:58.410
It's just circuits and wires.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.713
My hybrids are so much more.

38:01.747 --> 38:03.482
Your hybrids?

38:03.515 --> 38:06.452
We Shepherds had a plan.

38:06.485 --> 38:10.389
Curtail the human population,
allow the animals to thrive.

38:10.422 --> 38:12.358
It was simple, necessary.

38:12.391 --> 38:13.859
That plan was flawed.

38:13.892 --> 38:15.794
But you're the last
person on Earth

38:15.827 --> 38:17.829
that I would expect
to understand that.

38:20.932 --> 38:24.035
Back at Pangaea,
there was only one hybrid...

38:24.069 --> 38:25.404
Razorbacks.

38:25.437 --> 38:27.873
But you went and
created five more.

38:27.906 --> 38:29.341
Why?

38:29.375 --> 38:30.842
What are you planning?

38:30.876 --> 38:33.044
Thought that was obvious.

38:33.078 --> 38:35.747
My hybrids are gonna
take over the world.

38:35.781 --> 38:37.649
Don't play dumb right now.

38:37.683 --> 38:39.117
I know there's more
to it than that.

38:39.150 --> 38:41.487
I'm not gonna ask you again.

38:41.520 --> 38:44.823
What are you planning on
doing with the hybrids?

38:44.856 --> 38:49.795
Even if you knew,
there's no stopping it.

38:53.098 --> 38:55.367
Wrong answer.

38:55.401 --> 38:56.134
JACKSON: No!

38:56.167 --> 38:58.737
(grunting)

39:25.464 --> 39:26.798
(gunshots)

39:27.799 --> 39:30.035
(gasping)

39:32.170 --> 39:33.772
Don't look at me like that.

39:33.805 --> 39:36.107
I didn't save you
because I care.

39:36.141 --> 39:38.410
I saved you because I'm
not done with you yet.

39:57.896 --> 39:59.998
JACKSON: No, no, no.

40:00.031 --> 40:02.968
Hey, guys, I need help here.

40:03.001 --> 40:04.970
I got Abigail here,
but she's in bad shape.

40:05.003 --> 40:06.848
I was trying to get a
spinal sample fluid, but...

40:06.872 --> 40:10.509
Guys, I need help.
I need help now.

40:10.542 --> 40:11.510
JAMIE: Copy that.

40:11.543 --> 40:14.012
Help is on the way.

40:17.248 --> 40:19.751
(breathing heavily)

40:27.559 --> 40:30.896
Oh... (exhales) Jamie...

40:30.929 --> 40:32.230
Did it work?

40:32.263 --> 40:35.501
Yeah, it worked.

40:35.534 --> 40:37.903
Welcome back, son.

40:39.270 --> 40:40.706
Where's Jackson?

40:40.739 --> 40:42.541
I found every dead
end down here.

40:42.574 --> 40:44.009
He must be upstairs.

40:44.042 --> 40:46.845
Come on.

40:46.878 --> 40:48.947
Here.

40:53.585 --> 40:56.855
What are you doing?

40:56.888 --> 40:58.156
Why did you lie to him?

40:58.189 --> 41:00.225
You have the bio-drive switch.

41:00.258 --> 41:01.960
Why don't you just use it?

41:01.993 --> 41:03.962
Because I don't need
Mitch right now,

41:03.995 --> 41:05.764
I need Mr. Duncan.

41:05.797 --> 41:08.534
So keep your mouth shut
and do what I tell you.

41:08.567 --> 41:11.537
You're gonna do something
that Mitch would never do.

41:11.570 --> 41:14.506
Go.

41:28.019 --> 41:29.555
(grunts)

41:30.589 --> 41:33.091
Be careful.

41:36.595 --> 41:37.829
Do you think we'll be able

41:37.863 --> 41:39.865
to get the teams and
equipment down here?

41:39.898 --> 41:42.734
The engineers are
working on that now.

41:47.138 --> 41:48.239
Come on.

41:51.242 --> 41:52.243
We're almost there.

42:06.692 --> 42:08.259
Oh, my God.
