Boat leaves in ten minutes, Pop.

00:29.847 --> 00:33.329
I've never been late
in my life, Francis.

00:37.382 --> 00:39.002
I can't find my iPod.

00:39.003 --> 00:39.922
Kitchen.

00:39.923 --> 00:41.472
And the skirt... really?

00:55.051 --> 00:56.556
Danny? Yeah?

00:56.557 --> 00:58.181
Honey, the kids are in the car.

00:58.182 --> 00:59.248
All right, babe.

00:59.249 --> 01:00.653
You know the Verrazano
at this hour.

01:00.654 --> 01:02.837
Yeah. I'm coming.

01:47.784 --> 01:52.164
Start spreading the news

01:52.165 --> 01:56.594
I'm leaving today

01:56.595 --> 02:01.378
I want to be a part of it.

02:01.379 --> 02:05.759
New York, New York.

02:05.760 --> 02:10.021
These vagabond shoes.

02:10.023 --> 02:14.495
Are longing to stray

02:14.496 --> 02:18.935
Right through the very heart of it

02:18.936 --> 02:23.682
New York, New York

02:23.683 --> 02:26.354
If I can

02:26.355 --> 02:28.156
Make it there

02:28.157 --> 02:31.158
I'll make it

02:31.159 --> 02:32.753
Anywhere

02:32.754 --> 02:35.384
It's up to you

02:35.385 --> 02:37.596
New York

02:37.597 --> 02:40.403
New York

02:40.404 --> 02:42.679
It is without profound
praise and gratitude

02:42.680 --> 02:45.503
that I welcome you
new police officers,

02:45.504 --> 02:47.919
proud that you have
answered the call to service

02:47.920 --> 02:52.135
and today join the ranks
of New York's finest.

02:52.136 --> 02:54.561
You have earned the distinction
of being the best trained,

02:54.562 --> 02:57.139
best prepared police
officers in the world,

02:57.140 --> 02:59.390
ready to serve and protect

02:59.391 --> 03:01.908
the most vibrant
city in the world,

03:01.909 --> 03:03.996
where every day brings
a responsibility

03:03.997 --> 03:06.357
to keep all New Yorkers safe...

03:06.358 --> 03:08.574
safe from crime...

03:08.575 --> 03:11.113
and safe from terrorism.

03:11.114 --> 03:12.390
And though the city is

03:12.391 --> 03:15.957
on the very cutting edge
of technology, nothing...

03:15.958 --> 03:17.937
replaces your unwavering sense

03:17.938 --> 03:20.103
of right and wrong

03:20.104 --> 03:23.959
and your eyes and
ears on the street.

03:23.960 --> 03:26.495
And we remain safe

03:26.496 --> 03:29.956
because of the hard
work and dedication

03:29.957 --> 03:31.406
of the men and women

03:31.407 --> 03:34.561
of the New York City
Police Department.

03:34.562 --> 03:37.369
Now, we all wear the
same blue uniform,

03:37.370 --> 03:39.253
carry the same shield.

03:39.254 --> 03:42.109
Now you are a part of
the finest police force

03:42.110 --> 03:44.151
in the world.

03:44.152 --> 03:46.566
Congratulations to your families,

03:46.567 --> 03:48.180
your friends,

03:48.181 --> 03:50.483
and congratulations to you,

03:50.484 --> 03:51.733
our new...

03:51.734 --> 03:54.017
New York City police officers.

03:54.018 --> 03:57.517
If I can make it there

03:57.518 --> 04:00.109
I'm gonna make it

04:00.110 --> 04:02.214
Anywhere

04:02.215 --> 04:05.222
It's up to you

04:05.223 --> 04:08.246
New York

04:08.247 --> 04:13.882

04:44.658 --> 04:45.694
I'm not an invalid.

04:45.695 --> 04:47.798
I had a hip replacement.

04:47.799 --> 04:50.291
Mr. Mayor.

04:50.292 --> 04:51.691
Inspiring words, Frank.

04:51.692 --> 04:53.011
Hey, Dave.

04:53.012 --> 04:54.418
But we miss you up at the 64.

04:54.419 --> 04:57.131
I don't miss you guys.

05:01.924 --> 05:02.768
How the hell are you supposed

05:02.769 --> 05:04.438
to find anybody in this mess?

05:04.439 --> 05:05.388
Dad!

05:05.389 --> 05:07.698
Hey. Grandpa, over here!

05:08.826 --> 05:10.851
Great speech, Dad.

05:12.769 --> 05:14.887
Hi. Hey.

05:14.888 --> 05:16.775
Hey, Grandpa.
I'm proud of you, son.

05:16.776 --> 05:18.558
Thanks, Dad.

05:21.936 --> 05:23.786
You looked great up there.

05:24.784 --> 05:26.476
Mom's probably
spinning in her grave,

05:26.477 --> 05:28.225
you quitting the law and
becoming a cop and all.

05:28.226 --> 05:30.791
Danny. I'm just sayin'.

05:30.792 --> 05:33.111
Golden boy was on the
fast track to Washington.

05:33.112 --> 05:34.428
Now look at him.

05:34.429 --> 05:35.975
Just like the rest of us Reagans...

05:35.976 --> 05:37.067
another boot in a suit.

05:37.068 --> 05:38.454
Don't must my chops, Danny.

05:38.455 --> 05:41.267
Excuse me, all the Reagans?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sis.

05:41.268 --> 05:43.468
I forgot we got an assistant
district attorney

05:43.469 --> 05:46.256
in the family-
I'm so proud of you, sis.

05:46.257 --> 05:47.783
We'd have another lawyer
in the family if these two

05:47.784 --> 05:51.027
would set a date.
What, and spoil all the fun?

05:51.028 --> 05:52.562
Hey, Reagan, we made it.

05:52.563 --> 05:53.729
Yeah!

05:53.730 --> 05:55.029
Congratulations, boss.

05:55.030 --> 05:56.426
Dad, this is Officer Romano.

05:56.427 --> 05:58.950
First woman recruit to win
the sharpshooter medal.

05:58.951 --> 06:00.472
Well done. Thank you, sir.

06:00.473 --> 06:02.959
I just wanted to say hello.

06:02.960 --> 06:03.951
You must be...

06:03.952 --> 06:06.334
Sydney, right? Congratulations.

06:06.335 --> 06:08.333
Thanks. I'll see
you around, Reagan.

06:08.334 --> 06:09.881
Okay.

06:13.722 --> 06:15.559
She won the sharpshooter medal.

06:15.560 --> 06:17.094
Your father said.

06:17.095 --> 06:18.767
Well, the gang's all here.

06:18.768 --> 06:20.139
I guess we should be getting over

06:20.140 --> 06:22.037
to the Breslin. Oh, sorry,

06:22.038 --> 06:23.972
but first-year associates
don't get lunch.

06:23.973 --> 06:26.185
I'm lucky they let
me out for this.

06:26.186 --> 06:28.259
It was amazing.

06:29.960 --> 06:30.790
Okay.

06:30.791 --> 06:31.835
Bye, everybody. Love you.

06:31.836 --> 06:33.911
Bye. Bye, Sidney.

06:33.912 --> 06:36.951
She seems to be handling this well,
you being a cop.

06:36.952 --> 06:38.566
We're working on it.

06:38.567 --> 06:42.376
It can't be easy after
watching you bury your brother.

06:45.947 --> 06:48.604
Joe died doing what
he loved to do.

06:48.605 --> 06:49.640
Little brother,

06:49.641 --> 06:51.447
I'm gonna have to buy
you a beer another time.

06:51.448 --> 06:53.113
I got a missing kid. Got to go.

06:53.114 --> 06:55.189
You up to catch a case? Yeah, Dad.

06:55.190 --> 06:56.570
Demarcus is on his way.

06:56.571 --> 06:57.990
I'll see you guys later.

06:57.991 --> 06:59.430
Bye. Bye, boys.

06:59.431 --> 07:01.190
Bye. Bye.

07:16.958 --> 07:19.311
Little girl... I don't
like the sound of it.

07:19.312 --> 07:20.857
Your glass half empty much?

07:20.858 --> 07:22.313
I mean, she could turn
up at a friend's house.

07:22.314 --> 07:24.917
Yeah, but, then,
why'd they call us?

07:30.578 --> 07:32.294
Smile for the cameras, Danny boy.

07:32.295 --> 07:36.727
All right, all right, all right.

07:36.728 --> 07:37.751
What do we got?

07:37.752 --> 07:39.764
Nine-year-old female Hispanic,

07:39.765 --> 07:42.342
Teresa Campos,
didn't come home from school,

07:42.343 --> 07:44.403
St. Anita up the block.

07:44.404 --> 07:45.640
The mother there got worried,

07:45.641 --> 07:46.648
went looking for her,

07:46.649 --> 07:48.412
and the building super told her

07:48.413 --> 07:50.645
he saw a couple of young
boys grab a pink backpack

07:50.646 --> 07:54.242
from the gutter here and run
off with it. Backpack hers?

07:54.243 --> 07:55.872
You find the kids who
found the backpack?

07:55.873 --> 07:58.506
Not yet. I got Housing doing
verticals in the projects,

07:58.507 --> 08:00.189
and aviation's en route
to check rooftops.

08:00.190 --> 08:02.005
Anybody see anything else?

08:02.006 --> 08:04.854
This doll was found near
where the backpack was.

08:04.855 --> 08:07.659
One of those ones you
press it and it talks.

08:07.660 --> 08:11.484
Change me. I'm wet.

08:13.483 --> 08:15.536
Anyway, the mother said
she never seen it before.

08:15.537 --> 08:18.131
All right, voucher it and get
prints and serology on it, okay?

08:18.132 --> 08:20.521
Let's put out an AMBER Alert request,
get a canvass going.

08:20.522 --> 08:21.488
There's a lot of cameras around.

08:21.489 --> 08:22.682
Check the surveillance video,
clear out

08:22.683 --> 08:24.573
all the apartment Dumpsters,
mailboxes, drains,

08:24.574 --> 08:25.802
sewers, everything-
just try not to let

08:25.803 --> 08:28.596
the family see what you're doing,
okay? Gotcha.

08:28.597 --> 08:29.950
You know that feeling
you were getting?

08:29.951 --> 08:33.477
Yeah. I'm getting it, too.

08:33.479 --> 08:35.217
Mr. And Mrs. Campos,
I'm Detective Reagan.

08:35.219 --> 08:37.409
This is my partner,
Detective King.

08:37.410 --> 08:40.506
We understand your
daughter went missing.

08:40.506 --> 08:42.647
Um... I'm gonna have to
ask you a few questions.

08:42.648 --> 08:43.878
She always comes home.

08:43.879 --> 08:46.023
She comes home every day.

08:46.024 --> 08:47.569
She knows her mother worries.

08:47.570 --> 08:48.985
She's a good girl.

08:48.986 --> 08:50.014
I'm sure she is... I know

08:50.015 --> 08:51.601
how difficult this
must be for you.

08:51.602 --> 08:53.308
Is it possible she
may have run away?

08:53.309 --> 08:56.193
Maybe you had a fight,
maybe an ex-husband may have taken her.

08:56.194 --> 08:57.418
Rigo's her father.

08:57.419 --> 08:59.423
There was no fight.

08:59.424 --> 09:01.768
Where is she?
You have to find her.

09:01.769 --> 09:03.241
The more you can tell us,
Mrs. Campos,

09:03.242 --> 09:04.270
the more we can help.

09:04.271 --> 09:07.245
Detective, can I talk to you?
Excuse me.

09:09.272 --> 09:10.534
Woman there saw a white van

09:10.535 --> 09:12.941
pull away from the
curb here really crazy.

09:12.942 --> 09:15.419
White van in New York City?
That narrows it down.

09:15.420 --> 09:16.883
Yeah, I know... she didn't
get the plates, either,

09:16.884 --> 09:18.472
but she said it had a
cracked rear window.

09:18.473 --> 09:19.713
All right, let's put the
van out on the wire,

09:19.714 --> 09:22.202
notify bridge and tunnel security-
maybe we'll get lucky.

09:22.203 --> 09:25.639
Change me. I'm wet.

09:25.640 --> 09:28.312
I'm thinking this isn't a simple
custodial dispute, partner.

09:28.313 --> 09:30.891
Yeah. Doesn't smell like
a ransom case, either.

09:30.892 --> 09:32.338
Yeah, but we got another problem.

09:32.339 --> 09:33.516
Little girl's a diabetic.

09:33.517 --> 09:35.974
She gets insulin
shots every 24 hours.

09:35.975 --> 09:36.929
So if she doesn't get 'em...

09:36.930 --> 09:38.000
My baby...

09:38.001 --> 09:40.190
Please! You have to find her!

09:40.191 --> 09:41.630
We'll do all we can.

09:41.631 --> 09:43.770
We'll do all we can, ma'am.

09:43.771 --> 09:45.677
It's all right, it's all right.

09:45.678 --> 09:48.420
Oh, my baby! It's all right.

09:51.060 --> 09:52.785
Help...

09:54.694 --> 09:56.561
Commissioner Reagan!
Commissioner Reagan!

09:56.562 --> 09:58.468
Commissioner Reagan! Commissioner!

09:58.469 --> 10:00.633
All right, before I
take questions...

10:02.069 --> 10:05.224
As you all know,
the first hours are crucial

10:05.225 --> 10:08.850
in a case like this,
so I'm asking for the media's help

10:08.851 --> 10:11.469
in keeping Teresa's
face before the public.

10:11.470 --> 10:13.934
Our task force will respond
to each and every lead,

10:13.935 --> 10:17.002
and I assure you the New
York City Police Department

10:17.003 --> 10:20.652
will not rest till we
find this little girl.

10:20.653 --> 10:21.626
Miguel.

10:21.627 --> 10:22.911
Commissioner Reagan,
what do you say

10:22.912 --> 10:25.473
to blog allegations there's
a third fewer police than

10:25.474 --> 10:28.121
on the Allie Dintenfass AMBER
Alert on the Upper East Side

10:28.122 --> 10:29.861
last summer?

10:29.862 --> 10:31.327
Miguel, you're a
professional journalist.

10:31.328 --> 10:32.541
Do you really want
to give credence

10:32.542 --> 10:34.836
to any amateur blogger
with a laptop?

10:34.837 --> 10:36.694
Then what is your response
to polls that show

10:36.695 --> 10:39.512
an endemic lack of faith in
police by the Latino community

10:39.513 --> 10:40.935
and a slow and steady rise

10:40.936 --> 10:42.255
in crime there?

10:42.256 --> 10:44.749
I don't respond to polls,
Miss Davidson.

10:44.750 --> 10:46.958
But since I've been on the job,
crime is down

10:46.959 --> 10:48.349
across the board.

10:48.350 --> 10:50.670
So you're claiming that the
mayor's budgetary cutbacks

10:50.671 --> 10:52.161
aren't affecting the
department's ability

10:52.162 --> 10:54.709
to keep all citizens
of this city safe?

10:54.710 --> 10:57.094
None of us is concerned
about cost today.

10:57.095 --> 11:00.237
A nine-year-old girl is missing,
and the clock is ticking.

11:00.238 --> 11:01.700
We need to find Teresa.

11:01.701 --> 11:04.022
Just make sure you media
people do your job

11:04.023 --> 11:05.684
and keep her face
before the public.

11:05.685 --> 11:07.736
Next question.

11:09.506 --> 11:10.855
Tony.

11:18.886 --> 11:20.080
What a world.

11:20.081 --> 11:23.855
16. 16 registered sex offenders

11:23.856 --> 11:25.628
within a five-block radius
of this girl's home.

11:25.629 --> 11:26.633
What have you got for me, partner?

11:26.634 --> 11:28.483
Tip on a white van with a
little girl in Astoria,

11:28.484 --> 11:30.175
but it was just an Asian family.

11:30.176 --> 11:31.508
All right, it's going
to be a long night.

11:31.509 --> 11:33.337
Let's get to work.

11:36.718 --> 11:40.182
Hey, caught your news
conference on the kidnap, Frank.

11:40.183 --> 11:42.038
It was a nice job.

11:42.039 --> 11:44.121
Come in.

11:45.747 --> 11:48.473
You know, Frank,
we got to find this kid.

11:48.474 --> 11:49.568
Alive.

11:49.569 --> 11:51.784
We're doing everything we can,
Mr. Mayor.

11:51.785 --> 11:54.012
That better be good enough.

11:54.013 --> 11:56.781
I hear your boy is lead detective?

11:56.782 --> 11:57.702
If you're talking about

11:57.703 --> 11:59.783
Detective First
Grade Daniel Reagan,

11:59.784 --> 12:01.313
I heard that, too.

12:01.314 --> 12:02.647
You think that's wise, Frank?

12:02.648 --> 12:03.661
Could be exposing yourself

12:03.662 --> 12:05.970
to all kinds of scrutiny
if it goes south.

12:05.971 --> 12:07.930
You're popular with the public,

12:07.931 --> 12:09.066
but I don't have to tell you,

12:09.067 --> 12:10.577
you don't have a lot of
friends in high places

12:10.578 --> 12:11.593
to back you up.

12:11.594 --> 12:15.300
I don't spend a lot of
time worrying about that.

12:15.301 --> 12:18.738
Well, maybe you should.

12:20.955 --> 12:22.502
Oh, yeah, and another thing.

12:22.503 --> 12:24.335
The attitude with
the press and that

12:24.336 --> 12:27.074
little sound bite about how
since you've been chief

12:27.075 --> 12:29.291
and the crime stats decreasing.

12:29.292 --> 12:32.094
There is no future in that
kind of grandstanding.

12:32.095 --> 12:34.770
Just ask your old man.

12:41.878 --> 12:42.831
Reagan.

12:42.832 --> 12:44.013
It occurred to me that

12:44.014 --> 12:45.195
with all you've got on your plate,

12:45.196 --> 12:46.286
you might not have time

12:46.287 --> 12:48.710
to drop off the roast
for Sunday dinner.

12:48.711 --> 12:50.158
You calling about the roast,

12:50.159 --> 12:52.989
or are you looking
for an update, Dad?

12:54.591 --> 12:56.232
Well, speaking as your boss,

12:56.233 --> 12:59.241
I hope you know you have
all the resources you need.

12:59.242 --> 13:01.006
Well, I appreciate that, boss.

13:01.007 --> 13:03.908
I'll keep you posted.

13:03.909 --> 13:04.750
What's up, Reagan?

13:04.751 --> 13:06.466
Motivational call from my old man.

13:06.467 --> 13:07.541
What about you? Yeah.

13:07.542 --> 13:09.071
It's not great news.

13:09.072 --> 13:11.852
RTCC's data mine of our
girl's neighborhood?

13:11.853 --> 13:13.272
The sketchy-ass
uncle's been locked up

13:13.273 --> 13:15.198
on Rikers Island for DWI.

13:15.199 --> 13:18.739
You know, I had such
high hopes for that man.

13:21.186 --> 13:23.994
I just keep thinking
about that girl.

13:23.995 --> 13:27.819
Imagine how afraid she is,
how afraid her family is.

13:33.448 --> 13:35.128
Where's the doll?

13:35.129 --> 13:36.281
We need the doll.

13:36.282 --> 13:38.734
Why? The lab didn't pull
anything from it. No DNA.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.381
No prints.
Yeah, but that's just it.

13:40.382 --> 13:41.951
I mean, if the doll
belonged to another girl,

13:41.952 --> 13:43.202
then why is it so clean?

13:43.203 --> 13:45.552
I mean, there's no prints,
no DNA, no nothing. Why?

13:45.553 --> 13:49.860
Well, 'cause maybe...
maybe they wore gloves.

13:49.861 --> 13:52.494
And they used it as bait
to lure the girl in.

13:52.495 --> 13:55.076
Exactly. All right,
there's got to be a label or a stamp

13:55.077 --> 13:56.592
or something on the doll.
Let's find out

13:56.593 --> 13:57.793
who makes it, where they sell it.

13:57.794 --> 13:59.673
Maybe this talking doll
can tell us something.

13:59.674 --> 14:00.613
All right.

14:00.614 --> 14:02.621
Give me the Evidence Room.

14:09.889 --> 14:12.524
Had to be China, right?

14:12.525 --> 14:14.365
They're trying to find
someone who speaks English.

14:14.366 --> 14:16.045
What is it over there,
tomorrow or yesterday?

14:16.046 --> 14:17.260
Yes. Hello.

14:17.261 --> 14:19.679
Yeah, this is Detective Reagan,
New York Police.

14:19.680 --> 14:21.447
Yeah, your Dolly Change Me doll...

14:21.448 --> 14:25.330
I need to know where it's sold
in the Eastern United States.

14:25.331 --> 14:27.806
You what?

14:27.807 --> 14:30.509
Are you sure?

14:30.510 --> 14:32.825
Okay. All right.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

14:32.826 --> 14:34.792
I need you to give me
the names and addresses

14:34.793 --> 14:38.027
of anyone who had access
to one of these dolls.

14:38.028 --> 14:40.048
No, no, no. No call back.

14:40.049 --> 14:41.567
I don't have time for
you to call back.

14:41.568 --> 14:43.811
You put me on hold, I'll wait.
What's going on?

14:43.812 --> 14:45.914
The doll... it's a...
it's a prototype.

14:45.915 --> 14:48.120
It's not even for sale yet.
They made it for test marketing.

14:48.121 --> 14:49.126
Three.

14:49.127 --> 14:50.525
Three people.

14:50.526 --> 14:52.596
Only three people
have these dolls.

14:52.597 --> 14:54.258
What are their names?

14:54.259 --> 14:56.692
The haystack just got
a little smaller.

15:02.585 --> 15:04.996
Jim, I'll need to talk to the
chief at Manhattan South.

15:04.997 --> 15:06.848
I've got a call in to see
if there's any progress

15:06.849 --> 15:08.084
on the kidnapping case.

15:08.085 --> 15:08.862
There's nothing solid yet.

15:08.863 --> 15:11.354
They're working on a new lead.

15:13.211 --> 15:16.179
Yeah. All right.

15:16.180 --> 15:17.294
Yeah.

15:17.295 --> 15:19.111
They found one of the
three sample dolls.

15:19.112 --> 15:21.104
Belongs to a UN delegate
who's over in Shanghai.

15:21.105 --> 15:23.007
She's still over
there with the doll.

15:23.008 --> 15:25.488
And doll number two is
supposed to be in this dump?

15:25.489 --> 15:28.755
Rats in Staten Island
live better than this.

15:53.072 --> 15:54.085
Who's there?

15:54.086 --> 15:57.301
Police. Open the door.

15:57.302 --> 15:58.883
You Oliver Peele?

15:58.884 --> 15:59.749
Yeah.

15:59.750 --> 16:00.829
We need to come inside.

16:00.830 --> 16:02.062
Why? What's going on?

16:02.063 --> 16:04.418
Step inside.

16:07.483 --> 16:09.193
What is this place? OLIVER: What?

16:09.194 --> 16:12.108
Mind turning down the music?

16:12.109 --> 16:15.124
Man, this is crazy.

16:15.125 --> 16:17.560
Hey, little girl... Hey!

16:17.561 --> 16:19.133
Little girl went missing
yesterday afternoon.

16:19.134 --> 16:20.211
Where were you?

16:20.212 --> 16:22.419
Here probably.

16:22.420 --> 16:24.525
You got anybody to verify that?

16:24.526 --> 16:26.185
Wait a minute.

16:26.186 --> 16:27.397
Hey, Reagan?

16:27.398 --> 16:28.342
Change me. The sample.

16:28.343 --> 16:30.120
I'm wet. He has his. It's not him.

16:30.121 --> 16:32.461
Hey, you can't take that.
I'm not done with it yet.

16:32.462 --> 16:33.822
Be my guest.

16:33.823 --> 16:35.103
Let's go.

16:35.104 --> 16:36.745
Aren't you a little old
to be playing with dolls?

16:36.746 --> 16:41.757
I'm a reviewer for World
of Dolls Magazine?

16:44.409 --> 16:46.077
I know what you're thinking,

16:46.078 --> 16:48.840
but mothers rely on me.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.899
Reagan. We found it?

16:50.900 --> 16:52.549
Hey, doll number three.

16:52.550 --> 16:54.207
Toy salesman named Donald Banse.

16:54.208 --> 16:55.965
No, that's great.
Put it out there. Yeah.

16:55.966 --> 16:57.027
What'd they get?

16:57.028 --> 16:58.364
He's got a Florida
driver's license,

16:58.365 --> 16:59.728
so we got prints and
his picture now.

16:59.729 --> 17:01.105
Any local address?

17:01.106 --> 17:01.882
His wife's got

17:01.883 --> 17:02.835
a New York driver's license

17:02.836 --> 17:04.654
with an address right
in our own backyard.

17:06.039 --> 17:09.185
Should I radio in,
let 'em know we're back in service?

17:09.186 --> 17:12.593
Could you give me a minute
to drink my coffee, kid?

17:12.594 --> 17:14.265
You know, I was also
your brother Joe's

17:14.266 --> 17:15.923
training officer when
he was a new boot?

17:15.924 --> 17:18.794
No kidding? No,
I didn't know that.

17:18.795 --> 17:20.123
Yeah.

17:20.124 --> 17:22.116
Terrible thing, he got shot.

17:22.117 --> 17:24.298
He was a good guy, your brother.

17:24.299 --> 17:26.084
Yeah, he was.

17:26.085 --> 17:28.009
Good guy.

17:28.010 --> 17:29.682
So, I hear you went to Harvard.

17:29.683 --> 17:31.172
What are you doing on the beat?

17:31.173 --> 17:33.222
Trying to see how the
real people live?

17:33.223 --> 17:34.405
Writing a book?

17:34.406 --> 17:35.617
It's in the blood, I suppose.

17:35.618 --> 17:36.772
Well, Harvard,

17:36.773 --> 17:38.299
that's something we're
gonna have to find out.

17:38.300 --> 17:40.065
Don't think just 'cause
your old man is the boss,

17:40.066 --> 17:42.096
I'm going to be
cutting you any slack.

17:42.097 --> 17:43.976
You're going to have to earn
it just like everybody else.

17:43.977 --> 17:47.107
Yeah. Yeah, Joe was a sweetheart.

17:47.108 --> 17:49.056
Now, your brother Danny,
on the other hand...

17:49.057 --> 17:50.312
Danny's Danny.

17:50.313 --> 17:53.785
Hey, Harvard, I got the last word.

17:53.786 --> 17:55.142
Okay? Yeah.

17:55.143 --> 17:56.176
31 George,

17:56.177 --> 17:58.618
reports of a female calling
for help, West 4-5.

17:58.619 --> 17:59.598
That's us.

17:59.599 --> 18:00.793
Seems to be in distress...

18:00.794 --> 18:02.305
What are you looking at me for?

18:02.306 --> 18:04.532
Get in the car! Go ahead.

18:16.150 --> 18:18.554
I'm not seeing a white van.

18:23.810 --> 18:25.421
Mildred Banse?

18:26.973 --> 18:27.785
Yeah.

18:27.786 --> 18:28.558
Can I help you?

18:28.559 --> 18:30.334
We need to talk to your
husband. Is he home?

18:30.335 --> 18:32.684
No. No. Why?

18:32.685 --> 18:33.689
What's he done?

18:33.690 --> 18:35.200
We just need to talk to him,
that's all.

18:35.201 --> 18:36.764
Do you mind if we look inside?

18:36.765 --> 18:38.398
I'm telling you,
I haven't seen him in months.

18:38.399 --> 18:39.994
I'm-I'm divorcing the bastard.

18:39.995 --> 18:43.770
I just sent him the last box
of his stuff. Oh, yeah? Where?

18:45.078 --> 18:47.236
Inwood. The Lincoln Arms.

18:47.237 --> 18:49.982
But I don't know if
he's still there.

18:55.088 --> 18:57.328
How much longer we got with this
diabetes thing? Couple hours?

18:57.329 --> 18:59.488
If that. Teresa's type 1 diabetes.

18:59.489 --> 19:01.039
She could die of insulin shock.

19:01.040 --> 19:03.605
Right up here.
Right ahead on the right.

19:04.522 --> 19:07.133
Lincoln Arms Hotel. Right there.

19:13.602 --> 19:16.420
No white van. Blue van.

19:16.421 --> 19:18.522
Yeah?

19:20.399 --> 19:23.653
Maybe white van, blue paint job.

19:29.376 --> 19:30.490
There's something inside.

19:30.491 --> 19:32.282
Yeah, and he fixed the
crack in the window.

19:32.283 --> 19:34.860
Gonna have to fix this one, too.

19:37.162 --> 19:38.925
She's not here.

19:41.293 --> 19:42.744
What's this?

19:45.892 --> 19:46.993
A communion dress.

19:46.994 --> 19:48.777
Votive candles. The good news is,

19:48.778 --> 19:50.642
he didn't light 'em yet.
Let's check inside.

19:50.643 --> 19:52.380
Close it up.

20:05.069 --> 20:07.198
Police. Open up.

20:08.642 --> 20:10.293
Donald Banse? Yes, I am.

20:10.294 --> 20:12.670
How can I help you? Hey.
We're coming inside. Step aside.

20:12.671 --> 20:15.552
He's packing his bags.
You going somewhere?

20:15.553 --> 20:17.568
Hey, where's the little girl?

20:17.569 --> 20:18.687
I don't know what
you're talking about.

20:18.688 --> 20:19.889
Yeah, you do. When you
snatched her off the street,

20:19.890 --> 20:21.361
you dropped your sample
doll in the gutter.

20:21.362 --> 20:22.257
Now, where is she?

20:22.258 --> 20:23.470
A doll was stolen from my van.

20:23.471 --> 20:25.062
I was gonna give it to my
niece for her first communion.

20:25.063 --> 20:26.451
Oh, you mean the van
that you had painted blue

20:26.452 --> 20:27.584
and changed the cracked window on?

20:27.585 --> 20:28.738
You know what? I don't
even have to talk to you.

20:28.739 --> 20:30.297
I know my rights.
Don't talk to us then.

20:30.298 --> 20:31.376
What are you doing?

20:31.377 --> 20:33.086
Up against the wall.
Are you arresting me?

20:33.087 --> 20:35.054
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say

20:35.055 --> 20:36.781
may be used against you
in a court of law...

20:36.782 --> 20:38.273
Fine, fine. Good.
Take me downtown.

20:38.274 --> 20:40.102
My lawyer will have
me out in an hour.

20:40.103 --> 20:42.716
Then maybe I will
see my little niece.

20:44.226 --> 20:46.726
What did you say?

20:46.727 --> 20:48.151
Hey, hey, hey, come on.

20:48.152 --> 20:49.917
Come here. Come here. Get off me!

20:49.918 --> 20:50.965
Danny, let's take him downtown.

20:50.966 --> 20:53.081
Oh, get off me! Oh!
Let's take him downtown.

20:53.082 --> 20:54.141
Go outside and call it in.

20:54.142 --> 20:55.392
Reagan, let's take him downtown.

20:55.393 --> 20:57.193
We don't have time.
The girl needs insulin.

20:57.194 --> 20:58.899
Go outside and call it in!

20:58.900 --> 21:01.098
Hey, you gonna tell
me where she is?

21:01.099 --> 21:03.614
Huh? All right, get in there.

21:03.615 --> 21:06.168
Get in there!

21:06.169 --> 21:07.291
Where is she?

21:07.292 --> 21:08.735
Go to hell.

21:08.736 --> 21:10.426
You first.

21:15.425 --> 21:17.040
I'm gonna give you one last
chance to tell me where she is.

21:17.041 --> 21:19.057
Right now. I don't know.

21:19.058 --> 21:20.705
No? No?

21:22.754 --> 21:25.961
You ready to talk now? Huh?! Huh?!

21:25.962 --> 21:26.825
This storage locker

21:26.826 --> 21:29.249
we're going to,
the name he rented it under...

21:29.250 --> 21:32.220
Monsignor Nicholas,
patron saint of kids.

21:32.221 --> 21:33.841
Oh, my God, I am heartly sorry

21:33.842 --> 21:35.240
Hey, shut up you!
For having offended thee...

21:35.241 --> 21:38.767
Hey, just shut your mouth!

21:55.407 --> 21:58.343
You better hope she's still alive.

22:01.814 --> 22:03.920
Teresa?

22:08.452 --> 22:10.343
Teresa?

22:17.462 --> 22:19.323
Teresa, wake up. Wake up.

22:19.324 --> 22:20.662
No, no, no. It's okay. It's okay.

22:20.663 --> 22:22.150
You're safe now.

22:22.151 --> 22:23.920
I'm a police officer, okay?

22:23.921 --> 22:27.534
I'm going to get you home,
all right?

22:29.729 --> 22:31.870
Let me put this on you, all right?

22:31.871 --> 22:33.502
Here we go.

22:33.503 --> 22:35.624
I'm going to take this
off really quick, okay?

22:35.625 --> 22:37.785
It's going to hurt a little bit,
but hold on.

22:38.967 --> 22:40.858
Okay. All right.
You're going to come with me now.

22:40.859 --> 22:42.348
Come on.

22:42.349 --> 22:44.379
You're gonna be okay.

22:44.380 --> 22:45.577
Where's my mama?

22:45.578 --> 22:46.814
You're going to see her real soon.

22:46.815 --> 22:48.123
Come on! Where's my mama?

22:48.124 --> 22:50.248
It's okay. Listen.
These are doctors.

22:50.249 --> 22:51.834
They're going to take
you to the hospital,

22:51.835 --> 22:52.854
and your mama and papa
are going to be there

22:52.855 --> 22:53.861
waiting for you, okay?

22:53.862 --> 22:56.083
She needs insulin right away.

22:57.157 --> 22:58.953
Hey. We won one.

22:58.954 --> 23:01.158
Yeah, we did. Doesn't get
much better than that.

23:01.159 --> 23:03.016
Police brutality!

23:03.017 --> 23:04.040
He tried to drown me.

23:04.041 --> 23:05.342
This officer right here

23:05.343 --> 23:06.615
tried to drown me.

23:06.616 --> 23:09.808
He shoved my head in a toilet!

23:15.098 --> 23:16.271
Mr. Adelman,

23:16.272 --> 23:18.332
you have emergency motions
to bring in this case?

23:18.333 --> 23:20.286
Your Honor, we will be
filing a Huntley motion,

23:20.287 --> 23:21.839
that any statement my client made

23:21.840 --> 23:23.320
or any physical evidence obtained

23:23.321 --> 23:25.865
was done so through the
use of excessive force.

23:25.866 --> 23:29.858
Specifically, an officer
waterboarded my client.

23:29.859 --> 23:30.948
In a toilet.

23:30.949 --> 23:32.891
That's a serious allegation.

23:32.892 --> 23:34.834
I have photographs taken
at the time of the arrest,

23:34.835 --> 23:36.860
Your Honor.

23:36.861 --> 23:37.545
Your Honor,

23:37.546 --> 23:39.039
the officer contends
that the accused

23:39.040 --> 23:40.566
was resisting arrest.

23:40.567 --> 23:41.841
He looks pretty banged up to me.

23:41.842 --> 23:43.342
Your Honor, since all
of the State's evidence

23:43.343 --> 23:45.117
is clearly inadmissible,
our final motion

23:45.118 --> 23:46.421
is that the case be dismissed,

23:46.422 --> 23:48.818
and Mr. Banse be released
from custody immediately.

23:48.819 --> 23:50.726
You make a compelling case,
Mr. Adelman.

23:50.727 --> 23:51.665
No, Your Honor!

23:51.666 --> 23:54.198
The accused confessed
to kidnapping the girl,

23:54.199 --> 23:56.221
and led us to where
he had her imprisoned.

23:56.222 --> 23:58.890
Ms. Boyle, as heinous as I
find the accused's actions,

23:58.891 --> 24:00.397
you know the law as well as I do.

24:00.398 --> 24:03.696
Any confession illegally
coerced is inadmissible,

24:03.697 --> 24:06.559
and with no admissible evidence,
we have no basis to hold him.

24:06.560 --> 24:08.340
The State pleads for more time,
Your Honor.

24:08.341 --> 24:09.316
Your Honor...

24:09.317 --> 24:11.887
We don't want this
individual on the street.

24:11.888 --> 24:14.162
But at the same time,
an officer seems to have taken the law

24:14.163 --> 24:18.175
into his own hands,
which we cannot abide.

24:18.176 --> 24:20.974
We are looking at the weekend.

24:20.975 --> 24:22.337
I'm going to schedule
a hearing on this case

24:22.338 --> 24:24.509
for Monday afternoon.

24:24.510 --> 24:27.024
If the State cannot marshal
some admissible evidence

24:27.025 --> 24:29.469
to indict by then,
I will have no choice

24:29.470 --> 24:32.318
but to let the accused go.

24:35.520 --> 24:36.851
Hey. What happened?

24:36.852 --> 24:38.199
What happened?

24:38.200 --> 24:39.588
It's a disaster,
that's what happened.

24:39.589 --> 24:40.628
Stop with the dramatics,
and just tell me.

24:40.629 --> 24:41.700
What did you think you were doing?

24:41.701 --> 24:42.668
What do you mean,
what I was doing?

24:42.669 --> 24:43.804
I was saving a little girl's life.

24:43.805 --> 24:46.300
What, so this pervert can
go prey on some other girl?

24:46.301 --> 24:47.203
He's probably going to walk

24:47.204 --> 24:48.621
because you trashed
all the evidence.

24:48.622 --> 24:49.595
We didn't trash the evidence. Oh.

24:49.596 --> 24:51.706
We got the van in custody.
CSU's all over it

24:51.707 --> 24:52.850
for DNA and fibers.

24:52.851 --> 24:54.592
Yeah, well you better
hope they find something,

24:54.593 --> 24:55.873
or you find something.

24:55.874 --> 24:57.203
You have till Monday.

24:57.204 --> 24:58.720
What do you mean,
I only got until Monday?

24:58.721 --> 25:00.166
Monday. Because that's
when they're going

25:00.167 --> 25:02.820
to let the scumbag go.
You crossed the line, Danny.

25:02.821 --> 25:03.880
Get off my case.

25:03.881 --> 25:04.892
Oh, I'll be getting off your case.

25:04.893 --> 25:06.392
You're my brother.
I'll have to recuse myself

25:06.393 --> 25:08.726
if this goes to trial,
but that's a really big "If,"

25:08.727 --> 25:10.669
isn't it?

25:29.138 --> 25:30.908
Anybody home?

25:33.387 --> 25:34.180
Hey, Dad.

25:34.181 --> 25:35.246
Hey.

25:35.247 --> 25:37.202
I got the meat here from
Eddie's for tomorrow.

25:37.203 --> 25:38.907
Linda says you should
probably take it out

25:38.908 --> 25:41.612
about two hours
before you go to mass.

25:44.618 --> 25:46.320
I guess you heard.

25:46.321 --> 25:48.209
Not the best news.

25:48.210 --> 25:50.137
No. CSU scoured the van.

25:50.138 --> 25:52.133
No fibers, not a single hair.

25:52.134 --> 25:53.357
Guess I screwed up, huh?

25:53.358 --> 25:55.433
Internal Affairs is going
to have to get into this.

25:55.434 --> 25:58.040
Just so you know, Demarcus
had nothing to do with it.

25:58.041 --> 26:01.083
I told him to call it in.

26:01.084 --> 26:03.733
This whole thing will go down a
lot easier if you nail this guy.

26:03.734 --> 26:05.860
I know that, Dad,
but I got nothing.

26:05.861 --> 26:07.415
Guy had a ritual.

26:07.416 --> 26:09.252
Yeah, I mean, he had
the candles, the dress,

26:09.253 --> 26:10.795
the communion thing,
but that's it.

26:10.796 --> 26:11.543
Well...

26:11.544 --> 26:13.251
maybe you should run
it through VICAP,

26:13.252 --> 26:15.675
see if there's any cold
cases with the same M.O.?

26:15.676 --> 26:17.026
Just 'cause the guy
doesn't have a record

26:17.027 --> 26:20.113
doesn't mean he didn't do it.

26:20.114 --> 26:21.732
Right.

26:21.733 --> 26:23.661
'Cause you don't just
wake up one day at 50

26:23.662 --> 26:26.360
and become a pervert.

26:26.361 --> 26:28.525
That's a welcome relief.

26:29.418 --> 26:31.178
Thanks, Chief.

26:31.179 --> 26:33.953
Danny, you ever see that doctor?

26:36.367 --> 26:39.179
Well, you know,
I've been busy, Dad.

26:39.180 --> 26:43.313
There's no shame talking
about what went on in Iraq.

26:45.272 --> 26:47.963
I'll get around to it.

26:50.701 --> 26:53.881
Don't forget about the meat.

27:04.206 --> 27:06.575
Whitney, tell them
where you've been.

27:06.576 --> 27:08.598
She's-she's been in Alberta,

27:08.599 --> 27:11.923
working on a takeover of a
Canadian shale oil outfit.

27:11.924 --> 27:14.677
Jamie's the one with the
exciting new gig, though, right?

27:14.678 --> 27:18.553
Yeah, how was life on the
mean streets today, Jaimer?

27:19.523 --> 27:22.223
A guy pushed his boy
down a flight of stairs.

27:22.224 --> 27:24.383
Kid's paralyzed.

27:25.786 --> 27:27.793
There's some bad people out there.

27:27.794 --> 27:29.975
I need a cigarette.

27:32.541 --> 27:34.732
Excuse me, guys.

27:37.968 --> 27:39.545
Syd!

27:48.032 --> 27:49.470
I'm sorry.

27:49.471 --> 27:51.605
I know this isn't
easy for you, Syd.

27:51.606 --> 27:54.152
What did your mother call it,
my little bait and switch?

27:54.153 --> 27:55.482
You fall for a Harvard lawyer

27:55.483 --> 27:56.932
and you end up with
a cop on the beat.

27:56.933 --> 27:58.102
It isn't about the status

27:58.103 --> 28:00.007
or the money or any of that stuff.

28:00.008 --> 28:02.727
I was cheering my head
off for you at graduation

28:02.728 --> 28:05.577
along with everybody else. Just...

28:05.578 --> 28:09.081
Afterwards, I started thinking
about your brother Joe.

28:09.082 --> 28:10.460
The reality finally hit me

28:10.461 --> 28:13.572
that you're going to
be out there every day.

28:13.573 --> 28:16.647
It's where I want to be.

28:16.648 --> 28:19.778
Really, I always
wanted to be a cop.

28:26.013 --> 28:28.858
Hey, we're going to be okay.

28:32.616 --> 28:34.077
Okay?

28:36.394 --> 28:37.994
We better get back in.

28:37.995 --> 28:40.170
Yeah.

28:56.447 --> 28:59.626
Most of these kidnaps
are custodial.

29:02.785 --> 29:04.578
Hold on. I got something.

29:04.579 --> 29:06.295
Cold case. Tampa, Florida.

29:06.296 --> 29:09.754
Catholic girl right around
Teresa's age went missing.

29:09.755 --> 29:11.038
Body never found.

29:11.039 --> 29:12.373
When Banse was living there?

29:12.374 --> 29:14.489
What a coincidence.

29:14.490 --> 29:15.919
All right. You keep
looking for open cases.

29:15.920 --> 29:17.366
I'm going to call down to Tampa,

29:17.367 --> 29:18.783
try to get police records
and news coverage.

29:18.784 --> 29:19.969
There's got to be
something that we can find

29:19.970 --> 29:22.444
to tie the guy to this crime.

29:28.642 --> 29:31.022
How many times have we
set this table together?

29:31.023 --> 29:32.727
A million.

29:32.728 --> 29:33.973
I remember the first time

29:33.974 --> 29:36.635
we didn't set a place for Grandma.

29:36.636 --> 29:39.187
Yeah, I know. I miss her, too.

29:39.188 --> 29:41.086
I wish you had met
my Grandma Rose.

29:41.087 --> 29:42.785
She was such a riot.

29:42.786 --> 29:44.125
This is her china, you know.

29:44.126 --> 29:45.509
Where is everybody?

29:45.510 --> 29:47.189
That roast is not going to wait.

29:47.190 --> 29:48.614
Boys! Guys! Dinner!

29:48.615 --> 29:50.846
I better get those rolls
before they're incinerated.

29:50.847 --> 29:52.813
Sit next to me at
this end of the table.

29:52.814 --> 29:53.879
Okay.

29:53.880 --> 29:55.593
Hey, I'm good to go.

29:55.594 --> 29:57.189
Something smells awfully good,

29:57.190 --> 29:58.529
and it ain't this pip-squeak.

29:58.530 --> 29:59.420
Hey!

29:59.421 --> 30:01.358
Grandpa, can I sit
next to you, please?

30:01.359 --> 30:02.053
Sure, squirt.

30:02.054 --> 30:04.910
Staten Island isn't the
other side of the world.

30:04.911 --> 30:09.019
It wouldn't kill you to come
to our house one Sunday.

30:09.020 --> 30:10.321
Hey, all!

30:10.322 --> 30:11.731
Hey, Jamie. Hey.

30:11.732 --> 30:12.857
Here he is.

30:12.858 --> 30:14.914
Finally.

30:14.915 --> 30:16.081
Where's your girl?

30:16.082 --> 30:17.676
Greenwich with her folks.

30:17.677 --> 30:18.634
More for us then.

30:18.635 --> 30:19.859
Hey, where's Danny?

30:19.860 --> 30:21.913
He said he would try to make it.

30:21.914 --> 30:23.253
You all know, right?

30:23.254 --> 30:24.373
I'd like to strangle him.

30:24.374 --> 30:26.917
No strangling on Sunday,
okay, sunshine?

30:26.918 --> 30:27.931
Okay, Pops.

30:27.932 --> 30:29.462
Danny did what he had to do.

30:29.463 --> 30:30.887
Well, I knew you
would take his side.

30:30.888 --> 30:32.179
I say what I think.

30:32.180 --> 30:34.447
Yeah, and look where it got you.

30:38.718 --> 30:40.803
Jamie?

30:42.626 --> 30:43.409
Bless us, O Lord,

30:43.410 --> 30:45.020
for these gifts which
we are about to receive

30:45.021 --> 30:47.484
from your bountiful hands
through Christ our Lord. Amen.

30:47.485 --> 30:49.230
Amen.

30:50.317 --> 30:51.544
Real food.

30:51.545 --> 30:52.783
I don't want any beans.

30:52.784 --> 30:53.549
Yes, you do.

30:53.550 --> 30:54.978
I'll tell you where it got me.

30:54.979 --> 30:56.700
I got a clean conscience,

30:56.701 --> 30:58.217
and I can sleep at night.

30:58.218 --> 30:59.142
Where what got you?

30:59.143 --> 31:01.290
Mom's mad at him because
he took your side.

31:01.291 --> 31:02.813
Okay, Nicky.
Stay out of it, please.

31:02.814 --> 31:04.919
Oh, your mom's riding around
on her high horse, huh?

31:04.920 --> 31:06.501
Don't make this about me.
I'm not the one

31:06.502 --> 31:08.567
that slapped some guy around and
stuck his head in the toilet.

31:08.568 --> 31:09.426
What do you know about it?

31:09.427 --> 31:11.159
Dad stuck somebody's
head in the toilet? Shh.

31:11.160 --> 31:12.780
I know you're supposed
to be enforcing the law,

31:12.781 --> 31:15.232
not making it up as you go along.

31:15.233 --> 31:16.945
You have no idea what goes on.

31:16.946 --> 31:18.450
You only know what
you think you know.

31:18.451 --> 31:19.781
The laws are there for a reason.

31:19.782 --> 31:21.568
Yeah, to protect the criminals.

31:21.569 --> 31:24.959
No, to protect society
from a police state.

31:24.960 --> 31:26.443
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

31:26.444 --> 31:27.688
Such a jerk.

31:27.689 --> 31:28.707
Hey, screw you, Erin!

31:28.708 --> 31:30.229
No, screw you. Screw you!

31:30.230 --> 31:32.818
You don't know what I had to...
This is Sunday dinner.

31:34.273 --> 31:37.322
Not a free-for-all.

31:37.323 --> 31:39.562
Let's keep it civil.

31:54.583 --> 31:57.206
Dad, if you're allowed
to use force and torture,

31:57.207 --> 31:59.684
then you corrupt the moral
fiber of the culture.

31:59.685 --> 32:01.714
Nobody's in favor of torture.

32:01.715 --> 32:02.817
The issue is the use

32:02.818 --> 32:05.525
of enhanced interrogation,
is it ever justified?

32:05.526 --> 32:07.753
I say no, and so does
John McCain, by the way.

32:07.754 --> 32:09.721
Okay then, you've
got a ticking bomb.

32:09.722 --> 32:11.871
That guy over there planted it.
Lives are at stake.

32:11.872 --> 32:14.358
Are his rights more important
than innocent victims'?

32:14.359 --> 32:17.375
Of course not. See?

32:18.566 --> 32:19.470
Jamie, what do you think?

32:19.471 --> 32:21.570
You got a law degree.

32:21.571 --> 32:22.506
And a gun now, too.

32:22.507 --> 32:24.260
And it's a lot of power.

32:24.261 --> 32:25.557
You don't govern it, Erin's right.

32:25.558 --> 32:27.121
It's a slippery slope.

32:27.122 --> 32:28.551
You just wait, little brother.

32:28.552 --> 32:30.740
You wait until one night you
chase some guy down a dark alley

32:30.741 --> 32:32.809
and that little
object in his hand?

32:32.810 --> 32:35.826
Maybe it's a cell phone.
Maybe it's not.

32:37.799 --> 32:40.112
It's true. I can say
whatever I want,

32:40.113 --> 32:43.495
but I don't know what I would
have done in his position.

32:43.496 --> 32:45.079
I got to go, Dad.

32:45.080 --> 32:47.464
Something up? The evidence
from Tampa came in.

32:47.465 --> 32:48.055
Do you want a sandwich

32:48.056 --> 32:49.638
or something? You barely
touched your food.

32:49.639 --> 32:51.186
No, babe. Thanks.
I'll see you boys later.

32:51.187 --> 32:52.530
Bye. Bye.

32:52.531 --> 32:54.404
Oh, let me ask you
one question, Erin.

32:54.405 --> 32:57.268
What if it would've been Nicky,
she only had 24 hours left...

32:57.269 --> 32:58.795
what would you want me to do then?

32:58.796 --> 32:59.936
Me? That's not fair.

32:59.937 --> 33:02.045
Be honest. Some guy
snatches her off the street,

33:02.046 --> 33:02.984
I got a hold of him,

33:02.985 --> 33:04.536
and he won't talk?

33:04.537 --> 33:06.390
Give me a break.

33:06.391 --> 33:07.709
Nicky? You don't have to worry.

33:07.710 --> 33:09.087
They'd throw her
back in ten minutes.

33:09.088 --> 33:11.417
That's not funny.

33:13.235 --> 33:14.185
Thanks, Grandpa.

33:14.186 --> 33:15.734
I'm gonna go watch TV.

33:15.735 --> 33:18.012
Nicky, you were not excused.

33:18.013 --> 33:19.782
Nicky.

33:19.783 --> 33:21.018
Nicky...

33:21.019 --> 33:22.403
you know better.

33:22.404 --> 33:24.021
Come on, please?

33:24.022 --> 33:27.241
Sean, you need to get back here.

33:27.242 --> 33:30.712
Can we eat dessert
in front of the TV?

33:30.713 --> 33:33.295
I got a nice end piece here.

33:33.999 --> 33:35.715
Give it to me.

33:37.081 --> 33:38.752
FRANK: One for the sauce,

33:38.753 --> 33:40.619
one for me after that fracas.

33:40.620 --> 33:41.643
Jamie?

33:41.644 --> 33:43.240
Don't mind if I do.

33:43.241 --> 33:44.374
That kid.

33:44.375 --> 33:46.673
I'll tell Pop to put a
governor on the motor.

33:46.674 --> 33:48.690
Teenage girls are
sensitive creatures,

33:48.691 --> 33:49.999
if I remember correctly.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.210
I've got 25 cases

33:51.211 --> 33:52.233
on my desk,

33:52.234 --> 33:54.332
divorce papers that
my ex won't sign,

33:54.333 --> 33:57.193
and a brother who thinks
I'm Miss Goody Two-shoes?

33:57.194 --> 34:00.147
I mean, doesn't he know that I
would shoot this guy myself?

34:00.148 --> 34:01.770
Tough week, huh?

34:01.771 --> 34:03.904
Yeah.

34:05.164 --> 34:07.878
Sometimes I wish I could just
go upstairs to my old room

34:07.879 --> 34:10.675
and crawl under the
covers like I never left.

34:10.676 --> 34:13.202
The natives are getting
restless out there.

34:13.203 --> 34:16.469
Are you guys drinking
or making dessert?

34:16.469 --> 34:18.469
Whew. Drinking.

34:20.027 --> 34:22.387
I'd better go help.

34:24.549 --> 34:27.982
Your fellow grad with
the sharpshooter medal,

34:27.983 --> 34:29.268
she's a babe.

34:29.270 --> 34:31.250
Who, Maria? Romano?

34:31.251 --> 34:35.792
Good friend? Friend.

34:35.793 --> 34:37.745
How about you, Dad?

34:37.746 --> 34:40.755
You got any good
friends in your life?

34:40.755 --> 34:43.697
Not a day goes by without...

34:43.699 --> 34:47.455
me thinking about your mom
and what she's missing.

34:47.456 --> 34:50.373
Seeing the kids grow up and...

34:50.375 --> 34:53.321
grandkids and...

35:02.932 --> 35:05.034
The ship is in, huh?

35:05.035 --> 35:07.131
Yeah. This is
everything from Tampa.

35:07.132 --> 35:09.963
Files, tapes, field interviews,
photos. Yeah,

35:09.964 --> 35:12.340
all that technology,
and what does it come down to?

35:12.341 --> 35:15.252
Couple of cops and
some beat-up old boxes.

35:23.990 --> 35:25.963
Jameson Reagan?

35:25.964 --> 35:27.387
What's going on?

35:27.388 --> 35:28.906
I'm Special Agent Cisco.

35:28.907 --> 35:29.982
This is Agent Anderson.

35:29.983 --> 35:31.613
We'd like to talk
to you for a minute.

35:33.415 --> 35:35.125
About what?

35:35.126 --> 35:37.760
You ever see one of these before?

35:39.044 --> 35:40.018
What is that?

35:40.019 --> 35:41.927
It's what they give a
cop when he's initiated

35:41.928 --> 35:45.089
into a group called
the Blue Templar.

35:45.090 --> 35:48.078
The Blue Templar?

35:48.079 --> 35:49.332
I thought that was a fairy tale.

35:49.333 --> 35:50.988
My grandfather used
to tell me stories

35:50.989 --> 35:53.684
about that when I was a kid.

35:53.685 --> 35:56.355
A secret society inside the
New York Police Department.

35:56.356 --> 35:57.529
They were real.

35:57.530 --> 35:59.933
They took care of their own
and they cleaned up Dodge.

35:59.934 --> 36:02.006
But now we've connected
them with extortion,

36:02.007 --> 36:05.434
stealing drug evidence,
cash, murder for hire.

36:05.435 --> 36:08.630
My father know about this?

36:08.631 --> 36:11.186
You're investigating
the department

36:11.187 --> 36:12.389
and you haven't told my father?

36:12.390 --> 36:13.155
We don't know

36:13.156 --> 36:15.412
how wide this spreads
or how high it goes.

36:15.413 --> 36:17.408
That's why we need
somebody on the inside.

36:17.409 --> 36:19.597
I'm out of here. Wait a minute.

36:19.598 --> 36:21.873
There's something you should hear.

36:23.090 --> 36:23.993
MAN : It's me.

36:23.994 --> 36:25.424
I think I'm in.

36:25.425 --> 36:26.162
I'll let you know

36:26.163 --> 36:29.245
when I get a location
so I can wire up.

36:31.682 --> 36:32.709
It's me.

36:32.710 --> 36:34.886
I think I'm in. I'll let you know

36:34.887 --> 36:38.087
when I get a location
so I can wire up.

36:39.225 --> 36:40.629
That's my brother, Joe.

36:40.630 --> 36:42.527
This was his last message to us,

36:42.528 --> 36:45.795
the day before he was killed.

36:45.796 --> 36:47.511
He was working with you?

36:47.512 --> 36:48.635
Your brother wasn't killed

36:48.636 --> 36:50.353
in a bust gone bad.

36:50.354 --> 36:53.027
They made him,
then they killed him.

36:53.028 --> 36:54.483
We thought you might
want to come work for us

36:54.484 --> 36:56.889
and finish what he started.

37:12.872 --> 37:14.945
Hey. Manieri.

37:14.946 --> 37:16.291
Come on, wake up.

37:16.292 --> 37:17.585
Come on!

37:17.586 --> 37:20.028
We've got three hours left
before this creep Banse walks.

37:20.029 --> 37:21.380
All right, all right.

37:21.381 --> 37:23.592
Anybody find anything yet?

37:23.593 --> 37:26.153
DEMARCUS : Yeah,
I'm seeing double, Reagan.

37:26.154 --> 37:28.045
Yeah, me, too.

37:28.046 --> 37:30.033
Hey, look who's here.

37:30.034 --> 37:31.007
There he is!

37:31.008 --> 37:32.653
Hey!

37:32.654 --> 37:34.099
How you doing?

37:34.100 --> 37:35.451
We brought you a cake.

37:35.452 --> 37:36.958
You brought me a cake?
Did you bake this

37:36.959 --> 37:39.235
all by yourself? You did, huh?

37:39.236 --> 37:42.044
Thank you. We are so
grateful you saved our baby.

37:42.045 --> 37:44.776
Just glad she's home safe with her
family now. Thank you so much.

37:44.777 --> 37:47.677
Would you like to have a tour
of this big police station?

37:47.678 --> 37:50.269
Yeah? Officer,
would you take them around?

37:50.270 --> 37:53.608
I'll see you soon, okay?

37:53.609 --> 37:56.138
Tell me that doesn't
make it all worth it.

37:56.139 --> 37:57.245
Except now I'm gonna be the guy

37:57.246 --> 37:59.914
that puts that creep
Banse back on the street.

37:59.915 --> 38:01.846
Some other little girl's gonna
end up like our cold case

38:01.847 --> 38:04.286
here in Florida.

38:10.428 --> 38:11.415
Demarcus.

38:11.416 --> 38:12.638
Yeah?

38:12.639 --> 38:13.713
Come look at this.

38:13.714 --> 38:14.547
What?

38:14.548 --> 38:17.178
This picture. The girl in Florida.

38:17.179 --> 38:18.506
Look at that.

38:18.507 --> 38:22.210
The cross. The necklace.

38:22.211 --> 38:23.671
Let's take a ride.

38:23.672 --> 38:25.352
I can't believe this is happening.

38:25.353 --> 38:27.714
My husband isn't a monster.
Well, we don't even

38:27.715 --> 38:29.555
know yet how many other
children he might've took.

38:29.556 --> 38:30.977
Mrs. Banse, I'm afraid
we're gonna have to take

38:30.978 --> 38:32.339
a closer look at the necklace.

38:32.340 --> 38:34.304
The girl's parents
said her name, Kathy,

38:34.305 --> 38:36.692
was engraved on the back.

38:36.693 --> 38:38.760
My husband said that's
because it's an antique.

38:38.761 --> 38:40.444
We need the cross
for evidence, ma'am.

38:40.445 --> 38:42.199
Could you remove it, please?

38:43.660 --> 38:45.774
Mrs. Banse, please.

38:51.932 --> 38:54.512
Jay Castleman in the Attorney
General's Office, please?

38:54.513 --> 38:57.384
Hi, Jay. It's Erin Boyle,
Manhattan D.A.'s Office.

38:57.385 --> 38:59.117
We want your office to
initiate proceedings

38:59.118 --> 39:01.494
to extradite Donald Banse
to Florida for murder

39:01.495 --> 39:03.508
with special circumstance.

39:03.509 --> 39:05.945
We have the cross that
Kathy MacDonald was wearing

39:05.946 --> 39:07.825
when she disappeared in 2005.

39:07.826 --> 39:10.320
Banse gave it to his
wife around that time.

39:10.321 --> 39:12.392
Tampa police have located
what are believed to be

39:12.393 --> 39:14.359
the girl's remains in
a storage container

39:14.360 --> 39:17.755
in Orlando registered
in Banse's alias.

39:17.756 --> 39:20.271
Appreciate it. Thank you.

39:21.349 --> 39:22.353
Yeah?

39:22.354 --> 39:23.503
Yeah.

39:23.504 --> 39:25.699
Beautiful!

39:25.700 --> 39:27.111
They're not shy about exercising

39:27.112 --> 39:28.691
capital punishment
down in Florida.

39:28.692 --> 39:32.150
Yeah. It's a happy outcome,
this time.

39:33.642 --> 39:35.189
Just give me this one, will you?

39:35.190 --> 39:37.796
You don't get it, do you?

39:37.797 --> 39:40.037
Say hello to the ACLU for me.

39:40.038 --> 39:43.489
You're the one that's gonna
need a lawyer, Danny.

39:43.490 --> 39:45.681
You want to talk about that?

39:46.933 --> 39:48.039
Probably.

39:48.040 --> 39:49.934
Probably.

39:49.935 --> 39:52.113
Thanks, sis.

39:54.522 --> 39:56.352
See ya.

40:01.575 --> 40:05.402
Start spreading the news

40:05.403 --> 40:08.674
I'm leaving today

40:08.675 --> 40:13.982
I want to be a part of it.

40:13.983 --> 40:19.180
New York, New York.

40:21.344 --> 40:23.393
That's okay; coffee's still hot.

40:23.394 --> 40:24.935
Any luck?

40:24.936 --> 40:28.824
No, the damn fish must
be changing shifts.

40:31.771 --> 40:33.268
Beautiful spot, isn't it?

40:33.269 --> 40:34.906
Caught a lot of fish here.

40:34.907 --> 40:37.497
Just not today. Just not tod...

40:38.976 --> 40:40.540
Jamie, you know when you asked me

40:40.541 --> 40:42.928
if I was seeing anybody?

40:42.929 --> 40:46.330
I was not forthcoming.

40:46.331 --> 40:49.295
Because I am.

40:49.296 --> 40:51.797
That's great.

40:51.798 --> 40:53.525
Good.

40:53.526 --> 40:57.457
I hate keeping secrets.

40:59.143 --> 41:00.910
Yeah.

41:07.648 --> 41:10.495
So, Jamie, what's going on?

41:10.496 --> 41:11.444
What do you mean?

41:11.445 --> 41:14.660
Come on, I'm your father.

41:17.997 --> 41:21.619
You having second thoughts
about wearing the uniform?

41:21.620 --> 41:23.613
No.

41:23.614 --> 41:25.988
No.

41:25.989 --> 41:29.054
Just everything's new.

41:29.055 --> 41:31.052
That T.O. of mine's
a piece of work.

41:31.053 --> 41:34.242
Renzulli.

41:34.243 --> 41:38.819
What, are you keeping tabs on me?

41:39.620 --> 41:43.279
I got a vested interest.
