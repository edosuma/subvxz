00:50.449 --> 00:54.442
<i>The world above
is a wonderful place.</i>

00:57.122 --> 01:00.649
<i>But everyone knows</i>

01:00.759 --> 01:03.751
<i>the true magic lies...</i>

01:03.795 --> 01:05.660
<i>under the sea,</i>

01:05.731 --> 01:09.394
<i>where the water is clear,
the fish swim free,</i>

01:09.468 --> 01:14.929
<i>and the mer-people live
in the beautiful kingdom of Atlantica.</i>

01:26.885 --> 01:30.321
<i>King Triton ruled the seas
with a fair hand...</i>

01:30.389 --> 01:33.256
- Yoo-hoo!
- You're very kind.

01:33.325 --> 01:36.556
<i>And an open heart.</i>

01:36.628 --> 01:38.425
Ariel! Oh!

01:51.677 --> 01:54.976
<i>Oh, mon.</i>

01:58.116 --> 02:02.644
<i>No one loved music more than
Triton's beloved queen, Athena.</i>

02:02.721 --> 02:05.519
<i>She and their seven
darling princesses</i>

02:05.590 --> 02:09.616
<i>filled his life with joy and song.</i>

02:09.695 --> 02:12.789
<i><font color=yellow> Oh, the waves roll low</i>

02:12.864 --> 02:15.458
<i><font color=yellow> And the waves roll high</i>

02:15.534 --> 02:18.128
<i><font color=yellow>-  And so it goes</font>
- Oh!</i>

02:18.203 --> 02:22.731
<i><font color=yellow> Under a bright blue</i>

02:22.808 --> 02:25.743
<i><font color=yellow> Endless sky</i>

02:25.811 --> 02:28.746
<i><font color=yellow> Waves try to measure</i>

02:28.814 --> 02:32.011
<i><font color=yellow> The days that we treasure</i>

02:33.018 --> 02:34.747
<i><font color=yellow> Wave hello</i>

02:39.424 --> 02:41.153
Good night, girls.

02:45.030 --> 02:48.466
<i>Ah, yes,
the king loved his queen,</i>

02:48.533 --> 02:51.730
<i>and he took every opportunity
to show her.</i>

03:03.382 --> 03:05.646
<i>Endless sky</i>

03:05.717 --> 03:08.584
Our song.

03:08.653 --> 03:10.120
Our song.

03:15.227 --> 03:19.220
<i>Oh, mon!
It was a magical time!</i>

03:19.297 --> 03:24.030
<i>The pure joy of song
filled life in Atlantica.</i>

03:44.322 --> 03:46.313
Shh.

04:00.105 --> 04:05.771
<i>But even the brightest days
can be darkened by an unseen tempest.</i>

04:17.889 --> 04:18.889
Go!

04:34.973 --> 04:40.036
<i>Somewhere in the chaos,
Queen Athena was lost to us.</i>

04:40.979 --> 04:42.105
Athena!

04:49.488 --> 04:51.479
No!

05:01.066 --> 05:03.261
<i>Each note of that lovely melody</i>

05:03.335 --> 05:05.667
<i>seemed to deepen the king's anguish.</i>

05:06.438 --> 05:08.599
<i>He couldn't bear to hear it.</i>

05:17.215 --> 05:19.683
<i>From that moment on,</i>

05:19.751 --> 05:22.686
<i>the king's heart stayed dark.</i>

05:24.956 --> 05:28.824
<i>And music was banned from Atlantica...</i>

05:31.563 --> 05:32.894
<i>forever.</i>

05:46.244 --> 05:49.839
<i>Ten years later,
Atlantica looked the same.</i>

06:04.996 --> 06:09.330
<i>But I can't say that about...
everything.</i>

06:17.943 --> 06:21.379
- Uppy-uppy, my darlings.
- It's us.

06:22.514 --> 06:24.277
Governess!

06:27.285 --> 06:29.116
- Hey!
- Rise and shine.

06:29.187 --> 06:31.712
- Why so early?
- Mustn't be late.

06:31.790 --> 06:33.417
But it's still dark out.

06:33.491 --> 06:34.491
Uh...

06:35.227 --> 06:37.627
- Oh. Hi.
- Wakey-wakey.

06:37.696 --> 06:42.030
- Oh, I was dreaming about a boy.
- Yes. Come on, girls.

06:42.100 --> 06:44.796
- But I need my beauty sleep.
- Tell me about it.

06:44.869 --> 06:47.167
Easy for you.
No one cares what you look...

06:47.239 --> 06:49.173
- Move it.
- I think you're lovely.

06:49.241 --> 06:50.731
Can't we meet Father later?

06:50.809 --> 06:53.642
I don't get to make
those kinds of decisions.

06:53.712 --> 06:56.010
Any decisions, really.

06:59.084 --> 07:00.949
Get up!

07:00.986 --> 07:04.319
- OK, we heard you.
- We're going as fast as we can.

07:04.389 --> 07:07.187
All right, all right, all right.
Move your tails.

07:07.259 --> 07:09.523
This is our special time
with your father.

07:09.594 --> 07:12.757
Special?
It's the same every morning.

07:12.831 --> 07:15.891
- She's got a point.
- That's what your father cares about.

07:15.967 --> 07:18.800
Predictability,
presentation, punctuality.

07:18.870 --> 07:21.566
- That's all Dad cares about.
- She's got a point.

07:21.640 --> 07:23.437
- You've got your own mirror!
- Two minutes.

07:23.508 --> 07:26.033
Stop primping!

07:26.111 --> 07:29.512
- Anyway, I told her, she used to...
- Come on, Ariel.

07:29.581 --> 07:33.381
Why can't he let us do
something different? Just once.

07:33.451 --> 07:35.976
Give him a break.
He's the king, remember?

07:36.054 --> 07:39.990
- You try running a kingdom.
- I wouldn't run it like this.

07:40.058 --> 07:41.457
Don't upset him, Ariel.

07:41.526 --> 07:43.960
Just because you're the oldest, Attina,

07:44.029 --> 07:46.998
- doesn't mean you can boss us around.
- Yes, it does.

07:47.065 --> 07:49.795
Benjamin, if we're late again,
I'll never get a promotion.

07:49.868 --> 07:51.733
- Marina...
- Come on, girls.

07:51.803 --> 07:54.397
Not that I want a promotion.
No, no, no, I love this job.

07:54.472 --> 07:58.272
Looking after you is what I live for.

07:58.376 --> 07:59.707
Really.

08:00.612 --> 08:04.810
- I hate this job!
- The less said the better.

08:10.388 --> 08:14.085
Whoa! Whoa!

08:15.960 --> 08:19.623
- Good morning, Your Highness.
- Sebastian.

08:19.698 --> 08:21.962
- Oh!
- Anything to report?

08:22.033 --> 08:25.992
Unfortunately,
the sprat and the... smelt

08:26.071 --> 08:28.562
were still... squabbling.

08:28.640 --> 08:32.440
No worries. I told them
I'd sic the salmon on them.

08:32.510 --> 08:35.172
Sebastian,
what would I do without you?

08:35.246 --> 08:38.703
You'd be negotiatin' with the sprat
and the smelt, that's what.

08:45.190 --> 08:46.418
Shh!

08:48.393 --> 08:51.191
- Good morning, girls.
- Good morning, Father.

08:51.262 --> 08:54.789
- Marina.
- Good morning, Your Majesty.

08:56.868 --> 08:58.961
- Sebastian.
- You're late.

09:00.338 --> 09:02.397
I... uh...

09:03.341 --> 09:07.072
Your Majesty.

09:07.145 --> 09:09.875
Well, I presume
you've all been attending

09:09.948 --> 09:12.439
- to your royal duties this week.
- Yes, Father.

09:12.517 --> 09:15.509
- We've been working diligently.
- We're always done early.

09:15.587 --> 09:17.111
- Shh!
- And the coral is in bloom.

09:17.188 --> 09:19.156
- Clam it!
- Enough!

09:19.224 --> 09:22.421
So I thought maybe we could
go for a swim on the reef?

09:23.294 --> 09:27.697
- Not today, Ariel.
- But it only happens once a year.

09:27.766 --> 09:32.726
- It could be fun.
- I don't have the time.

09:32.804 --> 09:35.466
I was thinking we could just
skip the morning walk.

09:35.540 --> 09:37.667
Ariel! Your father said no.

09:39.444 --> 09:40.775
Yes, sir.

09:45.049 --> 09:46.676
Nice job.

09:48.386 --> 09:50.650
Be on time tomorrow.

09:52.490 --> 09:54.981
- Let's move it!
- OK, we're coming.

09:55.059 --> 09:56.924
- Time to go.
- Great.

10:04.903 --> 10:06.495
Here they come!

10:22.086 --> 10:24.953
Well, hi to you, too. Oh, get...

10:28.359 --> 10:31.624
That's it!

10:32.764 --> 10:34.026
Ooh!

10:36.334 --> 10:37.858
Aah!

10:38.503 --> 10:42.496
Your Majesty, I was thinking about
making some changes in the palace staff.

10:42.574 --> 10:43.905
- Huh?
- Really?

10:45.510 --> 10:46.704
Got it!

10:50.181 --> 10:51.409
- Watch it!
- Careful!

10:53.451 --> 10:54.941
Get up!

10:57.055 --> 10:58.249
Cuckoo!

11:01.659 --> 11:04.924
That will be all, Sebastian, Marina.

11:04.996 --> 11:08.329
- Good day, girls.
- Goodbye, Father.

11:08.399 --> 11:10.196
- Thank goodness that's over.
- Ariel.

11:11.469 --> 11:13.300
Oh! Yes, Daddy?

11:13.371 --> 11:16.431
- He sounds grumpier than yesterday.
- Time to go.

11:16.508 --> 11:20.239
A princess does not tickle
another princess with seaweed.

11:20.311 --> 11:21.471
You saw that?

11:23.014 --> 11:25.608
I was just trying to have some fun.

11:25.683 --> 11:29.084
- You disrupted your sisters.
- Well, they laughed.

11:29.153 --> 11:31.417
- Well, I didn't.
- Daddy, why can't...

11:31.489 --> 11:34.720
Is it too much to ask that you
simply walk with your family?

11:34.792 --> 11:37.022
- That's all we ever do.
- Ariel...

11:37.095 --> 11:39.461
- Can't we do something different?
- Enough!

11:40.899 --> 11:44.767
You have to learn to respect
the way I run this kingdom.

11:46.838 --> 11:48.237
Barnacles.

11:48.306 --> 11:51.207
What? That'll take all day.

11:51.276 --> 11:53.904
Well, then you'd better get started,
young lady.

11:56.514 --> 11:58.505
I hate this place.

12:05.557 --> 12:06.888
Mm-hmm.

12:08.459 --> 12:09.619
Snacky-snack.

12:12.730 --> 12:15.290
OK.

12:15.800 --> 12:18.598
- No manners.
- This job is killing me!

12:18.670 --> 12:19.830
Oh, dear.

12:19.904 --> 12:23.169
If I have to watch over these
spoiled princesses one more day,

12:23.241 --> 12:25.141
- I'm gonna beach myself!
- Mm-hmm.

12:25.209 --> 12:29.942
You should've heard that little
clawboy Sebastian today. "You're late."

12:30.014 --> 12:32.539
If Triton wasn't looking,

12:32.617 --> 12:36.314
I would have squashed
that crustacean into a crab cake!

12:36.387 --> 12:38.150
Mm-hmm.

12:38.222 --> 12:41.089
- Maybe I'm just too sensitive?
- Dip.

12:45.697 --> 12:49.497
- Did you feed them today?
- Yes. Twice.

12:49.567 --> 12:50.761
And the key?

12:56.574 --> 12:58.974
Ooh! That Sebastian!

12:59.077 --> 13:03.377
- I despise him! I loathe him!
- Never heard that one.

13:03.414 --> 13:06.474
How did that little invertebrate
get to be chief of staff?

13:06.551 --> 13:09.315
- Chutzpah?
- I want that job.

13:09.387 --> 13:11.321
I deserve that job!

13:11.389 --> 13:14.984
So what if I'm late every once in
a while and the girls are miserable?

13:15.059 --> 13:17.928
- Nobody's perfect.
- That's right. Nobody's... perfect.

13:17.929 --> 13:18.918
- Nobody's perfect.
- That's right. Nobody's... perfect.

13:18.997 --> 13:22.194
- Oh... my.
- Everyone makes mistakes,

13:22.266 --> 13:25.258
even... him!

13:25.737 --> 13:29.696
<i><font color=yellow> Benjamin
I need to find a clue</i>

13:29.774 --> 13:31.639
Or a good cuticle cream.

13:31.709 --> 13:34.872
<i><font color=yellow> To get myself Sebastian's job</i>

13:34.946 --> 13:38.279
<i><font color=yellow> To stage a little coup

<i><font color=yellow> A quiver or a quake

13:45.623 --> 13:47.420
<i><font color=yellow> Just one mistake</i>

13:47.492 --> 13:50.484
Now, color? Sardine Silver?

13:51.162 --> 13:53.221
- No, thanks.
- Orange roughy?

13:53.297 --> 13:55.356
- Not in the mood.
- Rainbow trout?

13:55.433 --> 13:59.130
Just paint them the shade
of clarified butter!

13:59.837 --> 14:04.206
<i><font color=yellow> Sebastian
Oh, better be on his guard</i>

14:04.275 --> 14:05.503
So much for my samples.

14:05.576 --> 14:08.306
<i><font color=yellow> 'Cause I have some electric chums</i>

14:08.379 --> 14:10.176

<i><font color=yellow> Just one mistake</i>

14:22.927 --> 14:24.952

14:25.029 --> 14:26.929

15:15.947 --> 15:18.279
Sebastian's bound
to make a mistake, right?

15:18.349 --> 15:19.611
Not likely.

15:20.718 --> 15:22.515
Dream killer!

15:26.657 --> 15:29.182
One.

15:44.408 --> 15:47.571
Live from The Catfish Club, it's...

15:47.645 --> 15:50.808
Flounder!

15:50.882 --> 15:53.544
We love you, Flounder.

15:57.288 --> 15:58.880
Oh, boy.

16:03.761 --> 16:07.492
Whoo! Oh, yeah!

16:07.565 --> 16:10.227
I'm hot. I know it.

16:10.301 --> 16:11.301
- Hey!
- Aah!

16:11.369 --> 16:13.803
Was that... what I think it was?

16:13.871 --> 16:15.702
Nope. Whoops.

16:15.773 --> 16:16.773
- That!
- What?

16:16.841 --> 16:19.708
- That sound!
- Oh, that sound.

16:19.777 --> 16:21.642
I was just...

16:21.712 --> 16:23.646
cleaning out these...

16:23.714 --> 16:26.774
- But then you... Hey!
- And then I...

16:26.851 --> 16:30.412
And then the thing amajiggers just
boppity boop, bop, bap!

16:31.289 --> 16:33.257
Can you do it again?

16:33.324 --> 16:35.849
Halt! You're in violation
of the Triton Acts!

16:35.927 --> 16:39.863
- All music is forbidden in the kingdom!
- Not good.

16:39.931 --> 16:41.990
- Swim!
- Hey, get back here!

16:43.434 --> 16:44.765
Faster!

16:50.341 --> 16:51.865
Corkscrew!

16:55.746 --> 16:57.737
Ooh!

17:01.185 --> 17:03.050
Torpedo tube!

17:04.288 --> 17:05.585
Whoo-hoo!

17:11.194 --> 17:14.756
Not again!

17:16.267 --> 17:17.700
There they are!

17:18.703 --> 17:21.968
Fish launch!

17:22.039 --> 17:23.700
- Thanks.
- No problem.

17:24.876 --> 17:26.969
This way!

17:28.112 --> 17:31.707
- My name is Flounder.
- Oh, I'm Ariel.

17:33.017 --> 17:34.382
Oh, no!

17:38.456 --> 17:42.290
Princess Ariel!
What is the meaning of this?!

17:43.127 --> 17:45.322
- Princess?
- Um...

17:45.396 --> 17:47.830
- We weren't doing anything.
- No?

17:47.899 --> 17:51.062
Then why were you trying to get away?

17:52.603 --> 17:55.731
Um... 'Cause they were chasing us?

17:55.806 --> 17:58.070
We heard music, chief.

17:58.175 --> 18:00.507
Music!
The princess was making music?

18:00.544 --> 18:04.207
The princess wasn't making music.
He was.

18:05.349 --> 18:08.250
Music is against the law!
Take him to the dungeon!

18:08.319 --> 18:10.344
- I can't make it in the slammer!
- Now!

18:10.421 --> 18:14.881
Wait! This is all
a big misunderstanding. Huge.

18:14.959 --> 18:16.824
You are gonna laugh when I explain.

18:17.962 --> 18:21.659
- Which I'm about to do.
- In this century, please.

18:21.732 --> 18:26.135
Right. You see, I was just
cleaning the coral tubes,

18:26.203 --> 18:29.730
and my friend here
was helping me.

18:31.008 --> 18:33.306
That's right. Best friend helpin' out.

18:33.377 --> 18:37.370
- Makin' it happen.
- But not making music.

18:37.448 --> 18:38.574
See?

18:39.850 --> 18:42.410
Guards! Escort the princess
back to the palace.

18:42.486 --> 18:44.044
- But Sebastian...
- And you!

18:45.456 --> 18:47.788
Consider this your first
and only warning, mon.

18:49.060 --> 18:52.120
Humph!

18:56.867 --> 18:57.867
Oh!

18:59.337 --> 19:03.933
Intolerable, I tell you.
That girl is working on my last claw!

19:04.742 --> 19:07.006
If I change my hair,
he'd notice?

19:07.078 --> 19:09.273
Where's my brush?
My brush works better.

19:09.347 --> 19:14.478
OK, bedtime. Outta my way. Don't look
now, but dinner exploded on your face.

19:14.552 --> 19:17.043
- It's plankton extract and sea salt.
- Pretty.

19:17.121 --> 19:20.022
It rejuvenates the skin
and it won't clog your pores.

19:20.091 --> 19:22.423
- Whatever!
- It's your face.

19:22.493 --> 19:24.893
'Scuse me.

19:24.962 --> 19:27.522
- Uh, is that my mask?
- Nope.

19:27.598 --> 19:28.929
It's got my initial on it.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.527
All of our names
start with "A," Aquata.

19:32.603 --> 19:34.730
- My brush?
- I was gonna talk to you...

19:34.805 --> 19:37.296
- My lucky seashells?
- They're not very lucky.

19:37.375 --> 19:40.208
- Mr. Fuzzyfinkle!
- He's so cute. He likes me.

19:40.277 --> 19:43.838
- And my pillow?
- Yeah, that's for Mr. Fuzzyfinkle.

19:43.914 --> 19:45.313
- Nice try.
- Give it back!

19:45.383 --> 19:47.908
Arista, you always do this!
It's my stuff!

19:47.985 --> 19:51.853
- Finally, some entertainment.
- You're just the selfishest person...

19:51.922 --> 19:53.651
Shh! Shh! He's coming!

19:57.328 --> 20:00.456
- Good evening, girls.
- Father.

20:00.531 --> 20:03.227
- Sleep well.
- Good night, Father.

20:06.604 --> 20:07.662
Ariel?

20:11.342 --> 20:13.003
Good night.

20:17.681 --> 20:21.674
Good night.

20:25.956 --> 20:28.083
Why did you do that?

20:29.160 --> 20:31.424
He's our father.

20:39.170 --> 20:42.162
Sit there as long as you want, Ariel.

20:42.239 --> 20:44.503
Nothing's going to change.

20:48.012 --> 20:52.312
Maybe I could have her pillow.
Oh! Ha, ha, very funny.

21:09.834 --> 21:11.165
What?

21:22.279 --> 21:24.406
How long has she been in charge?

21:27.485 --> 21:28.485
Right.

23:31.942 --> 23:34.467
Flippity-flop and slide to the side.

23:34.545 --> 23:37.605
- The joint is jumping.
- It's time to glide.

23:44.288 --> 23:46.756
Hey! But I got the kelp yesterday.

23:48.559 --> 23:50.493
It's not fair.

23:50.561 --> 23:53.496
I'm weak. Pathetic.

23:53.564 --> 23:55.691
I'm a lowly errand boy.

24:03.774 --> 24:05.765
Oh, it's about that time.

24:06.710 --> 24:08.769
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey, hey!

24:13.050 --> 24:14.574
All right, let's bring it.

24:15.719 --> 24:17.311
You know what to do.

24:17.388 --> 24:18.650
- Ah!
- Ooh!

24:29.066 --> 24:32.524
<i><font color=yellow> Shake, shake, shake, Senora

Flounder!

24:48.652 --> 24:50.882
Ariel?

24:50.954 --> 24:52.216
Oh, no.

24:54.091 --> 24:56.582
Oh, Flounder.

24:59.730 --> 25:01.630
- Sebastian!
- Whoo!

25:01.699 --> 25:05.191
<i><font color=yellow> My girl's name is Senora

25:41.772 --> 25:44.741
- Aah!
- Love your club.

25:44.808 --> 25:46.332
Huh?

25:52.416 --> 25:54.782
Oh, wait! I won't tell.

25:54.852 --> 25:57.286
Wait a minute. I won't tell!

26:19.076 --> 26:20.338
Oh!

26:42.399 --> 26:44.367
<i><font color=yellow> La, la, la, la, la</i>

26:44.435 --> 26:46.801

<i><font color=yellow> Endless sky</i>

<i><font color=yellow> Wait, I remember that</i>

27:05.956 --> 27:07.924
<i><font color=yellow> How I know that song</i>

27:07.991 --> 27:13.554
<i><font color=yellow> I remember sitting in the moonlight
and that feeling</i>

27:13.630 --> 27:16.827
<i><font color=yellow> What's that feeling?</i>

27:16.900 --> 27:21.997
<i><font color=yellow> I remember, yes</i>

27:22.072 --> 27:25.735
<i><font color=yellow> How I know that song
Though it's been so long</i>

27:25.809 --> 27:30.143
<i><font color=yellow> I remember happiness
without a floor or ceiling</i>

27:30.214 --> 27:32.682
<i><font color=yellow> What's that feeling?</i>

27:32.749 --> 27:36.480
<i><font color=yellow> I remember</i>

27:36.553 --> 27:40.216
<i><font color=yellow> La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la</i>

27:51.201 --> 27:53.931
<i><font color=yellow> Oh! I remember her</i>

27:54.004 --> 27:55.562
<i><font color=yellow> And how we were</i>

27:55.639 --> 27:58.938
<i><font color=yellow> I remember wanting
what the evening would be bringing</i>

27:59.042 --> 28:00.907
<i><font color=yellow> I remember singing</i>

28:00.944 --> 28:03.777
<i><font color=yellow> Under the bright blue</i>

28:03.847 --> 28:07.283
<i><font color=yellow> Endless sky</i>

<i><font color=yellow> Waves try to measure the days</i>

<i><font color=yellow> That we treasure</i>

<i><font color=yellow> And I</i>

28:16.994 --> 28:18.621
<i><font color=yellow> I remember</i>

28:18.695 --> 28:21.459
<i><font color=yellow> I remember music</i>

28:21.532 --> 28:25.229
<i><font color=yellow> And I'm never going back
to the silent law they wrote</i>

28:25.302 --> 28:29.568
<i><font color=yellow> I will sing in every tempo
Every last chromatic note</i>

<i><font color=yellow> I remember music</i>

<i><font color=yellow> And I remember</i>

28:42.386 --> 28:46.152
<i><font color=yellow>-  Love</font>
- This can't happen!</i>

28:46.223 --> 28:49.158
<i><font color=yellow>Your father is the king!</i>

28:51.562 --> 28:52.995
Swifty.

28:53.063 --> 28:55.054
Do you promise to jump, jive, wail,
groove, rock steady,

28:55.132 --> 28:57.464
and lend a helping hand
to your fellow music lovers?

28:57.568 --> 28:59.870
- I do.
- She's in.

29:11.615 --> 29:14.175
Good morning, Your Highness.

29:14.251 --> 29:16.048
Sebastian. Marina.

29:16.119 --> 29:18.849
Good morning, Your Majesty.

29:21.091 --> 29:22.820
I have a problem.

29:23.994 --> 29:27.430
- It's Ariel.
- Ariel? I...

29:27.497 --> 29:30.955
Finally! So you see it, too? Oh, yes.

29:31.034 --> 29:33.696
She's rebellious, insubordinate,
headstrong.

29:33.770 --> 29:37.228
We need to immediately implement
a series of checks and balances

29:37.307 --> 29:39.104
designed to crush her spirit.

29:40.444 --> 29:42.275
What? Too harsh?

29:42.346 --> 29:47.113
Absolutely! Your Highness,
she is young, going through a phase.

29:47.184 --> 29:50.711
I don't remember having this much
trouble with any of her sisters.

29:50.787 --> 29:54.883
I do! They're all a handful.
We should shave their heads.

29:54.958 --> 29:56.983
Just kidding.

29:57.060 --> 29:59.893
- Alana wasn't difficult at all.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

29:59.963 --> 30:02.625
But Arista and the blowfish incident,
remember?

30:02.699 --> 30:04.667
Oh! It took weeks
to clean up the palace.

30:04.735 --> 30:07.295
And how about Aquata
and that stingray?

30:07.371 --> 30:09.532
- I can still feel it.
- Well...

30:09.606 --> 30:12.734
Or the time Attina got her head
stuck in the conch shell.

30:12.809 --> 30:13.867
That was me.

30:13.944 --> 30:16.970
Well, perhaps you're right, Sebastian.

30:17.047 --> 30:19.709
Still, it seems Marina
could use some help.

30:19.783 --> 30:23.913
I want you to look after Ariel.
No offense, Marina.

30:23.987 --> 30:25.921
None taken.

30:25.989 --> 30:29.356
- Soft shell. Stick eye.
- Tardy girl. Fish lips.

30:29.426 --> 30:33.226
- Backstabber. Bottom feeder!
- Fashion disaster. Babysitter!

30:33.296 --> 30:34.729
Dismissed.

30:40.170 --> 30:42.195
<i><font color=yellow> La, la, la, la, la</i>

30:47.177 --> 30:48.735
What?

30:49.646 --> 30:50.738
What?

30:50.814 --> 30:54.807
- Uh... You were humming.
- I was?

30:54.885 --> 30:57.718
- Out loud.
- Don't worry.

30:57.821 --> 31:00.949
- It was just a dream.
- I'll tell you what wasn't a dream.

31:00.991 --> 31:03.983
- We woke up at midnight.
- And your bed was still empty.

31:04.061 --> 31:07.519
- Really?
- Yeah. That is two hours past curfew.

31:07.597 --> 31:10.065
- Oh.
- Ooh, was it a boy?

31:10.133 --> 31:13.534
- If it's a boy, I'm gonna die.
- Ugh... Drama.

31:13.603 --> 31:15.798
I mean, I'm happy for you, Ariel.

31:15.872 --> 31:19.035
It's just that I'm two years
older than you,

31:19.109 --> 31:22.169
and the only one I've come
even close to kissing is Stevie.

31:22.245 --> 31:25.271
- Ew! Squid-Lips Stevie?
- It was on a dare.

31:25.348 --> 31:29.011
- Whatever.
- Girls, let's stick to the subject.

31:29.886 --> 31:32.218
Well, it wasn't a boy, OK?

31:32.289 --> 31:36.487
I was just helping a friend.
Out past the kelp forest.

31:37.127 --> 31:40.961
Ooh! Past the kelp forest.
It wasn't a boy.

31:41.031 --> 31:43.397
It was a bad boy.

31:43.467 --> 31:45.901
- Oh, Ariel.
- Simmer down there, sister.

31:45.969 --> 31:49.097
- So you were just helping a friend?
- Um... Yep.

31:49.172 --> 31:51.572
Then, where'd you get... this!

31:53.777 --> 31:56.439
Can you imagine
what'd happen if Dad found it?

31:56.513 --> 31:58.606
- He's never here.
- Don't get cute with me.

31:58.715 --> 32:01.707
This is serious. Where were you?

32:06.223 --> 32:11.627
I was just... listening to music
in an underground club.

32:11.695 --> 32:13.788
OK, where were you really?

32:15.699 --> 32:19.191
- Listening to music?
- No way.

32:19.269 --> 32:22.033
- What was it like?
- Come on. Spill it.

32:22.105 --> 32:25.006
Oh, it was amazing.

32:25.075 --> 32:28.533
The energy, the dancing, the music...

32:28.612 --> 32:31.809
Just makes you feel like...

32:31.882 --> 32:33.907
Like what?

32:34.885 --> 32:36.876
Like when Mom was here.

32:43.827 --> 32:46.694
Ariel, I wanna hear it, too.

32:46.763 --> 32:48.355
- You do?
- Me, too.

32:48.431 --> 32:50.592
- OK. Me, too.
- Me, too! Me, too!

32:50.667 --> 32:52.794
- Not without me.
- Yeah. Everybody does.

32:52.869 --> 32:55.429
Please, Ariel. Please?

32:55.505 --> 32:58.030
- Well...
- Oh!

32:58.775 --> 33:00.743
- We'll go tonight.
- I'm so excited!

33:00.811 --> 33:02.335
- Music!
- What should I wear?

33:02.412 --> 33:04.243
So you think there'll be boys?

33:04.314 --> 33:06.714
- One way to find out.
- This is not happening!

33:06.783 --> 33:09.650
You go again and I...

33:09.719 --> 33:12.517
- Oh, lighten up.
- Come on.

33:13.723 --> 33:15.418
Mmm?

33:16.259 --> 33:18.989
OK.

33:19.095 --> 33:21.120
Come on, girls. Uppy-up.

33:29.072 --> 33:31.404
- Morning.
- They're early.

33:31.474 --> 33:34.534
Yes. But why?

33:38.815 --> 33:41.875
Get your sea kelp. Salty or extra salty.

33:41.952 --> 33:45.217
Hey, Ray-Ray. You gonna
rock the house tonight?

33:45.288 --> 33:47.756
Well, wouldn't be here
just for the halibut.

33:47.824 --> 33:49.951
- Oh, Ray-Ray.
- This is so exciting!

33:50.026 --> 33:52.551
Hey, you're in my personal space.

33:52.629 --> 33:55.427
- Stop pushing me.
- OK, bossy. Whatever.

34:03.773 --> 34:07.106
- Music!
- I know! Isn't it fantastic?

34:07.177 --> 34:10.304
- And we're here together!
- Yeah!

34:10.380 --> 34:12.313
Boys, here I come!

34:15.385 --> 34:19.116
Wow. This really is... fantastic.

34:19.188 --> 34:22.989
- Yeah. I'm scared!
- Me, too.

34:23.059 --> 34:25.391
- I thought I was the only one.
- No, no, no, no...

34:25.462 --> 34:28.829
Ladies and gentlemen,
The Catfish Club is proud to present...

34:28.899 --> 34:29.956
Let's just go!

34:30.033 --> 34:32.297
The original rock lobster.

34:32.369 --> 34:37.170
The one, the only, red tornado!

34:39.074 --> 34:41.270
<i><font color=yellow> Chick-a-chicka, chick-a-chicka, hey!</i>

34:41.344 --> 34:44.780
- All right, mon.
- Sebastian?

34:44.848 --> 34:47.339
- Way to go, Sebastian!
- I love you, Sebastian.

34:47.417 --> 34:48.940
- Hi!
- Whoo!

34:50.887 --> 34:53.014
OK. Where are the boys?

34:53.956 --> 34:56.755
Are you a boy? Good enough.

34:56.826 --> 34:58.953
Whoa! I'm Adella.

35:01.131 --> 35:04.123
This is the most exciting thing
that's ever happened to me!

35:09.639 --> 35:11.732
- Would you like to dance?
- No, thanks.

35:21.251 --> 35:23.685
- Let's dance.
- No, thanks.

35:35.198 --> 35:36.859
Would ya like to dance?

35:36.933 --> 35:39.458
I can't dance, OK?

35:39.536 --> 35:41.504
I'm a mermaid with no grace.

35:41.571 --> 35:44.165
I look like a spastic piece of kelp.

35:44.874 --> 35:45.874
Let's go.

35:45.942 --> 35:48.376
Seriously. No, I mean it.
You guys, I can't...

35:49.379 --> 35:50.710
Come on.

35:56.453 --> 35:58.045
- That's it!
- You've got it!

35:59.756 --> 36:01.781
She really can't dance.

36:10.567 --> 36:11.761
- Oh, wow!
- Yeah!

36:11.835 --> 36:14.668
There ain't no problem with that.
Ah-cha, cha, cha.

36:14.738 --> 36:15.762
Thank you.

36:17.841 --> 36:20.833
You were right, Ariel.
Mom would've loved this.

36:20.910 --> 36:22.468
- Yeah.
- Thanks!

36:22.545 --> 36:24.843
- You're the best.
- Really.

36:48.805 --> 36:49.931
Ha!

36:50.006 --> 36:52.634
Whoo-hoo!

36:53.343 --> 36:55.937
- Huh?
- Whoo!

36:56.212 --> 36:57.474
Ha!

37:04.621 --> 37:05.952
We be jammin', mon.

37:12.762 --> 37:14.286
That's right!

37:14.364 --> 37:16.889
- Good night, Ariel.
- Good night, Andrina.

37:16.966 --> 37:18.433
Zap-it-y-do-dah, zow!

37:18.501 --> 37:21.436
- Night, Arista.
- Sweet dreams, Ariel.

37:21.504 --> 37:23.699
- You, too, Alana.
- Good night, Adella.

37:23.773 --> 37:25.638
I still didn't get to kiss a boy.

37:26.709 --> 37:28.700
- Good night, Aquata.
- Night.

37:34.384 --> 37:35.908
Good night, Attina.

37:39.022 --> 37:41.047
Your Highness.

37:41.858 --> 37:43.450
We need to talk.

37:59.109 --> 38:00.667
Jumpin' jellyfish!

38:02.879 --> 38:05.848
Quick! This way!

38:11.221 --> 38:14.486
Hi.

38:24.834 --> 38:28.099
This is how you watch over
my daughter?

38:28.171 --> 38:30.901
- Sire, I...
- I trusted you.

38:30.974 --> 38:32.635
Sire.

38:34.277 --> 38:36.677
Guards! Lock him away.

38:37.780 --> 38:40.715
- What? No!
- Lock them all away!

38:40.783 --> 38:43.775
- But, Your Majesty, please!
- Come on. Let's move it.

38:45.121 --> 38:47.988
- I'm with the band.
- Sure you are, kid.

38:48.057 --> 38:52.687
Marina, you will take over
Sebastian's duties immediately.

38:54.531 --> 38:56.192
As you wish.

38:56.799 --> 39:00.394
- Attina, take your sisters home.
- Yes, sir.

39:00.503 --> 39:05.236
- Father, you can't do this!
- It's already done!

39:16.953 --> 39:18.181
Aah!

39:31.568 --> 39:35.026
- You are all confined to the palace.
- Yes, Father.

39:35.104 --> 39:36.901
Why don't you just lock us in jail?

39:36.973 --> 39:40.238
Ariel, you are confined to the palace

39:40.310 --> 39:42.437
until you understand what you've done.

39:42.512 --> 39:45.072
What did we do? Tell me, Daddy...

39:45.148 --> 39:48.015
- Ariel, leave it alone.
- No.

39:48.084 --> 39:51.918
We haven't done anything wrong.
All we did was listen to music.

39:51.988 --> 39:56.823
- Which you know is forbidden!
- But why? Why can't we have music?

39:58.061 --> 40:00.256
- This discussion is over.
- Just tell me!

40:00.330 --> 40:03.663
I do not have to explain myself to you.

40:03.733 --> 40:06.497
I don't understand. We love music.

40:06.569 --> 40:09.402
I will not have music in my kingdom!

40:17.046 --> 40:20.140
I may not remember much
about my mother,

40:20.216 --> 40:23.276
but I know she wouldn't have
wanted this.

40:54.450 --> 40:56.042
Attina?

40:58.121 --> 41:00.419
You just don't know when to quit.

41:05.461 --> 41:06.928
What?

41:09.132 --> 41:10.929
It's over, Ariel.

41:12.602 --> 41:14.934
But... we were finally happy.

41:15.905 --> 41:17.395
Look around, Ariel.

41:19.475 --> 41:21.443
No one's happy.

41:22.111 --> 41:23.169
Yahoo!

41:30.553 --> 41:33.044
- Who is that?
- I don't know, but she scares me.

41:33.122 --> 41:34.612
Whee!

41:35.792 --> 41:37.589
Uh! Don't touch me.

41:37.660 --> 41:40.629
Benjamin, tear out those puny windows.

41:40.697 --> 41:43.029
- Rip down those narrow walls.
- Oh, no.

41:43.099 --> 41:46.296
This is just the beginning.
I want a balcony

41:46.369 --> 41:48.929
so I can wave down
to the adoring crowds.

41:49.005 --> 41:51.701
But high enough so they
can't see disdain on my face.

41:51.774 --> 41:55.107
Can you taste it, Benjamin?
The sweet taste of power!

41:55.178 --> 41:58.443
Filling, yet oddly minty!

41:58.548 --> 42:00.880
<i><font color=yellow> Hello, world</i>

42:00.917 --> 42:03.784
<i><font color=yellow> It's Marina Del Rey</i>

42:04.654 --> 42:06.519
<i><font color=yellow> I'm the new attaché</i>

42:06.589 --> 42:11.049
<i><font color=yellow> But I want more</i>

42:12.929 --> 42:16.194
<i><font color=yellow> And I'm never going back</i>

42:16.265 --> 42:19.792
<i><font color=yellow> Did you get that, clawboy?
No, I'm never going back...</i>

42:19.869 --> 42:21.461
Delivery for Miss Del Rey.

42:21.537 --> 42:24.665
<i><font color=yellow> Make no mistake
I'm here to stay</i>

42:24.741 --> 42:26.936
<i><font color=yellow> Oh... OK.</i>

42:27.009 --> 42:29.000
<i><font color=yellow> Meet the new</i>

42:29.078 --> 42:33.378
<i><font color=yellow> Marina Del Rey</i>

42:33.449 --> 42:36.907
She does seem happier. Oh!

42:37.820 --> 42:41.381
- How long has she been in charge?
- We're going on... seven minutes.

43:04.781 --> 43:10.447
<i><font color=yellow> I remember</i>

44:51.487 --> 44:54.012
I got to get out of here.
I got to get out.

44:54.090 --> 44:57.958
The walls, they're closing in.
There's no space! No air!

45:02.231 --> 45:04.631
I got it! We'll start a riot!

45:04.700 --> 45:06.497
Follow my lead.

45:06.569 --> 45:09.561
Atlantica! Atlantica!

45:09.639 --> 45:11.573
Join me, guys. Atlantica!

45:11.641 --> 45:13.609
- Hey, Ink Spot.
- Yeah?

45:17.113 --> 45:19.741
This ain't living.
You know what I'm saying?

45:19.815 --> 45:23.114
And the acoustics are non-good-ular.
Listen.

45:23.185 --> 45:25.176
<i><font color=yellow> Do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti, do</i>

45:25.254 --> 45:28.587
Come on, at least we're hanging out.
Can I get a "hoo-yah?"

45:30.159 --> 45:33.993
Come on, guys. This looks
a lot worse than it is.

45:34.063 --> 45:36.964
I'll just get an audience
with the king and I'll fix it.

45:37.033 --> 45:40.196
Now, no offense, man,
but you had ten years to fix it,

45:40.269 --> 45:43.136
- and this is where we end up?
- In jail.

45:44.273 --> 45:46.468
Well, I...

45:49.211 --> 45:54.274
The band has talked it up, see,
and we want you to...

45:54.350 --> 45:57.615
- Slip through the bars.
- Use your claws to pick the lock, man.

45:57.720 --> 46:00.746
- And open that door!
- Good plan. Good plan.

46:00.790 --> 46:03.418
- Solid.
- Liquid!

46:03.492 --> 46:05.756
- Just kidding.
- No, bad plan!

46:05.828 --> 46:09.423
If we break out of this jail, there
ain't no coming back here, mon!

46:09.498 --> 46:11.489
We'll be fugitives!

46:12.768 --> 46:14.759
- That's cool.
- That works.

46:14.837 --> 46:16.236
What's a fugitive?

46:16.305 --> 46:19.240
What about Ariel?
You just going to abandon her?

46:19.308 --> 46:21.742
Leave her to deal with all
that we tangled her up in?

46:21.811 --> 46:25.508
You think that small, weak,
innocent, helpless little girl

46:25.581 --> 46:28.550
can do anything by herself? Oh!

46:28.618 --> 46:30.882
- Ariel?
- Come on, Sebastian. Let's go.

46:30.953 --> 46:33.387
- I'm with her.
- If we run away from Atlantica,

46:33.456 --> 46:37.051
- it will break your father's heart.
- She got to do what she got to do.

46:37.126 --> 46:39.890
- I'm sorry. I just can't live here.
- Yeah, let's go.

46:39.962 --> 46:43.762
Listen, I will not be responsible
for taking you away from your family.

46:43.833 --> 46:45.733
I'm leaving! With or without you.

46:45.801 --> 46:48.463
- All right!
- Nobody's leaving!

46:48.537 --> 46:50.402
- Except you.
- Mmm-hmm.

46:50.473 --> 46:55.740
Look, Sebastian, without music,
this place just isn't home.

46:55.811 --> 46:58.780
- You know she ain't lying.
- Ain't no comeback to that!

46:58.881 --> 47:00.075
You got that right.

47:03.452 --> 47:05.420
Ha! Oh, no, no, no.

47:07.523 --> 47:11.084
Never mind.

47:12.328 --> 47:15.627
- Are you OK?
- Ariel, you're right!

47:15.698 --> 47:20.601
Without music,
this place just isn't home.

47:20.670 --> 47:22.763
I know just where to go!

47:22.838 --> 47:24.271
Freedom!

47:33.315 --> 47:34.646
Oh...

47:34.717 --> 47:38.483
Aw...

47:47.029 --> 47:49.054
OK...

47:49.398 --> 47:54.165
Oh!

47:59.608 --> 48:00.608
Oh, dear.

48:01.110 --> 48:03.203
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

48:05.147 --> 48:08.139
Flounder, shh!
Move it, move it, move it, mon.

48:08.217 --> 48:11.084
- Move it, move it, move it.
- Flounder, please!

48:12.755 --> 48:15.087
Shh!

48:15.291 --> 48:17.020
This way. Come on.

48:17.827 --> 48:20.295
- Flounder, shh! Be quiet.
- Ditto!

48:20.362 --> 48:22.353
Shh!

48:22.431 --> 48:26.026
Yeah! Hit me!

48:26.102 --> 48:30.835
Hey, small fry, I think you could
use some lessons in fugitivity.

48:31.440 --> 48:32.907
Oh, yeah. Right. Got it.

48:34.910 --> 48:37.037
You're gonna blow it for all of us.

48:37.113 --> 48:39.843
Blow, good.

48:39.915 --> 48:42.383
Hey, kid, ixnay on the soundtrack.

48:42.451 --> 48:46.615
- Why?
- Why? Why? Why? Try jail!

48:46.689 --> 48:48.054
- Prison!
- The big house!

48:48.124 --> 48:51.457
- The slammer!
- Music is against the law, you dig?

48:52.061 --> 48:53.585
Not out here.

48:54.130 --> 48:56.064
- What?
- Come on.

48:56.132 --> 48:59.397
We ran away so we could sing.
And I'm singing.

49:06.542 --> 49:08.874
You know, the kid's
striking a major chord.

49:08.944 --> 49:10.741
I feel it, I feel it.

49:10.813 --> 49:12.906

50:03.199 --> 50:05.861
<i><font color=yellow> Jump in the line
Rock your body in time</i>

50:05.935 --> 50:07.459
Try and stop me!

50:07.536 --> 50:10.334
<i><font color=yellow> Jump in the line
Rock your body in time</i>

50:10.406 --> 50:11.839
Oh, yeah, take me with you.

<i><font color=yellow> Jump in the line
Rock your body on time</i>

50:13.809 --> 50:16.471
- Come on, guys. This way.
- All right.

50:16.545 --> 50:18.513
- OK.
- Let's step-a-doodle.

50:18.581 --> 50:20.378
<i><font color=yellow> Jump in the line
Rock your body on time</i>

50:20.449 --> 50:23.941
- Where are we going exactly?
- Don't worry, mon.

50:24.019 --> 50:26.112
'Cause I got to go
to the bathroom.

50:26.188 --> 50:27.712
Oh, Flounder.

50:32.695 --> 50:35.323
And thanks to my
bold new initiatives,

50:35.397 --> 50:39.163
second only to my fabulous day wear
and dressy evening separates,

50:39.235 --> 50:42.033
productivity in all sectors
is up 20 percent.

50:43.439 --> 50:45.964
Squids are producing more ink,
kelp more oxygen,

50:46.041 --> 50:50.637
and the coral reef is just churning
out the plankton. Chuga, chuga!

50:50.713 --> 50:54.046
I do so enjoy fresh plankton
on my salad, don't you?

50:56.051 --> 50:57.712
I'll take that as a yes.

50:58.888 --> 51:01.083
As you can see, I'm...

51:03.792 --> 51:06.192
I'm a self-starter, Your Majesty,

51:06.262 --> 51:08.958
here to anticipate your every need.

51:09.031 --> 51:11.192
Not like that last guy.
What was his name?

51:11.267 --> 51:13.394
Sooner we forget about him,
the better.

51:13.469 --> 51:17.838
In fact, let's make a vow
never to mention his name again.

51:17.907 --> 51:19.670
Here, I'll start.

51:20.943 --> 51:23.275
There. Wasn't that easy?

51:23.345 --> 51:24.744
- Marina.
- Busy!

51:24.813 --> 51:27.475
- I think I was too hard on them.
- Huh?

51:27.549 --> 51:29.574
- It's about Ariel.
- Not now!

51:29.652 --> 51:33.554
- Perhaps I went too far.
- Nonsense, Your Highness. Not possible.

51:34.690 --> 51:35.884
- Marina.
- What?

51:35.958 --> 51:37.152
- Daddy!
- Huh?

51:37.226 --> 51:39.160
- Ariel's missing.
- What?

51:39.228 --> 51:41.287
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I just... did.

51:41.363 --> 51:43.661
We can't find her!
We've looked everywhere!

51:44.967 --> 51:48.027
Don't worry. I'll find her.

51:48.103 --> 51:49.365
Get me Sebastian!

51:49.438 --> 51:53.033
What, what! No, no, no!
No, I'm in charge here! Well...

51:53.108 --> 51:54.973
Sebastian's gone, too.

51:56.011 --> 51:58.036
Guards! Search the palace.

51:58.147 --> 52:00.206
Search every inch of Atlantica!

52:00.249 --> 52:02.308
Find my daughter!

52:02.384 --> 52:04.944
Your Majesty. Whoo-hoo!

52:05.020 --> 52:07.011
Your Majesty, Your Majesty.

52:19.535 --> 52:21.127
Sebastian.

52:22.338 --> 52:23.737
- Are we there yet?
- No.

52:25.874 --> 52:27.535
- Are we there yet?
- No.

52:28.010 --> 52:29.534
- Are we there yet?
- No.

52:29.611 --> 52:31.078
- Are we there yet?
- No.

52:31.880 --> 52:34.348
- Are we there yet?
- Yes. This is it.

52:37.820 --> 52:38.980
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

52:39.054 --> 52:40.419
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

52:40.489 --> 52:41.717
- Are you s?
- Yes!

52:41.790 --> 52:44.657
Oh, man. We can't live here!

52:44.727 --> 52:48.959
Yeah, this place is all "Oom-pa-pa."
We need some...

52:49.031 --> 52:50.794
Nonsense. It's perfect.

52:50.866 --> 52:54.199
<i><font color=yellow> Do, re, me, fa, so, la, ti, do</i>

52:54.303 --> 52:56.703
<i><font color=yellow> Do, Do, Do...</i>

52:57.373 --> 52:58.635
Solid.

53:00.909 --> 53:03.377
Well, it beats the dungeon.

53:04.446 --> 53:06.437
But not by much.

53:06.515 --> 53:08.983
It'll do for the time being. Excuse me.

53:14.089 --> 53:16.250
Ooh...

53:17.092 --> 53:21.495
Sebastian, be honest. Are we lost?

53:21.563 --> 53:23.656
No, this is fine.

53:23.732 --> 53:26.360
There's more to this place
than meets the eye.

53:36.145 --> 53:39.342
- Knock it off!
- Sorry.

53:41.550 --> 53:44.678
- Give me the key!
- I said no.

53:44.753 --> 53:48.154
Look, I haven't worked my tail off
for the last 12 hours

53:48.223 --> 53:51.624
- just to have it snatched away.
- How about a nice relaxing bath?

53:51.693 --> 53:54.161
- Benjamin.
- Kelp wrap? Lomi lomi rub?

53:54.229 --> 53:55.560
Give me the key!

53:55.631 --> 53:57.929
You said never give it to you
in a fit of rage!

53:58.033 --> 54:00.467
- I'm perfectly calm!
- Doesn't sound it.

54:00.502 --> 54:03.232
- Give! Give!
- Oh!

54:03.305 --> 54:05.500
- Mm-mmm.
- Give!

54:07.176 --> 54:09.542
- Oh, look at the pretty fishies.
- Really? Where?

54:09.611 --> 54:11.306
Oh!

54:11.380 --> 54:14.372
Ooh, yum-yums!

54:15.250 --> 54:17.115
Come to Mommy.

54:20.956 --> 54:23.652
Oh, yes. Mommy wuvs you.

54:23.725 --> 54:26.250
OK, I'm not gonna watch this part.

54:26.328 --> 54:30.890
My, my, are you hungry? Ooh...

54:30.999 --> 54:35.527
- Who wants crab cakes?
- What are you going to do?

54:35.604 --> 54:38.596
Whatever it takes
to get rid of Sebastian!

54:38.674 --> 54:41.871
- But what about Ariel?
- Ariel? Ariel?

54:41.944 --> 54:44.139
You're right. She'll tattle.

54:44.746 --> 54:46.873
- I'll have to get rid of her, too.
- What?

54:46.949 --> 54:51.283
- That's brilliant, Benjamin, brilliant!
- OK, that wasn't what I meant.

54:51.353 --> 54:54.550
I never liked her anyway.
I'll make it look like an accident.

54:54.623 --> 54:57.683
That's it! An accidental
underwater ambush

54:57.793 --> 55:00.785
by a team of the cutest
wittle yum-yums ever.

55:00.829 --> 55:04.128
- You've lost your mind.
- Sic 'em, boys!

55:04.199 --> 55:07.134
Ooh, what hath we wrought?

55:07.202 --> 55:09.432
Oh, swim, you pretties.

55:09.505 --> 55:13.373
Swim, you pretties. Faster! Swim.

55:13.442 --> 55:15.467
Wait up!

55:48.010 --> 55:50.740
- Sebastian.
- Five more minutes, Mommy.

55:50.812 --> 55:53.679
Sebastian, did you hear that?

55:53.749 --> 55:56.081
Leave me alone. Sleeping.

55:56.151 --> 56:00.417
But there's something out there.
Come on, help me find it.

56:00.522 --> 56:03.252
I'm tired. You go check it out.

57:16.898 --> 57:19.366
It was an anniversary present.

57:20.636 --> 57:24.595
Your father had the music box
made for your mother.

57:24.673 --> 57:27.267
Athena was more than his queen,
you know.

57:28.243 --> 57:30.507
She was his best friend.

57:45.661 --> 57:47.128
<i>The family together.</i>

57:50.265 --> 57:53.132
<i>Music playing all the time.</i>

57:58.473 --> 58:02.739
<i>The palace
always echoing with laughter.</i>

58:12.954 --> 58:17.550
When your mother died,
the whole kingdom was heartbroken.

58:18.226 --> 58:21.889
The heart that never healed
was your father's.

58:30.839 --> 58:32.773
It's so sad.

58:32.841 --> 58:37.175
He's forgotten
what it feels like to be happy.

58:40.716 --> 58:44.447
I... I have to bring this back to him.

58:45.120 --> 58:46.712
If you insist.

58:48.123 --> 58:51.422
This is why we came here, isn't it?

58:53.929 --> 58:57.126
Whoa, whoa, let me get this straight.
You led us out here...

58:57.199 --> 58:58.791
To the armpit of nowhere, man.

58:58.867 --> 59:01.392
In the hope that Red
might find the music box.

59:01.470 --> 59:03.665
And now you wanna go back
to the palace...

59:03.739 --> 59:07.869
- To return the music box to the king...
- On the chance that maybe it'll...

59:07.943 --> 59:11.276
Remind him to remember
how to be happy...

59:11.346 --> 59:14.110
And then he'll bring music back?

59:14.182 --> 59:16.047
That about sums it up.

59:16.118 --> 59:19.610
Couldn't we just strap it to a dolphin?
He'd get it eventually.

59:27.028 --> 59:30.691
Listen, the band talked it over, and...

59:30.766 --> 59:32.825
We just can't take that chance.

59:32.901 --> 59:33.993
- What?
- Huh?

59:34.069 --> 59:38.267
It's OK. Maybe someday
it'll be different.

59:38.774 --> 59:41.174
You'll come home
and play music all you want.

59:42.177 --> 59:44.611
Sure, Red. Someday.

59:45.647 --> 59:48.707
- Someday.
- Bye.

59:51.319 --> 59:54.720
What? No, no, wait. Ray-Ray!

59:54.790 --> 59:57.452
Guys! We can't just let them
go back alone.

59:57.526 --> 01:00:00.256
- Drop it, small fry.
- But we took an oath!

01:00:00.328 --> 01:00:04.059
To jump, jive, wail, groove,
rock steady, and at all times

01:00:04.132 --> 01:00:06.692
lend a helping hand
to your fellow music lovers!

01:00:06.768 --> 01:00:10.431
The Catfish Club is history.
That oath don't mean a thing.

01:00:14.409 --> 01:00:16.809
Well, it still means something to me.

01:00:16.878 --> 01:00:19.938
Hey, Ariel! Wait up! Ariel!

01:00:28.523 --> 01:00:32.186
I don't remember this much kelp
when we came through here last night.

01:00:32.794 --> 01:00:34.523
Oh!

01:00:34.596 --> 01:00:37.690
Kelp, schmelp. I ain't afraid
of these overgrown weeds.

01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:41.098
Hi-yah!
Take that! And that!

01:00:53.114 --> 01:00:55.548
Guys? That ain't kelp!

01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:01.445
- Surprise!
- Marina?

01:01:02.257 --> 01:01:06.250
- What are you wearing?
- I thought I'd dress for the occasion.

01:01:06.328 --> 01:01:07.727
What's the occasion?

01:01:10.065 --> 01:01:14.126
- Go, go, go, go!
- Sic 'em, boys.

01:01:21.476 --> 01:01:22.670
Keep going!

01:01:29.918 --> 01:01:32.944
- Ah!
- Ow!

01:01:35.657 --> 01:01:37.557
That... hurt.

01:01:39.427 --> 01:01:41.622
This way. Quick!

01:01:43.698 --> 01:01:45.029
Where's Sebastian?

01:02:06.421 --> 01:02:09.288
I've tasted power, Sebastian.

01:02:09.357 --> 01:02:12.793
- And I'm never letting go.
- Bring it on!

01:02:16.464 --> 01:02:18.125
Come to daddy.

01:02:21.069 --> 01:02:22.934
Hi-yah! Hi-yah! Hi-yah!

01:02:29.678 --> 01:02:32.704
Oh, my!

01:02:41.156 --> 01:02:42.714
- Now!
- Huh?

01:02:44.225 --> 01:02:46.750
Fire!

01:02:50.765 --> 01:02:52.892
Yeah! Awesome!

01:02:53.501 --> 01:02:56.163
- Ooh, they hurtin' for certain.
- Yup, yup, yup.

01:02:56.237 --> 01:02:58.569
- Sebastian's in trouble!
- Follow me!

01:02:58.673 --> 01:03:00.732
- Let's go.
- Right in your wake, kid.

01:03:04.145 --> 01:03:07.308
- The music box!
- Ariel!

01:03:07.382 --> 01:03:08.382
Huh?

01:03:12.754 --> 01:03:14.085
How do you like that?

01:03:16.124 --> 01:03:18.991
Oops.

01:03:19.527 --> 01:03:20.926
Flounder!

01:03:22.330 --> 01:03:26.027
- Come on, try and get me.
- Get back here!

01:03:26.101 --> 01:03:28.092
Ow!

01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:30.563
<i><font color=yellow> Boom, chika, boom
Chika, boom, boom, boom!</i>

01:03:39.681 --> 01:03:40.943
Tight fit?

01:03:41.016 --> 01:03:43.075
You... stink.

01:03:46.788 --> 01:03:49.120
I win.

01:03:50.959 --> 01:03:53.655
- Flounder!
- Sebastian! Help!

01:03:53.728 --> 01:03:55.889
I got the tail.

01:03:58.133 --> 01:04:00.897
- Hey! Flounder at twelve o'clock!
- 12:04, actually.

01:04:00.969 --> 01:04:02.960
- Flounder.
- Whoa!

01:04:03.838 --> 01:04:07.035
- Do the corkscrew!
- Break out all the utensils.

01:04:08.243 --> 01:04:11.610
Whoa, whoa!

01:04:13.481 --> 01:04:14.948
- Who the fish?
- That's it.

01:04:15.016 --> 01:04:17.041
Go, Flounder! Go, go!

01:04:23.191 --> 01:04:25.182
You slippery eel!

01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:27.888
Yeah, mon, just like we planned it.

01:04:27.962 --> 01:04:30.430
Way to go, Flounder, you did it!

01:04:31.833 --> 01:04:34.358
- We did it, mon.
- We sure did.

01:04:34.436 --> 01:04:37.564
- Solid.
- Come on. Let's go!

01:04:43.044 --> 01:04:46.172
- Sebastian!
- Look out!

01:04:48.216 --> 01:04:49.649
Ariel! No!

01:05:20.014 --> 01:05:25.850
<i>What have I done?</i>

01:05:51.346 --> 01:05:54.213
<i><font color=yellow> Endless sky</i>

01:05:57.152 --> 01:06:01.350
<i><font color=yellow> Waves try to measure</i>

01:06:01.422 --> 01:06:05.153
<i><font color=yellow> The days that we treasure</i>

01:06:17.338 --> 01:06:18.669
Daddy?

01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:22.232
I'm... I'm so sorry I didn't listen.

01:06:22.310 --> 01:06:24.301
- I'm sorry.
- Daddy.

01:06:25.313 --> 01:06:28.749
Let's go home.

01:06:33.788 --> 01:06:37.918
- Guys, you came back.
- Sure did, small fry.

01:06:37.992 --> 01:06:41.052
Like you said, we took an oath.

01:06:41.129 --> 01:06:43.256
Come here, you little knucklehead.

01:06:43.331 --> 01:06:45.595
- Group hug!
- We dig you, man.

01:06:45.667 --> 01:06:47.726
Guys... can't breathe.

01:06:49.637 --> 01:06:50.968
Mmm.

01:06:51.306 --> 01:06:53.399
<i>So, Ariel came back home</i>

01:06:53.474 --> 01:06:56.875
<i>and life went on
just the same as before.</i>

01:06:58.813 --> 01:07:02.476
<i>Well, things weren't exactly the same.</i>

01:07:02.550 --> 01:07:03.949
Rise and shine.

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:06.810
It's a beautiful day.

01:07:06.888 --> 01:07:08.753
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

01:07:19.234 --> 01:07:23.830
To my daughters,
and to all the citizens of Atlantica,

01:07:23.905 --> 01:07:28.842
I hereby decree that music
will once again ring clear

01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:32.437
from one end of my kingdom
to the other!

01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:37.382
Therefore, I hereby present

01:07:37.452 --> 01:07:40.944
Atlantica's first
official Court Composer.

01:07:41.022 --> 01:07:43.490
- Yeah, yeah!
- Fabulous!

01:07:47.795 --> 01:07:49.956
Thank you, Your Highness.

01:07:50.465 --> 01:07:54.265
Uh, not that we don't trust you,
Your Majesty, but...

01:07:54.335 --> 01:07:56.394
Swifty, hit it, mon.

01:07:57.238 --> 01:08:00.207
Raise your right hand,
fin, claw, tentacle,

01:08:00.275 --> 01:08:01.742
or whatever the case may be.

01:08:01.809 --> 01:08:04.539
Very good. Do you promise
to jump, jive, wail, groove,

01:08:04.612 --> 01:08:08.013
and at all times lend a helping hand
to your fellow music lovers?

01:08:08.082 --> 01:08:11.347
Um... I do?

01:08:14.956 --> 01:08:16.423
Thank you, Ariel.

01:08:19.661 --> 01:08:20.661
Yoo-hoo!

01:08:20.728 --> 01:08:23.890
<i><font color=yellow> My love is higher than the sky</i>

01:08:23.965 --> 01:08:27.366
<i><font color=yellow> Deeper than the ocean
Warmer than the sun</i>

01:08:27.435 --> 01:08:29.698
<i><font color=yellow> Shining down on me</i>

01:08:29.770 --> 01:08:31.738
<i><font color=yellow> Quiet as a prayer</i>

01:08:31.805 --> 01:08:33.636
- A girl in the band?
- That's right.

01:08:33.707 --> 01:08:36.904
<i><font color=yellow> All my love</i>

01:08:36.978 --> 01:08:40.778
<i><font color=yellow> I will sing
Of joy and glory</i>

01:08:40.848 --> 01:08:45.011
<i><font color=yellow> I will sing
The look in your eyes</i>

01:08:45.086 --> 01:08:46.576
<i><font color=yellow> I will sing</i>

01:08:46.654 --> 01:08:49.850
<i><font color=yellow> Till all the world knows your story</i>

01:08:49.924 --> 01:08:53.951
<i><font color=yellow> I will sing
For the rest of my life</i>

01:09:21.823 --> 01:09:24.553
Daddy, how about a dance?

01:09:25.225 --> 01:09:28.093
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

01:09:28.830 --> 01:09:31.731
Whoo! Conga!

01:09:31.799 --> 01:09:35.462
<i><font color=yellow> For the rest of my life</i>

01:09:40.841 --> 01:09:44.140
<i>So that's how
a king and a princess</i>

01:09:44.212 --> 01:09:48.046
<i>brought a family back to life.</i>

01:09:48.116 --> 01:09:50.845
<i>And, after ten years,</i>

01:09:50.917 --> 01:09:54.786
<i>love and music finally returned</i>

01:09:54.856 --> 01:09:57.791
<i>to the kingdom of Atlantica.</i>

01:10:06.868 --> 01:10:10.201
Let's think about what we've learned.
You just can't hurt people.

01:10:10.271 --> 01:10:13.206
Hurting is mean.
We don't want to be mean, do we?

01:10:18.813 --> 01:10:20.872
Maybe you're right.

01:10:20.948 --> 01:10:22.973
That's my girl.

01:10:23.051 --> 01:10:24.712
Samba?

01:10:37.198 --> 01:10:39.007
Ooh-wa,
ooh-wa!
