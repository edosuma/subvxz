WEBVTT

00:13.246 --> 00:15.783
We're still in the hall,
all right?

00:39.306 --> 00:42.443
I cannot believe you let them
bring you to this place.

00:42.443 --> 00:43.944
It's like Beirut.

00:45.278 --> 00:46.480
What are you doing here?

00:46.480 --> 00:48.649
You gave the paramedics
our old number.

00:48.649 --> 00:51.752
It must have been the only
one you had memorized.

00:51.752 --> 00:57.024
*155-6849 *

00:57.024 --> 01:01.128
* The only number
to keep in mind *

01:01.128 --> 01:02.596
Jesus Christ.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.532
Grandma Yetta
taught us to sing that

01:04.532 --> 01:06.634
in case
we were kidnapped.

01:08.436 --> 01:10.337
You're lucky I never
got rid of the landline.

01:10.337 --> 01:11.772
I am lucky. Thank you.

01:13.006 --> 01:14.442
Come on.

01:17.177 --> 01:18.446
Thank you.

01:18.446 --> 01:20.313
You're welcome.

01:20.313 --> 01:21.815
I need you
to do me a favor.

01:21.815 --> 01:23.651
- Sure.
- First of all,

01:23.651 --> 01:27.455
my name is not Feffman,
so change that.

01:27.455 --> 01:30.458
And can you change
the M, please?

01:30.458 --> 01:32.059
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

01:32.059 --> 01:33.193
No, I can't. I'm not--

01:33.193 --> 01:34.795
- Come the fuck on, Bryna.
- I am not a doctor!

01:34.795 --> 01:36.329
And I'm not going
to get in trouble

01:36.329 --> 01:37.598
for violating
hospital rules.

01:37.598 --> 01:38.632
God, what a baby.

01:38.632 --> 01:40.033
You are so ungrateful.

01:40.033 --> 01:41.134
Oh, go fuck yourself.

01:41.134 --> 01:42.102
I will.

01:43.971 --> 01:46.474
**

02:31.384 --> 02:32.886
Oh, my God.

02:32.886 --> 02:35.689
Just hold your breath.
Hold your breath.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.791
There's another
person in there.

02:37.791 --> 02:39.292
Is there another
person in here?

02:40.694 --> 02:42.429
- What is she doing?
- I don't know.

02:42.429 --> 02:44.331
- Is she awake?
- She looks mad.

02:44.331 --> 02:45.599
We should back it up.

02:45.599 --> 02:47.234
Maybe we should wait
in the hallway.

02:47.234 --> 02:48.902
- We should go--
- Let's go get coffee.

02:48.902 --> 02:50.437
Let's not
wake her up.

02:50.437 --> 02:51.772
- Oh.
- Hi.

02:51.772 --> 02:54.274
- Moppa.
- I need to be
air-lifted to Cedars.

02:54.274 --> 02:55.976
I will get your ass
to Cedars.

02:55.976 --> 02:57.244
- Hi.
- Hello, George.

02:57.244 --> 02:58.445
- Stat.
- Hi.

02:58.445 --> 02:59.613
Have you
made a BM yet?

02:59.613 --> 03:01.114
Good morning.

03:01.114 --> 03:02.816
You got to tell Sharita

03:02.816 --> 03:06.119
when you want
to make a BM, okay?

03:06.119 --> 03:08.722
Oh, my God,
that's disgusting.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.190
It is nuts in here.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.125
I'd like to solve
the puzzle, please.

03:12.125 --> 03:14.962
"Mother told me there'd
be days like this."

03:14.962 --> 03:16.163
That's it.

03:17.464 --> 03:18.566
You've got to get me
out of here.

03:18.566 --> 03:19.967
Mr. Pfefferman.

03:19.967 --> 03:22.235
I will take you
right now. Let's go.

03:22.235 --> 03:24.404
How are you feeling?

03:24.404 --> 03:25.606
It's Mrs.

03:25.606 --> 03:27.274
My name is Maura Pfefferman.

03:27.274 --> 03:28.642
- Hmm?
- She's a woman.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.043
- She's trans. That's wrong.
- Excuse me.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.312
Everything on this
board is wrong, dude.

03:32.312 --> 03:33.380
Just so you know.

03:33.380 --> 03:34.882
I want to put in
a request for--

03:34.882 --> 03:36.383
There's
a Dr. Harris J. Kunitz

03:36.383 --> 03:37.818
at Cedars Sinai,

03:37.818 --> 03:40.087
and I'd like him
brought in on this case.

03:40.087 --> 03:41.722
You're going to be
released today.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.423
- What?
- Are you sure?

03:43.423 --> 03:44.625
I mean,
what happened?

03:44.625 --> 03:45.926
- All his vitals are fine.
- Her vitals.

03:45.926 --> 03:48.195
- Her vitals. Her.
- Her.

03:48.195 --> 03:49.597
Just wait for the nurse

03:49.597 --> 03:51.599
to come in with
your release paperwork.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.135
What kind of douche-bag
doctor is that?

03:55.135 --> 03:56.604
You know what? I'm going
to go do the paperwork.

03:56.604 --> 03:59.006
This is what happens
when you go to a county.

03:59.006 --> 04:00.440
- And that one-- George--
Yeah.

04:00.440 --> 04:02.042
Has been farting
like it's his job.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.379
So are we--
are we good? Are we done?

04:06.379 --> 04:07.480
Farris?

04:07.480 --> 04:08.782
Bueller?

04:08.782 --> 04:09.983
Jesus Christ.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.151
Do you guys care
if I leave?

04:11.151 --> 04:12.753
Because I'm not
getting anything done,

04:12.753 --> 04:15.088
and I'm supposed
to go meet Raquel
at the temple.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.624
Um...

04:16.624 --> 04:18.225
how would you feel
if my new hobby

04:18.225 --> 04:20.027
was just hanging out
with Tammy all the time?

04:20.027 --> 04:22.429
Just like bro-ing out
with Tammy 24/7.

04:22.429 --> 04:23.631
I'd be good with that.

04:23.631 --> 04:25.098
She's done a lot of work
on herself,

04:25.098 --> 04:26.433
and you guys really enjoy
each other's company.

04:26.433 --> 04:27.835
I have to go and teach,
so are you--

04:27.835 --> 04:28.969
- Oh, he's fine.
- You're leaving?

04:28.969 --> 04:30.170
You have the ticket,
right, boss man?

04:30.170 --> 04:31.839
You can, like,
telecommute or something?

04:31.839 --> 04:34.642
Oh, no, I want to stay here
in this hellhole by myself.

04:34.642 --> 04:36.910
- Hey.
- Hi. Where is she?

04:36.910 --> 04:39.279
She's right down there.
She's fine.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.748
Okay. Thanks.

04:47.888 --> 04:51.491
"And when my husband
left me for another woman,

04:51.491 --> 04:53.160
"who would have ever thought

04:53.160 --> 04:56.529
"that the other woman
would be my husband?

04:56.529 --> 05:00.067
"No one, least of all me.

05:00.067 --> 05:05.706
"They say when one person
in a family transitions,

05:05.706 --> 05:08.141
"everyone transitions.

05:08.141 --> 05:11.144
And that could not
be more true."

05:15.148 --> 05:18.518
"The day I met
my b'sheret, myBuzzy,

05:18.518 --> 05:21.188
"right here in this very shul,

05:21.188 --> 05:25.025
"was the day that my new
life began to begin.

05:25.025 --> 05:29.863
"I have started to really live
the truth of my existence,

05:29.863 --> 05:33.366
"to really open up for
the first time in my life.

05:33.366 --> 05:38.872
"I have emerged from
the swamp pit of mishegoss.

05:38.872 --> 05:43.310
"Yes, I have been
to hell and back,

05:43.310 --> 05:49.349
or, dare I say,
to Shel and back."

05:51.618 --> 05:53.186
Thank you very much.

05:54.154 --> 05:56.489
- Just fantastic, Shelly.
- Thank you.

05:56.489 --> 05:57.825
Thank you so much.

05:57.825 --> 05:59.893
And when I came to,
she was gone.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.261
I never saw her again.

06:01.261 --> 06:02.996
I have no idea
what's happened to her.

06:02.996 --> 06:05.165
I'm very worried about her,
and I think...

06:05.165 --> 06:07.100
I mean, I may not
have helped this girl.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.002
Would you do me
a favor next time?

06:09.002 --> 06:11.371
Call me before you go
running all over town.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.206
Do you want to be
my emergency contact?

06:13.206 --> 06:15.008
- Yes.
- Yeah?

06:15.008 --> 06:16.844
You have to fill out a form.

06:16.844 --> 06:18.511
- Oh, a form?
- Yeah.

06:18.511 --> 06:19.780
Well, that's different.

06:22.349 --> 06:24.752
Oh, my God, you have
such a great face.

06:25.652 --> 06:27.320
You could
live your whole life

06:27.320 --> 06:28.588
hoping for a great face

06:28.588 --> 06:29.890
and eyes like that

06:29.890 --> 06:31.992
just staring into you
on your deathbed.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.861
You're so dramatic.

06:33.861 --> 06:35.195
I thought I was dying.

06:35.195 --> 06:36.830
I swear to God I--

06:36.830 --> 06:38.231
But you're not.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.970
But I'm not living.

06:44.271 --> 06:49.009
Yeah. I am not doing
the things I could be doing.

06:50.643 --> 06:53.080
And I do not want to die

06:53.080 --> 06:56.884
with some arrogant asshole
calling me Mr. Pfefferman.

07:04.324 --> 07:06.093
Baby, baby, what?

07:07.527 --> 07:09.897
I was so scared.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.966
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

07:20.640 --> 07:22.342
The main thing
the restructure will do

07:22.342 --> 07:24.144
is allow you to raise
money from investors

07:24.144 --> 07:25.712
without having
to make them partners.

07:25.712 --> 07:28.248
Right. Yeah.
And then, by combining
the sales and marketing,

07:28.248 --> 07:29.917
we're trimming
the bottom line.

07:29.917 --> 07:31.584
That's going to make
the whole package
that much more attractive.

07:31.584 --> 07:33.086
- Right.
- Right on.

07:33.086 --> 07:35.823
I'm also reaching out
to our social guys

07:35.823 --> 07:37.524
to discuss
mobile integration,

07:37.524 --> 07:40.861
get the Snapchatters
to fuck the periscopers,

07:40.861 --> 07:42.830
- et cetera, et cetera.
- Yes. Yes.

07:42.830 --> 07:43.931
Love--
Yes, I love all that.

07:43.931 --> 07:45.298
- Hold it.
- Exactly.

07:45.298 --> 07:48.501
Hey, Joshie, he's kind of
like the new you, right?

07:50.904 --> 07:53.206
And I'm the old him.

07:53.206 --> 07:56.009
He's come for your soul, man.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.847
Um, all right, guys.

07:59.847 --> 08:02.115
Well, uh, we did it.

08:02.115 --> 08:03.416
- We did it.
- We just had a meeting.

08:03.416 --> 08:05.018
- We did it, right?
- We did that.

08:05.018 --> 08:07.354
Congratulations.
We popped their cherry.

08:07.354 --> 08:10.157
All right, man. Well,
return my email, all right?

08:12.860 --> 08:13.861
That went great.

08:15.896 --> 08:17.865
You're so sweet.
Thank you so much.

08:17.865 --> 08:19.699
- And good shul.
- Yes.

08:19.699 --> 08:20.934
Hey, Mom.

08:20.934 --> 08:23.937
Oh, hi. You--
You missed my temple talk.

08:23.937 --> 08:25.172
It absolutely killed.

08:25.172 --> 08:27.007
- Did Ali text you?
- About what?

08:27.007 --> 08:29.176
Moppa.
She's in the hospital.

08:29.176 --> 08:31.378
What-- Gotinyu,
what's the matter?

08:31.378 --> 08:33.746
I don't know. I mean, I think
maybe anxiety. I'm not sure.

08:33.746 --> 08:36.649
But she's fine. I mean,
I think she's almost
about to be released.

08:36.649 --> 08:37.684
Everything's fine.

08:37.684 --> 08:39.887
This is why we need the group
thread on the phone.

08:39.887 --> 08:41.188
How do we set that up?

08:41.188 --> 08:42.555
Let's not worry
about that, okay?

08:42.555 --> 08:43.991
I'm in a hurry.
I have to--

08:43.991 --> 08:45.525
I have to
meet with the board.
I might be joining.

08:45.525 --> 08:48.395
Oh, well, that's terrific.
And you look very nice.

08:48.395 --> 08:50.163
And tell them that you're
family, that you're connected.

08:50.163 --> 08:51.932
You know,
Buzzy's on the board,

08:51.932 --> 08:53.200
And you're going
to be wonderful.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.467
- They're going to love you.
- Okay. Thanks.

08:54.467 --> 08:55.535
- You look fabulous.
- Thanks, Mom.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.603
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

08:56.603 --> 08:57.905
- My girl.
- All right. See you later.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.006
Hi, Mrs. Maitland.

09:03.977 --> 09:07.680
Oh, my God,
there he is. Duvid.

09:07.680 --> 09:08.748
Hi.

09:08.748 --> 09:10.017
I was just coming to find you.

09:10.017 --> 09:12.485
Oh. Such a long time.
How's-- Look at you.

09:12.485 --> 09:13.420
You look exactly the same.

09:13.420 --> 09:14.922
You look
exactly the same.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.656
No, I do not.

09:16.656 --> 09:18.458
It's been so long.

09:18.458 --> 09:19.927
You have a daughter.

09:19.927 --> 09:20.994
I do.

09:20.994 --> 09:22.462
What is happening?

09:22.462 --> 09:23.563
What is her name?

09:23.563 --> 09:24.364
Uh, Idit.

09:24.364 --> 09:25.832
- Edith.
- Uh, Idit.

09:25.832 --> 09:26.967
Idit'.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.235
No, the final T
is pronounced T-H.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.469
- Oh, I see.
- Idit.

09:29.469 --> 09:32.339
I just-- Uh, does she
like LA so far?

09:32.339 --> 09:34.007
She does. it's a good
change for her.

09:34.007 --> 09:36.176
Her mother passed away
a few years ago, so--

09:36.176 --> 09:37.277
Wait.

09:37.277 --> 09:38.545
What?

09:39.947 --> 09:41.748
Wait, Duvid. Come here.

09:41.748 --> 09:44.151
- Oh, my God.
- Yes.

09:44.151 --> 09:48.421
I'm so sorry. I just assumed
that she was with you.

09:48.421 --> 09:51.824
No. Unfortunately,
Bathsheba had a heart murmur

09:51.824 --> 09:53.060
that went undiagnosed, and--

09:53.060 --> 09:55.195
- But-- But you--
- Oh, my God.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.629
You. I want
to hear about you.

09:56.629 --> 09:57.797
Do you have kids?

09:57.797 --> 09:59.199
Uh, no. Mm-mm.

09:59.199 --> 10:01.368
I was with somebody,
and we got close,

10:01.368 --> 10:03.103
- but--
- Sorry. I'm sorry I'm late.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.304
- I--
- Sarah, hi.

10:04.304 --> 10:05.705
- Hi.
- No. Uh-uh. This is, uh--

10:05.705 --> 10:08.075
Sarah Pfefferman.
She's joining the temple.

10:08.075 --> 10:09.209
She's meeting
the board today.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.611
She's got all sorts
of great ideas

10:11.611 --> 10:12.879
for new programs.

10:12.879 --> 10:14.181
This is Duvid.
He's our new cantor.

10:14.181 --> 10:15.415
I know who this is.

10:15.415 --> 10:17.217
I saw your picture
in the newsletter.

10:17.217 --> 10:18.551
We're so happy
to have you.

10:18.551 --> 10:19.819
I'm happy to be here.

10:19.819 --> 10:21.221
It was time
for a change.

10:21.221 --> 10:22.255
Right?

10:22.255 --> 10:24.191
I will let you
to your meeting.

10:24.191 --> 10:25.525
Oh. it's so good
to see you.

10:25.525 --> 10:27.794
Oh, my God. I--
I want to talk, too.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.062
To be continued.

10:29.062 --> 10:30.263
Very good
to see you.

10:30.263 --> 10:31.731
You, too.
Nice meeting you, Sarah.

10:31.731 --> 10:33.200
You, too.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.735
We went to seminary
together.

10:35.735 --> 10:37.870
Really? Hot.

10:37.870 --> 10:39.572
Sarah, his wife
passed away.

10:39.572 --> 10:41.841
- That's perfect.
- Sarah Pfefferman!

10:41.841 --> 10:43.876
How is your moppa?

10:43.876 --> 10:45.778
Oh, God, she's fine.
She's totally fine.

10:45.778 --> 10:47.547
But you know where they took
her? They took her to County.

10:47.547 --> 10:49.816
- Was Josh there?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:49.816 --> 10:50.883
- We were all there.
- Yeah?

10:50.883 --> 10:52.185
He's got a stick
up his butt

10:52.185 --> 10:53.820
about me joining
the board, by the way.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.922
- Aw.
- Yeah, well, whatever.

10:55.922 --> 10:57.590
I mean, he just
likes to suffer.

10:57.590 --> 10:58.758
You know how he is.

10:58.758 --> 11:01.294
Hmm. Right. Is he suffering?

11:01.294 --> 11:03.096
Always. So anyway,
is there something

11:03.096 --> 11:04.464
that you need me
to, like, do

11:04.464 --> 11:06.699
to get the board, you know,
to approve me? Like--

11:06.699 --> 11:09.536
Honey, this
is just a total formality.

11:09.536 --> 11:11.038
- Are you sure?
- It's just a li--

11:11.038 --> 11:12.472
You'll be great.
You're going to do great.

11:12.472 --> 11:14.174
- Okay.
- You're going to do so fine.

11:14.174 --> 11:15.675
All right. I'm nervous.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.144
Oh, shh.

11:20.647 --> 11:22.782
Berlin between
the two world wars

11:22.782 --> 11:25.518
was a much freer place
than America is today.

11:25.518 --> 11:28.521
They called these
free people asocials.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.723
How many of you have
had the ominous feeling

11:30.723 --> 11:34.361
that your very essence
is taboo to those around you?

11:34.361 --> 11:36.196
Maybe you felt
the need to escape.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.498
So the Jewish people
have this escape legacy.

11:38.498 --> 11:40.133
But you don't
have to be Jewish

11:40.133 --> 11:42.669
to feel like you're running
from something, right?

11:42.669 --> 11:44.471
I mean, many people
move through the world

11:44.471 --> 11:47.340
with the sense that they're
being, uh, chased.

11:47.340 --> 11:50.643
It could be your email inbox
or a sense of dread.

11:50.643 --> 11:52.545
Okay. Uh, that's it.

11:52.545 --> 11:55.548
You guys, you know what you're
reading for the long weekend,

11:55.548 --> 11:57.084
and I will be looking forward

11:57.084 --> 11:58.585
to seeing what you
come up with.

11:58.585 --> 12:00.853
So "e" me if you
have any questions.

12:00.853 --> 12:02.122
Thank you.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.391
Bye.

12:04.391 --> 12:06.093
Bye.

12:06.093 --> 12:07.794
Have a good weekend.

12:07.794 --> 12:08.761
Bye.

12:10.197 --> 12:13.500
Man, you look real cute
leading a section,

12:13.500 --> 12:17.003
all bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed.

12:17.003 --> 12:18.705
This is so fun. I love this.

12:18.705 --> 12:21.108
Swimming around
in all these ideas.

12:21.108 --> 12:24.111
- Uhh!
- Ooh, swimming.

12:32.018 --> 12:35.522
I think you might
be my favorite kisser.

12:35.522 --> 12:37.157
Of all time?

12:40.493 --> 12:44.164
Hey, which of the readings
were you teaching on just now?

12:44.164 --> 12:47.300
Oh, I was doing a thing
on historical memory

12:47.300 --> 12:49.369
and feminist dystopia.

12:49.369 --> 12:51.671
Okey-dokey.
I'm not quite sure

12:51.671 --> 12:53.473
what that has to do
with the Holocaust.

12:53.473 --> 12:55.142
Well, I'm just--
I'm trying

12:55.142 --> 12:56.509
to create a dynamic
with the students

12:56.509 --> 12:59.146
where I'm not, like,
Teacher with a capital T.

12:59.146 --> 13:00.513
- Hmm.
- I'm riffing.

13:00.513 --> 13:02.515
Ahem. Well, I always say
that there is a difference

13:02.515 --> 13:05.352
between thinking
and overthinking.

13:05.352 --> 13:07.754
- Oh, do you?
- Mm-hmm.

13:07.754 --> 13:09.189
I'm hungry.

13:09.189 --> 13:10.690
Coffee cart?

13:10.690 --> 13:12.159
Yeah.

13:12.159 --> 13:15.495
Uh, but if you don't mind,
let's walk out separately.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.230
- I don't need those kids--
- Right.

13:17.230 --> 13:18.765
...clucking about my sex life.

13:41.221 --> 13:42.355
Knock, knock, knock.

13:42.355 --> 13:43.790
What's up, Junior?

13:43.790 --> 13:44.791
Hey.

13:46.193 --> 13:47.394
Uh...

13:47.394 --> 13:49.962
have you checked out
the drop box link

13:49.962 --> 13:51.231
for that Manatee EP?

13:51.231 --> 13:53.233
No, I did not.

13:53.233 --> 13:54.401
They're out of Omaha.

13:54.401 --> 13:57.570
Kind of like punk moog.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.239
- Like 'em?
- Yeah.

13:59.239 --> 14:00.640
First time I heard them play,

14:00.640 --> 14:03.610
I was actually like, "This
is how Josh must have felt

14:03.610 --> 14:07.013
the first time he heard
Fussypuss play together." So--

14:07.013 --> 14:08.415
How did I feel?

14:08.415 --> 14:11.818
Just like heart emoji,
dollar emoji.

14:11.818 --> 14:13.286
Okay, sign them.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.622
Are you serious?

14:15.622 --> 14:17.424
Yeah.

14:17.424 --> 14:20.660
Do you want to listen
to them or--

14:20.660 --> 14:23.496
I-- I don't--
I don't want to hear them.

14:24.897 --> 14:26.266
Oh. Okay.

14:27.967 --> 14:29.469
Smiley emoj--

14:30.437 --> 14:32.239
I was going to say
smiley emoji,

14:32.239 --> 14:33.606
but it's a lame joke.

14:33.606 --> 14:35.242
- Close the door.
- Yeah.

14:37.444 --> 14:39.412
Closed door emoji.

15:05.772 --> 15:06.939
You good, Josh?

15:08.608 --> 15:10.343
- You good?
- Um...

15:10.343 --> 15:12.044
I'm going to work
from home.

15:12.044 --> 15:13.613
Okay. See you later.

15:13.613 --> 15:14.581
Okay.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.828
So I'm thinking
if you want to keep
them at the temple,

15:28.828 --> 15:30.430
you roll them out
whenever you need them.

15:30.430 --> 15:31.931
- What are they?
- It's like a beanbag,

15:31.931 --> 15:33.300
but it's filled with air.

15:33.300 --> 15:34.767
We could have a hundred
of them at the temple

15:34.767 --> 15:36.469
that we pull out
when we want to do, like,

15:36.469 --> 15:38.505
you know, Havdalah
at the park

15:38.505 --> 15:40.139
or a Shabbat at the beach.

15:40.139 --> 15:41.574
I don't want
to offend you in any way,

15:41.574 --> 15:42.842
but I'm just worried
they might be a little bit--

15:42.842 --> 15:44.210
- Hi.
- Do you know Sarah?

15:44.210 --> 15:45.712
Sarah Pfefferman.
So nice to see you.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.380
- Nice to see you again.
- Thank you for having me.

15:47.380 --> 15:48.748
Do you want coffee
or anything?

15:48.748 --> 15:50.550
I'm going to get some
after I start my mailing.

15:50.550 --> 15:52.385
Okay. So I'm just going
to have you hold onto it.

15:52.385 --> 15:53.986
I just don't know
if they're right for us.

15:53.986 --> 15:56.055
- Well, I bought them already.
- Did you save a receipt?

15:56.055 --> 15:57.357
- Uh--
- Sandy.

15:57.357 --> 15:59.459
- Hi.
- Mrs. Carry Over Mats!

15:59.459 --> 16:01.928
Do you remember I talked
to you about Sarah?

16:01.928 --> 16:03.229
- Hi.
- Hi. Oh, Sarah.

16:03.229 --> 16:04.531
- Sarah Pfefferman.
- Okay.

16:04.531 --> 16:06.232
- I love these mats.
- This is what it's like.

16:06.232 --> 16:07.567
It's just colorful,
whimsical.

16:07.567 --> 16:08.835
I'm sorry.
I'm trying to--

16:08.835 --> 16:10.337
It's okay. I'm just
going to put them down.

16:10.337 --> 16:12.104
Oh, right. Yeah.
Do you need a--

16:12.104 --> 16:13.172
No, I'm good.

16:13.172 --> 16:15.408
Oh, good.
It's already started.

16:15.408 --> 16:17.644
I told you it was going
to be casual. Right?

16:17.644 --> 16:18.778
Hi, Mary.

16:18.778 --> 16:20.347
- Do you want some coffee?
- Uh, yes, thank you.

16:20.347 --> 16:21.848
Good. Are you okay?
Do you need anything?

16:21.848 --> 16:23.583
I'm totally fine.
Fine, fine, fine.

16:23.583 --> 16:26.519
I really want to talk
about Raquel's world here

16:26.519 --> 16:29.055
and what I feel
like I can bring to that,

16:29.055 --> 16:32.392
you know, which would be
a certain, uh, inclusivity.

16:32.392 --> 16:33.793
- Yes. Yes.
- Inclusivity.

16:33.793 --> 16:37.630
That's sort of the same
thing as diversity, right?

16:37.630 --> 16:39.131
Uh, I think
they're related.

16:39.131 --> 16:40.967
- Yeah. Sure.
- You can't have one
without the other.

16:40.967 --> 16:42.469
Nothing wrong
with diversity.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.036
Uh, anyway, I have
really close ties

16:44.036 --> 16:45.672
to the LGBT community.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.640
Oh, every time
I hear that,

16:47.640 --> 16:49.876
it makes me so hungry
for a BLT.

16:49.876 --> 16:50.877
Is that so wrong?

16:50.877 --> 16:53.413
Equal rights for
lettuce and tomato!

16:54.547 --> 16:57.116
That's, uh, so funny.

16:57.116 --> 17:00.587
Anyway, I say this because
I have a trans parent,

17:00.587 --> 17:02.989
and, uh, I mean, I feel
like the, you know,

17:02.989 --> 17:05.124
L and the G are
pretty well assimilated,

17:05.124 --> 17:07.560
but B and T never
really get their due,

17:07.560 --> 17:10.463
you know, and I actually
personally am, uh,

17:10.463 --> 17:12.965
identifying,
uh, vigorously

17:12.965 --> 17:14.667
and vociferously

17:14.667 --> 17:15.568
as bi.

17:15.568 --> 17:17.737
- Oh, wow.
- I'm just so curious.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.439
This is important.
Why didn't you want
to bring this up

17:19.439 --> 17:20.740
during our session
we had?

17:20.740 --> 17:22.475
Oh, have you guys
met before?

17:22.475 --> 17:24.644
Well, she's
a life coaching
client of mine.

17:24.644 --> 17:25.978
- Really?
- Actually, I'm not a client.

17:25.978 --> 17:27.313
- Sarah, you never told me this.
- Yes.

17:27.313 --> 17:28.681
She had a full
appointment.

17:28.681 --> 17:30.417
- I'm not a client.
- Well, that's great.

17:30.417 --> 17:31.584
A client for,
like, one session.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.553
Let's move over
to the table, everyone.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.087
Tammy. It was the Tammy time.

17:35.087 --> 17:36.322
I was trying
to tell you.

17:36.322 --> 17:37.690
But I'm actually living
with my husband--

17:37.690 --> 17:39.559
my ex-husband, so,

17:39.559 --> 17:40.993
I mean, that works out
fantastically.

17:40.993 --> 17:43.430
You know, we get to be with
the kids and have a family

17:43.430 --> 17:44.664
and, you know be together.

17:44.664 --> 17:46.198
And, I mean, we get
our needs met elsewhere

17:46.198 --> 17:48.735
because I can't possibly
keep up with his needs.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.503
I mean-- He has
this girlfriend.

17:50.503 --> 17:51.904
She's millennial, right?

17:51.904 --> 17:53.440
I mean, they're a monster
that we created.

17:53.440 --> 17:54.774
Let's be honest.
We created the internet.

17:54.774 --> 17:56.008
They were basically
raised on porn.

17:56.008 --> 17:57.677
I don't know.
It's like Jurassic Park,

17:57.677 --> 18:00.012
when they came out of the egg
and the mouth was open,

18:00.012 --> 18:02.348
you know, just, like,
ready to suck cock all day.

18:02.348 --> 18:04.617
I swear, I mean, they're
like gobble, gobble, gobble.

18:04.617 --> 18:07.086
So why doesn't everybody
just gather around the table?

18:07.086 --> 18:08.888
Uh, sign in.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.759
But I really am
committed to my family.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.293
None of this
would be a problem

18:14.293 --> 18:16.763
if there was
a wider understanding
of intersectionality,

18:16.763 --> 18:18.364
but the word has
too many syllables:

18:18.364 --> 18:19.932
in-ter-sec-tion--

18:19.932 --> 18:21.834
I'm bored. I'm not
even finishing it.

18:21.834 --> 18:24.837
I admit that I avoid
investigating
authors of color

18:24.837 --> 18:27.474
because I'm afraid that I'm
going to get in trouble.

18:27.474 --> 18:29.476
That's your white
fragility talking.

18:29.476 --> 18:30.510
What's that?

18:30.510 --> 18:32.044
It's when people think

18:32.044 --> 18:34.046
their white tears matter
more than black blood.

18:34.046 --> 18:36.683
That's not at all
what I meant.

18:36.683 --> 18:38.050
That's what it is,
straight up.

18:38.050 --> 18:39.952
- Then that's not what I have.
- Okay.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.821
You know, that's why
Caroline dropped out.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.790
She did that
Zora Neal Hurston piece,

18:43.790 --> 18:45.492
and she just got
totally called out

18:45.492 --> 18:47.494
- by the women of color.
- Come on.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.496
She left because
she was fucking Leslie.

18:49.496 --> 18:51.163
Yes. That's what happened.

18:51.163 --> 18:52.832
- I know.
- She was fucking Leslie?

18:52.832 --> 18:54.000
Oh, yeah.
Every semester,

18:54.000 --> 18:55.502
Leslie picks
someone new to fuck:

18:55.502 --> 18:57.169
a blonde, a brunette,
an Asian, whatever.

18:57.169 --> 18:58.538
She loves them all.

18:58.538 --> 19:03.510
Ooh, guys, guess what
Leslie keeps in her desk.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.245
Testosterone cream.

19:06.245 --> 19:08.180
For menopause?

19:08.180 --> 19:09.982
More like sex drive.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.918
It turns your clit
into a strobe light.

19:11.918 --> 19:13.986
Like, ten orgasms
in one night.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.855
Oh, no, no, no.
That's too many.

19:15.855 --> 19:16.856
- Too many?
- Yeah, too many.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.190
What, do you hate yourself?

19:18.190 --> 19:20.059
No, I don't hate myself.
That's just too many.

19:20.059 --> 19:22.529
What do you have to do
that's better than coming?

19:22.529 --> 19:24.731
I don't know.
Grocery shop.

19:24.731 --> 19:26.666
Pearl, we should jet and get
to the Farmer's Market

19:26.666 --> 19:28.200
before it closes.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.536
You don't want to get stuck

19:29.536 --> 19:31.337
with that sad Charlie Brown
Christmas kale.

19:31.337 --> 19:32.739
You guys coming?

19:32.739 --> 19:33.773
Uh, no,
I still got work to do.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.341
- Thank you, guys.
- Bye, guys.

19:35.341 --> 19:36.776
- Bye.
- Bye, guys.

19:42.348 --> 19:44.551
I just got another email

19:44.551 --> 19:46.118
from one of the women
at temple.

19:46.118 --> 19:50.156
Listen to this.
"You're a natural,

19:50.156 --> 19:52.358
like Streisand."

19:52.358 --> 19:54.426
Oh! That is the third email

19:54.426 --> 19:56.563
I have gotten
about my performance.

19:56.563 --> 19:58.865
Babe, you're
becoming a thing.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.633
There are so many
women out there

20:00.633 --> 20:02.101
who see themselves in me.

20:04.737 --> 20:07.740
Thousands and thousands
of mes out there

20:07.740 --> 20:09.842
who need a voice. I mean,

20:09.842 --> 20:13.780
maybe I could be the voice
of all those mes.

20:13.780 --> 20:15.047
Maybe"To Shel and Back"

20:15.047 --> 20:17.049
isn't just a one-time
temple talk.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.885
Wait. I'm loving this.
Keep going.

20:18.885 --> 20:21.120
Maybe it's a real
one-woman show.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.389
I-- I-- I--
Me telling my story.

20:23.389 --> 20:24.924
I write it, I perform it.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.458
Do you sing?

20:26.458 --> 20:27.960
No, I don't sing.

20:27.960 --> 20:28.928
Don't worry.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.930
I used to sing.
Now I don't sing.

20:36.035 --> 20:40.106
* Touch me in the morning *

20:40.106 --> 20:41.941
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop. Stop.

20:41.941 --> 20:44.844
I think-- I think
a nightingale

20:44.844 --> 20:46.478
somehow
flew into the room.

20:46.478 --> 20:47.647
Stop!

20:53.285 --> 20:57.323
* Then just walk away *

20:57.323 --> 20:59.491
You do sing.
That's not fair.

20:59.491 --> 21:02.228
The face and the bod
and the humor,

21:02.228 --> 21:03.630
and you sing also?

21:03.630 --> 21:05.031
You know, when I was
in college,

21:05.031 --> 21:07.199
I produced all
the campus events.

21:07.199 --> 21:08.500
I can do a score.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.069
You write music?

21:10.069 --> 21:11.070
Yeah. Sure.

21:11.070 --> 21:14.641
Oh, my God. You could
produce my show.

21:14.641 --> 21:16.208
I just think
that religious events

21:16.208 --> 21:18.110
should be as interesting
as secular events.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.713
I mean, how hard is it
to make a cute flyer?

21:20.713 --> 21:21.748
Shut up, slut.

21:21.748 --> 21:23.249
I'm sorry.

21:25.652 --> 21:26.786
I don't know. You know,

21:26.786 --> 21:28.354
there's this whole
Jewish concept, though,

21:28.354 --> 21:29.889
that if you do volunteer work

21:29.889 --> 21:31.457
you're not supposed
to tell anyone about it

21:31.457 --> 21:33.760
because if you tell anyone,
it just voids the work.

21:33.760 --> 21:37.664
It's more about, you know,
ego than charity.

21:37.664 --> 21:40.099
It's so pathetic. Actually,
if you think about that,

21:40.099 --> 21:41.668
like, if that's actually true,

21:41.668 --> 21:43.703
then I haven't done
a single charitable act

21:43.703 --> 21:45.371
my entire life.

21:45.371 --> 21:47.807
Sarah,

21:47.807 --> 21:49.742
if you want to come,
you have to focus.

21:49.742 --> 21:51.443
Right. Okay.

21:51.443 --> 21:53.512
You know what? Actually,
I'm good. I'm totally good.

21:53.512 --> 21:55.982
I'll just charitably pay you
for the last 15 minutes,

21:55.982 --> 21:58.350
and, you know, you don't
have to beat me.

21:58.350 --> 22:02.121
It'll be a little free time,
a little free time for you.

22:02.121 --> 22:04.691
Whatever you want to do,
just don't worry.

22:04.691 --> 22:06.158
It's on me.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.593
I thought you weren't
supposed to say anything

22:07.593 --> 22:08.928
when you do it for charity.

22:13.565 --> 22:14.834
Don't be mad at me.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.368
I'm only late
because of Google Maps.

22:16.368 --> 22:17.503
They kept sending me

22:17.503 --> 22:19.138
from one totally
fucked parking lot

22:19.138 --> 22:21.373
to another fucked parking lot.

22:21.373 --> 22:23.509
Nobody uses that anymore.

22:23.509 --> 22:24.711
Well, what do they use?

22:24.711 --> 22:25.945
They use Waze now.

22:25.945 --> 22:27.947
Oh, fuck, that's right.

22:29.281 --> 22:31.417
Oh, yeah.

22:31.417 --> 22:33.419
Worship that cock.

22:35.321 --> 22:39.225
So what's your deal?
Are you, uh, dating anyone?

22:39.225 --> 22:40.459
No, not really.

22:40.459 --> 22:43.763
Not really? Who are you
having sex with not really?

22:43.763 --> 22:46.098
No one. Not right now.

22:51.971 --> 22:54.941
You're doing that?

22:54.941 --> 22:57.143
Yeah. Just to try.

22:59.979 --> 23:01.180
Ohh.

23:02.281 --> 23:03.349
Try some.

23:04.751 --> 23:05.918
Put it on.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.357
Is it working?

23:12.759 --> 23:15.127
Ahh. Is it working for you?

23:17.429 --> 23:18.765
Mm.

23:19.766 --> 23:22.334
It's not not working.

23:22.334 --> 23:23.669
Yeah?

23:23.669 --> 23:26.072
I'm kind of getting
turned on.

23:27.473 --> 23:28.941
Uhh.

23:31.210 --> 23:32.845
Feel how wet I am.

23:37.049 --> 23:39.285
- Ohh.
- Is that a cream? What--

23:39.285 --> 23:40.319
Ah!

23:41.520 --> 23:43.155
Aah!

23:43.155 --> 23:45.224
Aah!

23:45.224 --> 23:47.359
Ohh!

23:56.668 --> 23:58.637
Cool.

23:58.637 --> 24:00.106
Thanks.

24:01.340 --> 24:03.109
That was fun.

24:03.109 --> 24:05.812
Ah. I'll see you
tomorrow.

24:05.812 --> 24:07.479
Whew.

24:07.479 --> 24:08.547
Bye.

24:14.553 --> 24:16.856
- Maura?
- Hold on.

24:16.856 --> 24:19.291
- Hon?
- Hold on!

24:19.291 --> 24:20.392
All right.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.231
- Hi.
- Listen, I am really sorry

24:25.231 --> 24:26.833
that I didn't make it
to the hospital.

24:26.833 --> 24:28.200
Oh, that's fine.

24:28.200 --> 24:30.336
I just assumed that Vicki
would drop everything and--

24:30.336 --> 24:31.838
- Yeah, she came.
- ...come over.

24:31.838 --> 24:33.005
- Yeah.
- How are you?

24:33.005 --> 24:34.841
Honestly? Not great.

24:34.841 --> 24:37.476
Uh, I fell, so they're
taking all these tests,

24:37.476 --> 24:39.411
and I'm, you know,
I'm not in great shape.

24:39.411 --> 24:41.513
I never exercise,
and I smoke too much,

24:41.513 --> 24:42.714
and I know that.

24:42.714 --> 24:44.116
I feel-- Something's off.

24:44.116 --> 24:46.285
Okay. Can I say
something to you?

24:46.285 --> 24:48.855
You've got to listen
to your body.

24:50.322 --> 24:54.093
M-My body and I haven't
really been talking.

24:56.095 --> 24:58.697
Yoshi! Mama moto!

24:58.697 --> 24:59.932
Gator.

24:59.932 --> 25:02.334
- Yanni.
- Gator, gator, gator.

25:02.334 --> 25:03.302
Hi.

25:03.302 --> 25:05.371
Something is happening
on the grill.

25:05.371 --> 25:06.973
What is happening?

25:06.973 --> 25:08.374
Someone crazy here

25:08.374 --> 25:11.343
is making, uh,
breakfast for supper.

25:11.343 --> 25:13.379
Oh, breakfast for supper.
You maniac.

25:13.379 --> 25:16.015
Fucking
lunatic fringe over here.

25:16.015 --> 25:18.350
That is just
outrageous.

25:18.350 --> 25:21.220
It's insane, and yet
here I am doing it.

25:21.220 --> 25:23.956
Ohh! Should we
have wine or beer?

25:23.956 --> 25:25.191
- Uh...
- I need to drink a lot.

25:25.191 --> 25:28.294
...maybe a wine,
like a cab.

25:28.294 --> 25:29.195
Cabbie?

25:29.195 --> 25:30.930
Yeah, like a big cab, maybe.

25:30.930 --> 25:32.564
How big cab?

25:32.564 --> 25:33.732
Um, you know what?

25:33.732 --> 25:35.167
You've been
working so hard.

25:35.167 --> 25:38.170
I think you've
earned a barolo.

25:38.170 --> 25:40.907
You know what?
You're damn right I have.

25:40.907 --> 25:42.041
Deservsies?

25:42.041 --> 25:44.243
I deservsies this.
Let me tell you why.

25:44.243 --> 25:47.079
This AirBnB thing
is fucking killing me.

25:47.079 --> 25:49.315
I mean, the cash is good,

25:49.315 --> 25:51.050
but these people,
they're Nazis.

25:51.050 --> 25:54.086
They want everything
to be clean each time.

25:54.086 --> 25:56.122
Like you have
to wash the towels

25:56.122 --> 25:58.624
every time somebody checks in,
and the sheets.

25:58.624 --> 26:01.527
And you've got to dust. I mean,
it's a full-time fucking job.

26:01.527 --> 26:02.728
I may have to up the price.

26:02.728 --> 26:04.763
The fucking monsters.

26:04.763 --> 26:05.932
Give me a fucking break.

26:05.932 --> 26:07.934
That's right.

26:07.934 --> 26:10.136
Mm. Mm-mm. No,
I need sweatsies.

26:10.136 --> 26:12.104
All right. I'll load it up.

26:13.072 --> 26:15.574
Eh, Lucy,
I'm home.

26:15.574 --> 26:17.743
- Daddy!
- Daddy's home!

26:17.743 --> 26:19.245
Hey! Hey.

26:19.245 --> 26:20.779
Daddy,
where have you been?

26:20.779 --> 26:22.281
- Whaah!
- I've been at work.

26:22.281 --> 26:24.050
What are we doing
for dinner?

26:24.050 --> 26:25.851
Oh, check it out.

26:25.851 --> 26:27.853
Oh, this is legit.

26:27.853 --> 26:29.488
Is this a zucchini
blossom?

26:29.488 --> 26:31.958
- It is.
- This is a fucking
zucchini blossom?

26:31.958 --> 26:33.259
It's not bad, right?

26:33.259 --> 26:35.227
What have you done
with my ex-wife?

26:35.227 --> 26:38.130
Here. Honey,
would you give these out to--

26:38.130 --> 26:39.265
Yeah. Who wants
some salad?

26:39.265 --> 26:40.967
Try it at least.
Just try it.

26:40.967 --> 26:42.368
- Eww!
- Just try one bite of it.

26:42.368 --> 26:43.869
Definitely take
the Jenner side.

26:43.869 --> 26:45.137
Here's the kicker.

26:45.137 --> 26:47.306
She was 17 years old
in this picture.

26:47.306 --> 26:49.875
- Married, too.
- And she was married.

26:49.875 --> 26:51.110
- And--
- Kind of like--

26:51.110 --> 26:52.511
Kind of like me.

26:52.511 --> 26:55.081
I'd better not
hear that from you.

26:55.081 --> 26:56.548
Yes, yes, yes.

26:56.548 --> 26:59.351
I think I may have cheated
on my girlfriend today.

26:59.351 --> 27:02.354
I didn't realize
Leslie was officially
your girlfriend.

27:02.354 --> 27:05.291
Whatever she is, I cheated
on her by raping myself.

27:05.291 --> 27:08.027
Actually, I raped my hand
with some weird chick's vagina.

27:08.027 --> 27:09.628
I hate when that happens.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.763
- Up next...
- Has that happened to you?

27:11.763 --> 27:13.699
Oh. New "Shark Tank."

27:19.305 --> 27:21.040
Ah, this show's the best.

27:26.012 --> 27:29.015
**

27:30.849 --> 27:33.419
Oh, my God. Yoshi! "Battle"!

27:33.419 --> 27:34.286
What?

27:34.286 --> 27:35.321
Remember
when we were little

27:35.321 --> 27:37.023
and you wrote us that song?

27:37.023 --> 27:39.491
Our Honeymoon Sonata?

27:39.491 --> 27:40.559
Ready?

27:41.627 --> 27:43.195
**

27:48.134 --> 27:52.271
* When the battle is over *

27:52.271 --> 27:55.241
*And the tide
washes through *

27:55.241 --> 27:59.178
* We will run off together *

27:59.178 --> 28:01.547
* Me and you *

28:02.614 --> 28:06.285
* And I hope you'll remember *

28:06.285 --> 28:09.621
*Just to wait there for me *

28:09.621 --> 28:13.059
* And we'll run off together *

28:13.059 --> 28:15.927
* To the sea *

28:15.927 --> 28:19.531
*Oh, and I want you to know *

28:19.531 --> 28:23.535
*That our time
will be here soon *

28:23.535 --> 28:26.438
*We'll escape, far we'll go *

28:26.438 --> 28:30.209
*By the light
of the silvery moon *

28:30.209 --> 28:34.180
* When the battle is over *

28:34.180 --> 28:38.584
* And the tide
washes through *

28:38.584 --> 28:43.755
*We will run off together *

28:43.755 --> 28:47.859
* Me and you *

28:47.859 --> 28:54.500
* Me and you *
