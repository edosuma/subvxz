WEBVTT

00:03.655 --> 00:05.570
Isn't this nice?

00:05.614 --> 00:09.487
It feels good knowing the only
thing going on in our lives

00:09.531 --> 00:12.621
right now
is a new loose leaf tea kettle.

00:12.664 --> 00:14.318
After the year we had,

00:14.362 --> 00:16.494
I could get used to
these low-key days.

00:16.538 --> 00:18.670
I love you, F-F-F--

00:18.714 --> 00:21.847
Fire station open houses!

00:21.891 --> 00:25.155
Oh!

00:25.199 --> 00:26.678
Fire station open house,
Francine!

00:26.722 --> 00:27.505
C'mon! C'mon! C'mon!

00:30.726 --> 00:32.684
Aaaaaah!

00:32.728 --> 00:34.556
Where are you going?

00:37.559 --> 00:39.735

00:39.778 --> 00:43.869

01:07.197 --> 01:08.546
Good job.

01:08.590 --> 01:09.591
Put out that fire.

01:11.201 --> 01:12.463
I found the horn!

01:14.596 --> 01:16.293
Aw, man, these are great.

01:18.643 --> 01:21.559
So, we've gone over
some basic fire safety.

01:21.603 --> 01:22.821
Are there any questions?

01:22.865 --> 01:24.432
Why is fire so hot?

01:24.475 --> 01:26.347
Dumb. Dumb question.

01:26.390 --> 01:28.262
Uh, maybe because it's burning.

01:32.440 --> 01:35.399
Okay, folks, get
your raffle tickets out.

01:35.443 --> 01:37.401
Time to see who'll be Langley's

01:37.445 --> 01:39.925
- Honorary Firefighter!
- Wait, what did he say?

01:39.969 --> 01:42.667
The winner will get
to spend a week

01:42.711 --> 01:44.756
hanging with us, learning,

01:44.800 --> 01:48.891
and maybe even go
on the truck to a real fire.

01:48.934 --> 01:50.284
There's a raffle?

01:50.327 --> 01:51.372
But I didn't buy a ticket.

01:51.415 --> 01:53.243
31.

01:53.287 --> 01:54.766
Wait, please let this pancake
be my ticket.

01:54.810 --> 01:56.333
Who has 31?

01:56.377 --> 01:58.727
31?

01:58.770 --> 02:01.469
I think that's me.

02:01.512 --> 02:03.253
<i>WOMAN</i> <i>
Now that you've threaded</i>

02:03.297 --> 02:05.690
<i>your needle, you'll need</i> <i>
to bring the point down</i>

02:05.734 --> 02:07.257
<i>and through the canvas.</i>

02:07.301 --> 02:08.954
Down and --

02:08.998 --> 02:10.565
- Outta my way!
- Ow!

02:10.608 --> 02:11.522
What the hell?!

02:13.481 --> 02:15.831
Stan, you're really redefining

02:15.874 --> 02:18.268
the concept of "open kitchen."

02:19.922 --> 02:22.620
I will swallow you whole.

02:22.664 --> 02:25.797
Whoa, talk about
an open kitch--

02:25.841 --> 02:27.321
No, Hayley, don't!

02:29.497 --> 02:32.239
Why, Dad, why?!

02:32.282 --> 02:33.805
He's having a meltdown

02:33.849 --> 02:35.938
because I won some raffle

02:35.981 --> 02:38.201
to spend a week
with the Fire Department.

02:38.245 --> 02:39.855
I've always longed to be
a firefighter,

02:39.898 --> 02:41.509
and I was so close,

02:41.552 --> 02:44.990
until a certain sexy
little Benedict Arnold

02:45.034 --> 02:47.254
hypnotized me
with her long legs

02:47.297 --> 02:48.603
into forgetting
there was a raffle.

02:48.646 --> 02:50.213
Oh, grow up.

02:50.257 --> 02:52.607
You've been like this
since the day we got married.

02:52.650 --> 02:54.652
A highly sexual
and reasonable man?

02:54.696 --> 02:58.526
A man who overreacts
when he doesn't get his way.

02:58.569 --> 03:01.746
Oh, and I suppose you'd
call this an overreaction.

03:01.790 --> 03:02.747
Hayley, turn on the stove.

03:02.791 --> 03:04.880
Steve, time me.

03:04.923 --> 03:06.186
Fire!

03:07.839 --> 03:11.452
Can I just say that I have
a needle inside me?!

03:11.495 --> 03:13.715
Whoa!

03:13.758 --> 03:16.457
- Time.
- Enough, Stan.

03:16.500 --> 03:19.416
I'm obviously gonna give you
the raffle ticket.

03:19.460 --> 03:21.853
Do you mean it?
I get to go fire-manning?

03:21.897 --> 03:24.769
Yeah, Stan, I just hope
it makes you happy.

03:24.813 --> 03:27.511
Oh, it does, Francine.
It really does.

03:32.473 --> 03:34.388
Hey, thanks for
helping me present

03:34.431 --> 03:35.780
this environmental report.

03:35.824 --> 03:38.479
I-I get so nervous
speaking in public.

03:38.522 --> 03:40.568
No, thank you, Hayley.

03:40.611 --> 03:43.310
For showing me what's really
going on in this town.

03:43.353 --> 03:45.007
These corporations.

03:45.050 --> 03:46.878
These sleazeballs.

03:46.922 --> 03:48.619
These thugs.

03:48.663 --> 03:50.665
Stop spitting on me!

03:50.708 --> 03:53.537
Next up, Uncle... Roger?

03:53.581 --> 03:55.322
The topic of biodiversity loss

03:55.365 --> 03:57.759
and its effect on local
grasslands and mangroves.

03:57.802 --> 03:59.543
Oof, now I'm nervous.

03:59.587 --> 04:00.849
You got this.

04:05.332 --> 04:06.942
Alright, trees in the park,
blah blah blah.

04:06.985 --> 04:09.553
Cut 'em all down, I say.
Here's the real deal.

04:09.597 --> 04:11.903
The ancient art
of Knife Throwing.

04:11.947 --> 04:13.078
God damn it.

04:13.122 --> 04:15.690
I am Rudolfo Mayerling.

04:15.733 --> 04:18.910
After years spent quietly
perfecting my craft --

04:18.954 --> 04:20.956
and in court with
a badly wounded assistant --

04:20.999 --> 04:23.654
I am here to announce
a two-night performance

04:23.698 --> 04:27.832
in which I will present the most
daring act ever put to stage.

04:27.876 --> 04:30.792
And for the big finish
of my presentation...

04:35.623 --> 04:37.886
Flyers for my show.

04:37.929 --> 04:39.627
Oh, wait, I grabbed
the wrong stack.

04:39.670 --> 04:41.759
High school
air guitar competition?

04:41.803 --> 04:42.804
Oh, damn, I could win that.

04:42.847 --> 04:44.936
Anyway, come to my knife show.

04:47.635 --> 04:50.333
You know, Klaus,
I'm a patient woman,

04:50.377 --> 04:53.423
but it's like they're not
even trying to resurrect

04:53.467 --> 04:54.859
the World's Fair.

04:56.557 --> 04:59.473
Oh, it's our little firefighter.

04:59.516 --> 05:00.778
Hi, honey.

05:00.822 --> 05:02.040
<i>Not good, actually.</i>

05:02.084 --> 05:03.868
<i>It's not like my dreams at all.</i>

05:03.912 --> 05:06.393
<i>I thought it would be</i> <i>
60% fighting fires</i>

05:06.436 --> 05:08.133
<i>and the other half</i> <i>
shooting the breeze.</i>

05:08.177 --> 05:10.397
<i>But they got me cookin'</i> <i>
casseroles 'round the clock,</i>

05:10.440 --> 05:12.050
<i>and I think they're</i> <i>
bullying me.</i>

05:12.094 --> 05:15.619
<i>Unless, is, "Hurry up,</i> <i>
casser-hole" a compliment?</i>

05:16.794 --> 05:18.622
<i>Aw, God, I knew it.</i>

05:18.666 --> 05:20.798
<i>The only thing I get to do</i> <i>
is drive the truck --</i>

05:20.842 --> 05:22.887
Really? That sounds amazing.

05:22.931 --> 05:24.802
<i>Can I finish? Can I finish?</i>

05:24.846 --> 05:26.935
<i>I can only use it</i> <i>
to go to Trader Joe's</i>

05:26.978 --> 05:28.980
<i>for more casserole ingredients.</i>

05:29.024 --> 05:32.636
Well, Stan, you could always
just not do any of this.

05:32.680 --> 05:35.596
<i>Quit? I knew you</i> <i>
wouldn't get it.</i>

05:35.639 --> 05:38.599
<i>Thank God I'm here,</i> <i>
surrounded by my real friends.</i>

05:38.642 --> 05:40.775
<i>Alright, I gotta go.</i> <i>
The guys put a shit-ton</i>

05:40.818 --> 05:42.603
<i>of IcyHot on my balls and anus.</i>

05:48.696 --> 05:51.046
So, what do we need to get
to fix the kitchen?

05:51.089 --> 05:53.483
Plaster, some primer,

05:53.527 --> 05:56.399
three people that know
what they're doing.

05:56.443 --> 05:58.183
Excuse me. Sorry.
I know, I know.

05:58.227 --> 06:00.751
I'm sorry.
It's a fire truck, okay?

06:00.795 --> 06:03.406
Wow, they really
do send him here.

06:03.450 --> 06:05.103
You can't park that here!

06:05.147 --> 06:08.150
Gimme a break. I just need
10 spots in a row to open up.

06:08.193 --> 06:09.847
Ugh, great.

06:09.891 --> 06:12.589
You know he's gonna bring home
all that frustration

06:12.633 --> 06:14.025
and drag us down with him.

06:14.069 --> 06:16.158
They should just let him
put out a fire.

06:16.201 --> 06:17.986
Throw him a bone, ya know?

06:18.029 --> 06:21.511
That might be what we all need.

06:23.992 --> 06:26.037
Mind cracking the window
if you --

06:27.735 --> 06:30.738
A little fire is all he needs.

06:30.781 --> 06:33.523
This'll do.

06:33.567 --> 06:36.570
And I know I've got matches
in here somewhere.

06:36.613 --> 06:38.702
Phone. Brick.

06:38.746 --> 06:40.922
- What up, Franny-y-y-y!
- Got 'em.

06:58.940 --> 07:00.550
Hi.

07:00.594 --> 07:02.509
Oh, my.

07:06.904 --> 07:08.558
Stan!

07:08.602 --> 07:09.777
I-I --

07:09.820 --> 07:11.735
Aye aye aye is right.

07:11.779 --> 07:13.084
That fire was hot.

07:13.128 --> 07:14.216
And I put it out.

07:14.259 --> 07:16.914
Did you see?
I'm a firefighter.

07:16.958 --> 07:19.090
That felt. So good.

07:19.134 --> 07:21.092
Yeah, it...

07:21.136 --> 07:22.964
- did.
- I wanna do it again.

07:23.007 --> 07:25.532
- I need to.
- Me, too.

07:26.837 --> 07:28.535
What? I'm a hero.

07:28.578 --> 07:29.710
I know that!

07:29.753 --> 07:31.625
These are now honks of support!

07:34.715 --> 07:38.283
And since I put the fire out
and got the casserole fixings --

07:38.327 --> 07:40.764
maple bacon sweet potato
for the win, beyotch --

07:40.808 --> 07:42.984
the whole team said
I'm one of them now.

07:43.027 --> 07:44.594
More Crêpes Suzette, anyone?

07:44.638 --> 07:46.204
No, thank you.

07:46.248 --> 07:48.642
I'm gonna get to go on calls
for actual fires.

07:48.685 --> 07:50.644
Opa!

07:53.081 --> 07:55.039
Okay, I'd better shove off.

07:55.083 --> 07:56.911
Walk me to the door,
my beloveds?

07:56.954 --> 07:58.869
- Sure.
- You got it, Pops.

08:01.350 --> 08:04.135
Alright, lady,
what's the deal?

08:04.179 --> 08:07.617
I saw your face
after you started that fire.

08:07.661 --> 08:09.663
Did you...like it?

08:09.706 --> 08:10.968
No!

08:11.012 --> 08:12.883
I-I dunno.

08:12.927 --> 08:16.147
There was something
about striking the match,

08:16.191 --> 08:21.631
seeing the flame grow
and become so untamed.

08:21.675 --> 08:24.678
I did feel this release.

08:24.721 --> 08:26.549
And you saw Stan.

08:26.593 --> 08:28.246
If it's not doing any harm

08:28.290 --> 08:30.640
and makes things
better around here...

08:30.684 --> 08:33.251
He was pleasant just now.

08:33.295 --> 08:36.864
So long as it doesn't become
a destructive fixation for you,

08:36.907 --> 08:39.649
which I'm seeing
no warning signs of yet,

08:39.693 --> 08:43.218
this could be a classic
two birds one stone situation.

08:43.261 --> 08:45.002
Aren't those the best?

08:45.046 --> 08:47.744
Like how cigarettes taste good
and suppress

08:47.788 --> 08:49.572
your appetite
to keep you skinny.

08:49.616 --> 08:51.835
Yes! Yes.

08:51.879 --> 08:55.883
A wonderful comparison
to a wonderful product.

08:58.668 --> 09:02.063
For years, my knife throwing
peers have bored us

09:02.106 --> 09:04.718
with displays of sticking
the knife's tip

09:04.761 --> 09:06.981
within a fraction of an inch
of their subject.

09:07.024 --> 09:08.635
- Can we go?
- We live here.

09:08.678 --> 09:12.943
Tonight, I will debut the mark
of the "Artful Wound."

09:12.987 --> 09:15.380
For a true master does not miss.

09:15.424 --> 09:16.686
But cuts...

09:16.730 --> 09:18.296
and draws a single.

09:18.340 --> 09:20.734
Drop. Of blood.

09:20.777 --> 09:22.170
Sa-sah!

09:22.213 --> 09:23.214
Oh, shit.

09:23.258 --> 09:25.260
Okay, this is gonna be bad.

09:25.303 --> 09:27.784
My assistant Benny.

09:32.659 --> 09:35.183
Let's begin.

09:35.226 --> 09:37.098
Knife man!

09:37.141 --> 09:38.578
Damn it.

09:40.754 --> 09:42.799
Pop dat! Whoa!

09:42.843 --> 09:44.845
Teeee'yop Corner!

09:44.888 --> 09:46.803
Left-handed! Bank Shot!

09:46.847 --> 09:49.806
Buncha knives at once!

09:49.850 --> 09:52.417
Benny, stop flinching,
it's making me nervous.

09:52.461 --> 09:54.158
- Roger.
- Oh, hey, Steve.

09:54.202 --> 09:55.725
Stop doing this.

09:55.769 --> 09:57.248
Oh, don't worry.
This is all part of the act.

09:57.292 --> 09:58.989
They don't want
to see perfection.

09:59.033 --> 10:01.296
They want to think
something could go wrong.

10:01.339 --> 10:03.080
People are so sick.

10:03.124 --> 10:05.822
Now for my final throw
of the evening.

10:05.866 --> 10:08.303
I present -- the Artful Wound.

10:09.870 --> 10:12.220
Shame! Shame on you!

10:12.263 --> 10:14.918
This is gonna be insane.

10:22.186 --> 10:23.884
Aaaaaah!

10:23.927 --> 10:26.364
Ooh, baby!

10:29.977 --> 10:32.283
No one'll miss this thing.

10:42.119 --> 10:43.991
Oh!

10:47.734 --> 10:50.258
A barn out in the boonies?

10:50.301 --> 10:52.260
The heck happened?

10:55.785 --> 10:57.787
Chief, this wrapper
looks just like the one

10:57.831 --> 10:59.049
from the Dumpster
fire I put out.

11:01.878 --> 11:04.141
I kept this as a souvenir.

11:04.185 --> 11:05.708
Could it have been
the same person?

11:05.752 --> 11:07.318
Great instincts, Stan.

11:07.362 --> 11:08.885
What else do you see?

11:08.929 --> 11:10.757
- See?
- In the patterns.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.107
Me? Read fire patterns?

11:13.150 --> 11:14.717
Okay...um...

11:14.761 --> 11:16.806
this spot...tells me...

11:16.850 --> 11:19.374
she's a woman? A mother?

11:19.417 --> 11:22.943
Um, overshadowed by
a bigger personality at home.

11:22.986 --> 11:24.858
She's always making sacrifices.

11:24.901 --> 11:26.860
Well, we can all see
the surface patterns.

11:26.903 --> 11:29.427
Go deeper.

11:29.471 --> 11:32.517
Drinks to cope, but it's
not doing the job anymore.

11:32.561 --> 11:35.390
She's adopted,
fell down a well as a child,

11:35.433 --> 11:38.741
stints in acting,
body building, muffin sales,

11:38.785 --> 11:40.830
had her vagina displayed
in a museum --

11:40.874 --> 11:42.527
That one's just obvious.

11:42.571 --> 11:45.356
And by the looks of it,
she's just getting started.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.488
But so.

11:46.531 --> 11:47.532
Am.

11:47.576 --> 11:49.752
I.

11:49.796 --> 11:51.319
It could also be a guy, I guess.

12:24.874 --> 12:26.267
What are you doing here?

12:26.310 --> 12:27.790
Um...

12:27.834 --> 12:29.052
l-looking for this.

12:32.577 --> 12:36.277
In any event, I'm glad you're
here to see me in action.

12:36.320 --> 12:39.236
There's an arsonist on the loose
and I'm the lead investigator.

12:39.280 --> 12:42.370
They're letting you
move up fast.

12:42.413 --> 12:43.806
Yeah, it's honestly
pretty concerning.

12:43.850 --> 12:45.373
I've done zero training.

12:45.416 --> 12:47.984
But that won't stop me
from catching this crook.

12:48.028 --> 12:50.117
Nothing will.

12:52.902 --> 12:56.079
Though the chapter of my life
as a firefighter is ending,

12:56.123 --> 12:57.602
and so soon after declaring

12:57.646 --> 12:59.561
that nothing would stop me
from catching the arsonist,

12:59.604 --> 13:02.216
I cherish the fact
that the memories and friends

13:02.259 --> 13:04.609
I made along the way
are forever.

13:04.653 --> 13:07.569
Firefighters number three
and number one especially.

13:07.612 --> 13:09.223
You must be relieved.

13:09.266 --> 13:11.834
Now that Stan's retiring,
you can, too.

13:11.878 --> 13:13.531
Retire?

13:13.575 --> 13:16.230
I'm sure he'll still
wanna put some out.

13:16.273 --> 13:18.841
I'll keep the fires going
just to be safe.

13:18.885 --> 13:21.888
Francine, you have a problem.

13:21.931 --> 13:24.281
This is going to be a joke,
but please don't laugh.

13:24.325 --> 13:25.543
You're playing with fire.

13:25.587 --> 13:27.328
Hey, Stan,

13:27.371 --> 13:29.286
what was your favorite fire
from this week?

13:29.330 --> 13:31.462
Oh, man, there were so many.

13:31.506 --> 13:35.249
The old barn, the old
go-kart park, the match factory.

13:35.292 --> 13:37.077
<i>FRANCINE</i> <i>
There were so many,</i>

13:37.120 --> 13:39.122
<i>and more to come.</i>

13:42.343 --> 13:43.953
Where you going, honey?

13:43.997 --> 13:45.389
I'm about to hand off
the arson case

13:45.433 --> 13:47.348
to the new volunteer
for next week.

13:49.176 --> 13:50.960
Yeah-yeah-yeah, great.
I gotta run.

13:51.004 --> 13:52.353
We need more stuff for the crap.

13:54.964 --> 13:56.226
Francine, you dropped...

14:03.407 --> 14:04.887
What happened to your dress?

14:04.931 --> 14:06.497
Isn't it obvious?

14:06.541 --> 14:07.977
I'm tearing off pieces,

14:08.021 --> 14:09.674
shovin' 'em
in a bottle of vodka,

14:09.718 --> 14:11.894
and using it to start fires.

14:14.679 --> 14:16.159
Wait, no.

14:16.203 --> 14:18.074
She was really saying real.

14:20.337 --> 14:22.513

14:40.401 --> 14:42.316
<i>Up next, a Latin Trap Beat --</i>

14:43.665 --> 14:45.536
Helloooo!

14:45.580 --> 14:48.104
You're the arsonist.
How could you?

14:48.148 --> 14:52.413
Well, it started because I
wanted to help you, like usual.

14:52.456 --> 14:55.938
But then it awakened
something irresistible in me.

14:55.982 --> 14:58.375
So what, you have some kind
of freak fire fetish now?

14:58.419 --> 15:01.248
Do you dress in all black
leather bondage outfits?

15:01.291 --> 15:02.553
With nothing covering
your privates

15:02.597 --> 15:04.555
but, like, strips of tape?

15:04.599 --> 15:06.122
Cracking...

15:06.166 --> 15:08.255
flaming whips and, uh --

15:09.517 --> 15:11.258
Sorry, I need a second.

15:11.301 --> 15:16.306
Listen, I know "society"
doesn't like "serial arsonists."

15:16.350 --> 15:19.657
So once I complete
my masterpiece,

15:19.701 --> 15:21.616
where it all began,

15:21.659 --> 15:23.444
I'll be done.

15:23.487 --> 15:26.055
But more likely I'll do it
forever 'cause I love it.

15:26.099 --> 15:28.449
Turn back now,
or I'm turning you in.

15:28.492 --> 15:32.061
Ha! You're funnier
than Ray Romano.

15:32.105 --> 15:33.497
You don't even know
where I'll be.

15:35.325 --> 15:38.372
Wait. "Where it all began"?

15:38.415 --> 15:40.461
Oh, my God. It must be --

15:40.504 --> 15:42.028
Who are you talkin' to, Stan?

15:42.071 --> 15:43.246
Was it the arsonist?

15:43.290 --> 15:44.987
- How'd she get your number?
- Um...

15:45.031 --> 15:47.207
Stan, if you know something...

15:47.250 --> 15:48.512
Uhhhh...

15:48.556 --> 15:50.210
Spit it out, numb nuts.

15:50.253 --> 15:51.341
We have to hurry.

15:51.385 --> 15:52.647
She's gonna burn down
the firehouse.

15:52.690 --> 15:55.041
- The firehouse?!
- Hey!

15:55.084 --> 15:57.304
Thanks for the invite
to your little cookout.

15:57.347 --> 16:01.090
Real cool to see that going on
right outside my window!

16:04.485 --> 16:08.097
Anyway, I will now shock
and dazzle you

16:08.141 --> 16:10.621
with a grand
Knife Throwing finale.

16:10.665 --> 16:13.624
First, I will need a volunteer.

16:13.668 --> 16:15.278
Yes, you in the back.

16:17.498 --> 16:19.065
<i>STEVE</i> <i>
Oh, hey, Roger.</i>

16:19.108 --> 16:21.110
<i>Want to see this cute</i> <i>
baby owl video?</i>

16:21.154 --> 16:23.591
<i>Hey, let go of my hand. Hey!</i>

16:23.634 --> 16:25.114
<i>Roger, stop it.</i>

16:25.158 --> 16:26.681
<i>Let go! This isn't funny!</i>

16:26.724 --> 16:28.117
<i>I'm not wearing that.</i>

16:28.161 --> 16:30.685
<i>Ow! Roger, please -- Ow!</i>

16:30.728 --> 16:32.643
<i>What are you doing?!</i>

16:32.687 --> 16:34.776
Roger. Seriously. Stop.

16:36.299 --> 16:37.692
I'm begging you!

16:37.735 --> 16:41.652
I'm just a child!

16:41.696 --> 16:44.177
Nooooooooooooo!

16:44.220 --> 16:47.615
Now, my Grand Finale --
part one.

16:47.658 --> 16:49.617
Stop this!

16:49.660 --> 16:51.445
Denise, you need to get here
right now.

16:53.621 --> 16:58.843
Aah! Aah!

16:58.887 --> 17:00.671
Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

17:02.195 --> 17:04.153
Aah!

17:10.855 --> 17:12.596
I'm...alive.

17:18.776 --> 17:20.865
The Artful Wound.

17:20.909 --> 17:22.519
The Mark of the Master.

17:24.869 --> 17:26.349
Thank you, thank you.

17:26.393 --> 17:29.396
- Now, the true Finale.
- Wait, what?

17:29.439 --> 17:32.573
See, my act was always about
holding a mirror up to you,

17:32.616 --> 17:34.792
the audience,
and your sordid cravings.

17:34.836 --> 17:36.185
Look under your seats.

17:36.229 --> 17:37.839
Some of you will find a knife.

17:37.882 --> 17:40.885
I invite you now to face
your darkest desire,

17:40.929 --> 17:42.365
if you dare.

17:42.409 --> 17:43.323
By throwing...

17:43.366 --> 17:44.367
a knife...

17:44.411 --> 17:46.108
at me. Ow. Ow!

17:46.152 --> 17:47.501
Ow. Uhp. Ow.

17:47.544 --> 17:49.416
Wow, that's a lotta knives
hitting me.

17:49.459 --> 17:52.767
Don't remember putting
this many under...the...seats.

17:52.810 --> 17:57.728
Uhp, okay, some of you clearly
brought knives from home.

17:59.469 --> 18:02.168
Oh, I can't wait
to bust this sicko.

18:02.211 --> 18:04.213
- She's a monster!
- An animal!

18:04.257 --> 18:05.345
She's human!

18:05.388 --> 18:06.520
She's hurting.

18:06.563 --> 18:07.782
And I love her.

18:09.523 --> 18:12.134
I wanna spray her with water
so friggin' bad!

18:12.178 --> 18:13.309
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

18:21.491 --> 18:23.798
No fire. What's goin' on?

18:23.841 --> 18:25.278
Borrowing this.

18:27.236 --> 18:28.411
Guys...

18:28.455 --> 18:30.805
if he doesn't bring that back...

18:30.848 --> 18:32.676
we'll have to close
the fire station.

18:48.823 --> 18:51.347
This feels good.

18:51.391 --> 18:53.436
But not the most good.

18:53.480 --> 18:55.699
I may have to burn
a person next.

18:55.743 --> 18:57.832
- Francine!
- Aah!

18:57.875 --> 18:59.312
Well, hello to you, too.

19:00.791 --> 19:03.229
How'd you even know I'd be here?

19:03.272 --> 19:06.754
You said "where it all began,"
plus the Ray Romano jab.

19:06.797 --> 19:08.886
That could only mean
one thing --

19:08.930 --> 19:10.932
You were going to the place
where we got married.

19:10.975 --> 19:12.412
Aah! Uhh!

19:14.936 --> 19:17.199
I booked our wedding
at my dream venue --

19:17.243 --> 19:19.897
Knee Slapperz Comedy Club,
but Ray Romano

19:19.941 --> 19:22.465
showed up five minutes before
to do a surprise set,

19:22.509 --> 19:23.640
and we got bumped.

19:23.684 --> 19:26.643
Yeah, and you had a meltdown.

19:26.687 --> 19:29.342
But you scrambled
and found this place.

19:29.385 --> 19:31.822
You decorated the bins,
filled them with ice...

19:31.866 --> 19:34.390
a family of raccoons
were the flower girls.

19:34.434 --> 19:35.478
Aah!

19:36.958 --> 19:38.264
Ta-daaa!

19:38.307 --> 19:40.527
Whoa!

19:40.570 --> 19:42.311
It's too late, Stan.

19:42.355 --> 19:43.530
I can't stop.

19:43.573 --> 19:44.879
Of course you can.

19:44.922 --> 19:46.446
You only became an arsonist

19:46.489 --> 19:48.578
because I pushed you
toward it all these years.

19:48.622 --> 19:50.885
Arsonist is such an ugly term.

19:50.928 --> 19:52.887
We prefer Friend of the Flame.

19:52.930 --> 19:54.671
Or fire

19:54.715 --> 19:57.805
I need to learn how to handle
my disappointment myself,

19:57.848 --> 19:59.589
or at least take it out
on the kids.

19:59.633 --> 20:01.591
You do take it out on the kids.

20:01.635 --> 20:02.897
I could do it more.

20:02.940 --> 20:05.029
Oh, Stan.

20:05.073 --> 20:06.857
Thank you.

20:06.901 --> 20:08.903
To be clear, though, this is
messed up, what you're doing,

20:08.946 --> 20:10.948
and I think you should
see a doctor in addition

20:10.992 --> 20:12.776
to me being,
like, more attentive.

20:12.820 --> 20:14.256
Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah, totes.

20:16.650 --> 20:18.652
How are we gonna
get out of here?

20:18.695 --> 20:21.829
Baby, all you do
is sacrifice for me.

20:21.872 --> 20:24.397
It's time I repay the favor.

20:24.440 --> 20:27.313
We're gonna leave exactly
how we did on our wedding day.

20:27.356 --> 20:30.925
Except this time,
I'm going to carry you.

20:35.843 --> 20:37.061
There's people in there!

20:37.105 --> 20:38.541
Someone help them!

20:38.585 --> 20:39.412
There they are!

20:39.455 --> 20:41.283
They're okay!

20:41.327 --> 20:43.459
- Ohhhh!
- Ohhhh!

20:43.503 --> 20:44.765
He's not okay!

20:44.808 --> 20:46.593
He's in terrible shape!

20:49.857 --> 20:51.424
MAN #2: He's gonna
say something!

20:56.080 --> 20:58.082
Bye! Have a great time!
