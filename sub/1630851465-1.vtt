Oh, yeah, let's run that
right now.

00:55.263 --> 00:57.514
-What up, yo?
My name is La'Britney.

00:57.515 --> 00:59.975
I am a music artist, actress.

00:59.976 --> 01:04.897
I am a mother, entrepreneur,
all of the above.

01:04.898 --> 01:08.150
You may have seen me
on social media.

01:08.151 --> 01:11.028
I have a lot of content
that has gone viral.

01:11.029 --> 01:13.489
You may have seen me
on a television screen

01:13.490 --> 01:15.282
on TV shows before.

01:15.283 --> 01:18.202
You may have seen
my music videos on TV shows.

01:18.203 --> 01:20.204
You may have heard me
on the radio before

01:20.205 --> 01:22.039
while you driving
down the freeway.

01:22.040 --> 01:25.125
I am notorious
for making a way out of no way.

01:25.126 --> 01:28.462
Detroit breeds hustlers,
you know what I'm sayin'?

01:28.463 --> 01:31.256
Like, I never had,
like, a silver platter

01:31.257 --> 01:32.633
just handed to me.

01:32.634 --> 01:34.343
Like, everything that I have,

01:34.344 --> 01:37.179
I've worked hard for,
sacrificed.

01:37.180 --> 01:39.932
I'm a very ambitious,
very driven,

01:39.933 --> 01:41.767
goal-orientated woman.

01:41.768 --> 01:45.229
And if I want it,
I go and get it.

01:45.230 --> 01:46.773
-Mm-hmm.

01:48.233 --> 01:49.566
There we go.

01:49.567 --> 01:51.945
[Camera shutter clicking]

01:53.321 --> 01:54.571
Yep.

01:54.572 --> 01:58.200
-Having new and fresh
social media content

01:58.201 --> 02:00.661
is very important
because I get paid

02:00.662 --> 02:02.579
a lot of money for these things,
you know?

02:02.580 --> 02:05.874
Working with different brands
and different companies

02:05.875 --> 02:08.919
is a way that I provide
for my family.

02:08.920 --> 02:11.046
-Yes. Outfit, too.

02:11.047 --> 02:13.841
- Pink Panther.
- [Laughs]

02:13.842 --> 02:16.385
- I like those. Oh, that's fire.
- Oh, shoot. Uh-huh.

02:16.386 --> 02:18.595
The full-body ones?
- Mm-hmm.

02:18.596 --> 02:20.931
That camera's so broken,
but it look good.

02:20.932 --> 02:23.725
[Laughter]

02:23.726 --> 02:26.687
It's a vibe.
- Oh, my God, that is gorgeous!

02:26.688 --> 02:29.773
- Ah!
- Yes! You killed these.

02:29.774 --> 02:31.733
- With the baby hairs.
- Yes!

02:31.734 --> 02:32.901
This is perfect.

02:32.902 --> 02:34.570
This is exactly what we needed
for content.

02:34.571 --> 02:36.321
- Yeah.
- And the outfit and everything.

02:36.322 --> 02:38.532
Y'all killed that.
- Right there.

02:38.533 --> 02:40.576
-I love it.

02:40.577 --> 02:44.079
-You have layers just like...
perfect.

02:44.080 --> 02:46.957
Like, you just... this is where
you should be, for sure.

02:46.958 --> 02:48.333
-I agree.

02:48.334 --> 02:50.002
I always feel like that
when I'm here...

02:50.003 --> 02:51.920
- Yeah.
- Like I belong.

02:51.921 --> 02:54.089
I've been looking for a...
A crib.

02:54.090 --> 02:55.799
- It's been tough.
- Yeah.

02:55.800 --> 02:58.302
-It's been a struggle
driving all around California...

02:58.303 --> 02:59.970
- Mm-hmm.
- In traffic all day.

02:59.971 --> 03:01.388
- Yeah.
- But I know I'll find something.

03:01.389 --> 03:02.598
-You'll definitely find
something.

03:02.599 --> 03:03.974
- You know, it's a process.
- Yep.

03:03.975 --> 03:05.517
-But it's gonna come together.

03:05.518 --> 03:08.187
Moving from Detroit to L.A.,
the biggest challenge

03:08.188 --> 03:11.481
is the difference
in the cost of living.

03:11.482 --> 03:16.195
But it's worth it to me because
I know being in California,

03:16.196 --> 03:17.571
there are opportunities here

03:17.572 --> 03:20.532
that I can't get anywhere else
as a music artist.

03:20.533 --> 03:24.369
So I'm investing a lot of time.
I invested a lot of money.

03:24.370 --> 03:25.996
I have a lot at stake here.

03:25.997 --> 03:27.456
-Here comes Mehgan.
Hey, girl.

03:27.457 --> 03:28.665
-Hey, girl!

03:28.666 --> 03:30.500
It's good to see you.
- Glad you could make it.

03:30.501 --> 03:33.962
I'm Mehgan James.
I'm an social media influencer.

03:33.963 --> 03:37.507
I have over a million followers
on my social media platforms.

03:37.508 --> 03:42.638
I'm perceived as this bully,
this bad girl, this wild child.

03:42.639 --> 03:45.098
I'm notorious for being
in all these blogs

03:45.099 --> 03:48.185
and dating all these men,
but I'm so much more than that.

03:48.186 --> 03:51.230
Like, I'm an entrepreneur,
I'm a hustler,

03:51.231 --> 03:52.731
and I'm here to conquer L.A.

03:52.732 --> 03:55.609
People think I have a temper,
but I say what's on my mind,

03:55.610 --> 03:57.194
and I don't back down
from anyone.

03:57.195 --> 04:00.155
I'm going to get what I want
out of life by any means.

04:00.156 --> 04:02.824
How you been doing?
- Good. And this is La'Britney.

04:02.825 --> 04:04.159
- Hey, girl!
- Hi, Mehgan.

04:04.160 --> 04:05.535
So nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

04:05.536 --> 04:07.246
- I'll let you guys go vibe.
- Thank you.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.830
- Shoe twin, hello.
- Thank you.

04:08.831 --> 04:10.540
What's good, girl?
What's going on?

04:10.541 --> 04:12.834
- Nothing.
- La'Britney just moved.

04:12.835 --> 04:14.586
- Okay, fresh meat.
- Yes.

04:14.587 --> 04:16.380
- Okay.
- No, not fresh meat.

04:16.381 --> 04:18.215
I'm just moving back.
- Oh, you're moving back.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.675
- Yeah.
- Okay, so you went back, too.

04:19.676 --> 04:21.343
You went back.
I've been here like six years.

04:21.344 --> 04:23.178
-I heard you got some fire
swimsuit.

04:23.179 --> 04:25.389
-After you're done,
we can go to my office,

04:25.390 --> 04:27.140
and you can look
at all my stuff.

04:27.141 --> 04:28.308
-All right.

04:28.309 --> 04:31.228
Ashley suggested that I meet
this girl Mehgan.

04:31.229 --> 04:34.439
She knows Mehgan has a great
social media following

04:34.440 --> 04:35.649
and swimsuit line.

04:35.650 --> 04:38.694
So you never know,
like, what opportunity

04:38.695 --> 04:41.780
can come out of
you meetin' somebody new.

04:41.781 --> 04:43.657
-Yes. Mm-hmm.

04:43.658 --> 04:46.201
- Hourglassfigure.com.
- Yes.

04:46.202 --> 04:47.828
- Yes!
- Perfect.

04:47.829 --> 04:49.454
That's exactly where it's at.

04:49.455 --> 04:53.583
-My first impression of
La'Britney is, like,

04:53.584 --> 04:56.128
I was confused because, like,

04:56.129 --> 04:57.629
Ashley told me she's R&B artist.

04:57.630 --> 05:00.299
Like, I was thinking
she was gonna look like Ashanti

05:00.300 --> 05:01.925
or something, like Beyoncé.

05:01.926 --> 05:05.721
And she had on, like, sweatpants
and, like, a tank.

05:05.722 --> 05:09.099
Like, she just didn't look like
an R&B artist to me.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.684
-Okay, let's go look at
some swimsuits.

05:10.685 --> 05:12.519
- Okay, cool.
- Yes. Ashley...

05:12.520 --> 05:13.812
- I gotta get up out of here.
- Yes.

05:13.813 --> 05:15.022
-I got a meeting to run to,

05:15.023 --> 05:16.440
but I just knew y'all
would hit it off.

05:16.441 --> 05:17.858
So you guys have fun.
- Thank you so much.

05:17.859 --> 05:19.860
- Nice meeting you.
- Love you.

05:19.861 --> 05:21.278
- Love you, too.
- Ah. See you later.

05:21.279 --> 05:23.155
Let me know when you
get out of your meeting.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.990
- Okay.
- See you at home.

05:24.991 --> 05:27.075

05:43.843 --> 05:45.969

05:45.970 --> 05:47.304
Boy?
- Well, come on in.

05:47.305 --> 05:49.806
I'm just unpacking,
trying to get settled in.

06:01.986 --> 06:03.612
-My name is Stormey Ramdhan.

06:03.613 --> 06:08.658
I most known for being
an ex-fiancée of Suge Knight.

06:08.659 --> 06:12.746
We have two wonderful sons
that we raise together.

06:12.747 --> 06:14.664
I'm never the one
that's gonna be picked on.

06:14.665 --> 06:16.958
I'm never gonna be the one
that's gonna sit down

06:16.959 --> 06:19.294
and just let someone
walk all over me.

06:19.295 --> 06:22.798
So if you poke the bear,
mama bear's gonna wake up.

06:22.799 --> 06:23.924
I don't do bogus things,

06:23.925 --> 06:26.218
and I don't fuck with
bogus bitches.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.303
Sorry, I don't.
[Laughs]

06:28.304 --> 06:29.638
He does know, and...

06:29.639 --> 06:30.972
- He does?
- Yeah.

06:30.973 --> 06:34.101
So he's happy about that because
we're closer to... for...

06:34.102 --> 06:36.061
You know, to go see him.
- Oh, good, good, good.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.854
-Yeah, 'cause, you know,
he's in San Diego, so...

06:37.855 --> 06:39.022
-No, yes.

06:39.023 --> 06:40.982
-You know, I-I felt like
I needed to be back.

06:40.983 --> 06:43.318
- Yes, yes. Your mom.
- Mom. Like, that's wonderful.

06:43.319 --> 06:45.237
- Oh!
- You know, and I needed to be

06:45.238 --> 06:46.738
here for Sugey and the baby,
too.

06:46.739 --> 06:48.448
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Mm-hmm.

06:48.449 --> 06:51.701
So, you know, when I left,
I left unhappy, you know?

06:51.702 --> 06:53.703
I felt... I felt unsupported.

06:53.704 --> 06:57.124
Um, I just felt like everything
was coming down on us.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.960
You know, Suge had just recently
went back to prison,

06:59.961 --> 07:02.087
and, you know...
- Oh, that would be a lot.

07:02.088 --> 07:03.547
- I felt like
I was here by myself.

07:03.548 --> 07:05.841
And I know I have you guys,
my family, here,

07:05.842 --> 07:07.884
but I-I just wasn't
in a good place.

07:07.885 --> 07:10.095
So I had needed to leave.
- Okay.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.305
-Um, you know,
I was just really broken.

07:12.306 --> 07:14.057
-Okay, we'll take it one step
at a time.

07:14.058 --> 07:15.684
-But... But there are
some concerns.

07:15.685 --> 07:18.186
But, you know, I'm... I don't
want to live in the shadows

07:18.187 --> 07:21.106
of being Suge's baby mama
no more.

07:21.107 --> 07:22.190
-Yes, right, right.

07:22.191 --> 07:23.525
-You know,
the kids is grown now.

07:23.526 --> 07:26.278
I feel like a lot of time
has passed,

07:26.279 --> 07:29.739
and it's... it's time for a...
Just a new start.

07:29.740 --> 07:33.326
It's been very difficult
being synonymous with Suge.

07:33.327 --> 07:35.036
But you know what?
I don't even look at it

07:35.037 --> 07:36.163
as a difficulty anymore.

07:36.164 --> 07:37.914
I now wear it
as a badge of honor,

07:37.915 --> 07:39.541
because that's a part
of my life,

07:39.542 --> 07:41.960
and, um,
it has made me who I am.

07:41.961 --> 07:44.629
And now I'm totally confident
who I am as a woman

07:44.630 --> 07:47.174
and what I can do
and what I bring to the table.

07:47.175 --> 07:50.218
Also, I got a girls' night plan
comin' up.

07:50.219 --> 07:54.681
I'm trying to just gather
a few strong women, you know,

07:54.682 --> 07:56.850
and just to create
a good support system

07:56.851 --> 07:59.978
through me coming back here,
you know, trying to just get

07:59.979 --> 08:01.605
good, positive people in my life

08:01.606 --> 08:03.440
and just establish
new friendships.

08:03.441 --> 08:05.233
-Right, right, right.
I'm glad.

08:05.234 --> 08:07.444
-So, uh, yeah.
I mean, it's needed.

08:07.445 --> 08:09.279
So that's what I want.
- Okay.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.281
You know, I want to come back
L.A. right.

08:11.282 --> 08:12.532
-Okay.

08:12.533 --> 08:14.534
-I also want to ask you
what you think if we, um...

08:14.535 --> 08:16.328
I want to do something
for my mom for...

08:16.329 --> 08:17.954
- Absolutely, yes, yes.
- Bringing us all together.

08:17.955 --> 08:19.164
You know, it's been too long.

08:19.165 --> 08:20.749
-It's one of the reasons
why I'm here, yes.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.417
-My mom has just been
recently released from prison.

08:22.418 --> 08:26.421
She was accused of hiring
someone to kill her husband.

08:26.422 --> 08:29.466
After doing 24 years
in state prison,

08:29.467 --> 08:30.634
she's released.

08:30.635 --> 08:32.427
We have to make up
for a lot of lost time.

08:32.428 --> 08:36.431
24 years... that's a lifetime
of, um... of memories

08:36.432 --> 08:38.225
that we have
to rebuild with her.

08:38.226 --> 08:41.144
And, um, so L.A.
is where I should be.

08:41.145 --> 08:44.856
What has she talked about
with you that she may want?

08:44.857 --> 08:46.691
- Some lobster.
- Lobster?

08:46.692 --> 08:48.026
- Yeah.
- You know she fancy.

08:48.027 --> 08:49.486
-Yeah, yeah, yes. Oh, yes.

08:49.487 --> 08:51.947
-I want her to taste my cooking.
You know, it's been too long...

08:51.948 --> 08:53.365
- Yeah, yeah.
- So I want to make something

08:53.366 --> 08:54.699
delicious for her.
- Yes.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.451
I don't think she's tried
your cooking, has she?

08:56.452 --> 08:57.619
-No, not really. No.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.996
That's a new beginning
in itself.

08:59.997 --> 09:02.457
It's definitely tragic
that my mother hasn't been able

09:02.458 --> 09:03.750
to be a part of my life.

09:03.751 --> 09:06.169
I've shared as much
as I could through letters,

09:06.170 --> 09:07.754
through phone calls,
through pictures.

09:07.755 --> 09:10.715
But when you're not there
to actually experience the joys

09:10.716 --> 09:12.717
and the laughters,
I'm sure she feels robbed.

09:12.718 --> 09:16.721
And, um, I couldn't imagine that
for myself with my own children.

09:16.722 --> 09:19.140
That's another reason why it was
important for me to be here.

09:19.141 --> 09:20.809
- Yes, for sure.
- You know, as I'm looking for

09:20.810 --> 09:23.853
my own support system and...
And things she needs,

09:23.854 --> 09:26.147
I need to be there for her.
- After 24 years?

09:26.148 --> 09:27.440
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.

09:27.441 --> 09:29.359
-Yeah, 24 years is a long time
to be away.

09:29.360 --> 09:32.070
-A long time. And you all didn't
think she was coming out.

09:32.071 --> 09:34.906
-We didn't. It was surprising
when we got that phone call.

09:34.907 --> 09:37.993
-I always, always believed.

09:37.994 --> 09:39.411
-There are some challenges.

09:39.412 --> 09:42.038
During the past 24 years,
people change,

09:42.039 --> 09:43.331
the world has changed,

09:43.332 --> 09:45.542
and now we have to learn
her over,

09:45.543 --> 09:48.545
because she has gone through
things that we couldn't imagine

09:48.546 --> 09:51.631
and just understand that she...
It's gonna take some time

09:51.632 --> 09:53.091
for her to get used to
some things.

09:53.092 --> 09:57.429
-So just with the judge
tell her life without,

09:57.430 --> 09:58.972
I'll never forget that day.

09:58.973 --> 10:00.557
-I'll never forget that day,
either. It was...

10:00.558 --> 10:02.642
- Never forget that day.
- Two... what, a day before

10:02.643 --> 10:05.562
my birthday when my mother was
sentenced to life.

10:05.563 --> 10:08.565
- It was... It was... It was...
- That was, um...

10:08.566 --> 10:09.733
It was really life-changing.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.735
-Absolute.
Yes, for all of us.

10:11.736 --> 10:14.070
- Yeah. You know how it felt.
- Her being my best friend.

10:14.071 --> 10:15.822
-Remember when my birthday,
when I didn't want to

10:15.823 --> 10:17.991
celebrate my birthday anymore?
- Yeah.

10:17.992 --> 10:21.661
Yeah. Yeah, it hurts...

10:21.662 --> 10:23.538
- Yeah.
- To know that the day

10:23.539 --> 10:25.874
that you're supposed to
celebrate your... your birthday,

10:25.875 --> 10:29.586
be happy, that's the day
that you lose your mother.

10:29.587 --> 10:31.463
-Mm.

10:31.464 --> 10:34.090
- So, but I got her back.
- Go, girl. Yes!

10:34.091 --> 10:36.217
Yes, you got your mom back.
- Got her back.

11:13.214 --> 11:14.756
-I gotta show you.
See, can I show you?

11:14.757 --> 11:18.635
Okay, so basically
I'm working on my swimwear line

11:18.636 --> 11:22.180
for this season,
so this is piece number one.

11:22.181 --> 11:23.807
Burnt orange.
- Okay. I like that color.

11:23.808 --> 11:27.102
-I love underwire bras
'cause I have really big boobs.

11:27.103 --> 11:29.729
So they have to be, like,
sit up, mm-hmm.

11:29.730 --> 11:31.064
And then you can touch
and feel the quality.

11:31.065 --> 11:32.524
Like, give me
your honest opinion

11:32.525 --> 11:34.734
because, like, I need to know.

11:34.735 --> 11:37.487
-The top... I really like
the style of the top.

11:37.488 --> 11:38.947
- Thank you.
- I love the thin straps

11:38.948 --> 11:40.532
in the back and the underwire.

11:40.533 --> 11:43.159
I think, you know, if you got
a nice set of titties,

11:43.160 --> 11:44.703
it's gonna look great.

11:44.704 --> 11:45.912
-Period!

11:45.913 --> 11:48.081
So tell me about you.
What's your background?

11:48.082 --> 11:51.209
-I'm from Detroit.
Um, I'm a mother.

11:51.210 --> 11:53.712
I am a music artist.
- Wait. Hold up.

11:53.713 --> 11:56.172
Skrrr. Rewind. Mother where?

11:56.173 --> 11:59.217
- Yeah, a mother. Girl, yes.
- Where?!

11:59.218 --> 12:00.635
- I have two...
- God, please.

12:00.636 --> 12:04.013
- I have two teenage sons.
- No way. You look so good.

12:04.014 --> 12:05.515
- Yeah, thank you.
- You look so good.

12:05.516 --> 12:08.017
-Yeah, I was young
when I had them, so...

12:08.018 --> 12:09.227
-Like, how young?

12:09.228 --> 12:12.355
-I was 15 years old
when I had my oldest son.

12:12.356 --> 12:13.481
- Gosh.
- Yeah.

12:13.482 --> 12:16.234
-When I found out
I was pregnant, um,

12:16.235 --> 12:20.947
actually, I didn't tell anyone
for like seven months,

12:20.948 --> 12:24.033
but eventually I couldn't
hide my stomach anymore,

12:24.034 --> 12:26.661
and I ended up
having to tell my mama

12:26.662 --> 12:30.790
and just thank God I have such
a supportive family, you know,

12:30.791 --> 12:35.628
because my life had changed
so drastically just,

12:35.629 --> 12:38.131
you know, overnight like that.

12:38.132 --> 12:40.592
My life was a lot different
than my friends'.

12:40.593 --> 12:43.887
But I'm blessed 'cause I have
a great support system.

12:43.888 --> 12:45.263
- Mm-hmm.
- My family is amazing.

12:45.264 --> 12:47.932
So I've still been able
to pursue my dreams

12:47.933 --> 12:49.225
and accomplish my goals

12:49.226 --> 12:52.145
and, you know, do everything
I've wanted to do.

12:52.146 --> 12:54.981
- Right.
- I ain't miss no beat.

12:54.982 --> 12:56.357
But I'm excited to be back here

12:56.358 --> 12:58.401
because I have new music
that I'm about to put out...

12:58.402 --> 13:01.154
- Yes!
- And new music videos.

13:01.155 --> 13:02.530
I... I'm a hustler.

13:02.531 --> 13:04.824
Like, I'm notorious for making
a way out of no way.

13:04.825 --> 13:05.992
- Hear ya.
- You know, like,

13:05.993 --> 13:08.119
how I was raised,
like, you know,

13:08.120 --> 13:09.871
we ain't the richest family.
- Right.

13:09.872 --> 13:11.748
-We don't have... opportunity

13:11.749 --> 13:13.374
just don't come knocking
at our door.

13:13.375 --> 13:15.960
So, you know, we go
and take that shit, ya feel me?

13:15.961 --> 13:17.712
- Mm-hmm.
- So I'm excited to be here,

13:17.713 --> 13:20.381
and I'm really excited
that Ashley introduced us.

13:20.382 --> 13:21.883
- I know!
- You know, because

13:21.884 --> 13:23.468
your clothing line is fire,
and, you know,

13:23.469 --> 13:27.096
I love to support women
who are just making shit happen,

13:27.097 --> 13:28.264
you feel me?
- Yeah.

13:28.265 --> 13:29.599
-I think that we can have
some fun.

13:29.600 --> 13:30.934
-Okay, cool, I'm excited.

13:30.935 --> 13:32.602
After spending some time
with La'Britney

13:32.603 --> 13:34.813
and hearing her story,
I have so much respect for her.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.398
I really think
we could be friends.

First Lady of BMF.

14:06.178 --> 14:07.720
I'm from Detroit, Michigan.

14:07.721 --> 14:11.140
I'm known for being a part
of the Black Mafia family.

14:11.141 --> 14:14.811
We were allegedly known
for being one of the largest

14:14.812 --> 14:18.815
Black drug organizations
around the United States.

14:18.816 --> 14:20.108
We started in the '80s,

14:20.109 --> 14:24.028
and our indictments
happened in 2005.

14:24.029 --> 14:27.907
Going to prison changed me
as a person and made me sit down

14:27.908 --> 14:30.243
and think about the people
that I was hurting.

14:30.244 --> 14:33.872
I still look at myself
that I have a lot of work to do.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.791
- You have a coaster? We fine?
- We fine, girl, go on.

14:36.792 --> 14:39.127
How you been?
- Just getting resettled

14:39.128 --> 14:40.920
back in L.A., um...
- Uh-huh.

14:40.921 --> 14:42.589
-You know,
got a new grandbaby...

14:42.590 --> 14:44.090
- What?!
- And my mother's home.

14:44.091 --> 14:46.634
- Who had a baby?
- Sugey, my... my oldest.

14:46.635 --> 14:48.678
- Oh!
- We happy about it.

14:48.679 --> 14:51.681
I got a new baby,
got a little girl now.

14:51.682 --> 14:53.224
-I'm glad you back, too.

14:53.225 --> 14:57.270
I met Stormey... I've known her
about four years now.

14:57.271 --> 15:01.274
I think having Stormey in L.A.
is gonna be great

15:01.275 --> 15:03.359
'cause we have
so much in common.

15:03.360 --> 15:06.029
I can relate to her
and she can relate to me

15:06.030 --> 15:07.363
because of our background.

15:07.364 --> 15:08.865
- I'm happy to be back.
- Yeah.

15:08.866 --> 15:10.825
-I was a little reluctant
about coming back,

15:10.826 --> 15:12.160
but, you know,
my new grandbaby here,

15:12.161 --> 15:13.745
my mama being here,
getting out...

15:13.746 --> 15:16.623
- How long mom's been out?
- My mom has been out a month.

15:16.624 --> 15:18.458
You know, she was down
for 24 years.

15:18.459 --> 15:20.043
- Right!
- Yes.

15:20.044 --> 15:21.669
- Wow.
- So, yeah.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.004
-How does she feel?

15:23.005 --> 15:25.506
-She's, um, getting acclimated
back into, you know,

15:25.507 --> 15:26.966
the flow of things.
- Uh-huh.

15:26.967 --> 15:28.343
-Everything's new to her

15:28.344 --> 15:31.095
-If she needs any help,
you know, I do prison reform,

15:31.096 --> 15:32.931
helping women
when they come back home.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.433
I'd be happy to help her
any kind of way.

15:35.434 --> 15:36.851
- I would love for that.
- Yeah.

15:36.852 --> 15:38.436
- I would love for that.
- If she needs somebody

15:38.437 --> 15:40.229
to talk to, 'cause, you know,
I've been there.

15:40.230 --> 15:44.400
- Yeah.
- I went to prison in 2008,

15:44.401 --> 15:47.111
and I was charged
with money laundering.

15:47.112 --> 15:49.781
I served three years,
two months.

15:49.782 --> 15:54.327
Before prison, I didn't realize
I was living life selfishly.

15:54.328 --> 15:57.288
Came from a lavish life,
and I walked into prison,

15:57.289 --> 15:59.207
and everything was different.

15:59.208 --> 16:04.337
You said you were reluctant
about coming back to L.A. Why?

16:04.338 --> 16:06.255
-Well...

16:06.256 --> 16:08.508
for one reason...
- Mm-hmm.

16:08.509 --> 16:10.927
- Um, after what happened
with Suge

16:10.928 --> 16:14.681
and the person
that had passed away...

16:14.682 --> 16:15.932
-Mm-hmm.

16:15.933 --> 16:18.643
- L.A. became
a little unsafe for us.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.061
- Right.
- So, and I had...

16:20.062 --> 16:22.146
- There was a lot of tension.
- It was a lot of tension.

16:22.147 --> 16:24.190
And, you know,
someone had expressed to me

16:24.191 --> 16:26.442
something they wanted
to do to my kids.

16:26.443 --> 16:28.069
- Oh, wow.
- And so, and they even

16:28.070 --> 16:31.656
expressed something that I felt
made me feel uncomfortable.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.157
I'm not gonna say too much,

16:33.158 --> 16:36.202
but I just decided that it was
time to... for us to leave

16:36.203 --> 16:39.789
and then, you know,
me keep my family safe.

16:39.790 --> 16:40.873
-Right.

16:40.874 --> 16:43.042
-My association with
my kids' dad

16:43.043 --> 16:46.587
has opened up us
to be targets for threats.

16:46.588 --> 16:50.008
It started out with comments
from, you know, social media.

16:50.009 --> 16:53.136
But no threat ever makes
you feel comfortable,

16:53.137 --> 16:55.096
and no threat
should ever be ignored.

16:55.097 --> 16:59.017
But I just have to be, um,
cautious about my surroundings.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.893
But now,
since my family is still...

17:00.894 --> 17:03.688
You know, my son has moved back
and he has a family here

17:03.689 --> 17:06.024
and my mom's here,
I feel like I have to be here.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.984
-Yeah, it just feels right.
Gotcha.

17:07.985 --> 17:09.736

-Yeah.

33:26.754 --> 33:28.046
When I first met Mehgan,

33:28.047 --> 33:30.757
I met her a while back
at a basketball game,

33:30.758 --> 33:34.428
and she gave me
this vibe as like,

33:34.429 --> 33:36.013
"Ugh. Ugh.

33:36.014 --> 33:40.434
You know, I'm just, you know,
like... I'm out here

33:40.435 --> 33:42.978
just trying to get this money,

33:42.979 --> 33:44.479
and I don't care
about nothin' else.

33:44.480 --> 33:47.482
I'm beautiful, and I'm just
gonna get this money."

33:47.483 --> 33:50.444
That's what she remind me of.

33:50.445 --> 33:52.195
-Like, I'm kind of like
the opposite of La'Britney

33:52.196 --> 33:55.449
because I've never had, um,
family support.

33:55.450 --> 33:57.701
Um, they're... I'm like
the black sheep of the family.

My brother plays in the NFL.

34:01.497 --> 34:04.666
Um, I'm not really close
to my dad's side of the family.

34:04.667 --> 34:08.170
Um, they don't understand,
like, my hustle.

34:08.171 --> 34:10.714
-Hearing Mehgan's situation
and hearing that

34:10.715 --> 34:12.424
she's the black sheep
of her family,

34:12.425 --> 34:15.719
I couldn't imagine not feeling
supported or not feeling loved.

34:15.720 --> 34:18.221
She has this front
that she's put up.

34:18.222 --> 34:20.682
But I think deep down inside,
she's hurting.

34:20.683 --> 34:24.686
Well, ladies, um,
born and raised in Los Angeles.

34:24.687 --> 34:26.521
I'm from the Crenshaw district,

34:26.522 --> 34:29.357
that should tell you right there
what... who I am.

34:29.358 --> 34:33.737

when I met my kids' dad,

34:33.738 --> 34:37.157
and you guys probably know
who is... Suge Knight.

34:37.158 --> 34:39.910

34:44.082 --> 34:48.293
like, don't-know-if-
he-killed-Tupac Suge Knight?

34:48.294 --> 34:50.962
-Um, I try not to let that
define me.

34:50.963 --> 34:53.215
- Right.
- And, um, that's who I am.

34:53.216 --> 34:55.175
-Come on.

34:55.176 --> 34:57.552
- That's who I'm gonna be.
- Period.

34:57.553 --> 35:00.055
- And that's what it is.
- Okay!

35:00.056 --> 35:03.100
No, wow. Yo.
Y'all some legends.

35:03.101 --> 35:04.351
-For real.

35:04.352 --> 35:06.394
Maybe I did judge the girls
a little too soon.

35:06.395 --> 35:08.021
Just because they're older
doesn't mean

35:08.022 --> 35:09.940
that we can't be friends.

35:09.941 --> 35:11.858
Like, I mean,
I could learn from them.

35:11.859 --> 35:13.318
They're older, duh.

35:13.319 --> 35:16.363
Like, they've lived like 20
years of life than I... than me.

35:16.364 --> 35:19.491
I don't know.
They're still, like, old.

35:29.252 --> 35:31.044

35:31.045 --> 35:34.798
As much as I want to discuss
the issue with her...

35:34.799 --> 35:37.259

about discussing it
in front of Mehgan and Stormey.

35:40.930 --> 35:44.225

that I do it one-on-one.

Be. -Yes.

35:47.103 --> 35:49.312

energy away.

35:54.819 --> 35:56.486
I just keep it all away.
- So are you... are you, like,

35:56.487 --> 35:59.531

- I am. I love crystals.

35:59.532 --> 36:00.824
- Oh!
- I burn sage.

36:00.825 --> 36:02.242
-Later on in the week,
I'm having a little

36:02.243 --> 36:04.744

We should do it here
at the house.

36:06.622 --> 36:08.874
-Um, one of my favorite psychics
is gonna come by my house.

36:08.875 --> 36:10.709
- Oh, hell no!
- Oh!

36:10.710 --> 36:14.504
-When I think of a psychic,
I think of, like, Miss Cleo.

36:14.505 --> 36:16.965
I think of, like, a witch.
You feel me?

36:16.966 --> 36:19.634
Like, I think of, like,
all these cards

36:19.635 --> 36:21.511

36:21.512 --> 36:23.763
and all these weird
black-magic shit.

36:23.764 --> 36:26.892
Like, where I'm from,
we don't do psychics.

36:26.893 --> 36:28.602
I don't.
- I do.

36:28.603 --> 36:29.728
- Why?!
- I do.

36:29.729 --> 36:31.229
-It's supposed to be
entertainment.

36:31.230 --> 36:33.481
- Nah, it's the truth.
- It's the truth?

36:33.482 --> 36:34.983
-I'm a very spiritual person.

36:34.984 --> 36:38.195
And, um, being that
I don't know these ladies,

36:38.196 --> 36:40.822
like, I need the psychic
to tell me all their tea,

36:40.823 --> 36:44.784
because I feel like some people
are hiding a few things,

36:44.785 --> 36:47.787
and I definitely
need to know what's up.

36:47.788 --> 36:49.956
Same... I've been having the
same psychic for like six years,

36:49.957 --> 36:51.958
so I'd rather talk to somebody
that's unbiased, that's...

36:51.959 --> 36:55.128
That I feel like can guide me,
even though that sounds crazy.

36:55.129 --> 36:57.047

my perfect man,

36:57.048 --> 36:58.798
like, everything that
I would want in a man.

36:58.799 --> 37:01.468
And I read it every single day,
and I know he comin', period.

37:01.469 --> 37:03.470
-See, and that's
half the battle...

37:03.471 --> 37:04.846
Knowing exactly what you want.

37:04.847 --> 37:06.264
So you sticking this
into existence.

37:06.265 --> 37:08.225
-Unh-unh, that's some L.A. shit.

37:08.226 --> 37:10.477
-I just feel like in a world
full of futures,

37:10.478 --> 37:12.312
there's a Russell for me,
period.

37:12.313 --> 37:14.189
- Yeah.
- And he there and he comin'.

37:14.190 --> 37:16.608
- Period.
- My friends be talking...

37:16.609 --> 37:18.026
Calling me Heartbreak Drake.

37:18.027 --> 37:19.819
I'm like, "Girl, listen."
- Mm-hmm.

37:19.820 --> 37:21.613
"You gotta let it go when it's
time to let it go.

37:21.614 --> 37:23.740

with some shit that you know

37:23.741 --> 37:25.492
is not gonna work."
- It's not gonna work!

37:25.493 --> 37:27.118
-Pay attention to the warning
signs.

37:27.119 --> 37:29.037
- Oh, I've been there, done that.
- Okay?

37:29.038 --> 37:31.164
-I be trying to make it work.
If I'm liking a guy,

37:31.165 --> 37:32.916
I'll just be like, okay,

37:32.917 --> 37:35.085
-I ain't liked nothing in a long
time, so I don't know.

37:35.086 --> 37:36.878
-Not enough.
You know, it's just...

37:36.879 --> 37:38.296
- Yeah!
- I was just wasting time.

37:38.297 --> 37:40.173
-I just feel like we all human.
Nobody's perfect.

37:40.174 --> 37:41.800
You're never gonna get
the perfect man.

37:41.801 --> 37:43.760

a whole list of...

37:51.936 --> 37:54.396
-So are you accepting
to him cheating?

37:54.397 --> 37:57.983
-I be... to be honest, I believe
in cheating respectfully.

37:57.984 --> 38:01.027
I never tell my man, like,
"Oh, you can go cheat on me."

38:01.028 --> 38:03.947
So cheating respectfully, to me,
is cheating

38:05.157 --> 38:07.659

over your other women,

is using condoms
and not having babies.

38:09.704 --> 38:12.831

because believe it or not,

38:12.832 --> 38:14.165
your man is cheating.

38:14.166 --> 38:16.751

over a one-night stand

38:16.752 --> 38:18.211

38:18.212 --> 38:20.755
I'll only leave my man
for three rea... three things.

or if you gay.

is work-out-able for me.

38:28.306 --> 38:29.681

your dicks up,

-Damn. That's crazy.

38:44.113 --> 38:46.323
-I believe that a guy can love
you and cheat on you.

38:46.324 --> 38:48.033
I'm sorry, I believe it. Guys
are built different than us.

38:48.034 --> 38:50.118
-You don't have to be sorry.
I... I've been...

38:50.119 --> 38:53.580

and you lived with Suge,

38:53.581 --> 38:55.498
that kind of came with
the territory.

38:55.499 --> 38:56.958
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm... I'm an artist,

38:56.959 --> 38:59.502
and I'm around rappers.
I-I work with these people.

38:59.503 --> 39:02.464

that's just the lifestyle.

39:02.465 --> 39:04.049

whole man list

39:12.058 --> 39:14.976
with all these requirements
of how you want your man to be

39:14.977 --> 39:17.270

cheating on you?

39:17.271 --> 39:18.730

39:18.731 --> 39:21.608
I don't think you should put
that out in the air like that.

Don't say that.
- What? What you mean?

39:23.027 --> 39:24.611
-Like, "Cheating ain't
the end-all-be-all."

39:24.612 --> 39:26.780
Don't speak that like that.
You know what I'm saying?

39:26.781 --> 39:28.782
