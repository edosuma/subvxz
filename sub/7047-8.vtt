00:01.960 --> 00:03.628
Previously on Justified...

00:03.921 --> 00:05.254
Bo Crowder's getting out of prison soon.

00:07.049 --> 00:08.758
Ava might want
to get herself out of Kentucky.

00:09.093 --> 00:12.011
I ain't leaving,
Bo Crowder notwithstanding.

00:12.096 --> 00:13.930
I tell you to do one simple thing,

00:14.014 --> 00:17.100
refrain from screwing the witness
in your own shooting,

00:17.184 --> 00:18.685
and you can't even do that!

00:18.769 --> 00:21.062
I need you to run some names.
It's about my husband.

00:21.146 --> 00:24.607
I wasn't ever thinking of shooting you,
no matter what Winona may have said.

00:24.692 --> 00:29.529
But you drag her down into any of the shit
you've got going on now, different story.

00:29.613 --> 00:33.116
David Vasquez.
I'm looking into your shootings.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.013
You all right, daughter-in-law?

00:56.223 --> 00:58.558
You look like you just walked
on your own grave.

00:58.642 --> 01:00.309
What, are you surprised to see me?

01:00.394 --> 01:02.729
I figured that Raylan...

01:02.813 --> 01:06.816
Deputy Marshal Givens
would have told you I was getting out.

01:07.109 --> 01:09.277
Especially since he's the one
that got my sentence

01:09.361 --> 01:11.112
cut by 87 days and a wake-up.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.406
What the hell are you talking about?

01:13.490 --> 01:15.199
By taking down Sheriff Hunter.

01:15.284 --> 01:17.952
All the cases that got made
by that lying son of a bitch

01:18.036 --> 01:20.371
are now liable to be reopened.

01:20.456 --> 01:23.291
So, the US Attorney decided
that anybody with a sentence

01:23.375 --> 01:26.335
less than six months wasn't worth retrying.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.796
Gave us all early release. God bless America.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.343
A little conversation.

01:35.220 --> 01:39.182
Conversation. Come on. Come on.

01:44.563 --> 01:47.774
So, what are you doing in Lexington, Bo?

01:48.484 --> 01:51.444
I figured as soon as you got out,
you'd head down to Harlan

01:51.528 --> 01:53.780
to reclaim your bullshit empire.

01:54.031 --> 01:56.949
Are you trying to hurt my feelings, girl?

01:57.576 --> 02:00.495
I'm here for you.
Since Bowman is dead and gone,

02:01.038 --> 02:03.790
I feel like you're my responsibility.

02:07.336 --> 02:09.586
How do you eat pie for dinner

02:09.670 --> 02:14.634
and still stay a bitty-little thing like you are,
with your curves in all the right places?

02:14.718 --> 02:17.720
You know, the pie we get in prison,
it's better than you might think,

02:17.805 --> 02:23.851
but it simply cannot compare to a nice,
warm, sticky piece of homemade.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.608
- Mr. Crowder.
- Well, howdy, Marshal.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.109
I sure am glad you could join us.

02:32.444 --> 02:33.903
Oh, no, no, no, no,

02:33.987 --> 02:36.531
I'm not joining you. You were just leaving.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.741
Actually, I was just telling
my daughter-in-law

02:38.826 --> 02:42.578
how the one thing that separates
the pie we get inside

02:42.663 --> 02:46.749
from a nice piece, like this one here,
is the smell.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.670
I mean, there ain't nothing
in the world like it.

02:51.797 --> 02:55.216
You know what, girl?
I think I'm gonna have to lick your plate.

02:57.427 --> 03:00.847
Are you gonna walk out of here,
or is this gonna have to go a different way?

03:01.932 --> 03:04.767
The last man
that put his hands on me like that,

03:04.852 --> 03:07.228
I beat him until his eyes bled.

03:09.648 --> 03:14.443
I guess it's a lucky thing for both of us
that I ain't a convict anymore, ain't it?

03:14.528 --> 03:19.740
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm late for a sit-down with my lawyer.

03:19.825 --> 03:22.869
- Your lawyer.
- Blue suit, red tie.

03:24.830 --> 03:27.623
- You take care of yourself now, Marshal.
- Mr. Crowder.

03:30.335 --> 03:32.712
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.803
I don't suppose now's a good time
to revisit our conversation

03:40.888 --> 03:42.555
about getting you the hell out of Kentucky?

03:44.558 --> 03:45.808
I'm not made of glass, Raylan.

03:46.602 --> 03:48.102
I mean, who's gonna bug me, anyway,

03:48.353 --> 03:51.272
when I got the A-number-one gunfighter

03:51.356 --> 03:54.525
in the whole US Marshals Service
watching my back?

03:55.152 --> 03:57.987
I'm watching every part of you.

04:38.987 --> 04:41.656
- Well, speak of the devil.
- The devil appears.

04:41.740 --> 04:44.659
Well, you were right about
Owen Carnes not offing himself.

04:44.743 --> 04:47.870
- Well, it didn't take a genius to read that one.
- Obviously.

04:47.955 --> 04:50.539
- These boys with you?
- Sorry?

04:50.832 --> 04:53.334
I thought maybe you decided
to skip over your inquiry,

04:53.418 --> 04:56.379
- haul me straight off to the clink.
- I didn't think of that.

04:57.005 --> 05:00.675
What an idiot I am.
No, this is another headache we got.

05:00.759 --> 05:03.761
- You ever hear of a Cal Wallace?
- Might ring a bell.

05:03.845 --> 05:06.806
Legendary problem inmate,
long history of non-compliance.

05:06.890 --> 05:10.434
He's here to fight a court order
to send him to Supermax.

05:10.519 --> 05:13.604
David just came by to tell us
he had a couple of other meetings today

05:13.689 --> 05:14.772
before he got to ours.

05:14.856 --> 05:17.274
Yeah, I figure they shouldn't last
more than a couple hours,

05:17.359 --> 05:19.777
and then we can have our sit-down.

05:19.861 --> 05:21.570
- End of day okay?
- Good with me.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.406
You still all right to use my office?

05:23.490 --> 05:25.908
Don't see why not. I'll give you home field.

05:26.702 --> 05:29.453
Good seeing you again, deputy. Chief.

05:31.748 --> 05:35.543
Are you planning on using a FLEO lawyer?

05:36.294 --> 05:37.378
It's just an interview.

05:37.462 --> 05:39.922
I know, but I've done
a number of these, you know.

05:40.257 --> 05:44.010
Some people have their
union lawyer present, some don't.

05:44.970 --> 05:47.972
Totally up to you.
And you don't have to decide now.

05:48.056 --> 05:51.308
Take your time, think about it.
We'll talk soon.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.982
You want a lawyer?

05:58.066 --> 06:01.068
Well, until 20 seconds ago,
I didn't think I needed one.

06:03.405 --> 06:05.322
Why don't we go over
what you're gonna say?

06:05.407 --> 06:08.325
Just make sure
that we're dotting all the T's here.

06:30.348 --> 06:33.350
Mrs. Hawkins.
I am so sorry to have startled you.

06:33.435 --> 06:36.103
I assumed Mr. Hawkins
had told you to expect me.

06:36.855 --> 06:39.190
- No.
- My name is Wynn Duffy.

06:42.194 --> 06:45.738
- Home Security Consultant.
- Mr. Hawkins didn't mention anything?

06:45.822 --> 06:48.324
- No, it must have slipped his mind.
- Well, that's not surprising,

06:48.408 --> 06:50.159
given the number of things
he must have on his mind.

06:50.577 --> 06:51.994
Safety of his family, for instance.

06:52.370 --> 06:55.039
Mrs. Hawkins,
I can offer you and your husband

06:55.123 --> 06:57.083
the kind of peace of mind
that only comes with knowing

06:57.167 --> 06:59.835
that your personal-security situation
is under control.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.213
None of which explains
what you're doing in my house.

07:02.297 --> 07:04.673
Well, ma'am,
I can't upgrade your security situation

07:04.758 --> 07:06.759
unless I first assess your security situation.

07:06.843 --> 07:08.260
- What are you doing here?
- Just because we're talking

07:08.345 --> 07:09.804
about safeguarding your physical security,

07:09.888 --> 07:12.807
doesn't mean all our solutions
will be physical.

07:12.891 --> 07:14.391
The average citizen has no idea

07:14.476 --> 07:17.269
how much the quality of their
personal security is determined

07:17.354 --> 07:18.771
by how they treat other people.

07:18.855 --> 07:20.147
Okay, I'm gonna ask you one more time...

07:20.232 --> 07:24.401
And also, if I may,
the security of their personal information.

07:24.778 --> 07:28.948
And I'm not just talking about
bank passwords or social security numbers.

07:29.032 --> 07:30.866
With one phone call, I was able to discover

07:30.951 --> 07:33.953
that the deposition you were scheduled
to work this afternoon had been canceled,

07:34.037 --> 07:38.457
letting me know that you'd be home early,
and likely be home alone.

07:39.042 --> 07:43.045
Imagine what a genuine predator would have
been able to do with that information.

07:43.547 --> 07:44.755
Or I could just call the police.

07:45.090 --> 07:46.757
The police are just a janitorial service

07:46.883 --> 07:48.759
used to clean up your blood
after you've been murdered.

07:50.387 --> 07:53.389
But if you want to trust them
to handle your security...

07:53.473 --> 07:55.975
I mean, right now.
I could call the police right now

07:56.059 --> 07:57.476
if you don't get out of my house!

07:58.103 --> 08:00.729
Mrs. Hawkins, you haven't asked me
to get out of your house.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.731
Well, I'm asking now.

08:03.400 --> 08:06.402
That's fine. I understand.

08:07.904 --> 08:11.490
Personal security can be
an emotionally-charged issue.

08:12.617 --> 08:15.953
I hope you'll let Mr. Hawkins know
I was here.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.582
Tell him I didn't forget.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.428
I got to take a dump.

08:32.761 --> 08:36.807
- You have to ask me nicely.
- I got to take a dump, please.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.143
Yeah, sure!

08:43.982 --> 08:46.483
What if he'd had somebody with him?

08:46.610 --> 08:48.527
- He didn't.
- Well, what if he did?

08:48.778 --> 08:49.862
What would you have done?

08:50.113 --> 08:51.447
What do you think I would have done?

08:51.531 --> 08:54.700
Well, I don't know, Raylan.
I don't understand you.

08:55.368 --> 08:59.163
If there was someone at the table,
Art, I wouldn't have sat down.

08:59.289 --> 09:03.459
Meaning that you were planning
to shoot him before you sat down.

09:03.793 --> 09:04.835
See what I'm trying to say?

09:04.961 --> 09:07.713
This is a spirit-of-the-law,
letter-of-the-law type of thing.

09:07.797 --> 09:09.215
Sure, the guy pulls on you first,

09:09.299 --> 09:11.634
you've got no choice to put him down,
which is fine.

09:11.718 --> 09:15.596
Unless it looks like you maneuvered him
into giving you no choice.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.432
You want me to tell Vasquez
I don't think in what-ifs.

09:18.516 --> 09:21.518
Yes. Don't let him bait you into speculating,

09:21.645 --> 09:24.855
because then you'll let your smart mouth
talk you into a jackpot.

09:26.316 --> 09:28.651
This guy, Vasquez, he may be all right,

09:28.735 --> 09:31.320
but just don't give him any more
than you have to.

09:31.404 --> 09:36.408
Just let Bucks' history as a maggot
and the fact that all these people

09:36.493 --> 09:39.328
saw him go for his piece
do your talking for you.

09:44.376 --> 09:45.584
Drop the weapon!

09:46.836 --> 09:48.170
Let him go!

09:50.215 --> 09:51.340
Put it down!

09:52.550 --> 09:53.676
Drop the weapon!

09:53.760 --> 09:55.928
- Put it down!
- Do as I say or I'll gut him!

09:56.012 --> 09:57.054
Drop the weapon!

10:01.268 --> 10:02.893
Put them on the boyfriend!

10:04.604 --> 10:05.813
What's the situation?

10:05.897 --> 10:08.816
He's got one guard down.
He's got a shiv on the other.

10:08.900 --> 10:11.360
- Any other weapons in there?
- Haven't seen any.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.861
All right, let's lower the weapons.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.364
Don't raise them again
unless I say otherwise.

10:15.448 --> 10:18.534
Let's clear this office, make sure
there's no civilians in here. And seal it.

10:18.618 --> 10:19.702
Rachel, call Washington.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.287
Tell them we need a SOG team down here.

10:32.799 --> 10:35.551
If you get a clear shot, put him down.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.765
There's still a chance to walk back
from the cliff here, Wallace.

10:42.058 --> 10:44.310
If you'll just let these men go,

10:44.602 --> 10:47.938
I'll make sure to it personally
that you don't see any retribution.

10:48.064 --> 10:51.108
And depending on the condition
of that man on the floor,

10:51.234 --> 10:52.651
I might be able to keep you out of SHU.

10:52.736 --> 10:55.195
Quit blowing smoke up my ass!

10:55.280 --> 10:57.948
Else I might have to bite the Adam's apple
of this unlucky son of a bitch

10:58.074 --> 11:00.117
to spit blood back in your face!

11:00.243 --> 11:03.245
Now, Mr. Wallace,
I'm just trying to resolve this situation

11:03.330 --> 11:08.125
before the TAC team gets here and takes
all the credit for bringing you out of there.

11:08.918 --> 11:10.419
You the shooter?

11:11.921 --> 11:16.467
They send you in here to ghost me
in case this thing goes further south?

11:17.302 --> 11:18.927
Well, the chief's a pretty good shot himself.

11:19.429 --> 11:22.097
- But you're better.
- Yep.

11:23.641 --> 11:26.352
I'll talk to you,
because you don't bullshit me!

11:26.978 --> 11:28.729
We know where each other's coming from.

11:28.813 --> 11:31.565
Plus, I've always had a problem
with authority figures.

11:31.649 --> 11:33.150
Move it back.

11:33.276 --> 11:37.738
As for you, boss man,
you can go back to your command post,

11:37.822 --> 11:39.156
have another donut!

11:42.994 --> 11:45.537
Doesn't seem to like me very much.

11:46.122 --> 11:47.956
Keep talking to him.

11:49.626 --> 11:51.293
Don't worry about Vasquez.

11:51.503 --> 11:55.047
Don't pay any attention
to that little son of a bitch. Do what I said.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.387
Mr. Vasquez, really not a good time.

12:01.471 --> 12:03.847
Chief, I thought Wallace's file
might come in handy.

12:03.973 --> 12:07.393
Rachel, see if there's anything in there
we can use.

12:07.477 --> 12:09.478
- Well, if that's everything...
- No, you wait a minute.

12:13.858 --> 12:18.487
Just to be clear, Deputy Givens is
gonna try to talk Wallace out of there.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.949
But if he's not successful,
I told him to shoot him.

12:22.033 --> 12:23.909
Those are my orders.

12:24.494 --> 12:25.786
You got me all wrong, Chief.

12:25.870 --> 12:28.330
I don't give a shit
if Deputy Givens shoots Cal Wallace.

12:29.374 --> 12:31.417
But you give a shit about
a lowlife like Tommy Bucks.

12:31.501 --> 12:35.796
No, I, like the rest of the world,
am delighted Tommy Bucks is dead.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.257
But the circumstances
didn't give you pause?

12:38.341 --> 12:39.675
Wallace?

12:46.099 --> 12:47.850
Who's the little man in the suit?

12:47.934 --> 12:50.519
He some kind of super boss man?

12:53.440 --> 12:56.358
'Cause he wasn't here when these
two hacks hauled me off to the head.

12:56.443 --> 12:57.860
You eyeball everything, huh?

12:58.027 --> 12:59.278
I do.

12:59.737 --> 13:01.613
Before you tagged in,
I noticed you looking back

13:01.698 --> 13:03.407
like you had to ask his permission.

13:03.533 --> 13:05.701
He's Assistant US Attorney.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.703
He's here investigating
a couple of my shootings.

13:08.746 --> 13:10.956
A couple of your shootings? Damn!

13:11.541 --> 13:13.542
Man, I hit the nail on the head
when I called you shooter, huh?

13:14.711 --> 13:17.296
Is that why you didn't take me at the jump?

13:17.380 --> 13:19.923
You have to resolve this situation
without drawing your weapon,

13:20.049 --> 13:21.925
prove something to the AUSA? That it?

13:22.051 --> 13:25.179
You were moving around,
dragging this poor guard around.

13:25.263 --> 13:28.891
I figured it's 50/50,
I put you down before you cut him.

13:30.101 --> 13:34.563
Besides, the point of this exercise
is everybody lives.

13:34.647 --> 13:38.066
You think you're gonna manage
to pull that off?

13:38.943 --> 13:40.152
They pay me to try.

13:42.405 --> 13:43.906
So, what now?

13:44.240 --> 13:45.949
Do you need a list of my demands?

13:46.075 --> 13:49.328
You gonna offer me a chopper,
a plane, a suitcase full of money?

13:49.662 --> 13:51.663
You want a chopper or a plane?

13:51.998 --> 13:53.290
That's... He's funny.

13:54.083 --> 13:57.002
Hey, has any numb-nuts ever fell for that?

13:57.086 --> 13:59.755
I mean, really thought he was gonna
walk out of a hostage situation,

13:59.839 --> 14:03.133
take off in a 747,
and get a hand job from a stewardess, huh?

14:03.801 --> 14:05.511
I suppose you're right.

14:05.595 --> 14:08.430
These days, the Air Force
will shoot down a passenger jet

14:08.515 --> 14:10.098
just to stop it getting taken over.

14:10.433 --> 14:12.434
Got that right. Ain't no freedom no more.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.107
So, what now? What's your play?

14:19.359 --> 14:22.778
You gonna offer to exchange yourself
for some hostages?

14:23.029 --> 14:24.154
Hell, no.

14:24.781 --> 14:30.077
I was just thinking that I'm so happy
that's not me with the shiv against my neck.

14:30.620 --> 14:32.079
How'd you get that in there, anyway?

14:32.163 --> 14:34.248
- Keistered it.
- Keistered it?

14:34.332 --> 14:37.125
Now I'm really happy not to be
the one with it up against my face.

14:42.298 --> 14:43.757
God damn it.

14:51.140 --> 14:54.434
How does that feel now?
How do you feel now?

15:12.370 --> 15:14.705
There. That more comfortable?

15:15.832 --> 15:20.168
Hey, shooter? You got much experience
with this sort of thing?

15:20.670 --> 15:24.006
- Negotiating with a barricaded suspect?
- Not really.

15:25.174 --> 15:27.009
Well, you're doing a good job so far.

15:27.135 --> 15:30.387
You have established a rapport
with the subject.

15:31.347 --> 15:33.265
But now you got to make a determination.

15:33.349 --> 15:36.852
Is the subject emotionally disturbed?

15:39.647 --> 15:42.399
- Well, you got an opinion on that?
- You seem pretty stable.

15:43.026 --> 15:45.569
Although you did spend all morning
with a shiv up your ass.

15:53.202 --> 15:55.871
Well, that leads us to the $64,000 question.

15:56.539 --> 15:58.582
Is the situation negotiable?

15:58.708 --> 16:01.501
Has the subject expressed a desire to live?

16:01.586 --> 16:04.671
Has the subject given a list of needs
and demands,

16:04.756 --> 16:07.799
and are those needs and demands
realistic and achievable?

16:07.884 --> 16:09.259
See, I've done this before, shooter.

16:09.385 --> 16:11.136
Tell me what you want, and we'll find out.

16:11.220 --> 16:12.888
Well, we got a big problem.

16:13.014 --> 16:15.891
I'm serving four consecutive life sentences,

16:16.017 --> 16:17.726
and there is no parole board
in their right mind

16:17.852 --> 16:19.227
ever gonna let me back on the street.

16:19.729 --> 16:23.649
So, as part of establishing
a rapport with the subject,

16:23.733 --> 16:27.235
am I supposed to weep with him
over all the unsympathetic parole boards

16:27.362 --> 16:32.491
who refuse to release him back into society,
when he clearly poses it no further danger?

16:32.575 --> 16:35.285
To tell you the truth,
I wouldn't put me back on the street, either.

16:35.411 --> 16:37.079
I am dangerous.

16:38.081 --> 16:40.540
I just want you to know
to stop wasting your time.

16:40.625 --> 16:43.293
I mean, you ain't got nothing
you can offer me.

16:43.419 --> 16:44.544
I understand my problem.

16:44.921 --> 16:47.214
What do I get for the man
who has everything?

16:47.298 --> 16:50.759
Well, when you figure that out, shooter,
why don't you let me know?

16:50.885 --> 16:52.260
No, no, listen. Now, wait.

16:52.387 --> 16:55.013
Now, again,
I haven't done this as much as you,

16:55.098 --> 16:57.683
but I don't think that's the way this works.

16:57.767 --> 17:00.227
Me guessing at the key to your heart.

17:00.311 --> 17:03.730
The way this works is
you tell me what you want,

17:04.147 --> 17:06.483
and I'll see if I can get it.

17:07.568 --> 17:08.944
You done?

17:16.452 --> 17:17.911
Check this out.

17:18.788 --> 17:21.540
- Who is she?
- He's got her inked on his chest.

17:21.915 --> 17:23.791
She's got to be someone special.

17:36.139 --> 17:37.764
Who's Simone?

17:41.769 --> 17:45.147
Mr. Wallace?
You want to tell me who she is?

17:45.606 --> 17:47.274
What do you know about Simone?

17:47.358 --> 17:51.778
Well, nothing. I just looked at some
photos of your tattoos.

18:05.042 --> 18:06.835
She's my daughter.

18:08.296 --> 18:09.463
Well, where is she?

18:10.465 --> 18:12.883
I don't know. With her mother, I guess.

18:13.551 --> 18:15.844
When was the last time you saw her?

18:15.970 --> 18:18.972
When she was three.
Most beautiful little girl in the world.

18:19.056 --> 18:20.974
How old is she now?

18:22.643 --> 18:23.685
Fifteen, I guess.

18:25.021 --> 18:26.521
Would you like to see her?

18:27.315 --> 18:31.193
- Could you do that?
- Well, I... We could try.

18:32.195 --> 18:34.571
You could bring her here to me?

18:35.198 --> 18:37.032
Well, Marshal, that'd be a miracle.

18:37.575 --> 18:40.202
It'd be a real miracle,
considering she don't exist.

18:40.703 --> 18:44.039
The Simone on my chest,
that's David Simone.

18:44.415 --> 18:49.211
He was an enforcer for the Wizards MC.
I killed him. He was my first.

18:50.046 --> 18:54.090
That's why I hold him dear to my heart.
But I've got no kids.

18:54.550 --> 18:57.385
At least none that I know of.
Hell, I wouldn't give a shit even if I did.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.054
We got a big problem, shooter.

18:59.555 --> 19:01.348
Sir, we're still trying to work out
the logistics.

19:01.432 --> 19:03.058
How long are you gonna
keep me on hold with this?

19:04.060 --> 19:06.686
You say you're gonna get me extra time
in the yard, a job in the kitchen.

19:06.771 --> 19:08.939
It don't matter, 'cause I won't believe it.

19:10.233 --> 19:13.276
I know, just like you know,
that I'm headed to Supermax.

19:13.402 --> 19:15.946
And I got no reason to believe
that the asshole guards at Supermax

19:16.072 --> 19:18.240
are any different than
the asshole guards right here.

19:18.741 --> 19:21.326
They enjoy turning men into animals.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.162
Don't you? Don't you enjoy it?

19:29.752 --> 19:32.754
See? They take away your toilet paper.

19:33.589 --> 19:35.799
They don't let you shower for a week.

19:35.925 --> 19:38.510
They feed you juke cakes.
You know what a juke cake is, shooter?

19:39.262 --> 19:40.971
Well, I'm guessing it's unpleasant.

19:41.097 --> 19:42.764
It's when one of these son of a bitches
takes your meal

19:42.849 --> 19:45.308
and they dump it all in a blender,
blend it together.

19:45.434 --> 19:48.019
Then they bake it in the oven
like a casserole,

19:48.104 --> 19:49.813
except they burn it black on both sides.

19:49.939 --> 19:51.523
- Then they feed it to you.
- Screwing with you.

19:51.607 --> 19:55.110
Hell, yeah, screwing with you.
Well, I screw with them, don't I?

19:55.194 --> 19:58.822
Don't I? I sit down there, and I pretend.

19:59.115 --> 20:03.618
Hell, yeah. I pretend like it's fried
chicken from Prince's Hot in Nashville,

20:03.703 --> 20:06.997
and I enjoy every finger-licking mouthful.

20:07.123 --> 20:10.542
Well, I love fried chicken.
Never had any in Nashville.

20:10.626 --> 20:12.002
They call it hot 'cause it's spicy?

20:12.128 --> 20:13.670
Hell, yeah. You take one bite of Prince's,

20:13.796 --> 20:15.547
and you start sweating
like a whore in church.

20:17.341 --> 20:18.675
Well...

20:18.801 --> 20:21.011
Well, the best fried chicken I ever had

20:21.137 --> 20:24.097
was the takeaway
at Joe's Stone Crab in Miami.

20:24.181 --> 20:25.724
Can you believe that?

20:25.808 --> 20:28.268
A Kentucky boy,
I got to go all the way down to Florida

20:28.352 --> 20:30.478
just to get my favorite.

20:30.771 --> 20:34.649
Well, I ain't never been to Florida,
so I couldn't pass judgment.

20:35.151 --> 20:36.902
But I will say this, I find it hard to believe

20:36.986 --> 20:39.654
you can get any good chicken
at a joint with "crab" in its name.

20:39.989 --> 20:42.073
That why you're doing this?

20:42.158 --> 20:43.825
Screw with the guys who screw with you?

20:44.327 --> 20:48.413
Maybe I plan on cutting the throats
of the men that screwed with me.

20:48.497 --> 20:50.749
I think if you wanted to do that,
you would have done it already.

20:51.125 --> 20:52.167
I got plenty of time.

20:55.421 --> 20:57.923
Honestly, I was looking forward
to the trip down here.

20:58.007 --> 20:59.257
I know how it's gonna turn out.

20:59.342 --> 21:02.010
I mean, I'm under no illusion about that.

21:02.136 --> 21:07.098
At least three or four days of nice scenery
on the van ride back and forth.

21:08.809 --> 21:10.810
But these two seen that it all turned to shit.

21:11.312 --> 21:12.771
Rolled me out of my bunk at 3:00 a.m.

21:12.855 --> 21:14.439
- To feed me cold eggs...
- Fifteen minutes. Got it.

21:14.523 --> 21:17.108
...drive me in a van
with no goddamn windows.

21:17.193 --> 21:18.777
I get here, they put me in a cage,

21:18.861 --> 21:21.029
and then they go about
tapping on the window,

21:21.113 --> 21:23.323
like they're screwing with
a monkey at the zoo.

21:23.407 --> 21:26.493
Well, how do you like
screwing with your monkey now, huh?

21:26.577 --> 21:28.662
- How do you like it?
- Raylan!

21:30.581 --> 21:33.375
Hey. You excuse me a sec?

21:46.055 --> 21:48.807
Closest SOG team's four hours away,
so I had to call in the locals.

21:48.891 --> 21:51.017
They're 15 minutes out. Take this ear bud.

21:51.102 --> 21:54.187
- Lexington SWAT?
- Yeah, so you know how that's gonna play.

21:54.271 --> 21:56.982
If they're like the TAC teams
I've dealt with everywhere I've been,

21:57.066 --> 21:58.900
I'm guessing they're not too big on talking.

21:58.985 --> 22:00.986
Once they get here,
there's only one way that goes.

22:01.070 --> 22:03.738
I think there's still a chance
this ends without anyone getting dead.

22:04.073 --> 22:05.281
Well, you got 15 minutes.

22:06.867 --> 22:09.160
Is there any way we can get some
fried chicken up here?

22:09.662 --> 22:11.079
- Fried chicken?
- Spicy.

22:14.083 --> 22:16.418
You think spicy fried chicken's
gonna bring him out of there?

22:16.502 --> 22:19.838
It might, if what he's looking for is a way out

22:19.922 --> 22:22.924
that doesn't require him to admit
he's scared to die.

22:26.429 --> 22:27.679
Hell, we can just give it a shot.

22:31.183 --> 22:32.434
Tim, go get some.

22:33.019 --> 22:35.812
- Anything my office can do?
- You got any money?

22:35.896 --> 22:39.107
- Wallace claims mistreatment.
- Yeah, well, it's probably true.

22:39.191 --> 22:41.735
He's a violent asshole.
You start a cycle, it's hard to stop.

22:41.819 --> 22:43.111
So, there's nothing your office can do?

22:43.320 --> 22:44.612
Probably not.

22:44.864 --> 22:47.574
Hey, for what it's worth,
if you got to put this guy down,

22:48.367 --> 22:50.076
no one from my office
is gonna second-guess you.

22:50.369 --> 22:53.121
- For what it's worth.
- Time-out on everything else.

22:56.167 --> 22:57.292
Wallace?

23:03.049 --> 23:04.466
Shooter!

23:12.183 --> 23:14.225
Don't tell me, TAC team's on its way.

23:14.310 --> 23:17.395
You got about 15 minutes
to resolve this peaceably.

23:17.938 --> 23:20.398
- You heard that?
- Well, if I didn't, I know the drill.

23:20.483 --> 23:23.068
- Did you hear I ordered some chicken?
- Fried chicken?

23:23.152 --> 23:26.529
Oh, yeah. Well, all that talk about it,
you know, got my mouth watering.

23:26.614 --> 23:28.615
If you want some,
I mean, you can come out of there.

23:28.699 --> 23:30.658
I'll share some with you.

23:30.743 --> 23:33.286
You know a box of chicken's
not gonna resolve this.

23:33.370 --> 23:35.914
- Well, I don't know.
- But I would have loved to have seen

23:35.998 --> 23:39.125
the look on your boss's face when
you told him you was ordering out lunch.

23:40.503 --> 23:41.920
Yeah. Hey.

23:43.089 --> 23:44.214
You like having a boss?

23:45.633 --> 23:47.634
Can't say I think about it much.

23:47.718 --> 23:49.094
Well, I had a boss once.

23:49.720 --> 23:53.556
I hired on rough-necking right after
I dropped out of high school.

23:53.641 --> 23:57.227
I brained my boss with a heavy chain!

23:57.311 --> 23:59.521
This one we used to trip pipe.

23:59.605 --> 24:01.773
Yeah, when I said I brained him,
I mean, literally.

24:01.857 --> 24:04.317
You could see brain
just coming out his nose.

24:05.194 --> 24:09.405
Well, but didn't you say Simone
was the first man you killed...

24:10.366 --> 24:11.741
You do that before high school?

24:11.826 --> 24:14.494
No, no, no, no. That foreman, he didn't die.

24:15.162 --> 24:19.082
I got 42 months out of it,
but that son of a bitch, he held on.

24:19.166 --> 24:23.253
I don't think he's much
of a conversationalist anymore, though.

24:26.632 --> 24:28.925
Can't remember the last time
you called me to come home early.

24:29.009 --> 24:31.553
I thought maybe your father
had had another heart attack.

24:31.637 --> 24:34.722
- Your friend was here.
- What happened?

24:36.976 --> 24:38.226
You don't want to know which friend?

24:38.894 --> 24:41.187
- Well, sorry. Who was it?
- Wynn Duffy.

24:42.648 --> 24:45.150
- Who's that?
- He said he knew you.

24:46.235 --> 24:48.486
It's not ringing any bells.

24:48.571 --> 24:50.071
Well, he was sitting right here
when I got home.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.574
- What, inside the house?
- Right here at this very counter.

24:52.908 --> 24:55.994
He said he was here to assess
our personal-security situation.

24:56.078 --> 24:58.163
Said that you had asked him
for recommendations

24:58.247 --> 24:59.831
on how to make us better protected.

24:59.915 --> 25:03.418
So, he was, what,
trying to sell you an alarm system?

25:05.421 --> 25:08.214
I don't know, Gary.
We didn't get that far. I told him to leave.

25:09.925 --> 25:13.011
He was probably a junkie
looking to make a quick score, you know?

25:13.095 --> 25:14.762
Breaks in here
'cause he sees nobody's home,

25:14.847 --> 25:18.600
and comes up with
the security-consultant thing on the fly.

25:19.101 --> 25:21.019
Junkies don't usually have business cards.

25:21.770 --> 25:24.355
Well, this is a new one.

25:24.440 --> 25:27.108
Breaking into someone's home
to get them to buy an alarm system.

25:28.861 --> 25:30.612
How long are you planning
to keep going with this?

25:32.281 --> 25:33.948
With what?
Someone's running some kind of scam.

25:34.074 --> 25:35.200
He knew our names!

25:35.284 --> 25:37.869
Well, maybe he found an old check book
or something before you came in.

25:37.953 --> 25:39.787
He knew about us! He knew where I work!

25:39.872 --> 25:41.706
Which he gets from pay stubs, or whatever.

25:41.790 --> 25:43.374
Or maybe he went through
our trash or something.

25:43.459 --> 25:44.542
- All right, yes.
- We need to get a shredder.

25:44.627 --> 25:46.711
And all of that may have
some simple explanation,

25:46.795 --> 25:50.798
but the one thing that doesn't scan
is that you're not concerned about me.

25:50.925 --> 25:52.717
About what could have happened to me.

25:54.595 --> 25:56.804
Is that what this is about?

25:59.141 --> 26:01.142
You think I don't care what happens to you?

26:01.894 --> 26:03.811
No, I know you do.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.063
And I know the reason you aren't worried

26:05.147 --> 26:07.649
about what that man
might have done to me is,

26:07.775 --> 26:12.070
you know he wasn't here for that.
Because you know what he was here for.

26:12.154 --> 26:13.905
Jesus Christ!

26:14.406 --> 26:17.325
Well, I guess the third degree's
what I deserve for marrying a Marshal's wife.

26:17.451 --> 26:19.244
You know why I didn't call the cops?

26:19.328 --> 26:21.079
'Cause I know you're into something
with some bad people,

26:21.163 --> 26:23.748
and I know that this Duffy guy,
he's one of them.

26:23.832 --> 26:25.833
How do you know something that isn't true?

26:27.419 --> 26:29.587
Because I read your emails,
and I found some names.

26:30.130 --> 26:31.256
Well, look at you.

26:31.340 --> 26:33.925
Gary, you were acting
so weird and so scared,

26:34.009 --> 26:37.428
and every time I asked you what was
going on, you would say, "Nothing."

26:37.513 --> 26:38.763
Because there's nothing going on!

26:38.847 --> 26:41.266
Gary, Wynn Duffy was
one of the names on that list!

26:41.350 --> 26:45.353
Do you know how many emails
I get each day, how many I send?

26:46.021 --> 26:47.772
Hold on.

26:48.357 --> 26:50.775
This is why your ex-husband
came to threaten me.

26:55.030 --> 26:57.782
- I asked him to run those names.
- Okay, that's enough.

26:58.158 --> 27:00.285
Can you just talk to me about
what's going on here

27:00.369 --> 27:01.536
so that we can deal with it together?

27:01.620 --> 27:04.622
I hope before our next interrogation
that you'll at least read me my rights.

27:04.707 --> 27:06.874
- Please!
- Sorry I couldn't be more help, Officer.

27:07.001 --> 27:09.043
Or should I say, Marshal?

27:14.717 --> 27:17.719
Hey. Give me 24 pieces as spicy as you got.

27:17.845 --> 27:18.970
We're closed.

27:19.054 --> 27:22.056
All right, I'm a Deputy US Marshal
ordering you to give me some chicken.

27:22.141 --> 27:23.558
- I shut down...
- What's that?

27:23.642 --> 27:25.143
- That's the last order for delivery.
- I'll take it.

27:25.561 --> 27:28.896
- Like hell you will!
- I'm officially requisitioning this chicken.

27:29.023 --> 27:31.316
If this doesn't pay for it,
send an invoice to the courthouse.

27:31.400 --> 27:32.984
But what'll I tell the customers?

27:33.068 --> 27:37.155
You tell them the US Marshal Service
is grateful for their patriotism.

27:38.907 --> 27:41.659
You know, I worked as a security guard
for a little while.

27:41.744 --> 27:45.246
Big office building in Memphis.
Daddy got me the job.

27:45.372 --> 27:47.999
He worked that outfit for 30 years,
sitting on his ass.

27:48.083 --> 27:51.836
Anybody asked him what he did,
he'd say he was in law enforcement.

27:52.713 --> 27:55.340
Well, my daddy used to grift people
out of their welfare checks.

27:55.758 --> 27:56.841
Well, that ain't right.

28:01.430 --> 28:05.391
The TAC team's here.
Looks like it's time for the fun part to begin.

28:13.108 --> 28:15.693
- Well, first off, he don't need to see.
- Copy that.

28:23.577 --> 28:25.370
Looks like they don't want me to see
what's going on.

28:25.454 --> 28:26.621
Looks like it.

28:26.705 --> 28:31.042
All right, we got windows, here and here.
We got two doors, there and there.

28:31.126 --> 28:33.461
They're simple wood.
He's got lockers blocking all of them.

28:33.587 --> 28:35.463
- Yeah, we're good. We're good.
- Okay, good.

28:35.547 --> 28:38.966
- Then we just need to wait about 10 minutes.
- For what?

28:39.468 --> 28:43.137
We're bringing something in
we think might defuse the situation.

28:44.973 --> 28:46.891
One of Wallace's complaints is food,

28:46.975 --> 28:50.061
so we thought it might be a good idea
to bring in some fried chicken.

28:50.145 --> 28:51.312
That might do the trick.

28:51.397 --> 28:53.648
You think he pulled a shiv out of his ass
'cause he wanted lunch?

28:53.732 --> 28:56.317
Well, there's also the idea that
it might be good to give him an out

28:56.443 --> 28:57.902
so that he saves face, you know?

28:57.986 --> 29:01.072
My experience, trying to appease
the bad guys just gives them an advantage.

29:01.782 --> 29:04.242
You know the Israelis don't even
talk anymore before they go tactical?

29:04.618 --> 29:06.411
Looks like it's time for you
to step off, cowboy.

29:06.495 --> 29:09.747
- No, no, no, no. I'm waiting.
- Waiting for what?

29:09.832 --> 29:12.083
What, did you find
my old grade-school English teacher?

29:12.167 --> 29:13.251
Is she with your daughter?

29:13.335 --> 29:15.169
The longer we wait, the more likely
one of my men gets hurt.

29:15.254 --> 29:17.922
Look, if you'll let my man stop you
from having to assault,

29:18.006 --> 29:19.173
- then nobody'll get hurt.
- I'm sorry, chief.

29:19.299 --> 29:20.508
Your boy's got maybe two minutes

29:20.634 --> 29:22.427
before my door-kickers are set,
and then we're going in.

29:23.679 --> 29:26.180
- They got a camera in here?
- What'd I tell you?

29:26.265 --> 29:28.850
Hold on one second.
You can't give him a few extra minutes?

29:30.853 --> 29:32.812
David Vasquez, US Attorney's Office.

29:34.189 --> 29:36.190
Look, gentlemen, due respect,

29:36.275 --> 29:37.859
whenever my men
are involved in a situation,

29:37.985 --> 29:40.278
I need full tactical command.
That's just the way it is.

29:40.362 --> 29:42.447
Of course, you got a problem with that,
give me the word,

29:42.531 --> 29:45.867
I'll get out of your hair, and you fellows
can settle this thing any way you see fit.

29:49.371 --> 29:51.122
I didn't think so.

29:51.540 --> 29:52.999
Two minutes.

29:56.545 --> 29:59.464
What? Are they all set?

30:00.007 --> 30:04.302
You want to tell me how getting
your head caved in by a TAC team

30:04.386 --> 30:06.345
helps screw with the guys
who screw with you?

30:07.181 --> 30:08.890
When they have done you
like they've done me,

30:09.558 --> 30:11.559
when you don't get to choose
when you go to bed,

30:11.643 --> 30:13.019
you don't get to choose when you eat,

30:13.353 --> 30:15.396
- when you talk, when you shit...
- See if you can find anything...

30:15.522 --> 30:17.398
...you screw with them by staying alive.
...on Lexington SWAT.

30:17.524 --> 30:18.691
Send it right to the phone.

30:18.901 --> 30:21.402
- Sounds like another reason to end this.
- Going in 90.

30:22.029 --> 30:24.238
Besides, you know damn well
I'm gonna have these boys' throats cut

30:24.323 --> 30:25.490
before they cave my head in.

30:25.574 --> 30:27.408
You try to do that, I'll kill you myself.

30:27.493 --> 30:30.411
You gonna shoot me
through a closed door on a quick draw?

30:30.537 --> 30:31.913
There ain't nobody that good.

30:32.247 --> 30:34.248
If it was easy, anybody could do it.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.668
- Sixty.
- You sure you want to be drawing

30:37.753 --> 30:40.379
your weapon when your friend,
the US Attorney, is standing nearby?

30:40.923 --> 30:42.423
You've been talking to me for a while.

30:42.925 --> 30:46.093
You think, it comes to that,
I give a shit what he thinks?

30:48.514 --> 30:49.680
Thirty.

30:50.265 --> 30:53.226
All right. You know what I read once?

30:54.228 --> 30:57.188
People in unpleasant circumstances
stay alive,

30:57.272 --> 30:59.106
not because they think things'll get better,

30:59.358 --> 31:02.026
- they want to know how the story ends.
- Twenty.

31:02.110 --> 31:05.279
- I know how my story ends.
- Put down the shiv.

31:06.532 --> 31:08.282
Live to see what I got coming for you.

31:08.367 --> 31:09.450
In 10.

31:10.536 --> 31:11.702
Give me the shiv.

31:16.750 --> 31:17.917
In five.

31:23.757 --> 31:25.132
- Hold.
- Hold. Hold.

31:25.259 --> 31:26.425
Hold.

31:28.303 --> 31:31.973
Now here we go.
Check this out, Wallace. What do we got?

31:32.140 --> 31:35.142
- Twenty-four pieces, extra spicy.
- Twenty-four pieces, extra spicy.

31:36.103 --> 31:38.813
And it looks like some greens
and some cornbread.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.064
You get some bourbon?

31:40.148 --> 31:42.567
- You didn't say shit about bourbon.
- It's in Art's office.

31:42.651 --> 31:44.277
Yeah, yeah.

31:45.320 --> 31:47.405
And how is it?

31:49.449 --> 31:52.118
Probably got tranquilizers ground up in it.

31:52.828 --> 31:54.579
Well, I hope not.

31:55.831 --> 31:58.833
No one's trying to play you
for a fool here, Wallace.

31:59.418 --> 32:03.004
Way this works, you hand me your weapon.

32:03.630 --> 32:06.340
These guys are gonna come in.
They're gonna haul you out.

32:06.425 --> 32:09.176
They won't be gentle.
Ain't nothing I can do about that.

32:09.261 --> 32:12.847
But you got, what,
three days left in your hearings?

32:13.348 --> 32:15.766
Every day you come here,
I'll get you a chicken dinner.

32:17.519 --> 32:21.772
Or whatever. You want something else?
You can sit, eat it.

32:21.857 --> 32:28.362
We could sit together, shoot the shit
like regular old human beings.

32:31.700 --> 32:34.035
I don't know if it's Prince's, but it's hot.

32:40.459 --> 32:42.001
Looky here.

32:44.379 --> 32:46.380
If that don't cool it down
and heat it up at the same time.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.051
You're gonna want a napkin.

32:58.727 --> 33:00.895
Don't touch meat with that hand,
where it's been.

33:11.406 --> 33:14.408
It ain't Prince's, but it'll do in a pinch.

33:16.036 --> 33:17.745
Don't suppose I can get a shot
of that bourbon?

33:17.829 --> 33:20.581
Well, two cups aren't just for me.

33:36.515 --> 33:39.058
We got him.
Down on the floor!

33:39.601 --> 33:40.935
Stay down.

33:44.189 --> 33:47.108
Gentlemen, to bumps, to bruises,

33:47.234 --> 33:50.444
and a couple of cracked ribs,
and no one dead.

33:53.740 --> 33:56.075
I think the bourbon sealed it.

33:56.284 --> 33:58.119
You must be glad to finally find
a professional use

33:58.245 --> 33:59.870
for your office bottle, huh, Chief?

33:59.955 --> 34:01.706
Well, I don't know what you're talking about.

34:01.790 --> 34:05.292
I was just as surprised to find that in here
as anybody else.

34:05.377 --> 34:06.877
It was probably the cleaning staff that left it.

34:06.962 --> 34:08.295
Yeah. Teenagers.

34:08.547 --> 34:10.380
Hopped-up kids on a joyride to hell.

34:10.465 --> 34:11.716
Hope I'm not interrupting.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.801
No, no. We can find another glass.

34:14.136 --> 34:15.302
Some other time.

34:15.387 --> 34:16.971
I want to thank you for holding up.

34:17.139 --> 34:19.806
Your AUSA friend there is pretty persuasive.

34:21.893 --> 34:24.478
I got to ask you.
Is that true what you said about the Israelis?

34:24.603 --> 34:26.480
It's true I said it.

34:27.107 --> 34:30.735
Listen, I'm happy anytime
a situation gets resolved peacefully,

34:30.819 --> 34:33.987
but the next time, I'd appreciate it
if you guys just got out of the way

34:34.114 --> 34:35.656
and let me and my men do our job.

34:35.782 --> 34:38.826
Well, if this ever happens again,
it means that I really suck at my job.

34:43.581 --> 34:45.248
What'd you tell that asshole?

34:45.333 --> 34:48.835
I said I hoped the lawsuit against
his department didn't go federal.

34:48.962 --> 34:51.422
- What lawsuit?
- Damned if I know.

34:51.672 --> 34:53.841
I checked with my office.
They didn't get back to me in time.

34:53.967 --> 34:57.094
I figured there's always some kind
of lawsuit against a department, right?

34:57.179 --> 34:59.180
- Worth a shot.
- That's good.

35:00.307 --> 35:02.641
Hey, when's our time-out up?

35:05.937 --> 35:07.188
You know what?
We don't have to do this today.

35:07.272 --> 35:09.523
Not a bad idea.
Why don't you take a rain check?

35:09.608 --> 35:11.192
Just as soon get to it.

35:11.651 --> 35:13.694
You know, get it over with.

35:17.073 --> 35:20.701
No, no, that's fine.
Okay. Let me get my briefcase.

35:24.915 --> 35:28.209
Well, I got to say it.
I owe you one on this one.

35:29.044 --> 35:31.629
I mean, this could've gone
a whole other way.

35:31.713 --> 35:36.258
A violent hostage situation
inside the Marshals' Office? Let's...

35:36.384 --> 35:37.468
Other way.

35:37.552 --> 35:40.721
Let's just say it could've been
a real black eye.

35:40.847 --> 35:42.807
You managed to end this so quietly,

35:42.891 --> 35:44.809
I don't even think it's gonna make
the papers.

35:44.893 --> 35:49.230
My sole purpose, my guiding principle,
was to protect your reputation.

35:49.898 --> 35:51.732
And I appreciate it.

35:54.069 --> 35:55.736
Now, remember.

35:57.781 --> 36:00.366
No what-ifs, no would-haves, just...

36:00.784 --> 36:02.409
- Just the facts, ma'am.
- Yes.

36:02.911 --> 36:06.455
Deputy Marshal Raylan Givens,
initial post-shooting interview.

36:06.581 --> 36:09.416
Also present, Chief Deputy Art Mullen.

36:11.545 --> 36:14.421
Deputy Givens, how would you characterize
your relationship with Ava Crowder?

36:33.900 --> 36:36.068
- Where'd you get those?
- Does it matter?

36:36.152 --> 36:38.320
One of your meetings today
with Bo Crowder and his lawyer?

36:39.990 --> 36:45.077
Whatever's going on with Ava and I,
a jury's gonna take our word over Boyd's.

36:45.161 --> 36:46.495
Do you honestly not see
what Boyd Crowder's

36:46.621 --> 36:47.913
attorney's gonna put together from these?

36:47.998 --> 36:51.041
I'll tell you the story.
The day before you ride back into town,

36:51.126 --> 36:54.920
Ava Crowder decides to ventilate her
husband with a hunting rifle, okay?

36:55.005 --> 36:56.881
A few days after that, she stands by,

36:56.965 --> 36:59.717
holding a Marshals' Service shotgun...
I believe that that's right.

36:59.801 --> 37:02.428
While you shoot Boyd Crowder
in the very same house

37:02.512 --> 37:05.097
in the same room, on the same
goddamn chair where his brother died.

37:06.141 --> 37:11.645
He will strongly suggest you began
your relationship before your reassignment.

37:12.981 --> 37:15.941
No, he will, and you know what that means?

37:17.027 --> 37:18.819
- We're gonna have to release Boyd Crowder.
- Release him?

37:18.945 --> 37:20.404
- What?
- Yes. Yes, because I...

37:20.488 --> 37:21.739
- Come on.
- Listen to me.

37:21.823 --> 37:25.409
I don't have evidence that links him
to any of the bank robberies.

37:25.493 --> 37:29.622
And the witness that we had from
the church bombing failed to identify him.

37:29.873 --> 37:30.998
So now what?

37:31.124 --> 37:33.292
So you get one of his guys
to flip on the banks.

37:33.376 --> 37:35.628
Considering the life expectancy
of a federal inmate

37:35.712 --> 37:37.254
who snitches on
an Aryan Underground leader,

37:37.339 --> 37:38.505
I wouldn't hold my breath, Chief.

37:38.632 --> 37:41.050
Which means the only viable charges
that we have against him

37:41.176 --> 37:42.509
are the kidnapping of Ava Crowder,

37:42.636 --> 37:44.845
and the attempted murder
of a federal officer.

37:44.971 --> 37:47.473
Good charges, good charges,
except that they're both predicated

37:47.557 --> 37:50.225
upon the testimony
of Ms. Crowder and yourself.

37:50.352 --> 37:52.519
And now that you both have been
compromised as witnesses,

37:52.646 --> 37:54.438
who's to say that Boyd Crowder

37:54.522 --> 37:56.899
didn't go to his sister-in-law's house
that night for anything

37:57.025 --> 37:58.692
other than a little fried chicken?

37:59.694 --> 38:04.365
What happens now?

38:05.033 --> 38:11.163
Boyd Crowder pleads to a minor gun charge,
gets sentenced to time served, and he walks.

38:12.707 --> 38:16.085
And we pray that he doesn't decide to sue.

38:24.719 --> 38:28.889
You want my advice?
Just stay the hell away from Boyd Crowder.

38:30.350 --> 38:31.892
Stay away from her, too.

38:40.235 --> 38:43.612
Have you come back
to welcome me into free society?

38:44.114 --> 38:46.031
That's awful white of you, Raylan.

38:46.116 --> 38:49.952
I thought you left all that
master-race bullshit behind you.

38:50.078 --> 38:52.037
It's just an innocuous expression.

38:52.122 --> 38:56.041
It has nothing to do with skin,
much like "It's a black thing."

38:57.085 --> 38:58.585
Yeah.

39:00.088 --> 39:03.716
You know, while we're on the subject
of your conversion,

39:05.093 --> 39:07.594
- I have a question.
- Well, I'm glad to hear that.

39:07.721 --> 39:09.847
Seeking is the goal,
and the search is the answer.

39:09.931 --> 39:14.685
Yeah, the question is
why would the born-again Boyd Crowder

39:14.769 --> 39:19.565
allow himself to be released unjustly without
having to do penance for his crimes?

39:20.108 --> 39:22.443
Well, I myself have struggled
with this very question

39:22.569 --> 39:27.239
until I realized that this turn of events
is nothing short of a miracle.

39:28.116 --> 39:31.118
It's God's will that I walk free, and who am I?

39:32.120 --> 39:34.955
Who are any of us to fight the will of God?

39:35.290 --> 39:39.501
Now, my ministry has gone as far as
it can behind these prison walls.

39:39.627 --> 39:42.129
As much as it pains me to say this,

39:42.255 --> 39:45.799
there are men's souls in there
that are simply beyond my power to save.

39:45.925 --> 39:47.259
I'll bet.

39:47.343 --> 39:51.513
Now, my mission now is to cast off
the shackles of my incarceration,

39:51.639 --> 39:54.683
to go forth in the land,
and spread His good word,

39:54.809 --> 39:56.852
the way that Jesus did with the apostles.

39:56.978 --> 40:00.773
No, no, of course, yeah.
It's funny, I don't see the miracle.

40:00.857 --> 40:02.858
See, the way I see it,

40:03.610 --> 40:07.613
I'm the one who allowed you to be
unleashed upon the world,

40:07.697 --> 40:11.075
like I'm the one who's gonna find a way
to put you back in a cage.

40:11.159 --> 40:12.618
Well, I hope you understand, Raylan,

40:12.702 --> 40:15.079
I can't let anything stand in the way
of my divine calling.

40:15.163 --> 40:18.499
- Good luck with that.
- No luck needed. Hello, Daddy!

40:19.042 --> 40:20.167
Oh, my.

40:21.836 --> 40:24.171
What's it gonna be like,
the first bank you see

40:24.297 --> 40:27.091
with questionable security,
a good getaway route?

40:27.175 --> 40:29.134
You gonna be able to resist that temptation?

40:29.219 --> 40:31.470
Not a lot of temptation inside.

40:31.554 --> 40:33.889
You know, you haven't believed
a word I've said.

40:34.474 --> 40:38.310
You think all my talk of God
is just me working some angle.

40:38.394 --> 40:43.899
All I know for sure is you robbed banks,
and you blew shit up,

40:44.025 --> 40:46.110
and you murdered at least one man.

40:46.194 --> 40:48.195
You remember Jared, right?

40:48.321 --> 40:52.241
Guy you shot in the back of the head
on Tates Creek Bridge?

40:53.034 --> 40:56.620
I must leave you now, Raylan,
to be restored to the bosom of my family.

40:56.704 --> 40:57.871
Well...

40:57.997 --> 41:02.376
I will continue to pray that someday
I might bring you a modicum of peace.

41:02.502 --> 41:04.211
I appreciate that.

41:10.760 --> 41:12.886
Good to see you, Daddy.
