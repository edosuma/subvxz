WEBVTT

00:02.302 --> 00:05.704
Sweet, sweet Molly,
you will be mine.

00:05.706 --> 00:08.207
D-d-d-d-doo-doo, doo-doo.

00:09.009 --> 00:11.310
Peekaboo.

00:11.312 --> 00:11.744
Carol.

00:11.746 --> 00:14.346
Which one of these dudes
would you want to ask you out?

00:14.348 --> 00:15.180
Okay.
Chris Rock?

00:15.182 --> 00:18.350
Let a black man
take you out on a date!

00:18.352 --> 00:20.386
Tired, tired,
tired, tired, tired!

00:20.388 --> 00:22.654
Captain's log, star date...

00:22.656 --> 00:25.224
This evening.
I want to...

00:25.226 --> 00:26.992
take you where
no woman has gone before.

00:26.994 --> 00:30.095
Good evening.
I'm Morgan Freeman.

00:30.097 --> 00:32.664
I can be your father,

00:32.666 --> 00:34.166
your daddy,
whatever you need me to be.

00:34.168 --> 00:37.403
Um, you could be
my Miss Piggy

00:37.405 --> 00:38.771
if you want to.

00:38.773 --> 00:39.471
Just be yourself.

00:39.473 --> 00:42.307
That's how I land
all my bone buddies.

00:42.309 --> 00:45.411
Gross to know.
Thanks for the advice.

00:45.413 --> 00:47.579
I guess I'll be myself...

00:47.581 --> 00:49.882
Or Denzel Washington.

00:49.884 --> 00:51.450
Hey.

00:51.452 --> 00:55.254
Okay, Molly, okay.

00:55.256 --> 00:57.589
- Oh.
- You know what? Uh...

00:57.591 --> 00:59.458
Um, sorry.

00:59.460 --> 01:02.828
Cash, did you, uh,
did you need something?

01:02.830 --> 01:04.296
Uh...

01:04.831 --> 01:07.132
Are you into tagging?

01:07.134 --> 01:07.766
Excuse me?

01:07.768 --> 01:11.236
I was thinking maybe
we can go sometime.

01:11.238 --> 01:12.805
Game on, girl.

01:14.742 --> 01:17.376
Oh, laser tag.
The game where children

01:17.378 --> 01:19.511
run around after each other
with flashlights.

01:19.513 --> 01:24.016
It's not quite my cup of tea,
but thank you, anyway.

01:24.018 --> 01:27.319
Okay. All right. Heh.

01:27.321 --> 01:30.055
Seems someone's got a hankering
for an English muffin, huh?

01:30.057 --> 01:33.859
Yeah, I mean, every time
I ask her out, it's just...

01:36.230 --> 01:39.631
Well, maybe if you found
a common interest with her...

01:39.633 --> 01:41.233
But that's why I asked her
to go laser tagging.

01:41.235 --> 01:44.169
It's historically the world's
greatest crossover activity.

01:44.171 --> 01:45.237
Let me stop you
right there.

01:45.239 --> 01:48.207
Laser tag is the world's
greatest nothing.

01:48.374 --> 01:50.242
Oh!

01:50.310 --> 01:51.477
Gotcha.

01:52.146 --> 01:54.913
What? Really?
A T-shirt launcher?

01:54.915 --> 01:56.482
Come on.
Those things are for stadiums.

01:56.484 --> 01:59.685
That's to get you fired up,
'cause I've got news!

01:59.687 --> 02:03.021
You, sir, have been
hand-selected... What?

02:03.023 --> 02:07.593
To join me at the O.C.P.
Leadership Conference

02:07.595 --> 02:09.995
in San Diego
this weekend.

02:09.997 --> 02:12.064
Am I being punished
or something?

02:12.066 --> 02:15.434
No, no, I see big things
in your future,

02:15.436 --> 02:20.305
like some sweet
O.C.P. swag.

02:20.406 --> 02:21.173
You're taking Cameron

02:21.175 --> 02:24.510
to the O.C.P. Leadership
Conference? Really?

02:24.512 --> 02:25.210
Him? No offense.

02:25.212 --> 02:27.379
Uh, much taken.
You know what, Veronica?

02:27.381 --> 02:30.716
I'd be honored to go with you
to the O.C.P. Conference

02:30.718 --> 02:34.486
and to wear
my new O.C.P. T-shirt...

02:34.488 --> 02:36.755
Or nightgown.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.056
Man gown.

02:38.058 --> 02:40.159
Look at where we're staying
for the O.C.P. Conference.

02:40.161 --> 02:41.927
I mean, they've got
air conditioning,

02:41.929 --> 02:44.630
an ice machine,
free mini shampoos...

02:44.632 --> 02:47.366
Oh, wow.
So it's like a hotel.

02:47.368 --> 02:48.600
You have to know
Vee only picked you

02:48.602 --> 02:51.203
because she wants to play grab-ass
with your man muffins.

02:51.205 --> 02:53.972
Maybe she invited me
to a leadership conference

02:53.974 --> 02:54.973
because she thinks
I'm a leader.

02:54.975 --> 02:57.242
Nah. She picked Cammy
for his sweet hammy.

02:57.244 --> 03:02.681
He's right. You know Vee's got a
long history of sexual harassment.

03:04.751 --> 03:05.317
Hey there.

03:05.319 --> 03:08.153
Have you heard that
new song by The Police,

03:08.155 --> 03:10.989
<i>Please Stand Really,</i>
<i>Really Close To Me?</i>

03:10.991 --> 03:12.224
I don't think
that's how it goes.

03:12.226 --> 03:15.160
Shut up and take off
those Z. Cavariccis.

03:15.162 --> 03:17.629
This is big for me.
I mean, isn't it possible

03:17.631 --> 03:19.698
that she sees something in me
just like you did?

03:19.700 --> 03:21.600
Nope. She wants
to bang you.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.869
Come on. That's...

03:23.871 --> 03:25.737
Bang, bang!

03:25.905 --> 03:27.239
Oh, yeah.

03:43.723 --> 03:46.425
<i>♪ We got your back</i>

03:50.330 --> 03:52.931
Boom. Took your advice.

03:52.933 --> 03:54.066
Since Molly
doesn't like laser tag,

03:54.068 --> 03:58.237
I'm asking her to the planetarium
laser light show.

03:58.239 --> 04:01.974
I got a question for you,
and I really want you to think about this.

04:01.976 --> 04:04.610
Why is it that all your dates
involve lasers?

04:04.612 --> 04:07.546
Bye, kids. Don't do
anything I wouldn't do.

04:07.548 --> 04:11.016
So long, Camsy!
Don't do anyone I wouldn't do!

04:11.018 --> 04:12.985
I'm a leader!

04:13.219 --> 04:13.885
Don't worry, Vee!

04:13.887 --> 04:16.021
With Molly in charge,
this weekend,

04:16.023 --> 04:17.856
the office is
in good hands.

04:17.858 --> 04:18.490
Oh. Thank you, Oz.

04:18.492 --> 04:22.127
Well, we look forward
to respecting your authority, Molly.

04:22.962 --> 04:24.363
Good.

04:25.298 --> 04:27.099
You, me...

04:27.101 --> 04:27.699
Secret mission.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.134
I thought
you'd never ask.

04:29.136 --> 04:32.604
That is Sean Hurley.
You may remember his late father Hugo.

04:32.606 --> 04:35.140
He was our night janitor
for 15 years.

04:35.142 --> 04:39.344
Oh. The old racist guy?
I loved him. Mmm.

04:39.346 --> 04:39.978
It was not mutual.

04:39.980 --> 04:43.148
He was an eccentric old bastard,
but that's why I'm here.

04:43.150 --> 04:45.083
I found this
in his safety deposit box.

04:45.085 --> 04:48.186
"Hurley's Gold"?
That's a map of our office.

04:48.188 --> 04:49.087
Sean feels
that his father

04:49.089 --> 04:50.789
may have hid his fortune
somewhere here in Contra

04:50.791 --> 04:53.759
so his four ex-wives
couldn't get a hold of it.

04:53.761 --> 04:55.394
Buried treasure?
Mmm.

04:55.396 --> 04:56.061
Buried treasure?

04:56.063 --> 04:58.263
We'll dig this weekend,
while the office is empty.

04:58.265 --> 05:03.068
Aye. We'll find your
dead father's gold. Argh.

05:03.070 --> 05:04.503
Cash.

05:04.604 --> 05:06.638
Really sorry for your loss.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.508
<i>- Hey. Cameron Crowe.</i>
<i>- What's the good word?</i>

05:09.510 --> 05:10.208
Just calling to gloat.

05:10.210 --> 05:13.679
I'm at the hotel, in my own room,
enjoying $12 peanuts.

05:13.681 --> 05:17.115
What's on tap next?
Perhaps erotic cinema on demand?

05:17.117 --> 05:19.785
Looks like the only one
manhandling me is me.

05:19.787 --> 05:22.321
<i>I don't think that's</i>
<i>the win you think it is.</i>

05:22.323 --> 05:25.991
Howdy, neighbor!
What you got under that robe?

05:25.993 --> 05:27.726
Wow. You're here
in my room.

05:27.728 --> 05:30.128
Look at this.
It's the intimacy pack.

05:30.130 --> 05:31.930
It's like office supplies
for hookers.

05:31.932 --> 05:35.367
So we've got a couple hours to kill.
What do you want to do?

05:36.637 --> 05:38.103
<i>I'm never wrong.</i>

05:38.105 --> 05:39.905
Yeah.

05:43.276 --> 05:46.278
Get in there!

05:46.280 --> 05:48.647
Find that treasure!

05:48.649 --> 05:50.449
Cash!
Uh-oh.

05:50.451 --> 05:51.216
Cash!

05:52.319 --> 05:53.952
Hey. 'Sup, Molly?

05:53.954 --> 05:54.953
Veronica puts me
in charge,

05:54.955 --> 05:59.191
and that's when you decide
to destroy the entire office?

05:59.193 --> 05:59.825
Don't be mad.

05:59.827 --> 06:03.462
I... I have a perfectly
reasonable explanation for all this.

06:03.464 --> 06:04.896
Searching for
buried treasure.

06:04.898 --> 06:08.300
Hey! Look!
X marks the spot!

06:12.172 --> 06:15.807
Well, guess we should,
uh, ask your permission

06:15.809 --> 06:18.343
before we open the treasure.
Eh, boss lady?

06:18.345 --> 06:20.445
Well, I suppose
the damage is already done.

06:20.447 --> 06:22.614
May as well
take a peek, eh?

06:22.616 --> 06:25.050
Okay.
Candy bar wrapper?

06:25.052 --> 06:29.521
Oh, man. That's the worst ending
with a rapper since Tupac.

06:29.523 --> 06:31.990
Oh, wait. There's writing
on the other side.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.058
I think it's a clue.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.559
Actually,
I'm not quite sure about all this.

06:34.561 --> 06:38.530
Come on! You're a perfect addition to
our treasure-hunting team.

06:38.532 --> 06:42.167
I mean, the way you handle
those crosswords and Suduki...

06:42.169 --> 06:43.101
You noticed?
Yeah.

06:43.103 --> 06:47.072
Oh. Well, I suppose
I could help out a little bit.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.274
Yes! Just like
<i>National Treasure.</i>

06:49.276 --> 06:51.443
The hot blonde,
the badass treasure hunter,

06:51.445 --> 06:55.180
and the not-so-comic
sidekick.

06:57.418 --> 06:58.116
Yeah, point taken.

06:58.118 --> 07:01.086
"Nails in my belly,
trees in my spine,

07:01.088 --> 07:04.756
"if I swallow water, I shall not be fine."
Hang on.

07:04.758 --> 07:09.461
"Nails in my belly,
trees in my spine..."

07:09.996 --> 07:12.297
It's a boat! Look.

07:12.365 --> 07:14.833
The ship...

07:14.835 --> 07:16.501
It's called  <i>Destino.</i>

07:16.503 --> 07:19.337
That means "fate"
in Spanish.

07:19.339 --> 07:22.007
Cash! Good work.

07:22.108 --> 07:22.941
<i>Gracias.</i>

07:22.943 --> 07:23.809
So "fate." What next?

07:23.811 --> 07:26.077
Well, why don't we take
a little snacky break

07:26.079 --> 07:30.715
and eat some
Cheez Doodles? "G-7."

07:30.917 --> 07:31.850
Wait!

07:31.852 --> 07:35.253
"Fate." "F-8."

07:38.358 --> 07:40.659
Look. It's our next clue.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.794
That's my girl.
Wow.

07:42.796 --> 07:43.862
Not like
you're my girl.

07:43.864 --> 07:48.433
I'm just... That'd be crazy,
right? I mean...

07:51.871 --> 07:52.971
Hi. Hi there. Hi.
Oh, hi.

07:52.973 --> 07:55.707
Um, I was wondering
if you could maybe move me.

07:55.709 --> 07:58.376
I have a really annoying neighbor
in the adjoining room.

07:58.378 --> 08:01.346
I'm pretty sure
she's smoking the drugs.

08:01.348 --> 08:01.847
Oh, I'm sorry,

08:01.849 --> 08:03.381
but we're completely booked
for the convention.

08:03.383 --> 08:06.184
Right, right.
The O.C.P. Convention.

08:06.186 --> 08:07.185
"O.C.P."? No.

08:07.187 --> 08:10.589
Oh, you must mean
the Shoe Retailer's Association.

08:10.756 --> 08:11.656
What?

08:11.658 --> 08:13.825
Shoozapalooza.

08:16.863 --> 08:18.597
"Shoozapalooza"?

08:18.599 --> 08:21.733
It's my favorite
"palooza."

08:21.735 --> 08:23.101
<i>There's no O.C.P. Convention.</i>
<i>You were right.</i>

08:23.103 --> 08:25.704
<i>She totally wants my man muffins.</i>
<i>What do I do?</i>

08:25.706 --> 08:26.505
<i>Hang in there?</i>

08:26.507 --> 08:28.640
What? That's it?
That's all you have for me?

08:28.642 --> 08:31.676
<i>Well, I guess it's better</i>
<i>than "I told you so, slut."</i>

08:32.980 --> 08:34.246
Hi, leader.

08:34.248 --> 08:35.747
Please knock
if you're gonna do that.

08:35.749 --> 08:37.115
It's just common
neighbor courtesy.

08:37.117 --> 08:40.652
I can't have the future of O.C.P.
looking like a kid.

08:40.654 --> 08:43.255
Wha... So I went out and
got you this old thing.

08:43.257 --> 08:45.490
I'm worried about this inseam.
Wait a second.

08:45.492 --> 08:47.392
No. If I give it
a little tug...

08:47.394 --> 08:49.294
You don't need to tug.
Yeah, no big D.

08:49.296 --> 08:52.063
<i>She wants the big D,</i>
<i>all right.</i>

08:54.001 --> 08:55.667
Hey, Tango and Cash,
you figure out

08:55.669 --> 08:57.068
what those numbers
on the vending machine mean?

08:57.070 --> 08:59.437
Yes. We suspect they're GPS coordinates.
Ooh.

08:59.439 --> 09:03.408
And they're leading me
right towards...

09:04.144 --> 09:07.345
Veronica's desk...
Just like  <i>National Treasure.</i>

09:07.347 --> 09:09.247
Okay, we're looking
for a secret panel

09:09.249 --> 09:13.251
or some type of knob
or something to twist or push.

09:15.022 --> 09:17.455
You know, if somebody
had told me this morning

09:17.457 --> 09:20.725
I'd be under a desk helping
you and Oz look for gold,

09:20.727 --> 09:23.895
I'd have said
they were bonkers, but...

09:24.130 --> 09:26.965
I'm having
a really good time.

09:27.266 --> 09:28.366
We make
a pretty good team.

09:28.368 --> 09:32.437
We really do.
Can I confide something in you?

09:32.439 --> 09:33.171
Cash...
Molly...

09:33.173 --> 09:36.441
Sorry. You go first.
No. What were you gonna say?

09:36.443 --> 09:39.544
I like Oz. I like you...
Niversity of Phoenix.

09:39.546 --> 09:43.248
I'm, um... Just needed
to get that off my chest.

09:43.250 --> 09:46.618
Thanks for listening.
You're a good friend.

09:46.620 --> 09:48.320
I'm sorry. What...
What were you gonna say?

09:48.322 --> 09:53.825
Uh, I was just extolling the virtues
of an online degree.

09:53.893 --> 09:54.225
Oh.

09:54.227 --> 09:57.495
All right.
Ow. Damn it, desk.

09:57.497 --> 09:58.863
Cash!

09:58.865 --> 10:00.799
Another clue!

10:04.937 --> 10:06.805
Don't even.

10:13.546 --> 10:14.145
My mom was so proud

10:14.147 --> 10:16.448
that you asked me
to this O.C.P. Conference... Oh.

10:16.450 --> 10:19.050
And recognized
my leadership potential.

10:19.052 --> 10:22.320
Okay.
So you figured it out.

10:22.322 --> 10:24.923
Yes! Yes! I know
there's no conference!

10:24.925 --> 10:26.791
I know you got us
adjoining rooms,

10:26.793 --> 10:27.993
and I know
you dressed me up...

10:27.995 --> 10:29.361
Like your
little sex puppet.

10:29.363 --> 10:32.597
Cameron, I am old enough
to be your sister.

10:32.599 --> 10:36.301
Hey. How much longer
is going to take?

10:36.969 --> 10:38.570
This costume
is balls hot,

10:38.572 --> 10:40.071
and I got a convention
to star in.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.206
Shut up, Shoe.

10:41.208 --> 10:44.209
Stay out of it, Shoe.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.076
Aah.

10:45.078 --> 10:45.977
Oh.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.980
This is it. Oh, hey.

10:49.248 --> 10:50.849
Oh.
Aah!

10:50.851 --> 10:53.785
A wedding?
What's happening?

10:53.787 --> 10:55.220
I might be
in a giant shoe,

10:55.222 --> 10:59.024
but even I can see
you're arm candy, bro.

10:59.892 --> 11:03.995
Oh, look. This is my boyfriend.
Boo bear. Boo-boo bunny.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.431
No, no, don't... I'm...
That's my boyfriend. He's so capricious.

11:06.433 --> 11:07.966
Don't call me your boo bear.
Yeah. Uh...

11:07.968 --> 11:09.734
I'm not your boo bear
or your boo bunny or whatever.

11:09.736 --> 11:12.103
I don't know what's going on,
but just count me out.

11:12.105 --> 11:16.508
Oh, for the love of Ray J,
I'm gonna come clean. Listen.

11:16.510 --> 11:18.476
One of my favorite
ex-husbands is gonna be

11:18.478 --> 11:22.580
at this thing tonight
with his hot, young, new girlfriend...

11:22.582 --> 11:24.983
and I didn't want to get stuck
at the singles table.

11:24.985 --> 11:27.318
But... But still, you lied
and you made me think

11:27.320 --> 11:30.321
I was the future of...
Oh, my God. Sliders.

11:30.323 --> 11:32.057
No. No. Forget sliders.
That's how mad I am.

11:32.059 --> 11:35.994
Cameron, I knew that you never would
come to this if I told you the truth,

11:35.996 --> 11:39.330
so please, can't you just
do me this one solid?

11:39.332 --> 11:40.598
I mean, we're friends.

11:40.600 --> 11:41.633
No. No, we're not friends.

11:41.635 --> 11:44.803
You're just my crazy,
manipulative boss.

11:47.673 --> 11:50.175
Well, hello, Veronica.

11:50.177 --> 11:52.077
How's my house
and my dog?

11:52.079 --> 11:56.214
Oh, they're great,
and your daughter is fine, too.

11:56.216 --> 11:59.117
Let me introduce you to
my girlfriend. This is...

11:59.119 --> 12:00.685
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Let me guess.

12:00.687 --> 12:04.489
It's either a flower,
a spice, or a car.

12:04.491 --> 12:05.090
Jasmine.

12:05.092 --> 12:07.992
Oh! Two out of three.
This is my lucky day.

12:07.994 --> 12:09.494
We just celebrated
her birthday

12:09.496 --> 12:12.530
by taking the old yacht
down to the Bahamas.

12:12.532 --> 12:15.400
It was the big 2-2.

12:15.601 --> 12:18.036
She was born
in the '90s.

12:18.038 --> 12:23.475
So where's your plus one?
Or are you plus none?

12:23.477 --> 12:25.777
I'm right here.
How you doing?

12:25.779 --> 12:30.048
I'm Cam, her lover.
I also have a boat.

12:30.149 --> 12:32.217
And a cool...

12:32.885 --> 12:34.018
Other boat.

12:34.020 --> 12:35.854
Two boats.
Deuce.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.055
Should we go
grab a drink...

12:37.057 --> 12:37.889
Oh, yeah.
Honey face?

12:37.891 --> 12:40.391
Yeah. Honey...
Bunches of oats?

12:40.393 --> 12:42.160
That's my nickname.
Smart start.

12:42.162 --> 12:46.030
Yeah, we like to have sex
on the breakfast table.

12:46.032 --> 12:48.233
Cheerios.
Yeah. Yeah.

12:48.235 --> 12:50.935
Hey! There you are, captain.
What gives? Come on.

12:50.937 --> 12:54.239
We're so close to finding
the gold. Don't quit now.

12:54.241 --> 12:54.873
Go away, traitor.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.108
Does your current behavior
have something to do with Molly?

12:57.110 --> 13:00.311
'Cause listen, I would never go
after a girl that you liked.

13:00.313 --> 13:02.013
You're like
a kid brother to me.

13:02.015 --> 13:04.582
A brother has your back.
He's there for you.

13:04.584 --> 13:05.450
Like in  <i>National Treasure,</i>

13:05.452 --> 13:06.785
the unfunny guy
from  <i>The Hangover</i>

13:06.787 --> 13:09.320
helped Nic Cage get the chick
from  <i>Inglourious Basterds?</i>

13:09.322 --> 13:11.256
That's a brother.
Right, right, right.

13:11.258 --> 13:14.225
Sort of like how a brother might
orchestrate a phony treasure hunt

13:14.227 --> 13:18.530
so said brother could bond with the girl
that he has a crush on?

13:18.532 --> 13:19.664
Yeah, that would
have been cool.

13:19.666 --> 13:21.766
Instead, I'm stuck in this
extremely real treasure hunt,

13:21.768 --> 13:23.968
looking for a dead janitor's
hidden fortune.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.837
You know, for a smart guy,
you can be a real dumb-ass.

13:25.839 --> 13:29.707
Look, there is no gold.
I set the whole thing up.

13:29.709 --> 13:30.508
What?
Yeah.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.811
No. We had a meeting.
I met Hurley's son.

13:32.813 --> 13:33.444
No.

13:33.446 --> 13:36.080
You got an honest face.
You ever done any acting?

13:36.082 --> 13:39.050
Puzzles seemed to be the one thing
that you and Molly

13:39.052 --> 13:40.451
had in common,
so I ran with it,

13:40.453 --> 13:42.453
and damn it,
it was working, man.

13:42.455 --> 13:43.621
We hugged.
Yeah.

13:43.623 --> 13:45.056
She smelled like
strawberries and sunshine

13:45.058 --> 13:50.061
and superhero figurines
wrapped in their original packaging.

13:50.063 --> 13:51.396
Point is,
you got to impress her.

13:51.398 --> 13:53.832
Just keep showing her
what you're good at.

13:53.834 --> 13:54.999
Oh.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.868
Like close-up magic,

13:56.870 --> 13:58.903
the world's greatest
aphrodisiac.

13:58.905 --> 13:59.604
Let me stop you again.

13:59.606 --> 14:02.841
Close-up magic is the world's
greatest nothing.

14:04.076 --> 14:08.012
How'd Marty score
a 22-year-old?

14:08.514 --> 14:10.415
How'd he score you?

14:10.417 --> 14:12.784
You're smart, funny,
attractive...

14:12.786 --> 14:17.088
But look at her.
I mean, she's so limber.

14:17.456 --> 14:20.191
She's like
a slutty Gumby.

14:20.659 --> 14:22.260
You know what?

14:22.262 --> 14:24.963
No one puts Veronica
in a corner.

14:26.265 --> 14:27.565
Come on.

14:27.567 --> 14:30.468
So, now that you know
I had your back all along...

14:30.470 --> 14:31.269
Yeah.
We're good.

14:31.271 --> 14:32.804
Oh, Cash,
I'm so glad you're back.

14:32.806 --> 14:34.205
The clue from
Veronica's desk

14:34.207 --> 14:35.506
leads to
the  <i>Spy Hunter</i> machine.

14:35.508 --> 14:40.879
How do you know? "S" plus "pie"
plus "hunter" equals  <i>Spy Hunter.</i>

14:42.382 --> 14:43.348
Kind of a weak clue.

14:43.350 --> 14:45.550
I think Hurley
ran out of steam.

14:45.552 --> 14:46.217
He sure did.

14:46.219 --> 14:50.455
So I suspect we have to win the game
to get the gold.

14:50.457 --> 14:55.260
The elusive
<i>Spy Hunter</i> kill screen.

14:59.198 --> 15:01.532
Some say
it's just a legend.

15:01.534 --> 15:05.270
If there's any man who can
find it, it's you, Cash.

15:06.472 --> 15:07.105
All right, well...

15:07.107 --> 15:09.974
Pull over the weapons van
and slick up the tires.

15:09.976 --> 15:13.411
I've got some spies
to hunt. Mmm.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.716
Oh...
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.399
Dance-off.
It's a dance-off.

15:40.205 --> 15:43.207
Move over there.
All right. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:43.209 --> 15:48.179
What? Oh! Oh! Wait!
Let go my arm! Let go my arm!

15:48.881 --> 15:51.349
Oh, no!

16:23.649 --> 16:27.919
Here's to showing Marty
and his prom date who's in charge.

16:27.921 --> 16:30.555
Yeah, suck it, Marty.

16:31.657 --> 16:32.890
Mmm. Ah.

16:32.892 --> 16:33.458
You know what?

16:33.460 --> 16:36.427
Thanks for getting me out there
on the dance floor.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.529
You really are
a born leader.

16:38.531 --> 16:40.298
Hey, I'll drink to that.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.699
Okay.

16:42.735 --> 16:44.268
Mmm.
To co-workers.

16:44.270 --> 16:45.503
Yeah, to co-workers.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.271
To best friends forever.

16:47.273 --> 16:48.973
Best friends forever.

16:48.975 --> 16:50.575
Mini bottles of booze.

16:50.577 --> 16:51.909
To minibars.

16:51.911 --> 16:53.811
To adult-size portions!

16:53.813 --> 16:55.513
To adult-size portions!

16:55.515 --> 16:57.815
To empty bottles
of booze!

16:57.817 --> 16:59.150
To pretzels!

16:59.152 --> 17:00.485
To hairless men!

17:00.487 --> 17:03.755
To no regrets! Whoo!

17:11.865 --> 17:12.663
Huh?

17:13.600 --> 17:15.967
Wake-up call
for Veronica Mann? No.

17:16.736 --> 17:18.536
No, dude.
She's right next door.

17:19.806 --> 17:22.040
Yes! I'm positive!

17:24.576 --> 17:25.943
Dick.

17:25.945 --> 17:28.513
Oh. Mmm.

17:32.518 --> 17:35.286
Why are you in my bed?
Wait, no, no, no.

17:35.288 --> 17:37.522
I'm in your bed.
Why am I in your bed?

17:37.524 --> 17:39.624
Oh, my God. Shut it.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.392
It's not unusual
for co-workers

17:41.394 --> 17:45.263
to end up in bed together
after a night of drinking.

17:45.265 --> 17:46.297
Yes, it is!

17:46.299 --> 17:48.866
Probably
nothing even happened.

17:48.868 --> 17:49.500
Yes, exactly!

17:49.502 --> 17:51.369
Exactly, because if something
would have happened,

17:51.371 --> 17:54.205
we would have cracked open
the intimacy pack. Right.

17:54.207 --> 17:56.974
Oh, my balls.

17:56.976 --> 18:00.511
This is why rooms
should never adjoin!

18:02.248 --> 18:02.713
Come on.

18:02.715 --> 18:05.683
Morning. Morning.
What's going on?

18:05.685 --> 18:07.218
Cash is gonna
beat a video game.

18:07.220 --> 18:09.754
I was at Habitat
for Humanity all weekend.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.522
Nobody's gathered
around me.

18:11.524 --> 18:12.190
If anyone's interested,

18:12.192 --> 18:14.058
there's a potential
kill screen coming up.

18:14.060 --> 18:15.960
<i>Spy Hunter</i> kill screen's
coming up.

18:15.962 --> 18:17.061
This is not April Fool's.

18:17.063 --> 18:19.464
A  <i>Spy Hunter</i> kill screen
is coming up.

18:19.466 --> 18:21.299
Why are you
shaking your head?

18:21.901 --> 18:25.403
Kill screen!
Kill screen!

18:25.405 --> 18:27.038
Aah!

18:32.911 --> 18:34.645
The treasure!
You did it!

18:34.647 --> 18:38.716
No. We did it.
That was so tight.

18:42.154 --> 18:44.922
Okay, gang, you ready
for your life-changing moment?

18:44.924 --> 18:46.591
Molly, would you care
to have the honors?

18:46.593 --> 18:47.492
Whoa!

18:47.494 --> 18:48.459
Hey, now!

18:48.461 --> 18:52.830
Veronica! Cameron!
You're back! Whoo!

18:52.832 --> 18:55.032
How was
the O.C.P. Conference?

18:55.034 --> 18:56.300
Mmm.

18:56.302 --> 18:56.667
Uh...

18:56.669 --> 19:00.905
You're probably wondering why there's a
cavernous hole in the floor of the garage.

19:00.907 --> 19:04.408
No! Whatevs!
Stuff happens. Okay!

19:05.145 --> 19:08.079
Check you later.
I'm a leader!

19:08.380 --> 19:09.046
Okay! Where were we?

19:09.048 --> 19:11.149
Ah, yes. We were about
to open this treasure

19:11.151 --> 19:12.850
that's going to
make us rich...

19:12.852 --> 19:16.687
Stupid, filthy,
Steven Seagal rich.

19:18.558 --> 19:19.790
What?

19:19.792 --> 19:21.893
Huh.

19:21.895 --> 19:22.527
Oh. Look at that.

19:22.529 --> 19:27.532
Hurley's treasure's actually a family
portrait drawn by his son.

19:27.599 --> 19:28.299
Carol.

19:28.301 --> 19:29.700
Would you draw me
a picture of your family?

19:29.702 --> 19:33.938
Before or after
the bus accident?

19:33.940 --> 19:35.473
Before.

19:35.874 --> 19:37.441
Yay. Arts and crafts.

19:37.443 --> 19:41.212
So beautiful. So innocent.
From the hand of a child.

19:41.214 --> 19:41.979
Worth more than gold.

19:41.981 --> 19:44.248
You lost your mind?
I mean, this is a crap drawing.

19:44.250 --> 19:47.618
Look, the sun is blue,
the grass is orange...

19:47.620 --> 19:48.653
I wanted money!

19:48.655 --> 19:50.321
Come on, Oz.
Molly's right.

19:50.323 --> 19:53.591
The real treasure we have
in this world is family.

19:53.593 --> 19:57.929
Keep the family!
I want fortune!

19:57.931 --> 20:00.198
Clean this mess up.

20:03.402 --> 20:04.268
Well...

20:04.270 --> 20:07.838
That was quite
an ugly side to Oz.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.808
And to think
I had feelings for him.

20:10.810 --> 20:13.911
Yeah. He is the worst.

20:13.913 --> 20:15.580
So... How was the hotel?

20:15.582 --> 20:17.315
Uh, you know,
they had an airport shuttle,

20:17.317 --> 20:19.283
free Wi-Fi,
and I slept with Veronica.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.586
No, it's not funny.
It's true.

20:21.588 --> 20:22.887
All right, look, man,
I was gonna toast your nads

20:22.889 --> 20:26.224
about this for a little while,
but I'm doing good deeds today.

20:26.226 --> 20:28.759
You did not have sex
with Veronica.

20:28.761 --> 20:30.094
<i>Oz! You're not picking up.</i>

20:30.096 --> 20:31.796
<i>I'm leaving you</i>
<i>a video message</i>

20:31.798 --> 20:33.097
<i>'cause this is</i>
<i>really important!</i>

20:33.099 --> 20:38.536
<i>Edward Bottlehands.</i>
<i>Oh, God, I'm so hungry.</i>

20:38.538 --> 20:40.638
<i>Wait. Wait!</i>
<i>The intimacy pack!</i>

20:40.640 --> 20:44.742
<i>Yes! There's chocolate</i>
<i>body shots in there. Perfect!</i>

20:46.511 --> 20:47.411
<i>Oh, God.</i>

20:47.413 --> 20:48.579
<i>This is so good.</i>

20:48.581 --> 20:50.147
That's why the intimacy pack
was open!

20:50.149 --> 20:52.250
I had the munchies, not the sexies.
Oh, my God, Oz!

20:52.252 --> 20:53.651
This is the best news ever.
I'm gonna go tell Veronica.

20:53.653 --> 20:57.455
No, no, no. Come on.
Let's let her sweat for a little while.

20:57.457 --> 20:59.023
Come on, man.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.962
It's the little things.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.864
Now that's the Big Dipper.

21:06.866 --> 21:09.934
And that's
the Little Dipper.

21:10.869 --> 21:13.004
You know what
would make this better?

21:13.006 --> 21:14.572
What?

21:14.574 --> 21:16.641
Lasers!

21:16.643 --> 21:18.042
Okay.

21:18.044 --> 21:20.444
See that one
right there...

21:20.446 --> 21:22.947
It's the Gemini Twins.

21:24.616 --> 21:27.051
We'll get there, kid.

21:28.053 --> 21:29.453
<i>♪ To you</i>

21:29.455 --> 21:31.422
<i>♪ Oh, oh, oh</i>

21:31.424 --> 21:36.360
<i>♪ I hope this gets to you</i>
