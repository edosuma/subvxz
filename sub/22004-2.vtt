WEBVTT

00:08.409 --> 00:09.577
(groaning softly)

00:19.253 --> 00:23.057
Oh, God.

00:23.091 --> 00:24.258
Oh.

00:34.668 --> 00:36.770
Oh, my God.

00:36.804 --> 00:39.107
(classical piano playing)

00:48.549 --> 00:50.151
Hello?

00:50.184 --> 00:51.252
Anybody?!

00:51.285 --> 00:52.620
Let me out!

00:56.257 --> 00:58.592
(crying):
Why are you doing this?

01:01.229 --> 01:02.430
Please!

01:02.463 --> 01:05.233
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:05.266 --> 01:07.701
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:07.735 --> 01:10.104
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:10.138 --> 01:11.239
* How, how, how, how

01:11.272 --> 01:13.141
* Hey, hey

01:19.547 --> 01:20.481
* You gotta come on.

01:24.552 --> 01:26.387
Our missing sailor
is Lindsey Kirk.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.289
Petty officer out
of Belle Chasse.

01:28.322 --> 01:30.424
NOPD responded
to a domestic disturbance

01:30.458 --> 01:32.526
in her apartment
a few nights ago.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.295
Cops went in.
No one home.

01:34.328 --> 01:36.297
Didn't see signs
of forced entry.

01:36.330 --> 01:37.798
Figured she was out of town
and left it alone.

01:37.831 --> 01:39.467
What's changed?
LASALLE: Petty Officer Kirk

01:39.500 --> 01:40.734
hasn't reported to duty
two days running.

01:40.768 --> 01:43.204
C.O. got concerned.

01:43.237 --> 01:45.373
What else do we know?
GREGORIO: Question is,
what are you still doing

01:45.406 --> 01:47.441
at NCIS when you're
supposed to be scarce?

01:47.475 --> 01:48.576
What are you talking about?
I'm, uh--

01:48.609 --> 01:49.610
I'm hands-free,

01:49.643 --> 01:51.579
I'm crossing the Twin Span...

01:51.612 --> 01:53.547
Because I could hear
the sax player on St. Ann Street

01:53.581 --> 01:54.815
through the phone.

01:54.848 --> 01:57.185
(saxophone playing
in background)

01:58.819 --> 02:01.522
You ever consider a career
as a detective?

02:01.555 --> 02:03.624
Look, I just got a late start,
I'm packing now.

02:03.657 --> 02:06.394
And considering coming here
before you leave?

02:06.427 --> 02:08.329
Well, if you think you need me.
No, I think we need
for you to go.

02:08.362 --> 02:09.730
Okay, just

02:09.763 --> 02:11.332
make sure you check
the NamUs database,

02:11.365 --> 02:12.566
alert state troopers...

02:12.600 --> 02:13.867
LASALLE:
And call

02:13.901 --> 02:15.236
the sheriff's office.
We got this.

02:15.269 --> 02:16.504
You got to go.

02:16.537 --> 02:18.372
Okay? Work-life balance.

02:18.406 --> 02:20.274
This is good for your sanity,
Pride.

02:20.308 --> 02:21.709
Hey, the marlin are running.
Try and have fun out there.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.211
Yeah, I know,

02:23.244 --> 02:24.812
it's just hard
when you got a case.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.414
GREGORIO: Father-daughter
fishing trip requires

02:26.447 --> 02:28.316
both father and daughter.
Now get.

02:28.349 --> 02:29.883
Okay, but if you need me,

02:29.917 --> 02:31.252
you know that you...
(beep)

02:31.285 --> 02:33.721
Hello...

02:33.754 --> 02:35.256
Hello? Can you hear me?

02:37.358 --> 02:38.892
What?
Well,

02:38.926 --> 02:40.361
you think Pride's
really gonna give up his badge

02:40.394 --> 02:42.196
for a fishing pole
and a daiquiri?

02:42.230 --> 02:43.831
Yeah, I just think he needs
a little tough love to do it.

02:43.864 --> 02:45.733
(scoffs)
Look,

02:45.766 --> 02:47.868
I've worked with Pride for a
long time, all right, Gregorio?

02:47.901 --> 02:50.871
I've seen him miss birthdays,
anniversaries, you name it.

02:50.904 --> 02:52.740
"Vacation" is not
in his vocabulary.

02:52.773 --> 02:54.608
People change, Lasalle.
Yeah. We'll see about that.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.212
PRIDE:
Oh, hell.

02:58.246 --> 02:59.880
I left my tackle box
up in the room.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.682
Can you get it, Sebastian,
for me?
SEBASTIAN: Yeah.

03:01.715 --> 03:04.318
It's in the corner,
by the desk.
I got it.

03:04.352 --> 03:05.853
What's up, Roy?

03:05.886 --> 03:06.887
You have a visitor.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.925
PRIDE:
Hello?

03:11.959 --> 03:12.960
(chuckles softly)

03:12.993 --> 03:14.595
You just
light up a room,

03:14.628 --> 03:16.430
Dwayne Pride.

03:16.464 --> 03:18.999
Man, it is so good

03:19.032 --> 03:21.835
to see you.
(chuckles)

03:21.869 --> 03:23.003
You want to tell
your bodyguard

03:23.036 --> 03:24.405
I'm cool?

03:27.007 --> 03:28.976
I'm sorry, d-do we
know each other?

03:29.009 --> 03:30.411
(chuckles)
Martha Roberts.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.481
We spent a long,

03:33.514 --> 03:35.549
rainy evening together
in the back room

03:35.583 --> 03:37.885
of the criminal
district court.

03:37.918 --> 03:39.520
June, 2002?

03:39.553 --> 03:41.021
We did?
Sure.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.623
I'll never forget it.

03:42.656 --> 03:44.658
You, me,

03:44.692 --> 03:47.395
Judge Tarlington,
and some of the most

03:47.428 --> 03:49.263
scintillating secret testimony

03:49.297 --> 03:50.398
about organized crime

03:50.431 --> 03:52.400
I have ever had
the honor to hear.

03:52.433 --> 03:54.668
(chuckles)
Yeah, well, Martha, um,

03:54.702 --> 03:56.570
I'm glad to see you again.
I'd love to catch up,

03:56.604 --> 03:58.939
but I'm afraid I have to run.
No, no, no, no. I didn't--

03:58.972 --> 04:01.809
I didn't come to swap old war
stories, I'm here about a case.

04:01.842 --> 04:03.611
Seems the fates
have brought

04:03.644 --> 04:05.346
mentor and mentee
back together again.

04:06.847 --> 04:10.484
Tell me things
about Lindsey Kirk.

04:12.386 --> 04:13.821
How do you know about
Petty Officer Kirk?

04:13.854 --> 04:15.456
Name came
across the police scanner.

04:15.489 --> 04:17.391
I'm thinking

04:17.425 --> 04:19.059
she's Mr. Lonesome's
latest victim.

04:19.092 --> 04:20.294
Mister who?

04:20.328 --> 04:21.729
Mr. Lonesome.

04:21.762 --> 04:22.930
That's what I call him.

04:22.963 --> 04:24.532
Sadistic serial killer,

04:24.565 --> 04:26.600
been taking women across
Louisiana for a decade.

04:26.634 --> 04:28.836
And Mr. Lonesome
is my white whale.

04:28.869 --> 04:31.905
That's one of the reasons
I gave up my typing gig.

04:31.939 --> 04:35.309
So I could focus
on him full-time.

04:35.343 --> 04:36.677
PATTON:
Pride.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.646
Seriously. You have to go.

04:38.679 --> 04:40.681
I know.
I was just catching up with...

04:40.714 --> 04:43.651
Martha Roberts? (scoffs)
I've been reading about you

04:43.684 --> 04:45.453
on crime blogs ever since
you pushed that LSP trooper

04:45.486 --> 04:46.720
into Bayou Sauvage.

04:46.754 --> 04:47.988
That...

04:48.021 --> 04:51.325
story was blown
way out of proportion.

04:51.359 --> 04:52.259
PATTON:
No, I remember that.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.627
An officer nearly
got eaten by a gator.

04:53.661 --> 04:55.696
First of all,
she was very rude to me.

04:55.729 --> 04:57.365
Secondly,
that gator was tiny.

04:57.398 --> 05:00.534
No way it could have eaten her.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.837
Can we please

05:03.871 --> 05:05.739
talk about Lindsey Kirk?

05:05.773 --> 05:08.576
I tell you what, why--
why don't we just

05:08.609 --> 05:11.712
set you up back here, okay?

05:11.745 --> 05:12.846
Have a seat.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.683
And...

05:15.716 --> 05:16.850
Forensic Agent Lund

05:16.884 --> 05:17.985
will sit down with you.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.553
Go over everything

05:19.587 --> 05:21.021
you've got on
Lindsey Kirk.
Come on now.

05:22.390 --> 05:23.056
Don't do that.

05:24.458 --> 05:25.058
Do what?

05:25.092 --> 05:27.395
Patronize me, dismiss me.

05:27.428 --> 05:28.095
This isn't my first rodeo.

05:28.128 --> 05:30.398
No one's dismissing you, Martha.

05:30.431 --> 05:33.567
Good. Because we're close.

05:33.601 --> 05:35.703
We can put the pieces together.
You and me.

05:35.736 --> 05:36.937
Blow the case wide open.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.739
Find your girl.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.474
Catch a killer.

05:40.508 --> 05:41.742
That sounds great.

05:41.775 --> 05:43.076
Unfortunately,

05:43.110 --> 05:44.745
I can't stay.

05:44.778 --> 05:47.481
But someone on my team will...
No.

05:47.515 --> 05:49.483
No! Not someone
on your team.

05:49.517 --> 05:50.751
You, Dwayne.

05:50.784 --> 05:52.686
I need it to be you.

05:52.720 --> 05:55.889
I'm afraid that's
not gonna happen, Martha.

06:02.596 --> 06:03.797
I'll show myself out.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.805
Anybody want to explain
what that was?

06:11.839 --> 06:13.407
Hurricane Martha.

06:13.441 --> 06:14.975
Category 5 on
the crazy cat-lady scale.

06:15.008 --> 06:16.143
I wasn't aware that
you two were so close.

06:16.176 --> 06:17.578
We're not.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.747
Still...
Still nothing.

06:19.780 --> 06:21.081
Look, you got to
hit the road, man.

06:21.114 --> 06:23.417
Leave the criminals
and the crazies to us.

06:23.451 --> 06:24.685
Come on.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.522
GREGORIO:
Christopher?

06:28.556 --> 06:31.024
LASALLE: Yeah?
Sebastian just sent me
the download on Lindsey.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.461
Lines up with what
the neighbor said.

06:33.494 --> 06:34.862
Lindsey went from foster home
to foster home.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.864
Couple run-ins
with the law.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.131
All misdemeanors.
Dropped off the map for a while

06:38.165 --> 06:39.567
until she was 20.

06:39.600 --> 06:40.601
Enlisted in the Navy.

06:42.636 --> 06:44.872
Yeah, well, maybe she
dropped off the map again.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.206
I mean, look.

06:46.239 --> 06:49.943
No clothes, no shoes,
no toothbrush,

06:49.977 --> 06:51.812
I mean, even the picture frames
is gone off the wall.

06:51.845 --> 06:54.648
Maybe she took off with
her mystery Romeo and went UA.

06:54.682 --> 06:56.550
You know, love will make you
do some crazy things.

06:56.584 --> 06:57.751
Yeah, well,
it says here Lindsey finished

06:57.785 --> 06:59.119
top of her seaman recruit class.

06:59.152 --> 07:00.788
Got high marks on evals.

07:00.821 --> 07:02.189
She had a career here.

07:02.222 --> 07:04.091
Something just
doesn't fit.

07:04.124 --> 07:05.793
Yeah, that
doesn't either.

07:05.826 --> 07:06.794
Look at that.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.764
Looks like it was dragged over.

07:12.966 --> 07:13.934
(grunts)

07:17.505 --> 07:18.872
Now, based on
those impact marks,

07:18.906 --> 07:20.808
looks like somebody
was thrown into it.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.442
A footprint.

07:24.077 --> 07:25.513
Looks like a tactical boot.

07:25.546 --> 07:28.115
Glass particulates.

07:28.148 --> 07:29.983
A fight went down here.

07:30.017 --> 07:32.486
And somebody moved
this hutch over to cover it up.

07:32.520 --> 07:34.221
Give me the BlueStar, please.

07:36.524 --> 07:37.591
(nozzle spraying)

07:42.830 --> 07:44.031
Blood splatter.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.500
Maybe Lindsey didn't drop
off the map after all.

07:46.534 --> 07:49.069
Which means,
if she wasn't killed...

07:49.102 --> 07:50.470
She was taken.

07:52.740 --> 07:53.841
(over recording):
Hey, this is Laurel.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.075
Please leave me a message.

07:55.108 --> 07:56.877
PRIDE:
Laurel,

07:56.910 --> 07:59.146
you can leave the motion
sickness patch at home.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.148
Water's glassy,
conditions are perfect.

08:01.181 --> 08:03.617
Just drive down here,
take your time, be safe,

08:03.651 --> 08:05.252
and I'll have the boat prepped
and ready when you get here.

08:05.285 --> 08:06.687
See you soon. Love you.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.256
All right.

08:09.289 --> 08:10.824
(groaning)

08:15.929 --> 08:17.831
Time to learn things,

08:17.865 --> 08:19.232
Agent Pride.

08:37.818 --> 08:40.187
(grunting softly)

08:41.922 --> 08:43.090
You sleep very peacefully,
Dwayne.

08:44.692 --> 08:45.793
Like a baby.

08:45.826 --> 08:47.294
What?!

08:47.327 --> 08:49.029
Went straight
through the night.

08:49.062 --> 08:51.131
Of course that could have been
the... (imitates Taser buzzing)

08:51.164 --> 08:53.667
Anyway,
I'm glad you're awake.

08:53.701 --> 08:54.668
Drink up.

08:54.702 --> 08:56.103
What is this, Martha?

08:56.136 --> 08:57.571
Swamp grass,

08:57.605 --> 09:00.073
sow thistle,
and newt's blood.

09:00.107 --> 09:01.975
High-octane
gator fuel.

09:02.009 --> 09:03.343
Goes down rough,
but it'll give you energy.
No.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.912
No, no, I'm talking
about the...

09:04.945 --> 09:07.581
No.
(sputters)

09:07.615 --> 09:09.850
(coughing)

09:09.883 --> 09:11.585
No.

09:11.619 --> 09:13.353
I mean kidnapping me.

09:13.386 --> 09:14.955
I wouldn't call it kidnapping.

09:14.988 --> 09:16.356
(coughs)
No?

09:16.389 --> 09:18.792
You attacked me with
a Taser, I'm tied up.

09:18.826 --> 09:21.829
I-- that doesn't look like
the Gulf out there anymo...

09:21.862 --> 09:23.330
We could nitpick
the details all day long.

09:23.363 --> 09:25.766
But the important thing
is you're here.

09:25.799 --> 09:27.234
We have work to do.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.102
You need to
think about this.

09:29.136 --> 09:30.370
(panting)

09:30.403 --> 09:32.272
People are gonna be
looking for me.

09:32.305 --> 09:33.674
No one's looking
for you, Dwayne.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.242
You're on
a father-daughter weekend.

09:35.275 --> 09:37.945
And if you're thinking
about Laurel, don't.

09:37.978 --> 09:40.313
What did you do to my daughter?
What did you do?!

09:40.347 --> 09:42.382
Whoa! Relax.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.652
Didn't do anything.

09:44.685 --> 09:46.654
Just texted her
you were on a case

09:46.687 --> 09:48.355
and that the weekend
was canceled.

09:48.388 --> 09:49.757
She didn't seem too su...
You had no right!

09:49.790 --> 09:52.793
I can't believe
she's in college!

09:52.826 --> 09:55.095
The last time I saw her,
she was just a kid.

09:55.128 --> 09:58.098
You had just busted that
trafficking ring in LaPlace.

09:58.131 --> 10:00.668
Parish president
gave you a commendation.

10:00.701 --> 10:04.304
I have a copy of that
here somewhere.

10:04.337 --> 10:05.873
Why do you have
this stuff?
Aw.

10:09.910 --> 10:11.144
You're my mentor.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.814
No, we-we don't know each other.

10:13.847 --> 10:16.349
I know you inside
and out, Dwayne.

10:16.383 --> 10:17.818
You stand up for people

10:17.851 --> 10:19.119
who can't stand
for themselves.

10:19.152 --> 10:20.754
That's why you're here.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.926
To bring these girls...

10:29.229 --> 10:30.898
...justice.

10:35.903 --> 10:39.139
Look, I'm gonna
give you a chance.

10:39.172 --> 10:41.842
All right, you let me
go right now, okay,

10:41.875 --> 10:45.112
and I won't bring you up
on federal kidnapping charges.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.681
I am not a damn kidnapper!

10:50.017 --> 10:51.819
That's Mr. Lonesome's gig.

10:51.852 --> 10:53.987
And the longer
you stall,

10:54.021 --> 10:56.223
the longer that
poor girl Lindsey

10:56.256 --> 10:58.258
has to suffer at his hands.

10:58.291 --> 10:59.359
(phone beeping)

10:59.392 --> 11:00.260
Looks like you got a text.

11:02.830 --> 11:04.998
At least someone's
taking this seriously.

11:05.032 --> 11:07.300
Texted Agent Lasalle
for an update.

11:07.334 --> 11:08.135
He's following up
on Lindsey's last call

11:08.168 --> 11:10.203
before she disappeared.

11:10.237 --> 11:11.772
Some kind of help line.

11:11.805 --> 11:14.174
You can't do this, Martha.

11:14.207 --> 11:16.343
Not alone-- that's
why you're here.

11:16.376 --> 11:17.410
We are gonna save Lindsey Kirk.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.190
Patton dumped
Lindsey's cell.

11:30.223 --> 11:31.458
Eight calls to
HelpLine NOLA

11:31.491 --> 11:32.793
in the past few days.

11:32.826 --> 11:33.927
It's a support group
that helps

11:33.961 --> 11:35.428
foster kids
and runaways.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.430
Figure the operators might know
what's been going on

11:37.464 --> 11:38.932
in Lindsey's life
before she was taken.

11:38.966 --> 11:40.934
Yeah, which will help us
get one step closer

11:40.968 --> 11:42.335
to finding out who's
behind all this.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.104
Yeah.
(phone chimes)

11:44.137 --> 11:45.839
That's Pride.

11:45.873 --> 11:47.407
Wants us to give
him an update

11:47.440 --> 11:48.809
after we're done here.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.944
You've been updating him?

11:50.978 --> 11:52.479
Of course I have.

11:52.512 --> 11:54.848
Look, it's killing Pride
not being here with us.

11:54.882 --> 11:57.851
Our smart money said he's
on his way back as we speak.

11:57.885 --> 11:59.452
Meh, not this time.

11:59.486 --> 12:00.988
How long you been
working with him?

12:01.021 --> 12:03.156
Long enough to know that
he's changed since last year.

12:03.190 --> 12:04.491
You want to bet?

12:04.524 --> 12:06.126
Yes.

12:06.159 --> 12:08.796
All right, Pride
comes back early...
Right.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.263
...the next time we
watch your Yankees,

12:10.297 --> 12:11.498
you wear a Big Papi jersey.

12:11.531 --> 12:13.233
Okay, okay.

12:13.266 --> 12:15.535
Or when Pride doesn't
come back, because he won't,

12:15.568 --> 12:16.870
you got to paint your face
purple and gold

12:16.904 --> 12:18.105
for the next LSU game.

12:18.138 --> 12:19.807
It's on like Donkey Kong.

12:22.810 --> 12:24.277
MARTHA:
Lindsey Kirk.

12:24.311 --> 12:27.214
Brown hair, blue eyes,
no family.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.817
No one who gives a crap
about her at all.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.118
Just Mr. Lonesome's type.

12:31.151 --> 12:34.121
That's what makes these girls
perfect targets.

12:34.154 --> 12:36.423
No one... no one cares.

12:36.456 --> 12:39.326
No one will miss 'em.
Except you.

12:39.359 --> 12:41.394
You're the only one
who sees a pattern here.

12:41.428 --> 12:42.362
I'm not delusional, Dwayne.

12:42.395 --> 12:43.864
I see a pattern because
there is a pattern.

12:43.897 --> 12:44.932
Okay.

12:47.935 --> 12:49.569
It's a replica.
The Truck Stop Chopper

12:49.602 --> 12:52.339
used one exactly like it
to take out his victims.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.908
Amazing what you can buy
off eBay.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.176
Yeah, to catch killers,
you got to understand

12:56.209 --> 12:57.344
what's going on in their minds,

12:57.377 --> 12:58.145
you got to study their tools,

12:58.178 --> 13:00.981
step into their shoes.

13:01.014 --> 13:02.916
So you got ten
missing girls.

13:02.950 --> 13:06.954
You believe they were
all abducted and murdered

13:06.987 --> 13:09.489
by a serial killer,
and yet not one shred

13:09.522 --> 13:10.490
of hard evidence.

13:10.523 --> 13:12.025
You're looking at the evidence

13:12.059 --> 13:13.994
covering every inch
of this wall.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.428
It's just speculation.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.030
High school photos, eye color--

13:17.064 --> 13:19.366
coincidence,
conjecture.

13:19.399 --> 13:21.268
You're driving me nuts, dude!

13:21.301 --> 13:24.004
You think I would go to all the
trouble of getting you out here

13:24.037 --> 13:25.873
if I didn't have the juice
to back it up?

13:27.941 --> 13:31.478
Okay, Martha,
you got my attention.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.052
MAN:
This is Taylor Price.

13:39.086 --> 13:40.120
he's the one that
spoke with Lindsey

13:40.153 --> 13:41.254
the night she disappeared.

13:41.288 --> 13:42.289
And every other night.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.224
She was a regular.

13:44.257 --> 13:46.093
Was something bothering her?
Well, sure--
adulthood.

13:46.126 --> 13:48.028
Most of the young people
that we deal with here

13:48.061 --> 13:50.130
are used to being
on their own, untethered.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.398
They have no real connection,

13:51.431 --> 13:52.966
and when times get tough,

13:53.000 --> 13:54.267
they pull up stakes and move on.

13:54.301 --> 13:56.303
Right.
Well, unfortunately,

13:56.336 --> 13:57.237
we don't think she ran.

13:57.270 --> 14:01.141
We think she was taken.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.610
You don't seem surprised.

14:03.643 --> 14:06.313
Honestly, I'm not.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.948
Lindsey was
freaked out recently.

14:07.981 --> 14:09.149
She was almost sure
she had a stalker.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.184
Stalker?

14:11.218 --> 14:12.652
Yeah. A couple
of weeks back,

14:12.685 --> 14:14.287
she got the feeling like
she was being watched.

14:14.321 --> 14:16.456
I figured she was just
being paranoid.

14:16.489 --> 14:17.891
Living alone can do that to you.

14:17.925 --> 14:19.526
But then it got weird.

14:19.559 --> 14:20.360
Someone kept leaving
gifts for her.

14:20.393 --> 14:23.463
Old books, flowers.
Romantic stuff.

14:23.496 --> 14:24.965
Did she call the cops?

14:24.998 --> 14:25.899
And say what?

14:25.933 --> 14:27.334
It's not against the law
to give presents.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.069
That's why Lindsey
was calling us so often.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.237
She needed somebody to listen.

14:30.270 --> 14:32.005
Well, did she give
you any details about

14:32.039 --> 14:34.307
who might be
watching her, or...

14:34.341 --> 14:36.076
The guy was like a ghost.
And by the end of the night,

14:36.109 --> 14:37.177
she had half-convinced herself

14:37.210 --> 14:38.478
that she made
the whole thing up.

14:38.511 --> 14:40.447
I guess she didn't
make it up after all.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.923
Police paid no attention
to these disappearances,

14:49.957 --> 14:52.025
but I did.

14:52.059 --> 14:54.327
I managed to run a cross-case
evidence analysis

14:54.361 --> 14:55.595
at each apartment.

14:55.628 --> 14:59.466
What do you see?

14:59.499 --> 15:01.234
Uh, Renaissance art books.

15:01.268 --> 15:02.302
Huh?

15:02.335 --> 15:04.972
Uh, exotic flowers.

15:05.005 --> 15:06.974
Sundials?

15:07.007 --> 15:11.478
MARTHA: These girls are
all undereducated, broke.

15:11.511 --> 15:14.347
How is it that all of
'em share an interest

15:14.381 --> 15:17.017
in classical art
and ancient timepieces?

15:19.719 --> 15:22.489
You want to tell me
things about those pills?

15:22.522 --> 15:24.024
The pills are nothing,
not connected.

15:24.057 --> 15:25.525
Stay on point here.
Okay.

15:25.558 --> 15:30.230
It's unlikely that these girls
have these same interests

15:30.263 --> 15:31.531
in common.

15:31.564 --> 15:33.600
Someone had to give 'em
these gifts.

15:33.633 --> 15:36.436
Mr. Lonesome plays
secret admirer,

15:36.469 --> 15:38.972
showers 'em with gifts
before he takes 'em.

15:39.006 --> 15:41.008
Follow the gifts,
you find your killer.
Oh, yes.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.609
Now you understand.

15:42.642 --> 15:44.477
Now you see.
Yes. Okay.

15:44.511 --> 15:48.048
So... we need to reach
out to my team.

15:48.081 --> 15:50.017
See if Lindsey had any
of these same items

15:50.050 --> 15:52.519
in her apartment--
pull forensics.

15:52.552 --> 15:54.487
Learn things, yes.
Yes, give me my phone.

15:54.521 --> 15:56.089
Okay?
No, no, no.
I-I got this.

15:56.123 --> 15:59.392
Martha, I-I want to help you,
I do, but

15:59.426 --> 16:03.030
between being tased
and... and whatever

16:03.063 --> 16:04.131
you gave me to knock me out...

16:04.164 --> 16:05.598
Valerian root.

16:05.632 --> 16:06.666
I'm still feeling kind of fuzzy.

16:06.699 --> 16:09.236
Give me a holler
if your team texts.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.778
Find anything
on Lindsey's stalker?

16:18.811 --> 16:20.580
No, ran the whole
apartment for trace.

16:20.613 --> 16:22.115
No DNA other
than Lindsey's,

16:22.149 --> 16:23.616
but I did find
a strange residue

16:23.650 --> 16:24.617
on that boot print
that you guys found.

16:24.651 --> 16:27.020
Pyrethrum.

16:27.054 --> 16:29.022
It's an organic insecticide
used for crop dusting.

16:29.056 --> 16:30.757
We find out where
the stalker tracked it in from,

16:30.790 --> 16:32.792
we might be able to
find his location.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.527
Only problem is it's used
on over 400 farms

16:34.561 --> 16:36.063
in Louisiana alone.

16:36.096 --> 16:37.597
It's gonna take forever
to narrow it down.

16:37.630 --> 16:40.133
LASALLE:
Pride sent me a text.

16:40.167 --> 16:43.303
He got a tip from
a law enforcement buddy.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.738
"Check Lindsey's apartment
for a book on Renaissance art,

16:45.772 --> 16:47.640
sundial, and exotic flowers."

16:47.674 --> 16:50.143
Pride's buddy's
onto something.

16:50.177 --> 16:52.445
LASALLE: Well, you mean
Pride's onto something.

16:52.479 --> 16:54.314
He must be working the case
from Gulf Shores, which means

16:54.347 --> 16:57.217
New York here just earned
herself a Red Sox jersey.

16:57.250 --> 17:00.120
Un, no, not until I see him walk
through that door I haven't.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.821
Besides, this stuff doesn't
get us any closer

17:01.854 --> 17:03.823
to finding Lindsey
or the stalker.

17:03.856 --> 17:06.059
That's not entirely true.
The Madagascar jasmine,

17:06.093 --> 17:07.227
that's...
that's promising.

17:07.260 --> 17:08.228
Let's see, yeah.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.230
Pyrethrum isn't just
used on crops.

17:10.263 --> 17:12.199
It's also used
on exotic flowers.

17:12.232 --> 17:13.266
Patton, can you search for

17:13.300 --> 17:15.135
for Southern Louisiana

17:15.168 --> 17:16.736
specialty nurseries, ones
that deal in exotic flora?

17:16.769 --> 17:18.405
I'm on it.

17:18.438 --> 17:21.241
Rare Earth Nursery
on the West Bank.

17:21.274 --> 17:23.143
But it went under last year.

17:23.176 --> 17:23.776
That doesn't mean
that the greenhouses

17:23.810 --> 17:24.577
still aren't functioning.

17:24.611 --> 17:27.414
Stalker tracked in
the pesticide.

17:27.447 --> 17:28.581
There's a good chance that
he's growing those flowers

17:28.615 --> 17:29.782
out there himself.

17:29.816 --> 17:31.784
Well, there's only one way
to find out.

17:41.828 --> 17:43.330
LASALLE: Doesn't seem like
there's been any activity

17:43.363 --> 17:44.764
in here in a while.

17:44.797 --> 17:46.433
Not so sure
about that.

17:46.466 --> 17:48.301
Madagascar jasmine, just
like we found at Lindsey's.

17:50.403 --> 17:51.871
This type of flower requires
a lot of attention.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.140
I'm talking, like,

17:53.173 --> 17:54.040
daily care.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.109
Whoever raised this
was here recently.

17:56.143 --> 17:58.378
GREGORIO:
Guys, I'm in the nursery,
come check this out.

18:04.351 --> 18:06.319
What you got?

18:06.353 --> 18:07.487
See that?

18:11.224 --> 18:13.693
Marks from a door
that's not there.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.195
Oh, it's there, it's just
been bricked over.

18:15.228 --> 18:16.663
I mean, look around,
look at these bricks.

18:16.696 --> 18:18.598
They're older
than I am.

18:18.631 --> 18:19.799
But this wall...

18:19.832 --> 18:21.334
Looks like it's
just been laid.

18:21.368 --> 18:22.835
Yeah.

18:22.869 --> 18:24.737
Maybe something's back there.

18:26.506 --> 18:28.241
(Lasalle grunting)

18:30.743 --> 18:31.711
I see something.

18:36.283 --> 18:37.650
Call an ambulance.

18:47.360 --> 18:50.863
(breathing heavily):
Come on. Come on.

18:52.265 --> 18:52.832
(groans)

18:54.534 --> 18:56.536
Totally knew you'd try that,
Dwayne.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.238
Signal jammer.

18:58.271 --> 19:02.175
Has to be off to send
or receive messages.

19:02.209 --> 19:03.576
All you had to do was wait
for your yerba maté,

19:03.610 --> 19:05.445
but you took the bait.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.714
(device beeps)
It's true what they say.

19:07.747 --> 19:08.881
Never meet your heroes.

19:08.915 --> 19:10.383
They'll only disappoint.

19:12.219 --> 19:14.654
One new message.
Oh.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.556
Let's see what Agent Lasalle
has to say.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.525
(shuddering)

19:20.327 --> 19:22.295
You wanted a body?!

19:22.329 --> 19:24.764
I gave you a body!

19:24.797 --> 19:27.767
You will not doubt me again!

19:38.978 --> 19:40.980
WADE:
Same height, eye color.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.882
Even the same bone structure
as Lindsey, but it's not her.

19:42.915 --> 19:44.451
Who is she?

19:44.484 --> 19:46.619
Jane Doe, until someone
comes to I.D. her.

19:46.653 --> 19:49.289
I ran her DNA,
fingerprints,

19:49.322 --> 19:51.658
even checked NamUs--
she's not in the system.

19:51.691 --> 19:52.925
Means Lindsey's still out there.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.327
Get cause of death?

19:54.361 --> 19:55.428
Judging by the veins,

19:55.462 --> 19:57.364
the cyanosis of the skin,

19:57.397 --> 19:59.266
it appears she died
of asphyxiation.

19:59.299 --> 20:00.500
So the sicko
that put her

20:00.533 --> 20:02.001
in a brick box
made it airtight?

20:02.034 --> 20:03.303
That's what it looks like,

20:03.336 --> 20:05.338
Any idea how long
she's been dead?

20:05.372 --> 20:06.773
It's difficult to say.

20:06.806 --> 20:07.807
The lack of oxygen
in the room

20:07.840 --> 20:09.008
preserved her body,

20:09.041 --> 20:10.310
but seeing how rapidly

20:10.343 --> 20:11.644
her organs deteriorated,

20:11.678 --> 20:13.413
she could conceivably
have been dead

20:13.446 --> 20:15.682
weeks, longer even.

20:15.715 --> 20:16.849
And who knows how long
she's been in there before that?

20:16.883 --> 20:19.319
The room had a bed,
sink, toilet,

20:19.352 --> 20:20.287
water, even food.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.521
This was premeditated,

20:21.554 --> 20:22.955
sadistic,
executed with precision.

20:22.989 --> 20:24.957
We're dealing
with a serial killer here.

20:24.991 --> 20:27.460
Yeah, Lindsey could
be our next victim

20:27.494 --> 20:30.330
if we don't find her before
the psycho traps her in a box.

20:30.363 --> 20:31.964
Bet's off. We need
all hands on deck.
I'm calling Pride.

20:31.998 --> 20:33.900
Call him.
Yeah, well,
you're not gonna get him.

20:33.933 --> 20:35.568
I've been trying his cell
ever since we found the body.

20:35.602 --> 20:36.936
Keeps going straight
to voice mail.

20:36.969 --> 20:38.371
Well, he's probably
on the water with Laurel.

20:38.405 --> 20:39.639
There's no service in the Gulf.

20:39.672 --> 20:40.440
Well, that's what I thought,
too,

20:40.473 --> 20:41.641
until I actually spoke
to Laurel.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.543
She's not with her father.

20:43.576 --> 20:44.944
She said that Pride
canceled on her last minute,

20:44.977 --> 20:46.779
told her he was working
a case with us.

20:46.813 --> 20:48.281
No, something's off.

20:48.315 --> 20:50.550
My feelings exactly.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.452
MARTHA:
Don't be a wiggle worm, Dwayne.

20:52.485 --> 20:54.587
Only make things worse.
(groaning)

20:54.621 --> 20:58.024
Why are you so sure that...
the body isn't Lindsey?

20:58.057 --> 20:59.959
Lindsey is his latest prize.

20:59.992 --> 21:01.528
He's invested

21:01.561 --> 21:03.463
time and money.

21:03.496 --> 21:04.864
Grown the flowers,
built the sundial.

21:04.897 --> 21:07.734
Built her
a damn secret room.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.302
Why kill her so soon,
is that it?

21:09.336 --> 21:10.537
Mm-hmm. Mr. Lonesome

21:10.570 --> 21:12.672
is playing savior
to these girls.

21:12.705 --> 21:14.941
Needs to give her a chance
to redeem herself

21:14.974 --> 21:16.343
in the proper way

21:16.376 --> 21:17.477
before he cuts bait.

21:17.510 --> 21:18.811
Now, back
to these stitches.

21:18.845 --> 21:19.879
Wait.

21:19.912 --> 21:22.349
Wait.
Hey, Dwayne.

21:22.382 --> 21:23.816
You have faced death
how many times?

21:23.850 --> 21:25.752
I can't believe you're scared
of a little needle.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.954
No, listen, listen.

21:27.987 --> 21:32.359
I think I know who the
victim in the photo is.

21:32.392 --> 21:33.460
She's right there on your wall.

21:33.493 --> 21:34.994
Second from the top,
on the left.

21:35.027 --> 21:37.930
Pull the crime scene photo
up on my phone.

21:37.964 --> 21:39.332
See if the sequins on the dress

21:39.366 --> 21:40.433
match the red dress
on the wall.

21:40.467 --> 21:42.469
MARTHA:
Holy moly.

21:42.502 --> 21:43.670
Oh, my God.

21:43.703 --> 21:45.505
That's Shelley Wright.

21:45.538 --> 21:47.440
Runaway from Baton Rouge.

21:47.474 --> 21:49.809
Went missing nine months ago.
Oh.

21:49.842 --> 21:51.444
(winces)

21:51.478 --> 21:53.346
I knew you were
here for a reason.

21:53.380 --> 21:55.382
Come off it, Martha.

21:55.415 --> 21:57.650
I know walls
like this firsthand.

21:57.684 --> 21:59.952
You know every inch
of every photo on it,

21:59.986 --> 22:01.554
and if you weren't
so focused on sewing me up,

22:01.588 --> 22:02.722
you would've seen it, too.
Maybe.

22:02.755 --> 22:05.692
Maybe not. Point is,

22:05.725 --> 22:07.994
we got a good thing going here.
No, the point is

22:08.027 --> 22:10.997
you've got me caged like one
of Mr. Lonesome's victims

22:11.030 --> 22:13.065
and you have me playing
your little game.

22:13.099 --> 22:14.567
There is no game.

22:14.601 --> 22:17.570
This is life and
death, Dwayne.

22:17.604 --> 22:19.372
I thought you
would understand.

22:19.406 --> 22:21.541
Every case you have
ever worked on,

22:21.574 --> 22:23.843
you always see something
that no one else sees.

22:23.876 --> 22:25.044
Yeah, you know
what I see right now?

22:25.077 --> 22:27.447
All around this cabin?

22:27.480 --> 22:29.449
Gifts from the kidnapper
to the girls.

22:29.482 --> 22:31.484
That's what you
call 'em, right?

22:31.518 --> 22:33.953
Right. Those are research.

22:33.986 --> 22:37.657
You know every detail
of Mr. Lonesome's M.O.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.559
Things no one else could know
but the killer.

22:39.592 --> 22:40.960
I'm methodical.

22:40.993 --> 22:43.062
You're obsessed,

22:43.095 --> 22:44.564
which makes sense,
considering the meds you're on.

22:44.597 --> 22:46.065
Olanzapine is
an antipsychotic.

22:46.098 --> 22:47.934
Shows what you know.

22:47.967 --> 22:49.769
I have been off the
pills for weeks.
Exactly, Martha,

22:49.802 --> 22:51.604
which makes you
unstable and dangerous

22:51.638 --> 22:53.005
to yourself, to others.

22:53.039 --> 22:55.608
No!
You don't understand.

22:55.642 --> 22:57.677
The medicine makes me fuzzy,

22:57.710 --> 22:59.779
and I was getting really close
to a breakthrough.

22:59.812 --> 23:01.481
I needed a clear head.

23:01.514 --> 23:02.849
You call this thinking clearly?
You kidnapped me

23:02.882 --> 23:06.052
just like your killer.

23:06.085 --> 23:08.421
I'm starting to wonder what
makes you different from him,

23:08.455 --> 23:10.990
if anything at all.

23:14.160 --> 23:16.863
(crying):
You think I'm Mr. Lonesome?

23:16.896 --> 23:19.732
Well, let me tell
you something!

23:19.766 --> 23:22.902
If I was, you'd be in deep
trouble, more than you know!

23:22.935 --> 23:26.038
(screams)

23:26.072 --> 23:27.540
(crying):
I did this all for nothing!

23:29.208 --> 23:30.577
(shouts)

23:30.610 --> 23:33.145
You ruined everything,
everything!

23:35.047 --> 23:36.849
PATTON:
Can't get a trace on
Pride's phone.

23:36.883 --> 23:37.984
Something is blocking it.

23:38.017 --> 23:40.052
But I ran his car GPS.

23:40.086 --> 23:42.622
I found it parked near the boat
he rented in Gulf Shores.

23:42.655 --> 23:45.525
I'm pulling traffic cams now
from when he arrived yesterday.

23:45.558 --> 23:46.726
Can you blow that up?

23:49.228 --> 23:50.329
That's Hurricane Martha.

23:50.362 --> 23:52.799
Crazy lady you said was at
the squad room yesterday?

23:52.832 --> 23:54.934
Crazy lady that was
mucho obsessed with Pride.

23:54.967 --> 23:57.103
Yeah, and psycho obsessed
with Lindsey's disappearance.

23:57.136 --> 23:59.138
She got awfully pissy
when he wouldn't listen to her.

23:59.171 --> 24:01.508
So, what, y'all think
she kidnapped Pride

24:01.541 --> 24:03.543
because he hurt her feelings?
That seems a little extreme.

24:03.576 --> 24:05.011
PATTON:
Yeah, for a sane person,

24:05.044 --> 24:06.813
but according to our records,
she's anything but.

24:06.846 --> 24:08.548
Well, she suffers from OCD,

24:08.581 --> 24:10.617
severe bipolar
depressive disorder,

24:10.650 --> 24:11.784
and a history of violence.

24:11.818 --> 24:13.119
PATTON:
Charges for harassment,

24:13.152 --> 24:15.187
aggravated assault, stalking.

24:15.221 --> 24:17.824
This lady's
seriously dangerous.
Okay, all right.

24:17.857 --> 24:20.059
Did you, did you ping
his last text location?

24:20.092 --> 24:21.528
I mean, I know that
we can't track his phone,

24:21.561 --> 24:22.695
but that could get us close.

24:22.729 --> 24:23.763
PATTON:
I have my systems scanning.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.064
Let me see if we got a hit.

24:25.097 --> 24:26.733
Bingo.

24:26.766 --> 24:29.636
Came from a cell tower
deep in the sticks

24:29.669 --> 24:31.137
near Pearl River.

24:31.170 --> 24:33.005
Nothing out there but swamp
and a handful of cabins.

24:33.039 --> 24:34.807
Fewer doors we have to
kick in to find Pride.

24:34.841 --> 24:36.509
Let's ride.

24:36.543 --> 24:38.511
Go learn something.

24:38.545 --> 24:40.146
MARTHA:
All I've ever done

24:40.179 --> 24:42.214
is try to follow
your path, Dwayne.

24:42.248 --> 24:43.883
Be smart.

24:43.916 --> 24:46.052
Study the details.

24:46.085 --> 24:47.554
Look out for the little guy.

24:47.587 --> 24:48.955
And this is my reward.

24:48.988 --> 24:51.624
You call me a killer.

24:51.658 --> 24:52.892
You're not thinking straight.

24:52.925 --> 24:54.727
Can't afford to
think straight

24:54.761 --> 24:58.064
with nine girls dead
and one still out there.

24:58.097 --> 24:59.899
PRIDE: Collecting their jewelry,
their hair,

24:59.932 --> 25:01.834
personal belongings.

25:01.868 --> 25:03.202
How does that help you
find them?

25:03.235 --> 25:05.905
It doesn't.

25:05.938 --> 25:07.607
Obviously.

25:07.640 --> 25:09.041
But no one listens to me.

25:09.075 --> 25:11.110
No one cares.

25:11.143 --> 25:12.812
It's all I could do
to keep their memories alive.

25:12.845 --> 25:14.280
Why?

25:14.313 --> 25:17.584
Why risk everything
by grabbing me?

25:17.617 --> 25:20.720
Why does it matter
to you so much?

25:23.022 --> 25:25.224
'Cause I know what it's like
to be forgotten,

25:25.257 --> 25:27.093
just like them.

25:27.126 --> 25:28.761
(sniffles)

25:28.795 --> 25:30.730
They deserve
better than this.

25:32.031 --> 25:34.100
I agree, Martha.

25:34.133 --> 25:35.968
They really do.

25:36.002 --> 25:38.905
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:38.938 --> 25:42.241
Martha, let me help you.

25:42.274 --> 25:44.310
Don't you move.

25:44.343 --> 25:45.912
Come on, Martha.

25:47.680 --> 25:49.315
You can trust me.

25:49.348 --> 25:50.282
(door breaks)

25:50.316 --> 25:52.084
NCIS, drop the weapon!

25:52.118 --> 25:53.786
No, no, wait.

25:55.254 --> 25:56.756
What are you doing, Pride?

25:56.789 --> 25:59.025
I'm trying to save Lindsey,

25:59.058 --> 26:01.260
and I think Martha can help.

26:16.375 --> 26:19.912
Murder weapons, locks
of hair, crazy wall.

26:19.946 --> 26:21.347
The girl is certifiable.

26:21.380 --> 26:23.182
BTK, Son of Sam,
Green River Killer,

26:23.215 --> 26:24.884
all had similar levels
of obsession.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.953
Well, it still doesn't explain
why she took me.

26:26.986 --> 26:29.889
Well, maybe she's like
the Zodiac, wanted to brag.

26:29.922 --> 26:31.357
I don't know. I leaned on
her pretty hard in there.

26:31.390 --> 26:33.059
She said she'd rather die

26:33.092 --> 26:34.794
than give up
on those girls.

26:34.827 --> 26:36.863
That's not sadism.
That's empathy.

26:36.896 --> 26:39.365
Uh, woman tased you, beat you,

26:39.398 --> 26:41.067
tied you up and stuck you
with a needle.

26:41.100 --> 26:43.335
I'm not seeing a lot of love
for humanity here.

26:43.369 --> 26:46.673
I know she's disturbed,

26:46.706 --> 26:48.174
just not in the way
you're saying.

26:48.207 --> 26:51.110
King, she tried to split you
in two with a hatchet.

26:51.143 --> 26:52.745
Pretty sure she wasn't gonna.

26:52.779 --> 26:55.314
Pretty sure, huh? Starting
to think that head wound

26:55.347 --> 26:57.116
is a little worse
than we thought.
All right, guys, sorry.

26:57.149 --> 26:58.685
We-we can debate this all day,
but we don't have time.

26:58.718 --> 27:00.152
I just ran some calculations,

27:00.186 --> 27:01.854
and if Lindsey has been
sealed in a room

27:01.888 --> 27:03.656
that's roughly the same
dimensions as Shelley's,

27:03.690 --> 27:05.658
she doesn't have long to live.
She could be dead by nightfall.

27:05.692 --> 27:07.159
Yeah, and we still
don't have any leads.

27:07.193 --> 27:09.662
We don't, but Martha does.

27:13.099 --> 27:15.301
PRIDE: Every minute that goes by
is a minute less for Lindsey.

27:15.334 --> 27:17.369
That's what I've been
telling you.

27:17.403 --> 27:19.906
My team is convinced
you're responsible

27:19.939 --> 27:22.374
for her abduction.

27:22.408 --> 27:25.812
Yeah, I can see it
on their faces.

27:28.080 --> 27:30.116
What do you think, Dwayne?

27:30.149 --> 27:32.752
You nearly killed me
trying to get my attention,

27:32.785 --> 27:34.687
and it worked.

27:34.721 --> 27:37.389
Why are you so fixated
on these missing girls?

27:37.423 --> 27:39.158
You wouldn't understand.

27:39.191 --> 27:41.961
Martha, you've studied me.

27:41.994 --> 27:44.764
You know the things I've
done to get justice.

27:48.400 --> 27:49.702
Why don't you try me?

27:53.873 --> 27:57.309
First time I was committed,
I was 12.

27:57.343 --> 28:00.813
My mom was done
trying to deal with me.

28:00.847 --> 28:02.348
She put me
in a state hospital.

28:02.381 --> 28:05.451
They locked me
in an isolation room.

28:05.484 --> 28:08.120
Complete sensory deprivation.

28:08.154 --> 28:11.257
You have any idea
what that does to a person?

28:11.290 --> 28:13.459
I can't imagine.

28:13.492 --> 28:15.394
I was a little girl.

28:15.427 --> 28:17.129
I-I needed comforting.

28:17.163 --> 28:19.331
I needed reassurance,
but they...

28:19.365 --> 28:21.167
they threw me away.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.468
You know, out of sight,
out of mind.

28:22.501 --> 28:25.972
Like Lindsey and the others.

28:26.005 --> 28:28.140
MARTHA:
Misfits, runaways.

28:28.174 --> 28:31.043
No one cared
they were hurting.

28:31.077 --> 28:33.479
No one noticed they were gone.

28:33.512 --> 28:35.414
But you did.

28:35.447 --> 28:37.483
They deserve justice

28:37.516 --> 28:40.820
just like anyone else.

28:40.853 --> 28:43.522
I am really sorry
that I hurt you, Dwayne,

28:43.555 --> 28:45.858
but I am not sorry
I got your attention.

28:48.828 --> 28:50.062
We're gonna get Lindsey back.

28:52.064 --> 28:53.465
And you're gonna help.

28:56.435 --> 28:59.405
Mr. Lonesome has a type.
We know that much.

28:59.438 --> 29:02.208
What we don't know is how or
where he finds his victims.

29:02.241 --> 29:03.542
Well, the one link we have
is Shelley Wright,

29:03.575 --> 29:05.311
last girl taken before Lindsey.

29:05.344 --> 29:08.547
Sealed in a secret room in
an abandoned greenhouse.

29:08.580 --> 29:09.849
LASALLE:
We find any overlap

29:09.882 --> 29:12.284
between Shelley and Lindsey,

29:12.318 --> 29:13.252
we narrow in on our killer.

29:13.285 --> 29:14.987
(Martha laughs)

29:15.021 --> 29:17.924
It's like a master class
in sleuthing.

29:17.957 --> 29:19.992
Is it really
necessary she's here?

29:20.026 --> 29:20.860
What exactly do you have
against me, New York?

29:20.893 --> 29:23.229
For starters,
that you creepily know

29:23.262 --> 29:24.964
my nickname.

29:24.997 --> 29:26.933
Plus, you beat the
crap out of our boss.

29:26.966 --> 29:30.436
Okay, so what do we know
about Shelley?

29:30.469 --> 29:32.872
SEBASTIAN: Well, according
to Martha's intel,

29:32.905 --> 29:34.373
she ran away from home
when she was 16.

29:34.406 --> 29:36.075
Ended up in Baton Rouge.

29:36.108 --> 29:37.309
Waitress by day,

29:37.343 --> 29:39.278
community college student
by night.

29:39.311 --> 29:43.215
And she was abducted on
the night of January 3, 2017

29:43.249 --> 29:44.817
from her apartment,
gone without a trace.

29:44.851 --> 29:46.252
MARTHA:
That's Mr. Lonesome.

29:46.285 --> 29:47.987
He slips in and out
without being seen.

29:48.020 --> 29:49.956
Knows everything
about these girls,

29:49.989 --> 29:52.291
like he's supernatural.

29:52.324 --> 29:55.828
No. He's not supernatural,
just a good listener.

29:55.862 --> 29:57.296
According to Shelley's
phone records,

29:57.329 --> 29:59.966
she made several calls
in the hours leading up

29:59.999 --> 30:02.601
to her disappearance,
all to HelpLine Baton Rouge.

30:02.634 --> 30:04.003
LASALLE:
Lindsey's last call

30:04.036 --> 30:05.271
the night she was abducted

30:05.304 --> 30:06.572
was to HelpLine NOLA.

30:06.605 --> 30:08.440
More than just those two.

30:08.474 --> 30:10.209
I scanned the call logs
of the other missing girls

30:10.242 --> 30:13.112
on Martha's board.
HelpLine.

30:13.145 --> 30:16.916
Lafayette, Shreveport,
Alexandria.

30:16.949 --> 30:18.550
Think we know where Mr. Lonesome
is finding his victims.

30:18.584 --> 30:20.319
Got to be someone with access
to their records.

30:20.352 --> 30:22.121
Checking anyone who has worked

30:22.154 --> 30:23.422
multiple call centers.

30:23.455 --> 30:26.158
I see you.

30:26.192 --> 30:28.027
GREGORIO:
Brian Davis,

30:28.060 --> 30:29.996
the supervisor we spoke to
at HelpLine NOLA.

30:30.029 --> 30:32.098
Right, and the only one
who worked

30:32.131 --> 30:34.066
at all the call centers
in question.

30:34.100 --> 30:35.467
I got his address.

30:35.501 --> 30:37.069
We need to grab him now.

30:37.103 --> 30:38.070
I'm coming with you.

30:38.104 --> 30:39.205
Not a chance in hell.

30:39.238 --> 30:40.139
Good idea.

30:40.172 --> 30:41.573
I'll stay back,

30:41.607 --> 30:43.575
man the phones.
Don't touch anything.

30:43.609 --> 30:45.344
Right, okay. Good luck.

30:47.413 --> 30:49.348
(exhales)

30:56.022 --> 30:58.490
This place is like a fortress.

30:58.524 --> 31:00.326
Yeah, it's probably where
the creep is keeping Lindsey.

31:00.359 --> 31:02.228
Yeah. You two
search the grounds,

31:02.261 --> 31:03.595
take the back, we got the front.

31:03.629 --> 31:06.632
You come across Davis,
hold your fire.

31:06.665 --> 31:09.135
If Lindsey's not here, he's the
only one who knows where she is.

31:09.168 --> 31:10.102
Go.
Got it.

31:27.119 --> 31:29.055
(hinges squeak)

31:40.532 --> 31:43.535
(piano playing in distance)

31:45.537 --> 31:47.173
(whispers):
You hear that?

31:47.206 --> 31:48.540
(piano continues
playing in distance)

31:52.578 --> 31:53.946
(piano playing nearby)

31:53.980 --> 31:55.982
(quietly):
Here we go.

32:09.095 --> 32:11.430
I found him.

32:11.463 --> 32:12.464
Hands up.

32:18.270 --> 32:21.007
I was just getting
to the best part.

32:30.549 --> 32:34.320
(door closes)

32:34.353 --> 32:35.721
Davis give up where
he's keeping Lindsey?

32:35.754 --> 32:37.990
No, but he did threaten to
press charges against us

32:38.024 --> 32:39.191
for unlawful entry.

32:39.225 --> 32:40.626
Lasalle's giving
Davis another go,

32:40.659 --> 32:42.328
but it doesn't look good.

32:42.361 --> 32:43.729
You get anything solid

32:43.762 --> 32:45.697
to connect him
to any of the victims?

32:45.731 --> 32:48.334
Other than the fact that he
worked at every call center, no.

32:48.367 --> 32:50.069
Man's house was covered
in evidence.

32:50.102 --> 32:53.039
Sundials, exotic flowers,
old art.

32:53.072 --> 32:54.440
All circumstantial.

32:54.473 --> 32:56.575
Not enough to force
a confession yet.

32:56.608 --> 32:58.744
Yeah, and every minute that goes
by could be Lindsey's last.

32:58.777 --> 33:00.379
We don't get something
to turn the screws on him,

33:00.412 --> 33:02.514
he's got no reason to talk.

33:02.548 --> 33:04.450
No rational reason.

33:10.222 --> 33:12.024
Time for the irrational.

33:16.628 --> 33:18.697
Robyn Marcus.

33:20.732 --> 33:22.068
You remember her?

33:24.303 --> 33:26.138
No one forgets
their first.

33:26.172 --> 33:27.773
The thrill of the hunt.

33:27.806 --> 33:31.443
Satisfaction
that comes from conquest.

33:31.477 --> 33:35.514
Expected her to be grateful,
didn't you?

33:35.547 --> 33:37.516
But Robyn refused.

33:37.549 --> 33:39.551
Just like Sarah.

33:40.652 --> 33:42.788
Leyla.

33:42.821 --> 33:44.690
Ashley.
What is this?

33:44.723 --> 33:46.792
Some kind of
interrogation technique?

33:46.825 --> 33:48.227
Good cop, crazy cop?

33:48.260 --> 33:49.361
I'm not a cop.

33:49.395 --> 33:51.130
PRIDE:
She's a consultant.
Oh.

33:51.163 --> 33:53.099
Trying to get to the truth here.

33:53.132 --> 33:55.301
Well, the truth is I was a voice
on the phone to these girls.

33:55.334 --> 33:56.268
MARTHA: And what
about all the gifts?

33:57.869 --> 34:00.206
The books, sundials,

34:00.239 --> 34:02.208
exotic flowers.

34:02.241 --> 34:03.542
Gestures of kindness
in a cruel world.

34:03.575 --> 34:05.377
So what?
No.

34:05.411 --> 34:07.479
An attempt
to draw them in.

34:07.513 --> 34:10.182
But they saw right through you,
didn't they?

34:10.216 --> 34:12.684
They could tell right away
that you weren't worthy.

34:12.718 --> 34:14.320
You failed them.

34:14.353 --> 34:16.155
I didn't fail anyone. I...

34:16.188 --> 34:17.623
Well, of course
you didn't, Davis.

34:17.656 --> 34:19.425
I-I know, I know that.

34:19.458 --> 34:21.727
Look, I am sorry, okay?
I get emotional.

34:21.760 --> 34:23.862
I have spent my life
working this help line,

34:23.895 --> 34:26.265
and trying to reach
out to people...

34:26.298 --> 34:27.633
Give me a freaking break.

34:27.666 --> 34:29.535
These girls come from nothing.

34:29.568 --> 34:32.438
Okay? They're alone, and
I offered them a way out.

34:32.471 --> 34:33.772
Oh, by abducting
and murdering them?

34:33.805 --> 34:35.374
No.

34:35.407 --> 34:36.742
By being there for them.

34:36.775 --> 34:38.810
I get it. You were like

34:38.844 --> 34:40.512
a safe harbor in a storm.

34:40.546 --> 34:42.614
Precisely.
Think I'm gonna be sick.

34:42.648 --> 34:44.216
Must be frustrating
when they won't accept

34:44.250 --> 34:45.584
what's good for 'em.

34:45.617 --> 34:47.253
It's a disappointment, for sure.

34:47.286 --> 34:49.221
Still, you-you carry on.

34:49.255 --> 34:50.656
No. Dwayne.

34:50.689 --> 34:53.359
He is not a martyr,
these girls are.

34:53.392 --> 34:54.826
You can't forget the girls.

34:54.860 --> 34:57.663
Don't forget them,
you can't forget them.

34:57.696 --> 34:59.331
Don't you see
that all of us want

34:59.365 --> 35:01.600
what's best for those girls?

35:02.834 --> 35:04.370
And if you can't
control yourself,

35:04.403 --> 35:06.405
then you need
to step outside.

35:06.438 --> 35:07.506
Do you understand, Martha?

35:10.509 --> 35:11.643
Yes.

35:11.677 --> 35:13.212
Apologies.

35:13.245 --> 35:15.814
Martha
is very passionate.

35:15.847 --> 35:18.284
And she's disappointed
about Lindsey.

35:19.785 --> 35:20.852
People disappoint.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.462
Lindsey disappoint?

35:34.366 --> 35:35.467
Well, you can't save 'em all.

35:35.501 --> 35:38.370
You have no idea
how hard I tried.

35:39.638 --> 35:41.607
Doesn't matter
anymore.

35:41.640 --> 35:45.911
I'm here and she's gone.

35:45.944 --> 35:48.314
Maybe not.

35:48.347 --> 35:50.382
(paper crinkles)

35:51.483 --> 35:52.784
Look at her.

35:52.818 --> 35:55.621
Shelley Wright, remember her?

35:55.654 --> 35:59.258
We found her,
by the way.

35:59.291 --> 36:01.460
How much time did
you have with Shelley

36:01.493 --> 36:02.794
before she disappointed you?

36:02.828 --> 36:04.530
Few weeks?

36:04.563 --> 36:06.332
Months, maybe?
But...

36:06.365 --> 36:10.369
he only had a couple
of days with Lindsey.

36:11.503 --> 36:13.672
That's not enough time.

36:13.705 --> 36:14.940
I don't think
he really had

36:14.973 --> 36:16.408
a fair shot.

36:16.442 --> 36:17.876
Are you saying that...

36:17.909 --> 36:20.679
you would let me see her again?

36:25.984 --> 36:28.620
Sure.

36:28.654 --> 36:30.822
Sure, why not?

36:30.856 --> 36:31.757
Why not? And this time
it'll be different,

36:31.790 --> 36:32.824
because we'll be with you,

36:32.858 --> 36:34.460
and you...

36:34.493 --> 36:36.562
can show her
how you change.

36:36.595 --> 36:38.264
She'll see that people
can change.

36:38.297 --> 36:40.966
And all you really want to do
is help her.

36:40.999 --> 36:43.569
You just have to show us
where she is.

36:48.407 --> 36:49.575
(siren wailing)

36:54.546 --> 36:56.214
Split up, split up, go.

36:58.884 --> 37:00.619
GREGORIO:
Over here!

37:04.956 --> 37:05.991
Freshly laid.

37:06.024 --> 37:07.393
Airtight.

37:07.426 --> 37:08.460
This is the spot.

37:16.368 --> 37:18.370
(grunting)

37:18.404 --> 37:20.306
Lindsey? Lindsey?

37:20.339 --> 37:21.773
She's alive.

37:21.807 --> 37:23.008
Okay.

37:23.041 --> 37:24.343
Gonna be all right.

37:24.376 --> 37:25.744
I got you.

37:25.777 --> 37:26.912
Okay?
Come on,
I got you.

37:26.945 --> 37:28.314
(grunts)

37:28.347 --> 37:30.015
You got-- go.

37:30.048 --> 37:31.850
(grunting)

37:31.883 --> 37:32.818
Got it?

37:34.620 --> 37:36.622
(siren wailing)

37:44.496 --> 37:45.864
You said I could see her.

37:49.801 --> 37:51.837
You've seen her.

37:51.870 --> 37:53.805
Get him out of here.

37:55.006 --> 37:56.742
(siren wailing)

38:13.091 --> 38:14.860
Is she...?
Alive.

38:14.893 --> 38:17.396
At Ochsner Medical
getting treatment.

38:17.429 --> 38:20.632
She's gonna be okay.

38:21.933 --> 38:24.636
Martha?

38:24.670 --> 38:26.672
Martha, you hear me?
We did it.

38:29.475 --> 38:30.709
It's over.

38:30.742 --> 38:31.810
Thanks to you.

38:33.812 --> 38:36.382
I'm sorry about what went down
in interrogation.

38:36.415 --> 38:37.583
I just saw...

38:37.616 --> 38:39.785
A way in.

38:39.818 --> 38:41.787
And you took it.

38:41.820 --> 38:44.990
No apology necessary.

38:45.023 --> 38:46.825
I-I should be
thanking you, Dwayne.

38:46.858 --> 38:49.628
You got him to talk,
you saved Lindsey.

38:49.661 --> 38:52.431
Well, it wouldn't have happened
without your intel.

38:52.464 --> 38:55.000
Intel isn't much good
if no one's listening.

38:55.033 --> 38:56.768
I didn't have
much choice, did I?

39:00.005 --> 39:02.107
I take it
an apology won't suffice?

39:02.140 --> 39:05.043
It's a start,

39:05.076 --> 39:07.646
but it's gonna take
a little more than that.

39:07.679 --> 39:09.715
You kidnapped
a federal agent.

39:09.748 --> 39:11.850
Sounds really bad
when you put it that way.

39:11.883 --> 39:13.819
Yeah, well...

39:16.488 --> 39:18.089
You need help.

39:18.123 --> 39:19.491
I'm not going to a nut house.

39:19.525 --> 39:20.859
No, you're not.

39:20.892 --> 39:22.928
But you are gonna
get treatment.

39:22.961 --> 39:26.665
No white rooms,
no sensory deprivation.

39:26.698 --> 39:28.934
Just caring psychologists

39:28.967 --> 39:30.902
and the right meds.

39:33.505 --> 39:35.907
Dwayne, I...
No, listen, I...

39:35.941 --> 39:39.578
I trusted you with this case;
time for you to trust me.

39:39.611 --> 39:41.613
Can I keep my police scanner?

39:42.848 --> 39:44.916
I joke.

39:46.985 --> 39:50.756
Thank you... for listening.

39:52.924 --> 39:55.494
Not many people
have done that for me.

39:55.527 --> 39:57.963
You deserve a chance,
too, Martha.

40:00.932 --> 40:03.134
And, hey, next time
you get a hot lead...

40:05.637 --> 40:07.172
...try the phone first.

40:09.107 --> 40:11.943
LASALLE:
Since Pride was technically

40:11.977 --> 40:14.580
working the case all along,
I think this means, uh,

40:14.613 --> 40:16.214
I won our little wager.

40:16.247 --> 40:18.216
Um, he was being forced
to work the case.

40:18.249 --> 40:20.719
Literally had a gun to his head,
or at least an ax.

40:20.752 --> 40:22.588
Listen, forget the bet, Lasalle.

40:22.621 --> 40:23.522
Today we all lost.

40:23.555 --> 40:25.491
How's that?

40:25.524 --> 40:26.858
The one time we get Pride
to put his badge down

40:26.892 --> 40:29.027
for some R&R, he gets kidnapped?

40:29.060 --> 40:31.062
Really?
It's unlikely
we're gonna get him

40:31.096 --> 40:32.964
to leave the squad room
any time soon.

40:38.570 --> 40:40.171
Any reason you two are staring?

40:41.239 --> 40:42.841
Uh, no.

40:42.874 --> 40:45.611
Just trying to figure out
what's going on here.

40:45.644 --> 40:47.479
I'm going back down
to Gulf Shores.

40:47.513 --> 40:49.180
Laurel's already on her way.

40:49.214 --> 40:51.182
Oh, father-daughter trip,
it's...
Still on.

40:51.216 --> 40:53.652
Can't let work
stop you from living.

40:53.685 --> 40:54.853
Or getting kidnapped.

40:54.886 --> 40:56.087
Yeah, well, that...

40:56.121 --> 40:58.524
that was a wake-up call.

40:58.557 --> 41:00.892
That kind of obsession, well,

41:00.926 --> 41:02.828
hit a little bit close to home.

41:02.861 --> 41:04.696
So...
(drawer opens)

41:04.730 --> 41:06.865
(chuckles)

41:06.898 --> 41:10.869
Try not to burn down the place
while I'm away.
