WEBVTT

00:04.482 --> 00:06.702
How many friends do you have?

00:06.745 --> 00:10.967
None better than you.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.664
It's not a trick question.

00:12.708 --> 00:14.057
I'm thinking about
how many people

00:14.101 --> 00:15.754
we should invite
to our wedding.

00:15.798 --> 00:17.234
We could invite
everyone we know,

00:17.278 --> 00:19.758
which is about
150 people.

00:19.802 --> 00:22.935
Or people we actually like,
which is six.

00:22.979 --> 00:23.936
I'm good with six.

00:23.980 --> 00:25.721
On the other hand,

00:25.764 --> 00:26.765
if we're gonna
do the whole shebang,

00:26.809 --> 00:28.071
shouldn't we shebang

00:28.115 --> 00:29.855
in front of
a wildly cheering crowd?

00:29.899 --> 00:31.857
Here's a thought.Mm.

00:31.901 --> 00:34.251
Why don't we find the
perfect place for our wedding

00:34.295 --> 00:36.688
and let that tell us
how many people to invite?

00:36.732 --> 00:38.821
God, you're so practical.

00:38.864 --> 00:41.389
What's wrong with me
that it turns me on?

00:41.432 --> 00:44.957
Hey.Hi. You want me
to make you some breakfast?

00:45.001 --> 00:47.308
Ugh. I have my contracts
class this morning.

00:47.351 --> 00:49.092
No solid food before that.

00:49.136 --> 00:51.094
Oh, is that the professor who
calls you Christy "Flunk-it"?

00:51.138 --> 00:52.965
[sighs]
She thinks she's really clever,

00:53.009 --> 00:55.098
but I heard that
in kindergarten.

00:55.142 --> 00:57.622
I was just trying
to motivate you.

00:57.666 --> 01:00.408
You know, if we get the
guest list down to four,

01:00.451 --> 01:02.410
we could get
married in my car.

01:02.453 --> 01:05.978
That's the most practical thing
I've ever heard.

01:06.022 --> 01:08.111
Take off your pants.

01:11.288 --> 01:13.116
So, um,

01:13.160 --> 01:17.947
the court held
that consequential damages could

01:17.990 --> 01:20.254
only be levied
if both parties

01:20.297 --> 01:23.822
were aware of them
when the contract was made,

01:23.866 --> 01:26.216
and... Hadley

01:26.260 --> 01:28.044
didn't do that to Baxendale,

01:28.088 --> 01:31.613
so, you know...

01:31.656 --> 01:34.703
no bueno.

01:34.746 --> 01:38.620
Well, Flunk-it, that was
a fundamentally correct answer

01:38.663 --> 01:41.275
delivered with the confidence
of a cartoon mouse.

01:41.318 --> 01:43.538
[high-pitched]:
Thank you.

01:43.581 --> 01:45.757
Can someone else
disappoint me

01:45.801 --> 01:48.412
with the particulars
of Sullivan v. O'Connor?

01:48.456 --> 01:50.936
Mr. Hart,
you always make me sad.

01:50.980 --> 01:52.677
Sullivan was an
entertainer...

01:52.721 --> 01:55.463
My hand is shaking
too bad to take notes.

01:55.506 --> 01:56.899
Can I borrow yours?

01:56.942 --> 01:59.075
I'm not taking notes.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.556
I'm writing, "Don't cry,
don't cry, don't cry."

02:03.688 --> 02:05.690
â™ª

02:24.883 --> 02:26.624
I understand
a professor being tough,

02:26.668 --> 02:28.191
but this woman's just mean.

02:28.235 --> 02:30.672
How mean? Like,
on a scale of one to ten,

02:30.715 --> 02:33.109
one being Marjorie,
ten being Bonnie?

02:33.153 --> 02:34.545
Let me put it this way.

02:34.589 --> 02:36.895
Imagine my mother,
but educated.

02:36.939 --> 02:39.289
Ooh.[exclaims]

02:39.333 --> 02:43.119
After my last class,
I sat in my car and just cried.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.034
Then I looked
at the car next to me

02:45.077 --> 02:47.471
and saw another guy
from class crying, too.

02:47.515 --> 02:50.779
He saw me, we laughed a little,

02:50.822 --> 02:53.434
then we went back to crying.

02:54.870 --> 02:57.089
I try to do my crying
right when I wake up,

02:57.133 --> 02:58.656
get it all out of my system.

03:00.136 --> 03:02.443
Until bedtime
when I cry myself to sleep.

03:02.486 --> 03:04.706
Wendy, is everything okay?

03:04.749 --> 03:06.534
Yeah. Never better. Why?

03:06.577 --> 03:08.753
You want my fruit?

03:08.797 --> 03:10.581
You can have my fruit.

03:12.453 --> 03:14.411
Sweetie, if you have time
to cry, you have time

03:14.455 --> 03:16.021
to go to a meeting.

03:16.065 --> 03:17.719
I'm sure there's one
near your school.

03:17.762 --> 03:20.504
I did pass a church with a bunch
of jittery smokers outside.

03:20.548 --> 03:22.158
I'll check that out.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.508
Okay, ladies, forks down.
This is important.

03:24.552 --> 03:27.294
I found the perfect place
for me and Adam to get married.

03:27.337 --> 03:29.165
Finally.
Great.
Wonderful.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.689
Way to sell it.

03:31.733 --> 03:33.343
Anyway, it's this
beautiful garden.

03:33.387 --> 03:35.824
There's a canopy of trees,
it's lousy with flowers,

03:35.867 --> 03:37.826
and-- get this-- there's
an actual babbling brook,

03:37.869 --> 03:39.306
babbling right
through the joint.

03:39.349 --> 03:40.698
It was available
for our date,

03:40.742 --> 03:42.265
and these other people
were sniffing around,

03:42.309 --> 03:43.832
so I booked it
right on the spot.

03:43.875 --> 03:46.226
Take that, bizarrely-
handsome gay couple.

03:48.184 --> 03:50.404
Sounds great.Pay attention.
It's terrible.

03:50.447 --> 03:52.754
She really gives you whiplash,
doesn't she?

03:52.797 --> 03:54.973
I stupidly told Adam that
I cared about his opinion

03:55.017 --> 03:57.019
and wanted him to be
involved in all the plans

03:57.062 --> 03:58.586
and then I made the
most important decision

03:58.629 --> 04:00.805
behind his back.
What should I do?

04:00.849 --> 04:03.286
This is the man you're gonna
marry. Be honest with him.

04:03.330 --> 04:04.853
Not what I'm
looking for. Christy?

04:04.896 --> 04:06.420
I vote truth.Nope.

04:06.463 --> 04:07.508
I would also...Eh.

04:07.551 --> 04:09.336
Truth is for chumps.

04:09.379 --> 04:11.251
I knew I should've
started with you.

04:11.294 --> 04:12.687
In my experience, the best way

04:12.730 --> 04:14.515
to get what you want
from a man

04:14.558 --> 04:16.734
is to make him think
it's his idea.

04:16.778 --> 04:19.302
I've done it with houses,
I've done it with vacations,

04:19.346 --> 04:20.608
I've done it with me.

04:22.305 --> 04:24.481
I'm liking this. Go on.

04:24.525 --> 04:27.179
Take him to the place you like
first. That sets the bar.

04:27.223 --> 04:29.530
Then take him to a couple
of dumps and I guarantee you,

04:29.573 --> 04:32.097
he'll decide he likes the one
you already booked.

04:32.141 --> 04:34.099
Question is, Bonnie,
are you comfortable

04:34.143 --> 04:36.319
being that manipulative?

04:36.363 --> 04:40.323
Or maybe the real question is
why do I waste my breath?

04:40.367 --> 04:43.195
I think you need
the fruit.

04:50.812 --> 04:53.162
[sniffling]

04:53.205 --> 04:55.164
You okay?

04:55.207 --> 04:57.209
I had a really
tough morning.

04:57.253 --> 04:59.995
Well, you're in the right place.

05:00.038 --> 05:02.650
I know. Thank you.
[sniffles]

05:02.693 --> 05:06.480
I'm-I'm just having
such a hard time with...

05:08.220 --> 05:10.222
Oh, no.

05:15.793 --> 05:18.666
BONNIE:
Mmm. I'm still
smelling the jasmine

05:18.709 --> 05:20.668
from that beautiful
garden venue.

05:20.711 --> 05:24.236
But get that out of your mind,
because here we are

05:24.280 --> 05:28.589
at the historic
Marino and Sons Barrelworks.

05:28.632 --> 05:30.678
It's kind of cool.

05:30.721 --> 05:32.723
I agree, not good.

05:34.421 --> 05:36.379
Oh, I like the high ceilings.

05:36.423 --> 05:38.512
Yeah, but...

05:38.555 --> 05:41.471
it used to be a barrel factory.

05:41.515 --> 05:43.212
I'm marrying a woman
who used to be a coke fiend.

05:43.255 --> 05:46.215
Clearly, what something
used to be doesn't bother me.

05:46.258 --> 05:48.043
Fair enough.

05:48.086 --> 05:49.610
The brick walls
are great.

05:49.653 --> 05:51.263
Yeah, until I scrape up
against them

05:51.307 --> 05:54.049
and bleed all over
my wedding dress.

05:54.092 --> 05:55.659
That's right, I'm wearing white,
and our first dance

05:55.703 --> 05:57.618
is to "Boogie Wonderland."
Moving on.

05:59.446 --> 06:03.363
I tell you, Bonnie,
this has good bones.

06:03.406 --> 06:05.887
We could hang some lights
across those exposed beams.

06:05.930 --> 06:08.368
[scoffs]
Now we're providing
our own lighting?

06:08.411 --> 06:12.023
Why don't I also build a robot
to marry us?

06:12.067 --> 06:14.983
I mean, I wasn't totally sold
on the beautiful garden,

06:15.026 --> 06:16.637
but at least
they have their own lights,

06:16.680 --> 06:19.117
and-- I don't know-- flowers
and babbling brook.

06:19.161 --> 06:21.206
I liked the garden.

06:21.250 --> 06:23.687
All right, so we're narrowed
down. It's the fairy tale garden

06:23.731 --> 06:27.212
or the serial killer's
workspace.

06:27.256 --> 06:29.171
Well...

06:29.214 --> 06:31.347
I'm pretty seriously
leaning towards the garden.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.131
Well, if you feel
that strongly about it, Adam,

06:33.175 --> 06:35.046
I'll give it to you.
Garden it is.

06:35.090 --> 06:37.919
Great. So should I call them
and book it?

06:37.962 --> 06:40.748
No, no. You chose,
I'll take care of the details.

06:40.791 --> 06:42.619
Thanks, honey.

06:42.663 --> 06:44.404
You're the best.

06:51.802 --> 06:55.371
ALL:
...cannot change, the courage
to change the things I can,

06:55.415 --> 06:59.331
and the wisdom to know
the difference. Amen.

07:05.294 --> 07:07.775
Uh, excuse me,
Professor?

07:09.124 --> 07:11.300
I just wanted to say hello.

07:11.343 --> 07:13.389
Nice to know we're
on the same path.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.738
And you are?

07:14.782 --> 07:18.742
Christy from your
contracts class.

07:18.786 --> 07:19.700
You call me
"Flunk-it."

07:19.743 --> 07:21.702
Oh, sure.

07:21.745 --> 07:23.965
I thought you were taller.

07:24.008 --> 07:27.272
Um, if it makes you
uncomfortable to have a student

07:27.316 --> 07:29.927
in the meeting with you,
I can find another one.

07:29.971 --> 07:32.364
No, don't worry
about it.Are you sure?

07:32.408 --> 07:34.105
Yeah, I'm not
coming back anyway.

07:34.149 --> 07:36.064
Okay.

07:36.107 --> 07:38.632
Wait.

07:38.675 --> 07:41.635
I know it isn't any of
my business, but can I ask why?

07:41.678 --> 07:43.767
Because I'm fine.

07:43.811 --> 07:45.639
I haven't had a drink
in over six months.

07:45.682 --> 07:47.423
I've been to a handful
of meetings,

07:47.467 --> 07:50.426
and I'm always asking myself
why am I wasting my time

07:50.470 --> 07:53.385
listening to people
like you? No offense.

07:53.429 --> 07:56.388
Actually, that's one of the
nicer things you've said to me.

07:56.432 --> 07:58.739
Look, when I drink,
terrible things happen,

07:58.782 --> 08:01.611
so I get I can't drink anymore.
I'm good with that.

08:01.655 --> 08:03.787
What I'm not good with
is sitting in a circle,

08:03.831 --> 08:06.181
talking about feelings
and reciting a prayer

08:06.224 --> 08:08.618
that my mother had crocheted
on a kitchen towel.

08:08.662 --> 08:11.447
You're lucky. My mom
didn't have kitchen towels.

08:11.491 --> 08:14.102
For most of my childhood,
we didn't have a kitchen.

08:14.145 --> 08:15.451
[laughs]

08:15.495 --> 08:17.584
My mom's a drunk, too.

08:17.627 --> 08:19.629
That's too bad.

08:19.673 --> 08:22.545
Um, listen, I came here today

08:22.589 --> 08:24.808
because I thought
it would help, and it didn't.

08:24.852 --> 08:27.245
That happens to me sometimes.

08:27.289 --> 08:28.769
Then I go out for coffee after

08:28.812 --> 08:32.642
with my friends from the
program, and it gets better.

08:32.686 --> 08:36.037
I like that.
We're going for coffee.

08:36.080 --> 08:39.083
That'd be great,
Professor Stevens.

08:39.127 --> 08:41.651
Call me Natalie.

08:42.870 --> 08:45.350
Going for coffee,
calling her Natalie.

08:45.394 --> 08:47.396
[laughs]

08:49.093 --> 08:50.704
Not my coat.

08:52.836 --> 08:55.665
Mom, are you here?

08:55.709 --> 08:57.580
Hello! How was your day?

08:57.624 --> 08:59.103
Amazing! How was yours?!

08:59.147 --> 09:01.845
Amazing!Are we both
in good moods?

09:01.889 --> 09:04.369
Oh, my God,
that never happens.It never happens.

09:04.413 --> 09:06.197
What do we do?I think we're
doing it.

09:06.241 --> 09:07.808
You go first.No, you go first.

09:07.851 --> 09:11.115
Manipulation works,
honesty jerks.

09:11.159 --> 09:13.248
Help me know what that means.

09:13.291 --> 09:16.338
I tricked Adam, and we're
getting married in the garden.

09:16.381 --> 09:18.253
Awesome!And what's your good news?

09:18.296 --> 09:20.603
My professor's a drunk!

09:20.647 --> 09:22.605
Help me know what that means.

09:22.649 --> 09:25.913
I went to a meeting today, and
my horrible professor was there,

09:25.956 --> 09:28.785
we had coffee, and it turns
out she doesn't hate me,

09:28.829 --> 09:30.352
she's just super broken.

09:30.395 --> 09:32.354
Oh, that's great, honey!

09:32.397 --> 09:34.399
Not for her, but, yeah!

09:34.443 --> 09:37.185
We talked for an hour, and now
I think we're kind of friends.

09:37.228 --> 09:39.491
[whoops]
Friends?Yeah.

09:39.535 --> 09:42.625
Oh, good. You guys
are here. I'm so happy!

09:42.669 --> 09:44.061
Us, too!Where you been?

09:44.105 --> 09:45.802
I bought the barrel factory!

09:45.846 --> 09:47.804
What?

09:47.848 --> 09:50.024
Help me know
what that means.

09:50.067 --> 09:51.808
I'm gonna turn it into a bar.

09:51.852 --> 09:55.029
Are you out
of your frickin' mind?!

09:55.072 --> 09:57.553
I think our good mood is over.

10:04.734 --> 10:06.562
You're opening a bar?
That's so exciting.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.304
Is it, Christy?
Is it?

10:09.347 --> 10:11.219
Let's talk later.
I have ideas.

10:12.742 --> 10:15.397
Okay, I know
this was a little impulsive.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.660
Maybe it's my fault. We didn't
have a rule. So here it is.

10:17.704 --> 10:19.314
If either one of us goes insane
and wants

10:19.357 --> 10:21.882
to spend over $100,000,
we shoot the other a text.

10:21.925 --> 10:25.407
You don't have any money.Okay, then, this rule
is just for you.

10:25.450 --> 10:27.627
I don't know
what to tell you, Bonnie.

10:27.670 --> 10:29.498
I fell in love with the place.

10:29.541 --> 10:31.892
You weren't supposed to love it,
you were supposed to hate it.

10:31.935 --> 10:33.067
What's that mean?

10:34.546 --> 10:36.636
Be right up.

10:36.679 --> 10:38.420
My daughter needs me.

10:38.463 --> 10:41.553
Why was I not supposed to fall
in love with my barrel factory?

10:41.597 --> 10:44.208
Forget it, poor choice of words.I know when you're lying.

10:44.252 --> 10:46.994
You do? I don't even know
when I'm lying.Bonnie.

10:49.039 --> 10:51.563
Okay.

10:51.607 --> 10:53.217
Maybe...

10:55.611 --> 10:58.658
I already saw
the beautiful garden

10:58.701 --> 11:00.703
with the babbling brook
yesterday

11:00.747 --> 11:03.314
and got my heart set
on getting married there.

11:03.358 --> 11:05.708
Why didn't you
just tell me that?

11:05.752 --> 11:08.885
Because stupid Jill...

11:08.929 --> 11:12.497
told me it would be better
if you thought it was your idea.

11:12.541 --> 11:14.021
[chuckling]:
Why?

11:14.064 --> 11:17.938
Because I had already
kind of booked the garden

11:17.981 --> 11:20.114
before you saw it.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.944
Wait a minute.

11:23.987 --> 11:26.511
You're getting mad at me for
making a decision without you

11:26.555 --> 11:28.557
when you've already
made a decision without me.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.733
Yeah, don't compare
our decisions.

11:30.777 --> 11:33.475
Yours was momentous,
mine was whimsical.

11:33.518 --> 11:36.434
Well, at least
I didn't lie about it.

11:36.478 --> 11:38.132
That is a serious
breach of trust.

11:38.175 --> 11:39.655
Oh, don't talk to me
about trust.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.135
You said you were
gonna go wash your car,

11:41.178 --> 11:43.093
but instead you bought a bar.

11:43.137 --> 11:45.705
You know, I was having a
great day till I came over here.

11:45.748 --> 11:47.750
Well, so was I.Fine, I'm going home.

11:47.794 --> 11:51.536
Are you? Or are you really going
to buy an abandoned Petco

11:51.580 --> 11:53.930
and make it
a discotheque?

11:57.455 --> 11:59.109
The court held
that the advertisement

11:59.153 --> 12:00.632
was a unilateral contract

12:00.676 --> 12:02.591
and that the defendant
required notice

12:02.634 --> 12:04.941
that the plaintiff
had purchased their product.

12:04.985 --> 12:07.988
Magnificently wrong.

12:08.031 --> 12:09.772
If I didn't have a mortgage,
I would quit teaching

12:09.816 --> 12:12.427
at this very moment.

12:12.470 --> 12:17.084
Ms. Plunkett, can you, again,
lead us down the right track?

12:17.127 --> 12:20.043
I sure can.

12:20.087 --> 12:22.654
The court found that
no notice was required

12:22.698 --> 12:24.265
because it was
a mass advertisement.

12:24.308 --> 12:27.964
Yes! Thank you.
You are a beacon of hope

12:28.008 --> 12:31.751
in a room full of budding
ambulance chasers.

12:33.883 --> 12:36.973
I'm available for tutoring
if you need it.

12:37.017 --> 12:38.801
All right,

12:38.845 --> 12:41.021
that is all the incompetence
I can stand for today.

12:41.064 --> 12:42.674
Class dismissed.

12:42.718 --> 12:46.200
Ms. Plunkett,
can I have a moment?Absolutely.

12:46.243 --> 12:48.593
And the rest of you--
if you are planning on

12:48.637 --> 12:51.988
being ignorant tomorrow,
just go to a movie.

12:52.032 --> 12:55.818
Excuse me, excuse me,
professor needs me.

12:55.862 --> 12:57.602
Excuse me.

12:57.646 --> 12:59.779
Oh, great class today.

12:59.822 --> 13:01.345
White-hot.

13:01.389 --> 13:04.218
So my ex said that we were
gonna have dinner tonight,

13:04.261 --> 13:05.828
and that made me feel
like there was hope,

13:05.872 --> 13:08.135
but then he just texted me
that something came up,

13:08.178 --> 13:10.398
and I think it's someone and I
didn't even want to be with him,

13:10.441 --> 13:12.966
but I am afraid
I'm gonna be alone forever.

13:14.184 --> 13:16.230
Yeah.

13:17.753 --> 13:19.059
I bet if we hustle,

13:19.102 --> 13:21.148
we can make the 12:30 meeting.

13:21.191 --> 13:23.541
Oh, I would rather
just talk to you.

13:23.585 --> 13:24.978
Let's go grab some coffee.

13:25.021 --> 13:27.241
Okay, but I only have an hour.

13:27.284 --> 13:29.809
I have three cases to read
for this class.

13:29.852 --> 13:31.898
I just won't call on you.
Problem solved.

13:31.941 --> 13:33.508
But I should still
do the reading, right?

13:33.551 --> 13:35.162
I don't care.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.209
Is Adam inviting
his stuntman friends

13:39.253 --> 13:41.516
to the wedding?Oh, good question.

13:41.559 --> 13:43.866
I'll have a year sober
at that point

13:43.910 --> 13:45.781
and random sex will be
back on the table.

13:47.261 --> 13:50.873
Not literally.
Maybe.

13:50.917 --> 13:53.049
I'm not even sure
there's gonna be a wedding.

13:53.093 --> 13:56.313
Oh, come on, Bonnie, you're
not canceling the wedding

13:56.357 --> 13:58.228
because Adam
bought a bar.

13:58.272 --> 14:01.188
Can I cancel the wedding
because he's a dumbass?

14:01.231 --> 14:03.277
You know, he never
would've found that place

14:03.320 --> 14:05.061
if you didn't trick him
with that whole garden thing.

14:05.105 --> 14:07.324
That was Jill's fault.My fault?

14:07.368 --> 14:09.196
You never take a guy
to an old factory.

14:09.239 --> 14:11.241
Guys love
old factories.

14:11.285 --> 14:12.503
MARJORIE:
Christy's right.

14:12.547 --> 14:14.070
This did start with you, Bonnie,

14:14.114 --> 14:16.246
you've got to take
some responsibility.

14:16.290 --> 14:18.422
[chuckling]

14:18.466 --> 14:21.338
What?I was just trying
to picture you doing that.

14:21.382 --> 14:23.558
[phone rings]

14:25.125 --> 14:28.041
Oh, no, it's my professor.

14:28.084 --> 14:30.260
I thought you liked
being teacher's pet.

14:30.304 --> 14:33.742
I do. I don't like
being teacher's therapist.

14:33.785 --> 14:35.962
She calls me constantly
just to vent.

14:36.005 --> 14:39.748
Oh, really? What
must that be like?

14:39.791 --> 14:42.925
She is an arrogant,
opinionated hot mess

14:42.969 --> 14:45.188
who gets along with no one.
You'd like her.

14:45.232 --> 14:47.887
Can't you just tell her
to go to a meeting?

14:47.930 --> 14:49.366
That's what this one
always does.

14:49.410 --> 14:51.934
Or you could tell her
to "take responsibility."

14:51.978 --> 14:53.588
You know, the more
childish you get,

14:53.631 --> 14:55.155
the more I know
I got to you.

14:55.198 --> 14:58.506
Bip, bip, bip, bip, bip, bip,
bip, bip. [gags]

15:01.204 --> 15:03.990
I keep telling her to go
to meetings. She won't go.

15:04.033 --> 15:06.035
I feel like I'm the only thing
keeping her sober.

15:06.079 --> 15:09.256
Ooh, red flag,
red flag. May I?

15:09.299 --> 15:11.432
Please. I have to
take my vitamins.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.871
No one person can keep
another person sober.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.960
You can carry the message,
but not the mess.

15:18.004 --> 15:20.006
I'm sorry,
did she pick you?

15:21.442 --> 15:23.705
But, you guys,
since I've been helping her,

15:23.748 --> 15:25.098
she's been nice to me.

15:25.141 --> 15:26.969
I haven't cried
in my car all week.

15:27.013 --> 15:29.015
So you're using
each other.

15:29.058 --> 15:32.279
Well, it is a contracts class.

15:32.322 --> 15:35.456
Christy, you can't be
this woman's sobriety,

15:35.499 --> 15:37.806
and you certainly can't
help someone stay sober

15:37.849 --> 15:40.678
to benefit yourself.

15:40.722 --> 15:42.637
You would not
be in the wrong right now

15:42.680 --> 15:46.162
to go,
"Bip, bip, bip, bip, bip."

15:50.079 --> 15:52.255
Hey, Natalie.Hey.

15:52.299 --> 15:54.649
We are definitely going
for coffee after class.

15:54.692 --> 15:57.130
I think I had phone sex
with my ex last night.

15:57.173 --> 15:59.219
Actually...I mean,

15:59.262 --> 16:02.309
he called me while I was in the
tub-- what was I supposed to do?

16:02.352 --> 16:05.399
I was hoping to make
that meeting after class.

16:05.442 --> 16:08.793
Ugh, you and those meetings.
You're better than those people.

16:08.837 --> 16:11.318
No, I'm not.
I am those people.

16:11.361 --> 16:13.363
And I really need
those meetings.

16:13.407 --> 16:15.800
Why? You seem totally together.

16:15.844 --> 16:17.977
[scoffs]

16:18.020 --> 16:20.762
Sorry, no one's ever
said that to me before.

16:20.805 --> 16:23.199
Do you want to go
to coffee or not?

16:23.243 --> 16:26.811
I think I don't.

16:26.855 --> 16:29.379
Great.

16:29.423 --> 16:32.339
I've come to rely on you,
and now you're bailing on me.

16:32.382 --> 16:35.342
I'm not bailing,
it's just...

16:35.385 --> 16:38.998
I don't think I can be
who you want me to be.

16:39.041 --> 16:40.521
I don't think
any one person can.

16:40.564 --> 16:42.392
No, of course.
That's a job

16:42.436 --> 16:44.655
for a bunch of losers
in a church basement.

16:44.699 --> 16:47.180
We like to think of ourselves
as former losers.

16:48.616 --> 16:51.010
Anyway, I...

16:51.053 --> 16:53.360
I can't tell you what to do,

16:53.403 --> 16:55.666
but I can only tell you
what worked for me.

16:56.928 --> 16:58.495
Meetings not only

16:58.539 --> 16:59.888
help me stay sober,

16:59.931 --> 17:02.108
but they also keep me sane.

17:02.151 --> 17:04.545
I understand what you're saying.

17:04.588 --> 17:05.546
You do?

17:05.589 --> 17:07.069
Absolutely. [chuckles]

17:07.113 --> 17:09.245
Take your seat.

17:09.289 --> 17:11.552
I hope we can still be...

17:11.595 --> 17:13.510
I said take your seat.

17:16.122 --> 17:18.820
And I hope, for your sake,
you did the reading.

17:24.739 --> 17:27.524
Hey, Matt,
there he is.

17:27.568 --> 17:30.484
Are those
new glasses?

17:30.527 --> 17:33.835
Hey, uh, so, um, can I, uh,
borrow your notes?

17:37.447 --> 17:39.536
So I'm thinking,
if we put the bar here,

17:39.580 --> 17:43.105
we put the flat screens
there, there, there, there,

17:43.149 --> 17:45.977
there, there, there.

17:46.021 --> 17:47.327
How about there?

17:47.370 --> 17:50.417
Don't go crazy.[laughs]

17:50.460 --> 17:52.941
Oh, hey.

17:52.984 --> 17:55.509
Got a minute?

17:55.552 --> 17:57.859
Excuse us.

17:57.902 --> 17:59.904
Sure.

18:01.689 --> 18:03.386
What's up?

18:03.430 --> 18:06.520
I owe you an apology.

18:08.435 --> 18:11.438
Yes, you made a massive decision

18:11.481 --> 18:13.483
that will alter the course
of our lives forever,

18:13.527 --> 18:15.833
but I had a little oopsie
of my own.

18:15.877 --> 18:19.446
Which was?

18:19.489 --> 18:22.449
Wow, you're gonna
rake me over the coals.

18:22.492 --> 18:26.017
Fine. I should've told you
I booked the garden venue

18:26.061 --> 18:27.497
instead of tricking you.

18:27.541 --> 18:29.456
Thank you.

18:29.499 --> 18:31.545
But in my defense,
if I didn't trick you,

18:31.588 --> 18:33.112
you wouldn't have
this amazing new bar

18:33.155 --> 18:35.897
that I look forward
to not drinking in.

18:37.942 --> 18:40.467
You'll be happy to hear
I'm naming it Bonnie's Place.

18:40.510 --> 18:41.729
Really?

18:41.772 --> 18:42.773
No. [laughs]

18:45.080 --> 18:47.648
You can't name a bar
after a fall-down drunk.

18:47.691 --> 18:49.650
That's... that's bad luck.

18:49.693 --> 18:53.480
Yeah, like that hasn't worked
out for every Irish bar ever,

18:53.523 --> 18:55.482
but go on.

18:55.525 --> 18:59.050
I should've
talked to you before I,

18:59.094 --> 19:00.965
you know...

19:01.009 --> 19:03.098
blew through my life savings.

19:05.013 --> 19:08.930
Well, that answers my
next question. [sighs]

19:08.973 --> 19:11.628
I know,
it's crazy, but...

19:13.891 --> 19:15.719
You got to understand--
I've been kind of lost

19:15.763 --> 19:19.549
in the career department
since...

19:19.593 --> 19:21.334
this happened,

19:21.377 --> 19:24.728
and the minute we came in here,

19:24.772 --> 19:28.341
I could see a bar with good food
and happy people

19:28.384 --> 19:31.387
and me going from table to table

19:31.431 --> 19:33.433
acting like I own the place...

19:34.999 --> 19:36.262
...'cause I do.

19:37.872 --> 19:40.657
But you know what
the best part is?

19:42.529 --> 19:45.619
Coming home to you and saying,

19:45.662 --> 19:48.448
"Hi, honey.

19:48.491 --> 19:51.494
I had the best day at work."

19:55.281 --> 19:57.457
All right, I'm in.

19:57.500 --> 20:00.460
But you at least
have to name a drink after me.

20:00.503 --> 20:02.505
What would be in it?

20:03.550 --> 20:05.682
Everything.

20:06.944 --> 20:08.337
Done.

20:16.040 --> 20:18.913
Hi, I'm Christy,
and I'm an alcoholic.

20:18.956 --> 20:20.262
ALL:
Hi, Christy.

20:20.306 --> 20:22.177
I've been trying, lately,
to help someone

20:22.221 --> 20:24.092
see the value of this program,

20:24.135 --> 20:28.052
but they weren't interested
in what I had to say.

20:28.096 --> 20:31.969
The good news is this person's
disapproval used to destroy me,

20:32.013 --> 20:33.493
but it doesn't anymore.

20:33.536 --> 20:36.583
I haven't cried
in my car in a week.

20:36.626 --> 20:39.238
That's huge.

20:39.281 --> 20:41.022
And it's because of you guys.

20:41.065 --> 20:43.503
[sighs]
And maybe someday that person

20:43.546 --> 20:45.200
will come walking
through that door,

20:45.244 --> 20:47.246
but it's not up to me.

20:47.289 --> 20:49.030
I've completely let it go.

20:49.073 --> 20:50.988
[door opens]

20:51.772 --> 20:52.773
Aw.

20:53.687 --> 20:55.645
I mean, hey!
