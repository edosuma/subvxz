00:01.001 --> 00:02.461
<i>Previously on </i>Z Nation...

00:02.544 --> 00:04.505
I didn't do nothing. No! Oh!

00:04.838 --> 00:07.090
[man] <i>A new world is rising
from the ashes of the old.</i>

00:07.758 --> 00:09.885
<i>A better world. Zona.</i>

00:11.220 --> 00:12.888
Zona? Zona's real?

00:12.971 --> 00:14.473
<i>They're the only one with enough power.</i>

00:14.556 --> 00:17.142
- I'm looking for a Doctor Teller.
- What do they want with you?

00:17.226 --> 00:19.895
We were able to stop the virus,
but the side effects were too horrible.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.564
<i>They are losing their immunity
and starting to turn,</i>

00:22.648 --> 00:23.941
<i>including the founder of Zona.</i>

00:24.024 --> 00:25.734
Forget about humanity, Warren. It's over.

00:25.817 --> 00:27.486
Where are you going?

00:27.569 --> 00:29.112
To start a new world.

00:29.196 --> 00:32.824
We are going to stop Murphy
from creating his damn race of Blends.

00:32.908 --> 00:34.451
[Murphy]
I think I'll call her Lucy.

00:34.743 --> 00:37.120
Murphy has a child?
She could've inherited his immunity.

00:37.204 --> 00:39.373
We gotta get to Lucy before Murphy does.

00:39.456 --> 00:41.959
The Man has Lucy?
Help me, Warren.

00:44.127 --> 00:45.420
This ends right now.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.345
Addy!

01:48.483 --> 01:50.736
[distant grunting and snarling]

02:01.622 --> 02:04.124
[screaming]

02:27.522 --> 02:29.483
[screaming]

02:37.532 --> 02:39.451
[screams]

02:49.628 --> 02:50.962
[gagging]

04:44.701 --> 04:47.037
[screaming]

05:19.319 --> 05:22.489
Well... look who's back in town.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.659
Murphy?

05:25.742 --> 05:28.620
Holy zompocalypse, I cannot believe it.

05:28.703 --> 05:30.163
I thought you'd never wake up.

05:30.247 --> 05:32.624
I mean, literally.
I thought you were dead.

05:32.707 --> 05:34.334
Would you excuse us?

05:37.546 --> 05:42.509
-What the hell, Warren? Are you okay?
-Not sure.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.678
I love what you're doing
with the hair here.

05:46.346 --> 05:50.183
You... you-- you aren't blue.

05:50.267 --> 05:54.145
I'm cured, baby. Apparently you are, too.

05:54.229 --> 05:57.816
You know the bullet that wounded you?
Passed through me first.

05:57.899 --> 06:00.610
Looks like a little Murphy blood
is good for what ails ya.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.612
What?

06:02.696 --> 06:04.864
How? What? Where are we?

06:05.824 --> 06:08.118
-You're not gonna believe it.
-Are we dead?

06:08.201 --> 06:11.621
[chuckles]
No. We are very much alive.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.331
What about everyone else?

06:15.792 --> 06:18.003
-You've been gone a long time.
-Gone?

06:18.086 --> 06:19.462
What do you mean by gone?

06:20.880 --> 06:22.340
You've been in a coma.

06:24.426 --> 06:25.635
A coma?

06:26.761 --> 06:28.972
[wails and gasps]

06:29.055 --> 06:30.473
I was dreaming.

06:31.641 --> 06:34.811
Terrible nightmares. How long?

06:34.894 --> 06:36.730
In the coma?

06:36.813 --> 06:38.773
Two years.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.234
Two years?

06:46.239 --> 06:47.324
The others?

06:48.450 --> 06:51.620
Doc? 10K? Addy?

06:53.455 --> 06:54.497
Lucy?

06:56.833 --> 06:57.917
They, uh...

07:00.545 --> 07:02.047
They didn't-- didn't make it.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.307
Goddamn Apocalypse.

07:19.022 --> 07:20.023
-Help me.
-Okay, okay.

07:20.106 --> 07:21.858
Just take it easy.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.110
You haven't use these gams in two years.

07:24.194 --> 07:26.738
I need to move. I got to get out of here.

07:26.821 --> 07:29.366
[laughs] There's nowhere to go.

07:29.449 --> 07:32.661
You know, the Apocalypse got a lot worse
while you were napping.

07:32.744 --> 07:35.622
There's nothing left in the old world
but rotting Zs

07:35.705 --> 07:38.291
-and the last of a few Enders.
-Where are we?

07:39.876 --> 07:41.920
You really don't know, do you?

07:44.214 --> 07:45.256
Surface, please.

07:45.340 --> 07:48.176
[female voice]
<i>Of course. Right away, Mr. Murphy.</i>

07:48.259 --> 07:50.345
The elevator knows your name?

07:50.428 --> 07:53.264
Around here, everyone knows my name.

07:55.433 --> 07:57.727
-[lilting instrumental music playing]
-Welcome to Zona.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.855
[chuckles] Bitchin', right?

08:10.407 --> 08:13.785
What's wrong, Roberta? Smile.
We made it.

08:15.954 --> 08:17.497
We beat the Apocalypse.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.459
-We lived.
-I know.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.797
I just can't believe they're all dead.

08:27.674 --> 08:30.468
I didn't want to believe it myself.

08:30.552 --> 08:33.930
But from what I hear about how bad
things have gotten in the old world,

08:34.014 --> 08:36.016
they're probably better off dead.

08:36.099 --> 08:38.018
I miss them everyday.

08:38.101 --> 08:41.354
Even 10K. Can you believe that?

08:43.815 --> 08:44.941
But, hey...

08:47.360 --> 08:49.946
We're alive.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.490
Feel that sunshine on your face?

08:52.574 --> 08:55.910
We owe it to everyone who didn't make it
to enjoy every second of that.

08:58.997 --> 09:01.750
Come on. Let me give you a tour.

09:01.833 --> 09:03.877
I'm gonna need some clothes.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.629
Don't worry.
Thursdays are clothing-optional day.

09:06.713 --> 09:07.839
Follow me.

09:13.178 --> 09:16.806
Thursdays?
They have the days of the week here?

09:16.890 --> 09:18.266
[chuckles]

09:19.309 --> 09:23.646
I haven't known
the days of the week for...

09:23.730 --> 09:25.440
eight years.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.984
Can that really be true?
Eight years since Day One?

09:28.068 --> 09:29.486
I know. Can you believe it?

09:29.569 --> 09:33.281
We've got all seven days here,
just like pre-Z.

09:33.364 --> 09:36.534
They've got everything here.
Except zombies.

09:36.618 --> 09:40.497
And the clap. They got rid of the clap.
[laughs] I love this place.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.041
Madam.

09:49.839 --> 09:52.383
-Morning, Murphy.
-Morning, Chester. How's the ankle?

09:52.467 --> 09:54.594
I tried that CBD oil
like you said. Amazing.

09:54.677 --> 09:55.678
Excellent.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.889
-Oola says hello!
-Oh, tell her I said hi!

10:00.058 --> 10:01.935
You're awfully quiet over there.

10:02.018 --> 10:04.479
Just taking it all in.

10:04.562 --> 10:05.897
-Murph!
-Hey!

10:05.980 --> 10:08.024
When are you joining us for that foursome?

10:08.108 --> 10:10.110
Soon. I promise. I swear.

10:10.193 --> 10:12.779
-Don't make us force you like last time.
-[laughs] Right?

10:15.824 --> 10:17.534
What?

10:17.617 --> 10:20.328
Tennis. We play tennis. Doubles?

10:20.411 --> 10:21.579
Mm-hmm.

10:21.746 --> 10:23.414
Yeah, "mm-hmm."
We have tennis here.

10:23.498 --> 10:28.837
Like real people. And golf.
And bowling. And it's all free.

10:28.920 --> 10:31.256
Everything's free
when you're with the Murph.

10:31.339 --> 10:35.260
Man, I can't go two years in a coma
without you going batshit crazy.

10:35.343 --> 10:38.972
Look, I can't help it
if these people owe me their lives.

10:39.055 --> 10:42.517
Hey. So the vaccine worked?

10:42.600 --> 10:44.227
Of course, it worked.

10:44.310 --> 10:48.231
With my blood and the best scientists
that Bitcoin can buy...

10:48.314 --> 10:49.732
what could go wrong?

10:55.196 --> 10:57.782
Yeah.

10:57.866 --> 10:59.576
Remnants of civilization.

11:01.119 --> 11:04.330
Zona is like a giant museum of humanity.

11:04.414 --> 11:08.543
I mean, they saved as much as they could.
The best of the best of everything.

11:09.752 --> 11:12.088
Oh, don't touch it. Don't lean on that.

11:12.172 --> 11:15.508
That's the last remaining
Elvis Eagle suit.

11:15.592 --> 11:17.135
It's like living history.

11:17.218 --> 11:19.387
I mean, over here
they have Marilyn Monroe's dress,

11:19.470 --> 11:23.892
and a Gutenberg Bible,
and the last case of Pop Rocks.

11:23.975 --> 11:25.560
Oh, come here. I want to show you this.

11:41.618 --> 11:42.827
Murphy?

11:51.377 --> 11:53.421
Excuse me. I'm gonna need
to see your barcode.

11:54.881 --> 11:55.965
Barcode?

12:05.558 --> 12:06.809
Please.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.482
No code. Security Detail 142.
We have a possible UN-VAX on G deck.

12:16.277 --> 12:18.196
-Something wrong?
-It's okay!

12:18.279 --> 12:20.365
It's okay, she's with me.

12:20.448 --> 12:23.910
-Mr. Murphy, we didn't realize...
-It's cool. It's cool.

12:23.993 --> 12:26.788
This is Roberta Warren.

12:26.871 --> 12:29.123
-General Warren?
-The one and only.

12:29.207 --> 12:33.336
I am so sorry. I had no idea.
We thought you were in a coma.

12:33.419 --> 12:36.339
It's okay. I just woke up.

12:36.422 --> 12:37.882
-[chuckles]
-Today.

12:37.966 --> 12:41.010
-Sorry for the inconvenience.
-No problem.

12:43.054 --> 12:44.389
General Warren?

12:44.472 --> 12:47.225
You were in a coma.
I embellished a little.

12:47.308 --> 12:48.518
-Murphy.
-What?

12:48.601 --> 12:50.687
I wanted to make sure
they took good care of you.

12:57.986 --> 13:01.948
Zona must be treating you right.
You cleaned up nice.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.074
-You look handsome.
-You look pretty hot yourself.

13:04.826 --> 13:07.495
Thanks.

13:07.578 --> 13:10.832
I never trusted these things.
I like a man behind the wheel.

13:10.915 --> 13:13.960
[chuckles] Relax.
I can't wait for you to meet The Founder.

13:15.545 --> 13:16.629
Zona's his baby.

13:16.713 --> 13:18.840
He started prepping for this thing
back in the '80s.

13:18.923 --> 13:22.218
He saw it all coming, you know,
back before it was all coming.

13:22.301 --> 13:25.555
Well, even paranoid whack-jobs
get it right sometimes.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.349
He's the one who was sending people
like our old friend, The Man,

13:28.433 --> 13:30.476
to collect scientists from the Apocalypse.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.395
You mean kidnap.

13:32.478 --> 13:33.813
Potato. Potato.

13:33.896 --> 13:36.774
You know, say what you will
about the behavior of his employees,

13:36.858 --> 13:39.444
The Founder saved
what's left of civilization.

13:39.527 --> 13:42.280
Without him... all this wouldn't be here.

13:42.363 --> 13:44.490
My blood, his vaccine...

13:44.574 --> 13:45.825
He saved humanity.

13:45.908 --> 13:50.246
Or at least the richest 0.0001%
of humanity.

13:50.329 --> 13:52.415
And us.

13:52.498 --> 13:55.293
What about the rest of the planet?

13:55.376 --> 13:57.128
It was too late.

13:57.211 --> 13:59.756
I mean, look around, Warren.
It's a small boat.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.299
Can't save everyone.

14:08.097 --> 14:09.265
[snarling]

14:32.580 --> 14:36.376
Now is the time for all good men
to kill some puppies and kittens.

15:11.744 --> 15:12.995
10K? It's Doc!

15:13.079 --> 15:15.665
Doc? What the hell?
I could've killed you.

15:15.748 --> 15:18.000
-[snarling]
-This way!

15:21.629 --> 15:23.881
-Sorry about that, Doc.
-That's okay, kid.

15:23.965 --> 15:27.427
It's gonna take more than a headbutt
to bring this ol' Billy Goat down.

15:27.510 --> 15:31.013
You know, I've never been tree camping.
Pretty nice little setup you got here.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.640
Thanks. We call it home.

15:36.519 --> 15:39.689
Hold still. I don't want to get
the Z-weed sap in your eye.

15:39.772 --> 15:43.067
Yeah, yeah, can I get
a little bit of that? Another squeeze?

15:43.151 --> 15:46.487
Yeah, just one more.
Mm-hmm. Thank you, darlin'.

15:48.072 --> 15:51.784
Sure is good to see you both.
How long has it been? About a year?

15:51.868 --> 15:54.036
Um, almost two.

15:54.120 --> 15:57.290
-Time flies when you're killing Zs.
-So, what brings you out here?

15:57.373 --> 15:59.625
Well, actually,
I've been looking for you two.

15:59.709 --> 16:02.211
This is about some mission to find Murphy?

16:02.295 --> 16:05.089
-Oh, no, no, no, hell no.
-That bite still hurts.

16:05.173 --> 16:07.800
-Mmm.
-Let him finish.

16:07.884 --> 16:11.596
I'm here to talk to you about Newmerica.

16:11.679 --> 16:14.432
-Are you selling something?
-What? No.

16:14.515 --> 16:17.393
-Some kinda religion thing?
-Have we just met?

16:17.477 --> 16:20.855
No. I'm not selling insurance,
and I'm not thumping the good book.

16:20.938 --> 16:22.273
Newmerica is a place.

16:22.356 --> 16:26.527
It's a safe zone in Northern Canada
where it's too cold for the Zs.

16:26.611 --> 16:30.156
-Red and I have it pretty good here.
-Well, I see that. But for how long?

16:31.157 --> 16:34.911
I mean, you saw those Zs after me.
Something has got them on the war path.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.997
There's been so many rumors
and false hopes.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.500
-It's hard to believe anything.
-I know.

16:40.583 --> 16:43.920
But something about this feels right.

16:44.003 --> 16:47.006
-The US Government's involved.
-The government?

16:47.089 --> 16:49.133
I thought the last of the government
collapsed after the nukes.

16:49.217 --> 16:51.177
Well, apparently there's a few Feds left.

16:51.260 --> 16:52.970
There's some scattered platoons
of Marines,

16:53.054 --> 16:56.265
and they're trying to get everybody
to Newmerica before the new snowfall.

16:56.349 --> 16:57.975
How are we supposed to get
to Northern Canada?

16:58.059 --> 17:01.229
They set up a refugee camp
for the survivors that want to go.

17:01.312 --> 17:03.689
A convoy of trucks is gonna pick them up.

17:03.773 --> 17:05.274
I dunno. This is a good spot.

17:05.358 --> 17:09.487
It's defensible. Fresh water. Fish.
Didn't see another human until you.

17:09.570 --> 17:12.990
-But there's been more Zs lately.
-I tell you, these Marines mean business.

17:13.074 --> 17:16.953
They set up this camp
with medical supplies and communication.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.872
A year from now, there's not gonna be
much in the way of humans left.

17:19.956 --> 17:21.874
You guys, I've--

17:21.958 --> 17:24.669
I just don't know if we're gonna get
another chance like this.

17:27.838 --> 17:30.132
[sighs] You got any scissors?

17:32.218 --> 17:34.053
Daddy! Daddy!

17:46.274 --> 17:48.609
-I only got one bullet left.
-Save it!

17:48.693 --> 17:50.069
I got a clear shot.

17:54.657 --> 17:55.825
There's someone coming!

18:18.931 --> 18:21.100
-Back off or I'll shoot!
-We're here to help.

18:24.312 --> 18:26.480
-Tell her to get back.
-Wait! Let her help.

18:32.445 --> 18:33.571
Hang on. We'll get you out.

18:38.451 --> 18:39.910
-Take her.
-Thank you.

18:56.010 --> 18:58.638
Thank you. We're going to Newmerica.

18:58.721 --> 19:00.556
Marines are up the road.
You still got time.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.480
Why did you do that?

19:10.733 --> 19:12.151
That was our mom.

19:12.234 --> 19:15.946
Have mercy. Have mercy.

19:25.373 --> 19:28.709
Are you sure you want to go
to this Newmerica place?

19:28.793 --> 19:30.503
I don't think we have much of a choice.

19:32.713 --> 19:34.340
-Zona.
-Time to jet.

19:40.554 --> 19:41.597
[snarls softly]

20:01.909 --> 20:04.370
[female voice]
<i>Arrived. Shall I wait at the curb?</i>

20:04.453 --> 20:06.372
Uh, no. Go park somewhere.

20:06.455 --> 20:08.708
<i>Enjoy your evening, Murph.</i>

20:08.791 --> 20:11.877
<i>You, too, General Warren.
You look stunning.</i>

20:11.961 --> 20:13.963
Did your car just hit on me?

20:14.046 --> 20:15.881
[chuckles]
The Founder's gonna love you.

20:15.965 --> 20:19.760
He's actually really cool for a guy
everyone calls The Founder.

20:19.844 --> 20:24.014
-But don't let his appearance spook you.
-His appearance?

20:24.098 --> 20:26.976
Let's just say he's been through a lot.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.937
You know, he developed
the original vaccine using his own blood.

20:30.020 --> 20:33.649
Unfortunately, it... failed.
[clears throat]

20:33.733 --> 20:36.861
Not everyone has the corpuscles
it takes to be The Murphy.

20:36.944 --> 20:40.614
You know what I'm saying?
Evening, Khan. The boss in?

20:43.868 --> 20:46.829
-Murph.
-[chuckles] Founder.

20:46.912 --> 20:49.290
-Thank you so much for having us.
-[breathes deeply]

20:49.373 --> 20:52.585
Murph. Murph, is-- is that you?

20:52.668 --> 20:56.297
Wow. You look great.

20:56.380 --> 20:59.592
-Thanks to you.
-[laughs] You're too kind.

20:59.675 --> 21:02.678
Founder, I would like you to meet
a very special friend of mine.

21:02.762 --> 21:05.139
This is Roberta Warren.

21:05.222 --> 21:09.810
Everyone on Zona knows
who General Warren is.

21:09.894 --> 21:13.606
I had forgotten how--
how beautiful she was.

21:18.861 --> 21:20.446
-General.
-Roberta, please.

21:21.781 --> 21:24.033
It's a pleasure.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.409
We've met before.

21:27.077 --> 21:28.704
We have?

21:28.788 --> 21:31.874
All of us here on Zona owe you...

21:31.957 --> 21:36.128
our undying gratitude...

21:36.212 --> 21:40.716
for delivering The Murphy to us alive.

21:40.800 --> 21:44.637
It wasn't easy, considering half the time
I wanted to kill him myself.

21:46.597 --> 21:49.767
[laughs]

21:53.312 --> 21:56.816
[sighs] Oh, and she's funny, too.

21:56.899 --> 21:58.984
[both chuckle]

22:01.237 --> 22:03.113
We'll want you in the gene pool.

22:04.615 --> 22:07.409
I have some friends
I would like for you to meet.

22:15.376 --> 22:18.087
I would like you all to meet
our hero's hero

22:18.170 --> 22:21.423
and my new best friend...

22:21.507 --> 22:22.842
General Roberta Warren.

23:06.552 --> 23:09.263
How long do you expect us
to stay in this hellhole?

23:09.346 --> 23:11.557
The convoy should be here in a few hours.

23:11.640 --> 23:14.602
-That's what you said yesterday.
-We all hate this.

23:14.685 --> 23:17.688
But that's the best information I have.
If that's not enough, ask the soldiers.

23:17.771 --> 23:20.274
They're in contact with the convoy.

23:20.357 --> 23:22.818
Find any empty tent.
Latrines are over there.

23:22.901 --> 23:26.071
Stay inside the perimeters at all times,
especially after dark.

23:26.155 --> 23:29.575
[woman] We have been out here
in the open for a week like zombie bait.

23:29.658 --> 23:31.452
I left everything to get here.

23:31.535 --> 23:34.955
There's no reason to raise your voice.
You have my attention.

23:35.039 --> 23:36.957
No reason to raise my voice?

23:37.041 --> 23:41.795
I promise you, the Marines
take your safety very seriously.

23:41.879 --> 23:43.547
I think somebody needs a hug.

23:45.716 --> 23:47.676
-How long has it been?
-Since what?

23:47.801 --> 23:50.471
Since you had a hug.

23:50.554 --> 23:51.805
-Come on.
-I...

23:51.889 --> 23:53.140
-Come here.
-Hey...

23:53.223 --> 23:56.143
-Come here.
-Hey. Hey! He--

23:56.268 --> 23:59.188
Shh...

24:08.947 --> 24:11.116
Human contact is very important.

24:19.375 --> 24:22.753
I feel better already. How 'bout you?

24:22.836 --> 24:24.463
Try it again and I'll shoot you.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.174
Fair enough.

24:31.345 --> 24:35.015
Yo, Doc! Doctor Mei Mei!

24:35.099 --> 24:38.435
-Doc!
-I made it! [laughs]

24:38.519 --> 24:39.937
And look who I found.

24:40.020 --> 24:42.231
-Sun Mei! [laughs]
-Red.

24:43.315 --> 24:45.526
10K.

24:45.609 --> 24:47.903
-Yeah, we all made it.
-What happened to you?

24:47.986 --> 24:49.488
Oh. [chuckles]

24:49.571 --> 24:52.199
10K thought I was some kinda
Gandalf Zombie,

24:52.282 --> 24:53.659
and he coldcocked me.

24:53.742 --> 24:55.869
-Gandalf?
<i>-Lord of the Rings. </i>Gandalf.

24:57.496 --> 25:01.417
-You know, long hair, pointy beard?
-History was never my best subject.

25:01.583 --> 25:04.044
Yeah, I know, kid.
That's what gives me hope for the future.

25:04.128 --> 25:07.047
Chance to start over from scratch.

25:07.131 --> 25:09.675
Cricket? What? It's protein.

25:09.758 --> 25:13.429
[laughs] But talk about badassery.

25:13.512 --> 25:14.972
This girl here.

25:15.055 --> 25:17.808
No one more badass
than Generalisimo Warren here.

25:17.975 --> 25:20.644
I swear, I would've been dead
20 times over

25:20.728 --> 25:23.689
if it wasn't for her cutthroat
killer instincts.

25:23.772 --> 25:26.734
This one time,
she actually chopped off the head

25:26.817 --> 25:29.987
-of a mutual friend of ours--
-He was already dead.

25:30.070 --> 25:32.114
Well, comme ci, comme ca.
[chuckles]

25:32.197 --> 25:33.365
We hardly knew each other.

25:33.449 --> 25:37.494
So much death.
But I haven't even seen a Z in years.

25:37.578 --> 25:39.204
You must've killed a lot of zombies.

25:39.288 --> 25:41.915
My friend here, he exaggerates.

25:41.999 --> 25:44.585
Hmm! A ton. [chuckles]

25:44.668 --> 25:47.546
Violence... it's a virtue.

25:47.629 --> 25:50.632
There's no need
to be humble here, Roberta.

25:50.716 --> 25:53.218
You are among friends.

25:53.302 --> 25:55.512
I can see that.

25:55.596 --> 25:57.306
So, now that you're cured,

25:57.389 --> 26:00.100
you're gonna need to learn
how to fight zombies yourself.

26:00.184 --> 26:03.979
[laughs] Not me, sister. Mnh-mnh.

26:04.062 --> 26:07.608
Zona is zombie-free.
So this is where I'm retiring.

26:07.691 --> 26:09.818
My traveling days are over.

26:09.902 --> 26:12.279
Well, how many citizens
do you have here in Zona?

26:12.362 --> 26:16.992
Fewer than 10,000,
and if my reports are correct,

26:17.075 --> 26:21.663
we are the last of civilization...
in the Americas.

26:21.747 --> 26:23.499
Ten thousand.

26:23.582 --> 26:27.419
That's not many out of, what, 900 million?

26:27.503 --> 26:29.213
[Murphy chuckles]

26:29.296 --> 26:30.839
We've been here before.

26:30.923 --> 26:35.302
Fifty thousand years ago,
Homo Sapiens were almost extinct

26:35.385 --> 26:39.431
down to a sickly population
of fewer than 10,000.

26:39.515 --> 26:44.436
But we clawed our way back.
And we will do it again.

26:44.520 --> 26:46.063
-Hear, hear.
-Hear, hear.

26:49.650 --> 26:50.984
[bell rings]

26:53.987 --> 26:55.906
[wheezing into respirator]

27:01.203 --> 27:03.831
It is time, my friends.

27:03.914 --> 27:05.707
Time for renewal.

27:05.791 --> 27:08.001
Time for action.

27:08.085 --> 27:13.131
Creative destruction
to make way for the New World.

27:13.215 --> 27:16.969
It is the end of the world as we know it.

27:17.052 --> 27:19.805
And I feel fine.

27:19.888 --> 27:21.598
[laughs] Hear, hear.

27:21.682 --> 27:23.267
[thumping on table]

27:24.476 --> 27:25.853
As I speak,

27:25.936 --> 27:31.692
the last of the un-vaxed Homo Sapiens
are self-destructing.

27:31.900 --> 27:37.865
We cannot wait another decade
for the last zombie to die of starvation.

27:37.948 --> 27:40.659
We must hurry history along.

27:40.742 --> 27:42.953
The moment is here.

27:43.996 --> 27:49.501
The window of opportunity
to save humanity is rapidly closing!

27:49.585 --> 27:51.378
-Hear, hear.
-Hear, hear.

27:52.087 --> 27:56.633
Now, with the shield of the vaccine...

27:57.843 --> 28:01.763
and the sword of our wisdom...

28:01.847 --> 28:04.474
it is time...

28:04.558 --> 28:06.226
for The Reset.

28:07.561 --> 28:11.273
To The Reset!

28:11.356 --> 28:12.733
-To The Reset!
-To The Reset!

28:14.359 --> 28:15.485
[Murphy laughs]

28:37.591 --> 28:38.842
Careful!

28:42.262 --> 28:44.056
Tell that to the Zs!

28:45.724 --> 28:47.267
Are they still back there?

28:47.351 --> 28:49.728
They're getting closer!

28:49.811 --> 28:51.271
Zona's still after your blood!

29:12.834 --> 29:14.127
Look out!

29:26.598 --> 29:27.766
[laughs]

29:28.767 --> 29:31.144
That's not funny!
Zombies could've been hurt!

29:31.228 --> 29:32.479
Sorry.

29:51.164 --> 29:53.792
Mother.

29:54.084 --> 29:56.753
[Murphy] The manager asks the guy,
"So, what do you call yourselves?"

29:56.837 --> 30:01.383
And so the guys says,
"We call ourselves The Aristocrats!"

30:01.466 --> 30:02.801
[laughter]

30:07.597 --> 30:09.057
-[Murphy speaking softly]
-You look fabulous.

30:09.141 --> 30:11.685
Thank you. You as well.

30:11.768 --> 30:13.437
So, who did your hair?

30:13.520 --> 30:16.857
It... kinda did itself.

30:17.983 --> 30:20.986
-Do you play squash?
-I haven't in a while.

30:21.069 --> 30:23.822
Well, we'll have to get you
back on the court.

30:23.905 --> 30:26.366
It's like riding a bike.

30:26.450 --> 30:30.245
Besides, you want to stay in shape
for that special man.

30:31.663 --> 30:32.789
[softly] We're fine.

30:34.624 --> 30:40.339
I understand your two favorite things
are chocolate and killing zombies.

30:41.465 --> 30:45.427
So, I had my pastry chef bake

30:45.510 --> 30:47.804
a special dessert in your honor.

30:53.268 --> 30:57.314
It is a chocolate volcano
Zombie head cake.

30:57.397 --> 30:59.858
[laughter]

31:01.985 --> 31:03.028
It was my idea.

31:03.278 --> 31:05.447
Cut into it.
The brains are cherry custard.

31:09.201 --> 31:13.789
Please do us the honor
of cutting the cake.

31:25.467 --> 31:26.968
[bellowing]

31:27.052 --> 31:29.054
<i>Warren! Warren! Warren!</i>

31:46.530 --> 31:47.614
Warren...

31:54.246 --> 31:56.706
[laughs]

31:56.790 --> 31:58.792
That is a truly good story, man.

31:59.543 --> 32:02.254
Nice to see them laughing.

32:02.337 --> 32:04.631
They've been through a lot together.

32:04.714 --> 32:06.133
We all have.

32:08.093 --> 32:10.262
Doc tells me you and 10K
live in a tree house.

32:10.345 --> 32:12.597
A tree tent, actually.

32:12.681 --> 32:15.183
It was Tommy's-- I mean, 10K's idea.

32:15.892 --> 32:19.604
We had it all fixed up.
Very defensible.

32:19.688 --> 32:21.106
I hated to give it up.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.402
It's hard to let go
of any shred of security.

32:25.485 --> 32:28.530
Do you think this is real? Newmerica?

32:29.865 --> 32:33.076
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

32:34.953 --> 32:36.788
But maybe I just need
something to believe in.

32:39.666 --> 32:41.293
I think that's why everyone's here.

32:45.589 --> 32:49.259
You know, I was afraid to ask
the last time I saw you.

32:49.342 --> 32:53.346
What happened to the kid, 5K?
I never heard.

32:54.931 --> 32:56.975
You don't have to talk about it
if you don't want. I just--

32:57.058 --> 32:58.560
No, it's okay.

32:58.643 --> 33:00.979
When we finally made it
to the bottom of that mountain...

33:01.062 --> 33:04.149
<i>there was this huge flock of crows
swarming where he fell.</i>

33:04.733 --> 33:08.653
<i>I thought I saw him in the middle
of this cloud of birds, but...</i>

33:10.405 --> 33:13.909
he was gone.

33:13.992 --> 33:18.163
Still hope I'll see him again someday.
Crazy, huh?

33:20.081 --> 33:21.249
It helps.

33:28.131 --> 33:30.175
[Murphy] Well, you sure know
how to make a first impression.

33:30.258 --> 33:32.802
I'm sorry. Something's wrong.

33:32.886 --> 33:35.555
Yeah, well, two years in a coma
with no one to talk to but yourself,

33:35.639 --> 33:38.558
-that's what's wrong.
-It's more than that.

33:39.851 --> 33:43.104
I can't stay here.
I have to get out of here.

33:43.188 --> 33:45.482
-And go where?
-I don't know. I...

33:48.401 --> 33:51.238
-Uh...
-Are you okay?

33:54.032 --> 33:57.452
Something's wrong with me.
I can't stay here.

33:57.536 --> 34:00.705
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

34:00.789 --> 34:02.457
Warren!

34:30.860 --> 34:32.612
-How are you?
-Afternoon, General.

34:32.696 --> 34:35.115
-Tell Murph I said hi.
-I will.

34:49.421 --> 34:51.006
[female voice]
<i>Where would you like to go, General--</i>

35:09.399 --> 35:11.568
Excuse me, ma'am. Barcode?

35:12.611 --> 35:14.487
I have somewhere I need to be.

35:14.571 --> 35:16.239
Ma'am, I'm gonna have to ask you to stop.

35:16.323 --> 35:17.991
[groans]

36:37.946 --> 36:39.698
Hey, it's okay, buddy. I got this.

36:41.950 --> 36:44.744
-Where were you going?
-I just knew I had to get out of here.

36:44.828 --> 36:46.454
You know, you could've killed
those guards.

36:46.538 --> 36:50.333
I mean, what the hell were you thinking?
This is not the Apocalypse.

36:50.417 --> 36:52.711
You can't just go around killing things
like you used to.

36:52.794 --> 36:55.130
You're lucky they're just sending you
for a psychiatric evaluation

36:55.213 --> 36:58.049
and not tossing you to the zombies.

36:58.133 --> 36:59.676
You don't understand.

36:59.759 --> 37:01.761
Enlighten me, please.

37:04.013 --> 37:05.348
I don't understand.

37:05.432 --> 37:06.850
The mission is over, Warren.

37:06.933 --> 37:08.935
There is no one left to save
but ourselves.

37:09.018 --> 37:10.895
So don't go all PTSD on me

37:10.979 --> 37:13.732
and blow the first good thing
that's happened to us since Day One.

37:19.195 --> 37:21.030
[engine starts]

37:26.119 --> 37:29.164
Oh, I got some ammo for you,
courtesy of the US Government.

37:29.247 --> 37:32.125
The Lieutenant wants us to be ready
in case the shit goes down.

37:32.208 --> 37:34.878
I'm more worried about some of our fellow
refugees than I am about zombies.

37:34.961 --> 37:37.547
-Yeah, tell me about it.
-What if we get there, and it sucks?

37:37.630 --> 37:41.259
Life's a crapshoot, kid.
Just look at the bright side.

37:41.342 --> 37:43.595
You're a young man.
You've got your whole life ahead of you.

37:43.678 --> 37:45.555
Maybe you and Red
might even want to start a family.

37:45.638 --> 37:47.182
Yeah, I dunno about that.

37:47.265 --> 37:48.975
Trouble in paradise?

37:49.058 --> 37:52.604
What? No, nothing like that.

37:52.687 --> 37:56.441
No, she just doesn't want kids.
Not after what happened to 5K.

38:00.069 --> 38:02.989
Yeah, what did happen?
You never told me.

38:03.072 --> 38:05.575
Well, we went to go search for him
where he would've fallen

38:05.658 --> 38:09.579
<i>but there was this huge murder
of crows in a black cloud.</i>

38:09.662 --> 38:13.500
<i>Red thought that she saw him
standing among the crows.</i>

38:14.667 --> 38:16.252
<i>Then the flock cleared.</i>

38:18.213 --> 38:19.464
<i>And we saw him.</i>

38:26.930 --> 38:29.808
He sacrificed himself
to save Addy and Lucy.

38:32.185 --> 38:33.311
Damn.

38:35.021 --> 38:38.900
You know, for not being blood kin,
that kid was an awful lot like you.

38:38.983 --> 38:40.985
Is that supposed to make me feel better?

38:41.069 --> 38:42.529
No. Sorry.

38:44.239 --> 38:46.407
Three Zs. Two humans.

38:46.491 --> 38:48.576
Why bother? They're just humans.

38:49.744 --> 38:52.455
We got to work
on a new attitude for you, missy,

38:52.539 --> 38:54.666
before we get to Newmerica.

38:54.749 --> 38:58.044
I don't know why everyone's
in such a hurry to get to Newmerica.

38:58.127 --> 38:59.671
Just sounds cold to me.

39:08.847 --> 39:10.390
Addy, wait. Something's wrong.

39:12.141 --> 39:13.351
There's no zombies here.

39:15.728 --> 39:17.230
Lucy.

39:26.573 --> 39:28.741
Rolling Thunder One.
Rolling Thunder One.

39:30.493 --> 39:32.287
Rolling Thunder One, do you copy?

39:34.497 --> 39:35.623
Keep trying.

39:35.707 --> 39:37.709
Rolling Thunder One.
Rolling Thunder One.

39:37.792 --> 39:41.963
This is Rendezvous Papa Whiskey November.
Do you copy?

39:46.426 --> 39:48.970
Let her go! I'm the one you want.

39:50.805 --> 39:53.975
Hey! I'm talking to you.
I'm talking to you!

39:54.058 --> 39:56.019
You're the only one in here.
I'm talking to you!

39:56.811 --> 39:58.938
<i>-Leave them alone.
-Why should I?</i>

39:59.022 --> 40:01.941
<i>Save your energy.
We're gonna need it later.</i>

40:02.025 --> 40:03.067
[Lucy] <i>You're no fun.</i>

40:03.151 --> 40:05.612
[Addy] <i>Just keep your eyes on me
and be ready to move.</i>

40:05.695 --> 40:06.905
Yeah, yeah.

41:20.353 --> 41:22.647
[tires squeal, vehicle clunks]

41:25.316 --> 41:27.527
-[man] Hey!
-[faint scuffling]

41:28.194 --> 41:30.279
Warren. Warren, wake up.

41:30.363 --> 41:32.573
-We've stopped.
-[man grunts]

41:32.657 --> 41:33.783
Get me out of here.

41:40.164 --> 41:41.457
Doctor Teller?

41:42.291 --> 41:43.668
Come with me.

41:45.753 --> 41:46.963
There's no time to explain.
