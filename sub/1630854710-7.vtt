00:01.080 --> 00:05.440
In the world today, protecting
a country's borders is vital.

00:06.760 --> 00:08.920
It is seen as a
gateway to the UK.

00:08.960 --> 00:11.880
These are the men
and women in uniform

00:11.920 --> 00:15.640
responsible for safeguarding
Ireland's borders. Stopping...

00:15.680 --> 00:17.880
Look at me. Behind the
yellow line. ..Searching...

00:17.920 --> 00:19.576
Have you been stopped
at a checkpoint before?

00:19.600 --> 00:21.496
Will you just listen to me?
Will you just listen to me?

00:21.520 --> 00:25.200
..And seizing drugs,
arms and illegal goods.

00:25.240 --> 00:27.880
If anyone tries to harm me,
that dog will tear them to shreds.

00:27.920 --> 00:29.720
Saving lives...

00:29.760 --> 00:32.400
I'd say about 200km
per hour. ..And protecting

00:32.440 --> 00:36.040
Ireland's inhabitants and
millions of visiting tourists.

00:36.080 --> 00:38.056
You could have been here
100 times, it doesn't mean

00:38.080 --> 00:40.600
that you're guaranteed
to get in the 101st time.

00:40.640 --> 00:42.960
They police the ports...

00:43.000 --> 00:44.920
Well, you have to make sure

00:44.960 --> 00:46.416
there's definitely nobody
underneath the vehicle.

00:46.440 --> 00:48.440
..The airports...

00:48.480 --> 00:50.120
Why did you tell me
you weren't working?

00:50.160 --> 00:52.680
..And the roads.
These are very badly

00:52.720 --> 00:54.560
damaged straps. If
you can't drive the truck,

00:54.600 --> 00:56.240
shouldn't be on the road.

00:57.920 --> 01:01.280
These are the...

01:08.360 --> 01:12.160
Border forces keep a watchful eye
as families travel through the airport.

01:12.200 --> 01:15.600
Who are you travelling with,
Michael? Is that your dad, is it?

01:17.200 --> 01:20.800
Dublin port security have
their hands full across the site.

01:20.840 --> 01:23.320
How are you? Well,
what're you doing?

01:23.360 --> 01:24.880
It's illegal what you're doing.

01:24.920 --> 01:27.000
And driving on his mobile phone

01:27.040 --> 01:29.760
is only the start of
this driver's bad day.

01:29.800 --> 01:32.120
On a motorway with a
phone up to your face,

01:32.160 --> 01:33.760
not exactly safe.
Not while driving.

01:36.600 --> 01:39.840
As Europe's most westerly airport,
Shannon handles an increasing number

01:39.880 --> 01:42.760
of transatlantic flights.

01:42.800 --> 01:47.240
With increased arrivals from outside
Europe comes increased scrutiny

01:47.280 --> 01:51.280
of passengers by officers
on passport and immigration.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.520
Hello, there.
Officer dara Malloy

01:56.560 --> 01:59.200
checks that passports
and paperwork are in order,

01:59.240 --> 02:01.800
before allowing
anyone into Ireland.

02:01.840 --> 02:06.320
As well as keeping the border
secure, officer Malloy is also tasked

02:06.360 --> 02:09.360
with keeping passengers
safe, and that particularly

02:09.400 --> 02:11.880
includes children. Hello.

02:13.600 --> 02:16.960
It's estimated that 1.2 million
children around the world

02:17.000 --> 02:20.560
are illegally trafficked every
year. Trafficking does happen.

02:20.600 --> 02:23.520
It happens all over the
world, for different reasons.

02:23.560 --> 02:26.560
But, hopefully, we are
trying to prevent it here.

02:26.600 --> 02:28.200
But it does happen.

02:28.240 --> 02:30.520
Child trafficking does happen.

02:30.560 --> 02:35.160
Immigration staff are constantly
on the lookout for unusual activity.

02:35.200 --> 02:39.240
Signs of threat, coercion,
abduction, or abuse of power

02:39.280 --> 02:42.080
to transport people
across the borders.

02:43.920 --> 02:46.176
We would be able to draw from
our experience, to make sure

02:46.200 --> 02:47.936
the child is happy with the
person they're travelling with,

02:47.960 --> 02:49.416
whether it be a parent
or their guardian.

02:49.440 --> 02:50.496
And who you
travelling with today?

02:50.520 --> 02:53.480
Mum. Say, "yes, please."

02:53.520 --> 02:55.080
He's your own anyway?

02:55.120 --> 02:57.400
Yeah, he is, yeah.
Right. Thank you.

02:59.760 --> 03:01.280
Thanks ever so much.

03:01.320 --> 03:02.760
Bye-bye. Thank you. Bye-bye.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.480
With the correct ID, the
family are waved through.

03:05.520 --> 03:07.840
Hello, sir.

03:07.880 --> 03:09.400
Hi.

03:09.440 --> 03:11.480
Is that your dad, is it?

03:11.520 --> 03:13.720
That's my mum. Come over here.

03:16.920 --> 03:18.920
I'll just see a passport
here, just to make sure

03:18.960 --> 03:21.600
that he would match up.
It's just security to make sure

03:21.640 --> 03:23.800
that the kids are, you
know, with the parents.

03:23.840 --> 03:25.600
That's lovely. Thanks very much.

03:27.680 --> 03:31.600
Another family arrive at detective
garda Seamus McMahon's desk.

03:31.640 --> 03:33.880
But there's a problem.

03:33.920 --> 03:37.200
There's just two passports,
sir? It seems the family were led

03:37.240 --> 03:39.720
to believe they didn't need
passports for the children

03:39.760 --> 03:42.600
to travel to Ireland.
They do here, ma'am.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.400
It says they don't
if they're travelling

03:44.440 --> 03:46.840
with an adult and
they're under 16.

03:46.880 --> 03:48.840
Through Irish immigration?

03:48.880 --> 03:51.080
It just said flying
from britain to Ireland.

03:51.120 --> 03:53.160
It's on the aer lingus website.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.040
Officer McMahon,

03:55.080 --> 03:57.920
happy that the family is all
together, allows them through.

03:57.960 --> 04:00.680
We don't have a website,
ma'am, but I think it's a given

04:00.720 --> 04:03.016
that you produce your passport
in any country that you go to.

04:03.040 --> 04:06.000
It does say that. Thank you.
Thanks very much. Thank you.

04:07.760 --> 04:09.176
They were accompanied
by two children.

04:09.200 --> 04:12.440
She handed two passports in to
me but she never produced passports

04:12.480 --> 04:15.200
for the children. She seemed
to have an issue with that.

04:15.240 --> 04:17.120
You do need to
produce your passport.

04:17.160 --> 04:19.336
That was the only way I
could verify that they were all

04:19.360 --> 04:22.160
travelling together and they were
actually children of that couple.

04:22.200 --> 04:26.560
In his booth, officer Malloy is
confronted by an unaccompanied boy.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.056
And who are you
travelling with today?

04:28.080 --> 04:30.680
My dad. And where's your dad?

04:33.960 --> 04:35.560
Ok. Come here.

04:35.600 --> 04:37.560
Are you sure he's there, is he?

04:37.600 --> 04:39.176
Ok. Will you take a
seat over there for me

04:39.200 --> 04:40.680
for two seconds until he comes?

04:40.720 --> 04:42.240
Is that ok?

04:43.680 --> 04:45.280
No, that's lovely, thank you.

04:45.320 --> 04:48.120
While he checks other
arrivals, officer Malloy

04:48.160 --> 04:51.360
keeps a close eye on the boy...

04:51.400 --> 04:53.600
Can you see him?

04:53.640 --> 04:56.520
..Until his father finally
arrives at the desk.

04:56.560 --> 04:59.480
Oh, you're the dad, are you?

04:59.520 --> 05:01.440
He got ahead of you.
Just to make sure he was

05:01.480 --> 05:02.856
with an adult, do
you get me? Aye.

05:02.880 --> 05:04.960
Mind yourselves,
lads. Take care now.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.720
And officer Malloy
can safely let

05:07.760 --> 05:10.000
the boy carry on
with his journey.

05:14.760 --> 05:18.240
Running 24 hours a
day, 365 days of the year,

05:18.280 --> 05:22.040
activity around the 600-acre
site of Dublin port never stops.

05:24.720 --> 05:29.480
It means port security have
got their work cut out protecting it,

05:29.520 --> 05:32.160
keeping everything
moving, people safe

05:32.200 --> 05:36.160
and ensuring this vital border
entry point into Ireland is secure.

05:36.200 --> 05:38.960
You have a lot of traffic in
and out so what's happening,

05:39.000 --> 05:40.296
it's so busy, there's
people everywhere,

05:40.320 --> 05:41.376
there's traffic everywhere,

05:41.400 --> 05:44.560
there's movement
everywhere. It's a big job.

05:44.600 --> 05:46.800
Officer dermot
wheldon is on patrol

05:46.840 --> 05:50.880
checking for everything, from
stowaways to suspect vehicles.

05:53.240 --> 05:55.720
As well as ground patrols,
the port security team

05:55.760 --> 05:59.000
have a vast network
of cctv cameras.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.080
Back in the control room,

06:03.120 --> 06:07.000
dermot is on the lookout
for anything suspicious.

06:07.040 --> 06:09.480
Left-hand side. Camera 22.

06:09.520 --> 06:11.400
The officers have
to be ready to deal

06:11.440 --> 06:14.560
with any incident, night or day.

06:17.080 --> 06:20.720
A truck parked up overnight
in the port has caught fire.

06:20.760 --> 06:23.680
Following emergency
incident protocols,

06:23.720 --> 06:27.080
the team raise the alarm
and secure the area.

06:27.120 --> 06:30.520
It allows the fire service to
quickly get the Blaze under control,

06:30.560 --> 06:33.000
limiting its spread and
potentially saving lives,

06:33.040 --> 06:36.440
and avoiding thousands
of pounds worth of damage.

06:38.440 --> 06:41.720
The size of Dublin port also
makes it a tempting location

06:41.760 --> 06:45.440
for criminals intent
on illegal activity,

06:45.480 --> 06:49.120
with opportunists
looking for any advantage.

06:49.160 --> 06:51.680
But their appearance
on the port's cctv

06:51.720 --> 06:54.760
means they won't be
getting away with it.

06:54.800 --> 06:57.520
Used in conjunction with the
security teams on the ground,

06:57.560 --> 06:59.720
the cctv puts the criminals

06:59.760 --> 07:01.920
on the back foot,
from illegal immigrants

07:01.960 --> 07:07.040
trying to break into the country,
tracking stolen or wanted vehicles,

07:07.080 --> 07:09.480
or simply in hot pursuit.

07:09.520 --> 07:11.600
(Phone rings)

07:11.640 --> 07:13.200
Hello?

07:13.240 --> 07:14.656
Port operations.
How may I help you?

07:14.680 --> 07:16.720
Back in the control room,

07:16.760 --> 07:20.640
security officer wheldon has
spotted something suspicious.

07:20.680 --> 07:23.680
He's concerned about
an illegally parked lorry.

07:25.160 --> 07:28.480
On the ground, security officer
paddy Rooney is sent to investigate.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.440
Control to Alpha three.

07:31.480 --> 07:34.120
I now locked that gate,
paddy, that you rang me for.

07:34.160 --> 07:36.800
A stationary truck on site
could be entirely innocent,

07:36.840 --> 07:40.160
but it could also be a sign
that something is wrong.

07:40.200 --> 07:42.720
I'm just going to wake this
fella up, ok? So I'll be doing it.

07:42.760 --> 07:45.600
Put the camera on, ok?
This driver is about to get

07:45.640 --> 07:48.200
a wakeup call,
port security style.

07:53.800 --> 07:56.520
Good morning. Morning.
How are you this morning?

07:57.600 --> 07:59.680
Oh... tired. Tired?

07:59.720 --> 08:02.320
Quizzing the driver,
paddy explains

08:02.360 --> 08:06.240
that he's parked his truck in
a no-parking area of the port.

08:06.280 --> 08:08.440
It is a restricted
area down here.

08:08.480 --> 08:11.080
And like I said, it is
backing onto the road.

08:11.120 --> 08:13.160
We could have easily
put a clamp on you,

08:13.200 --> 08:14.960
wait till you got up
and charged 80 Euros.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.840
But, unfortunately, I'm in
good humour here today

08:17.880 --> 08:19.200
'cause I'm going on holidays.

08:19.240 --> 08:20.440
Are you long here?

08:20.480 --> 08:22.200
2:00.

08:22.240 --> 08:25.880
Drivers are required by law
to take proper rest breaks

08:25.920 --> 08:28.360
before they can
start driving again.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.360
So, how many hours
rest do you want?

08:32.720 --> 08:33.976
Right, I'm gonna
give you an extra hour

08:34.000 --> 08:35.416
and then you're to
get yourself sorted

08:35.440 --> 08:37.840
and out of here.
So, at 11:15. Ok?

08:37.880 --> 08:41.000
So I'm gonna give you about an
hour or so, ok? Yeah, very good, ok.

08:41.040 --> 08:43.040
Have a good day, ok. Thank you.

08:43.080 --> 08:45.000
Understanding of the situation,

08:45.040 --> 08:47.560
officer Rooney gives him
time to get himself sorted.

08:47.600 --> 08:50.800
We don't mind him actually
parking around the areas.

08:50.840 --> 08:54.880
But we normally would like to
see them out of here by lunchtime.

08:54.920 --> 08:59.000
So his tachograph is up at
another half an hour or whatever.

08:59.040 --> 09:01.920
And, so I gave him a full
hour to get himself dressed.

09:03.480 --> 09:07.040
Elsewhere in the port, security
have received reports of horses

09:07.080 --> 09:09.800
grazing on the side of the road.

09:13.160 --> 09:15.680
While the control room
monitors the situation,

09:15.720 --> 09:18.320
security officer Rooney
heads to investigate.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.320
Oh, we have two of
them. Good man, indeed.

09:22.360 --> 09:24.000
Excellent.

09:27.760 --> 09:29.720
How are you?

09:29.760 --> 09:32.240
Well, what're you doing?
It's illegal what you're doing.

09:32.280 --> 09:35.640
The horses pose a
security risk to passengers

09:35.680 --> 09:39.280
and the many vehicles
that use the port daily.

09:39.320 --> 09:42.880
And they're trespassing
on private property.

09:42.920 --> 09:45.840
It's officer Rooney's job to move
the two men and their horses on

09:45.880 --> 09:48.160
as quickly as possible.

09:48.200 --> 09:52.360
You can start putting the horses
back in the box. He's here now.

09:54.640 --> 09:56.560
Ok. Thank you. With
the horses sent packing,

09:56.600 --> 09:59.640
it's now just a matter
of officer Rooney

09:59.680 --> 10:01.240
checking where he
makes his next step.

10:05.400 --> 10:07.800
It's estimated that 30,000
people cross the border

10:07.840 --> 10:10.920
between the republic of Ireland
and northern Ireland every day.

10:12.520 --> 10:14.920
Policing the m1 motorway,

10:14.960 --> 10:16.736
one of the busiest routes
between the two countries,

10:16.760 --> 10:19.480
are traffic corps officers
paddy mcelroy and Phil earle.

10:21.040 --> 10:22.800
Driving an unmarked car,

10:22.840 --> 10:25.680
they're watching for
suspicious and illegal activity.

10:25.720 --> 10:28.320
We're on the motorway
here, we're 120km zone.

10:28.360 --> 10:32.240
He's got the phone
up to his face.

10:32.280 --> 10:33.976
Flashing their lights
and pulling him over...

10:34.000 --> 10:37.760
Get the yellow jackets on.
..Officer mcelroy is about to ruin

10:37.800 --> 10:39.760
this driver's day.

10:41.360 --> 10:44.320
On a motorway with a phone
up to your face, not exactly safe.

10:44.360 --> 10:46.480
Not while driving.

10:46.520 --> 10:50.520
The guy's already looking at
an automatic fixed penalty fine.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.360
See your driver's licence.

10:54.400 --> 10:57.480
Officer mcelroy
wants to see some ID.

10:59.360 --> 11:03.120
The officers' car is also
fitted with an anpr scanner,

11:03.160 --> 11:08.120
allowing them to immediately
perform background checks on vehicles.

11:08.160 --> 11:10.480
No ID on him whatsoever.

11:10.520 --> 11:13.200
The anpr has pinged
through a result.

11:13.240 --> 11:16.440
And officer earle has some
further bad news for the driver.

11:16.480 --> 11:19.520
Insurance is out, tax is out.

11:19.560 --> 11:23.920
With no insurance or tax,
the vehicle will now get seized.

11:23.960 --> 11:26.376
We're requesting a tow truck to
come to the scene. This vehicle's

11:26.400 --> 11:28.720
gonna be seized under
section 41 of the road traffic act.

11:28.760 --> 11:31.240
The driver of which, he has
no documentation with him.

11:31.280 --> 11:35.200
It appears that, I think,
he's refusing to give details.

11:35.240 --> 11:38.360
Officer mcelroy isn't done,
though, with this driver.

11:38.400 --> 11:41.040
Suspicious that he won't give
them anything other than a name,

11:41.080 --> 11:43.120
the officers call it in.

11:43.160 --> 11:46.280
Control, can we get a person
check when you have a chance?

11:46.320 --> 11:49.240
For the moment, this
driver is going nowhere.

11:50.800 --> 11:54.160
And things could be
about to get a lot worse.

11:58.200 --> 12:00.800
More than 20,000
foreign students

12:00.840 --> 12:03.160
travel to Ireland
to study every year,

12:03.200 --> 12:06.440
many of them arriving at the
country's largest airport in Dublin.

12:08.040 --> 12:11.320
With student visas being
one way illegal immigrants

12:11.360 --> 12:14.960
enter a country before disappearing,
passport and immigration officers

12:15.000 --> 12:19.320
need to make sure students are
coming into Ireland for the right reasons.

12:20.960 --> 12:23.200
In order to prove
they're in Ireland to study,

12:23.240 --> 12:26.320
students are required to
have a letter of invitation

12:26.360 --> 12:28.960
from the college or university
they're going to be studying at.

12:31.400 --> 12:34.040
A flight from the
us has just landed

12:34.080 --> 12:37.240
and a male student has arrived
at officer Mick lhalley's booth.

12:40.080 --> 12:42.800
Before officer lhalley lets
the student into Ireland,

12:42.840 --> 12:45.360
he'll need to see the
relevant ID and paperwork.

12:45.400 --> 12:49.880
But there's a problem.
Did they not explain to you

12:49.920 --> 12:52.600
that you require a letter
of introduction here, no?

12:53.360 --> 12:56.000
Do you have any documentation
from the school at all, no?

12:56.040 --> 12:58.800
There are emails
of letters saying...

12:58.840 --> 13:00.680
Do you have
anything printed out?

13:00.720 --> 13:03.560
I don't have them with me
now. With no printed documents,

13:03.600 --> 13:06.400
there's no way of
officer lhalley confirming

13:06.440 --> 13:10.000
the student's story, which
means he's going nowhere.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.680
The young man desperately
tries to find email confirmation

13:15.720 --> 13:16.920
from the college.

13:16.960 --> 13:21.040
The only problem is that he
can't get a phone connection.

13:24.640 --> 13:28.200
And why are you here?
Through the school.

13:28.240 --> 13:30.400
A may-mester.

13:32.040 --> 13:34.040
In another booth,
officer ray flannery

13:34.080 --> 13:37.360
is also having issues with
a newly arrived student.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.120
You have a letter
from the college?

13:39.160 --> 13:41.440
I do not. You should have.

13:41.480 --> 13:43.800
'Cause I have no proof
as to why you're here.

13:43.840 --> 13:46.120
A lack of the correct
paperwork means this student

13:46.160 --> 13:48.240
is also going nowhere.

13:48.280 --> 13:51.000
Should I get a professor? Yeah.

13:51.040 --> 13:54.360
She calls over her teacher to
see if there's anything they can do.

13:54.400 --> 13:57.480
Generally, a student group
will have a letter from the college

13:57.520 --> 14:00.480
they're coming to,
explaining why they're here,

14:00.520 --> 14:01.960
length of time, etcetera.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.840
The course they're
going to study.

14:03.880 --> 14:05.680
And they'll have a
list of the students.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.336
Do you have any
documents from the school,

14:07.360 --> 14:09.360
which you're coming to study?

14:09.400 --> 14:11.720
Student with no documentation.

14:11.760 --> 14:14.840
I have no proof. They
could be here for any reason.

14:14.880 --> 14:18.040
Ok. It's organised through
Franklin Pierce and ucd.

14:18.080 --> 14:20.680
Alright. Talk to
somebody in ucd.

14:20.720 --> 14:23.056
You should have a letter from
ucd saying that you're coming here

14:23.080 --> 14:28.000
to study for a period of, and
the amount of students. Ok.

14:28.040 --> 14:31.360
Back at officer lhalley's booth
and mobile phone connection,

14:31.400 --> 14:34.240
or lack of it, is still
causing a hold-up.

14:34.280 --> 14:36.080
And what course
are you doing here?

14:36.120 --> 14:38.240
What's that? What
will you be studying?

14:38.280 --> 14:42.360
I'll be studying physics. Can
you not use the Wi-Fi, no?

14:42.400 --> 14:46.040
It's saying 3g so you've
not found a Wi-Fi at all?

14:46.080 --> 14:47.720
And you're a physics
student? Yeah.

14:47.760 --> 14:50.560
Open up which
letter I need there.

14:50.600 --> 14:54.800
Eventually, the man finds the
email and shows it to officer lhalley.

14:54.840 --> 14:56.320
And the last sentence is,

14:56.360 --> 14:59.480
"you're recommended to retain
a copy of this letter with you..."

14:59.520 --> 15:03.720
Excellent. "For
immigration purposes."

15:03.760 --> 15:06.280
Having given the
student a mild ticking-off

15:06.320 --> 15:09.040
and a reminder to next
time read the travel details,

15:09.080 --> 15:11.720
officer lhalley stamps
the student's passport

15:11.760 --> 15:13.080
and lets him through.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.616
He's a physics student.
You would think he would be

15:14.640 --> 15:17.096
up to date with technology but,
you could clearly see from the top

15:17.120 --> 15:20.440
of the phone, he hadn't
got the Wi-Fi insignia on it.

15:20.480 --> 15:22.400
So, yeah, we got it
sorted in the end, anyway,

15:22.440 --> 15:23.720
between the two of us.

15:26.840 --> 15:28.320
At officer flannery's booth,

15:28.360 --> 15:31.000
having explained how
things are supposed to work,

15:31.040 --> 15:33.640
the officer uses his discretion

15:33.680 --> 15:36.520
and allows the
student to enter Ireland.

15:36.560 --> 15:39.920
You part of the study
group? I am, yes.

15:39.960 --> 15:44.760
And we explained to them procedures
going forward, what they need to do

15:44.800 --> 15:48.320
and they will talk to the relevant
colleges, and hopefully next time,

15:48.360 --> 15:50.280
it will be sorted.

15:50.320 --> 15:53.240
Patrolling the busy m1 motorway
that connects southern Ireland

15:53.280 --> 15:56.280
with northern Ireland,
traffic officers paddy mcelroy

15:56.320 --> 15:58.280
and Phil earle have
pulled over a driver

15:58.320 --> 16:00.920
for being on his mobile phone.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.960
Insurance is out, tax is out.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.200
And, having found
out the vehicle

16:05.240 --> 16:08.320
isn't taxed or insured,
they've seized it.

16:08.360 --> 16:10.600
I need to see some
driver's licence.

16:10.640 --> 16:14.600
But unable to verify his identify,
the white Van man has to wait,

16:14.640 --> 16:16.640
as the officers call
in for a check on him.

16:16.680 --> 16:19.440
Control, can we get a person
check when you have a chance?

16:22.000 --> 16:23.680
Roger that.

16:23.720 --> 16:25.376
Just a third address
we have on the system

16:25.400 --> 16:28.000
from an alias that he uses.

16:29.240 --> 16:32.160
Doesn't seem to be getting
convicted much but he's been coming

16:32.200 --> 16:34.600
to the attention of
garda quite a bit.

16:34.640 --> 16:37.760
With the name appearance to be
an alias, and the man suspected

16:37.800 --> 16:41.640
of possible criminal activity, it
looks like he's going nowhere.

16:43.960 --> 16:46.160
I think I'll bring him
back to verify who he is.

16:47.720 --> 16:50.440
The simple act of using his
mobile phone while driving

16:50.480 --> 16:53.080
has just landed this
driver in bigger trouble.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.160
You're being arrested
under section 107

16:57.200 --> 16:59.136
of the road traffic act. What
that means is, I'm not happy

16:59.160 --> 17:01.120
with your identification
or where you're living.

17:01.160 --> 17:03.680
So we're gonna bring you
back to a local garda station

17:03.720 --> 17:05.560
and we're gonna
verify who you are

17:05.600 --> 17:07.720
and that there's no
outstanding issues or warrants.

17:18.040 --> 17:21.520
With his true
identify still in doubt,

17:21.560 --> 17:25.320
it's not just his
vehicle getting seized.

17:25.360 --> 17:27.040
He's nicked, too.

17:28.600 --> 17:31.840
And it's a chauffeur-driven
ride to the police station.

17:39.360 --> 17:41.560
Further north on
the m1 motorway,

17:41.600 --> 17:44.880
just south of the border with
northern Ireland in county louth,

17:44.920 --> 17:47.800
a checkpoint has been set up
for the road safety association.

17:47.840 --> 17:51.600
He'll take one anyway.
Yeah, sound. Thanks.

17:52.560 --> 17:55.680
With its proximity to a border
crossing point that is used

17:55.720 --> 17:58.520
by thousands of
vehicles every day,

17:58.560 --> 18:02.600
it is the ideal spot for road
safety officer Jim Flemming

18:02.640 --> 18:06.240
to carry out spot checks
on haulage vehicles.

18:08.080 --> 18:10.160
Morning, sir. How are you doing?

18:10.200 --> 18:12.256
I'm from the road safety authority.
Jim Flemming is my name.

18:12.280 --> 18:14.176
I just need to have a look
at your recording equipment

18:14.200 --> 18:17.200
on your licence and documentation
for the vehicle, please.

18:17.240 --> 18:18.656
Would you mind moving
over and I'll hop in there

18:18.680 --> 18:21.400
and have a look at it. Haulage
vehicles operating anywhere

18:21.440 --> 18:24.960
in the eu need an operator's
licence to carry goods.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.360
Carrying out unlicensed road
transport operations can result

18:30.400 --> 18:36.080
in a fine of up to 500,000 Euros
and/or three years in prison.

18:36.120 --> 18:38.160
Do you have your
driving licence and a cbc?

18:38.200 --> 18:40.280
And have you got
the licence for the truck

18:40.320 --> 18:42.920
or the operator's licence?

18:42.960 --> 18:45.880
And do you have a copy of
the community authorisation?

18:45.920 --> 18:48.480
It's an a4 page, to be
engaged in the carriage

18:48.520 --> 18:50.840
of goods in the European Union?

18:50.880 --> 18:53.040
No.

18:53.080 --> 18:57.480
Jim has pulled over a truck that
is registered in northern Ireland.

18:58.840 --> 19:02.360
To transport goods across the
border, the operator needs a permit.

19:02.400 --> 19:05.840
And this driver
doesn't have one.

19:05.880 --> 19:07.856
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll just take a few details

19:07.880 --> 19:10.080
from you and it's a
matter for the company.

19:10.120 --> 19:12.840
It's an obligation of the
company to give it to you, so - ok?

19:12.880 --> 19:14.600
I understand. Yeah.

19:14.640 --> 19:17.200
The position at the moment,

19:17.240 --> 19:20.920
as far as I can make
out so far with this driver,

19:20.960 --> 19:23.240
is that he's an
out-of-state haulier

19:23.280 --> 19:27.320
so he's a northern
Ireland operator.

19:27.360 --> 19:29.776
To engage in the carriage of
goods within the European Union,

19:29.800 --> 19:32.600
outside his own jurisdiction,
they need to carry

19:32.640 --> 19:34.440
what's called a
community authorisation.

19:34.480 --> 19:36.680
It's essentially a licence
for international carriage

19:36.720 --> 19:38.040
and he doesn't have that.

19:38.080 --> 19:41.040
And more than likely, the company
will be summonsed for not having

19:41.080 --> 19:44.160
the correct
documentation onboard.

19:46.120 --> 19:47.536
In the meantime, I'll just
go and have a quick look

19:47.560 --> 19:50.040
at his driver card to
make sure that it's ok.

19:50.080 --> 19:53.040
It tells me he hasn't been
driving in quite a while

19:53.080 --> 19:56.000
so, from a driver's hours
perspective, he's fine.

19:56.040 --> 19:58.160
It's just to do with
the operator licensing.

19:58.200 --> 20:00.480
The question is the only
problem we have here.

20:00.520 --> 20:02.776
Jim reads the driver his
rights. I just have to caution you,

20:02.800 --> 20:04.296
you're not obliged to say
anything unless you wish to do so

20:04.320 --> 20:05.520
but whatever you do say

20:05.560 --> 20:07.016
may be taken down in
writing and given in evidence.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.480
Do you understand
that, yeah? Yeah, yeah.

20:09.520 --> 20:11.480
Luckily for him,
though, it's his employer,

20:11.520 --> 20:13.896
the operator of the vehicle,
who is responsible for ensuring

20:13.920 --> 20:16.840
the correct
paperwork is in place.

20:16.880 --> 20:19.520
They'll receive notice
of summons to court.

20:19.560 --> 20:22.000
Ok? Good man. Thank
you very much, indeed.

20:22.040 --> 20:23.880
Thank you. Cheers now.

20:23.920 --> 20:28.440
Not having the required permit
is not something Jim sees a lot of.

20:30.040 --> 20:34.760
I've encountered a couple,
probably quite some time ago.

20:34.800 --> 20:37.240
Any vehicle I would have
inspected in recent times,

20:37.280 --> 20:41.760
certainly this year, I
haven't come across any.

20:47.040 --> 20:49.016
As the truck pulls away, the
police stop another vehicle

20:49.040 --> 20:51.680
for Jim to check over.

20:51.720 --> 20:53.616
Mind if I have a look at
your tacho, please, if you...

20:53.640 --> 20:56.320
And do you have a copy of
the community authorisation

20:56.360 --> 20:58.040
for the carriage of goods?

20:58.080 --> 20:59.560
I do not.

21:02.120 --> 21:05.520
Amazingly, this vehicle is
in exactly the same situation,

21:05.560 --> 21:08.040
without the required
permit in the truck.

21:09.840 --> 21:12.400
Again, Jim reads
the driver his rights.

21:12.440 --> 21:14.056
You're not obliged to say
anything unless you wish to do so.

21:14.080 --> 21:16.496
Whatever you do say may be
taken in writing and given in evidence.

21:16.520 --> 21:19.040
And another truck
operator will be receiving

21:19.080 --> 21:21.360
a court summons
for the infringement.

21:21.400 --> 21:26.720
That's two in a row today
so... just a bad day, maybe.
