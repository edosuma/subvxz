Niall: Season 24 battles.

00:07.382 --> 00:08.550
I've got an amazing team,

00:08.591 --> 00:10.760
and I can't wait
to see them perform.

Okay, it's the first day
of battles.

00:15.557 --> 00:17.851
I'm ready to go.
Team Legend is ready.

00:17.892 --> 00:19.853
We're gonna sound great,
look great, feel great.

00:19.894 --> 00:21.354
It's a great day.

00:21.396 --> 00:23.523
Do I look a little eager?
I'm the only coach out here.

00:23.565 --> 00:25.275
This is my first battle round.

00:25.316 --> 00:27.027
It's very exciting to me.

00:27.068 --> 00:29.029
I'm a third-generation
rodeo brat,

00:29.070 --> 00:30.405
and I love to win.

00:30.447 --> 00:32.365
Is Niall gonna mess up
our color coordination?

00:32.407 --> 00:33.700
I bet he is.
Yeah, let's see
what he's wearing.

00:33.742 --> 00:36.327
Hey!
Oh, and he didn't
wear black.

00:36.369 --> 00:37.495
He's here for Blake,
basically.

00:37.537 --> 00:38.747
Blake -- Blake's son.
How are ya?

00:38.788 --> 00:40.040
He's got the denim on.
So good to see ya.

00:40.081 --> 00:41.291
John: I love the battles.

00:41.332 --> 00:43.918
We see our artists
grow and blossom.

00:43.960 --> 00:45.378
Team Legend is stacked.

00:45.420 --> 00:48.381
It's gonna be a tough battle
for all of us.

00:48.423 --> 00:50.216
Daly: Give it up
for our coaches --

00:50.258 --> 00:52.469
John Legend, Gwen Stefani,

00:52.510 --> 00:56.222
Niall Horan, and Reba McEntire!
Yes! Yes! Yes!

00:56.264 --> 00:58.725
Let's go!
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:58.767 --> 01:01.603
Come here, Reba.
Oh, thank you so much.

01:01.644 --> 01:03.104
First battle.

01:03.146 --> 01:05.315
I'm so excited.

01:05.357 --> 01:07.525
Niall: It's battle time.
This is gonna be so fun.

01:07.567 --> 01:09.486
The talent this year is crazy.

01:09.527 --> 01:11.946
* You don't have to say
what you did *

01:18.078 --> 01:21.081
* The heart won't lie *

01:21.122 --> 01:22.957
Daly: We've got a steal!

01:22.999 --> 01:24.709
We've got a second steal!

01:24.751 --> 01:26.294
Wow!

01:27.170 --> 01:28.963
Everybody ready?
Let's do it!

01:29.005 --> 01:32.425
[ Cheers and applause ]

01:32.467 --> 01:33.468
Whoo!

01:33.510 --> 01:35.387
Oh, I'm fired up.
John: Let's go.

01:35.428 --> 01:37.305
Daly:
Which passionate vocalist

01:37.347 --> 01:38.973
will win this
Team Legend battle?

01:39.015 --> 01:42.352
This opportunity to be here
at battles is everything to me.

01:42.394 --> 01:44.604
Deejay Young!

01:44.646 --> 01:48.108
Deejay: Being a standby
for "Hamilton" was very tough.

01:48.149 --> 01:49.526
Deejay!

01:49.567 --> 01:51.695
But this is an opportunity
to show my artistry,

01:51.736 --> 01:54.239
and I know that I have to
give it everything that I have.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.782
Ephraim: This is gonna be
a tough battle

01:55.824 --> 01:57.909
because we're both
incredible showmen.

01:57.951 --> 02:00.453
I'm not ready to go home.

02:00.495 --> 02:02.163
Daly: Ephraim Owens!

02:02.205 --> 02:03.456
[ Cheers and applause ]
Cool.

02:03.498 --> 02:04.791
And I want to show my kids

02:04.833 --> 02:07.168
that you don't give up
on dreams.

02:08.837 --> 02:10.171
Yes! Yes!

02:10.213 --> 02:12.465
Daddy's still got some
more work to do around here.

02:12.507 --> 02:15.301
Let's do this, brother.
Let's do this.

02:17.512 --> 02:19.139
Gentlemen.
How are you, Ephraim?

02:19.180 --> 02:20.932
Great to see you.
What's up, brother?
Good to see you.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.892
Deejay, how are you?
I'm great. I'm great.
I'm great.

02:22.934 --> 02:24.644
Welcome to the battles.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.479
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
I'm excited!

02:26.521 --> 02:29.399
John: I love being back
at the battles.

02:29.441 --> 02:30.900
There's something about
just me having

02:30.942 --> 02:33.069
this one-on-one conversation
with my artists,

02:33.111 --> 02:34.988
really imparting my knowledge.

02:35.030 --> 02:36.322
It's a lot of fun for me.

02:36.364 --> 02:38.491
We're gonna kill it.
We're gonna kill it.

02:38.533 --> 02:41.161
For this battle,
I paired Deejay and Ephraim.

02:41.202 --> 02:42.537
Both of them are great tenors.

02:42.579 --> 02:46.416
Both of them are soulful,
but only one can win.

02:46.458 --> 02:48.752
Ephraim, what did it feel like

02:48.793 --> 02:50.837
going through
the blind auditions?

02:50.879 --> 02:52.380
It was a whirlwind.

02:52.422 --> 02:57.510
* Would you let me see
beneath your beautiful? *

02:57.552 --> 02:59.512
Yes!
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go!

02:59.554 --> 03:02.015
It felt absolutely amazing
to get four chairs.

03:02.057 --> 03:04.559
John:
I loved that performance.

03:04.601 --> 03:06.978
You were singing it
like your life depended on it.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.397
My daughter sings
with me sometimes, too.

03:09.439 --> 03:10.648
Do you want
to bring her out?

03:10.690 --> 03:13.068
* But I still get... *

03:13.109 --> 03:14.319
Nervous.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.612
[ Laughter ]

03:15.653 --> 03:16.863
I'm dead.

03:16.905 --> 03:20.158
John Legend -- he's a person
I've looked up to

03:20.200 --> 03:22.369
as an artist, as a father.

03:22.410 --> 03:25.413
So, to be coached
by John Legend, it's amazing.

03:25.455 --> 03:26.748
My son is actually
my biggest fan.

03:26.790 --> 03:28.625
Like, he'll only listen
to me,

03:28.667 --> 03:31.503
but now my son is, like, making
me review my whole catalog.

03:31.544 --> 03:33.672
He listens to it
all the time.

03:33.713 --> 03:36.216
I got back to the hotel
and my wife told me

03:36.257 --> 03:37.509
that baby number three
is on the way.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.010
Oh! There you go.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.345
During this process,

03:40.387 --> 03:43.473
my wife gave me note cards
of encouragement.

03:43.515 --> 03:45.517
Then after my blind,
she says,

03:45.558 --> 03:47.811
"I have one more card
for you to open up,"

03:47.852 --> 03:50.522
and it tells me that we have
baby number three coming.

03:50.563 --> 03:54.651
Mommy told me that
we're having another baby.

03:54.693 --> 03:56.319
[ Squeals]
Oh!

03:56.361 --> 03:58.738
The goal is to pursue my dream,

03:58.780 --> 04:01.408
but also create opportunities
for my kids.

04:01.449 --> 04:04.160
So, I'm here to win it.

04:04.202 --> 04:07.706
Deejay, so, you were touring
with "Hamilton" for how long?

04:07.747 --> 04:10.333
Four years. Yeah.
Oh, my gosh.

04:10.375 --> 04:11.835
The experience of blinds...

04:11.876 --> 04:14.045
* Thinkin' and thinkin'
and thinkin' *

04:14.087 --> 04:17.590
...I was probably
the same nervous that I was

04:17.632 --> 04:20.844
the first time that
I performed with "Hamilton."

04:20.885 --> 04:24.305
Now I get to show the world
who I am as an artist,

04:24.347 --> 04:26.433
so I'm very excited about that.

04:26.474 --> 04:28.393
So, we're gonna do
some JT.

04:28.435 --> 04:29.894
Whew, that's crazy.
I'm very excited.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.604
Justin wasn't
releasing the song

04:31.646 --> 04:34.149
for singing competition shows
for a long time.

04:34.190 --> 04:35.734
Oh, shoot, the pressure.

04:35.775 --> 04:37.944
It's, like, one of my favorite
records of that time period.

04:37.986 --> 04:43.491
* You were my sun,
you were my earth *

04:43.533 --> 04:44.951
Yeah!
* But you didn't... *

04:44.993 --> 04:47.495
John: I picked
for Deejay and Ephraim

04:47.537 --> 04:50.081
"Cry Me a River"
by Justin Timberlake.

04:51.166 --> 04:52.876
* Girl, I refuse... *

04:52.917 --> 04:55.462
John: Deejay has a perfect tone
for this song,

04:55.503 --> 04:56.963
has great falsetto.

04:57.005 --> 04:59.007
And you can tell he does it
with a lot of polish.

04:59.049 --> 05:02.969
But Ephraim's got this
raw energy,

05:03.011 --> 05:06.681
and he may not be as much
of a polished pro as Deejay,

05:06.723 --> 05:08.641
but he can put on
a great performance, too.

05:08.683 --> 05:10.602
And that raw energy
is contagious.

05:10.643 --> 05:12.562
* Cry me a river, yeah *

05:12.604 --> 05:14.397
John: Both of these guys
have a lot of swagger,

05:14.439 --> 05:15.899
and you need that
when you're doing

05:15.940 --> 05:18.151
an up-tempo
Justin Timberlake song.

05:18.193 --> 05:19.819
Yeah!

05:19.861 --> 05:21.488
Okay. Okay.

05:21.529 --> 05:23.114
Ephraim, I love
how powerful you are,

05:23.156 --> 05:26.368
but just think, like,
10% more finesse

05:26.409 --> 05:29.162
'cause when you go,
like, full all the time,

05:29.204 --> 05:31.623
it just takes a little bit
of the charm of the song

05:31.664 --> 05:32.957
off of it, you know?
Okay.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.834
Deejay, I would consider
when you do,

05:34.876 --> 05:36.711
"The damage is done,
so I guess I'll be leaving,"

05:36.753 --> 05:38.421
I think you should
just change the melody.

05:38.463 --> 05:42.008
Okay.
* The damage is done,
so I guess I'll be leaving *

05:42.050 --> 05:43.718
Something like that.
Sing. Come on, church.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.513
* The damage is done,
so I guess I'll be leaving *

05:46.554 --> 05:48.515
* Oh, oh *

05:48.556 --> 05:50.433
[ Laughs ]

05:50.475 --> 05:52.519
It would mean a whole lot
to make it to knockouts.

05:52.560 --> 05:53.853
I'm trying to make
my family proud.

05:53.895 --> 05:55.855
I'm trying to make
my nana proud.

05:55.897 --> 05:59.359
My nana passed away
in April of 2022.

05:59.401 --> 06:01.486
She was my biggest cheerleader.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.530
Before my
grandmother passed,

06:03.571 --> 06:06.866
I used her voice
in a piece of music of mine.

06:06.908 --> 06:11.121
Woman: I taught my daughter
how to be a good mother.

06:11.162 --> 06:14.416
And, you know,
look what she produced.

06:14.457 --> 06:16.334
Deejay:
It's helped me to be strong.

06:16.376 --> 06:19.546
Sometimes I'll listen to it
just to hear her voice.

06:19.587 --> 06:22.424
She was so proud of me
and all of the things

06:22.465 --> 06:24.509
that I've done
to get to this moment,

06:24.551 --> 06:26.553
and I know she's with me.

06:26.594 --> 06:29.222
Make sure you guys
don't sound too happy,

06:29.264 --> 06:30.515
'cause the song
is still --

06:30.557 --> 06:32.308
It's grimy.
He's pissed, you know?

06:32.350 --> 06:33.893
There are two steals
for every coach,

06:33.935 --> 06:37.063
so my goal is
that nobody goes home.

06:37.105 --> 06:39.899
I'm excited to see Deejay
and Ephraim do this together.

06:39.941 --> 06:41.901
I can't wait to see
how y'all stage it, too.

06:41.943 --> 06:43.445
They have different styles.

06:43.486 --> 06:45.739
Deejay's the polished pro,

06:45.780 --> 06:49.075
Ephraim's the energetic,
charismatic, raw singer,

06:49.117 --> 06:51.828
and I'm gonna have
a tough decision.

good ability to work the stage

17:35.930 --> 17:41.061
is not as big a deal as if they
are not connecting to the story.

17:41.102 --> 17:42.937
That's what music is there for.

17:42.979 --> 17:46.733
This song is a song that
Tony Brown, my producer, said,

17:46.775 --> 17:48.109
"Why don't we get
Vince Gill to come in

17:48.151 --> 17:49.402
and do the harmony parts?"

17:49.444 --> 17:51.529
So, he called me --
Tony did.

17:51.571 --> 17:54.657
He said, "You know,
this is sounding really good.

17:54.699 --> 17:57.118
Can we just let Vince
take a verse?"

17:57.160 --> 17:58.870
I said, "Heck, yeah."

17:58.912 --> 18:00.914
And so, it turned out
to be a duet.

18:00.955 --> 18:03.750
I still do it on concert,
and it's one of my favorites.
Yeah.

18:03.792 --> 18:05.377
It's perfect.
Thank you for picking it.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.420
You're welcome.
This song means
a lot to me, too.

18:07.462 --> 18:09.255
My mom and my dad used
to slow-dance to this
in our living room...

18:09.297 --> 18:11.132
Oh, no kidding.
...all the time
when I was younger.

18:11.174 --> 18:12.634
I love that!

18:12.676 --> 18:15.136
The memories of me
and my dad listening to Reba...

18:15.178 --> 18:16.805
* ...live your life... *

18:16.846 --> 18:19.766
...is a really close one
to me.

18:19.808 --> 18:22.727
We'd all just sit in
the living room and enjoy music.

18:22.769 --> 18:23.937
And Reba just so happened to be

18:23.978 --> 18:26.314
one of our family's
favorite artists.

18:27.065 --> 18:30.068
My dad passed away
when I was 7 years old.

18:30.110 --> 18:32.445
* If heaven wasn't
so far away *

18:32.487 --> 18:33.947
When I was doing the blinds,

18:33.988 --> 18:37.951
I feel like my dad was with me
in that very moment.

18:37.992 --> 18:43.039
He was the first person to say
that I was going to be in music.

18:43.081 --> 18:46.668
I am just so proud to be
in the country music business

18:46.710 --> 18:49.212
and proud that
you're representing us

18:49.254 --> 18:50.755
here on
"The Voice" today.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.799
My dad would have freaked out

18:52.841 --> 18:54.634
the second Reba
turned her chair,

18:54.676 --> 18:55.969
so I definitely feel like

18:56.011 --> 18:58.555
I'm doing him good
by singing this song.

18:58.596 --> 19:05.520
* The heart won't lie *

19:05.562 --> 19:07.272
* No, the heart *

19:07.313 --> 19:12.193
* Won't lie *

19:12.235 --> 19:13.236
Very good.

19:13.278 --> 19:14.612
Thank you.
Yeah!

19:14.654 --> 19:16.656
Love that arrangement
of it, too.

19:16.698 --> 19:18.783
Jordan, remember
on the very end of that,

19:18.825 --> 19:20.827
he's got a very
powerful voice.

19:20.869 --> 19:22.370
When you kind of
get into those soft,

19:22.412 --> 19:23.621
"The heart won't lie,"

19:23.663 --> 19:25.123
really get
in your mic on that.

19:25.165 --> 19:26.416
Let's do it.

19:26.458 --> 19:28.168
What are y'all thinking,
choreography wise?

19:28.209 --> 19:29.377
Ideally, I'd like to be

19:29.419 --> 19:30.837
a little more angled
toward each other.

19:30.879 --> 19:32.797
And part of my brand
is I wear shades on stage,

19:32.839 --> 19:34.132
but should
I lose the shades

19:34.174 --> 19:35.925
to be able to connect with him,
do you think?

19:35.967 --> 19:38.178
Being a love song,
it's a duet,

19:38.219 --> 19:39.346
I think glasses off.

19:39.387 --> 19:40.764
Okay.

19:40.805 --> 19:42.682
This song is definitely
not in my wheelhouse.

19:42.724 --> 19:44.517
Naturally,
being a divorced woman,

19:44.559 --> 19:46.644
I typically
don't sing love songs.

19:46.686 --> 19:47.979
I want to take
those shades off and say,

19:48.021 --> 19:50.523
"Okay, here for just
a brief moment, America,

19:50.565 --> 19:51.816
here's my heart.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.109
Don't break it."

19:53.151 --> 19:54.986
And, Jackson, also feel free
to take the mic out

19:55.028 --> 19:57.614
'cause she's pretty much
having to stay stationary.

19:57.655 --> 19:59.115
That'd be neat.

19:59.157 --> 20:02.118
And y'all went away
from the melody a little bit.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.788
* But the words
didn't come easily *

20:04.829 --> 20:06.706
Well, we can tighten that up,
for sure.

20:06.748 --> 20:08.208
Do y'all have
any questions for me?

20:08.249 --> 20:10.377
How do you deal with your
nerves before you go on stage?

20:10.418 --> 20:13.004
If you have any, 'cause you're,
I mean, a living legend, so...

20:13.046 --> 20:15.840
The way I make sure
the nerves are at a minimum

20:15.882 --> 20:18.718
is to be prepared,
have fun,

20:18.760 --> 20:21.513
and if you boo-boo,
laugh at yourself

20:21.554 --> 20:23.181
and the crowd
will laugh with ya.

20:23.223 --> 20:25.642
We were playing
Strawberry Festival
down in Florida.

20:25.684 --> 20:28.561
Yeah!
We started
a song called "Somebody."

20:28.603 --> 20:31.189
I start on the second verse.
I get tickled.

20:31.231 --> 20:33.650
I said, "Okay, stop.
Y'all gonna have to help me."

20:33.692 --> 20:35.777
And the whole crowd
started singing "Somebody."

20:35.819 --> 20:37.654
So, it was just fun.
Yeah.

have to make a choice.

27:28.732 --> 27:31.693

That's the hardest part.

Good job.
Thank you so much.

Jackson was actually better

27:34.404 --> 27:36.197
in this particular performance
in my mind.

27:36.239 --> 27:39.200
But if anybody knows me,
you know, I'm a bit picky.

This is crazy.
This is crazy.

28:43.556 --> 28:45.392
I feel like we have
very similar voices,

28:45.433 --> 28:47.352
but at the same time,
we have different styles

28:47.394 --> 28:48.978

ways of singing.

You will be singing...

It's a good one.

28:59.531 --> 29:01.741
Tanner -- I remember hearing him
for the first time,

29:01.783 --> 29:05.537
and his tone was just something
that stands out on its own.

29:05.578 --> 29:07.497
I've never been happier
to do a song

29:07.539 --> 29:09.457

a talented individual.

Come on.

29:20.218 --> 29:21.553
I feel like
I'm in my element.

29:21.594 --> 29:23.304
I know exactly how it feels
to be on a show,

29:23.346 --> 29:25.015
in the cameras,
in front of all the lights.

29:25.056 --> 29:27.475

with the artists.

How are you doing, man?

29:33.732 --> 29:35.358
Walking in and seeing Niall

29:35.400 --> 29:37.485
was a different experience
than at the blinds

29:37.527 --> 29:39.154
because the pressure is on now

29:39.195 --> 29:40.488
in the sense
that I need to prove

29:40.530 --> 29:42.741
that I was worth
turning around for.

Going through
the blind auditions

29:53.209 --> 29:55.337
was the craziest experience.

29:55.378 --> 29:56.629
That's honestly one
of my favorite voices

29:56.671 --> 29:58.214
I've heard
on the show this season.

29:58.256 --> 30:00.717
I've got one spot left
on my team.

30:00.759 --> 30:03.178
I would give anything.

30:03.219 --> 30:05.138
I definitely feel like
I made the right choice

30:05.180 --> 30:06.514
when I went with Niall.

30:06.556 --> 30:09.059
I just feel like he gets
who I am as an artist,

30:09.100 --> 30:10.560
and I want to help him
win again.

30:10.602 --> 30:12.645
Both of your auditions were,
like, incredible.

30:12.687 --> 30:14.564
Like, I was nervous
coming back.

30:14.606 --> 30:17.525
You know, it's my second season.
But what a way to start.

30:19.819 --> 30:22.364
* She can wound

30:22.405 --> 30:23.698
Niall: I paired Tanner
and Lennon together

30:23.740 --> 30:25.533
because it felt like
they were just two

30:25.575 --> 30:28.620
very sweet, folky,
singer-songwriter, male voices.

30:28.661 --> 30:31.664
* She hides like a child,
but she's always... *

30:31.706 --> 30:33.917
And the Billy Joel
"She's Always a Woman"

30:33.958 --> 30:35.335
is the perfect example of that.

30:35.377 --> 30:37.212
* And she'll promise... *

30:37.253 --> 30:39.172
Lennon's individual tone
will stand out

30:39.214 --> 30:40.382

He's an incredible talent.

30:41.716 --> 30:43.385
* And she'll carelessly
cut you... *

30:43.426 --> 30:46.221
I love the youth that I can hear
in Tanner's voice.

30:46.262 --> 30:48.348
He's a very tasteful,
colorful singer.

30:48.390 --> 30:51.685
Tanner: Singing in front
of Niall was definitely tough.

30:51.726 --> 30:53.687
There's so many nerves.
There's so much overthinking.

30:53.728 --> 30:56.147
But it's been one of
the most incredible experiences

* So before you go *

insane experience.

31:05.949 --> 31:09.494
It just sounded really
beautiful and airy and warm.

31:09.536 --> 31:11.579
Niall: It's so cool to hear
a tone like yours come through,

31:11.621 --> 31:13.456
and I feel like
I'm talking to a, you know,

31:13.498 --> 31:15.041
a younger version
of myself.

31:15.083 --> 31:16.459
Hearing that come from Niall,

31:16.501 --> 31:18.253
I knew who I was picking.

31:18.294 --> 31:19.713
I just feel like
he can help me so much

31:19.754 --> 31:21.923
because he had also been
doing competitions

31:21.965 --> 31:23.550
whenever he was young.

31:23.591 --> 31:25.677
I grew up kind of
in the music industry

31:25.719 --> 31:27.595
and kind of trying to get
into the acting industry,

31:27.637 --> 31:30.432
and I did a few commercials
whenever I was younger.

31:30.473 --> 31:31.725
I actually landed a commercial

31:31.766 --> 31:34.102
for a toy called
the Drop Dot Ball.

31:34.144 --> 31:35.437
It was super exciting,

31:35.478 --> 31:37.605
but I was, like,
I wanted something more.

31:37.647 --> 31:39.232
I wanted to really push myself

31:39.274 --> 31:41.276
to really pursue
my music career.

31:41.317 --> 31:43.111
I'm definitely going to try
my best for Niall,

31:43.153 --> 31:44.362
and I don't want
to let him down.

31:44.404 --> 31:46.031
[ Laughing ] Yes.

31:46.072 --> 31:48.283
Oh, I like that.
I like it a lot.

31:48.324 --> 31:49.617
Tanner,
one thing I would say

31:49.659 --> 31:51.703
is he's rallying
on the -- on the piano.

31:51.745 --> 31:53.705
I think sometimes it's easy
to get ahead of it.

31:53.747 --> 31:55.457
But you've actually got
more time than you think.

31:55.498 --> 31:57.167
* She can lead you
to love *

31:57.208 --> 31:59.961

or leave you *

* She can da, da, da, da, da,
da, da, da, da, da *

32:04.841 --> 32:05.800
Flow with it.
Yeah.

Just keep the...
like you're waltzing.

32:10.430 --> 32:13.725
Lennon, always try your best
to tell the story

32:13.767 --> 32:15.727
and have that in your head
as you're singing it.

32:15.769 --> 32:18.730
Think of all those
great women in your life

32:18.772 --> 32:19.856
while you're singing it.

32:19.898 --> 32:21.566
That's the perfect song
for that, man.

32:21.608 --> 32:23.818
To me, this song
just perfectly captures

32:23.860 --> 32:25.695
what it means to be
in love with someone.

32:25.737 --> 32:27.489
And I remember just listening
to this song

32:27.530 --> 32:29.240
when I was dating my wife,
Morgan.

32:29.282 --> 32:32.744
The lyrics hit so perfectly
because that's what love is.

32:32.786 --> 32:36.331
It's messy, but at the same
time, you're here for it.

32:36.373 --> 32:39.918
My wife, Morgan,
is the dream for every musician.

32:39.959 --> 32:42.921
I quit my job,
50 cents in my bank account,

32:42.962 --> 32:44.506
to play music full time.

32:44.547 --> 32:46.174
I wouldn't have been able
to do that

32:46.216 --> 32:47.509
without the support of my wife.

32:47.550 --> 32:49.761
And I know that
if I can keep going,

32:49.803 --> 32:51.888
I can just prove to her
that all the hard work

32:51.930 --> 32:53.723
that I've been putting in
is worth it.

32:53.765 --> 32:56.518
* Blame it all on yourself
'cause she's always... *

32:56.559 --> 32:58.895
Niall: I personally think
that Lennon and Tanner's battle

32:58.937 --> 33:01.856
really comes down
to who can tell the story.

33:01.898 --> 33:05.318
* But she's always
a woman to me *

33:05.360 --> 33:06.986
Yeah, there we go.
That's better.

33:07.028 --> 33:10.407
So, I think whoever can really
put that emotion down the lens

33:10.448 --> 33:13.410
to the people of America
and to us here in the chairs,

33:13.451 --> 33:15.036

this battle.

I mean, both of you are
mind-blowing in your own way.

37:04.182 --> 37:06.893
I mean, Lennon,
we are all fascinated by you

I was like, "Wait a minute."

right now,

I heard you.

Yes.

37:33.211 --> 37:34.879
That song has
an interesting story for me

because I wrote "All of Me"
like 10 years ago.

My manager was like, "You should
write a song to Chrissy..."

to get married at the time,

'She's Always a Woman.'"

is so beautiful.

It's so well-written
and inspired me

it was just magical.

And I just felt like
you were making it your own.

37:59.279 --> 38:00.864

so high.

was really good.

Tanner, the subject
in the song

38:18.381 --> 38:20.008
would change,
and you changed.

38:20.050 --> 38:22.385
You got more serious,
and then you would smile.

38:22.427 --> 38:26.056

you've got great stage presence.

a big decision to make here.

gonna be a great battle

in my gut said Lennon.

I've always been super attracted
to really interesting tones.

that has a tone
even remotely near him,

a very, very dark horse.
