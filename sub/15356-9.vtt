WEBVTT

00:47.960 --> 00:53.210
Sir, wouldn't it be better to be direct
and say it was a fabrication?

00:53.800 --> 00:56.030
Hey, that man...!

00:56.550 --> 00:58.130
Who are you?

01:02.820 --> 01:05.390
Na Na, grab Seo Yong Hak.

01:07.790 --> 01:09.650
Don't come any closer.

01:13.720 --> 01:16.420
I said don't come any closer!

01:19.890 --> 01:23.062
S... Sir, calm down.
I'll protect you...

01:23.063 --> 01:26.741
Shut up!
I told you not to provoke me.

02:25.400 --> 02:27.070
Wait!

02:27.330 --> 02:31.360
You’re the one who saved me
during the sniper incident last time, right?

03:08.430 --> 03:09.970
Stop.

03:14.080 --> 03:15.840
Get out.

03:48.240 --> 03:50.600
Useless kid...

03:52.980 --> 03:56.300
Boss! Yoon Sung!
Hurry, get in.

04:11.800 --> 04:13.560
What do we do now?

04:14.200 --> 04:17.959
When I was fighting City Hunter earlier,
I put a tracking device on him.

04:18.420 --> 04:19.279
Where’s the car?

04:19.300 --> 04:21.550
- Over there.
- Let's follow him!

04:33.130 --> 04:34.850
Go faster.

04:40.520 --> 04:42.560
Why did you save the girl?

04:42.580 --> 04:46.090
You should have killed her
and captured Candidate Seo!

04:47.650 --> 04:49.860
Boss, we don’t have much time.

04:49.880 --> 04:51.850
We have to quickly finish up and leave.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.250
Who are they?

05:20.290 --> 05:23.700
The other people who were involved
in Operation Clean Sweep?

05:23.740 --> 05:27.190
So it's...
Operation Clean Sweep...

05:27.210 --> 05:32.070
I can see you expected this,
because of the enormity of your crimes.

05:34.620 --> 05:36.180
Who are they?

05:36.230 --> 05:38.920
I’m really sorry about that time.

05:39.970 --> 05:42.820
I suppose you're here for revenge.

05:44.770 --> 05:52.890
Okay, but take me to a safe place first.

05:52.910 --> 05:54.690
Then I’ll tell you everything.

05:54.710 --> 05:58.540
You’re going to betray your comrades
in order to save yourself.

06:00.110 --> 06:02.530
You truly are a rotten man,
just as I thought.

06:13.600 --> 06:17.600
Do you think you’ll survive
because those guys are coming?

06:19.960 --> 06:21.780
Who are they?

06:49.960 --> 06:51.530
Hold it.

06:53.630 --> 06:55.830
They might have a hostage.

06:59.170 --> 07:00.840
We have to get out of here.

07:00.870 --> 07:03.940
You should know about guns more than anyone.

07:03.960 --> 07:09.430
You should know that if I pull the trigger
this time, a bullet will really come out.

07:19.560 --> 07:24.020
K... Kim Jong Shik.

07:24.340 --> 07:27.510
Former Education Minister
and Chairman of the Myung Mun

07:27.511 --> 07:30.611
University Foundation, Kim Jong Shik.

07:30.660 --> 07:34.620
Kim Jong Shik...
And who else?

07:34.640 --> 07:37.790
I... I’ll tell you.

08:01.089 --> 08:01.877
I'm sorry...!

08:55.890 --> 08:57.500
Hurry and get to the Prosecutor's Office.

08:57.520 --> 08:59.160
I’m on my way to deliver Candidate Seo.

08:59.210 --> 09:00.370
What are you trying to do?

09:00.390 --> 09:03.560
Why did I have to take Candidate Seo
to the warehouse?

09:03.600 --> 09:07.390
<i>Finding that out is also your job.</i>

09:11.590 --> 09:17.120
This shirt... It’s a brand name from France.
It’s a really famous one.

09:20.780 --> 09:22.600
Perfume smell.

09:22.900 --> 09:25.830
Find out the brand of the perfume
and about the shirt right away.

10:02.470 --> 10:04.630
[To Prosecutor Kim Young Joo]

10:07.960 --> 10:10.340
What’s going on?
Who is that?

10:13.620 --> 10:14.840
It’s the City Hunter again.

10:14.860 --> 10:16.530
It’s Candidate Seo.

10:16.550 --> 10:17.500
Is he dead?

10:20.660 --> 10:21.600
<i>Really?</i>

10:21.620 --> 10:22.520
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

10:22.540 --> 10:24.860
Is he dead or alive?

10:38.690 --> 10:39.660
Ask all hospitals to account
for their ambulances,

10:39.680 --> 10:41.736
and the cops to look for an
abandoned ambulance.

10:41.737 --> 10:43.002
Right away!

10:57.370 --> 10:59.300
Why am I here?

10:59.320 --> 11:01.070
Where’s Seo Yong Hak?

11:05.060 --> 11:06.360
Did Yoon Sung do this?

11:06.390 --> 11:11.330
Yeah... Seo Yong Hak
was delivered to the Prosecutor's Office.

11:11.350 --> 11:14.570
What the he** are you doing?!

11:26.090 --> 11:29.320
We found a suspicious looking ambulance,
but no one is here.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.360
<i>You dare defy me?</i>

11:47.400 --> 11:51.170
Please understand.
It was for both of our sakes.

11:51.190 --> 11:53.870
<i>Is this how you show your concern for me?</i>

11:58.000 --> 11:59.800
<i>Yoon Sung.</i>

11:59.820 --> 12:02.330
Ahjussi...
Ahjussi, what’s wrong with you?

12:02.350 --> 12:06.650
<i>I’m going to make everyone around you
suffer for your defiance.</i>

12:06.700 --> 12:10.850
If you defy me,
you'll be punished.

12:32.180 --> 12:33.850
Move.

12:57.240 --> 12:58.350
Ahjussi.

12:58.370 --> 13:00.040
Yoon Sung.

13:00.770 --> 13:02.290
I’m sorry.

13:02.340 --> 13:06.580
You dare ruin the plan like this!

13:09.920 --> 13:12.190
I could have killed him.

13:12.230 --> 13:13.600
Why did you hand him
to the prosecutor again?!

13:13.620 --> 13:16.860
Because I don't want to create
another me!

13:17.860 --> 13:19.561
If it weren’t for those five people,

13:20.471 --> 13:25.871
I could have lived happily
with a mother and father like everyone else!

13:25.920 --> 13:30.180
I want to kill those 5 people
more than anyone else!

13:30.430 --> 13:35.150
But we have to stop at revenge
that asks for more blood.

13:35.790 --> 13:42.510
After this is over, I want to live happily
with you, Father, and start over again.

13:42.530 --> 13:47.420
I'm going to kill those guys
even if I have to go to hell to do it.

13:47.440 --> 13:49.840
Are you still going to go against me?

13:52.730 --> 13:54.570
Answer me.

13:55.110 --> 13:56.580
Yes.

13:57.930 --> 13:59.780
Because that’s my revenge.

13:59.800 --> 14:02.580
Even if you start a war with me?

14:02.600 --> 14:07.080
War... even if I have to do more than that.

14:08.830 --> 14:14.830
Don’t harm people precious to me.
I’m going to protect them.

14:15.320 --> 14:17.080
Including you, Father.

14:30.290 --> 14:35.370
The female agent whom Yoon Sung saved,
find out who she is.

14:38.920 --> 14:41.090
Did you see his face?

14:41.900 --> 14:45.330
No... I didn’t see his face.

14:45.890 --> 14:50.150
He is tall, and I just saw his eyes.

14:50.660 --> 14:52.550
What did his eyes look like?

14:52.570 --> 14:57.340
His has big double-eyelids
and his eyes were...

15:06.680 --> 15:08.650
Kim Na Na.

15:09.270 --> 15:14.070
I can’t think of anything
because I’m in shock. I'm sorry.

15:14.090 --> 15:17.280
Okay.
Rest, then.

15:27.450 --> 15:29.850
Where did he go?

15:32.640 --> 15:35.340
I’m sorry, Ahjussi.
It was because of me.

15:35.360 --> 15:37.540
No, no.

15:38.120 --> 15:40.860
The boss is human too,
so he didn’t kill me.

15:42.620 --> 15:46.280
By the way, the injury on your shoulder is
ripped open again. What are we going to do?

15:46.430 --> 15:49.300
What about Na Na?
What happened to Na Na?

15:49.320 --> 15:50.410
I don’t know.

15:50.440 --> 15:52.340
I have to find out.

15:52.860 --> 15:53.970
Yoon Sung.

15:53.990 --> 15:56.282
Hey. Yoon Sung!
Hey, Man!

15:57.035 --> 15:59.059
Yoon Sung!
Hey, Man!

15:59.640 --> 16:03.500
Oh, no... Yoon Sung!
Yoon Sung!

16:03.520 --> 16:08.490
<i>This afternoon, Presidential
Candidate Seo was arrested...</i>

16:08.510 --> 16:11.870
I can’t believe someone like him
was running for president.

16:16.710 --> 16:18.810
Welcome...

16:22.450 --> 16:26.800
Excuse me...
You know Lee Yoon Sung, right?

16:26.910 --> 16:28.560
Lee Yoon Sung?

16:28.580 --> 16:30.030
Yes.

16:39.480 --> 16:43.360
If you’re not careful, your shoulder
could become permanently damaged.

16:46.980 --> 16:50.590
This is your house?

16:51.390 --> 16:56.160
You know another one of my secrets,
so you’re in more danger, Sae Hee.

16:56.180 --> 16:59.910
I’m thankful, because I think you
called me here since you trust me.

17:00.300 --> 17:02.590
Am I being weird?

17:03.720 --> 17:05.970
You’re going to be sleepy because of the
medicine I gave you for your shoulder.

17:05.990 --> 17:08.880
We have to get rid of the infection.

17:28.970 --> 17:31.110
Are you okay now?

17:31.800 --> 17:33.300
Yeah.

17:33.640 --> 17:36.230
What about Na Na?
Did you find out anything?

17:36.250 --> 17:40.000
Yeah. I heard she was treated for
minor wounds. She didn’t get really hurt.

17:40.020 --> 17:41.760
That’s good.

17:41.780 --> 17:43.840
She’s probably really in shock.

17:44.590 --> 17:46.600
Try to eat some rice porridge
so you can take your medicine.

17:46.620 --> 17:50.730
I think I’m going to have to leave
Na Na’s house.

17:50.750 --> 17:52.270
Why?

17:52.400 --> 17:54.050
Father...

17:54.480 --> 17:56.730
I don’t know what he’s going to do to Na Na.

17:56.750 --> 17:58.400
No way, not to Na Na...

17:58.420 --> 18:01.160
That’s the only way to protect Na Na.

18:01.480 --> 18:05.660
Hey, you...
Do you like Na Na?

18:05.680 --> 18:09.840
Is that why you didn’t go after
Candidate Seo and saved Na Na instead?

18:10.110 --> 18:13.910
Oh, so... if the exact same situation
happens again,

18:15.445 --> 18:17.311
would you still save Na Na?

18:17.350 --> 18:20.720
I don’t know.
I don't know either.

18:20.760 --> 18:26.350
I’m just scared that something
is going to happen to Na Na.

18:28.280 --> 18:33.740
I’m sorry, Yoon Sung.
If I hadn’t asked you to watch over Na Na...

18:36.750 --> 18:37.680
[Kim Na Na]

18:46.070 --> 18:47.210
Hello.

18:47.230 --> 18:49.110
Lee Yoon Sung?

18:49.760 --> 18:50.610
What?

18:50.630 --> 18:51.770
Where are you?

18:51.790 --> 18:52.910
I’m busy.
Hang up.

18:52.950 --> 18:54.150
<i>Hold on.</i>

18:55.090 --> 18:58.560
Are you hurt?

18:59.330 --> 19:00.830
No.

19:01.410 --> 19:03.870
You probably haven't heard yet
about the big case today, right?

19:03.890 --> 19:08.130
- Candidate Seo was...
- I said I am busy. Hang up.

19:54.820 --> 19:57.010
What?
What’s wrong... what?

19:57.030 --> 19:59.340
I can’t take it anymore.

19:59.620 --> 20:01.140
I’m worried about Na Na.

20:01.160 --> 20:03.580
Are you crazy, with your health?

20:05.850 --> 20:08.850
I’m going to see her for the last time.

20:09.219 --> 20:10.219
Yoon Sung!

20:10.220 --> 20:11.800
Yoon Sung.

20:12.530 --> 20:14.350
Yoon Sung!

20:15.570 --> 20:18.310
Yoon Sung, hey.
You can't.

21:09.910 --> 21:12.090
I want to see him.

21:13.850 --> 21:16.080
I’m worried about him.

21:22.310 --> 21:23.400
<i>Hey, Kim Na Na.</i>

21:32.180 --> 21:34.090
Do you know what time it is?

21:34.130 --> 21:36.310
It’s past 2:00 a.m.

21:36.570 --> 21:39.230
It's bad enough you shower
with the front door unlocked.

21:39.270 --> 21:40.018
Just because you know some judo,

21:40.019 --> 21:42.152
you think you can wander around
in the middle of the night?

21:42.180 --> 21:45.290
Do you think I like coming out here
in the middle of the night?

21:45.310 --> 21:50.240
I can’t sleep... and I’m worried,
so I came out to get some fresh air.

21:50.280 --> 21:53.340
Why didn't you come back earlier,
instead of making me worry?

21:53.360 --> 21:58.050
And why didn't you pick up your phone?
You kept me awake and put me in a bad mood.

21:58.740 --> 22:01.321
Who made me worry
and come out in the middle of the night?

22:01.322 --> 22:03.185
And now you're yelling at me...?

23:04.660 --> 23:09.670
Just because you can’t fall asleep
late at night... don’t go outside.

23:10.610 --> 23:12.860
Lock the front door.

23:13.180 --> 23:15.790
And don’t trust your judo skills too much.

23:17.230 --> 23:19.560
Be careful of strangers.

23:20.460 --> 23:25.820
Just because the kimchi is delicious,
don’t just eat that.

23:27.750 --> 23:32.540
And don’t just take care of Ddorong.
Take care of yourself, too.

23:36.780 --> 23:38.470
The coffee that you make...

23:40.955 --> 23:42.971
It's really good.

23:47.940 --> 23:50.150
Do you want some?

23:52.100 --> 23:53.700
Can you?

23:55.910 --> 23:58.330
Just give me a second.

25:10.010 --> 25:11.570
[Kim Na Na]

25:15.750 --> 25:17.830
I’m going to protect you.

25:19.030 --> 25:21.320
This is the only way.

25:30.680 --> 25:35.390
<i>The call cannot be connected.
Please leave a message at the beep.</i>

25:48.900 --> 25:50.810
Let’s see...

25:53.490 --> 25:56.610
Oh, you’re recovering fast.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.080
I think I’m a genius.

25:59.550 --> 26:01.880
Ahjussi is going to take you back,
go in the car with him.

26:01.900 --> 26:04.070
You’re not even going to give me breakfast
and just get rid of me?

26:04.090 --> 26:06.380
Wow... Your manners suck.

26:06.400 --> 26:11.330
Pretty Doctor, I made some delicious
radish soup. Eat some before you go.

26:11.350 --> 26:14.050
Yoon Sung, let’s eat together.

26:14.200 --> 26:18.090
Oh, by the way, what kind of relationship
do you have with Kim Jong Shik?

26:18.110 --> 26:20.620
I think I heard you saying his name
while sleeping.

26:25.290 --> 26:27.430
I wonder if the City Hunter knows.

26:27.470 --> 26:30.920
Chairman of the Myung Mun
University Foundation, Kim Jong Shik...

26:30.960 --> 26:35.850
His son... is Prosecutor Kim Young Joo.

26:44.390 --> 26:48.800
What? Kim Jong Shik’s son
is Prosecutor Kim Young Joo?

26:48.830 --> 26:50.330
Yes.

26:50.450 --> 26:52.810
There are some rumors that
their relationship is bad.

26:52.830 --> 26:56.710
And some are saying that he didn’t want
to gain attention because of his father,

26:56.730 --> 26:59.600
so he hid his family relations
within the prosecution department.

27:00.050 --> 27:02.563
Even if their relationship is bad,
they’re family.

27:02.564 --> 27:05.447
The arm always bends inwards.

27:12.470 --> 27:14.760
This whole time
we’ve been handing the mice over to a fox?

27:14.780 --> 27:18.250
Who would have guessed
that Kim Jong Shik’s son is Kim Young Joo?

27:18.300 --> 27:20.090
The world is really small.

27:20.120 --> 27:23.200
I should have looked into it.

27:23.220 --> 27:24.720
What have I been doing?

27:24.760 --> 27:27.680
Hey, how could you have known that?

27:27.700 --> 27:29.300
It's okay, don’t blame yourself.

27:29.330 --> 27:31.450
He looks like a promising prosecutor.
You did good, you did good.

27:31.470 --> 27:32.430
It’s okay, you did good.

27:32.450 --> 27:35.860
No. I’ve been lacking.

27:36.650 --> 27:38.810
I was lacking...

27:41.130 --> 27:42.620
It’s the boss.

27:45.920 --> 27:47.850
<i>Did you know</i>

27:48.300 --> 27:52.410
<i>that you’ve been handing the five
over to his son?</i>

27:53.890 --> 27:56.350
<i>Looking at your expression,
you’ve found out, too.</i>

27:56.400 --> 28:01.340
Kim Jong Shik, Lee Kyung Wan,
and Seo Yong Hak,

28:01.620 --> 28:04.580
whom you handed over,
they’re all going to die at my hands.

28:16.330 --> 28:18.540
A special agent who gets her gun snatched?

28:18.560 --> 28:20.470
In addition, you became a hostage?

28:20.490 --> 28:24.110
Are you being a good special agent?
A good bodyguard?!

28:24.130 --> 28:28.070
I’m sorry. I never suspected Candidate Seo
would turn like that and use me.

28:28.090 --> 28:31.350
This is the first time in Special Security
Agent history this has happened!

28:36.060 --> 28:39.310
I can’t cover up for you anymore.

28:39.530 --> 28:44.130
You, write a resignation letter
and wait at home for notification.

28:44.300 --> 28:44.900
What?

28:44.930 --> 28:48.670
You’ve been fired from the job and
the paperwork will be official in one week.

28:48.700 --> 28:50.820
Clean your desk out before you leave.

28:50.840 --> 28:53.880
That way you don’t have to come back
when you receive the official notice.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.830
Chief, please.

28:55.850 --> 28:58.230
What do you mean "please"?

28:58.270 --> 29:02.320
A special agent has to act
thinking of all possibilities.

29:02.380 --> 29:04.800
You don’t have the basics down.

29:12.600 --> 29:13.970
Does this make sense?

29:13.990 --> 29:17.370
What did Agent Kim do wrong
that she’s being dismissed?

29:18.610 --> 29:21.360
I really hate the chief!

29:30.030 --> 29:31.870
Lee Yoon Sung!

29:37.400 --> 29:39.320
Wait!

29:41.140 --> 29:42.220
<i>Kim Na Na.</i>

29:44.270 --> 29:45.880
Oh, Prosecutor Kim.

29:45.900 --> 29:49.220
How are you feeling?

29:49.240 --> 29:52.950
I’m okay.
But what are you doing here?

29:52.970 --> 29:55.920
I had something to ask you, Na Na.

29:55.940 --> 29:57.420
What is it?

29:57.440 --> 30:03.310
That day, the guy who pulled you up at the
broadcasting station, do you remember?

30:03.720 --> 30:04.720
Yeah.

30:04.750 --> 30:07.590
Did you see his face?

30:08.730 --> 30:11.430
No, I just saw his eyes.

30:11.450 --> 30:14.830
His eyes, didn’t they look familiar?

30:14.850 --> 30:19.950
No, I don’t think... Why?
Did they look familiar to you, Prosecutor?

30:19.970 --> 30:22.820
The blood spilled during the kidnapping,

30:22.840 --> 30:25.500
and the blood spilled yesterday at the
broadcasting station, are being compared.

30:25.520 --> 30:28.990
When the results come in, we can
find out if it’s the same person or not.

30:29.010 --> 30:32.320
If it’s 100 percent positive match,
we can use it as evidence to prosecute him.

30:33.060 --> 30:34.770
Oh.

30:36.310 --> 30:38.930
Oh, is that toy yours?

30:38.970 --> 30:41.723
No, it’s Lee Yoon Sung’s...

30:42.973 --> 30:45.580
Lee Yoon Sung gave it to me.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.600
This is a kid’s toy.

30:53.880 --> 30:56.850
Did the maid drop it?

31:05.890 --> 31:08.180
Look at him!

31:08.200 --> 31:09.680
Oh, my gosh.

31:13.790 --> 31:15.620
My husband died
because of a malfunctioning helicopter!

31:15.985 --> 31:20.521
It's because of you!
Bring him back!

31:20.540 --> 31:22.550
You bastard!

31:23.200 --> 31:25.320
Jerk!

31:31.550 --> 31:34.274
In order to accept delivery
of the defective military boots,

31:34.342 --> 31:36.174
you used bribery
to lower the industry standards, correct?

31:36.840 --> 31:38.020
Yes.

31:38.040 --> 31:40.690
You bribed an official
at the Ministry of the National Defense,

31:40.691 --> 31:42.491
whom you met through
Assemblyman Lee Kyung Wan, correct?

31:42.560 --> 31:44.010
Yes, that's right.

31:44.030 --> 31:47.084
You imported the fighter jets
made by the American company Maris,

31:47.119 --> 31:49.671
even though you knew
they were defective, correct?

31:50.310 --> 31:51.380
Yes.

31:51.400 --> 31:53.626
Someone sent in an anonymous letter

31:53.951 --> 31:55.991
listing all charges of corruption
against you, Sir.

31:56.030 --> 31:58.581
Everything was correct.

31:58.600 --> 32:00.820
Do you have any idea who it was?

32:03.390 --> 32:05.110
How would I know?

32:05.150 --> 32:08.080
Okay, then.
Let’s continue.

32:08.110 --> 32:11.550
While you were being pursued by the police,

32:11.580 --> 32:14.720
you used a special agent as a hostage
and almost committed murder, correct?

32:14.770 --> 32:17.120
Yes, yes.

32:18.240 --> 32:22.630
So hurry up with the prosecution
and send me to a safe prison somewhere.

32:22.650 --> 32:23.350
What?

32:23.380 --> 32:29.370
The City Hunter or whatever
wouldn't follow me there to kill me.

32:29.390 --> 32:31.360
Do whatever you want to me.

32:31.390 --> 32:34.150
I'll go along with it.

32:40.550 --> 32:42.120
What is it?

32:42.650 --> 32:43.980
That letter...

32:44.000 --> 32:46.890
The fingerprint analysis results are back.

32:48.070 --> 32:49.830
Who is it?

32:51.090 --> 32:52.480
I asked who it was.

32:52.500 --> 32:54.370
They said it’s Lee Kyung Wan’s.

32:54.390 --> 32:56.100
Lee Kyung...

32:56.760 --> 32:59.720
Lee Kyung Wan?
That bastard...

32:59.760 --> 33:02.440
Because I didn’t get him a lawyer,
he wrote a letter against me? That...

33:02.460 --> 33:04.350
Calm down.

33:08.120 --> 33:12.980
They say
there’s no one you can trust in this world.

33:13.000 --> 33:17.050
The citizens almost chose you as president
because they have no one to trust.

33:19.140 --> 33:20.940
I’m going to ask one more thing.

33:20.970 --> 33:24.990
The dog tags around your neck,
just like Lee Kyung Wan,

33:25.010 --> 33:30.710
they're from elite special ops soldiers
who went missing in October 1983.

33:30.880 --> 33:34.590
If you know something about that,
please tell me.

33:35.700 --> 33:39.380
<i>Twenty-one people died,
it’s a big case.</i>

33:39.430 --> 33:44.650
<i>The president was involved,
it won’t be revealed.</i>

33:46.990 --> 33:48.870
I don’t know anything.

33:48.890 --> 33:50.860
You really don’t know?

33:51.930 --> 33:54.870
I said I don’t know.

33:56.260 --> 33:57.870
Okay.

33:58.190 --> 34:00.520
That’s all for today.

34:09.170 --> 34:11.250
I’m going crazy.

34:11.290 --> 34:15.360
Information on those army tags
is blocked through 2030.

34:15.580 --> 34:18.170
And we’re back where we started,
back where we started...

34:18.190 --> 34:22.260
Prosecutor Jang, is there any way we can
access the blocked files from that case?

34:22.300 --> 34:25.340
Wait until 2030.

34:27.270 --> 34:29.350
What about the president?

34:33.900 --> 34:36.610
[Republic of Korea Soldier,
Military Honors Ceremony]

34:40.360 --> 34:41.580
Certificate.

34:41.600 --> 34:42.989
Go Ki Woo.

34:43.010 --> 34:44.896
The aforenamed is honorably discharged
from military service,

34:44.897 --> 34:47.097
rank Private, First Class, due to an injury.

34:47.157 --> 34:49.556
In commendation of his love of the military,

34:49.590 --> 34:53.420
we hereby appoint him an
Honorable Veteran of the Republic of Korea.

35:04.640 --> 35:06.530
Thank you.

35:07.000 --> 35:11.780
Every night I was on duty,
I would make this pledge to myself:

35:12.100 --> 35:16.830
“Mother, I’m on duty right now,
in this dark night."

35:17.070 --> 35:19.040
"Please sleep peacefully."

35:19.080 --> 35:22.800
"Mi Sun, your oppa is on watch for tonight."

35:22.910 --> 35:26.850
"Please don't allow your heart to waver
while I’m in the army, and dream about me.”

35:30.170 --> 35:34.650
Even though I’m standing here,
having lost a leg,

35:34.860 --> 35:37.280
I still do not regret
having joined the military.

35:37.300 --> 35:41.290
I wanted to have an outstanding career
in the army, but my time here was cut short.

35:41.310 --> 35:45.700
It is my greatest regret,
that I couldn’t leave behind a brave legacy.

35:45.720 --> 35:48.570
If not for the City Hunter,
we might have elected a president

35:48.571 --> 35:51.716
responsible for rotting the soldiers' bodies
with defective boots.

35:51.780 --> 35:57.480
Our young men sacrifice their youth
to serve and protect this country.

35:57.500 --> 36:01.910
Please, I ask all those
who are serving in the government...

36:01.950 --> 36:03.926
Instead of thinking of it
as sending others' sons to the army,

36:03.927 --> 36:06.642
please protect the beautiful youth
of our Republic of Korea.

36:07.352 --> 36:08.822
That is my request to you.

36:11.610 --> 36:13.820
Salute!

36:20.050 --> 36:22.060
Salute!

36:37.261 --> 36:38.561
Thank you.

36:42.560 --> 36:44.790
Here.
Congratulations.

36:47.310 --> 36:49.310
Great job.

36:49.440 --> 36:50.980
Mr. President, hello.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.270
Oh, it’s been a while.
You’ve been well, yes?

36:53.310 --> 36:54.830
Yes.

37:21.970 --> 37:23.810
Mr. President.

37:24.750 --> 37:26.360
Mr. President.

37:28.410 --> 37:31.350
I’m Prosecutor Kim Young Joo,
from the Seoul Prosecutor's Office.

37:35.310 --> 37:38.930
Kim Young Joo... Kim Jong Shik’s son.

37:38.950 --> 37:40.900
What are you doing here?

37:40.920 --> 37:42.290
The event today is private.

37:42.310 --> 37:46.750
I had to see you, Mr. President. I realize
I'm imposing on you, but I had to come.

37:46.770 --> 37:47.580
What is it?

37:47.620 --> 37:49.669
Top secret files from October 1983,
on elite soldiers who are missing in action,

37:49.670 --> 37:51.370
are locked until 2030.

37:51.371 --> 37:55.180
Please allow us access to those files.

37:55.210 --> 37:59.550
Even though I’ve asked the director
and the chairman, I’ve been rejected.

37:59.600 --> 38:03.620
So, as a last resort,
I’ve come to ask you.

38:03.670 --> 38:09.640
October 1983,
soldiers who are missing in action...

38:09.680 --> 38:15.660
Yes. Lee Kyung Wan and Seo Yong Hak
are both definitely involved in that case.

38:15.680 --> 38:17.507
If that case can’t be accessed,

38:17.508 --> 38:20.938
we have no other leads
on the City Hunter investigation.

38:20.950 --> 38:25.660
It’s not my call to allow access
to top secret government files.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.740
I’ll discuss it
with the other departments involved.

38:28.770 --> 38:33.330
Thank you.
I’ll be waiting for a positive answer.

38:40.670 --> 38:42.560
You better do well.

38:43.140 --> 38:44.665
Is your leg okay?

38:47.400 --> 38:51.120
Lee Yoon Sung.
What are you doing here?

38:51.221 --> 38:52.221
You can go ahead.

38:54.140 --> 38:57.380
The team told me to come,
to congratulate a co-worker’s brother.

38:57.420 --> 38:59.180
Oh, really?

38:59.200 --> 39:03.030
By any chance, do you know
a Korean American named Steve Lee?

39:03.080 --> 39:05.430
He owns a deer ranch in Wyoming.

39:05.450 --> 39:07.590
Steve Lee?

39:07.980 --> 39:10.550
No.
I don’t know him.

39:11.360 --> 39:13.570
I’m a little busy.

39:29.420 --> 39:31.710
Why are you abusing me like this?!

39:31.730 --> 39:33.770
Is this training?
This is torture!

39:33.790 --> 39:35.800
Don’t talk and just follow along.

39:35.840 --> 39:38.800
Learning how to fall
is part of the lesson, okay?

39:45.630 --> 39:51.410
This isn’t teaching,
you’re just throwing me around angrily.

39:52.550 --> 39:55.686
Then should I do a move
where you remain in one position instead?

39:55.687 --> 39:56.887
What?

40:00.410 --> 40:03.040
A special agent has no blood or tears.

40:03.080 --> 40:06.060
They can’t make any mistakes.
They’re a bulletproof shield.

40:06.100 --> 40:09.790
Even if the person they're guarding
takes them hostage, they can’t say anything.

40:09.810 --> 40:11.840
That’s what I’m so angry about.

40:18.780 --> 40:24.090
Just... throw me until you’re
not angry anymore. Do it...

40:26.340 --> 40:30.880
You’re really going to...
Why are you...?

40:37.350 --> 40:42.110
Instead of Kim Na Na, I’m going to be your
trainer temporarily, so stay really focused.

40:43.110 --> 40:45.680
Are you sick?
You look sick.

40:45.700 --> 40:48.870
No, I think I have indigestion.

40:49.170 --> 40:50.630
Temporarily? Until when?

40:50.670 --> 40:54.660
She might not be able to come back,
if HR decides she’s to be fired.

40:54.700 --> 40:59.320
Fired?
For having her gun taken yesterday?

40:59.450 --> 41:01.020
Isn’t that too much?

41:01.040 --> 41:03.540
It’s a huge error
having your gun taken while out in action.

41:03.570 --> 41:05.960
It was a mistake hiring a female agent
in the first place.

41:06.010 --> 41:08.020
I only hired her
because of her family relations.

41:08.060 --> 41:10.160
But she only dirtied the name
of special agents.

41:10.200 --> 41:13.820
Agent Kim Na Na put her life on the line
and did her best.

41:13.850 --> 41:16.590
You say that like you saw her in action.

41:17.020 --> 41:18.880
I saw it on the news.

41:18.900 --> 41:20.135
Did her best?

41:21.095 --> 41:22.026
Right...

41:22.030 --> 41:26.050
Flipping someone over, it’s a technique of
using little force to flip over someone big.

41:26.070 --> 41:27.830
Hold them like this...

41:29.610 --> 41:31.360
Lee Yoon Sung, what is this?

41:34.960 --> 41:36.830
Chief.

41:37.100 --> 41:39.910
I learned that from Agent Kim Na Na.

41:51.920 --> 41:52.890
Professor Kim.

41:52.910 --> 41:56.830
Can I have the USB back that I lent you
with the government backup files?

41:56.850 --> 41:58.580
Hold on.

41:59.290 --> 42:00.790
Oh.

42:00.900 --> 42:03.060
It’s a present for a girl, right?

42:04.750 --> 42:07.370
It has a pink ribbon on it.

42:07.430 --> 42:08.440
Who is it? Girlfriend?

42:08.460 --> 42:09.810
Did someone introduce you to her?

42:09.830 --> 42:14.350
Or hunting? Booking?

42:15.610 --> 42:17.690
I keep secrets really well.

42:17.730 --> 42:20.560
In the Communications Network Team,
I'm known for being the most heavy-lipped.

42:20.580 --> 42:25.080
It looks heavy from the outer appearance
too. Very thick...

42:48.500 --> 42:49.770
[Kim Na Na]

42:52.450 --> 42:53.390
What?

42:53.430 --> 42:57.030
Um, Lee Yoon Sung.
Can you come home for a little bit?

42:57.050 --> 42:58.620
I’m busy.

43:04.100 --> 43:06.070
Are you really busy?

43:17.871 --> 43:19.371
What the...?
What's wrong?

43:37.100 --> 43:38.470
Thank you.

43:38.490 --> 43:43.930
Oh, you’re a Blue House special agent,
following your father's path.

43:43.980 --> 43:46.974
Yes.
I thought it looked cool

43:46.975 --> 43:51.283
how he was running around and protecting
people, doing a job not everyone can do.

43:53.160 --> 43:56.290
That's a very eye-catching necklace.

43:56.310 --> 43:58.370
Oh, this?

43:58.450 --> 44:04.450
I was at the scene during the sniper attack.
The person who saved me dropped this.

44:04.750 --> 44:07.320
Was it the person called City Hunter?

44:07.340 --> 44:10.100
I don’t really know.

44:10.510 --> 44:12.876
Oh, if you came here

44:12.877 --> 44:17.230
because you misinterpreted
things between me and Yoon Sung, I...

44:19.040 --> 44:20.450
Father.

44:20.470 --> 44:22.330
Yoon Sung.

44:22.720 --> 44:24.330
You came?

44:50.920 --> 44:53.340
You’re living together.

44:54.090 --> 44:56.320
Do you love that girl?

44:59.470 --> 45:01.270
No.

45:06.000 --> 45:09.090
I've always said that a strong denial
is actually an affirmation.

45:09.580 --> 45:14.590
When I shot at Seo Yong Hak,
you saved that girl.

45:19.730 --> 45:24.570
You foolish boy...
I told you not to love anyone.

45:25.510 --> 45:31.080
Heed my warning.
Because of you, she could die.

45:49.110 --> 45:51.080
Did he leave?

45:51.530 --> 45:54.060
He didn’t leave misinterpreting
our relationship, did he?

45:54.080 --> 45:55.990
I tried to tell him, but...

45:56.010 --> 45:57.770
Don’t worry about it.

45:58.040 --> 46:01.660
I’m just worried that you got stuck
in an awkward situation.

46:01.690 --> 46:03.516
Because I have so many girls,

46:03.517 --> 46:06.242
it's been a while since my father
paid attention to things like that.

46:27.260 --> 46:29.230
The boss went to Na Na’s house?

46:29.290 --> 46:31.560
He sent a scary warning.

46:31.820 --> 46:35.590
"I’m going to kill Kim Jong Shik right away,
so follow me..."

46:35.610 --> 46:38.070
"Or else I’m going to do something
to Na Na..."

46:38.690 --> 46:40.090
I’m going to have to move my things out
tomorrow.

46:40.110 --> 46:43.810
Oh, no!
Because of me, Na Na too...

46:54.480 --> 46:56.340
This is Na Na’s.

46:58.440 --> 47:01.800
Let’s find Kim Jong Shik first.
It’s urgent.

47:08.890 --> 47:10.800
Yoon Sung, take your medicine.

47:12.380 --> 47:14.840
I hacked into Kim Jong Shik’s
secretary's computer.

47:14.870 --> 47:17.220
Kim Jong Shik isn’t in Korea right now.

47:17.240 --> 47:20.010
He’s currently in Zurich
for the World Collegiate Conference

47:20.030 --> 47:21.750
He is?
That’s good.

47:21.780 --> 47:23.158
He’ll come back to Korea in 5 days.

47:23.159 --> 47:25.963
We have to find out
if he has committed any wrongdoings.

47:25.980 --> 47:27.650
- If there aren't any...
- There is.

47:27.670 --> 47:30.090
There is, there definitely is.
There is.

47:30.110 --> 47:31.230
How do you know that, Ahjussi?

47:31.270 --> 47:34.710
If I say there is, there is.
Don’t question an adult.

47:34.740 --> 47:36.030
Take your medicine before it cools down.

47:36.050 --> 47:37.870
Take it before you continue.

47:57.760 --> 48:05.377
Make... me... coffee...

48:24.730 --> 48:29.650
You’re working in the coffee shop where you
worked before, because you might get fired?

48:30.530 --> 48:33.640
What am I going to do if I really get fired?

48:33.790 --> 48:37.040
I didn’t tell you everything,
but I’m in a tight situation.

48:37.060 --> 48:40.450
You should have argued
that it was an uncontrollable situation.

48:40.470 --> 48:42.870
You’re right.
An uncontrollable situation...

48:42.890 --> 48:45.650
Why didn’t I think of that then?

48:45.970 --> 48:47.640
Da Hye, you’re quite smart.

48:47.660 --> 48:50.640
I’ll talk with the chief, too.

48:50.660 --> 48:53.900
Instead of worrying about you...
This is too much!

48:53.920 --> 48:56.680
Da Hye, how is the studying going?
Is Lee Yoon Sung teaching you well?

48:56.700 --> 48:59.320
Study time is torture.

48:59.470 --> 49:01.160
If I look at his sparkling eyes,
my eyes hurt.

49:01.180 --> 49:03.230
His ears are so perfect.

49:03.280 --> 49:08.250
When I look at him from head to toe,
it feels like my neck is going to break.

49:08.270 --> 49:09.320
What do I do?

49:09.340 --> 49:11.140
Then change to Go Ki Joon.

49:11.160 --> 49:12.225
I heard in Daechi-dong,

49:12.226 --> 49:14.346
he's famous for guessing
what the exam questions are going to be.

49:14.420 --> 49:16.960
You might as well just tell me
to close my eyes and just sleep.

49:16.980 --> 49:20.350
Hey!
What’s wrong with Go Ki Joon?

49:20.450 --> 49:21.650
He’s actually taller.

49:21.670 --> 49:23.820
He’s only taller.

49:30.370 --> 49:33.520
Ahjussi, pack my things for me first.
I’ll go after getting treated.

49:33.540 --> 49:35.060
Okay.

49:35.940 --> 49:37.120
Hurry up.

49:37.180 --> 49:38.700
Yeah.

49:42.060 --> 49:43.330
Prosecutor.

49:43.370 --> 49:47.250
The shirt that the City Hunter was wearing
has never been imported into Korea.

49:47.270 --> 49:48.530
It’s only sold overseas?

49:48.550 --> 49:50.850
And the perfume smell it had...

49:51.300 --> 49:54.981
It's a limited edition scent,
Chanel’s Bath and Body Shower Gel.

49:55.000 --> 49:56.820
As soon as the employee smelled it,
she knew recognized it right away.

49:56.860 --> 49:58.698
It's a product
produced in limited quantities.

49:58.700 --> 50:02.674
It's often out of stock,
so there's a waiting list.

50:02.690 --> 50:05.090
I got the waiting list.

50:06.090 --> 50:07.700
We eat working nights and have snacks...

50:07.720 --> 50:10.850
There’s no way to make my waist smaller.

50:14.810 --> 50:16.280
[28. Lee Yoon Sung]

50:17.810 --> 50:19.610
Lee Yoon Sung.

50:22.180 --> 50:25.670
When I first saw him, he was with
Lee Kyung Wan’s girlfriend, Kim Mi Hee.

50:25.690 --> 50:31.210
The day Seo Yong Hak met Hudson
at the hotel, he was also there that day.

50:31.240 --> 50:34.530
The video played at the debate
was filmed at the hotel that day.

50:34.560 --> 50:39.460
He said he doesn't know Steve Lee,
but the toy at that house...

50:39.500 --> 50:43.120
looks like the same one that Kim Na Na had.

50:43.230 --> 50:46.030
The night Seo Yong Hak
almost got kidnapped,

50:46.060 --> 50:49.650
Lee Yoon Sung never went home
and wore my clothes that Sae Hee had.

50:49.680 --> 50:55.120
That night, the City Hunter was shot...
so he had to change clothes.

51:01.200 --> 51:05.740
Then... Sae Hee.

51:06.940 --> 51:08.840
I have to go somewhere.

51:11.930 --> 51:13.550
<i>Sae Hee.</i>

51:13.850 --> 51:15.310
Young Joo.

51:15.330 --> 51:17.540
Why was Yoon Sung wearing my clothes?

51:17.580 --> 51:20.560
Huh? What is this that you’re asking me
out of nowhere?

51:20.580 --> 51:22.048
The day Seo Yong Hak was elected
as his party's presidential candidate

51:22.049 --> 51:23.899
and nearly got kidnapped,

51:23.900 --> 51:29.300
Lee Yoon Sung came here
and you gave him my clothes. Right?

51:29.490 --> 51:31.160
It was raining and his clothes were wet.

51:31.180 --> 51:33.300
It didn’t rain that day.

51:34.240 --> 51:38.570
You draw a circle with your finger
when you’re lying. That hasn't changed.

51:41.590 --> 51:43.820
Were you with him?

51:44.570 --> 51:47.630
It’s a little awkward
talking to my ex-husband about my new man.

51:47.650 --> 51:52.880
You, did you treat Lee Yoon Sung like
you did when I got hurt chasing a criminal?

51:52.900 --> 51:54.780
Lee Yoon Sung got hurt?

51:54.800 --> 51:58.360
Then he probably went to the hospital,
why would I treat him?

51:59.020 --> 52:00.740
You don’t have to tell me.

52:00.760 --> 52:02.830
I can find out.

52:08.690 --> 52:12.630
[Biohazard Waste]

52:40.380 --> 52:41.940
It would have been bad,

52:41.980 --> 52:44.850
if I had thrown away your
bloodstained clothes in the biohazard waste.

52:44.880 --> 52:46.270
Take it.

52:46.290 --> 52:48.580
I’m in your debt several times over.

52:48.730 --> 52:50.810
Why do you keep helping me?

52:50.980 --> 52:52.900
I feel bad for animals that lose their way.

52:54.360 --> 52:56.501
You look like you lost your way.

52:57.430 --> 53:01.340
I gave you some medication to
prevent infection, so you might get sleepy.

53:01.390 --> 53:03.290
Don’t drive.

53:04.280 --> 53:05.890
Thank you.

53:12.700 --> 53:15.630
Yoon Sung. Do you know?

53:16.020 --> 53:21.110
When you moved into this house,
I finally saw you truly laugh.

53:21.130 --> 53:23.380
Laughing without thinking about anything...

53:23.400 --> 53:25.570
Laughing because you liked it...

53:25.760 --> 53:28.010
Laughing because you were happy...

53:31.290 --> 53:34.070
This house was really good for you.

53:34.650 --> 53:36.960
Who cares if a house is as big as a mansion?

53:36.980 --> 53:39.890
Every day,
it’s about punishment and revenge...

53:39.920 --> 53:42.400
Why are you falling?

53:49.470 --> 53:51.520
What is this doing here?

54:05.210 --> 54:06.090
Did you pack everything?

54:06.110 --> 54:07.950
Yeah, yeah.

54:07.970 --> 54:09.790
Did you get treated?

54:10.160 --> 54:12.580
I’m a little sleepy from the anesthetic.

54:12.620 --> 54:14.440
I found this.
Why don't you drink it?

54:14.460 --> 54:18.530
No.
I’m not going to drink this.

54:19.690 --> 54:21.250
Just drink it, why are you holding onto it?

54:21.270 --> 54:23.070
I’ll drink it later.

54:23.970 --> 54:29.580
Na Na doesn’t know
that you’re the City Hunter, right?

54:29.650 --> 54:33.220
No, I don’t think she has noticed anything.

54:33.240 --> 54:35.940
That’s good, that’s good.

54:35.960 --> 54:38.110
Ahjussi, you go first.

54:38.150 --> 54:40.480
I have to at least say my last goodbyes
to Na Na before I leave.

54:40.530 --> 54:43.180
Take a taxi back then, I’ll take the car.

54:43.200 --> 54:44.270
Okay.

54:44.320 --> 54:47.570
Sit down and rest.
You look like you're going to fall over.

54:47.940 --> 54:51.900
- If I left something behind, you bring it.
- Yeah, I’ll call you.

55:21.350 --> 55:23.340
It's probably not.

55:25.390 --> 55:27.320
It’s not.

55:27.830 --> 55:31.285
I said I’ll make you japchae*
with only meat, (*cellophane noodle dish)

55:31.286 --> 55:32.912
so I’ll make it for you.

55:33.190 --> 55:35.330
It’s more delicious
if you put all of this in.

55:36.380 --> 55:38.390
Can I have half a pound of beef
to make japchae?

55:38.410 --> 55:40.320
Yes, Customer.

55:47.750 --> 55:49.720
He’s already here.

55:49.740 --> 55:51.840
His car isn’t here.

55:53.530 --> 55:57.070
He must be really tired
to be sleeping here.

56:18.680 --> 56:22.040
Lee Yoon Sung, wake up.

56:22.060 --> 56:24.850
Lee Yoon Sung, let’s eat.

57:01.850 --> 57:03.330
What are you doing?

57:04.960 --> 57:07.850
I had to cough.

57:08.660 --> 57:09.890
I was afraid I’d wake you.

57:09.910 --> 57:11.830
Come eat.

57:49.180 --> 57:54.540
You kept talking about japchae
with only meat. Try it.

57:54.580 --> 57:57.090
I can’t guarantee the taste, though.

58:00.540 --> 58:02.570
You’re not going to eat?

58:02.890 --> 58:04.800
Forget about that time.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.570
I played with you
because you’re so prideful and stiff.

58:08.610 --> 58:13.600
But if you act like this, it’s no fun.

58:17.450 --> 58:18.440
Lee Yoon Sung.

58:18.460 --> 58:21.890
We kissed once
and you're looking at me differently now.

58:22.400 --> 58:26.060
There's not much to you after all.
You're easy.

58:27.670 --> 58:28.780
Easy?

58:28.810 --> 58:29.520
Yeah.

58:30.725 --> 58:35.621
You're so easy, it's no fun.
I've lost my taste for it.

58:37.930 --> 58:39.880
You don’t have to say it like that.

58:39.900 --> 58:42.640
The person you saw me as
the first time is right.

58:42.710 --> 58:44.850
I’m that kind of person.

58:45.850 --> 58:47.500
I moved my things out.

58:47.520 --> 58:51.870
You can live here as long as you want.
I won’t ask you to move out.

58:51.940 --> 58:54.660
Let’s at least say hi
when we see each other at the Blue House.

58:54.680 --> 58:59.050
That way, we won’t feel awkward.

59:42.890 --> 59:45.050
I can’t love.

59:48.050 --> 59:50.340
That’s my fate.

01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:48.470
You came back quickly.

01:01:48.490 --> 01:01:51.360
I thought
you were going to eat dinner together.

01:01:53.890 --> 01:01:58.330
Na Na was probably surprised
that you moved all your things out.

01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:05.480
By the way, did you collect all this knowing
Kim Jong Shik was one of the targets?

01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:06.910
Why did you bring that?

01:02:06.930 --> 01:02:09.590
It was on the sofa with all your stuff,
so I brought it.

01:02:09.610 --> 01:02:11.600
But, that’s Na Na’s.

01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:21.820
Why did she collect these?

01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:28.501

He wants you
to go to the hospital right now.
