45:55.586 --> 45:57.622
Sophie, are you all right?

45:57.755 --> 45:59.256
There's a wolf under my bed.

45:59.382 --> 46:01.589
ANITA: I think you had
a nightmare, that's all.

46:01.717 --> 46:02.752
Don't be frightened.

46:02.885 --> 46:04.671
Cuddle.

46:06.931 --> 46:08.671
I'm sorry, Sophie.
I'm not allowed to touch you

46:08.808 --> 46:10.924
without your mummy or daddy
saying it's all right first.

46:11.060 --> 46:12.095
Cuddle!

46:20.152 --> 46:22.689
It was eating me.

46:25.950 --> 46:27.986
For as long as I am with you...

46:28.119 --> 46:30.576
no harm will ever come to you.

46:30.705 --> 46:32.536
LAURA:
Anita!

46:34.333 --> 46:35.493
Mats, have you seen Anita?

46:38.045 --> 46:41.082
Anita, get away from her!

46:41.215 --> 46:42.455
Go and get in the car.

46:42.591 --> 46:44.001
-Right now.
-Where are you going?

46:44.135 --> 46:45.921
LAURA:
I'm sorry, Sophie.

46:46.053 --> 46:47.304
Anita has to go away.
Say goodbye, please.

46:47.430 --> 46:49.466
-No! Why?
-LAURA: She's broken.

46:49.598 --> 46:51.099
No, she isn't!
She's my friend!

46:51.225 --> 46:53.887
Soph, please, darling,
say goodbye.

46:57.732 --> 47:00.940
Sophie, if your mummy says
I'm broken, then I must be.

47:01.068 --> 47:03.229
Your mummy wouldn't lie.

47:03.362 --> 47:06.320
And if I'm broken, I can't
look after you properly, can I?

47:06.449 --> 47:07.655
Goodbye.

47:07.783 --> 47:10.445
[Sniffles, sobs]

47:11.704 --> 47:13.786
Bye, Mattie.

47:17.001 --> 47:18.707
I'll look after her.

47:18.836 --> 47:20.076
LAURA:
Thanks.

47:20.212 --> 47:21.543
MATTIE:
Hey.Shh.

47:21.672 --> 47:23.537
It's okay.
It's okay.

47:23.674 --> 47:27.292
Hey, you've still got the most
badass big sister in the world.

47:33.517 --> 47:34.723
ANITA: Would you like me
to drive, Laura?

47:34.852 --> 47:35.386
No!

47:35.519 --> 47:37.305
May I ask where
you're taking me?

47:38.522 --> 47:39.511
Back.

47:41.901 --> 47:43.516
[Car door closes]

47:44.570 --> 47:46.606
[Engine turns over]
