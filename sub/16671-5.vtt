Ashy Slashy's going to kill us all!

00:21.720 --> 00:24.371
Been a lot of weird shit
happening around town lately.

00:24.520 --> 00:25.521
We got to move.

00:25.680 --> 00:27.682
If we do not get to my spawn
before they raise Baal,

00:27.880 --> 00:29.848
I will not have the strength
to fight him.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.526
Ash!
The Delta, it's possessed!

00:32.680 --> 00:34.170
We're going to die here.
This car's going to kill us.

00:35.600 --> 00:38.444
Pablo, our destinies
are intertwined.

00:40.280 --> 00:42.726
I had a vision. This is how
we get rid of the book for good.

- Yeah, that's what I told them, too!

04:54.360 --> 04:55.725
- Chet.

04:55.880 --> 04:58.201
- They got you too?
- Yeah, but you know what?

04:58.400 --> 05:00.926
It was worth it.
Know why?

Need your signature here.

05:08.560 --> 05:12.246
You're being officially charged with drunk
driving and solicitation of a prostitute.

Hey, Joanie, how are you?

05:24.080 --> 05:25.923

You know, itchy.

05:26.080 --> 05:28.082
I know that feeling.

05:28.240 --> 05:30.720
- Chet, how are you?
- Itchy, too.

05:33.240 --> 05:34.605
Great work, Margie.

05:34.760 --> 05:36.762
You got the perp in custody,

05:36.920 --> 05:40.641
and, uh, I think we're looking at
the murder weapon right here.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.609

05:55.760 --> 05:57.649
I found her on the shower floor.

05:57.800 --> 05:58.961
- What?
- Doped up,

05:59.120 --> 06:01.282
and rambling about killer cars.

06:01.440 --> 06:05.047
And now Amber's mom is calling me,
saying that her daughter's missing.

06:05.200 --> 06:07.806
Ash:
Hey, that's my phone call!

06:07.960 --> 06:09.371
- What...
- I get a phone call!

06:09.520 --> 06:10.726
- Is that Ash?
- Uh-huh.

06:10.880 --> 06:13.281
Thomas,
what is going on around here?

06:13.440 --> 06:16.410
- Don't worry about him. Marge?
- I'll deal with him.

Hey, I want a lawyer.

06:47.160 --> 06:49.003
Then call one.

06:49.160 --> 06:51.561
Who's gonna stop you?

06:51.760 --> 06:53.205
Wow.

06:53.360 --> 06:55.249
Are all lady cops as soft
and cuddly as you?

06:55.400 --> 06:58.006
Come on, handsome.
Phone's that way.

06:58.160 --> 07:01.004
(chuckles) Don't worry, Chet.
I'll send you a fruitcake.

07:01.160 --> 07:03.288
Chet:
Oh, great. What?

07:04.840 --> 07:07.411
- You've got five, sugar.
- Oh, I got eight.

07:07.560 --> 07:09.847
But I know
how to make it feel like five.

07:31.720 --> 07:33.529

07:33.720 --> 07:35.722
Baal on phone:
They call you the "Jefe"?

07:35.880 --> 07:39.566
- Who is this?
- Let's see what you're made of.

07:39.720 --> 07:42.166

07:46.720 --> 07:48.961

07:49.120 --> 07:50.406
(indistinct whispering)

07:50.560 --> 07:52.608
Excuse me.
We're looking for Ash Williams?

07:52.760 --> 07:55.286
- We heard he got arrested.
- That's right.

07:55.440 --> 07:57.886
Ah. Howdy, cowboy.

07:58.080 --> 07:59.570
Keeping dry?

07:59.720 --> 08:01.802
Uh, what is she talking about?

08:02.000 --> 08:03.604
I, uh...

08:03.760 --> 08:05.489
Just tell us where Ash is, dipshit.

08:05.640 --> 08:07.563
I'm right here.

08:07.720 --> 08:10.485
There is some bad juju in this place,
and we've got...

08:10.640 --> 08:12.244
Hey, good-looking.

08:12.400 --> 08:13.765
You here to break me out,
or break me in?

08:13.920 --> 08:16.764
Don't move. Margie!

08:16.920 --> 08:20.083
- What do you mean, "There's bad juju?"
- Hey! That means you, too.

08:20.240 --> 08:21.321
- Nobody move!
- Whoa.

08:21.520 --> 08:24.251
I'll explain later. Right now,
we got to lock, load, and regroup.

08:24.440 --> 08:27.091

- (siren wails)

08:27.240 --> 08:29.083

- Oh, Christ.

08:31.440 --> 08:33.442

- What do you got, huh?!

08:33.600 --> 08:35.727
- 0h, my God!
' What do you got?!

08:41.120 --> 08:42.724

08:49.280 --> 08:50.964

- (Linda groans)

08:51.120 --> 08:52.531
Margie?

08:53.440 --> 08:55.807
You son of a bitch!

09:00.360 --> 09:02.362
It's not Ash.

09:03.720 --> 09:05.131
Then who was it?

09:06.640 --> 09:09.644
- (whispers) He's here.
- Who's where?

09:09.800 --> 09:12.406
Give me your keys.

09:13.560 --> 09:15.562
- Now.
- Okay.

09:15.720 --> 09:17.848
Okay. I got it.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.162
Slower, please.

09:20.320 --> 09:23.164
- I'll lock it down.
- (door opens)

09:23.320 --> 09:25.687
- You got any prisoners back there?
- Yes.

09:25.840 --> 09:28.571
Go get them.
I want everyone in plain sight.

09:37.920 --> 09:40.844
Okay, uh, obviously
I know exactly what's going on,

09:41.000 --> 09:43.685
but for the sake of these people,
uh, maybe you should explain.

09:43.840 --> 09:45.763
There's a demon in here,

09:45.920 --> 09:48.844
and I'm going to kill him
before he kills all of us.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.731
His name is Baal.

09:51.880 --> 09:54.531
And right now
he's hidden among us.

09:54.680 --> 09:57.251
Exactly,
think that covers the basics.

09:57.400 --> 09:59.846
You see, Baal jumps
from person to person.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.002
Wearing their skin.

10:02.200 --> 10:03.361
Okay, I-l think we got it.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.522
And right now,
he could be in any one of you.

10:05.680 --> 10:08.081
So nobody leaves
until he's dead.

10:08.240 --> 10:11.050
This can't be happening.
This can't be real.

10:11.200 --> 10:12.884
Well, I'm sorry, sweetheart,
but it's true.

10:13.040 --> 10:15.407
- Demons are real.
- Damn straight.

10:15.560 --> 10:17.369
- I seen them.
- Sit down.

10:17.520 --> 10:19.887
- (man groaning)
- Th-this is insane.

10:20.040 --> 10:23.283
Mom. Look, Mom, look.
They're telling the truth, okay?

10:23.440 --> 10:25.886
There was an evil car
that ran down my friends,

10:26.040 --> 10:28.088
and a talking book.

10:28.240 --> 10:31.403
Just one man brave enough
to defeat them all.

10:31.560 --> 10:33.050
- Thank you.
- I meant Pablo.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.645
Pablo: Hmm?

10:36.800 --> 10:40.725
I don't know what you did
to my daughter, Ash Williams,

10:40.880 --> 10:43.770
but I don't need a firearm
to kick your ass.

10:43.920 --> 10:47.402
Okay, clearly the demon is inside
of this walking penis.

10:47.560 --> 10:50.484
Just give me the gun, I'll take care
of him, we'll go for pancakes.

10:50.640 --> 10:53.166
Sorry, Ash,
could just as easily be you.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.924
Hey, come on, sister.
What's the deal?

10:55.080 --> 10:57.481
- Same team.
- Can't take that risk.

10:57.640 --> 10:59.608
You see,
this is what Baal wants.

10:59.800 --> 11:02.167
For us all to start fighting
among ourselves.

11:02.320 --> 11:05.005
He locks us in a cage,
turns us into animals,

11:05.160 --> 11:07.003
and watches us
devour one another.

11:07.160 --> 11:09.811
And then when we're done,
he comes on in

11:09.960 --> 11:11.644
and picks off whoever's left.

11:11.800 --> 11:14.121
Okay, so how do we deal
with this Bill guy,

11:14.280 --> 11:15.930
'cause I can't stop thinking
about pancakes.

11:16.080 --> 11:17.844
- Kelly and Ruby: It's Baal.
- Oh, Jesus.

11:18.720 --> 11:21.200
We need the Kandarian dagger.

11:21.360 --> 11:24.603
- Where is it?
- Oh, someone confiscated it.

11:24.760 --> 11:27.286
Tell me where it is.

11:27.440 --> 11:28.805
Okay-

11:28.960 --> 11:31.042
It's in the evidence locker.

11:31.200 --> 11:33.123
It's just down those stairs.

11:35.440 --> 11:37.488
Now take it easy. Ah!

11:37.640 --> 11:40.291
- Daddy!Dad!
- Jesus!

11:40.440 --> 11:42.124
- (groaning)
- 0h. my God!

11:42.280 --> 11:45.523
It's hot. All yours.

11:45.720 --> 11:47.210
Man: Okay.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.564
We're all dead, aren't we?

11:50.720 --> 11:52.882
Hey, we'll get through this,
all right?

11:59.280 --> 12:01.282

12:38.840 --> 12:40.763

12:40.920 --> 12:42.763
Okay, I need to get in here.

12:42.920 --> 12:44.524

Well, enter it.

- Thank you.

13:12.720 --> 13:14.882
What happened?
Did you guys see...

13:15.040 --> 13:16.724

13:16.880 --> 13:19.804

13:24.560 --> 13:27.370
So, urn, I got a problem.

13:27.960 --> 13:29.246
- (gasps)
- Whoa.

13:30.720 --> 13:33.246
- (whispers) Holy shit.
- It's not what you think.

13:33.400 --> 13:35.607
It feels like something inside of me
that's trying to come out.

13:35.760 --> 13:38.081
It hurts, and... whoa.

13:38.240 --> 13:40.607
What if it's Baal?
What if I'm Baal, guys?

13:40.760 --> 13:43.570
No, don't. Come on, buddy.
That's just a rash.

13:43.720 --> 13:46.929
I mean, I've had a million rashes
in all kinds of funky places, you know?

13:47.080 --> 13:50.926
My armpit, my-my gonads,
my-my butt crack, my butt cheek...

13:51.080 --> 13:53.242
Chet:
Hey, Ash, I'm leaving.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.641
- Whoa.
- You're not going anywhere, numbnuts.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.689
You're not the boss of me.

13:58.760 --> 14:00.808
Anyone consider
it might be in this chick?

14:00.960 --> 14:04.681
Hey, Ash, I think you really need to
tell your friend to shut the fuck up.

14:04.840 --> 14:06.444
You know what?
Maybe it's in him.

14:06.600 --> 14:09.206
- He looks skeezy as shit.
- Chet: Hey, Ash.

14:09.360 --> 14:11.328
How well do you really know
the Mexican, anyway?

14:11.480 --> 14:13.448
Hey, he's not
"the Mexican," okay?

14:13.600 --> 14:15.602
He's Pablo.

14:15.760 --> 14:17.444
Pablo the Mexican.

14:18.960 --> 14:22.601
Yeah, kind of like you're Chet,
Chet the dumb, white guy.

14:22.760 --> 14:25.286
- Chet: No!
- Whoa, that's a little racist, Pablo.

14:25.440 --> 14:28.649
- Apology?
- You're all crazy.

14:28.840 --> 14:31.161
There's no goddamn demon.

14:31.320 --> 14:33.641
It's just this asshole.

14:33.800 --> 14:36.804
Ashy Slashy back to kill us all.

14:36.960 --> 14:39.645
- He's not Ashy Slashy.
- Excuse me?

14:39.800 --> 14:43.122
He-he's the good guy.
He fights against these things.

14:43.280 --> 14:46.409
His friend shoots me in the leg,

14:46.560 --> 14:49.484
- and you're on his side?
- No, Dad, he's on our side.

14:49.640 --> 14:51.324
That's horsecrap,
you better smarten up, young lady...

14:51.480 --> 14:55.485
And you better lay off her,
or I'll pop you one.

14:55.640 --> 14:58.371
- Again.
- You put down the gun and try it.

14:58.520 --> 15:01.091
Um, what happened
between the two of you?

15:01.240 --> 15:02.730
- Stay out of this.
- Thomas.

15:02.920 --> 15:05.366
Honey, this isn't you.
You're-you're hurt.

15:05.520 --> 15:07.249
- You're upset.
- I said shut up.

15:07.400 --> 15:10.847
Hey, easy cowboy.
How do we know it isn't you?

15:11.000 --> 15:14.482
For one thing,
I haven't killed anyone lately.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.762
Yeah, that's right.

15:16.920 --> 15:20.402
Your friend, Ash,
had a visit with Amber.

15:20.600 --> 15:22.329
Cut her head off.

15:22.520 --> 15:23.521
(gasps)

15:25.360 --> 15:27.044
Is it true?

15:27.200 --> 15:30.010
Oh, honey, of course not.

15:30.160 --> 15:32.606
(chuckles)

15:32.760 --> 15:34.046
It's complicated.

15:34.240 --> 15:36.322
Linda:
Oh, God, Ash.

15:37.280 --> 15:39.442
- It is you, isn't it?
- No!No!

15:39.600 --> 15:41.807
- I say we fucking kill him now!
- Calm down, cupcake.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.206
- All right, all right.
- (knife clatters)

15:43.360 --> 15:47.285
All right, everyone
just calm the fuck down.

15:48.200 --> 15:49.884
Ruby said that
this would happen.

15:50.040 --> 15:53.362
That we'd turn into animals
and rip each other's throats out.

15:53.520 --> 15:56.603
And you know what,
that's exactly what Baal wants.

15:56.760 --> 16:00.446
- But it's not safe here.
- (chuckles) Come on, Linda.

16:01.280 --> 16:02.725
I'm still the same Ash,

16:02.880 --> 16:04.803
used to take you out
for burgers every Friday night.

16:04.960 --> 16:06.041
Remember?

16:06.200 --> 16:07.929
- Carving our initials in the bleachers...
- (Linda chuckles)

16:08.080 --> 16:10.208
...having our first kiss
in your mom's Volvo.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.687
- (chuckles)
- That wasn't me.

16:14.120 --> 16:16.122
" Chevy?
- N0pe_

16:16.280 --> 16:17.725
- K-car?
- Oh, my God.

16:17.880 --> 16:20.247
- Pinto?
- I'm just...

16:20.400 --> 16:21.890
Chet: Ash, hey, man.

16:22.080 --> 16:23.730
You know what I said

16:23.880 --> 16:25.086
- about sticking with you?
- Yeah.

16:25.240 --> 16:26.651
- Till the wheels fall off?
- Sure.

16:26.800 --> 16:30.202
Well, um, you know,
if what Emery says is true, than...

16:31.320 --> 16:33.607
- see you, buddy.
- Chet, there's no way I'm a demon!

16:33.800 --> 16:34.847
- You got that?!
- Uh, no.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.923
- Let's take a vote.
- Yeah, let's do that!

16:37.080 --> 16:41.005
If you think Ash is the demon,
raise your hand.

16:42.320 --> 16:45.244
9"°al1in9)

16:45.440 --> 16:48.569
Pablo? Are you okay?

16:54.240 --> 16:57.164
- (clattering)
- How are you not scared?

16:57.320 --> 17:00.563
As long as we've got that dagger,
we have a chance.

17:09.400 --> 17:11.607
What are you doing?

17:11.800 --> 17:14.007
You are scared, aren't you?

17:14.160 --> 17:16.685
It's written all over your face.

17:16.839 --> 17:18.648
I don't get scared.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.450
(chuckles)

17:22.560 --> 17:24.483
Of course you do.

17:24.640 --> 17:26.130
You're only human.

17:26.280 --> 17:27.805
(bar clatters)

17:27.960 --> 17:29.530
Well, actually...

17:29.680 --> 17:31.921
Shh.

17:34.080 --> 17:37.323
(whispers)
You're not fooling anyone, Ruby.

17:57.120 --> 17:59.088
You're safe now.

17:59.240 --> 18:02.130
You don't have to be
scared anymore.

18:21.960 --> 18:24.361
(groaning)

18:25.840 --> 18:27.604
(yelling)

18:47.720 --> 18:49.290
Hey, toots.

18:49.480 --> 18:51.323
Long time no see.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.844
(electricity crackles)

18:57.720 --> 19:00.724
(sighs)
That's better.

19:00.880 --> 19:03.565
You always liked me in black.

19:04.720 --> 19:06.404
Come to Daddy.

19:06.560 --> 19:08.244
(yells)

19:10.840 --> 19:13.571
Now, you don't mind
if I take this, do you?

19:13.720 --> 19:15.370
(gasping)

19:16.800 --> 19:19.485
Now, we had a deal, remember?

19:24.840 --> 19:27.605
(breathlessly)
I remember. I remem...

19:27.760 --> 19:30.001
You murdered them.

19:30.160 --> 19:32.083
You betrayed me.

19:32.240 --> 19:34.641
I III:

19:34.800 --> 19:36.768
Oh, what?

19:36.920 --> 19:40.049
Oh, you think you could
keep your mortality a secret, huh?

19:43.600 --> 19:46.171
You were so beautiful.

19:46.320 --> 19:48.129
Now you're growing old.

19:50.120 --> 19:51.884
Like these maggots.

19:54.040 --> 19:56.520
And you're going to die slowly.

19:57.560 --> 19:59.608
Like these maggots.

19:59.800 --> 20:01.564
Maybe.

20:02.720 --> 20:06.281
But first, I'm going to send you
back to hell where you belong.

20:06.440 --> 20:08.442
And how exactly?

20:08.640 --> 20:12.201
The Necronomicon is gone,
and I'm up here.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.482
I'm here to stay, Ruby,

20:15.640 --> 20:19.122
and you get to watch me burn
your world to the ground.

20:19.320 --> 20:20.481
<i>Never.</i>

20:26.320 --> 20:29.244
How are you going to stop me?

20:30.240 --> 20:34.211
You think your precious Jefe
is going to be the savior of humanity?

20:34.360 --> 20:36.966
You get to watch me break him.

20:40.080 --> 20:42.208
I'd love to tell you more,

20:42.360 --> 20:44.966
but I got to scat, alley cat.

20:48.320 --> 20:51.403
Uaughs)

20:53.600 --> 20:55.364
I feel it spreading, Jefe.

20:55.560 --> 20:56.686
It hurts.

20:56.840 --> 20:59.525
I can feel it spreading
all over my body, guys.

20:59.680 --> 21:01.091
(indistinct whispering)

21:01.280 --> 21:03.009
ls there any pain killers
in this thing?

21:04.160 --> 21:05.730
- Lacey: Dad, no!
- Fuck!

21:05.880 --> 21:09.009
Stay back!
I don't want to hurt you.

21:09.200 --> 21:10.645
Yet.

21:12.440 --> 21:13.601
(grunts)

21:14.840 --> 21:16.604
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad,
don't-don't hurt him!

21:16.760 --> 21:19.206
Hand that gun over
before you do something really stupid.

21:19.360 --> 21:22.569
- Is it you?
- The truth is I don't know.

21:22.720 --> 21:25.121
- I'll see you in hell.
- No!

21:25.280 --> 21:28.568
Wait, wait, wait, uh, wait, wait, wait.
You're-you're not thinking straight.

21:28.760 --> 21:31.684
He-he might be innocent.

21:32.720 --> 21:34.131
- No.
- Thomas, yes.

21:34.280 --> 21:35.725
No.

21:35.880 --> 21:38.406
Someone's got to restore
law and order to this place.

21:38.560 --> 21:40.767
No, but you can't just kill him!

21:40.920 --> 21:43.685
Baal:
Yes, you can.

21:45.160 --> 21:48.050
Don't you ever shut the fuck up?!

21:48.240 --> 21:50.208
- (gasps) Thomas.
- Oh, my God.

21:52.560 --> 21:54.085
Baby, I'm sorry.

21:54.240 --> 21:56.447

24:49.040 --> 24:51.805
Linda, are you all right?

24:51.960 --> 24:54.327

I messed up.

24:54.480 --> 24:56.289
I know that, and I'm sorry.

24:56.440 --> 24:58.283
But I'm here now,
and I'll keep you and Lacey safe.

24:58.440 --> 24:59.930
- I swear!
- Don't touch me.

25:00.080 --> 25:02.003
- Honey.
- It's over!

25:03.960 --> 25:06.884
Your mother drove a Volkswagen.

25:08.680 --> 25:12.002
Yeah, and you stole it.

25:12.160 --> 25:13.969
- And crashed it.
- Damn right I did.

25:14.120 --> 25:17.283
But you know what, it's not my fault,
because I was totally wasted.

25:17.440 --> 25:20.284

It's okay. It's okay.
